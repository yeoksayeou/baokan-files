The Australian Gorton government, disregarding the interests of its own people, is intensifying military preparations at home and acting as a lackey for U.S. imperialism abroad, collaborating with U.S. imperialism in its new aggressive schemes in Southeast Asia.

According to Gorton's announcement on the 20th, Australia's military expenditure for the 1968-1969 fiscal year will reach a record $1.25 billion, an increase of 11.8% over the current fiscal year.

    澳政府追随美帝加紧扩军备战
    澳大利亚戈顿政府不顾本国人民利益，在国内加紧扩军备战，在国外充当美帝国主义的马前卒，配合美帝国主义在东南亚策动新的侵略阴谋。
    据戈顿二十日宣布，在一九六八——一九六九财政年度里，澳大利亚的军费总数将达到十二亿五千万美元的纪录，比本财政年度增加百分之十一点八。
