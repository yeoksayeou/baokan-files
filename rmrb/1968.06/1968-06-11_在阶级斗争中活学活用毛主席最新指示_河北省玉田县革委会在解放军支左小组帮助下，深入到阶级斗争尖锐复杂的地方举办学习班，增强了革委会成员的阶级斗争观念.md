To effectively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes in the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the broad revolutionary masses led by it and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie," the Revolutionary Committee of Yutian County, Hebei Province, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support group, organized study classes in areas where class struggle is intense and complex. Through learning and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions in the midst of struggle, the committee members' awareness of class struggle and line struggle has been heightened, enabling them to firmly grasp the initiative in attacking class enemies. This has further consolidated and strengthened the dictatorship of the proletariat, leading to a great leap forward in the county's revolutionary and production efforts.

After the establishment of the county's Revolutionary Committee, some members initially developed a sense of complacency, believing that the committee had authority, that anarchist tendencies had been curbed, and that hidden class enemies had been exposed. They thought that their work was "good enough." As a result, the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions at the grassroots level became half-hearted. To address this situation, the county Revolutionary Committee investigated the intense and complex class struggle in some communes, institutions, and schools, gaining significant insights. They convened a standing committee meeting to discuss these issues. The members realized that in the face of a good situation, some committee members had developed a sense of self-satisfaction and relaxed their fighting spirit, which was a manifestation of not deeply understanding and inadequately implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions on class struggle. Therefore, they decided to organize a study class on Mao Zedong Thought in areas where class struggle is intense and complex, involving members of the county Revolutionary Committee and grassroots Revolutionary Committee leaders. They linked the study to actual class struggle facts and Chairman Mao's latest instructions on class struggle.

The study class was held in a brigade where class struggle was particularly intense and complex. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions on class struggle, the brigade's leadership mobilized the masses to conduct extensive class education through reminiscences and comparisons, deepening the poor and lower-middle peasants' class feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao and arousing their deep hatred for Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of class enemies. With a strong sense of enemy awareness, they launched attacks on class enemies, uncovering two Kuomintang spies who had been hiding for nearly twenty years. The study class focused on these two living examples, conducting criticism and struggle with the poor and lower-middle peasants. The peasants angrily exposed and denounced how these spies colluded with unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to manipulate mass organizations, instigate armed conflicts, and direct the struggle against the poor and lower-middle peasants, reversing the direction of the struggle. These vivid class struggle facts greatly enhanced the study class members' awareness of class struggle and ignited their revolutionary fighting spirit.

The study class also invited representatives from several advanced units to share their experiences in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and effectively striking a small handful of class enemies. Each member of the county Revolutionary Committee received profound education. Some members deeply felt that "intense class struggle areas are the best classrooms for learning Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle. Grassroots revolutionary cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants are our best teachers, and firsthand materials obtained through personal practice are the most vivid. The Revolutionary Committee must step out of the office to command the battle if it wants to grasp the initiative in leading the county's revolutionary people to attack class enemies!" The leading cadres participating in the study class unanimously recognized that among all tasks, the most fundamental is to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions; among all focuses, not focusing on class struggle is misguided; among all busyness, not deeply engaging in frontline command is ineffective.

As soon as the study class ended, the county Revolutionary Committee immediately concentrated its efforts on intensifying class struggle. Except for leaving three committee members on duty, other committee members and general staff formed Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, going deep into the grassroots to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions, implementing face-to-face leadership, and setting examples for the entire region. They went to some villages where class struggle was relatively complex, mobilizing the masses to wage a "people's war." In Daan Town's Shihe Brigade, as soon as the leadership was established, a small handful of class enemies started causing trouble behind the scenes, disrupting revolutionary unity, and viciously attacking the brigade's leadership. After the propaganda team entered the village, they helped the brigade's leadership mobilize the masses to launch a revolutionary criticism campaign, launching a fierce attack on class enemies, and bringing a new situation to the brigade's revolution and production.

    在阶级斗争中活学活用毛主席最新指示
    河北省玉田县革委会在解放军支左小组帮助下，深入到阶级斗争尖锐复杂的地方举办学习班，增强了革委会成员的阶级斗争观念
    本报讯　为了很好地落实毛主席关于“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续”的最新指示，河北省玉田县革命委员会，在解放军支左小组的帮助下，到阶级斗争尖锐、复杂的地方开办毛泽东思想学习班，在斗争中学，在斗争中用，提高了革委会成员的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，从而牢牢地把握住向阶级敌人进攻的主动权，进一步巩固和加强了无产阶级专政，使全县革命和生产出现了一派大好景象。
    这个县的革命委员会成立以后，部分成员一度产生了“松劲”情绪，以为革命委员会有权威了，无政府主义思潮刹住了，一些暗藏的阶级敌人挖出来了，工作做得“差不离”了。上面的“弦”一松，基层单位对毛主席最新指示的落实，就出现了“夹生饭”的现象。针对这种情况，县革命委员会调查了部分公社、机关和学校的阶级斗争尖锐复杂的情况，受到很大教育。他们带着这些问题，召开了常委会，汇集情况，研究问题。大家认识到：在大好形势下，革委会一些成员滋长了“自满”情绪，松懈了战斗意志，是对毛主席关于阶级斗争的最新指示理解不深、执行不力的表现。因此，他们决定在阶级斗争尖锐、复杂的地方举办有县革委会成员以及基层革委会负责同志参加的毛泽东思想学习班，联系阶级斗争事实，学习毛主席关于阶级斗争的最新指示。
    学习班所在的地方，是全县阶级斗争比较激烈复杂的一个大队。在毛主席关于阶级斗争的最新指示的光辉照耀下，这个大队的领导班子放手发动群众，大搞回忆对比的阶级教育，增强了贫下中农对伟大领袖毛主席无比深厚的阶级感情，激发大家对中国赫鲁晓夫及一小撮阶级敌人的刻骨仇恨。他们带着强烈的敌情观念向阶级敌人发动进攻，挖出了两个潜伏近二十年的国民党特务。学习班抓住这两个活靶子，和贫下中农一道进行批判斗争。贫下中农愤怒揭发控诉了这两个特务勾结没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，在幕后操纵群众组织不断挑起武斗，把矛头指向贫下中农，扭转斗争大方向的种种罪行。活生生的阶级斗争事实，大大增强了学习班成员的阶级斗争观念，激起他们的革命斗争意志。
    学习班还请了几个先进单位的代表，介绍他们怎样落实毛主席的最新指示，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人的经验。县革命委员会的每一个成员，都受到了深刻的教育。有的成员深有体会地说：“阶级斗争尖锐的地方，是我们学习毛主席关于阶级斗争的教导的最好的课堂，基层革命干部和贫下中农是我们最好的老师，亲身实践得来的第一手材料最生动。革命委员会要想掌握带领全县革命人民向阶级敌人进攻的主动权，必须走出办公室指挥战斗！”参加学习班的领导干部一致认识到：这任务那任务，全面落实毛主席的最新指示是最根本的任务；抓这抓那，不抓阶级斗争就是瞎抓；千忙万忙，不深入第一线指挥战斗就忙不到点子上。
    学习班刚结束，县革命委员会立即集中力量狠抓阶级斗争。除了留下三个委员值班以外，其他委员和一般工作人员组成毛泽东思想宣传队，深入下去宣传毛主席的最新指示，实行面对面领导，抓典型，带全局。他们深入一些阶级斗争比较复杂的村子，放手发动群众打“人民战争”。大安镇石河大队，领导班子刚建立，一小撮阶级敌人就在背后捣鬼，破坏革命大联合，恶毒攻击大队领导班子。宣传队进村以后，便帮助大队领导班子发动群众开展革命大批判，向阶级敌人猛烈进攻，使全大队的革命和生产出现了新气象。
