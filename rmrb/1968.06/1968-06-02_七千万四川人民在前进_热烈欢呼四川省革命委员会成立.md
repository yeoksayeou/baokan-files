The radiant sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the entire Sichuan region. The Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Committee has been born in glory! This is a major event in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! This is another great victory for Mao Zedong Thought! This is another great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

With deep proletarian feelings, we extend our fighting greetings to the proletarian revolutionary forces and the 70 million people of Sichuan who are advancing victoriously in the fierce class struggle, and to all the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Sichuan!

Sichuan is a strategic rear area of China. Since liberation, class struggle has remained extremely sharp. The Chinese Khrushchev and the clique of top capitalist roaders within the Party, along with their agents in Southwest China and Sichuan such as Li Pingyuan, Liao Zhigao, Ren Baige, and Huang Xinting, have blocked Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary voice, suppressed the proletarian revolutionary forces, and in every possible way promoted counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods on all fronts. They attempted to make Sichuan their "independent kingdom" for anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought activities, aiming to restore capitalism in Sichuan. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, this clique further colluded with the remaining reactionary forces of the Kuomintang, fiercely counterattacking the revolutionary masses, stirring up trouble, creating divisions, disrupting military-civilian unity, inciting the masses to fight each other, and repeatedly whipping up rightist winds of reversal, making desperate struggles.

Throughout the course of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Sichuan, there has been a fierce struggle between Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the bourgeois reactionary line.

Great Leader Chairman Mao has paid great attention to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Sichuan, providing many extremely important instructions. When the struggle of the Sichuan proletarian revolutionary forces was still quite arduous, Chairman Mao pointed out with great wisdom: "Sichuan has great hope." The Sichuan revolutionary people, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, under the close care and leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, have followed the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, forged ahead bravely, and through repeated and tortuous struggles, have defeated wave after wave of capitalist restoration, finally achieving decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Sichuan.

The People's Liberation Army stationed in Sichuan has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, extensively and deeply propagated Mao Zedong Thought, firmly supported the proletarian revolutionary forces, and resolutely defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, striking at the enemy's sabotage and establishing outstanding merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution under the conditions of socialism, where the proletariat opposes the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary masses it leads, and the Kuomintang reactionaries. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie."

Comrades of the proletarian revolutionary forces must clearly see: the class enemies are never willing to die. The great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution cannot make us complacent. The remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist roaders who have infiltrated the Party, and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in society who have not been reformed, will seize any opportunity to stage a comeback: they attempt to reverse the verdict on the bourgeois reactionary line, to reverse the verdict on the top capitalist roaders within the Party, and to reverse the verdict on the overthrown class enemies. Rightist winds of reversal have occurred in the past, are occurring now, and will occur in the future, which is nothing to be surprised about. We must resolutely smash the rightist winds of reversal, carry out a sustained and in-depth revolutionary criticism, thoroughly expose and criticize the top capitalist roaders within the Party and their agents in Sichuan, fight them down and expose their stench. We must strengthen our awareness of the enemy, unite the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, do a good job of cleaning up the class ranks, and root out the few traitors, imperialist and Kuomintang reactionary spies, and other counter-revolutionaries who are hiding in dark corners, making trouble, and sabotaging Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, further consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie."

Chairman Mao's instruction thoroughly exposes the counter-revolutionary essence common to all forms of bourgeois dictatorship in the world, thoroughly exposes the counter-revolutionary essence of the bourgeois reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev, and points out to us the great historical significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat.

We must seriously study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and, in our work, always believe in and rely on the broad masses of the people, respect the initiative of the masses, fully mobilize the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, and press on to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, run Mao Zedong Thought study classes well, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions.

Comrades of the proletarian revolutionary forces must resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and firmly grasp the direction of the struggle. We must distinguish between two types of contradictions of different natures, distinguish between the mainstream and the secondary currents, and always direct the spearhead of the struggle at the handful of class enemies. We must not fall for the tricks of the bad elements. We must cherish and support the revolutionary committees, consolidate and develop the revolutionary committees, support and endorse the People's Liberation Army, protect the people, and on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, continuously strengthen the firm unity of the leading core of the revolutionary committees, strengthen the firm unity between the military and the people, and strengthen the firm unity among the revolutionary mass organizations. We must be vigilant against rightist splitism. We must develop great alliances and three-in-one combinations by system, by industry, and by class, and thoroughly smash all the tricks and conspiracies of the class enemies to split the proletarian revolutionary ranks.

We are confident that the revolutionary people of Sichuan, with their glorious revolutionary traditions, will certainly be able to, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness," better complete the tasks of industrial and agricultural production and various basic construction projects, and achieve an overall victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The day when revolutionary committees are established in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country is not far off. Let us welcome this glorious moment!

    七千万四川人民在前进
    ——热烈欢呼四川省革命委员会成立
    《人民日报》《解放军报》社论
    毛泽东思想的灿烂阳光，照遍了巴山蜀水，四川省革命委员会光荣诞生了！这是无产阶级文化大革命运动中的一件大事！这是毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利！这是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的又一伟大胜利！
    我们怀着深厚的无产阶级感情，向在剧烈的阶级斗争中胜利前进的四川的无产阶级革命派和全省七千万人民，向人民解放军驻四川的全体指战员，致以战斗的敬礼！
    四川，是我国的战略后方。解放以来，阶级斗争仍然十分尖锐。中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大一小撮走资派，和他们在西南及四川地区的代理人李井泉、廖志高、任白戈、黄新廷之流，封锁毛主席的无产阶级革命声音，打击无产阶级革命派，千方百计地在各条战线上推行反革命修正主义黑货，企图把四川当作他们反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的“独立王国”，在四川复辟资本主义。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他们这一小撮又和社会上残留的国民党反动势力进一步勾结起来，猖狂向革命群众进行反扑，挑拨离间，制造分裂，破坏军民团结，挑动群众斗群众，一次又一次刮起右倾翻案妖风，进行垂死的挣扎。
    在四川无产阶级文化大革命的历程中，贯串着毛主席的革命路线同资产阶级反动路线两条路线的剧烈斗争。
    伟大领袖毛主席，非常关心四川的无产阶级文化大革命，作了许多极其重要的指示。当四川无产阶级革命派的斗争还处在相当艰苦的时候，毛主席就英明地指出：“四川很有希望”。无限忠于毛主席的四川革命人民，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的亲切关怀和领导下，按照毛主席指出的方向，勇往直前，经过反复曲折的斗争，击退了一次次资本主义复辟逆流，终于取得了四川无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。
    人民解放军驻四川部队，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，广泛深入地宣传毛泽东思想，坚决支持无产阶级革命派，坚决捍卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，打击了阶级敌人的破坏，在无产阶级文化大革命中建立了卓越的功勋。
    毛主席指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”
    无产阶级革命派的同志们，必须清醒地看到：阶级敌人总是不甘心死亡的。无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，决不能使我们麻痹起来。一小撮国民党反动派的残渣余孽，混进党内的叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派，社会上没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，他们一有机会就要搞翻案：妄想为资产阶级反动路线翻案，为党内最大的一小撮走资派翻案，为被打倒的阶级敌人翻案。右倾翻案和反右倾翻案，是资产阶级复辟和无产阶级反复辟斗争的一个重要表现。右倾翻案风过去有，现在有，将来还会有，不足为怪。我们要坚决粉碎右倾翻案风，开展持久而深入的革命大批判，把党内最大一小撮走资派和他们在四川的代理人揭深批透、斗倒斗臭。要加强敌情观念，努力团结广大革命群众和革命干部，做好清理阶级队伍的工作，把那些藏在阴暗角落里兴风作浪、破坏毛主席伟大战略部署的极少数的叛徒、帝国主义和国民党反动派的特务及其他反革命分子挖出来，进一步巩固无产阶级专政。
    毛主席最近指出：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”
    毛主席这一指示，透彻地揭露了世界上一切形式的资产阶级专政共同的反革命本质，透彻地揭露了中国赫鲁晓夫资产阶级反动路线的反革命本质，向我们指出了无产阶级文化大革命对巩固无产阶级专政的伟大历史意义。
    我们要认真学习毛主席的最新指示，在自己工作中，永远要相信和依靠广大人民群众，尊重群众的首创精神，充分发挥群众的革命积极性，乘胜前进，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，办好毛泽东思想学习班，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示。
    无产阶级革命派的同志们，要坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，牢牢掌握斗争大方向。要区别两类不同性质的矛盾，区别主流和支流，始终把斗争矛头对准一小撮阶级敌人，切不可中了坏人的挑拨。要爱护和支持革命委员会，巩固和发展革命委员会，支持和拥护人民解放军，保护人民群众，在毛泽东思想的原则基础上，不断增强革命委员会领导核心的坚强团结，增强军民之间的坚强团结，增强革命群众组织之间的坚强团结，警惕右倾分裂主义。要发展按系统、按行业、按班级的革命的大联合和革命的三结合，彻底粉碎阶级敌人分裂无产阶级革命队伍的一切阴谋诡计。
    我们坚信，具有光荣革命传统的四川革命人民，一定能够在毛主席“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大方针指引下，更好地完成工农业生产和各项基本建设任务，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利。
    全国各省、市、自治区全部成立革命委员会的日子，已经不远了，让我们迎接这个光辉时刻的到来吧！
