Last August to the end of last year, our company was far from the leadership organs and went to Anfu County, Jiangxi Province, to carry out the "Three Supports, Two Military" tasks. This county covers hundreds of square miles and has a population of 280,000. The county seat has more than 60 units of party, government, mass, and industrial, commercial, cultural, educational, and judicial organizations. The countryside has 21 people's communes. Our company was able to complete the "Three Supports, Two Military" tasks in this large county relatively satisfactorily and, together with the revolutionary masses of the entire county, achieved decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This was due to the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the support of the revolutionary masses of the entire county, and the efforts of all the soldiers in our company who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

Here, we will introduce how we followed Chairman Mao's teachings, believed in the masses, relied on the masses, respected the masses' pioneering spirit, and fully utilized the role of all the soldiers in our company.

Believing in the Masses, Relying on the Masses, and Sending the Broad Masses of Soldiers to the Stormy Sea for Tempering

Anfu County is located in the revolutionary cradle of Jinggangshan. Last August, when the two classes, two lines, and two roads were fiercely struggling here, our company entered the county and was immediately warmly welcomed by the revolutionary masses. The company headquarters was always crowded with workers, peasants, students, government officials, and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations from all over the county. They all had deep class feelings of trust in the children of the people sent by Chairman Mao and eagerly requested that we send cadres and soldiers to their units to support the left. Seeing this scene, we were both excited and moved. The party committee immediately held a meeting to discuss the issue of sending all the cadres and soldiers in the company to various units to carry out the "Three Supports, Two Military" tasks. At the party committee meeting, on the one hand, everyone thought: The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is excellent, and we should seize this good opportunity to deploy the troops, ride the east wind to break through ten thousand waves, and push the Cultural Revolution in Anfu County forward; on the other hand, the company's cadres were divided into many tasks, and it was felt that there were too many points and the soldiers were too scattered, and there were not enough cadres. There was a concern that after being deployed, the soldiers would lose command, and the company's thoughts and actions would not be unified, and mistakes would be made in the work. Should we deploy or not? We brought this question to the study of Chairman Mao's teachings: "The masses are the real heroes," "The people have limitless creativity," "We must trust the masses, rely on the masses, and respect the masses' pioneering spirit." Chairman Mao's great teachings made us realize that the question of "deploying or not deploying" is essentially a question of attitude towards the masses and a question of whether to trust the masses. Everyone said that the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin sent our company to Anfu County to support the left, which is the greatest trust in all the cadres and soldiers of our company. At that time, the party committee proposed: Chairman Mao trusts me, I trust Chairman Mao; Chairman Mao relies on me, I rely on Chairman Mao. We firmly believe that the revolutionary soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought can complete the glorious tasks entrusted by Chairman Mao, and we firmly believe that the revolutionary masses of Anfu County will follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions, love the People's Liberation Army, and support our work. Chairman Mao's teachings unified our understanding, and the party committee decided to immediately deploy the troops and made specific arrangements, such as sending the cooks to three restaurants, the clerks, buglers, messengers, and medical personnel to the county hospital, middle school, and villages, and sending the soldiers to the government offices, factories, and countryside, and so on.

The party committee's decision was enthusiastically supported by all the soldiers in the company. The cadres and soldiers packed their bags with revolutionary classics, held the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," brought Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and with hearts full of love and loyalty to Chairman Mao, they confidently set out to the front line of the "Three Supports, Two Military."

Believing in the Masses, Relying on the Masses, and Using Great Mao Zedong Thought to Guide Soldiers to Learn Swimming While Swimming

The company's personnel were fully deployed. The soldiers were very enthusiastic, and the party committee almost received reports of good situations every day. However, some soldiers encountered problems in their work and called for the leadership to come up with solutions, and some even wrote letters saying they had no experience and requested that cadres be sent to strengthen leadership. In this situation, some cadres were also worried and suggested "shortening the front" and "not opening the mouth too wide," while others proposed to withdraw cadres to strengthen leadership.

What should we do? At the party committee meeting, we studied Chairman Mao's teachings and Vice Chairman Lin's instructions with these questions in mind. Chairman Mao said: "Learning war from war—this is our main method." "Revolutionary war is the people's business, often not learning first and then doing, but doing and then learning, doing is learning." Vice Chairman Lin said: "The people armed with Mao Zedong Thought become the wisest and bravest, and can unleash boundless power!" Chairman Mao's great teachings and Vice Chairman Lin's instructions made our thoughts clear. We firmly believe that as long as we continuously arm the soldiers' minds with Mao Zedong Thought and guide the soldiers' practice with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the soldiers will be able to see far and clear in the complex class struggle, have many solutions, and learn to swim while swimming.

After this, the party committee members no longer passively considered how to "shorten the front" and "replace personnel," but actively studied how to guide each soldier, according to their different situations, to actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, to act according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and to increase their abilities from practical struggles.

New soldier Li Jianjun, who went to support the left at the Anfu County Printing Plant, would call for leadership to come up with solutions when encountering problems. After the party committee's discussion, it was believed that the soldier's timely reporting when encountering problems was correct, but it also reflected that this comrade lacked the courage to handle problems according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions. It was necessary to inspire him that as long as he resolutely acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions, there would be no problems that could not be solved and no difficulties that could not be overcome. Once, Li Jianjun called back to report that the "revolutionary faction" had "emerged" in the factory, whether to support it or not? Party committee secretary Cao Zusan, after receiving the call, did not rush to express his opinion, but instead, based on his active thoughts, studied Vice Chairman Lin's instructions with him: "This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the supreme commander is our Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is the commander-in-chief. Under the command of the great commander-in-chief, we should listen well to our commander-in-chief—Chairman Mao's words, and the Cultural Revolution will definitely develop smoothly and achieve great victories!" Then he encouraged him: In work, be bold, and do everything big and special if it is in line with Mao Zedong Thought! Li Jianjun was greatly inspired. He studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad left-wing masses" and "Protect the left, support the left, and build and expand the left-wing forces" with the problems in mind, and his mind became clear. He told himself, right! Wherever Chairman Mao's hand points, I will go there, and whatever Chairman Mao says, I will do it. Resolutely act according to the supreme commander Chairman Mao's instructions, and even if it's just one leftist, I will firmly support them. He immediately expressed his support for the proletarian revolutionary faction of the printing plant and quickly expanded the left-wing forces in the factory.

In this way, the broad masses of soldiers in our company, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, were tempered in practical struggles, raised their awareness of the two-line struggle, and learned the skills of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Believing in the Masses, Relying on the Masses, and Using the Experiences Summarized by the Masses Themselves to Educate the Masses

The revolution is advancing, and the situation is developing. To ensure that all the cadres and soldiers in the company can follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment on the "Three Supports, Two Military" posts, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and help the revolutionary masses advance bravely, it is necessary to continuously introduce and promote advanced experiences.

Where do experiences come from? At the party committee meeting, everyone studied Chairman Mao's teachings on the mass line. Chairman Mao said: "In a certain sense, the wisest and most talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience." Chairman Mao's teachings made us realize that experiences come from the soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought on the front line of struggle. The party committee must be good at summarizing the experiences created by the masses under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought in practice and promoting them, using the masses' experiences to educate the masses.

The party committee summarized the experience of the support-left group in Zhouhu Commune. Zhouhu Commune has nearly 30,000 people, in addition to the production teams of the commune, there are also 21 enterprise units such as the county textile mill and the provincial construction team. The three young soldiers who went to carry out the support-left task were: Squad Leader Chen Changjian, soldiers Yu Tianxi, and Zhang Qinqing. When they first arrived, the situation was complex and the tasks were arduous. At that time, some deceived masses in this place had not yet awakened, and many cadres had not yet been liberated; the "class struggle is extinguished" theory and the "three selfs and one package" fallacies of China's Khrushchev had not yet been strongly criticized here; the summer grain procurement task had not yet been completed; autumn harvest and winter sowing were imminent. These three revolutionary soldiers loyal to Chairman Mao firmly believed that following Chairman Mao is victory. They brought the complex problems to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, repeatedly studied and understood Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and realized that: It is necessary to put the mobilization of the masses to actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought and carry out revolutionary criticism and struggle in the first place. As long as the big criticism is done well, the main contradiction is grasped, and other work will definitely be brought up. Therefore, the three of them, every day, held high the portrait of Chairman Mao, brought Chairman Mao's latest instructions, went door to door to the masses to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, exposed the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev against the party, against socialism, and against Mao Zedong Thought, and organized the poor and lower-middle peasants to carry out revolutionary criticism and struggle. In a few days, a high tide of revolutionary criticism and struggle swept across the entire commune. Through criticism and struggle, the awareness of class struggle and the two-line struggle of the commune members rapidly increased, and they stood up to denounce the heinous crimes of the bourgeois reactionary line. The revolutionary cadres of the commune and teams bravely stood out, seized the revolution, and promoted production. The commune quickly established a temporary leading group, and in a short time, the summer grain procurement task was overfulfilled, and autumn harvest and winter sowing were well done. The entire commune presented a prosperous revolutionary scene. The three young soldiers' experience was: Don't be afraid of no experience, just be afraid of no practice. As long as you practice seriously under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, even if it is a great difficulty like the Yangtze River, it will become a "bridge flying across south and north, turning the barrier into a thoroughfare."

Our party committee widely promoted the experience of these three soldiers throughout the company, which greatly promoted the company's "Three Supports, Two Military" work. Later, we mobilized the soldiers executing the "Three Supports, Two Military" tasks on various fronts such as factories, schools, government offices, and countryside to boldly practice and seriously practice under the guidance of the great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao's practice theory, and summarize experiences from practice. We introduced and promoted the experiences and moving deeds that the soldiers themselves summarized from practice throughout the company, so that everyone could learn from each other and promote each other, and successfully completed the support-left tasks entrusted by Chairman Mao.

Believing in the Masses, Relying on the Masses, and Passing on the Party's Fine Tradition of Close Ties with the Masses to the Broad Masses of Soldiers

With the continuous victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the entire county, our party committee also considered the following question: It is necessary to pass on the belief in the masses, reliance on the masses, and the fine tradition of the party's close ties with the masses to the local revolutionary cadres and the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, so that they can lead the revolutionary masses to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and achieve decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Several comrades from our company's kitchen went to support the left at the Anfu Restaurant. One day, we went to inspect their work and found that the leader of the revolutionary mass organization in the restaurant, Wang Shihua, was busy all day, working hard, not paying attention to mobilizing the masses, and got sick from overwork, and the masses still had complaints. We seized this opportunity and, together with the comrades from the kitchen, studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "We communists are like seeds, and the people are like the land. When we go to a place, we must combine with the people there, take root, and blossom in the people" and the related teachings on the mass line, and told them that in the support-left work, whether to take a temporary attitude to support for a while or to take a long-term perspective to set an example, pass on the style, and leave a propaganda team of Mao Zedong Thought that never leaves? This is also an important sign of whether our support-left work is good or not.

Under the party committee's education and help, the comrades from the kitchen decided to pass on the style and set an example in the support-left work, leaving the revolutionary spirit of resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Kitchen squad leader Cai Zhihua and the leader of the revolutionary mass organization in the restaurant, Wang Shihua, formed a "red pair." Cai Zhihua, based on Wang Shihua's shortcomings of not being good at mobilizing the masses when there are things to do, studied Chairman Mao's teachings on the mass line with her. In actual work, Cai Zhihua also set an example in everything, helping Wang Shihua to learn how to use the mass line working method. Under the patient help of the kitchen squad leader, Wang Shihua's mass perspective was greatly enhanced, and she consulted with the masses for everything and relied on the masses in everything, and her work made great progress. The comrades from the kitchen also brought their deep class feelings of loving Chairman Mao and the fine tradition of ideological and political work of the army into the restaurant, helping the revolutionary staff to establish institutions such as "daily reading" and actively carrying out heart-to-heart talks and "one helps one, one red pair" activities, making the revolutionary staff of the restaurant learn from Chairman Mao's works become the norm. Later, the comrades from the kitchen left Anfu Restaurant, and the revolutionary staff of Anfu Restaurant followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and both revolution and production were well done. We promptly promoted the experience of the comrades from the kitchen, which made the "Three Supports, Two Military" work develop further.

After the great leader Chairman Mao issued the great call to establish learning classes, we believed that this was an important way to popularize Mao Zedong Thought and make Mao Zedong Thought take root in Anfu County for generations. We first went with a few soldiers to the county leadership organs to establish Mao Zedong Thought learning classes, making the revolutionary masses deepen their understanding of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and summarize the experience of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. We promptly promoted the experience of the county leadership organs implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and establishing good Mao Zedong Thought learning classes, and quickly launched a high tide of establishing Mao Zedong Thought learning classes throughout the county. The organs established them, the streets established them, the schools established them, the industrial and mining enterprises established them, and the rural people's communes also established them. They trained a large number of instructors for studying Chairman Mao's works, sowed red seeds, and laid a good foundation for launching a more extensive mass movement of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works throughout the county.

    用毛泽东思想武装起来的群众有无限的创造力
    人民解放军某部活学活用毛主席著作先进集体、某团一营机枪连党支部
    去年八月到去年年底，我们连远离领导机关，到江西省安福县去担任“三支”“两军”工作。这个县方圆数百里，共有二十八万人口，县城里有党、政、群和工交、财贸、文教、政法等机关团体六十多个单位，农村有二十一个人民公社。我们一个连之所以能够在这样一个大县里比较圆满地完成那一阶段的“三支”“两军”任务，和全县广大革命群众一道夺取了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利，靠的是毛主席的英明领导，靠的是战无不胜的毛泽东思想，靠的是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，靠的是全县广大革命群众的支持，也靠用毛泽东思想武装起来的全连战士的努力奋斗。
    这里，介绍一下我们是怎样遵照毛主席的教导，相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，充分发挥全连战士作用的。
      相信群众，依靠群众，让广大战士
  到大风大浪中去锻炼
    安福县地处革命摇篮井冈山地区。去年八月，正当这里两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线激烈搏斗的时刻，我们连一进入县境，立即受到广大革命群众的热烈欢迎。连部整天都挤满了来自全县各条战线的工人、农民、学生、机关干部和革命群众组织的负责人，他们都怀着无限信赖毛主席派来的子弟兵的深厚阶级感情，迫切要求我们把干部战士派到他们的单位去支左。我们看到这个场面，既兴奋又激动，支委会马上召开会议，研究派全连干部战士到各单位去执行“三支”“两军”任务的问题。支委会上，大家一方面认为：当前无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，要抓住大好时机把部队撒开，乘东风破万里浪，把安福县文化大革命推向前进；而另一方面，连队干部一分工，又觉得点太多，战士太分散，干部不够用，耽心撒出去以后，战士失去了指挥，连队的思想、行动无法统一，在工作中出差错。究竟撒不撒？我们带着这个问题，学习了毛主席的教导：“群众是真正的英雄”，“人民群众有无限的创造力”，“要信任群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神。”毛主席的伟大教导，使我们认识到，
  “撒不撒”的问题，实质是对待群众的态度问题，是信不信任群众的问题。大家说，以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部把我们连派到安福县来支左，就是对我们全连干部战士的最大信任。当时，支委会提出：毛主席相信我相信，毛主席依靠我依靠，坚信用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士能够完成毛主席交给的光荣任务，坚信安福县广大革命群众会遵照毛主席的最新指示，热爱解放军，支持我们的工作。毛主席的教导统一了我们的认识，党支部决定立即把部队撒出去，并且作了具体安排，例如把炊事班的同志派到三家饭店去，把文书、司号员、通信员、卫生员派到县医院、中学和村镇去，把战士派到机关、工厂、农村去，等等。
    党支部的决定，得到全连同志的热烈拥护。干部战士背上装满革命宝书的挂包，手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，带上毛主席的最新指示，心中怀着对毛主席的无限热爱、无限忠诚，满怀信心地走上了“三支”“两军”第一线。
      相信群众，依靠群众，用伟大的
  毛泽东思想引导战士在游泳中学会游泳
    连队人员全面铺开了。战士们热情很高，党支部几乎每天都收到报告大好形势的喜讯。但是，也有的战士在工作中碰到一点问题，就打电话要领导出主意，有的还写信说自己没经验，要求派干部去加强领导。在这种情况下，有的干部又不放心了，主张“缩短战线”，“口不要张得太大”，有的提议抽调干部去加强领导。
    怎么办？在支委会上，我们带着这些问题学习了毛主席的教导，学习了林彪副主席的指示。毛主席说：
  “从战争学习战争——这是我们的主要方法。”“革命战争是民众的事，常常不是先学好了再干，而是干起来再学习，干就是学习。”林副主席说：“人民群众掌握了毛泽东思想，就变得最聪明，最勇敢，就能发挥无穷无尽的力量！”毛主席的伟大教导，林副主席的指示，使我们的思想豁然开朗。我们坚信，只要不断地用毛泽东思想武装战士的头脑，用毛主席的最新指示指导战士的实践，战士们就能在错综复杂的阶级斗争中，站得高，看得远，辨得明，办法多，就能在游泳中学会游泳。
    从这以后，党支部的成员不再消极地考虑如何“缩短战线”“调换人员”的问题了，而是积极研究：如何针对着每个战士所处的不同情况，引导他们活学活用毛泽东思想，引导他们按照毛主席的最新指示办事，从斗争实践中增长才能。
    到安福县印刷厂支左的新战士李建军，碰到问题就打电话要领导上想办法。支委会研究后认为，战士碰到问题，能够及时请示报告，这是对的，但是，也反映这个同志还缺乏按照毛主席的最新指示去处理问题的胆略。必须启发他，只要坚决按照毛主席的指示办事，就没有解决不了的问题，就没有克服不了的困难。有一次，李建军打回电话请示说，厂里“杀”出来了革命派，是支持还是不支持？党支部书记曹祖森接到电话，没有急于向他表态，而是针对他的活思想，同他一起学习了林副主席的指示：“这次无产阶级文化大革命，最高司令是我们毛主席。毛主席是统帅。我们在伟大统帅的指挥下，好好地听我们统帅——毛主席的话，文化大革命一定能顺利发展，一定能取得伟大胜利！”然后鼓励他说：工作上要大胆，凡是符合毛泽东思想的事就大干特干！李建军受到了很大的启发，他带着问题学习了毛主席关于“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”和“要保护左派，支持左派，建立和扩大左派队伍”的最新指示，心里豁然开朗，他暗暗对自己说，对！毛主席的巨手往那里指，我就往那里行，毛主席怎么说，我就怎么做。坚决按照最高统帅毛主席的指示办事，就是一个左派我也坚决支持。他立即表态支持了印刷厂的无产阶级革命派，迅速发展壮大了厂里的左派队伍。
    就是这样，我们连的广大战士，在毛泽东思想的指引下，在斗争实践中，得到了锻炼，提高了两条路线斗争的觉悟，学到了在无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的本领。
      相信群众，依靠群众，用群众自己
  总结出来的经验教育群众
    革命在前进，形势在发展。要保证全连干部战士在“三支”“两军”岗位上都能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，帮助广大革命群众奋勇前进，就需要不断介绍和推广先进经验。
    经验从那里来？在支委会上，大家学习了毛主席关于群众路线的教导。毛主席说：“在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”毛主席的教导，使我们认识到，经验来自用毛泽东思想武装起来的在斗争第一线的战士。党支部必须善于总结群众在毛泽东思想指导下，在实践中创造的经验，加以推广，用群众的经验教育群众。
    党支部总结了洲湖公社支左小组的经验。洲湖公社人近三万，除了公社的各个生产队以外，还有县纺织厂、省属建筑队等二十一个企业单位。去执行支左任务的是三个年青的战士：班长陈昌健，战士余天喜、张乾清。他们初到的时候，情况复杂，任务艰巨。那时，这里部分受蒙蔽的群众还没有觉醒，很多干部还没有解放；中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论、“三自一包”等谬论在这里还没有受到有力的批判；夏粮征购任务尚未完成；秋收、冬种又迫在眉睫。这三个忠于毛主席的革命战士，坚信紧跟毛主席就是胜利，他们带着错综复杂的问题，学习了毛主席的最新指示，反复研究领会毛主席的伟大战略部署，认识到：必须把发动群众活学活用毛泽东思想，开展革命大批判摆在首位，只要把大批判搞好了，就抓住了主要矛盾，其它工作就一定能带起来。于是，他们三个人，每天高举毛主席画像，带着毛主席的最新指示，挨家挨户向群众宣传毛泽东思想，揭露中国赫鲁晓夫反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行，组织贫下中农开展革命大批判。不几天，在整个公社就掀起了革命大批判的高潮。通过大批判，社员群众的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟迅速提高，纷纷起来控诉资产阶级反动路线的滔天罪行，社、队的革命干部勇敢地站出来，抓革命，促生产，公社很快建立了临时领导班子，在很短的时间内，夏粮征购任务超额完成，秋收冬种搞得很好，全公社出现了一片欣欣向荣的革命景象。这三个年青战士的体会是：不怕没经验，就怕不实践。只要在毛主席最新指示的指引下认真去实践，那怕是长江天堑那样大的困难，也会“一桥飞架南北，天堑变通途。”
    我们党支部把这三个战士的经验，在全连广泛宣传推广，有力地促进了连队的“三支”“两军”工作。以后，我们又发动在工厂、学校、机关、农村等各个战线上执行“三支”“两军”任务的战士，用伟大统帅毛主席的实践论的观点，大胆实践，认真实践，从实践中总结经验。我们把战士们自己在实践中摸索总结出来的经验和动人事迹，又及时地在全连介绍推广，使大家能够互相学习，互相促进，顺利完成了毛主席交给我们的支左任务。
      相信群众，依靠群众，让广大战士
  把党的密切联系群众的优良作风传下去
    随着全县无产阶级文化大革命的节节胜利，我们党支部又在考虑这样一个问题：必须把相信群众，依靠群众，永远保持党的密切联系群众的优良作风，传给地方的革命干部和革命群众组织负责人，使他们带领广大革命群众紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    我们连炊事班的几个同志在安福饭店支左，一天，我们去检查他们的工作，发现饭店里革命群众组织负责人王时华一天到晚忙忙碌碌，埋头苦干，不注意发动群众，自己累病了，群众还有意见。我们抓住了这件事，和炊事班的同志一起学习了毛主席“我们共产党人好比种子，人民好比土地。我们到了一个地方，就要同那里的人民结合起来，在人民中间生根、开花”和毛主席有关群众路线的教导，并告诉他们在支左工作中，是抱着临时观点支一段呢，还是从长远观点出发，树榜样，传作风，留下一个永远不走的毛泽东思想宣传队？这也是检验我们支左工作好不好的一个重要标志。
    炊事班的同志在党支部的教育帮助下，决心在支左工作中，传作风，树榜样，把坚决贯彻执行毛主席革命路线的革命精神留下来。炊事班长蔡志华和饭店革命群众组织负责人王时华结成“一对红”。蔡志华针对王时华有事不善于发动群众的缺点，和她一起学习毛主席有关群众路线的教导。在实际工作中，蔡志华还处处以身作则，帮助王时华学会运用群众路线的工作方法。王时华在炊事班长的耐心帮助下，群众观点有了很大增强，有事就同群众商量，处处依靠群众，工作有了很大的进步。炊事班的同志还把自己无限热爱毛主席的深厚阶级感情和部队做思想政治工作的优良传统带进了饭店，帮助革命职工建立起“天天读”等制度，积极开展谈心活动和“一帮一、一对红”活动，使饭店的革命职工学习毛主席著作蔚然成风。后来，炊事班的同志离开了安福饭店，安福饭店的革命职工紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，革命和生产都搞得很好。我们及时推广了炊事班同志的这一经验，使
  “三支”“两军”工作有了新的发展。
    伟大领袖毛主席发出大办学习班的伟大号召以后，我们认为，这是普及毛泽东思想，让毛泽东思想在安福县世世代代扎根的重要途径。我们首先和几个战士，到县领导机关办起了毛泽东思想学习班。使革命群众加深了对毛主席最新指示的理解，总结了执行毛主席最新指示的经验。我们及时推广了县领导机关执行毛主席的最新指示，办好毛泽东思想学习班的经验，很快在全县掀起了大办毛泽东思想学习班的高潮。机关办，街道办，学校办，工矿企业办，农村人民公社也办，培养了大批学习毛主席著作的辅导员，播下了红色的种子，为全县掀起更加广泛地活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动打下了良好的基础。
