The Colombian revolutionary guerrilla forces are growing stronger in battle. The official newspaper of the Communist Party of Colombia (Marxist-Leninist) points out that the revolutionary people of Colombia are rising up to oppose U.S. imperialism and the domestic reactionaries.

	BEIJING, June 8 -- BOGOTA, Colombia -- In the northwestern region of Alto Sinu, Colombia, peasants have risen up in rebellion and formed a guerrilla force that includes workers and students. This guerrilla force has, since the beginning of this year, continuously struck against the reactionary Colombian military that oppresses the people, suppressed the heinous landlords, and bravely fought against the pro-American dictatorial regime.

	According to a communiqué issued by the guerrilla force, in several recent battles, this guerrilla force killed and wounded forty government soldiers. The guerrilla force seized weapons from the enemy to arm themselves and the local people, striking back against the reactionary elements who oppress the masses, and gaining the support of the broad masses of the local people. It is reported that on January 6 of this year, the guerrilla force attacked the police station in Ure, a town in the southern part of Cordoba Province, and suppressed a bloodthirsty landlord in that town. This landlord had seized the land of several hundred peasants and killed dozens of peasants. In February, the guerrilla force attacked a reactionary government agency in El Cerro, San Jorge City, killing four policemen and seizing a large number of weapons and equipment. On May 28, this guerrilla force ambushed a government military patrol near Montelibano City in Cordoba Province.

	The Alto Sinu region is located at the border of Antioquia Province and Cordoba Province. The revolutionary people of the region, in order to oppose the pro-American dictatorial government's treacherous policies and reactionary measures that suppress the people, organized the "Alto Sinu and Alto San Jorge Patriotic Committee." This committee issued a statement in January of this year pointing out that the Colombian reactionary government serves U.S. imperialism and the oligarchic forces, plundering the property and land of the Colombian people, and suppressing and massacring the people, which forces the peasants to take up arms and rise up in resistance.

	The statement exposed that at the beginning of this year, a U.S. military mission secretly went to Colombia to "study the situation" and provide reactionary experience in suppressing the peasants.

	The statement called on all the peasants in the northwest to organize and fight to the end against the reactionaries.

	The official newspaper of the Communist Party of Colombia (Marxist-Leninist), "Revolutionary News," recently published an article enthusiastically praising the birth of this guerrilla force. The newspaper pointed out that the revolutionary people of the Alto Sinu region, under the brilliant guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, are rising up to fight for their country and to liberate Colombia from the oppression of the American imperialists and the brutal exploiters.

    哥共（马列）机关报指出哥革命人民正在奋起反对美帝和国内反动派
    新华社八日讯　波哥大消息：哥伦比亚西北部阿尔托西努地区的农民举行起义，组成了一支有工人和学生参加的游击队。这支游击队，今年以来连续打击残害人民的哥伦比亚反动军队，镇压罪大恶极的庄园主，向亲美独裁政权展开了英勇的斗争。
    据游击队发表的公报宣布，在不久前的几次战斗中，这支游击队共打死打伤政府军四十人。游击队夺取了敌人的武器来武装自己和当地的老百姓，打击欺压群众的反动分子，得到当地广大人民的支持。据报道，今年一月六日，游击队袭击了科尔多瓦省南部乌雷镇的警察所，并且镇压了这个镇上的一个血债累累的大庄园主。这个庄园主霸占了几百个农民的土地，杀害了几十个农民。二月间，游击队袭击了圣豪尔赫市埃尔塞罗的一个反动政府机关，打死四名警察，夺得了大批武器和装备。五月二十八日，这支游击队又在科尔多瓦省蒙特利瓦诺市附近，伏击了一支政府军的巡逻队。
    阿尔托西努地区位于安蒂奥基亚省和科尔多瓦省交界处。当地革命人民为了反对亲美独裁政府的卖国政策和镇压人民的反动措施，组织了“阿尔托西努和阿尔托圣豪尔赫爱国委员会”。这个委员会在今年一月发表声明指出，哥伦比亚反动政府为美帝国主义和寡头势力效劳，掠夺哥伦比亚人民的财产和土地，镇压与屠杀人民，这就迫使农民武装起来，奋起反抗。
    声明揭露说，今年年初曾经有一个美国军事使团秘密去哥伦比亚“研究形势”和提供镇压农民的反动经验。
    声明号召所有西北部的农民组织起来，同反动派斗争到底。
    哥伦比亚共产党（马克思列宁主义）机关报《革命报》最近发表文章，热烈赞扬这支游击队的诞生。报纸指出，阿尔托西努地区的革命人民在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的光辉指引下，正在为祖国、为使哥伦比亚摆脱美国佬和残暴的剥削者的压迫而奋起斗争。（附图片）
