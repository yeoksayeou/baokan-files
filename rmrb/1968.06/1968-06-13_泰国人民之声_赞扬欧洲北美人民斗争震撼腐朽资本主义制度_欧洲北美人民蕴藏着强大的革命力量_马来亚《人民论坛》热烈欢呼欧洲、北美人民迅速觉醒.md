	“Voice of the Thai People” radio station commented on June 10 that the ongoing revolutionary movements in France and various European and North American countries are shaking the decaying monopoly capitalist system and driving the wheel of history forward.

	The commentary said, Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the world revolutionary people, pointed out: “The proletariat and laboring people of Europe, North America, and Oceania are in a new awakening.” The revolutionary movements that have erupted in France and various European and North American countries demonstrate the new awakening, new level of struggle, and the immense revolutionary power of the people in these countries.

	The commentary pointed out that in this struggle, workers, peasants, and young students have clearly directed their struggle against the monopoly capitalist reactionary ruling clique, raising clear political slogans. They support and assist each other. This marks a new height in the revolutionary struggle of the European and North American people.

	The commentary said that in the face of the powerful revolutionary movement of the masses, the monopoly capitalist reactionary ruling clique and the modern revisionist group centered around the Soviet revisionist leadership are in a state of panic, fully exposing their paper tiger nature and traitorous faces. The reactionary ruling clique attempts to extinguish the flames of the people's revolution with violence and political deception. The modern revisionist group serves as a henchman, aiding the reactionary ruling clique. They slander, insult, and attack the people's revolutionary movement, closely collaborating with the reactionary ruling clique in political deception plots, attempting to sabotage the people's revolutionary movement.

	The commentary said that the revolutionary movements in France and various European and North American countries are part of the world revolution. These struggles greatly inspire and support the revolutionary struggle of the Thai people. The Thai people resolutely stand on the side of the revolutionary people of France and various European and North American countries, fully supporting their revolutionary struggles.

	The commentary emphasized that no matter how the monopoly capitalist reactionary ruling clique and the modern revisionist group struggle desperately, they cannot stop or sabotage the people's revolutionary movement, nor can they stop the wheel of history from moving forward. As Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out: “No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the wheel of history from moving forward, revolution will inevitably occur, and it will certainly be victorious.”

	According to a June 10 report by Xinhua News Agency, a Singapore message: The Malay newspaper "People's Forum" published in Singapore recently published an article, warmly hailing the just struggle of the people in Western Europe and North America.

	The article said: The broad masses of laborers and intellectuals in Western Europe and North America are rapidly awakening. They have abandoned passive struggle methods such as sitting still and peaceful petitions, taking revolutionary steps such as occupying factories, mines, and schools. They bravely challenge the reactionary state machine, using violence to resist the reactionaries' violent suppression. This is a huge leap in the people's movement in the capitalist world.

	The article said: The surge in the just struggles of the people in Western Europe and North America also declares the bankruptcy of the modern revisionist traitors centered around the Soviet revisionist clique. The people of France, Italy, Spain, and other countries are increasingly recognizing that the revisionists in these countries are friends of the people's enemies and active accomplices of the reactionaries in various countries.

    “泰国人民之声”赞扬欧洲北美人民斗争震撼腐朽资本主义制度
    欧洲北美人民蕴藏着强大的革命力量
    马来亚《人民论坛》热烈欢呼欧洲、北美人民迅速觉醒
    新华社十二日讯  “泰国人民之声”电台十日发表评论指出，正在持续发展的法国和欧洲、北美各国人民的革命运动，震撼着腐朽没落的垄断资本主义制度，推动历史车轮滚滚向前。
    评论说，世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席指出：“欧洲、北美和大洋洲的无产阶级和劳动人民，正处在新的觉醒之中。”这次在法国和欧洲、北美各国爆发的人民革命运动显示着这些国家的人民的新觉醒、新的斗争水平和蕴藏着强大的革命力量。
    评论指出，在这次斗争中，工人、农民和青年学生明确地把斗争的矛头直接指向垄断资本反动统治集团，提出鲜明的政治斗争口号。他们互相配合，互相支援。这标志着欧洲、北美人民的革命斗争已经发展到了一个新的高度。
    评论说，在人民群众强大的革命运动面前，垄断资本反动统治集团和以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义惊慌失措，充分暴露了它们的纸老虎本质和叛徒面目。反动统治集团妄图以暴力镇压和政治欺骗的两手来扑灭人民革命烈火。现代修正主义集团卖力充当帮凶，为反动统治集团效劳。它们污蔑、谩骂、攻击人民革命运动，密切配合反动统治集团玩弄政治欺骗阴谋，妄图破坏人民革命运动。
    评论说，法国和欧洲、北美各国人民的革命运动是世界革命的一个组成部分，这些斗争大大地鼓舞和支援了泰国人民的革命斗争。泰国人民坚决站在法国和欧洲、北美各国革命人民一边，全力支持他们的革命斗争。
    评论强调指出：不管垄断资本反动统治集团和现代修正主义集团怎样垂死挣扎，都无法阻挡和破坏人民的革命运动，无法阻止历史车轮前进。这正如毛泽东主席所指出的：“不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”
    据新华社十日讯　新加坡消息：在新加坡出版的马来亚报纸《人民论坛》最近发表文章，热烈欢呼西欧、北美人民的正义斗争。
    文章说：广大的西欧、北美劳动人民和知识分子正在迅速觉醒。他们放弃了静坐、和平请愿等消极的斗争方式，采取了占领工厂、矿山，占领学校等革命性的步骤。他们勇敢地向反动的国家机器挑战，以暴力反抗反动派的暴力镇压。这是资本主义世界人民运动一个巨大飞跃。
    文章说：西欧、北美的人民正义斗争的高涨，也宣告了以苏修叛徒集团为中心的修正主义叛徒的破产。法国、意大利、西班牙等国家的人民，越来越清楚地认识到这些国家的修正主义者是各国人民的敌人的朋友，是各国反动派的积极帮凶。
