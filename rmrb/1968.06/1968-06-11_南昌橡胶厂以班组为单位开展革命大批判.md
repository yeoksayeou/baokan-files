The Nanchang Rubber Factory, with work teams as the unit, is carrying out a revolutionary criticism and denunciation campaign to thoroughly purge the poison spread by the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev. This has raised the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad masses of workers, exposed a handful of hidden traitors, spies, and class enemies, and timely smashed their evil plots to sabotage the revolution and production, thus powerfully promoting production.

A Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Nanchang dated June 10 reports: The revolutionary masses and revolutionary workers of the Nanchang Rubber Factory, with production work teams as the unit, are carrying out a revolutionary criticism and denunciation campaign. This ensures that the revolutionary criticism and denunciation campaign is carried out deeply and persistently, achieving double victories in revolution and production.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses of the Nanchang Rubber Factory carried out a revolutionary criticism and denunciation campaign against the anti-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party in managing enterprises. After the revolutionary committee of the factory was established at the end of March this year, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching that "revolutionary war is the people's war, only by mobilizing the masses can we wage war, only by relying on the masses can we wage war," it was decided to mobilize the masses more broadly, focusing on work teams as the unit, to carry the revolutionary criticism and denunciation campaign deeper and more persistently, to wage a people's war of revolutionary criticism and denunciation, and thoroughly purge the poison spread by China's Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. They believe that the work team is the most basic level of the factory, familiar with the situation of the masses, strong in combat effectiveness, and a good place to carry out revolutionary criticism and denunciation. The revolutionary committee also promoted the experience of the fourth workshop in carrying out revolutionary criticism and denunciation with work teams as the unit and achieving remarkable results. Thus, a wave of revolutionary criticism and denunciation with work teams as the unit quickly formed throughout the factory.

Workers in various work teams, during the revolutionary criticism and denunciation campaign, harboring deep hatred for China's Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, and harboring profound proletarian feelings of love for the great leader Chairman Mao, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, and strive to be revolutionary critics, making the revolutionary criticism and denunciation campaign flourish. The entire factory has more than 130 work teams, each work team being a combat organization. Active elements and team leaders among the revolutionary workers closely cooperate to form a leadership core, strengthening the leadership of the revolutionary criticism and denunciation campaign. Various work teams, based on the different cultural levels and production tasks of revolutionary workers within the teams, generally adopt the method of combining those with high cultural levels with those with low cultural levels, combining old workers with young workers, and combining study and discussion with struggle and criticism, learning from each other's strengths and weaknesses, and promoting the deepening of the revolutionary criticism and denunciation campaign. Revolutionary workers in various work teams, whenever they carry out a task, select a segment of Chairman Mao's important statements, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, criticizing a reactionary revisionist fallacy of China's Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, purging a stream of their poison. At the same time, they fully utilize big-character posters, blackboard newspapers, special columns for criticism and denunciation, cartoons, and holding criticism meetings and other forms to thoroughly expose and criticize the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party in attempting to restore capitalism. This way, the momentum is strong, the criticism is deep and thorough, making a handful of class enemies completely fall into the vast ocean of the people's war.

The revolutionary committee of the Nanchang Rubber Factory attaches great importance to carrying out revolutionary criticism and denunciation with work teams as the unit, continuously taking measures, summarizing experiences, and strengthening the leadership of the work team's revolutionary criticism and denunciation. Members of the revolutionary committee often go deep into the work teams to inspect and supervise, hold various symposiums, widely solicit the opinions and suggestions of revolutionary workers, and take effective measures in a timely manner to promote the development of the work team's revolutionary criticism and denunciation. At the same time, the revolutionary committee, through the establishment of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, has trained a batch of backbone forces for carrying out revolutionary criticism and denunciation for various work teams. This batch of active elements accounts for about one-sixth of the total number of people in various work teams, and they have fully played the role of backbone forces within the work teams. The revolutionary committee also adopts the method of setting up models and leading by example to lead, often summarizing and promoting the experiences of some advanced work teams in carrying out revolutionary criticism and denunciation. For example, the work teams of the sixth workshop first held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to carry out revolutionary criticism and denunciation in the study classes, making the revolutionary criticism and denunciation lively and colorful. The factory revolutionary committee promptly promoted their experience throughout the factory, pushing the revolutionary criticism and denunciation of the entire factory forward again.

The Nanchang Rubber Factory's carrying out of revolutionary criticism and denunciation with work teams as the unit has further mobilized the masses, effectively raising the class consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary workers. Various work teams in the entire factory have a group of old workers who suffered deep exploitation and oppression in the old society. They actively participate in revolutionary criticism and denunciation in the work teams, speaking out enthusiastically, using their personal experiences to angrily denounce the crimes of China's Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. Some workers with heavy household chores also eagerly joined the revolutionary criticism and denunciation. Old worker Xiong Jinbao of the fourth workshop, with a low cultural level, did not dare to speak out boldly at large meetings in the past, but now actively participates in the revolutionary criticism and denunciation activities of the work team and asks his children to help him write criticism articles at home. Old worker Xu Liangwu of the assembly head group thinks about revolutionary criticism and denunciation even when sleeping at night, getting up from bed in the middle of the night to write articles criticizing China's Khrushchev. The revolutionary workers of various work teams in this factory, while carrying out revolutionary criticism and denunciation, also exposed a handful of hidden spies, traitors, and Japanese puppet collaborators and Han traitors, and timely smashed their evil plots to sabotage the revolution and production.

The result of the Nanchang Rubber Factory's deep and persistent carrying out of revolutionary criticism and denunciation is that the workers' spiritual outlook has been completely renewed, powerfully promoting the development of production. The entire factory's tire production, with an average daily output in April increasing by 44.4% compared to March, rubber shoe production increasing by 12.6%, and the daily output of some products creating a new record in the history of the factory. Production in May also saw a significant increase.

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派的流毒
    南昌橡胶厂以班组为单位开展革命大批判
    广大职工的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟进一步提高，挖出了一小撮隐藏的叛徒、特务等阶级敌人，及时粉碎了他们阴谋破坏革命和生产的罪恶勾当，有力地推动了生产
    新华社南昌十日电　南昌橡胶厂无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，以生产班组为单位开展革命大批判，保证了革命大批判深入持久地开展，取得了革命和生产的双胜利。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，南昌橡胶厂的无产阶级革命派对中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派在办企业方面的反革命修正主义路线进行过革命的大批判。今年三月底厂革命委员会成立后，遵循伟大领袖毛主席“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争”的教导，决定要更加广泛地发动群众，着重以班组为单位，把革命大批判更加深入持久地开展下去，打一场革命大批判的“人民战争”，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派所散布的流毒。他们认为，班组是工厂的最基层，群众情况熟悉，战斗力强，是开展革命大批判的好场所。革委会同时推广了四车间以班组为单位开展革命大批判取得显著成绩的经验。这样，一个以班组为单位开展革命大批判的热潮很快就在全厂形成了。
    各班组革命职工在革命大批判中，怀着对中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派的无比仇恨，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的深厚无产阶级感情，发扬无产阶级革命精神，人人争做革命批判家，使革命大批判开展得如火如荼。全厂一百三十多个班组，每个班组就是一个战斗组织。革命职工中的积极分子和班组长密切合作，组成领导核心，加强对革命大批判的领导。各班组还根据班组内革命职工文化程度高低不同、生产任务不同等特点，普遍采取文化水平高的和文化水平低的结合，老工人和青年工人结合，学习讨论和批判斗争结合的“三结合”办法，互相取长补短，推动革命大批判的深入开展。各班组革命职工每进行一项工作，都选学毛主席一段重要论述，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，批判中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派的一个反革命修正主义谬论，肃清他们的一股流毒。同时充分运用大字报、黑板报、大批判专栏、漫画和召开批判会等形式，狠揭狠批中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。这样做，声势大，批得深，批得透，使一小撮阶级敌人完全陷入“人民战争”的汪洋大海之中。
    南昌橡胶厂革命委员会对以班组为单位开展革命大批判十分重视，不断采取措施，总结经验，加强对班组革命大批判的领导。革委会成员经常深入班组督促检查，召开各种座谈会，广泛征求革命职工的意见和建议，及时采取有效措施，推动班组革命大批判的开展。同时，革委会通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，为各班组训练了一批开展革命大批判的骨干力量，这批积极分子约占各班组总人数的六分之一，他们在班组内充分发挥了骨干作用。革委会还采取树典型、以点带面的领导方法，经常总结和推广一些先进班组开展革命大批判的经验。例如，六车间各班组首先举办毛泽东思想学习班，在学习班上以毛泽东思想为武器开展革命的大批判，使革命大批判搞得有声有色。厂革委会及时向全厂推广了他们的经验，把全厂的革命大批判又向前推进了一步。
    南昌橡胶厂以班组为单位开展革命大批判，进一步发动了群众，有效地提高了广大革命职工的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟。全厂各班组都有一批老工人，在旧社会深受剥削和压迫，他们在班组积极参加革命大批判，争先恐后发言，以亲身经历，愤怒控诉中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派的罪行。一些家务多的职工，也都踊跃投入了革命大批判。四车间老工人熊金保，文化水平低，过去在大会上不敢大胆发言，现在积极参加班组革命大批判活动，回家还让子女帮助他写批判文章。装头小组老工人许良武，晚上睡觉也惦念着革命大批判，半夜从床上爬起来写文章批判中国赫鲁晓夫。这个厂各班组革命职工在开展革命大批判中，还挖出了一小撮隐藏的特务、叛徒、日伪汉奸等阶级敌人，及时粉碎了他们阴谋破坏革命和生产的罪恶勾当。
    南昌橡胶厂深入持久地开展革命大批判的结果，职工们精神面貌焕然一新，有力地推动了生产的发展。全厂轮胎生产，四月份平均日产量比三月份上升百分之四十四点四，胶鞋生产上升百分之十二点六，个别产品日产量创造本厂有史以来的最新纪录。五月份生产又有很大提高。
