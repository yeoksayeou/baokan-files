The sixth session of the sixth People's Assembly of Albania was held in Tirana on June 24th and 25th.

The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania, Comrade Enver Hoxha, Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Assembly, Comrade Haxhi Lleshi, and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Comrade Mehmet Shehu, and other party and state leaders attended the meeting.

The meeting heard and discussed the report made by Marko, Vice Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Assembly, on behalf of the Presidium of the People's Assembly. The meeting unanimously passed the amendments to Articles 79 and 85 of the Constitution, stipulating that the Supreme People's Court and the District People's Courts are the main components of the people's courts, abolishing the people's courts at the level of large administrative regions. The meeting also passed the new court organization ordinance.

In his report to the meeting, the President of the Supreme People's Court, Qerim Çela, pointed out that the new court organization ordinance, which absorbs the broader participation of the working people in judicial work, is a new step against bureaucratism and helps to further revolutionize the work of the Albanian socialist courts.

The meeting also passed the ordinance on "copyright" based on the initiative of the masses for revolutionization, and passed the new ordinance on the protection, development, and rational exploitation of forests.

The meeting also approved several ordinances issued by the Presidium since the last meeting.
