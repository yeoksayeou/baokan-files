The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the key question for the revolution." The revolutionary committee of the Wood Material Hydrolysis Factory in Yichun City, Heilongjiang Province, never forgets Chairman Mao's great teachings. In leading the broad revolutionary masses to launch a fierce attack on the class enemy, they strictly distinguish between two types of contradictions, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, insist on uniting their own class ranks, and strive to unite and win over all revolutionary forces that can be united. This has fundamentally seized the initiative in class struggle.

In February of this year, a handful of class enemies took advantage of the revolutionary committee's open rectification to stir up a counter-revolutionary economic trend and a rightist revisionist wind. Some masses and cadres were also deceived and fell into the trap. At that time, some revolutionary comrades were very indignant and prepared to "rectify" and "struggle" against those who were deceived. Facing this situation, the members of the revolutionary committee discussed with these revolutionary comrades and repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great teachings on correctly handling two types of contradictions, "believing in and relying on the masses," and "believing in and relying on the majority of the cadres." Everyone deeply realized: Always remember to distinguish between friends and enemies, unite the majority, isolate a handful, be ruthless to the enemy, and be gentle to our own people. This is Chairman Mao's consistent teaching and an important guarantee for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. After we proletarian revolutionaries seize power, we must oppose both the rightist tendency of confusing enemies with friends and the ultra-"left" tendency of confusing friends with enemies. We must always direct the spearhead of the struggle at a handful of class enemies. Whether or not we pay attention to distinguishing between friends and enemies in the struggle and correctly handle the masses and cadres who have been deceived and made mistakes is a fundamental attitude of loyalty to Chairman Mao.

After studying, everyone raised their awareness and, in the struggle, paid attention to strictly distinguishing between two types of contradictions. On one hand, they took the initiative to launch a resolute attack on the class enemies; on the other hand, they distinguished between the class enemies who stirred up the rightist revisionist wind and the deceived masses and cadres; they distinguished between the leaders of mass organizations who made mistakes and a handful of bad elements who infiltrated the mass organizations; they distinguished between cadres who made serious mistakes and unrepentant capitalist roaders. For the deceived masses and cadres, they insisted on starting from ideological education, through revolutionary criticism, through exposing the class struggle cover, and through individual heart-to-heart talks, to help them raise their class struggle and line struggle awareness and return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The leaders of the factory revolutionary committee had several heart-to-heart talks with a few leaders of mass organizations who made mistakes, speaking earnestly to help them, warning them to be vigilant and not to be fooled by the class enemies. They finally raised their awareness and admitted their mistakes. Some workers in the Timber Processing Workshop were deceived by bad elements on the issue of bonuses and directed their struggle at the revolutionary committee. Through reminiscing about bitterness and sweetness and carrying out a deep criticism of the revisionist fallacies of "money as the commander" and "material incentives" promoted by Chinese Khrushchev, these workers quickly raised their awareness. They exposed on the spot a landlord element who had not been reformed and was fanning the flames from behind the scenes.

    团结大多数  打击一小撮
    古田路  南卫东
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”黑龙江省伊春市木材水解厂革命委员会，念念不忘毛主席的伟大教导，在带领广大革命群众向阶级敌人猛烈进攻中，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，坚持团结自己的阶级队伍，争取和团结一切可以团结的革命力量，从根本上掌握了阶级斗争的主动权。
    今年二月，一小撮阶级敌人趁革委会开门整风之际，刮起了一阵反革命经济主义和右倾翻案妖风；部分群众和干部也受了蒙蔽，陷了进去。当时，有些革命同志非常气愤，准备对个别受蒙蔽的人也“整一整，斗一斗”。针对这种情况，革命委员会的成员就和这些革命同志一起，反复学习了毛主席关于正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾、“要相信和依靠群众”、“相信和依靠干部的大多数”等伟大教导。大家深刻地认识到：时刻不忘分清敌友，团结大多数，孤立一小撮，对敌人要狠，对自己人要和，这是毛主席的一贯教导，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的重要保证。我们无产阶级革命派掌权以后，既要反对认敌为友的右倾思想，也要反对视友为敌的极“左”思想，要始终把斗争矛头指向一小撮阶级敌人。是不是注意在斗争中分清敌友，正确地对待受蒙蔽、犯错误的群众和干部，这是对毛主席忠不忠的根本态度问题。
    经过学习，大家提高了认识，在斗争中注意严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，一方面坚决向阶级敌人主动进攻，一方面注意把煽动刮右倾翻案风的阶级敌人同受蒙蔽的群众和干部区别开来；把犯了错误的群众组织的头头同混入群众组织的一小撮坏人区别开来；把犯过严重错误的干部和死不悔改的走资派区别开来。对于受蒙蔽的群众和干部，坚持从思想教育入手，通过革命大批判，通过揭阶级斗争盖子和个别谈心，帮助他们提高阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。厂革委会领导同志三番五次找几个犯了错误的群众组织的头头谈心，语重心长地帮助他们，告诫他们要提高警惕，不要上阶级敌人的当。他们终于提高了认识，承认了错误。制材车间有些工人在对待奖金问题上，上了坏人的当，把斗争矛头指向革命委员会。通过忆苦思甜和开展对中国赫鲁晓夫推行的“金钱挂帅”、“物质刺激”等修正主义谬论的深入批判，这些工人迅速提高了觉悟。他们在批判会上，当场揪出了一个在背后煽阴风、点邪火的没有改造好的地主分子。
