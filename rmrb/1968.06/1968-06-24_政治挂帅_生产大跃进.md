The Chinese Khrushchev shamelessly advocates using material incentives and reward systems to boost the "enthusiasm of the laborers." A few words reveal the soul of this traitor and counter-revolutionary revisionist.

"Without correct political views, one is like a person without a soul." Mao Zedong Thought is an invincible spiritual atomic bomb. Once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it will become a powerful material force for changing heaven and earth. Our factory is newly built. Before the construction, this area was desolate for tens of miles. Our construction committee believed that the more difficult the conditions, the more we must emphasize the study of Chairman Mao's works, especially focusing on applying them in practice. The heavier the tasks, the more we must highlight proletarian politics; the tighter the schedule, the more we must grasp the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works. We use Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, making the workers, though living in the mountains, have a global vision, dedicating themselves to the revolution, and displaying a revolutionary spirit of hard struggle. We opened mountains, built roads, and bridged rivers. Not knowing how to build roads, the workers, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, liberated their minds, conducted their own surveys, and designed their own plans. With politics in the lead, production made great leaps, continuously exceeding production targets. We completed the construction of a modern factory in just eleven months, efficiently and economically completing the construction task. More importantly, the Party members and workers have a new spirit, everyone cares about national affairs, and a workforce loyal to Chairman Mao, with Party members as the backbone, has been cultivated.

Facts tell us: Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of our economic work. The fundamental task of our Party organization is to always highlight proletarian politics, use Mao Zedong Thought to educate the workers, promote the revolutionization of people's thinking, and use politics to guide business and technology. The Chinese Khrushchev wants us to pursue money as the leader, "material incentives." This is to lead us down the black road of revisionism, which will never be allowed!

    政治挂帅　生产大跃进
    李文华
    中国的赫鲁晓夫无耻地叫嚷，要用物质刺激、奖励制度去提高“劳动者的积极性”。寥寥几语，道出了这个大叛徒和反革命修正主义分子的灵魂。
      “没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”毛泽东思想是威力无比的精神原子弹。毛泽东思想一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改天换地的强大物质力量。我们工厂是新建的，建厂前，这里几十里荒无人烟。我们筹建处党委认为，越是在艰苦困难的条件下，越是要狠抓党员和职工的毛主席著作学习，特别要在用字上狠下功夫。任务越重越要突出无产阶级政治，时间越紧越要抓活学活用毛主席著作。我们用毛泽东思想统帅一切，使广大职工身居山沟，胸怀世界，一心为革命，发扬艰苦奋斗的革命硬骨头精神，开山劈岭，筑路架桥。不懂修公路技术，广大职工在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，解放思想，自己勘测，自己设计。政治领先，生产大飞跃，不断地超额完成生产任务。我们仅用了十一个月，建成了一座现代化工厂，多快好省地完成了筹建任务，更重要的是，党员和职工精神面貌焕然一新，人人关心国家大事，培养了一支以党员为骨干的无限忠于毛主席的职工队伍。
    事实告诉我们：毛泽东思想是我们经济工作的生命线。我们党组织的根本任务，就是要永远突出无产阶级政治，用毛泽东思想去教育职工，促进人的思想革命化，用政治统帅业务、技术。而中国赫鲁晓夫要我们去搞金钱挂帅，“物质刺激”，这是要把我们引向修正主义黑路，这永远办不到！
