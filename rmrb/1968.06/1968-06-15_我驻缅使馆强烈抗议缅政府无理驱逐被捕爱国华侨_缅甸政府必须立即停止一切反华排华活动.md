	The Chinese Embassy in Burma has strongly protested the Burmese government's unreasonable announcement to expel detained patriotic overseas Chinese.

	The Burmese government must immediately stop all anti-China and anti-Chinese activities.

	New China News Agency, June 14th: Rangoon news: The Chinese Embassy in Burma sent a note to the Burmese Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 13th, strongly protesting the Burmese government's unreasonable announcement to expel patriotic overseas Chinese who were illegally arrested and to deport them.

	The note said that recently, the Burmese government has repeatedly sent notes to the Chinese Embassy, brazenly announcing the expulsion of Chen Fushun and dozens of other patriotic overseas Chinese who were illegally arrested. This is a serious step taken by the Burmese government in its persistent policy of hostility towards China and its intensified persecution of overseas Chinese.

	The note said that in the anti-China and anti-Chinese incidents instigated by the Burmese government last June, a series of savage massacres and cruel persecutions of overseas Chinese were committed. Subsequently, various absurd pretexts and fabricated evidence were created to arrest a large number of patriotic overseas Chinese, who were then subjected to severe torture and sentenced to heavy penalties, and thrown into prison. Overseas Chinese in prison have suffered various forms of abuse and torture, and even their lives have been seriously threatened. So far, two overseas Chinese have been tortured to death in prison. The Chinese Embassy has repeatedly demanded that the Burmese government immediately release all patriotic overseas Chinese who were illegally arrested and sentenced. However, the Burmese government not only refused to accept this solemn demand but also continued to arrest overseas Chinese in various parts of Burma. Now it has come to announce the expulsion of a large number of illegally arrested overseas Chinese. It is clear that the Burmese government is stubbornly following its preconceived plan to systematically persecute the vast number of patriotic overseas Chinese residing in Burma, completely depriving them of their legitimate and lawful right to exist.

	The note pointed out that the Burmese government's persecution of overseas Chinese, who love their own country and have always been friendly with the Burmese people, is driven by its vile political purposes, which is to cater to the needs of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, further worsening the relations between China and Burma. The arrested and sentenced overseas Chinese are completely innocent. The Burmese government should immediately and unconditionally release them and has no reason to announce their expulsion. The Chinese Embassy firmly rejects the Burmese government's unreasonable demand in its note to expel patriotic overseas Chinese. It must be pointed out that the Burmese government should not think it can arbitrarily and at will persecute overseas Chinese. You will have to settle this account someday.

	The note finally said that the Chinese government resolutely protects the legitimate rights and personal safety of overseas Chinese. The Chinese Embassy once again solemnly demands that the Burmese government immediately release all patriotic overseas Chinese who have been illegally arrested and sentenced in Rangoon and various parts of Burma, immediately stop all anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, and effectively guarantee the personal freedom and safety of overseas Chinese. Otherwise, the Burmese government must bear full responsibility for all consequences that may arise.

    我驻缅使馆强烈抗议缅政府无理驱逐被捕爱国华侨
    缅甸政府必须立即停止一切反华排华活动
    新华社十四日讯　仰光消息：中国驻缅甸大使馆十三日照会缅甸联邦外交部，强烈抗议缅甸政府无理宣布驱逐被非法逮捕的爱国华侨出境。
    照会说，最近，缅甸政府连续照会中国大使馆，悍然宣布驱逐陈福顺等数十名被无理逮捕的爱国华侨出境。这是缅甸政府坚持推行敌视中国的政策，加紧迫害华侨的又一严重步骤。
    照会说，缅甸政府在去年六月挑起的反华排华事件中，制造了一系列野蛮屠杀和残酷迫害华侨的暴行。接着又制造各种荒谬的借口和捏造罪证，先后逮捕了大批爱国华侨，并加以严刑审讯和判处重刑，把他们投入监狱。在狱中的华侨遭到种种虐待和拷打，甚至生命安全受到严重威胁，迄今已有两名华侨被折磨以至惨死狱中。中国大使馆不断要求缅甸政府立即释放所有被无理逮捕和判刑的爱国华侨。但是，缅甸政府不仅拒不接受这一严正要求，而且继续在缅甸各地逮捕华侨，现在却又来照宣布驱逐大批被无理逮捕的华侨出境。很明显，缅甸政府是要顽固地按照它既定的计划，有步骤地迫害旅居缅甸的广大爱国华侨，完全剥夺他们正当合法的生存权利。
    照会指出，缅甸政府对热爱自己的祖国、一向与缅甸人民友好相处的华侨进行迫害，是出于它的卑鄙的政治目的，就是为了迎合美帝和苏修的需要，进一步恶化中缅两国关系。被逮捕和判刑的华侨是完全无辜的。缅甸政府应当立即无条件释放他们，而没有任何理由宣布驱逐他们出境。中国大使馆断然拒绝缅甸政府在来照中就驱逐爱国华侨出境提出的无理要求。必须指出，缅甸政府不要认为它可以肆无忌惮、随心所欲地迫害华侨，你们欠的这笔账，总有一天是要算的。
    照会最后说，中国政府坚决保护华侨的正当权益和人身安全。中国大使馆再次严正要求缅甸政府，立即释放所有在仰光和缅甸各地被无理逮捕和判刑的爱国华侨，立即停止一切反华排华活动，切实保证华侨的人身自由和安全。否则，缅甸政府必须对由此而产生的一切后果，承担全部责任。
