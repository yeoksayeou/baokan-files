In the great situation of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the commercial departments in Shanghai have seen a continuous increase in the procurement and supply of daily industrial goods. In the second quarter of this year, the supply of daily industrial goods to various parts of the country increased by more than 20% compared to the first quarter, effectively supporting industrial production and the national urban and rural markets.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "Revolution is the liberation of productive forces, and revolution is the promotion of the development of productive forces." The proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary workers in the procurement and supply stations of the Shanghai Municipal First Commercial Bureau, who are responsible for the procurement and supply of daily industrial goods, firmly implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." Since this year, the total value of goods procured has increased month by month. The procurement value in May was 16% higher than in April, and since June, it has continued to rise significantly. Among the 63 key commodities closely related to agricultural and industrial production and people's lives, 47 commodities had increased procurement in May compared to April. The procurement of cotton cloth, woolen fabrics, soap, matches, light bulbs, bicycles, watches, pens, penicillin, nails, and iron wire has all exceeded the level of the same period last year. The quality of commodities is continuously improving, and the variety and color of the products are more in line with the needs of the broad laboring masses. Based on the significant increase in procurement, the commercial departments in Shanghai have also greatly increased the supply of daily industrial goods to various parts of the country.

Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, the proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary workers in the procurement and supply stations of the Shanghai Municipal First Commercial Bureau have always adhered to their posts, vigorously grasped the revolution, and promoted production to do a good job in procurement and supply work, smashing the evil plots of the class enemies to sabotage production and the revolution. They regard actively procuring, increasing supply, supporting production, and supporting the national market as an important aspect of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The total procurement value of textiles in May exceeded the level of the same period last year. The procurement and supply station for cultural goods, through learning, established the idea of serving industrial production, went deep into the factories, and timely reflected the demand for cultural goods in various places, effectively promoting production.

The proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary workers in the Shanghai Municipal First Commercial Bureau system firmly remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle," tightly grasp the class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, put revolution in the first place, and use revolution to guide production. They use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, take the handful of class enemies in their system and unit as live targets, and fiercely expose and criticize the "class struggle extinction theory" and the "production first," "profit-oriented," and "material incentive" counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods spread by China's Khrushchev and his agents. In the past, some departments pursued profits in the operation of commodities, prioritizing major commodities over minor ones, and hot-selling items over cold-selling ones. Now, they emphasize proletarian politics, first consider the needs of agricultural and industrial production and the laboring masses, and further direct the operation of commodities towards the countryside and the broad laboring masses. During this period, various procurement and supply stations have organized forces to conduct investigations and visits in the countryside, propagate Mao Zedong Thought, understand the needs of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and some have even brought samples of new trial-produced and trial-sold products to solicit the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants. They timely reflect these opinions to the factories, promoting the production of many economical, practical, and durable new varieties of daily industrial goods, which are welcomed by the laboring masses in various places. The broad revolutionary workers in the commercial system also actively cooperate with the factories to reform the patterns, designs, and trademarks of commodities. Since this year, the patterns, shapes, and designs of many daily industrial goods have propagated Mao Zedong Thought and reflected the thriving situation of socialist revolution and socialist construction.

    把革命放在首位　促进生产向前发展
    上海供应全国的日用工业品大大增加
    有力地支援了工业生产和全国城乡市场
    据新华社上海二十三日电　在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大好形势下，上海商业部门日用工业品采购和供应量节节上升，今年第二季度调拨供应全国各地的日用工业品比第一季度增长百分之二十以上，有力地支援了工业生产和全国城乡市场。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“革命就是解放生产力，革命就是促进生产力的发展。”担负日用工业品采购供应任务的上海市第一商业局系统各采购供应站的无产阶级革命派和革命职工，坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，今年以来收购商品的总值，一月高过一月。五月份比四月份增长百分之十六，六月份以来又继续大幅度上升。与工农业生产、人民生活密切有关的六十三种重点商品中，有四十七种五月份收购量比四月份增加。棉布、呢绒、肥皂、火柴、电灯泡、自行车、手表、钢笔、链霉素、元钉、铁丝等商品的收购量，都超过去年同期水平。商品质量不断提高，花色品种更加适合广大劳动人民需要。在收购数量大幅度增长的基础上，上海商业部门调拨供应全国各地的日用工业品也大大增加。
    无产阶级文化大革命开展以来，上海第一商业局系统各采购供应站的无产阶级革命派和革命职工始终坚守工作岗位，狠抓革命，猛促生产，做好采购供应工作，粉碎阶级敌人破坏生产，破坏革命的罪恶阴谋。他们把积极采购，增加供应，支持生产，支持全国市场，看作是落实毛主席最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的一个重要方面。五月份纺织品的收购总值超过了去年同期的水平。文化用品采购供应站的采购员通过学习，确立了为工业生产服务的思想，深入工厂，及时反映各地对文化用品的需求情况，有力地促进了生产。
    上海市第一商业局系统的无产阶级革命派和革命职工，牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，紧紧抓住阶级斗争和两条路线斗争这个纲，把革命放在首位，以革命统帅生产。他们以毛泽东思想为武器，以本系统、本单位一小撮阶级敌人为活靶子，狠揭狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人散布的“阶级斗争熄灭”论和“生产第一”、“利润挂帅”、“物质刺激”等反革命修正主义黑货。过去有些部门经营商品追求利润，重大商品，轻小商品；重热门货，轻冷门货。现在突出无产阶级政治，首先考虑工农业生产和劳动人民的需要，进一步把商品经营方向面向农村，面向广大劳动人民。这一时期来，各采购供应站普遍组织力量，深入农村调查访问，宣传毛泽东思想，了解贫下中农需要，有的还带着试产试销的新产品样品，征求贫下中农的意见。他们及时把这些意见向工厂反映，推动工厂生产出许多经济实惠、坚固耐用的新品种日用工业品，受到各地劳动人民的欢迎。商业系统广大革命职工还积极配合工厂改革商品的花样、图案和商标。今年以来，许多日用工业品的花样、造型、图案宣传了毛泽东思想，反映了蓬蓬勃勃的社会主义革命和社会主义建设新气象。
