Refuting the Traitorous Logic of "A Moment's Hesitation"

The Five Good Soldier Qi Xingchang

Chairman Mao teaches us: "A change in worldview is a fundamental change." Yet, the Chinese Khrushchev goes on to say that a person "can be revolutionary or counter-revolutionary; the fundamental issue is a matter of thought, 'a moment's hesitation.'" The Chinese Khrushchev creates this fallacy on one hand to exonerate his traitorous clique, and on the other hand, to slander all heroic figures. He deliberately blurs the distinction between the proletarian and bourgeois worldviews, fundamentally denying the necessity and difficulty of our revolutionary soldiers in transforming their worldviews. According to the reactionary logic of the Chinese Khrushchev, a traitor who betrays and surrenders the revolution, selling out the revolution, seems not to be determined by his reactionary stance and the bourgeois worldview of fearing death and loving life, but merely by "a moment's hesitation"; a heroic figure who risks his life to save the lives of the people and the property of the state, seems not to be determined by his proletarian worldview, but merely by a momentary impulse. This is sheer nonsense, utterly reactionary.

A revolutionary soldier armed with Mao Zedong Thought and a disgraceful traitor who betrays the revolution have a fundamental difference in their worldviews, not just "a moment's hesitation." In the face of life-and-death trials at critical moments, it is one's worldview that truly reveals itself. Selflessness leads to fearlessness. Someone filled with bourgeois thoughts, who in ordinary times would not "pluck a single hair to benefit the world," would never stand up when the revolution calls for him to sacrifice his life. Only a revolutionary soldier armed with Mao Zedong Thought can face danger without fear, disregard his own life and death, and bravely stand up to protect the safety of the people's lives and the state's property. The good cadre, Comrade Men He, who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, fully embodies this truth.

Comrade Men He's selfless and heroic deed of sacrificing himself to save others is a concentrated expression of his firm proletarian worldview, not just "a moment's hesitation." Comrade Men He, in the face of an imminent explosion, could rush forward and stand firm, not by chance, but as a result of his twenty years of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. It is the result of his adhering to "studying Chairman Mao's works word by word, remembering Chairman Mao's teachings sentence by sentence, and implementing Chairman Mao's instructions point by point." It is the result of his dedicating "every moment, every second of his life to the people's interests." It is the result of his "thinking of Chairman Mao in everything, obeying Chairman Mao in everything, following Chairman Mao in everything, and doing everything for Chairman Mao." In a word, it is the inevitable result of his firmly establishing a proletarian worldview of "serving the people selflessly." Over the years, Comrade Men He's repeated heroic deeds of sacrificing himself to save others have shone with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, serving as a powerful refutation of the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist fallacy of "a moment's hesitation." It has given the Chinese Khrushchev another resounding slap in the face.

We are determined to take Comrade Men He as a shining example, to work hard on fundamentally transforming our worldviews, and to be revolutionary soldiers who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, just like him, "revolving a lifetime, transforming thoughts a lifetime..."

    斥“一念之差”的叛徒逻辑
    五好战士　祁兴昌
    毛主席教导我们：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。可是，中国赫鲁晓夫却胡说什么，一个人“可以革命，也可以反革命，基本问题是一个想头，‘一念之差’。”中国赫鲁晓夫制造这种谬论，一方面是替他的叛徒集团开脱罪责；另一方面也是对一切英雄人物进行污蔑。他故意抹煞无产阶级和资产阶级两种对立的世界观的区别，从根本上否定我们革命战士改造世界观的必要性和艰巨性。按照中国赫鲁晓夫的这种反动逻辑，一个叛徒叛变自首，出卖革命，似乎不是由于他的反动立场和贪生怕死的资产阶级世界观所决定的，而仅仅是什么“一念之差”；一个英雄人物为了抢救人民生命和国家财产，不惜献出自己的生命，似乎不是他的无产阶级世界观所决定，而不过是一时的冲动。这真是一派胡言，反动透顶。
    一个用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士同出卖革命的可耻叛徒之间的本质区别，在于世界观的根本不同，绝不是什么“一念之差”。在面临着生死考验的千钧一发之际，正是一个人的世界观彻底“亮相”的时候，无私才能无畏。一个充满资产阶级思想，平时“拔一毛而利天下不为”的人，绝不会在革命需要他贡献出自己生命的时候挺身而出。只有用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，才能临危不惧，把自己的生死置之度外，勇敢地起来保护人民生命和国家财产的安全。无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部门合同志，充分实践了这一真理。
    门合同志公而忘私、舍己救人的英雄行为，是他的坚定的无产阶级世界观的集中表现，决不是什么“一念之差”。门合同志在炸药即将爆炸的千钧一发之际，能够冲得上、过得硬，决不是偶然的，这是他二十年来活学活用毛主席著作的结果。是他对“毛主席著作，字字活学活用；毛主席教导，句句牢记心间；毛主席的指示，条条落实照办”的必然结果。是他“一时一刻，一分一秒，生命的全部时间都是为人民利益而工作”的结果。是他“一切想着毛主席，一切服从毛主席，一切紧跟毛主席，一切为着毛主席”的结果。一句话，是他牢固地树立了“毫不利己专门利人”的无产阶级世界观的必然结果。多年来，门合同志一次又一次的舍己救人的英雄行为，闪耀着毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉，是对中国赫鲁晓夫的“一念之差”的修正主义谬论的有力驳斥，它给了中国赫鲁晓夫又一记响亮的耳光。
    我们决心以门合同志为光辉榜样，在彻底改造世界观上狠下功夫，象他那样“干一辈子革命，改造一辈子思想……”，做一个无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席革命路线的无产阶级革命战士。
