Pakistani public opinion condemns the conspiracy of the U.S. and the Soviet Union in concocting the "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons," pointing out that this treaty is a challenge to world peace.

The recent issue of the _Holiday_ weekly from East Pakistan published an article stating that the "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons" concocted by the U.S. and the Soviet Union is nuclear blackmail and the promotion of nuclear colonialism by the major powers against the non-nuclear small countries.

The weekly said, "The 'Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons' is another weapon used by these nuclear powers to issue orders to non-nuclear countries, because this treaty imposes no restrictions or constraints on the U.S. and the Soviet Union themselves, but prevents non-nuclear countries from making defensive arrangements to counter nuclear attacks."

The editorial of the _Leader_ newspaper on the 22nd said, "The 'Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons' makes non-nuclear countries 'not allowed to possess nuclear weapons' and 'completely incapable of retaliating against nuclear aggression.'"

In discussing the so-called United Nations guarantee to provide "nuclear protection" to countries that sign this treaty, the editorial said: "The whole world has little trust in the United Nations. The guarantees proposed in the treaty cannot reassure Pakistan, which is very natural. Pakistan's painful experience with the United Nations is not something that can be easily forgotten."

The editorial of the _Free Press_ on the same day emphasized that, in reality, this "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons" is a challenge to world peace itself.

The editorial of the _New Era_ newspaper recently published in Rawalpindi pointed out that the so-called "nuclear umbrella" provided by the U.S. and the Soviet Union to counter nuclear attacks is not convincing to anyone, because these countries themselves are constantly engaged in large-scale destruction of world peace.

    巴舆论说“防止核扩散条约”是对世界和平的挑战
    谴责美帝苏修推行核殖民主义
    新华社拉瓦尔品第二十六日电　巴基斯坦舆论谴责美苏合伙炮制的“防止核扩散条约”的阴谋，指出这个条约是对世界和平的一个挑战。
    东巴基斯坦《假日》周刊最近一期发表文章说，美苏合伙炮制的“防止核扩散条约”，是大国损害无核小国的核讹诈和推行核殖民主义。
    周刊说，“防止核扩散条约”是这些核国家用来对无核国家发号施令的另一个武器，因为这个条约对美苏自己不加任何约束或限制，而是不准无核国家作出抵抗核袭击的防御安排。
    巴基斯坦《领袖报》二十二日的社论说，“防止核扩散条约”，使无核国家“不得拥有核武器”，“对核侵略毫无还击能力”。
    社论在谈到对签署这个条约的无核国家提供“核保护”的所谓联合国保证时说：“全世界对联合国很不信任，条约里提出的保证不能使巴基斯坦放心，这是很自然的。巴基斯坦从联合国获得的惨痛经历是不能轻易忘掉的。”
    《自由报》同一天的社论强调说，实际上，这个“防止核扩散条约”，是对世界和平本身的一个挑战。
    在拉瓦尔品第出版的《新时代报》最近在社论中指出，美、苏所谓保证提供对付核袭击的“核保护伞”，是不能使任何人信服的，因为这些国家本身总是在大肆破坏世界和平。
