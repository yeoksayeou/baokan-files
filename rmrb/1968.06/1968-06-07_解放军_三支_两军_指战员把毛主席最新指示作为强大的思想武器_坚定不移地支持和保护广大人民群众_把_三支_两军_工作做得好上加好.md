PLA "Three Supports, Two Militaries" cadres use Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a powerful ideological weapon, firmly supporting and protecting the broad masses of the people, and doing the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work better and better.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated June 6, PLA soldiers and officers fighting on the front lines of the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" are deeply moved by the profound proletarian feelings. They swiftly and thoroughly study and implement the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship." The broad masses of soldiers and officers have written down Chairman Mao's latest instructions in their notebooks, memorized them word for word, and made them their guiding principles. They unanimously pointed out that Chairman Mao's latest instructions provide a powerful ideological weapon for us to further do a good job in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work. The PLA is united and fights for the interests of the broad masses of the people. We must take Comrade Lei Feng as an example, resolutely implement and carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions, always believe in and rely on the masses of the people, always be one with the masses of the people, always be heart to heart with the masses of the people, always fight to protect the interests of the masses of the people, resolutely implement and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, do the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work better and better, and in the great struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, create new merits for the people.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the creation of world history." Soldiers and officers fighting on the front lines of the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" across the country, combined with their practical struggles, deeply feel that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the beacon guiding us to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, and the fundamental policy guiding us to complete the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" tasks. Soldiers and officers of the Nanjing Army's "Linfeng Brigade" said, the great leader Chairman Mao personally created the PLA and set its sole purpose as "standing firmly with the Chinese people and serving them wholeheartedly." The PLA has always stood and fought together with the masses of the people, providing them with tremendous support. At this critical moment of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, only by following Chairman Mao's great teachings, firmly believing in and relying on the masses, supporting and protecting the masses, and respecting the revolutionary initiative of the masses, can we carry this political revolution to the end. Soldiers and officers of the Zizhong People's Armed Forces Department in Sichuan Province, known as the "Red Flag for Supporting the Left," excitedly said, under Chairman Mao's great teachings of "the PLA should support the broad leftist masses," we have united and fought together with the broad leftist masses, achieving great victories. We must further arm ourselves with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, take Comrade Lei Feng as an example, cherish the masses everywhere, always put the interests of the masses first, and together with the broad masses, achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must stand on the side of the masses of the people, and never stand on the side of the people's enemies. This is a fundamental issue of stance for a Marxist-Leninist." Soldiers and officers carrying out the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" tasks, after studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, deeply feel that whether to protect or suppress the masses of the people is the fundamental mark distinguishing the people's army from all reactionary armies. They said, the work of supporting the left has countless principles, but the first and foremost is to arm the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, firmly and unshakably support and protect the revolutionary masses, and accurately and decisively strike at a handful of class enemies. Only by believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and uniting all revolutionary forces to form a vast revolutionary army, can we make a handful of class enemies completely sink into the vast ocean of the people's war. Soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the PLA executing the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" tasks in the Yichun Forest Area of Heilongjiang Province, combined with their own struggles, said, after the establishment of the Yichun Revolutionary Committee, the class enemies, unwilling to admit defeat, used counter-revolutionary two-faced tactics to incite a part of the deceived masses to direct their spears at the Revolutionary Committee, attempting to overthrow the newly born Revolutionary Committee and carry out a counter-revolutionary restoration. Our supporting-left troops helped the Revolutionary Committee do thorough and detailed ideological and political work among the deceived masses, making them wake up one after another and actively join the great struggle of revolutionary criticism, smashing the class enemies' fierce attacks. Soldiers and officers of the East China Sea Fleet executing military training tasks in a Shanghai school said, experience has proven that as long as we firmly stand on the side of the revolutionary masses, mobilize the masses, and tightly rely on the masses, the struggle will definitely be victorious. In the struggle to launch a fierce attack on class enemies and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, we must follow Chairman Mao's latest teachings and rely even more on the broad revolutionary masses, respecting the revolutionary initiative of the masses.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must make every comrade understand that as long as we rely on the people, firmly believe that the creative power of the masses is boundless, and thus trust the people and unite with them, then we can overcome any difficulty and no enemy can defeat us; they will only be defeated by us." Soldiers and officers fighting on the front lines of the "Three Supports, Two Militaries," while seriously studying and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, recalled Chairman Mao's teachings, saying that only by resolutely implementing and carrying out Chairman Mao's latest instructions can we fully bring into play the powerful force of the dictatorship of the masses, strengthen the proletarian dictatorship, and consolidate and develop the newly born Revolutionary Committees. Soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the Guangzhou Army executing the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" tasks in Guangzhou City, after the birth of the Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City Revolutionary Committees, followed Chairman Mao's teachings and organized many Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, assisting factories, offices, schools, and neighborhoods in establishing class teams for the dictatorship of the masses. As soon as Chairman Mao's latest instructions were issued, they immediately studied and discussed them with the broad revolutionary masses. Armed with Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, they studied the new situations, new characteristics, and new trends of class struggle, further deepened the great struggle of revolutionary criticism, and launched a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies. A certain unit's Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, closely united with the revolutionary masses of the Styrene Paper Factory in Shenyang City, took the initiative to attack class enemies. After studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, they summarized the experiences of fighting against enemies, further mobilized the masses, and organized an even more vast revolutionary army, rooting out the class enemies hiding in dark corners, spreading evil winds, and igniting evil fires, attempting to split the ranks of the proletarian revolutionary forces, and consolidating and strengthening the newly born Revolutionary Committees in the waves of class struggle.

    解放军“三支”“两军”指战员把毛主席最新指示作为强大的思想武器
    坚定不移地支持和保护广大人民群众
    把“三支”“两军”工作做得好上加好
    据新华社六日讯　战斗在“三支”“两军”第一线的人民解放军陆海空三军广大指战员，怀着深厚的无产阶级感情，雷厉风行地认真学习和落实伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”广大指战员把毛主席的最新指示记在本子上，逐字逐句地背熟，作为座右铭。他们一致指出，毛主席的最新指示，为我们进一步做好“三支”“两军”工作，提供了强大的思想武器。人民解放军是为着广大人民群众的利益而结合，而战斗的。我们一定要以门合同志为榜样，坚决贯彻、落实毛主席的最新指示，永远相信和依靠人民群众，永远和人民群众打成一片，永远和人民群众心连心，永远为保护人民群众的利益而战斗，坚决贯彻执行和捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，把“三支”“两军”工作做得好上加好，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中，为人民再立新功。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”战斗在全国各地“三支”“两军”第一线的广大指战员，结合斗争实践，认真学习毛主席最新指示时，深深体会到，毛主席的这一最新指示，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的指路明灯，是指引我们胜利完成“三支”“两军”任务的根本方针。南京部队“临汾旅”的指战员们说，伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造了中国人民解放军，并为我军规定了“紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务”这个唯一的宗旨。人民解放军总是紧紧地同人民群众团结战斗在一起，满腔热情地给人民群众以巨大的支援。在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，只有遵照毛主席的伟大教导，坚决相信和依靠群众，支持和保护群众，尊重群众的革命首创精神，才能把这场政治大革命进行到底。被誉为“支左红旗”的四川省自贡市人民武装部指战员兴奋地说，我们在毛主席的“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大教导下，和左派广大群众团结在一起，战斗在一起，取得了伟大胜利。我们一定要进一步用毛主席的最新指示武装自己的头脑，以门合同志为榜样，处处爱护群众，永远把群众的利益放在第一位，同广大群众一起夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    毛主席教导我们：“必须站在人民群众这一边，绝不能站到人民敌人那一边去。这是一个马克思列宁主义者的根本立场问题。”执行“三支”“两军”任务的广大指战员，学习了毛主席的最新指示以后，深深体会到，对人民群众是保护还是镇压，这是区别人民军队和一切反动军队的根本标志。他们说，支左工作千条万条，用毛泽东思想武装群众，坚定不移地支持、保护革命群众，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，是头一条。只有相信群众，依靠群众，团结一切革命力量，组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，才能使一小撮阶级敌人完全陷于“人民战争”的汪洋大海之中。在黑龙江省伊春林区执行“三支”“两军”任务的人民解放军某部指战员，结合自己的斗争实践说，伊春林区革命委员会成立以后，阶级敌人不甘心失败，他们大耍反革命两面派手法，煽动一部分受蒙蔽的群众把矛头指向革命委员会，妄想颠覆新生的革命委员会，实行反革命复辟，我们支左部队帮助革委会对受蒙蔽的群众进行了深入细致的思想政治工作，使他们纷纷觉醒，积极投入革命大批判的斗争，粉碎了阶级敌人的猖狂进攻。在上海一个学校中执行军训任务的东海舰队指战员说，经验证明，只要我们坚定地站在革命群众一边，放手发动群众，紧紧地依靠群众，斗争一定会胜利。在向阶级敌人发起猛烈攻击、夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的斗争中，我们一定要遵照毛主席的最新教导，更加依靠广大革命群众，尊重群众的革命首创精神。
    毛主席教导我们：“应该使每一个同志懂得，只要我们依靠人民，坚决地相信人民群众的创造力是无穷无尽的，因而信任人民，和人民打成一片，那就任何困难也能克服，任何敌人也不能压倒我们，而只会被我们所压倒。”战斗在“三支”“两军”第一线的广大指战员，在认真学习和落实毛主席最新指示的时候，重温了毛主席的这一教导，纷纷说，只有坚决贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，才能充分发挥群众专政的强大威力，强化无产阶级专政，巩固和发展新生的革命委员会。正在广州市担任“三支”“两军”任务的广州部队某部指战员，在广东省和广州市革命委员会胜利诞生之后，遵循毛主席的教导，组织了许多毛泽东思想宣传队，协助工厂、机关、学校、街道广大革命群众，建立起了群众专政的阶级队伍。毛主席的最新指示一传出，他们又立即和广大革命群众一起，认真学习、座谈。他们以毛主席的一系列最新指示为武器，研究阶级斗争的新形势、新特点、新动向，更加深入地开展了革命大批判，稳、准、狠地向一小撮阶级敌人发动了猛烈进攻。同沈阳市人民造纸厂革命群众紧密团结在一起，向阶级敌人主动进攻的某部毛泽东思想宣传队，认真学习了毛主席的最新指示，总结了对敌斗争的经验，进一步发动群众，组织起更加浩浩荡荡的革命大军，把隐藏在阴暗角落里煽阴风、点邪火，妄图分裂无产阶级革命队伍的阶级敌人挖了出来，使新生的革命委员会在阶级斗争的风浪中不断巩固和加强。
