The storm of mass struggle in Italy has struck fear into the hearts of reactionaries. After the corrupt art exhibition in Venice was forced to close immediately following its "opening" due to the resolute resistance of the masses, workers in Trieste held a demonstration and bravely fought back against police brutality, making the reactionary authorities tremble with fear. The leaders of the Italian Communist Party hurriedly came out to attack the just struggles of workers and students, acting as slaves and lackeys of the monopolistic capitalists.

New China News Agency, June 24: The just struggles against the oppression and exploitation of the monopolistic bourgeoisie and against the corrupt capitalist system are continuing to develop in Italy.

Students and workers in cities such as Venice and Trieste have been holding demonstrations and marches for days, bravely fighting back against the brutal suppression by the Italian reactionary authorities.

In the famous Italian city of Venice, with the support of progressive students from home and abroad, the local people have been carrying out a mass movement against the 34th Venice International Art Exhibition since June 17, which has lasted for a week.

In recent days, despite police suppression, large numbers of students, workers, and artists have repeatedly held demonstrations and marches, opposing the bourgeoisie's money-stinking art and the corrupt capitalist system.

On June 22, the Italian authorities, under the protection of a large number of fully armed police, held the so-called "opening ceremony" of the exhibition. However, fearing that the people would revolt, the exhibition was immediately closed after the "opening" and dared not open to the public. Several dozen artists from Italy and other countries withdrew from the exhibition, expressing their support for the just struggles of students and workers and opposing the police's brutal suppression of the people.

On June 23, large numbers of students and workers, waving red flags, once again held a demonstration in front of the exhibition. The police used tear gas and batons to savagely attack the crowd. Students and workers built barricades in front of the exhibition and bravely fought back with stones.

In the northeastern port city of Trieste, tens of thousands of striking workers and sailors, with the support of students, held a massive demonstration on June 22 and 23, strongly condemning the police authorities' brutal suppression of the people. The police threw tear gas at the demonstrators and savagely beat them with batons. Workers and students once again built barricades and bravely fought back with stones and homemade Molotov cocktails. They rushed into several gas stations, pushed out oil drums, and poured gasoline on the streets to block the advance of police cars. The outraged demonstrators also burned down a police station. The reactionary authorities, frightened by the brave struggles of workers and students, hurriedly ordered the police to patrol Trieste day and night.

In the southern Italian city of Palermo, more than 5,000 metalworkers and machine makers held a strike and march on June 21, opposing the brutal exploitation of monopolistic capital and demanding wage increases and full employment. The police used batons and chains to beat the demonstrators. The workers fought fiercely with the police and broke through the police cordon, coming to the local government building to hold a long demonstration.

On June 22, the printing workers of newspapers and news agencies across Italy went on strike again, demanding wage increases and improved working conditions. This was the third nationwide strike by newspaper and news agency printing workers in eight days. This strike prevented Italian newspapers from being published on the afternoon of June 22 and June 23.

The Italian Communist Party leadership, which has always been obsessed with the "parliamentary road" and "peaceful transition," is terrified and enraged by the rebellious actions of Italian students and workers. On June 22, the general secretary of the Italian Communist Party, Longo, in Rome, gnashed his teeth and attacked the just struggles of Italian students, calling them "creating 'chaos'" and cursing the student movement as "extremism," vigorously defending the rule of the Italian monopolistic bourgeoisie. This clearly shows that the Italian and French Communist Parties are birds of a feather, all old-time labor traitors and renegades, who have been frightened by the people's revolutionary storm and are willing to act as slaves and lackeys of the monopolistic bourgeoisie.

Under the strong protest of progressive students in Italy, the Italian reactionary authorities, feeling guilty, hurriedly sent police to close the doors of the 34th Venice International Art Exhibition.

    意大利群众斗争风暴吓破反动派的胆
    在威尼斯群众坚决抵制下腐朽艺术展览会“开幕”后立即被迫关门的里亚斯特工人示威游行英勇反击警察暴行使反动当局胆战心惊
    意修头目急忙跳出来攻击工人和学生的正义斗争甘当垄断资本的奴才和走狗
    新华社二十四日讯罗马消息：意大利反对垄断资产阶级的压迫和剥削、反对腐朽的资本主义制度的正义斗争正在继续发展。
    威尼斯的里亚斯特等城市的学生和工人，连日来不断举行示威游行，英勇反击意大利反动当局的残暴镇压。
    在意大利著名的城市威尼斯，当地人民在国内外进步学生的支持下，从十七日开始的抵制第三十四届威尼斯国际艺术展览会的群众运动，已坚持了一个星期。
    连日来，大批学生、工人、艺术工作者不顾警察的镇压，一再举行示威游行，反对资产阶级的铜臭艺术，反对腐朽的资本主义制度。
    二十二日，意大利当局在大批全副武装的警察的保护下，举行了展览会的所谓“开幕仪式”。但是，由于害怕人民前来造反，展览会在“开幕”以后马上关上大门，不敢向公众开放。意大利和其他国家的几十个艺术家退出了这个展览会，表示支持学生、工人们的正义斗争，反对警察镇压人民的暴行。
    二十三日，大批学生和工人挥舞着红旗，再次在展览会前举行示威，警察使用催泪弹和棍棒野蛮地袭击群众。学生和工人在展览会门前筑起壁垒，用石头向警察英勇反击。
    在意大利东北的大港的里亚斯特，成千上万的罢工的工人、海员，在学生的支持下，二十二日接连第二天在市内举行反对垄断资产阶级的声势浩大的示威游行，强烈谴责警察当局对人民群众的残暴镇压。警察向示威群众投掷催泪弹，并挥舞棍棒野蛮殴打示威者。工人、学生们再次筑起街垒，用石块和自制燃烧瓶英勇还击。他们冲进几个加油站，推出汽油桶，把汽油洒在街道上，阻挡警车前进。义愤填膺的示威者还烧毁了一个警察派出所。被工人与学生的英勇斗争吓得胆战心惊的反动当局，慌忙下令警察在的里亚斯特日夜巡逻。
    在意大利南部的巴勒莫，五千多名五金和机器制造工人，二十一日举行罢工和游行，反对垄断资本的残酷剥削，要求增加工资和充分就业。警察使用棍棒和铁链殴打示威者。工人们同警察进行了激烈的搏斗，并冲破了警察的封锁线，来到当地政府大楼前，举行了长时间的示威。
    意大利全国报纸和通讯社的印刷工人二十二日再次举行罢工，要求增加工资和改善工作条件。这是报纸和通讯社的印刷工人在八天内的第三次全国性罢工。这次罢工使得意大利全国的报纸二十二日下午和二十三日无法出版。
    一贯醉心于“议会道路”、“和平过渡”的意修领导集团，对于意大利学生和工人的造反行动怕得要死，恨得要命。意修总书记隆哥二十二日在罗马咬牙切齿地攻击意大利学生的正义斗争是制造“骚乱”，咒骂学生运动是“极端主义”，极力维护意大利垄断资产阶级的统治。这清楚表明，意修、法修是一丘之貉，都是老牌工贼与叛徒，他们被人民的革命风暴吓破了胆，甘当垄断资产阶级的奴才和走狗。（附图片）
    在意大利进步学生的强烈抗议下，意大利反动当局做贼心虚，慌忙派警察把第三十四届威尼斯国际艺术展览会的大门关上。
