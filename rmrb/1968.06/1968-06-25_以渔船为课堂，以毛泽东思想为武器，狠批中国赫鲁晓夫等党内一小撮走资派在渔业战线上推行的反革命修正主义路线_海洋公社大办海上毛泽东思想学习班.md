Fishermen of the Haiyang Commune in Longhai County, Liaoning Province's Lüda City, with the help of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, have set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes on the sea, using fishing boats as classrooms and Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon. They have severely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pushed by the capitalist roaders within the party, such as the Chinese Khrushchev, on the fishery front. This has greatly raised the fishermen's awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, leading to victories in both revolution and production.

The Haiyang Commune is located on a small island in Longhai County. Most of the labor force on this island is engaged in fishery production, spending ten months of the year working at sea. In the past, due to poor organization, the revolutionary criticism campaign had not been effectively carried out. Some fishermen even thought that the dispersed and mobile nature of deep-sea operations, combined with the need for round-the-clock production, made it difficult to conduct in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism.

The People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team addressed these concerns by organizing the fishermen to study Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle, particularly his instruction to "never forget class struggle." This helped the fishermen understand that revolutionary criticism is a great strategic deployment by Chairman Mao, a major direction for revolutionary struggle, and a crucial measure to ensure that our proletarian iron kingdom remains unchanged for a thousand generations. Only by continuously launching fierce attacks on the class enemy and conducting in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism can we thoroughly eliminate the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism spread by the capitalist roaders within the party, such as the Chinese Khrushchev, on the fishery front, and promote our own ideological revolutionization.

After raising their awareness, the fishermen immediately set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes on each boat and established "Criticize and Rectify" columns. The fishermen studied Chairman Mao's works every day on the boats and criticized the Chinese Khrushchev. Whether leaving or returning to port, they studied Chairman Mao's works and criticized the Chinese Khrushchev wherever they went.

The revolutionary criticism has greatly heightened the fishermen's awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. Armed with the "Three Articles," they severely criticized their own selfish thoughts and resolved to dedicate their lives to revolutionary fishing.

    以渔船为课堂，以毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派在渔业战线上推行的反革命修正主义路线
    海洋公社大办海上毛泽东思想学习班
    辽宁省旅大市长海县海洋公社广大渔民，在驻军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，大办海上毛泽东思想学习班，以渔船为课堂，以毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派在渔业战线上推行的反革命修正主义路线，大大提高了广大渔民的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，夺取了革命、生产双胜利。
    海洋公社位于长海县的一个小岛上，这个岛上的主要劳动力大部分都从事渔业生产，一年有十个月在海上作业，过去，由于没有组织好，革命大批判一直没有能很好地开展起来。有的渔民还认为，远洋生产作业点分散，流动性大，又要昼夜生产，深入持久地开展革命大批判有很多困难。
    驻军毛泽东思想宣传队针对这些活思想，组织大家结合解放以来渔业战线上和岛上两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的实际，反复学习毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，使广大渔民认识到：革命大批判是毛主席的伟大战略部署，是革命斗争的大方向，是保证我们无产阶级的铁打江山千秋万代永不变色的重大措施。只有不停顿地向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，深入持久地开展革命大批判，才能彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派在渔业战线上散布的反革命修正主义流毒，促进自己的思想革命化。广大渔民认识提高后，立即以船为单位，举办了海上毛泽东思想学习班，并且船船办起了“斗私批修专栏”。渔民们在船上天天学习毛主席著作，天天批判中国赫鲁晓夫。他们出港回港，走到那里就在那里学习毛主席著作，走到那里就在那里批判中国赫鲁晓夫。
    革命的大批判，大大提高了广大渔民的阶级斗争觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟。他们以“老三篇”为武器，狠斗自己的私心杂念，决心一辈子为革命打鱼。
