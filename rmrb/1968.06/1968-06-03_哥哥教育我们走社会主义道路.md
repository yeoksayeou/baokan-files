Brother Teaches Us to Follow the Socialist Path

Comrade Men He's younger brother, Men Jin

My brother, Men He, sacrificed his life to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and to save twenty-seven class brothers. My brother died for the people's interests; his death is heavier than Mount Tai. I am especially proud and honored to have such a brother who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

My brother grew up in hardship and from a young age, he hated landlords, rich peasants, Japanese devils, and the Kuomintang reactionaries. I remember when our family fled to Xuanhua, one time my brother took me begging for food. On the way, we encountered Japanese devils. They pointed at the big wolf dog beside them, and the dog lunged at us with its bloody maw. My brother tightly protected me, but his legs were bitten and bloodied. He firmly remembered this and clenched his fist, saying to me, "When I join the Eighth Route Army, I will personally kill these devil dogs!"

After my brother joined the army, in the great school of Mao Zedong Thought that is the People's Liberation Army, his proletarian consciousness and awareness of the struggle between the two lines continuously improved. He often wrote letters to educate our whole family to raise our proletarian consciousness and resolutely follow the socialist path indicated by Chairman Mao.

Every time my brother came home to visit, he would always investigate the class struggle situation in the village thoroughly. Once, when he came home, he went to the production brigade to work and found that a landlord element was shirking work. He used this incident to educate me, saying, "Landlords and rich peasants will never be honest; we poor and lower-middle peasants must supervise them well and resolutely struggle against them!" He also said, "You must always remember Chairman Mao's teaching: 'Never forget class struggle.'"

My brother never forgot the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads. In 1961, a handful of capitalist roaders in the Lyuan County Party accepted the black directive of "three freedoms and one contract" from the Chinese Khrushchev and shouted like madmen, "To overcome difficulties, we must open up more small plots of waste land!" This caused the whole county to be in chaos. Just at this autumn, my brother came home to visit. Seeing this situation, he immediately realized that this was a serious class struggle, a major issue of whether to follow the socialist or capitalist road, and immediately said to me, "Opening up small plots of waste land and pursuing individual freedom is following the capitalist road. We poor and lower-middle peasants must not forget our past sufferings and let the landlords and rich peasants ride on our heads again. We must take the lead in doing well in collective production and take the lead in following the socialist road." Then, my brother used our family's history of fleeing and begging in the old society, selling four family members, to educate my parents, sister, and me to remember the bitterness of the class struggle, not to forget the blood debt, and resolutely resist the capitalist restoration wind.

During the Cultural Revolution, my brother specially wrote a letter to the whole family, telling us to listen to Chairman Mao's words: "You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" With my brother's help, I joined the revolutionary mass organization and criticized the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Lyuan County. At this critical moment of life-and-death struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, I stood on the side of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin Biao, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Countless martyrs have sacrificed their lives for the people's interests ahead of us. Let us hold high their banners and march forward on their bloodstained path!" Now, although my brother has left us, his brilliant image of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line will forever live in people's hearts. I will learn from my brother and definitely follow the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, never forget class struggle, never forget proletarian dictatorship, never forget to emphasize politics, and never forget to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. I will struggle in the great criticism all my life, actively attack the class enemy all my life, and always stand guard and fight well for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

    哥哥教育我们走社会主义道路
    门合同志的弟弟  门金
    我哥哥门合，为保卫毛主席的革命路线，为救护二十七名阶级兄弟，英勇牺牲了。哥哥是为人民利益而死的，他的死是比泰山还要重的。我有这样无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好哥哥，感到特别光荣和自豪。
    哥哥是在苦水里泡大的，他从小就仇恨地主、富农，仇恨日本鬼子和国民党反动派。记得俺家在宣化逃荒时，有一回哥哥领着我去要饭，路上碰见了日本鬼子，鬼子用手指了指身边的大狼狗，那狗便张着血盆大口朝我俩扑来。哥哥紧紧地护住我，他自己的腿却被咬得鲜血直流。这笔账，哥哥牢牢地记在心里，他满腔怒火，紧握拳头对我说：“等我当了八路军，非亲手宰了这些狗鬼子不可！”
    哥哥参军后，在人民解放军这座毛泽东思想大学校里，无产阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟不断地提高。他经常写信教育我们全家，要提高无产阶级觉悟，坚决走毛主席指引的社会主义道路。
    哥哥每次回来探家，总要把村里的阶级斗争情况打听个一清二楚。有一次，他回家时到生产队去干活，发现一个地主分子消极怠工，他就用这件事教育我说：“地主富农啥时也老实不了，咱们贫下中农要好好监督他们，要坚决同他们作斗争！”他还说：“你要永远记住毛主席的教导：‘千万不要忘记阶级斗争’。”
    哥哥对社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，更是念念不忘。一九六一年，涞源县党内一小撮走资派从中国赫鲁晓夫那里接受了“三自一包”的黑旨意，象疯子一样大喊大叫：“要想渡过困难，非多开小片荒地不可！”闹得全县乌烟瘴气。正好在这年秋天哥哥回家探亲，他看到这情况，马上觉察出这是一场严重的阶级斗争，是走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路的大是大非问题，就立即对我说：“开小片荒，搞小自由，这是走资本主义道路，咱们贫下中农决不能好了疮疤忘了疼，让地主富农重新骑在咱头上拉屎拉尿，咱们要带头搞好集体生产，带头走社会主义道路。”接着，哥哥又用我们家在旧社会逃荒要饭、先后卖掉四口人的血泪史，教育父母、妹妹和我，牢记阶级苦，不忘血泪仇，坚决顶住复辟资本主义的妖风。
    文化大革命期间，哥哥专门来信要全家人听毛主席的话：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”在哥哥的帮助下，我参加了革命群众组织，造了中国赫鲁晓夫和他在涞源县的代理人的反。在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线生死搏斗的关键时刻，我站在以毛主席为首、林彪副主席为副的无产阶级司令部一边，与贫下中农一起，捍卫了毛主席的革命路线。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“成千成万的先烈，为着人民的利益，在我们的前头英勇地牺牲了，让我们高举起他们的旗帜，踏着他们的血迹前进吧！”现在，哥哥虽然离开了我们，但他那无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的光辉形象，却永远活在人们心里。我决心向哥哥看齐，一定遵照林彪副主席的指示，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活一辈子，搞一辈子革命的大批判，向阶级敌人主动进攻一辈子，时刻为毛主席的无产阶级革命路线放好哨，站好岗，打好仗。
