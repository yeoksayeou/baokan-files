Currently, the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world are achieving victory after victory, and the situation is excellent. The imperialists led by the United States are having an increasingly difficult time. The so-called "British Empire," which once dominated the world, is now moribund and its situation is increasingly grim. The decline of the "British Empire" is a microcosm of the current capitalist world and a reflection of the comprehensive collapse of imperialism.

As early as 1949, our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "We are now in an era when the imperialist system is heading towards complete collapse, and the imperialists are in an insoluble crisis." The numerous facts of the past nineteen years have fully proven the correctness of Chairman Mao's brilliant judgment.

Post-war British economy has always been sluggish. Domestic production equipment is outdated, cannot be discarded, and cannot be changed, always in a backward state. In recent years, the British economy has shown a state of decline. In 1967, important industries such as steel, coal, machinery manufacturing, and automobiles either saw significant reductions in production or were in a state of stagnation. The "lifeline" of the British economy, foreign trade, has continued to deteriorate, with international payments showing a deficit year after year, and the pound's credit in the international market has greatly declined. In 1966 alone, there were five waves of pound selling in the international market.

The Wilson government, in order to get out of the predicament, racked its brains and came up with a desperate measure, announcing the devaluation of the pound by one-seventh in November of last year. However, what good did the devaluation of the pound do! Production is still sluggish, the market is in chaos, prices are generally rising, and unemployment is more serious. The devalued pound cannot save Britain's financial difficulties at all. In the same month, British Finance Minister Callaghan was forced to resign. Wilson passed the mess on to Jenkins, but Jenkins, like the devalued pound, was equally unable to help the Wilson government.

The imperialist power known as a "great power," in order to increase income, change the sluggish economic situation, and at the same time vie for a place in Europe, has been trying to squeeze into the "Common Market" of the six Western European countries centered around West Germany and France in recent years. However, the "Common Market" does not buy it. France even openly declared: "Britain must be in a good economic, monetary, and financial position" before it can join the "Common Market." The once-mighty "British Empire" has fallen to this point and can only endure humiliation, ridicule, and sarcasm. Even on February 18, when Britain stopped using Greenwich Mean Time, the Associated Press mocked that Britain was adjusting its clocks to enter the "Common Market." Britain's status among capitalist countries can be seen from this.

In the previous period, the capitalist world experienced the most severe and profound financial crisis in forty years. This financial crisis, triggered by the gold-buying frenzy, not only accelerated the collapse of the dollar but also severely hit the pound, which is closely related to the dollar and in a precarious position, making British imperialism frantic and disheveled. The British government first raised the price of gold and then had to announce the closure of the London gold market to control the large outflow of gold. These measures by British imperialism fully illustrate its weakness and also show that it is deeply mired in an insoluble crisis.

Moreover, even overseas troops have become a heavy burden for the "British Empire." The counter-revolutionary "Suez east" military policy has not only failed to stop the revolutionary storm of the Asian and African peoples but has further weakened British imperialism. The British "Defense White Paper" published in 1966 openly admitted that Britain is unable to "conduct major wars alone overseas." The annual military expenditure of 2.2 billion pounds in the "Suez east" has deepened Britain's financial crisis, forcing the Wilson government to decide to withdraw all troops from the "Suez east" before the mid-1970s, once again exposing the paper tiger nature of British imperialism in front of the people of the world. By 1968, the Wilson government was having a hard time, and it was also powerless to act as a military lackey for American imperialism, guarding the "second line of defense." On January 16 of this year, the British government was forced to announce the early withdrawal of troops, that is, the withdrawal of British colonial troops from the Far East and the Persian Gulf before 1971, and the cancellation of the order for 50 F-111 fighter-bombers worth $1 billion from the United States. This marks the complete failure of the "Suez east" military policy of the "British Empire." British bourgeois newspapers say that these measures by the British government are a "bankruptcy application." In fact, it should be said that it is a "bankruptcy certificate."

The great teacher Chairman Mao said: "The imperialist system is riddled with internal contradictions that cannot be overcome, plunging the imperialists into great anguish." The situation of the British Labour government is exactly like this.

Facing this internal and external predicament, the British ruling class is in constant internal strife. Wilson is at a loss, and his only "solution" is to cut into the British working people, greatly increasing taxes and asking the people to "tighten their belts." The various reactionary measures of the Wilson government in the country are increasingly meeting with dissatisfaction and strong opposition from the British people. The further intensification of class contradictions at home, the collapse of the colonial system abroad, and the failure of foreign policies everywhere have put the Wilson government in a political crisis more serious than the economic crisis.

It should be noted that the British Foreign Secretary Brown, who once performed brilliantly on the political stage, resigned on March 15. It was this Brown who, at the beginning of this year, still puffed up his face and boasted that "without Britain, there would be no Europe." However, in a short time, this foreign secretary has stepped down in disgrace. Brown's resignation is a sign of the complete failure of the internal and external policies pursued by the Wilson government over the past few years.

It is well known that the so-called "British Empire" is a colonial upstart who made his fortune by trafficking African blacks and ruthlessly plundering the colonial peoples. The colonies are its lifeline. In its heyday, it boasted: "The sun never sets on the British Empire," how arrogant it was! But in the face of the powerful revolutionary people, the "British Empire" is just a paper tiger. Especially after World War II, due to the unprecedented upsurge of the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and various countries in the world, the old colonial system of British imperialism has rapidly collapsed, and the "British Empire" has declined even faster.

Now, the "British Empire" where the sun never sets has reached the end of the road. On the international stage, Britain's status as a great power has long since plummeted, and at best it can only be a vassal and servant of American imperialism.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The enemy will not disappear on its own." Like all reactionaries in the world, British imperialism is also unwilling to accept its defeat and is making its last desperate struggle. The devaluation of the pound, the withdrawal of troops from the "Suez east," the intensification of plunder of the working people at home, and the promotion of neo-colonialism in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are all manifestations of this desperate struggle. It actively follows the aggressive and war policies of American imperialism, acting as a henchman of American imperialism, attempting to raise its plummeting international status and prolong its life. However, all these efforts cannot save the declining fate of the "British Empire." What awaits it in the future is only the grave dug by the British proletariat and the revolutionary people of the world!

    病入膏肓的“大英帝国”
    永红
    目前，世界人民的革命斗争节节胜利，形势一片大好。以美国为首的帝国主义，日子越来越不好过。一度称霸世界的所谓“大英帝国”，更是病入膏肓，处境越来越不妙了。“大英帝国”的没落，是当前资本主义世界的一个缩影，也是帝国主义走向全面崩溃的写照。
    早在一九四九年，我们伟大领袖毛主席就指出：“我们现在所处的时代是帝国主义制度走向全部崩溃的时代，帝国主义者业已陷入不可解脱的危机之中”。十九年来的无数事实，充分证明了毛主席的这一英明论断。
    战后的英国经济，一直就是不景气。国内生产设备陈旧，抛不掉，又改不了，一直处于落后状况。近年来，英国经济更呈现出一蹶不振的萧条景象。一九六七年，钢铁、煤炭、机器制造、汽车等重要工业不是大幅度减产，就是处于停顿状态。作为英国经济“生命线”的对外贸易又不断恶化，国际收支连年出现逆差，英镑在国际市场上信用大大下降；仅在一九六六年一年中，国际市场上就爆发了五次抛售英镑的风潮。
    威尔逊政府为了摆脱困境，挖空心思想出了个饮鸩止渴的办法，在去年十一月间宣布英镑贬值七分之一。然而，英镑贬值又何济于事！生产依然萧条，市场一片混乱，物价普遍高涨，失业现象更为严重。贬值后的英镑丝毫也不能挽救英国的财政困难。就在同一个月里，英国财政大臣卡拉汉便不得不辞职。威尔逊把烂摊子交给了詹金斯，但詹金斯跟贬值的英镑一样，同样帮不了威尔逊政府的忙。
    号称“世界大国”的英帝国主义，为了增加收入，改变一蹶不振的经济状况，同时为了在欧洲大陆上争一席地位，近年来一直想挤进以西德—法国为核心的西欧六国“共同市场”，但“共同市场”并不买它的账。法国甚至公开声称：“英国必须在经济上、货币上、财政上处于良好的地位”，才可加入“共同市场”。堂堂“大英帝国”沦落到这步田地，也只得忍气吞声，受尽奚落、讽刺和挖苦。连二月十八日英国停用格林威治时间，美联社也嘲笑说，英国为了走向“共同市场”而校准它的钟表。英国在资本主义国家中的地位，于此可见一斑。
    前一个时期，资本主义世界爆发了四十年来最严重、最深刻的金融危机。这场由抢购黄金风潮引起的金融危机，不仅加速了美元的垮台，同时也沉重地打击着与美元休戚相关、地位脆弱的英镑，使英帝国主义弄得焦头烂额，狼狈不堪。英国政府始而提高金价，继而被迫宣布关闭伦敦黄金市场，以控制黄金的大量外流。英帝国主义这些措施充分说明了它的虚弱，也说明了它深深地陷入了不可解脱的危机之中。
    不但如此，甚至海外驻军也成了“大英帝国”的沉重包袱。反革命的“苏伊士以东”军事政策，不但没有能阻挡亚非人民的革命风暴，反而进一步削弱了英帝国主义。一九六六年公布的英国“国防白皮书”，就已公开招认英国无力在国外单独“从事重大的战争行动”。年达二十二亿英镑的“苏伊士以东”军事开支，加深了英国的财政危机，迫得威尔逊政府不得不作出在七十年代中期以前从苏伊士以东全部撤军的决定，在全世界人民面前再次暴露出英帝国主义的纸老虎原形。到了一九六八年，威尔逊政府更是日子难过，它连在军事上做美帝国主义小伙计，替美国看守“第二道防线”也有心无力。今年一月十六日，英国政府又被迫宣布提前撤出军队，即在一九七一年以前从远东和波斯湾撤退英国殖民军队，并取消向美国订购的价值十亿美元的五十架F—111战斗轰炸机。这就宣告了
  “大英帝国”的“苏伊士以东”军事政策的彻底破产。英国资产阶级报纸说，英国政府的这些措施，是一项
  “破产申请书”。其实，应该说是“破产证明书”。
    伟大导师毛主席说：“帝国主义制度内部的矛盾重重，无法克服，使帝国主义者陷入了极大的苦闷中。”英国工党政府的情况正是如此。
    英国统治集团面对着这种内外交困的绝境，内部争吵不休。威尔逊对此一筹莫展，他的唯一“办法”，就是向英国劳动人民开刀，大肆增加税收，要求人民“勒紧裤带”。威尔逊政府在国内的种种反动措施，越来越遭到英国人民的不满和强烈反对。国内阶级矛盾的进一步加剧，国外殖民地体系的土崩瓦解，对外政策的到处碰壁，使威尔逊政府面临着比经济危机更严重的政治危机。
    应该提到的是，曾经在政治舞台上大大表演了一番的英外交大臣布朗已于三月十五日宣告辞职了。正是这个布朗，今年初，还打肿脸充胖子，胡说什么“没有英国，就没有欧洲”。然而，曾几何时，这个外交大臣便黯然下台。布朗的下台，正是威尔逊政府几年来推行的内外政策连连破产的表征。
    众所周知，所谓“大英帝国”，是靠贩卖非洲黑人、疯狂掠夺殖民地人民起家的殖民暴发户，殖民地是它的命根子。想当年，它不可一世的时候，曾自吹自擂地说：“在大英帝国领土上太阳是从不落下的”，气焰是何等嚣张！可是，在强大的革命人民面前，“大英帝国”不过是一只纸老虎。特别是第二次世界大战以后，由于亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和世界各国人民革命斗争的空前高涨，英帝国主义的旧的殖民体系迅速瓦解，“大英帝国”就更加迅速地衰落了。
    现在，“日不落”的“大英帝国”已经到了山穷水尽的地步。在国际舞台上，英国作为一个大国的地位早已一落千丈，它充其量也只能当上一个美帝国主义的附庸与仆从。
    毛主席教导我们说：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。”同世界上一切反动派一样，英帝国主义也决不甘心于它的失败的，它还在作最后的垂死挣扎。英镑贬值，从苏伊士以东撤军，在国内加紧向劳动人民掠夺，对亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲加紧推行新殖民主义，等等，都是这种垂死挣扎的表现。它还积极追随美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，充当美帝国主义的帮凶，企图以此抬高其一落千丈的国际地位，苟延残喘。但是，所有这些都不能挽救“大英帝国”的没落命运。而在前面等待着它的，只能是英国无产阶级和世界革命人民给它掘好的坟墓！
