The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The reform of state organs, the most fundamental point, is to link up with the masses." The standing committee members of the Yichun Municipal Revolutionary Committee in Heilongjiang Province have followed Chairman Mao's teachings, carrying Chairman Mao's revolutionary works, and with their belongings on their shoulders, they have gone deep into the grassroots and among the masses. They learn from the revolutionary masses, do revolution together with the masses, and make continuous progress on the road to the revolutionization of the leading cadre corps, making the newly born revolutionary committee more powerful.

Since the end of last year, out of the 18 standing committee members of the Yichun Municipal Revolutionary Committee, 12 have gone deep into the forest areas where class struggle and production struggle are most intense, and have worked together with the broad revolutionary masses to grasp revolution and promote production. From their personal experiences, they deeply feel that going deep into the grassroots and among the masses, using Mao Zedong Thought to thoroughly reform one's worldview, and maintaining close ties with the people are important ways to achieve the revolutionization of the leading cadre corps; they are fundamental measures to maintain the character of the working people, resist the infiltration of bourgeois and non-proletarian thoughts, prevent bureaucratism, and prevent revisionism.

Should one go among the masses or stay in the lower-level organs?

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We should go among the people and learn from them."

After the standing committee members of the Yichun Municipal Revolutionary Committee went down, they did not stay in the lower-level revolutionary committee organs but went all the way down to the masses, making their thoughts directly face the masses, consciously accepting the supervision of the masses, and humbly listening to the voices of the masses. They reflected the opinions, demands, and wishes of the masses upward, making the newly born revolutionary committee always maintain a close bond with the masses, always represent the interests of the masses, and serve the people wholeheartedly.

Revolutionary mass representative and standing committee member Lin Yunxi, after going to Nancha District, was prepared an office by the district revolutionary committee. However, she did not move her belongings into the office but settled in the home of a poor peasant, Yang Xiutian. She used her schoolbag as a desk and worked wherever she went, maintaining close contact with the broad revolutionary masses. She mobilized the masses to hold family Mao Zedong Thought study classes, exposing class enemies hiding in the streets, and making the revolutionary situation in the streets better and better. Standing committee member Geng Guangyou, originally a young technician, had a struggle in his mind about whether to bring his belongings or not before going to Hongxing District. After studying Chairman Mao's teachings on the mass line, he realized that bringing or not bringing belongings is a superficial issue, while the essence is whether to stay in the office or among the masses. After raising his awareness, except for participating in the district revolutionary committee standing committee to discuss major issues, he went to the forest farm with his belongings, humbly listening to the opinions of the masses and doing revolution together with the masses. In the two months of going deep into the grassroots, he actively sought the opinions of the revolutionary masses five times, fought against selfishness and criticized revisionism, and promoted the revolutionization of his thoughts. Old worker and deputy director of the municipal revolutionary committee, Chen Rongyu, after more than two months of personal practice, deeply felt that: "When people go down, their thoughts should also go down. Only in this way can our hearts be connected with the masses, stick closer, and we can take root among the masses more deeply and firmly."

Should one stay among the masses for a long time or be a temporary worker among the masses?

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We should never leave the masses. In this way, we can know the masses, understand the masses, work together with the masses, and thus serve the people well."

At the beginning of going down, some revolutionary mass representatives felt that they had never done leadership work, had low levels, and were afraid that they could not complete the tasks assigned by the organization if they went down, holding a temporary view of going down to try it out and coming back if it didn't work; some thought that standing committee members were supposed to be "constant" in the organs to handle daily work, and they could not "stay" if they went down, lacking the idea of taking root among the masses for a long time. Could they "stay" or not? Should they stay among the masses for a long time or be temporary workers among the masses? They brought this question to Chairman Mao's works for guidance. Chairman Mao said: "We should never leave the masses. In this way, we can know the masses, understand the masses, work together with the masses, and thus serve the people well." They used Chairman Mao's teaching to compare with the black goods of Khrushchev advocating going among the masses to gain political capital for promotion and wealth, deeply realizing that only by following Chairman Mao's instructions can one establish the idea of serving the people "completely" and "thoroughly." Is it to be close to the masses or to be separated from the masses? This is the reflection of the struggle between the two lines in our minds, and in essence, it is the question of whether to make a revolution or to be an "official." Whether to follow Chairman Mao's instructions or not is a big test of whether we are loyal to Chairman Mao.

After solving the problem of awareness, whether the standing committee members went down to take up posts or went down to do spot work, except for participating in meetings that were very necessary to return to the city, they all stayed very steadily in the grassroots, working solidly with the masses to make a revolution. They studied, propagated, and implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions together with the masses, grasped class struggle, achieved remarkable results, and strongly promoted the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary masses, developed and consolidated the three-in-one combination, and promoted the revolution and production. The masses reflected: "You work like this, and we will always trust you."

Through this period of work, they had a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, absorbed nutrition from the masses, tasted the sweetness, and were more determined to take root among the masses for a long time and never leave the masses. Some comrades deeply felt: "Only by being unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and by reforming and tempering oneself in the long-term mass struggles, can one better serve the people."

After going down, in what attitude should one appear? Should one be a humble student of the masses and learn from them, or should one place oneself above the masses?

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and laughable," "We must adhere to the mass line, consult with the masses on every matter, and be students of the masses."

Before going down, the standing committee members of the Yichun Municipal Revolutionary Committee all had a common resolve and good wishes: to learn from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to temper and reform oneself, to push the revolution forward, and to promote production. However, from the situation of some standing committee members in the initial stage of going down, a problem was reflected: that is, after going down, in what attitude should one appear among the masses, placing oneself among the masses and being a student of the masses, or placing oneself above the masses?

Revolutionary mass representative (worker) and standing committee member Wang Danyou, after returning to his factory, went deep into the workshops. In less than a few days, he visited all the workshops and all the processes in the factory and expressed many opinions. Everyone was not used to his style, and some said: "The municipal standing committee member has come to command!" He felt very uncomfortable, thinking: "Why have the masses changed?" At this time, old worker Wang Ruixiang said to him: "Danyou, I think you have changed a bit this time." Was it himself who had changed a bit, or was it the masses who had changed a bit? Wang Danyou, with this question, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "There are many things, as long as we fall into blindness about them, lack self-awareness, they can become our burden, become our burden." He soberly felt that the one who had changed a bit was not the masses but himself. He realized that after becoming a standing committee member, his position had changed, and his thoughts had also changed, and he had grown "official airs." It was precisely because of his own changes that his attitude towards the masses had also changed a bit. After seriously studying Chairman Mao's teachings, he realized: "Having a bit of official airs, the distance from the masses is farther, and it is impossible to consciously carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and it is impossible to believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and respect the masses' pioneering spirit." After raising his awareness of the line struggle, he felt that "the masses are the real heroes," while he himself was childish and laughable. From then on, he consulted with the masses on every matter, took the masses as his teachers, and worked together with the masses to grasp the revolution and promote production. The masses no longer called him "standing committee member," the older ones called him "little Wang," the younger ones called him "old Wang," and those of the same age called him by his name "Danyou." Old worker Wang Ruixiang said with great joy: "You must always maintain this spirit, then you won't change. If you are like when you just came back, that's not guaranteed!"

This incident attracted the attention of the standing committee members. When they checked and summarized the problem of the revolutionization of the leading cadre corps, they all felt that after going down, in what attitude should one appear among the masses, this is a fundamental attitude and fundamental stance on whether to carry out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line or not. They thought that if the bourgeois worldview is not thoroughly reformed, although one has already landed among the masses, one cannot connect with the masses or organize the masses, and even less can one believe in the masses and rely on the masses, and thus cannot consciously carry out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "We must adhere to the mass line, consult with the masses on every matter, and be students of the masses." They decided to learn from the masses for life and serve the people wholeheartedly for life.

    无限忠于毛主席革命路线在群众斗争中改造自己
    锻炼自己伊春市革委会成员长期扎根于群众
    和群众一起学习、宣传、落实毛主席的最新指示，狠抓阶级斗争，有力地促进了革命大联合和革命三结合，推动了抓革命促生产
    据新华社哈尔滨十七日电　伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”黑龙江省伊春市革命委员会的常委们，遵循毛主席的教导，身带毛主席的革命宝书，肩背行李，纷纷深入基层，深入群众，向革命群众学习，同群众一道干革命，在实现领导班子革命化的道路上不断前进，使新生的革命委员会发挥出更强大的威力。
    从去年年底以来，伊春市革委会的十八名常委中，有十二名常委分别深入到林区阶级斗争和生产斗争第一线，同广大革命群众一起，狠抓革命，猛促生产。他们从自己的切身体验中深刻地感受到：深入基层，深入群众，用毛泽东思想彻底改造世界观，密切同人民群众的联系，这是实现领导班子革命化的重要途径；是永远保持劳动人民本色，抵制资产阶级和各种非无产阶级思想侵蚀，防止官僚主义，防止修正主义的根本措施。
    是一步踏入群众中去，还是一头扎进下一级机关里去？
    毛主席教导我们：“我们应该走到群众中间去，向群众学习”。
    伊春市革委会常委下去后，没有蹲在下一级革委会机关里，而是一下到底，扎根到群众之中，使自己的思想直接和群众见面，自觉地接受群众的监督，并虚心倾听群众的呼声，把群众的意见、要求、愿望反映上来，使新生的革命委员会永远同群众保持血肉的联系，时刻代表群众的利益，全心全意为人民服务。
    革命群众代表、革委会常委林云喜下到南岔区以后，区革委会的同志给她准备了一个办公室，但是她没有把自己的行李搬到办公室里，而是到一家贫农老大娘杨秀田那里落户。她把自己的书包当成办公桌，走到那里就在那里工作，和广大革命群众保持密切的联系。她放手发动群众，大办家庭毛泽东思想学习班，深挖暗藏在街道里的阶级敌人，使街道的革命形势越来越好。革委会常委耿广有同志，原来是个年轻的技术员。他到红星区之前，在带不带行李这个问题上有过一段思想斗争。经过学习毛主席有关群众路线的教导，使他认识到：带不带行李是问题的现象，根子往办公室里扎，还是往群众里扎，则是问题的本质。认识提高以后，他除了参加区革委会常委会研究重大问题外，就背着行李下到林场，虚心听取群众意见，和群众一道干革命。在深入基层两个月的时间内，他主动地向革命群众征求五次意见，斗私批修，促进思想革命化。老工人、市革委会副主任陈荣玉经过两个多月的亲身实践，深深地体会到：人下去，思想也要下去。只有这样，我们和群众的心才能连在一起，贴得更紧，我们在群众中间扎根才能扎深扎牢。
    是长期深入群众，还是做深入群众的“临时工”？
    毛主席教导我们：“我们任何时候都不要离开群众。这样，我们就可能知道群众，了解群众，同群众一道，也就可能好好地为人民服务。”
    在开始下去的时候，部分革命群众代表感到自己没有做过领导工作，水平低，恐怕下去搞不好，完不成组织上交给自己的任务，抱着下去试试看，不行再回来的临时观点，缺乏长期扎根于群众的信心；有的认为常委就是“常”在机关主持日常工作，下去也“蹲”不住，没有长期扎根于群众之中的思想准备。到底能不能“蹲”得住，是长期深入群众，还是做深入群众的“临时工”？他们带着这个问题，向毛主席著作请教。毛主席说：“我们任何时候都不要离开群众。这样，我们就可能知道群众，了解群众，同群众一道，也就可能好好地为人民服务。”他们用毛主席这一教导，对比中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的到群众中去捞取升官发财的政治资本的黑货，深深地认识到，只有遵照毛主席的指示去做，才能树立起“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的思想。是密切联系群众，还是脱离群众？这是两条路线斗争在我们头脑中的反映，实质上是要革命，还是要做“官”的问题。照不照毛主席的指示去做，这是考验我们对毛主席忠不忠的大问题。
    在解决了认识问题之后，不论是下去代职的常委还是下去蹲点的常委，除了十分必要参加会议回市以外，都在基层“蹲”得很稳，扎扎实实地和群众一起闹革命。他们同群众一起学习、宣传、落实毛主席的最新指示，狠抓阶级斗争，取得了显著的成效，有力地推动了无产阶级革命派的革命大联合，发展和巩固了革命的三结合，推动了抓革命、促生产。群众反映说：“你们这样干，我们永远信得过。”
    经过这段工作，他们对毛主席的革命路线有了更深刻的理解，在群众中吸取了营养，尝到了甜头，更加坚定了长期扎根于群众之中，永远不脱离群众的决心。有的同志深有体会地说：“只有无限忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，在长期的群众斗争中改造自己、锻炼自己，才能更好地为人民服务。”
    下去以后，以什么样的姿态出现，是甘当群众的小学生，向群众请教？还是将自己置于群众之上？
    毛主席教导我们：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的”，“要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。”
    伊春市革委会的常委们，在下去之前都有一个共同的决心和良好的愿望：向工农兵学习，为工农兵服务，锻炼自己，改造自己，把革命抓上去，把生产促上去。但是，从一些常委下去最初一个阶段的情况看，却反映出一个问题，这就是：下去以后，以什么样的姿态出现于群众之中，是把自己置于群众之中，做群众的小学生，还是把自己置于群众之上？
    革命群众代表（工人）、常委王殿有，回到本厂之后就深入到车间去。他在不到几天的时间里，就走遍了全厂的各个车间、各道工序，并且发表了不少意见。大家对他这种作风很不习惯，有的说：“市里的常委回来指挥来了！”他感到很不对劲，心想：群众咋变了呢？这时，老工人王瑞阳对他说：“殿有啊，我看你这次回来，好象有点变化。”到底是自己有点变化，还是群众有点变化？王殿有带着这个问题反复学习了毛主席的教导：“有许多的东西，只要我们对它们陷入盲目性，缺乏自觉性，就可能成为我们的包袱，成为我们的负担。”他清醒地感到，有点变化的不是群众，而是自己。他觉察到，自己当了常委以后，地位变了，思想上也起了变化，身上滋长了“官气”了。正是因为自己有了这样的变化，所以对群众的态度也有点变。他经过认真地学习毛主席的教导，认识到：有了一分“官气”，和群众的距离就远一步，这就不可能自觉地执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就不可能相信群众、依靠群众、尊重群众的首创精神。路线斗争觉悟提高以后，他感到“群众是真正的英雄”，而自己则是幼稚可笑的。从此，他遇事便同群众商量，拜群众为师，同群众一起抓革命促生产。群众都不再喊他“常委”了，年岁大的叫他“小王”，年岁小的喊他“老王”，同年的都叫他的名字“殿有”。老工人王瑞阳满怀欣喜地说：“你要总是保持这个劲儿呀，那就变不了。要象刚回来那样，那可就不保准了！”
    这件事，引起了常委们的重视。他们在检查和总结领导班子革命化的问题时，都一致感到：下去以后，以什么样的姿态出现于群众之中，这是执行不执行毛主席革命路线的根本态度、根本立场问题。他们认为，资产阶级世界观不彻底改造，虽然已经落脚于群众之中，但不能联系群众、组织群众，更不能相信群众、依靠群众，也就不能自觉地贯彻毛主席的革命路线。他们反复地学习了毛主席的教导：“要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。”决心向群众学习一辈子，全心全意为人民服务一辈子。
