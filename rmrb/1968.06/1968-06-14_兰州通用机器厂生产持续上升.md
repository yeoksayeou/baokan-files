The Revolutionary Committee of Lanzhou General Machinery Factory firmly remembers Chairman Mao's instruction, "Never forget class struggle," and leads the revolutionary workers of the entire factory in fiercely waging class struggle. They deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism and denunciation, driving the factory's production to continuously rise. Since this year, the factory has consecutively completed five months of overfulfilling the state plan, with product quality continuously improving. The cleaning machines produced in April set a new record for the highest production in the factory's history. Since June, the production situation has been getting better and better.

    兰州通用机器厂生产持续上升
    兰州通用机器厂革命委员会牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，带领全厂革命职工，狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，推动全厂生产持续上升。今年以来，连续五个月超额完成国家计划，产品质量不断提高。四月份生产的清腊机，创造了本厂历史上的最高生产纪录。六月以来，生产情况越来越好。
