Editor's Note: Currently, various places in the countryside are entering the busy summer harvest and planting season. How to implement the great leader Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" is a prominent issue facing cadres at all levels and the broad masses of commune members. Comrades from the "Red Guards Militia" of Jiaoqiao in Hai'an County, Jiangsu Province, brought this issue to mind, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and vigorously carried out revolutionary criticism. They criticized China's Khrushchev for opposing the prominence of proletarian politics and advocating "production first." They believe that during the busy season, if one only focuses on production and forgets class struggle, forgets proletarian dictatorship, forgets the prominence of proletarian politics, and forgets holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, one would fall into the trap of China's Khrushchev and be poisoned by the "production first" theory. Their experiences are worth everyone's attention.

The Busier, the More Important It Is to Grasp Class Struggle

The saying goes: "After the summer solstice, for eighteen days, beans and wheat are carried in baskets." The annual busiest summer harvest and planting season has begun. The production season does not wait for anyone, and we must strive to do a good job in production. However, class struggle is even more relentless. We must vigorously carry out the revolution and vigorously promote production to achieve new victories and create new labor feats for the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. China's Khrushchev's "production first" theory is precisely to make us focus on production and not engage in class struggle. Therefore, the busier we are, the more we must criticize the "production first" theory and grasp class struggle.

Looking back to previous years, during the busy season, in some places, class enemies stirred up trouble and disrupted the unity between cadres and the masses; in some places, class enemies spread rumors and incited commune members to go out and engage in free trade; in some places, class enemies sabotaged production and collective property. During the busy season two years ago, a rich peasant element in a certain brigade of our commune said to the hardworking commune members in the fields during the day: "The collective catches a goose, how much can it give you! Why work so hard like a skinny monkey, just take a break!" At night, he went to the threshing ground and stole collective grain, saying maliciously: "I'll make you work hard without tasting anything! I'll make your collective economy become like a rabbit's tail—it won't grow long." During the busy spring plowing and production season this year, a bad element sneaked into our brigade, hiding during the day and coming out at night, playing tricks, attempting to sabotage our revolution and production. Later, the masses exposed and struggled against this scoundrel, and the revolution and production presented a new appearance.

The great teacher Chairman Mao teaches us: "Never forget class struggle." We must always remember Chairman Mao's great teachings and, no matter how busy we are, we must never forget to grasp class struggle.

China's Khrushchev, this thoroughly rotten scoundrel with sores on his head and pus on his feet, blindly spouts: "Class struggle is basically over," and "The main task of the entire people and the party now is to develop productive forces as quickly as possible." Jiang Wǎnqīng, China's Khrushchev's agent in Jiangsu, rushed to our Jiaoqiao, shouting with a voice like a broken gong: "The power is in our hands, no one can take it away, the biggest problem now is to develop production by all means." Enough! Enough! Truly, a dog's mouth can't spit out jade. The evil intentions of China's Khrushchev and his agents, we have long seen from their sneering faces. They frantically advocate the "extinction of class struggle" theory and peddle the "production first" black goods, precisely to corrupt our revolutionary soul, numb our revolutionary will, relax our revolutionary vigilance, and lure us into only grasping production and not the revolution; only grasping the eight hundred and one thousand, but not preventing peaceful evolution; only grasping weeding, but not eliminating traitors; only grasping the management of the third-class seeds, but not the control of the fourth-class elements. In a word, they want to conveniently restore capitalism.

Grass cannot cover the eagle's eye, and water cannot cover the fish's eye. The smoke screen of China's Khrushchev and his agents' "extinction of class struggle" theory and "production first" theory cannot cover the eyes of our militia armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We clearly see that there is class struggle in production, and only by grasping class struggle and the revolution, raising the commune members' socialist consciousness, and eliminating the sabotage of class enemies, can production develop smoothly. In the midst of the victory songs of the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and in the good situation where revolutionary committees are being established at all levels, the summer busy season has begun this year. We must not be complacent or relax our fighting will. We must always observe and study the new trends of class enemies and launch fierce attacks on them steadily, accurately, and fiercely. In the busy production season, the most important thing, the most important thing, is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and grasp class struggle.

### 越忙越要抓阶级斗争

    编者按：当前，各地农村陆续进入夏收夏种大忙。如何贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席制定的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，是各级干部和广大社员群众面临的一个突出问题。江苏省海安县角斜“红旗民兵团”的同志们，带着这个问题，活学活用毛主席著作，狠抓革命大批判，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫反对突出无产阶级政治、鼓吹“生产第一”的罪行。他们认为，大忙季节，只抓生产，忘记阶级斗争，忘记无产阶级专政，忘记突出无产阶级政治，忘记高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，就是上了中国赫鲁晓夫的当，中了“生产第一”论的毒。他们的体会，值得大家重视。
    越忙越要抓阶级斗争
    学习毛主席著作积极分子  角西大队民兵营副教导员  徐桂英
    俗话说：“立夏十八朝，豆麦通担挑。”一年一度最紧张的夏收夏种大忙已经开始了。生产季节不饶人，我们要努力搞好生产。可是，阶级斗争更不饶人。我们必须狠抓革命，猛促生产，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利立新功，建新劳。中国赫鲁晓夫散布的“生产第一”论，正是要我们埋头生产，不搞阶级斗争。因此，我们越忙越要狠批“生产第一”论，狠抓阶级斗争。
    想往年，到大忙季节，有的地方，阶级敌人挑拨离间破坏干群团结；有的地方，阶级敌人造谣惑众，煽动社员外出搞自由买卖；有的地方，阶级敌人破坏生产，破坏集体财产。前年大忙期间，我们公社某大队有个富农分子，白天，到田头煽动积极劳动的社员说：“集体打下一只雁，能派你多少！何苦忙得象个瘦猴子，还是歇歇劲吧！”夜里，他又奔到打麦场上，大肆盗窃集体粮食，并恶狠狠地说：“我叫你们有得忙没得尝！叫你们的集体经济变成兔子的尾巴——长不了。”今年春耕生产大忙期间，有个坏分子窜到我们大队来，白天躲着，夜里出来，装神弄鬼，妄图破坏我们的革命和生产。后来，群众揭发斗争了这个坏蛋，革命和生产出现了崭新的面貌。
    伟大的导师毛主席教导我们：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争。”我们就是要念念不忘毛主席这一伟大教导，千忙万忙，狠抓阶级斗争不能忘。
    中国赫鲁晓夫，这个头顶生疮，脚板流脓——坏到底的家伙，就是闭着眼睛嚼舌头，说什么：“阶级斗争基本结束”，“现在全国人民和党的主要任务，就是尽快地发展生产力。”中国赫鲁晓夫在江苏的代理人江渭清，急急忙忙跑到我们角斜来，扯开破铜锣似的嗓子叫道：“政权在我们手里，谁也拿不去，现在最大的问题是千方百计发展生产。”够了！够了！真是狗嘴里吐不出象牙来。中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的歹毒用心，我们早已从他们呲牙咧嘴的相貌上瞟见了。他们拚命地鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭”论，大肆贩卖“生产第一”的黑货，就是企图腐蚀我们的革命灵魂，麻醉我们的革命意志，放松我们的革命警惕，诱骗我们只抓生产，不抓革命；只抓八百一千，不防和平演变；只抓锄草，不抓除奸；只抓对三类苗的管理，不抓对四类分子的管制。说到天亮一句话，就是好让他们得心应手地复辟资本主义。
    草遮不住鹰眼，水遮不住鱼眼。中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的“阶级斗争熄灭”论和“生产第一”论的烟幕弹，遮不住我们用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的民兵的眼。我们清楚地看到，生产中有阶级斗争，而抓好了阶级斗争，抓好了革命，提高了社员的社会主义觉悟，杜绝了阶级敌人的破坏，生产才能顺利发展。在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，在各级革命委员会纷纷建立的大好形势下，今年的夏季大忙已经开始了，我们丝毫不能麻痹轻敌，绝对不能松懈战斗意志。我们要时刻观察、研究阶级敌人的新动向，又稳又准又狠地向阶级敌人发动猛攻。在生产大忙中，千重要，万重要，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，狠抓阶级斗争最重要。
