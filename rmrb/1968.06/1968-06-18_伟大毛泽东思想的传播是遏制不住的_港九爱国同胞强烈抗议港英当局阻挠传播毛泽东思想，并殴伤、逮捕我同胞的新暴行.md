The Hong Kong and Kowloon patriotic compatriots have strongly protested against the new atrocities committed by the Hong Kong British authorities in obstructing the spread of Mao Zedong Thought and assaulting and arresting our compatriots.

New China News Agency, Hong Kong, June 16th — In recent nights, the Hong Kong British authorities have dispatched large numbers of armed police to provoke and attack compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon who were studying, propagating Mao Zedong Thought, and resting in public parks, docks, and other public places. They have beaten and arrested many compatriots, deliberately violating the rights of Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, which has aroused great indignation among the compatriots.

In the past month, some patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong have used their evening rest time to study and propagate Mao Zedong Thought in the Longshan Bay Road Sports Ground and the Hung Hom Dock in Kowloon. They have told revolutionary stories and sung revolutionary songs, which have been welcomed by the broad masses. The Hong Kong British authorities are terrified and enraged by this. To suppress the spread of Mao Zedong Thought, on the night of the 11th, they dispatched large numbers of fully armed police to the above-mentioned two places. They used tear gas, rubber bullets, and poisonous liquids against the people present, killing several people on the spot. Three compatriots were injured and then unreasonably arrested.

On the nights of the 13th and 14th, the Hong Kong police again took massive action, returning to the Longshan Bay Road Sports Ground. They savagely beat and drove away compatriots who were studying and propagating Mao Zedong Thought in the park, and unreasonably arrested more than twenty compatriots, subjecting them to political persecution.

Recently, the Hong Kong British authorities have also resorted to various tricks and repeatedly dispatched police to threaten with violence, attempting to obstruct and sabotage the just actions of Hong Kong and Kowloon workers to return to work.

The Hong Kong and Kowloon Anti-British Persecution Struggle Committee of All Circles and the Hong Kong and Kowloon Anti-British Persecution Struggle Committee of All Industries issued statements on the 14th and 15th respectively, strongly protesting against the new atrocities committed by the Hong Kong British authorities. The statement of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Anti-British Persecution Struggle Committee of All Circles pointed out: The Hong Kong British authorities actually dared to accuse compatriots of "illegal assembly" for using their evening rest time to sing revolutionary songs and other legitimate activities in the park. "This once again exposed their malicious intention to oppose the Chinese people and obstruct the spread of Mao Zedong Thought." The statement solemnly pointed out that up to now, the Hong Kong British authorities have not accepted the five solemn demands proposed by our government a year ago and the reasonable demands proposed by the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon on many occasions. They have not released the patriotic compatriots who were unreasonably imprisoned, and they have not stopped persecuting the compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. In more than a year, you have accumulated enough old debts. We have recorded each one of these debts, and you cannot escape them. The statement said, now, you have committed a series of new atrocities, and we will settle accounts with you thoroughly.

The statement of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Anti-British Persecution Struggle Committee of All Industries said, the Hong Kong British authorities claim to be willing to ease the situation in Hong Kong and improve Sino-British relations, but in reality, they are continuously carrying out crazy suppression against our patriotic workers and compatriots. The statement solemnly warns the Hong Kong British authorities: If you insist on carrying out this reactionary policy and deliberately create tension, worsening the situation in Hong Kong, then you must bear all the serious consequences that arise from this.

    伟大毛泽东思想的传播是遏制不住的
    港九爱国同胞强烈抗议港英当局阻挠传播毛泽东思想，并殴伤、逮捕我同胞的新暴行
    新华社香港十六日电  港英当局最近一连数晚派出大批武装警察，向在公园、码头空地等一些公共活动地点学习、宣传毛泽东思想和休息的港九同胞进行挑衅，并殴伤、逮捕我同胞多人，蓄意侵犯港九同胞宣传毛泽东思想的权利，激起了港九同胞的极大愤慨。
    最近一个月来，香港一些爱国同胞利用晚上休息时间，在九龙长沙湾道球场公园和红磡码头空地，学习、宣传毛泽东思想，讲革命故事和唱革命歌曲，受到广大群众的欢迎。港英当局对此怕得要死，恨得要命，为了遏制毛泽东思想的传播，于十一日晚上派出大批全副武装的警察，前往上述两地，用催泪弹、木弹枪、毒液等对付在场的群众，当场打死多人，三名同胞在被打伤后又遭无理拘捕。
    十三日和十四日晚上，港英警察又接连大举出动，再次到长沙湾道球场公园，野蛮殴打、驱逐正在公园内学习和宣传毛泽东思想的群众，并无理拘捕了二十多名同胞，对他们进行政治迫害。
    最近以来，港英当局还耍弄各种阴谋诡计，并连续派出警察悍然以暴力进行威胁，妄图阻挠和破坏港九罢工工人进行复工的正义行动。
    港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会和港九各业工人反对港英迫害斗争委员会十四、十五两日分别发表声明，强烈抗议港英当局的新暴行。港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会的声明指出：港英当局竟敢把同胞们利用晚上休息时间在公园内演唱革命歌曲等正当活动诬为“非法集会”，“这就再一次暴露了它敌视中国人民和阻遏毛泽东思想传播的恶毒居心”。声明严正指出，直到现在，港英当局还没有接受一年前我国政府提出的五项严正要求和港九爱国同胞历次提出的合理要求，还没有释放被无理囚禁的爱国同胞，还没有停止对港九同胞的迫害。一年多来，你们欠下的旧债已经够多的了。这些债，我们都一件件地记录在案，你们是赖不掉的。声明说，现在，你们又制造了一连串新的暴行，我们要彻底清算。
    港九各业工人反对港英迫害斗争委员会的声明说，港英当局口里说什么愿意和缓香港局势，改善中英邦交，而实际上却不断对我爱国工人、同胞进行疯狂的镇压。声明严正警告港英当局：假如你们还是一意孤行地执行这种反动政策，蓄意制造紧张，恶化香港局势，那么你们就必须承担由此而引起的一切严重后果。
