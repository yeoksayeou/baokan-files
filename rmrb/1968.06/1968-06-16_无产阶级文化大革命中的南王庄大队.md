On the vast plains of Hebei Province lies an ordinary village—South Wang Village Production Brigade of Anping County. The tremendous changes that have taken place in this village over the past two years vividly demonstrate the immense power of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the brilliant radiance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

In this ordinary village on the Hebei plains, there live three impoverished peasants—Wang Yuku, Wang Xiaoji, and Wang Xiaopang—whom the great leader Chairman Mao praised as representing the "direction of the 500 million peasants." In 1955, the great leader Chairman Mao wrote in his brilliant work "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation": "In Hebei Province, there is a very small cooperative with only six households. Three households of middle peasants decided not to continue, and they were allowed to leave; three households of poor peasants, however, insisted on continuing, and they were allowed to stay. The cooperative's organization was thus preserved. In fact, the direction represented by these three households of poor peasants is the direction of the 500 million peasants nationwide. All individual peasant households will ultimately follow the path that these three households of poor peasants have resolutely chosen." Chairman Mao's great voice greatly inspired the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to walk the socialist path with confidence and determination. By 1956, China had achieved agricultural collectivization. At that time, Wang Yuku, representing the 500 million peasants, handed over the good news of their collective path to the great leader Chairman Mao and was personally received by Chairman Mao. Over the past decade, South Wang Village Production Brigade has grown from a small cooperative of three households of poor peasants to a village-wide cooperative, and later to a people's commune, growing and strengthening on the broad road of socialism and in the storms of class struggle.

Today, after the tumultuous Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the face of South Wang Village has been completely transformed. The poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres have directed their struggle against Liu Shaoqi and his agents, carrying out a deep and sustained revolutionary criticism, promoting the widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought, and driving the revolutionization of people's thinking. The relationship between people has undergone new changes.

Fiercely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the extinction of class struggle," wholeheartedly following the red sun

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the world, there is no love without reason, nor is there hatred without reason." Who to love, who to hate, who to be close to, who to be distant from—different classes and different standpoints have different standards.

The cooperative started by the three households of poor peasants, under the warm care of the great leader Chairman Mao, passed through Liu Shaoqi's "massive chopping of cooperatives" and later, under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, fought against Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, step by step, growing and strengthening. They love Chairman Mao the most, love Mao Zedong Thought the most, and hate Liu Shaoqi and his agents the most. From their personal experiences, they deeply understand that Liu Shaoqi and a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party represent the interests of the Kuomintang reactionaries, imperialism, the bourgeoisie, and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and are the sworn enemies of the proletariat and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

During the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of South Wang Village Production Brigade, with boundless love for Chairman Mao and deep hatred for Liu Shaoqi, took Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, fiercely criticizing Liu Shaoqi and a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres angrily said that Liu Shaoqi vigorously propagates the "theory of the extinction of class struggle." In South Wang Village, after agricultural collectivization, the landlords and rich peasants followed suit, saying things like, "The land is public now, everyone eats by earning work points, so why talk about class?" "Blood is thicker than water, neighbors are closer, family members stick together, so why talk about class?" Has class struggle really been extinguished? No! After achieving collectivization, South Wang Village has undergone three major rounds of struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads. Each round was a struggle to overthrow the capitalist system, and each time it was because this bunch of bad elements wanted to restore capitalism. Liu Shaoqi was always their black backer. This bunch of bad elements, each time, used names and relationships like "this village, that village," "east side, west side," "Zhang surname, Li surname," "relatives, friends" to confuse class lines and launch savage attacks on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, attempting to seize power from the poor and lower-middle peasants who insist on the socialist direction.

The first round was during the period of temporary economic difficulties in 1960. Liu Shaoqi, in collusion with the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries' anti-China chorus, maliciously attacked the Three Red Banners and vigorously promoted "four freedoms" and "three selfs and one package," among other things. This black wind blew into South Wang Village, and the untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in South Wang Village Production Brigade all came out. A rich peasant openly spread the erroneous theories of "contracting production to households," "contracting work to teams," and "feeding livestock by household" on the streets, saying things like, "Other villages and cooperatives do it this way, so our village and brigade should do it this way too." The poor and lower-middle peasant members immediately questioned him: "In other villages and cooperatives, who did this? It was you landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who wanted to destroy the socialist collective economy that did this!" The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants exposed the enemy's tricks and resisted the black wind Liu Shaoqi had stirred up.

The second round was during the period of the great socialist education movement in 1964. Liu Shaoqi and his agents actively promoted the "Peach Garden Experience" of fake "four cleans" and true restoration, indiscriminately attacking cadres. The landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists took the opportunity to stir up trouble, shouting things like, "The west side of the village has more cadres, and the east side suffers from the west side." They used this to deceive the masses, incite sectarian disputes, and carry out class revenge. They also incited members to demand more private plots, steal collective tools, cut down collective trees, and sabotage the collective economy. The great document "Twenty-three Articles," personally drafted by Chairman Mao with great historical significance, armed the minds of the poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants of the east and west sides of the village united, stood together against the enemy, and once again foiled the enemy's attack, defending the socialist direction and strengthening proletarian dictatorship.

The third round was during this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Liu Shaoqi and his agents actively promoted the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large area and protecting a small number," and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in South Wang Village Production Brigade again attempted to seize power and rebel. They raised the banner of "rebellion," fiercely attacking Wang Yuku, Wang Xiaoji, and Wang Xiaopang, who held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely walked the socialist path. They even organized some members with low political awareness and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, using the pretext of "telling bitterness" to attack socialism and proletarian dictatorship. The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought saw through their evil plots, exposed their heinous crimes, and used them as negative examples, fiercely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's reactionary fallacies like the "theory of the extinction of class struggle."

During the revolutionary criticism, many poor and lower-middle peasants told their stories of bitterness, citing numerous facts from the old society where the poor were united, and exposing the enemy's tricks of using sectarian struggles like "east side, west side," "one family, one surname" to cover up the essence of class struggle and carry out class revenge. This raised the class consciousness and two-line struggle awareness of the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres. Wang Yuku firmly told those who stirred up sectarian disputes and wanted him to rely on his own clan and relatives: "Who are our own people? Those who are loyal to Chairman Mao are our own people, those who walk the socialist path are our own people. Succession is not about succeeding the same clan and relatives, but about succeeding Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Such people are the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause." The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants spat on the decayed old ideas of "this village, that village," "east side, west side," "Zhang surname, Li surname," "relatives, friends," and united under the banner of class, under the banner of loyalty to Chairman Mao, all rallying to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, quickly achieving revolutionary unity, and establishing a revolutionary three-in-one leadership team. Now, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants handle relationships between people with one standard: those who are loyal to Chairman Mao are close, those who oppose Chairman Mao are enemies!

Using the "Three Articles" to break private thoughts and establish public spirit, the light of collectivism shines

South Wang Village is located on the old course of the Hutuo River. Before liberation, it was known as "South Wang Village White Sand Beach, where the wind blows and the sky is not seen, year after year of hard work, generation after generation of suffering." Agricultural collectivization changed the natural landscape here. Today's South Wang Village has become a place with forests and irrigation networks, and the 3,000 mu of previously barren sandy land has been transformed into a stable, high-yielding field with double insurance against drought and flood. The days of the socialist big family are getting better and better, and the collective path is becoming wider and wider.

To raise the socialist awareness of the poor and lower-middle peasants and the masses, and to better establish the idea of farming for the revolution, in 1963, Wang Yuku went to Dazhai Brigade in Shanxi to learn from the self-reliant revolutionary spirit of the people of Dazhai, who have a heart for the motherland. After returning, he further strengthened ideological and political work, using Mao Zedong Thought to educate members and cadres to be selfless. However, Liu Shaoqi and his agents fiercely opposed learning Mao Zedong Thought, opposed emphasizing proletarian politics, and stubbornly promoted their "three guarantees and one reward," "high reward and heavy punishment," "material incentive," and "work points in command" black goods. They also used Liu Shaoqi's "private character" book—Black "Cultivation"—to spread poison everywhere. Their goal was to "keep the private heart" to restore capitalism.

The world-shaking Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution defeated Liu Shaoqi and his agents, making Mao Zedong Thought widely disseminated as never before. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses set up various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works, using the brilliant thoughts from the "Three Articles" as weapons, fiercely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's entire counter-revolutionary revisionist line and his decadent philosophy of life of "suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage." They sparked a revolution in their souls, purging all private thoughts, and establishing the idea of farming for the revolution and the selfless worldview of the proletariat.

The "five-guarantee" household Zhang Kuiyuan studied Chairman Mao's works in struggle and used them in struggle, using the mirror of "completely selfless and dedicated to the people" to examine himself, and the ruler of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people to measure himself, establishing the idea of farming for the revolution. In the past, he would carry manure home; now, he silently dumps it on the brigade's manure pile. He takes care of the brigade's trees, getting up early and returning late, going wherever they are, diligently and responsibly. He is sixty-nine years old, but he says, "I am only three years old, because in these three years, I have established the thought of 'completely' and 'thoroughly' serving the people." Therefore, people call him the "three-year-old new person"!

The "Red Machinery Team" is another example. In the past, some machine operators had the idea of operating machines for work points. In the past two years, they have actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works, fiercely criticizing Liu Shaoqi and a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party's "work points in command," "material incentive," and "technology first" revisionist black goods, establishing the idea of operating machines for the revolution, and striving to do more, better, faster, and more economically in their work. They used their brains and hands to repair more than ten discarded parts and also created the "drip oil-saving method" for diesel engines, saving two and a half ounces of diesel per hour per machine, increasing the speed by six hundred revolutions, and producing ten tons more water. Many people from outside the village came to visit and learn.

The livestock breeders used Mao Zedong Thought to pull out the poisonous needle of "material incentive," and the livestock breeding work presented a new situation. In the past, both reproduction and preservation of livestock implemented high rewards. This method encouraged the private thoughts of breeders and other members, but the livestock breeding work was not done well. During the Cultural Revolution, they criticized the revisionist black goods of "material incentive," abolished the high reward system, emphasized proletarian politics, and turned into everyone caring for and preserving livestock. Last year, they reproduced twenty-one foals and colts, the best year in the history of this brigade for reproduction and preservation of livestock. The members said: "After pulling out the poisonous needle of 'material incentive,' the direction is clear, the enthusiasm is high, and the trough is prosperous."

As people's worldviews change, so do the relationships between people. The phenomenon of disputes between people and brigades due to their own interests has disappeared, replaced by the communist style of "mutual concern, mutual love, and mutual help," and "completely selfless and dedicated to the people." During the drought relief period last year, the neighboring village of Ma Family Brigade had wells but no machines and could not irrigate the fields. South Wang Village Brigade took people and machines to help them. The members said: "If their fields cannot be planted, it harms the common interests of the state and the collective, and we should go to help." When an outside brigade encountered technical difficulties in brick kilns, the sixty-six-year-old kiln technician Wang Zhanyuan of South Wang Village Brigade went from village to village to help, without asking for payment. He said: "Dr. Bethune is a foreigner who came to China from afar to help the revolution. What is so great about me contributing this little effort!"

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses thus took the "Three Articles" as their motto, fought against private thoughts and revisionism, and selflessly built new relationships between people.

Cadres and masses are heart to heart, turning the countryside into a school of Mao Zedong Thought

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has promoted the establishment of a fish-water relationship between cadres and the masses. Cadres and the masses walk the same path, share the same heart, with a heart of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, jointly defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

In 1955, the great leader Chairman Mao pointed out in the postscript of the book "The Socialist High Tide in China's Countryside": "This cooperative of three households of poor peasants has had a great influence in the rural areas of the entire country over the past few months. Everyone knows that there is such a remarkable and heroic cooperative in Hebei Province, which has given the poor peasants courage." In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the heroic "three households of poor peasants" have remembered Chairman Mao's great teachings, charging into the fierce struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, and once again giving courage to the poor and lower-middle peasants of the entire county. Wang Yuku firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, directing fierce fire at Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the province, region, and county. He traveled to all nineteen communes in the county, mobilizing the masses to carry out sustained revolutionary criticism, propagating Chairman Mao's great calls of "grasp revolution, promote production" and "support the army and love the people," and establishing a close relationship with the broad revolutionary masses. The revolutionary masses elected him into the provincial, municipal, county, and commune revolutionary committees and the brigade revolutionary leadership team. Wang Yuku, holding five levels of revolutionary leadership positions, always remembered Chairman Mao's teaching of "being both an 'official' and a common person," and when he returned home, he would work and study with the members whenever he had time. The young pioneer Liu Xintan said: "The poor peasant nature and hardworking spirit of the 'three households of poor peasants' are examples that we young people should always learn from."

The newly born revolutionary leadership team of South Wang Village Brigade includes Liu Xintan, Liu Mingjun, and Shang Wazi, who are daring, revolutionary, and hardworking young people. They are all good successors of the poor and lower-middle peasants and have grown and strengthened in the great struggle of the Cultural Revolution. They come from the masses and live among the masses. After Shang Wazi, the son of a poor peasant, was elected into the brigade revolutionary leadership team, he followed Chairman Mao's teachings and never left the masses. This year, in response to Chairman Mao's great call to "definitely control the Haihe River," he led the workers to the Haihe River construction site. He and the workers actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works, worked hard, and completed the river control task well. He also carried forward the communist style, breaking down village, commune, and county boundaries, taking the lead in removing the ridges left by the construction, and filling in the ditches. The workers all praised him as a good leader chosen by the masses.

The brigade's revolutionary leadership team strives to take "unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, unlimited loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line" as their action guidelines. If anyone's speech, actions, or work style does not conform to Chairman Mao's teachings, everyone will criticize and help them.

Cadres believe in the masses, and the masses protect the cadres. The team leader of the third team, Wang Jiuwu, is a good team leader of the poor and lower-middle peasants. The class enemies regard him as a thorn in their eye and have caused trouble for him five times. He once thought of not being a cadre anymore. However, the revolutionary masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought believed in him, supported him, and firmly stood with him, exposing the class enemies who carried out sabotage activities, giving him support, and being his backbone. Wang Jiuwu was deeply educated, believing in the masses more, relying on the masses, firmly grasping the reins of power, and better serving the people.

The changes in South Wang Village reflect that the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is ruthlessly destroying the old ideology, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes. The ideological foundation for Liu Shaoqi's restoration of capitalism—"selfishness"—has been thoroughly purged.

Under the guidance of the radiant Mao Zedong Thought, people are rapidly changing their spiritual outlook. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses in our country are turning the countryside into a red Mao Zedong Thought school in the blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    无产阶级文化大革命中的南王庄大队
    河北大平原上一个普通的村庄——安平县南王庄公社南王庄大队在两年来无产阶级文化大革命中的巨大变化，生动地显示了毛主席无产阶级革命路线的无比威力，显示了战无不胜的毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉。
    在河北平原上这个普通的村庄里，住着伟大领袖毛主席称赞为代表着“五亿农民的方向”的三户贫农王玉坤、王小其、王小庞。一九五五年，伟大领袖毛主席在《关于农业合作化问题》这篇光辉著作里写道：“河北省有一个很小的合作社只有六户，三户老中农坚决不想再干下去，结果让他们走了；三户贫农则表示无论如何要继续干下去，结果让他们留下，社的组织也保存了。其实，这三户贫农所表示的方向，就是全国五亿农民的方向。一切个体经营的农民，终归是要走这三户贫农所坚决地选择了的道路的。”毛主席的伟大声音，极大地鼓舞着广大贫下中农走社会主义道路的信心和决心。到一九五六年，我国就实现了农业合作化。当时，王玉坤同志曾经代表着全国五亿农民，把他们走上集体化道路的喜报递交到伟大领袖毛主席的手里，并且受到了毛主席的亲切接见。十几年来，南王庄大队由三户贫农的小社，发展到全村合作，后来又成立了人民公社，在社会主义的广阔大道上，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中成长壮大起来。
    如今，经过汹涌澎湃的无产阶级文化大革命的考验和锻炼，南王庄的面貌更是焕然一新。贫下中农、革命群众和革命干部，把斗争的矛头对准中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人，深入持久地开展革命大批判，促进了毛泽东思想大普及，推动着人的思想革命化，人和人的关系发生了新的变化。
    狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，一心向着红太阳
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。”恨谁，爱谁，疏谁，亲谁，不同的阶级，不同的立场，有着不同的标准。
    三户贫农办起来的合作社，在伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀下，闯过了中国赫鲁晓夫“大砍合作社”的一关，以后又在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，同中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线作斗争中一步一步地发展起来。他们最爱毛主席，最爱毛泽东思想，最恨中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人。他们从自己的切身经历中深刻地认识到，中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派，代表着国民党反动派、帝国主义、资产阶级和地、富、反、坏、右的利益，是无产阶级和广大贫下中农的死对头。
    在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，南王庄大队的贫下中农和革命干部，怀着对毛主席的无限热爱，对中国赫鲁晓夫的深仇大恨，以毛泽东思想为武器，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派的反革命修正主义路线。贫下中农和革命干部愤怒地说，中国赫鲁晓夫拚命宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭”论，南王庄的地主、富农在农业合作化后，跟着唱一个调子，说什么“土地归公了，同样挣工分吃饭，还分什么阶级？”“亲是本族亲，近是邻居近，自家人向着自家人，还分什么阶级？”阶级斗争真的熄灭了吗？没有！南王庄在实现合作化以后，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大搏斗就进行了三个大的回合。每一个回合，都是地、富、反、坏、右要翻天，都是因为这帮坏家伙要复辟资本主义。中国赫鲁晓夫，每次都是这帮坏家伙的黑后台。这帮坏家伙，每次都是用“这村，那村”、“东头，西头”、“张姓，李姓”、“亲戚，朋友”这些名义和关系，来混淆阶级阵线，向毛主席的无产阶级革命路线猖狂进攻，向坚持社会主义方向的贫下中农夺权。
    第一个回合，是一九六○年我国经济暂时困难时期，中国赫鲁晓夫配合帝、修、反的反华大合唱，恶毒攻击三面红旗，大肆鼓吹“四大自由”、“三自一包”等等。这阵阵黑风刮到了南王庄，南王庄大队的没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子纷纷出笼。有个富农分子公开在大街上散布“包产到户”、“包工到组”、“牲口分户喂养”等单干谬论，胡说什么“外村外社这么办了，咱村咱队也该这么办。”贫下中农社员当场质问他：“外村外社是什么人这么办了？是你们这些地、富、反、坏、右分子妄想搞垮社会主义集体经济，才这么办的！”广大贫下中农戳穿了阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，顶住了中国赫鲁晓夫刮起的这股黑风。
    第二个回合，是一九六四年进行伟大的社会主义教育运动时期，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人积极推行假四清、真复辟的“桃园经验”，对干部不分青红皂白，无情打击。地、富、反、坏、右分子乘机活动，大喊大叫什么“（村的）西头干部多，东头受西头的气。”借以蒙蔽群众，挑动宗派纠纷，进行阶级报复。他们还煽动社员多分自留地，偷盗集体农具，砍伐集体树木，破坏集体经济。毛主席亲自主持制定的具有伟大历史意义的纲领性文献“二十三条”，武装了贫下中农的头脑。村东头和西头的贫下中农团结起来，一致对敌，又一次粉碎了阶级敌人的进攻，保卫了社会主义方向，加强了无产阶级专政。
    第三个回合，是这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命。中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人积极推行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，南王庄大队的地、富、反、坏、右分子又妄想夺权翻天。他们打着“造反”的旗号，大反高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗、坚定地走社会主义道路的王玉坤、王小其、王小庞三户贫农，甚至猖狂地组织一些思想觉悟不高的社员和地、富、反、坏、右分子，以所谓“诉苦”为名，攻击社会主义，攻击无产阶级专政。用毛泽东思想武装起来的贫下中农和革命群众，识破了他们的恶毒阴谋，揭露了他们的滔天罪行，把他们当作反面教员，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论等反动谬论。
    在革命的大批判中，许多贫下中农诉了苦，举出在旧社会里，天下穷人是一家，兄弟亲不如阶级亲的大量事实，戳穿了阶级敌人利用“东头西头”、“一家一姓”等宗派斗争来掩盖阶级斗争实质，进行阶级报复的鬼花招，提高了革命群众和革命干部的无产阶级的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟。王玉坤坚定地对那些挑动宗派纠纷，要他依靠同姓同族的“自己人”的人说：“什么是自己人？忠于毛主席的人就是自己人，走社会主义道路的人就是自己人。接班，不是接同姓同族的班，是要接毛泽东思想的班，接毛主席无产阶级革命路线的班，这样的人才是无产阶级革命事业的接班人。”广大贫下中农唾弃了“这村，那村”、“东头，西头”、“张姓，李姓”、“亲戚，朋友”这些腐朽的旧观念，在阶级下面连心，在对毛主席的“忠”字下面站队，都集合到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，迅速实现了革命大联合，成立了革命三结合的领导班子。现在，广大贫下中农处理人和人的关系，就是一条标准：谁忠于毛主席就和谁亲，谁反对毛主席就和谁拚！
    用“老三篇”破私立公，集体主义思想放光芒
    南王庄位于滹沱河故道，解放前被人称为“南王庄白沙滩，刮起风来不见天，年年种地年年苦，祖祖辈辈受熬煎。”农业集体化改变了这里的自然面貌。现在的南王庄，已经成了树木成林、渠道成网的好地方，三千亩原先“种一葫芦收半瓢”的破沙地，变成了旱涝双保险的稳产高产田。社会主义大家庭的日子蒸蒸日上，集体化的道路越走越宽广。
    为了提高贫下中农和社员群众的社会主义觉悟，使大家更好地树立起为革命种田的思想，一九六三年王玉坤同志来到了山西大寨大队参观，学到了大寨人自力更生、胸怀祖国的革命精神。回来后，他就进一步加强思想政治工作，用毛泽东思想教育社员、干部一心为公。但是，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人，疯狂地反对学习毛泽东思想，反对突出无产阶级政治，顽固地推行他们那一套“三包一奖”、“高奖重罚”、“物质刺激”、“工分挂帅”等黑货，还利用中国赫鲁晓夫的那本“私”字经——黑《修养》，到处散布毒素。他们的目的就是要“留得私心在”，好复辟资本主义。
    震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命，把中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人打得落花流水，使毛泽东思想得到空前大普及。广大贫下中农和革命群众，大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，活学活用毛主席著作，用“老三篇”中的光辉思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的一整套反革命修正主义路线和他的“吃小亏占大便宜”的腐朽人生哲学，在灵魂深处爆发革命，荡涤一切私心杂念，树立为革命种田的思想，树立一心为公的无产阶级世界观。
    “五保户”张奎元，对伟大领袖毛主席的著作在斗争中学，在斗争中用，用“毫不利己专门利人”的镜子照自己，用“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的尺子量自己，树立了为革命种田的思想。过去他拾了粪往家背，现在拾了粪不声不响地倒在队里的粪堆上。他看护队上的树木，早起晚归，那里远往那里转，勤勤恳恳，认真负责。他六十九岁了，可是他说：“我才三岁，因为这三年我才树立了‘完全’、‘彻底’为人民服务的思想。”因此，人们称他为“三岁新人”！
      “红色机务队”是又一个典型。过去，这个队有的机手存在着为挣工分开机器的思想，这两年来，他们活学活用毛主席著作，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派的“工分挂帅”、“物质刺激”、“技术第一”等修正主义黑货，树立了为革命开机器的思想，工作中尽量做到多快好省。他们动脑动手，搞了废件复新十几件，还创造了柴油机“滴水节油法”，一台机器一小时可以节省柴油二两半，转速增加六百转，多出水十吨，不少外地人都前来参观学习。
    饲养员们用毛泽东思想拔掉了“物质刺激”这支毒药针，牲畜饲养工作出现了新面貌。过去，繁畜保畜都实行高奖励，这种办法，助长了饲养员和其他一些社员的私心，而牲畜饲养工作搞得并不好。文化大革命中，他们批判了“物质刺激”的修正主义黑货，取消了高奖励制度，突出了无产阶级政治，变成了人人关心牲口，人人保养牲口。去年一年，光繁殖小骡小马就有二十一匹，是这个大队历史上繁畜保畜最多最好的一年。社员们说：“拔掉了‘物质刺激’这根毒药针，方向明，干劲大，槽头兴旺”。
    人的世界观在转变，人和人的关系也随着在转变。人和人、队与队之间，因各自的利益而发生纠纷的现象不见了，代替的是“互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助”、“毫不利己专门利人”的共产主义风格。去年抗旱时期，邻村马家大队有井没机器，浇不上地。南王庄大队就连人带机器一起去帮助。社员们说：“他们的地种不上，损害的是国家和集体的共同利益，应当去帮助。”外村外大队烧砖窑遇到技术上的困难，南王庄大队六十六岁的烧窑技术工王占元，就这村转到那村去帮助，不要报酬。他说：“白求恩同志是一个外国人，不远万里来到中国帮助革命，我出这点力有什么了不起！”
    广大贫下中农和革命群众，就这样以“老三篇”为座右铭，斗私批修，一心为公，建立了崭新的人与人之间的关系。
    干部群众心连心，把农村办成毛泽东思想大学校
    无产阶级文化大革命，促进干部和群众建立起鱼水相依的关系。干部和群众走一条道，连一颗心，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的一片赤胆忠心，共同捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    伟大领袖毛主席一九五五年在《中国农村的社会主义高潮》一书的按语中指出：“这个三户贫农的合作社，几个月以来，在全国农村中产生了很大的影响，大家都知道河北省有这么一个了不起的英雄的合作社，给贫农壮了胆。”在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，英雄的“三户贫农”，牢记毛主席的伟大教导，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈大搏斗中冲锋陷阵，又一次给全县贫下中农壮了胆。王玉坤同志坚决地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，对准中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本省、本地区、本县的代理人猛烈开火。他跑遍了全县十九个公社，发动群众持久地开展革命大批判，宣传毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”、“拥军爱民”等伟大号召，和广大革命群众建立了血肉相联的密切关系。无产阶级革命派把他选进了省、地、县、社的革命委员会和大队革命领导班子里去。王玉坤身兼五级革命领导机构的工作，但他牢记毛主席的“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的教导，回家来一有空就和社员一起劳动，一起学习。青年闯将刘新坦说：“三户贫农”的贫农本色和艰苦奋斗的作风，是我们青年永远应当学习的榜样。
    新生的南王庄大队的革命领导班子中，有刘新坦、刘明军、商娃子这些敢闯敢干敢革命的青年。他们都是贫下中农的好后代，在文化大革命的伟大斗争中锻炼成长起来。他们来自群众中间，又生活在群众中间。贫农的儿子商娃子被选进大队革命领导班子以后，遵照毛主席的教导，一刻也不脱离群众。今年，他响应毛主席“一定要根治海河”的伟大号召，带领民工到海河工地去施工。他和民工一起活学活用毛主席著作，艰苦奋斗，很好地完成了治河任务，还发扬共产主义风格，打破村界、社界、县界，带头挖掉施工遗留下来的界埂，填平洼沟。民工们都赞扬他是群众选出来的好带头人。
    大队的革命领导班子，努力把无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，作为自己行动的准则。有谁的言论、行动、思想作风不符合毛主席的教导，大家就对他进行批评、帮助。
    干部相信群众，群众爱护干部。三队队长王继武是贫下中农的好队长，阶级敌人把他看成眼中钉，先后五次和他捣乱，他曾经想不当干部了。可是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命群众，相信他，支持他，坚定地和他站在一起，揪出了搞破坏活动的阶级敌人，给他撑了腰，做了后盾。王继武深深受到了教育，更加相信群众，依靠群众，牢牢掌握印把子，更好地为人民服务。
    南王庄的变化，反映出伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，正在无情地摧毁着剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，中国赫鲁晓夫赖以复辟资本主义的思想基础——“私”字，受到了空前的涤荡。
    人们在光芒四射的毛泽东思想指引下，正在迅速地改变着自己的精神面貌。我国的广大贫下中农和革命群众，正在无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火中，把农村办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
