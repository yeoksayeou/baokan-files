In accordance with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the revolutionary workers of Weinan Coal Mine in Shaanxi Province have been steadfastly carrying out revolutionary criticism and struggle, launching a fierce offensive against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, including Khrushchev and his local agents, and exposing the handful of class enemies hidden within the revolutionary ranks. This has further consolidated and developed the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. At present, 95% of the units in the entire mine have achieved revolutionary great alliance by system and department. Seven out of the eight major mines have established revolutionary committees, and the Weinan Coal Mine Revolutionary Committee has also been recently established.

Weinan Coal Mine is the largest coal production base in Shaanxi Province. Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a handful of diehard capitalist-roaders, who had long been sheltered by Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, along with traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries, have employed various counter-revolutionary tricks to sow discord among the workers' organizations, promote counter-revolutionary economism and anarchism, sabotage the revolutionary great alliance, and disrupt production. They attempted to use these methods to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and save their doomed fate. The broad revolutionary workers, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have engaged in a resolute struggle against them and achieved one victory after another.

Recently, our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution under the conditions of socialism, a revolution by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the broad revolutionary masses under its leadership and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Under the guidance of this great instruction by Chairman Mao, the revolutionary workers of Weinan Coal Mine have analyzed the new trends, new characteristics, and new problems of the current class struggle, actively launched a fierce offensive against the class enemies, and carried out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism. They have exposed one by one the hidden traitors, spies, diehard capitalist-roaders, and counter-revolutionaries. Many miners said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest.' We were unable to unite in the past because a handful of class enemies were engaged in sabotage activities. We must not only expose them organizationally but also politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and thoroughly criticize and denounce them. Only in this way can we fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and continuously promote, consolidate, and develop the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination." Many coal mines, following Chairman Mao's teachings on strictly distinguishing between the two types of contradictions, have, through heart-to-heart talks and consultations, correctly handled contradictions among the people, united the broad masses and cadres, and formed a mighty revolutionary army to jointly fight against the enemy. The two major workers' organizations of Hongqi Coal Mine, after having heart-to-heart talks, reached a consensus and jointly exposed a handful of elements who spread reactionary remarks, incited people to fight against each other, and sabotaged the revolutionary great alliance and production. The workers voluntarily formulated a pact to promote revolution and production, ensuring that they would not say or do anything harmful to the revolutionary great alliance.

In carrying out the revolutionary criticism, each coal mine has held Mao Zedong Thought study classes. So far, the entire mine has held over 600 such classes of various types, with more than 35,000 workers participating. Each coal mine has, in the study classes and among the workers, extensively carried out activities of recalling the past and comparing it with the present, and recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness. This has greatly enhanced the revolutionary workers' class struggle consciousness and awareness of the two-line struggle, deepened their hatred for the class enemies, and eliminated differences among the revolutionary workers, strengthening their unity. Some comrades who had previously emphasized "me as the core" and vied for positions in the great alliance said, after hearing the old miners' bitter accounts of the old society, that what "me as the core" meant was entirely "selfishness." If it were not for Chairman Mao personally initiating and leading this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the country would have changed color, and then we would have no status. We would have suffered again. Many leaders of mass organizations, on the basis of enhancing class friendship, have displayed a revolutionary style of mutual concession and assistance, making new contributions to the development and consolidation of the revolutionary great alliance by system and department, and to the promotion of the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

"Class struggle, once grasped, works wonders." The development of the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination has promoted a great leap in production. Since May, the coal output of the entire mine has been steadily increasing. Before and after the establishment of the Weinan Coal Mine Revolutionary Committee, the coal output of each mine has generally increased significantly. At present, the workers of this coal mine are continuing to launch a fierce offensive against the class enemies, further consolidating and developing the revolutionary great alliance by system and department, promoting the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and striving to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    渭北煤矿革命职工认真落实毛主席最新指示
    全矿绝大多数单位按系统、按部门实现了革命的大联合和革命三结合
    新华社西安十三日电　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，陕西省渭北煤矿广大革命职工，坚持开展革命的大批判，向中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派及其在当地的代理人发动猛烈进攻，揪出隐藏在革命队伍内部的一小撮阶级敌人，进一步巩固和发展了革命大联合和革命三结合。现在，全矿已有百分之九十五的单位实现了按系统、按部门的革命大联合，八个大矿中已有七个建立了革命委员会，渭北煤矿革命委员会也在最近诞生了。
    渭北煤矿是陕西省最大的煤炭生产基地。无产阶级文化大革命以来，在中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线长期庇护下的一小撮顽固不化的走资派，以及叛徒、特务和反革命分子，施展各种反革命的伎俩，在职工群众组织之间挑拨离间，大搞反革命经济主义和无政府主义，破坏革命的大联合，破坏生产，妄图以此来破坏无产阶级文化大革命，挽救他们覆灭的命运。广大革命职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同他们进行针锋相对的斗争，取得了一个又一个的胜利。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”在毛主席这一伟大指示的指引下，渭北煤矿广大革命职工分析了当前阶级斗争的新动向、新特点、新问题，主动地向阶级敌人发起猛烈进攻，深入持久地开展革命大批判，把那些隐藏的叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派和反革命分子一个个地揪了出来。许多矿工说，毛主席教导我们：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。”我们过去联合不起来，就是因为一小撮阶级敌人在进行破坏活动。我们不仅要在组织上把他们彻底揭露出来，而且要在政治上、思想上、理论上把他们彻底批倒批臭。只有这样，才能全面落实毛主席的最新指示，不断地促进、巩固和发展革命大联合和革命三结合。许多煤矿按照毛主席严格区分两类不同性质矛盾的教导，通过谈心和协商，正确处理人民内部矛盾，团结广大群众和干部，组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，共同对敌。红旗煤矿的两大职工群众组织经过双方谈心，统一了认识，共同揪出了一小撮散布反动言论、挑动群众斗群众、破坏革命大联合和生产的坏分子。职工们自觉地制定了抓革命、促生产的公约，保证作到不利于革命大联合的话不说，不利于革命大联合的事不做。
    在开展革命的大批判中，各个煤矿都举办了毛泽东思想学习班。到目前，全煤矿已举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班六百多期，参加学习的职工达三万五千多人。各个煤矿在学习班和职工群众中，普遍开展了回忆对比、忆苦思甜的活动，从而大大提高了革命职工的阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争觉悟，加深了他们对阶级敌人的仇恨，同时消除了革命职工之间的分歧，增强了团结。有些同志原来在大联合中总是强调“以我为核心”，争席位，他们听了老矿工对旧社会的血泪控诉以后，都感触很深地说：什么“以我为核心”，完全是“私”字作怪。要不是毛主席亲自发动和领导这场无产阶级文化大革命，国家变了颜色，那时候我们还会有什么地位？我们又要受二遍苦了。不少群众组织的负责人在增强阶级友爱的基础上，发扬互让互助的革命风格，为发展和巩固按系统、按部门的革命大联合，为促进革命的三结合，做出了新的贡献。
    “阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”革命大联合和革命三结合的发展，促进了生产的大发展。五月以来，全矿煤炭产量稳定上升。在渭北煤矿革命委员会成立前后，各矿煤炭产量普遍有了大幅度增长。目前，这个煤矿职工正继续向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，进一步巩固和发展按系统、按部门的革命大联合，促进革命三结合，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而努力奋斗。
