With boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, rural community members eagerly sell summer grain to the state. In Anhui Province, the counties of Changfeng, Taihe, and Mengcheng, as well as the Shandong region of Heze, have exceeded their summer grain procurement targets.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, June 17th—The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Anhui Province, after achieving a bumper harvest of summer crops, followed the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people" and "grain must be tightly controlled." With the greatest revolutionary enthusiasm and the fastest speed, they eagerly sold new grain to the state. By June 14th, three counties in the province—Changfeng, Taihe, and Mengcheng—had exceeded their summer grain procurement targets.

Changfeng, Taihe, and Mengcheng counties have historically been prone to both floods and droughts, making them notorious disaster areas in the province. This year, these three counties took the lead in exceeding their summer grain procurement targets, inspiring other regions greatly.

Currently, the entire province is experiencing a surge in the sale of new grain to the state.

In this year's summer grain procurement work, various levels of revolutionary committees and PLA leftist support personnel have focused on class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. They have organized extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, significantly raising the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines among the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres. With deep love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres correctly handled the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual. They said: "Loyalty to Chairman Mao is shown through action. We must sell grain early, sell good grain, and sell more grain to bring honor to the newly established revolutionary committees."

According to Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, June 17th—The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the Heze region of Shandong Province, with deep love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, actively sold summer grain to the state. By the 14th of this month, the entire region had completed its summer grain procurement targets half a month earlier than previous years and exceeded the targets.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in this region, under the great banner of Chairman Mao's "grasp revolution, promote production," and with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, have worked tirelessly for nearly ten months. They have ensured a bumper harvest of over 560 million mu of wheat. After the wheat harvest, cadres and community members actively sold patriotic grain. They said, "Selling more surplus grain to the state is a manifestation of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and a contribution to supporting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and socialist construction." The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the entire region achieved quick harvesting, quick threshing, and quick selling. Some production teams, to save every second and sell grain quickly, threshed at night and delivered grain during the day. Many counties completed their summer grain selling targets in just three or four days.

In this year's summer grain procurement and distribution work, various levels of revolutionary committees and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the Heze region all firmly remembered Chairman Mao's great instruction of "never forget class struggle." They focused on class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, deeply carried out revolutionary criticism, and greatly promoted the summer grain procurement work.
