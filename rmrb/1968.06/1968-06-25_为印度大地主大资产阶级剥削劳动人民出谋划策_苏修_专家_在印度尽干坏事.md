New Delhi, June 23 (Xinhua) — The Soviet revisionist renegade clique, while providing large amounts of military and economic "aid" to the Indian reactionaries, has recently sent a large number of "experts" to India. These "experts" help the Indian reactionaries ruthlessly enslave and plunder the broad masses of Indian working people, maintaining the reactionary rule of the Indian big landlords and bourgeoisie. This is yet another exposure of the treacherous and scab-like nature of the Soviet revisionist clique.

	According to a recent revelation by the progressive Indian publication "Jammu News," Soviet revisionist "experts" have assisted the Indian reactionaries in investigating the situation of some heavy machinery manufacturing plants operated by the Indian reactionary government. In their investigation report, they took a reactionary bourgeois stance, viciously slandering and attacking the Indian working class, and eagerly whitewashing the Indian big bourgeoisie, offering advice and strategies. They "suggested" in the report that the "responsibility" for operating "state-owned enterprises" (i.e., bureaucrat-capitalist enterprises) be handed over to the management personnel of private enterprises, and demanded the "improvement of labor discipline." Even more shamelessly, they actually proposed that the Indian reactionary government organize yellow unions to serve the capitalists and control the workers.

	Not only in the industrial sector, but also in agriculture and mining, the Soviet revisionists have sent "expert" delegations to advise the Indian reactionaries, intensifying the exploitation of the working people. According to the Indian bourgeois newspaper "The Times of India," last year, the Soviet revisionists sent a delegation of "agricultural experts" led by the deputy minister of the Soviet agricultural department, Vorobyev, to India. They helped the Indian reactionaries implement the so-called "new agricultural policies."

	India's recurring food shortages are the result of the ruthless plunder of the broad masses of peasants by the Indian big landlords and bourgeoisie. However, the Soviet revisionist clique, standing on the side of the Indian landlord class, sent "experts" to advise the Indian reactionaries on how to expand the sowing area of high-yield crops, increase the mechanization level of medium-sized private farms, and develop new varieties, among other things. The "suggestions" of the Soviet revisionist "experts" are entirely aimed at consolidating the feudal land ownership of the Indian landlord class, attempting to enable the Indian landlord class to more ruthlessly exploit the peasants.

	According to another Indian bourgeois newspaper, "The Indian Express," last year, a Soviet revisionist "commercial delegation" visited important mines in the Indian state of Goa. The Soviet delegation, standing on the side of maintaining the evil capitalist exploitation system, discussed with the mining capitalists of Goa how to reduce mining costs, increase production, and earn more foreign exchange. The Soviet delegation advised these mining capitalists that mechanization could greatly reduce mining costs and boasted that the Soviet Union could provide them with the necessary equipment to achieve this goal. The "suggestions" of the Soviet delegation, on the one hand, are to make the Indian mining capitalists intensify the exploitation and plunder of the working class, and on the other hand, to make it convenient for the Soviet revisionist clique to reap benefits from it.

	Sending a large number of "experts" to the Indian reactionary government, helping the Indian big landlords and bourgeoisie intensify the exploitation and plunder of the broad masses of Indian working people, is an important part of the Soviet revisionist clique's policy of pushing new colonialism in India. The Soviet revisionist clique, on the one hand, colludes with the Indian reactionary government to strengthen the exploitation and plunder of Indian workers and peasants, and on the other hand, turns India into a market for its commodities.

	The Soviet revisionists shamelessly boast about their economic "aid" to India as a sign of "friendship" to the Indian people. However, just from the fact that they sent a large number of "experts" to advise the Indian reactionaries on how to oppress and exploit the Indian people, it is enough to prove that the Soviet "aid" to India is entirely aimed at consolidating the reactionary rule of the Indian reactionaries, serving the interests of the Indian landlord class and comprador bureaucratic bourgeoisie, and also serving the shameful purpose of the Soviet revisionist clique's plunder of the Indian people.

	Now, more and more Indian people are gradually seeing through the reactionary nature of Soviet "aid" and realizing that "Soviet aid" and "American aid" are of the same kind. They are becoming increasingly aware and are rising up to fight against the reactionary rule of the Indian reactionaries, who are the running dogs of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists.

### 为印度大地主大资产阶级剥削劳动人民出谋划策  苏修“专家”在印度尽干坏事

    为印度大地主大资产阶级剥削劳动人民出谋划策
    苏修“专家”在印度尽干坏事
    新华社二十三日讯 新德里消息：苏修叛徒集团在给印度反动派大量军事和经济“援助”的同时，最近还派出大批“专家”到印度去，帮助印度反动派残酷地奴役和掠夺印度广大劳动人民，维持印度大地主大资产阶级的反动统治。这是苏修集团的叛徒工贼面目的又一次暴露。
    据印度进步刊物《查谟新闻》不久前揭露，苏修“专家”曾经帮助印度反动派调查印度反动政府经营的一些重型机器制造厂的情况。他们在调查报告中，站在资产阶级的反动立场上，对印度工人阶级进行恶毒的污蔑和攻击，极力为印度大资产阶级涂脂抹粉，出谋献策。他们在报告中“建议”把经营“公营企业”（即官僚资本企业）的“责任”交给私营企业的资方人员，并叫嚷要“整顿劳动纪律”。更为无耻的是，他们竟然要印度反动政府组织为资本家服务的黄色工会来控制工人。
    不但在工业方面，而且在农业和采矿业方面，苏修也派出“专家”代表团为印度反动派出谋划策，加紧剥削劳动人民。据印度资产阶级报纸《印度时报》透露，去年苏修曾派出以苏修农业部副部长沃罗比耶夫率领的“农业专家代表团”去印度，帮助印度反动派推行所谓
  “农业新方针”。
    印度连年不断的粮荒，是印度大地主大资产阶级对广大农民的残酷掠夺所造成的。但是，苏修集团却站在印度地主阶级的立场，派出“专家”向印度反动派“建议”什么扩大高产作物的播种面积、提高中型私人农场的机械化程度以及发展新的品种等等。苏修“专家”的这些“建议”，完全是为巩固印度地主阶级的封建土地所有制服务的，力图使印度地主阶级能够更残酷地剥削农民。
    另据印度资产阶级报纸《印度快报》透露，去年苏修派出的一个“商业代表团”曾访问了印度果阿地区的重要矿山。苏修代表团站在维护罪恶的资本主义剥削制度的立场上，同果阿的矿业资本家讨论如何降低采矿成本、提高产量以换取更多外汇的问题。苏修代表团向这些矿业资本家献策说，只要实行机械化，就可以大大降低采矿成本。并鼓吹说，苏联能够供给他们必要的设备以达到这个目的。苏修代表团的这些“建议”，一方面是要印度矿业资本家加紧对工人阶级的剥削和掠夺，另一方面是使苏修集团便于从中取利。
    向印度反动政府派出大量“专家”，帮助印度大地主大资产阶级加紧剥削和掠夺印度广大劳动人民，这是苏修叛徒集团对印度推行新殖民主义政策的一个重要组成部分。苏修集团一方面同印度反动政府狼狈为奸，加强对印度工人、农民的剥削和掠夺，另一方面使印度成为它的商品销售市场。
    苏修恬不知耻地大吹大擂它对印度的经济“援助”是什么对印度人民的
  “友谊”，但是仅仅从它派出大批“专家”为印度反动派压迫和剥削印度人民出谋划策这一事实来看，就足以证明苏修对印度的“援助”，完全是为巩固印度反动派的反动统治服务的，是为印度的地主阶级和官僚买办资产阶级服务的，也是为苏修叛徒集团自己掠夺印度人民的可耻目的服务的。
    现在，越来越多的印度人民已经逐渐看穿苏修“援助”的反动本质，看穿苏“援”和美“援”是一路货色。他们正在日益觉醒，他们正在起来为推翻美帝、苏修的走狗——印度反动派的反动统治而斗争。
