A massive campaign to learn from Comrade Men He, who is "unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line," is sweeping through the Party committees and cadres at all levels in the PLA's army, navy, and air force. From veteran soldiers with graying hair to young cadres, from revolutionary war heroes who have repeatedly distinguished themselves in battle to cadres on the front lines of "three supports, two militaries," all are earnestly studying Comrade Men He's exalted qualities and heroic deeds of being unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao, unlimitedly loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They point out that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the soul of our Party, the lifeblood of our existence, and the fundamental guarantee of revolutionary victory. Learning from Comrade Men He means to follow his example, to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, to earnestly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, to always stand guard for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, to fight the good fight, and to achieve new victories in the great struggle to win a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

"Once the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor." After the order, personally approved by our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, to confer the honorable title on Comrade Men He was issued, the Party committees of all the general departments, military branches, and units in the PLA first organized all levels of cadres to study. The Party committees of the Beijing, Shenyang, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Chengdu, Fuzhou, and Kunming units took the lead in studying the central command and Comrade Men He's glorious deeds, and then made detailed arrangements for the study of cadres in their subordinate units. Many members of the Lanzhou Military Region Party Committee, at an enlarged meeting of the Party committee, compared themselves with Comrade Men He's deeds, found their shortcomings, and expressed their loyalty. They then promoted the method of "learning from Men He and finding shortcomings" to the cadres in various units. The Jinan Military Region convened a meeting of cadres at all levels, mobilizing everyone to take Comrade Men He as an example, to summarize and review their work. Under the leadership of the Party committee, many units held Mao Zedong Thought study classes with learning from Comrade Men He as the central content. The Navy, Air Force, Xinjiang, and Tibet units sent many leading cadres to grassroots units to study Comrade Men He's glorious deeds with the grassroots cadres and soldiers.

In their studies, cadres at all levels deeply realized that under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the struggle between the two lines is the concentrated expression of class struggle. To be a revolutionary cadre, one must, like Comrade Men He, raise one's consciousness of the struggle between the two lines. At the study and application meetings of Comrade Men He in the Shenyang, Fuzhou, and Kunming units, and at the symposiums in the Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin garrisons, many cadres used their personal experiences to explain that everyone lives in the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, and that everyone is closely related to the struggle between the two lines. Only by constantly raising one's consciousness of the struggle between the two lines can one withstand the storms and waves of class struggle. Zhang Yimin, a Navy active learner of Chairman Mao's works and political commissar of a certain unit, wrote in his study notes that Comrade Men He could see the struggle between the two lines from a play, from a soldier's conversation after returning home, from epaulets, from reports, and from all aspects, and that he firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and launched a fierce attack on the counter-revolutionary revisionist line. This shows that Comrade Men He's consciousness of the struggle between the two lines is very high, and he is truly a good cadre of Chairman Mao in continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must learn from him, arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, constantly raise our consciousness of the struggle between the two lines, and strive for life to execute and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Lin Xiangwu, a political commissar of a certain squadron in the Air Force, was born in the same year as Comrade Men He. In the old society, they both begged for food and carried long-term labor for landlords; they both joined the Party and the army in the same year and are now both political work cadres at the battalion level. He said when finding shortcomings and expressing loyalty, "I will learn from Comrade Men He's exalted virtues of being unlimitedly loyal to the people, unlimitedly loyal to the Party, unlimitedly loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and regard defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line as my lifelong sacred duty."

The vast majority of cadres believe that to have a high consciousness of the struggle between the two lines, one must, like Comrade Men He, be consciously and thoroughly loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. They took Comrade Men He as an example and further carried out the "three loyalties" campaign of being unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao, unlimitedly loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Through praising Chairman Mao's great wisdom, praising the invincible power of Mao Zedong Thought, and praising the great victories of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, cadres at all levels further strengthened their proletarian feelings of unlimited love and loyalty to Chairman Mao. The leading cadres of a certain unit in the Guangzhou Military Region, in order to temper their loyalty to Chairman Mao, went to border and mountain units, and with the soldiers, took Comrade Men He as an example, found the gaps in the "three loyalties," and expressed their determination in the "three loyalties." The entire battalion of the second battalion of a certain unit in the Qinghai Military Region, where Comrade Men He served, pulled bitter herbs from the grasslands and went to the place where Comrade Men He led them to study Chairman Mao's works, ate bitter meals together, denounced the class oppression of the old society, remembered the bitterness of the class, did not forget the blood debt, and raised their simple class feelings to the height of being unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They said: We must, like Comrade Men He, always stand firmly on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, think of Chairman Mao in everything, obey Chairman Mao in everything, follow Chairman Mao in everything, and do everything for Chairman Mao.

In their studies, the vast majority of cadres deeply felt that Comrade Men He could always, firmly, and consciously stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line because he studied Chairman Mao's works with great enthusiasm, combined learning with practice, and truly mastered Mao Zedong Thought. Bai Yunwang, the political department director of the Jinggangshan Military Sub-district in Jiangxi Province, after studying Comrade Men He's deeds, said with deep feelings, "Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is a thoroughly public line. Without a thoroughly public mind, one cannot understand Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and will be afraid to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. I must, like Comrade Men He, diligently study and apply Chairman Mao's works, use Mao Zedong Thought to break down selfishness and establish public spirit, strive to change my worldview, and become a revolutionary fighter who firmly executes and defends Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. After studying Comrade Men He's deeds, Tang Tianshun, deputy director of a certain unit in the Guangzhou Military Region, immediately went down to the company, exposed his selfishness, discussed problems, and studied Chairman Mao's works with the soldiers, asking the soldiers to help him raise his consciousness of the struggle between the two lines. He said, "The more thoroughly one fights selfishness, the more loyal one is to Chairman Mao. Only by thoroughly fighting selfishness and constantly raising one's consciousness of the struggle between the two lines can one firmly execute and bravely defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line."

Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." The vast majority of cadres earnestly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, combined them with Comrade Men He's glorious deeds, and deeply realized that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the most thorough mass line, representing the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the broad masses of the people. Only by closely connecting with the masses, always maintaining the character of the working people, always breathing and sharing destiny with the masses, can one deeply understand and closely follow Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Many veteran cadres with graying hair and young cadres newly promoted to leadership positions took Comrade Men He as an example and went to the companies with backpacks, standing guard and learning with the soldiers. The commander and political commissar of a certain regiment in the Lanzhou Military Region personally led the headquarters cadres with backpacks and banners reading "Learn from Comrade Men He, who is unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line," to the companies, living with the soldiers. Zhang Renjie and Zhuang Shuming demanded of themselves as ordinary soldiers, studying with the soldiers during the day and standing guard with them at night. The leading members of the Party committee of a certain advanced collective in the Guangzhou Military Region, under the leadership of Political Commissar Song Zipei, went to the nearby countryside, eating, living, and working with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and together criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods that China's Khrushchev and his agents promoted in the countryside, further raising their consciousness of the struggle between the two lines.

Learning from Men He means taking action. Cadres at all levels fighting on the front lines of "three supports, two militaries" combined the current new situation of class struggle in their learning from Comrade Men He, raised the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, actively studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, fully implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and achieved new victories in the great struggle to win a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Yuan Ru, the commander of a certain regiment in the Tianjin garrison, was recently performing a left-support task in a factory. The unrepentant capitalist roaders in the factory stirred up a wave of reversing cases, maliciously directing the struggle spearhead at the revolutionary committee of the factory. At this time, Yuan Ru studied Comrade Men He's heroic deeds and, without hesitation, stepped forward, firmly following the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, mobilized the masses to expose the capitalist roaders' plots, and bravely defended the newly born revolutionary committee. Zheng Weifeng, a political commissar of a certain regiment in the Guangzhou Military Region, who is actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and is performing a left-support task in a locality, learned from Men He, found shortcomings, and felt that after becoming a member of a revolutionary committee of a unit, his trust in the masses was not as firm as before, and his reliance on the masses was not as strong as before. He then actively went to the masses, listened to their criticisms, and with the masses, studied Comrade Men He and carried out revolutionary criticism and struggle. He said, "We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, learn from Comrade Men He, always closely connect with the masses, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end."

    解放军各级干部热烈学习门合同志的崇高品质
    象门合那样永远站在毛主席革命路线一边做无产阶级专政条件下继续革命的好干部
    永远和群众同呼吸，共命运，坚决支持无产阶级革命派，在无产阶级文化大革命中立新功
    新华社八日讯　一个规模巨大的向“无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部”门合同志学习的热潮，正在中国人民解放军陆、海、空三军各级党委、各级干部中深入发展着。从鬓发斑白的老红军战士，到年青干部，从革命战争年代屡建功勋的战斗英雄，到“三支”“两军”第一线的各级干部，都在认真地学习门合同志无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的崇高品质和英雄事迹。他们指出，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，是我们党的灵魂，是我们的命根子，是取得革命胜利的根本保证。向门合同志学习，就要象门合同志那样，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，认真落实毛主席的最新指示，时刻为毛主席的革命路线放好哨，站好岗，打好仗，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中，为人民立新功。
    “政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。”伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席亲自批准授予门合同志光荣称号的命令发布以后，中国人民解放军各总部、各军种兵种、各部队党委都首先组织各级干部学习。北京、沈阳、南京、广州、武汉、成都、福州、昆明等部队党委首先带头学习中央命令和门合同志的光辉事迹，然后对所属部队干部的学习作了细致的安排。兰州部队党委许多成员，在党委扩大会上，对照门合同志的事迹，找差距，表忠心，接着把“学门合，找差距”的作法推广到各单位的干部中去。济南部队召开了各级领导干部会，发动大家以门合同志为榜样，总结和检查工作。在党委的领导下，许多部队举办了以学习门合同志为中心内容的毛泽东思想学习班。海军、空军、新疆、西藏等部队许多领导干部分别到基层单位，和基层干部、战士一起学习门合同志的光辉事迹。
    各级干部在学习中，深刻地认识到，在无产阶级专政条件下，两条路线的斗争，是阶级斗争的集中表现。做一个革命干部，必须象门合同志那样，把两条路线斗争觉悟提得高高的。在沈阳、福州、昆明部队的一些学习门合同志的讲用会上，在北京、上海、天津驻军的一些座谈会上，许多干部用自己的切身体会说明，每个人都在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争中生活，每个人都和两条路线斗争息息相关，只有不断提高路线斗争觉悟，才能经得起阶级斗争大风大浪的考验。海军学习毛主席著作积极分子、某部政治委员张逸民，在学习心得笔记中写道，门合同志能从一台鬼戏中，从一个探家归来战士的谈话中，从肩章上、报告词上，从各个方面，看出两条路线的斗争，并且坚决站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，向反革命修正主义路线猛烈开火。这说明门合同志的两条路线斗争觉悟非常高，不愧是无产阶级专政条件下继续革命的毛主席的好干部。我们一定向他学习，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，不断提高路线斗争觉悟，为执行和捍卫毛主席的革命路线奋斗终生。空军某部大队政委蔺相武是和门合同志同一年出生的，在旧社会都讨过饭，为地主扛过长工；是和门合同志同年入党入伍，现在又都是营一级的政治工作干部。他在找差距，表忠心时说，我一定学习门合同志无限忠于人民，无限忠于党，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席革命路线的崇高品德，把捍卫毛主席革命路线作为自己终生的神圣职责。
    广大干部在学习中一致认为，要想有高度的两条路线斗争觉悟，就必须象门合同志那样，对毛主席、对毛泽东思想，有自觉的忠，彻底的忠。他们以门合同志为榜样，进一步开展了无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的“三忠于”活动，各级干部通过大颂毛主席的英明伟大，大颂毛泽东思想的无比威力，大颂毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利，更加增强了对毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的无产阶级感情。广州部队某部的领导干部，为了锤炼对毛主席的忠心，分别到边防、山区的连队，同战士们一起，以门合同志为榜样，找“三忠于”的差距，表“三忠于”的决心。门合同志生前所在的青海军区某部二营，全营排以上干部，从草原上拔来苦苦菜，到门合同志曾经领导他们学习毛主席著作的地方，同吃忆苦饭，控诉旧社会的阶级压迫，牢记阶级苦，不忘血泪仇，把朴素的阶级感情提高到无限忠于毛主席革命路线的高度上来。他们说：一定要象门合同志那样，始终不渝地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上，一切想着毛主席，一切服从毛主席，一切紧跟毛主席，一切为着毛主席。
    在学习中，广大干部深深感到，门合同志所以能够一贯地、坚决地、自觉地站在毛主席革命路线一边，是因为他如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作，学用结合，真正把毛泽东思想学到手。江西省井冈山军分区政治部主任白云旺，学习了门合同志的事迹，深有体会地说，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线是彻底为公的路线，没有彻底为公的思想，就不能理解毛主席的革命路线，就会“怕”字当头，不敢捍卫毛主席的革命路线。我一定要象门合同志那样，刻苦地活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想破私立公，努力改造自己的世界观，做一个坚决执行、誓死捍卫毛主席革命路线的革命战士。广州部队某部副主任汤天顺学习门合同志的事迹后，立即下到连队，亮私心，摆问题，同战士们一起学习毛主席著作，请战士帮助自己提高两条路线斗争觉悟。他说，“私”字斗得越彻底，对毛主席越忠，只有狠斗“私”字，不断提高两条路线斗争觉悟，才能坚决执行、勇敢捍卫毛主席的革命路线。
    毛主席最近指出：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”广大干部认真学习毛主席的最新指示，联系门合同志的光辉事迹，深刻认识到，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线就是最彻底的群众路线，代表了无产阶级和广大人民群众的根本利益。只有密切联系群众，始终保持劳动人民本色，永远和群众同呼吸，共命运，对毛主席的革命路线才能深刻理解，步步紧跟。许多头发斑白的老干部，新提到领导岗位的青年干部，以门合同志为榜样，纷纷背着背包，下到连队，同战士们一起放哨站岗，一起学习，一起劳动。兰州部队某团团长张仁杰、政委庄叔明亲自带领机关干部背着背包，举着“向无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部门合同志学习”的标语牌，到连队去，和战士们生活在一起。张仁杰和庄叔明处处以普通一兵要求自己，白天同战士一起学习，晚上同战士们一起放哨站岗。广州部队活学活用毛泽东思想先进集体、某团党委领导成员，在政委宋子佩带领下，到驻地附近农村，同贫下中农同吃、同住、同劳动，一起批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在农村推行的反革命修正主义黑货，进一步提高了自己的路线斗争觉悟。
    学门合，见行动。战斗在“三支”“两军”第一线的各级干部，在学习门合同志的活动中，紧密结合当前阶级斗争新形势，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛泽东思想，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席最新指示，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利立新功。驻天津部队某部团长袁儒在一个工厂执行支左任务，前不久，厂里死不悔改的走资派掀起了一股翻案妖风，阴险地把斗争矛头指向厂革命委员会。这时，袁儒学习了门合同志英雄事迹，毫不犹豫地挺身而出，坚决地按照毛主席指引的方向，发动群众揭露了走资派的阴谋，勇敢地捍卫了新诞生的革命委员会。在地方上执行支左任务的广州部队活学活用毛主席著作积极分子、某团政委郑伟峰，学门合，找差距，感到自己成了一个单位革命委员会的成员以后，相信群众不如过去坚决，依靠群众不如过去有力，便主动地到群众中去，听取群众批评，和群众一起学习门合同志，一起开展革命大批判。他说，我们一定遵照毛主席的教导，向门合同志学习，永远密切联系群众，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
