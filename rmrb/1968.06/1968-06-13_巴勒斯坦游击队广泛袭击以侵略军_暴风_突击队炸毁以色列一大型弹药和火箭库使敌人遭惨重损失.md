The "Fatah" (Palestine Liberation Movement) issued a battle report in Damascus stating that on the night of the 9th, the "Storm" commando unit of this organization blew up a large ammunition and rocket depot of Israel near Yavne, about 20 kilometers south of Tel Aviv. The explosion lasted for nine hours, causing heavy losses to the Israeli aggressors.

According to a Western news agency, hundreds of tons of weapons and ammunition exploded in the depot, and the explosions could be heard in Tel Aviv. The Israeli reactionary authorities hurriedly took emergency measures to protect the atomic reactor set up in this area.

According to the battle report of "Fatah" and Syrian newspapers, in the past ten days, Palestinian guerrillas have launched about twenty attacks on Israeli aggressors in the West Bank of the Jordan River, the Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights, and areas under Israeli rule. This not only caused heavy casualties among the Israeli aggressors but also tied down a large number of Israeli aggressor troops concentrated in the West Bank of the Jordan River.

According to reports, the concentration of these troops indicates that the Israeli aggressors are planning a new military aggression against Arab countries.

On the night of the 2nd, the "Storm" commando unit launched its first attack in the Akka region in the northwest of the Israeli-controlled area.

The "Storm" commando unit ambushed an Israeli military vehicle on the public road between Ikrit and Tabiha, annihilating all the enemy soldiers on board.

On the night of the 6th, the "Storm" commando unit shelled an Israeli armored unit's camp in the Tabas Valley south of Shuweir, killing and wounding many Israeli aggressors, destroying two tanks, two half-tracked military vehicles, and two other vehicles, and demolishing two barracks.

In the early hours of the 7th, the "Storm" commando unit, in coordination with the "Lightning" commando unit of the Palestine People's Liberation Front, launched a joint attack on an Israeli camp northeast of Jericho in the West Bank of the Jordan River. They killed and wounded twelve Israeli aggressors, damaged two barracks, destroyed one half-tracked military vehicle and one jeep.

    “暴风”突击队炸毁以色列一大型弹药和火箭库使敌人遭惨重损失
    新华社大马士革十一日电　据“法塔赫”（巴勒斯坦解放运动）在这里发表的战报说，九日晚上，这个组织所属的“暴风”突击队在特拉维夫市以南二十公里的亚夫纳附近，炸毁了以色列的一大型弹药和火箭库，弹药爆炸持续了九个小时，使以色列侵略者遭到惨重损失。
    据一家西方通讯社报道：在军火库里爆炸了数以百吨计的武器弹药，在特拉维夫也可以听到爆炸声，以色列反动当局慌忙采取紧急措施，保护设置在这个地区附近的原子反应堆。
    另据“法塔赫”的战报和叙利亚报纸报道：巴勒斯坦游击队在过去十天内，在约旦河西岸、加沙地带、戈兰高地和以色列统治区对以色列侵略军发动了约二十次袭击。这不仅使以色列侵略军遭到重大伤亡，并且牵制了集结在约旦河西岸的大量以色列侵略军队。
    据报道：这些军队的集结表明以色列侵略者正在计划对阿拉伯国家发动一次新的军事侵略。
    二日晚，“暴风”突击队在以色列统治区西北的阿克地区发动了第一次袭击。
    “暴风”突击队在伊克里特和塔比哈之间的公路上伏击了一辆以色列军车，车上敌军全部被歼灭。
    六日晚，“暴风”突击队炮击在塔巴斯山谷舒韦尔以南的以色列装甲部队的兵营，打死打伤许多以色列侵略军，击毁坦克两辆、半履带式军车两辆和其他车辆两辆，摧毁两座营房。
    七日凌晨，“暴风”突击队协同巴勒斯坦人民解放阵线的“闪电”突击队，对约旦河西岸杰里科东北的以色列兵营发动联合进攻，打死打伤以色列侵略军十二名，炸坏了两座营房，击毁半履带式军车一辆和吉普车一辆。
