	The revolutionary committee of Suzhou People's Commune in Zijing County, Guangdong Province, has made initial experiences in fully utilizing the leading role of brigade and production team cadres in the revolutionary criticism, focusing on the active thoughts in the revolutionary criticism, and guiding them appropriately to sustain and deepen the revolutionary criticism.

	How to handle the busy agricultural season?

	During the busy agricultural season, should the revolutionary criticism be continued? Can it be continued? To solve this problem, Yongxin Production Team started by raising the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the commune members. They organized the commune members to study Chairman Mao's teaching: "As for the countryside, if socialism does not occupy it, capitalism will inevitably occupy it." They linked this to actual situations and recalled historical facts of the two-line struggle in the countryside. In 1963, the biggest handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, through their agent Zhao Ziyang in Guangdong, promoted the "three self and one contract" revisionist line of Chinese Khrushchev here. At that time, it was the busy spring plowing season, but he ignored everything and spread poison relentlessly. As a result, "contracting to households," "work points as the commander," and "material incentives" and other revisionist goods flooded the area. Facts show that the line struggle, whether during the busy agricultural season or not, is fiercely ongoing. After discussions, the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the commune members was significantly raised. Old poor peasant Zheng Shiliu said: "Revolutionary criticism is a treasure for defending the country. No matter how busy the production is, it must be continued."

	Chairman Mao taught us: "We not only put forward tasks but also solve the problem of methods to complete the tasks. Our task is to cross the river, but without a bridge or a boat, we cannot cross. Not solving the problem of the bridge or boat, crossing the river is just empty talk. Not solving the problem of methods, the task is just empty talk." Based on raising the commune members' awareness, Yongxin Production Team, following Chairman Mao's teaching, fully mobilized the masses, collected wisdom from all sides, and solved the problem of methods to carry out revolutionary criticism during the busy agricultural season. After full discussion among the commune members, everyone agreed that revolutionary criticism can be moved from the house to the field, and it can be carried out during the busy agricultural season.

	According to the opinions of the commune members, Yongxin Production Team adopted the "three on-site" method during the busy spring plowing season: exposing the crimes of Chinese Khrushchev on-site, finding the evidence of Chinese Khrushchev's crimes on-site, and criticizing the crimes of Chinese Khrushchev on-site. They utilized the main force of poor and lower-middle peasants and the backbone of the militia, and set up revolutionary criticism battlefields in the fields and construction sites. They ensured that whatever they did, they used it as a trigger, and wherever they went, they carried out revolutionary criticism there. There is more than one mu of land in Zhangtangdu. Before 1927, it belonged to poor peasant Huang Hanxiang. Because Huang Hanxiang owed the landlord's debt, the land was seized by the landlord, and Huang Hanxiang was beaten by the landlord with a gun butt, causing his head to be injured and bleeding. Later, the landlord rented this piece of land to Huang Hanxiang and collected rent every year. One year, due to a pest disaster and reduced production, the rent grain was not paid in full. This landlord not only seized the land but also beat Huang Hanxiang with a gun butt again. It was not until after liberation that this piece of land more than one mu returned to the farmers. Based on this fact, the commune members of Yongxin Production Team, when planting rice in Zhangtangdu, invited Huang Hanxiang to speak about the land history on-site, arousing the class hatred of the commune members, and severely criticizing Chinese Khrushchev's fallacy of "exploitation is meritorious." When weeding in Yematan, the rice seedlings here grew particularly well, which was very different from the rice seedlings in 1963 when the "three self and one contract" poison was rampant. The different growth of crops in the same piece of land showed the different results of the two lines. Yongxin Production Team seized this living fact and discussed the topic of "why the rice seedlings grew poorly in 1963 and why they grow well now," severely criticizing Chinese Khrushchev's "three self and one contract" revisionist line on-site.

	After adopting this "three on-site" method, Yongxin Production Team made the revolutionary criticism closely linked to reality everywhere, solving the active thought that revolutionary criticism cannot be sustained during the busy agricultural season. Therefore, no matter how busy the production is, revolutionary criticism has never been interrupted.

	How to handle the relaxation of efforts?

	In the previous period, in the situation of the rapid establishment of revolutionary committees at all levels, some militiamen in Paozizi Brigade reflected: "The handful of capitalist roaders within the Party led by Chinese Khrushchev have been exposed, and the revolutionary committees of the province, prefecture, county, and commune have been established. The power is in our hands, and the situation is stable. We have fought hard for more than two years, and now it's time to rest." Under the influence of this thought, revolutionary criticism became lax.

	How to handle the relaxation of efforts? After serious analysis and research, the militia company of Paozizi Brigade recognized that the main reason for the relaxation of efforts was the insufficient understanding of the long-term and complex nature of class struggle. Therefore, they seized the class struggle as the key and conducted class education for the militia.

	When the militia company of Paozizi Brigade conducted class education for the militia, they closely linked it to the actual class struggle in the local area and used living facts to educate the militia. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongqi Production Team discovered an account book of a landlord's counter-revolution during the struggle against the enemy. This fact made the cadres of Paozizi Brigade's militia company realize that the enemy has accounts, and we also have accounts: During the Great Revolution of 1927, the reactionary Kuomintang here massacred more than 2,000 revolutionary people and burned down more than 300 houses. Based on this criminal fact, the militia company of Paozizi Brigade, through inviting "three olds" to speak about "three histories" (i.e., inviting old Red Army soldiers, old Red Guards, and old poor peasants to speak about revolutionary struggle history, village history, and family history), eating bitter meals, and going to the places where old Red Army soldiers and old Red Guards fought for "political camping," thoroughly exposed the old accounts of class struggle. Then, they further mobilized the broad masses of commune members to thoroughly expose the current class struggle.

	After the establishment of the commune revolutionary committee, a rich peasant element openly incited some backward commune members to go up the mountain and cut trees randomly, attempting to sabotage production and overthrow the newly established revolutionary committee. After exposing these "two accounts" of class struggle, the militia became more aware that class struggle is long-term and complex, and any relaxation of fighting spirit is wrong. Some militiamen also had deep feelings: "The class enemy is always plotting to restore the old system. When our thoughts relax, we are preparing for the enemy's counterattack, which is very dangerous." They unanimously expressed their determination to sustain and deepen the revolutionary criticism, actively and continuously launch a fierce attack on the class enemy, and thoroughly expose and criticize the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party led by Chinese Khrushchev and the untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, eliminating their poison.

	The militia company of Paozizi Brigade seized the active thoughts and conducted class education, significantly raising the class consciousness of the broad militia, quickly overcoming the relaxation of efforts, and launching a new high tide of revolutionary criticism.

	How to handle the insufficient criticism?

	Not long ago, the revolutionary criticism in Hongqi Production Team of Paozizi Brigade showed the phenomenon of insufficient criticism. Some commune members thought that Chinese Khrushchev had not come to our place, and whether we carried out revolutionary criticism or not did not make much difference. Due to this thought, the revolutionary criticism was not deep and thorough.

	How to handle the insufficient criticism? After repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's teaching on "In the world, there is no love without reason, nor is there hatred without reason," Hongqi Production Team recognized that the fundamental reason for the insufficient criticism was that they had not fully understood the reactionary nature of Chinese Khrushchev. Therefore, they must combine it with reality to shoot at living targets, continue to expose the crimes of the handful of biggest capitalist roaders within the Party led by Chinese Khrushchev, who plotted to usurp the Party, the army, and the government, and attempted to restore capitalism, arousing the commune members' hatred towards Chinese Khrushchev, and thus investing in the revolutionary criticism with the highest fighting enthusiasm, bravely standing at the forefront of the struggle, and defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

	Chairman Mao recently deeply taught us: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a great political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its led broad revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Hongqi Production Team organized all commune members to seriously study Chairman Mao's great instruction, raising the commune members' understanding of the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. On this basis, they linked it to the actual class struggle in the local area and adopted the method of "thinking, looking, and comparing" to arouse the commune members to concentrate their hatred on Chinese Khrushchev. This is: thinking about how the landlord class oppressed and exploited farmers before liberation; looking at what Chinese Khrushchev said and how the local class enemies were active; comparing Chinese Khrushchev with the local class enemies, and seeing where they are the same. In this way, the commune members quickly deeply understood the reactionary nature of Chinese Khrushchev, recognizing that Chinese Khrushchev is the representative and backer of the handful of stubborn capitalist roaders, traitors, spies, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists within the Party, and thus aroused their hatred towards Chinese Khrushchev.

	Hongqi Production Team, by seizing the key and shooting at living targets, quickly changed the phenomenon of insufficient criticism.

	How to handle the criticism without change?

	For a period of time, some commune members in Hecang Production Team of Qingxi Brigade considered personal interests more and cared less about the collective; some cadres were also not united enough. The brigade leading group, in response to this problem, helped them criticize Chinese Khrushchev's fallacies of "public and private fusion," etc. However, after a period of criticism, some problems still existed among certain commune members and cadres. The commune members reflected: "The thunder has been roaring for so long, when will it rain?" The leading group of Qingxi Brigade realized from the voices of the commune members that if there is only criticism without change, the revolutionary criticism will become empty talk, and the poison of Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist line will be difficult to eliminate. Therefore, this phenomenon of criticism without change must be resolutely overcome.

	How to handle the criticism without change? The leading group of Qingxi Brigade, to draw lessons, seriously checked the problems of the previous period of revolutionary criticism. Chairman Mao taught us "to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism." While checking, they also studied Chairman Mao's great instruction, recognizing that the fundamental reason for the previous criticism without change was that they had not combined fighting selfishness with criticizing revisionism, always firing cannons from a distance, and had not exploded a revolution in the depths of the soul. If this continued, no matter how long the criticism was, it could not solve the problem. After drawing this lesson, when helping Hecang Production Team carry out revolutionary criticism, they took Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Three Constantly Read Articles" as their motto, organizing Hecang Production Team cadres to study the great spirit of Zhang Side, Norman Bethune, and Old Man Carving Mountains, taking the basic views of "serving the people," "selflessly for others," "making up one's mind, not fearing sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory" as weapons, severely criticizing Chinese Khrushchev's fallacies of "public and private fusion" and "public with private," fighting against selfishness, putting the transformation of world outlook into the revolutionary criticism, and combining fighting selfishness with criticizing revisionism. Many cadres, after studying the "Three Constantly Read Articles," went through a struggle in their minds and voluntarily exposed their selfishness, exploding a revolution in the depths of their souls.

	Chairman Mao taught us: "The transformation of world outlook is a fundamental transformation." The leading group of Qingxi Brigade helped Hecang Production Team carry out revolutionary criticism. By seizing the key, through studying the "Three Constantly Read Articles," breaking selfishness and establishing public spirit, transforming the world outlook, they thus changed the phenomenon of criticism without change. The problem of insufficient unity among the cadres of Hecang Production Team was solved, bringing a new situation of grabbing revolution and promoting production. Under the leadership of the cadres, all commune members and cadres of the team worked together, and the revolution and production quickly entered a new high tide.

    如何把革命大批判持久深入地开展下去？
    广东省紫金县苏区人民公社取得了初步经验
    本报讯　广东省紫金县苏区人民公社革命委员会在革命大批判中充分发挥大队、生产队领导班子的作用，大抓革命大批判中的活思想，因势利导，使革命大批判持久深入地开展下去。
    生产大忙　怎么办？
    在生产大忙中，革命大批判要不要坚持下去？能不能坚持下去？永新生产队为了解决这个问题，从提高社员的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟入手，组织社员群众学习了毛主席“对于农村的阵地，社会主义如果不去占领，资本主义就必然会去占领”的教导，联系实际，回忆了农村两条路线斗争的历史事实。一九六三年，党内最大的一小撮走资派通过他们在广东的代理人赵紫阳，在这里推行中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”修正主义路线。当时正是春耕大忙，他却不顾一切，拚命放毒，结果使“包产到户”、“工分挂帅”、“物质刺激”等修正主义黑货泛滥一时。事实说明，路线斗争无论农忙或者农闲，都激烈地进行着。经过讨论，社员群众的路线斗争觉悟大大提高。老贫农钟仕流说：“革命大批判是保江山的法宝，生产再忙也一定要坚持搞下去。”
    毛主席教导我们说：“我们不但要提出任务，而且要解决完成任务的方法问题。我们的任务是过河，但是没有桥或没有船就不能过。不解决桥或船的问题，过河就是一句空话。不解决方法问题，任务也只是瞎说一顿。”永新生产队在提高社员认识的基础上，遵照毛主席这一教导，充分发动群众，集思广益，解决在生产大忙中开展革命大批判的方法问题。经过社员群众充分讨论，大家一致认为，革命大批判完全可以由屋里搬到田头，在生产大忙期间坚持开展革命大批判。
    根据社员群众的意见，永新生产队在春耕大忙中采取了就地揭发中国赫鲁晓夫的罪恶，就地找中国赫鲁晓夫的罪证，就地批判中国赫鲁晓夫的罪行的“三就地”的方法，发挥贫下中农主力军和民兵的骨干作用，利用田头工地大摆革命大批判战场，做到干什么就以什么为导火线，走到哪里就在哪里开展革命大批判。樟塘肚有一亩多土地，在一九二七年以前是贫农黄汉祥的，因为黄汉祥欠了地主的阎王债，结果土地被地主夺走，黄汉祥还被地主用枪托打得头破血流。后来地主又把这块地租给黄汉祥，年年收租。有一年因为遭到虫灾减产，租谷没有交清，这个地主不仅把土地夺走，而且又一次用枪托把黄汉祥打伤。直到解放后，这一亩多土地才回到农民手中。根据这一事实，永新生产队的社员到樟塘肚插秧时，就请黄汉祥脚踏实地讲田史，激发起社员群众的阶级仇恨，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫“剥削有功”的谬论。在鸭麻塘中耕除草的时候，这里的禾苗生长特别好，同一九六三年“三自一包”流毒泛滥时候的禾苗相比，大不一样。同一块地作物生长两种不同的情况，说明了两条路线不同的结果。永新生产队又抓住这一活的事实，以“一九六三年的禾苗生长为什么差，现在的禾苗生长为什么好”为题，展开讨论，就地狠批中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”的修正主义路线。
    永新生产队采取这种“三就地”的办法以后，使革命大批判处处联系实际，解决了生产大忙不能坚持革命大批判的活思想。因此，他们无论生产怎样忙，革命大批判从来没有间断过。
    出现松劲　怎么办？
    前一段，在各级革命委员会迅速建立的大好形势下，炮子大队有的民兵反映说：“以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派被揪出来了，省、专、县、公社的革命委员会也已建立起来，大权到手，大局已定，苦战了两年多，现在该歇歇腰了。”在这种思想影响下，革命大批判松懈下来了。
    出现松劲思想，怎么办？炮子大队民兵营经过认真分析研究以后，认识到产生松劲思想的主要原因，是对阶级斗争的长期性、复杂性认识不足。因此，他们针对这个原因抓住阶级斗争这个纲，认真地对民兵进行阶级教育。
    炮子大队民兵营对民兵开展阶级教育的时候，紧紧结合本地区阶级斗争的实际，用活的事实教育民兵。红旗生产队的贫下中农在对敌斗争中查出一个地主的变天账，这一事实使炮子大队民兵营的干部意识到，敌人有账我们也有账：一九二七年大革命时期，国民党反动派在这里残杀了二千多革命人民，烧毁了三百多座房屋。根据这一罪恶事实，炮子大队民兵营通过请“三老”讲“三史”（即请老红军、老赤卫队员、老贫农讲革命斗争史、村史、家史）、吃忆苦饭、到当年老红军和老赤卫队员作过战的地方去“政治野营”等，大翻阶级斗争的老账。然后，进一步发动广大社员群众大揭当前阶级斗争的盖子。
    公社革命委员会成立以后，有个富农分子公然煽动一些落后社员上山乱砍乱伐，妄图以破坏生产来搞垮新生的革命委员会。翻了阶级斗争这“两本账”以后，使民兵更加认识到阶级斗争是长期的、复杂的，任何松懈斗志都是错误的。有的民兵还深有体会地说：“阶级敌人时刻都妄想复辟，我们思想松懈的时候就是给敌人反扑做了准备，真危险极了。”他们一致表示要坚持不懈地开展革命大批判，主动地、持续地对阶级敌人发动猛烈的进攻，把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子斗倒、批臭，彻底肃清他们的流毒。
    炮子大队民兵营针对活思想狠抓了阶级教育，广大民兵的阶级觉悟大大提高，迅速克服了松劲思想，革命大批判又掀起了新高潮。
    批得不狠　怎么办？
    不久前，炮子大队红旗生产队革命大批判，出现批得不够狠的现象。有个别社员认为，中国赫鲁晓夫没来过我们这里，我们搞不搞革命大批判没多大关系。由于存在这种思想，革命大批判搞得不深不透。
    批得不狠，怎么办？红旗生产队经过反复学习毛主席关于“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨”的教导，认识到批得不够狠的根本原因，就是对中国赫鲁晓夫的反动本质还没有完全看透。因此必须结合实际打活靶，继续大揭以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮最大的走资派阴谋篡党、篡军、篡政，妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行，激发社员群众对中国赫鲁晓夫的仇恨，从而以最高昂的战斗热情投入革命大批判，勇敢地站在斗争的最前列，捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    毛主席最近深刻地教导我们：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”红旗生产队组织全体社员群众认真学习了毛主席这一伟大指示，提高了社员群众对无产阶级文化大革命伟大意义的认识。在此基础上，联系本地区阶级斗争的实际，采取了“想一想、看一看、比一比”的办法，激发社员群众把千仇万恨集中到中国赫鲁晓夫身上。这就是：想一想解放前地主阶级是怎样压迫剥削农民的；看一看中国赫鲁晓夫是怎样说的，本村的阶级敌人又是怎样活动的；把中国赫鲁晓夫和本地区的阶级敌人比一比，相同在那里。这样，很快就使社员群众深刻认识到中国赫鲁晓夫的反动本质，认识到中国赫鲁晓夫是党内一小撮顽固不化的走资派、叛徒、特务、地富反坏右分子的总代表、总后台，从而激起了对中国赫鲁晓夫的千仇万恨。
    红旗生产队由于针对活思想抓了关键，打了活靶，批得不够狠的现象，很快就改变了。
    光批不改　怎么办？
    有一段时间，青溪大队禾仓生产队有人考虑个人利益多些，对集体关心不够；有的干部之间也不够团结。大队领导班子针对这个问题，帮助他们开展批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“公私溶化”等谬论，可是批了一段时间以后，某些社员和干部中存在的问题，还是没有解决。社员反映说：“打雷打了这样久，什么时候才能下雨呢？”青溪大队的领导班子从社员群众呼声中意识到，如果只有批而没有改，革命大批判就会成了一句空话，中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义路线的流毒也难以肃清。因此这种批而不改的现象必须坚决克服。
    只批不改，怎么办？青溪大队领导班子为了吸取教训，认真地检查了前段革命大批判的问题。毛主席教导我们“要斗私，批修”。他们一边检查，一边学习毛主席这一伟大指示，认识到前段出现批而不改的根本原因，就是没有把斗私和批修结合起来，老是隔山打吊炮，没有在灵魂深处爆发革命。如果这样继续下去，批得再久也是不能解决问题的。他们吸取了这个教训以后，在帮助禾仓生产队开展革命大批判时，就以毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”为座右铭，组织禾仓生产队的干部大学张思德、白求恩、老愚公的伟大精神，以“为人民服务”、“毫不利己专门利人”、“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”等基本观点为武器，猛批中国赫鲁晓夫“公私溶化”和“大公有私”等谬论，狠斗“私”字，把改造世界观摆进革命大批判中，把斗私和批修紧紧结合起来。许多干部学习了“老三篇”以后，经过一番思想斗争，自觉地把私亮了出来，在灵魂深处爆发革命。
    毛主席教导我们说：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。青溪大队领导班子帮助禾仓生产队开展革命大批判，由于抓住了根本，通过大学“老三篇”，破私立公，改造世界观，因此扭转了批而不改的现象，禾仓生产队干部之间不够团结的问题得到了解决，带来了抓革命，促生产热气腾腾的新气象。在干部的带动下，全队社员和干部拧成一股劲，革命和生产很快出现了新高潮。
