A strong east wind blows across the North China Plain. After the baptism of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Shijiazhuang is renewed and full of vitality.

The workers of Shijiazhuang, guided by the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have achieved outstanding results in the struggle to seize the revolution and promote production. In 1967, the production level of Shijiazhuang's industrial and mining enterprises was the highest since the founding of the nation. This year, the first quarter's production plan was overfulfilled. The city's textile industry, after completing the national plan in full and with a surplus last year, has once again overfulfilled the national plan for the first four months of this year. The average daily output of cotton yarn and cotton cloth has increased by more than seven percent compared to last year. The Jingxing Coal Mine has overfulfilled the national plan for sixteen consecutive months from January last year to April this year. The Shijiazhuang Steel Plant has overfulfilled the national plan for the first half of the year by 13 percent, two months ahead of schedule. An inspiring industrial leap is taking shape in Shijiazhuang.

Standing Firm at the Post

Last June and July, when the broad masses of revolutionary workers in Shijiazhuang were following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment to carry out a thorough criticism of the bourgeoisie, achieve great unity and the three-in-one combination, a handful of traitors, spies, counter-revolutionaries, and diehard capitalist-roaders used the tactics of sowing discord to incite and threaten workers to leave their production posts.

The broad masses of revolutionary workers, with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, braved the storms and waves, resolutely counterattacked the enemy's ferocious onslaught. They said: "To seize the revolution and promote production is a 'people's war' without gunshots. We revolutionary workers must defend Chairman Mao's great line of 'seizing the revolution and promoting production' to the death." A few workers left their production posts, but more workers stepped forward. Workers of the same trade voluntarily increased their workload and extended their working hours. Many workers, whose homes were just across from the factory, ate and slept by the machines, while continuing to carry out revolutionary criticism and protect the factory to ensure production. They said: The workshop is the battlefield for defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We must fight to the end on this battlefield until we achieve complete victory!

Dian Yilan, a worker at the No. 2 Cotton Mill, is one of the millions of ordinary workers. Dian Yilan's post at the drawing frame is a key position in the cotton mill. If production at this post stops, the entire factory's production will be affected. The capitalist-roaders forced several drawing frame workers to leave their posts. Dian Yilan, who had lost seven brothers and sisters to hunger in the old society, saw dozens of looms unable to operate, and her heart burned with class hatred. She thought: "This is not just about drawing frames; it's about fighting the class enemy. If one machine cannot operate, it is disloyal to Chairman Mao. Not one machine can stop, not one inch of cloth can be short." She increased her supervision from the original 48 machines to 80.

"One more revolutionary worker in the workshop means one more force to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and one more blow to the class enemy." Many workers who had been resting due to illness or retirement returned to their production posts with revolutionary enthusiasm. More than 80 retired workers from the No. 4 Cotton Mill heard the news of the traitors, spies, and capitalist-roaders sabotaging production and immediately went to the factory to request work. Others worried about their health, but they said: "Thinking of Chairman Mao, even the sick feel well, and the old become young." With a high sense of political responsibility, they fought on the production front. Old worker Wang Liangui from the No. 1 Cotton Mill specially convened a family meeting and told his children the family history: In a cold winter before liberation, his mother took him out to beg for food. After two days, they only got two moldy vegetable cakes. His mother saved them for him and continued to beg for food, starving to death in a pile of graves. As they spoke, the whole family cried. The child, Wang Baolin, with tears in his eyes, said: "Now the class enemy wants to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and production, dragging us back to the old days. We will not agree. We must listen to Chairman Mao and seize the revolution and promote production." The next day, this child went to the No. 1 Cotton Mill's finishing department to help with the cloth. More than 170 old workers from the No. 1 Cotton Mill brought their children to the workshop to help with production. These children continued to help until the struggle was won before going home.

The broad masses of workers' actions to seize the revolution and promote production deeply moved the deceived workers. They returned to the workshop one after another, actively participated in production, and exposed the class enemy's crimes of sabotaging production with their personal experiences.

Daring to Enter the Fire

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! With a heart loyal to you, the working class can brave the storms and waves, shatter the enemy's plots; with a heart loyal to you, the working class can brave fire and water, overcome all difficulties, and achieve victory in the production struggle.

Since its establishment, the production of the Shijiazhuang Dyeing and Printing Factory has not been good. Around November 10 last year, based on the factory's production situation at the time, it was calculated that 85 days were needed to complete the 1967 national plan. With only 50 days left, what should be done? Some said: "The task cannot be completed, it is already a fait accompli," "To complete the plan, the machines will be damaged and become scrap." But the workers said: "This year is the first year of our proletarian revolutionary faction in power. Chairman Mao supports us, and we must make Chairman Mao proud. No matter how great the difficulties, we must overcome them," "Chairman Mao tells us to seize the revolution and promote production. We listen to Chairman Mao's words, and the machines will listen to us."

They brought their production problems to the Mao Zedong Thought study class to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao taught us: "You want knowledge, you have to participate in the practice of transforming reality." They suddenly understood. They said: "Listen to Chairman Mao's words, start doing it, find problems in the process, and solve problems." They first tried to increase the amount of cloth fed into the dyeing process. During the dyeing process, they carefully observed and analyzed, quickly discovering that the "singeing" process could not go up, affecting the dyeing speed, while the process was the main obstacle to the "singeing" process not going up. They immediately studied and reformed the process, and the dyeing output increased by 20 percent. In 1967, without increasing equipment, raw materials, or labor, they completed the national plan six days ahead of schedule, creating the highest record in the factory's ten-year history. Currently, the daily output of dyed and printed cloth has increased by 50 percent compared to the national daily output quota. The machines did not become scrap but were even better to operate. In the past, some machines in this factory had to stop for maintenance every few days. This year, the first quarter has not stopped for more than 50 days. The workers said: "Our factory is reborn thanks to Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought has armed people's minds, changed people's spiritual outlook, and changed the machines."

With boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, the workers of Shijiazhuang always bravely step forward and resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's great line of "seizing the revolution and promoting production" when encountering special situations in production.

In January this year, when the workers of the Shijiazhuang Steel Plant were enthusiastically welcoming the "red start" of 1968, the roof of the heating furnace in the rolling mill suddenly collapsed. According to routine procedures, it would take three days just to cool down the furnace, plus rebuilding the roof and raising the temperature, at least eight days to resume production. The workers said: "There are only a few eights in a month? We are Chairman Mao's workers and must defend Chairman Mao's line of 'seizing the revolution and promoting production'!"

They filled the furnace with ash and then laid bricks on top. After covering the roof, they crawled into the furnace to remove the ash. At that time, the temperature of the furnace wall was five or six hundred degrees, and the ash was red-hot. Someone said: "It's a sea of fire inside, you can go in but not come out." More people said: "To defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we must enter the sea of fire."

Li Shuluan, a young worker and son of a poor peasant, held up a red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and loudly recited: "With firm resolve, fearing neither sacrifice nor difficulty, surmounting all obstacles, and striving for victory," and rushed in. As soon as he entered, his eyes were filled with stars, and his ears and face, wrapped in towels, felt like they were being pricked by needles. He had just shoveled out a shovel full of ash, his eyebrows caught fire, and his cotton-padded jacket and hat smoked. But he thought: The more ash I shovel out, the sooner the furnace can be fired up. He shoveled out another shovel full with all his might before crawling out of the furnace door.

Going in was obviously dangerous, should they go in again? Everyone sat around the furnace door and opened the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" again, reading aloud, "Carry forward the spirit of daring to fight, fearing neither sacrifice nor fatigue, and fighting continuously (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest)." The second and third persons went in. An old worker also rushed to go in, but the workshop cadres, considering his safety, advised him to wait until the furnace temperature was lower before going in. The old worker said firmly: "They are Chairman Mao's workers, and I am also Chairman Mao's worker. They can go in, why can't I?" He also rushed in to shovel out a shovel full. In this way, one went in, one came out; one shovel, one shovel. In just over two hours, they shoveled out all the ash in the furnace, and production was resumed in just over nine hours.

Climbing New Heights

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Humanity must constantly summarize experience, make discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress." With a heart loyal to Chairman Mao, the workers of Shijiazhuang, based on their achievements, remain humble and continue to take class struggle as the key link, carrying out mass technical innovation and technological revolution activities to defend Chairman Mao's line of "seizing the revolution and promoting production," making new contributions.

In January this year, under the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support troops, the broad masses of workers further studied Chairman Mao's great line of "seizing the revolution and promoting production," criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of "expert management" and "one-man rule" pushed by Liu Shaoqi in factories and enterprises, and exposed the shocking class struggle facts in the field of technical innovation and technological revolution in this region and unit: A handful of traitors, spies, and capitalist-roaders in the Shijiazhuang region colluded with reactionary "technical authorities" to implement technical monopolies, slandering poor and lower-middle peasants and workers of technical origin as "stupid" and "uneducated," suppressing workers' creativity and enthusiasm. Many workers' inventions and innovations were strangled, and some workers were even labeled as "active counter-revolutionaries" for their innovations. After the proletarian revolutionary faction took power, a handful of class enemies continued to spread poison behind the scenes: "You have no technical 'experts,' you can't do production well, you can't hold power even if you seize it." Through revolutionary criticism, the workers' consciousness was raised. They said: "This is not just about production; it is class struggle. Our workers have inventions and innovations, which is a powerful blow to Liu Shaoqi's revisionist line with actual actions."

Many factories carried out revolutionary criticism while carrying out technical innovation and technological revolution activities. Several ordinary workers at the Shijiazhuang Dyeing and Printing Factory, through revolutionary criticism, with deep hatred for Liu Shaoqi, made a "controllable organic rectifier transformer" by themselves, saving a large amount of electrical equipment and materials. Not only that, but each machine also saves the country 32,000 degrees of electricity per year. The workers of the Shijiazhuang Light Bulb Factory, in the absence of equipment and materials, successfully developed a "sealed sorting combined machine" that performs nine processes in one automatic operation, with work efficiency increased by several times. The Shijiazhuang textile industry has implemented and is implementing 59 major technical innovation and technological revolution projects from January to April.

The original production technology of the Shijiazhuang Lead Wire Weaving Factory was very backward. The entire production process had only a few wooden machines for weaving lead wire. Even these few machines were difficult to operate. The workers said: "Strong people become thin on this machine, and weak people become sick." Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, workers wanted to try making a semi-automatic weaving machine. A handful of capitalist-roaders in the factory maliciously ridiculed: "The things you make have no machine smell but have a chicken shit smell." The workers' innovation suggestions were thus strangled. Recently, when criticizing Liu Shaoqi's revisionist line, they combined criticizing the crimes of a handful of capitalist-roaders in their factory. The workers' enthusiasm for making a semi-automatic combined weaving machine soared. They said: "Making this machine is the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and a powerful blow to Liu Shaoqi." With deep class feelings for Chairman Mao and deep hatred for Liu Shaoqi, they overcame numerous difficulties and successfully developed the new machine. At the test-run site, they continued to carry out revolutionary criticism, using living facts to refute Liu Shaoqi's revisionist line.

The decisive victory achieved by the workers of Shijiazhuang in defending Chairman Mao's great line of "seizing the revolution and promoting production" is the result of the help from the leftist support troops of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shijiazhuang in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought.

Since February last year, following the instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, this leftist support troop has been involved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shijiazhuang's industrial and mining enterprises. For more than a year, no matter how sharp and complex the class struggle was, they firmly and unyieldingly grasped and emphasized the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, making the broad masses of workers, in the great storms and waves of the revolution, never lose their way or change their course.

    车间就是捍卫毛主席革命路线的战场
    ——记石家庄工人阶级在抓革命促生产中的英雄事迹
    强劲的东风，吹过华北平原。石家庄经过无产阶级文化大革命战斗的洗礼，万象更新，生气勃勃。
    石家庄工人阶级，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想统帅自己的一切行动，在抓革命促生产斗争中创造了出色的成绩。一九六七年，石家庄工矿企业的生产水平，是建国以来最高的一年，今年第一季度又超额完成了生产计划。全市纺织工业继去年全面超额完成国家计划以后，今年一至四月份又月月超额完成了国家计划，棉纱、棉布平均日产量都比去年增长百分之七以上。井陉煤矿从去年一月到今年四月，连续十六个月超额完成国家计划。石家庄钢厂已提前两个月超额百分之十三完成了上半年国家计划。一个令人鼓舞的工业跃进局面正在石家庄形成。
    坚守在岗位上
    去年六、七月份，正当石家庄广大革命职工紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，如火如荼地开展革命大批判，实现革命大联合和革命三结合的时候，一小撮叛徒、特务、反革命分子和顽固不化的走资派，使用挑拨离间的手段，煽动和威胁工人离开生产岗位。
    广大革命工人怀着无限忠于毛主席的赤胆忠心，顶黑风，战恶浪，坚决反击阶级敌人的猖狂进攻。他们说：“坚持抓革命促生产，是一场没有枪声的‘人民战争’。我们革命工人一定要誓死捍卫毛主席‘抓革命，促生产’的伟大方针。”少数工人离开了生产岗位，更多的工人顶上来。同工种的工人，主动要求增加工作量，延长工作时间。许多工人，家就在厂房对面，也吃在机器旁，睡在机器旁，一面坚持开展革命大批判，一面护厂搞生产。他们说：车间就是捍卫毛主席无产阶级革命路线的战场，一定要在这个战场上坚持战斗到彻底胜利！
    国棉二厂挡车女工田益兰，是千万普通工人中的一个。田益兰所在的挡车岗位，是棉纺厂的关键岗位。这个岗位的生产停下来，整个工厂的生产就要受影响。走资派威逼好几个挡车女工离开了生产岗位。田益兰，这个在旧社会饿死七个哥哥、姐姐的女工，眼看几十台布机开不了车，怎么也按不住心头的阶级仇恨。她想：“这不是挡车，这是和阶级敌人作斗争，有一台机器开不了车，就是对毛主席不忠。一台机器也不能停转，一寸棉布也不能短。”她从原来看四十八台机器，增加到看八十台。
    “车间多一个革命工人，就增加一分捍卫毛主席革命路线的力量，就增加一分对阶级敌人的打击”，许多因病休息和退休的工人满怀革命豪情重返生产岗位。国棉四厂八十多位退休老工人，听到叛徒、特务、走资派破坏生产的消息，马上到工厂要求上班。别人怕他们身体不好，他们说：“心里想到毛主席，有病的就好象没病了，年老的变得年轻了。”他们怀着高度的政治责任感，战斗在生产岗位上。国棉一厂老工人王良桂特意召开了家庭会议，给孩子讲家史：解放前的一个寒冬腊月，他母亲带着他出去要饭。要了两天，只要到两块发霉的菜饼。母亲省给他吃，继续忍饥挨饿出去要饭，饿死在一个乱坟堆里。说着说着，全家都哭了。孩子王宝林噙着眼泪说：“现在阶级敌人想破坏无产阶级文化大革命，破坏生产，把我们往老路上拉，我们坚决不答应。我们一定听毛主席的话，抓革命，促生产。”第二天，这个孩子就到国棉一厂整理车间帮助刷布。国棉一厂共有一百七十多个老工人带着自己的孩子到车间来帮助生产，这些孩子一直坚持到斗争胜利才回去。
    广大工人坚持“抓革命，促生产”的行动，深深感动了受蒙蔽的工人。他们纷纷回到车间，积极参加生产，并且以亲身的经历，揭发阶级敌人破坏生产的罪行。
    火海也敢闯
    毛主席啊，毛主席！工人阶级有了一颗忠于您的红心，就能够顶黑风，战恶浪，粉碎阶级敌人的阴谋；工人阶级有了一颗忠于您的红心，就能够在生产斗争中，赴汤蹈火，排除万难，夺取胜利。
    石家庄印染厂从建厂以来，生产一直不很好。去年十一月十日左右，根据当时工厂生产情况计算，要完成一九六七年国家计划，还需要八十五天时间。只剩下五十天了，怎么办？有人说：“完不成任务，已成定局”，“要完成计划，机器就要损坏，变成废铁了”。可是，工人说：“今年是我们无产阶级革命派掌权的第一年，毛主席给我们撑腰，我们要给毛主席争气，天大的困难也要克服”，“毛主席叫我们抓革命促生产。我们听毛主席的话，机器就会听我们的话。”
    他们带着生产中的问题，在毛泽东思想学习班里活学活用毛主席著作。毛主席教导我们说：“你要有知识，你就得参加变革现实的实践”。他们豁然开朗起来。他们说：“听毛主席的话，先干起来，在干的过程中，发现问题，解决问题。”他们首先试着加大了染布投布量。在染布过程中，他们仔细观察、分析，很快发现“烧毛”这道工序上不去，影响染布速度，而工艺这道工序是“烧毛”上不去的主要障碍。他们立即研究并且改革了工艺工序，染布产量一下子提高了百分之二十。一九六七年，在不增加设备、原料、人力的情况下，提前六天超额完成了国家计划，创造了建厂十年来的最高纪录。目前，印染布日产量已比国家规定的日产量增长了百分之五十。机器不但没有变成废铁，反而更好操作了。过去，这个厂有些机器，几天就要停车检修，今年第一季度连续五十多天没有停车。工人说：“我们厂是靠毛泽东思想翻身的，毛泽东思想武装了人的头脑，人的精神面貌变了，机器也变了。”
    石家庄工人阶级怀着无限忠于毛主席的赤胆忠心，在生产遇到特殊情况时，总是挺身而出，坚决执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针。
    今年一月份，石家庄钢厂工人正以冲天干劲迎接一九六八年开门红的时候，轧钢车间加热炉的炉顶突然倒塌。按照常规办事，单单冷却炉子就要三天，外加砌炉顶、提温，至少八天才能恢复生产。工人说：“一个月才几个八天？我们是毛主席的工人，一定要捍卫毛主席‘抓革命，促生产’的方针！”
    他们在熊熊烈火的炉子里填满了灰，然后在上面砌砖，炉顶盖好后，再钻到炉里掏炉灰。当时，炉墙的温度有五、六百度，炉灰火红火红。有人说：“里面是一片火海，进得去，出不来。”更多的人说：“为了捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，火海也要进。”
    贫农的儿子、青年工人李树乱，手举红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高声朗诵着：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，冲进去了。一进去，他两眼直冒金星，用毛巾包得严严的耳朵和面部象针扎一样疼。他刚铲出一锹炉灰，眉毛燃着了，棉袄和帽子冒烟了。但他想：多铲出一锹灰，炉子就能提早一分钟点火。他又使尽全身力气，铲了一锹，才爬出炉门。
    进去，显然是有危险的，还进不进？大家围坐在炉门口，又打开了《毛主席语录》，齐声朗读“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风。”第二个、第三个人进去了。一个老工人也抢着要进去，车间干部考虑到他的安全，劝他等炉温低一点再进去。这个老工人斩钉截铁地说：“他们是毛主席的工人，我也是毛主席的工人。他们能进，我为什么不能进？”他也争着进去铲了一锹。就这样，你进去，他出来；你一锹，他一锹，短短两个多钟头就把一炉灰铲完了，只花了九个多小时就恢复了生产。
    攀登新高峰
    毛主席教导说：“人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。”石家庄工人阶级怀着一颗忠于毛主席的赤胆忠心，在取得胜利的基础上，戒骄戒躁，继续以阶级斗争为纲，开展了群众性的技术革新、技术革命活动，为捍卫毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的方针，做出了新的贡献。
    今年一月份，广大工人在解放军支左部队帮助下，进一步学习了毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫在工厂企业里推行的“专家治厂”、“一长制”的反革命修正主义路线，揭发了本地区、本单位在技术革新和技术革命领域里触目惊心的阶级斗争事实：石家庄地区一小撮叛徒、特务、走资派，勾结反动技术“权威”，实行技术垄断，污蔑贫下中农和工人出身的技术员“脑袋笨”、“没文化”，压制工人的创造性和积极性。许多工人的创造、发明被扼杀了，甚至有些工人因搞创造、发明，被打成“破坏机器的现行反革命”。无产阶级革命派掌权以后，一小撮阶级敌人仍然在背后煽阴风：“你们没有技术‘专家’，搞不好生产，夺了权，也不能掌权。”经过革命大批判，工人阶级觉悟提高了。他们说：“这不只是搞生产，这是阶级斗争。咱工人有了发明创造，就是用实际行动狠狠打击中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线。”
    许多工厂一面开展革命大批判，一面开展技术革新、技术革命活动。石家庄印染厂几个普通工人，通过革命大批判，怀着对中国赫鲁晓夫的刻骨仇恨，自己制成“可控有机整流变压器”，节约了大量电气设备和电气材料。不仅如此，每台机器每年还给国家节约电三万二千度。石家庄灯泡厂工人在设备、材料缺乏的情况下，试制成功了九道工序联合进行自动操作的“封排联合机”，工效提高了好几倍。石家庄纺织工业战线一至四月份已经实行和正在进行的较大的技术革新、技术革命项目，已达五十九个。
    石家庄铅丝编织厂原来的生产技术十分落后，整个生产工序，只有编织铅丝这道工序有几台木制机子。就是这几台机子，操作时也很费劲。工人们说：“壮实的人上了这台机子变瘦了，瘦弱的人变病了。”在无产阶级文化大革命以前，工人就想试制一台半自动化织网机。厂内一小撮走资派恶毒地讽刺说：“你们搞出来的东西，没有机器味，倒有鸡屎味。”工人的革新建议，就这样被扼杀了。最近，他们在批判中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线时，结合批判了本厂一小撮走资派的罪行，工人自制半自动化联合织网机的劲头更加高涨。他们说：“把这台机器搞出来，就是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的胜利，就是对中国赫鲁晓夫的一个有力打击。”他们怀着对毛主席的深厚阶级感情，怀着对中国赫鲁晓夫的刻骨仇恨，克服了重重困难，把新机器试制成功了。在试车现场，他们继续开展了革命大批判，用活生生的事实，批驳了中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线。
    石家庄工人阶级在捍卫毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针中所取得的决定性胜利，是驻石家庄解放军支左部队帮助他们活学活用毛泽东思想的结果。
    这支支左部队自从去年二月遵照伟大领袖毛主席的指示，介入石家庄工矿企业文化大革命运动以来，坚持用毛泽东思想武装广大工人阶级。一年多来，不管阶级斗争多么尖锐、复杂，他们都坚定不移地狠抓、紧抓活学活用毛泽东思想，使广大工人在革命的大风大浪中，始终不迷航，不转向。　本报记者
