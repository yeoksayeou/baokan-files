Cambodia Donates a Batch of Gifts to the Vietnamese People

New China News Agency, Phnom Penh, June 15th — On the morning of the 14th, Cambodian Head of State Prince Norodom Sihanouk presided over the handover ceremony for a batch of gifts donated to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

The batch of gifts included 18 tons of dried fish and 43 boxes of medicine.

In his speech at the ceremony, Prince Sihanouk pointed out that this batch of gifts "once again demonstrates our unity in resisting American aggression." He said, "The victories of the Vietnamese people in resisting the American aggressors are also the victories of all free people in the world. These victories show that a proud nation, as long as it is determined to defend its most sacred rights and the future of its descendants, is invincible."

When discussing the solution to the Vietnamese issue, Prince Sihanouk said, "That is (for the United States to) acknowledge the Vietnamese people's right to resolve their internal affairs according to their own will, which clearly means to unconditionally stop the criminal bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and to unconditionally withdraw American troops from South Vietnam."

Prince Sihanouk then pointed out, "It is necessary to clearly distinguish between the aggressors and the victims, between the thieves and the robbed, therefore, the various lies of the American authorities in reversing black and white cannot deceive anyone."

He also pointed out that the United States "actually demands that the Vietnamese people, as the masters of their own country, acknowledge the fait accompli of American aggression, acknowledge the colonial rights that the United States arbitrarily exercises in Vietnam, and actually demands that the Vietnamese people give up their struggle against the aggressors, which is a futile wish."

The Ambassador of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to Cambodia, Nguyen Thuan, and the representative of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to Cambodia, Nguyen Van Huu, also spoke at the ceremony.

    柬埔寨赠送越南人民一批礼品
    新华社金边十五日电  柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王，十四日上午在这里主持了赠送给越南民主共和国和越南南方民族解放阵线的一批礼品的交接仪式。
    这批礼品中包括有十八吨干鱼和四十三箱药品。
    西哈努克亲王在仪式上讲话时指出，这批礼品“再一次表明我们在抗击美国侵略中的团结。”他说，“越南民族抗击美国侵略军的种种胜利，也是全世界一切自由的人们的胜利。这种胜利表明，一个自豪的民族，只要决心保卫自己最神圣的权利和子孙后代的未来，是不可战胜的。”
    西哈努克亲王谈到解决越南问题的途径时说，“那就是（美国）承认越南人民享有按照自己的意愿解决自己的内部事务的权利，这就清楚地意味着无条件地停止对越南民主共和国的罪恶轰炸，同样无条件地从南越撤走美军。”
    西哈努克亲王接着指出，“必须明确区别侵略者与被侵略者、区别盗窃犯与被盗窃者，因此，美国当权者颠倒黑白的种种胡言乱语是骗不了任何人的。”
    他还指出，美国“竟然要求作为本国主人的越南人承认美国侵略的既成事实，承认美国在越南擅自行使的殖民权利，并竟然要求越南人民放弃同侵略者进行斗争，那是痴心妄想。”
    越南民主共和国驻柬埔寨大使阮商和越南南方民族解放阵线驻柬埔寨代表阮文孝，也在仪式上讲了话。
