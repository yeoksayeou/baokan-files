    Chairman Mao teaches us: "In class society, every individual lives in a definite class position, and every kind of thought is imprinted with the brand of a class." Whether a person is revolutionary, non-revolutionary, or counter-revolutionary is determined by their class standpoint and worldview. The Chinese Khrushchev claims that revolution and counter-revolution are "basically a matter of one thought, one moment's difference." This is a thoroughly reactionary idealist fallacy. We must thoroughly criticize and expose it, and eliminate its pernicious influence.

    What kind of vine produces what kind of gourd, what class speaks what words. The Chinese Khrushchev has repeatedly knelt down before imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries, betraying the revolution; for decades, he has consistently opposed the Party, opposed socialism, and opposed Mao Zedong Thought. This is not a matter of "one moment's difference," but a revelation of his reactionary bourgeois standpoint and a display of his reactionary bourgeois worldview. All this stems from the needs of the interests of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes that he represents. By propagating the reactionary fallacy of "one moment's difference," he is actually trying to cover up his own crimes; to cover up the crimes of all traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries; and also to provide a theoretical basis for his schemes to recruit traitors, form cliques, and plot the restoration of capitalism.

    Since liberation, the bourgeoisie has attacked us with sugar-coated bullets; in 1957, the rightists attacked the Party; during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a handful of traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries have repeatedly come out to sabotage military-civilian unity, split the revolutionary ranks, and oppose the newly established revolutionary committees. Is all this a matter of "one moment's difference"? Absolutely not. It is determined by their class nature. They never forget the "paradise" they have lost, constantly plotting to restore it. As soon as they think the conditions are right, they will come out to fight to the death with us. Therefore, we must have no illusions about class enemies and must pursue and attack them relentlessly until they are thoroughly defeated.

    The Chinese Khrushchev's reactionary fallacy of "one thought, one moment's difference" is also a vicious slander against us proletarian revolutionary fighters. We absolutely do not accept it. Proletarian revolutionary fighters armed with Mao Zedong Thought are towering heroes who have no selfish motives. They regard the interests of the proletarian revolution as their highest principle. They are absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This is the instinct of our proletarian revolutionary fighters. Dong Cunrui sacrificed himself to blow up a fortress; Mai Xiande, despite being seriously wounded in the head, continued to fight; Li Wenzhong rescued Red Guards in the rushing waters, saving the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution with his life; Men He faced the explosion of dynamite and used his body to protect his class brothers. All these are not matters of "one thought," but expressions of the firm proletarian standpoint of revolutionary fighters, the result of their constant study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, eliminating selfishness and establishing public spirit, and thoroughly transforming their worldview. Countless heroic deeds are the most powerful refutation of the Chinese Khrushchev's fallacy of "one thought, one moment's difference"; countless heroic figures' noble qualities have sentenced the Chinese Khrushchev's philosophy of treason and capitulationist line to death.

    We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings, stand firmly on the proletarian standpoint, strengthen our awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and actively attack all class enemies. We must achieve a thorough victory in this great political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes.

    粉碎“一念之差”的反动谬论
    某部政治处干事　禹光军
    毛主席教导我们：“在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印。”一个人，究竟是革命，不革命，还是反革命，这是由阶级立场决定的，由世界观决定的。中国赫鲁晓夫胡说什么：革命和反革命，“基本问题是一个想头、一念之差的距离”。这是反动透顶的唯心主义谬论，我们一定要把它彻底批倒，肃清它的流毒。
    什么藤上结什么瓜，什么阶级说什么话。中国赫鲁晓夫几次跪倒在帝国主义和国民党反动派脚下，叛变革命；几十年来一贯反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想，决不是什么“一念之差”，而是他资产阶级反动立场的大暴露，是他资产阶级反动世界观的丑恶表演。这一切都出于他所代表的资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的利益的需要。他宣扬“一念之差”的反动谬论，实际上是为他自己开脱；为一切叛徒、特务和反革命分子开脱；并且也是为他招降纳叛，结党营私，阴谋复辟资本主义制造理论根据。
    解放以来，资产阶级用糖衣炮弹向我们进攻；一九五七年，右派分子向党进攻；无产阶级文化大革命中，一小撮叛徒、特务和反革命分子，一而再，再而三地跳出来，破坏军民团结，分裂革命队伍，反对新生的革命委员会……。这一切，难道是“一念之差”吗？根本不是。这是他们阶级本性所决定的。他们念念不忘已经失去的“天堂”，时刻阴谋复辟。只要他们认为气候合适，就跳将出来，要和我们作拚死的斗争，因此，我们对待阶级敌人，绝不能有丝毫的幻想，必须穷追猛打，把他们彻底打倒。
    中国赫鲁晓夫“一个想头，一念之差”的反动谬论，又是对我们无产阶级革命战士恶毒的诬蔑，我们一万个不答应。用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命战士，是顶天立地的英雄汉，是毫无自私自利之心的人。以无产阶级革命利益为第一生命，这是我们革命战士行动的最高准则。无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，这是我们无产阶级革命战士的本能。董存瑞舍身炸碉堡；麦贤得头部负重伤，仍然坚持战斗；李文忠在激流之中抢救红卫兵小将，用自己的生命保卫无产阶级文化大革命；门合面对炸药爆炸，用自己的身体掩护阶级兄弟。这一切，绝对不是什么“一个想头”的问题，而是革命战士坚定的无产阶级立场的表现，是革命战士平时活学活用毛泽东思想，破私立公，彻底改造世界观的结果。千万桩英雄的行动，都是对中国赫鲁晓夫“一个想头，一念之差”的谬论的最有力的批判；千万个英雄人物的高贵品质，宣判了中国赫鲁晓夫叛徒哲学、投降主义路线的死刑。
    我们要牢记毛主席的教导，站稳无产阶级立场，加强阶级斗争和两条路线斗争观念，主动地向一切阶级敌人进攻，夺取这场无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命的彻底胜利。
