"For the sake of sacrifice and great ambition, daring to change the heavens and the earth." The good cadre who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line—former deputy political instructor of a certain unit, Comrade Men He—at every critical moment in the struggle between the two lines, stood firmly and clearly on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. This is Comrade Men He's former comrade-in-arms, Wu Huanchao (center), introducing Men He's heroic deeds to the people.

"Carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory." The "Heroic Eighth Company" of a certain unit, which was named by the Ministry of National Defense, in carrying out the glorious tasks of "three supports and two militaries" entrusted by the great commander Chairman Mao, conscientiously implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and performed new meritorious deeds for the people.

"This army has a spirit of pressing forward without fear of sacrifice, to subdue all enemies and never be subdued by enemies." Deputy squad leader of a certain unit, Comrade Liu Xuebao, is infinitely loyal to the great teacher Chairman Mao. To eliminate the explosive packages placed by counter-revolutionaries and protect the safety of an important national bridge, he engaged in a heroic struggle with the counter-revolutionaries and was gloriously wounded. This is him studying Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle with revolutionary masses, severely criticizing the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" of China's Khrushchev, and determining to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

"Do not forget class struggle for a moment." Comrade Ding Youjun, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works and deputy squad leader of a certain unit, is infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao. In the struggle against class enemies, he fought bravely and tenaciously, displaying the lofty communist spirit of selflessness. This is him studying Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle with his comrades, determined to carry out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, to thoroughly criticize and expose China's Khrushchev.

Comrade Guo Xiaosi, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works and company commander of a certain unit, is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. He resolutely resisted and fought against the bourgeois military line promoted by the counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ruicheng. In the "three supports and two militaries" work, he used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to educate the masses, making new contributions to promoting revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and deeply carrying out revolutionary criticism. This is him studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the revolutionary committee with the Zhao Mengtao group of the First Cotton Mill in Northwest China.

"Our army is completely for the liberation of the people, working thoroughly for the people's interests." The advanced collective of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works—medical team of a certain unit—followed the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions on medical work to face the countryside, often active on both banks of the Yanhe River and south of the Qinling Mountains, wholeheartedly serving the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and soldiers. The picture shows them washing clothes for soldiers during a treatment break.
