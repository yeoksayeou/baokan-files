In recent days, more than 200,000 revolutionary teachers, students, and staff from colleges, universities, and secondary schools in Shanghai have, in accordance with the instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao on the necessity for intellectuals to combine with workers and peasants, gone to the suburban countryside in succession to participate in the "three summers" (summer harvest, summer planting, and summer management) labor.

To make this year's "three summers" labor even better, each school has paid attention to emphasizing proletarian politics and strengthening ideological education. East China Normal University, Fudan University, Shanghai Normal University No. 1 Affiliated Middle School, and Shipu Middle School, among others, held short-term classes on Mao Zedong Thought before going to the countryside. Revolutionary teachers, students, and staff studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works "The Orientation of the Youth Movement," "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," and the "May 7th Directive," as well as Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions. They decided to take Comrade Tan Hualing as an example, learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants, and carry out the "three loyalties" (loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line) activities more widely and deeply. In the "three summers" labor, they strive to do the "three goods": propagating Mao Zedong Thought well, transforming the subjective world well, and participating in productive labor well.

Shanghai's various schools also require revolutionary teachers, students, and staff who go to the countryside to participate in the "three summers" production labor, linking up with the class struggle in the countryside, and further carrying out a revolutionary great criticism. Jiao Tong University, China Middle School, and Shanghai Normal University, among others, also brought some specialized topics for criticizing the revisionist educational line to the countryside. They used labor breaks to carry out revolutionary great criticism with the poor and lower-middle peasants, severely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev, such as "studying to become an official" and "going to the countryside is 'suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage.'"

Some schools' Red Guards have decided, after going to the countryside, to invite poor and lower-middle peasants to give class education courses and to have bitter-sweet meals with the poor and lower-middle peasants, among other activities, to further raise their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines.

    遵照毛主席的教导，走同工农相结合的道路
    上海二十万师生参加农村夏收
    新华社上海六日电　近几天来，上海市大专院校、中等学校的二十多万革命师生员工，遵循我们伟大领袖毛主席关于知识分子必须同工农相结合的教导，陆续奔赴郊区农村，参加“三夏”（夏收、夏种、夏管）劳动。
    为了把今年的“三夏”劳动搞得更好，各个学校都注意突出无产阶级政治，抓好思想教育工作。华东师范大学、复旦大学、师大一附中、市北中学等校在下乡前，办了短期的毛泽东思想学习班。革命师生员工认真学习了毛主席的光辉著作《青年运动的方向》、《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》和“五·七”指示，以及毛主席的一系列最新指示。他们决心以门合同志为榜样，向贫下中农学习，更广泛、更深入地开展忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的“三忠于”活动，在“三夏”劳动中，努力做到“三好”，即宣传毛泽东思想好，改造主观世界好，参加生产劳动好。
    上海各学校还要求下乡的革命师生员工在参加“三夏”生产劳动中，联系农村阶级斗争实际，进一步开展革命的大批判。交通大学、中国中学、上海师范学院等学校，还把批判修正主义教育路线的一些专题，带到农村去，利用劳动空隙时间，和贫下中农一起开展革命大批判，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“读书做官”，到农村去是“吃小亏占大便宜”等反革命修正主义谬论。
    有些学校的红卫兵小将，已决定下乡后请贫下中农上阶级教育课，同贫下中农一起吃忆苦思甜饭等，通过这样一些活动来进一步提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。
