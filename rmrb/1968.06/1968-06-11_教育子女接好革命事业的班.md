In the Cow Bridge Lane, youth and children make up more than half of the population. What ideology should be used to educate children, and what kind of successors should they be cultivated into? The lane study class organized everyone to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's instructions on cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. This made the broad masses of residents realize that raising children is not for "old-age security," but to use Mao Zedong Thought to educate children, so that they can carry forward the proletarian revolutionary cause and firmly defend the red base of the proletariat. Everyone said: "Among all the demands, the most fundamental demand is to educate children to listen to Chairman Mao's words; among all the forms of care, the greatest care is to educate children to follow Chairman Mao in revolution." Everyone fiercely criticized the feudal moral concepts of "raising children for old-age security" and "hoping for sons to become dragons," as well as the revisionist line on youth education promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev.

There was an old woman named Zhang. Her son, after graduating from a technical school, was assigned to work in the interior. Initially, she was afraid of having no one to take care of her and did not want him to go. After studying Mao Zedong Thought, she realized that it was the "self" that had clouded her mind. She corrected her mistake, sincerely made self-criticism, and personally sent her child to where the country needed him.

To run the youth study class well, the entire lane formed a strong leadership team. Every family held meetings, and every household was mobilized to encourage their children to participate in the study class.

After the study class was organized, the atmosphere changed greatly. The youth took the People's Liberation Army as an example, doing morning military training every day, actively sweeping garbage, cleaning drains, protecting trees, and helping the elderly carry water and deliver coal briquettes. Some youth who had bad habits and made mistakes also voluntarily examined their bad thoughts and bad styles.

In the past, parents were the "head of the household," and children absolutely obeyed their parents' words. Now, in the family study class, children dare to criticize their parents' shortcomings and truly follow whoever's words align with Mao Zedong Thought.

专栏：在毛泽东思想学习班里

    教育子女接好革命事业的班
    在牛桥里弄，青少年和儿童占人数一半以上。用什么思想去教育子女，把子女培养成什么样的接班人？里弄学习班组织大家反复学习毛主席关于培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的指示，使广大居民认识到，养儿不是为了“防老”，而是要用毛泽东思想教育子女，使他们接好无产阶级革命事业的班，保牢无产阶级的红色江山。大家说：“千要求，万要求，教育子女听毛主席的话是最根本的要求；千爱护，万爱护，教育子女跟毛主席闹革命是最大的爱护。”大家狠批“养儿防老”“望子成龙”的封建道德观念，以及中国赫鲁晓夫推行的关于青年教育的修正主义路线。
    有个姓张的老妈妈，她的儿子中专毕业后分配去内地工作，她开始怕身边无人照顾，不愿意他去。学习了毛泽东思想，她认识到这是“私”字迷了心窍。知错就改，张妈妈认真地作了自我批评，亲自送孩子上车到祖国需要的地方去。
    为了办好青少年学习班，整个里弄组成了强有力的领导班子，家家开会，户户发动，动员自己的子女参加学习班。
    学习班组织起来以后，风气大变，青少年们以解放军为榜样，每天清晨搞军训，主动地扫垃圾，刷阴沟，护树木，还帮助老人挑水、送煤球。一些沾有不好的习气，犯过错误的青少年，也自觉地检查了自己的坏思想、坏作风。
    过去父母是“一家之主”，对父母的话绝对服从。现在，在家庭学习班里，孩子们敢对父母的缺点提出批评，真正做到谁的话符合毛泽东思想就听谁的。
