Advance According to the Direction Indicated by Chairman Mao

The advanced collective in Anda County, Shengping Commune, that actively studies and applies Chairman Mao Zedong's Thought in Heilongjiang Province

Forever Walk the Path of Emphasizing Proletarian Politics

Chairman Mao teaches us: "During the entire transitional period, there exist class contradictions, there exist class struggles between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and there exist struggles between the two roads of socialism and capitalism." Our brigade, with the help of the PLA comrades, has achieved some success in work and study. Last year, we attended the first conference of active learners and appliers of Mao Zedong Thought in Heilongjiang Province. At that time, some comrades forgot Chairman Mao's teachings of "being modest, prudent, guarding against arrogance, and guarding against impatience," and began to feel proud. They thought: the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party have been overthrown, the revolutionary leading cadre group has been established, and emphasizing proletarian politics is almost done. From now on, the primary task is not to seize the revolution but to develop production, not to carry out the thought revolution of the people but to wage war against nature. These comrades mistakenly believed that our brigade could not catch up with Dazhai because our corn stalks were not as big as theirs, and our fertilizer was not as much as theirs. Under this guidance, the brigade proposed the "one transformation to promote eight transformations" plan, that is, the transformation of thought revolution to promote mechanization, electrification, water conservation, chemical fertilization, etc. They said "one transformation to promote eight transformations," but in reality, the "eight transformations" squeezed out the "one transformation," and production squeezed out politics. Several brigade cadres were busy with production every day, slackened off in studying Chairman Mao's works, and the originally planned criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev was not implemented.

At this time, the PLA Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in our brigade and we together studied Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin's series of instructions on emphasizing politics. Chairman Mao said: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work. This is especially true during periods of fundamental changes in the socio-economic system." Vice Chairman Lin said: "Always remember class struggle, always remember the dictatorship of the proletariat, always emphasize politics, and always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought." Chairman Mao's teachings and Vice Chairman Lin's instructions hit our target, making us realize that if we did not turn the ship around, we would drift further and further away from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. To thoroughly solve this problem in the minds of cadres and the masses, we held a big discussion throughout the brigade on the issue of which road to take. In the discussion, everyone, based on Chairman Mao's teachings, exposed the cover of class struggle in our brigade. It was truly shocking to see how much we had neglected proletarian politics. For example, some teams proposed the wrong slogan of "struggling for three yuan for one workday," some wanted to open shops to make money; our brigade originally had no fuel for burning bricks, but some teams proposed to build a brick factory. More seriously, while we were focused on the "eight transformations," the handful of capitalist roaders within the local Party saw an opportunity and actively engaged in counter-revolutionary restoration, stirring up a counter-revolutionary wind of reversing cases. Some landlord elements used various means to corrupt cadres, disrupting the revolution and production. At this time, we looked back and studied Chairman Mao's teachings of "never forget class struggle" and felt even more affectionate. Chairman Mao said: "The current Cultural Revolution is only the first one, and there will inevitably be more in the future. The victory or defeat of the revolution will be decided over a long historical period. If things are not done well, capitalist restoration could happen at any time. All Party members and the people of the whole country should not think that one or two, three or four Cultural Revolutions will bring eternal peace. Always be alert and never let your guard down." Chairman Mao's profound teachings and the shocking facts of class struggle made us realize that we must emphasize proletarian politics, let politics lead production, and firmly grasp class struggle and the thought revolution of the people. The reason our brigade took a detour in a short period was that we did not do a good job in the revolutionary criticism, and the poison of Chinese Khrushchev had not been eliminated.

Through this discussion, the awareness of class struggle and line struggle among the broad cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants was greatly enhanced. Everyone realized that after the victory of the revolutionary faction of the proletariat, class struggle had not ended, class enemies were still around, their hearts were not dead, and they were always scheming to reverse cases and change the sky. In this situation, if we forgot class struggle and forgot to emphasize proletarian politics, we would go astray, and while we were busy with the "eight transformations," we would lose the reins and not know how our heads had been cut off. Some peasants said: "In the past, the local capitalist roaders did not grasp the study of Chairman Mao's works, only pursued 'small freedoms,' black piecework, and speculation, leading our brigade astray. Now, we also want to open shops to make more money and do not grasp class struggle. Isn't this going down the old road again?" Some poor and lower-middle peasants criticized us, saying: "If we do not grasp the study of Chairman Mao's works, do not grasp the revolutionary criticism, and do not grasp the thought revolution of the people, we will become 'modified.'" Everyone said: "Unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao is not just in words, but more importantly in actions; we must always listen to Chairman Mao and follow the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao."

Combining the Struggle Against Self with the Criticism of Revisionism

After April last year, a vigorous wave of revolutionary criticism swept through the entire brigade. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants, with their deep class feelings of loving Chairman Mao, wielded the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, fiercely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of Chinese Khrushchev, and eliminated the poison of revisionism spread by Chinese Khrushchev, achieving great results. However, after a period of revolutionary criticism, some people said: we have criticized Chinese Khrushchev's stink for several months. Then, the phenomenon of only struggling against self, not criticizing revisionism, and struggling against self not combined with criticizing revisionism appeared.

Has the revolutionary criticism been done enough? The facts answered this question. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, although the broad poor and lower-middle peasants overthrew the local capitalist roaders and fiercely criticized Chinese Khrushchev, the struggle between the two roads is still ongoing. This made us realize that we must always grasp the core issue of the two roads, repeatedly and deeply carry out revolutionary criticism.

Vice Chairman Lin instructed us: "The struggle against self and the struggle against revisionism are interconnected. Only by thoroughly struggling against the 'self' can we better carry out the anti-revisionist struggle to the end." Our brigade, following Vice Chairman Lin's instructions, combined the struggle against self with the criticism of revisionism, guiding the peasants to place the issue of political direction and which road to take at the forefront of breaking private interests and establishing public interests, making everyone break private interests at the crucial point and establish public interests at the root. A local capitalist roader, originally from a poor peasant family, walked the capitalist road because of his heavy private interests. Through analyzing his process of peaceful evolution, everyone received great education, realizing that "revisionism is a disaster, and private interests are the root." The peasants said: "Private interests are the time bomb planted by Chinese Khrushchev in our minds." "The heavier the private interests, the further away from Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line." Now in our brigade, as long as any thought or behavior that walks the capitalist road shows its head, it is like a rat crossing the street, everyone shouts to beat it.

Our brigade's revolutionary criticism is also closely combined with the work of each period, becoming the driving force for various works. During the autumn distribution, we combined it with the past crimes of the local capitalist roaders deceiving some masses to distribute the public accumulation, fiercely criticized the economic wind of revisionism stirred up by Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, repelled the fierce attacks of the class enemies, and consolidated the collective economy. When promoting the experience of Dazhai-style work-point system, we organized the peasants to criticize the reactionary fallacies of "material incentives" and "work-points in command" of Chinese Khrushchev, making the broad peasants further establish the thought of farming for the revolution.

We deeply feel that revolutionary criticism is a great classroom for actively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle. Only by constantly combining the facts of class struggle in real life and the active thoughts of the masses in the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, criticizing the revisionist line of Chinese Khrushchev, can we further arouse the broad poor and lower-middle peasants' immense hatred towards Chinese Khrushchev and all class enemies, can we thoroughly eliminate the poison of revisionism from the soul, and can we be unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants deeply felt: "The deeper the criticism of revisionism, the closer to Chairman Mao; the fiercer the criticism of revisionism, the closer to Chairman Mao."

Guard Against Arrogance and Prevent Revisionism, Firmly Grasp the Thought Revolution of the Leading Cadres

Chairman Mao recently taught us to "organize a revolutionary leading cadre group that connects with the masses." Over the past year, in the process of running the Mao Zedong Thought School, we deeply felt that the thought revolution of the leading cadre group is a major issue related to whether our brigade can continue to advance in the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines. We must strive to actively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, constantly change our worldview, do a good job in the thought revolution, and truly build the leading cadre group into a revolutionary core that connects with the masses.

After the establishment of our brigade's leading cadre group, some cadres developed a sense of pride and complacency when they saw some achievements in work. Some cadres were deeply influenced by bourgeois ideology, indulged in enjoyment in life, and even had economic dealings with class enemies, almost being pulled down by the class enemies.

How should we view these problems? We studied Chairman Mao's works with this question in mind.

Chairman Mao taught us: "Because of victory, arrogance, the mood of considering oneself a hero, the mood of stopping and not seeking progress, the mood of indulging in enjoyment and not wanting to live a hard life, may grow." Chairman Mao's teachings made us realize that these problems are a reflection of the sharp struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in the situation where the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories. Whether or not to grasp this struggle is a major issue of whether our power goes where, and it is a major issue of testing whether we can be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. After raising our awareness, we took guarding against arrogance and preventing revisionism as the center, held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, invited brigade and team cadres and some poor and lower-middle peasants to participate, thoroughly exposed the cover of class struggle, and educated the broad cadres and peasants.

In the study class, we first studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle and the "Three Constantly Read Articles," taking "struggle against self and criticize revisionism" as the guideline, and waged an annihilation battle against the "arrogance" character, which had a deep impact on the education of cadres. Revolutionary masses representatives said: "We used to think we were revolutionaries, and the capitalist roaders were the ones we exposed, so we became proud and relaxed our self-reform. If this continues, we will go astray." Some cadres said: "After I joined the leading cadre group, I always thought I had more experience and broader knowledge, considering myself great, and brought old habits into the revolutionary leading cadre group. If this continues, I will inevitably go down the old road of the capitalist roaders." Everyone agreed: "Arrogance" is the bridge from "self" to "revisionism," "self" is in the backstage, and "arrogance" is in the front stage. Therefore, to guard against arrogance and prevent revisionism, we must fiercely struggle against private interests and thoroughly change our worldview. In the study class, a high tide of exposing "arrogance" and struggling against "self" was launched, consciously raising the issue of guarding against arrogance and preventing revisionism to the height of being unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao, consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, and ensuring that the socialist mountains and rivers will never change color, making the thought revolution of the cadres take another step forward.

A brigade cadre, before participating in the study class, due to the influence of "arrogance," his officialdom grew day by day, he did not want to participate in the first-line labor, was not democratic in his work, and everything was decided by himself, which caused dissatisfaction among the masses. The masses criticized him, but he not only did not accept it but also wanted to quit. After participating in the study class, he realized that the masses criticized him mainly because he developed a sense of pride after becoming a cadre, producing the thought of being an official and a lord. If he did not correct his mistakes, he would cause damage to the revolution, betray the trust of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and be disloyal to Chairman Mao. He decided to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, actively go to the masses who had the most opinions about him to seek their opinions, consecutively held eight family struggle against self and criticize revisionism meetings, inviting peasants to participate, sincerely made self-criticisms, and humbly accepted the help of the peasants. Since then, his style of work has changed greatly. Although he is not in good health, he tries his best to participate in the first-line labor. The masses saw that he had truly changed his style and recently elected him to attend the county conference of active learners and appliers of Mao Zedong Thought.

"The great ship sails with the helmsman, and the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, unlimited loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the highest standard for the revolutionization of our leading cadre group. Actively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental way for us to guard against arrogance, prevent revisionism, and achieve thought revolution. Our brigade's leading cadre group takes actively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought as the most fundamental way to achieve the revolutionization of the leading cadre group, which ensures that our brigade can advance along the direction indicated by Chairman Mao in the fierce struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines.

    按照毛主席指引的方向前进
    黑龙江省活学活用毛泽东思想先进集体安达县升平公社拥护大队
    永远走突出无产阶级政治的道路
    毛主席教导我们：“整个过渡时期存在着阶级矛盾、存在着无产阶级和资产阶级的阶级斗争、存在着社会主义和资本主义的两条道路斗争。”我们大队在解放军同志的帮助下，在工作和学习方面都取得了一些成绩，去年，还出席了黑龙江省第一次活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表会议。这时，有些同志忘记了毛主席“谦虚，谨慎，戒骄，戒躁”的教导，开始骄傲起来。他们认为：党内一小撮走资派被打倒了，革命领导班子建立了，突出无产阶级政治搞得差不多了，今后首先不是抓革命，而是搞生产，首先不是搞人的思想革命化，而是向大自然开战。这些同志错误地认为：我们大队赶不上大寨，主要是包米棒子没有人家的大，粪肥不如人家的多。就在这种思想指导下，大队提出了“一化促八化”的规划，即思想革命化，促机械化、电气化、水利化、化肥化等等，说的是“一化促八化”，实际上是“八化”挤掉了“一化”，生产挤掉了政治。几个大队干部，整天忙忙碌碌搞生产，学习毛主席著作放松了，原定的批判中国赫鲁晓夫的计划也没有实现。
    就在这时候，住在我们大队的解放军毛泽东思想宣传队和我们一起学习了毛主席、林副主席关于突出政治的一系列指示。毛主席说：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。在社会经济制度发生根本变革的时期，尤其是这样。”林副主席说：“要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。”毛主席的教导，林副主席的指示，打中了我们的要害，使我们认识到：如果再不调转船头，就会越走离毛主席的革命路线越远。为了在干部和群众的思想上彻底解决这个问题，我们就在全大队干部和社员中，围绕着走什么道路的问题，开展了一场大讨论。在讨论中，大家根据毛主席的教导，大揭我们大队阶级斗争的盖子。真是不揭不知道，一揭吓一跳。我们大队不突出无产阶级政治的表现是很多的。例如，有的队提出“为一个劳动日分三元钱而奋斗”的错误口号，有的要开一些店铺来挣钱；我们大队本来没有烧砖的燃料，有的队却提出要建一个砖厂。更严重的是，就在我们一心搞“八化”的时候，本地党内一小撮走资派觉得有机可乘，积极活动，猖狂反扑，刮起一阵反革命翻案风。有的地主分子千方百计地拉拢腐蚀干部，破坏革命和生产。这时候，我们回过头来，再学习毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，就觉得更加亲切。毛主席说：“现在的文化大革命，仅仅是第一次，以后还必然要进行多次。革命的谁胜谁负，要在一个很长的历史时期内才能解决。如果弄得不好，资本主义复辟将是随时可能的。全体党员，全国人民，不要以为有一二次、三四次文化大革命，就可以太平无事了。千万注意，决不可丧失警惕。”毛主席的深刻教导和怵目惊心的阶级斗争事实，使我们认识到：必须突出无产阶级政治，让政治统帅生产，必须狠抓阶级斗争，抓人的思想革命化。我们大队所以会在一个短时期内走了弯路，说明我们革命大批判搞得不好，中国赫鲁晓夫的流毒没有肃清。
    经过这场讨论，广大干部和贫下中农的阶级斗争、路线斗争的觉悟大大提高了。大家认识到：在无产阶级革命派取得胜利以后，阶级斗争并没有结束，阶级敌人人还在，心不死，时刻妄想翻案变天。在这种情况下，如果我们忘记了阶级斗争，忘记了突出无产阶级政治，就会走到斜路上去，就可能在闷着头搞“八化”的时候，丢了印把子，脑袋掉了还不知怎么掉的。有的社员说：“过去本地的走资派，不抓毛主席著作的学习，光搞‘小自由’、黑包工、投机倒把，把我们大队引上了歧路。现在，我们也想开店铺多挣钱，不抓阶级斗争，这不又走上了他们的老路吗？”有的贫下中农批评我们说：“不抓毛主席著作学习，不抓革命大批判，不抓人的思想革命化，就会‘修’字化。”大家都说：“无限忠于毛主席，不能光挂在嘴上，更重要的是实际行动；要永远听毛主席的话，沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线走。”
    把斗私和批修紧密地结合起来
    去年四月以后，在全大队掀起了轰轰烈烈的革命大批判高潮。广大贫下中农，以无限热爱毛主席的深厚阶级感情，奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，肃清中国赫鲁晓夫散布的修正主义流毒，取得了很大成绩。但是，革命大批判开展了一段时间之后，有些人说：大批判搞了好几个月啦，中国赫鲁晓夫那套臭货批判得差不多啦。接着，又出现了只斗私，不批修，斗私不和批修相结合的现象。
    革命的大批判是不是已经搞得差不多了呢？事实回答了这个问题。在无产阶级文化大革命中，广大贫下中农虽然斗倒了本地的走资派，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫，可是两条道路的斗争，仍然在进行着。这使我们认识到，要始终抓住两条道路这个核心问题，反复深入地开展革命大批判。
    林副主席指示我们：斗私和批修“这两件事是互相联系的，只有很好地斗掉了‘私’字，才能更好地把反修斗争进行到底。”我们大队遵照林副主席的指示，把斗私和批修密切结合起来，引导社员把解决政治方向的问题，走什么道路的问题，放在破私立公的第一位，使大家破私能够破在要害处，立公立在根本上。本地有一个走资派，原来是贫农出身，就是因为私心太重，走上了资本主义的道路。通过分析他和平演变的过程，大家受到了很大教育，认识到：“修是祸，私是根”。社员们说：“私字就是中国赫鲁晓夫埋在我们头脑里的定时炸弹。”“私心越重，离毛主席的无产阶级革命路线越远。”现在我们大队，凡是走资本主义道路的思想和行为，只要它一露头，就象老鼠过街一样，人人喊打。
    我们大队的革命大批判，还密切结合每个时期的工作，成为推动各项工作的动力。在秋收分配的时候，我们就结合过去本地走资派蒙蔽一部分群众，要分掉公共积累的罪行，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人刮起的经济主义妖风，打退了阶级敌人的猖狂进攻，巩固了集体经济。在推行大寨式评工记分经验的时候，我们就组织社员批判中国赫鲁晓夫“物质刺激”“工分挂帅”的反动谬论，使广大社员进一步树立起为革命种田的思想。
    我们深深体会到：革命的大批判，是在斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想的大课堂。只有经常地结合现实生活中阶级斗争的事实和群众在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争中的活思想，批判中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义路线，才能更加激起广大贫下中农对中国赫鲁晓夫以及一切阶级敌人的无比仇恨，才能从灵魂深处肃清修正主义的流毒，才能无限忠于毛主席。广大贫下中农深有感受地说：“批修越深，对毛主席越亲；批修越狠，跟毛主席越紧。”
    戒骄、防修，狠抓领导班子的思想革命化
    毛主席最近教导我们要：“组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”一年来，我们在办毛泽东思想大学校的过程中，深刻地体会到，领导班子的思想革命化是关系到我们大队能否在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中继续前进的大问题。我们必须努力活学活用毛泽东思想，不断改造世界观，搞好思想革命化，把领导班子真正建设成为革命化的联系群众的领导核心。
    我们大队领导班子成立后，工作有了一点成绩，有些干部就产生了骄傲自满情绪。有个别干部受资产阶级思想影响很深，生活上贪图享受，甚至发展到和阶级敌人发生经济来往，险些被阶级敌人拉下水去。
    怎样看待这些问题呢？我们带着这个问题向毛主席著作请教。
    毛主席教导我们说：“因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长。”毛主席的教导使我们认识到：这些问题，是在无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的情况下，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线尖锐斗争的反映，抓不抓这个斗争，这是关系到我们政权向何处去的大问题，是考验我们能不能忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席革命路线的大问题。认识提高以后，我们就以戒骄、防修为中心，举办毛泽东思想学习班，吸收大、小队干部和部分贫下中农参加，彻底揭开阶级斗争盖子，教育广大干部和社员。
    在学习班里，首先学习了毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导和“老三篇”，以“斗私，批修”为纲，对“骄”字打了一场歼灭战，对干部教育很深。革命群众代表说：“我们过去总以为自己是造反派，走资派是我们揪出来的，因此就骄傲起来，放松了自己的思想改造。发展下去，就要走上斜路。”有的干部说：“我参加了领导班子以后，总以为自己经验多，见识广，自以为了不起，又把旧作风带到革命领导班子里来了，照这样下去，非走走资派的老路不可。”大家一致认为：“骄”字是由“私”变“修”的桥梁，“私”字在后台，“骄”字在前台。因此，要戒骄、防修，就要狠斗私心，彻底改造世界观。在学习班中，掀起了一个亮“骄”字、斗“私”字的高潮，自觉地把戒骄、防修提到无限忠于毛主席，巩固无产阶级专政，保证社会主义江山千秋万代永不变色的高度来认识，使干部的思想革命化又提高了一步。
    有一个大队干部，在参加学习班以前，由于“骄”字作怪，官气一天天大起来，不愿到第一线参加劳动，办事不民主，自己说了算，对群众态度不好，引起群众不满。群众批评了他，他不但不接受，反而想撂挑子。参加学习班以后，他认识到群众批评自己，主要是自己当了干部以后，滋长了骄傲情绪，产生了做官当老爷的思想。如果不改正错误，就会使革命利益受到损失，就辜负了贫下中农的信任，就是对毛主席的不忠。他下决心遵照毛主席的教导，主动到对他意见最多的群众家里征求意见，连续召开了八次家庭斗私批修会，邀请社员参加，诚恳地作了自我批评，虚心接受社员帮助。从那以后，他的作风有了很大转变，虽然身体不好，也尽量参加第一线劳动。群众看他真正转变了作风，最近又推选他出席了县活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会。
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，是我们领导班子革命化的最高标准。活学活用毛泽东思想，是我们戒骄、防修，实现思想革命化的根本。我们大队领导班子，把活学活用毛泽东思想当成实现领导班子革命化的最根本的一条来抓，这就保证我们大队在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中，能够沿着毛主席指引的方向不断前进。
