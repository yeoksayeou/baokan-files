Over the past year, the Arab people have increasingly recognized that the U.S. imperialists are their number one enemy, and the Soviet revisionists are the number one accomplice of the U.S. imperialists. The flames of armed struggle by the Palestinian people are burning fiercely, dealing a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialists and Israeli aggressors.

New China News Agency, June 4th: Our correspondent reports: On June 5th last year, the U.S. imperialists instigated and supported Israel in launching a large-scale aggression against Arab countries, sparking an unprecedented anti-American upsurge in the Middle East. Over the past year, the struggle of the Arab people against U.S. imperialism has deepened and developed, becoming an important part of the current world revolutionary storm.

War has educated the people and tempered them. Over the past year, the Arab people have, through personal experience and lessons, more clearly recognized that U.S. imperialism is their most vicious enemy, and their struggle is increasingly aimed at U.S. imperialism. In many Arab countries, anti-American demonstrations have been one after another; in the areas occupied by Israel, the armed struggle of the Palestinian people is raging, merging into a surging tide. Especially with the widespread and deepening influence of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, it has pointed the way forward and the path to victory for the Arab people. All this indicates that the situation in the Middle East is undergoing profound changes.

Directing the Struggle Against U.S. Imperialism

For many years, the goal of U.S. imperialism's aggressive policy in the Middle East has been to suppress the surging Arab national liberation movement, extinguish armed struggles in this region, maintain its oil interests in the Middle East, seize the spheres of influence of British and French old colonialism, and control this strategically important region.

However, U.S. aggression policy has met with setbacks and failures in the face of the Arab people's struggle. Just before the U.S.-Israeli aggression last June, the CIA's subversive plots in Syria and Yemen were exposed, U.S.-instigated Israeli military provocations against Syria and other countries were met with counterattacks, the United Arab Republic announced the blockade of the Gulf of Aqaba and demanded that the U.S. imperialist tool, the "United Nations Emergency Force," withdraw from UAR territory and the Gaza Strip. In this situation, under the instigation of the Soviet revisionist leadership, the U.S. imperialists directed Israel to launch a new war of aggression against Arab countries on June 5th last year.

After the U.S. imperialists, in collusion with the Soviet revisionist group, forced the Arab countries to accept the "ceasefire," the U.S. and Israel, with increased ferocity, played the dual strategy of military suppression and political seduction, attempting to force the Arab countries to accept humiliating conditions. The evil face and cunning tactics of U.S. imperialism have been exposed to the broad masses of the Arab people. A young Syrian said well: "U.S. imperialism is the number one enemy of the Arab people, and Zionism is the tool of U.S. imperialism in the Arab world." The Arab people have firmly directed their struggle against U.S. imperialism. In the surging mass demonstrations and gatherings in Arab countries, in newspapers and magazines, and in various other occasions, millions of Arab people have sharply exposed and denounced the U.S. as the mortal enemy of the Arab people, dealing a heavy political blow to U.S. imperialism. The U.S. Christian Science Monitor anxiously said, "The U.S. and the Soviet Union have both suffered crushing blows in the Arab world," and the future of the U.S. in this region has been "deeply and permanently damaged" due to the anger of the Arab people.

The Path of Armed Struggle

The most prominent sign of the deepening development of the Arab people's anti-imperialist struggle over the past year is that the flames of armed struggle by the Palestinian people have burned even more fiercely. This is the direction of the Arab people's struggle and the hope for victory.

For many years, the Palestinian people have experienced various twists and turns in their struggle to reclaim their occupied land. However, as a responsible person from "Fatah" (Palestine Liberation Movement) said: "All methods have disappointed us, only the armed struggle of the people can liberate Palestine." "Fatah" clearly declared its rejection of all "resolutions" and "political solutions" proposed by the U.S. imperialist tool, the United Nations, and resolutely continued the armed struggle to the end.

Over the past year, the Palestinian people, fearless of violence, have fought on the front lines against U.S. imperialism and Israeli aggressors, actively launching armed struggles, defeating the enemy in disarray, and achieving one victory after another. Palestinian guerrillas have broken through the enemy's heavy blockade lines, with the cover and support of Arab residents in the Israeli-occupied areas, adopting flexible guerrilla tactics, launching hundreds of attacks and assaults on the Israeli aggressors. They have used grenades, machine guns, mortars, rocket launchers, and landmines to attack and destroy enemy military camps, vehicles, military outposts, ammunition depots, oil depots, oil pipelines, power stations, warehouses, and bridges. They have injured Israeli Defense Minister Dayan, killed two Israeli regional deputy commanders, and killed and injured many U.S. military "experts" and "advisors." In late March this year, under the instigation of U.S. imperialism, Israel launched a large-scale armed attack on Jordan. Palestinian guerrillas and Jordanian people and soldiers jointly counterattacked, dealing a heavy blow to the Israeli aggressors. The Palestinian guerrillas' victories have greatly boosted the morale of the Arab revolutionary people and greatly dampened the enemy's spirits. Israeli Prime Minister Eshkol also had to admit that the current battles between the Israeli army and Palestinian guerrillas are "more arduous" than those in June last year.

The unprecedented scale of demonstrations

Over the past year, the Arab people's massive anti-American demonstrations have been surging like a tidal wave. From the Mediterranean coast to the shores of the Red Sea, from the Arabian Gulf to the Atlantic coast, workers, peasants, students, teachers, and other strata of people in various countries have been holding demonstrations and marches, issuing thunderous anti-American roars. The scale, number of people, and duration of this anti-American demonstration wave are unprecedented in Arab history.

During the days of last year's war, tens of thousands of Arabs surged into the streets like a tide. They waved their fists, angrily denouncing the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism. In many Arab countries, demonstrators smashed the U.S. embassy, destroyed U.S. aggressive institutions such as "cultural centers" and libraries, expelled U.S. diplomats, confiscated U.S. companies, boycotted U.S. goods, stopped supplying oil to the U.S., demanded the withdrawal of U.S. military bases...

Over the past three months, Syria, the United Arab Republic, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and the Arab regions occupied by Israel have seen three waves of demonstrations: the demonstrations that broke out at the end of March condemned the U.S.-instigated Israeli large-scale invasion of the Jordanian positions on the east bank of the Jordan River; the demonstrations at the end of April and early May protested the U.S.-supported Israeli aggressors' provocative military parade in Jerusalem, threatening the Arab people with a new war; the demonstration wave in mid-May denounced the U.S.-Israeli aggression and expressed support for the Palestinian people taking up arms to liberate their homeland.

Over the past year, the Arab people have been clear in their demonstrations. They shouted: "U.S. imperialism is the number one enemy of the Arab people!" "The Soviet revisionists are the number one accomplice of the U.S.!" "Israel and the United Nations are the tools of U.S. aggression!" These resounding slogans mark the new awakening of the Arab people.

In this anti-aggression struggle, the peoples of various Arab countries have helped, coordinated, and supported each other on various fronts. The Palestinian people have opened new battlefields in the Israeli-occupied areas and the areas under Israeli rule before the war, conducting guerrilla warfare and severely striking the aggressors. Their actions are the strongest support for the struggle of the peoples of other Arab countries against U.S.-Israeli aggression. The peoples of other Arab countries, in turn, support the armed struggle of the Palestinian people by providing training bases, covering and coordinating their guerrilla activities, and organizing fundraising campaigns for them. Facing the most vicious enemy, U.S. imperialism, more and more Arab people have begun to realize that as long as the 100 million Arab people unite more closely and establish a broad anti-U.S. united front, they can build an iron wall of resistance against U.S.-Israeli aggression on the Arab land.

Mao Zedong Thought is the Beacon

In the struggle against U.S. imperialism and Israeli aggressors, more and more Arab revolutionary people have pointed out that the great Mao Zedong Thought is their beacon, the sharpest weapon for their victory over the enemy. Under the eager expectation of the Arab people, Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War," "On Protracted War," "Selected Military Writings of Mao Zedong," "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume 3, and "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in Arabic were published and distributed in the capitals of Syria, Lebanon, and the United Arab Republic in the second half of last year. Many Arab revolutionaries have eagerly studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works, finding the truth of revolution, clarifying the direction of struggle, and obtaining the courage and strength to fight. Many Arab friends, after studying Chairman Mao's works, enthusiastically praised, saying that Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon against imperialism, and is the action guide for the Arab people to struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dog, Israel. Palestinian guerrillas said: "Chairman Mao has pointed out the way for us to liberate Palestine, that is, the way of people's war."

Through the study of Chairman Mao's works, the Arab people gradually understand that although their struggle is tortuous, arduous, and long-term, their future is bright. Many Arab heroic sons and daughters solemnly vow: to take the path of armed struggle, mobilize the broad masses, rely on people's war, and launch sustained and fierce attacks on U.S. imperialism and its running dog, Israel, from all sides!

Currently, U.S. imperialism is rampant around the world, interfering with, controlling, subverting, and invading many countries. As the great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The hands of U.S. imperialism are too long. Every place it invades, it puts a new noose around its own neck. It has already fallen into the encirclement of the people of the whole world." The peoples of various Arab countries will definitely strengthen their unity and persist in their struggle. Any military adventurism and political deception by U.S. imperialism is doomed to fail. Victory will surely belong to the heroic Arab people.

Last year, tens of thousands of people in Algiers, Algeria, held a grand demonstration march. The demonstrators shouted slogans such as "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "The Soviet revisionists are traitors!"

    阿拉伯人民反美斗争浪潮汹涌澎湃
    一年来阿拉伯人民更加认清美帝是头号敌人，苏修是美帝的头号帮凶巴勒斯坦人民武装斗争火焰猛烈燃烧沉重打击美帝及以色列侵略者
    新华社四日讯　本社记者报道：去年六月五日，美帝国主义策动和支持以色列对阿拉伯国家发动了大规模的侵略战争，在中东地区激起了空前的反美高潮。一年来，阿拉伯人民反对美帝国主义的斗争浪潮更加深入发展，成为当前世界革命风暴的一个重要组成部分。
    战争教育了人民，锻炼了人民。一年来，阿拉伯人民从切身经验教训中，更加认清了美帝国主义是他们最凶恶的敌人，他们的斗争矛头也越来越明确地指向美帝国主义。在许多阿拉伯国家，反美示威一浪接一浪；在以色列占领区，巴勒斯坦人民武装斗争正在如火如荼地开展着，汇合成了一股汹涌澎湃的洪流。特别是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的广泛传播和更加深入人心，向阿拉伯人民指引着前进的方向和胜利的道路。这一切表明，中东形势正在发生着深刻的变化。
    把斗争矛头指向美帝国主义
    美帝国主义多年来在中东推行的侵略政策的目标，就是要镇压日益高涨的阿拉伯民族解放运动，扑灭这个地区的武装斗争，维护它在中东的石油利益，夺取英、法老殖民主义的势力范围，控制这个具有重要战略意义的地区。
    但是，美国的侵略政策在阿拉伯人民的斗争面前处处碰壁，节节失败。就在去年六月美、以发动侵略战争以前，美国中央情报局在叙利亚、也门的颠覆阴谋被揭露，美国策动以色列对叙利亚等国的军事挑衅遭到反击，阿联宣布封锁亚喀巴湾并且要求美帝的侵略工具“联合国紧急部队”从阿联领土和加沙地区撤走。在这种情况下，美帝国主义在苏修领导集团的怂恿下，指使以色列，在去年六月五日发动了一场新的侵略阿拉伯国家的战争。
    在美帝国主义串通苏修集团迫使阿拉伯国家接受“停火”后，美帝伙同以色列变本加厉地玩弄武力镇压和政治诱降反革命两手策略，妄图逼迫阿拉伯国家接受丧权辱国的条件。美帝国主义的这种罪恶面目和它的阴险手法都已被广大的阿拉伯人民所识破。一位叙利亚青年说得好：“美帝国主义是阿拉伯人民的头号敌人，以色列犹太复国主义是美帝国主义在阿拉伯的侵略工具。”阿拉伯人民把斗争矛头牢牢地对准了美帝国主义。在阿拉伯国家风起云涌的群众性示威和集会中，在报纸刊物上，在其他种种场合，千千万万阿拉伯人民尖锐地揭露和痛斥美帝是阿拉伯人民的死敌，在政治上给了美帝国主义沉重的打击。美国《基督教科学箴言报》惴惴不安地说，“美国和苏联都在阿拉伯世界受到了粉碎性的打击”，美国在这个地区的“前途”由于阿拉伯人民的愤怒情绪“而受到深刻的和长期的损害”。
    走人民武装斗争的道路
    一年来，阿拉伯人民反帝斗争深入发展的最突出的标志是，巴勒斯坦人民武装斗争的火焰更猛烈地燃烧起来了。这是阿拉伯人民斗争的方向，胜利的希望。
    过去多少年，巴勒斯坦人民为了收复被侵占的土地，经历了种种曲折的斗争。然而，正如“法塔赫”（巴勒斯坦解放运动）一位负责人所说：“各种方法都使我们失望了，只有人民武装斗争才能解放巴勒斯坦。”“法塔赫”明确宣布拒绝美帝工具联合国对巴勒斯坦问题的所有“决议”和提出的一切“政治解决”的办法，坚决把武装斗争进行到底。
    一年来，不畏强暴的巴勒斯坦人民，战斗在反对美帝国主义和以色列侵略者的前哨，积极开展武装斗争，打得敌人狼狈不堪，取得了一个又一个的胜利。巴勒斯坦游击队员们冲破敌人的重重封锁线，在以色列占领区阿拉伯居民的掩护和配合下，采取机动灵活的游击战术，给了以色列侵略者数百次袭击和进攻。他们用手榴弹、机关枪、迫击炮、火箭筒和地雷，袭击和炸毁敌人的军营、军车、军事哨所、军火库、油库、油管、发电站、仓库和桥梁。他们炸伤了以色列国防部长达扬，打死两名以色列军区副司令，还炸死炸伤美国军事“专家”和“顾问”多名。今年三月下旬，以色列在美帝国主义唆使下向约旦发动大规模的武装袭击，巴勒斯坦游击战士和约旦军民一起奋起反击，给了以色列侵略军以沉重的打击。巴勒斯坦游击队捷报频传，大长了阿拉伯革命人民的志气，大灭了敌人的威风。以色列总理艾希科尔也不得不承认，以色列军队目前同巴勒斯坦游击队进行的战斗，要比去年六月“更加艰苦”。
    在中东出现的这一打击美帝国主义的武装斗争的战场，使深陷在全世界人民重重包围中的美帝国主义更加穷于应付，狼狈不堪。
    规模空前的示威浪潮
    一年来，阿拉伯人民声势浩大的反美示威游行，象大海的怒涛一样，一直在奔腾、呼啸。从地中海岸到红海之滨，从阿拉伯湾到大西洋沿岸，各国工人、农民、学生、教师以及其它阶层人民到处在举行示威游行，发出响彻云霄的反美怒吼。这股反美示威浪潮，规模之大，人数之多，持续之久，是阿拉伯历史上未有过的。
    在去年战火纷飞的日子里，成千成万的阿拉伯人象潮水般涌向街头。他们挥舞着拳头，愤怒声讨美帝国主义的滔天罪行。在许多阿拉伯国家里，示威群众砸烂美国使馆，捣毁美国侵略机构“文化中心”和图书馆，驱逐美国外交官，没收美国公司，抵制美国货，停止向美国供应石油，要求撤出美国军事基地……。
    近三个月来，叙利亚、阿联、伊拉克、约旦、黎巴嫩和被以色列占领的阿拉伯地区，连续出现了三次示威高潮：三月底爆发的示威游行，谴责美帝指使以色列大举侵犯约旦河东岸的约旦阵地；四月底五月初进行的示威，抗议美帝支持下的以色列侵略者在耶路撒冷市举行挑衅性的军事检阅，对阿拉伯人民进行新的战争讹诈；五月中掀起的示威高潮，声讨美以侵略罪行，并表示支持巴勒斯坦人民拿起武器解放家园。
    这一年来，阿拉伯人民在示威中，旗帜鲜明。他们高喊：“美帝国主义是阿拉伯人民的头号敌人！”“苏修是美帝的头号帮凶！”“以色列和联合国是美帝的侵略工具！”这些响亮的口号标志着阿拉伯人民的新觉醒。
    在这场反侵略的斗争中，阿拉伯各国人民在各条战线上，互相帮助，互相配合，互相支持。巴勒斯坦人民在以色列占领区和战前以色列的统治区内开辟新战场，进行游击战争，狠狠打击侵略者。他们这一行动对其他阿拉伯国家人民反对美以侵略的斗争是最有力的支持。而其他阿拉伯国家人民则通过向巴勒斯坦游击队提供训练基地，掩护和配合他们的游击活动，以及为他们开展捐款运动等办法，来支持巴勒斯坦人民的武装斗争。面对着最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义，越来越多的阿拉伯人民开始认识到，只要一亿阿拉伯人民更加紧密地团结起来，建立起一个广泛的反美统一战线，那么就可以在阿拉伯大地上筑起一道反对美以侵略的铜墙铁壁。
    毛泽东思想是指路明灯
    在抗击美帝国主义和以色列侵略者的斗争中，越来越多的阿拉伯革命人民纷纷指出，伟大的毛泽东思想是他们的指路明灯，是他们克敌制胜的最锐利的武器。在阿拉伯人民殷切期望下，毛主席的光辉著作《抗日游击战争的战略问题》、《论持久战》、《毛泽东军事文选》、《毛泽东选集》第三卷和《毛主席语录》的阿拉伯文版，去年下半年相继在叙利亚、黎巴嫩和阿联的首都出版和发行。许多阿拉伯革命者如饥似渴地学习毛主席的光辉著作，从中找到了革命的真理，明确了斗争的方向，得到了进行战斗的勇气和力量。不少阿拉伯朋友学习了毛主席著作后热情赞扬说，毛泽东思想是反对帝国主义的强大思想武器，是阿拉伯人民同美帝国主义及其走狗以色列进行斗争的行动指南。巴勒斯坦游击战士说：“毛主席为我们指出了解放巴勒斯坦的道路，即人民战争的道路。”
    阿拉伯人民通过对毛主席著作的学习逐渐懂得，尽管他们的斗争是曲折的、艰巨的、长期的，但是他们的前途是光明的。许多阿拉伯英雄儿女庄严宣誓：走武装斗争的道路，发动广大群众，依靠人民战争，从各方面向美帝国主义及其走狗以色列发动持久的猛烈的进攻！
    目前，美帝国主义在世界上到处横行霸道，对许多国家进行干涉、控制、颠覆、侵略。正如伟大领袖毛主席所指出的：“美帝国主义的手伸得太长了。它每侵略一个地方，就把一条新的绞索套在自己的脖子上。它已经陷入全世界人民的重重包围之中。”阿拉伯各国人民一定会加强团结，坚持斗争，美帝国主义的任何军事冒险和政治欺骗都是注定要失败的。胜利一定属于英雄的阿拉伯人民。（附图片）
    去年，阿尔及利亚数千群众在阿尔及尔举行盛大的示威游行，示威群众高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！”“苏修是叛徒！”等口号。
