Tanzanian ruling party's newspaper publishes editorial noting the victory and progress of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the significant meaning of President Nyerere's visit to China

	NEW DELHI, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The English and Swahili editions of the Tanzanian ruling party TANU's organ, "The Nationalist" and "Uhuru," published editorials on June 17, welcoming President Nyerere's second visit to China.

	The editorial in "The Nationalist" stressed that President Nyerere's visit will undoubtedly consolidate the friendly relations and anti-imperialist friendship between the peoples of Tanzania and China.

	The editorial pointed out that since President Nyerere's first visit to China and Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Tanzania in 1965, "the relations between China and Tanzania have made a leap forward, and the friendship between the two peoples has overcome all obstacles and reached an unprecedentedly friendly level."

	The editorial pointed out that on the anti-imperialist front, Tanzania and China have supported each other, exposed and foiled all the plots and tricks that imperialism has devised in the past and recently to sabotage the progress of the peoples of Tanzania and China.

	The editorial praised the close and fruitful cooperation between the two countries. The editorial mentioned some factories and farms that China has helped Tanzania to build, and especially mentioned the Tanzania-Zambia Railway, which is being surveyed and constructed with Chinese aid.

	The editorial pointed out the significance of President Nyerere's visit to China at a time when China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is making victorious progress.

	The editorial in "Uhuru" pointed out that the friendship between Tanzania and China is a lasting and developing true friendship. President Nyerere's visit to China this time will further strengthen the friendship between the peoples of the two countries in their common struggle against imperialism and colonialism.
