The secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists' Association issued a statement on June 7, reaffirming its resolute support for the struggle of the Arab people, especially the Palestinian people's just struggle against U.S.-led imperialism and Zionism.

The statement said that the imperialists instigated Israel to launch an aggressive war on June 5 last year, fully exposing the vicious nature of U.S. imperialism and its tool, Israel, to the Arab people. The Arab people, especially the Palestinian people, through their own bitter experiences, have come to realize the truth pointed out by Chairman Mao: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." Under the leadership of "Fatah" (Palestine Liberation Movement) and its military organization "Storm," the Palestinian people have opened up the path to liberate occupied Palestine, which is the path of relying on the masses and resolutely using revolutionary violence to counter the reactionary violence of imperialism and Zionism.

The statement said that the revolutionary Arab people firmly believe that U.S. imperialism is the number one enemy of the Arab people and the people of the world, and that Israel is merely a tool of the imperialist powers. To liberate occupied Palestine, it is necessary to engage in a head-on struggle with U.S.-led imperialism and to resolutely fight against the Soviet revisionist ruling clique, which is the accomplice of U.S. imperialism. The Arab people, especially the Palestinian people, who insist on protracted armed struggle, will surely achieve victory. The statement calls on all revolutionary journalists in Asia and Africa and all revolutionary people of the world to thoroughly expose the nature of this illegal colonialist state, Israel, and to fully support the Arab people, especially the Palestinian people, in their just struggle against U.S.-led imperialism, Zionism, and Soviet revisionism centered on the Soviet Union, and for the complete liberation of occupied Palestine.

    新华社讯　亚非新闻工作者协会书记处七日发表声明，重申坚决支持阿拉伯人民的斗争，特别是巴勒斯坦人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义、犹太复国主义的正义斗争。
    声明说，帝国主义者唆使以色列在去年六月五日发动了一场侵略战争，向阿拉伯人民彻底暴露了美帝国主义和它的工具以色列的凶恶本性。阿拉伯人民，特别是巴勒斯坦人民通过他们自己的惨痛经验，认识到毛主席所指出的真理：“枪杆子里面出政权”。巴勒斯坦人民在“法塔赫”（巴勒斯坦解放运动）和它的军事组织“暴风”的领导下，开辟了解放被占领的巴勒斯坦的道路，这就是通过依靠群众、坚决以革命的暴力对付帝国主义和犹太复国主义的反动暴力的道路。
    声明说，革命的阿拉伯人民坚决认为，美帝国主义是阿拉伯人民和世界人民的头号敌人，以色列只是帝国主义列强的工具，为了解放被占领的巴勒斯坦，必须同以美国为首的帝国主义进行针锋相对的斗争，必须同美帝的帮凶苏修统治集团进行坚决的斗争。坚持持久的武装斗争的阿拉伯人民，特别是巴勒斯坦人民必将获得胜利。声明号召全体亚非革命的新闻工作者和全世界革命人民，彻底揭露这个非法殖民者国家以色列的本性，全力支持阿拉伯人民，特别是巴勒斯坦人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义、犹太复国主义、以苏修为中心的修正主义，以及为争取被占领的巴勒斯坦的彻底解放所进行的正义斗争。
