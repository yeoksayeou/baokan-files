In the great situation of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, revolutionary youth in Heilongjiang Province, under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao, actively go to the mountains and countryside, taking the brilliant path of integrating with the workers and peasants. Since March this year, the province has already sent 20,000 urban youth to settle down in rural areas and border regions.

Among these youth who go to the mountains and countryside, some were previously responsible for the Red Guards' Revolutionary Committee in cities and counties, some were members of the school Revolutionary Committee, and many were active in studying Mao Zedong Thought. During the stormy Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they actively participated in the struggle against the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in education, led by China's Khrushchev and his clique within the Party. They also criticized the "selfish" thoughts in their own minds, significantly raising their proletarian consciousness. Through two years of practice in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have deeply felt the great significance of Chairman Mao's teaching: "Youth and students must integrate with the broad masses of workers and peasants." They say, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'How do we judge whether a young person is revolutionary or not? What standard do we use to judge? There is only one standard, that is, whether they are willing to and actually integrate with the broad masses of workers and peasants.' We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, go to the workers and peasants, take the path of integrating with them, and temper ourselves into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause who are forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line."

In the tide of going to the mountains and countryside, revolutionary youth, following Chairman Mao's teaching, "We go to work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go there, this is what a good comrade should do," consciously take on heavy responsibilities and go to the most arduous places. The deputy head of the Revolutionary Committee of the Third Middle School in Harbin, Wang Rong, and seven classmates, firmly requested to go to the border county of Raohe to be ordinary commune members. After arriving in Raohe, they chose two relatively poor production brigades to settle down. The commune members said, "Our conditions are not good here." They firmly replied, "We want to temper ourselves in places with poor conditions, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants to change the world and change our worldview." Many youth allocated to state farms also rushed to request to go to farms with poor conditions and many difficulties.

In organizing urban youth to go to the mountains and countryside, the revolutionary committees at various levels in Heilongjiang Province insisted on taking Mao Zedong Thought as the banner, emphasizing proletarian politics. They held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, organizing youth to study Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Old Three Articles" and "The Direction of the Youth Movement," fiercely criticizing China's Khrushchev and his agents in Heilongjiang Province who advocated "individual struggle" and "fame and fortune" among youth, and exposing the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies. They also mobilized the masses to smash the enemy's various plots to sabotage youth going to the mountains and countryside, raising the proletarian consciousness and class struggle consciousness of the youth. Revolutionary committees at various places also, through activities such as lectures on actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, bitter memory and sweet memory meetings, on-site meetings, and report meetings, conducted in-depth and detailed ideological and political work on the youth, effectively promoting the youth's ideological revolutionization.

The action of revolutionary youth going to the mountains and countryside received active support and enthusiastic encouragement from revolutionary parents. Many leading cadres of revolutionary committees at various levels actively supported their children going to the mountains and countryside. Li Shuxian, a representative of the second Heilongjiang Province conference of active learners and appliers of Mao Zedong Thought and a family member of a worker from Qiqihar Railway Bureau, sent her two daughters to the countryside in one go to participate in the socialist construction of the countryside. Many revolutionary parents, when sending their children on the revolutionary journey, enthusiastically instructed their children to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

    听毛主席的话坚决走与工农相结合的道路
    黑龙江省两万名城镇知识青年到农村和边疆安家落户
    新华社哈尔滨二十一日电　在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大好形势下，黑龙江省广大革命知识青年遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，积极上山下乡，走与工农群众相结合的光辉道路。从今年三月份以来，全省已有两万名城镇知识青年到农村和边疆去安家落户。
    在这批上山下乡的革命小将当中，有的曾经是市、县中学红代会的负责人，有的曾经是学校革命委员会的成员，还有许多是学习毛泽东思想积极分子。他们在无产阶级文化大革命的急风暴雨中，大造了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派的反，狠批了反革命修正主义教育路线，同时，狠斗了自己头脑中的“私”字，无产阶级觉悟得到很大提高。经过两年来无产阶级文化大革命的实践，他们更加亲切地体会到毛主席教导的“知识青年和学生青年一定要和广大的工农群众结合在一块”的伟大意义。他们说，毛主席教导我们：“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。”我们一定遵照毛主席的教导，到工农中去，走与工农相结合的道路，把自己锻炼成为永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席革命路线的无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人。
    在上山下乡的热潮中，广大革命知识青年遵照毛主席“我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志”的教导，自觉地拣重担子挑，到最艰苦的地方去。哈尔滨市第三中学革委会副主任王荣和七名同学，坚决要求到祖国边疆饶河县去当普通社员。到达饶河以后，他们又选了两个不大富裕的生产队去安家。社员们说：“我们这里条件不好。”他们坚定地回答说：“我们就是要在条件不好的地方锻炼自己，和贫下中农一起改天换地，同时改造自己的世界观。”分配到国营农场去的许多知识青年，也纷纷要求到条件差、困难多的农场里去。
    黑龙江省各级革命委员会在组织城镇知识青年上山下乡的时候，坚持以毛泽东思想挂帅，突出无产阶级政治。他们举办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，组织青年们学习毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”和《青年运动的方向》，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在黑龙江省的代理人在知识青年中鼓吹的“个人奋斗”“成名成家”等反革命修正主义谬论，并且发动群众粉碎了阶级敌人妄图破坏知识青年上山下乡的种种阴谋，提高了知识青年的无产阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟。各地革命委员会还通过活学活用毛泽东思想讲用会、忆苦思甜会、现场会、报告会等形式，对知识青年进行深入细致的思想政治工作，有力地促进了知识青年的思想革命化。
    革命知识青年上山下乡的行动，得到广大革命家长的积极支持和热情鼓励。各级革命委员会的许多领导干部，积极支持自己的子女上山下乡。出席黑龙江省第二次活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会代表、齐齐哈尔铁路局职工家属李淑娴，一次就把自己的两个女儿送往农村，参加农村社会主义建设。许多革命家长在欢送自己的子女踏上革命征途时，热情嘱咐孩子们要好好读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。
