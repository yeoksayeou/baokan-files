Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Never forget class struggle." Only by constantly remembering class struggle and using the perspective of class struggle to observe, analyze, and handle all matters that arise on our path forward, can we stand firm in the face of the storms and waves of class struggle, see clearly the direction, and expose and smash all the tricks and schemes of the class enemy.

However, the Chinese Khrushchev preaches to the up-to-the-mountains and down-to-the-countryside youth: "When you go to the countryside, if you see some incorrect things, don't be displeased. You are young and lack experience. Even if something is wrong, you should speak out less for two or three years, at least three to five years less talk, less criticism." He even says: "If you see illegal and disorderly acts, don't say anything, you can endure it for a while." The Chinese Khrushchev deliberately obscures class struggle, opposing Chairman Mao's great directive of "criticize errors and fight against poisonous weeds." His evil purpose is to attempt to bind our hands and feet with "don't say," "endure," "less criticism," and so on, to blur our class struggle consciousness, to numb our revolutionary will, so that he can brazenly restore capitalism.

The Chinese Khrushchev's schemes will never succeed! The youth armed with Mao Zedong Thought will never relax their class vigilance for a moment. Towards the Chinese Khrushchev's capitalist restoration activities, we will not endure for even a second, we will not say less, we will not criticize less; towards the counter-revolutionary revisionist line he promotes, we will expose and criticize it thoroughly, and completely eliminate its poisonous influence.

Chairman Mao teaches us that we must heighten our class vigilance. "If we lose our vigilance, we will be easily deceived and suffer great losses. No matter where counter-revolutionaries cause trouble, we must resolutely eliminate them." Chairman Mao's teachings make us deeply understand that if we do not speak of class struggle for a day, our class struggle consciousness will weaken, and the class enemy will take advantage of the opportunity; our endurance towards the enemy's attacks is a betrayal of the revolutionary cause; if we do not carry out revolutionary criticism, we will not be able to distinguish between the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie and the revolutionary line of the proletariat, and we will stand on the wrong side and take the wrong path.

Therefore, the fifteen female militia members of our Forest Farm Brigade Down-to-the-Countryside Youth Militia Class, since we moved to the countryside in the spring of 1966, have grasped the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, and opened fire on the Chinese Khrushchev and attacked the "self" in our minds. Together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, we praise Chairman Mao's great achievements and criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's heinous crimes. In the production team, in the youth point, and in everyone's mind, the battlefield of class struggle has been set up. The more we fight against selfishness, the larger the "public" position becomes; the more we criticize revisionism, the deeper Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line takes root in our minds.

Last January, the class enemy stirred up a counter-revolutionary wind of economicism. They used the name of "rebellion" to incite the down-to-the-countryside youth to return to the city to settle down and find work. At that time, we also studied Chairman Mao's brilliant work "The Direction of the Youth Movement." Chairman Mao earnestly admonishes us: "If he today combines himself with the workers and peasants, he today is revolutionary; but if he tomorrow does not combine himself with them, or even oppresses the people, then he is not revolutionary, or he is counter-revolutionary." Under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, we realized that the up-to-the-mountains and down-to-the-countryside movement of the youth is Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and the class enemy's incitement for the down-to-the-countryside youth to return to the city is to make us deviate from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Everyone unanimously said: "Our hometown is not in the city, but in the countryside. We will take root in the countryside and make revolution on the spot." We insisted on seizing the revolution and promoting production, together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, wrote big-character posters, wrote critical articles, and launched a resolute struggle against the class enemy. Through the struggle, we repelled the class enemy's arrogant attack and further strengthened our resolve to combine with the workers and peasants.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Socialism is a fairly long historical stage. In this historical stage of socialism, there still exist classes, class contradictions, and class struggle, there is a struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism, and there is the danger of capitalist restoration. We must recognize the long-term and complex nature of this struggle. We must heighten our vigilance." Under socialist conditions, the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is long-term, sharp, and complex. Similarly, in the struggle of the youth to go up to the mountains and down to the countryside and combine with the workers and peasants, the struggle between the two classes and the two worldviews is also long-term, sharp, and complex. We must use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a powerful ideological weapon, constantly fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism, and resolutely defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

    对敌人进攻的“忍耐”  就是对革命的背叛
    辽宁省金县林场大队下乡青年民兵班女民兵
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争。”只有念念不忘阶级斗争，用阶级斗争的观点去观察、分析和处理我们前进路上发生的一切事情，才能在阶级斗争的大风大浪中站稳立场，看清方向，识破和粉碎阶级敌人的一切阴谋诡计。
    可是，中国赫鲁晓夫向上山下乡知识青年宣扬什么：“你们到乡里，看见有些不正确的事情，不要看不惯。你们年轻，没有经验。即使不对的事两三年内也要少提意见，至少三年到五年少讲话，少批评。”他甚至说：“看见违法乱纪的事情，也不要讲，可以暂时忍耐一下。”中国赫鲁晓夫极力抹煞阶级斗争，对抗毛主席的“有错误就得批判，有毒草就得进行斗争”的伟大指示。他的罪恶目的就是妄想用“不要讲”、“忍耐”、“少批评”等等束缚我们的手脚，模糊我们的阶级斗争观念，麻痹我们的革命意志，好让他放肆地复辟资本主义。
    中国赫鲁晓夫的阴谋，是永远不会得逞的！用毛泽东思想武装起来的知识青年，一刻也不松懈自己的阶级警惕性。对中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的罪恶活动，我们就是一分一秒也不能忍耐，一句也不能少讲，一点也不能少批判；对他所推行的反革命修正主义路线，我们就是要狠揭、狠批，彻底肃清它的流毒。
    毛主席教导我们必须提高阶级警惕性。“如果我们丧失警惕性，那就会上大当，吃大亏。不管什么地方出现反革命分子捣乱，就应当坚决消灭他。”毛主席的教导使我们深深懂得，一天不讲阶级斗争，阶级斗争的观念就要淡薄，阶级敌人就乘虚而入；我们对敌人的进攻“忍耐”，就是对革命事业的背叛；我们不搞革命的大批判，就分不清什么是资产阶级反动路线，什么是无产阶级革命路线，就要站错队，走错路。
    因此，我们林场大队下乡青年民兵班十五名女民兵，从一九六六年春到农村落户后，就抓住了两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争这条纲，向中国赫鲁晓夫开火，向自己头脑中的“私”字进攻。我们同广大贫下中农一起，歌颂毛主席的丰功伟绩，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的滔天罪行。在生产队，在青年点，在每个人的头脑里，都摆开了阶级斗争的战场。越斗私，“公”字的阵地就越大；越批修，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线在头脑里扎根就越深。
    去年一月份，阶级敌人刮起了一股反革命经济主义的妖风。他们以“造反”的名义，煽动下乡青年回城市落户口，找工作。当时，我们又学习了毛主席的《青年运动的方向》这篇光辉著作。毛主席谆谆告诫我们：“他今天把自己结合于工农群众，他今天是革命的；但是如果他明天不去结合了，或者反过来压迫老百姓，那就是不革命的，或者是反革命的了。”在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，我们认识到知识青年上山下乡是毛主席的革命路线，阶级敌人煽动我们下乡知识青年回城市，就是要使我们离开毛主席的革命路线。大家异口同声地说：“我们的老家不在城市，而在农村。我们要扎根农村，就地闹革命。”我们坚持抓革命、促生产，同广大贫下中农一起写大字报，写批判文章，向阶级敌人展开了坚决的斗争。通过斗争，我们打退了阶级敌人的猖狂进攻，并且更加坚定了自己同工农群众相结合的决心。
    毛主席教导我们：“社会主义社会是一个相当长的历史阶段。在社会主义这个历史阶段中，还存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，存在着社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争，存在着资本主义复辟的危险性。要认识这种斗争的长期性和复杂性。要提高警惕。”在社会主义条件下，无产阶级同资产阶级的斗争是长期的、尖锐的、复杂的。同样，在知识青年上山下乡同工农群众相结合的道路上，两个阶级、两种世界观的斗争也是长期的、尖锐的、复杂的。我们一定要以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为强大的思想武器，不断地斗私批修，誓死捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线！
