In March of this year, when the fascist military clique leader Suharto of Indonesia climbed onto the "presidential" throne with the help of bayonets, the Soviet revisionist *Pravda* published a series of articles and news items, praising this American imperialist lackey, whose hands are stained with the blood of the Indonesian revolutionary people, as a "national hero" and an "outstanding leader" of Indonesia. They even absurdly claimed that he was a "general" who "participated in the liberation of West Irian."

The Soviet revisionists' shameless praise of Suharto is not an isolated incident. This is because the Soviet revisionist clique itself is a counter-revolutionary group that is anti-communist and anti-people, a lackey and servant of American imperialism. Therefore, they naturally regard Suharto and his ilk as "heroes" and consider them their soulmates.

Suharto and his ilk have "achieved" much in their anti-China, anti-communist, and anti-people activities, earning high praise from American imperialism. U.S. Secretary of State Rusk considers the "Suharto regime" to be the "center of a new wind in Asia." This reveals that American imperialism's support for the Indonesian fascist military regime is aimed at making Indonesia a new center of anti-China and anti-communist activities in Southeast Asia. This will align with the "old" anti-China and anti-communist centers of India and Japan, forming a so-called "crescent-shaped" encirclement of China. The American masters want to do this, and the Soviet revisionists rush to assist, frantically operating their propaganda machines to lavishly praise Suharto and actively create favorable public opinion for the Indonesian fascist military regime.

On November 3 last year, Soviet revisionist leader Brezhnev in Moscow spoke at length about the Soviet revisionists' foreign policy, claiming it to be "internationalist" and "thoroughly revolutionary," and that it "resolutely rejects... secret diplomatic maneuvers and collusion behind the backs of the peoples of various countries." They boast endlessly, sounding so good. But after all the fine words, they commit heinous deeds! Look:

The Soviet revisionist clique, out of counter-revolutionary needs, openly supports and incites the Indonesian fascist military regime to repeatedly launch anti-China and anti-Chinese waves. The American imperialists lavishly praise Suharto and his ilk's anti-China actions, and the Soviet revisionists join in the applause. On November 4 last year, one of the leaders of the Indonesian "Cooperative Parliament," Hussein Khatta Sasmita, revealed in a talk with reporters upon his return from the Soviet Union to Jakarta that Indonesia's severance of diplomatic relations with China was "very warmly welcomed" by the Soviet revisionists, and that the Soviet leaders "obviously understood and highly appreciated the firm stance of the Indonesian government." This further exposes the Soviet revisionists' ugly collusion with reactionaries of various countries in their frenzied anti-China activities, and also makes people realize what kind of goods the Soviet revisionists' boasted "internationalist foreign policy" really is!

On November 7 last year, Soviet revisionist Ambassador to Indonesia, Sedyanko, openly declared in Jakarta that the Indonesian fascist military regime led by Suharto is an "anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist" regime. He also said that the anti-communist, anti-China, and anti-revolutionary program adopted by the Indonesian "Temporary People's Consultative Assembly" in 1966 "can become the basis for further developing friendly relations and cooperation" between the Soviet revisionists and the Indonesian reactionaries. The more counter-revolutionary the forces are, the more the Soviet revisionists want to develop "friendly cooperation" with them. This is the so-called "thoroughly revolutionary" foreign policy of the Soviet revisionists!

The Soviet revisionists are also stepping up economic and military aid to the Indonesian reactionaries. Soviet capital is heavily infiltrating Indonesia, sucking the blood and sweat of the Indonesian people. The Soviet revisionists have also provided the Indonesian fascist military regime with a large amount of weapons and ammunition, helping the Indonesian reactionaries to massacre the Indonesian people and suppress the revolutionary armed struggle of the Indonesian people. Look, how ferocious is the counter-revolutionary face of the Soviet revisionists!

Despite the Soviet revisionists' frantic efforts to put gold on the face of the Indonesian fascist military regime, to infuse it with large amounts of blood, and to instigate Suharto and his ilk to concoct new anti-China military alliances, as our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out, the various persecutions that the reactionaries of various countries inflict on the revolutionary people will, in the end, only promote the broader and more intense revolution of the people. The revolutionary storm of the Indonesian people will surely dispel the dark clouds hanging over this beautiful archipelago, and a new Indonesia of the people will surely be born in the flames of revolution.

    印尼反动派的知己
    暨东兵
    今年三月，当印尼法西斯军人集团头目苏哈托靠着刺刀爬上“总统”宝座时，苏修《真理报》接连发表文章和消息，把这个美帝走狗、双手沾满印尼革命人民鲜血的大刽子手、印尼人民的公敌，肉麻地吹捧为印尼的“民族英雄”和“杰出的领导人”，还胡说什么他是“参加过解放西伊里安”的“将军”。
    苏修《真理报》这样无耻地吹捧苏哈托，绝不是偶然的现象。因为苏修集团自己就是反共反人民的反革命派，是美帝的帮凶和奴仆，所以他们很自然地把苏哈托之流看作“英雄”，引为知己。
    苏哈托之流反华、反共、反人民“有功”，获得了美帝的高度“评价”。美国国务卿腊斯克认为“苏哈托体制”是“亚洲新风的中心”。这就一语道破美帝扶植印尼法西斯军人政权，就是要使印尼成为东南亚反华反共的一个新的中心，好同“旧”的反华反共中心的印度和日本连成一气，形成所谓“新月形”的反华包围圈。美国主子要这样干，苏修就赶紧效劳，拚命开动宣传机器，大肆吹捧苏哈托，积极为印尼法西斯军人政权制造有利的舆论。
    去年十一月三日，苏修头子勃列日涅夫在莫斯科曾大谈苏修的对外政策，说它是什么“国际主义的”，“其全部内容是彻底革命的”，“坚决摒弃了……秘密外交手腕和在各国人民背后进行勾结的政策”。吹得天花乱坠，何等好听。但是，好话说尽，坏事做绝！你看：
    苏修集团出于反革命的需要，伙同美帝明目张胆地支持和怂恿印尼法西斯军人政权一再掀起反华排华浪潮。对于苏哈托之流的反华行径，美帝大肆夸赞，苏修同声喝采。去年十一月四日，印尼“合作国会”头目之一侯赛因·卡塔萨斯米塔自苏联返回雅加达时对记者发表谈话透露，印尼中断同中国的外交关系，受到了苏修“十分令人好感的欢迎”，“苏联领导人……显然表示理解并十分赞赏印尼政府的这一坚决态度”。这使人们进一步看清苏修勾结各国反动派疯狂反华的丑恶嘴脸，也使人们认识到苏修所吹嘘的“国际主义的外交政策”到底是什么货色！
    苏修驻印尼大使塞坚科去年十一月七日在雅加达讲话时公然宣称，以苏哈托为首的印尼法西斯军人政权是什么“反对帝国主义和殖民主义的”政权，还说什么印尼“临时人民协商会议”在一九六六年通过的反共、反华、反革命纲领，“可以成为进一步发展”苏修同印尼反动派之间的“友好关系和合作的基础”。越是反革命的势力，苏修越要同它们发展“友好合作”关系。这就是苏修所谓的“彻底革命”的外交政策！
    苏修还加紧从经济及军备方面“援助”印尼反动派。苏修资本大量侵入印尼，吮吸印尼人民的血汗。苏修还向印尼法西斯军人政权提供了大量的武器、弹药，帮助印尼反动派屠杀印尼人民和镇压印尼人民的革命武装斗争。请看，苏修的反革命嘴脸是何等狰狞！
    尽管苏修拚命在印尼法西斯军人政权脸上贴金，大量为它输血，并唆使苏哈托之流拼凑新的反华军事同盟，但是，正如我们的伟大领袖毛主席所指出的，各国反动派“对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命”。印尼人民的革命风暴，必将驱散笼罩在这个美丽的千岛之国的阴云，一个人民的新印尼一定会在革命的烈火中诞生。
