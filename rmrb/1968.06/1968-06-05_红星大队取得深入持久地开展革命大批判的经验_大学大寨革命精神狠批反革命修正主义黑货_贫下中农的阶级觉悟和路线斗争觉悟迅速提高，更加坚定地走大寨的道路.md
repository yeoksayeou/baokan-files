Red Star Brigade of Henan's Xie County has, in conjunction with the campaign to learn from Dazhai in agriculture, carried out deep and persistent revolutionary criticism, promoting the ideological transformation of people and consolidating and developing collective production.

Revolutionary criticism is a powerful driving force for learning from Dazhai

How to carry out deep and persistent revolutionary criticism in a production brigade and how to closely combine revolution with production? The experience of Red Star Brigade is: the best way is to combine revolutionary criticism with the campaign to learn from Dazhai in agriculture.

The revolutionary cadres of Red Star Brigade say: "Learning from Dazhai in agriculture" is the great call made by Chairman Mao to us. The Dazhai path represents Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in the countryside. Whether to learn from Dazhai or not, whether to follow the Dazhai path or not, is a major issue of whether to implement or not Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. While Liu Shaoqi, the Chinese Khrushchev, is pushing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the countryside, aiming to sabotage the campaign to learn from Dazhai in agriculture and attempting to restore capitalism in the countryside. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction; without blocking, there can be no flow; without stopping, there can be no progress." Only by thoroughly eliminating all the revisionist poison of the Chinese Khrushchev can we truly learn the revolutionary spirit of Dazhai, which emphasizes proletarian politics, self-reliance, striving for progress, and farming for revolution. Therefore, revolutionary criticism is a powerful driving force for learning from Dazhai.

To effectively combine revolutionary criticism with the campaign to learn from Dazhai and to carry out deep and persistent revolutionary criticism, the leading cadre of this brigade has guided the commune members to focus on several deeply rooted revisionist poisons in this brigade, such as the theory of "class struggle extinction," "four freedoms," "three selfs and one package," "material incentives," and "work points as the key," and to systematically, purposefully, and step-by-step expose and criticize them.

Severely criticize revisionist poisons and learn the revolutionary spirit of Dazhai

In the revolutionary criticism, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants of Red Star Brigade, armed with Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle," first focused on class struggle, exposing several landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who had not been reformed, and revealing their crimes of spreading rumors, instigating trouble, and maliciously sabotaging the campaign to learn from Dazhai. A large number of living facts tore off the mask of the Chinese Khrushchev's theory of "class struggle extinction," opened the eyes of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and made them realize that the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who had not been reformed are the black claws of the Chinese Khrushchev. They hate most the poor and lower-middle peasants responding to Chairman Mao's call to follow the Dazhai path and live a happy life. They are the stumbling blocks on the Dazhai path and the live targets of revolutionary criticism.

Next, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres exposed many facts, illustrating the serious consequences of implementing the "three selfs and one package" poison of the Chinese Khrushchev in recent years. Everyone angrily said: The "four freedoms" and "three selfs and one package" poisons pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev are attempts to make us go back on our path and suffer twice. We will not agree to this, not even a thousand times, not even ten thousand times.

Self-reliance and striving for progress are the most precious spirit of the Dazhai people. In the revolutionary criticism, the commune members criticized the "two hands up" mentality of "waiting for loans when lacking money, waiting for machines when plowing, and waiting for fertilizers when increasing production," severely denouncing the Chinese Khrushchev's crime of promoting "material incentives." This spring, some people in the brigade advocated using more than 3,000 yuan of public accumulation funds to build the brigade's office. The poor and lower-middle peasants resisted this wrong proposal, investing this money in spring plowing production and simultaneously returning the state's relief funds.

The issue of work points is the focal point of the struggle between "public" and "private" and the two-line struggle in the countryside. In the revolutionary criticism, the commune members extensively exposed the harm done by the Chinese Khrushchev, implementing the "small contract" for farm work, resulting in the evil consequences of "fast contract work, slow white work, and not working if work points are few." They exposed the evil plot of the Chinese Khrushchev pushing "work points as the key." Through revolutionary criticism, the second production team learned from Dazhai's management methods and the experience of carrying out activities with a single-minded devotion to the public, which was quickly promoted throughout the brigade. A large number of good commune members with a single-minded devotion to the public emerged.

Listen to Chairman Mao's words and resolutely follow the Dazhai path

This revolutionary criticism combined with learning from Dazhai quickly raised the class consciousness and line struggle consciousness of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. The more they hate the Chinese Khrushchev, the more they love Chairman Mao; the more they detest the bourgeois reactionary line, the more they are loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and the more resolute they are in following the Dazhai path.

While carrying out revolutionary criticism, Red Star Brigade also organized the commune members to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, insisting on positive education, combining the struggle against selfishness with the struggle against revisionism, eliminating the poison of the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionism in their own minds, and establishing a worldview of farming for revolution.

Shi Wenhai, a militia cadre of the first production team, after studying the "Three Constantly Read Articles," compared his own mistakes of cultivating small plots of wasteland and not working well in collective fields, and denounced the harm done by the Chinese Khrushchev's advocacy of "four freedoms" and "three selfs and one package." From then on, he went to work early, returned late, chose heavy tasks, and helped the families of soldiers in his spare time, doing many good deeds with a single-minded devotion to the public, and was praised by the commune members. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants deeply felt: to make revolution, one must listen to Chairman Mao's words; to farm, one must follow the Dazhai path.

Revolutionary criticism combined with learning from Dazhai has become the locomotive driving production forward. Chairman Mao's great instruction of "grasp revolution and promote production" has been implemented. The entire brigade has seen a mass movement of drought resistance and summer sowing.

    大学大寨革命精神狠批反革命修正主义黑货
    贫下中农的阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟迅速提高，更加坚定地走大寨的道路
    本报讯　河南汲县红星公社红星大队，结合农业学大寨的活动，深入持久地开展革命大批判，促进了人的思想革命化，推动了集体生产的巩固和发展。
    革命大批判是学大寨的巨大推动力
    在一个农村生产大队里，怎样深入持久地把革命大批判坚持下去、不停顿地向阶级敌人进攻？怎样把革命和生产密切结合起来？红星大队的经验是：最好的办法是把革命大批判与农业学大寨的活动结合起来。
    红星大队的革命干部们说：“农业学大寨”是毛主席向我们发出的伟大号召，大寨道路代表着毛主席在农村的无产阶级革命路线，学不学大寨，走不走大寨道路，是执行不执行毛主席革命路线的大是大非问题。而中国赫鲁晓夫在农村推行的反革命修正主义路线，就是要破坏农业学大寨的运动，企图在农村复辟资本主义。毛主席教导我们：“不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行”。只有清除中国赫鲁晓夫的一切修正主义流毒，才能把大寨突出无产阶级政治、自力更生、奋发图强、为革命种田的革命精神学到手。所以，革命大批判是学大寨的巨大推动力。
    为了把革命大批判和学大寨活动很好地结合起来，把革命大批判深入持久地开展下去，这个大队的领导班子，引导社员重点抓住中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论、“四大自由”、“三自一包”、“物质刺激”、“工分挂帅”等几个在本大队里流毒最深的修正主义黑货，有计划、有目的、有步骤地加以深揭猛批。
    狠批修正主义黑货大学大寨革命精神
    在革命大批判中，红星大队的广大贫下中农以毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导为武器，首先大抓阶级斗争，揪出了几个没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，揭露了他们煽阴风，点鬼火，恶毒破坏学大寨活动的罪行。大量活生生的事实，撕破了中国赫鲁晓夫散布的“阶级斗争熄灭”论的画皮，擦亮了贫下中农的眼睛，使他们认识到，党内一小撮走资派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，是中国赫鲁晓夫的黑爪牙，他们最恨贫下中农响应毛主席的号召，走大寨的道路，过幸福生活。他们是走大寨道路的绊脚石，是革命大批判的活靶子。
    接着，广大贫下中农和革命干部揭发了许多事实，说明前些年推行中国赫鲁晓夫的“三自一包”黑货削弱了集体经济的严重后果。大家愤怒地说：中国赫鲁晓夫推行的“四大自由”、“三自一包”黑货，是妄图要我们走回头路，吃二遍苦，我们一千个不答应，一万个不答应。
    自力更生，奋发图强，是大寨人最可宝贵的精神。在革命大批判中，社员们批判了“两手向上”的“三等思想”（缺钱等贷款、犁地等机器、增产等化肥），痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫搞“物质刺激”的罪行。今年春天，大队里有一些人主张把三千多元的公积金用来盖大队的办公室，贫下中农抵制了这种错误主张，把这笔款投入了春耕生产，同时退还了国家的救济金。
    工分问题，是农村中“公”与“私”斗争、两条路线斗争的焦点。在革命大批判中，社员们大摆中国赫鲁晓夫的毒害，实行农活“小包工”，以致出现“包工快，白工磨，工分少了不干活”的恶劣后果，揭开了中国赫鲁晓夫推行“工分挂帅”的罪恶阴谋。通过革命大批判，第二生产队学习大寨经营管理方法，开展一心为公的活动的经验，迅速在全大队推广了，一心为公的好社员大量涌现出来。
    听毛主席的话，坚决走大寨道路
    这种与学大寨结合起来的革命大批判，迅速提高了广大贫下中农的阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟。大家对中国赫鲁晓夫越恨，对毛主席越亲；对资产阶级反动路线越仇视，对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线越忠，走大寨道路越坚定。
    红星大队在开展革命大批判的同时，还组织社员活学活用毛主席著作，坚持正面教育，把斗私批修结合起来，肃清中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义黑货在自己头脑中的流毒，树立为革命种田的世界观。
    第一生产队基干民兵石文海，学习了“老三篇”以后，对照自己大开小片荒，不很好到集体地劳动的错误，控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“四大自由”、“三自一包”对他的毒害，从此他上工早，下工迟，干活拣重担子挑，抽空帮军属干活，做了许多一心为公的好事，受到了社员的称赞。广大贫下中农深深体会到：干革命要听毛主席的话，种田要走大寨的道路。
    与学大寨相结合的革命大批判，成了推动生产前进的火车头，毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示得到了落实。全大队出现了群众性的抗旱夏种高潮。
