The propaganda team of the People's Liberation Army's certain unit in Shenyang, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions on "New and old cadres should respect each other, learn from each other, complement each other's strengths, and unite as one to carry out a common cause" and "to ensure that the older generation does not become detached from the masses and that the younger generation gets tempered," has helped the revolutionary committee of Erdaohezi Commune in Changwu County, Liaoning Province, correctly handle the relationship between new and old revolutionary cadres. This has ensured that new and old revolutionary cadres work together as one, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, lead the broad revolutionary masses to launch a fierce attack on the class enemy, and achieve double victories in revolution and production.

The revolutionary committee of Erdaohezi Commune was established in February this year. The new and old cadres who participated in the "three-in-one combination" were tempered and tested in this great proletarian cultural revolution. They are full of enthusiasm for work and have a strong revolutionary spirit, determined to seize power for the proletariat and use it well. However, due to past mistakes in work, the revolutionary leading cadres in the revolutionary committee were not bold enough after participating in the "three-in-one combination." The new cadres, due to lack of experience, had a dependent mindset towards the old cadres. Thus, the new and old cadres could not coordinate well in their work.

The stationed PLA propaganda team believed that enhancing the unity between new and old revolutionary cadres within the revolutionary committee is of great significance for organizing a revolutionary leadership that is connected to the masses. They helped the revolutionary committee hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, organizing new and old cadres to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions on the construction of revolutionary committees. This enabled everyone to deeply understand that only by uniting closely can they resolutely execute and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; only by forming a fist can new and old cadres lead the broad revolutionary masses to launch a powerful struggle against the class enemy.

After studying, the class consciousness of both new and old cadres has greatly improved. They help, support, and learn from each other in their work, and their unity has greatly strengthened. Once, the commune revolutionary committee decided to send the committee chairman, revolutionary leading cadre Mao Guilin, to a brigade where class struggle was relatively complex. Mao Guilin had some hesitation, fearing that he might make mistakes. The militia representative Zhang Bao, who participated in the "three-in-one combination," studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions with him, exposed and denounced the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in advocating the "theory of the extinction of class struggle," and discussed the various manifestations of the class enemy's unwillingness to admit defeat in the cultural revolution. He encouraged Mao Guilin to rely closely on the poor and lower-middle peasants to firmly fight against a handful of class enemies. With everyone's encouragement, Mao Guilin gained confidence, went to this brigade, and mobilized the poor and lower-middle peasants and the masses to launch a fierce attack on the class enemy, achieving double victories in revolution and production, and receiving praise from the poor and lower-middle peasants.

The revolutionary leading cadres participating in the commune revolutionary committee also warmly care about the growth of new cadres. They enthusiastically help new cadres to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in their work and boldly use new cadres. In this commune's revolutionary masses launching a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies, the broad revolutionary masses exposed one by one the remnants of the Kuomintang, including traitors, spies, unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. At the same time, there appeared some phenomena of confusing two different types of contradictions. At this time, the standing committee member and revolutionary leading cadre Gao De actively helped the new cadres in the revolutionary committee to use Chairman Mao's views on class and class analysis to judge who are our enemies and who are our friends, correctly distinguishing between enemy contradictions and contradictions among the people. As a result, the majority of the masses were united, and a handful of class enemies were severely struck, further developing the revolutionary situation.

The PLA propaganda team seriously helped the new and old revolutionary cadres of the commune revolutionary committee to learn from each other humbly. They emphasized that old cadres should learn from new cadres' work style of believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and consulting with the masses on matters; learn from new cadres' revolutionary spirit of daring to think, speak, and act, and their vigorous and decisive work style. New cadres should learn from old cadres' proletarian party spirit of insisting on using Mao Zedong Thought to seize power and strictly implementing the party's policies and guidelines; learn from old cadres' serious, responsible, and down-to-earth work style and their thrifty, hardworking, and laboring people's lifestyle; learn from old cadres' rich experience in class struggle and work.

Now, the new and old cadres participating in this commune's revolutionary committee all have a high sense of responsibility for the proletarian revolutionary cause. They respect and learn from each other, actively engage in ideological struggle, and when they find each other's shortcomings and mistakes, they enthusiastically guide and patiently help. Old cadres boldly take on work and boldly let new cadres experience the wind and rain of class struggle, see the world, and be tempered. New cadres also respect old cadres and actively seek their advice when encountering problems, allowing old cadres to fully play their leading role on the front line of class struggle. The commune leadership is united, and new and old cadres work together as one. Everyone does ideological work, and each person takes on heavy responsibilities. The entire commune's revolution and production are booming. Mao Zedong Thought study classes are blooming everywhere. Poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses from communes, production teams to families and courtyards have set up revolutionary criticism battlefields everywhere, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to launch a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies, making a handful of class enemies sink into the vast ocean of people's war. Now, the new and old revolutionary cadres of the commune revolutionary committee are determined to take Comrade Tan Hengshan, a good cadre who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, as a shining example, to stand guard for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, to fight a good battle, and to build the revolutionary committee into a battle command post that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

    彼此尊重　互相学习　取长补短　团结一致
    革命委员会新老干部紧紧拧成一股绳
    率领广大群众向一小撮阶级敌人猛攻
    二道河子公社领导班子同心协力把革命和生产搞得热气腾腾
    新华社沈阳二十二日电　人民解放军某部毛泽东思想宣传队，遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于“新老干部应该是彼此尊重，互相学习，取长补短，以便团结一致，进行共同的事业”和“使前辈人不脱离群众，使青年人得到锻炼”的伟大教导，帮助辽宁省彰武县二道河子公社革命委员会正确处理新老革命干部的关系，使新老革命干部拧成一股绳，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，率领广大革命群众向阶级敌人发起猛烈进攻，夺取革命和生产的双胜利。
    二道河子公社革命委员会是今年二月份成立的。参加“三结合”的新老干部，在这场无产阶级文化大革命中经受了锻炼和考验，他们工作热情高，革命干劲大，决心为无产阶级掌好权、用好权。但是由于革命委员会中的革命领导干部，过去工作中犯过一些错误，参加革命“三结合”后，工作不够大胆放手。革命委员会中的新干部，因为缺乏经验，工作上对老干部又有依赖思想。这样，新老干部之间，工作上就不能很好协调起来。
    驻社解放军毛泽东思想宣传队认为，增进革委会内新老革命干部的团结，对组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子，具有十分重要的意义。他们就帮助革委会举办毛泽东思想学习班，组织新老干部反复学习毛主席关于革命委员会建设的一系列最新指示。使大家深刻地认识到，只有紧密团结，才能坚决执行和捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线；新老干部只有形成一个拳头，才能率领广大革命群众对阶级敌人进行强有力的战斗。
    经过学习，新老干部的阶级觉悟都有很大提高，在工作中互相帮助，互相支持，互相学习，团结大大增强。一次，公社革委会决定让革委会主任、革命领导干部毛贵林到阶级斗争比较复杂的一个大队去蹲点。毛贵林有些畏难情绪，怕弄不好要犯错误。参加
  “三结合”的民兵代表张宝就和他一起学习毛主席的最新指示，一起揭发、控诉中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭”论的滔天罪行，一起大摆文化大革命运动中阶级敌人不甘心失败的种种表现，并且鼓励他紧紧依靠贫下中农，对一小撮阶级敌人进行坚决的斗争。毛贵林在大家的鼓励下，增强了信心，到这个大队里放手发动贫下中农和社员群众向阶级敌人发起猛攻，夺得了革命和生产的双胜利，受到了贫下中农的赞扬。
    参加公社革命委员会的革命领导干部，也满腔热情地关怀新干部的成长。他们热情帮助新干部活学活用毛泽东思想，在工作上大胆使用新干部。在这个公社的革命群众向一小撮阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻中，广大革命群众把一小撮叛徒、特务、没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子等国民党的残渣余孽一个个挖了出来，同时也出现了一些混淆两类不同性质的矛盾的现象。这时，革委会常委、革命领导干部高德就主动帮助革委会内的新干部，用毛主席关于阶级和阶级分析的观点，来判断谁是我们的敌人，谁是我们的朋友，正确区分敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾，结果团结了绝大多数群众，狠狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人，进一步发展了革命的大好形势。
    解放军毛泽东思想宣传队认真帮助公社革委会的新老革命干部虚心向对方学习。他们强调老干部要学习新干部相信群众、依靠群众、遇事同群众商量的工作作风，学习新干部最少保守思想，敢想、敢说、敢闯的革命精神和朝气蓬勃、雷厉风行的作风。新干部要学习老干部坚持用毛泽东思想掌权，严格执行党的方针政策的无产阶级党性；学习老干部认真负责、踏踏实实的工作作风和艰苦朴素、保持劳动人民本色的生活作风，学习老干部丰富的阶级斗争经验和工作经验。
    现在，参加这个公社革委会的新老干部，都抱着对无产阶级革命事业高度负责的精神，互相尊重，互相学习，积极开展思想斗争，发现对方的缺点错误，就满腔热情地开导，积极耐心地帮助。老干部大胆抓工作，大胆放手地让新干部到阶级斗争中经风雨，见世面，受锻炼。新干部也很尊重老干部，遇到问题就主动向老干部请教，让老干部在阶级斗争的第一线上充分发挥骨干作用。公社领导班子团结一致，新老干部拧成一股绳，人人做思想工作，个个争挑重担，全公社革命和生产都搞得热气腾腾。毛泽东思想学习班遍地开花，贫下中农和革命群众从公社、生产队到家庭、院落到处摆下了革命大批判的战场，以毛泽东思想为武器，向一小撮阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，使一小撮阶级敌人陷入了“人民战争”的汪洋大海之中。现在，公社革委会的新老革命干部，决心以“无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部”门合同志为光辉榜样，为毛主席的无产阶级革命路线放好哨，站好岗，打好仗，把革命委员会建设成为无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的战斗指挥部。
