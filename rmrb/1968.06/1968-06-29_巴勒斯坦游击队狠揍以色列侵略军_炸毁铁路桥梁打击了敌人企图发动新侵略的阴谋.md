Palestinian guerrillas have given a hard blow to the Israeli aggressors by blowing up a railway bridge, thus striking at the enemy's plot to launch a new aggression.

	According to a report by the Syrian newspaper *Revolution*, on June 25, Palestinian guerrillas blew up the main railway bridge near Gaza Airport and the main railway bridge near Han Yunis. They also blew up three other railway bridges in the Gaza Strip. These actions have made it impossible for Israeli trains to run to the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula, thus striking at the Israeli plot to concentrate troops in the Sinai Peninsula and the Suez Canal area to launch a new aggression.

	According to battle reports from "Fatah" (Palestine Liberation Movement) and Syrian newspapers, from June 20 to 24, Palestinian guerrillas launched more than ten attacks in the West Bank of the Jordan River, the Gaza Strip, and areas under Israeli occupation. They killed and wounded more than 150 Israeli aggressors, shot down one helicopter, destroyed one tank, one armored vehicle, nine half-track vehicles, and two factories.

	On June 20, Palestinian guerrillas attacked Israeli aggressors concentrated north of the Dead Sea, killing and wounding 18 Israeli aggressors, destroying one half-track vehicle and one cannon. The guerrillas also attacked Israeli aggressors on the Aluja-Birshiba road, blowing up one half-track vehicle coming to reinforce them, and killing and wounding 15 Israeli aggressors.

	On the night of June 21, the "Storm" commando unit attacked an Israeli factory, destroying the main part of the factory, and blew up a hydraulic engine with landmines near Beit Shafarin. On their way back, they killed one Israeli officer.

	On the morning of June 22, guerrillas attacked Israeli aggressors near Nuwaimah. Enemy helicopters and fighter planes rushed to reinforce them and barbarically dropped napalm bombs. The guerrillas shot down one helicopter, blew up three half-track vehicles, and killed and wounded 35 Israeli aggressors. The same day at noon, a "Storm" commando unit blew up three Israeli officers and seven soldiers in the hall of the Ambassador Hotel in Jerusalem (Arab quarter), wounding five and destroying part of the building. That same evening, Palestinian guerrillas blew up roads near Hakika south of the Dead Sea, roads west of the Dead Sea, and roads in the Ain Bendaka area of Negev, destroying three half-track vehicles and killing and wounding 21 Israeli soldiers.

	On the night of June 23, the "Storm" commando unit attacked Israeli aggressors south of Yussuf village, destroying one tank and one armored vehicle, and killing and wounding 10 Israeli aggressors. Another guerrilla unit ambushed Israeli vehicles near Zara, destroying one half-track vehicle and one military vehicle, and killing and wounding 28 Israeli aggressors.

	On the night of June 24, the "Storm" commando unit attacked the Israeli phosphate factory in the southwest of the Arab Valley in Negev, destroying important parts of the factory. Israeli reinforcements rushed to surround the commando unit but failed.
