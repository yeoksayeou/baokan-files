The Soviet revisionist clique's vigorous promotion of policies such as "material incentives" and "profit-oriented management" has led to widespread embezzlement, speculation, and profiteering in many enterprises, with large amounts of funds and goods ending up in private pockets under the direct involvement and connivance of managers.

Stealing State Property Becomes Commonplace

According to the Soviet revisionist newspaper *Communist*, due to the chaotic financial discipline in enterprises, there are many instances of "arbitrary waste and embezzlement of state property." The newspaper cites the example of the Armenian Republic's Gas Construction Trust, stating that embezzlement of public funds has been severe in the enterprises under this trust for many years. During the tenure of a manager named Matoyan, the trust was embezzled of tens of millions of rubles. However, Matoyan not only went unpunished but was also reassigned to a leadership position after leaving the trust: he became the manager of the Armenian Republic's Construction Department's Housing Construction Combine. The newspaper also revealed that employees of the First Specialized Sanitation Vehicle Company in the Yerevan-Spartak District of the republic, in collusion with some employees of the Yerevan City Committee's Public Utilities Management Bureau, embezzled more than ten million rubles over two and a half years.

*The Communist* newspaper further admits that "during the shipment and receipt of goods, there are often shortages of products and commodities," and many products are embezzled by employees of the shipping or receiving parties.

"The Director" Publicly Extorts Money

The director of the Azerbaijan Republic's Grain Products Administration, Guseynov, became accustomed to accepting bribes and eventually began openly extorting money. He frequently demanded "rewards" from subordinates who were promoted, sent on lucrative business trips, or assigned profitable tasks. Once, when Guseynov went on a business trip to Moscow, he demanded 1,000 rubles in "travel expenses" from the manager of the Baku Sales Office. Another time, Guseynov extorted 800 rubles from the director of a construction management bureau under his jurisdiction.

Stores Lack Goods, Black Market Thrives

In a store in Leningrad that specializes in selling hardware, electrical wires, and various small parts, goods are often "out of stock." However, as soon as customers express their disappointment, speculators appear with all sorts of items, from hardware and electrical wires to plastic sheets, and even scarce television tuner transformers. In short, from speculators, one can buy cars, motorcycles, bicycles, and various parts and miscellaneous items that photography and radio enthusiasts dream of.

Farm Leaders Seize Land

The leaders of the "State Farm" named after Dzhanganov in the Kuba District of the Azerbaijan Republic have, in recent years, occupied over a hundred plots of orchard land to build private residences. Fruit cultivation is the main economic department of the Dzhanganov State Farm. Due to the arbitrary seizure of the farm's public land, there are now 140 hectares of private orchards in this farm. The orchard land next to the residence of the brigade leader Gaydarov has now expanded to four times the original standard. The brigade leader Mamadov, using his authority, seized a "large piece of land" from the farm in the name of his son. The farm manager Musaev, brigade leaders Kremov, and Gajiyev all used this method to seize a considerable amount of the farm's land.

They also embezzled the farm's property, privately dividing and selling the fruits produced in the farm's orchards. In 1966, the brigade leaders of this farm each harvested an average of 100 to 150 centners of fruit per hectare in their private orchards next to their residences, while the farm's orchards yielded only 6 to 7 centners per hectare. The reason for the low yield in the farm's orchards, aside from poor management, is also because the fruits were privately divided and sold while still on the trees by this privileged class.

    资本主义的“瘟疫”在苏联流行泛滥
    贪污盗窃、投机倒把成风　大量资金和产品进了私人腰包
    本报讯　苏修叛徒集团大力推行“物质刺激”、“利润挂帅”等一系列资本主义经营管理方针的结果，许多企业的工作人员在负责人的直接参与和纵容下，贪污盗窃、投机倒把成风，把大量资金和产品塞进私人腰包。
    盗窃资财成风
    据苏修亚美尼亚共和国《共产党人》报供认，由于企业的财政纪律混乱，有许多“随意浪费和贪污国家财产的现象”。报纸举亚美尼亚瓦斯建设托拉斯为例说，这个托拉斯所属企业，多年来贪污盗窃公款的现象十分严重。在一个名叫马托扬的担任经理期间，托拉斯被盗窃公款达几十万卢布之多。但是，马托扬不但逍遥法外，而且在离开托拉斯后再一次被安置到领导岗位上：他又担任亚美尼亚共和国建筑部房屋建筑联合公司的经理去了。报纸还透露，这个共和国埃里温斯潘达梁斯克区第一专业化清洁卫生汽车公司的工作人员，勾结埃里温市委执委公用事业管理局的一些工作人员，在两年半的时间中，盗窃资金十万卢布以上。
    《共产党人》报还供认说，各企业“在发货和收货时，产品和商品不够数是大量的”，而许多产品是被发货方或收货方的工作人员侵吞了。
    “局长”公开勒索
    阿塞拜疆共和国谷物产品总管理局局长古谢诺夫，受贿成了习惯，后来干脆公开勒索。他经常向被提拔职务的、担任“有油水的”出差的以及接受有利可图的任务的下属工作人员，张口索取“酬谢”。一次，古谢诺夫去莫斯科出差，就向巴库销售站经理要了一千卢布的“路费”。另一次，古谢诺夫又从属于他管辖的建筑管理局局长那里索取了八百卢布。商店缺货，黑市兴隆
    在列宁格勒一个专门出售五金制品、电线和各种小零件的商店里，经常“缺货”。但当顾客表示失望的时候，专门搞投机倒把活动的人立刻就出现了。他们手里有各种东西，五金制品、电线、塑料板等自不必说，而且还有市场上奇缺的电视机用的谐调变压器。总之，从投机分子手里可以买到汽车、摩托车、自行车以及摄影、无线电爱好者们所梦寐以求的各种各样的零件和零星物品。
    农场干部侵占土地
    阿塞拜疆共和国库巴区日丹诺夫“国营农场”的领导人近年来占用了一百多块果园用地，建筑私人住宅。果木业是日丹诺夫农场的主要经济部门。由于任意侵占农场公有土地，目前，在这个农场，私人果园面积已扩大到一百四十公顷。生产队长盖达罗夫的宅旁园地面积，现在已比原定标准扩大了四倍。生产队长玛麦多夫凭借他的权力用他儿子的名义把农场的“一大块地”据为己有。这个农场管理处主任穆萨耶夫、生产队长克里莫夫、加及耶夫等领导人员都用这种办法，侵占了农场的不少土地。
    他们还贪污农场财产，私自偷分和出卖农场果园出产的水果。一九六六年，这个农场的各生产队长在自家的宅旁园地上平均每公顷收获了一百至一百五十公担水果，而农场果园每公顷平均只收了六至七公担水果。农场果园的收获量之所以这样低，除了由于经营管理很差以外，也由于农场的水果还在树上就被这一伙特权阶层私分卖掉了。
