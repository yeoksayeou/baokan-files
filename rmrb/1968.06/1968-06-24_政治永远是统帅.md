Title: Politics is Always the Commander

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work," "Without a correct political standpoint, it is as if one has no soul." Yet, China's Khrushchev has consistently opposed emphasizing proletarian politics and political command, vigorously advocating material incentives to poison people's minds. He arrogantly shouts: "In recent years, some places have emphasized political command too much, denying material interests, and the result is that political command has exhausted material interests." He falsely claims that "material incentives" can "boost the masses' enthusiasm" and "benefit production," and so on. This is a complete exposure of China's Khrushchev's bourgeois worldview, and it is also a malicious slander against our working people.

Is it proletarian political command or material incentives, "money as the commander"? These are two fundamentally opposed political lines. We emphasize proletarian politics and insist on Mao Zedong Thought as the commander, based on the laws of development of socialist society, adapting to the economic foundation of socialist society, and based on the objective fact that class struggle still exists in socialist society. Politics is the commander, the soul. To enhance socialist enthusiasm, one must emphasize proletarian politics and Mao Zedong Thought as the commander. When a person's political outlook changes, spiritual power will turn into a powerful material force. Comrade Lin Biao said well: "If political work is done well, people's enthusiasm and creativity will be unleashed, and all work will be done well. Starting from this link, everything will be smooth." But the "enthusiasm" raised by material incentives is only the bourgeois individualism of pursuing good food, clothing, housing, and entertainment. Didn't China's Khrushchev shout, "Whoever wears the most beautiful clothes and wears the most gemstones, that shows whose labor is good"? The "enthusiasm" he wants to boost is the bourgeois individualism of "wearing the most beautiful clothes" and "wearing gemstones." Countless facts prove that material incentives do not inspire people to work for the revolution but lure them to fight for money. This will allow bourgeois ideology to spread and make socialism peacefully evolve into capitalism.

Following Chairman Mao's teachings, our party and state have always been very attentive to improving the people's lives as production develops, and this improvement is based on the long-term and fundamental interests of the proletariat. Everything is done "starting from the fact that our country has six hundred million people" and "subordinating personal interests to the interests of the nation and the people." Only this kind of improvement is a true improvement in the people's lives, and only this kind of concern is a true concern for the people's lives. But the "material interests" advocated by China's Khrushchev, stripped of their disguise, are using small favors to buy hearts, using the bourgeois worldview of "dying for money, birds for food" to corrupt people's souls, making the working class obedient tools; using money as a shackle, pulling the workers' necks to follow him down the capitalist road.

China's Khrushchev is so desperate to advocate material incentives, ultimately aiming to use the counter-revolutionary means of peaceful evolution to restore capitalism in China and overthrow proletarian dictatorship. The Soviet Khrushchev shouted that the "principle of material interests is the principle of building communism," and the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the party also openly shouted to "rely on material incentives to advance towards communism." Look! How alike they are! Their communism, in essence, is capitalism. The Soviet revisionist leadership clique vigorously promoted the "principle of material interests" and other series of measures to restore capitalism in the Soviet Union, making the first great socialist country step by step completely slide onto the capitalist road. The lessons of the past should be heeded. If we allow the fallacy of "material incentives" to spread, allowing China's Khrushchev's plot to succeed, then our country will inevitably face a nationwide counter-revolutionary restoration. Now, what is obtained are a few banknotes, but in the future, the entire socialist homeland will be lost.

We, the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses, must take Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois ideology of pursuing personal fame and gain, and wholeheartedly serve the people; always remember class struggle, always remember proletarian dictatorship, always remember emphasizing politics, and always remember holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Only in this way can we eliminate the conditions for the production of revisionism, truly uproot revisionism, and ensure that our socialist homeland remains unchanged for generations to come.

    政治永远是统帅
    青卫东
    毛主席教导我们说：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”，“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”而中国赫鲁晓夫一贯地反对突出无产阶级政治，反对政治挂帅，极力鼓吹物质刺激来毒害人们的意识。他狂妄地叫嚣：“几年来有些地方只强调政治挂帅，否定物质利益，结果政治挂帅把物质利益挂光了。”他胡说“物质刺激”能“提高群众的积极性”，“有利于生产”，等等。这是中国赫鲁晓夫资产阶级世界观的大暴露，也是对我们劳动人民的恶毒的诬蔑。
    是无产阶级政治挂帅，还是物质刺激、“金钱挂帅”，这是两条根本对立的政治路线。我们突出无产阶级政治，坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，是根据社会主义社会的发展规律，适应社会主义社会的经济基础提出来的，是根据社会主义社会还存在着阶级和阶级斗争的客观事实提出来的。政治是统帅，是灵魂。提高社会主义积极性，只能靠突出无产阶级政治，靠毛泽东思想挂帅。人的政治思想面貌改变了，精神力量就会变成强大的物质力量。林彪同志说得好：“政治工作做好了，人的积极性、创造性发挥起来了，各种工作就都能做好。从这一环着手，一通百通。”而用物质刺激所提高起来的“积极性”，只能是追求吃好穿好住好玩好的资产阶级利己主义“积极性”。中国赫鲁晓夫不是早就叫嚷“谁穿的最漂亮，谁戴的宝石戒指，这就说明谁的劳动好”吗？他所要提高的就是这种“穿的最漂亮”和“戴宝石戒指”的资产阶级个人主义积极性。无数事实证明，物质刺激不是鼓舞人们为革命而劳动，而是引诱人们为钞票而斗争。这样就会使资产阶级思想泛滥起来，使社会主义和平演变为资本主义。
    遵照毛主席的教导，我们党和国家从来都是十分注意随着生产的发展而不断改善人民生活的，而这种改善又是以无产阶级的长远利益和根本利益为前提的，一切“从我国有六亿人口这一点出发”，“以个人利益服从于民族的和人民群众的利益”。只有这种改善才是人民生活真正的改善，只有这种关心才是对人民生活真正的关心。而中国赫鲁晓夫所鼓吹的“物质利益”，剥开画皮，就是用小恩小惠收买人心，就是要用“人为财死，鸟为食亡”的资产阶级世界观来腐蚀人们的灵魂，让工人群众服服贴贴地做他的驯服工具；就是用金钱做枷锁，拉着工人的脖子跟他走资本主义道路。
    中国赫鲁晓夫如此拚命地鼓吹物质刺激，归根到底，就是妄图用和平演变的反革命手段，在中国复辟资本主义，颠覆无产阶级专政。苏联的赫鲁晓夫叫嚷“物质利益原则是共产主义的建设原则”，党内另一个最大的走资本主义道路当权派也公开叫嚣要“靠物质刺激走向共产主义”。看！他们是多么志同道合啊！他们的共产主义，说穿了，就是资本主义。苏修领导集团在苏联大肆推行“物质利益原则”和其他一系列的复辟资本主义的措施，使第一个伟大的社会主义国家一步一步地全面滑到资本主义道路上去了。前车之覆，应为鉴戒。如果我们听任“物质刺激”的谬论泛滥下去，使中国赫鲁晓夫的阴谋得逞，那么我们的国家也就不可避免地要出现全国性的反革命复辟，现在拿到的是几张钞票，将来丢掉的却是整个社会主义江山。
    我们亿万革命群众，一定要以毛泽东思想为武器，要大破追求个人名利的资产阶级思想，全心全意地为人民服务；要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。只有这样，才能杜绝修正主义产生的条件，真正挖掉修正主义的根子，保证我国社会主义江山千秋万代永不变色。
