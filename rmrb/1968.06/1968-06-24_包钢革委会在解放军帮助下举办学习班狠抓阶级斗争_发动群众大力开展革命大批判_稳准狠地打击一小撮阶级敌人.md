The PLA support-left detachment stationed at the Baotou Iron and Steel Company, following Chairman Mao's directive that "holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes," has helped the newly established Revolutionary Committee to hold extensive study classes centered on class struggle. In these classes, members of the Revolutionary Committee, leaders of mass organizations, and revolutionary workers have studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, carried out thorough revolutionary criticism, and launched a fierce offensive against a small handful of class enemies, turning the study classes into battlefields against the enemy and classrooms for self-education.

After achieving decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, some comrades in Baogang developed the idea of "peacefully carrying out the revolution and steadily engaging in production." In response to this complacent and arrogant thinking, everyone in the study classes repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the broad revolutionary masses led by it against the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Through analyzing the enemy situation and listing numerous facts of how a small handful of class enemies attempted to dismantle the Revolutionary Committee, everyone recognized that a small handful of unrepentant capitalist-roaders, traitors, spies, counter-revolutionaries, and remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries will never accept defeat. They always look for opportunities to attempt a comeback. Our struggle against them is a continuation of the long-term struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries and the class struggle against the bourgeoisie, a life-and-death struggle between restoration and anti-restoration. While criticizing the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" of China's Khrushchev, many comrades also voluntarily examined their own complacent and arrogant thinking. Some members of the Revolutionary Committee deeply felt that if the Revolutionary Committee relaxed its class struggle, it would be the greatest disloyalty to Chairman Mao. The work of the Revolutionary Committee is complex, but by grasping the active application of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and grasping class struggle, we grasp the essence. Revolutionary workers and cadres participating in the study classes armed themselves with Chairman Mao's latest instructions and expressed their determination to take the initiative to launch an offensive against class enemies and smash all of the enemy's restoration plots and tricks. In a relatively short period, they exposed a batch of traitors, spies, stubborn capitalist-roaders, and other counter-revolutionaries who had been hiding for a long time and digging deep.

In the process of exposing and fighting against class enemies, the students in the study classes carried out a vigorous revolutionary criticism. Everyone combined the reactionary points of China's Khrushchev and a small handful of the biggest capitalist-roaders within the party with the crimes of capitalist-roaders, traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries in their own units for criticism, becoming more and more hateful towards the bourgeois reactionary line. Because of the close combination of extensive exposure, extensive criticism, and extensive struggle, the entire company presented a vigorous revolutionary scene. Revolutionary masses said, if the class enemy wants to reverse the verdict, we will, through revolutionary criticism, make the class enemy's case irreversible, so that they can never reverse it. A stubborn capitalist-roader, after being exposed, was still very arrogant and openly opposed the revolutionary masses. When his crimes were linked with China's Khrushchev's reactionary statements, analyzed point by point, and subjected to revolutionary criticism, he had to admit his guilt. Some study classes also invited family members to participate in the criticism meetings and posted exposure and criticism big-character posters in the family areas, making this small handful of class enemies into rats that everyone wants to beat.

With the help of the support-left personnel, the Revolutionary Committee often organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's and Vice Chairman Lin's teachings on criticizing revisionism and combating selfishness, guiding everyone to combine criticizing revisionism with combating selfishness, and further promoting their own thought revolutionization. Some who had made mistakes corrected their mistakes through criticizing revisionism and combating selfishness. A leader of a mass organization was deceived by a capitalist-roader in his unit and was silent and reticent after coming to the study class, fearing that criticizing that capitalist-roader would implicate himself. However, with the patient help of the revolutionary masses and through the mass activity of criticizing revisionism and combating selfishness, he finally had a revolutionary explosion in his soul, exposing a large number of crimes committed by that capitalist-roader. He excitedly said, Chairman Mao's latest instructions saved me, making me change my stance, and comrades, following Chairman Mao's teachings, enthusiastically helped me, promoting me to join the revolution. Some units, after a period of revolutionary criticism, organized a meeting to share experiences in criticizing revisionism and combating selfishness, achieving good results. Through criticizing revisionism and combating selfishness, the broad revolutionary masses further raised their awareness of the two-line struggle, loved the great leader Chairman Mao even more, and hated China's Khrushchev and all class enemies even more.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the broad revolutionary people of Baotou Iron and Steel Company, in the sharp and fierce revolutionary struggle, correctly distinguished between the two types of contradictions, isolated the enemy, and strengthened themselves, further promoting the great unity of the broad revolutionary masses on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, effectively consolidating and developing the revolutionary three-in-one combination and revolutionary great alliance. Some units that originally had two factions became more united after exposing and criticizing the class enemies. Revolutionary masses said, we have united as one, no matter how deep the class enemy hides or where they hide, we can dig them out. Broad cadres were tested again in the struggle against the enemy. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, cadres who had made mistakes actively exposed and criticized the crimes of class enemies together with the broad masses. Many of them, because of their new merits in the struggle against the enemy, were forgiven by the broad masses and re-joined the revolutionary ranks, strongly consolidating and developing the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

    包钢革委会在解放军帮助下举办学习班狠抓阶级斗争
    发动群众大力开展革命大批判
    稳准狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人
    据新华社呼和浩特二十三日电　人民解放军驻包头钢铁公司支左部队，遵照毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的教导，帮助新生的革命委员会大办以阶级斗争为中心内容的毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里，革委会成员、群众组织的领导成员和广大革命职工，大学毛主席的最新指示，深入开展革命大批判，向一小撮阶级敌人主动发起猛烈进攻，使学习班变成了打击敌人的战场，教育自己的课堂。
    包钢的无产阶级文化大革命在取得决定性胜利之后，有的同志产生了“太太平平干革命，稳稳当当搞生产”的思想。针对这种轻敌麻痹思想，在学习班里，大家逐字逐句地反复学习毛主席的最新指示：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”大家经过分析敌情，列举了一小撮阶级敌人妄图搞垮革委会等大量活生生的事实，认识到一小撮死不悔改的走资派和叛徒、特务、反革命分子等国民党反动派的残渣余孽，是决不会甘心失败的，他们总是寻找机会妄图复辟，我们跟他们的斗争，就是同国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，同资产阶级阶级斗争的继续，就是复辟反复辟的生死搏斗。不少同志在批判中国赫鲁晓夫“阶级斗争熄灭”论的同时，自动检查了自己的轻敌麻痹思想。革委会有些成员深有感慨地说，革委会如果放松了阶级斗争，就是对毛主席的最大不忠。革委会工作千头万绪，抓住了活学活用毛主席一系列最新指示，抓住了阶级斗争，才是抓住了根本。参加学习班的革命职工和干部，用毛主席的最新指示武装自己，纷纷表示决心主动地向阶级敌人展开进攻，粉碎敌人的一切复辟阴谋诡计。他们在不太长的时间内，就挖出了一批藏了很久钻得很深的叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派和其他反革命分子。
    在对阶级敌人揭发斗争的过程中，学习班学员开展了轰轰烈烈的革命大批判。大家把中国赫鲁晓夫等一小撮党内最大走资派的反动论点同本单位走资派、叛徒、特务、反革命分子的罪行结合起来进行批判，越批对资产阶级反动路线越仇恨。由于大揭发、大批判、大斗争紧密结合，全公司出现了轰轰烈烈的革命景象。广大革命群众说，阶级敌人要翻案，我们就要通过革命大批判，把阶级敌人的案给定得死死的，叫他永世不得翻身。有一个顽固不化的走资派，被揪出来后气焰仍然非常嚣张，公开同革命群众相对抗。当把他的罪行同中国赫鲁晓夫的反动言论挂上线，逐条加以解剖，展开革命大批判后，他不得不低头认罪。有的学习班，还把家属请来参加批判大会，把揭发批判的大字报贴到家属区，使这一小撮阶级敌人成了过街老鼠，人人喊打。
    革委会在支左人员的帮助下，在革命大批判中经常组织大家学习毛主席、林副主席关于斗私批修的教导，引导大家把斗私批修结合起来，进一步促进自己的思想革命化。有些犯了错误的人，通过斗私批修也坚决地改正自己的错误。有一个群众组织的头头，受了本单位走资派的蒙蔽，来学习班后就沉默寡言，怕批判了那个走资派牵连了自己。但是在革命群众的耐心帮助下，在群众性的斗私批修活动中，他终于在灵魂深处爆发了革命，揭发了这个走资派的大量罪行。他激动地说，毛主席的最新指示挽救了我，使我改变了立场，同志们按照毛主席的教导，热情帮助我，促使我起来革命了。有些单位进行一段革命大批判后，就组织一次斗私批修讲用会，收到了很好的效果。广大革命群众通过斗私批修，进一步提高了两条路线斗争的觉悟，对伟大领袖毛主席更加热爱，对中国赫鲁晓夫和一切阶级敌人更加仇恨。
    包头钢铁公司广大革命人民群众在毛主席最新指示的指引下，在尖锐、激烈的革命斗争中，由于正确区分两类不同性质的矛盾，孤立了敌人，壮大了自己，在毛泽东思想基础上，进一步促进了广大革命群众的大团结，有效地巩固和发展了革命大联合和革命的三结合。一些原来有两派组织的单位，经过对阶级敌人的揭发批判斗争，两派革命群众更亲密了。广大革命群众说，咱们扭成了一股劲，无论阶级敌人隐藏多深，隐藏在哪儿，都能把他们挖出来。广大干部在对敌斗争中又一次经受了考验。在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，犯有错误的干部同广大群众一起积极揭发、批判阶级敌人的罪行。他们之中的不少人由于在对敌斗争中立了新功，得到广大群众的谅解，重新参加了革命行列，有力地巩固和发展了革命的三结合。
