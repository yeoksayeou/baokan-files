New Zealand workers, students, and sailors have been holding large-scale strikes and protests in recent days to oppose U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam, to oppose the establishment of U.S. military bases in New Zealand, to oppose price increases, and to demand wage increases.

In Wellington, approximately six thousand workers, students, and other citizens held a large-scale demonstration in front of the Parliament building on June 26. The originally scheduled parliamentary opening ceremony was forced to be canceled due to the public demonstration. That day at noon, thousands of striking workers rushed to the Parliament building. They held up many signs condemning the U.S. and New Zealand for invading Vietnam, with some reading, "Do not let the New Zealand people starve, do not slaughter the Vietnamese people!"

When the workers' demonstration reached the Parliament Square, they merged with thousands of anti-U.S. Vietnam War protesters. More than a thousand student demonstrators also arrived. The students held up red flags and shouted slogans such as, "Workers and students unite!" "Holyoake (New Zealand Prime Minister) get out!" "Increase scholarships and wages!" They also shouted slogans against the establishment of U.S. military bases in New Zealand. Many Maori people also traveled from hundreds of miles away to participate in the demonstration.

The ruling authorities, frightened by the demonstrators, dispatched a large number of police to use ropes and barricades to block the square, attempting to prevent the demonstrators from entering. However, the demonstrators crossed the barricades, surrounded the entire Parliament steps, and forced the British Governor-General and diplomatic envoys to sneak into the Parliament building through the back door. The police brutally used force to try to disperse the demonstrators. The enraged workers and students fought back bravely, holding their ground and sending the police's helmets flying.

The demonstrators also ignored the sabotage by right-wing union leaders and continued their struggle. When the right-wing union leaders shouted that wage demands must be negotiated through the courts, the demonstrators laughed at them and interrupted their speeches, shouting slogans such as, "Change the system!" When the right-wing union leaders came out one by one to demand that the demonstrators disperse, the demonstrators firmly refused to move. At this point, the ruling authorities also brought in part of the military, which had been acting as an honor guard, to suppress the demonstrators along with the police. The demonstrators engaged in fierce struggles with the military and police.

The morning and evening newspapers in Wellington were unable to be published that day due to the participation of staff in the demonstration.

In Christchurch, one thousand students held a demonstration in the main square on the evening of June 25, opposing the U.S. plan to establish a military base in New Zealand. Earlier, about five hundred students held up signs opposing U.S. aggression against Vietnam and opposing the establishment of a navigation system for U.S. submarines equipped with Polaris missiles, surrounding the headquarters of the U.S. Navy Antarctic Support Force in Christchurch. When one student was arrested, several hundred other students surrounded the police car holding the student until he was released.

All sailors in New Zealand held a 24-hour strike on June 26 to protest the shipping company's refusal to adopt new safety measures for the crew.

Forestry workers in Kaingaroa and Kinleith also held strikes and demonstrations on the same day, demanding wage increases.

    不许美帝屠杀越南人民　不许在新西兰建立美军基地
    新西兰工人学生连日示威英勇战斗
    惠灵顿六千群众示威，击退警察进攻，粉碎工贼破坏，迫使议会取消原定开幕式
    新华社奥克兰二十七日电　新西兰的工人、学生和海员连日来举行大规模的罢工和抗议示威，反对美帝国主义侵略越南，反对美国在新西兰建立军事基地，反对物价上涨，要求增加工资。
    在惠灵顿，约六千名工人、学生和其他群众二十六日在议会大厦前举行大规模的示威。原定在当天举行的议会开幕式由于群众示威而被迫取消。这天中午，数以千计的罢工工人纷纷赶到议会大厦前，他们举着许多谴责美国和新西兰侵略越南的标语牌，有的上面写着：“不许让新西兰人民挨饿，不许屠杀越南人民！”
    当工人的示威队伍到达议会广场时，同数以百计的反对美国侵越战争的示威者汇合，一千多名示威学生也随后赶到。学生们举着红旗，高呼“工人和学生联合起来！”“霍利约克（新西兰总理）滚蛋！”“必须增加助学金和工资！”他们还高呼反对美国在新西兰建立军事基地等口号。许多毛利族人也从数百英里外的地方赶来参加了示威游行。
    被示威群众吓破了胆的统治当局派出大批警察用绳子和路障把广场地圈了起来，企图阻止示威群众进入广场。但是，示威者越过路障，围住了整个议会台阶，迫使英国总督和外交使节只得从议会大厦的后门偷偷地溜进去。警察残酷使用暴力，企图驱散示威者。愤怒的工人和学生进行了英勇还击，坚守阵地，把警察的钢盔弄得满天飞。
    示威群众还不顾工会右翼头目的破坏，坚持进行斗争。当工会右翼头目叫嚷必须通过法庭来谈判工资要求的时候，示威工人对他们发出讥笑声，并打断他们的话，高呼“要改变制度！”等口号。当工会右翼头目一个个出来要求示威群众散开时，示威群众坚决拒绝移动。这时，统治当局把一部分本来充当仪仗队的军队也调来，同警察一起镇压示威群众，示威者同军警展开了激烈的搏斗。
    惠灵顿当天的晨报和晚报，由于工作人员参加示威游行而无法出版。
    在克赖斯特彻奇市，一千名学生二十五日晚上在主要广场上举行示威，反对美国在新西兰策划建立军事基地。在这之前，大约五百名学生举着反对美国侵略越南、反对为装备有北极星导弹的美国潜水艇建立导航系统等标语牌，包围了美国海军南极支援部队克赖斯特彻奇总部。当一名学生被捕时，其他几百名学生便围起关着这个学生的囚车，直到这个学生被释放为止。
    全新西兰的海员二十六日举行了二十四小时罢工，抗议航运公司拒绝为船员采取新的安全措施。
    凯因加罗阿和金来斯的林业工人同一天也举行罢工和示威游行，要求增加工资。
