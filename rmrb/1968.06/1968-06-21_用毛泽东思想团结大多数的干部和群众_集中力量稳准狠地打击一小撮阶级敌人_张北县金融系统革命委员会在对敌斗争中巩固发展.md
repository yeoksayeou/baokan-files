The revolutionary committee of the financial system in Zhangbei County, Hebei Province, with the strong support of the PLA's leftist cadre, has followed Chairman Mao's instructions to strictly distinguish between two types of contradictions. They have used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to unite the vast majority of cadres and the masses, forming a mighty revolutionary army. They have steadily, accurately, and fiercely struck a small clique of class enemies, further consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and developing a good situation.

Clearing Away Ideological Obstacles in the Struggle Against Enemies

After the establishment of the revolutionary committee of the financial system in Zhangbei County, they actively led the broad revolutionary cadres and masses to launch an attack on the class enemies. A small clique of class enemies, feeling their doom approaching, viciously slandered the revolutionary committee as "uniting the bad and striking the good," attempting to muddy the waters to escape their deserved punishment. At that time, some comrades in the revolutionary faction hesitated, some members of the revolutionary committee were a bit hesitant, and some cadres who had executed the bourgeois reactionary line were also full of worries. All of this seriously hindered the further development of the struggle against enemies.

To help the members of the revolutionary committee and the broad cadres and masses raise their ideological awareness, expose the tricks and deceits of the class enemies, and strengthen the dictatorship of the masses over the class enemies, the PLA's leftist cadre first studied with the members of the revolutionary committee Chairman Mao's instructions: "Without mobilizing the masses and without the supervision of the masses, it is impossible to effectively exercise dictatorship over reactionaries and bad elements, nor is it possible to effectively reform them. They will continue to make trouble and have the possibility of a comeback."

The members of the revolutionary committee also conducted research and analysis in conjunction with the situation in their unit. They realized that every victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In any situation, as long as the masses are mobilized and relied upon, the revolution will be victorious; if the masses are alienated and even suppressed, the revolution will inevitably fail. Therefore, the class enemies must be fought with a "people's war."

Next, the leftist cadre and the members of the revolutionary committee armed the cadres and the masses with Chairman Mao's relevant instructions and the party's series of policies, making them distinguish between the fundamental differences between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the bourgeois reactionary line: the bourgeois reactionary line directs its spearhead at the masses, while the dictatorship of the proletariat directs its spearhead at a small clique of class enemies. At the same time, they made everyone understand that for those who have made mistakes but are not stubbornly unrepentant, the party has always implemented Chairman Mao's policy of "punishing the past to educate the future and curing the sickness to save the patient," rather than beating them to death with one stick.

The PLA's leftist cadre also organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's series of instructions on class struggle, linking them with the actual class struggle in their unit, thoroughly exposing the tricks and deceits of the class enemies and revealing their counter-revolutionary faces. In this way, everyone removed their ideological worries and marched forward lightly, united against the enemy.

Uniting the Majority of Cadres Around the Revolutionary Committee

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of the revolution." The members of the revolutionary committee understood from this instruction of Chairman Mao that only by using the method of class analysis and strictly distinguishing between two types of contradictions, can we firmly unite true friends and steadily, accurately, and fiercely strike the class enemies. They believed that revolutionary cadres have rich experience in class struggle and work ability, and can play an important role in the struggle against enemies. Therefore, following Chairman Mao's cadre policy, uniting the vast majority of cadres is an important link in attacking a small clique of class enemies. Thus, the members of the revolutionary committee and the leftist cadre, with Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, first conducted a serious and specific analysis of the cadres in their unit.

The small clique of capitalists within the Zhangbei County financial system had once frantically pushed the "strike a large area, protect a small clique" bourgeois reactionary line of Chinese Khrushchev, using cadres as the target of attack, making the majority of cadres stand aside. Many of these cadres came from poor families, and some had begged for food and worked as laborers in the old society. They had deep hatred for the Kuomintang reactionaries and deep proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao. Some people, although they had made this or that mistake, were revolutionary and were determined to walk the socialist road, faithfully serving the proletariat and the working people. Some people, although they had some general historical problems, had a strict distinction from traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries. Some people, although they had once executed the bourgeois reactionary line in the early days of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, were also victims and had fundamental differences with the capitalist roaders. Through criticism and education, they could completely wake up.

In the process of analysis, they strictly drew the line between cadres who had executed the bourgeois reactionary line and the capitalist roaders, and between cadres with general historical problems and traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries. Through such meticulous work, everyone unanimously recognized that in the cadre team, the number of bad people mixed in is extremely small, and the problems of the vast majority of cadres belong to contradictions within the people.

The revolutionary committee, following Chairman Mao's instructions on cadre issues, adopted the method of "unity—criticism and self-criticism—unity," enthusiastically helping cadres to consciously revolutionize. For those who could be liberated, they resolutely liberated them; for those who had already been liberated, they tightly united them around the revolutionary committee, fully playing their role in the struggle against enemies. Many cadres excitedly expressed: They would not let down the great leader Chairman Mao's care and expectations and would definitely make achievements and make amends in the struggle against enemies.

Mobilizing the Majority of the Masses as the Main Force

To unite the vast majority of the masses to jointly fight against the enemy, the members of the revolutionary committee and the leftist cadre studied together Chairman Mao's instruction: "We must firmly believe that the majority of the masses are good, and the bad people are extremely few." Linking it with the actual situation in their unit, they further realized that the broad revolutionary masses have the deepest feelings for Chairman Mao and the greatest love for socialism; they have a clear love and hate. As for those who said or did the wrong things, the majority belong to the issue of awareness, being temporarily deceived by the class enemies, and can completely wake up through criticism and education. The revolutionary committee strictly drew the line between the deceived masses and the extremely few bad leaders, and between the masses who said or did the wrong things or stood on the wrong side and those who persistently held a reactionary stance.

In a local bank, there was a security guard who, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, was manipulated by class enemies to do some bad things. In the struggle against enemies, some people advocated pulling him to a struggle meeting. Should he be struggled against or not? The revolutionary committee guided everyone to conduct a class analysis of this comrade's situation: he came from a poor peasant family, worked as a shepherd for the landlord since he was young, joined the revolution in 1945, joined the Communist Party of China in 1946, and his performance in various political movements was relatively active. It was just that he neglected ideological remolding, and the "self" in his mind expanded, being used by the class enemies. Everyone thought that this comrade who made mistakes was different in nature from those who persistently held a reactionary stance. He should be united and educated. Because uniting one more deceived mass means adding one more revolutionary force. Thus, everyone, following Chairman Mao's instruction of "punishing the past to educate the future and curing the sickness to save the patient," through serious criticism and education, enthusiastically helped him to recognize and correct his mistakes, quickly returning to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The revolutionary committee of the financial system in Zhangbei County, by strictly distinguishing between enemies and ourselves and correctly handling two types of contradictions, united all revolutionary forces and allies that could be united, to the greatest extent isolated a small clique of class enemies, making the revolutionary committee increasingly consolidated and developed in the struggle against the class enemies.

    用毛泽东思想团结大多数的干部和群众
    集中力量稳准狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人
    张北县金融系统革命委员会在对敌斗争中巩固发展
    本报讯　河北省张北县金融系统革命委员会，在解放军支左人员大力帮助下，遵照毛主席的教导，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想团结绝大多数干部和群众，组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，稳准狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，进一步巩固了无产阶级专政，发展了大好形势。
    扫清对敌斗争中的思想障碍
    张北县金融系统革命委员会成立以后，主动带领广大革命干部和革命群众向阶级敌人发起进攻。一小撮阶级敌人感到末日临头，恶毒地诽谤革委会“团结了坏人，打击了好人”，妄图把水搅浑，以逃脱应受的惩罚。当时，无产阶级革命派的一些同志犹豫起来，革委会的个别成员也有点缩手缩脚，一些执行过资产阶级反动路线的干部更是顾虑重重。所有这些，严重地阻碍了对敌斗争的进一步开展。
    为了帮助革委会成员和广大干部群众提高思想认识，识破阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，加强对阶级敌人实行群众专政，解放军支左人员首先同革委会成员一道，学习了毛主席的教导：“没有把群众发动起来，没有群众的监督，就不可能对反动分子和坏分子实行有效的专政，也不可能对他们进行有效的改造，他们就会继续捣乱，还有复辟的可能。”革委会成员还结合本单位的情况进行了研究分析。他们认识到，无产阶级文化大革命的每一个胜利，都是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。无论在什么场合，只要发动群众，依靠群众，革命就胜利；脱离群众，以至镇压群众，革命必然会失败。因此，对阶级敌人必须打一场“人民战争”。
    接着，支左人员同革委会成员，用毛主席的有关教导和党的一系列方针政策武装干部和群众，使他们划清了无产阶级专政同资产阶级反动路线的根本区别：资产阶级反动路线是把矛头指向群众，而无产阶级专政则是把矛头指向一小撮阶级敌人。同时使大家认识到，对于犯过错误、但又不是死不悔改的人，党一贯执行毛主席的“惩前毖后，治病救人”的政策，而不是一棍子打死。
    解放军支左人员又组织大家学习了毛主席有关阶级斗争的一系列教导，联系本单位阶级斗争的实际，彻底戳穿了阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，揭露了他们的反革命面目。这样，大家都解除了思想顾虑，轻装上阵，团结对敌。
  把大多数干部团结到革委会周围
    毛主席教导我们：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”革委会成员从毛主席这一教导中领会到，只有运用阶级分析的方法，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，坚定不移地团结真正的朋友，才能稳准狠地打击阶级敌人。他们认为，革命干部有着丰富的阶级斗争经验和工作能力，可以在对敌斗争中发挥重要作用。因此，遵照毛主席的干部政策，团结绝大多数干部，是向一小撮阶级敌人进攻的重要一环。于是，革委会成员和支左人员一道，以毛泽东思想为武器，首先对本单位的干部进行了认真的具体的分析。
    张北县金融系统的党内一小撮走资派，曾经疯狂地推行了中国赫鲁晓夫“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，把干部当成打击对象，让大多数干部靠边站了。这些干部中的许多人出身于贫苦家庭，不少人在旧社会讨过饭，当过长工，他们对国民党反动派有着深刻的仇恨，对伟大领袖毛主席有着深厚的无产阶级感情。有些人虽然犯有这样或那样的错误，但他们是要革命的，是坚决走社会主义道路、忠实地为无产阶级和劳动人民服务的。有的人虽然有些一般的历史问题，但同叛徒、特务、反革命分子有严格的区别。有的人尽管在无产阶级文化大革命初期一度执行了资产阶级反动路线，但他们同样是受害者，同走资派有着本质的区别。通过批评教育，他们是完全可以觉悟过来的。
    在分析过程中，他们严格划清了执行过资产阶级反动路线的干部同走资派的界限，有一般历史问题的干部同叛徒、特务、反革命分子的界限。经过这样认真细致的工作，大家一致认识到，在干部队伍中，混入的坏人是极少数，绝大多数干部的问题是属于人民内部矛盾。
    革委会遵照毛主席关于干部问题的教导，采取“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的方法，热情帮助干部自觉革命。凡是可以解放的，他们坚决解放；已经解放出来的，紧紧地把他们团结在革委会的周围，在对敌斗争中充分发挥他们的作用。很多干部激动地表示：绝不辜负伟大领袖毛主席的关怀和期望，一定要在对敌斗争中立功补过。
    发挥绝大多数群众的主力军作用
    为了团结绝大多数群众共同对敌，革委会成员同支左人员一起学习了毛主席关于
  “要坚决相信大多数群众是好的，坏人是极少数”的教导，联系本单位的实际，进一步认识到，广大革命群众对毛主席感情最深，对社会主义最爱，他们有鲜明的爱和憎；至于有些人说错了话，做错了事，大多数属于认识问题，是一时上了阶级敌人的当，通过批评教育是完全可以觉悟的。革委会严格划清了受蒙蔽的群众同极少数坏头头的界限，说错话、做错事、站错队的群众同一贯坚持反动立场的坏人的界限。
    当地银行中有一个警卫工作人员，在无产阶级文化大革命中受阶级敌人操纵干了一些坏事。在对敌斗争中，有人主张把他拉到大会上批斗。究竟该不该批斗？革委会引导大家对这个同志的情况进行了阶级分析：他出身于贫苦农民家庭，从小给地主放猪放羊，一九四五年参加革命，一九四六年加入中国共产党，在历次政治运动中表现都比较积极。只是由于他忽视思想改造，头脑中的“私”字膨胀，被阶级敌人所利用。大家认为，这个犯了错误的同志，和一贯坚持反动立场的坏家伙性质不同，应当团结和教育他。因为多团结一个受蒙蔽的群众，就多增加一份革命力量。于是，大家遵照毛主席关于“惩前毖后，治病救人”的教导，通过严肃的批评教育，热情地帮助他认识错误，改正错误，迅速地回到了毛主席无产阶级革命路线上来。
    张北县金融系统革命委员会由于严格分清了敌我，正确处理了两类不同性质的矛盾，团结了一切可以团结的革命力量和同盟军，最大限度地孤立了一小撮阶级敌人，使革委会在同阶级敌人的斗争中日益巩固和发展。
