The revolutionary committee of the state-owned Guyuan Pasture, with the help of the military supporting the left, uses a class perspective to analyze the new tricks and new trends of class enemies. They hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, organizing the masses to study Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, further raising their awareness of class struggle and line struggle. They resolutely implement party policies, strictly differentiate between two types of contradictions, unite all forces that can be united, and accurately and resolutely strike a small number of class enemies.

The revolutionary committee of the state-owned Guyuan Pasture in Hebei Province, with the help of the military supporting the left, resolutely implements Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, firmly grasps the direction of the struggle, and combines revolutionary spirit with a scientific attitude. They continuously launch fierce attacks on class enemies without any slack, implementing party policies without the slightest negligence. They strictly differentiate between two types of contradictions, unite all forces that can be united, and accurately and resolutely strike a small number of class enemies.

After the establishment of the revolutionary committee of Guyuan Pasture, following Chairman Mao's instructions to "never forget class struggle," they led the revolutionary masses to start from the major principles of the struggle between the two lines, deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, and continuously launch fierce attacks on a small number of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, dealing them heavy blows.

Chairman Mao teaches: "Representatives of various exploiting classes, when they are in unfavorable situations, in order to protect their current survival and future development, often adopt a strategy of attacking to defend themselves." When these class enemies are swept away by the revolutionary tide and have nowhere to hide, they use the despicable method of seizing a few superficial phenomena to attack the essence of things. They specifically seize on individual shortcomings in the work of the revolutionary committee, use them as an excuse, and make a big fuss, attempting to deny the revolutionary committee's direction of struggle. They maliciously say, "The old party committee's account of implementing the bourgeois reactionary line has not been settled, and the revolutionary committee has implemented a new bourgeois reactionary line." The rumors of the class enemies made some members of the revolutionary committee and part of the masses produce the idea of "fear," worrying about committing directional and line errors, and thus showing weakness in the struggle against the enemy.

Is launching an attack on traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and all untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists a "new bourgeois reactionary line"? Members of the revolutionary committee and military supporting the left together used a class perspective to analyze the new tricks and new trends of the class enemies. Everyone realized that this is a new tactic adopted by the class enemies in the face of fierce attacks from the revolutionary masses. They attempt to confuse right and wrong, create chaos, and protect their own survival, waiting for an opportunity to counterattack. To smash the new conspiracies of the class enemies, the revolutionary committee immediately held a study class focused on learning Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle. They organized the masses to study Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle and severely criticized and exposed the crimes of the bourgeois reactionary line fabricated by the Chinese Khrushchev. They guided everyone to analyze and compare the proletarian dictatorship led by the revolutionary committee with the bourgeois reactionary line implemented by the old party committee. Everyone clearly realized: The bourgeois reactionary line implemented by the old party committee was to suppress the broad masses of the people, aiming to extinguish the blazing flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; the revolutionary masses led by the revolutionary committee launching an attack on a small number of class enemies is under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, aiming to protect the revolutionary masses, strike a small number of class enemies, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. The former represents the interests of a small number of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists; the latter represents the fundamental interests of the broad revolutionary masses. The former relies on the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries and social dregs; the latter relies on the broad revolutionary masses. The former aims to strike down a large number of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses to maintain the reactionary rule of the bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the party, attempting to restore capitalism; the latter aims to strike a small number of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, to maintain the new revolutionary power representing the interests of the broad revolutionary masses. The two are fundamentally different and have nothing in common. The revolutionary masses saw through the new tricks of the class enemies and angrily said: "The more the enemy fears us taking up class struggle, the more we must hold fast to this key and accurately and resolutely strike the class enemies, absolutely not showing mercy."

Under the leadership of the revolutionary committee, the broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses further launched a campaign of exposure, criticism, and struggle against a small number of class enemies. In the struggle against the enemy, they followed Chairman Mao's teachings that "policy and strategy are the lifeblood of the party," paying great attention to the strategy and methods of struggle, and seriously implementing the policy of "using ideological struggle, not armed struggle." As a result, they exposed a small number of traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries who had disguised themselves and infiltrated the revolutionary mass organizations.

Class enemies are never willing to accept their defeat. To escape the punishment of the revolutionary masses, they again raised the slogan of "cleansing poison," attempting to direct the struggle towards revolutionary mass organization leaders who had made some mistakes in the past and masses who had been temporarily deceived. Members of the revolutionary committee and military supporting the left further went to the front lines of class struggle, helping the broad revolutionary workers to seriously study and master Chairman Mao's series of policies and principles on the struggle against the enemy, strengthening in-depth and detailed investigation and research work, and strictly differentiating between two types of contradictions. They guided the revolutionary masses to draw several lines, such as: distinguishing between the black hands that have infiltrated the revolutionary ranks and the leaders of mass organizations who have done some bad things due to being deceived; within mass organizations, distinguishing between bad elements who have infiltrated the revolutionary mass organizations and deceived masses; distinguishing between traitors, spies, counter-revolutionaries, and those with general historical problems; distinguishing between those among the five categories of people who have accepted reform and those who are unrepentant diehards, and so on.

After drawing the policy lines, the revolutionary masses had clearer minds and sharper eyes. They followed Chairman Mao's teachings that "the methods of resolving the two types of contradictions are different" and used the iron fist of the proletarian dictatorship to deal with a small number of class enemies. They used the method of "unity-criticism and self-criticism-unity" to correctly handle revolutionary mass organization leaders who had made mistakes and masses who had been temporarily deceived. A leader of the original "Red Rebel Corps" was deceived by a capitalist-roader within the pasture and a traitor, "Homecoming Corps" member who had infiltrated the mass organization, and did many bad things. When the faces of the class enemies were exposed, some people also treated him as a bad person. At this time, members of the revolutionary committee and military supporting the left studied Chairman Mao's teachings with everyone: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of the revolution." Everyone paid more attention to implementing party policies, strictly distinguishing between leaders of mass organizations who had made some mistakes and the class enemies behind them, and based on the principle of starting from the desire for unity and making strict demands, actively approached him, and gave him warm help. After a hard and detailed ideological and political work, he finally raised his awareness of class struggle and line struggle, fully recognized his mistakes, and actively joined the face-to-face exposure and struggle against the class enemies. Some deceived masses, under the call of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, quickly woke up, put down their burdens, and bravely joined the struggle against the enemy. In this way, they both carried forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletarian revolutionaries and united all forces that could be united, accurately and resolutely striking a small number of class enemies. In addition, in the struggle against the enemy, they also carried out work to split and disintegrate a small number of class enemies, implementing the policy of "leniency for those who confess, severity for those who resist," and isolating a small number of diehard elements to the maximum extent.

    用战无不胜的毛泽东思想挂帅  稳准狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人
    国营沽源牧场革委会在支左解放军帮助下，用阶级观点分析阶级敌人的新花招、新动向；举办毛泽东思想学习班，组织广大群众学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述，进一步提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟；坚决贯彻党的政策，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，团结一切可以团结的力量，打击一小撮阶级敌人
    本报讯　河北省国营沽源牧场革命委员会，在解放军支左人员的帮助下，坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，把革命精神与科学态度紧密结合起来，不停顿地向阶级敌人猛烈进攻，执行党的政策一丝一毫不马虎。他们严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，团结一切可以团结的力量，稳准狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人。
    沽源牧场革委会成立以后，按照毛主席关于“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，带领广大革命群众，从两条路线斗争的大是大非出发，深入开展革命大批判，不停顿地向一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派和没有改造好的地富反坏右分子，发起猛烈进攻，给了他们以沉重打击。
    毛主席教导说：“各种剥削阶级的代表人物，当着他们处在不利情况的时候，为了保护他们现在的生存，以利将来的发展，他们往往采取以攻为守的策略。”这一小撮阶级敌人被革命洪流冲得无处藏身的时候，他们就用抓住若干表面现象，攻击事情的本质的卑劣手法，专门抓住革委会工作中的个别缺点，借题发挥，大作文章，妄图否定革委会的斗争大方向。他们胡说什么“旧党委推行资产阶级反动路线的账还没算清，革委会又执行了新的资产阶级反动路线。”阶级敌人的流言蜚语，使革委会个别成员和部分群众产生了“怕”字，担心犯方向路线错误，从而产生了对敌斗争手软的现象。
    向叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派和一切没有改造好的地富反坏右分子发动进攻是“新的资产阶级反动路线”吗？革委会成员和解放军支左人员一起，用阶级观点，分析了阶级敌人的这一新花招、新动向。大家认识到，这是阶级敌人在广大革命群众猛烈进攻下所采取的以攻为守的一种新手法。他们妄想混淆是非，制造混乱，以保护他们自己的生存，伺机反扑。为了粉碎阶级敌人的新阴谋，革委会立即举办以学习毛主席关于阶级斗争的教导为主要内容的学习班，组织广大群众学习了毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述，同时狠批狠揭中国赫鲁晓夫炮制的资产阶级反动路线的罪行，引导大家对革委会领导下的无产阶级专政同旧党委推行的资产阶级反动路线加以分析对比。大家清楚地认识到：旧党委执行的资产阶级反动路线是对广大人民群众进行镇压，目的是扑灭无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火；革委会领导下的革命群众对一小撮阶级敌人进攻，是在毛主席革命路线指引下的无产阶级专政，目的是保护广大革命群众，打击一小撮阶级敌人，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。前者代表的是一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派和没有改造好的地富反坏右分子的利益；后者代表的是广大革命人民群众的根本利益。前者依靠的是国民党反动派的残余势力和社会渣滓；后者依靠的是广大革命人民群众。前者是为了打击“一大片”革命干部和革命群众，维护钻进党内的资产阶级代表人物的反动统治，企图复辟资本主义；后者是为了打击一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派和没有改造好的地富反坏右分子，维护代表广大革命人民群众利益的新生革命政权。两者有根本的区别，毫无共同之处。广大革命群众看穿了阶级敌人的新花招，气愤地说：“敌人越害怕我们抓阶级斗争，我们就越要抓住阶级斗争这条纲不放，稳、准、狠地打击阶级敌人，绝不能心慈手软。”
    广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，在革委会的率领下，向一小撮阶级敌人进一步展开了大揭发、大批判、大斗争。在对敌斗争中，他们遵照毛主席关于“政策和策略是党的生命”的教导，十分注意斗争的策略和方法，认真贯彻执行了“要用文斗，不用武斗”的方针。结果揪出了一小撮乔装打扮混进革命群众组织的叛徒、特务和反革命分子。
    阶级敌人总是不甘心于自己的失败的，为了逃脱革命群众的惩罚，他们又打出“有毒就肃”的口号，妄图把斗争矛头引向过去犯过一些错误的革命群众组织头头和一时受过蒙蔽的群众。革委会成员和支左人员进一步深入阶级斗争第一线，帮助广大革命职工认真学习和掌握毛主席关于对敌斗争的一系列方针政策，加强深入细致的调查研究工作，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾。他们引导革命群众划清了几条界限，这就是：划清伸进革命队伍里的黑手，与由于受了蒙蔽而干过一些坏事的群众组织头头的界限；在群众组织内部，又注意划清混进革命群众组织的坏人，与受蒙蔽群众的界限；划清叛徒、特务、反革命分子，与有一般历史问题的人的界限；划清五类分子中接受改造的，与死不悔改的顽固分子的界限，等等。
    在划清政策界限之后，革命群众心更明，眼更亮，他们遵照毛主席关于“敌我之间和人民内部这两类矛盾的性质不同，解决的方法也不同”的教导，用无产阶级专政的铁拳对付一小撮阶级敌人；用“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的方法，正确对待犯有错误的革命群众组织头头和一时受蒙蔽的群众。原“红色造反团”一个头头，在场内走资派和一个混进群众组织内部的叛徒、“还乡团”分子的蒙骗下，干了不少坏事。当阶级敌人的面貌被揭发和暴露以后，有人也把他与坏人一样对待。这时，革委会成员和支左解放军同大家一起学习了毛主席的教导：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”大家更加注意贯彻执行党的政策，把犯过一些错误的群众组织的头头同他背后的阶级敌人严格区别开来，本着既从团结的愿望出发又严格要求的原则，主动接近他，对他进行了热情的帮助。经过一番艰苦细致的思想政治工作，终于使他提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，充分认识到了自己的错误，积极起来与阶级敌人展开了面对面的揭发和斗争。一些受过蒙蔽的群众，在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的感召下，也迅速觉醒过来，放下包袱，勇敢地投入了对敌斗争。这样既发扬了无产阶级革命派的彻底革命精神，又团结了一切可以团结的力量，稳、准、狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人。此外，在对敌斗争中，对一小撮阶级敌人也进行了分化瓦解工作，执行了“坦白从宽，抗拒从严”的政策，把一小撮死硬分子最大限度地孤立了起来。
