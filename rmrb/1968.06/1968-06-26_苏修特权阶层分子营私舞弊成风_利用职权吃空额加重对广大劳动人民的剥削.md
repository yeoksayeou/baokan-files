	Soviet revisionist privileged class members engage in corruption and embezzlement. They use their authority to embezzle funds, further exploiting the broad masses of laboring people.

	According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 21st, a clique of Soviet revisionist privileged class members are rampant in corruption and embezzlement. Using their authority to embezzle funds is a new way they have recently found to exploit laboring people.

	According to the Soviet revisionist newspaper *Komsomolskaya Pravda*, the director of the Plant Protection Station in Donetsk Oblast, Krivenko, falsely reported a large number of production team members and forced the production team members to complete monthly production tasks for the falsely reported names. In a production team called Malyvanne, out of the 29 names listed on the payroll, 15 were made up. Under a production team called Kostylev, two "collectives" were established, entirely composed of falsely reported names. The production team members worked hard for the falsely reported names, and the money earned flowed into the pockets of the director of the Plant Protection Station.

	According to the Soviet revisionist newspaper *Izvestia*, the director of the art studio in the Ukrainian Social Advertising Company, Grasykin, is also skilled in the method of embezzlement. Grasykin listed a female furnace worker in the studio as a painter. Every time payday came, "Grasykin would sign for her, and the money would go into his own pocket."

	Grasykin also found some partners to sign for him. For example, he found a middle school administrator who "liked to make extra money." Here is their conversation during the deal:

	Grasykin said: "We need a painter... temporary work... so I thought of you."

	The administrator was surprised: "What kind of painter am I? I've never held a paintbrush."

	"Not to hold a paintbrush."

	"What then?"

	"Sign on the receipt."

	"That's fine, how much will you pay?"

	"Ten rubles."

	"The price for my signature is too low."

	Grasykin was angry but held back. He said: "Fifteen rubles, okay?"

	The administrator finally said: "Alright, that's fine."

	They struck a deal. The administrator became a "living machine" for Grasykin to sign his own name on the payroll, for which he received fifteen rubles every half month. Grasykin thus received an additional 140 to 170 rubles in salary each month, minus the thirty rubles paid for the signature, all of which he kept for himself.

### 苏修特权阶层分子营私舞弊成风  利用职权吃空额加重对广大劳动人民的剥削

    苏修特权阶层分子营私舞弊成风
    利用职权吃空额加重对广大劳动人民的剥削
    据新华社二十一日讯　莫斯科消息：苏修一小撮特权阶层分子营私舞弊成风，利用职权吃空额是他们最近剥削劳动人民的一种新方式。
    据苏修《共青团真理报》透露，顿涅茨克州植物保护站站长克里文科大量虚报生产队员名额，并要生产队员为他虚报的名额完成每月生产任务。在一个叫马莱万内的生产队里，在工资单上登记的二十九个姓名中，有十五个是凭空想出来的。在一个叫科斯蒂列夫的生产队之下，建立了两个完全由虚报的名额组成的“集体”。生产队员拚命为虚报的名额工作，而赚来的钱，大量地、源源不绝地落进了这个植物保护站站长的腰包。
    据苏修《消息报》透露，乌克兰社会广告公司系统的画室主任格拉西金也擅长吃空额的办法。格拉西金把画室的一位女烧炉工列入画家的名册，每次发工资时，“格拉西金就替她签字，而钞票则装进了自己的口袋”。
    格拉西金还物色一些替他签字的合伙者。例如他找到了一个“喜欢赚外快”的中学庶务主任。请看他们在做交易时的对话：
    格拉西金说：“需要一个画家……临时工作……于是就想到了你。”
    庶务主任惊奇地说：“我算什么画家？我从来就没有拿过画笔。”
      “不是让你拿画笔。”
      “那让我干什么？”
      “在收条上签名。”
      “这还行，那你给多少钱？”
      “十个卢布。”
      “对我的签名的定价太低了。”
    格拉西金心里发火，但是忍住了。他说：“十五个卢布行了吧。”
    庶务主任最后说：“好吧，就这样吧。”
    他们拍板成交了。庶务主任充当了为格拉西金在工资表上签自己名字的“活机器”，为此他每半个月得到十五个卢布。格拉西金于是每月又多领一百四十到一百七十卢布工资，除了付出签名费三十个卢布外，他全部据为己有。
