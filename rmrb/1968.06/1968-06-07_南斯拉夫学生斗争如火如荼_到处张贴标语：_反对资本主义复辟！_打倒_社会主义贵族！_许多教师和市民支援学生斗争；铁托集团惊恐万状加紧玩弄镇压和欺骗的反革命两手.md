The student struggle in Yugoslavia is intensifying. Slogans such as "Oppose the restoration of capitalism!" and "Down with the 'socialist' aristocracy!" are plastered everywhere. Many teachers and citizens are supporting the student struggle; the Tito clique is in a state of panic, hastily resorting to both repression and deception in their counter-revolutionary tactics.

	BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) — The progressive student movement in Yugoslavia continues to surge forward.

	According to reports, on June 5, students at Belgrade University occupied all departments of the university. They hoisted red flags on the buildings and corridors, and plastered slogans reading: "Workers of the world, unite!" "Oppose the restoration of capitalism!" "Down with the 'red' bourgeoisie!" "Down with the 'socialist' aristocracy!" and "Let the children of workers and peasants study!" Many students also distributed leaflets on the streets, denouncing the reactionary rule of the Tito clique and protesting against the police's brutal suppression of students.

	Belgrade University students make up one-third of the country's student population. This time, they are at the forefront of the struggle against the reactionary rule of the Tito clique. They have expressed their determination to fight to the end. According to reports, many professors at Belgrade University have resigned from their university positions to support the students' struggle. Many teachers and staff members have also held rallies in support of the students.

	The struggle of Belgrade University students has continued to receive support from students across Yugoslavia in recent days. Students at the large northern city of Zagreb University held a rally, enthusiastically supporting the struggle of Belgrade University students, and demanding democracy, university reforms, and the abolition of various privileges in society to eliminate the phenomenon of a few people getting rich. They angrily denounced the Yugoslav police's brutal suppression of students and strongly demanded the cancellation of the unreasonable decision made by the Belgrade police authorities on June 4, which banned gatherings and parades. In Sarajevo, more than 3,000 university students held a rally and parade on June 4, but were brutally suppressed by the police. Despite the police's obstruction and beatings, the students broke through three lines of police and demonstrated in front of the administrative building of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, receiving strong support from the citizens.

	The Tito clique is in a state of panic over the students' revolutionary actions. In recent days, the Yugoslav authorities have held "emergency meetings" and issued statements, shamelessly resorting to both repression and deception in their counter-revolutionary tactics. On one hand, they hypocritically claim to consider some of the students' demands, while on the other hand, they order a ban on "all parades, rallies, demonstrations, and processions in the streets, squares, and other public places in Belgrade." They threaten to use force against any students participating in parades and demonstrations. According to reports, more than a hundred students have already been brutally injured by the police.

    南斯拉夫学生斗争如火如荼
    到处张贴标语：“反对资本主义复辟！”“打倒‘社会主义’贵族！”
    许多教师和市民支援学生斗争；铁托集团惊恐万状加紧玩弄镇压和欺骗的反革命两手
    新华社六日讯　贝尔格莱德消息：南斯拉夫进步学生运动的浪潮继续向前发展。
    据报道，五日，贝尔格莱德大学的学生已经占领了贝尔格莱德大学的所有各系。他们在学校的楼房和交通道上插上了红旗，并贴满了标语，上面写着：“全世界无产者联合起来！”“反对资本主义复辟！”“打倒‘红色’资产阶级！”“打倒‘社会主义’贵族”和“让工农子弟学习”等标语。许多学生还在大街上散发传单，谴责铁托集团的反动统治，抗议警察对学生进行镇压的暴行。
    贝尔格莱德大学学生占南斯拉夫全国大学生的三分之一。这次他们站在反抗铁托集团反动统治的斗争的前列。他们表示要坚决斗争到底。据报道，贝尔格莱德大学的许多教授辞去了大学职务，声援大学生的斗争。许多教师和职员也纷纷举行声援学生的集会。
    贝尔格莱德大学生的斗争，连日来继续得到南斯拉夫各地学生的声援。南斯拉夫北部大城萨格勒布大学生举行集会，热情支持贝尔格莱德大学生的斗争，并要求民主，要求改革大学和取消社会上的各种特权，消除少数人发财致富的现象，消除剥削。他们愤怒谴责南修警察对学生的蛮横镇压，并强烈要求取消贝尔格莱德警察当局四日颁布的不准集会和游行的无理决定。在萨拉热窝，三千多名大学生四日举行了集会和游行，但遭到了警察的蛮横镇压。学生们不顾警察的阻挠和殴打，冲破了警察的三道防线，到波斯尼亚—  黑塞哥维那共和国的南修行政机构前举行示威，他们的行动得到了市民们的大力支持。
    铁托集团对学生的革命行动恐慌万状。连日来，南修当局连续召开“紧急会议”，并发表声明，大肆玩弄镇压和欺骗的反革命两手。他们一方面假惺惺地表示要考虑学生的一些要求，另方面下令“禁止在贝尔格莱德的大街、广场和其他公开场所举行一切游行、集会、示威和列队行进”。他们扬言要对任何参加游行示威的学生使用武力。据报道，现在，被警察野蛮打伤的学生已达一百多人。
