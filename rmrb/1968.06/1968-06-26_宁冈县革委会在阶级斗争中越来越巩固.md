The revolutionary committee of Ninggang County, a revolutionary base area, is carrying forward the glorious revolutionary traditions of Jinggangshan and is determined to remain forever linked with the masses.

The revolutionary committee of Ninggang County in Jiangxi Province, a revolutionary base area, is carrying forward the glorious revolutionary traditions of Jinggangshan, which was personally established by the great leader Chairman Mao. Members of the committee are leading the way in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing proletarian politics, mobilizing the masses to carry out a revolutionary criticism campaign, and striving to revolutionize the leadership cadre. They are determined to be lifelong servants of the people.

The New China News Agency, Nanchang, June 24—The revolutionary committee of Ninggang County, a revolutionary base area in Jiangxi Province, is carrying forward the glorious revolutionary traditions of Jinggangshan, which was personally established by the great leader Chairman Mao. Members of the committee are leading the way in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing proletarian politics, and striving to revolutionize the leadership cadre. They are determined to turn Ninggang County, with its glorious revolutionary traditions, into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Ninggang County is an important part of Jinggangshan, the first revolutionary base area established by Chairman Mao in China, and was the center of the armed struggle of workers and peasants in the Hunan-Jiangxi border region forty years ago. During the struggle to establish the Jinggangshan revolutionary base area, the great leader Chairman Mao personally led the people of Ninggang County in fighting the landlords, redistributing land, and establishing a red political power. The members of the Ninggang County revolutionary committee remember Chairman Mao's teachings to "carry forward the revolutionary traditions and strive for greater glory." They are determined to build the county revolutionary committee into a revolutionary command center that is loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They will lead the people of the entire county to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

There are countless tasks to be done,
But we must grasp the root.

Most members of the Ninggang County revolutionary committee come from poor and lower-middle peasants. Many of them participated in the revolution under Chairman Mao's direct leadership. After the revolutionary committee was established, there were countless tasks to be done, but they grasped the root of the matter by leading the way in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. They regard being loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line as the highest requirement for themselves. They regard studying, executing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's instructions as their most sacred duty.

As soon as the revolutionary committee was established, all members went to Longjiang Academy, where Chairman Mao had once established a training base for Red Army cadres, to hold the first Mao Zedong Thought study class. There, they studied Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles," his latest instructions, and his brilliant works such as "The Struggle in Jinggangshan" and "Why Can the Red Political Power in China Exist?" In addition to insisting on reading Chairman Mao's works every day and holding regular study sessions, the members of the revolutionary committee also went deep into the countryside to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. They organized various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Now, the entire county has held more than 1,100 study classes of various types, with more than 34,100 participants. To continuously push the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the entire county to new heights, the county revolutionary committee summarized the advanced experiences of Mao Zedong Thought study in four brigades: Maoping, Qilichuan, Zhuangqian, and Puling. They called on and organized the people of the entire county to learn from these four banners.

The leading members of the revolutionary committee respond to every battle call issued by the great leader Chairman Mao with a revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day." As soon as Chairman Mao's latest instructions are received, they quickly transmit and implement them throughout the county. They say, "Being loyal to Chairman Mao means following Chairman Mao closely. We must follow Chairman Mao's instructions step by step and carry them out resolutely."

While leading the masses to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, the Ninggang County revolutionary committee pays special attention to carrying out education on revolutionary traditions. They thoroughly study and discuss Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practices in Ninggang as an important part of realizing the revolutionization of the leadership cadre and turning the entire county into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought. To better study Mao Zedong Thought and never forget the revolutionary traditions of Jinggangshan, the county revolutionary committee holds relatively large-scale meetings. Participants bring their own luggage and walk to Maoping, where Chairman Mao once lived, to hold the meetings. There, the representatives often attend classes on revolutionary tradition education. Revolutionary old comrades and old Red Army soldiers are invited to talk about the great leader Chairman Mao's revolutionary practices in leading the people of the revolutionary base area in revolutionary struggles. They also talk about the traditional style of the Soviet government workers, who were frugal and connected with the masses, and their loyalty to Chairman Mao and their revolutionary spirit of following Chairman Mao closely. To carry out education on revolutionary traditions, the county revolutionary committee decided to make the four brilliant works of Chairman Mao, "Why Can the Red Political Power in China Exist?", "The Struggle in Jinggangshan", "The Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire", and "On Correcting Wrong Ideas in the Party" compulsory courses for revolutionary tradition education. They also lead the way in studying and applying these works well.

Carrying forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of Jinggangshan, we must grasp class struggle.

"Class struggle, once grasped, works wonders." The members of the revolutionary committee repeatedly study Chairman Mao's great teachings on class and class struggle. They deeply understand that to consolidate the newly established revolutionary committee, they must resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They must inherit and carry forward the thorough and decisive revolutionary spirit of Jinggangshan, take the initiative to launch attacks on the class enemy, and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

After the revolutionary committee was established, the standing committee members went deep into the masses. Together with the masses, they seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle. They extensively discussed the new situations, new problems, and new trends in class struggle, greatly raising the masses' awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. The revolutionary big criticism campaign was carried out more vigorously. When launching fierce attacks on the class enemy and exposing one class enemy after another, the leading members of the county revolutionary committee led the masses to hold class education exhibitions. They used living class struggle facts to educate the masses, further promoting the in-depth development of the revolutionary big criticism campaign.

To grasp the initiative in class struggle, break through one point and promote the overall situation, the standing committee members and main leading members of the revolutionary committee often go deep into the grassroots level. They rely on the masses, lead the masses, and bravely carry out the struggle against the enemy. For a period of time, some revolutionary cadres in the county supply and marketing cooperative and the tractor station were hesitant to act, causing the movement to stall. After discovering this situation, the leading members of the county revolutionary committee immediately went to these two units. Together with the revolutionary cadres and masses, they studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, helped the revolutionary cadres overcome their fears, and boosted their morale. The movement quickly reached a new high. Then, they held on-site meetings in these two units to help them summarize and exchange fighting experiences in a timely manner. The town of Luoshi, where the county seat is located, has complex and sharp class struggles. The leading members of the county revolutionary committee went to this town and, together with the masses, studied and implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the party's policies. They deployed battle plans, studied fighting strategies, and led the masses in face-to-face struggles against the class enemy. Because the leading members of the county revolutionary committee went to various places in the county, daring to mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and lead the masses into battle, deeply buried class enemies were one by one exposed. The revolutionary situation in the entire county is excellent, and the revolutionary committee is becoming more and more consolidated.

Closely linking with the masses, establishing a revolutionary style.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The revolutionary committee should implement unified leadership, break down the overlapping administrative organs, streamline the bureaucracy, and organize a revolutionary leadership cadre that is linked with the masses." The Ninggang County revolutionary committee, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, fully mobilizes the masses, relies on the masses, implements streamlining the bureaucracy, and gradually establishes a new revolutionary style and institutions that are beneficial to the people. The entire structure of the revolutionary committee has been greatly streamlined, and the number of staff has been reduced by two-thirds compared to the former county committee and county people's committee. The leading members and general staff of the revolutionary committee all work together, reducing levels, and implementing face-to-face leadership. They discuss and study together when encountering problems, so problems can be solved in a timely manner, and things can be done quickly and well.

In the process of realizing the revolutionization of the leadership cadre, the Ninggang County revolutionary committee, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings, "The reform of state organs, the most fundamental thing, is to link with the masses," carries forward the party's traditional style of hard work and plain living, and always maintains close contact with the masses. After the revolutionary committee was established, at the first standing committee meeting, they focused on studying how to go deep into the grassroots level and take root among the masses. The standing committee members all expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's words, wholeheartedly serve the people, and forever be linked with the masses as lifelong servants of the people.

Now, except for leaving one or two standing committee members to handle daily work, the other leading members all go deep into the grassroots level and the production front line, working with the poor and lower-middle peasants to carry out the revolution and promote production. Many standing committee members often carry Chairman Mao's works, pack their luggage, and go to communes and production brigades to stay for a period of time. They eat, live, and work with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and engage in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. During their stay, they pay special attention to going deep into the most difficult and backward communes and brigades, humbly listening to the opinions of the masses, discovering and understanding problems from the masses, and solving problems with the masses. The county revolutionary committee also regularly holds meetings with representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants to listen to their voices and solicit their opinions. Because the members of the county revolutionary committee go deep into the masses and solve problems in a timely manner, they fully believe in and rely on the broad masses of the people, respect the masses' pioneering spirit, and give full play to the masses' creativity and initiative. They promote the good situation to continue to develop. Now, all communes in the entire county have established revolutionary committees, and the revolutionary and production situation is getting better and better.

    发扬井冈山光荣革命传统  永远和群众血肉相连
    宁冈县革委会在阶级斗争中越来越巩固
    革委会成员带头活学活用毛主席著作，大力突出无产阶级政治，深入发动群众开展革命大批判，狠抓领导班子思想革命化，决心当一辈子人民的勤务员
    新华社南昌二十四日电　革命老根据地江西宁冈县革命委员会成员，继承和发扬伟大领袖毛主席亲手创建的井冈山革命根据地的革命传统，带头活学活用毛主席著作，大力突出无产阶级政治，狠抓阶级斗争和领导班子的革命化，决心把具有光荣革命传统的宁冈县办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    宁冈县是毛主席亲手创建的中国第一个革命根据地井冈山的重要组成部分，是当年湘赣边界工农武装割据的中心。四十多年前，伟大领袖毛主席在创建井冈山革命根据地的斗争中，亲自领导过宁冈人民打土豪，分田地，建立红色政权。宁冈县革命委员会的同志们牢记毛主席“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的教导，决心把县革委会建设成忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的革命战斗指挥部，带领全县革命人民把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    工作千头万绪，
      狠狠抓住根本
    宁冈县革委会的成员大部分出身于贫下中农，许多同志当年就在毛主席的直接领导下闹革命，对毛主席和毛泽东思想有着深厚的无产阶级感情。革委会成立以后，工作千头万绪，他们狠狠抓住根本，带头活学活用毛泽东思想，把忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线作为对自己的最高要求，把学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛主席的指示当做自己最神圣的职责。
    县革委会一成立，全体委员就到毛主席当年兴办红军教导队训练红军干部的龙江书院举办第一期毛泽东思想学习班，在那里学习了毛主席的“老三篇”，学习了毛主席的一系列最新指示和《井冈山的斗争》、《中国的红色政权为什么能够存在？》等光辉著作。革委会的同志除了坚持天天读毛主席著作和定期召开讲用会外，还深入农村，与广大农村基层干部和贫下中农一起活学活用毛泽东思想，大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。现在，全县共办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班一千一百多期，参加学习的达三万四千一百多人次。为了把全县活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动不断推向新高潮，县革委会总结了茅坪、七里船、庄前和蒲陇四个大队活学活用毛泽东思想的先进经验，号召并组织全县人民向这四面旗帜学习。
    县革委会的领导成员对伟大领袖毛主席发出的每一战斗号令，都以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，闻风而动，雷厉风行，坚决照办。每当毛主席的最新指示传来，他们都用最快的速度迅速向全县人民传达和贯彻。他们说，忠于毛主席就要紧跟毛主席。对毛主席的指示就是要步步紧跟，坚决照办。
    宁冈县革委会在带领群众活学活用毛泽东思想的同时，特别注意抓好革命传统教育，大学、大讲毛主席在宁冈的伟大革命实践，作为实现领导班子思想革命化、把全县办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校的一项重要内容。为了更好地学习毛泽东思想，永远不忘井冈山的革命传统，县革委会召开较大规模的会议时，与会人员都自带行李，步行到毛主席当年居住过的茅坪去召开。在这里，代表们经常上革命传统教育课，请革命老同志和老红军讲述伟大领袖毛主席当年领导革命老根据地人民进行革命斗争的伟大革命实践，讲述苏维埃政府工作人员艰苦朴素、联系群众的传统作风以及他们忠于毛主席、紧跟毛主席闹革命的情景。为了大力抓好革命传统教育，县革委会还决定把毛主席的《中国的红色政权为什么能够存在？》、《井冈山的斗争》、《星星之火，可以燎原》、《关于纠正党内的错误思想》这四篇光辉著作作为革命传统教育的必修课，并带头学好用好。
  发扬井冈山的彻底革命精神，狠抓阶级斗争
      “阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”革委会同志反复学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的伟大教导，深刻认识到，要巩固新生的革命委员会，就要坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，继承和发扬井冈山的坚决、彻底革命精神，主动地向阶级敌人发动进攻，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    革委会成立后，革委会常委就分头深入群众，和群众一起认真学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述，大讲特讲阶级斗争的新情况、新问题、新动向，使广大革命群众大大提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，把革命大批判更加如火如荼地开展起来。在向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，把一小撮阶级敌人一个个挖出来时，县革委会领导成员又领导群众举办阶级教育展览，用活生生的阶级斗争事实教育群众，进一步推动了革命大批判的深入开展。
    为了掌握阶级斗争的主动权，突破一点，推动全面，革委会常委和主要领导成员经常深入基层，依靠群众，带领群众，坚决勇敢地开展对敌斗争。县供销社、拖拉机站的部分革命干部，在一段时间里由于“怕”字当头，致使运动深入不下去。县革委会领导同志发现这一情况后立即深入到这两个单位，同革命干部、革命群众一起学习毛主席的最新指示，帮助革命干部解除顾虑，鼓舞斗志，运动很快掀起高潮。接着，又在这两个单位召开现场会，帮助他们及时总结和交流了斗争经验。县城所在地的砻市镇，阶级斗争很复杂、很尖锐。县革委会领导成员便在这个镇里和群众一起，学习和落实毛主席的最新指示和党的方针政策，部署战斗计划，研究斗争策略，带领群众同阶级敌人开展面对面的斗争。由于县革委会领导成员到全县各地，大胆放手发动群众，依靠群众，带领群众投入战斗，使埋藏得很深的阶级敌人一个个被挖了出来。全县革命形势一片大好，革命委员会越来越巩固。
        密切联系群众，树立革命作风
    毛主席教导我们：“革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”宁冈县革委会遵照毛主席这一指示，充分发动群众，依靠群众，实行精兵简政，逐步建立起崭新的革命作风和有利于人民的制度。整个革委会机构大大精简，工作人员比旧县委、县人委减少了三分之二。革委会的领导成员和一般工作人员都集中在一起办公，减少层次，实行面对面的领导，遇事一起商量、研究。这样问题能及时解决，事情办得又快又好。
    宁冈县革委会在实现领导班子思想革命化的过程中，遵照毛主席“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众”的教导，发扬我党艰苦朴素的传统作风，时刻保持与群众的密切联系。革委会成立后，在第一次常委会上，就着重研究了如何深入基层，扎根于群众的问题。常委们都表示要坚决听毛主席的话，全心全意地为人民服务，永远和群众血肉相连，当一辈子人民的勤务员。
    现在，这个县革委会除留一两名常委主持日常工作外，其余的领导成员都深入基层，深入生产第一线，与贫下中农一起抓革命，促生产。许多常委经常带着毛主席著作，背上行李到社、队去蹲点，与贫下中农同吃、同住、同劳动，同斗私批修。在蹲点过程中，他们特别注意带头深入到困难最多的后进的社队去，虚心听取群众的意见，从群众中发现和了解问题，并与群众一起解决问题。县革委会还定期召开贫下中农代表座谈会，倾听贫下中农的呼声，征求贫下中农的意见。由于县革委会成员深入群众及时解决问题，充分相信和坚决依靠广大人民群众，尊重群众的首创精神，充分发挥群众的创造性和积极性，推动大好形势不断向前发展，现在全县所有公社都已成立了革命委员会，革命和生产形势越来越好。
