The Office of the Dhofar Liberation Front in Cairo issued a statement on June 9th, marking the third anniversary of the armed struggle of the Dhofar people. The statement said: "Armed struggle against imperialism and colonialism is the only path for oppressed peoples to achieve national independence and sovereignty."

The statement reaffirmed that, regardless of the difficulties encountered, the Dhofar people are determined to continue the armed struggle until imperialism and its lackeys are eliminated and Dhofar is completely liberated.

Dhofar is located in the southeastern part of the Arabian Peninsula. Its western border adjoins the recently independent South Yemen.

The statement reviewed the significant achievements made by the Dhofar people in the past three years since the armed revolution erupted in the Dhofar Mountains on June 9, 1965. The statement said that the Dhofar people have now established their own liberation army, which enjoys widespread support from the people. The Dhofar Liberation Front has taken control of the northern region of Dhofar, where it has abolished various additional taxes levied by the British colonial authorities, implemented certain social reforms, conducted revolutionary political education among the people, and developed agricultural and livestock production.

The statement emphasized: "The Dhofar people persist in their liberation war against the British occupying forces and feudal rulers." The statement also said that if the Dhofar people had not taken up arms and formed the People's Liberation Army, revolutionary Dhofar would not be able to stand firm today against the powerful enemy.

    佐法尔解放阵线驻开罗办事处发表声明
    决心把武装斗争进行到底
    三年来武装斗争取得重大成就并建立自己的解放军
    新华社开罗九日电  佐法尔解放阵线驻开罗办事处九日就佐法尔人民开展武装斗争三周年在这里发表声明说：“对帝国主义和殖民主义进行武装斗争，是被压迫人民实现民族独立和主权的唯一道路。”
    声明重申，不管会碰到多少困难，佐法尔人民决心继续进行武装斗争，直到帝国主义及其走狗被消灭，直到佐法尔得到彻底解放。
    佐法尔位于阿拉伯半岛的东南部，它的西部同最近独立的南也门接界。
    声明回顾了自从一九六五年六月九日在佐法尔山爆发武装革命以来，佐法尔人民在过去三年中所取得的重大成就。声明说，佐法尔人民现在已经建立了自己的解放军，这支军队得到人民的广泛支持。佐法尔解放阵线已经控制了佐法尔的北部地区，在那里，废除了英国殖民当局所征收的各种附加税，实行了某些社会改革，在人民中间进行了革命的政治教育，农业和畜牧业生产得到了发展。
    声明强调说：“佐法尔人民坚持对英国占领军和封建统治者进行解放战争。”声明还说，如果佐法尔人民不拿起武器，没有人民解放军，革命的佐法尔就不能象今天这样屹立在强大的敌人面前。
