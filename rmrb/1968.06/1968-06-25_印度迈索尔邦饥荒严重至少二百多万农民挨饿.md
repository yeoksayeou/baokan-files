The Indian state of Mysore, located in the southwestern part of the country, is currently experiencing a severe famine. According to the reactionary government of the state, which has significantly downplayed the figures, at least 21 million farmers are suffering from the famine. Out of the state's 19 districts, all except three are affected by the famine. In the state's 26,000 villages, half of them are experiencing severe famine conditions.

According to reports in Indian newspapers, several other regions in India, including the states of Assam, West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, and Mysore, are also experiencing severe famines this year.

The famine in India is the result of the cruel oppression and exploitation of the Indian people by the Indian landlords and big bourgeoisie in collusion with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. The Indian reactionary government has tried to cover up this fact, but in vain. The Indian government attributes the severe famine to "drought," but Indian Food and Agriculture State Minister Hinde stated in the Indian Parliament on April 11 of this year that the climate conditions in India this year are good. The words of the Indian officials have inadvertently exposed the lies of the Indian government, revealing the true nature of their fabricated excuses.

    印度迈索尔邦饥荒严重至少二百多万农民挨饿
    新华社二十三日讯 新德里消息：据印度资产阶级报纸《印度时报》报道，位于印度西南部的迈索尔邦今年发生严重的饥荒。据邦反动政府的大大缩小了的估计，这个邦遭受饥荒的农民达到了二百一十多万人。全邦十九个县中，除三个县以外，都发生了饥荒。在这个邦的二万六千个村庄中，有一半的村庄发生严重饥荒。
    据印度报纸陆续透露，印度今年发生严重饥荒的已有阿萨姆邦、西孟加拉邦、比哈尔邦、奥里萨邦、安得拉邦以及迈索尔邦等广大地区。
    印度的饥荒，是印度大地主、大资产阶级勾结美帝、苏修残酷压迫和剥削印度广大农民的结果。印度反动政府极力掩盖这个事实，但是，这是徒劳的。印度政府把发生严重饥荒的原因归之于“旱灾”，然而，印度粮食和农业部国务部长欣德今年四月十一日在印度议会谈印度的粮食生产问题时说，今年印度的气候条件是好的。印度官员的话正好打了印度政府的嘴巴，无意中露出了印度政府编造的谎言的马脚。
