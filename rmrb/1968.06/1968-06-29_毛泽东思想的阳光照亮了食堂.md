The Sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought Illuminates the Canteen

The Mao Zedong Thought study class at the Huangtian Canteen of the Longyan Iron Mine in Hebei Province uses the method of studying one of Chairman Mao's instructions and implementing one action, bringing the study class to the masses. They went deep into the workers' dormitories, actively solicited opinions; went deep into the mines, labored, lived, and established deep class feelings with the workers. They took the initiative to address the workers' urgent needs and think about what the workers think about, greatly improving the catering work. Someone praised this canteen as a "workers' home" bathed in the sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought.

The Huangtian Canteen of the Longyan Iron Mine is located in a remote mountain ridge at the foot of the Yanshan Mountains. The entire canteen has thirteen catering staff members, serving over three hundred single workers. Due to the influence of old habits, there used to be a saying in the canteen: "Among the seventy-two trades, everything can be done except being a cook." More than half of the thirteen people did not want to do the work of washing pots and pans. An old cook said, "Do anything but this job, it's all about smoke and fire every day." Because of these knots in their minds, they often spoke roughly: "This food, this dish, if you want to eat, buy it; if you don't want to eat, forget it!" Everyone's evaluation of the canteen was four "mores" (more people unwilling to work in the canteen, more arguments with workers, more leftovers, more complaints from workers) and two "colds" (cold rice, cold dishes) old three items (buckwheat, steamed buns, and flatbread).

Learning with Questions

In January of this year, the canteen started a Mao Zedong Thought study class. Through intense focus on the fundamental attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, through class education, recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness, the catering staff participated in the study class with deep proletarian feelings for the great leader Mao. However, due to their low level of education, they found it difficult to study long articles, so they adopted the method of studying a little and discussing a lot, bringing one question, establishing one viewpoint, and implementing one action.

Everyone brought the question of "not being willing to work in the catering department" to study Chairman Mao's "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and the teaching of "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism," establishing the viewpoint of "wholeheartedly serving the people." Everyone repeatedly studied and repeatedly compared, realizing that the root of the thought of "not wanting to do this job" is a "selfish" character. One must eliminate selfish thoughts and consider oneself a revolutionary seed. Wherever the Party places one, one must take root and bloom there. A cook who had just joined the canteen not long ago said, "In the past, I thought I was young, washing pots and cooking, lowly and unworthy; now, using the 'wholeheartedly' ruler to measure, using the image of Zhang Side to compare, I feel that doing catering work for the revolution and for the people is very glorious, I am willing to do it for a lifetime."

Everyone then brought the question of "why there are so many complaints from the masses" to study Chairman Mao's "In Memory of Norman Bethune." At first, someone mentioned "the masses have complaints," always thinking that some people were nitpicking, finding bones in eggs. After everyone weighed it with the "complete and thorough" scale and measured it with the two "extremes" rulers, they found that it was not that the masses had too many complaints, but that there were still many complaints that had not been raised. They decided to implement the thought of serving the people in action, improving their work according to Chairman Mao's teachings.

Going to the Masses

How to improve? Someone proposed to believe in the masses and rely on the masses, to bring the study class to the masses, and actively solicit opinions from the masses. But someone was a bit worried, fearing that it would be in vain. The class leader encouraged everyone, "Believe in the masses." Thus, they went to the workers' dormitories with a try-it-out attitude. As soon as they entered the dormitory, the workers shouted, "Learn from the catering comrades! Pay tribute to the catering comrades!" Everyone was greatly encouraged.

During the solicitation of opinions, the more they talked with the workers, the more they felt close to each other. A worker raised such a suggestion: "You solicit opinions more, but improve work less, change more with your mouth, and change less with your hands." Why is the improvement slow? Why, despite everyone's great efforts, the work still does not meet the workers' expectations? Everyone brought this question to study Chairman Mao's teaching: "If you want to know the taste of a pear, you must transform the pear and taste it yourself." Through repeated discussions, everyone established another "practice" viewpoint in their minds, realizing that the reason the work did not meet the workers' expectations was that they did not understand the workers' labor situation and had not established deep class feelings with the workers.

Determination Comes from Practice

Everyone put on their work clothes and went deep into the mines to labor with the miners. After laboring for a day, a cook held up a dry flatbread and said to everyone, "No wonder the workers had complaints about us in the past. After laboring for a day, thirsty and parched, eating this hard flatbread, it's really hard to swallow!" Female cook Yan Suomin said, "We only labored once, and we were already tired with sore backs and legs, unable to eat or sleep well. But the workers labor in the mines day after day, wholeheartedly building socialism by mining stones. If we still give them cold rice and cold dishes, we really let down our worker brothers!" Through labor, everyone received a profound education. Everyone said, "We are class brothers. The production frontline mines more, and we in the rear must serve well." Cooks Liu Dong and Xue Wanbao said, "In the past, we did not improve our work quickly and thoroughly because we did not understand the workers' labor situation and had shallow class feelings for the workers. The wound was not on our own body, so we did not feel the pain, and the determination to treat it was not great. Buckwheat should originally be mixed with boiling water, but in the past, we were afraid of getting burned, so we used warm water, making it soft and hard, and the workers did not like to eat it. At first, we wanted to change, but without personal experience, the determination to change was not great. Now, seeing the workers' selfless labor spirit with our own eyes, we are no longer afraid of being burned by hot water." After that, they insisted on using boiling water to mix the buckwheat. When encountering difficulties, they would recite, "With firm determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." Sometimes their hands turned red from the heat, but when they saw the workers eating delicious hot meals, they would happily say, "As long as the workers are satisfied, we feel comfortable in our hearts."

Putting It into Action

From then on, the situation at the food service window completely changed. The workers enjoyed their meals, and the catering staff were happy and couldn't close their mouths; the workers didn't enjoy their meals, and the catering staff were anxious and couldn't eat. Someone fell ill, and they went to the dormitories to visit. Worker Cui Zhanqing was injured at work, and the catering staff brought fragrant hot noodle soup to the dormitory. Cui Zhanqing was moved to tears and said, "Truly, the river is deep and the sea is deep, but not as deep as class love!" The catering staff also had deep feelings and said, "No matter how good it is, it is Chairman Mao who leads us well. No matter how many victories there are, they are all great victories of Mao Zedong Thought!" They summarized their experience of running the study class: "At first, our study class was held in the room, studied in books, and used in words. Now it is studied among the masses, imprinted in thoughts, and used in actions, and the work has changed!"

### 毛泽东思想的阳光照亮了食堂

专栏：在毛泽东思想学习班里

    毛泽东思想的阳光照亮了食堂
    河北省龙烟铁矿黄田食堂炊事人员毛泽东思想学习班，采用学习毛主席的一个指示，落实一个行动的方法，把学习班办到群众中去。他们深入职工宿舍，主动征求意见；深入矿井，和工人同劳动，同生活，同工人建立了深厚的阶级感情。他们急工人之急，想工人所想，大大改进了炊事工作。有人称赞这个食堂是一个沐浴着毛泽东思想阳光的“职工之家”。
    龙烟铁矿黄田食堂，座落在燕山脚下偏僻的山梁上。全食堂十三名炊事人员，服务对象是三百多名单身职工。由于受旧的习惯势力的影响，过去食堂里流传着一个“七十二行啥都干，唯独不当炊事员”的说法。十三个人中，半数以上不愿干刷锅洗碗这一行。一位老炊事员说：“干啥也别干这一行，整天是烟熏火燎的。”由于思想上结着这些疙瘩，他们动不动就粗声粗气地说：“就这饭，就这菜，愿吃就买，不愿吃就算！”大家对食堂的评价是四多（不安心食堂工作的多、和职工吵架的多、剩饭剩菜多、职工意见多）两冷（冷饭、冷菜）老三样（莜面、馒头、窝窝头）。
    带着问题学
    今年一月，这个食堂办起了毛泽东思想学习班。通过狠抓对毛主席和毛泽东思想的根本态度问题，通过阶级教育，忆苦思甜，炊事人员怀着对伟大领袖毛主席深厚的无产阶级感情积极参加了学习班学习。但是由于文化低，学长篇的文章有困难，大家就采取了少学多议，带一个问题，树立一个观点，落实一个行动的方法进行学习。
    大家带着“不安心炊事工作”的问题，学习毛主席的《为人民服务》和“要斗私，批修”的教导，树立起一个“全心全意地为人民服务”的观点。大家反复学习、反复对照，认识到“不愿干炊事工作这一行”的思想根源是一个“私”字。一定要根除私心杂念，把自己当作一粒革命的种子，党把自己放到哪里，就要在哪里生根开花。一位刚进食堂不久的炊事员说：“过去我觉得自己年轻轻的，刷锅做饭，低三下四没出息；现在用‘全心全意’这把尺子一衡量，用张思德的形象一对照，我觉得为革命、为人民干炊事工作光荣得很，我愿干一辈子。”
    大家又带着“为什么群众意见多”的问题，学习毛主席的《为人民服务》。开始有人一提起“群众有意见”，总认为有些人吹毛求疵，鸡蛋里挑骨头。经过大家用“完全、彻底”这杆秤一称，用两个“极端”这两把尺子一量，就发现不是大家的意见提多了，而是还有好多意见没有提出来。他们决心把为人民服务的思想落实到行动上，按照毛主席的教导去改进工作。
    到群众中去
    怎么改呢？有人提出要相信群众、依靠群众，要把学习班办到群众中去，主动征求群众意见。但有人有点担心，怕费力不讨好。班长鼓励大家“要相信群众”。于是，他们抱着试试看的想法到了工人宿舍。一进宿舍，工人们高喊：“向炊事员同志学习！向炊事员同志致敬！”大家受到很大鼓舞。
    在征求意见当中，和职工越谈越贴心。有位职工提出这样一条意见：“你们是征求意见多，改进工作少，嘴上改得多，手上改得少。”为什么改得慢？为什么大家费了很大的力气，工作还是作不到职工心眼里去？大家带着这个问题学习了毛主席的教导：“你要知道梨子的滋味，你就得变革梨子，亲口吃一吃。”通过反复议论，大家思想上又树立起一个“实践”的观点，认识到工作所以做不到职工心眼里去，就是因为不了解工人劳动的情况，没有和工人建立起深厚的阶级感情。
    决心来自实践
    大家穿上工作服，深入矿井，和矿工一起劳动。劳动一天回来后，一位炊事员拿起一个干窝头对大家说：“怪不得过去职工对我们有意见，劳动一天，口干舌燥，再吃这硬棒棒的窝窝头，可真是咽不下去呀！”女炊事员阎素敏说：“咱们只干了一次，就累得腰痛腿酸，吃不下，睡不好，可是工人们长年累月在井下，一心一意为建设社会主义采矿石，我们再给人家冷饭冷菜吃，可真对不起工人兄弟呀！”通过劳动，大家受到了一次深刻的教育。大家都说：“我们是阶级兄弟，生产前线多采矿，我们后方一定要服务好。”炊事员刘栋、薛万宝说：“过去我们工作改得不快不彻底，就是因为我们不了解工人劳动的情况，对职工的阶级感情不深。疮没有长在自己身上不觉痛，治起来就决心不大。和莜面本来应该用开水，可是过去由于怕烫手，就用温水和，做出来软硬不均，工人们不爱吃。开始想改，但没有亲身感受，改的决心不大。现在亲眼见到了工人们的忘我劳动精神，就是用再热的开水和面也不怕烫了。”此后，他们坚持用开水和面，碰到困难的时候就背诵：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”有时烫得两手发红，但当他们看到职工吃上适口的热饭热菜时，总是愉快地说：“只要职工满意了，我们心里就感到舒服。”
    用在行动上
    从此，售饭窗口的现象完全变了。职工吃饭香了，炊事人员乐得合不上嘴；职工吃饭不顺口了，炊事人员急得也吃不下饭。有人病了，他们深入宿舍去访问。工人崔占清出了工伤，炊事员就把喷香的热面汤送到宿舍。崔占清感动得热泪盈眶地说：“真是河深海深不如阶级友爱深！”炊事员也深有感触地说：“千好万好，是毛主席他老人家领导得好，千胜利万胜利，都是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！”他们总结办学习班的体会说：“开始，我们的学习班是办在屋子里，学在书本上，用在口头上。现在是学在群众中，印在思想上，用在行动上，工作就变样！”
