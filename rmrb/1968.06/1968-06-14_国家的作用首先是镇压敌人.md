Our state is a state of proletarian dictatorship. We need this proletarian dictatorship because there are imperialists abroad, to prevent subversive activities and invasions by foreign enemies; because there are classes domestically, to suppress reactionary classes and counter-revolutionaries that oppose socialism. As long as imperialism exists abroad and classes exist domestically, the primary task of our state organs is to deal with domestic and foreign enemies, to resolve the contradictions between us and them. However, the Chinese Khrushchev, this old fox and scoundrel in human skin, advocates the theory of the "extinction of class struggle," claiming that "the most important task of the state is to organize social life." He attempts to alter the nature of the state and abolish the proletarian dictatorship.

In a class society, class struggle is the root of all social phenomena. Before classes are eliminated, there will be no such thing as "social life" separate from class struggle. The biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party and their agents in various regions are precisely those who, under the black banner of "organizing social life," are engaged in extensive conspiracies to restore capitalism. During my time in Hefei supporting the left, I witnessed numerous facts that fully prove this. The agent of Chinese Khrushchev in Anhui Province, Li Baohua, is a typical example. He promoted the "three selfs and one contract" in rural areas, dismantling the socialist collective economy; in cities, he pushed for "welfare" and "health care," corrupting the cadre ranks.

What kind of "social life" do they want to organize? It is a thoroughly bourgeois social life, a class struggle of the bourgeoisie against the proletariat. If Chinese Khrushchev's scheme of "the most important task of the state is to organize social life" succeeds, our country will change color, and the proletariat and the working people will suffer twice.

What is alarming is that the poison of Chinese Khrushchev has not been completely eradicated. Now, when we are deeply engaged in revolutionary criticism, aren't there still people promoting counter-revolutionary economism? They say: "In the past, we were busy with movements, and issues like wages and housing were hard to resolve. Now that the revolutionary committees have been established, it is time to solve these problems." They attempt to shift the direction of the struggle. We say, the living problems of the people are something that the revolutionary committees need to care about and should care about. However, the revolutionary committees are not welfare departments, but command centers for class struggle. The revolutionary committees must grasp class struggle, launch a steady, accurate, and fierce attack on class enemies, implement dictatorship over class enemies, and ensure that the socialist mountains and rivers will never change color. This is the greatest concern for the working people. We must resolutely oppose counter-revolutionary economism!

Chairman Mao said: "Even after the complete annihilation of all exploiting classes on Earth, it is possible that representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek regime will still be active in various places for many years." We must always remember Chairman Mao's great teachings, never forget class struggle, grasp class struggle, and carry out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism. We must thoroughly tear apart the tattered banner of "the most important task of the state is to organize social life" and completely criticize and expose the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of Chinese Khrushchev and his ilk.

    国家的作用首先是镇压敌人
    某部副政治教导员　黄毓章
    我们的国家，是无产阶级专政的国家。我们所以要这个无产阶级专政，是因为国外有帝国主义存在，要防止国外敌人的颠覆活动和侵略；是因为国内有阶级存在，要镇压反对社会主义的反动阶级和反革命分子。只要国外还存在帝国主义，国内还存在阶级，我们国家机关的首要任务就是对付国内外的敌人，就是解决敌我之间的矛盾。可是，中国赫鲁晓夫，这个披着人皮的老狐狸、大坏蛋，却鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭”论，胡说什么“国家最重要的任务是组织社会生活。”妄图篡改国家的性质，取消无产阶级专政。
    在阶级社会里，阶级斗争是一切社会现象的总根源。在阶级消灭以前，就不会有离开阶级斗争的什么“社会生活”。党内最大的走资派和他在各地区的代理人，正是在“组织社会生活”的黑幌子下，大肆进行复辟资本主义的阴谋活动的。我在合肥支左中，耳闻目睹的大量事实完全证明了这一点。中国赫鲁晓夫在安徽省的代理人李葆华，就是这样的典型。他在农村全面推行“三自一包”，搞垮社会主义集体经济；在城市大搞“福利”、“保健”，腐蚀干部队伍。
    他们要组织的是什么“社会生活”？是彻头彻尾的资产阶级社会生活，是资产阶级对无产阶级的阶级斗争。中国赫鲁晓夫“国家最重要的任务是组织社会生活”的阴谋一旦得逞，我们国家就会改变颜色，无产阶级和劳动人民就会吃二遍苦。
    值得引起警惕的是，中国赫鲁晓夫的流毒还没有肃清。现在，当我们深入开展革命大批判的时候，不是还有人在搞反革命经济主义吗？说什么：“过去忙于搞运动，工资、住房问题不好解决，现在革命委员会成立了，是解决这些问题的时候了。”妄图转移斗争的大方向。我们说，人民群众的生活问题，革命委员会是需要关心、应该关心的。但是，革命委员会绝不是生活福利部，而是阶级斗争的指挥部。革命委员会只有抓好了阶级斗争，又稳又准又狠地向阶级敌人发动进攻，对阶级敌人实行专政，保证社会主义江山永不变色，这才是对劳动人民最大的关心。我们应当坚决反对反革命经济主义！
    毛主席说：“在地球上全部剥削阶级彻底灭亡之后多少年内，很可能还会有蒋介石王朝的代表人物在各地活动着。”我们一定要牢记毛主席的伟大教导，念念不忘阶级斗争，狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，彻底撕碎“国家最重要的任务是组织社会生活”的破烂幌子，把中国赫鲁晓夫及其反革命修正主义谬论彻底批倒批臭。
