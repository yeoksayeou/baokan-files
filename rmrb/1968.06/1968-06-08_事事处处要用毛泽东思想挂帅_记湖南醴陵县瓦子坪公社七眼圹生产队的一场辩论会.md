On the evening of April 23, the house of the Seven-Eye Pit Production Brigade in the Wazi Ping Commune of Liling County was packed with people, all engaged in a heated debate. What were they debating?

It turned out that the Seven-Eye Pit Production Brigade had sold 1,100 pounds of potato seeds at a high price, which sparked discussions among the brigade members. The majority believed: "This practice is wrong; it is harmful to others and beneficial to oneself." A minority, however, thought: "To increase the brigade's income and accumulate funds, this practice is not entirely unacceptable." The brigade's leadership saw this as a major issue involving a struggle between two ideologies and two paths, and it had to be resolved properly. Thus, they brought the issue to the masses for discussion.

At the beginning of the discussion, some people still spoke with a tone of regret: "The price of potato seeds this year is really good, but we didn't keep enough. If we had kept more, the brigade could have earned an additional sum of money!"

Most of the brigade members found these words unpleasant, believing that this way of thinking and doing things did not align with Mao Zedong Thought. In a socialist collective, one must not harm others to benefit oneself. One must emphasize Mao Zedong Thought and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Old poor peasant Zheng Wenli spoke earnestly: "In 1954, the floods were so high that the fields were submerged. The Party and the government cared for us poor and lower-middle peasants in every way, transporting tens of thousands of pounds of grain from thousands of miles away to sell to us at a fair price. They also mobilized the members of the Peach Blossom Commune to help us rebuild our homes. Without Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, how could we have such good fortune? We poor peasants are like melons on the same vine; if a sister brigade is in need and lacks potato seeds, we should raise the price? This is not the kind of conduct a poor peasant should have. I firmly oppose this practice."

Old poor peasant Zheng Wenli's words greatly enlightened everyone. However, a few members still couldn't understand, thinking that this practice was not wrong: "One is willing to buy, and the other is willing to sell, so it's not our fault!"

As soon as these words were spoken, poor peasant Zheng Shengzhou stood up and refuted: "Chairman Mao teaches us to 'fight selfishness and criticize revisionism.' I think this is a test right now! The people of Dazhai did better than us. When a sister brigade came to buy bran, they offered three fen per pound, but Dazhai said no. They offered four fen, but Dazhai still said no. They said they only had bran at six fen per pound. The style of the Dazhai people is high! We should be like the people of Dazhai, 'loving our own collective and also loving others' collectives.'"

Through this heated debate, everyone's socialist consciousness was greatly raised. They unanimously agreed to follow Chairman Mao's instructions to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," thoroughly criticize the bourgeois thoughts in their minds, and eliminate the harmful effects of the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev. Many brigade members actively exposed their selfish thoughts. Old poor peasant Zheng Wulong said: "The issue of selling potato seeds at a high price makes me feel more and more wrong. Chairman Mao teaches us: 'When we make plans, do things, and think about problems, we must start from the fact that our country has six hundred million people...' We should enthusiastically help them develop production and selflessly support them. We were wrong before, and we should correct it immediately."

At this point, a few members said: "We were wrong before, and we will definitely correct it in the future. This time, we sold it, so let it be."

As soon as this opinion was raised, it was immediately opposed by everyone. They said: "We must follow Chairman Mao's instructions: 'If mistakes are made, then correct them, the quicker and more thorough the correction, the better.' If we know we are wrong but do not correct it, then we are compounding the error! Not only must we not do such harmful things in the future, but we must also return the extra money we earned from selling potato seeds at a high price." Brigade leader Zheng Yongfu listened to everyone's speeches and received a profound ideological education. He immediately admitted to the brigade members: "The matter of selling potato seeds is because I looked at the problem from the perspective of a small collective and lost the new socialist thoughts. We must learn from the people of Dazhai, and in everything, we must be guided by Mao Zedong Thought. Before, we did not act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, which is not the fault of the comrades but my fault as the brigade leader. My bourgeois thoughts are serious, the fault is mine, and the crime is with the Chinese Khrushchev. In the future, I will study Chairman Mao's works well, listen to Chairman Mao's words, seriously fight selfishness and criticize revisionism, drive the 'selfish' character out the door, and let the 'public' character settle down."

The meeting decided to return the extra money to the buyers and make a self-criticism to them.

    事事处处要用毛泽东思想挂帅
    ——记湖南醴陵县瓦子坪公社七眼圹生产队的一场辩论会
    四月二十三日晚上，醴陵县瓦子坪公社七眼圹大队七眼圹生产队的屋子里挤满了人，大家争论得十分激烈。他们在辩论什么呢？
    原来，七眼圹生产队高价卖出薯种一千一百斤，引起了社员们的议论。多数社员认为：“这种做法不对，是损人利己的行为。”少数社员则认为：“为生产队增加收入，积累资金，这样做也未尝不可。”生产队领导班子认为：这是关系到两种思想、两条道路斗争的大问题，必须很好地解决。于是，他们便把这个问题交给群众讨论。
    讨论刚开始的时候，有的人还带有后悔的语气说：“今年的薯种价格真好，可惜留少了，多留一点，生产队还可以多增加一笔收入！”
    多数社员听了这话觉得不顺耳，认为这种思想和做法不符合毛泽东思想。社会主义的集体，决不能靠损害别人来肥自己，一定要突出毛泽东思想，按照毛主席的教导办事。老贫农钟文利语重心长地说：“一九五四年涨大水，田垄里一片汪洋，党和政府无微不至地关怀我们贫下中农，从几千里路远的外地运来几十万斤粮食，平价卖给我们。还发动桃花公社的社员，帮助我们重建家园。不是毛主席、共产党，那有这样的好事？！我们贫下中农是一根藤上结的瓜，兄弟队有困难，缺薯种，我们就高抬价格，这不是贫下中农应有的品质。我坚决反对这种做法。”老贫农钟文利的一席话，给了大家很大的教育。但还有个别社员想不通，认为这样做并不错：一个愿买，一个愿卖，这不能怪我们！
    话音刚落，贫农钟生周刷地站起来反驳说：“毛主席教导我们‘要斗私，批修’，我看眼下正是个考验！大寨人就比我们做得好，兄弟队到他们那里买糠，开口出三角一斤，大寨人说没得，又出四角，大寨人说更没得，说只有六分一斤的糠。大寨人的风格就是高！我们要象大寨人那样，‘热爱自己的集体，也要热爱别人的集体’。”
    通过这样一场激烈的争辩，大家的社会主义思想觉悟大大提高，一致表示要遵照毛主席的教导，“要斗私，批修”，彻底批判自己头脑中的资产阶级思想，肃清中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义谬论的流毒。很多社员主动地亮私斗私。老贫农钟武龙说：“高价卖薯种的问题，我越想越觉得不对头。毛主席教导我们：‘我们作计划、办事、想问题，都要从我国有六亿人口这一点出发……。’我们应当热情地帮助他们发展生产，无私地支援他们才对，以前做错了，应该马上改正。”
    可是，这时又有个别社员说：“以前做错了，今后坚决改正，这次卖了就算了。”
    这个意见一提出，马上遭到大家的反对。他们说：“我们要遵照毛主席的教导：‘犯了错误则要求改正，改正得越迅速，越彻底，越好。’如果知错不改，那就错上加错！不但以后不能做这种损人利己的事，而且要把以前高价出卖薯种多得的钱退回去。”队长钟永福听了大家的发言，受到一次深刻的思想教育。他当场向社员检讨说：“卖薯种的事，是我站在小集体看问题，丢了社会主义的新思想。我们要向大寨人学习，事事处处用毛泽东思想挂帅，以前没有按照毛主席的教导办事，这不能怪同志们，只怪我这个当队长的资产阶级思想严重，错在我，罪在中国赫鲁晓夫。今后要好好学习毛主席著作，听毛主席的话，认真斗私批修，把‘私’字扫地出门，让‘公’字安家落户。”
    会上作出了决定，把多得的钱送还买主，并向他们作自我批评。
