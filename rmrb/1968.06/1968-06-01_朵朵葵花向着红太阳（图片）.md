Every sunflower turns towards the red sun. In the great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the nurturing of the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought, the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause are growing vigorously in the struggle.

This is the fiery life of the Red Guards of Xiangchang Primary School and the children of Yuxiang Nursery in Beijing.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao!

The Red Guards are infinitely loyal to you,
It is your invincible thought,
That nurtures and arms us.
Your books, we read every day;
Your words, we listen to every sentence.
In the cause of building communism,
We pledge our loyalty to you.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao!

The Red Guards are infinitely loyal to you,
Your great and shining "May 7th Directive"
Illuminates our path forward.
Into the storm of revolution we go to temper ourselves,
Among the workers and peasants we take root,
We will not let you down,
We swear to be the successors of the revolution.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao!

The Red Guards are infinitely loyal to you,
Every sunflower turns towards the sun,
Our hearts are connected with yours.
Rain and dew make the seedlings grow strong,
Your brilliant thoughts nurture new people.
We sing of you with fervor,
Father and mother are not as dear as you.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao!

The Red Guards are infinitely loyal to you,
It is you who sent the People's Liberation Army,
To help us resume classes and make revolution.
Spread your great thoughts,
Make our eyes bright and our hearts clear.
We will study hard and improve every day,
Take over the baton and revolutionize for life.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao!

The Red Guards are infinitely loyal to you,
We have weathered storms and seen the world,
Advancing in the waves of class struggle.
We take up our pens as swords,
Sweep away all class enemies,
Overthrow the Chinese Khrushchev,
Make sure he never rises again!
