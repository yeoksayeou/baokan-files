Revolutionary workers in Hubei's railway and transportation system are vigorously grappling with class struggle to develop a great situation. The revolutionary tide surges powerfully, and vehicles and ships are busy day and night. Transportation tasks are completed better month by month, and transportation efficiency has significantly improved.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Wuhan, the revolutionary workers in Hubei Province's railway, highway, and Yangtze River navigation departments have displayed the resolute and thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat. They have vigorously exposed and criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party have been pushing in the railway and transportation departments. They have fiercely struck down and smashed the evil activities of class enemies sabotaging transportation and production. The revolutionary workers are spirited and full of fighting spirit, vigorously promoting revolution and production, and developing a great situation.

Since this year, whether on the Yangtze River's navigation lines, the railway's transportation lines, or the winding and tortuous highways extending into the mountainous areas, vehicles and ships have been busy day and night. Transportation tasks have been completed better month by month. In the past month, transportation efficiency has significantly improved. The Yangtze River navigation system's transportation volume, which has been increasing month by month, transported more than 20% additional materials in April compared to the average daily volume in the first quarter. The Wuhan Railway Bureau's loading volume and train passage volume in the first ten days of May increased by 16% and 20%, respectively, compared to the beginning of the year.

For a long time, the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads within Hubei's railway and transportation enterprises has been intense. Khrushchev and his agents, as well as traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries, have been engaged in evil activities to restore capitalism. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses in these enterprises, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and with the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist personnel, exposed the class enemies' evil activities of restoring capitalism and seized power from a handful of capitalist roaders. They also, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings, strictly distinguished between the two types of contradictions, educated and liberated the vast majority of cadres, and helped them stand up for revolution. They united the vast majority of revolutionary masses, consolidated and developed revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, and established revolutionary committees or revolutionary leading groups in one batch after another at the grassroots level. The revolutionary committees and revolutionary leading groups held high the banner of revolutionary criticism, vigorously grasped class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, continuously strengthened the revolutionary ranks, and led the revolutionary masses to launch fierce attacks on class enemies.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The hidden counter-revolutionaries who have not been eliminated will not give up. They will definitely take the opportunity to cause trouble. The American imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek clique often send spies here to carry out sabotage activities. Even if the original counter-revolutionaries are eliminated, new counter-revolutionaries may appear. If we lose vigilance, we will be badly deceived and suffer heavy losses." The revolutionary workers firmly remember Chairman Mao's great teachings, heightened their revolutionary vigilance, and always paid attention to the new trends, new characteristics, and new problems of class struggle. They timely exposed the class enemies' plots to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and production, and exposed the hidden counter-revolutionaries. They resolutely opposed right-opportunism, right-sectarianism, and right-capitulationism, and smashed the class enemies' attempts to reverse the verdict.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Class struggle, once grasped, is effective." The revolutionary criticism has severely struck the class enemies, armed the revolutionary masses, promoted the widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought, and brought about a great change in the spiritual outlook of the revolutionary workers. They, with the resolute and thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," did a good job in transportation and communication work, and promoted continuous production development. Revolutionary workers, in the struggle to launch fierce attacks on the enemies of the proletariat, insisted on holding various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and launched a wave of learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought extensively.

    湖北铁路交通系统革命职工狠抓阶级斗争发展大好形势
    革命洪流汹涌澎湃  车辆船舶日夜奔忙
    运输任务一月比一月完成得好，运输效率也有显著提高
    据新华社武汉电　湖北省铁路、公路系统和长江航运部门的广大革命职工，发扬无产阶级坚决彻底的革命精神，狠揭猛批中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派在铁路交通部门推行的反革命修正主义路线，猛烈打击和粉碎了阶级敌人破坏运输生产的罪恶活动。广大革命职工精神振奋，斗志昂扬，狠抓革命，猛促生产，发展了大好形势。
    今年以来，湖北省无论在长江的航运线上，铁路的运输线上，还是在伸向山区的蜿蜒曲折的公路线上，车辆、船舶日夜奔忙，运输任务一月比一月完成得好。近一个月来，运输效率有显著提高。长江航运系统的运输量在月月上升的情况下，四月份比第一季度平均每天多运百分之二十以上的物资。武汉铁路分局五月上旬的装车量和列车通过量分别比年初提高了百分之十六和百分之二十。
    长期以来，湖北境内的铁路、交通企业中，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争十分激烈。中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人，以及叛徒、特务和反革命分子等，进行着复辟资本主义的罪恶活动。在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，这些企业的无产阶级革命派，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在人民解放军支左人员的帮助下，揭露了阶级敌人复辟资本主义的罪恶活动，并夺了一小撮走资派的权。他们还遵照毛主席的教导，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，教育和解放了绝大多数干部，帮助他们站出来革命；团结了绝大多数革命群众，巩固和发展了革命大联合和革命三结合，一批又一批的基层单位建立了革命委员会或革命领导小组。革命委员会和革命领导小组高举革命批判的大旗，狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争，不断壮大革命队伍，带领广大革命群众继续向阶级敌人主动地发动猛烈进攻。
    毛主席教导我们：“没有肃清的暗藏的反革命分子是不会死心的，他们必定要乘机捣乱。美帝国主义者和蒋介石集团经常还在派遣特务到我们这里来进行破坏活动。原有的反革命分子肃清了，还可能出现一些新的反革命分子。如果我们丧失警惕性，那就会上大当，吃大亏。”广大革命职工牢记毛主席的这一伟大教导，提高了革命警惕性，时刻注意阶级斗争的新动向、新特点、新问题，及时识破阶级敌人破坏无产阶级文化大革命、破坏生产的阴谋，并揪出了暗藏的反革命分子。他们坚决反对右倾机会主义、右倾分裂主义、右倾投降主义，粉碎了阶级敌人刮起的翻案妖风。
    毛主席教导我们：“阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”革命的大批判，沉重地打击了阶级敌人，武装了革命群众，促进了毛泽东思想的大普及，广大革命职工的精神面貌发生了巨大变化。他们以无产阶级坚决彻底的革命精神，坚决执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，搞好交通运输工作，推动生产不断发展。革命职工在向无产阶级的敌人发动猛烈进攻的斗争中，坚持大办办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，掀起了大学大用毛泽东思想的热潮。
