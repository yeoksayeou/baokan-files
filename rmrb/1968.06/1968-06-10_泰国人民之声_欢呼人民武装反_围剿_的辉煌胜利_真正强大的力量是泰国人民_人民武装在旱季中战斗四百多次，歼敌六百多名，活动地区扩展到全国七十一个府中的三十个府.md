"The Voice of the Thai People" radio station issued a commentary on June 7, enthusiastically celebrating the glorious victory of the Thai people's armed forces, led by the Communist Party of Thailand, in repelling the counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" by the U.S.-Thanom reactionary clique during the dry season.

The commentary pointed out that the glorious victory achieved by the Thai people's armed forces once again proved the correctness of Chairman Mao's assertion that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. It showed that the U.S.-Thai reactionaries are nothing but paper tigers, with no formidable power, while the true strength lies with the Thai people.

The commentary stated that the U.S.-Thai reactionaries were extremely alarmed by the rapid development and growth of the Thai people's armed forces led by the Communist Party of Thailand. They resorted to every possible means to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the Thai people. From last November to this May, the Thanom-Baiboon traitorous clique, under the orders of U.S. imperialism, mobilized over 60,000 military and police personnel, using tanks, artillery, aircraft, and other modern weapons provided by U.S. imperialism, to launch a frenzied counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" against the people's armed forces.

The commentary said that the Thai people's armed forces, following the teachings of the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, fought tenaciously against the enemy. They understood that only by annihilating a large number of the enemy's forces could they thoroughly smash the enemy's counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression," preserve and develop the strength of the people, and expand the areas of operation of the people's armed forces.

The commentary said that the Thai people's armed forces employed the strategies and tactics of people's war, striking the enemy flexibly and mobilely. Preliminary statistics show that from last November to this May, the people's armed forces engaged in over 400 battles against the enemy during the dry season "encirclement and suppression," annihilating over 600 enemy personnel, shooting down and damaging eight enemy aircraft, destroying and damaging numerous military vehicles, and seizing a batch of weapons, thus smashing the enemy's dry season "encirclement and suppression."

The commentary said that in the battle to repel the enemy's counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression," the Thai people's armed forces dealt heavy blows to the enemy and continuously grew stronger. In this round of repelling the enemy's dry season "encirclement and suppression," the people's armed forces opened up new operational areas in more than ten counties in several other provinces. Today, the operational areas of the Thai people's armed forces have expanded to 30 out of the 71 provinces and more than 100 counties nationwide. The Thai revolution is showing a thriving and prosperous situation.

The commentary said that the victory of the Thai people's armed forces greatly encouraged the Thai revolutionary people who are fighting to expel the American aggressors and overthrow the Thanom-Baiboon traitorous clique. It made the Thai people more firmly believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, by persisting in the people's revolutionary armed struggle, they will definitely achieve the final victory and realize the thorough liberation of the nation and the people.

    “泰国人民之声”欢呼人民武装反“围剿”的辉煌胜利
    真正强大的力量是泰国人民
    人民武装在旱季中战斗四百多次，歼敌六百多名，活动地区扩展到全国七十一个府中的三十个府
    新华社八日讯　“泰国人民之声”电台七日发表评论，热烈欢呼泰国共产党领导下的泰国人民武装，取得了粉碎美国—他侬反动集团的旱季反革命“围剿”的辉煌胜利。
    评论指出，泰国人民武装取得的这一辉煌胜利，再一次证明了毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的英明论断，证明美泰反动派的本质是纸老虎，并没有什么了不起的力量，真正强大的力量是泰国人民。
    评论说，美泰反动派对泰国共产党领导下的泰国人民武装迅速发展壮大，感到非常恐慌，它们千方百计地企图扑灭泰国人民的革命烈火。从去年十一月到今年五月，他侬—巴博卖国集团在美帝国主义的指使下，出动了六万多军警，动用美帝国主义提供的坦克、大炮、飞机等现代化武器，对人民武装发动了疯狂的反革命“围剿”。
    评论说，泰国人民武装遵照世界革命人民的伟大导师毛主席的教导，同敌人进行了顽强的战斗。他们认识到，只有大量消灭敌人的有生力量，才能够彻底粉碎敌人的反革命“围剿”，保存和发展壮大人民的力量，才能够扩大人民武装活动地区。
    评论说，泰国人民武装运用了人民战争的战略战术，机动灵活地打击敌人。据初步统计，从去年十一月至今年五月，人民武装在反击敌人旱季“围剿”战斗中，同敌人战斗四百多次，歼灭敌人六百多名，击落击伤敌机八架，击毁击坏军车多辆，缴获一批武器，粉碎了敌人的旱季“围剿”。
    评论说，泰国人民武装在粉碎敌人反革命“围剿”的战斗中，沉重地打击敌人，不断地壮大自己。在这次反击敌人旱季“围剿”战斗中，人民武装又在另几个府的十多个县中，开辟了新的活动地区。今天，泰国人民武装活动地区，已扩展到全国七十一个府中的三十个府一百多个县。泰国革命呈现一片蓬勃发展的大好形势。
  评论说，泰国人民武装的胜利，大大地鼓舞了为驱逐美国侵略者和推翻他侬—巴博卖国集团而战斗的泰国革命人民，使泰国人民更加坚信：在泰国共产党领导下，坚持人民革命武装斗争，就一定能够取得最后胜利，实现民族和人民的彻底解放。
