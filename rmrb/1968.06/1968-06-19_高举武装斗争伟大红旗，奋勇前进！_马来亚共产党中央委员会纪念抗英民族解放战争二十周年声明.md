Hold High the Great Red Banner of Armed Struggle, Advance Bravely!
—Malayan Communist Party Central Committee Statement Commemorating the 20th Anniversary of the Anti-British National Liberation War

	June 1, 1968

On the evening of June 20, 1948, British imperialism launched a sudden attack on the people of Malaya, conducting nationwide arrests in an attempt to annihilate the revolutionary forces centered around the Malayan Communist Party. However, this vicious plot of the enemy met with a humiliating failure. The Malayan Communist Party had made the necessary preparations in terms of ideology and organization. When the enemy implemented comprehensive suppression, the party resolutely led the people of all ethnic groups to take up arms, using revolutionary violence to counter the enemy's counter-revolutionary violence, and embarked on the path of surrounding the cities from the countryside and seizing political power through armed struggle. The Malayan national democratic revolution thus entered a new historical period.

Over the past twenty years, the armed struggle of the Malayan people has gone through a glorious course. Under the prolonged and ferocious attacks of the cunning and brutal British imperialism, the Malayan Communist Party and the Malayan National Liberation Army it leads have fought tenaciously and bravely. Despite suffering heavy losses, our party and our army have not only not been annihilated but are growing stronger. The red flag of armed struggle continues to fly high. This is a great victory for the people of Malaya, a great victory for Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

Under the heavy blows of the prolonged armed struggle, British imperialism's more than a hundred years of colonial rule in Malaya has been fundamentally shaken. It has repeatedly changed its methods of rule, even colluding with American imperialism and the Soviet revisionist clique to concoct the so-called "Federation of Malaysia" and "Republic of Singapore," in an attempt to stave off the inevitable collapse of its colonial rule.

Over the past twenty years, the armed struggle of the Malayan people has gone through a tortuous and arduous journey. The revolutionary people have been tempered and tested in this prolonged and fierce struggle. The Malayan Communist Party has drawn many important lessons from the advances and setbacks of this period of struggle. The main lesson is that the path of surrounding the cities from the countryside and seizing political power through armed struggle must be adhered to under all circumstances.

Experience has proven that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," and "without an army of the people, there is nothing." This is an unshakable truth. Imperialism and its lackeys, the Rahman-Lee Kuan Yew clique, rely on the gun to maintain their reactionary rule and brutally oppress the people. Their cries of "one person, one vote," "parliamentary democracy," "socialism," and so on, are all cunning deceptions. Only by taking up arms and waging people's war can their bloody rule be overthrown. Only by thoroughly smashing their reactionary state machine and establishing a people's government can we talk about achieving socialism.

Experience has proven that armed struggle is the main form of struggle, and the army is the main form of organization. All other mass organizations and mass struggles must directly or indirectly support armed struggle. Therefore, the focus of revolutionary work must be on rural areas. We must consolidate and develop rural base areas.

Experience has proven that only by mobilizing and relying on the masses can armed struggle be sustained and developed. We must propagate, organize, and arm the masses. As long as the broad masses, especially the agricultural workers, peasants, and other laboring people in rural areas, are fully mobilized, a powerful force to defeat the enemy can be formed. To mobilize the masses, we must adhere to the mass line, actively lead the broad masses in political and economic struggles, and gradually raise the political consciousness of the masses in the struggle, leading them forward.

Experience has proven that "the united front is a united front for waging armed struggle." Without armed struggle, there can be no genuine anti-imperialist united front. Only by holding high the red flag of armed struggle can we consolidate and expand the national democratic united front led by the working class (through the Communist Party), based on the worker-peasant alliance, uniting the petty bourgeoisie, national bourgeoisie, and all anti-imperialist patriots. The Communist Party must maintain its independence in ideology, politics, and organization within the united front and uphold its leadership.

Experience has proven that only by adhering to the policy of national unity on the basis of national equality and resolutely opposing the colonialists' and domestic reactionaries' policies of national division and racism can the workers and peasants of all nationalities be broadly mobilized, and the great unity of the people of all nationalities be consolidated and developed.

Experience has proven that the Malayan Communist Party is the only true vanguard of the Malayan working class and the faithful defender of the interests of the people of all nationalities. The Malayan Communist Party is a revolutionary party armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, tempered by long years of struggle. Only it dares to lead the Malayan people in waging a prolonged armed struggle under extremely arduous conditions. Only under its leadership can the Malayan revolution be victorious.

Ultimately, twenty years of armed struggle practice have proven that contemporary Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought—is the guiding light of the Malayan revolution. Combining the universal truths of Mao Zedong Thought with the specific practice of the Malayan revolution is the sole guarantee of the victory of the armed struggle of the Malayan people.

The current international situation is excellent. Socialist China has become the center and base of the world revolution. The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has entered the stage of achieving comprehensive victory, and the dictatorship of the proletariat has been further consolidated. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is spreading widely, promoting the deep development of the world revolution, and tolling the death knell for imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries. The great achievements of the Albanian people in their revolutionary movement, the great victories of the Vietnamese people in their war against American aggression for national salvation, the flourishing armed struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the new storm of the struggle against violence by American blacks, the new upsurge of the revolutionary struggles of the proletariat and progressive forces in Western Europe and North America, especially the great storm stirred up by the workers, students, and the broad masses in France, the increasingly severe political and economic crises of the imperialist system, and the disintegration of the revisionist clique—all these indicate that imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries are approaching their doom.

The situation at home is also excellent. British imperialism is on the verge of collapse. American imperialism and its lackeys are taking advantage of the situation to intensify their infiltration and actively plot new military alliances. The Soviet revisionist clique, in collusion with imperialism, is sabotaging our people's revolutionary struggle. The Rahman-Lee Kuan Yew puppet clique, representing the comprador bourgeoisie and landlord class, in accordance with the wishes of their imperialist masters, is frantically expanding the military and intensifying its anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-China policies. They are carrying out even more barbaric political persecution and more brutal economic exploitation of the broad masses. Currency devaluation, sharp drops in rubber prices, soaring prices of necessities, and heavy taxes—all these are causing the laboring masses to become increasingly impoverished, and unemployment and school dropouts are increasing. The contradictions between the broad masses and imperialism, the Soviet revisionist clique, and the Rahman-Lee Kuan Yew puppet clique are becoming increasingly sharp. Under the inspiration of our party and army's victorious persistence in armed struggle, the waves of struggle by workers, peasants, fishermen, students, and other strata of people against persecution, for genuine independence, and for improved living conditions are surging higher and higher. All this indicates that a new revolutionary storm is bound to come.

The current task of the people of all nationalities in Malaya is to unite, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, strengthen the struggle from all sides, especially armed struggle, launch a sustained and fierce offensive against the enemy, and strive to overthrow British and American imperialism and their lackey, the Rahman-Lee Kuan Yew clique, to achieve a truly independent, unified, and democratic Malaya.

Now the world has entered a new era under the banner of the great Mao Zedong Thought. Under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, the people of the world are launching a general offensive against the old world. The heroic people of Malaya and all the fighters of the Malayan National Liberation Army, under the leadership of the Malayan Communist Party, are holding high the great red banner of armed struggle and advancing bravely. Although we will encounter difficulties and obstacles on the road ahead, we are firmly convinced that under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, we will surely achieve the final victory.

Down with imperialism headed by the United States!
Down with modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist clique!
Down with the Rahman-Lee Kuan Yew puppet clique!
The armed struggle of the Malayan people will be victorious!
Long live the great unity of the revolutionary people of all nationalities in Malaya!
Long live the heroic Malayan National Liberation Army! Long live the glorious Malayan Communist Party! Long live the invincible Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the great teacher and great leader of all the people of the world, Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!

    ——马来亚共产党中央委员会纪念抗英民族解放战争二十周年声明
                          一九六八年六月一日
    一九四八年六月二十日晚上，英帝国主义向马来亚人民发动了突然袭击，在全国范围进行大搜捕，妄图一举扑灭以马来亚共产党为核心的革命力量。可是，敌人这一恶毒阴谋遭到了可耻的失败。马来亚共产党在思想上和组织上作好了必要的准备，在敌人实行全面镇压时，毅然领导各族人民拿起武器，以革命的暴力还击反革命的暴力，走上了乡村包围城市、武装夺取政权的道路。马来亚民族民主革命从此进入了一个新的历史时期。
    二十年来，马来亚人民武装斗争经历了光荣的历程。在凶恶奸猾的英帝国主义的长期疯狂进攻底下，马来亚共产党和它所领导的马来亚民族解放军进行了英勇顽强的战斗。尽管曾经遭受过严重损失，我党我军不但没有被消灭，而且正在发展壮大。武装斗争红旗始终凌空飘扬。这是马来亚人民的伟大胜利，是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    在长期武装斗争的沉重打击下，英帝国主义在马来亚一百多年的殖民统治从根本上动摇了。它一再改变统治方式，甚至勾结美帝国主义和苏修叛徒集团炮制所谓“马来西亚联邦”和“新加坡共和国”，企图挽救其殖民统治的不可避免的崩溃。
    二十年来，马来亚人民武装斗争走过了艰苦曲折的道路。革命的人民在这长期激烈的斗争中经受了考验和锻炼。马来亚共产党从这一时期的斗争的前进和后退中，取得了许多重要的经验教训。主要的是，必须在任何情况下坚持乡村包围城市、武装夺取政权的道路。
    经验证明，“枪杆子里面出政权”，“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切”，是颠扑不破的伟大真理。帝国主义及其走狗拉赫曼李光耀集团是靠枪杆子来维持其反动政权，对人民实行残暴压迫的。它们叫嚷什么“一人一票”、“议会民主”、“社会主义”等等，全是阴险的骗局。只有拿起枪杆子，进行人民战争，才能推翻它们的血腥统治。只有彻底打碎它们的反动国家机器，建立人民政权，才谈得上实现社会主义。
    经验证明，武装斗争是主要的斗争形式，军队是主要的组织形式，其他一切的群众组织和群众斗争，都必须直接或间接地配合武装斗争。因此，革命工作的重心必须放在乡村地区。必须巩固和发展乡村根据地。
    经验证明，只有动员和依靠群众才能坚持和发展武装斗争。必须宣传、组织和武装群众。只要把广大群众，特别是乡村地区的农业工人、农民和其他劳动群众充分发动起来，就能形成战胜敌人的强大力量。要发动群众，就必须坚持群众路线，积极领导广大群众进行政治斗争和经济斗争，并且在斗争中逐步提高群众的政治觉悟，率领群众前进。
    经验证明，“统一战线，是实行武装斗争的统一战线”。离开了武装斗争，就不可能有任何真正的反帝统一战线。只有高举武装斗争红旗，才能巩固和扩大工人阶级（经过共产党）领导的、工农联盟为基础的、联合小资产阶级、民族资产阶级和一切反帝爱国人士的民族民主统一战线。共产党在统一战线中必须坚持思想上、政治上和组织上的独立性，坚持领导权。
    经验证明，只有坚持在民族平等基础上的民族团结政策，坚决反对殖民主义者和国内反动派的民族分化和种族主义政策，才能把各民族工农群众广泛发动起来，巩固和发展各民族人民的革命大团结。
    经验证明，马来亚共产党是马来亚工人阶级唯一真正的先锋队，是各民族人民利益的忠实捍卫者。马来亚共产党是用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的久经考验的革命党。只有它才敢于领导马来亚人民在极端艰苦的条件下自力更生地进行长期的武装斗争。只有它的领导，马来亚革命才能胜利。
    归根到底，二十年的武装斗争实践证明，当代的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想是马来亚革命的指针，把毛泽东思想的普遍真理同马来亚革命的具体实践结合起来，是马来亚人民武装斗争取得胜利的唯一保证。
    当前的国际形势大好。社会主义的中国已经成为世界革命的中心和根据地。史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命已经进入了夺取全面胜利的阶段，无产阶级专政已经更加巩固。战无不胜的毛泽东思想的广泛传播，推动了世界革命的深入发展，敲响了帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的丧钟。阿尔巴尼亚人民在革命化运动中取得的重大成就，越南人民抗美救国战争的伟大胜利，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民武装斗争的蓬勃发展，美国黑人抗暴斗争的新风暴，西欧和北美无产阶级和进步力量的革命斗争的新高涨，特别是法国工人、学生和广大群众掀起的伟大风暴，帝国主义体系的政治经济危机的日益严重，修正主义集团的分崩离析，这一切表明帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派正日益接近灭亡。
    我们国内也是一片大好形势。英帝国主义已经日暮途穷。美帝国主义及其仆从趁机加紧渗入，并且积极策划拼凑新的军事联盟。苏修叛徒集团伙同帝国主义破坏我国人民革命斗争。代表买办资产阶级和地主阶级的拉赫曼李光耀傀儡集团秉承其帝国主义主子的意旨，疯狂扩军备战，变本加厉实行反共、反人民、反中国的政策。它们对广大人民在政治上进行更加野蛮的迫害，在经济上实行更加残酷的剥削。货币贬值，胶价猛降，生活必需品价格飞涨，苛捐杂税繁重。劳动群众日益贫困，失业失学不断增加。广大人民同帝国主义、苏修叛徒集团以及拉赫曼李光耀傀儡集团之间的矛盾，越来越尖锐。在我党我军胜利坚持武装斗争的鼓舞下，工人、农民、渔民、学生以及其他阶层人民反对迫害、要求实现真正独立、要求改善生活的斗争浪潮日益高涨。这一切表明新的革命风暴必将来临。
    马来亚各族人民当前的任务是：团结起来，发扬敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命精神，从各个方面加强斗争，特别是武装斗争，向敌人发动持久的猛烈的进攻，为打倒英美帝国主义及其走狗拉赫曼李光耀集团，实现一个真正独立、统一、民主的马来亚而奋斗到底。
    现在世界已经进入了以伟大的毛泽东思想为旗帜的新时代。全世界人民在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下正向旧世界发动总攻击。英雄的马来亚人民和马来亚民族解放军全体指战员在马来亚共产党的领导下，高举武装斗争伟大红旗，继续奋勇前进。尽管在前进的道路上还会遇到困难和障碍，但是，我们坚信，在伟大的毛泽东思想的指引下，我们一定能够取得最后的胜利。
    打倒以美国为首的帝国主义！
    打倒以苏修叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义！
    打倒拉赫曼李光耀傀儡集团！
    马来亚人民武装斗争必胜！
    马来亚各民族人民的革命大团结万岁！
    英雄的马来亚民族解放军万岁！光荣的马来亚共产党万岁！战无不胜的马克思列宁主义，毛泽东思想万岁！全世界人民的伟大导师、伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
