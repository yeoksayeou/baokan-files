The patriotic military and civilian forces of Xam Neua Province in Laos have fully demonstrated their spirit of brave combat, achieving significant victories in the first six months of the 1967-1968 dry season by launching continuous offensives.

According to incomplete statistics, the patriotic military and civilian forces of Xam Neua Province engaged in 176 battles during this period, annihilating 2,860 enemy troops, including more than 20 American aggressors. They shot down 20 American warplanes and seized over 1,600 pieces of various weapons.

It is particularly noteworthy that during these six months of combat, the patriotic military and civilian forces of Xam Neua Province annihilated many enemy units, including the complete destruction of three battalions and the severe mauling of five battalions. In the battle to recapture Baty, they annihilated over 500 enemy troops in a single engagement.

Additionally, the patriotic military and civilian forces of Xam Neua Province destroyed many enemy strongholds and command centers, liberating 18 villages with a total population of 18,300.

The Pathet Lao radio station commented on this great victory, stating that the brilliant achievements of Xam Neua Province's patriotic military and civilian forces in the dry season are a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. If U.S. imperialism and its lackeys continue to stubbornly invade the liberated areas, they will be thoroughly annihilated by the patriotic military and civilian forces of Laos.

According to a report from the Pathet Lao News Agency, the patriotic armed forces of Udomsai Province thwarted various "eating away" attacks by rightist troops on the liberated areas in the first four months of this year, annihilating many bands of bandits and special forces.

According to incomplete statistics, the patriotic armed forces of this province annihilated 758 enemy troops in 119 battles, seizing 450 pieces of weapons, 15 tons of ammunition, and a large amount of other military equipment.

The patriotic armed forces also launched multiple attacks on various transportation lines, sinking 10 enemy military vessels and damaging 12 others in the Mekong River. Additionally, they shot down one American aircraft.

In the face of severe defeats, one company of the rightist troops mutinied and surrendered to the people with their weapons.

According to a report from the Pathet Lao News Agency, the local troops and guerrillas of Savannakhet Province, from May 10 to 12, consecutively ambushed American-sponsored bandits and special forces on the 9th Highway and the Phalan region, killing and wounding 53 enemy troops.

    发扬勇敢战斗精神　连续出击狠揍敌人
    老挝桑怒省爱国军民旱季歼敌近三千
    新华社康开电　据巴特寮电台广播：老挝桑怒省爱国军民大力发扬勇敢战斗精神，在一九六七——一九六八年旱季的头六个月中，连续出击，赢得了重大战果。
    据不完全统计，桑怒省爱国军民在这期间共战斗一百七十六次，歼灭敌人二千八百六十名，其中有美国侵略者二十多名，击落美国强盗飞机二十架，缴获各种武器一千六百多件。
    特别值得提出的是，在这六个月的战斗中，桑怒省爱国军民成营成连地歼灭了敌人的许多建制单位，其中包括全歼三个营和重创五个营。仅在收复巴堤的战斗中，一次就歼敌五百多名。
    此外，桑怒省爱国军民还摧毁了敌人的许多巢穴和指挥部，收复了拥有一万八千三百多居民的十八个乡。
    巴特寮电台就这一重大胜利发表的评论指出，桑怒省爱国军民旱季所取得的辉煌战果，是对美帝国主义及其走狗的当头一棒。如果美帝国主义及其走狗继续顽固地侵犯解放区，必将被老挝爱国军民彻底消灭。
    新华社康开电　据巴特寮通讯社报道：乌多姆塞省的爱国武装力量，在今年头四个月中粉碎了右派军队对解放区的各次“蚕食”进攻，歼灭了许多股匪徒和别动队。
    据不完全统计，这个省的爱国武装力量在一百一十九次战斗中，共歼灭敌人七百五十八名，缴获武器四百五十多件、十五吨弹药和大批其他军事装备。
    爱国武装力量还对各条交通线多次发动袭击，在湄公河上击沉敌人军用船只十艘，击伤十二艘。此外，还击落美国飞机一架。
    这个地区的右派军队在遭到严重失败的情况下，有一个连进行兵变，携械向人民投诚。
    据新华社康开电　据巴特寮通讯社报道：老挝沙湾拿吉省的地方部队和游击队，从五月十日到十二日为止的三天中，在九号公路和法兰地区接连截击美国豢养的土匪和别动队，打死打伤敌人五十三人。
