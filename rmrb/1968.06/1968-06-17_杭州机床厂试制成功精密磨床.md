Hangzhou Machine Tool Factory's revolutionary rebels and revolutionary workers, with a spirit of daring to think, daring to do, and daring to make revolution, have successfully designed and trialed a precision horizontal table surface grinder under conditions of limited experience and poor equipment. This grinder, which plays a significant role in the manufacturing of instruments, meters, and tools, is now in full production.

The precision horizontal table surface grinder is used for machining high-precision, high-surface-finish components. After being appraised by relevant departments, it was found that the precision of components machined by the grinder trialed by Hangzhou Machine Tool Factory has reached an internationally advanced level. This product, when exhibited at the 1968 Spring China Export Commodities Fair in Guangzhou, was warmly received and highly praised.

    杭州机床厂试制成功精密磨床
    杭州机床厂无产阶级革命派和革命职工发扬敢想、敢干、敢革命的精神，在经验缺乏、设备条件差的情况下，自行设计试制成功在仪器、仪表、工具制造等方面占有相当重要地位的精密卧轴矩台平面磨床，并已正式生产。
    精密卧轴矩台平面磨床，是用来加工高精度、高光洁度的机件的。经有关部门鉴定，杭州机床厂试制成功的这种磨床加工机件的精密程度，达到了国际先进水平。这个产品在广州举行的一九六八年春季中国出口商品交易会上展出时，受到热烈赞扬和高度评价。
