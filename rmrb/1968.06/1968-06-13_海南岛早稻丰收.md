Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," Hainan Island's early rice production this year has again achieved a bumper harvest. Many places have increased production significantly on the basis of last year's bumper harvest. The various levels of revolutionary committees are leading the broad revolutionary masses to firmly grasp class struggle, and to carry out a sustained and in-depth revolutionary criticism, vigorously promoting summer harvesting and planting. In counties like Wanning and Lingshui, where the season is relatively early, after basically completing the summer harvesting tasks, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres actively engaged in late-season production, launching a high tide of fertilizing, plowing, and transplanting.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the broad revolutionary people under its leadership and the Kuomintang reactionaries. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." The various levels of revolutionary committees in Hainan Island have seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, deeply recognizing that the closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution comes to complete victory, the more frantically the class enemies will struggle. The busier production is, the more we must grasp class struggle, and strike hard at the class enemies to defend the rich fruits of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The county and commune revolutionary committees have dispatched a large number of revolutionary cadres to the summer harvesting front lines, setting up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and together with the broad poor and lower-middle peasants studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They have mobilized the broad revolutionary masses, united all revolutionary forces that can be united, and carried out a sustained and in-depth revolutionary criticism, striking accurately and forcefully at a handful of class enemies. Through firmly grasping class struggle and carrying out a sustained and in-depth revolutionary criticism, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have smashed the class enemies' evil plots to disrupt the summer harvest, further implementing the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions on "each year we must firmly grasp the three tasks of harvesting, storage, and consumption (harvest, store, eat)." This has made this year's summer harvest in Hainan Island not only fast in progress but also high in quality.

    海南岛早稻丰收
    据新华社海口十二日电　在伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针指引下，海南岛今年的早稻生产又获得丰收，许多地方在去年大丰收的基础上又有显著增产。各级革命委员会正带领广大革命群众狠抓阶级斗争，持久深入地开展革命大批判，猛促夏收夏种。季节较早的万宁、陵水等县在基本结束夏收任务后，广大贫下中农和革命干部积极投入了晚造生产，掀起了备肥、犁田、插秧高潮。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”海南岛各级革命委员会认真学习了毛主席的最新指示，深刻地认识到：无产阶级文化大革命越接近全面胜利，阶级敌人越要疯狂挣扎。生产越忙，越要抓阶级斗争，狠狠打击阶级敌人，保卫无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果。各县、社革命委员会派出了大批革命干部奔赴夏收第一线，大办毛泽东思想学习班，同广大贫下中农一起学习毛主席的最新指示，放手发动广大革命群众，团结一切可以团结的革命力量，持久深入地开展革命大批判，稳、准、狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人。通过狠抓阶级斗争和持久深入地开展革命大批判，广大贫下中农和革命干部粉碎了阶级敌人破坏夏收的罪恶阴谋，进一步落实了伟大领袖毛主席关于“每年一定要把收割、保管、吃用三件事（收、管、吃）抓得很紧很紧”的指示，使今年海南岛的夏收不仅进度快，而且质量高。
