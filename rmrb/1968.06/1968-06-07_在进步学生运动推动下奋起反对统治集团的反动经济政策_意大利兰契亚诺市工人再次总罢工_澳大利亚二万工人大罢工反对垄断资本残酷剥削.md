	Inspired by the progressive student movement, workers in Lanciano, Italy, and Australia have risen up to oppose the reactionary economic policies of the ruling class.

	Workers in Lanciano Stage Second Strike in a Week

	ROME, June 5 — Workers in the southern Italian city of Lanciano, driven by the progressive student movement, staged their second general strike in a week on June 4. The strike was a protest against the ruling class's economic policies that target the working people.

	On the morning of June 4, a crowd of 10,000 strikers and citizens clashed bravely with police who had come to suppress the demonstration. The reactionary police used tear gas, batons, and chains to attack the demonstrators. Led by young students and workers, the demonstrators defended themselves with stones and sticks, and bravely threw back the tear gas canisters hurled at them by the police. The demonstrators also pushed cars onto the streets to create barricades and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the police. The intense battle lasted for about two hours. That evening, the demonstrators clashed with the police again.

	In Naples, workers and employees of a public utility held a demonstration to protest against the management's refusal to pay wages.

	In Palermo, the capital of the Sicilian autonomous region, striking workers have been engaged in fierce battles with the police over the past few days. Due to the workers' strike, all public services in the city have come to a complete halt.
