Revolutionary committees at all levels across the country, along with hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses, have launched a massive campaign to study the example of Comrade Men Hengzhi, a good cadre who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Members of revolutionary committees at all levels have expressed that they will definitely combine this significant learning activity with the current situation and tasks of class struggle, to drive the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses forward to victory.

New China News Agency, June 9th: Revolutionary committee members at all levels in provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country have responded resolutely to the great call from the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, and together with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses, have launched a massive campaign to learn from Comrade Men Hengzhi, a good cadre who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Members of revolutionary committees at all levels have expressed that they will definitely combine this significant learning activity with the current situation and tasks of class struggle, to drive the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to better follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, to adhere to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, to further implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and to achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Members of revolutionary committees at all levels also expressed that they will definitely take Comrade Men Hengzhi, a great communist warrior, as an example, and in the storms of struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, temper themselves into steadfast revolutionary warriors who are infinitely loyal to the people, the Party, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They will build revolutionary committees at all levels into revolutionary command headquarters that hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize proletarian politics, and closely connect with the masses.

Since the order to posthumously award Comrade Men Hengzhi with an honorable title was approved by the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, members of revolutionary committees at all levels in provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have taken the lead in launching a campaign to learn from Comrade Men Hengzhi. Many provincial, municipal, and autonomous region revolutionary committees have held consecutive standing committee meetings to seriously study Comrade Men Hengzhi's brilliant deeds. Many provincial, municipal, and autonomous region revolutionary committees have specially organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes to learn from Comrade Men Hengzhi's advanced deeds. Many members of revolutionary committees at all levels in various regions have been learning while taking action, carrying their bags, and going deep into the masses to implement the central command, propagate Comrade Men Hengzhi's revolutionary spirit and heroic deeds. The standing committee of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee recently held three special meetings to learn from Comrade Men Hengzhi, deciding to immediately organize study classes to gather all county-level and above revolutionary committee members for a two-week study, using Comrade Men Hengzhi as a shining example to promote the current struggle and the revolutionary construction of revolutionary committees at all levels. Members of the Xuancheng County Revolutionary Committee in Hebei Province, after learning from Comrade Men Hengzhi's brilliant deeds of defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, further raised their awareness of class struggle and line struggle, leading more than 2,000 revolutionary cadres at the county and commune levels to carry their luggage, go deep into the production teams, and together with poor and lower-middle peasants, organize various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, carry out in-depth revolutionary criticism, and launch a more fierce attack on the class enemies. Members of the revolutionary committee in Mao Zedong's hometown, Shaoshan Commune, inspired by Comrade Men Hengzhi's brilliant deeds, led the broad revolutionary masses and Red Guards to solemnly pledge in front of Mao Zedong's former residence: to forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, to always stand guard and fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "It is either the east wind prevailing over the west wind or the west wind prevailing over the east wind. There is no room for compromise on the line issue." Members of revolutionary committees at all levels have further realized through learning that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is our lifeline and the fundamental guarantee of revolutionary victory.

Members of revolutionary committees in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, and Gansu provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have all pointed out in their studies that adhering to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line will enable our country to advance on the great road to socialism and communism, and the proletariat and working people will have everything; without Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, our Party and state will change color, and the proletariat and working people will lose everything. We must lead the broad revolutionary masses to carry out a sustained and in-depth revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize and expose the reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev, expose hidden traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries, resolutely smash the rightist reversal wind stirred up by the class enemies, and let Chairman Mao's revolutionary line forever guide us to victory. Many places have organized special meetings to examine their own awareness in implementing and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and have decided to always adhere to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and strive to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line for life. Leaders of the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee said that we must be like Comrade Men Hengzhi, regarding being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line as our first life, and regarding firmly implementing and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line as our lifelong sacred duty. Leaders of the Zhejiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee expressed that we will learn from Comrade Men Hengzhi to regard defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line as our most fundamental revolutionary principle, to consciously defend it, to thoroughly defend it, and to defend it to the death. Members of the Jiangxi and Hebei Provincial Revolutionary Committees pointed out that loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the dividing line between revolution and non-revolution. We must learn from Comrade Men Hengzhi, ignite a revolution in our souls, thoroughly transform our worldview, and be good warriors who firmly defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line for life.

Vice Chairman Lin instructed us: "The attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is a very important issue. We must grasp the issue of attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought." Members of revolutionary committees at all levels across the country have deeply felt during the process of learning from Comrade Men Hengzhi that the fundamental reason why Comrade Men Hengzhi could be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is that he was consciously and thoroughly loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, and consistently studied Chairman Mao's works with a hunger and thirst, adhering to the excellent learning style of learning and applying in practice. Members and staff of revolutionary committees at all levels in Liaoning, Jilin, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Ningxia provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have unanimously expressed in their studies that they will take Comrade Men Hengzhi as an example, with deep proletarian feelings, better learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, criticize and transform their worldview, and in the storms of class struggle and line struggle, constantly temper their loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, striving to always consciously stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Members of the revolutionary committees of Beijing No. 2 Rolling Mill and Beijing Knitting General Factory, during the learning process, summarized the experience of leading the masses to learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought and grasp class struggle since the establishment of the revolutionary committees. Members of the revolutionary committees seriously found their gaps, took measures, and decided to be like Comrade Men Hengzhi, better learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, achieving "thinking of Chairman Mao in everything, submitting to Chairman Mao in everything, following Chairman Mao in everything, and doing everything for Chairman Mao." Members of the revolutionary committee and grassroots revolutionary leading groups of the Sixth Motor Vehicle Depot of the Qinghai Provincial Transportation Management Bureau, during the learning process, seriously found their gaps, and decided to take Comrade Men Hengzhi as an example, "learning Chairman Mao's instructions, studying diligently, propagating Chairman Mao's instructions, without stopping for a second, implementing Chairman Mao's instructions, thoroughly, defending Chairman Mao's instructions, unshakably."

The great leader Chairman Mao recently taught us: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship." Chairman Mao also taught us: "Serve the people wholeheartedly, never leave the masses for a moment." Members of revolutionary committees at all levels across the country, after learning the central command and Comrade Men Hengzhi's brilliant deeds, decided to be like Comrade Men Hengzhi, to be the people's ox for life, to pull the revolutionary cart for life, to always breathe and share the fate with the broad masses of the people. They resolutely expressed that they must fully mobilize the masses, rely on the broad masses of the people, lead the revolutionary masses to launch a fierce attack on the class enemies, and accurately and fiercely strike a small handful of class enemies, fully displaying the great power of the broad masses of the people under the leadership of the proletarian party, and further strengthening the great proletarian dictatorship. Members of the Tianzhu County Revolutionary Committee in Guizhou Province, after learning from Comrade Men Hengzhi's heroic deeds, immediately formed Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams with grassroots revolutionary committee members, went deep into remote areas, worked, studied, and grasped class struggle with the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, and decided to build the revolutionary committee into a revolutionary leadership team that is loyal to Chairman Mao and connected with the masses. After learning from Comrade Men Hengzhi's brilliant deeds, some places' revolutionary committee members found their gaps and immediately went to grassroots units where the learning and application of Mao Zedong Thought was relatively good, treated workers and peasants as teachers, widely solicited opinions, and promoted the thought revolutionization of the leading cadres. Many members of revolutionary committees at all levels expressed that they must be like Comrade Men Hengzhi, and in their lifetime, all words and deeds, all work must be for the liberation of the people, and in their lifetime, every moment, every second must be for the interests of the people.

Currently, the campaign to learn from Comrade Men Hengzhi is further developing more broadly and deeply across the country. Under the leadership of revolutionary committees at all levels, learning activities in various places are further combined with the current tasks of struggle, further combined with implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and have become a powerful driving force to inspire the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses across the country to achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    新华社九日讯　全国各省、市、自治区各级革命委员会成员，最坚决地响应以伟大领袖毛主席为首、以林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的伟大号召，同全国无产阶级革命派和亿万革命群众一道，掀起了一个规模巨大的向“无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部”门合同志学习的热潮。各地各级革命委员会成员表示，一定要把这个具有重大意义的学习活动同当前阶级斗争形势和斗争任务紧密结合起来，推动全国无产阶级革命派和亿万革命群众更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更好地紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，进一步落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    各地各级革命委员会成员还表示，一定要以伟大的共产主义战士门合同志为榜样，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的大风大浪中，把自己锻炼成为无限忠于人民，无限忠于党，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席革命路线的坚强革命战士，把各级革命委员会建设成为高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗、突出无产阶级政治、密切联系群众的革命战斗指挥部。
    伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席亲自批准追授门合同志光荣称号的命令发布以来，各省、市、自治区各级革命委员会成员带头掀起了向门合同志学习的热潮。许多省、市、自治区的革命委员会连续召开常委会议，认真学习门合同志的光辉事迹。不少省、市、自治区的各级革命委员会，专门举办了学习门合同志先进事迹的毛泽东思想学习班。许多地区的各级革委会成员，一边学习，一边行动，背起背包，深入到群众中去，和群众一道贯彻中央的命令，宣传门合同志的革命精神和英雄事迹。青海省革命委员会常委会最近专门召开三次向门合同志学习的会议，决定立即举办学习班，把全省县级以上革委会成员集中起来学习两个星期，以门合同志为光辉榜样，来推动当前的斗争，推动各级革命委员会的革命化建设。河北省藁城县革命委员会成员，学习门合同志英勇捍卫毛主席革命路线的光辉事迹以后，进一步提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟，带领全县县、社两级革命干部二千多人，身背行李，深入生产队，同贫下中农一起大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，深入开展革命大批判，向阶级敌人发起了更加猛烈的进攻。毛主席家乡韶山公社的革命委员会成员，为门合同志的光辉事迹所鼓舞，带领广大革命群众和红卫兵小将，在毛主席旧居前，向伟大领袖毛主席庄严宣誓：永远忠于毛主席的革命路线，时刻为毛主席的革命路线放好哨，站好岗，打好仗。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风，在路线问题上没有调和的余地。”各地各级革委会成员在学习中更加深刻地认识到，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线是我们的命根子，是革命胜利的根本保证。
    北京、上海、天津、山西、内蒙古、黑龙江、湖北、湖南、广东、甘肃等省、市、自治区革命委员会成员在学习中都指出，坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，我们的国家就能在社会主义、共产主义的大道上阔步前进，无产阶级和劳动人民就有了一切；离开了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，我们的党和国家就会改变颜色，无产阶级和劳动人民就会丧失一切。我们一定要带领广大革命群众持久深入地开展革命大批判，把中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线彻底批倒批臭，把隐藏的叛徒、特务、反革命分子挖出来，坚决粉碎阶级敌人刮起的右倾翻案妖风，让毛主席的革命路线永远指引我们胜利前进。许多地方的各级革命委员会，对照门合同志的光辉事迹，专门开会检查了自己在执行和捍卫毛主席革命路线方面的自觉程度，决心时时事事坚持毛主席的革命路线，为捍卫毛主席的革命路线而奋斗终生。贵州省革命委员会的负责人说，我们一定要象门合同志那样，把无限忠于毛主席革命路线作为第一生命，把坚决执行和捍卫毛主席革命路线作为自己终生的神圣职责。浙江省革命委员会的负责人表示，我们学习门合同志，就要把捍卫毛主席的革命路线作为自己最根本的革命大节，自觉捍卫，彻底捍卫，誓死捍卫。江西省和河北省革命委员会的成员指出，忠不忠于毛主席的革命路线，是革命和不革命的分水岭。我们一定要向门合同志学习，在灵魂深处爆发革命，彻底改造世界观，做一辈子坚决捍卫毛主席革命路线的好战士。
    林副主席指示我们：“对毛泽东思想抱什么态度，是一个很重要的问题。我们就是要抓对毛主席的态度、对毛泽东思想的态度问题。”各地各级革命委员会成员在向门合同志学习的过程中深深体会到，门合同志所以能够无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，最根本的一条，就是因为他对伟大领袖毛主席自觉地忠，彻底地忠，一贯如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作，坚持活学活用、学用结合的优良学风。辽宁、吉林、山东、江苏、安徽、河南、四川、陕西、宁夏等省、市、自治区各级革命委员会的成员和工作人员，在学习中一致表示要以门合同志为榜样，带着深厚的无产阶级感情，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，斗私批修，改造世界观，在阶级斗争和路线斗争的大风大浪中不断锤炼自己对毛主席、对毛泽东思想的赤胆忠心，努力做到永远自觉地站在毛主席的革命路线一边。北京第二轧钢厂和北京针织总厂的革命委员会成员，在学习过程中，总结了革命委员会成立以来带领群众活学活用毛泽东思想和狠抓阶级斗争的经验。革委会成员认真找差距，订措施，决心象门合同志那样，更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，做到“一切想着毛主席，一切服从毛主席，一切紧跟毛主席，一切为着毛主席”。青海省运输管理局第六汽车场革命委员会和基层革命领导小组成员，在学习中认真地找差距，他们决心以门合同志为榜样，“学习毛主席指示，刻苦认真，宣传毛主席指示，分秒不停，执行毛主席指示，完全彻底，捍卫毛主席指示，坚定不移。”
    伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”毛主席还教导我们：“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众”。各地各级革委会成员学习了中央的命令和门合同志的光辉事迹，决心象门合同志那样当一辈子人民的牛，拉一辈子革命的车，永远和广大人民群众同呼吸，共命运。他们坚决表示，一定要最充分地放手发动群众，最坚决地依靠广大人民群众，带领革命群众向阶级敌人猛烈进攻，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，充分发挥无产阶级政党领导下的广大人民群众的专政的巨大威力，进一步加强伟大的无产阶级专政。贵州省天柱县革委会成员学习了门合同志的英雄事迹，立即同基层革委会成员一道组成毛泽东思想宣传队，深入到边远地区，同广大贫下中农一起劳动，一起学习，一起狠抓阶级斗争，决心把革委会建设成为忠于毛主席的革命化的联系群众的领导班子。有的地方的革委会成员学习门合同志的光辉事迹以后，找出差距，立即下到活学活用毛泽东思想比较好的基层单位，拜工农群众为师，广泛征求意见，促进了领导班子的思想革命化。许多地方的各级革委会成员表示，一定要象门合同志那样，一生中一切言行、一切工作都要为着解放人民，一生中一时一刻、一分一秒都要为了人民的利益而工作。
    目前，全国各地学习门合同志的热潮，正在更加广泛深入地向前发展。在各级革命委员会的领导下，各地的学习活动正进一步同当前的斗争任务紧密结合起来，同进一步落实毛主席的一系列最新指示紧密结合起来，成为激励全国无产阶级革命派和亿万革命群众乘胜前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的强大推动力量。
