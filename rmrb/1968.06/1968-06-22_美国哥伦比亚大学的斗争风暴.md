The nearly two-month-long strike by students at Columbia University in New York is continuing to develop. This struggle marks a new stage in the progressive student movement in the United States.

Breaking Through Strict Control to Launch the Struggle

Columbia University, with 25,000 students, is an important institution for the American monopoly bourgeoisie to cultivate their successors and high-level strategists. It is one of twelve universities, along with the University of California, Roosevelt University, and others, that are contract research units for the U.S. Department of Defense's Defense and Arms Control Agency. The university's board of trustees consists of 22 members, all of whom are big businessmen and bankers in the United States. The chairman of the board, Paley, is the owner of Columbia Broadcasting Company, and the university president, Kirk, is a major shareholder in large oil companies, public utilities, and the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Company, as well as a director of the Asia Foundation of the Central Intelligence Agency.

Columbia University, as the largest landlord adjacent to Harlem, the largest black slum in New York, has been widely condemned by the broad masses of black people as a "landlord," "tyrant," and "racist stronghold" for its octopus-like occupation of black residential areas and public spaces, and for forcibly demolishing slum shacks. These crimes and notorious names indicate that it has long aroused the deep hatred and strong opposition of students and blacks.

Now, the students of this school have risen up. Since April 23, students have been fighting around three serious demands, launching a magnificent movement. The first demand is to stop Columbia University from occupying one of the few parks in Harlem, Morningside Park, to build a gymnasium. The second demand is to order "Columbia University to withdraw from the Defense and Arms Control Agency." The third is to oppose the reactionary school authorities' punishment of students who have been fighting for the above two demands. Because progressive students have been fighting for these two just demands for a long time, the school authorities not only ignored them but also threatened to expel six students. Students have come to realize from the struggle that to oppose racial discrimination and the Vietnam War, they must closely combine the fight against political persecution and against enslaved education.

Opening a New Chapter in the American Student Movement

Columbia University students have taken a series of revolutionary actions. On April 23, more than 400 students first occupied Hamilton Hall in Columbia College and detained the dean, Coleman, exposing his plot to deceive students into negotiations. Students also raised a red flag on the roof of Hamilton Hall and wrote the name of the university, named after Malcolm X, the black leader killed by the American imperialists, on the horizontal signboard.

Another 100 students rushed into Low Library, occupied the president's office, and found Kirk's contact phone book with the Central Intelligence Agency and some reactionary documents and files.

In the short span of three days from April 23 to 25, students successively occupied five buildings. They named these buildings the first to fifth "liberated zones" in the order of occupation. In front of the large windows of the Mathematics Building, students hung a giant portrait of Marx. In the "liberated zones," students organized a fighting collective life and carried out organized collective fighting activities. To smash the reactionary authorities' plot to use hunger to force students to retreat, a group of black students rushed out of the hall they occupied, broke through the tight blockade, and threw batches of bread, cans, and food to the students, foiling the enemy's trick.

In the occupied buildings, students held democratic discussions and printed small newspapers, leaflets, and statements using mimeograph machines. They also used walkie-talkies to communicate between the "liberated buildings."

Black Americans Support Student Struggle

The students' just struggle strongly infected the people of Harlem, gaining their strong support. Workers in Harlem's bars, restaurants, and hospitals, as well as black community organizations, successively donated money to support the brave students. Outside Hamilton Hall on the avenue, blacks gathered to set up picket lines and lit candles to guard at night. When students fought with the police who came to suppress them, two groups of 100 and 116 blacks came to support the students' battle. Those who came to support included not only several community organizations in Harlem but also blacks from various walks of life in the Bronx and Brooklyn of New York City. A cafeteria in Harlem also donated hot food to the students who were on strike and occupying buildings every day.

Defeating Military-Police Suppression, Pushing the Struggle Forward

The first round of the struggle by Columbia University students was on April 30, when they resisted the crazy armed suppression by more than 1,000 police. At that time, students linked arms and shouted, "We stand firm!" "Defense and Arms Control Agency, get out!" "Do not persecute blacks!"

The reactionary authorities originally wanted to use violence to suppress the storm, but this action actually further promoted the students' common struggle. When 728 arrested students were taken away in police vans, students from the school and nearby schools came to Broadway, blocking the police cars with their bodies and fighting with the mounted police who were brutally chasing the students. On May 1, more than 1,500 university students held a grand mass rally in the campus to support the arrested students. On that day, hundreds of students went to the avenue in front of Hamilton Hall, merging with the tens of thousands of high school and university students in New York City and the black middle school students in Harlem into a surging tide of support. After that, in early May and late May, Columbia University students launched two more rounds of heroic struggles, successively occupying two buildings.

The just struggle of Columbia University students has lasted nearly two months so far, keeping the university paralyzed and making the U.S. reactionary authorities anxious. On June 3, with the support of the U.S. ruling authorities, the reactionary authorities of Columbia University ordered more than 700 students who occupied five buildings at the end of April to "voluntarily suspend their studies." The university authorities were terrified of the student struggle and secretly changed the graduation ceremony, which should have been held on campus, to St. John's Church. The high-pressure tactics of the school authorities did not frighten the progressive students. On June 4, more than 1,500 Columbia University students held a large-scale demonstration in New York, surrounding St. John's Church. At the same time, more than 200 senior students withdrew from the graduation ceremony, protesting the university authorities' political persecution of students.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The student movement is part of the entire people's movement. The high tide of the student movement will inevitably promote the high tide of the entire people's movement."

The struggle storm at Columbia University arose with the development of the black movement in the United States and, in turn, had a great impact on the black movement. It is a component of the struggle of the American people against aggressive wars and the rule of American monopoly capital. With the further deepening of the political and economic crises of American imperialism, the progressive student movement and the entire people's movement in the United States will inevitably rise to greater heights.

    美国哥伦比亚大学的斗争风暴
    已经坚持了将近两个月的纽约哥伦比亚大学学生的罢课斗争，正在继续发展。这场斗争标志着美国进步学生运动的新发展。
    冲破严密的控制起来斗争
    拥有二万五千名学生的哥伦比亚大学，是美国垄断资产阶级培养他们的接班人和高级谋士的重要场所。它与加利福尼亚大学、罗斯福大学等十二所大学，同是美国国防部国防分析研究所这个黑机构的合同研究单位。它的董事会的二十二名董事，都是美国大企业、大银行老板。董事会主席佩利是哥伦比亚广播公司老板，校长柯克是大石油商、公用企业和洲际弹道导弹公司大股东、中央情报局的亚洲基金会董事。
    哥伦比亚大学当局又是同纽约最大的黑人贫民窟哈莱姆区相毗邻的最大房产主，由于它象章鱼一样侵占黑人住宅区、公共场所，强迫拆迁贫民区的棚户，因而被广大的黑人群众痛骂为“把头”、“恶霸”、“种族主义堡垒”……。这些罪行和恶名，表明它早就激起了学生和黑人的切齿痛恨和强烈反对。
    现在，这所学校的学生起来了。从四月二十三日起，学生们就围绕着三个严正要求展开斗争，掀起了一场轰轰烈烈的运动。第一坚决要求哥伦比亚大学当局停止侵占哈莱姆区的很少的几个公园之一莫宁赛德公园修建体育馆；第二个要求是勒令“哥伦比亚大学退出国防分析研究所”；第三是反对反动的校当局处分为坚持上述两项要求而斗争的学生。因为进步学生已经为前两项正义要求进行了长时期斗争，校方不但置之不理，而且还扬言要开除六名学生。学生们从斗争中体会到，要反对种族歧视、反对侵越战争，就必须同反对政治迫害、反对奴化教育紧密地结合起来。
    开创了美国学运的新局面
    哥伦比亚大学的学生连续采取了一系列富有战斗性的革命行动。四月二十三日，四百多名学生首先占领哥伦比亚学院的主楼汉密尔顿大厅，并把教务长柯尔曼扣留起来，戳穿了他诱骗学生搞谈判的阴谋。学生们还在汉密尔顿大厅楼顶上升起了红旗，在大厅的横匾额上写上以被美帝杀害的黑人领袖马尔科姆·爱克斯命名的大学的字样。
    另外一百名学生冲进洛氏图书馆，占领了校长柯克的办公室，搜查到了柯克与特务机构中央情报局的联系电话号码本和一些反动的文件、档案等。
    从四月二十三日到二十五日这短短三天里，学生们先后占领了五座大楼。他们按占领的次序，又命名这些楼为第一至第五“解放区”。在数学大楼楼前大窗上，学生们悬挂了巨幅马克思画像。在“解放区”，学生们组织起一种战斗的集体生活，进行着有组织的集体的战斗活动。为了粉碎反动当局企图用饥饿胁迫学生退却的毒计，一批黑人学生从他们所占领的大厅冲出来，突破了严密封锁，向学生抛掷了一批批的面包、罐头和食品，击退了敌人的花招。
    在被占领的各座楼里，学生们展开了民主讨论，并用油印机印发小报、传单、声明。他们还用步行对话机在“解放楼”之间相互联系。
    美国黑人支持学生斗争
    学生们的正义斗争，强烈地感染了哈莱姆区的人民，得到了他们强大的支持。哈莱姆的酒吧间、饭馆、医院的工人们和黑人群众组织，都先后捐款资助英勇斗争的学生们；在汉密尔顿大厅外的大道上，黑人们聚集起来布置纠察线，晚上还点起蜡烛守卫。在学生们同前来镇压的警察展开搏斗的时刻，先后有一百名和一百十六名的两批黑人特意来声援学生们的战斗。前来支援的不仅有哈莱姆的几个群众组织，还有纽约市的布朗克斯和布鲁克林的各界黑人群众。有一家哈莱姆的食堂还每天给罢课占楼的学生捐送热食物。
    粉碎军警镇压，把斗争推向前进
    哥伦比亚大学学生斗争的第一个回合，就是在四月三十日反击一千多名警察疯狂的武装镇压。这时学生们手挽着手高呼“我们屹立不动！”“国防分析研究所滚蛋！”“不许迫害黑人！”
    反动当局原来想使用暴力把这场风暴压下去，但是，这种行动恰恰更加促进了学生们的共同的斗争。当被捕的七百二十八名学生被拉上囚车时，本校的以及附近学校的学生都来到百老汇路上，用身子拦住警察的汽车，并同残酷地追逐学生的骑警搏斗。五月一日，一千五百多名大学生又在校园举行声势浩大的群众大会，声援被捕同学。这一天，几百学生到汉密尔顿大厅前的大道上，同纽约市成千上万的大中学生、哈莱姆区的黑人中学生汇成声援的洪流。在这以后，五月初和五月底，哥伦比亚大学学生又进行了两个回合的英勇斗争，先后占领过两座大楼。
    哥伦比亚大学学生的正义斗争，到目前已坚持了将近两个月。这使得这所大学一直陷于瘫痪，美国反动当局为此惊慌不安。六月三日，哥伦比亚大学反动当局在美国统治当局的支持下，悍然勒令四月底占领学校五所大楼的七百多名学生“自动停学”。大学当局对学生斗争怕得要命，把本应在校内举行的毕业典礼偷偷改在校外圣约翰教堂去举行。校方的高压手段并没有吓倒进步学生，六月四日，有一千五百多名哥伦
  比亚大学学生在纽约举行大规模的示威游行，包围了圣约翰教堂；同时，有二百多名高年级学生退出了毕业典礼，抗议大学当局对学生进行政治迫害。
    我们的伟大导师毛主席教导说：“学生运动是整个人民运动的一部分。学生运动的高涨，不可避免地要促进整个人民运动的高涨。”
    哥伦比亚大学的斗争风暴，是随着美国黑人运动发展起来的，同时又给予黑人运动以巨大的影响。它是美国人民反对侵略战争、反对美国垄断资本统治的斗争的一个组成部分。随着美帝国主义政治和经济危机的进一步加深，美国的进步学生运动和整个人民运动必将会有更大的高涨。　（辛参）（附图片）
