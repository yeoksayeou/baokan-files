Over 1,400 foreign friends visited the "Memorial Exhibition for White," highly praising Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Three Articles" and extolling Comrade White's communist and internationalist spirit.

Xinhua News Agency, June 24th: Over 1,400 foreign friends from more than 40 countries and regions visited the "Memorial Exhibition for White" in Beijing, which concluded on June 21st. They enthusiastically praised the exhibition as an excellent classroom for studying Mao Zedong Thought. Many foreign friends expressed their determination to learn from Comrade White, whom Chairman Mao praised, and to strive to learn Mao Zedong Thought.

Among these foreign friends were comrades from Marxist-Leninist brother parties and proletarian revolutionaries from around the world, warriors from the anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist fronts in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, foreign experts helping China with socialist construction, and friends from various countries in Beijing. During the visit, some were moved to tears by Comrade White's great communist spirit, which Chairman Mao praised. Others expressed their resolve to learn from and apply Chairman Mao's essay "In Memory of Norman Bethune" to the lecturers. Some wrote down their thoughts in the guestbook, while others held discussions in the exhibition hall after the visit, sharing their experiences and insights on studying "Three Articles" and learning from Comrade White. They said, "This exhibition is excellent," "It is one of the best exhibitions I have seen."

In the exhibition hall, there is a large oil painting depicting our great leader Chairman Mao having a cordial conversation with Comrade White in March 1938. Many foreign friends lingered in front of this painting, unwilling to leave. It is a very moving scene: in the sunlit cave dwelling in Yan'an, Chairman Mao is having a friendly conversation with Comrade White. Comrade White looks up at Chairman Mao, his excited expression vividly portrayed. Next to this painting, there is a display of Comrade White's diary entry from the night he met Chairman Mao. He wrote, "He is a giant! He is one of the greatest figures in the world." A New Zealand friend said after reading it, "It is natural for White to love Chairman Mao; this is the basic sentiment of a revolutionary." Comrade White's former comrade-in-arms, an American friend who fought alongside White in the Chinese resistance against Japan, introduced, "White eagerly wanted to meet Chairman Mao as soon as he arrived in Yan'an. He actively accepted Mao Zedong Thought, eagerly learning the theories, policies, and guidelines of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao in leading the Chinese revolution. Chairman Mao's reception and cordial conversation greatly encouraged him, filling him with more confidence in the world revolution and strengthening his resolve. It elevated his internationalist and communist spirit to new heights, making him a model for every communist and revolutionary to learn from."

Many foreign friends highly praised Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Three Articles" during their visit to the exhibition. A comrade from Albania on the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist front in Europe said, "I studied 'In Memory of Norman Bethune' at home, and now, after visiting this exhibition, I have a deeper understanding of this brilliant work.... Two hours of visiting made me see the immense power of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought." A friend from Sri Lanka said after the visit, "Every word and sentence in Chairman Mao's 'In Memory of Norman Bethune' is worth applying in our actual work and struggle. Visiting the exhibition made me clearer on how to actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought." A friend from Laos wrote in the guestbook, "Every proletarian revolutionary should learn from Comrade White's internationalist spirit, communist spirit, firm resolve, and spirit of serving the people. Only then can one truly become a revolutionary and a good student of Chairman Mao. To become a revolutionary like White, one must first truly learn Mao Zedong Thought." A friend from Malaya wrote in the guestbook, "From this exhibition, we can see the great teachings of the greatest contemporary Marxist-Leninist, Chairman Mao. We can also see the selfless spirit of the proletariat of Comrade White. This selfless spirit is being continuously developed by the great people of China under the guidance of Chairman Mao, the great leader and teacher of the Chinese and world revolution."

The Secretary-General of the Asian-African Journalists' Association, Chahardo, said, "All members of our Secretariat are studying 'Three Articles.' We have learned a lot from the exhibition. In the future, we will better learn from Comrade White's spirit of selflessness and dedication to serving the people of the world."

A friend from Indonesia wrote in the guestbook, "The exhibition of Dr. White is a lesson for us Indonesians in our struggle. Especially for me, I must spend my life actively learning and applying the great works of the greatest contemporary Marxist-Leninist, Comrade Mao Zedong, 'Three Articles.'"

Many foreign friends, after visiting the "Memorial Exhibition for White," felt that one visit was not enough and went for a second time. Some even took meticulous notes. Two friends from Laos and Canada said that such an exhibition that educates and inspires people is never enough to see. Many foreign friends, to express their love for the great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, firmly held the hands of the staff after the visit and excitedly said, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!"

    学习白求恩同志，为世界人民服务
    一千四百多位外国朋友参观了“纪念白求恩展览”，他们高度地评价了毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”，盛赞白求恩同志的共产主义和国际主义精神
    新华社二十四日讯　来自四十多个国家和地区的一千四百多位外国朋友，在北京参观了已于二十一日闭幕的“纪念白求恩展览”。他们热烈赞扬这个展览是很好的学习毛泽东思想的大课堂。许多外国朋友表示，要努力学习毛主席所表扬的白求恩同志的伟大共产主义精神和无产阶级国际主义精神，努力学习毛泽东思想。
    这些外国朋友中，有马克思列宁主义兄弟党的同志和世界各地的无产阶级革命战士，有来自亚非拉反帝、反殖斗争前线的战士，有帮助我国进行社会主义建设的外国专家和在北京的各国朋友。他们在参观中，有的被毛主席所表扬的白求恩同志的伟大共产主义精神感动得热泪盈眶，有的向讲解人员表示了他们向白求恩同志学习和学好用好毛主席《纪念白求恩》这篇光辉著作的决心，有的在留言簿上写下了自己的感想，还有些外国朋友，参观后就在展览馆举行座谈，畅谈学习《纪念白求恩》这篇光辉著作和学习白求恩同志的心得体会。他们说，“这个展览太好了”，“是我看过的一个很好的展览”。
    在展览大厅里，有一幅表现我们伟大领袖毛主席一九三八年三月和白求恩同志亲切交谈的大幅油画。不少外国朋友在这幅油画前久久不愿离开。这是一幅非常激动人心的画：在浴满阳光的延安窑洞里，毛主席在和白求恩同志亲切地交谈，白求恩同志仰望着毛主席，他倾听毛主席谈话时激动的神色，栩栩如生地再现在人们的面前。在这幅油画旁边，展出了白求恩同志在见到伟大领袖毛主席这天晚上写的日记。他在日记中写道：“这是一个巨人！他是我们世界上最伟大的人物之一。”一位新西兰朋友看后激动地说：“白求恩同志热爱毛主席是很自然的，这是一个革命者的基本感情。”白求恩同志的生前战友、和白求恩一起在中国参加过抗日战争的美国朋友马海德看了后向大家介绍说：“白求恩一到延安就渴望见到毛主席，非常积极地接受了毛泽东思想，如饥似渴地学习中国共产党和毛主席领导中国革命的理论、方针和政策。毛主席的接见和亲切谈话，使他受到极大的鼓舞，使他对世界革命更加充满信心，斗志更加坚定”，“使他的国际主义精神和共产主义精神发展到了新的高度，成为我们每个共产党员和每个革命者学习的榜样。”
    不少外国朋友在参观展览时，高度评价了毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”。来自欧洲反帝反修前线的一位阿尔巴尼亚同志说：“在国内学习了《纪念白求恩》，现在又参观了这个展览，更加深了我对这篇光辉著作的理解。……两个小时的参观，使我看到了马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的巨大威力。”一位锡兰朋友参观后说：“毛主席的《纪念白求恩》，每字每句都值得我们在实际工作和斗争中运用。参观了展览，使我更明确了要怎样活学活用毛泽东思想。”老挝的一位朋友在留言簿上写道：“每个无产阶级革命战士，都应该学习白求恩同志的国际主义精神、共产主义精神，坚强的斗志和为人民服务的精神。这样，才能真正成为一个革命者，才能成为毛主席的好学生。要成为一个白求恩式的革命者的保证，首先得真正学好毛泽东思想。”马来亚的一位朋友在留言簿上写道：“从这个展览会我们可以看到当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛主席的伟大教导。我们也可以看到白求恩同志的无产阶级的大公无私的精神。这种大公无私的精神，正为中国和世界革命的伟大导师和领袖毛主席指引下的伟大的中国人民所不断发展。”
    亚非新闻工作者协会总书记查禾多说：“我们书记处全体成员都在学习‘老三篇’。我们看了展览，学到了很多东西。今后要更好地学习白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，为世界人民服务。”
    来自印度尼西亚的一位朋友在留言簿上写道：“白求恩医生的展览，对我们斗争中的印度尼西亚是一个教益。特别是我，必须一辈子活学活用当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志的伟大著作‘老三篇’。”
    不少外国朋友在参观“纪念白求恩展览”时，看了一次不满足，又去看第二次，有的还认真地作了笔记。老挝和加拿大的两位友人说，这样教育人、鼓舞人的展览是看不够的。很多外国朋友为了表达他们对无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席的热爱，看完展览后紧紧拉着工作人员的手激动地说：“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
