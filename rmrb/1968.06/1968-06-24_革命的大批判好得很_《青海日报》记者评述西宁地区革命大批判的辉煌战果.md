The unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution is the broadest and deepest revolutionary mass movement in history. Under the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary criticism carried out by hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses has, with unprecedented breadth and depth, exposed and criticized the handful of capitalist roaders, traitors, spies, all counter-revolutionaries, and landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have not been reformed, cleansing the muddy waters of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism. "All the decayed ideological and superstructural elements that are not suitable for the new society are collapsing day by day."

The vast revolutionary criticism in the Xining region has proven: the revolutionary criticism is unstoppable wherever it is directed; the revolutionary criticism has become a powerful driving force for the proletarian cultural revolution to develop in depth. Especially under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the revolutionary criticism has entered a new high tide, further demonstrating its immense power.

The revolutionary criticism has raised the class struggle consciousness and the consciousness of the struggle between the two lines, making Chairman Mao's revolutionary line deeply rooted in people's hearts.

Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the first proletarian cultural revolution in human history, proposing a complete set of theories, lines, principles, and policies for continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. It deeply revealed the laws of class struggle in socialist society, developing the fundamental issue of class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat in Marxism-Leninism to a higher stage in theory and practice. The broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries in the Xining region, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, through the exposure and criticism of the anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought crimes of the handful of capitalist roaders like China's Khrushchev and their agents in various regions and departments, and through the criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, have further deeply realized: to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, it is necessary to thoroughly expose and criticize the handful of capitalist roaders within the party, and to firmly grasp the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. The broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries have become more conscious and more resolute in defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The masses who were once deceived, through the revolutionary criticism, gradually saw through the true face of the handful of capitalist roaders within the party and gradually saw through the essence of the bourgeois reactionary line, which is to restore capitalism and make the working people suffer again. Some comrades who had once stood on the wrong side deeply said: In the struggle between the two lines, everyone has their own position and tendency. Only by consciously standing on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line can one sharply distinguish and resist the bourgeois reactionary line and not be deceived by it. After raising their consciousness of the struggle between the two lines, they immediately firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, with immense class hatred, actively joining the ranks of the revolutionary criticism. The ranks of the proletarian revolutionaries rapidly expanded, forming a vast revolutionary army, burying the handful of capitalist roaders within the party in the vast ocean of the revolutionary mass movement. The broad revolutionary masses further improved their ability to distinguish between flowers and weeds and enhanced their skills in class struggle and line struggle in the revolutionary criticism.

The revolutionary criticism repelled the rightist reversal wind, further exposed the class struggle lids of various units, and promoted the proletarian cultural revolution to develop in depth.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The proletarian cultural revolution is, in essence, a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under socialist conditions, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party and its leadership and the broad revolutionary masses of the people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." The broad revolutionary masses in the Xining region, in conjunction with the rectification of the party organization and the cleansing of the class ranks, recently focused their fire and targets on the revisionist party line and the revisionist cadre line, conducting in-depth exposure and criticism. The city of Xining recently held a criticism meeting with more than a thousand participants, exposing a large number of criminal facts of the old municipal party committee organization department controlled by the handful of capitalist roaders within the party, colluding with the enemy and forming cliques. Through large-scale exposure and criticism, the class lines of various units became clearer. The handful of traitors, spies, counter-revolutionaries, and remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries who were protected by the capitalist roaders and had long been hidden in party and government organs and factories and enterprises were forced to reveal their true colors under the powerful force of the people's dictatorship. This made the broad revolutionary masses more clearly realize: the representatives of the bourgeoisie who infiltrated the party are, in essence, the agents of the Kuomintang reactionaries within the Communist Party. Our struggle with them is, in essence, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Through large-scale exposure and criticism, the rightist reversal wind was effectively smashed. Wherever the revolutionary criticism was carried out well, the proletarian revolutionaries were all spirited and full of fighting spirit; the class enemies were forced to lower their heads and confess, their past arrogance swept away. Some comrades who originally thought that their unit had few problems and that the main task should be to focus on production and business, through the revolutionary criticism, overcame rightist conservative thoughts, realized that the struggle between the bourgeoisie's restoration and the proletariat's counter-restoration is long-term, sharp, and complex, and actively launched a fierce attack on the class enemies. The class enemies were one by one exposed, effectively undermining the social basis for China's Khrushchev to restore capitalism in China, promoting the proletarian cultural revolution to develop continuously in depth.

The revolutionary criticism promoted the widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought, powerfully criticized the reactionary bourgeois worldview, and profoundly changed the spiritual face of the revolutionary masses, making the proletariat further gain dominance in thought.

The revolutionary criticism is to use Mao Zedong Thought to criticize the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. The revolutionary masses in the Xining region deeply felt in the revolutionary criticism: Mao Zedong Thought is the sharpest weapon to criticize feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism. Mao Zedong Thought is a telescope and a microscope. Any demon or snake disguised as a "beauty" will reveal its true form under the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought. Only Mao Zedong Thought can ensure that our party and country will never change color and prevent the restoration of capitalism. Through the revolutionary criticism, the broad revolutionary masses further deepened their profound proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, forming a mass movement of consciously studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought study classes spread throughout the city of Xining and its suburbs, and "daily reading" has become a universally observed institution that cannot be disrupted by thunder. The broad masses of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, PLA soldiers and cadres, Red Guards, and office workers, through studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, have undergone profound changes in their spiritual outlook. They realized: the reason why the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev could be promoted in some places is mainly because some people have a bourgeois "self" in their minds. "Self" is the root of "revisionism," and "revisionism" is the fruit of "self." Only by thoroughly overthrowing the bourgeois "self," can the proletarian "public" further gain dominance, and can the proletariat's dominance in politics and economics be consolidated. The workshops, fields, classrooms, and kangs in the vast Xining region have all become battlefields for criticizing and repudiating revisionism. Good deeds and people who are selfless and serve the people wholeheartedly appear everywhere. Now, when people gather together, they exchange their experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and the situation and experiences of class struggle in various units, and share their insights and experiences in criticizing and repudiating revisionism. Anyone who intentionally or unintentionally spreads any of China's Khrushchev's black goods will immediately be refuted by the revolutionary masses. The shining image established by the "Three Articles" and the noble qualities of Comrade Lei Feng, who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, are increasingly deeply rooted in people's hearts and have become models that people strive to learn from and a criterion to examine their own actions.

The revolutionary criticism powerfully promoted the struggle-criticism-reform on all fronts and promoted the reform of the superstructure.

"Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism, is revolution. Destruction must be reasonable, and reasoning is construction. Destruction comes first, and construction is within it." The revolutionary criticism in the Xining region further proved the unparalleled wisdom and correctness of this thesis by our great leader Chairman Mao. The proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses on all fronts, holding high the banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought, launched a fierce attack on the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in industry, agriculture, political and legal affairs, literature and art, education, and scientific research. What "three autonomies and one contract," "material incentives," "expert line," "intellectual first," and so on, were all thoroughly criticized. The revolutionary peasants in the suburbs of Xining actively handed over the "ten edges land" they privately opened, and many production teams criticized the erroneous idea of "work points in command" and emphasized proletarian politics. The broad masses of workers, after criticizing the revisionist black goods such as the "expert line," liberated their minds, followed Chairman Mao's great teaching of "the masses are the real heroes," and carried forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to think, speak, and act, breaking countless outdated rules and customs, creating many efficient and labor-saving work procedures and methods. The geological exploration team used to have to report the data to the provincial geological bureau for approval, wasting time on the round trip, and some people did not investigate and study but issued orders blindly in the office. After the revolutionary criticism, everyone realized that the most intelligent and authoritative are the soldiers with the most practical experience. Under the leadership of the provincial geological bureau revolutionary committee, the design and construction plans were discussed and decided collectively by the masses on the spot, greatly improving work efficiency and project quality. The broad Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students, after criticizing the black goods of "intellectual first" and "grades in command," firmly took the road of "education serving proletarian politics, education combining with productive labor." Many revolutionary literary and art workers, after criticizing various fallacies such as "people's literature and art," further insisted on the direction of "literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, serving socialism, and serving to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat." The office workers and administrative management cadres also focused on criticizing the bureaucratic style of the old office system, bloated personnel, and detachment from the masses, and are carrying out in-depth reforms according to Chairman Mao's teaching of "streamlining administration, organizing a revolutionary and people-oriented leadership cadre."

In summary, all the superstructures that do not adapt to the socialist economic base are collapsing, and new thoughts, new cultures, new customs, and new habits that adapt to the socialist economic base are continuously forming.

The revolutionary criticism developed and consolidated the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and the factories and villages presented a prosperous scene.

The practice of many units in the Xining region has proven: in units that persistently and unremittingly carry out revolutionary criticism, with the struggle spearhead always aimed at the handful of class enemies and the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, there is no market for sectarianism, factionalism, anarchism, and the like, and the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" can be quickly realized and developed and consolidated. Before the revolutionary criticism was firmly grasped, only three units in the fourteen units under the Xining Food Company established revolutionary committees in three months; after the revolutionary criticism was firmly grasped, everyone united to fight against the enemy, and the entire company achieved the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" in one month.

The "Sixteen Articles" personally drafted by Chairman Mao point out: "The proletarian cultural revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of productive forces in our country." The revolutionary criticism not only powerfully promoted the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" but also powerfully promoted the development of industrial and agricultural production. The broad masses of workers and peasants guard their production posts during the day and study Chairman Mao's works at night, criticize and repudiate revisionism, criticize and repudiate selfishness, and the more they criticize, the greater their enthusiasm. The attendance rate of many production teams in the suburbs of Xining is higher than in previous years, and the spring sowing tasks are generally completed ahead of schedule. Many factories such as the Dongfeng Leather Factory also, in conjunction with the new situation and characteristics of class struggle, fiercely criticized anarchism, greatly strengthened socialist labor discipline, ensured that the production tasks were completed in excess every month, and technical innovation projects continuously emerged. The broad urban and rural areas presented a vibrant and prosperous scene.

At present, the revolutionary criticism in the Xining region is continuing with the momentum of a thunderous force, further cleansing the old world. The broad revolutionary workers, peasants, PLA soldiers and cadres, Red Guards, and revolutionary office workers are determined to further fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, strive to be defenders of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and are determined to carry out the revolutionary criticism deeply and persistently.

The broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses deeply felt in practice: the revolutionary criticism is not a temporary measure but a strategic measure; it is not dispensable but must be grasped; it is not far water that cannot save near fire but is effective as soon as it is grasped; it is not opposed to other work but is a powerful driving force for other work.

The revolutionary masses unanimously shouted: The revolutionary criticism is excellent!

    革命的大批判好得很
    ——《青海日报》记者评述西宁地区革命大批判的辉煌战果
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，是一场最广泛、最深刻的革命群众运动。亿万革命群众在毛泽东思想统帅下开展的革命大批判，以从来没有过的广度和深度，揭露和批判党内一小撮走资派、叛徒、特务、一切反革命分子和没有改造好的地富反坏右分子，荡涤着封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的污泥浊水。“一切腐朽的意识形态和上层建筑的其他不适用的部分，一天一天地土崩瓦解了。”
    西宁地区波澜壮阔的革命大批判证明：革命大批判矛头所指，所向披靡；革命大批判已成为推动无产阶级文化大革命向纵深发展的强大动力。特别是在毛主席最新指示指引下，革命大批判进入了一个新的高潮，更加显示了它的巨大威力。
      革命大批判提高了人们的阶
  级斗争觉悟和两条路线斗争觉
  悟，使毛主席的革命路线更加深
    入人心
    毛主席亲自发动和领导了人类历史上第一次无产阶级文化大革命，提出了一整套关于无产阶级专政条件下继续革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，深刻地揭示了社会主义社会的阶级斗争规律，把阶级斗争和无产阶级专政这个马克思列宁主义的根本问题，在理论上和实践上都发展到了更高的阶段。西宁地区的广大无产阶级革命派，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，通过对中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派及其在各地区各部门的代理人的反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行的揭露和批判，通过对反革命修正主义路线的批判，进一步深刻地认识到：为了巩固无产阶级专政，必须彻底揭露批判党内一小撮走资派，狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争。广大无产阶级革命派更加自觉地、更加坚定地起来捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。曾经受蒙蔽的群众通过革命的大批判，也逐步看清了党内一小撮走资派的真面目，逐步看清了资产阶级反动路线的实质是复辟资本主义，是要让劳动人民吃二遍苦。一些曾经一度站错队的同志深切地说：在两条路线斗争中，每个人都有自己的立场和倾向。只有自觉地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上，才能尖锐地识别和抵制资产阶级反动路线，不受其蒙蔽。他们在提高了两条路线斗争觉悟后，立即坚决地站在毛主席无产阶级革命路线一边，怀着无比的阶级仇恨，积极地投入革命大批判的行列。无产阶级革命派队伍迅速壮大，组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，把党内一小撮走资派埋葬在革命群众运动的汪洋大海之中。广大革命群众也在革命大批判中进一步提高了识别香花、毒草的能力，增长了阶级斗争、路线斗争的才干。
      革命大批判击退右倾翻案妖
  风，进一步揭开了各单位的阶级
  斗争盖子，推动无产阶级文化大
  革命向纵深发展
    毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”西宁地区的广大革命群众结合整顿党的组织和清理阶级队伍，在最近一个时期内，集中火力、集中目标对修正主义建党路线和修正主义干部路线进行了深入的揭露和批判。西宁市最近召开了有一千多人参加的批判大会，揭发了在党内一小撮走资派控制下的旧市委组织部招降纳叛、结党营私的大量罪恶事实。通过大揭发、大批判，使各单位的阶级阵线更加分明。被走资派包庇、长期隐藏在党政机关和工厂企业内的一小撮叛徒、特务、反革命分子等国民党反动派残渣余孽，在群众专政的强大威力下纷纷现出了原形。这样就使广大革命群众更加清楚地认识到：混入党内的资产阶级代表人物，实质上是国民党反动派在共产党内的代理人，我们和他们的斗争，实质上是共产党和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续。通过大揭发，大批判，有力地粉碎了右倾翻案妖风。凡是革命大批判开展得好的地方或单位，无产阶级革命派无不扬眉吐气，斗志昂扬；阶级敌人被迫纷纷低头认罪，昔日威风扫地以尽。一些原来认为本单位问题不大，主要应该集中精力抓生产、抓业务的同志，通过革命大批判，克服了右倾保守思想，认识到资产阶级复辟与无产阶级反复辟的斗争是长期的、尖锐的、复杂的，从而主动积极地对阶级敌人展开了猛烈的进攻，阶级敌人一个又一个地被揪了出来，有力地摧垮了中国赫鲁晓夫在中国复辟资本主义的社会基础，推动无产阶级文化大革命不断向纵深发展。
      革命大批判促进了毛泽东思
  想的大普及，有力地批判了反动
  的资产阶级世界观，革命群众精
  神面貌发生了深刻的变化，使无
  产阶级在思想上进一步取得统治
  地位
    革命大批判，就是用毛泽东思想批判资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的思想。西宁地区的革命群众，在革命大批判中深深体会到：毛泽东思想是批判封建主义、资本主义、修正主义最锐利的武器。毛泽东思想是望远镜、显微镜，任何妖魔鬼怪或化妆成“美女”的毒蛇，都在毛泽东思想阳光下现出原形。只有毛泽东思想，才能保证我党我国永不变色，才能防止资本主义复辟。通过革命大批判，广大革命群众进一步加深了对毛主席和毛泽东思想的无产阶级深厚感情，形成了群众性的自觉地活学活用毛泽东思想的运动。毛泽东思想学习班遍及西宁全城和郊区，“天天读”已成为普遍的自觉遵守的制度，雷打不散。广大工人、贫下中农、人民解放军指战员和红卫兵小将、机关干部，通过活学活用毛泽东思想，精神面貌发生了深刻的变化。他们认识到：中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线之所以在某些地方得以推行，最主要的就是因为有些人头脑中有个资产阶级“私”字。“私”是“修”之根，“修”是“私”之果，只有彻底打倒资产阶级“私”字，无产阶级的“公”字才能进一步取得统治地位，才能巩固无产阶级在政治上、经济上取得的统治地位。西宁广大地区的车间、田野、课堂、炕头都成了斗私批修的战场，以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的反动的资产阶级世界观受到猛烈的批判。为公忘私、全心全意为人民服务的好人好事到处出现。现在，人们相聚一起便交流活学活用毛主席著作和各单位进行阶级斗争的情况和经验，交流斗私批修的心得和体会。谁要在有意或无意中散布中国赫鲁晓夫的什么黑货色，立即会遭到革命群众的有力批驳。“老三篇”树立的光辉形象和“无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部”门合同志的崇高品质日益深入人心，愈来愈成为人们争相学习的榜样和检验自己行动的准则。
      革命大批判有力地推动了各
  条战线的斗批改，推动了上层建
  筑的改革
      “不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。”西宁地区的革命大批判进一步证明了我们伟大领袖毛主席这一论断的无比英明和正确。各条战线的无产阶级革命派和革命群众，高举毛泽东思想革命批判大旗，向工业、农业、政法、文艺、教育、科研等战线上的反革命修正主义路线发起猛烈的进攻。什么“三自一包”、“物质刺激”，什么“专家路线”、“智育第一”等等，都受到了彻底的批判。西宁郊区的许多革命农民主动交出私开的“十边地”，不少生产队批判了“工分挂帅”的错误思想，突出了无产阶级政治。广大工人群众在批判了“专家路线”等修正主义黑货之后，解放了思想，遵照毛主席“群众是真正的英雄”的伟大教导，发扬敢想、敢说、敢干的革命精神，打破了名目繁多的陈规陋习，创造了许多效率高、节省人力的工作程序和工作方法。地质勘测队过去打钻孔要把资料报到省地质局去批准，往返浪费时间不说，有些人不调查研究，坐在办公室里瞎指挥。经过革命大批判，大家认识到最聪明、最有发言权的是最有实践经验的战士。在省地质局革委会领导下，设计和施工方案就地交群众集体讨论，然后作出决定，大大提高了工作效率和工程质量。广大红卫兵小将和革命师生，在批判了“智育第一”、“分数挂帅”的黑货以后，坚决走“教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”的道路。许多革命的文艺工作者，批判了“全民文艺”等形形色色谬论，进一步坚持了“文艺为工农兵服务、为社会主义服务、为巩固无产阶级专政服务”的方向。机关工作和行政管理工作干部也集中批判了旧机关机构臃肿、人浮于事和脱离群众的官僚作风，正在按照毛主席“精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”的教导，进行深入的改革。总之，各条战线上一切不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑正在土崩瓦解，适应社会主义经济基础的新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯正在不断形成。
      革命大批判发展和巩固了革
  命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，
  工厂、农村一片欣欣向荣景象
    西宁地区许多单位的实践证明：哪个单位始终坚持不懈地进行革命大批判，斗争矛头始终对准一小撮阶级敌人和反革命修正主义路线，哪个单位的山头主义、宗派主义、无政府主义等就没有市场，革命大联合和革命“三结合”就能得到迅速实现和发展巩固。西宁市食品公司所属十四个单位，在未抓紧革命大批判以前，三个月内只有三个单位成立了革命委员会；在抓紧革命大批判后，大家团结起来一致对敌，一个月内就实现了全公司的革命的“三结合”。
    毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”革命的大批判，不仅有力地推动了革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，同时也有力地推动了工农业生产的发展。广大工人、农民白天坚守生产岗位，晚上学习毛主席著作，斗私批修，斗掉私心，批臭资产阶级思想，愈批干劲愈大。西宁郊区许多生产队的出勤率比往年都高，春播任务普遍提前完成。东风皮毛厂等许多工厂还结合阶级斗争的新形势、新特点狠批无政府主义，大大加强了社会主义劳动纪律，保证了生产任务月月超额完成，技术革新项目不断出现。广大城乡呈现一片生气勃勃的繁荣景象。
    目前，西宁地区的革命大批判，正以雷霆万钧之势，继续荡涤着旧世界。广大革命的工人、农民、人民解放军指战员、红卫兵小将和革命的机关干部，决心进一步全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，争当毛主席无产阶级革命路线的捍卫者，彻底批判反革命修正主义路线，决心把革命大批判深入持久地开展下去。
    广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众在实践中深深体会到：革命大批判不是权宜之计，而是战略措施；不是可有可无，而是非抓不可；不是远水救不了近火，而是一抓就灵；不是和其他工作相对立，而是推动其他工作的强大动力。
    革命群众一致高呼：革命的大批判好得很！
