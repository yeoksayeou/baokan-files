Recently, due to work, I visited several communes in the Huaibei region. Along the way, I saw that the wheat was growing very well, with large ears and full grains. The commune members and cadres there said that this year's wheat harvest is already guaranteed. Now, the broad masses of commune members are busy preparing for the harvest of wheat and barley.

Facing this critical moment of the harvest, I noticed that some leading cadres of the production teams are not daring to lead production boldly and are not taking the initiative to organize the commune members to carry out the summer harvest. At the same time, I also discovered that a small handful of class enemies are trying to take advantage of the situation to cause trouble and sabotage the summer harvest.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "...I hope that all leading comrades, cadres, and the people of the liberated areas will seize the opportunity to grasp the key links in production and achieve greater results than last year." I believe that at present, we should seize the time, mobilize all human and material resources, and do a good job in the summer harvest to ensure a bumper harvest. During the summer harvest, we must pay close attention to the movements of class enemies, smash their sabotage plots at any time, protect the summer harvest, and safeguard the victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    一定要抓紧麦收
    最近，因为工作关系，我到淮北地区的几个公社转了转。沿路上看见麦子长势非常好，麦穗大，粒子饱，这里的社员和干部讲，今年的麦子丰收已成定局。现在，广大社员正在忙于收割大小麦的准备工作。
    面临着麦收的紧要时刻，我发现有的社队的领导干部，不敢大胆领导生产，不敢负责积极组织社员开展夏收，同时也发现一小撮阶级敌人企图乘机捣乱，破坏夏收。
    毛主席教导我们：“……希望一切解放区的领导同志、工作人员、人民群众，不失时机地掌握生产环节，取得比去年更大的成绩。”我认为，目前应当抓紧时间，动员一切人力物力，把夏收工作做好，保证丰产丰收。在夏收的时候，要严密注意阶级敌人的动向，随时粉碎他们的破坏阴谋，保卫夏收，保卫无产阶级文化大革命的胜利成果。
