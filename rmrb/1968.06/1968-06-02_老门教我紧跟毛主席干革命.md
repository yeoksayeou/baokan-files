I first met Comrade Men He in the autumn of 1963. During our first meeting, he asked me about the opinions of the Tibetan people regarding the army. I gave him a thumbs up and said, "Good! The People's Liberation Army is good!" Although our time together was brief, he left a deep impression on me: Comrade Men He was sincere, modest, and approachable.

Later, Comrade Men He led the troops to nearby communes to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, help the people harvest barley, and give haircuts to poor herders. I served as his translator.

In the spring of 1964, I accompanied him to visit Mohe Gan, a representative of the poor herders in Guinan County. On our return, he asked me, "Jita Jia, do you recognize your own name?" I replied, "Sort of." Old Men He sighed and said, "Yes! In the old society, you were a slave, and I was a hired hand. You herded sheep for Tibetan landlords, and I fed pigs for Han landlords. We were both bitter gourds on the same vine, with no right to education. It was Chairman Mao who saved us poor people from the abyss. Today, we are the masters of the state. If we don't learn to read, we can't study Chairman Mao's works well. If we don't study Chairman Mao's works well, we can't carry out the revolution." After saying this, he wrote five shining golden characters on my notebook: "Long Live Chairman Mao!" He taught me to read and write them one by one. Before leaving, he repeatedly instructed me, "You must study and apply Chairman Mao's works diligently and conscientiously, and also be a good propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought."

After the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, initiated and led by Chairman Mao, began, I firmly stood on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and joined the "August 18th" Red Guards Fighting Squad. One day, I passed by the Baca Farm and encountered Comrade Men He. He asked me with concern, "Which organization have you joined?" I said, "The 'August 18th' Red Guards Fighting Squad." He was very pleased and, holding my hand tightly, said, "Good, you have joined a revolutionary organization! 'August 18th' listens to Chairman Mao, dares to rebel against the handful of capitalist roaders within the party, this is the greatest good. We firmly support 'August 18th', and the military and the people will unite to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!" Comrade Men He's words warmed my heart and strengthened my resolve to defend Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Last February, a handful of capitalist roaders within the party in Qinghai Province, in collusion with counter-revolutionaries, stirred up a counter-revolutionary tide. We "August 18th" fighters were labeled as "counter-revolutionaries" and suffered cruel persecution. At that time, I longed to see my comrade Men He! I firmly believed that the general direction of "August 18th" was correct, and that Comrade Men He was correct!

The light of the red sun dispersed the clouds. Chairman Mao's voice echoed across the entire grassland, and the Central Committee rehabilitated "August 18th"! We "August 18th" fighters were so excited that we shouted "Long Live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" thousands of times. In early May, Comrade Men He came to Baca Farm to take charge of supporting the left. Seeing me, he said passionately, "Chairman Mao gave us a second life. We must read Chairman Mao's books better, listen to Chairman Mao's words, follow Chairman Mao, and forever carry out the revolution!"

On September 7th, I was attending a meeting in the township when I suddenly heard the news of Comrade Men He's unfortunate martyrdom. I simply couldn't believe my ears and hurriedly prepared a horse to rush to Baca, hoping to see our good Tibetan brother one last time. By the time I arrived at the farm, Comrade Men He's body had already been taken away. I stood at the scene of Comrade Men He's martyrdom, my heart surging with emotion, tears streaming down my face. Men He! You are the green pine on the snowy mountain, the eagle on the grassland, the close friend of the Tibetan people! It was you who taught me to love Chairman Mao, it was you who nourished my heart as a poor herder with Mao Zedong Thought, it was you who repeatedly helped me understand this most profound truth: to be a revolutionary, one must love Chairman Mao without limit, one must be loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line without limit. I made up my mind: I must be like you, "always thinking of Chairman Mao, always following Chairman Mao, always for Chairman Mao." Forever loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!

    老门教我紧跟毛主席干革命
    贵南县塔秀乡“八·一八”战士　吉太加（藏族）
    我是一九六三年秋天认识门合同志的。第一次见面，他就问长问短，征求藏族群众对部队有什么意见。我翘起大拇指说：“沙格（好的意思）！解放军沙格！”这次我们接触的时间很短，但却给我留下了很深刻的印象：门合同志诚恳、谦虚、平易近人。
    以后，门合同志带领部队在附近人民公社宣传毛泽东思想，帮助群众收割青稞，给贫苦牧民理发，都是我给他当翻译。
    一九六四年春天，我同他访问贵南县贫苦牧民代表莫合干。回来后，他问我：“吉太加，你认识自己的名字吗？”我说：“阿拉巴拉（勉强的意思）。”老门感叹地说：“是啊！旧社会你是奴隶，我是长工，你给藏族牧主放羊，我给汉族地主喂猪，咱们都是一根藤上的苦瓜，没有权利读书。是毛主席他老人家把我们穷人从火坑里救了出来。今天咱们当了国家的主人，不识字就没法好好学习毛主席著作，不学好毛主席著作，就没法干革命。”说完，他就在我的笔记本上工工正正地写了五个金光闪闪的大字：毛主席万岁！他一字一字地教我念，一笔一划地教我写。临走时，他还一再嘱咐我：“你要刻苦认真地学好用好毛主席著作，还要当好毛泽东思想的宣传员。”
    毛主席他老人家亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命开始以后，我坚决站在毛主席他老人家的革命路线一边，参加了“八·一八”红卫战斗队。一天，我路过巴仓农场，遇见了门合同志。他关切地问我：“你参加了什么组织？”我说：“参加了‘八·一八’红卫战斗队。”他听了非常高兴，紧紧地握着我的手说：“好，你参加的是革命组织！‘八·一八’听毛主席的话，敢造党内一小撮走资派的反，这是最大的好。我们坚决支持‘八·一八’，军民团结在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”门合同志的这番话，说得我心里热烘烘的，更加坚定了我保卫毛主席、保卫毛主席无产阶级革命路线的坚强决心。
    去年二月，青海省党内一小撮走资派，勾结反革命分子，掀起了一股反革命逆流，我们“八·一八”战士被打成了“反革命”，遭到了残酷的迫害。这时，我多么想见到亲人门合啊！我坚信“八·一八”的大方向是正确的，门合同志是正确的！
    红太阳的光辉，驱散了乌云。毛主席的声音传遍了整个草原，党中央给“八·一八”平反了！我们“八·一八”战士激动得千遍万遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”五月初，门合同志来到巴仓农场担任支左工作。他见了我就满怀激情地说：“毛主席他老人家给了我们第二次生命，我们要更好地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，紧跟毛主席，永远干革命！”
    九月七日，我正在乡上开会，忽然传来门合同志不幸牺牲的消息。我简直不敢相信自己的耳朵，连忙备马奔向巴仓，想最后看看我们藏族人民的好兄弟。等我赶到农场，门合同志的遗体已经运走了。我呆在门合同志牺牲的现场，心潮翻腾，热泪滚滚。门合啊！你是雪山上的青松，你是草原上的雄鹰，你是我们藏族人民的贴心人哪！是你教我热爱毛主席，是你用毛泽东思想滋润了我这个贫苦牧民的心，是你不断地帮助我懂得了这样一个最深刻的道理：要作革命人，就要无限热爱毛主席，就要无限忠于毛主席革命路线。我下定决心：一定要象你那样，“一切想着毛主席，一切服从毛主席，一切紧跟毛主席，一切为着毛主席。”永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的革命路线！
