Our family's struggle against selfishness and revisionism began as follows:

Following the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions to peasants to also criticize the bourgeoisie, our family's Mao Zedong Thought study class was established in November last year. We have consistently used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon to carry out revolutionary criticism against China's Khrushchev and other capitalist-roaders within the party. When our study class first started, we could manage to struggle against selfishness, but we couldn't criticize revisionism. I pondered this issue. Chairman Mao taught us: "We must struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism." Vice Chairman Lin also issued instructions saying that the struggle against selfishness and the struggle against revisionism "are interrelated. Only by thoroughly struggling against the 'self' can we carry the struggle against revisionism to the end." However, our family study class did not do this. Why?

One day, after dinner, my second son Yun went out to play. I said, "Yun, don't go. Tonight is the family study class activity time. Let's have a preparatory meeting first." His mother asked from the side, "What's the matter that needs a preparatory meeting?" I said, "Our family study class can't criticize revisionism. Let's first expose our 'selfishness'." At the preparatory meeting, no one spoke at first. I took the lead and said, "Our study class can't criticize revisionism. Seventy percent of the responsibility lies with me because I am the leader. Moreover, I don't understand 'criticizing revisionism.' I always think: I am just a peasant, uneducated, how can I criticize effectively?" Everyone heard me expose my thoughts, and they all eagerly followed suit. Yun said, "China's Khrushchev is far away from us. How can we criticize him if he can't hear us?" My wife Guo Fenghua also exposed her thoughts. I said, "This preparatory meeting was very good. Everyone exposed their thoughts. Tonight's study class will solve this problem."

That evening, the whole family sat together. I first had Yun read three quotations from Chairman Mao about criticizing revisionism. Then, I started reminiscing about our hardships. I said: In the old society, we poor people had no way to live! We couldn't eat enough, we couldn't dress warmly, and we lived a miserable life worse than cattle. Thirty-four years ago, your grandfather was driven to death! That autumn, the harvest had not been completed in the fields, and the lackeys from the village public office of the Japanese puppet regime came to our house to extort money, demanding thirty-six silver dollars at once. Who could afford that! Your grandfather said, "I can't afford to pay so much!" The lackey snarled, "Sell your pots and pans, you have to pay! You have three days to pay up." With no other choice, we managed to gather the money and paid. From then on, your grandfather fell ill and never recovered. Before he died, he called me to his side and instructed, "Son, I am done for! Remember how your father died, and never forget this blood debt for generations to come!" Saying this, your grandfather breathed his last. I said this, and the whole family cried. I said, "Don't cry. Let's think, if China's Khrushchev's plot to restore capitalism succeeds, and we poor and lower-middle peasants have to suffer twice, would you agree?" The whole family shouted in unison, "Absolutely not, a thousand times no, ten thousand times no!" I said, "What should we do then?" The eldest son said, "Firmly overthrow China's Khrushchev!" The second son said, "Just overthrowing him is not enough. We must also eliminate his counter-revolutionary revisionist poison!" My wife said, "In short, to prevent a handful of bad elements from succeeding in their plot to restore capitalism, we must carry out revolutionary criticism, thoroughly expose and criticize the tricks of the class enemy, and make them stink worse than dog shit." From then on, our family's revolutionary criticism began.

Conducting family criticism meetings with questions in mind

Our family study class conducts revolutionary criticism mainly through the following method: holding family criticism meetings with specific questions in mind. We study a segment of Chairman Mao's quotations, criticize one of China's Khrushchev's reactionary fallacies, struggle against one manifestation of selfishness in our minds, and eliminate one stream of revisionist poison. Our Dazhai Brigade has gone through the "Four Cleanups" movement, and many people have become complacent and underestimated the enemy, thinking that the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists have been defeated and are now working and laughing with us poor and lower-middle peasants, showing no malicious intent. Our family members also had this complacency, so we held a family criticism meeting with this question in mind.

First, we studied a segment of Chairman Mao's quotations: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not willingly accept their defeat. They will still struggle to the last. Even after the country is pacified, they will continue to sabotage and disrupt in various ways, trying to restore their rule in China every day and every hour. This is inevitable and undeniable. We must never relax our vigilance." Chairman Mao's teachings made the whole family realize that the class enemy will not accept defeat easily. Although they appear obedient, they are full of malice. They are forever the enemies of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Our struggle with these class enemies is a life-and-death class struggle. However, China's Khrushchev falsely claims that "the main class struggle within the country has basically ended." Seizing on this fallacy, the whole family engaged in fierce criticism. The eldest son said, "China's Khrushchev claims that the main class struggle within the country has basically ended, which is complete nonsense. Here, the 'Four Cleanups' movement has just ended, and a rich farmer has already flooded six mu of the brigade's vegetable fields. You want to consolidate the collective economy, but he wants to sabotage it. What is this if not class struggle!" I said, "China's Khrushchev advocates the 'theory of the extinction of class struggle,' aiming to make us unable to distinguish classes and see class struggle, so that the class enemy can freely sabotage and disrupt, ultimately restoring capitalism. Some of us have been deceived without knowing it, which is how dangerous it is!" My wife said, "I was poisoned by the 'theory of the extinction of class struggle.' I always thought that the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists were obedient, speaking and laughing nicely, working hard. In fact, they are all pretenses. They are like a poisonous snake disguised as a beautiful woman, not biting you openly but biting you in secret. Chairman Mao tells us not to relax our vigilance, but I have the complacency of underestimating the enemy, which is the biggest 'selfishness' and the greatest disloyalty to Chairman Mao." Then, I and the two sons also struggled against our complacency and criticized China's Khrushchev's 'theory of the extinction of class struggle.' After the criticism, the whole family vowed to remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forgetting class struggle" and to heighten our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, resolutely fighting against all class enemies.

Criticizing selfishness as soon as it is discovered

Another method our family study class uses to conduct revolutionary criticism is: criticizing as soon as a problem is discovered. When selfishness is found in a family member, it should be helped immediately, and at the same time, revisionism should be criticized. Criticizing at all times and in all matters, resolutely criticizing China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies deeply and thoroughly.

This spring, when the farm work was not too busy, I used the early morning and evening breaks to pick two baskets of manure every day. I thought to myself: These days, I'll work a bit harder, and I can gather at least three carts of manure from last year. This way, I won't worry about the manure for my private plot. As the saying goes, "A crop is like a flower, all thanks to manure." Last year, the private plot yielded little grain, wasn't it because of the lack of manure? Every time I thought of this, my enthusiasm for picking manure increased, and sometimes I even neglected my work. My second daughter Xiuzhen, who was studying in middle school, came home every Saturday. One morning, she saw me picking manure without even eating breakfast and asked, "Father, are you picking manure for the collective or for yourself?" I knew the problem was serious, so I gave a vague answer, "See, where it is needed, there it goes." During dinner, the dining table became a battlefield for struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism. It turned out that the whole family had noticed my selfishness of secretly picking manure for my private plot. While eating, they helped me struggle against my selfishness and fiercely criticized China's Khrushchev's reactionary fallacy of advocating "three selfs and one package." Xiuzhen spoke first, "Father, you put down the collective work and focused on the private plot. This is being poisoned by 'three selfs and one package.' 'Three selfs and one package' is to make the members manage their private plots and small wastelands, developing capitalism. If all the brigade members only care about themselves, won't the collective economy collapse?" My wife said, "'Three selfs and one package' is China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods. We poor and lower-middle peasants cannot do this. A few years ago, we didn't suffer from this? The collective economy is the backbone of the poor and lower-middle peasants. If 'three selfs and one package' is implemented, the collective will be poor, and the poor and lower-middle peasants will suffer." The second son said, "Focusing only on the private plot is being poisoned by 'three selfs and one package,' which is to make the poor and lower-middle peasants go back to the old days, suffer twice, and endure twice the hardships. Father, you cannot forget the past hardships!" I never thought that picking more manure for the private plot was being poisoned by 'three selfs and one package,' which was to go back to the old days. After everyone's help, I received a great education, and my mind opened up. After breakfast, I went to find the brigade leader. I said, "Last winter and this spring, I gathered three carts of manure, originally planning to put them on the private plot. After struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, I realized that I was poisoned by China's Khrushchev's 'three selfs and one package.' I want to donate all three carts of manure to the brigade." After fiercely criticizing the 'three selfs and one package' black goods, the whole family was greatly educated. My wife used to pick manure on the street and, no matter how far, would bring it home; now she doesn't. As soon as she picks manure, she dumps it on the brigade's manure pile. I asked her why she changed, and she said, "For the collective, to produce more grain, and to walk the bright path of socialism."

Overcoming complacency and continuing the struggle

In the family study class, to conduct revolutionary criticism well, we must not only closely combine it with struggling against selfishness but also overcome complacency and carry forward the thorough and decisive revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, deeply and persistently carrying out revolutionary criticism. Recently, we held a family meeting to summarize the experiences and problems of the previous period of revolutionary criticism. Everyone said that the previous period was good, but recently we have become complacent. Everyone felt that we have criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods such as the 'theory of the extinction of class struggle,' 'three selfs and one package,' 'four freedoms,' 'work points in command,' and 'material incentives' quite thoroughly. Aiming at these active thoughts, we repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "In the fields of production struggle and scientific experiment, humanity is constantly developing, and nature is also constantly developing and will never stop at one level. Therefore, humanity must constantly summarize experiences, make discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress. The theory of stagnation, pessimistic theory, and the theory of doing nothing and self-satisfaction are all wrong." The whole family realized that revolutionary criticism is not about doing it thoroughly but about doing it insufficiently. If the family study class relaxes revolutionary criticism, it is relaxing the struggle against a handful of class enemies, which will deviate from the revolutionary struggle's direction. My wife said correctly: "Revolutionary criticism is like fighting a battle. As soon as you relax, the enemy will escape. You must keep fighting until you thoroughly defeat the handful of class enemies!" Overcoming complacency, our family's revolutionary criticism has once again been carried out vigorously.

Our family study class will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, criticize this old evil deeply and thoroughly, overthrow and expose him, and eliminate his poison in all aspects.

    俺家是怎样开展革命大批判的？
    河北省万全县高庙堡公社房子大队贫农社员、活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子　岳忠
    俺家的斗私批修是怎么搞起来的
    遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于农民“也要批判资产阶级”的教导，俺们的毛泽东思想家庭学习班打去年十一月办起来以后，就一直坚持以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，对中国赫鲁晓夫等党内走资派开展了革命的大批判。俺家学习班刚办起来的时候，“斗私”还可以，就是“批修”批不起来。我就思谋这个事儿。毛主席教导说：“要斗私，批修。”林副主席也下了指示说，斗私批修“这两件事情是互相联系的，只有很好地斗掉了‘私’字，才能更好地把反修斗争进行到底。”可是俺们家庭学习班就没有这么做，为啥？
    有一天，吃罢晚饭，二小子进云就忙着去街里玩耍。我说：“进云呀！不要去啦，今儿晚上是家庭学习班的活动时间，咱们先开个预备会。”他娘在一旁问道：“有啥事要开预备会呀？”我说：“咱们家庭学习班批修一直批不起来，咱们都先亮亮这个‘私’。”预备会上起先谁也不吱声，我就带了个头。我说：“咱们学习班批修批不起来，十分责任有七分归我，因为我是组长。再说，我对‘批修’认不清，老思谋着：咱是个种地的大老粗，没有多少文化，咋能批判出名堂呀”！大家一听我亮了活思想，也都抢着要亮。二小子说：“中国赫鲁晓夫离我们老远，咱批判他又听不见。”老伴郭凤花也亮出了活思想。我说：“这个预备会开得挺好，大家都亮了活思想，晚上的学习班就解决这个问题。”
    晚上，一家人围坐在一起，我先叫二小子念了毛主席关于批判修正主义的三条语录。接着，我就给他们忆开苦了。我说：在旧社会里，咱们穷人那有一点活头啊！吃不饱，穿不暖，过着牛马不如的悲惨生活。三十四年前，你爷爷就是被活活逼死的啊！那年秋天，场里还没收打完，日伪村公所里的狗腿子气势汹汹地来咱家敲诈勒索，一张口就要三十六块现大洋。谁给得起呀！你爷爷说：“要这么多，实在交不起呀！”狗腿子恶狠狠地说：“砸锅卖铁，你也得交！限你三天交清。”逼得没办法，只好把钱凑够交了。打这你爷爷就得了病，一直没起身。临死的时候，把我叫到他的跟前，嘱咐说：“孩子，爹是不行啦！你要记住你爹是咋死的，千秋万代，也不要忘记这个血泪仇呀！”说着，你爷爷就咽气了……。我说到这里，全家人都哭了。我说：“不要哭了。咱先想想，要是中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的阴谋得逞了，再叫咱贫下中农吃二遍苦，受二茬罪，你们说行不行呀？”全家人异口同声地说：“一千个不行，一万个不行！”我说：“不行怎么办？”大小子说：“坚决打倒中国赫鲁晓夫！”二小子说：“光打倒他一个人不行，还得肃清他的反革命修正主义流毒！”老伴说：“归根结蒂一句话，要想不叫一小撮坏家伙复辟资本主义的阴谋得逞，就得搞好革命大批判，狠揭狠批阶级敌人的一切阴谋诡计，把他们批得比臭狗屎还要臭。”打这以后，俺家的革命大批判就开展起来了。
    带着问题开家庭批判会
    俺们家庭学习班搞革命大批判，主要的方法是：带着问题召开家庭批判会。学习一段毛主席语录，批判中国赫鲁晓夫一个反动谬论，狠斗头脑里“私”字的一个表现，肃清修正主义一股流毒。俺们房子大队是经过“四清”运动的大队，不少人有了麻痹轻敌思想，认为地富反坏右分子斗得老实了，他们和贫下中农一起劳动，又说又笑，看不出还有啥歹心。俺们家里人也有麻痹轻敌思想，于是带着这个问题召开了一次家庭批判会。
    开始，学习一段毛主席语录：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”毛主席的教导，使全家人认识到，阶级敌人是不甘心失败的，别看他们装的挺老实，其实满肚子绿汤，他们永远是贫下中农的死对头。我们和这一小撮阶级敌人的斗争，是你死我活的阶级斗争。可是中国赫鲁晓夫却胡说什么“国内主要的阶级斗争，已经基本结束了”。抓住这个谬论，全家人进行了激烈的批判。大小子说：“中国赫鲁晓夫说国内主要的阶级斗争，已经基本结束了，这完全是胡说八道。咱们这里‘四清’运动刚结束，一个富农分子就把队里六亩多菜地给淹了。你要巩固集体经济，他却想法破坏。这不是阶级斗争是什么！”我说：“中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹‘阶级斗争熄灭’论，他的目的是要使咱们分不清阶级，看不到阶级斗争，好叫阶级敌人任意破坏和捣乱，最后复辟资本主义。我们有些人上了当还不知道，这是多么危险啊！”老伴说：“我就中了‘阶级斗争熄灭’论的毒。老觉着地富反坏右分子老实了，说话笑咪咪，劳动挺卖劲。其实这都是装的，他们就象一条化装成美女的毒蛇，明着不咬人，暗里就咬你一口。毛主席要我们不要松懈自己的警惕性，可自己就是有麻痹轻敌思想，这是最大的‘私’，是对毛主席最大的不忠。”接着，我和两个小子也斗了麻痹轻敌思想，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论。经过批判，全家人表示今后一定要牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，百倍提高革命警惕性，坚决同一切阶级敌人作斗争。
    发现有“私”就随时批判
    俺们家庭学习班搞革命大批判，另外一个方法就是：发现问题随时批判。在家庭成员中，发现谁有“私”字，就要及时地帮他斗“私”，同时结合着批修。时时批，事事批，坚决把中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义的谬论批深批透。
    今年春天，地里活还不太忙的时候，我利用早晚的空隙，每天要拾两筐粪。我心里思谋着：这些日子，累就累一点吧，连去年攒下的粪，好歹能闹它三车，这下就不愁自留地里的粪了。俗话说：“庄稼一朵花，全靠粪当家。”去年自留地粮食打得少，还不是吃了粪少的亏么！每当我想到这里，拾粪的劲头就更大了，有时连工也误了上。我二丫头秀珍在中学里念书，每个星期六回家。有一天早上她看到我拾粪连饭也顾不得吃，就问道：“爹，你是给集体拾，还是给个人拾呀？”我知道问题闹大了，就说了个囫囵话：“看吧，那里需要往那里下。”吃饭的时候，饭桌就变成了斗私批修的战场。原来全家人都觉察到我偷偷为自留地拾粪的“私”字，一边吃饭一边对我进行帮助，狠狠批判了中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“三自一包”的反动谬论。先是二丫头发言：“爹放下集体活不干，一头扎到自留地里，这是中了‘三自一包’的毒。‘三自一包’就是要叫社员去搞自留地、小片荒，发展资本主义。如果咱们大队的社员都光顾个人，那集体经济还不垮了吗？”老伴说：“‘三自一包’是中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义黑货，咱贫下中农可不能搞。前几年咱不是没吃过这个苦头的。集体经济是贫下中农的靠山，搞了‘三自一包’，集体穷了，还不是苦了贫下中农吗？”二小子说：“光谋自留地就是中了‘三自一包’的毒，就是要咱贫下中农走回头路，吃二遍苦，受二茬罪。爹，你不能忘记过去的苦啊！”说啥我也没想到，多给自留地下点粪就是中了“三自一包”的毒，就是要走回头路。经过大家这一帮助，我受到很大的教育，我的心窍全开了。吃罢早饭，我就去找生产队长。我说：“去冬今春，我攒了三车粪，原来想往自留地里上，经过斗私批修，我才知道自己中了中国赫鲁晓夫的‘三自一包’的流毒。我要把三车粪全部献给队里。”经过狠批“三自一包”的黑货，对全家人教育很大。我的老伴过去在街里拾上粪，不管多远也要送到家里；现在不啦，一拾到粪就倒在队里的粪堆上。我问她怎么变了，她说：“为集体，多打粮，走社会主义光明大道。”
    克服松劲思想，持久地开展下去
    家庭学习班里搞好革命大批判，不仅要紧密地结合斗私，而且还要克服松劲思想，发扬无产阶级坚决彻底的革命精神，深入持久地把革命大批判开展下去。最近，俺们开了一个家庭会，专门总结了前一段革命大批判的经验和问题，大伙都说前段比较好，最近松劲了。大伙觉得“阶级斗争熄灭”论、“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“工分挂帅”、“物质刺激”等反革命修正主义黑货，我们都批判得差不多了。针对这些活思想，俺们反复学习了毛主席的教导：“在生产斗争和科学实验范围内，人类总是不断发展的，自然界也总是不断发展的，永远不会停止在一个水平上。因此，人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。停止的论点，悲观的论点，无所作为和骄傲自满的论点，都是错误的。”全家人认识到，革命大批判不是搞得差不多了，而是还差得很远。家庭学习班如果放松革命的大批判，就是放松对一小撮阶级敌人的斗争，就会离开革命斗争的大方向。老伴说得对：“革命大批判就是打仗。只要一松劲，敌人就会跑了。要不停地打，直到把一小撮阶级敌人彻底打垮！”克服了松劲思想，俺们家的革命大批判又轰轰烈烈地开展起来了。
    我们家庭学习班，一定要高举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，把这个老坏蛋批深批透，斗倒斗臭，肃清他在各个方面的流毒。     　据新华社
