The people's armed forces in the Central Region of South Vietnam, in coordination with battles on various fronts in the South, launched continuous attacks on the enemy in May, achieving tremendous victories.

According to statistics, by May 27, in nearly a month, the people's liberation armed forces in the Central Region had killed, wounded, and captured a total of 16,915 enemy troops, including 7,496 American soldiers. They shot down and destroyed 262 enemy aircraft, destroyed 748 vehicles of various types, demolished 41 cannons and thousands of other weapons, set fire to 33 ammunition depots, fuel storage facilities, and other enemy warehouses, destroyed 50 bunkers and fortified positions, 24 bridges, and hundreds of segments of oil pipelines, and seized a large amount of weapons and military supplies.

The report said that the enemy troops eliminated by the people's liberation armed forces included the complete annihilation of one American armored battalion and 39 companies of American and puppet troops, and the heavy defeat of 7 battalions and 19 companies of American and puppet troops.

The report said that during this period, the military and people of the Central Region attacked nine cities, including Da Nang and Hoi An, as well as 28 military districts, county towns, and towns.

The report said that the people's liberation armed forces also raided many headquarters of American and puppet troops and their lackeys, including 12 command posts from regiment to army level, causing the enemy to suffer heavy losses. They also launched fierce attacks on 17 enemy airfields, 16 artillery positions, and 4 parking lots.

According to a report from the Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi, the people's liberation armed forces in the province of Binh Dinh, South Vietnam, launched a fierce interception of an American aggressor ship convoy on May 27, sinking and damaging 14 American warships, eliminating nearly 1,000 American invaders, and seizing a large amount of weapons and military supplies.

The report said that in the early hours of May 27, American aggressors dispatched B-52 bombers to indiscriminately bomb the village of Long Mai in the district of Ong Chinh, Binh Dinh province. Following this, the enemy dispatched a ship convoy, escorted by jet fighters and helicopters, along the Ong Chinh River towards the villages of Long An and Long Mai, attempting to land in these two villages. The people's liberation armed forces of Binh Dinh province, who were well-prepared, struck the enemy head-on before they could land. After a 15-minute battle, the liberation army sank 10 warships loaded with American troops; another four warships were also hit and caught fire. The remaining four warships fled in disarray.
