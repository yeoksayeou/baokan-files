In the face of the deepening crisis within the imperialist bloc led by the United States and the disintegration of the modern revisionist bloc centered around the Soviet revisionist leadership, the days of the two "hegemons," the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists, have become more difficult than ever. Under these circumstances, their counter-revolutionary global collusion has accelerated: within the short span of a week, from June 12 to 19, they concluded three dirty deals on issues such as "preventing nuclear proliferation"; on June 21, the U.S. imperialist head Johnson personally approved the opening of a direct air route between New York and Moscow.

This speed is unprecedented in the history of U.S.-Soviet collusion; moreover, various signs indicate that both sides are continuing to hasten their collusion and are brewing more deals. This shows that the U.S. imperialists regard the Soviet revisionist traitor clique as their number one ally, pulling them in and using them; while the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique, disregarding the condemnation of the people of the world, is even more brazen and more vigorously pushing the line of betrayal and capitulation to the U.S. against China.

Under the manipulation of the U.S. and the Soviet Union, the United Nations General Assembly on June 12 adopted the so-called "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons" jointly concocted by the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The next day, the U.S. and the Soviet Union exchanged the ratification documents of the first bilateral treaty between the two countries—the U.S.-Soviet Consular Treaty. On June 19, the U.S. and the Soviet Union again manipulated the Security Council to adopt the sinister plan to provide "nuclear protection" for non-nuclear countries.

The U.S. imperialists are highly satisfied with the deals reached with the Soviet revisionist clique. The U.S. imperialist head Johnson took the opportunity to make one speech after another, enthusiastically advocating that the U.S. and the Soviet Union should continue to "move forward in parallel" on the existing basis. He blatantly shouted: the U.S. and the Soviet Union should "negotiate quickly and vigorously," "take many new steps," and "establish new cooperation plans" in any place and at any time where and when we can cooperate, and so on.

Western propaganda machines, in commenting on Johnson's speeches, unanimously pointed out that the Johnson administration is currently making great efforts to pull in the Soviet revisionist leadership. The "Voice of America" radio station's commentary on June 14 said, Johnson "obviously wants to do everything possible" to develop a "reconciliation atmosphere" between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Reuters on June 15 quoted a "political observer" in Washington as saying, "Close relations with Russia have always been one of Johnson's main diplomatic goals," and "Johnson seems to be making a new, serious effort to improve relations with the Soviet Union."

Some Western news agencies also pointed out that Johnson's "appeals" are not "one-sided," and "U.S. officials believe that there are signs that the Russians may now be more willing to respond to this." Indeed, this is the case. Soviet revisionist representatives at the United Nations conference and at the ceremony held in the White House to exchange the ratification documents of the U.S.-Soviet Consular Treaty repeatedly shamelessly "responded" to Johnson's "appeals," loudly advocating U.S.-Soviet "cooperation," saying that the conclusion of the "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons" "clearly proved that countries with different social systems can cooperate within the United Nations framework," the U.S. and the Soviet Union should "cooperate in many fields," and so on. For this reason, the U.S. imperialists do not mind the Soviet revisionist press singing "anti-American" tunes to deceive the Soviet people at home. The U.S. imperialist mouthpiece "Voice of America" radio station once pointed out in a commentary that, in Washington's view, such tunes "do not mean that (in U.S.-Soviet cooperation) further progress will not be made."

In fact, both sides are hastening their further collusion. According to official and semi-official disclosures from the United States, one of the key projects for the next step of U.S.-Soviet collusion will be the so-called "limiting the missile race of anti-ballistic missiles." This is another important step for the U.S. and the Soviet Union to hasten their nuclear collusion and form an anti-China nuclear military alliance under the pretext of "nuclear disarmament." In fact, both sides have long had an understanding on this, and what is needed now is the final agreement, using a treaty or agreement to consolidate their collusion in this regard and to more closely cooperate in their anti-China efforts.

After the United Nations General Assembly adopted the so-called "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons" and the U.S. and the Soviet Union exchanged the ratification documents of the Consular Treaty, U.S. Secretary of State Rusk immediately rushed from Washington to New York on June 14 to host a banquet for Soviet First Deputy Foreign Minister Kuznetsov, who had just completed the above deals and was about to return home, and held a three-hour secret talk. It is reported that they focused on planning the next step of collusion, emphasizing the issue of anti-ballistic missiles. Rusk himself confirmed this at a press conference on June 21, expressing that the United States is willing to "start negotiations as soon as possible" with Soviet representatives on this issue.

Johnson himself, in talking about U.S.-Soviet collusion over the past year or so, almost always mentions this issue, and in recent speeches, he has repeatedly emphasized the need to "strive to reach an agreement that will prevent the U.S. and the Soviet Union from engaging in a costly anti-ballistic missile race." Reuters, in reporting Johnson's speech, pointed out that this is Johnson's "strongest appeal so far" to reach a deal with the Soviet revisionists on this issue.

Through public "dialogue" and backstage collusion, according to U.S. officials, both sides will begin "bilateral negotiations" on this issue as soon as the "disarmament" conference in Geneva resumes in July.

In addition, U.S. State Department officials recently also spread the word that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will soon propose to the Soviet Union the issue of mutual reduction of their troops in Europe. This is a key step in the Johnson administration's counter-revolutionary global strategic deployment plan to move military forces eastward. Due to the continuous defeats in the Vietnam War, the U.S. imperialists are facing a shortage of troops and are eager to reach a major deal with the Soviet revisionists on this issue, so that they can withdraw their troops stationed in Western Europe to Asia to deal with the Vietnamese people, the Chinese people, and the revolutionary people of various countries in Asia.

At present, the world revolutionary situation is excellent. While the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are vigorously developing their anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggles, a great storm of revolutionary mass movements has also risen in Europe and North America, the heart of the capitalist world. The U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists have become ants on a hot pan, facing unprecedented difficulties. They attempt to stabilize their counter-revolutionary front through hastening their collusion and escape the fate of destruction. However, the irresistible tide of revolution will crush them under the wheel of history. Their struggles are all in vain.

    在世界革命风暴的猛烈冲击下加紧勾结相互依靠
    美帝苏修一周内连作三笔肮脏交易
    约翰逊对苏修叛徒迎合美帝表示满意鼓吹双方“建立新的合作计划”
    新华社二十三日讯 本社记者报道：在以美国为首的帝国主义集团内部危机急剧加深，以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义集团日益分崩离析，美帝苏修这两“霸”的日子空前难熬的形势下，它们之间反革命全球勾结的步伐大大加快了：在从六月十二日到十九日的短短一周内，就所谓“防止核扩散”等问题，接连作成了三笔肮脏交易；二十一日，美帝头子约翰逊又亲自批准开辟纽约—莫斯科之间的直达航线。
    这种速度，在美苏勾结史上是前所未有的；而且，种种迹象表明，双方还正在继续加紧勾结，酝酿更多的交易。这说明，美帝把苏修叛徒集团当作了它的头号盟友加以拉拢、使用；而勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团也顾不得世界人民的唾骂，比赫鲁晓夫更加露骨、更加卖力地推行联美反华的叛卖、投降路线。
    在美苏操纵下，联合国大会在六月十二日通过了美苏合伙炮制的所谓“防止核扩散条约”。第二天，美苏交换了两国之间的第一个双边条约——美苏领事条约的批准书。十九日，美苏又操纵安理会通过了所谓为无核国家提供“核保护”的阴谋计划。
    美帝国主义对同苏修集团达成的这几笔交易心满意足。美帝头子约翰逊趁机接二连三地发表谈话，狂热地鼓吹美苏在现有基础上继续“并行前进”。他露骨地叫喊：美苏要“迅速大力地进行谈判”，“采取许多新的步骤”，“在我们能够合作的任何地方和任何时候”“建立新的合作计划”等等。
    西方宣传机器在评述约翰逊的这些讲话时纷纷指出，约翰逊政府目前正在大力拉拢苏修领导集团。“美国之音”电台十四日的评论说，约翰逊“显然想作一切可能作的事情”来发展美苏之间的“和解气氛”。路透社十五日引华盛顿“政治观察家”的话说，“密切同俄国的关系，一直是约翰逊的主要外交目标之一”，“约翰逊似乎正在进行一项新的、认真的努力来改善同苏联的关系”。
    一些西方通讯社还指出，约翰逊的这些“呼吁”并非“一厢情愿”，“美国官员们相信，有迹象表明，俄国人现在可能也更加愿意对此作出响应”。事实正是这样，苏修代表在联合国会议上以及在白宫举行的交换美苏领事条约批准书的仪式上，都一再厚颜无耻地“响应”约翰逊的“呼吁”，大肆鼓吹美苏“合作”，说什么“防止核扩散条约”的搞成，“明显地证明了在联合国范围内，不同社会制度的国家是能够进行合作的”，美苏应该“在许多领域内合作”，等等。正因为如此，美帝对于苏修报刊为了欺骗苏联国内人民而故意唱些“反美”的调调，表示心领神会，并不介意。美帝喉舌“美国之音”电台在一则评论中就曾指出，在华盛顿看来，这种调调“并不意味（在美苏合作方面）不会取得进一步的进展”。
    事实上，双方的进一步勾结正在加紧进行。据美国官方、半官方透露出来的消息表明，美苏下一步勾结的重点项目之一，将是所谓“限制反弹道导弹的导弹竞赛”的问题。这是在“核裁军”的幌子下，美苏加紧核勾结、结成反华核军事同盟的又一个重要步骤。实际上，双方对此早已有所默契，现在需要的是最后拍板成交，用条约或协议的形式来巩固它们之间在这方面的勾结，更密切地配合一致反华。
    在联大通过所谓“防止核扩散条约”以及美苏交换领事条约批准书之后，紧接着，美国国务卿腊斯克就在十四日专程从华盛顿赶到纽约，宴请完成了上述几笔交易即将回国的苏联外交部第一副部长库兹涅佐夫，并密谈了三个小时。据透露，他们在策划下一步的勾结中，着重谈了关于反导弹导弹问题。腊斯克在二十一日的记者招待会上，自己证实了这一点，他表示，美国愿意“尽快”开始同苏修代表谈判这个问题。
    约翰逊自己在近一年多来每谈到美苏勾结时，几乎都要提到这个问题，在最近的几次谈话中，他又一再强调要“争取建立一项将使美苏避免一场耗费巨大的反弹道导弹的导弹竞赛的协议”。路透社在报道约翰逊这一谈话时指出，这是约翰逊为了要同苏修在这个问题上作成一笔交易而发出的“迄今最强烈的呼吁”。
    经过公开的“对话”和幕后的勾结，据美国官方人士透露，双方将在七月份日内瓦“裁军”会议复会时，一开始就要就这个问题举行“双边谈判”。
    此外，美国国务院官员最近还放出风声，北大西洋集团即将向苏联提出关于双方互减它们在欧洲的驻军问题。这是约翰逊政府反革命全球战略部署中军事力量东移计划的一个关键性步骤。美帝国主义由于侵越战争连遭惨败，兵力日趋枯竭，急于在这个问题上同苏修作成一笔重大交易，以便把它在西欧的驻军抽调到亚洲对付越南人民、中国人民和亚洲各国革命人民。
    目前，世界革命形势大好。在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民反帝、反殖斗争蓬勃发展的同时，在欧洲和北美这个资本主义世界的心脏地区，最近也兴起了革命群众运动的伟大风暴。美帝苏修成了热锅上的蚂蚁，面临空前困境。它们妄图通过加紧勾结来稳住它们反革命阵线的阵脚，逃脱覆灭的命运。但是，革命的滚滚洪流是不可抗拒的。它们既然坚持与世界革命人民为敌，它们就终将为历史的巨轮所辗碎。它们的一切挣扎，都是徒劳的。
