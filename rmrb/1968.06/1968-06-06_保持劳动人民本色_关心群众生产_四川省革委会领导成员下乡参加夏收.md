Members of the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Committee, led by Zhang Guohua, the chairman, went to the countryside to participate in the summer harvest the day after the committee was established. This was done in accordance with Chairman Mao's great directive to "be both an 'official' and a common person." They are determined to forever maintain the character of the working people and to forever keep close ties with the broad masses of the people.

On the morning of June 1, the members of the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Committee, carrying their red copies of Chairman Mao's Quotations, rushed to Jinniu People's Commune in the suburbs of Chengdu. Upon arrival, they immediately went to the fields to help the commune members harvest wheat. During rest periods, they studied Chairman Mao's Quotations together. While working, they talked with each other. The leaders of the provincial revolutionary committee learned about the class struggle in the area from the poor and lower-middle peasants. They also listened to the people's demands and expectations for the newly established revolutionary committee. The commune members said: In the past, the capitalist roader Li Jingyuan and his accomplices often stayed in a guesthouse near here, but we never even saw their shadows. One year, when the seedlings in the fields had turned green, he passed through one of the production teams and, because he thought our seedlings were not planted nicely, forced the commune members to uproot and replant them, which greatly affected that year's harvest. Now that the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Committee has just been established, the leaders have taken the time to work and talk with us, which is great. We will definitely support the newly born revolutionary committee with actual actions of seizing the revolution and promoting production to respond to the great leader Chairman Mao's concern for us.

On the night of their return from labor, the leaders of the provincial revolutionary committee heard on the radio the editorial in the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily welcoming the establishment of the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Committee, which conveyed Chairman Mao's latest directive: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." Everyone unanimously expressed their determination to resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's directive and a series of latest directives, to believe in and rely on the masses, to maintain close ties with the masses, to wholeheartedly protect the masses, to listen to the voices of the masses at all times, to forever stand and fight together with the masses, to resolutely smash the rightist reversal wind, to deeply and persistently carry out the revolutionary criticism, to thoroughly expose and criticize the handful of capitalist roaders within the party and their agents in Sichuan, to fight them down and make them stink, to thoroughly smash all the tricks and schemes of the class enemies who try to split the proletarian revolutionary ranks, and to seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

At this crucial moment in seizing the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the rural areas of the Chengdu Plain bravely shouldered the dual burdens of revolution and production, actively participating in the summer harvest and summer planting. This is a scene from the sixth production team of Gaolou Brigade, Qingping People's Commune, Wenchuan County, where the commune members and revolutionary cadres are harvesting rapeseed and planting rice at the same time.

    保持劳动人民本色  关心群众生产
    四川省革委会领导成员下乡参加夏收
    新华社成都二日电　四川省革命委员会的常委们，遵照毛主席“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的伟大教导，在革命委员会成立后的第二天，由省革委会主任张国华同志率领，到农村参加夏收劳动，作为促进思想革命化的一课。他们决心永远保持劳动人民的本色，永远和广大人民群众保持密切的联系。
    六月一日早晨，四川省革命委员会的常委们，带着红彤彤的革命宝书《毛主席语录》，奔赴成都市郊区金牛公社跃进大队。他们到达后，立即下田和社员一起抢收小麦，休息时一起学习毛主席语录。大家边劳动边交谈。省革委会领导成员在劳动中，向贫下中农社员着重了解了当地阶级斗争的情况，并且听取了群众对新诞生的革命委员会的要求和期望。社员群众说：过去，党内走资派李井泉和他的同伙，经常住在离我们这里很近的招待所里，但是我们连他的影子都没见过。有一年田里的秧苗都转青了，他在一个队里路过，嫌我们栽的秧苗不好看，硬逼着社员毁掉重栽，使当年的收成受了很大影响。现在，省革命委员会刚刚成立，领导同志就抽出时间和我们一起劳动、谈心，这太好了。我们一定要以狠抓革命、猛促生产的实际行动，来支持新生的革命委员会，回答伟大领袖毛主席对我们的关怀。
    省革命委员会领导成员劳动归来的当天夜晚，从广播里听到《人民日报》、《解放军报》欢呼四川省革命委员会成立的社论传达了毛主席的最新指示：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”大家一致表示，要坚决执行毛主席的这一指示和一系列最新指示，相信和依靠群众，密切联系群众，满腔热情地保护群众，随时随地倾听群众的呼声，永远和群众团结在一起，战斗在一起，坚决粉碎右倾翻案妖风，深入持久地开展革命大批判，把党内最大一小撮走资派和他们在四川的代理人揭深批透，斗倒斗臭，彻底粉碎阶级敌人妄想分裂无产阶级革命队伍的一切阴谋诡计，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。（附图片）
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，川西平原农村广大贫下中农和革命干部勇敢地挑起革命和生产两副重担，积极投入夏收夏种的战斗。这是温江县清平公社高楼大队第六生产队的社员和革命干部正在边收油菜边栽水稻。　　　新华社记者摄
