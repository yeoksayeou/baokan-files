The revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing No. 7 Middle School, in conjunction with the school's class struggle reality and educational revolution practice, have extensively studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, making the revolutionary criticism more deeply and persistently advance.

According to a report from our newspaper, the revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing No. 7 Middle School have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and focused on the revolutionary criticism. They have adopted methods that combine revolutionary criticism with the school's class struggle reality, revolutionary criticism with the active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, and revolutionary criticism with the educational revolution. This has fully mobilized the initiative and enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary teachers and students, making the revolutionary criticism more deeply and persistently advance.

The broad revolutionary teachers and students of No. 7 Middle School, following Chairman Mao's instructions on "the important task on the ideological front now is to carry out a criticism of revisionism," have persistently carried out revolutionary criticism and continuously achieved victories. However, in the process of carrying out revolutionary criticism, two phenomena emerged: one was that the criticism was rarely linked to the school's class struggle reality; the other was that it only listed a large number of specific materials without raising the analysis and criticism to the level of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. Therefore, the enthusiasm of the masses could not be fully mobilized, and the revolutionary criticism could not be deepened. After discovering this situation, the Revolutionary Committee immediately went deep into the masses, widely listened to the opinions of the masses, and together with the masses, studied and formulated three measures to advance the revolutionary criticism.

To closely link revolutionary criticism with the school's class struggle reality, the No. 7 Revolutionary Committee paid attention to grasping the new trends of the class enemy. They discovered that a small handful of class enemies were still rampantly active within the school, spreading rumors such as "the Revolutionary Committee and the stationed PLA are implementing a new bourgeois reactionary line" and "it's too much." Some class enemies shouted: "My issues can be criticized, but my nature cannot be determined." The Revolutionary Committee analyzed these fallacies and recognized that this small handful of class enemies were engaged in a frenzied rightist reversal campaign, aiming to disrupt the class line and overthrow the newly born Revolutionary Committee. The Revolutionary Committee thoroughly exposed the conspiracies of the class enemies, thereby raising the awareness of class struggle among the broad revolutionary teachers and students. They actively participated in the revolutionary criticism, refuting the reactionary fallacies of this small handful of class enemies to the point where they had no defense.

The Revolutionary Committee also placed the exposed class enemies in the grades and classes, allowing the revolutionary teachers and students to expose and criticize their crimes at any time. Everyone reflected that conducting revolutionary criticism in this way, we can see and touch it, the more we criticize, the more energetic we become.

To closely link revolutionary criticism with the extensive study of Chairman Mao's works, No. 7 Middle School found the form of the "Lecture Team."

The "Lecture Team" is composed mainly of students, with students, teachers, cadres, and the PLA. Under the leadership of the Revolutionary Committee, the "Lecture Team" studies Mao Zedong Thought, propagates Mao Zedong Thought; criticizes China's Khrushchev, criticizes the school's capitalist roaders, traitors, and spies. Before each thematic criticism, the entire school's "Lecture Team" studies together Chairman Mao's relevant works and quotations, jointly drafts the lecture outline, and goes deep into the classes, using the five comparisons method to thoroughly explain the thematic criticism. The five comparisons method is: how Chairman Mao instructs, how China's Khrushchev poisons, how the old Municipal Party Committee's capitalist roaders implement, how the school's capitalist roaders do, and how I see it. Through the lectures, revolutionary teachers and students further grasped the powerful weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, clarifying the content and focus of what needs to be criticized. Therefore, after each lecture, a wave of revolutionary criticism would emerge. This way, even newly enrolled students could actively participate in the revolutionary criticism.

Since May, No. 7 Middle School has used the "Lecture Team" method to mobilize the broad revolutionary teachers and students to criticize the rightist reversal wind blown by the class enemies, criticize China's Khrushchev's theory of "the extinction of class struggle" and the fallacies of the school's capitalist roaders; criticize the traitorous philosophy of the small handful of the biggest capitalist roaders within the Party, and also criticize the reactionary views of the school's capitalist roaders: "surrendering is not betrayal." The broad revolutionary teachers and students each time study one viewpoint of Chairman Mao, criticize one fallacy of China's Khrushchev, and eliminate its poison spread in the school. Each criticism meeting further raised the awareness of class struggle and the consciousness of the struggle between the two lines among the broad revolutionary teachers and students.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating our schools can no longer continue."

The broad revolutionary teachers and students of No. 7 Middle School, following Chairman Mao's instructions, closely linked revolutionary criticism with the educational revolution. They turned the classroom into a battlefield for revolutionary criticism, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to criticize China's Khrushchev and his agents' promotion of "business first," "grades first," and other revisionist black goods, and to expose their heinous crimes of poisoning students. The broad revolutionary teachers and students also used Chairman Mao's thoughts on educational revolution as a weapon to write big-character posters to criticize the old language textbooks. At that time, some teachers were not interested in criticizing the old language courses, saying things like: language is language, it should have its own characteristics, it should focus on its words, sentences, and structure. Revolutionary teachers and students pointed out in a penetrating manner that this argument is a purely professional viewpoint, a manifestation of not emphasizing proletarian politics, and essentially the poison of the revisionist educational line has not been eliminated.

The broad revolutionary teachers and students also actively guided the new students to participate in the revolutionary criticism, speaking to the new students about Mao Zedong Thought, the situation of class struggle, and the history of the school's struggle between the two lines, making the broad new students actively participate in the practical struggle of the educational revolution.

    密切联系实际推进革命大批判
    北京第七中学革命师生，结合本校的阶级斗争实际和教育革命实践，大学大用毛泽东思想，使革命大批判更加深入持久地向前发展
    本报讯　北京市第七中学的革命师生，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓革命大批判。他们采取革命大批判和本校阶级斗争实际相结合，革命大批判和活学活用毛泽东思想相结合，革命大批判和教育革命相结合的方法，充分调动了广大革命师生的主动性和积极性，使革命大批判更加深入持久地向前发展。
    七中广大革命师生，遵照毛主席关于“现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判”的教导，持久地开展革命大批判，不断取得胜利。但是，在开展革命大批判的过程中，出现了两种现象：一种是批判很少联系本校的阶级斗争实际；另一种是只罗列一大堆具体材料，没有提高到阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的高度上来分析批判。因此，群众的积极性不能充分调动起来，革命大批判深入不下去。革委会发现这种情况后，马上深入到群众中去，广泛听取群众意见，和群众一起研究，订出了推进革命大批判的三项措施。大批判和本校阶级斗争相结合
    为了把革命大批判和本校阶级斗争实际紧密结合起来，七中革委会注意掌握阶级敌人的新动向。他们发现，校内一小撮阶级敌人还在猖狂进行活动，胡说什么“革委会和驻校解放军执行新的资产阶级反动路线”，
  “太过火了”。有的阶级敌人叫嚷：“我的问题批判可以，定性还不成。”革委会同志分析了这些谬论，认识到这是一小撮阶级敌人在猖狂进行右倾翻案活动，其目的是妄图搅乱阶级阵线和搞垮新生的革委会。革委会彻底揭发了阶级敌人的阴谋活动，从而提高了广大革命师生对敌斗争观念，他们积极参加革命大批判，把这一小撮阶级敌人的反动谬论批驳得体无完肤。
    革委会并且把揭露出来的阶级敌人放到年级和教学班，让革命师生随时随地揭发和批判他们的罪行。大家反映：这样搞革命大批判，我们看得见，摸得着，越批越有劲。
    大批判和大学习相结合
    为了把革命大批判和大学毛主席著作密切结合起来，七中找到了“宣讲团”的形式。
  “宣讲团”以学生为主，由学生、教师、干部和解放军组成。“宣讲团”在革委会的领导下，学习毛泽东思想，宣传毛泽东思想；批判中国赫鲁晓夫，批判本校的走资派、叛徒和特务。在每次专题批判前，全校“宣讲团”一起学习毛主席有关著作和语录，共同拟定宣讲提纲，深入各教学班，用五对照的方法，把所要批判的专题讲深讲透。五对照的方法是：毛主席是怎样教导的，中国赫鲁晓夫是怎样放毒的，旧市委内走资派是怎样推行的，本校走资派是怎样干的，自己是怎样看的。通过宣讲，革命师生进一步掌握了毛泽东思想这个威力无比的武器，弄清楚了要批判的内容和重点。所以每次宣讲后，都出现了革命大批判热潮。这样做，即使刚刚入校的新生都能积极地投入革命大批判。
    五月份以来，七中运用“宣讲团”的方式，发动广大革命师生批判了阶级敌人刮起的右倾翻案妖风，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论和校内走资派的谬论；批判了党内一小撮最大的走资派的叛徒哲学，也批判了本校走资派的反动观点：“自首不是叛变”。广大革命师生每次学习毛主席一个观点，批判中国赫鲁晓夫一条谬论，肃清其散布在学校的流毒。每一次批判会，都进一步提高了广大革命师生的阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争的觉悟。
  大批判和教育革命相结合
    毛主席教导我们：“学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。”
    七中广大革命师生遵照毛主席的教导，把革命大批判和教育革命紧密地结合起来。他们把课堂变成革命大批判的“战场”，用毛泽东思想为武器，批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行的“业务挂帅”、“分数第一”等等修正主义黑货，控诉他们毒害学生的滔天罪行。广大革命师生还以毛主席关于教育革命的思想为武器，写大字报对旧语文教材进行全面批判。当时，有的教师对批判旧语文课不感兴趣，说什么：语文嘛，就要有语文的特点，就要讲究它的字、词、句和篇章、结构。革命师生一针见血地指出，这种论调是单纯业务观点，这是不突出无产阶级政治的表现，实质上是修正主义教育路线的流毒还没有肃清。
    广大革命师生还积极引导新生参加革命大批判，向新生大讲毛泽东思想，大讲阶级斗争的形势，大讲学校的两条路线斗争的历史，使广大新生积极地投入到教育革命的实际斗争中来。
