The wave of student struggles in Italy, which has rapidly spread nationwide in support of French workers and students and against the reactionary rule of the domestic monopoly bourgeoisie, has developed swiftly. It has expanded from Rome to major cities such as Turin, Naples, Florence, and Milan. Thousands of students have held demonstrations, occupied schools, and engaged in fierce battles with the police sent by the reactionary authorities.

On May 31, students at the University of Rome occupied the school and held a meeting in a large lecture hall. Many speakers expressed strong support for the just struggle of French workers and students. They also sharply condemned the treacherous actions of the Soviet revisionists and French revisionists in betraying the interests of the French people. A resolution passed at the meeting pointed out that the Soviet revisionists and French revisionists "openly collude with bourgeois forces, attempting to suppress the massive strike and occupation movement unfolding in France," and are trying to "separate the student movement from the workers' movement."

On June 1, reactionary authorities instigated some hooligan students to forcibly enter the literature department of the University of Rome, which was occupied by progressive students. They were driven back by the progressive students using fists and stones. About a thousand progressive students then set up barricades at the entrances of various buildings within the university campus, preparing to fight to the end. They also posted slogans such as "Students and workers arm yourselves" and raised red flags on the main building and various department buildings they controlled. On June 2, the progressive students unanimously decided to "continue occupying the school indefinitely."

In the northern Italian city of Turin, progressive students bravely resisted police brutality twice on June 1. Demonstrating students attacked the police with stones and overturned cars to use as barricades in their fight against the police, which continued until the early hours of June 2.

Over a thousand progressive students in Naples occupied a local university on June 1 and held a march and demonstration in the city center, shouting slogans in support of French students and workers.

At the University of Florence, students had already occupied classrooms on May 31. On June 1, they also occupied the dean's office. Students expressed their intention to support the struggle of French workers and students through their actions.

The dean's office at the University of Milan was also occupied by students. Additionally, artists in Milan occupied the Milan Art Exhibition.

Faced with the rapidly expanding wave of revolutionary mass struggles, the Italian reactionary ruling class is terrified, hurriedly ordering reserve police to Rome to suppress the movement. Reactionary bourgeois newspapers exclaimed that this is one of the most serious events to occur in Italy this year.

In Rome, thousands of students, taking French students as an example, took revolutionary mass actions, bravely occupying the University of Rome, and engaged in a fierce struggle with reactionary police and right-wing students outside the school gates, enthusiastically supporting and standing with the just struggle of the French people.

    以战斗的行动支持法国的工人和学生
    意大利学生斗争浪潮迅速扩展到全国
    学生们举行示威，占领学校，设置路障，同反动军警搏斗，反动统治集团怕得要命
    据新华社二日讯　罗马消息：意大利学生为声援法国工人和学生、反对本国垄断资产阶级反动统治而掀起的斗争迅速发展，已经从罗马扩展到都灵、那不勒斯、佛罗伦萨和米兰等各大城市。数以千计的学生举行示威，占领学校，并且同反动当局派出的警察进行英勇的搏斗。
    罗马大学学生五月三十一日占领学校以后，在一个大讲堂里举行了集会。许多发言者表示热烈支持法国工人和学生的正义斗争。他们还尖锐地谴责了苏修和法修出卖法国人民利益的卑鄙行径。会上通过的决议指出，苏修和法修“公开勾结资产阶级势力，企图遏制在法国展开的声势浩大的罢工和占领运动”，并且“企图使学生运动同工人运动割裂开来”。
    一日，反动当局指使一些流氓学生，企图强行进入进步学生占领的罗马大学文学系，被进步学生用拳头和石块击退。大约一千名进步学生随即在大学校园内各大楼的入口处设置了路障，准备坚持斗争到底。他们还贴出了“学生和工人武装起来”的标语，并且在他们所控制的主楼和各系的楼房上升起了红旗。二日，进步学生们一致决定“无限期继续占领学校”。
    在意大利北部大城市都灵，进步学生一日两次英勇抗击警察的野蛮镇压。示威学生用石块袭击警察，并且翻倒汽车作为街垒与警察搏斗，斗争持续到二日凌晨。
    那不勒斯的一千多名进步学生一日占领了当地的一所大学，并在市中心举行游行示威，高呼支持法国学生和工人的口号。
    在佛罗伦萨大学，学生已于五月三十一日占领学校教室。一日，学生又占领了校长办公室。学生表示要用自己的行动声援法国工人和学生的斗争。
    米兰大学的校长办公室也被学生占领。此外，米兰的艺术家们还占领米兰艺术展览会。
    面对着迅速扩展的群众性革命斗争浪潮，意大利反动统治集团怕得要命，慌忙下令调后备警察去罗马镇压。资产阶级反动报刊惊呼这是今年意大利发生的最严重的事件之一。（附图片）
    意大利罗马数千名学生以法国学生为榜样，采取了群众性的革命行动，奋起占领罗马大学，并同校门外的反动警察和右派学生进行英勇斗争，热烈声援和支持法国人民的正义斗争。
