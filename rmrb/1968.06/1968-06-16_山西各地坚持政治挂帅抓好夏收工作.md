In the brilliant light of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the revolutionary and production situation in the rural areas of Shanxi Province is excellent. The province's 1,400 million mu of wheat, from south to north, is ripening in succession. The main wheat-producing areas of Jinan Plain have already begun harvesting the new wheat, and the rural areas are bustling with joy and activity.

The biggest feature of Shanxi Province's summer harvest work this year is the emphasis on proletarian politics, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide the summer harvest. The wheat is harvested quickly and well. Various levels of leadership have insisted on political leadership, starting from promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking, and have done a good job in summer harvest work. In mid-May, the Shanxi Revolutionary Committee issued instructions to the entire province to further implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" and do a good job in summer harvest work. Recently, the provincial revolutionary committee also held a provincial summer harvest work conference and made specific arrangements for the summer harvest work.

The broad masses of community members have displayed the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day" and have thrown themselves into summer harvest labor. As soon as it is dawn, they hold high portraits of Chairman Mao and placards with quotations from Chairman Mao, sing "The East Is Red," and head to the golden wheat fields to harvest the wheat. During rest periods, they hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes and criticism meetings in the fields, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to thoroughly criticize and denounce the revisionist black goods of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, such as the "three freedoms and one contract," "four freedoms," "work points in command," and the theory of "class struggle extinction." They treat the summer harvest as a political battle, achieving timely harvesting, precise collection, and ensuring that every grain is stored.

The Shanxi Provincial Military Region of the People's Liberation Army and the troops stationed in Shanxi have dispatched large numbers of soldiers to form Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, rushing to the front lines of wheat harvesting to actively support the summer harvest.

    山西各地坚持政治挂帅抓好夏收工作
    据新华社太原十五日电　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下，山西省广大农村革命、生产形势一片大好。全省一千四百多万亩小麦，由南到北陆续黄熟，主要产麦区晋南平川，已经开镰喜收新麦，广大农村呈现出一片喜气洋洋的繁忙景象。
    今年山西省夏收工作的最大特点，是突出无产阶级政治，用毛泽东思想统帅夏收，麦子收得快，收得好。各级领导班子，坚持政治挂帅，从促进人的思想革命化入手，抓好夏收工作。山西省革命委员会在五月中旬就向全省发出了进一步贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，搞好夏收工作的指示，不久前，省革委会又召开全省夏收工作会议，对夏收工作做了具体部署。
    广大社员群众发扬“只争朝夕”的革命精神，投入夏收劳动。天刚蒙蒙亮，他们就高举毛主席画像和毛主席语录牌，高唱《东方红》，走向金黄的麦田收割小麦。在休息时间，他们举办田间毛泽东思想学习班和地头批判会，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，狠揭狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“工分挂帅”、“阶级斗争熄灭”论等反革命修正主义黑货。他们把夏收当作一场政治仗来打，做到了随熟随割，精收细打，颗粒归仓。
    人民解放军山西省军区和驻山西部队，派出大批指战员组成毛泽东思想宣传队，奔赴麦收第一线，积极支援夏收。
