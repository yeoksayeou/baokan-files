The "Commemorating Norman Bethune Exhibition" held by the leadership of the Beijing Military Region of the People's Liberation Army closed on June 21 in Beijing.

The "Commemorating Norman Bethune Exhibition" was officially displayed on December 21, 1967, at the Nationalities Culture Palace in the capital, on the 28th anniversary of the publication of the great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant work "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Over the past six months, it has received workers from Beijing and various parts of the country, members of rural people's communes, PLA soldiers and officers, Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, as well as compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao, returned overseas Chinese, and international friends, totaling one million people. Many viewers visited the exhibition multiple times. They enthusiastically praised this exhibition as a good classroom for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. A Red Guard wrote in the comment book that the exhibition "made us vividly understand what a great communist warrior is and what a great internationalist warrior is. It has made the 'Three Articles' vivid, giving us a profound lesson in Mao Zedong Thought."

Great leader Chairman Mao taught in "In Memory of Norman Bethune": "We all should learn from his spirit of selflessness." Many viewers, during their visit, linked their experiences in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, deeply feeling that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the line of serving the public; the counter-revolutionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev is the line of serving the self. They expressed their determination to learn from Comrade Norman Bethune's spirit of "selflessness," to fight against the bourgeois "self," to promote the proletarian "public," to adhere to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. A school with two revolutionary factions came to visit the exhibition with questions about achieving revolutionary unity. After the visit, they immediately held a self-criticism meeting, each making self-criticisms. Soon, they achieved revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination based on the principles of Mao Zedong Thought. They said: We should be like Comrade Norman Bethune, "selfless," fighting away all selfishness, closely following the great leader Chairman Mao, and carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

Many revolutionary masses were deeply moved by Comrade Norman Bethune's spirit of "having no selfish motives, regarding the liberation of the Chinese people as his own cause" and his "extreme responsibility to work, extreme enthusiasm for comrades and the people" internationalist and communist spirit. Some young intellectuals supporting the construction of the border, after visiting the exhibition, became more determined to wholeheartedly serve the people on the border. They rushed to their glorious posts with fighting enthusiasm. Several medical workers from Hong Kong and Macao who had just graduated from school expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, take Comrade Norman Bethune as an example, and wholeheartedly serve the broad laboring people. Medical staff from the General Hospital of the PLA, after seeing Comrade Norman Bethune's moving deeds of loving the people, solemnly swore in front of the great leader Chairman Mao's portrait: They would definitely follow Chairman Mao's words, learn from the great communist warrior Comrade Norman Bethune, go to the countryside, go to the border, go to where the people need the most, go to the fiery struggle, and serve the people for life. After the visit, they immediately organized a medical team to go to the high-altitude and cold regions of Inner Mongolia's Baiyin Kulun Military Horse Farm, deeply into the herdsmen, enthusiastically propagating Mao Zedong Thought, and bringing medical treatment and medicine to the doorstep. The herdsmen were deeply moved by the medical workers' wholehearted service to the people according to Chairman Mao's teachings, and they shouted over and over again: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" A work team assisting the construction of African people specially came to visit the exhibition before going abroad. Comrade Norman Bethune's brilliant deeds greatly inspired them, and everyone firmly expressed their determination to forever be loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, learn from Comrade Norman Bethune's internationalist and communist spirit, and wholeheartedly serve the African people.

The exhibition of Comrade Norman Bethune's deeds of seriously studying and striving to master Mao Zedong Thought greatly educated the viewers and left a deep impression. Many active learners of Chairman Mao's works and revolutionary masses of the PLA, after visiting the exhibition, all expressed their determination to more consciously study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, use Mao Zedong Thought to reform themselves, and struggle for the proletarian revolutionary cause for life.

During the exhibition period, the exhibition received enthusiastic support and assistance from the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee and revolutionary factions from all over the country. The leadership of the Beijing Military Region has currently assisted in replicating more than 40 sets of exhibits and sent them to Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Chengdu, Jinan, and other places for display.

    活学活用毛泽东思想的好课堂
    “纪念白求恩展览”在京闭幕，百万观众受到了深刻教育
    广大革命群众表示更好地用毛泽东思想改造自己，为无产阶级革命事业奋斗终生
    新华社二十四日讯　人民解放军北京部队领导机关举办的“纪念白求恩展览”，已于二十一日在北京闭幕。
   “纪念白求恩展览”，是在伟大领袖毛主席的光辉著作《纪念白求恩》发表二十八周年的日子——一九六七年十二月二十一日，在首都民族文化宫正式展出的。六个月来，共接待了北京和全国各地的工人、农村人民公社社员、解放军指战员、红卫兵小将、革命干部、革命群众，以及港澳同胞、归国华侨和国际友人共一百万人前来参观。许多观众参观了一遍又一遍，他们热烈称赞这个展览是活学活用毛泽东思想的好课堂。一位红卫兵小将在留言簿上写道，这个展览“使我们更生动地体会到了什么叫伟大的共产主义战士，什么叫伟大的国际主义战士。它把‘老三篇’形象化了，使我们上了一堂深刻的毛泽东思想教育课。”
    伟大领袖毛主席在《纪念白求恩》中教导说：“我们大家要学习他毫无自私自利之心的精神。”很多观众在参观中，联系自己在无产阶级文化大革命中的斗争实践，深深体会到，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线就是为公的路线；中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线就是为私的路线。他们表示一定要学习白求恩同志的“毫无自私自利之心”，斗倒资产阶级的“私”字，发扬无产阶级的“公”字，坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。有一个学校的两派革命群众带着实现革命大联合中的思想问题前来参观，参观后当场开了斗私会，各自作了自我批评，不久就在毛泽东思想的原则基础上实现了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。他们说：我们要象白求恩同志那样，“毫无自私自利之心”，把私心斗得“毫无”，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    许多革命群众在参观中，深深为白求恩同志“毫无利己的动机，把中国人民的解放事业当作他自己的事业”和“对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱”的国际主义精神和共产主义精神所感动。一些支援边疆建设的知识青年，参观展览后更加坚定了全心全意在边疆为人民服务的决心，他们满怀战斗豪情，愉快地奔赴光荣的战斗岗位。来自港澳的几位刚从学校毕业的医务工作者，参观展览后激动地表示，决心遵照毛主席的教导，以白求恩同志为榜样，全心全意为广大劳动人民服务。解放军总医院的医护人员，看了白求恩同志热爱人民群众的动人事迹，在伟大领袖毛主席像前庄严宣誓：一定要听毛主席的话，向伟大的共产主义战士白求恩同志学习，到农村，到边疆，到群众最需要的地方，到火热的斗争中去，为人民服务一辈子。他们在参观后，立即组织医疗队前往内蒙古高寒地区的白银库伦军马场，深入到牧工当中，热情地宣传毛泽东思想，送医送药上门。牧工们对医务工作者遵照毛主席的教导全心全意为人民服务非常感动，他们一遍又一遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”一个援助非洲人民建设的工作队，在出国前专门来参观了展览。白求恩同志的光辉事迹使他们受到很大鼓舞，大家坚决表示要永远忠于伟大领袖毛主席，学习白求恩同志的国际主义精神和共产主义精神，全心全意为非洲人民服务。
    这个展览展出的白求恩同志认真学习和努力掌握毛泽东思想的事迹，使观众受到很大教育，留下了深刻的印象。人民解放军许多学习毛主席著作积极分子和广大革命群众看了展览，都表示要更加自觉地活学活用毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想改造自己，为无产阶级革命事业奋斗终生。
      “纪念白求恩展览”展出期间，得到了北京市革命委员会和全国各地无产阶级革命派的热情支持和协助。北京部队领导机关目前已协助全国各地复制了四十多套展品，送往上海、天津、沈阳、成都、济南等地展出。
