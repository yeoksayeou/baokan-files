Revolutionary workers in Jinan Railway Bureau firmly use Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything. The revolution is thriving, and production is continuously improving. The revolutionary criticism is carried out in depth and over a long period, and the main transportation production indicators are rising sharply every month.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, June 18th: The revolutionary workers of Jinan Railway Bureau, with the enthusiastic help of the People's Liberation Army, are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and focusing on the revolution and vigorously promoting production. Our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao's warm reception of the representatives attending the National Railway and Transportation Conference has given them great encouragement and motivation. At present, the revolutionary workers of the entire bureau are spirited, the revolutionary criticism is thriving, and the main transportation production indicators are rising sharply every month. In May of this year, the daily car loading volume increased by 7.1% compared to April and by 41% compared to January. Other production indicators have also exceeded the state plan. In the first ten days of June, the daily car loading volume increased by 11.8% compared to the first ten days of May.

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has brought about earth-shaking changes in Jinan Railway Bureau. Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line have never been so deeply rooted in people's hearts as they are today. From the offices to the stations and freight yards, Mao Zedong Thought study classes are becoming more and more prevalent and better organized. The entire bureau has had over 35,000 people participate in these study sessions. Revolutionary workers read Chairman Mao's books every day and firmly use Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything. They actively propagate Mao Zedong Thought, showing slides in waiting rooms and on trains, performing revolutionary programs, organizing study classes, and holding criticism meetings, turning waiting rooms and carriages into classrooms for studying Mao Zedong Thought and battlefields for criticizing and repudiating oneself and revisionism.

The revolutionary workers of Jinan Railway Bureau, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle," have carried out a deep and sustained revolutionary criticism. They use various forms to severely criticize the revisionist goods promoted by China's Khrushchev and his agents in the railway sector, firmly establish Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and launch mass movements, fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the revolutionary masses. The railway between Jinan and Tai'an has a significant slope. In the past, the capitalist roaders only believed in the revisionist and bourgeois "experts," and trains climbing the slope had to use two locomotives, pulling only 2,000 tons. Now, the revolutionary cadres of Jinan Locomotive Depot have taken power, fully mobilized the masses, conducted scientific experiments, and broken the old rules set by bourgeois technical "authorities," using only one locomotive to pull 2,500 tons. The crew of locomotive 5446 at Zhangdian Locomotive Depot, following Chairman Mao's great teaching of "saving every penny for the war and revolutionary cause," have diligently carried out coal-saving activities. Since last year, they have saved 68 tons of coal over 14 consecutive months.

In the past, the revolutionary workers of Jinan Railway Bureau, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "serving the people wholeheartedly," created the good experience of integrating passenger and freight services, but this was ruthlessly obstructed and destroyed by the capitalist roaders within the party. During the Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers overthrew the capitalist roaders, broke down the old frameworks and foreign rules, and established the thought of serving the people completely and thoroughly. With the support and cooperation of relevant departments, they restored and developed the good experience of actively serving brother enterprises and revolutionary travelers. Currently, over 50 freight stations in the entire bureau have launched joint freight services, linking the work of railways, highways, waterways, loading and unloading, banks, and material production and management units, handling procedures for each other, eliminating unreasonable transfer links, greatly facilitating the consigning units, and accelerating the turnover of goods, reducing losses. In passenger services, they also try to solve problems related to train, bus, and ship tickets for travelers in one place during a single trip. This bureau has a large coal transportation task. Many revolutionary workers have gone deep into the mining areas, investigated and studied the problems in coal transportation, overcome numerous difficulties, organized car deliveries according to the mining area's loading conditions, and basically ensured that the amount of coal produced is the amount transported by trains, thus gaining the praise of coal-producing and coal-using units.

    广大革命职工坚决用毛泽东思想统帅一切
    济南铁路局革命轰轰烈烈生产不断提高
    深入持久地开展了革命大批判，主要运输生产指标逐月大幅度上升
    据新华社济南十八日电　济南铁路局广大革命职工，在人民解放军的热情帮助下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓革命，猛促生产。我们伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席亲切接见出席全国铁路、交通会议的代表，更给了他们巨大的鼓舞和鞭策。目前，全局广大革命职工精神振奋，革命大批判轰轰烈烈，主要运输生产指标逐月大幅度上升。今年五月份的日装车数比四月份增长百分之七点一，比一月份增长百分之四十一，其他生产指标也超额完成了国家计划，六月上旬，日装车数又比五月上旬提高百分之十一点八。
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，使济南铁路局发生了天翻地覆的变化，毛泽东思想和毛主席的革命路线从来没有象今天这样深入人心。从机关到车站、货场，毛泽东思想学习班越办越多，越办越好，全局已有三万五千多人次参加了学习。广大革命职工天天读毛主席的书，坚决用毛泽东思想统帅一切。他们积极宣传毛泽东思想，在候车室、在列车上放幻灯，演革命节目，办学习班，开批判会，把候车室和车厢办成了学习毛泽东思想的课堂和斗私批修的战场。
    济南铁路局广大革命职工遵照伟大领袖毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，深入持久地开展了革命大批判。他们利用各种形式狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在铁路方面的代理人所推行的修正主义黑货，大立毛主席的革命路线，大搞群众运动，充分发挥了革命群众的积极性。济南、泰安间铁路坡度较大，过去走资派只相信修正主义和资产阶级“专家”的一套，列车爬坡一定要用两台机车，而且只牵引两千吨，现在，济南机务段无产阶级革命派掌了权，充分发动群众，进行科学试验，打破了资产阶级技术“权威”规定的陈规旧矩，只用一台机车就可以牵引两千五百吨。张店机务段5446机车乘务组的同志们，按照毛主席“节省每一个铜板为着战争和革命事业”的伟大教导，认真开展节约用煤活动，自去年以来，连续十四个月节约煤炭共六十八吨。
    过去，济南铁路局的广大革命职工按照毛主席“全心全意地为人民服务”的教导，曾创造出客货运输服务一条线的好经验，但却遭到党内走资派的蛮横阻挠和破坏。在文化大革命中，广大革命职工斗倒了走资派，大破了旧框框、洋条条，大立了完全彻底为人民服务的思想，在有关部门的支持配合下，重新恢复和发展了主动为兄弟企业单位和革命旅客服务的好经验。目前，全局已有五十多个货运站，开展了货运联合服务，把铁路、公路、航运、搬运、银行、物资生产和管理单位的工作，环环相扣，互相代办手续，消除了不合理的中转环节，大大方便了托运单位，并使货物加速了运转，减少了损耗。在客运方面，他们也尽可能做到让旅客在一次旅行中需要换乘的火车、汽车、轮船票证等问题在一个地方得到解决。这个局的运煤任务较大，许多革命职工深入矿区，调查研究煤炭运输上的问题，克服重重困难，按矿区装车条件，组织送车，基本上做到了煤矿产多少，火车就运出多少，因而获得了产煤和用煤单位的赞扬。
