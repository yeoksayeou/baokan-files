Every victory of our Party is inseparable from the active development of the struggle between the two lines within the Party.

However, another major capitalist-roader within the Party, just like the Chinese Khrushchev, is terrified and hates the struggle between the two lines within the Party to the core. He maliciously slanders our Party's struggle between the two lines as "nothing more than one group overthrowing another," "resulting in the dispersal of revolutionary forces," "greatly weakening combat effectiveness," and "unable to unite," and so on. These counter-revolutionary, shameless lies completely expose the hideous face of this counter-revolutionary revisionist.

As early as 1937, Chairman Mao pointed out: "Different thoughts and struggles within the Party are constantly occurring. This is the reflection of class contradictions and the contradictions between new and old things in society within the Party. If there are no contradictions and struggles to resolve contradictions within the Party, the life of the Party will also cease." The facts completely prove Chairman Mao's wise judgment. In the history of our Party, whether it was the struggle against "Left" opportunism, the struggle against Right opportunism, or the current struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party led by the Chinese Khrushchev, they are all reflections of the struggle between the two classes and the two roads in society within the Party.

A handful of traitors, spies, counter-revolutionaries, and stubborn capitalist-roaders who have infiltrated our Party are the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries and the most dangerous "time bombs." Once the time is ripe, they will seize power. Their struggle with us is a struggle to the death. Therefore, we must undoubtedly use ruthless struggle or merciless blows against these reactionaries, because those bad elements are using these methods against the Party. If we still tolerate them, we will fall right into the trap of the bad elements. Only by thoroughly eliminating these "time bombs" can we truly purify the Party's organization, strengthen the unity of the Party on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, enhance the Party's combat effectiveness, ensure the implementation of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and ensure that our Party and country will never change color.

The major capitalist-roader within the Party so maliciously attacks and opposes the struggle between the two lines within the Party, aiming to sabotage the Party's unity and solidarity, usurp the Party's leadership, and doom the Party to death. He allows the bourgeoisie and revisionism to attack the Party but does not allow the Party to lead the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses to counterattack them. He crazily shouts, "If one group can overthrow another group, then can't another group rise up to overthrow this group?" How vicious! How reactionary! This is how he openly incites those traitors, spies, stubborn capitalist-roaders, and counter-revolutionary two-faced individuals to overthrow the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao.

"In the Communist Party of a socialist country, it is inevitable that there will be a struggle between Marxism-Leninism and various opportunisms, mainly revisionism." This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has made us deeply realize that as long as there is still a struggle between the two classes and the two roads in society, there will inevitably be a struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line and the bourgeois reactionary line within the Party. The closer the revolution is to overall victory, the more fiercely the class enemies will struggle to the death. The struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines will be more complex and sharper. We communists and revolutionary fighters must raise our awareness of class struggle and line struggle, firmly grasp class struggle, firmly grasp line struggle, and carry out the class struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie to the end!

    狠抓阶级斗争和路线斗争

    我们党的每一个胜利，都是和积极开展党内两条路线斗争分不开的。
    但是，党内另一个最大的走资派和中国赫鲁晓夫一样，对开展党内路线斗争怕得要死，恨得要命。他恶毒地污蔑我们党内的路线斗争“无非是这一批人打倒了，另一批人起来了”，“结果是革命力量涣散”，“战斗力大伤”，“团结不起来”，等等。这些反革命的无耻谰言，完全暴露了这个反革命修正主义分子的狰狞面目。
    毛主席早在一九三七年就指出：“党内不同思想的对立和斗争是经常发生的，这是社会的阶级矛盾和新旧事物的矛盾在党内的反映。党内如果没有矛盾和解决矛盾的思想斗争，党的生命也就停止了。”事实完全证明了毛主席的这一英明论断。在我们党的历史上，无论是同“左”倾机会主义的斗争，或者是同右倾机会主义的斗争，还是当前同以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派的斗争，都是社会上两个阶级、两条道路斗争在党内的反映。
    一小撮钻进我们党内的叛徒、特务、反革命分子和顽固不化的走资派，都是国民党反动派的残渣余孽，都是最危险的“定时炸弹”。一旦时机成熟，他们就要夺取政权。他们同我们的斗争是你死我活的斗争。因此，我们对于这些反动家伙，“毫无疑义地是应该采用残酷斗争或无情打击的手段的，因为那些坏人正在利用这种手段对付党，我们如果还对他们宽容，那就会正中坏人的奸计。”也只有彻底清除这些“定时炸弹”，才能真正纯洁党的组织，加强党在毛泽东思想基础上的团结，增强党的战斗力，保证毛主席无产阶级革命路线的贯彻执行，保证我们的党和国家永不变色。
    党内另一个最大走资派如此恶毒地攻击和反对党内路线斗争，就是要破坏党的团结和统一，篡夺党的领导大权，断送党的生命。他只许资产阶级、修正主义向党进攻，不许党领导无产阶级和广大革命人民对他们进行反击。他疯狂地叫嚣什么：“既然这一批人可以打倒另一批人，那末，另一批人难道就不可以起来打倒这一批人吗？”多么恶毒！多么反动！他就是这样公开煽动那些叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派和反革命两面派起来推翻以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部。
      “在社会主义国家共产党内，不可避免地存在马克思列宁主义同各种机会主义、主要是修正主义的斗争。”这次无产阶级文化大革命，使我们更加深刻认识到，只要社会上还有两个阶级、两条道路的斗争，党内就不可避免地要存在无产阶级革命路线同资产阶级反动路线的斗争。革命越是接近全面胜利，阶级敌人越是要垂死挣扎，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争就越复杂，越尖锐。我们共产党员、革命战士必须把阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟提得高高的，狠抓阶级斗争，狠抓路线斗争，把无产阶级反对资产阶级的阶级斗争进行到底！
