The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary workers of the Zaozhuang Coal Administration in Shandong Province have resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production." They have seized the revolution and vigorously promoted production, completing ahead of schedule the state's coal mining and tunneling plans for the first half of the year.

Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, receiving the representatives of the national coal mining "grasp revolution, promote production" conference, is the greatest concern and encouragement for the revolutionary workers of the Zaozhuang mining area. They have raised the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, deeply carried out revolutionary criticism, and with the greatest revolutionary enthusiasm, achieved new victories in production. On the basis of winning two coal mining battles in April and May, the entire administration completed the tunneling plan for the first half of the year 22 days ahead of schedule on June 8th; on June 18th, it completed the state's coal mining plan for the first half of the year 12 days ahead of schedule.

Since the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of the Zaozhuang Coal Administration, under the guidance of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in the mine, they have always insisted on putting revolution in command of production. They have followed Chairman Mao's instructions to "never forget class struggle" and firmly grasped the direction of struggle, firmly holding onto class struggle without letting up. The day after the Revolutionary Committee was established, all members packed their bags, took Chairman Mao's revolutionary works, went down to the work areas, and set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes on the front lines of class struggle and production struggle. In the study classes, they studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the workers, criticized China's Khrushchev's theory of "class struggle extinguished," and analyzed the new situation, new trends, and new characteristics of class struggle together. They also went to the "mass grave" and the "bone tower," asking old miners to recount their bitter experiences of oppression and exploitation in the old society. This strengthened the committee members' class consciousness and class struggle awareness, making them love the great leader Chairman Mao even more and hate China's Khrushchev even more.

After the establishment of the revolutionary committee in this mining area, a small handful of class enemies stirred up a rightist wind of reversal, spreading rumors and setting fires, attempting to deny the great achievements of the Cultural Revolution, split the ranks of the revolutionary cadres, and sabotage the newly established revolutionary committee. They also incited reactionary anarchism and deliberately caused production accidents. In response to this situation, the Revolutionary Committee, together with the revolutionary cadres, united the broad masses of revolutionaries to launch a fierce attack on the class enemies. They fully mobilized the masses to expose a small handful of class enemies who had infiltrated the revolutionary ranks and engaged in a head-on struggle with them. In the struggle against the enemy, they followed Chairman Mao's instructions on "who are our enemies and who are our friends," seriously distinguishing between the two types of contradictions, and accurately and decisively striking down a small handful of class enemies, uniting all forces that can be united.

The revolutionary cadres and revolutionary workers of the Zaozhuang mining area, in conjunction with the struggle against the enemy, also carried out in-depth revolutionary criticism. They fiercely exposed and criticized the revisionist goods such as "production first" and "profit-oriented" advocated by China's Khrushchev and his agents, criticized the bourgeois management methods, and while breaking down the old, established some new management systems that emphasized proletarian politics, greatly mobilizing the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers.

"Class struggle, once grasped, works wonders." Through the struggle against the enemy and the carrying out of revolutionary criticism, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has been deeply ingrained in people's hearts. The production enthusiasm and creativity of the broad revolutionary workers have been further brought into play. Attendance rates, work hour utilization rates, and labor productivity have all significantly improved, production accidents have decreased, and labor discipline has been strengthened. Since the second quarter, production has been rising steadily. The coal production in April increased by 3.94% compared to March, May increased by 19.81% compared to April, and the average daily production in the first ten days of June increased by 35% compared to the first ten days of April.

    通过对敌斗争和革命大批判调动职工革命积极性
    枣庄矿区提前完成上半年采煤计划
    据新华社济南二十三日电　山东省枣庄矿务局广大无产阶级革命派和革命职工，坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，狠抓革命，猛促生产，提前完成了上半年国家的采煤计划和掘进计划。
    毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席接见全国煤矿抓革命，促生产会议的代表，对枣庄矿区革命职工是最大的关怀，最大的鼓舞。他们更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，深入开展革命大批判，并以最大的革命干劲，夺取生产的新胜利。在四、五两月取得两个夺煤大战的胜利基础上，全局于八日提前二十二天完成了上半年掘进计划；十八日，又提前十二天完成了上半年国家采煤计划。
    枣庄矿务局革命委员会成立以后，在驻矿人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，始终坚持以革命统帅生产。他们按照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，狠抓阶级斗争不转向。革委会成立后的第二天，全体成员就打起背包，带着毛主席的革命宝书，下到工区，在阶级斗争和生产斗争第一线，办起了毛泽东思想学习班，他们在学习班里，和工人一起学习毛主席最新指示，一起批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，一起研究分析阶级斗争的新形势、新动向、新特点。他们还到“万人坑”旁、“白骨塔”下，请老矿工讲旧社会被压迫、被剥削的苦难遭遇。这样使革委会成员加强了阶级和阶级斗争的观念，对伟大领袖毛主席更加热爱，对中国赫鲁晓夫更加仇恨。
    这个矿区的革命委员会成立后，一小撮阶级敌人刮起了一股右倾翻案妖风，他们煽阴风，点鬼火，妄图否定无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成就，分裂无产阶级革命派队伍，破坏新生的革命委员会。他们还大肆煽动反动的无政府主义，有意制造生产事故。针对这种情况，革委会同无产阶级革命派一起，团结广大革命群众对阶级敌人展开了猛烈进攻。他们充分发动群众揪出了一小撮混进革命队伍的阶级敌人，同他们展开了针锋相对的斗争。在对敌斗争中，他们按照毛主席“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题，也是文化大革命的首要问题”的教导，认真区别两类不同性质的矛盾，稳、准、狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人，团结了一切可以团结的力量。
    枣庄矿区的无产阶级革命派和革命职工结合对敌斗争，还深入开展了革命大批判。他们狠狠地揭发和批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人鼓吹的“生产第一”、“利润挂帅”等修正主义黑货，批判了资产阶级的企业管理方式，并且边破边立，逐步建立了一些突出无产阶级政治的新的管理制度，极大地调动了广大职工的生产积极性。
      “阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”通过对敌斗争和开展革命大批判，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线更加深入人心，广大革命职工的生产积极性和创造性，得到进一步发挥。出勤率、工时利用率和劳动生产率都显著提高，生产事故减少，劳动纪律加强。第二季度以来，生产节节上升。四月份的煤炭产量，比三月份提高百分之三点九四，五月份又比四月份提高百分之十九点八一，六月上旬的平均日产量比四月上旬提高了百分之三十五。
