Two thousand students from various universities in Tokyo and its suburbs recently held a rally and demonstration, demanding the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and supporting the just struggle of French workers and students.

At a rally held in Hibiya Park, student representatives strongly condemned U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam and the Sato reactionary government for acting as a henchman of U.S. imperialism in pushing its aggressive policies in Asia. They also strongly protested against the attempts by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries to use Japanese youth and students as cannon fodder in their aggressive wars.

The students at the rally also exposed the revisionist line of the Japanese Communist Party's Miyamoto group, which advocates relying on U.S. imperialism's "wisdom," using the "parliamentary road" to withdraw U.S. troops from Japan and remove American military bases. They also expressed their resolute support for the just struggle of French students. After the rally, the students, carrying red flags and shouting anti-U.S. slogans, marched to the U.S. Embassy to demonstrate. The students bravely fought with the thousands of armed police guarding the U.S. Embassy.

An "F-4C Phantom" fighter-bomber from the U.S. Air Force's Tsuiki Base, which was conducting combat training for the war in Vietnam, crashed on the evening of the 2nd into the building of the Electronics Computing Center under construction at the Faculty of Engineering of Kyushu University in Fukuoka City, completely destroying it. The arrogant behavior of U.S. aircraft in Japan has sparked strong protests from Kyushu University students and the Japanese people.

According to reports, that night, about a thousand Kyushu University students and residents from Kyushu rushed to the scene and held a rally and demonstration to protest against the crimes of the U.S. military. The students angrily shouted slogans such as "Yankees, go home!" "Demand the closure of the Tsuiki Base!" "Oppose U.S. aggression against Vietnam!" They also marched to the U.S. Consulate in Fukuoka to demonstrate.

The Sato reactionary government, which has always served its U.S. master, sent a large number of fully armed police to suppress the students' protest actions. When the angry students surrounded the vehicles of the U.S. military police sent from the Tsuiki Base to the scene and fought against them, the armed police brutally beat the patriotic students. The patriotic students resolutely resisted the police's savage suppression.

According to reports, recently, while the U.S. imperialists have been intensifying their "peace talks" deception, the activities of some U.S. military bases in Japan for the war in Vietnam have become more frequent. About a hundred U.S. bandit aircraft take off or land at the Tsuiki Base every day. The "Phantom" aircraft stationed at this base are ready to "emerge" at any time. At the same time, the activities of U.S. military transport aircraft between the Tsuiki Base and other U.S. military bases in Yokota, Tachikawa, Okinawa, and Guam have also become more frequent.

    日本东京两千学生举行集会游行
    九州大学学生和九州群众集会示威愤怒抗议美机横行霸道
    新华社讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本东京和郊区各大学的两千名学生最近举行集会和示威游行，要求废除日美“安全条约”，支持法国工人和学生的正义斗争。
    在日比谷公园举行的集会上，学生代表强烈谴责美帝侵略越南和佐藤反动政府充当美帝帮凶在亚洲推行侵略政策，并强烈抗议美日反动派企图利用日本青年和学生充当侵略战争的炮灰的阴谋。
    学生们在集会上还揭露了日共宫本修正主义集团所鼓吹的依靠美帝“明智”，通过“议会道路”，就能从日本撤走美军和撤除美国军事基地的反革命谬论。他们还表示坚决支持法国学生的正义斗争。集会后，学生们高举红旗，高呼反美口号，前往美国使馆示威游行。学生们同守卫在美国使馆前的数千名武装警察进行英勇搏斗。
    新华社东京三日电美国空军板付基地的一架为侵越战争进行战斗训练的“F—4C鬼怪式”战斗轰炸机，二日晚坠落在福冈市的九州大学工学部，完全焚毁了这个大学兴建中的大型电子计算机中心大楼。美国飞机在日本的这种横行霸道的行径，引起了九州大学学生和广大日本人民的强烈抗议。
    据报道，这天晚上大约一千名九州大学的学生和九州群众赶到现场，愤怒地举行了抗议美军罪行的集会和示威游行。学生们愤怒地高呼：“美国佬，滚回去！”“要求撤除板付基地！”“反对美国侵略越南！”等口号。学生们还冲到美国在福冈市的领事馆门前举行示威。
    一贯为其美国主子效劳的日本佐藤反动政府丧心病狂地出动大批全副武装的警察，镇压学生的抗议行动。当愤怒的学生把从板付基地开到现场去的美国宪兵队的车辆包围起来并对他们进行斗争的时候，武装警察野蛮地殴打爱国学生。爱国学生对日本警察的残暴镇压进行了坚决的抵抗。
    据报道，最近，在美帝加紧玩弄“和谈”骗局的同时，美国在日本的一些军事基地为侵越战争进行的各种活动更加频繁起来。在板付基地每天大约有一百架美国强盗飞机起飞或降落，常驻在这个基地的“鬼怪式”飞机做好了随时可以紧急“出动”的准备。同时，美国军事运输机在板付基地和横田、厚木、冲绳及关岛的美国军事基地之间的活动也更加频繁。
