Belgium's new government, after a four-month struggle, was finally formed on the 17th. The new government is a coalition of the Christian Social Party and the Socialist Party, with Christian Social Party member Gaston Eyskens serving as Prime Minister. The previous government collapsed on February 7th. Due to the stagnation of industrial production, severe unemployment, rising prices, public dissatisfaction, and internal contradictions within the ruling class, the formation of the new cabinet was delayed. This government will also be unable to solve the political and economic crises facing Belgium.

    比利时新政府拼凑了四个多月
    比利时新政府经过四个多月的难产后，于十七日拼凑完成。新政府是由天主教社会党同社会党联合组成的，由天主教社会党人伊斯更斯担任首相。前政府是在二月七日倒台的。由于比利时工业生产停滞、失业严重、物价上涨、人民不满和统治集团内部矛盾，造成了新内阁的难产。现在这个政府也同样不可能解决比利时面临的政治和经济危机问题。
