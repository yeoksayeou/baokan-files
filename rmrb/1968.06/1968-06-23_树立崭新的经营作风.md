One day, the revolutionary staff of the West Tao Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Wuzhi County, Henan Province, took "three summer" agricultural tools to the countryside. A poor peasant member requested the cooperative to repair the "three summer" agricultural tools. A staff member replied, "We are in charge of selling things, not repairing." With one sentence, the request of this peasant member was rejected.

This incident drew the attention of the cooperative's revolutionary committee. They believed that the cooperative is dedicated to serving socialist industry and agriculture. If they followed the "profit-oriented" black "business principles" and focused solely on selling things to make money, they would deviate towards capitalism.

In response to this situation, the revolutionary committee organized all the revolutionary staff to use the opportunity of delivering books and agricultural tools to poor and lower-middle-class peasants to jointly criticize China's Khrushchev's black "business principles." Through joint revolutionary criticism with poor and lower-middle-class peasants, the cooperative staff further realized that China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods on the commercial front are the "protective charms" for landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, and speculators to sabotage the socialist economy. They collude from top to bottom, work together, and commit evil deeds, aiming to restore capitalism.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism, is revolution. Destruction must be reasoned, and reasoning is construction. Destruction comes first, and construction is within it." Based on the issues exposed by revolutionary staff and poor and lower-middle-class peasants, the revolutionary committee led everyone to further study Chairman Mao's teachings, inspiring everyone to analyze and criticize China's Khrushchev's black "business principles" from the perspective of class struggle and line struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, significantly raising the class struggle and line struggle awareness of the broad revolutionary staff. They said: In the past, we did not view issues from the perspective of two-line struggle, always thinking that the cooperative and poor and lower-middle-class peasants had a buyer-seller relationship, with buyers and sellers having two different minds. Now we see clearly that this is China's Khrushchev's attempt to restore capitalism by deliberately sabotaging the worker-peasant alliance.

While carrying out revolutionary criticism, the revolutionary committee organized revolutionary staff to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings on wholeheartedly serving the people. Based on improved understanding, the broad revolutionary staff voluntarily engaged in learning repair techniques. More than 70% of the staff quickly learned repair techniques. They carried books, repair tools, and "three summer" materials, touring various teams, studying Chairman Mao's works with poor and lower-middle-class peasants, criticizing China's Khrushchev together, supplying "three summer" materials, and repairing "three summer" agricultural tools.

The broad revolutionary staff of the cooperative served the poor and lower-middle-class peasants more actively. They understood what each production team needed and proactively delivered goods to the doorstep. They also set up "Red Sun Exhibition Hall" and "Bookstand" for poor and lower-middle-class peasants. Poor and lower-middle-class peasants reflected: "For thousands of years, buying and selling have been two different people, two different minds. Now the cooperative and we poor and lower-middle-class peasants have become one family, one mind."

    树立崭新的经营作风
    有一天，河南省武陟县西陶供销合作社革命职工们拉着“三夏”农具下乡，一位贫农社员向供销社提出维修“三夏”农具的要求，一个职工回答：“我们是管卖东西的，不管修理。”一句话拒绝了这位社员的要求。
    这件事引起了供销社革委会的重视。他们认为，供销社是全心全意为社会主义工农业服务的，如果按照“利润挂帅”的黑“生意经”办事，单纯为了卖东西赚钱，就会走到资本主义的邪路上去。
    针对这一情况，革委会组织全社革命职工趁着向贫下中农送宝书、送农具的机会，和贫下中农一起狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的黑“生意经”。通过和贫下中农共同开展革命的大批判，供销社职工进一步认识到：中国赫鲁晓夫在商业战线上散布的反革命修正主义黑货，是地、富、反、坏、右和投机倒把分子破坏社会主义经济的“护身符”。他们上呼下应，互相配合，为非作歹，其罪恶目的就是妄图复辟资本主义。
    毛主席教导我们说：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。”革委会根据革命职工和贫下中农揭发出来的问题，引导大家进一步学习毛主席的教导，启发大家从两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的高度，对中国赫鲁晓夫的黑“生意经”进行分析批判，大大提高了广大革命职工的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟。他们说：过去，我们没有用两条路线斗争的观点看问题，总认为供销社和贫下中农是买卖关系，买者卖者是两条心。现在看清了，这是中国赫鲁晓夫为了复辟资本主义，在故意破坏工农联盟。
    在开展革命大批判的同时，革委会组织革命职工反复学习了毛主席完全彻底为人民服务的教导。广大革命职工在提高认识的基础上，自觉地开展了学习维修技术的活动。百分之七十以上的职工很快地学会了维修技术。他们带上宝书，带上修配工具和“三夏”物资，巡回各队，和贫下中农一起学习毛主席著作，一起批判中国赫鲁晓夫；一边供应“三夏”物资，一边维修“三夏”农具。
    供销社广大革命职工更加积极地为广大贫下中农服务。他们了解到哪个生产队需要什么东西，就主动送货上门。他们还为贫下中农设立了“红太阳展览馆”、“宝书台”。贫下中农反映说：“几千年来买卖是两家人，两条心，现在供销社和咱们贫下中农成了一家人，一条心了。”
