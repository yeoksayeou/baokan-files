Paris students took to the streets again on June 10 to protest the brutal killing of a student by the police. They built barricades and fought with the police throughout the night. Meanwhile, workers in some French industrial sectors resolutely resisted the French authorities and the French revisionists' sabotage and continued their struggle.

In the afternoon of June 10, Paris students held a rally near the Renault car factory in Flins to support the striking workers there, but were brutally suppressed by the police. The savage police pushed some students into the Seine River, drowning one student. Upon learning of this new crime committed by the French ruling class against the students, Paris students took to the streets in protest, gathering in their thousands.

The students waved red flags, sang the "Internationale," and chanted slogans denouncing the French ruling class's brutal suppression of students as they prepared to march to the center of Paris. However, when they reached the Saint-Michel Bridge, they were intercepted by a large contingent of police sent by the authorities. The police wielded batons and attacked the students, throwing tear gas and stun grenades. The students were forced to build nine barricades and bravely fought back with homemade Molotov cocktails and stones. One police car was set on fire.

The students fought with the police until dawn. In the Paris University area, explosions and the thick smoke of tear gas filled the air all night. In the morning, the students retreated to the university, but the police took the opportunity to surround the university and throw tear gas at the students occupying the school. The students fought back with Molotov cocktails, forcing the police to retreat.

During the June 10 barricade battle, 22 students were illegally arrested, and many were injured.

On June 10, workers in many French industrial sectors continued to strike despite threats and suppression from the French authorities and betrayal by the French revisionists, especially in the major industrial centers of Paris and Lyon. The striking workers refused to follow the yellow union's call to return to work and continued their struggle.

In the automotive industry, workers at Renault, Citroën, and Peugeot factories continued to occupy their factories, thwarting the capitalists' and yellow unions' schemes to force workers back to work.

French sailors, dock workers, radio and television station employees, university teachers, and most high school teachers remained on strike. Paris's large department stores remained closed. In the Mediterranean coastal town of La Seyne, striking workers reoccupied the naval and civilian shipyards.

While desperately trying to sabotage the French workers' and students' brave struggle against the rotten capitalist system, the French revisionist group began their "election campaign" on June 10 to once again squeeze into the bourgeois parliament. This once again exposed the ugly faces of these traitors and labor sellouts. The leader of the French revisionist group, Roger, gave a "campaign speech" in Paris on June 10, where he viciously cursed the workers' and students' brave struggle as "blind violence and hysteria," warning against "left-wing adventurists" in the ranks, and at the same time, he tried to assure the French ruling class that the French revisionist group's "attitude is to avoid violent conflict," begging for "full understanding" to organize a "democratic alliance government" where "communists (referring to the French revisionists) should have their place."

The French revisionist group's open betrayal of the interests of the French working class can only accelerate the awakening of the French workers, helping them break through all obstacles and push their struggle to victory.

The French workers and progressive students, with the glorious revolutionary tradition of the Paris Commune, continue to fight side by side unyieldingly. The image shows the Paris workers and progressive students bravely fighting against a large contingent of military police on June 10.

    法国学生上街示威同警察英勇搏斗
    法国工人坚决抵制统治当局和法修的破坏继续坚持斗争
    法修集团大搞“竞选活动”削尖脑袋拚命往资产阶级议会里挤真是无耻透顶
    新华社十一日讯　巴黎消息：巴黎学生十日再次举行强大示威，抗议警察野蛮杀害一名参加斗争的学生。学生们筑起街垒，同前去镇压的警察进行了通宵达旦的搏斗。同时，法国一些工业部门的工人坚决抵制法国当局和法修的破坏，仍在继续坚持斗争。
    十日下午，巴黎学生在弗兰的雷诺汽车工厂附近举行集会，声援该厂罢工工人的斗争，遭到警察的野蛮镇压。残暴的警察竟把一些学生推入塞纳河中，一个学生惨遭淹死。巴黎大学生得知法国统治集团对学生犯下的这一新罪行后，纷纷上街抗议，在街上集合的学生后来达到几千人。
    学生们举着红旗，唱着《国际歌》，一路高呼谴责法国统治集团野蛮镇压学生的战斗口号，准备游行到巴黎市中心去。但是，当他们到达圣米歇尔大桥时，遭到当局派来的大批警察无理拦截。警察挥舞棍棒袭击学生，并且向学生投掷催泪弹和震荡手榴弹。学生被迫筑起九个街垒，用自制燃烧瓶和石块等向警察英勇反击。一辆警车被击中起火。
    学生同警察一直搏斗到天亮。在巴黎大学区，爆炸声通宵不绝，催泪瓦斯的浓烟到处弥漫。天亮后学生退回巴黎大学，但是警察却乘机包围大学，向占领学校的学生投催泪弹，学生再次用燃烧瓶等还击，迫使警察退去。
    在十日街垒战中，有二十二名学生被非法逮捕，许多学生受伤。
    法国许多工业部门的工人十日继续不顾法国当局的威胁和镇压以及法修的出卖，坚持罢工，特别是在法国主要工业中心巴黎地区和里昂地区，罢工工人拒绝执行黄色工会的复工号令，继续斗争。
    在汽车工业部门，雷诺、雪铁龙、普吉奥等汽车公司所属工厂的工人，十日粉碎了资本家和黄色工会欺压工人复工的种种阴谋，继续占领工厂。
    法国的海员、码头工人、电台和电视台的职工、大学教师和绝大部分中学教师仍在罢工，巴黎的大百货公司仍然停业。在地中海岸的拉塞恩，罢工工人重新占领了海军和民用造船厂。
    在千方百计地破坏法国工人和学生为反对腐朽的资本主义制度而展开的英勇斗争的同时，法国修正主义集团十日迫不及待地开始了为再次挤入资产阶级议会而进行的“竞选活动”，这再一次赤裸裸地暴露了这伙叛徒和工贼的丑恶嘴脸。法修集团的总头目罗歇十日在巴黎发表“竞选演说”，一方面再次恶毒咒骂工人学生的英勇斗争是
  “盲目的暴力行动和歇斯底里”，胡说什么要“提防”队伍中的“左翼冒险分子”，同时竭力向法国统治集团表白法修集团的“态度是避免暴力冲突”，摇尾乞求“取得充分谅解”，以便组织“共产党人（指法修）在其中该有它地位的一个民主联盟政府”。
    法国修正主义集团对法国工人阶级利益的这种公然叛卖，只能加速法国工人的觉醒，使他们冲破重重阻挠，把斗争不断推向胜利。（附图片）
