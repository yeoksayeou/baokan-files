In the wake of the massive worker and student struggles in France, the progressive student movement in Britain is also rapidly developing. Many university students have taken concrete actions such as boycotting classes, staging sit-ins, marching in the streets, and occupying schools to oppose the government's aggressive policies, the decayed education system, and to demand democracy and freedom. They have also expressed their support for the just struggles of French students and workers.

On the 3rd, hundreds of students from twenty colleges at Oxford University held a demonstration, demanding that the school administration abolish the reactionary regulation that prohibits the distribution of political leaflets.

Since last October, students at Oxford University have been engaged in a struggle against the school's reactionary regulations. Recently, they defied the school's ban and distributed political propaganda to workers at the Leyland Motor Manufacturing Plant. On the 3rd, students held banners and sat in a large hall for three hours. They also stormed into the school's administrative office, surrounding the deans who monitor students. They also engaged in a fierce struggle with the police guarding the school.

The students' victorious struggle forced the deans to agree to abolish the ban on distributing political leaflets.

Meanwhile, students at Hornsey College of Art in north London continue to fight against the school's decayed management system. By the 3rd, they had occupied the school for a week.

In mid-May, 1,200 students at Essex University went on strike for a week to protest the school's unjust decision to expel three students who participated in a demonstration against a "biological warfare expert" giving a lecture on campus. The students' strike forced the school to reinstate the three students.

Recently, students and youth from other places also demonstrated in front of the chemical and biological warfare research institution in Bordon, Wiltshire, protesting that these war research institutions use universities to serve aggressive policies.
