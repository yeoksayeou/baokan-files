The Jingpu Railway bridge over the New Shenhe River in the Huai River North Plain of Anhui has been completed recently. A grand opening ceremony was held on the bridge construction site on the morning of the 8th.

The New Shenhe River project is a key project to further control floods and waterlogging in the Huai River North Plain in response to the great call of Chairman Mao Zedong to "definitely fix the Huai River." The New Shenhe River channel is 130 kilometers long, starting from the north of Su County City, diverting the Tuo River, passing through Lingbi and Si County, and entering Hongze Lake. The middle section crosses the Jingpu Railway. The completion of the Jingpu Railway bridge over the New Shenhe River ensures that the New Shenhe River project can better function during this year's flood season and guarantees the smooth operation of the Jingpu Railway.

Under the leadership of the Jinan Railway Bureau Revolutionary Committee, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, the workers and cadres participating in the bridge construction held extensive classes to study Mao Zedong Thought, carried out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, armed the minds of the broad masses of workers with great Mao Zedong Thought, and carried out self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. This greatly promoted the ideological revolution of the people. With boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, the broad revolutionary cadres and workers, with the heroic spirit of "daring to change the heavens and the earth," are determined to complete the bridge before the flood season. Since the official start of construction on March 15, it took only 85 days to complete this 260.18-meter-long, 13-span double-track railway bridge, with the engineering quality fully meeting the standards.

    根治淮北平原洪涝灾害的一项关键工程
    津浦铁路新汴河大桥建成
    新华社合肥十五日电　安徽淮北平原新汴河工地横跨新汴河上的津浦铁路大桥，已在最近建成。八日上午，铁路大桥工地上举行了隆重的通车典礼。
    新汴河工程是遵照伟大领袖毛主席“一定要把淮河修好”的伟大号召，进一步根治淮北平原洪涝灾害的一项关键工程。新汴河河道，共长一百三十多公里，从宿县城北截引沱河起，经灵壁、泗县入洪泽湖，中间穿过津浦铁路。横跨新汴河上的津浦铁路大桥的建成，可以保证新汴河工程在今年汛期更好地发挥效益，并且保证津浦铁路畅通无阻。
    领导这一建设任务的济南铁路局革命委员会，在人民解放军帮助下，组织参加大桥施工的工人、干部大办毛泽东思想学习班，深入持久地开展革命大批判，用伟大的毛泽东思想武装广大职工的头脑，开展斗私批修，大大促进了人的思想革命化。广大革命职工怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚，以“敢教日月换新天”的英雄气概，决心在汛期前建好大桥。从三月十五日正式开工以来，只用短短八十五天时间，就建成了这座长达二百六十点一八米的十三孔双轨铁路大桥，工程质量完全符合标准。
