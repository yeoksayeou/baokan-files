More than 200,000 revolutionary teachers, students, and cadres from the capital's colleges and universities, as well as government agencies, have successively headed to the agricultural front lines in the suburbs of Beijing to support the summer harvest, planting, and management efforts.

In recent days, along the roads leading to the suburbs of Beijing, groups of revolutionary teachers, students, and cadres have been marching, carrying red flags and portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao, singing revolutionary songs with high spirits as they head towards the communes. Those who arrived early in the suburbs are already working side by side with the commune members in the wheat fields, striving for a complete victory in the "three summer" campaign.

This year, the various schools and agencies in the capital have firmly implemented Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in supporting the "three summer" work, using the "May 7th Directive" as a guide, and emphasizing proletarian politics. Before heading to the countryside, each unit conducted political mobilization and ideological education. Many units held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, organizing participants to seriously study Chairman Mao's brilliant "May 7th Directive" and related teachings, arming themselves with Mao Zedong Thought to guide their actions. Everyone expressed their determination to turn the "three summer" labor site into a large classroom for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and a great furnace for tempering their limitless loyalty to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Teams of Red Guards stood before the great leader Chairman Mao's portrait, pledging to take Comrade Deng Yiping as a shining example, humbly learning from the poor and lower-middle peasants, and striving to excel in politics, work style, learning from the poor and lower-middle peasants, completing tasks, and propagating Mao Zedong Thought during the support for the "three summer" labor. Some students even spent the night carefully carving many sunflower-facing "loyalty" red hearts, and brought with them colorful portraits of Chairman Mao and Mao badges, preparing to give them to the poor and lower-middle peasants, letting every household raise the eternal red sun. Some made Mao Zedong quotation boards by hand, carrying them with them, ensuring that they act according to Chairman Mao's instructions at all times during the "three summer" labor.

The revolutionary teachers, students, cadres participating in the "three summer" labor, and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants work, study, and live together, determined to win this battle of the "three summer." The revolutionary youngsters regard the poor and lower-middle peasants as their teachers, inviting old peasants to share village history, family history, recall bitterness, and reflect on sweetness, conducting class education, further raising the revolutionary teachers' and students' awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. They also link the actual class struggle in the countryside, jointly carrying out a thorough criticism and repudiation of the revolution, using the fields and farmlands to organize small-scale criticism meetings. Some even set up large criticism columns at the village entrances and courtyards, fiercely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies spread by China's Khrushchev and the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee's Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique in the countryside, such as the theory of "class struggle extinction," "three selfs and one package," and "suffering small losses to gain big advantages." The revolutionary teachers, students, and cadres participating in the "three summer" labor all regard propagating Mao Zedong Thought to the poor and lower-middle peasants as a major political task. Many schools and agencies supporting the "three summer" organized Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, using labor breaks to read "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to the poor and lower-middle peasants, perform programs, praise our great leader Chairman Mao, and propagate the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, which was warmly welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Revolutionary teachers and students supporting the "three summer" work in Beijing learn from the People's Liberation Army's hardworking and self-reliant style, carrying their bags, and heading to the summer harvest front lines with high spirits.

    首都二十万革命师生和干部踊跃奔赴京郊投入三夏劳动
    新华社十五日讯　首都二十多万大、中学校的革命师生和机关干部，相继奔赴京郊农业生产第一线，支援农村夏收、夏种、夏管。
    连日来，在通往北京郊区的大道上，一支支革命师生和机关干部队伍，举着红旗，捧着伟大领袖毛主席的画像，唱着嘹亮的革命歌曲，精神抖擞地向各公社进发；下乡早的革命师生和机关干部正在麦浪翻滚的田野里，和社员们肩并肩地劳动着，奋夺“三夏”战斗的全面胜利。
    今年，首都各学校、机关在支援“三夏”工作中，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，以“五·七”指示为指针，大力突出无产阶级政治。下乡前，各单位普遍进行了政治动员和思想教育。不少单位举办了毛泽东思想学习班，组织下乡人员认真学习毛主席光辉的“五·七”指示和有关教导，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，指导行动。大家纷纷表示，要把“三夏”劳动现场当作活学活用毛泽东思想的大课堂，当作进一步锤炼无限忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的赤胆忠心的大熔炉。一队队红卫兵小将站在伟大领袖毛主席像前，表示决心以门合同志为光辉榜样，虚心向贫下中农学习，在支援“三夏”劳动中，努力做到政治思想好，三八作风好，向贫下中农学习好，完成任务好，宣传毛泽东思想好。有的学生还连夜精心刻制了许多葵花向阳的“忠”字红心，并带上了毛主席的彩色画像和毛主席像章，准备送到贫下中农的手里，让家家升起永远不落的红太阳。有的亲手制作了毛主席语录牌，带在身边，使自己在“三夏”劳动中，时时处处按照毛主席的指示办事。
    参加“三夏”劳动的革命师生、机关干部和广大贫下中农同劳动、同学习、同生活，决心打好“三夏”这一仗。革命小将们拜贫下中农为师，请老贫农讲村史、家史，忆苦思甜，上阶级教育课，进一步提高了革命师生的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。他们还联系农村阶级斗争的实际，共同深入开展革命大批判，利用田间、地头组织小型批判会，有的还在村口、场院设立了大批判专栏，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫以及旧北京市委彭真反革命修正主义集团在农村散布的“阶级斗争熄灭”论、“三自一包”、“吃小亏占大便宜”等反革命修正主义谬论。参加“三夏”劳动的革命师生和机关干部都把向贫下中农宣传毛泽东思想作为重大的政治任务。不少学校、机关支援“三夏”的人员组织了毛泽东思想宣传队，利用劳动空隙时间，给贫下中农读《毛主席语录》，表演节目，歌颂我们的伟大领袖毛主席，宣传战无不胜的毛泽东思想，受到贫下中农的热烈欢迎。（附图片）
