Revolutionary committees in Lanzhou Railway Bureau have intensified class struggle, mobilizing broad revolutionary workers. Lanzhou Railway Bureau achieves dual victories in revolution and production. All units needing to establish a three-in-one temporary power structure have set up revolutionary committees. Transportation tasks are completed ahead of schedule every month, and various production indicators are steadily rising.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, June 9th—The Revolutionary Committee of Lanzhou Railway Bureau firmly remembers Chairman Mao's teaching, "Never forget class struggle," and with the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist personnel, has launched a deep revolutionary criticism, actively attacking class enemies, and promoting production development.

Currently, more than 170 units within Lanzhou Railway Bureau that need to establish a three-in-one temporary power structure have all set up revolutionary committees. In production, since the establishment of the bureau's revolutionary committee in March, trains on all lines have been running smoothly without obstruction, and cargo loading and unloading have been continuous day and night. Many stations and sections have completed the national transportation plan ahead of schedule every month. The main indicators of the entire bureau, such as cargo shipment tons, have all exceeded the national plan. The main indicator reflecting railway transportation efficiency—the average daily car loading quantity—has been rising steadily. In April, it increased by 30% compared to the first quarter, and in May, it increased by 25.8% compared to April. The loading quantities of key materials such as coal, petroleum, and mining construction materials have all exceeded the national plan.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the broad revolutionary people led by it and the KMT reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Chairman Mao's wise teachings have further armed the minds of the revolutionary committee members and broad revolutionary workers. They deeply understand that although the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories, the closer it gets to overall victory, the more complex and profound the class struggle becomes. The enemies of the proletariat will not resign themselves to defeat; they will make desperate struggles. The revolutionary committee leads broad revolutionary workers to seriously study the new situation and trends of class struggle, actively launching fierce attacks on class enemies, and rooting out a handful of traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries hiding within the railway bureau. They have thoroughly exposed and criticized them, smashing the class enemies' various plots to sabotage the revolution and production, and mobilizing the production enthusiasm of broad revolutionary workers. After the revolutionary committee of Wuwei Station Area was established, a handful of class enemies secretly spread rumors, stirred up trouble, maliciously attacked the new revolutionary committee, slandered, incited, created divisions, and sabotaged production. When the revolutionary committee led broad revolutionary workers to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, they identified the eyes and exposed the bad elements who sabotaged the revolutionary committee and production. Since then, the transportation tasks of this station area have been completed ahead of schedule every month, and various production indicators have been steadily rising.

Broad revolutionary workers of Lanzhou Railway Bureau, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have launched a deep and sustained revolutionary criticism. They have organized various forms of criticism meetings in workshops, teams, work areas, and construction sites. This has brought the revolutionary criticism from the offices to the small and large units and construction sites along the railway. On the 2,000-kilometer railway line under the jurisdiction of the entire bureau, revolutionary criticism battlefields have been set up everywhere. Broad revolutionary workers have exposed and criticized the black goods of "material incentives" and "bonus leadership" promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the railway system. Revolutionary workers pointed out that these black goods are poisoned candy coated with sugar, aimed at corrupting the revolutionary will of workers, dissolving worker unity, dividing the ranks of the working class, and making workers undergo a "peaceful evolution." They excitedly said: Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman, and doing revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. We railway workers do not need "material incentives" or "bonus leadership" to do revolution; we need to emphasize proletarian politics and let Mao Zedong Thought take the lead.

Revolutionary criticism has powerfully promoted production development. The gate valve group in the foundry workshop of Lanzhou Parts Factory was previously influenced by the revisionist line of managing enterprises by the Chinese Khrushchev, focusing only on tasks and indicators, neglecting politics. Although the work was busy, the tasks were still not completed, and the scrap rate reached 14%. Through revolutionary criticism, the entire group of workers underwent significant changes in their spiritual outlook. They insisted on emphasizing proletarian politics and using Mao Zedong Thought to guide production. Not only did they complete the tasks well, but the scrap rate was also reduced to 4.2%.

Currently, broad revolutionary workers throughout the bureau, based on the completion of various main production indicators ahead of the national plan, are filled with proletarian feelings of unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao. They are full of enthusiasm, striving to be at the forefront, vowing to be pioneers in both revolution and production, and advancing with the momentum, developing the great situation, and launching a new high tide in transportation and production.

    革委会狠抓阶级斗争调动了广大革命职工的积极性
    兰州铁路局夺得革命生产双胜利
    需要成立三结合临时权力机构的单位都建立了革委会。运输任务月月超额完成，各项生产指标稳步上升
    新华社兰州九日电　兰州铁路局革命委员会牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，在人民解放军支左人员的帮助下，深入开展革命大批判，主动地向阶级敌人发起进攻，推动了生产的发展。
    目前，兰州铁路局需要成立三结合临时权力机构的一百七十多个单位，都已建立了革命委员会。在生产上，自三月份局革委会成立以来，各线列车一直畅通无阻，货物装卸昼夜不停。许多站、段月月超额完成国家运输计划，全局货物发送吨数等主要指标都超额完成了国家计划。反映铁路运输效率的主要指标——日平均装车量直线上升，今年四月份比第一季度提高百分之三十，五月份比四月份提高百分之二十五点八，其中煤、石油、矿山建设材料等重点物资的装车数都超额完成了国家计划。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”毛主席的英明教导，进一步武装了革命委员会成员和广大革命职工的头脑。他们深刻认识到，无产阶级文化大革命虽然已取得了决定性胜利，但越是接近全面胜利，阶级斗争越是复杂、深刻。无产阶级的敌人决不会甘心于失败，他们还要作垂死的挣扎。革命委员会领导广大革命职工认真研究了当前阶级斗争的新形势、新动向，主动地向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，挖出了隐藏在铁路局内部的一小撮叛徒、特务、反革命分子，对他们进行了彻底的揭发和批判，粉碎了阶级敌人妄图破坏革命和生产的种种阴谋诡计，调动了广大革命职工的生产积极性。武威站区革命委员会成立后，一小撮阶级敌人在暗地里煽阴风，点鬼火，恶毒地攻击新生的革命委员会。他们造谣生事，挑拨离间，制造分裂，破坏生产。当革命委员会领导广大革命职工学习了毛主席的最新指示，擦亮眼睛，揪出了破坏革命委员会和破坏生产的坏家伙以后，这个站区的运输任务月月超额完成，各项生产指标稳步上升。
    兰州铁路局广大革命职工以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，深入持久地开展革命大批判。他们大搞车间、班组、工区、工地等生产现场的各种形式的批判会。这样使革命大批判由机关深入到铁路沿线的大小单位和工地。在全局管辖的两千公里铁路线上，到处摆下了革命大批判的战场。广大革命职工揭露和批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在铁路系统的代理人所推行的“物质刺激”、“奖金挂帅”等反革命修正主义黑货。革命职工们指出，这些黑货都是中国赫鲁晓夫妄图腐蚀工人革命意志，瓦解工人团结，分裂工人阶级队伍，使工人“和平演变”的裹着糖衣的砒霜。他们激动地说：大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。我们铁路工人干革命不要什么“物质刺激”、“奖金挂帅”，要的是突出无产阶级政治，毛泽东思想挂帅。
    革命大批判有力地推动了生产的发展。兰州配件厂翻砂车间的闸瓦组，由于过去受中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义办企业路线的影响，只注意抓任务，抓指标，不问政治，虽然工作很忙，任务还是完不成，废品率达到百分之十四。通过革命大批判，全组职工精神面貌发生了很大变化，他们坚持突出无产阶级政治，用毛泽东思想统帅生产，不仅很好地完成了任务，而且废品率降低到百分之四点二。
    目前，全局广大革命职工，在各项主要生产指标超额完成国家计划的基础上，满怀对毛主席无限忠诚的无产阶级感情，鼓足干劲，力争上游，誓作抓革命的闯将，促生产的模范，乘胜前进，发展大好形势，掀起运输生产的新高潮。
