The revolutionary committee of Ji County, Shanxi Province, has changed its leadership style, breaking the old habit of staying in the office, and has taken root among the masses. It has established a relationship of mutual dependence with the masses and has gained the great trust of the broad revolutionary masses.

A Xinhua News Agency reporter in Taiyuan on the 22nd reported: The revolutionary committee of Ji County, Shanxi Province, has carried forward the Party's tradition of hard struggle and close ties with the masses, making the revolutionary committee deeply rooted among the masses. It has gained the great trust of the broad revolutionary masses and established a relationship of mutual dependence with them.

After the revolutionary committee was established in April last year, its members and staff, through a thorough criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, such as Khrushchev, in the office work, deeply realized that hard struggle, close ties with the masses, and the leadership method of coming from the masses and going to the masses are the glorious traditions of the Party and the consistent teachings of Chairman Mao. The newly born revolutionary committee must carry forward and develop these good traditions. The county revolutionary committee also organized everyone to study and apply "The Three Constantly Read Articles" and to eat bitter meals, recall family history, and revolutionary struggle history to strengthen their mass perspective and further realize the thought revolutionization of the leading cadre.

Most of the members of the revolutionary committee are from poor peasant backgrounds, and the main leading cadres are old cadres who grew up during the War of Resistance Against Japan and have deep class feelings with the masses. After their class consciousness was raised, they unanimously proposed to carry forward the old Eighth Route Army style, go to the masses, share weal and woe with the masses, and be good servants of the people. Of the fifteen standing committee members, those who are workers continue to work, those who are peasants continue to farm, and those who are students continue to study. The revolutionary leading cadres among the standing committee members, except for a few who stay in the office to handle daily affairs, all go deep into the grassroots and among the masses to solve problems on the spot. They carry their luggage on their backs, bring the works of Chairman Mao, and walk from one village to another, eating, living, studying, fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, and laboring with the poor and lower-middle peasants. They also take on the hardest and dirtiest jobs, maintaining the character of an ordinary laborer.

In the process of going deep into the grassroots and among the masses, the members of the county revolutionary committee have seriously emphasized proletarian politics. They, together with the grassroots cadres, have focused on the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, on class struggle and the thought revolutionization of people, and on promoting the spirit of self-reliance and striving for progress as exemplified by Dazhai. In the past, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the old county committee advocated "material incentives" and "money as the commander." When they went down to "stay and work," they only focused on grain, cotton, and oil, without distinguishing between enemies and friends. They brought money, fertilizers, and equipment wherever they went. Now, the members of the revolutionary committee bring Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's latest instructions wherever they go. Li Zhiyong, the chairman of the county revolutionary committee and a revolutionary leading cadre, went to Wangjia Yuan Commune, more than 120 miles away from the county seat, last autumn, carrying his luggage and Lin Biao's speech at the celebration of the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. He visited all five production brigades in the commune. Everywhere he went, he participated in labor while propagating Lin Biao's instructions on establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and helped to implement them concretely. As a result, the Mao Zedong Thought study classes in this commune were established early and well. Before the wheat harvest last year, several production brigades in Wencheng and other communes suffered from hailstorms, and the masses were anxious. Several standing committee members took a group of cadres to these places, bringing copies of Chairman Mao's works, "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and portraits of Chairman Mao to the commune members. They studied "The Three Constantly Read Articles" with the commune members. The masses were greatly inspired and said, "Thousands of supports, tens of thousands of supports, sending Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest support. With Mao Zedong Thought, we are not afraid of any difficulties." After studying, the commune members worked hard, making up for the losses of the summer harvest, and achieved a bumper autumn harvest, ensuring no reduction in production despite the disaster.

Following the example of the standing committee members, many departments in the county have changed the old habit of staying in the office. The cadres have gone to various villages, closely connecting with the masses. Wherever there are more problems and difficulties, they go there. They work with the commune members during the day and study, fight against selfishness, and criticize revisionism with them at night. They propagate Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the commune members, who regard them as their confidants. Usually, three out of every five cadres in the county-level organs are active at the grassroots level. Over the past year, the county cadres have visited all 95 production brigades and 556 production teams. Last year, the county decided that each cadre should work for 60 days, and most cadres have completed this task ahead of schedule.

The result of Ji County Revolutionary Committee's close ties with the masses is that they have a clear understanding of the situation below and a clear view of the masses' opinions and demands. This spring, when the cadres were propagating and implementing the Central Committee's instructions on spring plowing and production in the countryside, they found that some grassroots cadres had erroneous thoughts such as complacency and relaxation. The county revolutionary committee then organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes to help the grassroots cadres use "The Three Constantly Read Articles" as a weapon to fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism, greatly improving the ideological awareness of the grassroots cadres and effectively promoting spring plowing and production.

Now, the Ji County Revolutionary Committee has established a relationship of mutual dependence with the masses. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members, with the attitude of masters, provide suggestions to the revolutionary committee and help it improve its work. The revolutionary committee also attaches great importance to the opinions and suggestions of the masses. They voluntarily place the revolutionary committee under the supervision of the masses, regarding the masses' opinions as care and help for the revolutionary committee, as a great support for the revolutionary committee. In addition to constantly seeking the masses' opinions when they go down to the countryside, they also regularly hold democratic life meetings, inviting representatives of the masses to the office to criticize and suggest improvements to the work of the revolutionary committee. Every time the county revolutionary committee holds a full meeting, they set aside a day for the representatives of the masses to give suggestions to the revolutionary committee. The members of the revolutionary committee are determined to follow the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction that "the most fundamental principle of reforming state organs is to connect with the masses," to further strengthen their ties with the masses, to think, speak, and work together with the masses, and to promote the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and socialist construction in the county forward.

    自觉地把革委会置于群众监督之下
    山西省吉县革命委员会改变领导作风，打破坐机关的老习惯，扎根到群众中去，同群众建立了鱼水相依的关系，得到了广大革命群众的极大信赖
    新华社太原二十二日电　山西省吉县革命委员会发扬党的艰苦奋斗、密切联系群众的传统作风，使革委会深深扎根于群众之中，得到了广大革命群众的极大信赖，同群众建立了鱼水相依的关系。
    吉县革命委员会去年四月成立后，革委会成员和工作人员，通过对中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派在机关工作中大搞机关化，使干部严重脱离群众、脱离实际的反革命修正主义路线的革命大批判，深刻地认识到，艰苦奋斗、密切联系群众，坚持从群众中来到群众中去的领导方法，是党的光荣传统，是毛主席的一贯教导。新生的革命委员会必须把革命的好传统发扬光大起来。县革委会还认真组织大家活学活用“老三篇”和吃忆苦饭、回忆家史和革命斗争史，来加强自己的群众观点，进一步实现领导班子的思想革命化。
    县革委会的成员，大多数是贫下中农出身，主要领导干部是抗战期间土生土长的老干部，和群众有着深厚的阶级感情。他们的阶级觉悟提高后，一致提出要发扬老八路作风，到群众中去，和群众同甘苦共呼吸，当好人民的勤务员。革委会的十五个常委，是工人的仍然坚持做工，是农民的仍然坚持种地，是学生的仍然坚持上课。常委中的革命领导干部，除留少数人在机关处理日常事务外，其余都深入基层，深入群众，在下面解决问题。他们肩背行李，带着毛主席著作，徒步从一个山村走到另一个山村，和贫下中农一起吃、住，一起学习，一起斗私批修，一起劳动，并且抢着干难活、脏活，保持一个普通劳动者的本色。
    县革命委员会的成员在深入基层、深入群众的过程中，认真突出无产阶级政治。他们和基层干部一起，大抓活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，大抓阶级斗争和人的思想革命化，大力宣传自力更生、奋发图强的大寨精神。过去，旧县委内的一小撮走资派，大搞“物质刺激”，“金钱挂帅”，他们下去“蹲点”，只抓粮棉油，不分敌我友，人蹲到那里，就把钱、化肥、设备带到那里。现在革委会的成员走到那里，就把毛泽东思想和毛主席的最新指示带到那里。县革委会主任、革命领导干部李志勇，去年秋天背着行李，带着林彪副主席在首都庆祝中华人民共和国成立十八周年大会上的讲话，来到离县城一百二十多里的王家原公社，跑遍了全公社五个大队。每到一地，他一边参加劳动，一边宣传林副主席讲话中关于大办毛泽东思想学习班的指示，并帮助具体落实，结果这个公社的毛泽东思想学习班办得又早又好。去年麦收前，文城等公社不少生产大队受了雹灾，群众情绪不安，几个常委就带了一批干部去到那里，送给社员们毛主席著作单行本、《毛主席语录》和毛主席像，和社员们一起学习“老三篇”。群众受到极大的鼓舞，他们感动地说：“千支援，万支援，送来毛泽东思想是最大的支援。有了毛泽东思想，我们什么困难也不怕。”经过学习，社员们鼓足干劲，以秋补夏，夺得了秋季大丰收，做到灾年不减产。
    在革委会常委们的带动下，县的许多部门改变了坐机关的老习惯，干部们纷纷深入各个山庄，密切联系群众，那里问题多困难大，他们就到那里去。他们白天和社员一起劳动，晚上和社员
  一起学习，一起斗私批修，向社员宣传毛泽东思想，传播毛主席的最新指示，群众也把他们看成是自己的贴心人。县级各机关经常有三分之二的干部在基层活动，一年来，县里干部跑遍了全县九十五个大队的五百五十六个生产队。去年县里决定每个干部劳动六十天，多数干部都超计划完成。
    吉县革委会密切联系群众的结果，对下面的情况摸得准，对群众的意见和要求看得清。今年春季，干部们在农村宣传落实中共中央关于春耕生产的指示时，发现有些基层干部存在着自满松劲情绪等错误思想。县革委会就大办毛泽东思想学习班，帮助基层干部以“老三篇”为武器斗私批修，大大提高了基层干部的思想认识，有力地推动了春耕生产。
    现在，吉县革委会和群众之间，建立了鱼水相依的关系。广大贫下中农和社员群众，以主人翁的姿态，向革委会提供意见，帮助革委会改进工作。革委会对群众的意见和建议也十分重视，他们自觉地把革委会置于群众的监督之下，把群众的意见看作是对革委会的爱护和帮助，是对革委会的重大支持。他们除在下乡时不断征求群众意见外，还定期召开民主生活会，请群众代表到机关来，对革委会的工作提出批评建议。县革命委员会每次开全体会议，都专门抽出一天时间，让群众代表给革委会提意见。革委会的成员，决心遵照伟大领袖毛主席“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众”的教导，不断进一步加强同群众的联系，同群众心往一处想，话往一处说，劲往一处使，推动全县的无产阶级文化大革命和社会主义建设滚滚向前。
