Not long ago, the Revolutionary Committee of the First Shaft of the Anti-Imperialist Coal Mine in Liaoyuan held a meeting. Revolutionary workers were invited to evaluate the committee members' achievements and shortcomings in emphasizing proletarian politics. The facts have proven that this is a good way to promote the ideological revolution of Revolutionary Committee members.

The Revolutionary Committee of the First Shaft of the Anti-Imperialist Coal Mine of the Liaoyuan Mining Bureau, with the help of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the shaft, recently held a meeting to emphasize proletarian politics. Revolutionary workers evaluated the committee members' achievements and shortcomings in this regard. The committee members received a vivid and profound education.

The Revolutionary Committee of the First Shaft was established in late January this year. On the day after its establishment, all members passed a resolution to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to take the path of emphasizing proletarian politics, and to turn the entire shaft into a red Mao Zedong Thought school. The resolution required each member to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, to thoroughly transform their worldview, and to serve the people wholeheartedly, becoming a model of close ties with the masses.

At the beginning, the members took the resolution very seriously. No matter how busy or how much work they had, they would make time to go among the masses, study Chairman Mao's works with the workers, and labor together. The workers praised them as good servants of the people. However, after some time, some members began to relax in executing the resolution, spending all day on administrative tasks and less time among the masses. Some even developed a bit of "officialdom." The workers raised some opinions. The Revolutionary Committee held two heart-to-heart meetings, conducted criticism and self-criticism, and the situation improved somewhat. However, because the soul-searching was not deep enough, the problem was not fundamentally solved.

The comrades from the Propaganda Team decided to help the Revolutionary Committee solve this problem. Political instructor Xie Endong came up with a few plans and discussed them with the comrades who were supporting the left. One comrade suggested, "Don't we hold evaluations of cadres' emphasis on politics a few times a year? Each evaluation has greatly promoted the ideological revolution of the cadres. Can't we suggest to the comrades of the Revolutionary Committee that they also, like the platoons, organize the workers to evaluate the Revolutionary Committee members' achievements and shortcomings in emphasizing politics?"

Xie Endong thought this was a good idea and went to discuss it with the comrades of the Revolutionary Committee. The Revolutionary Committee decided to hold an evaluation meeting.

This was the first time such a meeting was held at the First Shaft. To ensure the success of this meeting, the comrades from the Propaganda Team, together with the members of the Revolutionary Committee, studied Chairman Mao's teachings on serving the people and repeatedly propagated the significance of holding a successful evaluation meeting. Everyone realized that inviting the masses to evaluate was not to make anyone look bad, but to ask the masses to be teachers, helping to sweep away the political dust on oneself, ensuring that one always follows Chairman Mao and always sails in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao. Some committee members said: The masses are the true heroes, and revolutionary masses are the masters of the mine. The masses elected us to the Revolutionary Committee, requiring us to be their representatives. How well we perform as representatives, whether we truly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and take the path of emphasizing proletarian politics, the revolutionary workers have the right to criticize and supervise at any time, and the members of the Revolutionary Committee have the duty to accept the masses' supervision and criticism. This is the new style that the newly born Revolutionary Committee should have.

To ensure the success of this evaluation meeting, the comrades from the Propaganda Team also studied Chairman Mao's teachings with the workers: "Regarding our work, to affirm everything or to negate everything is one-sidedness.... To affirm everything is to see only the good and not the bad, to praise only and not to criticize. To say that our work is all good does not conform to the facts. It is not that everything is good; there are still shortcomings and errors. But it is also not that everything is bad; this does not conform to the facts. It must be analyzed." At the evaluation meeting, representatives from various units followed Chairman Mao's teachings, using the dialectical method, starting from supporting and cherishing the Revolutionary Committee, affirming the achievements of the committee members while pointing out their shortcomings. The criticism was both serious and profound, and the language was both heavy and sincere.

Some committee members worked very enthusiastically. Since the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, they had not rested for a single day, wholeheartedly wanting to do a good job. However, for a period of time, due to being busy with meetings and handling daily administrative work, they could not deeply enter the coal mining front line, had not seriously grasped the mass political and ideological work, and had not strongly resisted some wrong trends. Regarding this issue, some workers said at the evaluation meeting: "Comrades, we workers know that you are working hard for us. However, this way of being busy is not in line with Chairman Mao's teachings. Chairman Mao wants you to believe in the masses and rely on the masses; you can't just have a few people busy like this!" The workers also suggested that the Revolutionary Committee should hold short meetings and speak briefly in the future, freeing the committee members from the circle of meetings and administrative tasks, and going to the workers more often to see the situation, mobilizing everyone to do political and ideological work, and making the revolution and production even better.

The workers, with deep class feelings, talked about the achievements of the Revolutionary Committee members, pointed out their shortcomings, and expressed their hopes. This was a great encouragement and motivation for the committee members. One committee member, who was previously a leader of a revolutionary mass organization, had high work enthusiasm after joining the Revolutionary Committee, often eating and living in the mine, and not being able to take care of family matters. However, due to not grasping the study and application of Chairman Mao's works tightly, the self-awareness of transforming the worldview was not high, and some "officialdom" was developed. The living room at home was a bit crowded, and he wanted the Revolutionary Committee to adjust it; seeing that his office desk was a bit old, he thought it was not dignified and planned to have the logistics group change it. The workers said in the evaluation that he worked enthusiastically and had revolutionary spirit; however, the root of serving the people wholeheartedly was not firmly established, and behind the work for the revolution, there were still plans for "me," which was poisoned by the "public-private" theory of the Chinese Khrushchev. One worker said earnestly to him: "Comrade! You are our representative of revolutionary workers and should always think of yourself as a servant of the people. Never think of yourself as an official! Changing a room and a desk seems trivial, but you must never change the nature of the working people!" This committee member was deeply moved by these words. He immediately checked his erroneous thoughts and expressed to his comrades that he would definitely study Chairman Mao's books diligently in the future, change his thoughts, and always maintain the spirit of hard struggle, always keeping his heart connected with the masses.

This evaluation meeting was very successful. The members of the Revolutionary Committee, based on the workers' evaluations, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works with problems in mind, fought against selfishness and criticized revisionism, and with the help of the Propaganda Team, revised the revolutionary measures again. Their ideological style improved significantly. The members of the Revolutionary Committee said: Such meetings should be held regularly in the future, so that the Revolutionary Committee can play a greater role in leading the broad revolutionary masses to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    促进革委会成员思想革命化的好办法
    吉林省辽源矿务局反帝煤矿一井革命委员会，不久以前，在驻井解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，开了一次突出无产阶级政治的讲评会，请革命职工对革委会委员们在突出政治方面的成绩和缺点，作了一次讲评。委员们受到了一次生动的深刻的教育。
    一井革委会是今年一月下旬建立的。在它诞生后的第二天，全体委员通过的第一个决议，就是要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，走突出无产阶级政治的道路，把全井办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。决议要求每个委员都要活学活用毛主席著作，彻底改造世界观，全心全意地为人民服务，成为紧密联系群众的模范。
    开始，委员们对这个决议执行很认真。不管工作再多再忙，他们都要挤时间到群众中去，同工人一起学习毛主席著作，一起劳动。职工们称赞他们是人民的好勤务员。可是，过了一些日子，有的委员对执行决议有些放松，整天忙于事务，深入群众少了。有的人还滋长了一些“官气”。职工们提出了一些意见。革委会也开了两次交心会，开展批评和自我批评，情况有所好转。但是，由于触及灵魂不深，问题没有从根本上解决。
    宣传队的同志决心帮助革委会解决这个问题。指导员谢恩东设想了几个方案，找支左的同志一道研究。有的同志提出：“咱们每年不是都要发动战士对干部突出政治的情况讲评几次吗？每次讲评，对干部的思想革命化都起到了很大的推动作用。咱们能不能向革委会的同志建议，请他们也象连队那样，发动职工对革委会成员突出政治的成绩和缺点讲评一次呢？”谢恩东觉得大家的意见很对，就去找革委会的同志交换意见。革委会决定召开一次讲评会。
    开这样的会，在一井还是头一次。为了开好这次会，宣传队的同志同革委会成员一起学习毛主席为人民服务的教导，反复宣传开好讲评会的意义。大家认识到，请群众讲评，不是给谁难看，而是请群众当老师，帮助自己扫除身上的政治灰尘，保证永远紧跟毛主席，永远沿着毛主席指引的航向前进。有些委员说：群众是真正的英雄，革命群众是矿山的主人。群众把我们选到革委会里来，是要求我们作他们的代表。我们这个代表当得怎么样，是不是真正高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，走突出无产阶级政治的道路，革命职工有权利随时批评、监督，革委会成员有义务接受群众的监督、批评。这正是新生的革委会应有的新风格。
    为了开好这次讲评会，宣传队的同志还同职工们一起学习毛主席的教导：“对于我们的工作的看法，肯定一切或者否定一切，都是片面性的。……肯定一切，就是只看到好的，看不到坏的，只能赞扬，不能批评。说我们的工作似乎一切都好，这不合乎事实。不是一切都好，还有缺点和错误。但是也不是一切都坏，这也不合乎事实。要加以分析。”在讲评会上，各单位的代表遵照毛主席的教导，用一分为二的观点，从支持和爱护革委会出发，既肯定革委会成员的成绩，又指出他们的缺点，批评既严肃深刻，又语重心长。
    有些委员工作十分热情，革委会成立以来，没有休息过一天，一心一意想搞好工作。但是，有段时间，由于忙于开会，忙于处理日常事务工作，不能很好地深入采煤第一线，对群众性的政治思想工作没有认真地抓起来，对有些歪风邪气抵制不力。对于这个问题，有的工人在讲评会上说：“同志们辛辛苦苦为我们服务，这点我们工人是知道的。但是，你们这样的忙法，是不符合毛主席的教导的。毛主席要你们相信群众，依靠群众，你们可不能少数人空忙啊！”工人们还建议革委会今后要开短会，说短话，把委员们从会议圈子和事务圈子里解放出来，多到职工群众中去走一走，看一看，发动大家都来做政治思想工作，把革命和生产搞得更好。
    职工们满怀阶级感情，给革委会的同志们谈成绩，指缺点，提希望，对委员们是极大的鼓励和鞭策。有个委员，过去是革命群众组织的负责人。到革委会以后，工作积极性很高，经常吃在井上，住在井上，家里有事也顾不得照料。但是，由于活学活用毛主席著作抓得不紧，改造世界观的自觉性不高，沾染了“官气”。家里住房挤了一点，要革委会给调整；见自己的办公桌破旧一些，认为不体面，打算叫后勤组的同志给换换。工人们在讲评时，说他工作积极，有革命干劲；可是，全心全意为人民服务的思想根子扎得还不牢，在为革命工作的背后，还有为“我”的打算，这是中了中国赫鲁晓夫“大公有私”论的毒害。有位工人语重心长地对他说：“同志啊！你是咱们革命工人的代表，要时时刻刻想到自己是人民的勤务员，可千万不要以为是当官啊！换一间房子，换一张桌子，看来事小，可千万不能换掉劳动人民的本色啊！”这个委员听了这些话，很受感动。他当场检查了自己的错误思想，并向同志们表示，今后一定要刻苦地读毛主席的书，好好改造思想，永远保持艰苦奋斗的作风，永远同群众心连心。
    这次讲评会开得很成功。革委会委员们根据职工们的讲评，带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，斗私批修，在宣传队的帮助下，重新修订了革命化的措施，思想作风有了很大改进。革委会委员们说：这样的会，今后要经常开，使革委会在带领广大革命群众夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的进军中，发挥更大的威力。
