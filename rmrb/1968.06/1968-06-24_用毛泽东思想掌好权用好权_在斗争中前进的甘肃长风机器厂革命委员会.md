Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The basic experience of the revolutionary committees is threefold: one is the representation of revolutionary cadres, one is the representation of the military, and one is the representation of revolutionary masses, achieving the three-in-one combination of the revolution. The revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative structures, streamline and reduce bureaucracy, and organize a revolutionary leadership team that is connected with the masses." Chairman Mao's latest important directive points out the fundamental direction for the construction of revolutionary committees.

Since its establishment in late October last year, the Revolutionary Committee of Longfeng Machinery Factory has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized proletarian politics, actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works and his latest series of directives, taken class struggle as the key, and vigorously carried out the revolution's criticism and reform within the unit. It has actively and continuously launched attacks on class enemies, bringing about tremendous changes in the entire factory. Mao Zedong Thought has been widely promoted, and the broad revolutionary masses are spirited and full of fighting spirit. The revolution and production have shown a great and good situation.

Learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental task of the revolutionary committee.

After the establishment of the factory revolutionary committee, there were numerous tasks at hand. Initially, some leading members had unclear thoughts and once fell into the trap of administrative affairs, relaxing the emphasis on actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works. The PLA support-left personnel stationed in the factory discovered this problem and believed that after the establishment of the factory revolutionary committee, the key issue was what path to take. To raise the awareness of the factory revolutionary committee members, unify thoughts, and integrate the three forces of revolutionary cadres, military, and revolutionary masses into one, making the revolutionary committee truly a strong fighting command post for upholding Mao Zedong Thought, the PLA support-left personnel promptly helped the factory revolutionary committee hold a Mao Zedong Thought study class for the revolutionary committee. In the study class, the leading members concentrated on studying Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles," "On the Rectification of the Party's Work Style," "On Correcting Erroneous Ideas in the Party," and a series of latest directives, as well as relevant directives from Vice Chairman Lin Biao. Vice Chairman Lin Biao said: "Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all work of the Party, the army, and the nation." "Forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, arm the minds of the people of the entire nation with Mao Zedong Thought, and insist on Mao Zedong Thought taking the lead in all work is the most fundamental task of our Party's political and ideological work." Through the study, they unanimously agreed: "If the revolutionary committee does not grasp the fundamental task of actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, it is the greatest disloyalty to Chairman Mao." Some comrades deeply realized that whether they lead in arming their minds with Mao Zedong Thought and carrying out ideological revolutionization is not only a personal issue but a major issue concerning whether the proletarian revolutionary power can be consolidated. Mao Zedong Thought illuminated the direction for the revolutionary committee's advance, giving everyone great encouragement and strength. From then on, the revolutionary committee placed the active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works and his latest series of directives in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, prior to everything, and more important than everything. The entire factory, from top to bottom, quickly established the institution of reading Chairman Mao's works "every day without fail," achieving "unshakable" results. Thus, a momentum of the masses actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, with leaders taking the lead in learning and speaking, quickly formed throughout the factory. In the process of vigorously promoting the active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works, they always regarded the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest series of directives as a fundamental issue of loyalty to Chairman Mao, achieving close, swift, and good follow-up of each of Chairman Mao's latest directives. In accordance with Chairman Mao's great directive to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" and to hold study classes, the factory revolutionary committee launched a campaign throughout the factory to establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes and to criticize selfishness and revisionism. Now, the factory has held over 180 study classes of various types, promoting the ideological revolutionization of the people and further consolidating and developing the great unity of the revolution and the three-in-one combination of the revolution.

Organizing a revolutionary leadership team connected with the masses

After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, how to quickly implement Chairman Mao's latest directive to "organize a revolutionary leadership team connected with the masses" was a primary issue. The experience of the Revolutionary Committee of Longfeng Machinery Factory is: in accordance with Chairman Mao's great teaching of "not breaking means not establishing," holding high the revolutionary banner of criticizing Mao Zedong Thought, deeply exposing and criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of management pushed by China's Khrushchev, eliminating its poison, and breaking down overlapping administrative structures, building the revolutionary committee to better meet the needs of the socialist economic base and better meet the needs of consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing capitalist restoration. After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, the bureaucratic style of work left over from the old system and old forces of habit still sometimes influenced the members of the revolutionary committee. The leading members of the revolutionary committee all felt that the work was busy and chaotic. Even the revolutionary mass representatives within the revolutionary committee had once floated to the surface, falling into the trap of administrative affairs, and the tendency to detach from the masses began to emerge. Workers criticized this phenomenon. The sharp criticism from the masses timely sounded the alarm for the leading members of the revolutionary committee. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest directives on revolutionary committees, realizing that implementing streamlining and reducing bureaucracy and reforming the old administrative management system is a serious class struggle and a struggle between two lines. If it is not thoroughly reformed, it will follow the old path, produce bureaucratism, and detach from the masses. Only by thoroughly changing it in terms of ideology, organization, and system can the fundamental issue of the revolutionary committee's connection with the masses be solved, bureaucratism and revisionism be prevented, and unified leadership be implemented, fundamentally consolidating the newly born revolutionary committee.

No matter how difficult, relying on the masses makes it easy. The factory revolutionary committee, based on the opinions of the masses and with the active participation of the broad revolutionary masses, after serious discussion, abolished all the cumbersome and overlapping departments, bureaus, and offices of the original factory-level party and government organs, establishing the Political Department, Production Command Department, Logistics Department, and Office, reducing the number of full-time cadres and managerial personnel in the entire factory by 72% compared to the original.

After the organizational reform, the leading members of the revolutionary committee and a large number of cadres and technical personnel broke free from the circle of administrative affairs, quickly changing their work style. They happily went to the production frontline, humbly learning from the workers, taking the lead in participating in production labor, making many workshops' revolution and production lively. Except for a few standing committee members who take turns being on duty to handle overall work, the other committee members all went to the production frontline, participated in production labor, being both "officials" and "common people," receiving praise from the broad revolutionary masses.

The factory revolutionary committee led the masses to break down the old system, thoroughly revolutionizing the old system, breaking the old framework that this factory, under the manipulation of some bourgeois experts since its establishment, could only produce products in the fourth quarter of each year, creating for the first time the thriving new situation of producing products every month and every season. Workers excitedly said: "In the past, a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party established factory management on the 'control' of the worker masses. They used the revisionist approach to control, the more they controlled, the more chaotic the production became. Now, the newly born revolutionary committee establishes factory management on the 'rely' principle, relying on Mao Zedong Thought from above and the broad revolutionary masses from below, resulting in better and better production."

In the storm of class struggle, consolidating and developing the revolutionary committee

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power, consolidating power. And the counter-revolutionaries' desperate struggle against the revolutionary forces is also entirely for maintaining their power." The Revolutionary Committee of Longfeng Machinery Factory deeply felt from the practice of struggle that the revolutionary committee born in the storm of class struggle must be tempered and tested in the storm of class struggle, thereby establishing proletarian revolutionary authority, making it consolidated and developed.

Soon after the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of Longfeng Machinery Factory, class enemies showed great hostility towards it. They madly shouted: "The issue of who wins and who loses has not been decided yet." They adopted open or covert methods, spreading malicious rumors and igniting evil fires everywhere, creating counter-revolutionary public opinion, attempting to overthrow the newly born revolutionary committee, overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat, and restore capitalism.

To severely strike down a handful of class enemies and defend the proletarian revolutionary power, the factory revolutionary committee first vigorously carried out class education of recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness, organizing the broad revolutionary masses to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's latest directives: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a great political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under socialist conditions, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its led broad revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." They also gathered various counter-revolutionary evidence preserved by hidden Kuomintang reactionary officers and spies and held a class struggle exhibition. Through study and recalling bitterness education, everyone more deeply realized: a handful of class enemies hiding in the revolutionary ranks are the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, representing the interests of imperialism, Kuomintang reactionaries, the bourgeoisie, and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. Our struggle against these counter-revolutionary elements is a sharp, complex, and life-or-death class struggle. These hidden class enemies must be thoroughly exposed and severely struck; we must not be lenient.

On the basis of raising awareness, the entire factory quickly launched a new high tide of mass exposure, criticism, and struggle, quickly digging out one by one a handful of hidden traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and counter-revolutionaries, exposing their ugly faces in broad daylight.

To stably, accurately, and severely strike down class enemies, all leading members of the factory revolutionary committee went to the frontline of class struggle, participated in and commanded the battle, timely paying attention to investigating and understanding the situation, grasping the new situation, new characteristics, and new trends of class struggle, firmly grasping the overall direction of the struggle, and always directing the spearhead at a handful of class enemies. When the revolutionary committee discovered that some masses, deceived and used by class enemies, had heavy thoughts and had said and done some wrong things, it started from class education, patiently did ideological and political work, encouraging them to bravely stand up and turn against the enemy. Thus, the entire factory quickly organized a vast revolutionary army, completely isolating a handful of class enemies. After going through the severe tempering and testing of class struggle and line struggle, the factory revolutionary committee became more solid and consolidated. The revolution and production of the entire factory also presented a lively and thriving new situation.

Now, the factory revolutionary committee is leading the broad revolutionary masses of the entire factory to hold higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize proletarian politics, take class struggle as the key, vigorously establish and run Mao Zedong Thought study classes, comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest directives, more deeply carry out the revolution's criticism, launch more fierce attacks on class enemies, and continuously strengthen military-civilian unity and unity between cadres and the masses, strive for the best, catch up, and make continuous efforts to achieve the overall victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

### 用毛泽东思想掌好权用好权——在斗争中前进的甘肃长风机器厂革命委员会

    用毛泽东思想掌好权用好权
    ——在斗争中前进的甘肃长风机器厂革命委员会
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：“革命委员会的基本经验有三条：一条是有革命干部的代表，一条是有军队的代表，一条是有革命群众的代表，实现了革命的三结合。革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”毛主席的这一最新重要指示，为革命委员会的建设指出了根本的方向。
    长风机器厂革命委员会从去年十月下旬建立以来，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，活学活用毛主席著作和毛主席的一系列最新指示，以阶级斗争为纲，狠抓革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改，主动地、不停顿地向阶级敌人发动进攻，使全厂面貌发生了巨大的变化，毛泽东思想空前大普及，广大革命职工精神焕发，斗志昂扬，革命和生产出现了一片大好形势。
    学好用好毛泽东思想是革命委员会的根本任务
    厂革委会成立后，面临的工作千头万绪，究竟抓什么？开始，一些领导成员思想不够明确，曾一度陷入事务圈子里，放松了抓活学活用毛主席著作。解放军驻厂支左人员发现了这个问题，认为厂革委会建立后主要抓什么问题，实质上是走什么道路的大问题。为了提高厂革委会成员的认识，统一思想，使革命干部的代表、军队的代表、革命群众的代表这三股力量拧成一股绳，把革委会真正办成大立毛泽东思想的坚强战斗指挥部，解放军支左人员及时帮助厂革委会举办了革委会毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里，领导成员集中学习了毛主席的“老三篇”、《学习和时局》、《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等光辉著作和一系列最新指示，学习了林彪副主席的有关指示。林彪副主席说：“毛泽东思想是全党、全军和全国一切工作的指导方针。”“永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，用毛泽东思想武装全国人民的头脑，坚持在一切工作中用毛泽东思想挂帅，是我党政治思想工作最根本的任务。”通过学习，他们一致认为：“革委会不抓活学活用毛泽东思想这个根本，就是对毛主席最大的不忠。”还有一些同志深刻认识到，自己是不是带头用毛泽东思想武装头脑，搞好思想革命化，这不仅是关系到个人的问题，而是关系到无产阶级革命政权能不能巩固的大问题。毛泽东思想照亮了革委会前进的方向，给了大家以巨大的鼓舞和力量。从此，革委会把活学活用毛主席著作和一系列最新指示，放在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的地位，全厂从上到下迅速建立了毛主席著作“天天读”的制度，做到了“雷打不动”。这样，一个领导带头学、带头讲用的群众性活学活用毛主席著作的热潮，便在全厂迅速形成。他们在狠抓活学活用毛主席著作中，始终把贯彻落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，看作是忠于毛主席的根本大节问题，做到了对毛主席的每一条最新指示跟得紧，跟得快，跟得好。遵照毛主席“要斗私，批修”和办学习班的伟大指示，厂革委会在全厂发动群众，掀起了一个大办毛泽东思想学习班和斗私批修的高潮。现在，全厂已办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班一百八十多期，促进了人的思想革命化，进一步巩固和发展了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。
    组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子
    革命委员会成立后，如何迅速落实毛主席的“组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”的最新指示，是个首要问题。长风机器厂革命委员会的体会是：遵照毛主席的“不破不立”的伟大教导，高举毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，深刻揭露和批判中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的反革命修正主义办厂路线，肃清其流毒，打破重叠的行政机构，把革委会建设得更加适应社会主义经济基础的需要，更加适应巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟的需要。革命委员会成立后，旧机构遗留下来的官僚主义作风，旧的习惯势力，还不时地影响着革委会的成员。革委会的领导成员都感到工作忙，头绪乱。甚至连革委会中的革命群众代表，也曾一度浮在上面，陷入了事务圈子，脱离群众的倾向开始萌芽。工人们对这种现象提出了批评。来自群众的尖锐批评，及时给革委会的领导成员敲起了警钟。他们又反复学习了毛主席关于革命委员会的最新指示，认识到实行精兵简政，改革旧的行政管理机构，是一场严肃的阶级斗争和两条路线的斗争。如果不彻底改革，就会走老路，就会产生官僚主义，脱离群众。只有从思想上、组织上和制度上彻底地改，才能从根本上解决革委会联系群众的问题，才能防止官僚主义和修正主义，才能实行一元化的领导，从根本上巩固新生的革委会。
    千难万难，依靠群众就不难。厂革委会根据群众的意见，在广大革命职工的积极参加下，经过认真讨论后，把原厂级党政机关的庞大重叠的部、科、室全部撤销，建立了政治部、生产指挥部、后勤部和办公室，使全厂脱产干部和管理人员比原来减少百分之七十二。
    机构改革后，使革委会的领导成员和大批干部、技术人员摆脱了行政事务的圈子，迅速转变了工作作风。他们愉快地走上生产第一线，虚心拜工人为师，带头参加生产劳动，使许多车间的革命和生产出现了活跃局面。革委会除几名常委实行轮流值班，主持全盘工作外，其余委员都深入生产第一线，参加生产劳动，“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”，得到了广大革命职工的好评。
    厂革委会领导群众，破字当头，对旧机构进行彻底的革命，打破了这个厂从建厂以来在一些资产阶级专家的操纵下，每年拖到第四季度才能出产品的老框框，第一次创造了月月出产品、季季出产品的蓬勃发展的新景象。工人们激动地说：“过去党内一小撮走资派把办厂建立在对工人群众的‘管’字上，他们用修正主义的那一套来管，越管生产越乱。现在，新生的革委会，把办厂建立在‘靠’字上，上靠毛泽东思想，下靠广大革命群众，结果生产越来越好。”
    在阶级斗争的暴风雨中巩固和发展革委会
    毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”长风机器厂革委会从斗争实践中深刻地体会到，在阶级斗争暴风雨中诞生的革委会，一定要在阶级斗争暴风雨中经受锻炼和考验，从而树立起无产阶级的革命权威，使它得到巩固和发展。
    长风机器厂革委会刚刚成立，阶级敌人就对它十分仇视。他们疯狂叫嚣：“现在谁胜谁负的问题还没有定。”他们采取公开或隐蔽的方式，到处煽阴风，点邪火，大造反革命舆论，妄图颠覆新生的革委会，推翻无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义。
    为了狠狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，保卫无产阶级的革命政权，厂革委会首先狠抓了忆苦思甜的阶级教育，组织广大革命职工群众反复学习了毛主席的最新指示：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”他们还把暗藏的国民党反动军官、特务保存的各种反革命罪证集中起来，举办了阶级斗争展览会。通过学习和忆苦教育，使大家更深刻地认识到：一小撮隐藏在革命队伍里的阶级敌人，都是国民党反动派的残渣余孽，他们是代表帝国主义、国民党反动派、资产阶级和地、富、反、坏、右的利益的。我们同这些反革命分子的斗争，是一场尖锐的、复杂的、你死我活的阶级斗争。对这些暗藏的阶级敌人必须彻底揭露，狠狠打击，决不能心慈手软。
    在提高认识的基础上，全厂迅速掀起了一个群众性的大揭发、大批判、大斗争的新高潮，很快把一小撮暗藏的叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派和反革命分子，一个个地挖了出来，使他们的丑恶面目暴露在光天化日之下。
    为了稳、准、狠地打击阶级敌人，厂革命委员会的全体领导成员，都深入阶级斗争第一线，参加战斗，指挥战斗，随时注意调查了解情况，掌握阶级斗争的新形势、新特点、新动向，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，把矛头始终对准一小撮阶级敌人。当革委会发现一些受阶级敌人欺骗、利用而说过一些错话，做过一些错事的群众思想包袱沉重的时候，便从阶级教育入手，耐心地做思想政治工作，鼓励他们勇敢地站出来反戈一击。这样就使全厂很快组织起了一支浩浩荡荡的革命大军，使一小撮阶级敌人完全孤立起来。厂革委会经过严峻的阶级斗争、路线斗争的锻炼和考验，更加坚强和巩固了。全厂革命和生产，也随着呈现出一派热气腾腾、蓬蓬勃勃的新景象。
    现在，厂革委会正在带领全厂广大革命职工，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，以阶级斗争为纲，大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，更加深入地开展革命的大批判，向阶级敌人发动更猛烈的进攻，同时不断加强军民团结和干群团结，鼓足干劲，力争上游，再接再厉，乘胜前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
