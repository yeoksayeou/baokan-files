The fascist military regime of Suharto and Nasution in Indonesia is terrified of the rising and developing armed struggle of the people of West Kalimantan, and is further colluding with the reactionary regime of the neo-colonialist puppet of the U.S. and Britain, "Malaysia," in an attempt to extinguish the people's revolutionary struggle in the region through counter-revolutionary joint military actions.

According to a report by Western news agencies on the 5th, citing the Jakarta *Armed Forces News*, the Indonesian fascist military regime and the "Malaysia" reactionary regime recently jointly plotted a large-scale "sweeping operation" in 1969 to suppress the armed forces of the people of West Kalimantan. The report said that this "sweeping operation" will also "target the remnants of a movement that fights against the incorporation of Sarawak and Sabah into Malaysia." This means that the Indonesian fascist military regime will, together with the "Malaysia" reactionary regime, suppress the North Kalimantan people's guerrilla forces who are bravely fighting for national liberation.

The Indonesian fascist military regime and the "Malaysia" reactionary regime began joint suppression of the North Kalimantan people's just struggle for national liberation as early as last March. After the people of West Kalimantan ignited the "spark" of armed revolutionary struggle in July last year, the military collusion between the two sides became increasingly close. According to reports, the commander of the Indonesian West Kalimantan military region, Witono, revealed on the 4th that the counter-revolutionary collusion between the Indonesian fascist military regime and the "Malaysia" reactionary regime to suppress the people's armed forces has "developed to the level of logistics and intelligence work."

In the past year, the Indonesian fascist military regime has been beaten black and blue by the armed forces of the people of West Kalimantan, and is at its wits' end. Now, its attempt to join forces with the insignificant reactionary armed forces of "Malaysia" to eliminate the armed forces of the people of West Kalimantan is doomed to failure. This will only promote the further development of the people's revolutionary struggle in the region.

    妄图扑灭西加里曼丹人民革命烈火
    印尼反动派同“马来西亚”加紧军事勾结
    新华社九日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权对西加里曼丹人民武装斗争的兴起和发展怕得要死，正进一步勾结美英新殖民主义工具“马来西亚”反动当局，妄图用反革命的联合军事行动来扑灭这个地区的人民革命斗争。
    据西方通讯社五日援引雅加达《武装部队报》的消息透露，印尼法西斯军人政权和“马来西亚”反动当局最近共同策划了一九六九年“扫荡”西加里曼丹人民武装力量的“大规模行动”。消息说，这个“扫荡行动”还将“针对为反对把沙捞越和沙巴并入马来西亚而斗争的一个运动的残余分子”。这就是，印尼法西斯军人政权还将伙同“马来西亚”反动当局镇压为争取民族解放而英勇战斗的北加里曼丹人民游击队。
    印尼法西斯军人政权同“马来西亚”反动当局早在去年三月就开始联合镇压北加里曼丹人民争取民族解放的正义斗争。去年七月，西加里曼丹人民点起了革命武装斗争的“星星之火”以后，双方的军事勾结便日益紧密。据报道，印尼西加里曼丹军区司令维托诺四日透露，印尼法西斯军人政权同“马来西亚”反动当局联合镇压人民武装力量的反革命勾结“已发展到后勤事务和情报工作方面”。
    印尼法西斯军人政权在过去一年中被西加里曼丹人民武装力量打得焦头烂额，招架不了。现在它想联合“马来西亚”的一支微不足道的反动武装来消灭西加里曼丹人民武装的企图肯定是不能得逞的，这只会促进这个地区的人民革命斗争的进一步发展。
