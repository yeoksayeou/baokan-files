The revolutionary workers of Beijing New China Printing Factory have recently created a new form of struggle – the revolutionary criticism site meeting – amidst the increasingly intense revolutionary criticism in the entire factory.

A revolutionary criticism site meeting has begun. The meeting hall is filled with the sound of battle cries:

“Down with the Chinese Khrushchev!”
“Down with the Chinese Khrushchev’s agents in our factory!”
“Never forget class struggle!”
“Press on to victory and seize complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!”

People follow the sound to a plot of land next to the factory’s repair and manufacturing workshop. Through the dense crowd of emotionally charged people, one can see various exhibits and charts. Among them are the black books and black paintings that the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents printed while opposing the printing of the brilliant works of our great leader Chairman Mao; there are machines and materials that were imported and imitated in disorder by a small clique of capitalist roaders in the factory, leading to waste; there are state resources squandered by relying on a few bourgeois reactionary “authorities” in technology, suppressing the creativity of revolutionary workers; there are facts showing their sabotage of the socialist planned economy and their promotion of capitalist “freedom.” Revolutionary workers, in front of these exhibits and charts, engage in face-to-face criticism and struggle against a small clique of capitalist roaders and bourgeois reactionary “authorities” in the factory, and angrily expose and criticize the crimes of their black backer – the Chinese Khrushchev. At the entrance of this plot of land, a large, eye-catching banner is hung, reading: Revolutionary Criticism Site Meeting.

In the meeting hall, on top of a pile of black books and black paintings, a chart is posted. This chart uses numbers to explain how the capitalist roaders in this factory, from 1962 to 1965, following the instructions of the Chinese Khrushchev, suppressed the printing of Chairman Mao’s works while printing large quantities of the black “Self-Cultivation” and other black books by the Chinese Khrushchev. These crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents against the great Mao Zedong Thought have aroused the intense hatred of the revolutionary workers. They point to these black books, black paintings, and charts, tightly surrounding the capitalist roaders in the factory, and denouncing their counter-revolutionary crimes. Faced with ironclad facts, a small clique of capitalist roaders in the factory cannot deny their crimes and have to admit their guilt.

Just as people are drawn to this battleground, nearby suddenly erupts with shouts of “Down with the Chinese Khrushchev!” It turns out that the workers are gathering around another set of exhibits and charts, fiercely criticizing the counter-revolutionary crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in promoting capitalist “freedom.” A small clique of capitalist roaders in this factory, following the black instructions of the Chinese Khrushchev, while suppressing the printing of Chairman Mao’s works by revolutionary workers, misused the state’s machines, funds, and materials to print cloth and comic books, and even to raise flowers, set up photo studios, and sell ice pops, making the socialist factory a chaotic mess.

The workers, after seeing the exhibits and illustrative charts, recall the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the factory before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and their hearts burn with anger. They point to a few capitalist roaders in the factory and angrily denounce: “You are indeed the agents of the Chinese Khrushchev! We see through you completely! You did not let us print Chairman Mao’s Little Red Book, intending to drag our factory back to capitalism, but we will never agree!” Some workers say: “You bastards commit crimes and rely on the Chinese Khrushchev to back you up! Down with the black backer of the capitalist roaders in our factory – the Chinese Khrushchev!”

The shouts of “Down with the Chinese Khrushchev!” rise and fall throughout the revolutionary criticism site meeting. A small clique of capitalist roaders in the factory, facing a large number of material evidence, have received serious criticism and struggle from the revolutionary workers. The meeting hall is filled with a strong atmosphere of struggle. Each piece of material evidence on display is a bullet aimed at the Chinese Khrushchev and a small clique of capitalist roaders in the factory, and a good teaching material for the workers to criticize and repudiate themselves and the revisionism. These materials make the workers, while using the great Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to carry out revolutionary criticism, more concretely feel the counter-revolutionary crimes of a small clique of capitalist roaders in the factory, more concretely link these people’s black backer – the Chinese Khrushchev’s counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and have even greater hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, and even greater love for the great leader Chairman Mao. The workers say: “We didn’t know until we saw it, and we were shocked when we saw it. After seeing the material evidence displayed at the site meeting, we have even more clearly recognized the counter-revolutionary faces of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents!” Some workers, while watching, say: “The revolutionary criticism site meeting is great! It exposes the counter-revolutionary crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents alive and in broad daylight, making us even more hateful of the Chinese Khrushchev and more energetic in criticizing him!” Many revolutionary workers at this revolutionary criticism site meeting are excitedly expressing their determination to forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, never forget class struggle, and carry the political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes to the end.

The revolutionary criticism site meeting is a new battlefield opened by the revolutionary workers of Beijing New China Printing Factory, with the help of the PLA leftist support personnel stationed in the factory, to further carry out revolutionary criticism. Before this, they followed the great leader Chairman Mao’s instructions of “never forget class struggle” and “one of our important tasks on the ideological front is to carry out a criticism of revisionism,” combining various tasks and using various opportunities, deeply and persistently carrying out revolutionary criticism. They criticized in large meetings, small meetings, study classes, workshops, offices, on big-character posters, through wired broadcasts, workers criticized, family members criticized, everyone criticized the Chinese Khrushchev, and everywhere was a battlefield for criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev. Under the continuous deepening of this mass revolutionary criticism, about a month ago, the new form of struggle – the revolutionary criticism site meeting – was first created by the workers of the repair and manufacturing workshop with the help of the PLA leftist support personnel.

After the appearance of the revolutionary criticism site meeting in the repair and manufacturing workshop, it quickly attracted the attention of all the PLA leftist support personnel and revolutionary workers in the factory. They believe that the greatest advantage of this form of struggle is that it can concretely and vividly expose the counter-revolutionary crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the factory, making people more clearly recognize the reactionary faces of these class enemies and further heighten their awareness of class struggle, two-line struggle, and the self-awareness of carrying out revolutionary criticism. They say, the counter-revolutionary crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents against the party, against socialism, against Mao Zedong Thought, and attempting to restore capitalism, have a large amount of evidence; the revolutionary criticism site meeting is a good way to concentrate their numerous crimes and expose them in broad daylight. Therefore, all the workshops and departments in the factory, based on the experience of the repair and manufacturing workshop, carried out an activity of exposing the evil results of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line and displaying the evidence of their crimes in promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the mass revolutionary criticism, quickly organizing a factory-wide revolutionary criticism site meeting, and on this new battlefield, fanning the flames of revolutionary criticism even higher.

    把革命大批判的烈火烧得更旺
    ——记北京新华印刷厂的革命大批判现场会
    北京新华印刷厂的革命职工，最近在全厂越来越旺的革命大批判烈火中，创造了一种新的斗争形式——革命大批判现场会。
    一次革命大批判现场会开始了。会场上频频传出战斗的口号声：
    “打倒中国赫鲁晓夫！”
    “打倒中国赫鲁晓夫在我厂的代理人！”
    “念念不忘阶级斗争！”
    “乘胜前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！”
    人们寻声来到这个厂修制车间旁边的一块场地上，透过情绪激愤的密集的人群，可以看到陈列着各种实物和图表，其中有中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在反对印制我们伟大领袖毛主席的光辉著作的同时拚命印制的黑书黑画；有厂内一小撮走资派崇拜洋货，乱进口、乱仿制而报废了的机器和原料、材料；有他们依靠少数资产阶级反动技术“权威”、压制革命职工的创造性而挥霍浪费的国家资材；有他们破坏社会主义计划经济、大搞资本主义“自由化”的事实材料。革命职工们在这些实物、图表面前，向厂内一小撮走资派和资产阶级反动技术“权威”进行面对面的批判斗争，并愤怒揭发、批判了他们的黑后台——中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命罪行。在这块场地的入口处，横挂着一幅醒目的大字标语，上面写着：革命大批判现场会。
    会场上，在一堆黑书黑画上面，贴着一张图表。这张图表用数字说明，这个工厂的走资派在一九六二年到一九六五年的四年里，秉承中国赫鲁晓夫的旨意，如何压制印制毛主席著作，而大量印刷中国赫鲁晓夫的黑《修养》等黑书。中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人反对伟大的毛泽东思想的这些罪证，激起了革命职工们的无比仇恨。他们指着这些黑书黑画和图表，把厂里的走资派紧紧地包围起来，控诉这些家伙的反革命罪行。在铁的事实面前，厂内一小撮走资派无法狡赖，不得不低头认罪。
    当人们正被这个战斗场面吸引的时候，附近突然又爆发出“打倒中国赫鲁晓夫”的怒吼声。原来，工人们正围拢着另一部分实物和图表，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人大搞资本主义“自由化”的反革命罪行。这个厂的一小撮走资派，根据中国赫鲁晓夫的黑旨意，在压制革命职工印制毛主席著作的同时，却滥用国家的机器、资金和原料、材料，去印花布和连环画，甚至养花弄草，开照相馆，造冰棍出售，真是五花八门，无奇不有，把一个社会主义的工厂搞得乌烟瘴气。
    工人们看了陈列的实物和示意图表，回想起无产阶级文化大革命前中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在厂里推行反革命修正主义路线的滔天罪行，满腔怒火涌上心头。他们指着厂里的几个走资派愤怒控诉：“你们真是中国赫鲁晓夫的代理人，我们完全把你们看透了！你们不让我们印毛主席的红宝书，原来是要想把我们的工厂拉回资本主义，我们坚决不答应！”有的工人说：“你们这些家伙作恶犯罪，原来是靠着中国赫鲁晓夫给你们撑腰！打倒我厂走资派的黑后台——中国赫鲁晓夫！”
    “打倒中国赫鲁晓夫”的怒吼声，在整个革命大批判现场会上此起彼落。厂内一小撮走资派，在大量实物罪证面前，受到了革命职工们的严肃批判、斗争。会场上战斗气氛强烈，陈列的每一件实物罪证，都是射向中国赫鲁晓夫以及厂内一小撮走资派的子弹，又都是革命职工们斗私批修的好教材。这些实物，使职工们在用伟大的毛泽东思想为武器开展革命大批判时，更加具体地感受到厂内一小撮走资派的反革命罪行，更加具体地联系起这些家伙的黑后台——中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人也更加仇恨，对伟大领袖毛主席更加热爱。工人们说：“不摆不知道，一摆吓一跳。看了现场会上摆出来的这些实物罪证，我们更加认清了中国赫鲁晓夫和他的代理人的反革命嘴脸！”有些工人边看边说：“革命大批判现场会就是好！把中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的反革命罪行活生生地摆了出来，暴露在光天化日之下，我们对中国赫鲁晓夫更加仇恨，批起来更带劲了！”许多革命职工在这个革命大批判现场会上激动地表示，要永远忠于毛主席，念念不忘阶级斗争，把这场无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命进行到底。
    革命大批判现场会，是北京新华印刷厂的革命职工，在驻厂解放军支左人员帮助下，为了进一步搞好革命大批判而开辟的一个新的战场。在这以前，他们遵照伟大领袖毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”和“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判”的教导，结合各项任务，利用各种场合，深入持久地开展革命的大批判。他们大会批，小会批，学习班上批，车间、办公室里批，大字报上批，在有线广播中批，职工批，家属批，人人批判中国赫鲁晓夫，到处都是批判中国赫鲁晓夫的战场。在这种群众性的革命大批判不断深入的情况下，一个多月以前，革命大批判现场会这种新的斗争形式，首先由修制车间的工人们在解放军支左人员帮助下创造出来了。
    修制车间的革命大批判现场会出现后，很快就引起了全厂解放军支左人员和广大革命职工的重视。他们认为，这种斗争形式的最大好处，是能够把中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本厂的代理人的反革命罪行具体地、形象地揭露出来，使人们能够更加认清这些阶级敌人的反动嘴脸，进一步提高阶级斗争、两条路线斗争的觉悟和开展革命大批判的自觉性。他们说，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想、妄图复辟资本主义的反革命罪行，是有大量罪证的；革命大批判现场会，就是把他们的累累罪证集中起来，暴露在光天化日之下的一种好办法。于是，全厂各车间、各科室便根据修制车间的经验，在群众性的革命大批判中，开展了一个大揭中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人反革命修正主义路线的恶果、大摆中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行反革命修正主义路线罪证的活动，很快就筹办起了全厂性的革命大批判现场会，在这个新的阵地上，把革命大批判的烈火烧得更旺。
