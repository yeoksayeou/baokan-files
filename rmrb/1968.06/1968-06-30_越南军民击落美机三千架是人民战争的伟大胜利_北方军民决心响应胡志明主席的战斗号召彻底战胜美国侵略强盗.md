The Vietnamese military and civilians have shot down 3,000 U.S. aircraft, a great victory of people's war. The northern military and civilians are determined to respond to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call to arms and thoroughly defeat the U.S. aggressors.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 28 – Our reporter reports: On June 25, the military and civilians of Quang Binh Province in northern Vietnam shot down another U.S. aggressor aircraft. This is the 3,000th U.S. aggressor aircraft shot down by the northern military and civilians since August 5, 1964. This is a great victory of people's war, a great victory of the iron will of the northern military and civilians to respond to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call to resist America and save the country, determined to defeat the U.S. aggressors.

On August 5, 1964, the U.S. imperialists fabricated the infamous Gulf of Tonkin incident, expanding the war of aggression against South Vietnam to North Vietnam. They attempted to shake the resolve of the people of North and South Vietnam to resist America and save the country, and to obstruct the support of the North Vietnamese people for their brethren in the South, in order to salvage the U.S. imperialists' heavy defeat in South Vietnam. Subsequently, from February 7, 1965, the U.S. imperialists even more frantically bombed North Vietnam. However, the past three years have proven that the bombs of the U.S. imperialists not only failed to intimidate the heroic Vietnamese people, but also shattered their boasted "air superiority" under the iron fists of the heroic Vietnamese people. Among the 3,000 U.S. aggressor aircraft shot down, there are 16 types and 47 models, from B-52 bombers to various jet fighters and bombers, from electronic reconnaissance aircraft to unmanned aircraft. The F-111A aircraft, boasted by the U.S. imperialists as the "most advanced" and "most modern," was shot down by the northern military and civilians just after it entered the battlefield.

The higher the U.S. imperialists escalate their war, the more miserable their defeat, this has become a rule. 1967 was a year when the U.S. aggressors intensified their war escalation, and it was also the year they suffered the most miserable defeat. In this year, the northern military and civilians shot down 1,067 U.S. aggressor aircraft, 294 more than the 773 shot down in 1966. In late October 1967, the U.S. imperialists brazenly and frantically bombed the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, but in five days, 35 aircraft were shot down.

The northern military and civilians shooting down 3,000 U.S. modern aircraft is a great victory of people's war. The northern military and civilians responded to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call to arms, mobilized widely, and bravely fought against the U.S. aggressors. In the battle, not only did the anti-aircraft troops achieve great feats, but the militia self-defense corps also made tremendous contributions. Whether in the factories of the city or in the fields of the countryside, whether at the ferry crossings to the front or on the fishing boats at sea, there are militia self-defense corps members with guns on their backs, ready to fight at any time. They, together with the anti-aircraft troops, formed a dense net, making the U.S. air pirates fall into the vast sea of people's war as soon as they entered northern Vietnam. Among the 3,000 U.S. aircraft, 246 were shot down by male and female militia self-defense corps members. The militia self-defense corps members not only shot down U.S. aggressor aircraft during the day but also at night, blowing the U.S. air pirates to smithereens. In addition to the people's army and militia self-defense corps, even old women and schoolchildren all strive to be "heroes in shooting down U.S. aircraft." They rush to camouflage the positions, help soldiers clean the shells, bring tea to the soldiers, and contribute to shooting down enemy aircraft.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The ultimate source of the great power of war lies in the masses." The millions of revolutionary masses in the north have formed a true iron wall, making the U.S. aggressors suffer heavy losses.

In the past three years, the northern military and civilians have been tested and tempered in the struggle against the U.S. imperialists' war of aggression, becoming even more resolute and brave. They not only bravely fight against the U.S. air pirates and sea pirates but also, in the face of enemy destruction, overcome various difficulties and strive to produce, ensuring the needs of the battle and the people's lives.

During my reporting in Vietnam, whether it was the elderly, youth, people's army soldiers, or militia self-defense corps members, all were full of confidence in defeating the U.S. They recognized from their personal experiences that the U.S. imperialists are paper tigers, and relying on the power of people's war, they can definitely defeat them. An old guerrilla who fought against the French said: "In the past, we defeated the French colonialists. Today's Vietnam is much stronger than then. We have Chairman Mao and 700 million Chinese people supporting us. We will definitely thoroughly defeat U.S. imperialism." Young shock troop member Ame said, "We firmly respond to Uncle Ho's call, fearing neither hardship nor sacrifice, and will fight to the end until the liberation of the South." A squad leader of the people's army artillery unit said: "The U.S. modern aircraft is nothing to be afraid of; we can blow them to smithereens. We will use the strategy of people's war to definitely defeat the U.S. aggressors, liberate the South, and unify the country." The people's army soldiers of northern Vietnam are training hard to kill the enemy.

    越南军民击落美机三千架是人民战争的伟大胜利
    北方军民决心响应胡志明主席的战斗号召彻底战胜美国侵略强盗
    新华社河内二十八日电　本社记者报道：越南北方广平省军民六月二十五日又击落美国强盗飞机一架。这是越南北方军民从一九六四年八月五日以来击落的第三千架美国强盗飞机。这是人民战争的伟大胜利，这是越南北方军民响应胡志明主席抗美救国号召，决心战胜美国强盗的钢铁意志的伟大胜利。
    一九六四年八月五日，美帝国主义侵略者制造了臭名昭著的北部湾事件，把侵略越南南方的战争扩大到越南北方，妄图动摇越南南北两方人民的抗美救国的决心，阻止越南北方人民支援南方骨肉同胞，以挽救美帝在越南南方的惨重失败。随后，美帝国主义从一九六五年二月七日起更加疯狂地狂轰滥炸越南北方。但是，过去三年多的事实证明，美帝国主义的炸弹不仅没有吓倒英雄的越南人民，相反，它吹嘘的所谓
  “空中优势”，在英雄的越南人民的铁拳打击下，象肥皂泡一样地破灭了。在被击落的三千架美国强盗飞机中，从B—52型轰炸机到各种喷气式战斗轰炸机，从电子侦察机到无人驾驶飞机，共包括十六种类型，四十七种式样。被美帝国主义吹嘘为“最新式”、
  “最现代化”的F—111A型飞机，刚刚投入战场，就被越南北方军民击落两架。
    美帝国主义战争“升级”越高，失败就越惨重，这已经成为一种规律。一九六七年是美国侵略者加紧战争“升级”的一年，也是它失败得最惨的一年。在这一年中，越南北方军民击落了美国强盗飞机一千零六十七架，比一九六六年的七百七十三架多二百九十四架。一九六七年十月下旬，美帝国主义悍然疯狂地轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内，但是在五天中就被击落三十五架。
    越南北方军民击落三千架美国现代化飞机，是人民战争的伟大胜利。越南北方军民响应胡志明主席发出的气壮山河的战斗号召，广泛动员起来，英勇地抗击美国侵略者。在战斗中，不仅防空部队立下了显赫战功，民兵自卫队也作出了巨大的贡献。不论是在城市的工厂里，还是在乡村的田野上，不论是在通往前线的渡口旁，还是在海上捕鱼的渔船上，都有背着枪的民兵自卫队员在随时准备战斗，他们同防空部队一起组成了严密的火网，使美国空中强盗一闯进越南北方，就陷入人民战争的汪洋大海。在这三千架美国飞机中，有二百四十六架是被男女民兵自卫队员击落的。民兵自卫队员不仅白天击落了美国强盗飞机，而且在夜间也能把美国空中强盗打得粉身碎骨。除了人民军、民兵自卫队外，老太太、小学生也人人力争作“歼美勇士”，他们争先为阵地做伪装，帮助战士擦炮弹，给战士送茶水，为打落敌机作出了自己的贡献。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“战争的伟力之最深厚的根源，存在于民众之中。”越南北方千百万革命群众形成了一道真正的铜墙铁壁，使美国侵略者碰得头破血流。
    在过去三年多的时间里，越南北方军民在反击美帝国主义侵略战争中经受了考验，锻炼得更加坚强和勇敢。他们不仅勇敢地同美国空中强盗和海盗进行战斗，而且还在遭到敌人破坏的情况下，克服各种困难，努力生产，保证了战斗和人民生活的需要。
    记者在越南采访时接触到的无论是老人、少年，还是人民军战士、民兵自卫队队员，都对战胜美帝充满了信心。他们从亲身的经历中认识到，美帝国主义是纸老虎，依靠人民战争的威力是完全可以把它打败的。一位抗法老游击队员对记者说：“过去我们打败了法国殖民主义者，今天的越南比那时强大得多，我们有毛主席和七亿中国人民支持我们，我们一定能够彻底战胜美帝国主义。”青年突击队员阿梅说，“我们坚决响应胡伯伯的号召，不畏艰苦牺牲，一定要战斗到底，直到解放南方为止。”人民军炮兵部队一位班长说：“美国现代化飞机没有什么了不起，一样被我们打得粉身碎骨。我们运用人民战争的战略，一定能够打败美国侵略者，解放南方，统一祖国。”越南北方人民军战士苦练杀敌本领。
