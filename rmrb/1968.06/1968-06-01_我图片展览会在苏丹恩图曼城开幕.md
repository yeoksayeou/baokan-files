A photo exhibition organized by the Sudan-China Friendship Association opened on June 28 in Entebbe, a city north of Khartoum.

The head of the News and Cultural Bureau of the Sudanese Ministry of Information and Social Affairs, Hassan Zain, presided over the opening ceremony and wrote in the guest book: "I am pleased to preside over the opening of this large photo exhibition, as it clearly reflects the struggles of the Chinese people in building their country.
