The revolutionary committee of the anti-imperialist coal mine No. 3 in Liaoyuan, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, firmly grasps the direction of the struggle, seriously studies the new situation, trends, and characteristics of class struggle, and timely smashes the class enemy's new conspiracies to sabotage the revolutionary committee. Revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses have been further tempered in the storms of class struggle. Revolutionary mass representatives are more trusted by the masses, and the relations between cadres and the masses, as well as between the military and the people, have become closer. The revolutionary committee has been further consolidated and developed, and coal production has continued to rise.

According to a report from our newspaper, the revolutionary committee of the anti-imperialist coal mine No. 3 in Liaoyuan Mining Bureau, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, has paid attention to studying the new situation, trends, and characteristics of class struggle. They have timely exposed the class enemy's new conspiracy of inciting the masses to direct the struggle against the revolutionary mass representatives in the revolutionary committee. They have exposed a small handful of hidden class enemies, thereby further consolidating and developing the revolutionary committee.

Since its establishment, the revolutionary committee of the anti-imperialist coal mine No. 3 has followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forgetting class struggle." They have led all the revolutionary workers in the mine to steadily, accurately, and fiercely strike down the class enemies. The mine's revolution and production have shown a great situation.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The representatives of various exploiting classes, when they are in an unfavorable situation, in order to protect their current existence and future development, often adopt a strategy of attacking to defend themselves." The small handful of class enemies who have infiltrated into the mine are just like this. They sense that their end is coming, so to protect their existence, they have adopted a strategy of attacking to defend themselves. They play tricks, shoot arrows in the dark, deceive the masses, and direct the struggle against the revolutionary mass representatives in the revolutionary committee. They fear that their tricks will be exposed by the masses, so they hide and pretend to be sick, sneaking into some people's homes to spread rumors, inciting the masses to be dissatisfied with the revolutionary mass representatives, and stirring up the masses to direct the struggle against the revolutionary mass representatives in the revolutionary committee. They either use the pretext of opposing "factionalism" to deliberately blur the class nature of factionalism, slandering the revolutionary actions of the revolutionary mass representatives in the revolutionary committee as "bourgeois factionalism"; or they seize on some shortcomings of the revolutionary mass representatives, exaggerating them to the extreme, or fabricating rumors out of nothing; or when the revolutionary masses rise up to clean up the class ranks, they stir up the relationship between the two factions' representatives, and between the revolutionary mass representatives and revolutionary cadres.

After discovering the new trends of class struggle, the revolutionary committee of the mine led all the revolutionary workers in the mine to study Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle, especially repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat under the conditions of socialism to overthrow the bourgeoisie and all other exploiting classes, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and its leadership of the broad revolutionary masses and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Through study, everyone analyzed the essence of the problem from the complicated phenomena. Why, in the current new situation, does a small handful of class enemies want to direct the struggle against the revolutionary mass representatives in the revolutionary committee? After analysis, they realized: First, the revolutionary mass representatives and the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat have established great merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The class enemies want to strike them down and negate them, which is an attempt to negate the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, an important manifestation of the rightist reversal wind. Second, the revolutionary mass representatives are the foundation of the revolutionary committee. They have extensive and close ties with the people. The class enemies' purpose in attacking them is to try to sever the flesh-and-blood connection between the revolutionary committee and the people, weakening the foundation of the newly born revolutionary committee. Third, in the fierce class struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, some comrades among the revolutionary mass representatives, due to lack of experience, inevitably have some shortcomings and mistakes. The class enemies seize on their shortcomings and mistakes, trying to muddy the waters and slip away.

After grasping the essence of the problem, the comrades of the revolutionary committee of the mine firmly stated: No matter how the class enemies change, we will firmly carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The principle of relying on revolutionary mass representatives will never change. We must fully exert the great power of the "three-in-one" revolutionary power, lead the broad revolutionary masses to launch a fierce attack on the class enemies, and thoroughly smash the class enemies' various conspiracies.

The entire membership of the revolutionary committee quickly went deep into the sections, teams, and groups, and together with the broad revolutionary masses, studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle. They extensively discussed the new situation and characteristics of class struggle, the new trends of the class enemies' desperate struggles, and the great significance of consolidating the new-type revolutionary power. They further raised the broad masses' awareness of class struggle and line struggle. They used the "three looks" and comparative analysis methods to tear off the disguises of the counter-revolutionary elements and expose their conspiracies. The "three looks" and comparative analysis methods are: looking at actions to distinguish between the revolutionary masses and the counter-revolutionary two-faced elements who wave the "red flag" to oppose the red flag; looking at motives to distinguish between good people making mistakes and bad people's sabotage and destruction; looking at essence to distinguish between comrades who have temporarily taken the wrong path and those who have consistently held a counter-revolutionary stance. There was a counter-revolutionary element who had infiltrated into the revolutionary mass organization, waving the banner of "rebellion," deceiving the masses, spreading rumors and slanders, attempting to harm the revolutionary mass representatives, and sabotage the newly born revolutionary committee. The broad revolutionary masses, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "being good at distinguishing those who disguise themselves as supporters of the revolution but actually oppose the revolution," fully exposed and analyzed the actions of this counter-revolutionary element, seeing through this fellow's counter-revolutionary essence, and exposing his counter-revolutionary face in broad daylight.

To unite the vast majority of the masses to jointly fight against the enemy, the revolutionary committee strictly distinguished between the two types of contradictions, seriously implemented the Party's policies, and followed the principle of "punishing the past to prevent the future and curing the sickness to save the patient." They conducted painstaking and meticulous ideological and political work on some masses who had not yet seen through the class enemies' new conspiracies. The revolutionary committee fully relied on the revolutionary mass representatives, utilizing their close ties with the masses, to conduct individual heart-to-heart talks with some deceived masses through them. At the same time, they set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes with class struggle education as the content, inviting the masses to participate. In this way, the masses quickly raised their awareness, drew clear class lines, and actively exposed the crimes of the class enemies. There was a worker who initially did not clearly recognize the evil deeds of a counter-revolutionary element who had once been in the same mass organization with him. The members of the revolutionary committee and the comrades of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team visited his home six times, studying Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle with him, helping him see through the class enemies' new conspiracies, and making this worker quickly stand up to expose the crimes of this counter-revolutionary element.

As the masses were mobilized, the class enemies hiding in some dark corners of the mine were exposed, greatly boosting the morale of the revolutionary masses and crushing the arrogance of the class enemies, further purifying the ranks of the working class. Revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses have been further tempered in the storms of class struggle. Revolutionary mass representatives are more trusted by the revolutionary masses, and the relations between cadres and the masses have become closer. The relations between the military and the people have been further strengthened. The revolutionary committee has been consolidated and developed through struggle. The mine's coal production has also risen steadily. Since mid-February, the mine has exceeded the state plan every month, and in May, it completed the entire month's state plan nine days ahead of schedule.

    辽源反帝煤矿三井革委会在解放军帮助下牢牢掌握斗争大方向
    认真研究阶级斗争新形势新动向新特点
    及时粉碎阶级敌人破坏革委会的新阴谋
    革命干部和革命群众在阶级斗争的风浪中进一步受到了锻炼，革命群众代表更加受到群众的信任，干群关系、军民关系更加密切，革命委员会日益巩固发展，煤炭生产不断上升
    本报讯　吉林省辽源矿务局反帝煤矿三井革命委员会，在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，注意研究阶级斗争的新形势、新动向、新特点，及时戳穿阶级敌人挑动群众把斗争矛头指向革委会中革命群众代表的新阴谋，揪出了一小撮暗藏的阶级敌人，从而使革命委员会进一步得到巩固和发展。
    反帝煤矿三井革命委员会成立以来，遵循毛主席关于“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，带领全井革命职工稳、准、狠地打击阶级敌人。全井的革命和生产出现一派大好形势。
    毛主席教导我们：“各种剥削阶级的代表人物，当着他们处在不利情况的时候，为了保护他们现在的生存，以利将来的发展，他们往往采取以攻为守的策略。”混进三井的一小撮阶级敌人就是这样，他们预感到自己的末日来临，为了保护自己的生存，就采取了以攻为守的斗争策略。他们耍阴谋，放暗箭，蒙骗群众，把斗争矛头指向革命委员会中的革命群众代表。他们怕自己的阴谋活动被群众识破，就隐蔽起来，借口有病不上班，偷偷溜进某些群众的家里，散布谣言，挑拨群众对革命群众代表的不满，煽动群众把矛头指向革委会中的革命群众代表。他们或者以反对“派性”为名，故意抹煞派性的阶级性，把革命委员会中的革命群众代表敢于革命的行动，诬蔑为“资产阶级派性”；或者抓住革命群众代表的某些缺点，极力夸大，无限上纲，或者制造谣言，无中生有；当革命群众起来清理阶级队伍的时候，他们又挑拨两派群众代表之间、革命群众代表和革命干部之间的关系。
    三井革命委员会发现了阶级斗争的新动向以后，就领导全井革命职工学习毛主席有关阶级斗争的教导，特别是反复学习了毛主席的最新指示：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”经过学习，大家从错综复杂的现象中，分析问题的本质。为什么在当前的新形势下，一小撮阶级敌人要把斗争矛头指向革委会中的革命群众代表呢？经过分析，他们认识到：一、革命群众代表和广大无产阶级革命派在无产阶级文化大革命中建立了伟大功勋，阶级敌人妄图打击他们，否定他们，就是妄图否定史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，这是右倾翻案妖风的一种重要的表现；二、革命群众代表是革命委员会的基础力量，他们同人民群众有着广泛密切的联系，阶级敌人攻击他们的目的，是妄图割断革委会和人民群众的血肉联系，削弱新生的革命委员会的基础；三、在无产阶级文化大革命的激烈的阶级搏斗中，革命群众代表中的个别同志，由于经验不足，难免有一些缺点和错误，阶级敌人就拚命抓住他们的缺点和错误不放，企图把水搅浑，使自己滑过去。
    三井革委会的同志抓住问题的本质后，坚决表示：不管阶级敌人千变万变，我们坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，坚决依靠革命群众代表的原则永远不变，一定要充分发挥“三结合”革命政权的巨大威力，带领广大革命群众向阶级敌人猛烈进攻，彻底粉碎阶级敌人的各种阴谋。
    革命委员会的全体成员很快深入到段、班、组里，和广大革命群众一起学习毛主席有关阶级斗争的教导，大讲阶级斗争的新形势、新特点，大谈阶级敌人进行垂死挣扎的新动向，大议巩固新型的革命政权的重大意义，进一步提高了广大群众的阶级斗争观念和路线斗争觉悟。他们通过“三看”和对比分析的方法，撕掉了反革命分子的伪装，揭露了反革命分子的阴谋。“三看”和对比分析的方法是：看行动，把无产阶级革命派和打着“红旗”反红旗的反革命两面派区别开来；看动机，把好人做错事和坏人的捣乱破坏区别开来；看本质，把一时走错路的同志和一贯坚持反革命立场的人区别开来。有一个混进革命群众组织里的反革命分子，打着“造反”的旗号，蒙蔽群众，造谣诽谤，企图暗害革命群众代表，以破坏新生的革命委员会。广大革命群众遵照毛主席关于“善于辨别那些伪装拥护革命而实际反对革命的分子”的教导，对这个反革命分子的言行进行了全面揭露和分析，看清了这个家伙的反革命本质，把他的反革命嘴脸暴露在光天化日之下。
    为了团结绝大多数群众共同对敌，革委会严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，认真贯彻执行党的政策，本着“惩前毖后，治病救人”的原则，对一些一时还辨不清阶级敌人新阴谋的群众，进行了艰苦细致的思想政治工作。革委会充分依靠革命群众代表，发挥他们和群众血肉相连、息息相通的作用，通过他们和一些受蒙蔽的群众，进行个别谈心；同时开办以阶级斗争教育为内容的毛泽东思想学习班，吸收群众参加。这样，就使群众迅速提高了觉悟，划清了阶级界限，积极揭发阶级敌人的罪行。有一个工人，开始对曾经和自己是一个群众组织的反革命分子的罪恶认识不清，革委会成员和解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的同志，六次到他家里进行访问，和他一同学习毛主席有关阶级斗争的教导，帮助他识破阶级敌人的新阴谋，使这个工人迅速站起来揭发了这个反革命分子的罪行。
    随着群众的大发动，隐藏在三井一些阴暗角落的阶级敌人被揪了出来，大长了革命群众的志气，大灭了阶级敌人的威风，进一步纯洁了工人阶级的队伍。革命干部和革命群众在阶级斗争的风浪中进一步受到了锻炼，革命群众代表更加受到革命群众的信任，干群关系更加密切，军民关系进一步加强，革命委员会在斗争中得到了巩固和发展。三井的煤炭生产也节节上升，二月中旬以来，月月超额完成国家计划，五月份又提前九天完成了全月的国家计划。
