Patriotic military and civilians of Laos' Luang Prabang Province annihilate over 4,000 enemies in the dry season
All provinces' patriotic military and civilians destroy 101 U.S. planes in dry season battles

	KANGO, June 1 (Xinhua) — According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao radio station: In the 1967-1968 dry season, the patriotic military and civilians of Laos' Luang Prabang Province bravely fought, thwarting the "encroachment" attacks and frenzied "sweeping" operations by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys against the liberated areas, achieving brilliant results.

	According to incomplete statistics, in the first six months of the dry season, the patriotic military and civilians of Luang Prabang Province fought 155 battles, annihilating over 4,600 enemy troops (in the battle of Nam Bao alone, over 3,000 enemies were annihilated), capturing over 1,380 pieces of various weapons, destroying three ammunition depots, blowing up 12 military vehicles, and shooting down or destroying 15 enemy aircraft.

	The broadcast said that the victories achieved by the patriotic military and civilians of Luang Prabang Province are the most outstanding among all provinces. The number of enemies annihilated by this province in the dry season is close to the total number of enemies annihilated nationwide in the previous dry season. Especially during this period, large numbers of enemy regular troops were eliminated, and the strategic military stronghold of Upper Laos—Nam Bao—was recaptured.

	The broadcast pointed out that the patriotic military and civilians of Laos are growing stronger in battle. If U.S. imperialism and its lackeys continue to escalate the aggression war, they will suffer even more severe defeats.

	KANGO, June 1 (Xinhua) — According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao radio station: In the 1967-1968 dry season, the patriotic military and civilians of Laos shot down or destroyed a total of 101 U.S. aircraft.

	The broadcast pointed out that in this dry season, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys intensified their indiscriminate bombing of Laos' liberated areas. The patriotic military and civilians of Laos, filled with intense hatred for the enemy, gave U.S. imperialism and its lackeys the deserved severe punishment.

	KANGO, June 1 (Xinhua) — According to a report by the Pathet Lao News Agency: The people of Laos' liberated areas actively support the front lines with practical actions, making great contributions to the anti-American, national salvation cause.

	To thoroughly defeat the American aggressors and their lackeys, the people of various liberated areas in Laos have enthusiastically sent their children to the front lines to fight the enemy and save the nation. In the first three months of this year, the number of youths enlisting in the military in the Xieng Khouang Province doubled compared to the total number of enlistments in the previous year. In the Xam Neua Province, hundreds of youths joined the People's Liberation Army in the early part of this year alone. In addition, hundreds of young men and women joined the militia and guerrilla forces.

	At the same time, farmers in the liberated areas actively launched production competitions, enthusiastically paid their grain taxes to the people's government, and supported the front lines. According to statistics, the people of Xieng Khouang Province exceeded their original grain tax payment plan by 40% last year and sold over 100 tons of surplus grain to the people's government. The people of Xam Neua Province overcame the severe difficulties caused by natural disasters and successfully completed their grain tax payments. The people of Moung Bun County in Phongsaly Province paid over 20 tons of grain taxes in the past year and the beginning of this year, exceeding their original plan.

	The people of the liberated areas in Xam Neua, Phongsaly, Oudomxay, and Savannakhet provinces also enthusiastically joined the labor transport teams, overcoming various difficulties, and transported large quantities of materials and grain to the front lines, strongly supporting the battles of the People's Liberation Army.

    各省爱国军民在旱季战斗中共击落击毁美机一百零一架
    新华社康开一日电  据巴特寮电台广播：老挝琅勃拉邦省爱国军民在一九六七——一九六八年旱季中，英勇战斗，挫败了美帝国主义及其走狗对解放区的“蚕食”进攻和疯狂“扫荡”，取得了辉煌的战绩。
    据不完全统计，琅勃拉邦省爱国军民在旱季头六个月中，共战斗一百五十五次，歼灭敌人四千六百多名（仅南博一仗，就歼敌三千多人），缴获各种武器一千三百八十多件，捣毁弹药库三座，炸毁军车十二辆，击落击毁敌机十五架。
    广播说，琅勃拉邦省爱国军民所取得的胜利，是全国各省中最突出的胜利。这个省爱国军民在旱季中歼敌的总数，接近于上一个旱季中全国歼敌的总数。特别是在这期间消灭了敌人大量正规部队，并夺回了上寮军事要地——南博。
    广播指出，老挝爱国军民越战越强，如果美帝国主义及其走狗继续扩大侵略战争，必将遭到更加惨重的失败。
    新华社康开一日电据巴特寮电台广播：老挝爱国军民在一九六七——一九六八年旱季里，共击落击毁美机一百零一架。
    广播指出，在这个旱季里，美帝国主义及其走狗加剧了对老挝解放区的狂轰滥炸。老挝爱国军民怀着对敌人的无比愤恨，给了美帝国主义及其走狗以应得的严厉惩罚。
    新华社康开一日电据巴特寮通讯社报道：老挝解放区人民以实际行动积极地支援前线，为抗美救国事业作出巨大贡献。
    为了彻底战胜美国强盗及其走狗，老挝各地解放区人民都纷纷把自己的子弟送上前线杀敌救国。在今年头三个月中，川圹省青年参军的人数比去年全年参军的总数增加两倍。在甘蒙省，仅在今年年初就有成百名青年参加了人民解放军，此外还有数以百计的男女青年参加了民兵游击队。
    与此同时，解放区的农民积极开展生产竞赛，踊跃向人民政权缴纳公粮，支援前线。据统计，川圹省人民去年超额百分之四十完成了原定缴纳公粮的计划，并且多卖给人民政权一百多吨余粮。桑怒省人民克服了天灾等造成的严重困难，也胜利地完成了缴纳公粮的任务。丰沙里省的芒奔县人民在去年和今年年初，缴纳了二十吨以上的公粮，超额完成了原定计划。
    桑怒、丰沙里、乌多姆塞和沙湾拿吉等省解放区的人民，还踊跃地参加了民工运输队，克服各种困难，把大量物资和粮食运往前线，有力地支援人民解放军的战斗。
