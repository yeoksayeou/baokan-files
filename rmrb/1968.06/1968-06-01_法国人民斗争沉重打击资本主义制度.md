The struggle of the French people has dealt a heavy blow to the capitalist system. A two-week general strike has caused capitalists to lose over one hundred billion francs, the position of the franc is precarious, and thousands of banks in Western Europe have refused to accept the franc. The ruling class is preparing to strengthen repression, the French revisionists are terrified and hurriedly plead for "resumption of negotiations"; the American imperialist leader Johnson is deeply afraid that the French people's struggle will trigger a chain reaction, exclaiming that the French situation has "serious implications" for the entire capitalist world.

	New York, June 1 (Xinhua) - Paris: The unprecedented surge of workers' and students' movements in France continues to fiercely impact the reactionary rule of the French monopolistic bourgeoisie with an overwhelming force. French capitalists are hurriedly transferring funds abroad and selling off francs. Banks in various European countries, fearing the devaluation of the franc, have already refused to accept French currency on the 30th. The American imperialist leader Johnson exclaimed that the French situation has "serious implications" for the entire capitalist world.

	The political and economic strike of over ten million French workers has entered its third week as of the 31st. Over the past two weeks, the French ruling class has played various tricks, attempting to soften the workers' resolve and lure them back to work, but to no avail. After the agreement reached between the French government, capitalists, and the revisionist-controlled General Confederation of Labor (CGT) and other national yellow unions for workers to return to work was angrily rejected by the workers, the French ruling class played new tricks, attempting to negotiate separately with unions in various industries and regions to first open some breaches and then gradually divide and weaken the striking workers' fighting forces. A few days ago, the French government loudly proclaimed that it had reached an agreement with the coal miners' union for workers to return to work. However, the broad masses of French coal miners are not fooled and continue to occupy the mines and maintain the strike. The employees of France's largest international airport, Orly, also came out to deny the rumors spread by the authorities about returning to work a few days ago, expressing their determination to continue the struggle.

	Currently, over ten million French workers are still fighting with high morale, and the entire economic life of France remains paralyzed, with French monopolistic capitalists suffering increasingly heavy blows. According to estimates by Western economic experts, the two-week strike alone has caused French capitalists to lose over one hundred billion francs in reduced production value.

	The wave of strikes in France is still expanding, and the ranks of striking workers are continuing to grow. The employees of the "Public Opinion Polling Institute" announced an indefinite strike on the 30th. In the French colony in Latin America, which is listed by the French ruling class as an overseas department, the employees of civil aviation, ports, transportation, postal services, hospitals in Martinique Island also went on strike these two days, supporting the nationwide general strike of French workers.

	The television and radio speech delivered by French President De Gaulle on the 30th not only failed to intimidate the French workers and students but instead aroused the indignation of the masses and was widely condemned. In the working-class districts of Paris and the university district on the left bank of the Seine, the crowd's angry shouts could be heard as De Gaulle's speech was still ongoing. Many workers and students immediately took to the streets, waving red flags, singing the "Internationale," and shouting slogans to express their angry protest against the French ruling class.

	In the Renault car factory on the outskirts of Paris, several thousand workers held a meeting on the morning of the 31st, strongly condemning and protesting against the threats made by the French president to the revolutionary masses. The workers decided to strengthen their struggle and resolutely maintain the strike until victory.

	Students and teachers in Paris have expressed their determination to strengthen unity with the workers, organize, and carry out mass counterattacks against the French ruling class.

	Facing the revolutionary storm of the French people, French capitalists have been dumping their national currency in large quantities in the major foreign exchange markets of the capitalist world, buying Swiss francs, West German marks, and even dollars and pounds. Large numbers of French capitalists, carrying large amounts of their national currency, have been crossing the border into Switzerland to buy Swiss francs.

	Due to the continuous decline in the exchange rate of the French franc, the Swiss International Settlement Bank announced on the 30th that it would stop all activities supporting the French franc. Subsequently, thousands of banks across Western Europe also refused to accept French currency. The French government was in a panic, and on the 31st, it hastily ordered the implementation of exchange controls and restrictions on the outflow of funds. Currently, the position of the French franc is precarious.

	After French President De Gaulle delivered a speech on the evening of the 30th, stating that he would take "other measures" to "maintain the republic," he immediately ordered the military into the Paris region to threaten the revolutionary masses. Gaullist leaders came out to echo, shouting that the "government will not yield to subversion." According to Western news agencies, De Gaulle, the day before delivering this speech, hurriedly flew to Mulhouse in a helicopter to meet with his son-in-law, the commander of the 7th Armored Division, De Boisfeuillade, and other officers, and secretly flew to Baden-Baden in West Germany to discuss measures to deal with the domestic situation with the commander of the French occupation forces in West Germany, Massu.

	In the face of the French government's threat of violence, the French revisionist group was terrified. The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party (referring to the revisionists) immediately issued a statement after De Gaulle's speech, slavishly declaring, "De Gaulle announced his intention to hold new elections. The Communist Party (referring to the revisionists) did not wait for him to deliver his speech and had already demanded it." "It (referring to the revisionists) will participate in this election." The revisionist-controlled General Confederation of Labor also issued a statement, emphasizing its advocacy of "legal struggle" and pleading with the government to "resume negotiations" as soon as possible. The Political Bureau member and General Secretary of the General Confederation of Labor, Seguy, held a press conference on the 31st, assuring the government that the General Confederation of Labor would not obstruct the general election announced by De Gaulle and expressed his willingness to continue negotiations with the government and capitalists on the issue of returning to work. These actions once again clearly exposed the treacherous and scab-like face of the French revisionist group in betraying the interests of the working class.

	The just struggle of French workers and students has received increasingly broad support from people around the world. In the port of Genoa, Italy, dock workers unanimously refused to unload cargo from French port ships to support the struggle of French workers. In Brussels, the capital of Belgium, printing workers refused French printing orders to support the strike of French printing workers. Even in North America, across the ocean, workers and students in the two Canadian cities of Montreal and Vancouver held demonstrations in front of the French consulate, carrying placards in support of the struggle of the French people.

	The revolutionary storm of the French people has shaken the entire capitalist world. The American imperialist leader Johnson is very afraid that the rebellious actions of the French people will trigger a chain reaction in other capitalist countries. He said worriedly at a press conference on the 30th, "The developments there have serious implications not only for France but for the entire world." The ruling classes of the United States and various Western European countries are also concerned that if the franc devalues, it will cause great turmoil in the finance, trade, and economy of the capitalist world, leading to the final collapse of the already shaky monetary system of the capitalist world.

    法国人民斗争沉重打击资本主义制度
    两星期总罢工使资本家损失一百亿法郎以上，法郎地位岌岌可危，西欧数千家银行拒绝接受法郎；统治集团调兵遣将准备加强镇压，法修吓破了胆，急忙哀求“恢复谈判”；美帝头子约翰逊深怕法人民斗争引起连锁反应，惊呼法国局势对整个资本主义世界“都有严重影响”。
    新华社三十一日讯　巴黎消息：法国空前高涨的工人和学生运动，继续以排山倒海之势，猛烈地冲击着法国垄断资产阶级的反动统治。法国资本家纷纷向国外转移资金，抛售法郎。欧洲各国银行担心法郎贬值，三十日已拒绝接受法国货币。美帝国主义头子约翰逊惊呼，法国局势对整个资本主义世界“都有严重影响”。
    法国一千多万工人的政治和经济罢工，到三十一日已进入第三个星期。两个星期以来，法国统治集团玩弄了各种阴谋诡计，力图软化工人的斗志，诱骗工人复工，但一直无法得逞。在法国政府、资本家同法修控制的总工会以及其他全国性的黄色工会达成的复工“协议”被工人愤怒拒绝以后，法国统治集团玩弄新的花招，企图通过同各行业、各地区的工会分别进行谈判的办法，首先打开一些缺口，然后逐步分化瓦解罢工工人的战斗队伍。前几天，法国政府就大肆宣传，说它已经同煤矿工会达成复工“协议”。可是，广大的法国煤矿工人不上这个当，至今继续占领矿井，坚持罢工。法国最大的国际机场——奥利机场的职工前两天也出来辟谣，否认当局散布的关于复工的消息，表示要坚持斗争。
    目前一千多万法国工人仍在斗志昂扬地坚持斗争，整个法国的经济生活继续陷于瘫痪状态，法国垄断资本家受到越来越沉重的打击。按西方经济专家估计，仅就产品减少的价值计算，这两星期的罢工就使法国资本家损失一百亿法郎以上。
    法国罢工的浪潮还在扩展，罢工工人的队伍在继续扩大。法国“民意测验所”的职工三十日也宣布无限期罢工。法国在拉丁美洲的殖民地，被法国统治集团列为法国海外省的马提尼克岛上，民航、港口、交通、邮电、医院的职工这两天也举行罢工，声援法国工人的全国总罢工。
    法国总统戴高乐三十日发表的电视广播演说不仅没有吓倒法国的工人和学生，反而激起群众的义愤，受到普遍的谴责。在巴黎的工人区和塞纳河左岸的大学区，戴高乐的讲话还没完，就响起了群众愤怒的呼声。许多工人与学生当时就走上街头，挥舞着红旗，高唱《国际歌》，高呼口号，向法国统治集团表示愤怒的抗议。
    在巴黎近郊的雷诺汽车工厂，几千工人三十一日清晨举行大会，强烈谴责并抗议法国总统对革命群众进行威胁。工人们决定加强他们的斗争，决心坚持罢工直到胜利。
    巴黎的学生和教师纷纷表示要加强和工人的团结，组织起来，对法国统治集团实行群众性的反击。
    面对着法国人民的革命风暴，法国资本家，连日来在资本主义世界的主要外汇市场大量抛售本国法郎，买进瑞士法郎、西德马克，甚至买进美元和英镑。大批法国资本家携带大量本国货币，纷纷越过国境到瑞士去抢购瑞士法郎。
    由于法国法郎的汇价不断下跌，瑞士国际清算银行三十日宣布停止支持法国法郎的一切活动。接着，整个西欧的数千家银行都拒绝接受法国货币。法国政府手忙脚乱，三十一日慌忙下令说，“由于情况紧急”，马上实行汇兑控制，限制资金外流。目前，法国法郎的地位已岌岌可危。
    法国总统戴高乐三十日晚作了要采取“其他手段”以“维护共和国”的演说后，随即把军队调进巴黎地区，威胁革命群众。戴高乐派的头目纷纷出来帮腔，叫嚷什么“政府不会对颠覆让步”。据西方通讯社报道，戴高乐在发表这次演说前一天，曾乘直升飞机匆匆赶到牟罗兹，同他的女婿第七装甲师师长德布瓦西厄以及其他一些军官会晤，并且秘密地飞到西德的巴登巴登，同法国驻西德占领军司令马絮商谈应付国内局势的措施。
    在法国政府使用暴力的威胁面前，法国修正主义集团吓破了胆。法修政治局在戴高乐演说后马上发表声明，奴颜婢膝地表白说，“戴高乐宣布了他举行新选举的意图。共产党（指法修）没有等到他发表演说，早就要求”了。“它（指法修）将参加这次选举”。法修控制的总工会也发表声明，强调它主张“合法斗争”，哀求政府及早“恢复谈判”。法修的政治局委员兼总工会总书记塞居伊三十一日还举行记者招待会，向政府保证总工会不阻碍戴高乐宣布的大选，并且表示他准备同政府和资本家继续谈判复工问题。这些行径再一次清楚地暴露出法国修正主义集团出卖工人阶级利益的叛徒和工贼的丑恶面目。
    法国工人和学生的正义斗争受到全世界人民越来越广泛的支持。在意大利的热那亚港，码头工人一致拒绝给来自法国港口的商船卸货，以支持法国工人的斗争。比利时首都布鲁塞尔的印刷工人拒绝来自法国的印刷订单，以支持法国印刷工人的罢工。甚至在远隔重洋的北美洲，蒙特利尔和温哥华这两个加拿大城市的工人和学生也举着声援法国人民斗争的标语牌在法国领事馆前举行示威游行。
    法国人民的革命风暴震撼了整个资本主义世界。美帝国主义头子约翰逊十分害怕法国人民的造反行动会在其他资本主义国家中引起连锁反应。他三十日在记者招待会上忧心忡忡地说，“那里的事态发展不仅对法国，而且对全世界都有严重影响。”美国和西欧各国的统治集团还担心法郎一旦贬值会引起资本主义世界金融、贸易和经济的大混乱，使得目前已经摇摇欲坠的资本主义世界的货币体系最后垮台。
