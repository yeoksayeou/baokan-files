Palestinian guerrillas have intensified their attacks on Israeli aggressors in the Gaza Strip, launching more than twenty strikes in the past two weeks, killing and wounding over a hundred enemy soldiers.

	BEIRUT, June 3 (Xinhua) — According to reports from Syrian newspapers, Palestinian guerrillas have recently intensified their attacks on Israeli occupation forces in the Gaza Strip. Despite the curfews and mass arrests imposed by the Israeli occupation authorities, the guerrillas have carried out more than twenty attacks in the past two weeks, killing and wounding 117 enemy soldiers, destroying eleven half-tracked armored vehicles and ten cars.

	Since the Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip, the local Palestinian people have been engaged in various forms of struggle. To suppress the growing resistance, the Israeli authorities, on May 21 and 22, conducted large-scale arrests of Palestinians under the pretext of searching for guerrillas. This atrocity sparked even greater anger among the Palestinian people, leading to a week-long series of massive protests against the Israeli occupation in the Gaza Strip. During this period, the Palestinian guerrillas also intensified their attacks, increasing the number of operations threefold compared to the previous two weeks.

	On the evening of May 21, Palestinian guerrillas detonated a landmine east of the Bureij military camp, destroying an Israeli half-tracked armored vehicle and killing eight occupying soldiers. The same night, they planted landmines in Nahaluz. When Israeli occupying forces arrived in the area, a jeep was immediately blown up, killing and wounding seven soldiers. In the ensuing battle, the guerrillas destroyed another half-tracked armored vehicle, killing ten Israeli soldiers.

	On May 22, the guerrillas planted landmines on a road east of the village of Hunn, destroying an Israeli jeep and a half-tracked armored vehicle, killing eleven soldiers. They also destroyed a military vehicle near Gaza City, killing and wounding nine soldiers.

	On the evening of May 27, the guerrillas sabotaged a road east of the Bureij military camp, destroying an enemy half-tracked patrol vehicle and killing and wounding seven occupying soldiers. The same night, they also destroyed an enemy military vehicle on the road to Gaza City, killing and wounding five soldiers.

	On the morning of June 1, the guerrillas detonated landmines northwest of Miri, destroying two enemy military vehicles. They also detonated landmines near Nimrin, destroying two half-tracked armored vehicles and killing and wounding multiple Israeli soldiers.

    巴勒斯坦游击队加紧打击以色列侵略军
    两周内发动二十多次袭击歼灭敌人一百多名
    新华社大马士革三日电　据叙利亚报纸报道，巴勒斯坦游击队最近加紧在以色列占领的加沙地带打击以色列侵略军。游击队不顾以色列占领当局实行宵禁和大规模的逮捕，在两周内，向加沙地带的以色列侵略军发动了二十多次袭击，打死打伤敌军一百一十七名，击毁半履带式军车十一辆和汽车十辆。
    自从以色列侵占加沙地带以来，当地的巴勒斯坦人民进行了各种方式的斗争。以色列当局为了镇压日益高涨的人民斗争，在五月二十一日和二十二日借口搜查游击队员对当地巴勒斯坦居民进行了大规模的逮捕。这一暴行激起了巴勒斯坦人民的更大愤怒，在加沙地带爆发了持续一个星期的反对以色列占领的强大的游行示威。在这期间，巴勒斯坦游击队也加强了出击，进攻次数比前两周多三倍。
    五月二十一日晚，巴勒斯坦游击队在布雷杰军营以东用地雷炸毁了一辆以色列的半履带式军车，炸死了车上的八名侵略军。同一天晚上，他们又在纳哈卢兹埋设地雷。以色列侵略军赶到这个地区时当即触雷，一辆吉普车被炸毁，炸死炸伤以色列侵略军七名。在接着的战斗中，游击队又击毁了一辆半履带式军车，打死十名以色列侵略军。
    二十二日，游击队在哈农村以东的公路上埋地雷，炸掉以色列侵略军的一辆吉普车和一辆半履带式军车，炸死十一名以色列侵略军。他们还在加沙城附近击毁一辆军车，打死打伤以色列侵略军九名。
    二十七日晚，游击队破坏了布雷杰军营以东的公路，摧毁敌军一辆半履带式巡逻车，打死打伤车上的七名侵略军。同一天晚上，游击队还在通往加沙城的公路上击毁敌军的一辆军车，打死打伤侵略军五名。
    六月一日早晨，游击队在米林西北用地雷炸毁两辆敌军军车。他们还在尼姆林附近用地雷炸毁两辆半履带式军车，炸死炸伤以色列侵略军多名。
