The revolutionary committee of the Ping'an Coal Mine of the Fuxin Mining Bureau in Liaoning Province has conducted thorough investigations and studies, identified the new tactics of class enemies, and struck them steadily, accurately, and resolutely. At the same time, it has closely combined the struggle against enemies with the revolutionary mass criticism, greatly enhancing the class struggle consciousness and line struggle awareness of the broad revolutionary workers, and achieving double victories in revolution and production.

After the establishment of the revolutionary committee of the Ping'an Coal Mine, all the committee members, together with the comrades of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, went down to the mines to intensify class struggle in a point-to-face manner. The sixth mine had poor production and frequent accidents, making it a relatively backward unit. To find out the reasons, the revolutionary committee and the propaganda team comrades, following Chairman Mao's instruction that "class struggle, once grasped, is effective," mobilized the masses to expose the cover of class struggle. It was found that the reason for the poor production was that a few bad elements were secretly spreading rumors and sabotage, inciting workers to anarchism, and secretly setting up faults to disrupt production. After the cover of class struggle was exposed, it gave a great education to the broad revolutionary workers. They realized that class struggle is always present in production struggles. Without grasping class struggle, one would become more and more confused, and production would not improve. After they resolutely struck the class enemies, the revolutionary order was stabilized, faults were reduced, and the workers' revolutionary enthusiasm and production initiative were greatly enhanced. The original coal output of the sixth mine quickly increased.

After achieving success in promoting revolution and production in the sixth mine, the revolutionary committee of the Ping'an Coal Mine and the comrades of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team immediately promoted this experience throughout the mine. The entire mine launched a mass movement to investigate and expose the sabotage activities of class enemies, exposing and uncovering a handful of counter-revolutionary elements who disrupted the promotion of revolution and production.

At the same time, the revolutionary committee of the Ping'an Coal Mine led the broad revolutionary workers to launch a profound wave of revolutionary mass criticism. The revolutionary committee believed that while it is necessary to overthrow and expose the capitalist roaders and repel all attacks by class enemies, it is also essential to carry out revolutionary mass criticism to thoroughly defeat them politically and ideologically, and to completely eliminate their poisonous influence, in order to keep our proletarian dictatorship forever red. The committee members and the comrades of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team went deep into the various mines, sections, shifts, groups, and residential areas of workers' families, repeatedly propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The broad revolutionary workers and their families recognized the current class struggle situation and decided to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and actively participate in the struggle of revolutionary mass criticism.

With Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, the broad revolutionary workers and their families fiercely criticized the revisionist trash of "class struggle extinction," "material incentives," "bonus as the commander," and "emphasizing business" propagated by China's Khrushchev and his agents in this region, thus making the revolutionary mass criticism in the entire mine increasingly profound.

Through launching a fierce attack on class enemies and carrying out profound revolutionary mass criticism, people's spiritual outlook greatly changed. The broad revolutionary workers' production initiative was fully unleashed. They adhered to the eight-hour work system, modelly observed socialist labor discipline, and launched a competition to produce more and better coal for the revolution. From the beginning of the year to mid-May, the entire mine produced an additional 7,300 tons of coal for the state.

    大抓阶级斗争稳准狠地打击阶级敌人
    阜新矿务局平安煤矿革委会紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，把对敌斗争和革命大批判紧密结合，取得革命和生产双胜利
    本报讯　辽宁省阜新矿务局平安煤矿革命委员会深入调查研究，弄清阶级敌人的新动向，稳、准、狠地打击阶级敌人，同时把对敌斗争和革命大批判紧密结合起来，大大增强了广大革命职工的阶级斗争观念和路线斗争觉悟，取得了革命和生产双胜利。
    平安煤矿革命委员会成立以后，全体委员便和解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的同志纷纷下到矿井，以点带面地狠抓阶级斗争。六井生产不好，事故又多，是一个比较后进的单位。为了查清原因，革委会和宣传队的同志来到六井后，遵照毛主席“阶级斗争，一抓就灵”的教导，发动群众大揭阶级斗争的盖子。发现生产搞不上去的原因，原来是几个坏分子在暗地里煽阴风，点鬼火，煽动工人闹无政府主义，并且暗地设置故障，破坏生产。阶级斗争的盖子揭开后，给广大革命职工以极大的教育。他们认识到，在生产斗争中也始终贯穿着阶级斗争。不抓阶级斗争就会越来越糊涂，生产不可能上去。他们稳、准、狠地打击了阶级敌人以后，革命秩序稳定了，故障减少了，工人的革命热情和生产积极性大大提高，六井的原煤产量迅速上升。
    平安煤矿革命委员会和解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的同志，在六井取得了抓革命促生产的成功经验以后，立即在全矿推广。全矿展开了清查阶级敌人破坏活动的群众运动，揭发和揪出了一小撮破坏抓革命促生产的反革命分子。
    同时，平安煤矿革委会带领广大革命职工，掀起了深入的革命大批判高潮。革委会认为：斗倒斗臭走资派，打退一切阶级敌人的进攻，是当前斗争的主要任务，但是，还必须开展革命大批判，在政治上思想上把他们彻底打倒，彻底肃清他们的流毒，才能使我们无产阶级政权永远保持鲜红的颜色。革委会成员和解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的同志深入到各井、段、班、组和家属住宅，反复宣传毛主席的最新指示。广大革命职工和家属认清了当前的阶级斗争形势，决心紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，积极投入革命大批判的斗争。
    广大革命职工和家属，以毛泽东思想为武器，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本地区的代理人的“阶级斗争熄灭”论、“物质刺激”、“奖金挂帅”、“突出业务”等修正主义黑货，从而使革命的大批判在全矿越搞越深入。
    通过向阶级敌人展开猛烈进攻和深入地开展革命大批判，人们精神面貌大大改变。广大革命职工的生产积极性充分发挥出来了。他们坚持八小时工作制，模范地遵守社会主义劳动纪律，掀起了为革命多出煤出好煤的竞赛运动。从年初到五月中旬，全矿为国家多出煤炭七千三百多吨。
