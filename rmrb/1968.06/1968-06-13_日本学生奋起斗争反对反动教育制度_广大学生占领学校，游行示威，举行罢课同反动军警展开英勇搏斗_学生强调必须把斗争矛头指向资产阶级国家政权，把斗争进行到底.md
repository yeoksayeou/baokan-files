	Japanese students are currently engaged in a struggle against the reactionary educational system of the Sato government.

	Since late May, students at Nihon University in Tokyo have been fighting against the corrupt administrative system and the fascist rule imposed on students. On June 11th and 12th, students from the Law and Economics departments successively occupied their respective buildings and held indefinite class boycotts, demanding democratization of the educational system.

	On the 11th, 5,000 students from Nihon University gathered in front of the Economics building. At this time, the reactionary school authorities mobilized a group of thugs to brutally attack the students. They wielded sticks and swords to beat the students and threw desks, chairs, and various steel furniture from the Economics building to attack the students, injuring over 100 students. The brave students retaliated with stones and flagpoles. Soon, the reactionary Sato government dispatched more than 1,000 police to suppress the students. The students continued their struggle until late at night. Meanwhile, Law students occupied the Law building, set up barricades at the entrance, and declared a class boycott.

	On the afternoon of the 12th, more than 3,000 students from Nihon University held another gathering in the campus. During the meeting, students unanimously expressed their determination to fight to the end. They said that the struggle must be directed against the reactionary bourgeois state power. After the meeting, the students held a massive demonstration and drove out the thugs from the Economics building, occupying the building. They set up barricades with desks and chairs and held a class boycott inside the building.

	Students plastered numerous leaflets and slogans on the walls of the Economics and Law buildings. Flags of struggle fluttered from the windows of these two buildings.

	Students from the Medical and Dental Schools in Tokyo, as well as the Medical Department of Tokyo University, also held class boycotts to oppose the reactionary internship doctor system implemented by the Sato government. This struggle has lasted for more than 120 days.

    新华社十二日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本大学生正在展开斗争，反对佐藤政府的反动教育制度。
    东京日本大学的学生自五月底以来一直在进行斗争，反对腐朽的管理制度和对学生实行法西斯统治。六月十一日和十二日，法律系和经济系的学生先后占领了本系的大楼，举行不定期的罢课，要求教育制度民主化。
    十一日，日本大学的五千名学生在经济系教学楼前集会。这时，学校反动当局调动一批暴徒野蛮地袭击学生。他们挥舞棍棒和刀剑殴打学生，并从经济系教学楼向下扔桌椅和各种钢制家具攻击学生，使一百多名学生受伤。英勇的学生用石块和旗竿作武器，坚决回击。不久，佐藤反动政府又派来一千多名警察镇压学生。学生继续坚持斗争，直到深夜。另一方面，法律系的学生占领了法律系教学楼，在楼门口设置了路障，并宣布罢课。
    十二日下午，日本大学的三千多名学生再一次在校园里举行集会。在会上讲话的学生一致表示要把斗争进行到底。他们说，必须把斗争的矛头指向反动的资产阶级国家政权。会后，学生们举行了声势浩大的示威游行，并从经济系的教学楼赶走了暴徒，占领了这座楼。他们用桌椅设置了路障，固守在楼里举行罢课。
    学生们在经济系和法律系的教学楼的墙壁上，贴满了无数传单和标语。这两座教学楼的窗户上飘扬着斗争的旗帜。
    东京医科和牙科学院以及东京大学医疗系的学生也举行罢课，反对佐藤政府制订的反动的实习医生制度。这场斗争已经坚持了一百二十多天。
