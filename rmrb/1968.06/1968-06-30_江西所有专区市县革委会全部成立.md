In the triumphant song of seizing comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, revolutionary old base area Jiangxi Province has brought forth inspiring news: all eight prefectures (cities) and 89 counties and county-level regions in the province have established revolutionary committees. In grassroots units, more than 98 percent of rural people's communes and the vast majority of factories, mines, enterprises, shops, schools, and government agencies have established revolutionary three-in-one temporary power organs. This is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, a fruitful result of the heroic sons and daughters of Jinggangshan's struggle against a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, and a great achievement of the People's Liberation Army in the "three supports, two militaries" work. The revolutionary committees at all levels in the province are leading the heroic sons and daughters of Jinggangshan to press on and seize comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The basic experience of the revolutionary committees is threefold: one is the representative of revolutionary cadres, one is the representative of the army, and one is the representative of revolutionary masses, thus achieving the three-in-one combination of the revolution. The revolutionary committee should implement unified leadership, break up the overlapping administrative organs, streamline the bureaucracy, and organize a revolutionary leadership corps that is closely linked with the masses." After being born in the fierce class struggle, the revolutionary committees at all levels in Jiangxi Province have followed Chairman Mao's latest instructions, inherited and carried forward the thorough revolutionary spirit that the great leader Chairman Mao personally established in Jinggangshan, the glorious tradition of hard struggle, and the fine style of close ties with the masses. They have continuously strengthened the construction of the revolutionary committees, making the newly born revolutionary committees at all levels play a powerful role in organizing the masses to carry out the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, leading the revolutionary masses to launch a fierce attack on the class enemies, and promoting production while carrying out the revolution. They have won the enthusiastic love, firm support, and active support of the broad revolutionary masses.

Inheriting the glorious revolutionary tradition personally established by Chairman Mao, building the revolutionary committees into battle command posts that are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao

Jiangxi is the first revolutionary old base area in China personally established by Chairman Mao. The revolutionary fighting spirit ignited by Chairman Mao in Jiangxi has spread throughout China and illuminated the path of revolutionary struggle for the people of the world. The members of the revolutionary committees at all levels in Jiangxi Province all feel a great honor to be able to participate in the work of the revolutionary committees in this revolutionary old base area. Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice in Jiangxi is the most brilliant model for the construction of the revolutionary committees at all levels in the province; the glorious revolutionary tradition personally established by Chairman Mao in Jiangxi is the best example for the newly born revolutionary committees to learn from. Therefore, as soon as the revolutionary committees at all levels were established, they vigorously carried out revolutionary tradition education and strove to build the revolutionary committees into battle command posts that are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and that are highly combatant and highly revolutionary.

Since the establishment of the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee, revolutionary tradition education has been widely carried out among the revolutionary committees at all levels and the broad masses of the people. The Provincial Revolutionary Committee held a study class on Mao Zedong Thought in Jinggangshan, organizing members of the revolutionary committees at all levels in the province to take turns going up the mountain to study. They combined the great revolutionary practice of the great leader Chairman Mao, the glorious revolutionary tradition of Jinggangshan, and Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions on the construction of revolutionary committees, studied them seriously, and implemented them repeatedly, making the revolutionary committees at all levels quickly establish a new revolutionary style.

In the revolutionary cradle of Jinggangshan, the revolutionary committees at all levels in the Jinggangshan Prefecture all vigorously carried out the education of "carrying forward the revolutionary tradition and striving for greater glory." Whether it is the prefecture, county, or factory, or rural people's commune revolutionary committees, the first meeting after their establishment was to study Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Struggle in Jinggangshan" and "The Spark Will Become a Flame," and the brilliant "Three Constantly Read Articles." The prefecture and many counties' revolutionary committees also organized members of the revolutionary committees at all levels and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations to go to Jinggangshan to study the glorious history of revolutionary struggle and invited old Red Army soldiers to introduce the glorious revolutionary tradition of Jinggangshan. This made the construction of the newly born revolutionary committees, from the very beginning, follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao and advance in big strides on the road of revolutionization.

Carrying forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of Jinggangshan, leading the revolutionary masses to attack the class enemies without stopping

After the establishment of the revolutionary committees at all levels in Jiangxi Province, following Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle," they carried forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat that Chairman Mao personally led the people of Jinggangshan to fight against the landlords and distribute the land, and resolutely struggle against the enemies. They vigorously carried out class struggle, mobilized the masses to carry out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, and led the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses in the province to launch a fierce attack on the class enemies without stopping.

After the establishment of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee, it took the vigorous grasp of class struggle as an unremitting direction, fully mobilized and organized the masses, and launched an in-depth and sustained exposure, criticism, and struggle against China's Khrushchev and his agents in Jiangxi, making a handful of class enemies completely isolated. In the fierce class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, the main leading members of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee went deep into the countryside, factories, mines, and schools to investigate the new trends and situations of class struggle, mobilized the masses to dig out a batch of hidden class enemies, and achieved great victories. The revolutionary committees at all levels in the old revolutionary base area of Gan Nan carried forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the people in the old base area who struggled heroically under Chairman Mao's leadership, and the members of the revolutionary committees all stood on the front line of class struggle, serving both as commanders and fighters. They led the broad revolutionary masses to resolutely fight against the enemies, carried out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, resolutely opposed right opportunism, right splitism, and right capitulationism, smashed the rightist reversal wind, and dug out one by one the hidden traitors, spies, and other counter-revolutionaries, greatly consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. In the fierce class struggle, the newly born revolutionary committees were tempered and gradually built into strong revolutionary battle command posts.

Upholding the Party's style of close ties with the masses, forever rooting in the masses

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The most fundamental aspect of the reform of state organs is to link with the masses." The revolutionary committees at all levels in Jiangxi Province follow Chairman Mao's teachings, carry forward the fine style of close ties with the masses that Chairman Mao has always advocated, often go deep into the masses, and become students of the masses, "serving both as officials and as ordinary people," making the newly born revolutionary committees forever root in the masses.

After the establishment of the Xingguo County Revolutionary Committee, it organized all members to walk to the Changgang Production Brigade, invited revolutionary old comrades to introduce Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice in Changgang Township at that time, and the revolutionary spirit of the Changgang Township cadres who created first-class work under Chairman Mao's direct leadership at that time. The members of the Revolutionary Committee and the poor and lower-middle peasants worked together in the fields where Chairman Mao had labored. Seeing that a small path by the village was damaged by a flood, following Chairman Mao's teaching of caring for the people's livelihood, they immediately used their rest time to repair the road. The poor and lower-middle peasants in the Changgang Production Brigade saw that the leading members of the County Revolutionary Committee cared so much for the people and enthusiastically praised them as good cadres of Chairman Mao and good servants of the people. The Anshan Coal Mine Revolutionary Committee carried forward the glorious revolutionary tradition of Red Anshan, and the members of the Revolutionary Committee went out of the office, went deep into the mines and grassroots, and blended with the masses, establishing a close and affectionate relationship with the workers. The leading members of the Revolutionary Committee often went down to the mines to work, consulted with the masses on matters, listened to the masses' opinions, and humbly accepted the masses' supervision, making the new leading corps closely linked with the masses and maintaining vigorous combat effectiveness. The members of the Lianhua County Revolutionary Committee under Jinggangshan broke down the overlapping administrative organs, implemented the principle of streamlining the bureaucracy, and implemented unified leadership, making the Revolutionary Committee closely linked with the masses, representing the interests of the masses at all times, and serving the people wholeheartedly.

Inheriting the glorious tradition of hard struggle in Jinggangshan, forever preserving the revolutionary youth

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and more arduous. This must be made clear to the Party now, and comrades must continue to maintain the style of modesty, prudence, no arrogance, and no impetuosity, and comrades must continue to maintain the style of hard struggle." The revolutionary committees at all levels in Jiangxi Province remember Chairman Mao's great teaching, carry forward the glorious revolutionary tradition of hard struggle personally established by Chairman Mao, and make the newly born revolutionary committees forever preserve the revolutionary youth.

As soon as the Jinggangshan Revolutionary Committee was established, all members of the Revolutionary Committee first invited old Red Army soldiers to report on the revolutionary struggle history of Chairman Mao leading the people of Jinggangshan to struggle hard, and everyone ate the revolutionary traditional meal of red rice and pumpkin that Chairman Mao had eaten. The members of the Revolutionary Committee solemnly declared in front of the great leader Chairman Mao's portrait that they would definitely pass on the revolutionary tradition from generation to generation and carry it forward forever. The new leading cadres of the Changgang People's Commune in Xingguo County inherited the hardworking style of the cadres in the old revolutionary base area who brought their own food and wore straw shoes to do the revolution, insisted on not leaving labor, worked hard, had simple habits, carefully calculated everything, and served the poor and lower-middle peasants wholeheartedly, making the newly born revolutionary committees maintain a bright red revolutionary color. The members of the Rujin County Revolutionary Committee often carried Chairman Mao's works, carried backpacks, braved hardships, went deep into factories and rural areas, especially into some remote mountain areas to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and worked barefoot in the fields with the poor and lower-middle peasants, eating, living, studying, and working together, living simply and frugally, and were praised by the masses.

    战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利  毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利
    江西所有专区市县革委会全部成立
    各级革委会遵循毛主席关于革命委员会的指示，努力建设成为朝气蓬勃的革命战斗指挥部。各级革委会正在率领广大革命群众乘胜前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利
    新华社南昌二十九日电　在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，革命老根据地江西省传来了振奋人心的喜讯：全省八个专区（市）、八十九个县和相当于县的地区，全部成立了革命委员会。在基层单位中，百分之九十八以上的农村人民公社以及绝大部分的工矿、企业、商店、学校、机关，也都建立了革命三结合的临时权力机构。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，是英雄的井冈山儿女向党内一小撮走资派进行夺权斗争的丰硕成果，是人民解放军在“三支”“两军”工作中建立的丰功伟绩。全省各级革命委员会正率领着英雄的井冈山儿女乘胜前进，去夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    伟大领袖毛主席指出：“革命委员会的基本经验有三条：一条是有革命干部的代表，一条是有军队的代表，一条是有革命群众的代表，实现了革命的三结合。革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”江西省各级革命委员会在激烈的阶级斗争中胜利诞生后，遵循毛主席这一最新指示，继承和发扬伟大领袖毛主席当年亲自树立的井冈山彻底革命精神，艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，密切联系群众的优良作风，不断加强革命委员会的建设，使新生的各级革命委员会在组织广大群众开展活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动中，在率领革命群众向阶级敌人展开猛烈进攻中，在抓革命，促生产的斗争中，越来越发挥出强大的威力，得到广大革命群众的热情爱戴，坚决拥护，积极支持。
    继承毛主席亲手树立的光荣革命传统，把革命委员会建设成为无限忠于毛主席的革命战斗指挥部
    江西是毛主席亲自创建的我国第一个革命老根据地。伟大领袖毛主席当年点燃的井冈山革命斗争的烈火，燃遍了全中国，照亮了世界人民革命斗争的道路。江西省各级革命委员会的成员，都为自己能参加这个革命老根据地的革命委员会的工作，而感到无上的光荣。毛主席当年在江西的伟大革命实践，就是全省各级革命委员会建设的最光辉的典范；毛主席当年在江西亲自树立的光荣革命传统，就是新生的革命委员会学习的最好的样板。因此，各级革命委员会一诞生，就狠抓革命传统教育，努力把革命委员会建设成为无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的非常战斗化、非常革命化的战斗指挥部。
    江西省革命委员会成立以来，在各级革命委员会和广大人民群众中，广泛开展了革命传统教育。省革命委员会在井冈山开办了毛泽东思想学习班，组织全省各级革命委员会成员轮流上山学习。他们把伟大领袖毛主席的伟大革命实践、井冈山的光荣革命传统和毛主席关于革命委员会建设的一系列最新指示结合起来，认真学习，反复落实，使各级革命委员会迅速建立起崭新的革命作风。
    在革命摇篮井冈山所在地的井冈山专区，各级革命委员会都大抓了“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的教育。无论是专区、县或工厂、农村人民公社的革命委员会，成立后的第一次会议，就是学习毛主席的光辉著作《井冈山的斗争》、《星星之火，可以燎原》和光辉的“老三篇”。专区和许多县的革命委员会，还组织各级革命委员会成员以及革命群众组织的负责人，上井冈山学习光荣的革命斗争历史，请老红军介绍井冈山的光荣革命传统。这就使新生的革命委员会的建设，从一开始就沿着毛主席指引的方向，在革命化的道路上大踏步前进。
    发扬井冈山的彻底革命精神，率领革命群众不停顿地向阶级敌人进攻
    江西省各级革命委员会成立后，遵照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，发扬毛主席当年亲自领导井冈山人民打土豪分田地，向敌人进行坚决斗争的无产阶级彻底革命精神，狠抓阶级斗争，发动群众深入持久地开展革命的大批判，率领全省无产阶级和广大革命群众，主动地、不停顿地向阶级敌人展开猛烈进攻。
    省革命委员会成立后，把狠抓阶级斗争作为念念不忘的大方向，充分发动群众、组织群众，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在江西的代理人展开了深入持久的大揭发、大批判、大斗争，使一小撮阶级敌人完全陷于孤立。在激烈的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争中，省革命委员会的主要领导成员深入农村、工厂、矿山和学校，调查阶级斗争的新动向、新情况，发动群众挖出了一批暗藏的阶级敌人，取得了巨大的胜利。赣南革命老根据地的各级革命委员会，发扬老根据地人民当年在毛主席领导下英勇斗争的彻底革命精神，革命委员会成员都站到阶级斗争的第一线，既当指挥员，又当战斗员。他们带领广大革命群众坚决同敌人作斗争，深入持久地展开了革命大批判，坚决反对右倾机会主义、右倾分裂主义、右倾投降主义，粉碎右倾翻案妖风，把隐藏的一小撮叛徒、特务和其他反革命分子一个个挖出来，大大巩固了无产阶级专政。在激烈的阶级斗争中，新生的革命委员会得到锻炼，逐渐建设成为坚强的革命战斗指挥部。
    坚持党的密切联系群众的作风，永远扎根于群众之中
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”江西省各级革命委员会遵照毛主席的教导，发扬毛主席一贯倡导的党的密切联系群众的优良作风，经常深入群众，做群众的小学生，“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”，使新生的革命委员会永远扎根于群众之中。
    兴国县革命委员会成立后，就组织全体成员步行来到长冈大队，请革命老同志介绍毛主席当年在长冈乡的伟大革命实践，以及当时长冈乡工作人员在毛主席直接领导下创造出第一等工作的革命精神。革命委员会成员和贫下中农一起，到当年毛主席劳动过的田里参加生产劳动。大家看到村边一条小路被洪水冲坏，遵照毛主席要关心群众生活的教导，立即利用休息时间把路修好。长冈大队的贫下中农看到县革命委员会的领导成员这样关心群众，热烈称赞他们是毛主席的好干部，人民的好勤务员。安源煤矿革命委员会发扬红色安源的光荣革命传统，革命委员会成员走出办公室，深入矿井、基层，和群众打成一片，和工人建立了鱼水般的亲密关系。革委会领导成员经常下井劳动，遇事和群众商量，倾听群众的意见，虚心接受群众的监督，使新的领导班子和群众血肉相联，保持着旺盛的战斗力。井冈山下莲花县的革委会成员，打破了重叠的行政机构，贯彻精兵简政的原则，实行一元化领导，使革命委员会密切了同群众的联系，时刻代表群众的利益，全心全意为人民服务。
    接过井冈山艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，永葆革命的青春
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。这一点现在就必须向党内讲明白，务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。”江西省各级革命委员会牢记毛主席这一伟大教导，发扬毛主席亲自树立的艰苦奋斗的光荣革命传统，使新生的革命委员会永葆革命的青春。
    井冈山革命委员会一成立，革委会全体成员首先请老红军报告了毛主席当年领导井冈山人民艰苦奋斗的革命斗争史，大家一起吃了毛主席当年吃过的红米、南瓜做的革命传统饭。革委会成员在伟大领袖毛主席像前坚决表示，一定把革命的传统代代相传，永远发扬光大。兴国县长冈公社新的领导班子成员，继承革命老根据地干部那种自带干粮、穿着草鞋干革命的艰苦作风，坚持不脱离劳动，工作刻苦，作风朴素，事事精打细算，全心全意为贫下中农服务，使新生的革命委员会保持着鲜红的革命颜色。瑞金县革命委员会成员经常身带毛主席著作，背着背包，不畏艰苦，深入工厂、农村，特别是深入到一些偏僻山区去宣传毛泽东思想，落实毛主席的最新指示，并同贫下中农一起，打着赤脚，下田参加集体生产劳动，做到和贫下中农同吃、同住、同学习、同劳动，艰苦朴素，受到群众的赞扬。
