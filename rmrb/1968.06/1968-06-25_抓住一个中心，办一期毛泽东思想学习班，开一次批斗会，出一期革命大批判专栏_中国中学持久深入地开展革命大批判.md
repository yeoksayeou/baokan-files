The revolutionary teachers and students of Zhongguo Middle School in Shanghai have launched a vigorous offensive against class enemies by using the method of "focusing on one central issue, holding a study session on Mao Zedong Thought, conducting a struggle session, and publishing a revolutionary criticism column." This approach has ensured that the revolutionary criticism campaign is sustained and deepened.

Since the establishment of the school's revolutionary committee in February this year, the school has held thirteen study sessions on Mao Zedong Thought, each with excellent results. The sessions have focused on studying Chairman Mao's proletarian party-building thoughts, criticizing the revisionist party-building line of the Chinese Khrushchev, as well as cleaning up class ranks, repelling the rightist reversal wind, opposing bourgeois factionalism, and criticizing the revisionist educational line.

The revolutionary young fighters of Class 13, Grade 9, focused on criticizing the fallacy of "intellectual education first" in the revisionist educational line. They studied Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" and the proletarian educational policy, and struggled against and criticized the school's capitalist roaders who promoted the revisionist goods of "four realizations": "realizing the gains of down-to-the-countryside labor in mid-term exams," "realizing class education in good academic performance," "caring for workers and peasants' children by improving their grades," and "realizing great aspirations in final exams." They linked these slogans with the "intellectual education first" propaganda spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and exposed the evil conspiracy of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents to lead young people down the capitalist road of "red and expert."

After struggling against the Chinese Khrushchev and the school's capitalist roaders, the young fighters in this class also conducted self-criticism in conjunction with the criticism of revisionism to cleanse their minds of revisionist poison. Finally, they compiled their study notes and the results of their struggle against the capitalist roaders into articles and published a revolutionary criticism column to exchange ideas and consolidate their achievements. The revolutionary young fighters said that using this method to conduct revolutionary criticism can more effectively and continuously raise their class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness.

    抓住一个中心，办一期毛泽东思想学习班，开一次批斗会，出一期革命大批判专栏
    中国中学持久深入地开展革命大批判
    上海市中国中学革命师生，在主动向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻中，运用“抓住一个中心，办一期毛泽东思想学习班，开一次批斗会，出一期革命大批判专栏”的办法，把革命大批判持久而深入地开展起来。
    这个学校在今年二月成立校革命委员会以来，先后以学习毛主席的无产阶级建党思想，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线，以及清理阶级队伍、击退右倾翻案妖风、反对资产阶级派性、批判修正主义教育路线等为中心，办了十三期毛泽东思想学习班，每期效果都很好。他们抓住一个中心问题办起学习班以后，就结合学习内容，把学校里的走资派、国民党反动派的残渣余孽揪出来进行批斗。然后，再组织大家写文章，出大批判专栏。这样做的结果，有效地提高了广大革命师生的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟。
    初三（十三）班革命小将，以批判修正主义教育路线中的“智育第一”的谬论为中心，办了一期学习班。他们学习了毛主席的“五·七”指示和无产阶级教育方针，斗批了学校走资派提出的修正主义黑货“四落实”：“下乡劳动的收获落实到期中考试”，“阶级教育落实到学习好”，“关心工农学生落实到提高成绩”，“树立雄心壮志要落实到期终考试”。大家把这些黑话同中国赫鲁晓夫散布的“智育第一”联系起来进行批判，狠狠地揭露了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人妄图引导青少年走白专道路的罪恶阴谋。
    这个班级的小将们在批斗了中国赫鲁晓夫以及校内走资派以后，还在班上结合批修进行斗私，肃清自己头脑中的修正主义流毒。最后，他们把学习心得和批斗走资派的收获，写成文章，出了一期大批判专栏，交流思想，巩固成绩。革命小将们说，采用这种办法进行革命大批判，可以更有效地不断提高自己的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。
