Anshan Iron and Steel Works Seamless Steel Pipe Factory's revolutionary and productive efforts have yielded a double harvest. According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Anshan on the 10th, the revolutionary workers of the entire factory have been vigorously promoting the revolution and production, creating a new atmosphere of dual success in both areas. They have been deeply and persistently engaged in revolutionary criticism, continuously eliminating the revisionist poison spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Anshan and the factory. They have also exposed and rooted out traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries who have infiltrated the ranks of the working class, greatly boosting the morale of the working class and crushing the arrogance of the class enemies. This has, in turn, promoted a significant development in production. Since the beginning of this year, the factory has consistently exceeded its production targets month after month and has successfully developed over thirty new products. Since April, the revolutionary workers of the entire factory have been studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought extensively in various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, further igniting their revolutionary enthusiasm and setting new records in production.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat under the conditions of socialism to oppose the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and the revolutionary people under its leadership and the reactionary Kuomintang. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." After this latest directive from Chairman Mao was issued, the revolutionary workers of the entire factory immediately launched a campaign of extensive study, discussion, and propaganda. The revolutionary workers have been vigorously waging class struggle and have been doing everything possible to improve production. They say, we must channel the revolutionary enthusiasm ignited during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into production, to produce more and better products for the country. With this practical action, we will foil the plot of a handful of class enemies who attempt to sabotage production and add luster to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! They also follow Chairman Mao's great directive of "being prepared for war, prepared for famine, and serving the people," launching a comprehensive offensive against technical difficulties, thereby producing a large number of cutting-edge products that are particularly large, small, thick, or thin.

    鞍钢无缝钢管厂革命生产双丰收
    据新华社鞍山十日电　鞍钢无缝钢管厂广大革命职工狠抓革命，猛促生产，全厂出现了革命和生产双丰收的新气象。他们深入持久地开展革命大批判，不断地清除中国赫鲁晓夫及其在鞍钢和本厂的代理人所散布的修正主义流毒，并且把混进工人阶级队伍的叛徒、特务和反革命分子一个个地挖出来，大长了工人阶级的志气，大灭了阶级敌人的威风，从而促进了生产的大发展。今年以来，这个厂月月超额完成生产任务，还试制成功三十多项新产品。四月份以来，全厂广大革命职工在各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班里大学大用毛泽东思想，进一步激发了革命干劲，在生产方面创造了许多新纪录。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”毛主席的这一最新指示发表后，全厂革命职工立即掀起了大学习、大讨论、大宣传的热潮。广大革命职工狠抓阶级斗争，并且千方百计搞好生产。他们说，我们一定要把在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的革命干劲用到生产上去，为国家增产更多更好的产品，用这个实际行动来回击一小撮阶级敌人妄图破坏生产的阴谋，为无产阶级文化大革命增光！他们还遵循毛主席的“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大教导，向技术难关展开了全面的攻坚战，从而使一些特大、特小、特厚、特薄的尖端产品大量地生产出来。
