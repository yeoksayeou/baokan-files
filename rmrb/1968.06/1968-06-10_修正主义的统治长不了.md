The storm of revolutionary mass struggles that has risen in capitalist countries such as France and the United States has now spread to countries ruled by modern revisionist cliques. The flames of the people's anger have already ignited under the feet of a small clique of bourgeois privileged classes that have usurped the power of socialist countries.

In recent days, a large-scale student movement has erupted in Yugoslavia to resist the reactionary rule of the Tito clique. Students in Belgrade and other places have held angry demonstrations and marches, occupied schools, and engaged in fierce struggles with reactionary police. The wave of people's struggles has powerfully impacted the revisionist rule of the Tito clique, making both the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists tremble with fear. The Associated Press exclaimed that this is an "unprecedented" event "since the end of the Second World War," reflecting the fear of U.S. imperialism.

The Tito clique is the vanguard of the U.S. imperialists' policy of "peaceful evolution." Yugoslavia has been a showcase of "socialism" carefully cultivated by U.S. imperialism for many years. Now, this showcase has been further shattered by the outbreak of the student movement in Yugoslavia. The Tito clique's boasts of "social self-management," "direct democracy," "power of the whole people," and other deceptive goods have all been exposed as frauds. More and more people in Yugoslavia have seen through the fact that the Tito clique's revisionist "theory" is entirely used to cover up the restoration of capitalism and to maintain bourgeois dictatorship and fascist dictatorship. The revolutionary masses have raised the battle slogans of "opposing fake socialism," "no to the restoration of capitalism," and "down with the 'socialist' aristocracy," fully demonstrating that the broad masses of people under the reactionary rule of the Tito clique are awakening. Their strong dissatisfaction with the reactionary rule of the Tito clique has reached an unstoppable level.

The rise of the revolutionary mass movement in Yugoslavia is not accidental.

The Tito clique has long since surrendered to U.S. imperialism, restored the capitalist system according to the needs of imperialism, sold national sovereignty, and rapidly turned Yugoslavia into a colony of imperialism. The Tito clique and the small clique of bureaucratic comprador bourgeoisie it represents ruthlessly plunder the fruits of the people's labor, causing the economic situation to deteriorate day by day and the people to suffer. Especially since the so-called "economic reform" in 1965, the economy of Yugoslavia has further collapsed, and class differentiation has become much more pronounced. In this country of less than 20 million people, the number of unemployed and those forced to seek livelihood abroad has reached nearly one million. To maintain its rule, the Tito clique continuously strengthens fascist dictatorship. Such retrograde actions cannot but further intensify domestic class contradictions. In recent years, the broad masses of workers and peasants have repeatedly risen up in struggles against exploitation and oppression. The Tito clique has always been sitting on a volcano, and its rule has become increasingly unstable.

Our great teacher Chairman Mao teaches us: "The contradictions of capitalist society manifest themselves as sharp antagonisms and conflicts, as sharp class struggles, and these contradictions cannot be resolved by the capitalist system itself but can only be resolved by the socialist revolution." In countries ruled by modern revisionist cliques such as Yugoslavia, the essence is capitalist countries. There, modern revisionist cliques have usurped power, restored capitalism, turned proletarian dictatorship into bourgeois dictatorship, and restored and developed the system of exploitation. A small privileged class rides on the heads of the people, acting arrogantly, making the laboring masses once again become slaves. No matter what kind of cloak the Tito clique and its ilk wear, or what kind of banner they raise, they cannot cover up the anti-people and counter-revolutionary nature of their power. Where there is oppression, there is resistance. In countries ruled by modern revisionist cliques such as the Soviet Union, there is dark rule, and the people, who make up more than 90% of the population, will definitely rise up in revolution.

All reactionary forces will not voluntarily withdraw from the historical stage. Currently, the Tito clique is using two reactionary tactics to deal with the revolutionary mass movement in Yugoslavia, attempting to use a combination of soft and hard methods to extinguish the flames of the people's resistance. However, the Tito clique's actions are in vain. The rule of revisionism will not last long. The Tito clique and their fellow traitors will inevitably be thrown into the dustbin of history by the people.

    修正主义的统治长不了
    本报评论员
    在法国、美国等资本主义国家兴起的革命群众斗争的风暴，现在已扩展到现代修正主义集团统治的国家。人民愤怒的火焰已经在篡夺了社会主义国家政权的一小撮资产阶级特权阶层的脚下燃烧起来了。
    连日来，在南斯拉夫爆发了反抗铁托叛徒集团反动统治的大规模的学生运动。贝尔格莱德等地的学生愤怒举行示威游行，占领学校，并同反动警察展开英勇搏斗。人民斗争的浪潮有力地冲击着铁托集团的修正主义统治，使美帝和苏修都心惊胆颤。美联社惊呼这是“自第二次世界大战后”还没有过“先例”的，就反映了美帝国主义的这种恐惧。
    铁托集团是美帝国主义推行“和平演变”政策的带头羊。南斯拉夫是美帝国主义多年来苦心经营的一个挂着“社会主义”招牌的橱窗。现在，这个橱窗已经被南斯拉夫学生运动的爆发进一步打碎了。铁托集团吹嘘的什么“社会自治”呀，“直接民主”呀，“‘全民的’政权”呀等等骗人的货色，统统宣告了破产。越来越多的南斯拉夫人民看穿了，铁托集团的这一套修正主义“理论”，完全是用来掩饰资本主义复辟，维护资产阶级专政、法西斯专政的。革命群众提出“反对假社会主义！”“不要资本主义复辟！”“打倒‘社会主义’贵族！”的战斗口号，充分显示处在铁托叛徒集团反动统治下的广大人民正在觉醒，他们对铁托集团反动统治的强烈不满情绪已经到不可遏止的程度了。
    南斯拉夫革命群众运动的兴起，并不是偶然的。
    铁托集团早就投靠美帝国主义，按照帝国主义的需要，复辟资本主义制度，拍卖国家主权，使南斯拉夫迅速地沦为帝国主义的殖民地。铁托集团和它所代表的一小撮官僚买办资产阶级，残酷地掠夺人民的劳动果实，造成经济情况日益恶化，民不聊生。特别是在一九六五年实行所谓“经济改革”以来，南斯拉夫的经济进一步破产，阶级分化更是大大加剧。在这个不到两千万人口的国家中，现在失业和被迫到国外谋生的人数已近一百万。铁托集团为了维持其统治，不断强化法西斯专政。这种倒行逆施，不能不更加加剧国内的阶级矛盾。近年来，广大工人、农民反对剥削和压迫的斗争怒潮此伏彼起。铁托集团一直就是坐在火山口上的，它的统治越来越不稳了。
    我们伟大的导师毛主席教导说：“资本主义社会的矛盾表现为剧烈的对抗和冲突，表现为剧烈的阶级斗争，那种矛盾不可能由资本主义制度本身来解决，而只有社会主义革命才能够加以解决。”在修正主义集团统治下的南斯拉夫等国家，实质上是资本主义国家。在那里，现代修正主义集团篡夺了政权，实行资本主义复辟，把无产阶级专政变成为资产阶级专政，恢复和发展剥削制度，一小撮特权阶层骑在人民头上作威作福，使劳动群众重新沦为被雇佣的奴隶。铁托集团之流不管披着什么样的外衣，打着什么样的旗号，都掩盖不了他们的政权的反人民、反革命性质。有压迫，就有反抗。苏联等现代修正主义集团当政的国家中存在着黑暗统治，这些国家占人口百分之九十以上的人民就一定要起来革命。
    一切反动势力是不会自动退出历史舞台的。目前，铁托集团正在采取反革命两手来对付南斯拉夫的革命群众运动，企图用软硬兼施的手段，把南斯拉夫人民的反抗斗争火焰扑灭下去。但是，铁托集团的这些做法是徒劳的。修正主义的统治是不会长久的。铁托叛徒集团和他们的难兄难弟都必将被人民扔进历史的垃圾堆。
