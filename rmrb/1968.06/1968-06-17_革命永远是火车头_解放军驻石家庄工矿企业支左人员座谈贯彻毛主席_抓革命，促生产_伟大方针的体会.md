Revolution is always the locomotive—People's Liberation Army personnel stationed in Shijiazhuang industrial and mining enterprises discuss implementing Chairman Mao's great directive of "grasp revolution, promote production"

"Revolution is the locomotive of history." The proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad masses of revolutionary workers on the industrial front in Shijiazhuang City have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, using revolution to drive production. The city's industrial production has seen a significant increase, with the total industrial output value for the first four months of this year exceeding the national production plan by 6.8% and growing by 9% compared to the same period last year. Recently, the People's Liberation Army "three-in-one" and "two-army" personnel stationed on the industrial front in Shijiazhuang City held a symposium to exchange experiences and insights on implementing Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production."

Class struggle permeates the production struggle

Comrade Zhang Runting of a certain unit, stationed at the No. 1 Cotton Mill, said: At the beginning of last year, when we first arrived at the No. 1 Cotton Mill to support the leftists, we had an insufficient understanding of Chairman Mao's great directive of "grasp revolution, promote production." We thought that as long as we supported the leftists, that would be enough, and we did not pay enough attention to production. However, the reality of class struggle quickly corrected this erroneous idea. In the early stages of the movement, a small clique of capitalist roaders within the party at the No. 1 Cotton Mill used production tasks to suppress the broad masses of revolutionary workers from rising up. When the proletarian revolutionary factions rose up to rebel against them, they used the pretext of supporting the revolution to incite workers to leave their production posts, stirring up some workers to engage in anarchism, thereby disrupting production and the revolution.

The intense class struggle that unfolded around the production issue made us realize that production struggle is not just about producing materials and increasing wealth; it is always permeated with class struggle and the struggle between two lines. The small clique of capitalist roaders within the party wanted to sabotage the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat and would stop at nothing to sabotage both the revolution and production. To support the leftist masses and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to completion, we must certainly defend and help the broad masses of revolutionary workers implement Chairman Mao's great directive of "grasp revolution, promote production." This is a major issue related to achieving a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.

After our understanding improved, all the personnel stationed at the No. 1 Cotton Mill, with an unyielding class sentiment of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, joined the broad masses of revolutionary workers to smash the various sabotage plots of the small clique of class enemies. We insisted on grasping revolution to promote production. No matter how short-handed we were or how heavy the production tasks were, we always put revolution first and used revolution to drive production. No matter how intense the class struggle was or how tense the revolution was, we never neglected production. Therefore, over the past year, the No. 1 Cotton Mill has achieved a double harvest of revolution and production, completing the national production plan ten days ahead of schedule last year and exceeding the national production plan every month this year.

Firmly grasp class struggle to promote production development

Comrade Zhao Jinwei of a certain unit, stationed at the Shijiazhuang Steel Plant, said: Like other factories and mines, the better the situation of revolution and production at the steel plant, the more frantically the class enemies struggle. In recent periods, a small clique of unrepentant capitalist roaders within the party, remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and untransformed landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements have been active. On one hand, they spread the rightist reversal wind, and on the other hand, they sabotage production, attempting to cause accidents. Once, workers discovered that the temperature of the outer steel plate of the steel furnace was very high and would soon explode. After inspection, it turned out that the water inlet pipe was installed at the water outlet, and the water outlet pipe was installed at the water inlet. The hot water inside could not flow out, and the cold water outside could not flow in. Workers immediately took measures to eliminate the danger and avoided an explosion accident. Revolutionary workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought heightened their revolutionary vigilance and eventually traced the culprit to a stubborn reactionary from a landlord background.

This incident gave the broad masses of revolutionary workers a profound class education. They firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle" and launched a massive exposure and struggle against the class enemies. They rooted out the small clique of unrepentant capitalist roaders, traitors, spies, untransformed landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, as well as the bad elements who had infiltrated the revolutionary mass organizations, one by one, and implemented the dictatorship of the masses.

"Class struggle, once grasped, works wonders." The broad masses of revolutionary workers have significantly heightened their awareness of class struggle and line struggle, more consciously abide by labor discipline, and more fully unleash their labor enthusiasm and creativity. Production volume has been increasing month by month, with steel production in the first four months exceeding the half-year task by 10%.

Revolutionary criticism liberates productive forces

Comrade Li Maoxiu of a certain unit, stationed at the Shijiazhuang Water Pump Factory, said: In the past, under the influence of Khrushchev's "expert management" and his advocacy of the "crawling philosophy," the capitalist roaders in the water pump factory had always believed in foreign methods, using ordinary gray cast iron to manufacture water pumps, and did not encourage workers to boldly experiment and reform. Therefore, the water pumps produced had low quality and short lifespans, far from meeting the needs of socialist construction.

During the Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of revolutionary workers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, launched a revolutionary criticism, especially closely linking the revolutionary criticism with the actual situation of the factory. They focused on eliminating the poison of "expert management" and the "crawling philosophy," kicking away the shackles of foreign dogma, and carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to think, dare to do, and dare to innovate. They overcame various difficulties, repeatedly experimented, and successfully developed a new type of material—wear-resistant cast iron, overcoming the long-standing "old difficult problem," and the water pumps produced had a lifespan six times longer than before.

Since last year, the water pump factory has implemented 22 technological innovations and technological revolutions, significantly improving the production volume and quality of water pumps.

Workers tasted the sweetness of revolutionary criticism and became more enthusiastic about it, and production became better and better. Therefore, they said, revolutionary criticism liberates productive forces.

Workers truly become masters of the factory

Comrade Wang Xianchong of a certain unit, stationed at the Shijiazhuang Lead Wire Weaving Factory, said: The lead wire weaving factory was originally a small handicraft workshop. In the past, influenced by the revisionist management line, it restricted the labor enthusiasm of the workers, and production was always stagnant. Workers demanded mechanized operation, but the capitalist roaders in the factory said, "Manual production is the best, and you can eat anywhere." They did not allow workers to carry out technological innovations. Therefore, there was a popular saying among the workers: "Lead Wire Weaving Factory, Lead Wire Weaving Factory, wooden machines and broken sheds, no matter wind or rain, production is always by the roadside. Heavy manual labor kills people, revolutionary workers suffer. Bad people hold power, evil winds and clouds rise. When will the smoke clear and the clouds disperse? Workers truly become masters of the factory."

During the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, the broad masses of revolutionary workers seized power from the capitalist roaders, severely criticized the revisionist management line of Khrushchev, significantly heightened their awareness of class struggle and line struggle. Revolutionary workers, with an unyielding red heart for Chairman Mao, liberated their minds, overcame all difficulties, and in a short time, carried out more than 20 technological innovations, achieving mechanized operation, and increasing work efficiency by more than 20 times. The broad masses of revolutionary workers proudly said: "Armed with Mao Zedong Thought in our minds, we have the greatest wisdom and the greatest enthusiasm. We can create any miracle in the world!"

    革命永远是火车头
    ——解放军驻石家庄工矿企业支左人员座谈贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的体会
    “革命是历史的火车头。”石家庄市工业战线的无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，以革命带动生产，全市工业生产大幅度上升，今年头四个月，全市工业总产值超额百分之六点八完成国家生产计划，比去年同期增长百分之九。最近，人民解放军驻石家庄市工业战线“三支”“两军”人员举行了座谈会，交流落实毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”伟大号召的经验体会。
    生产斗争中贯穿着阶级斗争
    在国棉一厂支左的某部张润亭同志说：去年初，我们刚到国棉一厂支左时，对毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针认识不足，以为我们支持好左派就行了，对生产抓得不紧。但是，阶级斗争的现实使我们很快改正了这种错误的想法。运动初期，国棉一厂党内一小撮走资派，用生产任务来压制广大革命职工起来革命。当无产阶级革命派起来造他们的反的时候，他们又以支持闹革命为名，煽动工人离开生产岗位，挑动一些职工闹无政府主义，来破坏生产，破坏革命。
    围绕着生产问题所展开的这场激烈的阶级斗争，使我们认识到，生产斗争不是单纯地生产物资，增加财富，而是始终贯穿着阶级斗争和两条路线斗争。党内一小撮走资派要破坏无产阶级文化大革命，必然千方百计地破坏革命和生产。我们要支持左派广大群众，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，就一定要捍卫和帮助广大革命职工落实毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针。这是关系到夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大问题。
    认识提高之后，我们驻国棉一厂全体支左人员，怀着无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的深厚阶级感情，和广大革命职工一起，粉碎一小撮阶级敌人的种种破坏阴谋，坚持抓革命促生产，不管人员多么缺少，生产任务多么繁重，都把革命放在首位，用革命带动生产。不管阶级斗争多么激烈，革命多么紧张，都没有放松生产。因此，一年多来，国棉一厂取得了革命生产双丰收，去年提前十一天完成国家生产计划，今年又月月超额完成国家生产计划。
    狠抓阶级斗争促进生产发展
    在石家庄钢铁厂支左的某部赵金未同志说：钢铁厂和其它厂矿一样，革命和生产的形势越好，阶级敌人就越疯狂挣扎。近一个时期，党内一小撮死不悔改的走资派、国民党反动派的残渣余孽和没有改造好的地富反坏右分子活动频繁。他们一方面刮起右倾翻案妖风，一方面在生产上下毒手，妄图制造事故。有一次，工人们发现炼钢炉的外钢板温度很高，很快就会发生爆炸。经过检查，原来是进水管安在出水口上，出水管安在进水口上，里面的热水流不出来，外面的冷水流不进去。工人们立即采取措施排除了危险，避免了一场爆炸事故。用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命职工，提高了革命警惕，最后追查出是一个大地主出身、坚持反动立场的坏家伙干的。
    这件事，使广大革命职工受到一次深刻的阶级教育。他们牢记毛主席关于“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，向阶级敌人展开了大揭发、大斗争，把破坏革命、破坏生产的一小撮死不悔改的走资派、叛徒、特务、没有改造好的地富反坏右分子，以及混进革命群众组织里的坏人，一个个都揪了出来，实行了群众专政。
    “阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”广大革命职工的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟大大提高，更加自觉地遵守劳动纪律，更加充分发挥劳动积极性和创造性，产量逐月上升，一至四月份，钢材产量超额百分之十完成半年的任务。
    革命大批判解放了生产力
    在石家庄水泵厂支左的某部李茂修同志说：过去，在中国赫鲁晓夫推行“专家治厂”和他鼓吹的“爬行哲学”的影响下，水泵厂的走资派一直迷信洋办法，采用普通白口铸铁制造水泵，不鼓励职工大胆进行试验、改革，因此，制造出来的水泵质量低、寿命短，远远不能满足社会主义建设的需要。
    在文化大革命中，广大革命职工以毛泽东思想为武器，开展了革命大批判，特别是把革命大批判同本厂的实际紧密结合起来，着重清除“专家治厂”、“爬行哲学”的流毒，踢开洋教条的束缚，发扬敢想、敢干、敢创造的革命精神，排除各种困难，反复试验成功一种新型材料——耐磨铸铁，攻克了长期以来被称为“老大难”的关键，制造出来的水泵使用时间比原来延长六倍。
    去年以来，水泵厂实现了二十二项技术革新、技术革命，水泵的产量和质量大大提高。
    职工们尝到革命大批判的甜头，越批越起劲，生产越来越好。因此，他们说，革命大批判解放了生产力。
    工人真正当家作主张
    在石家庄铅丝编织厂支左的某部王宪崇同志说：铅丝编织厂原是个手工业操作的小工厂，过去受到修正主义办厂路线的影响，限制了工人的劳动积极性，生产一直死气沉沉。工人们要求实行机械操作，厂内走资派说：“手工生产一招先，就可以吃遍天。”不让工人搞技术革新。因此，工人中曾流传着这样的顺口溜：“铅编厂，铅编厂，木机席棚破厂房，不管刮风和下雨，一年四季生产在路旁。笨重的手工劳动害死人，革命职工遭了殃。坏人当道把权掌，歪风邪气乌云涨。何时烟消乌云过，工人真正当家作主张。”
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，广大革命职工夺了走资派的权，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义办厂路线，大大提高了阶级斗争觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟。革命职工靠无限忠于毛主席的一颗红心，解放思想，排除万难，在不长时间内，就搞成了大小二十多项技术革新，实现了机械操作，提高工效二十多倍。广大革命职工豪迈地说：“用毛泽东思想武装头脑，就有最大的智慧，最大的干劲，什么人间奇迹也能创造出来！”
