The busier, the more important it is to grasp the direction

Study Group Member of Chairman Mao's Works, Director of Dianli Village, Militia Member Miu Bin

The Chinese Khrushchev speaks sweetly with a knife hidden in his heart. On the surface, he pretends to be gentle as a dove, talking about "fighting to improve the lives of peasants" and "this requires us to do a good job in production." But in reality, he harbors the heart of a wolf, intending to use the "production first" trick to deceive us into working all day long, turning us into people who do not care about state affairs, confused people who lose the socialist direction, so that he can restore capitalism in China, pushing us broad masses of militia members and poor and lower-middle peasants back into the fire and hell! It is truly evil and poisonous!

The number one capitalist roader in Jiangsu, Jiang Weiqing, following the orders of his master, the Chinese Khrushchev, came to our Jiaoqian Village to spread poison: "The biggest problem now is to do everything possible to improve production." The local capitalist roaders personally came to our place to create a "production first" model. He shouted, "Politics is like wearing boots and hats, only good production is like real money." "Whether it's a cat's head or a dog's head, good production is the right way." Under this guidance, he used the method of "economic leadership, material leadership, fertilizer follow-up, and work points not reduced" to burn "small stoves" and eat "special meals," cultivating six mu of "special cotton." Later, he mobilized the entire commune's militia and poor and lower-middle peasants to come and learn from this "experience," attempting to use this to suppress our Jiaoqian's vigorous movement to study Chairman Mao's works and reverse the socialist direction. This is intolerable!

In the past, I was also once poisoned by the "production first" theory and lost my way. During the busy season, I thought about grain, oil, and cotton, talked about harvesting, planting, and cultivating, and focused on water, fertilizer, and seeds. What about politics, what about class struggle, what about the revolutionization of people's thoughts, all forgotten. As a result, production naturally did not go up. In this situation, I was as anxious as an ant on a hot pan, not knowing what to do. I couldn't eat or sleep, thinking and thinking, finally coming up with the idea of "clear pricing, heavy rewards during the busy season" to motivate the militia members and commune members' "enthusiasm"! I didn't know that the more work points I added, the more I encouraged some commune members' selfishness. They worked more roughly, and their direction became more deviated. This way, the more I grasped, the busier I got, the busier I got, the more chaotic I became, busy to the point of dizziness, unable to distinguish the direction, walking further and further astray!

Since the Cultural Revolution, we have repeatedly studied the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings on politics being the commander and the soul, deeply understanding that if we do not pay attention to political and ideological work and busy ourselves with trivial matters all day, we will lose the socialist direction, which is very dangerous. We have understood the truth of Comrade Lin Biao's instruction that "having politics in one's mind means having a direction." We have paid attention to grasping the socialist direction the busier we are. During the busy production season, it is also the season of political "busyness." During the busy season, we insist on "five to the fields": Chairman Mao's portrait is hung in the fields; Chairman Mao's latest instructions are studied in the fields; songs of Chairman Mao's quotations are sung in the fields; study and application meetings of Chairman Mao's works are held in the fields; and the revolutionary criticism battlefield is set up in the fields. Because we have grasped the "life root" and corrected the "steering wheel," therefore, during the busy season, cadres and commune members are full of fighting spirit and vigor, making harvesting, planting, cultivating, and managing various agricultural tasks more, faster, better, and more economical. Recently, the whole commune's revolutionary and production inspection, our brigade jumped from the tail of the commune to the head. It can be seen that politics is in command, the direction is clear, and production is fast; politics is not in command, the direction is not clear, and production drops. From our own experience, we understand that busyness means many and sharp contradictions. At this time, it is especially necessary to use Mao Zedong Thought to mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses to solve the contradictions in the work. During the busy season, it is easy to lose direction, and once the direction is lost, the further one goes on the wrong path, the greater the harm.

The Chinese Khrushchev's "production first" theory aims to sabotage collective production and restore capitalism. We must raise the revolutionary banner of criticism higher and higher, criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev and his like, along with the "production first" theory they advocate and promote, until they are criticized like a pile of rotten dog shit, so that people will no longer be deceived by it.

    越忙越要掌握方向
    学习毛主席著作积极分子  墩里大队队长、基干民兵  缪斌
    中国赫鲁晓夫嘴里说出糖来，心里藏起刀来。他表面装得温良如鸽，说什么要“为改良农民的生活而斗争”，“这就要把生产搞好”。但骨子里却安下虎狼之心，妄想通过“生产第一”这一勾魂计，诱骗我们整天埋头生产，变成不关心国家大事的木头人，迷失社会主义方向的糊涂人，好让他在中国复辟资本主义，把我们广大民兵、贫下中农重新推进火海，打入地狱！真是罪恶滔天，毒透毒透！
    江苏省头号走资派江渭清秉承主子中国赫鲁晓夫的旨意，来到我们角斜大放毒气：“现在最大的问题是千方百计地搞好生产。”本地的走资派亲自出马，来到我们这里搞“生产第一”的样板，他叫嚷什么：“抓政治是穿靴戴帽，抓好生产才是现钞。”“不管猫头、狗头，搞好生产就对头。”在这种思想指导下，他采用“经济挂帅，物资带头，化肥跟上，工分不让”的办法，大烧“小灶”，大吃“偏饭”，培养了六亩“特殊棉花”。以后，还兴师动众，组织全社民兵、贫下中农前来参观取“经”，妄图以此把我们角斜轰轰烈烈的学习毛主席著作运动打下去，把社会主义方向倒转来，是可忍，孰不可忍！
    过去，我也曾一度中了“生产第一”论的毒，迷失了方向。每到大忙，想的是粮、油、棉，谈的是收、种、培，抓的是水、肥、种。什么政治，什么阶级斗争，什么人的思想革命化，统统忘记了。结果，生产当然也上不去。在这种情况下，我急得象热锅上的蚂蚁团团转，不知如何是好。我饭吃不香，觉睡不着，想呀，想呀，终于想出了“明码标价，大忙重奖”的一套工分挂帅的办法，心想，这下子可以调动民兵、社员“积极性”了！那晓得事与愿违，工分越加越大，助长了一部分社员的私心，他们干活越来越粗，方向越来越偏。就这样越抓越忙，越忙越乱，忙得头昏目浊，辨不清方向，在邪路上越走越远！
    自从文化大革命以来，我们反复学习了伟大领袖毛主席关于政治是统帅，是灵魂的教导，深深体会到，如果不注意政治思想工作，成天忙于事务，就要迷失社会主义方向，这是非常危险的。我们懂得了林副主席所指示的“头脑里有了政治就有了方向”的道理，注意了越忙越要掌握社会主义方向，生产大忙季节，也是政治“大忙”季节。大忙中坚持“五到田头”，雷打不动：毛主席像竖到田头；毛主席最新指示学到田头；毛主席语录歌唱到田头；毛主席著作学习讲用会搬到田头；革命大批判战场摆到田头。由于抓住了“命根子”，端正了“方向盘”，因而，大忙期间干部和社员斗志昂扬，意气风发，收、种、培、管等各项农活搞得又多、又快、又好、又省。最近，全社革命、生产大检查，我们大队一下子由全社的“排尾”跃居为“排头”。可见，政治挂了帅，方向看得准，生产上得快；政治不挂帅，方向看不准，生产往下掉。从我们自己的经验中，我们懂得了，忙，就是矛盾很多，很尖锐。这时候，特别需要用毛泽东思想来调动广大群众的积极性和创造性，来解决工作中的矛盾。在大忙中间，容易迷失方向，而一旦迷失了方向，在错误的路上越走越远，危害也越大。
    中国赫鲁晓夫“生产第一”论，目的是破坏集体生产，复辟资本主义。我们一定要更高地举起革命的批判大旗，把中国赫鲁晓夫之流连同他们鼓吹和推行的“生产第一”论，批得象一堆臭狗屎，使人们不再上它的当。
