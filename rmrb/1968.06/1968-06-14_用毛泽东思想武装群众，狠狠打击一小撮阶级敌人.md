Our great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship." Chairman Mao's brilliant instruction thoroughly exposes the counter-revolutionary essence of all forms of bourgeois dictatorship in the world, thoroughly exposes the counter-revolutionary essence of the bourgeois reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchov, and points out to us the great historical significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in consolidating the proletarian dictatorship.

Through repeated study of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and combined with over a year of military training practice, we have deeply realized that whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental dividing line between revolution and counter-revolution, and the watershed between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the bourgeois reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchov. Chairman Mao's great teaching is the fundamental guideline for us to do a good job in military training, and it is also the beacon guiding us to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Over a year of military training practice has taught us: only by arming the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, mobilizing the masses, and striking hard at a handful of class enemies, can we consolidate the newly born revolutionary committees and better protect the people.

Last March, when Tianjin Yan'an Middle School achieved revolutionary great unity by class, this new thing just emerged, and we gave it resolute support. However, a handful of class enemies were terrified and hated it to the core, deceiving some people who did not understand the truth to oppose us. In such a situation, we repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teaching, "If we cannot liberate the whole of mankind, the proletariat itself cannot ultimately be liberated," on the one hand, we helped revolutionary teachers and students nurture and cherish this new thing, and on the other hand, we mobilized revolutionary teachers and students to direct their deep hatred towards the class enemies, insisting on using Mao Zedong Thought to educate the masses. Under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, the proletarian consciousness of the broad masses has greatly improved, thus developing and consolidating the revolutionary great unity, making the class enemies' plots suffer a shameful failure.

Last August and September, when the broad revolutionary teachers and students of Yan'an Middle School were working hard to better implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, enthusiastically helping the school revolutionary committee to correct its shortcomings, a handful of class enemies who were unwilling to die thought they had an opportunity and again used bourgeois factionalism to deceive some people, directing their attacks at the revolutionary committee. In such a situation, we followed Chairman Mao's teaching, "First, be ruthless towards the enemy, suppress it, and annihilate it; second, be united with your own people, with the people, with comrades, with superiors, and with subordinates." We mobilized the masses, conducted mass exposure, criticism, and struggle against a handful of class enemies who maliciously attacked and sabotaged the school revolutionary committee; we persuaded and educated the masses who were temporarily deceived by bad people, helping them to raise their class consciousness; we praised those revolutionary teachers and students who, from the standpoint of revolutionary interests, enthusiastically helped the revolutionary committee to further achieve revolutionization, adopted their correct opinions, and supported and protected their political enthusiasm. As a result, we not only struck hard at a handful of class enemies but also, in the struggle, educated the broad revolutionary masses, further raising the revolutionary masses' class struggle consciousness and two-line struggle awareness, thus further consolidating the newly born revolutionary committee.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a political revolution under socialist conditions, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the broad revolutionary people under its leadership and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Our military training team and the comrades of the Yan'an Middle School Revolutionary Committee, together with all the revolutionary teachers and students of the school, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon, mobilizing the masses, and continuously carrying out revolutionary big criticism, launching a more fierce attack on the class enemies. In the struggle, we used Chairman Mao's relevant teachings to educate all the revolutionary teachers and students of the school, always paying attention to strictly distinguishing between two types of different contradictions, mobilizing all revolutionary forces, concentrating firepower, concentrating targets, and accurately and ruthlessly striking at a handful of class enemies. Recently, the revolutionary teachers and students of Yan'an Middle School, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, exposed the scoundrels who attempted to rehabilitate a handful of capitalist roaders within the party and viciously attacked the revolutionary committee, powerfully defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and safeguarding the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we are determined to further fully mobilize the masses, together with the broad revolutionary masses, deeply carry out revolutionary big criticism, accurately and ruthlessly strike at a handful of class enemies, further consolidate the proletarian dictatorship, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    用毛泽东思想武装群众，狠狠打击一小撮阶级敌人
    天津延安中学军训团
    我们伟大领袖毛主席最近指示我们：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”毛主席这一光辉指示，透彻地揭露了世界上一切形式的资产阶级专政共同的反革命本质，透彻地揭露了中国赫鲁晓夫资产阶级反动路线的反革命本质，向我们指出了无产阶级文化大革命对巩固无产阶级专政的伟大历史意义。
    反复学习毛主席的最新指示，结合一年多来的军训工作的实践，我们深刻地认识到，保护还是镇压广大人民群众，这是革命与反革命的根本界限，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线同中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线的分水岭。毛主席这一伟大教导，是我们搞好军训工作的根本准则，也是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的指路明灯。
    一年多来的军训实践告诉我们：只有用毛泽东思想武装群众，发动群众，狠狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，才能巩固新生的革命委员会，更好地保护人民群众。
    去年三月，天津延安中学按班级实现革命大联合这一新生事物刚刚出现，我们就给予坚决的支持。可是，一小撮阶级敌人却怕得要死，恨得要命，蒙蔽一些不明真象的群众来反对我们。在这样的情况下，我们反复学习了毛主席“如果不能解放全人类，无产阶级自己就不能最后地得到解放”的教导，一方面帮助革命师生扶植爱护这一新生事物，同时发动革命师生把千仇万恨集中到阶级敌人身上，坚持用毛泽东思想去教育群众。在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，广大群众的无产阶级觉悟有很大提高，从而发展和巩固了革命的大联合，使阶级敌人的阴谋遭到了可耻的失败。
    去年八、九月份，正当延安中学广大革命师生为了更好地落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，热情地帮助校革委会改正缺点的时候，不甘心死亡的一小撮阶级敌人以为有机可乘，又利用资产阶级派性，蒙蔽一部分人，把矛头指向革命委员会。在这种情况下，我们遵循毛主席“第一对敌人要狠，要压倒它，要消灭它；第二对自己人、对人民、对同志、对官长、对部下要和，要团结”的教导，发动群众，对于恶意攻击、破坏校革委会的一小撮阶级敌人进行了群众性的大揭发、大批判、大斗争；对于一时受坏人蒙蔽的群众进行了说服教育，帮助他们提高阶级觉悟；对于从革命利益出发，热情帮助革委会进一步实现革命化的革命师生进行了表扬，采纳了他们的正确意见，支持和保护他们的政治热情。这样做的结果，既狠狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人，也在斗争中教育了广大革命群众，进一步提高了革命群众的阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争觉悟，从而进一步巩固了新生的革委会。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”我们军训团和延安中学革委会的同志们同全校革命师生一起，反复学习毛主席这一最新指示，以毛主席这一最新指示为武器，发动群众，持续地开展革命大批判，向阶级敌人发动了更加猛烈的进攻。在斗争中，我们用毛主席有关教导教育全校革命师生，时刻注意严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，调动一切革命力量，集中火力，集中目标，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人。不久前，延安中学的革命师生，在毛泽东思想指引下，揪出了妄图为党内一小撮走资派翻案，恶毒攻击革命委员会的坏家伙，有力地捍卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，保卫了无产阶级文化大革命的胜利成果。
    在毛主席最新指示的指引下，我们决心进一步充分发动群众，和广大革命群众一起，深入开展革命的大批判，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，进一步巩固无产阶级专政，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
