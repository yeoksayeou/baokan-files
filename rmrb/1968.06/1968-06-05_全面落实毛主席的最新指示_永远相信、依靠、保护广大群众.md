At a time when the entire nation's military and civilian population is advancing triumphantly in a great situation to seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our great leader and supreme commander Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao received the Chinese People's Liberation Army's soldiers and officers. This is the greatest concern and encouragement for the entire nation's military and civilian population. We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and in the great struggle to seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, create new merits for the people.

Recently, our great leader Chairman Mao taught us: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." Chairman Mao's latest instructions will further mobilize the enthusiasm of tens of millions of revolutionary masses, advance triumphantly, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Trusting the masses and relying on the masses is our Party's fine tradition and the boundless source of our revolutionary strength. Chairman Mao taught us: "Revolutionary war is the war of the masses; it can be waged only by mobilizing the masses and relying on them." Looking back at the more than two years of struggle, we have come to realize: the attitude toward the masses is the dividing line between the proletarian revolutionary line and the bourgeois reactionary line, and a fundamental difference between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. The proletarian revolutionary line lies in trusting the masses, relying on the masses, protecting the masses, and respecting the revolutionary initiative of the masses. The bourgeois reactionary line, on the other hand, does not trust the masses, fears the masses, suppresses the masses, treats the masses as pawns, and imposes bourgeois dictatorship on the masses. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great political revolution. Only by fully mobilizing the masses can we carry out this political revolution, and only by supporting the masses' initiative can we lead this political revolution from victory to victory. In the past, in the arduous struggle, we have always followed Chairman Mao's instruction to "organize tens of millions of people, mobilize a vast revolutionary army," believing in the masses, relying on the masses, protecting the masses, and uniting the majority of the masses to achieve one victory after another. Today, as we strive for the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must even more support and protect the broad revolutionary masses to advance triumphantly and achieve new victories.

To truly protect the broad revolutionary masses, we must strictly distinguish between contradictions among the people and those between ourselves and the enemy, always directing the spearhead of struggle at a handful of class enemies, and never at our class brothers and revolutionary masses. Those who have taken the wrong side are mostly due to ideological misunderstandings; in the past, they may have said or done wrong things, but the responsibility lies not with the masses but with a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. Therefore, under any circumstances, we must insist on uniting the masses, firmly grasp the direction of struggle, and educate more masses to unite under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought to achieve new victories.

Chairman Mao instructs us to act accordingly, and we advance at Chairman Mao's command. The great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions are of great significance. We must strive to study them, implement them resolutely, propagate them enthusiastically, and defend them bravely. Like Comrade Tan Zhonglin, we must never leave the masses, always trust the masses, rely on the masses, protect the masses, and maintain close ties with the broad masses to seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    全面落实毛主席的最新指示  永远相信、依靠、保护广大群众
    空直机关无产阶级革命派
    正当全国亿万军民在一片大好形势下乘胜前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的时刻，我们伟大领袖、伟大统帅毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席接见中国人民解放军指战员，这是对全国军民的最大关怀、最大鼓舞。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中，为人民立新功。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”毛主席的最新指示将进一步调动千百万革命群众的积极性，乘胜前进，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    相信群众，依靠群众，是我们党的优良传统，是我们革命力量的无限源泉。毛主席教导我们：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”回顾两年多的战斗历程，我们体会到：对待群众的态度问题，是无产阶级革命路线同资产阶级反动路线的分水岭，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的一个根本区别。无产阶级革命路线，就在于相信群众，依靠群众，保护群众，尊重群众的革命首创精神，而资产阶级反动路线就在于它不相信群众，害怕群众，镇压群众，把群众当阿斗，对群众实行资产阶级专政。无产阶级文化大革命是一场伟大的政治大革命，只有充分发动群众，才能进行这场政治大革命，只有支持群众的首创精神，才能引导这场政治大革命从胜利走向胜利。过去，我们在艰苦的斗争中，始终遵照毛主席“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要”的教导，相信群众，依靠群众，保护群众，团结大多数群众，取得了一个又一个的胜利。在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的今天，我们更要支持、保护广大革命群众，才能乘胜前进，夺取新的胜利。
    要真正做到保护广大革命群众，必须严格区别敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾，始终把斗争矛头指向一小撮阶级敌人，而绝不能指向自己的阶级兄弟和革命群众。站错队的群众，多是由于思想认识问题，过去说了错话，办了错事，但责任不在群众，而在党内一小撮走资派。因此，不论在任何情况下，都要坚持团结群众，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，教育更多的群众团结在毛泽东思想的旗帜下，夺取新的胜利。
    毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进。伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，具有伟大的意义，我们一定要努力学习、坚决贯彻、热情宣传、勇敢捍卫，象门合同志那样，一时一刻也不脱离群众，永远相信群众，依靠群众，保护群众，同广大群众保持密切的联系，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
