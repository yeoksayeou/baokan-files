The broad masses of workers at Anshan Iron and Steel Company, with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, have been vigorously carrying out class struggle and persistently conducting revolutionary criticism and self-criticism. As a result, both revolution and production have shown a highly inspiring situation.

Since this year, the production levels of various factories and mines in Anshan have been steadily rising. Since mid-March, the entire company has created fifteen new production records, seven of which are the highest since the start of operations, and eight have surpassed records set since 1960. Based on the significant increase in the production of major products in April compared to March, the production of major products such as pig iron, steel ingots, steel materials, and metallurgical coke in May has again increased significantly compared to April. New products are being continuously produced, and new technologies and techniques are constantly emerging. Currently, large quantities of high-quality pig iron, steel ingots, and steel materials produced by Anshan Steel are being shipped out, providing strong support for the country's socialist revolution and socialist construction.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "One of the important tasks on our ideological front at present is to carry out a criticism of revisionism." In the process of seizing revolution and promoting production, the broad masses of revolutionary workers and cadres at Anshan Steel have insisted on carrying out revolutionary criticism and self-criticism. The broad masses of workers say that only by persistently conducting revolutionary criticism and self-criticism can we distinguish between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, and only then can we firmly walk the socialist path, consciously use revolution to guide production, and achieve double victories in revolution and production. The broad masses of revolutionary workers and cadres, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have exposed and criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of managing enterprises advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Anshan. They have been relentlessly attacking the class enemies. The revolutionary criticism and self-criticism have greatly heightened the class consciousness and the consciousness of the struggle between the two lines among the broad masses of revolutionary workers and cadres, leading to a significant change in people's spiritual outlook and a new situation of great development in steel production at Anshan Steel.

The revolutionary workers of the three major steelmaking plants at Anshan Steel have insisted on holding various forms of revolutionary criticism and self-criticism in the production workshops and by the steelmaking furnaces to eliminate the long-standing revisionist poison spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents at Anshan Steel. The steelmaking workers regard seizing revolution, promoting production, producing more steel, and producing good steel as an important sign of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They see it as a powerful blow to the class enemies. The First Steel Plant completed the state's steel production plan for April ahead of schedule by two days on the basis of overfulfilling the plan. The other two steel plants also achieved double victories in revolution and production.

The revolutionary criticism and self-criticism have promoted the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to continuously deepen. The broad masses of workers have been studying and applying the "Three Articles" extensively, combining the struggle against selfishness with the criticism of revisionism, promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking, and greatly enhancing the enthusiasm for revolution and production. The revolutionary workers of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant, in the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, have all taken to the stage to share their experiences, discuss their understandings, struggle against selfishness, and criticize revisionism, with their spiritual outlook completely renewed. This plant, on the basis of completing the state's production plan every month this year, overfulfilled the state's plan in May and successfully produced a batch of advanced-level special-shaped steel tubes and precision steel tubes.

Currently, the broad masses of revolutionary workers at Anshan Steel are deeply engaged in learning from Comrade Men Hesheng, who is loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The broad masses of revolutionary workers and cadres have all expressed their determination to take Comrade Men Hesheng as an example, to be loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, to seize revolution, to promote production, and to achieve greater victories in revolution and production.

    鞍钢革命生产出现一片大好形势
    革命职工和干部的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高，人的精神面貌大改变，钢铁生产出现大发展的崭新局面，各厂矿生产水平节节上升，五月份主要产品产量有较大幅度提高
    新华社鞍山八日电　鞍山钢铁公司广大革命职工在人民解放军的大力帮助下，狠抓阶级斗争，坚持深入持久地开展革命大批判，使革命和生产出现了一派鼓舞人心的大好形势。
    今年以来，鞍山各厂矿生产水平节节上升。三月中旬以来，全公司创造了十五项生产新纪录，其中有七项是开工以来的最高纪录，有八项刷新了一九六○年以来的纪录。在主要产品的产量四月份比三月份有大幅度提高的基础上，五月份全公司生铁、钢锭、钢材和冶金焦等主要产品的产量，又比四月有较大幅度的提高。新产品陆续制成，新工艺、新技术不断出现。现在，鞍钢生产的大批优质生铁、钢锭和钢材，正源源外运，有力地支援了国家的社会主义革命和社会主义建设。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判。”鞍钢广大革命职工、革命干部在抓革命促生产中，坚持开展革命的大批判。广大职工说，只有深入持久地开展革命大批判，才能分清什么是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，什么是中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，才能坚定不移地走社会主义道路，自觉地用革命统帅生产，夺取革命、生产双胜利。广大革命职工、革命干部，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在鞍山的代理人推行的反革命修正主义办企业路线进行了大揭发、大批判，不停顿地向阶级敌人猛烈进攻。革命的大批判，大大提高了广大革命职工和革命干部的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，使鞍钢出现了人的精神面貌大改变，钢铁生产大发展的崭新局面。
    鞍钢三大炼钢厂的革命工人，坚持在生产车间里，在炼钢炉旁不断地举行各种不同形式的革命大批判，肃清中国赫鲁晓夫及其在鞍钢的代理人长期以来散布的修正主义流毒。炼钢工人把狠抓革命，猛促生产，多炼钢，炼好钢，看作是忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的一个重要标志，看作是对阶级敌人的有力打击。第一炼钢厂在超额完成四月份国家炼钢生产计划的基础上，五月份又提前两天完成了国家计划。其它两个兄弟钢厂也都取得了革命、生产双丰收。
    革命的大批判，推动了活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动不断深入发展。广大革命职工大学大用“老三篇”，把斗私和批修紧密地结合起来，促进了人的思想革命化，革命、生产的积极性大大高涨。无缝钢管厂革命职工在活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动中，人人登台谈心得，讲体会，斗私批修，精神面貌焕然一新。这个厂在今年月月完成国家生产计划的基础上，五月份又超额完成国家计划，并且试制出一批具有先进水平的异型钢管和精密钢管。
    目前，鞍钢广大革命职工正在深入开展向“无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部”门合同志学习的热潮。广大革命职工和革命干部纷纷表示，一定要以门合同志为榜样，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，狠抓革命，猛促生产，夺取革命、生产的更大胜利。
