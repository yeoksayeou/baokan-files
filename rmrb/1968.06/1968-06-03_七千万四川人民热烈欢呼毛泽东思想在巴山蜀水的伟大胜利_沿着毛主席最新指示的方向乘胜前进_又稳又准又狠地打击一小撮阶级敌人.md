The 40 million revolutionary people of Sichuan Province, filled with revolutionary enthusiasm and joy of victory, warmly celebrate the glorious birth of the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Committee in the storm of class struggle, warmly celebrate the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, and warmly celebrate the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

On this day of great joy and celebration, various cities and rural areas across the province held grand celebrations. Everywhere was a scene of jubilation. The 40 million revolutionary people, with deep proletarian feelings, wish the great leader Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!

Revolutionary cadres and broad masses of revolutionary people across the province, while celebrating the establishment of the provincial revolutionary committee, earnestly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." They also studied the important editorials "40 Million Sichuan People Are Advancing" from the *People's Daily* and the *Liberation Army Daily*. Members of the Sichuan Provincial and Chengdu Municipal Revolutionary Committees, after studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, excitedly said, "Chairman Mao's latest instructions have further pointed out the direction for the construction, consolidation, and development of revolutionary committees at all levels. We will resolutely implement and follow them. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, always believe in and rely on the broad masses of the people, respect the initiative of the masses, fully mobilize the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, adhere to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and build the revolutionary committee into a battle command center that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizes proletarian politics, and leads the revolutionary masses in a fierce attack on the enemies of the proletariat."

The revolutionary masses of Chengdu City, with actions to launch a new high tide of the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought on a larger scale, celebrated the establishment of the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Committee. On the day after the establishment of the provincial revolutionary committee, the city distributed a large number of Chairman Mao's brilliant works and the *Quotations from Chairman Mao*. Today, they earnestly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They excitedly said, "It was the great leader Chairman Mao who personally ignited the blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It was the invincible Mao Zedong Thought that guided us through one stormy wave after another in the class struggle. It was Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line that led us to achieve decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, be loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao with a 'loyal' heart, grasp the use of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, learn from Comrade Deng Zhongxian, who is loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, think of Chairman Mao in everything, obey Chairman Mao in everything, follow Chairman Mao in everything, and do everything for Chairman Mao."

On May 31, tens of thousands of revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and soldiers of the garrison in Chongqing City held a grand rally to warmly celebrate the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought in the mountains and rivers of Sichuan. The broad masses of military and civilians, holding red *Quotations from Chairman Mao*, surrounding the giant portrait of Chairman Mao, and carrying placards and banners with Chairman Mao's quotations such as "Sichuan has great hope" and "Warmly celebrate the establishment of the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Committee," flooded into the city center from early morning to celebrate the birth of the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Committee. Many factories, enterprises, institutions, schools, and art troupes' revolutionary cadres and Red Guards wrote articles, held symposiums, sang praises of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and expressed their love for the newly born Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Committee and their determination to defend the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The revolutionary cadres and broad masses of revolutionary people in Yibin, Zigong, Leshan, and Wanzhou pointed out excitedly when celebrating the birth of the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Committee that the establishment of the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Committee was the result of the struggle between the revolutionary cadres and broad masses of the province and a handful of capitalist roaders under the illumination of Mao Zedong Thought. They decided to follow the great teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, "The rights obtained by the people must not be easily lost and must be defended with struggle," to enthusiastically love and support the newly born revolutionary committee, help it to consolidate and develop continuously, be vigilant and smash the enemy's plots to shake and overthrow the revolutionary committee. They decided to carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, continuously improve class consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness, continue to grasp the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, oppose right opportunism, right splitism, and right capitulationism, smash the right reversal wind, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, deeply and persistently carry out the revolutionary criticism, and steadily, accurately, and fiercely strike at the enemies of the proletariat. They must expose, criticize, and overthrow thoroughly Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the party such as Liu Shaoqi and their agents in Southwest and Sichuan like Li Pingyuan, Liao Zhigao, Ren Baige, and Huang Xinting, and eliminate the poison of their counter-revolutionary revisionism. They must do a good job in cleaning up the class ranks, root out the traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries hiding in the dark corners, and further consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres in various places expressed that they must firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, strictly distinguish between the two different types of contradictions, strengthen the firm unity of revolutionary mass organizations, and develop revolutionary great alliances and revolutionary three-in-ones by system, industry, and class. They must further carry out the "support the army and love the people" activities and strengthen military-civilian unity. They must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness," further implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.
