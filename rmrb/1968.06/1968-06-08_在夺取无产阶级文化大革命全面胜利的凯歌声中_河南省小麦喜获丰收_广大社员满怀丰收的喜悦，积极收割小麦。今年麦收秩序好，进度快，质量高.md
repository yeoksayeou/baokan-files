The broad masses of commune members, filled with the joy of a good harvest, are actively harvesting wheat. This year, the order of wheat harvesting is good, the progress is fast, and the quality is high.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, June 6th - In the triumphant songs of the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Henan has achieved a bumper wheat harvest this year.

"Look at the golden waves of rice and wheat, heroes everywhere under the evening smoke." In recent days, the vast central plains have presented a bustling scene. From the plains of eastern and northern Henan to the hilly regions of western Henan, from the Nanyang Basin to the banks of the Huai River, teams of commune members harvesting wheat, holding high the portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao and the quotations from Chairman Mao, carrying their tools, start towards the fields at dawn, until dusk, the crowds and transport vehicles are still coming and going. This year, the order of wheat harvesting is good, the progress is fast, and the quality is high. The broad masses of people are extremely excited and say, "This is a miracle created by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!"

This year, Henan's bumper wheat harvest is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses in the countryside of the whole province, taking Comrade Lin Biao as a shining example, with deep proletarian feelings, study and apply Mao Zedong Thought actively, study every day, use it every day, and extensively carry out the "three loyalties" activity of being absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, making the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought penetrate into every corner of the fields, farmlands, construction sites, and homes. Various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes are held in various places, with more than 20 million people participating. In the study classes, the broad revolutionary masses fiercely fight against the bourgeois "self," fiercely criticize revisionism, firmly establish the proletarian "public," and plant the "loyalty" to Chairman Mao, turning spiritual strength into great material strength. The Nanyang region, due to the extensive holding of various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, promoted the revolutionization of people's thoughts, pushed forward the development of production, and made the more than 80 million mu of wheat in this region universally achieve a bumper harvest. The revolutionary masses in northern and eastern Henan, through studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, established the thought of daring to struggle and daring to win, overcame the long-term drought, and achieved a bumper wheat harvest, and also produced a number of high-yield units.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat under the conditions of socialism to criticize and repudiate the bourgeoisie and all other exploiting classes; it is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang reactionaries led by the broad revolutionary masses; it is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." The revolutionary committees at various levels in Henan Province have studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, led the broad masses of the people to firmly grasp class struggle, deeply carry out revolutionary criticism and struggle, and combined with the local class struggle reality, launched a powerful criticism against the reactionary revisionist black goods such as the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" and the "theory of the merits of exploitation" spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Henan, and gave a heavy blow to a handful of class enemies, greatly raising the class struggle awareness and line struggle awareness of the broad revolutionary masses, further consolidating and developing the collective economy, and creating extremely favorable conditions for this year's bumper wheat harvest.

The revolutionary committees at various levels in Henan Province, in accordance with the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction that "the reform of state organs, the most fundamental thing, is to link up with the masses," as soon as the wheat harvest began, organized many propaganda teams with the main content of propagating the heroic deeds of Comrade Menhu, to go deep into the frontline of wheat harvesting, propagating the deeds of Menhu, propagating Mao Zedong Thought. The comrades in the propaganda teams, taking Menhu as an example, labored with the commune members, grasped class struggle with the revolutionary masses, and effectively promoted the victory of the summer harvest work.

    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中
    河南省小麦喜获丰收
    广大社员满怀丰收的喜悦，积极收割小麦。今年麦收秩序好，进度快，质量高
    新华社郑州六日电  在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，河南今年小麦获得丰收。
    “喜看稻菽千重浪，遍地英雄下夕烟。”近几天来，辽阔中原呈现一片繁忙景象。从豫东、豫北平原到豫西丘陵地区，从南阳盆地到淮河之滨，一队队收割小麦的社员，高举伟大领袖毛主席的画像和毛主席语录牌，带着工具，天刚蒙蒙亮就走向田间收割小麦，直到黄昏，人群和运输车辆还来往不断。今年麦收秩序好，进度快，质量高。广大群众无限兴奋地说：“这是无产阶级文化大革命创造的奇迹！”
    今年，河南小麦获得丰收，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。全省农村广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众以林副主席为光辉榜样，带着深厚的无产阶级感情，活学活用毛泽东思想，天天学，天天用，广泛地开展了无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的“三忠于”活动，使活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动深入到田间、地头、工地、家庭等各个角落。各地大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，参加学习班的有两千多万人次。在学习班里，广大革命群众狠斗资产阶级的“私”字，狠批修正主义，大立无产阶级的“公”字，大树对毛主席的“忠”字，精神力量化为巨大的物质力量。南阳地区由于大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，促进了人的思想革命化，推动了生产的发展，使这个地区的八百多万亩小麦，普遍获得大丰收。豫北和豫东地区的广大革命群众，通过活学活用毛主席著作，树立了敢于斗争，敢于胜利的思想，战胜了长期干旱，夺得了小麦丰收，并且还出现了一批高产单位。
    毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”河南省各级革命委员会学习了毛主席的最新指示，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，率领广大人民群众，狠抓阶级斗争，深入开展革命的大批判，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在河南的代理人所散布的“阶级斗争熄灭”论、“剥削有功”等一套反革命修正主义黑货，结合当地的阶级斗争实际，进行了有力的批判，狠狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人，大大提高了广大革命群众的阶级斗争觉悟和路线斗争觉悟，进一步巩固和发展了集体经济，为今年小麦获得丰收，创造了极为有利的条件。
    河南省各级革命委员会遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众”的教导，麦收一开始，就组织很多以宣传门合同志英雄事迹为主要内容的毛泽东思想宣传队，深入到麦收第一线，宣传门合事迹，宣传毛泽东思想。宣传队的同志，以门合为榜样，和社员一起劳动，和革命群众一起狠抓阶级斗争，有力地促进了夏收工作的胜利开展。
