Lao Patriotic Military and Civilians Bravely Fight to Smash Enemy's "Eating Away" Attacks

The patriotic military and civilians of Savannakhet and Saravane provinces annihilated over 300 enemy troops.

The General Command of the People's Liberation Army congratulates the patriotic military and civilians of Khammouane province on their glorious victory of shooting down the 200th American plane.

According to a report from the Xinhua News Agency in Kheang Kai, the Pathet Lao News Agency reported: In late May and early June, the patriotic military and civilians of Savannakhet province bravely smashed the enemy's various "eating away" attacks, annihilating 112 enemy troops.

The report said that on May 23, under the command of American advisors, a large number of right-wing troops invaded the Ban Tiao and Ban Liang areas. The well-prepared military and civilians of Savannakhet province first gave the invading enemy a fierce blow in the Ban Tiao and Batia areas, annihilating 34 enemy troops, including killing one American advisor and two right-wing lieutenants, and seizing 10 weapons and a large amount of ammunition and military supplies.

On May 24, the patriotic military and civilians of this province again bravely intercepted the enemy troops that had just arrived in the Ban Liang and Ban Kong areas, killing 18 enemy troops on the spot and seizing a batch of weapons and military supplies.

After suffering the above two heavy defeats, the enemy hastily retreated to the Na Sa area. On May 31, the military and civilians of Savannakhet province continued their efforts and struck the remnants of the enemy five kilometers away from Na Sa, killing another 15 enemy troops and seizing two heavy machine guns.

On June 3 and 5, the U.S. imperialists and their right-wing puppets launched "eating away" attacks on Phalan County and the 185 Hill in Savannakhet province. The local patriotic military and civilians immediately launched a fierce counterattack, killing 45 enemy troops, wounding many, capturing two, and seizing 43 weapons (including 21 cannons of various calibers) and a batch of military supplies.

Another report said that from May to early June, the local forces and guerrillas of Louang Namtha province struck the enemy in Chalanxay County and south of Namtha City, annihilating 40 enemy troops and seizing a batch of weapons and military supplies.

According to a report from the Xinhua News Agency in Kheang Kai, the Pathet Lao News Agency reported: From May 26 to early June, the patriotic military and civilians of Saravane province bravely counterattacked the enemy's "eating away" attacks, annihilating nearly 250 enemy troops and seizing a large number of weapons, ammunition, and military supplies.

The report said that during the above period, the U.S. imperialists and their Lao puppets dispatched a large right-wing army to launch large-scale "eating away" attacks on the Bakas liberated area and other places 50 kilometers southwest of Saravane City. The highly vigilant patriotic military and civilians of Saravane province immediately gave the invading enemy a fierce blow, achieving the above-mentioned significant results.

The local forces and guerrillas of Saravane province also annihilated a group of parachuted spies in the vicinity of Saravane City on May 25.

The patriotic military and civilians of Sayaboury, Vientiane, and Louang Namtha provinces recently annihilated more than 80 enemy troops in battles, including killing one right-wing colonel of the Lao army.

According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao Radio Station, the General Command of the Lao People's Liberation Army sent a telegram on June 25 to the patriotic military and civilians of Khammouane province, warmly congratulating them on their glorious victory of shooting down the 200th American aggressor plane on June 19.

The telegram said that the victory of the patriotic military and civilians of Khammouane province is a well-deserved punishment for the U.S. imperialists' war plans.

The telegram pointed out that the more the U.S. imperialists and their puppets suffer heavy defeats in military and political terms, the more they will desperately expand the war. Therefore, the patriotic military and civilians of Khammouane province, who have achieved glorious victories, should further heighten their vigilance, strengthen unity, consolidate and carry forward the victories they have achieved, continuously attack the enemy, shoot down and destroy more American planes, annihilate more enemy troops, and win greater new victories.

    据新华社康开电　据巴特寮通讯社报道：老挝沙湾拿吉省爱国军民在五月底和六月初的五天中，英勇地粉碎了敌人的各次“蚕食”进攻，歼敌一百一十二名。
    报道说，五月二十三日，在美国顾问指挥下，大批右派军队侵犯班票和班谅等地区。严阵以待的沙湾拿吉省军民，首先在班票和巴提地区给来犯的敌人以迎头痛击，歼敌三十四名，其中包括打死美国顾问一名、右派尉级军官两名，缴获武器十件和许多弹药及军用物资。
    五月二十四日，这个省的爱国军民又英勇截击刚刚开到班谅和班空地区的敌军，当场打死敌军十八名，缴获武器和军用物资一批。
    敌人在遭到上述两次惨重失败之后，慌忙向纳沙地区撤退。五月三十一日，沙湾拿吉省军民再接再厉，在离纳沙五公里的地方打击残敌，又打死敌人十五名，缴获重机枪两挺。
    六月三日和五日两天，美帝国主义及其走狗右派军队对沙湾拿吉省法兰县和一八五高地发动“蚕食”进攻。当地爱国军民立即予以猛烈反击，一举打死敌人四十五名，打伤多名，俘虏两名，缴获武器四十三件（其中包括各种不同口径的炮二十一门）和一批军用物资。
    另据报道，琅南塔省地方部队和游击队，从五月到六月初期间，在恰仑塞县和南塔市南面打击敌人，共歼敌四十名，缴获一批武器和军用物资。
    新华社康开电　据巴特寮通讯社报道：老挝沙拉湾省爱国军民在五月二十六日到六月初期间，英勇反击敌人的“蚕食”进攻，共消灭敌人近二百五十名，缴获大批武器弹药和军用物资。
    报道说，美帝国主义及其老挝走狗在上述期间派出了一支庞大的右派军队，对沙拉湾省沙拉湾市西南五十公里的巴卡解放区等地发动大规模的“蚕食”进攻。保持高度警惕的沙拉湾省爱国军民当即给予来犯的敌人以迎头痛击，取得了上述重大的战果。
    沙拉湾省地方部队和游击队五月二十五日也在沙拉湾市附近地区，一举全歼了一股空投的间谍。
    沙耶武里、万象和琅南塔省爱国军民，最近期间在战斗中也消灭敌人八十多名，其中包括打死老挝右派军队的中校一名。
    新华社康开二十九日电　据巴特寮电台广播，老挝人民解放军最高指挥部，二十五日打电报给川圹省爱国军民，热烈祝贺他们在六月十九日击落第二百架美国强盗飞机的光辉胜利。
    电报说，川圹省爱国军民的这一胜利，是对美帝国主义战争计划的应有的惩罚。
    电报指出，美帝国主义及其走狗越是在军事上和政治上遭到惨重失败，就越会拚命地扩大战争。因此，取得光辉胜利的川圹省爱国军民，更应提高警惕，加强团结，巩固和发扬已取得的胜利，不断地进攻敌人，击落击毁更多的美国飞机，歼灭敌人更多的有生力量，夺取更大的新胜利。
