Title: Soviet Revisionists Brazenly Indoctrinate Minors with the Idea of the Ruble as the Supreme Authority

The mouthpiece of the Soviet revisionist renegade clique, *Izvestia*, published an article by Ovchinnikova that vigorously advocates for the idea of "making children earn money" as part of the "educational plan," and treating the issue of "youth and money" as a "blank spot" in education that needs to be filled.

The article begins with a misleading question: "Do minors have the right to earn money? Should they contribute to the family income?" The author then advocates that there should be no boundaries between "youth and earning money," and that youth should also "contribute according to their abilities and receive according to their work." In the author's view, anyone who does not educate youth according to this "rule" of the ruble as the supreme authority is being hypocritical and is "depriving" children of their "rights."

The article praises several examples of "youth earning money": how Khashakov from Tula handed over his first wage from a vocational school to his mother, who kissed him and said, "Look, you've become a breadwinner." How the elder son of the construction worker Alexandrovich from Simferopol helped a mason during the summer and proudly sent his mother the first 47 rubles he earned through the post office. And how some boys and girls aged 14 or 15 who worked at the "Progress" company's Luzk branch during the summer holidays were so proud to sign their names on the payroll with the adults.

The article also advocates for the establishment of special agencies under the Komsomol local committees to introduce minors to various enterprises in need of labor. It also urges children to sell flowers and ice cream on the streets during holidays, to trim bushes, or to work as temporary workers, "engaging in real productive labor for adults that is paid in rubles and kopecks." The author even absurdly claims that this method of youth earning money "helps children choose their path and profession."

However, the author apparently believes that this method of earning money is not necessary for the children of the Soviet bourgeois privileged class. Therefore, the author shifts the focus and writes: "The concept of labor should not be simplified," and it should not be "reduced to things associated with physical labor."

To advocate for the so-called "expert path," the article shamelessly states: Some students complete hundreds of math problems during the holidays. Although they cannot immediately receive remuneration, this remuneration is "temporarily deposited in the bank," and after a period, they can receive labor remuneration with a lot of interest.

### 苏修公然向少年学生灌输卢布挂帅思想  《消息报》大肆宣扬“把子女挣钱”列入“教育计划”

    苏修公然向少年学生灌输卢布挂帅思想
    《消息报》大肆宣扬“把子女挣钱”列入“教育计划”
    本报讯　苏修叛徒集团的喉舌《消息报》发表奥夫钦尼科娃写的一篇文章，竭力宣扬要“把子女的挣钱看成一种教育计划”，“把‘少年和钱’的问题”作为“教育方面的一个空白点”来填补。
    这篇文章劈头就提出一个蛊惑人心的问题：“少年学生有没有挣钱的权利？他应该不应该为家庭收入作出自己的贡献？”接着，作者鼓吹说：在“挣钱”方面，“童年和少年，少年同成年之间”是不应该有界限的；少年也必须“各尽所能，按劳分配”。在作者看来，谁不按照这种卢布挂帅的“法规”教育少年，谁就是“假仁假义”，就是在“剥夺”孩子的“权利”。
    文章以赞美的笔调描写了“少年挣钱”的几个例子：图拉市地方的哈沙柯夫如何把在艺徒学校第一次得来的工资交给母亲，母亲对他说：“瞅，你成了能养家的人了，让我吻一吻你。”辛菲罗波尔市施工员阿列克山德罗维奇的大儿子夏天如何到农场“给泥水匠帮忙”，又是“多么自豪地通过邮局给他母亲寄去了他第一次挣来的四十七个卢布”。而每年暑假在“进步”公司卢兹克分公司劳动的“一些十四五岁的男孩和小姑娘”，“同大人们一起在工资单上签字时又是多么自豪啊”。
    文章还鼓吹在“共青团”地方委员会附设专门机构，以便为需要劳动力的各种企业介绍少年学生。同时鼓动儿童假期到大街上去“卖花和冰淇淋”，去“修剪灌木”，或者去当“临时工”，“从事以卢布和戈比计价的真正生产性的成年人的劳动”。作者竟然胡说什么，这种少年挣钱的办法“有助于孩子选择道路和职业”。
    但是，作者显然认为这种挣钱的办法对于苏联资产阶级特权阶层的孩子是不必要的，因此，他的笔锋一转，又写道：“不应该把劳动这个概念简单化”，不应该“只是把它归结为同体力劳动相联系的事情”。
    为了鼓吹所谓“专家道路”，文章竟然无耻地说：有的学生在假期完成数百道数学习题，虽然不能马上得到报酬，但这种报酬“暂时是在银行里放着，过一个时期，就可能拿到加上不少利息的劳动报酬了”。
