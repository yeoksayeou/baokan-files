Three hundred thousand urban youth in Shandong make contributions in the countryside

According to Xinhua News Agency in Jinan, the three hundred thousand urban youth who have settled down in the vast rural areas of Shandong for a long time, following the direction indicated by the great leader Chairman Mao, firmly walk the path of combining with poor and lower-middle peasants. They take poor and lower-middle peasants as their teachers and play a significant role in the three great revolutionary movements in the countryside, gaining tempering and improvement.

Most of these urban youth who have settled down in the Yimeng Mountain area, the Yellow River banks, the Jiaodong Peninsula, and the Luxi Plain since 1962 are organized to go to the countryside. They are mostly born in the new society and grew up under the red flag, having not suffered the hardships of the old society. After arriving in the countryside, their first lesson is to receive class education. In the revolutionary base areas of Shandong, such as the Yimeng Mountain area and the Jiaodong Peninsula, many former village cadres and old militia members enthusiastically tell the youth about the village history and the revolutionary struggle history of the region, making the youth understand how the Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, endured countless hardships and fought bravely to overthrow the reactionary rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang and gain liberation.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao, these youth raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fought alongside the poor and lower-middle peasants, and launched a fierce attack on the class enemy. In Pingdu, Changyi, Yinan, and other places, many youth wrote the first big-character posters in the village to attack the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. In the struggle to criticize China's Khrushchev and other handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and their agents, the youth played to their strengths, drawing cartoons, creating blackboard newspapers, setting up special columns for criticism, and holding criticism meetings with the poor and lower-middle peasants, effectively promoting the sustained and in-depth development of the revolutionary criticism.

The youth who went to the countryside took the poor and lower-middle peasants as their examples, loved Chairman Mao infinitely, and loved Mao Zedong Thought infinitely. They diligently studied Chairman Mao's works, taking Chairman Mao's brilliant work "The Direction of the Youth Movement" as their motto, urging themselves to always combine with the poor and lower-middle peasants.

At the end of 1966, when the youth were united with the poor and lower-middle peasants to launch a fierce attack on the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, a handful of capitalist roaders colluded with untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in society to stir up a counter-revolutionary wind of "returning to the city" among the youth going up to the mountains and down to the countryside. However, the vast majority of the youth going up to the mountains and down to the countryside in the province remembered Chairman Mao's teaching: "How do we judge whether a young person is revolutionary or not? What standard do we use to judge him? There is only one standard, that is, whether he is willing to and actually combines with the broad masses of workers and peasants." They decided not to leave the countryside, not to leave the production post, and not to leave the poor and lower-middle peasants. They united and fought with the poor and lower-middle peasants, thoroughly exposing and criticizing China's Khrushchev and his agents in Shandong for their heinous crimes of sabotaging the work of sending youth up to the mountains and down to the countryside, finally repelling the class enemy's arrogant attack. Some youth who returned to the city due to deception also quickly returned to the production post.

These youth going up to the mountains and down to the countryside enthusiastically propagated Mao Zedong Thought in the countryside. They read Chairman Mao's "Sixteen Points" personally drafted and promulgated by Chairman Mao in the fields, on the land, on the kang, after work, and after meals to the poor and lower-middle peasants; timely conveyed Chairman Mao's latest instructions; taught community members to sing revolutionary songs praising the great leader Chairman Mao; and enthusiastically helped the poor and lower-middle peasants hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes. In places where youth have settled down, there are mostly revolutionary scenes of "villages full of quotations and hills full of songs."

Chairman Mao taught us: "Youth is the most active and vigorous part of the entire social force." The youth going up to the mountains and down to the countryside in Shandong are also a shock force in production struggles. They braved difficulties to settle down in saline-alkali waterlogged areas, actively fought alongside the poor and lower-middle peasants in the battle to change heaven and earth, and were called the "revolutionary hard-bone team," "iron girl team," and "heroic shock workers" by the poor and lower-middle peasants. They carried out scientific experiments, spread advanced experiences, promoted excellent technologies, and many took on the roles of technicians, electricians, and machine operators.

    沿着毛主席指引的方向  走与贫下中农相结合的道路
    山东三万名知识青年在农村作出贡献
    据新华社济南电　在山东广大农村长期安家落户的三万名城市知识青年，沿着伟大领袖毛主席指引的方向，坚定不移地走与贫下中农相结合的道路，拜贫下中农为师，在农村三大革命运动中发挥了很大作用，得到了锻炼和提高。
    这批在沂蒙山区、黄河两岸、胶东半岛、鲁西平原安家落户的城市知识青年，绝大部分是一九六二年以来有组织地到农村去的。他们大都是生在新社会，长在红旗下，没有受过旧社会的苦。他们到农村以后，第一堂课就是接受阶级教育。在山东革命老根据地沂蒙山区和胶东半岛，许多当年的村干部、老民兵热情地给青年们讲村史和本地区的革命斗争史，使知识青年了解我国人民在毛主席领导下，经历了怎样的千辛万苦和英勇斗争，才推翻了帝国主义和国民党反动派的反动统治，获得了翻身解放。
    在毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命中，这批知识青年高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同贫下中农一起，冲锋陷阵，向阶级敌人开展了猛烈进攻。在平度、昌邑、沂南等地，不少知识青年跟贫下中农一起，写出全村第一张炮轰党内一小撮走资派的革命大字报。在向中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派及其代理人展开革命大批判的斗争中，知识青年发挥他们的特长，画漫画，出黑板报，建立大批判专栏，与贫下中农一起举行批判会，有力地推动了革命大批判持久深入地开展。
    下乡落户的知识青年以贫下中农为榜样，无限热爱毛主席，无限热爱毛泽东思想，勤奋地学习毛主席著作。他们把毛主席的光辉著作《青年运动的方向》作为座右铭，鞭策自己永远同贫下中农结合在一起。
    一九六六年年底，正当知识青年同贫下中农团结战斗，向党内一小撮走资派发起猛烈进攻的时刻，一小撮走资派伙同社会上的没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，在上山下乡的知识青年中煽起一股“回流城市”的反革命妖风。但是，全省绝大多数上山下乡知识青年牢记毛主席的教导：“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。”他们下决心不离开农村，不离开生产岗位，不离开贫下中农。他们同贫下中农团结战斗，彻底揭发批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其在山东的代理人破坏知识青年上山下乡工作的滔天罪行，终于打退了阶级敌人的猖狂进攻。一部分因受蒙蔽而回流城市的知识青年，也都迅速返回生产岗位。
    这批上山下乡知识青年在农村热情宣传毛泽东思想。他们在田边、地头、炕头，工余、饭后，向贫下中农宣读毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”；及时传达毛主席的最新指示；教社员高唱歌颂伟大领袖毛主席的革命歌曲；还热情帮助贫下中农举办毛泽东思想学习班。在有知识青年安家落户的地方，大都出现了“满村语录满坡歌”的革命景象。
    毛主席教导我们说：“青年是整个社会力量中的一部分最积极最有生气的力量。”山东省上山下乡的知识青年，在生产斗争中也是一支突击力量。他们在盐碱涝洼地区，顶着困难安家，积极地同贫下中农一道投入改天换地的战斗，被贫下中农称为“革命硬骨头队”、“铁姑娘队”、“英雄突击手”。他们大搞科学实验，传播先进经验，推广优良技术，不少人担任了技术员、电工和机械手。
