The joyous news of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao receiving the representatives of the coal mine conference on revolution and production has greatly inspired the revolutionary cadres and broad masses of workers in the Zaozhuang coal mining area of Shandong. A new high tide of seizing the revolution and promoting production is surging forward in the Zaozhuang mining area. Building on the achievement of overfulfilling the production plan every month from January to April, the entire mining area has once again overfulfilled the coal mining and tunneling plans for May by six days ahead of schedule, setting a new record for the highest monthly output in the mining area. This is a victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The news of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin receiving the revolutionary worker representatives of the coal mine conference on revolution and production has invigorated the revolutionary cadres and workers and their families in the Zaozhuang mining area. They are brimming with spirit, full of revolutionary fervor, and bursting with enthusiasm. With the strongest proletarian feelings, they are determined to achieve even more outstanding results in seizing the revolution and promoting production to report to Chairman Mao. The revolutionary workers of coal mines such as Ganlin, Tiantun, and Weizhuang have been steadfast in their underground work to ensure production and, upon returning to the surface, have been deeply engaged in revolutionary criticism. The more they criticize, the more they hate the Chinese Khrushchev, the more they love our great leader Chairman Mao, and the greater their enthusiasm for production. These mines have all overfulfilled the coal mining and tunneling plans for May by seven to eight days ahead of schedule.

Currently, the revolutionary workers of the Zaozhuang mining area are further implementing Chairman Mao's great directive of "seizing the revolution and promoting production," pressing forward to victory.

The broad revolutionary masses of workers in the Shuangyashan mining area, under the great inspiration of the joyous news of our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao receiving the representatives of the coal mine conference on revolution and production, have greatly increased their revolutionary enthusiasm. In recent days, this important coal production base in Heilongjiang Province has continuously reported heartening new production records. A tide of seizing the revolution and promoting production is surging forward throughout the mine. Building on the achievement of overfulfilling the state production plans for January to April, the broad revolutionary masses of workers have once again overfulfilled the production plan for May by six days ahead of schedule. This is a victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

On May 25, the broad revolutionary masses of workers in the Shuangyashan mining area gathered before Chairman Mao's portrait to take an oath, vowing to seize the revolution and vigorously promote production, to fight a good battle for coal, and to report to Chairman Mao with excellent results. The broad revolutionary miners said, "Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts, and we are the red miners of Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao personally receiving our coal mine revolutionary worker representatives is the greatest care, the greatest inspiration, and the greatest encouragement for us!" On that day, the daily output of the four coal mines in the entire mining area all increased severalfold. Among them, the output of Lingdong and Lingxi, which account for 60% of the total coal production in the area, both doubled, setting a new record since the mine's establishment.
