"The Voice of the Thai People" radio station broadcasted an article titled "Long Live the Thai People's Armed Struggle!" on the 20th, enthusiastically hailing the rapid development and growth of the Thai people's revolutionary armed struggle under the leadership of the Thai Communist Party. The article calls on the Thai people to carry the people's war through to the end.

The article states that the Thai people's revolutionary armed struggle, led by the Thai Communist Party, has achieved brilliant victories in more than two years. The flames of armed struggle have spread to 30 out of the 71 provinces in Thailand. The people's armed forces have repeatedly crushed the counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" campaigns of the US-Thanon group and have continued to grow stronger in the battles. Reports indicate that in more than two years, the people's armed forces have engaged in 780 battles with the enemy, annihilating more than 2,200 enemy soldiers and seizing a large amount of weapons and ammunition.

The article points out that the Thai people's revolutionary armed struggle has brought about earth-shaking changes in the Thai countryside. The vast majority of the peasantry have united and taken up arms to bravely fight against the reactionary rulers. The armed struggle has made the Thai revolution advance by leaps and bounds and has sounded the death knell for the US-Thanon group.

The article states that more than two years of armed struggle have made the Thai people deeply realize that without armed struggle, there is no position for the people, and there is no victory for the revolution. Without the people's armed forces, there is nothing for the people, and it is impossible to drive out the American aggressors and overthrow the Thanom-Prapas traitorous clique.

The article points out that the US-Thanon group is unwilling to admit defeat. They have become even more frantic in their suppression of the people's armed forces. Since they cannot extinguish the flames of revolution, they have turned to political deception and are playing a counter-revolutionary two-handed game. The spokesperson for the Thai Communist Party has timely exposed the political plots of the US-Thanon group, pointed out the correct path of revolution to the people, and called on the Thai people to resolutely carry out the people's war and smash the political deception of the US-Thanon group.

The article states that the declaration of the Thai Communist Party spokesperson has dealt a heavy blow to the US-Thai reactionaries, enabling the Thai people to see through the enemy's tricks and schemes, and to recognize the fascist nature of the US-Thanon group's rule. Thus, they persist in the revolutionary armed struggle and smash the enemy's illusions of deceiving the people with a fake constitution.

The article states that the patriotic struggle of the Thai people is not isolated. The revolutionary people of the world stand on our side, supporting our revolutionary struggle, especially the 700 million Chinese people armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, who stand on our side and fully support our revolutionary struggle. The US imperialists and their running dogs are facing increasingly fierce attacks from the revolutionary people of various countries, and their doom is approaching.

The article concludes by emphasizing that in this favorable situation for the people, as long as we persist in the revolutionary armed struggle and resolutely carry the people's war through to the end, no matter how frantically the US-Thanon group carries out military suppression and political deception, they will not be able to save themselves from failure. In the end, victory will definitely belong to the Thai people.

    “泰国人民之声”欢呼泰共领导的人民武装斗争迅速发展壮大
    号召泰国人民把人民战争进行到底
    坚决粉碎美国—他侬集团妄图用伪宪法来欺骗人民的政治大骗局
    新华社二十一日讯“泰国人民之声”电台二十日广播一篇题为《泰国人民武装斗争万岁！》的文章，热烈欢呼泰国共产党领导下的泰国人民革命武装斗争迅速发展壮大，并号召泰国人民把人民战争进行到底。
    文章说，泰国共产党领导的泰国人民革命武装斗争，两年多来取得了辉煌的胜利。武装斗争烈火已蔓延到全国七十一个府中的三十个府，人民武装一次又一次地粉碎了美国—他侬集团的反革命“围剿”，并在战斗中不断发展壮大。据报道，两年多来，人民武装同敌人战斗了七百八十多次，共歼灭敌人二千二百多名，缴获敌人大批武器弹药。
    文章指出，泰国人民革命武装斗争，使泰国农村起了翻天覆地的变化，广大农村的农民群众广泛团结起来，拿起武器同反动统治者进行英勇的斗争。革命武装斗争使泰国革命大踏步前进，同时敲响了美国—他侬集团的丧钟。
    文章说，两年多来的武装斗争，使泰国人民深深地体会到：离开了武装斗争，就没有人民的地位，就没有革命的胜利。没有人民武装，就没有人民的一切，就不可能驱逐美国侵略者，推翻他侬—巴博卖国集团。
    文章指出，美国—他侬集团是不甘心失败的，它们更加疯狂地镇压人民武装，由于它们无法扑灭革命的烈火，就转而进行政治欺骗，玩弄反革命两手。泰国共产党发言人及时地揭露了美国—他侬集团的政治阴谋，给人民指出了革命的正确道路，号召泰国人民坚决进行人民战争，粉碎美国—他侬集团的政治大骗局。
    文章说，泰共发言人的声明，沉重地打击了美泰反动派，使泰国人民识破了敌人的阴谋诡计，看穿了美国—他侬集团的法西斯专政本质，从而坚持革命武装斗争，粉碎敌人妄图以伪宪法来欺骗人民的美梦。
    文章说，泰国人民的爱国斗争并不是孤立的，全世界革命人民站在我们一边，支持我们的革命斗争，特别是用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民站在我们一边，全力支持我们的革命斗争。美帝国主义及其走狗正遭到各国革命人民越来越猛烈的进攻，它们的末日越来越近了。
    文章最后强调指出，在这有利于人民的大好形势下，只要我们坚持革命武装斗争，坚决把人民战争进行到底，不管美国—他侬集团进行怎样疯狂的武力镇压和政治欺骗，都无法挽救它们的失败，最后胜利一定属于泰国人民。
