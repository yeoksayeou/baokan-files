In the friendly country of Tanzania in East Africa, Chinese overseas engineering and technical personnel and medical staff have developed a close and sincere friendship with the Tanzanian people through friendly interactions and genuine cooperation. Chinese technical personnel and medical staff regard their work in Tanzania as their internationalist duty, and they consider the Tanzanian people as their own family; the Tanzanian people affectionately call the Chinese personnel "our Chinese brothers," "the best friends of the African people," and "good experts sent by Chairman Mao."

Building Friendship Through Labor

In the western suburbs of Dar es Salaam, the first state-owned textile enterprise in Tanzania, the Tanzania Friendship Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory, has been completed through the hard work of Chinese engineering and technical personnel and Tanzanian workers over the past two years. Now, when you enter the factory, you can see Tanzanian workers skillfully operating hundreds of various machines. The hardworking Tanzanian people see with their own eyes how the cotton produced in their own country is spun into yarn, woven into cloth, and dyed with vibrant colors and beautiful patterns by their own workers in this factory, and they cannot help but feel a deep sense of joy. They are proud of the achievements they have made on the road to self-reliance and are also deeply grateful for the sincere assistance of their Chinese brothers.

This area was once a wild field overgrown with weeds. From the start of construction to the trial production, Tanzanian workers responded to President Nyerere's call for self-reliance in building the country, worked hard, and quickly improved their technical skills. Thousands of Tanzanian technical workers have rapidly grown. They work side by side with Chinese engineering and technical personnel, forging a close friendship.

A Chinese worker, Zhao Zhensheng, who worked in this factory, had his left arm severely injured while repairing a machine in mid-October 1966. After undergoing an amputation surgery, he was left with only one arm but insisted on staying in Tanzania to work until recently when his mission was completed before returning home. When people saw this one-armed Chinese worker, covered in mud and oil, working busily with Tanzanian workers, they were deeply moved. A Tanzanian worker said, "Chinese experts are our true friends. You are truly helping us build. In your daily work, you labor with us and become one of us. Even after being injured and losing an arm, you stay here to continue serving us. Your spirit is truly moving to us." A Tanzanian medical staff member who had treated Zhao Zhensheng's injury said, "I have treated many injured patients, but I have never seen anyone as brave and steadfast as him. In the short time we spent together, I learned many valuable things from him. To have such a good friend is truly a blessing in my life."

The Chinese technical personnel working in this factory teach Tanzanian youth technology very seriously and responsibly. A young Tanzanian worker was deeply moved and said, "Only from the good engineering and technical personnel sent by Mao Zedong can we truly learn technology." Another worker said, "Every time I see Chinese engineering and technical personnel on the construction site, covered in mud and working with us, selflessly imparting technology, I think: Tanzania has found its best friends."

Recently, when Tanzanian workers learned that the Chinese personnel they had been with day and night would gradually return to China in batches, they were reluctant to part. Some invited Chinese personnel to their homes, some brought their family members to say goodbye to the Chinese personnel, and some took photos with the Chinese personnel to keep as mementos. They repeatedly reminded the Chinese personnel: When you return to Beijing, be sure to convey the warm greetings and sincere gratitude of the African workers to Chairman Mao.

Martyrs Live in the Hearts of the People

Tanzanian friends have always remembered the Chinese water engineer Zhang Mincai, who died in the line of duty in Tanzania. At his grave, Tanzanian people often come to pay their respects. The Chinese personnel working in Tanzania have not forgotten: four days and four nights before Zhang Mincai's death, the Tanzanian government and medical staff showed great concern and rescue efforts for this Chinese water engineer, as well as the long procession of Tanzanian people who came to bury Zhang Mincai.

On October 4 last year, when Zhang Mincai, who was helping Tanzania design the Kidunda Dam project, was severely stung by poisonous bees during work, both Chinese and Tanzanian doctors and workers worked closely together, forgetting sleep and rest, and conducted rescue efforts for four days and four nights to save his life. During the rescue, the Tanzanian government's Ministry of Health and the hospital provided all possible medical equipment and medicines. Many Tanzanian doctors, nurses, and patients in the hospital were deeply moved when they knew he was injured while working for Tanzania's construction and closely followed his condition, doing their best to save him.

When Zhang Mincai died from severe poisoning on October 8, Mosas, the Tanzanian representative of the Kidunda Dam project, immediately rushed from the construction site over 400 miles away to attend the funeral. On the day of the funeral, a long procession of mourners passed through the streets of Dar es Salaam, including Tanzanian government ministers and many Tanzanian friends who were not previously acquainted. They often mentioned Zhang Mincai when they talked about him later, saying that the engineering and technical personnel sent by Chairman Mao are the best friends of the African people. What particularly moved them was that Zhang Mincai's ashes were buried in a local African public cemetery. They regarded this as a symbol of the deep friendship between the two countries.

After Zhang Mincai died from bee stings, Tanzanian friends were even more concerned about the safety of Chinese workers, and many touching incidents occurred.

One day, several Chinese engineering and technical personnel came to a coconut grove to survey the terrain for an upcoming project. An unknown Tanzanian farmer was lingering near a mango tree. Initially, due to the language barrier, the Chinese personnel did not understand why the farmer was standing there. Later, they found out that there was a large beehive on the tree, and the farmer was afraid that the Chinese friends would be stung by bees and poisoned, so he stood there, gesturing to every passing Chinese personnel not to approach. Under the care of this stranger, the Chinese personnel working in the grove safely avoided the large beehive and successfully completed the survey.

The Tanzanian people have deep affection for the engineering and technical personnel from China, treating them like family, providing them with meticulous care and help. Once, the car carrying Chinese personnel broke down late at night on the road, and passing Tanzanian people voluntarily got out to help repair it; once, a Chinese personnel was caught in a heavy rain while working in the fields, and an African elderly woman braved the rain to bring him an umbrella; not long ago, a Chinese personnel lost a plastic net bag containing tools, and an elderly farmer found it by the roadside and personally returned it the next morning. Similar heartwarming stories often occur in Tanzania.

"You Are Like Family"

Hamisi, a farmer from Pemba Island, suffered from severe tuberculosis, with his left lung completely destroyed, and often coughed up blood and was bedridden. He had been ill for eight years, his body very weak, and finally decided to have Chinese doctors perform a lung resection surgery. Chinese doctors care deeply about the health of Tanzanian workers and are determined to overcome all difficulties to perform a left lung resection surgery for this African farmer. The lung resection surgery required a large amount of blood transfusion. Although the hospital actively tried to collect 2,000 cc of blood, it was still not enough. At that time, the leader of the Chinese medical team assisting the Chinese surgeon in the operating room had the same blood type as Hamisi and immediately donated 400 cc of blood, thus enabling Hamisi to successfully undergo the surgery.

Under the careful care of Chinese and Zanzibar medical personnel, Hamisi's health quickly recovered. Hamisi was very grateful to the Chinese doctors and said, "Chinese doctors saved me from the brink of death. I still have Chinese doctors' blood in my body. I and my entire family will never forget the familial care of Chinese doctors for African people."

More than two years ago, a woman named Fatuma in Zanzibar had her seventh child in the hospital. A European doctor who assisted in the delivery brutally broke the baby's arm. Two days later, this doctor discharged Fatuma. The Chinese midwife working in the obstetrics department was very careful in her care. She noticed from the baby's constant crying that the baby's arm was broken and kept the baby in the hospital for treatment by a Chinese orthopedic doctor. When Fatuma's baby was discharged from the hospital, she held the Chinese midwife's hand and reluctantly said, "Without the careful treatment of Chinese doctors, my daughter would have been disabled for life. You treat us African people like family."

To express her gratitude to the Chinese medical personnel, she named her daughter "Friendship." Now "Friendship" is almost three years old and is growing up healthily. Fatuma often brings "Friendship" to visit the Chinese doctors.

Long Live Tanzanian-Chinese Friendship!

On the outskirts of Zanzibar City, at the construction site of the national stadium built with Chinese aid in Shebeleni, there is a 22-meter-high wooden frame with a red banner written in both Chinese and Swahili: "Long Live the Friendship Between the People of China and Tanzania!" This banner was jointly made by the Chinese engineering and technical personnel and Tanzanian workers on the construction site. They cherish the friendship between the two countries, so they carefully made this banner. When they climbed up the high wooden frame and nailed the banner, the Chinese and Tanzanian personnel working on the construction site all applauded and cheered, congratulating each other. Some African workers even waved their tools excitedly and shouted, "Long Live the Friendship Between Tanzania and China!"

Everyone who passes by this construction site looks at the banner with approval. They believe that the banner expresses the common wishes of the two countries' people.

    “非洲人民最好的朋友”
    ——记中国援外工程技术人员和坦桑尼亚人民的友谊
    在东非的友好之邦坦桑尼亚联合共和国，中国援外工程技术人员和医务人员，在同坦桑尼亚人民友好相处和真诚合作中，结成了亲密无间的友谊。中国技术人员和医务人员把在坦桑尼亚的工作看成是自己应尽的国际主义义务，把坦桑尼亚人民看成是自己的亲人；坦桑尼亚人民也亲切地称呼中国人员为“我们的中国兄弟”、“非洲人民最好的朋友”、“毛主席派来的好专家”。
    在劳动中建立友谊
    在达累斯萨拉姆西郊的乌邦果，坦桑尼亚的第一个国营纺织企业——坦桑尼亚友谊纺织印染厂，经过中国工程技术人员同坦桑尼亚工人两年来的辛勤劳动，已经全部建成。现在，走进这个工厂，就可以看见坦桑尼亚工人正熟练地操作着数百台各种机器。勤劳的坦桑尼亚人民亲眼看到自己国家出产的棉花，在这个工厂里由自己的工人纺成纱，织成布，印染上鲜艳的色彩和美丽的图案，无不感到衷心的喜悦。他们为自己在自力更生的道路上取得的成绩感到骄傲，同时也由衷地感激中国兄弟的真诚援助。
    这个地区过去是杂草丛生的一片野地。从开始建厂到试产的过程中，坦桑尼亚工人响应尼雷尔总统自力更生建设国家的号召，奋发图强，努力学习，技术水平迅速得到提高。上千名坦桑尼亚技术工人迅速地成长起来了。他们同中国工程技术人员并肩劳动，结成了亲密的友谊。
    在这个厂工作的中国工人赵振声同志，一九六六年十月中旬在抢修机器时，左臂受到重伤，经过截肢手术后，只剩下一只手，仍坚持留在坦桑尼亚工作，直到最近完成任务才回国。当人们看到这位独臂的中国工人，满身泥浆油污，同坦桑尼亚工人一起忙碌地劳动时，无不为之感动。一位坦桑尼亚工人说：“中国专家是我们真正的朋友。”“你们真正为了帮助我们建设。平时你们和我们共同劳动，打成一片，负了伤失去一只手还留在这里继续为我们服务。你们这种精神太使我们感动了。”一位给赵振声同志治过伤的坦桑尼亚医务人员说：“我医治过很多受伤的病人，但从来没有见过象他这样勇敢坚毅的人。在我们短短相处的日子里，我从他那里学到许多有益的东西。我能交上这样好的朋友真是一生中的幸运。”
    在这个厂里工作的中国技术人员教坦桑尼亚青年学技术，很认真负责。一位坦桑尼亚青年工人很感动地说：“只有从毛泽东派来的好工程技术人员那里，我们才能真正学到技术。”另一位工人说：“我一看见中国工程技术人员在工地上满身泥浆同我们一起劳动，无私地传授技术，我就想到：坦桑尼亚找到了最好的朋友。”
    最近，当坦桑尼亚工人得知同他们朝夕相处的中国人员要陆续分批回国的时候，都依依不舍。有的邀请中国人员到家里去作客，有的把自己的亲人带来同中国人员告别，有的同中国人员合影留念。他们一再叮咛中国人员：回到北京后，一定要把非洲工人的热烈问候和诚挚谢意，带给毛主席。
    烈士活在人民心里
    坦桑尼亚朋友一直怀念着因公在坦桑尼亚牺牲的中国水利工程师张敏才烈士，在他的墓前，常有坦桑尼亚人民前去悼念。在坦桑尼亚工作的中国人员也没有忘记：在张敏才烈士去世前的四天四夜里，坦桑尼亚政府和医务人员对这位中国水利工程师的关怀和抢救，以及后来坦桑尼亚人民为张敏才烈士送葬的长长的行列。
    去年十月四日，当帮助坦桑尼亚设计克洞达水库工程的张敏才同志在工作时被毒蜂严重螫伤后，为了挽救他的生命，坦中两国医生和工作人员密切配合，废寝忘食，连续进行了四天四夜的抢救。在抢救期间，坦桑尼亚政府卫生部和医院提供了一切可能提供的医疗设备和药物。医院里的许多坦桑尼亚医生、护士和病人知道他是为坦桑尼亚的建设而负伤时十分感动，都密切关心他的病情，竭尽全力进行抢救。
    当张敏才同志终因中毒过重，医治无效，不幸于十月八日逝世后，克洞达水库工程坦方代表莫萨斯立即从四百多里外的工地赶来送葬。在送葬的那天，长长的送葬人群通过达累斯萨拉姆的街道，其中有坦桑尼亚政府的部长，也有许多素不相识的坦桑尼亚朋友。他们后来在谈到张敏才烈士时还经常说，毛主席派来的中国工程技术人员是非洲人民最好的朋友。特别使他们感动的是，张敏才烈士的骨灰被葬在当地非洲人的公墓。他们把这件事看成是坦中两国人民深厚友谊的象征。
    在张敏才同志被蜂螫中毒牺牲后，坦桑尼亚朋友对中国工作人员的安全更是关心，接连发生了许多令人感动的事。
    一天，几名中国工程技术人员来到一片椰树林，为即将兴建的一项工程测量地形。一位不相识的坦桑尼亚农民正在一颗芒果树附近徘徊。起初，由于语言上的障碍，中国人员不了解这位农民为什么守在那棵树旁。后来才知道，树上有个大蜂窝，他怕中国朋友被蜂螫中毒，所以守在那里，向过往的每一个中国人员打手势，要他们不要靠近。在这位陌生的农民的照顾下，在树林里工作的中国人员都安全地绕过了大蜂窝，顺利地完成了测量任务。
    坦桑尼亚人民对来自中国的工程技术人员怀着深情厚谊，真是象对待亲人一样，给予无微不至的爱护和帮助。一次，中国人员坐的车子深夜在路上抛了锚，过路的坦桑尼亚人主动下车帮助修理；一次，有位中国人员在田间劳动时碰上了大雨，有位非洲老大娘冒雨给送来了雨伞；不久前，一个中国人员丢了个装用具的塑料网袋，一位老农民在路旁拾到了，第二天一早就亲自送了回来。同样的激动人心的故事，在坦桑尼亚是经常发生的。
    “你们象亲人一样”
    奔巴岛农民哈密西患严重肺结核，左肺全部毁损，经常咯血卧床不起。他病了八年，身体很虚弱，最后决定请中国医生作肺切除手术。中国医生非常关怀坦桑尼亚劳动人民的健康，决心克服一切困难为这位非洲农民兄弟作左侧全肺切除的大手术。肺切除手术需要大量输血。虽经院方积极设法筹集了两千西西血，但仍不足需要。当时在手术室协助中国外科医生作手术的中国医疗队队长，同哈密西血型相同，立即献血四百西西，从而使哈密西顺利地通过手术。
    在中国和桑给巴尔医务人员细心护理下，哈密西身体迅速恢复健康。哈密西十分感激中国医生，他说：“中国医生使我从生命垂危中恢复了健康。我身上还流着中国医生的鲜血。我和我们全家永远忘不了中国医生对非洲人民的亲人般的关怀。”
    两年多以前，桑给巴尔一位妇女法图玛在医院生第七个孩子的时候，一个给她接生的欧洲医生竟粗暴地把婴儿的手臂肱骨拉断了。两天后，这个医生还把法图玛打发出院。在妇产科工作的中国助产士护理细心，她从婴儿整日啼哭现象，发现了婴儿手臂的肱骨被折断，便把婴儿留在医院，由中国骨科医生治疗。法图玛在婴儿痊愈出院时，拉着中国助产士的手依依不舍地说：“没有中国医生的细心治疗，我的女儿将会终身残废。你们对我们非洲人民就象亲人一样。”
    为了表示对中国医务人员的谢意，她给女儿取名为“友谊”。现在“友谊”已经快三岁了，正在健康地成长。法图玛还常常带着“友谊”来看望中国医生。
    坦中友谊万岁！
    在桑给巴尔市郊的舍布勒尼，由中国援建的国家体育场工地上，有一座二十二米高的木架，上面挂着一幅中文和斯瓦希利文写的红字标语：“中国—坦桑尼亚人民友谊万岁！”这幅标语是工地上的中国工程技术人员和坦桑尼亚工人共同制作的。他们十分珍视两国人民的友谊，所以精心制作了这幅标语。当他们爬上高高的木架，把标语牌钉上去的时候，在工地上劳动的中国和坦桑尼亚人员都鼓掌欢呼，相互祝贺。有的非洲工人还挥动工具激动地高呼：“坦桑尼亚—中国友谊万岁！”
    所有经过这个工地的人们都对这幅标语投以赞许的目光。他们认为，这幅标语表达了两国人民共同的心愿。
