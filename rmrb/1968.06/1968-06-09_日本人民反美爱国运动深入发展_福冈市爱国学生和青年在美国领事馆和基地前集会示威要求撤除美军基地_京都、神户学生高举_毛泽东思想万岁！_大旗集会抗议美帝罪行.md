The patriotic anti-American movement of the Japanese people is deepening. Students and youth in Fukuoka City gathered in front of the U.S. Consulate and base to demand the withdrawal of U.S. military bases.

Students in Kyoto and Kobe held rallies, waving banners that read "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought!" to protest against the crimes of U.S. imperialism.

According to a report from the East Asia News Agency on June 8, the anti-American patriotic movement of the Japanese people, protesting against the crash of a U.S. military aircraft that burned down a building at Kyushu University, is deepening.

The anti-American movement in Fukuoka City is growing stronger every day. On June 7, from morning to evening, patriotic students and youth continuously gathered in front of the U.S. Consulate and the U.S. Payahu Air Base to hold protest rallies and demonstrations.

On this day, 4,000 students at Kyushu University went on strike and held rallies at the main campus and branch campuses, demanding the withdrawal of the Payahu Base. Subsequently, the students, holding red flags and singing the "Internationale," marched to the U.S. Consulate to protest. The reactionary Sato government dispatched several hundred armed police and many armored vehicles to suppress the demonstrators. However, the students, undeterred by the police, held a rally in front of the U.S. Consulate and repeatedly shouted, "Withdraw the Payahu Base!" "Smash the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty'!" "Oppose the Vietnam War!" "Down with the Sato government!"

After the patriotic students held a protest rally in front of the U.S. Consulate, they marched through the city. When the march passed through the streets, tens of thousands of citizens enthusiastically applauded, expressing their support for the patriotic actions of the students.

Members of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox) Fukuoka Prefecture Branch also deployed a broadcast propaganda car, calling on the Japanese people to take further action to abolish the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

The anti-American struggle of patriotic students in front of the U.S. Payahu Base was even more intense. Reactionary police used barricades to block all roads leading to the base and used armored vehicles, water cannons, and fully armed police forces to brutally suppress the students' patriotic and just struggle. However, 1,500 brave students, youth, and members of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox) broke through numerous obstacles and reached the base gate, engaging in a four-hour struggle. They repeatedly charged the base and threw stones vigorously, demonstrating the fearless spirit of the Japanese people in their struggle.

Near the auxiliary runway north of the base, 3,500 students held a protest rally. Some students also broke through the police blockade and rushed into the base, bravely throwing stones at the U.S. military buildings. Many citizens who came to the Payahu Base with the demonstration team also threw stones at the base and fought alongside the students.

In the struggle at the base gate, more than 100 people were injured by reactionary police, and 10 were arrested. However, bloody suppression could not make the patriotic students give up their struggle. The struggle continued until 9 p.m.

On the same afternoon, 3,000 university student representatives from Kyoto, Osaka, Hyogo, Nara, Wakayama, and Shiga held a meeting at Doshisha University in Kyoto City to support the anti-American struggle of workers, students, and citizens in Fukuoka City and to demand the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." They also enthusiastically praised the anti-American national liberation war of the Vietnamese people and condemned the "peace talks" plot jointly planned by U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism.

They also highly praised the anti-violence struggle of black people in the United States, the struggle of students and workers in France and other European countries, and condemned the betrayal of the revolutionary cause of the people by the revisionist elements in France, Italy, and other countries.

They pointed out that the Miyamoto revisionist group of the Japanese Communist Party is a running dog of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries.

At this meeting, a team holding a banner reading "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought!" participated. Before the meeting began, they held the Red Book "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" and read aloud.

On the same day, students in Kobe also held rallies and demonstration marches to protest against the crimes of U.S. imperialism. In the march, many people held up large banners reading "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought!" (with attached photo)

On June 7, brave Japanese patriotic students, youth, and members of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox) held protest rallies in front of the U.S. Payahu Base in Fukuoka City, carrying placards with slogans such as "Arm yourself with Mao Zedong Thought!" "Determine to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory!" (New China News Agency photo)

    日本人民反美爱国运动深入发展
    福冈市爱国学生和青年在美国领事馆和基地前集会示威要求撤除美军基地
    京都、神户学生高举“毛泽东思想万岁！”大旗集会抗议美帝罪行
    据新华社八日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本人民抗议美军飞机坠落并焚毁九州大学建筑物的反美爱国运动，正在向纵深发展。
    福冈市人民的抗议运动一天比一天高涨。七日，从早到晚，爱国学生和青年不断到美国领事馆和美国板付空军基地举行抗议集会和示威。
    这天九州大学的四千名学生举行了罢课，并在校本部和分校举行集会，要求撤除板付基地。随后，学生们举着红旗，高唱《国际歌》，雄赳赳地到美国领事馆去抗议。佐藤反动政府出动了几百名武装警察和许多装甲车镇压示威群众。但是，学生们不顾警察的镇压，坚持在美国领事馆前面举行了集会，并不断高呼：“撤除板付基地！”“粉碎日美‘安全条约’！”“反对侵越战争！”“打倒佐藤政府！”
    爱国学生在美国领事馆前面举行了抗议集会后，又在全市举行游行示威。当游行队伍穿过街道时，几万市民热烈鼓掌，表示支持他们的爱国行动。
    日中友好协会（正统）福冈县总部的会员还出动了广播宣传车，号召日本人民进一步行动起来，为废除日美“安全条约”而奋斗。
    在美军板付基地前面，爱国学生的反美斗争更为激烈。反动警察用路障切断了通往基地的一切道路，用装甲车、水龙和全副武装的警察部队对学生的爱国正义斗争进行残暴的镇压。但是，一千五百名英勇的学生、青年和日中友好协会（正统）的会员，突破重重障碍，来到基地大门前，进行了四小时的斗争。他们一次又一次地向基地冲击，猛烈地投掷石块，显示了日本人民敢于斗争的大无畏精神。
    在基地北面的辅助跑道附近，有三千五百名学生举行抗议集会。一部分学生还突破了警察的封锁线，冲进基地，勇敢地向美军建筑物扔石头。同示威队伍一起来到板付基地前面的许多市民，也向基地扔石块，同学生一起战斗。
    在基地大门前的斗争中，有一百多人被反动警察打伤，有十人被捕。但是，血腥镇压并不能使爱国学生放弃战斗。这场斗争一直坚持到晚上九点。
    这天下午，京都、大阪、兵库、奈良、和歌山和滋贺的三千名大学生代表，在京都市同志社大学举行大会，支持福冈市的工人、学生和市民的反美斗争，要求废除日美“安全条约”。他们还热烈赞扬越南人民的抗美救国战争，谴责美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义共同策划的“和谈”骗局。
    他们还高度赞扬美国黑人的抗暴斗争，赞扬法国和其他欧洲国家的学生和工人的斗争，谴责法国、意大利以及其他国家的修正主义分子背叛人民革命事业的罪行。
    他们指出，日共宫本修正主义集团是美日反动派的走狗。
    在这次集会上，有一支高举“毛泽东思想万岁！”的旗帜的队伍。他们在大会开始以前，手捧红色宝书《毛主席语录》高声朗读。
    同一天，神户市的学生也举行集会和示威游行，抗议美帝国主义的罪行。在游行队伍中，有不少人高举着“毛泽东思想万岁！”的大旗前进。（附图片）
    六月七日，英勇的日本爱国学生、青年和日中友好协会（正统）的会员，拿着写有“用毛泽东思想武装起来！！”“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”等标语牌，在福冈市美军板付基地前举行抗议集会。    新华社发（传真照片）
