Albania's spring sowing task has been mostly completed. A large number of people and resources are now being invested in field management work.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Tirana, the Albanian News Agency reported: Albania's rural areas have mostly completed the spring sowing task. The planting of sugar beets, sunflowers, cotton, and many other crops has been completed. In this spring's sowing, the planting area for sunflowers, vegetables, rice, and forage crops has significantly expanded. For example, compared to 1967, the planting area for sunflowers has increased by nearly 40%; the planting area for vegetables has increased by nearly 30% compared to the same period last year.

To accelerate the increase in grain production, while harvesting grain crops along the coast and in low-lying areas, agricultural cooperatives and state farms are taking measures to plant corn on fallow land.

As the spring sowing work is about to be completed, agricultural cooperatives, tractor stations, and state farms have mobilized a large number of people and resources to invest in field management work.

Albanian agricultural workers are further promoting production competitions and have expressed their determination to strive for high yields, ensuring that crops grow strong and healthy.

The heroic Albanian people, under the leadership of the Party of Labor and the great leader Comrade Enver Hoxha, are vigorously promoting proletarian politics and advancing on the path of ideological revolution.

    阿尔巴尼亚春播任务大部分完成
    大批人力物力正在投入田间管理工作
    据新华社地拉那电　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道：阿尔巴尼亚全国农村已经大部分完成了春播任务。甜菜、向日葵、棉花等许多农作物的栽种工作，已经结束。在今年春播中，向日葵、蔬菜、稻谷、饲料作物等的栽种面积，已大为扩大。例如，同一九六七年相比，向日葵栽种面积扩大了将近百分之四十；蔬菜栽种面积比去年同期扩大了将近百分之三十。
    为了加速提高谷物生产，在沿海和低地开始收割谷类作物的同时，农业合作社和国营农场正在采取措施，在休耕地上栽种玉米。
    在春播工作行将结束的时候，农业合作社、机器拖拉机站和国营农场已抽调出大批人力和物力，投入田间管理工作。
    阿尔巴尼亚农业劳动者正在进一步开展生产竞赛，他们表示要争取实现高产量，保证使农作物长得又壮又好。（附图片）
