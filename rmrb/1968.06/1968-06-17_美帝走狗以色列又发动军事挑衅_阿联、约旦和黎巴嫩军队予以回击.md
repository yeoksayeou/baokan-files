Israeli aggressor forces have been continuously launching new military provocations against Egypt, Jordan, and Lebanon in recent days.

The Israeli aggressor forces occupying the east bank of the Suez Canal fired machine guns at the Egyptian positions on the west bank of the Suez Port at the southern end of the canal at noon on the 14th. The Egyptian forces retaliated. Both sides exchanged fire across the canal for more than an hour. On the 15th, the Israeli aggressor forces again provoked Egypt in the middle section of the canal at Firdan. According to an Egyptian military statement, that afternoon, Israeli forces used machine gun fire to cover a group of soldiers descending into the canal and wounded two Egyptian soldiers. The Egyptian forces immediately retaliated, silencing two Israeli machine gun positions, destroying an Israeli observation post, and a munitions depot.

On the 15th, while the Israeli aggressor forces were provoking Egypt in the Suez Canal area, they also opened fire on Jordanian positions near the Allenby Bridge on the east bank of the Jordan River and on border villages in southern Lebanon. The provocations were met with counterattacks by Jordanian and Lebanese forces.

During the Israeli bombardment of the Lebanese village of Mais al-Jabal, four local residents were injured and five houses were destroyed. This was the second Israeli aggression against Lebanese border villages in a month. Last month, the village of Houla, six kilometers north of Mais al-Jabal, was also shelled by Israel.

The Deputy Secretary-General of the Arab League, Nofal, pointed out in Beirut that Israel's new aggression against Arab countries proves that Israel is trying to achieve its territorial expansion through aggression. He called on Arab countries to unite their forces to smash Israel's aggressive plots.

    美帝走狗以色列又发动军事挑衅
    阿联、约旦和黎巴嫩军队予以回击
    新华社开罗十六日电　以色列侵略军连日来不断地向阿联、约旦和黎巴嫩发动新的军事挑衅。
    侵占苏伊士运河东岸的以色列侵略军，十四日中午用机枪扫射运河南端西岸苏伊士港的阿联阵地。阿联军队给予回击。双方隔河交火一个多小时。十五日，以色列侵略军又在运河中段的费丹处向阿联挑衅。据阿联军方的公报说，当天下午，以色列军队用机枪火力掩护一批士兵下到运河，并打伤两名阿联士兵。阿联军队当即给以还击，打哑了以色列的两个机枪阵地，还击毁了以军的一个观察所和一座弹药库。
    以色列侵略军十五日在苏伊士运河区向阿联挑衅的同时，还向约旦河东岸艾伦比桥附近的约旦据点和黎巴嫩南部的边境村庄开火。以军的挑衅遭到约旦和黎巴嫩军队的还击。
    以色列侵略军在炮击黎巴嫩的迈斯加巴勒村时，击伤当地居民四名，击毁房屋五所。这是近一个月来，以色列侵略军对黎巴嫩边境村庄的第二次侵犯。上一个月，迈斯加巴勒北面六公里的胡拉村，就曾遭到以色列的炮击。
    阿拉伯联盟副秘书长诺法勒在贝鲁特指出，以色列对阿拉伯国家发动新的侵略，证明以色列企图用侵略来实现其领土扩张的野心。他呼吁阿拉伯国家集中力量，粉碎以色列的侵略阴谋。
