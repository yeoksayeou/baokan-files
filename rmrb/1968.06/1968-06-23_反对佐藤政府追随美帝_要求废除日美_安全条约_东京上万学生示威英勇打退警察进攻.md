    Oppose the Sato Government's Followership of U.S. Imperialism; Demand the Abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty"
    Tokyo's Ten Thousand Students Brave Police Attack in Protest

    New China News Agency, June 22nd: According to the Oriental News Agency, on June 21st, more than ten thousand students in Tokyo's Kanda student district held a rally and a massive demonstration, strongly demanding the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and opposing the Sato government's following of U.S. imperialism in its expansion and aggression in Southeast Asia. The students bravely fought against the reactionary police and repelled their savage attacks.

    On that day, 1,500 students held a rally in the campus of Chuo University. In their speeches, the students strongly condemned U.S. imperialism's war policies and aggression, and also strongly condemned the Japanese reactionaries' criminal collusion with U.S. imperialism. The students expressed their resolute support for the surging mass struggles in France and in Europe and North America, and severely condemned the treacherous acts of modern revisionists in undermining the mass movements in these countries. After the rally, the students demonstrated on the streets and used desks to build barricades, cutting off traffic. The reactionary Sato government dispatched 1,500 armed police to suppress the students in a fascist manner. The students, relying on the barricades, fought fiercely with the police using sticks and glass bottles. At this time, students from various schools in the Kanda student district came out to support them, and soon the number of demonstrators increased to more than ten thousand. After an hour of fierce battle, the brave students finally repelled the fully armed reactionary police.

    Subsequently, the students held a rally in front of Meiji University and demonstrated on the streets. They sang the "Internationale" loudly, full of fighting spirit, and the demonstration continued until late at night. (Accompanying photo)

    反对佐藤政府追随美帝　要求废除日美“安全条约”
    东京上万学生示威英勇打退警察进攻
    新华社二十二日讯 据东方通讯社报道：日本东京一万多名学生二十一日在神田学生区举行集会和声势浩大的示威游行，强烈要求废除日美“安全条约”，反对佐藤政府追随美帝向东南亚进行扩张和侵略。学生们同反动警察进行了英勇的搏斗，打退了警察的野蛮进攻。
    这一天，一千五百名学生在中央大学校园内举行集会。学生们在发言中强烈谴责美帝的战争政策和侵略政策，并强烈谴责日本反动派同美帝进行的罪恶勾结。学生们表示坚决支持法国以及欧洲、北美各国风起云涌的群众斗争，并且严厉谴责现代修正主义分子破坏这些国家的群众运动的叛卖行径。会后，学生们在大街上示威，并用书桌筑起街垒，使交通断绝。佐藤反动政府出动了一千五百名武装警察，对学生进行法西斯镇压。学生们凭借街垒用木棍和玻璃瓶同警察展开了激烈的搏斗。这时，神田学生区各校的学生纷纷出来声援，不多时，示威学生就增加到一万多人。经过一个小时的激战，英勇的学生终于击退了全副武装的反动警察。
    随后，学生们在明治大学前集会，并到大街上示威游行。他们高唱《国际歌》，斗志昂扬，游行直到深夜。（附图片）
