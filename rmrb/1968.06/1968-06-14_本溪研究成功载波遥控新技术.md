The revolutionary workers of the Second Steel Plant of Benxi Iron and Steel Company, with the assistance of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support troops, have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. They have earnestly carried out Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." Through self-reliance and hard work, after one year and two months of arduous struggle, they have successfully developed the new technology of using industrial television carrier wave remote control in the iron smelting industry. For the first time in China, they have achieved remote control of the blast furnace weighing car.

Carrier wave remote control involves sending specific frequency radio waves from the control panel to the line to control equipment over long distances. Through industrial television, the operating status of the equipment can be reflected in real-time in the control room. Industrial television carrier wave remote control is a combination of these two new technologies. It signifies that the application of electronic technology in the iron smelting industry in China has reached a new level.

In the past, workers at this steel plant had to endure high temperatures and flying dust while weighing and transporting raw materials on the blast furnace weighing car, which had a significant impact on their health. After adopting the new technology of industrial television carrier wave remote control, workers only need to sit in the control room, away from the workstation, and use the television and remote control equipment to accurately control the entire operation of the weighing car, achieving automation of the operation.

    本溪研究成功载波遥控新技术
    本溪钢铁公司第二钢铁厂广大革命职工，在人民解放军支左部队的帮助下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，认真贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，自力更生，奋发图强，经过一年零二个月的艰苦奋战，研究成功了在炼铁工业上采用工业电视载波遥控的新技术，在我国第一次实现了对高炉称量车的远距离控制。
    载波遥控就是从操纵台往线路上发送一定频率的电波，对设备进行远距离控制。通过工业电视，可以把这个设备的运行状况随时反映到操纵室内。工业电视载波遥控就是由这两项新技术组成的，它标志着我国电子技术在炼铁工业上的应用发展到了一个新的水平。
    过去，这个钢铁厂的工人要冒着高温和飞扬的粉尘，在高炉称量车上称量和运送高炉原料，这对健康影响很大。现在采用工业电视载波遥控新技术以后，工人只要坐在远离岗位的操纵室内，通过电视机和遥控设备，便可以准确地控制称量车的全部操作过程，实现了操作的自动化。
