Red flags flutter, and victory songs resound. Amidst the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the People's Liberation Army stationed in the remote regions of the motherland, along with local militia, formed countless Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams. They ventured deep into the grasslands and traversed the mountains, spreading Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line among the people of the brotherly nationalities. Under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, the people of the brotherly nationalities march forward in victory, joyfully declaring: Chairman Mao leads the way, and our hearts are bright.

The red sun rises over the Miaoling Mountains, and every mountain and river sings.

In Guizhou's Miaoling Mountains, where the Miao and Buyi peoples reside, the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines was fierce under the control of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Party committee of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed here studied Chairman Mao's teachings, "Never forget class struggle," and believed that using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to propagate and arm the masses was the greatest act of love for the people and a glorious duty of the army. Thus, they dispatched numerous Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to propagate Mao Zedong Thought in eight communes and over 200 production teams nearby, mobilizing the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to resolutely fight against the class enemy.

The red sun illuminated the deep mountain Miao villages, and the flames of class struggle burned fiercely. When the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team arrived at the Taopo Production Brigade of Zhangbu Commune, they quickly grasped the situation of the class enemy's sabotage of the collective economy through investigations and mobilizing the masses. They organized a class force led by the poor and lower-middle peasants to severely strike back against the class enemy's sabotage activities, consolidating the collective economy and bringing about a new atmosphere of seizing the revolution and promoting production in this formerly backward brigade. In the Bantang Commune's Banpo Production Brigade, Hu Xianzhi of the propaganda team heard that an old poor peasant had fled into the deep mountains due to persecution by the class enemy and had not returned for a long time. Hu Xianzhi decided to bring back this old poor peasant with deep grievances. After climbing mountains and crossing rivers for several days, he finally found the old poor peasant in a deep mountain valley. At the struggle meeting against the capitalist roaders within the Party, this old poor peasant, filled with anger, held up the wild vegetables she had eaten in the mountains and the ragged clothes she had worn for years, exposing the crimes of the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party colluding with the class enemy to persecute her. The old poor peasant's blood-curdling accusations aroused the hatred of the poor and lower-middle peasants towards the class enemy, and they launched a fierce attack with indignation.

The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams also helped the poor and lower-middle peasants of ethnic minorities establish over 200 Mao Zedong Thought study classes and trained 48 sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study instructors. Now, Mao Zedong Thought study classes are being held everywhere in the Miaoling Mountains. The revolutionary masses of the Miao people excitedly sing: The red sun rises over the Miaoling Mountains, and every mountain and river sings; Chairman Mao leads the way, and the Miao people's hearts are bright.

The savior of the grasslands, the benefactor of the herdsmen, is the great leader Chairman Mao.

In the Zhamai Grasslands of Qinghai, the model deeds of Tsurapma, a Tibetan girl who studies and propagates Mao Zedong Thought, are widely circulated.

Tsurapma is the daughter of a serf and the squad leader of the militia in Dongfeng Commune, Angsai Township, Zaduo County. Over the years, with an unbounded loyalty to Chairman Mao, and with the help of the local garrison troops, she organized a militia Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team. They often braved rain, snow, and mud to go to the pastures and grasslands to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. Due to the obstruction of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, they encountered great difficulties in propagating Mao Zedong Thought.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Tsurapma and these class enemies waged a resolute struggle. Following Chairman Mao's instruction, "You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end," she organized the herdsmen to study Chairman Mao's works, sing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, and propagate Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line with the propaganda team. The poor herdsmen welcomed them with applause; while the unrepentant reactionary herdsmen and headmen gnashed their teeth in hatred.

Once, a reactionary herdsman sneaked into a herdsman's tent to tell reactionary superstition stories. Tsurapma, filled with indignation, held up the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and boldly entered, loudly reciting Chairman Mao's quotations: "The core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China. The theoretical basis guiding our thoughts is Marxism-Leninism." She explained "The Class Analysis of Chinese Society," recalling bitterness and sweetness. She said, "Chairman Mao saved us from the sea of bitterness and led us onto the bright road. If the Kuomintang reactionaries return to the grasslands, we will be trampled underfoot by the herdsmen and headmen again and suffer twice." Old Ama Qomayangdrol heard her words and repeatedly said, "In the old society, we listened to reactionary superstition stories for half our lives, believed in Buddhism for half our lives, and chanted scriptures for half our lives, but we still suffered. I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's words and walk the happy road he points out." From then on, Old Ama Qomayangdrol actively studied Chairman Mao's works and not only did she no longer listen to reactionary superstition stories but also persuaded others not to.

Another time, Tsurapma and the militia propaganda team crossed mountains and valleys to a production brigade to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. Someone was telling reactionary superstition stories there. They, despite their fatigue, immediately rushed to the scene. Tsurapma, holding up the red book, loudly declared, "The savior of the grasslands, the benefactor of the herdsmen, is only one, the great leader Chairman Mao." The herdsmen unanimously said, "Yes, yes, yes!" Amidst the herdsmen's enthusiastic welcome, they sang songs of Chairman Mao's quotations and recited the "Three Articles." The person telling reactionary superstition stories, seeing the situation was not good, quickly fled.

Under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, the Zhamai Grasslands have changed. Now, Chairman Mao's portraits hang in the herdsmen's tents, the herdsmen wear shining Chairman Mao badges on their chests, and Chairman Mao's quotation banners flutter on the tops of the tents. In the milking sheds and on the grasslands, one can see herdsmen studying Chairman Mao's works everywhere, and one can hear herdsmen singing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations. The sun of Mao Zedong Thought shines over the vast grasslands, and a red sun that never sets rises in the hearts of the herdsmen.

The Bai people follow Chairman Mao closely, never forgetting class struggle.

The radiance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the Bai people living in the border areas of Yunnan. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, with the support and help of the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of a certain unit of the Kunming Army, they exposed and criticized a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and counter-revolutionary elements, further consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and launching a wave of seizing the revolution and promoting production.

However, the good revolutionary situation made some cadres and a few community members of the production brigade complacent and complacent, saying, "The situation is stable, can the enemy dare to rebel?" Thus, they were busy with production every day and relaxed their struggle against the class enemy. However, the class enemy was not willing to admit defeat. In the Hongwei Production Brigade, a bad element used clan relationships to instigate and incite the masses to direct the struggle spearhead at the revolutionary cadres of the production brigade. When it was difficult to plant seedlings due to drought during spring plowing, he incited the masses to sabotage collective production.

The comrades of the propaganda team actively helped the leadership group of the Hongwei Production Brigade repeatedly study Chairman Mao's great teaching, "Never forget class struggle." Through study, the leadership group of the production brigade clarified that the primary task of safeguarding and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat is to lead the masses in a resolute struggle against the class enemy. They decided to never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, mobilize the broad revolutionary masses, and launch a fierce attack on the class enemy.

Next, the cadres of the production brigade and the Liberation Army went deep into the grassroots, visited the poor, and conducted reminiscence of bitterness and sweetness activities, exposing the class enemy's evil plot to use clan relationships to stir up disputes and restore capitalism. In the reminiscence of bitterness, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants recalled the sufferings of the old society, shedding tears and saying, "There are no wolves that do not eat people, and there are no clan heads that do not drink blood." They resolutely declared: "No matter who he is, as long as he is with Chairman Mao and the poor and lower-middle peasants, we will be with him; whoever opposes Chairman Mao and the dictatorship of the proletariat, we will fight to the death with him." At the struggle meeting against the class enemy, the masses were indignant and full of fighting spirit. The poor and lower-middle peasants charged forward, and the deceived masses turned against the enemy, thoroughly exposing the class enemy's evil plot. The cadres of the production brigade and the broad revolutionary masses received profound education.

Currently, the propaganda team and the broad Bai people are together, launching a big criticism of the revolution, thoroughly criticizing China's Khrushchev's theory of "the extinction of class struggle." The class consciousness of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants has greatly increased. They arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, fight against nature, fight against the class enemy, and fight against the "self" in their minds, defeating the class enemy, overcoming drought, and making the revolution and production flourish.

Thank the dear Liberation Army for bringing Mao Zedong Thought to the hearts of the Tibetan people.

The world's highest city, Pari, is over 4,000 meters above sea level, and the climate changes rapidly, greatly affecting agricultural and sideline production. Under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, the Pari people fight against nature, overcome numerous difficulties, and achieve bumper harvests for six consecutive years.

The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of a certain unit of the Tibet Border Defense Army ascended Pari. They helped the masses study Mao Zedong Thought, encouraged them to dare to struggle and dare to win, overcome natural disasters, and achieve bumper harvests. The broad Tibetan people resolutely acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions, responding to the great leader Chairman Mao's battle call to "seize the revolution and promote production," determined to achieve double victories in revolution and production on the "Roof of the World" and among the ice peaks and snow mountains.

During the sowing season, some advocated planting less, while others advocated expanding the planting area. Regarding this specific issue, the comrades of the propaganda team and the Tibetan revolutionary masses studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought together. After repeated study, they firmed up their resolve and decided to expand the planting area. Pingcu, known as the expert in seizing the revolution and promoting production by the Pari people, said, "Chairman Mao's instructions are the most brilliant. The reason why the Pari people can fight against nature and the earth in the ice peaks and snow mountains of the Himalayas over 4,000 meters above sea level, successfully trial-plant on a large scale, and achieve a significant increase in production is because of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. As long as we act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, we can overcome all difficulties." They finally unanimously determined the battle task: Arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, fight against nature, prevent hail, and take the initiative; fight against the earth, sow in a timely manner, expand the area, and seize grain from the earth; fight against people, and launch a fierce attack on the class enemy.

The Pari people said and did. The next day, they braved the wind and snow and set out in large numbers, some pushing plows, and some wielding pickaxes. In a short time, they reclaimed over 300 acres of wasteland and expanded the planting area. To ensure a high yield and bumper harvest, they braved the cold wind and snow, drove dozens of horse-drawn carts from a pasture 50 miles away to transport over 100,000 pounds of fine fertilizer; mobilized over 1,200 people to eliminate over 600 acres of land rats; and repaired over a dozen irrigation canals a month in advance. The entire Pari plateau was a scene of bustling activity.

Now, when the Pari people talk about the great leader Chairman Mao and the dear "Jinzhuma" (Liberation Army), they sing with deep affection:

The majestic Himalayas, however high, have a top,
The great leader Chairman Mao's grace is boundless.
The red sun shines brightly, and the crops grow lush,
The people are jubilant, and the songs are melodious.
Thank the dear "Jinzhuma"
For bringing Mao Zedong Thought to the hearts of the Tibetan people.

    兄弟民族人民心里升起了永远不落的红太阳
    红旗飘飘，凯歌阵阵。在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，驻守在祖国边远地区的人民解放军和当地民兵，组成千千万万个毛泽东思想宣传队，深入草原，走遍山寨，向兄弟民族人民宣传毛泽东思想，宣传毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。兄弟民族人民在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下胜利前进，他们高兴地说道：毛主席前边来领路，我们心里亮堂堂。
    苗岭升起红太阳，山山水水把歌唱
    贵州的苗岭山区，是苗族、布依族聚居的地方。
    过去，在党内一小撮走资派的控制下，这里两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争十分激烈。在无产阶级文化大革命中，驻守在这里的解放军某部党委学习了毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，认为用战无不胜的毛泽东思想宣传群众，武装群众，是最大的爱民，是我军的光荣职责。于是，他们派出许多毛泽东思想宣传队，深入到附近的八个公社、二百多个生产队宣传毛泽东思想，发动广大贫下中农向阶级敌人展开坚决的斗争。
    红太阳照亮了深山苗寨，阶级斗争的烈火熊熊燃烧。毛泽东思想宣传队来到掌布公社桃坡生产队，经过访贫问苦，发动群众，很快地掌握了阶级敌人破坏集体经济的情况，组织以贫下中农为主体的阶级队伍，狠狠地打击阶级敌人的破坏活动，巩固了集体经济，使这个原来落后的队，出现了狠抓革命，猛促生产的新气象。在大塘公社半坡生产队，宣传队的胡先智，听说有一个老贫农因受阶级敌人的迫害，逃进深山，很长时间没有回来。胡先智决心把这个苦大仇深的老贫农接回来。他爬山涉水找了几天，终于在一个深山沟里，找到了这个老贫农。在斗争党内走资派的大会上，这位老贫农怒火填胸，她拿着几年来在深山里吃的野菜和穿的破衣服，控诉了党内一小撮走资派勾结阶级敌人迫害她的罪行。老贫农的血泪控诉，激起了贫下中农对阶级敌人的仇恨，他们满腔怒火，向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻。
    毛泽东思想宣传队还帮助少数民族贫下中农办了二百多个毛泽东思想学习班，训练了四十八期学习毛泽东思想辅导员。现在，苗岭山区到处办起了毛泽东思想学习班。苗族革命群众兴奋地唱道：苗岭升起红太阳，山山水水把歌唱；毛主席前边来领路，苗家心里亮堂堂。
        草原的救星，牧民的恩人，就
    是伟大领袖毛主席
    在青海札美草原，广泛流传着藏族姑娘曲沙波毛学习、宣传毛泽东思想的模范事迹。
    曲沙波毛是个农奴的女儿，是杂多县昂赛乡东风公社的民兵排长。几年来，她凭着一颗无限忠于毛主席的红心，在当地驻军帮助下，组织了一支民兵毛泽东思想宣传队，经常冒着大雨，踩着积雪、泥泞，到牧场、草滩，宣传毛泽东思想。由于党内一小撮走资派等的阻挠，给他们宣传毛泽东思想造成了极大的困难。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，曲沙波毛和这些阶级敌人进行了坚决的斗争。她遵照毛主席“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的教导，和宣传队一起组织牧民学习毛主席著作，唱毛主席语录歌，宣传毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。贫苦牧民对他们拍手欢迎；而没有改造好的反动牧主、头人却咬牙切齿，仇恨他们。
    有一次，一个反动牧主钻进牧民帐篷讲反动迷信故事。曲沙波毛听到后，满腔怒火，高举红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，大步地闯了进去，高声朗读毛主席语录：“领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义。”她讲解《中国社会各阶级的分析》，忆苦思甜。她说：“毛主席把我们从苦海中救了出来，领导我们走上了光明大道。如果叫国民党反动派再回到草原，我们就要重新被牧主、头人踩在脚下，吃二遍苦。”老阿妈卓玛永错听了她的话，连声说：“旧社会我们听了半辈子反动迷信故事，信了半辈子佛，念了半辈子经，还是受苦。我一定听毛主席的话，走毛主席指引的幸福路。”从那以后，卓玛永错老阿妈积极学习毛主席著作，不但自己再不听反动迷信故事，还劝阻别人不要听。
    又一次，曲沙波毛和民兵宣传队翻山越岭，来到一个生产队宣传毛泽东思想，有人又在这里讲反动迷信故事。他们不顾疲劳，立即赶到了现场，曲沙波毛手举红宝书，高声说道：“草原的救星，牧民的恩人，只有一个，那就是伟大领袖毛主席。”牧民们齐声说：对，对，对！在牧民们的热烈欢迎下，他们演唱毛主席语录歌，朗诵“老三篇”。讲反动迷信故事的人一看情况不妙，赶紧溜掉了。
    在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，札美草原变样了。如今，牧民的帐篷里都挂着毛主席像，牧民们的胸前带上了金光闪闪的毛主席像章，帐篷顶上飘扬着鲜艳的毛主席语录旗。挤奶场上，草滩上，到处都可以看到牧民们在学习毛主席著作，到处都可以听到牧民们高唱毛主席语录歌的歌声。毛泽东思想的阳光，普照着辽阔的草原，牧民心中升起了永远不落的红太阳。
    白族人民紧跟毛主席，阶级斗争永不忘
    毛泽东思想的光辉，照亮了居住在云南边疆的白族人民。他们在无产阶级文化大革命中，在昆明部队某部毛泽东思想宣传队的支持和帮助下，揭发和批判了党内一小撮走资派以及反革命分子，进一步巩固了无产阶级专政，掀起了抓革命促生产的热潮。
    可是，大好的革命形势却使生产队的个别干部和少数社员群众，产生了自满和麻痹情绪，他们说，大局已定，敌人还敢翻天吗？于是整天忙于生产，放松了对阶级敌人的斗争。然而，阶级敌人是不甘心失败的。红卫生产队有个坏家伙，利用宗族关系，挑拨离间，煽动群众把斗争矛头指向生产队的革命干部。当春耕干旱插秧困难时，他煽动群众破坏集体生产。
    宣传队的同志积极帮助红卫生产队领导小组反复学习毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导。通过学习，生产队领导小组明确了保卫和巩固无产阶级专政的首要任务是带领群众向阶级敌人作坚决的斗争。他们决心念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，把广大革命群众发动起来，向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻。
    接着，生产队的干部和解放军一起，深入基层，访贫问苦，开展忆苦思甜活动，揭露阶级敌人妄图用宗族关系挑起纠纷，复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋。在忆苦中，广大贫下中农回忆起旧社会遭受的苦难，流着眼泪说：“世间没有不吃人的豺狼，没有不喝人血的宗族头子。”他们坚决地表示：不管他是那一族那一姓，只要和毛主席一条心，和贫下中农一条心，我们就和他亲；谁反对毛主席，反对无产阶级专政，我们就和谁拚。在斗争阶级敌人的大会上，群情激愤，斗志昂扬，贫下中农打冲锋，受蒙蔽群众反戈一击，把阶级敌人的罪恶阴谋彻底地揭露出来。生产队的干部和广大革命群众受到了深刻的教育。
    目前，宣传队和广大白族人民在一起，大抓革命的大批判，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，广大贫下中农阶级觉悟大大提高，他们用毛泽东思想武装头脑，与天斗，与地斗，与阶级敌人斗，与自己头脑里“私”字斗，战胜了阶级敌人，战胜了干旱，革命、生产热火朝天。
        感谢亲人解放军把毛泽东思想送
    到我们藏族人民的心坎上
    世界高城——帕里，拔海四千多米，气候瞬息万变，对农副业生产有极大的影响。帕里人民在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，与天斗，与地斗，克服重重困难，连续六年获得大丰收。
    西藏边防部队某部毛泽东思想宣传队登上了帕里。他们帮助群众学习毛泽东思想，鼓励他们敢于斗争，敢于胜利，战胜天灾，夺取丰收。广大藏族人民坚决照毛主席的指示办事，以实际行动响应伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的战斗号召，决心在“世界屋脊”上，在冰峰雪岭间，夺取革命、生产的双胜利。
    在播种的时候，有人主张少种，有人主张扩大种植面积。针对这个具体问题，宣传队的同志和藏族革命群众一起活学活用毛泽东思想。经过反复学习，他们坚定了信心，决定扩大播种面积。被帕里人称为抓革命、促生产能手的平措说：“毛主席的指示最英明。我们帕里人民所以能在拔海四千多米的喜马拉雅山的冰峰雪岭间抗天斗地，大面积试种成功，并夺得大幅度增产，就是靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想。只要我们按照毛主席的指示办事，就能克服一切困难。最后一致确定了战斗任务：用毛泽东思想武装头脑，与天斗，预防冰雹，争取主动；与地斗，适时播种，扩大面积，向地要粮；与人斗，向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻。
    帕里人说干就干。第二天，他们就冒着风雪，纷纷出动，有的扶犁，有的挥镐，在很短时间内，就开垦荒地三百多克，扩大了播种面积。为了争取高产丰收，他们冒着寒风大雪，赶几十辆马车，从五十里路外的牧场运回十多万斤细肥；出动一千二百多人次消灭了六百多克土地上的地老鼠；提前一个月整修好了十几条水渠。整个帕里高原，一片热气腾腾的景象。
    现在，帕里人民一谈起伟大领袖毛主席和亲人“金珠玛米”（解放军），都无限深情地唱道：
    巍峨的喜马拉雅山再高也有顶，
    伟大领袖毛主席的恩情大无边。
    红太阳高照禾苗茁壮，
    人民欢腾歌声嘹亮。
    感谢亲人“金珠玛米”，
    把毛泽东思想送到我们藏族人民的心坎上。
                        （据新华社二十一日讯）
