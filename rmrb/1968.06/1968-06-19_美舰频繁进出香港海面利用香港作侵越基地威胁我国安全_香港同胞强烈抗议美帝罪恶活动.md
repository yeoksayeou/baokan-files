Recently, warships of the U.S. Seventh Fleet participating in the Vietnam War have been frequently entering and exiting Hong Kong waters, fully exposing that U.S. imperialism is intensifying its use of Hong Kong as a base to expand its aggression in Vietnam and threaten China's security.

Statistics show that in April alone, 39 U.S. warships entered Hong Kong, which is 50 percent more than the average number in the first three months of this year. These include the aircraft carriers "Enterprise" and "Yorktown," the nuclear submarine "Swordfish," the missile cruiser "Chicago," and eight other warships equipped with missiles. Especially since the middle of April, after Johnson held a secret meeting with military and political leaders in Honolulu, U.S. warships entering Hong Kong have become even more frequent, with an average of more than ten ships docked in Hong Kong waters daily. In the first week of May, another 12 U.S. warships intruded into Hong Kong waters, including the attack aircraft carrier "Constellation" of the U.S. Seventh Fleet. This reflects that Johnson's "peace talks" are completely a fraud, intended to cover up his plot to intensify the Vietnam War.

It is worth noting that over the past year, as U.S. imperialism has continued to expand its war of aggression in Vietnam, the number of U.S. warships entering Hong Kong has been increasing. In 1967, nearly 400 U.S. warships participating in the Vietnam War entered Hong Kong, with an average of more than six ships docked in Hong Kong waters daily, setting a record high in the past 12 years. During this period, almost all U.S. warships participating in the Vietnam War have visited Hong Kong. It is particularly noteworthy that the number of U.S. nuclear-powered ships entering Hong Kong has been increasing year by year. In 1967, there were four such ships: "Enterprise," "Long Beach," "Permit," and "Tecumseh"; and in the first four months of this year, there have been three more: "Truxtun," "Seadragon," and "Swordfish."

For many years, U.S. imperialism, in its expansion of the war of aggression in Vietnam, has been increasingly brazen in fully utilizing Hong Kong as its military activity base. Since the end of 1961, when the Kennedy administration launched its aggression against South Vietnam, more than 2,000 U.S. warships have entered Hong Kong for activities, with more than 200,000 U.S. aggressor troops visiting Hong Kong each year.

In recent years, U.S. military aircraft have also frequently used Hong Kong's Kai Tak Airport to serve its Vietnam War. U.S. imperialism has actually turned Hong Kong into its "midway station" for air military transport in Southeast Asia. According to materials from the "Civil Aviation Department" annual report of the Hong Kong British authorities, large numbers of U.S. military aircraft transporting personnel and military supplies for the Vietnam War frequently travel between Hong Kong and U.S. military bases. Among the more than 30 U.S. military bases in Southeast Asia and the Pacific region, many have aircraft coming and going to Hong Kong's Kai Tak Airport.

U.S. imperialism also uses Hong Kong as a logistics and supply base to procure materials for its Vietnam War. In recent years, large quantities of war materials, including electronic equipment, weapon parts, metal products, machinery, medicines, military uniforms, etc., have been continuously shipped from Hong Kong to South Vietnam. Some ships used by U.S. troops in Vietnam are also built in Hong Kong. Recently, U.S. imperialism has also ordered a large number of military television sets, radio communication devices, military belts, and ammunition belts from Hong Kong.

With the support of the British Wilson government, the U.S. military use of Hong Kong has become increasingly open. It openly sets up various military institutions in Hong Kong, including the "Naval Attaché Office," "Air Force Attaché Office," "Army Attaché Office," "Naval Procurement Office," and a large number of other intelligence agencies. The "United Airlines" Hong Kong branch office established on February 19 of this year, under the guise of a commercial institution, is actually an institution for U.S. military transport between Hong Kong, South Vietnam, Thailand, and the Philippines.

The heinous crime of U.S. imperialism in using Hong Kong as a base for its Vietnam War activities is a manifestation of the British Wilson government and the Hong Kong British authorities following U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression and war. British officials have repeatedly expressed their welcome to U.S. warships entering Hong Kong for activities. The Hong Kong Governor, David Trench, openly stated to the press in London last September that Britain not only "does not want to stop" U.S. troops from entering Hong Kong for activities, "but we are happy to have them there."

Hong Kong patriots have repeatedly strongly protested against the heinous activities of U.S. imperialism in Hong Kong and strongly condemned the British government and the Hong Kong British authorities for their hostility towards the Vietnamese and Chinese peoples, providing Hong Kong to the United States as a base for Vietnam War activities. They recently stated at some meetings that they will definitely follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao: "People of the world, unite more closely, launch a sustained and fierce attack on our common enemy, U.S. imperialism and its running dogs!" They will carry out the anti-imperialist and patriotic movement deeply and persistently, and resolutely smash the heinous plot of U.S. imperialism to use Hong Kong as a military base for aggression.

### 美舰频繁进出香港海面利用香港作侵越基地威胁我国安全  香港同胞强烈抗议美帝罪恶活动

    美舰频繁进出香港海面利用香港作侵越基地威胁我国安全
    香港同胞强烈抗议美帝罪恶活动
    新华社香港十四日电  最近以来，参加侵越战争的美国第七舰队的军舰，更加频繁地进出香港海面，充分暴露了美帝国主义正在加紧利用香港作为扩大侵略越南、威胁中国安全的活动基地。
    据统计，仅四月份来港的美舰就达三十九艘次，比今年头三个月的平均数增加百分之五十。其中包括航空母舰“突击队员号”和“约克城号”，核潜艇“剑鱼号”，导弹重巡洋舰“芝加哥号”及其他八艘配有导弹装备的战斗舰只。特别从四月下半月约翰逊在檀香山与各军政头目举行了秘密会议之后，美舰进入香港更为频繁，平均每天有十艘以上停泊在香港海面。五月份头一个星期，又有十二艘美国军舰闯进香港海面，其中包括美国第七舰队攻击型航空母舰“奇地霍克号”。这反映了约翰逊所玩弄的“和谈”完全是骗局，是为了掩盖他强化侵越战争的一个罪恶阴谋。
    值得指出的是，过去一年多来，随着美帝国主义不断扩大侵略越南的战争，来香港的美国军舰日益增加。去年一年，来香港活动的侵越美舰近四百艘次，停泊在香港海面的美舰平均每日有六艘以上，创十二年来的最高纪录。在此期间内，差不多所有参加侵越战争的美舰，都先后到过香港活动。尤其值得注意的是，美国核动力舰只来港活动逐年增加，去年有“企业号”、“长滩号”、“石首鱼号”和“流氓号”四艘；今年头四个月内又来了“海龙号”、“特鲁克斯顿号”和“剑鱼号”三艘。
    多年来，美帝国主义在扩大侵略越南的战争中，越来越肆无忌惮地全面利用香港作为它的军事活动基地。从一九六一年年底美国肯尼迪政府发动对越南南方的侵略战争以来，来香港活动的美国军舰已超过两千艘次，每年到香港活动的美国侵略军人数多达二十万人次。
    最近几年，美国军用飞机也频繁地使用香港的启德机场为它的侵越战争服务。美帝国主义实际上把香港变成了它在东南亚的空中军事运输“中途站”。据港英当局“民航处年报”的材料透露，大批运载侵越美军人员和军事物资的美国侵略军机，经常来往香港和美国军事基地之间。美国在东南亚和太平洋地区的军事基地中，有三十多个同香港的启德机场有军机来往。
    美帝国主义还把香港作为它搜罗侵越战争物资的后勤补给基地。近几年，大批战争物资包括电子设备、武器零件、五金器材、机器、药品、军用衣物等，源源不断地从香港运往南越。一些供侵越美军使用的船只也在香港订造。最近，美帝国主义又在香港订购了大批军用电视机、无线电对话机、军用皮带、子弹带等军用物资。
    由于英国威尔逊政府的支持，美国在军事上利用香港已经越来越公开化。它明目张胆地在香港设立各种军事机构，包括公开设立的“海军武官处”、“空军武官处”、“陆军武官处”、“海军购料处”和另外一大批情报机关。今年二月十九日设立的以商务性机构为幌子的美国“联合航空公司”香港总办事处，实际上是美国在香港、南越、泰国和菲律宾四个地区之间从事军事运输的机构。
    美帝国主义猖狂地利用香港作为它侵越战争活动基地的罪行，是英国威尔逊政府和港英当局追随美帝国主义侵略政策和战争政策的表现。英国官方曾多次表示欢迎美国侵略军舰来港活动。港英“总督”戴麟趾去年九月在伦敦公开向新闻界表示，英国不仅“不想制止”美军到香港活动，“我们反而喜欢他们在那里”。
    香港爱国同胞对美帝国主义在香港的罪恶活动曾一再提出强烈抗议，对英国政府和港英当局敌视越南人民和中国人民，把香港提供给美国作为侵越战争活动基地，提出强烈的谴责。他们最近在一些集会上表示，一定要遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“全世界人民更紧密地团结起来，向着我们的共同敌人美帝国主义及其帮凶们发动持久的猛烈的进攻！”把反帝爱国运动深入持久地开展下去，坚决粉碎美帝国主义利用香港作为军事侵略基地的罪恶阴谋。
