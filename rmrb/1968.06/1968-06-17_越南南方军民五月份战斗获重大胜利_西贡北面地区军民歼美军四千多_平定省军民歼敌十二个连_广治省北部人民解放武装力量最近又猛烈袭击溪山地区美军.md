The military and civilians in the Saigon North region of South Vietnam launched a series of attacks on the U.S. and puppet forces in May, annihilating 6,342 enemy troops, including 4,143 U.S. invaders.

In the same month, the military and civilians in this region also shot down or destroyed 71 enemy aircraft, destroyed or damaged 583 enemy vehicles, and forced the enemy to abandon 20 outposts and sentry posts. They also liberated more than 10,000 residents from enemy control.

The report said that starting from the night of May 4, the military and civilians in the Saigon North region broke through many enemy lines, attacking 40 enemy targets in rural areas and towns, putting the enemy in a very passive position. Many important enemy strongholds, bases, and command centers, as well as the county seats of Cu Chi, Bien Hoa, Duong Minh Chau, and Thuan An, were all subjected to artillery bombardment and attacks by the liberation army.

The people of the Saigon North region rose up en masse to fight the enemy alongside the People's Liberation Armed Forces, forcing the enemy to withdraw from many outposts and sentry posts, destroying many enemy administrative organs, and cutting off important enemy supply lines in the Saigon North region. Along the first highway, the military and civilians of the Saigon North region have dealt heavy blows to the enemy, annihilating more than 700 U.S. invaders and destroying 79 tanks and armored vehicles, leaving many enemy outposts and sentry posts along the highway in an isolated state.

At the same time, the military and civilians of the Saigon North region also smashed many enemy "sweeping" operations. Just in the counties of Cu Chi and Thuan An, the military and civilians smashed the enemy's continuous counterattacks, annihilating more than 2,200 enemy troops.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Hanoi on June 15, the military and civilians of the provinces of Phu Yen, Kontum, Gia Lai, and Dac Lac in South Vietnam launched successive attacks on the enemy in May, achieving significant victories.

In this period, the military and civilians of Phu Yen Province engaged in more than 140 battles, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 2,300 enemy troops (including more than 1,000 U.S. invaders), completely annihilating 12 enemy companies (including 8 U.S. companies), destroying or damaging 121 enemy vehicles, shooting down or destroying 29 aircraft, and destroying 9 cannons.

During the battles, the military and civilians of Phu Yen Province actively struck the enemy from the plains to the mountains, achieving many outstanding victories. On May 5, the People's Liberation Armed Forces completely annihilated a company each of U.S. and puppet forces near Phu My County. On May 9, they again completely annihilated a reconnaissance company of puppet forces west of Qui Nhon City in the Chi Lang area. From May 5 to 26, the People's Liberation Armed Forces in the northern region of Phu My County continuously attacked the enemy in the Tan Hoa and Trung Hoi areas, winning ten consecutive victories and killing or wounding 570 enemy troops.

The People's Liberation Armed Forces in the Central Highlands provinces of Kontum, Gia Lai, and Dac Lac launched continuous attacks on the enemy in May, annihilating more than 2,800 enemy troops (including more than 1,800 U.S. invaders), shooting down or destroying 42 enemy aircraft, and destroying or damaging nearly 260 enemy vehicles.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Hanoi on June 15, the People's Liberation Armed Forces in the northern part of Quang Tri Province in South Vietnam launched fierce attacks on the enemy in the Khe Sanh area on June 10 and 11, annihilating a total of 224 U.S. invaders.

The report said that on the night of June 10, the People's Liberation Armed Forces attacked a command post and an artillery position of a U.S. Marine Corps battalion on Hill 635 southeast of Da Krong. The liberation army soldiers fought fiercely, almost annihilating the enemy there, killing or wounding 150 U.S. invaders; they also destroyed two enemy cannons and seized a batch of weapons.

On the morning of June 11, the enemy air-dropped reinforcements to Hill 814, about one kilometer northeast of Hill 635, in an attempt to relieve the pressure on Hill 635. However, the liberation army soldiers immediately surrounded this batch of enemy troops, killing 74 on the spot.
