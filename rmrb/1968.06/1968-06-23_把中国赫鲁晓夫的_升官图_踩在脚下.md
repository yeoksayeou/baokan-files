    Trample the "Promotion Chart" of the Chinese Khrushchev Underfoot
    Beijing Municipality Fangshan County Kou Tou Production Brigade Knowledge Youth Gao Guifang

    Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "All those intellectuals who can go to the countryside to work should gladly go there. The countryside is a vast expanse, and there is great potential for achievement there." However, the Chinese Khrushchev uses reactionary bourgeois ideology to poison and corrupt the youth. He blatantly says: "To obtain the 'farmer' title, if the masses elect you as the county committee secretary, then at that time you will become such a person, your position is the county committee secretary, your educational level is high school graduate, and your personal status is a farmer. Do you think I designed it well for you?" It is obvious that the "promotion chart" designed by the Chinese Khrushchev for us is a bourgeois one! He does not want us youth to go to the three great revolutionary movements to temper ourselves, to serve the people wholeheartedly, and to be loyal servants of the people, but wants us youth to use obtaining the "farmer" title as a means to climb up the ladder, seek official positions, and get rich. If we follow the "promotion chart" of the Chinese Khrushchev, then we will inevitably become selfish revisionists, becoming his vanguard in restoring capitalism.

    In 1961, I responded to Chairman Mao's great call, with a burning heart, came to the frontline of agriculture. I am determined to be a socialist farmer, dedicating my youth to the great socialist revolution and socialist construction. In the countryside, I actively participated in the three great revolutionary movements, earnestly studied Chairman Mao's works, reformed my bourgeois ideology, and strove to narrow the gap between my thoughts and feelings and those of the poor and lower-middle peasants. The harder the farm work, the more bravely I took it on; the dirtier the farm work, the more eagerly I did it. In the three great revolutionary movements, I formed a deep class bond with the poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants gave me great encouragement, saying: "Guifang truly deserves to be a descendant of us poor and lower-middle peasants."

    Although I obtained the "farmer" title, what I think of is not becoming an official, but that my contributions to the Party are too small and that I am still far from meeting the poor and lower-middle peasants' expectations of me. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I, together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, thoroughly criticized the Chinese Khrushchev and his local agents, achieving great victories in revolution and production. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants trust me and elected me into the new leading cadre team. Faced with new tests, I firmly follow Chairman Mao's instruction to "be both an official and a common person," humbly learn from the masses, and forever be a servant of the people. We revolutionary youth do not want to be officials, but want revolution. Let the "promotion chart" of the Chinese Khrushchev go to hell!

    Chairman Mao has pointed out the path of integrating with workers and peasants for us intellectual youth, which is the necessary path for our ideological revolutionization. In the future, I will definitely better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, be infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, dedicating my life to the great proletarian revolutionary cause!

    把中国赫鲁晓夫的“升官图”踩在脚下
    北京市房山县口头大队知识青年　高桂芳
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“一切可以到农村中去工作的这样的知识分子，应当高兴地到那里去。农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的。”可是，中国赫鲁晓夫却用反动的资产阶级思想毒害和腐蚀青年。他胡说什么：“取得‘农民’这个光荣称号，将来如果群众选你做了县委书记，那么，那时候你将成为这样一个人，你的职务是县委书记，文化程度是高中毕业，本人成份是农民，你看我给你设计得好不好？”很明显，中国赫鲁晓夫为我们“设计”的，是一幅资产阶级的“升官图”！他不是要我们青年到三大革命运动中去锻炼自己，全心全意为人民服务，当人民忠实的勤务员，而是要我们青年把取得“农民”这个光荣称号，作为升官发财向上爬的手段。如果我们按照中国赫鲁晓夫这幅“升官图”走下去，那末我们就势必成为利欲熏心的修正主义分子，成为他复辟资本主义的马前卒。
    一九六一年，我响应毛主席的伟大号召，怀着一颗火热的心来到了农业第一线。我决心当一个社会主义的农民，把青春献给伟大的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业。在农村，我积极投到轰轰烈烈的三大革命运动中，认真学习毛主席著作，改造自己的资产阶级思想，争取尽快地缩小自己同贫下中农思想感情的距离。哪种农活最累，我就勇敢去担；哪种农活最脏，我就抢着去干。我在三大革命运动中，同贫下中农结下了深厚的阶级感情。贫下中农给了我很大的鼓励，他们说：“桂芳真不愧是咱贫下中农的后代。”
    虽然我取得了“农民”这个光荣称号，但是我想到的并不是做什么官，而是自己对党的贡献太小了，离贫下中农对自己的要求还很远。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我和广大贫下中农大造了中国赫鲁晓夫和他在本地区代理人的反，取得了革命和生产的巨大胜利。广大贫下中农信得过我，把我选进了新的领导班子。在新的考验面前，我坚决遵照毛主席“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的教导，虚心向群众学习，永做人民的勤务员。我们革命青年不是要做官，而是要革命。让中国赫鲁晓夫的“升官图”见鬼去吧！
    毛主席给我们知识青年指出的走同工农相结合的道路，是我们知识青年的思想革命化的必由之路。今后，我一定要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，把自己的一生献给伟大的无产阶级革命事业！
