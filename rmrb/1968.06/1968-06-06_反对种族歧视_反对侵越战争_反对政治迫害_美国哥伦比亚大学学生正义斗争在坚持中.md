More than 1,500 students at Columbia University in New York held a large-scale demonstration on June 4, surrounding the St. John's Church where the university's graduation ceremony was being held. At the same time, more than 200 senior students walked out of the graduation ceremony to protest the university's political persecution of students.

The just struggle of Columbia University students against racial discrimination, against the Vietnam War, and against political persecution, which began on April 23, has been ongoing. This has kept the university in a state of paralysis, causing the U.S. reactionary authorities to be in a state of panic.

On June 3, with the support of the U.S. reactionary authorities, the university president, Kirk, brazenly ordered more than 700 students who had occupied five school buildings at the end of April to "self-suspend," attempting to use high-pressure tactics to suppress the progressive student movement at Columbia University. The so-called "Joint Committee on University Rules for Faculty, Staff, and Students" controlled by the school also openly supported this order.

The school's high-pressure tactics did not intimidate the progressive students at Columbia University. They broke through the immense pressure and held another large-scale demonstration. The students' struggle won the support of the broad masses.

The university authorities are terrified of the students' just struggle. According to the school's tradition, the graduation ceremony is held outdoors on campus, and President Kirk is also supposed to give a speech during the ceremony. This year, however, fearing the immense power of the progressive student movement, the school authorities had to sneak out to St. John's Church outside the school to hold the graduation ceremony. Kirk did not dare to show his face. They even deployed police both inside the school and inside St. John's Church.

    反对种族歧视　反对侵越战争　反对政治迫害
    美国哥伦比亚大学学生正义斗争在坚持中
    新华社五日讯　纽约消息：美国哥伦比亚大学一千五百多名学生，四日在纽约举行大规模的示威游行，包围了这个大学正在举行毕业典礼的圣约翰教堂；同时有二百多名高年级学生退出了这个毕业典礼，抗议这个大学对学生进行政治迫害。
    震动美国的哥伦比亚大学学生反对种族歧视、反对侵越战争、反对政治迫害的正义斗争，从四月二十三日爆发以来一直在坚持中。这使得这所大学一直陷于瘫痪，美国反动当局为此惊慌不安。
    三日，这个大学的校长柯克在美国反动当局的支持下，竟悍然勒令四月底占领学校五所大楼的七百多名学生“自动停学”，妄图采用高压手段来扼杀哥伦比亚大学的进步学生运动。这个学校所控制的所谓“校方、教职员、学生遵守校规联合委员会”，也公然出来支持这个勒令。
    校方的高压手段并没有吓倒哥伦比亚大学的进步学生，他们冲破巨大的压力，再次举行了这次声势浩大的示威。学生的斗争赢得了广大群众的声援。
    大学当局对学生的正义斗争怕得要命。按照这个学校的传统，毕业典礼是在校内露天举行，校长柯克还要在仪式上发表演说。今年，慑于进步学生运动的巨大威力，学校当局不得不偷偷地跑到学校外面的圣约翰教堂去举行毕业典礼，校长柯克更是不敢露面。他们甚至还在校内和圣约翰教堂内布满了警察。
