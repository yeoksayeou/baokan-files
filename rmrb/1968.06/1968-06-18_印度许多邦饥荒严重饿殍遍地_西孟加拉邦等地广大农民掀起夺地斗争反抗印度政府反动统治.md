	New Delhi, June 17 (Xinhua) — While Indian reactionary government officials are boasting about this year's "bumper harvest," Indian newspapers have revealed that severe famines and starvation deaths have occurred in some states.

	According to a report by the weekly "Link," Andhra Pradesh has suffered a severe famine this year. According to official estimates, which have been greatly reduced, in the 11 famine-stricken counties, more than a million landless hired farmers and poor peasants have no means of livelihood and cannot survive.

	The "Indian Express" reported that in some famine-stricken areas of Assam, due to the unprecedented shortage of food, people are living in misery. In Lower Assam, about 100,000 farmers have gone without food for many days in a row.

	The "Indian Times" reported that in some areas in the northeastern part of Orissa, more than eight million people have been affected by the famine, and many cases of starvation deaths have occurred.

	The Indian reactionary government attempts to attribute the cause of the famine to "drought," in order to cover up its crime of cruelly exploiting and oppressing the people, making them unable to live. However, even the "Indian Express" admits that the government's so-called "natural disaster" is only "a convenient shield," and "the current food crisis is mainly man-made."

	The continuous famines in India year after year are awakening the Indian farmers more and more. They are increasingly realizing that the Indian big landlords and big bourgeoisie, in collusion with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, are ruthlessly plundering the vast majority of Indian farmers, which is the root cause of the continuous famines and the people's miserable lives. Recently, Indian newspapers revealed that in some places in West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, and the Central Province, farmers have launched land seizure struggles again, resisting the reactionary rule of the Indian government.

    印度许多邦饥荒严重饿殍遍地
    西孟加拉邦等地广大农民掀起夺地斗争反抗印度政府反动统治
    新华社讯  新德里消息：正当印度反动政府官员在大肆吹嘘今年粮食“丰收”时，印度报纸透露了一些邦发生严重饥荒和饿死人的消息。
    据《联系》周刊报道，安得拉邦今年发生严重饥荒，据官方承认的大大缩小了的估计，在发生饥荒的十一个县中，有一百多万无地的雇农和贫农毫无生计、无法活下去。
    《印度快报》报道，在阿萨姆邦的一些饥荒地区，由于出现了前所未见的缺粮情况，人民过着悲惨的生活。在下阿萨姆大约有十万农民连续好多天吃不上饭。
    《印度时报》报道，在奥里萨邦东北部的一些地区，遭受饥荒的有八百多万人，已经发生了多起饿死人的事件。
    印度反动政府力图把饥荒的原因归之于“旱灾”，以掩盖它残酷剥削、压榨人民，使人民活不下去的罪行。但是，连《印度快报》也承认，印度政府提出的所谓“天灾”的口实只是“一个方便的挡箭牌”，“目前的粮食危机主要是人为造成的。”
    印度连年不断的饥荒，正在促使印度农民日益觉醒，他们越来越认识到印度大地主、大资产阶级勾结美帝、苏修残酷掠夺印度广大农民，是造成连年饥荒、民不聊生的根源。前些时候，印度报纸透露，在西孟加拉邦、安得拉邦和中央邦的一些地方，农民又掀起了夺地斗争，反抗印度政府的反动统治。
