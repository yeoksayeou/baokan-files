The Tito traitor clique in Yugoslavia is forcibly pushing through a comprehensive restoration of capitalism under the guise of "economic reform," causing the domestic economy to deteriorate significantly. Students living under the revisionist rule of Yugoslavia face great hardships. The Yugoslav revisionist newspaper _Borba_ recently admitted that as early as 1964, "students' shallow pockets were hit by the first blow," and subsequently, "with the economic reform came the second blow." After implementing the Tito clique's "economic reform," "the living expenses of students living in dormitories increased by about seventy percent, while for other students, it almost doubled."

Not only have living expenses risen sharply, but in many places, student scholarships have been significantly reduced. According to this Yugoslav revisionist newspaper, "scholarships are becoming increasingly difficult to obtain, and recently, more and more are being obtained by the children of the rich and powerful. The student loan fund of the republic cannot even cover half of the necessary expenses for studying and living in large cities." Therefore, "some people will consider their material problems more than their studies."

In today's universities under Yugoslav revisionist rule, some privileged classes and high-ranking officials' children enjoy various special treatments, while the children of workers and peasants are marginalized and live in hardship. According to _Borba_, in the student body of Belgrade University, the proportion of students from worker backgrounds dropped from 15.1% in 1962 to 12.4% in 1967. At the University of Ljubljana, 49% of the students come from so-called "official" families (a small privileged class), while only 20% come from worker families and just 8% from peasant families.

In the distribution of scholarships, students in technical departments receive much more than those in social sciences and teacher training departments. This is because "students in technical departments are mostly from official and wealthy families, while those in social sciences are from worker and peasant families." In this situation, more than 77% of worker and peasant students rely on loans to get by.

_Borba_ revealed that by the end of this year, Yugoslavia will have 420,000 graduates without jobs. Under the revisionist rule of the Tito traitor clique, a vast number of Yugoslav students face the grim prospect of unemployment upon graduation. According to a leader of the Yugoslav Federal Executive Council, not only will this year's tens of thousands of graduates not find jobs, but in the next three years, another 380,000 graduates will also be without work.

    铁托集团倒行逆施，青年学生苦难重重
    从南修报刊透露的材料看南斯拉夫学生的困难处境
    经济恶化生活艰难
    铁托叛徒集团在南斯拉夫强行推行全面复辟资本主义的“经济改革”，使国内经济情况大为恶化。生活在修正主义统治下的南斯拉夫广大学生生活十分艰难。南修《战斗报》最近承认，早在一九六四年，“学生的浅浅的口袋就遭受了首次打击”，之后“随着经济改革而来的是第二次打击。”实施铁托集团的“经济改革”后，“住在学生宿舍里的学生生活费用增加了大约百分之七十，而对于其他学生则几乎增加一倍。”
    不仅生活费用大大上涨，而且不少地方还大量削减学生助学金。据这家南修报纸透露，“助学金越来越难于获得，近来越来越多的是为有钱的和有势力的父母的子女所获得。共和国的学生贷款基金连在大城市里学习和生活所必需的费用的半数都达不到”。因此，“有些人将考虑自己的物质问题甚于学业。”
    工农子女受尽排挤
    在今天南修统治下的大学里，一些特权阶层和高级职员的子女享受着种种特殊待遇，而工农子女则受尽排挤，生活困苦。据南修《战斗报》透露，在贝尔格莱德大学学生中，工人出身的子女在一九六二年占百分之十五点一，而到一九六七年，下降到百分之十二点四。在卢布尔雅那大学，百分之四十九的学生出身于所谓职员（即一小撮特权阶层）家庭，工人家庭出身的学生只占百分之二十，农民家庭出身的只有百分之八。
    在分配助学金方面，技术院系的学生拿到的助学金要比社会科学和师范院系的学生多得多。这是因为“在技术院系学习的是职员和荷包较深的人的子女，而学习社会科学的则是工农家庭的子女。”在这种情况下，工农子女中间百分之七十七以上都是靠借贷过日。
    毕业即失业
    南修《战斗报》透露，到今年年底，南斯拉夫“将有四十二万持有文凭的青年人没有工作。”在铁托叛徒集团的修正主义统治下，南斯拉夫广大学生面临着毕业即失业的悲惨命运。据南修联邦执行委员会一个头目供认，不仅今年解决不了这几十万毕业生的失业问题，而且在今后三年内，还有三十八万毕业生的工作没有着落。
