The revolutionary committees of Heilongjiang Province and Tianjin Municipality have decided to present each household of poor and lower-middle peasants with a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," "The Three Articles," and a portrait of Chairman Mao. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have joyously shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, June 14—The revolutionary committee of Heilongjiang Province has recently decided to present each household of poor and lower-middle peasants in the province with a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," "The Three Articles," and "Songs of Quotations from Chairman Mao." This great event has pushed the mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's thoughts to a new stage.

On the day of presenting the revolutionary classics of Chairman Mao to the poor and lower-middle peasants, the entire province was filled with joy. Various places held grand ceremonies to present the books. Whenever the decorated trucks loaded with revolutionary classics arrived in the countryside, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, seeing the long-awaited works of Chairman Mao, were so excited that they repeatedly raised their fists and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!" The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants firmly declared: "Above all, the most important thing is to study and apply Chairman Mao's thoughts. Among all treasures, Chairman Mao's revolutionary classics are the most precious. We must pass down Chairman Mao's revolutionary classics from generation to generation."

All levels of revolutionary committees in the province have regarded presenting Chairman Mao's works to the poor and lower-middle peasants as a highly important political task, with a strong sense of political responsibility and enthusiasm, they have devoted themselves to this work. Many leading members of the revolutionary committees personally participated in presenting the revolutionary classics to the poor and lower-middle peasants. The revolutionary workers of the Xinhua Bookstore and the transportation departments have, with full revolutionary enthusiasm, delivered the revolutionary classics to the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants at the fastest speed.

After receiving Chairman Mao's works, the poor and lower-middle peasants in various places enthusiastically engaged in activities to praise the great leader Chairman Mao, to praise the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and to praise Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. At the same time, they launched a thorough criticism of the heinous crimes committed by the Chinese Khrushchev in opposing and resisting the poor and lower-middle peasants' study of Chairman Mao's works.

Through extensive praise and criticism, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have further strengthened their boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and deepened their intense hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev. Many poor and lower-middle peasants stood before Chairman Mao's portrait and swore: "We will never forget to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought at every moment. We will follow Chairman Mao in revolution from generation to generation and turn our families into red schools of Mao Zedong Thought."

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, June 14—The revolutionary committee of Tianjin Municipality has recently presented each household of poor and lower-middle peasants in the suburbs with a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," "The Three Articles," and a portrait of Chairman Mao. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants were overjoyed and extremely excited. They held high the portrait of Chairman Mao and "Quotations from Chairman Mao," shouting joyously, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years! Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!"

When presenting the revolutionary classics of Chairman Mao and the portrait of Chairman Mao to the poor and lower-middle peasants, each people's commune held grand ceremonies. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, with boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, declared: Chairman Mao is our great savior, Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline, and it is our guiding light for progress. We must read Chairman Mao's books for life, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We will defend Chairman Mao, defend Mao Zedong Thought, and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line with our lives. Many poor and lower-middle peasants angrily denounced the heinous crimes committed by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Tianjin in fiercely opposing the poor and lower-middle peasants' study of Mao Zedong Thought. They said, the Chinese Khrushchev opposes us studying Mao Zedong Thought, but we will study it even more diligently and apply it even more thoroughly, studying it every day, applying it in everything, and everywhere. Not only will we study and apply it well ourselves, but we will also educate our children to study and apply it well, passing down the invincible Mao Zedong Thought from generation to generation.

After receiving the revolutionary classics and the portrait of Chairman Mao, many poor and lower-middle peasants recalled the bitterness of the old society and the sweetness of the new society with their families in front of Chairman Mao's portrait. They declared that they would definitely remember the great teaching of the great leader Chairman Mao, "Never forget class struggle," and carry out a thorough and sustained criticism of the revolution, thoroughly criticizing and exposing the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Tianjin. They will strive to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They will push the mass movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought to new heights and turn the vast rural areas of the suburbs into red schools of Mao Zedong Thought.
