The struggle of Yugoslav students against the reactionary policies of the Tito clique continues to develop. The Tito clique is terrified and is further playing the counter-revolutionary two-handed game of suppression and deception, attempting to strangle the student struggle.

	NEW DELHI, June 7 (Xinhua) — Students at the University of Belgrade continued their occupation of the university on June 5 and 6, despite the suppression and deception by the Tito clique. They held meetings to strongly denounce the reactionary policies of the Tito clique and their crimes of restoring capitalism. They angrily condemned the savage suppression of the student struggle by the South Slav authorities and demanded the release of students who were illegally arrested. They demanded severe punishment for those who suppressed the students and for the responsible officials of the Belgrade Radio, newspapers, and the Yugoslav News Agency who distorted the reports on the student struggle. They demanded the abolition of the unreasonable ban on parades and assemblies and the withdrawal of police from the university. On June 5, students also posted many new slogans around the school, reading: "Workers and students oppose fake socialism!" "We do not want the restoration of capitalism!" Some slogans also called on workers to rise up against the reactionary rule of the Tito clique. Students also wrote their demands on big-character posters and posted them on the streets, and many citizens of Belgrade came to read them.

	The struggle of the students at the University of Belgrade is spreading to various parts of Yugoslavia. In recent days, students in Sarajevo, Ljubljana, Skopje, Mostar, Rijeka, Prilep, and other cities have held meetings and demonstrations in support of the just actions of the students in Belgrade. On June 5, after holding a support meeting, students at the University of Sarajevo defied the ban on parades by the South Slav police authorities and held a demonstration within the school. The South Slav authorities in Sarajevo, enraged and embarrassed, maliciously slandered the students' actions as "riots" and "hooliganism," and unreasonably declared the "Student Action Committee" of the University of Sarajevo as "illegal," which further enraged the students. On the same day, more than a thousand students at the University of Zagreb held a meeting in support of the students in Belgrade. They sang the "Internationale" and shouted slogans such as "We support our comrades in Belgrade!" "Their demands are our demands!" At the meeting, two representatives from the University of Belgrade reported on the struggle of the students in the capital against the reactionary rule of the South Slavs. It is reported that students in Zagreb and Skopje also sent representatives to Belgrade to connect with the revolution.

	The South Slav ruling clique, terrified of the revolutionary struggle of the students, is using various tricks to try to extinguish the flames of the progressive student movement. The South Slav authorities not only sealed off the University of Belgrade and ordered the ban on student meetings and parades but also unreasonably closed the university newspaper "Student Newspaper" on June 5 and announced that students were not allowed to print and distribute leaflets. They also threatened to investigate "hostile elements" and arrest "provocateurs." On the evening of June 6, the South Slav ruling clique viciously announced that they would take "measures" against those "engaging in hostile activities" according to the law.

	While carrying out large-scale suppression, the Tito clique is also constantly playing the trick of deception. They talk about "improving" the material conditions of students, "agree" to some of the students' demands, and try to sow discord among the students to split and disintegrate the student ranks. This further exposes the ferocious and cunning face of the Tito clique in suppressing the student struggle.

    反对假社会主义！  不要资本主义复辟！
    南斯拉夫学生反抗铁托集团反动政策的斗争继续发展
    铁托集团怕得要死，进一步玩弄镇压和欺骗的反革命两手，妄图扼杀学生斗争
    新华社七日讯　贝尔格莱德消息：南斯拉夫大学生不顾铁托叛徒集团的镇压和欺骗，继续开展反抗铁托集团反动政策的斗争。
    贝尔格莱德大学的学生五日和六日继续占领着大学。他们纷纷举行集会，强烈抨击铁托集团的反动政策和复辟资本主义的罪行，愤怒谴责南修当局野蛮镇压学生斗争的暴行。他们坚决要求释放被无理逮捕的学生，严厉惩办镇压学生的凶手和歪曲报道学生斗争的贝尔格莱德电台、报纸和南斯拉夫通讯社的负责人；要求取消禁止游行集会的无理规定，并撤走封锁大学的警察。五日，学生们还在学校周围张贴了许多新的标语，上面写着：“工人和学生反对假社会主义！”“我们不要资本主义复辟！”有些标语还呼吁工人起来反抗铁托集团的反动统治。学生们还把他们的要求写成了大字报张贴在大街上，许多贝尔格莱德市民纷纷前往阅读。
    贝尔格莱德大学生的斗争烈火正在向南斯拉夫各地扩展。连日来，萨拉热窝、卢布尔雅那、斯科普里、摩斯塔、里耶卡、普里列普等城市的学生相继举行集会和示威游行，声援贝尔格莱德大学生的正义行动。五日，萨拉热窝大学学生举行声援集会后，不顾南修警察当局禁止游行的命令，在校内举行了示威游行。萨拉热窝的南修当局恼羞成怒，竟诬蔑学生的行动是“骚乱”、“流氓行为”等等，并无理宣布萨拉热窝大学“大学生行动委员会”为“非法”，这就更加激起了学生们的愤怒。同一天，萨格勒布大学的一千多人举行了声援贝尔格莱德大学生的集会。他们高唱《国际歌》，高呼：“我们支持贝尔格莱德的同学！”“他们的要求就是我们的要求！”等口号。会上，有两名贝尔格莱德大学的学生代表介绍了首都大学生向南修反动统治展开斗争的情况。据报道，萨格勒布和斯科普里的学生还派代表到贝尔格莱德进行革命串连。
    对学生的革命斗争怕得要死的南修统治集团，正在施展各种阴谋手段，千方百计地企图扑灭进步学生运动的烈火。南修当局不仅封锁了贝尔格莱德大学，下令禁止学生集会游行，五日，又无理封闭了贝尔格莱德大学校刊《大学生报》，宣布不准学生印刷和散发传单。他们还扬言要追查“敌对分子”，并要逮捕“挑衅分子”。六日晚，南修统治集团恶狠狠地宣布，将“根据法律”对“进行敌对活动”的人“采取措施”。
    铁托集团在大肆进行镇压的同时，又不断玩弄欺骗的一手。他们大谈什么要“改善”学生的物质条件，“答应”学生的一些要求，并在学生中竭力进行挑拨离间，企图分化瓦解学生队伍。这就进一步暴露了铁托叛徒集团镇压学生斗争的凶恶和狡猾的嘴脸。
