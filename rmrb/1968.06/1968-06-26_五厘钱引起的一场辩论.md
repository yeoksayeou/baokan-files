Recently, in Wangjiahougo Village, the Third Production Brigade of Yingshang Commune in Jimo County, Shandong, a heated debate was sparked by the issue of five fen (0.05 yuan).

The matter was as follows: The brigade had a shortage of fodder for livestock, and it was the busy agricultural season, making it impossible to spare labor to cut grass. The brigade committee decided to mobilize students to cut green grass during their spare time, offering a reward of five fen per jin (0.5 kg). After the decision was announced, two different opinions emerged among the commune members: One opinion was that mobilizing students to cut fodder should first emphasize proletarian politics, conduct education for revolutionary grass-cutting, and provide reasonable compensation. Without emphasizing proletarian politics and putting the "money" first, it would lead people down the wrong path of selfish individualism. The other opinion believed that five fen per jin of green grass was beneficial for both the brigade and the individuals. Students would be enthusiastic about the work, and the brigade would solve the problem of fodder shortage. This was a good thing. The debate over these two opinions attracted the attention of the brigade revolutionary committee.

One evening, the brigade leaders went to this brigade and, together with the cadres and commune members, studied Chairman Mao's great teachings on "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work" and "The basic task of political work is to constantly instill socialist ideology in the peasant masses and criticize capitalist tendencies." Following this, everyone engaged in a heated debate. Poor peasant commune member Liu Pingli said: Five fen seems like a small matter, but it plants a seed of "selfishness" in the students. This is not the path of emphasizing proletarian politics. China's Khrushchev wants to use the black goods of "material incentives" and "money as the commander," using the small benefits under one's nose to lure us down the capitalist path, using "selfishness" to corrupt our souls, and turn us into selfish individualists to achieve his evil goal of restoring capitalism. Following this, young commune member Liu Zhen said: "Five fen is a small matter, but the path we take is a big matter. 'Material incentives' and 'money as the commander' are the poisons that China's Khrushchev uses to harm us poor and lower-middle peasants. He wants to use these tricks to poison us, his heart is truly black! This small group of bad guys, mouthing 'material incentives' work quickly, 'can mobilize the enthusiasm of the commune members,' pfft, simply nonsense. Look at us under Chairman Mao's leadership, carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, insisting on proletarian politics as the commander, setting up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, implementing the Dazhai method of emphasizing proletarian politics in work points, we poor and lower-middle peasants have established the idea of farming for revolution, not caring about work points, not caring about compensation, and both agricultural and sideline productions have developed unprecedentedly. Can this be achieved by 'material incentives'?"

The debate became more intense, and the right and wrong became clearer. Those who originally wanted to use five fen to mobilize the enthusiasm for cutting grass also had an epiphany after the debate. They saw the struggle between the two lines from the five fen.

At this time, the brigade leader Lan Debao, who was sitting to the side, could no longer hold back after being enlightened by everyone. He excitedly said: "This debate over five fen gave me a vivid political lesson. In the past, although I also talked about grabbing politics, I always felt that it was not as important as grabbing production. As a result, the more I grabbed, the more passive I became, the more I grabbed, the more chaotic it became. Today's debate has unraveled the knot for me. It turns out that I grabbed everything but did not grab the fundamental issue of insisting on Mao Zedong Thought as the commander and emphasizing proletarian politics. My mind lacked class struggle. In the future, I will resolutely learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, lead the poor and lower-middle peasants to walk the path of emphasizing proletarian politics, thoroughly eliminate the poison of China's Khrushchev, and forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line."

### 五厘钱引起的一场辩论

    五厘钱引起的一场辩论
    最近，在山东即墨县营上公社王家后戈庄大队第三生产队里，为五厘钱引起了一场激烈的大辩论。
    事情是这样的：这个队里的牲口饲草不多了，眼下又是农忙季节，抽不出劳力去割饲草。队委会决定发动学生在课余时间割青草，每斤奖给五厘钱。决定公布以后，在社员中出现了两种不同的意见：一种意见是，发动学生割饲草首先要突出无产阶级政治，进行为革命割草的教育，并给以合理报酬。不突出无产阶级政治，“钱”字当头，是把人们往自私自利的个人主义邪路上领。另一种意见认为，五厘钱一斤青草，队里和个人都有利，学生干的有劲，队里也解决了牲口饲草的不足，是件好事。这两种意见的争论，引起了大队革委会的重视。
    一天晚上，大队领导同志，到这个队里和干部、社员一起学习了毛主席关于“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”和“政治工作的基本任务是向农民群众不断地灌输社会主义思想，批评资本主义倾向”的伟大教导。接着，大家展开了热烈的辩论。贫农社员刘平礼说：五厘钱乍看起来是小事，可它给学生种下的是一条“私”根，这和突出无产阶级政治走的不是一条路。中国赫鲁晓夫就是想用“金钱挂帅”、“物质刺激”这套黑货，用眼皮底下的一点点小利，引诱我们走资本主义邪道，用“私”字腐蚀咱们的灵魂，想使咱变成自私自利的个人主义者，来达到他复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。接着，青年社员刘振说：“五厘钱事小，走什么路子的事大。‘物质刺激’、
  ‘金钱挂帅’是中国赫鲁晓夫毒害咱贫下中农的砒霜。他想利用这些鬼名堂，毒害我们，心真黑啊！这一小撮坏家伙，口口声声
  ‘物质刺激’见效快，‘能调动社员的生产积极性’，呸，简直是胡说八道。看咱们在毛主席领导下，搞起了文化大革命，坚持无产阶级政治挂帅，大办毛泽东思想学习班，推行大寨的突出无产阶级政治记工法，咱贫下中农树立了为革命种田的思想，不计较工分，不计较报酬，农副业生产都空前大发展，这靠‘物质刺激’能办到吗！”
    辩论越来越热烈，是非越来越分明。原来想靠五厘钱调动割草积极性的人，经过辩论也恍然大悟。他们从五厘钱里看到了两条路线的斗争。
    这时，坐在一旁的生产队长兰德宝在大家的启发下，憋不住了。他激动地说：“这五厘钱的辩论会，给我上了一堂生动的政治课。过去我嘴里虽然也说抓政治，可作起来老觉得不如抓生产要紧，结果越抓越被动，越抓越乱，今天的辩论会，给我解开了疙瘩。原来我千抓万抓，就是没抓住坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，突出无产阶级政治这个根本，头脑里缺少了阶级斗争。今后我决心活学活用毛泽东思想，带领贫下中农走突出无产阶级政治的道路，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫的流毒，永远忠于毛主席的革命路线。”
