The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Coal Bureau are closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and intensifying class struggle. They are launching fierce and sustained attacks on class enemies, significantly raising their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. This has created a vibrant revolutionary scene on the Beijing coal industry front. Driven by the revolution, production has steadily increased, and high-yield records have been continuously set, fully demonstrating the immense power of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In May, the total coal production of the bureau increased by 16.37% compared to April, and the tunneling progress increased by 14%, exceeding the state production plan.

Since February of this year, all factories and mines under the Beijing Coal Bureau have established revolutionary committees. The newly formed revolutionary committees have placed the study and application of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all work, establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and taking class struggle as the key to fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. In mid-March, the bureau held a series of meetings from the bottom up to discuss the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionary workers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary family members have deepened their proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, increased their awareness of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and strengthened their efforts in revolution and production.

Recently, the great leader Chairman Mao taught us: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat under the conditions of socialism to overthrow the bourgeoisie and all other exploiting classes, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its leadership and the broad revolutionary masses of the people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." This extremely great instruction by Chairman Mao has greatly inspired the coal miners in the capital. The entire mine immediately took studying Chairman Mao's latest instruction as the central task, establishing various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. So far, four-thirds of the members of various levels of revolutionary committees and revolutionary leading groups, and the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations have participated in the study classes. Through repeated study and deep understanding of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the broad revolutionary workers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary workers' families throughout the bureau have linked the actual situation of their units, carried out revolutionary criticism, and launched fierce attacks on Liu Shaoqi and the anti-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Committee led by Peng Zhen, as well as a handful of traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries, uncovering a group of hidden class enemies. This has greatly boosted the morale of the proletariat and crushed the arrogance of the bourgeoisie.

The bureau revolutionary committee also timely summarized and promoted the advanced experience of the Wuchengjian Coal Mine in carrying out revolutionary criticism, moving the battlefield of revolutionary criticism from the auditorium to the mine, workshop, and dormitory, and to the family area, forming a situation of "people's war" where everyone criticizes every day. They also combined revolutionary criticism with the current struggle tasks, with the reform of their units, and with self-criticism. Through revolutionary criticism, they thoroughly criticized Liu Shaoqi's entire set of counter-revolutionary revisionist lines, established a series of enterprise management systems with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, and thoroughly criticized anarchism, establishing a new order of revolution and production for the proletariat. The broad revolutionary workers have enhanced their revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline, adhering to the eight-hour workday system, and striving to improve work efficiency.

Recently, the glorious deeds of Comrade Men He have further inspired the miners fighting on the front lines of Chairman Mao. The revolutionary workers of the Mechanical and Electrical Section (Department) of the Wuchengjian Coal Mine recently changed the original plan of stopping production for three days to carry out maintenance to a plan of mining while maintaining. Forty-one revolutionary workers fought continuously for twenty-four hours and successfully completed the maintenance task. The production of the entire bureau has also seen a significant increase.

    全面落实毛主席最新指示狠抓阶级斗争
    北京煤炭战线革命生产越来越好
    据新华社三日讯　北京矿务局广大革命职工紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，狠抓阶级斗争，主动地持久地向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，大大提高了阶级斗争觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，使北京煤炭工业战线呈现出一片热气腾腾的革命景象。在革命的带动下，生产稳步上升，高产纪录联翩出现，充分显示了无产阶级文化大革命的无比威力。五月份，全局原煤产量比四月份提高百分之十六点三七，掘进进尺提高百分之十四，超额完成了国家生产计划。
    北京矿务局所属各厂、矿，在今年二月份全部成立了革命委员会。新生的革命委员会在成立以后，把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，大办毛泽东思想学习班，以阶级斗争为纲，全面落实毛主席的最新指示。三月中旬，全局自下而上地逐级召开了活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表会议。广大革命职工、革命干部和革命家属无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席的无产阶级感情越来越深，活学活用毛泽东思想的自觉性越来越高，抓革命、促生产的劲头越来越足。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”毛主席这一极其伟大的指示，极大地鼓舞了首都的煤矿工人。全矿立即以学习毛主席这一最新指示为中心内容，开办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。到目前为止，各级革命委员会和革命领导小组的成员，革命群众组织的负责人，已有四分之三参加过学习班。全局广大革命职工、革命干部和革命职工家属，通过反复学习、深刻领会毛主席的最新指示，联系本单位的实际，开展革命大批判，向中国赫鲁晓夫和旧北京市委彭真反革命修正主义集团及其在局、厂、矿的代理人，向一小撮叛徒、特务和反革命分子展开了猛烈的进攻，挖出了一批暗藏的阶级敌人。大长了无产阶级的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风。
    局革命委员会还及时总结和推广了木城涧煤矿开展革命大批判的先进经验，把革命大批判的战场，从礼堂搬到井下、车间和宿舍，搬到家属区，形成了人人批，天天批的“人民战争”的局面。他们还把大批判和当前的斗争任务相结合，和本单位的斗批改相结合，和斗私相结合。通过革命大批判，大破了中国赫鲁晓夫的一整套反革命修正主义路线，大立了闪烁着毛泽东思想光辉的社会主义办企业路线，建立了一系列企业管理制度；大破了无政府主义，大立了无产阶级的革命和生产的新秩序。广大革命职工增强了革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，坚持八小时工作制，努力提高工时利用率。
    最近，门合同志的光辉事迹，又进一步鼓舞了战斗在毛主席身边的广大矿工。木城涧煤矿机电连（科）的革命职工，最近在检修主井绞车的过程中，将原定停产三天进行检修的计划改为边出煤边检修。四十一名革命职工连续奋战二十四小时，胜利完成了检修任务。全局的生产也有大幅度上升。
