The United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and the "Malaysia" puppet regime of Rahman-Lee Kuan Yew held a meeting in Kuala Lumpur on the 10th and 11th of this month. They plotted to jointly suppress the national liberation struggles of the people in this region after the British withdraw their troops from Malaya (including Singapore) in 1971. According to the meeting's communiqué, the Rahman-Lee Kuan Yew puppet regime will significantly expand its military forces. Australia and New Zealand will continue to station troops in Malaya. The three countries of the UK, Australia, and New Zealand will firmly control the military of the Rahman-Lee Kuan Yew puppet regime.
