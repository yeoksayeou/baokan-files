When Israeli reinforcements approached under the cover of helicopters, the guerrillas killed and wounded another fifteen Israeli soldiers and shot down an enemy helicopter before safely returning to their base.

	The report said that "Fatah" guerrillas also destroyed a fuel station between Eilat and Borshba, causing a fire at the station. They also laid mines on a military road northeast of Jericho, blowing up an enemy vehicle and killing and wounding three enemy soldiers.
