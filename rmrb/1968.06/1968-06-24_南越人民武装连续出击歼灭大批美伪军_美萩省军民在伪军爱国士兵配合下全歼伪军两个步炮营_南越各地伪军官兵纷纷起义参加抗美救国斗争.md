In My Tho Province, Military and Civilians, with the Collaboration of Patriotic Soldiers from the Puppet Army, Completely Annihilate Two Puppet Infantry and Artillery Battalions

Puppet Soldiers Across South Vietnam Rise Up and Join the Anti-American, National Salvation Struggle

According to Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on the 21st, the People's Liberation Armed Forces in various provinces of South Vietnam have, since early June, launched continuous attacks, striking the enemy everywhere and annihilating large numbers of American and puppet forces.

According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the People's Liberation Armed Forces in My Tho Province bravely attacked the American and puppet military positions in My Tho City and its surroundings on the night of the 16th, annihilating over 1,200 enemy troops in one battle.

The report said that this attack was carried out with the cooperation of local residents and some patriotic soldiers within the puppet army. In this attack, the People's Liberation Armed Forces completely annihilated one puppet infantry battalion and one artillery battalion, severely damaged one puppet battalion and one American artillery company. In addition, the People's Liberation Armed Forces also burned down a weapons and ammunition depot and a fuel depot, and seized a large amount of military supplies.

From the 1st to the 13th, the People's Liberation Armed Forces in Kien Giang Province continuously attacked the enemy, annihilating over 700 enemy troops, shooting down or damaging 10 enemy aircraft, sinking one patrol boat, and destroying one M-113 armored vehicle.

From the 7th to the 15th, the People's Liberation Armed Forces in the northern part of Quang Tri Province launched consecutive attacks, annihilating 310 American invaders, destroying 24 military vehicles, one helicopter, and three cannons, demolishing seven fuel and ammunition depots, burning 180 barrels of fuel, and damaging one enemy ship.

From the 1st to the 7th, the People's Liberation Armed Forces in the southern part of Quang Nam Province continuously attacked the enemy in the Hon Nhan area, annihilating 432 American troops, including completely annihilating one enemy company, shooting down 19 enemy aircraft, and destroying one tank.

From the 6th to the 10th, the People's Liberation Armed Forces in Tuyen Duc Province continuously intercepted American troops "sweeping" through the areas of Suoi Kien and Suoi An, annihilating 340 enemy troops, destroying nine tanks and armored vehicles, shooting down five helicopters, and seizing many weapons and military supplies.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on the 23rd, under the brave attacks of the military and civilians in South Vietnam, more and more puppet soldiers are breaking away from the American and puppet clique, surrendering to the people. Among them, many have turned their guns against the American invaders and their puppets, joining the ranks of the anti-American, national salvation struggle.

In early May, over 900 puppet soldiers in Binh Dinh Province, led by a lieutenant colonel and three captains, abandoned their posts and turned their guns against the American invaders and the puppet regime.

From April 20th to May 15th, there were 13 uprisings by the Security Forces and Special Forces in Quang Nam Province. These patriotic puppet soldiers captured and annihilated 140 stubborn traitors, carrying a large amount of weapons and ammunition, and surrendering to the People's Liberation Armed Forces.

In My Tho Province, over 300 Security Forces members refused to carry out the order to take over the defense of the Fourth Highway. Many soldiers from the 12th Regiment of the 7th Division of the puppet army disobeyed the order to "sweep" the guerrilla forces. When the American and puppet officers attempted to force them to go to their deaths, the patriotic soldiers resolutely fought back.

    据新华社河内二十一日电　越南南方各省人民解放武装力量，六月初以来，接连出击，到处打击敌人，歼灭了大批美伪军。
    据越南南方解放通讯社报道，美萩省人民解放武装力量在十六日夜间，英勇袭击美萩市及其周围的美伪军阵地，一举歼敌一千二百多名。
    报道说，这次袭击是在当地居民和伪军中一些爱国士兵的配合下进行的。在这次袭击中，人民解放武装力量全歼伪军一个步兵营和一个炮兵营，重创一个伪军营和一个美军炮兵连。此外，人民解放武装力量还烧毁了一个武器弹药库和一个燃料库，并缴获了大量的军用物资。
    芹苴省人民解放武装力量在到十三日为止的九天中，连续进攻敌人，共歼敌七百多名，击落、击伤敌机十架，击沉战艇一艘，击毁M—113型装甲车一辆。
    广治省北部人民解放武装力量，七日、十三日、十四日和十五日接连出击，消灭美国侵略军三百一十名，击毁军车二十四辆、直升飞机一架和大炮三门，摧毁汽油库和弹药库七座，烧毁汽油一百八十桶，击伤敌船一艘。

    据新华社河内二十三日电　据这里报道，在越南南方军民的英勇打击下，越来越多的伪军官兵脱离美伪集团，向人民投诚，其中不少人反戈一击，把枪口转向美国侵略者及其走狗，加入抗美救国斗争的行列。
    五月初，槟椥省伪军官兵九百多人，在一名少校和三名中尉的率领下弃暗投明，把枪口转向美国侵略者和傀儡集团。
    在四月二十日到五月十五日期间，广南省发生了十三起保安队和别动队起义。这些爱国的伪军官兵追捕和消灭了一百四十名顽固不化的卖国贼，携带大量武器弹药，向人民解放武装力量投诚。
    在美萩省，三百多名保安队队员拒绝执行前往第四号公路接防的任务。伪军第七师第十二团的许多士兵违抗“扫荡”游击队的命令，当督阵的美国人和伪军官企图用武力驱使他们前去送死的时候，爱国士兵坚决地进行了反击。
