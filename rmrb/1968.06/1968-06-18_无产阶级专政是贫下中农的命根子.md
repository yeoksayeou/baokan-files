The dictatorship of the proletariat is the lifeline of poor and lower-middle peasants.

Liu Delu, Commander of the Militia Company, Hongqi Production Brigade, Yongfa Commune, Bayan County, Heilongjiang Province

China's Khrushchev, this sworn enemy of the dictatorship of the proletariat, has done countless evil deeds.

The state machine is clearly used to suppress the resistance of class enemies. This is the most basic common sense. However, China's Khrushchev, who claims to be an "old revolutionary," insists that "the state's repressive apparatus can be reduced" and that "the most important task of the state in the future is to organize social life." This is purely another bottle of "peaceful evolution" knockout drug! Does China's Khrushchev really want to "organize social life"? No! Not a thousand times no! Not ten thousand times no! His evil intent is to use this "organizing social life" as a cover to command his remnants, and all sorts of scoundrels to come out and attack us. He wants to "evolve" our proletarian state, which is in power, into a state of bourgeois dictatorship in their hands; to hand over the guns in our hands to the enemy, and then come to kill us. This is extremely reactionary! He deserves to die a thousand deaths!

In this regard, we have our own experiences. Before the Cultural Revolution, when China's Khrushchev blew the horn of the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" from above, his agents here used the pretext of focusing on production and construction to secretly abolish the people's dictatorship security organizations and the "supervision and reform groups" that poor and lower-middle peasants used to supervise and reform landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. They also suppressed the militia organization with production tasks. At that time, we felt that this did not conform to Chairman Mao's teaching that "at any time we must not forget class struggle and must not forget the dictatorship of the proletariat," and we fought resolutely against them. They did not listen and kept shouting that it was "orders from above," spreading smoke screens and talking nonsense about how "landlords and rich farmers have become honest," "there are the PLA for battles and the public security bureau for catching thieves, our task is to focus on production." In this way, they removed the rightist hat from a person who was originally quite reactionary. Once this person's rightist hat was removed, he became even more arrogant. First, he occupied our political and ideological positions and spread pornographic novels. Then, taking advantage of the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, he raised the banner of "revolution" to occupy our people's dictatorship security organization and seized the power of the production team's "supervision and reform group" leader again. He even dared to label two poor peasant members as "four-category elements" and put them under control. Look! Isn't this allowing landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to pick up our guns and attack us poor and lower-middle peasants? If this continues, won't the socialist mountains and rivers that the great leader Chairman Mao led us to seize turn back into the domain of landlords, capitalists, and the Kuomintang reactionaries? How evil is the wolfish ambition of this China's Khrushchev!

Chairman Mao said: "The rights obtained by the people must not be easily lost and must be defended by struggle." Only by actively attacking class enemies can we defend the proletarian helm. During the Cultural Revolution, poor and lower-middle peasants tightened the line of class struggle, and the Revolutionary Committee led the revolutionary masses to launch a fierce attack on class enemies. All the plots of class enemies to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat became bubbles. China's Khrushchev's "theory of the extinction of class struggle" and his nonsense about "the most important task of the state in the future is to organize social life" were all thoroughly criticized by us. The landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who had not been reformed were fought by us poor and lower-middle peasants until they lost their souls and spirits. The "four-category elements," traitors, spies, and remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries who had been hiding for many years were all dug out. The poisonous snakes that had disguised themselves as beauties and burrowed into our livers were all exposed under the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought. "Class struggle, once grasped, works wonders." Production also saw a sharp increase. Last year, we leaped over the "Outline" from a backward base. All these things didn't give China's Khrushchev a resounding and crisp slap in the face?

We poor and lower-middle peasants have tasted the bitterness of having no power and the sweetness of having power, and we deeply know that the dictatorship of the proletariat is the lifeline of poor and lower-middle peasants. We must never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat from generation to generation and must definitely build the Revolutionary Committee into a battle command post that leads the masses to launch unremitting attacks on the enemy, as instructed by Chairman Mao, and carry out the "political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes" to the end. Let China's Khrushchev's "theory of the extinction of class struggle" go to hell with China's Khrushchev!

    无产阶级专政是贫下中农的命根子
    黑龙江省巴彦县永发公社红星大队民兵连长　刘德录
    中国赫鲁晓夫这个无产阶级专政的死对头，干尽了坏事。
    国家这架大机器，明明是用来镇压阶级敌人的反抗的，这是最起码的常识。可是，自奉为“老革命”的堂堂的中国赫鲁晓夫，却硬说“国家专政的机构可以缩小了”、“今后国家最重要的任务是组织社会生活”。这纯粹装的是又一葫芦“和平演变”的蒙汗药！中国赫鲁晓夫真的是要“组织社会生活”了吗？不是！一千个不是！一万个不是！他的贼心是要在这个“组织社会生活”的大幌子下，指挥他的残兵败将，鱼鳖虾蟹一齐跑出来，向我们进攻。把我们无产阶级当权执政的国家“演变”到他们手里去，变成资产阶级专政的国家；把拿在我们手里的刀枪双手交给敌人，再来杀我们的头。真是反动透顶！罪该万死！
    在这上，我们是有体会的。文化大革命以前，中国赫鲁晓夫在上边一吹“阶级斗争熄灭”论的喇叭筒，他在我们这里的代理人，就以抓生产、搞建设为名，把群众专政的治安保卫组织，贫下中农监督改造地富反坏右分子的“监改小组”，都偷偷摸摸地给“取缔”了，把民兵组织也硬用生产任务给压了。当时我们就感到这不符合毛主席“任何时候都不可忘记阶级斗争，不可忘记无产阶级专政”的教导，同他们进行了坚决的斗争。他们不服，一个劲叫嚷是“上边的指示”，还大放烟幕弹，胡说什么“地主富农老实了”，“打仗有解放军，抓小偷有公安局，咱们的任务就是搞生产”。这样，把一个本来还很反动的右派分子，也给摘掉了帽子。这个家伙的右派帽子一摘，就更猖狂起来了。先是把我们的政治思想阵地，占了过去，大讲黄色小说。接着，乘文化大革命刚一开始之机，打着“革命”旗号，把我们群众专政的治安保卫组织，也占了过去，把生产队“监改小组”组长的大权又抓到手里。还竟胆大包天地把两个贫农社员给打成“四类分子”管制起来了。你看！这不明明是让地富反坏右分子，再拿起我们手里的刀枪，向我们贫下中农进攻吗？照此下去，伟大领袖毛主席带领我们打下的社会主义江山岂不又变成了地主、资本家、国民党反动派的天下吗？这个中国赫鲁晓夫的狼子野心有多么恶毒啊！
    毛主席说：“人民得到的权利，绝不允许轻易丧失，必须用战斗来保卫。”也只有主动向阶级敌人进攻，才能保卫住无产阶级的印把子。文化大革命中，贫下中农把阶级斗争这条纲拉得崩崩紧，革命委员会领导革命群众向阶级敌人猛轰的战斗一打响，阶级敌人颠覆无产阶级专政的一切阴谋，就都成了泡影。中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，“今后国家最重要的任务是组织社会生活”的鬼话，统统被我们批得臭不可闻。没有改造好的地富反坏右分子，被我们贫下中农斗得丢魂丧胆，暗藏多年的“四类分子”、叛徒、特务和国民党反动派的残渣余孽，都一个个地被挖出来，打扮成美女，钻进我们肝脏里的毒蛇，也都暴露在毛泽东思想的光天化日之下。“阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”生产也来了个猛增。去年一年，我们就在落后的底子上跨过了“纲要”。所有这些，不又给了中国赫鲁晓夫一个又响又脆的大耳光子吗！
    我们贫下中农吃透了没权的苦，饱尝了有权的甜，深知无产阶级专政是贫下中农的命根子。我们要世世代代不忘无产阶级专政，一定照毛主席指示把革命委员会建设成率领群众，不停顿地向敌人猛烈进攻的战斗司令部，把“无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命”进行到底。让中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，同中国赫鲁晓夫一道见鬼去吧！
