The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The reform of state organs, the most fundamental point, is to link up with the masses." As a member of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the factory to support the left, I have personally witnessed the touching fact of the revolutionary cadres and the masses being united as one. This has made me deeply realize that the revolutionary committee formed by the "three-in-one combination" has a solid mass base, which is the authority of the proletarian revolution.

The director of the revolutionary committee of this factory, Han Renjun, is an ordinary worker. After joining the leading cadre of the "three-in-one combination," he always remembers Chairman Mao's teaching: "Communists are not to be officials, but to make revolution." He strictly demands of himself and maintains the character of the working class.

After Han Renjun took up the post of director of the factory revolutionary committee, he still lived in a place that served both as an office and a dormitory. Day and night, he handled various problems raised by the workshops. The workers affectionately said: "Little Han is our service person for revolution and production during the day, and our voluntary duty officer at night."

One night, the telephone rang. Han Renjun picked up the phone and heard an old worker say: "My wife is seriously ill, and our place is far from the hospital. Please arrange a car to send her to the hospital." Han Renjun immediately thought of Chairman Mao's teaching: "All revolutionary comrades must care for, love, and help each other." With deep class feelings for the old worker, he found a way to solve the car problem and sent the old worker's wife to the hospital. The old worker was very moved and expressed his gratitude repeatedly.

Han Renjun returned to the office, and his heart was restless for a long time. He thought: Before I took up the post of the revolutionary committee director, I had also found a tricycle for a sick person, and the workers did not feel guilty. Everyone thought it was a matter of course. Tonight, I helped my class brother out of the feelings of a worker, why did he feel so guilty? Is it because I have become an official, and the old worker treats me as an official? So, he further examined himself and found that in recent times, he had more meetings and less time in the workshops, and less contact with the workers. If this continued, there would be a danger of alienation from the masses. He rang the alarm for himself: The position has changed, but the feelings of the working class must not change. He made a firm decision that in the future, he must often go down to participate in labor, humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, and never alienate himself from the masses.

Because Han Renjun's relationship with the workers became closer and closer, the workers could reflect their opinions to him in time. Once, Han Renjun just went down to the workshop to work, and the workers immediately raised their opinions to him: The work and rest schedule recently formulated by the revolutionary committee is not very reasonable. The morning is relatively cool, and the work time should be longer, while the afternoon is relatively hot, and the work time can be relatively shorter. Han Renjun also felt from his own experience of labor that day that this opinion was correct, so he reflected it to the revolutionary committee. The revolutionary committee immediately made amendments, thinking that this work and rest schedule was not bad. However, the workers reflected to him again: The two hours of power outage in the morning were all arranged as downtime, which was not in line with the actual situation, because some workshops did not necessarily use electricity for production. Thus, the work and rest schedule underwent another amendment, and finally, the arrangement of the work and rest time was both conducive to production and conducive to the workers' rest. Many members of the revolutionary committee deeply felt: If it were not for the close connection between the revolutionary mass representatives and the masses, how could the workers' opinions be reflected so quickly, and how could the problems be solved so timely? Han Renjun also deeply felt: Three adjustments were the process of his breaking away from selfishness and transforming his worldview. Each adjustment made his heart closer to the masses, and each adjustment made his thought of serving the people completely and thoroughly more.

Because Han Renjun was so closely connected with the masses, he had many eyes and many ears. Therefore, he not only understood the problems of the masses' production and life clearly, but more importantly, he could timely grasp the pulse of class struggle, always be aware of the new trends and characteristics of class struggle, and thus closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and attack the class enemy firmly, accurately, and fiercely.

Han Renjun's vivid deeds of being united with the masses have educated me and helped me further understand that Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the revolutionary committee are very wise. In the revolutionary committee formed by the "three-in-one combination," the participation of the new emerging excellent elements of the proletarian revolutionary mass representatives makes the revolutionary committee have a solid mass base, which is convenient for maintaining a broader and closer connection with the people, convenient for listening to the opinions and demands of the masses more timely and directly, and convenient for accepting the supervision of the masses. In this way, the revolutionary committee can be ensured to be a revolutionary, authoritative, and vigorous power organ of the proletariat, and can always maintain revolutionary youth, becoming a strong and powerful command post for attacking the class enemy.

    永远和群众血肉相联
    解放军驻济南机车工厂支左人员　董文秀
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”我作为人民解放军驻厂的支左人员，亲眼看见参加“三结合”的革命群众代表和群众血肉相联的感人的事实，使我深刻体会到：“三结合”的革命委员会，有了牢固的群众基础，才有无产阶级的革命权威。
    这个厂的革命委员会主任韩仁俊，是一个普通工人，他参加“三结合”的领导班子以后，始终牢记毛主席的“共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命”的教导，严格要求自己，保持着工人阶级的本色。
    韩仁俊从担任厂革命委员会主任以后，仍住在既是办公室又是宿舍的地方，白天黑夜随时处理车间提出来的各种问题。职工们亲切地说：小韩白天是我们厂革命和生产的服务员，夜间是我们的义务值班员。
    一天深夜，电话铃响了，小韩接过电话，听到一位老工人说：“我老伴有急病，住处离医院很远，请求派汽车送往医院。”小韩立刻想起了毛主席的教导：“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”他怀着对老工人深厚的阶级感情，想法给解决了汽车问题，把老工人的妻子送到了医院。那位老工人非常感动，连声表示感谢。
    小韩回到办公室，心里久久不能平静。他想：我没有担任革委会主任以前，也曾为病人找过三轮车，工人也没有过意不去，大家都觉得这是分内的事。今夜，我本着一个工人的感情，帮助自己的阶级弟兄，为什么他会这样地过意不去？是不是因为自己有了“官气”，老工人把自己当“官”看待？于是，他进一步检查自己，发现最近一段时间，开会时间多一些，深入车间少一些，和工人接触少了，这样下去，就有脱离群众的危险。他给自己敲起了警钟：地位变了，工人阶级的感情万万不能变。他下定决心，今后一定要经常下去参加劳动，虚心地听取群众的意见，永远不脱离群众。
    由于小韩和工人的关系越来越密切，工人有什么意见都能及时反映给他。有一次，小韩刚下到车间劳动，工人们就向他提开了意见：革委会最近订的作息时间表不大合理，上午天气较凉，工作时间应长一些，下午天气较热，工作时间可以相对缩短一些。小韩从自己一天劳动的切身体验中，也觉得这个意见很对，便向革委会反映。革委会马上作了修改，满以为这张时间表不错了。可是，工人又向他反映说：把上午两个钟头的停电时间一律都作为停产时间来安排，是不符合实际的，因为有的车间生产不一定用电。这样，作息时间表又经过了一次修改，终于使作息时间的安排既有利于生产，又有利于工人休息。革委会许多委员深有感触地说：要不是革命群众代表和群众有这样密切的联系，工人的意见怎么能这样快地反映上来，解决问题怎么能这样及时？小韩也深有感触地说：三次改点，是自己三破私字改造世界观的过程，每改一次点，就觉得自己的心和群众贴紧一点，每改一次点，就觉得完全、彻底为人民服务的思想又多一点。
    小韩和群众有这样密切的联系，他就有了许多的眼睛，许多的耳朵，因此他不仅对群众生产、群众生活等问题了解得清楚，更重要的是他能及时摸到阶级斗争的脉搏，随时洞察到阶级斗争的新动向、新特点，因而能够紧紧跟上毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢地掌握斗争大方向，又稳又准又狠地向阶级敌人进攻。
    小韩和群众血肉相联的生动事迹，教育了我，帮助我进一步认识到毛主席关于革命委员会好的最新指示是十分英明的。在“三结合”的革命委员会中，有新涌现出来的无产阶级的优秀分子革命群众代表参加，这就使革命委员会有了坚实的群众基础，便于同人民群众保持更广泛、更密切的联系，便于更及时更直接地听取群众的意见和要求，更便于接受群众的监督。这样，就可以保证革命委员会成为革命的、有无产阶级权威的、朝气蓬勃的权力机构，就可以使革命委员会永葆革命青春，成为向阶级敌人进攻的坚强有力的战斗指挥部。
