The report said that in the afternoon of June 20, the Liberation Army artillery launched a fierce attack on the Dong Ha U.S. military base. The shells accurately hit many important enemy targets, including the enemy's airfield, artillery positions, logistics area, and the command center of the U.S. Marine Corps' 3rd Division. The entire base became a sea of fire, with flames reaching hundreds of meters high, and people 10 kilometers away could hear the explosions. That night, the fire continued to burn, and the U.S. military airfield was completely paralyzed.

At dawn on June 18, the Liberation Army divided its forces into multiple routes and simultaneously launched a fierce attack on the U.S. Marine Corps' 4th Division, 3rd Battalion's base in the Da Nang area southeast of Richon. As soon as the battle began, the Liberation Army infantry used submachine guns, hand grenades, and hand bombs to destroy one enemy firepoint after another and quickly captured some enemy positions.

The enemy, caught off guard by such a surprise attack, panicked and hastily called in many aircraft for reinforcement, attempting to counterattack.
