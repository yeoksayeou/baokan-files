	Heartily Congratulate the Birth of the Chongqing Municipal Revolutionary Committee

	“Sichuan has great prospects!”

	Following the establishment of the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Committee, the Chongqing Municipal Revolutionary Committee has been born in the midst of fierce class struggle! This is another great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, another great victory for Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line! We are filled with boundless excitement and extend our warmest congratulations to all the military and civilian personnel of Chongqing!

	Chongqing is a key city in southwest China, an important industrial city in the great socialist motherland’s rear, and a crucial hub for water and land transportation in the Southwest. It has a powerful working class. The establishment of the Chongqing Municipal Revolutionary Committee is of great significance for China’s socialist revolution and socialist construction, for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, and for strengthening national defense.

	Before liberation, Chongqing was the center of the counter-revolutionary rule of the American Kuomintang bandits. Under the white terror of the counter-revolutionaries, the people of Chongqing had waged heroic and touching struggles against the evil Kuomintang reactionaries. In this unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, the proletarian revolutionary factions of Chongqing, with a glorious revolutionary tradition, and the broad revolutionary masses, with the strong support of the People’s Liberation Army, have engaged in fierce struggles and repeated confrontations with the Chinese Khrushchev and other top capitalist-roaders within the party and their agents in the Southwest, Sichuan, and Chongqing, as well as the remnants of the Kuomintang. They have finally achieved decisive victory in the proletarian cultural revolution in Chongqing. The establishment of the Chongqing Municipal Revolutionary Committee adds new luster to the excellent situation of the nationwide proletarian cultural revolution. All revolutionary comrades should enthusiastically cherish, support, and help it to develop, consolidate, and perfect continuously.

	We hope that the Chongqing Municipal Revolutionary Committee will unite and lead the broad revolutionary masses, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao’s great strategic deployment, continue to focus on class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, resolutely oppose right opportunism, right splitism, and right capitulationism, smash the rightist reversal of verdicts wind, unite all revolutionary forces, and launch fierce attacks on the handful of enemies of the proletariat without stopping; further develop and consolidate revolutionary great alliances and revolutionary three-in-one combinations by system, by industry, and by class; better “grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness for war,” and bravely fight for the comprehensive victory of the proletarian cultural revolution!

    本报评论员
    “四川很有希望”！
    继四川省革命委员会成立之后，重庆市革命委员会在剧烈的阶级斗争风暴中光荣地诞生了！这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的又一伟大胜利！我们以无限兴奋的心情，向重庆市全体军民表示热烈的祝贺！
    重庆是我国的西南重镇，是我们伟大社会主义祖国大后方的重要工业城市，是大西南水陆交通的枢纽。这里有强大的工人阶级。重庆市革命委员会的成立，对我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业，对巩固无产阶级专政和加强国防，具有重大意义。
    解放前，重庆曾经是美蒋匪帮反革命统治的中心。在反革命的白色恐怖下，重庆市人民曾经和万恶的国民党反动派作过可歌可泣的英勇斗争。在这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，有着光荣革命传统的重庆市无产阶级革命派和广大革命人民群众，在支左人民解放军的强力支持下，同中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派及其在西南、四川和重庆的代理人，同国民党的残渣余孽进行了激烈的搏斗和反复较量，终于取得了重庆市无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。重庆市革命委员会的成立，为全国无产阶级文化大革命节节胜利的大好形势增添了新的光彩。一切革命同志应该热情地爱护它，支持它，帮助它不断地发展、巩固和完善。
    希望重庆市革命委员会紧紧团结和带领广大革命群众，更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，继续狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争，坚决反对右倾机会主义，右倾分裂主义，右倾投降主义，粉碎右倾翻案风，团结一切革命力量，不停顿地向一小撮无产阶级的敌人展开猛烈的进攻；进一步发展和巩固按系统、按行业、按班级的革命大联合和革命三结合；更好地“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而英勇战斗！
