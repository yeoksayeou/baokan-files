About two thousand workers from Tokyo's San'ya slum district, enraged by the unjust suppression by the armed police of the reactionary Sato government in Japan, held a massive rally and demonstration on the evening of the 17th to protest against the savage rule and ruthless exploitation of capitalism.

	Workers in the San'ya slum district have bravely fought in this way nine times during the summer over the past ten years.

	On the evening of the 17th, workers from the San'ya slum district gathered in front of a police station in the district, holding high red flags with slogans such as "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought!" and "Smash Japanese Communist Party Revisionism!" They held a rally. Worker representatives at the rally strongly condemned the armed police for suppressing workers and exposed the ugly faces of the Japanese Communist Party revisionist clique in sabotaging the revolutionary struggle of the San'ya workers, splitting the workers' movement, and serving the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. A worker representative emphasized at the meeting that the anti-American patriotic struggle must be carried through to the end.

	After the rally, the workers marched around the police station and shouted slogans such as "Liberate San'ya!" and "Smash the police station!"

	The reactionary Sato government was terrified of the workers' brave struggle and ordered the police to attack the demonstrators. The enraged workers surrounded the police and set fire to the police station.

	Under the brave counterattack of the workers, the reactionary Sato government hastily dispatched armored vehicles and two thousand armed police in an attempt to suppress the workers' just struggle. However, the workers were fearless and continued to fight bravely against the armed police.

    东京山谷区两千工人示威怒烧警察所
    新华社十八日讯　据东方通讯社报道：被日本佐藤反动政府武装警察的无理镇压激怒了的东京山谷贫民区的约两千名工人，十七日晚上举行声势浩大的集会和示威，反对资本主义的野蛮统治和残酷剥削。
    山谷贫民区的工人们，十年来已经九次在暑期里举行这样英勇的斗争。
    十七日晚上，山谷贫民区的工人，高举写着“毛泽东思想万岁！”“粉碎日共修正主义！”等口号的红旗，聚集在山谷贫民区的一个警察所的门前，举行集会。工人代表在集会上强烈谴责武装警察镇压工人的罪恶行径。他们还揭露了日共修正主义集团破坏山谷工人的革命斗争，分裂工人运动，为美日反动派效劳的丑恶嘴脸。一位工人代表在会上强调指出，必须把反美爱国斗争坚决地进行到底。
    会后，工人们在这个警察所的周围游行示威，并高呼“解放山谷！”“粉碎警察所！”等口号。
    佐藤反动政府对工人的英勇斗争怕得要死，指使警察袭击示威群众。被激怒了的工人们把警察包围起来，并放火烧了这个警察所。
    在工人们的英勇反击下，佐藤反动政府又急急忙忙出动了装甲车和两千名武装警察，企图把工人的正义斗争镇压下去。但是，工人们毫不胆怯，同武装警察继续进行了英勇的搏斗。
