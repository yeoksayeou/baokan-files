Progressive students in some Latin American countries are currently engaged in a sustained and tenacious struggle against the evil rule of reactionary authorities and the decadent educational system.

In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, thousands of students held a demonstration in the city center on the 19th, protesting against insufficient educational funding and the government's planned university reorganization. They overturned many cars and erected barricades on major commercial streets, fighting bravely with sticks and stones against the armed police who came to suppress them. The students' demonstration paralyzed Rio de Janeiro's commercial district from noon to evening. On the evening of the 18th, several hundred students in Rio de Janeiro carried an empty coffin to symbolically "bury" the pro-American reactionary Minister of Education. The brave Brazilian students have repeatedly launched large-scale struggles this year to oppose U.S. imperialist cultural aggression and the reactionary educational policies of the pro-American dictatorship.

In Rosario, Argentina, groups of students took to the streets on the evening of the 18th to demonstrate against the reactionary policies of the Ongania dictatorship. They distributed leaflets, demanding national liberation and calling on the people to support the general strike and class boycott scheduled for the 28th, the second anniversary of Ongania's coup. In Tucuman, students held a flash rally in front of the National University building to protest police suppression of students and oppose the educational plans of the school authorities.

In Santiago, Chile, students of the Philosophy and Education Faculty of the University of Chile declared their firm opposition to the so-called "resumption order" plotted by revisionists and continued their strike on the 19th, demanding a reform of the decadent educational system. They announced that they would not compromise with the reactionary school authorities. Their struggle was supported by more than ten thousand university teachers and administrative staff of the University of Chile.

In Guayaquil, Ecuador, thousands of students, despite the suppression by reactionary police, continued their demonstration on the evening of the 18th, demanding a reduction in public bus fares.

In La Paz, the capital of Bolivia, four thousand students of San Andres University held a demonstration on the evening of the 18th to oppose the reactionary rule of the pro-American military dictatorship in Bolivia.

Santiago reports: The struggle of Chilean workers and employees against capitalist exploitation and for wage increases continues to surge.

More than forty thousand medical workers in Chile held a 24-hour strike on the 19th to protest the government's refusal to pay the recently mandated wage increase in full. They pointed out that due to the soaring food prices, delaying the payment of the increased wages is a reactionary measure against the interests of the workers.

At the same time, the National Federation of Government Employees also announced a general strike to protest the authorities' refusal to pay the adjusted wages.

Nearly eight thousand workers at the Lota Schwager coal mine, Chile's largest, went on strike on the 18th to protest the company's disregard for worker safety, which resulted in serious injuries. The company, in order to extract excess profits, refused to install ventilation equipment in the mine, causing a coal gas explosion in the afternoon of the 17th, which killed thirteen miners and injured seven.

The three thousand employees of the national airline of Chile, who began their strike in early June, are still holding firm. On the 15th, twenty striking workers briefly occupied an airplane to protest the authorities' hiring of Americans to work during the strike.

Due to the intensified infiltration and exploitation of the United States in Chile, the economic situation in Chile is getting worse. Since March this year, hundreds of thousands of workers, employees, and teachers from various industries in Chile have continuously launched large-scale strike waves.

    智利四万多名医务工作人员十九日举行二十四小时罢工，抗议政府拒绝一次付清最近规定增加的工资。他们指出，由于食品价格飞涨，拖延支付增加的工资是违反职工利益的反动措施。
