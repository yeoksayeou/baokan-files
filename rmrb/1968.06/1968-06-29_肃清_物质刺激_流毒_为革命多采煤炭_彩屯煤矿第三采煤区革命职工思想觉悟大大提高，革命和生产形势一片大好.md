The propaganda team of the People's Liberation Army stationed at the Cai Tun Coal Mine's Third Coal Mining Area in the Benxi Mining Bureau has enthusiastically assisted the revolutionary committee of the mining area in mobilizing the masses to concentrate their efforts on criticizing the "material incentives" and "bonus system" of the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods promoted by the clique of renegades, hidden traitors, and scabs within the Party, led by China's Khrushchev. This has greatly promoted the revolutionization of people's thinking, and both the revolutionary and production situations are excellent.

The Third Coal Mining Area of Cai Tun Coal Mine is a relatively large modernized mining area. In the past, the clique of renegades, hidden traitors, and scabs within the Party, led by China's Khrushchev, vigorously promoted the "material incentives" and "bonus system" of counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods here, attempting to restore capitalism. After the establishment of the revolutionary committee of the mining area, the PLA propaganda team and members of the revolutionary committee followed the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching that "Our current important task on the ideological front is to carry out a critique of revisionism." They mobilized the masses to launch a revolutionary critique of the "material incentives" and "bonus system" of counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods. Revolutionary workers exposed the crimes of "material incentives" and "bonus system" and combined the struggle against selfishness with the critique of revisionism to deeply examine their own influences. Many old workers said that China's Khrushchev and the clique of renegades, hidden traitors, and scabs within the Party promoted the "material incentives" and "bonus system" of revisionist black goods, attempting to stuff us workers into a "money jar." These elements vigorously propagated the reactionary idea of "money is everything," with more than twenty types of bonuses, including bonuses for cold weather during commutes. These elements used "material incentives" and "bonus system" to fire sugar-coated bullets at us, making us only think about our own small lives, forgetting national and international affairs, and forgetting the revolution.

To elevate the critique of "material incentives" and "bonus system" to the level of the struggle between the two lines and fundamentally raise the awareness of the two-line struggle among the broad revolutionary workers, the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team and members of the revolutionary committee, together with the broad revolutionary workers, held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They deeply studied Chairman Mao's great teachings on politics being the commander, the soul, and "political work is the lifeline of all economic work," and Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They guided everyone to discuss the topic "Why Produce More and Better Coal?" This helped everyone further realize that the working class is the master of the state, and working full shifts, attending work punctually, producing more and better coal is their duty. Chairman Mao teaches us to serve the people. We produce more and better coal not for money, but for the revolution, for the socialist construction of our motherland, and for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. Based on the improved understanding, the propaganda team and members of the revolutionary committee, together with the broad revolutionary workers, reviewed the facts of class struggle in factories and mines over the past decade. This made everyone see more clearly that criticizing the "material incentives" and "bonus system" of revisionist black goods is a struggle to thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev, defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. The broad revolutionary workers actively participated in the revolutionary critique. From the surface to the underground, from the mining area to the home, revolutionary critique battlefields were set up everywhere. They studied a segment of Chairman Mao's teachings, criticized a counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacy of China's Khrushchev and the clique of renegades, hidden traitors, and scabs within the Party, purged a stream of poison, and combined the revolutionary critique with the reform of their units. They reformed the enterprise management systems that served the revisionist line.

As the revolutionary critique deepened step by step, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line was more deeply ingrained in people's hearts. The broad revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres' awareness of actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought greatly increased. They established a system for studying Chairman Mao's works, and Mao Zedong Thought study classes were set up from the mining area to the home. Revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres insisted on using Mao Zedong Thought as the banner, walking the path of emphasizing proletarian politics. With deep class feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, they studied Chairman Mao's relevant teachings before work every day, used Mao Zedong Thought to direct the battle during production, and used Mao Zedong Thought to inspect work after work. This greatly promoted the revolutionization of people's thinking. The broad revolutionary workers insisted on working full shifts, attending work punctually, producing more and better coal. The entire mining area has consistently exceeded the state's original coal production plan month after month.

    肃清“物质刺激”流毒　为革命多采煤炭
    彩屯煤矿第三采煤区革命职工思想觉悟大大提高，革命和生产形势一片大好
    据新华社沈阳二十八日电　人民解放军某部驻本溪矿务局彩屯煤矿第三采煤区毛泽东思想宣传队，热情帮助采煤区革命委员会广泛发动群众，集中火力狠批中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派的“物质刺激”“奖金挂帅”等反革命修正主义黑货，大大促进了人的思想革命化，革命形势一片大好，生产蒸蒸日上。
    彩屯煤矿第三采煤区是一个较大的现代化采区。过去，中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派，在这里拚命推行“物质刺激”“奖金挂帅”等反革命修正主义黑货，妄图复辟资本主义。采煤区革命委员会成立之后，解放军宣传队和革委会的成员遵照伟大领袖毛主席“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判”的教导，广泛发动群众，对“物质刺激”
  “奖金挂帅”等反革命修正主义黑货展开了革命的大批判。革命职工大摆“物质刺激”“奖金挂帅”的罪行，并且把斗私和批修结合起来，深挖对自己的影响。许多老工人说，中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派推行“物质刺激”“奖金挂帅”等修正主义黑货，是妄想把我们工人闷在“钱罐”里。这些家伙拚命宣传“金钱就是一切”的反动思想，光“奖金”项目就有二十多种，连上下班天气冷还有什么“受冻奖”。这些家伙搞“物质刺激”
  “奖金挂帅”，就是向我们发射糖衣炮弹，要我们只想自己的小日子，忘记国家大事和世界大事，忘记革命。
    为了把“物质刺激”“奖金挂帅”提到两条路线斗争的高度来批判，从根本上提高广大革命职工的两条路线斗争觉悟，毛泽东思想宣传队和革委会成员同广大革命职工一起，举办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，深入学习毛主席关于政治是统帅，是灵魂，“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的伟大教导，和毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列最新指示，引导大家以“多出煤，出好煤为了什么”为题展开讨论，使大家进一步认识到，工人阶级是国家的主人翁，上满班、出满勤、多出煤、出好煤，是应尽的职责。毛主席教导我们为人民服务，我们多出煤、出好煤，决不是为了金钱，而是为了革命，是为了祖国的社会主义建设，为了巩固无产阶级专政。在提高认识的基础上，宣传队和革委会的成员又同广大革命职工一起，回顾了十几年来厂矿企业中阶级斗争的事实，使大家更加清楚地看到，批判“物质刺激”“奖金挂帅”等修正主义黑货，是一场彻底粉碎中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，巩固无产阶级专政的斗争。广大革命职工积极投入了革命的大批判，从井上到井下，从矿区到家庭，处处都摆开了革命大批判的战场。他们学习毛主席的一段教导，批判中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派的一个反革命修正主义谬论，肃清一股流毒，并且把革命大批判和本单位的斗批改结合起来，对那些为修正主义路线服务的企业管理制度进行了改革。
    随着革命大批判的步步深入，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线更加深入人心，广大革命职工和革命干部活学活用毛泽东思想的自觉性大大提高。他们建立了学习毛主席著作的制度，毛泽东思想学习班从矿区到家庭都办起来了。革命职工和革命干部坚持用毛泽东思想挂帅，走突出无产阶级政治的道路。他们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的深厚阶级感情，每天上班前学习毛主席的有关教导，生产中用毛泽东思想指挥战斗，下班后用毛泽东思想检查工作，大大促进了人的思想革命化。广大革命职工坚持上满班，出满勤，多出煤，出好煤。整个采煤区月月超额完成国家原煤生产计划。
