BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) - According to a report by the Oriental News Agency: On June 15, patriotic workers and students, along with the broad masses of the people, held massive rallies and demonstrations across Japan, demanding the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

Patriotic students and workers stood shoulder to shoulder, fully demonstrating the powerful force of the people's anti-U.S. struggle.

In Tokyo and several prefectures in the Kanto region, 20,000 workers, students, and citizens gathered in the afternoon and evening of June 15 at Hibiya Park in Tokyo for a rally and then marched to the U.S. Embassy, the Prime Minister's official residence, and the National Diet to hold demonstrations. During the march, people held up large red banners with the words "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought" and banners reading "Fight alongside the people of France." They also wore headbands with the words "Anti-imperialism, Anti-revisionism," and their fighting spirit was extremely high.

Many representatives spoke at the rally, unanimously expressing their determination to carry the struggle to smash the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" to the end. They also severely criticized the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist group led by Kyuichi Tokuda for its "parliamentary road." In their speeches, the representatives also exposed the crimes of U.S. imperialism in invading Vietnam and strongly condemned the Sato reactionary government for participating in the U.S. imperialist invasion of Vietnam.

June 15 marked the eighth anniversary of the day when the patriotic student Katsumi Karei was killed by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. After the rally, the patriotic masses marched to the National Diet Building, to the spot where Katsumi Karei had heroically sacrificed his life. The people shouted, "We will advance following the bloodstained path of Katsumi Karei!" "We will continue the struggle until the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty' is abolished!"

Subsequently, the demonstration procession marched in an orderly manner to the Prime Minister's official residence and the U.S. Embassy. In front of the U.S. Embassy, the patriotic masses, filled with hatred towards the evil U.S. imperialists, angrily shouted, "Yankees, get out of Okinawa and Japan!" "Yankees, get out of Vietnam!" "Resolutely oppose the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty'!"

Some of the masses also threw paper airplanes with anti-U.S. slogans into the courtyard of the U.S. Embassy.

The Yankees were terrified by the demonstrators, keeping their doors tightly shut and hiding inside the building.

The Sato reactionary government dispatched thousands of armed police to brutally suppress the patriotic masses. However, the brave workers and students fearlessly fought back. Anti-U.S. slogans echoed through the skies of Tokyo.

The procession continued to demonstrate in the bustling areas of Tokyo. A group of students burned the U.S. flag and the Sato government's recruitment advertisements on the street, expressing the hatred of the Japanese people towards U.S. imperialism and Japanese militarism. During the struggle, 20 people were illegally arrested by the police.

In Osaka City, about 15,000 workers, students, and citizens held a large-scale demonstration and march until late at night. The streets still resonated with the songs of "The Internationale" and the slogans to smash the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." When the procession passed through the bustling areas, the residents welcomed the demonstrators with enthusiastic applause, and many residents joined the demonstration.

Approximately 2,000 armed police repeatedly attacked the demonstration procession. The brave patriotic masses fought back with their fists and stones. The demonstrators repelled the police attacks.

In Fukuoka Prefecture, patriotic students and residents, despite the suppression by the Sato reactionary government, held an anti-U.S. rally in front of the gate of the U.S. Air Force base in Banbu. The attendees, facing the U.S. military base, repeatedly shouted, "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Yankees, get out of Japan!" "Immediately withdraw from the Banbu base!"

In Yamaguchi Prefecture, 1,000 young people and students braved the rain to hold rallies and demonstrations in seven cities across the prefecture, expressing their determination to fight to abolish the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and oppose Japanese militarism.

At the rally held in Shimonoseki City, representatives from the Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee of the Japanese Communist Party (Left) and the Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee of the Democratic Youth League (Left) called for carrying the great revolutionary struggle to abolish the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" to the end.

    爱国学生和工人并肩战斗　坚决粉碎日美“安全条约”
    日本各地广大群众举行反美大示威
    示威群众痛斥日共宫本修正主义集团叛卖行径，怒呼：打倒美帝国主义
    新华社十六日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本爱国工人和学生以及广大群众十五日在全国各地举行声势浩大的集会和示威游行，要求废除日美“安全条约”。
    爱国学生和工人并肩战斗，充分显示了群众反美斗争的强大力量。
    东京和来自关东地区几个县的工人、学生和市民两万人，十五日下午和晚上在东京日比谷公园举行集会，并到美国大使馆和日本首相官邸以及国会前举行示威游行。游行时，人们举着写有“毛泽东思想万岁”的大红旗，举着写有“与法国人民并肩战斗”的横幅，头上扎着有“反帝反修”的布带，斗志极为高昂。
    许多代表在集会上讲话，一致表示决心把粉碎日美“安全条约”的斗争进行到底，并且严厉批判了日共宫本修正主义集团的“议会道路”。代表们在讲话中还揭露了美帝侵略越南的罪行，强烈谴责了佐藤反动政府参与美帝侵略越南的行径。
    六月十五日是日本民族英雄、爱国学生桦美智子被美日反动派杀害八周年的日子。爱国群众集会后前往国会大厦，在当年桦美智子壮烈牺牲的地方游行。人们高呼：“我们将踏着桦美智子的血迹前进！”“我们将坚持斗争，直到废除日美‘安全条约’！”
    随后，示威队伍浩浩荡荡地前往首相官邸和美国大使馆。在美国大使馆门前，爱国群众怀着对万恶的美帝国主义者的无比仇恨，愤怒高呼：“美国佬从冲绳和日本滚回去！”“美国佬从越南滚出去！”“坚决反对日美‘安全条约’！”
    一些群众还把写着反美口号的纸制飞机投向美国大使馆院内。
    美国佬被示威群众吓得心惊胆战，大门紧闭，龟缩在楼里不敢露面。
    佐藤反动政府出动了数以千计的武装警察，对爱国群众进行野蛮的镇压。但是英勇的工人和学生毫不畏惧地予以回击。反美口号此起彼伏，响彻了东京的上空。
    游行队伍继续到东京闹市区示威。一群学生在大街上焚烧了美国星条旗和佐藤政府的募兵广告，表现了日本人民对美帝国主义和日本军国主义的仇恨。在斗争中，有二十人被警察无理逮捕。
    在大阪市，约一万五千名工人、学生和市民举行大规模示威游行直到深夜，大街上还回响着《国际歌》的歌声和粉碎日美“安全条约”的口号声。当游行队伍走过闹市区时，市民们以热烈的掌声欢迎示威群众，许多市民参加了示威行列。
    大约有两千名武装警察，一再袭击示威队伍。勇敢的爱国群众用拳头和石头同警察搏斗。示威群众击退了警察的袭击。
    福冈县的爱国学生和市民不顾佐藤反动政府的镇压，在美国空军板付基地的大门前举行了反美集会。到会群众面对美军基地不断高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！”“美国佬滚出日本！”“立即撤出板付基地！”
    山口县的一千名青年和学生冒着大雨在全县的七个城市举行集会和示威游行，表示决心为废除日美“安全条约”和反对日本军国主义而奋斗。
    在下关市举行的集会上，日共山口县委员会（左派）和民主青年同盟山口县委员会（左派）的代表号召把反对日美“安全条约”的伟大革命斗争进行到底。
