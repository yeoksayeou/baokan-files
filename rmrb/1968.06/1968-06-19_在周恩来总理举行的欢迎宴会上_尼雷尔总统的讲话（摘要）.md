Speech by President Nyerere of the United Republic of Tanzania at the Welcome Banquet Hosted by Premier Zhou Enlai (Excerpt)

	It has been only a little over three years since my last visit to your great country, but since then, both China and Tanzania have made many important developments. You are currently carrying out a cultural revolution in your country, and I hope to learn more about this during my stay here in the coming days.

	The sovereignty of the people is our most important wish, and yet it is also the most difficult to achieve. It is the most important because the interests of the people are the sole legitimate purpose of all state activities, and only the people themselves can determine what their interests are. The sovereignty of the people means that the people themselves control their own economic activities, decide what laws to follow, what customs to adhere to, and through what political institutions to govern themselves. These things can only be achieved when the people have freed themselves from all external control, from the threats and ravages of exploitation, oppression, hunger, and diseases that sap their strength.

	To eliminate hunger, to advance education, and to achieve the healthy physiques that we all desire, men and women must work together—sometimes on large-scale projects. If people engage in collective labor, using modern methods and more complex machinery, then agricultural productivity can be increased. Schools need trained teachers, and they need research and universities to support them. To have a healthy body, one must have knowledge, and there must be doctors and hospital services. All of this in itself requires a fairly complex organization, as well as some complex transportation systems, and so on.

	In reality, we are all looking for such experts, whether they are in the field of science, administrative management, or any of the many other areas we need, who seek only to use their knowledge and abilities to serve the people, to serve in the way the people themselves demand.

	I believe that we all, wherever we are, must constantly struggle to maintain the supreme position of the people. We must always be vigilant to ensure that the people are not exploited by those in power who have been entrusted by them, that they are not stifled by bureaucracy and inefficiency, and that they do not go astray because of their own ignorance.

	The history of the Chinese revolution since its inception has shown the determination of the leaders of the People's Republic in this regard. They have launched movements many times to oppose those leaders who are deemed to have abused their power or become detached from the masses.

	What impressed me most during my visit to China in 1965, and what also left a deep impression on the Tanzanians who are currently in China, was the enthusiastic and hardworking attitude of the Chinese workers.

	We have adopted different methods—one might also say that we have used different bricks and different construction plans in building our people's society. However, although we have adopted methods that we believe are suitable for the needs of our two peoples, I believe that China and Tanzania are striving for the same goals, namely, for the sovereignty of the people and for the people to be free from exploitation and discrimination.

	I hope that during our stay in the People's Republic of China, I and my colleagues will have the opportunity to learn from your experiences in dealing with this issue. Tanzania should learn from the efforts and experiences of all countries, and of course, we are particularly interested in those countries that are also fighting against the poverty left over from the past and those that, like us, are dedicated to improving the living standards of the masses.

	In all these areas, the People's Republic of China has made tremendous progress in recent years. This shows what a determined nation can achieve, no matter how great the difficulties they face. We in Tanzania pay tribute to the efforts of the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, and we wish them continued progress along the path of socialism and the supremacy of the people.

    在周恩来总理举行的欢迎宴会上
    尼雷尔总统的讲话（摘要）
    新华社十八日讯　坦桑尼亚联合共和国总统尼雷尔在周恩来总理举行的欢迎宴会上的讲话（摘要）
    自从我上次访问你们伟大的国家以来，只过了三年多一点时间，但是从那时以来，中国和坦桑尼亚都有了许多重要的发展。你们正在国内进行文化革命，我希望在这几天里了解更多关于这方面的情况。
    人民的主权是我们最最重要的愿望，而在许多方面这又是最难实现的。这是最重要的，因为人民的利益是一切国家活动的唯一合法的宗旨，也只有人民自己才能说什么是他们的利益。人民的主权意味着由人民自己掌握自己的经济活动，自己决定要什么样的法律，遵循什么样的风俗，通过什么样的政治机构来管理自己。这些事情只有在人民摆脱了一切外来的控制，摆脱了剥削、暴虐、饥饿的威胁和摧残体力的疾病所造成的疲怠状态，才能做到。
    为了免除饥饿，为了实现教育事业的进步和具有我们大家都希望的健康体格，男女必须在一起工作——有时要从事规模很大的事业。如果人们从事集体劳动，使用现代方法和比较复杂的机械，那末，农业生产力就能提高。学校需要受过训练的教师，需要有研究工作和大学的配合。要有健康的体魄，就必须有知识，还必须有医生和医院的服务。这一切本身就要求有一个相当复杂的组织，以及一些复杂的交通系统，等等。
    实际上我们都是想找到这样一种专家，不管他是在科学方面，或是在行政管理方面或任何其他许多我们所需要的工作方面具有专门技能，他只谋求用自己的知识和能力来为人民服务，按照人民自己所要求的那样去服务。
    我相信，我们大家不论在什么地方都要经常进行斗争，以维护人民的至高无上的地位。我们要经常保持警惕，保证人民不被那些受他们委托而掌权的个人所利用，不为官僚主义和低效率所窒息，也不致因为自己的愚昧无知而走入歧途。
    中国革命以来的历史表明了人民共和国的领导人在这方面的决心。曾多次发动运动来反对那些被认为是滥用了职权或脱离了群众的领导人。
    一九六五年我在中国时使我印象最深刻的、也是现在正在我国的中国工人们给坦桑尼亚人留下最深刻印象的，就是他们的热情的勤劳的工作。
    我们采用了不同的方法——也可以说，我们在建设我们人民社会中采用了不同的砖瓦和不同的基建计划。但是，虽然我们采用了我们两国人民认为是适合于他们各自需要的办法，我相信，中国和坦桑尼亚是在为同样的目标，即为人民的主权和人民不受剥削和歧视而努力。
    我希望，在我们在中华人民共和国逗留的几天中，我和我的同事能有机会学习你们在处理这个问题方面的一些经验。我们坦桑尼亚应该向一切国家的努力和经验学习，当然，我们特别感兴趣的是，那些正在向过去遗留下来的贫困作斗争的国家，那些和我们一样致力于提高群众生活水平的国家。
    在所有这些事情上，中华人民共和国近年来都取得了巨大的进展。这就表明了，一个有决心的民族所能做到的事情，不管他们面临的困难有多大。我们坦桑尼亚向在毛泽东主席领导下的中国人民所做的努力致敬，并且愿意表示，我们希望他们沿着社会主义和人民至高无上的道路不断取得进步。
