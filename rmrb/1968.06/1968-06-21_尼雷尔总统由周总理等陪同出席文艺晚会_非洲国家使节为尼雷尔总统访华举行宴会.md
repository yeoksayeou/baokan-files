African diplomatic representatives in China hosted a banquet tonight to welcome the visit of President Julius K. Nyerere of the United Republic of Tanzania.

President Nyerere and his wife, along with other accompanying personnel, were invited to attend the banquet.

Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premiers Chen Yi and Li Xiannian, Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Huang Yongsheng, and other leaders from relevant government departments, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Beijing Revolutionary Committee, and other relevant organizations, including Lin Haiyun, Qi Pengfei, Xie Huaiyi, Ding Guanyi, Pan Zhenwu, and Ding Xilin, as well as representatives from Beijing's revolutionary mass organizations, were also invited to attend the banquet.

Ambassador Imam of the United Arab Republic, representing the African diplomatic representatives in China, spoke at the banquet. He said, "At a time when the struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism is intensifying, President Nyerere and his wife are visiting China to further strengthen the great friendship between the Chinese people and the peoples of Africa. Although the People's Republic of China and our countries are separated by vast distances, our peoples share a deep friendship, and we are engaged in a common struggle against imperialism and colonialism. This friendly relationship sets a good example for peaceful coexistence between countries with different systems."

President Nyerere and Premier Zhou also made toasts at the banquet.

President Nyerere said, "I believe that at present, Africa faces two major tasks: the first is to liberate our African continent from colonialism, and this task is not yet complete; the second is to maintain the independence of the African countries that have already gained independence. However, merely achieving national independence is not enough; this is only the beginning of the independence of the peoples of Africa. Our achievement of national independence should be to establish governments and economic institutions that are truly in the hands of the African people. He said, "We are now fighting for the realization of the second task in Africa."

President Nyerere said, "I sincerely believe that no matter how great the ideological differences between our African countries, if we truly seek independence for the benefit of our peoples and not for the benefit of a few ruling elites, all African countries can learn a great deal from China."

President Nyerere proposed a toast to the health of Chairman Mao Zedong, to the friendship and understanding between the peoples of Asia and Africa, and to the health of Chairman Mao Zedong.

Premier Zhou said, "There is a deep friendship and fighting unity between our Asian and African peoples. In the struggle against our common enemies—imperialism, old and new colonialism, and their running dogs—to defend and maintain the national independence and state sovereignty of Asian and African countries, we have always been sympathetic and supportive of each other. We are pleased to see that the struggle of the Asian and African peoples against imperialism and for independence has made great strides."

Premier Zhou proposed a toast to the continuous victories of the anti-imperialist and anti-colonial revolutionary struggles of the Asian and African peoples, to the health of President Nyerere and his wife, and to the health of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong.

Diplomatic representatives from countries outside Africa were also invited to attend the banquet.

    尼雷尔总统由周总理等陪同出席文艺晚会
    非洲国家使节为尼雷尔总统访华举行宴会
    新华社二十日讯　北京市革命委员会今天晚上举行文艺晚会，热烈欢迎尼雷尔总统和夫人，以及坦桑尼亚其他贵宾。晚会演出了革命现代芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》。
    当尼雷尔总统和夫人等由国务院总理周恩来，国务院副总理、北京市革命委员会主任谢富治等陪同，走进晚会会场的时候，全场起立热烈鼓掌。
    陪同观看演出的，还有国务院副总理陈毅、李先念，中国人民解放军总参谋长黄永胜，以及政府有关部门、中国人民解放军、北京市革命委员会和有关方面的负责人林海云、姬鹏飞、谢怀德、吴德、丁国钰、潘振武、丁西林等。
    坦桑尼亚驻中国大使姆瓦卢科和大使馆人员，以及在北京的坦桑尼亚朋友也应邀出席了晚会。
    演出结束时，尼雷尔总统和夫人等贵宾由周恩来、谢富治等陪同，在热烈的掌声中走上舞台，同演员们亲切握手，祝贺他们演出成功。
    新华社二十日讯　非洲国家驻中国使节为欢迎坦桑尼亚联合共和国总统朱利叶斯·克·尼雷尔访问中国，今晚举行宴会。
    尼雷尔总统和夫人及其他随行人员应邀出席了宴会。
    国务院总理周恩来，副总理陈毅、李先念，中国人民解放军总参谋长黄永胜，以及政府有关部门、中国人民解放军、北京市革命委员会和有关方面的负责人林海云、姬鹏飞、谢怀德、丁国钰、潘振武、丁西林，北京市革命群众组织的代表，应邀出席了宴会。
    阿联驻中国大使伊马姆代表非洲国家驻中国使节在宴会上讲话。他说，正当反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争进行的时候，尼雷尔总统和夫人到中国来访问，以进一步巩固伟大的中国人民和非洲各国人民之间的关系。他说，中华人民共和国和我们的国家虽然远隔万里，但是我们的人民之间有着深厚的友谊，我们对帝国主义和殖民主义还进行着共同的斗争。这种友好关系为不同制度国家的和平共处提供了很好的榜样。
    尼雷尔总统和周恩来总理也在宴会上祝酒。
    尼雷尔总统说，我认为现在非洲面临着两个主要任务：第一个任务是把我们的非洲大陆从殖民主义下解放出来，而这个任务还没有完成；第二个任务是我们要维护已经取得独立的非洲国家的独立。但是单单取得民族独立是不够的，这只是非洲各国人民刚刚取得独立的开始，我们取得民族独立，不仅是把外国帝国主义者、资本家赶走，而让一些当地资本家、法西斯主义者所代替，我们取得民族独立，应该是建立一些真正掌握在非洲人民手中的政府和经济机构。他说，我们现在正为在非洲实现第二个任务而进行着斗争。
    尼雷尔总统说，我非常真诚地相信这样一点：不管我们非洲国家之间，在意识形态上有多么大的不同，如果是真正为着我们各国人民取得好处而要求独立，而不是为少数执政者取得好处的话，所有非洲国家都毫无例外地可以从中国学到很多东西。
    尼雷尔总统提议为毛泽东主席的健康，为亚洲、非洲两大洲人民的友谊和了解，干杯！
    周恩来总理说，我们亚非人民之间有着深厚的友谊和战斗团结。在反对我们共同敌人——帝国主义、新老殖民主义及其帮凶走狗的斗争中，为了争取和维护亚非各国的民族独立和国家主权，我们一贯是互相同情、互相支持的。我们高兴地看到亚非人民团结反帝和争取独立的斗争有了很大的发展。
    周恩来总理提议为亚非人民的反帝、反殖革命斗争不断取得新的胜利，为尼雷尔总统和夫人的健康，为中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的健康，干杯！
    非洲以外的一些国家驻中国的使节也应邀出席了宴会。
