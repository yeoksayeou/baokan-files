Armed Indonesian communists and revolutionary people, fighting under the banner of armed struggle in the rural areas of East Java, have in recent months overcome numerous difficulties and repeatedly struck at the enemy. The revolutionary people of Central Java have also recently launched fierce struggles against the enemy.

According to the reactionary newspaper _Kami_ in Jakarta, recently, in the Wrida area of East Java alone, the people's armed forces, with the cooperation of local farmers, executed 30 anti-communist and anti-people landlords, reactionary village heads, reactionary military personnel, and key members of the "civil defense" forces, and seized their weapons. The newspaper revealed that on April 28, a reactionary military patrol team in the southern part of Wrida was ambushed by guerrilla fighters who had been lying in wait, resulting in the deaths of three reactionary soldiers. Another who fled to a nearby reactionary military outpost was so frightened that he "lost consciousness." The newspaper also reported that in May, a group of reactionary officers from Surabaya who went to Wrida to engage in counter-revolutionary activities were also attacked by the people's armed forces, resulting in the deaths of two reactionary officers. According to the Antara News Agency, in mid-May, two leaders of the reactionary local armed forces "civil defense" in the southern part of Malang, Sumberloroto District, were injured by guerrilla fighters active in the area.

According to another report: Some patriotic officers in the reactionary military stationed in East Java continued to rebel in May, turning their guns on the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime. According to the Associated Press, in May, "in East Java, 400 soldiers deserted."

In the rural areas of Central Java, news of farmers' fierce struggles against the enemy has also been continuously reported recently. According to the reactionary newspaper _Angkatan Bersenjata_ in Jakarta, on May 14, farmers in the southern part of Semarang District organized a violent resistance against reactionary military police. On that day, a group of reactionary military police came to loot timber. The farmers immediately sounded the alarm, and "crowds of people armed with machetes, broadswords, and swords rushed to the scene," engaging in a fierce battle with the reactionary military police. The farmers immediately wounded a reactionary policeman and destroyed the truck that came to transport the timber. The farmers also sabotaged bridges and "prepared in several strategic locations and hidden places," driving the reactionary government's reinforcements into confusion.

According to Western news agencies, a large number of Indonesian communists and revolutionary people imprisoned in the military prison in Surakarta, Central Java, staged an armed uprising on May 29 with the cooperation of some patriotic officers in the Indonesian reactionary military. They seized weapons from the enemy's armory and fled into the forest.

    新华社十四日讯　雅加达消息：高举武装斗争大旗战斗在东爪哇农村的印度尼西亚共产党人和革命人民，最近一个多月来冲破重重困难，不断打击敌人。中爪哇革命人民最近对敌人也展开了激烈的斗争。
    据雅加达反动报纸《卡米报》透露，最近，仅在东爪哇勿里达地区，人民武装就在当地农民的配合下，处决了三十名反共反人民的恶霸地主、反动村长、反动军队和“民防队”的骨干，并缴获了他们的武器。这家反动报纸透露，四月二十八日，一支反动军队的巡逻队在勿里达南部巡逻，遭到早已埋伏好的游击队战士的突然袭击，三名反动军队的官兵被人民游击队击毙，另一个逃窜到附近反动军队哨所的家伙吓得“不省人事”。这家反动报纸还透露，五月间，一伙反动军官从泗水来到勿里达进行反革命活动时，也受到人民武装的袭击，有两名反动军官被击毙。据安塔拉通讯社透露，五月中旬，玛琅市南部顺伯尔罗托乡的反动地方武装“民防队”的两个头目被活跃在这一地区的人民游击队战士击伤。
    另据报道：驻扎在东爪哇地区的反动军队中的一些爱国官兵，在五月间继续举行起义，掉转枪口，反抗苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权。据美联社透露，五月间，“在东爪哇有四百名军人开了小差”。
    在中爪哇农村，最近也不断传出了农民群众对敌人进行激烈斗争的消息。据雅加达反动报纸《武装部队报》透露，中爪哇南望乡农民于五月十四日对反动军警进行了一次有组织的暴力反抗。这一天，一批反动军警前来抢劫木材。农民群众立即敲起了木梆，随后，“成群的人手持大刀、阔头刀、剑等纷纷赶来”，同反动军警展开了搏斗。农民群众当场击伤了一个反动警察，捣毁了前来抢运木材的卡车。农民群众还破坏了桥梁，“在几处战略地点和暗处作好了准备”，把反动当局派去的增援部队打得晕头转向。
    据西方通讯社透露，大批被监禁在中爪哇梭罗市军事监狱的印度尼西亚共产党人和革命人民，五月二十九日在印尼反动军队中的一些爱国官兵的配合下举行武装暴动。他们夺了敌人军械库的武器，开进森林。
