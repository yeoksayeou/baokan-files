The great news that our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao received the representatives attending the conference on revolution and production in coal mines on May 20th has spread throughout the country, greatly inspiring the revolutionary workers and their families in coal mines across the country, and promoting the rapid development of the revolutionary and production situation in the coal industry.

The situation in coal mines across the country is excellent and getting better. The revolution is booming, and production reports are coming in frequently. Units that had not yet achieved great unity have quickly realized it with the spirit of "seizing the day," and revolutionary committees and revolutionary leading groups based on the "three-in-one combination" are being established one after another. The wave of mass revolutionary criticism is surging higher and higher, and the broad revolutionary workers are launching more fierce attacks on a handful of class enemies. Under this revolutionary situation, production is thriving. In late May, the average daily output of large coal mines directly under the Ministry of Coal Industry increased by 24.29% compared to the first half of May, and the output of local state-owned coal mines also increased significantly. Among them, the major coal mines such as Kailuan, Fengfeng, Jingxing, Shuangya, Zibo, Zaozhuang, Pingxiang, Huaibei, Benxi, Fuxin, and Datong have all completed their May production plans ahead of schedule and in excess, and many mining areas have created the highest production records in recent years. The advancement of the mining face has also achieved new results.

Revolutionary workers in the coal industry are extremely excited and point out: More than forty years ago, when the great Communist Party of China was just founded, Chairman Mao came to our coal miners, entered the workers' dormitories, went down the mines, and initiated the Anshan coal mine strike, pointing out the direction of struggle for us. Today, in the midst of the triumphant songs of seizing complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao personally received our representatives. This is the greatest care, encouragement, trust, and spur for all coal miners across the country. Miners pledge in front of Chairman Mao's portrait and declare their determination to follow the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, grasp the revolution, and promote production to achieve double victories in revolution and production.

Recently, the revolutionary workers of the Beijing Mining Bureau have studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions over and over again: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and its leadership of the broad revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." They have raised high the banner of revolutionary criticism guided by Mao Zedong Thought and launched a fierce attack on the class enemies. In just ten days from May 21st to 30th, various mines held thousands of criticism meetings and struggle meetings. From the surface to the underground, from the canteen to the family dormitories, revolutionary criticism battlefields were set up everywhere, striking hard at a handful of stubborn class enemies, traitors, spies, and unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have infiltrated the ranks of the working class.

The Revolutionary Committee of the Kailuan Mining Bureau, based on Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions and the new trends in class struggle, further deployed the work of revolution and production. Members of the Revolutionary Committee went deep into various mines to organize the broad revolutionary workers to study Chairman Mao's instructions, mobilize the masses, and resolutely oppose right opportunism, right splitism, and right capitulationism, smash the rightist reversal wind, strictly distinguish between the two types of contradictions, unite all revolutionary forces that can be united, and accurately and forcefully strike at a handful of class enemies.

Coal mines such as Huainan, Datong, Benxi, Beipiao, Zaozhuang, Jingxing, and Xiahuayuan have focused on class struggle, closely watched the new trends of class enemies, and timely exposed the evil plots of class enemies attempting to sabotage production and the newly established revolutionary committees, effectively consolidating the great unity of the revolution and the three-in-one combination, and removing obstacles for promoting production. Some coal mines also held large-scale struggle meetings and criticism meetings in front of the graves of miners killed by Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries (mass graves), inviting old workers with deep bitterness to recall their hardships and sweetness, angrily accuse and expose the heinous crimes of attempting to restore capitalism by China's Khrushchev and other handful of top capitalist roaders within the party and their agents, greatly enhancing the proletarian awareness and awareness of the two-line struggle of the broad revolutionary workers.

Great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Revolution is to liberate productive forces, revolution is to promote the development of productive forces." Revolutionary workers in coal mines across the country deeply understand that coal is the grain of industry. The quality of coal production is directly related to our country's socialist construction and industrial and agricultural production, related to the lives of urban and rural people, and related to the victorious advancement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Therefore, they resolutely implement Chairman Mao's policy of "grasping the revolution and promoting production," pouring their boundless love for Chairman Mao and the boundless enthusiasm released in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into production, promoting the rapid development of coal production.

The revolutionary workers of the Liaoyuan Mining Bureau, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, held a struggle meeting against counter-revolutionaries in front of the "mass grave" where the deceased miners are buried on May 21st. The revolutionary workers, with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and deep hatred for China's Khrushchev, went down to the mine to produce the next day, creating a high-yield record, with coal production doubling compared to the previous day, and the advancement of the mining face also doubling.

Since entering May, almost every mine and well in the Shuangya Mining Bureau has completed the production plan in excess every day. The workers of the eighth well of the Sifangtai Mine, after hearing that Chairman Mao had received the representatives of the eighth well attending the meeting in Beijing, regarded producing one more shovel of coal as an additional expression of loyalty to Chairman Mao, and advancing one more meter of the tunnel as shooting an additional arrow at the class enemies. All the revolutionary workers in the well overcame numerous difficulties, making the coal production in May nearly double and the advancement of the mining face also double.

Coal mines such as Kailuan, Fengfeng, Zibo, Xinwen, Zaozhuang, Fangzi, Yaojie, Aganzhen, and Jingyuan also completed the state plan in excess every day in late May.

Now, revolutionary workers in coal mines across the country are grasping the revolution and promoting production with high fighting spirit, striving to achieve greater results in June and report good news to Chairman Mao.

    毛主席林彪副主席亲切接见鼓舞广大职工乘胜前进
    全国煤炭工业战线抓革命促生产形势大好越来越好
    革命“三结合”的领导班子纷纷成立，群众性的革命大批判热潮一浪高过一浪，广大革命职工向一小撮阶级敌人发起了更加猛烈的进攻。革命有力地推动了生产向前发展，五月下旬，煤炭工业部直属大型煤矿的平均日产量，比五月上中旬增加百分之二十四点二九，地方国营煤矿产量也显著增加
    新华社七日讯　我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席，五月二十日接见出席煤矿抓革命、促生产会议代表的特大喜讯传遍全国以后，极大地鼓舞了各地煤矿的广大革命职工和家属，推动着煤炭工业战线革命和生产形势的迅速发展。
    全国煤矿形势一派大好，越来越好，革命搞得轰轰烈烈，生产捷报频传。一些原来没有实现革命大联合的单位，都以“只争朝夕”的精神迅速实现了革命的大联合，“三结合”的革命委员会和革命领导小组联翩诞生，群众性的革命大批判热潮一浪高过一浪，广大革命职工正在向一小撮阶级敌人发起更加猛烈的进攻。在革命的大好形势下，生产蒸蒸日上。五月下旬，煤炭工业部直属大型煤矿的平均日产量，比五月上中旬增加了百分之二十四点二九，地方国营煤矿的产量也有显著增加。其中，开滦、峰峰、井陉、双鸭、淄博、枣庄、萍乡、淮北、本溪、阜新、大同等主要煤矿，都提前超额完成了五月份生产计划，许多矿区创造了这几年来生产的最高纪录，掘进进尺也出现了新成绩。
    煤炭工业战线革命工人无比兴奋地指出：四十多年前，当伟大的中国共产党刚刚成立的时候，毛主席就来到我们煤矿工人中间，进工棚，下矿井，发动了安源煤矿大罢工，为我们指出了斗争的方向。今天，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席亲自接见了我们的代表，这是对我们全国煤矿工人的最大关怀，最大鼓舞，最大信任，最大鞭策。矿工们在毛主席像前献忠心，表决心，表示一定要以门合同志为榜样，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，狠抓革命，猛促生产，夺取革命、生产双胜利。
    北京矿务局的革命职工，最近一遍又一遍地学习了毛主席的最新指示：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”他们高举毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，向阶级敌人展开了猛烈的进攻。只五月二十一日到三十日的十天内，各矿就召开了上千次批判会和斗争会。从井上到井下，从食堂到家属宿舍，到处摆开了革命大批判的战场，狠狠地打击了一小撮顽固不化的走资派，混进工人阶级队伍内部的叛徒、特务和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子。
    开滦矿务局革命委员会根据毛主席的一系列最新指示，和当前阶级斗争的新动向，进一步部署了革命和生产工作。革委会成员分头深入各矿，组织广大革命职工学习毛主席的指示，发动群众，坚决反对右倾机会主义，右倾分裂主义，右倾投降主义，粉碎右倾翻案妖风，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，团结一切可以团结的革命力量，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人。
    淮南、大同、本溪、北票、枣庄、井陉、下花园等煤矿，狠抓阶级斗争，密切注视阶级敌人的新动向，及时揭穿阶级敌人妄图破坏生产，破坏新生的革命委员会的罪恶阴谋，有力地巩固了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，也为促进生产扫除了障碍。有的煤矿还在被日本帝国主义和国民党反动派杀害的死难矿工墓（万人坑）前，举行了声势浩大的斗争会和批判会，请苦大仇深的老工人忆苦思甜，愤怒控诉和揭发中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派及其代理人妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行，大大提高了广大革命职工的无产阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟。
    伟大领袖毛主席指出：“革命就是解放生产力，革命就是促进生产力的发展”。全国煤矿广大革命职工深刻认识到，煤炭是工业的粮食。煤炭生产的好坏，直接关系到我们国家的社会主义建设和工农业生产，关系到城乡人民生活，关系到无产阶级文化大革命的胜利进行。因此，他们坚决贯彻执行毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，把无限热爱毛主席的一片忠心，把在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲用到了生产上去，促使煤炭生产迅速发展。
    辽源矿务局的革命职工紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，五月二十一日在埋葬着死难矿工的“万人坑”前召开斗争反革命分子大会以后，革命职工们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱，对中国赫鲁晓夫无比仇恨下井生产，第二天就创造了高产纪录，煤炭产量比前一天增加了一倍，掘进进尺也翻了一番。
    双鸭矿务局自进入五月份以来，几乎矿矿、井井天天超额完成生产计划。四方台矿八井工人听到毛主席接见了八井在北京开会的代表以后，把多出一锹煤看作是对毛主席多献一份忠心，多掘进一米巷道看作是对阶级敌人多射出一支利箭，全井革命职工战胜了重重困难，使五月份的煤炭产量增加了将近两倍，掘进进尺也成倍增长。
    开滦、峰峰、淄博、新汶、枣庄、坊子、窑街、阿干镇、靖远等煤矿，五月下旬也都天天超额完成了国家计划。
    现在，全国煤矿革命职工正在以高昂的战斗意志，狠抓革命，猛促生产，争取在六月份创造出更大的成绩，向毛主席报喜。
