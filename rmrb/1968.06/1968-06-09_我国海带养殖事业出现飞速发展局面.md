The kelp aquaculture industry in China has seen rapid development. The revolutionary masses and cadres along the coast have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production." This has led to a rapid development in kelp aquaculture. Last year, the coastal regions harvested a significantly higher amount of kelp than in previous years. This year, the kelp aquaculture area has expanded by nearly 30% compared to last year.

Kelp naturally grows in cold and subarctic seas. Therefore, before liberation, China produced very little kelp and mainly relied on imports from abroad. After liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and the establishment of people's communes in coastal regions, the revolutionary masses and cadres, following Chairman Mao's great teaching of "breaking superstitions and liberating thought," boldly conducted experiments and research on kelp aquaculture. They successfully cultivated kelp in some southern seas and then expanded this practice to coastal regions. This has led to a high-speed development of China's kelp aquaculture industry. Now, the history of China importing kelp from abroad for many years has become a thing of the past.

    我国海带养殖事业出现飞速发展局面
    我国沿海地区的广大革命群众和革命干部，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，使海带养殖事业有了飞速的发展。去年，沿海各地海带的收获量已经大大超过历年的最高水平；今年，各地海带的养殖面积比去年扩大了将近三成。
    海带本来生长在寒带和亚寒带海区。因此，在解放前我国极少出产海带，主要靠从外国输入。解放后，特别是一九五八年大跃进和沿海地区实现人民公社化以来，广大革命群众和革命干部遵照毛主席“破除迷信，解放思想”的伟大教导，大胆地对海带养殖进行试验和研究，并陆续在南方的部分海区试养成功，接着又由点到面地向沿海广大地区推广。这样，就使我国的海带养殖事业得到高速度的发展。现在，在我国延续了许多年从国外输入海带的历史，已经一去不复返了。
