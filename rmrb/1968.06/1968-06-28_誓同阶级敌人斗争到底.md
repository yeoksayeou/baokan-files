The reactionary Kuomintang has long been overthrown by us. However, traitors, spies, stubborn reactionaries, and unrepentant landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, who represent the interests of the reactionary Kuomintang, are the remnants of the reactionary Kuomintang. We must emphasize class struggle—

	Resolutely Fight Class Enemies to the End

	Deputy Commander of the Militia, Bai Jia Brigade, Gansu Province, Linxia City, Pugan Commune

	In my ten years as a grassroots cadre in the countryside, I have deeply felt the correctness of the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions. Chairman Mao pointed out: "In the socialist historical stage, there still exist classes, class contradictions, and class struggle, there exist the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism, and there is the danger of capitalist restoration." The struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in the countryside has indeed never stopped.

	The Chinese Khrushchev said: "The main class struggle within the country has basically ended," "there will be no more revolutionary struggles," "that class struggle has passed, those things are no longer needed." This is a lie fabricated by the Chinese Khrushchev to cover up his attack on the dictatorship of the proletariat and the socialist cause.

	Look: In 1962, when the international imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries were stirring up an anti-China tide, the class enemies within the country were also stirring. The biggest capitalist-roader in the Gansu Provincial Party also hurriedly followed his master, the Chinese Khrushchev, and went to a certain brigade in our commune to "work on the spot," vigorously promoting "three autonomies and one contract." For a time, evil winds blew and dark clouds gathered. A small handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party blew the black wind of "three autonomies and one contract," making the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists arrogant, while we poor and lower-middle peasants firmly opposed it. Two old peasant women said to me: "Now they want to divide the land to households, isn't this turning the new society into the old society, turning the red society into the black society?" We thought: Anything that goes against Chairman Mao's instructions must be opposed, no matter whose idea it is. In this way, we resisted this reverse current, and their plots did not succeed.

	On one hand, they advocate the theory of "extinguishing class struggle," and on the other hand, they fiercely attack the proletariat and carry out capitalist restoration activities. This is precisely the two-faced strategy of the Chinese Khrushchev.

	Chairman Mao recently issued a great instruction: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a great political revolution under the conditions of socialism, where the proletariat opposes the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. It is the continuation of the long struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the broad revolutionary masses led by it and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and it is the continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." This brilliant instruction itself is a devastating criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev's theory of "extinguishing class struggle." It tells us that our class struggle with the bourgeoisie has not ended, and our class struggle with the Kuomintang reactionaries has not ended. The Chinese Khrushchev and a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party represent the interests of the Kuomintang reactionaries. What the Kuomintang reactionaries could not do, they did. Therefore, our struggle with them is a struggle with the Kuomintang reactionaries, and it is the struggle of the various ethnic groups in the northwest with Chiang Kai-shek and the bandits.

	We must always remember Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle," continuously and severely criticize the theory of "extinguishing class struggle," and continuously and severely grasp class struggle until classes are eliminated. In the future, whoever advocates the theory of "extinguishing class struggle" to us, we will regard that person as either poisoned by the Chinese Khrushchev or as a class enemy themselves.

### 誓同阶级敌人斗争到底

    国民党反动派早被我们打倒了。但是叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，代表国民党反动派利益，是国民党反动派的残渣余孽。我们一定要大讲阶级斗争，——
    誓同阶级敌人斗争到底
    甘肃省革命委员会委员临夏市枹罕公社拜家大队民兵副营长  包凤莲
    我在担任农村基层干部的十年中，深深体会到伟大领袖毛主席指示的英明正确。毛主席指出：“在社会主义这个历史阶段中，还存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，存在着社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争，存在着资本主义复辟的危险性。”农村的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，的确一直没有停止过。
    中国赫鲁晓夫胡说什么：“国内主要的阶级斗争已经基本上结束了”，“以后革命斗争没有了”，“那个阶级斗争已经过去了，那些事情已经用不着了。”这是中国赫鲁晓夫为了掩护他向无产阶级专政进攻，向社会主义事业进攻而编造出来的谎言。
    请看：一九六二年，正当国际上帝、修、反掀起反华逆流的时候，国内的阶级敌人也蠢蠢欲动。甘肃省党内最大的走资派也急忙追随主子中国赫鲁晓夫，赤膊上阵，来到我们公社某个大队“蹲点”，大搞“三自一包”。一时间，妖风四起，乌云满天。党内一小撮走资派刮起“三自一包”的黑风，使地富反坏右分子得意忘形，我们贫下中农则坚决反对。两位贫农老大娘对我说：“现在要把土地分到户，这不是要把新社会变成旧社会，红社会变成黑社会了吗？”我们想：凡是违反毛主席指示的，不管是谁的主意都要反对。就这样，我们顶住了这股逆流，使他们的阴谋诡计未能得逞。
    一面鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭”论，一面大肆向无产阶级进攻，大搞资本主义复辟活动，这正是中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命两手。
    毛主席最近发出了伟大的指示：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”这一光辉指示本身就是对中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论的摧毁性的批判，它告诉我们，我们同资产阶级的阶级斗争没有结束，我们同国民党反动派之间的阶级斗争也没有结束。中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派，代表的就是国民党反动派的利益，国民党反动派办不到的事，他们办了。因此，我们同他们的斗争，就是同国民党反动派的斗争，就是我们西北各族人民同蒋贼、马匪的斗争。
    我们要永远牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，不断地狠批“阶级斗争熄灭”论，不断地狠抓阶级斗争，一直到阶级消灭。今后，谁要向我们鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭”论，我们就认定这个人或者是中了中国赫鲁晓夫的毒，或者本身就是阶级敌人。
