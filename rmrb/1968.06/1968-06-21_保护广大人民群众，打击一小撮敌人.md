Our great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship." Chairman Mao's great instruction is a powerful ideological weapon for us to consolidate and develop the newly born revolutionary committees, and it is also a guideline for us to do a good job in supporting the left. It not only greatly enriches and develops the Marxist-Leninist theory on proletarian dictatorship, but also points the way for us to clean up class ranks and carry out the struggle against enemies at present.

Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has always been to protect the masses, trust the masses, and rely on the masses. Last February, when the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Sichuan stirred up a counter-revolutionary restoration tide in Zigong, the comrades of our People's Armed Forces resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's great order to "support the leftist broad masses," and resolutely supported the proletarian revolutionary factions in Zigong. The bourgeois reactionary line wanted to brutally suppress the masses, and we stood on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and fought against them head-on, resolutely protecting the masses. For local revolutionary masses, we protected them; for revolutionary masses from outside, we also protected them. We always stood together with the broad proletarian revolutionary factions, using the great thought of Mao Zedong as our weapon, and quickly smashed the once rampant counter-revolutionary tide. Through this struggle, we felt that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the most thorough mass line. The stronger the mass perspective, the higher the awareness of the struggle between the two lines; the closer to the masses, the deeper the understanding of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Protecting the masses is to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The struggle between the two lines is sharply reflected in the attitude towards the masses. Whether or not to correctly handle the masses is a big issue related to whether or not to carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and it is also a big issue related to whether or not the newly born revolutionary committees can be consolidated and developed.

Chairman Mao teaches us that the fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of power. All classes in Chinese society are closely watching the thousands of newly born revolutionary powers—revolutionary committees—springing up on Chinese soil. Each class is trying to influence it with its own interests, habits, and thoughts. The proletariat wants to consolidate and develop the newly born revolutionary committees, while the bourgeoisie wants to overthrow the newly born revolutionary committees. The issue of power remains the focal point of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. The newly born revolutionary committees must use Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle as a weapon to guide the broad revolutionary masses to strengthen their awareness of the enemy, pay attention to the new moves and methods of the class enemy at all times, and accurately and resolutely strike down a handful of class enemies. Doing so fundamentally represents the interests of the people, fundamentally protects the people, and fundamentally consolidates the proletarian dictatorship. In other words, only by resolutely striking down a handful of class enemies can we better safeguard the interests of the broad masses of the people; and only by well protecting the absolute majority of the people can we more effectively isolate and strike down a handful of class enemies.

After the establishment of the revolutionary committees, an important tactic used by the class enemies, as Chairman Mao pointed out, is: "When the representatives of various exploiting classes are in an unfavorable situation, in order to protect their current existence and facilitate future development, they often adopt the strategy of using offense as defense." They spread rumors and slander, stir up trouble, engage in rightist splittist activities, and spread a rightist revisionist wind, attempting to split the revolutionary committees and the revolutionary ranks. They stir up trouble between the leading members of the revolutionary committees, between the members of the revolutionary committees and the local troops, and between the members of the revolutionary committees and the people, attempting to shake and overthrow the newly born revolutionary committees, restore their lost "paradise," and once again ride on the heads of the people to continue suppressing the revolutionary masses. The actual class struggle in Zigong is a clear example.

After the establishment of the Zigong Revolutionary Committee, the broad masses enthusiastically cheered "Long live the revolutionary committees," they love the revolutionary committees, firmly uphold their revolutionary authority, and help them develop and improve. However, a handful of class enemies maliciously labeled the masses' proletarian feelings towards the revolutionary committees as "sugar-coated bullets," viciously slandering those who support the revolutionary committees as "brown-nosers," using despicable methods of distorting right and wrong to stir up trouble between the revolutionary committees and the people, attempting to destroy the revolutionary committees. After we exposed this trick of the class enemies, they seized on some shortcomings of the revolutionary masses who had come out of the white terror of the bourgeois reactionary line, generalizing from one instance, exaggerating, and trying to make these revolutionary masses feel disheartened. They spread this rightist revisionist wind, attempting to negate the immortal achievements of the revolutionary masses in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past two years and negate the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past two years.

Facing these conspiracies, our revolutionary committee, armed with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, led the broad masses of the people to launch a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies. We mobilized the masses to expose, criticize, and struggle against them, dragging them out into the open and thoroughly defeating them. In this intense struggle, we firmly grasped the direction of the struggle and seriously implemented the party's policies. The more the enemy used bourgeois factionalism to push some deceived masses to the forefront, the more we protected the masses wholeheartedly. For the revolutionary masses who, out of revolutionary interests, gave sincere advice and enthusiastically helped the revolutionary committees to improve and develop, we gave them warm welcome and praise; for the masses who were temporarily deceived and incited by bad elements, we patiently persuaded and educated them, helping them to raise their awareness of class struggle and line struggle. By uniting all possible revolutionary forces, we completely isolated a handful of class enemies who maliciously attacked and sabotaged the revolutionary committees and attempted to reverse the verdict and restore the old order, and they were dealt a heavy blow. The broad masses of the people said: "In the past, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Sichuan practiced bourgeois dictatorship on the masses, striking down a large number and protecting a few; now, the revolutionary committees advocated by Chairman Mao, with the 'three-in-one combination,' resolutely suppress a handful of class enemies and protect the broad masses of the people. The revolutionary committees are indeed our backbone and shield." Now, the Zigong Revolutionary Committee, like all revolutionary committees established nationwide, is becoming more and more consolidated and developed, and the situation is excellent.

    保护广大人民群众，打击一小撮敌人
    自贡市革命委员会主任、自贡市人民武装部第一政委　李宗白
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”毛主席的这一伟大教导，是我们巩固和发展新生的革命委员会的强大思想武器，也是我们做好支左工作的行动指南。它不但大大丰富和发展了马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级专政的学说，也给我们当前清理阶级队伍，开展对敌斗争指明了方向。
    毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，始终是保护群众、相信群众、依靠群众的。去年二月，当中国赫鲁晓夫和他在四川的代理人，在自贡市掀起一股反革命复辟逆流的时候，我们人民武装部的同志们，坚决地执行了毛主席关于“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号令，坚决地支持了自贡市的无产阶级革命派。资产阶级反动路线要疯狂镇压群众，我们就站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上，和他们针锋相对地斗争，坚决保护群众。对本地的革命群众，我们保护，外地来的革命群众，我们也保护。我们始终和广大无产阶级革命派团结、战斗在一起，以伟大的毛泽东思想为武器，迅速地粉碎了猖狂一时的反革命逆流。通过这段斗争，我们体会到，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就是最彻底的群众路线。群众观点越强，两条路线斗争的觉悟就越高；对群众越亲，对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线理解就越深。保护群众，就是保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    两条路线的斗争，尖锐地体现在对待群众的态度上。能否正确对待群众，是关系到能否执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的大问题，也是当前新生的革命委员会能否巩固和发展的大问题。
    毛主席教导我们，革命的根本问题是政权问题。中国社会各个阶级都在密切地注视着在中国大地上蓬勃兴起的千万个新生的革命政权——革命委员会。每个阶级都在力求以自己的利益、习惯、思想去影响它。无产阶级要巩固和发展新生的革命委员会，资产阶级要颠覆新生的革命委员会。政权问题，仍然是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的焦点。新生的革命委员会，必须以毛主席关于阶级斗争的教导为武器，引导广大革命群众增强敌情观念，时刻注意阶级敌人的新动向、新手法，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人。这样做，就是从根本上代表了人民群众的利益，从根本上保护了人民群众，从根本上巩固了无产阶级专政。这就是说，只有狠狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，才能更好地维护广大人民群众的利益；也只有很好地保护绝大多数人民群众，才能更有效地孤立和打击一小撮阶级敌人。
    革命委员会成立后，阶级敌人活动的一个重要手法，正如毛主席指出的：“各种剥削阶级的代表人物，当着他们处在不利情况的时候，为了保护他们现在的生存，以利将来的发展，他们往往采取以攻为守的策略。”他们造谣中伤，挑拨离间，大搞右倾分裂活动，大刮右倾翻案妖风，妄图分裂革命委员会，分裂革命队伍。他们挑拨革命委员会领导成员之间的关系，挑拨革委会成员与当地驻军的关系，挑拨革委会成员与人民群众之间的关系，妄图动摇和颠覆新生的革命委员会，恢复他们失去的“天堂”，重新骑在人民头上，继续镇压革命群众。自贡市的阶级斗争的实际就是一个明证。
    自贡市革命委员会成立后，广大群众热烈欢呼“革命委员会好”，他们热爱革命委员会，坚决维护它的革命权威，帮助它发展和完善。可是，一小撮阶级敌人却别有用心地把群众对革委会的无产阶级感情，说成是“糖衣炮弹”，恶毒诬蔑拥护革命委员会的人是“拍马屁”，用颠倒是非的卑鄙手段，挑拨革委会与人民群众的关系，妄图搞垮革委会。阶级敌人的这一着被我们识破以后，他们又抓住从资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖中杀出来的革命群众的一些缺点，以偏概全，尽量夸大，企图把这些革命群众搞得灰溜溜的。他们刮起这股右倾翻案妖风，就是妄图否定革命群众两年来在无产阶级文化大革命中建立的不朽功勋，否定两年来无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成果。
    面对这些阴谋活动，我们革委会以毛主席一系列最新指示为武器，带领广大人民群众，对一小撮阶级敌人发动了猛烈的进攻。我们发动群众对他们进行大揭发、大批判、大斗争，把他们揪在光天化日之下，斗倒斗臭。在这场激烈的斗争中，我们紧紧掌握斗争大方向，认真执行党的政策。敌人越是利用资产阶级派性，把部分受蒙蔽的群众推上第一线，我们就越是尽心尽力保护群众。对于从革命利益出发，善意提出意见，热情帮助革委会完善和发展的革命群众，我们给予热情欢迎和表扬；对于一时受坏人蒙蔽和煽动的部分群众，我们则进行了耐心的说服教育，帮助他们提高阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟。由于团结了一切可以团结的革命力量，就使一小撮恶意攻击和破坏革委会、企图翻案复辟的阶级敌人，彻底孤立起来，受到了沉重的打击。广大人民群众说：“过去中国赫鲁晓夫和他在四川的代理人，对群众实行资产阶级专政，打击一大片，保护一小撮；现在毛主席提倡的‘三结合’的革委会，坚决镇压一小撮阶级敌人，保护广大人民群众，革委会真是为我们撑腰壮胆。”现在，自贡市革委会和全国所有已成立的革委会一样，正在日益巩固和发展，形势一片大好。
