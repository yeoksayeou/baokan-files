	His Heart Holds Only Chairman Mao

	The wife of Comrade Menhe, Zhang Fengying

	Comrade Menhe has been gone for over half a year. During these days, I have repeatedly recalled many moving incidents from his life, and I feel even more that he was a great man in life and a glorious martyr in death. He was truly a good cadre educated by Chairman Mao, a good descendant of the poor peasants!

	In the more than ten years we have been married, he has educated and helped me in many ways. The most profound and unforgettable impression he left me with is that he thought of Chairman Mao in everything he did; Chairman Mao was always in his heart.

	In October 1948, we had only been married for four months when he eagerly volunteered to join the People's Liberation Army. At that time, my mother did not agree, and I had some reservations. He patiently said to me, "Fengying, we both grew up in hardship. Our families all have a ledger of bitterness. Today, we have been liberated and are living a happy life. How can we forget our savior, Chairman Mao? How can we forget that there are still many poor brothers who have not been liberated?" In this way, he convinced me and my mother, and he happily joined the army.

	After he joined the army, he often wrote letters to us, reminding us not to forget our roots and to follow Chairman Mao's words, resolutely walking the path Chairman Mao pointed out.

	In 1961, after I came from our hometown to Qinghai, I lived with him, and I felt even more that he was closest to Chairman Mao. After the Cultural Revolution, every time he returned from his unit to the family, the first thing he did was to wipe the frame holding Chairman Mao's portrait until it was spotless. Every morning after getting up, he would lead the children in singing "The East Is Red" in front of Chairman Mao's portrait. He often organized the whole family to study Chairman Mao's quotations. The children were not yet able to call him "Father" or "Mother," but he taught them to recognize Chairman Mao's portrait and to shout "Long live Chairman Mao!" Once, he held five-year-old Xiaoqingcang and pointed to Chairman Mao's portrait, saying, "Child, Chairman Mao is closer to you than your father and mother. He is our family's most beloved relative. You must always remember him!" Once, he bought twelve portraits of Chairman Mao and immediately took out the photos of him and the children from the frames, replacing them with Chairman Mao's portraits. He held the portrait of Chairman Mao, looking at it from all angles, and the more he looked, the more he loved it. He excitedly said, "This is good! We can see Chairman Mao whenever we look up, and we will have endless energy for revolution!"

	When he returned from his unit to the family, whether it was early or late, he always insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works. He had little education and faced many difficulties, but he studied very diligently and seriously. Sometimes, when I woke up from a nap, I would still see him studying Chairman Mao's works under the kerosene lamp. He often said to me, "Sleeping a little less is no big deal, but not studying Chairman Mao's works is absolutely not an option!"

	He strictly required me and the children to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. When I first came to Qinghai, I could not even recognize my own name, and I faced many difficulties in studying. He taught me letter by letter and explained it to me over and over again, encouraging me to overcome difficulties and persist in studying. He said, "Chairman Mao's books are written specifically for us poor people, and they are all about revolutionary principles. As long as you have deep proletarian feelings, you can understand them." Once, he asked me to recite a quotation, and I did not recite it correctly. He angrily said, "I think you have forgotten your roots and cannot even remember Chairman Mao's words!" Saying this, he asked Xiaojin to recite, and when Xiaojin recited it correctly, he happily said, "Xiaojin listens to Chairman Mao's words; she is Chairman Mao's good child!" Now, whenever I think of these things, I feel inspired and urged on.

	Menhe has left us, but his noble qualities of boundless love and loyalty to Chairman Mao will forever educate us. I must turn my grief into strength, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and resolve to think of Chairman Mao in everything, follow Chairman Mao in everything, keep up with Chairman Mao in everything, and do everything for Chairman Mao. At the same time, I must educate the children to inherit his will and become good successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

### 他心里只有毛主席

    他心里只有毛主席
    门合同志的爱人　张凤英
    门合离开我们已经半年多了。在这些日子里，我一次又一次地回忆起他生前许多感人的事，越加感到他生的伟大，死的光荣，真是毛主席他老人家教育出来的好干部，贫下中农的好后代！
    我们结婚十多年来，他对我有过许多教育和帮助。他留给我最深刻、最难忘的印象是：他干啥都想着毛主席，他心里只有毛主席。
    一九四八年十月，我们结婚刚刚四个月，他就积极报名参加人民解放军。当时，母亲不同意，我也有点顾虑，他就耐心地对我说：“凤英，咱们都是在苦水里长大的，咱们的家都有一本苦情账。今天翻了身，过上了幸福生活，我们怎能忘了救命恩人毛主席，怎能忘了天下还有更多的穷哥们没得到解放！”就这样他说服了我，也说服了母亲，高高兴兴地参了军。
    他到了部队后，经常来信教育我们不要忘本，听毛主席的话，坚决走毛主席指引的路。
    一九六一年，我从老家来到青海以后，就一直和他生活在一起，更感到他对毛主席最亲。文化大革命以后，他每次从连队回到家里做的第一件事，就是把装有毛主席像的镜框擦得净亮。每天起床后，他就带领孩子们在毛主席像前高唱《东方红》。他经常组织全家学习毛主席语录。孩子们还不会叫爸爸、妈妈，他就教认毛主席像，教喊“毛主席万岁！”一次，他抱着五岁的小青仓指着毛主席像说：“孩子，毛主席比你爸爸、妈妈还要亲，他是我们家最亲最亲的亲人，你要永远记着他老人家！”有一次，他买回来十二张毛主席像，便马上从镜框中取下他和孩子们的照片，换上了毛主席的照片。他手捧毛主席像，左看右看，越看越爱看，他激动地说：“这可好啦，我们抬头能看见毛主席，干革命就有了使不完的劲！”
    他从连队回家来，不论是早是晚，都要坚持学习毛主席著作。他文化低，困难多，但学习非常刻苦认真。有时，我一觉睡醒，还看见他在煤油灯下学习毛主席著作。他常对我说：“觉少睡一点没有啥，可毛主席著作不学万万不行！”
    他十分严格地要求我和孩子们活学活用毛主席著作。我刚到青海，连自己的名字都认不下，学习起来困难实在多。他就一字一句地教我念，一遍一遍地给我讲，鼓舞我克服困难，坚持学习。他说：“毛主席的书是专门为我们穷人写的，讲的全是革命的道理，只要有深厚的无产阶级感情，就能学懂。”有一次，他让我背一条语录，我没背会，他生气地说：“我看你忘了本，连毛主席他老人家的话也记不住！”说着，他又让小琴来背，小琴背会了，他就高兴地说：“小琴听毛主席的话，是毛主席的好孩子！”现在，每当回想起这些事，就觉得是对自己的鼓舞和鞭策。
    门合离开我们了，但是，他无限热爱毛主席、无限忠于毛主席的高贵品质，永远教育着我们。我一定要化悲痛为力量，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，决心象他那样，一切想着毛主席，一切服从毛主席，一切紧跟毛主席，一切为着毛主席。同时，要教育孩子继承他的遗志，当好无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
