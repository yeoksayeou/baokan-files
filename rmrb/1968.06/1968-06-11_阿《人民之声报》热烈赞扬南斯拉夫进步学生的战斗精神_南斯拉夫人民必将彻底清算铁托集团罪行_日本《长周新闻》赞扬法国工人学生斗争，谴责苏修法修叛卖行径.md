The Albanian "People's Voice" newspaper published an editorial on June 9, warmly praising the courageous struggle of progressive students in Yugoslavia against the Tito revisionist clique.

The article pointed out that the widespread movement of Yugoslav progressive students once again reflects the hatred and resistance of Yugoslav youth and people towards the complete degeneration and decay of the capitalist social and economic system of the Tito revisionist clique.

The article said that in Yugoslavia, the profound political and social crisis that shakes the entire country, the class contradictions that have been exacerbated by the complete restoration of capitalism, the irreconcilable national conflicts that frequently break out in various forms, and the political corruption and moral degeneration of the Tito clique, all these are the roots of the rebellion by the students of Belgrade and the entire Yugoslavia. The events in Belgrade and other cities in Yugoslavia, as well as the rebellion of Yugoslav students, deeply show that despite the long-term terrorist rule of the Tito clique and the use of various brutal and cunning means, it absolutely cannot extinguish the fighting and revolutionary spirit of the Yugoslav youth, workers, and people.

The article said that the Albanian people have always valued and will continue to value the fighting spirit of the Yugoslav working class, youth, and peasants, and believe that they will surely accumulate enough strength to thoroughly settle accounts with the Tito traitor clique that oppresses and enslaves them.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: The Japanese "Long-term Weekly News" published an editorial on June 9, praising the heroic struggle of French workers and students, and calling on the Japanese working class and people from all walks of life to launch a sustained and fierce attack on imperialism and its running dogs.

The editorial pointed out that the great struggle of French workers and students like a storm, has dealt a heavy blow to the ruling clique of French monopolistic capitalists and the revisionist clique, exposing the rottenness and decay of the entire capitalist world.

The editorial said that now the ruling clique of French monopolistic capitalists, with the help of its loyal servants—the French revisionist clique and the yellow union leaders, is on the one hand, sending out the army to intimidate and suppress, and on the other hand, using political deception tactics such as "reorganizing the cabinet" and "general elections," desperately struggling. However, all these despicable tricks cannot extinguish the burning flames of anger. The editorial said that the ugly traitor faces of the Soviet revisionists and the French revisionists have been fully exposed in this struggle. They desperately try to use "elections" to replace revolutionary struggles to save the monopolistic capitalists. This is the same as the counter-revolutionary deeds of the Japanese revisionist clique led by Kosaka.

The editorial pointed out that from Asia, Africa, and Latin America to Europe and North America, the struggle against imperialism and its running dogs has clearly proved the wise judgment of Chairman Mao: "At present, the world revolution has entered a great new era."

    南斯拉夫人民必将彻底清算铁托集团罪行
    日本《长周新闻》赞扬法国工人学生斗争，谴责苏修法修叛卖行径
    据新华社地拉那电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》九日发表编辑部文章，热烈赞扬南斯拉夫进步学生反抗铁托修正主义集团的英勇斗争。
    文章指出，南斯拉夫进步学生的这一广泛的运动，再次反映了南斯拉夫青年和人民对铁托修正主义集团的全面蜕化堕落和腐朽的资本主义社会和经济制度的仇恨和反抗。
    文章说，在南斯拉夫，震撼全国的深刻的政治和社会危机，由于全面复辟资本主义而激化了的阶级矛盾，经常以各种形式爆发的不可调和的民族冲突，以及铁托集团政治上的腐化和道德上的堕落，这一切就是贝尔格莱德和整个南斯拉夫的学生们起来造反的根源。贝尔格莱德和南斯拉夫其它城市的事件以及南斯拉夫学生们起来造反，深刻地表明，尽管铁托集团多年来进行恐怖统治，施展了各种野蛮和狡猾的手段，但是它绝对不能消灭南斯拉夫青年、工人和人民的战斗和革命的精神。
    文章说，阿尔巴尼亚人民过去和现在都珍视南斯拉夫工人阶级、青年和农民的战斗精神，并且相信，他们必将积蓄起足够的力量来彻底清算压迫和奴役他们的铁托叛徒集团。
    据新华社十日讯　东京消息：日本《长周新闻》九日发表社论，赞扬法国工人、学生的英勇斗争，号召日本工人阶级和各界人民向帝国主义及其走狗展开持久的、猛烈的进攻。
    社论指出，法国工人和学生暴风雨般的伟大斗争，给予法国垄断资产阶级统治集团和修正主义集团以重大打击，暴露了整个资本主义世界的腐朽和没落。
    社论说，现在法国垄断资产阶级统治集团正在它的忠实奴仆——法修集团和黄色工会头目的帮助下，一方面出动军队进行恫吓、镇压，一方面又使出所谓“改组内阁”“大选”等政治欺骗手段，拚命挣扎，但是这一切卑鄙的伎俩，都扑灭不了燃烧起来的愤怒火焰。社论说，苏修和法修集团丑恶的叛徒嘴脸在这次斗争中暴露无遗。它们拚命地企图用“选举”代替革命斗争，以挽救垄断资产阶级。这和宫本修正主义集团所干的反革命勾当是相同的。
    社论指出，从亚非拉到欧洲、北美，反对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争，清楚地证明了毛主席的英明论断：“当前，世界革命进入了一个伟大的新时代。”
