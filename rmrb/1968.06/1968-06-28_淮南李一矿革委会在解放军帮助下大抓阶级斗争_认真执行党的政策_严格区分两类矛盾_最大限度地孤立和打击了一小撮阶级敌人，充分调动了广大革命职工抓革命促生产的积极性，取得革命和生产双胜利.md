The Revolutionary Committee of Li Yi Mine in Huainan, with the help of the PLA's support-left personnel, has intensified class struggle, seriously implemented party policies, and strictly distinguished between the two types of contradictions. This has maximally isolated and struck down a handful of class enemies, fully mobilized the enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary workers to seize revolution and promote production, achieving double victories in revolution and production.

The Revolutionary Committee of Li Yi Mine, with the help of the PLA's support-left personnel, has, in the struggle against the enemy, seriously implemented party policies and strictly distinguished between two types of contradictions. They have launched a large-scale exposure, criticism, and struggle against a handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and other counter-revolutionaries. For those who have been deceived and made some mistakes, they have been strictly required in terms of ideology while also being united with them to jointly fight against the enemy. In this way, the Revolutionary Committee has united all forces that can be united, maximally isolated and struck down a handful of class enemies, and achieved double victories in revolution and production.

After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of Li Yi, some members devoted most of their energy to leading production and relaxed their grip on class struggle. The PLA's support-left personnel believed that whether to intensify class struggle or simply focus on production after the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee is a big issue. Therefore, it is necessary to help the newly established Revolutionary Committee become a strong fighting command center that emphasizes proletarian politics and leads the broad revolutionary workers to attack the class enemy. With the help of the support-left personnel, the Revolutionary Committee of Li Yi held a study class on Mao Zedong Thought, inviting some grassroots cadres to participate. They combined the live examples of the mine's equipment being sabotaged twice by class enemies to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings on "never forgetting class struggle." At the same time, they launched a discussion on "how to view the relationship between revolution and production." Through the discussion, the members of the study class enhanced their awareness of class struggle and deeply realized that class enemies will not readily accept their failures and will always use various opportunities to make desperate struggles. Sabotaging production is one of the vicious methods used by class enemies. Therefore, if class struggle is not intensified and production is simply focused on, it will give class enemies an opportunity to take advantage of.

Next, the Revolutionary Committee held a study class on class struggle at the grassroots level, repeatedly propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the masses: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and its leadership of the broad revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." The members of the Revolutionary Committee and the support-left personnel, together with the broad revolutionary workers, studied the new characteristics and problems of class struggle in the mining area and launched a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies. The broad revolutionary workers used the surging momentum from the class struggle and applied it to production, creating a high-yield record in coal production since the mine's establishment.

After the Revolutionary Committee of Li Yi Mine took the initiative in class struggle, the revolutionary and production situation became better and better. At this time, the support-left personnel discovered during their participation in production labor that a young worker had low labor enthusiasm and insufficient effort. After investigation, it was found that this young worker had been deceived by a bad element during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, made some mistakes, and was worried about being implicated, carrying a psychological burden. The support-left personnel and the members of the Revolutionary Committee jointly analyzed this situation and believed that it was a big issue related to how to correctly implement party policies and strictly distinguish between the two types of contradictions. To further understand the situation of the entire mine, they conducted investigations and research in various mine shafts and found similar problems in other mine shafts. Some leaders of mass organizations who had made mistakes and workers who had been deceived also carried psychological burdens to varying degrees. The broad revolutionary workers had different opinions about this part of the people; some believed it was an internal contradiction among the people and should be treated differently, while others believed these people should not be easily let go. A handful of class enemies also attempted to confuse the class line, shift the direction of the struggle, and slip away themselves. The members of the Revolutionary Committee and the support-left personnel conducted a serious analysis and believed that in the fierce attack on class enemies, whether to strictly distinguish between the two types of contradictions and correctly treat the deceived masses was a big issue of whether to follow Chairman Mao's teachings and unite the majority of cadres and masses to jointly fight against the enemy. Therefore, they immediately organized the revolutionary workers and cadres of the entire mine to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution." Everyone realized that to achieve a thorough victory in the struggle against the enemy, the proletariat must correctly distinguish and handle the two types of contradictions, unite all revolutionary forces that can be united, and maximally isolate and strike down a handful of class enemies.

There was a worker in the mine who, incited by an unrepentant landlord, engaged in anarchism. The workers were very angry with him, and he himself was also uneasy. However, under the leadership of the Revolutionary Committee, the workers distinguished this worker from the bad element who incited anarchism, conducted strict ideological education on him while also paying attention to uniting him, greatly enhancing his proletarian awareness. This worker checked his mistakes with everyone and faced the hidden landlord who instructed him to engage in anarchism for a face-to-face exposure and struggle. His actions gained everyone's trust, and he himself also felt relieved. Not only did he insist on the eight-hour workday, but he also actively went down the mine to participate in the coal production battle. Some of the masses who had been deceived also actively exposed and criticized bad people and bad deeds and actively participated in production.

The revolutionary and production situation in Li Yi Mine is excellent. Workers and their families are all striving to produce more coal. Coal production in April increased month by month, and in May, the state plan was completed six days ahead of schedule. In the first half of June, the revolutionary and production situation was even more gratifying, with many teams completing the entire month's production plan.

    淮南李一矿革委会在解放军帮助下大抓阶级斗争
    认真执行党的政策　严格区分两类矛盾
    最大限度地孤立和打击了一小撮阶级敌人，充分调动了广大革命职工抓革命促生产的积极性，取得革命和生产双胜利
    本报讯　淮南煤矿李一矿革命委员会，在解放军支左人员的帮助下，在对敌斗争中，认真执行党的政策，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，对一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派和其他反革命分子，展开了大揭发、大批判、大斗争；对受蒙蔽而干了一些错事的人，既从思想上严格要求，又注意团结他们共同对敌。这样，革委会就团结了一切可以团结的力量，最大限度地孤立和打击了一小撮阶级敌人，取得了革命和生产的双胜利。
    李一矿革委会成立以后，部分委员把大部精力放到了领导生产上，放松了抓阶级斗争。解放军支左人员认为：革委会成立以后，是狠抓阶级斗争还是单纯抓生产，是一个大问题。因此，必须帮助新生的革委会建设成为突出无产阶级政治、带领广大革命职工向阶级敌人进攻的坚强的战斗指挥部。在支左人员帮助下，李一矿革委会举办了毛泽东思想学习班，吸收了一部分基层干部参加。他们结合井口装置两次遭到阶级敌人破坏的活生生事例，反复学习毛主席关于“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，同时开展了一场“怎样看待革命和生产之间的关系”的讨论。通过讨论，学习班成员增强了阶级斗争观念，深刻地认识到，阶级敌人绝不甘心于自己的失败，总是在利用各种机会进行垂死的挣扎。破坏生产，就是阶级敌人一种恶毒的手法。因此，不抓阶级斗争，就生产抓生产，就会给阶级敌人以可乘之机。
    接着，革委会又把以阶级斗争为专题的学习班办到基层，向群众反复宣传毛主席的最新指示：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”革委会成员和支左人员同广大革命职工一起研究矿区阶级斗争的新特点、新问题，发动广大革命职工向一小撮阶级敌人猛烈进攻。广大革命职工又把从阶级斗争中焕发出来的冲天干劲用在生产上，创造了建矿以来煤炭生产的高产纪录。
    李一矿革委会掌握了阶级斗争主动权后，革命和生产形势越来越好。就在这时，支左人员在参加生产劳动的过程中，发现有个青年工人劳动情绪不高，劲头不足。经过了解，原来这个青年工人在无产阶级文化大革命中，受了一个坏家伙的蒙蔽，干了一些错事，担心自己会受牵连，思想上背了包袱。支左人员和革委会成员一起研究分析了这种情况，认为这是关系到如何正确执行党的政策、严格区分两类不同性质矛盾的大问题。为了进一步摸清全矿情况，他们深入到各个矿井进行调查研究，发现其他矿井也有类似问题。有些犯过错误的群众组织的头头和受蒙蔽的工人，也或多或少地背上了思想包袱。广大革命工人对这一部分人的看法也不一致，有的人认为这是人民内部矛盾，应当区别对待；有的人却认为不应轻易放过这些人。一小撮阶级敌人也妄图混淆阶级阵线，转移斗争大方向，自己乘机溜走。革委会成员和支左人员认真地进行了分析，认为在向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻的战斗中，能否严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，能否正确对待受蒙蔽的群众，是能不能遵照毛主席的教导，团结大多数干部和群众共同对敌的大问题。于是，他们立即组织全矿革命职工和革命干部，学习毛主席关于“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题”的教导。大家认识到：无产阶级要取得对敌斗争的彻底胜利，只有正确区分和处理两类不同性质的矛盾，团结一切可以团结的革命力量，才能最大限度地孤立和打击一小撮阶级敌人。
    矿上有个工人，受了一个没有改造好的地主分子的煽动，跟着闹无政府主义。工人们对他很气愤。他心里也不安。但是，工人们在革委会的领导下，把这个工人与煽动闹无政府主义的坏家伙严格区别开来，对这个工人既进行严格的思想教育，又注意团结，大大地提高了他的无产阶级觉悟。这个工人向大家检查了错误，并对指使他闹无政府主义的暗藏的地主分子进行面对面的揭发和斗争。他的行动得到大家信任，他自己也心情舒畅了，不仅能坚持八小时工作制，还主动下井参加夺煤大战。过去一度受蒙蔽的一部分群众也主动揭发和批判坏人坏事，并积极投入生产。
    李一矿革命和生产形势一派大好，职工和家属都在为多产煤炭而奋战。四月份煤炭生产旬旬上升，五月份又提前六天完成国家计划。六月上中旬革命和生产情况更加喜人，许多班组已完成了全月生产计划。
