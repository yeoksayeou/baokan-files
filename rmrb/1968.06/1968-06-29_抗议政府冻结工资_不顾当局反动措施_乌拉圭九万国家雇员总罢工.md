Uruguay's 90,000 state employees began a 72-hour general strike on June 26th, defying the authorities' ban, to protest the government's freeze on wages. This strike affected work in eleven departments. Faced with the relentless pressure from the surging workers' and students' movements, the beleaguered Uruguayan authorities announced so-called emergency security measures on June 13th, banning assemblies and demonstrations, and forcing striking workers to return to work. However, these repressive measures failed to stop the masses from resisting. Five thousand employees of two state-owned banks refused to comply with the order to return to work and insisted on striking to demand wage increases. The Uruguayan authorities, at a loss, arbitrarily declared martial law over the two banks on the 25th. On the same day, students in Montevideo once again held a series of demonstrations in the city center to protest the government's repressive measures. They also angrily threw stones at police vehicles.

The Uruguayan Minister of the Interior admitted on the 26th that due to the surging mass movements, Uruguay was experiencing the most severe turmoil in seventeen years. At the same time, the commander of the Uruguayan armed forces threatened, "If necessary, a nationwide military mobilization will be implemented." This means that military control will be enforced nationwide to strengthen the suppression of the masses.

    抗议政府冻结工资　不顾当局反动措施
    乌拉圭九万国家雇员总罢工
    据新华社二十七日讯　乌拉圭九万名国家雇员，二十六日不顾当局禁令，开始举行七十二小时总罢工，抗议政府冻结工资。这次罢工影响到十一个部门的工作。在日益高涨的工人和学生运动的不断冲击下，狼狈不堪的乌拉圭当局，曾经在六月十三日宣布所谓紧急安全措施，禁止集会示威，并强迫罢工工人复工。但是这种反动措施阻止不了广大群众的反抗。两家国营银行的五千名职工拒绝复工命令，坚持罢工要求增加工资。乌拉圭当局无计可施，竟在二十五日蛮横宣布对这两家银行实行军事管制。同一天，蒙得维的亚学生再次在市中心区举行一系列示威，抗议政府的反动措施。他们还愤怒地向警察局的车辆扔石块。
    乌拉圭内政部长二十六日承认，由于群众运动的高涨，乌拉圭正经历着十七年来最严重的动荡。同时，乌拉圭武装部队司令威胁说：“如果必要，将实行全民军事动员。”这就是说，要在全国实行军事控制，以便对群众加强镇压。
