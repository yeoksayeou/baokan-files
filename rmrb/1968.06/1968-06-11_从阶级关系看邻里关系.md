In the southwestern corner of Shanghai, there is an ordinary alleyway called Niupu Alley. Most of the residents here are working people.

On July 1, 1967, the first alleyway cadre study class was established here. Subsequently, all 1,190 households in the alley, consisting of working people, set up family study classes. Men, women, old, and young all studied Chairman Mao's works together, earnestly engaging in self-criticism and criticizing revisionism. The widespread promotion of Mao Zedong Thought brought about a significant change in the entire alley.

From the perspective of class relations, let us examine neighborhood relations.

In the past, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai, in order to restore capitalism, vigorously advocated the theory of the "extinction of class struggle." In the alley, some residents only talked about neighborhood relations and ignored class relations. "Auntie upstairs," "good neighbor," "uncle in the front building," "grandpa in the back building"—they made no distinction between classes or between enemies and friends.

In response to this situation, the Niupu Alley study class studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Never forget class struggle" and "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of the revolution." They fiercely criticized the theory of the "extinction of class struggle," raised the residents' awareness of class struggle, and formed a mass dictatorship team with veteran workers as the core. They exercised dictatorship over all the bad elements in the alley, supervising them in their labor. Retired worker Zhang Jinmei's uncle is a bad element who lives next door. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, this bad element rallied a group of unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in the alley to engage in counter-revolutionary activities. Zhang Jinmei initially could not bring herself to confront him, but after studying, she realized that showing mercy to bad elements meant an unstable stance and a failure to distinguish between enemies and friends, which was disloyal to Chairman Mao. Therefore, she assisted the police station in bringing this criminal to the meeting, where she confronted him face-to-face.

Through study, everyone also learned to use class analysis to observe and analyze problems. One residential group had constant disputes among neighbors. Using class analysis, they carefully investigated and finally exposed a landlord who specialized in sowing discord and disrupting the unity of the working people. This opened everyone's eyes.

Be ruthless to the enemy, be lenient to oneself. In the common struggle against the enemy, various barriers and knots among the working people were eliminated, and they truly became brothers and sisters of the same class. There was a sister Zhang who had a falling-out with a neighbor over a trivial matter. After studying Chairman Mao's teaching that "within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest," she engaged in intense self-criticism. She thought: Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest, so how could there be any fundamental conflicts of interest among us, the families of workers? Thus, she took the initiative to visit the neighbor, and they both engaged in self-criticism, exposing their private thoughts and criticizing each other. Finally, they resolved their ideological knots and established a close relationship.

### 从阶级关系看邻里关系

专栏：在毛泽东思想学习班里

    上海西南角，有一条普通的里弄，叫牛桥里弄。这里的大部分居民是劳动人民。
    一九六七年七月一日，这里办起了第一个里弄骨干学习班，接着全里弄一千一百九十户劳动人民，陆续办起了家庭学习班，男女老少共同学习毛主席著作，认真斗私批修。毛泽东思想的大普及使整个里弄起了大变化。
    从阶级关系看邻里关系
    过去，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在上海的代理人，为了复辟资本主义，拚命地鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭”论。在里弄里，有些居民只讲邻里关系，不讲阶级关系。“楼上阿姨”“隔壁好婆”“前楼叔叔”“后楼伯伯”，不分阶级，不分敌我。
    针对这种情况，牛桥里弄学习班里学了毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”，“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题”的教导，狠批“阶级斗争熄灭”论，提高了革命居民的阶级斗争观念，形成了一支以老工人为骨干的群众专政队伍，对全里弄的坏人实行专政，监督他们劳动。退休工人张金妹，她的亲大伯是个坏分子，住在她隔壁。在无产阶级文化大革命中，这个坏分子纠集里弄中一批没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，进行反革命活动。张金妹开始拉不开情面，经过学习，认识到同坏分子讲情面，就是立场不稳，敌我不分，就是对毛主席不忠。于是她协助派出所把这个坏蛋揪到会场，同他面对面地进行了斗争。
    通过学习，大家还学会了运用阶级分析的方法来观察和分析问题。有个居民小组，过去邻居之间纠纷不断。大家运用阶级分析方法，仔细一查，终于把一个专门挑拨离间、破坏劳动人民团结的地主分子揪了出来，这就擦亮了大家的眼睛。
    对敌狠，对己和。在共同的对敌斗争中，劳动人民之间各种隔阂、疙瘩消除了，真正变成阶级的兄弟姐妹关系。有一位姓张的大姐，为一件小事，与一个邻居很不和睦。学习毛主席“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突”的教导后，她展开了激烈的思想斗争。她想：工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突，我们工人家属之间，又有什么根本的利害冲突呢？于是她主动上门找那位邻居谈心，双方都作了自我批评，亮私斗私，终于解开了思想疙瘩，建立了亲密的关系。
