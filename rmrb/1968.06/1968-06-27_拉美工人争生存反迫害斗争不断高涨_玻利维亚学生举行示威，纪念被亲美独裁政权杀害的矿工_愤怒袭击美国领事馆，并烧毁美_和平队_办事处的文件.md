Latin American workers are continuously fighting for political rights and better living conditions through strikes.

In Trinidad and Tobago, drivers and managers of the state-owned bus company went on strike on the evening of the 21st, demanding the repeal of a reactionary law that prohibits workers from striking, and expressing solidarity with the strike of workers at the U.S.-owned "Lever Brothers Company." The workers at this U.S.-owned company had gone on strike six days earlier to demand recognition of their union. Due to the bus company workers' strike, public transportation on the island of Trinidad was paralyzed.

In Ecuador, truck drivers on the main highway connecting the capital Quito and the largest city Guayaquil, in the city of Quevedo, went on strike in early June, demanding better economic conditions and the abolition of unreasonable taxes. The truck drivers' strike completely halted traffic on this important highway. The Ecuadorian government admitted that due to the strike, hundreds of trucks carrying bananas were unable to move, putting 700,000 boxes of bananas at risk of rotting. The truck drivers' strike spread to other important cities along the main highway and its branches. The strike received support from the unions of five provinces, including Guayas, Tungurahua, and Chimborazo. On the 13th, the people of Quevedo also held a general strike and a general shutdown to support the truck drivers.

In the capital of Jamaica, Kingston, harbor pilots went on strike on the 21st, demanding a wage increase.

In Chile, approximately 6,000 paper mill workers have been on strike for over a month, demanding improved living conditions.

Xinhua News Agency, June 26th: La Paz news: On the evening of the 24th, students in Cochabamba, the second-largest city in Bolivia, held a demonstration and march to commemorate the miners who were massacred last June in the important tin mining areas of Catavi, Siglo Veinte, and Llallagua while resisting the bloody suppression of the pro-American dictatorship.

In their speeches, the demonstrating students strongly condemned the pro-American dictatorship and American imperialism. Despite the suppression by reactionary police, they angrily threw stones at the U.S. Consulate, the office of the U.S. "Peace Corps," and the provincial government, and burned the files of the "Peace Corps" office.

Meanwhile, revolutionary students at the San Andrés University in La Paz also held a demonstration and march. The participating students gave fiery speeches against the pro-American dictatorship and burned effigies of the military dictator.

Last June 24th, the pro-American dictatorship of Barrientos, frightened by the anti-American and anti-dictatorship struggle of Bolivian miners, brazenly sent troops to forcibly occupy the country's largest mining areas of Catavi, Siglo Veinte, and Llallagua, and carried out a bloody massacre of the brave miners who were fighting, resulting in a bloody incident. However, over the past year, the Bolivian miners, with their glorious tradition of struggle, have continued to fight fearlessly against the oppression.

    新华社二十六日讯  拉丁美洲的工人阶级为争取政治权利和改善生活待遇不断开展罢工斗争。
    在特里尼达和多巴哥，国营公共汽车公司的司机和管理人员二十一日晚举行罢工，要求当局取消禁止工人罢工的反动法令，同时声援美资“利华兄弟公司”工人的罢工。这家美资公司的工人为了要求当局承认他们的工会组织，曾经在六天以前举行了罢工。由于汽车公司工人的罢工，特里尼达岛的公共交通陷于瘫痪。
    在厄瓜多尔，连接首都基多和最大城市瓜亚基尔公路干线上的克维多城的汽车司机在六月上旬举行罢工，要求改善经济待遇和废除不合理的捐税。汽车司机的罢工使这条重要公路的交通完全中断。厄瓜多尔官方承认，由于罢工，运载香蕉的数百辆卡车无法行驶，使七十万箱香蕉有腐烂的危险。克维多城汽车司机的罢工陆续扩展到这条公路干线和支线的其他重要城镇。汽车司机的罢工得到瓜亚斯、同古拉瓦、皮钦查等五省工会的支持。克维多城的人民在十三日还举行了声援汽车司机的总罢工和总罢市。
    在牙买加首都，金斯敦港领港员二十一日举行罢工，要求增加工资。
    智利约六千名造纸工人为改善生活待遇，已经坚持了一个多月的罢工。
    新华社二十六日讯拉巴斯消息：玻利维亚第二大城市科恰班巴的学生二十四日晚举行示威游行，纪念去年六月在卡塔维、二十世纪和瓦努尼等重要锡矿区，为反抗亲美独裁政权的血腥镇压而惨遭屠杀的矿工。
    示威学生在发表的讲话中，强烈谴责了亲美独裁政权和美帝国主义。他们还不顾反动警察的镇压，愤怒地用石块袭击了美国领事馆、美国“和平队”的办事处和省政府，并烧毁了“和平队”办事处的卷宗。
    与此同时，拉巴斯圣安德烈斯大学的革命学生也举行了示威游行。参加示威游行的学生发表了激烈反对亲美独裁政权的讲话，并焚烧了军事独裁者的模拟人像。
    去年六月二十四日清晨，被玻利维亚矿工开展的反美反独裁斗争吓破了胆的巴里恩托斯亲美独裁政权，悍然出动大批军队，强行占领卡塔维、二十世纪和瓦努尼等全国最大的矿区，并对英勇开展斗争的矿工进行血腥屠杀，造成流血惨案。但是，一年来富有光荣斗争传统的玻利维亚矿工不畏强暴，继续不断开展斗争。
