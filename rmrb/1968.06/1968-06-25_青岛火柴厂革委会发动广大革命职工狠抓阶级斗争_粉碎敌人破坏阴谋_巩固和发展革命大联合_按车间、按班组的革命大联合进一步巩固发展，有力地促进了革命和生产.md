The Qingdao Match Factory Revolutionary Committee has mobilized the masses to expose and smash the plots of a handful of class enemies to split the ranks of the proletarian revolutionary forces. This has further consolidated and developed the revolutionary unity within the factory, divided by workshops and teams, and has powerfully promoted the advancement of the revolution and production throughout the factory.

A Xinhua News Agency report from Jinan on June 23rd stated that after the Qingdao Match Factory achieved revolutionary unity based on the principles of Mao Zedong Thought, divided by workshops and teams, the class enemies, unwilling to admit defeat, used every means to sabotage this revolutionary unity. They attempted to split the ranks of the proletarian revolutionary forces. In response to this situation, the factory revolutionary committee promptly mobilized the masses to study Chairman Mao's instructions on revolutionary unity, raising everyone's awareness. They exposed the plots of the class enemies to sabotage revolutionary unity and rooted out a handful of class enemies who were sabotaging revolutionary unity. This further consolidated and developed the revolutionary unity within the factory, divided by workshops and teams.

The consolidation and development of revolutionary unity within the factory, divided by workshops and teams, has powerfully promoted the deep and sustained development of the revolutionary criticism movement throughout the factory. Previously, there were many mass organizations that spanned workshops and teams throughout the factory, making it difficult to conduct revolutionary criticism in conjunction with various central tasks. After achieving revolutionary unity within the factory, divided by workshops and teams, the situation changed. Before achieving revolutionary unity within the team, the packing group in Workshop 3 could not convene revolutionary criticism meetings. Now, they have established Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and everyone is working together, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, to fiercely criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist goods promoted by China's Khrushchev, such as "material incentives," and to resolutely eliminate their poisonous influence. Revolutionary criticism has promoted the revolutionary transformation of the workers' thinking and has powerfully advanced production.

Achieving revolutionary unity within the factory, divided by workshops and teams, has also closely linked revolutionary criticism with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit. Previously, due to the implementation of China's Khrushchev's revisionist line in enterprise management, the factory had a bloated structure with overlapping layers. This factory of less than 1,500 people had set up "nine departments, one office, two bureaus, and four workshops," with over 120 management personnel. Before achieving revolutionary unity within the factory, divided by workshops and teams, reforms could not be carried out. After achieving revolutionary unity, revolutionary workers criticized China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line while carrying out reforms, implementing a streamlined and efficient management system. The number of full-time personnel was reduced from over 120 to 17, achieving a small leadership team and few full-time personnel, greatly promoting the revolutionary transformation of the leadership team.

Due to the consolidation of revolutionary unity within the factory, divided by workshops and teams, the struggle against the enemy has been further deepened, striking a heavy blow against a handful of class enemies. The revolutionary workers in various workshops, teams, and departments have united as one, taking the initiative to launch continuous attacks against the class enemies, rooting out traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries who had infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, and waging resolute struggles against them.

The practice of this factory has proven that in implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, the superiority of achieving revolutionary unity within the factory, divided by workshops and teams, has been fully demonstrated. Currently, each workshop in this factory, with teams as the base, has established various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Workers study together during work hours and study Chairman Mao's latest instructions together after work, quickly implementing them in action. So far, 85% of the workers in the entire factory have participated in the study, producing a large number of active learners and users of Chairman Mao's works and advanced collectives. Last year, this factory overfulfilled the state's production plan. This year, the output value and quantity have increased compared to the same period last year.

    青岛火柴厂革委会发动广大革命职工狠抓阶级斗争
    粉碎敌人破坏阴谋　巩固和发展革命大联合
    按车间、按班组的革命大联合进一步巩固发展，有力地促进了革命和生产
    新华社济南二十三日电　青岛火柴厂革命委员会发动群众，揭露和粉碎一小撮阶级敌人分裂无产阶级革命队伍的阴谋，使全厂按车间、按班组的革命大联合，得到了进一步巩固和发展，有力地推动了全厂革命和生产的胜利进行。
    青岛火柴厂在毛泽东思想的原则基础上实现了按车间、按班组的革命大联合以后，阶级敌人不甘心失败，千方百计破坏这种革命大联合，妄图分裂无产阶级革命队伍。针对这种情况，厂革命委员会及时发动群众学习了毛主席有关革命大联合的指示，提高了大家的认识，揭露了阶级敌人破坏革命大联合的阴谋，揪出了破坏革命大联合的一小撮阶级敌人，进一步巩固和发展了按车间、按班组的革命大联合。
    按车间、按班组革命大联合的巩固和发展，有力地促进了这个厂革命大批判深入持久地开展。过去，全厂存在着许多跨车间、跨班组的群众组织，使革命大批判很难结合各项中心工作持久深入地进行。按车间、按班组实现革命大联合以后，情况改变了。三车间装盒小组在按班组实现革命大联合以前，革命大批判会召集不起来。现在他们办起了毛泽东思想学习班，大家齐心协力，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫推行的“物质刺激”等反革命修正主义黑货，坚决肃清其流毒。革命大批判，促进了职工思想革命化，有力地推动了生产。
    按车间、班组实现革命大联合，还使革命大批判和本单位斗批改紧密结合了起来。过去这个厂在企业管理上由于推行中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线，机构臃肿，层次重叠。这个不到一千五百人的厂子，就设置了“九科、一室、二部、四车间”，管理人员多达一百二十多人。按车间、按班组实现革命大联合以前，无法进行改革。实现革命大联合以后，革命职工们边批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，边进行改革，实行精兵简政，脱产人员从一百二十多人减少到十七人，做到了领导班子小，脱产人员少，大大促进了领导班子的思想革命化。
    由于巩固了按车间、按班组的革命大联合，还有力地推动了对敌斗争的深入开展，狠狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人。各车间、班组、科室的广大革命职工团结一致，主动地、不停顿地向阶级敌人发起进攻，把混入革命队伍的叛徒、特务、反革命分子，一个个揪了出来，对他们进行了坚决的斗争。
    这个厂的实践证明，在落实毛主席的一系列最新指示中，充分显示出按车间、按班组实现革命大联合的优越性。目前，这个厂各车间都以班组为基点，举办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。职工们上班一起劳动，下班共同学习毛主席的最新指示，迅速落实到行动上。到目前为止，全厂百分之八十五的工人参加了学习，涌现出了大批的活学活用毛主席著作积极分子和先进集体。去年，这个厂超额完成了国家生产计划。今年以来的产值、产量又比去年同时期提高。
