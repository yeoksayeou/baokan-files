The struggle of the youth and workers of West Germany and West Berlin against the "Emergency Powers Act" of the West German ruling clique, aimed at accelerating fascism, is surging forward like an irresistible tide, swelling and rising rapidly. Since the 27th, it has reached an unprecedented new peak.

The West German government, ignoring the strong opposition of the West German people, openly concocted the reactionary "Emergency Powers Act" to hasten the implementation of fascist rule within the country. This has aroused the great indignation of a broad section of students, workers, and progressive people. Recently, tens of thousands of people in forty cities across West Germany and residents of West Berlin have used various forms of struggle, such as strikes, school occupations, demonstrations, and rallies, to fiercely counter the blatant provocation of the reactionary ruling authorities. At present, the anti-fascist struggle of the people of West Germany and West Berlin is rolling forward and continuing to develop.

In the West German capital of Bonn, 2,500 students held a massive protest demonstration on the 30th, the same day the West German parliament passed the "Emergency Powers Act." The previous evening, when West German President Lubke attended a gathering at the Bonn City Theater, 300 young students staged a protest demonstration at the theater entrance, booing him and demanding a debate. The students' actions frightened Lubke, who, under police protection, hurriedly escaped through the back door and fled back to the presidential palace in a police car.

In Frankfurt, students who had occupied Frankfurt University for four consecutive days engaged in fierce struggles with a large number of police who came to suppress them on the 30th, resulting in the arrest of 20 students. Earlier, 15,000 students and residents of Frankfurt held a mass rally on the 27th, with a large, eye-catching red banner hanging on the stage: "Oppose the Emergency Powers Act, Demand Democracy!" In Hamburg, on the 28th, more than 10,000 young people and residents, despite the use of high-pressure water cannons by a large number of police, marched towards the city hall with red flags. The demonstrators climbed the tall building of the city hall and, amidst the enthusiastic applause of the crowd, hoisted a vibrant red flag to the top of the building. The youth of Hamburg also occupied the city theater on the 30th. In Munich, several hundred young students held a rally on the 27th, drawing a swastika symbolizing Hitler's fascist rule on a large banner, with the words: "No to 1933 (the year Hitler came to power) repeating!" On the evening of the 28th, more than 10,000 young people and citizens of Munich held a protest rally, and on the 29th and 30th, thousands of students and workers took to the streets, causing traffic to come to a standstill. Some demonstrating students also entered the train station on the 30th, causing many trains to be unable to operate. In Stuttgart, 6,000 residents held a protest rally against the "Emergency Powers Act" on the 28th. On the same day, 3,000 workers and students in Cologne jointly held a demonstration march. In addition, in the West German cities of Hanover, Bochum, Göttingen, and others, thousands of students and workers took to the streets together, holding protest demonstrations. The students and workers of West Berlin also held demonstrations in the city on the 29th and 30th.

While holding demonstrations and protest rallies, students across West Germany and West Berlin also used strikes and school occupations to express their angry protests. Since the 27th, almost all university students have gone on strike, and many high schools have been forced to suspend classes due to students participating in the protest struggle. Students of Frankfurt University declared a strike after occupying the university on the 26th. Students hung a large banner on the eleven-story teaching building, solemnly declaring: "The university belongs to the people!" On the 29th, students of this university changed the school name to "Karl Marx University," pasting the words "Karl Marx University" written on paper over the original school name. All 17 middle schools in Frankfurt were also unable to hold classes on the 29th. Students of the University of Kassel also occupied their school and announced a name change.

In West Berlin, students of various universities began a three-day strike on the 27th. Some students occupied schools, blocking classroom doors with desks and chairs, planting red flags on various school buildings, writing revolutionary slogans on the walls with red paint, and broadcasting the "Internationale" from windows with loudspeakers to protest the "Emergency Powers Act."

Students from many universities and high schools across West Germany and West Berlin have formed many propaganda teams to expose the evil purposes of the "Emergency Powers Act" to workers and the general public. On the evening of the 28th, more than 2,000 students in West Berlin went to the West Berlin Theater to propagate to the audience, but were brutally suppressed by West Berlin police. However, the students bravely fought back, throwing stones and angrily denouncing the police who came to suppress them as Nazis. The demonstrators also angrily tore up a West German flag. West Berlin students have recently gone to many cities within West Germany, including Bonn, to perform street plays opposing U.S. imperialism, West German monopolistic capital, and the "Emergency Powers Act," receiving enthusiastic welcomes from the audience. Young students in Munich, Hamburg, Bochum, Aachen, and other places also marched into various theaters and cinemas with red flags, despite police suppression, to propagate.

Under the influence and impetus of the just struggle of the youth and students of West Germany and West Berlin, the broad masses of West German workers, despite various threats and obstacles from the yellow union leaders, have also taken to the streets in strikes and rallies, echoing the students' struggle. On the 28th and 29th, 200 workers at the Mannheim steel plant, 300 metal workers in Duisburg, all bus drivers in Münster, 200 printing workers in Stuttgart, and workers in the municipal management department of Kassel held strikes to protest the "Emergency Powers Act." On the 28th, 3,000 workers in Mannheim also held a rally to protest the "Emergency Powers Act," shouting in unison: "General Strike!" On the 28th, 2,000 workers in Hanover also held a rally demanding a general strike.

At the same time, writers, actors, and other strata of West German and West Berlin residents are also joining the struggle against the "Emergency Powers Act." Recently, some professors and writers in West Germany and West Berlin have jointly sent a telegram to the West German parliament opposing the "Emergency Powers Act." On the evening of the 28th, during a performance at a theater in West Berlin, a troupe from Munich read a strongly worded letter protesting the "Emergency Powers Act" to the audience. After the performance, they also had a long discussion with the audience and students who came to the theater to propagate.

    四十个城市数十万群众和西柏林居民连日罢工、罢课猛烈回击反动当局炮制法西斯法案的挑衅
    学生占领学校并上街示威，工人冲破黄色工会头目阻挠奋起罢工同学生斗争相呼应
    据新华社波恩三十日电　西德和西柏林市的青年学生和工人反对西德统治集团用来加速法西斯化的“紧急状态法”的斗争，正象不可阻挡的怒潮，汹涌澎湃、迅速高涨，自二十七日以来，再次出现了前所未有的新高峰。
    西德政府不顾西德人民的强烈反对，公然炮制“紧急状态法”这一反动法案，加紧在国内实行法西斯统治的做法，激起了广大学生、工人和各界进步人士的极大愤慨。最近，西德全国四十个城市的数十万群众和西柏林市的居民，用罢课、罢工、占领学校、示威游行和集会等多种多样的斗争行动，猛烈回击了反动统治当局这一明目张胆的挑衅。目前，西德和西柏林群众的这一反法西斯斗争正在滚滚向前，继续发展。
    在西德首都波恩，二千五百名学生在西德议会三十日通过“紧急状态法”的同时，举行了声势浩大的抗议示威。前一天晚上，当西德总统吕布克到波恩市剧院出席一个集会时，三百名青年学生在剧院门口举行抗议示威，向他发出嘘声，要同他进行辩论。学生们的行动吓得吕布克狼狈不堪，慌忙在警察保护下从后门溜走，钻进一辆警车逃回总统府。
    在法兰克福，连续四天占领了法兰克福大学的学生，三十日同前来镇压的大批警察展开了激烈的搏斗，有二十名学生被逮捕。在这以前，法兰克福的一万五千名学生和居民二十七日举行了群众大会，主席台上悬挂一幅红色醒目的巨大标语：“反对紧急状态法，要民主！”在汉堡，二十八日有一万余名青年和居民，不顾大批警察用高压水龙车喷射，打着红旗向市政大厅挺进。示威者攀登上市政大厅的高楼，在群众的热烈掌声中把一面鲜艳的红旗升上大楼的顶端。汉堡的青年还在三十日占领了市剧院。在慕尼黑，数百名青年学生二十七日举行集会，他们在一面巨幅标语上画着一个象征希特勒法西斯统治的“卐”标志，上面写着：“不许一九三三年（希特勒上台的一年）重演！”二十八日晚，有一万余名慕尼黑青年和市民举行了抗议集会，二十九日和三十日，又分别有数千名学生和工人走上街头，使交通陷于瘫痪。部分示威青年学生还在三十日进入火车站，使许多火车无法开行。在斯图加特，六千名居民二十八日举行了抗议大会反对“紧急状态法”。同一天，科隆的三千名工人和学生联合举行示威游行。此外，在西德的汉诺威、波鸿、哥丁根等城市，都有成千的学生和工人并肩走上了街头，举行抗议示威。西柏林的学生和工人也在二十九日和三十日连续在市内举行了示威。
    在举行示威游行和抗议集会的同时，西德全国和西柏林的学生还采用罢课、占领学校等斗争方式来表示他们愤怒的抗议。自二十七日以来，几乎全部高等学校的学生都举行了罢课，许多中学也因学生参加了抗议斗争而被迫停课。法兰克福大学的学生二十六日占领大学宣布罢课。学生在高达十一层的教学大楼上悬挂巨幅标语，庄严宣布：“大学属于人民！”二十九日，这所大学的学生把校名改为“卡尔·马克思大学”，他们用纸张写上“卡尔·马克思大学”的字样贴在原来的旧校名上。法兰克福的全部十七所中学二十九日也无法上课。基森的大学生也占领了自己的学校并宣布更改校名。
    在西柏林，各高等学校的学生二十七日开始罢课三天。有些学生占领了学校，用桌椅堵住教室的大门，在学校各建筑物上插上红旗，用红漆在墙上写上了革命的口号，并用扩音器从窗口向外播送《国际歌》，抗议“紧急状态法”。
    遍及西德全国和西柏林的许多大、中学生还组成许多宣传队，向工人和广大居民揭露“紧急状态法”的罪恶目的。二十八日晚，二千余名西柏林学生到西柏林剧院向观众进行宣传，遭到西柏林警察的蛮横镇压。但是学生们英勇不屈，用石头还击，并且愤怒谴责前来镇压的警察是纳粹。示威者还愤怒地撕碎了一面西德国旗。西柏林学生近几天还到西德境内的波恩等许多城市，演出反对美帝国主义、反对西德垄断资本和反对“紧急状态法”的活报剧，受到观众的热烈欢迎。慕尼黑、汉堡、波鸿、亚琛等地的青年学生也都打着红旗，不顾警察的镇压，进入各剧场和电影院进行宣传。
    在西德和西柏林青年学生的正义斗争的影响和推动下，广大西德工人也不顾黄色工会头目的种种威胁和阻挠，纷纷举行罢工和集会，同学生的斗争相互呼应。曼海姆炼铁厂的二百名工人，杜依斯堡三百名五金工人，明斯特的全部公共汽车司机，斯图加特的二百名印刷工人和基森市政管理部门的工人都分别在二十八日和二十九日举行了抗议“紧急状态法”的罢工。曼海姆的三千名工人还在二十八日举行集会抗议“紧急状态法”。他们齐声高呼：“总罢工！”汉诺威的二千名工人二十八日也举行集会要求总罢工。
    与此同时，作家、演员和其他阶层的西德和西柏林居民，也正在纷纷参加到反对“紧急状态法”的斗争中去，西德和西柏林的一些教授、作家最近都联名打电报给西德议会反对“紧急状态法”。正在西柏林一个剧院演出的一个慕尼黑剧团的职工，二十八日晚在演出节目时，向观众宣读了一封强烈抗议“紧急状态法”的信。在演出结束后，他们还和观众以及前来剧院进行宣传的学生进行了长时间的讨论。
