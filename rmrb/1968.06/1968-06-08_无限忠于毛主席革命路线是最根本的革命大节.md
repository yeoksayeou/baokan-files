In the midst of the triumphant songs celebrating the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we enthusiastically hail the great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin's personal approval, and the order issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, posthumously awarding Comrade Men He with the glorious title of "a good cadre who is unswervingly loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." Comrade Men He is unswervingly loyal to the people, unswervingly loyal to the Party, unswervingly loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and unswervingly loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. He is a shining example for us to learn from.

Throughout his revolutionary life, Comrade Men He put into practice his own oath: "Think of everything in terms of Chairman Mao, obey everything under Chairman Mao, follow everything in accordance with Chairman Mao, and do everything for Chairman Mao." These four "everything" are the starting point and the conclusion of all of Comrade Men He's words and deeds, and the guiding principle for all of his words and deeds. To learn from Comrade Men He, we must first learn from his noble quality of being unswervingly loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and regard the resolute execution and courageous defense of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line as our most sacred duty.

The class struggle under the dictatorship of the proletariat is most prominently and concentratedly manifested in the struggle between the two lines within the Party. Chairman Mao teaches us: "It is either the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind, or the West Wind prevailing over the East Wind. There is no room for compromise on the question of line." In the life-and-death struggle between the two lines, everyone must make a choice, either standing on this side or that side, with no middle ground to take. Whether one is unswervingly loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is a fundamental issue of standpoint. If this fundamental standpoint is wrong, everything else will be wrong. To be a good student of Chairman Mao, one must have a high level of proletarian consciousness and a high level of consciousness in the struggle between the two lines. Only by being like Comrade Men He, unswervingly loyal to Chairman Mao and unswervingly loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, can one, in the midst of the fierce and complex class struggle, follow the great leader Chairman Mao closely, stand firm, distinguish between friends and enemies, discern right from wrong, and proceed in the correct direction from victory to victory.

For cadres participating in the revolutionary committees, being unswervingly loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has even greater significance. After the establishment of the revolutionary committees, it is necessary to follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions to "organize a revolutionary and mass-linked leading cadre group." Vice Chairman Lin points out: the leading cadre group is the power. Therefore, the revolutionization of the leading cadre group is a key issue related to whether the newly born revolutionary committees can be consolidated and developed. The most important condition for the revolutionization of the leading cadre group is to raise the awareness of being unswervingly loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Learning, propagating, executing, and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the most sacred duty of the leading cadres of the revolutionary committees. Comrade Men He said well, "Always stand guard for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, stand sentry, and fight the battle." Comrade Men He's heroic oath and revolutionary practice set a clear and sharp requirement for our ideological revolutionization, and established a brilliant example. We must, like Comrade Men He, in the practice of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, study Chairman Mao's works with great eagerness, persist in the good style of learning and applying, and combining learning with practice. We must, with our unswerving loyalty to Chairman Mao, achieve consistency between learning and practice, and between words and deeds. Especially, we must strive to learn Chairman Mao's theories, lines, principles, and policies on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must seriously study the "Three Articles," thoroughly transform our worldview. We must study and apply actively in the struggle between the two lines, and strive to criticize and repudiate revisionism and selfishness for the sake of being unswervingly loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We must, according to Chairman Mao's great teaching of "not living on past merits, but creating new ones," dedicate ourselves to the revolution for life, read Chairman Mao's books for life, and transform our thoughts for life. Only in this way can we continuously raise our proletarian class consciousness and consciousness in the struggle between the two lines, and temper ourselves into warriors who consciously carry out the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Only in this way can we hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment closely, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and contribute our strength to the great struggle for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    无限忠于毛主席革命路线是最根本的革命大节
    河北省革命委员会第一副主任　刘子厚
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，我们热烈欢呼伟大统帅毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席亲自批准，由中共中央、中央军委、中央文革发布命令，追授门合同志以“无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部”的光荣称号。门合同志无限忠于人民、无限忠于党、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，是我们学习的光辉榜样。
    门合同志以他革命的一生，实践了他自己的誓言：“一切想着毛主席，一切服从毛主席，一切紧跟毛主席，一切为着毛主席。”这四个“一切”，是门合同志全部言行的出发点和归结点，是指导他全部言行的准则。向门合同志学习，首先要学习他无限忠于毛主席革命路线的崇高品质，把坚决执行和勇敢捍卫毛主席的革命路线，作为自己最神圣的职责。
    无产阶级专政条件下的阶级斗争，最突出、最集中地通过党内两条路线的斗争表现出来。毛主席教导我们：“不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风，在路线问题上没有调和的余地。”在你死我活的两条路线斗争中，每个人都要作出选择，不是站在这一边，就是站在那一边，没有中间道路可走。是不是无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，这是一个根本立场问题。这个根本立场错了，一切就都错了。做毛主席的好学生，必须具有高度的无产阶级觉悟和高度的两条路线斗争觉悟。只有象门合同志那样，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，才能够在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争的大风大浪中，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，站稳立场，分清敌我，明辨是非，沿着正确的方向，从胜利走向胜利。
    无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，对于参加革命委员会的革命干部来说，有更加重大的意义。革命委员会成立以后，必须遵照毛主席的最新指示，“组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”林副主席指出：领导班子就是政权。因此，领导班子的革命化，是关系到新诞生的革命委员会能否巩固和发展的关键问题。实现领导班子的革命化，最重要的一条，就是提高无限忠于毛主席革命路线的觉悟。学习、宣传、执行和捍卫毛主席的革命路线，这是革命委员会领导人员最神圣的职责。门合同志说得好，要“时刻为毛主席的革命路线放好哨，站好岗，打好仗”。门合同志的英雄誓言和革命实践，为我们的思想革命化提出了最明确、最尖锐的要求，树立了光辉的范例。我们一定要象门合同志那样，在阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的实践中，如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作，坚持活学活用、学用结合的优良学风。要以对毛主席的无限忠心，做到学用一致，言行一致。特别要努力学习毛主席关于在无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针和政策。要认真学习“老三篇”，彻底改造世界观。要带着两条路线斗争中的问题活学活用，努力做到为无限忠于毛主席的革命路线而斗私批修。要按照毛主席的“不要吃老本，要立新功”的伟大教导，干一辈子革命，读一辈子毛主席的书，改造一辈子思想。这样，才能不断提高无产阶级的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，锻炼成为在无产阶级专政条件下自觉进行革命的战士。这样，才能更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中贡献出自己的力量。
