The Malian military delegation, led by Malian Republic's Minister-level representative for defense and security Mamadou Diagou, recently visited our great leader Chairman Mao's hometown of Hunan, as well as Guangzhou, accompanied by Vice Minister of National Defense Xiao Jingguang.

The Malian military delegation and the Malian Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Malian Embassy in China, Mussa Kourybaly, who accompanied the delegation, were warmly welcomed by relevant officials Li Yuan and Liu Xingyuan, as well as the soldiers and revolutionary masses of the People's Liberation Army in Hunan and Guangzhou.

On June 9, the Malian military delegation specially visited the hometown of our great leader Chairman Mao—Shaoshan, and toured the exhibition hall of Mao's former residence. After the visit, team leader Mamadou Diagou wrote in the guestbook: "After visiting the holy land of Marxism-Leninism, the hometown of Chairman Mao Zedong, the Malian military delegation was deeply impressed. We listened with great enthusiasm to the introduction of the life of the great fighter and defender of the world proletariat, Chairman Mao Zedong. Everything we saw further convinced us that this genius thinker and leader of humanity will lead China and the whole world on the inevitable path of revolution... Long live Chairman Mao Zedong! Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!"

In Hunan, the Malian military delegation also visited places where Chairman Mao had engaged in early revolutionary activities: the former site of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the former site of the self-study university founded by Mao. In Guangzhou, the delegation visited the former site of the peasant movement training institute established by Mao, watched military and cultural performances by Guangzhou militia, and visited a farm of a certain unit of the Guangzhou military region. The Malian guests were warmly welcomed wherever they went by the soldiers and revolutionary masses of the People's Liberation Army.
