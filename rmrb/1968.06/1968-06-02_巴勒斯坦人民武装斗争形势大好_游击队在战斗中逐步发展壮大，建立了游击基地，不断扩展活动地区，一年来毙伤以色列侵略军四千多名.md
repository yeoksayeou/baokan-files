The armed struggle of the Palestinian people is favorable. Guerrilla forces have grown stronger in battle, established guerrilla bases, and continuously expanded their areas of operation. In the past year, over 4,000 Israeli invaders have been killed or wounded.

According to a report from our correspondent at Xinhua News Agency on June 1st: Over the past year, the Palestinian people have displayed a revolutionary spirit of daring to fight and daring to win. They have taken up arms to launch fierce attacks against the U.S. imperialists' tool, Israel, delivering heavy blows to the U.S.-Israeli invaders. The revolutionary situation in the Middle East is very favorable.

Since the U.S.-Israeli aggression war last June, Palestinian guerrilla forces have launched nearly 400 attacks. They have killed or wounded over 4,000 Israeli military personnel, two American advisors, shot down nine helicopters and one fighter jet, destroyed or blown up 24 tanks, seven trains, 145 half-track military vehicles, and over 200 other military vehicles.

The areas of operation of the guerrilla forces are continuously expanding. With the support of the local people, the guerrilla forces first launched activities in the West Bank of the Jordan River and the Gaza Strip, which were occupied by Israel. After January of this year, they expanded their operations to the Negev Desert and other areas that were under Israeli control before the war. In May, they opened new battlefields in the Sinai Peninsula and other areas. Currently, Palestinian guerrilla forces are active in the vast rural and mountainous regions of the entire area occupied by Israel and the areas under Israeli control before the war. They have even penetrated the outskirts of Tel Aviv, the center of Israeli rule, making the enemy helpless and anxious everywhere.

In the battles, the Palestinian guerrilla forces have gradually grown stronger. More and more nationalist organizations and Palestinian youth, both men and women, have taken up arms to join the fight. The main force of the Palestinian guerrilla forces, "Fatah" (Palestinian Liberation Movement), has further developed armed struggle based on its efforts since 1965. The Palestinian People's Liberation Front and the Palestinian Liberation Organization joined the fight in December last year and February this year, respectively. A large number of Palestinians have enthusiastically joined the guerrilla forces. According to a report from a weekly magazine in Lebanon, since Israel launched a new aggression against Jordan on March 21st this year, 15,000 Palestinian youth have applied to join the "Storm" commando unit affiliated with "Fatah." Workers and farmers from Palestine stand at the forefront of the armed struggle. According to reports, workers and farmers make up about 65% of the members of the guerrilla forces.

With the support of the people, the Palestinian guerrilla forces have established bases in the areas occupied by Israel and the areas under Israeli control before the war, laying a good foundation for sustained struggle in the future. "Fatah" announced in February this year that the guerrilla forces have established bases in the occupied areas, and "now there is no place in Israel that 'Fatah' cannot strike." According to the Egyptian weekly "Ruz al-Yusuf," "there are more than five bases in the occupied Arab territories, and there is one or more bases in Israel itself, especially in the Negev."

In the battles, the guerrilla forces of various Palestinian nationalist organizations have gradually strengthened their unity and cooperation based on the principle of united opposition to the enemy. In January this year, "Fatah," the Palestinian People's Liberation Front, and eight other Palestinian nationalist organizations held a meeting in Cairo to discuss the adoption of unified military actions to strengthen the armed struggle for the liberation of Palestine. The statement issued after the meeting pointed out that "armed struggle is the only way to liberate Palestine," and the Palestinian liberation cause needs to strengthen unity. The statement called on all nationalist organizations, all Palestinian trade unions, and organizations in various industries to strengthen unity to defeat the Zionists. On May 25th, the guerrilla forces of "Fatah" and the Palestinian Liberation Organization launched a joint attack on an Israeli military camp near Jericho, annihilating 120 enemy soldiers and achieving the greatest victory in the armed struggle so far. According to reports, in the past year of battles, the "Storm" commando unit affiliated with "Fatah" has killed or wounded nearly 3,000 enemy soldiers, and the guerrilla forces of other nationalist organizations have also killed or wounded more than 1,000 enemy soldiers.

The guerrilla forces have continuously improved their combat effectiveness and become stronger with each battle. Western news agencies have recently repeatedly exclaimed that the Palestinian guerrilla forces are "highly organized" and have "very meticulous battle plans." According to Arab newspapers, the activities of the guerrilla forces are often carried out at night, and their battles are very brave and swift. Before attacking military targets, they first lay mines around the area; after the attack, they quickly withdraw and deploy forces to ambush the enemy's reinforcements; after completing the mission, they lay another batch of mines and then return to the base with the captured weapons and ammunition. Due to the increasing strength of the guerrilla forces and the continuous improvement of their combat effectiveness, the guerrilla forces can launch attacks in several places on the same day. On May 2nd, the guerrilla forces launched eight attacks in Khan Yunis, Gaza, Jenin, and near the Dead Sea; on May 7th, they launched ten attacks in the West Bank of the Jordan River, Gaza, the Golan Heights, and the outskirts of Jerusalem, making the enemy helpless and disorganized.

The activities of the Palestinian guerrilla forces have received strong support from the people in the occupied areas. The people in the occupied areas actively cooperate with the guerrilla forces in their battles, providing food, treating the wounded, monitoring enemy activities, providing intelligence, guiding the guerrilla forces, and doing everything possible to protect them. A leader of the guerrilla forces said well, "Although we do not have dense forests, the people are our forests." The people of various Arab countries also actively support the Palestinian guerrilla forces. Many young people volunteer to join the Palestinian guerrilla forces, and in Syria, Iraq, Egypt, and Lebanon, many young people want to join the Palestinian guerrilla forces.

The armed struggle of the Palestinian people is an integral part of the struggle of people around the world against U.S. imperialism. Every victory achieved by the Palestinian people in their struggle is a blow to the U.S. imperialists' counter-revolutionary global strategy. Over the past year, U.S. President Johnson has repeatedly expressed "concern" about the situation in the Middle East. The U.S. representative to the United Nations, Goldberg, once bluntly said that the Middle East is the "second conflict region" after Vietnam. The deepening and development of the armed struggle of the Palestinian people have made U.S. imperialism even more anxious. According to a report from an Egyptian publication, the U.S. is surprised by the losses suffered by Israel every day due to the attacks of the Palestinian guerrilla forces and the Israeli military, and it is extremely wrong to underestimate the importance and influence of the Arab resistance movement.

In the face of heavy blows from the Palestinian guerrilla forces, the panic-stricken Israeli reactionary authorities have held several cabinet meetings to discuss the issue of dealing with the guerrilla forces, attempting to achieve their plot to eliminate the guerrilla forces by attacking the guerrilla bases. However, the Israeli invading army has not gained any advantage in its attacks on the guerrilla bases but has suffered heavy casualties. Israeli Prime Minister Eshkol is even more frustrated, saying that in dealing with the guerrilla issue, it will be "more difficult than last June. This war will be a long one."

Great Leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "No matter how large or small a country is, as long as it fully mobilizes the people, firmly relies on the people, and wages a people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated." The widespread dissemination of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought among the Arab people has greatly inspired the struggle of the Palestinian guerrilla forces, making them dare to despise the seemingly powerful U.S. imperialism and its tool of aggression, Israel. A leader of "Fatah" said: "As Chairman Mao pointed out, imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. Israel's new aggression does not indicate the strength of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, but rather indicates their weakness."

The armed struggle of the Palestinian people is thriving, and although they will encounter many difficulties and twists and turns on the road ahead, as a leader of "Fatah" said: "No matter how many difficulties we may encounter, we are determined to fight on." The struggle of the Palestinian people is just, and victory will surely belong to the Palestinian people who dare to persist in a long-term armed struggle.

    巴勒斯坦人民武装斗争形势大好
    游击队在战斗中逐步发展壮大，建立了游击基地，不断扩展活动地区，一年来毙伤以色列侵略军四千多名
    据新华社一日讯　本社记者报道：一年来，巴勒斯坦人民发扬敢于战斗、敢于胜利的革命精神，拿起武器，向美帝国主义的侵略工具以色列发动了猛烈的进攻，给美以侵略者以沉重打击。目前中东地区革命形势一片大好。
    从去年六月美以侵略战争以来，巴勒斯坦游击队先后发动了将近四百次的袭击，共打死打伤以色列侵略军官兵四千多名，美国顾问两名，击落直升飞机九架、战斗机一架，击毁和炸毁坦克二十四辆、火车七列、半履带式军车一百四十五辆以及其他军用车辆二百多辆。
    游击队的活动地区正在不断扩大。在当地人民的支持下，游击队首先在被以色列侵占的约旦河西岸地区和加沙地带展开活动。今年一月以后，又发展到内格夫沙漠等战前以色列的统治区，五月份又在西奈半岛等地开辟了新战场。目前，巴勒斯坦游击队已驰骋在整个以色列占领区和战前以色列统治区的广大农村和山区，甚至深入到以色列统治中心特拉维夫的近郊，打得敌人到处穷于应付，惶惶不安。
    巴勒斯坦游击队在战斗中逐步发展壮大，越来越多的民族主义组织和巴勒斯坦男女青年拿起武器投入战斗。巴勒斯坦游击队的主力——“法塔赫”（巴勒斯坦解放运动）在一九六五年开展武装斗争的基础上，在战后不久把武装斗争更进一步地开展起来。巴勒斯坦人民解放阵线和巴勒斯坦解放组织也分别于去年十二月和今年二月投入战斗。大批的巴勒斯坦人民踊跃参加游击队，据黎巴嫩的一家周刊报道，从今年三月二十一日以色列向约旦发动新侵略以后，已有一万五千名巴勒斯坦青年申请参加“法塔赫”所属军事组织“暴风”突击队。巴勒斯坦的工人农民站在武装斗争的最前列，据报道，在游击队的成员中，工人和农民约占百分之六十五。
    巴勒斯坦游击队在人民群众的支持下，在以色列侵占区和战前以色列统治区内建立了游击基地，为今后进行持久斗争打下了良好的基础。“法塔赫”在今年二月宣布，游击队已在敌占区内建立了游击基地，“现在在以色列再也没有‘法塔赫’所打击不到的地方了。”据阿联的《鲁兹·优素福》周刊报道：“在被占领的阿拉伯领土内有五个以上的基地，在以色列本身，特别是在内格夫，就有一个或更多的基地。”
    在战斗中，巴勒斯坦各民族主义组织所属的游击队本着一致对敌的原则，逐步加强了团结和联系。今年一月，“法塔赫”、巴勒斯坦人民解放阵线等八个巴勒斯坦民族主义组织在开罗开会，讨论了采取统一的军事行动以加强解放巴勒斯坦的武装斗争的问题。会后的声明指出，“武装斗争是解放巴勒斯坦的唯一方法”，巴勒斯坦解放事业需要加强团结。声明呼吁各民族主义组织、所有的巴勒斯坦工会以及各行业的组织加强团结，以战胜犹太复国主义者。五月二十五日，“法塔赫”和巴勒斯坦解放组织两个组织的游击队对杰里科附近的以色列兵营发动联合进攻，歼灭敌人一百二十名，取得了开展武装斗争以来歼敌最多的一次胜利。据报道，在过去一年的战斗中，“法塔赫”所属军事组织“暴风”突击队打死打伤敌军近三千名，其它民族主义组织所属的游击队也打死打伤敌人一千多名。
    游击队在战斗中不断提高战斗水平，越战越强。西方通讯社最近不断惊呼，巴勒斯坦游击队“是高度有组织的”，“战斗计划十分周密”。据阿拉伯报纸报道，游击队的活动常常在深夜进行，战斗十分勇敢，动作非常神速。他们在对军事目标袭击前，先在周围埋设地雷；袭击后迅速转移，并部署兵力伏击敌人的援军；在完成任务后，再埋上一批地雷，然后携带缴获的武器弹药返回基地。由于游击队的日益壮大和战斗水平的不断提高，游击队已能在同一天内，在几个地方发动袭击。五月二日，游击队在汗尤尼斯、加沙、杰宁、死海附近等地发动了八次袭击；五月七日，又在约旦河西岸、加沙、戈兰高地、耶路撒冷郊区等地进行了十次袭击，打得敌人穷于应付，狼狈不堪。
    巴勒斯坦游击队的活动得到了占领区内人民的大力支持。占领区的人民积极配合游击队的战斗，向游击队提供粮食，治疗伤员，监视敌军的活动，为游击队提供情报，给游击队当向导，并且千方百计地掩护他们。一位游击队的领导人说得好，我们虽然没有茂密的森林，但是人民群众就是我们的森林。阿拉伯各国人民也积极支持巴勒斯坦游击队。许多青年志愿参加巴勒斯坦游击队，在叙利亚、伊拉克、阿联、黎巴嫩，许多青年要求参加巴勒斯坦游击队。
    巴勒斯坦人民武装斗争是全世界人民反对美帝国主义斗争的一个组成部分，巴勒斯坦人民在斗争中取得的每一个胜利，都是对美帝国主义的反革命全球战略的打击。一年来，美国总统约翰逊对中东局势不断表示“关切”，美国驻联合国代表戈德堡曾直言不讳地说，中东是仅次于越南的“第二个冲突地区”。巴勒斯坦人民武装斗争的日益深入和发展，使美帝国主义更加惴惴不安。据阿联一家刊物报道，美国对“以色列每天都由于巴勒斯坦游击队的袭击和以色列军队遭到的损失感到意外，……缩小阿拉伯抵抗运动的重要性及其影响是极其错误的。”
    在不断遭到巴勒斯坦游击队的沉重打击的情况下，惊慌失措的以色列反动当局曾经几次召开内阁会议专门讨论对付游击队问题，妄图用进攻巴勒斯坦游击队的游击基地的办法，以实现它消灭游击队的阴谋。但是，以色列侵略军在对游击队基地发动的进攻中，不但没有得到便宜，反而遭到了重大的伤亡。以色列总理艾希科尔更是懊丧地说，在对付游击队问题上，要比去年六月“更加艰苦。这场战争将是长期的。”
    伟大领袖毛主席指出：“国家不分大小，只要充分动员人民，坚决依靠人民，进行人民战争，任何强大的敌人都是可以打败的。”战无不胜的毛泽东思想在阿拉伯人民中的广泛传播，极大地激励了巴勒斯坦游击队的斗争，使他们敢于藐视貌似强大的美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列。一位“法塔赫”领导人说：“正如毛主席指出的那样，帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎，以色列的新侵略并不表明美帝国主义及其走狗的强大，相反却表明它的虚弱。”
    巴勒斯坦人民的武装斗争方兴未艾，在前进的道路上虽然还会遇到许多困难和曲折，但是正如“法塔赫”的一位领导人所说：“不管我们可能碰到多少困难，我们都决心战斗下去。”巴勒斯坦人民的斗争是正义的，胜利一定属于敢于坚持长期武装斗争的巴勒斯坦人民。
