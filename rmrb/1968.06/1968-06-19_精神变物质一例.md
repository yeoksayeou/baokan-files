Chen Wangcai had a knot in his mind, and the radio he was responsible for maintaining also malfunctioned. In the study class, comrades from the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team helped Chen Wangcai untie the knot in his mind, and the radio malfunction was also resolved. This is an example of spirit becoming matter.

Our great teacher Chairman Mao teaches us: "The correct ideas of the advanced class, once grasped by the masses, become a material force for changing society and the world."

We must place the study and application of Chairman Mao's works and the thorough transformation of people's ideology in the highest position. We must arm people's minds with Mao Zedong Thought. Only by truly mastering Mao Zedong Thought can people eliminate selfishness and extraneous thoughts, devote themselves wholeheartedly to serving the people, and produce the material force capable of creating "any miracle in the world."

    精神变物质一例
    陈望才思想上结了疙瘩，他负责维修的广播器也发生了故障。在学习班里，解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的同志帮助陈望才把思想上的疙瘩解开了，广播器的故障也就跟着排除了。这是精神变物质的一例。
    我们伟大的导师毛主席教导我们：“代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量。”
    我们一定要把活学活用毛主席著作，搞好人的思想革命化，放在高于一切的地位，用毛泽东思想武装人的头脑。只有真正掌握了毛泽东思想，人们才能排除私心杂念，全心全意为人民服务，才能产生“什么人间奇迹也可以造出来”的物质力量。
