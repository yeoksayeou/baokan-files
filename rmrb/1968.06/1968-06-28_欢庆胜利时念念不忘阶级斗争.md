After the establishment of the revolutionary committees, do we still need to fiercely grasp class struggle? Do we still need to fiercely criticize the theory of "class struggle extinguished"? Our experience is:

Never Forget Class Struggle While Celebrating Victory

Political Commissar, Certain Unit of the PLA, Xǔ Chāngqí

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power." The establishment of the revolutionary committees marks the decisive victory of the power struggle by the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. However, this victory has not yet been finally consolidated. The class enemies are always dreaming of seizing back the power they have lost. While under the command of Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters, the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses must take the initiative to attack the class enemies, defending and consolidating the revolutionary power.

China's Khrushchev once vigorously advocated the theory of "class struggle extinguished," precisely to oppose the proletariat's struggle against the bourgeoisie, attempting to use this smokescreen to cover the bourgeoisie's attack on the proletariat, overthrow the proletarian power, and restore capitalism. We must expose his tricks and thoroughly criticize his counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies!

Our unit, during the "supporting the left" work in Wuzhong County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, supporting the broad revolutionary leftist masses, and launching an attack on traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist-roaders. When the Cultural Revolution began in the Wuzhong area, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party played tricks and shot dark arrows, inciting the masses to fight each other, and in the matter of cadres, "striking a large group and protecting a small group," attempting to retain the power they had usurped. When the broad revolutionary rebels seized power from them, they staged a fake seizure of power, supporting one faction and striking another, inciting armed struggles. At this moment, the People's Liberation Army responded to the great call of our heart's red sun, Chairman Mao, supporting the broad leftist masses, and finally seized all the party, government, financial, and cultural powers from the capitalist-roaders, establishing the Wuzhong County Revolutionary Committee. This is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought!

Regarding the birth of the revolutionary committee, the people of the entire county are all jubilant and celebrating the victory with drumbeats. But the class enemies are terrified and enraged. They regroup their forces in the midst of the celebratory drumbeats, preparing for a counterattack. Those traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist-roaders who have been knocked down by the broad revolutionary masses are like a pack of drowning dogs, crawling back to shore and barking wildly, spreading a strong wind of reversing verdicts. Some even attempt to infiltrate the revolutionary committee, using bourgeois factionalism to engage in splittist activities. The untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in society are shouting slogans and spreading rumors and slander about the revolutionary committee.

Facing this serious new situation and new trend in class struggle, we firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle," fiercely criticizing China's Khrushchev's fallacy of "class struggle extinguished," firmly grasping the line of class struggle, and launching an attack on the class enemies. We deeply understand that we must never relax our struggle against the enemy; if we relax our struggle against the enemy, there is the danger of losing the revolutionary power again.

"Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's great teachings, never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, defend the newly born revolutionary committee, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

### 欢庆胜利时念念不忘阶级斗争

    兰州部队活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子大批判文选
    在革命委员会建立以后，还要不要狠抓阶级斗争，还要不要狠批“阶级斗争熄灭”论，我们的体会是：
    欢庆胜利时念念不忘阶级斗争
    解放军某部政委　许昌其
    毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”革命委员会的建立，标志着无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争取得了决定性的胜利。但是，这个胜利还没有最后巩固下来。阶级敌人时刻都在梦想夺回他们已经失去的政权。而无产阶级和广大革命群众，在以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部指挥下，就是要向阶级敌人主动进攻，保卫和巩固革命政权。
    中国赫鲁晓夫曾经大肆鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭”论，就是为了反对无产阶级向资产阶级斗争，妄图用这种烟幕弹，掩护资产阶级向无产阶级进攻，颠覆无产阶级政权，复辟资本主义。我们一定要揭穿他的阴谋诡计，把他的反革命修正主义谬论批倒批臭！
    我们部队在宁夏回族自治区吴忠县“支左”工作中，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，支持广大革命左派群众，向叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派发动进攻。吴忠地区文化大革命一开始，党内一小撮走资派就耍阴谋，放暗箭，挑动群众斗群众，在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”，企图保住他们窃取的权力。当广大革命造反派向他们夺权的时候，他们又进行假夺权，支持一派，打击一派，挑动武斗。正在这时候，人民解放军响应我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的伟大号召，支持左派广大群众，终于从走资派手里夺回了一切党、政、财、文大权，成立了吴忠县革命委员会。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！
    对于革命委员会的诞生，全县人民无不欢欣鼓舞，敲锣打鼓地庆贺胜利。但阶级敌人却怕得要死，恨得要命。他们就在这欢庆胜利的锣鼓声中重新集聚力量，准备进行反扑。那些已被广大革命群众打翻在地的叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派，象一群落水狗，又爬上岸来狂吠，大刮翻案风。有的甚至妄图钻进革命委员会，利用资产阶级派性，进行分裂活动。社会上没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子摇旗呐喊，对革命委员会散布流言蜚语。
    面对着这种严重的阶级斗争的新形势，新动向，我们牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，狠狠批判了中国赫鲁晓夫“阶级斗争熄灭”的谬论，紧紧抓住阶级斗争这条纲，向阶级敌人发起进攻。我们深深懂得，千万不能放松对敌人的斗争，放松了对敌人的斗争，就有使革命政权重新丧失的危险。
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。我们一定牢记毛主席的伟大教导，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，保卫新生的革命委员会，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
