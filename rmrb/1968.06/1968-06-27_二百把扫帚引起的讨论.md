This year, the bamboo in the ninth production brigade of Xiaoliang Brigade, Chaoyang Commune, Mengjin County, Henan Province, had a bumper harvest. The commune members bundled many bamboo brooms, and in addition to using them within the brigade, they could also sell 200 brooms. Neighboring brigades and the supply and marketing cooperative heard this news and rushed to buy them. Some brigades, in urgent need, offered two yuan per broom. At this time, some commune members, considering the brigade's interests, suggested selling them quickly to get a higher price.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The basic task of political work is to constantly instill socialist ideology in the peasant masses and criticize capitalist tendencies." The brigade leadership believed: how to handle these 200 brooms is not a small matter; it is a question of which path to take. Therefore, they decided to discuss this issue with the commune members.

The discussion began. Some people said: we are producing and selling ourselves, which is not speculation, and selling for a higher price is better than selling for a lower price. Some people said: the price offered by the supply and marketing cooperative is not low either, and selling to them means no one can catch us doing anything wrong. Old poor peasant Zhao Hai Shui strongly disagreed with the above opinions. He said: Chairman Mao teaches us: "When we make plans, do things, and think about problems, we must start from the fact that our country has 600 million people, and we must never forget this." In 1962, our area suffered a severe disaster, and the Party and the government sent us grain from thousands of miles away to support us. Without Chairman Mao, how could we have today's good life? Today, we have a few brooms and want to sell them at a high price to make more money. This is not something we poor and lower-middle peasants should do. I firmly oppose this practice. The political instructor of the brigade, Communist Party member Liu Shouye, said: selling at a high price to make more money is the "profit-first" and "money-first" revisionist goods of the Chinese Khrushchev, which will lead us down the capitalist path. If we continue this way, we will go back to the old path, suffer twice, and we must now criticize the stinking goods of the Chinese Khrushchev and absolutely not take that path.

Everyone spoke passionately, and the discussion was very lively. Through this discussion, everyone's class struggle awareness and two-line struggle awareness were further heightened, their hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev was strengthened, and their confidence in taking the socialist path was firm.

Finally, everyone agreed to sell the brooms at the state-regulated price of nine jiao each, fully supporting the brother brigades.

    二百把扫帚引起的讨论
    今年，河南孟津县朝阳公社小良大队第九生产队的竹子获得了大丰收，社员们捆了很多竹扫帚，除了本队使用以外，还可以出卖二百把。邻近的大队和供销社知道这个消息以后，纷纷前来购买。有的队因为急需，一开口就主动出两元钱买一把。这时，有的社员从本队的利益出发，建议抓紧时间卖出去，可以得高价钱。
    毛主席教导说：“政治工作的基本任务是向农民群众不断地灌输社会主义思想，批评资本主义倾向。”生产队领导班子认为：如何处理这二百把扫帚，决不是件小事，是衡量走什么道路的问题。于是，决定把这个问题交给社员讨论。
    讨论开始了。有的人说：我们是自产自销，不属于投机倒把，多卖几个钱，总比少卖几个钱强。有的人说：供销社给我们出的价钱也不低，我们卖给供销社，谁也抓不住小辫子。老贫农赵海水很不同意上面的意见，他说：毛主席教导我们：“我们作计划、办事、想问题，都要从我国有六亿人口这一点出发，千万不要忘记这一点。”一九六二年我们这里遭了重灾，党和政府从几千里外给我们运来粮食，支援我们。要不是毛主席，那有今天这好日子？我们今天有了几把扫帚，就想卖高价，多得钱，这不是我们贫下中农应该做的事。我坚决反对这种做法。生产队政治队长、共产党员刘守业说：卖高价，多得钱，这是中国赫鲁晓夫“利润挂帅”“金钱第一”的修正主义黑货，它会把我们引上资本主义的邪路上去，这样下去，我们就会走回头路，吃二遍苦，我们现在就是要批判中国赫鲁晓夫的这些臭货色，决不能走那条路。
    大家你一言，我一语，讨论得十分热烈。通过这场讨论，进一步提高了大家的阶级斗争觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，增强了对中国赫鲁晓夫的仇恨，坚定了走社会主义道路的信心。
    最后，大家共同商定：按照往年国家规定的牌价，每把九角，全部支援了兄弟大队。
