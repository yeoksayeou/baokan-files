In today's Soviet Union, vast expanses of arable land have been eroded and degraded. This is a clear indication of the severe damage inflicted on the Soviet national economy by the revisionist clique, and it is the result of their full-scale restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union.

The superiority of the socialist system lies in breaking the shackles of private ownership, thereby greatly liberating the productive forces of society, including the elimination of waste and destruction of productive resources caused by the capitalist mode of production. Only in a socialist society can natural resources be rationally and plannedly utilized according to the needs of the working people. During the period when Stalin was in charge, not only was agricultural collectivization achieved in the Soviet Union, but large-scale afforestation measures were also implemented to protect the soil and crops, enabling Soviet socialist agriculture to achieve tremendous success. However, after the revisionist clique seized power, they replaced socialist production with capitalist production, promoting kulak economics in the countryside, and turning Soviet agriculture into a mess. Moreover, they ruthlessly destroyed Stalin's plans to transform nature and the labor achievements of the Soviet people!

Engels once said, "The individual capitalist, who controls production and exchange, can only consider the most immediate beneficial effects of his activities." The bourgeoisie, in pursuit of immediate gains, plunders natural resources without regard for the consequences. This is an inevitable phenomenon of the capitalist mode of production.

In today's Soviet Union, the bourgeois privileged stratum controlling the national economy is doing the same thing. They only know how to plunder more wealth from the Soviet land to satisfy their extravagant and debauched lifestyles. How can they consider the interests of the people or the long-term consequences? The revisionist clique is a bunch of spendthrifts who know only how to squander and not how to manage!

Under Stalin's leadership, the Soviet Union turned deserts into fertile fields, while the revisionist clique turns fertile land into wasteland. This stark contrast cannot but make the broad masses of the Soviet people increasingly miss Stalin and socialist Soviet Union, and feel an increasingly strong hatred towards the revisionist clique, and launch an increasingly fierce resistance against the restoration of capitalism.

    败家子
    在今天的苏联，大量的耕地遭到侵蚀和变劣。这是苏修叛徒集团严重破坏苏联国民经济的罪证，是他们在苏联全面复辟资本主义的恶果。
    社会主义制度的优越性，在于打破私有制的桎梏，大大地解放社会的生产力，包括消除由于资本主义生产方式而造成的生产资料的浪费和破坏。只有在社会主义社会，才能够根据劳动人民的需要合理地和有计划地利用天然财富。在斯大林领导时期，不仅在苏联实现了农业集体化，而且为保护土壤和庄稼而实行了大规模护田造林的措施，使苏联的社会主义农业获得了巨大的成就。但是，苏修叛徒集团篡夺政权以后，用资本主义生产代替了社会主义生产，在农村中大搞富农经济，把苏联的农业搞得一团糟。不仅如此，他们还把斯大林改造自然的计划，把苏联人民过去的劳动成果，也粗暴地破坏了！
    恩格斯说过：“个别的统治着生产和交换的资本家，只能关心到他们活动的最直接的有益效果。”资产阶级为了追求眼前利益而掠夺自然资源，总是不顾后果的。这是资本主义生产方式的不可避免的现象。
    在今日的苏联，控制着国计民生的资产阶级特权阶层，同样是这样干的。他们只知道从苏联的土地上掠夺更多的财富，以满足其骄奢淫逸的生活的需要。他们哪里会考虑到人民的利益，考虑到长远的后果呢？苏修叛徒集团完全是一伙只知挥霍，不顾营生的败家子！
    斯大林领导的苏联把沙漠变作良田，苏修叛徒集团则使沃土成为荒地。这个鲜明的对照，不能不使广大的苏联人民更加怀念斯大林，怀念社会主义的苏联，而对苏修叛徒感到越来越强烈的痛恨，对资本主义复辟展开越来越猛烈的反抗。
