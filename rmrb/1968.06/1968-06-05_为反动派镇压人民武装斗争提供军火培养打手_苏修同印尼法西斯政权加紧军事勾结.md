The Soviet revisionist clique is intensifying its military collusion with the Indonesian fascist military regime, providing arms to the Indonesian reactionaries to suppress the people's armed struggle and training henchmen.

According to a report by the New China News Agency on the 2nd, Jakarta: The Soviet revisionist clique is intensifying its collusion with the Indonesian fascist military regime, providing arms to the Indonesian reactionaries to suppress the people's armed struggle and training henchmen.

According to a report by the official Indonesian news agency Antara, Indonesian fascist military regime Foreign Minister Malik revealed in mid-May in the parliament that the Soviet revisionist clique expressed its willingness to "sell the parts needed by the Indonesian armed forces." The Soviet revisionist clique is also willing to "bear the expenses of the Indonesian armed forces trainees who are currently in the Soviet Union." According to the *Fajar Rakyat Miskin* (Poor People's Torch) newspaper, high-ranking Soviet military officers such as Pakhomyenko secretly went to the East Java region of Indonesia, where the people's armed struggle has arisen, in January this year to engage in conspiratorial activities. They discussed with the local Indonesian Air Force leaders the possibility of Soviet aid in providing aircraft parts to Indonesia.

According to a report by the Associated Press, the Soviet revisionist clique recently reached an agreement with the Indonesian fascist military regime to once again agree to extend the repayment period for "most of the debts and loans used to purchase heavy weapons" by the Suharto-Nasution right-wing military clique. Currently, the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime is using the weapons provided by its masters, the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists, to brutally suppress the Indonesian people's revolutionary armed struggle.

    据新华社二日讯　雅加达消息：苏修叛徒集团加紧同印尼法西斯军人政权进行军事勾结，为印尼反动派镇压人民武装斗争提供军火，培养打手。
    据印尼官方喉舌安塔拉通讯社报道，印尼法西斯军人政权外交部长马利克五月中在国会透露，苏修叛徒集团表示愿意“向印尼出售印尼武装部队所需要的零件”。苏修叛徒集团还愿意“负担目前还在苏联的印尼武装部队受训人员的经费”。另据《贫民火炬报》透露，苏修叛徒集团的高级军官帕霍缅科等，今年一月悄悄跑到印尼人民武装斗争已经兴起的东爪哇地区进行阴谋活动，同那里的印尼空军头目“讨论了苏联向印尼提供飞机零件的援助的可能性”。
    据美联社透露，苏修叛徒集团最近还同印尼法西斯军人政权达成协议，再次同意苏哈托—纳苏蒂安右派军人集团延期偿还“大部分是购买重型武器的债款和贷款”。目前，苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权正在使用它的主子美帝和苏修提供的武器，疯狂镇压印尼人民的革命武装斗争。
