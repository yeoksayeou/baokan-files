Chairman Mao's latest directive is a powerful ideological weapon to defeat domestic and foreign enemies. Unite all revolutionary forces to steadily, accurately, and resolutely strike down a handful of class enemies.

The entire nation's military and civilians are earnestly studying Chairman Mao's latest directive. Chairman Mao's latest directive thoroughly exposes the counter-revolutionary essence common to all forms of bourgeois dictatorship in the world, thoroughly exposes the counter-revolutionary essence of the bourgeois reactionary line of China's Khrushchev, and points out to us the great historical significance of the Cultural Revolution in consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. They are determined to forever remain loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, to carry the revolutionary criticism to the end, to further consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, to consolidate and develop the revolutionary committees, to strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end.

New China News Agency, June 4th: At this crucial moment of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, our great teacher and great leader Chairman Mao has issued a new directive: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." In recent days, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat nationwide, hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses, and the broad ranks of the People's Liberation Army have held discussion meetings, symposiums, and experience-sharing meetings, studying Chairman Mao's latest directive time and again. People from all over the country say that Chairman Mao's latest directive thoroughly exposes the counter-revolutionary essence common to all forms of bourgeois dictatorship in the world, thoroughly exposes the counter-revolutionary essence of the bourgeois reactionary line of China's Khrushchev, and points out to us the great historical significance of the Cultural Revolution in consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. Chairman Mao trusts the masses the most, relies on the masses the most, and respects the masses' pioneering spirit the most, forever being heart-to-heart with us. Chairman Mao's latest directive is the greatest concern, greatest encouragement, greatest support, and greatest education for the revolutionary masses of the proletariat nationwide, the broad revolutionary masses, and the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army. It is a powerful ideological weapon to defeat all class enemies at home and abroad, and a guiding light to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution. We must resolutely respond to the great call of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, take Comrade Deng as an example, earnestly implement Chairman Mao's latest directive, adhere to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and carry the Cultural Revolution to the end!

Implement Chairman Mao's latest directive, adhere to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and carry the revolutionary criticism to the end.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "One of our important tasks on the ideological front now is to carry out a criticism of revisionism." After studying Chairman Mao's latest directive, the people from all over the country have a deeper understanding of the great significance of carrying out a sustained and in-depth revolutionary criticism. They expressed their determination to fully mobilize and rely on the broad masses of the people, to thoroughly criticize and expose the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev and his agents, to firmly establish Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and to ensure that our proletarian iron mountain will never change color. Revolutionary workers from Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Chengdu, Hefei, Nanchang, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, Xining, Lanzhou, and other places repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest directive and said that Chairman Mao's latest directive most profoundly and thoroughly points out the fundamental difference between the proletarian revolutionary line and the bourgeois reactionary line. Chairman Mao is heart-to-heart with us revolutionary workers. In every revolutionary critical period and on every critical issue, it is Chairman Mao who supports us and points out the direction for us to move forward. China's Khrushchev and other top capitalist roaders within the party, along with their agents, represent the interests of the Kuomintang reactionaries, imperialism, revisionism, the bourgeoisie, and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. They spare no effort to brutally suppress the revolutionary masses. We revolutionary workers will not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations. We must be like Comrade Deng, unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, carry out a sustained and in-depth revolutionary criticism, and launch an unrelenting and fierce attack on the class enemies. The revolutionary cadres and masses of Taoyuan Brigade in Funing County, Hebei, said that our Taoyuan Brigade is a black experimental field for China's Khrushchev to restore capitalism. The "Taoyuan Experience" he and his wife personally concocted is a genuine counter-revolutionary black commodity of suppressing the masses and implementing bourgeois dictatorship on revolutionary cadres and masses. We deeply feel from the life-and-death class struggle that Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is our lifeline. We must follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, carry out a sustained and in-depth revolutionary criticism, and thoroughly eliminate the counter-revolutionary revisionist poison spread by China's Khrushchev. The young militia members of Sanli Village, Sanli Commune, Guangzhou suburbs, said in a symposium that the Kuomintang reactionaries, the bourgeoisie, and all exploiting classes have always brutally suppressed the broad masses of the people. China's Khrushchev and other top capitalist roaders within the party frantically push the bourgeois reactionary line, aiming to suppress the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad masses of the people, implement bourgeois dictatorship, and restore capitalism. We must defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to the death, thoroughly criticize China's Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line, continuously raise our class struggle and line struggle consciousness, and carry the Cultural Revolution to the end.

Implement Chairman Mao's latest directive, adhere to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and steadily, accurately, and resolutely strike down a handful of class enemies.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our army has always had two policies: first, be ruthless towards the enemy, crush it, and annihilate it; second, be united with our own people, the people, comrades, superiors, and subordinates." The hundreds of millions of military and civilians nationwide, while studying and implementing Chairman Mao's latest directive, expressed their determination to unswervingly carry out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, to mobilize the masses, to correctly distinguish between two types of contradictions, to steadily, accurately, and resolutely strike down a handful of class enemies, to resolutely smash the rightist reversal wind, and to further strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. The revolutionary masses of the Second Pharmaceutical Factory in Shanghai, while studying Chairman Mao's latest directive, compared the old society under Kuomintang rule with the new society under Communist Party leadership, and compared China's Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line with Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Through a great indictment, exposure, and criticism of the counter-revolutionary crimes of the Kuomintang reactionaries and China's Khrushchev in suppressing revolutionary masses and implementing bourgeois dictatorship, they further raised their class struggle and line struggle consciousness and understood the profound significance of Chairman Mao's latest directive in consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. They are determined to implement Chairman Mao's latest directive and to strike down a handful of class enemies more steadily, accurately, and resolutely. The revolutionary workers of the Huabei Pharmaceutical Factory in Shijiazhuang expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, to mobilize the masses, and to expose the traitors, spies, and other counter-revolutionaries hiding in the dark corners and making trouble. The broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres of the Nanjing Radio Factory said that the counter-revolutionary essence of the bourgeois reactionary line is to suppress the masses, while the core of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is to believe in and rely on the masses and to protect the masses. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, strictly distinguish between two types of contradictions, unite all revolutionary forces that can be united, steadily, accurately, and resolutely strike down a handful of class enemies, and implement the dictatorship of the proletariat on this handful of class enemies.

Implement Chairman Mao's latest directive, adhere to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and further consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Organizing tens of millions of people and mobilizing a surging revolutionary army is the need of today's revolution to attack the counter-revolution." After studying Chairman Mao's latest directive, the broad revolutionary masses from all over the country unanimously expressed their determination to constantly enhance the solid unity of the proletarian revolutionary ranks on the principle of Mao Zedong Thought, to consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination by system, industry, and class, to be vigilant against rightist splitism, and to thoroughly smash all the tricks and plots of the class enemies attempting to split the proletarian revolutionary ranks. The revolutionary youngsters and revolutionary teachers and students of the universities and colleges in Guangzhou said that the great proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao is an unprecedented and magnificent revolutionary mass movement. Only by fully unleashing the revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity of the masses can we achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, be good at uniting our own class ranks, be good at uniting revolutionary allies, be good at uniting the majority of cadres and masses, and constantly develop and consolidate the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, forming an even more surging revolutionary army, and launching a more powerful attack on the class enemies to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end. The revolutionary masses of the Xi'an Conservatory of Music, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist personnel, recently focused on class struggle, carried out an in-depth revolutionary criticism, and exposed a handful of class enemies hiding in the revolutionary ranks. The broad revolutionary teachers and students of this school, on the principle of Mao Zedong Thought, have united more closely. The revolutionary masses of this school expressed their determination to deeply understand and fully implement Chairman Mao's latest directive, to firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and to further consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. The standing committee members of the Heilongjiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee pointed out in a study session that relying on whom, uniting with whom, and striking down whom is the primary issue of the Cultural Revolution. We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings and, in all work, firmly rely on the proletarian revolutionaries, unite all revolutionary forces that can be united, consolidate and develop the great victories already achieved in the Cultural Revolution, and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Implement Chairman Mao's latest directive, adhere to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, consolidate and develop the revolutionary committees, and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without extensive people's democracy, the dictatorship of the proletariat cannot be consolidated, and the power will be unstable. Without democracy, without mobilizing the masses, and without the supervision of the masses, it is impossible to effectively suppress the reactionaries and bad elements, nor is it possible to effectively reform them. They will continue to make trouble and have the possibility of a comeback." After studying Chairman Mao's latest directive, the members of the revolutionary committees at various levels in the provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions decided to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, to mobilize the masses, to firmly rely on the masses, to fully unleash the power of the dictatorship of the proletariat with the participation of the broad masses of the people, to implement the dictatorship of the proletariat on the bourgeoisie and all reactionaries, to build the revolutionary committees at various levels into a strong fortress that firmly protects the broad masses of the people and firmly suppresses the class enemies, and to further strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. They said that Chairman Mao's latest directive has once again pointed out the direction and tasks for the construction of the revolutionary committees and for the revolutionary committees to hold power well and use power well. The revolutionary cadres of Dazhai Brigade said that whether there are people in one's eyes, whether one thinks of the people, and whether one relies on the people in one's work is the fundamental dividing line between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and China's Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line. We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings, always think of the people, always rely on the people, completely and thoroughly serve the people, forever unite with the people, fight with the people, resolutely suppress a handful of class enemies, and carry the Cultural Revolution to the end. Many revolutionary cadres, military representatives, and revolutionary masses who participate in the revolutionary committees from various places pointed out after studying Chairman Mao's latest directive that in the Cultural Revolution, the focus of the struggle between the two lines has always been the issue of how to treat the masses. Whether one can correctly treat the broad masses of the people is a matter of stance, a matter of worldview, and a major issue of whether one stands on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line or on the side of the bourgeois reactionary line. They expressed their determination to resolutely follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, take Comrade Deng as an example, resolutely execute and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, forever believe in and rely on the broad masses of the people, fully mobilize the masses to participate in the dictatorship of the people under the leadership of the proletarian party, more effectively and resolutely suppress a handful of class enemies, build the revolutionary committees at various levels into a battle command center that leads the broad revolutionary masses to launch a fierce attack on the class enemies, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

    落实毛主席的最新指示，坚持毛主席的革命路线，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人
    毛主席教导我们：“我们的军队一向就有两条方针：第一对敌人要狠，要压倒它，要消灭它；第二对自己人、对人民、对同志、对官长、对部下要和，要团结。”全国亿万军民在学习和落实毛主席最新指示的时候纷纷表示，一定要坚定不移地贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线，放手发动群众，正确区分两类不同性质的矛盾，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，坚决粉碎右倾翻案妖风，进一步加强无产阶级专政。上海第二制药厂的无产阶级革命派在学习毛主席最新指示的时候，把国民党统治下的旧社会同共产党领导下的新社会进行对比，把中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线同毛主席的无产阶级革命路线进行对比，通过对国民党反动派以及中国赫鲁晓夫镇压革命群众，实行资产阶级专政的反革命罪行的大控诉、大揭发、大批判，进一步提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，领会了毛主席最新指示对于巩固无产阶级专政的深远意义。他们决心落实毛主席的最新指示，更加稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人。石家庄华北制药厂的革命工人们表示，一定要按照毛主席的教导，放手发动群众，决心把隐藏在阴暗角落里兴风作浪的叛徒、特务和其他反革命分子一个个地挖出来。南京无线电厂的广大革命群众和革命干部说，资产阶级反动路线的反革命本质是镇压群众，毛主席无产阶级革命路线的核心是相信和依靠群众，保护群众。我们一定要遵循毛主席的教导，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，团结一切可以团结的革命力量，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，对这一小撮阶级敌人实行无产阶级专政。
    落实毛主席的最新指示，坚持毛主席的革命路线，进一步巩固和发展革命大联合、革命三结合

    落实毛主席的最新指示，坚持毛主席的革命路线，巩固和发展革命委员会，强化无产阶级专政
    毛主席教导我们：“没有广泛的人民民主，无产阶级专政不能巩固，政权会不稳。没有民主，没有把群众发动起来，没有群众的监督，就不可能对反动分子和坏分子实行有效的专政，也不可能对他们进行有效的改造，他们就会继续捣乱，还有复辟的可能。”各省、市、自治区各级革命委员会的成员，认真学习了毛主席的最新指示以后，决心遵照毛主席的教导，放手发动群众，坚决依靠群众，充分发挥有广大人民群众参加的无产阶级专政的威力，对资产阶级和一切反动分子实行无产阶级专政，把各级革命委员会建设成为坚决保护广大人民群众和坚决镇压阶级敌人的坚强堡垒，进一步强化无产阶级专政。他们说，毛主席的最新指示，为革命委员会的建设，为革命委员会掌好权用好权，又一次指明了方向和任务。大寨大队的革命干部说，眼里有没有群众，心里想不想群众，工作靠不靠群众，这是毛主席无产阶级革命路线和中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线的根本分界线。我们一定要牢记毛主席的教导，时时刻刻想群众，处处事事靠群众，完全彻底为群众，永远和群众团结在一起，战斗在一起，坚决镇压一小撮阶级敌人，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。许多地方参加革命委员会的革命干部代表、军队代表和革命群众代表，学习了毛主席的最新指示以后指出，在无产阶级文化大革命中，两条路线斗争的焦点始终是如何对待群众的问题。能不能正确对待广大人民群众，是立场问题，是世界观问题，是站在毛主席革命路线一边还是站在资产阶级反动路线一边的大是大非问题。他们表示，一定要坚决遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，以门合同志为榜样，坚决执行、誓死保卫毛主席的革命路线，永远相信和依靠广大人民群众，充分发动群众参加无产阶级政党领导下的人民群众的专政，更有效地坚决镇压一小撮阶级敌人，把各级革命委员会建设成为带领广大革命群众向阶级敌人猛烈进攻的战斗指挥部，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
