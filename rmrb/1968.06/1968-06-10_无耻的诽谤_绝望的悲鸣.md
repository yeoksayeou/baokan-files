In 1905, when Lenin was denouncing the constitutional democrats within the Social Democratic Party, he said, "Blowing one's own horn and lying is moral decay, which inevitably leads to political decay." Today, the Soviet revisionist clique is far more corrupt and degenerate than the old opportunists of yesteryear. Therefore, boasting, lying, spreading rumors, and slandering have become the stock-in-trade of these political gamblers.

From the very first day of the great victory of the Cultural Revolution in our country, the Soviet revisionist clique, driven by their reactionary class instincts, have been operating all their propaganda machines, using the most vicious language to curse and attack. The heads of the Soviet revisionist clique, Brezhnev, Kosygin, and the like, have all personally taken to the stage, barking hysterically. But what are the wails of a few autumn insects? The surging torrent of the Cultural Revolution in China is sweeping away all obstacles, surging forward with great momentum. The Soviet revisionist clique feels even more desperate.

Thus, a Soviet revisionist clown named Zhelokhovtsev, who had previously studied in Beijing Normal University for over half a year, was elevated to the stage of the Moscow magazine *Novy Mir*. Recently, this clown, posing as a "witness" to the Cultural Revolution, has been publishing articles in droves, viciously attacking and slandering the Cultural Revolution in our country.

In his long and stinking anti-China article titled "The 'Cultural Revolution' as Seen from Close Up," Zhelokhovtsev displays his hooligan skills of turning black into white and fabricating lies, sparing no effort to spread rumors and slander. At the beginning of the article, he writes: "In my dormitory, there is a square hole in the wall, and a bookshelf is embedded in it." He then solemnly adds: "In the next room, it is obvious that they can hear every word I say," and "General surveillance and mutual denunciation have become the norm in today's China." Who can believe such nonsense? An ordinary wardrobe in the dormitory for foreign students has become "evidence" for him to attack our social system. This reveals nothing but the clown's despicable and cowardly nature.

Zhelokhovtsev, wearing the colored glasses of the declining class, shamelessly distorts the glorious history of the Cultural Revolution at Beijing Normal University in this reactionary article and madly attacks the revolutionary young fighters of the university.

In June of the previous year, a storm arose, and waves surged. Under the inspiring battle call of our great leader Chairman Mao, the Red Guards and the broad revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing Normal University, with the great revolutionary spirit of "It is reasonable to rebel against the reactionaries," fearlessly confronted the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the university, firing thousands of revolutionary big-character posters like a barrage of artillery at the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party in the university. The revolutionary spirit of the broad revolutionary masses was so inspiring! However, what we struck at the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party in the university, hurt the hearts of Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their little henchmen. Zhelokhovtsev was restless, trembling with fear, hiding in the dark corners, viciously cursing the revolutionary actions of the revolutionary young fighters of the university as "madness," "ferocity," and "ingratitude and inhumanity." This is truly a case of "the rabbit dies and the fox mourns, the objects share the same fate!"

Poor clown Zhelokhovtsev, put away your hypocritical "humanity" nonsense! Let me ask: Isn't it precisely this handful of new labor aristocrats in the Soviet revisionist clique, who talk so much about "humanity," sucking the blood and sweat of the broad working people of the Soviet Union like vampires? Isn't it precisely this handful of shameful traitors in the Soviet revisionist clique, who talk so much about "humanity," brutally suppressing the Soviet revolutionary people who rise up to resist the revisionist rule? Your so-called "humanity" is thoroughly bourgeois dictatorship; your "madness" and "savagery" are precisely the great revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes.

Our great teacher Chairman Mao has pointed out wisely: "The old Social Democrats of several decades and the modern revisionists of more than a decade are a group of anti-communist, anti-people counter-revolutionaries. Their struggle with us is a life-and-death struggle, and there is no question of equality. Therefore, our struggle against them can only be a life-and-death struggle. Our relationship with them is absolutely not one of equality but one of a class oppressing another class, that is, the dictatorship or rule of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie." Let Zhelokhovtsev and his ilk bark all they want. The broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary people of China are closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, striking the handful of class enemies steadily, accurately, and fiercely, and resolutely carrying the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end!

This Soviet revisionist little running dog, Zhelokhovtsev, who pretended to be "not interested in politics and only engaged in scholarship" during his eight months of "study" at Beijing Normal University, neglected his studies but spent a lot of time and energy on evil counter-revolutionary activities. He often went out of the school to engage in activities, sometimes until deep into the night before sneaking back to the school. He usually flitted about like a fly, trying to find the so-called "dark side" of our socialist system, and even openly colluded with bad people in society to spy on our country's intelligence and create anti-China rumors. What the Soviet revisionist clique sent this guy to our country to do is obviously clear.

This little running dog, Zhelokhovtsev, following the leaders of the Soviet revisionist clique, barks like a mad dog, shamelessly attacking and slandering the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in our country, which precisely proves that our Cultural Revolution has established a brilliant and great historical merit.

"The day the people rejoice is the day the counter-revolutionaries suffer." Two years ago, when the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in our country was flourishing, Zhelokhovtsev wailed as if he were facing a great disaster: "What could be more heartbreaking than this?" Today, the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in our country has achieved decisive victory, and the situation is excellent and getting better and better. The proletarian dictatorship in our country has never been as solid as it is today, and our socialist motherland has never been as strong and prosperous as it is today. Let Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their ilk, in the face of the great victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in China, go and cry with the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in our country who have been overthrown!

    无耻的诽谤　绝望的悲鸣
    北京师范大学革命委员会
    一九○五年，列宁在痛斥社会民主党内的立宪民主派的时候，曾经说：“吹牛撒谎是道义上的灭亡，它势必引向政治上的灭亡。”今天的苏修叛徒集团比起当年的老机会主义者来，不知更腐朽堕落多少倍，因此，吹牛、撒谎、造谣、诽谤，就成了这帮政治赌棍的拿手好戏。
    从我国无产阶级文化大革命胜利开展的第一天起，苏修叛徒集团出于反动的阶级本能，就开动他们所有的宣传机器，用尽最恶毒的语言进行谩骂和攻击。苏修叛徒集团的头子勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流也一个个亲自出马，歇斯底里地狂吠。但是，几只秋虫的悲鸣又算得了什么呢？中国无产阶级文化大革命的滚滚洪流，正在冲决一切障碍，汹涌澎湃，奔腾向前。苏修叛徒集团更加感到日暮途穷了。
    于是，一个打着曾经在北京师范大学“学习”的招牌、到中国混过半年多的苏修小丑热洛霍夫采夫，被当作宝贝捧上了莫斯科《新世界》杂志的讲台。最近，这个小丑俨然以文化革命“目击者”的身份，连篇累牍地发表文章，恶毒攻击和诽谤我国的无产阶级文化大革命。
    热洛霍夫采夫在题为《从近处观察的“文化革命”》的又臭又长的反华文章里，施展出颠倒黑白、无中生有的流氓本领，挖空心思，造谣中伤。文章一开头，他就写道：我的宿舍的墙上，“凿了一个正方形的洞，洞里嵌着一个书架”；紧接着煞有介事地说：“隔壁的房子里”“显然可以听到我讲的每一句话”，“普遍盯梢和互相告密在现今的中国已成了常规”。到底有谁能相信他的这种胡言乱语呢？“留学生”宿舍中一个极普通的壁橱，也成了他攻击我国社会制度的“材料”。这除了表明这个小丑的卑鄙下流和做贼心虚之外，还能说明什么呢？
    热洛霍夫采夫戴着没落阶级的有色眼镜，在这篇反动文章里肆无忌惮地歪曲北京师范大学文化大革命的光辉历史，丧心病狂地攻击师大革命小将。
    前年六月，狂飙骤起，怒涛澎湃，在伟大统帅毛主席的战斗号召的鼓舞下，我们北京师范大学的红卫兵小将和广大革命师生，以“对反动派造反有理”的大无畏英雄气概，天不怕，地不怕，向中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在师大的代理人猛烈开火，千万张革命大字报象排炮一样射向师大党内一小撮走资派。广大无产阶级革命派的革命造反精神是多么令人欢欣鼓舞啊！可是，我们打在党内一小撮走资派身上，却痛在勃列日涅夫、柯西金及其小爪牙的心上。热洛霍夫采夫坐立不安，心惊肉跳，躲在阴暗的角落里，恶狠狠地咒骂师大革命小将的革命造反行动是什么“疯狂”、“凶残”、“不知感恩和人道”。这真是兔死狐悲，物伤其类！
    可怜的小丑热洛霍夫采夫，还是收起你这套虚伪的“人道”的谰言吧！试问：难道不正是苏修集团这一小撮大谈“人道”的新工贼，象吸血鬼一样拚命榨取苏联广大劳动人民的血汗吗？不正是苏修集团这一小撮大讲“人道”的可耻叛徒，对于起来反抗修正主义统治的苏联革命人民进行残酷的镇压吗？你们所谓的“人道”，就是彻头彻尾的资产阶级专政；你们眼中的“疯狂”和“野蛮”，正是无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的伟大的革命。
    我们伟大的导师毛主席英明地指出：“几十年以来的老的社会民主党和十几年以来的现代修正主义”，“是一群反共、反人民的反革命分子，他们同我们的斗争是你死我活的斗争，丝毫谈不到什么平等。因此，我们对他们的斗争也只能是一场你死我活的斗争，我们对他们的关系绝对不是什么平等的关系，而是一个阶级压迫另一个阶级的关系，即无产阶级对资产阶级实行独裁或专政的关系”。让热洛霍夫采夫之流去叫骂吧，中国的广大无产阶级革命派和革命人民正在紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，坚定不移地把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    热洛霍夫采夫这个假装“不关心政治，专门搞学问”的苏修小走卒，在北京师范大学“学习”的八个月中，对功课敷衍了事，而用大量的时间和精力去干罪恶的反革命勾当。他经常跑到校外四处活动，有时活动到深夜才偷偷地溜回学校。他平时象苍蝇似地东窜西窜，企图搜寻我国社会主义制度的所谓“阴暗面”，甚至公然勾结社会上的坏人刺探我国情报，制造反华谣言。苏修叛徒集团把这个家伙派到我国来究竟干什么，事实难道不是昭然若揭的吗？
    热洛霍夫采夫这个小走卒，跟在苏修叛徒集团头目后头，象恶狗一样狂吠，放肆地攻击和诽谤我国的无产阶级文化大革命，正好证明我们的文化大革命立下了光辉灿烂的伟大历史功勋。
    “人民大众开心之日，就是反革命分子难受之时。”两年前，当我国的无产阶级文化大革命蓬勃兴起的时候，热洛霍夫采夫就象大难临头似地哀号：“还能有什么比这更痛心的呢？”今天，我国的无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了决定性的胜利，形势一片大好，越来越好。我国的无产阶级专政从来没有象今天这样巩固，我们的社会主义祖国从来没有象今天这样强大和昌盛。让勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流，在中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利面前，同我国被打倒的一小撮反革命修正主义分子一起去伤心，去哭泣，去发抖吧！
