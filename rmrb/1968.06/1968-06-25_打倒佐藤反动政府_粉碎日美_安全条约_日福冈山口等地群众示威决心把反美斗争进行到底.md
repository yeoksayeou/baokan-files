The masses in Fukuoka, Yamaguchi, and Saitama in Japan held rallies and demonstrations on June 23 to oppose the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty' and demand the withdrawal of U.S. military bases from Japan.

On that day, about 1,500 workers and citizens in the Keishu area of Fukuoka Prefecture held a rally to oppose the Sato reactionary government's collusion with U.S. imperialism in an attempt to move the U.S. Air Force base from Itazu to the Jiecheng base used by the Japanese Air Self-Defense Force.

Representatives from the Fukuoka Prefecture branch of the Japan Socialist Party, the Fukuoka Prefecture Federation of Trade Unions, and the Fukuoka Prefecture branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) spoke at the rally, unanimously stating: "We will continue this struggle until we drive U.S. imperialism out of every corner of Japan. We will not give U.S. imperialism an inch of land."

After the rally, the participants held a demonstration march towards the Jiecheng base. Their banners read: "Smash the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty,'" "Yankees, get out of Japan," and "Withdraw from the Itazu base."

Upon reaching the Jiecheng base, the demonstrators, despite police threats, held a rally at the base's gate. A demonstrator named Kashiwagi Katsuyoshi read Chairman Mao's teachings: "All the peoples of the world, unite! Oppose the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! All the peoples of the world should have the courage to oppose aggression, to fight against it, to be not afraid of difficulties and to advance wave upon wave. Then, the whole world will belong to the people. All the monsters of the world will be destroyed." His reading was met with enthusiastic applause.

Four hundred patriotic young workers and students in Yamaguchi Prefecture held a rally in the Labor Hall of Iwakuni City in the afternoon to demand the withdrawal of the U.S. Navy base in Iwakuni.

After the rally, they held a demonstration march.

The march, led by a banner reading "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought," proceeded through the main streets of Iwakuni City towards the U.S. military base. Along the way, they chanted slogans: "Withdraw from the Iwakuni base," "Abolish the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty,'" and "Overthrow the Sato reactionary government."

The Sato reactionary government hastily dispatched 500 armed police to protect the Iwakuni base and unjustly arrested five young people.

On the same afternoon, a large number of young workers, students, and citizens in Saitama Prefecture held a rally at the square in front of Asaka Station to demand the withdrawal of the Asaka base. Representatives speaking at the rally expressed their determination not to allow U.S. imperialism to use the Asaka base for the Vietnam War and to resolutely fight to the end to smash the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty.' The representatives also exposed the crimes of the Japan Communist Party's revisionist group led by Moshin, denouncing their treacherous activities.

After the rally, the participants sang "The Internationale" and held a demonstration march around the base. Their just actions were supported and welcomed by the residents of Asaka City.

    “打倒佐藤反动政府”“粉碎日美‘安全条约’”
    日福冈山口等地群众示威决心把反美斗争进行到底
    新华社二十四日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本福冈、山口和埼玉等县的爱国人民，二十三日分别举行集会和示威游行，反对日美“安全条约”，要求撤除美国在日本的军事基地。
    这一天，福冈县京筑地区约一千五百名工人和市民举行大会，反对佐藤反动政府勾结美帝国主义，阴谋把美国空军设在板付的基地，迁移到日本航空“自卫队”使用的筑城基地。
    日本社会党福冈县总部、福冈县工会和日中友好协会（正统）福冈县总部的代表在会上讲话时一致指出：“我们要把这一斗争进行下去，直到从全日本的各个角落里把美帝国主义赶出去。我们决不给美帝一寸土地。”
    会后，参加大会的群众举行示威游行，向筑城基地进发。他们高举的标语牌上写着：“粉碎日美‘安全条约’”“美国佬滚出日本”“撤除板付基地”等口号。
    游行队伍到达筑城基地以后，示威群众不顾警察的威胁，在这个基地的大门前举行集会。一位名叫柏木椷一的示威者在会上朗读毛主席的教导：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”他的朗读受到大家极为热烈的欢迎。
    山口县爱国青年工人和学生四百人，二十三日下午在岩国市的劳动会馆举行大会，要求撤除美国海军的岩国基地。
    会后，人们举行了示威游行。
    游行队伍以写着“毛泽东思想万岁”的横幅为前导，通过岩国市的主要街道，向美军基地前进。他们在沿途高呼口号：“撤除岩国基地”、“废除日美‘安全条约’”、“打倒佐藤反动政府”。
    佐藤反动政府慌忙出动五百名武装警察保护岩国基地，并无理逮捕五名青年。
    同一天下午，埼玉县大批青年工人、学生和市民在朝霞火车站前广场上举行集会，要求撤除朝霞基地。在会上发言的代表表示，决心不准美帝国主义利用朝霞基地为侵越战争服务，并且要为粉碎日美“安全条约”而坚决斗争到底。代表们还揭露日共宫本修正主义集团破坏日本人民反美斗争的罪恶行径，痛斥了他们的叛卖活动。
    会后，与会群众高唱《国际歌》，在基地周围举行示威游行。他们的正义行动得到朝霞市居民的赞助和欢迎。
