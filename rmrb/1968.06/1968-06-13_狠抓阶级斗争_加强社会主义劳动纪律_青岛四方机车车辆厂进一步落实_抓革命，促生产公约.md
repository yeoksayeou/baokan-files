The broad masses of workers at Qingdao Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Works have overcome the influence of anarchist tendencies, promoting continuous development in production. The entire factory completed 104.9% of the plan in April and increased production by 13% in May compared to April.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, June 12: After the various workshops and teams at Qingdao Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Works universally formulated the "Grasp the Revolution, Promote Production" agreement, they continued to firmly grasp class struggle, carry out thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, and further implement the "Grasp the Revolution, Promote Production" agreement. From several months of practicing the "Grasp the Revolution, Promote Production" agreement, they have come to realize that socialist labor discipline can only be established and consolidated through firmly grasping class struggle, carrying out thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, and the struggle to break private interests and establish public interests.

In February this year, the various workshops at Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Works universally formulated the "Grasp the Revolution, Promote Production" agreement, effectively resisting the influence of anarchist tendencies. However, after formulating the agreement, it was not all smooth sailing. A handful of class enemies, unwilling to accept their defeat, continued to spread poison and stir up trouble, sabotaging the implementation of the agreement. Phenomena of not observing socialist labor discipline once again emerged in the workshops. The revolutionary workers of the diesel engine workshop's processing team No. 7, after thorough discussion, with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, wrote a big-character poster exposing the class enemies' continued spread of anarchist tendencies. This poster emphasized that one should not think that once the agreement is formulated, anarchism will disappear and socialist labor discipline can be established without struggle. The agreement has been produced, but the struggle against anarchism has not ended. Formulating the agreement is a serious class struggle, and implementing the agreement is an even more serious class struggle. We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, grasp class struggle, carry out thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, and thoroughly criticize and expose anarchism in thought and politics, eliminating the roots of anarchism. Once this big-character poster was put up, it immediately caused a sensation in the entire workshop of more than twenty teams, which followed suit by putting up big-character posters expressing their enthusiastic support and approval, and launched a high tide of revolutionary criticism, exposing a handful of bad elements who created divisions and spread anarchism. The factory revolutionary committee promptly promoted their experience throughout the factory, raising the struggle against anarchism in the entire factory to the height of a struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads, launching an even greater high tide of revolutionary criticism.

To effectively lead this struggle, the factory revolutionary committee organized a study class for workshop and team leaders to participate in, focusing on criticizing anarchism. In the study class, they studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "The army advances, production increases by an inch, strengthen discipline, and the revolution will be invincible" and "It is necessary to resolutely overcome the state of indiscipline or anarchism that exists in many places," severely criticizing the reactionary fallacies of anarchism spread by China's Khrushchev, extensively exposing the crimes of the walking capitalists, traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries in the factory who incited anarchism, and extensively discussing the harm that anarchism has caused to the revolutionary cause, greatly enhancing the broad revolutionary workers' awareness of struggling against anarchist phenomena.

While exposing and criticizing anarchism, the broad revolutionary workers carried out a profound struggle to break private interests and establish public interests within their souls. The repair workshop, which first initiated the formulation of the "Grasp the Revolution, Promote Production" agreement, has been regularly checking the implementation of the agreement over the past few months, turning the process of implementing the agreement into a process of criticizing and repudiating oneself and others, and breaking private interests to establish public interests, further strengthening the unity between old and new workers, and completing the May state plan six and a half days ahead of schedule.

As a result of these efforts by the broad revolutionary workers of Qingdao Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Works, anarchist thoughts have been further overcome, socialist labor discipline has been greatly strengthened, the sense of responsibility of the broad revolutionary workers as masters of the house has reached an unprecedented height, effectively promoting the development of production. After completing 29% more than the state plan in the first quarter of this year, the entire factory completed 104.9% of the plan in April, and May's production increased by 13% compared to April.

    狠抓阶级斗争　加强社会主义劳动纪律
    青岛四方机车车辆厂进一步落实“抓革命，促生产公约”
    广大职工克服了无政府主义思潮的影响，促进生产不断发展，全厂四月份完成计划百分之一百零四点九，五月份生产又比四月份提高百分之十三
    据新华社济南十二日电　青岛四方机车车辆厂各车间、班组在普遍制订“抓革命，促生产公约”以后，继续狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，进一步落实“抓革命，促生产公约”。他们从几个月执行“抓革命，促生产公约”的实践中体会到，社会主义劳动纪律，只有在狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，以及破私立公的斗争中，才能建立和巩固起来。
    今年二月，四方机车车辆厂各车间普遍制订了“抓革命，促生产公约”，有力地抵制了无政府主义思潮的影响。但是，制订“抓革命，促生产公约”以后，并不是万事大吉了。一小撮阶级敌人不甘心自己的失败，他们继续煽阴风、点鬼火，破坏公约的贯彻执行。车间里不遵守社会主义劳动纪律的现象一度又有所抬头。柴油机车间加工七组的革命工人们，经过充分讨论，怀着对毛主席的无限忠心，写出了一张大字报，揭露了阶级敌人继续散布无政府主义的阴谋活动。这张大字报着重指出，不要认为公约一制订，无政府主义就会消声匿迹，社会主义的劳动纪律就可以不经过斗争而建立起来。公约产生了，但反对无政府主义的斗争并没有结束。制订公约，是一场严重的阶级斗争，执行公约，更是一场严重的阶级斗争。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，把无政府主义从思想上、政治上批倒批臭，清除产生无政府主义的根源。这张大字报一贴出，立即轰动了全车间二十多个班组，他们相继贴出大字报，表示热烈拥护和支持，并且掀起了革命大批判的高潮，挖出了制造分裂、散布无政府主义的一小撮坏家伙。厂革命委员会及时在全厂推广了他们的经验，把全厂反对无政府主义的斗争提高到两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的高度，掀起了更大规模的革命大批判的高潮。
    为了有力地领导这场斗争，厂革委会举办了车间、班组负责人参加的毛泽东思想学习班，集中对无政府主义进行批判。在学习班里，他们学习了毛主席的“军队向前进，生产长一寸，加强纪律性，革命无不胜”和“必须坚决地克服许多地方存在着的某些无纪律状态或无政府状态”的教导，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫散布的无政府主义反动谬论，大摆本厂走资派、叛徒、特务和反革命分子煽动无政府主义的罪行，大谈无政府主义给革命事业造成的危害，大大提高了广大革命职工同无政府主义现象作斗争的自觉性。
    在对无政府主义进行大揭露、大批判的同时，广大革命职工在自己灵魂深处展开了一场深刻的破私立公的斗争。首先发起制订“抓革命，促生产公约”的修机车间，几个月来经常检查公约的执行情况，把落实公约的过程变成斗私批修、破私立公的过程，进一步加强了新老工人之间的团结，提前六天半完成了五月份国家计划。
    青岛四方机车车辆厂广大革命职工这样做的结果，使无政府主义思想得到了进一步的克服，社会主义劳动纪律大大加强，广大革命职工当家做主的责任感空前提高，有效地推动了生产的发展。全厂继今年第一季度超额百分之二十九完成国家计划之后，四月份完成计划百分之一百零四点九，五月份的生产又比四月份提高百分之十三。
