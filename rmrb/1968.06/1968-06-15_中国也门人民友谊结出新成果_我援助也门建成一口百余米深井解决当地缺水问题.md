To celebrate the completion of the Mamala well in the Sana'a-Sada road project, built with Chinese aid, the Yemeni public held a grand gathering on the 3rd in Mamala, 20 kilometers from the Yemeni capital Sana'a.

The Mamala well, built with the assistance of Chinese technical personnel, is 113.84 meters deep and is the only mechanized well in this region, which was previously thought to have no underground water. It not only solves the water supply problem for the Sana'a-Sada road project passing through this region and the drinking water problem for local residents, but also prepares the conditions for irrigation.

To celebrate the completion of this well and to express the growing friendship between the peoples of Yemen and China, hundreds of local residents gathered early in the morning at the gathering site, dancing traditional local dances and singing national songs.

In his speech at the meeting, Yemeni Minister of Public Works Abdulla Kushmi said that the completion of this well is a great victory. The water shortage problem that has plagued this region for centuries has now been solved by Chinese technical personnel. He expressed heartfelt thanks on behalf of the Yemeni government and Prime Minister Amri to the Chinese government and Chinese technical personnel in Yemen.

Mohammed Ali Abu Rajala, Director of the Sana'a-Sada Road Project Management Bureau, also spoke.

In response to the invitation to attend the meeting, the acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Yemen, Zheng Kangping, and the representative of the Chinese technical team, Wang Huai-xian, spoke. They expressed gratitude to the Yemeni people and government for their assistance and cooperation with the Chinese technical personnel. Zheng Kangping emphasized that the friendship between the peoples of China and Yemen has a deep foundation, which is the struggle against our common enemy, American imperialism. He said that the Chinese government and people will firmly support the Yemeni people's struggle against American imperialism and reactionaries.

The meeting was filled with a warm and friendly atmosphere from beginning to end. The ancient village of Mamala echoed with slogans such as "Long live the friendship between the peoples of Yemen and China!"

    中国也门人民友谊结出新成果
    我援助也门建成一口百余米深井解决当地缺水问题
    新华社萨那电　为了庆祝中国援建的萨那—萨达公路工程马马拉井的建成，也门公众三日在距也门首都萨那二十公里的马马拉举行了盛大的集会。
    马马拉井是在中国技术人员的帮助下建成的，井深达一一三点八四米，是这个过去被认为没有地下水的地区的唯一机井。它不仅解决了为通过这个地区的萨那—萨达公路工程供水和这个地区居民饮水的问题，而且为灌溉准备了条件。
    为了庆祝这口井的建成和表达对也中两国人民日益加强的友谊的感情，数以百计的当地居民一清早就纷纷来到集会地点，聚集在一起跳当地传统舞蹈和唱民族歌曲。
    也门公共工程部长阿卜杜拉·库什米在会上讲话时说，这口井的建成是一个伟大胜利，这个地区几个世纪以来没有解决的缺水问题现在被中国技术人员解决了。他代表也门政府和阿姆里总理，向中国政府和在也门的中国技术人员表示衷心感谢。
    萨那—萨达公路工程管理局局长穆罕默德·阿里·阿布·雷贾勒也讲了话。
    应邀出席集会的中国驻也门大使馆临时代办郑康平和中国技术工作组代表王怀宪讲话时，感谢也门人民和也门政府对中国技术人员的帮助和合作。郑康平强调指出，中也两国人民之间的友谊有着深厚的基础，那就是反对我们共同的敌人美帝国主义的斗争。他说，中国政府和中国人民将坚决拥护、坚决支持也门人民反对美帝国主义和反动派的斗争。
    大会自始至终充满着热烈友好的气氛。古老的马马拉村回响着“也门—中国人民友好万岁！”等口号声。
