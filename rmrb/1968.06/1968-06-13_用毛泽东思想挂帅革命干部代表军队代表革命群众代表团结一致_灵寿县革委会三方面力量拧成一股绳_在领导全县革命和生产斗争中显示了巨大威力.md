The Lingxu County Revolutionary Committee in Hebei Province firmly adheres to the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought. The representatives of revolutionary cadres, military personnel, and revolutionary masses have closely united, combining the three forces into one, and have played a strong role as a revolutionary command center in the great struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The mass representatives participating in the county Revolutionary Committee follow Chairman Mao's instruction: "The reform of state organs, the most fundamental point, is to link up with the masses." They do not leave their original production or work positions and live, study, and fight together with the masses. The masses express their wishes and demands to them. They often bring the masses' opinions to the Revolutionary Committee and, at the same time, bring the committee's directives and resolutions to the masses, implementing and executing them together. They solve problems promptly, fully playing the role of a bridge between the Revolutionary Committee and the masses. In the early days after the establishment of the county Revolutionary Committee, there were many meetings. The worker and student representatives on the committee's standing committee heard the masses complain that the county held too many meetings and that the leaders went down to the grassroots less often. They suggested that the leaders reduce the number of meetings upstairs and go more often to the masses. The standing committee of the Revolutionary Committee took this opinion seriously and immediately organized the committee members to study Chairman Mao's teaching: "In the future, cadres should go down to the grassroots to walk around and see for themselves. They must adhere to the mass line, consult with the masses on every matter, and be the students of the masses." Everyone agreed that holding too many meetings upstairs would lead to detachment from the masses, and if this continued, it would lead to the danger of revisionism. They must correct this immediately. Afterwards, they significantly reduced the number of meetings, moved some meetings to the grassroots, and during the day, brought the problems to be solved to the masses, participating in labor together and seeking the masses' opinions, and then held meetings in the evening to discuss and solve the problems. This way, they grasped the masses' active thoughts accurately and solved the problems well.

The participation of military representatives in the Revolutionary Committee has further strengthened proletarian dictatorship and safeguarded the proletarian revolutionary regime. The military representatives brought Mao Zedong's thought on political building of the army into the Revolutionary Committee. They personally taught and passed on the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army in actively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing proletarian politics, adhering to the Four Firsts, and promoting the spirit of the Three-Eights. Especially in studying, propagating, and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, they grasped them tightly and firmly. After Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the construction of revolutionary committees were issued, the military representatives immediately proposed suggestions, which were studied and decided by the standing committee to quickly establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes to study and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. After studying, the committee members raised their awareness, quickly streamlined the organizations and personnel, and implemented unified leadership, making the Revolutionary Committee advance a big step on the path of revolutionization.

In the Revolutionary Committee, the revolutionary cadre representatives play a backbone role. They have made excellent contributions in grasping class struggle and policy implementation. A vice chairman of the county Revolutionary Committee, while working in a production brigade, learned about new issues in the struggle against the enemy. That evening, he raised this issue at the standing committee meeting. After discussion, everyone proposed measures to solve the problem and conveyed them through a telephone conference to all communes, quickly solving the problem and more firmly, accurately, and resolutely striking a small handful of class enemies. This vice chairman often used his past mistakes to educate new cadres, helping young people to better advance along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Because the three representatives have fully played their roles and the three forces have combined into one, the Revolutionary Committee has shown great power in leading the county's revolutionary and production struggles. Now, the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the county has entered a new stage. Various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes are vigorously grasping class struggle, deeply and persistently carrying out revolutionary criticism, and ceaselessly attacking class enemies. The revolutionary and production situation is excellent.

The basic experience of the Lingxu County Revolutionary Committee in fully playing the role of the three representatives is as follows:

First, use Mao Zedong Thought to unify the thoughts of the three representatives and guide their actions. Vice Chairman Lin instructed us: "Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all work of the entire Party, the entire army, and the entire country." After the establishment of the Lingxu County Revolutionary Committee, it vigorously grasped the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, using Mao Zedong Thought to hold power properly and use it well. When discussing issues, whoever's opinion is in line with Mao Zedong Thought is followed.

Second, vigorously grasp class struggle, and in the great waves of class struggle, build a stronger Revolutionary Committee. Chairman Mao taught us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power." After the establishment of the Lingxu County Revolutionary Committee, the committee members, under the help of the People's Liberation Army, closely united and led the broad revolutionary masses to actively attack the class enemies, smashing the class enemies' plots to sabotage the Revolutionary Committee, and tempering the Revolutionary Committee in the great waves of class struggle to become a truly united fighting collective.

Third, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and continuously improve work. Chairman Mao taught us: "Intra-party criticism is a weapon to strengthen the Party's organization and increase the Party's fighting capacity." "We have the weapon of criticism and self-criticism of Marxism-Leninism. We can get rid of bad work styles and maintain good work styles." When there are different opinions among the committee members, the Revolutionary Committee follows Chairman Mao's teachings, puts the problems on the table, carries out active ideological struggle, and reaches a consensus. This strengthens the unity among the committee members.

Fourth, respect each other, learn from each other, complement each other's strengths and weaknesses, and jointly improve. The three representatives of the Revolutionary Committee each have their strengths and weaknesses and must closely combine to do the work better. They follow Chairman Mao's teaching: "New and old cadres should respect each other, learn from each other, complement each other's strengths and weaknesses, so as to unite and work together for a common cause, and prevent the tendency of sectarianism." They humbly learn from each other's strengths to make up for their own weaknesses, continuously improve, and jointly progress in the common revolutionary cause.

    用毛泽东思想挂帅革命干部代表军队代表革命群众代表团结一致
    灵寿县革委会三方面力量拧成一股绳
    在领导全县革命和生产斗争中显示了巨大威力
    新华社石家庄十二日电　河北省灵寿县革委会坚持用毛泽东思想挂帅，革命干部代表、军队代表和革命群众代表紧密团结，三方面的力量拧成一股绳，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中，发挥了坚强的革命战斗指挥部的作用。
    参加县革委会的革命群众代表，遵循毛主席“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众”的教导，都不脱离原来的生产岗位和工作岗位，和群众学习、生活、战斗在一起，群众有什么愿望和要求，都对他们讲。他们经常把群众的意见带到革委会里来，同时把革委会的号召、决议及时带到群众中去，和群众一起贯彻执行，发现问题及时解决，充分发挥了革委会与群众之间的纽带作用。县革委会刚成立不久的一段时间内，会议比较多。县革委会常委中的工人代表和学生代表，听到群众反映县里开会太多，领导干部下去的少了，就建议领导干部少在上面开会，多到群众中去。革委会常委会很重视这个意见，立即组织常委们学习毛主席的教导：“以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。”大家一致认为，在上面开会多了，就会脱离群众，发展下去，就有变成修正主义的危险，必须马上改正。此后，他们大大减少了会议，有些会搬到基层去开，白天带着要解决的问题，和群众一起参加劳动，边劳动边征求群众的意见，晚上开会研究，这样，对群众的活思想抓得准，问题解决得好。
    军队代表参加革委会，更加强化了无产阶级专政，保卫了无产阶级的革命政权。军队代表把毛主席的政治建军思想，带进了革委会。他们身传言教，把人民解放军活学活用毛泽东思想，突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风的优良传统，传给革委会的成员。特别是对学习、宣传、落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，他们抓得紧，抓得狠。毛主席关于革命委员会建设的最新指示发表以后，军队代表立即提出建议，经常委会研究决定，迅速开办了毛泽东思想学习班，学习和落实毛主席的这一最新指示。革委会成员经过学习，提高了认识，很快精简了机构、人员，实行一元化的领导，使革委会在革命化的大道上迈进了一大步。
    在革命委员会中，革命干部代表起着骨干作用。他们在抓阶级斗争、掌握政策等方面，都作出了很好的贡献。县革委会的一位副主任，在生产大队劳动时，了解到对敌斗争中的新问题，当晚就把这个问题提到常委会研究，大家经过讨论提出了解决的措施，并通过电话会议传达给各公社，使问题很快得到解决，更加稳、准、狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人。这位副主任还经常用自己过去犯错误的教训，教育新干部，使青年人能够更好地沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利前进。
    由于三方面的代表充分发挥了作用，三股力量拧成了一股绳，革委会在领导全县革命和生产斗争中，显示了巨大的威力。现在，全县活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动进入了一个新阶段，各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，不停顿地向阶级敌人进攻，革命和生产形势一片大好。
    灵寿县革委会所以能够充分发挥三方面代表的作用，基本经验有四条：
    一、用毛泽东思想统一三方面代表的思想，指导三方面代表的行动。林副主席指示我们：“毛泽东思想是全党、全军和全国一切工作的指导方针。”灵寿县革委会成立后，狠抓活学活用毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想掌好权，用好权。常委之间讨论问题，谁的意见符合毛泽东思想，就照谁的办。
    二、狠抓阶级斗争，在阶级斗争的大风大浪里，把革委会建设得更坚强。毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”灵寿县革命委员会建立以后，革委会成员在人民解放军的帮助下，紧密地团结在一起，带领广大革命群众主动向阶级敌人猛烈进攻，粉碎阶级敌人破坏革命委员会的阴谋诡计，革委会在阶级斗争的大风大浪里锻炼得更坚强，真正成为一个团结一致的战斗集体。
    三、开展批评与自我批评，不断地改进工作。毛主席教导我们：“党内批评是坚强党的组织、增加党的战斗力的武器。”“我们有批评和自我批评这个马克思列宁主义的武器。我们能够去掉不良作风，保持优良作风。”革委会在遇到委员之间有不同意见时，遵照毛主席的教导，把问题摆到桌面上来，开展积极的思想斗争，以取得一致的认识。这样就增强了委员之间的团结。
    四、彼此尊重，互相学习，取长补短，共同提高。革委会三方面的代表各有所长，各有所短，必须紧密结合，才能把工作做得更好。他们遵循毛主席“新老干部应该是彼此尊重，互相学习，取长补短，以便团结一致，进行共同的事业，而防止宗派主义的倾向”的教导，虚心学习别人的优点，以补自己的不足，在共同的革命事业中不断提高，共同进步。
