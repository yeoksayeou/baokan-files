In the triumphant chorus of the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the "Wei Dongying" revolutionary criticism combat group of the Shanghai garrison troops, filled with boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, repeatedly reviewed Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and the "Summary of the Conference on Army Literature and Art Work Convened by Comrade Lin Biao and Directed by Comrade Jiang Qing." Reflecting on the two years of struggle under the guidance of the radiant "Talks" and the "Summary," which embodies Chairman Mao's thoughts on literature and art, we deeply feel that Chairman Mao's great teachings are eternal truths, invincible weapons, and guiding lights leading us to victory.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a political revolution under the conditions of socialism, where the proletariat opposes the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary masses under its leadership and the Kuomintang reactionaries. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Through the two years of practice in the Cultural Revolution, we deeply understand that the criticism of the revisionist literary line is essentially a life-and-death struggle against the bourgeois representatives who wield the pen and the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries.

In November 1965, under the personal leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao and the direct guidance of Comrade Jiang Qing, Comrade Yao Wenyuan's "On the New Historical Drama 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office'" opened the unprecedented curtain of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In the thunderous roar of the proletariat's fierce counterattack against the bourgeoisie, we, who came from the front lines of airports, anti-aircraft artillery positions, border outposts, and other combat posts, formed a combat collective. We picked up our pens and charged into the front lines of class struggle. With boundless indignation towards the class enemies, we aimed our fire at the anti-party, anti-socialist poisonous weed "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office"! We quickly sent a batch of criticism manuscripts to the newspaper.

However, it is infuriating that some manuscripts that hit the key issues of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" were suppressed by a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the old Shanghai Municipal Party Committee. This issue drew our serious attention. Why, on the socialist literary front, are workers, peasants, and soldiers not allowed to criticize the anti-party, anti-socialist poisonous weed "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office"?!" Thus, we repeatedly studied the "Talks" and Chairman Mao's discussions on class struggle. Chairman Mao had long ago pointed out with piercing insight: "In the past, they were said to be a group of pure cultural figures, which is not correct. They have infiltrated into the political, military, economic, cultural, and educational departments. In the past, they were said to be like a group of revolutionary parties with open arms, which is not correct. Most of their people have serious problems. Their main forces are either imperialist Kuomintang spies, Trotskyites, reactionary officers, or traitors of the Communist Party. These people form the backbone of a counter-revolutionary faction hidden within the revolutionary ranks, an underground independent kingdom." With the mirror of Mao Zedong Thought, the problem was clear. These so-called "cultural figures" and the small clique of capitalist roaders within the party who support them are indeed the agents of the bourgeoisie and the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries who have infiltrated the revolutionary ranks. They, from top to bottom, have implemented a black line that is opposed to Chairman Mao's thoughts and have seized power in many cultural and artistic departments.

At this critical moment when the proletariat is launching a comprehensive offensive against the bourgeoisie, this small clique of bourgeois representatives and remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries are desperately struggling to preserve themselves, using the cultural power they have usurped. This is not just a matter of handling manuscripts; it is a continuation of their fascist dictatorship over us workers, peasants, and soldiers. The struggle is so complex, and the enemy is so rampant. How can we revolutionary soldiers not counterattack? They can suppress our manuscripts, but they cannot suppress our will to fight to the death with the class enemies. We not only aimed our fire at the key issues of the poisonous weed "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" and the revisionist literary black line but also pursued and attacked, striking at their stronghold, launching a fierce assault on the biggest clique of capitalist roaders within the party.

In this unprecedented fierce struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang reactionaries on the cultural front, Chairman Mao is our supreme commander. We are the red cultural vanguards of Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is always directing our battles. We must follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments step by step.

In the battle, due to our low cultural level, lack of writing experience, and lack of materials, we encountered a series of difficulties. However, to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line to the death, to let workers, peasants, and soldiers occupy the socialist literary front, and to defeat the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm, we, with our loyal hearts to the great commander Chairman Mao, drew immense strength from the "Talks," armed our minds with the brilliant thoughts of the "Talks," and became invincible.

Over the past two years, from criticizing "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" to launching a comprehensive offensive against the revisionist literary black line of Zhou Yang, from criticizing "The Secret History of the Palace" to directly aiming at the biggest clique of capitalist roaders within the party, launching a fierce assault on the Chinese Khrushchev, and fiercely criticizing "Spark," "Stormy Waves," "Red River Waves," and other poisonous weeds that erect monuments to anti-party conspirators. Wherever Chairman Mao points, we fight there. Under the invincible guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we have published more than 150 criticism manuscripts in various newspapers and radio stations, dealing a heavy blow to the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line and its backers. In the process of intense criticism, our combat collective has been tempered, and our awareness of class struggle and line struggle has been raised.

One comrade in our group, who had never written a criticism article before, wrote more than ten criticism manuscripts in two months. At first, none of them were published. But he always maintained a fierce fighting spirit and firmly declared: "I am not writing for myself; I am fighting to defend Chairman Mao." Later, under the great encouragement of the "Talks," in the hot summer, he wrote for twelve consecutive days, from night to early morning, and then started writing again the next day. He discussed with his comrades and wrote four drafts, finally completing a more than ten-thousand-word article criticizing the poisonous weed film "The Peony Pavilion," which was published in two Shanghai newspapers.

Through the two years of struggle, we deeply feel that this unprecedented broad and profound political revolution in the ideological realm on the literary front can only be thoroughly cleared of all the poison spread by the exploiting classes in the ideological and cultural realm by fully mobilizing the masses and launching a broad and deep revolutionary criticism of the revisionist literary black line.

Is the criticism group writing articles by themselves or going to the fiery mass struggle, working with the masses to launch revolutionary criticism, and fully mobilizing the broad cadres and soldiers to criticize the bourgeoisie? We have gone through a process of understanding and struggle on this issue. The members of our combat group, except for a few leading cadres and office workers, are all from the grassroots level, including platoon leaders, political instructors, squad leaders, mechanics, communication operators, gunners, radar operators, searchlight operators, and nurses. At first, we felt that we were the masses, the soldiers, and there was no need to go deep into the masses and mobilize the masses. We just needed to publish a few high-quality criticism articles in the newspapers. The result was that we wrote in isolation, fought alone, and thus deviated from reality and could not keep up with the needs of the revolutionary criticism movement.

With this problem in mind, we again sought answers from the "Talks" and the "Summary." The "Summary" clearly points out: "We should advocate revolutionary, combative, and mass literary criticism, ... and hand over the weapons of literary criticism to the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers." In the past, we relied on the broad revolutionary masses, picked up our guns, and fought a people's war, defeating the Kuomintang reactionaries. Now, under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, we must rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and let everyone pick up the pen and become a critic, fighting a "people's war" in the ideological realm.

Following Chairman Mao's consistent teachings, many of our comrades immediately packed their bags. Some went to the front lines of "three supports and two militaries," some returned to their combat posts, and some went deep into heroic companies and exemplary units, learning from the masses and propagating the principles of revolutionary criticism. They helped solve problems in the criticism process, held criticism meetings, set up criticism columns, and compiled criticism teaching materials. Under the leadership of various levels of party committees in the army, the broad cadres and soldiers, with their mouths and pens, launched wave after wave of revolutionary criticism.

In the fiery class struggle, we studied, criticized, and wrote with the cadres and soldiers. In November last year, we wrote an article titled "The Whole World Can Only Be Transformed by the Gun" for a magazine, systematically criticizing the revisionist black goods of Zhou Yang and his ilk's "anti-gunpowder smell" theory and their representative works over the past seventeen years since the founding of the nation. At that time, the editorial department proposed that the quality of the manuscript should be high and the content should be substantial. The comrades of the criticism group went to the wired communications company, which had been rated as a "four-good company" for six consecutive years, and formed a temporary criticism group with a few soldiers who had never written criticism articles. The comrades of the criticism group seriously studied the soldiers' thoughts and feelings and their plain language, from collecting materials and discussing outlines to the final draft, always studying and writing together with the soldiers, and finally completed the task relatively well.

Over the past two years, the process of our group's revolutionary criticism has been a process of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, criticizing and repudiating oneself, promoting the revolutionization of thought, and learning from the masses. Under the close care and enthusiastic support of the army leaders and the broad revolutionary soldiers, more than 90% of the soldiers in our combat group were rated as "five-good," five comrades were rated as active learners of Chairman Mao's works in the army, and more than thirty cadres were trained as backbones for revolutionary criticism.

The struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between the two lines, on the literary front is long-term, sharp, and tortuous. This is a prominent reflection of class struggle under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The "Summary" points out: "After eliminating this black line, there will still be future black lines, and we will have to fight again." Therefore, we must carry forward the spirit of thorough proletarian revolution, advance victoriously, and launch a more in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism. We must do it every day, every month, every year, and forever. We will fight it for ten years, eight years, several decades, or even several centuries.

    拿起笔，握紧枪，坚决捍卫无产阶级专政
    卫东鹰
    在无产阶级文化大革命取得全面胜利的凯歌声中，我们驻沪部队“卫东鹰”革命大批判战斗组，满怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的深厚感情，一遍又一遍地重温了毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》和《林彪同志委托江青同志召开的部队文艺工作座谈会纪要》。回顾了在光芒四射的《讲话》和体现毛主席文艺思想的《纪要》的指引下，两年来在无产阶级文化大革命的峥嵘岁月里所走过的战斗历程，我们深深感到毛主席的伟大教导是万古长新的真理，所向披靡的锐利武器，指引我们胜利前进的明灯。
    毛主席最近指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”通过两年来文化大革命的斗争实践，我们深深地体会到，对修正主义文艺黑线的批判，实质上就是和拿着笔杆子的资产阶级代表人物、国民党反动派残渣余孽的生死斗争。
    一九六五年十一月，在伟大领袖毛主席的亲自领导下，在江青同志的直接指导下，姚文元同志的《评新编历史剧〈海瑞罢官〉》，揭开了史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的序幕。在无产阶级向资产阶级发起猛烈反击的隆隆炮声中，我们这些来自机场、高炮阵地、边防哨所等战斗岗位的干部、战士，结成了一个战斗集体，拿起笔杆，杀向阶级斗争的前哨阵地。大家怀着对阶级敌人无比的愤慨，对准反党反社会主义的大毒草《海瑞罢官》猛烈开火！迅速地把一批批判稿件寄给了报社。
    但是，令人气愤的是，一些击中《海瑞罢官》要害问题的稿件，却被旧上海市委内一小撮反革命修正主义分子扣压下来了。这个问题引起了我们的严重注意，为什么在社会主义的文艺阵地上，不让工农兵批判反党反社会主义的大毒草《海瑞罢官》？！于是，我们反复地学习《讲话》和毛主席关于阶级斗争的论述。毛主席早就一针见血地指出：“过去说是一批单纯的文化人，不对了，他们的人钻进了政治、军事、经济、文化、教育各个部门里。过去说他们好象是一批明火执仗的革命党，不对了，他们的人大都是有严重问题的。他们的基本队伍，或是帝国主义国民党的特务，或是托洛茨基分子，或是反动军官，或是共产党的叛徒，由这些人做骨干组成了一个暗藏在革命阵营的反革命派别，一个地下的独立王国。”用毛泽东思想的照妖镜一照，问题就明白了。这些所谓“文化人”以及支持他们的党内一小撮走资派，正是混入革命队伍的资产阶级代理人以及国民党反动派的残渣余孽。他们从上到下，推行了一条和毛主席思想相对立的反党反社会主义的黑线，并且在许多文化艺术部门里专了我们的政。
    在无产阶级向资产阶级开展全面进攻的关键时刻，这一小撮资产阶级代表人物、国民党反动派的残渣余孽，极力利用他们窃取的文化大权，垂死挣扎，妄图保存自己，以便继续向无产阶级进攻。这那是一般稿件处理问题，明明是继续对我们工农兵实行法西斯专政。斗争这样复杂，敌人这样猖狂，我们革命战士能不反击吗！他们能压住我们的稿件，但压不住我们和阶级敌人血战到底的战斗意志。我们不仅对准大毒草《海瑞罢官》的要害猛烈开火，对准修正主义文艺黑线猛烈开火，而且穷追猛打，直捣他们的老巢，向党内最大的一小撮走资派猛烈进攻。
    在这场文化战线上无产阶级和资产阶级、共产党和国民党反动派空前激烈的斗争中，毛主席是我们的最高统帅，我们是毛主席的红色文艺尖兵，毛主席时刻在指挥我们战斗，我们必须步步紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。
    在战斗中，由于我们文化水平低，写作经验少，又缺乏资料，遇到一系列困难。但是，为了誓死捍卫毛主席的革命文艺路线，为了让工农兵占领社会主义的文艺阵地，为了在意识形态方面战胜资产阶级，我们怀着对伟大统帅毛主席的赤胆忠心，从《讲话》中汲取巨大力量，用《讲话》的光辉思想武装头脑，就无往而不胜。
    两年多来，从批判《海瑞罢官》到向周扬修正主义文艺黑线全面出击，从批判《清宫秘史》到直指党内最大一小撮走资派，猛攻中国赫鲁晓夫，狠批《燎原》、《怒潮》、《红河激浪》等为反党野心家树碑立传的大毒草。毛主席指向那里，我们战斗到那里。在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，我们在各种报刊、电台上，共发表了批判稿一百五十多篇，给反革命修正主义文艺黑线及其总后台以沉重的打击。在大批判过程中，锻炼了我们这个战斗集体，提高了我们阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟。
    我们小组一个从来没有写过批判文章的同志，两个多月里，先后写了十几篇批判稿，起先一篇也没有被刊用。但他始终保持旺盛的战斗意志，坚决表示：我不是为个人写稿，我是为保卫毛主席而战斗。以后，他在《讲话》的巨大鼓舞下，在炎热的夏季，一连十二天，每天写到深夜两、三点钟，第二天一早起来又写，和同志们反复研究，写了四稿，终于写成了一万多字的批判毒草影片《桃花扇》的文章，发表在上海两家报纸上。
    通过两年来的斗争实践，我们深切地体会到，文艺战线上这场意识形态领域里空前广阔、空前深刻的政治大革命，只有充分发动群众，对修正主义文艺黑线开展广泛、深入的革命大批判，才能在政治上、思想上、理论上彻底肃清一切剥削阶级在思想文化领域内所散布的流毒。
    批判组是关起门来自己写文章，还是到火热的群众斗争中去，和群众一起开展革命的大批判，充分发动广大干部战士批判资产阶级？这个问题，我们是有一个认识和斗争过程的。我们这个战斗组的成员，除了个别领导干部和机关干部外，都是来自基层的连长、指导员、排长、机械员、报务员、炮手、雷达操纵手、探照灯手、护士等。开始，我们感到自己就是群众，就是兵，没有必要再深入群众，发动群众，只要能在报上发表几篇质量较高的批判文章就行了。结果是关门写稿，孤军奋斗，因而脱离实际，赶不上革命大批判发展形势的需要。
    我们带着这个问题，又一次从《讲话》和《纪要》中寻找答案。《纪要》中明确指出：“要提倡革命的战斗的群众性的文艺批评，……把文艺批评的武器交给广大工农兵群众去掌握”。过去，我们依靠广大革命群众，拿起枪杆子，进行人民战争，打败了国民党反动派；现在，在无产阶级专政条件下，我们更要依靠群众，发动群众，人人拿起笔杆子，个个都当批判家，打一场意识形态领域里的“人民战争”。
    遵循毛主席的一贯教导，我们许多同志立即打起背包，有的奔赴“三支”“两军”第一线，有的回到自己的战斗岗位，有的深入英雄连队、四好单位，拜群众为师，向群众学习。同时向他们宣传革命大批判的道理，帮助他们解决大批判中的问题，召开批判会，办大批判专栏，编写大批判教材。在部队各级党委的领导下，广大干部战士，人人口诛笔伐，掀起一个又一个革命大批判的热潮。
    在火热的阶级斗争中，我们和干部战士同学习、同批判、同写作。去年十一月份，我们为刊物写了一篇《整个世界只有用枪杆子才能改造》的文章，系统地批判建国十七年来，周扬之流“反火药味”论的修正主义黑货及其代表作品。当时，编辑部提出稿件质量要高，分量要重。批判组的同志来到连续六年被评为“四好连队”的有线电连，和几个没有写过批判文章的战士，组成临时批判小组。批判组的同志认真学习战士们的思想感情和朴实的语言，从搜集材料、讨论提纲，到最后定稿，始终和战士们一起研究，共同执笔，终于较好地完成了这个任务。
    两年来，我们小组开展革命大批判的过程，就是活学活用毛主席著作，斗私批修，促进思想革命化的过程，就是向群众学习的过程。在部队首长以及广大革命战士的亲切关怀和热情支持下，我们这个战斗组，百分之九十以上的战士被评为五好，五个同志被评为部队学习毛主席著作积极分子，还为部队培养了三十多名大批判的骨干。
    文艺战线上无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级、两条路线的斗争，是长期的、尖锐的、曲折的，这是无产阶级专政条件下阶级斗争的突出反映。《纪要》指出：“搞掉这条黑线之后，还会有将来的黑线，还得再斗争。”因此，我们必须发扬无产阶级彻底革命精神，乘胜前进，更加深入持久地开展革命的大批判，天天搞，月月搞，年年搞，永远搞，斗它十年、八年，斗它几十年、几百年。
