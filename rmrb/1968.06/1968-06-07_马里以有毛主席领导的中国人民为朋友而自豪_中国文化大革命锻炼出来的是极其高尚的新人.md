Mali's Defense and Security Minister-level Representative and Head of the Mali Military Delegation, Mamadou Diaguitte, held a farewell banquet here tonight.

Chinese People's Liberation Army Chief of the General Staff Huang Yongsheng, and various leaders from the PLA General Staff, various military branches, relevant departments, and the Beijing Revolutionary Committee, including Xiao Jingguang and Wang Xinting, as well as representatives from the PLA's army, navy, and air force, and representatives from the capital's militia and Red Guards, were invited to attend the banquet.

At the banquet, filled with a warm and friendly atmosphere, Mamadou Diaguitte and Huang Yongsheng both spoke. Mamadou Diaguitte said, "After our six-day visit, we have seen how the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the guidance of the genius thoughts of the great Mao Zedong, has deeply influenced the Chinese masses. Soldiers, workers, peasants, intellectuals, youth, and the elderly are all fighting shoulder to shoulder, inspired and guided by Mao Zedong Thought, to achieve victory in the greatest revolutionary movement of our time. We are happy to see that the new people forged from this great movement are extremely noble, selfless, and will play a better role in the future genuine communist society."

Mamadou Diaguitte said, "We particularly express our respect for the decisive role played by the People's Liberation Army, which is led by Vice Chairman Lin Biao and holds high the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought."

Mamadou Diaguitte condemned the brutal suppression by imperialism against the African people striving for national independence and the naked threats and even invasions against African countries that are fighting to consolidate their national independence. He pointed out that although imperialism appears strong, their days are numbered in Africa and around the world.

Mamadou Diaguitte said, "Under the leadership of our country's wise leader, President Modibo Keita, the Republic of Mali will fully support the just struggle of the people striving for complete independence. Mali is proud to have the great Chinese people, led by the great helmsman Chairman Mao, as friends."

Huang Yongsheng then spoke. He said, "The Mali friends' enthusiastic praise for our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and our army expresses the friendly feelings of the Mali people and the Mali army towards our people and our army. The people of China and Mali have always sympathized with, supported, and encouraged each other in our long-term struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism, forming a close combat friendship. He said, "In the struggle of the Mali people against imperialism and its running dogs, the Chinese people will firmly stand by your side, actively support your struggle, and strive for complete victory."

Huang Yongsheng pointed out that now, the world revolution has entered a great new era. The revolutionary consciousness of the world's people has reached an unprecedented height, and the revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries are surging to new highs. When talking about the armed revolutionary struggles of the Asian, African, and Latin American peoples against imperialism and the revolutionary mass struggles rising in the United States and Europe, he said, "People are increasingly seeing that the days of imperialist rule are numbered, and they are living from day to day."

Huang Yongsheng said, "Imperialism and reactionaries will not withdraw from the historical stage on their own. President Modibo Keita said well: 'Currently, there are imperialist forces, and they have not given up their attempts to further rule Africa.' Huang Yongsheng strongly condemned the aggression of imperialism, led by U.S. imperialism, in Africa, and strongly condemned the modern revisionist clique's counter-revolutionary line of false support and true betrayal against the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Africa and Arab countries. He said, "As our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: 'The desperate struggles of imperialism and reactionaries will only make the peoples of the various countries of Africa more alert and more determined to struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism, to defend national independence, and to strive for the prosperity and progress of their own countries.' We believe that as long as the peoples of the various countries of Africa and the Arab world strengthen their unity and persist in their struggle, they will certainly be able to smash the imperialist counter-offensive and achieve final victory."

Also invited to the banquet were ambassadors from African countries to China and military attachés from other countries' embassies to China. Mali's Chargé d'Affaires at the Embassy in China, Koulibaly, also attended the banquet.

    马马杜·迪亚基特团长在告别宴会上说
    马里以有毛主席领导的中国人民为朋友而自豪
    中国文化大革命锻炼出来的是极其高尚的新人
    黄永胜总参谋长说，中马人民在长期反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的共同斗争中，互相支持，互相鼓舞，结成了亲密的战斗友谊。中国人民坚定不移地支持马里人民反对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争，直到取得彻底胜利。
    新华社六日讯　马里共和国负责国防和安全的部长级代表、马里军事代表团团长马马杜·迪亚基特，今晚在这里举行告别宴会。
    中国人民解放军总参谋长黄永胜，人民解放军各总部、各军种、兵种，有关方面和北京市革命委员会的各负责人萧劲光、王新亭等，以及人民解放军陆、海、空三军代表，首都民兵和红卫兵小将的代表，应邀出席了宴会。
    在充满着热烈友好气氛的宴会上，马马杜·迪亚基特团长和黄永胜总参谋长先后讲了话。马马杜·迪亚基特说，我们在访问六天以后，使我们看到，在伟大毛泽东的天才思想指导下的无产阶级文化大革命，是怎样深刻地影响了中国人民群众。包括士兵、工人、农民、知识分子、青年人和老年人，他们都在毛泽东思想的鼓舞和指导下，为夺取当代最伟大的革命运动的胜利而并肩战斗。我们高兴地看到，从这场伟大运动中锻炼出来的新人，是极其高尚的人，是摆脱自私的人，是能在将来的真正的共产主义社会中更好地起作用的人。
    马马杜·迪亚基特说，我们特别高兴地向在林彪副主席领导下、高举伟大的毛泽东思想的革命旗帜的人民解放军所起的决定性作用，表示敬意。
    马马杜·迪亚基特谴责帝国主义对正在争取民族独立的非洲人民进行的残酷镇压，对正在为巩固民族独立和斗争的非洲国家进行赤裸裸的威胁，甚至侵略。他指出，尽管帝国主义表面上强大，他们在非洲和全世界的寿命是不长了。
    马马杜·迪亚基特说，在我国人民的英明领袖莫迪博·凯塔总统领导下的马里共和国，将全力支持正在争取彻底独立的人民的正义斗争。马里以有在伟大的舵手毛主席领导下的伟大的中国人民这样的朋友而感到自豪。
    黄永胜同志接着讲话。他说，马里朋友对我国无产阶级文化大革命和我军的热情赞扬，表达了马里人民和马里军队对我国人民和我国军队的友好感情。中马两国人民在长期反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的共同斗争中，一向互相同情，互相支持，互相鼓舞，结成了亲密的战斗友谊。他说，在马里人民反对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争中，中国人民将坚定不移地站在你们一边，积极支持你们的斗争，直到取得彻底胜利。
    黄永胜同志指出，现在，世界革命已经进入了一个伟大的新时代。世界人民的革命觉悟空前提高，各国人民的革命斗争正在走向新的高潮。他在谈到亚非拉人民反帝革命武装斗争和美国、欧洲兴起的革命群众斗争的大风暴时说，人们越来越清楚地看到，帝国主义统治已经面临末日，朝不保夕了。
    黄永胜同志说，帝国主义和反动派是不会自行退出历史舞台的。莫迪博·凯塔总统说得好：“目前存在着帝国主义力量，他们并没有放弃进一步统治非洲的企图”。黄永胜同志强烈谴责以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义在非洲的侵略，强烈谴责现代修正主义集团对非洲和阿拉伯各国人民的反帝革命斗争推行假支持、真出卖的反革命路线。他说，正如我们伟大领袖毛主席指出的：“帝国主义和反动派的疯狂挣扎只会使非洲各国人民更加提高警惕，更加坚定地为反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义、为维护民族独立和争取自己国家的繁荣进步而奋斗。”我们相信，只要非洲和阿拉伯各国人民加强团结，坚持斗争，就一定能够粉碎帝国主义的阴谋反扑，取得最后胜利。
    应邀出席宴会的还有，非洲国家驻中国使节和其他国家驻中国大使馆武官。马里驻中国大使馆临时代办库里巴利也出席宴会作陪。
