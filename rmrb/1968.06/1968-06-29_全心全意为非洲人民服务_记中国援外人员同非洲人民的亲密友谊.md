Chinese engineering and technical personnel and medical staff working in Africa have always remembered Chairman Mao's teaching that "the people who have already won revolutionary victory should help the people who are still struggling for liberation, and this is our internationalist duty." In their work, they actively apply Mao Zedong Thought, wholeheartedly serving the people of Africa, and have forged deep friendships with the local people. "Long live the friendship between the people of Mali and China!"

The banks of the Niger River in Mali are rich in cotton, and the Malian people have long hoped to build their own textile factory to produce cotton cloth from domestically grown cotton. During the trial production period of the newly constructed Segou Combined Textile Factory, built with Chinese aid, crowds of people would come every day to visit, filled with joy. They came not only from the capital, Bamako, and other parts of Mali, but also from neighboring countries such as Senegal, Ivory Coast, and Upper Volta.

One day, an elderly Malian woman entered the bleaching workshop of the factory. As soon as she saw the freshly spun white cotton yarn, she hurried over and hugged it tightly, her eyes filled with tears of joy and excitement. This was cotton yarn produced by a Malian factory! How could one not be excited and thrilled? Many Malian friends shouted "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" during their visit. They praised, "The Chinese people are true friends of the Malian people." A Malian youth made clothes from the first batch of cotton cloth produced by the textile factory and felt very proud. As he left the factory after the visit, he excitedly said, "When I go back, I will definitely tell everyone about China's aid to Mali." A Malian government official told the Chinese engineering and technical personnel who helped build the factory, "The Malian people have always wanted to build a textile factory using domestically grown cotton, but it has never been possible. Now, with the sincere help of China, the Malian people finally have their own textile factory!" He shouted, "Long live the friendship between the people of Mali and China!" and sincerely wished the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China even greater victories.

		Friends in Need

The waters of the Niger River kept rising, causing floods, and many houses along the river in Segou, the second-largest city in Mali, were seriously threatened. The local people actively participated in the flood control struggle. Chinese engineering and technical personnel, who were helping to build the textile factory, immediately rushed to the scene upon hearing the news, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "wholeheartedly serving the people." They fought side by side with the Malian people and provided many necessary materials for flood control. The Chinese technicians stood in water up to their knees, fearlessly overcoming hardships, and worked tirelessly. They continuously recited Chairman Mao's quotations and sang revolutionary songs, encouraging each other and the Malian people to overcome all difficulties. They built over two hundred meters of flood control embankment in one go. The local people were deeply moved by this vivid example of the Chinese technicians' work ethic, which they had witnessed in their daily overseas aid work, where they fearlessly endured wind, rain, and sun, and did not fear hard work. Some people enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" Afterward, a local administrative official told the Chinese technicians, "Chinese friends have once again helped us in our time of greatest difficulty. Truly, friends in need are friends indeed!"

		"Chairman Mao is my savior!"

One day, an ambulance from Lenin Hospital in Tanzania rushed a severely bleeding Mozambican woman, Lucinda, from a village thirty miles away in Zanzibar. The woman's heartbeat was very weak, her blood pressure was undetectable, and her life was in danger. The Chinese medical team's obstetrics and gynecology staff immediately sprang into action to save her life. At that time, a foreign gynecologist working in the hospital saw the woman in labor and shook his head, believing she could not be saved. He maliciously told the Chinese medical staff, "The patient will not survive. You are just showing a bit of humanitarianism."

The Chinese medical staff firmly replied, "The patient is a poor African farmer. As long as there is a glimmer of hope, we will do everything we can to save her!"

The foreign gynecologist, hearing this, was not convinced and said mockingly, "Well, then go ahead and try!"

Faced with this arduous rescue mission, the entire Chinese medical team remembered Chairman Mao's teachings of "wholeheartedly serving the people" and "resolving to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory." They wrote these two quotations from Chairman Mao in both Chinese and Swahili on a plaque and hung it up as a motto. Whenever they encountered difficulties or were exhausted from work, they would look up at Chairman Mao's portrait, recite his affectionate teachings, and feel an endless source of strength. This life-saving battle lasted for five days and five nights. The Chinese obstetrics and gynecology staff, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, worked together with the internal medicine, surgery, and the entire medical team to finally save the life of this poor African woman.

On the day the patient was discharged, the Chinese medical staff drove her all the way back to her home thirty miles away. Lucinda and her family were extremely grateful to the Chinese medical staff.

As they parted, she reluctantly held the hands of the Chinese medical staff and said, "Chairman Mao is my savior! I will hang a portrait of Chairman Mao on the main wall of my house, and our entire family will forever remember his kindness."

    全心全意为非洲人民服务
    ——记中国援外人员同非洲人民的亲密友谊
    远在非洲工作的中国援外工程技术人员和医务人员，牢记毛主席的“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争，这是我们的国际主义的义务”的教导，在工作中活学活用毛泽东思想，全心全意为非洲人民服务，同当地人民结下了深厚的友谊。“马中两国人民的友谊万岁！”
    流经马里的尼日尔河两岸盛产棉花，马里人民一直期望建设自己的纺织厂，用国产棉花生产棉布。在中国帮助建设的塞古联合纺织厂基本建成投入试产期间，每天都有成群结队的人怀着喜悦的心情前往参观。他们不仅来自首都巴马科和马里的其他地区，而且来自塞内加尔、象牙海岸和上沃尔特等邻近国家。
    一天，一位马里老大娘走进这个工厂的漂染车间参观时，一眼看到机器刚纺出来的洁白的棉纱，高兴得快步走上前去把它紧紧搂在怀里，两眼充满了喜悦而激动的泪花。这是马里自己的工厂生产出来的棉纱啊！怎么不叫人感到激动和兴奋呢！许多马里朋友在参观过程中不断高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”他们称赞“中国人民是马里人民真正的朋友”。一位马里青年用纺织厂生产的第一批棉布做了衣服后感到十分自豪。他在参观结束离开工厂时激动地说：“我回去后，一定要把中国对马里的援助讲给大家听。”一位马里政府官员告诉援建该厂的中国工程技术人员说：“马里人民以前总想建设一座用国产棉花作原料的纺织厂，但一直无法实现。如今，马里人民在中国的真诚援助下终于有了自己的纺织厂了！”他高呼：“马中两国人民的友谊万岁！”并衷心祝愿中国无产阶级文化大革命取得更大胜利。
          患难知朋友
    尼日尔河河水不断上涨，泛滥成灾，马里第二大城市塞古市沿河的许多民房遭受洪水的严重威胁，当地人民都积极参加防洪斗争。正在那里帮助建设纺织厂的中国工程技术人员遵照毛主席“全心全意地为人民服务”的教导，闻讯后立即奔赴现场，投入紧张的斗争。他们与马里人民并肩作战，并且支援了许多防洪的必需物资。中国技术人员站在水深齐膝的大水中，不畏艰险，连续奋战。他们口里不断齐声朗读毛主席语录，高唱革命歌曲，与马里人民团结一心，互相鼓舞斗志，克服了种种困难，一口气建筑了二百多米长的防洪堤。当地人民从中国工程技术人员的这个生动的事例中，联想到他们平时在援外建设工作中不怕风吹、雨淋、日晒，不怕艰苦劳累的工作作风，都十分感动。有的还满怀激情地高呼：“毛泽东主席万岁！”事后，当地的一位行政负责官员向中国技术人员说：“中国朋友在我们最困难的时刻又一次帮助了我们，真是患难知朋友！”
      “毛主席是我的救命恩人！”
    一天，坦桑尼亚列宁医院的救护车从桑给巴尔市三十里外的农村，紧急运来了一位大出血的莫三鼻给族产妇露西迪娜。产妇的心跳已经十分微弱，血压不显，生命垂危。在列宁医院工作的中国医疗队的妇产科同志马上全力以赴投入紧张的抢救工作。这时，在该院工作的一个外国妇科医生看到这位难产病人，便摇头不止，认为已经无法挽救。他恶意地对中国医务人员说：“病人不会活了，你们无非是尽点人道主义罢了。”
    中国医务人员坚定地回答说：“病人是一个非洲贫苦农妇，只要还有一点希望，我们一定要尽一切力量抢救她！”
    这个外国妇科医生听后很不以为然，带着嘲笑的口气说：“好吧，那么你们就试一试吧！”
    中国医疗队全体成员面临这一艰巨的抢救任务，牢记毛主席“全心全意地为人民服务”和“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导。他们在抢救病人的工作室内把这两条毛主席语录用中文和斯瓦希利文写在语录牌上，挂起来当作座右铭。每当工作遇到困难或紧张劳累的时候，他们便仰望毛主席像，默诵毛主席的亲切教导，身上就充满了无穷无尽的战斗力量。这场救死扶伤的战斗经历了五天五夜。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国妇产科医务人员，在内科、外科以及医疗队全体同志的奋力协作下，终于救活了这位非洲贫苦妇女。
    病人出院那天，中国医务人员还用车把她一直送回三十里外的家里。露西迪娜一家人都万分感激中国医务人员。
    临别时，她依依不舍地拉着中国医务人员的手说：“毛主席是我的救命恩人！我要把毛主席的像挂在我家的正墙上，我们全家将永远记住他老人家的恩情。”　（新华社二十八日讯）（附图片）
