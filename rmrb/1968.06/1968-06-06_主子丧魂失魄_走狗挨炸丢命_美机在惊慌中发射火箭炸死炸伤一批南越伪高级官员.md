The master loses his soul and spirit, running dogs get bombed and die
American aircraft in panic fires rockets, killing and injuring a batch of high-ranking South Vietnamese officials

	NEW DELHI, June 4 (Xinhua) - According to reports from Saigon, the U.S.-puppet clique is in a state of panic due to the heavy blows dealt by the heroic armed forces of South Vietnam. On June 2, a U.S. helicopter in a state of panic fired rockets that hit a command post of the puppet army in Saigon, killing and injuring ten high-ranking military and political officials of the puppet regime.

	According to Western news agencies, those killed include: the puppet "Chief of Saigon Police" Nguyen Van Lam, the puppet "Commander of the Fifth Special Forces" Dao Ba Phu, the puppet "Administrative Director of Saigon Police" Nguyen Ngoc Thanh, the puppet "Commander of the Fifth District of Saigon" Le Ngoc Chi, the puppet "Harbor Patrol Chief of Saigon" Pham Quoc Chu, and the puppet army officer Nguyen Bao Thuy. Those injured include: the puppet "Mayor of Saigon" Nguyen Van Thieu, the puppet "Deputy Commander of the Capital Military Region" Nguyen Van Thieu, and the puppet "Deputy Police Commissioner" Tran Van Dung, as well as another puppet official.

	The incident of the master killing his own running dogs is not uncommon in South Vietnam. This time, due to the severity of the incident, the master initially refused to take responsibility. On June 3, the U.S. embassy in Saigon, in a vague statement, had to admit that it was "likely" the work of a U.S. helicopter.

    主子丧魂失魄　走狗挨炸丢命
    美机在惊慌中发射火箭炸死炸伤一批南越伪高级官员
    新华社四日讯　西贡消息：在英勇的越南南方人民解放武装力量的沉重打击下，美伪集团惶惶不可终日。二日，一架美国直升飞机在惊慌中发射的火箭，竟击中西贡市内伪军的一个指挥所，炸死、炸伤伪高级军政官员十名。
    据西方通讯社报道，被炸死的有：伪“西贡市警察局长”阮文澜、伪“陆军第五别动队队长”陶百福、伪“西贡警察局行政长官”阮玉星、伪“西贡第五街区司令”黎玉志、伪“西贡港口巡逻主任”傅国柱和伪陆军军官阮宝水。被炸伤的有：伪“西贡市市长”万文距、伪“首都军区副司令”阮文鉴和伪“警察副总监”陈文奋及另外一个伪官员。
    主子炸死走狗的事，在南越是经常发生的。这一次由于事件严重，起初主子不肯认帐，到了三日，美国驻西贡“大使馆”在它发表的声明中才不得不含糊其词地承认“很可能”是美国直升飞机干的。
