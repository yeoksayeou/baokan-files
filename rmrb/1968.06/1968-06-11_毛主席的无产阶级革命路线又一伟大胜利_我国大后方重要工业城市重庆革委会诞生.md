	In the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, and amidst the triumphant songs of the billion military and civilian people across the nation seizing a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Revolutionary Committee of Chongqing City, Sichuan Province, has been gloriously born. This is another great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and another great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

	Chongqing is an important industrial city in the great socialist motherland's rear, and a transportation hub in Southwest China. Before liberation, Chongqing was the center of the anti-revolutionary rule of the American-Chiang bandits. After liberation, the broad revolutionary people, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, have made great contributions in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. However, the traitors, spies, and unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in Chongqing, represented by the likes of Li Pingyuan, Liao Zhigao, Ren Baige, and Huang Xinting, who are the agents of the great revisionist traitor China Khrushchev in the Southwest region, Sichuan Province, and Chongqing City, have colluded with the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, desperately opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, promoting a counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and attempting to restore capitalism. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad revolutionary masses in the Chongqing region, following the victorious course charted by the great leader Chairman Mao, have hoisted high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and engaged in fierce struggles and repeated confrontations with the traitors, spies, and unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, as well as the great revisionist traitor China Khrushchev and his agents in the Southwest, Sichuan, and Chongqing. The broad proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses have resolutely defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, resolutely opposed right-opportunism, right-capitulationism, and right-splittism, united as one, and jointly defeated the class enemies' attempts to reverse the verdict, seizing decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Chongqing City.

	Currently, the situation in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Chongqing region is excellent and getting better. The city has held over 30,000 sessions of various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with over 2 million participants. The great Mao Zedong Thought has been unprecedentedly popularized, and the revolutionary people's consciousness of class struggle and line struggle has been unprecedentedly heightened. The great leader Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin have made a series of wise decisions on the issues of Sichuan and Chongqing, which are being further implemented. The broad revolutionary people across the city are seizing the revolution and promoting production, and the industrial and agricultural fronts are presenting a new situation.

	The broad officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Chongqing have actively responded to the great call of the great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao, "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses," and have done a great deal of work and achieved remarkable results in the "three supports, two militaries" work, in defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and in consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat.

	On June 2, the military and civilian people of Chongqing held a grand rally at Datianwan to celebrate the establishment of the Chongqing City Revolutionary Committee. Nearly 300,000 revolutionary masses and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army participated in the meeting, enthusiastically shouting "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!" "Long live the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

	Comrade Lan Yinan, the head of the Chongqing City Revolutionary Committee, spoke at the celebration rally. He said that after the establishment of the revolutionary committee, we must continue to seize class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. We must see that a handful of class enemies will try to reverse the verdict at any opportunity. The rightist reversal of verdicts and the struggle against rightist reversal of verdicts are an important manifestation of the struggle between the restoration of capitalism by the bourgeoisie and the prevention of restoration by the proletariat. The rightist reversal of verdicts has occurred in the past, is occurring now, and will occur in the future. We must firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, carry out a sustained and in-depth revolutionary criticism, strengthen the awareness of the enemy situation, seriously clean up the class ranks, carry out the struggle against the enemy, and firmly, accurately, and ruthlessly strike at a handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and other open and hidden counter-revolutionaries, further consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must criticize reactionary thoughts from the right and the ultra-left, resolutely oppose right-opportunism, right-capitulationism, and right-splittism, and thoroughly smash the rightist reversal of verdicts. The proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad revolutionary masses must, on the principle basis of Mao Zedong Thought, consolidate and develop the great alliance of revolution and the three-in-one combination, unite as one, and jointly struggle against the enemy.

	Comrade Lan Yinan said that Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." We must seriously study and implement Chairman Mao's latest instruction, always believe in the masses in our work, rely on the broad masses of the people, respect the masses' pioneering spirit, and fully mobilize the masses' revolutionary enthusiasm. The revolutionary committee must place the active learning and application of Mao Zedong Thought at the forefront of all work, and regard the learning, execution, propaganda, and defense of Chairman Mao's instructions as our sacred duty, striving to build the revolutionary committee into a strong revolutionary command headquarters that is closely connected with the masses.

	Comrade Lan Yinan said that the broad revolutionary people across the city must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great strategic directives of "seizing the revolution, promoting production, promoting work, and promoting preparedness" and "frugality in revolution," resolutely smash the class enemies' evil plots to sabotage production, and make industrial and agricultural production and all aspects of work even better, seizing double victories in revolution and production.

	Comrades Li Dachang, Liang Xingchu, and Zhang Xiting, responsible comrades of the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the Chengdu Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, attended the celebration rally and spoke.

	Responsible comrades of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Chongqing, deputy heads and committee members of the Chongqing City Revolutionary Committee, attended the meeting. Comrade Wei Tongtai, a responsible comrade of the Chongqing Garrison Command, spoke on behalf of the officers and soldiers stationed in Chongqing. Deputy heads of the revolutionary committee, Comrades Lu Dading, Huang Lian, and Xiong Daifu, and representatives of revolutionary mass organizations, also spoke at the meeting.

	Amidst thunderous applause, the meeting passed a telegram of respect to the most beloved great leader Chairman Mao.

    毛主席的无产阶级革命路线又一伟大胜利
    我国大后方重要工业城市重庆革委会诞生
    三十万军民集会庆祝，高呼“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”他们决心继续狠抓阶级斗争，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，持久深入开展革命大批判，认真清理阶级队伍，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人。坚决批判来自右的或极“左”方面的反动思想，巩固和发展革命大联合和革命三结合，誓夺文化大革命全面胜利
    新华社重庆十日电　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，在全国亿万军民夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，四川省重庆市革命委员会光荣诞生了。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的又一伟大胜利。
    重庆是伟大社会主义祖国大后方的重要工业城市，是大西南的交通枢纽。解放前，重庆曾经是美蒋匪帮反革命统治的中心。解放后，广大革命人民在毛主席无产阶级革命路线指引下，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中作出了很大贡献。但是，中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派在西南地区、四川省和重庆市的代理人李井泉、廖志高、任白戈、黄新廷之流，代表国民党反动派的利益，代表帝国主义、资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的利益，在重庆招降纳叛，结党营私，搜罗国民党反动派的残渣余孽，竭力对抗毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，推行反革命修正主义路线，妄图复辟资本主义。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，重庆地区无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，沿着伟大领袖毛主席指引的胜利航向，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派以及他们在西南、四川和重庆的代理人，同叛徒、特务和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子等一小撮阶级敌人，进行了激烈的搏斗和反复较量。广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众坚决保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，坚决反对右倾机会主义、右倾投降主义、右倾分裂主义，团结一致，共同对敌，一次又一次粉碎了阶级敌人刮起的右倾翻案妖风，夺得了重庆市无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。
    当前，重庆地区无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，越来越好。全市各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班办了三万多期，参加学习的有二百多万人次。伟大的毛泽东思想空前普及，革命人民的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟空前提高。伟大领袖毛主席和以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部对四川、重庆问题的一系列英明决策，正在进一步深入贯彻执行。全市广大革命人民抓革命、促生产，工农业战线出现一派新气象。
    中国人民解放军驻重庆部队广大指战员，积极响应伟大统帅毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召，在“三支”“两军”工作中，在保卫无产阶级文化大革命，巩固无产阶级专政的斗争中，做了大量的工作，取得了显著成绩，立了新功。
    六月二日，重庆市军民在大田湾举行盛大集会，热烈庆祝重庆市革命委员会成立。参加大会的广大革命群众和人民解放军指战员近三十万人，千遍万遍地热烈高呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想胜利万岁！”“毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！”“伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党万岁！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    重庆市革命委员会主任兰亦农同志在庆祝大会上讲了话。他说，革命委员会成立后，要继续狠抓阶级斗争，狠抓两条路线的斗争。我们必须看到，一小撮阶级敌人一有机会就要搞翻案。右倾翻案和反右倾翻案，是资产阶级复辟和无产阶级反复辟斗争的一个重要表现。右倾翻案风过去有，现在有，将来还会有。我们要牢牢掌握斗争大方向，持久而深入地开展革命大批判。要加强敌情观念，认真清理阶级队伍，开展对敌斗争，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派以及其他公开的、暗藏的反革命分子，进一步巩固无产阶级专政。要批判来自右的和极“左”方面的反动思想，坚决反对右倾机会主义、右倾投降主义、右倾分裂主义，彻底粉碎右倾翻案风。无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，要在毛泽东思想的原则基础上，巩固和发展革命大联合和革命三结合，团结起来，共同对敌。
    兰亦农同志说，毛主席最近教导我们：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”我们要认真学习和落实毛主席的这一最新指示，在自己的工作中永远相信群众，依靠广大人民群众，尊重群众的首创精神，充分发挥群众的革命积极性。革命委员会要把活学活用毛泽东思想放在一切工作的首位，把学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛主席指示当作自己的神圣职责，努力把革命委员会建设成为密切联系群众的坚强的革命战斗指挥部。
    兰亦农同志说，全市广大革命人民要坚决贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”、“要节约闹革命”的伟大战略方针，坚决粉碎阶级敌人破坏生产的罪恶阴谋，把工农业生产和各方面的工作搞得更好，夺取革命、生产双胜利。
    四川省革命委员会、中国人民解放军成都军区负责同志李大章、梁兴初、张西挺出席了庆祝大会，并讲了话。
    中国人民解放军驻重庆部队负责同志、重庆市革命委员会副主任和委员，出席了大会。重庆警备区负责同志韦统泰代表驻重庆部队指战员在会上讲了话。市革命委员会副主任鲁大东、黄廉、熊代富同志和革命群众组织代表，也在会上讲了话。
    在雷鸣般的掌声中，大会通过了给最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的致敬电。
