The Saigon puppet regime is intensifying the recruitment of cannon fodder to support the U.S. imperialists' expansion of the war in Vietnam. The head of this regime, the puppet president Nguyen Van Thieu, announced on the 19th a so-called "general mobilization" decree. According to this decree, all males aged 17 to 43 in the areas occupied by the U.S. and the Saigon puppets will be forcibly conscripted into the army to serve as cannon fodder, aiming to increase the puppet army by over 260,000 troops.

    南越傀儡集团加紧搜罗炮灰
    南越傀儡集团正在加紧搜罗炮灰，以配合美帝国主义扩大侵越战争。这个集团的头目、伪总统阮文绍十九日宣布了一项所谓“总动员”的法案。根据这项法案，将把南越美伪占领地区的所有十七岁到四十三岁的男子都强征入伍充当炮灰，以便把伪军增加二十六万多人。
