Over the past month, the great storm of the French revolutionary mass movement has swept across the entire country. The scale of this movement, its ferocity, its rapid development, the intensity and duration of the struggle, as well as the increasingly close union of the student movement, the worker movement, and the peasant movement, are unprecedented in French history over the past few decades.

The great storm has fiercely assaulted the reactionary rule of the French monopolistic bourgeoisie, shaking the decaying and collapsing world capitalist system to its core.

The great storm has fully demonstrated that the French proletariat, once praised by Marx as possessing "historical initiative" and "determined to rise up," has once again written a brilliant page in French history. They are truly the worthy descendants of the Paris Commune.

In the midst of the great storm, two fundamental standpoints, two paths, and two lines of struggle have clashed fiercely: one represented by the French revolutionary Marxist-Leninists, and the other by the treacherous French Communist Party (FCP) modern revisionist clique.

The French Marxist-Leninist Communist Party and all Marxist-Leninists stand on the side of the revolutionary people. They enthusiastically praise and support the great achievements of the revolutionary people and bravely join the revolutionary people in the struggle.

The French revisionist leadership, however, stands on the opposite side of the movement. They have done everything in their power to slander, attack, provoke, sabotage, and betray the great mass revolutionary struggle. They have played the role of the despicable lackeys of the monopolistic bourgeoisie.

Look at their performances:

Just as the flames of the French mass revolutionary struggle were igniting in early May from the Nanterre and Paris student districts, the heads of the French revisionists hurriedly jumped out, creating counter-revolutionary public opinion and collaborating with the French ruling clique to suppress the student movement. They bared their fangs, viciously insulting the students who dared to rebel against the bourgeois system as "pseudo-revolutionaries" and "provocateurs," and slandering the students' revolutionary actions as "riots" and "political adventurism." They acted as defenders of the reactionary authorities, even blaming the beatings and arrests of thousands of students by the police on the "riots" and "political adventurism."

As the student movement moved towards uniting with the worker movement, the heads of the French revisionists were terrified and enraged. They tried to sabotage the fighting unity between workers and students, splitting the revolutionary mass movement. They obstructed students from going to the factory districts to make revolutionary connections, opposed students supporting workers' strikes, and even ordered members of the French General Confederation of Labor, which they controlled, not to participate in student assemblies and marches.

As the worker masses broke through the barriers set by the heads of the French revisionists and launched a nationwide wave of strikes, factory occupations, and detentions of capitalists, directing the struggle directly at the capitalist system, the heads of the French revisionists used every means to suppress the political struggle of the masses, trying to limit the movement to purely economic demands. They shouted about "opposing all attempts to divert attention from the nature of the rights demands" and the French General Confederation of Labor ordered that factories could only be occupied "without any conflict," and that the occupying workers should release the detained capitalists.

As more than ten million French workers persisted in their strikes, paralyzing the national economy and burning the monopolistic bourgeoisie to the point of desperation, the heads of the French revisionists eagerly proposed conditions for resuming work, accepted the French government's suggestion to participate in the "three-way talks" with the government, employers, and yellow unions, and peddled the "resumption of work agreement" everywhere, attempting to bribe workers back to work with a few more francs. The eagerness of these lackeys to quickly extinguish the revolutionary flames was even more urgent than that of their masters.

As the revolutionary mass movement continued to develop and the national political crisis deepened, the heads of the French revisionists hastened to collude with the pro-American Social Democratic Left Alliance, actively patching together the so-called "democratic alliance people's government" to open the road to socialism, attempting to help the monopolistic bourgeoisie transfer the state machine from one hand to another and thereby obtain some rewards from the monopolistic bourgeoisie. A British bourgeois newspaper praised the heads of the French revisionists as the "natural allies of the French government" in preventing the worker movement from developing into a revolutionary movement. This was indeed not an exaggeration.

The treacherous activities of the French revisionist leadership have received active support and close coordination from the Soviet revisionist leadership. The Soviet revisionists also viciously attacked the French student movement as the "rebellious activities" of "leftists" and "adventurists." They breathed in unison with the French revisionists, loudly proclaiming that the French monopolistic bourgeoisie had made "major concessions" in the "three-way talks," attempting to trick the French working class into abandoning the revolutionary struggle and surrendering to the monopolistic bourgeoisie. The Soviet revisionist leadership also repeatedly applauded the treacherous statements of the French revisionists and the yellow unions. They are birds of a feather.

The Soviet revisionist traitor clique usually boasts about how the proletariat is at the "center of the modern era" and how the working class in developed capitalist countries plays an important role in the anti-imperialist forces. They pretend to be very concerned about the worker movements in Europe. However, when the great storms of worker and student movements in France and other capitalist countries arrived, this group of traitors immediately fled in terror, throwing their "anti-imperialism" and "center of the era" slogans to the winds, and kneeling and begging the workers to maintain "order" and "calm." This fully exposed these frauds as servants of imperialism and capitalism, as counter-revolutionary lackeys serving the imperialists led by the United States.

Forty-eight years ago, Lenin, in analyzing and exposing the Second International Social Democrats, pointed out: "Opportunism is our main enemy. Opportunism in the upper layers of the workers' movement is not proletarian socialism, but bourgeois socialism. It has been proven that maintaining the bourgeoisie through the activities of opportunist leaders from the workers' movement is better than the bourgeoisie doing it themselves. If the workers are not led by them, the bourgeoisie's rule cannot be maintained." Now, in France, it is precisely this group of traitorous labor scabs, this group of new Social Democratic leaders, who are playing the role of the watchdogs of imperialism and the capitalist exploitation system.

The French revisionist leadership has long betrayed the fundamental interests of the working class, serving the monopolistic bourgeoisie at the critical moment of the French reactionary ruling class's severe crisis.

People still remember that at the end of World War II, when France presented a great revolutionary situation, the top leader of the French revisionists, Thorez, in exchange for a vice-premier's hat, handed over the tens of thousands of people's armed forces that the French people had built during the anti-fascist war to the bourgeoisie, burying the victory of the French people's revolutionary cause.

People still remember that when this group of labor scabs received a few crumbs from the capitalists, they called on workers to "produce, produce, and produce again" for the capitalists, and cursed striking workers as "lazybones," even severely punishing Communist Party members who led the strikes, helping the monopolistic bourgeoisie to get through the difficult times.

People also remember that when the French imperialist colonial system collapsed after the war, the French revisionist leadership openly supported the French imperialist policy of national assimilation, vigorously promoting the "French Federation" and "French Community," even participating in the bloody suppression of the Algerian people, serving to maintain the evil system of exploitation and enslavement of the colonial peoples.

After Thorez's death, de Gaulle, in a condolence telegram, bluntly said: "At the decisive moment in France, Thorez responded to my call and, as a member of my government, helped maintain national unity." These few words of condolence are very important, extremely interesting, and highly instructive.

Now, the leaders of the French revisionists, such as Roger, have fully inherited Thorez's legacy, following the Soviet revisionist leadership, and even more fiercely promoting the modern revisionist line of advocating cooperation between the working class and the monopolistic bourgeoisie, canceling class struggle, and betraying the proletarian socialist revolution and proletarian dictatorship, thoroughly betraying the revolutionary cause of France.

However, imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries are paper tigers. The French revisionist leaders' efforts to serve the reactionary rule of the bourgeoisie will absolutely not stop the development of the revolutionary struggle of the French people. Their shameless betrayal has become a negative example for people to recognize how far modern revisionism has fallen.

Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "The people of all countries, more than ninety percent of the total population, are always revolutionary and will always support Marxism-Leninism. They will not support revisionism; some may temporarily support it, but they will eventually abandon it. They will gradually awaken and will always oppose imperialism and the reactionaries of all countries, and will always oppose revisionism." (Speech at the Conference of Seven Thousand People in 1962)

The revolutionary youth students and the working class of France, the broad masses of the French people, need revolution and dare to make revolution. They despise the deeply rooted bourgeois authority, fear not the brutal suppression of the reactionary ruling authorities, and have challenged the French revisionist group. They do not heed the hooligan-style threats of the French revisionist group but publicly expose the traitorous face of the French revisionist group, condemn the betrayal policies and endless tricks of the French revisionist group. They have broken through the layers of control of the French revisionist group in the struggle, and they are rapidly awakening in the struggle.

The revolutionary Marxist-Leninists of France, the French proletariat with a glorious revolutionary tradition, and the broad revolutionary people, with the strong support of the revolutionary people of the world, will definitely kick away all obstacles, run swiftly along the road of their own liberation. No matter how the monopolistic bourgeoisie and the revisionist group struggle desperately, use what tricks, no matter what difficulties and twists the French people will encounter in their future struggles, as our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with people's will. No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the forward march of the wheel of history, revolution will occur sooner or later and will inevitably be victorious."

    老工贼，新叛卖
    ——斥法修叛徒集团
    本报评论员
    一个月来，法国革命群众运动的伟大风暴，席卷了整个法国。这个运动的规模之大，来势之猛，发展之快，斗争之激烈和持久，以及学生运动、工人运动和农民运动之日益紧密的结合，是法国近几十年来所没有的。
    伟大的风暴，猛烈地冲击着法国垄断资产阶级的反动统治，震动了腐朽的没落的世界资本主义制度。
    伟大的风暴，充分地显示了曾经被马克思誉之为“具有历史首创精神”“决意实行冲天”的法国无产阶级，又在法国历史上写下了光辉灿烂的一页。他们不愧为巴黎公社的优秀儿女。
    人们可以看到，在伟大的风暴之中，交织着以法国革命的马克思列宁主义者为代表的、和以叛卖成性的法共现代修正主义集团为代表的两种基本立场、两条道路和两条路线的激烈斗争。
    法国马克思列宁主义共产党和所有马克思列宁主义者，站在革命的人民一边。他们热烈歌颂和支持革命人民的伟大创举，并且果断勇敢地和革命人民一道，共同战斗。
    法国修正主义领导集团，则站在运动的对面。他们对伟大的群众革命斗争，竭尽诽谤、攻击、挑衅、破坏和叛卖的能事。他们地地道道地扮演了垄断资产阶级豢养的下贱走狗的角色。
    请看他们一出出的表演：
    正当五月初，法国群众革命斗争的怒火刚从农泰尔和巴黎学生区燃起的时候，法修头目就急急忙忙地跳了出来，大造反革命舆论，配合法国统治集团镇压学生运动。他们凶相毕露，恶毒地辱骂敢于起来向资产阶级制度造反的学生是“假革命”和“挑衅分子”，诬蔑学生的革命行动是什么“暴乱”和“政治冒险”。他们充当反动当局的辩护士，竟把成百上千学生遭到警察的毒打和逮捕，诬蔑为“暴乱”和“政治冒险”所导致的结果。
    正当学生运动走向同工人运动相结合的时候，法修头目怕得要死，恨得要命。他们力图破坏工人同学生的战斗团结，分裂革命的群众运动。他们阻挠学生到工厂区进行革命串连，反对学生支持工人的罢工斗争，甚至下令禁止他们所控制的法国总工会会员参加学生的集会和游行。
    正当工人群众冲破法修头目所设置的障壁，在全国范围内轰轰烈烈地掀起罢工、占厂、扣留资本家的浪潮，把斗争的锋芒直接指向资本主义制度的时候，法修头目千方百计地遏制群众政治斗争的发展，力图把运动的目的局限于纯经济的权利要求。他们叫嚷什么“应该反对可能歪曲运动的权利要求性质的一切转移视线的企图”。法修总工会还下令只能在“不发生任何冲突的情况下”占领工厂，并要占厂工人释放被扣留的资本家。
    正当法国一千多万工人群众坚持罢工，使法国全国经济陷于瘫痪，垄断资产阶级被群众斗争的烈火烧得焦头烂额的时候，法修头目迫不及待地提出可能复工的条件，欣然接受法国政府的建议，参加政府、资方和黄色工会的“三方谈判”，到处兜售复工“协议”，妄图以增加几个法郎的工资来诱骗工人复工。奴才们那种要尽快扑灭革命火焰的卑鄙心怀，真是比自己的主子更为迫切。
    正当革命群众运动继续往前发展，全国性的政治危机急剧加深的时候，法修头目就加紧同亲美的社会民主左翼联盟勾结，积极拼凑所谓“开辟通向社会主义道路的”“民主联盟人民政府”，力图帮助垄断资产阶级把国家机器从一只手转到另一只手，并借此乞得垄断资产阶级的一些犒赏。一家英国资产阶级报刊夸奖法修头目在设法防止工人运动发展成为一场革命运动方面是“法国政府的天生盟友”。这确实一点也不是过言。
    法修领导集团的叛卖活动，得到苏修领导集团的积极支持和紧密配合。苏联修正主义者咬牙切齿地也恶毒攻击法国学生运动是“左倾分子”、“冒险主义分子”的“叛乱活动”。他们同法修一鼻孔出气，大肆宣扬法国垄断资产阶级在“三方谈判”中作了“重大让步”，诱骗法国工人阶级放弃革命斗争，向垄断资产阶级屈服。苏修领导集团还一再为法修和黄色工会的叛卖性声明极力捧场。他们和法修领导集团是一丘之貉。
    苏修叛徒集团平时不是口口声声地侈谈什么无产阶级“站在现时代的中心”么？不是一天到晚念着“发达的资本主义国家的工人阶级在反帝力量中占有重要地位”么？伪装得好象他们最重视欧洲的工人运动。但是，法国和其他资本主义国家的工人运动和学生运动的大风暴一来临，这伙叛徒就立即吓得魂飞魄散，把什么“反帝”、“时代中心”统统抛到九霄云外，而叩头作揖地哀求工人保持“秩序”和“平静”了。这充分暴露这群骗子手是维护帝国主义、资本主义“秩序”的奴才，是为以美国为首的帝国主义效劳的反革命走狗。
    四十八年前，列宁在分析和揭露第二国际社会民主党时指出：“机会主义是我们的主要敌人。工人运动中的上层分子的机会主义，不是无产阶级的社会主义，而是资产阶级的社会主义。事实证明：由工人运动内部的机会主义派别活动家来维护资产阶级，比资产者亲自出马还好。工人要不是由他们来领导，资产阶级的统治就无法维持了”〔注〕。现在，在法国，正是法修领导集团这一帮叛徒工贼，这一帮新社会民主党头目，起着帝国主义、资本主义剥削制度看家狗的作用。
    法修领导集团出卖工人阶级根本利益，在法国反动统治阶级陷入严重危机的关键时刻为垄断资产阶级效劳，是由来已久的。
    人们当还记得，在第二次世界大战末期，法国出现大好革命形势的时候，法修总头目多列士，为换取一顶副总理的乌纱帽，把法国人民在反法西斯战争中创建起来的几十万人民武装，双手拱奉给资产阶级，葬送了法国人民革命事业的胜利前途。
    人们当还记得，当这批工贼从资本家那里得到一点残羹剩饭的时候，他们就号召工人为资本家“生产、生产、再生产”，并破口大骂罢工工人是“懒汉”，甚至严厉惩罚带头罢工的共产党人，帮助了垄断资产阶级渡过难关。
    人们也还记得，当战后法帝国主义殖民制度分崩离析的时候，法修领导集团公然支持法帝国主义的民族同化政策，大肆宣扬“法兰西联邦”和“法兰西共同体”，甚至参与血腥镇压阿尔及利亚人民的肮脏勾当，为维护剥削和奴役殖民地人民的罪恶制度效劳。
    多列士死后，戴高乐在一份唁电中直言不讳地说：“在法国的决定性时刻，多列士以响应我的号召和作为我的政府的一员，帮助维持了国家的团结”。这短短几句悼言，是非常重要，极其有趣和大有教益的。
    现在，法修头目罗歇之流，全盘承继了多列士的衣钵，紧跟苏修领导集团，变本加厉地推行鼓吹工人阶级同垄断资产阶级合作，取消阶级斗争，背叛无产阶级社会主义革命和无产阶级专政的现代修正主义路线，彻头彻尾地叛卖法国的革命事业。
    但是，帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派，统统都是纸老虎。法修头目如此卖力地为维护资产阶级反动统治效劳，绝对阻挡不了法国人民群众革命斗争的发展。他们无耻的叛卖行径，正好充当了人们认识现代修正主义已经堕落到何种地步的反面教员。
    毛主席早就指出：“各国的人民，占人口总数的百分之九十以上的人民大众，总是要革命的，总是会拥护马克思列宁主义的。他们不会拥护修正主义，有些人暂时拥护，将来终究会抛弃它。他们总会逐步地觉醒起来，总会反对帝国主义和各国的反动派，总会反对修正主义。”（一九六二年在七千人大会上的讲话）
    法国革命的青年学生和工人阶级，法国的广大人民群众，需要革命和敢于革命。他们蔑视根深蒂固的资产阶级权威，不畏反动统治当局的残暴镇压，对法修集团提出了挑战。他们不理睬法修集团的无赖式的恫吓，而是公开揭露法修集团的叛徒面目，谴责法修集团的叛卖政策和层出不穷的骗局。他们在斗争中冲破了法修集团层层控制，他们正在斗争中迅速觉醒起来。
    法国的革命的马克思列宁主义者，具有光荣革命传统的法国无产阶级和广大革命人民，在全世界革命人民的强大支持下，一定会踢开一切绊脚石，沿着自己解放自己的道路迅跑。不管垄断资产阶级和修正主义集团怎样垂死挣扎，施展什么阴谋诡计，不管法国人民在今后的斗争中还会遇到多大的困难和曲折，正如我们的伟大领袖毛主席所指出的：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利”。
