The great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship." This is a universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought that applies everywhere, and it is another great theoretical weapon that Chairman Mao has given to the revolutionary people of the whole world.

Throughout history, all ruling classes have been regimes that suppress the broad masses of the people. The more reactionary they become and the more they face the high tide of the people's revolution, the more they will frantically suppress the broad masses of the people. The tsars were like this, Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo were like this, and Chiang Kai-shek is also like this. The imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries today are still like this, without exception.

The proletarian dictatorship is the first regime in human history that protects the broad masses of the people.

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, aims to consolidate the proletarian dictatorship, prevent the restoration of capitalism, and prevent the regime that protects the broad masses of the people from becoming a regime that suppresses the broad masses of the people.

Whether to protect the people or suppress the people is the dividing line between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev. The essence of the Chinese Khrushchev's reactionary bourgeois line is to "stand on the reactionary bourgeois position, implement bourgeois dictatorship, suppress the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, distort right and wrong, confuse black and white, encircle and suppress the revolutionary factions, suppress dissenting opinions, and implement white terror..." Therefore, we must thoroughly criticize and resolutely reject the reactionary bourgeois line pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev.

All levels of revolutionary committees should consolidate the proletarian dictatorship in the struggle, resolutely suppress the enemies of the proletariat, and resolutely protect the people. We must always believe in and rely on the broad masses of the people, respect the initiative of the masses, and fully mobilize the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, so that we can become revolutionary, authoritative, closely linked with the masses, and vigorous power organs of the proletariat.

### 对人民坚决保护  对敌人实行专政

专栏：各地报纸评论摘要

    对人民坚决保护  对敌人实行专政
    伟大领袖毛主席最近指示我们：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”这是放之四海而皆准的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的普遍真理，是毛主席给予全世界革命人民的又一伟大的理论武器。
    历史上一切剥削阶级的政权，都是镇压广大人民群众的政权。它们越是走向反动，越是面临人民革命的高潮，就越是疯狂地镇压广大人民群众。当年的沙皇是这样，希特勒、墨索里尼、东条英机是这样，蒋介石也是这样。现在的帝国主义、现代修正主义、各国反动派还是这样，无一例外。
    无产阶级政权是人类历史上第一个保护广大人民群众的政权。
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，就是为的巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，防止保护广大人民群众的政权变为镇压广大人民群众的政权。
    保护人民，还是镇压人民，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线同中国赫鲁晓夫资产阶级反动路线的分水岭。中国赫鲁晓夫资产阶级反动路线的实质，就是“站在反动的资产阶级立场上，实行资产阶级专政，将无产阶级轰轰烈烈的文化大革命运动打下去，颠倒是非，混淆黑白，围剿革命派，压制不同意见，实行白色恐怖……”。因此，我们对中国赫鲁晓夫推行的资产阶级反动路线应该彻底批判，坚决摈弃。
    各级革命委员会应该在斗争中巩固无产阶级专政，对无产阶级的敌人坚决镇压，对人民群众坚决保护。要永远相信和依靠广大人民群众，尊重群众的首创精神，充分发挥群众的革命积极性，使自己成为革命的、有无产阶级权威的、密切联系群众的、朝气蓬勃的权力机构。
