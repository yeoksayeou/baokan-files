The Revolutionary Committee of Red One Mine in Datong, following Chairman Mao's instructions to immerse oneself among the masses, moved the frontline command post for focusing on revolution and promoting production from the four-story building above the mine to the coal mining face below. This allowed the committee members to closely connect with the masses on the production frontline, intensify class struggle, and promote coal production.

After moving the frontline command post to the underground, the revolution and production in the mine showed a great improvement in just one month. The revolutionary criticism deepened, Mao Zedong Thought became more widespread, and the rightist reversal wind was smashed. Hidden traitors, spies, and landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists were exposed. As the revolution deepened, production improved. The average daily output in May increased by 46% compared to April, setting two new records for the highest daily output since 1960. The entire mine completed its May production tasks ahead of schedule and above target.

Originally, the frontline command post for focusing on revolution and promoting production was located above the mine. They understood the problems below the mine in the same old way: by looking at instruments, listening to reports, and taking calls. Problems that underground workers and staff wanted to be solved could not be promptly reflected to the Revolutionary Committee. The committee could not promptly grasp the new developments, characteristics, and situations of class struggle on the production frontline, nor could it promptly solve new problems in class struggle. The main members of the Revolutionary Committee and the PLA support team discovered this issue and believed that the biggest weakness of the frontline command post being above the mine was that the committee was not convenient for connecting with the majority of the workers, which could easily lead to bureaucratic tendencies and complacency among the leaders. It could neither effectively command class struggle nor solve production problems. After discussion, the committee decided to move the frontline command post from above the mine to below.

The news that the Revolutionary Committee would move the frontline command post to the underground quickly spread throughout the mine area and was enthusiastically supported by the revolutionary staff and workers. However, a small group of class enemies and stubborn capitalist-roaders were terrified and enraged by the committee's revolutionary action. They crawled out from the gutters to launch a frenzied counterattack, spreading rumors and slanders, saying things like "the command post moving underground to focus on production means the committee's direction is wrong," attempting to stir up conflicts between the workers and the committee. The committee, in response to the class enemies' counterattack, mobilized the revolutionary staff and workers to deeply criticize the revisionist line of managing enterprises pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the mine area. The workers, with a wealth of facts, exposed the enemies' plots, which aimed to make revolutionary leaders detached from reality and the masses, hoping to weaken our newly born Revolutionary Committee and allow them to carry out counter-revolutionary conspiracies. Chairman Mao taught us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." We must use actual actions to smash the enemies' plots and truly build the frontline command post into a combat command post that both focuses on revolution and commands production.

After moving the frontline command post to the underground, the committee members, as ordinary laborers, studied, worked, and fought alongside the workers. They intensified class struggle in the production struggle, and through intensifying class struggle, further promoted production.

Last year, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great policy of "focusing on revolution and promoting production," the mining and excavation team of this mine completed its annual production plan 45 days ahead of schedule, and this year, they completed the first quarter's production plan 25 days ahead of schedule, becoming an advanced unit in the entire mine. However, since April, the team's production has not improved. Some people thought this was due to workers not properly adhering to the production responsibility system or production coordination issues. The committee members, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," used class analysis methods to investigate and study with the team's cadres, helping everyone realize that the root of the problem was class enemies conducting sabotage activities in the team. They mobilized revolutionary workers to expose, criticize, and fight against the bad elements hidden in the revolutionary ranks, finally exposing them. The workers said: To do well in production, we must first do well in class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. If we prioritize production over revolution, the great achievements of the Cultural Revolution may be lost. "Class struggle, once grasped, works wonders." Since May, despite having fewer people and worse conditions, they still overfulfilled the production plan. The changes in the mining and excavation team made the committee members deeply realize that closely connecting with the masses and intensifying class struggle with the broad masses can promote the development of coal production.

After arriving at the production frontline, the committee members realized that only by immersing themselves among the masses could they discover problems, and only by immersing themselves among the masses could they solve problems. In the past, under the influence of the so-called "standardization" and "modernization" of managing enterprises pushed by a small group of capitalist-roaders within the party, the mine's mechanical and electrical maintenance station was always set up above the mine. When machines below the mine malfunctioned, workers often had to spend a long time running to the surface to find maintenance workers, which not only delayed production but also affected the unity among workers, even giving class enemies opportunities to sabotage production. After moving the frontline command post to the underground, they broke the "standardization" foreign framework and moved the mechanical and electrical maintenance station from above the mine to below, promptly discovering and solving problems.

After moving the frontline command post from the four-story building to the underground, it brought along all the service industries in the entire mine, truly achieving "everything for the victory of the frontline," establishing a revolutionary style and a system of serving the frontline, and effectively promoting coal production.

The committee members, along with the frontline command post, moved to the underground and underwent new tests in the waves of class struggle. They fought in the most acute and complex places of class struggle and worked and labored in the most arduous and dangerous places of production struggle, strengthening their class struggle consciousness, raising their awareness of the struggle between the two lines, effectively promoting the thought revolution of the committee members, strengthening the relationship between the leaders and the masses, improving work styles, and consolidating the newly born Revolutionary Committee.

    大同红一矿革委会抓革命促生产第一线指挥部
    从井上搬到井下密切干群关系和工人并肩战斗促进煤炭生产
    新华社太原电　大同煤矿红一矿革命委员会遵照毛主席关于深入于群众之中的教导，把抓革命促生产第一线指挥部从井上四层楼搬到井下采煤作业面附近。这样，革委会成员在生产第一线上密切联系群众，狠抓阶级斗争，推动了煤炭生产。
    红一矿革命委员会把抓革命促生产第一线指挥部搬到井下后，只一个月，井下的革命和生产，就呈现出一派大好形势。革命大批判步步深入，毛泽东思想日益普及；粉碎了阶级敌人右倾翻案妖风，揪出了隐藏的叛徒、特务和地、富、反、坏、右分子。革命深入发展，生产越来越好。五月份的平均日产量比四月份提高了百分之四十六，曾两次创造了一九六○年以来日产量最高水平，全矿提前超额完成了五月份生产任务。
    红一矿抓革命促生产第一线指挥部原来设在矿井上面办公。他们了解矿井下面的问题，还是和过去一样，靠看仪表，听汇报，接电话。井下干部、工人要求解决的问题，不能及时反映到革命委员会。革委会也不能及时掌握生产第一线上的阶级斗争新动向、新特点和新情况，不能及时解决阶级斗争中的新问题。革委会主要成员和解放军支左人员，发现这个问题后，认为抓革命促生产第一线指挥部设在井上，最大的弱点是革委会不便于联系大多数工人群众，容易使领导成员产生官僚主义的作风，滋长和平麻痹思想；它既不能有力地指挥阶级斗争，又不利于解决生产中的问题。经过革委会讨论，决定把抓革命促生产第一线指挥部从井上搬到井下。
    革命委员会要把抓革命促生产第一线指挥部搬到井下的消息，很快传遍了矿区，立即受到广大革命职工的热烈拥护。但是一小撮阶级敌人和顽固不化的走资派，对革委会这一革命行动怕得要死，恨得要命，他们从阴沟里爬出来进行疯狂反扑，造谣诬蔑，说什么“指挥部下井抓生产，革委会的大方向错了”，妄图挑起工人和革委会的矛盾。革委会针对阶级敌人的反扑，发动广大革命职工对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在矿区的代理人推行的修正主义办企业路线展开深入的批判。工人们以大量事实，揭露阶级敌人的阴谋，是要让革命领导干部脱离实际，脱离群众，妄想使我们新生的革命委员会失去战斗力，好让他们进行反革命的阴谋活动。毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”我们就是要用实际行动粉碎阶级敌人这一阴谋，把抓革命促生产第一线指挥部真正建设成为既抓革命又指挥生产的战斗指挥部。
    抓革命促生产第一线指挥部搬到井下以后，革委会成员就以普通劳动者的身份，和工人同学习、同劳动、同战斗。他们在生产斗争中狠抓阶级斗争，通过狠抓阶级斗争，进一步推动了生产。
    这个矿的采掘队，在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的指引下，去年曾提前四十五天完成全年生产计划，今年又提前二十五天完成了第一季度的生产计划，成为全矿的先进单位。但是进入四月份以来，这个队生产一直上不去。有人认为这是工人没有很好地坚持生产责任制，是生产上不协调造成的。革委会成员遵循毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，用阶级分析的方法，同这个队的干部一起调查研究，使大家认识到，问题的根子是阶级敌人在队里进行破坏活动。他们发动革命职工大揭发、大批判、大斗争，终于把隐藏在革命队伍中的坏分子揪了出来。工人们说：要搞好生产，首先要搞好阶级斗争和两条路线斗争。如果重生产，轻革命，我们无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成果，就有丧失的危险。“阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”五月份以来，他们在人员少、条件差的情况下，仍然超额完成了生产计划。采掘队的前后变化，使革委会成员深深体会到：密切联系群众，和广大群众一起狠抓阶级斗争，就可以促进煤炭生产的发展。
    革委会成员到了生产第一线以后，体会到只有深入群众，才能发现问题，只有深入群众，才能解决问题。过去，在党内一小撮走资派推行的所谓办企业要“正规化”、“现代化”的影响下，矿区的机电维修站历来就设在井上，井下机器发生了故障，工人往往要花很长时间跑到井上，到处找机修工，既耽误了生产，又影响了工人之间的团结，甚至给阶级敌人造成破坏生产的空子。抓革命促生产第一线指挥部搬到井下后，就打破了“正规化”的洋框框，把机电维修站从井上也搬到井下，随时发现问题，随时解决问题。
    抓革命促生产第一线指挥部从四层楼上搬到井下后，带动了全矿所有的服务行业，真正做到了“一切为了前线的胜利”，建立起革命的作风和为第一线服务的制度，有力地促进了煤炭生产。
    革命委员会成员随着抓革命促生产第一线指挥部到井下后，在阶级斗争的风浪里，又经受了新的考验。他们到阶级斗争最尖锐、最复杂的地方去战斗；到生产斗争最艰苦、最危险的地方去工作去劳动，增强了阶级斗争观念，提高了两条路线斗争觉悟，有力地促进了革委会成员的思想革命化，密切了干群关系，改进了工作作风，巩固了新生的革命委员会。
