In the new situation of striving for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, how can rural commune and brigade leadership teams, who have undergone the test of the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, use Mao Zedong Thought to continuously improve their leadership style and further realize revolutionization? The leadership team of Xujia Garden Brigade in Luowenzhao Commune, Yanggao County, Shanxi Province, has gained some experience in this regard.

**Insist on Mao Zedong Thought as the Banner, and Place the Emphasis on Proletarian Politics in All Work**

The leadership team of Xujia Garden Brigade, through revolutionary criticism and struggle, thoroughly criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev and his agents, and seriously studied the great teachings of Chairman Mao: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." They adopted the methods of inviting in and sending out to learn extensively from the political work experience of the PLA. During the process of learning from the PLA, the members of the brigade leadership team deeply realized: The PLA has such high prestige among the people because they are loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They hold the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought high and emphasize proletarian politics well. The brigade leadership team must also follow the path of the PLA, be loyal to Chairman Mao, follow Chairman Mao closely, insist on Mao Zedong Thought as the banner, and place the emphasis on proletarian politics in all work.

Vice Chairman Lin instructed us: "The attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is a very important issue. We must grasp the issue of attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought." The leadership team of Xujia Garden Brigade, through practical struggle, deeply realized: The attitude towards Chairman Mao is the dividing line between revolution and counter-revolution. Loyalty to Chairman Mao means having deep proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao; it means having unwavering faith in Mao Zedong Thought, carrying out every instruction from Chairman Mao without the slightest deviation, and following Chairman Mao's strategic deployments closely. Therefore, whenever instructions from Chairman Mao are transmitted through documents, broadcasts, or newspapers, they act with a combat posture, high political sensitivity, and swift execution. Last year, when important instructions from Chairman Mao during his inspection of North China, Central China, and East China were transmitted, the brigade leadership team immediately disseminated them widely, mobilized cadres and the masses to study them seriously, deeply understand them, widely propagate them, and carry them out resolutely. When the people of the whole country launched a vigorous revolutionary criticism, the leadership team of this brigade took the lead in joining this heated class struggle. They led the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to wage a "people's war," linking the current class struggle and central tasks in the brigade with the struggle against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, launching a great criticism and struggle. Through revolutionary criticism, the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of cadres and commune members were greatly enhanced, their hatred for China's Khrushchev deepened, and their deep proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao were further strengthened. To carry out Chairman Mao's instructions on "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" and setting up study classes, the brigade leadership team immediately sent people to learn from the PLA's experience. Upon returning, they mobilized the masses to set up various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes totaling 270, pushing the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the entire brigade to a new stage. Cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants overcame difficulties such as low cultural level and busy farm work, actively studied and applied the "Three Constantly Read Articles," using "completely" and "thoroughly" as the standard, and taking Zhang Side, Bai Qiu'en, and the Old Man Moving Mountains as examples, sparking a revolution in their souls, breaking private interests and establishing public interests, and promoting the revolutionization of their thoughts. Chairman Mao pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China led by the proletariat and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." When Chairman Mao's latest instructions were transmitted, the brigade leadership team, in conjunction with setting up study classes, mobilized the poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members to conduct a more in-depth revolutionary criticism, taking the initiative to launch a fierce attack on class enemies, seizing the living facts of class struggle in the village where class enemies attempted to disintegrate the collective economy, organizing the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to conduct criticism and struggle, and further enhancing the class struggle consciousness of the poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members.

The members of the Xujia Garden Brigade leadership team took studying, propagating, executing, and defending Mao Zedong Thought as their most important task. The result of seriously emphasizing proletarian politics was that they gained the trust, support, and approval of the broad masses, and the proletarian revolutionary authority was gradually established. Revolutionary struggle practice made them deeply feel: True proletarian revolutionary authority comes from Chairman Mao, from Mao Zedong Thought, and from Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The masses trust, support, and approve of the leadership team because the leadership team acts according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Therefore, the more loyal the leadership team is to Chairman Mao and the closer they follow Chairman Mao, the higher the proletarian revolutionary authority will be.

**Be the Leader, Confidant, and Student of the Masses**

After the prestige of the brigade leadership team gradually increased among the masses, some comrades developed a sense of complacency, speaking in a harsher tone and less frequently going among the masses. The masses quickly noticed these comrades' problems and offered them criticisms. However, some comrades could not accept this, feeling that the masses were "disobedient" and "difficult to manage." This matter immediately attracted the high attention of the brigade leadership team.

How to handle the relationship between cadres and the masses? With the help of comrades from the PLA, the brigade leadership team seriously studied Chairman Mao's great teachings on the mass line and carried out the struggle against selfishness and revisionism. Chairman Mao taught: "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and ignorant, not understanding this point, we cannot gain even the most basic knowledge." "We have always advocated that revolution relies on the masses, everyone participates, and opposed relying only on a few people to issue orders." Through study, combined with criticizing China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, everyone realized: The members of the leadership team are representatives produced by the masses. To truly become the confidants of the masses and serve the masses well, one must be willing to be a student of the masses, listen to the opinions of the masses, insist on the mass line, and never adopt an attitude of "I say so." The cadres of the production brigade have only the obligation to educate the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, not the right to "manage" the masses with their own "position"; they have only the obligation to inspire the masses to follow Chairman Mao's words, not the right to force the masses to absolutely obey them; cadres and commune members, whoever's opinion aligns with Mao Zedong Thought, should act according to that opinion. This is how cadres and commune members together follow Chairman Mao's words. For cadres, opinions from the masses, whether positive or negative, should all be humbly accepted and treated seriously. Reasonable opinions should be enthusiastically accepted. From then on, they demanded more of themselves, further established the mass perspective, insisted on the leadership method of "from the masses, to the masses," and widely solicited opinions from all sides. They promptly handled and resolved the legitimate demands of the masses, making everyone dare to speak and dare to manage affairs. Within the brigade leadership team, they advocated a spirit of everyone daring to take responsibility actively. If something went wrong, everyone took the initiative to assume responsibility and never shifted blame. When work achieved results, everyone first attributed it to the great leader Chairman Mao, and they themselves remained humble and cautious, avoiding arrogance and impatience.

To maintain close ties with the masses, the brigade leadership team always demanded of themselves to be diligent with their hands, feet, and mouths. They participated in collective labor, each being a skilled worker, not asking about the lightness or heaviness of the work, not caring about the good or bad weather, not calculating the amount of pay, and working together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, sweating together, and not asking for high work points during evaluation. Usually, they followed Chairman Mao's teachings: "Solve the problems of the masses' clothing, food, housing, fuel, oil, salt, sickness and health, marriage. In short, all the practical problems of the masses' lives are problems we should pay attention to," and often visited the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants to inquire about their well-being, solicit opinions, and understand their difficulties through their own experiences. They treated solving the political and living problems of the masses as an important task. For whoever in the poor and lower-middle peasants went out of the village, they would draw water for their families; for whoever had something to do, they would help out. For those who were deceived by class enemies during the Cultural Revolution and had once opposed them, they treated them equally and gave them enthusiastic help and care. Commune member Zhang Wanrong, in the early stages of the movement, was deceived by bad elements and had serious opposition to the brigade leadership team. However, the members of the brigade leadership team always treated him as a class brother, not only forgiving him but also helping and uniting with him politically, and caring for him in various ways. Last year, when his wife had a baby and fell seriously ill, four main cadres of the brigade either stayed up all night to call for a doctor and buy medicine, or stayed up all night to take care of the patient, working all night to ensure the patient's safety. Zhang Wanrong was deeply moved.

Because the brigade leadership team insisted on acting according to Chairman Mao's teachings of "wholeheartedly serving the people and never leaving the masses," they deeply rooted themselves among the masses, always maintaining the style of poor and lower-middle peasants. The masses also regarded them as their representatives and one of their own, always being close to them, supporting them, and cherishing them. They firmly followed their correct leadership and sincerely helped with their shortcomings and mistakes in work, ensuring that the cadres and masses were closely united, steps in sync, and the implementation of Chairman Mao's various instructions had a reliable guarantee. The masses praised: "Our cadres are leaders in implementing Chairman Mao's instructions, diligent workers in labor, and confidants in dealing with us. They are good servants of us, the poor and lower-middle peasants." They regarded themselves as a force in the revolution and also as an object of the revolution, being old yellow oxen for the people for life.

**Regard Oneself as a Force in the Revolution and an Object of the Revolution, Be an Old Yellow Ox for the People for Life**

The leadership team of Xujia Garden Brigade realized in the struggle that to lead the poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members to advance along the revolutionary path opened by Chairman Mao, cadres must take the lead. How cadres take steps and choose paths should all set an example for the masses. Therefore, in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes and in daily work, they always took the lead in struggling against selfishness and revisionism, regarding themselves as a force in the revolution while also regarding themselves as an object of the revolution.

Vice Secretary of the Brigade Party Committee, Xu You, came from a poor peasant family and suffered oppression and exploitation in the old society. For a period, he had selfish thoughts, always feeling that being a cadre was "hard work and no reward." The brigade leadership team believed that Xu You's thoughts raised a very important issue for everyone: What is the purpose of being a cadre? For revolution or for personal gain? If this issue is not resolved, the proletarian revolutionary authority of the leadership team cannot be established, and even if it is established, it cannot be consolidated. To resolve this issue, with the help of comrades from the PLA, they repeatedly studied the brilliant "Three Constantly Read Articles." Chairman Mao taught us: "Our Communist Party and the Communist Party-led Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army are revolutionary armies. Our army is completely for the liberation of the people and works thoroughly for the people's interests." Comparing with Chairman Mao's teachings and their own thoughts, they seriously thought, the PLA, marching south and north, enduring wind and snow, did not have anyone record their work points; revolutionary martyrs, sacrificing their heads and shedding blood, rushing into fire and water, did not consider personal gains; Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Li Wenzhong, and Meng He, in the second before their sacrifice, were still thinking about the revolution, never considering personal gains and losses. They fought for the defense of Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, for the liberation of all mankind, and for the magnificent cause of communism. In comparison, they felt that the brigade cadres serving the poor and lower-middle peasants was an inescapable responsibility. Through study, Xu You himself and many comrades were deeply educated and expressed their determination to be old yellow oxen for the revolution and the people for life.

To continuously establish the firm conviction of revolution to the end, the leadership team of Xujia Garden Brigade often linked the local class struggle with the study of Chairman Mao's theories on the dictatorship of the proletariat. Through recalling bitterness and sweetness, they understood the hard-won nature of the proletarian dictatorship. They said: "In the countryside, if we poor and lower-middle peasants do not hold power, can we let the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists hold power and restore capitalism?" They realized that as long as they held power with the public interests of the proletariat, they could forever follow Chairman Mao and avoid the restoration of capitalism.

To continuously promote their own thought revolutionization and ensure the use of proletarian public interests to hold power, they specially paid attention to letting Mao Zedong Thought occupy the home front, doing a good job in the ideological and political work of family members. In the past, some cadres were active in their work outside but encountered sharp conflicts between public and private interests when they returned home, sometimes even handling them poorly. After the leadership team of Xujia Garden Brigade recognized this problem at the principle level, they immediately focused on setting up family Mao Zedong Thought study classes, using Mao Zedong Thought to strongly promote the thought revolutionization of cadres' family members, making family members and cadres have the same heart and do the same things, encouraging cadres and adding strength, and being good assistants.

The process of the leadership team of Xujia Garden Brigade achieving revolutionization once again proved: The construction process of rural commune and brigade leadership teams is a process of fierce struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads. Proletarian revolutionary authority is recognized by the masses in struggle and practice, not self-appointed. Only by following Chairman Mao's great teachings of "never forgetting class struggle," using Mao Zedong Thought to continuously defeat the infiltration and attacks of bourgeois thought and all exploiting class thoughts, can the leadership team be built into a strong fighting fortress loyal to Chairman Mao.

    在伟大毛泽东思想指引下不断改进领导作风
    把领导班子建成忠于毛主席的坚强战斗堡垒
    许家园大队领导班子在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的新形势下进一步实现革命化的经验
    据新华社太原十七日电　在无产阶级文化大革命进入夺取全面胜利的新形势下，经受了两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争考验的农村社、队领导班子，怎样用毛泽东思想来不断改进领导作风，进一步实现革命化？山西阳高县罗文皂公社许家园大队领导班子，在这方面取得了一些经验。
    坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，把突出无产阶级政治摆在一切工作的首位
    许家园大队的领导班子，通过革命大批判，大破中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的反革命修正主义路线，同时认真学习了伟大领袖毛主席“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的伟大教导，采取请进来、派出去的方法，大学解放军的政治工作经验。在学习解放军的过程中，大队领导班子成员深刻地认识到：解放军在人民群众中所以有崇高的威信，最根本的原因就是他们忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他们毛泽东思想红旗举得高，无产阶级政治突出得好。大队的领导班子要进一步革命化，建立起无产阶级的革命权威，也必须走解放军的路子，忠于毛主席，紧跟毛主席，坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，把突出无产阶级政治摆在一切工作的首位。
    林副主席指示我们：“对毛泽东思想抱什么态度，是一个很重要的问题。我们就是要抓对毛主席的态度、对毛泽东思想的态度问题。”许家园大队领导班子在斗争的实践中深刻地认识到：以什么态度对待毛主席，是革命和反革命的分界线。忠于毛主席就要对伟大领袖毛主席有无限深厚的无产阶级感情；就要对毛泽东思想坚信不疑，对毛主席的每一条指示不折不扣地照办，对毛主席的战略部署紧跟不离。因此，毛主席的指示每当从文件、广播、报纸上传来，他们便以战斗的姿态，以高度的政治敏感，雷厉风行，闻风而动，迅速贯彻执行。去年，毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区时的重要指示一传来，大队领导班子立即广泛传达，发动干部和群众认真学习，深刻领会，大力宣传，坚决贯彻执行。全国人民轰轰烈烈地开展了革命的大批判，这个大队的领导班子便带头投入了这场火热的阶级斗争，他们带领广大贫下中农，大打“人民战争”，联系本大队现实的阶级斗争和当前的中心任务，向党内一小撮最大的走资派展开了大批判、大斗争。通过革命大批判，大大提高了干部、社员的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，加深了对中国赫鲁晓夫的无比仇恨，更进一步增强了对伟大领袖毛主席深厚的无产阶级感情。为了贯彻执行毛主席“要斗私，批修”和开办学习班的指示，大队领导班子马上派人向解放军学习经验，回来后就广泛发动群众，办起了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班二百七十多个，推动全大队活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动出现了新局面。干部和贫下中农克服了文化低、农活忙等困难，活学活用“老三篇”，以“完全”、“彻底”为尺子，以张思德、白求恩、老愚公为榜样，在灵魂深处爆发革命，破私立公，促进思想的革命化。毛主席深刻指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”毛主席最新指示传来，大队领导班子结合办学习班，发动贫下中农和社员群众更加深入地开展革命大批判，主动向阶级敌人发起猛烈进攻，抓住本村阶级敌人妄图瓦解集体经济等活生生的阶级斗争事实，组织广大贫下中农进行批判斗争，进一步提高了贫下中农和社员群众的阶级斗争觉悟。
    许家园大队领导班子成员把学习、宣传、执行、捍卫毛泽东思想作为最重要的任务，认真突出无产阶级政治的结果，受到了广大群众的信任、拥护和支持，无产阶级革命权威逐步建立起来。革命斗争的实践使他们深深体会到：真正的无产阶级革命权威来自毛主席，来自毛泽东思想，来自毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。群众信任、拥护和支持领导班子，是因为领导班子按毛主席的指示办事。因此，领导班子对毛主席越忠，跟毛主席越紧，无产阶级革命权威就越高。
    做群众的带头人、贴心人和小学生
    大队领导班子的威信在群众中逐步提高以后，有的同志产生了骄傲自满情绪，说话气儿粗了，调儿高了，深入群众却少了。群众很快觉察到了这些同志的问题，向他们提出了批评意见。但是有的同志接受不了，认为群众“不听话”，“不好管”。这件事立即引起大队领导班子的高度重视。
    怎样处理好干部和群众的关系？大队领导班子在解放军同志的帮助下，认真学习了毛主席关于群众路线的伟大教导，开展斗私批修活动。毛主席教导说：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”“我们历来主张革命要依靠人民群众，大家动手，反对只依靠少数人发号施令。”经过学习，结合批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，大家认识到，领导班子成员是从群众中产生出来的代表，要真正成为群众的贴心人，为群众服务好，必须甘当群众的小学生，倾听群众的意见，坚持群众路线，决不能摆出“我说了算”的架子，当群众的上司。生产大队的干部，只有用毛泽东思想教育群众的义务，而没有凭自己的“官位”去“管”群众的权利；只有启发群众听毛主席话的义务，而没有强制群众绝对服从自己的权利；干部、社员，谁的意见符合毛泽东思想，就照谁的意见办，这就是干部和社员共同听毛主席的话。对于干部来说，来自群众的意见，不论正面的、反面的，都应当虚心听取，严肃认真地对待，合理的意见要满腔热情地接受。从此以后，他们更加严格要求自己，进一步树立群众观点，坚持“从群众中来，到群众中去”的领导方法，广泛征求各方面的意见。对于群众的正当要求及时处理，及时解决，使群众人人敢说话，人人敢管事。大队领导班子内部，提倡人人敢于积极负责的作风，事情办错了，大家主动承担责任，从不互相推脱。工作有了成绩，大家首先归功伟大领袖毛主席，自己注意戒骄戒躁，谦虚谨慎。
    为了密切联系群众，大队领导班子一直用手勤、腿勤、嘴勤来要求自己。他们参加集体劳动，个个都是能手，劳动不问活计轻重，干活不分天气好坏，出勤不计报酬多少，同贫下中农劲往一处使，汗往一处流，评工时都不要高工分。平时，他们遵照毛主席“解决群众的穿衣问题，吃饭问题，住房问题，柴米油盐问题，疾病卫生问题，婚姻问题。总之，一切群众的实际生活问题，都是我们应当注意的问题”的教导，经常到贫下中农家里问寒问暖，征求意见，用自己的痛痒体察群众的困难，把从政治上、生活上关心群众当作一项重要工作来处理。贫下中农谁离家外出，他们就给谁家担水；谁家有事，就给谁家帮忙。对于在文化大革命中受了阶级敌人的蒙蔽曾经反对过自己的阶级兄弟，他们一视同仁地给予热情的帮助和照顾。社员张万荣，运动初期在坏人的蒙蔽下，和大队领导班子对立情绪很严重，可是大队领导班子成员一直把他当做阶级兄弟看待，不但谅解他，从政治上帮助、团结他，而且在各方面照顾他。去年他妻子生小孩后得了急病，大队四个主要干部有的连夜请医买药，有的通宵守候病人，忙了一夜，使病人安全脱险，张万荣深受感动。
    由于大队领导班子坚持按毛主席“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众”的教导办事，深深扎根于群众之中，始终保持着贫下中农的本色，群众也把他们看作是自己的代表，自己中的一员，处处亲近他们，支持他们，爱护他们。对于他们的正确领导坚决服从，对于他们工作中的缺点错误诚恳帮助，使干部、群众联系密切，步调一致，落实毛主席的各项指示就有了可靠的保证。群众赞扬说：“我们的干部，落实毛主席的指示是带头人，劳动是勤劳人，和我们相处是贴心人。他们是咱贫下中农的好勤务员。”既把自己当作革命的一份力量，又把自己当作
    革命的对象，当一辈子人民的老黄牛
    许家园大队领导班子在斗争中认识到，要带领贫下中农和社员群众沿着毛主席开辟的革命航道不断前进，干部必须走在前头，当干部的步子怎么迈，路子怎么走，都应当给群众做出榜样。所以，他们在毛泽东思想学习班上，在平时的工作中，总是带头斗私批修，既把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又不断地把自己当作革命的对象。
    大队党支部副书记许有，出身贫农家庭，在旧社会受尽了压迫和剥削。有一时期，他私心上升，总觉得当干部“费力不讨好”。大队领导班子认为，许有的思想向大家提出了一个十分重要的问题：当干部到底为了什么？为革命还是为了图名图利？这个问题解决不好，领导班子的无产阶级革命权威不可能建立，纵然建立起来，也不可能巩固。为了解决这个问题，他们在解放军同志的帮助下，反复学习光辉的“老三篇”。毛主席教导我们：“我们的共产党和共产党所领导的八路军、新四军，是革命的队伍。我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”对照毛主席的教导，联系自己的思想实际，他们认真思考，解放军南征北战，餐风饮雪，并没有人给记过工分；革命先烈们抛头颅，洒热血，赴汤蹈火，并不是为了得报酬；雷锋、王杰、李文忠、门合在牺牲的前一秒钟还在惦念着革命，根本没有考虑过个人得失。他们为的是捍卫毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，为的是解放全人类，为的是壮丽的共产主义事业。相比之下，更觉得大队干部为贫下中农服务办事，是义不容辞的责任。通过学习，许有本人和许多同志都深受教育，表示决心为革命、为人民当一辈子老黄牛。
    为了不断确立革命到底的坚定信心，许家园大队领导班子经常联系当地现实的阶级斗争，学习毛主席关于无产阶级专政的论述。他们通过忆苦思甜，懂得了无产阶级政权的来之不易。他们说：“在农村里，咱贫下中农不掌权，难道还能叫地、富、反、坏、右掌权，让他们去复辟资本主义？”他们认识到，只要自己是用无产阶级的公字来掌权，就能永远紧跟毛主席，避免资本主义复辟。
    为了不断促进自己的思想革命化，保证用无产阶级的公字来掌权，他们特别注意让毛泽东思想占领家庭这块阵地，做好家属的思想政治工作。过去，一些干部在外面工作积极，一回到家里，就遇到尖锐的公与私的矛盾，有时甚至处理不好。许家园大队领导班子提到原则高度认识了这个问题以后，立即抓紧大办家庭毛泽东思想学习班，用毛泽东思想大力促进干部家属的思想革命化，使家属和干部操一样的心，办一样的事，给干部鼓气、加劲，当好助手。
    许家园大队领导班子实现革命化的过程又一次证明：农村社、队领导班子的建设过程，是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争过程。无产阶级的革命权威是在斗争中、实践中群众公认的，不是自封的。只有遵循毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，用毛泽东思想不断战胜资产阶级思想和一切剥削阶级思想的侵蚀和进攻，才能把领导班子建设成为忠于毛主席的坚强战斗堡垒。
