Shanghai's pharmaceutical industry is mass-producing medicines needed in rural areas.

A June 25th report from Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai: The revolutionary workers of Shanghai's pharmaceutical industry, armed with the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, have launched a fierce criticism of the revisionist line pushed by China's Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the party in the fields of health and pharmaceuticals. This has allowed Shanghai's pharmaceutical industry to advance rapidly along the path indicated by Chairman Mao, with production flourishing. In 1967, the total industrial output of the entire industry exceeded the level of 1966; this year, production has been steadily increasing, with monthly plans being completed. Particularly noteworthy is that the revolutionary workers have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great directive to "focus medical and health work on rural areas." In the past two years, they have significantly increased the number of new drug varieties for the prevention and treatment of common and prevalent diseases in rural areas and have greatly reduced the cost of these products.

Shanghai's pharmaceutical industry developed rapidly during the Great Leap Forward under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Before liberation, Shanghai's pharmaceutical industry was extremely backward, only able to repack, repackage, and compound simple medicines like eye drops, ten-drop solutions, and pain relievers. During the Great Leap Forward, revolutionary workers responded to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao, relying on self-reliance to develop a relatively complete and advanced pharmaceutical industry system. However, the struggle between the two lines within Shanghai's pharmaceutical industry has been intense, focusing on the fundamental issues of who the industry serves and who it relies on for development. China's Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai, along with the capitalist roaders in the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Company, vigorously promoted a set of counter-revolutionary revisionist lines. They emphasized "expert" management, concentrating large amounts of manpower and resources to develop so-called "advanced" drugs in isolation, following behind capitalist countries, and paying little attention to the drugs needed for the prevention and treatment of common and prevalent diseases among the poor and lower-middle peasants and the broad laboring masses. This directly opposed Chairman Mao's teachings and revolutionary line.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, especially after the revolutionary masses won the power struggle in the "January Revolution," the revolutionary workers of Shanghai's pharmaceutical industry, armed with the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, launched a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism from the entire pharmaceutical industry system down to the workshops. They fiercely criticized and struggled against the handful of capitalist roaders within the party and the reactionary academic "authorities" they protected and promoted, thoroughly smashing the revisionist line promoted by China's Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai in the pharmaceutical industry. At the same time, they followed Chairman Mao's teachings and immediately took action to realize the great task of the pharmaceutical industry serving rural areas.

Many factories' revolutionary masses and workers, following Chairman Mao's great teachings, organized teams to go out of the factory, up the mountains, and down to the countryside to conduct investigations and research, taking a new step for the pharmaceutical industry to serve rural areas. They not only went to the ten counties of Shanghai's suburbs but also to Ningbo, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou in Zhejiang, Zhenjiang in Jiangsu, Zaoyang in Hubei, and Qimen in Anhui. They visited county hospitals, commune hospitals, production brigades, and poor and lower-middle peasants, understanding what medicines rural areas need most. Wherever they went, they propagated Chairman Mao's great teachings on medical and health work. Some factories even brought some newly developed drugs for the prevention and treatment of prevalent diseases in rural areas. When they saw the poor and lower-middle peasants expressing their deep proletarian feelings, thanking Chairman Mao for his care, and sincerely wishing Chairman Mao longevity, they felt even more the great concern Chairman Mao has for the people and the wisdom of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They resolved to make the pharmaceutical industry better serve rural areas and the poor and lower-middle peasants and laboring masses.

Following Chairman Mao's teachings, the revolutionary workers of Shanghai's pharmaceutical industry have spared no effort to develop new drugs needed in rural areas. In the past two years, they have successfully developed 116 new drugs, most of which are for the prevention and treatment of asthma, cough, parasitic diseases, stomach diseases, and pesticide poisoning—common and prevalent diseases in rural areas.

During the development process, they used Chairman Mao's teaching of "wholeheartedly serving the people" to inspire and urge themselves, striving for excellence to make the drugs cheap, effective, and convenient to use. For example, when farmers have asthma attacks, injecting a reliever is inconvenient, so the factory developed "Asthma Drops" and "Asthma Pills," which are cheap and convenient to use.

Many drug factories severely criticized the past capitalist roaders and reactionary academic "authorities" who looked down on traditional Chinese medicine, learning from rural doctors and poor and lower-middle peasants. They selected effective traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions for treating rural diseases, making them into traditional Chinese medicine or Chinese-Western medicine compounds. This is a new starting point for Shanghai's pharmaceutical industry to develop new drug varieties. For example, bile duct ascariasis is a common disease in rural areas. When the worm enters the bile duct, the patient suffers unbearable pain, usually requiring surgery. After learning that there is a traditional Chinese medicine in rural areas that can drive the worm out of the bile duct without surgery, a drug factory immediately organized a team to learn from rural hospitals. They carefully studied the effectiveness of this traditional Chinese medicine from tens of thousands of cases accumulated over more than a decade. When a large amount of scientific data proved that this traditional Chinese medicine had significant effects, the factory used this traditional Chinese medicine to successfully develop a convenient syrup.

During the development of new drugs, many revolutionary research and development personnel in drug factories went out of the laboratory, down to the factory and countryside, and into the workshops, working with workers to develop drugs. They thoroughly criticized the evil practices of the reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, such as seeking fame and fortune and monopolizing technology, and established a new spirit of communist cooperation. They shared information, cooperated, and worked together among drug factories, between drug factories and research institutions and schools, and between drug factories and hospitals, making the development of new drugs faster and more effective.

Reducing the cost of drugs for the treatment of common and prevalent diseases has been a characteristic of Shanghai's pharmaceutical industry in the past two years of combining revolution with production. In the past two years, the cost of 140 kinds of raw drugs and medicines in the city has been reduced by an average of 17%. Among them, the cost of the special drug for treating tinea capitis in rural areas, gray yellow melon, has been continuously reduced, and now the cost per kilogram is only half of what it was in 1965. The cost of drugs for preventing and treating malaria, such as chloroquine and berberine, has also been significantly reduced. The cost of the raw drug for the new drug "846" for treating schistosomiasis, which is provided free of charge by the state, is now only one-fourth of what it was in 1965.

### 听毛主席的话　把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去  上海医药工业大量生产农村需要的药品

    听毛主席的话　把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去
    上海医药工业大量生产农村需要的药品
    新华社上海二十五日电　上海医药工业战线革命职工以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大一小撮走资派在卫生工作和医药工业中推行的修正主义路线，使上海医药工业沿着毛主席指引的方向迅猛前进，生产出现一片兴旺景象。一九六七年，全行业的工业总产值超过了一九六六年的水平；今年以来，生产蒸蒸日上，月月都完成了国家计划。特别可喜的是，广大革命职工坚决贯彻毛主席“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的伟大指示，在近两年内大量增加农村常见病、多发病的防治药物新品种，而且大幅度地降低了这类产品的成本。
    上海医药工业是在大跃进的年代里，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下迅速发展起来的。解放前，上海医药工业极端落后，只能用外国药物分装、改装、配制眼药水、十滴水、解热止痛片等极普通的成药。大跃进中，广大革命职工响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，自力更生，发展起了品种比较齐全、具有相当水平的医药工业体系。但是，上海医药工业中两条路线的斗争非常激烈，斗争的焦点是医药工业为谁服务和依靠谁来发展这两个根本问题。中国赫鲁晓夫及其在上海的代理人，以及上海医药工业公司的走资派，竭力推行一整套反革命修正主义路线。他们大搞“专家”治厂，集中大批人力物力，闭门造车，跟在资本主义国家屁股后面爬行，研究所谓“尖端”药物，对农村贫下中农和广大劳动人民中一些常见病、多发病防治所需要的药物，非常轻视，直接对抗毛主席的教导，对抗毛主席的革命路线。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，特别是无产阶级革命派在“一月革命”中取得夺权斗争胜利以后，上海医药工业战线上的广大革命职工，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，从整个医药工业系统到各厂的班组，开展了深入持久的革命大批判，狠狠批判和斗争了党内一小撮走资派和他们所包庇、重用的资产阶级反动学术“权威”，大破中国赫鲁晓夫及其在上海代理人在医药工业方面推行的修正主义路线。同时，他们遵照毛主席的教导，立即为实现医药工业面向农村这一伟大任务而行动了起来。
    不少厂的无产阶级革命派和革命职工，遵循毛主席的伟大教导，组织人力走出工厂，上山下乡，进行调查研究，为医药工业面向农村跨出了新的一步。他们不仅深入到上海郊区十个县，还到了浙江的宁波、杭州、嘉兴、湖州，江苏的镇江，湖北的枣阳，安徽的祁门等地。他们从县中心医院、人民公社医院、生产队一直到贫下中农，都亲身作了访问和调查，了解农村最需要什么药物。他们每到一处，就宣传毛主席关于医疗卫生工作方面的伟大教导。有的厂还送去一些新近试制成功的防治农村多发病的药物。当他们看到贫下中农怀着深厚的无产阶级感情，感谢毛主席的关怀，衷心祝愿毛主席万寿无疆的动人场面时，更加体会到毛主席对人民群众无微不至关怀的伟大胸怀，更加体会到毛主席革命路线的英明伟大。他们下定决心，要让医药工业更好地面向农村，为贫下中农和劳动人民服务。
    上海医药工业战线上的革命职工遵照毛主席的教导，想方设法创制农村需要的新药。两年来，他们试制成功了一百十六种新药，其中大部分是防治气喘、咳嗽、寄生虫病、胃病、农药中毒等农村多发病和常见病的。
    在试制过程中，他们以毛主席的“全心全意地为人民服务”的教导来激励自己，鞭策自己，精益求精，使药品达到价廉、效高、使用方便。农民哮喘发作时注射止喘剂不方便，药厂就试制了“平喘露”和“止喘栓”，价钱便宜，使用方便。
    许多药厂狠狠批判了过去走资派和反动学术“权威”看不起中药的反动观点，向农村医生学习，向贫下中农学习，选了具有很好疗效的治疗农村疾病的中药方，做成中药或中西药合剂。这是上海医药工业发展新药品种的一个新的起点。胆道蛔虫病是农村一种常见病，蛔虫钻入胆道后，病人疼痛不堪，通常只有开刀。一个药厂得知农村有一种中药可以不开刀就驱蛔虫出胆道以后，马上组织人力到农村医院学习。他们从十多年来积累的几万份病例中，一份份地查出胆道蛔虫病例，仔细研究这种中药的效果。当大量科学数据证明这种中药有显著效果时，药厂就采用这种中药试制成功了服用方便的糖浆。
    在试制新药的过程中，不少药厂革命的试验研究人员走出试验室，下厂下乡，下车间，同工人一道试制。他们大破资产阶级反动学术“权威”争名夺利、封锁技术等恶劣的思想作风，大立共产主义协作新风，在药厂之间，药厂与科研单位和学校之间，药厂与医院之间，互通资料，互相配合，共同协作，使新的药品的试验工作速度更快，药品疗效更好。
    千方百计降低治疗常见病和多发病药品的成本，是上海医药工业战线两年来抓革命、促生产的一个特色。两年来，全市已有一百四十一种原料药和药品，成本平均下降了百分之十七。其中农村治头癣的特效药灰黄梅素，成本连续下降，现在每公斤的成本只相当于一九六五年的一半。防治疟疾的氯奎、伯奎，成本也大幅度下降。国家免费供应的治疗血吸虫病的新药“八四六”，现在的原料药成本只相当一九六五年的四分之一。
