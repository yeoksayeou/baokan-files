    “Revolutionary Committee Members Have Nothing Special”

    Wei Wenbin, a standing committee member of the county revolutionary committee, was originally a leader of a revolutionary mass organization. After joining the revolutionary committee, he often said, “In the past, we shared life and death with the broad revolutionary masses, endured hardships together, and seized power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the party. In the future, we must breathe together with the broad revolutionary masses, share the same destiny, and hold and use power for the proletariat.”

    Last May, when the county-level organs were adjusting their dormitories, the comrade in charge of logistics planned to arrange a single room for Wei Wenbin. Upon hearing this, he immediately found this comrade and said, “First, arrange for the comrades. Revolutionary committee members have nothing special; they should live together with the comrades.” This incident made him reflect deeply: the masses’ view of him was truly different from before. In this situation, I must be more humble and cautious and never detach myself from the masses!

    Soon after, there was a worker in the organ who, due to differing views with everyone, many people did not want to live with him. Wei Wenbin learned about this and thought that this comrade had been influenced by anarchist thoughts in society and did not see clearly the complexity of class struggle. This was just a matter of awareness. He had the responsibility to use Mao Zedong Thought to help him raise his consciousness, distinguish between enemies and ourselves, and fight together with the broad revolutionary masses. Therefore, he went to discuss with Li Weijun, a revolutionary committee member who lived in the same room, “The two of us living together means less contact with the masses and less hearing of the masses’ voices. We should live separately.” Li Weijun then moved to live with other comrades. Following this, Wei Wenbin persuaded the other comrade who lived in the same room to let that comrade with differing views move into their room. Through patient and meticulous help, this comrade’s awareness improved significantly, feeling that his past understanding was wrong. His relationship with the comrades also improved.

    Wei Wenbin is always vigilant against detaching himself from the masses and actively seeks to connect with the masses. Last summer and autumn harvests, he spent two and a half months going deep into the grassroots, working with poor and lower-middle peasants to study Chairman Mao’s works, labor together, and help the production brigade to focus on revolution and vigorously promote production. After Chairman Mao’s great call to “fight selfishness and criticize revisionism” was issued, he immediately responded and went to Dingguantun Production Brigade to work with poor and lower-middle peasants to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes. He further deepened his class feelings with the poor and lower-middle peasants.

    “革委会委员没有什么特殊的”
    县革命委员会常委魏文彬，原是革命群众组织的负责人。参加革命委员会工作以后，他常说：“过去，我们和广大革命群众同生死，共患难，夺了党内一小撮走资派的权。今后，我们更要和广大革命群众同呼吸，共命运，为无产阶级掌好权、用好权。”
    去年五月，县级机关调整宿舍的时候，负责总务的同志，打算给魏文彬同志安排一个单间。他听说以后，立即找到这位同志，对他说：“先把同志们安排好。革委会委员没有什么特殊的，应该和同志们住在一起。”这件事，引起了他的深思：群众对自己的看法同以前真是不一样了。在这种情况下，我可更要谦虚、谨慎，万万不可脱离群众啊！
    不久，机关里有一个工作人员，由于和大家观点对立，好些人都不愿意和他住在一起。魏文彬知道后，认为这个同志受了社会上无政府主义思潮的影响，看不清阶级斗争的复杂性，这只是认识问题。自己有责任用毛泽东思想帮助他提高觉悟，分清敌我，和广大革命群众一道战斗。于是，他就找同屋住的革命委员会委员李维军商量：“咱俩住在一起，接触群众少，听到群众的声音也少，应该分开住。”李维军便搬到了其他同志中间。接着，魏文彬又说服了住同屋的另一位同志，请那个跟大家观点对立的同志搬到他们的房间里来。经过耐心细致的帮助，这个同志的思想认识有了很大提高，感到自己过去的认识很不对头。他和同志之间的关系也改进了。
    魏文彬时刻警惕自己脱离群众，主动积极地去联系群众。去年夏收、秋收，他利用两个半月的时间，深入基层，和贫下中农一起学习毛主席著作，一起劳动，帮助大队狠抓革命，猛促生产。毛主席关于“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召发出以后，他又闻风而动，到丁官屯大队跟贫下中农一道，大办毛泽东思想学习班。他同贫下中农进一步结下了深厚的阶级感情。
