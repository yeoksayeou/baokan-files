The wave of student protests in West Germany against the corrupt education system and poor learning conditions continues to surge.

In the West German capital of Bonn, after more than 600 students from the education college announced an indefinite strike on June 24, they marched to the state capital of Düsseldorf in North Rhine-Westphalia on June 26. Students carried numerous banners in front of the state parliament, then marched through the city and distributed leaflets to the public. Students from nearby cities such as Cologne, Aachen, Neuss, and Wuppertal also traveled to Düsseldorf to participate in the march, swelling the ranks of the protesters.

The West German authorities were terrified of the student demonstrations and deployed hundreds of police officers and numerous police cars to monitor the march. They also set up a cordon in front of the state parliament to prevent the protesters from approaching.

In the city of Constance, 3,000 engineering school students held a demonstration and march on June 24, demanding changes to the teaching conditions at the engineering school. The students' just actions were met with brutal suppression by the police. Police beat the demonstrators with batons and threw tear gas at them. Enraged students retaliated by throwing stones at the police. Twenty-one students were unjustly arrested. That evening, 300 demonstrators went to the police station to demand the release of the arrested students, but were met with brutal suppression. However, under the strong pressure from the demonstrators, the police had to release the arrested students.

The police brutality sparked great anger among the students. In support of the engineering school students, the University of Constance students held a meeting on June 25 and passed a resolution condemning the police brutality, demanding freedom of speech and the right to demonstrate, and calling for an immediate halt to the police's savage actions.

On June 21, 1,500 students from the engineering school and economics faculty in Dortmund held a march and demonstration. Many students sat at intersections, causing traffic jams in the city. After the march, the demonstrators held a mass meeting demanding reforms to the current corrupt education system.

On the same day, in cities such as Düsseldorf, Hagen, and Gelsenkirchen, students distributed leaflets to the public, condemning the poor learning conditions at the engineering schools. One hundred twenty-five psychology students from the University of Tübingen also occupied an office of a municipal agency in Tübingen to protest the poor teaching conditions and lack of teachers at the school. However, the students' rebellious actions were met with brutal suppression. On June 22, the head of the Tübingen municipal government and the president of the University of Tübingen led more than 400 police officers to attack the students. Police armed with pickaxes and axes stormed into the room, grabbing students at random. The students built barricades with desks, filing cabinets, and various pieces of furniture and fought bravely against the police. Twenty-seven students were unjustly arrested.

    西德学生运动一浪高一浪
    各地学生接连集会示威反对腐朽的教育制度
    新华社波恩二十七日电　西德各地学生反对腐朽教育制度和恶劣学习条件的斗争浪潮日益汹涌澎湃。
    在西德首都波恩，六百多名教育学院学生在二十四日宣布无限期罢课后，二十六日清晨又前往波恩所在的北来因—威斯特伐利亚州的首府杜塞尔多夫市举行抗议示威。学生们打着无数标语牌在州议会前示威，随后又在市内举行了游行，并向市民散发传单。附近的科隆、亚琛、诺伊斯和伍佩尔塔尔等城市的教育学院学生为了表示支持，也特地赶到杜塞尔多夫参加游行，壮大了示威队伍的声势。
    西德当局对学生的示威怕得要命，派出了数百名警察和大批警车监视游行队伍，并且在州议会前布置了警戒线，阻止示威队伍走近州议会。
    在君士坦士市，三千名工程学校的学生二十四日举行示威游行，要求改变工程学校的教学状况。学生们的正义行动遭到警察的野蛮镇压。警察用警棍殴打示威学生，并向学生投掷催泪弹。愤怒的学生用石块向警察进行反击。有二十一名学生被无理逮捕。当晚，三百名示威者又前往警察局要求释放被捕的学生，遭到警察的残酷镇压，但是在示威学生的强大压力下，警察不得不释放了被捕的学生。
    警察的暴行激起了学生们的极大愤怒，为了表示对工程学校学生的支持，君士坦士大学的学生二十五日举行了集会并发表了一项决议，抗议警察暴行，要求有言论和示威游行的自由，并要求当局马上停止警察的野蛮暴行。
    二十一日，多特蒙德工程学校和经济学院的一千五百名学生举行游行示威。许多学生坐在十字路口，使市内交通堵塞。示威者在游行后，还举行了群众大会，要求改革现行的腐朽教育制度。
    同一天，在杜塞尔多夫、哈根和盖尔森基尔欣等城市，学生们向市民散发传单，谴责工程学校恶劣的学习条件；土宾根大学心理学系的一百二十五名学生还占领了土宾根市政当局所属机构的一个办公室，以表示抗议学校恶劣的教学条件和教师不足。但是，学生们的造反行为遭到了残酷镇压。二十二日，土宾根市政当局的负责人和土宾根大学校长率领了四百多名警察向学生进行袭击。手执铁镐和斧头的警察冲进室内，乱抓学生。学生们用办公桌、档案柜和各种家具筑起壁垒，同警察展开了英勇的搏斗。有二十七名学生被无理逮捕。
