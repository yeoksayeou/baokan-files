Approximately 40,000 patriotic workers, youth, students, and citizens of Tokyo held a large-scale anti-American rally and demonstration at the east and west entrances of the state-owned Tokyo Shibuya Station in the evening of June 26. They strongly protested against the reactionary Sato government's servitude to American imperialism's aggressive policies, and the transportation of fuel and explosives for American jet aircraft by the Japanese National Railways.

About 5,000 students and young workers gathered at the square in front of the east entrance of Shibuya Station. Many citizens supported their struggle, and the number of people gathered in the square increased to 20,000. The square was filled with red flags and banners. The banners read: "We oppose the transportation of jet fuel for American troops by rail tankers," "Oppose American aggression in Vietnam." Student and worker representatives addressed the crowd, severely condemning the Sato reactionary government for acting as a faithful lackey of American imperialism and serving American imperialism's policy of aggression against Asia. They also expressed their strong support for the Vietnamese people's heroic struggle against American aggression for national liberation.

After the rally, students and young workers held a demonstration march around the streets of Shibuya Station, receiving enthusiastic support from the citizens along the way.

Later, workers and students divided into several groups and entered the tracks at Shibuya Station. They broke through the police blockade, holding up red banners and shouting anti-American slogans, and held a demonstration march. Workers and students occupied the platforms and tracks, causing 12 passenger and freight trains, including oil tankers transporting jet fuel for American troops, to stop running, and 78 trains were delayed.

Meanwhile, about 20,000 workers and citizens held a rally in a park in front of the west entrance of Shibuya Station. Japanese Trade Union Confederation Vice Chairman Tomita Tomitaro said at the meeting: "Our struggle to abolish the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty' and remove American military bases is a necessary struggle to maintain national dignity. Let us fight to the end to thoroughly defeat American imperialism and the Sato reactionary government."

After the meeting, workers held a massive demonstration march on the streets near Shibuya Station. They shouted slogans such as "Smash the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty'," "Remove all American military bases in Japan." Three hundred members of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) held up red banners reading "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought" and joined the workers' demonstration march.

Approximately 20,000 workers, students, and citizens of Japan held an anti-American rally at Tokyo Shibuya Station on the evening of June 26, blocking the transportation of fuel and ammunition for American jet aircraft. After the rally, a large crowd rushed into the station and held a demonstration on the tracks, causing railway transportation to come to a standstill.

    东京四万爱国工人学生奋起示威  不准为美帝运输军火的列车通过
    示威工人高呼“粉碎日美‘安全条约’”，要求撤除一切美军基地
    新华社二十七日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本东京的爱国工人、青年、学生和市民约四万人，二十六日傍晚，在日本国营铁路东京新宿车站的东口和西口，举行了大规模的反美集会和示威游行，强烈抗议佐藤反动政府为美帝国主义侵略政策效劳，为美军的喷气式飞机运输燃料和火药。
    约五千名学生和青年工人在新宿车站东口前面的广场上举行集会。许多市民支持他们的斗争，聚集在广场的人数越来越多，后来达到两万人。广场上到处都是红旗和横幅标语。横幅标语上面写着的口号有：“我们反对用铁路油槽车为美军运输喷气式飞机的燃料”、“反对美国侵略越南”。学生和工人代表向群众发表讲话，严厉谴责佐藤反动政府充当美帝国主义的忠实走狗，为美帝国主义侵略亚洲的政策效劳的罪行。他们还表示热烈声援越南人民抗美救国的英勇斗争。
    集会后，学生和青年工人在新宿车站周围的街道，举行了示威游行，沿途受到市民们的热烈支持。
    在这以后，工人和学生们分成好几支队伍进入新宿车站的路线场。他们冲破了武装警察的封锁线，高举红色横幅，大声高呼反美口号，举行示威游行。工人和学生们占领了月台和路轨，使十二列客车和货车，其中包括为美军拖运喷气式飞机燃料的油槽车被迫停止开行，七十八列火车误点。
    与此同时，约有两万工人和市民在新宿车站西口前面的一个公园里举行了集会。日本工会总评议会副议长兼田富太郎在会上讲话说：“我们旨在废除日美‘安全条约’和撤除美国军事基地的斗争，是维护民族尊严所必需的斗争。让我们为彻底打倒美帝国主义和佐藤反动政府而战斗到底。”
    会后，工人们在新宿车站附近的街道，举行了声势浩大的示威游行。他们沿途高呼“粉碎日美‘安全条约’”、“撤除设在日本的一切美国军事基地”等口号。日中友好协会（正统）的三百名会员举着“毛泽东思想万岁”的红布横幅，同工人们一起参加示威游行。（附图片）
