Uruguayan workers and students have been persistently carrying out strikes and class boycotts, undeterred by the reactionary government's suppression. Following a massive demonstration by 3,000 workers and students on the 12th, the Uruguayan reactionary government issued so-called "security measures," banning demonstrations and declaring martial law to intensify the suppression of workers and students.

However, the broad masses of revolutionary people in Uruguay paid no heed to the government's prohibitions and continued their demonstrations. Four thousand students held another public gathering to protest the government's reactionary educational plan. The demonstrating students also engaged in fierce struggles with the police who came to suppress them, resulting in ten police officers being injured. On the 13th, Uruguayan teachers and professors held a nationwide two-day strike in support of the students' struggle. As of the 17th, the students' struggle continued, with the national university and all middle schools across the country remaining closed. Meanwhile, postal workers also defied the government's order to return to work and continued their strike.

    乌拉圭工人学生不畏强暴坚持斗争
    本报讯　乌拉圭工人和学生的罢工、罢课斗争，不顾反动政府的镇压仍在坚持中。在十二日三千名工人和学生举行强大示威之后，乌拉圭反动政府颁布了所谓“安全措施”，禁止示威游行，宣布实行“戒严”，加紧镇压工人和学生运动。
    但是，广大乌拉圭革命群众不理会政府这一套禁令，继续进行示威。四千名学生再次公开举行集会，抗议政府的反动教育计划。示威学生还同前来镇压的警察进行了激烈的搏斗，有十名警察受伤。十三日，乌拉圭教师和教授举行两天全国性罢教，支持学生斗争。直到十七日，学生斗争还在坚持，国立大学和全国所有中学仍然关着大门。与此同时，邮局工作人员也不服从政府的复工命令继续罢工。
