The glorious image of Comrade Men He, a hero nurtured by the great thought of Mao Zedong and a good cadre who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, deeply inspires the members of the Revolutionary Committee of Zhejiang Province who are striving for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Recently, with revolutionary fervor, they have studied the hero's deeds over and over again and held discussions on their learning experiences. Everyone believes that Comrade Men He's glorious life was one of complete and thorough service to the people, a life of charging into battle to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Learning from the hero means fighting for a lifetime to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, just as the hero did.

During the discussions, everyone emphasized: The newly established Revolutionary Committee is tasked with leading tens of millions of proletarians and revolutionary masses to attack the class enemy and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to completion. In the mass movement to learn from Men He, the members of the revolutionary three-in-one leadership team must seriously study, take the lead in studying, and quickly master the revolutionary spirit and lofty qualities of Comrade Men He.

	Like Comrade Men He, constantly raise the awareness of defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line

In Comrade Men He's life, no matter where he went or when, he never stopped fighting to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The comrades participating in the discussion believed that this was because Comrade Men He had a high level of awareness of the struggle between the two lines.

The comrades participating in the discussion believed that Comrade Men He's high level of awareness in defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line was concentrated in the "three sameness": First, whether fighting against open enemies or hidden enemies, the awareness of struggle is the same; second, whether the struggle between the two lines is in its early stages or in a very intense stage, the awareness of struggle is the same; third, whether in a situation of being isolated and attacked or in a situation of being supported by the masses, the awareness of struggle is the same. The comrades participating in the discussion believed that the main difference between us and Comrade Men He lies in these three sameness, and we must strive to narrow this gap. Comrade Men He set a standard for his life: "Think of everything for Chairman Mao, follow everything for Chairman Mao, follow closely behind Chairman Mao, and do everything for Chairman Mao." He fully realized these four "everything" with his blood and life, embodying his infinite loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. We must, like the hero, focus on the "loyalty" to Chairman Mao, using these four "everything" to guide everything we do.

	Mao Zedong Thought nurtures heroes. The comrades participating in the discussion said that Comrade Men He could stand firmly on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line for a lifetime and fight to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line for a lifetime precisely because he was infinitely loyal to the great thought of Mao Zedong. He armed his mind with Mao Zedong Thought and used Mao Zedong Thought to observe and identify all kinds of class enemies. He had a deep understanding of Chairman Mao's theory of class struggle and Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, and principles on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. He consciously used Chairman Mao's theory of class struggle and class analysis to analyze everything and distinguish the class nature of all thoughts, speeches, and actions. He used Chairman Mao's instructions as the sole criterion for measuring everything. Whatever is in line with Mao Zedong Thought and beneficial to socialism, he would resolutely carry out and support; whatever is against Mao Zedong Thought and detrimental to socialism, he would resolutely resist and oppose. It is precisely because of this that Comrade Men He stood firmly on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in the complex struggle between the two lines, unshakable. The comrades participating in the discussion said that learning from the hero means, like the hero, focusing on the active learning and application of Mao Zedong Thought, using Mao Zedong Thought to measure and criticize everything more consciously.

The comrades participating in the discussion believed that Zhejiang is located on the coastal defense front, where class struggle is sharp and complex. As members of the provincial Revolutionary Committee, which is the command center for class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, we should learn seriously from Comrade Men He, never forget class struggle, raise the awareness of defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, constantly study and master the new characteristics, trends, and issues of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and actively and unceasingly launch attacks on the class enemy, carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to completion.

	Like Comrade Men He, stand guard and fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line

Comrade Men He's glorious life was filled with the spirit of thorough proletarian revolution to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The comrades participating in the discussion unanimously believed that at the moment of achieving the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must, like Comrade Men He, "always stand guard and fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line," fully playing the role of the Revolutionary Committee as a fighting fortress.

The comrades participating in the discussion believed that in the past, during the life-and-death struggle against the bourgeois reactionary line, whether we could set aside our personal interests, dare to go against the tide, fight against the waves, and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to the death was a test of whether we had the spirit of thorough revolution to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Now, we have changed from being suppressed to being in power. Whether we can continue the struggle between the two lines and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to completion is a new test of whether we have the spirit of thorough revolution to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They said that the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee is our great victory and the enemy's heavy defeat. However, the reactionary nature of the class enemy determines that after suffering defeat, they will inevitably struggle desperately, trying to disrupt and sabotage Chairman Mao's revolutionary line from the right or ultra-"left" side. We should, like Comrade Men He, with high class vigilance, stand guard and keep watch for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, quickly and accurately grasp the new trends of class struggle, and bravely fight against all kinds of class enemies. Only with such a spirit of thorough revolution can we carry the revolution to completion. If we become complacent and slack off because of the victory of the revolution, the revolutionary cause will suffer losses. This is disloyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "It is either the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind or the West Wind prevailing over the East Wind. There is no room for compromise on the issue of line." Everyone believed: The objective laws of class struggle are not subject to human will. If we do not take the initiative to attack the enemy, the enemy will attack us; if we attack proactively, the enemy will not dare to move. To seize the initiative in class struggle, we must, like Comrade Men He, always fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Although our position has changed with the needs of the revolution, the spirit of daring to struggle must never change. If we become "afraid of chaos and seek stability" after coming to power and do not take the initiative to attack the enemy, we will fall into the enemy's trap, giving the class enemy an opportunity. Everyone believed that Comrade Men He could always fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line because he regarded every victory as the starting point of a new struggle. Only in this way can we continuously achieve one victory after another. Comrade Men He's famous saying, "One step of rest on the revolutionary road means falling behind," is a reminder for us to further carry forward the spirit of thorough proletarian revolution.

The comrades participating in the discussion said that to fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, ultimately, we must fight the battle of eliminating selfishness and establishing public-mindedness in our minds. The "fear" in the struggle between the two lines reflects the "self" in one's worldview. Whether it is for "public" or "self," whether it is true loyalty or false loyalty to Chairman Mao, will all be strictly tested in the battle to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Only by being selfless can one be fearless. Only by, like Comrade Men He, daring to fire at the "self," daring to fight against "selfishness," and establishing a big "public" of red Mao Zedong Thought in one's mind, can one, like Comrade Men He, always firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, "always stand guard and fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!"

	Like Comrade Men He, never be separated from the masses

Comrade Men He is a model of maintaining close ties with the masses. For twenty years, he has always lived among the masses. Wherever he went, he united with the local people and mobilized the masses to fight for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The comrades participating in the discussion expressed that they would take Comrade Men He as an example, further strengthen their ties with the masses, fully mobilize the masses, and build the Revolutionary Committee into a revolutionary, closely-tied-with-the-masses battle command center. They believed that whether one could, like Comrade Men He, maintain close ties with the masses for a lifetime ultimately depends on one's attitude towards the masses and one's fundamental attitude towards Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The participation of revolutionary mass representatives in the three-in-one Revolutionary Committee has deeply rooted the proletarian dictatorship among the masses, which is a great advantage of the three-in-one Revolutionary Committee and a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in organization. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The most fundamental principle of reforming state organs is to connect with the masses." After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, will it take the path of closely connecting with the masses or become a bureaucratic organization high above the masses? This is a struggle between the two lines in the construction of political power, and the focus of the struggle is the attitude towards the masses. Everyone unanimously expressed that they would definitely follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, take Comrade Men He as an example, firmly believe in the masses, rely on the masses, fully mobilize the masses, and build the Revolutionary Committee into a "revolutionary, closely-tied-with-the-masses leadership team," making the proletarian revolutionary political power deeply rooted among the masses. If one cannot correctly treat the masses and does not actively mobilize the masses, one will inevitably be separated from the masses, which not only cannot play the advantages of the three-in-one Revolutionary Committee but also has the danger of changing color.

Why does Comrade Men He have a high level of awareness of maintaining close ties with the masses? Everyone believed that this is because he first regarded maintaining close ties with the masses as a necessity to defeat the class enemy and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. He compared himself to a soldier in the revolution, so in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he could closely unite with the revolutionary people, lead the revolutionary people to bravely fight against the class enemy, and contribute everything to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Everyone believed that learning from Comrade Men He's revolutionary spirit of maintaining close ties with the masses means, like him, in the sharp and complex class struggle, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm and mobilize the masses, leading millions of masses to actively launch fierce attacks on the class enemy, implementing the dictatorship of the people under the leadership of the proletarian party over a small handful of class enemies, and mobilizing the masses to reform and supervise the class enemy. Only in this way can the proletarian dictatorship be consolidated.

The comrades participating in the discussion said that to make the proletarian revolutionary political power never change color, one must, like Comrade Men He, maintain close ties with the masses and mobilize the masses to constantly supervise oneself; the members of the Revolutionary Committee must, like Comrade Men He, immerse themselves among the masses and learn from the masses.

	"Only by representing the masses can one educate the masses, and only by being a student of the masses can one be a teacher of the masses." Only by immersing oneself among the masses and maintaining close ties with the masses can one hear the voice of the masses, undergo the criticism and supervision of the masses, absorb nutrients from the masses, and gather the opinions and demands of the masses to insist on them; only in this way can one truly represent the interests of the masses, meet the needs of the people, and gain the support and approval of the broad masses, making our proletarian revolutionary political power more consolidated. If one is separated from the masses and loses the criticism and supervision of the masses, there is the danger of one's own degeneration.

	Like Comrade Men He, forever firmly follow the great leader Chairman Mao

Among the provincial Revolutionary Committee members participating in the discussion, some are old soldiers who followed Chairman Mao in his campaigns north and south, and some are revolutionary youngsters who emerged during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They believed that Comrade Men He had the awareness of defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the thorough proletarian revolutionary spirit of charging into battle against the class enemy, and the revolutionary spirit of maintaining close ties with the masses and being a student of the masses precisely because he had an infinitely sincere red heart towards the great leader Chairman Mao, the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The seven shining words, "Everything follow Chairman Mao," highly summarize the glorious path of Comrade Men He's growth. Everyone believed that learning from the hero means, like the hero, "everything follow Chairman Mao," step by step following Chairman Mao, forever following Chairman Mao.

Everyone reviewed the glorious battle course of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past two years and deeply felt that following Chairman Mao means victory. After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, the revolutionary journey is longer. To forever stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in the long and complex class struggle in the future and never fall behind, one must forever follow Chairman Mao. Everyone believed that the issue of standing in line is not a one-time effort. In the sharp and complex class struggle in the socialist period, one stands in line every day. If one does not follow Chairman Mao for one day, one may stand in the wrong line. Only by following Chairman Mao every day can one forever maintain revolutionary youthfulness.

Everyone said that to achieve the goal of forever following Chairman Mao, one must constantly regard oneself as the object of revolution, like Comrade Men He, forever engage in the front line of the struggle between the two lines, revolutionize oneself for a lifetime, and reform one's thoughts for a lifetime. Everyone deeply felt that the situation of class struggle is ever-changing. Only by learning and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the brilliant "Three Old Articles" in the storm of class struggle with the spirit of "seizing the day," thoroughly reforming one's worldview, can one forge a red heart of loyalty to Chairman Mao, can one stand firmly, distinguish right from wrong, and clarify the direction, and can one forever stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, firmly advancing along the direction indicated by the great leader Chairman Mao!

During the discussion, old soldiers and revolutionary cadres who had followed Chairman Mao through countless battles unanimously expressed that they would definitely remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "not relying on past merits but creating new achievements," believe in the masses and the party, correctly treat oneself, and truly achieve the goal of forever following Chairman Mao in the struggle between the two lines, forever being loyal to Chairman Mao. They must forever raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, truly build the Revolutionary Committee into a battle command center that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

    把革委会建设成为永远忠于毛主席革命路线的战斗指挥部
    ——浙江省革委会负责同志学习门合同志英雄事迹座谈纪要
    伟大的毛泽东思想哺育成长的英雄——“无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部”门合同志的光辉形象，深深地激励着正在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的浙江省革命委员会成员。最近，他们怀着革命激情，一遍又一遍地学习英雄事迹，一次又一次地座谈学习心得。大家认为，门合同志光辉的一生，是完全彻底为人民服务的一生，是为捍卫毛主席的革命路线而冲锋陷阵的一生。向英雄学习，就是要象英雄那样，一辈子为捍卫毛主席的革命路线而战斗。
    在座谈中，大家强调指出：新生的革命委员会，担负着率领千百万无产阶级和革命群众向阶级敌人举行进攻，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的伟大任务。在学习门合的群众运动中，革命三结合领导班子的成员，一定要认真学，带头学，迅速把门合同志的革命精神和崇高品质学到手。
    象门合同志那样，不断提高捍卫毛主席革命路线的自觉性
    在门合同志的一生中，无论是到什么地方，无论是在什么时候，他总是不停息地为捍卫毛主席的革命路线而战斗。参加座谈的同志认为，这是由于门合同志有两条路线斗争的高度自觉性。
    参加座谈的同志认为，门合同志捍卫毛主席无产阶级革命路线的高度自觉性，集中地表现在“三个一样”上。这就是：第一，不论是向公开的敌人进行斗争还是向隐蔽的敌人进行斗争，斗争的自觉性完全一样；第二，不论是两条路线斗争处于苗子刚刚露头的阶段还是处于十分激烈的阶段，斗争的自觉性完全一样；第三，不论是被孤立和遭到打击的境遇，还是在得到群众拥护的时候，斗争的自觉性完全一样。参加座谈的同志认为，我们和门合同志之间的主要差距，也表现在这三个一样上，要努力在这方面缩短差距。门合同志为他的一生规定了一个准则：“一切想着毛主席，一切服从毛主席，一切紧跟毛主席，一切为着毛主席。”他以自己的鲜血和生命，完全实现了这四个“一切”，体现了他对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚。我们要象英雄那样，在对毛主席无限忠诚的“忠”字上狠下功夫，要以这四个“一切”来统帅自己的一切。
    毛泽东思想育英雄。参加座谈的同志说，门合同志所以能一辈子坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线上，一辈子为捍卫毛主席的革命路线而斗争，正是由于他无限忠于伟大的毛泽东思想。他用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，用毛泽东思想去观察和识别形形色色的阶级敌人。他对毛主席的阶级斗争理论有深刻的理解，对毛主席的关于无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针、政策有深刻的理解。他自觉地用毛主席的阶级斗争理论和阶级分析的方法，去分析一切，辨清一切思想、言论、行动的阶级性。他以毛主席的指示作为衡量一切的唯一标准，凡是符合毛泽东思想、有利于社会主义的，他就坚决执行，坚决支持；凡是违反毛泽东思想、不利于社会主义的，他就坚决抵制，坚决反对。正是因为这样，门合同志在复杂的两条路线斗争中坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上，毫不动摇。参加座谈的同志说，学习英雄，就要象英雄那样，在活学活用毛泽东思想上狠下功夫，更自觉地用毛泽东思想衡量一切，批判一切。
    参加座谈的同志认为，浙江地处海防前线，阶级斗争尖锐复杂。作为阶级斗争、两条路线斗争指挥部的省革委会的成员，更应该认真地向门合同志学习，念念不忘阶级斗争，提高捍卫毛主席革命路线的自觉性，不断研究和掌握阶级斗争、两条路线斗争的新特点、新动向、新问题，主动地不停顿地向阶级敌人发动进攻，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    象门合同志那样，为毛主席的革命路线放好哨，站好岗，打好仗
    门合同志光辉的一生，充满着誓死捍卫毛主席革命路线的无产阶级彻底革命精神。参加座谈的同志一致认为，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的时刻，就要象门合同志那样“时刻为毛主席的革命路线放好哨，站好岗，打好仗”，充分发挥革委会的战斗堡垒作用。
    参加座谈的同志认为，过去，在同资产阶级反动路线作殊死搏斗的时候，能不能把个人的一切置之度外，敢于顶逆风，战恶浪，誓死捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，这是对我们有没有誓死捍卫毛主席革命路线的彻底革命精神的考验。现在，我们从被压制变为掌权的地位，能不能坚持两条路线斗争，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，这是对我们有没有誓死捍卫毛主席革命路线的彻底革命精神的新的考验。他们说，革命委员会的成立，是我们的伟大胜利，是敌人的惨重失败。但是，阶级敌人的反动本性决定了他们在遭到失败以后必然要作垂死挣扎，从右的或极“左”方面来干扰和破坏毛主席的革命路线。我们应该象门合同志那样，以很高的阶级警惕性，为毛主席的无产阶级革命路线站好岗，放好哨，迅速而又准确地掌握阶级斗争的新动向，勇敢地和形形色色的阶级敌人进行斗争。有了这样的彻底革命精神，才能把革命进行到底。如果因为革命的胜利而麻痹懈怠，革命事业就会遭受损失。这是对毛主席的革命路线不忠。
    毛主席教导我们：“不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风，在路线问题上没有调和的余地。”大家认为：阶级斗争的客观规律总是不以人们的意志为转移的。我们不主动进攻敌人，敌人就要向我们进攻；我们攻得主动，敌人就不敢乱动。要在阶级斗争中取得主动权，就要象门合同志那样，时刻为捍卫毛主席的革命路线打好仗。我们的地位虽然随着革命的需要发生了变化，但是，敢于斗争的革命精神永远不能变。如果在掌权以后，“怕乱求稳”起来，不去主动进攻敌人，那就上了敌人的当，使阶级敌人有机可乘。大家认为，门合同志所以能时刻不停地为捍卫毛主席的革命路线而战斗，这是因为他把每一次胜利都看作是新的斗争的起点。只有这样，才能不断地夺取一个又一个新的胜利。“革命路上一歇脚就落后”。门合同志这句名言，是要求我们进一步发扬无产阶级彻底革命精神的告诫。
    参加座谈的同志说，为毛主席的革命路线打好仗，归根到底还是要打好自己头脑里破私立公的仗。在两条路线斗争中的“怕”字，反映在世界观上就是个“私”字。是为“公”还是为“私”，对毛主席是真忠还是假忠，都将在捍卫毛主席革命路线的战斗中受到严格检验。无私才能无畏。只有象门合同志那样，敢于向“我”字开火，敢于同“私”字搏斗，在头脑中树立一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大“公”，才能象门合同志那样，始终不渝地坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线一边，“时刻为毛主席的革命路线放好哨，站好岗，打好仗！”
    象门合同志那样，一刻也不脱离群众
    门合同志是密切联系群众的模范。他二十年来始终生活于群众之中，到了那里，就和那里的人民结合起来，发动群众为捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线而战斗。参加座谈的同志表示，要以门合同志为榜样，进一步加强和群众的联系，充分发挥群众的作用，把革命委员会建设成为革命化的密切联系群众的战斗指挥部。他们认为，能不能象门合同志那样一辈子保持和群众的密切联系，归根结底是如何对待群众的态度问题，是对待毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的根本态度问题。革命群众的代表参加了三结合的革命委员会，使无产阶级政权深深扎根于群众之中，这是三结合的革命委员会极大的优越性，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线在组织上的伟大胜利。毛主席教导我们：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”革委会建立以后，是走密切联系群众的道路，还是变成高高在上、脱离群众的官僚机构？这是在政权建设上的两条路线斗争，而斗争的焦点是如何对待群众的问题。大家一致表示，一定要遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，以门合同志为榜样，坚定地相信群众，依靠群众，充分发挥群众的作用，把革委会建设成为“革命化的联系群众的领导班子”，使无产阶级革命政权永远扎根于群众之中。如果不能正确地对待群众，不去积极地发挥群众的作用，势必脱离群众，那就不仅不能发挥三结合的革命委员会的优越性，而且会有变色的危险。
    为什么门合同志有密切联系群众的高度自觉性？大家认为，这是因为他把密切联系群众首先看成是战胜阶级敌人的必需，是捍卫毛主席革命路线的必需。他把自己比作革命的一兵一卒，因此他能在无产阶级文化大革命中，紧密地和革命人民站在一起，带领革命人民向阶级敌人进行英勇的斗争，为无产阶级文化大革命贡献自己的一切。大家认为，学习门合同志密切联系群众的革命精神，就要象他那样在尖锐、复杂的阶级斗争中，用毛泽东思想武装群众、发动群众，带领千百万群众主动地向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，发动大多数群众对一小撮阶级敌人实行无产阶级政党领导下的人民群众专政，发动群众对阶级敌人进行改造、监督。只有这样，才能巩固无产阶级政权。
    参加座谈的同志说，无产阶级革命政权要永不变色，就要象门合同志那样密切联系群众，发动群众经常对自己进行监督；革委会成员要永葆革命青春，也要象门合同志那样，深入于群众之中，向群众学习。
  “只有代表群众才能教育群众，只有做群众的学生才能做群众的先生。”只有深入群众，密切联系群众，才能听到群众的呼声，经受群众的批评、监督，从群众中吸取营养，并且把群众的意见、要求集中起来，坚持下去；才能真正代表群众的利益，适合人民的需要，受到广大群众的拥护和支持，使我们的无产阶级革命政权更加巩固。假如脱离了群众，失掉群众的批评和监督，那就有使自己变质的危险。
    象门合同志那样，永远坚定地紧跟伟大领袖毛主席
    在参加座谈的省革委会负责同志中，有的是跟随毛主席转战南北的老战士，有的是在无产阶级文化大革命中涌现出来的革命小将。他们认为，门合同志所以有捍卫毛主席无产阶级革命路线的自觉性，有向阶级敌人冲锋陷阵的无产阶级彻底革命性，有密切联系群众、甘当群众小学生的革命精神，归根结底，是因为他对伟大领袖毛主席、对战无不胜的毛泽东思想、对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线怀有一颗无限赤诚的红心。“一切紧跟毛主席”这七个闪闪发光的大字，高度概括了门合同志成长的光辉道路。大家认为，学英雄，就要象英雄那样，“一切紧跟毛主席”，步步紧跟毛主席，永远紧跟毛主席。
    大家回顾了两年来无产阶级文化大革命光辉的战斗历程，深深地体会到：紧跟毛主席就是胜利。革命委员会建立以后，革命的路程更长。要在今后长期的复杂的阶级斗争中永远站在毛主席的革命路线一边，永不掉队，就要永远紧跟毛主席。大家认为，站队问题决不是一劳永逸的。在社会主义时期尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，天天都在站队，一天不紧跟毛主席，就有可能站错队。只有天天紧跟毛主席，才能永葆革命青春。
    大家说，要做到永远紧跟毛主席，必须不断地把自己当作革命的对象，象门合同志那样，永远投身到两条路线斗争的火线上，革一辈子自己的命，改造一辈子思想。大家深有体会地说：阶级斗争的情况千变万化，只有在阶级斗争的风浪中狠学狠用毛主席的一系列最新指示和光辉的“老三篇”，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，彻底改造世界观，才能锤炼出一颗对毛主席的赤胆忠心，才能脚跟站得稳，是非分得清，方向辨得明，才能永远立足于毛主席的革命路线上，坚定地沿着伟大领袖毛主席指引的航向奋勇前进！
      座谈中，跟随毛主席身经百战的老战士和革命领导干部一致表示，一定要牢记毛主席的“不要吃老本，要立新功”的伟大教导，相信群众、相信党，正确对待自己，真正做到在两条路线斗争中永远紧跟毛主席，永远忠于毛主席。要永远使无产阶级的革命政权高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，真正把革命委员会建设成为无限忠于毛主席革命路线的战斗指挥部。
