An old worker from the Tianjin Hemp Textile Factory, Yu Zidi, posted a big-character poster criticizing the revolutionary committee for moving their office from a small room to a large one, calling it a "young master's attitude." As soon as the poster was put up, it attracted many people. Everyone was talking about it. Some said, "We workers love and protect the new revolutionary committee. Comrade Yu is right!" Others said, "It's not a big deal!"

Yu's criticism stirred up a struggle within the deputy head of the revolutionary committee, Zhou Guoliang. He went to the supporting soldiers from the People's Liberation Army and shared his thoughts. He said, "The revolutionary committee already has a full team. We can't work in a makeshift way anymore. Moving from the small room to the factory office is a necessity for our work. How can this be called a 'young master's attitude' or 'detachment from the masses'?"

The soldiers from the People's Liberation Army meaningfully told Zhou Guoliang, "Our revolutionary committee relies on Mao Zedong Thought from above and the masses from below. Comrade Yu's criticism is a show of concern for the revolutionary committee, helping it to take root among the masses and stay with the people forever. We should warmly welcome such criticism." Under the guidance of the soldiers, Zhou Guoliang carefully studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "We Communists are not seeking office but are seeking revolution. We must have a thorough revolutionary spirit. We must not be detached from the masses for even a moment. As long as we do not detach from the masses, we will definitely be victorious." Chairman Mao's words lit up Zhou Guoliang's heart. He recalled an incident from before. Once, during a meeting in Tianjin, Zhou Guoliang was invited to the stage. For this occasion, he bought a new set of clothes. After the meeting, he wore these new clothes to the workshop. On the way, he happened to meet Yu Zidi. Old Yu saw Zhou's attire and thought it didn't look like someone going to work in the workshop. He felt uncomfortable. Old Yu pulled at Zhou's sleeve and said sternly, "Zhou, don't forget your work clothes just because you've been on the stage!" He then gave Zhou his own worn-out cotton jacket and reminded him of the bitter history of oppression and exploitation by landlords and capitalists in the old society.

Zhou Guoliang increasingly felt that Yu Zidi genuinely cared about the growth of the new revolutionary committee. So, he posted a big-character poster to the entire factory, admitting his shortcomings and praising Old Yu's revolutionary spirit for caring about the new revolutionary committee.

The supporting soldiers from the People's Liberation Army seized this opportunity to study with all the members of the revolutionary committee. They studied Chairman Mao's "Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and the five conditions for being a successor to the proletarian revolutionary cause. They studied, compared, and examined themselves. The head of the revolutionary committee, Feng Junxiao, said, "Recently, some bad tendencies have emerged among the members of our revolutionary committee. There are more people sitting in offices and fewer people going to the masses; more people visiting workshops and fewer people participating in production; more people wearing clean clothes and fewer people wearing work clothes. Although these tendencies of detachment from the masses and labor are just beginning to show, they are a big problem. If we do not plug this ideological hole in time, bourgeois ideology will creep into our minds."

The next morning, the bright sunlight illuminated a small room of the revolutionary committee, making it particularly bright. The sign in front of the door with the words "Revolutionary Committee" shone brightly in the sunlight. The office of the revolutionary committee had moved back to the original small room of the revolutionary rebel headquarters. Workers came and went, and the room was filled with people. This small room had once again become the activity center for the entire factory.

    热情欢迎这样的批评
    天津市麻纺织厂老工人于子田，给厂革命委员会贴了一张大字报，批评革委会把办公室由小房子搬到大办公室是少爷作风。这张大字报刚一贴出，就吸引了不少人，大家议论纷纷，有的说：“我们工人最爱护新生的革命委员会，于师傅批评得对！”也有的说：“没嘛了不起的大事！”
    老于对革委会的批评，引起了革委会副主任周国良的思想斗争。他找到支左的解放军，亮了自己的活思想，他说：“革命委员会已经有了一整套人马，不能再象过去那样游击式的办公了，从原来的小房子搬到厂部办公室，这是工作的需要，怎么能说是少爷作风，脱离群众呢？”
    解放军同志意味深长地对周国良说：“咱们革命委员会就是上靠毛泽东思想，下靠群众。老于的批评是对革委会的爱护，是让革委会在群众里扎根，永远和群众在一起。我们应该热情欢迎这样的批评。”在解放军同志的启发下，周国良又认真学习了毛主席的教导：“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命，我们人人要有彻底的革命精神，我们不要有一时一刻脱离群众。只要我们不脱离群众，我们就一定会胜利。”毛主席的话象一盏明灯，把周国良的心照得通亮。他想起了前些时候发生的一件事。有一次，天津市召开了一次大会，周国良被请到主席台上。为了这次上主席台，他特意买了一身新衣服。开会回来，他穿着这身新衣服想到车间看看，路上正巧碰上了于子田。老于一看小周这一身打扮，根本不象到车间劳动的样子，心里就有些别扭。老于提起小周的衣角，严肃地说：“小周呀，你可不要上了主席台，忘掉了工作服啊！”说罢，就将自己的一件露了棉花的旧棉袄给小周穿上，又和小周一起回忆了旧社会受地主、资本家残酷压迫和剥削的悲惨历史。
    周国良越来越觉得于子田是打心眼里关心新生的革命委员会的成长。于是，他贴了一张大字报向全厂工人同志检讨自己的缺点。特别为老于关心新生革命委员会的革命精神叫好。
    支左的解放军同志，抓住这个问题，和全体革委会的委员一起进行了学习。他们学习了毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》、《为人民服务》和无产阶级革命事业接班人的五个条件。边学习，边对照，边检查。革委会主任冯俊晓说：“最近，在我们革委会成员身上，开始出现了一些不好的苗头，坐办公室的多了，深入群众的少了；到车间转转看看的多了，参加生产劳动的少了；穿干干净净衣服的多了，穿工作服的少了。虽然这些脱离群众、脱离劳动的现象刚露头，这可是一个大问题，如果我们不及时地堵住这个思想上的窟窿，资产阶级思想就会钻到我们头脑里来。”通过学习，大家体会到：新生的革命委员会，决不能掌了印把子，丢了锤把子，如果丢掉了锤把子，就意味着脱离了自己的阶级队伍，印把子就要被阶级敌人抢走。
    第二天清晨，灿烂的阳光把革委会的一间小房子照得格外明亮。门前牌子上“革命委员会”五个大字，在阳光下鲜红耀眼。革委会的办公室，又从厂部办公室搬回到原来革命造反总部的那间小房子里来了。工人们出出进进，屋里屋外挤满了人。这间小房子，又成了全厂工人的活动中心。
