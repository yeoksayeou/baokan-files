The Hangjiahu region, which has achieved a bumper harvest of spring cocoons, has seen its broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, with a broad perspective, eagerly selling basket after basket of spring silkworm cocoons to the state. In recent days, people from various places have carried portraits of Chairman Mao, beaten drums, and enthusiastically sent their pure white, high-quality cocoons to the procurement stations. In key sericulture areas such as Yuhang, Wuxing, and Deqing, most of the cocoons have already been stored, and many communes have overfulfilled the state's procurement plan.

Currently, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in this region are pressing ahead with the momentum of victory, striving for a bumper harvest of cocoons for the entire year. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    杭嘉湖社员踊跃交售春茧
    取得了春茧大丰收的杭嘉湖地区，广大贫下中农胸怀全局，把一担担春蚕茧踊跃售给国家。近日来，各地贫下中农抬着毛主席像，敲锣打鼓，把雪白的好茧送往收购站。余杭、吴兴、德清等重点养蚕区的蚕茧大部分已入库，许多公社已超额完成了国家计划收购任务。
    现在，这个地区的广大贫下中农和革命干部，正在乘胜前进，争取全年蚕茧生产丰收。（据新华社讯）
