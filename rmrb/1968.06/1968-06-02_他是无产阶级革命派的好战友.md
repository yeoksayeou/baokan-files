He is a Good Comrade of the Revolutionary Masses of the Proletariat
The Twenty-Seven Revolutionary Masses Saved by Comrade Men He

We twenty-seven comrades were saved by Comrade Men He with his life and blood. We are grateful to the hero Men He, and even more grateful to the greatest leader Chairman Mao. It is only the invincible Mao Zedong Thought that can nurture such selfless and fearless heroes of the people like Men He; it is only the people's army personally created by the great leader Chairman Mao that can cultivate such good cadres as Men He.

September 5 last year is a day we will never forget. Comrade Men He, who was supporting the leftists in our unit, in order to resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production," led us in setting up soil rockets to drive away clouds and prevent hail, determined to achieve a bumper harvest in agriculture.

Setting up soil rockets is a dangerous task. Comrade Men He, following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, "the more difficult the place, the more we must go," took on the most dangerous tasks from the beginning. He saw Comrade Shi Zhengduan holding a small shovel mixing explosives, and immediately went over to replace him, saying in a firm voice of a soldier of the people who is willing to take on the most arduous tasks, "This is dangerous, I'll do it!" He took the shovel and carefully mixed and refined the explosives. When he saw a comrade starting to load the explosives into the rocket tube, he went over to replace him, still with that simple yet powerful phrase: "This is dangerous, I'll do it!" He carefully loaded the explosives. He was always doing the most dangerous work, always staying in the place closest to the explosives, always thinking of others' safety. Just as everyone was concentrating on their work, suddenly the explosives exploded unexpectedly. At this critical moment, Comrade Men He, to protect us, threw himself towards the explosives and heroically sacrificed his life!

The hero sacrificed himself to save us and died a martyr. How can we forget the days we spent together!

Comrade Men He often said, "Revolution for a lifetime, support the leftists for a lifetime!" On the day after Chairman Mao issued the great call for the People's Liberation Army to support the broad masses of the leftists, the "August 18" proletarian revolutionary faction in our unit rose up to seize back the leadership that had been usurped by a handful of capitalist roaders within the party. After hearing this good news, Comrade Men He specially rushed from the army to the farm to express his congratulations. He was extremely excited and told the comrades of the "August 18" proletarian revolutionary faction, "This power is seized well, seized correctly, we firmly support it!" When a handful of capitalist roaders and bad leaders in the unit tried to stage a counter-coup, Comrade Men He again firmly stood on the side of the "August 18" proletarian revolutionary faction, giving those elements a powerful rebuke. Comrade Men He's support greatly boosted the morale of the proletarian revolutionary faction and struck a heavy blow to the arrogance of the capitalist roaders within the party. In the days when the class enemy launched a counterrevolutionary tide, Comrade Men He fearlessly stood with us, encouraging us to uphold the truth and continue the struggle. He fought side by side with the "August 18" fighters, resolutely smashed the fierce counterattacks of the class enemy, helped us develop and strengthen the revolutionary leftist forces, and made the Cultural Revolution in the farm a resounding success. Comrades all said, "Comrade Men He is a good comrade and good strategist of the proletarian revolutionary faction."

Comrade Men He not only resolutely carried out and bravely defended Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, but also actively organized us to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, helping us to raise our awareness of the struggle between the two lines. He often said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution to remold people's souls with Mao Zedong Thought. To ensure that the country never changes color, we must not only seize the power from the handful of capitalist roaders within the party but also fiercely seize the power of the 'self' in our minds, and in the great winds and waves of class struggle, raise our awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines." One of our comrades, in the fierce struggle between the two lines, was once deceived by a handful of capitalist roaders within the party and stood on the wrong side. After Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee rectified the "August 18" for us, this comrade was still worried and depressed. Comrade Men He, knowing this, with deep proletarian feelings, often had individual talks with him, studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles" together, and patiently helped him analyze the reasons for standing on the wrong side, inspiring him to consciously break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness. Through Comrade Men He's enthusiastic help, this comrade raised his proletarian awareness, recognized the reactionary nature of the capitalist reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev, and quickly returned to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, joining the "August 18" revolutionary mass organization.

Comrade Men He sacrificed his life to carry out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and protect the lives of us twenty-seven comrades. His image of unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, unlimited loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and selflessness for the revolution and the people will forever live in our hearts and forever encourage us to follow the great leader Chairman Mao to the end of the revolution.

After Comrade Men He's sacrifice, we twenty-seven people formed a "Men He Combat Team," following the "Daily Reading" system that Comrade Men He established for us, studying Chairman Mao's works more diligently, and sparking a revolution in our souls. We are determined to inherit the will of the martyr Men He, walk the path of heroes, and become proletarian revolutionaries who are determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    他是无产阶级革命派的好战友
    被门合同志救护的二十七名革命群众
    我们二十七个同志，是被门合同志用生命和鲜血救护出来的。我们感激英雄门合，更感激最伟大的领袖毛主席。因为只有战无不胜的毛泽东思想，才能哺育出门合这样无私无畏的人民英雄；只有伟大领袖毛主席亲自缔造的人民军队，才能培养出门合这样的好干部。
    去年九月五日，是我们终生难忘的日子。在我们场里支左的门合同志，为了坚决贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，带领我们装置驱云防雹的土火箭，决心夺取农业大丰收。
    装置土火箭，是一项有危险性的工作。门合同志按照伟大领袖毛主席“越是困难的地方越是要去”的教导，从一开始就亲自担任最危险的工序。他看见史正端同志拿着小铲搅拌炸药，立即走过去接替他，并且用人民战士勇于承担最艰巨任务的坚定口气说：“这危险，我来干！”他接过小铲，轻轻地把炸药拌匀捻细。当他看见一个同志开始往火箭管里装炸药时，他又走上去接替这个同志，还是那句朴实而有力的话：“这危险，我来干！”他又细心地装起炸药来。他就是这样，始终做着最危险的工作，始终呆在离炸药最近的地点，始终想着别人的安全。正当大家聚精会神地工作的时候，猛然间炸药发生了意外的爆炸。在这千钧一发的时刻，门合同志为了掩护我们，向炸药猛扑上去，英勇地献出了自己的生命！
    英雄为救护我们壮烈地牺牲了，我们怎能忘记和他朝夕相处的那些日子！
    门合同志常说：“干一辈子革命，支持一辈子左派！”在毛主席发出“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召的第二天，我们场里“八·一八”无产阶级革命派奋起夺回了被党内一小撮走资派篡夺的领导权。门合同志听到这个喜讯以后，特地从部队赶来农场表示祝贺。他万分兴奋地对“八·一八”无产阶级革命派的同志说：“这个权夺得好，夺对了，我们坚决支持！”当场里一小撮走资派和坏头头妄想搞反夺权的时候，门合同志又坚决站在“八·一八”无产阶级革命派一边，给了那些家伙有力的回击。门合同志的支持，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭了党内走资派的威风。在阶级敌人掀起反革命逆流的日子里，门合同志不畏强暴，坚定不移地和我们站在一起，鼓励我们坚持真理，坚持斗争。他和“八·一八”战士并肩战斗，坚决粉碎了阶级敌人的疯狂反扑，帮助我们发展壮大革命左派队伍，把农场的无产阶级文化大革命搞得轰轰烈烈。同志们都说：“门合同志是我们无产阶级革命派的好战友、好参谋。”
    门合同志不仅自己坚决执行、英勇捍卫毛主席的革命路线，而且积极组织我们活学活用毛主席著作，帮助我们提高两条路线斗争觉悟。他常说：“无产阶级文化大革命，就是用毛泽东思想改造人的灵魂的大革命。为了使国家永不变颜色，我们不但要夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，还要狠夺自己头脑中
  ‘私’字的权，在阶级斗争的大风大浪里，提高自己的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。”我们当中的一位同志，在两条路线的激烈搏斗中，曾经一度受了党内一小撮走资派的蒙蔽，站错了队。毛主席和党中央给我们“八·一八”平反以后，这位同志又顾虑重重，情绪低沉。门合同志知道后，便怀着深厚的无产阶级感情，经常和他个别谈心，共同学习“老三篇”，耐心地帮助他分析站错队的原因，启发他自觉地破私立公。经过门合同志的热情帮助，这位同志提高了无产阶级觉悟，认清了中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线的反动本质，很快回到毛主席的革命路线上来，参加了“八·一八”革命群众组织。
    门合同志为了贯彻毛主席的革命路线，保护我们二十七个同志的生命英勇地牺牲了。他那无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，一心为革命，一心为人民的英雄形象，将永远活在我们的心里，将永远鼓励着我们紧跟伟大统帅毛主席革命到底。
    门合同志牺牲后，我们二十七个人组成一个“门合战斗队”，按照门合同志生前为我们建立起的“天天读”的制度，更加刻苦地活学活用毛主席著作，在灵魂深处爆发革命，决心继承门合烈士的遗志，走英雄的道路，做一个“决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派”。
