Shanghai Maritime Bureau's broad masses of workers earnestly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, carry out revolutionary criticism, and resolutely strike down a handful of class enemies. From January to May, they consecutively overfulfilled the state's transportation plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 16 — Under the enthusiastic assistance of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support personnel, the broad revolutionary masses of workers at Shanghai Maritime Bureau earnestly implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, vigorously grasp class struggle, and promote transportation production to new heights. In the first five months of this year, this bureau consecutively and comprehensively overfulfilled the state's transportation plan, and each month's completion was better than the last: May's cargo volume exceeded the original plan by more than 13 percent; the cargo volume in the first half of June again showed a significant increase compared to the same period in May.

Shanghai Maritime Bureau is an important department in maritime transportation. The ships of this bureau operate in the East China Sea, Yellow Sea, and Bohai Sea, passing through the coastal provinces of Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shandong, Hebei, Liaoning, and the municipalities of Shanghai and Tianjin. Over the past decade since liberation, a handful of capitalist roaders within the party have shielded and promoted a group of traitors and spies, the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and crazily pushed the revisionist line, attempting to restore capitalism in this important maritime transportation department. After the revolutionary masses seized power, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support personnel, they united the revolutionary workers of the entire bureau to launch a powerful offensive against the class enemies. After the revolutionary committee was established, it led the broad revolutionary masses of the entire bureau to resolutely strike down a handful of class enemies within the unit. At the same time, it thoroughly exposed and criticized the revisionist garbage spread by China's Khrushchev and his agents in the maritime system, further raising the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary masses.

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary masses promoted the revolutionization of their thinking. They directed the boundless enthusiasm ignited during the Cultural Revolution into production. After criticizing the revisionist garbage such as "material incentives" and "survival philosophy" pushed by China's Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, they further carried forward the spirit of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people. In the past, ships that needed repairs had to be sent to shipyards for repairs. Now, the sailors, in order to save costs and set sail as soon as possible, fear no hardships and fatigue, give up rest, and try their best to repair the ships themselves. The "Dagang No. 1" ship had two voyages with insufficient manpower. The crew realized that striving for more voyages and more cargo not only has significant economic implications but also significant political implications. Thus, they united as one, overcame difficulties, and finally successfully completed the voyage mission. The "Battle No. 21" ship once went to rescue a stranded foreign ship, with its own ship's ropes almost completely broken. At this critical moment, the crew members displayed the fearless revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, and together with the brother units, fought for fourteen days and nights, finally rescuing the stranded foreign ship, and singing another resounding song of Mao Zedong Thought.

Through revolutionary criticism, the revisionist garbage such as "profit-first" and "target-first" spread by China's Khrushchev and his agents were cleared away. The broad revolutionary masses resolutely ensured that all key materials urgently needed by the state were transported first. For example, coal was not a welcomed transportation material by a handful of capitalist roaders within the party in the past. Now, the broad revolutionary sailors place coal transportation in an important position and use their brains to rationally dispatch, adopting the method of comprehensive utilization of large and medium-sized ships, striving to transport more and faster, and ensuring that coal does not pile up in cars and ports, meeting the needs of Shanghai's industrial production.

    狠抓阶级斗争有力地推动运输生产
    上海海运局广大职工认真落实毛主席的最新指示，开展革命大批判，坚决打击一小撮阶级敌人，一至五月连续超额完成国家运输计划
    新华社上海十六日电　上海海运局广大革命职工在人民解放军支左人员热情帮助下，认真落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，狠抓阶级斗争，推动运输生产蒸蒸日上。今年头五个月，这个局连续全面超额完成了国家运输计划，而且一月比一月完成得好：五月份货运量比原订计划超过百分之十三以上；六月上半月的货运量，又比五月份同期有较大幅度的增长。
    上海海运局是海上运输的重要部门。这个局的船舶行使在东海、黄海和渤海上，经过福建、浙江、江苏、山东、河北、辽宁、上海、天津等沿海六省两市。解放十几年来，党内一小撮走资派，包庇重用一批叛徒、特务等国民党反动派的残渣余孽，疯狂推行修正主义路线，妄图在这个重要的海上运输部门复辟资本主义。无产阶级革命派夺权以后，在解放军支左人员的帮助下，团结全局革命职工，主动向阶级敌人发动了强大的攻势。革命委员会成立以后，带领全局广大革命职工坚决打击本单位的一小撮阶级敌人，同时对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在海运系统所散布的修正主义黑货，进行了深入系统的揭发和批判，进一步提高了广大革命职工的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。
    广大革命职工在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中促进了思想的革命化，他们把在文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲用到了生产上。他们批判了中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派推行的“物质刺激”、“活命哲学”等反革命修正主义黑货以后，进一步发扬了“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的精神。过去，需要修理的船舶一向要送到修船工厂去修，现在海员们为了节约费用和尽快出航，不怕困难，不怕疲劳，放弃休息，尽可能自己设法修理。“大庆一号”轮有两次出航，人手不够。船员们认识到，争取多出航多运货，不仅有重大经济意义，而且有重大政治意义，于是便同心协力，克服困难，终于胜利完成了出航任务。“战斗二十一号”轮有一次去抢救一艘触礁的外轮，自己船的缆绳几乎全部断裂。在这关键时刻，船员们发扬无产阶级的大无畏革命精神，同兄弟单位一起奋战十四昼夜，终于救出了触礁的外轮，奏出了又一曲光芒四射的毛泽东思想凯歌。
    通过革命大批判，清算了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所散布的“利润挂帅”、“指标第一”等修正主义黑货，广大革命职工坚决做到了凡是国家急需的重点物资都尽先装运。例如煤炭过去是不受党内一小撮走资派欢迎的运输物资，现在，广大革命海员把运煤放在重要地位，并且开动脑筋，合理调度，采取大、中型船舶综合利用的办法，争取运得多、运得快，力争做到煤不压车，港不积煤，保证上海工业生产的需要。
