Albania is vigorously developing agricultural and pastoral production in mountainous and hilly regions. Agricultural and pastoral workers in these regions are receiving active support from people across the country.

Tens of thousands of young men and women, urban residents, and members of agricultural cooperatives from the plains have already gone to, or are on their way to, mountainous and hilly regions to participate in land reclamation with members of local agricultural cooperatives. In the first four months of this year, they have reclaimed 14,200 hectares of land, completing 56 percent of the annual reclamation plan. Various crops such as potatoes, tobacco, and corn have already been planted on these newly reclaimed lands.

State farms and agricultural cooperatives in the plains have begun transporting the first batch of livestock to remote highland agricultural cooperatives, some of which have already arrived at their destinations. Members of agricultural cooperatives in remote highland regions such as Shkodër, Mirditë, Tropojë, Kukës, and Pukë are using these livestock to crossbreed with local livestock to develop new breeds of cattle and sheep, rapidly developing the livestock industry, and turning highland regions into important bases for supplying milk and meat.

This initiative to supply livestock to highland agricultural cooperatives was proposed by agricultural cooperatives and state farms in the plains such as Fier, and has received a widespread response across the country.

In addition, there are many other initiatives and actions to support highland regions, reflecting the mutual aid and unity among Albanian workers and their high level of socialist political awareness. Young men and women from highland agricultural cooperatives are also going to the plains to learn production management experiences there.

At the same time, the state is prioritizing the provision of agricultural machinery and fertilizers to highland agricultural cooperatives to help them develop transportation. For newly established agricultural cooperatives in these regions, the state is also providing interest-free loans.

    阿尔巴尼亚大力发展山区农牧业
    大批男女青年和城市居民奔赴山区参加垦荒
    据新华社讯　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道，阿尔巴尼亚正在大力发展山区和丘陵地区的农牧业生产，这些地区的农牧业劳动者得到全国各地人民的积极支援。
    阿尔巴尼亚成千上万的青年男女、城市居民和平原地区的农业合作社社员，已经和正在奔赴山区和丘陵地区，同那里的农业合作社社员一起参加垦荒运动。今年头四个月中，他们已经开荒一万四千二百公顷，完成了年度开荒计划的百分之五十六。在这些新开垦的土地上已种上了土豆、烟草、玉米等作物。
    阿尔巴尼亚的国营农场和平原地区的农业合作社，已开始运送他们决定向边远高原地区农业合作社供应的第一批牲畜，这些牲畜中的一部分已经运到目的地。斯库台、米尔迪塔、特罗波雅、库克斯和普克等边远高原地区的农业合作社社员正在用这些牲畜和当地牲畜交配，以培育出新品种的牛羊群，迅速发展畜牧业，把高原地区变成牛奶和肉类的重要供应基地。
    这个向高原地区农业合作社供应牲畜的革命倡议是发罗拉等平原地区的农业合作社和国营农场提出的，得到全国各地的普遍响应。
    此外，还有很多支援高原地区的倡议和行动，体现了阿尔巴尼亚劳动人民之间的互助团结和他们的高度的社会主义政治觉悟。高原地区的农业合作社的男女青年也纷纷到平原地区，学习那里的生产管理经验。
    与此同时，国家也优先向高原地区的农业合作社提供农业机械、化肥，帮助它们发展交通运输。对于这些地区新建的农业合作社，国家还给以无息贷款。
