The criticism of revolutionary masses is care

The revolutionary committee of Chengdu Canning Factory discovered that a path in the workers' dormitory was inconvenient for workers to commute, so they specially sent people to bring more than ten concrete pipes to pave the road. The masses responded strongly, and more than ten big-character posters were pasted overnight, questioning: "Using state concrete pipes to pave the road, what kind of thinking is this?"

Some members of the revolutionary committee, after seeing the big-character posters, thought that the masses were not considerate and that their criticisms were too sharp. Although using state concrete pipes to pave the road was wrong, it was also for everyone. The PLA cadre stationed in the factory to support the left organized the members of the revolutionary committee to study Chairman Mao's teachings repeatedly: "Because we are serving the people, we should not be afraid of others pointing out our shortcomings. No matter who it is, as long as you point it out correctly, we will correct it. If your method is beneficial to the people, we will do it as you say." In the end, everyone reached a consensus: the masses' criticisms were very correct and hit the mark. Using state concrete pipes to pave the road in the workers' dormitory seemed to be for everyone, but in reality, it was an enlarged "selfishness." If this kind of thinking is not overcome, the revolutionary committee cannot lead the entire factory's revolutionary masses on the path indicated by Chairman Mao, and it cannot keep the revolutionary committee forever red. The masses' sharp criticisms reflect the high sense of responsibility of the broad revolutionary masses in running the country as masters, and reflect the supervisory role of the revolutionary masses over the revolutionary committee. This is a care and help for the revolutionary committee.

The chairman and vice-chairman of the revolutionary committee made a profound self-criticism at the staff meeting and immediately returned the concrete pipes to their original place. The revolutionary committee's spirit of daring to correct mistakes was praised by the masses. Many workers said: "Our revolutionary committee listens to Chairman Mao's words, corrects mistakes when they are made, and we trust them."

To be able to listen to the masses' opinions and accept the masses' supervision, and to continuously strengthen the connection with the masses, the factory revolutionary committee also specially formulated measures to revolutionize the connection with the masses: the members of the revolutionary committee insist on going to the workshops every day to read with the workers, to expose and struggle with their own shortcomings; the revolutionary committee spends half a day every week to study and analyze the masses' opinions, learn from Chairman Mao's works according to their own problems, sweep away the dust of being detached from the masses, and make the revolutionary committee deeply rooted among the masses.

    革命群众的批评是爱护
    成都市罐头厂革委会发现工人宿舍有条路不好走，工人上班很不方便，就专门派人拉了十多根水泥管子来铺路。群众反映很大，一晚上就贴出了十多张大字报，质问：“把国家的水泥管子拿来铺路，这是什么思想？”
    革委会个别委员看了大字报以后，认为群众不讲情面，意见太尖锐。拿国家水泥管子铺路虽然不对，但也是为大家。解放军驻厂支左人员就组织革委会成员带着这个问题，反复学习毛主席的教导：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。只要你说得对，我们就改正。你说的办法对人民有好处，我们就照你的办。”最后，大家统一了认识：群众提的意见非常正确，打中了要害。拿国家的水泥管子给工人宿舍铺路，看来是为大家，实际上是放大了的“私”字。这种思想不克服，革委会就不能领导全厂革命群众走毛主席指引的道路，就不能使革委会永远保持鲜红的颜色。群众提出尖锐的批评，体现了广大革命群众当家作主的高度责任感，体现了革命群众对革委会的广泛监督作用，这是对革命委员会的爱护和帮助。
    革委会主任委员、副主任委员到职工大会上作了深刻的自我批评，立即把水泥管子送回了原处。革委会这种勇于改正错误的精神，受到群众的好评。不少职工说：“我们的革委会听毛主席的话，有了错误就改，我们信得过。”
    为了能经常听取群众意见，接受群众监督，不断加强与群众的联系，厂革委会还专门制定了联系群众的革命化措施：革委会成员坚持每天下车间和工人一块天天读，一块亮私斗私；革委会每周用半天时间，研究分析群众的意见，针对自己的问题学习毛主席著作，扫除脱离群众的灰尘，使革命委员会深深扎根于群众之中。　卫东战
