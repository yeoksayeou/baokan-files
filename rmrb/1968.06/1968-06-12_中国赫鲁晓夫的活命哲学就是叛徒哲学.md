The philosophy of survival of the Chinese Khrushchev is the philosophy of a traitor. Comrade Men He, in order to protect twenty-seven class brothers, wrote a heroic song with his life, a song that is magnificent and resonates through the clouds. Comrade Men He's heroic deed of sacrificing his life for the people and his heroic spirit have thoroughly criticized and exposed the stench of the Chinese Khrushchev's philosophy of survival.

The Chinese Khrushchev, as an agent of the landlord class, the bourgeoisie, and the reactionary Kuomintang, has long been madly preaching the philosophy of survival. In his view, the struggle of life is "a constant struggle with death, a continuous overcoming of death"; otherwise, if people die, what use is there for principles? This is very similar to the shameless words of Khrushchev and his ilk, such as "losing one's head, what good is the cause?" "Living is everything," "everything for living," "it is better to live miserably than to die well"—this is the reactionary philosophy of survival of the Chinese Khrushchev. The Chinese Khrushchev always cherishes "loving oneself, protecting one's life and health"; for the sake of survival, he has repeatedly and shamelessly betrayed the fundamental interests of the proletariat, bowing and scraping, kneeling before the Japanese invaders and the reactionary Kuomintang. He also directed some people in enemy prisons to surrender and betray the party, and later colluded with them, forming cliques and engaging in factionalism. It is clear that the Chinese Khrushchev's philosophy of survival is the philosophy of a traitor, serving his counter-revolutionary revisionist political line of usurping the party, the army, and the government, and restoring capitalism.

To wholeheartedly serve the people is the sole purpose of us proletarian revolutionaries. "To be the 'ox' of the proletariat and the masses, to devote oneself to the end, and to die only then." This is the view of life and death of us proletarian revolutionaries. Countless revolutionary martyrs, to defend Comrade Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line, dared to climb mountains of knives and leap into seas of fire. When the revolution needs it, they bravely sacrificed their lives. Comrade Men He is a prominent example among them.

Comrade Men He, following the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, had made a steel oath in his lifetime: "To live for the people, to die for the people." To firmly defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, over the years, he has repeatedly shown the spirit of fearlessness and self-sacrifice of a communist. In 1953, when he was a courier, he drove a motorcycle to deliver documents. At a sharp turn, he suddenly saw a person riding a bicycle ahead. At this critical moment, Men He, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and with deep love for the people, did not hesitate and forcefully threw the motorcycle to the right, ensuring the bicyclist's safety, but his right arm and head were injured and bleeding. When he was a platoon leader, he once patrolled in the suburbs of Tianjin. After a heavy rain, the river water surged and broke through the embankment. He immediately jumped into the water and used his body to block the breach, protecting the road and hundreds of acres of crops. In 1962, as a political instructor, during a live-fire exercise, a soldier accidentally threw a grenade only five meters away from himself. In this critical moment, Men He fearlessly jumped out of the cover and threw himself on the soldier, protecting the safety of his class brother. During the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Comrade Men He followed Chairman Mao's great battle call, firmly supporting the broad leftist masses, "grasp the revolution and promote production." To protect the people's labor achievements, he and the revolutionary masses of Baqiang Farm together set up soil rockets to drive away clouds and prevent hail. Comrade Men He, whose entire life was dedicated to the interests of the people, personally took on the most dangerous task of setting up explosives. Suddenly, the explosives exploded unexpectedly. Men He, facing danger without fear, rushed towards the explosives, using his blood and life to protect the safety of the twenty-seven class brothers present.

To die for the people is glorious even in death. Comrade Men He is indeed a good cadre who is determined to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Comrade Men He's fighting life has set a brilliant example for us, and it is another crushing blow to the philosophy of survival of the Chinese Khrushchev.

Comrade Men He has also left us many heroic words shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought on the issue of how to face life and death. He said: "For a revolutionary, the issue of life and death is an extremely important matter. Living for the revolution, life is as heavy as Mount Tai; living for oneself, it is not worth a needle." "Whether one fears hardship or death is the dividing line between true and false revolutionaries. All true revolutionaries are fearless of hardship and death. All false revolutionaries are cowards who fear hardship and death." Comrade Men He's heroic deeds and advanced thoughts embody the great heroic spirit of the proletarian revolutionaries, which is so pure and noble, so moving! While the Chinese Khrushchev, with his extremely reactionary and extremely decadent life philosophy of the exploiting class, "a lifetime of wealth is hard to come by, why not enjoy oneself while one can," this worm who is willing to surrender to the enemy for the sake of survival, compared to the heroic image of Comrade Men He and other martyrs who are willing to sacrifice their lives for the cause of revolution, is how small, how despicable!

"For the sake of sacrifice, there is great ambition, daring to let the sun and moon shine a new sky." The victory of the Chinese revolution is won by countless revolutionary martyrs who have shed their blood and sacrificed their lives. Proletarian revolutionaries are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, they are the tough bones, they are the heroes who look down on all the villains and cowards in the world. Let the Chinese Khrushchev and his philosophy of survival go to hell!

    中国赫鲁晓夫的活命哲学就是叛徒哲学
    第二炮兵司令部  高泽旗
    门合同志为了保护二十七名阶级兄弟，用生命谱写了一曲气壮山河、响彻云霄的毛泽东思想的凯歌。门合同志为人民视死如归的壮烈行为和英雄气概，把中国赫鲁晓夫的活命哲学批判得臭不可闻。
    中国赫鲁晓夫这个地主、资产阶级、国民党反动派的代理人，长期以来，疯狂鼓吹活命哲学。在他看来，人生的斗争就是“一直和死斗争着，就是死的不断克服”，否则人都死了，原则还有什么用呢？这同赫鲁晓夫之流所宣扬的“丢了脑袋，主义还有什么好处”等无耻谰言，何其相似乃尔！“活着就是一切”，“一切为了活着”，“好死不如赖活着”，这就是中国赫鲁晓夫的反动的活命哲学。中国赫鲁晓夫念念不忘“钟爱自己，保护自己的生命与健康”；为了活命，他先后多次无耻地出卖无产阶级的根本利益，卑躬屈节，拜倒在日寇和国民党反动派的脚下。他还指使在敌人监狱里的一些人自首叛党，以后又同他们狼狈为奸，结党营私。十分清楚，中国赫鲁晓夫的活命哲学就是叛徒哲学，是为其篡党、篡军、篡政，复辟资本主义的反革命修正主义政治路线服务的。
    全心全意地为人民服务，这就是我们无产阶级革命战士唯一的宗旨。“做无产阶级和人民大众的‘牛’，鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已。”这就是我们无产阶级革命战士的生死观。无数的革命先烈，为了捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，刀山敢上，火海敢闯，当革命需要的时候，勇敢地献出了自己的生命。门合同志就是其中突出的一个。
    门合同志遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，在生前就立下了“生为人民生，死为人民死”的钢铁誓言。为了坚决捍卫毛主席的革命路线，多年来，他一次又一次表现了不怕牺牲，勇于献身的共产主义精神。一九五三年当通信员的时候，他驾驶摩托车去送文件，在急转弯时，突然发现前面一个骑自行车的人，在这千钧一发之际，用毛泽东思想武装起来的、对人民高度热爱的门合同志，毫不迟疑，猛力把摩托车向右摔倒，使骑车的人安然脱险，而自己的右臂和头部负伤流血。他当排长的时候，一次在天津郊区执勤，发现暴雨后河水猛涨，冲破了渠岸，便毫不犹豫地跳进水里，用身子堵住缺口，保护了公路和几百亩庄稼。一九六二年，他当指导员，一次实弹演习，一个战士不慎把手榴弹投在离自己只有五米远的地方，在这危急的时刻，门合同志奋不顾身，跳出掩体，扑在这个战士的身上，保护了阶级兄弟的安全。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，门合同志遵照毛主席的伟大战斗号令，坚决地支持左派广大群众，“抓革命，促生产”，为了保护人民的劳动成果，他和巴仓农场的革命群众一起，装置驱云防雹的土火箭。“生命的全部时间都是为人民利益而工作”的门合同志，亲自担任最危险的装置炸药的工作。突然炸药意外爆炸，门合同志临危不惧，向炸药扑去，用自己的鲜血和生命，保护了在场的二十七位阶级兄弟的安全。
    为人民而死，虽死犹荣。门合同志不愧为誓死捍卫毛主席革命路线的好干部。门合同志战斗的一生，为我们树立了光辉的榜样，对中国赫鲁晓夫的活命哲学是又一次粉碎性的打击。
    门合同志在怎样对待生死的问题上，还为我们留下了许多闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的豪言壮语。他说：“一个革命战士对待生死问题是一个极端重要的问题。活着为革命，生命泰山重；活着为个人，不如一颗针”。“怕不怕苦，怕不怕死，是区别真假革命的分界线。一切真革命者，都是不怕苦、不怕死的。所有假革命者，都是怕苦怕死的胆小鬼。”门合同志的英雄行为和先进思想，体现了无产阶级革命者大无畏的英雄气概，这是何等的纯洁高尚，何等的可歌可泣啊！而中国赫鲁晓夫这个抱着“一生富贵何可期，胡不及时以行乐”的极端反动、极端腐朽的剥削阶级人生哲学的家伙，这个为了活命而不惜向敌人投降的软骨虫，同门合等先烈为了革命的利益而视死如归的英雄形象相比，是何等的渺小，何等的卑鄙！
    “为有牺牲多壮志，敢教日月换新天”。中国革命的胜利，是无数革命先烈，抛头颅，洒热血，英勇牺牲换来的。无产阶级革命战士，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的硬骨头，是傲视人间一切蟊贼懦夫的英雄汉。让中国赫鲁晓夫连同他的活命哲学见鬼去吧！
