The Indonesian fascist military regime of Suharto and Nasution, in a situation of internal and external difficulties, has intensified its betrayal of national interests and state sovereignty. It has allowed the monopolistic capital of imperialist countries, led by the United States, to pour into Indonesia, plundering Indonesia's resources and exploiting the blood and sweat of the Indonesian people.

After a series of betrayals of national interests and state sovereignty last year, the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime has, since the beginning of this year, even more openly auctioned off Indonesia's oil, forests, minerals, industry, fisheries, banking, and transportation sectors. According to reports, the regime's Ministry of Mines announced at the end of last year that it would allow foreign monopolistic capitalists to develop the mineral resources of "broad areas of Indonesia that were previously little known." In March of this year, the regime's Ministry of Basic Industries, Light Industries, and Power decided to open up oil, rubber, fertilizer, chemical machinery, aircraft assembly, and gas equipment industries to foreign monopolistic capitalists. At the same time, the Indonesian fascist military regime has handed over half of the developable forests in Indonesia to sixty foreign capitalists for logging. It has also approved twelve banks from the United States, Britain, Japan, and the Netherlands to operate in Indonesia, creating conditions for foreign capital to control Indonesia's finance. This fascist military regime has recently returned the plantations in Sumatra, previously managed by the Belgian and Swiss governments, to their original owners. Since this regime came to power two years ago, it has already returned twenty enterprises from the United States, Britain, West Germany, Belgium, and Switzerland to their original owners.

Currently, foreign monopolistic capitalists are rushing into Indonesia. According to an official of the Indonesian fascist military regime in January, there are more than a hundred instances of foreign monopolistic capital prepared to invest in Indonesia in 1968.

The U.S. imperialists are the chief culprits in plundering and exploiting the Indonesian people. Among the foreign capital that has invaded Indonesia this year, whether in terms of investment amount or project scope, the United States holds an absolute majority. According to reports, by the end of March, the Indonesian puppet regime had approved $101.7 million in U.S. investments, accounting for more than 70% of the total foreign investment. U.S. monopolistic capital has seized the copper mines in West Irian and is building a copper processing plant, a special highway, an airport, and a port there. U.S. monopolistic capital, in collusion with the reactionary local government in Sumatra, is developing and plundering the oil in Sumatra. The Canadian International Nickel Company, which is majority-owned by U.S. capitalists, has seized the nickel mines in South Sulawesi. This company is building a processing plant, a hydroelectric power station, and a special port there. U.S. monopolistic capital, in collusion with Japanese, Philippine, and South Korean capitalists, is dividing up the vast forests of Kalimantan. Among the twelve foreign banks approved to operate in Indonesia in February of this year, five belong to U.S. monopolistic capital.

The Japanese monopolistic capitalist group, a faithful lackey of U.S. imperialism in Asia, has long coveted Indonesia's rich natural resources and is full of ambition. After the reactionary leaders of the United States and Japan, Johnson and Sato, conspired to plunder Indonesia at the end of last year, Japanese monopolistic capital has even more brazenly infiltrated Indonesia's oil, agriculture, forestry, and fisheries resources.

The Indonesian fascist military clique is a group of traitors who have sold out Indonesia's national interests and state sovereignty. They have slavishly signed agreements with U.S. imperialism to guarantee the safety of U.S. monopolistic capital investments and have issued one decree after another to open the doors wide for foreign monopolistic capital to pour into Indonesia, handing over Indonesia's rich resources to foreign monopolistic capital. The Indonesian fascist regime has also sent one official delegation after another abroad to beg for aid and invite foreign monopolistic capital to invade Indonesia. On the day after the head of this fascist military clique, Suharto, seized the "presidential" throne by force, he rushed to Japan to beg the Japanese reactionary government for alms and investments. He shamelessly said that his regime has stipulated various tax exemptions for foreign enterprises, "paving the way for foreign monopolistic capital to invest in Indonesia's industry." He slavishly told the Japanese monopolistic capitalists that Indonesia "can serve as a supplier of raw materials to Japan" and "can become a good market for Japanese products." Suharto's despicable actions have exposed his traitorous face and also revealed the desperate plight of the Indonesian fascist military regime.

    印尼法西斯军人政权引狼入室罪恶深重
    苏哈托竟无耻宣扬要为外国垄断资本涌入印尼铺平道路
    印度尼西亚苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权在内外交困的情况下，变本加厉地出卖民族利益和国家主权，让以美国为首的帝国主义国家的垄断资本源源涌入印尼，掠夺印尼的资源，榨取印尼人民的血汗。
    苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权在去年干了一系列出卖民族利益和国家主权的勾当后，今年以来，更放手地对印尼的石油、森林、矿产、工业、渔业、银行业和交通运输业实行大拍卖。据报道，这个法西斯军人政权的矿业部去年年底宣布，将把“印尼过去很少为人所知的广大地区”的矿藏，都让给外国的垄断资本家开发。今年三月，这个政权的基本工业、轻工业和动力部又决定，向外国垄断资本家开放石油、橡胶、肥料、化工机械、飞机装配、煤气设备等工业项目。同时，印尼法西斯军人政权还把全印尼可开发的森林的一半，让给六十家外国的资本家采伐。它还批准美、英、日、荷等国十二家银行在印尼开业，为外国资本控制印尼的金融创造了条件。这个法西斯军人政权不久前还把前印尼政府接管的比利时、瑞士在苏门答腊的种植园如数发还。这个政权登台后两年来，已退还美、英、西德、比利时、瑞士等国在印尼的二十家企业。
    目前，外国垄断资本家正在纷纷闯入印尼。据印尼法西斯军人政权的官员今年一月透露，一九六八年准备到印尼投资的外国垄断资本已有一百多起。
    美帝国主义是掠夺和剥削印尼人民的元凶。在今年侵入印尼的外国资本中，无论在投资额或工程项目方面，美国都占绝对多数。据报道，仅到三月下旬，由印尼卖国政权批准美国的投资就达一亿零一百七十万美元，占外国投资总额的百分之七十多。美国垄断资本霸占了西伊里安的铜矿，并在那里修建铜矿加工厂、专用公路、机场和港口。美国垄断资本还同苏门答腊反动地方政权勾结，开发和掠夺苏门答腊的石油。由美国资本家拥有多数股票的加拿大国际镍公司霸占了南苏拉威西的镍矿，这个公司在那里修建加工厂、水电厂和专用港口。美国垄断资本伙同日本、菲律宾、南朝鲜的资本家瓜分了加里曼丹一望无际的森林。印尼卖国政权今年二月批准开业的十二家外国银行中，属于美国垄断资本的就有五家。
    美帝国主义在亚洲的忠实走狗日本垄断资本集团，对印尼丰富的天然资源一直垂涎欲滴，野心勃勃。去年年底美日两国反动头目约翰逊和佐藤密谋合伙掠夺印尼以后，日本垄断资本更肆无忌惮地向印尼的石油、农业、森林和渔业等资源进行经济渗透。
    印尼法西斯军人集团是出卖印尼民族利益和国家主权的一伙卖国贼。他们奴颜婢膝地同美帝国主义签订了保证美国垄断资本投资安全的卖国协定，并通过一道又一道“法令”，为外国垄断资本涌入印尼敞开大门，把印尼的丰富资源拱手送给外国垄断资本。印尼法西斯政权还派遣出一个又一个官方代表团，到国外一面乞讨援助，一面揖请外国垄断资本侵入印尼。三月末，这个法西斯军人集团的头目苏哈托靠刺刀爬上总统的“宝座”后的第二天，就迫不及待地跑到日本，向日本反动政府乞求施舍和投资。他竟厚颜无耻地说，他的政权规定了对外国企业的各种免税办法，为外国垄断资本“在印尼的工业投资铺平了道路”。他奴性十足地向日本垄断资本家说，印尼“可以作为向日本供应原料的国家”，“可以成为日本产品的良好市场”。苏哈托的卑鄙行径，赤裸裸地暴露了他卖国贼的丑恶面目，也暴露了印尼法西斯军人政权内外交困的窘态。
