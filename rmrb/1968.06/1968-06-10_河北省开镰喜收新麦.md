The summer harvest crops in Hebei Province, totaling 30 million mu, have successively ripened, and the southern regions have begun harvesting the new wheat.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Shijiazhuang, June 8th, Hebei Province has organized the summer harvest work exceptionally well under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. A notable feature of this year's wheat harvest is that the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, under the leadership of the revolutionary committees at various levels, have displayed the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day" and have harvested the wheat quickly and well. The Handan region experienced several hot winds in June, causing the wheat to ripen quickly. The Handan regional and county revolutionary committees mobilized the masses to harvest in a timely manner. Nearly 2 million members, workers, students, and cadres from all over the region rushed to the fields to harvest the wheat. In just five days, over 3 million mu of dryland wheat were harvested on time.

Hebei Province experienced a severe drought last winter and a cold spring this year, causing significant frost and drought damage to the winter wheat. The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres throughout the province, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions to "make up your mind, do not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," have combined revolution with production, fully mobilized the people's initiative, fought against nature, strengthened management, and gradually improved the wheat's growth. The Shijiazhuang region has over 3 million mu of wheat fields. In the spring, one-tenth of the wheat fields suffered severe frost damage, and some community members and cadres became pessimistic. The Shijiazhuang regional and county revolutionary committees promptly organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes, addressing this issue by studying Chairman Mao's relevant instructions, launching a revolutionary criticism campaign, and breaking down the "fatalism" and pessimistic sentiments, while establishing the idea that humans can conquer nature. The entire region's cadres and community members have displayed the revolutionary spirit of continuous struggle, continuously irrigating and fertilizing, making the wheat's growth approach the record-breaking harvest of 1967.

In the northern regions of Hebei Province, where the summer harvest is later, the broad masses of community members and cadres have broken the conventional practices, adhering to the spirit of "not stopping management until the wheat is in hand," continuing to irrigate and fertilize, strengthening late-stage management, and striving to make the wheat grains plump and increase the yield.

    河北省开镰喜收新麦
    据新华社石家庄八日电　河北省三千万亩夏收作物陆续成熟，南部地区已开镰喜收新麦。
    河北省今年以毛泽东思想统帅“三夏”工作，夏收工作组织得格外好。今年麦收的显著特点是，广大贫下中农在各级革命委员会领导下，发扬“只争朝夕”的革命精神，麦子收得快，收得好。邯郸地区进入六月连刮几场热风，小麦成熟很快，邯郸地区和县革委会发动群众及时收割，全区近二百万社员、工人、学生和机关干部一齐下地抢收，仅五天时间，三百多万亩旱地小麦都适时收好。
    河北省去年冬旱，今年春寒，冬小麦受到严重的旱冻灾害。全省贫下中农和革命干部遵循伟大领袖毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，抓革命，促生产，充分发挥人的积极因素，战天斗地，加强管理，使小麦长势逐渐变好。石家庄地区三百多万亩麦田，开春时受冻，十分之一的麦田死苗严重，部分社员、干部产生了悲观情绪。石家庄地区和县革委会及时举办了毛泽东思想学习班，带着这个问题学习毛主席的有关教导，开展革命大批判，大破“定局论”和悲观情绪，大立人定胜天的思想。全区干部、社员发扬连续作战的革命精神，连续浇水追肥，使小麦长势接近获得特大丰收的一九六七年。
    河北省北部夏收较晚的地区，广大社员、干部打破常规，本着“小麦不到手，管理不罢休”的精神，仍在继续浇水施肥，加强后期管理，力促麦粒饱满，增加收成。
