Approximately 300,000 British railway workers, in a massive nationwide work-to-rule campaign, have dealt a severe blow to the Wilson government's policy of shifting economic burdens onto the working class. The workers are protesting against the British Railway Board's intensified exploitation and demanding a comprehensive wage increase.

On the night of June 23, 270,000 members of the National Union of Railwaymen began their work-to-rule campaign, refusing to work overtime, on Sundays, or on holidays, and deliberately slowing down their work. They are demanding a 6% to 9% wage increase for all railway workers. This demand was made as early as last August but was rejected by the British Railway Board. The Board even unreasonably proposed that wage increases could only be considered if workers agreed to increased workloads and reduced manpower (over 150,000 railway jobs have been cut in the past five years). The workers, of course, refused, and decided to launch the nationwide work-to-rule campaign.

On June 24, 35,000 members of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen also joined the struggle.

The work-to-rule campaign has thrown British railway transportation into chaos, severely impacting the already fragile British economy, particularly in the export trade, which British monopolies consider the lifeline of the British economy. On June 24, over 1,000 trains were canceled, and hundreds more were delayed. Some lines were even closed for the entire day. On the first morning of the work-to-rule campaign, British railway transportation was reduced by 40%, and in the London area, it was reduced by 60%.

The Wilson government was taken aback by the nationwide work-to-rule campaign and held an emergency meeting on the morning of June 24 to discuss measures to deal with the railway workers.

The British economy is rapidly deteriorating. Since the British government was forced to devalue the pound in November last year, it has not only failed to stop the continuing financial crisis but has instead seen the crisis deepen with the increasing foreign trade deficit.

In the first quarter of this year, Britain's balance of payments deficit reached 282 million pounds, more than double the 133 million pounds deficit for the whole of 1966, and more than half of the 540 million pounds deficit for the whole of 1967, which led to the devaluation of the pound.

The worsening of Britain's balance of payments is mainly due to the continuous expansion of the foreign trade deficit. Statistics show that Britain's foreign trade deficit has increased from an average of 8 million pounds per month in the first quarter of last year to an average of 65 million pounds per month in the first quarter of this year. In April and May of this year, the deficit further increased to 86 million pounds.

What troubles the British ruling class the most is that despite efforts to reduce imports, the value of imports is still much higher than before the devaluation of the pound; despite efforts to increase exports, the value of exports has been declining since January of this year. Moreover, among the large increase in imports, there are not only raw materials but also industrial semi-finished and finished products, including steel, machinery, and automobiles. This indicates that despite the devaluation of the pound and the relative increase in foreign prices, British industrial products are still not competitive, even in the domestic market.

The deep crisis in Britain's balance of payments has led to a rapid depletion of its gold and foreign exchange reserves. By May of this year, reserves had fallen to 1.144 billion pounds, 79 million pounds less than at the time of the pound's devaluation.

All of the above has made the pound, which is still in a very weak position after devaluation, frequently subject to heavy pressure in the international financial market.

However, the seriousness of the problem lies in the fact that, as the financial crisis continues to worsen, the short-term foreign debts accumulated by the Labour government during various pound crises are either due or soon to be due. For this reason, the British government recently had to draw 1.4 billion dollars from the "International Monetary Fund" for debt repayment. As a result, by the middle of 1971, Britain will have to repay 2.9 billion dollars to the "International Monetary Fund."

    英国三十万铁路员工怠工使一千多次列车停开
    英国入超巨大外汇短缺外债累累日子难过
    新华社伦敦二十四日电　英国大约三十万铁路员工为反对英国铁路局加紧对工人的剥削，争取全面增加工资而展开了声势浩大的全国性怠工。这使威尔逊政府执行的向工人转嫁财政经济困难的政策受到又一次严重的打击。
    参加英国全国铁路工人工会的二十七万铁路员工，从二十三日午夜起开始怠工，拒绝为铁路当局加班加点，拒绝在星期天和假日上工，并且放慢工作速度。他们要求为全体铁路员工全面增加工资百分之六至百分之九。这个要求早在去年八月就提出来了，但是遭到英国铁路局的拒绝。铁路局甚至无理提出，铁路员工只有在加强劳动强度和减少劳动力（在五年内，铁路员工已减少十五万人以上）的条件下，才能增加工资。铁路员工当然不答应，于是决定举行全国性怠工。
    参加机车司机司炉联合协会的三万五千铁路工人，二十四日也投入了斗争。
    铁路员工的怠工使英国的铁路交通运输陷于混乱，从而使百孔千疮的英国财政经济，特别是在英国垄断资本看作英国经济生命线的出口贸易方面，受到严重的影响。二十四日已经有一千多次列车停开，还有好几百次列车误点，某些线路甚至整天关闭。在铁路员工怠工的第一个早晨，英国铁路交通运输就减少了百分之四十，在伦敦区甚至减少百分之六十。
    威尔逊政府对铁路员工的全国性怠工惊慌失措，二十四日上午举行了紧急会议，策划对付铁路工人的措施。
    据新华社伦敦二十四日电　英国的财政经济情况正在急剧恶化。去年十一月间英国政府被迫实行英镑贬值后，不仅未能阻止财政金融危机的继续发展，相反，随着对外贸易赤字的不断增加，这种危机已经越来越严重。
    今年第一季度，英国国际收支逆差高达二亿八千二百万英镑，比一九六六年英国全年的国际收支逆差（一亿三千三百万英镑）翻了一番还要多，而且达到了导致英镑贬值的一九六七年全年国际收支逆差（五亿四千万英镑）的一半以上。
    英国国际收支情况恶化，主要由于对外贸易逆差不断扩大。据统计数字，英国的对外贸易逆差，已从去年第一季度的每月平均八百万英镑扩大到今年第一季度的每月平均六千五百万英镑。在今年四月份和五月份，逆差又进一步增加到八千六百万英镑。
    最使英国统治阶级苦恼的是：尽管当局竭力压缩进口，但进口值却大大高于英镑贬值前的水平；尽管当局拚命要扩大出口，但出口值从今年一月以来却不断下降。而且，在大量增加的进口物资中，不仅有原料，还有工业制成品和半制成品，其中包括钢铁、机械和汽车等。这表明：尽管英镑贬值后外国货价格相对上涨，英国的工业品却仍然竞争不过别人，即使在本国市场也如此。
    英国国际收支的深刻危机，导致英国的黄金和外汇储备日益枯竭。今年五月，储备已经下降到十一亿四千四百万英镑，比英镑被迫贬值时又少了七千九百万英镑。
    上述一切情况，使得贬值后地位仍然十分虚弱的英镑，在国际金融市场上经常受到沉重的压力。
    然而，问题的严重性还在于：在英国财政金融危机继续恶化的同时，工党政府上台以来在历次英镑危机中累积起来的对外短期债务，有的已经到期，有的马上就要到期。为此，英国政府最近不得不向
  “国际货币基金”组织提取了十四亿美元的备用信贷，以供还债之用。这样一来，英国到一九七一年年中要还给“国际货币基金”组织的贷款就增加到二十九亿美元。
