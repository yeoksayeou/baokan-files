Prime Minister, Ladies and Gentlemen,

The friendship between Tanzania and the People's Republic of China is a friendship between the most unequal of equals. Perhaps for this reason, some other countries in the world find it difficult to understand: they always hint that Tanzania is a satellite of China, or sometimes they say that our friendship is about to break. This is probably a fantasy, or else a misunderstanding of the nature of friendship, thinking that friendship is exclusive—that you cannot be friends with many countries if these countries themselves are not close friends.

I admit that in the present world, true friendship between very large countries and very small countries is relatively rare. Because in such a situation, friendship means that both sides acknowledge that differences in size, wealth, and power are irrelevant to the equality between sovereign states. It means that both sides acknowledge these differences but consider them relevant only when they are necessary or beneficial to the friendship itself.

Prime Minister, the friendship between China and Tanzania is based on the principles of respect and equality. Our friendship is not exclusive; we do not interfere in each other's internal affairs. When we feel we can cooperate, we do so; if one of us is unwilling, then we do something else. I can say with certainty that Tanzania has benefited from this friendship, and we cherish it. No foreign country can interfere with it; only we ourselves, through our actions towards the other party, can destroy it. Therefore, I have no reason to believe that the friendship between Tanzania and China will not last and grow stronger.

Prime Minister, apart from this, I would like to say that I and my colleagues are not here to ask China to provide a nuclear umbrella for Tanzania. Colonialism in Africa comes in various forms. Some of our countries are called colonies, some are called protectorates; some are called provinces, and others are called trust territories. In fact, they are all colonies, and they all correctly reject their colonial status. Therefore, if I were to ask China to declare Tanzania as its nuclear protectorate, then the Tanzanian people would have every right to condemn me as a stooge of new nuclear colonialism.

What we seek in our relations with all countries in the world is an equal relationship. It is mainly for this reason that Tanzania opposes the Non-Proliferation Treaty. We consider this to be a highly unequal treaty. This treaty requires non-nuclear countries, including those with nuclear potential, to give up the right to manufacture and possess nuclear weapons, but it does not require nuclear powers to stop producing any nuclear weapons; it does not require nuclear powers to destroy their existing nuclear weapons. Worst of all, it does not require nuclear powers to guarantee that they will not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against countries that agree to sign the treaty. Instead, the nuclear powers merely declare that they will protect non-nuclear signatory countries from nuclear attacks. According to this treaty, if a country can swear on the Bible or the Quran that it is developing nuclear explosives solely for peaceful purposes, it is still not allowed to do so. It must go to the nuclear powers to purchase such explosives. For the first time in history, a major and far-reaching human invention is monopolized by a few.

We oppose this treaty, not because we want to retain the right to manufacture or accept nuclear weapons. We do not have the ability to do so, nor do we want to. We oppose it because it is an unequal treaty that cannot even contribute to the cause of peace. The monopoly of weapons cannot lead to true peace; it can only lead to so-called peace, just like the Roman-style peace and the British-style peace.

Prime Minister, your country is a nuclear power, and mine is not. On this specific issue, we happen to hold similar views. Of course, this does not mean that China and Tanzania will always adopt the same policies and always take the same actions. China is a major Asian country; we are part of Africa. Both of us are concerned with international peace and human justice, but our current primary tasks are different, and the nature of our difficulties is different.

For example, in Asia, traditional colonialism has been virtually defeated. Political independence has been won everywhere. What remains to be done is the struggle to make this independence meaningful, that is, to make it the independence of the people, not just a change of flags, presidents, and ceremonies, while the masses continue to suffer exploitation by new and old masters.

In Africa, we indeed have to wage this struggle against neocolonialism. But at the same time, we also have to wage a struggle against foreign occupation and against the oppression of a racist minority. We also face the fact that our southern neighbor, Mozambique, is ruled by Portugal, with sixty thousand Portuguese troops defying the will of the Mozambican people and trying to maintain European rule there.

This is not an isolated case. The territories of Angola, Portuguese Guinea, and Southwest Africa are still occupied and enslaved by colonialists, who are determined to continue directly exploiting the African people. In addition, in South Africa and Rhodesia, racist minority governments have consistently ignored the dignity of non-whites and have tried to maintain their rule and economic privileges in this way.

Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, my country has gained freedom. It is precisely because we have gained freedom that I can represent my countrymen to come here to strengthen the friendship that exists between our two peoples. But at the same time, my country feels that it has not gained freedom because Africa has not yet gained freedom. My countrymen understand that our brothers are humiliated in Africa because they are black, and therefore we are also humiliated. My country and other independent countries in Africa are determined to change this situation. Africa will gain freedom. Africans in Africa will be respected. Because Africa will liberate itself. The struggle we face may be long; the machinations of neocolonialism may cause us to stumble in the process of seeking liberation. But the Organization of African Unity is capable of achieving its two goals. It will lead Africa to freedom and human dignity, and it will also lead Africa to unity.

Because the unity of a free Africa is our ultimate goal. I look forward to the day when I cannot come to China as the President of the United Republic of Tanzania, because to the outside world, Tanzania will no longer exist, and there will only be Africa. I yearn for the day when the President of the United States of Africa comes to China and other countries on state visits. (Let me quickly add that this does not mean I will no longer want to come to China in the future! This only means that I hope to come here as a citizen of Africa to renew old friendships!)

Our ambition is great, and we do not expect it to be realized quickly. But we will not abandon it just because we cannot clearly see this goal, just as you did not abandon it when you could not see today's China from the caves of Yan'an. The most important thing is that we are determined to eradicate imperialism from Africa, and we will not compromise on this. At present, the people of Africa have already taken up arms in Mozambique, Angola, Portuguese Guinea, and Rhodesia. The warriors in these places will eventually win; this means that Africa will win, and therefore, Tanzania will win. We will succeed because we are fighting for our own freedom, our own homeland, and the future of our children. We will not hand over our inherent rights to anyone. Africa will be governed by Africans, and one day, Africans will be equal citizens in their homeland, regardless of skin color, race, and language.

I believe that the Chinese people understand this determination—Tanzania's determination, which is also Africa's determination. I believe you sympathize with our struggle, just as we sympathize with the Chinese people's determination to defend their country and build it according to their own wishes. Apart from this, we have no other requests. Because we understand that no one else can make a nation free; freedom must be won and maintained by the people who desire it.

Finally, Prime Minister, I want to reiterate that I came to China to learn. I especially wanted to see some of the situation in your country after the Cultural Revolution. Over these three days, I have once again confirmed my belief that we can learn a lot from China. First, we should oppose the idea that isolating China can be beneficial to peace. This is very foolish. You cannot isolate seven hundred million people unless they are asleep. Secondly, there is a danger in Africa that some of us think that independence is enough. If we really want to transition from national independence to the true independence of the people, and if we really want to ensure that the African revolution continues to advance and does not degenerate into neocolonialism, then I say we should learn from you. Indeed, based on what I saw of China in 1965, I should say that if you felt it necessary to launch a Cultural Revolution to ensure that the new generation continues to advance under the banner of your revolution, then we certainly need such a revolution. In Tanzania, we see how easy it is to talk about socialism and the importance of the people, but in reality, our actions are like those of capitalists and small dictators.

During my first visit, when I saw your people's revolutionary spirit with my own eyes, I said in Shanghai that I hoped all the people of Tanzania could come to China to see with their own eyes what a determined people can achieve. Today, after the Cultural Revolution, the Chinese people are even more spirited. In Christianity, there is a saying: faith can move mountains. You Chinese people have a great faith, but it is not blind faith. You believe in the creative power of the people, you believe in your great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, you believe in the spirit of self-reliance and self-criticism, you believe that all oppressed peoples in the world are one family. But you do more than just believe; you put your faith into practice.

I am convinced that with this great spiritual power—this power has always been great in China, but through the Cultural Revolution, it has been renewed and strengthened—under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, you will certainly go from victory to victory. I wish you all the best.

Prime Minister, I and my colleagues are very happy to be able to visit the People's Republic of China again. You have received us with great warmth and hospitality. Our stay has been pleasant and beneficial.

Now, please join me in raising a toast to the friendship between the People's Republic of China and the United Republic of Tanzania,
To the prosperity of the People's Republic of China,
To the fighting friendship between the peoples of Tanzania and China,
To the health of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong,
To the health of Premier Zhou Enlai,
To the health of the respected ambassadors, guests, and all friends present,
Cheers!

### 在告别宴会上  尼雷尔总统的讲话

    在告别宴会上  尼雷尔总统的讲话
    新华社二十一日讯　尼雷尔总统在告别宴会上的讲话，全文如下：总理先生、诸位阁下、女士们、先生们：
    坦桑尼亚和中华人民共和国的友谊是最不相等的平等者之间的友谊。也许正因为如此，世界上的某些别的国家觉得难以理解：他们总是想暗示，坦桑尼亚是中国的卫星国，或者有时又说我们的友谊即将破裂。这大概是一种幻想，要不然就是对友谊的性质的一种误解，认为友谊是排他性的——即你不可能同许多国家都交朋友，如果这些国家本身不是亲密的朋友的话。
    我承认，在当前的世界上，很大的国家同很小的国家之间的真正友谊，是比较罕见的。因为在这种情况下的友谊意味着双方都承认，大小、财富和力量的差别同主权国家之间的平等是不相干的。它意味着双方都承认差别，但把这些差别看作是这样的一些事实，这些事实只在友谊本身需要或对友谊有利时，才有关系。
    总理先生，中国和坦桑尼亚之间的友谊是建立在这种尊重和平等的原则之上的。我们的友谊不是排他性的，我们互不干涉内政。当我们感到可以合作的时候，我们就合作；如果我们中间有一方觉得不愿意，那末我们就转而搞些别的事情。我可以十分断然地说，坦桑尼亚从这一友谊中受益，我们珍视这种友谊。任何外国都不能干预它；只有我们自己，通过我们自己对另一方采取的行动，才能毁灭它。因此，我没有理由相信，坦桑尼亚和中国之间的友谊不会永存和与日俱增。
    总理先生，除此之外，我还愿意说，我和我的同事们并不是到中国来要求中国为坦桑尼亚提供核保护伞的。殖民主义在非洲是打着各种招牌的。我们有些国家被称为殖民地，有些叫保护国；有些叫省，还有一些叫托管地。其实，它们都是殖民地，它们也都正确地拒绝接受他们的殖民地地位。因此，如果我是来要求中国宣布坦桑尼亚为它的核保护国，那么坦桑尼亚人民就完全有权谴责我是新型的核殖民主义的走狗。
    我们所谋求的我们同世界各国的关系是一种平等的关系。正是主要为了这一原因，坦桑尼亚才反对防止核扩散条约。我们认为，这是一个极不平等的条约。这个条约要求包括有核潜力的国家在内的无核国家放弃制造和拥有核武器的权利，但它并不要求核大国自己停止再制造任何核武器；它不要求核大国销毁他们已有的核武器。而最糟的是，它不要求核大国保证不对同意签署该条约的国家使用或威胁使用核武器。相反地，核大国仅仅自己宣布，它们将保护无核的签字国，使之免受核攻击。根据这一条约，如果一个国家能够手按圣经或可兰经宣誓，它发展核爆炸物完全是为了和平目的，也不允许它这样做。它必须向核大国去购买这种爆炸物。人类的重大和具有深远意义的发明，在历史上第一次被少数人所垄断。
    我们反对这个条约，不是因为要保留我们制造或接受核武器的权利。我们没有能力这样做，也不想这样做。我们反对它，因为它是一个不平等条约，甚至不能对和平事业做出贡献。对武器的垄断不能导致真正的和平；它只能导致所谓的和平，正象罗马式的和平和不列颠式的和平一样。
    总理先生，你的国家是一个核大国，我的国家并不是。在这个特定的问题上，我们目前恰巧持有类似的观点。当然，这并不意味着中国和坦桑尼亚总是会采取相同的政策，两国总是会采取相同的做法。中国是一个亚洲大国；我们是非洲的一部分。我们双方都关心国际和平和人类正义，但是我们双方当前的首要任务是不同的，我们的困难性质是不同的。
    例如，在亚洲，那种传统的殖民主义实际上现在已经被击败了。到处都赢得了政治独立。还要继续进行的是使这种独立真正有意义的斗争，即要使它成为人民的独立，而不是仅仅改换国旗、总统和礼仪，而群众却继续遭受新老主子的剥削。
    在非洲，我们的确要进行这种反对新殖民主义的斗争。但是，我们同时还要进行反对外国占领和反对种族主义的少数人压迫的斗争。我们还面临着这样的事实，即坦桑尼亚南部的邻国为葡萄牙所统治，有六万名葡萄牙军队违背莫三鼻给人民的意愿，企图维持那里的欧洲人统治。
    这并不是个别的情况。安哥拉、葡属几内亚、西南非等国土仍然被殖民主义者所占领，所奴役，殖民主义者决心要继续直接剥削非洲人民。此外，在南非和罗得西亚，种族主义的少数人政府一贯无视非白种人的人格，企图以此来维持他们的政权和经济特权。
    总理先生，女士们，先生们，我国已获得了自由。正因为获得了自由，我才能够代表我国同胞到这里来加强存在于我们两国人民之间的友谊。但是，我的国家同时又感到它没有获得自由，因为非洲还没有获得自由。我国同胞懂得，我们的弟兄因为是黑人而在非洲受人凌辱，因此他们也在遭受凌辱。我国和非洲其它的独立国家一起，决心改变这种状况。非洲将获得自由。非洲人在非洲将受到尊重。因为非洲将解放自己。我们面临的斗争可能是长期的；新殖民主义的阴谋诡计可能使我们在争取解放的进程中有时会步子踉跄。但是，非洲统一组织是能实现它的两个目标的。它将把非洲引向自由和人类尊严，它也将把非洲引向统一。
    因为自由非洲的统一是我们的最终目标。我盼望着这样一天的到来，那时我不能以坦桑尼亚联合共和国总统的身份前来中国，因为对外界来讲，坦桑尼亚已不存在，而只有非洲了。我向往的是，非洲合众国的总统到中国和其他国家进行国事访问。（让我赶紧补充一句，这并不意味着我今后再也不愿意到中国来！这只是说，我希望能够作为一个非洲的公民来这里重叙旧谊！）
    我们的这个志向是很宏伟的，我们并不指望它很快实现。但我们不会因为不能清楚地看到这个目标而放弃它，正象你们并没有因为从延安窑洞里看不到今日的中国而放弃一样。最主要的是，我们决心从非洲铲除帝国主义，对此我们决不妥协。目前，非洲人民已经在莫三鼻给、安哥拉、葡属几内亚和罗得西亚拿起了武器。这些地方的战士们迟早要赢得胜利；这就意味着非洲将赢得胜利，因此，坦桑尼亚将赢得胜利。我们会成功，因为我们正在为自己的自由、自己的家园和我们孩子们的未来而战斗。我们不会把我们生而有之的权利拱手让给任何人。非洲将由非洲人治理，总有一天，非洲人将不分肤色、种族和语言在他们的故乡成为平等的公民。
    我相信中国人民理解我们的这种决心——坦桑尼亚的决心，也是非洲的决心。我相信你们同情我们的斗争，正如我们同情中国人民决心保卫自己的国家和按照自己的愿望建设自己的国家一样。除此之外，我们别无要求。因为我们懂得，任何其他人都不能使一个民族获得自由，自由必须由期望享有自由的人民去赢得和维护。
    最后，总理先生，我要重申我是到中国来学习的。我特别想来看看贵国在文化革命后的一些情况。这三天来，使我再次证实了我的信念，那就是我们能从中国学到很多东西。首先，我们应该反对这种主张，即孤立中国就可以有利于和平。这是非常愚蠢的。你不可能孤立七亿人，除非他们睡觉了。其次，在非洲有这样一种危险，即我们中有些人认为独立已经足够了。如果我们真的想从民族独立过渡到人民的真正独立，并且我们真的要确保非洲革命一直向前发展，而不致蜕化成为新殖民主义，那末我说，我们就应该向你们学习。确实，根据我在一九六五年所看到的中国的情况，我应该说，如果你们为了确保使新的一代继续举着你们革命的旗帜前进而感到有必要开展一次文化革命的话，那末我们当然也需要这样一次革命。在坦桑尼亚，我们看到口头上空谈社会主义和人民的重要性是多么容易，而实际上我们的行为却象资本家和小独裁者。
    在我第一次来访时，当我亲眼看到了你们人民的革命精神，我曾在上海说过，我希望全体坦桑尼亚人民都能到中国来，亲眼看看一个有决心的人民所能做到的事情。今天，经过了文化革命，中国人民更加意气风发。在基督教中有一个谚语：信仰可以移山。你们中国人民有着伟大的信仰，但不是盲目的信仰。你们相信人民的创造力，你们信仰你们伟大的领袖毛泽东主席，你们相信自力更生和自我批评的精神，你们相信全世界被压迫人民是一家人。但你们不只是信仰，你们做得更多。你们向我们说明了只是信仰是不够的，应该把信仰付诸实践。
    我确信，你们有了这种巨大的精神力量，——这种力量在中国一向是十分巨大的，但通过文化革命，现在又重新焕发和加强了——在伟大领袖毛泽东主席的指导下，你们一定会从胜利走向胜利。我向你们致以良好的祝愿。
    总理先生，我和我的同事们能再次访问中华人民共和国，感到十分高兴。你们十分热情和殷勤地接待了我们。我们的逗留是愉快的，有益的。
    现在，请大家跟我一起举杯，为中华人民共和国和坦桑尼亚联合共和国的友谊，
    为中华人民共和国的繁荣昌盛，
    为坦桑尼亚和中国两国人民之间的战斗友谊，
    为中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席的健康，
    为周恩来总理的健康，
    为在座的尊敬的大使们、客人们和所有朋友们的健康，
    干杯！
