The great proletarian cultural revolution guided by Mao Zedong Thought is powerfully promoting the prosperous development of industrial production in Shanghai, this major industrial base. The Shanghai proletariat, with class struggle as the key link, has been carrying out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, launching fierce attacks on class enemies, and achieving splendid victories in the struggle to seize revolution and promote production. Since the beginning of this year, the total industrial output value has been rising steadily, with each month surpassing the previous one.

The New China News Agency, Shanghai, June 22: Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the Shanghai proletariat, with class struggle as the key link, has been carrying out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, launching fierce attacks on class enemies, and achieving one splendid victory after another in the great struggle to seize revolution and promote production.

Practice has shown that the unprecedented great proletarian cultural revolution is powerfully promoting the great development of productive forces in Shanghai, this major industrial base.

Since the beginning of this year, Shanghai's total industrial output value has been rising steadily, with each month surpassing the previous one. Inspiring reports of victories have been coming in frequently. In March, the proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary workers on Shanghai's industrial and transportation fronts, on the basis of achieving dual victories in revolution and production in the first two months, fought a very brilliant battle in the production field, with production increasing significantly. In April, they continued their efforts, and the total industrial output value again far exceeded that of March. In May, the total industrial output value increased by 11.6 percent over April, surpassing the levels of the same periods in the previous two years, raising Shanghai's industrial production level to a new height. In industries such as metallurgy, machinery, chemicals, textiles, and light industry, many factories have created the highest production levels since their establishment. The production of some important products needed for national construction and people's livelihood, such as steel, machine tools, electric motors, dyed fabrics, pesticides, plastics, watches, antibiotics, bicycles, carbide, paper, and light bulbs, all increased significantly in May compared to April. Entering June, the industrial and transportation fronts in Shanghai launched an even more magnificent struggle to seize revolution and promote production, with the revolutionary and production situation becoming even better.

The proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary workers on Shanghai's industrial and transportation fronts, armed with great Mao Zedong Thought, have shown heroic spirit in the production struggle this year, striving against time and overcoming all difficulties. The oxygen steelmaking in the third converter workshop of Shanghai First Steel Plant used to maintain an average output of about 15 furnaces per shift; before the May 1 International Labor Day this year, it suddenly increased to 18 furnaces, and on May 1, it leaped to 20 furnaces, reaching an unprecedented high level. The production level of the No. 17 Cotton Mill last year exceeded that of the previous year, creating a historical record; since this year, production has been rising month by month, each month surpassing the level of the same period last year. Revolutionary workers have been carrying out technical innovations and technological revolutions, with new products, new technologies, and new inventions emerging continuously. The Shanghai Machine Tool Plant, which specializes in producing precision grinders, has successfully developed nearly as many high-level new types of precision grinders this year as the total for the whole of 1966. The Shanghai Diesel Engine Plant, which had been working for a long time without success on a type of high-pressure oil pump with international advanced level before the great proletarian cultural revolution, successfully developed it in just a few months this year.

The proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary workers on Shanghai's industrial and transportation fronts have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call to "further economize and make revolution." Many factories have tapped potential, carried out technical innovations, and completed and overfulfilled production tasks with less or even without coal allocated by the state. The achievements in coal saving on Shanghai's industrial front this year are unprecedented.

The people's revolution guided by great Mao Zedong Thought is the locomotive of historical progress. The emergence of a great situation on Shanghai's industrial and transportation fronts is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary workers on Shanghai's industrial and transportation fronts, who have deep proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, have been even more eager to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the great proletarian cultural revolution. As soon as Chairman Mao's latest instructions are issued, they act immediately and carry them out seriously. Mao Zedong Thought study classes are now not only set up in factories, workshops, and teams but also in many workers' families. The part-time "Anti-Japanese Military and Political University" style Mao Zedong Thought study classes set up by the Shanghai Diesel Engine Plant have spread throughout the city. Mao Zedong Thought is more widely popularized than ever before.

Armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the Shanghai proletariat has made many things possible that were previously considered impossible; many production quotas that had been stagnant for a long time have been quickly broken through. The falling and bending group of the Shanghai Alloy Bearing Factory used to produce bearing blanks at a rate of about 3,000 pieces per shift, and some people thought that due to equipment limitations, it was impossible to increase the output. The workers in this group said proudly, "Machines are dead, but people are alive. People armed with Mao Zedong Thought can transform machines." They fought tenaciously, carried out technical innovations, and created a miracle of 9,000 pieces per shift in May.

The workers at the Shanghai Port docks accepted a heavy task of unloading a ship carrying 34,000 tons of cargo in May. This ship was rare in Shanghai Port operations and was the first time it came to Shanghai, and the ship type was unfamiliar. The workers studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, worked hard and smartly, and unloaded all 34,000 tons of cargo from the ship in just over three days, creating the highest unloading speed record in Shanghai Port.

In the struggle to seize revolution and promote production, the proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary workers on Shanghai's industrial and transportation fronts have held high the banner of revolutionary criticism guided by Mao Zedong Thought, continuously pushing the revolutionary criticism mass movement forward. Now, the revolutionary criticism movement in all factories and enterprises in the city has generally developed to be carried out in-depth in teams as the battlefield. Many workshops and teams have set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, which are not only classrooms for studying Mao Zedong Thought but also battlefields for criticizing Liu Shaoqi (referred to as the Chinese Khrushchev). In recent periods, the proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary workers have further combined revolutionary criticism with in-depth struggle against enemies. They have exposed and criticized a group of stubborn class enemies, including a handful of capitalist roaders, traitors, spies, and other counter-revolutionaries, smashing the enemies' plot to sabotage production and revolution. The Hua Feng Steel Plant has, in recent months, mobilized the masses to launch continuous attacks on class enemies, striking back at the enemies' attempts to reverse verdicts, exposing the black hands that sabotaged production and incited workers to fight each other, and digging out the remnants of the reactionary Kuomintang protected by capitalist roaders. The revolutionary and production situation has been completely changed. The Shanghai Glass Machinery Factory mobilized the masses to expose and criticize a handful of class enemies, greatly promoting the development of revolution and production. Through in-depth criticism of Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Shanghai and their units who advocated the theory of "extinction of class struggle" and the reactionary revisionist goods of "production first," "technology first," "profit-oriented," and "material incentives," the broad revolutionary workers have greatly raised their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. Many shackles of revisionism have been smashed, greatly liberating the productive forces.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, in the process of seizing revolution and promoting production, a mass movement of learning from each other, helping each other, and catching up with each other with Mao Zedong Thought as the banner has emerged on Shanghai's industrial and transportation fronts. The proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary workers use great Mao Zedong Thought to inspire and support each other, learn from each other, help each other, and make joint progress. Many factories have organized Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams between workshops, between factories, and between industries to propagate Mao Zedong Thought to each other and promote each other in seizing revolution and promoting production. In a previous period, the production of dyeing, knitting, and weaving factories in the textile industry developed relatively quickly, while some cotton spinning mills could not keep up. At this time, some knitting and weaving factories sent Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to cotton spinning mills to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, propagate the great situation of the great proletarian cultural revolution, and propagate the great significance of cotton spinning mills supporting themselves. In this way, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary workers in cotton spinning mills was further inspired, and they redoubled their efforts to promote production. The Wusong Chemical Plant actively invited users to send people to their plant to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, inspiring and supporting each other, promoting the thought revolutionization of people and the growth of production. This mass movement of learning from each other, helping each other, and catching up with each other with great Mao Zedong Thought as the banner, and this proletarian revolutionary spirit of consciously educating oneself with Mao Zedong Thought, fully reflects the broad revolutionary workers in Shanghai's love and loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought.

Many revolutionary committees in Shanghai's factories and enterprises have followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "being both an official and a common person" in seizing revolution and promoting production, going deep into the grassroots, studying, working, and fighting with the masses. Some factory revolutionary committees, except for a few people on duty, have all gone to teams to "settle down." After the cadres went down, they took turns working, held Mao Zedong Thought study classes with the masses, implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, carried out revolutionary criticism, launched attacks on class enemies, studied and worked according to the arrangements of the teams, and became students of the masses, blending in with the masses. In this way, the relationship between cadres and the masses has been greatly strengthened, the newly born revolutionary committees have been further consolidated, and the revolutionary committees have gradually been built into revolutionary command departments that are connected with the masses.

    毛泽东思想指引下的无产阶级文化大革命  强有力地推动着上海的工业生产蓬勃发展
    上海工人阶级以阶级斗争为纲，深入持久地开展革命大批判，主动地向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，在抓革命促生产中取得辉煌胜利。今年以来，工业生产总值直线上升，一月胜过一月
    新华社上海二十二日电 在毛主席的一系列最新指示指引下，上海工人阶级以阶级斗争为纲，深入持久地开展革命大批判，主动地向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，在抓革命、促生产的伟大斗争中取得了一个又一个辉煌的胜利。
    斗争实践雄辩地说明：史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，正在强有力地推动着上海这个大工业基地生产力的大发展。
    今年以来，上海工业生产总值直线上升，一月胜过一月。鼓舞人心的捷报频频传来。三月份，上海工业交通战线的无产阶级革命派和革命职工，在头两个月取得革命、生产双胜利的基础上，在生产领域里打了一个十分漂亮的胜仗，生产大幅度增长。四月份再接再厉，工业生产总值又大大超过了三月份。五月份的工业生产总值，又比四月份超过了百分之十一点六，超过了去年和前年同期的水平，把上海工业生产水平提到了一个新的高度。冶金、机械、化工、纺织、轻工业等各个行业，都有一批工厂的生产创造了建厂以来的最高水平。国家建设和人民生活需要的一些重要产品，如钢材、机床、电动机、印染布、农药、塑料、手表、抗菌素、自行车、电石、纸张、灯泡等，五月份的产量都比四月份大幅度增长。进入六月，上海工业交通战线展开了气势更加磅礴的抓革命、促生产的战斗，革命、生产形势更加大好。
    用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的上海工业交通战线的无产阶级革命派和革命职工，在今年以来的生产斗争中，表现出了与时间争速度，把一切困难踩在脚下的英雄气概。上海第一钢铁厂第三转炉车间的氧气炼钢，原来平均班产量一直保持在十五炉左右；今年“五一”国际劳动节前夕，一下子增加到十八炉，“五一”节当天，又跃到二十炉，达到前所未有的高水平。国棉十七厂去年的生产水平超过了前年，创造了历史最高纪录；今年以来的生产又月月上升，每月都超过去年同期的水平。广大革命职工大搞技术革新、技术革命，新产品、新工艺、新创造不断涌现。专门生产精密磨床的上海机床厂，今年以来试制成功的高水平的新型精密磨床的品种，接近一九六六年全年的总和。上海柴油机厂在无产阶级文化大革命以前搞了很长时间没有搞成的一种具有国际先进水平的高压油泵，今年仅仅花了几个月时间就试制成功了。
    上海工业交通战线无产阶级革命派和革命职工热烈响应毛主席提出的“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大号召。许多工厂挖潜力，搞技术革新，少要甚至不要国家分配的煤炭，完成和超额完成了生产任务。今年以来，上海工业战线节约煤炭所取得的成就，是前所未有的。
    毛泽东思想指引下的人民革命是历史前进的火车头。上海工业交通战线大好形势的出现，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。对伟大领袖毛主席怀着深厚无产阶级感情的上海工业交通战线的无产阶级革命派和革命职工，在无产阶级文化大革命中更加如饥似渴地活学活用毛主席著作。毛主席的最新指示一下达，他们就闻风而动，认真贯彻执行。毛泽东思想学习班现在不仅工厂办、车间办、班组办，而且很多工人家庭也办起来了。上海柴油机厂创办的业余“抗大”式毛泽东思想学习班，已经遍及全市。毛泽东思想空前大普及。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的上海工人阶级，使许多原来被认为办不到的事，现在办到了；一些原来长时期没有突破的生产定额，现在迅速突破了。上海合金轴瓦厂落料压弯组原来生产轴瓦毛坯每班产量一直停留在三千片左右，而且有人认为由于设备能力限制，再增加是不可能的。这个小组的工人豪迈地说，机器是死的，人是活的，用毛泽东思想武装的人可以改造机器。他们顽强奋战，大搞技术革新，五月份创造了班产九千片的奇迹。　
    上海港码头工人，五月份接受了替一条外轮卸货的艰巨任务。这条船载货三万四千吨，在上海港作业中还是少见的，又是第一次来上海，船型不熟悉。工人们活学活用毛主席著作，苦干加巧干，轮船上三万四千吨货物，以短短三天多的时间全部卸完，创造了上海港卸货速度的最高纪录。
    上海工业交通战线的无产阶级革命派和革命职工，在抓革命、促生产的战斗中，高举毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，把革命大批判的群众运动不断推向前进。现在，全市工厂企业的革命大批判运动已经普遍发展到以班组为阵地深入展开。许许多多车间和班组举办的毛泽东思想学习班，既是学习毛泽东思想的课堂，又是批判中国赫鲁晓夫的战场。最近一个时期，无产阶级革命派和革命职工，进一步把革命大批判和深入开展对敌斗争紧密结合了起来。他们把顽固不化的走资派、叛徒、特务和其他反革命分子，一个个揪了出来，狠狠打击了一小撮阶级敌人，粉碎了阶级敌人妄图以破坏生产来破坏革命的阴谋。华丰钢铁厂近几个月来经过深入发动群众，不停顿地向阶级敌人打进攻战，迎头痛击阶级敌人的翻案妖风，揪出了破坏生产、挑动群众斗群众的黑手，挖出了被走资派包庇下来的隐藏得很深的国民党反动派的残渣余孽，革命和生产面貌焕然一新。上海玻璃机械厂发动群众揪出了一小撮阶级敌人，对他们进行彻底的揭发批判，大大推动了革命和生产的发展。广大革命职工通过深入批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其在上海和本单位代理人所鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭”论和“生产第一”、“技术第一”、“利润挂帅”、“物质刺激”等反革命修正主义黑货，大大提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。许多束缚工人积极性的修正主义的条条框框被砸碎，大大解放了生产力。
    在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，上海工业交通战线在抓革命、促生产的过程中，出现了一个毛泽东思想挂帅的比学赶帮的群众运动。无产阶级革命派和革命职工用伟大的毛泽东思想互相激励，互相支援，比学赶帮，共同跃进。许多工厂的车间之间，厂与厂、行业与行业之间，组织了毛泽东思想宣传小分队，互相宣传毛泽东思想，在抓革命、促生产方面互相促进。前一时期，纺织工业的印染厂、针织厂、织布厂生产发展较快，有些棉纺厂一时跟不上。这时，有些针织厂和布厂的毛泽东思想宣传小分队，就来到棉纺厂宣传毛泽东思想，宣传无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，宣传棉纺厂对自己支援的重大意义。这样，就进一步激励了棉纺厂广大革命职工的革命热情，加倍努力地把生产促了上去。吴淞化工厂主动请用户厂派人到自己厂里来宣传毛泽东思想，相互激励，相互支持，促进了人的思想革命化和生产的增长。这种以伟大的毛泽东思想挂帅的比学赶帮运动，这种群众自觉地用毛泽东思想教育自己的无产阶级革命精神，充分体现了上海广大革命职工对毛泽东思想的热爱和忠诚。
    上海许多工厂企业革命委员会的新老革命干部，遵循毛主席关于“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的教导，在抓革命、促生产中深入基层，和群众同学习，同劳动，同战斗。有的工厂革委会除留少数人值班以外，都到班组“落户”。干部下去以后，顶班劳动，和群众一起办毛泽东思想学习班，一起落实毛主席的最新指示，一起搞革命大批判，一起向阶级敌人进攻，学习和劳动都听从班组安排，做群众的小学生，和群众打成一片。这样就大大密切了干群关系，进一步巩固了新生的革命委员会，逐渐把革委会建设成为革命化的联系群众的战斗指挥部。
