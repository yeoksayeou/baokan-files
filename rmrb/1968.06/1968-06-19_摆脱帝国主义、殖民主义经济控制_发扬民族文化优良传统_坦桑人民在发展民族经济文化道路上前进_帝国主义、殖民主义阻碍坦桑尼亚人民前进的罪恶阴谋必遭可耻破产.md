Tanzanian people are advancing on the path of self-reliance and developing national economy and culture.

To shake off the economic control of imperialism and colonialism and develop Tanzania's national economy, President Nyerere issued the "Arusha Declaration" on February 5 last year, announcing that the policy of self-reliance is the guiding principle for national development. Immediately after that, all foreign banks (including three British banks and two American banks), eight large flour mills, and eight major import-export companies were nationalized. At the same time, the government took control of a significant portion of the shares in another seven large companies.

Tanzania's sisal production ranks first in the world. For many years, sisal has been its main export crop. However, under long-term colonial rule, the sisal industry was entirely controlled by foreigners, and Tanzanian workers suffered endless abuse and exploitation. Shortly after the "Arusha Declaration" was issued, the Tanzanian government nationalized six of the larger sisal companies and took control of a significant portion of the shares in another thirty-three sisal companies, thereby bringing more than 60% of Tanzania's sisal industry under government control.

In August last year, Zanzibar also announced the nationalization of its foreign trade, with the government taking direct control of the important import-export business that had long been manipulated by private merchants.

At the same time, inspired by the "Arusha Declaration," the Tanzanian people have established some new industries.

Tanzania is basically an agricultural country, with 95% of its people living in rural areas and relying on agriculture for their livelihood. Therefore, the "Arusha Declaration" particularly emphasizes the development of agricultural production. In October, the Tanganyika African National Union held a national conference in Mwanza, where the issue of agricultural development was discussed. President Nyerere, in his speech at the conference, called on Tanzanian farmers to use ox-drawn plows and other improved farming tools to replace primitive tools, increase agricultural output, and improve living standards. To meet the needs of Tanzania's agricultural transformation, the construction of a farm implements factory, aided by China, is currently underway. Once completed, this factory will be able to produce a large number of ox-drawn plows and other farming tools annually.

To develop the national economy through self-reliance, the Tanzanian government signed an economic and technical cooperation agreement with the Chinese government in June 1964, based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and sincere cooperation. Currently, industrial and agricultural projects such as the Rufiji State Farm and the Friendship Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory, aided by China, are being built with the joint efforts of Tanzanian workers and Chinese technicians. Some of these projects have already been completed and put into production, while others will soon be completed. The completion of these projects will help the Tanzanian people achieve self-sufficiency in food and cloth. In September last year, the Tanzanian government and the Zambian government signed an agreement with the Chinese government in Beijing to aid in the construction of the Tanzania-Zambia Railway. Recently, the first group of Chinese technical personnel for the Tanzania-Zambia Railway survey and design team has arrived in Tanzania and begun work.

In the development of national culture, the Tanzanian government has also taken some measures. It abolished all racial discrimination in education during the colonial period, leading to a significant increase in the number of primary and secondary school students. Starting this year, Swahili, the national language of Tanzania, has been made the primary language of instruction and is being promoted in almost all primary schools nationwide. At the same time, the Tanzanian government is also paying attention to carrying forward the fine traditions of national culture and eliminating the corrupting influences of imperialism and colonialism.

The Tanzanian people's efforts to consolidate political independence and develop national economy and culture will continue to achieve victories. Any evil plots by imperialists and colonialists to hinder the progress of the Tanzanian people will inevitably meet with shameful failure.

    摆脱帝国主义、殖民主义经济控制　发扬民族文化优良传统
    坦桑人民在发展民族经济文化道路上前进
    帝国主义、殖民主义阻碍坦桑尼亚人民前进的罪恶阴谋必遭可耻破产
    据新华社达累斯萨拉姆十八日电　本社记者报道：坦桑尼亚人民正在自力更生、发展民族经济和文化的道路上前进。
    为了摆脱帝国主义、殖民主义的经济控制，发展坦桑尼亚的民族经济，尼雷尔总统在去年二月五日发表了《阿鲁沙宣言》，宣布自力更生政策是国家发展的指导方针。在这之后，立即宣布把全部外国银行（其中有三家英国银行和两家美国银行）、八家大面粉厂和八大进出口公司收归国有。同时，还掌握了另外七家大公司的大部分股票。
    坦桑尼亚的西沙尔麻产量占世界第一位。多年来，西沙尔麻是它的主要出口作物。但是，在长期殖民统治下，西沙尔麻工业完全控制在外国人手中，坦桑尼亚工人受尽虐待和剥削。在《阿鲁沙宣言》公布后不久，坦桑尼亚政府便把六家较大的西沙尔麻公司收归国有，并掌握了其它三十三家西沙尔麻公司的大部分股票，从而使坦桑尼亚政府控制了坦桑尼亚百分之六十以上的西沙尔麻工业。
    去年八月，桑给巴尔也宣布把岛上的对外贸易收归国有，由政府直接掌握长期被私商操纵的桑给巴尔的重要的进出口业。
    与此同时，坦桑尼亚人民在《阿鲁沙宣言》的鼓舞下，还建立了一些新的工业。
    坦桑尼亚基本上是一个农业国，坦桑尼亚人民有百分之九十五住在农村地区，靠农业生活。所以，《阿鲁沙宣言》特别强调要发展农业生产。去年十月，坦噶尼喀非洲民族联盟在姆万扎举行的全国会议上又讨论了农业发展问题。尼雷尔总统在会上发表讲话时，号召坦桑尼亚农民使用牛耕犁和其它改良农具，来代替原始工具，增加农业产量，提高生活水平。为适应坦桑尼亚农业改造的需要，目前，中国援助的农具厂的建设工作，正在积极进行中。这种工厂建成后每年能够生产大量的牛耕犁等各种农具。
    为了自力更生地发展民族经济，坦桑尼亚政府在一九六四年六月同中国政府本着平等互利、真诚合作的精神，签订了经济技术合作协定。目前，由中国援助坦桑尼亚建设的鲁弗国营农场和友谊纺织印染厂等工农业项目，在坦桑尼亚工人和中国技术人员的共同努力下，有的已经完工投入生产，有的很快也即将建成。这些项目的建成，有助于坦桑尼亚人民做到粮食和布匹的自给。去年九月，坦桑尼亚政府和赞比亚政府又同中国政府在北京签订了一项关于中国援助修建坦桑尼亚—赞比亚铁路的协定。最近，第一批坦桑尼亚—赞比亚铁路勘察和设计小组的中国技术人员已经到达坦桑尼亚，开始了工作。
    在发展民族文化方面，坦桑尼亚政府也采取了一些措施。废除了殖民主义时期在教育方面对非洲人的一切种族歧视，中小学生人数有了显著增加。从今年开始，坦桑尼亚的国语斯瓦希利语，已作为教学的主要语文，正在全国几乎所有的小学推行。与此同时，坦桑尼亚政府还注意发扬民族文化的优良传统和消除腐朽的帝国主义和殖民主义的文化影响。
    坦桑尼亚人民巩固政治独立、发展民族经济和文化的事业，必将不断取得胜利，帝国主义、殖民主义者阻碍坦桑尼亚人民前进的任何罪恶阴谋，都必将遭到可耻的破产。
