Peasants in Houzhangliang Brigade of Changliang Commune in Hebei Province's Shuyuan County, with the help of the PLA's leftist support personnel, systematically criticized the revisionist garbage such as "work points as the commander" and ignited revolutionary enthusiasm, resulting in a new situation where labor is not calculated for rewards, work is not done with conditions, and everyone competes to take on heavy burdens.

The PLA's leftist support personnel in Houzhangliang Brigade of Changliang Commune in Hebei Province's Shuyuan County, following Chairman Mao's instructions on peasants also criticizing the bourgeoisie, actively helped the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to deeply carry out revolutionary criticism. They systematically criticized the revisionist garbage such as "work points as the commander" promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and guided the commune members to spark a revolution in their souls, gradually establishing the thought of farming for the revolution. Many moving deeds of wholeheartedly serving the collective and completely and thoroughly for the revolution emerged, powerfully promoting the development of agricultural production and various tasks.

Eliminating the Poison of "Work Points as the Commander"

In the past, Houzhangliang Brigade was influenced by the revisionist garbage such as "work points as the commander" and "material incentives" promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev. When implementing the political scoring system, some commune members were afraid of changing the old work-point scoring system, lowering the work-point standard, and reducing personal income; some cadres were also concerned that implementing the new scoring method would affect the commune members' work enthusiasm.

The leftist support personnel, following Chairman Mao's great instructions on "without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism, is revolution," organized the commune members to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the article "The Struggle Between the Two Roads in the Chinese Countryside," and combined it with the local situation to launch a large-scale exposure and criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist garbage such as "work points as the commander" and "material incentives." One production team, during the spring farming season last year, did not emphasize proletarian politics but started by increasing work points, which resulted in a few commune members pursuing more work points, working hastily, seeking quick results, and not paying attention to quality, causing losses to production. Another production team, following Chairman Mao's instructions, emphasized proletarian politics, criticized the idea of "work points as the commander," and both revolution and production went well. Everyone combined living examples to carry out revolutionary criticism, listing six major crimes for "work points as the commander" and "material incentives": fostering capitalist tendencies, harming the interests of the collective economy, impacting the study of Mao Zedong Thought, poisoning the souls of the commune member masses, damaging the relationship between cadres and the masses, and affecting the unity among commune members.

On this basis, the leftist support personnel further guided everyone to recognize that the essence of the Chinese Khrushchev promoting "work points as the commander" was to destroy the socialist system and the dictatorship of the proletariat. "Politics as the commander" or "work points as the commander" is essentially a struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines. The purpose of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party promoting "work points as the commander" is to let bourgeois politics "take the lead." Through revolutionary criticism, everyone voluntarily abolished the old work-point scoring system and implemented the Dazhai-style political scoring system.

After implementing the political scoring system, a handful of class enemies eagerly jumped out again to advocate for "work points as the commander" and "material incentives." They spread rumors saying, "Political scoring has evaluated away people's initiative!" At this time, the leftist support personnel organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's instructions on the poor and lower-middle peasants having "a kind of enthusiasm for the socialist road" and used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to severely criticize the ghost talk spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of class enemies. Everyone clearly saw: initiative has class characteristics. The Chinese Khrushchev used "work points" to "stimulate" production initiative. This initiative is definitely not socialist initiative but capitalist initiative. It lures the poor and lower-middle peasants into the capitalist dead end, serving the Chinese Khrushchev's plot to restore capitalism. Only by emphasizing proletarian politics and letting Mao Zedong Thought take the lead can the initiative of the poor and lower-middle peasants to carry out socialist revolution and socialist construction be mobilized. Through revolutionary criticism, the minds of the broad masses of commune members became more awake, and the direction of struggle became clearer. They angrily said: The Chinese Khrushchev's plot to restore capitalism is a delusion! We must greatly carry forward the socialist revolutionary initiative and follow Chairman Mao to the end of the revolution! They used revolutionary criticism to ignite revolutionary enthusiasm, promoting production and creating a new situation where labor is not calculated for rewards, work is not done with conditions, and everyone competes to take on heavy burdens. The three livestock keepers in the third production team, who were originally assigned two grass-cutting workers, greatly ignited their revolutionary enthusiasm after carrying out revolutionary criticism and voluntarily took on the task of cutting grass.

Establishing the Thought of Farming for the Revolution

Chairman Mao taught: "We must struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism." The leftist support personnel understood from Chairman Mao's instructions: revolutionary criticism is a great classroom for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism. Only by helping the commune members to break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness in the process of revolutionary criticism, achieving ideological revolutionization, can we fundamentally resist the influence and poisoning of revisionism and firmly establish the thought of farming for the revolution.

Therefore, the deeper the revolutionary criticism went, the more the leftist support personnel paid attention to insisting on the four firsts, firmly grasping living thoughts, and guiding the commune members to spark a revolution in their souls. For example, some people still had incorrect understandings about the work-point issue, thinking that doing a little more work should increase "extra" work points, which is "reasonable." The leftist support personnel believed that this "reasonable" idea is still a reflection of "work points as the commander," indicating that some people have not yet firmly established the thought of farming for the revolution.

Regarding these issues, the leftist support personnel helped everyone to study Chairman Mao's works and the brilliant "Three Articles" with questions in mind. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants further raised their socialist awareness and said: "According to labor" and "more labor, more pay" are the principles of socialist distribution. However, if we first think of earning more work points instead of participating in collective labor for the revolution, this is the "selfishness" at work. The Chinese Khrushchev peddled many revisionist goods. If we do not overcome the "selfishness" in our minds, we will fall into his trap again. Old poor peasant Zhou Guoqing from the third team is the only carpenter in the team. In the past, he always earned double work points, thinking it was "more labor, more pay" and "reasonable." After revolutionary criticism and recalling bitterness and sweetness, he raised his class awareness and realized that "work points as the commander" is a "hallucinogenic potion" that leads people to the capitalist road, a bloodless soft knife; poor and lower-middle peasants doing more for the collective is their own responsibility. From then on, he no longer earned double work points and actively did carpentry work for the team in his spare time. He said: "'Work points as the commander' is 'selfishness as the commander,' farming for work points is farming for 'selfishness.' Poor and lower-middle peasants working only to earn work points is themselves undermining the socialist wall and harming the collective economy of the people's commune." The broad masses of commune members took him as an example, examining the influence of "work points as the commander" from the depths of their souls, eliminating the poison of revisionism, fiercely struggling against selfish thoughts, and firmly establishing the proletarian stance and the thought of farming for the revolution.

    深入开展革命大批判肃清修正主义流毒
    灵魂深处爆发革命树立为革命种田思想
    河北沽源县长梁公社后长梁大队贫下中农在解放军支左人员帮助下，系统地批判了“工分挂帅”等修正主义黑货，激发起革命干劲，出现劳动不计报酬、干活不讲条件、人人争挑重担的新气象
    本报讯　中国人民解放军驻河北省沽源县长梁公社后长梁大队支左人员，遵照毛主席关于农民“也要批判资产阶级”的教导，积极帮助广大贫下中农深入开展革命大批判，系统地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫“工分挂帅”等修正主义黑货，并引导社员在灵魂深处爆发革命，逐步树立为革命种田的思想，涌现出许多一心为集体、完全彻底为革命的动人事迹，有力地推动了农业生产和各项工作的开展。
    肃清“工分挂帅”的流毒
    后长梁大队过去受了中国赫鲁晓夫推行的“工分挂帅”、“物质刺激”等修正主义黑货的一些影响。当推行政治评分制时，有些社员怕改掉旧的评工记分制，降低工分标准，减少个人收入；也有的干部担心实行新的记分法，会影响社员的劳动情绪。
    支左人员遵照毛主席关于“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命”的伟大教导，组织社员反复学习毛主席的最新指示和《中国农村两条道路的斗争》一文，联系本地的实际情况，对中国赫鲁晓夫的“工分挂帅”、“物质刺激”等黑货展开大揭发大批判。有一个生产队去年春季农忙，没有突出无产阶级政治，而是一开始就加高工分，结果助长了少数社员的工分观念，干活贪多、求快、争分、不讲质量，给生产带来了损失。而另一个生产队遵照毛主席的教导，突出无产阶级政治，批判了“工分挂帅”的思想，革命和生产都搞得很好。大家结合活生生的事例开展革命大批判，给“工分挂帅”、“物质刺激”列出了六大罪状：助长了资本主义的倾向，损害了集体经济的利益，冲击了毛泽东思想的学习，毒害了社员群众的灵魂，搞坏了干群之间的关系，影响了社员之间的团结。
    在这个基础上，支左人员又进一步引导大家认清了中国赫鲁晓夫推行“工分挂帅”的要害，是破坏社会主义制度，破坏无产阶级专政。“政治挂帅”还是“工分挂帅”，实质上是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争。党内最大的一小撮走资派推行“工分挂帅”的目的，是要资产阶级政治“挂帅”。通过革命的大批判，大家自觉地废除了旧的评工记分制，实行了大寨式的政治评分制。
    实行政治评分制后，一小撮阶级敌人又迫不及待地跳了出来，为“工分挂帅”、“物质刺激”举幡招魂。他们造谣说：“政治评分把人的积极性评掉啦！”这时，支左人员就组织大家学习了毛主席关于贫下中农“有一种走社会主义道路的积极性”的教导，以毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫和一小撮阶级敌人散布的鬼话。大家清楚地看到：积极性是有阶级性的。中国赫鲁晓夫用“工分”来“刺激”生产积极性，这种积极性决不是社会主义的积极性，而是资本主义的积极性，它引诱贫下中农往资本主义的死胡同里跑，是为中国赫鲁晓夫搞资本主义复辟服务的。只有突出无产阶级政治，用毛泽东思想挂帅，才能调动贫下中农进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设的积极性。通过革命的大批判，广大社员的头脑更加清醒，斗争的方向更加明确。他们气愤地说：中国赫鲁晓夫阴谋搞资本主义复辟，这是妄想！我们要大大发扬社会主义革命的积极性，跟着毛主席他老人家革命到底！他们用革命大批判激发起来的革命干劲促进了生产，出现了劳动不计报酬、干活不讲条件、人人争挑重担的新气象。第三生产队的三个饲养员，过去专配两个铡草工，开展革命大批判后，大大激发了他们的革命干劲，主动地承担了铡草任务。
    树立为革命种田的思想
    毛主席教导说：“要斗私，批修”。支左人员从毛主席的教导中领会到：革命大批判，是活学活用毛泽东思想斗私批修的大课堂。只有帮助社员在革命大批判的过程中破私立公，实现思想革命化，才能从根本上抵制修正主义的影响和毒害，牢固地树立起为革命种田的思想。
    因此，革命大批判越深入，支左人员越注意坚持四个第一，狠抓活思想，引导社员在灵魂深处爆发革命。如有的人在工分问题上还有不正确的认识，认为多干一点点活，就要增加“额外”的工分，是“合情合理”的。支左人员认为，这种“合情合理”的想法，仍是“工分挂帅”的一种反映，说明有些人还没有牢固地树立起为革命种田的思想。
    针对这些问题，支左人员又帮助大家带着问题学习毛主席著作，学习光辉的“老三篇”，广大贫下中农进一步提高了社会主义觉悟，他们说：“按劳分配”“多劳多得”，这是社会主义分配原则。但是，如果我们首先想到的是为了多挣工分，而不是为革命多参加集体劳动，这就是“私”字作怪。中国赫鲁晓夫贩卖了许多修正主义的黑货，如果不克服头脑中的“私”字，以后还会上他的鬼圈套。三队老贫农周国清，是队里唯一的木匠，过去他一直挣双份工，他认为这是“多劳多得”、“合情合理”的。通过革命大批判和忆苦思甜之后，他提高了阶级觉悟，认识到“工分挂帅”是把人们引向资本主义道路的“迷魂汤”，是杀人不见血的软刀子；贫下中农多为集体出点力，是自己应尽的责任。从此以后，他再也不挣双份工了，并且在工余时间积极地给队里作木工活。他说：“‘工分挂帅’就是‘私’字挂帅，为工分干就是为‘私’字干。贫下中农干活光想谋工分，这是自己拆社会主义墙脚，损害人民公社集体经济。”广大社员以他为榜样，从灵魂深处查“工分挂帅”的影响，清除修正主义的流毒，狠斗私心杂念，坚定了无产阶级立场和为革命种田的思想。
