According to reports from Western news agencies, in front of the gates of the Renault automobile factory in Paris, a crowd of enthusiastic workers and students were engaged in a heated debate with the leaders of the French revisionist General Confederation of Labor, who had come to obstruct their struggle. These scabs, frightened by the revolutionary mass movement, revealed their ugly selves during the debate, earning the contempt of the workers and students.

In the crowd, a Paris University student had a revealing conversation with a French revisionist labor leader:

The student firmly stated, "We should carry on vigorously."

The scab replied, "We can't do that."

"Why not?" the student asked sternly.

The scab stammered, "Because the working class will have to pay the price later. That's why we can't do it. ... You are challenging the authorities. Your slogans are frightening everyone."

Hearing his words, one can almost see his face. The scab's ugly demeanor was vividly portrayed.

Barking Watchdogs

Not long ago, in the suburbs of Paris, a militant leaflet calling for a "revolutionary strike" appeared. This terrified the French revisionist traitors and scabs. The French revisionist *L'Humanité* hurriedly published an article titled "Beware." This short piece vividly depicted the traitorous face of the French revisionist group. See for yourself:

"In the Paris suburbs, leaflets advocating a 'revolutionary strike' have been discovered. Needless to say, such calls are not made by unions and democratic organizations. This is a plot by provocateurs, whose aim is to give the government an excuse to suppress. Workers must be vigilant to thwart such plots."

The French revisionist group claims to "support" the workers' struggle, but it is terrified of the revolutionary actions of workers and students, hating them to the core, labeling them as "plots" and "provocateurs," and insisting on "crushing" them. Isn't this hypocritical support and true betrayal exposed?

Revisionists are the watchdogs of the bourgeoisie. This article titled "Beware" is not a warning to revolutionary people to beware of the sabotage and suppression by the monopoly bourgeoisie, but it actually reminds the ruling class to beware of the revolutionary actions of the people. This article is nothing but the barking of a watchdog.

The Tragedy of Traitors

The Soviet revisionist *Pravda* reported on the Paris student demonstration on the night of May 23rd, first viciously cursing the Paris students for "acting recklessly," and then wrote: "Thus, that night in the Latin Quarter, a tragedy unfolded: barricades, fires, tear gas, police batons, and dozens of injuries." This reporter used a series of vague terms to try to make people believe that the students' struggle was a "tragedy."

However, the facts of that night were: ten thousand Paris students, fearless and full of fighting spirit, held a grand demonstration. They built barricades nine feet high and bravely fought against the police who were using batons and tear gas to suppress them. They also lit dozens of fires, and the flames illuminated the night of Paris in battle...

Was this a "tragedy"? No! This was a vivid and magnificent drama performed by Paris students on the stage of history.

"Revolution is the great festival of the oppressed and exploited." However, the Soviet revisionists saw it as a "tragedy." The fear of the traitors, who were terrified by the revolutionary storm, was fully revealed.

    看工贼丑恶嘴脸
    胆小鬼出丑
    据西方通讯社报道：在巴黎雷诺汽车厂大门前，聚集着情绪激昂的工人和学生，他们正在同前来阻挠他们坚持斗争的法修总工会头目进行激烈辩论。这些被革命群众运动吓破胆的工贼，在辩论时丑态百出，引起工人和学生的鄙视。
    在人群中，一位巴黎大学学生和一个法修工会头目进行了一次颇能说明问题的对话：
    这位学生坚决地说：“我们应该大力地干下去。”
    这个工贼回答：“不能那么干。”
    “为什么不能？”学生严正地提出质问。
    这个工贼嗫嗫嚅嚅地说：“因为工人阶级以后得付出代价。这就是不能那样干的原因。……你们是在跟政权较量呀。你们用你们的口号使每个人都感到害怕。”
    闻其声如见其人。工贼的丑态，活灵活现。
    看门狗狂吠
    不久前，在巴黎近郊，出现了号召举行“暴动罢工”的战斗性的传单。这可吓坏了法修叛徒和工贼。法修《人道报》急急忙忙抛出一篇题为《提防》的奇文。这短短的几行文字，活生生地勾划出法修集团的一副叛徒嘴脸。且看：
    “在巴黎郊区已发现建议举行‘暴动罢工’的传单。不用说，这样的呼吁不是工会和民主组织发出的。这是挑衅者的阴谋，他们的目的是要给予政府以进行镇压的借口。工人们应善于保持警惕，以便粉碎这类阴谋。”
    法修集团不是口口声声表示“支持”工人斗争吗？可是它对于工人和学生的革命行动却又这样怕得要命，恨之入骨，斥之为“阴谋”、“挑衅者”，必欲“粉碎”而后快。这种假支持、真叛卖的丑恶面目不是昭然若揭了吗。
    修正主义者是资产阶级的看门狗。这篇题为《提防》的奇文，不是要革命人民去“提防”垄断资产阶级的破坏和镇压，而实际上是提醒统治集团要“提防”革命人民的革命行动。这篇奇文不过是这条看门狗的狂吠而已。
    叛徒的悲哀
    苏修《真理报》报道五月二十三日晚上巴黎学生示威游行时，首先恶毒地咒骂巴黎学生“胡作非为”，接着写道：“于是，这一夜在拉丁区发生了一场悲剧：街垒、大火、催泪弹、警察使的警棍、几十人受伤。”这位记者用了一串含糊其辞的名词，企图使人相信学生的斗争是“一场悲剧”。
    然而，那天晚上的事实是：一万巴黎学生，不畏强暴，斗志昂扬，举行大示威。他们筑起高达九英尺的街垒，同使用警棍和催泪弹进行疯狂镇压的警察英勇搏斗。他们还燃起几十堆火，大火熊熊，照亮战斗的巴黎之夜……
    这难道是什么“悲剧”？不！这是巴黎学生在历史舞台上演出的一幕有声有色、威武雄壮的戏剧。
    “革命是被压迫者和被剥削者的盛大节日”。然而，苏修却把它看成是“悲剧”。被革命风暴吓破胆的叛徒的悲哀，充分流露了出来。
