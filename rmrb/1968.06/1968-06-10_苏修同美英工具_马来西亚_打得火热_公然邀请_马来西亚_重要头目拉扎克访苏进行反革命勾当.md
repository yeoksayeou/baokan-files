The Soviet revisionists are in close collaboration with the U.S.-British puppet "Malaysia." They openly invited the important leader of "Malaysia," Razak, to visit the Soviet Union to engage in counter-revolutionary activities.

New China News Agency reports: According to news from Moscow, at the arrangement of the Soviet revisionist clique, a leader of the Rahman puppet regime of the U.S.-British imperialists' tool "Malaysia," Razak, recently visited the Soviet Union. This is the first time since the Soviet revisionist clique established so-called "diplomatic relations" with "Malaysia" last year that they have formally invited an important leader of the Rahman puppet regime to "visit" the Soviet Union. This indicates that the Soviet revisionist clique and this puppet regime are further tightening their counter-revolutionary collusion.

According to TASS, during the visit of the "Malaysian" "Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense" Razak from May 23 to 25, Soviet revisionist leaders Podgorny, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Novikov, and Foreign Minister Gromyko separately held secret talks with him on "further developing relations between the Soviet Union and Malaysia" and "certain international issues of mutual concern," especially the so-called "peace issue in Southeast Asia." According to Western news agencies, one of the important topics discussed during this meeting was the issue of the Soviet Union providing weapons to "Malaysia" to suppress the people's struggle. Razak had previously expressed in a press conference in London on May 10 that the Rahman puppet regime is prepared to purchase weapons from the Soviet revisionists. He said that during his visit to Moscow, he "will definitely discuss this matter with the Russians." He praised the Soviet revisionist clique, saying: "We have no prejudice against Russian weapons. We are friends with the Russians."

On May 25, before leaving Moscow for his return to his country, Razak made a statement at the airport, expressing his satisfaction with the results of his talks with the Soviet revisionist leadership. He said, "This visit was successful." This indicates that the collusion between the Soviet revisionist clique and the "Malaysia" puppet regime has made new progress.

In recent years, the Soviet revisionist clique, out of their counter-revolutionary needs, has been increasingly tightening its collusion with the Rahman puppet regime, and at the end of last year, established "ambassadorial-level diplomatic relations" with it to strengthen its counter-revolutionary alliance with U.S. imperialism, to cooperate with the U.S. in forming an anti-China encirclement, and to intensify the suppression of the national liberation movements of the peoples of Southeast Asia. Since the beginning of this year, the Soviet revisionists, in collusion with U.S. imperialism, have been intensifying the organization of the so-called Southeast Asia "regional cooperation" against China, against communism, and against the people, further advancing their collusion with "Malaysia." Their invitation for Razak to make an "official visit" to the Soviet Union is a new step in this regard. The British Observer on May 26 published a commentary pointing out that Razak's visit to the Soviet Union opened a channel for the Soviet revisionists' "new political strategy" of "courting" those regimes in Southeast Asia that are hostile to China. The commentary revealed that the Soviet revisionists are "particularly concerned" about "Malaysia's" foreign policy and expressed their desire to "strengthen contact" with "Malaysia" to counter the so-called "Chinese pressure." This clearly exposes the counter-revolutionary nature of the Soviet revisionists' collusion with "Malaysia."

    苏修同美英工具“马来西亚”打得火热
    公然邀请“马来西亚”重要头目拉扎克访苏进行反革命勾当
    新华社讯　莫斯科消息：应苏修叛徒集团的安排，美英帝国主义的工具“马来西亚”拉赫曼傀儡集团的一个头目拉扎克，最近到苏联活动。这是苏修叛徒集团去年同“马来西亚”正式建立所谓“外交关系”以来，第一次正式邀请拉赫曼傀儡集团的重要头目“访问”苏联。它表明了苏修集团同这个傀儡集团之间正在进一步加紧反革命勾结。
    据塔斯社报道，在“马来西亚”的“副总理兼国防部长”拉扎克五月二十三日到二十五日访苏期间，苏修头目波德戈尔内、部长会议副主席诺维科夫和外交部长葛罗米柯，分别同他就“进一步发展苏联同马来西亚之间的关系”以及“双方关心的某些国际问题”，特别是所谓“东南亚的和平问题”进行了秘密会谈。据西方通讯社透露，这次会谈中的一个重要议题，是苏联向“马来西亚”提供镇压人民斗争的武器的问题。拉扎克五月十日在伦敦的一次记者招待会上就曾经表示，拉赫曼傀儡集团准备向苏修购买武器。他说，他这次访问莫斯科时“肯定会同俄国人讨论”这件事。他夸奖苏修集团说：“我们对俄国的武器没有偏见。我们同俄国人是朋友。”
    五月二十五日，拉扎克在离莫斯科回国以前在机场上发表谈话，对他同苏修领导集团这次“会谈的结果表示满意”。他说，“这次访问是成功的”。这表明，苏修叛徒集团同“马来西亚”傀儡集团之间的勾结又有了新的进展。
    最近几年，苏修集团出于它们的反革命需要，步步加紧同拉赫曼傀儡集团的勾结，并于去年年底同它建立了“大使级外交关系”，以加强同美帝国主义的反革命同盟，配合美帝拼凑反华包围圈，加紧镇压东南亚各国人民的民族解放运动。今年年初以来，苏修协同美帝加紧组织反华、反共、反人民的所谓东南亚“区域性合作”，又把它们同“马来西亚”的勾结推进了一步。它们这次邀请拉扎克“正式访问”苏联，就是在这方面所采取的新步骤。英国《观察家报》五月二十六日发表的一篇评论指出，拉扎克这次访苏，为苏修在东南亚地区“拉拢”那些敌视中国的政权的“新政治战略打开了通道”。评论透露，苏修“特别关心‘马来西亚’的对外政策”，表示要同“马来西亚”“加强接触”，以抵消所谓“中国的压力”。这就清楚地暴露了苏修集团同“马来西亚”勾结的反革命本质。
