Shanghai's steel industry workers, in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fiercely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pursued by China's Khrushchev, and brought about a completely new look in the city's steel production.

In the past two years, the varieties of new steel and new steel materials that Shanghai has successfully developed are unprecedented in history in terms of their quantity, level, and speed. Ordinary low-alloy steel, which is currently being vigorously developed in our country, is a new product with higher strength, better toughness, and better wear and corrosion resistance than ordinary carbon steel. Many steel mills in Shanghai have already started mass production. Many new varieties of steel materials with ultra-high strength, excellent atmospheric corrosion resistance, low-temperature resistance, and good magnetic properties have also been successfully developed one after another. These new types of steel materials can be used in construction projects, where one ton can replace two tons; used to produce steel ropes, extending their service life by about one fold; or used to produce electric motors, significantly reducing their size. At the same time, Shanghai's rolling steel industry has also successfully developed a large number of special-shaped steel materials and special steels for specific purposes, meeting the needs of industrial and agricultural production and national defense construction.

    上海钢铁战线制成大批新钢种新钢材
    上海钢铁工业战线广大革命职工在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，高举毛泽东思想的革命批判的大旗，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的反革命修正主义路线，推动全市钢铁工业生产面貌焕然一新。
    两年来，上海试制成功的新钢种和新钢材，品种之多，水平之高，速度之快，都是历史上从没有过的。我国正在大力发展的普通低合金钢，是一种比普通碳素钢强度高，韧性好，耐磨、耐腐蚀性能好的新产品，目前上海许多钢铁厂已开始大量生产。许多具有超高强度的、耐大气腐蚀性能的、耐低温的、导磁性能较好的新品种钢材，也已相继试制成功。这些新型的钢材，有的用于建筑工程，一吨可顶两吨用；有的用来生产钢丝绳，使用寿命可以延长一倍左右；有的用来生产电动机，体积可以大大缩小。在这同时，上海轧钢工业还试制成功了大批具有特殊用途的异型钢材、特种钢材，适应了工农业生产和国防建设的需要。
