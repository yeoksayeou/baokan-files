	Newspaper: "Voice of the Thai People" radio station broadcast an article on the 14th, enthusiastically hailing the rapid development and growth of the armed forces of the Meo people in northern Thailand under the leadership of the Thai Communist Party, which has dealt a heavy blow to the U.S.-Thanom reactionary clique.

	The article said, the Meo people and their armed forces, flexibly and effectively applying Chairman Mao Zedong's theory of people's war, have repeatedly smashed the counterrevolutionary "encirclement" of the U.S.-Thanom clique. According to the Thanom-Baiboon traitorous clique's admission, in the past year alone, in the provinces of Nan and Chiang Rai, the Meo people's armed forces have annihilated over 400 U.S.-Thai reactionary soldiers and police, shot down and damaged several enemy planes, and seized a batch of weapons.

	The article said, the continuous victories and rapid development of the Meo people's armed forces have brought about a tremendous change in the revolutionary situation in the north, and have powerfully supported the struggle of the people and the armed forces nationwide.

	The article said, under the dark reactionary rule of the U.S.-Thanom clique, the people of all nationalities in Thailand are suffering deeply. At this critical moment of national calamity, the Thai Communist Party has brought light and revolutionary truth to the people of all nationalities in Thailand, enabling the Meo people and other nationalities to realize that to completely rid themselves of the oppression and exploitation of the U.S.-Thanom clique, they must take up arms and join the revolutionary struggle with the people of the whole country. Only by driving out the American aggressors from Thailand, overthrowing the Thanom-Baiboon clique, and establishing a government that truly represents the interests of all nationalities, can the minority nationalities achieve genuine liberation.

	The article said, no matter how frantically the U.S.-Thanom clique suppresses and plays any despicable tricks of deception, it cannot stop the revolutionary tide of the Meo people. The revolutionary armed struggle of the Meo people and other nationalities will make increasingly great contributions to the cause of national democratic revolution to drive out the American aggressors and overthrow the Thanom-Baiboon traitorous clique.

    灵活运用人民战争战略战术　粉碎美泰集团反革命“围剿”
    泰共领导的北部苗族人民武装发展壮大
    新华社十五日讯　“泰国人民之声”电台十四日广播一篇文章，热烈欢呼泰国共产党领导下的泰国北部苗族人民武装迅速发展壮大，沉重地打击了美国—他侬反动集团。
    文章说，苗族人民和人民武装，灵活有效地运用了毛泽东主席的人民战争理论，一次又一次地粉碎了美国—他侬集团的反革命“围剿”。据他侬—巴博卖国集团供认，在近一年的时间里，仅在难府和清莱府，苗族人民武装共消灭了美泰反动军警四百多人，打落打伤敌机多架，缴获武器一批。
    文章说，苗族人民武装不断取得胜利和迅速发展壮大，使北部革命形势起了巨大的变化，并有力地支援了全国人民和人民武装的斗争。
    文章说，在美国—他侬集团暗无天日的反动统治下，泰国各族人民正处于水深火热之中。在民族灾难深重的时刻，泰国共产党给泰国各族人民带来了光明，带来了革命的真理，使苗族人民和其他各族人民认识到，要彻底摆脱美国—他侬集团的压迫和剥削，只有拿起武器和全国人民一道进行革命斗争。只有把美国侵略者驱逐出泰国，推翻他侬—巴博集团，建立起一个真正代表各族人民利益的政府，少数民族才能够获得真正的解放。
    文章说，不管美国—他侬集团怎样疯狂镇压和玩弄任何卑鄙的欺骗阴谋，都决不能阻挡苗族人民的革命浪潮。苗族和其他各族人民的革命武装斗争，在为驱逐美帝侵略者和推翻他侬—巴博卖国集团而进行的民族民主革命事业中，必将作出越来越巨大的贡献。
