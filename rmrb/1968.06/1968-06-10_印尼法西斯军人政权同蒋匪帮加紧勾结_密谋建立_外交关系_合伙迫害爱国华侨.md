The Indonesian fascist military regime led by Suharto and Nasution has recently become even more brazen in following the U.S. imperialists' plot to create "two Chinas," intensifying their counter-revolutionary collusion with the Chinese people's enemy, the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

According to the Chiang clique's _Zhengxin News_, on June 3, the Indonesian fascist military regime and the Chiang Kai-shek clique are engaged in secretive and intense activities regarding the issue of "establishing diplomatic relations." The Chiang clique has decided to send its "Ambassador to Thailand," Dong Zongshan, as an unofficial diplomatic representative to Indonesia. The Indonesian fascist military regime has "agreed" to this decision. Previously, this Chiang clique newspaper revealed that the Indonesian fascist military regime and the Chiang Kai-shek clique's "diplomatic relations" would be established this year. Both sides "may initially set up consulates in Taipei and Jakarta to handle matters related to overseas Chinese and business, and then fully restore diplomatic relations at an appropriate time." According to the Associated Press, on May 27, Suharto approved the establishment of an Indonesian "Commercial Center," which will set up a "trade representative office" in Taiwan to "perform consular duties."

It is reported that the Indonesian reactionary government has recently decided to return all the property seized by the previous government to the Chiang clique leader Rao Boji.

Since Suharto, the Indonesian counter-revolutionary leader, seized the "presidential" seat on March 27 this year, he has hastened the pace of collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek clique. He dispatched a delegation led by his brother, Probo Sutowo, and right-wing general Suhardiman to Taiwan to jointly plot anti-communist, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary crimes with the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

During their activities in Taiwan, Suhardiman and Probo Sutowo, following Suharto's instructions, became close with the political corpse, Chiang Kai-shek, and his gang of thugs, publicly declaring that they wanted to "strengthen cooperation" with the Chiang clique to "move towards establishing diplomatic relations." They also secretly met with one of the Chiang clique's top spies, the "Chairman of the World Anti-Communist League," Gu Zhenggang, to plot the Chiang clique's assistance to the Indonesian fascist military regime in persecuting patriotic overseas Chinese in Indonesia and "suppressing communist activities." During their activities in Taiwan, this delegation also signed a "trade agreement" with the Chiang Kai-shek clique. In addition to stipulating that the Chiang clique would provide a $10 million loan to the Indonesian fascist military regime, the agreement also stipulated that both sides would set up "trade representative offices" in Jakarta and Taipei; the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime would allow the Chiang clique to exploit Indonesia's fisheries, forestry, and mining industries; and allow ships flying the Chiang clique's flag to dock at Indonesian ports, among other things.

Since then, ships from the Chiang clique and Indonesia have begun to travel between Taiwan and Indonesian ports. The collusion between Indonesia and the Chiang clique has become more frequent, and Chiang clique members hiding in Indonesia have become more rampant than ever.

    印尼法西斯军人政权同蒋匪帮加紧勾结
    密谋建立“外交关系”  合伙迫害爱国华侨
    据新华社八日讯　雅加达消息：以苏哈托—纳苏蒂安为首的印度尼西亚法西斯军人政权，最近更加明目张胆地追随美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋，加紧同中国人民公敌蒋介石匪帮进行反革命勾结。
    据蒋帮《征信新闻报》六月三日透露，印尼法西斯军人政权同蒋介石匪帮之间就“建立外交关系”问题，正在进行紧张的秘密活动。蒋帮已决定派遣它的“驻泰国大使馆公使”董宗山为驻印尼的“非正式外交代表”。印尼法西斯军人政权对蒋帮的这一决定“已表示同意”。在这以前，这家蒋帮报纸曾透露，印尼法西斯军人政权同蒋介石匪帮的“外交关系”，将在今年内建立。双方“可能初步在台北与雅加达设立领事馆，处理侨民及商务工作，待适当时机后，即全面恢复外交关系”。据美联社透露，五月二十七日苏哈托批准成立印尼“商业中心”，这个中心将在台湾设立“贸易代表机构”，“执行领事馆职务”。
    据报道，印尼反动政府最近还决定归还被前政府没收的蒋帮头目饶博基的全部财产。
    印尼反革命头目苏哈托今年三月二十七日靠刺刀爬上“总统”宝座以后，就迫不及待地加速了同蒋介石匪帮勾结的步伐。他派遣了由他的弟弟普罗博·苏特佐和右派将领苏哈迪曼为首的“代表团”，到台湾同蒋介石匪帮共同策划反共、反人民、反革命的罪恶勾当。
    苏哈迪曼和普罗博·苏特佐在台湾活动期间，按照苏哈托的旨意，同被中国人民早已唾弃的政治僵尸蒋介石及其狐群狗党打得火热，公开叫嚷要同蒋帮“加强合作”，“以迈向建交大道”。他们还同蒋帮大特务头子之一、“世界反共联盟理事会主席”谷正纲秘密会谈，就蒋帮协助印尼法西斯军人政权迫害旅居印尼的爱国华侨、“遏阻共党活动”等问题进行了阴谋策划。这个“代表团”在台湾活动期间，还同蒋介石匪帮签订了一个“贸易协定”。这个协定除了规定由蒋帮向印尼法西斯军人政权提供一千万美元贷款以外，还规定双方分别在雅加达和台北设立“贸易代表办事处”；苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权允许蒋帮开采印尼的渔业、林业和矿业；允许悬挂蒋帮狗牙旗的船只在印尼港口停泊，等等。
    此后，蒋帮和印尼的轮船就开始往来于台湾和印尼港口之间。印尼同蒋帮的勾结更加频繁，潜伏在印尼国内的蒋帮分子比以往更加猖獗起来。
