The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction means criticism, means revolution." "Only by destroying the old and rotten things can we build new and healthy things." The Red Star Production Brigade of Yongfa People's Commune in Bayan County, Heilongjiang Province, has undergone a profound change in the spiritual outlook of its members after a year of studying and applying Chairman Mao's thoughts. People's minds are focused on implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, their eyes are on class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, their energy is on "seizing the revolution and promoting production," and their steps are moving forward on the revolutionary path indicated by Chairman Mao. The practice of the Red Star Brigade proves that revolutionary criticism has become a powerful force driving the rural Cultural Revolution to develop deeply.

Conducting Thematic Criticism Closely Tied to the Unit's Struggle, Criticism, and Transformation

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the course of the movement, new things are constantly emerging. Studying the overall development of this movement and its development is a major topic that we must always pay attention to." After revolutionary criticism was launched, how to harness the momentum and drive it deeper and deeper requires following Chairman Mao's teachings and constantly studying. The revolutionary leading cadre of the Red Star Brigade and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants together drew an important experience from practice, which is to closely tie the thematic criticism to the unit's struggle, criticism, and transformation. They adopted the method of studying one of Chairman Mao's teachings, criticizing one of China Hoxha's reactionary fallacies, eliminating one stream of poison, and establishing one revolutionary thought to carry out revolutionary criticism. This way, the target and firepower are concentrated, making the revolutionary criticism deeper and deeper, forming a sustained revolutionary mass movement.

The first theme was to criticize China Hoxha's theory of "exploitation is meritorious." At the bitter-sweet remembrance meeting of the second team, the old poor peasant Wei Guangyu tearfully recounted the tragic history of his father dying in the landlord's mill and his mother being driven to death. This stirred up tears of hatred in many people. When Wei Guangyu spoke of how Chairman Mao saved his family from the abyss of suffering, enabling the three brothers who had been separated to reunite and live a happy life, everyone raised their fists and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in every household recalled their bitter experiences. Thinking of the past and looking at the present, everyone deeply hated China Hoxha and loved the great leader Chairman Mao. Everyone understood that China Hoxha's talk of "exploitation is meritorious" and "exploitation is not a crime" was to restore capitalism, making the poor and lower-middle peasants return to the old road of oppression and exploitation. Everyone resolutely declared to thoroughly criticize and expose China Hoxha's reactionary fallacies, forever following Chairman Mao in making the revolution. Through the thematic criticism, the commune members loved the collective more and became more determined to follow the socialist path.

After the first thematic criticism, the leading cadre of the Red Star Brigade realized that some people were poisoned by China Hoxha's theory of "exploitation is meritorious" because they neglected class struggle. Therefore, they followed up by criticizing China Hoxha's theory of "class struggle is extinguished" as the second theme. They organized the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to recall in segments the history of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in their local area and village over the past twenty years of liberation, exposing a large number of facts about the local class enemies' plots to usurp political power and restore capitalism. For example, the class enemies measured land boundaries, established accounts of changes, corrupted and seduced cadres, plotted to usurp leadership, and took the opportunity of the Cultural Revolution to stir up trouble, and so on. The first team had a counter-revolutionary who, although struggled by the revolutionary masses many times and confessed with his mouth, still prepared to counterattack in his heart. We tightened class struggle, and he became a "snake turned into a beautiful woman"; we relaxed class struggle, and he became a "snake showing its fangs." In the early days of the Cultural Revolution, he escaped to avoid the masses' supervision and reform, sneaking away. Some people said, "Let him run away, so we don't have to supervise him every day." In response to this thought, they organized the commune members to study Chairman Mao's teachings again: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not willingly accept their defeat. They will still struggle to the end. After the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disorder in various ways. They will try every day to restore their power in China. This is inevitable and undeniable. We must not relax our vigilance." At the same time, they severely criticized China Hoxha's theory of "class struggle is extinguished," and everyone brightened their eyes, heightened their vigilance against class struggle, and realized that letting a class enemy go was to encourage him to continue to sabotage the dictatorship of the proletariat. Therefore, the brigade sent two militiamen to drag this counter-revolutionary back and implement the dictatorship of the masses over him.

To walk the socialist path, one must block the capitalist alley. Therefore, the Red Star Brigade organized the poor and lower-middle peasant commune members to recall the history of collectivization, severely criticizing the fallacies of "four freedoms," "three selfs and one package," and advocating for "three horses, one plow, and one cart" style farmers. This was the third theme. The second team's commune members recalled that before collectivization, due to the poisoning of the "four freedoms," out of the more than twenty households in the village, three sold their land, and fifteen were re-exploited by usury. The poor and lower-middle peasants angrily said, "The 'four freedoms,' 'three selfs and one package,' and 'rich peasant economy' are like three knives hanging over the farmers' heads. We will not fall for China Hoxha's tricks." The poor peasant Chen Yonghai of the first team was deeply poisoned by China Hoxha's fallacy of developing the rich peasant economy. After criticizing these fallacies, he said, "Thanks to Chairman Mao's leadership, I was pulled out of the capitalist quagmire and walked the happy path of socialism. Otherwise, it would be very dangerous to develop further!" The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants said, "China Hoxha's advocated 'rich peasant economy' is a collapsing bridge; Chairman Mao's people's commune is a golden bridge. We must follow Chairman Mao's revolution to the end." On the basis of raising awareness, everyone thoroughly reformed the distribution method that did not emphasize politics and universally promoted the labor management experience of Dazhai.

The fourth thematic criticism was conducted on the basis of the previous three themes. China Hoxha's crimes are countless, but the most fundamental one is opposing Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. The Red Star Brigade mobilized the commune members to recall their personal growth history, severely criticize China Hoxha's shameless lies against Mao Zedong Thought, and praise the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, always holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

They took the active learners of Chairman Mao's works and militiamen as the backbone, through various meetings to recall the process of growth under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, extensively displaying the sweetness of studying Mao Zedong Thought and the bitterness of not studying it. The poor peasant Zhu Shuzhen of the first team was not very active in studying Chairman Mao's works in the past. After the revolutionary criticism, she became an active learner of Chairman Mao's works. She often braved the cold wind, endured the heavy snow, and in the dark, guided the elderly to the meeting place and helped the children's mothers carry their babies to the meeting. Now, reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and being a good soldier of Chairman Mao have become the highest standard and greatest wish of the broad masses of commune members.

In addition to organizing these four thematic criticisms, the Red Star Brigade also organized the broad masses of commune members, cadres, and militiamen to conduct thematic criticisms on "material incentives," "work points as the commander," and the "bourgeois military line," etc. Through one thematic criticism after another, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres greatly heightened their class consciousness and consciousness of the struggle between the two lines, further clarifying what is Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and what is the bourgeois reactionary line.

Combining the Struggle Against Self with the Criticism of Revisionism

How to deepen the revolutionary criticism and thoroughly eliminate the poison spread by China Hoxha and his agents in the countryside? An important link is to combine the struggle against self with the criticism of revisionism. This is another experience of the Red Star Brigade in deeply and sustainably carrying out revolutionary criticism.

To combine the struggle against self with the criticism of revisionism, the Red Star Brigade universally established Mao Zedong Thought study classes, mobilizing cadres to take the lead in struggling against self and criticizing revisionism. The brigade leader Yang Zhiguo of the first production team, in the revolutionary criticism, initially only criticized revisionism without struggling against self, and the problem could not be thoroughly solved, and the poison of revisionism could not be thoroughly eliminated. From this example, the leading cadre of the Red Star Brigade realized: the fundamental way to combine the struggle against self with the criticism of revisionism is to use the red arrow of Mao Zedong Thought to shoot at the two black targets of "self" and "revisionism," raising the excavated "self" and "revisionism" to the height of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines. Without struggling against self, people become revisionists; without criticizing revisionism, power becomes corrupted, and the country changes color. Only by combining the struggle against self with the criticism of revisionism can the struggle against self have a direction, and the criticism of revisionism can be deep. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants deeply felt: only criticizing revisionism without struggling against self, the criticism is not thorough, and it will recur when the opportunity arises. Therefore, under the leadership of the cadres, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants launched another high tide of struggling against self and criticizing revisionism.

The old poor peasant An Zhicai of the first team, in the previous period of revolutionary criticism, only turned his family into a battlefield for criticizing revisionism and did not thoroughly eliminate the poison of "self." One day, the brigade distributed corn stalks to his family, including some small bundles, and his two children said, "Other families are all big bundles, why do we only get small bundles? We don't want them!" In the evening, An Zhicai led the whole family to hold a struggle against self meeting, repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's teachings on "struggling against self and criticizing revisionism," realizing that seeking convenience is the crooked way of China Hoxha. At this time, An Zhicai led the whole family to study Vice Chairman Lin's instructions: "We must regard ourselves as a force of the revolution and at the same time constantly regard ourselves as the object of the revolution." Everyone said: Our family not only wants to be a revolutionary family for criticizing revisionism but also a revolutionary family for struggling against self. The whole family raised their awareness and happily accepted the corn stalks. Many poor and lower-middle peasants said with deep feelings: Revolutionary criticism must not be neglected; once neglected, the defeated class enemies will rise up to counterattack; once neglected, the "self" that has been struggled against will reappear. The old poor peasant Wei Guangyu said well, the deeper the struggle against self, the closer to Chairman Mao; the harsher the criticism of revisionism, the tighter the follow of Chairman Mao; with a heart for the public, the most loyal to Chairman Mao. The commune member Zhou Yunfeng of the first team picked up a package of apples on the road and guarded it for several hours until he handed it over to the owner before leaving. The masses praised him: "You are really good, truly the style of us poor and lower-middle peasants." He said, "This is what Chairman Mao told me to do."

Overcoming Relaxation and Carrying Out Revolutionary Criticism to the End

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Even if our work has achieved extremely great results, there is no reason to be proud and arrogant. Modesty makes one progress, arrogance makes one fall behind. We must always remember this truth."

The revolutionary criticism of the Red Star Brigade, starting from April last year, has developed step by step and achieved results. Some people said, "Our revolutionary criticism has achieved great results, and it's almost done." Others said, "We've had enough meetings, and it's time to relax a bit." Thus, some families and courtyard teams' revolutionary criticism meetings became slack, and some production teams' revolutionary criticism meetings were intermittent.

The brigade leading cadre, in response to these relaxation tendencies, timely organized cadres and commune members to seriously study Chairman Mao's relevant statements, using the highest standard of fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions to examine thoughts, feelings, and willpower. In the process of self-examination, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres listed facts of the recurrence of class struggle. For example, in the third team, there was a bad element who, although appeared to be honest, actually had not given up his evil intentions. He saw that the brigade's revolutionary criticism was slacking off and took the opportunity to come out and stir up trouble, currying favor with the brigade leader, lending money to the brigade leader, trying to pull the brigade leader down. The living facts made the cadres and commune members realize that class enemies would not be eliminated on their own, the poison of China Hoxha could not be eliminated at once, class struggle was complex and long-term, and revolutionary criticism could not be stopped.

The cadres and commune members raised their awareness, overcame the relaxation tendencies, and launched another campaign centered on criticizing the revisionist party-building line. The brigade leading members studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "The party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat and should be able to lead the proletariat and revolutionary masses to fight against the class enemies, a vigorous vanguard organization." They trained more than fifty backbone members, leading everyone to severely criticize China Hoxha's revisionist party-building line.

In the process of criticism, they adopted the methods of combining top and bottom, inside and outside the party, and general criticism with thematic criticism, universally establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Party members took the lead in eliminating the poison, and every household and team set up a revolutionary criticism battlefield. The Communist Party member Wang Fenggui of the third production team, with a family of fifteen, except for two very young children, all participated in the study class. The 67-year-old former party branch secretary Zhang Rong, although ill, insisted on participating in the criticism meeting every day, severely criticizing China Hoxha's revisionist party-building line.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of the Red Star Brigade, when reviewing the achievements of revolutionary criticism over the past year, unanimously said: This is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought! Everyone is determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, deeply and sustainably carry out revolutionary criticism, carry out the struggle between the two roads in the countryside to the end, carry out the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end, and turn the Red Star Brigade into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

    因势利导，把革命大批判步步引向深入
    ——黑龙江省巴彦县永发公社红星大队开展专题大批判的经验
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。”“只有破坏旧的腐朽的东西，才能建设新的健全的东西。”黑龙江巴彦县永发公社红星大队，经过一年来活学活用毛泽东思想，开展革命大批判，社员的精神面貌发生了极其深刻的变化。人们的心都往落实毛主席最新指示上想，眼往阶级斗争和两条路线斗争上看，劲往“抓革命，促生产”上使，步子朝着毛主席指引的革命化大道前进。红星大队的实践证明，革命大批判已经成为推动农村无产阶级文化大革命深入发展的强大动力。
    紧密结合本单位斗批改开展专题大批判
    毛主席教导我们：“运动在发展中，又有新的东西在前头，新东西是层出不穷的。研究这个运动的全面及其发展，是我们要时刻注意的大课题。”革命大批判开展起来之后，如何因势利导，使之步步深入，必须遵照毛主席的教导，时刻注意研究。红星大队革命领导班子和广大贫下中农一起，从实践中得出一条重要经验，就是密切结合本单位的斗批改，开展专题大批判。他们采用学习毛主席的一个教导，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的一个反动谬论，肃清一股流毒，树立一个革命思想的方法，开展革命大批判。这样做，目标集中，火力集中，使革命大批判步步深入，形成了持久的革命群众运动。
    第一个专题，就是批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“剥削有功”论。在第二队忆苦思甜大会上，老贫农魏广有含泪讲了父亲累死在地主的碾房里，母亲活活被逼死的血泪家史，使许多人流下了仇恨的眼泪。当魏广有讲到是毛主席他老人家把他一家从火坑里救出来，使流离失所的三兄弟得到团聚，过着幸福生活的时候，大家一次又一次地振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”广大贫下中农家家忆苦思甜。人们想想过去，看看今天，都无比痛恨中国赫鲁晓夫，无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席。大家懂得了中国赫鲁晓夫说什么“剥削有功”“剥削无罪”，就是要复辟资本主义，使贫下中农走回头路，重新受压迫受剥削。大家坚决表示要彻底批倒批臭中国赫鲁晓夫的反动谬论，永远跟着毛主席闹革命。通过开展专题大批判，社员更加热爱集体，更加坚定了走社会主义道路的信心。
    经过第一个专题大批判后，红星大队领导班子认识到，有人中了中国赫鲁晓夫“剥削有功”论的毒害，就是因为忽视了阶级斗争。所以接着把批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论作为第二个专题。他们组织广大贫下中农，一段一段地回忆解放二十年来本地本村两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的历史，揭出本地本村阶级敌人阴谋篡夺政权、复辟资本主义的大量事实。例如阶级敌人查地边，立变天账，拉拢腐蚀干部，阴谋篡夺领导权，乘无产阶级文化大革命之机兴风作浪，等等。第一队有个反革命分子，虽然被革命群众斗争了多次，嘴上认了罪，但心里还准备反扑。我们抓紧了阶级斗争，他就变成“化成美女的蛇”；我们放松了阶级斗争，他就变成“露出毒牙的蛇”。无产阶级文化大革命初期，他为了逃避群众的监督改造，偷偷地逃跑了。有的人说：“跑就跑了呗，省得整天监督他。”针对这种思想，他们组织社员又一次地学习了毛主席的教导：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”同时狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，大家擦亮了眼睛，提高了阶级斗争的警惕性，认识到放走一个阶级敌人，就是纵容他继续破坏无产阶级专政。于是，队上派了两个民兵把这个反革命分子揪了回来，对他实行群众专政。
    要走社会主义道路，必须把资本主义胡同堵死。因此，红星大队组织贫下中农社员忆集体化史，狠批“四大自由”、“三自一包”和鼓吹当“三马一犁一车式”农民的谬论，这是第三个专题。第二队社员回忆到合作化前，由于受“四大自由”的毒害，全屯二十几户中，有三户卖掉了土地，十五户重新受高利贷剥削。贫下中农气愤地说：“四大自由”、“三自一包”、“富农经济”，就是农民头上的三把刀，我们决不上中国赫鲁晓夫的当。一队贫农陈永海，受中国赫鲁晓夫发展富农经济的谬论毒害较深。批判这些谬论以后，他说：“多亏毛主席领导，使我从资本主义泥坑里拔了出来，走上了社会主义幸福路，不然发展下去很危险！”广大贫下中农说：“中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的‘富农经济’是座窟窿桥；毛主席的人民公社是座金桥。我们一定要跟毛主席革命到底。”在提高认识的基础上，大家对不突出政治的分配方法进行了彻底改革，并且普遍地推行了大寨的劳动管理经验。
    第四个专题批判，是在前三个专题的基础上进行的。中国赫鲁晓夫的罪行有千条万条，最根本的一条就是反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想。红星大队发动社员忆个人成长史，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫反对毛泽东思想的无耻谰言，颂扬战无不胜的毛泽东思想，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。
    他们以活学活用毛主席著作积极分子、民兵为骨干，通过各种会议回忆在毛泽东思想哺育下不断成长的过程，大摆学习毛泽东思想的甜头，不学毛泽东思想的苦头。一队祖淑珍过去学习毛主席著作不大积极，经过革命大批判以后，她成了活学活用毛主席著作的积极分子。她常常顶着寒风，冒着大雪，黑灯瞎火地给老大娘引路，给孩子妈妈抱小孩上会场。现在，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士，已经成了广大社员最高的准则、最大的愿望。
    红星大队除了组织这四个专题批判外，还组织广大社员、干部和民兵专题批判了“物质刺激”、“工分挂帅”、“资产阶级军事路线”等。通过一个一个专题批判，广大贫下中农和革命干部大大地提高了阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，进一步认清了什么是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，什么是资产阶级反动路线。
      把斗私和批修结合起来
    怎样把革命大批判深入下去，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在农村散布的流毒呢？很重要的一环是把斗私和批修结合起来。这是红星大队深入持久地开展革命大批判的另一条经验。
    为了把斗私和批修结合起来，红星大队普遍办起了毛泽东思想学习班，发动干部带头斗私批修。第一生产队队长杨志国，在革命大批判中，开始光批修不斗私，问题总是不能彻底解决，不能彻底肃清修正主义流毒。从这个例子中，红星大队的领导班子认识到：斗私和批修结合的根本途径，就是用毛泽东思想的红箭射“私”、“修”这两个黑靶，把挖出来的“私”字和“修”字提到两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的高度来认识。不斗私，人变修，不批修，权变质、国变色。只有把斗私和批修结合起来，斗私才有方向，批修才能批得深。广大贫下中农深有体会地说：光批修不斗私，批也批不彻底，一遇时机还要反复。因此，在干部的带动下，广大贫下中农又掀起了斗私批修的高潮。
    一队老贫农安志才，在前一时期革命大批判中，只是把家庭变成批修的战场，没有很好肃清“私”字的流毒。一天，队里给他家分包米秸子，其中有些小捆，他两个孩子说：“别人家都是大捆，为什么单给我们小捆，我们不要！”晚上，安志才领着全家开了斗私会，反复学习了毛主席关于“要斗私，批修”的教导，认识到贪便宜，那是中国赫鲁晓夫的歪道。这时，安志才又领着全家学习了林副主席的指示：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。”大家都说：我们这个家不但要成为批修的革命家庭，还要成为斗私的革命家庭。全家提高了认识，高兴地留下包米秸。许多贫下中农语重心长地说：“革命大批判撂荒不得，一撂荒，被打倒的阶级敌人就要爬起来反扑；一撂荒，斗掉的‘私’字就要重新露土。”老贫农魏广有说得好，斗私越深，对毛主席越亲；批修越狠，跟毛主席越紧；一心为公，对毛主席最忠。一队社员周云峰，在公路上拣到一包苹果，一直守了好几个钟头，直到交给失主才离开。群众赞扬他说：
  “你真是好样的，真是咱贫下中农的本色。”他说：“这是毛主席叫我这样做的。”
      克服松懈情绪，把革命大
    批判进行到底
    毛主席教导我们：“即使我们的工作得到了极其伟大的成绩，也没有任何值得骄傲自大的理由。虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后，我们应当永远记住这个真理。”
    红星大队的革命大批判，从去年四月份开始，步步深入发展，取得了成效。有的人说：“我们的革命大批判成绩大，搞得差不离了。”也有的人说：“大小会也没少开，该松一口气了。”这样，有的家庭和院套组的革命大批判会有些松劲，有的生产队革命大批判会也时断时续。
    大队领导班子针对这些松劲情绪，及时组织干部和社员认真学习毛主席有关论述，用全面落实毛主席最新指示的最高标准，查思想、查感情、查斗志。在对照检查过程中，广大贫下中农和革命干部列举了阶级斗争出现反复的事实。如三队有个坏分子，表面上老实了，实际上贼心不死，他看队里革命大批判松劲了，就乘机出来兴妖作怪，点头哈腰献殷勤，主动借钱给队长，企图拉队长下水。活生生的事实，使干部和社员认识到，阶级敌人是不会自行消灭的，中国赫鲁晓夫的流毒是不能一下子肃清的，阶级斗争是复杂的、长期的，革命大批判绝不能停顿。
    干部和社员提高了认识，克服了松劲情绪，一个以批判修正主义建党路线为中心内容的战役又打响了。大队领导成员学习了毛主席的教导：“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。”训练了五十多名骨干，带动大家狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线。
    在批判的过程中，他们采取了上下结合，党内外结合，一般批判和专题批判结合的办法，普遍地办起了毛泽东思想学习班。党员带头肃清流毒，家家、队队摆开革命大批判战场。第三生产队共产党员王凤奎一家十五口人，除去两个很小的孩子以外，全都参加了学习班。六十七岁的原党支部书记张荣，虽然身体有病，每天也都坚持参加批判会，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线。
    红星大队广大贫下中农和革命干部，在回顾一年来革命大批判所取得的成果时，都异口同声地说：这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！大家决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，深入持久地开展革命大批判，把农村两条道路斗争进行到底，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把红星大队办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
