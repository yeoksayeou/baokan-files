One morning, Zhang Laohui, the deputy director of the Revolutionary Committee of Longyao County, Hebei Province, suddenly moved his residence back from the original station director's office to his original small house. Why did Zhang Laohui move again?

The story is as follows: Zhang Laohui is an old worker from the county tractor station's oil depot. For many years, he has lived in a small house built with broken bricks and wooden planks. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Zhang Laohui led the revolutionary masses to fiercely criticize the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. When the Revolutionary Committee was established, everyone elected him as the deputy director of the county Revolutionary Committee. For the convenience of work, the leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations repeatedly urged him to move, but he refused. Later, everyone took the opportunity when he went to the Yanshan Revolutionary Committee for a meeting to move him into the original station director's office. When Zhang Laohui returned from Yanshan, he wanted to move back, but then he thought, "There are so many people coming to discuss work with me every day, living in a big house is also convenient." So he stayed.

One evening, after attending a standing committee meeting, Zhang Laohui thought about how he was born into a poor peasant family, grew up in the bitter waters of the old society, and it was Chairman Mao who saved him from the abyss of suffering, joining the revolution and the Party. Now, the revolutionary masses have selected him from an ordinary worker to be a member of the Yanshan Revolutionary Committee and deputy director of the county Revolutionary Committee. Chairman Mao teaches us: "We Communists are different in that we do not seek official posts, but we seek revolution." I have been the deputy director for only a few days, and I have already moved into the best house in the entire station. Isn't this a case of alienation from the masses? Alienation from the masses is a big problem. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The most fundamental aspect of reforming state organs is to connect with the masses." The more he thought about it, the more he felt that moving houses was a problem. At this moment, the scenes of moving houses before and after came to his mind: since moving into the original station director's office, he spent more time in the house and had less contact with the masses. This is not just a matter of moving houses; it is a matter of moving one's mind. The position has changed, but the mind cannot deteriorate; otherwise, one will alienate oneself from the masses and "comfortably" become a revisionist. After a struggle in his thoughts, Zhang Laohui finally moved back to his original small house.

    张老会搬家
    一天早晨，河北省隆尧县革委会副主任张老会，突然把自己的住处从原站长办公室又搬回了自己原来住的小屋里。张老会为什么又搬家？
    事情是这样的：张老会是县拖拉机站看油库的老工人，多年以来，一直住在自己用碎砖烂板垒起的一间小屋里。在无产阶级文化大革命中，张老会带领革命群众大造党内一小撮走资派的反。成立革命委员会时，大家选他当了县革命委员会副主任。为了工作方便，革命群众组织的负责人多次劝他搬家，他都拒绝了。后来，大家趁他到邢台地区革委会开会的机会，给他搬进了原站长办公室。老会从邢台回来，就想搬回去，可是又一想，成天找自己谈工作的人很多，住个大屋倒也方便。于是就住了下来。
    一天晚上，老会参加常委会回来，想起了自己是贫农出身，是在旧社会的苦水里长大的，是毛主席他老人家把自己从火坑里救了出来，参加了革命，入了党。现在革命群众把自己从一个普通工人，选为邢台地区革委会委员、县革委会副主任。毛主席教导说：“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命”。我当了副主任没几天，就搬进了全站最好的房屋，这不是脱离了群众吗？脱离群众可是个大问题。毛主席教导说：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”他越想，越觉得搬房子有问题。这时，搬房子前前后后的情景一幕一幕地浮在他的眼前：自搬进原站长办公室以来，自己在屋里的时间多了，接触群众少了。这不仅仅是搬房问题，这是思想搬家问题。地位变了思想不能变坏，否则脱离了群众，就会“舒舒服服”地变“修”。张老会经过了一番思想斗争，终于又搬回到自己原来的小屋里。
