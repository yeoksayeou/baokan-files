The militiamen and poor and lower-middle peasants of Songshuzhuang Production Brigade, Laoshan County, Shandong Province, with the help of the local garrison of the People's Liberation Army, have carefully analyzed and studied the new trends, new characteristics, and new problems of class struggle in the summer harvest distribution. Armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, taking Comrade Deng Hengtong, who is loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, as an example, they have hoisted the banner of revolutionary criticism high and resolutely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the distribution of grain. They have correctly handled the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual in the summer harvest distribution. Below is part of the speech by some militiamen at a big criticism meeting.

Someone said, "This year, the wheat harvest is good, and we can distribute and eat more grain." Zhang Shizhong, the first production team leader and militia squad leader, said: "No! We must consider the overall situation and understand the big picture, not just personal immediate interests."

We must: Have a heart for the country and an eye for the world.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the matter of distribution, we must consider the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual." However, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents strongly oppose Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In the matter of distribution, they push a whole set of counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods, vigorously advocating reactionary fallacies such as "distribute more, leave less, and sell less." They plot to undermine the socialist collective economy, sabotage the alliance between workers and peasants, and attempt to restore capitalism in the countryside and change the color of our country.

A handful of capitalist roaders within the county and commune party organizations vigorously promote the black goods of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Shandong. In the matter of distribution, they push "work points as the commander," push material incentives, and push counter-revolutionary economism. They falsify and deceive their superiors and conceal the truth from their subordinates, distributing more and selling less. What they do harms the state, harms the collective, and corrupts the thoughts of the commune members. We must settle accounts with them thoroughly! The Chinese Khrushchev wants to lead us astray and make us narrow-minded selfish individuals. This is a futile dream!

Our summer harvest this year is better than any other year. This is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought! This is a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! However, some people think that since the wheat harvest is good, we should distribute more and leave and sell less. This is exactly what the Chinese Khrushchev wants. We must not fall for his tricks and forget the state in times of abundance! Chairman Mao teaches us: "In making plans, doing work, and thinking problems, we must proceed from the fact that our country has a population of 600 million. We must never forget this point." We, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and militiamen, listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. In the matter of distribution, we must have a heart for the country and an eye for the world, understand the overall situation, consider the whole, and carry forward the spirit of collectivism, patriotism, and internationalism. We must sell more surplus grain to the state, support the socialist revolution and socialist construction of our motherland, and support the world revolution!

The wheat is about to be harvested. Someone said that distributing more wheat to the commune members can mobilize the enthusiasm of the commune members. Zhang Shiju, a militia activist and poor peasant, said: "No! We do not rely on material incentives to produce. We must:

Promote proletarian politics.

Our brigade's summer harvest this year is better than any other year. Looking at the golden wheat, it is about to be harvested. Someone said: Distribute more wheat to the commune members, which can mobilize the enthusiasm of the commune members. I said: Using grain to mobilize the enthusiasm of the commune members is actually the poison of the Chinese Khrushchev's "material incentives." We must not fall for this trick.

In the past few years, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents vigorously advocated "material incentives" and pushed "work points as the commander." As a result, the more they stimulated, the worse some people's thoughts became, and the more rampant the "self" became. They picked and chose the easy jobs and did not do the jobs that were not beneficial to themselves, affecting production. The untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists also took the opportunity to sabotage the collective economy. Think about it, if we slide down like this, capitalism will be restored, and we poor and lower-middle peasants will have to pick up our begging sticks again and suffer twice!

Look at this year. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our Songshuzhuang truly changed its mind and changed its clothes. The enthusiasm of the broad masses of militiamen and poor and lower-middle peasants is higher than ever, and their revolutionary spirit is greater than ever. The golden wheat covers the mountains and fields, and the green autumn seedlings grow vigorously. Is this achieved by "material incentives"? Absolutely not! Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin said in the most profound words what is in the hearts of us poor and lower-middle peasants: "Navigating the vast ocean relies on the helmsman, and making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." It is by promoting proletarian politics and relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought that we have fought against heaven and earth and won victory after victory.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." Chairman Mao has pointed out the fundamental direction for us to build a new socialist countryside and develop agricultural production. We poor and lower-middle peasants will definitely unswervingly take the road of promoting proletarian politics. In the summer procurement and distribution work, we will insist on proletarian politics in command. Only in this way can we mobilize the greatest revolutionary and productive enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members.

Someone said that this year's wheat harvest is good, and the work of the cadres is easy. All we need to do is to hand in and distribute. Zhang Chengying, the militia platoon leader, said: "We cannot think so simply. In the matter of distribution, we must:

Grasp the struggle between the two lines.

The summer distribution work is a very important political work, which is always permeated with the struggle between public and private, between the socialist road and the capitalist road. Therefore, in this work, how to handle the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual, we must raise it to the level of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines to recognize and solve it.

Someone said that this year's wheat harvest is good, and the work of the cadres is easy. All we need to do is to hand in and distribute. This kind of simple and one-sided military viewpoint is wrong. If we do this, we will inevitably be defeated in this great struggle between public and private, and the distribution work will go astray. Therefore, we must follow Chairman Mao's great teaching that politics is the commander and the soul, vigorously promote proletarian politics, firmly grasp the struggle between the two lines, combine the situation and tasks of our brigade, deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, use Mao Zedong Thought to break private thoughts and establish public thoughts, use Mao Zedong Thought to command the distribution work, and fundamentally raise the ideological awareness of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and militiamen.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All work must be done through mass movements. Without mass movements, it is impossible." In the matter of grain distribution, there has long been a struggle between the two lines. One is Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and the other is the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev. We must unswervingly implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, believe in the masses, rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and launch mass movements. Only by doing this can we eliminate the revisionist poison spread by the Chinese Khrushchev in the matter of distribution and better complete the distribution and procurement tasks.

Someone said that through revolutionary criticism, the class enemies have been criticized into "dead tigers." Therefore, in the matter of summer harvest distribution, they do not dare to make trouble anymore. Zhang Xuren, the deputy company commander of the militia, said: "No! We must not fall for the Chinese Khrushchev's trick of 'class struggle extinguished.' We must:

Never forget class struggle.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must never forget class struggle," but the Chinese Khrushchev vigorously advocates the theory of "class struggle extinguished," openly opposing our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, and is indeed a great criminal!

Has class struggle really been "extinguished"? Absolutely not! Just think about the reality of class struggle in our brigade, and it is not difficult to see that a handful of class enemies are not willing to die. During the three consecutive years of natural disasters, a handful of untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists thought they had a chance and actively cooperated with the Chinese Khrushchev to spread the evil wind of "three freedoms and one contract" and "four freedoms"; in 1962, when Chiang Kai-shek threatened to invade the mainland, these bad guys jumped out again, stirring up trouble, shouting loudly to "change the sky"; in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, these bad guys jumped up and down, attacking revolutionary cadres, and sabotaging the great alliance and the three-in-one combination of revolution. The living facts of class struggle have deeply educated us that class struggle has not been "extinguished." Recently, someone said: "Through revolutionary criticism, the class enemies have been criticized into 'dead tigers.' In the matter of summer harvest distribution, they do not dare to make trouble anymore." Listen, how complacent! We must not fall for the Chinese Khrushchev's trick of "class struggle extinguished" again! If we become complacent, we will be deceived and suffer great losses, and we will suffer twice!

Vice Chairman Lin instructs us: "Without class standpoint and class struggle standpoint, it is the root of rightist thought and the most fundamental root of rightist opportunism." We, the broad masses of militiamen armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are an important force of the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must never forget class struggle. The more it is the busy season of summer harvest, the more it is the critical moment of summer procurement and distribution, the more we must grasp class struggle, carry out revolutionary criticism thoroughly and deeply, actively lead the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and militiamen, resolutely criticize the revisionist black goods of the Chinese Khrushchev, and resolutely strike at all sabotage activities of the class enemies to ensure the smooth completion of the summer procurement and distribution tasks. We must be like Comrade Deng Hengtong and "guard the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, stand guard, and fight well" in the great struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and create new merits for the people!

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫在分配问题上的修正主义黑货
    ——山东崂山县松树庄大队民兵和贫下中农大批判纪要
    山东省崂山县惜福镇公社松树庄大队的民兵和贫下中农，在人民解放军当地驻军的帮助下，认真分析研究了夏收分配中阶级斗争的新动向，新特点，新问题，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，以“无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部”门合同志为榜样，高举革命的批判大旗，狠狠地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在粮食分配问题上所推行的反革命修正主义黑货，正确处理了夏收分配中的国家、集体和个人三者之间的关系。下面是部分民兵在一次大批判会上的发言。
    有人认为，今年小麦丰收了，可以多分、多吃一点粮食。第一生产队长、民兵排长张世央说：不对！我们要顾大局，识大体，不能光顾个人眼前利益。
    我们必须：胸怀祖国　放眼世界
    毛主席教导我们：“在分配问题上，我们必须兼顾国家利益、集体利益和个人利益。”而中国赫鲁晓夫和他的代理人，却极力反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，在分配问题上推行一整套反革命修正主义黑货，拚命鼓吹“多分少留少交”等反动谬论，阴谋瓦解社会主义集体经济，破坏工农联盟，妄图在农村复辟资本主义，改变我们国家的颜色。
    我们县、社党内一小撮走资派，竭力推行中国赫鲁晓夫及其在山东代理人的黑货，在分配问题上，大搞工分挂帅，大搞物质刺激，大搞反革命经济主义。他们弄虚作假，欺上瞒下，多分少售。他们搞这一套，一害国家，二害集体，三腐蚀社员思想。这笔账我们要和他们彻底清算！中国赫鲁晓夫想把我们引到邪路上去，要我们变成鼠目寸光的利己主义者，这是痴心妄想，白日做梦！
    我们今年夏季的收成比以往任何一年都好，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！可是，有的人却认为小麦丰收了，就要多分少留少交，这不正中了中国赫鲁晓夫的毒吗？我们决不能上他的当，决不能丰收忘了国家！毛主席教导我们：“我们作计划、办事、想问题，都要从我国有六亿人口这一点出发，千万不要忘记这一点。”我们广大贫下中农和民兵最听毛主席的话，在分配问题上，一定要胸怀祖国，放眼世界，要识大局，顾整体，发扬集体主义、爱国主义和国际主义精神，多卖余粮给国家，支援祖国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设，支援世界革命！
    小麦快上场了，有人认为，多分点小麦给社员，可以调动社员的生产积极性。基干民兵、贫农社员张世居说：不对！我们不是靠物质刺激搞生产，我们必须：
    突出无产阶级政治
    我们队今年夏季收成比以往任何一年都好，眼看着一片金黄的小麦，马上就要上场了。有人说：多分点小麦给社员，可以调动社员的积极性。我说：用粮食来调动社员的积极性，实际上就是中国赫鲁晓夫“物质刺激”的流毒，咱可不能上这个当。
    前几年，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人拚命鼓吹“物质刺激”，搞“工分挂帅”。结果，越刺激有的人思想越坏，“私”字越泛滥，干活挑肥拣瘦，不干对自己没有利的活，影响产量。没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子也乘机破坏集体经济。想一想，如果那样滑下去，资本主义就会复辟，咱贫下中农还要拿起要饭棍，再受二茬罪啊！
    再看看今年，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们松树庄真算是人换思想地换装，广大民兵和贫下中农的生产积极性比任何一年都高，革命干劲比任何一年都大，金黄的麦子满山遍野，绿油油的秋苗茁壮生长，难道这是靠“物质刺激”得来的吗？全然不是！我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林副主席用最精辟的语言说出了咱贫下中农的心里话：“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”我们就是靠突出无产阶级政治，靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，战天斗地，夺取了一个又一个胜利的。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”毛主席给我们指明了建设社会主义新农村、发展农业生产的根本方向。我们贫下中农一定坚定不移地走突出无产阶级政治的道路，在夏季征购、分配工作中，坚持无产阶级政治挂帅。这样，才能调动广大社员的最大最大的革命和生产的积极性。
    有人认为，今年小麦收成好，干部的工作很好做，到时候上缴下分就行了。大队民兵指导员张承英说：不能想得这么简单。在分配问题上，我们必须：
    狠抓两条路线斗争这个纲
    夏季分配工作，是一项非常重要的政治工作，它始终贯穿着公与私、走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路的斗争。因此，在这一工作中，如何处理好国家、集体、个人三者关系，必须提到两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的纲上来认识，来解决。
    有人认为今年小麦收成好，干部工作好做，到时候上缴下分就行了。这种就事论事的简单化思想，是单纯军事观点的错误倾向。这样作，势必在这场公与私的大搏斗中打败仗，使分配工作走到邪路上去。因此，我们必须遵照毛主席的政治是统帅，是灵魂的伟大教导，大力突出无产阶级政治，紧紧抓住两条路线斗争这个纲，结合本大队的形势和任务，深入开展革命大批判，用毛泽东思想破私立公，用毛泽东思想统帅分配工作，用毛泽东思想从根本上提高广大贫下中农和民兵的思想觉悟。
    毛主席教导我们：“什么工作都要搞群众运动，没有群众运动是不行的。”在粮食分配问题上，长期以来，就存在着两条路线的斗争。一条是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，一条是中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线。我们一定要坚定不移地执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，相信群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众，大搞群众运动，把政策交给贫下中农。只有这样做，才能肃清中国赫鲁晓夫在分配问题上散布的修正主义流毒，更好地完成分配、征购任务。
    有人认为，通过革命大批判，阶级敌人已被批成了“死老虎”。因此，在夏收分配问题上，他们不敢再捣乱了。大队民兵副连长张绪仁说：不对！咱千万不要上中国赫鲁晓夫“阶级斗争熄灭”论的鬼圈套。我们必须：
    念念不忘阶级斗争
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”，可是中国赫鲁晓夫却拚命鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭”论，公开和我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席唱反调，真是罪该万死！
    阶级斗争真的“熄灭”了吗？绝对不是！想一想我们大队的阶级斗争的现实，就不难看出，一小撮阶级敌人是不甘心于死亡的。在连续三年自然灾害时期，一小撮没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子认为有机可乘，积极配合中国赫鲁晓夫大刮“三自一包”、“四大自由”的妖风；在一九六二年蒋匪介石叫嚣窜犯大陆时，这伙坏家伙又跳了出来，兴风作浪，大吵大嚷要“变天”；在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，这些坏家伙上窜下跳，打击革命干部，破坏革命大联合和革命三结合。活生生的阶级斗争事实深刻地教育了我们，阶级斗争并没有“熄灭”。最近，又有人说：“通过革命大批判，阶级敌人已经被批成‘死老虎’了。在夏收分配问题上，他们不敢再捣乱了。”大家听听，多么麻痹啊！咱可不能再上中国赫鲁晓夫“阶级斗争熄灭”论的鬼圈套！如果咱麻痹起来，咱就要上大当，吃大亏，就要重遭二茬罪。
    林副主席指示我们：“没有阶级观点，没有阶级斗争观点，是右倾思想的根源，是右倾机会主义思想最根本的根源。”咱们用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大民兵，是无产阶级专政的一支重要力量。我们必须念念不忘阶级斗争，越是在夏收大忙季节，越是在夏季征购、分配的关键时刻，我们越要狠抓阶级斗争，持久而深入地开展革命的大批判，积极带领广大贫下中农和民兵，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义黑货，狠狠打击阶级敌人的一切破坏活动，保证夏季征购、分配任务的顺利完成。我们一定要象门合同志那样：“为毛主席的革命路线放好哨，站好岗，打好仗”，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中为人民立新功！
