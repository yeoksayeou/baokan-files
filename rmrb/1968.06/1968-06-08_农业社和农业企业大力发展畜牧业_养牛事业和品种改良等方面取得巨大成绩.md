Agricultural cooperatives and enterprises in Albania are actively developing the livestock industry, rapidly increasing the number of cattle, and achieving great success in cattle breed improvement.

According to a report by the Albanian News Agency, the total number of cattle in Albania has increased by 43 percent compared to 1938. In 1967, milk production accounted for about 60 percent of the total dairy production, whereas in previous years, it was only around 45 percent.

The Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour decided in November 1967 to vigorously develop the breeding of dairy cows nationwide. Since then, extensive measures have been taken in rural areas to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the tasks set by the five-year plan. Various regions have boldly experimented with breed improvement, achieving good results. Some places have established purebred bull stations to improve cattle breeds and increase the reproductive capacity of dairy cows through artificial insemination.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Tirana, Albania's poultry farming industry has developed rapidly in recent years. The total number of poultry is expected to increase by more than 40 percent this year compared to last year. In recent years, Albania has also made significant progress in breeding Beijing ducks. Now, many agricultural enterprises have started large-scale breeding of Beijing ducks.

    养牛事业和品种改良等方面取得巨大成绩
    新华社讯　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道：阿尔巴尼亚的农业生产合作社和农业企业，大力发展畜牧业，使牛的头数迅速增加，并且在改良牛的品种方面作出了巨大成绩。
    目前，阿尔巴尼亚全国的牛的总头数比一九三八年增加百分之四十三。在一九六七年的奶类总产量中，牛奶约占百分之六十，而在前几年，还只占百分之四十五左右。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会一九六七年十一月决定，在全国大力发展饲养母牛。从此，广大农村采取了各种措施，保证完成和超额完成五年计划所规定的任务。各地为了改良牛的品种，大胆试验，取得了良好的效果。有些地方设置了纯种公牛站，以便通过人工受精改良牛的品种和增加母牛的生殖能力。
    据新华社地拉那电　阿尔巴尼亚家禽饲养业近年来获得迅速发展。家禽总数今年预计将比去年增加百分之四十以上。近年来阿尔巴尼亚饲养北京鸭的工作也取得了很大进展。现在，许多农业企业开始大量饲养北京鸭。
