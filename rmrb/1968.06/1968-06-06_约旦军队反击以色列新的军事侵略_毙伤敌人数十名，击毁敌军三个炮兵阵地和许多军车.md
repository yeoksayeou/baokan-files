On the first anniversary of the U.S.-Israeli aggression against Arab countries, the U.S. imperialist tool, Israel, is stirring and has launched new military aggression against Jordan.

According to a broadcast by the Amman radio station, the Israeli aggressor forces at 11:00 AM on June 4th shelled the east bank of the Jordan River with heavy artillery and tank guns. In the afternoon at 3:00 PM, Israeli aircraft indiscriminately bombed villages on the east bank. Subsequently, they concentrated artillery and air strikes on Irbid, a city 90 kilometers north of the Jordanian capital Amman. The Israeli aggressor forces' attack immediately met with fierce resistance from the Jordanian army, and the battle lasted eight hours, ending at 7:00 PM.

A statement from the Jordanian government said that in this battle, four Israeli aircraft were shot down, three Israeli artillery positions in the Besan Valley, four tanks, and six military vehicles were destroyed. The Jordanian army also completely destroyed all enemy positions and vehicles in the Syrian territory of Hima, which Israel had occupied north of Jordan, killing and wounding 45 Israeli aggressor forces.

Reports indicate that Israeli Chief of Staff Bar-Lev inspected the area south of the Sea of Galilee on the evening of the 4th, boasting that this attack on Jordan was a "lesson" for Jordan. Cairo newspapers also reported that Israel has declared its armed forces to be in a "state of emergency."

In recent days, the Israeli aggressor forces have almost daily conducted military provocations against the east bank of the Jordan River. According to reports from Cairo newspapers, the Israeli aggressor forces have amassed approximately 30,000 troops along the west bank of the Jordan River and have moved in a large number of tanks and transport vehicles.

    约旦军队反击以色列新的军事侵略
    毙伤敌人数十名，击毁敌军三个炮兵阵地和许多军车
    据新华社五日讯　在美以侵略阿拉伯国家战争一周年的时候，美帝国主义的侵略工具以色列蠢蠢欲动，连连向约旦发动新的军事侵略行动。
    据安曼电台广播，以色列侵略军六月四日上午十一时，用重炮和坦克炮轰击约旦河东岸，下午三时，以色列飞机又滥炸东岸的村庄，接着又集中炮击和轰炸约旦首都安曼以北九十公里的伊尔比德市。以色列侵略军的攻击，立即遭到约旦军队的激烈抵抗，战斗历时八小时，到下午七时才停止。
    约旦政府发表的公报说，在这场战斗中，共击落以色列飞机四架，击毁以色列侵略军在贝桑河谷的三个炮兵阵地、四辆坦克和六辆军车。约旦军队还摧毁了在约旦以北以色列侵占的叙利亚领土希马的全部敌军阵地和车辆，打死打伤以色列侵略军四十五人。
    据报道，以色列侵略军总参谋长巴列夫在四日晚上视察了加利利海以南地区，叫嚷这次对约旦的进攻是对约旦的一个“教训”。开罗报纸还报道，以色列已宣布它的武装部队处于“紧急状态”。
    最近以来，以色列侵略军几乎每天都向约旦河东岸进行军事挑衅。据开罗报纸报道，以色列侵略军在沿约旦河西岸集结了大约三万军队，并开进了大量坦克和运输车辆。
