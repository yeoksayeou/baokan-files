	American bourgeois newspapers recently reported that out of the 3,100 counties in the United States, 256 are in a state of emergency due to hunger, and more than 1,000 other counties also face hunger problems. In these regions, 10 to 14 million people are starving, mostly African Americans in the southern United States, Mexican Americans in the southwestern region, Native Americans, and white people in the Appalachian Mountains in the eastern United States. American bourgeois newspapers have to admit that there is a "country of the poor" in the United States and advocate that the government provide more "surplus food" for "relief."

	These reports from American newspapers have made the Washington ruling clique very uneasy. The "Agriculture Committee" of the U.S. House of Representatives hurriedly issued a report, pompously declaring, "The Agriculture Committee has not found any cases of hunger in the United States." How straightforward!

	The helpless revelations of American bourgeois newspapers and the hasty "denials" of American legislators vividly reflect the severity of the economic and political crises facing the United States today.

	It is clear that if the plight of the broad masses of the American people had not reached an unprecedentedly dire level, American bourgeois newspapers, which are tasked with whitewashing the truth and maintaining the existing imperialist system, would not have done such a thing as "exposing their own shame."

	It is equally clear that if the class contradictions in the United States were not unprecedentedly sharp, and the anger of the broad masses of the people were not on the verge of exploding, why would the legislators be so panicked and eager to fabricate ridiculous false reports to deny well-known facts and attempt to calm the people?

	In fact, in capitalist society, it is inevitable that the broad masses of the people suffer from poverty and hunger. Stalin once pointed out: "The development path of capitalism is the path of plunging the vast majority of laborers into poverty and a life of semi-starvation." The United States is no exception. The American people are increasingly aware that the wealth of American monopolistic capital is built on the poverty and hunger of the American people. The root cause of the American people's misery is the rule of monopolistic capital, the capitalist system. American bourgeois newspapers think they can ease the people's anger by revealing a bit of the truth and advocating for increased "relief." This is not possible. The legislators in the United States think they can ease the people's anger by covering up the facts and trying to hide the truth. This is even more impossible. Both the American bourgeois newspapers and the American legislators are merely deceiving themselves and others.

    两种手法一个目的晓文
    美国资产阶级报刊最近报道说，美国全国三千一百个县中，有二百五十六个县属于处于危急状态的饥饿地区，还有一千多个县也存在饥饿问题。这些地区中挨饿的有一千万到一千四百万人，大部分是美国南部的黑人、西南部的墨西哥裔美国人、印第安人，以及东部亚帕拉契亚山区的白人。美国资产阶级报刊不得不承认，在美国存在着一个“穷人的国家”，并且主张政府拿出更多“剩余粮食”来进行“救济”。
    美国报刊的这些报道，使华盛顿统治集团非常不安。美国国会众议院的“农业委员会”，赶紧提出了一份报告，冠冕堂皇地宣称，“美国存在饥饿的事例，农业委员会一个也没有找到。”真是说得干脆！
    美国资产阶级报刊的无可奈何的透露和美国议员的迫不及待的“辟谣”，生动地反映出了今天美国所面临的经济和政治危机已到了何等严重的地步。
    很显然，如果不是因为美国广大人民的处境已经发展到了空前恶劣的程度，以粉饰太平、维护现行帝国主义制度为己任的美国资产阶级报刊，是绝不会干出这种“家丑外扬”的事情来的。
    同样明显的是，如果不是因为美国目前的阶级矛盾空前尖锐，广大人民群众的怒火大有一触即发之势，美国的议员老爷们又何致于如此的慌张，急于编造可笑的假报告来否认众所周知的事实，妄图安定人心呢？
    其实，在资本主义社会里，广大人民受穷挨饿是必然的现象。斯大林曾经指出：资本主义的发展道路，就是“使绝大多数劳动者陷于贫困和过半饥半饱的生活的道路”。美国当然也不可能例外。美国人民越来越清楚地认识到，美国垄断资本的财富，是建立在美国人民的贫困和饥饿之上的。美国广大人民的灾难的根源，是垄断资本的统治，是资本主义制度。美国资产阶级报刊想以透露一点事实真相、鼓吹增加“救济”来缓和人民的愤怒，这是办不到的。美国的议员老爷们想以抹煞事实、一手遮天的办法来缓和人民的愤怒，这更是办不到的。美国的资产阶级报刊和美国的议员都同样是自欺欺人罢了。
