The revolutionary committee of the Xiangyang Silk Mill in Hangzhou, with the assistance of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the mill, has led the broad revolutionary workers in carrying out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism. This has greatly raised the class struggle and line struggle consciousness of the broad masses of workers, promoted the revolutionization of people's thinking, and made the revolutionary and production situation of the entire mill increasingly better. Since this year, the mill has overfulfilled its production plan every month, and the quality of its products is also very good.
