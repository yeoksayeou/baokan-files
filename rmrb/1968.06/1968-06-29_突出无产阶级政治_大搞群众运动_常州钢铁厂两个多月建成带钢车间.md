The revolutionary workers of Changzhou Steel Plant in Jiangsu, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the plant, have, through a revolutionary criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of managing enterprises advocated by Liu Shaoqi, firmly established the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao. They have demonstrated the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle. In just over two months, they have completed the construction of the strip steel workshop, which had been delayed for nearly three years by the plant's capitalist roaders, and have quickly put it into production.

Strip steel is used for manufacturing various agricultural machinery and tools. Three years ago, the state decided to expand this plant by adding a strip steel workshop to strengthen socialist construction. However, the plant's capitalist roaders faithfully carried out Liu Shaoqi's revisionist line of managing enterprises, vehemently opposing the policies of emphasizing proletarian politics and self-reliance, and creating numerous obstacles, thus delaying the construction of the strip steel workshop for nearly three years.

Through two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the revolutionary workers throughout the plant have been greatly heightened. They have deeply realized that the enemy class's fierce opposition, resistance, and sabotage of the construction of the strip steel workshop is a manifestation of the intense struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines. Guided by Chairman Mao's teaching of "destroying the old before establishing the new," and with the help of the comrades from the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the plant, they have launched a fierce attack on the enemy class, extensively exposing, criticizing, and struggling against the counter-revolutionary fallacies advocated by Liu Shaoqi and the plant's capitalist roaders, such as "expert management." At the same time, the revolutionary committee of the plant, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "the masses are the real heroes," has emphasized proletarian politics, mobilized the masses, launched mass movements, and adopted the method of combining revolutionary workers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary technical personnel. They have designed and experimented simultaneously, continuously explored, and summarized experiences. After more than two months of arduous struggle, they have finally successfully completed the construction of the strip steel workshop, making a new contribution to the socialist construction of our motherland.

    突出无产阶级政治  大搞群众运动
    常州钢铁厂两个多月建成带钢车间
    新华社南京二十七日电　江苏常州钢铁厂革命职工在驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队帮助下，通过对中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义办企业路线的革命大批判，大立毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神，只用短短两个多月的时间就建成了被厂里走资派压了将近三年的带钢车间，并且迅速投入生产。
    带钢是供制造各种农业机械和农具用的。国家为了加强社会主义建设，三年前就决定这个厂增建带钢车间。但是，厂里的走资派忠实执行中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义办企业路线，拚命反对突出无产阶级政治和自力更生的方针，百般刁难，使带钢车间压了将近三年没有能建成。
    经过两年来无产阶级文化大革命的教育，全厂革命职工的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高。他们深刻地认识到，阶级敌人拚命反对、抵制和破坏带钢车间的建成，是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线激烈斗争的表现。他们遵循毛主席“不破不立”的教导，在驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队同志的帮助下，向阶级敌人发起猛烈进攻，对中国赫鲁晓夫和厂里走资派所鼓吹的“专家治厂”等反革命谬论，进行了大揭发、大批判、大斗争。同时，厂革委会遵循伟大领袖毛主席“群众是真正的英雄”的教导，突出无产阶级政治，放手发动群众，大搞群众运动，采取革命工人、革命干部和革命技术人员三结合的办法，边设计，边试验，不断摸索，不断总结经验，经过两个多月的奋战，终于胜利建成了这个带钢车间，为祖国社会主义建设作出了新的贡献。
