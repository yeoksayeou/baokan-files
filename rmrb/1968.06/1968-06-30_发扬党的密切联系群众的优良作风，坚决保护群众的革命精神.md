Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship." Through the practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past two years, I deeply feel that Chairman Mao's brilliant directive most thoroughly exposes the counter-revolutionary nature of the reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev. It tells us that only by always carrying forward and maintaining the Party's fine tradition of maintaining close ties with the masses and always protecting the revolutionary spirit of the masses can we follow Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, unite millions of revolutionary masses, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Carry Forward the Party's Fine Tradition of Maintaining Close Ties with the Masses and Protect the Revolutionary Spirit of the Masses

Chairman Mao says: "The people, only the people, are the motive force in the creation of world history."

Over the past few decades, under the personal leadership and cultivation of the great leader Chairman Mao, our Party has formed the fine tradition of maintaining close ties with the masses. In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao, with his great courage and wisdom, has mobilized hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses, implemented unprecedented great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and launched the greatest revolutionary mass movement in human history, thus developing our Party's mass line to a new stage.

The Chinese Khrushchev has always fiercely opposed Chairman Mao's brilliant theory and practice of the mass line, extremely hates and suppresses the masses, and attempts to destroy our Party's fine tradition of maintaining close ties with the masses, in order to achieve his evil goal of restoring capitalism. Therefore, on the question of how to treat the masses, our Party has always faced a sharp struggle between two lines. In this irreconcilable struggle, every Communist Party member must decide his political stand and attitude and undergo revolutionary tests. A true Marxist-Leninist must resolutely stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, always believe in and rely on the masses, protect the masses, and protect the revolutionary spirit of the masses.

To do this, we must first seriously study Chairman Mao's theory, line, principles, and policies on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and deepen our understanding of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In the course of this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, at the beginning, I did not understand the unprecedentedly high revolutionary spirit of the broad revolutionary masses, and even felt afraid. As the movement deepened, under the impact of the revolutionary mass movement, I was forced to study Chairman Mao's theory, line, principles, and policies on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat with problems in mind. This gradually made me realize that the representatives of the bourgeoisie within our Party are essentially time bombs hidden among us, the main targets of the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the most dangerous enemies of the proletariat and the working people. In this life-and-death class struggle, to overthrow a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and sweep away all remnants and dregs of the Kuomintang reactionaries, we must rely on the revolutionary mass movement led by Mao Zedong Thought. Revolutionary masses listen to Chairman Mao the most, have the keenest political sense, and have the clearest class stand. They always advance along Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, adhere to the correct direction of the struggle, and direct their spearheads at a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. Their great revolutionary spirit, with the force of a torrential flood and the power of thunder, has thoroughly smashed the bourgeois headquarters headed by the Chinese Khrushchev, unearthed a batch of deeply hidden traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and all counter-revolutionaries; and politically, ideologically, and theoretically, they have thoroughly criticized and exposed them, fully demonstrating the great power of the revolutionary mass movement. The revolutionary mass movement under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought is an irresistible force to expose all class enemies, a violent storm to sweep away all reactionary ideas of the exploiting classes, and a powerful force to liberate the productive forces and promote social development.

Therefore, carrying forward the Party's fine tradition of maintaining close ties with the masses and protecting the masses and the revolutionary spirit of the masses is necessary for continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat to the end and is an important mark to test whether every Party cadre is loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Only by Going Among the Masses to Thoroughly Change One's World Outlook Can One Maintain Close Ties with the Masses and Protect the Revolutionary Spirit of the Masses

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We Communists are not seeking official posts, but are seeking to revolutionize. We must all have a thorough revolutionary spirit, and we must not for a moment be separated from the masses."

Looking back at the war years, when I worked in the army, I thought more about the interests of the motherland and the people and less about personal problems, and my revolutionary will was strong. I could blend with the soldiers and share weal and woe with the people, and we had the same revolutionary aspirations and feelings. Therefore, I could consciously stand on the side of the broad masses of the people, support and carry forward their revolutionary pioneering spirit. However, after the liberation of the whole country, when I entered the city and took off my military uniform, my position became higher and my life more comfortable, and gradually, the airs of an official, arrogance, and pampering grew. I began to think more about reputation and status. As a result, the position of the masses in my eyes became smaller and smaller, and I forgot Chairman Mao's repeated instructions that Communists are not seeking official posts but are seeking to revolutionize. I complacently became an official and a lord. The result was that I seriously alienated myself from the masses and, in the early period of the Cultural Revolution, carried out the reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev, striking at the revolutionary masses and injuring their revolutionary spirit. Later, under the supervision of the revolutionary masses, I reviewed Chairman Mao's instructions, seriously examined my process of going from being close to the masses to alienating from them, from protecting the masses to suppressing them, and deeply realized that being close to the masses and alienating from them is a struggle between two class stands and two world outlooks. The more "self" there is, the less there is of the masses; when "self" expands, one will unconsciously follow the road of suppressing the masses. Therefore, to resolutely stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, to be close to the masses, and to resolutely protect the revolutionary spirit of the masses, one must have a revolution in one's soul and thoroughly change one's world outlook.

The stormy struggle of the masses is the best classroom for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in practice, and it is the best furnace for burning away "self" and tempering "public." Revolutionary masses are the most severe teachers educating us to change our world outlook. Their daring-to-rebel and daring-to-criticize revolutionary spirit is the best medicine and fresh air for changing our world outlook. I once went to some schools, offices, and stores to accept the criticism and education of the revolutionary masses. When I had resistance in my mind, they insisted on principles, criticized my mistakes seriously and patiently; when I realized the seriousness of my mistakes and became discouraged, they pointed out my good points, helped me correctly understand myself, and encouraged me to summon up revolutionary courage; when I showed some real improvement, they encouraged me in time, helped me stand up and take up the heavy burden of revolutionary production again. The more the revolutionary masses criticized and educated me, the more I felt the closeness of the revolutionary masses and the more I cherished their revolutionary spirit. As my world outlook changed step by step, my relationship with the masses became closer and closer. Now, I deeply feel that my past alienation from the masses was disloyalty to Chairman Mao. In the early period of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I carried out the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, suppressed the masses, and committed a crime against the people.

To accept the lesson, strengthen the change of my world outlook, I strictly required myself not to be separated from the masses for a moment. To fight against the airs of an official, I decided not to seek special treatment, and except for necessary duties, I went among the masses to participate in the struggle against selfishness and revisionism and in productive labor. Unless there was an urgent matter, I walked or took public transportation like the masses. Once, I went to Beijing to study. After getting off the train in Beijing at night, I carried more than forty jin of luggage on my back and walked to the place where the Mao Zedong Thought study class was held. The soldiers who organized the study class praised me, and I felt as if I had returned to the war years, fighting side by side with the soldiers, forever being an ordinary soldier.

In the struggle of the masses, constantly changing one's world outlook can enhance the sense of responsibility for the proletarian revolutionary cause, correctly treat the revolutionary mass movement, distinguish the mainstream from the sidestream in the revolutionary mass movement, correctly treat the criticism and help of the masses, and cherish and resolutely protect the revolutionary spirit of the masses. I deeply feel that if one starts from "self," one will always remember one's position, reputation, prestige, and face. In this way, one will be petty-minded about the masses' criticism of oneself, have resentment, and even have antagonistic feelings; if one starts from "public," one will first see the great and fearless revolutionary spirit of the masses in their struggle against capitalist roaders and in their criticism of erroneous leading cadres, which is the most precious and the strong factor to ensure that our country will never change color. Even if the masses' bombardment is wrong for a time or the criticism is too severe, it is only a sidestream of a sidestream, some shortcomings that are inevitably produced in the great mass movement.

The broad revolutionary masses listen to Chairman Mao the most. In the struggle, they can grasp Mao Zedong Thought the fastest, constantly correct their shortcomings, and strike at class enemies more steadily, accurately, and fiercely. They can criticize, educate, and help their own people and revolutionary leading cadres more deeply and warmly. Therefore, we must not only resolutely protect the revolutionary masses who have criticized us in the past but also resolutely protect the revolutionary initiative of the revolutionary masses who dare to criticize us in the future, regardless of whether their criticism is accurate or not, and we must not let class enemies use any pretext to sow discord between the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres. We must let the Party's fine tradition of maintaining close ties with the masses be carried forward better in the new situation, build the revolutionary committees into the strongest fortresses to maintain close ties with the masses and protect the masses, and make every member of the revolutionary committees never separate from the masses and always continue the revolution under the supervision of the masses to the end.

Fight Side by Side with the Masses Against the Class Enemies to Better Protect and Carry Forward the Revolutionary Spirit of the Masses

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, because the broad masses of the people, under the brilliant illumination of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, carried forward the great and fearless revolutionary spirit, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The day the people rejoice is the day the counter-revolutionaries suffer." Class enemies will never reconcile themselves to their failure. The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Jiangsu Province, Jiang Weiqing and Chen Guang, hate and fear the revolutionary spirit aroused by the broad revolutionary masses in the revolutionary movement to death. They always seize on some shortcomings in the mass movement, exaggerate them maliciously, incite bourgeois factionalism, confuse the class lines, attempt to create splits, shift the target of the struggle, and achieve the goal of protecting themselves, suppressing the masses again, strangling the revolutionary spirit of the masses, and sabotaging the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

"Whatever the enemy opposes, we support." Each of us revolutionary cadres must always keep an eye on the new trends of the class enemies, actively fight side by side with the masses against the class enemies, and smash the class enemies' plots of rightist reversal and attempting to suppress the masses again.

Recently, the broad revolutionary masses in the Nanjing area have launched continuous and fierce attacks on the handful of capitalist roaders headed by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Jiangsu Province and Nanjing City, Jiang Weiqing and Chen Guang. In this battle, I analyzed the enemy situation with the masses, studied plans, and arranged the deployment of the battle. On the one hand, I tried my best to learn from the revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary masses, and on the other hand, I dared to criticize and help their shortcomings. I felt that if I did not criticize and help the shortcomings of the revolutionary youngsters, the enemy would have a chance to sneak in, and the revolutionary spirit of the masses would be frustrated and struck. Therefore, I actively talked with some leaders of mass organizations, studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions with them, and used my own mistakes to help them, inspiring them to firmly grasp the correct direction of the struggle, unite as one, and fight the enemy together.

Through the common battle practice with the masses, I deeply feel that carrying forward the Party's fine tradition of maintaining close ties with the masses, going among the masses, and being on the front line of class struggle, both as a commander and a fighter, using Mao Zedong Thought to help the revolutionary masses firmly grasp the correct direction of the struggle, eliminating various interferences, constantly improving the level of the struggle, making the revolutionary masses in their attacks on class enemies take fewer detours and suffer fewer setbacks, fight big battles, and win victories. This is the sacred duty that we revolutionary cadres cannot shirk. Only by doing this can we protect the revolutionary masses to the greatest extent and protect the revolutionary spirit of the masses.

    发扬党的密切联系群众的优良作风，坚决保护群众的革命精神
    南京市革命委员会常委　房震
    毛主席教导我们：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”结合两年来无产阶级文化大革命运动的实践，我深深体会到毛主席这一光辉指示，最透彻地揭露了中国赫鲁晓夫资产阶级反动路线的反革命本质。它告诉我们，只有永远发扬和保持党的密切联系群众的优良作风，永远保护群众的革命精神，才能沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，团结千百万的革命群众，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
      发扬党的密切联系群众的优良作
  风，保护群众的革命精神
    毛主席说：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”
    几十年来，我们党在伟大领袖毛主席的亲自领导和培育下，形成了密切联系群众的优良作风。在这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，毛主席以他伟大的气魄，高度的智慧，放手发动了亿万革命群众，实行了从来没有过的无产阶级专政下的大民主，掀起了人类历史上最伟大的革命群众运动，从而把我党的群众路线发展到一个新的阶段。
    中国赫鲁晓夫一贯地疯狂反对毛主席关于群众路线的光辉理论和实践，极端地仇视和镇压人民群众，企图破坏我党密切联系群众的优良作风，以达到他复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。因此，在怎样对待群众的问题上，我们党从来就存在着两条路线的尖锐斗争。在这个不可调和的斗争中，每一个共产党员都必须决定自己的政治立场和态度，经受革命的考验。一个真正的马克思列宁主义者，他一定坚决地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，永远地相信和依靠群众，保护群众和保护群众的革命精神。
    要做到这一点，首先必须认真学习毛主席在无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，加深对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的理解。在这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，开始我对广大革命群众空前高涨的革命精神很不理解，甚至还感到害怕。随着运动的深入发展，在革命群众运动的冲击下，迫使我带着问题反复学习了毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，使我逐渐认识到，钻进我们党内的资产阶级代表人物，实质上是埋藏在我们身边的定时炸弹，是无产阶级专政下革命的主要对象，是无产阶级和劳动人民最危险的敌人。在这一场你死我活的阶级斗争中，要打倒党内一小撮走资派，扫除一切国民党反动派残渣余孽，要靠毛泽东思想指引下发动起来的革命群众运动。革命群众最听毛主席的话，政治嗅觉最锐敏，阶级立场最鲜明。他们始终沿着毛主席的伟大战略部署前进，坚持斗争的大方向，矛头指向党内一小撮走资派。他们这种大无畏的革命精神，以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，彻底摧毁了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，挖出了一批埋藏很深的叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派和一切反革命分子；并且从政治上、思想上、理论上把他们批倒批臭，充分显示出革命群众运动的巨大威力。在毛泽东思想指引下的革命群众运动是揭露一切阶级敌人的不可抗拒的力量，是扫除一切剥削阶级反动思想意识的暴风骤雨，是解放生产力推动社会发展的强大动力。
    因此，发扬党的密切联系群众的优良作风，保护群众，保护群众的革命精神，是将无产阶级专政下的革命继续进行到底所必需的，是考验每一个党的干部忠不忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的重要标志。
      只有到群众中去彻底改造世界观，
  才能密切联系群众，保护群众的革命精神
    毛主席教导我们说：“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命，我们人人要有彻底的革命精神，我们不要有一时一刻脱离群众。”
    回想在战争年代，自己在军队里工作，想祖国和人民的利益多，想个人的问题少，革命意志就旺盛，就能和战士打成一片，和人民同甘共苦，和人民群众有着共同的革命愿望和思想感情，因此，也就能自觉地站在广大人民群众一边，支持和发扬他们的革命首创精神。但是，当全国解放以后，进了城，脱下了军装，地位高了，生活舒适了，“官”气、“骄”气、“娇”气慢慢滋长了，考虑名誉地位也就多了。这样，人民群众的地位在自己心眼里就越来越小，就忘记了毛主席关于共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命的谆谆教导，心安理得地做“官”当“老爷”了。结果，就严重脱离了群众，以至在文化大革命运动初期执行了中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线，打击了革命群众，伤害了群众的革命精神。后来，在革命群众的督促下，我重温了毛主席的教导，认真检查了自己由联系群众到脱离群众、由保护群众到镇压群众这一过程的沉痛教训，深深认识到联系群众和脱离群众，是两种阶级立场、两种世界观的斗争。“私”字多了，群众观念就少了；“私”字膨胀起来，就会不知不觉走上镇压群众的道路。因此，坚决站在毛主席的革命路线一边，密切地联系群众，坚决保护群众的革命精神，就必须在灵魂深处爆发革命，彻底改造自己的世界观。
    群众斗争的急风暴雨是活学活用毛泽东思想的最好课堂，是烧掉“私”字，炼出“公”字的最好的熔炉。革命群众是教育我们改造世界观的最严厉的老师。他们那种敢于造反、勇于批判的革命精神，正是改造我们世界观的良药和新鲜空气。我曾经到一些学校、机关、商店去接受革命群众的批判和教育。当我思想上有抵触情绪的时候，他们就坚持原则，既严肃又耐心地批判我的错误；当我认识到错误严重，又产生泄气情绪的时候，他们又指出我的优点，帮助我正确认识自己，鼓起革命勇气；当我有一点真正改正错误表现的时候，他们就及时鼓励我，帮助我站起来重新挑起革命生产的重担。这样，革命群众越是批判教育我，我就越是感到革命群众的可亲，越发感到他们的革命精神可爱。随着世界观改造的步步深入，我和群众的关系也越来越密切了。现在，我深深感到过去自己脱离群众是对毛主席的不忠，在无产阶级文化大革命初期，我执行了资产阶级反动路线，压制了群众，这是对人民犯了罪。
    为了接受教训，加强世界观的改造，我就严格地要求自己，一时一刻也不脱离群众。为了狠斗“官”气，我决心不搞特殊化，除了必要的值班外，我尽量到群众中去参加斗私批修和生产劳动。没有紧急事情，就和群众一样步行、坐公共汽车。有一次我到北京学习，到了北京下火车后，已经深夜了，我就背着四十多斤重的行李步行来到毛泽东思想学习班的住地。办学习班的解放军同志表扬了我，我感到就象回到了战争年代，和战士一起行军作战，永远当普通一兵的幸福。
    在群众斗争中不断改造自己的世界观，就能增强无产阶级革命事业的责任心，就能正确地对待革命的群众运动，分清革命群众运动的主流和支流，正确对待群众对自己的批评和帮助，十分珍惜和坚决保护群众的革命精神。我深深体会到，如果从“私”字出发，就会念念不忘自己的地位、名誉、威信、面子。这样对群众批判自己就会斤斤计较，抱有反感，甚至产生对立情绪；如果从“公”字出发，首先就会看到群众斗争走资派和批判有错误的领导干部的大无畏革命精神，是最可贵的，是保证我们国家永不变色的强大因素。即便群众的炮轰一时错了，或者批评过头了，也只是支流的支流，是伟大群众运动中难免产生的一些缺点。
    广大革命群众最听毛主席的话。他们在斗争中能最快地掌握毛泽东思想，会不断地纠正自己的缺点，对阶级敌人会越来越打得稳、准、狠，对自己人、对革命的领导干部能够批评、教育、帮助得更深刻、更热情。所以，我们不但对于过去批评过自己的革命群众要坚决保护，对于今后敢于批评我们的革命群众，不管他批评得准不准，也要坚决地保护他们的革命积极性，决不让阶级敌人利用任何借口来挑拨革命群众和革命干部的关系。我们要让党的密切联系群众的优良作风在新形势下更好地发扬起来，把革命委员会建设成最能联系群众、保护群众的战斗堡垒，使我们革命委员会的每一个成员永远不脱离群众，永远在群众的监督下继续革命到底。
      和群众一起向阶级敌人发起猛烈进
  攻，才能更好地保护和发扬群众的革命精神
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，由于广大人民群众在战无不胜的毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，发扬了大无畏的革命精神，使无产阶级文化大革命取得了决定性的胜利。毛主席教导我们：“人民大众开心之日，就是反革命分子难受之时。”阶级敌人决不会甘心于他们的失败。中国赫鲁晓夫及其在江苏省的代理人江渭清、陈光之流，对广大革命群众及其在革命运动中激发出来的革命精神，恨得要死，怕得要命。他们总是抓住群众运动中的一些缺点，肆意夸大，煽动资产阶级派性，搅乱阶级阵线，企图制造分裂，转移斗争目标，以达到保护自己、重新镇压群众、扼杀群众的革命精神、破坏无产阶级文化大革命的目的。
  “凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护。”我们每一个革命干部必须时刻注视阶级敌人的新动向，主动地和群众肩并肩地向阶级敌人发起猛烈进攻，粉碎阶级敌人搞右倾翻案、企图重新镇压群众的阴谋。
    最近，南京地区的广大革命群众对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在江苏省和南京市的代理人江渭清、陈光一小撮走资派展开了不停顿的猛烈进攻。在这一战斗中，我和群众一块分析敌情，研究方案，安排战斗部署。我一方面努力学习革命群众的革命精神，同时对他们的缺点也能大胆地批评和帮助。我觉得对革命小将的缺点不批评不帮助，敌人就会有空子可钻，群众的革命精神反而会受到挫折和打击，因此我主动地和一些群众组织的负责人谈心，和他们一起学习毛主席的最新指示，并以自己犯错误的教训来帮助他们，启发他们牢牢掌握斗争大方向，团结一致，共同对敌。
    通过和群众共同的战斗实践，我深深体会到，发扬我党密切联系群众的优良作风，到群众中去，亲临阶级斗争第一线，既当指挥员又当战斗员，用毛泽东思想帮助革命群众牢牢掌握斗争大方向，排除种种干扰，不断提高斗争的水平，使革命群众在向阶级敌人的进攻中，少走弯路，少受挫折，打大仗，打胜仗，这是我们革命干部义不容辞的神圣职责。只有做到这一点，才能最大限度地保护革命群众，保护群众的革命精神。
