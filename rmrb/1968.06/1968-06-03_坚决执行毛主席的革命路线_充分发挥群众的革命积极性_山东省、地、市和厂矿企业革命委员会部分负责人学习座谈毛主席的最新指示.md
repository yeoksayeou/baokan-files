Our great leader Chairman Mao has issued his latest directive: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship." The news spread, and the deputy directors of the revolutionary committees of Shandong Province, regions, cities, and factories and mines, who were in Jinan for a meeting, immediately held a study session and discussion.

Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the dividing line between revolution and counter-revolution

Han Jinhai, Wang Zhucuan (Deputy Directors of the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee): Chairman Mao's brilliant and great directive thoroughly exposes the counter-revolutionary essence of all forms of bourgeois dictatorship in the world, thoroughly exposes the counter-revolutionary essence of the reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev, and points out to us the great historical significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in consolidating proletarian dictatorship.

Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people has always been the dividing line between revolution and counter-revolution. All the powers of the exploiting classes are powers to suppress the masses; the revolutionary power of the proletariat is to suppress a handful of class enemies and to protect the broad masses of the people. Under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, whether or not to correctly handle the masses is a major issue of whether to stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line or on the side of the bourgeois reactionary line. Chairman Mao repeatedly teaches us: "We must stand on the side of the masses and never on the side of the enemy. This is a fundamental issue of the standpoint of a Marxist-Leninist." We follow Chairman Mao's teachings, firmly believe in and rely on the broad masses of the people, fully mobilize the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, lead the masses forward, and thus all our work is victorious and the situation gets better and better. On the contrary, where the masses are not correctly handled, the struggle there will encounter twists and turns. We deeply feel that whether or not to correctly handle the masses is a major issue of whether the new revolutionary power can be consolidated and developed, and whether Chairman Mao's revolutionary line can be implemented. This must be solved.

Protecting the broad masses of the people with all one's heart is the key to holding and using power correctly

Mu Lin (Member of the Standing Committee of the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee), Qin Jing (Director of the Changwei Regional Revolutionary Committee): At this crucial moment of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we at all levels of the revolutionary committees must seriously study, deeply understand, and earnestly implement Chairman Mao's latest directive. This has great practical significance for holding and using power correctly.

Power is the power to suppress. The revolutionary committee is a new revolutionary power, and its dictatorship function is to suppress a handful of class enemies. Chairman Mao has long taught us: "Without extensive people's democracy, proletarian dictatorship cannot be consolidated, and the power will be unstable. Without democracy, without mobilizing the masses, without the supervision of the masses, it is impossible to effectively suppress the reactionaries and bad elements, and it is also impossible to effectively reform them. They will continue to make trouble and have the possibility of a comeback." We must exercise the power of proletarian dictatorship and must wholeheartedly protect the people, correctly handle the broad revolutionary masses; if we are detached from the masses and lose the masses, we will lose everything.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, due to the sabotage and disruption of a handful of class enemies, the movement has undergone reversals. During the period when a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party implemented the bourgeois reactionary line, when the class enemies stirred up counter-revolutionary economism and a great wave of reversing cases, some masses were deceived and stood on the wrong side, causing confrontations between the masses and between the masses and the revolutionary committees. However, because the revolutionary committees correctly handled these masses, firmly believed that they loved Chairman Mao and listened to Chairman Mao's words, they wholeheartedly used Mao Zedong Thought to educate them. This greatly raised the class consciousness and line struggle consciousness of the masses, further consolidated and developed the great alliance of revolution and the three-in-one combination of revolution.

Go to the masses and thoroughly transform your worldview

Duan Yi (Deputy Director of the Jinan Municipal Revolutionary Committee, former First Secretary of the Jinan Municipal Committee), Xu Leijian (Member of the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee, former Secretary of the Qingdao Municipal Committee): We linked our past mistakes to study Chairman Mao's latest directive and felt even more that Chairman Mao's directive was extremely intimate. Chairman Mao's latest directive pointed out the fundamental direction for us to achieve ideological revolutionization.

The attitude towards the masses is not just a matter of work style and method, but a fundamental issue of standpoint, a worldview issue. The struggle between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the bourgeois reactionary line is focused on the issue of how to handle the masses. Our great leader Chairman Mao is most concerned about the masses, most trusts the masses, and is heart to heart with the masses. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the creation of world history." "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and ignorant. Not understanding this point, one cannot acquire even the most elementary knowledge." In the past, because we did not study and apply Mao Zedong Thought well, our worldview was not thoroughly transformed, and the issue of our attitude towards the masses was not well resolved. As our positions became higher and our salaries became higher, we went from being detached from the masses and fearing the masses to suppressing the revolutionary mass movement, committing serious errors in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is a necessary result of not thoroughly transforming the bourgeois worldview in our minds.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we followed Chairman Mao's teachings, went deep into the masses, honestly accepted the criticism of the masses, and only then did we have a realization of our errors, beginning to understand that "the most intelligent and capable are those with the most practical experience," while we were indeed childish and ignorant.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution gave us the most profound education on the mass line. In the future, we must study and apply Mao Zedong Thought well, always be the students of the masses, and in the great storms of mass struggle, break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness, thoroughly transform our worldview, and achieve new merits for the people.

Learn from Comrade Men He and be forever loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line

Kong Shijun (Director of the Linyi Regional Revolutionary Committee), Li Fuju (Deputy Director of the Jinan No. 1 Cotton Mill Revolutionary Committee): In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we deeply felt that whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the proletarian revolutionary line and the bourgeois reactionary line. Comrade Men He is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and an important aspect of this is that he always remembers Chairman Mao's great teachings, fully trusts the masses, relies on the masses, and wholeheartedly serves the people, never detaching himself from the masses. He sacrificed his life to protect the masses. We will learn from Comrade Men He, be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, correctly handle the broad masses of the people, and lead the broad masses to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

At present, we are at a crucial moment of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Class struggle is more complex and profound, and a handful of class enemies are doing everything they can to sow discord between the broad masses of the people and the revolutionary committees. We must seriously study Chairman Mao's latest directive, strictly distinguish between the two types of contradictions, wholeheartedly handle the people, protect the people, always believe in and rely on the broad masses of the people, respect the pioneering spirit of the masses, fully mobilize the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, rally the mighty revolutionary army, and concentrate our forces to strike at a handful of class enemies.

### 坚决执行毛主席的革命路线  充分发挥群众的革命积极性  山东省、地、市和厂矿企业革命委员会部分负责人学习座谈毛主席的最新指示

    坚决执行毛主席的革命路线  充分发挥群众的革命积极性
    山东省、地、市和厂矿企业革命委员会部分负责人学习座谈毛主席的最新指示
    本报讯　我们伟大领袖毛主席发出了最新指示：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”消息传来，正在济南开会的山东省省、地、市和厂矿企业革命委员会部分负责同志立即举行了学习座谈。
    对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是革命和反革命的分水岭
    韩金海、王竹泉（山东省革命委员会副主任）：毛主席这一光辉的伟大指示，透彻地揭露了世界上一切形式的资产阶级专政共同的反革命本质，透彻地揭露了中国赫鲁晓夫资产阶级反动路线的反革命本质，向我们指出了无产阶级文化大革命对巩固无产阶级专政的伟大历史意义。
    对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，历来是革命和反革命的分水岭，一切剥削阶级的政权都是镇压人民群众之权；无产阶级的革命政权则是对一小撮阶级敌人实行专政，对广大人民群众实行保护。在无产阶级专政条件下，能否正确对待人民群众，是站在毛主席的革命路线一边，还是站在资产阶级反动路线一边的大是大非问题。毛主席谆谆教导我们：“必须站在人民群众这一边，绝不能站到人民敌人那一边去。这是一个马克思列宁主义者的根本立场问题。”我们遵照毛主席的教导，坚决相信和依靠广大人民群众，充分发挥群众的革命积极性，带领群众前进，因而各项工作就胜利，形势越来越好；反之，那个地方不能正确对待广大人民群众，那里的斗争就要出现曲折。我们深深体会到：能否正确对待群众，是关系到新生的革命政权能不能巩固和发展的大问题，关系到能否贯彻执行毛主席革命路线的大问题，一定要解决好。
    满腔热情地保护广大人民群众是掌好权用好权的关键
    穆林（山东省革命委员会常委）、秦镜（昌潍地区革命委员会主任）：在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，我们各级革命委员会认真学习、深刻领会、切实执行毛主席这一最新指示，对掌好权、用好权有极大的现实意义。
    政权就是镇压之权，革命委员会是新生的革命政权，它的专政职能，就是要镇压一小撮阶级敌人。毛主席早就教导我们：“没有广泛的人民民主，无产阶级专政不能巩固，政权会不稳。没有民主，没有把群众发动起来，没有群众的监督，就不可能对反动分子和坏分子实行有效的专政，也不可能对他们进行有效的改造，他们就会继续捣乱，还有复辟的可能。”我们要行使无产阶级专政的权力，就必须满腔热情地保护人民群众，正确对待广大革命人民群众；脱离了群众，失去了群众，就会丧失一切。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，由于一小撮阶级敌人的破坏和捣乱，运动出现过反复。在党内一小撮走资派推行资产阶级反动路线期间，在阶级敌人煽起反革命经济主义以及大刮翻案妖风的时候，有一部分群众受了蒙蔽，站错了队，造成了群众与群众，群众与革命委员会之间的对立。但是，由于革命委员会正确地对待了这些群众，坚信他们是热爱毛主席，是听毛主席的话的，因而满腔热情地用毛泽东思想教育他们。这就大大提高了群众的阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟，进一步巩固和发展了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。
    到群众斗争中去，彻底改造世界观
    段毅（济南市革命委员会副主任、原济南市委第一书记）、徐雷健（山东省革命委员会委员、原青岛市委书记处书记）：我们联系自己过去犯错误的教训，学习了毛主席这一最新指示，越发感到毛主席指示无比亲切。毛主席这一最新指示，给我们指明了实现思想革命化的根本方向。
    对待群众的态度，决不是一般的作风和工作方法问题，而是根本立场问题，是世界观问题。毛主席的无产阶级革命路线同资产阶级反动路线的斗争焦点，就是如何对待群众的问题。伟大领袖毛主席最关心群众，最相信群众，和群众心连心。毛主席教导我们：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”我们过去由于没有很好地活学活用毛泽东思想，世界观没有得到彻底的改造，对待群众的态度问题，一直没有很好解决。官做大了，薪水高了，从脱离群众、害怕群众，一直发展到压制革命群众运动，在无产阶级文化大革命中，犯了严重错误。这是头脑里资产阶级世界观没有彻底改造的必然结果。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们遵照毛主席的教导，深入到群众中去，老老实实接受群众批评，对自己的错误才有了认识，开始懂得了“最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士”，而自己确实是幼稚可笑的。
    无产阶级文化大革命使我们受到了最深刻的群众路线的教育。今后一定要很好地活学活用毛泽东思想，永远做群众的小学生，在群众斗争的大风大浪中破私立公，彻底改造世界观，为人民立新功。
    以门合同志为榜样永远忠于毛主席的革命路线
    孔世军（临沂地区革命委员会主任）、黎富炬（济南国棉一厂革命委员会副主任）：在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们深深体会到：对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，这是无产阶级革命路线同资产阶级反动路线的根本区别。门合同志无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，很重要的一条就是他能够时刻牢记毛主席的伟大教导，充分地相信群众，依靠群众，全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众。他为了保护群众，不惜牺牲自己的生命。我们决心以门合同志为榜样，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，正确对待广大人民群众，带领广大群众夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    目前，正处在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，阶级斗争更加复杂，更加深刻，一小撮阶级敌人千方百计挑拨广大人民群众同革命委员会的关系，我们必须认真学习毛主席这一最新指示，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，满腔热情地对待人民群众，保护人民群众，永远相信和依靠广大人民群众，尊重群众的首创精神，充分发挥群众的革命积极性，调动起浩浩荡荡的革命大军，集中力量打击一小撮阶级敌人。
