Revolutionary youth, Inner Mongolia's poor and lower-middle peasants welcome you!

Several dozen revolutionary youth from Beijing, following the direction pointed out by our great leader Chairman Mao, have been living and working in our village for over five months. Under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and the care of the poor and lower-middle peasants, they have made rapid progress and shown excellent performance. We, the poor and lower-middle peasants, unanimously praise them as worthy successors of Chairman Mao's Red Guards.

Since the youth came to our village, they have been filled with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, diligently studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and actively propagating Mao Zedong Thought. They have organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes with the poor and lower-middle peasants. Day and night, in the village and in the fields, they study together with us. Now, studying Chairman Mao's works has become a fervent movement in our village, with various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes being held.

The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our village has been excellent. After the youth came down, they actively participated in this great political revolution. They firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, always aiming at a handful of class enemies, and fiercely criticizing and repudiating the revisionist poison spread by China's Khrushchev. In the struggle against the enemy, they all showed great courage. During night patrols and sentry duties as militia, whether male or female, they were serious and diligent, unafraid of hardships. Thus, their class consciousness has been greatly enhanced, and their revolutionary will has been tempered even more firmly.

The youth had not participated in labor before, but after coming down, they fear neither hardship nor fatigue and eagerly take on heavy tasks. During the winter when there is less work, they proactively find tasks to do and do not want to be idle for a single day. Once, while carrying soil, a female comrade, wearing wet shoes in the snow, ran back and forth, and no amount of persuasion could stop her. The villagers were all moved. The work of digging canals in our Hetao region is the heaviest and most tiring. The youth, as soon as they arrived, insisted on going. On the canal construction site, they worked just like the old community members, sweating profusely, with aching backs and legs, but they did not complain of fatigue and persisted to the end. In just a few months, they have learned many farming skills, and their bodies have become much stronger than when they first arrived.

In the past five months, the youth have shown outstanding performance in caring for collective affairs. There was an incident that clearly illustrates this. More than a month ago, one morning, it suddenly started raining. At that time, the villagers had not yet woken up, but there were still farming tools like the plow and harrow in the fields, and grain was piled up on the roofs of the houses, which would be damaged if it rained. Our youth, without being called, saw the rain and, without properly dressing, rushed to the fields, carrying the plow and harrow back, and packing up the grain. Their clothes were all wet, and their bodies were covered in mud, but their spirits were high.

The youth also care deeply about the poor and lower-middle peasants, treating their difficulties as their own. There is a poor peasant who has been ill for many years and lacks labor in his family. After work every day, the youth help him carry water and firewood, and so on.

Since coming down, the youth have been tempered in the three great revolutionary struggles of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, and have made significant progress in transforming their thoughts. Their relationship with the poor and lower-middle peasants has become increasingly close, and the airs of intellectuals are gradually disappearing. People ask them, "Do you miss home?" They say, "The countryside is our home. We will take root here, grow leaves, bloom, and bear fruit." Look, how confident they are!

Their lives here are well-arranged, and each person is much stronger than when they first arrived. All the poor and lower-middle peasants in our village treat them like their own children and are genuinely happy to see their growth. We will definitely help them temper themselves quickly into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

    革命的知识青年，内蒙古贫下中农欢迎你们！
    北京的十几名知识青年，按照伟大领袖毛主席指出的方向，来我们村插队落户已经五个多月了。他们在伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在贫下中农的关怀下，进步很快，表现很好。我们贫下中农一致称赞他们不愧是毛主席的红卫兵。
    知识青年来我们村以后，怀着对毛主席的无限忠诚，坚持活学活用毛主席著作，同时努力宣传毛泽东思想。他们同贫下中农一起大办毛泽东思想学习班。无论白天晚上，在村里、在地头，他们都同我们贫下中农在一起学习。现在，我们村里学习毛主席著作已经形成热潮，办起了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。
    我们村里的无产阶级文化大革命形势一直大好。知识青年下来后，就积极投入这场政治大革命。他们牢牢掌握斗争大方向，矛头始终对准一小撮阶级敌人，狠揭狠批中国赫鲁晓夫散布的反革命修正主义流毒。在对敌斗争中，他们都表现得非常勇敢。在夜间站岗放哨执行民兵任务时，无论男的女的，严肃认真，不怕困难。这样，他们的阶级觉悟有了很大的提高，革命意志磨炼得更坚强了。
    知识青年过去没有参加过劳动，但是他们下来以后，不怕苦，不怕累，抢着干重活。冬天活儿少的时候，就主动找活干，一天也不愿闲着。有次挑土，一个女同学光脚穿双湿球鞋，在雪地里跑来跑去，劝也劝不住，村里人都很感动。我们河套地区修大渠的活儿是最重最累的了，知识青年刚来，就坚决要去。在挖渠工地上，他们和老社员一样干，汗流满面，腰酸腿痛，也不叫累，一直坚持到底。短短的几个月中，他们就学会了不少农活，身体也比来时健壮多了。
    五个多月来，知识青年在爱护集体事业方面的表现也很突出。有一件事很说明问题。一个多月以前的一天清晨，忽然下起雨来。这时，村里人还没睡醒，可是地里还放着农具耧和耙，房上还堆着队里的粮食，雨一淋就会坏。我们的知识青年，不用人叫，一见下了雨，衣服没穿好，就往地里跑，把耧耙扛回，把粮食装起。他们衣服全湿了，浑身是泥，干劲却很足。
    知识青年们还非常关心贫下中农，他们把贫下中农的困难当做自己的困难。有位贫农，常年有病，家里又缺劳力，知识青年每天下工后，就帮他担水，扛柴禾，……
    知识青年下来以后，在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大斗争中认真锻炼，在改造思想方面有很大的收获，和贫下中农的关系愈来愈密切，知识分子的架子正在逐渐消失。人们问他们：“你们想不想家？”他们说，“农村就是我们的家，我们要在这里生根、长叶、开花、结果。”看，他们的信心多足！
    他们在这里的生活，安排得很好，每个人差不多都比刚来时壮实了。我们全村贫下中农把他们当成自己的儿女一样，看到他们的成长，从心眼里高兴。我们一定帮助他们尽快锻炼成为无产阶级革命事业可靠的接班人。
