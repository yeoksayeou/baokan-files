New Delhi, June 14, Xinhua News Agency: The Indian progressive magazine "People's Path" published an article in its June issue, enthusiastically supporting the heroic struggle of French workers and students, and condemning the treacherous actions of the French revisionist leadership in betraying the people.

The article states that the French working class has experience in class struggle. Currently, there is a revolutionary situation in France. The article points out that, however, the obvious betrayal by the French revisionist leadership has deviated from the great pioneering spirit of the students and the working class.

The article further states that French students and revolutionary workers have reached a conclusion: the French revisionists and the unions they control cannot lead them in their struggle.

The article points out: "Revisionist Communist Parties cannot provide political leadership to the working class, nor can they lead the working people to revolution."

The article points out: "Workers must abandon this empty leadership of revisionism and establish revolutionary leaders from their own class to fulfill their historical mission."

The article states that in France, the working class will certainly win in the struggle to establish a revolutionary proletarian regime.

The article concludes: "The Indian working class and the working people of the world will also learn from the French experience that revisionist and reformist Communist Parties that cling to 'economic' struggles are unreliable. Only a fighting revolutionary working-class party can lead the revolution to victory."

In the same issue, the magazine published an article celebrating the surging waves of people's struggles in Western Europe and North America. The article points out: "Currently, in many countries in Western Europe and North America, the student movement is gradually combining with the workers' movement, marking the further awakening of the people, and the further growth of revolutionary forces in these countries. At the same time, this indicates that the broad masses of the people will find the correct path in their struggle."

Lahore, June 14, Xinhua News Agency: The Pakistani magazine "Granite" published an article on June 5, enthusiastically praising the heroic struggle of the French people against the reactionary rule of the monopoly bourgeoisie.

The article states that the Pakistani working people and intellectuals congratulate the resolute struggle of French workers, students, and revolutionary intellectuals. The blow dealt by French workers, students, and revolutionary intellectuals to the decaying capitalist system has inspired workers, students, and revolutionary intellectuals around the world. This struggle has received the support of the people in various countries in Europe and North America.

The article points out that the heroic struggle of French workers will have a great impact on Europe, America, and even the whole world. This struggle will certainly also have an impact on the countries of Eastern Europe. This struggle is a significant blow to imperialism and its reactionary lackeys.

The article states that French workers have shown their unity in the struggle, demonstrating their ideological awakening. This struggle clearly shows that social democrats and revisionists are incapable of leading the proletarian struggle. These two types of people have been fully exposed in the twelve days of struggle.

The article concludes: "It can be said that in France, the failure of capitalism and the victory of the working people will greatly accelerate the process of the final collapse of world imperialism. The working people of the world, the people of various colonial countries, and the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are very pleased with the victory of French workers."

Paris students, full of fighting spirit, march proudly and vigorously in the streets.

    新华社十四日讯　新德里消息：印度进步刊物《人民之路》月刊六月号发表文章，热烈支持法国工人和学生的英勇斗争，并且谴责法国修正主义领导集团背叛人民的可耻行径。
    文章说，法国的工人阶级有着阶级斗争的经验。目前在法国有着革命的形势。文章指出，但是，法国修正主义领导集团的明显的叛卖背离了学生和工人阶级的伟大的首创精神。
    文章又说，法国学生和革命工人得出了一个结论：法修及其控制的工会不可能领导他们进行斗争。
    文章指出：“修正主义的共产党不可能给予工人阶级以政治领导，它们也不可能领导劳动人民走向革命。”
    文章指出：“工人们必须抛弃这种修正主义的空虚的领导，从他们自己的阶级中确立革命的领导人，以便完成他们的历史任务。”
    文章说，在法国，工人阶级在建立革命的无产阶级政权的斗争中一定会赢得胜利。
    文章最后说：“印度工人阶级和全世界的劳动人民也将从法国的经验中认识到：死抱住‘经济’斗争的修正主义的和改良主义的共产党是靠不住的。只有战斗的革命的工人阶级政党才能领导革命获得胜利。”
    这家月刊在同一期发表文章，欢呼西欧、北美人民斗争的汹涌浪潮。文章指出：“目前在西欧、北美许多国家中，学生运动同工人运动逐步结合，标志着人民的进一步觉醒，标志着在这些国家的革命力量的进一步成长。同时，这表明广大人民群众在他们的斗争过程中，必将找到一条正确的道路。”
    新华社拉瓦尔品第十四日电　巴基斯坦《顽石》周刊六月五日发表文章，热情赞扬法国人民反对垄断资产阶级反动统治的英勇斗争。
    文章说，巴基斯坦劳动人民和知识分子，对法国工人、学生和革命知识分子的坚决斗争表示祝贺。法国工人、学生和革命知识分子对腐朽的资本主义制度的打击，鼓舞了全世界的工人、学生和革命知识分子。这一斗争得到欧洲和北美各国人民的支持。
    文章指出，法国工人的英勇斗争将对欧洲、美洲以至全世界产生巨大的影响。这一斗争也肯定会对东欧国家产生影响。这场斗争，是对帝国主义及其反动走狗的一次有重大意义的打击。
    文章说，法国工人在斗争中显示了他们的团结，说明了他们的思想觉悟。这场斗争清楚表明，社会民主党人和修正主义者没有能力领导无产阶级的斗争。这两种人在十二天的斗争中已经暴露无遗。
    文章最后说，可以肯定，在法国，资本主义的失败和劳动人民的胜利将会大大加快最后使世界帝国主义彻底垮台的进程。全世界的劳动人民、各殖民地国家的人民和亚非拉美的人民对法国工人的胜利感到十分欢欣鼓舞。（附图片）
