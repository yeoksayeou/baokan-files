Respected Chairman Mao, we will forever be loyal to your revolutionary line!
— Warmly celebrating the great leader Chairman Mao's reception of our military personnel in Beijing attending the Mao Zedong Thought Cadres Training Class

The surging tide of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is sweeping away all obstacles, surging forward with irresistible momentum.

The broad masses of soldiers and civilians across the country have responded enthusiastically to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao, launching a wave of learning from comrades who are steadfastly loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

In this inspiring atmosphere of great unity, the comrades from the Nanjing and Shenyang regions of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, as well as those from the various headquarters, military branches, and services attending the Mao Zedong Thought Cadres Training Class, came to the side of the red sun, bringing with them the boundless love, admiration, faith, and loyalty of the broad masses of cadres and soldiers to Chairman Mao. They waited eagerly for the reception by the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao.

In the magnificent Great Hall of the People, songs praising the great leader Chairman Mao resounded like the waves of the sea, one after another. Revolutionary fighters who had established new merits for the Party and the people in the long years of struggle and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution could not contain their excitement and sang in unison:

"The ship sails on the sea guided by the helmsman,
Revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought..."

"The sky is vast, the earth is vast, but the Party's grace is the greatest,
Parents are dear, but Chairman Mao is dearer..."

On the evening of June 3, 1968, the most unforgettable and happiest moment of our lives arrived!

The East is red, the sun is rising. Our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, with a radiant face and vigorous spirit, walked onto the stage with steady steps, accompanied by his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin and other central leaders. Instantly, the hall became a sea of joy. Millions of red hearts turned towards the red sun, and millions of smiling faces welcomed the red sun. Everyone held up red copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted a thousand times, ten thousand times, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" Chairman Mao walked to the front of the stage, waving warmly to the audience and applauding enthusiastically. Seeing Chairman Mao in such good health and full of energy, everyone felt immense happiness and warmth, and with boundless enthusiasm, they wished Chairman Mao a long, long life! Long, long life! Long, long life!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! In the midst of the victory songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, you personally received us, which is the greatest care, encouragement, education, and motivation for the soldiers and civilians across the country. This is a brilliant new chapter in the history of our army's building, a great driving force for us to complete the tasks of "three supports, two militaries," war preparedness, and various other tasks. It has extremely profound significance for the construction of our army to be highly proletarian and highly combat-ready.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Your revolutionary line is our lifeline. We are consciously and thoroughly loyal to your revolutionary line.

Most respected Chairman Mao! The People's Liberation Army, which you personally founded and led, is most loyal to you, to your brilliant thoughts, and to your proletarian revolutionary line. The loyalty of comrades like Tan Zhenlin is our outstanding representative and shining example. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in the fierce struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, we have fearlessly climbed mountains of knives and leaped into seas of fire to defend your revolutionary line.

The party committee of a certain unit of the support-left troops stationed in Huainan was honored to be received by the great leader Chairman Mao. They brought the most beautiful wishes of the broad masses of cadres and soldiers: wishing the great leader Chairman Mao a long, long life! Long, long life! Over the past year, this unit's party committee has led the troops to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, established Mao Zedong Thought training classes, and firmly implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. They have remembered Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," taken the initiative in class struggle, and together with the workers and the broad masses of the people in Huainan, carried out a thorough criticism and repudiation of the enemy, launching a fierce attack on the class enemy. In organizing the masses to fight against the enemy, the party committee has followed Chairman Mao's great teachings, strictly distinguished between the two types of contradictions, united the majority of the masses and cadres, and thoroughly isolated and struck at a handful of stubborn class enemies, making the revolution vigorous and production flourishing. Party committee member and deputy commander Ren Buqu said after the reception: "Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the most thorough mass line. As long as we follow Chairman Mao's teachings, protect the masses, believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, we will be invincible."

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Over the decades, we have followed your proletarian military line, from nothing to something, from small to large, from weak to strong, building an unparalleled people's army. In the Cultural Revolution, we have severely criticized the capitalist military line advocated by China's Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan, making the revolutionary construction of the troops enter a new stage.

The responsible cadres of the unit where the "Model Red Ninth Company for Studying Chairman Mao's Works" is located, today happily saw the great commander Chairman Mao again. He was moved to tears and particularly excited. In 1950, Wang Yaorong attended the National Conference of War Heroes and saw the great leader Chairman Mao for the first time, personally listening to Chairman Mao's warm instructions. At this conference, he received a copy of the "Resolutions of the Gutian Conference" personally formulated by Chairman Mao. Over the past eighteen years, he has carried this red treasure book wherever he went. This treasure book has been his guide to action and his direction for progress. When the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan fiercely opposed Chairman Mao's military line, Wang Yaorong read the "Resolutions of the Gutian Conference" over and over again and resolutely resisted Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan's plot to seize the military and oppose the Party. Last March, he rushed to the forefront of supporting agriculture, still carrying this treasure book with him. He remembered Chairman Mao's teaching that "the Chinese Red Army is a armed group executing revolutionary political tasks," actively using Mao Zedong Thought to propagate, organize, and arm the masses, helping the revolutionary masses to achieve great unity and establish revolutionary committees. He said, "I will unswervingly follow the path of the Gutian Conference resolutions and let the spirit of the Gutian Conference shine forever."

"Standing on the island looking towards Beijing, the heart is surging with hot blood, the soldier's heart turns towards Chairman Mao, building a Great Wall along the ten thousand li of the sea." Zhang Ming, an active learner and user of Mao Zedong Thought from the Nanjing Army, a war hero, and a responsible person of a certain garrison unit, brought the loyal hearts of the coastal defenders. Today is the tenth time he has been received by Chairman Mao, and his heart is surging, his blood is boiling, and he has so much to say to Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! It is your great thought that has made us clear-sighted and resolute in resisting the capitalist military line advocated by China's Khrushchev and Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan in coastal defense construction. We have realized military-civilian joint defense with our hearts loyal to you, turning our great motherland's ten thousand li of coast into an iron wall. In the future, we will be like Comrade Tan Zhenlin, guarding your revolutionary line, defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and national security for life.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You taught us: "Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor. The decisive factor is people, not things." People armed with your brilliant thoughts are the greatest combat power, invincible in the world. Zhang Enhua, deputy squadron leader of a certain air force unit, saw the great commander Chairman Mao and was extremely moved, shouting over and over again: Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao! Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the cadres and soldiers of Zhang Enhua's unit, with boundless loyalty to the great commander Chairman Mao, have ridden the east wind straight into the clouds, successively shooting down five invading American imperialist spy planes, safeguarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and national security, and establishing new merits for the people. This unit was established not long ago and has already engaged in a struggle with American air pirates. Relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, they soared through the skies, making the American air pirates panic-stricken, and successively shooting down and damaging fifty-six enemy planes. The great leader Chairman Mao personally inscribed a message for them. Over the past decade, Chairman Mao's warm care has greatly educated, inspired, motivated, and encouraged the broad masses of cadres and soldiers in this unit. In the fierce struggle between the two military thoughts and two military lines, they have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works, and their awareness of the two-line struggle has been raised higher, and their thoughts have become redder. They have made a steel oath: to live for the struggle of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and to die for the defense of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Your revolutionary line is our lifeline. We will forever follow your revolutionary line, breaking waves and forging ahead.

Most respected Chairman Mao! You recently pointed out wisely: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship."

As soon as this latest instruction was issued, the comrades in Beijing attending the Mao Zedong Thought Cadres Training Class immediately conducted serious study and heated discussions. Comrades from the forefront of "three supports, two militaries" deeply felt: Your revolutionary line is the line to protect the broad masses of the people. Correctly treating the broad masses of the people and firmly protecting the broad masses of the people is the core of your revolutionary line. Xu Long, a responsible person of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of a certain unit of the Shenyang Army stationed at the Anshan Dashiqiao Magnesium Mine, an advanced collective of active learners and users of Mao Zedong Thought, said with boundless admiration: "At every critical moment of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it is always you who timely issue the latest instructions, guiding us from victory to victory. In our support-left work, we have followed your great teaching of 'believing in and relying on the masses,' firmly believing in the majority of the masses, uniting with the majority of the masses, relying on the majority of the masses, supporting the majority of the masses, and together with the revolutionary cadres and workers, we have smashed the dream of China's Khrushchev and his agents to restore capitalism. We will definitely follow your latest instructions, in the struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, protect the broad masses of the people, correctly treat the masses, forever be the students of the masses, and forever advance along your revolutionary line to victory!"

Most respected Chairman Mao! The People's Liberation Army, which you personally founded and led, has been tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the awareness of the two-line struggle has been unprecedentedly heightened. We will firmly remember your teaching of "carrying the revolution through to the end," taking "criticizing selfishness and repudiating revisionism" as the key link, further promoting the thought revolutionization, and forever advancing along your revolutionary line.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Your proletarian military line is the lifeline of our army. We will resolutely implement your military line and resolutely implement the series of policies and principles of your close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin on actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing proletarian politics, insisting on the four firsts, carrying forward the three-eight style, promoting the three great democracies, and creating the four good classes, in the struggle between the two lines, turning the troops into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

Liu Renfu, an active learner and user of Mao Zedong Thought from the Nanjing Army, former political instructor of the "Good Eighth Company on Nanjing Road," and political commissar of a certain regiment, was extremely moved to see you. He said: When we, the Eighth Company, brought the gunpowder of the battlefield into the most prosperous Nanjing Road in Shanghai, we followed your teaching of "always maintaining the style of modesty, prudence, no arrogance, and no impatience, and always maintaining the style of hard work and plain living." We repelled the attacks of the bourgeois sugar-coated bullets, remained pure in the midst of the bustle, and maintained the glorious tradition of hard work and plain living of our Party and army. In the fierce struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, we have always unswervingly followed the path of emphasizing proletarian politics, resisted the capitalist military line advocated by China's Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan, and defended your proletarian military line. In the future, we will definitely be vigilant against arrogance and impatience and forever advance along your military line.

The members of a certain regiment's party committee seriously studied your teachings on emphasizing political military building before the reception. This party committee insists on actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, grasping its own thought revolutionization, and has become an advanced collective of active learners and users of Mao Zedong Thought in the Shenyang Army. They said: "Studying the highest instructions by your side is the most intimate. We will definitely take 'criticizing selfishness and repudiating revisionism' as the key link, further promote the thought revolutionization of the party committee, build the party committee into a leadership collective that is infinitely loyal to you, and turn the troops into a red Mao Zedong Thought school."

After the great commander Chairman Mao's reception, the comrades' excited mood could not calm down for a long time. Whether they were young cadres or veteran Red Army soldiers in their fifties, they all enthusiastically cheered and sang loudly. They immediately spread the great news of Chairman Mao's reception to the coastal defense front, the forefront of "three supports, two militaries," and various battle positions. Wherever the news reached, there was a surge of joy, and the slogan "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" shook the earth and echoed through the clouds. The comrades who were received immediately held a mobilization meeting at night, pledging loyalty to Chairman Mao and expressing their determination. At the mobilization meeting, the heroes of the 1124 construction site, the "Linfeng Brigade," the good soldiers of Chairman Mao Lei Feng, Liu Yingjun, Cai Yongxiang, and the former units of the heroes Dong Jianrui, Yang Gensheng, Huang Shuohe, Wang Lihe, and the comrades who were received all took oaths: The sea may dry up, the stones may crumble, but our red hearts loyal to Chairman Mao will never change! The earth may shake, the mountains may sway, but our determination to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line will never waver!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! We will definitely turn your reception into a great force and, taking Vice Chairman Lin as a shining example, forever be loyal to you, forever loyal to your brilliant thoughts, and forever loyal to your revolutionary line. Like Comrade Tan Zhenlin, we will "always think of Chairman Mao, always follow Chairman Mao, always be with Chairman Mao, and always be for Chairman Mao," taking the study, implementation, propaganda, and defense of your revolutionary line as our lifelong battle mission. We will carry out the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in human history to the end and carry out the Chinese revolution and the world revolution to the end!

    东方红，太阳升。我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席，满面红光，神采奕奕，迈着稳健的步伐，和他的亲密战友林副主席以及中央其他领导同志登上主席台。顿时，大厅里形成了欢腾的海洋，千万颗红心向着红太阳，千万张笑脸迎着红太阳，大家高举红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，千遍万遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”毛主席走向主席台前沿，十分高兴地向全场同志亲切招手，热烈鼓掌。大家看到毛主席身体非常非常健康，精力非常非常充沛，心里感到无比幸福，无比温暖，满怀激情地千遍万遍祝愿毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，您亲自接见我们，这是对全国军民最大的关怀，最大的鼓舞，最大的教育，最大的鞭策。这是我军建军史上光辉的新篇章，是我们完成“三支”“两军”任务、战备任务和各项工作任务的巨大动力，对我军非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的建设有着极其深远的意义。
      毛主席啊，毛主席！您的革命路线是我们的生命线，我们对您的革命路线自觉地忠，彻底地忠
    最敬爱的毛主席啊！您亲自缔造和领导的人民解放军，对您老人家，对您的光辉思想，对您的无产阶级革命路线，最忠最忠。万曲颂歌唱不尽革命战士对您的无限热爱，万支红笔写不完革命战士对您的无限信仰，万顷波涛倾吐不尽革命战士对您的无限崇拜，万里长空容纳不下革命战士对您的无限忠诚。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！在京参加毛泽东思想学习班的干部听到您老人家要接见的喜讯后，心潮似海，激情如火。沈阳部队活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子、战斗英雄王工一，兴奋得几天几夜不能入睡。他把革命群众送给他的毛主席像章，精心地制成“毛主席万岁”五个金光闪闪的大字。王工一怀着对毛主席的一片忠心，在部队，工厂，农村，机关，学校，到处颂扬伟大导师毛主席领导中国革命的丰功伟绩，颂扬战无不胜的毛泽东思想，颂扬毛主席的革命路线。一年来，他作了颂扬报告一百五十多场次，听众近十万人。今天，在伟大领袖毛主席接见后，王工一激动地说：“一个人的生命是有限的，而颂扬伟大领袖毛主席，传播毛泽东思想，则是千秋万代的大事。我要把有限的生命献给这千秋万代的大事。”
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您的无产阶级革命路线，是我们的命根子，您的革命路线指引我们从胜利走向胜利。我们对您的革命路线自觉地忠，彻底地忠。
    在革命战争中屡建战功的南京部队某部“济南第一团”的领导成员，带着全团指战员对毛主席的无限忠心，见到了伟大领袖毛主席。他们热烈地欢呼，纵情地歌唱。这个团的党委在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，带领部队在“三支”“两军”第一线，坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线上，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决支持左派广大群众。在和阶级敌人的激烈搏斗中，狂风恶浪不动摇，粉身碎骨志不移，又为人民立下新功。在受到伟大领袖毛主席接见后，他们无比激动，代表部队指战员宣誓：我们要在阶级斗争的大风浪中，进一步锤炼对毛主席革命路线的忠心，做到为毛主席的革命路线放好哨，站好岗，打好仗。
    海军“长江舰”前政委刘松，今天见到了伟大领袖毛主席。他以无比激动的心情谈起海军战士对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱和忠诚。十五年前，伟大领袖毛主席登上“长江舰”，走遍了每个舱室和战位，看望干部战士，并亲笔题词：“为了反对帝国主义的侵略，我们一定要建立强大的海军。”为海军建设制订了一条马克思列宁主义的总方针。毛主席的英明教导，毛主席的伟大革命实践，深深刻印在海军干部战士的心坎上，永远鼓舞着海军干部战士乘风破浪向前进。可是，中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿却疯狂反对毛主席的建军路线，顽固推行资产阶级军事路线。用毛泽东思想武装起来的海军战士，坚决抵制了资产阶级军事路线，勇敢捍卫了毛主席的建军路线。在无产阶级文化大革命中，“长江舰”的指战员开展了轰轰烈烈的革命大批判，大破资产阶级军事路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级建军路线。革命战士们说：葵花朵朵向阳开，百川奔腾归大海；战士忠于毛主席，海枯石烂志不移。
    最敬爱的毛主席啊！跟随您南征北战几十年的许多老战士，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的时刻，见到了您，心潮滔滔逐浪高，热血沸腾喜泪流。毛主席啊，毛主席！是您在井冈山点燃了星星之火；是您率领我们胜利地完成了举世闻名的二万五千里长征；是您在永垂史册的遵义会议上，结束了“左”右倾机会主义路线在党内的统治，奠定了中国革命的胜利基础；是您在革命圣地延安指挥我们打败了日本帝国主义；是您统帅我们推翻了蒋家王朝，在天安门广场上升起了第一面五星红旗。今天，您又领导着我们进行史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，把无产阶级专政下的革命进行到底。毛主席啊，毛主席！几十年来，我们的一切胜利，都是您光辉思想的伟大胜利，都是您革命路线的伟大胜利。我们的经验体会有千万条，最根本的一条，就是您的革命路线是唯一正确的路线，是胜利的路线，是我们的生命线，捍卫您的革命路线是我们最神圣的职责。在井冈山上，您亲自教过学政治、学文化的龙开富，在陕北直罗镇战斗中负了伤被您亲手扶上担架的游好扬，以及周纯麟、官峻亭、邱仁华等许多老红军战士被接见后，激动得彻夜不眠，和大家一起向您表决心，献忠心。他们说：敬爱的毛主席，我们一定要以林副主席为光辉榜样，更高地举起您光辉思想的伟大红旗，自觉地、彻底地忠于您，忠于您的光辉思想，忠于您的革命路线。我们一定要牢记您“全心全意地为人民服务”的教导，“做无产阶级和人民大众的‘牛’，鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已。”我们一定要把您的光辉思想世世代代传下去，誓叫天红地红，代代红。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您的革命路线是我们的生命线，我们生为您的革命路线战斗，死为您的革命路线献身
    最敬爱的毛主席啊！您亲自缔造和领导的人民解放军，无限忠于您的革命路线。门合同志就是我们杰出的代表和光辉的榜样。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大搏斗中，我们为了捍卫您的革命路线，刀山敢上，火海敢闯。
    驻淮南支左部队某部党委的同志，光荣地受到了伟大领袖毛主席的接见。他们带来了广大指战员最美好的心愿：敬祝伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！一年来，这个部队党委带领部队紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，大办毛泽东思想学习班，坚决落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，掌握阶级斗争的主动权，同淮南的工人阶级和广大人民群众一起，深入展开革命大批判，向阶级敌人展开了猛烈的进攻。党委在组织群众对敌斗争中，遵照毛主席的伟大教导，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，团结大多数群众和干部，彻底孤立和打击了一小撮顽固的阶级敌人，使革命朝气蓬勃，生产蒸蒸日上。党委成员、副部队长任保俗在接见后说：“毛主席的革命路线是最彻底的群众路线，只要我们遵照毛主席的教导，保护群众，相信群众，依靠群众，充分发挥群众的积极性，就无往而不胜。”
    毛主席啊，毛主席！几十年来，我们沿着您的无产阶级建军路线，从无到有，从小到大，从弱到强，建成了一支举世无双的人民军队。在文化大革命中，我们又狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿所推行的资产阶级军事路线，使部队革命化建设进入了一个新的阶段。
    “学习毛主席著作的模范红九连”所在部队的负责干部、战斗英雄王耀荣，今天又幸福地见到了伟大统帅毛主席，他热泪盈眶，格外激动。一九五○年，王耀荣出席了全国战斗英雄代表会议，第一次见到伟大领袖毛主席，亲自聆听了毛主席的亲切教导。在这次会议上，他领到一本毛主席亲自制定的古田会议决议。十八年来，他走到那里，就把这本红色宝书带到那里。这本宝书，成为他行动的指南，前进的方向。在反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿疯狂反对毛主席的建军路线时，王耀荣一遍又一遍地读了古田会议决议，对彭德怀、罗瑞卿的篡军反党阴谋进行了坚决的抵制。去年三月，他奔向支农第一线，仍把这本宝书带在身旁。他牢记毛主席“中国的红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团”的教导，积极地用毛泽东思想宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众，帮助革命群众实现了革命大联合，建立了革命委员会。他说：“我要坚定不移地沿着古田会议决议的道路走下去，让古田会议的精神永放光芒。”
    “站在海岛望北京，心中热血如潮涌，战士心向毛主席，万里海疆铸长城。”来自海防前线的南京部队活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子、战斗英雄、某守备部队负责人张明，带来了海防战士忠于毛主席的颗颗红心。今天是他第十次受到了毛主席的接见，他心潮澎湃，热血沸腾，有多少话要对毛主席讲啊！毛主席啊，毛主席！是您的伟大思想使我们心明眼亮，坚决抵制了中国赫鲁晓夫和彭德怀、罗瑞卿在海防建设上推行的资产阶级军事路线，我们用无限忠于您的颗颗红心，实现了军民联防，把我们伟大祖国的万里海疆，筑成一道铜墙铁壁。今后，我们要象门合同志那样，为捍卫您的革命路线，保卫无产阶级文化大革命和祖国安全，放一辈子哨，站一辈子岗。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您教导我们：“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。”用您的光辉思想武装起来的人，就是最大的战斗力，就无敌于天下。空军某部副大队长张恩华见到了伟大统帅毛主席，万分激动，一遍又一遍地高呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！无产阶级文化大革命以来，张恩华所在部队的指战员，怀着对伟大统帅毛主席的无限忠诚，乘东风直上云霄，先后击落入侵我国领空的美帝国主义强盗飞机五架，保卫了无产阶级文化大革命，保卫了祖国的安全，为人民立了新功。这支部队刚刚建立不久，就与美帝国主义的空中强盗进行了较量，他们靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，驰骋长空，打得美国空中强盗焦头烂额，先后击落击伤敌机五十六架，伟大领袖毛主席亲笔为他们题了词。十几年来，毛主席的亲切关怀，极大地教育、鼓舞、鞭策和激励着这个部队的广大指战员。在两种建军思想、两条建军路线的激烈斗争中，他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，两条路线斗争的觉悟提得更高了，思想更红了。他们立下钢铁誓言：生为毛主席革命路线战斗，死为毛主席革命路线献身。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您的革命路线是我们的生命线，我们永远沿着您的革命路线，乘风破浪，奋勇向前
    最敬爱的毛主席啊！您老人家最近英明地指出：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”
    您的这一最新指示一发表，在京参加毛泽东思想学习班的同志，立即进行了认真的学习和热烈的讨论。从“三支”“两军”第一线来的同志们深深体会到：您的革命路线是保护广大人民群众的路线。正确地对待广大人民群众，坚定地保护广大人民群众，是您的革命路线的核心。沈阳部队活学活用毛泽东思想先进集体、某部驻鞍钢大石桥镁矿毛泽东思想宣传队负责人徐龙，以无比敬仰的心情说：“在无产阶级文化大革命的每一个关键时刻，总是您老人家及时发出最新指示，为我们指明方向，引导我们从胜利走向胜利。我们在支左中，遵照您‘要相信和依靠群众’的伟大教导，坚定地相信群众的大多数，团结群众的大多数，依靠群众的大多数，支持群众的大多数，和广大革命职工一起粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人妄图复辟资本主义的迷梦。我们一定遵照您的最新指示，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的斗争中，保护广大人民群众，正确对待群众，永做群众的小学生，永远沿着您的革命路线乘胜前进！”
    最敬爱的毛主席啊！您亲自缔造和领导的人民解放军，经过无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼，两条路线斗争的觉悟空前提高。我们决心牢记您“将革命进行到底”的教导，以“斗私，批修”为纲，进一步搞好思想革命化，永远沿着您的革命路线奋勇向前。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您的无产阶级建军路线，是我军的生命线，我们要坚决贯彻执行您的建军路线，坚决贯彻执行您的亲密战友林副主席关于活学活用毛主席著作、突出无产阶级政治、坚持四个第一、大兴三八作风、发扬三大民主、创造四好连队等一系列着重政治建军的方针原则，在两条路线斗争中，把部队办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    南京部队活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子、“南京路上好八连”前任政治指导员、某团政治委员刘仁福见到您老人家，心情万分激动。他说：当年，我们八连带着战场上的硝烟进驻上海最繁华的南京路的时候，就遵照您老人家“务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风”的教导，打退了资产阶级糖衣炮弹的进攻，做到了身居闹市，一尘不染，保持了我党我军艰苦奋斗的光荣传统。在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中，我们始终坚定不移地走突出无产阶级政治的道路，抵制了中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿推行的资产阶级军事路线，捍卫了您老人家的无产阶级建军路线。今后我们一定要戒骄戒躁，永远沿着您的建军路线前进。
    某师党委的成员，在您接见前夕，认真学习了您关于着重政治建军的教导。这个党委，坚持活学活用毛泽东思想，狠抓自身思想革命化，成为沈阳部队活学活用毛泽东思想先进集体。他们说：“在您老人家身边学习最高指示，最亲切。我们一定要以‘斗私，批修’为纲，进一步搞好党委思想革命化，把党委建成无限忠于您的领导班子，把部队办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。”
    伟大统帅毛主席接见以后，同志们兴奋的心情久久不能平静，无论是年青的干部，还是年过半百的红军老战士，无不尽情地欢呼，放声地歌唱。他们连夜把毛主席接见的特大喜讯，最迅速地传给海边防前线、“三支”“两军”第一线和各个战斗岗位上的广大指战员。喜讯传到那里，那里就是一片欢腾，“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”口号声震撼大地，响彻云霄。被接见的同志连夜召开誓师大会，向毛主席献忠心，表决心。在誓师大会上，一一二四工地英雄集体、“临汾旅”、毛主席的好战士雷锋、刘英俊、蔡永祥和战斗英雄董存瑞、杨根思生前所在部队的领导干部和战斗英雄黄丑和、王立和，以及被接见的全体同志纷纷宣誓：海可枯，石可烂，忠于毛主席的红心永不变！地可动，山可摇，捍卫毛主席革命路线的决心永远不动摇！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！我们一定要把您的接见化为巨大的力量，一定要以林副主席为光辉榜样，永远忠于您，永远忠于您的光辉思想，永远忠于您的革命路线；象门合同志那样，“一切想着毛主席，一切服从毛主席，一切紧跟毛主席，一切为着毛主席”，把学习、执行、宣传、捍卫您的革命路线，作为毕生的战斗任务，把人类历史上没有先例的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把中国革命和世界革命进行到底！
