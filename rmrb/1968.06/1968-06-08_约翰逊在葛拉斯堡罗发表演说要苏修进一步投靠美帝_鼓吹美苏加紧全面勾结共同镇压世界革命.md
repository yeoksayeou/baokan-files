	Johnson in Glassboro advocates for the Soviet revisionists to further align with the U.S. Empire
	Advocates for U.S.-Soviet collaboration to jointly suppress world revolution

	NEW YORK, June 5 — GLASSBORO, N.J. — U.S. imperialist leader Johnson delivered a speech in Glassboro on June 4, advocating for further U.S.-Soviet collaboration to suppress the surging revolutionary struggles of the world's people.

	Glassboro, New Jersey, is where Johnson and the Soviet revisionist clique leader Kosygin plotted global counter-revolutionary collusion last June. One year later, amidst the U.S. empire's unprecedented internal and external difficulties and the deepening crisis of capitalism, with the awakening of the people in Europe and North America and the burgeoning revolutionary struggles, Johnson returned to Glassboro to deliver a speech, urging the Soviet revisionist clique to hasten the betrayal of the interests of the Soviet and world revolutionary peoples. Johnson himself admitted in his speech that he went to Glassboro last year with the aim of establishing a so-called world "order," that is, to suppress the revolutionary struggles of the world's people. Today, he returned to Glassboro with the same aim.

	Johnson's speech fully illustrates that the Soviet revisionist clique is the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism in maintaining the old world and the old order. Johnson admitted in his speech that the past year has been "a particularly tense and difficult period" for the United States, but in U.S.-Soviet relations, there have been "visible" "hopes and achievements," and in "promoting cooperation between the two countries," there has been no period in history more fruitful than this one. He particularly emphasized that despite the existence of the Vietnam War, the U.S. and the Soviet Union have reached agreements on a series of major issues, including the treaty prohibiting the placement of nuclear weapons in outer space, the U.S.-Soviet air agreement, and the U.S.-Soviet consular agreement, among others; especially recently, the U.S. and the Soviet Union have reached an agreement on the so-called "non-proliferation" treaty. The main purpose of this treaty is to attempt to maintain the U.S.-Soviet nuclear monopoly, so as to engage in nuclear blackmail and nuclear threats against other countries. He also wants the Soviet revisionist clique to begin establishing new cooperation plans with the United States in "many other areas."

	In his speech, Johnson demanded that the Soviet revisionist clique continue to "cooperate" with the United States on the Vietnam and Middle East issues to further suppress the struggles of the Vietnamese and Arab peoples. He particularly wants the Soviet revisionist clique to help the United States promote its "peace talks" deception, which is being vigorously pursued in Vietnam. He encouraged the Soviet clique, saying that when the U.S. and the Soviet Union are "willing to walk together for a while," the ruggedness of the path to seeking peace is greatly reduced.

	Johnson's speech is another confession of U.S.-Soviet collusion to suppress the revolutionary struggles of the world's people, once again fully exposing the shameful traitorous face of the Soviet revisionist clique as an accomplice of U.S. imperialism.

    约翰逊在葛拉斯堡罗发表演说要苏修进一步投靠美帝
    鼓吹美苏加紧全面勾结共同镇压世界革命
    新华社五日讯　葛拉斯堡罗消息：美帝国主义头子约翰逊四日在葛拉斯堡罗发表一篇演说，鼓吹美苏进一步加强全面勾结，镇压世界人民风起云涌的革命斗争。
    美国新泽西州的葛拉斯堡罗，是约翰逊和苏修叛徒集团头目柯西金去年六月密谋策划全球反革命大勾结的地方。一年后的今天，在美帝国主义内外困境空前严重，资本主义总危机不断深化，欧洲、北美人民加速觉醒，群众革命斗争蓬勃发展的形势下，约翰逊又跑到那里发表演说，要苏修叛徒集团加紧出卖苏联人民和世界革命人民的利益。约翰逊自己在演说里承认，他在去年抱着建立所谓世界“秩序”，即镇压世界人民革命斗争的目的，到葛拉斯堡罗“会晤了”柯西金，今天，他抱着同一个目的，又来到了葛拉斯堡罗。
    约翰逊的演说，十分充分地说明了苏修叛徒集团是帮助美帝国主义维护旧世界和旧秩序的头号帮凶。约翰逊在演说里承认，过去的一年，是美国的“一个特别紧张和困难的时期”，而在美苏关系上却取得了“看得见的”“希望和成就”，在“推进两国合作方面”，历史上没有那个时期比这个时期“更有成果”。他特别强调，尽管存在着越南战争，美苏之间还是在一系列重大问题上达成了协议，其中包括禁止在外层空间放置核武器条约，美苏通航条约和美苏领事协定等等；特别是不久前，美苏又就所谓“防止核扩散”条约达成了协议。这个条约的主要目的是妄图保持美苏核垄断地位，以便对其他国家进行核讹诈和核威胁。他还要苏修叛徒集团开始同美国“在另外许多方面建立新的合作计划”。
    约翰逊在演说中要求苏修叛徒集团继续在越南和中东问题上同美国“合作”，以便进一步镇压越南人民和阿拉伯人民的斗争。他特别要苏修叛徒集团帮助美国推行它在越南问题上正在加紧推行的“和谈”骗局。他鼓励苏修集团说，当美苏两国“愿意在一起走一段路的时候，谋求和平的道路的崎岖程度就大大减少”。
    约翰逊的演说，是美苏勾结镇压世界人民革命斗争的又一篇自供状，再一次充分暴露了苏修集团充当美帝帮凶的可耻叛徒嘴脸。
