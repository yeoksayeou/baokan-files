	Vietnamese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Issues Statement
	Condemns Thai Authorities' Forced Deportation of Vietnamese Residents to South Vietnam

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, the Vietnam News Agency reported that the spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on June 6 condemning the despicable act of the Thai reactionary authorities who decided to forcibly deport ninety Vietnamese residents in Thailand to South Vietnam.

	The statement said that the Thai authorities' decision to forcibly deport ninety Vietnamese residents to South Vietnam is another despicable action by the Thanom-Praphas reactionary clique to serve the U.S. imperialists and the Saigon puppet regime in their forced conscription. This is another piece of evidence that the Thai authorities are colluding with the U.S. imperialist invaders in their war against the Vietnamese people.

	The statement strongly protests against the Thai authorities' illegal decision and demands that the Thai authorities stop this criminal act.
