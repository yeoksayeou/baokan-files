Title: Between Master and Slave

The relationship between master and servant is generally one of mutual dependence. The master needs servants to serve him, thereby consolidating his position; the servant, in turn, takes it upon himself to safeguard the master's interests, in exchange for a few minor favors. The servant is dependent on the master, and the master cannot do without the servant.

The French Revisionist clique is a bunch of "servants and henchmen who kneel before imperialism." Recently, in order to help the French ruling clique extinguish the flames of the revolutionary mass movement, they have spared no effort. When the French ruling clique wants to suppress the revolutionary masses, they beat the drums and clear the way; when the French ruling clique wants to split the ranks of the revolutionary masses, they do their utmost to sow discord between workers and students; when the French ruling clique wants to lure striking workers back to work, they use every means to force workers to return to their jobs; when the French ruling clique brazenly dissolves workers' and students' organizations, they joyfully express their support. This bunch of traitors has played the despicable role of "the workers' petty officers for the capitalist class," fully revealing their servile nature.

The master-servant relationship between the French monopolistic bourgeoisie and the French Revisionist clique is not something new. The French Revisionist clique has always been a bunch of old traitors and scabs. If, in the past, this master-servant relationship was somewhat concealed, this time it has been thoroughly exposed. No wonder Western European bourgeois newspapers openly say that the French Revisionists' treacherous actions have "temporarily saved" the French ruling clique; and the French ruling clique's suppression of workers and students has "significantly" helped the French Revisionist clique. The open collusion and mutual assistance between the monopolistic bourgeoisie and its servants, without any restraint, is not accidental. It reflects the imperialists' abnormal behavior. It reflects the sharpening of the general crisis of capitalism, reflecting that a small clique of reactionaries feels that their end is approaching.

Imperialism and the capitalist system are like a sinking ship, sinking day by day. On this sinking ship, the imperialists and their servants are struggling desperately, trying to save themselves from destruction. However, no matter how much the master and servant collude and help each other, and no matter how ugly their performance, they cannot save each other. In the face of the world's revolutionary masses' overwhelming tide, imperialism and its faithful servants like the French Revisionist clique can only meet their doom together.

### 主奴之间

    主奴之间
    主子和奴才之间的关系，一般说来，是一种相互依赖的关系。主子需要奴才为他效劳，以巩固自己的地位；奴才则以维护主子的利益为己任，从而乞取一点小恩小惠。奴才依附于主子，主子也少不了奴才。
    法修叛徒集团是一小撮地地道道的“跪倒在帝国主义面前的奴仆和爪牙”。他们最近为了帮法国统治集团扑灭革命群众运动的烈火，可谓卖尽了力气。法国统治集团要镇压革命群众，他们就为之鸣锣开道；法国统治集团要分化革命群众队伍，他们就竭力在工人和学生中挑拨离间；法国统治集团要诱骗罢工工人停止斗争，他们就千方百计迫令工人复工；法国统治集团悍然解散工人和学生组织，他们就兴高采烈地表示支持。这一伙叛徒完全是扮演了“资本家阶级的工人尉官”的卑鄙角色，活现出一副十足的奴才相。
    法国垄断资产阶级同法修集团之间的主奴关系，并非自今日始。法修集团本来就是一伙老叛徒、老工贼。如果说，过去这种主奴关系还有一些半遮半掩，这一次则是暴露得十分彻底了。无怪乎西欧资产阶级报刊公开说，法修的叛卖行径“暂时拯救了”法国统治集团；而法国统治集团对工人学生的镇压则“显著地”给法修集团“帮了忙”。垄断资产阶级同它的奴才之间这样公开地互相勾结，互相帮忙，而无所忌讳，这种现象不是偶然的。这是帝国主义脱出常轨的表现。它反映了资本主义总危机的尖锐化，反映了一小撮反动派已经感到他们的末日正在日益临近。
    帝国主义、资本主义制度，好象一只破船，一天天地下沉了。在这只沉舟之上，帝国主义及其奴仆们正在进行垂死挣扎，企图挽救自己的覆灭。然而，主奴之间不管怎样互相勾结，互相帮忙，作出如何丑恶的表演，仍然是谁也救不了谁的命。在世界人民革命的排山倒海般的巨浪之中，帝国主义及其忠实奴仆法修集团之流，只能是同归于尽。
