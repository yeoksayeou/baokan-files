The revolutionary cadres of the First Automobile Works in Changchun, with the help of the leftist personnel from the Shenyang Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, have continuously raised their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. In the struggle against the enemy, they have led the masses in charging into battle, thereby consolidating and developing the revolutionary committee.

The New China News Agency, Changchun, June 25th: The leftist personnel from a certain unit of the Shenyang Military Region of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the First Automobile Works in Changchun have helped the revolutionary cadres of the factory who participate in the revolutionary three-in-one leadership teams at various levels to study the problems in the struggle between the two lines by learning from Comrade Men Hesheng, a good cadre who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. This has greatly raised their awareness of the struggle between the two lines. They actively led the broad revolutionary workers to launch a fierce attack on a small number of class enemies, consolidating the newly born revolutionary committee in the class struggle.

Some of the revolutionary cadres in this factory who participate in the revolutionary three-in-one leadership teams initially implemented the capitalist reactionary line during the early stages of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. As the struggle against the enemy deepened, they feared making mistakes again and dared not boldly lead the revolutionary workers into battle. Therefore, the masses reflected: "We go to the front line, but the cadres watch from the side, like water at thirty degrees, neither hot nor cold."

The leftist personnel of the People's Liberation Army addressed this situation by assisting the factory revolutionary committee in promptly organizing a Mao Zedong Thought study class. They organized revolutionary leading cadres at various levels to seriously study the glorious thoughts and heroic deeds of Comrade Men Hesheng in defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line throughout his life. They guided everyone to learn from the hero, find the gap, and raise their awareness of the struggle between the two lines. Wang Rongxing, the director of the Carriage Division Revolutionary Committee, after studying the glorious deeds of Comrade Men Hesheng, found the root cause of his not daring to boldly lead the masses into battle in the class struggle: it was the "private" character in his mind. He took Comrade Men Hesheng as an example, consciously bringing his problems in the struggle between the two lines to actively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, fighting against the "private" character, raising his awareness, and leading the masses to accurately and resolutely strike a small number of class enemies.

Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." The revolutionary cadres at various levels in this factory used Chairman Mao's latest instructions to arm their minds and guide their actions. They said: Liu Shaoqi's capitalist reactionary line is to protect class enemies and suppress the masses; Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is to protect the masses and suppress class enemies. We rely on the masses to launch an attack on class enemies, which represents the fundamental interests of the masses, best protects the people, and fully conforms to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. As a revolutionary leading cadre, one must, like Comrade Men Hesheng, resolutely execute and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, actively rely on and guide the broad revolutionary masses to launch a fierce attack on class enemies. According to the situation reflected by the masses, Gao Fenglou, the leader of the Casting Division's Gray Casting Cleaning Workshop Revolutionary Three-in-One Leadership Team, went deep into the masses, mobilized the masses to conduct investigations and research, and exposed a long-term hidden criminal who, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, infiltrated the masses' organizations, spread reactionary speeches, created divisions, and sabotaged the revolution and production. The Casting Division's Forging Workshop has a young worker from a poor peasant family who, influenced by anarchist thinking, often skipped work without reason and said many wrong things. Some revolutionary workers were very angry about his wrong words and deeds and advocated holding a struggle meeting against him. After hearing about this, Ma Deming, the leader of the workshop's revolutionary leadership team, recalled Comrade Men Hesheng's patient help to the masses who made mistakes during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and went deep into the masses. He organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly handling the two types of contradictions and, together with the masses, specifically analyzed and studied the young worker's performance since entering the factory. This made the workshop workers realize that the mistakes made by this worker belonged to contradictions within the people and that ideological and political work should be done to help him correct his mistakes, put down his burden, and actively participate in the revolutionary ranks. After the broad revolutionary masses did this, not only did they educate this young worker, but they also deeply moved other people who were deceived and made mistakes, and they all stood up to expose the class enemies who instructed them to do bad things.

The revolutionary leading cadres at various levels in this factory bravely led the masses into battle in the struggle against the enemy, striking a small number of class enemies hard, and making the revolutionary committees at various levels more consolidated. The revolutionary leading cadres throughout the factory are determined to better learn from Comrade Men Hesheng, lead the masses to advance victoriously, develop the good situation, and seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    结合阶级斗争实际活学活用毛主席著作
    依靠群众稳准狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人
    长春第一汽车制造厂革命干部在支左人员帮助下不断提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，在对敌斗争中同群众一道冲锋陷阵，使革委会得到巩固和发展
    新华社长春二十五日电　人民解放军沈阳部队某部驻长春第一汽车制造厂支左人员，帮助这个厂参加各级革命三结合领导班子的革命干部，带着两条路线斗争中的问题，认真向“无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部”门合同志学习，大大提高了两条路线斗争觉悟。他们积极带领广大革命职工向一小撮阶级敌人展开了猛烈进攻，在阶级斗争中巩固了新生的革命委员会。
    这个厂有些参加革命三结合领导班子的革命干部，在无产阶级文化大革命初期，执行过资产阶级反动路线。在对敌斗争深入展开以后，他们怕再犯错误，不敢大胆领导革命职工冲锋陷阵。因此，群众反映：“我们上火线，干部旁边看，象三十度的水，不冷不热的。”
    人民解放军支左人员针对这一情况，协助厂革命委员会及时举办了毛泽东思想学习班，组织各级革命领导干部，认真学习门合同志为捍卫毛主席无产阶级革命路线战斗一生的光辉思想和英雄事迹，引导大家学英雄，找差距，提高两条路线斗争觉悟。车厢分厂革命委员会主任王荣兴，学习了门合同志的光辉事迹以后，找到了自己在阶级斗争中不敢大胆带领群众冲锋陷阵的根子，是头脑里的“私”字在作怪。他以门合同志为榜样，自觉地带着自己在两条路线斗争中的问题活学活用毛泽东思想，狠斗“私”字，提高觉悟，带领群众稳、准、狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人。
    毛主席最近教导我们：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”这个厂各级革命干部用毛主席的最新指示武装自己的头脑，指导自己的行动。他们说：中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线，是保护阶级敌人，镇压群众的；毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，是保护群众，镇压阶级敌人的。我们依靠群众向阶级敌人发动进攻，就是代表了群众的根本利益，最好地保护人民群众，完全符合毛主席的革命路线。作为一个革命领导干部，就要象门合同志那样，坚决执行、誓死捍卫毛主席的革命路线，积极地依靠和引导广大革命群众向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻。铸造分厂灰口造型清理车间革命三结合领导小组组长高风楼根据群众反映的情况，深入到群众中去，发动群众调查研究，把一个长期隐瞒罪恶历史，在无产阶级文化大革命中又混入群众组织，散布反动言论，制造分裂，破坏抓革命、促生产的反革命分子揪了出来。铸造分厂可锻造型车间有一个贫农出身的青年工人，由于受无政府主义思潮影响，无故旷工，平时还说了不少错话。有些革命职工对他的错误言行很气愤，主张开他的斗争会。车间革命领导小组组长马德明听到这事以后，想起门合同志耐心帮助在无产阶级文化大革命中犯了错误的群众的事迹，就深入到群众中去，组织大家学习毛主席关于正确处理两类不同性质矛盾的教导，和群众一起具体分析研究了这个青年工人入厂以来的一贯表现，使车间职工认识到，这个工人所犯的错误，属于人民内部矛盾，应该对他进行思想政治工作，帮助他改正错误，放下包袱，积极参加革命战斗行列。广大革命群众这样做了以后，不仅教育了这个青年工人，也使其他一些受蒙蔽犯了错误的人深受感动，纷纷起来揭发了指使他们做坏事的阶级敌人。
    这个厂各级革命领导干部在对敌斗争中勇敢地带领群众冲锋陷阵，狠狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人，使各级革命委员会更加巩固。全厂革命领导干部决心更好地向门合同志学习，带领群众乘胜前进，发展大好形势，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
