Where there is oppression, there is resistance. The people of the Bodo tribe in Assam, India, have risen up to resist violence. Thousands of people have taken up weapons to bravely fight against reactionary police and repeatedly attacked police stations.

According to a report from New Delhi, the people of the Bodo tribe in Assam are rising up to resist the brutal oppression of the Indian reactionary government.

It is reported that for a long time, the Bodo people have been deeply dissatisfied with the brutal oppression of the Indian reactionary government and have demanded the establishment of their own autonomous region. The Indian reactionary government arbitrarily rejected the Bodo people's demand. To express their protest, the Bodo people boycotted the by-elections of the Indian Parliament. On May 19, the Bodo people surrounded the polling station in the Kokrajhar constituency, blocked the roads, and beat the Indian reactionary government officials in charge of the elections. The Indian reactionary government immediately sent a large number of police to suppress them. That evening, several thousand angry Bodo people, armed with sticks, spears, and other weapons, stormed the Indian police station in Sidli, fighting with the reactionary police and injuring fifteen police officers. They also released seventy-two detained Bodo people. The reactionary police, showing their ferocity, actually opened fire on the Bodo crowd.

However, the bloody suppression by the Indian reactionaries only sparked stronger resistance from the Bodo people. Starting from May 19, for several consecutive days, hundreds of Bodo people took up spears, swords, and bows and arrows, bravely fighting against the reactionary police. On May 22, five thousand Bodo people surrounded the Indian police station in Kokrajhar, demanding the release of over five hundred detained Bodo people. The reactionary police launched an attack on the crowd with tear gas and batons, but were firmly repelled by the Bodo people. After failing in their attack, the reactionary police opened fire on the Bodo crowd, injuring more than fifty people and arresting seven hundred fifty.

The bloody suppression by the Indian reactionaries did not intimidate the Bodo people. According to reports, on May 24, approximately four thousand Bodo people once again launched a fierce attack on the Indian police station in the Sidli area of Kokrajhar.

    哪里有压迫　哪里就有反抗
    印度阿萨姆邦博多族人民奋起抗暴
    数千群众拿起武器同反动警察英勇搏斗并一再猛袭警察局
    据新华社二十八日讯　新德里消息：印度阿萨姆邦博多族人民为反抗印度反动派的残酷压迫，正在奋起进行抗暴斗争。
    据报道，很久以来，博多族人民对印度反动政府的残酷压迫就深感不满，他们要求建立自己的自治区。印度反动政府蛮横无理地拒绝考虑博多族人民的这个要求。为了表示抗议，博多族人民对正在举行的印度议会的补选进行了抵制。五月十九日，博多族人民包围了科克拉贾尔选举区的投票场，拦住了道路，并痛击印度反动政府主持选举的官员。印度反动政府当即派出大批警察进行镇压。当晚，几千名愤怒的博多族人民手持木棍、长矛和其他武器，冲进了设在锡德利的印度警察局，同印度反动警察进行了搏斗，打伤了十五个警察，释放了七十二名被捕的博多族人民。印度反动警察凶相毕露，竟向博多族群众开枪射击。
    但是，印度反动派的血腥镇压，激起了博多族人民越来越强烈的反抗。从十九日起，一连几天，数以百计的博多族人民，拿起长矛、大刀和弓箭等武器，英勇地同印度反动警察进行搏斗。二十二日，五千名博多族人民包围了科克拉贾尔的印度警察局，坚决要求释放被捕的五百多名博多族人民。印度反动警察用催泪瓦斯和警棍向群众发动攻击，但是都被博多族群众坚决击退。印度反动警察在进攻失败后，竟向博多族群众开枪射击，打伤五十多人，逮捕了七百五十人。
    印度反动派的血腥镇压并没有吓倒博多族人民。据报道，二十四日，大约四千名博多族人民再一次对科克拉贾尔地区的锡德利印度警察局发动了猛烈袭击。
