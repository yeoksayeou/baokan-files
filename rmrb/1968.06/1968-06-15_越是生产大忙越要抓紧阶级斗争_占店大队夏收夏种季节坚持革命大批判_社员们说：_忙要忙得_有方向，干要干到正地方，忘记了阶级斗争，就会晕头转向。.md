The more the production rush, the more we must grasp class struggle
Zhandian Brigade maintains revolutionary criticism during summer harvest and planting

Members say: "Work must be done with direction, and efforts must be made in the right place. Forgetting class struggle will lead to confusion."

According to the Henan Daily, the Zhandian Brigade of Heying Commune in Wuzhi County, Henan Province, follows Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle." During the summer harvest and planting season, they closely combine actual tasks with revolutionary criticism, using revolution to lead production and using revolution to promote production. Revolutionary criticism is carried out vigorously, and the progress and quality of summer harvest and planting are both excellent.

In the previous period, the brigade carried out a vigorous revolutionary criticism, severely criticizing the handful of capitalist roaders within the party led by China's Khrushchev, raising the class consciousness and line struggle consciousness of the broad masses, and creating a great situation in revolution and production. After the summer harvest season arrived, some cadres and members had the idea of "stopping to grasp the revolution and focusing on production." They said, "Now the farm work is concentrated, and the labor intensity is high. Let's do the revolutionary criticism after the busy season."

Should the revolutionary criticism be temporarily stopped, or should it be carried out more vigorously during the busy season, putting revolution in the first place and using revolution to promote production? The brigade's cadres, with this question in mind, studied the great teachings of Chairman Mao: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work" and "Mastering ideological education is the key link in uniting the whole party to wage great political struggles. If this task is not solved, the party's political tasks cannot be completed." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, they unanimously agreed that the summer harvest and planting season is the most urgent and concentrated time for agricultural production, and it is also the time when the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, as well as the struggle between public and private interests, is most intense. If they focus only on production and neglect class struggle, the class enemy will create trouble; the "self" will blind the members' eyes, and production cannot be carried out well. Therefore, they must lead the broad poor and lower-middle peasants to continue to carry out in-depth revolutionary criticism, using revolution to promote the summer harvest, planting, and all other work.

To ensure that the revolutionary criticism continues without interruption, the brigade's leading members went deep into the production teams, organizing the masses to study Chairman Mao's statements on class struggle and reviewing the situation of the class struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads during the busy season in previous years. They analyzed the new trends and characteristics of the class struggle during this year's busy season. During last year's summer harvest and planting, some production teams were poisoned by China's Khrushchev, implementing the methods of "work points in command" and "material incentives." For example, increasing work points for harvesting and planting, keeping the wheat for oneself, or recording high work points by weighing, which affected collective production. The class enemy took the opportunity to spread rumors and create trouble, engaging in destructive activities. This year, during the summer harvest and planting, the class enemy is also conducting new destructive activities. They say things like, "If work points are not increased, attendance cannot be increased, and no one will work hard." The living facts made everyone deeply realize that the class struggle is more intense and complicated during the busy season. As long as the class struggle exists, revolutionary criticism cannot stop for a moment. Many poor and lower-middle peasant members said: If revolutionary criticism is not carried out for a day, the class enemy will become arrogant. No matter what the situation is, we must never forget class struggle. Forgetting class struggle is the greatest disloyalty to Chairman Mao. A poor peasant member of the Eighth Production Team, He Yin, said: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victory, and the wheat harvest has been good. This great situation must not be allowed to be destroyed by the enemy. We must defend it with struggle." To further raise the awareness of carrying out revolutionary criticism during the busy season, the poor and lower-middle peasants also exposed the class enemy's current destructive activities, further clarifying the members' minds. The members said: "Work must be done with direction, and efforts must be made in the right place. Forgetting class struggle will lead to confusion."

How to carry out revolutionary criticism? The brigade's leading group, based on the characteristics of the brigade's distant land, busy farm work, and high labor intensity, discussed with the poor and lower-middle peasants and adopted the method of "four combinations" and "four priorities": combining brigade-level centralized criticism with small-scale criticism in production teams or small areas, prioritizing small-scale criticism meetings; combining evening centralized criticism in production teams with field and yard criticism, prioritizing field and yard criticism; combining dining hall criticism with family criticism, prioritizing family study class criticism; combining written criticism with oral criticism, prioritizing oral criticism. This brigade, based on different types of work such as harvesting, threshing, rushing planting, early autumn management, and livestock feeding, helped each production team divide revolutionary criticism combat teams, focusing on the problems existing in the brigade, and launching a comprehensive criticism and attack on China's Khrushchev's reactionary fallacies such as "work points in command" and "material incentives." The Thirteenth Production Team originally had some members competing for work points and subsidies. After criticizing China's Khrushchev's reactionary fallacies of "material incentives," the whole team showed a new atmosphere of working without conditions and everyone for the collective. During the wheat harvesting in the First Production Team, two female members went to the field to pick wheat. When the poor and lower-middle peasants discussed in the field criticism meeting whether to hand over the picked wheat to the collective or take it home, which is a struggle between the two lines, the two female members immediately handed over the wheat they picked to the team. Later, they also organized more than a dozen women to pick wheat for the collective every day, determined to contribute more to the revolution.

Through revolutionary criticism, the brigade's revolution and production have created an unprecedented great situation. The cadres firmly walk the road of emphasizing proletarian politics, determined to be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The members think everywhere about farming for the revolution and contributing to socialism.

### 越是生产大忙越要抓紧阶级斗争  占店大队夏收夏种季节坚持革命大批判  社员们说：“忙要忙得 有方向，干要干到正地方，忘记了阶级斗争，就会晕头转向。”

    越是生产大忙越要抓紧阶级斗争
    占店大队夏收夏种季节坚持革命大批判
    社员们说：“忙要忙得 有方向，干要干到正地方，忘记了阶级斗争，就会晕头转向。”
    据河南日报报道　河南省武陟县何营公社占店大队遵照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，在夏收夏种大忙季节，紧密结合实际任务开展革命大批判，以革命统帅生产，用革命带动生产。革命大批判搞得轰轰烈烈，夏收夏种进度快，质量好。
    占店大队前一时期大力开展革命大批判，狠狠批判了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资派，提高了广大群众的阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟，革命、生产出现了一派大好形势。夏收大忙季节到来之后，部分干部和社员产生了“停一停抓革命，集中搞生产”的思想。他们说：“现在农活集中，劳动强度大，等大忙过后再搞革命大批判。”
    是把革命大批判暂时停下来，还是越忙越要搞好革命大批判，把革命放在首位，以革命带动生产？大队的干部带着这个问题，学习了伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。如果这个任务不解决，党的一切政治任务是不能完成的。”他们遵循毛主席的教导，一致认为夏收夏种是农业生产最紧迫、最集中的时刻，也是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争和公与私斗争比较尖锐的时刻。如果埋头抓生产，不抓阶级斗争，阶级敌人就会搞破坏；“私”字也会蒙住社员的眼睛，生产就不可能搞好。因此，必须带领广大贫下中农，继续深入开展革命大批判，以革命带动夏收夏种和各项工作。
    为了使革命大批判不停顿地深入开展下去，大队领导成员分头深入生产队，组织广大群众学习毛主席有关阶级斗争的论述，并回顾了往年大忙季节两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的情况，分析了今年大忙季节阶级斗争的新动向和新特点。去年夏收夏种中，个别生产队中了中国赫鲁晓夫的毒，实行了“工分挂帅”、“物质刺激”的办法。如收种提高工分，拾麦归己，或者过秤记高工分等，使集体生产受到影响，阶级敌人乘机煽阴风，点鬼火，大搞破坏活动。今年夏收夏种中，阶级敌人又在进行新的破坏活动。说什么“不提高工分，就不能增加出勤，就没人多干活。”活生生的事实，使大家深刻认识到：越在大忙季节，阶级斗争越是尖锐复杂。阶级斗争存在一天，革命大批判就一刻也不能停。不少贫下中农社员说：革命大批判一天不抓，阶级敌人就翘尾巴。我们无论在任何情况下，都必须念念不忘阶级斗争。忘记了阶级斗争，就是对毛主席的最大不忠。第八生产队贫农社员何印说：“无产阶级文化大革命取得了决定性胜利，小麦也取得了好收成。这个大好形势，决不能让敌人破坏，我们要以战斗来保卫。”为了进一步提高对大忙季节开展革命大批判的认识，贫下中农还把阶级敌人的现行破坏活动揭露出来，进一步擦亮社员的眼睛。社员们说：“忙要忙得有方向，干要干到正地方，忘记了阶级斗争，就会晕头转向。”
    怎样开展革命大批判？大队领导班子根据本队土地远，农活忙，劳动强度大的特点，经过和贫下中农商量，采取了“四结合”、“四为主”的办法：大队集中批判和分片或生产队小型批判相结合，以小型批判会为主；生产队晚上集中批判和田间、场边批判相结合，以田间、场边批判为主；饭场批判和家庭批判相结合，以家庭学习班批判为主；写批判文章和口头批判相结合，以口头批判为主。这个大队根据收割、打场、抢种、早秋管理、牲畜饲养等不同工种，帮助每个生产队划分革命大批判战斗小组，结合本队存在的问题，集中火力对中国赫鲁晓夫的“工分挂帅”、“物质刺激”等反动谬论，进行了全面的大批判，大进攻。第十三生产队原来有个别社员争工分，争补助，经过批判中国赫鲁晓夫“物质刺激”的反动谬论以后，全队出现了干活不讲条件，人人为集体的新气象。第一生产队在割大麦时，有两个女社员去田间拾麦。当贫下中农在田间批判会上辩论拾麦交集体，还是拿到自己家，是两条道路斗争的问题时，这两个女社员当时就把拾的麦子交给了队里，后来她们还串连了十几个妇女每天为集体拾麦，决心为革命多作贡献。
    经过革命大批判，这个大队的革命和生产出现了空前未有的大好局面。干部们坚定地走突出无产阶级政治的道路，决心无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。社员们处处想的是为革命种田，为社会主义多作贡献。
