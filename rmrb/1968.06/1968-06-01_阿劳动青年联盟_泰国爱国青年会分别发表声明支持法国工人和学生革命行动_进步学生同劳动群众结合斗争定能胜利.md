Albania Labour Youth League and Thai Patriotic Youth Association Issue Statements Supporting French Workers and Students' Revolutionary Actions
Progressive Students United with Working Masses Will Certainly Win

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency in Tirana on the 30th, the Albanian News Agency reported that the Student Department of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labour Youth League issued a statement on the 29th, supporting the revolutionary movement of French workers and students and condemning the treacherous acts of the Soviet revisionist clique and the French revisionist clique.

The statement said, French progressive youth have inherited the traditions of the Paris Commune members and anti-fascist fighters. With a lofty fighting spirit, they are engaged in a head-on struggle against the violence of the bourgeoisie's repressive machinery, exposing and thwarting the treacherous acts of revisionism and other bourgeois lackeys. The massive demonstrations and strike waves launched by the working class, students, and other working people have shaken the foundations of the French capitalist system, causing the lackeys of the monopoly capitalist system, revisionists, and Social Democrats to tremble in fear. The leaders of the French revisionist clique have openly sabotaged the revolutionary movement of progressive students, directly defending the interests of the exploiting class, and betraying the interests of young students. In this despicable plot, the French revisionist traitors have received support and encouragement from the Soviet revisionist clique. However, the facts have made French students see clearly, and they have cast aside the bourgeois lackeys, continuing their brave struggle. This shows that the revisionist traitors have been exposed, isolated, and discredited.

The statement emphasized that students must unite with the working class and the broad masses of workers to achieve combat unity and form a united front against fascism, imperialism, and monopoly capital. As long as progressive students take Marxism-Leninism as their guide and fight side by side with the French proletariat and other working masses in an uncompromising revolutionary struggle, they will certainly achieve victory.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 30th, the "Voice of the Thai People" radio station broadcast on the 29th that the Thai Patriotic Youth Association issued a statement on the 25th, firmly supporting the revolutionary actions of French workers and students against the monopoly capitalist ruling clique.

The statement said, recently, the workers, students, and revolutionary people of France and Western Europe and North America have launched a powerful revolutionary movement, marking a new awakening of the people of France, Western Europe, and North America. People of the world are jubilant.

The statement said, the magnificent revolutionary struggle launched by French workers and students has caused great panic among the monopoly bourgeoisie, reactionaries, and modern revisionists of various countries. They have colluded with each other, attempting to extinguish this fiery revolutionary movement. However, the French revolutionary people have resolutely exposed the enemy's tricks and persisted in their revolutionary struggle.

The statement pointed out that the great teacher of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, teaches: "All the people of the world must have courage, dare to fight, fear no difficulties, and advance bravely. In that case, the whole world will certainly belong to the people. All devils will be destroyed." The statement said, as long as we resolutely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, the whole world will certainly belong to the people.

The statement finally expressed that Thai youth should learn from the fearless revolutionary spirit of French workers and students and support the revolutionary struggle of the French people with practical actions. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, the Thai people will persist in revolutionary armed struggle and certainly build a new Thailand. The revolutionary people of the world, united and fighting together, will certainly build a new world.

    阿劳动青年联盟  泰国爱国青年会分别发表声明支持法国工人和学生革命行动
    进步学生同劳动群众结合斗争定能胜利
    据新华社地拉那三十日电　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道，阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟中央委员会学生部，二十九日发表声明，支持法国工人和学生的革命运动，谴责苏修集团和法修集团的叛卖行径。
    声明说，法国进步青年继承了巴黎公社成员和反法西斯战士的传统。他们以崇高的战斗精神同资产阶级镇压机器的暴力进行针锋相对的斗争，揭露和挫败了修正主义和其他资产阶级走狗的叛卖行径。工人阶级、学生和其他劳动人民掀起的声势浩大的示威游行和罢工浪潮，冲击了法国资本主义制度，同时使得为垄断资本制度效劳的走卒、修正主义者、社会民主党人吓得发抖。法国修正主义集团的头目公开破坏进步学生的革命运动，直接维护剥削阶级的利益，背叛青年学生的利益。在这一卑鄙的阴谋中，法修叛徒得到了苏联修正主义集团的支持和怂恿。但是，种种事实使法国学生擦亮了眼睛，他们把资产阶级走狗抛在一边，继续进行英勇的斗争。这表明修正主义叛徒已被揭露、孤立，声名狼藉。
    声明强调说，学生只有同工人阶级和广大劳动群众联合起来，才能实现战斗的团结，组成反法西斯、反帝和反垄断资本的统一战线。进步学生只要以马克思列宁主义思想为指针，同法国无产阶级和其他劳动群众肩并肩地进行毫不妥协的革命斗争，就一定能取得胜利。
    据新华社三十日讯　据“泰国人民之声”电台二十九日广播，泰国爱国青年会二十五日发表声明，坚决支持法国工人、学生大造垄断资本统治集团的反的革命行动。
    声明说，最近，法国和西欧、北美的工人、学生和革命人民掀起了一场声势浩大的革命运动，这标志着法国、西欧、北美人民的新觉醒。全世界革命人民为之欢欣鼓舞。
    声明说，法国工人、学生掀起的这场波澜壮阔的革命斗争，使各国垄断资产阶级、反动派和现代修正主义恐慌万状。它们相互勾结，妄图扑灭这场如火如荼的革命运动。但是，法国革命人民坚决揭露了敌人的阴谋诡计，坚持革命斗争。
    声明指出，世界革命人民的伟大导师毛主席教导说：“全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”声明说，只要我们坚决遵照毛主席的教导去做，全世界就一定是属于人民的。
    声明最后表示，泰国青年要学习法国工人、学生的大无畏的革命精神，并将以实际行动支援法国人民的革命斗争。我们坚信，泰国人民在泰国共产党的领导下，坚持革命武装斗争，一定能够建立起一个新泰国。全世界革命人民团结战斗在一起，一个新的世界一定能够建立起来。
