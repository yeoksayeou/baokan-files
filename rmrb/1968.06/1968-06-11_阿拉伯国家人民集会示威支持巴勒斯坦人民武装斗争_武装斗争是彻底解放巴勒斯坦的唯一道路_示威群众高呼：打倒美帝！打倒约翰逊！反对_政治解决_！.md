On the first anniversary of the Arab people's resistance against the U.S.-Israeli aggression, various sectors of the Iraqi people held mass rallies and demonstrations to express their firm support for the Palestinian people's revolutionary armed struggle against the counter-revolutionary armed attacks of the U.S.-Israeli aggressors, to liberate the occupied lands, and to oppose those who, under the banner of "political solution," are promoting various colonialist deceptions. Leaders of the Iraqi government and some mass organizations also made speeches and issued statements to support the just struggle of the Palestinian people.

Iraqi Prime Minister Abdul Rahman Arif said in a televised speech in Baghdad on the evening of June 4 that the Iraqi government firmly rejects all peace solutions based on the recognition of colonial aggression. He said that the Iraqi government deeply understands and believes in the people's war of liberation, and therefore supports the fighting of the (Palestinian) guerrillas.

He said, "We are ready to confront the battles of imperialism and Zionism."

On the evening of June 5, a mass rally was held in Baghdad, where leaders of various mass organizations highly praised the heroic spirit shown by Palestinian guerrillas in the Israeli-occupied areas and warmly hailed the great victories achieved by the Palestinian people in their armed struggle. They pointed out that armed struggle is the only way to completely liberate Palestine and called on all Arab people to give firm and effective support to the armed struggle of the Palestinian people.

A representative of "Fatah" (Palestinian Liberation Movement) spoke at the meeting, severely criticizing those who place their hopes for solving the Palestinian problem on the United Nations and some criminal big powers.

He stressed that in the course of the struggle, the Palestinian people have found the only correct way to liberation, which is to liberate their homeland through armed struggle. He said that Palestinian guerrillas bear the responsibility of liberating Palestine, and they have the determination and ability to wage this war until final victory.

In the morning of June 5, Palestinians in Baghdad and Iraqi workers, students, and other masses held a demonstration march. They held banners reading: "Armed struggle is the only way to reclaim Palestinian land!" The demonstrators angrily raised their fists and shouted: "Down with American imperialism!" "Oppose 'political solution,' insist on armed struggle!" "People's war, people's war!"

Meanwhile, some other Arab countries also held mass rallies and demonstration marches on June 5 to commemorate the first anniversary of the Arab people's resistance against the U.S.-Israeli aggression.

In the Syrian capital Damascus and other cities, mass rallies were held on June 5. At these rallies, many speakers called for mobilizing all the forces of the Arab people to fight against imperialism and Zionism, and condemned various surrenderist solutions to the Palestinian problem. They also pointed out that the people's war of liberation is the only way to liberate the occupied Arab lands. They called on the Syrian people to join this struggle.

In the Sudanese capital Khartoum, thousands of Sudanese people held a demonstration on June 5 to protest against the U.S.-Israeli aggression on the Arab world and to support the armed struggle of the Palestinian people. The demonstrators shouted slogans such as "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with Johnson!" "Long live the struggle of the Arab people!" "'Political solution' is a deception!" "No freedom without guns!" "Armed struggle is the only way to liberate Palestine and the occupied Arab lands!"

At the same time, a massive demonstration march with 24,000 participants was held in Sayda, the administrative capital of southern Lebanon. The demonstrators carried banners and signs, demanding support for the activities of the Palestinian commando units and strengthening Lebanon's border defenses to repel Israeli aggression.
