The masses of the Gate Iron Camp Brigade in Gu'an County, Hebei, have continuously raised their ideological awareness through the organization of various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The story of Li Baohua's family "chasing the pig" vividly illustrates this point.

One noon, as soon as Li Baohua entered the house, he heard his father saying to his elder brother, "You sold the sick pig to someone, which does not align with Chairman Mao's teachings. This is the 'private' character coming out. You should thoroughly examine yourself in the study class." His elder brother, Baojun, replied, "I was afraid the disease would spread to the entire village, so I sold it." Baohua, upon hearing this, realized that his brother's thinking had taken a wrong turn and said, "It seems you were thinking of the collective, but in reality, you were only considering the small collective and forgetting the larger collective. This is an exaggerated form of individualism. We must get the pig back." His elder brother felt embarrassed and did not want to go. His father said, "Exposing one's faults is not shameful, struggling against selfishness is not painful, correcting mistakes is not embarrassing. This shows a lack of loyalty to Chairman Mao. If you don't go, I will!" With that, he took the receipt and was about to leave. At this moment, Baohua quickly led everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "completely selfless and dedicated to others," which made Baojun deeply realize that "selling the sick pig was due to the 'private' character acting up, it was influenced by the poison of the Chinese Khrushchev. We must uproot this poisonous tumor." Saying this, he took the receipt from his father's hand and went to find the buyer.

He ran more than twenty miles and finally found the buyer. However, the buyer was a bit puzzled about the matter and did not want to return the pig. Baojun then explained the whole process. The buyer was deeply moved, returned the sick pig, and expressed his desire to learn from the militiamen of Gate Iron Camp.

专栏：在毛泽东思想学习班里

    李宝军斗私
    河北固安县门铁营大队广大群众，通过举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，社员的思想觉悟不断提高。基干民兵李宝华一家“追猪”的故事，就生动地说明了这一点。
    一天中午，李宝华一进家门，就听见爸爸对他哥哥说：“你把病猪卖给人家，这不符合毛主席的教导，这是‘私’字冒尖，回头你在学习班里要好好检查。”他哥哥宝军说：“我是怕猪病传染到全村，才卖了的。”李宝华一听，就知哥哥的思想走了“小道”，便说：
  “看起来你是为了集体，实际上你是顾了小集体，忘了大集体，这是放大了的个人主义，必须把猪追回来。”他哥哥嫌寒伧，不愿意去，他爸爸说：“亮私不怕丑，斗私不怕疼，改正错误还怕寒伧，这是对毛主席缺乏忠心，你不去我去！”说着拿过税票要走。这时，宝华马上带着大家一起学习了毛主席关于“毫不利己专门利人”的教导，使宝军深刻地认识到：“卖病猪是‘私’字作怪，是中了中国赫鲁晓夫的毒，一定要把这毒疮连根刨掉。”说着就从他爸爸手里接过税票去找买主。
    他跑了二十多里地，好容易找到了买主，可是买主对这事有点纳闷，不愿退猪。宝军随即把过程说了一遍，买主大受感动，退回了病猪，并表示向门铁营的民兵学习。
