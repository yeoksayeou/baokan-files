The revolutionary workers of the Bengbu Railway Bureau, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist cadres, have firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teaching, "Never forget class struggle," and have intensified class struggle, developing a good situation. The entire bureau is presenting a lively scene of combining revolution with production.

Currently, 117 units within the bureau have established revolutionary committees or revolutionary leading groups. The bureau's revolutionary committee was also recently born in victory. The bureau has held 432 sessions of various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with over 95% of revolutionary workers participating in the study. The widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought and the deepening understanding of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line have greatly promoted the ideological revolution of the revolutionary workers and driven the development of production. Since this spring, the bureau's railway transportation tasks have been completed better each month. In April, the average daily volume of goods loaded and unloaded increased by 20% and 55% respectively compared to March. In May, these figures increased by 42.4% and 43.9% respectively compared to April, with the number of trains passing through increasing by 23.2%. In the first ten days of June, there was a significant increase compared to the same period in May.

The railway lines under the jurisdiction of the Bengbu Railway Bureau bear the heavy responsibility of transporting important industrial and agricultural materials such as coal, steel, and grain, playing a crucial role in China's railway transportation. For a long time, class struggle here has been sharp and complex. The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the railway transportation department have fiercely opposed emphasizing proletarian politics and Mao Zedong Thought, engaging in treachery, forming cliques, and promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, attempting to restore capitalism. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a handful of class enemies, driven by their counter-revolutionary instincts, emerged, creating disturbances and attempting to muddy the waters and slip through. However, the broad revolutionary workers, armed with great Mao Zedong Thought and aided by the People's Liberation Army's leftist cadres, exposed the enemies' plots and tricks, repelled their counterattacks, achieved revolutionary great unity, seized the power they had usurped, and strengthened the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution under the conditions of socialism, where the proletariat opposes the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the broad revolutionary people led by it, and the Kuomintang reactionaries. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Chairman Mao's latest instructions have greatly educated and inspired the broad revolutionary workers. They have advanced, exposing the handful of traitors, spies, and remnants of the Kuomintang hidden within the bureau, and thoroughly exposing and criticizing their counter-revolutionary criminal activities. This has further raised the class struggle consciousness and line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary workers, consolidated and developed the revolutionary great unity, and promoted the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

After the birth of the revolutionary committees, they actively led the broad revolutionary workers in a sustained and in-depth revolutionary big criticism, launching a more vigorous attack on the class enemies. They fully utilized various forms such as big-character posters, criticism meetings, and study classes to thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist goods advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, such as the "extinction of class struggle" theory, "material incentives," and "business first." Through the revolutionary big criticism, Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line have been further internalized, and the entire bureau is filled with a strong proletarian political atmosphere.

    狠抓阶级斗争  发展大好形势
    蚌埠铁路分局运输任务完成得好
    革命的大联合不断巩固发展，全局到处洋溢着无产阶级政治空气
    据新华社合肥十三日电　蚌埠铁路分局广大革命职工在解放军支左人员的帮助下牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，狠抓阶级斗争，发展大好形势，全局呈现一派热气腾腾的抓革命促生产的新气象。
    目前，全分局已有一百一十七个单位成立了革命委员会或革命领导小组，分局革命委员会也在最近胜利诞生。分局办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班四百三十二期，百分之九十五以上的革命职工参加了学习。毛泽东思想的大普及大传播，毛主席革命路线的越来越深入人心，大大促进了广大革命职工的思想革命化，推动了生产的大发展。今春以来，分局铁路运输任务完成得一个月比一个月好，四月份的日平均货物装车量和卸车量，比三月份分别提高百分之二十和百分之五十五；五月份又比四月份分别提高百分之四十二点四和百分之四十三点九，列车通过量提高百分之二十三点二。六月上旬又比五月同期有大幅度增长。
    蚌埠铁路分局所辖线路担负着煤炭、钢铁、粮食等工农业重要物资的繁重运输任务，在我国铁路交通运输战线上占有重要地位。长期以来，这里的阶级斗争一直很尖锐很复杂。中国赫鲁晓夫及其在铁路交通部门的代理人，疯狂地反对突出无产阶级政治，反对毛泽东思想，招降纳叛，结党营私，推行反革命修正主义路线，企图复辟资本主义。在无产阶级文化大革命中，一小撮阶级敌人又出于反革命本能，跳了出来，制造事端，妄想把水搅浑，蒙混过关。但是，用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的广大革命职工，在人民解放军支左人员的帮助下，戳穿了敌人的阴谋诡计，打退了他们的反扑，实现了革命的大联合，夺了他们所窃取的权力，加强了无产阶级专政。
    伟大领袖毛主席英明地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”毛主席的这一最新指示，给了广大革命职工极大的教育，极大的鼓舞。他们乘胜前进，把长期隐藏在分局内的一小撮叛徒、特务等国民党的残渣余孽，一个个地挖出来，并且对其反革命罪恶活动进行了大揭发、大批判，从而进一步提高了广大革命职工的阶级斗争觉悟和路线斗争觉悟，巩固和发展了革命大联合，促进了革命三结合。
    革命委员会诞生以后，积极带领广大革命职工，持久而深入地开展革命大批判，向阶级敌人发起更加猛烈的进攻。他们充分利用大字报、批判会、学习班等各种形式，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭”论、“物质刺激”、“业务挂帅”等反革命修正主义黑货，进行了层层大剥皮。通过革命的大批判，毛泽东思想和毛主席的革命路线更加深入人心，全局到处洋溢着浓厚的无产阶级政治空气。
