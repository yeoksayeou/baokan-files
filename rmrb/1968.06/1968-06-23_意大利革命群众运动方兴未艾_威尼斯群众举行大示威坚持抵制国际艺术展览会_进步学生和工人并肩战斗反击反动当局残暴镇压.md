The revolutionary mass movement of Italian students and workers against the oppression and exploitation of monopoly capital and the decaying capitalist system continues to surge forward. Progressive students and workers support each other and fight side by side, bravely resisting the brutal suppression by the Italian reactionary authorities.

In the famous Italian city of Venice, local people, with the support of students from other Italian cities and from West Germany and France, have persistently boycotted the 34th Venice International Art Exhibition, opposing the decaying capitalist system. On the evening of June 19, a massive demonstration was held for the second consecutive day in the central area of Venice. The "Committee for Revolutionary Students, Workers, and Intellectuals to Boycott the Biennial Art Exhibition" issued a declaration stating: "Italian revolutionary students, workers, and intellectuals resolutely oppose 'culture backed by big capital and combined with market interests.' The declaration pointed out that this decaying culture and the bourgeois pseudo-democratic system 'are not for the people but for big capital.' The declaration called on Italian students, workers, and intellectuals to strengthen their unity and jointly fight against monopoly capital.

When the demonstrators, holding red flags, entered St. Mark's Square, they were brutally suppressed by more than 2,000 police officers. The police wielded batons and savagely beat the demonstrators. Students and workers fought back, engaging in fierce struggles with the police until late into the night, lasting over four hours. Forty-six demonstrators were unlawfully arrested by the Italian authorities. During the police's frenzied suppression, many foreigners were also beaten and arrested.

The Italian authorities' brutal suppression of the people has sparked widespread indignation. On June 20, out of 22 Italian artists participating in the exhibition, 18 either removed their works or covered them up to protest against the reactionary authorities. Three French artists also withdrew from the exhibition to support the struggles of the French and Italian people. The director of the Swedish exhibition issued a statement saying that due to the "provocative increase in police forces around and within the exhibition area," the Swedish exhibition decided to close.

About 100 artists, critics, and intellectuals from Italy and other countries sent telegrams of protest to the Italian President, the Presidents of the two houses of Parliament, and the Mayor of Venice. The telegram pointed out that they were "angry at the unreasonable and brutal suppression of students and artists by a large police force" and demanded the dismissal of the police chief, the withdrawal of the police forces, and the closure of the exhibition. Journalists from Scandinavia also sent telegrams to the Italian Minister of the Interior and the police chief of Venice, "strongly protesting against this shocking police brutality."

Venice's dock workers and 10,000 chemical workers went on strike for 24 hours on June 21 to support the just struggle of students and artists.

In Trieste, striking metal workers, with the support of students, held a demonstration and march in the city center on June 21 to protest against several local shipyards not providing full employment for workers. The police used batons and tear gas to brutally suppress the demonstrators, injuring many. Workers and students retaliated with stones. The demonstrators also rushed into the international exhibition that opened in Trieste on June 21, smashing the display windows of several pavilions and overturning the cars of officials.

    进步学生和工人并肩战斗反击反动当局残暴镇压
    新华社二十二日讯　罗马消息：意大利学生、工人反对垄断资本的压迫和剥削，反对腐朽的资本主义制度的群众运动，继续汹涌澎湃地向前发展。进步学生与工人互相支持，并肩战斗，英勇地反击意大利反动当局的残暴镇压。
    在意大利著名城市威尼斯，当地人民在来自意大利其他城市和西德、法国的学生的支援下，坚持抵制第三十四届威尼斯国际艺术展览会，反对腐朽的资本主义制度。六月十九日晚上，在威尼斯市中心区接连第二天举行了声势浩大的游行示威。“革命学生、工人和知识分子抵制两年一度艺术展览会的委员会”发表的宣言说：意大利革命的学生、工人和知识分子坚决反对“以大资本为后台、同市场利益相结合的文化”。宣言指出，这种腐朽的文化以及资产阶级的假民主制度，“不是为人民服务的，而是为大资本服务的”。宣言号召意大利学生、工人和知识分子加强团结，共同进行反对垄断资本的斗争。
    当示威者高举红旗进入圣马克广场时，遭到两千多名警察的残暴镇压。警察挥舞棍棒，野蛮地殴打示威者。学生与工人奋起反击，同警察激烈搏斗到深夜，历时四个多小时。有四十六名示威者遭到意大利当局无理逮捕。警察在疯狂的镇压中，还毒打和逮捕了许多外国人。
    意大利当局残暴镇压人民的暴行激起普遍的义愤。二十日，参加这次展览会的二十二位意大利艺术家中的十八人，有的取走了自己的作品，有的把作品覆盖起来，对反动当局表示抗议。三位法国艺术家也退出展览会，以声援法国和意大利人民的斗争。瑞典展览馆的负责人发表声明说，由于“在展览会周围和展览会地区的警察部队挑衅性地增加”，瑞典展览馆决定关闭。
    约一百名意大利和其他国家的艺术家、评论家和知识界人士，纷纷向意大利总统、议会两院议长和威尼斯市长发出抗议电报。电报指出，他们对“大批警察部队对学生和艺术家们的毫无道理的残暴镇压感到愤怒”，他们要求把警察局长撤职，把警察部队撤走，并且封闭这个展览会。斯堪的那维亚的记者，也打电报给意大利内政部长和威尼斯的警察头子，“强烈抗议这种骇人听闻的警察暴行”。
    威尼斯的码头工人和一万名化学工人二十一日罢工二十四小时，声援学生和艺术界人士的正义斗争。
    在的里亚斯特，罢工的五金工人在学生的支援下，二十一日在市中心举行示威游行，抗议当地的几个造船厂不让工人充分就业。大批警察使用棍棒和催泪弹进行残暴镇压，打伤了许多示威者。工人和学生用石块向警察反击。示威者还冲进了二十一日在的里亚斯特开幕的国际展览会，捣毁了几个馆的展览橱窗，并推倒了官员乘坐的汽车。
