This year's "Three Summer" campaign is being carried out amidst the triumphant songs of the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, are filled with the joy of victory and revolutionary fervor, determined to win this year's "Three Summer" battle.

However, a handful of class enemies, in a desperate attempt to save their doomed fate, have adopted more cunning and despicable means to sabotage the "Three Summer" production and disrupt the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Take our village, for example. Before the wheat harvest, a handful of class enemies spread rumors and stirred up trouble, even inciting the masses to leave their production posts to engage in sideline activities elsewhere. After discovering this situation, with the help of the military agricultural support team, we promptly organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes and launched a revolutionary criticism campaign, launching a more ferocious attack on the class enemies and foiling the evil plots of a handful of class enemies.

However, "the enemy will not perish of itself." When we started harvesting the wheat, the class enemies played new tricks, desperately advocating for speeding up the pace and loudly proclaiming that production should be prioritized over revolution. They attempted to use production as a cover to disrupt the revolution and interfere with the revolutionary criticism campaign. However, the poor and lower-middle peasants who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao have the reddest hearts and the keenest eyes. With the help of the military agricultural support team, we not only insisted on "Daily Reading" but also used every available opportunity in the fields to conduct extensive and in-depth revolutionary criticism using living class struggle facts. In this way, the class enemies' plots met with a shameful failure. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have become more sober-minded and more spirited, creating a great situation where everyone contributes to the "Three Summer" campaign and everyone is busy with it.

We, the poor and lower-middle peasants, deeply understand that the class struggle in our village has not ended; on the contrary, the class struggle is long-term and tortuous. We must firmly grasp the initiative of the class struggle, seize the revolution, and vigorously promote production to achieve double victories in revolution and production.

    从政治上打好“三夏”这一仗
    今年的“三夏”是在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中进行的，我们广大贫下中农满怀胜利的喜悦和革命的豪情，决心打好今年“三夏”这一仗。
    但是，一小撮阶级敌人为了挽救他们即将灭亡的命运，采取了更加狡猾、更加卑鄙的手段，妄图破坏“三夏”生产，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。就拿俺村来说吧，在小麦收割以前，一小撮阶级敌人就制造谣言、播弄是非，甚至煽动群众离开生产岗位到外地去搞副业。我们发现这种情况后，在解放军支农小组的帮助下，及时开办了毛泽东思想学习班，开展革命大批判，向阶级敌人发起更猛烈的进攻，粉碎了一小撮阶级敌人的罪恶阴谋。
    但是“敌人是不会自行消灭的”，在我们开镰收割小麦时，阶级敌人又耍出新的花招，拚命鼓吹赶进度，还大肆叫嚷抓生产不要去抓革命了。他们妄图借生产之名，行破坏革命和干扰革命大批判之实。但是，无限忠于毛主席的贫下中农心最红，眼最亮。在解放军支农小组的帮助下，我们不仅坚持了“天天读”，而且在田间地头利用一切可以利用的机会，用活生生的阶级斗争事实，广泛深入地开展了革命大批判。这样一来，阶级敌人的阴谋，遭到了可耻的失败。广大贫下中农头脑更加清醒，斗志更加昂扬，出现了人人为“三夏”出力，个个为“三夏”奔忙的大好形势。
    我们贫下中农深深懂得：俺村的阶级斗争并没有因此而结束，相反，阶级斗争是长期的、曲折的。我们一定要牢牢掌握阶级斗争的主动权，狠抓革命，猛促生产，夺取革命和生产的双胜利。
