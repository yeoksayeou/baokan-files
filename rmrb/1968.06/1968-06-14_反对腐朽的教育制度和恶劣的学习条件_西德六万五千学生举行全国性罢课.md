	West Germany’s 65,000 students from 132 engineering schools began a nationwide strike and massive demonstrations on June 11, protesting against the country's corrupt educational system.

	Students from engineering schools in Bavaria and North Rhine-Westphalia declared an indefinite strike; students from other engineering schools will continue their strike for two weeks.

	On June 11, students carried numerous banners and chanted slogans as they marched in demonstrations. In Munich, over 5,000 students gathered in front of the Bavarian State Education Department to protest. The demonstration by students in Wuppertal paralyzed city traffic. Students in Hanover also formed groups to spread propaganda among the citizens.

	Students from engineering schools in Essen, Cologne, Saarbrücken, and other cities also held strikes and demonstrations.

	In Munich, 400 students from the Sports Academy also went on strike on the same day, protesting their “disastrous” learning conditions.

	At the same time, more than 1,000 students from four engineering schools in West Berlin defied police threats and held strikes and protest demonstrations.

	Since the beginning of this year, West German students have been continuously fighting against the corrupt educational system. On June 5, 4,500 engineering school students in Lower Saxony held a two-day strike. Before that, students from medical universities and some vocational schools in West Germany had also gone on strike, protesting against the corrupt educational system and poor learning conditions.

    新华社波恩十二日电　西德一百三十二个工程学校的六万五千名学生十一日开始举行全国性罢课和声势浩大的示威游行，反对西德现行的腐朽教育制度。
    巴伐利亚和北来因—威斯特伐利亚州工程学校的学生们宣布无限期罢课；其它工程学校学生的罢课将继续两周。
    十一日，学生们举着无数标语牌，高呼口号举行了示威游行。慕尼黑的五千余名学生到这个市所在的巴伐利亚州教育部前举行示威。伍佩尔塔尔学生的示威游行使市内交通陷于瘫痪。汉诺威的学生们还组成小组分别向市民进行宣传。
    在埃森、科隆、萨尔布吕肯等地工程学校的学生都举行了罢课和示威。
    在慕尼黑，四百名体育学院的学生也在同一天举行罢课，抗议他们“灾难性”的学习条件。
    在西德学生举行罢课和示威的同时，西柏林四个工程学校的一千余名学生也不顾警察当局的威胁，举行了罢课和抗议示威游行。
    今年以来，西德学生不断进行反对现行腐朽教育制度的斗争。六月五日在下萨克森有四千五百名工程学校学生举行了两天的罢课。在这以前，西德的医科大学和一些职业学校学生都举行过罢课，反对腐朽的教育制度和恶劣的学习条件。
