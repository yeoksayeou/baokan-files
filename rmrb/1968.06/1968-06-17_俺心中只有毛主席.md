	My Heart Belongs Only to Chairman Mao
	Active Learner and Applier of Mao Zedong Thought, Ding Yulan, a Poor Peasant from Gaojia Village, Huajiatun Commune, Jin County, Liaoning Province

	“A ship in the ocean relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought.” In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by our great leader Chairman Mao, under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao’s May 7th Directive, and with the help of the PLA comrades, our family set up a Mao Zedong Thought study class early on. With boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, I studied Chairman Mao’s revolutionary works and learned many revolutionary truths. I never dreamed that I, an old woman who begged for decades in the old society, could study Chairman Mao’s works today. I feel that only by reading Chairman Mao’s books, listening to Chairman Mao’s words, and acting according to Chairman Mao’s instructions, constantly transforming my thoughts, can I remain loyal to Chairman Mao and follow him closely forever. In the past, I sat on the warm kang, guarding a few rooms, caring only about my family’s affairs, with only my family of a few people in my heart. Now, I stand at the door, looking towards Beijing, thinking of the whole world, caring about national affairs, with only our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao in my heart.

	Long live Chairman Mao!

	I am seventy-five years old this year. When the study class first started, I thought, at my age, I am almost ready to be buried, and I don’t know a single character. Can I really study? Later, I participated in the team’s activities to praise Chairman Mao’s great achievements, recalled bitterness and sweetness with everyone, and engaged in revolutionary criticism and struggle, receiving great education. I understood that today’s good days did not come easily. When I heard that Chairman Mao led the revolutionary people of the whole country through countless hardships and difficulties to achieve revolutionary victory, and only then did we poor and lower-middle peasants stand up and gain today’s happy life, I was deeply moved. Listening, listening, I started to cry. I thought, heaven and earth are not as great as the Party’s kindness, Chairman Mao is truly the closest person to us poor and lower-middle peasants. Looking at Chairman Mao’s portrait, thinking of the past, looking at the present, I recalled many past events.

	In the evil old society, eleven of my family members were cruelly killed. When I was fourteen, my father was beaten to death by the heartless landlord while working for him. After my father died, my mother led us sisters to beg for food everywhere. Soon, my mother was driven to despair by life and died. My sister, younger sister, and little brother died or were sold. When I was sixteen, I married into the poor peasant Zhao family. After getting married, not a few years later, four people in my in-laws’ family died of hunger and overwork. I gave birth to eight sons, two of whom also starved to death. I begged for food from Shandong to the Northeast, from a child who didn’t understand anything to over fifty years old. The landlord’s vicious dog bit off my right ear, biting me all over, almost killing me. If it weren’t for Chairman Mao saving me, who knows where this old woman would have ended up! Because of Chairman Mao, there is Ding Yulan, and there is today’s poor and lower-middle peasants. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, I want to shout a thousand and ten thousand times: “Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!” I want to wish you, respected old man, a thousand and ten thousand times long life!

	Parents’ kindness is deep, but it cannot compare to Chairman Mao’s. Day and night, I think of Chairman Mao. Our family has hung dozens of Chairman Mao’s portraits, making the whole family bright. The four walls of my inner room are all hung with Chairman Mao’s portraits, and I can see him from the kang in all four directions. I also hung Chairman Mao’s portrait in the outer room, and when I cook, I can see Chairman Mao as soon as I look up. While cooking, I look at Chairman Mao’s portrait and recite Chairman Mao’s quotations, “Three Constantly Read Articles,” and sing songs of Chairman Mao’s quotations. Often, I talk to myself while looking at Chairman Mao’s portrait: “Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Your kindness to me is something I can never repay in this life. We poor and lower-middle peasants love you the most, with one heart following you. Although I am old, I will still read your books, listen to your words, walk the path you point out, and follow you to revolutionize for life!” I look at Chairman Mao’s portrait every day, and the more I look, the happier I feel, the more I remember the past bitterness, the more I feel the sweetness of today, the more I look, the closer I feel to Chairman Mao, and the more I love to read Chairman Mao’s books.

	I will strive to study and enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought

	Chairman Mao’s books are the truth for us poor people to stand up and make revolution, and the guiding light for revolutionary people. I read Chairman Mao’s books every day, the more I study, the more I love to study, and the brighter my heart becomes. Although I don’t know a single character, I study hard and strive to understand. In the past, when young people studied at night in the team, I also eagerly participated. Since our family set up the Mao Zedong Thought study class, I have not missed a single moment.

	Vice Chairman Lin said: “To truly master Mao Zedong Thought, we must repeatedly study Chairman Mao’s many basic viewpoints. Some quotations should be memorized, repeatedly studied, and repeatedly applied.”

	When I study, my biggest difficulty is that I don’t know characters and my memory is poor. However, I have a heart loyal to Chairman Mao, and no difficulty is too great. I take Old Man Qu as my example, “Determine to struggle, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory.” I study and recite day and night, fearing that I will forget, so I ask others to draw some small pictures to help me remember. Even when cooking, I recite. Sometimes the food is burnt, and I don’t even know. One night, I woke up at midnight and reviewed the two sections of Chairman Mao’s quotations that my granddaughter taught me during the day. I have already memorized “In Memory of Norman Bethune” and many of Chairman Mao’s quotations, and I am now studying and memorizing “Serve the People” and “The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains,” striving to memorize them before July 1st this year to commemorate the Party’s birthday.

	I not only study Mao Zedong Thought with great effort but also do my best to propagate it. I organized the sixty or seventy-year-old sisters in our team to form an “Eight Aunties” propaganda team, asking some young people in the team to teach us to sing songs of Chairman Mao’s quotations and revolutionary songs praising Chairman Mao. We also rehearsed some small performances. Now I can sing more than twenty revolutionary songs, such as “The East Is Red,” “A Ship in the Ocean Relies on the Helmsman,” and “Long Live Chairman Mao!” and often go to our commune, other communes, and the army to propagate and perform. The Liaoning South Special District held a family Mao Zedong Thought study class on-site meeting in our village, and I also performed once in front of more than a thousand people. Someone said that I sing out of tune with my missing teeth, but I said, “I sing from my heart for Chairman Mao!” I also often give speeches to poor and lower-middle peasants recalling bitterness and sweetness. I feel that every time I propagate Mao Zedong Thought, my love for Chairman Mao deepens, and my hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev increases.

	I do as Chairman Mao says

	Vice Chairman Lin said: “Studying Chairman Mao’s works should be done with problems in mind, actively applying what is learned, combining learning with application, learning what is urgently needed first, seeing results immediately, and focusing on the ‘use’ aspect.” I have not studied much of Chairman Mao’s books, but I strive to learn one sentence and apply one sentence, doing as Chairman Mao says.

	In the past, the children all said that at my age, with a large group of grandchildren and great-grandchildren, I should enjoy a few years of happiness and not let me participate in collective labor. After studying Chairman Mao’s works and participating in revolutionary criticism and struggle, I realized that not participating in collective labor, wanting to enjoy a peaceful life, this is not in line with Mao Zedong Thought, it is the “self” at work. “Self” is a bad thing, if it is not eliminated, people will go astray, the country will change color, and we poor people will have to bear the burden and beg for food again, suffering twice. In the family study class, I fiercely fought against this “self.” I decided to listen to Chairman Mao’s words and work for socialism until I am old!

	Last autumn, when we were husking corn, we criticized the “small contract” promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his henchmen and implemented the Dazhai-style work-point system. However, some bad elements secretly spread rumors and stirred up trouble, saying, “This year there is a lot of work, and without a contract, we can husk until the end of the year.” I was so angry when I heard this that I felt this was a struggle between socialism and capitalism, and we must firmly refute the Chinese Khrushchev’s fallacies of “self-management, self-reliance, and self-sufficiency.” I organized the whole family to study Chairman Mao’s teaching, “The enemy will not disappear by itself. Whether it is the reactionaries in China or the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China, they will not withdraw from the stage of history by themselves,” and deeply criticized the Chinese Khrushchev’s black goods of “self-management, self-reliance, and self-sufficiency.” The next day, I discussed with a few old sisters from the “Eight Aunties” propaganda team and took the lead in going to the team to husk corn, using actual actions to criticize the Chinese Khrushchev. We worked under the stars and moonlight, with sore hands and backs, but looking at the courtyard with Chairman Mao’s quotations “Determine to struggle, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory” and Chairman Mao’s portrait, we gained boundless strength. As a result, we finished husking the corn more than ten days earlier than in previous years.

	This spring, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, the proletarian headquarters issued a call to swiftly launch the spring agricultural production high tide, and I immediately led the whole family to actively respond. To achieve a bumper harvest this year, when it was dry, I carried ice and water with the community members during lunch breaks to water fruit trees and wheat. The community members caringly said, you are old, don’t fall and hurt yourself. I said, although I am old, I walk the sunny path of socialism, the more I work, the happier I am. Our family study class also repeatedly discussed the issue of contributing good fertilizer to the collective, and everyone fiercely fought against the past selfishness of not handing over good manure to the collective and keeping it for the private plot. We sent all the good manure from our pigsty to the team. I also went with the old sisters from the “Eight Aunties” propaganda team to pick manure for the team with baskets. If there was no manure nearby, we would run several miles away to pick it. Someone asked us, how many work points does the team give you? We all answered, dedicating our red hearts to Chairman Mao, we don’t want a single work point.

	Educating the next generation to be forever loyal to Chairman Mao

	Children are the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, and what path they take and what they succeed depends on what kind of thought we, the elders, use to educate them. This is a big deal. Through studying Chairman Mao’s works, I feel that educating children with Mao Zedong Thought and making the next generation forever loyal to Chairman Mao is the most important thing.

	To make the children always remember the bitterness of their class, never forget the blood and tears, I often lead the children to recall bitterness and sweetness. Our family not only often recalls bitterness in the study class but also when the children have problems in their thoughts, and even during the most joyful times like New Year’s and Spring Festival, we recall bitterness, so that the children always remember how today’s good life came about, making them imprint a “loyal” character to Chairman Mao in their minds from the moment they start to remember, grow the seeds of the proletarian “public” character, and succeed in the proletarian revolutionary cause in the future. Once, my fourth son wanted to buy a mattress cover, and I thought coarse cloth was sturdy, so I told him to buy coarse cloth to make it, but he said coarse cloth “irritates” the skin and insisted on buying fine cloth. I heard these words and felt like my heart was being pricked. I said to my son, “Child, we must not forget the pain after the wound has healed! In the past, we wore broken sackcloth and carried begging sticks, and now that life is good, we complain about the coarse cloth mattress cover ‘irritating’ the skin. Isn’t this forgetting the past hardships?” A few words made both me and my son cry. After that, he changed his past habit of loving to wear good clothes and not wanting to do dirty work. He is an elementary school teacher, and every day he goes to Huatun to work, carrying a basket to pick manure for the collective, not afraid of dirt or hard work. In the past two years, he has picked more than ten thousand pounds of good manure and handed it all over to the collective.

	Our family has several children who are cadres. My third son is the political squad leader, my eldest daughter-in-law is the women’s squad leader, and my fifth son does security work in the brigade. They are all holding power for the proletariat. Whose hands hold the power, this is too important. I, the old woman, suffered so much in the past, wasn’t it because the power was in the hands of the class enemy? We must hold the power well and educate our children not to disappoint Chairman Mao’s expectations, using Mao Zedong Thought to hold the power for the revolutionary people. In the family study class, I often tell this truth to my sons and daughters-in-law, asking them to work hard, listen to Chairman Mao’s words, and be worthy of Chairman Mao and the revolutionary martyrs who shed blood and sacrificed their lives for us poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary people. I also often use Chairman Mao’s instructions to help them establish the viewpoint of wholeheartedly serving the people. My third son is the political squad leader, and once I heard that the masses had complaints about him, and his spirits were low, so I called him and said, “Chairman Mao told us cadres to go down and walk around, see the situation, listen to the masses’ opinions, and be students of the masses. Why can’t you go to the community members and listen to their reflections? Why can’t you talk to the poor and lower-middle peasants and learn from the masses?” After that, he listened to Chairman Mao’s words, fiercely fought against selfishness, worked and studied with the masses, fought against selfishness and revisionism together, and the masses were very satisfied.

	In more than a year, through studying Chairman Mao’s works, my eyes have brightened, my direction has become clear, and my revolutionary spirit has become stronger. I now feel that Chairman Mao’s great portrait, I can never see enough; my love for Chairman Mao’s words, I can never say enough; Chairman Mao’s revolutionary treasure books, I can never study enough; songs praising Chairman Mao, I can never sing enough; loyal deeds to Chairman Mao, I can never do enough. Ten thousand words condense into one sentence: “Never forget the bitterness of the class, forever loyal to Chairman Mao!”

    俺心中只有毛主席
    活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子、辽宁省金县华家屯公社高家大队贫农社员　丁玉兰
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”在伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，在毛主席“五·七”指示的光辉照耀下，在解放军同志的帮助下，俺家很早就办起了毛泽东思想学习班。我怀着无限忠于毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，学习毛主席的革命宝书，懂得了很多革命的道理。我做梦也没想到，我这个在旧社会讨了几十年饭的老婆子，今天还能学习毛主席著作。我觉得只有读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，不断改造思想，才能人老心红方向明，永远忠于毛主席，时时紧跟毛主席。过去我坐在热炕头上，守着几间房，关心的是自家事，心中只有家里几个人；现在是站在家门口，望着北京城，想着全世界，关心的是国家大事，心中只有俺最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席。
    祝愿毛主席万寿无疆！
    我今年七十五岁了。刚开始办学习班的时候，我寻思自己这么大年纪，快土埋头顶的人了，一个大字不识，能学好吗？后来，我参加了队里颂扬毛主席丰功伟绩的活动，和大家一起忆苦思甜，开展革命大批判，受到了很大教育。我懂得了今天的好日子来得不容易。当我听到毛主席领导全国革命人民经历了多少艰难困苦，才取得了革命的胜利，咱们贫下中农才翻身解放有了今天的幸福生活，心里非常激动。听着，听着，我哭起来了。我想，天大地大不如党的恩情大，毛主席真是咱贫下中农最亲的人。我望着毛主席像，想想过去，看看现在，回忆起许多往事来了。
    万恶的旧社会，活活坑死了我十一个亲人。我十四岁那年，爹爹在给地主扛活时，被狼心狗肺的地主活活打死了。爹爹死后，妈妈领着我们姊妹几个到处要饭。不久，妈妈被生活熬煎得走投无路，也死了。姐姐、妹妹和小弟弟，也死的死，卖的卖。我十六岁嫁给了贫农老赵家。过门后不几年，婆家又饿死和累死了四口人。我生了八个儿子，也活活饿死两个。我要饭从山东要到关东，从不懂事的孩子要到五十多岁。地主的恶狗咬掉了我的右耳朵，咬得我满身是伤，险些送了命。要不是毛主席把俺救出来，我这老婆子还不知死到那里啦！有了毛主席，才有俺丁玉兰，才有咱贫下中农的今天。毛主席啊，毛主席，我要千遍万遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁，万万岁！”千遍万遍祝愿您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    爹娘恩情深，比不上毛主席。我白天黑夜时时想念着毛主席。俺家挂了几十张毛主席像，照得全家亮堂堂。我里屋的四面墙上都挂着毛主席像，坐在炕上四面都能看到。我把外屋也挂上毛主席像，做饭时一抬头就望见毛主席。我一边烧火，一边望着毛主席像背毛主席语录，背“老三篇”，唱毛主席语录歌。常常自言自语地望着毛主席像说：“毛主席啊，毛主席！您老人家的恩情俺一辈子也说不完，道不尽。俺贫下中农最热爱您，一个心眼跟着您。别看俺年纪老，也要读您的书，听您的话，走您指引的路，跟您干一辈子革命！”我天天看毛主席像，越看心里越乐，越看越不忘过去的苦，越看越觉得今天的甜，越看对毛主席越亲，越看越爱读毛主席的书。
    毛泽东思想俺要努力学习，热情宣传
    毛主席的书是咱穷人翻身闹革命的真理，是咱革命人民的指路明灯。我天天读毛主席的书，越学越爱学，越学心里越亮堂。我虽然一个大字不识，可是我下苦功夫学，拚命地钻。以前青年人晚上在队里学，我也争着去参加。自从家里办起了毛泽东思想学习班，我一时一刻也不耽误。
    林副主席说：“为了把毛泽东思想真正学到手，要反复学习毛主席的许多基本观点，有些警句最好要背熟，反复学习，反复运用。”
    我在学习的时候，最大的困难是不识字，记性不好。可是，我有一颗忠于毛主席的心，天大的困难也难不倒。我以老愚公为榜样，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”我一天到晚没有遍数的学呀，背呀，怕忘了，就叫人给画些小图帮助记忆。做饭时我也背，有时饭煮糊了我还不知道。有一天，睡到半夜忽然醒了，我又温习白天孙女教的两段毛主席语录。我已经背会了《为人民服务》和毛主席的很多条语录，现在正在学背《纪念白求恩》和《愚公移山》，争取在今年“七·一”前背会，来纪念党的生日。
    我不但自己下苦功夫学习毛泽东思想，还尽最大努力来宣传毛泽东思想。我把俺队六、七十岁的老姐妹都组织起来，成立一个“八大妈”宣传队，请队里一些年轻人教俺们唱毛主席语录歌和歌颂毛主席的革命歌儿。还排演了一些小节目。现在俺已经会唱《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》和《敬祝毛主席万寿无疆》等二十几首革命歌曲，经常到本公社、外公社和部队去宣传演出。辽南专区在俺村开家庭毛泽东思想学习班现场会，俺在一千多人的大会上也演出了一次。有人说俺掉牙漏风唱得不成调，俺说：“俺唱的是对毛主席的感情！”我还经常给贫下中农作忆苦思甜报告。我觉得每宣传一次毛泽东思想，对毛主席的热爱就加深一层，对中国赫鲁晓夫的仇恨就增加一倍。
    毛主席怎么说，俺就怎么做
    林副主席说：“学习毛主席著作，要带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在‘用’字上狠下功夫。”毛主席的书我学得不多，但努力做到学一句，用一句，毛主席怎么说，俺就怎么做。毛主席有什么指示，俺就照办。
    过去孩子们都说我这么大岁数了，孙儿孙女一大群，该享几年福啦，不让我参加集体劳动。学了毛主席著作，参加了革命大批判，我认识到，不参加集体劳动，想坐享清福，这不符合毛泽东思想，是个“私”字在作怪。“私”字是个坏东西，不斗掉它，人就要走歪道，国家就要变颜色，咱们穷人还得扛活讨饭，重受二遍苦。我在家庭学习班里狠斗了这个“私”字。我下决心听毛主席的话，活到老，为社会主义干到老！
    去年秋天剥包米时，我们批判了中国赫鲁晓夫和他的爪牙推行的“小包工”，实行了大寨式的评工记分。可是，有些坏家伙在背地里煽阴风，点邪火，说什么“今年活多，不包工能剥到腊月腊。”我一听气坏了，觉得这是社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，一定要坚决把中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”的谬论批倒批臭。我就组织全家人带着这个问题，学习毛主席“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台”的教导，深入批判中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”的黑货。第二天，我和俺“八大妈”宣传队几个老姊妹商量，带头到队里剥包米，用实际行动批判中国赫鲁晓夫。我们披星戴月地干，手脖累痛了，腰累酸了，看看场院里贴的毛主席语录“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，再望望毛主席的画像，就增加了无穷的力量。结果，我们比往年提前十多天把包米剥完了。
    今年春天，以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部向我们发出了迅速掀起春季农业生产高潮的号召，我立即带领全家积极响应。为了夺取今年农业大丰收，天旱了，俺就和社员一起利用午休时间抬冰抬水浇果树和小麦。社员们关心地说，你年纪大了，别跌倒摔着。俺说，我年纪虽大，走的是社会主义阳光道，越干越欢。我们家庭学习班还反复讨论了向集体投好肥的问题，大家狠斗了过去好粪不交集体，留着上自留地的私心，把我家猪圈里的好粪都送到队里。我还和“八大妈”宣传队的老姊妹们挎起粪筐为队里拣粪。近的地方拣不着，我们就跑到几里地外去拣。人家问我们，队里给多少工分？我们一齐回答，向毛主席献红心，俺们一分也不要。
    教育子孙后代，永远忠于毛主席
    孩子们是无产阶级革命事业的接班人，他们走什么道，接什么班，当老人的用什么思想来教育他们，这可是件大事。通过学习毛主席著作，我感到用毛泽东思想教育孩子，让子孙后代辈辈永远都忠于毛主席，这是最重要的一条。
    为了使孩子们永远牢记阶级苦，不忘血泪仇，我一有空就领着孩子们忆苦思甜。俺家不但经常在学习班上忆苦，在孩子们思想上有了毛病时忆苦，在过年过节大伙最欢乐的时候也忆苦，让孩子们时时不忘今天的好生活是怎样来的，使他们从刚记事时起，脑袋里就印下对毛主席的一个“忠”字，长出无产阶级“公”字的苗子，将来接好无产阶级革命事业的班。有一次俺四儿子要买褥里子，我寻思粗线布结实，就叫他买粗线布做，可是他说粗线“硌”人，非要买细线的不可。我听了这句话，心里象针刺的那样难受。对儿子说：“孩子，咱可不能好了疮疤忘了痛啊！俺们过去是披破麻袋片，撑要饭棍子的，现在生活好了，就嫌粗线褥里‘硌’人了，你这不是忘了过去的艰苦吗？”几句话把我和儿子都说哭了。打这以后，他改变了过去爱穿好的，不爱干脏活的毛病。他是小学教师，每天到华屯上班，都挎着粪筐为集体拣粪，不嫌脏，不怕累，两年来，他共拣了一万多斤好粪，都交给了集体。
    俺家有好几个儿女当干部。三儿子是小队政治队长，大儿媳妇是妇女队长，五儿子在大队作治保工作，他们都是为无产阶级掌权。政权掌握在谁的手里，这可太重要了，我老婆子过去受那么多的苦，不就因为政权掌握在阶级敌人手里吗？我们要掌好印把子，就得教育子女不辜负毛主席的期望，用毛泽东思想为革命人民掌好权。我在家庭学习班里常常给儿子媳妇们讲这个道理，要他们好好工作，听毛主席的话，要对得起毛主席，对得起为俺贫下中农和革命人民流血牺牲的革命先烈。我还常常用毛主席的指示帮助他们树立全心全意为人民服务的观点。我三儿子是政治队长，有一次我听说群众对他有意见，他情绪不高，就把他找来，对他说：“毛主席叫我们当干部的下去走一走，看一看，听群众意见，做群众小学生。你为什么就不能到社员中去听一听群众的反映？为什么就不能和贫下中农谈谈心，向群众学习呢？”打那往后，他听了毛主席的话，狠斗了私心，和群众在一起劳动，一起学习，一起斗私批修，群众很满意。
    一年多来，通过学习毛主席著作，俺眼睛亮了，方向明了，革命劲头更足了。我现在觉得，伟大领袖毛主席的像，我就是看不够；热爱毛主席的话，我就是说不够；毛主席的革命宝书，我就是学不够；颂扬毛主席的歌，我就是唱不够；忠于毛主席的事，我就是做不够。千言万语汇成一句话：“不忘阶级苦，永远忠于毛主席！”
