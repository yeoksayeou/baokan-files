Hou Hongtao is a student in the third year of Beijing No. 70 Middle School. As soon as the news that the school had approved her to go to Northeast China to participate in agricultural production was announced, she hurried back home to tell her mother and father the good news.

As soon as Hongtao got home, her father patted her shoulder and praised her, saying, "Child! You listen to Chairman Mao's words and walk the path of integrating with workers and peasants. Father supports you a thousand times!" However, Hongtao noticed that her mother's face had changed. After dinner, Hongtao quietly told her father, "Mother's thoughts have gone astray!"

Father said, "We can't let Mother fall behind. Let's hold a self-criticism and criticism meeting. Mother, who grew up in hardship, will listen to Chairman Mao's words."

Under the bright light, the family sat in front of Chairman Mao's portrait. Father led the family in reading Chairman Mao's instructions on the direction of the youth movement. Hongtao then said, "Chairman Mao teaches us, 'All intellectuals who can go to the countryside to work should go there with pleasure. The countryside is a vast world where one can do great things.' I listen to Chairman Mao's words and go to the countryside. Why isn't Mother happy?"

Hongtao immediately brought up the issue. Mother, looking uncomfortable, said, "The countryside is a place to temper oneself. I understand that. But you didn't consider that I am not in good health. Hongtao is the eldest daughter. If she leaves, who will take care of the family? As soon as Mother finished speaking, Father said, "You say the countryside is a good place, and that's right. You are a daughter of a poor peasant. In the old society, when your father died, our family of six had only four acres of land. Who took care of you then? After liberation, everything we wear and eat, which of these weren't created by Chairman Mao leading the working people? It is Chairman Mao and the working people who have supported our entire family and children. Now that the children have grown up, you don't want to let her walk the path of integrating with workers and peasants. This is fair to whom? The child listens to Chairman Mao's words and goes to participate in agricultural production. This shows that the child has ambition. As parents, we should be happy. You bring up this difficulty and that problem, this is putting 'self' first, forgetting one's roots. I say you have fallen behind recently!"

Father's words were heavy with meaning. As soon as he mentioned the hardships of the old society, Mother's eyes welled up with tears. She said, "What my husband says is all reasonable. In the old society, I suffered under the landlord's oppression, and he suffered under the capitalist's exploitation. Without Chairman Mao, there would be no us. Chairman Mao's kindness can never be forgotten." Then, Mother turned to Hongtao and said, "Mother was wrong! You are walking the bright path that Chairman Mao has pointed out. I will not obstruct you."

Hearing Mother's words, Hongtao jumped up happily and said, "Mom! You've caught up. You haven't fallen behind!"

    妈妈思想通了
    侯宏陶是北京七十中初三的学生。学校批准她到东北参加农业生产的消息刚一传出，她就迫不及待地赶回家去，一心要把这最好的消息赶快告诉妈妈和爸爸。
    宏陶一到家，爸爸拍着她的肩膀夸奖说：“孩子！你听毛主席的话，走与工农相结合的道路，爸爸一千个支持你！”可是，这时宏陶发现妈妈的脸色变样了。晚饭以后，宏陶悄悄地对爸爸说：“妈妈思想出岔子啦！ ”爸爸说：
  “不能让妈妈掉队。我们开个斗私批修会，在苦水里泡大的妈妈是会听毛主席的话的。”
    明亮的灯光下，一家人坐在毛主席像前。爸爸首先带着全家朗读了毛主席有关青年运动方向的语录。宏陶接着说：毛主席教导我们说：“一切可以到农村中去工作的这样的知识分子，应当高兴地到那里去。农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的。”我听毛主席的话，到农村去，妈妈为什么不高兴呢？宏陶一下就把问题亮开了。妈妈很不自然地说：农村是锻炼人的地方，这个我明白。但是你们也没有考虑考虑我身体不好，宏陶是姐妹中最大的一个，她走了，家里困难，谁照顾？妈妈话音刚落，爸爸就说：你说农村是个好地方，这就说对了。你是贫农女儿，在旧社会，你父亲死时，全家六口人，只有四亩地，那时谁照顾你？解放后这些年里，我们穿的、吃的，那一桩不是毛主席领导劳动人民创造出来的？是毛主席和劳动人民养活了我们全家和孩子，现在孩子长大了，你却不愿意让她走同工农相结合的道路，这对得起谁？孩子听毛主席的话，去参加农业生产，这说明孩子有志气，做父母的应该高兴。你提出这个困难，摆出那个问题，这就是“私”字当头，忘了本，我说最近你掉队了！
    爸爸这一席话语重心长。一提起旧社会的苦，妈妈眼里直闪泪花。她说：
  “你爸爸说的句句都在道理上，在旧社会我受地主的压迫，他受资本家的剥削，没有毛主席就没有我们一家。毛主席的恩情永远不能忘。”接着，妈妈又对宏陶说：“妈妈错了！你走的是毛主席指出的光明大道，我决不阻挡你。”
    听了妈妈的话，宏陶高兴地跳了起来说：“妈！您跟上来了，您没有掉队！”新兵
