Workers of the Beijing New China Printing Factory, with the assistance of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support personnel, have prioritized class struggle and used Mao Zedong Thought to educate their children. The spiritual outlook of the youngsters has undergone significant changes.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 29th, the People's Liberation Army personnel stationed at the Beijing New China Printing Factory, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions on cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, have mobilized revolutionary workers to prioritize class struggle and use the great Mao Zedong Thought to educate the children of workers. This has led to significant changes in the spiritual outlook of the workers' children.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The question of cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause is a matter of life and death for our Party and our country. It is a great matter of concern to the proletarian revolutionary cause, a matter of concern for a hundred, a thousand, and ten thousand years." The revolutionary workers of this factory, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support personnel, have gradually come to realize that the field of educating workers' children must be occupied by socialism; otherwise, capitalism will inevitably occupy it. The revolutionary proletariat must, with a high sense of revolutionary responsibility, clear out all the influences and poisons of the class enemy on this field and firmly plant the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought.

Based on this understanding, the People's Liberation Army personnel stationed at the New China Printing Factory and the broad revolutionary workers have always placed the organization of children's active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works in the most important position, as the fundamental task to be firmly grasped. They have organized more than 20 extracurricular Mao Zedong Thought study classes in various residential areas for the children of workers, helping the children establish a system for studying Mao Zedong Thought, encouraging them to summarize their learning experiences at any time, and sharing their insights on actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought in struggle sessions against selfishness and revisionism. Some workers also hold family struggle sessions against selfishness and revisionism and organize family Mao Zedong Thought study classes with their children. They also pay attention to using Mao Zedong Thought to praise, criticize, and answer or explain various questions raised by the children in daily life. In this way, they cultivate the habit of actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the children from all aspects, encouraging them to consciously use Mao Zedong Thought to observe things, judge right and wrong, and strictly demand of themselves.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "Many young people, due to their lack of political experience and social life experience, are not good at comparing old China and new China, and do not easily deeply understand how our people have gone through countless hard struggles to get rid of the oppression of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries and how much long-term hard work is needed to build a beautiful socialist society." Based on Chairman Mao's instructions, this factory, in organizing workers' children to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, pays special attention to class education. In addition to organizing old workers who suffered greatly in the old society to give "bitter-sweet" reports to the children and organizing the children to eat "bitter-sweet" meals, they also widely mobilize revolutionary workers to use holidays, vacations, and after-work rest time to reminisce about the hardships suffered in the old society among the children, to talk about the sweetness of the new society, to praise the great leader Chairman Mao's brilliance, greatness, and correctness, and to criticize the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev in attempting to restore capitalism. Through class education, the class struggle awareness and two-line struggle consciousness of the workers' children have been enhanced, and they have actively participated in the revolutionary criticism and struggle against a handful of capitalist roaders within the factory.

Over the past two months, through the joint efforts of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support personnel and the revolutionary workers, the spiritual outlook of the workers' children at the Beijing New China Printing Factory has undergone significant changes. They use the great Mao Zedong Thought to observe and analyze the people and events around them, discover the sabotage activities and suspicious movements of the class enemy, and immediately expose or report them to the People's Liberation Army's leftist support personnel, supervising bad elements and exposing and pursuing bad deeds. As their class struggle awareness and two-line struggle consciousness continue to improve, the children gradually learn to use the great Mao Zedong Thought to guide their thoughts and actions. Even some of the more mischievous children in the past have now become members of the workers' children's Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, and some have even become little tutors helping their parents and mothers study Chairman Mao's works. One child, who used to take public bricks to build a chicken coop at home, recently studied Chairman Mao's teaching on having "no selfishness and no gain" and realized that taking public bricks was poisoned by China's Khrushchev's "fusion of public and private" theory. He then organized some children who also took public bricks to return the bricks to their original place. When the children do this, they always happily recite Chairman Mao's great teachings: "Our army is completely for the liberation of the people and is thoroughly working for the people's interests."

    把孩子培养成为无限忠于毛主席的革命接班人
    北京新华印刷厂革命职工，在解放军支左人员帮助下，以阶级斗争为纲，用毛泽东思想教育子女，少年儿童的精神面貌发生很大变化
    据新华社二十九日讯　人民解放军驻北京新华印刷厂支左人员，遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的光辉指示，发动广大革命职工以阶级斗争为纲，用伟大的毛泽东思想对职工子女进行教育，使职工子女的精神面貌发生了很大变化。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的问题，“这是关系我们党和国家命运的生死存亡的极其重大的问题。这是无产阶级革命事业的百年大计，千年大计，万年大计。”这个厂的革命职工在人民解放军支左人员的帮助下逐步认识到，职工子女教育这个阵地，社会主义如果不去占领，资本主义就必然会去占领。无产阶级革命派必须以高度的革命责任感，在这个阵地上清除阶级敌人的一切影响和流毒，牢牢地插上毛泽东思想的伟大红旗。
    根据这样的认识，驻新华印刷厂人民解放军支左人员和广大革命职工，始终把组织孩子们活学活用毛主席著作放在最重要的地位，当作根本来狠抓。他们在各个家属区分别组织了二十多个职工子女的课外毛泽东思想学习班，帮助孩子们普遍建立起学习毛泽东思想的制度，启发孩子们随时总结学习毛泽东思想的收获，在斗私批修会上介绍活学活用毛泽东思想的心得体会。还有些职工和自己的孩子一起召开家庭斗私批修会和举办家庭毛泽东思想学习班，并且在日常生活中注意运用毛泽东思想对孩子进行表扬、批评，用毛主席语录回答、解释孩子们提出来的各种问题。这样，从各个方面培养孩子们活学活用毛泽东思想的习惯，促使孩子们自觉地用毛泽东思想来观察事物、判断是非，严格地要求自己。
    毛主席指出：“不少青年人由于缺少政治经验和社会生活经验，不善于把旧中国和新中国加以比较，不容易深切了解我国人民曾经怎样经历千辛万苦的斗争才摆脱了帝国主义和国民党反动派的压迫，而建立一个美好的社会主义社会要经过怎样的长时间的艰苦劳动。”根据毛主席的指示，这个厂在组织职工子女活学活用毛主席著作中，非常注意进行阶级教育。他们除了专门组织在旧社会苦大仇深的老工人给孩子们作忆苦思甜的报告，组织孩子们吃忆苦饭以外，还广泛发动革命职工利用节日、假日和下班休息时间，在孩子中间大忆在旧社会受压迫的苦，大谈新社会的甜，大颂伟大领袖毛主席的英明、伟大和正确，大批中国赫鲁晓夫妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。通过阶级教育，提高了职工子女的阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争觉悟，使他们积极参加了革命大批判和斗争厂内一小撮走资派的活动。
    两个多月来，在人民解放军支左人员和革命职工的共同努力下，北京新华印刷厂职工子女的精神面貌发生了很大变化。他们用伟大的毛泽东思想去观察、分析周围的人和事，发现阶级敌人的破坏活动和可疑行踪，就立即进行揭发或向人民解放军支左人员报告，监督坏人，揭发、追究坏事。随着阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争觉悟的不断提高，孩子们逐渐学会用伟大的毛泽东思想来指导自己的思想和行动。就连过去一些比较调皮的孩子，现在也成了职工子女毛泽东思想宣传队的队员，有的还当上了帮助爸爸、妈妈学习毛主席著作的小辅导员。有个孩子，过去把公家的砖头搬到自己家里垒鸡窝。不久前，他学习了毛主席“毫无自私自利之心的精神”的教导，认识到拿公家的砖头，这是中了中国赫鲁晓夫“公私溶化”论的毒，就串连一些也拿了公家砖头的孩子，一起把砖头送回了原处。孩子们在这样做的时候，总是高高兴兴地背诵毛主席的伟大教导：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”
