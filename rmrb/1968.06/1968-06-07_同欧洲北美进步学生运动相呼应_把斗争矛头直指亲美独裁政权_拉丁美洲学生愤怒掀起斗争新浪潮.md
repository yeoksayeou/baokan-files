Students in Latin America, who have long suffered under the oppression of American imperialism and its lackeys, have once again launched a new wave of struggle. They are fighting against reactionary educational measures that shackle and suppress them. In some countries, students have directly aimed their struggle at pro-American dictatorial regimes. This struggle resonates with the surging progressive student movements in Western Europe and North America and is continuing to develop.

Since last December, Brazilian students, who have been continuously fighting against American imperialist cultural aggression and the educational policies of pro-American dictatorial regimes, launched a new struggle on June 5. Over fifteen thousand university students participated in a general strike.

In Chile, university students have been on strike to demand reforms to the corrupt educational system and to protest the persecution of progressive teachers by school authorities. This strike has spread to important northern cities such as Antofagasta and the major port city of Valparaíso, involving over thirty thousand university students. On May 31, progressive teachers at the University of Chile held a meeting to support the striking university students and strongly condemned the reactionary school authorities and revisionist elements for their evil deeds in disrupting the student movement.

Since early May, university students in the Argentine capital of Buenos Aires have been continuously holding demonstrations to protest the reactionary measures of the Onganía pro-American dictatorial regime, which restrict students' freedom of speech, assembly, and limit the enrollment of poor youth. On May 29, hundreds of students held a demonstration in the city center against the pro-American dictatorial government. The next day, seven hundred students held a meeting, demanding reforms to the reactionary educational system. They defended their classrooms against the unreasonable interference of reactionary police who entered the school. At the beginning of June, more departments and faculties were planning to hold protests and strikes, with university students declaring themselves to be in a state of mobilization.

On the evening of May 29, Bolivian students, together with workers, held a meeting in the capital La Paz, demanding the resignation of the pro-American dictator Barrientos and an increase in teachers' salaries. In Santa Cruz, students held a meeting and demonstration against the pro-American dictatorship on May 30. The demonstrating students occupied the university and built barricades with school equipment to counter the armed suppression by reactionary police.

On May 26, when Barrientos arrived in Sucre, Chuquisaca Province, students shouted at him, "Death to the gorillas (extreme reactionary pro-American military personnel)!"

At the end of May, students at the Normal School in Uruguay occupied their school, demanding the issuance of scholarships. Many high school students also held demonstrations to protest measures that lowered students' living conditions.

In Peru, students at the University of Ica also occupied their school, demanding the removal of the reactionary principal who had long suppressed them.
