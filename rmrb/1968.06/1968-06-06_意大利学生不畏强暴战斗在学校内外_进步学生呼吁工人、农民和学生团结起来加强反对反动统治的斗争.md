Italian students continue their struggle against the reactionary rule of the monopolistic bourgeoisie and the decaying educational system. In recent days, students have continued to occupy schools and engage in fierce battles with reactionary police.

Several thousand progressive students at the University of Rome have been occupying the school since May 31st. They have raised red flags within the campus, turning the school into a bastion against the reactionaries. They have repelled multiple attacks by a small group of right-wing students instigated by the reactionary authorities. On June 3rd, after repelling an attack by a small group of right-wing students, the reactionary authorities ruthlessly deployed 1,500 police officers to brutally suppress the students and forcibly seized the university. Progressive students bravely fought back against the police. Dozens of students were arbitrarily arrested by the police. However, the progressive students continued their struggle outside the campus. In their distributed manifesto, they called on the workers, peasants, and students of Italy to unite and strengthen the struggle against reactionary rule.

Students occupying the administrative building at the University of Turin also engaged in fierce battles on the 3rd with hooligan students instigated by the reactionary authorities to tear down posters, remove red flags, and disrupt the student movement.

Students at the University of Milan, defying the reactionary authorities' ban, continued to occupy the school on the 3rd and bravely resisted the police's violence. The students' struggle received support from the teachers. On that day, some professors issued statements expressing their support for the students' rebellious actions of occupying the school.

In cities such as Naples, Palermo, and Lanciano, workers, inspired by the students' rebellious spirit, held strikes and demonstrations. In Lanciano, workers from a factory threw stones and bricks, smashing the windows of the city hall and engaging in fierce battles with the police.
