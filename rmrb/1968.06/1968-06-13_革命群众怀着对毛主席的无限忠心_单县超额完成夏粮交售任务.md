The revolutionary masses of Shandong's Shancounty, with unlimited loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, have enthusiastically turned in their public grain and surplus grain after securing a good harvest of wheat this year. By June 6, they had turned in 7.54 million jin of wheat, exceeding the county's summer grain procurement target by 840,000 jin.

Under the great banner of Chairman Mao's "Seize the revolution, promote production," the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in this county have displayed a revolutionary spirit of fighting against heaven and earth. Despite relatively severe drought conditions, they have achieved a good harvest of wheat, with a yield per unit area and total yield increasing by 12.3% and 6.8% respectively compared to last year. This is a victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a fruit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, filled with joy and confidence, have expressed their determination to turn in more wheat to make greater contributions to the socialist revolution and socialist construction of the country.

The county's various levels of revolutionary committees and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle." In the grain procurement work, they have vigorously carried out class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. They have taken the initiative to launch a fierce attack on class enemies, striking down various plots by class enemies to sabotage grain procurement work. They have also, in conjunction with the distribution of summer grain, severely criticized Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Shandong for their revisionist black goods in grain work. They have, in accordance with Chairman Mao's great teachings, correctly handled the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual, thereby ensuring the timely and successful completion of the summer grain procurement task.

The county's various levels of revolutionary committees have, in the summer grain procurement and distribution work, organized various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Through these classes, they have seriously studied and implemented Chairman Mao's series of instructions on grain procurement and distribution work, and have seriously studied and widely propagated the glorious deeds of Comrade Duanmu. The broad masses of commune members and cadres have taken Comrade Duanmu as their example, struggled against selfishness and criticized revisionism, firmly established their loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, and resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, swiftly launching a wave of enthusiastically turning in grain to the state.

    单县超额完成夏粮交售任务
    新华社济南十二日电　山东单县广大革命群众怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠心，在夺得今年小麦好收成之后，立即踊跃交公粮，卖余粮。到本月六日为止，他们已交售麦粮七百五十四万斤，超额八十四万多斤完成了全县夏粮征购任务。
    在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针指引下，这个县的广大贫下中农发扬战天斗地的革命精神，使全县六十六万多亩小麦在干旱比较严重的情况下，获得了较好收成，单产、总产分别比去年增长百分之十二点三和百分之六点八。这是毛泽东思想的胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的成果。广大贫下中农怀着喜悦的信心表示，一定要多交售小麦，为国家的社会主义革命和社会主义建设作出更大贡献。
    这个县的各级革命委员会和广大贫下中农，牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，在粮食征购工作中狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争。他们主动地向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，狠狠打击了阶级敌人破坏粮食征购工作的种种阴谋活动。他们还结合夏粮分配，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在山东代理人在粮食工作中推行的修正主义黑货。他们遵照毛主席的伟大教导，正确地处理了国家、集体和个人三者之间的关系，从而保证又快又好地超额完成了夏粮征购任务。
    这个县各级革命委员会在夏粮征购和分配工作中，举办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。通过学习班，认真学习和落实了毛主席关于粮食征购和分配工作的一系列指示，认真学习和广泛宣传了门合同志的光辉事迹。广大社员和干部以门合同志为榜样，斗私批修，大树对伟大领袖毛主席的一个“忠”字，坚决贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，迅速掀起了向国家踊跃交售粮食的热潮。
