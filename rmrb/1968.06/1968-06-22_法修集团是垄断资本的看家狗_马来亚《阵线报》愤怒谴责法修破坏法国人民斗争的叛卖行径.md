The Malayan newspaper *Frontline* published in Singapore issued a commentary on the 16th, strongly condemning the treacherous actions of the French revisionist leadership clique in betraying the interests of the French people and acting as the running dogs of the French monopoly bourgeoisie.

The commentary said, at a time when the great storm of the French revolutionary mass movement was sweeping the country, the French Communist Party (PCF) came out to sabotage the unity of the revolutionary masses and prevent the masses from directing their struggle against the capitalist system. The treacherous plots of the PCF received the support of the Soviet revisionist leadership clique.

The commentary pointed out that the French revolutionary people, through their struggles, have seen more clearly the true face of the PCF. Despite the suppression by the French ruling class and the sabotage by the PCF, they have repeatedly foiled the counter-revolutionary plots played by these forces.

The commentary said, the French workers and students, with the glorious revolutionary tradition of the Paris Commune, have closely coordinated and persisted in their struggles. They stood shoulder to shoulder and fought bravely against the reactionary police and military sent to suppress them. The French workers, students, and other strata of people have taken violent retaliatory actions against the savage suppression by the French ruling class. This great new storm of the revolutionary masses marks the new awakening of the French people.

The commentary pointed out that Chairman Mao taught us: "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with people's will." The French people, the French workers, have long suffered from the cruel oppression and exploitation of the bourgeoisie. Recently, they have risen up to fight and have launched a fierce struggle against the rule of the monopoly bourgeoisie.

It can be foreseen that the people of the world will, through revolutionary struggles, consign the capitalist system to the museum of history. All imperialists and the reactionaries they support in various countries will inevitably be buried by the people's revolution.

    法修集团是垄断资本的看家狗
    马来亚《阵线报》愤怒谴责法修破坏法国人民斗争的叛卖行径
    新华社二十一日讯 新加坡消息：在新加坡出版的马来亚报纸《阵线报》十六日发表社论，强烈谴责法国修正主义领导集团叛卖法国人民利益，充当法国垄断资产阶级的走狗的罪恶行径。
    社论说，正当法国革命群众运动的伟大风暴席卷全国的时候，法修跳出来破坏革命群众的团结，阻止群众把斗争矛头指向资本主义制度。法修的叛卖阴谋活动，获得了苏修领导集团的支持。
    社论指出，法国革命人民在斗争中更清楚地看到了法修的真面目。他们不顾法国统治集团的镇压和法修的破坏，一次又一次地粉碎了它们所玩弄的反革命阴谋。
    社论说，具有巴黎公社光荣革命传统的法国工人和学生，在斗争中紧密配合，坚持斗争。他们肩并肩地同前来镇压的反动军警展开了英勇搏斗。法国工人、学生和其他各阶层人民，对于法国统治集团的野蛮镇压，采取了暴力的还击。这场革命群众的伟大新风暴标志着法国人民的新觉醒。
    社论指出，毛主席教导我们说：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。”法国人民、法国工人，长期以来受着资产阶级残酷的压迫和剥削。最近，他们奋起斗争，大造垄断资产阶级统治的反。
    可以肯定，全世界人民通过革命斗争，必将把资本主义制度送进历史博物馆。一切帝国主义和它们扶植的各国反动派，也必然要被人民的革命所埋葬。
