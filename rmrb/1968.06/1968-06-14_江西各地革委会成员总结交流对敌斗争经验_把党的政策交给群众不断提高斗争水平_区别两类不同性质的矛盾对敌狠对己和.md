The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a political revolution under the conditions of socialism, a revolution by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and its leadership of the broad masses of revolutionary people and the reactionary Kuomintang, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Delegates attending the first Jiangxi Provincial Conference of Active Learners and Appliers of Mao Zedong Thought exchanged experiences on how revolutionary committees have focused on class struggle, leading the broad masses of revolutionary people to steadily, accurately, and fiercely strike at a handful of class enemies. Everyone expressed their determination to further implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, lead the broad masses of revolutionary people to advance victoriously, and carry the current political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes through to the end.

	Release the masses, stand at the forefront of the struggle, and lead the masses to attack the class enemy

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolutionary war is the war of the masses; it can be waged only by mobilizing the masses and relying on them." Everyone, based on their own experiences, unanimously agreed that revolutionary committees must firmly believe in the masses, rely on the masses, stand at the forefront of the struggle, and lead the masses to launch a fierce attack on the class enemy. Only in this way can all hidden class enemies be exposed.

The comrades from Jiangxi Provincial Metallurgical Bureau emphasized their experiences in this regard. They said: Our "three-in-one" power organ was established not long ago, and revolutionary masses immediately took action, exposing class enemies who had infiltrated the ranks of the proletarian revolutionary ranks. At the beginning, our leading cadre's thoughts did not keep up with the situation, and due to lack of experience, we were afraid of "chaos," so we set some rules and regulations, restricting the masses' hands and feet. Later, we studied Chairman Mao's teachings, checked our thoughts against them, and realized that in this sharp class struggle, we must unwaveringly believe in and rely on the masses. We must not stand behind the masses giving orders, nor stand against the masses opposing them, but must stand at the forefront of the struggle, actively leading the masses to attack the class enemy. Therefore, we immediately went to various departments to further mobilize the masses and fight alongside them. This way, the mass movement of struggle against the enemy was once again launched with great momentum.

	While fighting alongside the masses, we both acted as fighters and commanders, ensuring that the revolutionary mass movement developed victoriously in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao. We and the masses together conducted thorough investigations and research, helping the masses master and apply the method of class analysis, expose the counter-revolutionary faces and strategies of class enemies, and fight against the enemy head-on. In this way, we led the masses to expose traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries who had hidden for many years and dug deep, steadily, accurately, and fiercely striking at a handful of class enemies, purifying our class ranks, further consolidating the new proletarian revolutionary power, promoting revolutionary unity, and advancing the revolution and work.

	Insist on guiding the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, giving the policy to the masses, and continuously improving the level of struggle

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "Before every action, we must explain to the Party members and the masses the policy we have formulated according to the situation." Delegates attending the first Jiangxi Provincial Conference of Active Learners and Appliers of Mao Zedong Thought deeply felt that when mobilizing the masses to struggle against a handful of class enemies, we must directly give the masses Chairman Mao's policies on struggle against the enemy from the beginning. Once the masses grasp the policy, they will have a clear direction, firm resolve, and many methods, fully unleashing their subjective initiative to steadily, accurately, and fiercely strike at a handful of class enemies.

The comrades from Jiangxi Provincial Water and Electricity Design Institute Revolutionary Committee shared their experiences in this regard. They said: We members of the revolutionary committee, following Chairman Mao's teachings, insisted on using the Party's policies to mobilize and arm the masses in the struggle against the enemy, thus ensuring that the revolutionary mass movement continued to develop victoriously and achieved major victories in the struggle against the enemy.

	During the process of mobilizing the masses to launch a struggle against the enemy, we always paid attention to organizing the masses to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works and latest instructions, learning the policies and strategies of struggle against the enemy. Chairman Mao pointed out: Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of the revolution and also the primary question of the Cultural Revolution. We organized the masses to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's great teachings and directly gave the relevant specific policies to the masses, actively guiding the masses to use the method of class analysis to distinguish between enemies and ourselves, directing the struggle spearhead firmly at a handful of class enemies, and continuously improving the level of struggle against the enemy. The broad masses of revolutionary people fiercely exposed, criticized, and struggled against class enemies without mercy or leniency. At the same time, we also paid attention to implementing the policy of "leniency to those who confess, severity to those who resist," treating the handful of class enemies who were exposed differently according to different situations. In this way, it was beneficial to split and disintegrate the enemy, isolating and striking at the extremely small number of stubborn class enemies to the greatest extent. At the same time, through fierce exposure and criticism, the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad masses of revolutionary people was further heightened.

	Unite all who can be united, forming a vast revolutionary army

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "Our army has always had two policies: first, be ruthless to the enemy, suppress it, annihilate it; second, be united with our own people, the people, comrades, superiors, and subordinates." Delegates attending the first Jiangxi Provincial Conference of Active Learners and Appliers of Mao Zedong Thought, based on their personal experiences, pointed out that under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, a handful of class enemies often hide themselves, deceiving or using some people to achieve their purposes of sabotage and destruction, even causing some people in our ranks to make mistakes, even serious mistakes. Everyone believed that guiding the masses to correctly handle two different types of contradictions according to Chairman Mao's teachings, distinguishing between those who have been deceived and made mistakes and a handful of class enemies, educating, winning over, and uniting them, mobilizing all possible positive factors, is a very important issue to ensure the steady, accurate, and fierce strike at a handful of class enemies and achieve victory in the struggle against the enemy.

The comrades from Pingxiang Mining Bureau Revolutionary Committee shared their experiences in this regard. They said: For those who made serious mistakes, we insisted on strict requirements, educating, winning over, and uniting them through criticism and struggle. We explained the policy to them, did political and ideological work, and used Chairman Mao's teachings on "those who make mistakes should be required to correct them, the quicker and more thorough the correction, the better" to educate them, requiring them to sincerely confess and examine their mistakes and issues, drawing a clear line with a handful of class enemies, and gaining the understanding of the masses. For comrades who made general mistakes, we guided the masses to help them actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, through criticizing and repudiating revisionism, participating in the great criticism, recognizing and correcting their mistakes.

	As a result, some who made mistakes or serious mistakes confessed and examined their mistakes, thus uniting the majority and further isolating a handful of class enemies. Many who had made mistakes angrily exposed the crimes of class enemies at struggle meetings against the enemy, and some even exposed the class enemies who had instructed them to do evil deeds on the spot.

	Our Pingxiang Mining Bureau, by insisting on uniting all who can be united and mobilizing all possible positive factors, formed a vast revolutionary army. Not only did we achieve major victories in the struggle against the enemy, but we also won a great battle in production struggle. The coal production of the entire mine has increased significantly in the past few months, with each month surpassing the previous one. On May 22, we also created the historical record of the entire mine's daily coal production exceeding ten thousand tons.

    江西各地革委会成员总结交流对敌斗争经验
    把党的政策交给群众不断提高斗争水平
    区别两类不同性质的矛盾对敌狠对己和
    新华社南昌十三日电  伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”出席江西省首次活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会的各地革命委员会成员，在会议期间结合自己的斗争实践，认真学习了毛主席的最新指示，总结和交流了革命委员会狠抓阶级斗争，带领广大革命群众稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人的经验。大家表示，决心进一步落实毛主席的最新指示，领导广大革命群众乘胜前进，把当前这场无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命进行到底。
    放手发动群众，站在斗争最前线，带领群众向阶级敌人进攻
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”大家结合自己的体会，一致认为革命委员会狠抓阶级斗争，必须坚定地相信群众，依靠群众，站在斗争的最前线，带领群众主动地向阶级敌人展开猛烈进攻。这样，才能把隐藏的一切阶级敌人挖出来。
    江西省冶金厅的同志着重介绍了这方面的体会。他说：我们厅的“三结合”权力机构建立不久，革命群众就纷纷行动起来，揭发混进无产阶级革命队伍里的阶级敌人。开始时，我们领导班子的思想跟不上形势，加上没有经验，怕“乱”，便规定了一些清规戒律，束缚了群众的手脚。后来，我们学习了毛主席的教导，对照检查了自己的思想，认识到在这场尖锐的阶级斗争中，我们必须坚定不移地相信群众、依靠群众，既不能站在群众的后头指手划脚，更不能站在群众的对面反对他们，而是要站到斗争的第一线上去，积极带领群众向阶级敌人进攻。于是，我们立即分头下到各科室，进一步发动群众，同群众一起战斗。这一来，对敌斗争的群众运动又轰轰烈烈地开展起来了。
    在和群众一起进行战斗的时候，我们既当战斗员，又当指挥员，使革命群众运动朝着毛主席指引的方向胜利发展。我们和群众一起，认真进行细致的调查研究，帮助群众掌握和运用阶级分析的方法，识破阶级敌人的反革命面目和反革命策略，针锋相对地和敌人作斗争。就是这样，我们带领群众把隐藏多年、钻得很深的叛徒、特务和反革命分子挖了出来，稳、准、狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人，纯洁了自己的阶级队伍，进一步巩固了新生的无产阶级革命政权，促进了革命大联合，推动了革命和工作。
    坚持用毛泽东思想引导群众，把政策交给群众，不断提高斗争水平
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“在每一行动之前，必须向党员和群众讲明我们按情况规定的政策。”出席江西省首次活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会的各地革命委员会成员，深有体会地说，在发动群众向一小撮阶级敌人进行斗争的时候，必须把毛主席历来关于对敌斗争的方针政策直接交给群众，群众一经掌握了政策，就方向明、决心大、办法多，就能充分发挥主观能动性，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人。
    江西省水电设计院革命委员会的同志介绍了这方面的体会。他说：我们革命委员会成员遵照毛主席的教导，在对敌斗争中坚持用党的政策发动群众、武装群众，因而保证了革命群众运动一直胜利发展，夺得了对敌斗争的重大胜利。
    我们在发动群众开展对敌斗争过程中，一直注意组织群众活学活用毛主席著作和最新指示，学习对敌斗争的政策和策略。毛主席指出：谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题，也是文化大革命的首要问题。我们组织群众反复地学习了毛主席的这一伟大教导，并把有关的具体政策直接交给群众，积极引导群众运用阶级分析的方法，分清敌我，把斗争矛头紧紧对准一小撮阶级敌人，对敌斗争水平不断提高。广大革命群众对于阶级敌人狠揭狠批狠斗，决不留情，决不手软。同时也注意贯彻“坦白从宽，抗拒从严”的政策，对揪出来的一小撮阶级敌人，按照不同情况，区别对待。这样做的结果，既有利于分化瓦解敌人，最大限度地孤立和打击极少数顽固不化的阶级敌人，同时，通过狠揭狠批，也进一步提高了广大革命群众的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。
    团结一切可以团结的人，组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“我们的军队一向就有两条方针：第一对敌人要狠，要压倒它，要消灭它；第二对自己人、对人民、对同志、对官长、对部下要和，要团结。”出席江西省首次活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会的各地革命委员会成员，以自己的亲身体验指出，在无产阶级专政条件下，一小撮阶级敌人往往将自己隐蔽着，蒙蔽或利用一些人去达到他们捣乱破坏的目的，以至使我们队伍中的一些人犯了错误、甚至严重的错误。大家认为，引导群众按照毛主席的教导，正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾，把受蒙蔽犯了错误的人和一小撮阶级敌人区别开来，教育、争取、团结他们，调动一切可以调动的积极因素，这是保证稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，夺取对敌斗争胜利的一个十分重要的问题。
    萍乡矿务局革命委员会成员在介绍这方面的体会时说：对于犯了严重错误的人，我们坚持从严要求，通过批评和斗争把他们教育、争取、团结过来。我们向他们交代政策，做思想政治工作，用毛主席关于“犯了错误则要求改正，改正得越迅速，越彻底，越好”的教导去教育他们，要求他们很好地交代和检查自己的错误和问题，同一小撮阶级敌人划清界限，取得群众的谅解。对于犯了一般错误的同志，我们引导群众帮助他们活学活用毛主席著作，通过斗私批修，参加革命大批判，认识和改正自己的错误。
    这样做的结果，一些犯了错误或严重错误的人，就交代和检查了自己的错误，从而团结了大多数，更加孤立了一小撮阶级敌人。许多犯过错误的人在对敌斗争会上，愤怒揭发阶级敌人的罪行，有的还当场把指使自己干坏事的阶级敌人揭露了出来。
    我们萍乡矿务局由于坚持团结一切可以团结的人，调动一切可以调动的积极因素，组成了浩浩荡荡的革命大军，不仅对敌斗争取得了重大胜利，生产斗争也打了大胜仗，全矿煤炭产量近几个月来大幅度上升，一月超过一月。五月二十二日还创造了全矿日产煤超过万吨的历史最高纪录。
