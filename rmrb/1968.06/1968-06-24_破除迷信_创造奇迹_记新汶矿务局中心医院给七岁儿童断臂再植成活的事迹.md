Early one afternoon in the new year, just as the factory whistle blew, a critically injured child—seven-year-old Chen Aiguo with a severed arm—was rushed into the Central Hospital of the New Wencheng Mining Bureau.

The incident occurred shortly after lunch. The lively and cheerful little Aiguo was playing with a whip near the return pulley at the Zhangzhuang Mine. The whip got caught in the pulley, and as Aiguo reached out to grab it, his left upper arm, about one-third from the shoulder, was crushed and severed. Half of his little arm lay on the ground.

The operating room became a battlefield for criticizing and repudiating revisionism.

When the miners and the child's parents brought him into the hospital's operating room, within a few short minutes, the medical staff who were to perform the emergency surgery immediately began their preparations.

The attending physicians, Zhang Xingtui and Miao Yajiu, approached the operating table and carefully examined Aiguo's injuries: the child's face was pale, his forehead covered in cold sweat, and his severed arm was already cold and waxy. They hesitated, whispering to each other, "Remember last year, Miao? We had two cases of severed limbs, and the results were far from satisfactory..." "Yes, a child's arm is so thin; it's even harder to reattach. If we can't reattach it, that's one thing, but if it endangers his life, that's a bigger problem. Shanghai and other big cities have done limb reattachment, but how can we compare to them?"

Performing this complex surgery presented numerous challenges. However, it was also important to recognize that, with the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest directives, the outlook of the surgeons in the operating room had significantly improved. Moreover, these doctors had some basic skills in performing such surgeries. The question remained: would they be intimidated by the difficulties or would they summon the courage to overcome them? In the minds of the medical staff, a battle raged between "daring" and "fear," "public" and "private."

At this critical moment, military doctor Zhu Xuehua brought instructions from the Military Control Committee: "The committee requires you to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to treat this surgery as a political battle, to overcome all difficulties, to reattach the child's arm, and to create new achievements for the people!"

Zhu Xuehua passionately told everyone, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Our responsibility is to the people,' 'We must eliminate all weak and incompetent thoughts within ourselves.' We must follow Chairman Mao's words, take responsibility to the people, dare to break old frameworks and foreign dogmas, and forge a path where none have gone before, and scale heights where none have reached."

Chairman Mao's teachings shattered the medical staff's negative thoughts of fear, self-doubt, and reluctance to take responsibility, greatly boosting their courage to overcome all difficulties and achieve victory in the limb reattachment.

The surgery began swiftly. The first challenge was anesthesia. Aiguo was now in shock, and full-body anesthesia carried certain risks. Anesthesiologist Li Minghua felt the weight of his responsibility. He recited Chairman Mao's teachings: "In the world, one must fear the words 'seriousness'; the Communist Party is the most serious." He focused intently on administering the anesthetic, ensuring the child safely entered a deep sleep, paving the way for a smooth surgery.

The greatest challenge in the surgery was the vascular anastomosis. Doctors Miao Yajiu and Zhang Xingtui took the lead, with Shi Qingde and Li Deming closely assisting. They first located the blood vessels. The major blood vessels on the distal end of the severed limb were quickly found, but the major veins on the proximal end were not. To find the major veins, everyone, with the determination of "moving mountains" and the spirit of "seizing the day," searched meticulously and finally located the veins. Immediately, the doctors began the anastomosis of the brachial artery. Although the brachial artery was relatively thick, its diameter was only about the size of a matchstick. On such a small opening, eight stitches had to be sewn, and for each stitch, the nurse had to thread the needle.

The nurse in charge of threading the needle, Li Yongxiang, had poor vision, but with her fiery class sentiments, she carefully threaded the tiny, mosquito-leg-sized crescent needles with silk-thin nylon threads, ensuring the surgery's needs were met in a timely manner.

After more than half an hour of intense battle, the first blood vessel was successfully connected. When the doctor released the vascular clamp, the previously shriveled blood vessel immediately showed signs of pulsation, and the waxy, cold severed arm gradually regained its warmth and color. At this moment, everyone in the operating room was filled with joy and triumph.

However, just as they were about to connect the last vein, an unexpected event occurred—the brachial artery became occluded, and the reattached limb turned cold again. At this point, the surgery had been ongoing for over three hours. Theoretically, in normal temperatures, a severed limb that remains disconnected for more than six hours cannot be successfully reattached. If they did not proceed, the child's severed arm would be lost; if they continued, the prolonged time might not only fail to reattach the limb but also endanger the child's life. Should they continue the surgery or stop to save the child's life? Military doctor Zhu Xuehua, who had rushed to the scene, discussed with everyone urgently. At this critical moment, Chairman Mao's teachings on seeing achievements and light in times of difficulty gave Zhu Xuehua boundless strength. He decisively told the medical staff, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'In times of difficulty, we must see achievements, see light, and raise our spirits.' Just now, everyone successfully connected the blood vessels, proving that vascular anastomosis is not a problem. Now, everyone needs to raise their spirits and calmly find the cause of the vascular occlusion."

Doctor Miao immediately declared: "If we fail once, we try twice; if twice fails, we try three times. We must 'overcome all difficulties and strive for victory.'" Thus, everyone turned their attention back to finding the cause of the blood clot occlusion. It turned out that the blood vessel "debridement" was not thorough enough, and the blood had not been heparinized (heparinization of blood prevents clot formation at the anastomosis site). Once the problem was identified, they immediately took corresponding measures, cutting away the first anastomosis site, removing the clot, and re-suturing. The brachial artery was successfully re-connected, and the previously cold limb regained its warmth.

Subsequently, through the doctors' concentrated and meticulous efforts, they found the thin, cicada-wing-like nerve membranes amidst the bloody flesh and carefully sutured each nerve. After six to seven hours of intense battle, Aiguo's arm was finally reattached. The medical staff and the crowd outside the operating room were overjoyed, spreading the news. The child's parents were moved to tears, gazing at Chairman Mao's portrait for a long time before finally saying, "Chairman Mao is our savior!"

The child's arm was reattached, but this did not guarantee its survival. To ensure its viability, much more work needed to be done. The medical staff formed a rescue team to face new challenges.

Without foresight, there can be no leadership. The rescue team anticipated potential issues post-surgery: edema and infection. They conducted in-depth research and preparation for these issues. As anticipated, edema occurred the night after the surgery, peaking on the fourth day, with Aiguo's arm swelling significantly. Witnessing this, everyone was anxious. If the edema continued, not only would the reattachment surgery fail, but it could also endanger the child's life. Those days, the rescue team held meeting after meeting, actively seeking solutions. Based on the experience of the Sixth Hospital in Shanghai for limb reattachment, edema could be managed by making multiple small incisions on the affected limb to relieve pressure. However, this method risked infection, especially given the hospital's limited conditions, which could not guarantee against infection. The rescue team, following Chairman Mao's teachings on "discovery, invention, creation, and progress," was determined to find a method to reduce swelling without incisions. Finally, they devised the following measures: strengthening political responsibility, constant vigilance, daily room disinfection, close observation of the wound; gently massaging the affected limb to promote blood circulation; elevating the arm to speed up blood return; removing the tighter sutures at the limb anastomosis site to reduce pressure. Practice proved these methods effective, and the edema gradually subsided.

Thanks to the coordinated efforts of the entire hospital, after ten days of relentless struggle, they finally overcame the edema and passed the final hurdle. Later, they safely performed the skin graft surgery. Aiguo's severed arm was completely viable and gradually regained its function. Now, the bones have almost healed, and the wrist joint can bend freely.

Every morning, Aiguo, led by the nurses and his parents, salutes Chairman Mao, wishing him eternal life! He sings joyfully, "The party's love is greater than heaven and earth, parents' love is not as great as Chairman Mao's love."

    破除迷信  创造奇迹
    ——记新汶矿务局中心医院给七岁儿童断臂再植成活的事迹
    年初的一天下午，矿区上班的汽笛刚响过，中心医院来了一位重伤员——断臂的七岁儿童陈爱国。
    事情发生在当天午饭后，天真活泼的小爱国，手持鞭子，在张庄矿区无极绳回轮盘前玩耍。鞭子被卷入了回轮盘，小爱国伸手去取，不幸的事情发生了：他的左上臂中下三分之一处，被轮盘轧断，半截小胳膊掉在一旁。
    把手术室变成斗私批修的战场
    当矿区的工人和孩子的家长，把孩子送进医院手术室的时候，短短的几分钟内，参加抢救的医护人员，立即投入了抢救的准备工作。
    主治医生张兴倜、缪亚遒来到手术台前，仔细观察小爱国的伤情：孩子面色苍白，满额冷汗，离断的手臂已变得冰冷、蜡黄。他们不禁犹豫起来，小声议论着：“老缪，还记得吧，去年我们接过两个断肢，效果很不理想……”“是啊，小孩胳膊细，接起来更难呀！接不上事小，危及生命事大。断肢再植，上海等大城市作过，可咱们哪能比得上人家！”
    完成这项复杂的手术，确有许许多多的困难。但是，更要看到：通过落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，外科手术室的同志的思想面貌焕然一新，而且这里医生作这类手术是有些基本功的，……那末，是被困难吓倒，还是发扬勇敢战斗的精神去战胜困难？在医护人员的脑海中，展开了“敢”与“怕”、“公”与“私”的搏斗。
    正在这紧要关头，军医朱学华同志带来了军管会党委的指示：党委要求你们，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把这次手术当作政治仗去打，要战胜一切困难，把孩子的胳膊接上去，为人民立新功！
    朱学华满腔热情地对大家说：“毛主席教导我们：‘我们的责任是向人民负责’，‘我们应当在自己内部肃清一切软弱无能的思想’。我们要听毛主席的话，向人民负责，敢于打破旧框框、洋教条，走前人没走过的路，攀前人没有攀过的高峰。”
    毛主席的教导，大破了一些医护人员畏难、自馁和怕负责任的消极思想，大长了他们排除万难、争取断臂再植胜利的勇气。
    手术迅速开始了，第一关就是麻醉。小爱国这时已处于休克状态，全身麻醉有一定的危险性。麻醉医生李明水，深感自己责任重大。他默念着毛主席关于“世界上怕就怕‘认真’二字，共产党就最讲‘认真’”的教导，聚精会神地滴点着麻醉剂，使孩子安全地进入了熟睡状态，为手术顺利进行铺平了道路。
    手术最大的难关是吻合血管。缪亚遒、张兴倜医生亲自动手，施庆德、李德明医生紧密配合，首先找血管，远端断面上的几条主要血管很快就找到了，而近端断面上的几条主要静脉还没有找到。为了把主要静脉找出来，大家以“愚公移山”的决心和“只争朝夕”的精神，细致地寻找，终于把静脉找到了。紧接着医生们就开始进行肱动脉的吻合。肱动脉虽然是比较粗的一条，但直径也只不过火柴棍那么粗，在这样细小的口径上，就要缝上八针，每缝一针，护士要穿一次线。
    担任穿线的护士李永祥，眼睛近视，但她怀着火热的阶级感情，捏着小如蜜蜂足的月形针，细心地穿着细如蚕丝的尼龙线，及时地保证了手术的需要。
    经过半个多小时的紧张战斗，第一条血管终于接通了。当医生将血管夹子一松，干扁扁的血管立即显露出来，重新有了搏动，蜡黄、冰冷的断臂又渐渐变得红润起来。这时手术室内的同志，个个充满着胜利的喜悦。
    在困难的时候要提高勇气
    可是，就在他们接通最后一条静脉的瞬间，又发生了意外的事情——肱动脉发生了栓塞，刚刚接上的断臂又凉了下来。这时，手术已经进行三个多小时了，从理论上讲，在常温下离断的肢体，超过六小时不接通，即使再植也无法成活。这时候，如果不接，孩子的断臂就没有救了；如果继续接下去，时间一拖长，不但断臂不能接上，小孩的生命也有危险。手术继续进行下去呢？还是停止下来设法保全小孩的生命呢？闻讯赶来的朱学华军医，和大家一起急迫地思考着，商量着。就在这关键时刻，毛主席关于在困难的时候要看到成绩的教导，给朱学华增添了无穷的力量。他果断地向医护人员们说：“毛主席教导我们：‘在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。’刚才大家已经把血管接通了，这说明吻合血管是不成问题了，现在大家需要的是提高勇气，冷静地找出血管堵塞的原因。”
    缪医生当场表示：一次接不成，接二次，二次不行三次，一定要“排除万难，去争取胜利”。就这样，大家又转入寻找造成血栓堵塞的原因。原来是血管“清创”不够彻底，同时血液还未肝素化（血液肝素化后，吻合处不易形成血栓）。问题找到了，他们立即采取了相应的措施，把第一次吻合的血管创面剪了去，取出血栓，重新缝合起来。肱动脉终于再一次接通了，那只已经凉了下来的断臂，又重新发热了。
    接着，又经过医生们全神贯注、一丝不苟的努力，终于在血肉模糊的创面上把薄如蝉翼的神经膜找到了，把一条条神经也一针针地缝合好了。经过六七个小时紧张战斗，小爱国的胳膊终于接上了。医护人员和手术室外的群众，个个欢喜若狂，人人奔走相告。孩子的家长激动得热泪盈眶，仰望着毛主席画像，半天才说出了一句话：“毛主席是俺们的救命恩人！”
    再接再厉争取最后胜利
    孩子的胳膊接上了，并不等于接活了，要保证它的成活，还有许多工作要跟上去。医护人员成立了抢救小组，迎接新的战斗。
    没有预见，谈不上领导。抢救小组预料小孩手术后可能出现的问题，一是水肿，二是感染。针对这些问题，他们做了重点研究和准备。预料的问题果然发生了。手术后的当天夜里就出现了水肿，到第四天达到了高峰，小爱国的手臂肿得圆鼓鼓的。目睹这种情况，大家十分焦急，如果让水肿继续发展下去，不但再植手术会失败，甚至要危及小孩的生命。那几天，抢救组的会议开了一次又一次，积极寻找对策。根据上海第六医院断肢再植的经验，发生水肿后，可以在患肢上作多处小切口，以达到减压的目的。但是，这样做，容易引起感染。尤其是医院的条件差，更不能保证不发生感染。抢救组遵照毛主席关于“有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进”的教导，决心找出一条既不切口又能消肿的办法来。最后，大家想出了如下措施：加强政治责任心，日夜看护，每天病房消毒，严密观察伤情；用手轻轻抚摩患肢，促进血液循环；抬高手臂，加快血液回流；拆除断肢吻合处较紧的缝线，减轻压迫。实践证明，这些办法是行之有效的，水肿逐日减轻。
    由于全院同志有机配合，同心协力，经过十几天的日夜奋战，终于战胜了水肿，通过了最后一道难关。后来，又安全地进行了植皮手术。小爱国的断臂完全成活了，并且逐步恢复了功能。现在，骨骼已基本愈合，腕关节已能自由伸屈。
    每天清早起床，小爱国在护士和家长的带领下，向毛主席敬礼，祝毛主席万寿无疆！尽情欢唱“天大地大不如党的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲。”
