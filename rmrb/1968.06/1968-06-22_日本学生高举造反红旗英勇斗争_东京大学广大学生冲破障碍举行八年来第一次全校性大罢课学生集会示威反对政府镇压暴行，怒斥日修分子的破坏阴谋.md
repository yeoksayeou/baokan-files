Thousands of students at Tokyo University bravely broke through obstacles to hold their first school-wide strike and rally in eight years, protesting against the government's suppression and denouncing the treacherous plots of the Japan Communist Party (JCP) revisionists.

Xinhua News Agency, June 21st: According to a report from the Oriental News Agency, students at Tokyo University and Nihon University went on strike to oppose the school authorities' fascist rule and the Sato government's dispatch of armed police to suppress the students' just struggle.

On the 20th, a large number of students at Tokyo University held their first school-wide strike in eight years, protesting against the school authorities' action of bringing in a large number of armed police into the campus early in the morning on June 17th to suppress the just struggle of the medical students.

That morning, the striking students used desks and chairs to set up barricades at the entrances of their respective teaching buildings and posted "Complete Strike" slogans at the entrances. Red flags flew throughout the campus, and slogans such as "Down with the Sato Government!", "Abolish the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty!", "Oppose Police Suppression of Students!", and "Learn from the Brave Struggle of Paris University Students!" could be seen everywhere. The walls of all school buildings were covered with resolutions condemning the reactionary school authorities.

	Students participating in the strike, at meetings held in their respective departments, exposed the various shameful plots of the JCP revisionists to sabotage the students' just struggle.

	In the afternoon, over 5,000 students gathered in front of the main school building for a rally. A representative of the medical students, who have been at the forefront of the struggle, spoke, vowing to continue the fight to the end. He called on all attendees to be as bold and persistent in their struggle as the students of Paris University.

	After the rally, the participants took to the streets for a massive demonstration.

	The struggle of Nihon University students against the school authorities' fascist rule is developing rapidly. By June 20th, out of the university's eleven departments, six had gone on strike. The striking students also occupied the teaching building and held meetings to discuss various issues related to the student struggle.

	On the afternoon of the 20th, about 1,000 students from this university rushed into the university's main building, driving out the university authorities who had refused to accept the students' just demands, and sealing off the building.

    日本学生高举造反红旗英勇斗争
    东京大学广大学生冲破障碍举行八年来第一次全校性大罢课学生集会示威反对政府镇压暴行，怒斥日修分子的破坏阴谋
    新华社二十一日讯 据东方通讯社报道：东京大学和日本大学的学生举行罢课，反对学校当局对学生实行法西斯统治和佐藤政府派武装警察镇压学生的正义斗争。
    东京大学的广大学生二十日举行了八年来的第一次全校性罢课，抗议学校当局六月十七日清晨把大批武装警察引入校内镇压医疗系学生的正义斗争。
    这天早上，举行罢课的学生用桌椅在各自的教学楼入口处设置障碍，并在进门处贴上了“全面罢课”的标语。整个校园内红旗飘扬，到处都可看到
  “打倒佐藤政府！”“废除日美安全条约！”“反对警察镇压学生！”“向巴黎大学学生的英勇斗争学习！”等标语。学校的所有建筑物的墙上都贴满了谴责学校反动当局的决议。
    参加罢课的学生在各系召开的会议上，揭露了日修分子破坏学生正义斗争的各种可耻阴谋。
    当天下午，五千多名学生在校部大楼前的广场上召开大会。一直站在斗争前列的医疗系学生代表发表讲话，表示坚决要把斗争进行到底。他号召全体与会者要象巴黎大学的学生那样敢于斗争、坚持斗争。
    会后，与会者到大街上举行了声势浩大的示威游行。
    日本大学学生反对学校当局对学生实行法西斯统治的斗争发展迅猛。到六月二十日，全大学十一个系中，已有六个系举行罢课。罢课学生还占领了教学大楼，并举行集会，讨论关于学生斗争的各种问题。
    二十日下午，这所大学的约一千名学生冲进了大学总部大楼，把一直拒绝接受学生正义要求的大学当局的人员从大楼里赶走，并且封锁了这幢大楼。
