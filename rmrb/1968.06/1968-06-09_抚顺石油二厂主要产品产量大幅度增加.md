The revolutionary workers of Fushun Petroleum Factory No. 2, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support troops, resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production." They have launched a thorough revolutionary criticism campaign, smashed the evil plots of class enemies to disrupt the revolution and production, and have made the revolution roar and production flourish. Since January this year, the monthly growth rate of the factory's crude oil processing volume and the production of several major products such as gasoline, kerosene, and diesel oil has been over ten percent. Since May, the production level has increased even more significantly compared to April. The quality of all products leaving the factory meets national standards, making new contributions to supporting the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

    抚顺石油二厂主要产品产量大幅度增加
    抚顺石油二厂的广大革命职工在人民解放军支左部队的帮助下，坚决执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，深入开展革命大批判，粉碎阶级敌人破坏抓革命促生产的罪恶阴谋，革命搞得轰轰烈烈，生产蒸蒸日上。今年一月份起，全厂原油加工量和汽油、煤油、柴油等几项主要产品产量的增长率，每月都在百分之十以上；五月份以来生产水平又比四月份有更大幅度的增长。出厂产品质量全部达到国家标准，为支援社会主义革命和社会主义建设作出了新的贡献。
