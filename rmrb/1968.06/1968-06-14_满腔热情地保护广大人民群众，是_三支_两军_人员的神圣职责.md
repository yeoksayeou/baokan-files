In carrying out our military training mission, we deeply felt that the attitude taken towards the broad masses of the people, whether to protect or suppress them, is the fundamental dividing line between revolution and counter-revolution, and the fundamental dividing line between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the bourgeois reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line represents the interests of the proletariat and the broad masses of laboring people, and is a line of believing in, relying on, and protecting the broad masses of the people. The bourgeois reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev represents the interests of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the bourgeoisie, and all exploiting classes, and is a line of ruthlessly suppressing the broad masses of the people and imposing bourgeois dictatorship on them.

The proletarian cultural revolution at Beijing Stone Gate Mountain Middle School, like in other parts of the country, has been marked by intense and complex struggles between the two lines from the very beginning. When the flames of the proletarian cultural revolution were just ignited, the revolutionary teachers, students, and cadres were immediately subjected to persecution by the bourgeois reactionary line pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev. A large number of revolutionary youngsters, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary cadres were labeled as "counter-revolutionaries." In the fierce struggle between the two lines, we followed Chairman Mao's instructions to "support the leftist broad masses" and "protect the leftists." We stood up for the revolutionary teachers and students who had been persecuted, mobilized the revolutionary teachers and students, and launched a great exposure, criticism, and struggle against the bourgeois reactionary line, smashing the arrogant attacks of the bourgeois reactionary line. This led to a flourishing situation in the proletarian cultural revolution at Beijing Stone Gate Mountain Middle School, quickly achieving revolutionary unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, and establishing a revolutionary committee. Later, a small handful of class enemies inside and outside the school colluded with each other, repeatedly launching counterattacks, disrupting the correct direction of "resuming classes and making revolution," attempting to sabotage the revolutionary unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, and overthrow the revolutionary committee and split the proletarian revolutionary ranks. In this situation, the comrades in our military training team repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's instructions: "To stand firmly with the Chinese people and serve them heart and soul is the sole purpose of this army." We went among the masses to propagate Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, mobilizing the revolutionary masses to resolutely smash the conspiracies of a small handful of class enemies.

At the critical moment of winning a comprehensive victory in the proletarian cultural revolution, a small handful of die-hard capitalist-roaders within the party attempted to struggle desperately. They colluded with the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, stirring up a rightist wind of reversing correct verdicts, directly aiming at the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and at the newly established revolutionary committees. They launched a frenzied counterattack and revenge against the proletarian revolutionaries, attempting to negate the great achievements of the revolutionary youngsters and oppose Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

In this complex situation, we firmly remembered Chairman Mao's great teaching: "Never forget class struggle." We helped the school revolutionary committee organize all revolutionary teachers and students to seriously study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, using Mao Zedong Thought to analyze the new situation, new trends, and new characteristics of class struggle, further deepening the revolutionary criticism and struggle, and thoroughly criticizing and exposing the bourgeois reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev. We led the revolutionary masses to launch a fierce offensive against a small handful of class enemies, resolutely smashing the rightist wind of reversing correct verdicts.

The deepening of revolutionary criticism and struggle against the enemy further consolidated the newly established revolutionary committee, purified the revolutionary ranks, and promoted the proletarian educational revolution. In the fierce struggle against the bourgeois reactionary line, we firmly supported and protected the revolutionary masses, forging a deep proletarian bond of friendship with them. Revolutionary teachers and students said: Whether in the days of fierce warfare or in the years of fighting against enemies who do not carry guns, the People's Liberation Army, personally founded and led by Chairman Mao, has always been the faithful defender of the people. Our military training work also won the support and approval of the revolutionary teachers and students. The entire school of revolutionary teachers and students, following Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, achieved new victories in the process of "resuming classes and making revolution."

    满腔热情地保护广大人民群众，是“三支”“两军”人员的神圣职责
    北京石景山中学军训团
    我们在执行军训任务中深深地体会到：对广大人民群众采取什么态度，是保护还是镇压，是革命同反革命的根本分界线，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线同中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线的根本分界线。毛主席的无产阶级革命路线代表了无产阶级和广大劳动人民的利益，是一条相信、依靠、保护广大人民群众的路线。中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线，代表了国民党反动派、资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的利益，是一条残酷镇压广大人民群众，对广大人民群众实行资产阶级专政的路线。
    石景山中学的无产阶级文化大革命，和全国各地一样，自始至终充满了尖锐复杂的两条路线斗争。当无产阶级文化大革命的烈火刚刚点燃，广大革命师生就受到了中国赫鲁晓夫推行的资产阶级反动路线的迫害，一大批革命小将、革命教师和革命干部被打成“反革命”。在两条路线激烈的大搏斗中，我们遵照毛主席关于“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”和“要保护左派”的教导，为遭受打击迫害的革命师生撑腰，发动广大革命师生，对资产阶级反动路线进行了大揭发、大批判、大斗争，粉碎了资产阶级反动路线的猖狂进攻，使石景山中学的无产阶级文化大革命出现了蓬勃发展的大好形势，迅速实现了革命大联合和革命三结合，建立了革命委员会。后来，校内外的一小撮阶级敌人互相勾结，又一次一次地进行反扑，干扰复课闹革命的大方向，妄图破坏革命的大联合和革命的三结合，颠覆革命委员会、分裂无产阶级革命队伍。在这种情况下，我们军训团的同志，又反复学习了毛主席的教导：“紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。”我们到群众中去宣传毛主席的一系列最新指示，发动广大革命群众坚决粉碎了一小撮阶级敌人的阴谋。
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，党内一小撮顽固不化的走资派妄图垂死挣扎，他们勾结国民党反动派的残渣余孽，刮起了一股右倾翻案妖风，把矛头直接指向以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，指向新生的革命委员会，猖狂地向无产阶级革命派进行反攻倒算，妄图否定革命小将的丰功伟绩，反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    在这种错综复杂的情况下，我们牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，帮助校革委会组织全校革命师生认真地学习毛主席的最新指示，用毛泽东思想来分析阶级斗争的新形势、新动向、新特点，进一步深入开展革命的大批判，大批大揭中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线，带领广大革命群众，主动地向一小撮阶级敌人发动猛烈的进攻，坚决粉碎右倾翻案妖风。
    革命大批判和对敌斗争的深入开展，进一步巩固了新生的革命委员会、纯洁了革命队伍，推动了无产阶级教育革命。在同资产阶级反动路线的激烈搏斗中，我们坚定地支持和保护了广大革命群众，同广大革命群众结下了鱼水般的深厚无产阶级情谊。革命师生们说：不论在炮火纷飞的战争年代，还是在同不拿枪的敌人作斗争的岁月里，毛主席亲自缔造和领导的人民解放军永远是人民群众的忠实保卫者。我们的军训工作，也得到了广大革命师生的拥护和支持。全校革命师生沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，在复课闹革命中不断取得新的胜利。
