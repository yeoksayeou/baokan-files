To commemorate the first anniversary of the Arab people's resistance against the U.S.-Israeli aggression, on June 5, Arab workers in the Israeli-occupied areas went on a general strike. People from various sectors in many Arab countries also held rallies and marches, strongly condemning the savage crimes of U.S.-Israeli aggression, and expressing their determination to resist the Israeli aggressors.

According to reports from Syrian newspapers, on June 5, in cities on the West Bank of the Jordan River such as Jerusalem (Arab area), Nablus, Jenin, Ramallah, Jericho, Tulkarm, Bethlehem, and Hebron, as well as in the Gaza Strip cities of Gaza, Rafah, Khan Yunis, and Al-Arish in the Sinai Peninsula, Arab workers went on a general strike. Students boycotted classes, teachers stopped teaching, and merchants closed their shops. All enterprises and stores were shut down, public transportation came to a halt, and residents stayed at home to protest against the aggression of U.S. imperialism and Zionism.

In Jerusalem, thousands of Arabs, despite threats from the Israeli reactionary authorities, held a mass demonstration and marched to the graves of martyrs who had fallen in the resistance against U.S.-Israeli aggression, paying their respects. The Israeli reactionary authorities dispatched a large number of military police to suppress the demonstration, injuring many protesters and arresting thirty Arabs. The demonstrators, facing fully armed Israeli military police, engaged in a fierce struggle, killing one Israeli officer and injuring two officers, four soldiers, and one policeman.

Workers, peasants, students, and women's organizations in Syria issued separate statements condemning the aggression of U.S. imperialism and Israel, and expressing their determination to liberate the occupied lands through armed struggle.

In Cairo, residents observed a minute of silence at noon to mourn the martyrs who had fallen in the resistance against U.S.-Israeli aggression last year.

In the capital of Yemen, Sana'a, a military parade was held at Liberation Square. Prime Minister Amri inspected the troops.

The National Liberation Front of South Yemen issued a statement in Aden, emphasizing that the Palestinian issue can only be resolved through the mobilization of the people's armed struggle. The statement called on Arab countries to support the Palestinian people's resistance movement that is currently fighting.

In the Jordanian capital Amman, a rally of ten thousand people was held. Speakers at the rally expressed their firm support for the Palestinian guerrillas. After the rally, a march was held, with some participants holding banners reading "Armed struggle is the path to victory."

On June 5, Iraq held a nationwide strike to protest against Israeli aggression. A mass rally and march were also held in the capital Baghdad.

In the Lebanese capital Beirut, mass demonstrations were held, with demonstrators chanting "Give us weapons—we will fight," expressing their determination to resist the U.S.-Israeli aggressors.

The Arab Lawyers' Union issued a statement in Cairo, pointing out that the United States' infringement on Arab rights and support for Israel in various ways is a clear manifestation of imperialism's conspiracy against all Arab countries. "Therefore, our struggle against aggression and occupation is not only a struggle against the imperialist tool Israel, but also a struggle against colonialism and imperialism."

The statement hailed the Palestinian guerrillas as "the vanguard of the battle to restore Arab dignity." The statement called on the Arab people to unite and defeat U.S.-led imperialism and its aggressive tool, Israel.
