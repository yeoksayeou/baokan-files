On a warm and sunny afternoon, cadres and soldiers from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Menhe's hometown, with hearts full of deep respect, carried a colored portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao to the home of the comrade Menhe, who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. They came to learn from him.

"Uncle! Auntie! We've come to visit you two! We've come to learn from Comrade Menhe, the good cadre who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!" The unit commander said as he shook hands tightly with Uncle Menhe and Auntie Menhe who came forward to greet them. At this moment, everyone crowded around, sitting closely beside the two elderly people. Comrades one after another said to Uncle and Auntie: "Comrade Menhe is a good cadre of Chairman Mao. He has set a glorious example for us, being infinitely loyal to the people, to the Party, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We must learn from the hero Menhe and be like him, 'thinking of Chairman Mao in everything, obeying Chairman Mao in everything, following Chairman Mao in everything, and doing everything for Chairman Mao.' We will be good cadres and soldiers, infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!"

Under the bright sunlight, the nearly seventy-year-old parents of the hero looked at the vigorous revolutionary soldiers, listening attentively as they recounted the struggles of Menhe before he joined the army. Their hearts were filled with indescribable joy. When the soldiers presented the great leader Chairman Mao's statue, colored portrait, and revolutionary books to the elderly, and pinned the shining Mao badge neatly on their chests, the two elderly people held Chairman Mao's portrait tightly to their chests, looking at it again and again, touching it again and again. Auntie Menhe said excitedly, "Chairman Mao is our great benefactor. Our family will never forget Chairman Mao. When Menhe was born, he followed me begging for food, suffering all the hardships of the old society. It was Chairman Mao who saved our family. Today, Menhe has done a little for the Party, all thanks to Chairman Mao's teachings. Without Chairman Mao, how could we have our good days today!"

The comrades, learning from the glorious deeds of Comrade Menhe in front of his home, felt particularly close. Comrade Menhe's lofty qualities of infinite love and loyalty to Chairman Mao and his revolutionary line deeply educated everyone.

    一个风和日暖的下午，驻门合同志家乡的解放军某部的干部、战士，怀着无比崇敬的心情，捧着伟大领袖毛主席的彩色画像，来到了无限忠于毛主席的好干部门合同志的家里，向门合同志学习。
    “大伯！大妈！我们来看望你两位老人家来啦！我们向‘无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部’门合同志学习来啦！”部队首长一边说一边向迎上前来的门大伯、门大妈紧紧地握手。这时同志们都拥上来，亲热地围坐在两位老人家的身旁。同志们纷纷向大伯、大妈说：门合同志是毛主席的好干部，他为我们树立了无限忠于人民，无限忠于党，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席革命路线的光辉榜样。我们一定要向英雄门合学习，象他那样“一切想着毛主席，一切服从毛主席，一切紧跟毛主席，一切为着毛主席”，做无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部、好战士！
    灿烂的阳光下，年近七十的英雄父母，看着一个个朝气蓬勃的革命战士，聚精会神地听他们讲门合参军以前的斗争事迹，心里有说不出的喜悦。当战士们把伟大领袖毛主席的塑像、彩色画像和革命宝书送给老人家，把金光闪闪的毛主席像章，端端正正地佩戴在老人家胸前时，两位老人家把毛主席像紧紧捧在胸前，看了又看，摸了又摸。门大妈激动地说：“毛主席是咱穷人的大恩人，俺家世世代代忘不了毛主席。合子生下来就跟着我要饭，吃尽了旧社会的苦，是毛主席救了我们一家。合子今天为党做了一点事，也全靠毛主席他老人家教导得好，要是没有毛主席，那有我们今天的好日子！”同志们听着门大妈的话，个个激动万分，一遍又一遍地高呼：“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”“祝福毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”一遍又一遍地高唱《大海航行靠舵手》、《爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲》。
    同志们在门合的家门前学习了门合同志的光辉事迹，觉得格外亲切。门合同志无限热爱毛主席，无限忠于毛主席革命路线的崇高品质，使大家受到极为深刻的教育。
