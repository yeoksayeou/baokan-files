The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China sends a telegram to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Malaya, warmly congratulating the Malayan people's anti-British national liberation war on its 20th anniversary. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Malaya, Dear Comrades,

On the 20th anniversary of the Malayan people's anti-British national liberation war, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China extends warm fraternal greetings to you.

The Communist Party of Malaya has led the people of various ethnic groups in Malaya in a heroic armed struggle against British imperialists and their lackeys. This struggle has gone through a glorious course. It has dealt a heavy blow to British imperialist colonial rule in Malaya and made a great contribution to the cause of national independence and liberation in Malaya. The revolutionary armed struggle of the Malayan people has also powerfully struck at the imperialists led by the United States and their lackeys, as well as the modern revisionists centered around the Soviet revisionist renegade clique, and actively supported the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression for national salvation.

The Communist Party of China is firmly convinced that the Communist Party of Malaya, which has been tempered and trained in the fire of war, will combine the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought with the specific conditions of Malaya, firmly grasp the banner of armed struggle, closely unite the people of various ethnic groups in Malaya, rely firmly on the masses of the people, consolidate and expand the rural revolutionary base areas, develop and strengthen the revolutionary armed forces, and persist in the struggle. It will certainly be able to lead the Malayan people to drive out the imperialist aggressors of Britain and the United States, overthrow the puppet regimes of Rahman and Lee Kuan Yew, and establish a new, truly independent, unified, and democratic Malaya.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has achieved decisive victories. The counter-revolutionary plot of the Chinese Khrushchev and other representatives of the bourgeoisie to restore capitalism in China has suffered a shameful defeat. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has greatly consolidated and strengthened the dictatorship of the proletariat in our country. The strength of the Chinese people, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, is stronger than ever before, enabling us to better fulfill our great internationalist duties.

The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people firmly support the Communist Party of Malaya in leading the Malayan people in their revolutionary struggle to smash "Malaysia," overthrow the reactionary rule of British imperialism and its lackeys, and strive for the genuine independence, unity, and democracy of Malaya.

Long live the armed struggle of the Malayan people!

Central Committee of the Communist Party of China

    中国共产党中央委员会致马来亚共产党中央委员会的贺电
    新华社二十日讯　中国共产党中央委员会致电马来亚共产党中央委员会，热烈祝贺马来亚人民抗英民族解放战争二十周年。贺电全文如下：马来亚共产党中央委员会亲爱的同志们：
    在马来亚人民抗英民族解放战争二十周年的时候，中国共产党中央委员会向你们致以热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    马来亚共产党领导马来亚各族人民，反对英国殖民主义者及其走狗的英勇的武装斗争，经历了光辉的历程。它沉重地打击了英帝国主义在马来亚的殖民统治，对马来亚的民族独立和解放事业，作出了巨大的贡献。马来亚人民的革命武装斗争，还有力地打击了以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗和以苏修叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义，积极地支持了越南人民的抗美救国战争。
    中国共产党坚信，经受过战争烈火考验和锻炼的马来亚共产党，把马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想的普遍真理同马来亚的具体情况相结合，紧紧掌握武装斗争的红旗，紧密团结马来亚各族人民，坚决依靠人民群众，巩固和扩大农村革命根据地，发展和壮大革命武装力量，坚持斗争下去，一定能够领导马来亚人民，赶走英美帝国主义侵略者，推翻拉赫曼、李光耀傀儡政权，建立一个新的真正独立、统一、民主的马来亚。
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的我国无产阶级文化大革命，取得了决定性的胜利。以中国赫鲁晓夫等为代表的资产阶级反动势力在中国实现资本主义复辟的阴谋，遭到了可耻的失败。无产阶级文化大革命大大巩固和加强了我国无产阶级专政。经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的中国人民的力量，比以往任何时候都更加强大，这就使我们能够更好地完成我们应当担负的国际主义的伟大任务。
    中国共产党和中国人民，坚决支持马来亚共产党领导马来亚人民，为粉碎“马来西亚”，推翻英帝国主义及其走狗的反动统治，争取马来亚的真正独立、统一和民主所进行的革命斗争。
    马来亚人民武装斗争必胜！
                  中国共产党中央委员会
                                一九六八年六月二十日
