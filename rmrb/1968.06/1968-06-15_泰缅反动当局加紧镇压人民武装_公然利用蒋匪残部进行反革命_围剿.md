The reactionary regimes of Thailand and Burma, under the direction of U.S. imperialism, have recently intensified their collusion, openly encouraging and utilizing remnants of the Kuomintang (KMT) that have fled to the Thai-Burmese border. They are conducting joint "extermination" campaigns against the armed forces of the people in both countries.

The radio station "Voice of the Thai People" recently exposed that the Thanom-Kittikachorn traitorous clique in Thailand and the Ne Win reactionary clique in Burma have been intensifying their collusion. They have openly encouraged and utilized the remnants of the KMT that have fled to the Thai-Burmese border to jointly conduct "extermination" campaigns against the armed forces of the people in both countries.

The radio station pointed out that the armed struggle of the people in Thailand and Burma is rapidly developing and growing stronger, dealing heavy blows to the reactionary forces in both countries and their U.S. imperialist masters. They are desperately trying to extinguish the flames of the people's revolutionary armed struggle. The Thanom clique and the Ne Win clique held a meeting last month and decided to jointly suppress the revolutionary armed forces of the people in both countries. The black meeting even agreed that the military and police of both sides could enter each other's territory up to two kilometers to "sweep" out the people's armed forces, and they have encouraged the remnants of the KMT to participate in suppressing the armed forces of the people in both countries.

The radio station said that no matter how desperately the enemy struggles, the people of Thailand and Burma will fight side by side and deal even heavier blows to the enemy.

    泰缅反动当局加紧镇压人民武装
    公然利用蒋匪残部进行反革命“围剿”
    新华社十四日讯　据“泰国人民之声”电台最近揭露，在美帝国主义的指使下，最近以来，泰国他侬—巴博卖国集团和缅甸奈温反动集团加紧互相勾结，公然纵容、利用流窜于泰缅边境的蒋匪残部，对泰、缅两国人民武装采取联合“围剿”行动。
    这家电台指出，泰国和缅甸的人民武装斗争迅速发展壮大，沉重地打击了泰、缅反动派及其主子美帝国主义。它们千方百计地企图扑灭人民革命武装斗争的烈火。他侬集团和奈温集团在上个月举行了会议，决定共同镇压两国的人民革命武装。黑会竟然同意双方的军警可以深入对方境内二公里去“扫荡”人民武装，并纵容蒋匪残部，参加镇压泰、缅两国的人民武装。
    电台说，不管敌人怎样疯狂挣扎，泰国和缅甸两国人民将并肩战斗，给敌人以更加沉重的打击。
