In the facade of economic "prosperity" boasted by the U.S. government, the lives of the vast American working people are becoming increasingly impoverished and difficult.

Recently, a U.S. civilian organization, the "Citizens' Board of Inquiry into Hunger and Malnutrition," after nine months of investigation, released a 100-page report. According to this report's incomplete statistics, "approximately 10 million to 14.5 million people in the U.S. are starving," and "the situation is continuing to worsen."

The report by the "Citizens' Board of Inquiry into Hunger and Malnutrition" states that "starvation is widespread across the country, with the South and Southwest being particularly severe." In twenty states, 256 counties have been designated as "hunger areas," including 47 counties in Georgia, 37 in Mississippi, and 30 in Texas. Even in urban areas such as Washington, New York, Chicago, Boston, Cleveland, and Seattle, malnutrition is present. The report also mentions that "pregnant women in the impoverished class are generally anemic due to malnutrition," and "it is common to see people who are short, light, and underdeveloped." Especially in the South and Southwest, "a large proportion of people suffer from malnutrition and parasitic diseases."

According to reports from American bourgeois newspapers, the Johnson administration had allocated a small amount of funds to implement the so-called "food stamp plan," allowing impoverished residents to purchase food at low prices with food stamps. However, this is merely a deception, as the poorest residents in the U.S. are penniless and cannot afford to buy anything. The *New York Times Magazine* reported on the starvation conditions of American poor people, stating, "In the South, many black people still live in a primitive barter system. They may or may not have jobs, but when they work, it is either to repay old debts or to borrow new ones. There has never been any money exchanged. Tenant farmers, after finishing their work in October last year, still owed the landlord money, or they could only get about fifty dollars, which they immediately took to the city to repay debts. Their pockets are empty for at least six to seven months. For them, even if one person only contributes five cents, it feels like paying two thousand dollars. They simply cannot afford it. If they could afford it, they would have to borrow from the landlord, and these landlords charge interest as high as fifty percent." The *New York Times Magazine* said, "In the South and the border states of the South and North, there are 283 of the poorest counties, of which 93 have no food distribution plans. In the remaining 190 counties, there are 7,103,670 impoverished residents, but only 1,029,000 people receive food subsidies."

An article published in the May 17 issue of the American *Time* magazine, titled "A Nation Within a Nation," revealed the living conditions of the poor in the U.S. The article stated that in the so-called "rich nation" of the U.S., "there exists another nation deprived of various enjoyments and rights, with unbearable living conditions. This nation is composed of 29.7 million Americans," and "they are black, white, red, yellow, and brown men, women, and children living below the 'poverty line.'" *Time* magazine said that according to official statistics, which have been greatly reduced, one-third of these impoverished people are black. Poverty-stricken areas are spread throughout the country, with the South's sixteen states being the most impoverished, and nearly half of the poor in the U.S. live there. The magazine said that currently, "the unemployment rate in the poorest residential areas of the 100 largest cities in the country is 7%."

    美国有一千多万人饿肚皮
    饥民遍于全国，二十个州的二百五十多个县被列为“饥饿区”
    本报讯　在美国官方竭力吹嘘的经济“繁荣”的假象后面，美国广大劳动人民的生活越来越贫困和艰难。
    最近，美国一个民间团体“饥饿与营养不良问题公民调查委员会”经过九个月的调查后，公布了一份长达一百页的调查报告。据这个报告的不完全统计，美国目前“约有一千万至一千四百五十万人受饥挨饿”，而且“情况还在继续恶化”。
    “饥饿与营养不良问题公民调查委员会”的报告说，美国“饥民遍于全国各地，南部和西南部更为突出”，在二十个州内的二百五十六个县被列为“饥饿区”，其中四十七个县在佐治亚州，三十七个县在密西西比州，三十个县在得克萨斯州；甚至于在华盛顿、纽约、芝加哥、波士顿、克利夫兰、西雅图等城市区，也有营养不良现象存在。报告还说，“贫困阶层的孕妇普遍因营养不良而患有慢性贫血症”，“经常可以看到身矮体轻发育不良的人”。特别是在南部和西南部地区，“营养不良和患寄生虫病的人都占有很大的比例”。
    据美国资产阶级报刊报道，约翰逊政府也曾拨出了少量的款项，推行所谓“食品票计划”，贫困的居民凭食品票可以低价购买粮食。但这不过是一套骗人的玩意，因为美国的最贫困的居民，都是囊空如洗，根本没有钱买东西。《纽约时报杂志》在一篇关于美国贫民挨饿情况的报道中说，“南方有许许多多的黑人还在过着以货易货的原始生活。他们有的有工作，有的没有工作，反正他们工作的时候，不是为了偿还旧债，就是为了将来借新债。从来没有银钱过手的事情。”“他们什么也不买。佃农在去年十月忙完一季之后还欠地主的债，不然也只能拿到五十块美元左右，这笔钱也马上拿到城里去还债了。他们口袋里至少有六七个月内是空空如也的。他们一口人要为‘食品票计划’拿出两块美元，对他们说来，哪怕一口人只拿出五角钱，都好象是要交两千美元一样。他们根本就拿不出来。要是他们拿得出来的话，也只有向地主去借，而这些地主索取的利息竟高达百分之五十。”《纽约时报杂志》说，“在南方和南北交界的十五个州有二百八十三个县是最贫穷的，其中有九十三个县没有任何形式的分配食品的计划。在其余的一百九十个县里，有七百一十万零三百六十七名穷苦的居民，但是只有一百零二万九千多人得到粮食补助。”
    五月十七日一期的美国《时代》周刊发表的一篇关于美国贫困问题的专题报道，透露了美国贫穷人民的生活状况。这篇题为《国中之国》的报道说，在号称“富裕国家”的美国，“存在着另一个被剥夺种种享受和权利的、生活难以忍受的国家。这个国家是由二千九百七十万美国人组成的”，“他们是生活在‘贫困线’下的黑色、白色、红色、黄色和棕色的男人、女人和儿童。”《时代》周刊说，据大大缩小的官方统计，这些贫穷人民，有三分之一是黑人。贫困的地区遍及全国，尤其南部十六个州的贫民最为困苦，美国几乎有半数穷人都住在那里。这家周刊说，目前，美国“全国一百个最大城市的最贫穷的居民区失业的比率为百分之七”。
