The Albanian newspaper "The People's Voice" published a commentary on June 27 denouncing the U.S. imperialists, with the support of the Soviet revisionists' betrayal policy, implementing a counter-revolutionary strategy of moving troops eastward, intensifying aggression against Vietnam, and encircling China.

The commentary said that from the recent communiqué issued by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Council meeting, it is clear that "improving East-West relations" is the focus of this meeting. The main boss of NATO, U.S. imperialism, is currently, under Johnson's revisionist "bridge-building" policy, striving to formulate a "new Atlantic strategy." With the Soviet revisionist leadership pushing forward a policy of surrender and betrayal at an even faster pace internationally, and domestically restoring capitalism, prioritizing the anti-revolutionary alliance with the United States, the U.S. leaders are making the expansion and development of "East" and "West" relations the guiding principle of this NATO meeting. Based on this principle, the meeting proposed that the "West" and the "East" gradually and mutually reduce their troops in Europe. The commentary pointed out that the Washington propaganda machine is loudly touting this as "an important measure to achieve peace in Europe."

The commentary said, however, that this cannot cover up the true plots and intentions of the U.S. and its allies. In reality, they intend to use this to strengthen the "bridge" between imperialism and revisionism, divide the European continent into spheres of influence for the two "superpowers," suppress revolutionary and progressive forces, and more broadly carry out political, ideological, and capitalist infiltration in the Soviet Union and other Eastern European revisionist countries. On the other hand, they want to create more favorable conditions for U.S. imperialism to dispatch the majority of its military forces in Europe to Asia, to oppose the people of Vietnam, to oppose the People's Republic of China, and to oppose the liberation movements in Asia. Just as U.S. imperialism is suffering defeats in the battlefield of South Vietnam and is desperately trying to strengthen the military encirclement of the steadfast fighter of revolution and socialism—the people of China—U.S. imperialists are particularly concerned with continuing to transfer their armed forces from Europe to Asia.

The commentary concluded by saying that in the face of this situation, revolutionary forces around the world are drawing corresponding conclusions, heightening their vigilance, and uniting their ranks more closely to fight against the new aggression plans of imperialism and its lackeys. In the fiery struggle for liberation by revolutionary and anti-imperialist forces, imperialism is sinking deeper into crisis. The contradictions within imperialism are also deepening.

    阿《人民之声报》谴责北大西洋侵略集团召开黑会的阴谋
    美帝苏修正在“搭桥”加紧兵力东移
    新华社地拉那二十七日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》二十七日发表评论，谴责美帝在苏修叛卖政策的支持下，推行兵力东移、加紧侵略越南和包围中国的反革命策略。
    评论说，从最近召开的北大西洋公约组织理事会会议发表的公报中，可以清楚地看到“改善东西方关系”是这次会议的注意中心。北大西洋公约组织的主要老板美帝国主义最近正在根据约翰逊的帝修“搭桥”政策，竭力制定“大西洋新策略”。随着苏修领导以更迅速的步伐在国际上推行投降叛卖的方针，在国内复辟资本主义，把同美国的反革命联盟放在一切之上，美帝头子把扩大和发展“东方”和“西方”关系作为这次北大西洋公约组织会议的方针。会议基于这一方针，建议“西方”和“东方”相互均衡地逐渐减少在欧洲的驻军。评论指出，华盛顿宣传机器大肆吹嘘这是“争取欧洲和平的一个重要措施”。
    评论说，但是，这不能掩盖美帝及其同盟者的真正阴谋和企图，它们实际上想以此来加强帝国主义和修正主义的“桥梁”，在欧洲大陆上划分两个“超级大国”的势力范围，镇压革命和进步力量，在苏联和东欧其它修正主义国家中更广泛地进行政治、思想和资本的渗透。另一方面，它们想以此为美帝国主义创造更加有利的条件，把美帝国主义在欧洲的最大部分的军事力量派往亚洲，反对越南人民，反对中华人民共和国，反对亚洲的解放运动。正当美帝国主义在越南南方战场上遭到失败，千方百计加强美苏对革命和社会主义事业的坚定战士——人民中国的军事包围的时候，美帝国主义者十分关心继续把它们的武装部队从欧洲调往亚洲。
    评论最后说，全世界革命力量面对这一形势正在得出相应的结论，提高警惕，更加紧密地团结自己的队伍，为反对帝国主义及其走狗的新的侵略计划而斗争。在革命和反帝力量的解放斗争的烈火中，帝国主义正在越来越深地陷入危机。帝国主义内部矛盾也正在加深。
