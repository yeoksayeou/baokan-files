The Revolutionary Committee of Bengbu Hemp Textile Mill in Anhui, with the assistance of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support personnel stationed at the mill, has fully mobilized the masses, intensively grasped class struggle, and conducted a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism. This has greatly stimulated the socialist production enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers, promoting rapid development in production. Since the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee in March, the mill's production has risen monthly. In May, the mill's total production value increased by 51% compared to April.

    蚌埠麻纺织厂生产月月上升
    安徽蚌埠麻纺织厂革命委员会在驻厂人民解放军支左人员的帮助下，充分发动群众，狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，极大地调动了广大职工社会主义生产积极性，促进了生产的迅速发展。这个厂自三月份成立革委会以来，生产月月上升，五月份全厂生产总值比四月份增长了百分之五十一。
