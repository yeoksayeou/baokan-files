Chen Wangcai, a student at Tonghua Normal School in Jilin who is responsible for repairing broadcasting equipment, is a leader of a mass organization. When the school's revolutionary committee was established, he was not elected as a member, which caused him to develop a knot in his thoughts. As a result, when the broadcasting equipment malfunctioned, he also stopped maintaining it.

To address this issue, the stationed People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team visited Chen to have a heart-to-heart talk, aiming to help him untie the knot in his thoughts. However, Chen merely used the excuse that the machine was old and needed to be replaced. He also demanded that the revolutionary committee send someone to take over his work. Clearly, the malfunction was with the broadcasting equipment, but the problem lay in Chen's mind.

Not long after, Chen Wangcai participated in a Mao Zedong Thought study class. In the class, the propaganda team helped him repeatedly study the "Three Articles" and Chairman Mao's teachings on "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism." A bright sun illuminated Chen's soul, and the towering figure of Zhang Zide stood before his eyes. Chen's mind was not at peace, thinking, "Comrade Zhang Zide was an old Red Army soldier who followed Chairman Mao on the Long March and made immortal contributions to the liberation of the Chinese people; yet under the guidance of Chairman Mao's thought of 'serving the people wholeheartedly,' he did whatever the Party asked him to do, and became a squad leader and then went to burn charcoal. But I, because I was not elected to the committee, felt ashamed and did not even want to repair the broadcasting equipment." Thinking of this, Chen broke out in a cold sweat, feeling that his selfishness was too heavy!

Red Guards who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. Chen Wangcai said in the study class: "The revolutionary masses in the revolutionary struggle have only the duty to contribute everything, and no right to gain any personal interests. But I, because I was not elected to the revolutionary committee, felt 'disgraced' and 'rebelled in vain,' and wanted to throw down my burden. This is being captured by bourgeois thoughts!" Then Chen clenched his fist and stood in front of Chairman Mao's portrait to express his determination: "I will be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, and on my work post, be a revolutionary screw, not for fame or profit, and wholeheartedly serve the people to achieve new merits!"

Chen Wangcai eliminated the "selfishness" in his thoughts, returned to the broadcasting room, and quickly eliminated the machine's malfunction. From then on, Chairman Mao's voice and the voice of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao were broadcast in Tonghua Normal School in a timely manner.

    先要排除思想“故障”
    吉林通化师范学校负责维修广播器的陈望才同学，是一个群众组织的头头。在学校成立革命委员会的时候，由于没有选上革命委员会成员，思想上结了疙瘩，广播器出了故障，也撒手不管了。
    为了这件事，驻校解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的同志，去找小陈谈心，帮助他解开疙瘩。不料，小陈却借故说，机器老了，该换新的。还要求革委会派人来接替他的工作。很明显，故障出在广播器上，问题却在小陈的脑子里。
    不久，陈望才参加了毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里，宣传队的同志帮助他反复学习“老三篇”，学习毛主席“要斗私，批修”的教导。一轮红日照亮了小陈的灵魂深处，张思德的高大形象，矗立在他眼前。小陈脑子里很不平静，心想，张思德同志是跟随毛主席长征的老红军，为中国人民的解放事业立下了不朽功勋；可是他在毛主席的“全心全意地为人民服务”的思想指引下，党叫干啥就干啥，当了班长又去烧木炭。而自己因为没有当上委员，就觉得不光彩，连修理广播器这样的工作也不想干了。想到这里，小陈捏了一把冷汗，感到自己的私字太重了！
    无限忠于毛主席的红卫兵，最听毛主席的话。陈望才在学习班上说：“无产阶级革命派在革命斗争中，只有贡献自己一切的义务，没有从中捞取一点个人私利的权利。可是自己呢，由于没被选进革委会，就觉得‘不光彩’，‘白造反’，想撂挑子了。这是当了资产阶级思想的俘虏啊！”接着小陈握紧拳头，站在毛主席像前表示决心说：“我要无限忠于毛主席，在自己的工作岗位上，做一颗革命的螺丝钉，不为名，不为利，全心全意为人民立新功！”
    陈望才斗掉了“私”字，回到广播室，很快就排除了机器的故障。从此，毛主席和以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的声音，又在通化师范学校及时地播送开了。
