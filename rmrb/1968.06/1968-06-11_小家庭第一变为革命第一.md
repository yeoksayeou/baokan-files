	From "Small Family First" to "Revolution First"

	The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai have been vigorously promoting the revisionist fallacy that "housewives taking care of children and managing the household is revolution." Coupled with the influence of old habits, some family members of workers have been confined to the small family circle. Some retired workers have also been affected by this ideology, spending their days sitting in teahouses and idling away their time in retirement. The alleyway study class addressed this phenomenon by organizing everyone to study Chairman Mao's teaching: "You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." They fiercely criticized the revisionist poison of "being a peaceful resident" spread by the Chinese Khrushchev's agents in Shanghai. Everyone began to pay attention to state affairs. A worker's wife, who used to hope for a higher salary and more bonuses for her husband so that their small family could live well, participated in the study class. Through revolutionary criticism and self-reflection, she woke up. From then on, she changed. She economized and used the saved money to buy Chairman Mao's works, sending them to her hometown, and also propagated everywhere, mobilizing everyone to study Chairman Mao's works. She also cared about her husband's progress, encouraging him to grasp the revolution and promote production in the factory.

	Near the alleyway, there is a middle school where the revolutionary great alliance was progressing slowly, and Chairman Mao's directive on "resuming classes and making revolution" could not be implemented. Three retired workers voluntarily organized a small propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought and went to the school to promote the great alliance. They invited teachers to a symposium, but some teachers arrived late. An old worker, seeing this, stood up and said: "We workers in the factory feel that being late by even a minute goes against Chairman Mao's directive of 'grasp revolution, promote production.' You don't care about the cultural revolution in the school, how can you be loyal to Chairman Mao?!" The old worker's speech moved the teachers, and everyone sat down to study Mao Zedong Thought, engage in self-criticism, and criticize revisionism. The revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" were quickly realized.

专栏：在毛泽东思想学习班里

    小家庭第一变为革命第一
    中国赫鲁晓夫和他在上海的代理人，大肆鼓吹“家庭妇女带好孩子，管好家务，就是革命”的修正主义谬论，再加上旧的习惯势力的影响，有些劳动人民出身的家属被束缚在小家庭的圈子里。有的退休工人也受到这种思想的影响，每天坐坐茶馆，消磨时光度晚年。里弄学习班针对这种现象，组织大家学习毛主席“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的教导，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫在上海的代理人的“当太平居民”的修正主义流毒，大家开始关心国家大事了。有一个工人家属，过去希望丈夫工资高，奖金多，小家庭生活好。参加学习班后，通过革命大批判，她猛醒过来。从此，她变了样，省吃俭用，把节约下来的钱，买了毛主席著作，寄到家乡去，并且到处作宣传，动员大家学习毛主席著作。她还关心丈夫的进步，鼓励丈夫在工厂中狠抓革命，猛促生产。
    里弄附近有一所中学，革命的大联合进展迟缓，毛主席关于“复课闹革命”的指示不能落实。三个退休工人自动组织了一个毛泽东思想宣传小分队，去这个学校促进大联合。他们邀请教师开座谈会，有些教师来得很迟。一个老工人看到这种现象，就站起来说：“我们工人在工厂里做工，迟到一分钟就觉得违背了毛主席的‘抓革命，促生产’的指示，你们对学校文化大革命不关心，怎能对得起毛主席？！”这个老工人的发言，感动了老师，大家坐下来学习毛泽东思想，斗私批修，很快实现了革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。
