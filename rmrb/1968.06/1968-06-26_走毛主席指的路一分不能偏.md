The leadership cadre of Wangjiazhuang Production Brigade in Jianggezhuang People's Commune, Laizhou County, Shandong Province, decided to establish a tofu workshop to expand sideline production. At this time, some people said, "Making tofu is a technical job, and piecework can motivate production enthusiasm." Most of the commune members disagreed with this view and advocated for the Dazhai-style work-point system. With the help of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, the brigade leadership cadre seized this active thought and launched a major criticism.

Before the meeting, the brigade leadership cadre first led everyone to study Chairman Mao's great teachings on "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work," and then opened the discussion. Someone said, "Starting from motivating enthusiasm, piecework is more appropriate." Upon hearing this, the old poor peasant Luo Fushan stood up and said:

"Chairman Mao calls on us to organize together. We must think of the collective, strive for the collective, and follow the socialist road with one heart. The Chinese Khrushchev advocates 'three autonomies and one contract,' which is to restore capitalism. We must not be fooled by him and drive the socialist road into reverse." "That's right! The loyalty of us poor and lower-middle peasants is forever with the red sun. We will do as Chairman Mao says." This was the strong voice of the young commune member Wang Chenggang. He raised his fist and said forcefully, like taking an oath, "We will follow the path pointed by Chairman Mao without the slightest deviation."

More and more people spoke up. The head of the Poor Peasants' Association, Zhang Yongfang, eagerly said, "The Chinese Khrushchev's 'three autonomies and one contract' motivates capitalist enthusiasm. The more this enthusiasm, the heavier the private interests, and the more deviated the path. Just take the management of wheat fields as an example. In the past, with 'piecework,' crops were planted and harvested carelessly. This year, through the establishment of Mao Zedong Thought study classes and the struggle against selfishness and revisionism, people's consciousness has been raised, wheat fields are well managed, and a bumper harvest is in sight. Developing the collective economy relies on highlighting proletarian politics, not material incentives. Isn't this obvious?" Then, everyone discussed the issue of the Chinese Khrushchev's black wind. The head of the women's team, Luo Cuifeng, angrily said, "The Chinese Khrushchev is a bloodless executioner. His 'three autonomies and one contract' is a soft knife. We suffered losses because there was a 'private' character in our minds." Everyone decided to fiercely struggle against the 'private' character, strongly criticize the 'revisionist' character, and forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution.

Through this major criticism, the commune members' class struggle awareness and understanding of the two-line struggle were greatly enhanced. They further understood the meaning of farming for the revolution, and the anti-drought and rush-planting efforts were carried out with great enthusiasm.

专栏：革命大批判中的小故事

    走毛主席指的路一分不能偏
    山东牟平县姜格庄公社王家庄大队领导班子，为了扩大副业生产，决定开设个豆腐坊。这时，有的人说：“做豆腐是技术活，包工到人能调动生产积极性。”大多数社员不同意这种意见，主张采用大寨式记工法。大队领导班子在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，抓住这个活思想，展开了大批判。
    会前，大队领导班子首先领导大家学习了毛主席关于“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的伟大教导，然后展开讨论。有人说：“从调动积极性出发，还是包工到人合适。”听了这话，老贫农罗福山霍地站起来说：
  “毛主席号召咱们组织起来，咱们要心往集体上想，劲往集体上使，一个心眼走社会主义道路。中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹‘三自一包’，那是要复辟资本主义，咱决不能上他的当，在社会主义大道上开倒车。”“对！咱贫下中农的忠心永远迎着红太阳，毛主席咋说咱咋办。”这是青年社员王成岗粗壮有力的声音。他把拳头用力一挥，象宣誓似地说：“走毛主席指引的路，一分一度也不能偏。”
    会场上发言的人越来越多。贫协负责人张永方争着说：“中国赫鲁晓夫的
  ‘三自一包’，调动的是资本主义的积极性。这种积极性越大，私心越重，路越斜。就拿麦田管理来说，过去‘包工到人’，庄稼粗种粗打。今年通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，开展斗私批修，人的觉悟提高了，麦田管得好，丰收在望。发展集体经济要靠突出无产阶级政治，不能靠物质刺激，这不是明摆着的吗？”接着，大家又讨论以前中国赫鲁晓夫大刮黑风的问题。妇女队长罗翠花气愤地说：“中国赫鲁晓夫是杀人不见血的刽子手，他的‘三自一包’就是一把软刀子。咱吃亏上当是因为头脑里有‘私’字。”大家决心狠斗“私”字，猛批“修”字，永远跟着毛主席干革命。
    通过这场革命大批判，大大提高了社员的阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争觉悟，进一步懂得了为革命种田的道理，抗旱抢种搞得热火朝天。
