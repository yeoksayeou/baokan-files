The renowned unit for studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's Thought, Hongjing Brigade of Shahe People's Commune in Taicang County, Jiangsu Province, has achieved a significant increase in summer grain production over a large area. The single-unit area yield and total yield of 1,430 mu of summer grain have reached the highest historical records. Wheat and soybeans have increased by about 15% compared to last year.

Since last autumn's sowing, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongjing Brigade have followed Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forgetting class struggle" and closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. They have launched wave after wave of fierce attacks on class enemies and have conducted a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism of the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, such as Liu Shaoqi. They have combined the content of revolutionary criticism with each stage of production activities, criticized and exposed the poison of revisionism, and achieved immediate results. For example, during the summer sowing period, they criticized the revisionist fallacy of "economic leadership" by the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, further consolidating the idea of "farming for revolution," and ensuring that the summer grain was sown abundantly and well. During the winter and spring production this year, they deeply studied Chairman Mao's brilliant thought of "self-reliance," once again criticized the fallacy of "material incentives" by the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, further carried out the learning from Dazhai movement, mobilized the enthusiasm of a wide range of cadres and masses, launched a winter and spring fertilizer accumulation and top-dressing campaign, and solved the problem of top-dressing for summer crops through self-reliance. Female community member Xu Yuying and women's team leader Wang Caie led the way in breaking old customs and became the first pair of women to scoop mud from the ship, setting a good example for all women in Hongjing Brigade.

In the struggle to achieve a bumper harvest of summer crops this year, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Hongjing Brigade have waged a tenacious struggle against nature. During the autumn sowing last year, they persevered through continuous rain, rushed to sow in the rain, and worked day and night to complete the sowing task. Since last winter and this spring, they have encountered a rare drought in history, and a wide range of cadres and masses have fully participated in the anti-drought struggle, ensuring the normal growth of crops.

The revolutionary cadres of Hongjing Brigade, in the struggle to achieve a bumper harvest of summer crops this year, have strictly followed Chairman Mao's great teaching of "not eating the old capital, but creating new merits," always leading the masses in revolution and production. Where the work is hard, they appear there; where there are difficulties, they go there. The brigade leader of the 10th production team, Zhang Bingxing, led the way in breaking the ice and scooping mud from the ship in the freezing cold. The brigade leader, Sun Xiaoguan, discovered that some masses had developed a sense of difficulty towards some poorly growing wheat, and immediately studied measures with the poor and lower-middle peasants, promoted the advanced experience of the 10th production team, and ensured the balanced growth of wheat.

At present, the poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres of Hongjing Brigade, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, are inspired by the news of the unprecedented bumper harvest of summer crops, and are striving with an unceasing revolutionary spirit to strengthen the sowing and management of autumn crops, working hard to achieve an even greater bumper harvest of autumn crops.

    思想革命化　生产开红花
    洪泾大队夏粮作物全面增产
    一千四百多亩夏粮作物单位面积产量和总产量达到历史最高水平
    新华社南京二十日电 著名的活学活用毛泽东思想先进单位江苏省太仓县沙溪公社洪泾大队今年夏粮作物获得大面积均衡增产。一千四百三十亩夏粮作物的单位面积产量和总产量都达到了历史最高纪录。“三麦”、蚕豆普遍比去年增产一成半左右。
    去年秋种以来，洪泾大队贫下中农遵照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，不停顿地向阶级敌人发起了一次又一次的猛烈进攻，对中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派，深入持久地开展了革命大批判。他们把革命大批判的内容和每个阶段的生产活动紧密结合起来，批臭修正主义，肃清其流毒，收到了立竿见影的效果。如在夏熟播种时，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派“经济挂帅”的修正主义谬论，更加巩固地确立起“为革命种田”的思想，保证了夏粮作物种得足，种得好。去冬今春的生产中，他们深入地学习了毛主席“自力更生”的光辉思想，又一次批判了中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派“物质刺激”的谬论，进一步开展了学大寨活动，调动了广大干部和群众的积极性，掀起了冬春积肥、追肥高潮，自力更生地解决了夏熟追肥问题。第一生产队女社员徐玉英和妇女队长王彩娥带头打破旧风俗，第一次下船罱泥，成了洪泾大队的第一对女罱泥手，为全大队妇女树立了好榜样。
    在夺取今年夏熟作物丰收的斗争中，洪泾大队贫下中农和革命干部，同大自然展开了顽强的斗争。去年秋种时，阴雨连绵，他们发扬“愚公移山”的革命精神，冒雨抢种，日夜奋战，终于胜利完成了播种任务。去冬今春以来，又碰到历史上少有的大旱，广大干部和群众又全力投入抗旱斗争，保证了农作物的正常生长。
    洪泾大队的革命干部，在夺取今年夏熟作物丰收的斗争中，坚决遵照毛主席“不要吃老本，要立新功”的伟大教导，时时事事走在群众的前面，带领群众抓革命，促生产。那里工作艰苦，他们就出现在那里；那里有困难，他们就到那里去。第十生产队长张炳兴，在滴水成冰的寒天，带头下船敲冰罱泥；大队长孙小观发现部分群众对一些长势较差的三麦产生了畏难情绪，就立即同贫下中农一起研究措施，推广了第十生产队的先进经验，保证了三麦的平衡生长。
    目前，洪泾大队贫下中农和干部，在毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，在夏熟作物空前大丰收的喜讯鼓舞下，正在以不断革命的精神，大力加强秋熟作物的播种和管理工作，为争取秋熟作物的更大丰收而努力。
