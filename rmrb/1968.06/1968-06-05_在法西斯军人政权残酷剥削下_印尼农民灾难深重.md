Under the brutal exploitation of the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime, the Indonesian peasants are suffering deeply.

According to a report by the New China News Agency from Jakarta: The Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime in Indonesia is carrying out savage fascist rule and cruel feudal exploitation against the broad masses of peasants, causing the Indonesian peasants to suffer deeply.

According to a report in the reactionary Indonesian newspaper *Daily News*, various reactionary authorities in different parts of Java have issued numerous orders and regulations, imposing a multitude of oppressive taxes on the peasants. For example, taxes are levied on the sale of agricultural and sideline products, and even the construction of fish ponds requires payment of taxes. Due to various forms of exploitation and heavy taxation, 85% of the products produced by the peasants are taken away.

According to the April issue of *The Voice of the Indonesian People*, the Indonesian fascist military regime, in order to impose fascist military rule on the countryside, has replaced non-military village heads with military village heads in various parts of Java and established counter-revolutionary landlord armed forces. According to another report in the reactionary Indonesian newspaper *Social Messenger*, village heads of military origin are both military and political leaders of the fascist regime in the countryside and landlords in the villages. They carry out even more brutal feudal exploitation of the peasants. Their land is completely cultivated by the poor peasants through "unpaid labor."

Under the ruthless exploitation of the Indonesian fascist military regime, the situation of the Indonesian peasants is extremely miserable. Currently, rural famines are becoming increasingly severe, and kwashiorkor is spreading. There are cases of people dying from hunger everywhere. According to a report in the Indonesian newspaper *Sea Wave*, in the suburbs of North Kalang, a few upper-class families eat rice, middle-class families eat corn, and the vast majority of poor peasant families do not have a fixed supply of grain and often use banana stems and papaya stems to fill their stomachs. According to another report from the official Indonesian news agency Antara, in a village in the Moewardi Bandung Chati area of West Java, more than 200 people have contracted kwashiorkor. In a village in the Lampung district, 49 people have starved to death.

    在法西斯军人政权残酷剥削下
    印尼农民灾难深重
    据新华社讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权对广大农民进行野蛮的法西斯统治和残酷的封建剥削，使印尼农民蒙受深重的灾难。
    据印尼反动报纸《每日新闻》在一则消息中透露，爪哇各地反动当局的各种机构，炮制许多命令和条例，向农民征收名目繁多的苛捐杂税，如出售农副土产要交土产税，甚至造渔塘也要交纳税款。由于遭受各种剥削和赋税奇重，农民生产的产品的百分之八十五被剥夺了。
    据《印尼人民之声》四月份一期报道，印尼法西斯军人政权为了对农村进行法西斯军事统治，在爪哇各地把非军人乡长普遍换成军人乡长，并建立了反革命的地主武装。另据印尼反动报纸《社会使者报》透露，法西斯军人出身的乡长，既是法西斯军人政权在乡村的军政头目，又是农村的地主，他们对农民进行着更加残暴的封建剥削。他们的土地，完全是用“无偿劳役”的办法，强迫贫农替他们耕种。
    在印尼法西斯军人政权敲骨吸髓的残酷压榨下，印尼农民的处境极为悲惨。目前，农村饥荒越来越严重，饥饿水肿病蔓延，到处有饿死人的现象。据印尼《海涛报》透露，在北加浪岸郊区，少数上层人家吃大米，中层人家吃玉米，广大贫农家庭没有固定的粮食，常以香蕉茎、木瓜茎充饥。另据印尼官方喉舌安塔拉通讯社透露，西爪哇茂物班达尔查蒂区一个乡村，有二百多人患了饥饿水肿病。楠榜县一个村庄就饿死四十九人。
