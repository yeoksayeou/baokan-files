	Brave Hearts Amidst Stormy Seas
	Bacang Farm’s “August 18” Female Fighter Liu Yaqin

	Just like the “good cadre who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line” Comrade Men Hetao and the “model for supporting the left and loving the people” Comrade Li Wenzhong, I truly did “love what Chairman Mao loves, support what Chairman Mao supports, follow Chairman Mao’s instructions, and advance when Chairman Mao waves his hand.” What I will never forget is how he, following the great leader Chairman Mao’s teachings, firmly supported the great fearlessness of the proletarian revolutionary left.

	Inspired by the “January Revolution” storm in Shanghai, our farm’s “August 18” proletarian revolutionary faction seized power from a small clique of capitalist roaders within the farm. Just as we were advancing in victory, a small clique of capitalist roaders within the Qinghai Provincial Party colluded with counter-revolutionary elements, stirring up a counter-revolutionary tide. In an instant, dark clouds rolled, and evil winds howled, and the proletarian revolutionary faction suffered brutal suppression. My husband and I were both labeled as “counter-revolutionaries” and subjected to persecution and surveillance.

	Looking up at the North Star, I thought of Chairman Mao. In those days when dark clouds pressed down like a city about to collapse, we “August 18” fighters day and night longed for the invincible sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought to disperse the clouds and shine upon the Qinghai Plateau!

	One day, the capitalist roaders within the Party dispatched certain bad leaders to call me to the farm headquarters, threatening and berating me, attempting to make me abandon my revolutionary stance. After a head-on struggle, I left the headquarters with a heart full of indignation. At the headquarters gate, I ran into Deputy Political Instructor Men. Deputy Political Instructor Men was our “August 18” confidant. At the critical moment of the power seizure struggle, he had given us tremendous support. Today, seeing my own kin, I had a thousand words I wanted to say to him! But thinking of my current situation, I was afraid of implicating him. Thinking of this, I unconsciously slowed my steps. Deputy Political Instructor Men, as if he had seen through my thoughts, walked towards me without any hesitation, warmly and affectionately comforting me, saying, “Don’t be sad, study Chairman Mao’s works more diligently, and use Mao Zedong Thought to measure everything!” Encouraging me to uphold the truth and persist in the struggle. Deputy Political Instructor Men’s few short words contained such profound proletarian feelings! I couldn’t help but shed tears. I made up my mind to face new battles. It was under Deputy Political Instructor Men’s encouragement that I persisted until the final victory.

	Today, although Deputy Political Instructor Men has left us, his firm proletarian revolutionary stance and his fearless spirit of defending Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line will forever inspire and educate me. I will, for life, like Comrade Men Hetao, bravely stand guard for Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line, fight well, and win well.

    险风恶浪见红心
    巴仓农场“八·一八”女战士　刘雅琴
    “无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部”门合同志和“支左爱民模范”李文忠同志一样，真正做到了“毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进”。使我永远不能忘记的，是他按照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，坚定地支持无产阶级革命左派的大无畏精神。
    在上海“一月革命”风暴的鼓舞下，我们农场“八·一八”无产阶级革命派一举夺了场内一小撮走资派的权。正当我们乘胜前进的时候，青海省党内一小撮走资派勾结反革命分子，掀起了一股反革命逆流。霎时间乌云翻滚，恶风狂啸，无产阶级革命派遭到了残酷镇压。我和我爱人都被打成“反革命”，受到迫害和监视。
    抬头看见北斗星，心里想念毛主席。在那黑云压城城欲摧的日子里，我们“八·一八”战士日夜盼望战无不胜的毛泽东思想的阳光驱散乌云，普照青海高原！
    一天，党内走资派指使个别坏头头，把我叫到场部，又是威胁，又是训斥，妄图让我放弃革命立场。经过一场针锋相对的斗争，我怀着满腔的愤慨离开了场部。在场部门口，迎头碰上了门副教导员。门副教导员是我们“八·一八”的知心人，在夺权斗争的关键时刻，他曾给了我们巨大的支持。今天，见到了自己的亲人，真有千言万语想和他讲啊！可是，想到自己目前的处境，又怕连累了他。想到这里，我不由得放慢了脚步。门副教导员象看透了我的心思一样，他毫无顾虑地大步朝我走来，热情又亲切地安慰我说：“别难过，要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想去衡量一切！”鼓励我坚持真理，坚持斗争。门副教导员短短的几句话，凝聚着多么深厚的无产阶级感情啊！我禁不住热泪夺眶而出。我下定决心，去迎接新的战斗。就是在门副教导员的鼓励下，我坚持到了最后胜利。
    今天门副教导员虽然离开了我们，但是他那坚定的无产阶级革命立场，他那捍卫毛主席革命路线的大无畏精神，却永远鼓舞着我，教育着我。我要终生象门合同志那样，勇敢地为毛主席的革命路线放好哨，站好岗，打好仗。
