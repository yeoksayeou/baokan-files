The sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the vast grasslands. Revolutionary committees have been established throughout the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. This achievement signifies that proletarian dictatorship in the Inner Mongolia region has been strengthened more than ever before, and the unity and solidarity of the socialist motherland have gained a new and important guarantee.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, June 17: Since the establishment of revolutionary committees at various levels in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, they have, with the highest enthusiasm and greatest effort, comprehensively implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. They have led the broad revolutionary masses to launch a fierce attack on the enemies of the proletariat and strive to build revolutionary committees into revolutionary fighting command departments that are forever loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In places and units where power needs to be seized, the principle of revolutionary 'three-in-one combination' must be implemented to establish a temporary power organ that is revolutionary, representative, and has proletarian authority. The name of this power organ is good to be called the Revolutionary Committee." Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions, the proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad revolutionary masses in various parts of Inner Mongolia have risen up to launch a struggle to seize power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the party and have successively established revolutionary committees with a three-in-one combination. Since the establishment of the Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee on November 1, 1967, up to now, all seven leagues and two cities in the region have established revolutionary committees; out of ninety-four banners and counties, ninety-three have established revolutionary committees; at the grassroots level, almost all people's communes and the vast majority of industrial and transportation enterprises and other units have established revolutionary committees. This is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This great achievement declares the complete failure of the evil plot by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Inner Mongolia to restore capitalism and split the unity of the motherland, signifying that proletarian dictatorship in the Inner Mongolia region has been strengthened more than ever before, the northern frontline of the motherland against revisionism has been further consolidated, and the unity and solidarity of the socialist motherland family have gained a new and significant guarantee. This great achievement also signifies that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Inner Mongolia has entered a new stage, showcasing a more brilliant future for the socialist revolution and socialist construction in the autonomous region.

Since the establishment of revolutionary committees at various levels in the autonomous region, they have taken being loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line as their highest requirement, and taken studying, implementing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's instructions as their sacred duty. From the day of their establishment, all levels of revolutionary committees have placed the active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and more important than everything. Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions have been promptly implemented. The broad proletarian revolutionary factions, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres, armed with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, have criticized bourgeois factionalism and anarchism, resolutely opposed right opportunism, right splitism, and right capitulationism, and pushed the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution forward along the direction indicated by Chairman Mao.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a political revolution under the condition of socialism, in which the proletariat opposes the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. It is the continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its led revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Members of revolutionary committees at various levels in the autonomous region, in conjunction with the practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have studied Chairman Mao's great instruction and deeply realized that our struggle against the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Inner Mongolia—the counter-revolutionary revisionist and nationalist splittist clique—is the continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its led revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Although this struggle has already achieved decisive victory, the class enemies are not reconciled to their defeat. They are always on the lookout for opportunities, waiting for the chance to rise again. Therefore, we must remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," continue to firmly grasp the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Members of revolutionary committees at various levels, armed with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, continue to mobilize the masses, organize the masses, and launch fierce attacks on the enemies of the proletariat without interruption. The broad revolutionary masses have directed their struggle against the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Inner Mongolia, conducting in-depth and sustained exposure, criticism, and struggle against them, making the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Inner Mongolia—a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists and nationalist splittists—stink in the eyes of the people throughout the region and completely isolated.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "The basic experience of revolutionary committees is threefold: one is the representative of revolutionary cadres, one is the representative of the military, and one is the representative of revolutionary masses, realizing the revolutionary three-in-one combination. Revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative organs, streamline administration, and organize a revolutionary and mass-linked leading cadre." After Chairman Mao's great instruction was issued, from April to May, revolutionary committees at various levels in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region universally held Mao Zedong Thought study classes to implement Chairman Mao's instruction, promptly putting it into action. More than 200,000 members of revolutionary committees at various levels, revolutionary leading cadres, and leading members of revolutionary mass organizations participated in the study classes. Through serious study, they realized that to build a revolutionary and mass-linked leading cadre, the most fundamental thing is to arm oneself with Mao Zedong Thought and arm the masses with Mao Zedong Thought. Currently, they are vigorously strengthening the leadership of the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. Revolutionary committees at various levels have taken a series of new revolutionary measures in implementing unified leadership, breaking down overlapping administrative organs, streamlining administration, and further strengthening the link with the masses. They are determined to build revolutionary committees into leading cadres that are forever loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, making revolutionary committees advance vigorously on the path of being extremely proletarian and extremely militant.

    毛泽东思想的阳光照亮了辽阔草原
    内蒙古自治区普遍建立革委会
    这一成就标志内蒙古地区无产阶级专政空前加强，社会主义祖国的团结和统一获得新的重要保障
    据新华社呼和浩特十七日电  内蒙古自治区各级革命委员会建立以后，以最高的热情，最大的努力，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，率领广大革命人民群众向无产阶级的敌人猛烈进攻，为把革命委员会建设成为永远忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的革命战斗指挥部而奋斗。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“在需要夺权的那些地方和单位，必须实行革命的‘三结合’的方针，建立一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构。这个权力机构的名称，叫革命委员会好。”内蒙古各地无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，在毛主席光辉指示的指引下，奋起向党内一小撮走资派展开夺权斗争，相继建立起三结合的革命委员会。从去年十一月一日自治区革命委员会建立之后，到现在，全区七个盟、两个市全部建立了革命委员会；九十四个旗、县中，已经有九十三个建立了革命委员会；在基层，几乎所有的人民公社和绝大部分工业交通企业和其他事业单位，都建立了革命委员会。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想和毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。这一伟大成就，宣告了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在内蒙古的代理人妄图在内蒙古复辟资本主义、分裂祖国统一的罪恶阴谋彻底破产，标志着内蒙古地区的无产阶级专政空前加强，祖国北部反修前哨阵地更加巩固，社会主义祖国大家庭的团结和统一获得了新的重大保障。这一伟大成就，也标志着内蒙古的无产阶级文化大革命进入了一个崭新的阶段，展示了自治区社会主义革命和社会主义建设更加灿烂辉煌的前景。
    自治区各级革命委员会建立以后，把忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线作为自己的最高要求，把学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛主席的指示作为自己的神圣职责。各级革命委员会从成立的那天起，就把活学活用毛泽东思想，放在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的地位。毛主席的一系列最新指示及时地得到贯彻执行。广大无产阶级革命派、革命群众和革命干部，以毛主席的最新指示为武器，批判资产阶级派性和无政府主义，坚决反对右倾机会主义、右倾分裂主义、右倾投降主义，推动无产阶级文化大革命沿着毛主席指引的方向胜利前进。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”自治区各级革命委员会成员，结合无产阶级文化大革命的实践，学习毛主席这一伟大指示，深刻地认识到，我们和中国赫鲁晓夫及其在内蒙古的代理人——反革命修正主义、民族分裂主义集团的斗争，就是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续。这一斗争虽然已经取得了决定性的胜利，但是，阶级敌人不甘心自己的失败，他们时时在窥测方向，等待时机，妄图东山再起。因此，我们必须牢记毛主席的“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，继续狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    各级革命委员会成员用毛主席的最新指示武装起来，继续深入地发动群众，组织群众，不停顿地向无产阶级的敌人展开猛烈进攻。广大革命群众把斗争矛头对准中国赫鲁晓夫及其在内蒙古的代理人，对他们展开了深入持久的大揭发、大批判、大斗争，使中国赫鲁晓夫及其在内蒙古的代理人——一小撮反革命修正主义分子、民族分裂主义分子在全区人民心目中臭不可闻，完全陷于孤立。
    毛主席指出：“革命委员会的基本经验有三条：一条是有革命干部的代表，一条是有军队的代表，一条是有革命群众的代表，实现了革命的三结合。革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”毛主席的这一伟大指示发表后，内蒙古自治区各级革命委员会从四月到五月，普遍开办落实毛主席这一指示的毛泽东思想学习班，迅速把毛主席的指示贯彻到行动中去。参加学习班的各级革命委员会、革命领导班子和革命群众组织的领导成员有二十多万人。他们经过认真学习，认识到，要建设一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子，最根本的是要用毛泽东思想武装自己，用毛泽东思想武装群众。目前，他们正大力加强对活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动的领导。各级革命委员会在实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，进一步密切联系群众等方面，采取了一系列新的革命措施。他们决心把革命委员会建设成为永远忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的领导班子，使革命委员会在非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的大道上阔步前进。
