A Dramatic Transformation of an Ordinary Mountain Village

Recording the New People and New Events in Shangshi Brigade During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution

Shangshi Brigade is located in a deep valley at the foot of the Luliang Mountains. Here, during the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao Zedong's thought, tremendous changes have taken place.

"Everything is changing, and the world is in turmoil." Over the past two years, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Shangshi Brigade have thoroughly repudiated the counter-revolutionary revisionist line advocated by China's Khrushchev, and have firmly established Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They have extensively launched a mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao Zedong's thought, and have carried out a prolonged and thorough revolutionary criticism. Shangshi Village has undergone a great transformation: people love Chairman Mao more and more, and hate China's Khrushchev more and more. People have changed, and the land has changed. In this great transformation, many moving stories have emerged.

A Family of Poor Peasants Holds Nearly a Hundred Criticism Meetings

At the eastern end of Shangshi Brigade, there lives an old poor peasant with a family of six. Apart from the old man, Yuan Da-ye, and his son-in-law, Song Li-wang, the old woman, Li Yue-ai, and the daughter, Ding E-jiao, were almost always preoccupied with their small family affairs and paid no attention to state matters. Now, the spiritual outlook of this family has undergone a dramatic change.

One day, after attending the brigade's criticism meeting, Yuan Da-ye thought on his way back: "If we could hold criticism meetings at home, so that my wife and daughter could participate in the criticism and care about state affairs, that would be great!" Upon returning home, he shared this idea with Li Da-ma. Upon hearing this, Li Da-ma said, "Our family is short-handed, as you know. My daughter and I work in the fields, cook, take care of the children, and do needlework. We are busy all day long. How can we find time for criticism?"

Yuan Da-ye, though angry, remained calm. He said, "Let's study Chairman Mao's instructions together." He then recited and explained two passages from Chairman Mao's quotations: "You must care about state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end" and "One of our important tasks on the ideological front now is to carry out a criticism of revisionism." Li Da-ma and Ding E-jiao, after studying Chairman Mao's quotations, felt enlightened. Yuan Da-ye then led the family in recalling past hardships and comparing them with the present.

He started by recounting his own story. Born into a poor peasant family in Henan Province, he grew up in misery and tears. Later, the exploitation by landlords caused him to lose his spouse, and he fled to Shanxi to escape famine, working as a long-term laborer for landlords and enduring immense suffering. Before Yuan Da-ye could finish his story, Li Da-ma burst into tears, recounting her own bitter history: In the old society, her family was very poor, and she begged for food from door to door. At the age of sixteen, her brother, in desperation, sold her from their hometown in Shaanxi to Shanxi, to a man twenty years her senior. The couple had not been together for a few years when her husband died from poverty and illness. Afterward, she lived with Yuan Da-ye, working tirelessly for the landlords. Ding E-jiao, weeping, added, "It was only after you and Dad got together that you adopted me!" It turned out that E-jiao was also a poor child. Her biological parents were an old poor peasant couple from Jishan County, Shanxi, who, unable to make ends meet, gave E-jiao to Li Da-ma to share some of their burden. As they recalled and compared their past hardships, the entire family wept together. Yuan Da-ye angrily said, "The evil old society ruined our family, and the landlords and rich peasants exploited us to the point of hunger and cold. Yet, China's Khrushchev still talks about 'exploitation having its merits'! This big villain wants to restore capitalism and drag us back to the old society." He then explained how China's Khrushchev had been spreading poison and how the poor and lower-middle peasants of the brigade had been carrying out revolutionary criticism. This raised Li Da-ma and E-jiao's class consciousness and understanding of the line struggle. They eagerly said, "Chairman Mao is absolutely right. We must criticize revisionism and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end! We must never suffer again, and we must never let the landlords and rich peasants oppress us again!" They immediately agreed to Yuan Da-ye's suggestion to establish a family study class and conduct self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. That evening, they held their first family criticism meeting, combining their personal hardships with a fierce criticism of China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary fallacy of "exploitation having its merits."

From then on, the family frequently held family criticism meetings. The western wall was dedicated to revolutionary criticism, and the eastern wall to reflections on studying Chairman Mao's works. The entire family became a classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's thought and a battlefield for revolutionary criticism. Over the past two years, they have held nearly a hundred family criticism meetings, spoken at brigade revolutionary criticism meetings more than thirty times, and written more than thirty criticism articles, fiercely criticizing China's Khrushchev's entire set of revisionist black goods, including "self-management, self-reliance, and self-dependence," "four freedoms," and "material incentives." All the poor and lower-middle peasants in the brigade learn from them, and many have established family study classes and held family criticism meetings. Now, there are more than 150 such families, accounting for half of the total households in the village.

Elderly People Strive to Become "Old Qu Yuan"

Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the supply and marketing cooperative in Shangshi Brigade was often surrounded by a group of white-haired elderly people. After meals, they would bring small stools and tobacco pipes, gather together, talk about the Three Kingdoms, and chat about foreign countries, wasting their days in idle gossip.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the brigade leadership helped these elderly people establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes, inviting them to participate in large and small team revolutionary criticism meetings, guiding them to study the "Three Articles," and leading poor and lower-middle peasant elderly people to recall national hatred and class suffering, greatly raising their class consciousness. Ding Jianxiang, a 68-year-old poor peasant, said, "In the past, I only knew that the current times were better than before and that we could live in peace. If I had any strength left, I would want to open a small plot of land in the valley. Now I realize that I was poisoned by China's Khrushchev. This big villain wants to lead us poor and lower-middle peasants down the dark path. We must care about state affairs!"

This spring festival, 15 elderly people held a study and application meeting for the "Three Articles" in their study class. One of the elderly, wearing old glasses and holding a red "Three Articles," said, "I think that devoting oneself wholeheartedly to the public and everything for the public is a noble person, a pure person; using one's strength to study and apply Chairman Mao's works is a person of virtue, a person who has risen above petty interests; doing good deeds for the collective is a person beneficial to the people." These words opened everyone's minds, and the elderly unanimously proposed forming the "Old Qu Yuan" Combat Team, requesting the brigade leadership to build a road from the bottom to the top of the southern valley, changing the past inconvenient transportation and difficulty in transporting fertilizer and crops in the southern valley.

The 15 elderly people in the "Old Qu Yuan" Combat Team, the oldest being 84 and the youngest 68, requested to build the southern valley road. Their action deeply moved many cadres. However, they were concerned about the elderly's physical condition. After repeated requests from the "Old Qu Yuan," their request was finally approved.

They started right away. On the tenth day of the first month, they received approval, and on the eleventh, they went down to the southern valley. Due to the cold weather, deep valley, and steep slopes, the hoes dug into the hard stone layer, and soil flew everywhere. Their hands were numb from the vibration. After a day's work, they had made little progress, and some team members were discouraged. The next day, the "Old Qu Yuan" held a "Three Articles" study class on the construction site. Shi Sanbao, an 84-year-old, said, "Although this southern valley is steep and high, it will not get any higher. The more we dig, the less there will be. What is there to fear in building a road?" Studying while working, the "Old Qu Yuan" firmly decided to build the road.

One day, the "Old Qu Yuan" Combat Team encountered quicksand and angular stones while building the road. The angular stones could not be dug, and the quicksand could not be blocked, flowing into a large fork. The "Old Qu Yuan" drew strength from the "Three Articles" to overcome difficulties, reciting and chanting inspiring quotations such as "Resolutely carry out the decision, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory" and "Our comrades must see achievements and light in times of difficulty, raise our courage."

The "Old Qu Yuan" studied and applied the "Three Articles," overcoming numerous difficulties and achieving one victory after another. Currently, on the 60-degree slope from the valley bottom to the top, they have excavated more than 3,000 cubic meters of soil and stone, building a smooth road over 500 meters long. The "Old Qu Yuan" meaningfully told the youth, "We are building the 'Dazhai Road.' You must forever follow Chairman Mao and walk the bright path of socialism!"

Children Grow in the Storm of Class Struggle

As soon as you enter the gate of Shangshi Primary School, you can hear the clear voices of students reciting "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and the melodious singing of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" songs. During the Cultural Revolution, the students of Shangshi have diligently studied Chairman Mao's works and actively participated in the village's revolutionary criticism. In the storm of class struggle, they are growing vigorously.

On a day in April, Ding Anqi, a 10-year-old student in the third grade, was cutting grass with other children by the valley side. The intense revolutionary criticism in the village was still fresh in his mind. He thought of his mother's speech at the revolutionary criticism meeting, recalling his grandfather being killed by Japanese devils with a bayonet, his father working as a long-term laborer for landlords, his mother begging for food from door to door, and China's Khrushchev advocating "self-management, self-reliance, and self-dependence," "exploitation having its merits," and "four freedoms," and other counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods. His heart surged with hatred for China's Khrushchev, and he secretly resolved to always listen to Chairman Mao and become a red successor.

Just then, the landlord element Ding Guangxian sneaked out of the village, heading straight for the southern valley. This guy had been frantically engaging in restoration and usurpation activities in recent days, and the revolutionary masses were about to impose dictatorship and struggle against him, but he was now preparing to escape.

Ding Anqi immediately saw through his trick. Ding Anqi, on one hand, told another child to quickly return to the village to report to the brigade, and on the other hand, with deep hatred for the class enemy, bravely went up and blocked Ding Guangxian's path. Ding Guangxian cunningly used various tricks to try to shake off Ding Anqi, but Ding Anqi tightly held on to him, finally waiting for the village militia to arrive and capture the class enemy.

That afternoon, the entire commune held a struggle meeting, struggling against Ding Guangxian. Ding Anqi also spoke at the meeting, engaging in a sharp struggle against the enemy.

The poor and lower-middle peasants all said, "The Cultural Revolution has tempered our next generation. With such successors, we can make the enemy never dare to rise again!"

The "Incurable Disease" of the Southern Valley Becomes "Dazhai Fields"

Shangshi Brigade is an island-shaped village surrounded by three valleys. About four or five miles away, there is a southern valley, five miles long, with ridges and gullies crisscrossing, and a total of 240 acres of land. This valley, whenever it rains heavily in the summer, would wash away a lot of land, causing severe soil erosion. Since the cooperatives, especially since 1958, the commune members had planted more than 30,000 trees in the valley to control soil erosion. However, China's Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist-roaders spread the black wind of "self-management, self-reliance, and self-dependence," and the 30,000 trees were destroyed, turning everything into small plots of land, and soil erosion remained severe. People thought this valley was an "incurable disease."

The surging tide of revolutionary criticism washed away all the filth. The entire set of revisionist black goods, including "self-management, self-reliance, and self-dependence," was swept away. Under Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production" and "learn from Dazhai in agriculture," the poor and lower-middle peasants of Shangshi, in December last year, formed a Dazhai learning professional team and set out for the southern valley, firing the first shot in the battle to control the southern valley.

Red flags flew and songs echoed on the construction site. The soil control professional team, with the valley as their home, held Mao Zedong Thought study classes on the battlefield. In the study classes, they exposed China's Khrushchev's heinous crimes, criticized counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies, and launched a high tide of revolutionary criticism. The team members poured their sky-high enthusiasm, sparked by revolutionary criticism, into controlling the valley, and the project progressed very quickly.

One day, Ding Guiren, the political worker of the soil control professional team, climbed alone to a three-zhang-high half-cliff to pry the soil, and suddenly the cliff collapsed, and Ding Guiren died a glorious death. Ding Guiren showed a high sense of revolutionary responsibility and fearless revolutionary spirit in his work to control the valley. Where there were difficulties, he rushed; where the tasks were arduous, he went. His death made the commune members very sad and also caused some fluctuations in thought. Some people wanted to retreat, and some parents even refused to let their children go down to the valley. What should be done? The construction site study class and the village family study class organized everyone to discuss how to view Ding Guiren's death. In the discussion, everyone seriously studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and fiercely criticized China's Khrushchev's "philosophy of survival." They said, Ding Guiren died for the people's interests, and his death is heavier than Mount Tai. We must learn from Ding Guiren, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of fearing neither hardship nor death, and resolutely carry the battle to control the southern valley to the end. From then on, the number of team members increased from 24 to 50, and the project progress speed also increased by nearly one fold.

From last winter to this spring, the soil control professional team in the southern valley has always been on the battlefield. Now, the entire valley has built five large dams and ten small dams, moving nearly 10,000 cubic meters of soil. The "Dazhai fields" have been repaired, more than 10,000 trees have been planted, one well has been dug, and 12 kilns have been built. People have changed, and the land has been transformed. The "incurable disease" of the southern valley has been cured in the hands of revolutionary commune members armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

    一个普通山村的巨变
    记上市大队在无产阶级文化大革命中的新人新事
    上市大队是位于吕梁山下深沟里的一个普通山村。这里，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，在伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，发生了巨大变化。
    “天翻地覆慨而慷。”两年来，上市大队的贫下中农大破中国赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，广泛开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，深入持久地开展革命的大批判。上市村大变样了：人们更加热爱毛主席，更加仇恨中国赫鲁晓夫，人变了，地也变了。在这巨大变化中，出现了许多动人心弦的故事。
    一个贫农家庭开了近百次批判会
    在上市大队的村东头，住着一位老贫农，全家六口人。他们家除了老汉阮和光和女婿宋黎旺外，老伴李月爱和女儿丁娥姣几乎整天缠在小家庭的圈子里，对国家大事不关心。现在，这家人的精神面貌发生了一个天翻地覆的变化。
    一天，阮大爷参加大队大批判会后，在回来的路上这样想：要是家庭里也能开批判会，让老伴和女儿都参加大批判，都关心国家大事，那该多好！回到家里，他就把这个想法告诉了李大妈。大妈一听，就说：“咱家人手少你是知道的。我娘儿俩下地、做饭、照看孩子、做针线活，一天到晚就忙得够受了，那里还顾得上搞什么大批判啊！”阮大爷听了老伴的话后，虽然窝了一肚子火，但没有发作。他心平气和地说：“咱们共同学习毛主席的指示吧！”于是他就把“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”和“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判”这两段语录背诵了两遍，并且进行了讲解。李大妈和丁娥姣学了毛主席语录，心里亮堂了。阮大爷接着就引导全家人开展忆苦思甜活动。
    他先由自己讲起。他生在河南省一个贫农的家里，从小在苦里泪里长大。后来，地主的剥削使他失去了爱人，到山西逃荒，给地主扛长活度日，受尽了折磨。他的苦水还没有倒完，李大妈就掉下了眼泪，她也诉起了自己的血泪史：旧社会，她家穷得很，整天沿门要饭。十六岁那年，她哥哥为了活命，忍痛把她由陕西老家卖到山西，找下个比她大二十几岁的受苦人。夫妻过了没有几年，丈夫就在贫病交加中死了。以后，她和阮大爷过到一起。整日累死累活地给地主干活。女儿娥姣哭着给妈妈补充说：“就是你和爸爸过到一起后，才收养的我呀！”原来娥姣也是个苦仁仁。她的生身父母是山西稷山县的一个老贫农，因为生活实在过不下去了，才把娥姣给了李大妈作女儿，分担自己的一些痛苦。回忆对比进行到这里时，全家哭成了一个声。阮大爷愤怒地说：“万恶的旧社会害得我们家破人亡，地主富农剥削得我们饥寒交迫。可是，中国赫鲁晓夫还说什么‘剥削有功’呢！这个大坏蛋还要大搞资本主义复辟，把我们往旧社会引。”接着，阮大爷就把中国赫鲁晓夫这些年来是如何放毒的，现在大队的贫下中农又是如何开展革命大批判的讲了一遍。这下，李大妈和娥姣的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟提高了。她们摩拳擦掌地说：“毛主席说的千真万确，就是要批判修正主义，就是要把文化大革命进行到底！决不能再受二遍苦，决不能让地主富农再来压迫我们！”她们立刻同意了阮大爷办家庭学习班、进行斗私批修的建议。这天晚上，他们一家就结合个人的苦史，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的“剥削有功”的反革命谬论。
    从此，他们家经常开展家庭大批判，西墙上是革命大批判专栏，东墙上是学习毛主席著作心得栏。整个家庭成了活学活用毛泽东思想的课堂，成了革命大批判的战场。两年来，他们共进行了九十多次家庭批判会，在大队革命大批判大会上发言三十多次，写批判文章三十多篇，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“物质刺激”等一整套修正主义黑货。全大队的贫下中农都向他们学习，纷纷办起家庭学习班，举办家庭批判会。现在，这样的家庭已有一百五十户，占全村总户数的一半。
    老年人争当“老愚公”
    无产阶级文化大革命前，上市大队的供销点门前经常聚集着一伙白发苍苍的老人。每当饭后，他们就一手提着小板凳，一手提着旱烟锅凑到一起，说三国，道列国，日子都消磨在闲聊上去了。
    无产阶级文化大革命中，上市大队领导班子帮助这些老年人办起了毛泽东思想学习班，吸收他们参加大、小队的革命批判会，辅导他们学习“老三篇”，引导贫下中农出身的老年人忆民族恨、阶级苦，使他们的阶级斗争觉悟大大提高。六十八岁的老贫农丁健祥说：“过去我只知道现在的世道比过去好多了，能过安然光景。有一点气力，还想到沟里开一片小块地。现在才知道自己中了中国赫鲁晓夫的毒，这个大坏蛋还想把咱贫下中农往黑路上引，咱可不能不关心国家大事啊！”
    今年春节，十五位老年人在学习班开活学活用“老三篇”讲用会，其中一位老年人戴着老花镜，手举着红彤彤的“老三篇”说：“我看，一心为公，一切为公就是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人；把劲用在活学活用毛主席著作上，就是一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人；为集体争办好事，就是一个有益于人民的人。”这一席话开了大家的心窍，老人们一致提出组成
  “老愚公”战斗队，向大队领导班子要求在南沟沟底修一条通向沟顶的大路，改变过去南沟交通不便，拉肥运庄稼很困难的状况。
      “老愚公”战斗队里的十五位老年人，最大的八十四岁，最小的六十八岁。他们请求修南沟路的行动，使许多干部深受感动。但又担心他们身体吃不消，在“老愚公”的再三请求下，终于批准了他们的要求。
    说干就干。正月初十批准，十一日就下到南沟。因为天寒地冻，沟深坡陡，镢头刨在干硬的石料层上，土花飞蹦，两手的虎口也震得发疼。干了一天没干出个眉目，个别队员有些泄气了。第二天，“老愚公”们在工地上办起了“老三篇”学习班，八十四岁的老人石三保说：“咱这南沟虽然很陡，很高，却是不会再增高了，挖一点就会少一点，路有什么修不成呢？”边干边学，“老愚公”坚定了修路的决心。
    一天，“老愚公”战斗队在修路中遇到了流沙和料角石。料角石刨不动；流沙堵不住，一流就是一个大岔。“老愚公”又从“老三篇”中吸取了战胜困难的力量，一边刨，一边朗诵“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”和“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气”等激励人心的光辉语录。
      “老愚公”们活学活用“老三篇”，克服了重重困难，取得了一个个胜利。目前，在由沟底到沟顶的六十度的斜坡上，挖了土石方三千余方，修成了一条长达五百余米的平展展大路。“老愚公”们意味深长地对青年们说：“我们开的是‘大寨路’，你们要永远跟着毛主席走社会主义的光明大道！”
    儿童们在阶级斗争中成长
    一跨进上市小学的校门，就可以听到小学生们读《毛主席语录》的朗爽声音，听到他们唱毛主席语录歌的嘹亮歌声。在文化大革命中，上市的小学生们努力学习毛主席著作，积极参加村里的革命大批判。在阶级斗争的暴风雨中，他们正在茁壮地成长。
    四月的一天，三年级学生、十岁的丁安启正在沟沿上和其他小朋友一起割草。头些天，村中革命大批判的热烈情景还在他的小小的头脑中翻腾。他想起妈妈在革命大批判会上的发言，回忆着爷爷被日本鬼子用刺刀杀死、父亲给地主做牛做马扛长工、妈妈沿门乞讨……，又想着中国赫鲁晓夫提倡推行“三自一包”、“剥削有功”、“四大自由”等反革命修正主义的黑货，心中涌出了一股对中国赫鲁晓夫的恨，暗暗下定决心要永远听毛主席的话，做一个红色的接班人。
    正在这时，富农分子丁光显鬼鬼祟祟地由村中窜了出来，直奔南沟。这个家伙近些日子来一直在猖狂地进行翻案复辟活动，革命群众正要对他进行专政和斗争，而他现在却准备逃跑了。
    丁安启一下就识出了他的诡计。丁安启一方面叫另一个小朋友赶紧回村报告大队，一方面怀着对阶级敌人的深仇大恨，勇敢地上去，挡住了丁光显的去路。丁光显狡猾地用各种花招想把丁安启撇开，但是丁安启紧紧缠住他不放，终于等来了村中的民兵，把这个阶级敌人抓起来了。
    当天下午，全公社就开了斗争大会，斗争了丁光显，丁安启也在大会上发言，向敌人进行了针锋相对的斗争。
    贫下中农都说：“文化大革命锻炼了我们的下一代，有了这样的接班人，我们就可以叫敌人永世不得翻身！”
    “不治之症”的南沟变成了“大寨田”
    上市大队是个三面环沟的岛形村庄。离村四、五里有条南沟，沟长五里多，坡梁纵横，沟岔交错，共有土地二百四十余亩。这条沟过去一遇夏季暴雨就要冲刷好多土地，水土流失相当严重。合作化以来，特别是一九五八年以来，社员为了治沟，在沟里栽了三万多株树。但是中国赫鲁晓夫等一小撮走资派大刮“三自一包”的黑风，三万多株树给刮跑了，到处成了小块地，水土流失依然严重。人们认为这沟是患了“不治之症”。
    革命大批判的滚滚洪流，荡涤着一切污泥浊水。“三自一包”等一套修正主义黑货给冲垮了。上市的贫下中农在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”、“农业学大寨”的伟大号召之下，于去年十二月，组成了学大寨专业队，开赴南沟，打响了根治南沟的第一炮。
    工地上红旗飘扬，歌声回荡，治沟专业队以沟为家，在战地办起了毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里，他们大揭中国赫鲁晓夫的滔天罪行，大批反革命修正主义谬论，掀起了革命大批判高潮。队员们把在革命大批判中焕发出来的冲天干劲使到治沟上，工程进展得非常快。
    一天，治沟专业队的政治工作员丁贵仁同志独身爬到三丈高的半崖上去撬土，突然悬崖倒塌，丁贵仁同志光荣牺牲了。丁贵仁同志在治沟劳动中表现了高度的革命责任感和大无畏的革命精神。那里有困难，他就往那里跑；那里任务艰巨，他就到那里去。他的死使社员们很悲痛，同时也引起了一些思想波动。有些人要退坡，还有些家长干脆不让自己的孩子下沟去。怎么办呢？工地学习班和村里的家庭学习班就组织大家讨论如何对待丁贵仁同志的死？讨论中，大家反复认真地学习了《为人民服务》，狠狠地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的“活命哲学”。他们说，丁贵仁同志是为人民利益而死的，他的死是比泰山还要重的。我们一定要向丁贵仁同志学习，发扬一不怕苦，二不怕死的革命精神，坚决把治理南沟的战斗进行到底。打这以后，专业队的人数由二十四人猛增为五十人，工程进展速度也提高了将近一倍。
    从去冬到今春，南沟的治沟专业队始终坚守战场。现在，全沟已打起了五条大坝，十条小坝，动了土方近万方。整修“大寨田”二百四十亩，栽树一万余株，打井一眼，打窑十二孔。人变思想地换装。南沟的“不治之症”，在毛泽东思想武装起来的革命社员手中被根治了。
