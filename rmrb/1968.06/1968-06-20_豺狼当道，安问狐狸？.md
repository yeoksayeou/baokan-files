    Wolves on the road, who cares about foxes?

    In today's Soviet Union, embezzlement, theft, and speculation are rampant. This increasingly serious phenomenon is something that even the propaganda machine of the Soviet revisionist renegade clique cannot conceal.

    Theft and embezzlement are inevitable products of capitalist society. The great Lenin once pointed out: "The rich and the swindlers are two sides of the same medal; these are two kinds of parasites bred by capitalism." The life philosophy of the bourgeoisie is to seek profit at all costs. In their view, to obtain money, one can invest for profit, exploit for wealth, or engage in speculation and embezzlement. As long as the methods are "clever" and the actions are "smooth," anything goes. Therefore, after the victory of the October Revolution, Lenin repeatedly emphasized that the Soviet government must resolutely eliminate these "epidemics and ulcers" left over from capitalism; otherwise, it would be helping the enemy to sabotage the socialist system.

    The Soviet revisionist renegade clique has usurped power and is fully restoring capitalism in the Soviet Union. Naturally, this "epidemic" will spread widely, and this "ulcer" will inevitably worsen rapidly. Moreover, the Soviet revisionist renegades openly advocate "money first" and implement a so-called "new system" that actually encourages speculation. Under these circumstances, how can corruption and bribery not become the daily routine of those new bourgeois elements?

    The Soviet revisionist renegade clique is trying hard to put on a show of maintaining "law and order." However, everyone knows that they themselves are the biggest theft gang in today's Soviet Union. This small clique of the bourgeois privileged class shamelessly plunders the fruits of labor of the broad masses of the people and lives a life of extreme luxury by exploiting the sweat and blood of the working people. It is precisely under their patronage and protection that the big and small officials who have usurped various levels of leadership positions dare to brazenly misuse public funds for private gain and commit evil deeds.

    In factories or farms, embezzlers who steal tens of thousands of rubles through corruption are, compared to the state thieves in the Kremlin, merely "small fry" compared to "big fish."

    The matter is clear: to eliminate embezzlement, theft, and speculation in the Soviet Union, one must first overthrow the reactionary rule of the Soviet revisionist renegade clique. Otherwise, wolves on the road, who cares about foxes?

    豺狼当道，安问狐狸？
    在今日的苏联，贪污盗窃、投机倒把成风。这种日益严重的现象，连苏修叛徒集团的宣传机器也无法隐讳了。
    盗窃侵吞是资本主义社会的必然产物。伟大的列宁曾经指出：“富人和骗子是一枚奖章的两面，这是资本主义豢养的两种寄生虫”。资产阶级的人生哲学就是唯利是图。在他们看来，为了弄到金钱，既可以投资盈利，剥削发财，也不妨投机倒把，贪污盗窃，只要手段“高明”，干得巧妙。因此，在十月革命胜利以后，列宁就一再强调，苏维埃政权必须坚决清除这些由资本主义遗留下来的“瘟疫和溃疡”，否则就是帮助敌人破坏社会主义制度。
    苏修叛徒集团篡夺了政权，在苏联全面复辟资本主义，这种“瘟疫”自然要大大地流行起来，这种“溃疡”不可避免地要急剧恶化。况且苏修叛徒公然鼓吹“卢布挂帅”，实行实际上是鼓励投机倒把的所谓“新体制”。在这种情况下，营私舞弊、贪污受贿又怎么能够不成为那些新资产阶级分子的家常便饭呢？
    苏修叛徒集团居然竭力装出要维护“法纪”的样子。但是，谁都知道，他们自己就是今天苏联最大的盗窃集团。这一小撮资产阶级特权阶层，无耻地侵吞广大人民的劳动果实，靠榨取劳动人民的血汗来过其穷奢极侈的生活。也正是在他们的纵容和庇护下，窃据了各级领导职位的大小官员才敢于明目张胆地假公济私，为非作歹。
    在工厂或农庄中靠营私舞弊捞个一万几千卢布的贪污盗窃犯，同克里姆林宫中的窃国大盗相比，不过是“小巫见大巫”罢了。
    事情很明白，在苏联，要消除贪污盗窃、投机倒把等现象，首先就必须推翻苏修叛徒集团的反动统治。否则，豺狼当道，安问狐狸？
