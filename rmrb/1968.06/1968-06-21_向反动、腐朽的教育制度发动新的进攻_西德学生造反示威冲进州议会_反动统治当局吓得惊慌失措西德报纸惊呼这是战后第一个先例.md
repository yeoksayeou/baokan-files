West German students have stormed into the state legislature in a rebellion against the reactionary and decaying education system. The reactionary ruling authorities are in a state of panic, with West German newspapers exclaiming that this is the first such incident since the war.

The wave of protests and strikes by West German students against the current decaying education system continues to rise.

Following the nationwide strike by 65,000 engineering school students on the 11th, in recent days, students in several cities across West Germany have staged powerful demonstrations.

On the morning of the 19th, over 4,000 engineering school students from various parts of Hesse State marched towards the state capital, Wiesbaden, in two large groups. They carried numerous banners and chanted slogans demanding reforms to the decaying education system. In the afternoon, the students gathered in the square in front of the State Education Department to hold a demonstration rally.

On the same day, more than 2,000 engineering school students from Kaiserslautern, Trier, and Oberglenzhausen gathered in Koblenz for a demonstration march.

In Aachen, over 1,000 students from the Education College began a two-day strike on the 19th.

Earlier, more than 10,000 students from 16 engineering schools in Bavaria gathered in the state capital, Munich, to hold a large-scale demonstration march and rally.

Starting in the morning, some students drove a car with a large banner around the city for propaganda. Others dressed in old-fashioned uniforms and hats, symbolizing the decaying education system, and carried umbrellas, holding a mock parade to express their protest against the current education system. In the afternoon, the demonstrating students gathered in the square next to the State Education Department for a mass meeting, denouncing the decaying education system, outdated teaching content, and teaching methods. The meeting was filled with giant banners waving in the wind and slogans echoing, with the crowd's emotions running high. The students' struggle received the support of the workers in Bavaria.

In addition, in recent days, 500 and 2,000 engineering school students in Kassel and Lower Saxony, respectively, held strikes and demonstration marches.

In the state capital of North Rhine-Westphalia, Düsseldorf, over 200 engineering school and economics students stormed the state legislature on the 12th, occupying the front hall and presenting their protests to the governor in attendance. The students' brave action caused the authorities to panic, quickly mobilizing a large number of fully armed police to suppress the students.

West German newspapers, in reporting the students' occupation of the state legislature, exclaimed that this was the first such incident since the war. In the afternoon of the same day, the students held a demonstration march in the city. The demonstrating students also burned a car and dragged the wreck to the doorstep of the State Education Minister's home to protest.

On the same day, more than 7,000 students from 21 economics colleges and specialized economics schools across West Germany held a nationwide strike. Students from the economics colleges in North Rhine-Westphalia and Bavaria, like those in the engineering schools in these two states, announced an indefinite strike.

    新华社波恩十九日电　西德学生为反对西德现行腐朽教育制度而掀起的示威和罢课斗争浪潮正在继续高涨。
    继六万五千名工程学校学生十一日举行全国性大罢课之后，连日来西德又有不少城市先后爆发了学生的强大示威。
    十九日清晨，来自黑森州各地的四千多名工程学校学生，分成两路大军向这个州的首府威斯巴登浩浩荡荡地前进。他们举着无数标语牌，沿途高呼要求改革腐朽教育制度的口号。下午，学生们汇集在州教育部前面的广场上举行了示威集会。
    同一天，来自凯撒斯劳滕、特里尔、上格伦茨豪森等地的工程学校学生两千多人，在科布伦茨举行示威游行。
    在亚琛市，一千多名教育学院学生也在十九日开始了为期两天的罢课斗争。
    在这以前，巴伐利亚州十六所工程学校的一万多名学生，十八日汇集到这个州的首府慕尼黑，举行了声势浩大的示威游行和集会。
    从上午开始，一部分学生就开着挂有巨幅标语的广播车在市内进行宣传。一些学生则穿戴着象征腐朽教育制度的古老礼服和礼帽，手里拿着阳伞，举行了化装游行，以表示他们对现行教育制度的抗议。当天下午，示威学生聚集在州教育部旁的广场上举行了大会，声讨腐朽的教育制度、陈旧的教学内容和教学方法。会场上无数巨幅标语迎风招展，口号声此伏彼起，群情激愤昂扬。学生们的斗争得到了巴伐利亚州工人的支持。
    另外，这几天在卡塞尔市和下萨克森州也分别有五百名和两千名工程学校学生举行了罢课和示威游行。
    在北来因—威斯特伐利亚州的首府杜塞尔多夫，两百多名工程学校和经济学院学生，十二日曾经一度冲进州议会，占领了议会前厅，向正在列席会议的州长提出了抗议。学生们这一英勇行动使当局惊慌失措，赶忙调集了大批全副武装的警察来镇压学生。
    西德报纸在报道学生占领州议会的行动时，惊呼这是开了战后以来的第一个先例。当天下午，学生们在市内举行示威游行。示威学生还烧毁了一辆汽车，并拖着这辆破车来到州教育部长的家门前示威。
    也在同一天，西德二十一个经济学院和经济专科学校的七千多名学生举行了全国性罢课。北来因—威斯特伐利亚州和巴伐利亚州经济学院的学生，同这两个州工程学校的学生一样，宣布举行无限期罢课。
