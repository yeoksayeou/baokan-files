The Arab people's just struggle against American imperialism and its lackey, Israel, is deepening. In particular, the Palestinian people are persistently waging a revolutionary armed struggle against Israel to achieve national liberation. Palestinian guerrillas are roaming the vast rural and mountainous areas of Arab territories occupied by Israel and areas under Israeli rule, continually striking at the Israeli invaders, boosting the Arab people's fighting spirit and confidence in victory.

One year ago today, Israel, under the planning and support of American imperialism, brazenly launched an aggressive war against Arab countries. American imperialism, through its tool of aggression, Israel, attempted to use force to conquer the Arab people, control and enslave the various Arab countries, maintain and expand its exploitation of this region, especially to extract huge oil profits, and further implement the United States' new colonialist expansion plan. Although the Arab countries suffered a temporary setback in this war, the American-Israeli aggressors did not succeed in subduing the Arab people. On the contrary, the aggressive war launched by the Americans and Israelis has further united the Arab people in the face of their ferocious national enemy, launching a heroic struggle.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out, "War educates the people." The war that broke out in the Middle East a year ago awakened the Arab people, tempered the Arab people, greatly raised the political awareness of the Arab people, and greatly aroused the revolutionary spirit of the Arab people.

Through this war, the Arab people have seen more clearly that American imperialism is their number one enemy. American imperialism, in order to enslave and plunder the peoples of various Arab countries, is crazily pushing its new colonialist policy in the Middle East. When its political means fail, it brazenly launches armed aggression. The peoples of various Arab countries, in order to struggle for and maintain national independence, must engage in long-term, repeated struggles and confrontations with American imperialism and its lackeys.

Through this war, the Arab people have also seen more clearly the ugly face of the Soviet revisionist renegade clique. The Soviet revisionists committed a series of treacherous acts against the Arab people during last year's Middle East war, playing the shameful role of strangling the Arab people's anti-imperialist struggle. After the Glassboro talks, the Soviet revisionists and American imperialists further colluded, plotting a grand conspiracy to force Arab countries to kneel and surrender to the American-Israeli aggressors. On the one hand, the Soviet revisionists colluded with American imperialism in the United Nations to concoct the so-called "political resolution" to the Middle East problem, openly pressuring Arab countries to accept humiliating conditions, recognize the results of Israel's aggression, and attempting to force the Arab people, especially the Palestinian people, to lay down their arms and stop their struggle against imperialism and its lackeys. On the other hand, they are using the pretext of "supporting" and "aiding" Arab countries to attempt to control and plunder Arab countries politically, militarily, and economically. This fully exposes the Soviet revisionist renegade clique as a pack of wolves in sheep's clothing.

Through this war, the broad masses of the Arab people have realized that to defeat the American imperialists and their lackey, Israel, who are armed to the teeth, they must widely mobilize, organize, and arm themselves, and persist in a long-term people's armed struggle. The fact that the Palestinian guerrillas have struck fear into the hearts of the Israeli aggressors once again proves that people's war is the magic weapon for oppressed nations and peoples to defeat their enemies and achieve liberation.

Our great teacher Chairman Mao teaches: "Oppressed peoples and oppressed nations can never entrust their liberation to the 'wisdom' of imperialism and its lackeys, but only through strengthening unity and persisting in struggle can they achieve victory."

The contradictions between the Arab people and the old and new colonialists led by the United States and their lackeys are irreconcilable. Currently, the Israeli aggressors are continually launching military provocations, exerting military pressure on Arab countries, attempting to divide the Arab countries, and extinguish the armed struggle of the Palestinian people. The peoples of various Arab countries are closely watching and vigilantly guarding against the conspiracy of a so-called "political solution" by the Americans and Soviet revisionists; at the same time, they are prepared at any moment to smash any new military adventures that the Israeli aggressors might launch. This requires the peoples of various Arab countries to closely unite, jointly confront the enemy, continuously strengthen the people's anti-imperialist armed forces, and deal heavier blows to the Israeli aggressors.

The current international situation is excellent. National liberation movements are flourishing in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and mass revolutionary struggles are surging in Europe and North America. Imperialism led by the United States is in an increasingly dire situation, and American imperialism is in a state of internal and external difficulties, in a state of panic. The counter-revolutionary face of the Soviet revisionist renegade clique, which acts as an accomplice to American imperialism, is also increasingly exposed. The development of the entire international situation is very favorable to the peoples of various Arab countries and very unfavorable to American imperialism and its lackeys. The Chinese people firmly support the just struggle of the Arab people. We are convinced that as long as the Arab people strengthen their unity and persist in struggle, they will surely overcome all difficulties and achieve final victory in their anti-imperialist struggle.

    加强团结、坚持斗争，就能赢得胜利

    阿拉伯人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗以色列侵略的正义斗争，正在深入发展。特别是巴勒斯坦人民，正在坚持进行反对以色列、争取民族解放的革命武装斗争。巴勒斯坦游击队驰骋在以色列占领的阿拉伯领土以及以色列统治区的广大农村和山区，给予以色列侵略者以不断的打击，鼓舞着阿拉伯人民的斗争意志和胜利信心。
    一年前的今天，以色列在美帝国主义的策划和支持下，悍然对阿拉伯国家发动了侵略战争。美帝国主义通过它的侵略工具以色列，妄想用武力征服阿拉伯人民，控制和奴役阿拉伯各国，维护和扩大它对这个地区的剥削，特别是榨取巨额石油利润，进一步推行美国的新殖民主义扩张计划。尽管阿拉伯国家在这场战争中遭到了暂时的挫折，但是美以侵略者并没有能够压服阿拉伯人民。恰恰相反，美以发动的侵略战争，使阿拉伯人民在凶恶的民族敌人面前进一步团结起来，展开了英勇的斗争。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席曾经指出，“战争教育了人民”。一年前在中东爆发的战争，唤醒了阿拉伯人民，锻炼了阿拉伯人民，大大提高了阿拉伯人民的政治觉悟，大大激发了阿拉伯人民的革命斗志。
    通过这场战争，阿拉伯人民更加看清了美帝国主义是他们的头号敌人。美帝国主义为了奴役和掠夺阿拉伯各国人民，在中东疯狂地推行新殖民主义政策。当它的政治手段不能得逞时，它就悍然发动武装侵略。阿拉伯各国人民要争取和维护民族独立，就必须同美帝国主义及其走狗进行长期的反复的斗争和较量。
    通过这场战争，阿拉伯人民也进一步看清了苏修叛徒集团的丑恶嘴脸。苏修在去年的中东战争中，干下了一连串出卖阿拉伯人民的罪恶勾当，充当了扼杀阿拉伯人民反帝斗争的可耻角色。葛拉斯堡罗会谈之后，苏修美帝之间进一步狼狈为奸，策划了逼迫阿拉伯国家向美以侵略者屈膝投降的大阴谋。苏修一方面串通美帝国主义在联合国炮制了所谓“政治解决”中东问题的“决议”，公然对阿拉伯国家施加压力，要他们接受丧权辱国的条件，承认以色列的侵略结果，并且企图迫使阿拉伯人民特别是巴勒斯坦人民放下武器，停止反对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争。另一方面它又打着“支持”和“援助”阿拉伯国家的幌子，企图从政治、军事、经济等方面，控制和掠夺阿拉伯国家。这就充分暴露了苏修叛徒集团是一伙披着羊皮的狼。
    通过这场战争，广大的阿拉伯人民认识到，要战胜武装到牙齿的美帝国主义及其走狗以色列，就必须广泛地动员起来，组织起来，武装起来，坚持长期的人民武装斗争。巴勒斯坦游击队把以色列侵略者打得胆战心惊，这个事实又一次证明，人民战争是被压迫民族和被压迫人民克敌制胜、赢得解放的法宝。
    我们的伟大导师毛主席教导说：“被压迫人民和被压迫民族，决不能把自己的解放寄托在帝国主义及其走狗的‘明智’上面，而只有通过加强团结、坚持斗争，才能取得胜利。”
    阿拉伯人民同以美国为首的新老殖民主义及其走狗的矛盾是不可调和的。目前，以色列侵略者不断发动军事挑衅，对阿拉伯国家施加军事压力，企图分化阿拉伯国家，扑灭巴勒斯坦人民的武装斗争。阿拉伯各国人民正在密切注视和警惕着美帝、苏修的所谓“政治解决”的阴谋；同时，随时准备粉碎以色列侵略者可能发动的新的军事冒险。这就要求阿拉伯各国人民紧密地团结起来，共同对敌，不断壮大人民反帝武装力量，给予以色列侵略者以更沉重的打击。
    当前的国际形势是一片大好。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族解放运动蓬勃发展，欧洲、北美的群众革命斗争空前高涨，以美国为首的帝国主义处境越来越不妙，美帝国主义更是陷于内外交困、焦头烂额的境地。充当美帝帮凶的苏修叛徒集团的反革命面目也日益暴露。整个国际形势的发展，是十分有利于阿拉伯各国人民而不利于美帝国主义及其走狗的。中国人民坚决支持阿拉伯人民的正义斗争。我们坚信：只要阿拉伯人民加强团结，坚持斗争，就一定能够排除万难，取得反帝斗争的最后胜利。
