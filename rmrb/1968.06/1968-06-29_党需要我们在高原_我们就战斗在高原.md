Where the Party needs us on the plateau, we fight on the plateau. Zhang Baoxian, an active learner of Mao Zedong Thought from the General Logistics Department.

To lure people onto the capitalist road, the Chinese Khrushchev always instills extreme individualism in people. When it comes to work assignments, he advocates, "Do what you want, hope for what you want, and go where you want, as much as possible, accommodate." This is blatantly demanding that the Party serve the individual, which is utterly ridiculous!

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "A Communist Party member should be open-hearted, honest, and active, putting the interests of the revolution as his first priority and subordinating personal interests to the revolutionary cause." The Party's interests concentrate on representing the interests of the broad masses of the people. Putting the Party's interests first and doing whatever the Party asks us to do is the most concrete manifestation of our revolutionary soldiers' wholehearted service to the people.

Our Five-Dao-Liang military supply station is located in a place where snow never melts and the climate is unpredictable, making life extremely difficult. Our comrades at the station understand that the Party has sent us here because it is a revolutionary necessity. Every piece of work we do is connected to defending the country, developing the border, and supporting the world revolutionary struggle. Comrades proudly declare: Wherever Chairman Mao points, we rush; where the Party needs us on the plateau, we fight on the plateau! Even if this place is made of stone, we will take root here! Leaving even a step away is disloyalty to Chairman Mao and disloyalty to Mao Zedong Thought!

Making the plateau our home is our will, and wholeheartedly doing revolution is our happiness. Over the years, we have wholeheartedly served the passing troops and enthusiastically promoted Mao Zedong Thought. The altitude is high and the oxygen is thin, the labor intensity is great, but with our strong revolutionary will, we have overcome difficulties such as dizziness, palpitations, and shortness of breath. The weather is cold, and for five months of the year, we have to melt ice for water. We brave the bone-chilling wind and go several miles to a lake to chop ice. The struggle is hard, but we are happy in our hearts. We firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching of "completely selfless and dedicated to others" and treat our comrades with extreme enthusiasm. Sometimes, heavy snow blocks the roads, and convoys are stranded, so we carry hot meals and soup in insulated containers and deliver them to our comrades on the snowy mountains. Here, the high altitude makes it impossible to grow vegetables, so we rely on ourselves, growing bean sprouts indoors and making tofu. At first, there were no animals to pull the mill, so everyone pushed the mill together.

Perseverance in struggle is victory. Chairman Mao teaches us: "There are difficulties in front of us, and there are many of them, but we are confident that all difficulties will be overcome by the heroic struggle of the people of the whole country." It is precisely by following Chairman Mao's great teachings that we have persevered through hardships and finally overcome difficulties and achieved victory. At the same time, this has also strengthened our confidence in settling down on the plateau. We have truly tasted the sweetness of suffering for the revolution and the happiness of working for the Party.

Comrade Lin Biao teaches us: "Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman, and doing revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Suffering for the revolution and finding joy in hardship is the result of our active learning and application of Mao Zedong Thought. Only by fighting with Mao Zedong Thought can we thoroughly break down the "self" and establish the "public." We actively learn and apply the "Three Old Articles," deeply burying the bourgeois individualistic thoughts of fearing hardship and death. The more we fight against selfishness, the more we love the plateau. Soldiers who have served beyond their term all voluntarily request to continue working on the plateau. They say: Although our service term is over, the cause of the proletarian revolution is far from complete, and we must fight on the plateau for life! In our hearts, there is a red sun, shining on us as we grow and temper ourselves through hard struggles!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Communist Party members should never put personal interests first, but should subordinate personal interests to the interests of the nation and the people." The Chinese Khrushchev attempts to use "accommodating personal wishes and interests" to incite us not to follow the needs of the revolutionary cause and not to follow the Party's assignments, which is a futile attempt. Every revolutionary must take Chairman Mao's latest instructions of "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline, go to the posts where the Party needs us the most, go to the most difficult places, fear no difficulties, and fight tenaciously to make our contributions to the revolution and the people!

### 党需要我们在高原  我们就战斗在高原

    党需要我们在高原  我们就战斗在高原
    总后勤部学习毛泽东思想积极分子　张宝贤
    中国赫鲁晓夫为了诱骗人们走资本主义道路，总是向人们灌输极端的利己主义思想。在分配工作的问题上，他鼓吹“愿意做什么，希望做什么，愿意到什么地方去，尽可能照顾”。这是明目张胆地要党服从个人，真是岂有此理！
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“一个共产党员，应该是襟怀坦白，忠实，积极，以革命利益为第一生命，以个人利益服从革命利益”。党的利益集中地代表了广大人民群众的利益。把党的利益放在第一位，党叫干啥就干啥，这是我们革命战士全心全意为人民服务最具体的体现。
    我们五道梁兵站驻地，终年积雪不化，气候变化无常，生活十分艰苦。我们兵站的同志们认识到，党把我们派到这里来，这是革命的需要，我们所做的每一件工作都是同保卫国防、建设边疆、支援世界革命斗争联系着的。同志们豪迈地说：毛主席指向那里，我们就奔向那里；党需要我们在高原，我们就战斗在高原！那怕这里是石板，咱们也要把根扎下去！离开一步，就是对毛主席的不忠，就是对毛泽东思想的不忠！
    以高原为家就是我们的志愿，全心全意干革命就是我们的幸福。几年来，我们全心全意地为过往部队服务，满腔热情地宣传毛泽东思想。这里山高氧气少，劳动强度大，我们以坚强的革命意志，战胜头晕、心跳、气喘等困难。这里天寒地冻，一年有五个月要靠挖冰化水，我们顶着刺骨的寒风，到几里以外的湖泊上打冰。斗争虽然艰苦，但是我们乐在心里。我们牢记毛主席“毫不利己专门利人”的教导，极端热忱地对待战友。有时大雪封山，车队受阻，我们便用保温桶盛上饭菜、热汤，抬着送上雪山给战友。这里高寒种菜不成，我们就自力更生，在室内生出豆芽，磨出豆腐。开始磨豆腐没有牲口，大家便一起去推磨。
    坚持斗争就是胜利。毛主席教导我们：“我们面前的困难是有的，而且是很多的，但是我们确信：一切困难都将被全国人民的英勇奋斗所战胜。”我们正是遵照毛主席的伟大教导，艰苦斗争，终于克服了困难，取得了胜利。同时，这也更坚定了我们在高原安家落户的信心。我们真正尝到为革命吃苦的甜头，享到为党工作的幸福。
    林彪同志教导我们：“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。为革命吃苦，以苦为乐，这是我们活学活用毛泽东思想的结果。只有用毛泽东思想去战斗，才能大破“私”字，大立“公”字。我们活学活用“老三篇”，把怕苦、怕死的资产阶级个人主义思想深深地埋葬。我们越斗私，就越热爱高原。超期服役的老战士们都主动要求继续留在高原工作。他们说：服役期虽然满了，但是无产阶级革命事业远远没有完成，我们就是要在高原战斗一辈子！我们心中有颗最红最红的红太阳，照耀着我们在艰苦斗争中锻炼成长！
    毛主席教导我们：“共产党员无论何时何地都不应以个人利益放在第一位，而应以个人利益服从于民族的和人民群众的利益。”中国赫鲁晓夫妄图用照顾
  “个人志愿、兴趣”，煽动我们不服从革命事业的需要，不服从党的分配，这是痴心妄想。我们每个革命者一定要以毛主席的最新指示“斗私，批修”为纲，到党最需要的岗位上去，到最艰苦的地方去，不怕困难，顽强战斗，为革命为人民做出自己的贡献！
