In the glorious Red May, the joyous news of Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao receiving the representatives of the National Railway and Transportation Conference spread to Shanghai. The revolutionary cadres and masses of the Second Loading and Unloading Area of the Shanghai Port Bureau were moved to tears. They made a vow to achieve better results in both revolution and production, to develop the great situation, and to respond to Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin's care and expectations. In this glorious Red May, after continuous efforts, they completed the unloading of 34,000 tons of cargo from a foreign ship in three days and four hours and forty minutes, setting a new record for unloading foreign ships, fulfilling their vow, and making new contributions to the great socialist motherland, adding new luster to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The Powerful Response of the Working Class

In late May, a foreign ship, the "Pantos," arrived at Shanghai Port. This was its second visit to a Chinese port.

To win the battle of unloading, the Revolutionary Committee of the Second Area held a mass rally for "pre-battle mobilization." The broad revolutionary masses decided to unload the 34,000 tons of cargo quickly and well. Immediately, the entire area was filled with a tense yet enthusiastic atmosphere of battle.

Just as the battle was about to begin, the captain of the "Pantos" asked in a doubtful tone, "How long do you plan to unload this time?" Our staff replied, "No more than seven days." The captain was taken aback and shook his head, saying, "Impossible! Impossible! Even the advanced level in Europe takes six days." The boundless creativity of Chinese workers, tempered in the great storms of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao, is beyond his comprehension. However, the workers of the Second Area gave a powerful response: "Europe takes six days, we only need five!"

Class Struggle, Once Grasped, Works Wonders

Just as the revolutionary masses of the entire area were actively preparing to welcome the unloading, a sudden gust of wind blew from the sewers, aiming to sabotage the revolution and production.

Within the Revolutionary Committee of the Second Area, some comrades were also hesitant, fearing that the time was too tight. The Revolutionary Committee of the Second Area, following Chairman Mao's teachings of "never forgetting class struggle" and trusting and relying on the masses, led the masses to further carry out a vigorous revolutionary criticism, exposing the bad elements who attempted to overthrow the revolutionary committee and sabotage the revolution and production.

The Revolutionary Committee of the Second Area also mobilized the masses to criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the port. Through the revolutionary criticism, the difficulties in the minds of the cadres and some outdated rules that constrained the enthusiasm of the masses were further smashed, and the revolutionary and productive enthusiasm of the masses was greatly unleashed.

"Chairman Mao commands us to fight!"

The curtain of a fierce unloading battle was raised.

The revolutionary workers of the Second Area actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's great thoughts on strategy: to despise the enemy strategically and take the enemy seriously tactically. They first made a detailed analysis of this unloading task: the actual load of this ship was 35,000 tons, which was rare in Shanghai Port's unloading operations; it was also the first time it came to Shanghai, and the ship type was unfamiliar, making it difficult to deploy operations. To know the enemy and oneself, before the ship entered the port, they sent "scouts" on board to inspect the "battlefield" and study the deployment of operations on the spot, thus reducing the preparation time before work from the original three hours to one hour.

Time is victory, every second counts. This ship had a deep draft, and according to past practices, it should first anchor outside the mouth of Wusong or in the middle of the Huangpu River and use a barge to unload part of the cargo to reduce the draft, and then berth to unload the cargo. However, doing so would greatly prolong the ship's unloading time. What should be done? The Revolutionary Committee of the Second Area relied on the revolutionary cadres with the most practical experience, presenting the difficulties to the masses. The masses are full of boundless creativity. They analyzed the time of the tide and closely cooperated with the pilot, berthing at high tide and unloading part of the cargo before the tide fell. In this way, they gained more time.

"Everything for Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao commands us to fight!" The wharf was brightly lit, and the workers worked day and night, racing against time. Some old workers stayed on the wharf for three days and nights. Retired workers also came, as did the drivers in the warehouse. Those who should go off duty did not want to hand over their shifts, and those who should go on duty insisted on taking over. The police station stationed in the Second Area and the staff of the Revolutionary Committee of the Second Area also went to the wharf to serve tea and water, participating in the battle. Just as the battle was intense, the oil pipe of a suction dredger suddenly clogged. Should the machine be stopped for repairs? No! Not even a second can be wasted! The leader of the machine repair department's revolutionary rebel team took a soldier and, without hesitation, sucked out the dirt in the oil pipe with his mouth, ensuring that the machine ran without stopping.

The production record was broken time and time again. Eighteen thousand packages, twenty thousand packages, and finally reaching twenty-five thousand nine hundred seventy packages, far surpassing the original highest production record of eleven thousand four hundred packages. Listen to the words of these miracle creators: "The port workers have spirit, what's so special about this little 'Pantos' ship; everything for Chairman Mao, we will fight to the end with imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries!"

Foreign sailors shouted, "Long live Mao Zedong!"

At 1:00 AM on June 4, a thrilling report spread throughout the area: "The 34,000 tons of cargo on the 'Pantos' ship were all unloaded in the new record of three days and four hours and forty minutes, not only completing the original plan ahead of schedule but also far surpassing the 'advanced level in Europe.' The revolutionary workers of the Second Area sang a song of victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and jumped with joy for another great victory of the radiant Mao Zedong Thought!

Many foreign sailors on the ship were moved and admired by the Chinese port workers' boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. Some foreign sailors raised their thumbs and said, "I truly saw the revolutionary spirit of Chinese workers educated by Mao Zedong Thought!" They were excited to face the portrait of Chairman Mao and shouted in Chinese, "Long live Mao Zedong! Long live Mao Zedong!"

    抓革命促生产的新凯歌
    ——上海港第二装卸区创造外轮卸货新纪录的故事
    在光辉的红五月里，伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席接见全国铁路、交通会议代表的特大喜讯传到了上海，上海港务局第二装卸区无产阶级革命派和革命群众，心潮翻滚，热泪盈眶。他们立下誓言，一定要在革命和生产上做出更好的成绩，发展大好形势，来回答毛主席和林副主席的关怀和期望。就在这个光辉的红五月里，他们经过连续奋战，以三天又四小时四十分的时间，为一艘外轮卸完了三万四千吨物资，创造了外轮卸货新纪录，实现了自己的誓言，为伟大的社会主义祖国立了新功，为无产阶级文化大革命增添了新的光彩。
    工人阶级的有力回答
    五月下旬，一艘外轮“盘托斯”号来到上海港。这是它第二次来我国港口了。
    为了打好卸货这一仗，二区革委会召开了革命群众大会，进行“战前动员”。广大革命群众决心又快又好地卸下三万四千吨物资。顿时，全区出现一片紧张而又热烈的战斗气氛。
    战斗正要开始，“盘托斯”号外轮的船长，以怀疑的口吻问道：“这次你们要卸多少时间？”我们的工作人员回答说：“不超过七天。”这位船长听了一怔，连连摇头说：“不可能！不可能！欧洲先进水平还要六天呢。”在毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的大风大浪中锻炼出来的中国工人的无限创造力，他是不能理解的。然而，二区工人发出一个有力的声音：“欧洲六天，我们只要五天！”
    阶级斗争，一抓就灵
    树欲静而风不止。正当全区革命群众积极准备迎接卸货的时刻，忽然一股破坏抓革命、促生产的阴风，从阴沟洞里刮了出来。
    在二区革委会内部，有的同志也是“难”字当头，怕时间太紧。二区革委会按照毛主席的“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”和相信群众、依靠群众的教导，带领群众，进一步开展轰轰烈烈的革命大批判，把妄图颠覆革命委员会、破坏抓革命促生产的坏家伙揪了出来。
    二区革委会还发动群众批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在海港的代理人推行的反革命修正主义路线。通过革命大批判，干部中的畏难思想、一些束缚群众积极性的陈规旧章，也被进一步猛烈地冲破了，群众的革命和生产的积极性大大发挥出来。
    “毛主席指挥我们战斗！”
    一场艰巨的卸货战斗的序幕揭开了。
    二区革命职工活学活用毛主席关于在战略上要藐视敌人、在战术上要重视敌人的伟大思想，首先对这次卸货任务作了周密的分析：这条船实际载重量三万五千吨，在上海港卸货作业中还是少见的；它又是第一次来上海，船型不熟悉，如何部署作业，心中没底。为了做到知己知彼，船还未进港，他们就派出“侦察员”上船察看“阵地”，在现场研究好作业的部署，这样就使工前准备时间由原来的三个小时缩短为一个小时。
    时间就是胜利，一分一秒也要争。这条船吃水比较深，按以往惯例，要先在吴淞口外或黄浦江心抛锚，再用驳船卸下一部分货物，以降低吃水深度，然后再靠岸卸货。可是这样做要大大延长轮船卸货时间，怎么办？区革委会依靠最有实践经验的无产阶级革命派战士，把困难摊给群众。群众中蕴藏着无限的创造力。他们分析了江水涨落的时间，和引水员密切配合，赶在平潮时靠岸，抢在落潮前卸下部分货物。就这样，他们又赢得了时间。
      “一切为着毛主席！毛主席指挥我们战斗！”码头上灯火通明，工人同志夜以继日、争分夺秒地奋战。有的老工人一连三天三夜守候在码头上。退休老工人也来了，仓库里的司机同志，该下班的不肯交班，该上班的硬要接班。驻二区的公安派出所和二区革委会的机关干部，也到码头端茶送水，参加了战斗。正当战斗紧张的时刻，一架吸扬机的油管突然堵塞了。要不要停机抢修？不！一分一秒也不能停！机修部门工人革命造反队队长带着一个战士，毫不犹豫地用嘴吸出油管中的脏东西，保证了机器轰隆轰隆地运转不停。
    班产纪录，一次又一次突破。一万八千包，两万包，最后达到两万五千九百七十包，把原来最高班产纪录一万一千四百包，远远抛在后面。请听听这些奇迹创造者们的豪言壮语：“海港工人有志气，小小‘盘’轮何足奇；一切为了毛主席，誓与帝修反战到底！”
      外国船员高呼“毛泽东万岁！”
    六月四日凌晨一时，一个振奋人心的捷报，传遍了全区：“盘托斯”轮上的三万四千吨物资，以三天又四小时四十分的最新纪录全部卸完，不仅提前完成原定计划，也把“欧洲先进水平”远远抛在后边。二区革命职工，为无产阶级文化大革命又一曲凯歌齐声欢唱，为光芒四射的毛泽东思想又一伟大胜利而纵情跳跃！
    外轮上许多外国海员工人，为我国海港工人对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的感情所感动，钦佩不已。有的外国船员翘起大拇指说：“我真正看到了毛泽东思想教育下的中国工人的革命干劲！”他们激动地面对毛主席的画像，用中国话高呼：“毛泽东万岁！毛泽东万岁！”
