	Breaking Mountains and Forging Paths
	By [[Albania]] Ā·Qiàqí

	The youth with fiery blood show their might,
	Swearing to bring light to the countryside.
	The mountains transform with great change,
	The masses unite to break through the peaks.

	Labor brings joy and hearts bloom,
	Breaking mountains and forging paths is glorious.
	With shovels and picks in hand,
	Building a new, happy farmstead.

	The towering mountains shine with gold,
	The motherland is beautiful and strong.
	We love you deeply from the heart,
	Motherland, motherland, dear parents.

	Youthful passion fills our hearts,
	We vow to make the high mountains our battlefield.
	Sweat brings happiness,
	Passion like fire, will like steel.

    开山劈岭
   〔阿尔巴尼亚〕阿·恰奇
    热血青年逞豪强，
    誓把光明送山乡。
    山区生活大变化，
    万众一心开山忙。
    劳动欢畅心花放，
    开山劈岭多荣光。
    双手挥舞锹和镐，
    建设幸福新农庄。
    巍巍高山闪金光，
    祖国美丽又富强。
    我们衷心热爱你，
    祖国祖国亲爹娘。
    青春豪情满胸怀，
    誓将高山作战场。
    汗水换得幸福来，
    热情如火志如钢。
