Uruguayan workers stage nationwide general strike

Public transportation paralyzed, newspapers cease publication, port activities halted, business and commerce severely impacted

	BEIJING, June 19 — MONTEVIDEO — Uruguayan workers held a 24-hour general strike on June 18 to protest the government's so-called emergency security measures, which are fascist decrees aimed at suppressing the rising workers' and student movements.

	The general strike dealt a severe blow to various industrial and commercial sectors, paralyzing public transportation, halting newspaper publication, and stopping all port activities.

	Workers demanded the immediate abolition of the reactionary measures announced by the authorities on June 13, which included banning public assemblies and demonstrations, and imposing censorship on news reports about workers' and students' struggles.

	The Uruguayan authorities, severely impacted by the mass movement, then adopted other high-pressure tactics in an attempt to stop the workers' and students' movements, which have been on the rise since January this year. The government authorities threatened to dismiss workers and civil servants in some departments who went on strike on June 17. The authorities also ordered the nationwide military to be on alert and dispatched military police to patrol the streets.

	The workers' general strike was a direct response to the Uruguayan authorities' suppression measures. On the day before the general strike was announced, postal workers and students continued their strikes and demonstrations, resisting the authorities' so-called emergency security measures and the threat to return to work. Students in the capital held mass demonstrations outside the university square. A group of demonstrators built barricades with benches and large wooden planks, using stones to counter police attacks. Another group of angry protesters used burning obstacles to block a train running between Montevideo and Colonia. They also posted and erected large banners opposing the authorities' reactionary measures.

	Due to the Uruguayan authorities' intensified implementation of a series of plundering policies controlled by the United States through the International Monetary Fund, the Uruguayan economy has been deteriorating, and people's lives have become increasingly impoverished. According to reports, Uruguay, with a population of just over two million, owes more than $500 million in foreign debt, with an average debt of over $200 per person. American monopolies have repeatedly forced Uruguay to devalue its currency. Following seven currency devaluations last year, Uruguay devalued the peso by 25 percent on April 29 this year, from 200 pesos to the dollar to 250 pesos to the dollar. The result of the currency devaluation was a sharp increase in living expenses. According to reports, living expenses rose by 136 percent last year, and by about 30 percent in the first three months of this year. Since the peso was devalued by 25 percent this time, the prices of some consumer goods have risen by 40 percent, and electricity and telephone charges have risen by 50 percent.

	To maintain their right to live, Uruguayan workers have been continuously fighting. In recent months, strikes have continued in more than ten industries. At the same time, Uruguayan students have also held continuous anti-American and anti-government demonstrations, occupying schools, erecting barricades, and engaging in fierce struggles with the military police.

	The heroic struggle of Uruguayan workers and students has severely impacted the monopoly capitalist ruling class of this country, putting its political situation in a state of crisis. (Accompanying picture)

    给反动当局的镇压暴行以迎头痛击
    乌拉圭工人举行全国总罢工
    公共交通瘫痪，报纸停止出版，港口活动全部停顿，工商业遭到严重打击
    新华社十九日讯　蒙得维的亚消息：乌拉圭全国工人十八日举行二十四小时总罢工，抗议政府当局实行所谓紧急安全措施的法西斯法令，镇压日益高涨的工人和学生运动。
    总罢工使各个工业和商业部门遭到严重打击，公共交通瘫痪，报纸停止出版，港口活动全部停顿。
    工人们要求立即废除当局在十三日宣布的使国家进入戒严状态的反动措施，其中包括禁止群众举行集会和示威，对报道工人和学生斗争的消息实行新闻检查等。
    受到群众运动浪潮严重冲击的乌拉圭当局，接着又采取其它高压手段妄想阻止从今年一月以来就在不断高涨的工人和学生运动。政府当局曾在十五日威胁罢工的一些部门的工人和公务员在十七日复工，否则就要把他们开除。当局还下令全国驻军处于戒备状态，并派出军警部队在大街上进行巡逻。
    工人的总罢工是对乌拉圭当局镇压措施的直接回答。在宣布总罢工的前一天，邮政局工作人员和学生继续罢工和举行示威，反抗当局的所谓紧急安全措施和威胁复工的命令。首都学生成批地在大学广场外面举行示威游行。一批示威学生用板凳和大木头筑起街垒，用石块回击警察的进攻。另有一批愤怒的群众用燃烧的障碍物阻拦了一列行驶在蒙得维的亚和埃斯特角之间的火车。他们还张贴和竖起大标语，反对当局的反动措施。
    由于乌拉圭当局加紧推行美国控制的国际货币基金组织的一系列掠夺政策，致使乌拉圭经济不断恶化，人民生活日益贫困。据报道，仅有二百多万人口的乌拉圭就欠外债达五亿多美元，平均每个人负债二百多美元。美国垄断集团还一再迫使乌拉圭将货币贬值。继去年实行七次货币贬值以后，乌拉圭今年四月二十九日又把比索贬值了百分之二十五，由二百比索兑一美元上升到二百五十比索兑一美元。货币贬值的结果，造成生活费用暴涨。据报道，去年全年生活费用上涨了百分之一百三十六，今年头三个月又上涨了百分之三十左右。而自从这次比索贬值百分之二十五以来，一些消费品又上涨了百分之四十，电力和电话费用上涨了百分之五十。
    乌拉圭劳动人民为了维持自己的生活权利，不断开展斗争。近几个月来，继续在十多个行业中爆发罢工。同时，乌拉圭学生也连续举行反美和反政府示威，他们占领学校，树起街垒，同镇压的军警展开英勇搏斗。
    乌拉圭工人和学生的英勇斗争严重地打击了这个国家垄断资产阶级统治集团，使其政局处在危机状态中。（附图片）
