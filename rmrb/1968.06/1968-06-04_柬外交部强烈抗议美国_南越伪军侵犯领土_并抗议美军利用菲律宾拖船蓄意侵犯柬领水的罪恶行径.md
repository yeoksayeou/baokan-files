Cambodian Foreign Ministry Strongly Protests U.S.-South Vietnamese Puppet Forces' Invasion of Territory

	And Protests U.S. Military's Intentional Violation of Cambodian Waters Using a Philippine Tugboat

	According to a report by Xinhua News Agency in Phnom Penh on June 3, the Cambodian News Agency reported: The Cambodian Foreign Ministry sent two notes on May 29 and 30 to the U.S. government and the Saigon puppet regime, strongly protesting the U.S.-South Vietnamese puppet forces' new invasions of Cambodia's Prey Veng, Takeo, and Kampong Cham provinces on April 30, May 4, 8, 12, and 16. These invasions resulted in two deaths and one injury in Cambodia. The notes firmly demand that the U.S. government and the South Vietnamese puppet regime stop these evil acts.

	According to a report by Xinhua News Agency in Phnom Penh, the Cambodian News Agency reported that on May 28, the Cambodian Foreign Ministry sent a note to the U.S. government through the Australian Embassy in Phnom Penh, protesting the U.S. military's intentional violation of Cambodian waters using a Philippine tugboat.

	On May 20, the Royal Cambodian Navy intercepted a Philippine tugboat in Cambodian waters opposite Kampong Cham village in the province of Kampong Cham. There were two armed American personnel and eight Filipinos on board the tugboat.

	The note stated that the Royal Government of Cambodia firmly rejects the U.S.'s claim of "navigation error."

    柬外交部强烈抗议美国—南越伪军侵犯领土
    并抗议美军利用菲律宾拖船蓄意侵犯柬领水的罪恶行径
    据新华社金边三日电　据柬埔寨新闻社一日报道：柬埔寨外交部在五月二十九日和三十日两次分别向美国政府和西贡傀儡当局发出照会，强烈抗议美国—南越伪军在四月三十日、五月四日、八日、十二日和十六日对柬埔寨波萝勉省、磅湛省和柴桢省的新侵犯。这些侵犯，造成柬埔寨两人死亡，一人受伤。照会坚决要求美国政府和南越傀儡当局停止这类罪恶行径。
    新华社金边电　据柬埔寨新闻社报道，柬埔寨外交部五月二十八日通过澳大利亚驻金边大使馆照会美国政府，抗议美国军队利用一艘菲律宾拖船蓄意侵犯柬埔寨领水的罪恶行径。
    五月二十日，柬埔寨王家海军在干丹省堪三纳村对面的柬埔寨水域中，截获了一艘菲律宾拖船。在这艘拖船上有两名美国武装人员和八名菲律宾人。
    照会说，王国政府断然拒绝美国提出的是所谓“航行错误”的说法。
    照会说，美国为了卑鄙地要回船上的两名美国军人而提出的要求，是不能被接受的。这两名美国军人将按照柬埔寨的法律予以处理。
    柬埔寨外交部在同一天还照会菲律宾政府，要求菲律宾政府采取措施，避免再次发生类似事件。
    另据柬埔寨新闻社报道，柬埔寨王国政府五月二十九日照会美国政府和西贡傀儡当局，抗议美国—南越伪军五月一日派遣飞机侵犯柬埔寨领空，扫射柬埔寨磅湛省邦奇隆村的罪行。
