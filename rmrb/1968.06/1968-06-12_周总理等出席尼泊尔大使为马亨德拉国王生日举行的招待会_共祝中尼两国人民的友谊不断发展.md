Premier Zhou and others attended a reception hosted by the Nepalese Ambassador for King Mahendra's birthday, celebrating the continuous development of friendship between the peoples of China and Nepal.

The New China News Agency reported on June 11 that the Nepalese Ambassador to China, Rendra Subba, hosted a reception for the birthday of King Mahendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev of the Kingdom of Nepal.

Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi, and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, among others, were invited to attend the reception.

Ambassador Rendra Subba and Vice Premier Chen Yi both spoke at the friendly reception, expressing their wishes for the continuous development of friendship between the peoples of China and Nepal.

Ambassador Subba spoke about the measures taken by Nepal under King Mahendra's leadership in national construction and introduced Nepal's non-aligned and neutral foreign policy. He said that the friendship between Nepal and China is based on mutual trust. Although our political and economic systems are different, this does not hinder our understanding of each other's issues nor our mutual respect for each other's opinions.

The ambassador said that China's economic aid to Nepal is substantial and has been of great help to us. Summarizing our experience of more than a decade of economic cooperation with China, we tell our Chinese friends: "We highly value your aid, and we even more highly value the spirit in which you provide this aid."

Ambassador Subba praised the progress made by the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao in various fields. He said, "Like true friends, we are happy about every new achievement you make. Undoubtedly, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, China will become increasingly strong."

Vice Premier Chen Yi said in his speech that the Kingdom of Nepal, under the leadership of King Mahendra, has been steadfast in maintaining national sovereignty and independence, resisting external interference and subversion, and has made progress in domestic construction. The Chinese government and people will, as always, actively support Nepal's peaceful, neutral, and independent policies and actively support the efforts of the Nepalese people to maintain national independence and develop the national economy.

He said that Vice Prime Minister of Nepal, Bishta, recently visited our country on a friendly visit and conveyed King Mahendra's cordial greetings and good wishes to the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and conveyed the deep friendship of the Nepalese people to the Chinese people. We express our heartfelt thanks for this. We are fully convinced that, on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, continuing to develop friendly and cooperative relations between China and Nepal is in the interests of the peoples of the two countries and is conducive to the common cause of unity against imperialism among the peoples of Asia and Africa.

Vice Premier Chen Yi praised the consolidation and development of friendly cooperation between China and Nepal as an example of friendly neighborliness between countries with different social systems. He said that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are precisely those put forward and consistently implemented by the liberated Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Now, some people are eager to follow imperialism and modern revisionism, spreading rumors and slanders against China, and actively working to form a new anti-China alliance. In fact, they have long since destroyed the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence they once supported and have consistently practiced great-power chauvinism and expansionism. Their anti-China conspiracies will never succeed.

Vice Premier Chen Yi emphasized that yesterday, the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, under the manipulation of the big powers, passed a proposal to peddle the so-called Non-Proliferation Treaty. This is a major conspiracy to maintain the nuclear monopoly of the big powers and to oppose China and the peoples of the world. This treaty is a product of the big powers' strong-arm politics and is a thoroughly unequal treaty. The Chinese government and people firmly oppose it.

In his speech, Vice Premier Chen Yi discussed the significance and great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao. He said that the Chinese people will follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, unite with the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, resolutely oppose the aggressive and war policies of American imperialism, resolutely oppose the treacherous actions of modern revisionism, and resolutely support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries for national independence and liberation.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that Chairman Mao teaches us: "The just struggles of the peoples of all countries in the world are mutually supportive." We will continue to work hard, together with our Nepalese friends, to further consolidate and develop the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Nepal.

Those who were invited to attend the reception also included leaders from relevant government departments, the People's Liberation Army, the Beijing Revolutionary Committee, and representatives of revolutionary mass organizations in Beijing.

Ambassadors from various countries to China were also invited to attend the reception.

    新华社十一日讯　尼泊尔驻中国大使伦迪尔·苏巴为尼泊尔王国国王马亨德拉·比尔·比克拉姆·沙阿·德瓦的生日，今晚举行招待会。
    国务院总理周恩来、副总理陈毅、人大常委会副委员长郭沫若等，应邀出席招待会。
    伦迪尔·苏巴大使和陈毅副总理，在充满友好气氛的招待会上先后讲话，他们共祝中尼两国人民的友谊不断发展。
    苏巴大使在讲话中谈到了尼泊尔在马亨德拉国王领导下在国家建设方面所采取的措施，介绍了尼泊尔奉行的不结盟和中立的外交政策。他说，尼中两国的友谊是建立在互相信任基础上的真正友谊。我们两国的政治和经济制度不相同，但这并不妨碍我们了解彼此的问题，也不妨碍我们互相尊重对方的意见。
    大使说，中国对尼泊尔的经济援助是相当大的，这一援助对我们有极大的帮助。作为十多年来我们同中国进行经济合作的经验总结，我们对中国朋友们说：“我们十分珍视你们的援助，我们更加珍视你们提供援助的精神。”
    苏巴大使赞扬中国人民在毛主席领导下在各个领域内所取得的进步。他说，象真正的朋友一样，我们对你们所取得的每一个新成就感到高兴。毫无疑问，在毛主席的领导下中国将会日益强大起来。
    陈毅副总理在讲话中说，尼泊尔王国在马亨德拉国王的领导下，为维护国家主权和民族独立、反对外来干涉和颠覆，进行了坚持不懈的斗争，在国内建设方面也取得了进展。中国政府和中国人民将一如既往，积极支持尼泊尔所采取的和平中立、独立自主的政策，积极支持尼泊尔人民为维护民族独立、发展民族经济所作的努力。
    他说，尼泊尔王国副首相比斯塔最近对我国进行友好访问时，转达了马亨德拉国王对中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的亲切问候和良好祝愿，转达了尼泊尔人民对中国人民的深厚友情，我们对此表示衷心的感谢。我们完全相信，在和平共处五项原则的基础上，继续发展中尼之间的友好合作关系，是符合两国人民的利益的，是有利于亚非人民团结反帝的共同事业的。
    陈毅副总理赞扬中尼两国友好合作关系的巩固和发展，是不同社会制度国家友好睦邻的范例。他说，和平共处五项原则正是解放了的、用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民首先倡议并坚持贯彻执行的。现在，有人热衷于追随帝国主义和现代修正主义，对中国竭尽造谣诽谤之能事，并且四处活动，妄图拼凑新的反华联盟。其实，他们早就破坏了曾经拥护过的和平共处五项原则，并且一贯实行大国沙文主义和扩张主义。他们的反华阴谋，是决不会得逞的。
    陈毅副总理强调说，昨天，联合国大会政治委员会，在大国操纵下通过了一项兜售所谓防止核扩散条约的提案。这是维护大国核垄断、反对中国和世界各国人民的一个重大阴谋。这个条约是大国玩弄强权政治的产物，是一个地地道道的不平等条约。中国政府和中国人民坚决表示反对。
    陈毅副总理在讲话中谈到我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的意义和伟大胜利。他说，中国人民将遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，同亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的人民联合起来，坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，坚决反对现代修正主义的叛卖行径，坚决支持各国人民争取民族独立和解放的革命斗争。
    陈毅副总理说，毛主席教导我们：“全世界各国人民的正义斗争，都是互相支持的。”我们要继续努力，同尼泊尔朋友一道，使中尼两国的友好合作关系进一步巩固和发展。
    应邀出席招待会的，还有政府有关部门、中国人民解放军、北京市革命委员会的负责人，和北京革命群众组织的代表。
    各国驻中国的使节，也应邀出席了招待会。
