The Revolutionary Committee of Fengtai Station of the Beijing Railway Bureau, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's support-left personnel, has earnestly implemented the series of latest instructions from the great leader Chairman Mao. It firmly relies on the revolutionary masses, unites all revolutionary forces that can be united, strictly differentiates between the two types of contradictions, and launches a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies. This has made the revolution roar and production flourish. Through the fiery struggle of class struggle, the class consciousness of the broad revolutionary workers has been greatly enhanced. From January to May this year, the main production indicators such as the cargo loading task and the train transfer time, stop time, and punctuality rate have all exceeded the same period of 1966, when the station's production tasks were relatively outstanding. The Revolutionary Committee has been continuously consolidated and developed in leading the masses to carry out class struggle, enhancing proletarian revolutionary authority, and being more supported by the revolutionary masses.

Since its establishment in 1895, Fengtai Station has been an important hub in China's railway transportation. Currently, it is a key junction connecting the Jingguang, Jingshan, Fengsha lines, and the Beijing ring lines, facilitating north-south transportation across the country. It is one of the largest marshalling and freight stations in the country, known as the gateway to the capital, and bears a very heavy transportation task. Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party at the station faithfully carried out the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of Khrushchev and his agents in the railway system. They colluded with traitors, protected and promoted bad elements, and peddled a lot of revisionist goods in enterprise management. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary forces at the station, after repeated and fierce struggles, won the struggle to seize power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and established the Revolutionary Committee in November last year.

After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, it faced increasingly heavy transportation and production tasks. Some people thought that the Revolutionary Committee should concentrate its efforts on production first to ensure smooth transportation. After careful study and research, the members of the Revolutionary Committee clearly recognized that the leading cadre of the Revolutionary Committee should first be a revolutionary cadre that emphasizes proletarian politics, rather than a cadre that focuses solely on business. Revolution is the locomotive that drives production. The Revolutionary Committee can only firmly take the road of emphasizing proletarian politics, continue to mobilize the masses to launch a fierce attack on the class enemy, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, to truly ensure the completion of transportation tasks. On the basis of uniting thoughts and improving understanding, the Revolutionary Committee mobilized the masses to root out several traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries who had long been hiding in the revolutionary ranks and had usurped key positions at the station. These elements, under the protection and promotion of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, had once held the leadership of transportation and production; after the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, they disrupted the order of railway transportation, causing great harm to Fengtai Station. The living facts of class struggle made the members of the Revolutionary Committee realize that if the poison of the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" and other counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies spread by Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party were not eliminated, and if the traitors, spies, and all counter-revolutionaries hiding within the revolutionary ranks were not rooted out, then it would be impossible to complete the production tasks. To complete the heavy transportation and production tasks, it is necessary to first focus on the revolution. After the members of the Revolutionary Committee's understanding was further improved, they immediately led the proletarian revolutionary forces and the broad revolutionary masses to launch a fierce attack on the class enemy. They mobilized the broad revolutionary masses to, in conjunction with various specific tasks and the reality of class struggle, launch a high tide of revolutionary criticism. Everyone criticized with their mouths and pens, fiercely denouncing the counter-revolutionary revisionist enterprise line implemented by Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party at Fengtai Station, as well as the management system that served this line and restricted the creativity and initiative of the workers. In the past half year, Fengtai Station has held more than 100 criticism meetings, and the revolutionary workers have also written many big-character posters. The revolutionary criticism greatly enhanced the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary workers. Everyone sharpened their eyes, heightened their vigilance, and rooted out a batch of traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries who had long been hiding, achieving one victory after another in the stormy class struggle.

In the proactive attack on a handful of class enemies, the station Revolutionary Committee, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's support-left personnel, paid great attention to grasping the new trends of class struggle, educating the proletarian revolutionary forces and the broad revolutionary masses to strictly differentiate between the two types of contradictions, unite all revolutionary forces that can be united, and stably, accurately, and fiercely strike at a handful of class enemies. When the proletarian revolutionary forces actively cleaned up their own class ranks, a handful of class enemies took the opportunity to incite bourgeois factionalism, urging the originally opposing organizations to suppress each other, and pulling out some people who had made mistakes or serious mistakes but belonged to the people's internal contradictions from the originally opposing organizations to struggle against. Upon discovering this, the Revolutionary Committee immediately organized the masses to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of the revolution, and also the primary question of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," and to study the party's policies, exposing the enemy's tricks and raising their own policy and strategic levels. A part of the masses in the cargo yard workshop, under the influence of the counter-revolutionary economism incited by the class enemy, arbitrarily changed the original three-shift production to three-and-a-half-shift production, shortening working hours and increasing rest time, resulting in cargo accumulation and passive operations, and affecting unity with workers from other workshops. Under the guidance of correctly differentiating between the two types of contradictions, the Revolutionary Committee organized revolutionary workers to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, seriously studying Chairman Mao's relevant teachings, making them realize that to fiercely strike at a handful of class enemies, it is necessary to help the deceived masses raise their consciousness and return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Only by forming a vast revolutionary army, no matter how ferocious or cunning the enemy is, they cannot escape the fate of complete failure. The deceived masses in the cargo yard, through study, generally raised their consciousness and further recognized the harm of counter-revolutionary economism.

As a result of this struggle, the class enemy was exposed, and the majority of the masses were united. At the same time, the Revolutionary Committee more clearly realized that if the proletarian revolutionary forces do not strive to unite the broad masses, the class enemy will inevitably try to win them over. Therefore, while paying attention to guiding the proletarian revolutionary forces to unite the broad masses, they also, for those who made mistakes or serious mistakes, did their best to help them with enthusiasm and seriously criticized their mistakes, striving to win them over to the revolutionary ranks. As a result, the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary masses was increasingly heightened. They more closely united around the Revolutionary Committee. A handful of stubborn capitalist-roaders and traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries became increasingly isolated, and their tricks were quickly exposed in broad daylight.

The Revolutionary Committee of Fengtai Station strictly differentiates between the two types of contradictions, unites all revolutionary forces that can be united, and launches a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies, using revolution to promote production. The result is that its proletarian revolutionary authority has been enhanced, and it has been warmly supported by the broad revolutionary masses. The revolutionary masses encouraged them, saying: "No matter how busy you are, if you don't focus on class struggle, you are busy for nothing. The direction of attacking the class enemy cannot be changed." Some said: "The Revolutionary Committee is great! It is truly a command center for class struggle." The broad revolutionary workers supported the newly born Revolutionary Committee with the actual actions of focusing on revolution and promoting production. The workers took an oath: they would never allow cargo to accumulate at Fengtai Station. They worked with sky-high enthusiasm, sometimes doubling the daily loading and unloading volume. They promptly loaded and unloaded the transfer cargo sent from various stations across the country to Fengtai Station, creating various favorable conditions for various brother stations.

    丰台车站革委会在对敌斗争中严格区分两类不同性质矛盾
    团结一切可以团结的革命力量
    稳准狠地向阶级敌人发动猛攻
    据新华社二十一日讯　北京铁路局丰台车站革命委员会，在人民解放军支左人员帮助下，认真落实伟大领袖毛主席的一系列最新指示，坚定地依靠革命群众，团结一切可以团结的革命力量，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，稳、准、狠地向一小撮阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，把革命搞得轰轰烈烈，生产蒸蒸日上。广大革命职工在阶级斗争的烈火中经受了锻炼，无产阶级觉悟空前提高，今年一月至五月货物装车任务和列车中转时间、停站时间、正点率等主要生产指标，都超过了这个车站生产任务完成得比较突出的一九六六年的同期的水平。革命委员会在领导群众进行阶级斗争中不断得到巩固和发展，提高了无产阶级革命权威，更加受到革命群众的拥护。
    丰台车站从一八九五年建立以来，在我国铁路交通运输中就有着重要的地位。目前它是连接京广、京山、丰沙和北京环城各线、沟通祖国南北交通的枢纽，是全国最大的列车编组站和货运站之一，被称为首都的门户，担负着极为繁重的运输任务。无产阶级文化大革命以前，车站党内一小撮走资派，忠实执行中国赫鲁晓夫及其在铁路系统代理人的反革命修正主义路线，他们招降纳叛，包庇和重用坏人，在企业管理中贩卖了许多修正主义黑货。无产阶级文化大革命中，车站的无产阶级革命派经过反复的激烈的斗争，取得了向党内一小撮走资派夺权斗争的胜利，并于去年十一月成立了革命委员会。
    革命委员会成立后，面临着日益繁重的运输生产任务。有的人认为，革命委员会应当集中精力，把生产先抓起来，保证运输的畅通。革委会成员经过认真学习研究之后，明确地认识到，革命委员会这个领导班子，首先应当是突出无产阶级政治的革命班子，而不是单纯抓业务的班子。革命是带动生产的火车头。革命委员会只有坚定地走突出无产阶级政治的道路，继续发动群众向阶级敌人展开猛烈的进攻，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，才能真正保证运输任务的完成。在统一思想、提高认识的基础上，革委会放手发动群众，挖出了几个长期隐藏在革命队伍中，并窃踞了车站关键岗位的叛徒、特务和反革命分子。这些家伙过去在党内一小撮走资派的包庇和重用下，曾把持了运输生产的领导权；革命委员会成立以后，他们破坏铁路运输秩序，给丰台车站带来了极大危害。活生生的阶级斗争事实，使革委会成员更加认识到，如果不肃清中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派所散布的“阶级斗争熄灭”论等反革命修正主义谬论的流毒，如果不把隐藏在革命队伍内部的叛徒、特务和一切反革命分子挖出来，那么，完成生产任务也是不可能的。要完成繁重的运输生产任务，必须首先狠抓革命。革委会成员的认识进一步提高后，立即带领无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，向阶级敌人发动猛烈的进攻。他们发动广大革命群众，结合各项具体任务，结合阶级斗争的实际，掀起了革命大批判的高潮，人人口诛笔伐，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派在丰台车站所推行的反革命修正主义办企业路线，以及为这条路线服务的限制工人创造性和积极性的一套管理制度。半年来，丰台车站已经开了一百多次批判大会，革命职工们还写了许多大字报。革命的大批判大大提高了广大革命职工的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，大家擦亮眼睛，提高警惕，挖出了一批长期隐藏下来的叛徒、特务和反革命分子，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中取得了一个又一个的胜利。
    在向一小撮阶级敌人主动进攻中，车站革命委员会在人民解放军支左人员帮助下，十分注意掌握阶级斗争的新动向，教育无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，团结一切可以团结的革命力量，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人。在无产阶级革命派主动清理自己阶级队伍的时候，一小撮阶级敌人乘机煽动资产阶级派性，要原来是对立面的组织乘机去压对方，把原来对方组织中一些犯有错误或严重错误但属于人民内部矛盾的人，也拉出来揪斗。革命委员会发觉后，就及时组织群众学习毛主席“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题，也是文化大革命的首要问题”的教导，学习党的方针政策，识破敌人的阴谋诡计，提高自己的政策水平和策略水平。货场车间的一部分群众，在阶级敌人煽动的反革命经济主义的影响下，擅自把原来的三班生产改为三班半生产，缩短劳动时间，增加休息时间，结果造成货物积压，作业被动，并影响了与其他车间职工的团结。革委会在正确区分两类不同性质的矛盾的思想指导下，组织革命职工举办毛泽东思想学习班，认真学习毛主席的有关教导，使他们认识到，为了狠狠打击一小撮阶级敌人，必须帮助受蒙蔽的群众提高觉悟，回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，只要组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，再凶恶、再狡猾的敌人也逃不脱彻底失败的命运。货场受蒙蔽的群众通过学习，也普遍提高了觉悟，进一步认识了反革命经济主义的毒害。
    这一场斗争的结果，揭露了阶级敌人，团结了大多数群众。同时，革命委员会更加清楚地认识到，无产阶级革命派不去争取、团结广大群众，阶级敌人就必然要去争夺。因此，他们在注意引导无产阶级革命派团结好广大群众的同时，对犯了错误或者严重错误的人，做到既要满腔热情地进行帮助，对他们的错误又严肃地进行批评，尽最大力量把他们争取到革命行列中来。这样做的结果，广大革命群众的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟越来越高，他们更紧密地团结在革委会的周围，一小撮顽固不化的走资派和叛徒、特务、反革命分子越来越孤立，他们有什么阴谋活动，很快就暴露在光天化日之下。
    丰台车站革命委员会严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，团结一切可以团结的革命力量，向一小撮阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，以革命带动生产的结果，提高了自己的无产阶级革命权威，受到了广大革命群众的热烈拥护。革命群众鼓励他们说：“千忙万忙，不抓阶级斗争就是瞎忙，向阶级敌人进攻这个方向不能变。”有的说：“革命委员会就是好！真正是个阶级斗争的指挥部。”广大革命职工用狠抓革命、猛促生产的实际行动，来支持新生的革命委员会。工人们立下誓言：决不能在丰台车站积压货物。他们用冲天的干劲搞生产，有时一天的装卸量超过平时一倍。他们及时把全国各站运到丰台站的中转货物装好卸好，为各兄弟站创造了各种有利条件。
