People of Fukuoka, Japan, hold anti-American protests, waving banners reading "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought!"

BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- According to a report from the Dongfang News Agency, patriotic people of Fukuoka Prefecture in Japan held a demonstration march on June 16, strongly demanding the withdrawal of the U.S. airbase in Itazuke.

On that afternoon, 100 activists from the headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) in Fukuoka and other prefectures, defying the threats and suppression by the police of the reactionary Sato government, held a rally in front of the gate of the Itazuke U.S. military base, waving red banners reading "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought!"

In his speech at the rally, Fukuda Masakazu, chairman of the Fukuoka Prefecture branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), said: The great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out, "At present, the world revolution has entered a great new era." In Japan, the struggle to drive out U.S. imperialism is going on everywhere. We must definitely abolish the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and strive for Japan's independence.

Representatives from the Kumamoto and Saga prefecture branches of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) and the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Committee also spoke at the rally.

Meanwhile, about 800 patriotic young workers and students from various parts of Fukuoka Prefecture gathered in front of the Fukuoka City Hall and marched through the main streets of the city and the Itazuke airbase. They joined the demonstrators from the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) in front of the gate of the Itazuke airbase and engaged in a fierce struggle with 600 armed police guarding the base. They shouted slogans such as "U.S. troops out of Itazuke! Out of Japan!" "Smash the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty!" "Withdraw the U.S. airbase at Yamada!" and threw stones at the police who were beating the demonstrators with batons. Hundreds of citizens gathered around the demonstrators, encouraging their brave struggle.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Tokyo, more than 200 patriotic students in Japan, defying the threats and suppression by the reactionary armed police, recently held a demonstration march near the U.S. field hospital in Tokyo's Oji, demanding the withdrawal of the hospital.

Patriotic students and many residents who supported them gathered in front of Oji Station Square to hold a rally. At the rally, student representatives spoke one after another, severely condemning U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam, and calling on the Japanese people to take action to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation. The students also condemned U.S. imperialism's "peace talks" fraud on the Vietnam issue.

In their speeches, the student representatives also expressed strong support for the revolutionary struggles of the people in France, Europe, and North America.

After the rally, all the participants marched to the U.S. field hospital with high spirits. Many citizens also joined the march. (Accompanying photo)
