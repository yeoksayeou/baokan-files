To the Border, to the Countryside, to Labor, to Struggle!

In the triumphant song of the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we—red guards who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao—are about to embark on our journey, to the border, to the countryside, to labor, to struggle! How can we not be moved, how can we not be filled with boundless excitement! With boundless love, faith, loyalty, and admiration for our great leader Chairman Mao, we sincerely wish our red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life!

"Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman, conducting revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Over the past two years, to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and to defend the proletarian's mountains and rivers, we have followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and undergone tempering in storms and waves.

Today, the proletarian headquarters, with Chairman Mao at the core and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy, has pointed out a new direction for us to fight: face the countryside, face the border, face the factories, face the grassroots. We—Chairman Mao's red guards, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, after criticizing and repudiating revisionism, are determined to be like Comrade Tan Zhenlin, thinking of Chairman Mao in everything, submitting to Chairman Mao in everything, following Chairman Mao in everything, and doing everything for Chairman Mao. We will resolutely take the path of integrating with the workers and peasants.

What path should the young intellectuals take? On this question, there has always been a fierce struggle between two classes, two lines, and two paths. Our great leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "The final dividing line between revolutionary and non-revolutionary or counter-revolutionary intellectuals is whether they are willing and able to integrate with the workers and peasants." This is the only correct path for the revolutionization of young intellectuals, a long-term plan for cultivating and training successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause! However, the Chinese Khrushchev has been peddling the bourgeois philistine philosophy of "suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage." He shamelessly tells young intellectuals who are determined to go to the mountains and countryside: "You are the first generation of cultured peasants in China. The first generation should gain advantages." "I advise you, after returning to your hometown, not to be an official, but to seriously farm for three to five years.... If you meet three conditions (indicating knowing how to farm, having culture, and having a good relationship with the peasants), you can become an official at the county, provincial, or even central level, depending on your abilities." In the eyes of this biggest capitalist-roader within the party, whether it is studying, advancing, or going to the mountains and countryside, it is all just a means for personal promotion, wealth, fame, and status. He attempts to use these rotten bourgeois goods to drag the youth into the quagmire of revisionism, truly deserving of a thousand deaths!

The old Beijing Normal University Affiliated Middle School is also a fierce battlefield for the struggle between the two classes over the younger generation. It is a "key" and "elite" school promoted by the old Beijing Municipal Committee. The capitalist-roaders in our school have loyally executed the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev for more than a decade, using every means to prevent revolutionary students from taking the path of integrating with the workers and peasants. They say things like: "Not discussing advancement is not in line with the party's educational policy," and they emphasize how high the school's advancement rate has been, guiding students to pursue advancement and enter "key" universities. It seems that students from this school can only advance and cannot go to the mountains and countryside. Whose "educational policy" is this? When did the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao ever stipulate an educational policy that only allows advancement and not going to the mountains and countryside? Never! It has never been so!

Young intellectuals going to the mountains and countryside and integrating with the workers and peasants is a major measure to thoroughly uproot the roots of revisionism. We revolutionary youth resolutely take this bright path indicated by Chairman Mao, not for fame, not for personal gain, fearing neither hardship nor fatigue, wholeheartedly for the revolution, wholeheartedly for the people, going to the countryside, going to the border, going to where the motherland needs us the most. With our actual actions, we will smash the revisionist educational line and express our loyalty to Chairman Mao!

We are about to leave Beijing, leave the side of Chairman Mao, and head towards the three great struggles of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation. Although we will be far from Beijing, our hearts will be even closer to Chairman Mao. We are in the border, but our hearts are in Beijing. Dearest great leader Chairman Mao! Please rest assured! We will definitely always read your books, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions. We will study and apply the "Three Constantly Read Articles," thoroughly transform our worldview, and become your good soldiers! We will dedicate our entire youth and even our lives to the revolutionary cause in the border areas. We will not disappoint your expectations of us!

The revolution is calling, the people are calling! "With Chairman Mao's wave, we advance!" Revolutionary youth with aspirations and ideals, respond to Chairman Mao's call, go to the countryside, go to the border! Follow the path of the revolutionization of intellectuals indicated by Chairman Mao, advance bravely and never look back!

"We are doing what our predecessors have never done, a very glorious and great cause. Our goal must be achieved. Our goal will definitely be achieved."

A group of revolutionary young intellectuals in Beijing resolutely take the bright path of integrating with the workers and peasants indicated by the great leader Chairman Mao, eagerly heading towards the countryside and border, going to where the motherland needs them the most. Before departure, they came to Tiananmen Square to solemnly swear to Chairman Mao, determined to temper themselves into reliable successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause in the great storms and waves of class struggle.

### 到边疆，到农村，去劳动，去斗争！

    到边疆，到农村，去劳动，去斗争！
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，我们——无限忠于毛主席的红卫兵，即将踏上征途，到边疆，到农村，去劳动，去斗争，怎能不心潮翻滚，万分激动！我们满怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱、无限信仰、无限忠诚、无限崇拜，最衷心地敬祝我们心中最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”两年以来，为保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，为保卫无产阶级的江山，我们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在大风大浪中进行锻炼。
    今天，以毛主席为首，以林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部又给我们指出了新的战斗方向：面向农村，面向边疆，面向工矿，面向基层。我们——毛主席的红卫兵，在解放军帮助下，经过斗私批修，决心象门合同志那样，一切想着毛主席，一切服从毛主席，一切紧跟毛主席，一切为着毛主席，坚决走和工农群众相结合的道路。
    知识青年应该走什么道路？在这个问题上，历来存在着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争。我们伟大领袖毛主席早就指出：“革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合。”这是知识青年革命化的唯一正确道路，是培养和造就无产阶级革命事业接班人的百年大计、千年大计、万年大计！但是，中国赫鲁晓夫却大肆贩卖“吃小亏，占大便宜”的资产阶级市侩哲学。他恬不知耻地对立志上山下乡的知识青年说：“你们是中国第一代有文化的农民，第一代是要得便宜的。”“……我劝你们回乡后不当干部，认真地种三五年地，……具备三个条件（指会种地，有文化，跟农民关系好）就能当乡、县、省干部，也可以到中央，那就看各个人本事了。”在这个党内最大的走资派眼里，无论是读书、升学，还是上山下乡，统统不过是个人升官发财、成名成家的手段。他妄想用这些腐烂透顶的资产阶级黑货，把青年拉进修正主义泥坑，真是罪该万死！
    旧师大一附中，也是两个阶级争夺青年一代的激烈战场。它是旧北京市委鼓吹的“名牌”“尖子”学校。我校的走资派十几年来忠实地执行中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线，千方百计阻止广大革命学生走与工农相结合的道路。他们胡说什么：“不谈升学是不符合党的教育方针的”，并且极力标榜这个学校历年的升学率多么高，拚命引导学生追求升学，考“名牌”大学。好象这个学校出来的学生就只能升学，不能上山下乡。这是谁的“教育方针”？以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部什么时候规定过只准升学、不能上山下乡的教育方针？没有！从来也没有！
    知识青年上山下乡，与工农相结合，是彻底铲除修正主义根子的重大措施。我们革命青年，坚决走毛主席指引的这条光明大道，不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕累，一心为革命，一心为人民，到农村去，到边疆去，到祖国最需要的地方去，用我们的实际行动，粉碎修正主义教育路线，表达出我们对毛主席的一片忠心！
    我们即将离开北京，离开毛主席的身旁，奔赴阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验的三大斗争中去。我们人虽然离北京远了，心离毛主席更近了。我们身在边疆，心向北京城。最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席啊！您放心吧！我们一定永远读您的书，听您的话，照您的指示办事，活学活用“老三篇”，彻底改造世界观，做您的好战士！我们要把自己的全部青春以至生命献给边疆的革命事业。决不辜负您老人家对我们的期望！
    革命在召唤，人民在召唤！“毛主席挥手我前进”，有志气有抱负的革命青年，响应毛主席的号召，到农村去，到边疆去！沿着毛主席指引的知识分子革命化的大道勇往直前，永不回头！
      “我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业。
    我们的目的一定要达到。
    我们的目的一定能够达到。”

    北京一批革命知识青年坚决走伟大领袖毛主席指出的与工农相结合的光明大道，踊跃奔赴农村、边疆，到祖国最需要的地方去。出发之前，他们来到天安门前，向伟大领袖毛主席庄严宣誓，决心在阶级斗争的大风大浪中把自己锻炼成为无产阶级革命事业可靠的接班人。
