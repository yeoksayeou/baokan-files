The New China News Agency reported on the 3rd that according to the Albanian News Agency, the Albanian "People's Voice" published an article on the 1st, exposing and condemning the "Emergency Powers Law" passed by the West German Federal Parliament as another major step by the Bonn militarists towards the fascist road.

The article points out that the purpose of the West German authorities in implementing the "Emergency Powers Law" is to further accelerate the process of national fascization and militarization on a larger scale than at present, and to encourage the revived Nazi forces that have already taken a strong position in the state and the army. The article says, the "Emergency Powers Law" is closely related to Bonn's aggressive policy internationally. Therefore, Washington highly praises the efforts of the Kissinger government to implement the "Emergency Powers Law."

The article further points out that in fact, the Khrushchev revisionists have fueled Bonn's adventurous actions. Although Brezhnev, Kosygin and the like shout loudly against the revival of Nazism in the Federal Republic of Germany, they are constantly colluding with West German militarists and advocating that the Kissinger government has already shown obvious "realistic tendencies." They are strengthening their comprehensive relations with the Federal Republic of Germany in order to consolidate the "bridge" between imperialism and revisionism.

The article concludes by pointing out that recently, West German workers, students, and other progressive people have held protests and demonstrations against the "Emergency Powers Law." No matter how the West German ruling authorities deceive or take police terror actions, they cannot suppress this powerful movement.

    阿《人民之声报》揭露美帝指使西德议会强行通过反革命法案的阴谋
    “紧急状态法”使西德加速法西斯化
    苏修集团不断同西德军国主义勾勾搭搭助长了波恩的冒险行动
    新华社三日讯　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道，阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》一日发表文章，揭露和谴责西德联邦议会通过的“紧急状态法”是波恩军国主义者走向法西斯道路的又一个重大步骤。
    文章指出，西德当局实行“紧急状态法”的目的是要以比目前更大的规模进一步加速国家法西斯化和军国主义化的过程，鼓励已经复活并在国家和军队中取得了有力地位的新纳粹势力。文章说，“紧急状态法”同波恩在国际上所奉行的侵略政策密切相关。因此，华盛顿非常夸奖基辛格政府为实施“紧急状态法”所作的努力。
    文章接着指出，事实上，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者助长了波恩的冒险行动。勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流尽管蛊惑人心地大叫大嚷反对德意志联邦共和国复活新纳粹主义，但又不断地同西德军国主义者勾勾搭搭，并且鼓吹什么基辛格政府目前已明显表现出“现实主义倾向”。他们为了巩固帝国主义和修正主义之间的“桥梁”，正在加强同德意志联邦共和国的全面关系。
    文章最后指出，西德工人、学生和其他进步人民最近纷纷举行抗议示威，反对“紧急状态法”，不管西德统治当局欺骗也好，采取警察恐怖行动也好，都不能把这一声势浩大的运动压下去。
