The military representative of the Revolutionary Committee of Jiangxi New China Printing Factory, Comrade Ling Jiahai, emphasizes proletarian politics and carries forward the Three-Eight style, receiving praise from the revolutionary masses of the factory. They say: "Our military representative is truly excellent!"

In Jiangxi New China Printing Factory, from the office of the Revolutionary Committee to the workshops, from the workers' dormitories to the canteen, one often sees a soldier. Everyone affectionately calls him Old Ling.

Old Ling, Ling Jiahai, is a deputy battalion commander of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army. When he came to New China Printing Factory with the task of supporting the left, the first time he entered the printing workshop, seeing the rotating printing machines and the revolutionary treasures, the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," his heart was filled with excitement. He thought: This is an important front for spreading Mao Zedong Thought; we must indeed help the proletarian revolutionary cadres of the factory to grasp the leadership power!

On February 20, the Revolutionary Committee of Jiangxi New China Printing Factory was established, and Ling Jiahai was elected as the military representative of the "three-in-one combination."

As a military representative, Comrade Ling Jiahai, from the very first day of the establishment of the factory Revolutionary Committee, has resolutely defended this new revolutionary committee, together with the proletarian revolutionary cadres and the broad revolutionary masses of the entire factory, launching a fierce attack against a handful of class enemies. To consolidate and develop the new revolutionary committee, he particularly paid attention to bringing the political work experience and the Three-Eight style of the army into the Revolutionary Committee. When he learned that the workshop level only had technical group leaders, he thought that the technical work in the workshops was busy, and having only technical group leaders was not conducive to emphasizing proletarian politics. He actively proposed to the Revolutionary Committee the suggestion of setting up political group leaders at the workshop level. In the Revolutionary Committee, he also introduced the experience of army political work cadres in emphasizing politics. The Revolutionary Committee adopted his suggestion, thereby strengthening political work.

Once, Comrade Ling Jiahai returned from an external meeting and heard that a young committee member had lost his temper while talking to an old worker, resulting in an unpleasant ending. Ling Jiahai knew that this young comrade had enthusiasm and initiative, but lacked experience in patient and detailed ideological and political work. That evening, Ling Jiahai found this young committee member and together they repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "The reform of state organs, the most fundamental point, is to link up with the masses." The two had a heart-to-heart talk, understanding the great significance of Chairman Mao's teachings, and summing up the lessons of some cadres who had committed errors by being detached from the masses. Under Ling Jiahai's enthusiastic help, this young committee member quickly recognized his shortcomings and sincerely apologized to the old worker. From then on, he became more patient in doing ideological and political work.

Although Comrade Ling Jiahai is very busy with work, he always finds time to go down to the workshops to labor with the workers and has learned some general printing techniques. The masses are willing to talk to him and discuss matters with him. His style of closely linking with the masses also influenced other members of the Revolutionary Committee. The chairman of the Revolutionary Committee was originally the factory party committee secretary, who did not often go down to the workshops to labor. Once, he labored in the workshops with Ling Jiahai and saw that Ling Jiahai was very familiar with the workers and quite skilled in operations, which inspired him greatly, making him more conscious of participating in labor.

In the factory Revolutionary Committee, Comrade Ling Jiahai goes to bed the latest and gets up the earliest every day. Every night, no matter how late it is, he always goes to the workshops for a round before resting. A deputy chairman of the factory Revolutionary Committee asked him why he always makes a round at night before resting. He said: "In the regiment, it's a habit to inspect the sentry duty every night, to check the mosquito nets for the soldiers in the summer, and to cover them with blankets in the winter; I can't sleep without making a round." The deputy chairman was deeply moved and followed him to the workshops for a round, gradually forming the habit.

Comrade Ling Jiahai often says: "In the Revolutionary Committee, I am just a servant and a student." He believes that although he is an ordinary committee member in the Revolutionary Committee, because he represents the army, he often receives special respect from people. In this situation, he must especially respect other comrades and respect the Revolutionary Committee. The factory Revolutionary Committee has a deputy chairman who is a young revolutionary cadre in her twenties. She is not only a deputy chairman of the factory but also a committee member of the Nanchang Municipal Revolutionary Committee and a member of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee. Every time she comes to the factory, Comrade Ling Jiahai always actively reports the work situation to her. Surrounding people were puzzled: Ling Jiahai is the military representative, why does he always rush to report to this young revolutionary cadre? Someone asked him, and he replied: "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'All our cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people.' The military representative is a servant of the Revolutionary Committee. I have the duty to report to her. She works in the provincial and municipal Revolutionary Committees, following Chairman Mao closely, understanding the spirit from above quickly. She also needs to understand the situation of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions below. We should exchange information. I respect her, which is respecting the Revolutionary Committee."

Comrade Ling Jiahai's firm political stance and excellent style of thinking have received praise from the broad revolutionary masses of the factory. They say: "Our military representative is truly excellent!"

专栏：革命委员会好

    江西省新华印刷厂革委会中的军队代表凌佳海同志，突出无产阶级政治，发扬三八作风，受到厂里广大革命群众的称赞。他们说：“
    咱们的军队代表就是好！”
    在江西省新华印刷厂，从革委会的办公室到车间，从工人宿舍到食堂，经常可以看到一位解放军同志。人们都亲切地喊他老凌。
    老凌，凌佳海，是解放军某部的副营长。当他带着支左的任务，来到新华印刷厂，第一次走进印刷车间的时候，看着飞转的印刷机，看着一本本革命的宝书《毛泽东选集》，心里兴奋极了。他想：这里是一个传播毛泽东思想的重要阵地，我们可要切实帮助厂里的无产阶级革命派掌握好领导权啊！
    二月二十日，江西新华印刷厂革命委员会成立了，凌佳海被推选为“三结合”的军队代表。
    作为军队代表，凌佳海同志从厂革委会成立的第一天起，就坚决捍卫这个新生的革命委员会，同全厂无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众一道，向一小撮阶级敌人发动了猛烈的进攻。为了巩固和发展新生的革命委员会，他特别注意把部队的政治工作经验和三八作风带进革委会。当他了解到车间一级只有业务组长时，就想，车间业务工作忙，只设业务组长，不利于突出无产阶级政治。他积极向革委会提出在车间一级设政治组长的建议。在革委会上，他还介绍了部队政治工作干部抓突出政治的经验。革委会采纳了他的建议，从而加强了政治工作。
    有一次，凌佳海同志从外面开会回来，听说一个年轻的常委在和一位老工人谈话时发了脾气，闹得不欢而散。凌佳海知道这位青年同志有热情，有闯劲，但还缺乏做耐心的、细致的思想政治工作的经验。晚上，凌佳海找到这位年轻的常委，和他一起反复地学习了毛主席的教导：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”两个人促膝谈心，领会毛主席这一教导的伟大意义，总结过去有些干部脱离群众，犯错误的教训。在凌佳海的热情帮助下，这位年轻常委很快认识了自己的缺点，主动向那位老工人做了诚恳的检讨。从此，他做思想政治工作就耐心多了。
    凌佳海同志虽然工作很忙，但总是抽时间下到车间和工人们一道劳动，并且学会了一般的印刷技术。群众有话愿意对他讲，有事愿意同他商量。他密切联系群众的作风也影响了革委会的其他成员。革命委员会主任是原来的厂党委书记，过去不大下车间劳动。有一次，他和凌佳海一块到车间劳动，见凌佳海和工人搞得很熟，操作技术也挺熟练，受到很大启发，参加劳动也比过去自觉了。
    在厂革命委员会里，凌佳海同志每天睡的最晚，起的最早。每天晚上，不管多晚，他总是到车间里去转一转才休息。厂革委会的一位副主任问他，为什么晚上总是要转一遭才休息？他说：“在连队里习惯了，每天晚上要查哨，夏天为战士看看蚊帐，冬天为战士盖盖被子，不转一趟就睡不着觉。”这位副主任听了很受感动，便跟他一块到车间去转，慢慢地也形成了习惯。
    凌佳海同志常说：“我在革命委员会中，就是当一名勤务员，当一名小学生。”他认为，自己在革委会中，虽然是一名普通的常委，但是因为代表着军队一个方面，往往受到人们的特别尊重。在这种情况下，就要特别注意尊重其他同志，尊重革命委员会。厂革命委员会有一个副主任，是个年龄二十出头的革命小将。她不仅是厂里的副主任，还是南昌市革命委员会的常委、省革命委员会的委员。每次她到厂里来的时候，凌佳海同志总是主动地向她汇报工作情况。周围的人看了，心里有些纳闷：凌佳海同志是军队代表，为啥总是抢先向这位年轻的小将去汇报呢？有人去问他，他回答说：“毛主席教导我们：‘我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员’。军队代表就是革命委员会的勤务员，我有义务向她汇报请示。她在省、市革命委员会工作，跟毛主席跟得紧，理解上面精神快，她也很需要了解下面落实毛主席最新指示的情况，我们应当互通情报。我尊重她，也就是尊重革命委员会。”
    凌佳海同志坚定的政治立场和优良的思想作风，受到厂里广大革命群众的称赞。他们说：“咱们的军队代表就是好！”
