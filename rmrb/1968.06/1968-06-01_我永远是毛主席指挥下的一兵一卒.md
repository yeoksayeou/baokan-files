	In 1966, we were assigned along with Comrade Menhe to participate in the “Four Clean-ups” movement in Donghe Commune, Huzhu Tu Autonomous County, Qinghai Province. At that time, a small clique of capitalist roaders within the Party and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in the commune colluded with each other, launching a frenzied attack on socialism. Faced with the severe class struggle, Comrade Menhe realized that the great thought of Mao Zedong is the most powerful ideological weapon to defeat all class enemies. He must mobilize and arm the masses with Mao Zedong Thought. With boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, he devoted his utmost effort to launching a mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works in the production brigade. During the day, he labored with the masses, bringing the precious books and quotations to the fields. At night, despite his fatigue, he guided everyone in studying Chairman Mao’s works under the kerosene lamp. Whether it rained or shone, he never stopped. Under his efforts, the brigade’s study of Chairman Mao’s works became lively and vibrant, with many touching scenes of mutual teaching and learning. The masses were truly mobilized and actively participated in the “Four Clean-ups” movement.

	However, Comrade Menhe’s practice of guiding the “Four Clean-ups” movement with Mao Zedong Thought encountered resistance from all sides. The biggest capitalist roader in the Northwest region attempted to use the slogan “oppose peaceful ‘Four Clean-ups’” to oppose the study and application of Chairman Mao’s works and to oppose the education of the masses and cadres with Mao Zedong Thought. Menhe firmly remembered Chairman Mao’s teaching that “political work is the lifeline of all economic work” and persisted in organizing the masses to study and apply Chairman Mao’s works. He organized the brigade’s militia to set up quotation boards everywhere in the village streets and alleys, leading the commune members to hold various reporting meetings.

	The “Twenty-three Articles” personally drafted by Chairman Mao are the great guideline for the rural “Four Clean-ups” movement. Comrade Menhe deeply understood that the struggle between the “Twenty-three Articles” and the “Peach Garden Experience” concocted by the Chinese Khrushchev is a head-on confrontation between two classes, two lines, and two roads. Standing on Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line means strictly implementing the “Twenty-three Articles.” He deeply grasped the spirit of the “Twenty-three Articles,” which states, “The focus of this movement is to rectify those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.” He always used Mao Zedong Thought to unite and educate the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and the majority of revolutionary cadres, directing the struggle against the small clique of capitalist roaders within the Party and exposing the class enemy who had infiltrated the Party for many years and held leading positions in the brigade. Thus, he severely struck down the counter-revolutionary arrogance of a small clique of class enemies and deeply educated the broad masses of cadres and the people.

	“Serve the people wholeheartedly and never leave the masses.” Comrade Menhe implemented this great teaching of Chairman Mao in every word and deed. When the rainy season came, seeing that the houses of two poor peasant families of military dependents were about to collapse from the rain, he immediately organized Party members and brigade poor peasant association committee members to study Chairman Mao’s brilliant works “In Memory of Norman Bethune” and “Pay Attention to Methods of Work” and mobilized everyone to repair the houses for the two military families. Under Comrade Menhe’s leadership, the broad masses of poor peasants in the village displayed a high sense of class brotherhood and quickly built eight new rooms. The two old poor peasants, with tears in their eyes, looked at Chairman Mao’s portrait and excitedly said, “Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You know our hardships best. The good soldier you have educated, Menhe, is truly close to our hearts!”

	Menhe’s heart is forever connected with the masses. He has only the masses in his heart and nothing else. Once, Menhe contracted dysentery. To prevent the disease from spreading to the masses, he endured severe pain and buried his feces outside the village every time, even when he was too weak to get out of bed. Menhe always thought of the masses, and the masses also cared for Menhe. When they saw that Menhe’s condition was worsening, they repeatedly urged him to go to the hospital and even used a cart to send him to the city hospital. However, Menhe stayed in the hospital for only two days, his illness not yet cured, and returned to the brigade, back to the masses.

	Menhe, with his actual actions, fulfilled his oath: “I am forever a soldier under Chairman Mao’s command, and only by being with the masses of thousands and millions can I exert my greatest fighting power and defeat the enemy’s ‘chariots, horses, and cannons’!”

	Today, as we recall Menhe and learn from him, we are determined to follow the heroic path, bravely fight to defend Chairman Mao, defend Mao Zedong Thought, and defend Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line!

    “我永远是毛主席指挥下的一兵一卒”
    ——记门合同志在“四清”运动中的事迹
    解放军某部　姚学信　吕少松　宋念谦　詹忠富
    一九六六年，我们和门合同志一起被分配在青海省互助土族自治县东和公社参加“四清”运动。当时这个公社的党内一小撮走资派和没有改造好的地富反坏右分子，互相勾结，猖狂地向社会主义进攻。在严峻的阶级斗争面前，门合同志认识到，伟大的毛泽东思想是战胜一切阶级敌人最强大的思想武器，必须用毛泽东思想发动群众、武装群众。他怀着对毛主席的无限忠诚，用最大的精力，在生产大队开展了活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。白天，他和群众一起劳动，把宝书和语录牌带到田边地头。深夜，他不顾一天的疲劳，在煤油灯下辅导大家学习毛主席著作。不管天晴下雨，从不间断。在他的努力下，大队学习毛主席著作搞得热气腾腾，出现了许多互教互学的动人情景。群众真正发动起来了，积极地投入了“四清”运动。
    但是，门合同志用毛泽东思想指导“四清”运动的做法，却遇到了各方面的阻力。西北地区党内最大的走资派企图以“大反和平‘四清’”为名，反对活学活用毛主席著作，反对用毛泽东思想教育群众和干部。门合牢记毛主席“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导，坚持不懈地组织群众活学活用毛主席著作。他组织大队的民兵，在村子的街头巷尾，到处树起毛主席语录牌，带领社员召开各种讲用会。
    毛主席亲自主持制定的“二十三条”，是农村“四清”运动的伟大纲领。门合同志深深懂得，“二十三条”，和中国赫鲁晓夫一手炮制的“桃园经验”的斗争，是针锋相对的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争。站在毛主席的革命路线一边，就必须不折不扣地贯彻执行“二十三条”。他深刻领会“二十三条”中指示的
  “这次运动的重点，是整党内那些走资本主义道路的当权派”的精神，始终用毛泽东思想团结教育广大贫下中农和绝大多数革命干部，把斗争矛头指向党内一小撮走资派，揪出了混入我党多年并担任大队领导工作的阶级异己分子。这样，就狠狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人的反革命气焰，深刻地教育了广大干部和群众。
      “全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众”。门合同志把毛主席的这一伟大教导，贯彻在他的一言一行中。雨季来临了，当他看到两户贫农军属的房子快要被雨淋塌的时候，他立即组织党员和大队贫协委员学习毛主席的《为人民服务》和《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》等光辉著作，发动大家给两户军属修房子。在门合同志的带领下，村子里的广大贫下中农，发扬高度阶级友爱精神，迅速盖起八间新房。两户老贫农含着泪花，望着毛主席的画像，激动地说：“毛主席啊，毛主席！您老人家最了解我们的疾苦，您教育出来的好战士门合，和我们是心贴心啊！”
    门合的心永远和群众连结在一起。他心里只有群众，唯独没有他自己。有一次，门合得了中毒性痢疾。为了不使痢疾传染给群众，他在病得很难起床的情况下，每次都忍着剧烈的疼痛，把粪便埋到村外。门合处处为群众着想，群众也事事关心门合。当他们看到门合的病情越来越严重时，就一而再、再而三地催促他住院，并且用马车把他送到城里医院。可是门合没住两天，病未痊愈，就又回到大队，回到群众中来了。
    门合用自己的实际行动，实现了他的誓言：“我永远是毛主席指挥下的一兵一卒，只有和千百万群众在一起，才能发挥最大的战斗力，吃掉敌人的‘车马炮’！”
    今天，我们回忆门合，学习门合，决心沿着英雄的道路，为保卫毛主席，保卫毛泽东思想，保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线而英勇地战斗！
