Military representatives participating in the revolutionary committees of the Liaoning Provincial Sericulture Research Institute and the Liaoning Provincial Sericulture School, when encountering issues, are good at consulting with other committee members and fully utilizing the collective leadership's role. They—

Bring the fine tradition of political democracy from the PLA into the revolutionary committee.

Military representatives participating in the revolutionary committees of the Liaoning Provincial Sericulture Research Institute and the Liaoning Provincial Sericulture School, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instruction to "rely on the implementation of the Party's democratic centralism to mobilize the enthusiasm of the entire Party," have brought the glorious tradition of political democracy from the PLA into the revolutionary committee.

These military representatives, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, firmly stood on the side of the revolutionary masses, and built deep class feelings with the revolutionary masses, shoulder to shoulder. After the revolutionary committee was established, they participated in the "three-in-one" leadership cadre. Whenever the revolutionary committee held a meeting to discuss issues or formulate resolutions, other committee members all hoped that the military representatives would express their opinions and speak. Once the military representatives expressed their opinions, everyone's minds would be at ease.

Facing this situation, the military representatives studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "People's work is different, their positions are different, but no matter how high the position, among the people, one must appear as an ordinary worker." They believed that the more other committee members respected the military representatives, the more the military representatives should be humble and cautious, regarding themselves as ordinary soldiers. Only by placing themselves among other committee members, carrying forward the glorious tradition of military political democracy, and fostering a democratic style of "group discussion," could the collective leadership of the revolutionary committee be fully utilized. From then on, the military representatives paid more attention to fully consulting with the committee members when encountering issues. When problems arose, they took the initiative to assume responsibility and conduct self-criticism first; during study sessions, they took the lead in exposing their own shortcomings; when researching issues or formulating plans and resolutions, they always let other committee members speak first. Whenever the revolutionary committee issued a call, they responded enthusiastically; when issuing instructions and resolutions, they led by example; when formulating rules and regulations, they complied first.

When there were differing opinions and disputes among the committee members, the military representatives did not simply express their opinions but instead encouraged everyone to fully debate and unify their thoughts through Mao Zedong Thought. Once, when discussing the handling of workers' absenteeism, some committee members advocated solving the problem by deducting wages. Some committee members disagreed with this approach. In the face of differing opinions, everyone asked the deputy director of the revolutionary committee, military representative Fan Xishui, to express his opinion. Fan Xishui did not act as a "referee" but instead encouraged everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "grasping ideological education, which is the central link in uniting the entire Party to engage in great political struggles." As a result, the committee members unanimously agreed to strengthen ideological education work. The military representatives learned from this incident that fully fostering a democratic style of "group discussion," allowing everyone to use Mao Zedong Thought to research, handle issues, and formulate resolutions, could better implement and carry out Chairman Mao's series of instructions.

The military representatives believed that the collective leadership of the revolutionary committee must adhere to Mao Zedong Thought as the criterion. Once, the political work group proposed spending more than 2,000 yuan to set up a learning environment. When the revolutionary committee discussed this issue, they believed that setting up a learning environment to propagate Mao Zedong Thought was worth spending more money on. This meeting, the military representatives did not attend due to unforeseen circumstances. When the military representatives learned about this matter, they studied Chairman Mao's instructions on "frugality in revolution" with the committee members, making everyone realize that learning and propagating Mao Zedong Thought is the sacred duty of every revolutionary, but setting up a learning environment should follow Chairman Mao's teachings and strive for frugality. After raising their awareness, they fostered a spirit of self-reliance and mobilized the masses to contribute ideas, resulting in the learning environment being set up with very little money.

After the military representatives brought the democratic style of "group discussion" into the revolutionary committee, the democratic atmosphere in the revolutionary committee became increasingly strong. The committee members praised:

"The military representatives brought us the fine democratic style of the people's army and also set a good example of being an ordinary soldier for us."

    参加辽宁省蚕业科学研究所、辽宁省蚕业学校革委会的军队代表，遇事善于和其他委员商量，充分发挥集体领导的作用。他们——
    把解放军政治民主的好传统带进革委会
    参加辽宁省蚕业科学研究所、辽宁省蚕业学校革命委员会的军队代表，遵照毛主席“依靠实行党的民主集中制去发动全党的积极性”的教导，把解放军政治民主的光荣传统带进了革命委员会。
    这些军队代表在无产阶级文化大革命中，坚定地站在无产阶级革命派一边，和革命群众心连心，肩并肩，建立了深厚的阶级感情，在群众中有很高的威信。革命委员会成立以后，他们参加了“三结合”的领导班子。每逢革委会开会研究问题，制定决议，其他委员都希望军队代表表态、发言。军队代表一表态，大家心里就有了着落。
    面对这种情况，军队代表学习了毛主席的教导：“人们的工作有所不同，职务有所不同，但是任何人不论官有多大，在人民中间都要以一个普通劳动者的姿态出现。”他们认为，其他委员越是尊重军队代表，军队代表越应该谦虚、谨慎，把自己看成是普通一兵。只有把自己摆在其他委员之中，发扬军队政治民主的光荣传统，发扬“群言堂”的民主作风，才能充分发挥革委会的集体领导作用。从这以后，军队代表遇事更加注意和委员们充分商量。出了问题时，他们主动承担责任，先做检查；参加学习时，他们带头亮私斗私；研究问题或制订计划、决议时，他们总是先让其他委员发言。革委会每发出一个号召，他们带头响应；做出指示、决议，带头执行；制订了规章制度，带头遵守。
    当大家意见有分歧，争执不下的时候，军队代表不是简单地表态，而是启发大家充分展开辩论，用毛泽东思想统一认识。有一次，在研究对职工误假的处理问题时，部分委员主张用扣工资的办法解决。有的委员不同意这种做法。在意见分歧的情况下，大家要革委会副主任、军队代表范希睢同志表态。范希睢同志没有当“裁判员”，而是启发大家学习毛主席关于“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节”的教导。结果，委员们一致同意要加强思想教育工作。军队代表从这件事中体会到，充分发扬“群言堂”的民主作风，让大家用毛泽东思想研究、处理问题，制订决议，就能使毛主席一系列指示得到更好的贯彻、落实。
    军队代表认为，革命委员会的集体领导，必须以符合毛泽东思想为准则。一次，政工组提出要用二千多元布置学习环境。革委会在研究这个问题时，认为布置学习环境，宣传毛泽东思想，多花一些钱也值得。这次会，军队代表因故没有参加。当军队代表知道这件事后，便和委员们一起学习毛主席关于“要节约闹革命”的指示，使大家认识到：学习和宣传毛泽东思想是每一个革命者的神圣职责，但是布置学习环境，应当按照毛主席的教导，力求节约。大家提高认识以后，发扬自力更生的精神，发动群众献计献策，结果花了不多的钱就把学习环境布置起来了。
    军队代表把“群言堂”的作风带进革委会以后，革委会的民主空气越来越浓。委员们称赞说：
  “军队代表给我们带来了人民军队政治民主的好作风，也为我们树立了当好普通一兵的好榜样。”
