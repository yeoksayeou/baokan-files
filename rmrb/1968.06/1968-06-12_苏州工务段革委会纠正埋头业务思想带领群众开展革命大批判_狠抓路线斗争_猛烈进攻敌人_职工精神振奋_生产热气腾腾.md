The Revolutionary Committee of Suzhou Railway Section of Shanghai Railway Bureau, after its establishment, had some members who, when discussing current tasks, said: "The Railway Section is responsible for the tracks. Now railway transportation is busy, we should focus on the tracks; otherwise, if an accident happens, the newly established Revolutionary Committee will lose its authority."

This viewpoint aroused deep reflection among other members and the PLA personnel who were carrying out support-left tasks in the section. They unanimously believed that whether to build the Revolutionary Committee into a production command center or into a combat command center for learning, propagating, executing, and defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the fundamental issue that the Revolutionary Committee must first resolve. To this end, the PLA support-left personnel helped the Revolutionary Committee members to repeatedly and seriously study Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution under the conditions of socialism, a revolution by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its leadership of the broad revolutionary masses and the reactionary Kuomintang, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Through study, everyone unanimously recognized that after the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, there are thousands of things to do, but the most important thing is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, earnestly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and focus on the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, launching a fierce attack on the class enemy. If class struggle and line struggle are not grasped, and one buries oneself in business, it will be a serious mistake. Implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions will become an empty slogan, the proletarian revolutionary power will lose its combat effectiveness, and it will gradually change color, making it impossible to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Li Xingyi, the chairman of the Revolutionary Committee and the former party secretary, said: "In the past, I was poisoned by the 'theory of the extinction of class struggle' of the Chinese Khrushchev, focusing only on the smooth operation of the tracks and not on the line struggle. This is like sleeping with one's head on the enemy's chopping block, not knowing how one's head was cut off. Now I realize that the two eyes of revolutionary fighters must not only see the tracks but also see the line struggle. We must hold on to class struggle and line struggle!"

After reaching a consensus, everyone unanimously agreed to grasp the string of class struggle, keeping it taut at all times, and not relaxing for a moment. They further laid out the new situation, new circumstances, new trends, and new characteristics of class struggle in the section, realizing that the class enemy has not been sleeping, and they are still making their last struggles. Those unrepentant capitalist roaders and traitors, spies, and landlords, counter-revolutionaries, rich peasants, bad elements, and rightists who have infiltrated the revolutionary ranks are colluding to stir up a reversal wind, sowing discord among revolutionary masses, disrupting production, and attempting to sabotage the newly established Revolutionary Committee. These living class struggle facts further opened everyone's eyes.

Members of the Revolutionary Committee, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "never forget class struggle," went deep into various work areas, together with the revolutionary masses, investigated the movements of the class enemy, studied combat strategies, chose breakthroughs, found the main attack direction, and led the masses to launch a fierce attack on the class enemy. Facing the powerful offensive of the revolutionary masses, a handful of class enemies sensed their doom approaching, hiding in dark corners and releasing waves of evil winds, more cunningly inciting discord among revolutionary masses, attempting to struggle desperately and resist the powerful offensive of the revolutionary masses. With the help of PLA support-left personnel, the Revolutionary Committee members immediately went deep into the masses, combining the living thoughts of the masses, studying Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle with the masses, making the masses further realize that our struggle with a handful of class enemies is a continuation of the long-term struggle with the reactionary Kuomintang, a life-and-death class struggle, and we must not give the enemy a chance to breathe and counterattack, otherwise, we cannot carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. The broad masses raised their awareness and launched an even fiercer attack on the class enemy, resolutely exposing the traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionary two-faced elements who had infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, and severely criticized the unrepentant capitalist roaders.

Chairman Mao taught: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism, is revolution. Destruction must be reasoned, and reasoning is construction. With destruction as the main focus, construction is also within it." The PLA support-left personnel believed that the Revolutionary Committee members had the mistaken idea of managing tracks without concerning themselves with line struggle because the poison of the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" spread by the Chinese Khrushchev had not been eliminated. Only by grasping the weapon of revolutionary criticism to attack the class enemy, deeply and thoroughly criticizing the set of revisionist black goods of the Chinese Khrushchev, can Chairman Mao's latest instructions take deep root in the minds of the broad masses. Therefore, they actively helped the Revolutionary Committee to mobilize the masses to grasp the living targets in their units, connect them with the Chinese Khrushchev, and carry out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, launching continuous attacks on the class enemy. Through revolutionary criticism, the masses' awareness of class struggle and line struggle was greatly enhanced, and their initiative and consciousness in attacking the class enemy were improved.

After repeated struggles with the class enemy, Chairman Mao's latest instructions took deep root in the minds of the broad revolutionary masses of Suzhou Railway Section, the revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary masses was more vibrant, and the authority of the Revolutionary Committee was increasingly high. The entire section presented a scene of revolutionary fervor and production enthusiasm. The more than 300 miles of railway lines managed by Suzhou Railway Section were free of accidents, ensuring the safe and smooth operation of trains.

    苏州工务段革委会纠正埋头业务思想带领群众开展革命大批判
    狠抓路线斗争　猛烈进攻敌人  职工精神振奋　生产热气腾腾
    新华社南京电　上海铁路局苏州工务段革委会成立后，有些成员在讨论当前任务的时候说：“工务段是管线路的。现在铁路运输繁忙，应该抓线路了；要不然，出了事故，新成立的革委会就没有威信了。”
    这种看法，引起了其他一些成员和在段上担任支左任务的解放军同志的深思。他们一致认为：究竟把革委会建设成为生产指挥部，还是建设成为学习、宣传、执行和捍卫毛主席无产阶级革命路线的战斗指挥部，这是革委会必须首先解决的根本问题。为此，解放军支左人员帮助革委会成员反复认真地学习了毛主席的最新指示：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”通过学习，大家一致认识到，革委会成立后，有千件事、万件事要抓，但是头等重要的事，是要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，认真落实毛主席的最新指示，狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，向阶级敌人发动猛烈的进攻。如果不抓阶级斗争、路线斗争，一头钻到业务圈子里去，就会犯绝大的错误，落实毛主席的最新指示就成了一句空话，无产阶级革命政权就没有战斗力，就会慢慢改变颜色，就不能夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。革委会主任、原党委书记李兴义说：“过去我就是中了中国赫鲁晓夫‘阶级斗争熄灭’论的毒，只抓线路畅通，不抓路线斗争。这真象把头枕在敌人的铡刀上睡觉，脑袋掉了还不知道怎么掉的。现在我认识到，我们革命战士的两只眼睛，决不能只看到线路，看不到路线斗争。我们就是要抓住阶级斗争和路线斗争不放！”
    大家统一认识后，一致表示要抓住阶级斗争这根弦，时时刻刻拉得紧紧的，决不能有半点松劲。他们还进一步大摆了本段当前阶级斗争的新形势，新情况，新动向，新特点，看清了阶级敌人并没有睡觉，他们还在作垂死挣扎。那些死不悔改的走资派和混进革命队伍的叛徒、特务，和地富反坏右分子勾结在一起，刮起了一股翻案妖风，离间革命群众的团结，破坏生产，妄图搞垮新生的革委会。这些活生生的阶级斗争事实，进一步擦亮了大家的眼睛。
    革委会成员们遵照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，纷纷深入各工区，同革命群众一道，调查阶级敌人的动向，研究斗争策略，选择突破口，找准主攻方向，带领群众向阶级敌人发起了猛烈的进攻。在革命群众的强大攻势面前，一小撮阶级敌人预感到末日来临，躲在阴暗角落放出阵阵妖风，更加阴险地挑拨离间革命群众的关系，妄图垂死挣扎，抵挡革命群众的强大攻势。革委会成员在解放军支左人员的帮助下，立刻分头深入到群众之中，结合群众的活思想，同群众一起学习毛主席有关阶级斗争的教导，使群众进一步认识到：我们同一小撮阶级敌人的斗争，是和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是一场你死我活的阶级斗争，决不能给敌人得到喘息和重新反扑的机会，否则，就不能把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。广大群众提高了认识，向阶级敌人发起了更加猛烈的进攻，坚决把混入革命队伍的叛徒、特务、反革命两面派挖了出来，并且狠狠地批判了死不悔改的走资派。
    毛主席教导说：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。”解放军支左人员认为，革委会成员所以会产生只管线路不问路线斗争的错误想法，是因为中国赫鲁晓夫散布的“阶级斗争熄灭”论的流毒没有肃清。只有掌握革命大批判这个向阶级敌人进攻的锐利武器，批深批透中国赫鲁晓夫的一套修正主义黑货，毛主席的最新指示才能在广大群众头脑中深深扎根。因此，他们积极帮助革委会发动群众抓住本单位的活靶子，同中国赫鲁晓夫挂上钩，开展深入持久的革命大批判，向阶级敌人发动了连续不断的进攻。通过革命大批判，大大提高了群众的阶级斗争观念和路线斗争觉悟，提高了向阶级敌人进攻的主动性和自觉性。
    经过和阶级敌人的反复较量，毛主席的最新指示在苏州工务段广大革命群众中深深扎了根，革命群众的革命精神更加焕发，革命委员会的威信愈来愈高，全段出现了革命轰轰烈烈，生产热气腾腾的大好局面。苏州工务段所管辖的三百多里铁道线路，杜绝了事故，保证了列车安全畅通。
