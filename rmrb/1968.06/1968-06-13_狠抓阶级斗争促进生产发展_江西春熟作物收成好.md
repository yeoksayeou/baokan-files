In the great situation of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Jiangxi Province's over 400 million mu of spring crops have generally been harvested successfully. The yield per unit area of rapeseed is generally about 10% higher than last year, and spring grains such as wheat, barley, and peas have also seen significant increases in yield.

Jiangxi's successful harvest of spring crops this year marks the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants' earnest implementation of the great leader Chairman Mao's directive to "grasp revolution, promote production," and it has fired the first shot in the struggle for a bumper harvest for the entire year. Since last winter and this spring, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have used revolution to lead production and drive production, strengthened the cultivation and management of spring crops, and spared no effort to achieve a bumper harvest. The entire province's famous rapeseed-producing area, Hukou County, has thoroughly implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest directives, with the revolution booming and production thriving. The enthusiasm of the peasants is sky-high, making this year's rapeseed yield 79% higher than last year and 5% higher than the highest yield in history. At the same time, the yield of crops such as barley and wheat has also exceeded the highest yield in history. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants enthusiastically acclaim this as a victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and a fruitful achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Jiangxi's rural areas have intensified class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, carried out thorough and in-depth revolutionary criticism, and in the struggle, launched a new high tide of the mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao Zedong Thought. This has powerfully promoted the thought revolutionization of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, and promoted the bumper harvest of spring agriculture.
