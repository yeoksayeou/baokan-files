Resolutely Defend Chairman Mao's Proletarian Revolutionary Line

Comrade Men He's heroic deeds have greatly educated and inspired me. Comrade Men He is indeed a hero who has fought to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line all his life. He is a good cadre who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. He is a shining example for us to learn from.

Only by carrying out "two revolutions" simultaneously can we defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

A ship needs a helmsman to navigate the sea, and a revolution needs Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Men He treats the study and application of Chairman Mao's works as his primary need in life. He is both the driving force and the object of the revolution. Comrade Men He's heroic deeds have raised a very important question for us: Under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, as the revolution deepens, to make our thoughts adapt to the new revolutionary situation, we must constantly study Chairman Mao's entire set of theories, lines, policies, and principles on continuing the revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship. We must persist in criticizing and repudiating revisionism and fighting against selfishness, constantly raising our consciousness of class struggle and struggle between lines. Only in this way can we keep up with Chairman Mao and, like Comrade Men He, "always stand guard, keep watch, and fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line."

At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, I once fell behind the new situation. Later, after studying Chairman Mao's series of instructions, I came to realize that under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, the main target of the revolution is the representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the organs of proletarian dictatorship, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. Our struggle with them is a life-and-death class struggle, a serious struggle between restoration and anti-restoration, a top-priority issue concerning whether China will change color or not. After realizing this, I actively joined the struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders in the original local and county Party committees.

At this time, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party regarded me as a thorn in their eye and a bone in their throat. They rallied the untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, distorted right and wrong, spread rumors, and deceived some of the masses who did not understand the true situation, launching attacks and struggles against me. At this time, because I understood the theory of continuing the revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship and recognized the counter-revolutionary nature of the handful of capitalist-roaders, the more ferocious they appeared, the greater my determination to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line became. Every day when we went to work in the fields, they forcibly separated me from the masses and did not allow me to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the masses. I would run to the windward side and loudly read Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the community members. When they dragged me to the county and commune for struggle sessions, I seized every opportunity to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the masses and to explain the principles of defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

In this intense and sharp class struggle, I deeply realized: To be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and to defend it to the death, one must dare to go against the wind and fight against the waves, rushing to the front line of struggle. Where there is difficulty, we charge forward; where there is danger, we fight.

Studying Comrade Men He's heroic deeds and linking them with my own struggle practice, I also deeply felt that while struggling against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, we must also struggle against the "self" in our minds. Public and private cannot "coexist peacefully." The more "self" there is, the less "public" there is. If we do not overthrow "self," when we encounter storms, we will hesitate and waver, even seeking refuge in a "safe harbor." Therefore, only by consciously criticizing and repudiating revisionism and fighting against selfishness can we cultivate a heart that is infinitely loving, believing, worshipping, and loyal to Chairman Mao, and be like Comrade Men He: "Always thinking of Chairman Mao, always following Chairman Mao, always for Chairman Mao."

Never forget class struggle, grasp the initiative in class struggle.

Chairman Mao profoundly pointed out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its led revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." The class enemy is always on the lookout for an opportunity to strike. If you do not strike them, they will strike you; if you relax, they will attack. Therefore, we must, like Comrade Men He, constantly and unremittingly use the class struggle viewpoint and class analysis method taught by Chairman Mao to study new problems in class struggle, understand and analyze the new trends of the class enemy, so as to grasp the initiative in class struggle. Otherwise, we will be at a loss in the complex class struggle and fall into a passive position.

In the first half of 1966, our brigade, after the "Four Clean-ups" movement, had a good situation in both revolution and production. If we had continued to grasp class struggle and unremittingly launched attacks on the class enemy, the situation would have been even better. However, we relaxed in this regard, so at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, we gave the class enemy the opportunity to counterattack. The untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists colluded with the bad elements exposed during the "Four Clean-ups," distorted right and wrong, confused black and white, deceived some of the masses who did not understand the true situation, and launched attacks on the revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses. Later, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses launched a counterattack against the class enemy, turning the situation around.

After that, we had two more confrontations with the class enemy. Through these three attacks on the class enemy, a large amount of shocking material made the cadres and masses see the sharpness and complexity of class struggle and received profound education. In this way, the class enemy became a trapped animal, and the initiative was completely in our hands.

Believe in the masses, rely on the masses to resolutely defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Chairman Mao recently instructed: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship."

Comrade Men He is a vanguard fighter who leads the revolutionary masses in fighting against the class enemy. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, resolutely supported the revolutionary leftists, and bravely sacrificed himself for defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and protecting the comrades of the proletarian revolutionary faction. Comrade Men He's heroic deeds made me further realize that only by remembering Chairman Mao's teaching can we organize a vast revolutionary army to deal with a handful of class enemies.

The deeper the proletarian feelings for the revolutionary masses, the closer the follow to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

A handful of unrepentant capitalist-roaders and class enemies, during the Cultural Revolution, deceived some of the masses who did not understand the true situation and launched attacks and struggles against me. I always remembered Chairman Mao's teaching to believe in the masses and rely on the masses, and I always joined the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to direct the struggle spearhead at a handful of class enemies and did not fall for the class enemy's tricks. Later, I also followed Chairman Mao's teaching and did political and ideological work for the deceived masses. Some comrades saw me going to do ideological work for a few people three or five times and said to me: "You are still trying to persuade these few people, you have forgotten the ferocity with which they followed the class enemy to struggle against you!" I persuaded and educated these comrades: The struggle between the two lines is not about personal "grievances" and we cannot "keep accounts" with the deceived masses; as long as they are comrades who want revolution, we must unite with them, otherwise we will deviate from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In this way, through patient political and ideological work, those deceived masses awakened and turned against the class enemy, quickly exposing the class enemy in broad daylight.

From the struggle practice, I felt that as a revolutionary cadre, one cannot just be a fighter but must also be a commander who can lead the broad masses to struggle against the class enemy. To be a good commander, one must maintain close contact with the masses, humbly learn from the masses, work and study with the masses.

In the future, I will definitely, in the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, on the front line of class struggle, with Comrade Men He as an example, with the help of the poor and lower-middle peasants, constantly find gaps and problems, and learn from Comrade Men He with my own gaps and problems. I will learn from the heroes, see the actions, and be like Comrade Men He: Always remember class struggle, always remember proletarian dictatorship, always emphasize politics, always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and launch even more fierce attacks on Liu Shaoqi and all class enemies, attack again and again, and carry out the political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes to the end!
