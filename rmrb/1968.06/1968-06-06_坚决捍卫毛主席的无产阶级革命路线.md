Resolutely Defend Chairman Mao's Proletarian Revolutionary Line

Comrade Men He's heroic deeds have greatly educated and inspired me. Comrade Men He is indeed a hero who has fought to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line all his life. He is a good cadre who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. He is a shining example for us to learn from.

Only by carrying out "two revolutions" simultaneously can we defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

A ship needs a helmsman to navigate the sea, and a revolution needs Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Men He treats the study and application of Chairman Mao's works as his primary need in life. He is both the driving force and the object of the revolution. Comrade Men He's heroic deeds have raised a very important question for us: Under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, as the revolution deepens, to make our thoughts adapt to the new revolutionary situation, we must constantly study Chairman Mao's entire set of theories, lines, policies, and principles on continuing the revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship. We must persist in criticizing and repudiating revisionism and fighting against selfishness, constantly raising our consciousness of class struggle and struggle between lines. Only in this way can we keep up with Chairman Mao and, like Comrade Men He, "always stand guard, keep watch, and fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line."

At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, I once fell behind the new situation. Later, after studying Chairman Mao's series of instructions, I came to realize that under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, the main target of the revolution is the representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the organs of proletarian dictatorship, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. Our struggle with them is a life-and-death class struggle, a serious struggle between restoration and anti-restoration, a top-priority issue concerning whether China will change color or not. After realizing this, I actively joined the struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders in the original local and county Party committees.

At this time, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party regarded me as a thorn in their eye and a bone in their throat. They rallied the untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, distorted right and wrong, spread rumors, and deceived some of the masses who did not understand the true situation, launching attacks and struggles against me. At this time, because I understood the theory of continuing the revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship and recognized the counter-revolutionary nature of the handful of capitalist-roaders, the more ferocious they appeared, the greater my determination to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line became. Every day when we went to work in the fields, they forcibly separated me from the masses and did not allow me to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the masses. I would run to the windward side and loudly read Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the community members. When they dragged me to the county and commune for struggle sessions, I seized every opportunity to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the masses and to explain the principles of defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

In this intense and sharp class struggle, I deeply realized: To be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and to defend it to the death, one must dare to go against the wind and fight against the waves, rushing to the front line of struggle. Where there is difficulty, we charge forward; where there is danger, we fight.

Studying Comrade Men He's heroic deeds and linking them with my own struggle practice, I also deeply felt that while struggling against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, we must also struggle against the "self" in our minds. Public and private cannot "coexist peacefully." The more "self" there is, the less "public" there is. If we do not overthrow "self," when we encounter storms, we will hesitate and waver, even seeking refuge in a "safe harbor." Therefore, only by consciously criticizing and repudiating revisionism and fighting against selfishness can we cultivate a heart that is infinitely loving, believing, worshipping, and loyal to Chairman Mao, and be like Comrade Men He: "Always thinking of Chairman Mao, always following Chairman Mao, always for Chairman Mao."

Never forget class struggle, grasp the initiative in class struggle.

Chairman Mao profoundly pointed out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its led revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." The class enemy is always on the lookout for an opportunity to strike. If you do not strike them, they will strike you; if you relax, they will attack. Therefore, we must, like Comrade Men He, constantly and unremittingly use the class struggle viewpoint and class analysis method taught by Chairman Mao to study new problems in class struggle, understand and analyze the new trends of the class enemy, so as to grasp the initiative in class struggle. Otherwise, we will be at a loss in the complex class struggle and fall into a passive position.

In the first half of 1966, our brigade, after the "Four Clean-ups" movement, had a good situation in both revolution and production. If we had continued to grasp class struggle and unremittingly launched attacks on the class enemy, the situation would have been even better. However, we relaxed in this regard, so at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, we gave the class enemy the opportunity to counterattack. The untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists colluded with the bad elements exposed during the "Four Clean-ups," distorted right and wrong, confused black and white, deceived some of the masses who did not understand the true situation, and launched attacks on the revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses. Later, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses launched a counterattack against the class enemy, turning the situation around.

After that, we had two more confrontations with the class enemy. Through these three attacks on the class enemy, a large amount of shocking material made the cadres and masses see the sharpness and complexity of class struggle and received profound education. In this way, the class enemy became a trapped animal, and the initiative was completely in our hands.

Believe in the masses, rely on the masses to resolutely defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Chairman Mao recently instructed: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship."

Comrade Men He is a vanguard fighter who leads the revolutionary masses in fighting against the class enemy. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, resolutely supported the revolutionary leftists, and bravely sacrificed himself for defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and protecting the comrades of the proletarian revolutionary faction. Comrade Men He's heroic deeds made me further realize that only by remembering Chairman Mao's teaching can we organize a vast revolutionary army to deal with a handful of class enemies.

The deeper the proletarian feelings for the revolutionary masses, the closer the follow to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

A handful of unrepentant capitalist-roaders and class enemies, during the Cultural Revolution, deceived some of the masses who did not understand the true situation and launched attacks and struggles against me. I always remembered Chairman Mao's teaching to believe in the masses and rely on the masses, and I always joined the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to direct the struggle spearhead at a handful of class enemies and did not fall for the class enemy's tricks. Later, I also followed Chairman Mao's teaching and did political and ideological work for the deceived masses. Some comrades saw me going to do ideological work for a few people three or five times and said to me: "You are still trying to persuade these few people, you have forgotten the ferocity with which they followed the class enemy to struggle against you!" I persuaded and educated these comrades: The struggle between the two lines is not about personal "grievances" and we cannot "keep accounts" with the deceived masses; as long as they are comrades who want revolution, we must unite with them, otherwise we will deviate from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In this way, through patient political and ideological work, those deceived masses awakened and turned against the class enemy, quickly exposing the class enemy in broad daylight.

From the struggle practice, I felt that as a revolutionary cadre, one cannot just be a fighter but must also be a commander who can lead the broad masses to struggle against the class enemy. To be a good commander, one must maintain close contact with the masses, humbly learn from the masses, work and study with the masses.

In the future, I will definitely, in the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, on the front line of class struggle, with Comrade Men He as an example, with the help of the poor and lower-middle peasants, constantly find gaps and problems, and learn from Comrade Men He with my own gaps and problems. I will learn from the heroes, see the actions, and be like Comrade Men He: Always remember class struggle, always remember proletarian dictatorship, always emphasize politics, always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and launch even more fierce attacks on Liu Shaoqi and all class enemies, attack again and again, and carry out the political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes to the end!

    坚决捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线
    河北省革命委员会委员  临西县东留善固大队党支部书记  吕玉兰
    门合同志的英雄事迹，使我受到很大教育和鼓舞。门合同志不愧是捍卫毛主席革命路线奋斗终生的英雄，是无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部，是我们学习的光辉榜样。
    只有同时进行“两个革命”，才能捍卫毛主席的革命路线
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。门合同志把活学活用毛主席著作当做生命的第一需要。他既做革命的动力，又做革命的对象。门合同志的光辉事迹给我们提出了一个极其重要的问题：在无产阶级专政条件下，革命越来越深入，要使自己的思想与革命新形势相适应，就得不断学习毛主席关于无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的一整套理论、路线、方针和政策，坚持斗私批修，不断提高阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟。只有这样，才能紧跟毛主席，才能象门合同志那样：“时刻为毛主席的革命路线放好哨，站好岗，打好仗。”
    文化大革命初期，我曾一度跟不上新形势。后来，学习了毛主席的一系列指示，我才认识到，在无产阶级专政条件下，革命的主要对象是混入无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级的代表人物，是党内一小撮走资派。我们同他们的斗争是你死我活的阶级大搏斗，是复辟与反复辟的严重斗争，是关系到中国变不变颜色的头等大事。认识到这一点以后，我就积极向原地、县委内一小撮走资派进行斗争。
    这时，党内一小撮走资派，把我看成眼中钉，肉中刺，纠集没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，颠倒黑白，散布谣言，蒙蔽一部分不明真象的群众，对我进行了围攻和斗争。这时由于我懂得了在无产阶级专政条件下继续革命的道理，认清了一小撮走资派的反革命面目，所以他们越是凶相毕露，我捍卫毛主席革命路线的决心越大。每天下地劳动时，他们强行把我和群众分隔开，不让我向群众宣传毛主席的最新指示。我就跑到上风头，大声念毛主席的最新指示给社员群众听。他们把我拉到县、社斗争时，我找一切机会，向群众宣传毛主席的最新指示，宣传捍卫毛主席的革命路线的道理。
    在这种激烈尖锐的阶级斗争实践中，我深深认识到：要无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，要誓死捍卫毛主席的革命路线，就得敢于顶逆风，战恶浪，奔向斗争第一线，哪里困难，就冲向哪里；哪里危险，就战斗在哪里。
    学习门合同志的英雄事迹，联系自己的斗争实践，我还深深体会到，在对党内一小撮走资派进行斗争的同时，必须对自己头脑中的“私”字作斗争。公与私，不能“和平共处”。“私”字多一分，“公”字就少一分。如果不打倒“私”字，一遇风浪，就会出现犹豫动摇，甚至逃进“避风港”。所以，只有自觉地破私立公，对“私”字狠狠地斗，才能斗出一颗对毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的红心，才能够象门合同志那样：“一切想着毛主席，一切服从毛主席，一切紧跟毛主席，一切为着毛主席。”
    念念不忘阶级斗争，掌握阶级斗争的主动权
    毛主席极其深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”阶级敌人在经常窥测方向，以求一逞。你不打他，他就打你；你松一松，他就攻一攻。因此，我们只有象门合同志那样，经常不断地用毛主席教导我们的阶级斗争观点和阶级分析方法，研究阶级斗争中的新问题，了解和分析阶级敌人的新动向，才能掌握阶级斗争的主动权。不这样，我们就会在复杂的阶级斗争中晕头转向，处于被动。
    一九六六年上半年，我们队经过“四清”运动，革命和生产形势大好。如果我们继续狠抓阶级斗争，不断地向阶级敌人发动进攻，就会出现更好的形势。但是，我们放松了这方面的工作，所以在文化大革命初期，给了阶级敌人反扑的机会。没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，勾结“四清”中被揭发出来的坏人，颠倒是非，混淆黑白，蒙蔽一部分不明真象的群众，围攻革命派和革命干部。后来在解放军的帮助下，广大贫下中农和革命群众向阶级敌人进行了反击，才把局势扭转过来。
    随后，我们又同阶级敌人进行了两次较量。通过这三次向阶级敌人发动进攻，大量触目惊心的材料，使干部和群众看到了阶级斗争的尖锐性、复杂性，受到了深刻的教育。这样，阶级敌人成了瓮中之鳖，主动权完全掌握在我们手里。
    相信群众，依靠群众坚决捍卫毛主席革命路线
    毛主席最近指示说：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”
    门合同志是带领革命群众对阶级敌人进行战斗的先锋战士。他在无产阶级文化大革命中，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决支持革命左派，为捍卫毛主席的革命路线，为保卫无产阶级革命派战友而英勇献身。门合同志的光辉事迹，使我进一步认识到，只有牢记毛主席的这一教导，才能组织起浩浩荡荡的革命大军，去对付一小撮阶级敌人。
    对革命群众的无产阶级感情越深，跟毛主席的革命路线就越紧。
    一小撮死不悔改的走资派和阶级敌人，在文化大革命中，蒙蔽一部分不明真象的群众，对我进行围攻和斗争时，我牢记毛主席相信群众，依靠群众这一教导，始终同广大贫下中农一起，把斗争的矛头指向一小撮阶级敌人，没有上阶级敌人的当。后来，我又遵照毛主席的这一教导，对受蒙蔽的群众做政治思想工作。有的同志见我三番五次地去做几个人的思想工作，便对我说：“你还说服这几个人哩，你就忘了他们跟着阶级敌人斗争你的那个狠劲了！”我对这些同志进行了说服教育：两条路线斗争，不是什么个人“恩怨”，不能给受蒙蔽的群众“记账”；只要是要革命的同志，就必须团结过来，不这样就会背离毛主席的革命路线。这样，经过耐心的思想政治工作，那些受蒙蔽的群众醒悟了，纷纷反戈一击，使阶级敌人很快暴露在光天化日之下。
    我从斗争的实践中体会到，做一个革命干部，不能仅仅是一个战斗员，还必须是能够带领广大群众向阶级敌人进行斗争的指挥员。而要当好指挥员，就必须和群众保持密切联系，虚心向群众学习，和群众劳动在一起，学习在一起。
    今后我一定在活学活用毛主席著作中，在阶级斗争的第一线上，以英雄门合为榜样，在贫下中农的帮助下，不断地找差距、找问题，做到带着自己的差距学门合，带着自己的问题学门合。做到学英雄，看行动，象英雄门合同志那样：念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，更加猛烈地向中国赫鲁晓夫和一切阶级敌人进攻，再进攻，把无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命进行到底！
