The Ceylon Communist Party held its ninth congress in April.

The Ceylon Communist Party's "Red Flag" weekly recently published the news bulletin of this congress and the international section of the political report of the Central Committee unanimously adopted by the congress.

The two documents pointed out that the general crisis of capitalism is deepening, and the modern revisionist groups centered around the Soviet revisionist traitors are disintegrating. The documents enthusiastically praised Mao Zedong Thought and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, reiterating the application of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to the revolutionary practice in Ceylon. The documents criticized some anti-Marxist-Leninist and anti-Mao Zedong Thought views on guerrilla warfare and revolution. The documents discussed the domestic situation in Ceylon and proposed the revolutionary tasks of the Ceylon Communist Party. The congress also adopted the seven-point program for the current struggle of the Ceylon Communist Party.

In discussing the international situation, the documents pointed out that the revolutionary situation in the world is excellent. The general crisis of world imperialism is deepening, and the heroic resistance of the Vietnamese people has exacerbated the economic crisis in the United States. The contradictions within imperialism are becoming more acute. The documents listed the failure of U.S. imperialism in Vietnam, the rebellion of blacks in the United States, the devaluation of the pound, the threat of dollar devaluation, the decision of British imperialism to withdraw from East of Suez, and the deepening contradictions within imperialism, to show that the general crisis of world imperialism is continuously deepening.

The documents said that these manifestations of the deepening crisis of world imperialism prove the correctness of the Marxist-Leninist view that we are living in an era when world imperialism is heading towards total collapse.

The documents pointed out that since the eighth congress held in July 1965, the invincible truth of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought has been greatly developed throughout the world. The vigorous development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is one of the greatest events of our time, and its influence is even greater than the October Revolution.

The documents said that the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong, has brilliantly pointed out the path of such a revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Based on the experience of the Russian and Chinese revolutions, he clearly stated that class and class struggle continue to exist after the socialist revolution, even after the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The documents said that this revolution not only exposed the hidden enemies of the party and the state, especially the handful of power-holders within the party who were trying to implement the capitalist reactionary line and oppose Comrade Mao Zedong's revolutionary line, but also prevented the restoration of capitalism in China, ensuring that China continues to be a base for world revolution, thus guaranteeing the early victory of the world revolution.

The documents said that in the process of personally leading the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong creatively developed Marxism-Leninism in guiding the world revolutionary movement to fight against imperialism, reactionaries, and modern revisionists, and raised it to a new stage, which is what we now call the new stage of Mao Zedong Thought. The documents said that we wholeheartedly agree with the assessment made in the communiqu√© of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China: "Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Comrade Mao Zedong has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new stage. Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards total collapse and socialism is heading towards world victory."

The documents said that we agree with the analysis made by the Chinese comrades on Comrade Mao Zedong's contributions to the development of Marxism-Leninism: "Marx and Engels founded the theory of scientific socialism, Lenin and Stalin developed Marxism and solved a series of problems of proletarian revolution in the era of imperialism, and solved the theoretical and practical problems of establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat in one country. Comrade Mao Zedong developed Marxism-Leninism and solved a series of problems of proletarian revolution in the contemporary era, and solved the theoretical and practical problems of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing the restoration of capitalism. These are three great milestones in the history of the development of Marxism."

The documents said that in Lenin's time, anyone who attacked Leninism was fundamentally attacking Marxism. Similarly, today, anyone who attacks Mao Zedong Thought is fundamentally attacking Marxism-Leninism. Not long after the October Revolution, Lenin said that to test whether a person is a socialist, one should look at his attitude towards the Soviet Union. Today, to test whether a person is a socialist, one should look at his attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought and the People's Republic of China.

The documents said that it is the duty of every party member and every Marxist-Leninist to consciously study Mao Zedong Thought, to spread it widely among all strata of people in our country, and to apply it in practice according to the specific conditions of the Ceylon revolution.

The documents pointed out that the Communist Party of China and the Party of Labour of Albania are two brilliant examples of Marxist-Leninist parties that we should learn from. Their practices in building revolutionary parties, adhering to the teachings of Marxism-Leninism, carrying out revolutions, establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat, and then defending the dictatorship of the proletariat against the attacks of imperialism, modern revisionism, and various reactionaries, and preventing the restoration of capitalism, and their practices of continuing to advance the revolution at home, are all examples for all Marxist-Leninist parties. We must humbly study their experiences and learn from them.

The documents strongly condemned Soviet modern revisionism. It said that modern revisionism centered around the Soviet Union has been continuously exposed. The development of things fully proves the analysis of Marxist-Leninists that modern revisionism is nothing but the bourgeois forces within the workers' movement, the last force mobilized by world imperialism in its dying moments. Today, it is playing the role of a support for the wobbly and decaying tree of world imperialism.

The documents pointed out that the Soviet modern revisionist ruling clique is gradually restoring capitalism and abolishing the dictatorship of the proletariat in the first workers' state; they openly collude with the number one enemy of the people of the world, U.S. imperialism, in all diplomatic matters; they have betrayed all national liberation struggles; they have run errands for U.S. imperialism in the Vietnam issue; in the recent aggression by U.S.-supported Israel against the Arab people, they have betrayed the Arab people; they provide weapons and other aid to the reactionary Indian government to promote the anti-China movement in India; they are friendly with the bloody reactionary regime in Indonesia and provide aid to it; they participate in the global strategy of U.S. imperialism to encircle China with military bases; they shamelessly participate in the anti-China chorus of slandering the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of the Chinese proletariat together with the most reactionary groups in the world. All this is more than enough to convince even those who have sincere doubts about the reactionary and pro-imperialist role of the modern revisionists (whose leadership center is in the Soviet Union).

The documents pointed out that modern revisionism is facing its final crisis. All attempts by the Soviet revisionist clique to convene an illegal world communist party conference have miserably failed. All this is a sign of disintegration within the modern revisionist camp, heralding its final and inevitable failure.

The documents said that it is necessary to reaffirm our firm belief: there can be no compromise, no middle ground, and no bridge between Marxism-Leninism and modern revisionism. There is no room for compromise. Some parties and individuals mistakenly think that they can take a "neutral" stance between Marxism-Leninism and modern revisionism. Declaring "neutrality" in this great struggle is only the first step towards modern revisionism. There is no third way.

The documents pointed out that due to the recognition that the majority of the international revolutionary movement have seen through the erroneous position of modern revisionism centered around the CPSU, and the recognition that modern revisionism can no longer deceive the people as it did before, they have forced some so-called "neutral" forces to serve them. These forces use Marxist-Leninist vocabulary to decorate themselves, but in fact, they have become tools for spreading modern revisionist and anti-Marxist thoughts and have become opponents of Mao Zedong Thought.

The documents also criticized some petty-bourgeois anti-Marxist-Leninist and anti-Mao Zedong Thought views on guerrilla warfare and revolution. The documents pointed out that due to the recognition that Mao Zedong's thoughts on protracted people's war and the establishment of revolutionary bases in the countryside are increasingly accepted by the people, especially the youth, it seems that someone is concentrating on spreading some people's fundamentally anti-Marxist views on guerrilla warfare to oppose Mao Zedong Thought.

The documents pointed out that someone is trying to propagate the point of view that regardless of whether the people are prepared for revolution, a determined group of revolutionaries can overthrow the existing state machine, seize power, and then attract the people to their side.

The documents said that this theory is fundamentally based on romantic and petty-bourgeois ideas, characterized by denying the necessity of the leadership of the Communist Party and not believing in the masses. It relies not on the masses but mainly on a few boastful figures like the Three Musketeers, hoping that they can perform miracles in extremely unfavorable conditions.

The documents pointed out that this is completely different from Comrade Mao Zedong's theory of people's war, which is based on fully relying on the masses. It requires revolutionaries to go among the masses, especially to work among the peasants, to blend with the peasants, to establish rural revolutionary bases, to wage protracted people's war, and finally to surround the cities with the countryside and liberate the cities.

The documents said that Comrade Mao Zedong clearly stated: "Revolutionary war is a war of the masses; only by mobilizing the masses can we wage war, and only by relying on the masses can we wage war." Therefore, the basis of the Marxist-Leninist theory of people's war is to mobilize the masses under the leadership of the proletarian party for revolution, with the aim of seizing power.

The documents said that all Marxist-Leninists must always be vigilant in their thinking and must be able to distinguish between genuine and fake goods that modern revisionists attempt to pass off as genuine.

The documents said that the congress must reaffirm our absolute loyalty to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. We must arm all our party members with this most advanced theory of the contemporary era, help them learn it, and apply it to the specific situation of the Ceylon revolution.

In discussing the domestic situation, the documents pointed out that the United National Party has mortgaged the economy of Ceylon to foreign imperialism, worsening the economic crisis. The people's dissatisfaction and anger with the government led by the United National Party have greatly increased. The documents also condemned the Lanka Sama Samaja Party and the Knieman revisionist clique for implementing a policy of class collaboration, which has become a traitor to the working class and the progressive movement.

In discussing the revolutionary tasks of the Ceylon Communist Party, the documents pointed out: One of the basic tasks facing the party is to thoroughly dispel the illusions of bourgeois parliamentary democracy among the people, to educate them to understand that the parliamentary road is impassable, to make them believe that the parliament is only a decoration, and that the bourgeoisie uses it as a weapon to deceive the people and divert their attention from the true source of power‚Äîthe armed forces. The party must educate the people that only by violently overthrowing the oppressive imperialist-bourgeois state machine can the working class and its allies have the hope of seizing power.

The documents pointed out that in order to achieve this goal, the party must, as Comrade Mao Zedong has taught, become a disciplined party armed with Marxist-Leninist theory, using the weapon of self-criticism, and closely linked with the masses.

The documents pointed out that the party must also achieve a united front of all revolutionary forces, including workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and all other patriotic and progressive forces. The worker-peasant alliance must be the basis of this united front, and the working class itself must lead this united front. The fundamental issue of the united front is whether the party can achieve unity between workers and peasants. Only on the basis of achieving this alliance can unity with other progressive forces be achieved.

The documents called on the whole party not to limit party activities to cities but to go to the countryside, to mobilize peasants and plantation workers with the revolutionary future, and to do good mass work with the correct style. The report warned against continuing to do trade union work and other mass work in a reformist manner and emphasized that all mass work should aim at the final seizure of power by the working class.

The congress adopted the seven-point program for the current struggle, including: freeing Ceylon from the rule of British and American imperialism and achieving true independence for Ceylon; eliminating feudalism and establishing true people's democracy; establishing an independent national economy free from imperialist control and self-reliance; establishing unity among the various nationalities of Ceylon against imperialism and feudalism; resolutely opposing all imperialism, especially the number one enemy of the world, U.S. imperialism, and resolutely supporting all national liberation movements against imperialism.

At the newly elected Central Committee meeting after the congress, Comrade Samugadasan was elected as the General Secretary.
