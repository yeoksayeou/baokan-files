The Ceylon Communist Party held its ninth congress in April.

The Ceylon Communist Party's "Red Flag" weekly recently published the news bulletin of this congress and the international section of the political report of the Central Committee unanimously adopted by the congress.

The two documents pointed out that the general crisis of capitalism is deepening, and the modern revisionist groups centered around the Soviet revisionist traitors are disintegrating. The documents enthusiastically praised Mao Zedong Thought and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, reiterating the application of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to the revolutionary practice in Ceylon. The documents criticized some anti-Marxist-Leninist and anti-Mao Zedong Thought views on guerrilla warfare and revolution. The documents discussed the domestic situation in Ceylon and proposed the revolutionary tasks of the Ceylon Communist Party. The congress also adopted the seven-point program for the current struggle of the Ceylon Communist Party.

In discussing the international situation, the documents pointed out that the revolutionary situation in the world is excellent. The general crisis of world imperialism is deepening, and the heroic resistance of the Vietnamese people has exacerbated the economic crisis in the United States. The contradictions within imperialism are becoming more acute. The documents listed the failure of U.S. imperialism in Vietnam, the rebellion of blacks in the United States, the devaluation of the pound, the threat of dollar devaluation, the decision of British imperialism to withdraw from East of Suez, and the deepening contradictions within imperialism, to show that the general crisis of world imperialism is continuously deepening.

The documents said that these manifestations of the deepening crisis of world imperialism prove the correctness of the Marxist-Leninist view that we are living in an era when world imperialism is heading towards total collapse.

The documents pointed out that since the eighth congress held in July 1965, the invincible truth of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought has been greatly developed throughout the world. The vigorous development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is one of the greatest events of our time, and its influence is even greater than the October Revolution.

The documents said that the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong, has brilliantly pointed out the path of such a revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Based on the experience of the Russian and Chinese revolutions, he clearly stated that class and class struggle continue to exist after the socialist revolution, even after the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The documents said that this revolution not only exposed the hidden enemies of the party and the state, especially the handful of power-holders within the party who were trying to implement the capitalist reactionary line and oppose Comrade Mao Zedong's revolutionary line, but also prevented the restoration of capitalism in China, ensuring that China continues to be a base for world revolution, thus guaranteeing the early victory of the world revolution.

The documents said that in the process of personally leading the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong creatively developed Marxism-Leninism in guiding the world revolutionary movement to fight against imperialism, reactionaries, and modern revisionists, and raised it to a new stage, which is what we now call the new stage of Mao Zedong Thought. The documents said that we wholeheartedly agree with the assessment made in the communiqué of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China: "Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Comrade Mao Zedong has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new stage. Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards total collapse and socialism is heading towards world victory."

The documents said that we agree with the analysis made by the Chinese comrades on Comrade Mao Zedong's contributions to the development of Marxism-Leninism: "Marx and Engels founded the theory of scientific socialism, Lenin and Stalin developed Marxism and solved a series of problems of proletarian revolution in the era of imperialism, and solved the theoretical and practical problems of establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat in one country. Comrade Mao Zedong developed Marxism-Leninism and solved a series of problems of proletarian revolution in the contemporary era, and solved the theoretical and practical problems of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing the restoration of capitalism. These are three great milestones in the history of the development of Marxism."

The documents said that in Lenin's time, anyone who attacked Leninism was fundamentally attacking Marxism. Similarly, today, anyone who attacks Mao Zedong Thought is fundamentally attacking Marxism-Leninism. Not long after the October Revolution, Lenin said that to test whether a person is a socialist, one should look at his attitude towards the Soviet Union. Today, to test whether a person is a socialist, one should look at his attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought and the People's Republic of China.

The documents said that it is the duty of every party member and every Marxist-Leninist to consciously study Mao Zedong Thought, to spread it widely among all strata of people in our country, and to apply it in practice according to the specific conditions of the Ceylon revolution.

The documents pointed out that the Communist Party of China and the Party of Labour of Albania are two brilliant examples of Marxist-Leninist parties that we should learn from. Their practices in building revolutionary parties, adhering to the teachings of Marxism-Leninism, carrying out revolutions, establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat, and then defending the dictatorship of the proletariat against the attacks of imperialism, modern revisionism, and various reactionaries, and preventing the restoration of capitalism, and their practices of continuing to advance the revolution at home, are all examples for all Marxist-Leninist parties. We must humbly study their experiences and learn from them.

The documents strongly condemned Soviet modern revisionism. It said that modern revisionism centered around the Soviet Union has been continuously exposed. The development of things fully proves the analysis of Marxist-Leninists that modern revisionism is nothing but the bourgeois forces within the workers' movement, the last force mobilized by world imperialism in its dying moments. Today, it is playing the role of a support for the wobbly and decaying tree of world imperialism.

The documents pointed out that the Soviet modern revisionist ruling clique is gradually restoring capitalism and abolishing the dictatorship of the proletariat in the first workers' state; they openly collude with the number one enemy of the people of the world, U.S. imperialism, in all diplomatic matters; they have betrayed all national liberation struggles; they have run errands for U.S. imperialism in the Vietnam issue; in the recent aggression by U.S.-supported Israel against the Arab people, they have betrayed the Arab people; they provide weapons and other aid to the reactionary Indian government to promote the anti-China movement in India; they are friendly with the bloody reactionary regime in Indonesia and provide aid to it; they participate in the global strategy of U.S. imperialism to encircle China with military bases; they shamelessly participate in the anti-China chorus of slandering the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of the Chinese proletariat together with the most reactionary groups in the world. All this is more than enough to convince even those who have sincere doubts about the reactionary and pro-imperialist role of the modern revisionists (whose leadership center is in the Soviet Union).

The documents pointed out that modern revisionism is facing its final crisis. All attempts by the Soviet revisionist clique to convene an illegal world communist party conference have miserably failed. All this is a sign of disintegration within the modern revisionist camp, heralding its final and inevitable failure.

The documents said that it is necessary to reaffirm our firm belief: there can be no compromise, no middle ground, and no bridge between Marxism-Leninism and modern revisionism. There is no room for compromise. Some parties and individuals mistakenly think that they can take a "neutral" stance between Marxism-Leninism and modern revisionism. Declaring "neutrality" in this great struggle is only the first step towards modern revisionism. There is no third way.

The documents pointed out that due to the recognition that the majority of the international revolutionary movement have seen through the erroneous position of modern revisionism centered around the CPSU, and the recognition that modern revisionism can no longer deceive the people as it did before, they have forced some so-called "neutral" forces to serve them. These forces use Marxist-Leninist vocabulary to decorate themselves, but in fact, they have become tools for spreading modern revisionist and anti-Marxist thoughts and have become opponents of Mao Zedong Thought.

The documents also criticized some petty-bourgeois anti-Marxist-Leninist and anti-Mao Zedong Thought views on guerrilla warfare and revolution. The documents pointed out that due to the recognition that Mao Zedong's thoughts on protracted people's war and the establishment of revolutionary bases in the countryside are increasingly accepted by the people, especially the youth, it seems that someone is concentrating on spreading some people's fundamentally anti-Marxist views on guerrilla warfare to oppose Mao Zedong Thought.

The documents pointed out that someone is trying to propagate the point of view that regardless of whether the people are prepared for revolution, a determined group of revolutionaries can overthrow the existing state machine, seize power, and then attract the people to their side.

The documents said that this theory is fundamentally based on romantic and petty-bourgeois ideas, characterized by denying the necessity of the leadership of the Communist Party and not believing in the masses. It relies not on the masses but mainly on a few boastful figures like the Three Musketeers, hoping that they can perform miracles in extremely unfavorable conditions.

The documents pointed out that this is completely different from Comrade Mao Zedong's theory of people's war, which is based on fully relying on the masses. It requires revolutionaries to go among the masses, especially to work among the peasants, to blend with the peasants, to establish rural revolutionary bases, to wage protracted people's war, and finally to surround the cities with the countryside and liberate the cities.

The documents said that Comrade Mao Zedong clearly stated: "Revolutionary war is a war of the masses; only by mobilizing the masses can we wage war, and only by relying on the masses can we wage war." Therefore, the basis of the Marxist-Leninist theory of people's war is to mobilize the masses under the leadership of the proletarian party for revolution, with the aim of seizing power.

The documents said that all Marxist-Leninists must always be vigilant in their thinking and must be able to distinguish between genuine and fake goods that modern revisionists attempt to pass off as genuine.

The documents said that the congress must reaffirm our absolute loyalty to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. We must arm all our party members with this most advanced theory of the contemporary era, help them learn it, and apply it to the specific situation of the Ceylon revolution.

In discussing the domestic situation, the documents pointed out that the United National Party has mortgaged the economy of Ceylon to foreign imperialism, worsening the economic crisis. The people's dissatisfaction and anger with the government led by the United National Party have greatly increased. The documents also condemned the Lanka Sama Samaja Party and the Knieman revisionist clique for implementing a policy of class collaboration, which has become a traitor to the working class and the progressive movement.

In discussing the revolutionary tasks of the Ceylon Communist Party, the documents pointed out: One of the basic tasks facing the party is to thoroughly dispel the illusions of bourgeois parliamentary democracy among the people, to educate them to understand that the parliamentary road is impassable, to make them believe that the parliament is only a decoration, and that the bourgeoisie uses it as a weapon to deceive the people and divert their attention from the true source of power—the armed forces. The party must educate the people that only by violently overthrowing the oppressive imperialist-bourgeois state machine can the working class and its allies have the hope of seizing power.

The documents pointed out that in order to achieve this goal, the party must, as Comrade Mao Zedong has taught, become a disciplined party armed with Marxist-Leninist theory, using the weapon of self-criticism, and closely linked with the masses.

The documents pointed out that the party must also achieve a united front of all revolutionary forces, including workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and all other patriotic and progressive forces. The worker-peasant alliance must be the basis of this united front, and the working class itself must lead this united front. The fundamental issue of the united front is whether the party can achieve unity between workers and peasants. Only on the basis of achieving this alliance can unity with other progressive forces be achieved.

The documents called on the whole party not to limit party activities to cities but to go to the countryside, to mobilize peasants and plantation workers with the revolutionary future, and to do good mass work with the correct style. The report warned against continuing to do trade union work and other mass work in a reformist manner and emphasized that all mass work should aim at the final seizure of power by the working class.

The congress adopted the seven-point program for the current struggle, including: freeing Ceylon from the rule of British and American imperialism and achieving true independence for Ceylon; eliminating feudalism and establishing true people's democracy; establishing an independent national economy free from imperialist control and self-reliance; establishing unity among the various nationalities of Ceylon against imperialism and feudalism; resolutely opposing all imperialism, especially the number one enemy of the world, U.S. imperialism, and resolutely supporting all national liberation movements against imperialism.

At the newly elected Central Committee meeting after the congress, Comrade Samugadasan was elected as the General Secretary.

    锡兰共产党召开第九次代表大会
    热情歌颂毛泽东思想和中国无产阶级文化大革命，重申把马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想运用到锡兰的革命实践
    强烈谴责苏联现代修正主义，指出现代修正主义是工人阶级运动内部的资产阶级势力，现代修正主义面临着最后的危机桑穆加塔桑同志当选为总书记　代表大会通过目前斗争的七点纲领
    新华社科伦坡十四日电　锡兰共产党在四月间召开了第九次代表大会。
    锡兰共产党的《红旗》周刊最近刊登了这次大会的新闻公报和代表大会所一致通过的中央委员会的政治报告的国际问题部分。
    两个文件指出了资本主义总危机日益加深，苏修叛徒集团等现代修正主义集团分崩离析。文件热情地歌颂毛泽东思想和中国无产阶级文化大革命，重申把马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想运用到锡兰的革命实践。文件批判了一些关于游击战和革命问题上的反马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的观点。文件谈到了锡兰国内形势，提出了锡兰共产党的革命任务。代表大会还通过了锡兰共产党的目前斗争的七点纲领。
    文件在谈到国际形势时指出，世界革命形势大好。世界帝国主义总危机日益加深，越南人民的英勇抵抗加剧了美国国内的经济危机。帝国主义内部的矛盾发展得更加剧烈。文件列举美帝国主义在越南的失败、美国国内黑人的反抗、英镑的贬值、美元贬值的威胁、英帝国主义撤出苏伊士以东的决定、帝国主义内部矛盾日益加深等事实，说明世界帝国主义总危机在不断地加剧。
    文件说，世界帝国主义危机加剧的这些表现，证明了马克思列宁主义者的论断，即我们生活在世界帝国主义走向全面崩溃的时代。
    文件指出，自一九六五年七月召开的第八次代表大会以来，战无不胜的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的真理在全世界得到了巨大的发展。中国无产阶级文化大革命的蓬勃发展，是我们时代最伟大的事件之一，它的影响比十月革命还要深远。
    文件说，中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志天才地指出了在无产阶级专政条件下进行这样一场革命的道路。他根据俄国革命和中国革命的经验，明确了阶级和阶级斗争在社会主义革命后，甚至在无产阶级专政建立以后，仍然继续存在。
    文件说，这场革命不仅揪出了隐藏着的党和国家的敌人，特别是企图推行资产阶级反动路线、对抗毛泽东同志革命路线的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，而且防止了资本主义在中国复辟，使中国继续作为世界革命的基地，从而保证了世界革命的早日胜利。
    文件说，毛泽东同志在亲自领导无产阶级文化大革命的过程中，在指导世界革命运动反对帝国主义和反动派以及现代修正主义分子的斗争中创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，并把它提高到一个崭新阶段，也就是我们现在所说的毛泽东思想新阶段。文件说，我们衷心赞同中国共产党八届十一中全会公报所做的如下估价：“毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛泽东同志天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。”
    文件说，我们赞同中国同志关于毛泽东同志对发展马克思列宁主义的贡献所做的如下分析：“马克思和恩格斯创立了科学社会主义的理论，列宁和斯大林发展了马克思主义，解决了帝国主义时代无产阶级革命的一系列的问题，解决了在一个国家内实现无产阶级专政的理论和实践问题，毛泽东同志发展了马克思列宁主义，解决了当代无产阶级革命的一系列的问题，解决了在无产阶级专政下进行革命、防止资本主义复辟的理论和实践问题。这是马克思主义发展史上三个伟大的里程碑。”
    文件说，在列宁的时代，谁攻击列宁主义，谁就是从根本上攻击马克思主义。同样地，在今天，谁攻击毛泽东思想，谁也就是从根本上攻击马克思列宁主义。十月革命后不久，列宁说过，检验一个人是不是一个社会主义者，就看他对待苏联的态度。在今天看一个人是不是一个社会主义者，就看他对待毛泽东思想的态度、对待人民中国的态度。
    文件说，自觉地学习毛泽东思想，在我国各阶层人民中间最广泛地传播毛泽东思想，并根据锡兰革命形势的具体条件在实践中运用毛泽东思想，是我党每一个党员的义务，也是每一个马克思列宁主义者的义务。
    文件指出，中国共产党和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党是值得我们仿效的马克思列宁主义党的两个光辉榜样。他们在建设革命党，坚持马克思列宁主义学说，进行革命，建立无产阶级专政，然后又在帝国主义、现代修正主义及形形色色的反动派的进攻面前保卫无产阶级专政，并且防止资本主义复辟，保卫无产阶级专政方面的做法，他们在国内继续把革命推向前进的做法，都是所有马克思列宁主义党的榜样。我们必须虚心地研究他们的经验，向他们学习。
    文件强烈谴责苏联现代修正主义。它说，以苏联为中心的现代修正主义不断地被揭露。事物的发展完全证明了马克思列宁主义者的分析，现代修正主义不是别的，而是工人阶级运动内部的资产阶级势力，是世界帝国主义在其灭亡的时刻从工人阶级内部调动的最后一股力量。它今天起着世界帝国主义这株摇摇欲坠的枯树的支架的作用。
    文件指出，苏联现代修正主义统治集团在苏联国内逐步复辟资本主义和取消第一个工人国家里的无产阶级专政；他们在一切外交事务方面与全世界人民的头号敌人美帝国主义公开勾结；他们出卖了所有的民族解放斗争；他们在越南问题上为美帝国主义跑腿；在最近美国支持的以色列对阿拉伯人民进行的侵略中背叛了阿拉伯人民；他们向反动的印度政府提供武器和其它援助以推进印度的反华运动；他们与印尼的血腥的反动政权友好并向它提供援助；他们参加美帝国主义用军事基地包围中国的这种全球战略；他们与世界上最反动的集团一起，无耻地参加了诬蔑中国无产阶级文化大革命的反华大合唱。所有这一切，已绰绰有余地甚至使那些对现代修正主义者（他们的领导中心在苏联）所起的反动的、亲帝国主义的作用抱诚实的怀疑态度的人信服了。
    文件指出，现代修正主义面临着最后的危机。苏联修正主义集团为了召开一次非法的世界共产党会议所作的一切尝试都可悲地失败了。所有这一切都是现代修正主义阵营内部分崩离析的迹象，预示了它的最后的和不可避免的失败命运。
    文件说，有必要重申我们的坚定信念：在马克思列宁主义和现代修正主义之间，不可能妥协，不可能折衷，也不可能搭桥，没有调和的余地。有一些党派和人们妄想在马克思列宁主义和现代修正主义之间采取“中立”的立场。宣布在这场巨大的斗争中保持“中立”只是沿着现代修正主义的道路前进的第一步。第三条道路是没有的。
    文件指出，由于认识到国际革命运动队伍中的大多数人看穿了以苏共为中心的现代修正主义的错误立场，认识到现代修正主义已不再能象以前那样欺骗人民，他们已迫使某些所谓“中立”力量为他们服务。这些力量用马克思列宁主义的词汇来装饰自己，但是事实上已成为散布现代修正主义思想和反马克思主义思想的工具，成为毛泽东思想的反对者。
    文件还批判了一些关于游击战和革命问题上的反马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的小资产阶级的观点。文件指出，由于认识到毛泽东关于持久的人民战争和在农村建立革命根据地的思想正在日益为人民特别是青年所接受，看来有人正在集中地企图散布某些人关于游击战的根本反马克思主义的观点，以反对毛泽东思想。
    文件指出，有人正在企图宣传这种论点：不管人民是否准备进行革命，一伙坚决的革命者就能够推翻现有的国家机器，夺取政权，并在以后把人民吸引到他们这一边来。
    文件说，这种理论在根本上是以浪漫主义的和小资产阶级的思想为基础的，这种思想的特点是否定共产党领导的必要性，不相信群众。它依靠的不是群众，而主要依靠一伙虚张声势的三剑客式的浮夸人物，期望他们在极其不利的情况下作出奇迹。
    文件指出，这与毛泽东同志的人民战争学说毫无共同之处，这个学说是以完全依靠群众为基础的，它要革命者到群众当中进行工作，特别是对农民进行工作，与农民打成一片，建立农村革命根据地，进行持久的人民战争，最后用农村包围城市并解放城市。
    文件说，毛泽东同志明确地说：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”因此，马克思列宁主义的人民战争学说的基础是在工人阶级政党的领导下对群众进行革命动员，目的在于夺取政权。
    文件说，所有的马克思列宁主义者必须始终在思想上保持警惕，必须能够区分真货与新修正主义者企图鱼目混珠的假货。
    文件说，代表大会必须重申我们绝对地忠于马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。我们必须用当代的这个最先进的学说武装我们的全体党员，帮助他们学习它，把它应用到锡兰革命形势的具体情况中去。
    文件谈到国内形势时指出，统一国民党，把锡兰的经济抵押给外国帝国主义，使经济危机恶化了。人民对统一国民党领导的政府的不满和愤怒大大增长了。文件还谴责平等社会党和克尼曼修正主义集团实行阶级合作政策，已成为工人阶级和进步运动的叛徒。
    文件在谈到锡共的革命任务时指出：放在党面前的基本任务之一是，大破人民中间对资产阶级议会民主的幻想，教育他们懂得议会道路行不通，使他们相信，议会只是一种装饰品，资产阶级用它作为武器来欺骗人民，转移他们对真正的权力所在——武装力量——的注意。党必须教育人民，只有用暴力推翻镇压性的帝国主义——资产阶级国家机器，工人阶级及其同盟者才有希望取得政权。
    文件指出，为了实现这个目的，党必须象毛泽东同志所教导的，成为一个有纪律的，有马克思列宁主义的理论武装的，运用自我批评武器的，密切联系群众的党。
    文件指出，党也必须实现一个包括工人、农民、革命知识分子和其他一切爱国和进步力量的一切的革命力量统一战线。工农联盟必须成为这个统一战线的基础，而工人阶级自己必须领导这个统一战线。统一战线的根本问题是，党能不能实现工农团结。只有在实现这个联盟的基础上，才能实现同其他进步力量的团结。
    文件号召全党不要把党的活动仅仅限于城市，而要走向农村，用革命的前途来动员农民和种植园工人，用正确的作风作好群众工作。报告告诫不要继续用改良主义的方式来作工会工作和其他群众工作，并强调指出，一切群众工作应该以工人阶级最后夺取政权为目标。
    代表大会通过了目前斗争的七点纲领，内容包括：使锡兰摆脱英美帝国主义的统治，实现锡兰的真正独立；消灭封建主义，建立真正的人民民主；建立摆脱帝国主义控制、自力更生的独立的民族经济；建立锡兰各民族的反帝反封建的团结；坚决反对一切帝国主义，特别是全世界的头号敌人美帝国主义，坚决支持一切反对帝国主义的民族解放运动。
    在代表大会后举行的新的中央委员会上，选举了桑穆加塔桑同志为总书记。
