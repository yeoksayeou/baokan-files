The progressive students in some Latin American countries, who are fighting against the reactionary regime's evil rule and brutal suppression of the student movement, are in the midst of a continuous and developing struggle for justice.

On the 17th, one thousand university students in La Plata, Argentina, held a rally to oppose the reactionary government's rule. After the rally, many students took to the streets, singing songs against the reactionary government and bravely retaliating against the reactionary police who came to suppress them with explosives.

In the Chilean capital of Santiago, students from the Normal School of the University of Chile held a protest march on the streets on the evening of the 17th to protest the arrest of eight students from their school on fabricated charges. The protesters shouted slogans, strongly demanding the immediate release of the arrested students. The reactionary police savagely attacked the demonstrators with batons and tear gas, arresting nine more students and injuring some. Since late May, three million university students from the University of Chile and other higher education institutions have been on strike. The students of the University of Chile have occupied all the school buildings and have resolutely resisted the attempts by some revisionist elements to sabotage the strike.

More than two thousand students from the School of Sciences at the Central University of Venezuela also occupied the school buildings on the 17th, demanding that the government increase educational funding. The twenty-five thousand students of this university had gone on a general strike the previous week to support the just struggle of the students of the School of Sciences and other departments.

Additionally, eight thousand middle school teachers in the Colombian capital of Bogotá recently announced an indefinite strike to demand wage increases. Their struggle has received the support of another eight thousand teachers in the province of Cundinamarca.

In Mexico, three thousand primary school teachers also announced a strike on the 17th, demanding wage increases.

In Guayaquil, Ecuador, hundreds of students held a demonstration to demand a reduction in public bus fares and engaged in a brave struggle against the police who came to suppress them.
