The revolutionary committee of the Yanzhuang Mining Bureau, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's support-left personnel, uses Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything. It leads all revolutionary workers in the bureau to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, to firmly grasp the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, and to launch a fierce offensive against the class enemies. They have steadily, accurately, and fiercely struck down a handful of class enemies. In the midst of class struggle, the newly established revolutionary committee has been continuously strengthened and developed, achieving victories in both revolution and production. The entire bureau has completed the state's coal production plan for the first half of the year ahead of schedule by fourteen days.

"Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman, and making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Since the establishment of the bureau's revolutionary committee in December last year, it has firmly grasped the fundamentals and has not been swayed by myriad issues. It has always placed the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, prior to everything, and more important than everything. It uses Mao Zedong Thought to guide all work and to build a new proletarian revolutionary government. The committee follows Chairman Mao's great teaching, "Holding study classes is a good method; many problems can be solved in study classes," and has held 329 study classes of various types. Almost all revolutionary workers in the bureau have participated in these studies. In the study classes, the revolutionary masses have one "loyalty" to the great leader Chairman Mao and one "application" to the great Mao Zedong Thought. They fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, use Mao Zedong Thought to fiercely criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev, and to struggle against the bourgeois "self" in their own minds. This has greatly promoted the thought revolution of the people, strengthened and developed the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and continuously pushed the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the entire bureau to new heights.

Vice Chairman Lin instructed us, "If you do not understand what class is, do not understand what exploitation is, then you do not understand revolution." The revolutionary committee of the Yanzhuang Mining Bureau has conducted serious class education among all workers in the mine, promoting mass "recall and compare" activities. It guides the broad masses of workers to recall the bitterness of the old society and to speak of the sweetness of the new society; to recall the bitterness of China's Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line and to speak of the sweetness of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Class education has greatly aroused everyone's hatred for the old society and for China's Khrushchev, and deepened their love for the new society and for the great leader Chairman Mao.

The results of the revolutionary committee's insistence on using Mao Zedong Thought to educate the masses have brought about significant changes in the spiritual outlook of the broad revolutionary masses. Studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has become the most important daily affair for the broad revolutionary masses. Everyone, with loyalty and love for the great leader Chairman Mao, firmly grasps the revolution and vigorously promotes production. Workers generally ensure that they do not leave their production posts until they have completed their production tasks, handled on-site production accidents, and passed on the shift with Mao Zedong Thought. The broad revolutionary masses have expressed their determination to be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They will be like Comrade Deng Zihui, "thinking of everything for Chairman Mao, obeying everything for Chairman Mao, following everything for Chairman Mao, and doing everything for Chairman Mao," forever being good miners for Chairman Mao and good fighters defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Since the establishment of the bureau's revolutionary committee, the revolution has rapidly developed, and production has steadily risen, with the situation being better than ever. At this time, some comrades in the committee and some revolutionary masses believed that after more than a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the handful of capitalist roaders within the party have been overthrown, and some bad elements have been gradually exposed. The important task now is to produce more coal and better coal, and to build and consolidate the revolutionary committee in the process of developing production. For a period, some comrades focused their energy on organizing stable and high production, busying themselves with planning, proposing measures, and finding ways. Seeing an opportunity, a handful of class enemies stirred up anarchist thoughts and blew the counter-revolutionary economic wind, engaging in rightist reversal activities, attempting to use various conspiratorial means to overthrow the newly established revolutionary committee.

The great leader Chairman Mao pointed out profoundly, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a great political revolution under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and the Kuomintang reactionaries led by the broad revolutionary masses, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Chairman Mao's brilliant instruction has greatly educated and inspired the revolutionary workers of this mining bureau. They realized that the handful of capitalist roaders within the party and the untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in society are always trying to reverse the verdict, overthrow the revolutionary committee, and restore capitalism. After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, our main contradiction is still with this handful of class enemies. Therefore, we must firmly grasp the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, and build and consolidate the new proletarian revolutionary government in the midst of class struggle. They led the broad revolutionary masses to launch a revolutionary criticism of the "class struggle extinction" theory and the "material incentive" and other counter-revolutionary revisionist goods spread by China's Khrushchev and other handful of capitalist roaders within the party. At the same time, they mobilized the masses to expose the hidden traitors, spies, and other counter-revolutionary elements, the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and to firmly strike down the class enemies' reversal wind, cutting off the black hands that secretly blew the anarchist and economic winds, and implementing dictatorship over the handful of class enemies. The committee's firm grasp of class struggle not only achieved new victories in the revolution throughout the mining bureau but also won a great battle in production, with coal production rising steadily.

The living class struggle has made the members of the revolutionary committee and the revolutionary workers further realize that the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching, "Class struggle, once grasped, is effective," is an unbreakable great truth. They said, whether or not to grasp class struggle is a matter of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, a matter of the existence or perishing of the proletarian dictatorship. Only by holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, by deeply and persistently carrying out the revolutionary criticism, and by steadily, accurately, and fiercely striking down the handful of class enemies, can we build and consolidate the revolutionary committee, liberate the productive forces, and promote continuous development in production.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us, "The most fundamental principle of reforming state organs is to connect with the masses." The revolutionary committee of the Yanzhuang Mining Bureau follows Chairman Mao's teachings. Except for a few who stay to handle daily work, all committee members go deep into the field, into the teams, and into the dormitories. They study Chairman Mao's works with the workers, labor with them, make revolution with them, and discuss solving problems in revolution and production with them. They often listen to the masses' opinions and criticisms, consciously placing themselves under the supervision of the masses. They believe that whether or not to go to the masses, whether or not to connect with the masses, is a fundamental attitude towards Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, a matter of class feelings and class stance, and a matter of the direction of building the revolutionary committee. Only by believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and respecting the masses' pioneering spirit, can we build the revolutionary committee into a "revolutionary and mass-connected leading cadre." The leading members of the grassroots revolutionary committee in this bureau also insist on grasping revolution and promoting production with the workers, striving to bring political work, organizational command, and problem-solving to the field. Revolutionary masses reflect, "The revolutionary committee is good. The leading members of the committee are good representatives of us workers!"

    用毛泽东思想挂帅　巩固新生的革命委员会
    窑街矿务局革委会大办毛泽东思想学习班，全局革命和生产不断发展
    新华社兰州二十五日电　甘肃窑街矿务局革命委员会在人民解放军支左人员帮助下，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，率领全局广大革命职工紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，主动地向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，稳、准、狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人。在阶级斗争中，新生的革命委员会不断得到巩固和发展，革命和生产取得双胜利。全局提前十四天超额完成了上半年的国家原煤生产计划。
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。这个局革命委员会去年十二月间成立后，坚定不移抓根本，千头万绪不转向，始终把活学活用毛泽东思想放在高于一切，大于一切，先于一切，重于一切的地位，用毛泽东思想统帅一切工作，用毛泽东思想建设新生的无产阶级革命政权。革委会遵循毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的伟大教导，先后举办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班三百二十九期，全局革命职工基本上都参加了学习。在学习班里，革命群众对伟大领袖毛主席心怀一个
  “忠”字，对伟大的毛泽东思想狠抓一个“用”字，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，用毛泽东思想狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，狠斗自己头脑中的资产阶级“私”字，极大地促进了人的思想革命化，巩固和发展了革命大联合和革命三结合，并且把全局活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动不断推向新的高潮。
    林副主席指示我们：“不懂得什么是阶级，不懂得什么是剥削，就不懂得革命。”窑街矿务局革委会在全矿职工中认真进行了阶级教育，大搞群众性的“忆比”活动，引导广大职工大忆旧社会的苦，大讲新社会的甜；大忆中国赫鲁晓夫资产阶级反动路线的苦，大讲毛主席无产阶级革命路线的甜。阶级教育，大大激发了大家对旧社会和对中国赫鲁晓夫的仇恨，加深了对新社会和对伟大领袖毛主席的热爱。
    窑街矿务局革委会坚持用毛泽东思想教育群众的结果，广大革命职工的精神面貌发生了很大变化。活学活用毛主席著作，已经成为广大革命职工每天生活中头等重要的大事。大家怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的忠诚和热爱，狠抓革命，猛促生产。职工们普遍做到了没有完成生产任务，没有处理好现场的生产事故，没有用毛泽东思想交接班，就不离开生产岗位。广大革命职工表示，要无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，象门合同志那样，“一切想着毛主席，一切服从毛主席，一切紧跟毛主席，一切为着毛主席”，永远做毛主席的好矿工，永远做捍卫毛主席无产阶级革命路线的好战士。
    这个局革委会成立以后，革命迅速发展，生产稳步上升，形势空前大好。这时，革委会有的同志和一些革命群众认为，经过一年多的无产阶级文化大革命，党内一小撮走资派已经被打倒，一些坏人陆续被挖出来，重要的任务就是多出煤，出好煤，在发展生产中建设和巩固革命委员会。有一段时间，有些同志把精力集中在组织稳产高产上，忙于订计划，提措施，想办法。一小撮阶级敌人觉得有机可乘，便煽动无政府主义思潮，刮起反革命经济主义妖风，大搞右倾翻案活动，妄图用各种阴谋手段颠覆新生的革命委员会。
  伟大领袖毛主席非常深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”毛主席这一光辉指示，极大地教育和鼓舞了这个矿务局的革命职工。他们认识到，党内一小撮走资派和社会上没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，时刻都在妄想翻案，颠覆革命委员会，复辟资本主义。革命委员会成立以后，我们同这一小撮阶级敌人的矛盾，仍然是主要矛盾。因此，必须狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，在阶级斗争中建设和巩固新生的无产阶级革命政权。他们带领广大革命群众，对中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派所散布的“阶级斗争熄灭”论以及“物质刺激”等反革命修正主义黑货，开展了革命的大批判，同时放手发动群众，挖出了隐藏的一小撮叛徒、特务和其他反革命分子等国民党反动派的残渣余孽，狠狠打击了阶级敌人的翻案妖风，斩断了在暗地里大刮无政府主义和经济主义妖风的黑手，对一小撮阶级敌人实行了群众专政。革委会狠抓阶级斗争，不仅使全矿务局的革命取得了新的胜利，生产上也打了大胜仗，煤炭产量节节上升。
    活生生的阶级斗争现实使革委会的全体成员以及革命职工进一步体会到，伟大领袖毛主席教导的“阶级斗争，一抓就灵”，是颠扑不破的伟大真理。他们说，抓不抓阶级斗争，是对伟大领袖毛主席忠不忠的问题，是关系到无产阶级政权存亡的问题。只有高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，深入持久地开展革命大批判，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，才能建设和巩固革命委员会，才能解放生产力，推动生产不断发展。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”窑街矿务局革命委员会遵照毛主席的教导，除留少数人值班处理日常工作以外，其他委员都深入现场，深入班组，深入宿舍，和工人一同学习毛主席著作，一同劳动，一同闹革命，一同商量解决革命和生产中的问题。他们经常听取群众的意见和批评，自觉地把自己置于群众的监督之下。他们认为，到不到群众中去，能不能同群众心连心，是对待毛主席无产阶级革命路线的根本态度问题，是阶级感情和阶级立场问题，是革命委员会的建设方向问题。只有相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，才能把革命委员会建设成为“革命化的联系群众的领导班子”。这个局基层革命委员会的领导成员，也坚持和工人一起抓革命促生产，努力做到政治工作到现场，组织指挥到现场，解决问题到现场。革命群众反映说：“革命委员会就是好。革委会的领导成员，是我们工人的好代表！”
