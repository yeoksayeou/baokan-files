Joint Military and Civilian Operations Bravely Attack the Enemy and Achieve Major Victories

In the six months from November 1967 to April 1968, the patriotic military and civilian forces of various provinces in southern Laos united in action, bravely attacking and intercepting the enemy, inflicting heavy losses on them.

According to incomplete statistics, the military and civilian forces of various provinces in southern Laos destroyed and dismantled 2,215 enemy personnel during this period, shot down 51 enemy aircraft, damaged more than 70, destroyed 36 military vehicles, burned eight ammunition and fuel depots, blew up six bridges, and seized a large amount of weapons and military supplies.

Among the destroyed enemies, three enemy companies were completely annihilated, and eight battalions were severely damaged.

According to another report from the Pathet Lao radio station, the patriotic military and civilian forces of Laos continued to take the initiative to strike the enemy in the first 20 days of May, annihilating more than 300 enemy personnel and seizing a large number of weapons, ammunition, and military supplies.

According to a report from the Pathet Lao News Agency, the patriotic military and civilian forces of Phongsaly Province in Laos annihilated 1,446 bandits raised by U.S. imperialism in the six-month dry season from 1967 to 1968, achieving significant victories.

The report said that from last November to this April, the patriotic military and civilian forces of this province launched a powerful offensive against the bandits who were rampaging in this province. A large number of bandits disintegrated, with 1,134 surrendering to the patriotic military and civilian forces. At the same time, the patriotic military and civilian forces also captured important strongholds of the bandits such as Ou Doi and Ou Noy, seized a large number of weapons, ammunition, and military supplies, and liberated 27,000 residents.

According to a report from the Pathet Lao News Agency, under the heavy blows of the patriotic military and civilian forces, the morale of the broad masses of soldiers in the right-wing army of Laos is increasingly low, and they are flocking to surrender to the people.

From March 12 to May 2, 142 pseudo-military soldiers who fled into the forests around the Bathe area surrendered to the people.

Recently, 60 pseudo-military soldiers in Saravane, Xieng Khouang, and Phongsaly provinces also surrendered to the people with their weapons.

At the end of April, all 151 officers and soldiers of two special forces companies of the pseudo-military in the Tongshan region of Udomxay Province killed the scoundrels and surrendered to the liberated area with their weapons.

The officers and soldiers of a pseudo-military battalion stationed in Savannakhet Province are flocking to leave the enemy ranks and turn to the light.

So far, this battalion has only about 100 people left.
