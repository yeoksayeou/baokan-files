Tanzanian leaders from various sectors recently spoke to Xinhua News Agency reporters in Dar es Salaam, praising the friendship between China and Tanzania and expressing their warm wishes for President Nyerere's visit to China, which they believe will further strengthen the friendship and unity between the two countries.

Tanzania's National Assembly Speaker, Adam Sapi Mkwawa, said, "I wish the President a successful visit to the great nation of the People's Republic of China." He added, "Since the Cultural Revolution, China must have undergone many changes and developments." "I am confident that President Nyerere's second visit will further strengthen our friendship." Mkwawa, discussing the rapid development of friendly relations between the two countries in recent years, said, "Because both our countries have suffered from colonialism and imperialism, we have faced similar difficulties in the past, and we naturally have common feelings to help each other in the development of both countries."

Tanzania's Minister of Health and Housing, O. Shaba, told Xinhua News Agency reporters, "President Nyerere's visit to China will promote solidarity between our two countries."

He emphasized that Tanzania and the People's Republic of China have many similarities in their historical backgrounds, leading to a deep mutual understanding and common issues, one of which is the struggle against imperialism until victory.

The minister wished President Nyerere a pleasant visit to China and long life to Chairman Mao Zedong!

The National Secretary of the Tanganyika African National Union, Msekwa, told Xinhua News Agency reporters, "The Tanganyika African National Union is extremely pleased that President Nyerere is once again visiting the People's Republic of China on a state visit." He said that this visit will certainly further strengthen the friendly relations between the peoples of the two countries.

He recalled that since the mutual visits of President Nyerere and Premier Zhou Enlai, "the peoples of the two countries have become closer, and now the people of Tanzania are watching with great admiration the progress that the Chinese people are making."

The Secretary-General of the Afro-Shirazi Party and Minister of Trade of Zanzibar, Sabiti Komba, told Xinhua News Agency reporters that President Nyerere's visit to China "will not only further strengthen the friendship between China and Tanzania but will also enhance the friendship between the Chinese people and the people of East Africa."

He said, "Under the guidance of Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people are working even harder. We, the people of Tanzania and Zanzibar, highly appreciate the efforts and work of the Chinese people and regard them as our brothers."

The General Secretary of the Tanganyika Federation of Labor, Kamaliza, told Xinhua News Agency reporters that President Nyerere's visit "will certainly strengthen the friendship and unity between the people of Tanzania and China" and will give the leaders of the two countries the opportunity to exchange views on international issues.

This trade union leader praised the rapid development of friendship between China and Tanzania. He said, "China's assistance in building the railway is very good, which will enable us to establish transportation links with our Zambian brothers." He emphasized, "This is a great contribution made by China to the economic development of my country."

The General Manager of the Tanzania Friendship Textile Printing Factory and member of the Tanzanian Parliament, Tando, told Xinhua News Agency reporters that President Nyerere's visit to China is "a symbol of our deep relationship." He praised China's aid as genuine aid. He pointed out, "Imperialism and colonialism want to exploit the people of developing countries, and now they see our unity as a threat to them because they can no longer exploit there."

He said, "Through mutual friendly visits, we can further strengthen our friendship and learn from each other."
