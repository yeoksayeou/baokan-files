Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao received military cadres. This is the greatest care, the greatest concern, the greatest education, and the greatest encouragement for us. This is the greatest happiness in my life.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! When we old revolutionaries see that you are in excellent health and full of vigor, our hearts are filled with excitement and happiness. Your health is the greatest guarantee of revolutionary victory; your health is the highest wish of revolutionary soldiers. At this most happy moment, we shout with all our hearts, long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! We wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life!

Dear Chairman Mao, more than thirty years ago, I guarded by your side day and night. Your brilliant thoughts illuminate our revolutionary path, and your great practices inspire us to press forward bravely. Your genius surpasses the heavens, and your wisdom is deeper than the sea. At every critical moment in the Chinese revolution, you always lead the revolutionary army and the masses in a thorough revolutionary spirit and great revolutionary daring to fight bravely against the class enemy. At the critical moment of the revolution, it was you who corrected the wrong line at the Zunyi Conference, rectified the revolutionary course, and led the Red Army on the famous Long March of 25,000 li. On the eve of crossing the Dadu River, you not only personally directed the army to cross the river but also went deep into the masses to solve one problem after another. When seizing the strategic pass of Lazi Kou, you personally came to the company's position, observed the terrain, and organized the battle. After the Red Army arrived in Shaanxi, when I, an ordinary soldier, was wounded in the battle of Zheluo Town, how much you cared for and cherished me! You stretched out your mighty arm and personally helped me onto the stretcher.

These happy memories make me deeply feel that: being by your side is the greatest happiness, being by your side gives us boundless strength, following you is the direction, following you is victory. The great practice of the Chinese revolution, especially in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, makes me deeply feel that: closely following your brilliant thoughts, closely following your revolutionary line, the revolution will be victorious; slightly deviating from your brilliant thoughts, deviating from your revolutionary line, the revolution will suffer losses. Your brilliant thoughts are forever our soul; your revolutionary line is forever our lifeline.

Today, when the hundreds of millions of soldiers and people across the country are following your great strategic deployment to seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, you receive military cadres and soldiers. This is a new battle order issued to us. We will definitely turn your great concern for us into a great driving force for continuous progress; we will implement your latest instructions in practical actions. I will definitely respond to your call, learn from Comrade Tan Zhong, and be a good soldier in executing and defending your revolutionary line. I will lead the troops to charge in this political revolution and seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    紧跟毛主席就是胜利
    革命老战士　游好扬
    我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席，接见了军队干部，这是对我们的最大关怀，最大爱护，最大教育，最大鼓舞。这是我一生中最大的幸福。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！当我们这些老战士见到您老人家身体非常非常健康，精力非常非常充沛的时候，心里是多么激动，多么幸福。您老人家的健康，就是革命胜利的最大保证；您老人家的健康，是革命战士最崇高的愿望。在这最幸福的时刻，我们纵情欢呼，毛主席万岁！万万岁！祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    敬爱的毛主席，三十多年前我日日夜夜守卫在您的身边。您的光辉思想照耀着我们革命的前程，您的伟大实践鼓舞着我们奋勇前进。您的天才比天高，您的智慧比海深。在中国革命的每一个历史关头，您总是以无产阶级革命家最彻底的革命精神，最伟大的革命胆略，率领革命军队和广大人民向阶级敌人进行英勇的斗争。在革命危急的关头，是您在遵义会议上，纠正了错误路线，端正了革命的航向，率领红军进行了举世闻名的二万五千里长征。在强渡大渡河的前夕，您不仅亲临前线部署大军渡河，还深入到群众之中，解决一个一个的具体问题。在抢占天险腊子口的时候，您亲自来到连队的阵地上，观察地形，组织战斗。在红军到达陕北以后，当我这个普通战士在直罗镇战斗中负了伤，您老人家是多么关心、爱护我啊，您伸出巨大的手臂，亲自扶我上担架。
    这些幸福的回忆，使我深深地体会到：在您的身边就是最大的幸福，在您的身边，就有无穷无尽的力量，跟着您就是方向，跟着您就是胜利。中国革命的伟大实践，特别是在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，更加使我深深地体会到：紧跟您的光辉思想，紧跟您的革命路线，革命就胜利；稍稍背离您的光辉思想，背离您的革命路线，革命就受损失。您的光辉思想，永远是我们的灵魂；您的革命路线，永远是我们的生命线。
    今天，当全国亿万军民紧跟您老人家的伟大战略部署，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大时刻，您老人家接见军队干部和战士，这是向我们发出的新的战斗号令。我们一定把您对我们的巨大关怀，当作不断前进的巨大动力；把您的一系列最新指示落实在实际行动中。我一定响应您老人家的号召，向门合同志学习，做执行和捍卫您的革命路线的好战士，带领部队在这场政治大革命中冲锋陷阵，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
