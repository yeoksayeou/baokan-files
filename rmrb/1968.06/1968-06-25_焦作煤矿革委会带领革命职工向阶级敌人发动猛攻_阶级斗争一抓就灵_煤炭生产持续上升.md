The Revolutionary Committee of Jiaozuo Coal Mine, with the help of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the mine, has been strictly following the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, "Never forget class struggle," and has been focusing on class struggle. This has continuously raised the class struggle and two-line struggle awareness of the broad revolutionary workers, united all possible forces, and accurately and fiercely struck down a handful of class enemies. They have smashed the evil plots of class enemies who attempted to sabotage coal production and overthrow the newly established Revolutionary Committees, greatly developing the revolutionary and production situation.

Currently, the revolutionary unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination in Jiaozuo Coal Mine are more consolidated and developed, and coal production continues to rise significantly. In May, the entire Jiaozuo system completed the monthly production task four days ahead of schedule, with the total production exceeding the national plan by 17.9%. In the first half of June, the national plan was completed two days ahead of schedule.

Chairman Mao teaches us, "All revolutionary struggles in the world are aimed at seizing power, consolidating power. The reactionaries, in their desperate struggle against the revolutionary forces, are also fighting to maintain their power." Just as the Revolutionary Committees at various levels in the Jiaozuo mining area were being established one after another, a handful of class enemies, in an attempt to save their doomed fate, eagerly jumped out. They spread rumors and stirred up trouble, attempting to use bourgeois factionalism to split the revolutionary ranks and overthrow the newly established Revolutionary Committees. They also used counter-revolutionary economism and anarchism to corrupt workers and incite miners to leave their underground positions, sabotaging coal production.

Facing this sharp and complex struggle, the Revolutionary Committees at various levels in Jiaozuo Coal Mine and the broad revolutionary masses, with the help of the stationed PLA, carefully analyzed the new situation, new characteristics, and new trends of the current class struggle. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its leadership of the broad revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions, like a beacon, helped the Revolutionary Committees at various levels in Jiaozuo Coal Mine and the broad revolutionary masses see the direction of the struggle and clarify their combat tasks. They immediately focused on revolutionary criticism, launching a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies, and while thoroughly exposing the evil plots of class enemies, they paid attention to educating and uniting the broad revolutionary masses, making a handful of class enemies fall into the vast sea of people's war. Soon, the entire mining area, from the surface to underground, from the mining areas, teams to the miners' dormitories, posted thousands of revolutionary big-character posters, held thousands of large and small criticism meetings, and set up revolutionary criticism battlefields everywhere. The Revolutionary Committees of Fengying Mine and Jiaoxi Mine organized miners by teams, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, fiercely criticizing the reactionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev and other capitalist-roaders within the Party, and combining the struggle against selfishness with the criticism of revisionism, making the broad workers further recognize that the revisionist goods advocated by China's Khrushchev and other capitalist-roaders within the Party, such as "material incentives" and "profit-first," are poisonous drugs wrapped in sugar coats. The revolutionary workers of Zhucun Mine, in launching a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies within the unit, compared the various reactionary words and deeds of this handful of class enemies with the reactionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev and other capitalist-roaders within the Party, using Mao Zedong Thought to criticize, making the various plots and tricks of this handful of class enemies completely exposed in broad daylight. The class consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary workers have been greatly enhanced in the struggle. Just as the broad revolutionary miners in Jiaozuo were actively launching fierce attacks on class enemies, the class enemies deliberately confused the two types of contradictions of different natures, attempting to disrupt the class lines to cover up their own tracks. Some workers were temporarily deceived by the plots and tricks of class enemies. The Revolutionary Committees at various levels, with the help of the stationed PLA, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's discussions on correctly handling the problems of the two types of contradictions of different natures, guiding the broad revolutionary workers to strictly distinguish between the two types of contradictions of different natures, uniting all possible forces, and directing the spearhead at a handful of true class enemies.

Revolution is the locomotive driving production forward. The Jiaozuo coal miners, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, through the practice of class struggle, deeply realized that only by focusing on the revolution can production be vigorously promoted. They resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," putting their infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao and the boundless enthusiasm released in the Cultural Revolution into production, promoting a significant increase in raw coal production. In May, the seven coal mines under the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau, including Wangfeng, Lifeng, Zhucun, Jiaoxi, Xiaomazhuang, Yanmazhuang, and Fengying, all completed the national coal production plan ahead of schedule and exceeded the quota, presenting a rare and joyful scene of a full house of red throughout the system.

Currently, the broad revolutionary workers of Jiaozuo Coal Mine, inspired by the great news of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin receiving the representatives attending the National Coal Mine Revolution and Production Conference, are determined to take Comrade Wang Hongwen, who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, as a shining example, to fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, to carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, to focus on the revolution, to vigorously promote production, and to strive for greater achievements in June.

    焦作煤矿革委会带领革命职工向阶级敌人发动猛攻
    阶级斗争一抓就灵　煤炭生产持续上升
    新华社郑州二十四日电　河南省焦作煤矿各级革命委员会，在驻矿人民解放军的帮助下，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，狠抓阶级斗争，不断提高广大革命职工的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，团结一切可以团结的力量，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，粉碎了阶级敌人妄图破坏煤矿生产和颠覆新生的革命委员会的罪恶阴谋，大大发展了革命和生产的大好形势。
    现在，焦作煤矿的革命大联合和革命三结合更加巩固和发展，煤炭产量持续地大幅度上升。五月份，焦作全局原煤产量提前四天完成全月生产任务，总产量超过国家计划百分之十七点九。六月份前半月又提前两天完成国家计划。
    毛主席教导我们说：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”正当焦作矿区各级革命委员会一个接一个地诞生的时候，一小撮阶级敌人为了挽救他们灭亡的命运，迫不及待地跳了出来，他们煽阴风，点邪火，妄图利用资产阶级派性，分裂革命队伍，颠覆新生的革命委员会。他们还利用反革命经济主义和无政府主义腐蚀工人、挑唆矿工离开井下岗位，破坏煤炭生产。
    面对这种尖锐复杂的斗争，焦作煤矿各级革委会和广大无产阶级革命派，在驻矿解放军的帮助下，认真地分析了当前阶级斗争的新形势、新特点、新动向。他们反复学习了毛主席的最新指示：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”毛主席的英明指示，象一盏明灯，使焦作煤矿各级革委会和广大无产阶级革命派看清了斗争方向，明确了战斗任务。他们立即狠抓革命大批判，向一小撮阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，并且在彻底揭露阶级敌人的罪恶阴谋时，注意教育和团结广大革命群众，使一小撮阶级敌人陷入了“人民战争”的汪洋大海之中。很快，全矿区从井上到井下，从采煤区、班组到矿工宿舍，贴出了千万张革命的大字报，召开了千百次大小批判会，遍地摆开了革命大批判的战场。冯营矿和焦西矿的革委会，组织矿工以班、组为单位，以毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派的反革命修正主义路线，并且把斗私和批修结合起来，使广大职工进一步认清了中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派所鼓吹的“物质刺激”“利润挂帅”等修正主义黑货，都是裹着糖衣的毒药。朱村矿的革命职工，在向本单位的一小撮阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻中，把这一小撮阶级敌人的种种反动言行同中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派的反革命修正主义路线对照起来，用毛泽东思想进行批判，使这一小撮阶级敌人的各种阴谋诡计完全暴露在光天化日之下。广大革命职工的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟在斗争中有很大提高。正当焦作广大革命矿工向阶级敌人主动地发动猛烈进攻的时候，阶级敌人故意混淆两类不同性质矛盾，妄图搞乱阶级阵线，以使自己蒙混过关。部分职工一度中了阶级敌人的阴谋诡计。各矿革委会在驻矿解放军的帮助下，反复学习了毛主席关于正确处理两类不同性质矛盾问题的论述，引导广大革命职工严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，团结一切可以团结的力量，把矛头对准一小撮真正的阶级敌人。
  革命是带动生产前进的火车头。无限忠于毛主席革命路线的焦作煤矿工人，通过阶级斗争的实践，深刻地认识到：只有狠抓革命，才能猛促生产。他们坚决贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的方针，把无限忠于毛主席的一片忠心，把在文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲，用到生产上去，促进了原煤产量的大幅度上升。五月份，焦作矿务局所属的王封、李封、朱村、焦西、小马村、演马庄、冯营等七个煤矿都提前超额完成了国家煤炭生产计划，出现了历史上少有的全局满堂红的可喜局面。
    现在，焦作煤矿的广大革命职工，在我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席接见出席全国煤矿抓革命、促生产会议的代表的特大喜讯鼓舞下，决心以无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部门合同志为光辉榜样，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，狠抓革命，猛促生产，争取在六月份创造出更大成绩。
