Under the guise of "aid," American monopoly capital has further infiltrated Guyana's crucial mining and industrial sectors. In 1965, Reynolds Metals, one of the four major aluminum companies in the United States, secured a 25-year mining privilege in Guyana and the right to explore an area of over 120,000 acres. Subsequently, American monopoly capital extended its reach into the oil industry, allowing companies like Texaco and Continental to obtain rights for oil exploration and extraction. Last June, American companies, through an agreement signed with the Burnham government, gained control over Guyana's rice industry.

Under the aggression and plunder of American imperialism, the Guyanese people are stripped of 50 million Guyanese dollars in profits annually by imperialist enterprises. Despite a population of over 600,000, the country has 36,000 unemployed individuals, and 18,000 young people are unable to find jobs.

    掠夺圭亚那资源剥削圭亚那人民
    美国垄断资本在“援助”的名义下，进一步渗入圭亚那的重要工矿部门。一九六五年，美国四大铝业公司之一的雷诺斯金属公司取得了在圭亚那采矿二十五年的特权，并且可以在一块面积达一百二十多万英亩的土地上进行勘探。接着，美国垄断资本又进一步插手石油业，使美国的德士古、大陆等石油公司相继取得了开采和勘探石油的特权。去年六月，美国公司又通过同伯纳姆政府签订的一项协定，控制了圭亚那的大米业。
    圭亚那人民在美帝国主义的侵略和掠夺下，每年被帝国主义企业搜刮去五千万圭元利润，而在全国六十多万人口中，却有三万六千人失业，一万八千名青年找不到职业。
