The revolutionary teachers and students of Zhejiang Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Art University, following Chairman Mao's guidance on literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, have been holding painting study classes for workers, peasants, and soldiers both on and off campus since last November. They have trained batches of workers, peasants, and soldiers in painting. These students, with deep proletarian feelings for our great leader Chairman Mao, have created a large number of giant portraits of Chairman Mao and propaganda posters reflecting the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. These works have been warmly praised by the broad revolutionary masses and the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary teachers and students of Zhejiang Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Art University have held high the banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought, exposed and criticized the crimes of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and bourgeois academic "authorities" in promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational and artistic lines, and launched a surging tide of educational reform. Under the leadership of the revolutionary committee, the broad revolutionary teachers and students have repeatedly and seriously studied Chairman Mao's brilliant guidance: "Our literature and art are for the people, for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and for the workers, peasants, and soldiers to use." On the one hand, they have gone deep into factories, people's communes, and platoons to paint portraits of Chairman Mao for the workers, peasants, and soldiers. On the other hand, to meet the demands of the broad revolutionary masses, they have held four sessions of painting study classes for workers, peasants, and soldiers on campus and in the Zhoushan Archipelago since last November. The students participating in the classes include soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, revolutionary workers and commune members, as well as revolutionary cadres from provincial and municipal organs.

The painting study classes for workers, peasants, and soldiers are led by Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing proletarian politics. From the beginning, the classes have conducted class education on recalling bitterness and sweetness, studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," and armed themselves with Mao Zedong Thought. In teaching, the principle of "officers teaching soldiers, soldiers teaching officers, and soldiers teaching soldiers" is implemented. Teachers and students help and inspire each other, giving full play to the collective wisdom and role.

Most of the workers, peasants, and soldiers participating in the classes have no painting experience. When they encounter difficulties in their studies, they learn from Chairman Mao's quotations: "Resolutely take the road of revolution, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." This gives them boundless courage. Some students, in order to paint a good portrait of Chairman Mao, often forget to eat and sleep. Because the students pour their deep proletarian feelings of boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao into their studies, generally after 40 to 50 days of study, they master the basic skills of oil painting and can paint good portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao.

The painting study classes for workers, peasants, and soldiers held by Zhejiang Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Art University have been warmly praised by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Revolutionary cadres and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Ningbo, and Zhoushan have erected the portraits of Chairman Mao painted by the students, which are full of spirit and radiance, in their regions and units, letting the broad revolutionary masses see Chairman Mao's brilliant image every day. Many workers and poor and lower-middle peasants say: We see Chairman Mao's portraits every day, as if we are by Chairman Mao's side. We have more energy to make revolution and more strength to produce.

    遵照毛主席关于文艺为工农兵服务的教导
    浙江工农兵美术大学举办工农兵绘画学习班
    新华社杭州二十九日电　浙江工农兵美术大学的革命师生，遵照毛主席关于文艺为工农兵服务的教导，从去年十一月开始，在校内、校外连续举办工农兵绘画学习班，培训出一批批工农兵绘画学员。这些学员怀着对我们伟大领袖毛主席无比深厚的无产阶级感情，绘制出大量巨幅毛主席画像，和反映无产阶级文化大革命伟大胜利的宣传画，受到广大革命人民群众和人民解放军指战员的热烈赞扬。
    浙江工农兵美术大学的革命师生，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，高举毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，揭发、批判了党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级反动学术“权威”推行反革命修正主义教育路线和文艺路线的罪行，掀起了轰轰烈烈的教学改革的热潮。在校革命委员会的领导下，广大革命师生，反复认真地学习了毛主席的光辉教导：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”他们一方面深入工厂、人民公社和连队，为工农兵画毛主席像，同时适应广大革命群众的要求，从去年十一月起，先后在校内和舟山群岛举办了四期工农兵绘画学习班。参加学习班的学员有人民解放军指战员，有革命工人和公社社员，也有来自省市机关的无产阶级革命派。
    工农兵绘画学习班用毛泽东思想挂帅，突出无产阶级政治。学习班一开始，就进行忆苦思甜的阶级教育，学习毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》等光辉著作，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑。在教学中实行“官教兵、兵教官、兵教兵”的方针，教员和学员互相帮助，互相启发，发挥集体的智慧和作用。
    参加学习班的工农兵学员，大都没有绘画的经验。他们在学习中碰到困难时，就学习毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”增添了无穷的勇气。有的学员为画好毛主席像，常常忘记了吃饭，忘记了睡觉。由于学员们把对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的深厚无产阶级感情，倾注到学习中去，一般经过四、五十天的学习，就掌握了油画的基本技能，能画好伟大领袖毛主席像。
    浙江工农兵美术大学举办工农兵绘画学习班，受到广大工农兵群众的热烈称赞。杭州、嘉兴、宁波、舟山等地的无产阶级革命派和人民解放军指战员，把学员们画的一幅幅神采奕奕、容光焕发的毛主席像，矗立在本地区、本单位，让广大革命群众天天看到毛主席的光辉形象。许多工人和贫下中农说：我们天天看到毛主席画像，就象在毛主席身边一样，干革命格外有劲，搞生产格外有力。
