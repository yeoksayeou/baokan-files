Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the summer crops of City West Lake Farm, reclaimed by a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, have achieved a bumper harvest. The total wheat yield is more than double that of last year. This is the result of the broad masses of cadres and soldiers, who, with a heart full of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, grasp the use of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, carry out thorough revolutionary criticism, promote the revolutionization of thought, and create abundant achievements.

The establishment of City West Lake Farm is a great victory of Chairman Mao's brilliant "May 7th" directive. The broad masses of cadres and soldiers regard the struggle at City West Lake as a battlefield for promoting the revolutionization of thought. They are determined to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian military line with practical actions of transforming the world. No matter how harsh the environment, how poor the conditions, how heavy the tasks, or how tight the time, they firmly implement the great directive of the great leader Chairman Mao that "the People's Liberation Army should be a great school," placing the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought at the forefront of all work, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything. At the same time, they follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "participating in the cultural revolution struggle against the bourgeoisie at all times," turning the hot labor sites into battlefields for criticizing the bourgeois military line. They criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of "military first," "technology first," and "business first" advocated by the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan, greatly enhancing the cadres' and soldiers' class struggle awareness and awareness of the two-line struggle. By focusing on the revolution, the broad masses of cadres and soldiers have reached a new height in the revolutionization of thought, unleashing tremendous material force. They reclaimed the land, sowed the seeds, and harvested a good yield in the same year. Since then, this farm has increased production and achieved bumper harvests year after year.

  “忠”字，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想狠抓一个“用”字，深入开展革命大批判，促进思想革命化，创造出来的丰硕成果。
    城西湖农场的建成，是毛主席光辉“五·七”指示的伟大胜利。广大指战员把奋战城西湖，当作促进思想革命化的战场，决心用改天换地的实际行动，捍卫毛主席的无产阶级建军路线。环境再苦，条件再差，任务再重，时间再紧，他们坚定不移地执行伟大领袖毛主席“人民解放军应该是一个大学校”的伟大指示，把活学活用毛泽东思想放在一切工作的首位，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想统帅一切。同时，他们遵循毛主席“又要随时参加批判资产阶级的文化革命斗争”的教导，把火热的劳动现场，变成了批判资产阶级军事路线的战场，对反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿所推行的“军事第一”、“技术第一”、“业务第一”的反革命修正主义路线进行了批判，大大提高了指战员的阶级斗争觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟。由于狠抓革命，广大干部战士的思想革命化达到了新的高度，发挥出巨大的物质力量。当年开荒，当年播种，当年获得好收成。从此，这个农场年年增产，年年丰收。
