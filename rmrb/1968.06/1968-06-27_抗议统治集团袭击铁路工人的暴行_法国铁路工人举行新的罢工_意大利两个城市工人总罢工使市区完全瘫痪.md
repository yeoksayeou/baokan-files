Paris, June 26 (New China News Agency) — As the French ruling class, in collusion with the French revisionist traitor clique and the yellow unions, threatens and entices workers from various industries to resume work, railway workers in the Paris suburbs staged a new strike on June 25 to protest against the ruling class's instigation of thugs to attack railway workers.

On the evening of June 24, a group of thugs instigated by the French ruling class provoked a group of passing railway workers in the Paris suburb of Clichy. The thugs even opened fire on the workers, injuring one and beating several others with clubs. The railway workers in the Paris suburbs, who had recently participated in a nationwide strike with railway workers across the country, were outraged by this new atrocity by the French ruling class and decided to go on strike for six hours on June 25.

From noon to 6 PM Paris time, all trains in the western suburbs of Paris were halted. The railway authorities attempted to disrupt the strike by forcibly sending out trains from the Saint-Lazare station, but the striking workers bravely lay down on the tracks, blocking the trains.

The renewed strike by the Paris suburban railway workers has made the French ruling class extremely uneasy. The ruling class has used various threats and inducements to entice workers who began striking in May to resume work, but so far, many workers remain on strike. As of June 25, thousands of workers in various enterprises in the Paris and Lyon regions are still on strike. More than 4,000 workers at the Usinor steel plant in Dunkirk rejected the conditions for resuming work concocted by the management and the yellow unions and announced that they would continue the strike. The strike by reporters, directors, and performers at the French National Radio and Television has entered its 38th day.

On June 22, technicians at the Eiffel Tower in Paris went on strike, demanding a wage increase. The strike temporarily halted the tower's elevators.

Rome, June 26 (New China News Agency) — Workers from various industries in the northern Italian port city of Trieste went on a 24-hour general strike on June 25 to protest against the police's brutal suppression of striking shipbuilders and metallurgical workers and to demand full employment.

The general strike brought the city of Trieste to a complete standstill. Offices and shops were closed, public transportation was halted, and even newspapers could not be published.

The central Italian city of Pisa was also paralyzed by a general strike on June 24. Workers from various industries in the city went on strike to support the workers of the "Mazzetto" wool mill in their struggle against the management's closure of the factory and their fight for the right to work.

That day, thousands of workers, citizens, and a large number of students in Pisa held a demonstration in the square of the wool mill and then marched to the city hall to hold another demonstration. The workers of the wool mill set up tents and established a headquarters inside the factory, patrolling day and night to prevent the management from removing the machinery.

    抗议统治集团袭击铁路工人的暴行
    法国铁路工人举行新的罢工
    意大利两个城市工人总罢工使市区完全瘫痪
    新华社二十六日讯　巴黎消息：正当法国统治集团伙同法修叛徒集团及黄色工会威胁和诱骗法国各行业的罢工工人全面复工的时候，巴黎郊区铁路工人二十五日又举行新的罢工，抗议法国统治集团唆使暴徒袭击铁路工人。
    二十四日晚上，法国统治集团唆使的一批暴徒在巴黎郊区克利希向一群过路的铁路工人挑衅，暴徒竟向工人开枪，一名工人被打伤，另有几名工人被暴徒用棍棒等打伤。不久前同全国铁路工人一起进行了全国性罢工斗争的巴黎郊区铁路工人，对法国统治集团这一新的暴行十分愤慨，二十五日决定举行六小时罢工。
    从巴黎时间十二点到下午六点，巴黎西郊的火车全部停驶，铁路当局企图破坏工人罢工，从圣拉扎尔车站强行开出火车，但是罢工工人英勇地躺在铁轨上，把火车挡住。
    巴黎郊区铁路工人的再次罢工，使法国统治集团十分不安。法国统治集团为诱骗在五月间开始罢工的各行业工人全部复工，使尽了各种威胁利诱的手段，但迄今为止，仍有许多工人坚持罢工。截至二十五日，巴黎地区和里昂地区一些企业的数千名工人仍在坚持罢工。敦刻尔克的尤西诺钢铁厂的四千多名工人拒绝了资方和黄色工会合谋炮制的复工条件，宣布继续罢工。法国国家广播电视台的记者和电视广播的导演和演员的罢工，二十五日已经进入第三十八天。
    二十二日，巴黎埃菲尔铁塔的技术人员举行罢工，要求增加工资。罢工使铁塔的电梯一度停开。
    新华社二十六日讯　罗马消息：意大利北部大港的里亚斯特各行业的工人，二十五日举行二十四小时总罢工，抗议警察当局对坚持罢工的造船工人和冶金工人的野蛮镇压，并且要求充分就业。
    总罢工使的里亚斯特市完全陷于瘫痪。机关、商店关门，公共交通车辆停驶，甚至连报纸也发行不出去。
    意大利中部城市彼萨二十四日也因总罢工而陷于瘫痪。这个城市各行各业工人举行这次总罢工，是为了声援“马佐托”毛纺厂的工人反对资方关闭工厂、争取工作权利的斗争。
    当天，彼萨的数千名工人、市民和大批学生，在毛纺厂的广场上举行示威后又列队到市政府门前举行了示威。毛纺厂的工人们还在厂内搭起帐篷并设立了总部，昼夜巡逻，防止资方把机器搬走。
