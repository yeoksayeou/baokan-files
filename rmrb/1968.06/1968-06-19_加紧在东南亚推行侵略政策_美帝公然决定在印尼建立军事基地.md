The U.S. imperialists, taking advantage of the open door provided by the Suharto-Nasution traitorous clique in Indonesia, are intensifying their military and economic control over the country.

According to reports, due to the betrayal of the Indonesian people's sovereignty by the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime, the U.S. imperialists have brazenly decided to establish military bases in several places in Indonesia, including Cilacap. Recent reports from Jakarta reveal that U.S. government officials are studying various strategic ports in Indonesia. The U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia, Green, and the military attaché have recently visited several ports in Central Java and Sumatra to engage in conspiratorial activities. On January 15 of this year, the U.S. and the Indonesian reactionary authorities signed an air transport agreement, allowing U.S. aircraft to land freely in Jakarta, Bali, and other locations. According to the U.S. official publication "Foreign Policy Summary" in April, the U.S. government plans to "continue providing military aid to the Indonesian Army."

To prop up the right-wing military regime of Suharto-Nasution, which is in unprecedented difficulties, the U.S. imperialists have been continuously providing "loans" and "aid" to this group over the past few months. According to the Jakarta "Hope Light" newspaper on May 29, following the $60 million "loan" provided by the U.S. to Indonesia in February this year, the U.S. recently agreed to provide an additional $140 million in "aid" to purchase American rice, flour, and other goods. The report states that the total amount of "aid" the U.S. will provide to the Indonesian fascist military regime this year will reach $250 million.

According to earlier revelations from the U.S. "Foreign Policy Summary," the U.S. government has already agreed to extend the repayment period for Indonesia's large dollar debt.

The actions of U.S. imperialism are entirely aimed at further controlling Indonesia and intensifying its aggressive policies in Southeast Asia. U.S. President Johnson admitted on February 8 of this year, when discussing the U.S. 1968 "foreign aid message," that providing "loans" and "aid" to the Indonesian fascist military regime is "completely in our interests."

### 加紧在东南亚推行侵略政策  美帝公然决定在印尼建立军事基地

    加紧在东南亚推行侵略政策
    美帝公然决定在印尼建立军事基地
    新华社讯　雅加达消息：美帝国主义利用印度尼西亚苏哈托—纳苏蒂安卖国集团为它敞开的门户，正在军事和经济上加紧控制印尼。
    据报道，由于苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权出卖印尼人民的主权，美帝国主义公然决定在印尼的芝拉札等几个地方建立军事基地。雅加达报纸最近透露，美国政府官员正在研究印尼各战略港口，美国驻印尼大使格林和武官最近曾到中爪哇和苏门答腊的一些港口进行阴谋活动。今年一月十五日，美国和印尼反动当局还签署了一项空运协定，根据这个协定，美国飞机可以自由地在雅加达和巴厘等地着陆。另据美国官方刊物《外交政策概要》四月间透露，美国政府打算“继续向印尼陆军提供军事援助”。
    为了扶植处于空前困境的苏哈托—纳苏蒂安右派军人政权，美帝国主义几个月来接连不断地向这个集团提供“贷款”和“援助”。据雅加达《希望之光报》五月二十九日报道，继今年二月美国向印尼提供六千万美元“贷款”之后，最近又答应向它提供一亿四千万美元“援助”，用来购买美国的大米、面粉等。消息说，美国在今年内向印尼法西斯军人政权提供的“援助”总数将达二亿五千万美元。
    据美国《外交政策概要》早些时候透露，美国政府已经答应延长印尼欠它的大量美元债务的期限。
    美帝国主义的这些行径，完全是为了进一步控制印尼，加紧在东南亚推行侵略政策。美帝头子约翰逊今年二月八日在谈到美国一九六八年“援外咨文”时供认，向印尼法西斯军人政权提供“贷款”和“援助”，“完全符合我们的利益”。
