The glorious image of the great communist warrior Meng He, who was infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and to the people, is forever etched in the minds of the soldiers of the Fifth Company of the unit where Meng He served before his death. It inspires them to march forward to victory.

Last December 25 in the afternoon, the comrades of the Fifth Company, like they always do, went to the fields to burn ash fertilizer and actively prepared for spring farming. As it grew dark, the sentry suddenly noticed thick smoke rising from a threshing floor in Ba Cang Farm.

"Fire! The haystack is on fire!"

The soldiers clearly knew that on this very threshing floor, there were over 600,000 catties of green barley. Everyone immediately realized: this was sabotage by class enemies. "Fire is the order! Charge forward!" The soldiers of the Fifth Company, armed with whatever tools they had at hand, rushed towards the fire...

"Learn from Comrade Meng He, charge towards the flames!"

This call became the battle cry for the soldiers of the Fifth Company and the revolutionary masses around them to extinguish the raging fire.

Third Platoon Leader Li Zhijun, with an overwhelming heroic spirit, was the first to run towards the burning haystack and climb up. Halfway up, he fell down with the hay bundles. Li Zhijun did not make a sound; he leaned on the human ladder formed by his comrades and was the first to climb up the "volcano." The other comrades followed suit.

The haystack was filled with thick smoke and dancing flames.

The heroes of the company, where the fire was the fiercest, charged towards it; where it was most dangerous, they went. Great Mao Zedong Thought guided the soldiers in their battle against the flames. Five Good Soldier Jing Qingyun's eyebrows were singed, his clothes were on fire, and his skin was burned. But thinking of Comrade Meng He's lofty image of using his blood and life to protect his class brothers, he had only one thought: "I want to be like Comrade Meng He, the political instructor, and rescue state property. Live to fight for Chairman Mao, die to dedicate to Chairman Mao!" He continued to battle the flames. He shouted to his comrades around him: "Don't mind me, put out the fire!"

Under the heroic efforts of all the soldiers of the Fifth Company and the revolutionary masses nearby, the fire was extinguished, the barley was saved, and the evil plot of the class enemies was foiled. Every time this incident is mentioned, the revolutionary masses of Ba Cang Farm unanimously praise: "The soldiers of the Fifth Company have learned from Meng He the best, each one is like Meng He, infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to the people!"

    门合的光辉形象鼓舞他们战斗
    伟大的共产主义战士门合同志无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于人民的光辉形象，永远刻在门合生前所在某部五连战士们的脑子里，鼓舞着他们胜利向前。
    去年十二月二十五日下午，五连的同志和往常一样，又来到地里烧灰肥，积极进行备耕生产。天快黑时，哨兵突然发现巴仓农场的一个打麦场上升起了滚滚浓烟。
      “火！麦垛着火了！”
    战士们清楚地知道，就在这个打麦场上，放置着六十多万斤青稞。大家立即意识到：这是阶级敌人在搞破坏。“火光就是命令！冲上去！”五连的战士们拿着随手使用的工具，迅速冲向火场……
      “向门合同志学习，迎着烈火扑上去！”
    这声音，成了召唤五连战士和周围革命群众扑灭熊熊烈火的战斗号令。
    三排长李志俊以压倒一切的英雄气概，首先跑向起火的麦垛，向上面爬去。爬到半腰，就和麦捆一块掉了下来。李志俊没哼一声，又扶着战士们搭成的人梯，第一个爬上了
  “火山”，其他同志也都跟了上去。
    麦垛上浓烟滚滚，火苗乱窜。
    英雄连队的同志，那里火最大，他们就往那里冲；那里最危险，他们就到那里去。伟大的毛泽东思想指挥着战士们与烈火搏斗。五好战士景庆云眉毛烧焦了，衣服烧着了，皮肤烧伤了。但他想到门合同志用鲜血和生命保卫阶级兄弟的高大形象，心里只有一个念头：“我要象门合指导员那样，抢救国家财产。生为毛主席战斗，死为毛主席献身！”他继续与烈火搏斗。他向周围的同志喊道：“不要管我，救火要紧！”
    在五连全体同志和附近革命群众的英勇战斗下，大火被扑灭了，青稞保住了，阶级敌人的罪恶阴谋破产了。每当谈到这件事，巴仓农场的革命群众都一致赞扬说：“五连的同志学门合学得最好，个个都象门合一样，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于人民！”    本报通讯员
