		Maintain Close Ties with the Masses, Forever Preserve the Character of the Working People
		Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee Vice Chairman, Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Mass Organization Coordinator Wan Li Lang

		Comrade Men He is a shining example of a cadre who continues the revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, a great model of a communist warrior. As an ordinary worker, a leader of a revolutionary mass organization, and a "new recruit" in the proletarian revolutionary power, I must especially learn from Comrade Men He's excellent style of maintaining close ties with the masses, never detach from the masses, and always preserve the hardworking and simple character of the working people. I will take Comrade Men He as my example and strive to achieve the following: even if my position changes, the character of the working class cannot change, the style of maintaining close ties with the masses cannot change, the tradition of hard work and simplicity cannot change, the attitude of humility and caution cannot change, and the revolutionary spirit and fighting style cannot change.

		Learning from Comrade Men He to maintain close ties with the masses and always preserve the hardworking and simple character of the working people is a major issue in preventing revisionism and preventing changes, a big issue related to the new revolutionary committee never changing color, and a fundamental issue related to the transformation of our worldview as members of the revolutionary committee. Is it to be like Comrade Men He, who is "selfless and dedicated to others," or to be selfish and self-centered? Is it to be like Comrade Men He, who maintains close ties with the masses, humbly learns from the masses, and serves the people, or to stand above the masses, act like an official, and be a lord? Is it to be like Comrade Men He, who always preserves the hardworking and simple character of the working people, or to be a captive of the bourgeois "sugar-coated bullets"? Is it to be like Comrade Men He, who stands firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line for twenty years, continuously revolutionizes, and continuously advances, or to fear difficulties and hard work, be arrogant, stop progressing, and live off past merits? This is the fundamental difference between the proletarian worldview and the bourgeois worldview.

		Learning from the hero, finding the gap, I feel that there is still a big gap between me and Comrade Men He. I am the son of the working class and poor peasants, growing up in the soil of the masses and under the sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought. I will walk the path that Comrade Men He has walked, humbly serve the people, be a student of the masses, and forever root myself among the masses, wholeheartedly serving the people. I will be like Comrade Men He: "Serve the people as a cow for a lifetime, pull the revolutionary cart for a lifetime."

		The reason why Comrade Men He can maintain close ties with the masses and always be heart-to-heart with the masses is, above all, that he has an unyielding loyalty to Chairman Mao, eagerly studies Chairman Mao's works, and insists on the excellent learning style of learning and applying in practice. I will take Comrade Men He as my example, and more diligently study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's latest instructions, study every day, use them at all times, study wherever I go, truly achieving: "Study Chairman Mao's instructions, diligently and seriously; propagate Chairman Mao's instructions, without stopping for a moment; execute Chairman Mao's instructions, thoroughly and completely; defend Chairman Mao's instructions, firmly and unyieldingly."

    密切联系群众，永远保持劳动人民的本色
    江西省革命委员会副主任、江西省大联筹负责人　万里浪
    门合同志是在无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的党的干部的光辉榜样，是共产主义战士的伟大典型。我作为一个普通的工人，革命群众组织的负责人，无产阶级革命政权中的一员“新兵”，要特别学习门合同志密切联系群众的优良作风，永远不脱离群众，始终保持劳动人民艰苦朴素的本色。我要以门合同志为榜样，决心做到：地位变了，工人阶级的本色不能变，密切联系群众的作风不能变，艰苦朴素的传统不能变，谦虚谨慎的态度不能变，革命的朝气和战斗的风格不能变。
    学习门合同志密切联系群众，始终保持劳动人民艰苦朴素的本色，这是防修防变的重大问题，是关系到新生的革委会永不变色的大问题，也是关系到我们每个革委会成员世界观改造的根本问题。是象门合同志那样“毫不利己专门利人”，还是一切为自己，为个人？是象门合同志那样密切联系群众，甘当群众的小学生，做人民的勤务员，还是凌驾于群众之上，做官当老爷？是象门合同志那样始终保持劳动人民艰苦朴素的本色，还是做资产阶级“糖衣炮弹”的俘虏？是象门合同志那样，二十年如一日，坚定地站在毛主席革命路线一边，不断革命，不断前进，还是畏难怕累，居功自傲，停滞不前，靠老本吃饭？这是无产阶级世界观和资产阶级世界观的根本区别。
    学英雄，找差距，我感到自己和门合同志还有很大的距离。我是工人阶级和贫下中农的儿子，是在群众的土壤中，在毛泽东思想的阳光照耀下成长的。我要走门合同志走过的道路，恭恭敬敬地做人民的勤务员，做群众的小学生，永远扎根于群众之中，全心全意为人民服务。要象门合同志那样：“当一辈子人民的牛，拉一辈子革命的车”。
    门合同志所以能密切联系群众，永远和群众心连心，最根本的一条，就是他怀着无限忠于毛主席的赤胆忠心，如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作，坚持活学活用、学用结合的优良学风。我要以门合同志为榜样，更加努力地活学活用毛泽东思想，活学活用毛主席的一系列最新指示，天天学，时时用，走到哪学到哪，真正做到：“学习毛主席指示，刻苦认真，宣传毛主席指示，分秒不停，执行毛主席指示，完全彻底，捍卫毛主席指示，坚定不移。”
