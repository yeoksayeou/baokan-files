Violent suppression cannot intimidate the brave fighters; sweet words cannot deceive the awakened people
The French people say: The struggle must continue!
Masses filled with revolutionary enthusiasm take to the streets again; workers and students wave red flags and sing the "Internationale" side by side in battle
The French revisionists and labor traitors, in collusion with the ruling class, are hatching plots of division and deception, attempting to extinguish the flames of the workers' strike struggle

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on June 2nd: Paris news: The revolutionary workers and students in France are undeterred by the threats of violent suppression from the reactionaries and are not deceived by the sweet talk of traitors and labor scabs. They continue to fight with high spirits. Workers and students in Paris and other French cities took to the streets on June 1st for a massive demonstration. They are filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, shouting, "The struggle must continue!"

Thousands of Parisian students gathered in the square in front of the Montparnasse train station in the afternoon, holding a rally to express strong protests against the French ruling class. Despite the opposition from the French revisionist-controlled General Confederation of Labor, a large number of Parisian workers joined the students' demonstration. After the rally, students and workers waved red flags, sang the "Internationale," and marched along the left bank of the Seine River. A huge banner in the marching crowd read, "The struggle continues." The demonstrators shouted slogans along the way: "Power to the workers," "No to fascism," "Down with the dictatorship," "Elections are betrayal."

The students distributed leaflets along the way, pointing out that the "legislative elections" the French government is preparing to hold at the end of June is a "trap" to sabotage the strike movement. The leaflets also exposed that some people are currently trying to lure workers and students back to work and school. The leaflets called on workers and students to continue the fight, "until the ultimate goal is achieved: Power to the workers."

After the march, several thousand Parisian students, despite police obstruction, went to the Citroën and Renault car factories in the Paris suburbs to support the workers who are still on strike in these two factories.

On the same day, workers and students in many other French cities also held large-scale demonstrations. In Clermont-Ferrand, more than eighteen thousand workers and students demonstrated in front of the prefecture. When the police attacked the crowd with tear gas, the demonstrators built barricades and fought bravely with the police. In the port of Brest, more than five thousand workers and students held a demonstration march. Large-scale mass demonstrations were also held in Limoges, Saint-Brieuc, and other places.

Faced with the brave struggle of revolutionary workers and students, the French ruling class is resorting to all kinds of threats and inducements in an attempt to sabotage the French workers' strike. While stepping up the deployment of troops to threaten the revolutionary masses, the French authorities continue to dispatch police to brutally drive away the picket lines of striking workers at radio stations, post offices, and railways, plotting to first sabotage the strikes in these departments. On the other hand, after holding the first meeting of the new cabinet, the French government issued a so-called "decree" to raise the minimum wages of workers and agricultural workers and urged the French yellow unions to hasten the lure of workers back to work.

The French revisionist group and some yellow union leaders, who have always acted as henchmen for the French monopolistic bourgeoisie, have once again come out to run errands for the French ruling class. They shamelessly announced that they have reached an "agreement" with the government on the resumption of work in the gas, electricity, Paris metro, and bus departments. At the same time, they are playing various tricks of deception and division to try to extinguish the flames of the workers' strike struggle.

The actions of the French revisionist group and the yellow union leaders have, from the opposite side, educated the French people, making more and more French workers and students recognize their traitorous and labor scab nature. Some members and cadres of the French revisionists have also rebelled, publicly exposing the crimes of the French revisionists in betraying the people and opposing the revolution. This situation has forced Western news agencies to admit that the "French youth rebellion has exposed the naked truth about the country's leadership, from Gaullists to various political figures of different colors in the Communist Party (referring to the French revisionists)."

On June 1st, French students held a demonstration march in Paris, calling for workers, students, and teachers to unite and launch a mass counterattack against the French ruling class.

### 法国人民说：斗争必须继续下去！

    暴力镇压吓不倒英勇的战士　甜言蜜语骗不了觉醒的人民
    法国人民说：斗争必须继续下去！
    广大群众满怀革命豪情再次示威，工人学生挥舞红旗高唱《国际歌》并肩战斗法修工贼配合统治集团大搞分化和欺骗阴谋，力图扑灭工人罢工斗争的烈火
    据新华社二日讯　巴黎消息：法国革命的工人和学生不怕反动派暴力镇压的威胁，不受叛徒、工贼甜言蜜语的欺骗，继续斗志昂扬地坚持斗争。巴黎和其他法国城市的工人和学生，一日再次走上街头，举行声势浩大的示威。他们满怀革命的豪情，高呼“斗争必须继续下去”。
    成千上万的巴黎学生一日下午四时，浩浩荡荡地涌进蒙帕纳斯车站前的广场举行集会，对法国统治集团表示强烈的抗议。大批巴黎工人，不顾法修控制的总工会的反对，参加了学生组织的这次示威行动。会后，学生和工人挥舞着红旗，高唱《国际歌》，在塞纳河左岸游行。游行队伍的巨大横幅上写着：“斗争在继续”。示威者沿途高呼口号：“权力归于工人”，“不许搞法西斯主义”，“打倒独裁”，“选举就是背叛”。
    学生们沿途散发传单，指出法国政府准备在六月底组织的“立法选举”是破坏罢工运动的“一个圈套”。传单还揭露，目前有人正在诱骗工人和学生复工复课。传单号召工人和学生继续战斗下去，“直到实现最后的目标：权力归于工人”。
    游行结束后，几千名巴黎学生不顾警察的阻挠，来到巴黎郊区的雪铁龙汽车制造厂和雷诺汽车制造厂，声援仍在坚持罢工的这两个厂的工人。
    同一天，在法国其他许多城市，工人和学生也举行了大规模的示威。在克莱芒—费朗，一万八千多名工人和学生在省政府前举行示威。当警察使用催泪弹袭击群众时，示威者筑起街垒，同警察进行英勇搏斗。在布雷斯特港，五千多名工人和学生举行了示威游行。在里摩日、圣布里厄等地也举行了大规模的群众示威。
    面对革命工人和学生的英勇斗争，法国统治集团正在极尽威胁利诱之能事，千方百计地企图破坏法国工人的罢工。在加紧调兵遣将威胁革命群众的同时，法国当局继续出动警察蛮横地赶走在电台、邮局和铁路上的罢工工人纠察队，阴谋首先破坏这些部门的罢工。另一方面，法国政府在举行了新内阁的第一次会议后，抛出了所谓提高工人和农业工人最低工资的“法令”，并催促法国各黄色工会加紧诱骗工人复工。
    一贯充当法国垄断资产阶级帮凶的法修集团和一些黄色工会头目，又一次跳出来为法国统治集团奔走效劳，他们无耻地宣布已就煤气、电力、巴黎的地下铁道和公共汽车等部门的复工问题同政府达成“协议”。与此同时，他们玩弄各种欺骗和分化工人的阴谋诡计，力图扑灭工人罢工斗争的烈火。
    法国修正主义集团和黄色工会头目的所作所为，从反面教育了法国人民，使得越来越多的法国工人和学生，认清了他们的叛徒和工贼的丑恶本质。法修的一些党员和干部也起来造反，公开揭露法修出卖人民反对革命的罪行。这种情况使得西方通讯社也不得不承认，法国“青年起来造反赤裸裸地暴露了这个国家的领导阶层，从戴高乐派一直到共产党（指法修）的各种政治色彩的人物”。（附图片）
