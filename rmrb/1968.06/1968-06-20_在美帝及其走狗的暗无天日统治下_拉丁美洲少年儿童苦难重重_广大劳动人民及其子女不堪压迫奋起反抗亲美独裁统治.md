Under the brutal plunder and evil rule of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, the broad masses of laboring people in Latin America are becoming increasingly impoverished. Their children are struggling on the brink of hunger, disease, and death, which further fuels the strong resistance of the Latin American people.

In recent years, U.S. imperialism has intensified its economic aggression against Latin America, leading to currency devaluation, soaring prices, rising foreign debts, and increased unemployment. The living conditions of the Latin American laboring masses are deteriorating, and they are unable to support their children. The child mortality rate is alarmingly high. According to reports, half of the children in Costa Rica do not live to see their fifth birthday. In El Salvador, 80% of children die before reaching the age of five. In northeastern Brazil, out of every 1,000 newborns, 176 die. Starving peasants are forced to eat rats to survive. Recent news from Ecuador reports that children in some disaster-stricken rural areas are swallowing grass and dirt, and many are starving to death.

Many children of the Latin American laboring people are born malnourished, weak, and sickly, and they do not receive even the most basic medical treatment. According to reports, under the rule of the pro-U.S. dictatorship in Brazil, 2.5 million children suffer from chronic illnesses. In Peru, 300,000 children suffer from nervous disorders, and 10% of them are incurable.

In Latin America, oppressed by U.S. imperialism and the ruling class, both rural and urban areas are filled with countless homeless children. Desperate laboring people are forced to sell their own children. Statistics show that 80% of school-age children in Latin America cannot attend primary school. A small number of children who manage to enroll in school are forced to drop out due to financial hardships and the inability to pay high tuition fees.

Due to the harsh living conditions, many young children in Latin America are forced to work alongside their parents in enterprises and plantations owned by imperialists and local landlords and capitalists, enduring inhuman exploitation and oppression. In Central America, under the strict control of U.S. imperialism, more than 50% of children, especially those aged 6 to 13, are forced to perform heavy labor like beasts of burden. In the Amazon region of Brazil, 80% of the port loading and unloading work is done by impoverished child laborers.

The brutal oppression by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys has ignited the hatred and resistance of the broad masses of laboring people and their children in Latin America. Recently, the children of sugar workers in Tucumán Province, Argentina, bravely participated in demonstrations and marches against exploitation and hunger, angrily protesting the reactionary policies of the pro-U.S. dictatorship. The oppressed and exploited youth and their elders in Latin America are increasingly recognizing that only by rising up and fighting, through revolutionary actions to overthrow the rule of imperialism and the ruling class, can they change their miserable fate and win freedom and liberation.

    在美帝及其走狗的暗无天日统治下
    拉丁美洲少年儿童苦难重重
    广大劳动人民及其子女不堪压迫奋起反抗亲美独裁统治
    新华社讯　在美帝国主义及其走狗的残暴掠夺和罪恶统治下，拉丁美洲广大劳动人民日益贫困，他们的子女在饥饿、疾病和死亡线上挣扎，这更加激起了拉美人民的强烈反抗。
    近年来，美帝国主义加紧对拉丁美洲进行经济侵略，造成拉丁美洲各国货币贬值、物价飞涨、外债上升、失业增加。拉美劳动人民的生活日益恶化，他们养不活自己的子女，儿童死亡率高得惊人。据报道，哥斯达黎加有一半儿童活不到五岁。在萨尔瓦多，五岁以下就死亡的儿童竟高达百分之八十。在巴西东北部，每一千个新出生的孩子，就有一百七十六个死亡。饥饿的农民捕食老鼠充饥。最近来自厄瓜多尔的消息说，一些受灾农村的儿童吞咽草根泥土，大批活活饿死。
    拉丁美洲劳动人民的孩子，有许多都是先天不足，营养不良，体弱多病，而且得不到最起码的医药治疗。据报道，在亲美独裁政权统治下的巴西，有二百五十万儿童患慢性病。在秘鲁，有三十万儿童患神经官能症，其中百分之十无法治疗。
    被美帝国主义和寡头势力压榨得贫苦不堪的拉丁美洲，从农村到城市，到处都有许许多多流浪儿童。无法生存的劳动人民被迫出卖亲生儿女。据统计，拉丁美洲百分之八十的学龄儿童上不了小学，小部分好容易进了学校的儿童，其中三分之二由于生活所迫，交纳不起高昂的学杂费，不得不中途纷纷辍学。
    拉丁美洲劳动人民的子女，由于无法生活，许多小小年纪的儿童不得不跟父兄一起，在帝国主义和本国大地主大资产阶级的企业和庄园里出卖劳力，饱受非人的奴役和剥削。在美帝国主义严密控制下的中美洲，百分之五十以上的儿童，特别是六岁到十三岁的儿童，被迫象牛马一样担负沉重的劳动。巴西亚马孙河百分之八十的航运装卸业务，压在贫苦童工的肩上。
    美帝国主义及其走狗的残酷压迫，激发了拉美广大劳动人民及其子女的仇恨和反抗。不久以前，阿根廷图库曼省糖业工人的子女勇敢地参加反剥削、反饥饿的示威游行和进军，愤怒抗议亲美独裁政权的反动政策。拉丁美洲被压迫、被剥削的青少年和他们的长辈一起，越来越认识到：只有奋起斗争，用革命行动推翻帝国主义和寡头势力的统治，才能改变他们的悲惨命运，赢得自由和解放。
