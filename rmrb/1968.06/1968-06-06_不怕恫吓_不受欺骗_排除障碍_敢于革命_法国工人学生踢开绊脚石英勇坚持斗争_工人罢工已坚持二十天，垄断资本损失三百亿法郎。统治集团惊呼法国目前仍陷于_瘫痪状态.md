June 6, 1968, 5th Edition

Paris, June 5 (Xinhua) — The nationwide strike by French workers, which has shaken the capitalist world, continues to overcome numerous obstacles and advance. French students, with unyielding heroism, are also fiercely persisting in their struggle. French Prime Minister Georges Pompidou, in a fit of rage, exclaimed that France is still in a state of "paralysis."

Since May 17, a political and economic strike has swept across France. By June 5, it had lasted for twenty days. Over the past three weeks, the French ruling class has used every means of force, threats, deception, and bribery against the striking workers. The French revisionist clique and various traitors and scabs have repeatedly betrayed the interests of the working class, reaching "agreements" with the government and capitalists to resume work, doing everything they can to sabotage the workers' just struggle. However, the French workers, with the revolutionary tradition of the Paris Commune, are not afraid of threats and are not deceived. They have set aside the leaders of the yellow unions and bravely persisted in their struggle. Currently, except for a few departments and small enterprises, the vast majority of workers in France's railways, aviation, postal services, metallurgy, chemicals, automobile manufacturing, aircraft manufacturing, and other major factories and enterprises are still occupying the factories and continuing the strike. France's national economic life remains paralyzed.

On June 4, 22,000 workers at France's largest automobile monopoly, the state-owned Renault Automobile Company, held a meeting at the Billancourt factory in the Paris suburbs and unanimously decided to continue the strike. Workers at another automobile monopoly, the privately-owned Citroën Automobile Manufacturing Plant, also decided to continue the strike.

At France's largest aircraft manufacturing enterprise, Sud Aviation, the French authorities sent police to forcefully evict the workers occupying the factory, provoking widespread indignation among the workers. The workers of this company angrily condemned this outrage and decided to strengthen their strike. Additionally, workers at three engine factories also decided to continue the strike.

The French ruling class is anxious about the long-term paralysis of the national railway system. In recent days, they have reached a "resumption of work agreement" with the leaders of the yellow unions in the railway system on one hand, and on the other, sent police to drive out the workers' picket lines from several important stations and bribed a few people to run a few trains, immediately boasting about the "resumption of railway operations." However, the railway workers have foiled the government's plans. They once again trampled on the yellow union leaders' "resumption of work agreement" and reoccupied many important stations, preventing the trains from running.

At France's largest international airport, Orly Airport, after the union leaders reached an "agreement" with the government, they ordered the workers to resume work. However, a large number of workers did not listen to them and continued the strike. Workers at Air France in Paris Orly Airport, Marseille Airport, and Toulouse Airport also announced their opposition to resuming work.

Despite the French government sending a large number of police to forcibly occupy the Paris headquarters and transmission stations of French Radio and Television, they have not been able to fully restart the government's propaganda machine. This outrage by the French government has been condemned by the radio station employees and reporters, who have decided to continue their strike struggle.

The broad masses of workers in the Paris Metro and public buses have also rejected the "resumption of work agreement" reached by the yellow union leaders with the government. The capitalists of the two largest department stores in Paris, despite reaching an agreement with the yellow unions and announcing the resumption of business on June 4, found that the workers occupying the two department stores posted a notice on the door: "We are not open for business today — we continue the fight."

Meanwhile, French students continue to occupy eighteen universities and many high schools in France, bravely persisting in their struggle. In the Paris University campus, red flags flutter in the wind, and students and young workers discuss various issues in the student movement and workers' movement day and night, enthusiastically exploring the correct revolutionary path. They also take care of fellow students injured by reactionary military police in the school and print a large number of propaganda materials to distribute to the masses. Many students also go out of the school gates to support the workers' struggle.

Inspired by the unprecedented surge in the student movement in France, students in France's colony in Latin America, Guadeloupe, also bravely rebelled. They occupied the building of the French Overseas Department of Immigration and wrote red slogans on the wall: "Down with French imperialism!" "Liberate the Antilles!"

The struggle of French workers and students has severely shaken the rule of the French monopolistic bourgeoisie, dealing a heavy blow to the French ruling class. French Prime Minister Georges Pompidou exclaimed on June 3: Three weeks of the general strike have caused French capitalists to lose 6% of their annual production, equivalent to 30 billion francs. He lamented that France is still in a state of "paralysis" and called for "resuming work as quickly and on as large a scale as possible."

Under the impact of the general strike, France's gold and foreign exchange reserves decreased by 1.514 billion francs (equivalent to $306.6 million) in May. The French government had to withdraw $74.5 million from the International Monetary Fund on June 4 to support the faltering French franc.

The heroic struggle of the French working class and students is greatly inspiring the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries in the world. Although the road ahead will have twists and turns and difficulties, the just struggle of the French people will surely achieve final victory.

    不怕恫吓  不受欺骗  排除障碍  敢于革命
    法国工人学生踢开绊脚石英勇坚持斗争
    工人罢工已坚持二十天，垄断资本损失三百亿法郎。统治集团惊呼法国目前仍陷于“瘫痪状态”
    新华社五日讯　巴黎消息：震撼资本主义世界的法国工人的全国总罢工，继续排除重重障碍，不断地向前发展。法国学生也以不畏强暴的英雄气概，斗志昂扬地坚持斗争。法国总理蓬皮杜气急败坏地惊呼，法国仍然陷于“瘫痪状态”。
    从五月十七日起席卷全法国的工人政治、经济大罢工，到六月五日已坚持了二十天。三个星期以来，法国统治集团对罢工工人极尽武力威胁、欺骗收买之能事，法国修正主义集团和法国形形色色的叛徒、工贼一再背叛工人阶级的利益，同政府和资本家达成复工“协议”，不遗余力地破坏工人的正义斗争。但是，具有巴黎公社革命传统的法国工人，不怕恫吓，不受欺骗，把黄色工会的头目撇在一边，英勇地坚持斗争。目前，除了个别部门和一些小型企业以外，法国的铁路、航空、邮电、冶金、化学、汽车制造、飞机制造、以及其他主要的工厂企业中的绝大多数的工人，仍在继续占领工厂，坚持罢工。法国全国的经济生活继续陷于瘫痪状态。
    法国最大的汽车垄断企业——国营雷诺汽车公司的二万二千名工人，四日在巴黎郊区的比扬古工厂举行会议，一致决定坚持罢工。另一个汽车垄断企业——私营雪铁龙汽车制造厂的工人，也决定继续罢工。
    在法国最大的飞机制造企业——南方飞机公司，法国当局派遣警察蛮横无理地驱逐占领工厂的工人，激起广大工人的义愤。这个公司的工人们愤怒地谴责这一暴行，并决定加强他们的罢工斗争。此外，三家飞机引擎工厂的工人，也决定继续罢工。
    法国统治集团对于全国铁道系统长期瘫痪的状态惊慌不安。这几天，它一方面同铁路系统的黄色工会头目达成复工“协议”，另一方面派遣警察把工人的罢工纠察队赶出一些重要的车站，并且收买少数人开出几辆火车，随即迫不及待地宣传铁路“开始复工”。可是，铁路工人们打乱了政府的如意算盘。他们又一次把黄色工会头目的复工“协议”踩在脚下，重新占领了许多重要的车站，使火车开不出去。
    在法国最大的国际机场——奥利机场，工会头目同政府达成“协议”后，下令工人复工。可是大批工人不听他们那一套，继续罢工。法国航空公司在巴黎奥利机场、马赛机场和图卢兹机场的职工，也宣布反对复工。
    尽管法国政府派出大批警察强行占领了法国广播电视台的巴黎总台和在巴黎附近的发射台，但并没有能够使法国政府的这个宣传机器完全开动起来。法国政府的这一暴行受到电台职工和记者们的谴责，他们决定坚持罢工斗争。
    巴黎地下铁道和公共汽车的广大职工也否决了黄色工会头目同政府达成的复工“协议”。巴黎两家最大的百货公司的资本家尽管同黄色工会达成“协议”，宣布四日恢复营业；但是，占领了这两家百货公司的职工四日针锋相对地在门前贴出通告：“我们今天不营业——继续进行战斗。”
    与此同时，法国学生继续占领着法国的十八所大学和许多中学，英勇地坚持斗争。在巴黎大学校园里，红旗迎风招展，学生们和青年工人日以继夜地讨论着学生运动、工人运动中的各种问题，热情地探讨正确的革命道路。他们还在学校里看护被反动军警打伤的同学，并且编印出大量的宣传品向群众散发。许多学生还走出校门，到工厂去支援工人的斗争。
    在法国空前高涨的学生运动的鼓舞下，法国在拉丁美洲的殖民地——瓜德罗普的学生也勇敢地起来造反。他们占领了法国海外省移民局的大楼，在墙上刷出红色的标语：“打倒法帝国主义！”“解放安的列斯群岛！”
    法国工人和学生的斗争猛烈地震撼着法国垄断资产阶级的统治，给了法国统治集团以沉重的打击。法国总理蓬皮杜三日惊呼：三个星期的总罢工已使法国资本家损失了全年生产总额的百分之六，相当于三百亿法郎。他哀叹法国目前仍然陷于“瘫痪状态”，并叫嚷必须“尽快地、尽可能大规模地复工”。
    在总罢工的冲击下，法国的黄金外汇储备在五月份已减少了十五亿一千四百万法郎（相当于三亿零六百六十万美元）。法国政府四日不得不从国际货币基金组织提取了七亿四千五百万美元，来支撑摇摇欲坠的法国法郎。
    法国工人阶级和学生的英勇斗争，正在巨大地鼓舞着世界各国人民的革命斗争。尽管前进的道路上会有曲折和困难，但是法国人民的正义斗争，一定会取得最后的胜利。（附图片）
