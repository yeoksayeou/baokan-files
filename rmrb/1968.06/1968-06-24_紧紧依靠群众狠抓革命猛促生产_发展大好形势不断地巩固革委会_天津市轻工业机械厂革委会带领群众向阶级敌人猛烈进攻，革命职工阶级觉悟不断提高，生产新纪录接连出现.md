The revolutionary committee of the Tianjin Light Industry Machinery Factory, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching that "the most fundamental principle in reforming state organs is to link up with the masses," closely relies on the masses, leads the masses in carrying out the revolution and production, develops the excellent situation, and consolidates the newly established revolutionary committee.

This factory produces papermaking machinery equipment. After the factory revolutionary committee was established in February this year, a handful of class enemies, unwilling to perish, used more covert methods to incite anarchist tendencies and undermine the authority of the revolutionary committee. As soon as the activities of the class enemies were exposed, the revolutionary masses saw through them. The revolutionary committee, relying closely on the masses, mobilized the masses to expose the evil plots of the class enemies. At that time, someone in the milling and planing small group of the machine shop blew a cold wind, stirring up trouble between the masses and the revolutionary committee. Members of the revolutionary committee and the PLA leftist support personnel went deep into this small group, had heart-to-heart talks with veteran workers, and held Mao Zedong Thought study classes with the masses. They used Chairman Mao's class and class struggle viewpoint and proletarian revolutionary line to educate and mobilize the masses, exposing the new characteristics and trends of class struggle, further lifting the lid on class struggle. It turned out that this cold wind was stirred up by a scoundrel who had always sabotaged the revolution and production. The workers first exposed him, and the entire factory launched a fierce attack on the class enemies, leaving them no place to hide. Under this excellent situation, the revolutionary committee seized the opportunity to raise the class struggle consciousness of the masses and launch a fierce attack on the class enemies.

After exposing the class enemies, the broad revolutionary masses felt invigorated and eagerly demanded to launch a revolutionary big criticism. At this time, the latest instructions from the great leader Chairman Mao came: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all other exploiting classes in the condition of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its led broad revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Members of the revolutionary committee repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and found that the masses' demands were correct. Therefore, the revolutionary committee mobilized the masses to launch a revolutionary big criticism throughout the factory. The workers studied Chairman Mao's teachings, saw how China's Khrushchev poisoned the people, exposed how the capitalist-roaders within the party and class enemies implemented the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods, and combined the actual class struggle of their factory. Everyone participated in the criticism. They combined the visible and tangible class struggle facts of their factory, carried out revolutionary big criticism, and criticized it thoroughly and forcefully, with good results.

The excellent revolutionary situation throughout the factory aroused the socialist labor enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary workers. In March, the main papermaking equipment, the steam ball, produced by the entire factory exceeded the highest monthly production level of 1966 by 20%; although in April, due to the struggle against the enemy and the holding of the factory-wide revolutionary big criticism, six days were taken up, the production of steam balls still increased by 30% compared to March, creating the highest record since the factory was established. Under this unprecedented excellent situation, can we still advance? Members of the revolutionary committee followed Chairman Mao's teaching that "people's thoughts must adapt to the already changed situation" and, when formulating the production plan for May, went deep into various production teams to discuss the situation with the workers, propose measures, tap potential, and make plans. The workers said, "Can we produce more steam balls or not? This directly relates to the increased production of paper for Chairman Mao's works, which is a top priority for promoting Mao Zedong Thought. Producing one more steam ball a day earlier means five more tons of paper can be produced a day, and more of Chairman Mao's works can be published." The entire factory planned to produce 13 steam balls in May, but actually completed 15, creating the best production record.

    天津市轻工业机械厂革委会带领群众向阶级敌人猛烈进攻，革命职工阶级觉悟不断提高，生产新纪录接连出现
    据新华社天津二十三日电　天津市轻工业机械厂革命委员会，遵循伟大领袖毛主席关于“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众”的教导，紧紧依靠群众，带领群众搞好革命和生产，发展大好形势，巩固新生的革命委员会。
    这个厂是生产造纸机械设备的。今年二月份，工厂革命委员会建立以后，一小撮阶级敌人不甘心于灭亡，用更隐蔽的手法，煽动无政府主义思潮，破坏革委会的威信。阶级敌人的活动一露头，革命群众就识破了。革委会紧紧依靠群众，放手发动群众，揭露阶级敌人的罪恶阴谋。当时，金工车间铣刨小组有人吹出了一股阴风，挑拨群众与革委会的关系。革委会成员和解放军支左人员深入到这个小组，找老工人谈心，同群众一起办毛泽东思想学习班，用毛主席的阶级和阶级斗争观点，用毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，教育群众，发动群众，大摆阶级斗争的新特点、新动向，进一步揭开阶级斗争的盖子。原来，这股妖风是一个一贯破坏革命和生产的坏家伙煽起来的，工人们首先揭露了他，全厂立刻向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，使阶级敌人无处躲藏。在这大好形势下，革委会又因势利导，提高群众的阶级斗争觉悟，进一步向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻。
    揪出了阶级敌人，广大革命群众扬眉吐气，纷纷要求开展革命大批判。这时正好传来了伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”革委会成员反复学习了毛主席的最新指示，越想群众的要求越正确。于是，革委会深入发动群众，在全厂掀起了革命大批判的高潮。工人们学习毛主席的教导，看中国赫鲁晓夫是怎样放毒的，揭露党内走资派和阶级敌人是怎样贯彻反革命修正主义黑货的，结合本厂阶级斗争实际和特点，人人起来揭发，个个参加批判。他们结合本厂看得见、摸得着的阶级斗争事实，开展革命大批判，批判得扎实、有力，效果很好。
    全厂的大好革命形势，调动了广大革命职工的社会主义劳动积极性。三月份，全厂生产的主要造纸设备蒸球，超过了一九六六年最高月产水平百分之二十；四月份虽然因为开展对敌斗争和举行全厂性的革命大批判，占用了六天时间，蒸球的产量仍然比三月份提高百分之三十，接连创造了建厂以来的最高纪录。在这一片空前大好形势下，还能不能再前进？革委会成员遵循毛主席关于“人们的思想必须适应已经变化了的情况”的教导，在制订五月份生产计划的时候，深入到各生产班组去，同工人一起谈形势，提措施，挖潜力，订计划。工人们说，我们能不能多生产蒸球，直接关系到毛主席著作用纸的增产，是关系到宣传毛泽东思想的头等大事。早一天生产一台蒸球，一天就能多生产五吨纸，就能多出版毛主席著作。五月份全厂计划生产十三台蒸球，结果完成了十五台，又创造了最好的生产成绩。
