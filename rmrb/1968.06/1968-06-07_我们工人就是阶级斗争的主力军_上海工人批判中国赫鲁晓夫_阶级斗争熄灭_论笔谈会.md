In the great struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, we workers must stand at the forefront of the battle. Comrade Zhang Wen, a driver from the Shanghai Automobile Transport Company's 901 Team, said:

We Must Continuously Raise Our Awareness of Line Struggle

China's Khrushchev says, "The enemies have been almost eliminated," "The counter-revolutionaries have been almost resolved," "The two characters of class are worth considering." Bah! This is sheer nonsense! I was so angry when I heard it that my lungs nearly burst. I have been a cow for landlords and a horse for capitalists, so I know what class suffering and class hatred are. I only believe in Chairman Mao's words: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not readily accept their defeat. They will try every day and every moment to restore their power in China." The practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has proven that those who loudly proclaim "the enemies have been almost eliminated" are the most dangerous enemies. We workers will not be fooled by China's Khrushchev. We must fight at the forefront of the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads.

Last autumn, Chairman Mao's Red Guards came to Shanghai, igniting the revolutionary fire and spreading the revolutionary wind. A small clique of capitalist roaders within the old Shanghai Municipal Committee desperately struggled, using one tactic after another. They even went so far as to push many model workers to the front line, attempting to deceive us into protecting them. One day, the old Federation of Trade Unions suddenly invited me to a meeting. At the meeting, the biggest capitalist roader within the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee used the most vicious language to attack the Red Guards, inciting everyone to oppose them. I thought, Chairman Mao has repeatedly received the Red Guards, while these people are terrified and hate them. Chairman Mao loves them, but they hate them. Isn't this a direct confrontation with Chairman Mao? I saw through the evil intentions of this meeting and firmly declared that I would not leave Chairman Mao's side. Later, when the Red Guards rebelled at the old Municipal Committee, some people within the old Transportation Bureau Party Committee hinted that I should go to the scene and express my views. I went there and saw some people attacking the Red Guards, which made me very angry. I clearly stated that the working class must follow Chairman Mao's words and fully support the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards. Soon, I joined the workers' rebel group.

At that time, they tried to transfer me to drive for the Red Guards, attempting to let me "do the work of the Red Guards." At this critical juncture of the struggle between the two classes and the two lines, I firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." I opposed the schemes of the small clique of capitalist roaders within the old Municipal Committee and supported the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards. Whenever the battle needed it, whether it was under the scorching sun or pouring rain, whether it was early morning or midnight, I would immediately drive, transporting the revolutionary comrades to the streets for propaganda or to the old Municipal Committee to rebel. I fought side by side with them, and I told them, "Against the class enemies, we must be ruthless!"

The class enemies will not retreat from the stage of history on their own. China's Khrushchev and a small clique of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist roaders are still alive, their hearts undying. Various kinds of chameleons and small insects are making their last struggles, attempting to reverse the verdict. We must keep our minds on high alert, swords drawn, and never forget class struggle. Wherever there are class enemies, we must attack them. In the turbulent waves of class struggle, we must continuously raise our awareness of line struggle, closely follow the great leader Chairman Mao, be loyal and brave, and march forward.

Under the socialist system, class struggle not only has not "extinguished" but remains the root of all our political and social life. Comrade Yu Xingzhou, the head of the Revolutionary Committee of the Shanghai Port Bureau's 7th District, said:

In Handling All Kinds of Issues, We Must Firmly Grasp the Key of Class Struggle

China's Khrushchev goes to great lengths to propagate the theory of the "extinction of class struggle," attempting to make us lose our political direction and become confused, so that this small clique of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist roaders who have infiltrated the revolutionary ranks can comfortably usurp the party and the government, changing the color of the country. This is nothing but a pipe dream!

I am a cadre who has been cultivated by the party for many years. The great proletarian cultural revolution has made me further realize that under the socialist system, the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie not only has not "extinguished" but remains the root of all our political and social life. When we analyze and handle issues, we must firmly grasp the key of class struggle. Otherwise, we will be deceived by many superficial phenomena, unable to distinguish right from wrong, friend from foe.

During the "January Revolution" storm, a small clique of capitalist roaders spread the evil wind of economism. For a time, the port was shrouded in a thick mist. I repeatedly thought: This is not about welfare or economic issues; it is about whether to oppose capitalism or socialism. It must be the class enemies playing tricks. So, I stood up and, on the one hand, strictly prevented others from signing and paying; on the other hand, no matter how much they "attacked" me, I refused to sign and pay. In the end, I and the broad revolutionary masses together repelled the enemy and stopped the evil wind.

Last February, a wave of reversing verdicts came, and ghosts and monsters took the opportunity to crawl out, stirring up trouble. One day, a spy ran into the office, arrogantly demanding that I "reverse his verdict." I thought, this is the class enemy unwilling to accept their defeat, counterattacking the proletariat. I must not give an inch and must confront them head-on. So, I stood up and fiercely rebuked him: "To reverse your verdict, absolutely not! You must behave yourself and not cause trouble!"

The class enemies are everywhere, and class struggle is omnipresent. The enemy spreads anarchist thoughts, disrupts production; the enemy incites bourgeois factionalism, disrupts the great alliance of revolution. Which of these is not class struggle? In the face of these issues, we must use Chairman Mao's teachings on class, class contradictions, and class struggle to analyze and deal with them.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Class struggle, some classes win, some classes are eliminated. This is history, this is the history of several thousand years of civilization." We must listen to Chairman Mao's words, firmly grasp the key of class struggle; we must not be fooled by China's Khrushchev, forget class struggle, become confused, and go astray.

Living in the midst of intense class struggle, a revolutionary worker, is it to emphasize proletarian politics or to focus on work? Is it to first seize the revolution or to only care about production? Comrade Yang Fuzhen, a textile worker from Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Mill, shared her personal experience:

Labor Models Should First Be Models of Revolution

Under socialist conditions, class struggle is very intense. China's Khrushchev, however, talks nonsense about "the main class struggle within the country has basically ended," and therefore advocates that the party's main task is "to raise productivity." He attempts to use this fallacy to numb the minds of the working class, making us lose our political direction and deviate from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. This is a poisonous plot that kills without bloodshed.

I am a child laborer who has suffered the exploitation and oppression of imperialism and capitalists. It is Chairman Mao who has liberated us and made us masters. Having experienced the bitterness of the old society and the sweetness of the new society, I have an unlimited love and loyalty to Chairman Mao and the party, and an intense hatred for imperialism, the bourgeoisie, and the landlords, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. In the past, I was poisoned by the toxins spread by China's Khrushchev, believing that we workers only need to focus on production and ignore politics, class struggle, and national affairs. I thought this way and acted this way: for eighteen years, I was close to the cloth, and the cloth was close to me, meticulous in every detail. I thought this was the most important responsibility of a worker and a communist.

Who would have thought that focusing only on production and ignoring politics would unknowingly lead me astray. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads. In this great storm, I fell hard and was once deceived by a small clique of capitalist roaders within the party, standing on the wrong side.

Falling is like a child falling and getting up immediately? Or like an old person of seventy or eighty falling and not being able to get up? Revolutionary comrades and old workers encouraged me: "Learn from the child, fall and get up, learn to walk again." I stood up and stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, joining the proletarian revolutionary faction to overthrow the small clique of capitalist roaders within the party.

This fall and rise made my mind clear and my eyes bright, understanding many truths.

I understood why I fell, because I did not truly internalize Chairman Mao's teachings, make them part of my blood, and put them into action. Chairman Mao pointed out the three great revolutionary movements to build a powerful socialist country, with class struggle being the first. I, however, only cared about production and ignored class struggle. Chairman Mao taught us: "We must not be too naive, simplifying the complex class struggle." I, however, only saw those landlords, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists whose faces had been exposed, and was not good at identifying class enemies who acted in special circumstances, especially a small clique of traitors and spies who had infiltrated the party and the counter-revolutionary two-faced elements who waved the red flag to oppose the red flag.

A thousand truths, ten thousand truths, boil down to one truth: "Never forget class struggle." After this great storm, I deeply understood that to weave for the revolution, the revolution is not just weaving; the revolution is to seize class struggle. If we do not seize class struggle, allowing class enemies like China's Khrushchev to usurp the party and the country, changing the color of the country, then no matter how good or how much cloth we weave, it will be of no use. Labor models should first be models of revolution, standing by the weaving machine, also putting class struggle first. I will, with a hundredfold vigilance against class enemies and a thousandfold loyalty to Chairman Mao, fiercely criticize China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies, eliminate their poison, and become a warrior who consciously defends Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in the stormy waves of class struggle.

Class enemies, if you do not fight them, they will fight you. We must be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, charging and attacking in the class struggle and line struggle, actively attacking the class enemies. Comrade Guo Sanzhen, a worker from the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory, said:

The Storm Cultivates a Red Heart, Struggle Forges Loyalty

I am a young person who grew up under the red flag, graduating from a technical school and coming to the factory. During the socialist education movement, I joined the party. I have not seen armed enemies, nor have I fought with enemies in the gunfire like revolutionary predecessors. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I have learned a profound lesson, further understanding that there is class struggle under the socialist system, and the Communist Party is engaged in class struggle. We are loyal to Chairman Mao and must go to the stormy waves of class struggle to fight with class enemies, thus forging a thoroughly red "loyalty."

When the flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution burned in our factory, we broad proletarian revolutionaries exposed a small clique of traitors, spies, and capitalist roaders within the party. However, a small clique of capitalist roaders within the old Shanghai Municipal Committee stood on the reactionary position of the bourgeoisie, distorting right and wrong, using every possible means to protect a traitor with clear evidence. They used every vile and malicious method to threaten and entice me. This was a severe test for me, a young person who had been in the factory for less than a year and had been in the party for only a few months.

I repeatedly thought: Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whoever stands on the side of the revolutionary people is a revolutionary, and whoever stands on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism is a counter-revolutionary." That person, in the struggle against the enemy, ran away and betrayed the enemy, standing completely on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and is undoubtedly a thorough traitor and counter-revolutionary. I am loyal to Chairman Mao and must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, overthrow all traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionary two-faced elements, and not allow them to swindle and cause trouble in the revolutionary ranks.

When the struggle was sharp and the pressure was great, I had a thought: "If I really stood on the wrong side, what would happen? I am just a probationary party member, and my conversion to a full member would be in question. Forget it!" However, facing the burning flames of the revolutionary struggle, looking at the brave comrades fighting, I suddenly realized that I was at a critical juncture of standing on which side. Loyalty or not, it depends on whether it is for "self" or "public." Looking up at the great leader Chairman Mao's portrait, I swore from the bottom of my heart: "Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! The small clique of capitalist roaders within the party wants to use my deep class feelings for you to make me betray your revolutionary line, and I have had private thoughts, producing the word 'fear.' This is the greatest disloyalty to you. To defend you, to defend your revolutionary line, no matter how much pressure they apply, I will dare to climb the mountain of knives and leap into the sea of fire. I have decided to rebel..."

From then on, I charged into the waves of class struggle, facing attacks, insults, imprisonment, and beatings. However, I firmly remembered: Loyalty to Chairman Mao means not turning or losing our way in the great storms and waves, daring to fight with the invading enemies to the death.

The practice of struggle tells us: Class enemies, if you do not fight them, they will fight you. We must be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, actively attacking the class enemies, and overthrowing China's Khrushchev and all class enemies. A red heart and a "loyalty" character must be cultivated in the storm and forged in struggle.

Class struggle is complex, and class enemies are cunning. They use both soft and hard methods against revolutionary people, sometimes using cannonballs and sometimes using candy bullets. Comrade Chen Xinfu, a worker from the Shanghai Pioneer Electric Machine Factory and the head of the Revolutionary Committee, said: We must not only win battles against cannonballs,

But also win battles against candy bullets

After we proletarian revolutionaries took power, there is still an intense struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads. In this struggle, one of the important means the bourgeoisie uses to attack the proletariat is to open up gaps in economics and living standards, pulling communist party members and revolutionary fighters to the side of the bourgeoisie. Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "There may be some communists who have not been defeated by armed enemies, and they are heroes in front of these enemies; but they cannot withstand the attack of sugar-coated bullets, and they will lose the battle in front of candy bullets." We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings and never be complacent, letting the class enemies pull us out.

One day, after finishing a meeting in the city, it was already late at night, and there were no more buses, so I walked back to the factory. Walking along, I had a thought: "Should I call the factory to send a car to pick me up?" Once, I went to the assembly group of the third workshop to work, and a reporter came to take a TV shot of me. Later, a worker comrade criticized me: "You don't often come here to work, but you run to the front for the TV shot"; another old worker said: "Little Chen, you've become an 'official,' you have to be careful!" These sharp criticisms and warm care touched my soul. I suddenly thought: Various situations indicate that my position has changed, and my thoughts are also changing. If I do not alert myself in time, it will develop into "peaceful evolution," and I will slide to the side of the bourgeoisie.

From then on, I insisted on participating in physical labor, often "rolling" among the masses, and striving to maintain the character of an ordinary laborer. When there are achievements, I attribute them to the great thought of Mao Zedong; when there are honors, I attribute them to the broad masses of workers. I strive to act according to Chairman Mao's instructions: "Continue to maintain the spirit of hard struggle."

I deeply feel that this is not a small matter of personal life, but a big matter of class struggle. Always maintaining the spirit of hard struggle can forever preserve revolutionary youth, and in the stormy winds and poisonous mists of class struggle, defeat all enemies.

The struggle between the two lines within the party is directly related to the fate of the country and is a decisive struggle. In the struggle of lines, the question of which side we stand on is a top priority. Comrade Cheng Dewang, a tricycle worker, said excitedly:

We Must Not Leave Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line by an Inch

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I received profound education, which can be summed up in one point: recognizing that the struggle of lines within the party is a reflection of class struggle in society.

In the old society, I suffered greatly, and five out of eight family members died of cold and hunger. It was Chairman Mao who saved me, and it was Mao Zedong Thought that nurtured me. I always thought that I was loyal to Chairman Mao without any problems. However, I never imagined that within our party, there would be a bourgeois headquarters hiding a big tiger like China's Khrushchev. Therefore, in the early days of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I was once used by a small clique of capitalist roaders within the old Shanghai Municipal Committee, standing on the wrong side and taking the wrong path. It was Chairman Mao who, in the storm of the "January Revolution," issued a great call, bringing me back to the proletarian revolutionary line.

From then on, I deeply realized that under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, class struggle is prominently manifested as the struggle between the two lines within the party. We are loyal to Chairman Mao and must raise our awareness of line struggle, resolutely overthrow China's Khrushchev and his accomplices. In the past, I wholeheartedly served the workers and peasants and firmly fought against those who undermined the foundations of socialism. I thought this was listening to Chairman Mao's words and never forgetting class struggle. After this great storm, I realized that this was far from enough. Under socialist conditions, to never forget class struggle, we must be a hundred times more vigilant against the most dangerous enemies who wave the red flag to oppose the red flag.

Over the past year, I have striven to make new contributions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and launch an offensive against class enemies. When the counter-revolutionary economism wind blew, a small clique of people with ulterior motives jumped out, insisting on immediately reforming the ownership of tricycles, claiming that "the tricycle industry has walked the capitalist road for seventeen years," and even forcing me to follow them. I realized that this was a vicious attack on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and I must stand up and resist the evil wind, repelling the counter-current. So, I, despite obstacles and threats, used my memories of the old and new societies to compare and contrast, speaking out about the correct leadership of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line since liberation, and about the party's deep care for tricycle workers. I and many comrades together refuted the slanders of the class enemies against the party and socialism, defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

I am a tricycle worker, and countless practices have told me: "If the steering wheel is not held firmly, the car will be crooked, and the direction will be wrong." In the future, I will hold the steering wheel firmly for life, not leaving Chairman Mao's revolutionary line by an inch. We will use the wheels rolling forward on the socialist road to crush China's Khrushchev and all kinds of class enemies, grinding them into powder and sweeping them into the garbage heap of history.

### 我们工人就是阶级斗争的主力军  上海工人批判中国赫鲁晓夫“阶级斗争熄灭”论笔谈会

专栏：七亿人民都来做批判家

    我们工人就是阶级斗争的主力军
    上海工人批判中国赫鲁晓夫“阶级斗争熄灭”论笔谈会
    在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大搏斗中，我们工人阶级一定要站在斗争的最前哨。上海汽车运输九场九○一车队驾驶员张文连同志说：
    要不断提高路线斗争的觉悟
    中国赫鲁晓夫说：“敌人消灭的差不多了”，“反革命已经解决的差不多了”，“阶级两个字是值得考虑了”。呸，这简直是一派胡言！我听了肺都气炸了。我做过地主的牛，当过资本家的马，懂得什么叫阶级苦，什么叫阶级仇。我只相信毛主席他老人家的话：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，……他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。”无产阶级文化大革命的实践证明，口口声声宣扬“敌人消灭的差不多了”的中国赫鲁晓夫，以及他那个资产阶级司令部的一套一套的班子，正是最危险的敌人。我们工人阶级决不上中国赫鲁晓夫的当，一定要战斗在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的最前哨。
    前年秋天，毛主席的红卫兵来到上海，大点革命火，大煽革命风。上海旧市委内一小撮走资派疯狂地进行挣扎，使出一手又一手的反革命策略。他们竟丧心病狂地把我们许多五好工人推上第一线，诱骗我们保护他们过关。一天，旧总工会忽然邀请我开会。会上，上海市党内最大的走资派竟用最恶毒的语言攻击红卫兵小将，煽动大家去反对红卫兵。我想，毛主席一次又一次地接见红卫兵，而这些人却怕得要死，恨得要命。毛主席爱护的，他们痛恨，这不是公然和毛主席对抗吗？我识破了这个会议的罪恶目的，坚决表示一步也不离开毛主席。后来，红卫兵在旧市委门前造反，交通局旧党委内一些人又暗示我去现场看看，谈谈看法。我到那里看到一些人围攻红卫兵，感到十分愤怒。我鲜明地表示工人阶级必须听毛主席的话，全力支持红卫兵小将的革命行动。不久，我就参加了工人造反队。
    当时，他们还以调我去给红卫兵开车为名，妄图让我“做红卫兵的工作”。在这两个阶级、两条路线激烈斗争的关口，我牢记毛主席的教导：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”我对于旧市委内一小撮走资派的阴谋，就是要反对；对于红卫兵的革命行动，就是要支持。只要战斗需要，不管是太阳如火，还是大雨倾盆；不管是清早，还是半夜，我都立刻开车，送革命小将们上街宣传，送革命小将们上旧市委造反。我和他们心贴心，肩并肩，一起战斗，我跟他们说：“对阶级敌人，就是要狠！”
    阶级敌人是不会自行退出历史舞台的。中国赫鲁晓夫等一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派人还在，心不死，各种各样的变色龙、小爬虫正在作最后挣扎，妄图翻案。我们思想上一定要枪上膛，刀出鞘，念念不忘阶级斗争，哪里有阶级敌人，就向哪里进攻。在阶级斗争的惊涛骇浪中，我们必须不断提高路线斗争的觉悟，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，赤胆忠心，奋勇向前。
    在社会主义制度下，阶级斗争不但没有“熄灭”，而且仍然是我们全部政治生活和社会生活的总根源。上海港务局七区革命委员会主任于兴洲同志说：我们在处理各种问题时，
    必须紧紧抓住阶级斗争这个纲
    中国赫鲁晓夫费尽心机宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭”论，妄想使我们迷失政治方向，成为糊涂人，好让他们这一小撮钻进革命队伍的叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派舒舒服服地篡党篡政，改变国家的颜色。这真是白日做梦！
    我是一个受党培养多年的干部。轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，使我进一步认识到，在社会主义制度下，无产阶级和资产阶级的斗争不但没有“熄灭”，而且仍然是我们全部政治生活和社会生活的总根源。我们分析问题、处理问题，一定要紧紧抓住阶级斗争这条纲。不这样，就会被许多表面现象所迷惑，分不清是非，分不清敌我。
    在“一月革命”风暴中，一小撮走资派大刮经济主义妖风。一时，海港妖雾迷漫。我反复思考：这绝不是什么福利问题、经济问题，这是造资本主义的反还是造社会主义的反的问题，一定是阶级敌人捣的鬼。于是，我挺身而出，一方面严格制止别人签字付款；一方面任凭怎样“围攻”，自己就是不签字付款。结果，我终于和广大革命群众一起，击退了敌人，刹住了妖风。
    去年二月，一股翻案逆流袭来，牛鬼蛇神乘机出笼，蠢蠢而动。一天，一个特务分子跑进办公室，气势汹汹地要我给他“平反”。我想，这是阶级敌人不甘心自己的失败，在向无产阶级反攻倒算了，必须寸步不让，针锋相对。于是，我霍地站起来，痛斥了这个家伙：“要我给你‘平反’，绝对办不到，只许你规规矩矩，不许你乱说乱动！”
    阶级敌人是无孔不入的，阶级斗争是无所不在的。敌人散布无政府主义思潮，破坏生产；敌人煽动资产阶级派性，破坏革命大联合，哪一桩不是阶级斗争？在这些问题面前，我们必须用毛主席所指示的阶级、阶级矛盾、阶级斗争的观点去分析、去对待。
    毛主席教导我们：“阶级斗争，一些阶级胜利了，一些阶级消灭了。这就是历史，这就是几千年的文明史。”我们就是要听毛主席的话，紧紧抓住阶级斗争这个纲；决不上中国赫鲁晓夫的当，忘记阶级斗争，变成糊涂人，走到邪路上去。
    生活在激烈的阶级斗争中，一个革命工人，是突出无产阶级政治，还是埋头业务？是首先抓革命，还是只顾生产？上海国棉一厂纺织女工杨富珍同志的切身体会是：
    劳动模范，首先应该是抓革命的模范
    社会主义条件下，阶级斗争是十分激烈的。中国赫鲁晓夫却胡说什么“国内主要的阶级斗争已经基本上结束了”，因而主张党的主要任务“就是要提高生产力”。他妄图用这套谬论来麻痹我们工人阶级的头脑，使我们迷失政治方向，离开毛主席革命路线的轨道。这是一条杀人不见血的毒计。
    我是童工出身，受尽了帝国主义、资本家的剥削和压迫，是毛主席使我们翻身当了主人。吃过旧社会的苦，懂得新社会的甜，所以我对毛主席、对党无限热爱，无限忠诚，对帝国主义、资产阶级、地富反坏右无比痛恨。过去我中了中国赫鲁晓夫散布的毒素，认为我们工人只要集中精力把生产搞好，别的什么政治，什么阶级斗争，什么国家大事，都可以不管。我这样想，也这样做：十八年来，我心贴布，布贴心，一丝不苟。我以为，这就是一个工人、一个共产党员最主要的责任。
    哪里晓得，只管生产，忘了政治，竟不知不觉地走上了岔路。无产阶级文化大革命是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争。在这场大风浪中，我跟斗栽得不轻，曾经受党内一小撮走资派的蒙蔽，站错过队。
    栽了跟斗，是象小孩子跌跤，立刻站起来？还是象七八十岁的老人跌跤，站不起来？无产阶级革命派的战友们和老工人都勉励我：“学小孩子，跌倒就起来，重新学走路。”我站了起来，站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，和无产阶级革命派一起，大造党内一小撮走资派的反。
    这一跌一站，使我头脑清醒，眼睛明亮，懂得了许多道理。
    我懂得了为什么会跌跤，就是因为没有真正把毛主席的教导印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上。毛主席指出建设社会主义强大国家的三大革命运动，第一桩就是阶级斗争。我却只顾生产，把阶级斗争抛在脑后。毛主席教导我们：“切不可书生气十足，把复杂的阶级斗争看得太简单了。”我却只看到那些面目已经暴露的地富反坏右分子，而不善于辨别那些在特殊情况下从事活动的阶级敌人，特别是一小撮钻进党内来的叛徒、特务和打着“红旗”反红旗的反革命两面派。
    千条道理，万条道理，归结为一条道理，就是“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”。经过这场大风大浪，我深深懂得了：要为革命织布，但革命不仅是织布，革命就是要抓阶级斗争。如果不抓阶级斗争，听凭中国赫鲁晓夫这样的阶级敌人篡党篡国，使国家变了颜色，那末，布织得再好、再多，也没有用。劳动模范，首先应该是抓革命的模范，站在织布机旁，也要把阶级斗争放在第一位。我要以对阶级敌人的百倍警惕，对毛主席的万倍忠诚，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义谬论，肃清它的流毒，做一个在阶级斗争中顶风破浪，自觉捍卫毛主席革命路线的战士。
    阶级敌人，你不斗他，他就斗你。我们一定要无限忠于毛主席，在阶级斗争和路线斗争中猛冲猛打，主动向阶级敌人进攻。上海柴油机厂工人郭三珍同志说：
    风浪培养红心，斗争锤炼“忠”字
    我是一个在红旗下长大的青年，技术学校毕业后来到工厂，在社会主义教育运动中入了党。我没有见过拿枪的敌人，更没有象革命前辈那样在枪林弹雨中跟敌人拚过刺刀。在这场无产阶级文化大革命中，我上了深刻的一课，进一步懂得了社会主义制度下就是有阶级斗争，共产党就是搞阶级斗争的。我们忠于毛主席，就要到阶级斗争的大风大浪中去和阶级敌人搏斗，这样才能炼出一个透红透红的“忠”字来。
    当无产阶级文化大革命的烈火在我们厂里熊熊燃起的时候，我们广大无产阶级革命派揪出了党内一小撮叛徒、特务、走资派。但是旧上海市委内一小撮走资派站在资产阶级的反动立场上，颠倒黑白，千方百计地包庇一个证据确凿的叛徒。他们用尽卑鄙恶毒的手段对我进行威胁利诱。这对我这个进厂不到一年、入党才几个月的年青人说来，确是一场严峻的考验。
    我反复思考：毛主席教导我们：“什么人站在革命人民方面，他就是革命派，什么人站在帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义方面，他就是反革命派。”那个家伙在对敌斗争中丢枪逃跑，投敌叛变，那就是完全站到帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义方面去了，当然是地地道道的叛徒、反革命。我忠于毛主席，就一定要遵照毛主席的教导，打倒一切叛徒、特务和反革命两面派，决不能让他们混在革命队伍中招摇撞骗，为非作歹。
    当斗争尖锐、压力很大的时候，我头脑里也闪过一个念头：“要是真的站错了队，那怎么办？自己才是个预备党员，转正不就成问题了吗？算了吧！”但是，面对熊熊的革命斗争烈火，环顾英勇战斗的同志，我猛然警觉到自己正处在站到哪一边的严重关口。忠不忠，就看为“私”还是为“公”。我仰望伟大领袖毛主席的画像，从心底里发出誓言：“毛主席啊，毛主席！党内一小撮走资派想利用我对您老人家深厚的阶级感情，叫我背叛您的革命路线，而我竟有了私心，产生了‘怕’字，这是对您老人家最大的不忠。为了保卫您，保卫您的革命路线，不管他们再施加多少压力，我刀山敢上，火海敢闯，我这个反造定了。……”
    从此，我迎头冲进一阵阵阶级斗争的惊涛恶浪，遭到过围攻、谩骂、关押、毒打。但是我牢牢记住：忠于毛主席，就要在大风大浪中不转向、不迷航，就要敢于和来犯的敌人拚个你死我活。
    斗争的实践告诉我们：阶级敌人，你不斗他，他就斗你。我们一定要无限忠于毛主席，主动向阶级敌人进攻，把中国赫鲁晓夫和一切阶级敌人统统打翻在地。一颗红心，一个“忠”字，就要在风浪里培养，就要在斗争中锻炼。
    阶级斗争是复杂的，阶级敌人是狡猾的，他们对革命人民软硬兼施，有时用炮弹，有时用糖弹。上海先锋电机厂工人、革命委员会主任陈新发同志说：我们不但要在炮弹面前打胜仗，
    在糖弹面前也要打胜仗
    我们无产阶级革命派掌权以后，仍然存在着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争。在这场斗争中，资产阶级向无产阶级进攻的一种重要手段，就是从经济上、生活上打开缺口，把共产党人、革命战士拉到资产阶级一边去。毛主席早就指出：“可能有这样一些共产党人，他们是不曾被拿枪的敌人征服过的，他们在这些敌人面前不愧英雄的称号；但是经不起人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击，他们在糖弹面前要打败仗。”我们一定要牢记毛主席的教导，切莫上中国赫鲁晓夫“阶级斗争熄灭”论的当，千万不能麻痹大意，让阶级敌人把我们拉了出去。
    有一天，我在市里开完会，已经深夜，公共汽车没有了，我步行回厂。走着走着，脑子里闪过这样的念头：“是否打个电话让厂里派小汽车来接我？”有一次，我到三车间装配组劳动，一位记者来给我拍摄了电视镜头。事后，有个工人同志对我提意见：“你平时来这儿参加劳动不多，拍电视倒跑在前头”；还有个老师傅说：“小陈，当‘官’了，可得注意啊！”这些尖锐的批评，亲切的关怀，触动了我的灵魂。我猛然想起：种种情况，说明自己地位起了变化，思想也在变了，如果不及时警惕起来，发展下去，就会“和平演变”，就会滑到资产阶级那边去。
    从此以后，我坚持参加体力劳动，经常“滚”在群众里，努力要求自己保持一个普通劳动者的本色。有了成绩，归功于伟大的毛泽东思想，有了荣誉，归功于广大的工人群众。我努力要求自己照毛主席的指示办事：“继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。”
    我深深体会到，这不是个人生活的小事，而是阶级斗争的大事。永远保持艰苦奋斗的作风，就能永葆革命的青春，在阶级斗争的险风恶浪、“香风”毒雾中，战胜一切敌人。
    党内两条路线的斗争，直接关系到国家的前途和命运，是决定性的斗争。在路线斗争中，我们站在哪一边的问题，是个头等重要的问题。三轮车工人程德旺同志激动地说：
    要寸步不离毛主席的革命路线
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我受到了极深刻的教育，集中到一点，就是认识到党内路线斗争完全是社会上阶级斗争的反映。
    我在旧社会，苦大仇深，一家八口人冻死饿死了五个。是毛主席救了我，是毛泽东思想哺育了我。我一直以为自己忠于毛主席是没有问题的了。但是，过去我万万没有想到，在我们党内会隐藏着一个资产阶级司令部，睡着中国赫鲁晓夫这样的大老虎。因此，在无产阶级文化大革命初期，我曾经被旧上海市委内一小撮走资派所利用，站错过队，走错过路。是毛主席他老人家在“一月革命”风暴中发出伟大号召，把我引回到无产阶级革命路线上来的。
    从此，我深深认识到，在无产阶级专政条件下，阶级斗争突出地表现为党内两条路线的斗争。我们忠于毛主席，就要提高路线斗争的觉悟，坚决打倒中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙。过去我一心一意为工农兵服务，坚决同那些拆社会主义墙脚的地富反坏右分子作针锋相对的斗争。自己以为这就是听毛主席的话，念念不忘阶级斗争了。经过这场大风浪，我才明白，这是远远不够的。在社会主义条件下，要念念不忘阶级斗争，就要百倍警惕那些打着“红旗”反红旗的最危险的敌人。
    一年多来，我努力要求自己在无产阶级文化大革命中立新功，向阶级敌人打进攻战。当反革命经济主义妖风刮来时，一小撮别有用心的人乘机跳出来，硬要立即改革三轮车的所有制，胡说什么“三轮车行业十七年来走的是资本主义道路”，还逼我跟着他们一起走。我警觉到这是阶级敌人对毛主席革命路线的恶毒攻击，必须挺身而出，顶住妖风，击退逆流。于是我不顾阻挡和威吓，用自己对新旧社会的回忆对比，大讲解放以来毛主席革命路线的正确领导，大讲共产党对三轮车工人的深切关怀。我和许多同志一起，驳倒了阶级敌人对党、对社会主义的污蔑，捍卫了毛主席革命路线。
    我是个三轮车工人，千万次实践告诉我：“龙头”把不准，车子就要歪歪斜斜，方向就走不对头。今后我要一辈子把准“龙头”，一步也不脱离毛主席的革命路线的轨道。我们要用在社会主义大道上滚滚前进的车轮，把中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派和各色各样的阶级敌人，统统碾个粉身碎骨，把他们扫进历史的垃圾堆。
