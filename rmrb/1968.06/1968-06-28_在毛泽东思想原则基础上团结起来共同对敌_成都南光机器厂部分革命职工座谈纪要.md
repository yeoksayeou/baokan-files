Workers of the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres of Chengdu Nanguan Machine Factory, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, have continuously strengthened and developed the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. They have united as one, fought together against the enemy, and created a good situation, achieving victory after victory in both revolution and production. Recently, some revolutionary workers of this factory held a discussion on their experiences in the struggle.

Strengthen the Awareness of Enemy Situation, Thoroughly Smash the Plot of the Class Enemy to Split the Revolutionary Ranks of the Proletariat

Zhang Shuxun (Worker of the 7th Workshop): The revolutionary committees of Sichuan Province and Chengdu City have been successfully established, and our factory's revolutionary committee was also established in late May. The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the country, the province, and our factory is excellent and getting better. In the face of this excellent situation, we must always remember the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching: "Never forget class struggle." We must heighten our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold and thoroughly smash the tricks and plots of a handful of class enemies in their desperate struggles. Originally, there were several revolutionary mass organizations in our 7th Workshop. In September last year, we closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and achieved revolutionary great alliance by system, forming a unified organization. The situation of revolution and production was excellent. Who would have thought that soon after, contradictions suddenly arose within the ranks of the revolutionary cadres, and the differences became increasingly pronounced, affecting both revolution and production. Through studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the important editorials in the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily, "Seven Million People of Sichuan Are Advancing," we analyzed the new situation of class struggle and heightened our awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. We finally discovered that the class enemies were causing trouble and spreading the evil wind of destroying the revolutionary great alliance. Thus, we armed the masses with Chairman Mao's latest instructions and teachings on class struggle, strengthened everyone's awareness of the enemy situation, and directed our efforts against a handful of class enemies. Once the masses were mobilized, the class enemies could no longer hide. Their ugly faces of splitting the revolutionary ranks were exposed in broad daylight. The living reality of class struggle made our comrades further strengthen their unity, promoting revolution and production. This incident tells us that only by firmly grasping the direction of the revolutionary struggle, focusing on class struggle, and deeply and persistently carrying out the revolutionary great criticism, can we expose those class enemies hiding in dark corners and making trouble. Only in this way can we continuously strengthen the firm unity within the ranks of the revolutionary cadres and consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. At the same time, only by continuously consolidating and developing the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought can we thoroughly expose the enemy, strike the enemy hard, and better implement Chairman Mao's great line of "Grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and prepare for war."

Correctly Distinguish Between Two Types of Contradictions, Use Criticism and Self-Criticism to Resolve Differences Within the Revolutionary Ranks

Nie Jianming, He Xiancheng (Workers of the 1st Workshop): Chairman Mao teaches us: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question for the revolution, and it is also the primary question for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." The contradiction between the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat, the broad revolutionary masses, and a handful of class enemies is an antagonistic contradiction. The differences within the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat and among the revolutionary masses are contradictions among the people. Some comrades who previously took the wrong side are still our class brothers. We must strictly distinguish between the two types of contradictions according to Chairman Mao's teachings, correctly treat these comrades, further consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, unite as one, and strike hard at a handful of class enemies.

Peng Huanran, He Changfa (Workers of the 11th Workshop): Sometimes, due to differences in understanding specific issues, contradictions arise among various revolutionary mass organizations and revolutionary masses, which is normal and not surprising. How do we handle differences? We adopted the method of sitting down together and bringing out opinions on the table to discuss, frequently carrying out criticism and self-criticism, especially emphasizing "each doing more self-criticism," to eliminate differences. The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." The practice of struggle has made us realize: Chairman Mao's teaching is a universal truth. We revolutionary cadres of the proletariat must resolutely follow it, think as one, work as one, concentrate our efforts, and launch a fierce attack against a handful of class enemies. Only in this way can we consolidate the victories we have already achieved and continuously seize new victories.

Unite All Revolutionary Forces That Can Be United, Always Direct the Struggle Against a Handful of Class Enemies

Feng Mingsheng, Zhang Zhaoxin (Workers of the 7th Workshop): The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under socialist conditions, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and the broad revolutionary masses led by it and the reactionary Kuomintang, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's great teaching. To unite all revolutionary forces that can be united and fight together against the enemy, we have extensively carried out heart-to-heart talks within the ranks of the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat, studied Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, extensively discussed the new situation, new characteristics, and new trends of class struggle, and discussed the importance of strengthening unity within the ranks of the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat. For some masses temporarily deceived by class enemies, we visited their homes, recalled bitterness and sweetness with them, fought against selfishness and criticized revisionism, awakened them to strengthen their awareness of the enemy situation, and heightened their class consciousness and awareness of the struggle between the two lines, quickly returning to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In this way, we united the broad revolutionary masses and strengthened the revolutionary forces. In the struggle against the enemy, the masses who were previously deceived actively exposed the evil activities of the class enemies, striking hard at a handful of class enemies.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." The enemy tries every means to split the revolutionary ranks of the proletariat, so we must unite more closely and always direct our struggle against a handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and other open and hidden counter-revolutionaries, thoroughly smashing the various plots of the class enemies and consolidating and developing the revolutionary great alliance by system, by industry, and by class. Currently, the revolutionary masses in our workshop are all actively taking action, forming an iron fist, aiming at the class enemies. Those fish in troubled waters will not escape!

Huang Guangcheng, Chen Jianying (Workers of the 13th Workshop): To closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, unite all revolutionary forces that can be united, and always direct the struggle against a handful of class enemies, we must deeply and persistently carry out the revolutionary great criticism. We must thoroughly criticize and expose Liu Shaoqi and other capitalist-roaders within the party, their agents in Southwest China and Sichuan, and a handful of capitalist-roaders in our factory, smashing the various plots of the class enemies to reverse cases and restore the old order. Carrying out the revolutionary great criticism and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation within our unit is our common battle task. If we cannot unite as one and persist in carrying out the revolutionary great criticism, persist in launching a sustained and fierce attack against a handful of class enemies, the class enemies may ride over our heads again and impose bourgeois dictatorship on us. We would have to suffer twice, which is a very dangerous situation! We are determined to unite as one, fight together against the enemy, take Comrade Lei Feng as our shining example, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever follow Chairman Mao, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    在毛泽东思想原则基础上团结起来共同对敌
    ——成都南光机器厂部分革命职工座谈纪要
    成都南光机器厂无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，在毛泽东思想的原则基础上，不断巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合，团结一致，共同对敌，发展大好形势，夺得了革命和生产的一个又一个胜利。最近，这个厂的部分革命职工，座谈了他们在斗争中取得的体会。
        加强敌情观念，彻底粉碎阶级敌
    人妄图分裂无产阶级革命队伍的阴谋
    张树勋（七车间工人）：四川省和成都市革命委员会胜利诞生了，我厂革命委员会也在五月下旬成立了，全国、全省和我们厂的无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，越来越好。在大好形势面前，我们一定要牢记伟大领袖毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，百倍提高革命警惕，彻底粉碎一小撮阶级敌人进行垂死挣扎的阴谋诡计。我们七车间原来有几个革命群众组织，去年九月就紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，实现了按系统的革命大联合，成立了统一的组织，革命和生产形势一片大好。谁知事隔不久，无产阶级革命派队伍内部突然闹起矛盾来了，而且分歧越来越大，革命和生产都受到影响。我们通过学习毛主席的最新指示，学习《人民日报》、《解放军报》的重要社论《七千万四川人民在前进》，分析了阶级斗争的新形势，提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，终于发现是阶级敌人在捣鬼，在刮破坏革命大联合的妖风。于是，我们用毛主席的最新指示和关于阶级斗争的教导武装群众头脑，加强大家的敌情观念，矛头直指一小撮阶级敌人。群众一发动起来，阶级敌人就藏不住了，他们分裂革命队伍的丑恶面目就暴露在光天化日之下了。活生生的阶级斗争现实，使我们的同志进一步加强了团结，促进了革命和生产。这件事告诉我们，只有牢牢掌握革命斗争大方向，狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，把那些隐藏在阴暗角落里兴风作浪的阶级敌人挖出来，才能不断增强无产阶级革命派内部的坚强团结，巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合。同时，也只有在毛泽东思想的原则基础上不断巩固和发展革命大联合和革命三结合，才能彻底揭露敌人，狠狠打击敌人，才能更好地贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大方针。
      正确区分两类不同性质的矛盾，用
  批评和自我批评的方法解决革命队伍内
    部的分歧
    聂建铭、贺先成（一车间工人）：毛主席教导我们：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题，也是文化大革命的首要问题。”无产阶级革命派、广大革命群众和一小撮阶级敌人的矛盾，是敌我矛盾。无产阶级革命派内部、革命群众之间存在的一些分歧，是人民内部矛盾。一些过去站错了队的同志，仍然是我们的阶级兄弟。我们一定要按照毛主席的教导，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，正确对待这些同志，进一步巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合，团结一致，狠狠打击一小撮阶级敌人。
    彭焕然、何昌发（十一车间工人）：各个革命群众组织和革命群众之间，有时由于对一些具体问题的认识有分歧，出现一些矛盾，是正常的，不足为怪的。有了分歧怎么办？我们采取了大家坐下来，有意见拿到桌面上来谈的办法，经常开展批评与自我批评，特别强调要“各自多做自我批评”，来消除分歧。伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”斗争实践使我们体会到：毛主席的这一教导是放之四海而皆准的真理。我们无产阶级革命派只有坚决照办，心往一处想，劲往一处使，集中力量，向一小撮阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，才能巩固我们已经取得的胜利，不断夺取新的胜利。
        团结一切可以团结的革命力量，
    始终把斗争矛头对准一小撮阶级敌人
    冯明生、张朝新（七车间工人）：伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”我们一定要牢牢记住毛主席的这一伟大教导。为了团结一切可以团结的革命力量，共同对敌，我们在无产阶级革命派内部广泛开展谈心活动，学习毛主席的一系列最新指示，大谈阶级斗争的新形势，新特点，新动向，大议增强无产阶级革命派内部团结的重要意义。对一些一时受阶级敌人蒙蔽的群众，我们上门访问，同他们一起忆苦思甜，一起斗私批修，启发他们增强敌情观念，提高阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，迅速回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。这样，我们就团结了广大革命群众，壮大了革命力量。在对敌斗争的大会上，原来受蒙蔽的群众积极起来揭发阶级敌人的罪恶活动，狠狠打击了一小撮阶级敌人。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”敌人千方百计分裂无产阶级的革命队伍，我们就越要紧密团结起来，把斗争矛头始终对准一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派以及其他公开的、暗藏的反革命分子，彻底粉碎阶级敌人的各种阴谋活动，巩固和发展按系统、按行业、按班级的革命大联合。目前，我们车间的革命群众都积极行动起来，捏成一个铁拳头，对准阶级敌人，那些混水摸鱼的害人虫一个也跑不了啦！
    黄光成、陈建英（十三车间工人）：要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，团结一切可以团结的革命力量，始终把矛头对准一小撮阶级敌人，就必须深入持久地开展革命大批判。我们一定要把中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派及其在西南、四川的代理人和我们厂的一小撮走资派批深批透，斗倒斗臭，粉碎阶级敌人闹翻案、闹复辟的各种阴谋。开展革命大批判，搞好本单位斗批改，是我们的共同战斗任务。如果我们不能团结一致，坚持开展革命大批判，坚持向一小撮阶级敌人发动持久的猛烈的进攻，阶级敌人就有可能重新骑到我们头上来，对我们实行资产阶级专政，我们就要重吃二遍苦，这是多么危险的情景啊！我们决心团结一致，共同对敌，以门合同志为光辉榜样，永远忠于毛主席，永远紧跟毛主席，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！　（新华社成都二十七日电）
