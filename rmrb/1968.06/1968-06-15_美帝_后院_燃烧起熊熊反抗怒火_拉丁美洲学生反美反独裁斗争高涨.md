Students in several Latin American countries continue their anti-American and anti-dictatorship struggles, frequently holding demonstrations and strikes.

In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, students held a demonstration on the evening of the 11th, protesting the pro-American dictatorship's signing of a cultural "aid" agreement with U.S. imperialism and demanding an increase in educational funding. The protesting students were brutally suppressed by reactionary police, but they fearlessly fought back. This demonstration was a continuation of the total strike by more than 15,000 university students on the 5th.

At the same time, university students in the states of Bahia, São Paulo, and Santa Catarina also went on strike.

Since last December, Brazilian students, with their glorious tradition of struggle, have been relentlessly fighting against U.S. imperialist cultural aggression and the reactionary educational policies of the pro-American dictatorship.

Students in Uruguay held intense demonstrations in the capital, Montevideo, from the 6th to the 8th, demanding that the government increase the education budget and sever ties with the International Monetary Fund controlled by U.S. imperialism. The brave students, undeterred by police violence, rushed to the streets in groups to demonstrate. They fought back with stones and sticks against the police's attacks. Angry students also smashed a car belonging to the U.S. embassy. On the 11th, Montevideo saw another demonstration by 400 students.

University students in the Colombian capital, Bogotá, held a demonstration against the pro-American dictatorship on the evening of the 11th. The government, terrified, quickly dispatched police to suppress the demonstration. The protesting students bravely fought back, throwing stones and angrily setting fire to and overturning several police cars.

In the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires, 400 university students recently held a demonstration to protest the pro-American dictatorship of Onganía, which took reactionary measures to abolish university autonomy, strip students of their right to participate in political activities, and exclude poor students from enrollment.
