The Ceylon Communist Party's English weekly "Red Flag" published an editorial on June 3, enthusiastically hailing the just struggles of the people in France, Western Europe, and North America.

The editorial said: We extend our warmest greetings to the revolutionary movements sweeping across Western Europe and North America. We particularly hail the revolutionary events taking place in France, where students, teachers, and workers have united to shake the very foundations of the French ruling class.

The editorial said: This movement is not only a heavy blow to the tottering rule of international imperialism led by U.S. imperialism, but also a powerful counterattack against the policy of class collaboration advocated by modern revisionism centered around the CPSU leadership.

The editorial pointed out: The people's movements in Western Europe and North America have completely shattered the lies fabricated by the revisionists to sabotage the people's struggles. The workers and revolutionary people in France and other capitalist countries are breaking free from the control of modern revisionism and continuing to advance towards revolution.

The editorial said: The revolutionary flames burning in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have now spread to the countries of Western Europe and North America. This is a major development in the world revolutionary struggle.

Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, June 3: The Albanian newspaper "Unity" published a commentary on June 2, enthusiastically hailing the heroic struggle of the French working class, exposing the various tricks of the French ruling class in suppressing the workers' movement, and condemning the treacherous actions of the French revisionists in betraying the working class. The commentary pointed out that in the massive strike struggle involving one thousand French workers, revolutionary workers are increasingly believing that their demands cannot be resolved in parliament, but only through the heroic struggle of the working class.

The commentary pointed out that the French bourgeoisie is terrified by the current strike wave of French workers. They are playing various tricks, suppressing striking workers on the one hand and deceiving on the other.

The commentary said: In suppressing the general strike and limiting the strike to some economic demands, various reformists and modern revisionists have greatly assisted the French ruling class. They, in order to split the unity of the workers, have been sowing discord and engaging in sabotage. The facts once again clearly show that modern revisionists are traitors to the working class and faithful lackeys of the bourgeoisie. The stance currently taken by the French revisionists is the stance of modern revisionism centered around the Soviet revisionists towards the workers' strike struggles. The commentary pointed out that the French working class has defended and carried forward its excellent fighting and revolutionary traditions, and is shaking the foundations of French capitalism with a general strike, adding a new page to the struggle of workers in the entire capitalist world. The struggle of the French working class has won the sympathy and praise of class brothers from all over the world, while making the bourgeoisie of various capitalist countries tremble with fear. No matter what measures the bourgeoisie of capitalist countries take, they cannot stop the revolutionary storm that is rising with great momentum in the capitalist world.

    阿《团结报》谴责法修帮助法国统治集团破坏工人斗争的罪行
    新华社科伦坡三日电  锡兰共产党的英文周刊《红旗》三日发表社论，热烈欢呼法国、西欧和北美人民的正义斗争。
    社论说：我们最热烈地向正在席卷西欧、北美的革命运动致敬。我们特别欢呼在法国发生的革命事件，那里，学生、教师和工人已经联合起来动摇着法国统治集团的整个基础。
    社论说：这个运动不仅是对以美帝为首的国际帝国主义的摇摇欲坠的统治的一个沉重打击，而且也是对以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义所鼓吹的阶级合作政策的有力的反击。
    社论指出：西欧、北美人民运动完全粉碎了修正主义者精心编造出来的破坏人民斗争的谰言。法国和其他资本主义国家的工人和革命人民正在冲破现代修正主义的控制，朝着革命的方向继续前进。
    社论说：正在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲熊熊燃烧的革命火焰现在已蔓延到西欧和北美各国。这是世界革命斗争的重大发展。
    新华社地拉那三日电阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》二日发表评论，热烈欢呼法国工人阶级的英勇斗争，揭露法国统治集团镇压工人运动的各种手腕，谴责法修出卖工人阶级的叛徒行径。评论指出，在法国一千万工人参加的声势浩大的罢工斗争中，革命的工人越来越相信，他们的要求不可能在议会中得到解决，而只有通过工人阶级的英勇斗争才能解决。
    评论指出，法国资产阶级被法国工人目前的罢工高潮吓破了胆。他们玩弄各种手腕，一面镇压罢工工人，一面进行欺骗。
    评论说，在镇压总罢工以及使罢工只局限于一些经济要求方面，各种改良主义者和现代修正主义者帮了法国统治集团的大忙。他们为了分裂工人的团结，在工人中百般挑拨离间，进行破坏的勾当。事实再一次清楚地表明，现代修正主义者是工人阶级的叛徒和资产阶级的忠实走狗。法国修正主义者目前所坚持的立场正是以苏修为中心的现代修正主义对待工人罢工斗争的立场。评论指出，法国工人阶级捍卫和发扬了自己优良的战斗和革命传统，正以总罢工动摇着法国资本主义的根基，并为整个资本主义世界工人的斗争增添了新的一页。法国工人阶级的斗争博得了五洲四海阶级兄弟的同情和赞扬，而使各资本主义国家的资产阶级吓得发抖。不管资本主义国家的资产阶级采取什么措施，都阻挡不住正以磅礴气势在资本主义世界兴起的革命风暴。
