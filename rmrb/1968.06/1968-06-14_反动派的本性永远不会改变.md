The Nature of Reactionaries Will Never Change

A soldier from a certain unit, Dong Yunliang

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Imperialists will never lay down their butcher knives, nor can they become Buddhas until they are utterly destroyed." All reactionary classes that are anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist are the same as imperialists; their nature is absolutely unchangeable.

However, the Chinese Khrushchev blathers on about how "we have already eliminated classes," "class struggle has basically ended," and "landlords and capitalists no longer want to resist socialism," and so on. This is all sheer nonsense! In the nineteen years since the founding of the nation, has there been a single day when class enemies have not been fighting against us? The facts of class struggle exposed during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution—is there a single one that shows the nature of the reactionary classes has changed? The knife wounds all over my body are the most powerful refutation of the reactionary fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev! My family is from Shaji Township, Suining County, Jiangsu Province. In our village, there was a counterrevolutionary rich peasant who had been a bandit and a special agent before liberation. This scoundrel is incorrigible. In the autumn of 1964, he was caught sabotaging the collective economy by me. At that time, I was only seventeen years old, and this scoundrel, seeing that I was young and unarmed, gnashed his teeth and glared at me, hacking at me with a sickle. I was knocked unconscious three times and woke up in pain three times. Against such a villain, I made up my mind to grab him tightly! No matter how he hacked, every time I woke up, I would shout, "Catch the counterrevolutionary!" He wanted to hack me to death and hacked at me eighteen times. I was covered in wounds, almost a bloody mess. Later, my class brothers heard the noise and caught this villain, saving me from the enemy's butcher knife. Isn't this a bloody class struggle?

It is true that the reactionary classes seem to be "changing." When they are surrounded by revolutionary masses and in an unfavorable situation, in order to protect their survival and benefit their future development, they often pretend to be dead and lie down, seeking rebirth in endurance. Or they use the tactic of Sun Wukong entering the belly, infiltrating the revolutionary ranks to engage in counterrevolutionary activities. Or they play both sides, pretending to be loyal in front while stabbing you in the back. However, no matter how much they change, the essence remains the same. They change only their strategies to deal with us, but their reactionary class nature will never change.

Those enemies who are used to changing are more dangerous because they have a layer of disguise, making it easy to deceive some people. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we encountered such class enemies who are used to changing. In the unit where I was assigned to support the left, there was a bad element. He pretended to be serious on the surface. Every time we carried red flags and held up the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the two revolutionary factions, this guy would offer cigarettes and tea, saying, "The army comes to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions to us, it is like rain after a long drought, welcome! Welcome!" However, behind the scenes, he was completely different. He would say to the leader of one faction, "This unit seems to be very close to the other faction, be careful!" Then he would go to the masses of the other faction and whisper, "The army supports you, you should demand a higher price when uniting with the other side, you can't be on equal terms." And so on. He used every means to sabotage the great alliance of revolutionaries and repeatedly instigated armed struggles. Later, the masses exposed his "trick." It turned out that he was a rightist element who had escaped punishment and harbored deep hatred for the socialist cause.

The Chinese Khrushchev, ignoring the numerous living facts of class struggle, insists that class enemies "no longer want to resist socialism." This is a big conspiracy. His purpose is to make us not implement dictatorship over the class enemies, so that they can overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat at will, turning the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and turning the socialist system into a capitalist, semi-feudal, and semi-colonial system. The mighty power of the dictatorship of the proletariat forces the class enemies to wear a nice coat, which is precisely the new feature of class struggle under socialist conditions. We must remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "Be good at distinguishing those who pretend to support the revolution but actually oppose the revolution, and clean them out from all our fronts." We will not pity snake-like villains. Against all class enemies who are anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought, whether they are big snakes or small snakes, black snakes or white snakes, snakes that bare their fangs or snakes that turn into beautiful women, we will resolutely eliminate them, show no mercy, and swear to carry the political revolution under socialist conditions to the end!

### 反动派的本性永远不会改变

    反动派的本性永远不会改变
    某部战士　董云良
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义分子决不肯放下屠刀，他们也决不能成佛，直至他们的灭亡。”一切反共、反人民、反社会主义的反动阶级，和帝国主义者一样，他们的本性是绝对不能改变的。
    中国赫鲁晓夫却胡说什么：“现在我们已经消灭了阶级”，“阶级斗争已经基本结束了”，地主、资本家“已经不愿意反抗社会主义了”，等等。这完全是闭着眼睛说瞎话！建国十九年来，阶级敌人那一天不在和我们作斗争？无产阶级文化大革命中所揭露出来的阶级斗争事实，那一条能说明反动阶级本性已经改变？我全身上下的刀痕，就是对中国赫鲁晓夫的反动谬论最有力的驳斥！我家在江苏省睢宁县沙集公社。我们村里，有一个反革命富农分子，解放前当过土匪、特务。这家伙贼性不改。一九六四年秋天，他破坏集体经济被我揪住了。当时我才十七岁，这家伙欺我人小，手无寸铁，便咬牙瞪眼，用镰刀对我劈头盖脑地乱砍。我被砍昏三次，痛醒三次。对这样的坏蛋，我下定决心要死死揪住他！不管他怎么砍，每一次醒过来，我就高喊抓反革命。他一心要砍死我，向我砍了十八刀。我浑身是伤，简直成了一个血人。后来，阶级兄弟闻声赶来，逮住了这个坏蛋，把我从敌人的屠刀下救了出来。这不是血淋淋的阶级斗争又是什么呢？
    不错，反动阶级看起来也在那里“变”。当着他们受到革命群众的重重包围，处在不利情况的时候，为了保护他们的生存，以利将来的发展，往往会装死躺下，在忍受中求得重生。或者用孙行者钻进肚皮里的战术，打入革命队伍内部，从事反革命活动。或者阳奉阴违，耍两面派，当面给你烧香，背后给你一枪。但是，万变不离其宗。他们千变万变，变的只是对付我们的策略，他们的反动阶级本性是永远不会变的。
    那些惯于变化的敌人，具有更大的危险性。因为他们有一层伪装，容易欺骗一些人。无产阶级文化大革命中，我们就遇到这种惯于变化的阶级敌人。在我担任支左的那个单位，有一个坏分子。他表面上装得一本正经。每当我们扛着红旗，高举红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，去向两派革命群众宣传毛主席最新指示的时候，这个家伙又拿烟又端茶，还连连说：“解放军来向我们宣传毛主席最新指示，真是久旱逢甘雨，欢迎！欢迎！”但是，他在背后却完全是另一套。一会给这一派的头头说：“这个部队对那一派好象很亲热，要注意！”一会又到那一派的群众中去嘀咕：“解放军支持你们，你们同对方搞联合，价钱要高点，不能平起平坐。”等等。他千方百计破坏革命大联合，并且多次挑动武斗。后来，群众起来揭穿了他的“西洋镜”。原来，他是一个对社会主义事业怀有刻骨仇恨的漏网右派分子。
    中国赫鲁晓夫不顾大量活生生的阶级斗争事实，硬说阶级敌人“已经不愿意反抗社会主义了”，这是一个大阴谋。他的目的，就是要我们不要对阶级敌人实行专政，好让他们肆无忌惮地颠覆无产阶级专政，变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政，变社会主义制度为资本主义制度、半封建半殖民地制度。无产阶级专政的强大威力，迫使阶级敌人不得不披上好看的外衣，这正是社会主义条件下，阶级斗争的新特点。我们要牢记毛主席的教导：“善于辨别那些伪装拥护革命而实际反对革命的分子，把他们从我们的各个战线上清洗出去”。我们决不怜惜蛇一样的恶人。对一切反共、反人民、反毛泽东思想的阶级敌人，不管它是大蛇和小蛇，黑蛇和白蛇，露出毒牙的蛇和化成美女的蛇，坚决消灭，绝不手软，誓把社会主义条件下的政治大革命进行到底！
