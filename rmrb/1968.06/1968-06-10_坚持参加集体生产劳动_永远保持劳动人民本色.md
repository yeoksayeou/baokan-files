The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must insist on the system of cadres participating in collective production labor. Our Party and state cadres are ordinary laborers, not overlords riding on the heads of the people." Chairman Mao's great teaching is the fundamental way for leading cadres to carry out ideological revolutionization and never detach themselves from the masses. I have been a cadre for twenty years and deeply feel that: leading cadres can only persist in participating in collective production labor to forever maintain the character of the working people, blend in with the masses, and always stand on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, grasp power for the poor and lower-middle peasants, and use power for them.

I come from a poor peasant family and have been working since I was young. Labor has become a habit. If I don't hold a hoe, my hands feel idle. Since becoming a cadre, whenever there is an opportunity, I participate in labor. Even when inspecting work, I labor wherever I go. The fields and farmlands are my offices. However, for a period, I had this thought: I felt that as a leading cadre, managing a commune's affairs was already busy enough. If I did less labor and focused more on leadership work, wouldn't my contributions be greater? With this thought, I participated less in collective production labor and spent more time in the office. Soon, I noticed that the relationship between the masses and me had changed. Once, I went to the Tan Dian production brigade, and the commune members saw me, all calling me "Comrade Zhang" in a respectful manner. This shocked me. Why did everyone used to call me "Old Zhang" affectionately, and now they call me "Comrade Zhang" respectfully? I thought carefully and realized that the change in the masses' way of addressing me was due to the change in my own thoughts and actions. In the past, wherever I went, I labored with the poor and lower-middle peasants. If the peasants had so much mud on their legs, I had so much mud on mine; if the peasants shed so many drops of sweat, I shed so many drops of sweat. Everyone said I was a genuine farmer, and we had no reservations talking to each other, like a family. However, since I participated less in collective labor, I met the masses less in the fields and farmlands. Sometimes, I would just stand and look in the fields, giving more instructions with my hands and less actual labor. My clothes also became cleaner. The masses said I looked like a "cadre." The more I thought about it, the more I felt the problem was serious. I realized that cadres who detach themselves from labor also detach themselves from the masses. If I was not vigilant, it would be very dangerous. I seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings. Chairman Mao said: "Cadres, through participating in collective production labor, maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest contact with the laboring people. This is a fundamental matter under the socialist system, which helps to overcome bureaucratism, prevent revisionism and dogmatism." Chairman Mao's teachings made me further realize that: whether leading cadres can persist in participating in collective production labor is a matter of whether they can maintain the character of the working people, whether they are ordinary laborers or overlords riding on the heads of the people, and it is a major issue concerning whether our Party and state can forever maintain their red color. The idea of participating less in labor to do more leadership work is opposing participation in production labor to leadership work. In fact, cadres actively participating in collective production labor and establishing close contact with the masses promote their own ideological revolutionization, which is how they can do a good job in leadership work. On the contrary, not participating in labor, not getting down to reality, not connecting with the masses, and relying on meetings and reports in the office not only cannot do a good job in leadership work but also, if this style develops, will cause oneself to degenerate and the proletarian regime to peacefully evolve into a bourgeois regime.

Since then, I have paid more attention to participating in collective production labor. I prepared a set of labor tools for all four seasons and took them wherever I went. Upon arrival, I would put down my bag and start working with the poor and lower-middle peasants. If there was business to attend to, we would discuss it in the fields. My relationship with the masses became even closer. The poor and lower-middle peasants said: "Old Zhang, you are just like us farmers. You haven't lost the character of a farmer, and we trust you."

In February of this year, the revolutionary masses elected me as the head of the commune revolutionary committee and the deputy head of the county agricultural representatives' conference. Every day, I am busy with work and meetings, which objectively brings unfavorable conditions for my participation in collective production labor. I repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great teaching on "insisting on the system of cadres participating in collective production labor," thought about the trust the poor and lower-middle peasants have in me, the responsibility on my shoulders, and the new situation of class struggle, and further realized that: the more the poor and lower-middle peasants trust me, the more I should maintain the character of an ordinary laborer; the heavier the responsibility on my shoulders, the more I should insist on participating in collective production labor and accelerate my own ideological revolutionization; the more complex the class struggle, the more I should consciously go to the masses and, together with the masses, firmly grasp class struggle; at the same time, in labor, thoroughly reform myself and thoroughly eliminate the bourgeois dirt of "officialdom" and "arrogance." No matter how things change, listening to Chairman Mao's words and maintaining the character of the working people can never change. Therefore, I actively create conditions for participating in collective production labor. When time is tight, I plan my work well, squeeze out time to leave the office, and participate in collective production labor with the poor and lower-middle peasants. When staying in the office, I personally do tasks like fetching water, sweeping the yard, and boiling water. I treat participating in collective production labor as an indispensable part of my life.

### 坚持参加集体生产劳动  永远保持劳动人民本色

    坚持参加集体生产劳动  永远保持劳动人民本色
    辽宁省宽甸县农代会第一副主任    永甸人民公社革命委员会主任  张同祥
    伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“必须坚持干部参加集体生产劳动的制度。我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者，而不是骑在人民头上的老爷。”毛主席这一伟大教导，是领导干部搞好思想革命化，永远不脱离群众的根本途径。我当干部二十年了，深深体会到：领导干部只有坚持参加集体生产劳动，才能永远保持劳动人民的本色，和群众打成一片，永远站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上，为贫下中农掌好权，用好权。
    我出身贫农，从小就干活，劳动成了习惯。不摸锄把，手就闲得慌。当干部以来，一有机会我就参加劳动。就是检查工作，也是走到那里，就劳动到那里。田头、地头就是办公室。可是有一段时间，脑子里产生了这么个想法：觉得自己是领导干部，操持一个公社的事，够忙的了。少干点活，把心多往领导工作上用点，贡献不是更大一些吗？有了这种想法，参加集体生产劳动就少了，蹲办公室就多了。不久，我发觉群众和我的关系起了变化。有一次，我到坦甸生产队去，社员见到我，都是张书记长，张书记短地称呼我。这使我大吃一惊。为啥过去大家都亲热地喊我“老张”，现在却很客气地喊我张书记呢？我仔细一想，原来群众对我的称呼的变化，是自己的思想和行动上的变化引起的。过去，走到那里，我就和贫下中农一起劳动。贫下中农腿上有多少泥，我腿上有多少泥；贫下中农掉多少颗汗珠，我也掉多少颗汗珠。大家说我是个地地道道的庄稼人，见面无话不说，没有一点拘束，象一家人一样。可是，打自己参加集体劳动少了，在田头、地头和群众见面也就少了。有时到地里站一站，看一看，指手划脚多，动手动脚干的少。身上也干净起来了。群众说我象个“干部”的样子了。我越想越觉得问题严重，认识到：干部脱离了劳动也就是脱离了群众。自己如果不警惕，是非常危险的。我认真地学习了毛主席的教导。毛主席说：“干部通过参加集体生产劳动，同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系。这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事，它有助于克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义。”毛主席的教导使我进一步认识到：领导干部能不能坚持参加集体生产劳动，是能不能保持劳动人民本色的问题，是当普通劳动者还是当骑在人民头上的老爷的问题，是关系到我们党和国家能不能永远保持鲜红颜色的大问题。所谓少参加点劳动，可以多做点领导工作，这是把参加生产劳动和做领导工作对立起来了。其实，干部积极参加集体生产劳动，同群众建立了密切的联系，促进了自己的思想革命化，才能把领导工作做好。相反，不参加劳动，不深入实际，不联系群众，靠在办公室里开会、听汇报，不仅不能搞好领导工作，而且这种作风发展下去，就会使自己变质，使无产阶级的政权和平演变为资产阶级的政权。
    从那以后，我更加重视参加集体生产劳动。我自备了一年四季所需要的劳动工具，走到那里我带到那里。到了那里，背包一放就和贫下中农一道干起活来。有事就在地头商量。我和群众的关系更加亲密了。贫下中农说：“老张啊，你和我们庄稼人一模一样，庄稼人的本色你没丢掉，我们信得过你。”
    今年二月，革命群众选我当公社革命委员会主任、县农代会的副主任。每天工作、开会忙得很，在客观上给我参加集体生产劳动带来了不利的条件。我反复学习了毛主席关于“必须坚持干部参加集体生产劳动的制度”这一伟大教导，联想到贫下中农对自己的信任、自己肩上的责任和阶级斗争的新形势，进一步认识到：贫下中农对自己越是信任，自己越要保持普通劳动者的本色；肩上的责任越重，越要坚持参加集体生产劳动，加速自己的思想革命化；阶级斗争越复杂，越要自觉地到群众中去，和群众一起狠抓阶级斗争；同时，在劳动中彻底地改造自己，彻底清除“官”气、“骄”气等资产阶级的脏东西。千变万变，听毛主席的话，保持劳动人民的本色永远不能变。于是，我积极为参加集体生产劳动创造条件。时间紧，我就把工作计划好，挤出时间走出办公室，和贫下中农一起参加集体生产劳动。留在办公室的时候，打水、扫院子、烧水等工作，我都亲自干。把参加集体生产劳动，作为生活中不可缺少的内容。
