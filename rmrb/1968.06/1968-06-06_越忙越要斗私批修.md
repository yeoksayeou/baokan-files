	The Busier, the More Important It Is to Criticize and Repudiate Revisionism
		Study Group Member of Mao Zedong Thought, Red Military Camp Militia, Li Zhongcai

	“Revisionism” is a boil, “self-interest” is the root. If you lance the boil but don’t remove the root, the boil will reappear after it is lanced.

	Once the busy agricultural season arrives, the “self-interest” that usually hides deep in the mind is most likely to come out and show itself, combining with the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev.

	Last summer during the harvest, the brigade decided to concentrate all the labor force to first rush the collective wheat harvest. My family’s private plot was right next to the brigade’s wheat field. While harvesting the brigade’s wheat, I could see it with just a glance. Seeing the wheat in the private plot that had not yet been harvested, my mind was like a boiling pot of porridge, churning away. I thought, if I first harvested the private plot and then the brigade’s, that would be great! At that moment, the images of Zhang Zide and Norman Bethune flashed through my mind, and I heard Chairman Mao’s teachings: “To regard the interests of the revolution as one’s first and foremost life, and to subordinate personal interests to the interests of the revolution.” I immediately felt that the thought that had just appeared was the “self-interest” rearing its head. This was exactly falling into the trap of the Chinese Khrushchev’s “personal interests must be taken care of, without personal interests there can be no collective interests” theory of “public-private combination.” If everyone did as I initially thought, first busy with the private plot, then the collective wheat would wither and the loss would not be even greater? Wouldn’t this fall into the trap of the Chinese Khrushchev? The more I thought about it, the more dangerous I felt the previous thought was. So, in the field criticism meeting, I exposed the selfishness that had just surfaced and criticized the Chinese Khrushchev’s “public-private combination” theory. In this way, although the private plot’s wheat was harvested a few days later, I felt very happy because I had won a battle in the struggle against selfishness and revisionism!

	Why is it that the busier the production, the more important it is to struggle against selfishness and repudiate revisionism? The reason is simple: who are you busy for? For self-interest or for the public interest? For yourself or for the revolution? When you are busy, if you relax the struggle against selfishness and revisionism, the “self-interest” will rise up, and capitalism will spread. If socialism is relaxed, capitalism will attack. The Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplices’ black goods of “material incentives,” “three freedoms and one contract,” and “four freedoms” will use the “self-interest” in our minds to “revive through borrowing,” which is very dangerous!

	Chairman Mao teaches us: “We must struggle against selfishness and repudiate revisionism.” Vice Chairman Lin says: “Big things and small things, collective things and personal things, public things and private things, the two sides are engaged in a tug-of-war, one side gains while the other side loses, the other side gains while this side loses.” We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fiercely struggle against selfishness, and vigorously repudiate revisionism. We must spark a revolution in the depths of our souls, launch a “close combat” struggle against selfishness and revisionism, and thoroughly smash the Chinese Khrushchev’s plot to use selfishness to restore capitalism.

### 越忙越要斗私批修

    越忙越要斗私批修
    学习毛主席著作积极分子  红武大队民兵营基干民兵  李忠才
    “修”是脓包“私”是根，挑掉脓包不除根，前头挑了后头生。
    一到农忙，平时躲在头脑深处的“私”字最容易跑出来“亮相”，和中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义的谬论搞“两结合”。
    去年夏收大忙时，队里决定，集中所有劳力先抢收集体的麦子。我家自留地就紧挨着队里的麦田，在队里割麦，一抬头就看得见。眼看着自留地的麦子，还没有收割，我脑子里就象烧开了的粥锅那样翻腾开来。心想，要是先收了自留地的再收队里的，该多好！就在这个时候，脑子里立刻闪现出张思德、白求恩的光辉形象，耳边响起了毛主席“以革命利益为第一生命，以个人利益服从革命利益”的教导，我马上感到，刚才出现的那种想法，就是“私”字冒头，这正是中了中国赫鲁晓夫“个人利益一定要照顾，没有个人利益即无整体利益”的“大公有私”论的毒。如果大家都象我原来想的那样去做，先忙着收自留地的，那集体的麦子枯掉损失不是更大吗？这不就上了中国赫鲁晓夫的当？越想，越觉得刚才的想法危险。于是，我在田头批判会上，亮了刚刚冒出头的私心，批了中国赫鲁晓夫的“大公有私”论。这样，虽然自留地的麦子晚收了几天，但心里感到很痛快，因为我在斗私批修中打了一个胜仗！
    为什么生产越忙，越要斗私批修？道理很简单，你忙，为谁忙？为私还是为公？为自己还是为革命？忙的时候，放松斗私批修，私字就要抬头，资本主义就要泛滥。社会主义松一松，资本主义攻一攻，中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙的“物质刺激”、“三自一包”、“四大自由”等黑货，就又会利用我们头脑里的“私”字，“借私还魂”，这是多么危险呵！
    毛主席教导我们：“要斗私，批修”。林副主席说：“大事和小事，集体的事和个人的事，公事和私事，两个方面互相展开争夺战，此长彼消，彼长此消。”我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠斗私字，猛批修字，在灵魂深处爆发革命，开展斗私批修的“白刃战”，彻底粉碎中国赫鲁晓夫利用私字复辟资本主义的阴谋。
