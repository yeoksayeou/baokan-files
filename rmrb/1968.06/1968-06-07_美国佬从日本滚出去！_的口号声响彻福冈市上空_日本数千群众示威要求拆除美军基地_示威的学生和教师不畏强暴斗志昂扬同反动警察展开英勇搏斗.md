"The 'Yankee, Get Out of Japan!' slogans echoed through the skies of Fukuoka City. Thousands of Japanese demonstrators demanded the dismantling of U.S. military bases. Students and teachers, undaunted by violence, bravely fought against reactionary police."

According to a report by the New China News Agency on June 6, the Oriental News Agency reported: Over 1,500 patriotic students, citizens, and members of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) in Fukuoka Prefecture held a rally and demonstration in front of the U.S. Air Force's Itazuke Base on the evening of June 5. They strongly protested against U.S. imperialism's use of its bases in Japan to invade Vietnam and resolutely demanded the dismantling of U.S. military bases.

The reactionary Sato government mobilized over 300 armed police to suppress the demonstration. The spirited demonstrators engaged in a two-hour fierce struggle with the reactionary police in front of a bridge near the Itazuke Base. They chanted slogans such as "Immediately dismantle the Itazuke Base!" "Abolish the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty'!" and "Yankee, Get Out of Japan!"

Members of the Fukuoka branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) held up two red flags with the inscriptions "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought!" and "Long Live the Unity of the Peoples of China and Japan!" and participated in the protest demonstration.

Before the struggle with the reactionary police, the demonstrators held a rally. Representatives from various organizations and citizens spoke at the rally, angrily protesting the crime of a U.S. combat bomber crashing into Kyushu University in Fukuoka City. They strongly demanded the dismantling of U.S. military bases in Japan and the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

Matsuno Otake, the secretary of the Fukuoka branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), said at the rally: The U.S. imperialist military bases in Japan are not only bases for invading Vietnam but also an important part of their military deployment against China. We, the Japanese people, must strengthen the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan and struggle to abolish the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and dismantle U.S. military bases.

According to a report by the New China News Agency in Tokyo on June 5, the anti-U.S. struggle of the people of Fukuoka City, protesting the crash of a U.S. gangster plane that burned down buildings at Kyushu University, is continuing to develop.

On the afternoon and evening of June 4, thousands of students, teachers, and citizens of Kyushu University held multiple rallies and demonstrations, strongly demanding the immediate dismantling of the U.S. Air Force's Itazuke Base. Slogans such as "Yankee, Get Out of Japan!" and "Abolish the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty'!" echoed through Fukuoka City.

That afternoon, over 4,000 students from Kyushu University also held a demonstration in front of the U.S. Consulate and engaged in a fierce struggle with the reactionary armed police who came to suppress them.

President Mizuno Takamasa of Kyushu University and over 300 professors and staff participated in this anti-U.S. demonstration. The broad masses of Fukuoka City enthusiastically supported the students' brave struggle and the teachers' demonstration.

In this struggle, the revisionist group led by Miyamoto of the Japanese Communist Party once again slandered the patriotic students and plotted to confine the people's anti-U.S. patriotic struggle within their framework of legalism and parliamentary road, serving the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. However, the Japanese people broke through those revisionist rules and increasingly saw through the counter-revolutionary face of the Miyamoto revisionist group in the struggle.

On the evening of June 2, about 1,000 students and citizens of Kyushu University, despite police obstruction, surrounded a U.S. military police car and angrily protested against the U.S. gangster planes' rampant behavior in Japan.

    日本数千群众示威要求拆除美军基地
    示威的学生和教师不畏强暴斗志昂扬同反动警察展开英勇搏斗
    据新华社六日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本福冈县爱国学生、市民和日中友好协会（正统）会员一千五百多人，五日晚在美国空军板付基地前举行集会和示威，强烈抗议美帝国主义利用它在日本的基地侵略越南的罪行，坚决要求拆除美军基地。
    佐藤反动政府调动三百多名武装警察进行镇压。斗志昂扬的示威者在板付基地前面的一座桥上，同反动警察进行了两小时的英勇搏斗。他们高呼：“立即拆除板付基地！”“废除日美‘安全条约’！”和“美国佬从日本滚出去！”等口号。
    日中友好协会（正统）福冈支部的会员，高举两面写着“毛泽东思想万岁！”和“日中两国人民团结万岁！”的红旗参加了抗议示威。
    示威者在同反动警察展开搏斗前举行了集会。与会的各团体和市民的代表在集会上讲了话，愤怒抗议美国战斗轰炸机坠落在福冈市的九州大学的罪行。他们强烈要求拆除在日本的美国军事基地，要求废除日美“安全条约”。
    日中友好协会（正统）福冈支部事务局长松野尾竹子在集会上说：美帝国主义设在日本的军事基地不仅是它侵略越南的基地，而且是敌视中国的军事部署中的重要部分。我们日本人民必须加强日中两国人民的战斗友谊，为废除日美“安全条约”和拆除美军基地而斗争。
    据新华社东京五日电　日本福冈市人民抗议美国强盗飞机坠落焚毁九州大学建筑物的反美斗争，正在继续发展。
    四日下午和晚上，几千名九州大学的学生、教师和福冈市民多次举行集会和示威游行，强烈要求立即拆除美国空军板付基地。“美国佬从日本滚出去！”“废除日美‘安全条约’！”等反美口号，响彻福冈市。
    这天下午，九州大学学生四千多人还到美国领事馆门前举行了示威游行，并同前来镇压他们的反动武装警察展开了英勇的搏斗。
    九州大学校长水野高明同三百多名教授和职员参加了这次反美示威。福冈市广大市民热烈支持学生的英勇斗争和教师们的示威游行。
    日共宫本修正主义集团在这场斗争中又一次诽谤爱国学生，并策划把群众的反美爱国斗争纳入他们的合法主义和议会道路的框框里，为美日反动派效劳。但是，日本人民冲破了那些修正主义的清规戒律，并在斗争中越来越清楚地看穿了宫本修正主义集团的反革命面目。（附图片）
