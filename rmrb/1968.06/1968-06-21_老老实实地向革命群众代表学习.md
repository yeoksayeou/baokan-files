I participated in the revolutionary "three-in-one" leadership team and worked with revolutionary mass representatives. During this time, I deeply understood the great significance of Chairman Mao's teaching: "In a certain sense, the most intelligent and most capable are the soldiers with the most practical experience." This has given me great enlightenment and profound education.

One day, the main transformer at the power station was damaged due to a circuit fault, causing a power outage throughout the factory. The situation was urgent. We immediately convened the production responsible cadres and engineering and technical personnel to discuss the issue. The main transformer was damaged and needed to be replaced, but entering through the east gate was not possible, and entering through the west gate would cause a wider range of power outages. What should we do? Everyone argued without a conclusion. At this time, revolutionary mass representative Comrade Xiao Dong said, "Chairman Mao teaches us that the masses are the real heroes. What's the use of just sitting in the office and arguing? In my opinion, we should go to the scene and discuss with the masses. The solution will naturally come." Saying this, he led the way out of the office, and everyone followed. Upon arriving at the scene and discussing with the workers, everyone offered suggestions and ideas. It was decided to demolish the back wall near the road and push the transformer in, then repair the wall. Using this method, the production that was originally estimated to take fifteen hours to resume was restored in just over seven hours.

Afterward, I deeply felt that I said to Xiao Dong, "You really have a way, it seems that this method cannot be thought of by sitting in the office." Xiao Dong said, "This is not a matter of method, but whether to fully trust the masses or only trust oneself." At that time, I did not fully understand this, so another incident occurred. In April, when discussing the production plan, based on the supply of parts and raw materials, I thought that only twenty-eight locomotive repairs could be arranged. However, Xiao Dong insisted on arranging thirty-five, reasoning that the broad masses, through criticizing the "class struggle extinction" theory of the Chinese Khrushchev, had greatly improved their ideological awareness, and political power could overcome material difficulties. In the revolutionary committee meeting, everyone agreed to do thirty-five, but I was still not at ease. As a result, our factory completed the task ahead of schedule in April.

These two incidents deeply educated me and made me think of many problems. I joined the revolution in 1938 and have been the factory director for many years. It seems that whether in revolution or production, I have more experience than the revolutionary youngsters. However, why am I lagging behind? The key is that when dealing with problems, I trust myself, not like Comrade Xiao Dong, who sees the masses. With this question in mind, I studied Chairman Mao's teachings and found that the reason I could not correctly treat the masses was that deep in my soul, two words had not been eradicated: "old" and "official." Whenever there is an opportunity, they will surface, always feeling that I am a "Model 38" and a "factory director." Therefore, I look down on the masses and young people. If I do not, with the help of the revolutionary masses, uproot these two seeds of detachment from the masses, it will be very dangerous to continue. In the future, I will constantly struggle against the "old" and "official" in my mind. When encountering problems, I will first go to the masses to be a student or invite the masses to discuss together. To ensure the production and heating needs for this winter, we originally decided to build a new boiler plant for the power workshop. However, upon comparing it with Chairman Mao's instruction to "further economize and make revolution," we felt it was not right. What should we do? I had no solution at the time. Then, I went to the masses, called the responsible person of the power workshop revolutionary committee to the boiler class, and discussed with the workers. Finally, we came up with a good solution that both conforms to the principle of economizing and making revolution and ensures production and heating. Now, studying Chairman Mao's teaching that "the masses are the real heroes" feels even more intimate, and I have a deeper understanding of why Chairman Mao, in the basic experience of the revolutionary committee, affirms that "one is the representative of the revolutionary masses." To maintain revolutionary integrity, I will honestly learn from the revolutionary mass representatives, humbly be a student of the masses, always maintain close ties with the masses, and always follow the great leader Chairman Mao to the end of the revolution.

    老老实实地向革命群众代表学习
    原济南机车工厂厂长济南机车工厂革命委员会常委  于风银
    我参加革命的“三结合”领导班子，在同革命群众代表一起工作期间，使自己进一步体会到伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士”的伟大意义。给自己的启发很大，教育很深。
    有一天，配电站的主变压器因线路故障损坏，造成全厂停电，情况很紧急。我们立刻召集负责生产的干部和工程技术人员研究，主变压器坏了，要更换一个，但是走东门进不去，走西门会造成更大范围的停电。究竟怎么办好？大家争论不休，这时革命群众代表小董同志说：毛主席教导我们，群众是真正的英雄，咱们光坐在办公室里吵吵有什么用，依我看，咱们应当到现场去，同群众一起商量，办法自然会有的。说着他就带头走出了办公室，大家也跟着走了。赶到现场，和工人一起商量，大家出主意想办法，决定把靠大路边的后墙扒开，将变压器推进来，然后再补墙。采用这个办法，原来预计要十五个小时才能恢复生产，结果只用了七个多小时就恢复了全厂的生产。
    事后，我深有感触地对小董说：“你真有办法，看来坐在办公室里是想不出这个办法的”。小董说：“这不是方法问题，是充分相信群众，还是仅仅相信自己的问题。”我当时对这一点理解不深，因此又发生了下边一件事。四月份研究生产计划时，根据配件和原材料的供应情况，我认为只能安排二十八台机车修理任务，小董却认定要安排三十五台，理由是广大群众通过批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，思想觉悟有了很大提高，政治上的力量足以战胜物质上的困难。在革委会会议上讨论，大家都同意搞三十五台，而我还是放不下心。结果四月份我厂提前完成了任务。
    这两件事深深地教育了我，使我想起了很多问题。我一九三八年参加革命，当了多年厂长，按说不论搞革命，还是抓生产都比革命小将有经验，可是为什么落后了呢？关键在于我处理问题时，相信的是自己，不象小董同志那样，看到的是群众。带着这个问题，我学习了毛主席有关教导，发现自己所以长期不能正确对待群众，是由于灵魂深处有两个字没有铲除，一个是“老”字，一个是“官”字，一有机会它们就要露头，总感觉自己是什么“三八式”的，是“厂长”。因而看不起群众，看不起年轻人。如果不在革命群众的帮助下挖掉这两根脱离群众的苗子，发展下去是很危险的。以后，我不断地向头脑中的“老”和“官”字斗争，遇到问题时，先到群众中去当小学生或把群众请来共同研究。为了保证今年冬季生产和取暖的需要，我们原来决定给动力车间新建一座锅炉厂房，可是一对照毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的指示，又感到不对头，怎么办？一时没有办法。这时，我便到群众中去，把动力车间革委会的负责人也叫到锅炉班，同工人一起商量，最后，终于想出了一个既符合节约闹革命的原则又能保证生产和取暖的好办法。现在，学习毛主席“群众是真正的英雄”这个教导，就感到更加亲切，进一步理解了毛主席为什么在革命委员会的基本经验中，要肯定“一条是有革命群众的代表”。为了保持革命的晚节，我要老老实实地向革命群众代表学习，虚心地做群众的小学生，永远密切联系群众，永远紧跟伟大统帅毛主席革命到底。
