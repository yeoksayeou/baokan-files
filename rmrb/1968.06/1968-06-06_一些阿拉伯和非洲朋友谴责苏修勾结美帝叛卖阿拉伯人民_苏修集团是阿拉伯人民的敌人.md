On the one-year anniversary of the U.S. imperialists instigating their tool, Israel, to launch an invasion against Arab countries, some Arab and African friends have unanimously condemned the Soviet revisionist traitors' collusion with U.S. imperialism and betrayal of the Arab people during this invasion.

A friend from the United Arab Republic told a reporter from the Xinhua News Agency's Cairo bureau, "The Soviet revisionists claim to be friends of the Arab people, but in reality, they have been betraying the Arab people. Before the U.S. and Israel launched their invasion against Arab countries last June, the Soviet revisionists lulled us into a false sense of security. During the war, they not only stood idly by but also, after Israel gained a military advantage, they conspired with the United States to orchestrate the so-called 'ceasefire' that Israel needed. After the June War, they pressured the Arab people to accept the so-called 'political solution' in collusion with U.S. imperialism. All this shows that the Soviet revisionists are enemies of the Arab people, not their friends."

An Algerian veteran condemned the Soviet revisionists' betrayal of the Palestinian people, saying, "The Soviet leaders talk about solving the Palestinian issue within the framework of the United Nations and about caring for peace in the Middle East, which is all nonsense. This is a political trick they play with the United States."

A friend from Sudan wrote to the Xinhua News Agency's Khartoum bureau, saying, "During the U.S.-Israeli invasion of Arab countries, the Arab people discovered that the Soviet revisionist leadership is a false friend. They verbally support the struggle of the Arab people, but at critical moments, they not only avoid involvement but also cooperate with imperialists. The Soviet revisionist leadership has betrayed the just cause of the Arab people. Our task is to fight against revisionism and imperialism."

A Sudanese student wrote in an article about Middle Eastern events, "At this time last year, Israel, instigated by U.S. imperialism and aided by the false friend of the Arab people, the Soviet revisionists, launched an invasion. Under the pretext of 'peace' and 'peaceful transition,' the Soviet revisionists betrayed the cause of the Arab people."

He wrote, "The world revolutionary situation is excellent. The revolutionary people of the world, holding high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, are destroying the imperialist fortresses and engaging in anti-revisionist struggles. The fight against imperialism must be combined with the fight against revisionism because revisionism and imperialism are two partners aiming to dominate the world."

He also wrote, "The revolutionary Arab people should take action, arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought to defeat imperialism. No matter how the Soviet revisionists deceive the Arab people, the Arab people will eventually see through the Soviet revisionists' true, treacherous faces."

The head of the Palestine Liberation Organization's office in Khartoum, Said Saber, told a Xinhua News Agency reporter in Khartoum, "Solving the Palestinian issue through 'negotiations' is an empty promise. The only path for the Palestinian people and the Arab people to liberation is armed struggle."

A friend from Botswana said, "Last June's U.S.-Israeli invasion exposed the true nature of U.S. imperialism and its accomplice, the Soviet revisionists. The people of the world saw how the Soviet modern revisionists, under the guise of so-called 'aid' and 'peaceful coexistence,' betrayed the Arab people and their cause."

### 一些阿拉伯和非洲朋友谴责苏修勾结美帝叛卖阿拉伯人民  苏修集团是阿拉伯人民的敌人

    一些阿拉伯和非洲朋友谴责苏修勾结美帝叛卖阿拉伯人民
    苏修集团是阿拉伯人民的敌人
    据新华社五日讯　在美帝国主义策动它的侵略工具以色列向阿拉伯国家发动侵略战争一周年的时候，一些阿拉伯和非洲朋友同声谴责苏修叛徒集团在这场侵略战争中，勾结美帝，叛卖阿拉伯人民的罪恶行径。
    一位阿联朋友对新华社驻开罗分社记者说，苏联修正主义者宣称，他们是阿拉伯人民的“朋友”，但是他们实际上一直在出卖阿拉伯人民。在去年六月美以对阿拉伯国家发动侵略战争的前夕，苏修麻痹了我们的警惕性。在战争期间，他们不仅袖手旁观，而且当以色列在军事上处于有利的地位之后，它又伙同美国策划了以色列所需要的所谓“停火”。六月战争之后，它又伙同美帝逼迫阿拉伯人民接受所谓“政治解决”。这一切表明，苏修是阿拉伯人民的敌人，而不是什么“朋友”。
    一位阿尔及利亚老战士谴责苏修出卖巴勒斯坦人民的罪行时说：“苏联的领导人说什么巴勒斯坦问题应该在联合国的范围内解决，说什么他们关心中东的和平，这完全是一派胡言。这是他们和美国一起耍的政治花招。”
    苏丹一位朋友写信给新华社驻喀土穆分社说，在美以对阿拉伯国家的侵略中，阿拉伯人民发现苏修领导集团是假朋友，他们在口头上装作支持阿拉伯人民的斗争，但在关键的时候，他们就不仅避开而且同帝国主义者合作。苏修领导集团出卖了阿拉伯人民的正义事业。我们的任务是同修正主义和帝国主义作斗争。
    苏丹一位学生在他写的一篇有关中东事件的文章中指出，去年这个时候，以色列在美帝的唆使下和在阿拉伯人民的假朋友苏修的帮助下，发动了侵略战争。苏修在“和平”和“和平过渡”的幌子下，背叛了阿拉伯人民的事业。
    他写道：“世界革命形势是大好的，世界革命人民高举马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，正在摧毁帝国主义的堡垒和进行反修斗争。反帝必须与反修斗争结合起来，因为修正主义和帝国主义是企图主宰世界的两个同伙。”
    他还写道，革命的阿拉伯人民应当行动起来，为了打败帝国主义，要用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑。他在文章中指出，不管苏修怎样欺骗阿拉伯人民，阿拉伯人民终将认清苏修丑恶的叛徒真面目。
    巴勒斯坦解放组织驻喀土穆办事处主任赛义德·赛勃尔在喀土穆对新华社记者发表谈话说，通过“和谈”来解决巴勒斯坦问题是一句空话。巴勒斯坦人民和阿拉伯人民争取解放的唯一道路就是武装斗争。
    博茨瓦纳一位朋友说：“去年六月美以侵略战争暴露了美帝国主义及其帮凶苏修的本质。全世界人民看穿了苏联现代修正主义者如何用所谓‘援助’和‘和平共处’的伪装，出卖了阿拉伯人民和他们的事业。”
