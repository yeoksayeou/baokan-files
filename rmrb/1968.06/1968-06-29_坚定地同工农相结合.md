Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "How do we judge whether a young person is revolutionary or not? What is the criterion? There is only one criterion, that is, to see whether they are willing to and actually do unite with the broad masses of workers and peasants." Chairman Mao's teachings are our guiding light for progress. The Chinese Khrushchev, in order to cultivate bourgeois successors, sings a different tune from Chairman Mao. Under the pretext of caring for the future of the youth, he sweet-talks: "I advise you, after returning to the countryside, not to become cadres, but to seriously farm for three to five years. By then, you will have learned all the farming work, and anything a peasant can do, you can do... You have culture... Plus one more condition, that is, to have a good relationship with the masses, possessing these three conditions, you can become a cadre at the county, provincial, or even central level, it all depends on your personal abilities." This is not about caring for the youth's future; it is clearly about wanting us to farm in the countryside for a few years, deceiving us into getting the title of "peasant" as capital to climb up. This is a typical bourgeois philosophy of "suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage," attempting to seduce us away from the workers and peasants, making us his vanguard for restoring capitalism. It is extremely evil and thoroughly reactionary!

Chairman Mao calls on us: "All such intellectuals who can go to the countryside to work should happily go there. The countryside is a vast world where one can achieve great things." In 1957, after graduating from junior high school, I responded to Chairman Mao's call to action, broke through my family's numerous obstacles, left the city, and settled in Xiyouying Production Brigade. Over the past ten years, the sharp and complex class struggle and arduous production struggle have constantly tested every young person who went to the countryside. In 1960, during a period of temporary economic difficulties in our country, someone said to me: "Foolish girl, others are running from the countryside to the city, why do you insist on running from the city to the countryside? Go back!" At that time, life was indeed very hard. If I had followed the Chinese Khrushchev's bourgeois philosophy of "suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage," then since I couldn't become a cadre, I should have quickly returned to the city to find another way. At this moment, I remembered Chairman Mao's teachings about young intellectuals uniting with the workers and peasants. Chairman Mao's earnest teachings made me even more determined to follow the revolutionary path of uniting with the workers and peasants to the end. What is there to fear in suffering for the revolution! When carrying a burden, my shoulders were rubbed raw, and when transplanting seedlings, my back ached, but I thought of laboring for all the people of China and the world, and I felt infinite happiness. In my shared life with the poor and lower-middle peasants, my non-proletarian thoughts were constantly being transformed.

In 1965, the Chinese Khrushchev's agent in the cultural circle of Tianjin came to me several times to "open my mind." He hypocritically said: "You cannot stay in Xiyouying for long; you should take on heavier responsibilities and show the prowess of young intellectuals." What he meant by "showing the prowess of young intellectuals" was to make us leave the workers and peasants and take the capitalist road of personal fame and fortune. At that time, should I continue to stay in Xiyouying or not? My thoughts were in fierce struggle. I opened the red book "The Direction of the Youth Movement" and studied it word by word. Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts once again illuminated my path forward and strengthened my resolve to forever unite with the workers and peasants. Revolutionary youth armed with Mao Zedong Thought are bound to achieve great things. Our achievement is to strive for communism all our lives, to be loyal to the revolution with all our hearts, to dedicate our red hearts to the people, and to wholeheartedly serve the people of China and the world.

In 1964, at a critical moment in the struggle between the two classes and two roads in Xiyouying, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Zhou Yang also came to Xiyouying, saying that we should "learn more knowledge," trying to lure us away from the fiery class struggle. But the wings of a crow can never block the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought! I followed Chairman Mao's great teaching of "enduring hardships and experiencing life" and united with the poor and lower-middle peasants to engage in a fierce life-and-death struggle against the class enemies, achieving great victories. After the Cultural Revolution began, a handful of capitalist roaders within the local party, because I had fought them resolutely together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, saw me as a thorn in their eye and a bone in their throat. They used every means to slander, attack, and persecute me. I thought of our red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, and gained limitless courage and strength. Together with the revolutionary masses, after arduous struggles, we defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and smashed the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the countryside's plot to restore capitalism.

The Chinese Khrushchev attempted to poison us with bourgeois ideas of fame and wealth and persecute us with fascist atrocities, making us detach from proletarian politics and the workers and peasants, but it will not work, it will never work! Now, our brigade, with the help of the People's Liberation Army 4704 Unit, further launched the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, carrying the revolutionary criticism to the end. We revolutionary youth resolutely advance along the path of uniting with the workers and peasants as indicated by Chairman Mao, forever loyally to Chairman Mao, loyally to Mao Zedong Thought, loyally to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and vow to be reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

    坚定地同工农相结合
    天津市小站地区西右营大队下乡知识青年　酆玉娥
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席指出：“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。”毛主席这一教导，是我们青年前进的指路明灯。中国赫鲁晓夫为了培养资产阶级接班人，同毛主席大唱反调。他打起关心青年前途的幌子，甜言蜜语地说：“我劝你们回乡后不当干部，认真地种三五年地。到那时，一切农活都学会了，农民能做的事，你们都能做……你们有文化……再加上一条跟群众关系搞得好，具备三条就能当乡、县、省干部，也可以到中央，那就看个人的本事了。”这哪里是关心青年的前途，分明是要我们下乡种几年地，骗得“农民”的称号，作为向上爬的资本。这是地地道道的“吃小亏，占大便宜”的资产阶级市侩哲学，妄图诱骗我们背离工农群众，充当他搞资本主义复辟的马前卒。真是恶毒之极，反动透顶！
    毛主席号召我们：“一切可以到农村中去工作的这样的知识分子，应当高兴地到那里去。农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的。”一九五七年我初中毕业后，响应毛主席这一战斗号令，冲破家庭的重重阻拦，离开城市，来到西右营大队安家落户。十年来，尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，艰苦的生产斗争，无时不在考验着每个下乡青年。一九六○年我国经济暂时困难时期，有人对我说：“傻丫头，人家从乡下往城里跑，你为什么偏要从城里往乡下跑，回去吧！”当时，生活的确很艰苦，如果按照中国赫鲁晓夫“吃小亏，占大便宜”的市侩哲学，那末我既然当不成干部，就应该赶快进城另找门路了。正在这时，我记起了毛主席关于知识青年必须同工农群众相结合的教导。毛主席的谆谆教导，使我更加坚定了沿着同工农群众相结合的革命道路走到底的雄心壮志。为革命吃苦有何所惧！挑担时肩磨破了，栽秧时腰弯疼了，但是我一想到这是为全中国、全世界人民而劳动，就感到无限的幸福。我在同贫下中农的共同生活中，也使自己的非无产阶级思想不断地得到改造。
    一九六五年，中国赫鲁晓夫在天津文化界的代理人，又多次来找我“打通思想”。他假惺惺地说什么：“你不能久居西右营，要挑更重的担子，发挥知识青年的作为呀。”他所说的“发挥知识青年的作为”，就是要我们脱离工农群众，走个人成名成家的资本主义邪路。当时，要不要继续留在西右营呢？思想上展开了激烈的斗争。我翻开红彤彤的宝书《青年运动的方向》，一字一句地学习。毛主席的光辉思想再一次照亮了我前进的道路，坚定了我永远同工农相结合的决心。用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命青年是要有作为的。我们的作为就是为实现共产主义而奋斗终生，就是一片忠心为革命，掏尽红心为人民，完全彻底地为中国人民和世界人民服务。
    一九六四年，正当西右营两个阶级、两条道路斗争的关键时刻，反革命修正主义分子周扬也来到西右营，说什么“要多学点知识”，诱骗我们离开火热的阶级斗争。但是，乌鸦的翅膀哪能遮得住毛泽东思想的阳光！我遵照毛主席“经风雨，见世面”的伟大教导，同贫下中农团结在一起，对阶级敌人进行了激烈的生死搏斗，取得了很大的胜利。文化大革命开始以后，当地党内一小撮走资派，因为我和贫下中农一起向他们进行过坚决的斗争，把我看成眼中钉，肉中刺。他们千方百计地对我进行污蔑、打击和迫害。我想起我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，就有了无限的勇气和力量。我同广大革命群众一起，经过艰苦的斗争，保卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在农村的代理人复辟资本主义的阴谋。
    中国赫鲁晓夫妄图用资产阶级的名利思想来毒害我们，用法西斯暴行来迫害我们，使我们脱离无产阶级政治，脱离工农群众，办不到，永远办不到！现在，我们大队在人民解放军四七○四部队的帮助下，进一步开展了活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，把革命的大批判进行到底。我们革命青年坚决沿着毛主席指引的同工农群众相结合的道路奋勇前进，永远无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，誓做无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人。
