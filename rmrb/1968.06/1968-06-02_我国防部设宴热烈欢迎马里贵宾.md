The Malian military delegation, at the invitation, is visiting China for a friendly visit.

China's Ministry of Defense holds a banquet to warmly welcome the Malian guests.

General Chief of Staff Huang Yongsheng said that recently, the Johnson administration, while intensifying the war of aggression against Vietnam, has also, in close collaboration with modern revisionism, been hastening the "peace talks" charade, attempting to snatch from the negotiating table what it cannot obtain on the battlefield. However, all these efforts are in vain and will absolutely not save its total failure in the war of aggression against Vietnam.

Team leader Mamadou Diakit said, we are closely following the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has sparked a good response among revolutionary people around the world, and it achieves greater victories every day.

BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) – The Ministry of National Defense held a banquet tonight to warmly welcome the Malian military delegation led by Mamadou Diakit, Minister of Defense and Security of the Republic of Mali.

General Chief of Staff Huang Yongsheng and Mamadou Diakit both spoke at the banquet, expressing their wishes for the continuous growth of solidarity and friendship between the peoples and armed forces of China and Mali.

Comrade Huang Yongsheng said, amidst the triumphant songs of our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we are very pleased to have the Malian military delegation led by Minister Mamadou Diakit visiting our country for a friendly visit. On behalf of our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, on behalf of the Ministry of National Defense and all the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, we extend a warm welcome to the Malian guests.

Comrade Huang Yongsheng praised the Malian people for their glorious tradition of anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggle, for making active contributions to the cause of Asian and African people's unity against imperialism, and sincerely wished the Malian people, under the leadership of President Keita, continuous new victories on their forward march.

Comrade Huang Yongsheng talked about the excellent situation of armed struggle against imperialism by the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. He said, our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "We are now in a new and great era of world revolution. The revolutionary storms in Asia, Africa, and Latin America will inevitably deliver a decisive and destructive blow to the entire old world." He said, the heroic Vietnamese people, in their great war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation, have already beaten the American imperialists into a corner, making them desperate and pathetic. Recently, the Johnson administration, while intensifying the war of aggression against Vietnam, has also, in close collaboration with modern revisionism, been hastening the "peace talks" charade, attempting to snatch from the negotiating table what it cannot obtain on the battlefield. However, all these efforts are in vain and will absolutely not save its total failure in the war of aggression against Vietnam. No force in the world can stop the victorious advance of the heroic Vietnamese people and the broad masses of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

Comrade Huang Yongsheng said, now, in the United States and Europe, a great revolutionary storm of unprecedented scale is rising. The black people's struggle against violence in the United States and the revolutionary struggles of French workers and students are prominent manifestations of this great storm's arrival. This is a major symbol of the deepening and intensifying of contradictions within the capitalist world. It makes imperialism, with the United States at its head, more internally and externally besieged, crisis-ridden, and in an extremely difficult situation. Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out in his statement supporting the black people's struggle against violence in the United States: "It can be said with certainty that the thorough collapse of colonialism, imperialism, and all systems of exploitation, and the thorough liberation of all oppressed peoples and nations, is not far off."

He said, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao in our country is advancing rapidly towards all-round victory. The Malian people, the African people, and revolutionary people all over the world have given enthusiastic support and encouragement to our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The great victory of our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has also given great support and encouragement to the revolutionary struggles of all the peoples of the world.

He pointed out that we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. The Chinese people, tempered by this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will certainly more effectively support the revolutionary struggles of all the peoples of the world, support the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and better fulfill our internationalist duties.

Mamadou Diakit then spoke at the banquet. On behalf of the Malian people led by President Modibo Keita, he expressed friendly regards to the great Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong.

He said, we are closely following the unprecedented revolution in your great country, that is, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao Zedong.

Mamadou Diakit pointed out that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has sparked a good response among revolutionary people all over the world, and it achieves greater victories every day. We are very happy to be able to come to China to see this cultural revolution with our own eyes. He thanked the Chinese people for the enthusiastic and revolutionary-spirited welcome given to the delegation.

Mamadou Diakit wished the People's Liberation Army, directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin Biao, greater and greater achievements.

Attending the banquet were various responsible comrades from the various headquarters, various military branches, and relevant departments of the People's Liberation Army, and the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, such as Xiao Jingguang and Li Tianyou, as well as representatives from the army, navy, and air force of the People's Liberation Army, and representatives from the capital's militia and Red Guards.

The acting chargé d'affaires of the Malian Embassy in China, Mussa Kuribali, and military attachés from African countries' embassies in China and other countries' embassies in China were also invited to attend the banquet.

Before the banquet, General Chief of Staff Huang Yongsheng received the entire Malian military delegation and had a cordial and friendly conversation with them.

BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) – The Malian military delegation, at the invitation, is visiting China for a friendly visit. Led by Mamadou Diakit, Minister of Defense and Security of the Republic of Mali, the delegation arrived in Beijing by plane this morning.

    马里军事代表团应邀来我国进行友好访问
    我国防部设宴热烈欢迎马里贵宾
    黄永胜总参谋长说，最近，约翰逊政府在强化侵越战争的同时，又在现代修正主义的紧密配合下，加紧进行“和平谈判”的骗局，妄图从谈判桌上捞取它在战场上捞不到的东西。但是，这些都是徒劳的，都绝对挽救不了它侵越战争的彻底失败。
    马马杜·迪亚基特团长说，我们密切关注着毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命。中国无产阶级文化大革命，在全世界革命人民中引起了良好的反应，它每天都在取得更大的胜利。
    新华社一日讯　国防部今晚举行宴会，热烈欢迎由马里共和国负责国防和安全的部长级代表马马杜·迪亚基特率领的马里军事代表团。
    中国人民解放军总参谋长黄永胜和马马杜·迪亚基特先后在宴会上讲了话，共祝中马两国人民、两国军队之间的团结和友谊不断增长。
    黄永胜同志说，在我国无产阶级文化大革命节节胜利的凯歌声中，由马马杜·迪亚基特部长率领的马里共和国军事代表团，前来我国进行友好访问，我们感到十分高兴。他代表我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪副主席，代表国防部和中国人民解放军全体指战员，向马里贵宾表示热烈的欢迎。
    黄永胜同志赞扬马里人民具有反帝反殖斗争的光荣传统，对亚非人民团结反帝事业作出了积极的贡献，并衷心祝愿马里人民在凯塔总统领导下，在前进道路上不断取得新的胜利。
    黄永胜同志谈到亚非拉人民反帝武装斗争的大好形势，他说，我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“我们现在正处于世界革命的一个新的伟大的时代。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的革命风暴，定将给整个的旧世界以决定性的摧毁性的打击。”他说，英雄的越南人民，在伟大的抗美救国战争中已经把美帝国主义打得走投无路、狼狈不堪。最近，约翰逊政府在强化侵越战争的同时，又在现代修正主义的紧密配合下，加紧进行“和平谈判”的骗局，妄图从谈判桌上捞取它在战场上捞不到的东西。但是，这些都是徒劳的，都绝对挽救不了它侵越战争的彻底失败。世界上没有任何力量能够阻挡英雄的越南人民和广大亚非拉人民的胜利前进。
    黄永胜同志说，现在，在美国和欧洲，一个声势浩大的伟大革命风暴正在兴起。美国黑人抗暴斗争和法国工人、学生的革命斗争，就是这个伟大风暴来临的突出表现。这是资本主义世界内部冲突更加深刻剧烈的一个重大象征。它使以美国为首的帝国主义更加内外交困、危机四伏、处境异常困难。我们伟大领袖毛主席在支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明中指出：“可以肯定，殖民主义、帝国主义和一切剥削制度的彻底崩溃，世界上一切被压迫人民、被压迫民族的彻底翻身，已经为期不远了。”
    他说，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动、亲自领导的我国无产阶级文化大革命，正在向全面胜利迅猛前进。马里人民、非洲人民和全世界革命人民，对我国的无产阶级文化大革命给予了热情的支持和鼓舞。我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，也给予了全世界人民的革命斗争以极大的支持和鼓舞。
    他指出，我们一定更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。经过这场无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的中国人民，必将更有效地支援全世界人民的革命斗争，支援亚非拉人民的反帝革命斗争，更好地完成我们的国际主义义务。
    马马杜·迪亚基特接着在宴会上讲话。他代表以莫迪博·凯塔总统为首的马里人民，向在毛泽东主席领导下的伟大的中国人民表示友好的敬意。
    他说，我们密切关注着在你们伟大的国家中进行的革命史上空前未有的、即由毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命。
    马马杜·迪亚基特指出，无产阶级文化大革命在全世界革命人民中引起了良好的反应，它每天都在取得更大的胜利。我们对能够来中国亲眼看看这次文化大革命感到非常高兴。他感谢中国人民给予代表团的热情的、充满革命精神的欢迎。
    马马杜·迪亚基特祝林彪副主席直接指挥的中国人民解放军取得越来越大的成就。
    出席宴会的有中国人民解放军各总部、各军种、兵种、有关方面和北京市革命委员会的各负责人萧劲光、李天佑等，以及人民解放军陆、海、空三军代表，首都民兵和红卫兵小将的代表。
    马里驻中国大使馆临时代办姆萨·库里巴利，非洲国家驻中国使节和其他国家驻中国大使馆武官应邀出席了宴会。
    宴会前，黄永胜总参谋长接见了马里军事代表团的全体成员，并同他们进行了亲切友好的谈话。
