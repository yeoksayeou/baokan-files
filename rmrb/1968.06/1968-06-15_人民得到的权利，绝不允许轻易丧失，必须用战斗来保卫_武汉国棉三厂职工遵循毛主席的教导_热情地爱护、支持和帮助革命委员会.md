The workers of Wuhan Cotton Mill No. 3, following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, firmly defend, strongly support, and enthusiastically help the newly established revolutionary committee, making this factory's revolutionary committee more consolidated and perfected in the stormy waves of class struggle, becoming a revolutionary fighting command center that leads all the revolutionary workers of the factory to launch fierce attacks on the class enemy.

After the revolutionary committee of Wuhan Cotton Mill No. 3 was established at the beginning of this year, a handful of class enemies hid behind the scenes, spreading malicious rumors and attempting to sabotage the newly established revolutionary committee. The revolutionary workers of this factory, tempered and tested by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, firmly remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle." They resolutely defend the newly established revolutionary committee. They say, the establishment of the revolutionary committee is the fruit of hard struggle by all the revolutionary workers of the factory under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. It is a tool for the proletariat to exercise dictatorship over the class enemy. Defending the revolutionary committee is defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. All the revolutionary workers of the factory maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance. They use the perspective of class struggle and the method of class analysis to observe and analyze the enemy situation, continuously exposing the evil activities of the class enemy, and rooting out the counter-revolutionary elements who conspired to sabotage the revolutionary committee, defending the newly established revolutionary committee.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The most fundamental thing in the reform of state organs is to connect with the masses." The revolutionary workers of Wuhan Cotton Mill No. 3 always care about the ideological revolutionization of the members of this factory's revolutionary committee. When they find shortcomings in the work of the revolutionary committee members, they always sincerely help the comrades of the revolutionary committee to overcome their shortcomings from a place of concern and care, maintaining close ties with the masses and advancing on the road of revolutionization. Once, the weather suddenly turned cold, and some members of the factory's revolutionary committee who were in a meeting wore cotton coats from the factory. The revolutionary workers saw this and sincerely pointed out to them: "The comrades of the revolutionary committee should lead the way for everyone. Wearing a cotton coat is a small matter, but separating from the masses is a big deal. The members of the revolutionary committee cannot be special, and once there is special treatment, they will separate from the masses." The members of the factory's revolutionary committee were deeply moved by these opinions from the revolutionary workers and specially held a meeting to discuss this issue. Everyone said: "We cannot overlook the matter of wearing a public cotton coat; this is a big issue related to the direction in which the leading cadre goes." After serious discussion and research, the factory's revolutionary committee made a decision on ideological revolutionization, work style revolutionization, and life revolutionization. From then on, the members of the factory's revolutionary committee often went deep into the workshops, working, studying, and criticizing and repudiating revisionism together with the worker masses, and implementing Chairman Mao's latest directives. The workers happily said: "The members of our factory's revolutionary committee are truly our close friends!"

When the members of the revolutionary committee of this factory encounter difficulties in their work, the revolutionary workers enthusiastically help and encourage them to overcome difficulties and advance to victory. Workers Huang Youcang and Huang Chengying were both elected into the factory and workshop revolutionary committees, feeling that the burden was heavy and lacking confidence. After the revolutionary workers learned about their active thoughts, they all enthusiastically helped and encouraged them. Old worker Hu Cuijing often had heart-to-heart talks with them, using Chairman Mao's teachings to encourage them to move forward, and also did her best to help them do their work well. This deeply moved Huang Youcang and Huang Chengying. They said: With the great leader Chairman Mao supporting us, and such good worker comrades encouraging us, we not only want to do it but also want to do it well and do it to the end. Now, these two comrades are working more enthusiastically and with more achievements.

The revolutionary workers of Wuhan Cotton Mill No. 3 also strive to do a good job in revolution and production, doing their best at their own posts, and firmly supporting the revolutionary committee with practical actions. Old worker Liu Changshou of the spinning workshop strives to complete all the tasks assigned by the revolutionary committee with all his might, fully supporting the revolutionary committee.

Now, under the firm defense, strong support, and enthusiastic help of all the revolutionary workers, the revolutionary committee of Wuhan Cotton Mill No. 3 is continuously consolidated and perfected, leading all the revolutionary workers of the factory to launch fierce attacks on a handful of class enemies, making the revolution of this factory hot and vibrant, and production continuously improving.

    人民得到的权利，绝不允许轻易丧失，必须用战斗来保卫
    武汉国棉三厂职工遵循毛主席的教导
    热情地爱护、支持和帮助革命委员会
    据新华社武汉十四日电　武汉国棉三厂的广大革命职工，遵循伟大领袖毛主席“人民得到的权利，绝不允许轻易丧失，必须用战斗来保卫”的教导，对新生的革命委员会坚决捍卫、大力支持、热情帮助，使这个厂的革命委员会在阶级斗争的大风大浪中不断巩固和完善，成为率领全厂广大革命职工向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻的革命战斗指挥部。
    武汉国棉三厂革委会在今年初成立以后，一小撮阶级敌人就躲在幕后煽阴风，点鬼火，妄图搞垮新生的革命委员会。这个厂经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼和考验的革命职工，牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，坚决捍卫新生的革命委员会。他们说，革委会的成立，是在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，全厂革命职工艰苦奋斗的胜利果实，它是无产阶级对阶级敌人实行专政的工具。我们保卫革命委员会，就是保卫毛主席的革命路线。全厂革命职工时刻保持着高度的革命警惕性。他们用阶级斗争的观点和阶级分析的方法，观察和分析敌情，不断揭露阶级敌人的罪恶活动，挖出了阴谋搞垮革委会的反革命分子，保卫了新生的革命委员会。
    毛主席教导我们：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”武汉国棉三厂的革命职工，时时刻刻关心着这个厂革委会成员的思想革命化。他们发现革委会成员工作中有缺点时，总是满腔热情地从关心和爱护出发，诚恳地帮助革委会的同志们克服缺点，和群众保持密切联系，在革命化的道路上不断前进。有一次，天气突然变冷，正在开会的厂革委会有的成员便穿了厂里的棉大衣。革命职工看到以后，诚恳地向他们提出：“革委会的同志要给大家带好路。穿一件棉大衣事小，脱离群众事大。革委会成员不能特殊化，一有特殊化，就会脱离群众。”厂革委会成员听了革命职工这些意见，很受感动，专门就这件事开了一次会议，进行讨论。大家说：“不能小看穿了件公家的棉大衣这件事，这是关系到领导班子向哪个方向走的大问题。”经过认真的讨论和研究，厂革委会作出了思想革命化、作风革命化和生活革命化的决定。从此，厂革委会成员经常深入到车间，同工人群众一起劳动，一起学习，一起斗私批修，一起落实毛主席的最新指示。工人们高兴地说：“我们厂的革委会成员，真是我们的贴心人啊！”
    这个厂的革命委员会成员在工作中遇到困难时，革命职工就满腔热情地帮助和鼓励他们克服困难，胜利前进。工人黄友堂和黄诚英被分别选进了厂和车间的革委会，感到重担难挑，信心不足。革命职工了解到他们这些活思想以后，都热情地帮助和鼓励他们。老工人胡翠经常找他们谈心，用毛主席的教导鼓励他们前进，同时还尽力帮助他们做好工作。这使黄友堂和黄诚英深受感动。他们表示：有伟大领袖毛主席给我们撑腰，有这样好的工人同志鼓励我们，我们不但要干，而且要干好，要干到底。现在，这两位同志工作越干越起劲，越干越有成绩。
    武汉国棉三厂的广大革命职工，还努力搞好革命和生产，做好自己岗位的工作，用实际行动来坚决支持革命委员会。摇纱车间老工人柳长寿，对革委会布置的工作都尽一切力量努力完成，全力支持革命委员会。
    现在，武汉国棉三厂的革委会在广大革命职工的坚决捍卫、大力支持和热情帮助下，不断得到巩固和完善，正在率领全厂广大革命职工向一小撮阶级敌人猛攻，使这个厂的革命搞得热气腾腾，生产日新月异。
