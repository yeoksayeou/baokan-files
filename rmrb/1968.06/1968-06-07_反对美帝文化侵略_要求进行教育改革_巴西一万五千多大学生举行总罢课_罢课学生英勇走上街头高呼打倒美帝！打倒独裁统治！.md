More than 15,000 university students in Brazil hold a general strike

Striking students bravely take to the streets, shouting, "Down with U.S. imperialism! Down with the dictatorship!"

Xinhua News Agency, June 6th: A message from Rio de Janeiro: More than 15,000 university students in major cities such as Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo in Brazil announced a general strike on the 5th, opposing the federal government's policy of slave-like education and demanding an increase in educational funds, improvement of teachers' living conditions, and a thorough educational reform.

This general strike is another development in the struggle of Brazilian university students against U.S. imperialist cultural infiltration and the dictatorship supported by the United States.

Earlier, students in the city of Tucuruí in the state of Pará held a demonstration and march on the 4th and clashed with reactionary police. Students from six departments of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro also went on strike on the 4th. In the state capital of Goiás, Goiânia, and the state capital of Espírito Santo, Vitória, university students began striking last week. Students in Vitória also occupied a university building on the 5th. In the state capital of Pernambuco in northeastern Brazil, Recife, hundreds of university students recently held a public meeting in the city center to protest the unreasonable arrest of innocent students by the police and demanded their immediate release.

Brazilian students have repeatedly launched large-scale struggles against U.S. imperialist cultural invasion and the reactionary educational policies of the pro-American dictatorship since last December and this April. In those two struggles, students across the country held continuous strikes and bravely took to the streets, shouting slogans such as "Down with U.S. imperialism," "Down with the dictatorship," and "Down with the U.S.-Brazil agreement," opposing the cultural "aid" agreement signed by the pro-American dictatorship in Brazil with the U.S. Agency for International Development.

The people and students of Brazil have continuously held large-scale demonstrations and meetings, strongly protesting the atrocities committed by U.S. imperialism and its running dogs against the Brazilian people, and shouting slogans such as "Down with U.S. imperialism!" and "Down with the dictatorship!"
