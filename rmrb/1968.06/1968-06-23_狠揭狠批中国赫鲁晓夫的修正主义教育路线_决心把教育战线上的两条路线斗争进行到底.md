Beijing's Di'anmen Middle School students, teachers, and parents unite to carry out a revolutionary criticism and denunciation campaign. They resolutely expose and denounce the revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev, determined to carry the struggle between the two lines on the educational front to the end.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 22nd, Beijing's Di'anmen Middle School, in the course of criticizing the revisionist educational line, formed a "three-in-one" denunciation team composed of revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary parents. They exposed and denounced the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev in promoting the revisionist educational line in all grades of the school. This has powerfully promoted the in-depth development of the school's revolutionary criticism and denunciation campaign, and the educational revolution has taken on a vibrant scene.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To carry out the proletarian educational revolution, we must rely on the broad revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers in the schools, and rely on the active elements among them, that is, the proletarian revolutionaries who are determined to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end." The revolutionary committee and military training team of Di'anmen Middle School have always remembered Chairman Mao's teachings and consciously implemented them. They often analyze the new situations in the movement, discover typical cases, and lead the entire body. The school revolutionary committee and military training team, in the course of deeply investigating and researching among the masses, discovered some revolutionary students and parents who had been persecuted by the revisionist educational line, as well as revolutionary teachers who had executed the revisionist educational line but were brave enough to stand up and criticize it. They helped them form a "three-in-one" denunciation team to expose and denounce the crimes of the revisionist educational line.

The "three-in-one" denunciation team, based on their personal experiences, deeply exposed the reactionary essence of the revisionist educational line. Hu Zhonghe, a revolutionary student in the denunciation team, comes from a worker's family. He loves Chairman Mao, loves Mao Zedong Thought, is enthusiastic about collective work, actively participates in labor, and studies hard. However, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents promoted "intellectual education first," "grades as the criterion," and other revisionist black goods, excluding and attacking him. They usually oppressed him with heavy homework and attacked him with tricky questions during exams. In the annual final exam, Hu Zhonghe was just half a point short in one subject and was not allowed to pass; in another subject, because he did not hand in his homework a few times, even if he passed the exam, it did not count as passing. In this way, he was deprived of the right to advance to the next grade. The teachers and cadres in the denunciation team exposed that Di'anmen Middle School originally had twelve classes in one grade, but due to repeating a grade and dropping out, it shrank to ten classes by graduation. Most of those eliminated were children of workers and peasants. The denunciation team exposed a large number of facts, making people clearly see that the purpose of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in promoting the revisionist educational line was to cultivate successors of the bourgeoisie and serve their conspiracy to restore capitalism.

Hu Zhonghe's parents said, in the old society, I started as an apprentice at the age of thirteen and suffered endless exploitation and oppression from the capitalists; I couldn't study. After liberation, we workers stood up, and our children all went to school. It was truly a joy! But the Chinese Khrushchev promoted the revisionist educational line, excluding and attacking the children of workers and peasants, and practicing bourgeois dictatorship over the working people, attempting to restore capitalism. We, the working class, will not allow it. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and thoroughly criticize and denounce the revisionist educational line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev.

The "three-in-one" denunciation team of Di'anmen Middle School exposed and denounced the revisionist educational line, helping the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and parents further enhance their class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness. Some who originally thought that the revisionist educational line had already been criticized and thus had a slackening attitude towards the revolutionary criticism and denunciation campaign, decided to combine it with various tasks and continue to carry out the revolutionary criticism and denunciation campaign in depth, carrying the proletarian educational revolution to the end. Teachers also expressed their determination to better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, use Mao Zedong Thought to criticize and denounce revisionism, and carry the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines on the educational front to the end.

The formation of the "three-in-one" denunciation team has made the school's connection with society broader and closer. Revolutionary teachers, revolutionary students, and revolutionary parents all care about the revolutionary criticism and denunciation campaign and the proletarian educational revolution. Some classes in the school have established educational revolution committees composed of revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, revolutionary parents, and street cadres. Everyone studies Chairman Mao's works together, criticizes the revisionist educational line together, and jointly studies the issue of cultivating and fostering successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

The "three-in-one" denunciation team of Di'anmen Middle School also accepted invitations from other schools in the city to go out for activities. According to statistics, more than 60,000 people have listened to their denunciation of the revisionist educational line, and their activities have been warmly supported.

    北京地安门中学学生教师家长同心协力开展革命大批判
    狠揭狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义教育路线
    决心把教育战线上的两条路线斗争进行到底
    据新华社二十二日讯　北京市地安门中学在批判修正主义教育路线中，组成了一个由革命学生、革命教师和革命家长参加的“三结合”控诉团，在全校各个年级揭发、控诉中国赫鲁晓夫推行修正主义教育路线的滔天罪行，有力地推动了全校革命大批判的深入开展，教育革命出现了生气勃勃的景象。
    毛主席教导我们：“进行无产阶级教育革命，要依靠学校中广大革命的学生，革命的教员，革命的工人，要依靠他们中间的积极分子，即决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。”地安门中学革命委员会和军训团的同志牢记毛主席的教导，自觉地贯彻执行。他们经常分析运动发展的新情况，发现典型，带动全体。校革委会和军训团的同志在深入群众调查研究中，发现了一些受修正主义教育路线迫害的革命学生和家长，以及执行过修正主义教育路线但能勇于起来进行批判的革命教师，帮助他们组织起一个“三结合”的控诉团，揭发、控诉修正主义教育路线的罪行。
      “三结合”控诉团根据亲身经历，深刻地揭露了修正主义教育路线的反动本质。“三结合”控诉团成员中的革命学生胡忠鹤，出身于工人家庭，热爱毛主席，热爱毛泽东思想，热心为集体工作，积极参加劳动，努力学习。可是，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行
  “智育第一”、“分数挂帅”等修正主义黑货，对他进行排斥和打击。平时用沉重的作业压，考试时出偏题袭击。在一年期终考试中，胡忠鹤有一门功课差一点五分，不让他及格；另一门功课因为几次没交作业，考及格了也不算及格。就这样，他被剥夺了升级的权利。控诉团中的教师和干部揭露，地安门中学有一个年级原有十二个班，由于留级、退学，到毕业时缩成了十个班，被淘汰的大部分是工农子女。控诉团揭发的大量事实，使人们清楚地看到，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行修正主义教育路线的目的，就是要培养资产阶级的接班人，为其复辟资本主义的阴谋服务。
    胡忠鹤的家长说，在旧社会里，我十三岁当学徒，受尽资本家的剥削和压迫，念不了书；解放后，我们工人翻了身，子女都上了学，真高兴啊！可是中国赫鲁晓夫推行修正主义教育路线，排斥打击工农子女，对劳动人民实行资产阶级专政，妄想复辟资本主义。我们工人阶级决不答应。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，把中国赫鲁晓夫推行的修正主义教育路线批深批透。
    地安门中学“三结合”控诉团对修正主义教育路线的揭发、控诉，帮助广大革命师生、革命家长进一步提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟。一些原来觉得修正主义教育路线已经批判过了，因而对革命大批判产生了松劲情绪的人，决心结合各项工作，把革命大批判持续不断地深入开展下去，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底。教师们也表示决心，一定要更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想斗私批修，把教育战线上的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争进行到底。
      “三结合”控诉团的组成，使学校和社会的联系更加广泛和密切，革命教师、革命学生、革命家长都来关心革命大批判和无产阶级教育革命。学校里有的班级建立了由革命学生、革命教师、革命家长和街道干部组成的教育革命委员会，大家在一起学习毛主席著作，一起批判修正主义教育路线，共同研究培养和造就无产阶级革命事业接班人的问题。
    地安门中学“三结合”控诉团还应本市其他一些学校的邀请，到校外活动。据统计，听过他们对修正主义教育路线控诉的已达六万多人次，他们的活动受到热烈支持。
