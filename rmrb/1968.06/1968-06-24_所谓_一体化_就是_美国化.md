With the flourishing development of the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world and the deepening of the political and economic crises in the United States, the U.S. imperialists' control and plunder of Latin America, as well as their suppression of the Latin American peoples, are becoming increasingly tight. In addition to closely collaborating with the reactionaries of various Latin American countries to plot the suppression of the people's armed revolutionary struggles, the U.S. imperialists are also vigorously promoting the so-called "economic integration of Latin America" plan, attempting to firmly grasp Latin America within their claws.

The U.S. imperialists have always adopted cunning tactics in their aggression against Latin America, maintaining the formal independence of Latin American countries while keeping them in a dependent position in economic, financial, and military aspects. The past advocacy of "Pan-American cooperation," "Alliance for Progress," and the current promotion of "economic integration of Latin America" are nothing but tricks used by U.S. imperialists to invade and enslave the Latin American peoples.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has said: "In the world, there are only friendships between cats, not between cats and mice." The U.S. imperialists are the greatest exploiters of Latin America and the most ferocious enemies of the Latin American peoples. They bring out this "integration" trick, merely to manipulate the economic lifelines of various Latin American countries, including industry, transportation, trade, finance, and so on, according to the requirements and plans of U.S. monopolistic capital, so as to facilitate their more stringent control and more rampant plunder. It is to facilitate the large-scale influx of U.S. imperialist capital and goods into Latin America, making the various Latin American countries further descend into its colony. "Mine is mine, and yours is also mine." The so-called "economic integration of Latin America" by the U.S. imperialists is actually "Americanization," which is further implementing "colonialization" in Latin America.

Furthermore, under the guise of "integration," the U.S. imperialists first aim to connect the road systems, river systems, and power, transportation, and telecommunications of various Latin American countries that have military value within five years. This fully exposes that the U.S. imperialists' promotion of "integration" not only focuses on economic aggression but also has military strategic purposes. It is a component of the U.S. imperialists' grand conspiracy to suppress the revolutionary struggles of the Latin American peoples and to conduct military aggression against Latin America.

However, in today's Latin America where the peoples are increasingly awakening, the U.S. imperialists' intensified aggression against Latin America can only provoke the Latin American peoples to launch more fierce resistance. Is the recent surge in revolutionary struggles of the masses in various Latin American countries not the best proof of this?

### 所谓“一体化”就是“美国化”

    所谓“一体化”就是“美国化”
    随着世界人民革命斗争的蓬勃发展和美国政治经济危机的日益加深，美帝国主义对拉丁美洲的控制和掠夺，对拉丁美洲人民的镇压，也步步加紧。美帝国主义除了同拉丁美洲各国的反动派加紧策划镇压人民的革命武装斗争以外，还竭力推行所谓“拉丁美洲经济一体化”计划，妄图把拉丁美洲牢牢地掌握在它的魔爪之中。
    美帝国主义侵略拉丁美洲一贯采取狡猾的手段，使拉丁美洲国家保持形式上的独立，而在经济、财政和军事方面处于依赖的地位。过去标榜的什么“泛美合作”、“争取进步联盟”以及目前推行的“拉丁美洲经济一体化”，都不过是美帝国主义侵略和奴役拉丁美洲人民的鬼花招罢了。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席曾经说过：“世界上只有猫和猫做朋友的事，没有猫和老鼠做朋友的事。”美帝国主义是拉丁美洲的最大的剥削者，是拉丁美洲人民的最凶恶的敌人。它搬出“一体化”这个玩艺儿，无非是要把拉丁美洲各国的经济命脉，包括工业、运输、贸易、金融等等，通通按照美国垄断资本的要求和计划进行摆布，以便于他们实行更严密的控制和更猖狂的掠夺，以便于美帝国主义的资本和商品大量流入拉丁美洲，使拉丁美洲各国进一步沦为它的殖民地。“我的是我的，你的也是我的。”美帝国主义的所谓“拉丁美洲经济一体化”实际上就是“美国化”，就是在拉丁美洲进一步实行“殖民地化”。
    不仅如此，美帝国主义假“一体化”之名，首先要在五年之内，把拉丁美洲各国的具有军事价值的公路、河流系统，以及动力、交通、电讯连接起来。这彻底暴露了美帝国主义推行“一体化”，不仅着眼于经济侵略，而且有着军事战略上的目的。它是美帝国主义镇压拉丁美洲人民革命斗争、对拉丁美洲进行军事侵略的大阴谋的一个组成部分。
    但是，在拉丁美洲人民日益觉醒的今天，美帝国主义对拉丁美洲加紧侵略，只能促使拉丁美洲人民起来进行更加猛烈的反抗。最近拉丁美洲各国革命群众斗争的新高涨，不就是绝好的证明吗？
