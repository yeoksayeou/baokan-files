Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," and amidst the triumphant songs of the ongoing victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, China's summer harvest crops have once again achieved a bumper harvest. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have actively learned and applied Mao Zedong Thought, engaging in a relentless struggle to secure this summer's bumper harvest. Many members of revolutionary committees and the broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army have fought side by side with the poor and lower-middle peasants, using revolution to drive the summer harvest and promote production.

New China News Agency, June 20th: Under the great situation of the ongoing victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and guided by Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," the billion poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in China's rural areas have, after several months of arduous struggle, achieved a bumper harvest of summer grains and oil crops. In the past half month, from the mountains of Sichuan to the shores of the Bohai Sea, from the eight hundred miles of the Qin River to the coast of the East China Sea, reports of bumper harvests have been pouring in. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres are enthusiastically celebrating the bumper harvest of summer crops this year as a great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!

This year's summer harvest situation is excellent. In the south, summer grains and oil crops have, on the basis of consecutive years of bumper harvests, once again achieved a satisfactory bumper harvest. Sichuan Province, known as the "Land of Abundance," has seen a universal increase in wheat, barley, peas, broad beans, and rapeseed compared to last year. Along the East China Sea, Zhejiang Province has seen bumper harvests of wheat, barley, and broad beans, and has emerged with a number of high-yielding models over large areas. Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Shanghai, as well as other provinces and municipalities, have also seen bumper harvests. In the north, the main wheat-producing provinces of Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Shanxi, and Shaanxi, despite encountering spring cold or spring drought in many places, have generally seen good harvests. Some regions have achieved increased production plans even in the face of severe natural disasters, and have emerged with a number of significantly increased production brigades and teams.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has promoted the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking, becoming a powerful driving force for the development of socialist production. Under the continuous victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in rural areas, with boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, have persistently learned and applied Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," and have engaged in a relentless struggle to achieve victory in both revolution and production.

Following the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching that "holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes," various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been held in rural areas across the country. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to firmly grasp the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, launching a deep and sustained exposure and criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pushed by China's Khrushchev and his agents, as well as the sabotage activities of a handful of capitalist roaders within the party and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. Through the revolutionary criticism and struggle, the class enemies have been severely struck down, and the class consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have been greatly heightened. People's socialist enthusiasm has soared to unprecedented heights, and they have enthusiastically thrown themselves into the revolutionary and production struggles. Therefore, the various tasks from sowing to field management of summer grains and oil crops this year have generally been carried out well, laying a very favorable foundation for achieving a bumper harvest.

This year's summer crop production in the north and south has been carried out under the great situation of the surging forward of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the establishment of revolutionary committees at all levels. The leading bodies at all levels have become increasingly complete, and revolutionary cadres at all levels have enthusiastically joined the ranks of the struggle to "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness." Together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, they have unswervingly acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions and wholeheartedly walked the socialist road. Various places have also, according to Chairman Mao's great teaching of "learning agriculture from Dazhai," further launched a wave of learning from and catching up with Dazhai. The billion poor and lower-middle peasants have taken Dazhai as an example, carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle, and while fighting against class enemies, have bravely and tenaciously fought against nature, launching large-scale agricultural basic construction. Last winter and this spring, whether in mountainous areas or plains, a large number of small water conservancy projects such as ponds, reservoirs, and wells have been newly built and repaired, canals have been dug, and land has been leveled. For some projects, matching has been carried out to ensure water supply for spring production, creating relatively good conditions for the summer bumper harvest in agriculture.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "Every year, the three tasks of harvesting, storing, and eating (harvesting, storing, and eating) must be grasped very tightly." Following Chairman Mao's teaching, revolutionary committees at all levels or revolutionary preparatory small groups, and the people's liberation army in various places, before the summer harvest rush, have mobilized and organized various forces to welcome the bumper harvest. Many leaders of revolutionary committees and responsible comrades of the people's liberation army have taken the lead in going to the front lines of the summer harvest, fighting side by side with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, leading everyone to learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought in the summer harvest, using revolution to drive the summer harvest and promote production. To fight this summer harvest battle, the work of supporting the summer harvest by various sectors has also been grasped tightly, and the repair and supply of agricultural machinery and summer harvest supplies have been carried out relatively promptly. The broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army support agriculture troops and Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams who have been fighting on the front lines of agricultural production from spring to summer, in addition to participating in summer harvest labor, have also actively helped community members hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, persistently studying Chairman Mao's works and continuing to carry out revolutionary criticism and struggle in the busy season, continuously pushing revolution and production forward.

    在无产阶级文化大革命节节胜利的凯歌声中
    我国今年夏收作物又获丰收
    广大贫下中农和革命干部，活学活用毛泽东思想，为夺取今年夏季丰收进行了英勇不屈的斗争许多革委会领导成员和解放军广大指战员，同广大贫下中农并肩战斗，用革命带动夏收促进夏收
    新华社二十日讯　我国农村亿万贫下中农和革命干部，在无产阶级文化大革命节节胜利的大好形势下，在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针指引下，经过几个月的艰苦奋斗，夺得了全国夏收粮食、油料作物的丰收。近半个多月来，从巴山蜀水到渤海之滨，从八百里秦川到东海沿岸，丰收捷报频传，广大贫下中农和革命干部热烈欢呼，今年夏收作物丰收是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利！
    今年全国夏收形势喜人。在南方，夏收粮食、油料作物在连年丰收的基础上，又一次获得了可喜的丰收。被称为“天府之国”的四川省，今年小麦、大麦、豌豆、蚕豆和油菜籽，普遍比去年增产。东海之滨的浙江省，小麦、大麦和蚕豆，样样丰收，并且涌现了一批大面积高产的典型。江苏、安徽、江西、湖南、湖北、上海等省、市，也都是丰收年景。在北方，我国主要产麦区河南、山东、河北、山西、陕西等省，尽管有不少地方今年遇到了春寒或春旱等自然灾害，但总的来看收成仍然较好。其中有些地区，在自然灾害较重的情况下实现了增产计划，并且涌现了一批显著增产的社队。
    无产阶级文化大革命，促进了人们思想的革命化，成为推动社会主义生产发展的巨大动力。在无产阶级文化大革命不断取得胜利的鼓舞下，农村广大贫下中农和革命干部，怀着无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的深厚的无产阶级感情，坚持不懈地活学活用毛泽东思想，坚决贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，为夺取革命和生产双胜利进行了英勇不屈的斗争。
    根据伟大领袖毛主席的“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的教导，各地农村先后举办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，广大贫下中农和革命干部以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所推行的反革命修正主义路线，对党内一小撮走资派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子的破坏活动，展开深入、持久的揭露和批判。通过革命大批判，狠狠地打击了阶级敌人，大大地提高了广大贫下中农和革命干部阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，人们的社会主义积极性空前高涨，意气风发地投入革命和生产斗争。因此，今年夏收粮食和油料作物从播种到田间管理的各项工作，一般都进行得较好，为夺取丰收打下了十分有利的基础。
    今年南北各地夏收作物的生产，是在无产阶级文化大革命的洪流滚滚向前，各级革命委员会联翩建立的空前大好形势下进行的。各级革命领导班子越来越健全，各级革命干部踊跃地投身到“抓革命、促生产、促工作、促战备”的战斗行列中来。他们同广大贫下中农一道，坚定不移地按照毛主席的指示办事，一心一意地走社会主义道路。各地还根据毛主席“农业学大寨”的伟大教导，进一步掀起了学大寨、赶大寨的热潮。亿万贫下中农以大寨为榜样，发扬自力更生，艰苦奋斗的革命精神，在同阶级敌人作斗争的同时，勇敢顽强地斗天斗地，大搞农田基本建设。去冬今春，不论山区或平原都新修和整修大批塘坝、水库、水井等小型水利工程，挖渠、平整土地，为一些工程配套，保证了今年春季生产的用水，为农业夏季丰收创造了较好的条件。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“每年一定要把收割、保管、吃用三件事（收、管、吃）抓得很紧很紧。”遵照毛主席这一教导，各级革命委员会或革筹小组、各地人民解放军，在夏收大忙到来之前，就动员组织各种力量，迎接丰收。许多革命委员会的领导成员和人民解放军的负责同志，带头深入到夏收第一线，同广大贫下中农并肩战斗，领导大家在夏收中活学活用毛泽东思想，用革命带动夏收，促进夏收。为打好夏收这一仗，各行各业支援夏收的工作也抓得较紧，农机具和夏收用品的修配和供应都作得比较及时。从春到夏一直战斗在农业生产第一线的中国人民解放军支农部队和毛泽东思想宣传队的广大指战员，除参加夏收劳动外，还积极帮助社员举办毛泽东思想学习班，在大忙季节坚持学习毛主席著作，持续开展革命大批判，把革命和生产不断地向前推进。
