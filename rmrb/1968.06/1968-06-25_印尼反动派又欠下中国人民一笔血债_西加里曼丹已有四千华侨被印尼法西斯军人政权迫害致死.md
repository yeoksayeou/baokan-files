The Indonesian reactionaries have once again incurred a debt of blood to the Chinese people. In West Kalimantan, 4,000 overseas Chinese have been persecuted to death by the Indonesian fascist military regime.

	YAKARTA, June 25 (Xinhua) — In the large-scale massacre and persecution of overseas Chinese carried out by the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime in West Kalimantan last October, tens of thousands of refugees who were forced to flee their homes had, by early May this year, 4,000 people persecuted to death by the Indonesian reactionary regime. This is yet another debt of blood that the Indonesian reactionaries owe to the Chinese people.

	According to reports, among the refugees who were persecuted to death, there were more than 2,000 in Pontianak and more than 800 in Singkawang. Many of them were pregnant women and children. They died either from starvation or from illnesses that went untreated; many were taken to concentration camps where they were tortured to death.

	Over the past half-year, the Indonesian fascist military regime has made no arrangements whatsoever for the tens of thousands of homeless refugees in West Kalimantan, and has instead continued to persecute them. According to reports, the tens of thousands of refugees who were forced to flee to Pontianak, Singkawang, Sefak, and Senggang, rely mainly on odd jobs for survival. Many have no clothes or food, and are suffering from both poverty and illness. The Indonesian reactionary regime has also set up various obstacles to prevent the sick refugees from receiving treatment.

	According to another report, recently, the Indonesian reactionary army, while "mopping up" the people's armed forces in Menggala and Huawei, arbitrarily arrested hundreds of innocent young and middle-aged refugees, throwing them into concentration camps where they were severely tortured. Many were seriously injured, and some were beaten to death.

	The debt of blood that the Indonesian reactionaries owe to the Chinese people must be repaid. The fascist military regime, which is now surrounded by the broad revolutionary people of Indonesia, will, no matter how it struggles, inevitably meet its doom.

    印尼反动派又欠下中国人民一笔血债
    西加里曼丹已有四千华侨被印尼法西斯军人政权迫害致死
    新华社讯　雅加达消息：在印度尼西亚苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权去年十月在西加里曼丹制造的大规模屠杀和迫害华侨的法西斯暴行中，被迫流离失所的数万名难侨，到今年五月初就有四千人被印尼反动政权迫害致死。这是印尼反动派欠下中国人民的又一笔血债。
    据报道，这些被迫害致死的难侨，在坤甸有两千多人，山口洋有八百多人，其中许多是孕妇和儿童。他们由于没有吃的或因患病得不到治疗而致死亡；有许多人则被抓进集中营遭受酷刑，活活被折磨死的。
    半年多来，印尼法西斯军人政权对西加里曼丹数万名无家可归的难侨，根本不作任何安置，而且不断对他们进行迫害。据报道，被迫流离到坤甸、山口洋、三发和松柏港等地的数万名难侨，绝大部分靠打零工度日，不少人无衣无食，贫病交迫，处境非常悲惨。印尼反动政权还设置种种障碍，使患病的难侨得不到治疗。
    另据报道，最近，印尼反动军队在孟加影、华莪等地“围剿”西加里曼丹人民武装力量时，无理拘捕无辜的青壮年难侨几百名，把他们投入集中营，进行严刑拷打，不少人受重伤，有的被活活打死。
    印尼反动派欠下中国人民的血债是一定要偿还的。正在陷入印尼广大革命人民包围之中的法西斯军人政权，不管怎样进行挣扎，绝对逃脱不了最后覆灭的命运。
