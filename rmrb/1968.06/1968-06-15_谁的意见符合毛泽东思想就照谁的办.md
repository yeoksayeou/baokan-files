Our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin said: "Our country is a great proletarian dictatorship socialist country with a population of 700 million. It needs a unified thought, a revolutionary thought, a correct thought, and that is Mao Zedong Thought. With this thought, we can maintain a vigorous revolutionary spirit and have a firm and correct political direction." The new and old cadres of the Wuhan Post and Telecommunications Institute Revolutionary Committee firmly remember this directive. From formulating the entire institute's work plan to handling daily affairs, they all take Mao Zedong Thought as the fundamental guiding principle. Whoever's opinion aligns with Mao Zedong Thought, follow that person's advice.

In the early days of resuming classes and making revolution, various classes proposed plans to conduct investigations on educational revolution in society. Some even wanted to go to Shanghai and Guangzhou. The Revolutionary Committee member responsible for the specific work of the educational revolution is a representative of the revolutionary masses. This young cadre fully supported the plan to conduct investigations in society and actively helped students contact some factories and construction units. He happily reported the masses' demands to the responsible person of the educational revolution leadership group, the revolutionary cadre Guo Jijiang, thinking he would get his approval. Unexpectedly, Guo Jijiang disagreed immediately. He said: "If each class goes out one by one, this does not align with Chairman Mao's directive on resuming classes and making revolution. If all the students go out, who will handle the school's struggle, criticism, and transformation?" This new cadre was unhappy and said: "This is the opinion of the masses. If you disagree, you are alienating yourself from the masses." Guo Jijiang said: "The masses' opinions have correct ones and ones that are not well-considered. Revolutionary masses listen most to Chairman Mao's words. We insist on acting according to Mao Zedong Thought and will not alienate ourselves from the masses." Guo Jijiang insisted that conducting social investigations could only be organized in a planned manner with a small number of people.

This new cadre felt that the leadership's opinion was too far from the masses' demands, thinking the matter was difficult to handle. When more students came to discuss conducting social investigations, he simply told them to go directly to Guo Jijiang. Guo Jijiang, this old comrade who is weak and often ill, felt much younger after working with the young cadres in the Revolutionary Committee. He patiently received batch after batch of students, explaining to them again and again. Sometimes he even went to the classes to talk with the students or engage in debates, actively doing persuasion work.

This new cadre saw Guo Jijiang's methods and thought: "Old Guo, such a revolutionary old cadre, handles problems by thinking long-term and from a comprehensive perspective. For the masses' opinions, he accepts those that align with Mao Zedong Thought and persuades those that do not. On the surface, Old Guo seems to have rejected the opinions from the masses, but because he insists on acting according to Mao Zedong Thought and explains to the masses using Chairman Mao's teachings, he actually did not alienate himself from the masses but instead gained greater trust from the masses." Thus, this new cadre also actively brought Guo Jijiang's opinions to the masses and discussed with everyone. Many students told him: "Old Guo's opinion is correct, and we should act according to his opinion." They also actively suggested forming a small but high-quality social investigation team composed of revolutionary teachers and students to conduct investigations in nearby rural people's communes and factories.

This new cadre reported these reflections from the masses to Guo Jijiang. Guo Jijiang happily said: "'The masses are the real heroes, and we ourselves are often childish and ridiculous,' this is a true truth. The masses think more comprehensively and thoroughly. Indeed, the masses listen most to Chairman Mao's words and act most according to Mao Zedong Thought!" This new cadre was even more excited and said: "Now I understand a truth: To not alienate oneself from the masses, the most fundamental thing is to never alienate oneself from Mao Zedong Thought for a moment."

The educational revolution leadership group combined Guo Jijiang's opinions with the masses' suggestions and made a decision to arrange everything comprehensively, strongly promoting the school's struggle, criticism, and transformation.

From then on, this new cadre became more careful in his work, always measuring things with Mao Zedong Thought and considering them comprehensively. His relationship with Guo Jijiang also became closer, exchanging opinions fully on matters and cooperating well with each other.

The new and old cadres of the Shanghai Railway Bureau Songjiang Line Revolutionary Committee learn from each other, help each other, and improve together, determined to act as Chairman Mao taught, ensuring that the older generation does not alienate themselves from the masses and that the young generation gets tempered.

### 谁的意见符合毛泽东思想就照谁的办

    谁的意见符合毛泽东思想就照谁的办
    我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林副主席说：“我国是一个伟大的无产阶级专政的社会主义国家，有七亿人口，需要有一个统一的思想，革命的思想，正确的思想，这就是毛泽东思想。有了这个思想，才能保持旺盛的革命干劲，才有坚定正确的政治方向。”武汉邮电学院革命委员会的新老干部，牢记这一指示，从制订全院工作规划到处理日常事务，都以毛泽东思想作为根本的指导方针，谁的意见符合毛泽东思想，就照谁的办。
    复课闹革命初期，各班级纷纷提出计划，要到社会上做关于教育革命的调查，有的还要到上海，到广州去。负责具体抓教育革命工作的革委会委员，是个革命群众的代表。这位年轻干部很赞成到社会上做调查的计划，并且积极帮助同学们联系了一些工厂和施工单位。他高兴地把群众的要求告诉了教育革命领导小组的负责人、革命干部郭继姜，满以为会得到他的赞同。谁知郭继姜一听，就表示不同意。他说：“一个班一个班地往外走，这不符合毛主席关于复课闹革命的指示。同学们都走光了，谁来搞学校的斗、批、改呀！”这位新干部很不高兴地说：“这是群众的意见，你不同意就是脱离群众。”郭继姜说：“群众的意见有正确的，也有考虑不周到的。革命群众最听毛主席的话，我们坚持按照毛泽东思想办事，就不会脱离群众。”郭继姜坚持搞社会调查只能有计划地组织少数人去搞。
    这位新干部觉得领导意见和群众的要求相差太远了，认为事情不好办，再有同学来商量搞社会调查的事，他就干脆叫他们直接去找郭继姜。郭继姜这位体弱多病的老同志，参加革委会同青年干部一道工作以后，觉得自己年轻了许多。他不厌其烦地接待一批又一批的同学，一遍又一遍地耐心向他们讲道理。有时候还跑到班里去跟同学们谈心或者开展辩论，主动做说服工作。
    这位新干部看了郭继姜的这些作法，心里想：象老郭这样的革命老干部，处理问题就是能从长远着想，从全局出发。对于群众的意见，符合毛泽东思想的就接受，不符合毛泽东思想的就劝说。从表面上看，老郭是“顶”了来自群众的意见，但由于他坚持按照毛泽东思想办事，用毛主席的教导向群众作解释，实际上不仅没有脱离群众，相反却受到了群众更大的信任。于是，这位新干部也主动地把郭继姜的意见带到群众中去，同大家一起商量。许多同学对他说：“老郭的意见很对，应该按他的意见办。”并且积极建议由革命师生组成少而精的社会调查队，到附近的农村人民公社、工厂企业作调查。
    这位新干部把群众的这些反映告诉了郭继姜，郭继姜高兴地说：“‘群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的’，这是千真万确的真理。群众想的比我们更全面，更周到。的确群众最听毛主席的话，最能按照毛泽东思想办事！”这个新干部更加激动，他说：“现在我明白了一个真理：要不脱离群众，最根本的是要一时一刻也不脱离毛泽东思想。”
    教育革命领导小组把郭继姜提出的意见和群众的建议结合在一起，作出了统筹安排的决定，有力地推动了全校的斗、批、改。
    从此以后，这位新干部做事比过去细心多了，遇事总要用毛泽东思想衡量衡量，全面地考虑考虑。他和郭继姜的关系也更加密切，遇事充分交换意见，彼此合作得很好。　　世浩　大章（附图片）
