The flames of the revolutionary struggle of French workers and students are burning more fiercely. The volcanoes in the imperialist lairs of Europe and North America are erupting one after another. The flames of struggle are rapidly spreading to some capitalist countries, delivering a powerful blow to the decaying capitalist system. This great storm clearly indicates that the proletariat and working people of Europe, North America, and Oceania are in a new awakening.

The French and European and North American monopolistic bourgeoisie ruling clique, burned to a crisp by the revolutionary flames of the masses, face the increasingly surging, unprecedentedly fierce revolutionary struggle of workers and students, hating it to death and fearing it to the core. The French ruling clique uses counter-revolutionary two-faced tactics: on the one hand, they brazenly adopt a series of reactionary measures, dispatching large numbers of military and police to brutally suppress the workers and student masses; on the other hand, they hypocritically make minor economic concessions, increasing wages by a few francs to lure workers back to work, to divide and disintegrate the fighting ranks of workers and students, in an attempt to suppress this great revolutionary storm. However, whether they use the method of violent suppression or political deception, they cannot stop the struggle of the revolutionary people.

The great teacher Chairman Mao pointed out: "We must have a clear head, which includes not believing the 'good words' of imperialism and not fearing the threats of imperialism." Now, the workers, students, and revolutionary people of France and various countries in Europe and North America are facing an extremely sharp, complex, and arduous struggle. We firmly believe that the French working class and the broad masses of working people, with the glorious revolutionary tradition of the Paris Commune, as well as the revolutionary people of various countries in Europe and North America, will certainly see through all the tricks and conspiracies of the reactionary ruling clique and their accomplices, and persist in this great revolutionary struggle. Recently, the progressive students and workers in France, fearless of violence, have launched a new wave of struggle, engaging in sustained battles with reactionary military and police. This fully shows that once the masses awaken, their immense revolutionary potential will burst forth irresistibly.

All reactionaries are paper tigers. They are strong on the outside but weak on the inside, bullying the weak and fearing the strong. As long as the revolutionary people further strengthen their unity, persist in struggle, continuously expand their ranks, concentrate their firepower, and direct the spearhead of their struggle at the evil rule of the monopolistic bourgeoisie and the entire capitalist system, they will definitely achieve continuous victories in the revolutionary struggle.

Fight on, French workers and students, and the broad masses of working people in various countries of Europe and North America! The Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, together with the 700 million people of the entire nation, resolutely support your just struggle.

    坚持斗争就是胜利
    总后勤部机关无产阶级革命派
    法国工人、学生革命斗争的怒火越烧越旺。帝国主义老巢欧洲、北美的火山接连爆发。斗争的火焰正迅速地向一些资本主义国家蔓延，给予腐朽没落的资本主义制度以猛烈的冲击。这场伟大的风暴，鲜明地标志着“欧洲、北美和大洋洲的无产阶级和劳动人民，正处在新的觉醒之中。”
    被群众革命烈火烧得焦头烂额的法国和欧洲、北美垄断资产阶级统治集团，面对日益高涨、空前激烈的工人和学生的革命斗争，恨得要死，怕得要命。法国统治集团使用反革命两面手法：一方面悍然采取一系列反动措施，出动大批军警，残酷地镇压工人和学生群众；另一方面，又假惺惺地以在经济上微小的让步，增加几个法郎的工资来诱骗工人复工，分化瓦解工人和学生的战斗队伍，妄图把这场伟大的革命风暴压下去。但是，无论他们用武力镇压的一手还是用政治欺骗的一手，都阻挡不了革命人民的斗争。
    苏修、法修等叛徒集团和黄色工会头目，从这次革命风暴兴起之初，就恶毒攻击工人和学生的正义斗争，妄图软化工人和学生的斗志，挑拨工人和学生的战斗团结。他们无耻地充当了垄断资产阶级的帮凶。
    伟大导师毛主席指出：“我们要有清醒的头脑，这里包括不相信帝国主义的‘好话’和不害怕帝国主义的恐吓。”现在，法国工人、学生和欧洲、北美各国革命人民正面临着一场极其尖锐、复杂、艰巨的斗争。我们坚信，具有巴黎公社光荣革命传统的法国工人阶级和广大劳动人民，以及欧洲、北美各国革命人民，一定会识破反动统治集团及其帮凶们的一切阴谋诡计，把这场伟大的革命斗争坚持下去。最近，法国的进步学生和工人不畏强暴，掀起了新的斗争浪潮，同反动军警展开持续的搏斗。这就充分表明，当人民群众一旦觉醒，他们巨大的革命潜力就会不可遏止地迸发出来。
    一切反动派都是纸老虎。它们是外强中干、欺软怕硬的。革命人民只要进一步加强团结，坚持斗争，不断壮大自己的队伍，集中火力，把斗争的矛头指向垄断资产阶级的罪恶统治，指向整个资本主义制度，就一定能够取得革命斗争的不断胜利。
    战斗吧！法国工人和学生，欧洲、北美各国的广大劳动人民！用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民解放军与全国七亿人民一起，坚决支持你们的正义斗争。
