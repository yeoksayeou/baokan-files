    据新华社南京十日电　江苏无锡惠山农药厂广大革命职工紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓革命，猛促生产，全厂革命、生产呈现一派大好形势。主要产品二二三乳剂的产量，四月份比三月份增长了百分之三十，五月份又比四月份增长了百分之三十九。在这同时，他们还克服了重重困难，生产出了一批新农药“除草剂”。
    惠山农药厂革命职工遵照伟大领袖毛主席的“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，在厂革命委员会的带领下，向阶级敌人展开了主动的进攻。他们高举毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，展开了持久而深入的革命大批判，从而不断地提高了路线斗争的觉悟。他们还把革命大批判同本单位的阶级斗争形势紧密结合起来，揪出了一小撮隐藏在阴暗角落里的阶级敌人，粉碎了右倾翻案妖风，巩固了新生的革命委员会，保证了全厂生产的持续上升。
