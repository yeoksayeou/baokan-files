The revolutionary workers of Tianjin New Port, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist cadres, have earnestly implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. They have deeply carried out revolutionary criticism, launched a fierce attack on class enemies, and achieved a great leap forward in both revolution and production. In May, this port exceeded the transportation and loading/unloading tasks by 17.8 percent, setting a new monthly production record since its establishment. In the first half of June, the port's cargo throughput increased by 9.9 percent compared to the same period in May.

Tianjin New Port is the largest international trade port in northern China. For a long time, class struggles here have been extremely sharp and complex. Khrushchev of China and his agents in Tianjin have been colluding with enemies and promoting a counter-revolutionary revisionist line, attempting to restore capitalism. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a handful of class enemies spread the counter-revolutionary wind of economicism, incited anarchist tendencies, and sowed discord among workers, attempting to split the revolutionary ranks of the proletariat and disrupt revolution and production. However, the revolutionary workers of Tianjin New Port, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and supported by the People's Liberation Army's leftist cadres, followed Chairman Mao's teaching to "never forget class struggle." They launched a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies, smashed the enemies' plots, and consolidated the revolutionary great alliance and the newly established revolutionary committee.

Recently, the great leader Chairman Mao profoundly pointed out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution under the conditions of socialism, where the proletariat opposes the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary people it leads, and the Kuomintang reactionaries. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Chairman Mao's latest instructions have further armed the revolutionary workers. Under the leadership of the New Port Revolutionary Committee and with the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist cadres, the revolutionary workers strictly distinguish between the two types of contradictions, unite all revolutionary forces that can be united, and expose and criticize the stubborn walkers of the capitalist road, traitors, spies, and other counter-revolutionaries, one by one. This has promoted the development of revolution and production. The first loading/unloading team's production once declined due to the sabotage of class enemies. The revolutionary workers of this team studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, opened their eyes, exposed the bad elements, and exceeded the production plan in April and May. They completed the loading/unloading of a 10,000-ton ocean-going giant ship in 80 hours, with a loading/unloading efficiency increased by more than 30 percent compared to before.

After the establishment of the Tianjin New Port Revolutionary Committee, 114 sessions of various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes were held, with more than 90 percent of the revolutionary workers in the port participating in the study. Many family members also organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Revolutionary workers and their families regard the study classes as a battlefield for revolutionary criticism, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fiercely criticize Khrushchev of China's promotion of "bonus incentives" and "material stimulation" and other counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods. The revolutionary criticism has raised the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of revolutionary workers and their families, promoting thought revolutionization. Revolutionary workers regard loading and unloading one more ton of cargo as a heavy artillery shell fired at Khrushchev of China, as making one more contribution to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Since this spring, production in the entire port has been vigorously developed, with cargo throughput increasing month by month.

    大办毛泽东思想学习班　深入开展革命大批判
    天津新港创造建港以来月产最高纪录
    新华社天津十八日电　天津新港广大革命职工在人民解放军支左人员的帮助下，认真落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，深入开展革命大批判，向阶级敌人发起猛烈进攻，革命和生产呈现一派大好景象。五月份这个港口超额百分之十七点八完成了运输装卸任务，创造了建港以来月产最高纪录。六月份上半月全港货物吞吐量，又比五月份同期增加百分之九点九。
    天津新港是我国北方最大的国际贸易港口。长期以来，这里的阶级斗争一直十分尖锐复杂。中国赫鲁晓夫及其在天津的代理人，在这个港口招降纳叛，推行反革命修正主义路线，妄图复辟资本主义。在无产阶级文化大革命中，一小撮阶级敌人大刮反革命经济主义妖风，煽动无政府主义思潮，在工人中间挑拨离间，妄图分裂无产阶级革命队伍，破坏革命和生产。但是，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的天津新港广大革命职工，在人民解放军支左人员的支持下，遵照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，向一小撮阶级敌人发动了猛烈进攻，粉碎了阶级敌人的阴谋活动，巩固了革命的大联合和新生的革命委员会。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”毛主席的这一最新指示，进一步武装了广大革命职工。在新港革命委员会领导和解放军支左人员帮助下，革命职工严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，团结一切可以团结的革命力量，把顽固不化的走资派、叛徒、特务和其他反革命分子，一个个地揪了出来，对他们的反革命罪行进行了大揭发、大批判，从而推动了革命和生产的发展。第一装卸队由于阶级敌人的破坏，生产一度下降。这个队的革命职工学习了毛主席的最新指示，擦亮了眼睛，揪出了坏人，四、五月份都超额完成了生产计划。他们用八十个小时完成了万吨远洋巨轮的装卸任务，装卸效率比过去提高了百分之三十以上。
    天津新港革命委员会成立后，举办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班一百一十四期，使全港百分之九十以上的革命职工参加了学习，很多家属也组织起来，办起了毛泽东思想学习班。革命职工和家属把学习班当做革命大批判的战场，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫推行的“奖金挂帅”、“物质刺激”等反革命修正主义黑货。革命的大批判，提高了革命职工和家属的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，促进了思想革命化。广大革命职工把多装多卸一吨货物，看作是射向中国赫鲁晓夫的一发重型炮弹，看作是对无产阶级文化大革命多作出一分贡献。今春以来，全港生产蓬蓬勃勃地发展，货物吞吐量一月比一月上升。
