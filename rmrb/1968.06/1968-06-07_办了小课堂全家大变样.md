Our great leader Chairman Mao issued the call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism." After that, I thought about setting up a small study group for learning Chairman Mao's thoughts at home.

One day, I mentioned this idea. At the time, the family's opinions were divided. My eldest son, Che Jiufu, enthusiastically supported it, but my wife's thoughts were not so clear. She said, "At this age, let the children handle these things. Whether or not to study, I am just a cook." I am someone who has come out of hardship. If anyone is not enthusiastic about studying Chairman Mao's thoughts, to be honest, I get angry. I said to my wife, "If everyone thinks like you, our country will change, and you, who cooks big meals, will become someone who begs for big meals." As soon as I mentioned begging, her face changed color. Seeing that she was silent, my anger also subsided. To awaken her consciousness, I told the family about how my mother died because she couldn't afford medicine in the old society, and how my younger siblings starved to death because they had no food to eat, as well as my own bitter history of begging for food with my father. As I spoke, my wife and the children all started crying. I changed the subject and said, "Jiufu's mother, we all grew up in hardship. Have you thought about it? Without Chairman Mao, could we have today?" My eldest son picked up the thread and said, "Mom, we set up a family study group to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's thoughts, to be forever loyal to Chairman Mao, and to revolutionize with Chairman Mao for life, never to suffer again!" My wife wiped her tears and nodded. With my wife's thoughts clarified, the family study group was established.

To run the family study group well, we must focus on the word "loyalty." I, who have experienced the bitterness of the old society and tasted the sweetness of the new society, should say that I am genuinely loyal to Chairman Mao. But are there still places where I am not so loyal? Yes, there are! So, in the study group, I exposed my past thoughts of not wanting to be the team leader and wanting to quit. As soon as I finished speaking, my second daughter, Che Jiuhua, interrupted, "This is selfishness, which means you are not loyal to our great leader Chairman Mao." My second daughter is only fourteen years old, but she can criticize me so sharply. I was genuinely happy. I thought she might not understand deeply, so I deliberately said, "You say I have selfishness, I admit it, but how can you say I am not loyal to Chairman Mao?" This stirred up a hornet's nest, and the whole family's criticism was directed at me. One said, "You have forgotten your roots, how can you be called loyal!" Another said, "You are selfish, how can you be called loyal." My second daughter also read two passages from Chairman Mao's quotations for me: "All revolutionary struggles are for the purpose of seizing power, consolidating power." "Hard work is like a burden placed before us, see if we dare to undertake it. The burden is light or heavy. Some people pick the light ones and push the heavy ones to others, taking the light ones for themselves. This is not a good attitude." My eldest son also said seriously, "Whether or not to be the team leader, this is a big issue of who holds power. Dad often tells us about the hardships of the old society, but why did you suffer in the old society? Wasn't it because we poor and lower-middle peasants did not hold power? Today, we poor and lower-middle peasants are in charge. Dad doesn't want to be the team leader, isn't this forgetting Chairman Mao's teachings, not being loyal to Chairman Mao?"

I didn't expect them to use Chairman Mao's thoughts so well! I said, "Your criticism is correct, this is a manifestation of my disloyalty to Chairman Mao. In the future, I will definitely take on the responsibility of the team leader well, hold power for the poor and lower-middle peasants, and use power well." When the children criticized me, I noticed that my second son had not spoken. I asked him, "Everyone has criticized me, why don't you speak?" He said, "I heard what everyone said just now, I thought about it, I also have many 'selfish' thoughts. The other day, I brought back two small wooden sticks cut from the team, this harms the collective interests, and is also disloyal to Chairman Mao!" As he spoke, this little fellow started crying. After a while, he said, "I will change, I will take these two wooden sticks back to the team right away." My second son's actions moved the whole family, so everyone in the family took the initiative to expose their selfishness and decided to be loyal to Chairman Mao.

The small study group of Chairman Mao's thoughts has already transformed my family. In the past, we talked about small families and private plots, but now everyone cares about national affairs and fights selfishness and criticizes revisionism. Even my illiterate wife can recite Chairman Mao's quotations, reciting ten or more at a time, and when she talks about Chairman Mao's great achievements, she can talk for a long time.

### 办了小课堂全家大变样

    办了小课堂全家大变样
    辽宁宽甸县步达远公社新生大队二队政治队长　车兴德
    自从我们伟大领袖毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召后，我就琢磨在家里也办起一个学习毛泽东思想的小课堂。
    有一天，我把这个主意说出来。当时，全家人的意见有些分歧。大儿子车久福积极支持，老伴的思想可不那么通。她说：“这么大岁数了，这些事，让孩子们去干吧。学习不学习，我是个做大饭的。”我这个人是从苦水里爬出来的，谁要对学习毛泽东思想不热情，说实在的，我就有气。我对老伴说：“要都象你这个思想，咱们这个国家就会变了，你这个做大饭的就会变成要大饭的了。”一提起要饭来，她的脸色一下就变了。看她不吱声了，我的气也就消下去了。为了启发她的觉悟，我向全家讲起在旧社会我妈妈因为无钱买药病死了，弟弟妹妹因为没有饭吃饿死了，以及我跟着爸爸要大饭的悲惨史。讲着，讲着，我老伴和几个孩子都哭了。我转过话题说：“久福他妈，咱们都是在苦水里泡着长大的，你想没想，要没有毛主席，能有咱们今天吗？”我大小子接上话茬说：“妈，咱们办家庭小课堂，就是为了活学活用毛泽东思想，为了永远忠于毛主席，跟毛主席干一辈子革命，再不吃二遍苦啊！”我老伴一边抹泪，一边直点头。老伴思想通了，家庭小课堂就办起来了。
    要办好家庭小课堂，就要在“忠”字上狠下功夫。我这个吃尽了旧社会的苦，也尝到了新社会的甜的人，应该说对毛主席是打心眼里忠的。可是还有没有不那么忠的地方呢？有！于是我就在小课堂上把自己过去不想当队长，想撂挑子的活思想亮了出来。话音刚落，我那二姑娘车久花就插嘴说：“你这是私心，也就是对我们伟大的领袖毛主席不忠。”我二姑娘才十四岁，就能对我提出这样尖锐的批评，我真是打心眼里高兴。我以为她认识得不一定很深刻，就故意板着脸说：“你说我有私心我承认，可怎么能说我对毛主席不忠呢？”这一下，可捅了马蜂窝了，全家的矛头一起对准了我。这个说，你忘了本，怎么能算忠！那个说，你自私自利，怎么能算忠。二姑娘还为我读了两段毛主席语录：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固权政。”“艰苦的工作就象担子，摆在我们的面前，看我们敢不敢承担。担子有轻有重。有的人拈轻怕重，把重担子推给人家，自己拣轻的挑。这就不是好的态度。”大小子也严肃地说：“当不当队长，这是关系到什么人掌权的大问题，爹经常给我们讲旧社会受的苦，可你为什么在旧社会受苦？那不就是因为咱们贫下中农没有掌权吗？今天，咱们贫下中农当家做主了，爹还不想当队长，这不就是不想为贫下中农掌权吗？爹这样做，不就是忘了毛主席的教导，对毛主席不忠吗？”
    我没想到他们对毛泽东思想用得还真不离呢！我说：“你们批评得对，我这是对毛主席不忠的表现，今后，我保证把队长担子好好挑起来，为咱贫下中农掌好权，用好权。”在孩子们批评我的时候，我发现我那二小子一直没吱声。我问他：“大家都对我提出批评，你怎么不发言呢？”他说：“刚才你们说的我都听到了，我想想，我也有很多‘私’字。前天，我把队里砍的两根小木杆扛回咱们家，这是损害集体利益，也是对毛主席的不忠啊！”说着，说着，这小家伙竟哭起来了。停了一会儿，他又说：“我保证改，一会儿就把这两根木杆送到队里去。”俺二小子的行动感动了全家，于是，全家每个人都争先亮了私，决心忠于毛主席。
    毛泽东思想小课堂，已经使我这一家大变样。过去开口小家庭，闭口自留地，现在是人人关心国家大事，个个斗私批修。连不识字的老伴，也背起毛主席语录，一背十几条，讲起毛主席的丰功伟绩，一讲一大套了。
