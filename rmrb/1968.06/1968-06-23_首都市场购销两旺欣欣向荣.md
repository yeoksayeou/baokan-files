The revolutionary masses on the financial and commercial front in the capital, following Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production," are vigorously carrying out class struggle, using revolution to drive production, and actively doing a good job in the procurement, allocation, and supply of commodities.

Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd: Amidst the triumphant songs of the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad masses of revolutionary workers on the financial and commercial front in the capital, following Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production," are vigorously carrying out class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and actively doing a good job in the procurement, allocation, and supply of commodities. The socialist market in the capital's cities and countryside is presenting a prosperous and thriving revolutionary scene.

Since this year, the market situation in the capital has been getting better and better. The procurement volume of daily industrial products and agricultural sideline products has been increasing month by month, the variety and types of commodities have been becoming more and more abundant, the commodities transported to rural areas and other places have been increasing, and the commodity inventory has been increasing day by day. The monthly procurement volume of cotton cloth, knitted products, matches, detergent, soap, radios, aluminum pots, light bulbs, and other major daily necessities has increased significantly compared to the beginning of the year. Large quantities of textiles, cultural supplies, Chinese and Western medicines, and chemical products are being continuously transported to other places. Currently, from large department stores such as Beijing Department Store, Beijing Food Market, and Xidan Vegetable Market to the supply and marketing cooperatives scattered throughout the countryside, daily industrial products and various sideline food products such as meat, eggs, and vegetables are abundant, and sales are brisk.

The prosperous and thriving market situation in the cities and countryside of the capital is a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and a bountiful fruit of Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production." The vigorous revolutionary situation on the industrial front in Beijing has promoted the steady development of industrial production. The light industry and textile industry systems, which are closely related to people's lives, have been reporting victories frequently in recent months, with production booming, providing a rich material foundation for the prosperity of the market.

The financial and commercial system in Beijing has long been a fierce battleground for the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary factions in this system, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, after seizing power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, carried out thorough revolutionary spirit, united the majority of revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, launched a fierce attack on the class enemies, making a handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and other counter-revolutionaries fall into the vast ocean of people's war, and smashed the rightist reversal wind stirred up by this handful of class enemies. The broad masses of revolutionary workers on the financial and commercial front, together with the workers of various factories and mines in Beijing and the Red Guards, jointly fought against speculation and profiteering activities, defending the socialist planned economy. From the municipal financial and commercial bureaus and professional companies to the grassroots stores, the flames of revolutionary criticism are burning more fiercely. Revolutionary workers, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, deeply expose and criticize the series of reactionary fallacies such as the "extinction of class struggle," "profit-first," and "target-first" spread by Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in various industries and units. They vigorously study and implement Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production," significantly enhancing their awareness of class struggle and line struggle, further clarifying the fundamental differences between socialist commerce and capitalist commerce, and profoundly changing the spiritual face and appearance of the enterprise. They proudly declare: "We commercial workers will be dedicated servants of the people, propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought, and fighters defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line."

The broad masses of revolutionary workers in the supply and marketing cooperative system actively undertake the glorious political task of distributing Chairman Mao's works, Chairman Mao's portraits, and Chairman Mao's badges to the suburban countryside, and universally set up Mao Zedong Thought propaganda stations or treasure book stands. Now, several million poor and lower-middle peasants in the suburbs can buy Chairman Mao's works without leaving their villages. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are very satisfied with this.

Currently, the broad masses of revolutionary workers on the financial and commercial front are determined to take Comrade Deng Zihui as a shining example, to be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, to continue to actively launch fierce attacks on the class enemies, to do a better job in the procurement, market supply, and service of industrial products and agricultural sideline products, and to achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    首都市场购销两旺欣欣向荣
    财贸战线广大革命职工，遵循毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，狠抓阶级斗争，用革命带动生产，积极作好商品的收购、调拨、供应工作
    新华社二十二日讯 在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，首都财贸战线上的无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，遵循毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争，积极作好商品的收购、调拨、供应工作，首都城乡社会主义市场呈现一派欣欣向荣的大好革命景象。
    今年以来，首都市场形势越来越好。日用工业品和农副产品的收购量逐月上升，商品的花色品种越来越丰富，调运农村和外地的商品越来越多，商品库存日益增加。棉布、针织品、火柴、洗衣粉、肥皂、收音机、铝锅、灯泡等多种主要生活用品的月收购量比年初有大幅度增长。大批纺织品、文化用品、中西药品和化工类商品源源运往外地。目前，从北京市百货大楼、北京食品商场、西单菜市场等大型商场到遍布农村的供销社里，日用工业品和肉类、蛋品、蔬菜等各种副食品琳琅满目，销售活跃。
    首都城乡市场商品丰富、购销两旺的大好形势，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，是毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针结出的丰硕成果。北京工业战线轰轰烈烈的革命形势，推动了工业生产的稳步发展。与人民生活有密切关系的轻工业、纺织工业系统，近几个月来捷报频传，生产蒸蒸日上，为市场繁荣提供了丰厚的物质基础。
    北京市财贸系统长期以来两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争很激烈。在无产阶级文化大革命中，这个系统的无产阶级革命派，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在夺了党内一小撮走资派的权之后，发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，团结大多数革命群众和革命干部，向阶级敌人发起猛烈的进攻，使一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派和其他反革命分子陷入“人民战争”的汪洋大海，粉碎了这一小撮阶级敌人刮起的右倾翻案妖风。财贸战线广大革命职工还和北京市各厂矿的工人以及红卫兵小将共同作战，有力地打击了投机倒把活动，保卫了社会主义计划经济。从市属财贸各局、专业公司到基层商店，革命大批判的烈火越烧越旺，革命职工以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为锐利武器，深揭猛批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在各行业各单位的代理人散布的“阶级斗争熄灭”论、“利润挂帅”、“指标第一”等一系列反动谬论，大力学习和贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，阶级斗争观念和路线斗争觉悟有很大提高，进一步认清了社会主义商业和资本主义商业的根本区别，人的精神面貌和企业的面貌发生了深刻变化。他们豪迈地表示：“我们商业职工要做全心全意为人民服务的勤务员、毛泽东思想宣传员、捍卫毛主席革命路线的战斗员。”
    供销社系统的广大革命职工积极承担起向郊区农村发行毛主席著作、毛主席像和毛主席像章的光荣政治任务，普遍设立起毛泽东思想宣传站或宝书台。现在郊区几百万贫下中农不出村就能买到毛主席著作。广大贫下中农对此非常满意。
      目前，广大财贸战线革命职工决心以门合同志为光辉榜样，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，继续主动地向阶级敌人猛烈进攻，把工业品和农副产品的收购、市场供应和服务工作做得更好，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利立新功。
