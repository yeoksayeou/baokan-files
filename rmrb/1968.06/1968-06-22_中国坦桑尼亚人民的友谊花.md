On the evening of June 21, after the grand farewell banquet hosted by President Nyerere and his wife had just concluded, a performance by young Tanzanian acrobatic students immediately began. The show featured one act after another, and the audience frequently erupted in enthusiastic applause.

The performance ended. President Nyerere and other distinguished guests who watched the show, along with Premier Zhou Enlai, happily walked onto the stage and shook hands warmly with the performers, expressing their congratulations. Many audience members also praised, saying that the Tanzanian students, who had only studied in China for over two years, were able to achieve such good results. This is a glory for the Tanzanian people and a flower of friendship cultivated by the Chinese and Tanzanian peoples.

The Tanzanian acrobatic students arrived in China in November 1965. These students were all teenagers. The Tanzanian government and people entrusted China with the education of their young children, which is a very good manifestation of the friendship between the two countries and their peoples. Over the past two years, due to the students' diligent study and the guidance of the Wuhan Acrobatic Troupe, they have grown rapidly and become Tanzania's first batch of acrobatic performers. The Tanzanian students happily said: Studying in socialist China under the leadership of Chairman Mao is our happiness!

During their studies, the Tanzanian students understood the principle that art should serve the people, and therefore, they studied the techniques very seriously. To master the basics and rehearse new acts, they did not mind sweating profusely or feeling sore in the waist and legs. When encountering difficulties, they followed the example of their Chinese friends, reciting Chairman Mao's quotes: "Resolutely carry out the decision, fear no sacrifice, and overcome all difficulties to win victory." They finally overcame one obstacle after another and learned many acrobatic skills. Student Omar, when he first started learning, had difficulty stretching his waist and legs. His Chinese friends advised him to rest, but he refused and even practiced more in his spare time. Therefore, he quickly mastered some relatively complex techniques. After more than two years of study, these intelligent and brave Tanzanian students can now perform solo on stage. The Tanzanian students were excited about the achievements they had made in such a short time, saying that this was a miracle achieved with the help of their Chinese friends.

To strengthen the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Tanzanian peoples, the Chinese comrades responsible for training adopted the teaching method of personal example, demonstrating movements multiple times and jumping and rolling with the students day after day. In such teaching, the sweat of the two countries' friends often flowed together on the practice ground, jointly nurturing the flower of friendship between the Chinese and Tanzanian peoples.

May the fighting friendship between China and the Tanzanian and African peoples forever bloom like a vibrant flower!

    中国坦桑尼亚人民的友谊花
    六月二十一日晚上，尼雷尔总统和夫人举行的盛大告别宴会刚刚结束，一个由年轻的坦桑尼亚杂技学员们演出的晚会，紧接着开始了。晚会上，节目演了一个又一个，观众席上不时响起阵阵热烈的掌声。
    演出结束了。观看演出的尼雷尔总统等贵宾和周恩来总理，高兴地走上舞台，同演员们亲切握手，表示祝贺。许多观众也称赞说，坦桑尼亚学员在中国只学习了两年多，能取得这样的好成绩，这是坦桑尼亚人民的光荣，也是中国和坦桑尼亚人民用友谊培育出的一枝花朵。
    坦桑尼亚杂技学员是一九六五年十一月间来到中国的。这批学员都是十几岁的少年，坦桑尼亚政府和人民委托中国培育他们的年轻子女，这正是两国和两国人民友谊的一个很好的表现。两年多来，由于学员们努力学习和武汉杂技团的指导，他们已经迅速成长起来，成为坦桑尼亚的第一批杂技演员。坦桑尼亚学员高兴地说：在毛主席领导下的社会主义中国学习，这是我们的幸福！
    在学习中，坦桑尼亚学员懂得了文艺必须为人民服务的道理，因此，学习技术非常认真。为了练好基本功和排练新节目，他们不顾汗流浃背，不怕腰酸腿疼。遇有困难时，他们就学习中国朋友的作法，朗读毛主席语录：
  “下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”他们终于突破了一个个难关，学会了很多杂技。学员欧马里在开始学的时候，腰腿伸展不灵便，中国朋友要他休息，他不肯，而且在课外时间也加紧练习，因此很快地掌握了一些比较复杂的技巧。经过两年多的学习，这些聪明、勇敢的坦桑尼亚学员，现在已经能够单独登台表演了。坦桑尼亚学员都为他们自己在短短的时间内取得这样的成绩感到兴奋，说这是在中国朋友帮助下取得的奇迹。
    为了加强中国和坦桑尼亚人民的战斗友谊，担任教练工作的中国同志，遵循毛主席的教导，把培训坦桑尼亚学员，当作一项应尽的国际主义义务。为了克服语言不通的困难，他们采用了身教的办法，多次地作示范动作，连日累月地和学员们在一起翻滚腾跳。在这样的教学中，两国朋友的汗水常常一起流在练习场地上，共同浇灌了坦桑尼亚杂技团这朵中国和坦桑尼亚人民的友谊花。
    愿中国同坦桑尼亚和非洲人民的战斗友谊，象鲜艳的花朵，永远开放！　新华社记者
