Albanian workers enthusiastically respond to the battle call of the Albanian Labor Party, actively supporting agricultural production and socialist construction in rural areas with practical actions.

Workers from various industrial sectors are providing comprehensive and effective assistance to agricultural cooperatives and agricultural enterprises with high revolutionary enthusiasm. Workers at the Ferizaj Fertilizer Plant produced 3.7% more nitrogen fertilizer in the first quarter of this year than originally planned. Workers at the Superphosphate Plant exceeded the original plan by 9.3% in production, and they are already mobilized to strive to provide ten times the amount of chemical fertilizers imported in 1965 to agriculture this year.

Workers at Albania's machinery factories are also providing great help to agricultural laborers by supplying them with agricultural machinery and tools. Albania's machinery industry has seen new developments, and now it can produce more than one million tools per year and meet most of the rural demand for tractor parts.

Workers at the Durres Agricultural Machinery Factory continuously supply agricultural machinery and equipment in large quantities. Workers at the Durres Agricultural Machinery Factory are also continuously increasing the production of threshers.

Other agricultural machinery factories, such as the "Dinamo" Factory and the "Partisan" Factory in Tirana, the Korça Machinery Factory, and others, have also produced a batch of agricultural machinery for agricultural production.

In recent years, it has become a trend for workers, intellectuals, and cadres to go to the mountains and countryside to participate in voluntary labor for agricultural production. Many factories and enterprises have set up special workshops to produce tools and machinery needed to support agriculture, and materials and equipment needed for the electrification of rural areas. To help rural areas cultivate and train agricultural technical personnel, many factories and enterprises have also set up training classes, and have organized urban and rural workers and members of agricultural cooperatives in various districts to visit and learn from each other in an organized manner. This has greatly strengthened the ties between urban and rural laborers and between factories and enterprises and rural areas, promoting socialist construction in rural areas.

    阿尔巴尼亚工人大力支援农业生产
    据新华社地拉那电　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道：阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级热烈响应阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的战斗号召，以实际行动大力支援农业生产和农村社会主义建设。
    各产业部门的工人以高昂的革命干劲，正在向农业生产合作社和农业企业提供全面和有效的援助。费里氮肥厂的工人们在今年第一季度生产的氮肥比原订计划多百分之三点七；过磷酸盐厂的职工比原计划增产了百分之九点三的产品，职工们已经动员起来，争取在今年向农业提供十倍于一九六五年进口的化学肥料。
    阿尔巴尼亚的机器厂的职工们也给农业劳动者以巨大的帮助，向他们提供农业机器和农具。阿尔巴尼亚的机械工业有了新的发展，现在它一年可以生产一百万件以上的工具，并满足农村对拖拉机零件的大部分的需要。
    都拉斯农业机械厂的工人们不断以大量的农业机器和设备供应农业。
    都拉斯农业机械厂的工人们还不断增产打谷机。
    其他农机厂，如地拉那的“狄纳莫”工厂和“游击队”工厂、科尔察的机械厂等等，也为农业生产了一批农业机器。
    近几年来，工人、知识分子和干部上山下乡参加农业生产的义务劳动蔚然成风。许多工厂、企业设立了专门车间生产支援农业需要的工具和机器，制造农村实现电气化所需要的物资和器材。为了帮助农村培养和训练农业技术人员，许多工厂企业还开办了训练班，有计划地组织城乡工人和各区农业生产合作社社员进行互相访问和学习，从而大大密切了城乡劳动人民之间以及工厂企业和农村之间的联系，促进了农村的社会主义建设。
