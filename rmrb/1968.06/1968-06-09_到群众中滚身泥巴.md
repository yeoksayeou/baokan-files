    Roll in the Mud Among the Masses

    Vice Chairman Yu Jing of the County Revolutionary Committee, formerly the first deputy county magistrate, is now in charge of the Production Command Department. Initially, he continued his old ways, busy in the office setting targets, chasing numbers, and listening to reports. When the Revolutionary Committee began its rectification campaign, the masses criticized him, saying, "You've brought your old habits into the new organization!" Yu Jing felt that the masses' criticism had hit the nail on the head.

    He seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "All correct tasks, policies, and work styles are in harmony with the demands of the masses at that time and place, and are connected with the masses." Chairman Mao's teachings were like a golden key that unlocked the lock in Yu Jing's heart. He recalled that in the past, the Chinese Khrushchev had vigorously promoted the revisionist line of focusing only on work and neglecting ideology, isolating us from the masses and leading us astray. The more he thought about it, the more dangerous and fearful he felt. He decided to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, frequently go among the masses, and use his actions to draw a clear line with the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev. From then on, Yu Jing often appeared in the fields, at the edges of the fields, and on construction sites with his backpack, conducting investigations among the masses and practicing face-to-face leadership. The masses praised, "Yu Jing has come to our midst!"

    In March of this year, the water conservancy project of relocating the Shuanglong River began. Yu Jing, along with over ten thousand workers, threw himself into the battle. He participated in labor while investigating among the masses, discovering and cultivating model examples to guide the overall work. In his joint struggle with the workers, he discovered that the workers of Taizhang Village used their spare time to organize Mao Zedong Thought study classes, turning the construction site into a battlefield for criticizing and repudiating selfishness and revisionism. This method was excellent. For example, in the past, due to the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents pushing revisionist goods on the water conservancy construction sites, at the junctions of two units, people often dug less with their shovels and carried less with their baskets. As a result, when the project was completed, there were walls left on the construction site. This often caused disputes between units. This time, in the study classes on the construction site, the revolutionary masses of Taizhang Village, armed with Chairman Mao's teachings on "completely selfless and dedicated to the people" and "wholeheartedly serving the people," criticized and repudiated the revisionist goods of the Chinese Khrushchev. The workers' political awareness was raised, and their resolve to work for socialism was strengthened. They compared the walls to "revisionist walls." Many said, "Digging one more shovel of 'revisionist wall' reduces one's selfishness and increases one's public spirit." Not only were there no walls left on their construction site, but the work efficiency also continued to improve. Yu Jing promptly helped the workers of Taizhang Village summarize their experiences and organized all the workers to hold an on-site meeting at this village's construction site to promote their methods. The entire construction site launched a wave of learning from and catching up to Taizhang Village, which strongly promoted the progress of the project. The project, originally planned to be completed in thirty days, was finished in just fifteen days.

    Reflecting on this experience, Yu Jing deeply felt, "We cadres must take root among the masses, roll in the mud, and work until our hands are calloused, to eliminate the old bureaucratic style and better serve the masses."

    到群众中滚身泥巴
    县革命委员会副主任于静，原来是第一副县长，现在分工负责生产指挥部。开初一段时间，他还象过去一样，忙于在机关里订指标，抓数字，听汇报。革命委员会开门整风的时候，群众批评他说：“你把老作风带进了新机构！”于静同志觉得群众一针见血的批评，刺中了自己的要害。
    他认真学习了毛主席的教导：“凡属正确的任务、政策和工作作风，都是和当时当地的群众要求相适合，都是联系群众的”。毛主席的教导象一把金钥匙，打开了于静的心头锁。他回想到，过去，中国赫鲁晓夫极力推行只抓业务、不抓思想的修正主义路线，把我们同群众隔离，使我们走上邪路。他越想越感觉危险，越感觉后怕。他决心按照毛主席的教导，经常深入到群众中去，用自己的实际行动，同中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线划清界限。从此，于静就经常带着背包出现在田间、地头、工地上，在群众中调查研究，实行面对面的领导。群众称赞说：“老于到我们中间来了！”
    今年三月份，双龙河改道的水利工程开工。于静同志也和一万多民工一起投入了战斗。他一边深入群众参加劳动，一边发现典型，培养典型，用来指导全面。在和民工的共同战斗中，他发现台张庄大队的民工，利用业余时间大办毛泽东思想学习班，把工地变为斗私批修的战场，这种作法很好。例如，过去由于中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在水利工地大肆推行修正主义黑货，在两个单位的工程交界处，人们往往少挖一锹，少抬一筐，结果工程结束时，工地上便留下了一堵堵“界墙”。为此，常常闹得单位之间不团结。这次在工地学习班里，台张庄大队的革命群众，以毛主席关于“毫不利己专门利人”和“全心全意地为人民服务”的教导为武器，人人口诛笔伐，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义黑货。广大民工提高了政治觉悟，坚定了为社会主义而劳动的决心。他们把“界墙”比作“修字墙”。许多人说：“多挖一锹‘修字墙’，就少一份私心，增加一份公心。”他们的工地上不仅没有留下“界墙”，而且施工效率不断提高。于静及时帮助台张庄大队的民工总结了经验，组织全体民工到这个大队的工地开现场会加以推广。整个工地掀起了学、赶台张庄大队的热潮，有力地推动了工程的进展。原计划三十天完成的工程，十五天就全部竣工。
    于静回顾这段经历，深有体会地说：“我们干部只有扎根群众，滚身泥巴，手上磨出茧子，才能打掉官僚主义的旧作风，更好地为群众服务。”
