Jinan Building Materials Repair Factory's revolutionary workers have put politics in command and carried forward the spirit of self-reliance, successfully developing a brick-pressing machine with eight molds that utilizes industrial waste such as furnace slag to produce building bricks. This eight-hole brick-pressing machine has a simple and compact structure, making it easy to manufacture and maintain. Its creation will significantly promote the utilization of industrial waste and prevent the waste of large amounts of farmland that would otherwise be used for making clay bricks.

The Ministry of Building Materials Industry recently held a technical appraisal meeting at Jinan Building Materials Repair Factory. Representatives from more than ten provinces and municipalities across the country participated in the meeting. They unanimously praised the eight-hole brick-pressing machine for its excellent technical performance and economic benefits.

    济南建材机修厂制成八孔压砖机
    济南建材机修厂广大革命职工突出无产阶级政治，发扬自力更生的革命精神，试制成功一台利用炉渣等废料压制建筑用砖的八孔压砖机。这种八孔压砖机结构简单紧凑，加工维修都很方便。它的诞生将大大促进工业废物的利用，避免因制造土砖而用掉大量农田。
    建筑材料工业部最近在济南建材机修厂召开技术鉴定会，全国十多个省市有关方面的代表参加了会议，他们一致称赞八孔压砖机的技术性能和经济效果良好。
