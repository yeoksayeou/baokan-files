Also accompanying the Malian military delegation to visit southern China was the acting charge d'affaires of the Malian Embassy in China, Moussa Koulibaly.

At the airport to see them off were also ambassadors from African countries to China and military attaches from various countries' embassies in China.

The Malian military delegation, led by Malian Republic's Minister-level representative for defense and security Mamadou Diakit, accompanied by Vice Minister of China's Ministry of National Defense Xiao Jinguang, visited several units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in Beijing, including the Beijing Military Region and the Air Force, as well as the Beijing Knitting Factory. The delegation was warmly welcomed by the PLA soldiers and workers everywhere they went.

During their visit, the Malian friends enthusiastically praised our great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They highly evaluated the great Chinese People's Liberation Army, personally created and led by our great leader Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, and warmly praised the great Chinese people armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

After listening to the introduction by the PLA support-left personnel at the Beijing Knitting Factory about their experiences, Mamadou Diakit, the delegation leader, said, "Through our visit, we have seen how the Chinese People's Liberation Army is armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Your army is truly a people's army. We hope you will continue to study Mao Zedong Thought and master it. Because you have mastered Mao Zedong Thought, you will not only contribute to the Chinese people but also to the people of the world."

After listening to the introduction by the responsible person of a certain unit of the PLA Air Force about the situation of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in action, and watching the flight demonstration, Mamadou Diakit, the delegation leader, said, "The visit has been very beneficial to us. We have seen that the Chinese people not only possess modern weapons but are also armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, the Chinese people are invincible."

Mamadou Diakit, the delegation leader, also said during his visit, "Chairman Mao's thoughts not only bring happiness to the Chinese people but also to the people of the world. Long live Chairman Mao's revolutionary spirit! Wish Chairman Mao eternal life!"
