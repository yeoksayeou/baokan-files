The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Paper Mill have successfully trial-produced thin letterpress paper for printing the pocket edition of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," making a contribution to the promotion of the great Mao Zedong Thought.

	The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Paper Mill have responded resolutely to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production." They have fought the production battle as a political battle, grasped revolution, and promoted production, achieving new successes in the production of paper for Chairman Mao's works.

	Under the leadership of the revolutionary committee, the revolutionary workers of the Beijing Paper Mill have followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, carried out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, greatly enhanced their class struggle consciousness and awareness of the struggle between the two lines, deepened their boundless class feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, and strengthened their sense of responsibility for promoting the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The workers say, "Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. Liu Shaoqi opposes the promotion of Mao Zedong Thought, so we must strive to produce more paper for Chairman Mao's works and contribute to the promotion of Mao Zedong Thought." The workers of the Forward Sub-factory, with their boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, have carried out scientific experiments, overcome numerous difficulties, and for the first time produced thin letterpress paper for printing the pocket edition of "Quotations from Chairman Mao."

	When the Forward Sub-factory first accepted the task of trial-producing thin letterpress paper, some technical "authorities" raised a series of difficulties, saying that imported equipment and foreign raw materials were necessary. Workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought were very indignant and said: In the past, the anti-revolutionary revisionist clique of Peng Zhen, in collusion with the capitalist roaders in the factory, did everything possible to obstruct the production of paper for Chairman Mao's works, claiming that the factory's conditions were poor and that high-grade paper could not be produced, and absurdly proposed that "equipment determines everything." The capitalist roaders in the factory even openly shouted, "The production of thin letterpress paper has low profits, low output, and is meaningless." Today, some technical "authorities" who believe in foreign doctrines are obstructing our production of thin letterpress paper, which is absolutely unacceptable.

	The workers clearly realized that the production of thin letterpress paper is not just a general production task, but a political battle and a sharp struggle between the two lines. They decided to act according to Chairman Mao's teachings on self-reliance and hard struggle, break away from superstition, liberate their minds, rely on the collective wisdom and strength, and absolutely not let the technical "authorities" lead them by the nose. The workers said: To let Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts spread all over the world, we will not eat or sleep until we produce the thin letterpress paper. When they encountered difficulties, they sat down and repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "What is work? Work is struggle." The production of this paper requires a large amount of auxiliary materials. Without equipment for dissolving auxiliary materials, they made do with what they had, using large and small pots as substitutes. Without auxiliary material storage equipment, they used pulp pits as substitutes. After days and nights of struggle, the revolutionary workers finally broke through the shackles of foreign doctrines and frameworks, and self-reliantly produced thin letterpress paper in a short period.

	Following the success of the Forward Sub-factory in trial-producing thin letterpress paper, various factories have successively carried out experiments and reforms. The revolutionary workers of the Paper Mill No. 1 have dared to take the lead and produced thin letterpress paper using all self-made bleached grass pulp on the round net paper machine.

	Through continuous struggle against class enemies and anarchist trends, the whole factory has achieved remarkable results in grasping revolution and promoting production. Last year, the output of paper increased by 12.7% compared to 1966, and the production of paper for Chairman Mao's works increased several times. Currently, the varieties of paper for Chairman Mao's works have increased from two last year to seven this year. The output of thin letterpress paper in the first quarter of this year has increased by 40% compared to the same period last year.

	The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Paper Mill have also resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's instructions on "frugality for revolution," not wasting a single penny of the state's money, and not asking the state for subsidies. In 1967, just for Mao cloth, raw materials, and fuel, they saved the state more than 400,000 yuan in expenses.

    为宣传伟大的毛泽东思想作出贡献
    北京造纸总厂革命职工试制成功印刷《毛主席语录》袖珍本用的薄凸版纸
    本报讯　北京造纸总厂广大革命职工，坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，把生产仗当作政治仗来打，狠抓革命，猛促生产，不断取得毛主席著作用纸生产的新成就。
    北京造纸总厂广大革命职工，在革命委员会领导下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，深入持久地开展革命大批判，大大提高了阶级斗争觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，大大加深了对伟大领袖毛主席的无限深厚的阶级感情，大大增强了宣传战无不胜的毛泽东思想的责任心。革命职工说，毛泽东思想是我们的命根子，中国赫鲁晓夫反对宣传毛泽东思想，我们就要努力多生产毛主席著作用纸，为宣传毛泽东思想作出贡献。这个厂的前进分厂的革命职工，怀着无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的红心，大搞科学实验，克服重重困难，第一次生产出印刷《毛主席语录》袖珍本用的薄凸版纸。
    前进分厂刚接受试制薄凸版纸的任务时，有的技术“权威”提出一大堆困难，说什么生产这种纸没有进口设备不行，没有外国原料不行。用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命工人听了十分气愤，他们说：过去彭真反革命修正主义集团，伙同厂里的走资派，千方百计地抵制毛主席著作用纸的生产，说什么厂里条件差，不能生产高级用纸，荒谬地提出“设备决定一切”。厂里走资派甚至公开叫嚷“生产薄凸版纸利润低，产量少，没意思”。今天一些迷信洋教条的技术“权威”又出来阻拦我们生产薄凸版纸，这绝对办不到。
    工人们清楚地认识到，生产薄凸版纸，不是一般生产任务，而是一场政治仗，是两条路线的尖锐斗争。他们决心按照毛主席关于自力更生、艰苦奋斗的教导办事，破除迷信，解放思想，依靠集体的智慧和力量，绝对不让技术“权威”牵着鼻子走。工人们说：为了让毛主席他老人家的光辉思想能传遍全世界，我们不吃饭、不睡觉，也要把薄凸版纸试制出来。他们遇到困难，就坐下来反复学习毛主席的教导：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。”生产这种纸，辅助材料用量大。没有溶化辅料的设备，他们因陋就简，用大缸小缸来代替，没有辅料储存设备，就用浆井来代替。革命职工经过夜以继日的奋战，终于冲破洋教条、洋框框的束缚，自力更生地在短期内把薄凸版纸生产出来了。
    继前进分厂薄凸版纸的试制成功，各厂又先后进行试验和改革。造纸一分厂的广大革命职工“敢”字当头，又在圆网纸机上用全部自制漂白草浆生产出薄凸版纸。
    经过不断同阶级敌人作斗争，同无政府主义思潮作斗争，全厂抓革命促生产成绩显著。去年生产的纸张，比一九六六年增加百分之十二点七，毛主席著作用纸成倍增长。目前，毛主席著作用纸的品种，已由去年的两种增加到七种，今年第一季度薄凸版纸的产量就比去年同期增长百分之四十。
    北京造纸总厂广大革命职工，还坚决按照毛主席关于“节约闹革命”的指示办事，不乱花国家一分钱，不伸手向国家要补助。一九六七年，仅毛布、原料、燃料三项，就为国家节省了四十多万元开支。
