Under the guidance of the latest instructions from our great leader Chairman Mao, the revolutionary cadres and broad masses of revolutionary workers in the Hebi coal mining area, an important coal production base in Henan Province, have been intensifying class struggle, carrying out thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, leading production with revolution, and achieving unprecedentedly good results in both revolution and production. All units under the Hebi Mining Bureau, including 16 mines and factories, have now established revolutionary committees. The victories of the revolution have promoted a significant increase in coal production. In May, the entire bureau fully exceeded the state's coal production plan.

The production achievements of the Hebi Mining Bureau were made through intensifying class struggle. After the establishment of revolutionary committees in the bureau and its subordinate mines and factories, they heeded Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle" and led the broad masses of revolutionary workers in an unrelenting attack against the Chinese Khrushchov and his agents in the Hebi mining area. They used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to deepen and broaden the revolutionary criticism. From the mine entrance to the coal yard, from Mao Zedong Thought study classes to workers' dormitories, throughout the tens of miles of the mining area, everywhere is a battlefield for revolutionary criticism. Revolutionary workers listed numerous shocking facts of class struggle, severely criticizing the "class struggle extinction" theory advocated by the Chinese Khrushchov, exposing the evil plots of the Chinese Khrushchov and his agents in the Hebi mining area to restore capitalism under the cover of the "class struggle extinction" theory, and bringing them to light in broad daylight. The revolutionary criticism further promoted the ideological revolutionization of the broad masses of revolutionary workers.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution waged by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes in the condition of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its led broad revolutionary masses and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." In the process of seizing the revolution and promoting production, the broad masses of revolutionary workers in the Hebi mining area seriously studied and implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, closely watched the new trends, new problems, and new characteristics of class struggle, and firmly grasped the initiative in class struggle. The broad masses of revolutionary workers in the Li Xin and Dong Feng mines used the great Mao Zedong Thought to expose the evil plots of the class enemies to sabotage production, sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and attempt to undermine the newly established revolutionary committees, smashing the evil winds of reversal stirred up by the class enemies, and rooting out a handful of diehard capitalist roaders and traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries hidden within the revolutionary ranks, ensuring the implementation of Chairman Mao's great policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production." These two mines exceeded the state's coal production plan for May by 38% and 33% respectively. Currently, the broad masses of revolutionary workers in the Hebi mining area, inspired by the great news of Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin's reception of the representatives attending the coal mining conference on seizing the revolution and promoting production, are advancing victoriously. They turn their boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao into a tremendous driving force for seizing the revolution and promoting production, ensuring a steady increase in coal output, and continuously setting new records for the highest daily coal production in the bureau in recent years.

    狠抓阶级斗争　以革命统帅生产
    鹤壁煤炭生产大幅度增长
    全矿到处摆开革命大批判的战场；革命大批判促进了广大革命职工的思想革命化，五月份全面超额完成国家煤炭生产计划
    新华社郑州十五日电  在伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示指引下，河南省重要煤炭生产基地鹤壁矿区的无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，以革命统帅生产，革命和生产形势空前大好。鹤壁矿务局以及所属十六个厂、矿等单位，现在全部成立了革命委员会。革命的节节胜利，促进了煤炭生产大幅度增长。五月份，全局全面超额完成了国家煤炭生产计划。
    鹤壁矿务局的生产成就，是在狠抓阶级斗争中取得的。矿务局和所属厂、矿革命委员会成立以后，牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，率领广大革命职工，不停顿地向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在鹤壁矿区的代理人发起猛烈进攻。他们用战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，把革命的大批判开展得更加深入，更加广泛。从井口到煤场，从毛泽东思想学习班到职工宿舍，数十里矿区，处处是革命大批判的战场。革命职工们列举大量惊心动魄的阶级斗争事实，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，把中国赫鲁晓夫及其在鹤壁矿区的代理人在“阶级斗争熄灭”论的掩盖下妄图复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋，暴露在光天化日之下。革命的大批判，进一步促进了广大革命职工的思想革命化。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”在抓革命、促生产中，鹤壁矿区的广大革命职工，认真学习和落实毛主席的最新指示，密切注视阶级斗争的新动向，新问题，新特点，牢牢掌握阶级斗争的主动权。立新和东风两个矿的广大革命职工用伟大的毛泽东思想识破了阶级敌人破坏生产，破坏无产阶级文化大革命，妄图动摇新生的革命委员会的罪恶阴谋，粉碎了阶级敌人刮起的翻案妖风，揪出了一小撮顽固不化的走资派和隐藏在革命队伍内部的叛徒、特务和反革命分子，保证了毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的贯彻执行。这两个矿分别超额百分之三十八和百分之三十三完成了五月份国家煤炭生产计划。目前，鹤壁矿区的广大革命职工，正在伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席接见出席煤矿抓革命、促生产会议代表的特大喜讯鼓舞下，乘胜前进。他们把对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱和无限忠诚，化为抓革命、促生产的巨大动力，促使煤炭产量稳定上升，连续刷新了近几年来全局煤炭日产量最高纪录。
