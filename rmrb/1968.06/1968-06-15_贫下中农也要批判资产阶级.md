	The Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Must Also Criticize the Bourgeoisie
	Shanghai City, Chuansha County, Gulu Commune, Weed Eradication Combat Group

	“Awaken thousands and millions of workers and peasants,
	Unite in heart and mind to fight,
	The red flag waves under Mount Buzhou.”

	Our Weed Eradication Combat Group is composed of poor and lower-middle peasant community members and revolutionary cadres from the countryside. Since its establishment nearly a year ago, we have followed the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions that "communal farmers should focus on agriculture... and also criticize the bourgeoisie." Using our own experiences and insights as poor and lower-middle peasants, we have written several revolutionary critical articles, launching a fierce attack on the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary line.

	“Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman, revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought.” In our literary criticism, we also use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a powerful weapon.

	The first battle our Weed Eradication Combat Group launched after its establishment was to criticize the modern revisionist literary patriarch of the Soviet Union, Sholokhov's poisonous weed, “The Fate of a Man.” At that time, some comrades thought that we “small people” had “shallow literary knowledge” and “poor artistic theory,” fearing that we couldn't criticize well. We brought this question to study Chairman Mao's works. In “Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art,” Chairman Mao pointed out: “Literary criticism has two standards, one is the political standard, and the other is the artistic standard. ... But in any class society, any class always places the political standard first and the artistic standard second.” We have Chairman Mao's brilliant literary thoughts, which are the highest level of Marxism-Leninism literary theory today. We represent the revolutionary proletariat, while domestic and foreign counter-revolutionary revisionists represent the decaying bourgeoisie. We have already politically and theoretically defeated them, and there is no question of “shallow literary knowledge” or “poor artistic theory.” Using Mao Zedong Thought as a sharp weapon, we can launch an attack on those counter-revolutionary revisionist giants and be invincible. We repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's “On the Question of 'Dream of the Red Chamber' Research,” and “Minutes of the Symposium on Army Literary Work Convened by Comrade Lin Biao and Comrade Jiang Qing,” which further inspired the fighting spirit of these revolutionary “small people.”

	“Chairman Mao waves his hand, and I advance.” Through study, everyone's heart is red, eyes are bright, and the direction is clear, writing the first critical article “Raising Hoes and Hammers to Beat Sholokhov.” It was published in newspapers.

	To truly master Mao Zedong Thought, according to Comrade Lin Biao's instruction to “study Chairman Mao's many basic viewpoints repeatedly, memorize some aphorisms, study repeatedly, and use repeatedly,” our group took the “Three Constantly Read Articles” as a motto to study, often, memorize, use, and compare, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide our pens. Every time we write a critical article, we first study Chairman Mao's works, then use our experiences as poor and lower-middle peasants to present facts and reason to refute. For example, when writing the article “Resolutely Cut Off the Black Hand of the Chinese Khrushchev's Revisionist Party-Building Line Extending into Literature—Critique of the Black Novel ‘Returning Home’ and Its Portrayal of Party Members,” we first studied Chairman Mao's instructions on party building, then severely criticized the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist party-building line.

	Chairman Mao taught us: “Revolutionary war is the war of the masses; only by mobilizing the masses can we wage war, and only by relying on the masses can we wage war.” In our literary criticism, we do not close the door and do it alone, but start from the actual class struggle and two-line struggle between the two classes in the countryside, focusing our main efforts on mobilizing more masses and cadres, especially illiterate poor and lower-middle peasant community members, to join the revolutionary criticism. In addition to holding various criticism meetings, we also adopted the form of storytelling that the masses like to hear, to carry out literary criticism. Not only did we write and perform ourselves, but we also mobilized the masses to write and perform.

	On November 21 last year, our commune screened the poisonous film “Two Families.” That evening, we invited several old poor peasants and old cadres to hold a symposium to criticize it. Later, with the support of the commune revolutionary committee, in conjunction with the specific situation of the two-class, two-line, and two-road struggles in our commune, we held a “Highly Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought, Thoroughly Criticize the Reactionary Film ‘Two Families’” meeting. We not only criticized the poisonous weed of the reactionary film “Two Families” but also severely criticized the “exploitation is meritorious,” “four freedoms,” and “three selfs and one package” revisionist fallacies spread by Chinese Khrushchev and his henchmen. The comrades who attended the meeting returned to their production brigades and teams and further organized the masses to study the important article “The Struggle Between the Two Lines in China's Countryside” by the editorial departments of the two newspapers and one journal, and in conjunction with the actual situation of their own teams, held small-scale criticism meetings. The responsible comrades of the commune revolutionary committee said: Such literary criticism meetings are in line with the situation, widely mobilize the masses, have new content and forms, and are more educational. We have realized from practice that only in this way can we truly achieve “weeding out poisonous weeds with collective wisdom, digging up revisionist roots, and fighting bravely,” enabling the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to further master the weapon of literary criticism.

	In the past year, under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary thought and the guidance of the “Minutes,” we have written a total of 22 articles, including 15 articles criticizing the literary black line, 5 created revolutionary stories, and 2 positive commentaries. We have taken the first step in defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line. We are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong's literary thought, advance victoriously, and carry out the literary criticism deeply and persistently.

    贫下中农也要批判资产阶级
    上海市川沙县顾路公社　铲毒草战斗组
    “唤起工农千百万，同心干，不周山下红旗乱。”
    我们这个铲毒草战斗组是由贫下中农社员和农村革命干部组成的。建立近一年来，我们遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于“公社农民以农为主……也要批判资产阶级”的教导，用我们贫下中农的亲身经历和体会，写了一些革命大批判的文章，向反革命修正主义文艺黑线展开了猛烈进攻。
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”我们搞文艺批判，同样以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为强大武器。
    我们铲毒草战斗组建立后的第一个战役就是批判苏联现代修正主义文艺鼻祖肖洛霍夫的大毒草《一个人的遭遇》。当时，有的同志觉得我们这些“小人物”的“文学知识浅”、“文艺理论差”，怕批不好。我们带着这个问题，请教毛主席著作。毛主席在《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》中指出：“文艺批评有两个标准，一个是政治标准，一个是艺术标准。……但是任何阶级社会中的任何阶级，总是以政治标准放在第一位，以艺术标准放在第二位的。”我们有毛主席光辉的文艺思想，这就是当代最高水平的马列主义文艺理论。我们代表的是革命的无产阶级，国内外的反革命修正主义分子代表的是腐朽没落的资产阶级，我们在政治上，在理论上，早就压倒了他们，这里根本不存在什么“文学知识浅”、“文艺理论差”的问题。我们用毛泽东思想这一锐利武器，向那些反革命修正主义的庞然大物发动进攻，就能够所向披靡。我们反复学习了毛主席《关于红楼梦研究问题的信》，学习了《林彪同志委托江青同志召开的部队文艺工作座谈会纪要》，这些光辉的文献进一步鼓舞了我们这些革命“小人物”的斗志。
    “毛主席挥手我前进。”通过学习，大家心红眼亮方向明，写出了第一篇批判文章《举起锄头铁鎝痛打肖洛霍夫》，在报刊上公开发表了。
    为了把毛泽东思想真正学到手，根据林彪同志“要反复学习毛主席的许多基本观点，有些警句最好要背熟，反复学习，反复运用”的指示，我们小组把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学，经常学，经常背，经常用，经常对照，用毛泽东思想统帅我们手中的笔杆子。我们每写一篇批判文章都是先学习毛主席著作，然后用我们贫下中农的经历，摆事实讲道理进行批驳。如在写《坚决斩断中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义建党路线伸向文艺中的黑手——评黑小说〈归家〉中的党员形象》一文时，我们先学习毛主席论党的建设的有关指示，然后狠批中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义建党路线。
    毛主席教导我们：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”我们搞文艺批判，不是关起门来搞，而是从农村两个阶级、两条道路斗争的实际出发，把主要力量放在发动更多的群众、干部，特别是发动不识字的贫下中农社员一起投入革命的大批判。除了开各种批判会之外，我们还采用了群众喜闻乐见的演讲革命故事的形式，进行文艺批判。不但我们自己编，自己讲，还发动广大群众编，发动广大群众讲。
    去年十一月二十一日，我们公社放映了毒草影片《两家人》，当天晚上我们邀集了几位老贫农和老干部一起开座谈会进行批判。后来在公社革命委员会的支持下，结合我们公社两个阶级、两条路线、两条道路斗争的具体情况，又召开了一个“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底批判反动影片《两家人》大会”。既批判了反动影片《两家人》这株大毒草，又狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其爪牙所散布的“剥削有功”、“四大自由”、“三自一包”等修正主义谬论。到会同志，回到生产大队、生产队以后，进一步组织广大社员学习了中央两报一刊编辑部的重要文章《中国农村两条道路的斗争》，联系本队实际情况，开了小型批判会。公社革命委员会的负责同志说：这样的文艺批判大会，形势跟得紧，群众发动广，内容形式新，教育比较深。我们从实践中体会到只有这样，才能真正做到“铲毒草群策群力，挖修根越战越勇”，使广大贫下中农进一步掌握文艺批评的武器。
    近一年来，我们在毛主席革命文艺思想的光辉照耀下，在《纪要》的指引下，一共写出了二十二篇文章，其中批判文艺黑线的文章十五篇，创作的革命故事有五个，正面的评论文章两篇，在保卫毛主席革命文艺路线的战斗里程上迈出了第一步。我们决心更高地举起毛泽东文艺思想的伟大红旗，乘胜前进，将文艺大批判深入持久地开展下去。
