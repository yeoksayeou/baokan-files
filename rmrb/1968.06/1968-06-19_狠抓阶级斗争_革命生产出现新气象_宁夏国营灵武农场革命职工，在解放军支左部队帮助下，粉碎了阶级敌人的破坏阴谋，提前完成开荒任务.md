Ningxia State-owned Lingwu Farm's revolutionary workers, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support troops, have smashed the class enemies' sabotage plots and completed the land reclamation task ahead of schedule.

XINHUA NEWS AGENCY YINCHUAN, June 18 - The revolutionary workers of Ningxia State-owned Lingwu Farm, following the strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, with the strong support of the stationed leftist support troops of the People's Liberation Army, have smashed the plots and tricks of a handful of class enemies who aimed to sabotage the revolution and production and overthrow the newly established revolutionary committee. They have achieved double victories in revolution and production. Now, revolutionary committees or revolutionary leading groups have been established in all stations and teams across the farm, and everywhere is filled with a new atmosphere of intensifying the revolution and vigorously promoting production.

Currently, the farm's task of reclaiming over 4,000 mu of land this year has been completed ahead of schedule. Some stations and teams have even created a new record for the fastest summer sowing since the farm's establishment. Some mechanized teams completed all tasks of their station ahead of schedule and then actively helped nearby communes' production teams with summer sowing, receiving enthusiastic welcome from the commune members.

After the revolutionary committee of Lingwu Farm was born in March this year amidst the stormy class struggle, a handful of class enemies were not willing to accept their defeat. These elements spread rumors and shot dark arrows, attempting to sabotage the revolution and production and overthrow the newly established revolutionary committee.

The serious facts of class struggle have once again educated the revolutionary fighters of the proletariat and comrades of various levels of revolutionary committees: the revolution cannot stop for a moment, and the struggle must not be relaxed. They followed Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forgetting class struggle" and, with the help of the stationed leftist support troops, immediately held meetings to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and listen to the opinions of the revolutionary faction of the proletariat. The more the meeting went on, the clearer the direction became, and the more the fighting spirit was aroused. The comrades of the revolutionary committee decided to jump out of the circle of trivial matters, go deep into the grassroots, and mobilize and support the revolutionary faction of the proletariat and revolutionary masses to launch a fierce attack on the class enemies.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its led revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." The proletarian revolutionary fighters of this farm have seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and, under the leadership of the farm's revolutionary committee, launched a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies. They analyzed the situation of class struggle within the farm, clarified the main direction of the struggle, focused on the prominent issues of various stations and teams, thoroughly exposed the cover of class struggle, and dragged out one by one the class enemies who were hiding in dark corners and stirring up trouble. They smashed the rightist reversal wind of the class enemies, consolidated the newly established revolutionary committee, and ensured the smooth progress of the revolution and production.

While launching a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies, the revolutionary workers of the entire farm have thoroughly criticized the revisionist goods such as "material incentives" and "work points as the commander" promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents. This has further raised the awareness of class struggle and line struggle, greatly arousing the enthusiasm for revolution and production. Currently, the revolutionary workers of the entire farm are advancing victoriously, determined to take Comrade Deng Zhihui, who is loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, as an example, to further launch a new high tide of the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong Thought, to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, to intensify class struggle, and to achieve greater victories in revolution and production.

    狠抓阶级斗争　革命生产出现新气象
    宁夏国营灵武农场革命职工，在解放军支左部队帮助下，粉碎了阶级敌人的破坏阴谋，提前完成开荒任务
    新华社银川十八日电  宁夏国营灵武农场广大革命职工紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，在驻场解放军支左部队大力帮助下，粉碎了一小撮阶级敌人破坏抓革命促生产，妄图搞垮新生的革命委员会的阴谋诡计，夺得了革命和生产的双胜利。现在，全场各站、各队的革命委员会或革命领导小组已经全部建立起来，到处呈现着热气腾腾的狠抓革命、猛促生产的新气象。
    目前，这个农场今年开荒四千多亩的艰巨任务已经提前完成，有些站、队还创造了建场以来夏播进度最快的新纪录。有的机耕队提前完成了本站的各项任务后，还主动帮助附近公社的一些生产队突击夏播，受到了社员的热烈欢迎。
    灵武农场革命委员会今年三月在阶级斗争的急风暴雨中诞生之后，一小撮阶级敌人并不甘心于他们的失败。这些家伙造谣言，放暗箭，妄想破坏抓革命、促生产，颠覆新生的革命委员会。
    阶级斗争的严重事实再一次教育了无产阶级革命派战士和各级革委会的同志：革命一刻不能停止，斗争丝毫不能松懈。他们遵照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，在驻场支左部队帮助下，立即召开会议，学习毛主席最新指示，听取无产阶级革命派的意见。会议越开方向越明确，越谈斗志越昂扬。革委会的同志决心从事务圈子里跳出来，分头深入基层，发动和支持无产阶级革命派和革命群众向阶级敌人发起猛烈进攻。
    毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”这个场的无产阶级革命派战士认真学习了毛主席的这一最新指示，在场革委会的带领下，向一小撮阶级敌人展开了猛烈的进攻。他们分析了场内阶级斗争的情况，明确了斗争的主攻方向，抓住各站、队的突出问题，大揭阶级斗争的盖子，把一小撮藏在阴暗角落里兴风作浪的阶级敌人一个个揪了出来，粉碎了阶级敌人的右倾翻案妖风，巩固了新生的革命委员会，保证了抓革命促生产的顺利进行。
    在向一小撮阶级敌人猛烈进攻的同时，这个场的广大革命职工狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所推行的“物质刺激”、“工分挂帅”等修正主义黑货，从而进一步提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟，极大地激发了革命和生产的积极性。目前，全场广大革命职工正在乘胜前进，决心以“无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部”门合同志为榜样，进一步掀起活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动的新高潮，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓阶级斗争，夺取革命和生产的更大胜利。
