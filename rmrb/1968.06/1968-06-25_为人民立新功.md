	Standing New Merits for the People

	As a representative of the revolutionary masses, after participating in the "three-in-one combination" revolutionary committee, how do we maintain a vigorous revolutionary spirit, and energetically grasp the revolution, promote production, and promote work, standing new merits for the people? This is a serious question before me.

	I am the daughter of a poor peasant. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses selected us "little people" to take up leadership positions and participate in the county revolutionary committee. The environment and status have changed so much, the burden on my shoulders is so heavy, the revolutionary situation is developing rapidly, the situation is constantly changing, and there are countless tasks to handle every day. I felt that I could not keep up with the new situation, and for a time, I had a sense of difficulty. Later, I developed a sense of dependence. I thought, since there are revolutionary cadres, they have more experience and are familiar with the situation, I'll just be a "helper" to avoid making mistakes. Therefore, the original spirit of daring to think, speak, do, and revolutionize gradually decreased, and the vigorous spirit gradually weakened. In the Mao Zedong Thought study class, revolutionary cadres used their own mistakes to enlighten me, and the PLA comrades helped me individually. I studied Chairman Mao's teachings regarding these problems, and the more I studied, the more I felt that I was letting Chairman Mao down and failing the trust of the proletarian revolutionary faction and the revolutionary masses. I made a firm decision to put down my burdens, start the machine, stand new merits for the people, and forever follow Chairman Mao in making the revolution.

	Every time you engage in a struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism, your loyalty to Chairman Mao and the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao increases, and your consciousness of standing merits for the people is elevated. Once, during a standing committee meeting discussing the leadership of several schools, I felt that there was a tendency to not fully consider the new forces. Should I speak up or not? I hesitated. At this moment, I remembered Chairman Mao's teaching: "Make the predecessors not separate from the masses, and let the young people get tempered." I decisively put forward my views, and comrades enthusiastically supported me. I felt that the representative of the revolutionary masses must always follow Chairman Mao's teachings, maintain the revolutionary spirit of daring to think, speak, and do, so as to add youthful vitality and vigor to the new revolutionary committee.

	To stand new merits for the people, one must never be separated from the masses. After coming to the revolutionary committee, someone said, "You are a standing committee member, you should have a certain demeanor." What demeanor?! I am a new soldier in the revolutionary struggle, coming from the common people, and should maintain the original character of the working people, living and fighting with comrades. Once, when working in a production team of the Denglou People's Commune, the commune members sent manure and I loaded the car, the commune members engaged in revolutionary criticism and I participated. They all called me "Little Liu," and I felt very close. My status has changed, but my thought of serving the people cannot change, and I must not have any special privileges. Chairman Mao said: "It is not difficult for a person to do a good deed, but it is difficult to do good deeds all his life, not to do bad deeds, and to be beneficial to the broad masses of the people all the time..." I am still young, and the revolutionary road is still long. Only by more diligently studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, constantly changing my worldview, can I stand new merits for the people in the revolutionary struggle.

### 为人民立新功

    为人民立新功
    黑龙江省望奎县革命委员会常委
    望奎县红旗人民公社二西大队社员  刘长玉
    革命群众的代表，参加“三结合”的革命委员会以后，如何保持旺盛的革命斗志，朝气蓬勃地抓革命，促生产，促工作，为人民立新功？这是摆在我面前的一个严肃问题。
    我是贫农的女儿。在无产阶级文化大革命中，革命群众把我们这些“小人物”推选到领导岗位，参加了县革命委员会。环境、地位变化这么大，肩上挑的担子这么重，革命形势发展迅速，情况在不断变化，每天要抓的工作千头万绪，自己感到跟不上发展的新形势，一度产生畏难情绪，后来又变成依赖思想。心想，反正有革命的领导干部，人家经验多，情况熟，我就当个“扒拉角”吧，免得出差错。因此，原来那种敢想、敢说、敢干、敢闯、敢革命的精神逐渐地减少了，旺盛的斗志逐渐地减弱了。在毛泽东思想学习班里，革命的领导干部用自己犯错误的教训开导我，解放军同志个别地帮助我。我针对这些问题学习毛主席的教导，越学越觉得自己对不起毛主席，有负于无产阶级革命派和革命群众的委托。我痛下决心，坚决放下包袱，开动机器，为人民立新功，永远紧跟毛主席闹革命。
    进行一次斗私批修，对毛主席和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线就增加一分忠诚，为人民立功劳的思想觉悟就提高一步。有一次，我们常委会议讨论几所学校的领导班子，我觉得讨论中有对新生力量考虑不够的倾向，提出来还是不提出来？我犹豫不定。这时，我想起了毛主席的教导：“使前辈人不脱离群众，使青年人得到锻炼。”我果断地提出了自己的看法，同志们热情地支持我。我体会到革命群众代表要永远按照毛主席的教导，保持敢想、敢说、敢干的革命精神，这样才能给新生的革命委员会增添青春活力和生气。
    要不断为人民立新功，还必须一刻也不脱离群众。我到革委会来以后，有人说“你是常委了，应该有个样子。”什么样子？！我是革命斗争中的一个新兵，来自老百姓，就应该保持工农劳动群众的本色，和战友们生活在一起，战斗在一起。一次到灯塔人民公社的生产队工作，社员送粪我装车，社员搞革命大批判我参加。他们都叫我“小刘”，我感到非常亲切。自己地位变了，为人民服务的思想不能变，说啥也不能有半点特殊。毛主席说：“一个人做点好事并不难，难的是一辈子做好事，不做坏事，一贯的有益于广大群众，……”我的年纪还很轻，革命的道路还很长，只有更刻苦地活学活用毛泽东思想，不断地改造自己的世界观，才能在革命斗争中不断为人民立新功。
