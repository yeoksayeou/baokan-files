The revolutionary committee of Shijiazhuang Steel Plant, with the assistance of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the plant, has led revolutionary workers to focus on class struggle. They have conducted a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism campaign, which has effectively promoted the rapid development of production. Building on the achievement of completing last year's annual production plan fifteen days ahead of schedule, this plant has once again completed this year's first half of the state's production plan ahead of schedule. The quality of both steel and steel products has also been improved compared to before.

    石家庄钢铁厂完成上半年生产计划
    石家庄市钢铁厂革命委员会在驻厂人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，率领革命职工狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，有力地推动了生产的大发展。这个厂在去年提前十五天完成全年生产计划的基础上，今年又提前完成了上半年的国家生产计划，钢和钢材的质量都比以前提高。
