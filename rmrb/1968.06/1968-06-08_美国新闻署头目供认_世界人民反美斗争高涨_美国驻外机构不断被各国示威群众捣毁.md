	U.S. News Agency Chief Admits Global Anti-American Struggle Intensifying
	U.S. Overseas Institutions Repeatedly Destroyed by Protesting Crowds

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report, Washington: The head of the U.S. official propaganda agency, the United States Information Agency (USIA), Marcos, recently admitted that as the anti-American struggle intensifies worldwide, incidents of U.S. overseas institutions being destroyed by local protesters have sharply increased.

	Marcos provided figures in his recent testimony to the U.S. Congress, indicating that from early March 1967 to the end of February 1968, the number of USIA cultural infiltration institutions abroad, such as "American libraries" and "American cultural centers," destroyed by local protesters increased from 12 to 56. The total value of the destroyed property increased by more than 40 times.

	The Associated Press reported this news with lament, stating that while it is "difficult" to specifically estimate the extent of the growth of anti-American sentiment in various countries, "these figures seem to speak for themselves."

	This news agency also pointed out with unease that this anti-American sentiment is continuing to grow.

	Just a few days ago, a "library" opened by the USIA in the Belgian capital, Brussels, was hit by a time bomb.

	The person who placed the time bomb left a note indicating that the action was taken in protest of Belgium "gradually becoming a colony of the United States."

    美国新闻署头目供认
    世界人民反美斗争高涨
    美国驻外机构不断被各国示威群众捣毁
    据新华社讯　华盛顿消息：美国官方宣传机构美国新闻署头目马科斯最近承认，随着世界范围的反美斗争的高涨，美国驻外机构遭到当地示威群众捣毁的事件急剧增加。
    马科斯在最近向美国国会作证时提供的数字表明，在从一九六七年三月初到一九六八年二月底的一年内，仅美国新闻署在国外的各种文化侵略机构，如美国“图书馆”、美国“文化中心”等，被当地示威群众捣毁的，就从前一年的十二处增加到五十六处，被捣毁的财物总值则增加了四十多倍。
    美国合众国际社在报道这一消息时哀叹，虽然“难于”具体估计各国人民反美情绪增长的程度，“但是这些数字似乎是不言自明的”。
    这家通讯社还不安地指出，这种反美情绪还正在继续增长。
    就在前几天，美国新闻署在比利时首都布鲁塞尔开设的一所“图书馆”又挨了定时炸弹。
    放置定时炸弹的人在留下的一张字条上表明，他是因为抗议比利时“正在日益沦为美国的殖民地”而采取这一行动的。
