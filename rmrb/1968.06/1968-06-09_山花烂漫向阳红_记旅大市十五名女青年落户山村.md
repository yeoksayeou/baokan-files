In the midst of the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, on the ancestral land of the Liaodong Peninsula in Northeast China, a moving story of fifteen young women settling in a mountain village is widely praised. This story began two years ago in the spring...

To the Most Difficult Places

In the midst of the blooming flowers of May, the drums and gongs of the Linchang Brigade in the Bayli Commune of Jin County, Liaoning Province, were resounding. The poor and lower-middle peasants, holding red copies of Chairman Mao's Quotations, welcomed fifteen young women. They were the youth from the Zhongshan District of Luda City who had come to settle in the countryside.

These young women's decision to go to the countryside was not smooth sailing. They had fought their way out from under the bourgeois reactionary line.

At that time, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, had just begun. These middle school graduates, with their loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, and their ambition to build a socialist motherland, were determined to go to the mountains and countryside, to follow the path of integrating with workers and peasants. However, some people in the neighborhood who were implementing the bourgeois reactionary line said to them: "If you go to the countryside, as long as you work hard for three to five years, learn farming skills, and obtain peasant qualifications, you can quickly join the Party or the Youth League. Plus, you have education, you will definitely become a cadre. Soon, you can return to the city."

At that time, many people felt something was wrong with these words, but they did not recognize their reactionary essence. These words also catered to the backward psychology of some individuals.

Should they go to the relatively prosperous Fruit Tree Team or to the poor mountain valley of the Linchang Brigade? A fierce debate erupted over the "selection" issue.

Some people said: "After all, we are not going to settle in the countryside permanently. We just need to work hard for a few years and then return to the city. These few years, we might as well stay in the Fruit Tree Team. There is more income and better conditions there."

Some people disagreed. They said: "The countryside needs us, and we need the countryside even more. Although the Linchang Brigade is a poor mountain valley, the more difficult the environment, the more it can temper and transform people. We should go to the poor team!"

Which opinion was correct? They sat together and opened Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao taught: "What is work? Work is struggle. Where there are difficulties and problems, we need to go and solve them. We go to work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go, this is what a good comrade does." Chairman Mao's words opened the doors to their hearts. They unanimously agreed: Work is struggle, we should go to the most difficult places. Going to the mountains and countryside is not to "gold-plate" oneself or to seek an official position, but to till the land for the revolution for a lifetime, to build a new socialist countryside, and to temper ourselves into successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Thus, the fifteen young women, carrying the golden book of Chairman Mao's Quotations, came to the remote mountain village and settled in the Fourth Production Team of the Linchang Brigade. The young women looked around and indeed saw rolling hills, barren soil, and stones underfoot—a genuine poor mountain valley. However, the difficulties did not intimidate them. They said boldly: "Chairman Mao teaches us that when one is poor, one thinks of change, to work and to make a revolution. We will grow strong under the radiance of the red sun, determined to be the masters of the mountain valley, and not just visitors."

United Closely with the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants

In this village of nineteen households, a twentieth household has been added. The poor and lower-middle peasants joyfully said: "These children are sent by Chairman Mao, we must cultivate these young people well, so that Chairman Mao can be at ease."

One dawn, it was raining lightly. Poor peasant Grandma San heard that a young woman was sick and got up early to brave the rain and cook medicine for the sick person. The young women were very grateful. Grandma San said: "Chairman Mao told me to do this. Norman Bethune was a foreigner who risked his life to treat our wounded soldiers. I am a Chinese, what's a little rain?" Grandma San spoke little, but she gave the young women a vivid lesson in Mao Zedong Thought. Among the fifteen young women, Ke Qiaoyun, who served as the team's volunteer medical worker, understood this the most deeply. She reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings: "Comrade Norman Bethune's spirit of selflessness, manifested in his extreme responsibility to his work and his extreme enthusiasm for his comrades and the people." She decided to learn from Comrade Norman Bethune and the poor and lower-middle peasants, to serve the people for a lifetime.

One winter night, the north wind howled, and the snow fell heavily. At around three in the morning, community member Lin Xi rushed to Ke Qiaoyun's house to ask her to see his sick child. Little Ke saw the wind and snow outside the window and hesitated. At that moment, she suddenly remembered Norman Bethune treating the wounded in the midst of gunfire and Grandma San braving the rain to cook medicine. She immediately got out of bed, picked up her medical bag, and went out.

Upon entering Lin Xi's house, she saw the whole family gathered around the three-year-old child who was rolling on the kang in pain. Little Ke diagnosed the child with ascariasis and immediately gave the child an injection. Only after the child slowly fell asleep did she let out a sigh of relief. The child's grandfather was moved and said: "You young people coming to our village are truly 'urgent'..." Little Ke said: "This is what Chairman Mao told me to do."

The poor and lower-middle peasants listen to Chairman Mao's words the most; they learn from and apply Chairman Mao's works. The young women said: Learning from the poor and lower-middle peasants, we must first learn this. There was such an incident: Yang Shuguang learned to plow the fields. She thought that since the land had ridges and the plow had a share, she just needed to follow the furrow and it would be fine. However, the cow did not listen to her commands, and the plow handle did not go straight. Little Yang was so frustrated that she wanted to throw away the whip and quit. The old team leader who taught her to plow said to her: "A crooked ridge does not produce a crooked grain, first time is difficult, second time is easy, go ahead!" The old team leader saw that Little Yang did not respond and knew that she had not solved the ideological problem. After thinking for a moment, he asked her: "What was the passage you learned from me yesterday?" Little Yang glanced at the team leader and thought, "He is in such a hurry, why are you asking about the passage?" She casually said: "Determine to struggle, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." She recited it like a string of bullets. The team leader saw her like this and laughed. Little Yang was puzzled: "Is that wrong?" The team leader said: "It's right. These are Chairman Mao's words, but just knowing them is not enough, you have to follow them." This made Little Yang's face turn red. She looked at the cow, then at the land, and shouted "Giddy up!" She raised the whip and started plowing again.

The young women followed Chairman Mao's teachings, humbly learning from the poor and lower-middle peasants, cultivating the thoughts and feelings of the working people. Once, Yang Shuguang was assigned to collect manure in the fields. This really troubled Little Yang. She was nervous: In the city, seeing a manure cart made her cover her nose and run away quickly, now she has to collect manure, how dirty! At this time, a community member saw Little Yang's hesitant appearance and deliberately asked her: "Little Yang, do you mind the dirt?" Little Yang thought, "Manure is dirty," but she said, "I don't mind the dirt." The community member said: "If you don't mind the dirt, that's good." After saying this, he picked up a handful of manure and said with a smile: "Good manure, crops are like flowers, relying on manure to flourish." This made Little Yang think deeply: Why don't the poor and lower-middle peasants mind the dirt of manure? Chairman Mao said: "The cleanest are the workers and peasants, even though their hands are black and their feet have cow dung, they are still cleaner than the bourgeoisie and petty-bourgeois intellectuals." Little Yang thought of Chairman Mao's teachings and suddenly understood: It's not the manure that's dirty, it's my bourgeois thoughts that are dirty!

The practice of revolutionary life made the young women deeply feel that the poor and lower-middle peasants are our best teachers, and Mao Zedong Thought has closely united us with the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Return to the Countryside, Make a Revolution on the Spot

The torrential flow of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution surged forward. In this village of rolling hills, the first revolutionary mass organization—"Red Guards of Mao Zedong Thought"—was born. The fifteen revolutionary young people, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, launched an attack on a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party.

The capitalist roaders within the Party, in their death throes, stirred up a counter-revolutionary wind of economism, inciting the down-to-the-countryside youth to leave their production posts and rush to the cities. This wind also blew into the Linchang Brigade.

Last January, a so-called "rebel organization" of down-to-the-countryside youth from Dalian expanded its influence into the countryside. The young women, with their loyalty to the Party and Chairman Mao, joined this organization. Soon, they received a notice from the "headquarters" to go to Dalian for a meeting. They raised the banner of revolutionary rebellion, carrying Chairman Mao's quotation boards, and walked a hundred miles to Dalian. Upon arrival, they saw that the "headquarters" was set up in a first-class hotel in Dalian. Immediately, they had a series of questions: Why is the "headquarters" so extravagant? Why should the down-to-the-countryside youth leave the countryside and stay here to "make a revolution"? The more they looked, the less it seemed right, the more they thought, the more it seemed wrong. The meeting began, and someone shouted on the stage: "The down-to-the-countryside youth should 'return to the city to make a revolution'." They heard these words and understood everything. They opened their copies of Chairman Mao's Quotations, and Chairman Mao said: "...Those who are willing and actually integrate with the workers and peasants are revolutionary; otherwise, they are not revolutionary or are counter-revolutionary. He is revolutionary today because he integrates himself with the workers and peasants today; but if he does not integrate tomorrow or oppresses the people, then he is not revolutionary or is counter-revolutionary." Mao Zedong Thought guided their struggle. They thought and spoke in one mind: "Return to the countryside and make a revolution on the spot!" Thus, they resolutely withdrew from the meeting in the middle and announced their withdrawal from the organization.

The next day, they formed a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team and tried to educate the deceived youth to return to the countryside and make a revolution on the spot. On this day, the neighborhood office was packed with people. Some deceived youth surrounded the neighborhood cadres demanding to transfer their household registration to the city. Someone said: "Sending knowledge youth to the countryside is implementing the bourgeois reactionary line." At this time, the fifteen young women said in unison: "Sending knowledge youth to the countryside is a great call from Chairman Mao, not some bourgeois reactionary line. Liu Shaoqi wants us to work for three to five years and then return, to become officials and lords, this is the bourgeois reactionary line!" Another said: "We want to break out of the countryside and return home." The young women said: "Our home is not in the city, our home is in the countryside!" The young women's resolute answers gave a resounding slap in the face to a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. Their actions received strong support from the broad revolutionary masses, and many deceived youth returned to the countryside one after another to make a revolution on the spot.

The young women returned to the Linchang Brigade like victorious soldiers. The poor and lower-middle peasants heard that the young women had returned and rushed to the village entrance to welcome them. An old poor peasant raised his thumb and said to the young women: "You are truly steadfast!"

Never Forget Class Struggle

The sun rose from the eastern mountains, and the dawn reddened the earth. On this day, it was exactly one year since the young women had come to settle in the mountains.

How should this day be commemorated? Chairman Mao taught: "Never forget class struggle," class struggle "must be talked about year after year, month after month, day after day." Deputy Chairman Lin Biao said: "If you don't understand what class is, don't understand what exploitation is, you don't understand revolution." Team leader Liu Liqiang and her comrades discussed and decided to invite the poor and lower-middle peasants to hold a bitterness-sweetness session together, fiercely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of Liu Shaoqi, and exposing the heinous crimes of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party in restoring capitalism.

The poor and lower-middle peasants understood their thoughts the most. The bitter and resentful Lin Grandma had already prepared the "bitterness meal" for them early in the morning. As soon as the bitter and astringent husk cake was placed on the table, Lin Grandma, with tears in her eyes, said to the young people: "Children, this husk cake was still good in the old society. We must never forget the past bitterness! Liu Shaoqi, this big villain, said that 'exploitation is meritorious,' wanting to lead us back on the old road, to suffer twice, can we agree?" "No!" The room echoed with shouts. "Down with Liu Shaoqi!" "Long live Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!" "Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand years, ten thousand ten thousand years!" The slogans shook the valley.

Then, Lin Grandma, sobbing, recounted her tragic experiences in the old society. When she was very young, she went out to beg for food. Once, she went to the door of a big landlord, but the hateful landlord not only did not give her a single grain of rice but also let out a vicious dog to bite her. Lin Grandma, while speaking, rolled up her trousers to show the young women the scars on her legs. Xu Grandma from the second team, who came to participate in the bitterness-sweetness session, also cried and recounted her past painful experiences: At the age of nine, her family was so poor that it echoed, her father reluctantly sold her to be a child bride. Soon, her elder sister was also sold to someone, and her younger sister, because she was sick and had no money to treat, was tortured to death...

Voice after voice of blood and tears gripped the young women's hearts. They, with tears in their eyes, ate the husk cake and drank the bitter vegetable soup. This was not food, it was clearly the bitter water of the poor in the old society. Deputy team leader Deng Yurong and a few other young women also recalled their own bitter family histories. They, with indignation, denounced Liu Shaoqi's various fallacies of restoring capitalism. They said: "Liu Shaoqi wants us to walk the dark road of capitalism, this is a foolish dream!" They all expressed: Forever follow the revolutionary road of knowledge youth going to the mountains and countryside pointed out by Chairman Mao, take over the class of the proletarian revolutionary cause, and forever defend the socialist mountains and rivers for ten thousand years without changing color.

In the great criticism of the revolution, the young women continuously raised their awareness of class struggle and line struggle. Last deep autumn, something happened on the threshing floor of the production team: The community members were happily harvesting the peanuts, suddenly, a family member of a bad element shouted: "Harvesting peanuts should be piled up separately, whether harvested more or less, the scale should be fair. Calculate the work based on the number, to motivate enthusiasm!" Some community members also echoed, but most of the poor and lower-middle peasants disagreed with this method. A great debate immediately broke out on the threshing floor. The young women acutely felt that this was not a small matter, it was a reflection of the struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines.

That night, the young women, with Chairman Mao's red book, as usual, went door-to-door to the community members' homes to guide the study of Chairman Mao's works. They studied with the community members Chairman Mao's teachings on politics being the commander and the soul, fiercely exposing and criticizing Liu Shaoqi's fallacies of "business first" and "material incentives," as well as the revisionist poison of "three autonomies and one contract." The more they exposed, the more they were shocked. The young women and the poor and lower-middle peasants unanimously agreed that implementing "small contract work" was precisely Liu Shaoqi's black goods, we must not be fooled.

It was late at night, and suddenly it started to snow. The young women and the poor and lower-middle peasants quickly ran to the threshing floor. They saw the mushroom-like piles of peanuts, scattered here and there, and thought, "This is not peanuts, it is clearly a pile of 'selfishness'." They picked up the shovels and gathered them all into the collective's big pile. The next day, the young women, holding high a bright red flag with the words "Fight selfishness, criticize revisionism" shining on it, came to the threshing floor. They saw who consciously harvested peanuts for the revolution, harvested more, harvested quickly, and harvested cleanly, and they planted the red flag in front of them, letting the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought forever fly high.

Mao Zedong Thought Takes Root in the Mind

River after river flows into the sea, sunflower after sunflower faces the sun. The young women's hearts are red, infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao. They take the effort to study Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement Mao Zedong Thought, enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and bravely defend Mao Zedong Thought as their lifelong mission. They not only served as the warehouse keeper, cashier, primary school teacher, volunteer medical worker, volunteer barber, and news reader of the production team, but more importantly, they are all propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought and guides of the Mao Zedong Thought study classes of the production team and community members' families. They are determined to build their mountain village into a red Mao Zedong Thought university.

One day, the young women discovered that the team's livestock keeper, Old Man Lin Xiguang, was angrily packing his luggage to go home. Why was this? The young women were puzzled. Old Man Lin had always loved the collective and was selfless, so why did he suddenly return home and quit? That night, Deputy Team Leader Deng Yurong and a few comrades, holding the red book "Three Constantly Read Articles," went to Old Man Lin's house to talk. Old Man Lin was furious and burst out: "I can't take this!" The young women asked and found out that Old Man Lin had suggested that the team arrange militia to guard the fields, but the team cadres did not pay attention to it, so Old Man Lin was furious. At this time, Little Deng pointed to Old Man Lin's chest and said: "Grandpa, what is written on your quotation board?" Old Man Lin replied: "Serve the People." "How to serve the people?" "Completely and thoroughly!" Old Man Lin's heart suddenly opened, and his anger subsided. The young women immediately followed up: "You made a suggestion, and they did not respond immediately, you got angry, did you think about how packing your luggage and returning home to quit would make people angry?" Old Man Lin could not help but laugh and said to these lovely young people: "I should learn from you!" The young women replied: "Chairman Mao is over seventy years old, for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, he still works day and night, what difficulties can we not overcome? For the sake of defending Chairman Mao, defending Mao Zedong Thought, and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, even if it means climbing the knife mountain and crossing the fire sea, we will happily fight on."

There are many such stories. The poor and lower-middle peasants all praised: These young women came to the countryside and brought Mao Zedong Thought to us.

"The ship sails with the helmsman, the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." The young women, relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have walked through two years of struggle. They deeply felt: "Only when Mao Zedong Thought takes root in the mind can one take root in the countryside." Recently, they, as the down-to-the-countryside knowledge youth militia class, were selected as an advanced collective in the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought by the Shenyang Military Region.

The flowing water sings, and the mountains dance. The red sun illuminates the land of the mountain village and reddens the hearts of the young women. The young people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are welcoming the brilliant sunrise, riding the surging tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and growing rapidly in the fiery class struggle.

The fifteen young women from Luda City, after settling in the Linchang Brigade of Bayli Commune, resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production," and together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, worked hard to produce and vowed to achieve a bumper harvest in agricultural production.

    山花烂漫向阳红
    ——记旅大市十五名女青年落户山村
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，在祖国的辽东半岛，在东北地区，广泛传颂着十五个女青年落户山村的动人故事。这个故事是从两年前的春天开始的……
    到最艰苦的地方去
    正当山花烂漫的红五月。辽宁省金县湾里公社林场大队锣鼓喧天，贫下中农社员手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，迎来了十五个姑娘。她们就是旅大市中山区桂林街道的下乡知识青年。
    这些姑娘下乡落户，并非一帆风顺。她们是从资产阶级反动路线下冲杀出来的。
    那时，毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命已经揭开序幕。她们这些中小学毕业的知识青年，怀着对毛主席、对毛泽东思想的赤胆忠心，和建设社会主义祖国的壮志豪情，决心上山下乡，走和工农相结合的道路。可是街道上某些执行资产阶级反动路线的人却对她们说：“你们到农村去，只要认真地种三、五年地，学会了农活，取得了农民资格，就能很快入党、入团。再加上你们有文化，将来一定能当干部。要不了多久还能回城市。”当时，许多人感到这话不对劲，但没有认识到它的反动实质。这些话也迎合了个别人的落后心理。
    是到比较富裕的果树队去，还是到林场大队的穷山沟去？在“选点”问题上，爆发了一场激烈的争论。
    有的人说：“反正我们下乡也不能长期落户，只要好好干几年，早晚还要回城市，这几年干脆就在果树队呆着算了。那里收入多，条件也好。”
    有些人不同意，她们说：“农村需要我们，我们更需要农村。林场大队虽然是个穷山沟，可是，环境越艰苦越能锻炼人，改造人。我们应该到穷队去！”
    两种意见，到底哪个对？她们坐在一起，翻开了毛主席的著作。毛主席教导说：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”毛主席的话打开了她们心灵的大门。她们一致表示：工作就是斗争，我们应该到最艰苦的地方去。上山下乡，决不是要去“镀镀金”，混个什么官做，而是为革命种一辈子田，为了建设社会主义新农村，把自己锻炼成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    就这样，十五个姑娘带着金光闪闪的毛主席的宝书，来到了偏僻的山村，在林场大队第四生产队落了户。姑娘们下地一看，果然是坡岭起伏，土质瘠薄，石头绊脚，是个道地的穷山沟。然而，困难并没有吓倒她们。她们豪迈地说：“毛主席教导我们，穷则思变，要干，要革命。我们要在红太阳的光辉照耀下茁壮成长，誓做山沟里的主人，决不做山沟里的客人。”
    和贫下中农紧密结合在一块
    在这十九户的山村，现在又增添了第二十户人家。贫下中农兴奋地说：“孩子们是毛主席给送来的，咱们可得好好培养这些年轻人，让毛主席他老人家放心。”
    一天拂晓，天下着蒙蒙细雨。贫农三大娘听说有个姑娘得了病，起早顶着雨来给病人熬药。姑娘们十分感激。三大娘却说：“这是毛主席告诉我这样做的。白求恩是个外国人，豁出性命来给咱中国伤员治疗。我是个中国人，身上淋点雨怕什么。”三大娘话不多，但是给姑娘们上了一堂生动的毛泽东思想课。十五个姑娘中，担任队上义务卫生员的寇巧云，对这一点体会最深。她重温了毛主席的教导：“白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。”她下决心向白求恩同志学习，向贫下中农学习，为人民服务一辈子。
    隆冬的一个夜晚，北风呼啸，大雪纷飞。凌晨三点多钟，社员林希家慌慌张张地来找寇巧云给他孩子看病。小寇看见窗外风雪连天，心里有些踌躇。这时，忽然在她脑海里出现了白求恩在枪林弹雨中为伤员治疗和三大娘顶雨熬药的情景，她即刻翻身起床，背着药箱就出去了。
    一进林希家的屋，就看到全家人正围着在炕上疼得打滚的三岁孩子。小寇一诊断，知道是蛔虫症，就立即给孩子打了一针。直到孩子慢慢地入睡了，她才松了一口气。孩子的爷爷感动地说：“你们青年人来到咱村，真‘用急’了……”小寇说：“这是毛主席告诉我这样做的。”
    贫下中农最听毛主席的话，他们对毛主席的著作学了就用。姑娘们说：学习贫下中农，首先要学这一条。有这样一件事：杨淑桂学习扶犁趟地，她以为地有垄，犁有铧，照沟“出溜”就行了。哪想到，牛不听使唤，犁杖不走正道。小杨急得要哭，想扔鞭子不干了。教她扶犁的老队长对她说：“弯弯垄不打弯弯粮，一回生，两回熟，干吧！”老队长见小杨没表态，知道没解决思想问题。稍想了一下就问她：“你昨天和我学的那段语录是什么啦？”小杨看了队长一眼，心想人家急得怪难受的，你还问语录，就不在意地说：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”背得象连珠炮似的。队长看她这个样子，笑了起来。小杨愣了：“不对吗？”队长说：“对。这是毛主席的话呀，光会背不行，得照办。”这句话可把小杨的脸说红了。她看看牛，瞅瞅地，喊了声“驾”！扬鞭起犁，又耕起来了。
    姑娘们遵照毛主席的教导，虚心地向贫下中农学习，培养劳动人民的思想感情。有一次，杨淑桂被分配到地里抓粪。这下可把小杨难住了。她心里直打鼓：在城里见到大粪车都得捂着鼻子赶快跑，现在叫我抓大粪，这有多脏啊！这时，有个社员看小杨缩手缩脚的样子，故意问她：“小杨，嫌不嫌脏？”小杨心想，粪就是脏，嘴上却说：“不嫌脏。”社员说：“不嫌脏就好。”说完伸手抓起一把粪，笑着说：“好粪哪，庄稼是枝花，要靠粪当家。”一句话引起小杨的深思：贫下中农为什么不嫌粪脏呢？毛主席说过：“最干净的还是工人农民，尽管他们手是黑的，脚上有牛屎，还是比资产阶级和小资产阶级知识分子都干净。”小杨想起毛主席的这一教导，心里豁然开朗了：不是粪脏，是我的资产阶级思想脏呀！
    斗争生活的实践，使姑娘们深深感到：贫下中农是我们最好的老师，毛泽东思想把我们和贫下中农紧密结合在一块。
    杀回农村，就地闹革命
    无产阶级文化大革命的洪流滚滚向前。在这个山峦起伏的村落，诞生了第一个革命群众组织——“捍卫毛泽东思想红色娘子军”。十五个革命小将和贫下中农一起，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，向党内一小撮走资派发起进攻。
    党内走资派垂死挣扎，刮起了一股反革命经济主义妖风，煽动下乡青年离开生产岗位，涌向城市。这股妖风也吹到林场大队。
    去年一月，大连的一个所谓上山下乡知识青年的“造反组织”，深入农村扩充势力。姑娘们怀着忠于党、忠于毛主席的红心，参加了这个组织。不久，她们接到“总部”通知，要到大连去开会。她们高举革命造反大旗，背着毛主席语录板，徒步百里，到了大连。到那一看，“总部”设在大连第一流的大饭店里。顿时引起她们一连串的疑问：“总部”为什么这样阔气？下乡青年为什么离开农村呆在这里“闹革命”？越看越不象样子，越想越不对头。会议开始了，这时有人在会上大喊什么：上山下乡的知识青年要“回城市闹革命”。她们一听这话，心里全明白了，她们打开《毛主席语录》，毛主席说：“……愿意并且实行和工农结合的，是革命的，否则就是不革命的，或者是反革命的。他今天把自己结合于工农群众，他今天是革命的；但是如果他明天不去结合了，或者反过来压迫老百姓，那就是不革命的，或者是反革命的了。”毛泽东思想指挥她们战斗。她们心往一处想，话往一处说：“杀回农村去，就地闹革命！”就这样，她们毅然决然地中途退出会场，宣布退出这个组织。
    第二天，她们便组成毛泽东思想宣传队，争取教育受蒙蔽的青年大杀回马枪。这天，街道办事处里，满满地挤了一屋子人。有些受蒙蔽的青年围着街道干部要求往城市迁户口。只听得有人说：“要知识青年上山下乡，是执行资产阶级反动路线。”这时，十五个姑娘一齐说：“知识青年上山下乡是毛主席发出的伟大号召，决不是什么资产阶级反动路线。中国赫鲁晓夫要我们干三、五年就回来，做官当老爷，这才是资产阶级反动路线！”又有的说：“我们要冲出农村，打回老家去。”姑娘们说：“我们的老家不在城市，我们的老家在农村！”姑娘们铿锵有力的回答，给了党内一小撮走资派一记响亮的耳光。她们的行动受到了广大革命群众的热烈支持，许多受蒙蔽的青年纷纷杀回农村，就地闹革命。
    姑娘们象凯旋的战士一样回到了林场大队。贫下中农听说姑娘们回来了，都争着跑到村头去迎接。老贫农翘起大拇指对姑娘们说：“你们真是过得硬！”
    念念不忘阶级斗争
    太阳从东山上升起，朝霞染红了大地。这一天，是姑娘们进山落户整整一年的日子。
    用什么来纪念这个日子呢？毛主席教导说：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”，阶级斗争“必须年年讲，月月讲，天天讲”。林彪副主席说：“不懂得什么是阶级，不懂得什么是剥削，就不懂得革命。”班长刘黎娟和战友们商量，决定请贫下中农一起开个忆苦思甜会，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，控诉党内一小撮走资派复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。
    贫下中农最了解她们的心思。苦大仇深的林大娘，一早就替她们做好了“忆苦饭”。又苦又涩的糠菜饼子一端到桌子上，林大娘就泪水满面地对青年们说：“孩子，这糠菜饼子在旧社会还算好的呢。咱们千万不能忘记过去的苦啊！中国赫鲁晓夫这个大坏蛋，胡说什么‘剥削有功’，要拉咱们走回头路，吃二遍苦，咱们能答应吗？”“不能！”屋子里一片喊声。“打倒中国赫鲁晓夫！”“毛主席的革命路线胜利万岁！”“毛主席万岁，万万岁！”的口号声，震撼山谷。
    接着，林大娘泣不成声地讲述了她在旧社会的悲惨遭遇。很小的时候，她就出外讨饭了。一次，她走到一户大地主的门口，可恨的地主不仅不给一粒米，还放出恶狗咬人。林大娘一边说，一边卷起裤脚，让姑娘们看腿上的伤疤。从二队赶来参加忆苦会的贫农徐大婶，也哭诉了她过去的痛苦经历：九岁时，家里穷得丁当响，父亲忍痛把她卖出去做了童养媳。不久，她的大妹妹也卖给了人家，她的小妹妹因为有病无钱治，活活地给折磨死了……
    声声血泪，揪住了姑娘们的心。她们含着满眼的泪水，吃着糠菜饼子，喝着苦菜汤。这哪里是菜，明明是旧社会穷人的苦水。副班长邓玉荣和其他几个姑娘也都回忆了自己的苦难家史。她们怀着满腔怒火，痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的种种谬论。她们说：“中国赫鲁晓夫要我们走资本主义的黑路，这是痴心妄想！”她们纷纷表示：永远走毛主席指出的知识青年上山下乡的革命道路，接好无产阶级革命事业的班，永保社会主义的江山千秋万代不变色。
    姑娘们在革命的大批判中，不断提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟。去年深秋，在生产队的打谷场上，发生过这样一件事：社员们正在喜摘丰收的花生，突然，一个坏分子的家属喊道：“摘花生应各放一堆，摘多摘少秤杆子公平。按数计工，能调动积极性！”个别社员也随声附和，但大多数贫下中农不同意这种做法。打谷场上立即展开了一场大辩论。姑娘们敏锐地感到，这不是一件小事，这是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的反映。
    这天晚上，姑娘们带着毛主席的红宝书，象往常一样，挨门逐户到社员家里辅导学习毛主席著作。她们和社员一起学习了毛主席关于政治是统帅，是灵魂的教导，狠揭猛批中国赫鲁晓夫散布的“业务挂帅”、“物质刺激”的谬论，以及“三自一包”的修正主义流毒。不揭不知道，一揭吓一跳。姑娘们和贫下中农一致认为，实行“小包工”，这正是中国赫鲁晓夫的黑货，我们千万不能上当。
    夜深了，天忽然飘起雪花来。姑娘们和贫下中农飞快地跑到打谷场上。他们看到蘑菇堆似的一簇簇花生，东一摊西一摊，心想，这哪是花生，简直是一个个“私”字堆。他们操起木锨，全给撮到集体的大堆里。第二天，姑娘们高举着一面鲜艳的红旗，上面写着“要斗私，批修”五个闪闪发光的字，来到打谷场上。她们看到谁自觉地为革命摘花生，摘的多，摘的快，摘的净，就把红旗插在谁的跟前，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗永远高高飘扬。
    毛泽东思想在头脑中扎根
    条条江河归大海，朵朵葵花向太阳。姑娘们一颗颗红心啊，无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席。她们把努力学习毛泽东思想，坚决贯彻毛泽东思想，热情宣传毛泽东思想，勇敢捍卫毛泽东思想，当作毕生的战斗任务。她们不仅担任了生产队的仓库保管员、现金出纳员、耕读小学教员、义务卫生员、义务理发员、读报员，更重要的是，她们都是毛泽东思想宣传员，都是生产队和社员家庭毛泽东思想学习班的辅导员。她们立志要把自己的山村建设成为红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。
    一天，姑娘们发现队里的饲养员林希贵老大爷，气哼哼地挟着行李卷回家了。这是为什么呢？姑娘们心里纳起闷来。林大爷一向热爱集体，大公无私，怎么突然回家不干了呢？晚上，副班长邓玉荣和几个战友，手捧红宝书“老三篇”到林大爷家去谈心。林大爷气不打一处来，象皮球爆破似的“砰”的一句：“这个气我受不了！”姑娘们问明白了，原来林大爷建议队上安排民兵看场，没有引起队干部的重视，林大爷气火了。这时，小邓指着林大爷胸前说：“大爷，你那语录牌上面写的是什么？”林大爷回答说：“为人民服务”。“怎样为人民服务啊？”“完全、彻底呗！”林大爷心里顿时开了窍，气消了一半。姑娘们紧接着跟了一句，天真地说：“你提了个意见，人家没有马上答复，你就生气了，你没想想挟着行李回家不干了，引不引人生气啊？”林大爷不由得笑了起来，向着这些可爱的年轻人大声说：“我得向你们学习啊！”姑娘们回答说：“毛主席他老人家七十多岁了，为了中国革命和世界革命，还日日夜夜地操劳，咱们还有什么困难不能克服呢？为了捍卫毛主席，捍卫毛泽东思想，捍卫毛主席的革命路线，就是上刀山，下火海，我们也要高高兴兴地战斗下去。”林大爷二话没说，当即挟起行李又回到了饲养处。
    象这样的故事有许多许多。贫下中农都称赞说：这些姑娘到乡下来，给咱们带来了毛泽东思想。
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”姑娘们就是靠着战无不胜的毛泽东思想，走过了两年战斗的历程。她们深有体会地说：“只有毛泽东思想在头脑中扎根落户，人才能在农村中扎根落户。”最近，她们作为下乡知识青年民兵班，被选为沈阳部队活学活用毛泽东思想先进集体。
    流水欢歌，群山起舞。红太阳照亮了山村的大地，照红了姑娘们的心。用毛泽东思想武装起来的青年人，正迎着灿烂的朝阳，乘着无产阶级文化大革命的浩荡东风，在火热的阶级斗争中迅速成长。
