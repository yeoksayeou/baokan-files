The reactionaries' bloody suppression cannot intimidate the French revolutionary masses who have inherited the glorious tradition of the Paris Commune. In recent days, progressive students and workers in Paris, defying the reactionary decree banning mass demonstrations, have continued to hold meetings and marches to protest against the violent suppression of students and workers by the French ruling clique.

The French ruling clique, burned by the revolutionary struggle of the French people, has, with the help of the French Communist Party revisionist leadership and other traitorous labor bosses, used every means of coercion and inducement to try to split the united front of workers and students. In recent days, it has more brazenly revealed its ugly face, ruthlessly attacking the progressive workers and students. On the 10th, French police killed a Paris student supporting the workers' anti-violence struggle in the Paris suburbs, and on the 11th, they shot a worker at the Peugeot car factory in the eastern French city of Sochaux who was steadfast in his strike. On the 12th and 13th, the French government brazenly declared a ban on "any demonstrations and marches" and forcibly disbanded eleven workers' and students' organizations.

Following this, reactionary police conducted searches on some of these organizations and arrested a large number of progressive students and workers. The French reactionaries foolishly believe that they can extinguish the revolutionary fire of the French people through bloody suppression.

However, as our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality, they are not so powerful. All the reactionaries' schemes are to use slaughter to eliminate the revolution. They think that the more people they kill, the smaller the revolution will be. But contrary to these reactionary subjective wishes, the fact is that the more people the reactionaries kill, the greater the revolutionary force becomes, and the closer the reactionaries come to their doom. This is an irresistible law."

The atrocities of the French ruling clique not only fail to intimidate the French people with their revolutionary traditions but also make them more determined to persist in their just struggle. On the 15th, more than five thousand Paris students and workers held a grand funeral for the 18-year-old student Guy Ternet, who was killed by the police while supporting the struggle of the workers at the Renault car company's Flins factory, to express their indignant protest against the French ruling clique's massacre of the youth. At the head of the vast funeral procession, the deceased's comrades carried a large red wreath. They held up Chairman Mao's quotation: "Thousands upon thousands of martyrs have heroically sacrificed their lives for the people's interests in front of us. Let us hold high their banner and march forward along the path they have blazed with their blood!"

More than five thousand sons and daughters of the Paris Commune, filled with grief and indignation, sang the "Internationale" loudly, carrying their comrade's body to the grave. Along the way, they raised tightly clenched fists, indicating that they would continue the fight.

On the evening of the 14th, several thousand students, teachers, and workers in Paris held a meeting at the Palais de la Mutualité to protest against the French ruling clique's bloody suppression of the workers' and students' movements and to protest against the dissolution of workers' and students' organizations. Students and workers' representatives spoke at the meeting, severely condemning the French ruling clique and its running dogs—the French Communist Party revisionist leadership—for splitting the united front of workers and students, and for suppressing and destroying the just struggles of workers and students. They called on French workers and students to unite and launch a mass counterattack against the French ruling clique's violent suppression of the revolutionary masses.

In Nantes, students defied the reactionary ban and held a demonstration on the evening of the 14th, bravely fighting against the police who came to suppress them.

Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of industrial workers in France's key industries such as automobiles, shipbuilding, and metallurgy are still on strike. The workers of the giant automobile factories Renault, Peugeot, Citroën, and Berliet, who are at the forefront of this unprecedented massive strike in France, have repeatedly foiled the reactionaries' and their running dogs' plots to sabotage the strike, demonstrating their tenacious fighting spirit. More than sixty thousand workers of the Renault car company have been on strike since May 16, and today they have entered the second month of their struggle. The staff and reporters of the French National Radio and Television, the mouthpiece of the French government, are still on strike despite government suppression. Their struggle has received widespread support from French workers, students, and artists.

The French Communist Party revisionist leadership, which hates the rebellious actions of French workers and students to the core and is doing everything it can to sabotage them, shamelessly supports the French government's reactionary measures to dissolve workers' and students' organizations. The revisionist organ *L'Humanité* gleefully published in full the French government's brazen declaration to dissolve these organizations. The General Confederation of Labor executive committee, controlled by the revisionists, passed a resolution on the 15th, viciously attacking progressive workers and students as "leftist adventurists" and shamelessly boasting about the reactionary role played by the General Confederation of Labor in sabotaging the revolutionary mass movement, thus collaborating with the French ruling clique to suppress the progressive workers' and students' movements and curry favor with the French ruling clique.

The treacherous acts of the revisionist clique are so blatant that some Western European bourgeois newspapers cannot help but admit that the French government and the French Communist Party leadership are "helping each other out," acting in cahoots. They point out that the revisionists have "temporarily saved" the French government in inducing workers to return to work, while the French government's action of dissolving workers' and students' organizations has "notably helped the Communist Party (referring to the revisionists—editor)."

    法修百般破坏工人学生正义斗争，无耻向统治集团邀功请赏
    据新华社十六日讯  巴黎消息：法国统治集团的血腥镇压吓不倒继承了巴黎公社光荣传统的法国革命群众。连日来，巴黎进步学生和工人不顾禁止群众示威的反动法令，继续举行集会游行，抗议法国统治集团镇压学生和工人运动的暴行。
    被法国人民革命斗争的烈火烧得焦头烂额的法国统治集团，在法共修正主义领导集团和其他形形色色的工贼叛徒的帮助下，耍尽威逼利诱的手段，力图分化工人和学生的战斗队伍。这几天它更加赤裸裸地露出狰狞面目，悍然对法国进步的工人和学生开刀。十日，法国警察在巴黎郊区杀害了一个支援工人抗暴斗争的巴黎学生后，十一日又在法国东部城市索肖枪杀了一位坚持罢工的普吉奥汽车工厂工人。十二日和十三日，法国政府悍然宣布禁止“举行任何示威游行”，并强行解散十一个工人和学生组织。
    接着，反动警察就对其中一些组织进行了搜查，并大肆逮捕进步的学生和工人。法国反动派妄想依靠血腥镇压来扑灭法国人民革命斗争的怒火。
    可是，正如我们的伟大导师毛主席所指出的：“一切反动派的企图是想用屠杀的办法消灭革命，他们以为杀人越多革命就会越小。但是和这种反动的主观愿望相反，事实是反动派杀人越多，革命的力量就越大，反动派就越接近于灭亡。这是一条不可抗拒的法则。”
    法国统治集团的暴行不仅吓不倒有着革命传统的法国人民，反而促使他们更坚决地坚持正义斗争。巴黎学生和工人五千多人，十五日为在支持雷诺汽车公司弗兰工厂工人的斗争中被警察杀害的十八岁的学生纪耶·托坦举行盛大的葬礼，对法国统治集团屠杀青年的罪行表示愤怒的抗议。在浩浩荡荡的送葬行列的前面，死者生前的战友抬着一个红色的大花圈。他们举着毛主席的语录：“成千成万的先烈，为着人民的利益，在我们的前头英勇地牺牲了，让我们高举起他们的旗帜，踏着他们的血迹前进吧！”
    五千多巴黎公社的英雄儿女，满怀悲愤高唱着《国际歌》，把他们的战友的遗体送到墓地。他们沿途高举紧握着的拳头，表示他们要继续战斗下去。
    十四日晚上，好几千名巴黎的学生、教师和工人，在团结宫举行大会，抗议法国统治集团血腥镇压工人和学生运动，并无理解散工人和学生组织。学生和工人的代表在会上纷纷发言，严正谴责法国统治集团和它的走狗——法修领导集团分化工人和学生的战斗团结，镇压和破坏工人和学生的正义斗争的罪行。他们号召法国的工人和学生团结起来，对法国统治集团镇压革命群众的暴行进行群众性的反击。
    在南特，学生们不顾反动的禁令，十四日晚上也举行了示威游行，同前来镇压的警察英勇搏斗。
    与此同时，法国的汽车、造船、冶金等重要工业部门的几十万产业工人，仍在坚持罢工。站在法国这次空前猛烈的大罢工斗争前列的雷诺、普吉奥、雪铁龙和贝利埃等巨大汽车工厂的工人们，一次又一次地粉碎了反动派及其走狗破坏罢工的阴谋诡计，显示了他们顽强的战斗精神。六万多雷诺汽车公司的工人从五月十六日带头占领工厂起，到今天已进入斗争的第二个月。法国政府的喉舌——法国国家广播电视台的职工和记者，不顾政府的镇压，仍在坚持罢工。他们的斗争得到法国的工人、学生、艺术工作者广泛的支持。
    对法国工人和学生的造反行动恨得要死，不遗余力地进行破坏的法共修正主义领导集团，厚颜无耻地支持法国政府解散工人和学生组织的反动措施。法修机关报《人道报》幸灾乐祸地全文刊登了法国政府悍然解散这些组织的声明。法修控制的总工会执行局十五日还通过决议，恶毒地攻击进步工人和学生是“左倾冒险分子”，并无耻地吹嘘总工会在破坏革命群众运动中所起的反动作用，以此配合法国统治集团镇压进步工人、学生运动，并向法国统治集团邀功请赏。
    法修集团的这些叛卖行径是如此露骨，以致一些西欧资产阶级报刊也不得不承认，法国政府和法修领导集团是在“互相帮忙”，狼狈为奸。它们指出，法修在诱压工人复工方面是“暂时拯救了”法国政府，而法国政府解散工人和学生组织的行动则是“显著地给共产党（指法修——编者）帮了忙”。
