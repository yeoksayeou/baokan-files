President Julius K. Nyerere of the United Republic of Tanzania, at the invitation of the Chinese government, is visiting China on a state visit and arrived in Beijing today. President Nyerere once again brings the deep affection of the Tanzanian people and the African people to the Chinese people. The seven hundred million Chinese people are extremely excited and express the warmest welcome to our brothers and comrades from the anti-imperialist front in Africa.

At a time when our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is achieving comprehensive victories, President Nyerere's visit to China is a great support and encouragement to our people. President Nyerere will personally see the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which was personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao. Our country is full of vigorous revolutionary scenes. The revolutionary spirit of the seven hundred million people armed with Mao Zedong Thought is more vibrant, and industrial and agricultural production is thriving. Socialist China has never been as strong as it is today.

The people of China and Tanzania have a long history of traditional friendship. In the long struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism, we have always supported and encouraged each other. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations, friendly cooperation in politics, economy, culture, and other fields has developed significantly. In 1964, Second Vice President Rashidi M. Kawawa visited China and signed an economic and technical cooperation agreement with our country. In February 1965, President Nyerere visited China and signed a friendship treaty with our country. In June of the same year, Premier Zhou Enlai of our country visited Tanzania. The mutual visits of the leaders of the two countries have made significant contributions to enhancing the friendship between the two peoples. The friendly cooperation between China and Tanzania has set a good example for solidarity and cooperation among Asian and African countries.

The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, teaches us: "We, the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who love freedom and independence, are all fighting against colonialism. ... The colonialists hope that we will not unite, not cooperate, not be friendly. We must use strengthened unity, strengthened friendly cooperation to answer them, and we must make the colonialists' plots completely fail."

The continuous strengthening of the fighting unity and friendly cooperation between the people of China and Tanzania is a powerful blow to imperialism and old and new colonialism led by the United States.

The Chinese people have always expressed admiration and firm support for the Tanzanian people's just struggle to firmly oppose imperialist interference and subversion and to safeguard national independence and state sovereignty under the leadership of President Nyerere. The Tanzanian people have made unremitting efforts to develop their national economy and culture, to eliminate the remnants of colonialism, and have achieved new successes. Currently, under the inspiration of the self-reliance spirit of the Arusha Declaration, the Tanzanian people are using their own hardworking hands to build their own country. The Tanzanian government and people have made active contributions to supporting the African national liberation movement. The international prestige of the United Republic of Tanzania is increasingly high. The Chinese people are genuinely happy about this. Recently, Tanzania has firmly opposed the political deception of the "non-proliferation treaty" concocted by the United States and the Soviet Union. This righteous action of defying violence has won the praise of people all over the world.

Today, we are in a great new era of world revolution. The anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the world's people is on the rise. The national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are thriving. The heroic Vietnamese people are persisting in their struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, dealing heavier and heavier blows to American imperialism. The people of Europe and North America have new awakenings and are launching fierce struggles against the rule of the monopoly bourgeoisie. Imperialism and all old and new colonialism led by the United States are facing serious political and economic crises and are having a harder and harder time. The days of imperialism and colonialism will not be long.

Let the people of China and Tanzania further unite, let the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America further unite, let the people of the world further unite, and strive together to completely bury the system of imperialism and colonialism!

    热烈欢迎尼雷尔总统
    坦桑尼亚联合共和国总统朱利叶斯·克·尼雷尔，应我国政府的邀请，来我国进行国事访问，今天到达北京。尼雷尔总统再一次带来了坦桑尼亚人民和非洲人民对中国人民的深情厚谊。七亿中国人民以十分兴奋的心情，对于来自非洲反帝前线的兄弟和战友表示最热烈的欢迎。
    当我国无产阶级文化大革命正在取得全面胜利的时候，尼雷尔总统前来我国访问，这是对我国人民巨大的支持和鼓舞。尼雷尔总统将亲眼看到我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成果。我国到处一片蓬蓬勃勃的革命景象，用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿人民的革命精神更加焕发，工农业生产欣欣向荣。社会主义中国从来没有象今天这样的强大。
    中国和坦桑尼亚两国人民有着悠久的传统友谊。我们在反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的长期斗争中，从来都是相互支持、相互鼓舞的。两国建交以后，在政治、经济、文化等各方面的友好合作关系得到了巨大的发展。一九六四年，拉希迪·姆·卡瓦瓦第二副总统访问我国，同我国签订了经济技术合作协定；一九六五年二月，尼雷尔总统访华，同我国签订了两国友好条约；同年六月，我国周恩来总理访问了坦桑尼亚。中坦两国领导人的相互访问，对于增进两国人民的友谊，作出了重大的贡献。中国和坦桑尼亚两国的友好合作关系，为亚非国家之间的团结合作树立了良好的范例。
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“我们亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲爱好自由和独立的人民，都在反对殖民主义。……殖民主义者希望我们不团结，不合作，不友好。我们必须用加强团结、加强友好合作来回答它们，我们必须使殖民主义者的阴谋彻底破产。”
    中国和坦桑尼亚两国人民的战斗团结和友好合作的不断增强，是对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的有力打击。
    中国人民对于坦桑尼亚人民在尼雷尔总统的领导下，坚决反对帝国主义干涉和颠覆、维护民族独立和国家主权的正义斗争，一向表示钦佩和坚决支持。坦桑尼亚人民为发展民族经济和民族文化、肃清殖民主义残余势力，进行了不懈的努力，并不断取得新的成就。目前，坦桑尼亚人民正在《阿鲁沙宣言》自力更生精神的鼓舞下，用自己勤劳的双手，努力建设自己的国家。坦桑尼亚政府和人民在支援非洲民族解放运动方面作出了积极的贡献。坦桑尼亚联合共和国的国际威望日益增高。中国人民为此感到由衷的高兴。最近，坦桑尼亚坚决反对美苏炮制的“防止核扩散”条约的政治骗局，这种不畏强暴的正义行动，赢得了全世界人民的赞扬。
    今天，我们正处在一个世界革命的伟大新时代。世界人民的反帝革命斗争正呈现出新的高涨。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族解放运动蓬勃发展。英勇的越南人民坚持抗美救国斗争正在给予美帝国主义以越来越沉重的打击。欧洲、北美的人民群众有了新的觉醒，掀起反对垄断资产阶级统治的猛烈的斗争风暴。以美国为首的帝国主义面临着严重的政治危机和经济危机，日子越来越不好过。帝国主义和一切新老殖民主义的寿命，决不会很长了。
    中国人民和坦桑尼亚人民进一步团结起来，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民进一步团结起来，全世界人民进一步团结起来，为彻底埋葬帝国主义和殖民主义制度而共同奋斗！
