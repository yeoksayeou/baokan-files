Members of the Revolutionary Committee Learn from the Masses, Summarize Mass Experiences, and Guide Overall Work

The Revolutionary Committee of Boluo County, Guangdong Province, has been strengthened and developed in class struggle.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 28 — Under the assistance of the People's Liberation Army's support-leftist troops, the leadership of the Revolutionary Committee of Boluo County, Guangdong Province, has gone deep into the front lines of class struggle, leading the broad revolutionary masses to bravely advance in the stormy waves of class struggle. This has strengthened and developed the newly born Revolutionary Committee.

Into the Stormy Waves of Class Struggle

To Face Wind and Rain with the Masses

In January of this year, the Revolutionary Committee of Boluo County was born in glory. In this favorable situation, some people had the idea of taking a breath of relief, wanting to go to the county government offices to sit down and engage in "normal" work, relaxing in class struggle. This raised a sharp question: What kind of Revolutionary Committee should be built? What is the fundamental task of the Revolutionary Committee? The stationed troops and the armed department's "three supports, two militaries" personnel immediately raised this question with the members of the Revolutionary Committee, studying Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle and closely linking with the masses, wholeheartedly serving the people. They severely criticized the "class struggle extinction" theory of China's Khrushchev and his advocacy of the reactionary revisionist fallacy of becoming an official and acting like a lord. This made the leadership of the Revolutionary Committee realize that the tasks of the Revolutionary Committee are countless, and the work is myriad, but the most fundamental is to use Mao Zedong Thought to hold power well and use power well, to grasp class struggle, to closely link with the masses, and to run a Mao Zedong Thought school in the midst of the great storms of struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines. Every member of the Revolutionary Committee should be a model of wholeheartedly serving the people, never leaving the masses. Especially in the situation where the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is nearing complete victory, class struggle is more complex and profound, and the work tasks are more arduous and more difficult, it is even more necessary to follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "the most fundamental thing in the reform of state organs is to link with the masses," to go to the masses, and to struggle with the masses in the stormy waves of class struggle. Based on this heightened understanding, the Revolutionary Committee, except for leaving one or two leaders to handle daily work, sent the rest of the members and 80% of the office staff to the grassroots level.

After the leadership of the Revolutionary Committee went to the grassroots level, how could they better play their roles? At this time, the stationed troops and the armed department's "three supports, two militaries" personnel discovered that some people were always worried about overall work. Although they were in factories and villages, they would always walk around and look around, unable to stay put or sit down. Facing this situation, they again studied Chairman Mao's teachings with the leadership of the Revolutionary Committee: "Any work task, if there is no general and universal call, cannot mobilize the broad masses to take action. But if it is limited to a general call, and the leaders do not specifically and directly implement the work called for in several organizations, break through one point, gain experience, and then use this experience to guide other units, ... there is the danger of the general call becoming empty." Through study, they realized that whether or not one can truly break through one point and gain experience is a key issue in truly going to the masses. Only by seriously settling down in one point can one truly struggle with the masses in class struggle and truly be heart to heart with the masses. After raising their understanding, the Revolutionary Committee immediately proposed that all levels of leading cadres must grasp typical examples, set models, and achieve progress in every field and at every level, setting models of both advanced and backward units becoming advanced.

Focus on Points, Bloom on the Surface

After the leadership of the Revolutionary Committee went deep into the points, they followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "putting down the stinky framework and humbly being a student" and, with the attitude of ordinary laborers, ate, lived, worked, studied, and criticized and repudiated revisionism with the broad masses of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants. In this way, they were deeply among the masses, better heard the opinions of the masses, understood the active thoughts of the masses, and summarized the experiences of the masses. Thus, the Revolutionary Committee, in the myriad tasks of work, both grasped the center and the fundamentals and solved the problem of "how to grasp." In the early days of the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, most of its members realized that further launching a new high tide of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, grasping class struggle, and carrying out revolutionary criticism and repudiation was the fundamental and central task of the work. However, how to launch a new high tide? Everyone was not quite sure. Boluo County had already produced two advanced models of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in 1966: Huangshandong Production Brigade and Yuye Commune Fishery Brigade. After the start of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, another advanced model that grew up in revolutionary criticism and repudiation emerged: Longhua Brigade. Under the influence of these advanced models, the movements of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and revolutionary criticism and repudiation in the entire county continuously produced new situations, and all aspects were done very well. What method should be used to launch a new high tide? This problem, which was repeatedly discussed in meetings but difficult to solve, was quickly solved when it came to the "point" and through "five together" with the masses and seeking advice from the masses. They discovered in their heart-to-heart talks with the masses that some people said, "Revolutionary criticism has been going on for more than a year, and if we criticize again, it's like reheating cold food," "It's almost all criticized, and we should establish more." They realized from these active thoughts that the main obstacle at present is the insufficient understanding of the new situation and new characteristics of class struggle. Therefore, they studied Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle" and Chairman Mao's latest instruction on the proletarian cultural revolution at the points with the masses, learning together to further unveil the cover of class struggle. The shocking facts of class struggle deeply educated the broad masses, making them realize that whether or not to grasp class struggle and carry out revolutionary criticism and repudiation is a top priority in whether or not to have proletarian dictatorship and socialism, and a top priority in whether or not to be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. After raising their understanding, revolutionary criticism and repudiation quickly produced a new high tide, effectively raising the class struggle awareness and two-line struggle awareness of the commune members.

The leadership of the Revolutionary Committee also went deep into some backward units with more problems and more complex struggles, setting models of backward units becoming advanced.

After setting up various types of model points, in order to better promote the experiences of the model points, the county Revolutionary Committee, in addition to making a decision to learn from Huangshandong, Longhua, and Fishery Brigades and calling on the entire county to catch up with the advanced models, also made a decision of "five at the points," that is: investigation at the points, practice at the points, experience exchange at the points, work research at the points, and holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes at the points. The county Revolutionary Committee not only held various on-site meetings and experience exchange meetings at these three model points but also moved all major large-scale study classes in the entire county to the points to hold and selected a batch of activists from the points to form a team to lecture on studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, traveling around the entire county to give lectures. In this way, the experiences of the points played a better role in guiding the overall work, quickly forming a situation of focusing on points and blooming on the surface in the entire county, with Huangshandong, Longhua, and Fishery Brigades as models. The movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought among the masses in the entire county produced a new situation, revolutionary criticism and repudiation produced a new high tide, and the revolutionary great alliance in the entire county became more and more consolidated, with production booming.

Humbly Learn from the Masses, Promote Thought Revolutionization

Chairman Mao teaches: "The masses are the real heroes, and we ourselves are often childish and laughable. Not understanding this point, one cannot obtain even the most basic knowledge." The members of the Boluo County Revolutionary Committee repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teaching, humbly learning from the masses and promoting thought revolutionization in the process of running the points. When they went to the grassroots level for meetings, they generally did not take cars or boats. They also followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "external causes are conditions for change, and internal causes are the basis for change," correctly handling the "three relationships": going deep into the grassroots level to lead the masses to hold study classes, promoting the thought revolutionization of the Revolutionary Committee members, relying both on the help of the masses and on subjective efforts; being both a student and a teacher of the masses, but first being a student of the masses; being both a force and an object of the revolution, continuously raising the awareness of self-revolution. A vice chairman of the county Revolutionary Committee went deep into a production team and was deeply moved by the boundless proletarian feelings of the poor and lower-middle peasants for Chairman Mao. He sincerely took the poor and lower-middle peasants as his teachers, asking them to give class education and criticism and repudiation of selfishness and revisionism, conducting self-examination and finding gaps, greatly promoting thought revolutionization. Some members of the Revolutionary Committee often went to the masses to expose and criticize their selfishness, humbly seeking the opinions of the masses, greatly strengthening the relationship with the masses.

The members of the Boluo County Revolutionary Committee went deep into the masses, rooted among the masses, and led the masses to bravely advance in the stormy waves of class struggle. They not only did a better job in all aspects of work but also further promoted the thought revolutionization of the members of the Revolutionary Committee, making the Revolutionary Committee continuously strengthened and developed. Now, they are summarizing the experiences of the previous period to better go deep into the front lines of class struggle, turning the Revolutionary Committee into a strong command post of class struggle and turning the entire county into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

    革命委员会成员到基层以后怎样才能更好地发挥作用？
    向群众学习　总结群众经验　指导全面工作
    广东省博罗县革委会在阶级斗争中得到巩固和发展
    新华社广州二十八日电　广东省博罗县革命委员会领导成员，在解放军支左部队帮助下，深入阶级斗争第一线，带领广大革命群众迎着阶级斗争的大风浪奋勇前进，使新生的革命委员会得到巩固和发展。
    到阶级斗争的大风浪里
    同群众一道经风雨见世面
    今年一月间，博罗县革命委员会光荣诞生。在这大好形势下，有些人出现松一口气思想，想到县城机关坐下来，转入“正常”工作，放松了阶级斗争。这就提出了一个尖锐的问题：建设一个什么样的革命委员会？革命委员会的根本任务是什么？驻军和武装部“三支”“两军”工作人员立即带着这个问题，和革委会成员一道学习毛主席关于阶级、阶级斗争的教导和密切联系群众、全心全意为人民服务的教导，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论以及他鼓吹的当官作老爷的反革命修正主义谬论，使革命委员会的领导成员认识到：革委会的任务千条万条，工作千头万绪，最根本的就是用毛泽东思想掌好权、用好权，狠抓阶级斗争，密切联系群众，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的大风大浪里，办好毛泽东思想大学校。革委会的每一个成员，应该是全心全意为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众的模范。特别是在无产阶级文化大革命接近全面胜利，阶级斗争更复杂、更深刻，工作任务更繁重、更艰巨的情况下，更应根据毛主席关于“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众”的教导，到群众中去，和群众一起，在阶级斗争的大风浪里摸爬滚打。在提高认识的基础上，革委会除留一、二名领导成员在家主持日常工作外，其余成员和百分之八十的机关干部都深入基层。
    革委会的领导成员到了基层以后，怎样才能更好地发挥作用呢？这时，驻军和武装部“三支”“两军”工作人员又发现：一些人总是担心全面工作，虽然身在工厂、农村，却总是东走走，西看看，蹲不住，坐不下。针对这一情况，他们又和革委会的领导成员一起学习了毛主席的教导：“任何工作任务，如果没有一般的普遍的号召，就不能动员广大群众行动起来。但如果只限于一般号召，而领导人员没有具体地直接地从若干组织将所号召的工作深入实施，突破一点，取得经验，然后利用这种经验去指导其他单位，……就有使一般号召归于落空的危险。”通过学习，他们认识到，能否真正突破一点，取得经验，这是一个能否真正到群众中去的关键问题。只有认真地扎到一个点里，才能真正和群众一起在阶级斗争中摸爬滚打，才能真正和群众心连心。认识提高后，革委会立即提出：各级领导干部都要抓典型，树样板，做到行行有点，层层有点，既树先进更先进的样板，又树后进变先进的样板。
    点上下功夫　面上开红花
    县革委会领导成员深入点里以后，遵照毛主席“放下臭架子、甘当小学生”的教导，以普通劳动者的姿态，和广大工人、贫下中农同吃，同住，同劳动，同学习，同斗私批修。这样，就使他们深入于群众之中，更好地听到群众的意见，了解到群众的活思想，总结到群众的经验，从而使革委会在千头万绪的工作中，既抓到了中心，抓住了根本，又解决了“抓”的方法问题。革委会成立的初期，革委会绝大部分成员认识到，进一步掀起活学活用毛泽东思想新高潮，狠抓阶级斗争，开展革命大批判，是工作中的根本和中心。但是，怎样才能掀起新高潮呢？大家心中就不是十分有数。博罗县早在一九六六年就出现了黄山洞大队和铁场公社渔业大队两个活学活用毛泽东思想的先进样板，无产阶级文化大革命开始以后，又出现了在革命大批判中成长起来的先进样板——龙华大队。在这些先进样板的带动下，全县的活学活用毛泽东思想和革命大批判运动，不断出现新局面，各方面都搞得很不错了，用什么办法再掀起新高潮呢？这个在会议上反复讨论而难以解决的问题，一到了“点”上，在和群众“五同”，向群众请教中，很快得到解决。他们在和群众谈心中，发现一些人说“大批判进行一年多了，再批，那是炒冷饭”，“破得差不多了，应该大立了。”他们从这些活思想中认识到，当前的主要障碍是对阶级斗争的新形势、新特点认识不足。于是，他们在点上和群众一起，学习毛主席的“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，学习毛主席“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续”的最新指示，同群众一道，进一步大揭阶级斗争盖子。惊心动魄的阶级斗争事实深深地教育着广大群众，从而认识到抓不抓阶级斗争，搞不搞革命大批判，是要不要无产阶级专政、要不要社会主义的头等大事，是忠不忠于毛主席、忠不忠于毛泽东思想、忠不忠于毛主席革命路线的头等大事。认识提高以后，革命的大批判很快出现了新高潮，有效地提高了社员的阶级斗争觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟。
    县革委会的领导成员，还深入到一些问题较多、斗争较复杂的后进单位，树立了后进变先进的样板。
    树立起各种类型的样板点以后，为了更好地推广样板点的经验，县革委会除了作出学习黄山洞、龙华、渔业三个大队的决定，号召全县向先进样板看齐外，还作出了“五在点”的决定，即：调查在点，实践在点，经验交流在点，工作研究在点，办毛泽东思想学习班在点。县革委会不但在这三个样板点上开各种现场会、经验交流会，还把全县各种主要的大型的学习班搬到点上去办，并且从点上抽调一批积极分子组成活学活用毛泽东思想讲用团，到全县各地巡回讲用。这样，就使点上的经验起了更好地指导面上工作的作用，使全县迅速形成一个以黄山洞、龙华、渔业三个大队为样板的比学赶帮运动，出现了点上下功夫、面上开红花的新景象，全县活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动出现了新局面，革命大批判出现了新高潮，全县的革命大联合也越来越巩固，生产一片热气腾腾。
    虚心向群众学习　搞好思想革命化
    毛主席教导说：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”博罗县革委会成员反复学习毛主席这一教导，在办点的过程中虚心向群众学习，搞好思想革命化。他们在来往基层开会时，一般都不乘车，不坐船。他们还根据毛主席“外因是变化的条件，内因是变化的根据”的教导，做到正确处理好“三个关系”：深入基层带领群众开办学习班，搞好革委会成员的思想革命化，既要依靠群众的帮助，又要依靠主观的努力；既要做群众的学生，又要做群众的先生，但首先要做群众的学生；既要做革命的一份力量，又要做革命的对象，不断提高自我革命的自觉性。县革委会的一位副主任深入一个生产队，深为贫下中农无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级感情所感动，他真诚地拜贫下中农为师，请贫下中农上阶级教育课，上斗私批修课，进行对照找差距，大大促进了思想革命化。革委会有的成员经常到群众中去亮私斗私，虚心征求群众意见，大大密切了和群众的关系。
    博罗县革委会成员深入群众，扎根于群众，带领群众在阶级斗争的大风浪中奋勇前进，不仅把各项工作做得更好，而且进一步促进了革委会成员的思想革命化，使革委会不断巩固、发展。现在，他们正在总结前段的经验，以便更好地深入阶级斗争第一线，把革委会办成阶级斗争的坚强指挥部，把全县办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
