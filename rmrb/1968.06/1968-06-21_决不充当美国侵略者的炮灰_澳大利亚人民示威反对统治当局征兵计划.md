People in various parts of Australia began demonstrations on June 19 to oppose the Australian government's intensified efforts to recruit cannon fodder for U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam and to support the demands of Australian aboriginal people for land.

In Sydney, about 100 students on June 20 rushed into the office building of the Minister of National Service, staged a sit-in in front of his office, and opposed conscription and the government's intensified implementation of the conscription law.

When the police arrived at the scene to threaten the students, the students still refused to leave. They shouted at the police, "We won't go!" They also chanted slogans against the aggressive war and angrily declared that they would never become cannon fodder for the U.S. aggression in Vietnam.

When the police forcibly dragged the demonstrating students away from the office door, the crowd gathered outside the building expressed strong support for the students' just struggle. The students told the crowd that they would stage larger-scale demonstrations.

In Melbourne, 60 students on June 19 held a protest meeting in front of the Bentridge Prison, condemning the Australian government's sentencing of a demonstrator who participated in the anti-conscription demonstration earlier this year to 14 days in prison.

Hundreds of black and white Australians took joint action for the first time on June 19, holding day-and-night demonstrations in front of the Australian Parliament Building and government offices to support the aboriginal people's demand for land.

The demonstrators held up banners and sang protest songs, and distributed leaflets to passersby.

In Melbourne, more than 100 demonstrators on June 19 braved the cold to hold an all-night demonstration to support the aboriginal people's demand for land.
