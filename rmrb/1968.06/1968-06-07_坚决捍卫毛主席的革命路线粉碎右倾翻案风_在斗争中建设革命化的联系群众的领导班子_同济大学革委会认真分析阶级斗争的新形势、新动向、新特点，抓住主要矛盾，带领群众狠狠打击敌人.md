In the course of struggle, build revolutionary committees that are linked with the masses.

The Shanghai Jiaotong University Revolutionary Committee has carefully analyzed the new situation, new trends, and new characteristics of class struggle, grasped the principal contradiction, and led the masses in a fierce attack on the enemy.

The editorial board notes: The experience of the Shanghai Jiaotong University Revolutionary Committee in grasping the principal contradiction and fiercely attacking a handful of class enemies has universal significance. We hope comrades will read it carefully.

"The revolutionary committee formed by the 'three-in-one combination' is a creation of the proletariat and the people in the current Cultural Revolution." It is a new thing that is constantly developing and improving. In daily work and relations between cadres and the masses, there are bound to be various shortcomings and mistakes. These problems, of course, need to be seriously addressed. However, if these problems are addressed while forgetting class struggle and relaxing vigilance against the desperate revenge plots of class enemies, it is easy to fall into a trap. As the revolutionary teachers and students of Jiaotong University have summarized, after the establishment of the revolutionary committee, the principal contradiction is still between the revolutionary cadres and the broad masses of revolutionary people and the traitors, spies, and a handful of unrepentant capitalist-roaders within the Party, as well as all open and hidden counter-revolutionaries; the focus of the struggle is still the issue of power, that is, the proletariat wants to consolidate the new revolutionary power, while the bourgeoisie wants to overthrow the new revolutionary power. Once this principal contradiction is grasped, other problems will be easily solved. This experience is well summarized.

All levels of revolutionary committees must remember the great teacher Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle," remember Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, always remember class struggle, always remember the dictatorship of the proletariat, always remember to emphasize politics, always remember to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and strive to build the revolutionary committee into a revolutionary, mass-linked, strong fighting command post.

According to a report from our newspaper, the Shanghai Jiaotong University Revolutionary Committee, following Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle," has carefully analyzed the new situation, new characteristics, and new trends of class struggle, grasped the principal contradiction, and led the masses in a deep and sustained revolutionary criticism, actively launching a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies, and smashing the enemy's plot to overthrow the revolutionary committee. In the great storm of class struggle, they have striven to build a revolutionary committee that is linked with the masses, and the entire school has presented an unprecedented revolutionary scene of vigor and vitality.

Carefully analyze the situation and grasp the principal contradiction

The deeper the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution approaches victory, the more complex and profound the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines becomes. The class enemies are not reconciled to their defeat and will use various means to make their last struggles. Soon after the establishment of the Jiaotong University Revolutionary Committee, some comrades did not clearly understand the new situation, new characteristics, and new trends of class struggle, and their vigilance against the enemy weakened. At that time, some masses demanded that the revolutionary committee focus on resolving the contradictions between the leading cadre and the masses. The leading cadres of the revolutionary committee also felt that there were many problems in their work and welcomed the masses to "shell them" to resolve the contradictions between the leading cadre and the masses and further improve relations with the masses.

At this time, a handful of unrepentant capitalist-roaders within the party and other class enemies jumped out, openly and secretly engaging in various activities. Some claimed to be "victims of the bourgeois reactionary line" and shouted for "rehabilitation"; some claimed to be "revolutionary cadres" and shouted for "reintegration"; some shouted that the "school revolutionary committee implemented a new bourgeois reactionary line" and that it was "the small bourgeois revolutionary cadres in power." They took the "three-in-one combination" revolutionary cadres to struggle against and attacked the revolutionary youngsters. When the school revolutionary committee held a meeting of representatives of revolutionary teachers, students, and staff, someone openly incited and attempted to engage in "legal" struggle to overthrow the revolutionary committee.

In such a complex situation, what is the principal contradiction? How to grasp the principal contradiction and change from passive to active? This sharp question was placed in front of the revolutionary committee.

Chairman Mao pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and its leadership and the broad revolutionary masses and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Chairman Mao's latest instructions illuminated the path forward. The school revolutionary committee felt that it was necessary to overcome the peaceful and complacent thinking of some comrades and strengthen the sense of the enemy. They immediately held a study class on Mao Zedong Thought for the standing committee members and organized the broad revolutionary masses and cadres to seriously study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, using Mao Zedong Thought to analyze the new situation, new characteristics, and new trends of class struggle in the school. "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power. The counter-revolutionaries' desperate struggle against the revolutionary forces is also entirely for the purpose of maintaining their power." Chairman Mao's teachings made the revolutionary teachers and students see through the phenomenon to the essence: a handful of class enemies took the revolutionary slogan of "revolutionizing the leading cadre" and deliberately spread the fallacy that the "principal contradiction is between the revolutionary committee and the masses," engaging in open "legal" struggle and covert struggle, attempting to muddy the waters, shift the direction of the struggle, and achieve their evil goal of overthrowing the newly established revolutionary committee and returning to power themselves. The revolutionary teachers and students realized that this was the root cause of many problems that had arisen in the school in this period. The current main danger is rightist reversal: attempting to reverse the verdict on the bourgeois reactionary line, reverse the verdict on a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, and reverse the verdict on the overthrown class enemies. Therefore, it is necessary to launch a revolutionary criticism in a confrontational manner, resolutely defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, oppose rightist opportunism, rightist splitism, and rightist capitulationism, and fiercely attack the rightist reversal wind!

Deeply carry out revolutionary criticism and fiercely attack class enemies

Once the principal contradiction is grasped, other problems will be easily solved. The school revolutionary committee clearly pointed out to the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of the entire school: after the establishment of the revolutionary committee, the principal contradiction is still between the revolutionary cadres and the broad masses of revolutionary people and the traitors, spies, and a handful of unrepentant capitalist-roaders within the party, as well as all open and hidden counter-revolutionaries; the focus of the struggle is still the issue of power, that is, the proletariat wants to consolidate the new revolutionary power, while the bourgeoisie wants to overthrow the new revolutionary power. We must never forget this point. If we forget this point, we will forget the class enemies and lose our direction. The current central task is to hold high the great red banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought, continue to deeply and sustainably carry out revolutionary criticism, firmly grasp the initiative in the struggle against the enemy, and launch a fierce attack on the class enemies.

A magnificent wave of revolutionary criticism continued to deepen. The broad revolutionary masses held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, running through the red line of "seizing power and consolidating power," and launched a powerful offensive against a handful of class enemies, making the class enemies tremble with fear and fall into the vast sea of people's war.

The main characteristics of their revolutionary criticism are to take the teaching class (group) as the base point and implement the "three combinations."

First, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, combine revolutionary criticism with the national class struggle situation and the struggle-criticism-transformation of the unit. They believed that by grasping the new situation, new characteristics, and new trends of class struggle in each period, they could carry out revolutionary criticism in a targeted manner, which would have the greatest destructive power, making the criticism deep and lively, and able to be deep and sustained.

Second, combine the upper, middle, and lower levels to fiercely criticize a black line. This black line, at the top, is the handful of biggest capitalist-roaders within the party such as Liu Shaoqi, in the middle, is the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Shanghai party such as Chen Pixin and Cao Qiaozhou, and at the bottom, is the capitalist-roaders within the unit and other class enemies. They believed that only by combining these three aspects to carry out revolutionary criticism could they thoroughly overthrow the handful of biggest capitalist-roaders within the party, expose their agents, and eliminate the poison of their counter-revolutionary revisionism.

Third, closely combine big study, big criticism, and struggle against the enemy. In the study class, carry out revolutionary criticism, link it with the actual struggle against the enemy, study a segment of Chairman Mao's instructions, criticize a revisionist fallacy, share some insights, and solve a problem. In this way, through self-criticism and criticism of others, the revolutionary teachers and students' awareness of the two-line struggle was greatly enhanced. They said that this method was lively and effective.

They quickly broke through the system where the rightist reversal wind was the strongest. Then, they followed up and finally exposed the various tricks played by the class enemies and found the root of the rightist reversal. Originally, this handful of class enemies incited a group of people with serious rightist thoughts and anarchist thoughts to push them to the forefront to engage in various activities. A handful of class enemies secretly colluded with each other and plotted a set of tricks to overthrow the newly established revolutionary committee with leadership, organization, and planning.

Now, the proletarian revolutionary cadres of Jiaotong University have achieved a great victory. They smashed the evil plot of a handful of class enemies to overthrow the revolutionary committee, exposed the counter-revolutionary two-faced people and hidden class enemies, and purified the revolutionary ranks.

Strictly demand and pay attention to uniting those who have made mistakes

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution." After the broad masses were fully mobilized and launched a fierce offensive against the class enemies, the school revolutionary committee resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, guiding the masses to distinguish between two types of contradictions and directing the struggle firmly at a handful of class enemies. They emphasized that for those who made mistakes, even serious mistakes, in the rightist reversal activities of the class enemies, the Party's traditional policy of "punishing the past to educate the future and curing the sickness to save the patient" should be implemented. They should be strictly demanded, but also united. For those who made serious mistakes, first criticize their serious mistakes of participating in the reversal activities, and then strive to unite and lead them to participate in the struggle against the enemy. Some masses thought that those people were "old rightists," how could they be united? To address this active thought, the leading members of the school revolutionary committee went deep into the grassroots, talked heart-to-heart with these comrades, and studied Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on correctly handling the two types of contradictions together, quickly raising their ideological awareness.

After solving this problem, they immediately opened a study class on Mao Zedong Thought, organizing the proletarian revolutionary cadres and those who made mistakes, even serious mistakes, to study together. In the study class, everyone used Chairman Mao's instructions as a weapon to help those who made mistakes analyze the causes of their mistakes, which achieved good results. They deeply felt: "Whether Mao Zedong Thought is learned well or not, whether it is used flexibly or not, depends on whether the stance is firm or not in the complex class struggle and two-line struggle, and whether the major issues are clear or not. If the stance is wrong, everything is wrong." Some people, after raising their awareness, exposed the various crimes of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and counter-revolutionary two-faced people in attempting to overthrow the newly established revolutionary power. In this way, the majority of the masses were united, and a handful of class enemies were isolated.

In the class struggle, build the revolutionary committee

This struggle educated the masses, raised the awareness of class struggle and line struggle among the revolutionary teachers and students, and greatly promoted the revolutionary construction of the revolutionary committees at all levels. They realized that firmly grasping class struggle, mobilizing the masses to deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, and continuously attacking the class enemies is the fundamental way to build the revolutionary committee. They said: "In this way, we take the initiative, we are full of vigor, and we are closely linked with the masses."

The revolutionary committee is closely linked with the masses, and the most important thing is to arm the masses with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, lead the masses to fight against the class enemies, and raise the awareness of class struggle and line struggle among the masses. In this way, the revolutionary committee fundamentally represents the interests of the broad revolutionary masses.

In this heart-pounding class struggle, the leading members of the revolutionary committees at all levels of this school have always fought alongside the masses. They humbly learned from the masses, humbly listened to the opinions and criticisms of the masses, timely discovered problems, and solved problems. Some leading members also carried out the "one helps one, one pair of reds" activity with the masses, fought self-criticism and criticism of others together, promoted ideological revolutionization, and established deep revolutionary friendship. Everyone praised them as "both students of the masses and vanguard fighters." Some outstanding Communist Party members who have been tested in struggle were absorbed into the revolutionary committees at all levels. A batch of core forces of the proletarian revolutionary cadres were also gradually formed in the mass movement. In this way, the revolutionary committee was further consolidated, and the connection with the masses was strengthened.

Now, the revolutionary criticism of Jiaotong University burns in every corner, the study classes of Mao Zedong Thought are spread throughout the school, and the activities of "unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, unlimited loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line" are widely and deeply carried out. The revolutionary teachers and students are determined to fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, seriously learn from the brilliant deeds of Comrade Meng Hanzhong, a good cadre who is unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, advance with the momentum of victory, and seize the overall victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    坚决捍卫毛主席的革命路线粉碎右倾翻案风
    在斗争中建设革命化的联系群众的领导班子
    同济大学革委会认真分析阶级斗争的新形势、新动向、新特点，抓住主要矛盾，带领群众狠狠打击敌人
    编者按：　上海同济大学革命委员会，抓住主要矛盾，狠狠打击一小撮阶级敌人的经验，具有普遍意义。希望同志们认真地读一读。
    “‘三结合’的革命委员会，是工人阶级和人民群众在这次文化大革命中的一种创造。”它是新生事物，还在不断地发展和完善。在日常工作和干群关系等问题上，难免会出现这样或那样的缺点和错误。这些问题，当然需要认真解决。但是，如果因为解决这些问题而忘记了阶级斗争，放松了对阶级敌人的疯狂的报复阴谋的警惕性，那就很容易上当。正如同济大学革命师生们所总结的那样，革命委员会成立后，主要矛盾仍然是无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众同叛徒、特务、党内一小撮顽固不化的走资派以及一切公开的和暗藏的反革命分子之间的矛盾；斗争的焦点仍然是政权问题，即无产阶级要巩固新生的革命政权，资产阶级要颠覆新生的革命政权。捉住了这个主要矛盾，其他问题就迎刃而解了。这个经验概括得很好。
    各级革命委员会都要牢记伟大导师毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，牢记毛主席的亲密战友林彪副主席的指示，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，为把革命委员会建设成革命化的联系群众的坚强战斗指挥部而奋斗。
    本报讯　上海同济大学革命委员会遵照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，认真分析阶级斗争的新形势、新特点、新动向，抓住主要矛盾，带领群众深入持久地开展革命大批判，主动地向一小撮阶级敌人发动猛烈的进攻，粉碎了阶级敌人妄图颠覆革命委员会的阴谋活动。他们在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，努力建设革命化的联系群众的领导班子，全校出现了空前未有的朝气蓬勃的革命景象。
    认真分析形势　抓住主要矛盾
    无产阶级文化大革命越是接近全面胜利，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，越是复杂，越是深刻。阶级敌人不甘心于他们的失败，他们会用各种不同的方式作垂死的挣扎。同济大学革命委员会成立之后不久，一部分同志对于阶级斗争的新形势、新特点、新动向认识不清，敌情观念淡漠了，没有主动地带领广大革命师生狠抓阶级斗争。当时，部分群众要求革命委员会着重解决领导班子同群众的矛盾。革命委员会的领导成员也感到自己在工作中存在不少问题，表示欢迎群众“炮轰”，以解决领导班子同群众的矛盾，进一步改善和群众的关系。
    就在这个时候，党内一小撮死不悔改的走资派和其他阶级敌人跳了出来，明里暗里进行各种活动。有的说自己是“资产阶级反动路线的受害者”，叫喊要“平反”；有的说自己是“革命的领导干部”，叫喊要“结合”；有些人叫喊“校革命委员会执行了新的资产阶级反动路线”，“是小资产阶级革命派掌权”。他们把“三结合”的革命干部拉去批斗，并且攻击革命小将。校革命委员会召开全校革命师生员工代表会议时，有人公开煽动，妄图进行“合法”斗争，搞垮革命委员会。
    在这样错综复杂的情况中，什么是主要矛盾？怎样抓住主要矛盾由被动变为主动？这个尖锐的问题摆在革命委员会面前。
    毛主席极其深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”毛主席的最新指示照亮了前进的道路。校革命委员会感到，首先要克服部分同志的和平麻痹思想，加强敌情观念。他们立即举办常委毛泽东思想学习班，组织广大革命群众和干部认真地学习毛主席最新指示，用毛泽东思想来分析本校阶级斗争的新形势、新特点、新动向。“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”毛主席的教导，使革命师生透过现象看到了本质：一小撮阶级敌人把“领导班子革命化”这个革命口号接过去，极力散布“主要矛盾是革命委员会和群众的矛盾”的谬论，进行公开的“合法”斗争和隐蔽的斗争，妄图把水搅浑，转移斗争的大方向，以达到他们推翻新生的革命委员会，自己重新上台的罪恶目的。革命师生们认识到，这就是这一时期学校里出现的许多问题的症结。当前主要危险就是右倾翻案：妄想为资产阶级反动路线翻案，为党内一小撮走资派翻案，为被打倒的阶级敌人翻案。因此必须针锋相对地开展革命的大批判，坚决捍卫毛主席的革命路线，反对右倾机会主义、右倾分裂主义和右倾投降主义，狠狠打击右倾翻案妖风！
    深入开展革命大批判　狠狠打击阶级敌人
    捉住了主要矛盾，其他问题就迎刃而解。校革命委员会向全校革命师生员工明确地指出：在革命委员会成立之后，主要矛盾仍然是无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众同叛徒、特务、党内一小撮顽固不化的走资派以及一切公开的和暗藏的反革命分子之间的矛盾；斗争的焦点仍然是政权问题，即无产阶级要巩固新生的革命政权，资产阶级要颠覆新生的革命政权。我们任何时候都不要忘记这一点，如果忘记了这一点，就忘记了阶级敌人，迷失了方向。当前的中心任务，就是高举毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，继续深入持久地开展革命的大批判，牢牢把握对敌斗争的主动权，向阶级敌人发动猛烈的进攻。
    一场波澜壮阔的革命大批判的群众运动继续深入地展开了。广大革命群众高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，贯串“夺取政权，巩固政权”这条红线，人人口诛笔伐，对一小撮阶级敌人发起了强大的攻势，使阶级敌人心惊胆颤，陷于“人民战争”的汪洋大海之中。
    他们开展革命大批判的主要特点，是以教学班（组）为基点，实行了“三个结合”。
    第一，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，把革命的大批判同全国的阶级斗争形势、本单位的斗批改紧密结合起来。他们认为，掌握了每个时期阶级斗争的新形势、新特点、新动向，有的放矢地开展革命大批判，才有最大的杀伤力，既批得深、批得活，又能深入持久。
    第二，上、中、下结合起来，狠批一条黑线。这条黑线，上面是中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派，中间是上海党内一小撮走资派陈丕显、曹荻秋之流，下面是本单位的党内走资派及其他阶级敌人。他们认为，只有把这三方面结合起来，开展革命大批判，才能彻底打倒党内一小撮最大的走资派，批臭他们的代理人，肃清他们的反革命修正主义的流毒。
    第三，把大学习、大批判和对敌斗争紧密结合起来。在学习班里，开展革命大批判，联系对敌斗争实际，学一段毛主席指示，批一个修正主义谬论，讲一点心得体会，解决一个问题。这样，通过斗私批修，大大提高了革命师生的两条路线斗争觉悟。他们说，这样做生动活泼，立竿见影。
    他们很快从右倾翻案风刮得最厉害的一个系打开了缺口。接着，跟踪追击，终于揭露了阶级敌人玩弄的各种手段，找到了右倾翻案的根子。原来，这一小撮阶级敌人煽动一批有严重右倾思想和无政府主义思想的人，把他们推上第一线去进行各种活动。一小撮阶级敌人暗地里互相勾结，密谋策划了一套有领导、有组织、有计划地颠覆新生的革命委员会的诡计。
    现在，同济大学无产阶级革命派取得了重大的胜利。他们粉碎了一小撮阶级敌人妄图颠覆革命委员会的罪恶阴谋，揪出了反革命两面派和隐藏的阶级敌人，纯洁了革命队伍。
    既严格要求又注意团结犯了错误的人
    毛主席教导我们：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”当广大群众充分发动起来，向阶级敌人展开了猛烈的攻势之后，校革命委员会坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，引导群众区别两类不同性质的矛盾，把斗争矛头紧紧对准一小撮阶级敌人。他们强调指出，对于在阶级敌人的右倾翻案活动中，犯有错误甚至严重错误的人，要采取党的“惩前毖后，治病救人”的传统政策，既要严格要求他们，又要注意团结他们。对于犯了严重错误的人，首先批判他们参加翻案活动的严重错误，然后争取和团结他们参加对敌斗争。有些群众认为，那些人是“老右倾”，怎么能团结他们？针对这种活思想，校革命委员会的领导成员深入到基层，找这些同志谈心，一起学习毛主席关于正确处理两类不同性质矛盾的光辉思想，很快地提高了他们的思想认识。
    这个问题解决后，他们立即开办毛泽东思想学习班，组织无产阶级革命派战士和犯了错误甚至严重错误的人一起学习。在学习班中，大家以毛主席的指示为武器，帮助犯错误的同志分析犯错误的原因，这样做收到了很好的效果。他们深有体会地说：“毛泽东思想学得好不好，用得活不活，就看在错综复杂的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争中，立场站得稳不稳，大是大非分得清不清，如果立场错了，就全错了。”有些人提高了认识之后，揭发了党内一小撮走资派和反革命两面派妄图推翻新生革命政权的种种罪行。这样，就团结了大多数群众，孤立了一小撮阶级敌人。
    在阶级斗争中进行领导班子的革命化建设
    这一场斗争，教育了群众，提高了革命师生的阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟，极大地促进了各级革命委员会的革命化建设。他们认识到，狠抓阶级斗争，发动群众深入开展革命大批判，不停顿地向阶级敌人进攻，这是领导班子革命化建设的根本途径。他们说：“这样做，我们就主动，就朝气蓬勃，就密切联系群众。”
    革命委员会密切联系群众，最重要的是用战无不胜的毛泽东思想去武装群众，带领群众对阶级敌人进行战斗，把群众的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟提得高高的。这样，革命委员会就从根本上代表了广大革命群众的利益。
    在这一场惊心动魄的阶级斗争中，这个学校的各级革命委员会领导成员始终和群众战斗在一起。他们虚心地向群众学习，虚心地听取群众的意见和批评，及时地发现问题，解决问题。有的领导成员还和群众一起开展“一帮一，一对红”活动，一道斗私批修，促进思想革命化，建立了深厚的革命友谊。大家称赞他们“既是群众的小学生，又是冲锋陷阵的带头人”。一些经过斗争考验的优秀共产党员，被吸收到各级革命委员会中。一批无产阶级革命派的骨干力量，也在群众运动中逐步形成。这样就进一步巩固了革命委员会，密切了同群众的联系。
    现在，同济大学革命大批判的烈火燃遍每一个角落，毛泽东思想学习班遍布全校，“无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线”的活动广泛深入地开展起来。革命师生们决心全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，认真学习“无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部”门合同志的光辉事迹，发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，乘胜前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
