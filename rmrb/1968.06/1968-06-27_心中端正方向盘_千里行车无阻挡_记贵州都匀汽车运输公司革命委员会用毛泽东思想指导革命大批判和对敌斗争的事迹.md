The revolutionary committee of the Duyun Automobile Transport Company in Guizhou Province, with unwavering loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, resolutely takes the path of emphasizing proletarian politics. They place the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought at the forefront of all work, vigorously carry out the revolutionary criticism, and intensify class struggle, starting from the ideological transformation of people to promote the revolutionization of the enterprise.

Now, the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought shines brightly over the Duyun Automobile Transport Company, making the revolution roar and production flourish. This company has become an advanced collective in the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought in Guizhou Province and a red flag on the transportation frontline of the entire province. Let Mao Zedong Thought occupy all positions on the transportation frontline

The predecessor of the Duyun Automobile Transport Company was the public-private joint venture Guizhou Automobile Fifth Depot. After moving to Duyun in 1957, a large number of demobilized soldiers and children of poor peasants joined, developing it into a socialist enterprise with over a thousand employees. Before the Cultural Revolution, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the Duyun transportation department fiercely opposed Mao Zedong Thought, opposed emphasizing proletarian politics, advocated the theory of "class struggle extinction," and engaged in factionalism and nepotism, pushing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line. A small clique of capitalist-roaders who usurped the leadership positions of this company faithfully carried out the black goods of Chinese Khrushchev. Chinese Khrushchev advocated "exploitation is meritorious," so they forced workers to "learn from capitalists" and relied on capitalists to run the enterprise; Chinese Khrushchev absurdly said "capitalists can also join the party," so they developed a batch of capitalists to join the party, even allowing a so-called "red capitalist" to usurp the position of a party committee member. Under the control of this small clique of class enemies, this company engaged in extensive activities to restore capitalism, making it chaotic and corrupt.

In the fierce struggle of the Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary faction of the Duyun Automobile Transport Company seized the party, government, financial, and cultural powers from the hands of a small clique of class enemies. From the day the revolutionary committee was established, they set a grand goal: to turn the Duyun Automobile Transport Company into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought, letting Mao Zedong Thought occupy all positions on the transportation frontline.

How to turn this enterprise, which was made chaotic and corrupt by the capitalist-roaders, into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought? The revolutionary committee of the company never forgot to emphasize proletarian politics. In the midst of countless tasks, they placed the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought at the forefront of all work, emphasizing "loyalty" and "application," starting from the ideological transformation of people to promote the revolutionization of the enterprise.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes." The revolutionary committee of the company took the task of holding and running Mao Zedong Thought study classes as a key to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. Since last September, they have been running Mao Zedong Thought study classes, having held seventeen sessions so far, with all revolutionary employees of the company participating in at least one study session. In the study classes, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, they used Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Old Three Articles" as a weapon, turning the study classes into a furnace to temper loyalty to Chairman Mao, a classroom to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and a battlefield to criticize and repudiate selfishness and revisionism, and to intensify class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. According to the characteristics of drivers who are on the road all day and have high mobility, they adopted flexible and varied methods to organize study, with study classes held by driving teams, various stations, and driver rest stops. Various types of study classes blossomed everywhere. Drivers deeply felt: "Entering the Mao Zedong Thought study class, using Mao Zedong Thought to hold the steering wheel, shedding the 'selfish' character, the car can carry more and run faster."

The mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the entire company is thriving. Every morning, drivers gather to study Chairman Mao's works for an hour before setting out. They say: "Holding the steering wheel, first straighten the steering wheel in your mind." Drivers on various highways also study Chairman Mao's quotations and sing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations with passengers before driving and during rest stops, insisting on propagating Mao Zedong Thought everywhere. Due to the revolutionary committee's efforts to arm the broad revolutionary masses with Mao Zedong Thought, people's spiritual outlook has been renewed, socialist morale has been greatly promoted, and good deeds have emerged continuously. Fully mobilize the masses to persistently carry out revolutionary criticism

In the past, under the control of a small clique of capitalist-roaders, the company was deeply poisoned by the counter-revolutionary revisionism of Chinese Khrushchev. After the establishment of the revolutionary committee of the company, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "no destruction, no construction," they vigorously carried out revolutionary criticism to thoroughly eliminate the revisionist poison spread by Chinese Khrushchev.

An important experience they gained in carrying out revolutionary criticism is to fully mobilize and rely on the broad revolutionary masses. Initially, some people thought that many workers had low cultural levels and could not write, so revolutionary criticism should be done by those who can write and speak; others thought that to criticize and repudiate the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party, they needed to rely on those who knew more about the capitalist-roaders. Therefore, they selected some so-called "informed" and "literary" people to form a team to carry out revolutionary criticism. As a result, the revolutionary criticism was cold and lifeless. Members of the revolutionary committee realized from practice that the proletarian revolutionary faction is the backbone of the Cultural Revolution, seizing power from a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party must firmly rely on them, and using power well must firmly rely on them. Carrying out revolutionary criticism and struggle against the enemy must also firmly rely on them. If there is any wavering on the issue of relying on whom, it is a wavering of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Only by "firmly relying on the revolutionary leftists" can "the most reactionary rightists be thoroughly isolated in the movement, the middle elements be won over, and the majority be united," and "organize tens of millions of people, mobilize a surging revolutionary army" to accurately and fiercely strike a small clique of class enemies. The revolutionary committee firmly relied on the proletarian revolutionary faction, the broad revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres to carry out revolutionary criticism, and fully played the fighting role of revolutionary mass organizations. The flames of revolutionary criticism burned more fiercely.

They set up revolutionary criticism battlefields everywhere according to the characteristics of the transportation company being dispersed and highly mobile, with production teams and driving teams as the base points. Revolutionary masses linked the actual class struggle of their units, criticized and repudiated the crimes of a small clique of class enemies in writing and speech. They criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of Chinese Khrushchev, hitting the nail on the head. Many revolutionary old workers exposed their wounds from being whipped by capitalists in the old society at the criticism meetings, directly accused the reactionary capitalists of restoring capitalism, and denounced Chinese Khrushchev's fallacy of "exploitation is meritorious." Such criticism meetings not only severely struck a small clique of class enemies but also raised the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad masses of workers.

Since the establishment of the revolutionary committee, they have closely combined the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit with the actual struggle at the moment, repeatedly carried out special criticism of the fallacies of "class struggle extinction," "material incentives," "bonus as the commander," and other black goods peddled by Chinese Khrushchev, as well as the revisionist party-building line and revisionist organizational line. Wherever the poison has not been thoroughly eliminated and there is ideological backsliding, they continue to criticize and repudiate that issue. In the past, the capitalist-roaders of the company implemented more than sixty kinds of bonuses, greatly corrupting the revolutionary will of the workers. After a period of carrying out revolutionary criticism, all bonuses were canceled. However, some people's thoughts were not clear, saying that bonuses could still stimulate "initiative." A small clique of class enemies took the opportunity to stir up trouble, attacking the revolutionary committee for "not caring about the lives of workers." In response to this problem, the revolutionary committee of the company led everyone to deeply carry out criticism under the theme of "What is the purpose of Chinese Khrushchev's black goods of material incentives?" Everyone repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teaching of "political work is the lifeline of all economic work," further recognizing the wolfish ambition of Chinese Khrushchev to restore capitalism. Many revolutionary workers used their personal experiences to angrily expose the evil plot of a small clique of class enemies to seduce and corrupt workers with money, attempting to achieve "peaceful evolution." They resolutely said: "We revolutionary workers want Mao Zedong Thought, not bonuses. We want to learn from Comrade Men He, to be the people's ox for life, to drive the revolutionary car for life!"

Further expose the cover of class struggle

Recently, Chairman Mao pointed out profoundly: "The Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is, in essence, a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under socialist conditions, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its led broad revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." The revolutionary committee of the Duyun Automobile Transport Company, following Chairman Mao's latest instructions, mobilized the masses to further expose the cover of class struggle in the company.

The revolutionary committee of the company, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "not fighting without preparation," did a large amount of in-depth and detailed investigation and research work before the struggle against the enemy began. The military representative in the revolutionary committee followed the driving teams, investigated all stations under the company's jurisdiction on various lines, and individually visited more than seven hundred revolutionary workers, obtaining a large amount of first-hand materials on historical and real class struggle. The revolutionary committee, based on the materials they had, used the method of class analysis to see clearly the criminal facts of the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the company who executed the revisionist organizational line of Chinese Khrushchev, long-term sheltering and promoting the remnants of the Kuomintang and reactionary capitalists.

Based on the in-depth investigation and research, the revolutionary committee of the company held two struggle meetings against the enemy, exposing, criticizing, and struggling against a small clique of class enemies with current destructive crimes, greatly boosting the morale of the proletariat and crushing the arrogance of the class enemies, fully mobilizing the broad revolutionary masses. The revolutionary committee of the company then led the broad revolutionary workers to study Chairman Mao's series of brilliant instructions and policies on the struggle against the enemy, identifying who to rely on, who to unite with, and who to severely strike, strictly distinguishing between the two types of contradictions, accurately and fiercely launching a fierce attack on a small clique of class enemies. They focused on striking the class enemies hiding within the party and usurping leadership positions, severely striking this small clique of dangerous enemies who wave the "red flag" to oppose the red flag.

In the complex class struggle, the broad masses of workers have a higher awareness of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. They say: "With the boundless power of the telescope and microscope of Mao Zedong Thought, any enemy will be exposed!" Due to the revolutionary committee of the company insisting on using Mao Zedong Thought to command everything, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide class struggle, and promoting the ideological transformation of people, the revolutionary and production situation of the entire company is getting better and better, with the transportation plan being completed ahead of schedule every month.

    心中端正方向盘　千里行车无阻挡
    ——记贵州都匀汽车运输公司革命委员会用毛泽东思想指导革命大批判和对敌斗争的事迹
    贵州省黔南布依族苗族自治州都匀汽车运输公司革命委员会，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席、对战无不胜的毛泽东思想、对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的无限忠心，坚决走突出无产阶级政治的道路。他们把活学活用毛泽东思想放在一切工作的首位，狠抓革命的大批判，狠抓阶级斗争，从抓人的思想革命化入手，促进企业的革命化。
    现在，毛泽东思想的阳光，把都匀汽车运输公司照得一片通红，革命搞得轰轰烈烈，生产搞得热气腾腾。这个公司已成为贵州省活学活用毛泽东思想的先进集体、全省交通运输战线上的一面红旗。让毛泽东思想占领运输战线一切阵地
    都匀汽车运输公司的前身是公私合营贵阳汽车五场。一九五七年迁到都匀以后，大批复员军人和贫下中农子弟参加进来，才发展成为有一千多名职工的社会主义企业。文化大革命以前，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在都匀交通运输部门的代理人，疯狂反对毛泽东思想，反对突出无产阶级政治，鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭”论，招降纳叛，结党营私，推行反革命修正主义路线。窃踞在这个公司领导岗位上的一小撮走资派，忠实地推行中国赫鲁晓夫的黑货。中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“剥削有功”，他们便强迫工人“向资本家学习”，依靠资本家办企业；中国赫鲁晓夫胡说“资本家也可以入党”，他们就发展了一批资本家入党，甚至让一个所谓“红色资本家”窃踞了公司党委委员的职务。这个公司在这一小撮阶级敌人的控制下，大搞资本主义复辟活动，弄得乌烟瘴气。
    在无产阶级文化大革命的激烈搏斗中，都匀汽车运输公司的无产阶级革命派，从一小撮阶级敌人手里夺回了公司的党政财文大权。从革命委员会成立的那天起，他们就立下了雄心壮志：把都匀汽车运输公司办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校，让毛泽东思想占领运输战线的一切阵地。
    怎样把这个被走资派搞得乌烟瘴气的企业，办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校呢？公司革委会念念不忘突出无产阶级政治，他们在千头万绪的工作中，把活学活用毛泽东思想放在一切工作的首位，突出一个“忠”字，狠抓一个“用”字，从抓人的思想革命化入手，促进企业的革命化。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”公司革委会把大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班，作为紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席一系列最新指示的关键来抓。从去年九月就开办毛泽东思想学习班，已经连续办了十七期，全公司的革命职工普遍参加了一次以上的学习。他们在学习班里，在毛主席的一系列最新指示的指引下，以毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”为武器，把学习班办成锤炼忠于毛主席的红心的熔炉，办成落实毛主席最新指示的课堂，办成斗私批修、狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的战场。他们根据驾驶员整天出车、流动性大的特点，采取灵活多样的方式组织学习，有行车小队举办的学习班，有各车站、驾驶员食宿站举办的学习班。各种类型的学习班遍地开花。驾驶员们深有体会地说：“进了毛泽东思想学习班，用毛泽东思想掌握方向盘，把‘私’字‘卸’了，车子就能多装快跑。”
    全公司活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动开展得蓬蓬勃勃。每天早上，驾驶员们集中学习一小时毛主席的宝书，然后出车。他们说：“手握方向盘，先要端正头脑里的方向盘。”行驶在各条公路线上的客车驾驶员们也都在开车前、停车休息时，和旅客们一起学习毛主席语录，唱毛主席语录歌，坚持处处宣传毛泽东思想。由于革委会大力用毛泽东思想武装广大革命职工的头脑，人的精神面貌焕然一新，社会主义正气大发扬，好人好事不断涌现。充分发动群众持久地开展革命大批判
    过去，这个公司在一小撮走资派控制下，中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义流毒很深。公司革委会建立以后，遵照毛主席关于“不破不立”的教导，狠抓革命大批判，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫散布的修正主义流毒。
    他们开展革命大批判的一条重要经验，是充分发动和依靠广大革命群众。开初，有人认为，不少工人文化水平不高，不会摇笔杆子，革命大批判要靠能写会说的人搞；还有人认为，要把公司党内一小撮走资派批倒批臭，要靠对走资派的情况了解得多的人。因此，抽调了一些所谓的“知情者”和“会写文章”的人组成一个班子，依靠他们来搞革命大批判。结果，革命大批判搞得冷冷清清。革委会成员从实践中明确地认识到，无产阶级革命派是无产阶级文化大革命的中坚，向党内一小撮走资派夺权要坚决依靠他们，掌好权用好权要坚决依靠他们，开展革命大批判和对敌斗争同样要坚决依靠他们。在依靠谁的问题上产生了动摇，也就是对毛主席无产阶级革命路线的动摇。只有“坚决依靠革命的左派”，“才能够在运动中，彻底孤立最反动的右派，争取中间派，团结大多数”，才能“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军”，稳准狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人。革委会坚决依靠无产阶级革命派、广大革命群众和革命干部开展革命大批判，并且充分发挥了革命群众组织的战斗作用。革命大批判的烈火越烧越旺。
    他们根据运输公司单位分散、流动性大的特点，以生产班组、行车小队为基点，到处摆开了革命大批判的战场。广大革命职工，联系本单位阶级斗争的实际，口诛笔伐，把一小撮阶级敌人的罪行揭深揭透。他们批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义谬论，针针见血，都打在要害上。许多革命老工人在批判会上，袒露出自己在旧社会被资本家用皮鞭抽的伤痕，当面控诉反动资本家复辟资本主义的罪行，痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫“剥削有功”的谬论。这样的批判会，既狠狠打击了一小撮阶级敌人，又提高了广大职工的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。
    革命委员会建立以来，紧密结合本单位的斗批改，结合当前斗争的实际，对中国赫鲁晓夫贩卖的“阶级斗争熄灭”论、“物质刺激”、“奖金挂帅”等谬论，以及修正主义建党路线和修正主义组织路线等黑货，都反复进行了专题批判。哪一方面的流毒没有彻底肃清，思想有反复，就在哪个问题上继续狠批。过去，公司的走资派搞了六十多种名目的奖金，对职工的革命意志起了很大的腐蚀作用。经过前一段开展革命大批判，奖金全部取消了。但是，有个别群众思想不通，说奖金还可以调动“积极性”。一小撮阶级敌人又趁机煽风点火，攻击革命委员会“不关心职工生活”。针对这个问题，公司革委会以“中国赫鲁晓夫搞这一套物质刺激的黑货究竟有什么目的”为题，引导大家深入开展大批判。大家反复学习了毛主席“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导，进一步认清了中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的狼子野心。许多革命工人用亲身经历，愤怒揭发一小撮阶级敌人用金钱引诱和腐蚀工人，企图搞“和平演变”的罪恶阴谋。他们斩钉截铁地说：“我们革命工人要毛泽东思想，不要奖金。我们要向门合同志学习，当一辈子人民的牛，开一辈子革命的车！”进一步揭开阶级斗争的盖子
    毛主席最近极其深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”都匀汽车运输公司革委会，遵照毛主席的最新指示，放手发动群众，进一步揭开公司的阶级斗争盖子。
    公司革委会遵照毛主席“不打无准备之仗”的教导，在对敌斗争开始以前，作了大量深入细致的调查研究工作。革委会中的军队代表跟着行车小队，深入到公司所辖的各条线路上，调查了所有的车站，还个别访问了七百多名革命职工，大量掌握了历史和现实阶级斗争的第一手材料。革委会根据掌握的大量材料，用阶级分析的方法，看清了公司党内一小撮走资派执行中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义组织路线，长期庇护和重用的国民党残渣余孽和反动资本家的罪恶事实。
    公司革委会在深入进行调查研究的基础上，先后举行了两次对敌斗争大会，对一小撮有现行破坏罪行的阶级敌人进行了大揭发、大批判、大斗争，大长无产阶级的志气，大灭了阶级敌人的威风，把广大革命群众充分发动起来了。公司革委会接着因势利导，组织广大革命职工学习毛主席历来关于对敌斗争的一系列光辉指示和方针政策，认准谁是依靠力量，谁是团结对象，谁是应当狠狠打击的阶级敌人，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，稳准狠地向一小撮阶级敌人展开猛烈的进攻。他们把打击的重点放在隐藏在党内和窃取了领导权的阶级敌人身上，狠狠打击这一小撮打着“红旗”反红旗的危险敌人。
    广大职工在复杂的阶级斗争中，活学活用毛泽东思想的自觉性更高。他们说：“用毛泽东思想这威力无穷的望远镜、显微镜一照，任何敌人都得现原形！”
    由于公司的革委会坚持用毛泽东思想统帅一切，用毛泽东思想指导阶级斗争，促进人的思想革命化，全公司革命和生产形势越来越好，运输计划月月提前超额完成。　本报记者
