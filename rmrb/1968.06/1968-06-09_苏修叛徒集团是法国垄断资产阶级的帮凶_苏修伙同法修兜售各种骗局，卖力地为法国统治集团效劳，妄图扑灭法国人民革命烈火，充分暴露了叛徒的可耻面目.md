The great storm of the revolutionary masses sweeping across France has shaken the decaying and declining world capitalist system. The French ruling class, in order to extinguish this revolutionary fire that threatens its reactionary rule, has resorted to violent suppression of the workers' and students' movements in France, while also playing political deception tricks. The Soviet revisionist clique, in collusion with the French revisionist clique, has worked hard for the French ruling class, peddling various frauds, and playing the shameful role of an accomplice to the French monopoly bourgeoisie and a traitor to the French people's revolutionary cause.

French President de Gaulle, on May 30, openly declared that he would take "other measures" against the revolutionary masses and immediately moved troops into the Paris region to threaten the revolutionary masses. The French revolutionary masses, undaunted by force, vowed to respond to counter-revolutionary violence with revolutionary violence. At this time, the Soviet revisionist clique immediately came out to help the French ruling class, urging French workers to engage in "legal struggle" and not to "cause an uproar."

After the French ruling class, in collusion with the French revisionist clique and the yellow union leaders, failed to pull off the "tripartite negotiations" scam, the French ruling class played a new trick, attempting to achieve a piecemeal breakdown and gradual disintegration of the striking workers' ranks through separate negotiations with unions in various industries and regions. The Soviet revisionist clique enthusiastically supported this new conspiracy of the French ruling class. Tass News Agency loudly proclaimed that in some sectors, "negotiations have achieved certain results," the French ruling authorities have made "major concessions" in these "negotiations," and a series of demands from the working people have been "satisfied." They shamelessly urged French workers to "gradually resume" work, attempting to deceive the French working class into abandoning the revolutionary struggle and surrendering to the monopoly bourgeoisie. Tass also praised the treacherous statement issued by the General Confederation of Labor, controlled by the French revisionists, urging workers to "fully resume work." The facts show how eager these traitors are to help the reactionary ruling authorities quickly extinguish the revolutionary flames.

To ease the anger of the French people, the French ruling class played another trick, announcing parliamentary elections in late June. The Soviet revisionist clique immediately responded and took the opportunity to peddle the revisionist trash of "peaceful transition." The Soviet revisionists blathered on about how in France, "the main struggle has now shifted to the preparations for the upcoming National Assembly elections," and the "National Assembly election campaign" that is about to begin is the "top priority" "political issue." The Soviet revisionists also loudly advocated for the "verdict of the voters," vigorously promoting the establishment of a bourgeois government with traitors like Roger through elections in France, supposedly the so-called "People's Alliance Government," and claiming that this is the "only way to satisfy the wishes of the broad mass movement."

Lenin once criticized the "parliamentary fetishists" of the Second International, pointing out: "If the class struggle is confined to parliamentary struggle, or if parliamentary struggle is considered the highest, decisive, and controlling form of struggle over all other forms of struggle, then this is actually going over to the side of the bourgeoisie against the proletariat." These modern "parliamentary fetishists" of the Soviet and French revisionists are precisely such a bunch of traitors who have gone over to the side of the bourgeoisie against the proletariat. The revolutionary workers and students of France have angrily shouted the slogan, "Elections are betrayal," powerfully exposing the ugly faces of these traitorous scoundrels.

The French revisionist clique has exerted all its efforts in this great revolutionary storm in France, playing the role of a despicable lackey of the French monopoly bourgeoisie. The mouthpiece of the Soviet revisionist clique, *Pravda*, published a special editorial on June 5, praising the French revisionist clique. This article shamelessly claimed that the French revisionist clique had shown the "greatest" "prudence" in this mass revolutionary struggle in France, ensuring "model order" in the factories of monopoly capital and "orderly" demonstrations and parades, etc.

The *Pravda* article not only exposed the traitorous face of the French revisionists but also exposed the servile attitude of the Soviet revisionist clique towards the French ruling class. The facts show that the Soviet leadership clique and the French revisionist leadership clique are birds of a feather.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they are destroyed—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when dealing with the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic." No matter how hard the Soviet revisionist clique and other traitorous scoundrels work for the French monopoly bourgeoisie, they will not be able to stop the development of the French people's revolutionary movement, and they will ultimately be crushed by the wheels of the people's revolution.

    苏修叛徒集团是法国垄断资产阶级的帮凶
    苏修伙同法修兜售各种骗局，卖力地为法国统治集团效劳，妄图扑灭法国人民革命烈火，充分暴露了叛徒的可耻面目
    新华社八日讯　席卷全法国的革命群众运动的伟大风暴，震撼着腐朽没落的世界资本主义制度。法国统治集团为了扑灭这场危及它的反动统治的熊熊的革命烈火，在对法国的工人和学生运动采取暴力镇压的同时，还耍了政治欺骗的花招。苏修叛徒集团伙同法修叛徒集团卖力地为法国统治集团效劳，兜售各种骗局，扮演了法国垄断资产阶级的帮凶、法国人民革命事业的叛徒的可耻角色。
    法国总统戴高乐五月三十日发表演说，公然叫嚣要对革命群众采取“其他手段”，并随即把军队调进巴黎地区，威胁革命群众。法国革命群众不畏强暴，表示要以革命的暴力回答反革命的暴力。这时，苏修集团立即出来为法国统治集团帮忙，要法国工人搞“合法斗争”，不要“闹个天翻地覆”。
    法国统治集团伙同法修叛徒集团和黄色工会头目玩弄“三方谈判”的骗局遭到破产以后，法国统治集团又玩弄新的花招，企图通过同各行业、各地区的工会分别进行谈判的办法，实行各个击破，逐步分化瓦解罢工工人的队伍。苏修叛徒集团对此大声叫好，极力为法国统治集团这一新阴谋效劳。塔斯社大肆宣扬什么“在一些部门中”，“谈判在取得某些结果”，法国统治当局在这些“谈判”中作了“重大让步”，“劳动人民的一系列要求”都“得到了满足”，并厚颜无耻地要法国工人“逐渐恢复”工作，企图借此诱骗法国工人阶级放弃革命斗争，向垄断资产阶级屈服。塔斯社还对法修控制的总工会发表的诱骗工人复工的叛卖性声明大加吹捧，要法国工人“完全复工”。事实表明，这伙叛徒是多么迫不及待地要帮助反动统治当局尽快地扑灭革命的火焰。
    法国统治集团为了缓和法国人民的愤怒情绪，还玩弄另一个骗局，宣布在六月下旬进行议会选举。苏修叛徒集团对此立即响应，并借机大肆贩卖“和平过渡”的修正主义破烂货。苏修胡说什么在法国“主要的斗争现在转入即将举行的国民议会选举的筹备工作方面”，即将开始的“国民议会的选举运动”，是“提到首位的”“政治问题”。苏修还大肆鼓吹什么“选民的判决”，极力宣扬在法国通过选举建立有罗歇之流的叛徒工贼参加的改头换面的资产阶级政府，即所谓的“民主联盟人民政府”，并胡说什么这是“满足广泛人民运动愿望的唯一途径”。
    列宁当年在批判第二国际那些“议会迷”时就曾经指出：“如果把阶级斗争局限于议会斗争，或者认为议会斗争是最高的、决定性的、支配着其余一切斗争形式的斗争，那就是实际上转到资产阶级方面去而反对无产阶级。”苏修、法修这些现代“议会迷”们也就是这样一伙转到资产阶级方面去而反对无产阶级的叛徒工贼。法国的革命工人、学生愤怒地喊出了“选举就是背叛”的口号，有力地揭露了这伙叛徒工贼的丑恶嘴脸。
    法修叛徒集团在法国人民这场伟大的革命风暴中替法国垄断资本卖尽力气，扮演了法国垄断资产阶级豢养的下贱走狗的角色。苏修叛徒集团的喉舌《真理报》六月五日特意发表了一篇编辑部文章，对法修集团大加吹捧。这篇文章恬不知耻地说法修集团在法国群众这次革命斗争中“表现了最大的”“慎重”，说法修保证在垄断资本的工厂里“保持着模范的秩序”以及示威游行的“秩序井然”等等。
    《真理报》的文章，不仅不打自招地暴露了法修的工贼面目，也暴露了苏修集团在法国统治集团面前的奴颜婢膝。事实表明，苏修领导集团和法修领导集团是一丘之貉。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”不管苏修集团和其它形形色色的叛徒工贼怎样卖力地为法国垄断资产阶级效劳，但是他们不仅阻挡不了法国人民革命运动的发展，而且终将被人民革命的历史车轮所碾碎。
