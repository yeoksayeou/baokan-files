Wheat harvests across Huabei have seen a significant increase. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, upon reaping a bumper harvest, have not forgotten Chairman Mao, and are enthusiastically selling their surplus grain to the state.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Hefei on the 12th, the 20 million mu of wheat in Anhui Province's Huabei region has been completely harvested. The yield has increased significantly compared to last year, making this one of the best summer grain harvests in recent years. Currently, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are busy threshing while enthusiastically selling new grain to the state.

This year's bumper wheat harvest in Huabei is the result of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production." It is a fruitful achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. During last year's wheat sowing season, the broad masses of peasants in Huabei injected the revolutionary enthusiasm they had gained from the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into the rush to sow. The drought this past winter and spring was relatively severe, and in May, there was a widespread pest outbreak. However, the broad masses of peasants and cadres, embodying the self-reliant revolutionary spirit of Dazhai Brigade, strengthened field management, overcame the drought, and prevented pest damage, ultimately securing a bumper wheat harvest.

In times of plenty, they do not forget the Communist Party, and in times of plenty, they do not forget Chairman Mao. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Huabei region remember Chairman Mao's teaching to "consider the overall situation," correctly handling the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual. As soon as the summer grain came in, they enthusiastically sold good grain to the state. The revolutionary committee of Fengtai Commune in Fuyang Prefecture completed the summer grain procurement task four days ahead of schedule, exceeding the quota by more than 7,000 jin. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Sudian Commune, Lixin County, through studying the heroic deeds of Comrade Men He, with hearts full of loyalty to Chairman Mao, completed the summer grain procurement task three days ahead of schedule, exceeding the quota.

    淮北小麦普遍增产
    广大贫下中农丰收不忘毛主席，踊跃交售公余粮
    据新华社合肥十二日电　安徽省淮北地区两千多万亩小麦已全部收割完毕，产量普遍比去年增长，是近几年夏粮收成较好的一年。目前，广大贫下中农正在一面加紧脱粒，一面踊跃向国家交售新粮。
    今年淮北地区小麦丰收，是广大贫下中农社员和革命干部坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针的结果，是无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果。去年小麦播种时，淮北地区广大社员就把在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的革命干劲，投入到抢种上。去冬今春旱情比较严重，今年五月间又普遍发生了虫灾。但是，广大社员和干部发扬大寨大队自力更生的革命精神，加强田间管理，终于战胜了干旱，防治了虫害，夺得了小麦丰收。
    丰收不忘共产党，丰收不忘毛主席。淮北地区广大贫下中农和革命干部，牢记毛主席要“顾全大局”的教导，正确处理国家、集体和个人三者关系，夏粮刚一下来就踊跃地把好粮交售给国家。阜阳专区凤台县左集公社革命委员会在今年夏粮征购工作中，突出对伟大领袖毛主席的一个“忠”字，坚决执行毛主席“必须把粮食抓紧”的伟大号召，掀起交粮高潮，在四天内超额七千多斤完成了夏粮征购任务。利辛县苏店公社广大贫下中农和革命干部，通过学习门合同志的英雄事迹，怀着无限忠于毛主席的红心，三天就超额完成了夏粮征购任务。
