The "Emergency Powers Act" passed by the West German parliament on May 30 is a counter-revolutionary bill aimed at intensifying the expansion of West German militarism and suppressing the revolutionary struggles of the West German people.

As early as 1960, the West German government, with the encouragement and support of U.S. imperialism, attempted to have the parliament discuss the "Emergency Powers Act." Due to strong opposition from the people, the West German government resorted to tactics, breaking down the "Emergency Powers Act" into smaller parts. Before the Kiesinger government came to power, seven laws that were part of the "Emergency Powers Act" had effectively been passed, including the so-called "Civil Defense Law," "Self-Defense Law," and "Protective Construction Law," which are laws aimed at reviving militarism.

The current "Emergency Powers Act" passed by the West German parliament includes the so-called "Emergency Constitution" (constitutional amendment) and the "Control of Correspondence and Telecommunications Law," among other so-called "individual" emergency laws. The bill stipulates that in the event of "external danger" or "threats," as well as in the event of "danger to the fundamental order of freedom and democracy" or "natural disasters" within the country, the parliament has the right to declare a "state of emergency." In such circumstances, the government has the right to use the military to fight against "armed revolutionary groups," conscript men and women into the military, tap phone calls and intercept mail, restrict freedom of movement, etc. This essentially legalizes the measures for militarist forces to expand military power and for the West German ruling class to suppress the revolutionary struggles of the West German people.

Since the West German government passed the "Emergency Powers Act" last March and submitted it to the West German parliament, the workers, students, and the broad masses of the West German people have risen up in massive struggles, opposing the parliament's passage of the "Emergency Powers Act." As the movements of the people in Western Europe and North America have surged this year, the West German parliament has accelerated the passage of this bill, and the struggles of the West German people have become increasingly intense. The West German ruling class, disregarding the opposition of the broad masses of the West German people, has brazenly passed the "Emergency Powers Act," which will inevitably backfire, preparing the conditions for their own accelerated collapse.

### 镇压西德人民的“紧急状态法”

    镇压西德人民的“紧急状态法”
    西德议会在五月三十日悍然通过的所谓“紧急状态法”，是一个加紧扩张西德军国主义势力、镇压西德人民革命斗争的反革命法案。
    早在一九六○年，西德政府就在美帝国主义的纵容和支持下，要议会讨论“紧急状态法”。由于遭到人民的强烈反对，西德政府就玩弄手腕，将“紧急状态法”化整为零。在现在的基辛格政府上台以前，实际上已经通过了属于“紧急状态法”的组成部分的七项法律，其中包括所谓“平民防御部队法”、“自卫法”、“防护建筑法”等加紧复活军国主义的法律。
    目前西德议会通过的“紧急状态法”，包括所谓“紧急状态宪法”（即宪法修改案）和“对信件邮电通讯的控制法”等所谓“单项”紧急状态法案。法案规定，在出现“外来危险”或“威胁”时，以及在国内出现“危及自由、民主的根本秩序”或“自然灾害”时，议会有权宣布进入“紧急状态”。在这种情况下，政府有权用军队来同“军事武装的革命分子集团战斗”，征召男子和妇女入伍，偷听电话和拆看邮件，限制自由往来等。这实质上是要使军国主义势力扩军备战和西德统治集团镇压西德人民的反革命措施合法化。
    从西德政府在去年三月通过“紧急状态法”并把它提交西德议会以来，西德的工人、学生和广大人民就愤怒地掀起了大规模的斗争，反对议会通过“紧急状态法”。今年随着西欧、北美人民运动的高涨，西德议会加紧步调通过这个法案，西德人民的斗争也越来越激烈。西德统治集团不顾广大西德人民的反对，悍然通过“紧急状态法”，必将搬起石头打自己的脚，为自己的加速崩溃准备条件。
