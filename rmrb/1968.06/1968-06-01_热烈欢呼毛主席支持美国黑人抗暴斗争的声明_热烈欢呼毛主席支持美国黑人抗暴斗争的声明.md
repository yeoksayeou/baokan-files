	Declaration of the Malayan Communist Party in Response to Chairman Mao's Great Call

	April 17, 1968

	The Malayan Communist Party and the people of all nationalities in Malaya heartily cheer the publication of the declaration by Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the world revolution in our time, in support of the American black people's struggle against violence. This is an event of great historical significance in the current struggle of the peoples of all countries for liberation.

	Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest genius and the greatest proletarian revolutionary of our time. He sees the farthest and stands the highest. The April 16 declaration is another classic masterpiece in the treasure house of contemporary Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, and another brilliant example of proletarian internationalism.

	In the declaration, Comrade Mao Zedong provides the most profound and penetrating analysis of the current situation in the United States and internationally, summarizes the experiences of the struggles of the American black people, the American people, and the peoples of various countries, points out the direction forward, and reveals the prospect of victory. This is a great encouragement and powerful impetus to the revolutionary struggles of the American black people, the American people, and the peoples of various countries, and a severe blow to imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries. The revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world will surely usher in a new upsurge.

	Comrade Mao Zedong's declaration is a call to arms for the oppressed peoples and oppressed nations. The Malayan Communist Party and the Malayan people resolutely respond to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao, launch sustained and fierce attacks on the enemy, and support the just struggle of the American black people. We are determined to strengthen our struggle from all aspects, especially armed struggle, until final victory.

	The American black people's struggle against violence will surely win!
	The liberation struggles of the peoples of various countries will surely win!
	Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!
	Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the peoples of the world!

                                    一九六八年四月十七日
    马来亚共产党人和马来亚各族人民热烈欢呼当代世界革命的伟大导师毛泽东同志支持美国黑人抗暴斗争声明的发表。这是当前世界各国人民争取解放的斗争中具有伟大历史意义的事件。
    毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的天才、最伟大的无产阶级革命家。他站得最高，看得最远。四月十六日声明是当代的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想理论宝库中的又一篇经典杰作，是无产阶级国际主义的又一个光辉范例。
    毛泽东同志在声明中最深刻、最精辟地分析了当前的美国形势和国际形势，概括了美国黑人、美国人民和各国人民的斗争经验，指明了前进的方向，揭示了胜利的前景。这对美国黑人、美国人民和各国人民的革命斗争是一个巨大的鼓舞和有力的推动，而对帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派则是一个极其沉重的打击。世界人民的革命斗争必将因而出现一个新的高涨。
    毛泽东同志的声明是对被压迫人民、被压迫民族的战斗动员令。马来亚共产党人和马来亚人民坚决响应伟大统帅毛主席的伟大号召，对敌人发动持久的猛烈的进攻，支援美国黑人的正义斗争。我们决心从各个方面加强斗争，特别是武装斗争，直到最后胜利。
    美国黑人抗暴斗争必胜！
    各国人民解放斗争必胜！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    世界人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志万岁！
