The United Republic of Tanzania was formed by the union of Tanganyika and Zanzibar on April 26, 1964. Tanzania, with its rich history and ancient culture, is located on the eastern coast of Africa, covering an area of 939,700 square kilometers and with a population of over 10 million. The land is fertile and the country is rich in resources. It is famous for being the world's largest producer of sisal and supplies over 80% of the world's cloves.

A Long Tradition of Anti-Imperialist and Anti-Colonial Struggle

In the late 19th century, colonial powers such as Germany and Britain invaded East Africa, occupying Tanganyika and Zanzibar respectively. After Germany's defeat in World War I, British imperialism placed Tanganyika under its colonial rule. However, the people of Tanzania, who love freedom and independence, have never been willing to endure the slavery and oppression of colonialism. In 1905, the people of Tanganyika launched the Maji Maji uprising, shaking the foundations of German colonial rule in East Africa. In recent decades, to break free from British colonialism and achieve national independence, the people of Tanzania have continued their brave and unyielding struggle. In December 1961, Tanganyika won its freedom. In January 1964, the people of Zanzibar launched an armed uprising, overthrowing the feudal dynasty that served as colonialism's proxy. In April of the same year, Tanganyika and Zanzibar declared the establishment of the United Republic.

The United States has long attempted to infiltrate Tanzania, aiming to re-enslave the Tanzanian people. It not only sent spies to infiltrate Tanzania and engage in subversive activities but also supported and directed the white racist regimes of Southern Rhodesia and South Africa, as well as Portuguese colonialists, in their continuous provocations against Tanzania. Facing the threats, sabotage, and subversive plots of the United States and its lackeys, the brave and tenacious people of Tanzania have shown a revolutionary spirit of fearlessness and determination to fight. In November 1964, unprecedentedly strong anti-American demonstrations erupted across Tanzania.

Supporting National Liberation Movements Around the World

The United Republic of Tanzania pursues a policy of peace, neutrality, and non-alignment in its foreign relations, while clearly taking a stand against imperialism and old and new colonialism, and supporting national liberation movements.

The Tanzanian government and people have consistently sympathized with and supported the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation. The official newspaper of the ruling party, the Tanganyika African National Union, the *Nationalist*, has repeatedly published editorials and commentaries condemning American imperialism's aggression against Vietnam. Recently, the Tanganyika African National Union sent a telegram to Chairman Ho Chi Minh, praising the Vietnamese people's heroic struggle.

Last October, President Nyerere, at the Mwanza Conference of the Tanganyika African National Union, reaffirmed Tanzania's continued support for the struggle of the people of Africa's unliberated countries for national liberation. He pointed out that the people under colonial rule in southern Africa have only one choice: "to engage in armed struggle for freedom."

Recently, the Tanzanian government representative at the United Nations General Assembly severely exposed the counter-revolutionary nature of the so-called "Non-Proliferation Treaty" concocted by the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists, and voted against the adoption of this black treaty.

Self-Reliance in Developing the National Economy and Culture

Since gaining independence, Tanzania has made significant achievements in developing its national economy and culture. In June 1966, Tanzania issued its own currency and established its national bank, the Bank of Tanzania. In February 1967, President Nyerere announced the *Arusha Declaration*, which stipulates that self-reliance is the guiding principle for national development. Subsequently, the Tanzanian government nationalized all eight foreign banks in the country (including three British banks and two American banks) and took over eight large flour mills and eight major import-export enterprises.

In January 1967, the Tanzanian government decided to eliminate the influence of colonial culture by using the national language, Swahili, in all official government business.

Friendship and Cooperation Between China and Tanzania Continue to Develop

The people of China and Tanzania have a long-standing traditional friendship. As early as nine hundred years ago, the peoples of the two countries had exchanges. In the long struggle against imperialism and colonialism and for national independence, our two peoples have always supported and inspired each other. After the founding of the People's Republic of China and Tanzania's independence, this precious friendship between our two peoples has further developed on a new basis. The Chinese people actively support the Tanzanian people's struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism, and their efforts to achieve and maintain national independence, as well as their peaceful, neutral, and non-aligned policy and efforts to develop the national economy. The Tanzanian people have also provided great support to the Chinese people in various ways. The Tanzanian government has consistently supported the restoration of China's lawful seat in the United Nations at every session of the United Nations General Assembly and opposed imperialist schemes to create "two Chinas." In recent years, exchanges and economic and cultural cooperation between our two peoples have further developed. In June 1964, a Tanzanian government economic friendship delegation led by the second vice president, Kawawa, visited China, marking a new chapter in the friendly relations between the two countries. The two governments, based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and sincere cooperation, signed an economic and technical cooperation agreement. In February 1965, President Nyerere, carrying the deep affection of the Tanzanian and African peoples, made his first friendly visit to our country and signed the Sino-Tanzanian Friendship Treaty, consolidating and further developing the friendly cooperative relations between the two countries. In June 1965, Premier Zhou Enlai, at the invitation of the Tanzanian government, visited Tanzania on a friendly visit. The two sides issued a joint communiqué, further strengthening the friendship between the two peoples and the friendly cooperative relations between the two countries.

Now, President Nyerere is visiting China again, which will certainly make new contributions to the development of friendship and cooperation between China and Tanzania.

    坦桑尼亚联合共和国
    坦桑尼亚是由坦噶尼喀和桑给巴尔于一九六四年四月二十六日组成的联合共和国。
    具有悠久历史和古老文化的坦桑尼亚位于非洲的东海岸，面积九十三万九千七百多平方公里，人口一千零十余万。坦桑尼亚土地肥沃、物产丰富，著名的西沙尔麻产量占世界第一位，丁香占世界供应量的百分之八十以上。
    具有长期反帝反殖斗争传统
    十九世纪末叶，德国和英国等殖民势力侵入东非，分别侵占了坦噶尼喀和桑给巴尔。第一次世界大战德国战败，英帝国主义又把坦噶尼喀置于它的殖民统治之下。但是，热爱独立和自由的坦桑尼亚人民从来就不甘心忍受殖民主义的奴役和统治。一九○五年，坦噶尼喀人民掀起了大规模的马及马及起义，动摇了德帝国主义在东非的殖民统治。近数十年来，为了摆脱英国殖民主义的枷锁，争取民族独立，坦桑尼亚人民继续进行了前赴后继的英勇斗争。一九六一年十二月，坦噶尼喀赢得了自由。一九六四年一月，桑给巴尔人民又发动武装起义，推翻了殖民主义代理人的封建统治王朝。同年四月，坦噶尼喀和桑给巴尔宣告成立联合共和国。
    美帝国主义一直企图渗入坦桑尼亚，妄想重新奴役坦桑尼亚人民。它不仅派遣特务潜入坦桑尼亚，搞颠覆活动，还支持和指使南罗得西亚、南非的白人种族主义者和葡萄牙殖民主义者向坦桑尼亚不断进行挑衅。面对美帝国主义和它的娄罗们的威胁、破坏和颠覆阴谋，英勇顽强的坦桑尼亚人民表现了不畏强暴、敢于斗争的革命气概。一九六四年十一月在坦桑尼亚全国各地曾爆发了空前强烈的反美大示威。
    支持各国民族解放运动
    坦桑尼亚联合共和国奉行和平中立和不结盟的外交政策，同时明确地采取反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义、支持民族解放运动的立场。
    坦桑尼亚政府和人民一贯同情和支持越南人民抗美救国的斗争。坦桑尼亚执政党坦噶尼喀非洲民族联盟机关报《民族主义者报》曾多次发表社论和评论，谴责美帝国主义对越南的侵略罪行。最近，坦噶尼喀非洲民族联盟又打电报给胡志明主席，赞扬越南人民的英勇斗争。
    去年十月，尼雷尔总统在坦噶尼喀非洲民族联盟姆万扎会议上重申，坦桑尼亚继续支持非洲未独立国家的人民争取民族解放斗争的立场。他指出，在殖民制度统治下的非洲南部人民，唯一可以选择的道路，是“进行暴力斗争，争取自由”。
    最近，坦桑尼亚政府代表在联合国大会上严厉揭露了美帝、苏修合伙炮制的所谓“防止核扩散”条约的反革命本质，并投票反对通过这个黑条约。
    自力更生发展民族经济文化
    坦桑尼亚独立后，在发展民族经济和文化方面，几年来已取得了显著的成就。一九六六年六月，坦桑尼亚发行了本国货币和成立了自己的国家银行——坦桑尼亚银行。一九六七年二月，尼雷尔总统宣布了《阿鲁沙宣言》，这个宣言规定自力更生政策是国家发展的指导方针。接着，坦桑尼亚政府宣布把在坦桑尼亚的全部八家外国银行（包括三家英国银行和两家美国银行）收归国有，并对八家大面粉厂和八个进出口的大企业实行国有化。
    一九六七年一月，坦桑尼亚政府为清除殖民主义文化的影响，还决定在一切政府部门的公务中，使用本国的民族语言——斯瓦希利语。
    中坦两国友好合作不断发展
    中国人民和坦桑尼亚人民有着悠久的传统友谊。早在九百年以前，中、坦两国人民就有了交往。在反对帝国主义和殖民主义、争取民族独立的长期斗争中，我们两国人民一向是互相支持、互相鼓舞的。在中华人民共和国成立和坦桑尼亚获得独立以后，我们两国人民之间的这种珍贵的友谊，又在新的基础上进一步发展起来。中国人民积极支持坦桑尼亚人民反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义、争取和维护民族独立的斗争，支持坦桑尼亚的和平中立和不结盟政策以及发展国民经济的努力。坦桑尼亚人民也从各方面给予了中国人民以巨大的支援。坦桑尼亚政府在历届联合国大会上都支持恢复中国在联合国的合法席位，并反对帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋。近几年来，我们两国人民的友好往来和经济、文化交流更有了新的发展。一九六四年六月，由第二副总统卡瓦瓦率领的坦桑尼亚政府友好经济代表团来中国访问写下了两国友好关系史上新的一页，两国政府本着平等互利、真诚合作的精神，签订了经济技术合作协定。一九六五年二月，尼雷尔总统带着坦桑尼亚和非洲人民的深情厚谊，首次来我国进行友好访问，并签订了中国和坦桑尼亚友好条约，巩固和进一步发展了两国之间的友好合作关系。一九六五年六月，周恩来总理应邀到坦桑尼亚进行友好访问，双方发表了联合公报，两国人民的友谊和两国之间的友好合作关系得到进一步加强。
    现在，尼雷尔总统又一次来中国访问，必将为中坦两国友谊和合作的发展作出新的贡献。（新华社）
