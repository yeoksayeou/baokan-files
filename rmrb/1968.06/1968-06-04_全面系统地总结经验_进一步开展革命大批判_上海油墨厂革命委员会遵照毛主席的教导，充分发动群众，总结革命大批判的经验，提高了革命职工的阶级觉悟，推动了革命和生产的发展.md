In the face of the imminent complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the increasingly sharp and complex class struggle, how can the revolutionary criticism be carried out more extensively, deeply, persistently, and solidly? The Revolutionary Committee of Shanghai Ink Factory, following the teachings of Chairman Mao on "human beings must constantly summarize experience, make discoveries, inventions, and creations, and make progress," mobilized the masses to thoroughly and systematically summarize the experience of revolutionary criticism over the past year, raising the level of revolutionary criticism to a new height.

Not long ago, while studying and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the factory launched a mass campaign to summarize experiences. Members of the Revolutionary Committee and revolutionary masses together reviewed the year-long process of revolutionary criticism, widely solicited opinions and criticisms from the masses, and then consolidated and analyzed these opinions. Thus, the Revolutionary Committee gained a clear understanding of past achievements, the current situation, and future tasks.

In the process of summarizing experiences, the broad revolutionary masses clearly saw the immense power of revolutionary criticism. Over the past year, all revolutionary workers in the factory resolutely carried out the battle orders of the Proletarian Headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, harboring deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev, and launched sustained attacks on the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. With only five or six hundred revolutionary workers, the factory wrote over 1.5 million words of critical articles and held dozens of special columns for criticism. They used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fiercely criticize the series of revisionist fallacies, such as the "extinction of class struggle" theory, the "exploitation is beneficial" theory, and the "tame tool" theory, which the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party vigorously advocated. They also criticized the entire set of revisionist enterprise management lines they promoted. Revolutionary workers closely linked revolutionary criticism with the actual class struggle in their unit and the struggle-criticism-transformation, achieving remarkable results in realizing the thought revolution of the people, the revolutionization of enterprise management, streamlining the bureaucracy, improving the relationship between cadres and the masses, and promoting production.

Summarizing the experience of carrying out revolutionary criticism further enhanced the revolutionary workers' class struggle consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness. During the process of summarizing experiences, the broad revolutionary masses seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the broad revolutionary masses led by it and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." They more deeply understood that revolutionary criticism is an important form of struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Over the past two years, although the enemies of the proletariat have suffered heavy blows, they are not willing to accept their defeat. They will definitely use more concealed, more treacherous, and more cunning methods to interfere with the revolutionary struggle, shake the proletarian revolutionary regime, and sow discord within the revolutionary ranks. Especially at present, this handful of enemies are frantically looking for agents within the revolutionary ranks, engaging in splittist activities, confusing class lines, and spreading a rightist reversal wind, attempting to achieve their plot to overthrow the proletarian dictatorship and restore capitalism. Therefore, revolutionary criticism must not be relaxed for a moment; it must grasp the enemy's vital points and fight and criticize them fiercely. Workers deeply felt that whether or not there is the determination to carry out revolutionary criticism deeply and persistently and to carry it through to the end is a major issue of whether this political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes can be carried through to the end.

The mass summary also effectively removed some ideological obstacles within the revolutionary ranks that hindered the deep and persistent development of revolutionary criticism. Since last year, due to some achievements and experiences gained from revolutionary criticism, many units came to learn from this factory. Therefore, some people developed a sense of complacency, believing that revolutionary criticism had been done well enough. Through the summary, they realized that carrying out revolutionary criticism is a long-term and arduous task. One cannot become proud, complacent, and slack off just because some achievements have been made and relax the struggle against the enemy. From the perspective of the entire factory, the breadth and depth of revolutionary criticism are still uneven, and some departments are not active enough. The leadership of the factory Revolutionary Committee over class struggle also has some shortcomings that need to be improved.

This time, Shanghai Ink Factory mobilized the masses to summarize the experience of revolutionary criticism, which played a good role in mobilizing the masses to continue to advance and carry the revolution through to the end. Many revolutionary workers, through the summary, with more enthusiastic political passion, greater revolutionary enthusiasm, and more conscious participation, threw themselves into the struggle of revolutionary criticism. The mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought became more extensive and profound, and Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions were quickly implemented. The Revolutionary Committee was also continuously consolidated and developed in the struggle. The ink produced by this factory for printing Chairman Mao's works saw a steady increase in production and continuous improvement in quality. The revolution, production, and all other work in the factory were developing vigorously.

    全面系统地总结经验　进一步开展革命大批判
    上海油墨厂革命委员会遵照毛主席的教导，充分发动群众，总结革命大批判的经验，提高了革命职工的阶级觉悟，推动了革命和生产的发展
    本报讯　在无产阶级文化大革命接近全面胜利的今天，在阶级斗争更加尖锐复杂的情况下，怎样把革命大批判进一步广泛、深入、持久、扎实地开展下去？上海油墨厂革命委员会遵照毛主席关于“人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进”的教导，放手发动群众，对一年多来的革命大批判进行了一次全面的、系统的总结，把革命大批判提高到一个新的水平。
    不久以前，这个厂在学习和落实毛主席最新指示的同时，开展群众性的总结经验的活动。革委会成员和革命群众一起回顾一年多来革命大批判的战斗过程，广泛听取群众的意见和批评，然后再把群众的意见集中起来，加以综合分析。这样，革命委员会对过去的成绩、当前的形势和今后的任务，都做到了胸中有数。
    在总结经验中，广大革命职工清楚地看到了革命大批判所显示的巨大威力。一年多来，全厂革命职工坚决执行以毛主席为首、林彪副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，怀着对中国赫鲁晓夫的深仇大恨，以班组为单位，持续地向党内一小撮最大的走资派发动猛烈进攻。全厂只有五六百名革命职工，前后共写了一百五十多万字的批判文章，连续举办了几十期大批判专栏。他们以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派所竭力鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭”论、“剥削有功”论、“驯服工具”论等一系列修正主义谬论，以及他们所推行的一整套修正主义的企业管理路线。革命职工把革命大批判同本单位的阶级斗争实际、本单位的斗批改紧密结合起来，在实现人的思想革命化，企业管理革命化，精兵简政，改善干群关系，促进生产等方面，都取得了显著的成绩。
    总结开展革命大批判的经验，进一步提高了革命职工的阶级斗争觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟。广大革命职工在总结经验过程中，认真学习了毛主席的最新指示：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”他们更深刻地认识到，革命大批判就是无产阶级同资产阶级进行斗争的一种重要形式。这两年来，无产阶级的敌人尽管受到了沉重的打击，但他们决不甘心于自己的失败，他们一定会以更加隐蔽、更加阴险、更加狡猾的手法，干扰革命斗争的大方向，动摇无产阶级的革命政权。特别是在当前，这一小撮敌人拚命在革命队伍中寻找代理人，大搞分裂活动，搅乱阶级阵线，大刮右倾翻案妖风，妄图达到他们颠覆无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义的阴谋。因此，革命大批判一刻也不能放松，要抓住敌人的要害狠狠斗，狠狠批。职工们深深体会到，有没有决心深入持久地开展革命大批判，把革命大批判进行到底，这是能不能把这场无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命进行到底的大问题。
    群众性的总结，还有效地扫除了革命队伍内部的一些影响革命大批判深入持久开展的思想障碍。这个厂从去年以来，由于革命大批判取得了一些成绩，积累了一些经验，不少单位前来学习。因此，有人就产生了自满情绪，认为革命大批判搞得已经差不多了。通过总结，他们认识到，开展革命大批判是一个长期的艰巨的战斗任务，决不能因为有了成绩，就骄傲、麻痹和懈怠起来，放松对敌斗争。从全厂来看，革命大批判开展的广度和深度，还不平衡，个别部门还动得不够。厂革委会对阶级斗争的领导，也存在着一些缺点，需要改进。
    上海油墨厂这次发动群众总结革命大批判的经验，对发动群众继续乘胜前进，把革命进行到底，起了很好的推动作用。许多革命职工通过总结，以更饱满的政治热情、更大的革命干劲，更自觉地投入革命大批判的斗争。全厂活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动更加广泛和深入，毛主席的一系列最新指示很快得到落实，革命委员会也在斗争中不断得到巩固和发展。这个厂所生产的印刷毛主席著作用的油墨，产量稳步上升，质量不断提高。全厂革命、生产和各项工作都在蓬蓬勃勃地发展。
