The people of all ethnic groups in Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Guangdong Province, with the enthusiastic help of the People's Liberation Army, have raised high the revolutionary banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against the reactionaries," closely followed the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, and launched a sustained and fierce attack on the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, including China's Khrushchev, and their agents in this region. They have thoroughly smashed their evil plot to restore capitalism in the Wuzhishan area and achieved decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Over the past two years of proletarian political revolution against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, the spiritual face of the revolutionary people of the Li, Miao, Hui, and Han ethnic groups in the Wuzhishan area has undergone a thorough change. The theory, line, principles, and policies of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat proposed by Chairman Mao have deeply entered the hearts of the people. The invincible thought of Mao Zedong has been widely popularized to an unprecedented extent. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the class struggle consciousness and awareness of the two-line struggle of the revolutionary people of all ethnic groups have greatly increased. Revolutionary committees in Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture and its subordinate counties have been successively born in victory. The newly born revolutionary committees are increasingly showing great revolutionary power.

The people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous prefecture, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, follow Chairman Mao's teachings on "breaking first and establishing in the process" and have launched a revolutionary criticism of China's Khrushchev and his agents in this region. The revolutionary people of all ethnic groups regard active participation in the revolutionary criticism as the most practical revolutionary action to defend Chairman Mao, defend the thought of Mao Zedong, and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They combine the actual class struggle in their local area to severely criticize the reactionary fallacies advocated by China's Khrushchev, such as the theory of "extinguishing class struggle."

The ship of revolution relies on the helmsman, and the revolution relies on the thought of Mao Zedong. The revolutionary criticism has promoted the widespread popularization of the thought of Mao Zedong. Over the past two years, the revolutionary masses of all ethnic groups in Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture have generally adopted the method of learning one quotation from Chairman Mao, criticizing one reactionary viewpoint of China's Khrushchev, and eliminating one aspect of revisionist poison. They closely combine the actual class struggle, actively learn and apply the thought of Mao Zedong, and achieve immediate effects. The great leader Chairman Mao issued the battle call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," and they responded immediately. They set up various types of Mao Zedong thought study classes, from deep mountains and old forests to villages, fields, and poor peasant families, everywhere has become a classroom to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and carry out the struggle against selfishness and revisionism. Now, more than 3,000 study classes have been set up in the entire autonomous prefecture, with more than 300,000 people participating in the study. The Mao Zedong thought study classes held in various places have effectively developed and consolidated the great alliance of revolution and the three-in-one combination of revolution.

Many Li people who have lived in the deep mountains and old forests for many years were exploited and oppressed in the old society, had no opportunity to learn culture, used ropes to record events, and carved wood to record years and months. Some of them could not even remember their own age. Now, many elderly people can recite a few to several dozen quotations from Chairman Mao, and some can even recite the "Three Articles" and the important instructions given by Chairman Mao during his inspections of North China, Central South, and East China. They learn a little and use it a little, and follow Chairman Mao's words to the letter. Every household in the Li villages and Miao hamlets has a portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, and the red sun shines forever over the Wuzhishan. They say, "With Chairman Mao, we have everything."

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power. The counter-revolutionaries fight to the death with the revolutionary forces, also completely for the purpose of maintaining their power." The revolutionary people of all ethnic groups are all concerned with the great issue of consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and actively participate in the dictatorship over the class enemies.

The victorious practice of class struggle has enabled the revolutionary cadres and the revolutionary people of all ethnic groups to further grasp the great truth pointed out by the great leader Chairman Mao: "Without extensive people's democracy, the dictatorship of the proletariat cannot be consolidated, and the power will be unstable." They say: As long as the masses are fully mobilized, any sabotage and disruption by the class enemies will not escape the punishment of history.

    毛泽东思想在海南黎族苗族自治州大普及
    五指山区各族人民精神面貌焕然一新
    据新华社广州五日电　广东省海南黎族苗族自治州各族广大革命群众，在人民解放军的热情帮助下，高举“对反动派造反有理”的革命大旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，对中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派及其在本地区的代理人，展开持久猛烈的进攻，彻底粉碎了他们妄图在五指山区复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋，取得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性的胜利。
    经过两年来的无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，五指山区黎、苗、回、汉各族革命人民的精神面貌发生了翻天覆地的变化。毛主席提出的无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，深入人心，战无不胜的毛泽东思想得到了空前的大普及。在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，各族革命人民的阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高。海南黎族苗族自治州以及所属各县的革命委员会都先后胜利诞生。新生的革命委员会越来越显示出巨大革命威力。
    无限忠于毛主席的自治州各族革命人民，遵照毛主席关于破字当头，立在其中的教导，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本地区代理人展开了革命大批判。各族革命人民把积极参加革命大批判，看作是保卫毛主席、保卫毛泽东思想、保卫毛主席革命路线的最实际的革命行动。他们结合当地阶级斗争实际，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭”论等反动谬论。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。革命的大批判，促进了毛泽东思想的大普及。两年来，海南黎族苗族自治州的各族革命群众，普遍采用学习一条毛主席语录，批判中国赫鲁晓夫一个反动观点，肃清一个方面修正主义流毒的方法，紧密结合阶级斗争实际，活学活用毛泽东思想，取得了立竿见影的效果。伟大领袖毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的战斗号召，他们闻风而动，大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，从深山老林里的村寨、田头到贫下中农家庭，处处都成了落实毛主席最新指示、开展斗私批修的课堂。现在全自治州已办学习班三千多期，三十多万人参加了学习。各地举办的毛泽东思想学习班，有力地发展和巩固了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。
    许多长年居住在深山老林里的黎族人民，在旧社会受剥削压迫，没有机会学文化，靠结绳记事，刻木记年月，有的连自己多少岁数也记不清。现在许多老年人也能背诵几条到几十条毛主席语录，有的还能背诵“老三篇”和毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区时的重要指示。他们学一点用一点，毛主席的话句句照办。黎村苗寨家家户户都有伟大领袖毛主席画像，红太阳永远高照五指山。他们说，有了毛主席，才有我们的一切。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”各族广大革命群众，都在关心巩固无产阶级政权的大问题，积极参加对阶级敌人的专政。
    阶级斗争的胜利实践，使广大革命干部和各族革命群众进一步掌握了伟大领袖毛主席指出的“没有广泛的人民民主，无产阶级专政不能巩固，政权会不稳”这一伟大真理。他们说：只要把群众充分发动起来，任何阶级敌人的破坏和捣乱，都逃不脱历史的惩罚。
