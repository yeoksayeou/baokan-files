The U.S. and Soviet revisionists have struck another black deal, exchanging ratification documents for their consular treaty, which opens wide the door for U.S. infiltration into the Soviet Union. Johnson advocates U.S.-Soviet "parallel progress," while the Soviet revisionist ambassador beseeches the U.S. for "cooperation."

BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) — WASHINGTON — After the U.S. and Soviet revisionists forced through a so-called "non-proliferation treaty" at the United Nations on June 12, they immediately exchanged ratification documents for their consular treaty on June 13. This once again shows that, in the face of the current favorable revolutionary situation and increasing difficulties for the U.S. and Soviet revisionists, they have accelerated their counter-revolutionary collusion. The Soviet revisionist leadership is even more brazenly pursuing a policy of betrayal and capitulation.

The U.S. has long demanded a consular treaty with the Soviet revisionist authorities to facilitate "peaceful infiltration" and accelerate the "peaceful evolution" of the Soviet Union. This suits the needs of the Soviet revisionist clique for a full-scale restoration of capitalism. According to the treaty, both sides can establish consulates in certain cities of the other. If one country arrests any "citizen" of the other, it must notify the other government within three days, and consular officials of the other side can meet the arrested person within four days. This opens wide the door for U.S. agents, spies, and the like to pour into the Soviet Union for conspiratorial activities.

The ceremony for exchanging the treaty ratification documents was held in the lair of the U.S. head, Johnson—the White House. Johnson personally attended the ceremony. He, along with Rusk and Dobrynin, who represented the Soviet authorities, all praised and cheered for this new collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union at the ceremony. They unanimously expressed that both sides would continue to tighten their collusion and make more deals.

Johnson repeatedly praised the Soviet revisionists' betrayal and capitulation, saying that the U.S.-Soviet consular treaty is "the first bilateral treaty between the Soviet Union and the United States." He boasted that this treaty is "historic" and will "promote and encourage normal contacts between the two countries and their citizens." However, the focus of his speech was to emphasize future rapid and extensive collusion with the Soviet revisionists. He expressed his hope that the U.S.-Soviet consular treaty "will be a signal for the future," and from now on, the U.S. and the Soviet Union can strengthen "cooperation" in "disarmament" and "an increasingly broad political sphere." He repeatedly stressed that "differences" between the United States and the Soviet Union must be eliminated, and he openly advocated: "In areas where our vital interests permit, we must move forward in parallel," and "in any place and at any time where we can cooperate, we must cooperate."

Rusk also spoke in a self-satisfied tone, saying that this treaty will "greatly promote" collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, which makes him "very satisfied." He actually admitted that making such a treaty is beneficial for the U.S. to carry out "peaceful infiltration" of the Soviet Union. He mentioned that about 20,000 Americans "visit" the Soviet Union every year, so he emphasized: "The significance of this treaty is greater than most people realize."

Dobrynin, in his speech, obsequiously followed Johnson's tune to advocate tightening U.S.-Soviet collusion. He unabashedly said that the United States and the Soviet Union should "cooperate in many fields. The consular treaty is a step in the right direction." His speech was quite satisfying to the American monopoly capitalist class. The Associated Press in the U.S. praised Dobrynin's speech as having an "attention-grabbing positive tone," which "unexpectedly gave hope," and "this indicates that the Soviet Union is willing to reach new bilateral or multilateral agreements with the United States."

On the same day the U.S. and the Soviet Union exchanged consular treaty ratification documents, U.S. State Department Special Assistant Lindley revealed in a speech that the U.S. and the Soviet Union are currently intensifying new deals in many areas. He mentioned that both sides are currently "attempting to agree on a further exchange in the fields of culture, science, technology, and education," and that the Moscow-New York route "may soon open." In addition, he hinted that both sides are also brewing "serious negotiations" on the so-called "limitation and reduction of strategic weapons." He inadvertently revealed the Soviet revisionist leadership's evil face of fake support and real betrayal on the Vietnam issue, pointing out that all this shows that, despite the Vietnam War, this has not hindered the development of a "constructive trend" of "U.S.-Soviet cooperation."

In Bonn, West Germany, demonstrators wave red flags and participate in a protest rally against the "emergency law" that accelerates West Germany's fascization.

In the suburbs of Paris, the capital of France, workers at the Renault factory go on strike and occupy the factory. This is a gathering of striking workers inside the factory.

    美帝苏修又做一笔黑交易
    交换两国领事条约批准书为美帝渗入苏联大开方便之门
    约翰逊鼓吹美苏“并行前进”　苏修大使恳求美帝“合作”
    新华社十四日讯　华盛顿消息：美帝苏修在十二日操纵联合国大会强行通过它们合伙炮制的所谓“防止核扩散”条约之后，紧接着，又在十三日交换了它们签订领事条约的批准书。这再次表明，在当前世界革命形势大好，美帝苏修日子越来越不好过的情况下，它们大大加快了反革命勾结的步伐；苏修领导集团正在更加露骨地奉行叛卖、投降政策。
    美帝早就要求同苏修当局签订一个所谓领事条约，以便更加方便地对苏联进行“和平渗透”，加速苏联的“和平演变”；而这正适合了苏修集团全面复辟资本主义的需要。根据这个条约，双方可以在对方的某些城市互设领事馆；一国在拘捕对方的任何“公民”后，应在三天之内通知对方政府，而对方领事馆的官员就能在四天之内会见这个被捕的人。这就为美帝的特务、间谍等大举涌入苏联进行阴谋活动大开方便之门。
    交换条约批准书的仪式，是在美帝头子约翰逊的老巢——白宫里举行的。约翰逊亲自出席了仪式。他和腊斯克以及代表苏修当局出席仪式的苏联驻美国大使多勃雷宁都在仪式上为美苏间的这一新的勾结吹嘘、叫好，并且异口同声地表示，双方还要继续加紧勾结，作成更多的交易。
    约翰逊在讲话中一再赞扬苏修的叛卖、投降行径，他说，美苏领事条约“是苏联和美国之间签订的第一个双边条约”。他吹捧这个条约是“具有历史意义的”，它将“促进和鼓励两国之间和两国公民之间的正常接触”。但是，他讲话的重点是强调今后要同苏修进行更迅速、更广泛的勾结。他表示希望，美苏领事条约“将是一个对未来的信号”，从此以后，美苏可以在“裁军”以及“日益扩大的政治方面”加强“合作”。他反复强调，必须消除美国和苏联之间的“分歧”，并且公开鼓吹：“在我们的切身利益许可的方面，我们必须并行前进”，“在我们能够合作的任何地方和任何时候，我们必须合作”。
    腊斯克也用一种心满意足的口吻谈到，这个条约将“大大促进”美苏之间的勾结，这使他“非常满意”。他实际上承认，搞这样一个条约是有利于美国对苏联进行“和平渗透”的。他谈到，每年大约有两万名美国人“访问”苏联，因此，他强调：“这个条约的意义比大多数人所认识的还要重大”。
    多勃雷宁在讲话中，奴颜卑膝地照着约翰逊的调子鼓吹加紧美苏勾结。他毫不掩饰地说，美国和苏联应当“在许多领域内合作。领事条约就是迈向正确方向的一个步骤”。他的讲话颇使美国垄断资产阶级感到满意，美国合众国际社在消息中夸奖多勃雷宁的讲话的“调子引人注意地积极”，“出人意外地使人产生希望”，“这表明，苏联将愿意同美国达成新的双边或多边协议”。
    在美苏交换领事条约批准书的同一天，美国国务卿特别助理林德利在一次讲话中透露，美苏目前正在许多方面加紧酝酿或进行新的交易。他谈到，双方目前“正在企图协议一个关于在文化、科学、技术和教育方面进一步交流”的协定，莫斯科—纽约之间的航线“可望很快开辟”；此外，他还暗示，双方还正在酝酿就所谓“限制和削减战略武器”问题开始“认真的谈判”。他无意中一语道破了苏修领导集团在越南问题上假支持、真出卖的罪恶嘴脸，他指出，这一切都表明，尽管有越南战争，但这并没有妨碍“美苏合作”这样一个“建设性倾向”的发展。（附图片）
