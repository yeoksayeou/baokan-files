The spokesman for the Palestinian nationalist organization "Fatah," Yasir Arafat, recently stated: "Palestine is our land. We will reclaim it. If we cannot reclaim it, our sons will. If our sons cannot, our grandsons will. We will fight on, even if it means fighting to the last person, to reclaim it." He emphasized, "Palestine was taken by force, and it can only be reclaimed by force."

According to the latest issue of the Arabic daily newspaper "The Echo of Struggle" published by "Fatah" here, Arafat made these remarks during an interview with a reporter from the Beirut newspaper "Today" at a "Fatah" camp.

Arafat also said, "We are no longer refugees on our own land. We are revolutionaries fighting to liberate our homeland."

Regarding the activities of the UN "envoy" Gunnar Jarring in seeking a "political solution" in the Middle East, Arafat said, "Whoever agrees to so-called peace (to solve the Middle East problem) is their own business. As for the Palestinians, they have made up their minds. They have started a real war."

Arafat said that even if someone agrees with Jarring's views and reaches a settlement with him, "we are not bound by these resolutions." He stressed, "We have fought, we are fighting, and we will continue to fight until we achieve victory."

Arafat also said, "The rulers can maintain their treaties, but the people will protect us. We rely on the Arab people."

    “法塔赫”发言人谴责联合国在中东搞“政治解决”的阴谋
    巴勒斯坦人民决心收复失地战斗到最后胜利
    据新华社大马士革电  巴勒斯坦民族主义组织“法塔赫”发言人亚西尔·阿拉法特最近说：“巴勒斯坦是我们的土地。我们要收复它。如果我们不能收复，我们的儿子将收复，如果我们的儿子不能收复，我们的孙子将收复。我们将战斗下去，即使打到最后一个人，也要收复它。”他强调说：“巴勒斯坦是被人用武力夺走的，因此只能用武力来收复。”
    据“法塔赫”最近在这里发行的阿拉伯文每日新闻《战斗的反响》报道：阿拉法特是在“法塔赫”的一个营地接见贝鲁特《今天报》记者时讲这番话的。
    阿拉法特还说：“我们不再是自己土地上的难民了，我们是为了解放自己国土而斗争的革命者。”
    在谈到关于联合国“特使”雅林在中东搞“政治解决”的阴谋活动时，阿拉法特说：“谁同意所谓和平（解决中东问题），那只是他们自己的事。至于巴勒斯坦人，他们已下定决心。他们开始了真正的战争。”
    阿拉法特说，即使有人同意雅林的意见而同他达成一项解决办法，“我们依旧不受这些决议的约束”。他强调说：“我们进行过战斗，我们正在进行战斗，我们将来还要进行战斗，直到取得胜利。”
    阿拉法特还说：“统治者们可以维护他们的条约，但是人民会保护我们。我们依靠阿拉伯人民。”
