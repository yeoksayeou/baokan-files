The Revolutionary Committee of Meixi District, Yichun City, in the process of deepening the revolutionary criticism, attaches great importance to organizing the members of the Revolutionary Committee and the staff to go to the grassroots level to conduct in-depth investigations into the class struggle situation. After conducting these investigations, these comrades have heightened their awareness of class struggle and line struggle, and have promoted the revolutionary criticism in the leading organs and grassroots units.

After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of Meixi District, it has closely followed the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, actively leading the broad revolutionary masses to launch a revolutionary criticism against the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in this region. However, just as the revolutionary criticism needs to be deepened step by step, some cadres think: We have started the criticism early and it is almost done here. There are also a few comrades who are busy with production and do not pay much attention to the revolutionary criticism. The Revolutionary Committee, based on the above situation, in addition to organizing the members of the Revolutionary Committee and cadres to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's great teachings of "never forget class struggle" and "our important task on the ideological front now is to carry out a criticism of revisionism," also follows Chairman Mao's great teaching of "all practical workers must go down to conduct investigations." The Revolutionary Committee organized the members of the Revolutionary Committee and the staff to go to the grassroots level in a systematic and industry-specific manner to conduct class surveys. They also proposed: Investigate what you do; criticize the revisionist black goods that Chinese Khrushchev promotes in this regard.

After arriving at the grassroots level, the members of the Revolutionary Committee and the cadres personally heard the broad revolutionary masses use living facts to expose the conspiracy of Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the forest area to restore capitalism, and to denounce the harm of Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist enterprise management line and revisionist party-building line to revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses. Through in-depth investigations, the members of the Revolutionary Committee and the cadres learned that a small handful of capitalist roaders have not given up their evil intentions and are still using two-faced tactics to deceive the masses, attempting to reverse the verdict; the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have not been reformed are still trying every means to sabotage the revolution and production, plotting a counterattack. Many living facts made the members of the Revolutionary Committee and the cadres realize: The poisonous roots of the capitalist roaders have not been completely uprooted, and the poison in their own minds has not been completely eliminated. Therefore, they strengthened their awareness of class struggle, broke away from the "almost done" mentality, and further grasped the revolutionary criticism.

Through investigating the class struggle situation, the members of the Revolutionary Committee and the cadres specifically grasped a large number of counter-revolutionary crimes committed by the capitalist roaders, and better promoted the revolutionary criticism in the leading organs. The members of the Production Committee and other departments led by the Revolutionary Committee, after returning from the investigation, led the masses to conduct thematic criticism. They used the "five looks": look at how Chairman Mao taught, look at how Vice Chairman Lin instructed, look at how Chinese Khrushchev poisoned, look at how the capitalist roaders in this region promoted revisionist black goods, and look at how they themselves thought at that time. They also combined this with the work of their own departments, linked it with their own thoughts, and closely combined the criticism of revisionism with the struggle against selfishness. They combined it with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own industry and system. This way, they achieved good results. The members of the Revolutionary Committee and the cadres have tasted the sweetness of in-depth investigations. Now, more than two-thirds of the cadres have gone to the grassroots level to conduct investigations and research, firmly grasp the class struggle, and work with the masses to carry out revolutionary criticism and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

The members of the Revolutionary Committee and the cadres, while conducting investigations, also help the grassroots units to deepen the revolutionary criticism. Through the method of "combining top and bottom," the level of revolutionary criticism is getting higher and higher. When the members of the Revolutionary Committee and the cadres conduct investigations in grassroots units, they criticize with the masses on one hand and help the grassroots units to summarize experiences on the other, so that the revolutionary criticism in the whole district can be carried out continuously and deeply.

    下到基层单位作阶级调查  推动革命大批判深入开展
    据新华社哈尔滨二十一日电　黑龙江省伊春市美溪区革命委员会在深入开展革命大批判中，重视组织革委会成员和机关干部到基层去对阶级斗争状况作深入的调查研究。这些同志在深入基层进行调查以后，提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，推动了领导机关和基层单位的革命大批判。
    美溪区革命委员会成立以后，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，积极带领广大革命群众向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本地区的代理人开展了革命大批判。但是，正当革命大批判需要步步深入时，一些干部认为：我们这里大批判抓得早、批得差不多了。还有个别同志忙于抓生产，对革命大批判不大关心。革命委员会根据上述情况，除组织革委会成员和干部反复学习毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”和“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判”的伟大教导外，还遵照毛主席“一切实际工作者必须向下作调查”的伟大教导，组织革委会成员和机关干部，按系统、分行业到基层去作阶级调查。他们并提出：干什么，调查什么；干什么，就批判中国赫鲁晓夫在这方面推行的修正主义黑货。
    革委会成员和干部到了基层以后，亲耳听到广大革命群众以活生生的事实，揭露了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在林区的代理人妄图复辟资本主义的阴谋，控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义办企业路线和修正主义建党路线对革命干部和革命群众的毒害。通过深入的调查，革委会成员和干部了解到一小撮走资派贼心不死，还在用两面派手法蒙蔽群众，企图翻案；没有改造好的地富反坏右分子，还在千方百计地破坏革命，破坏生产，阴谋反攻倒算。许多活生生的事实，使革委会成员和干部认识到：走资派的毒根还远远没有挖尽，在自己头脑中的流毒也远远没有肃清。因而增强了阶级斗争观念，大破了“差不多”思想，进一步狠抓革命大批判。
    通过对阶级斗争状况的调查，革委会成员和干部具体地掌握了走资派的大量的反革命罪恶事实，更好地推动了领导机关的革命大批判。革委会领导下的生产委员会等部门的领导成员，在调查回来后，领导群众进行专题批判，他们采用“五看”：看毛主席是怎样教导的，看林彪副主席是怎样指示的，看中国赫鲁晓夫是怎样放毒的，看本地区走资派是怎样推行修正主义黑货的，看当时自己是怎样想的。还结合本部门的工作，联系自己的思想，使批修和斗私紧密地结合起来，和本行业本系统的斗、批、改结合起来。他们这样做，收到了很好的效果。革委会成员和干部们已尝到了深入调查的甜头。现在，已有三分之二以上的干部，深入基层，作调查研究，狠抓阶级斗争，和群众一起搞革命大批判，一起落实毛主席的最新指示。
    革委会成员和干部边调查，边帮助基层单位深入开展革命大批判。通过
  “上下结合”的办法，革命大批判的水平越来越高。革委会成员和干部在基层单位进行调查时，一边和群众一起批判，一边帮助基层单位总结经验，使全区革命大批判不断深入持久地开展下去。
