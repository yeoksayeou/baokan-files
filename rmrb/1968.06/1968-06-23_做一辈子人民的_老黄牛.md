To Be a Lifetime Servant of the People as an "Old Yellow Cow"

Xing Yanzi
Youth from Baodi County, Siji Village, Hebei Province

Chairman Mao has repeatedly instructed us: "All our cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people. Everything we do is for the people to serve." "We Communists are not to be officials, but to make revolution." To revolutionize or to serve oneself, to be a servant of the people or to be an official above the masses, these are two completely opposing worldviews. However, China's Khrushchev has been vigorously instilling the extreme individualist idea of "promotion and wealth" into us, the knowledge youth who have gone to the countryside. He blathers on about: "After returning to the countryside, honestly farm for three to five years, and if you meet three conditions (being skilled in farming, having culture, and having good relations with the masses), the masses will elect you as a township cadre, county cadre, provincial cadre, or even to the central government." In one sentence, China's Khrushchev exposes his ugly soul, revealing that he has infiltrated the revolutionary ranks to "become an official"! This is also a great slander against us, the knowledge youth who are full of revolutionary spirit and are building a new socialist countryside!

Over the past ten years, I have followed Chairman Mao's instructions and firmly walked the path of integrating with the workers and peasants. I have dedicated my heart, which is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, to the new socialist countryside. In the storms of class struggle, especially during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I have firmly stood on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, I have launched fierce attacks on the class enemies, defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and raising my class struggle and line struggle consciousness. The poor and lower-middle peasants have elected me as a member and standing committee member of the revolutionary committees at the provincial, municipal, and county levels. This is their greatest trust, greatest expectation, and greatest test of me, and it is also their greatest encouragement for me to better serve the people in the future.

I will never forget that our reddest sun, Chairman Mao, has received me three times. Each time, he instructed me to always integrate with the workers and peasants, to serve the people wholeheartedly, and never to be arrogant. Chairman Mao's affectionate instructions are forever my driving force and guiding principles. I firmly remember Chairman Mao's instructions and strive to ensure that even if my position changes, my thoughts do not change, and I do not lose the essence of the working people or become arrogant. Since becoming a member and standing committee member of the revolutionary committees at various levels, I have attended many meetings, sometimes for several days in a row. However, no matter how many meetings I attend or how tight the schedule is, I always seize every opportunity to labor with the community members and engage in self-criticism and the criticism of revisionism. Where the work is heaviest, I do that; where it is most difficult, I go there. Last winter, to rush the sowing of wheat, the entire village's labor force and livestock were mobilized, and I, together with the community members, pulled the plow to sow. The rope rubbed blisters on my shoulders, and the poor and lower-middle peasants saw this and felt both heartache and joy.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our party and state cadres are ordinary workers, not lords sitting on the heads of the people." China's Khrushchev attempts to make me detach from the masses, pursue personal fame and wealth, and serve him in his attempt to restore capitalism. This is a futile dream! I will forever remember Chairman Mao's instructions, walk the path of integrating with the workers and peasants for a lifetime, and be a lifetime servant of the people as an "old yellow cow"!

    做一辈子人民的“老黄牛”
    河北省宝坻县司家庄大队知识青年  邢燕子
    毛主席他老人家谆谆教导我们：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员，我们所做的一切，都是为人民服务”，“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命”。为革命还是为个人，当人民的勤务员还是高踞于群众之上做官当老爷，这是完全对立的两种世界观。而中国赫鲁晓夫却极力向我们上山下乡知识青年灌输“升官发财”的极端利己主义思想。他胡说什么：“回乡后，老老实实种三五年地，具备三条（种田样样都会，有文化，群众关系好）群众就会选你当乡干部、县干部、省干部，也可以到中央。”一句话暴露了中国赫鲁晓夫的丑恶灵魂，他混入革命队伍原来是为了“做官”！这也是他对我们满怀革命豪情去建设社会主义新农村的知识青年的极大污蔑！
      十年来，我遵照毛主席的教导，坚定地走同工农群众相结合的道路，把一颗无限忠于毛主席的红心献给社会主义新农村。在阶级斗争的风浪里，特别是在无产阶级文化大革命中，我坚定地站在毛主席革命路线一边，和贫下中农一起，向阶级敌人展开猛烈的进攻，捍卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，并提高了自己的阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟。贫下中农把我选为省、地、县等各级革命委员会的委员、常委，这是他们对我的最大信任、最大期望、最大考验，也是他们对我今后更好地为人民服务的最大鞭策。
    我终生难忘的是我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席三次接见了我。每次接见，他老人家都嘱咐我永远同工农群众结合在一块，全心全意为人民服务，千万不可骄傲。毛主席的亲切教导，永远是我前进的动力，行动的指南。我牢记毛主席的教导，努力做到地位变了，思想不能变，劳动人民的本色不丢，尾巴不翘。我从当了各级革命委员会委员、常委以后，开会多了，有时一连就是好几天。但是不论开会怎么多，时间怎么紧，我都抓一切时间同社员一起劳动，一起斗私批修。那项活最重，我就干那项；那里最艰苦，我就到那里去。去年冬天为了抢种小麦，全村劳力和畜力全部出动，我就和社员一起拉耠播种。绳子把我的肩膀磨起了血泡，贫下中农看到了，又心疼又高兴。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者，而不是骑在人民头上的老爷。”中国赫鲁晓夫妄图使我脱离群众，去追求个人的名利地位，为他复辟资本主义效劳，这是痴心妄想！我要永远牢记毛主席的教导，走一辈子同工农相结合的路，做一辈子人民的“老黄牛”！
