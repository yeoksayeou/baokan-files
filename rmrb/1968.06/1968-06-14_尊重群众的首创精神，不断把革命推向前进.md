At a crucial moment when the entire nation, military and civilian alike, is high-spiritedly advancing with the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, seizing victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental distinction between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental distinction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental distinction between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship." The broad ranks of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army fighting on the front lines of "three supports and two military" tasks, with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, have combined their personal experiences with a serious study and resolute implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They have used Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a powerful ideological weapon and as a guiding light for further improving the "three supports and two military" work, determined to do an even better job in "three supports and two military" work.

Below are a few articles written by some soldiers and officers responsible for "three supports and two military" tasks after studying the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions:

Respect the Masses' Initiative and Continuously Advance the Revolution

Shenyang Military Region's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at Shenyang Bearing Factory

At a crucial moment when the entire nation, military and civilian alike, is high-spiritedly advancing with the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, seizing victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental distinction between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental distinction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental distinction between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship." Combining our experiences from over a year of "three supports and two military" work with a study of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we feel particularly close to them. We deeply understand that Chairman Mao's latest instructions most thoroughly elucidate the focal point of the struggle between the two lines as the issue of how to correctly handle the masses, pointing the way for us to further improve "three supports and two military" work.

The great leader Chairman Mao best understands the masses, best cherishes the masses, most believes in the masses' creative power, and most respects the masses' initiative. Chairman Mao has long taught us: "We should make every comrade understand that as long as we rely on the people, firmly believe in the boundless creative power of the masses, and thus trust the people and unite with them, then no difficulties can be insurmountable, no enemy can defeat us, and we will only defeat them." Through practical struggle, we have increasingly deeply felt that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the most thorough mass line. Unswervingly believing in the masses, relying on the masses, believing in the boundless creative power of the people, and respecting the masses' initiative is the most thorough execution of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Our Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team entered the Shenyang Bearing Factory in July last year to carry out the task of supporting the left. At that time, due to the instigation of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and class enemies, as well as the influence of bourgeois factionalism in society, there was serious antagonism among the three major factions and seven revolutionary mass organizations within the factory. Although our propaganda team had done a lot of work, the effect was not significant. Just at this critical moment, after studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the revolutionary masses, out of a high sense of political responsibility, proposed to our propaganda team: "It is necessary to call together the major factions to study and exchange ideas!" The revolutionary masses' initiative gave us profound education and enlightenment. This initiative was timely and good, good in that it proposed "calling together the major factions." To call together the major factions, we did a lot of detailed political work, finally managing to convene, in late September, a two-day "study and exchange of hearts" meeting attended by representatives of various factions and revolutionary masses, with some revolutionary cadres in attendance. At this meeting, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, each faction made self-criticisms, further exchanged ideas, communicated information, increased understanding, and through consultation and deliberation, produced two pleasing results: one was reaching six agreements including "jointly convening a meeting to criticize the handful of top capitalist roaders within the Party," and the other was establishing a "revolutionary great unity preparatory group." This "study and exchange of hearts" meeting made us once again see the immense power of Mao Zedong Thought, see the common desire and firm resolve of the revolutionary masses of various factions to follow the great leader Chairman Mao and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and see the great creative power of the masses. Combining the formation process of this "study and exchange of hearts" meeting, we further studied Chairman Mao's relevant teachings and realized that this was not an ordinary "study and exchange of hearts" meeting, but a new thing of great significance created by the revolutionary masses, an important way, in a situation of serious antagonism among revolutionary mass organizations of various factions, to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, follow revolutionary principles, exchange ideas, eliminate differences, achieve unity, and jointly fight the enemy. What attitude to take towards the masses' creation is, in essence, the question of what attitude to take towards Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. To enthusiastically support and vigorously promote the healthy growth of this new thing, on the one hand, we extensively and deeply propagated among the broad masses, further educating and mobilizing them, and on the other hand, we insisted on continuing to push it forward.

However, as soon as the news spread, a handful of class enemies jumped out, openly threatening and sabotaging, and the impact and interference of bourgeois factionalism in society followed closely. The new thing of the "study and exchange of hearts" meeting faced the danger of being "blown away." These impacts and interferences, while bringing us great difficulties, also made us see more clearly the importance of "calling together the major factions." Chairman Mao taught us: "In history, new and correct things often do not get the acknowledgment of the majority at the beginning and can only develop in a tortuous way through struggle." Chairman Mao's teaching gave us immense courage and strength for struggle. Especially, in Vice Chairman Lin's speech at the celebration of the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, he conveyed the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions on holding study classes, further pointing the way for us and strengthening our confidence. We more clearly realized that only by "calling together the major factions" can we overcome bourgeois factionalism and smoothly solve the problems that have long been unsolved among the major factions. The major factions jointly holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes is an urgent need for the movement. Thus, we spared no effort to extensively propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions throughout the factory, promoting the joint holding of Mao Zedong Thought study classes by revolutionary mass organizations of various factions. The working class listens most to Chairman Mao's words, and soon the entire factory presented a new situation where the masses urged the leaders and the leaders led the masses. In mid-October, the three major factions and seven revolutionary mass organizations jointly held the first session of the Mao Zedong Thought study class, developing and perfecting the new thing of the "study and exchange of hearts" meeting. Later, relying on the masses, we overcame some twists and turns in the process of holding the study classes, making the study classes jointly held by various factions continuously consolidated and developed. Because we timely discovered the masses' creation and unswervingly supported the masses' creation, the result was effectively promoting the great unity of the revolution, the three-in-one combination of the revolution, and grasping the revolution and promoting production. The revolutionary and production situation in the entire factory was excellent and getting better and better.

From the practical struggle, we deeply felt that "the masses are the true heroes" and "the people have boundless creative power." Only by unswervingly believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and respecting the masses' initiative can we better and faster implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, always follow Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and continuously advance the revolution.

    新华社十三日讯　伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”战斗在“三支”“两军”第一线的人民解放军广大指战员，怀着无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的深厚无产阶级感情，结合切身体会，认真学习、坚决落实毛主席的最新指示，把毛主席的最新指示作为强大的思想武器，作为进一步做好“三支”“两军”工作的指路明灯，决心把“三支”“两军”工作做得好上加好。
    下面是担负“三支”“两军”任务的部分指战员，在学习伟大领袖毛主席这一最新指示后写的几篇文章：
    尊重群众的首创精神，不断把革命推向前进
    沈阳部队驻沈阳轴承厂毛泽东思想宣传队
    正当全国军民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，乘胜前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”我们结合一年多来“三支”“两军”工作的实践，学习毛主席这一最新指示，感到特别亲切。我们深深体会到：毛主席的这一最新指示，最透彻地阐明了两条路线斗争的焦点是如何正确对待群众的问题，为我们进一步做好“三支”“两军”工作指明了方向。
    伟大领袖毛主席最了解群众，最爱护群众，最相信群众的创造力，最尊重群众的首创精神。毛主席早就教导我们：“应该使每一个同志懂得，只要我们依靠人民，坚决地相信人民群众的创造力是无穷无尽的，因而信任人民，和人民打成一片，那就任何困难也能克服，任何敌人也不能压倒我们，而只会被我们所压倒。”从斗争实践中，我们越来越深刻地体会到：毛主席的无产阶级革命路线是最彻底的群众路线。坚定不移地相信群众，依靠群众，相信人民群众有无穷无尽的创造力，尊重群众的首创精神，就是最彻底地执行了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    我们这个毛泽东思想宣传队，是去年七月份进入沈阳轴承厂执行支左任务的。当时，由于党内一小撮走资派和阶级敌人的挑动，以及社会上资产阶级派性的影响，厂里三大派七个革命群众组织之间，存在着严重的对立情绪，我们宣传队虽然作了很多工作，但效果不大。正在这个节骨眼上，革命群众经过学习毛主席最新指示，出于高度的政治责任感，向我们宣传队提出建议：“应该把几大派招呼在一起学习学习，相互谈谈心，通通气！”革命群众的这个倡议，给了我们极其深刻的教育和启发。这个倡议提得及时，提得好，好就好在“把几大派招呼在一起”上。为了把几大派招呼在一起，我们进行了许多细致的思想政治工作，终于在九月下旬促成了一个由各派负责人和革命群众代表参加，部分革命干部列席，为时两天的“学习交心会”。在这次学习交心会上，各派都在毛泽东思想指引下，各自作了自我批评，进一步交流了思想，互通了情况，增进了了解，经过协商酝酿，产生了两个可喜的成果：一是达成了“联合召开批判党内一小撮最大的走资派大会”等六项协议，二是成立了“革命大联合筹备小组”。这次“学习交心会”，使我们再一次看到了毛泽东思想的无比威力，看到了各派革命群众组织紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的共同愿望和坚强决心，看到了群众的伟大创造力。我们结合这次“学习交心会”的形成过程，又深入学习了毛主席的有关教导，认识到这不是一次一般的“学习交心会”，而是革命群众创造的具有重大意义的新事物，是在各派革命群众组织严重对立的情况下，以毛泽东思想为武器，按照革命的原则，交流思想，消除分歧，达到团结一致，共同对敌的重要途径。对群众的这个创造抱什么态度，实质上也就是对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线抱什么态度的问题。为了热情支持、大力扶植这个新生事物的健康成长，我们一方面在广大群众中广泛深入地进行宣传，进一步教育和发动群众，一方面坚持继续抓下去。
    可是，消息一传开，一小撮阶级敌人跳了出来，公开进行威胁破坏，社会上资产阶级派性的冲击、干扰也接踵而来。“学习交心会”这个新生事物面临着被“吹掉”的危险。这些冲击、干扰，固然给我们带来了很大的困难，但是也促使我们更清楚地看到了
  “把几大派招呼在一起”的重要意义。毛主席教导我们：“历史上新的正确的东西，在开始的时候常常得不到多数人承认，只能在斗争中曲折地发展。”毛主席的这一教导，给我们增添了无比的斗争勇气和力量。特别是林副主席在庆祝中华人民共和国成立十八周年大会上的讲话中，传达了伟大领袖毛主席关于办学习班的最新指示，进一步给我们指明了方向，坚定了信心。我们更加明确地认识到，只有“把几大派招呼在一起”，才有利于克服资产阶级派性，顺利地解决各大派之间长时间得不到解决的问题。几大派联合举办毛泽东思想学习班，是运动发展的迫切需要。于是，我们全力以赴，在全厂深入地宣传毛主席的最新指示，促进各派革命群众组织联合举办毛泽东思想学习班。工人阶级最听毛主席的话，全厂很快出现了一个群众促头头、头头带群众的新局面。十月中旬，三大派七个革命群众组织联合办起了第一期毛泽东思想学习班，使“学习交心会”这个新事物发展了，完善了。以后，我们又依靠群众，克服了办学习班过程中出现的一些曲折，使由各派联合举办的学习班不断得到巩固和发展。由于我们及时地发现了群众的创造，坚定不移地支持了群众的创造，结果有效地推动了革命的大联合、革命的三结合和抓革命、促生产，全厂革命、生产形势一片大好，越来越好。
    我们从斗争实践中深深体会到：“群众是真正的英雄”，“人民群众有无限的创造力”。只有坚定不移地相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，才能更快更好地落实毛主席的最新指示，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，始终沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，不断把革命推向前进。
