Since last June, when U.S. imperialism and its tool, Israel, launched a large-scale invasion of Arab countries and occupied vast Arab territories, U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist clique have been colluding to intensify the so-called "political solution" to the Middle East issue, attempting to force Arab countries to surrender completely to the U.S.-Israeli invaders. This is a major conspiracy by the U.S. and the Soviet Union to suppress the Arab national liberation movement.

Over the past year, while continuing to arm Israel and incite Israel to repeatedly issue war threats and launch large-scale military provocations against Arab countries, exerting military pressure on Arab countries, U.S. imperialism has also put forward a set of plans called "political solution," which in reality are schemes to force Arab countries to surrender to the U.S.-Israeli invaders. The main content of these plans is the "five-point principle" proposed by U.S. President Johnson last June 19. This is a thorough deception.

The Soviet revisionist clique follows the U.S., singing in unison, and collaborates with the U.S. to concoct the so-called "political solution" plan. Last June, Soviet leader Kosygin rushed to the U.S. and held a "meeting" with Johnson in Glassboro, reaching a secret agreement on the so-called "political solution" to the Middle East issue based on Johnson's "five-point principle." After that, there were frequent exchanges of letters and meetings between Moscow and Washington, and Kosygin and Johnson even had direct conversations through the "hotline," making a large number of dirty political deals. They particularly emphasized the use of the United Nations to promote the "political solution" scam. The U.N. "special envoy" Jarring, acting on the instructions of U.S. imperialism, shuttled between Tel Aviv, Cairo, Amman, and Beirut dozens of times. High-level Soviet representatives, and U.S.-Soviet lackeys like Tito and Indira Gandhi, have all successively traveled to the Middle East, sparing no effort to peddle this scam.

What is the nature of the "political solution" conspiracy by the U.S. and the Soviet Union? Whom does it target? Whom does it benefit? A brief analysis of the content of the series of "resolutions" that the U.S. and the Soviet Union have been concocting in the U.N. Security Council since last June can provide the answers.

During this period, under the active collusion of the Soviet revisionist clique, U.S. imperialism manipulated the United Nations to pass a series of related "resolutions," including the U.N. Security Council's three consecutive "ceasefire resolutions" in June 1967, the Security Council's "resolution" on November 22, 1967, and the Security Council's "resolution" on April 25, 1968, etc. These "resolutions" have several common features:

First, their primary target is the Arab national liberation movement. These "resolutions" repeatedly emphasize "regret for all acts of violence," call for "ending all warlike rhetoric," and "stopping all acts of violence," etc. In a situation where the Zionist aggressors have occupied Arab lands and made more than a hundred thousand Palestinian refugees homeless for twenty years, and where Israel launched an invasion of Arab countries last year, occupying vast territories and controlling strategically advantageous regions, the United Nations brandishes its stick, shouting to "stop all acts of violence." This is clearly an attempt to pressure the Arab people, especially the Palestinian people, to lay down their arms and stop their just armed struggle to reclaim the occupied lands.

Second, these U.N. "resolutions" attempt to legally affirm the fait accompli of Israeli aggression. The "resolutions" concocted by the U.S. and the Soviet Union vigorously advocate a "ceasefire" between the two sides, actually forcing Arab countries to accept a unilateral "ceasefire," attempting to tie the hands of one billion Arab people, preventing them from waging a just struggle against aggression, while shielding and indulging the Israeli aggressors. According to an official of the Tito clique, Johnson and Kosygin also decided in their secret agreement to make "some adjustments" to the "borders" between Israel and Arab countries. Obviously, this is to allow Israel to seize more Arab lands. All of this is to affirm the fait accompli of Israeli aggression, giving this U.S. tool a more advantageous strategic position, so as to further threaten and invade Arab countries.

Third, the U.N. Security Council's "resolution" in November 1967 emphasizes the need to "guarantee the inviolability of the territories and political independence of the countries in the region." On the surface, it seems fair, but looking through the phenomenon to the essence, this is another insidious means by which the U.S., the Soviet Union, and Israel together pressure Arab countries, ignore the sovereignty of Arab countries, and force Arab countries to surrender to the U.S. tool, Israel, in the face of Israel's crazy military aggression.

Fourth, the U.N. "resolutions" also propose to guarantee "freedom of international waterways" and other clauses that favor Israel, attempting to achieve the goals that the U.S. and Israel wanted to reach but failed to fully achieve in the aggression war.

From the above facts, it is clear that the so-called "political solution" conspired by the U.S. and the Soviet Union is a political trap to induce Arab countries to surrender. It once again proves that U.S. imperialism is the most vicious enemy of the Arab people, and the Soviet revisionist clique is the U.S.'s number one accomplice.

In recent years, U.S. imperialism has been in trouble both domestically and internationally, suffering heavy losses on the Vietnam battlefield, facing intense black anti-violence struggles at home, and deepening financial crises, making life increasingly difficult. The U.S. urgently needs to strengthen its strategic position in the Middle East and maintain its huge oil interests there. However, with the widespread spread of Mao Zedong Thought, the Arab people are becoming increasingly aware, and the national liberation movement in the Arab region is further deepening, especially the armed struggle of the Palestinian people against imperialism, which is burning more fiercely, striking a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism's policy of neo-colonialism in the Middle East. In this situation, the U.S. urgently needs the Soviet revisionist accomplice to numb the anti-imperialist fighting spirit of Arab countries and extinguish the flames of the national liberation movement and armed struggle in the region.

The Soviet revisionist clique has consistently pursued a counter-revolutionary revisionist foreign policy line of "peaceful coexistence" between the aggressors and the invaded in the Middle East, advocating that the Arab people and their mortal enemy, U.S. imperialism, and its tool, Israel, "peacefully coexist," realizing the so-called "Tashkent spirit." It hates and fears the national liberation movement, especially the people's armed struggle, dreading that the anti-imperialist revolutionary storm of the Arab people will disrupt its and the U.S.'s control and plunder of the Middle East region, shattering its dream of "U.S.-Soviet cooperation to rule the world." This line of surrender and betrayal is completely to collaborate with the U.S. to suppress the Arab national liberation movement and play a role that the U.S. cannot play.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "The oppressed peoples and oppressed nations can never entrust their liberation to the 'wisdom' of imperialism and its running dogs, but can only achieve victory through strengthening unity and persisting in struggle."

The increasingly awakened Arab people are neither intimidated nor deceived. Recently, in anti-U.S. demonstration rallies, the Arab people have shouted out a resounding slogan: "What is taken by force must be taken back by force!" Recently, "Fatah" (Palestine Liberation Movement) issued a statement in Beirut, solemnly pointing out: "We reject all the resolutions of the United Nations on the Palestinian question." The statement expresses: "Fatah" rejects the "political solution" scam peddled by the U.N. "special envoy" Jarring, "We reject all means of limiting the struggle of the Palestinian people to liberate their homeland." A responsible person of "Fatah" clearly said, "Fatah" knows only one plan, that is "to wage armed struggle to achieve the final liberation of Palestine." Another responsible person said, "No matter how many difficulties we encounter, we are determined to fight on until we achieve final victory." Since the beginning of this year, Palestinian guerrillas have launched more than 200 attacks in Israeli-occupied areas, giving the aggressors a severe beating, which is a powerful response to the "political solution" scam conspired by the U.S. and the Soviet Union.

The contradiction between the Arab people and U.S. imperialism and its accomplices is irreconcilable. The U.S. and the Soviet Union attempt to extinguish the flames of the Arab people's anti-imperialist struggle through the scam of "political solution," which is sheer fantasy. Currently, the national liberation movement in the Arab region is further deepening. The seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought firmly support the just struggle of the Arab people. One billion Arab people, closely united, persist in long-term struggle, and will surely overcome all difficulties, defeat all enemies, and achieve final victory in the anti-imperialist struggle.

    美苏策划“政治解决”中东问题的阴谋  扑灭不了阿拉伯人民反帝斗争的烈火
    阿拉伯人民从实践中认识到美帝是最凶恶的敌人，苏修是美帝的头号帮凶
    新华社五日讯　本社记者述评：自从去年六月，美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列向阿拉伯国家发动大规模侵略战争，侵占了阿拉伯大片土地之后，美帝国主义同苏修叛徒集团狼狈为奸，加紧策划中东问题的所谓“政治解决”，妄图逼迫阿拉伯国家向美以侵略者全面投降。这是美苏合谋镇压阿拉伯民族解放运动的大阴谋。
    一年来，美帝国主义一方面继续加紧武装以色列，唆使以色列不断发出战争叫嚣，向阿拉伯国家连续发动大规模军事挑衅，对阿拉伯国家施加军事压力；另一方面抛出了一套名为“政治解决”，实际上是逼迫阿拉伯国家向美以侵略者投降的方案。这些方案的主要内容就是美帝头子约翰逊去年六月十九日提出的“五点原则”。这是一个彻头彻尾的大骗局。
    苏修叛徒集团紧跟美帝，一唱一和，同美帝合伙炮制所谓“政治解决”方案。苏修头目柯西金去年六月跑到美国，在葛拉斯堡罗和约翰逊举行“会谈”，在约翰逊的“五点原则”的基础上，就所谓“政治解决”中东问题达成了秘密协议。在这以后，莫斯科与华盛顿之间函电往来频繁，使节会谈络绎不绝，柯西金和约翰逊还通过“热线”直接通话，作了大量肮脏的政治交易。他们特别着重利用联合国来推销“政治解决”的骗局。联合国“特使”雅林秉承美帝的意旨，奔走于特拉维夫、开罗、安曼和贝鲁特之间不下数十回。苏修的高级代表团，美苏的走狗铁托、英迪拉·甘地之流，都先后到中东活动，不遗余力地兜售这个骗局。
    美苏合谋的“政治解决”骗局究竟是什么货色？它的矛头究竟指向谁？对谁有利？只要对美苏从去年六月以来在联合国安理会炮制的一系列“决议”的内容略加分析，就不难求得答案。
    这一时期，美帝国主义在苏修叛徒集团的积极配合下，操纵联合国通过的有关“决议”有：一九六七年六月安理会的连续三次“停火决议”，一九六七年十一月二十二日安理会的“决议”，一九六八年四月二十五日安理会的“决议”等等。这些“决议”有几个共同的特点：一、它们的矛头首先是指向阿拉伯民族解放运动的。这些“决议”反复强调“对一切暴力行动表示遗憾”，要求“结束一切好战言论”，“制止一切暴力行动”等等。在以色列犹太复国主义者用反革命暴力侵占了阿拉伯土地、使得一百多万巴勒斯坦难民二十年来流离失所、无家可归的情况下，在以色列去年又对阿拉伯国家发动侵略战争，侵占了大片土地，军事上控制了有利的战略地区之后，联合国却挥舞着警棍，叫嚷要“制止一切暴力行动”，这分明是向阿拉伯人民特别是巴勒斯坦人民施加压力，妄图逼迫巴勒斯坦人民放下武器，停止为争取收复被侵占的土地而进行的正义的武装斗争。
    二、联合国的这些“决议”企图把以色列侵略所造成的既成事实，从法律上加以肯定。美苏合伙炮制的“决议”，极力鼓吹双方“停火”，实际上是强迫阿拉伯国家单方面接受“停火”，妄图束缚一亿阿拉伯人民的手脚，不许他们进行反侵略的正义斗争，而对以色列侵略者则百般庇护和纵容。据铁托叛徒集团的官员透露，约翰逊和柯西金在秘密协议中还决定要对以色列和阿拉伯国家之间的“边界”作“一些调整”。显然这是要让以色列霸占更多的阿拉伯土地。所有这些，都是为了肯定以色列侵略所造成的既成事实，使这个美国的侵略工具取得战略上更加有利的地位，以便进一步威胁和侵略阿拉伯国家。
    三、一九六七年十一月安理会的“决议”，强调什么要“保证该地区各国领土不可侵犯和政治独立”。表面看来，貌似公正，但透过现象看本质，这是美苏伙同以色列，向阿拉伯国家施加压力，无视阿拉伯国家的主权，强迫阿拉伯国家在以色列疯狂的军事侵略面前，向美帝侵略工具以色列屈服的另一阴险手段。
    四、联合国的“决议”还提出保证“国际水道通航自由”等等偏袒以色列的其他一些条款，企图实现美以在侵略战争中要想达到而未能完全达到的目的。
    从以上事实可以看得一清二楚，美苏合谋的所谓“政治解决”是一个诱迫阿拉伯国家投降的政治圈套。它再一次证明美帝国主义是阿拉伯人民最凶恶的敌人，苏修叛徒集团是美帝的头号帮凶。
    近几年来，美帝内外交困，在越南战场上被打得焦头烂额，国内黑人抗暴斗争如火如荼，金融危机日益加深，日子越来越不好过。美帝急需加强它在中东的战略地位和保持它在中东的巨大石油利益。但是，随着毛泽东思想的广泛传播，阿拉伯人民正在日益觉醒，阿拉伯地区的民族解放运动正在进一步深入发展，特别是巴勒斯坦人民反帝武装斗争的烈火越烧越旺，有力地打击着美帝国主义在中东推行的新殖民主义政策。在这种情况下，美帝非常需要苏修这个帮凶来麻痹阿拉伯国家反帝斗志和扑灭这个地区的民族解放运动与武装斗争的烈火。
    苏修叛徒集团在中东一贯推行要被侵略者同侵略者“和平共处”的反革命修正主义外交总路线，鼓吹阿拉伯人民和他们的死敌美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列“和平共处”，实现所谓“塔什干精神”。它对民族解放运动，特别是人民的武装斗争，怕得要死，恨得要命，唯恐阿拉伯人民的反帝革命风暴破坏它和美帝对中东地区的控制和掠夺，打破它实现“美苏合作主宰世界”的美梦。这种投降叛卖的外交路线，完全是为了配合美帝镇压阿拉伯民族解放运动，并且起着美帝所不能起的作用。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“被压迫人民和被压迫民族，决不能把自己的解放寄托在帝国主义及其走狗的‘明智’上面，而只有通过加强团结、坚持斗争，才能取得胜利。”
    日益觉醒了的阿拉伯人民是吓不倒也骗不了的。阿拉伯人民群众最近在反美示威的集会中喊出了响亮的口号：“用武力夺去的东西要用武力夺回！”最近“法塔赫”（巴勒斯坦解放运动）在贝鲁特发表声明严正指出：“我们拒绝联合国对巴勒斯坦问题的全部决议。”声明表示：“法塔赫”拒绝联合国“特使”雅林兜售的“政治解决”骗局，“我们拒绝限制巴勒斯坦人民解放他们家园斗争的一切方式。”“法塔赫”一位负责人明确地说，“法塔赫”只知道一个方案，那就是“进行武装斗争，以争取巴勒斯坦的最后解放”。另一位负责人表示，“不管我们会碰到多少困难，我们决心斗争下去，直到取得最后胜利”。今年以来，巴勒斯坦游击队在以色列侵占区出击二百多次，狠揍侵略者，这就是对美苏合谋的“政治解决”骗局的有力回击。
    阿拉伯人民同美帝国主义及其帮凶的矛盾，是不可调和的。美苏企图通过“政治解决”的骗局，阴谋扑灭阿拉伯人民反帝斗争的烈火，完全是痴心妄想。目前阿拉伯地区的民族解放运动正在进一步深入发展。用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，坚决支持阿拉伯人民的正义斗争。一亿阿拉伯人民紧密团结起来，坚持长期斗争，就一定能克服一切困难，战胜一切敌人，取得反帝斗争的最后胜利。
