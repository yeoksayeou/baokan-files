The revolutionary and production achievements of the revolutionary workers of Qingdao Port Bureau during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution vividly prove the absolute correctness of the great leader Chairman Mao's wise judgment in the "Sixteen Points" he personally drafted: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to make people's thinking revolutionary, so that all work can be done more, faster, better, and more economically." Since the Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers of Qingdao Port Bureau, with the help of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the port, have armed themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, greatly promoting ideological revolutionization. With unwavering revolutionary will and boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, they have achieved outstanding production results. Last year, the entire port exceeded the annual loading and unloading tasks by 17.5%, setting a new record for the port's throughput. This year, the port's throughput has increased month by month, and the loading and unloading tasks have been completed ahead of schedule each month. In May, the port's throughput increased by 19% compared to April, and the loading and unloading tasks were completed five days ahead of schedule.

    青岛港务局革命和生产形势好
    青岛港务局广大革命职工在无产阶级文化大革命中取得的革命、生产双胜利，生动地证实了伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”中指出的“无产阶级文化大革命，就是为的要使人的思想革命化，因而使各项工作做得更多、更快、更好、更省”这个英明论断的无比正确。文化大革命以来，青岛港务局广大革命职工在驻港人民解放军的帮助下，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，大大促进了思想革命化，他们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚，以顽强的革命意志，夺得了生产上的优异成绩。去年，全港超额百分之十七点五完成了全年装卸任务，创造了这个港历史上港口吞吐量的最高纪录。今年以来，港口吞吐量月月增加，装卸任务月月超额完成。五月份港口的吞吐量比四月份又增加百分之十九，装卸任务提前五天完成。
