The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Henan Province enthusiastically celebrated the achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have completed the summer grain procurement task ahead of schedule and with excellent quality. The enthusiasm, speed, and quality of the grain delivery are unprecedented.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, June 29th - The Henan Province, which has achieved a bumper harvest of wheat, has, by June 25th, completed its summer grain procurement task ahead of schedule. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the province enthusiastically celebrate the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the fruits of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In the past two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Henan's rural areas have undergone a thorough transformation. They have channelled the revolutionary enthusiasm stirred up by the Cultural Revolution into production, achieving a bumper harvest of wheat this year. Following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, "We must plan, act, and think from the perspective of our country having 600 million people," and "In the matter of distribution, we must consider the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual," they correctly handle the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual. They enthusiastically deliver grain to the state, contributing to the socialist revolution and socialist construction. When the wheat started to be harvested, the entire province launched a wave of delivering summer grain. In the middle of June, the roads leading to the grain stations in various parts of the province were adorned with red flags and filled with the sound of drums. Vehicles carrying grain were constantly coming and going. Many people's communes and production teams completed their summer grain delivery tasks within a few days. This year, the Nanyang region and the Zhoukou region of the eastern plain of Henan, which had a bumper harvest of wheat, completed their summer grain delivery tasks to the state ahead of schedule in a short period of time.

The poor and lower-middle peasants in some old disaster-stricken areas also actively delivered public grain and surplus grain to the state after achieving a bumper harvest. The enthusiasm of the masses in various places to deliver summer grain to the state, the speed of delivery, and the quality of the grain delivered to the state are all unprecedented.

The revolutionary committees at various levels in Henan Province firmly remember Chairman Mao's great teaching, "Never forget class struggle," and lead the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to fiercely grasp the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads. They deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism and launch a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the countryside fiercely criticize the "class struggle extinction" theory and "material incentives" and other counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods spread by Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Henan. They greatly enhance their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. They hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. After achieving a bumper harvest, they actively deliver summer grain, supporting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and supporting the state's socialist construction. Deng County, which had a bumper harvest of wheat last year, increased production by more than 10% this year and delivered 140 million jin of grain to the state in one season, exceeding the highest level of summer grain delivery in history.

The revolutionary cadres at various levels of the grain departments in Henan Province have, in the summer grain procurement work this year, vigorously emphasized proletarian politics and turned the grain stations distributed in various places into stations for propagating Mao Zedong Thought. With the greatest enthusiasm, they use various forms to widely and deeply propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions and propagate the good people and good deeds that have emerged in the delivery of summer grain, making the grain stations full of vigorous revolutionary scenes.

    广大贫下中农热烈欢呼无产阶级文化大革命丰硕成果
    河南超额完成今年夏粮征购任务
    各地群众向国家交售夏粮热情高，进度快，质量好，都是空前的
    新华社郑州二十九日电　获得小麦丰收的河南省，到六月二十五日，已经超额完成了夏粮征购任务。广大贫下中农热烈欢呼毛主席无产阶级革命路线的胜利，欢呼无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果。
    河南农村广大贫下中农，经过两年来无产阶级文化大革命的战斗锻炼，精神面貌焕然一新。他们把在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的革命干劲用到生产上，夺得了今年的小麦丰收。他们在丰收之后，遵照伟大领袖毛主席
  “我们作计划、办事、想问题，都要从我国有六亿人口这一点出发”，“在分配问题上，我们必须兼顾国家利益、集体利益和个人利益”的教导，正确处理国家、集体和个人三者之间的关系，踊跃向国家交售粮食，为社会主义革命和社会主义建设贡献力量。全省广大农村在麦子开始收打的时候，就掀起了交售夏粮的高潮。六月上中旬，全省各地通往粮站的大路上，红旗招展，锣鼓喧天，运粮的车辆来往不断。许多人民公社和生产队三两天内就完成了夏粮交售任务。今年获得小麦大丰收的南阳地区和豫东平原的周口地区，都在较短的时间内超额完成了向国家交售夏粮的任务。
  一些老灾区的贫下中农获得丰收后，今年也都积极向国家交公粮售余粮。各地群众向国家交售夏粮热情之高，进度之快，向国家交售的粮食质量之好，都是空前的。
    河南省各级革命委员会牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，率领全省广大贫下中农，狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，向一小撮阶级敌人发起了猛烈进攻。广大贫下中农和农村革命干部，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在河南的代理人散布的“阶级斗争熄灭”论和“物质刺激”等反革命修正主义黑货，大大提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。他们更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，在取得丰收之后，积极交售夏粮，支援无产阶级文化大革命，支援国家的社会主义建设。去年获得小麦大丰收的邓县，今年又比去年增产一成以上，一季就向国家交售了一亿四千万斤粮食，超过了历史上交售夏粮的最高水平。
    河南省各级粮食部门的广大革命职工，在今年夏粮征购工作中，大力突出无产阶级政治，把分布在各地的粮站办成了毛泽东思想宣传站。他们以最大的热情，利用各种形式，广泛深入地宣传毛主席的最新指示，宣传在交售夏粮中涌现出来的好人好事，使粮站到处充满朝气蓬勃的革命景象。
