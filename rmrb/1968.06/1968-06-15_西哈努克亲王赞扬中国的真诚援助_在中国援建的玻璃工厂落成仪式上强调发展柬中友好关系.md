Thousands of local residents attended the ceremony, enthusiastically cheering the new achievements in Cambodian-Chinese friendly cooperation.

The national flags of Cambodia and China fluttered in the wind at the entrance of the factory. The main building of the factory had large characters reading: "Long live Cambodian-Chinese friendship!"

Prince Sihanouk delivered a speech at the ceremony. He said, "This factory is a new gift from our very friendly neighbor, China, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong." He said, "China's aid to Cambodia is sincere, effective, and unconditional."

When talking about Cambodian-Chinese relations, Prince Sihanouk said, "China under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong is Cambodia's number one friend." He said, "Now, Cambodia and China face common enemies, and we must develop friendly relations between the two countries."

Acting Charge d'affaires Zheng Sixiong, in his speech, warmly praised the strong friendship between China and Cambodia that has developed in the struggle against the common enemy, American imperialism. He said that American imperialism and its lackeys fear the friendship that binds China and Cambodia together, and they have used every trick to try to destroy it. However, we are deeply convinced that no enemy can destroy this tried and tested friendship between China and Cambodia. He said that if American imperialism dares to expand its aggressive war to Cambodia, the Chinese people will definitely stand firmly with the Cambodian people and provide strong support. Acting Charge d'affaires Zheng Sixiong finally wished Her Majesty the Queen good health! Prince Sihanouk good health! Prosperity to the Kingdom of Cambodia! Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Cambodia!

Cambodian Minister of Industry Kim Chhuon also spoke at the completion ceremony.

Prince Sihanouk, amid enthusiastic applause, unveiled the copper plaque for the China-Cambodia Friendship Factory. Then, Prince Sihanouk carefully toured the factory. After the tour, he wrote in the factory's guestbook: "I express my deepest gratitude to the People's Republic of China for helping Cambodia to have a modern industry. Long live Chairman Mao Zedong! Long live Cambodian-Chinese friendship!"

Prince Sihanouk personally awarded medals to Chinese technical personnel and model Cambodian workers. That evening, Prince Sihanouk hosted a banquet for all Chinese technical personnel. The entire staff of the Chinese Embassy was also invited to the banquet. The banquet proceeded in a warm and friendly atmosphere. The Royal University of Fine Arts' chamber orchestra played "The East Is Red," a song composed by Prince Sihanouk, "Remembering China," and some other Chinese songs using Chinese instruments.
