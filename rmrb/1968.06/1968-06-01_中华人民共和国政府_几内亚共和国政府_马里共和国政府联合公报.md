	Joint Communiqué of the Governments of the People's Republic of China, the Republic of Guinea, and the Republic of Mali

	BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Governments of the People's Republic of China, the Republic of Guinea, and the Republic of Mali have issued the following joint communiqué:

	At the invitation of the Government of the People's Republic of China, His Excellency Ousmane Ba, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and His Excellency Lansana Beavogui, Minister of Foreign Affairs, led a joint friendly delegation from Guinea and Mali to visit China from May 18 to 25, 1968.

	The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, and his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, received His Excellency Ousmane Ba, His Excellency Lansana Beavogui, and the entire delegation, engaging in cordial and friendly conversations. The delegation conveyed the deep friendship of President Ahmed Sékou Touré and President Modibo Keïta to Chairman Mao. Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the People's Republic of China held meetings and talks with the foreign ministers of Guinea and Mali and the entire delegation.

	Vice Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs Chen Yi, and Vice Premier Li Xiannian held sincere and friendly talks with His Excellency Ousmane Ba and His Excellency Lansana Beavogui.

	The three sides reviewed with satisfaction the fruitful cooperation between the three countries in the political, economic, and cultural fields in the past, and exchanged comprehensive views on further consolidating and developing these relations in the future.

	The three governments announced that on May 24, 1968, the Governments of China, Guinea, and Mali signed an agreement on the construction of the Guinea-Mali Railway, which is a new and important milestone in the friendly cooperation between the three countries.

	The Government of the People's Republic of China warmly praises the achievements of the Republic of Guinea and the Republic of Mali in opposing imperialism and old and new colonialism, safeguarding national independence, and developing the national economy, as well as their contributions to supporting the national liberation struggles in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

	The Government of the People's Republic of China highly values the important role played by the further strengthening of unity and cooperation between the two brotherly countries of Guinea and Mali in the cause of African peoples' unity and anti-imperialist struggle. The Government of the People's Republic of China firmly supports the just struggles of the peoples of Guinea and Mali.

	The three sides extensively exchanged views on the international situation and matters of common concern, and unanimously agreed that the current world revolution has entered a great new era. The national democratic revolutionary movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, together with the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed peoples in Europe and North America, are dealing decisive blows to the imperialist and colonialist systems.

	The three governments reaffirm that the peoples of the three countries resolutely support the Vietnamese people's war of national salvation against imperialist aggression. The U.S. and other aggressor troops must withdraw entirely from South Vietnam, and the Vietnamese people must be allowed to resolve the Vietnamese problem themselves.

	The three sides are pleased to see that the anti-imperialist struggles of the Arab and African peoples are being carried out more extensively and deeply. The three governments reaffirm their resolute support for the struggles of the Arab peoples against imperialism and its tool, Israel, and for the struggles of the peoples of Guinea-Bissau, Angola, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, South Africa, South West Africa, Swaziland, the Somali coast, and other regions of Africa still under colonial rule to achieve national independence.

	The foreign ministers of Guinea and Mali highly praised Chairman Mao Zedong's statement on April 16, 1968, supporting the anti-violence struggle of the American Black people. In this statement, Chairman Mao Zedong reiterated: "The evil system of colonialism and imperialism, which rose and thrived on the enslavement and trafficking of the Negro people, will surely come to an end with the thorough emancipation of the Negro race."

	The foreign ministers of Guinea and Mali warmly praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, and the great achievements made by the Chinese people in socialist revolution and socialist construction.

	The three governments believe that the visit of the joint friendly delegation from Guinea and Mali to China has further consolidated and strengthened the friendship between the peoples of the three countries and the friendly cooperative relations between the three countries, and has made a positive contribution to the cause of unity and anti-imperialism of the Asian and African peoples.
