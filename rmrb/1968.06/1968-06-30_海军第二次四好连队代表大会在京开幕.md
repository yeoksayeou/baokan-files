The Second Conference of the Navy's "Four Good" Units Representatives, held under the auspices of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, opened in Beijing on June 28, 1968. This conference is a significant event in the ongoing Cultural Revolution, aimed at furthering the revolutionary spirit and military preparedness of the Navy.

The conference is a rallying call to implement Chairman Mao's latest directives, deepen the revolutionary criticism, and ensure the full realization of Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness." It is also a response to Vice Chairman Lin's call to continue the "Four Good" units movement in the new context of the Cultural Revolution, ensuring that Mao's military line is fully implemented at the grassroots level.

Since the initiation of the "Four Good" units movement, the Navy has adhered to Mao's proletarian military line and Vice Chairman Lin's guidelines, which emphasize political education, the "Four Firsts," the "Three-Eight" spirit, the "Three Democracies," and the "Four Good" units movement. These principles have helped the Navy to overcome the disruptive influence of counter-revolutionary revisionists like Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, who advocated a bourgeois military line. The movement has significantly enhanced the ideological transformation of the units, ensuring that Mao's military line is effectively implemented at the grassroots level.

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Navy has focused on studying and applying Mao's works, conducting revolutionary criticism, and participating in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work. This has led to new developments in the "Four Good" units movement, ensuring the implementation of Mao's military line at the grassroots level, accelerating the revolutionary construction of the troops, and cultivating a large number of revolutionary vanguard soldiers. Many advanced units have emerged, ensuring the full implementation of Mao's latest directives and the outstanding completion of preparedness, training, and various tasks, thereby safeguarding national defense and the Cultural Revolution.

The conference began with the majestic song "The East Is Red." Over a thousand representatives recited Mao's inscription for the Navy: "To oppose the aggression of imperialism, we must build a powerful navy." They also studied Vice Chairman Lin's inscription: "Navigating the vast ocean relies on the helmsman; doing revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought."

Deputy Political Commissar of the Navy, Wang Hongkun, delivered the opening speech. He welcomed the representatives from the front lines of national defense, the "Three Supports, Two Militaries," and various combat positions. He congratulated them on their achievements in creating "Four Good" units amidst the Cultural Revolution. He emphasized that Mao has always attached great importance to strengthening the grassroots level of the army. From the early days of the army's establishment, Mao stressed that "the party branch should be established at the company level" and that "the foundation of the army lies in the soldiers." He repeatedly emphasized the importance of strengthening ideological and political work at the grassroots level. Vice Chairman Lin's initiative to launch the "Four Good" units movement is a creative application of Mao's military thought to address the problems of grassroots construction in the army. This movement is a crucial part of the series of political military principles proposed by Vice Chairman Lin based on Mao's military line and is an important guarantee for their implementation at the grassroots level. Experience has shown that by deeply promoting this movement, Mao's military line and the series of political military principles proposed by Vice Chairman Lin can be fully implemented at the grassroots level through the "Four Good" aspects of work. The "Four Good" units movement is not a temporary measure but a major strategic measure and a permanent principle for the army's construction.

Wang Hongkun said, "Mao taught us: 'The correct political and military lines are not naturally and peacefully produced and developed, but are produced and developed through struggle.' In promoting the 'Four Good' units movement, we have been in a sharp struggle with the bourgeois military line. It is in this way that we have repeatedly smashed the interference and sabotage of the counter-revolutionary revisionists, such as China's Khrushchev, Peng Dehuai, and Luo Ruiqing, and resolutely implemented Mao's military line and the series of political military principles proposed by Vice Chairman Lin. The most fundamental experience is that Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of our army, and Mao's military line is the only correct line for army building. As long as we firmly follow the path of Mao Zedong Thought and Mao's military line, the 'Four Good' units movement will be victorious and develop; if we deviate even slightly from the path of Mao Zedong Thought and Mao's military line, the 'Four Good' units movement will go astray."

Wang Hongkun emphasized that we must further strengthen the fundamental aspect of the "Four Good" units—political and ideological excellence. We must always prioritize political and ideological work, always insist on studying and applying Mao's works, and carry out thorough ideological transformations. We must remember Mao's teaching of "grasp revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness," using political and ideological excellence to lead, promote, and drive the other three aspects of excellence. While focusing on political and ideological excellence, we must also pay attention to the other three aspects: the "Three-Eight" spirit, military training, and living management.

The representatives of the "Four Good" units spoke at the conference, expressing their determination to use Mao Zedong Thought as their guide. They will summarize and share new experiences in promoting the "Four Good" units movement in the new context of the Cultural Revolution and the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines. They will further implement Mao's military line and the series of political military principles proposed by Vice Chairman Lin, raising the "Four Good" units movement to a new level.

Attending the opening ceremony were Huang Yongsheng, Wu Faxian, Li Zuopeng, Qiu Huizuo, Liu Xianquan, and other comrades. Also present were senior Navy officials such as Xiao Jingguang, Zhao Qimin, Zhou Xihan, and Zhang Xiuquan.

    坚定地沿着毛泽东思想和毛主席建军路线的轨道前进
    海军第二次四好连队代表大会在京开幕
    四好连队代表表示：要以毛泽东思想为指针，总结和交流在无产阶级文化大革命的新形势下，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中，开展四好连队运动的新经验，把四好连队运动提高到新水平
    新华社二十九日讯  在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的空前大好形势下，中国人民解放军海军第二次四好连队代表大会，二十八日在北京隆重开幕。
    这次大会，是紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，落实毛主席最新指示，继续深入开展革命大批判，进一步落实毛主席
  “抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大方针，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的誓师大会；是响应林副主席继续开展四好连队运动的伟大号召，在无产阶级文化大革命的新形势下，进一步在基层贯彻落实毛主席的建军路线，落实林副主席根据毛主席建军路线提出的一整套着重政治建军的方针原则，把海军创造四好连队运动提高到新水平的动员大会。
    海军部队开展创造四好连队运动以来，遵照毛主席的无产阶级建军路线，遵照林副主席根据毛主席的建军路线提出的活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治、坚持四个第一、大兴三八作风、发扬三大民主、开展四好连队运动等一系列着重政治建军的方针原则，粉碎了反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿所推行的资产阶级反动军事路线的种种干扰和破坏，狠抓基层建设，有力地促进了连队的思想革命化。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，海军部队紧紧抓住创造四好连队运动的根本的根本——活学活用毛主席著作，开展以林副主席为光辉榜样，永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席革命路线的“三忠于”活动，深入持久地进行革命大批判，参加“三支”“两军”工作，使四好连队运动有了新的发展。四好连队运动有力地保证了毛主席建军路线在基层的落实，加速了部队革命化建设的进程，培养了大批无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的先锋战士，涌现出大批先进单位，保证了毛主席最新指示的全面落实，出色地完成了战备、训练和各项工作，在保卫国防、保卫无产阶级文化大革命中为人民立了新功。
    大会在雄壮的《东方红》歌声中开始。一千多名代表齐声朗读毛主席给海军的光辉题词：“为了反对帝国主义的侵略，我们一定要建立强大的海军”。学习林副主席的题词：“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。
    海军第二政治委员王宏坤同志致开幕词。他代表海军领导机关向来自海防前哨、“三支”“两军”第一线和各个战斗岗位的四好连队代表表示热烈欢迎，对他们在无产阶级文化大革命中迎着阶级斗争风浪，创造四好连队取得的显著成绩，表示衷心的祝贺。他说，毛主席历来十分重视加强我军的基层建设。早在我军建军初期，毛主席就规定“支部建在连上”。毛主席指出“军队的基础在士兵”，并一再强调加强基层的思想政治工作。林副主席提出的开展四好连队运动，是创造性地运用毛主席军事思想解决我军基层建设问题的范例。开展四好连队运动，既是林副主席根据毛主席建军路线提出的一整套着重政治建军的方针原则的组成部分，又是这些方针原则在基层落实的重要保证。经验证明，深入开展这一运动，就可以通过“四好”四个方面的工作，把毛主席的建军路线以及林副主席根据毛主席建军路线提出的一整套着重政治建军的方针原则在基层全面落实。开展四好连队运动，决不是一项临时性的措施，而是一项重大的战略措施，是我军永远建设的方针。
    王宏坤同志说，毛主席教导我们：“正确的政治的和军事的路线，不是自然地平安地产生和发展起来的，而是从斗争中产生和发展起来的。”我们在开展四好连队运动中，一直同资产阶级反动军事路线进行着尖锐的斗争。我们正是这样一次又一次地粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫及反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿的干扰和破坏，坚决贯彻毛主席的建军路线以及林副主席根据毛主席建军路线提出的一整套着重政治建军的方针原则，把四好连队运动轰轰烈烈地开展了起来。我们的经验最根本的一条就是：毛泽东思想是我军的命根子，毛主席的建军路线是我军建设唯一正确的路线。坚定地沿着毛泽东思想和毛主席建军路线的轨道前进，四好连队运动就胜利，就发展；稍微离开毛泽东思想和毛主席建军路线的轨道，四好连队运动就会走上邪路。
    王宏坤同志强调说，我们必须进一步抓好“四好”的根本——政治思想好，永远自觉地把政治思想工作放在首位，永远坚持活学活用毛主席著作，大搞人的思想革命化。必须牢记毛主席“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的教导，用政治思想好去统帅、促进和带动其它三好，在抓好政治思想好的前提下，也要重视抓好三八作风好，军事训练好和生活管理好。
    四好连队代表在大会上讲话，表示要以毛泽东思想为指针，总结和交流在无产阶级文化大革命的新形势下，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中，开展四好连队运动的新经验，进一步贯彻执行毛主席的建军路线和林副主席根据毛主席建军路线提出的一整套着重政治建军的方针原则，把四好连队运动提高到新水平。
    黄永胜、吴法宪、李作鹏、邱会作、刘贤权等同志出席了大会开幕式。
    参加大会开幕式的还有海军负责同志萧劲光、赵启民、周希汉、张秀川等。
