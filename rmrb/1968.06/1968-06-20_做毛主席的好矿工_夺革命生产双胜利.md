The revolutionary committee of Pingxiang Mining Bureau focuses on class struggle, building an industrial army armed with Mao Zedong Thought throughout the mine.

The revolutionary committee of this bureau led the broad revolutionary workers to launch a fierce attack on class enemies, smashing their counter-revolutionary restoration plots; deeply and persistently carrying out revolutionary criticism, eliminating the poison of the Chinese Khrushchev. The broad revolutionary workers are full of vigor and have achieved significant victories in seizing the revolution and promoting production, completing the state production plan ahead of schedule month after month, and creating a new historical record for the daily production of existing mines.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang: The revolutionary committee of Pingxiang Coal Mine Bureau has taken over the revolutionary tradition personally established by Chairman Mao in the red Anshan, focusing on class struggle, leading the broad revolutionary workers to launch a fierce attack on class enemies, exposing the hidden class enemies one by one, smashing their counter-revolutionary restoration plots, and achieving significant victories in seizing the revolution and promoting production. In the fierce class struggle, the revolutionary committee has been further consolidated and has exerted tremendous power.

After the revolutionary committee of this bureau was established in March, the coal production of the entire mine increased by 17% compared to February; in April, it increased by 19.62% compared to March, completing the state plan two days ahead of schedule; in May, it completed the state plan six days ahead of schedule and exceeded it, creating a new historical record for the daily production of existing mines.

Taking Over the Revolutionary Tradition Established by Chairman Mao in Red Anshan

Pingxiang Coal Mine is the source of the workers' movement personally initiated by the great leader Chairman Mao. As early as the 1920s, Chairman Mao, in the Anshan Mine here, opposed the class capitulationist line vigorously promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev at the time, and led the workers to launch a brave and unyielding struggle against the class enemies. Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on class struggle took deep root in Pingxiang Coal Mine and became a revolutionary tradition passed down from generation to generation. The revolutionary committee of the mining bureau, born in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has taken over this glorious tradition, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, focusing on class struggle, and with a vigorous revolutionary spirit, leading the broad revolutionary workers to launch a fierce attack on class enemies.

When the revolutionary committee was first established, class enemies incited anarchism, seriously affecting production. Some cadres, seeing that production was not improving, put on work clothes, picked up wind drills and picks, and led the way down into the mine. However, the passive situation in production could not be reversed. Was the responsibility of the leadership to grasp the wind drills for mining or the direction of class struggle? The revolutionary committee, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "go among the masses and learn from them," organized cadres to go among the people to solve this problem. They learned a lot of vivid class struggle facts from revolutionary workers and saw that the workers cared not only about production but also about class struggle. When class enemies stirred up anarchist winds in a mine, attempting to sabotage the underground water pump room, some old workers stood up, even mobilizing their families. Some workers worked continuously for 24 hours, learning to operate water pumps; others got up every night to check the water situation. Old workers told the cadres: "If class struggle is relaxed, class enemies will attack. Neglecting class struggle is the greatest disloyalty to the proletarian revolutionary cause. You must always remember Chairman Mao's teaching: 'Never forget class struggle'!"

After the cadres went among the people and received a vivid and profound class struggle education, the revolutionary committee of the mining bureau organized a discussion on the issue of "whether to grasp the wind drills for mining or the direction of class struggle" to further raise class struggle awareness. During the discussion, the cadres first seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, then linked them to reality, and checked themselves. They unanimously realized that coal mining production is also permeated with class struggle, fighting a political battle, and the mine is a battlefield for class struggle. The primary responsibility of the leadership is to grasp the "direction" of class struggle. If they only grasp the wind drills and not the "direction," they cannot represent the fundamental interests of the working class, and the political power seized by the proletariat is in danger of being lost again. After everyone's awareness was raised, the revolutionary committee of the mining bureau held a rally of representatives from the entire bureau in the Anshan Mine, where Chairman Mao led the workers' struggle, to swear to "take over the revolutionary tradition and launch a fierce attack on class enemies."

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and its led revolutionary people and the reactionary Kuomintang. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Chairman Mao's great directive has given the revolutionary workers of the entire bureau great encouragement and strength. Old workers who had fought alongside Chairman Mao were excited to express to the revolutionary committee: "Chairman Mao has issued the order, so you lead everyone to launch a fierce attack on class enemies!"

Carrying Forward the Resolute and Thorough Revolutionary Spirit of the Proletariat, Not Giving Class Enemies a Breathing Space

When the revolutionary committee led the masses to launch a fierce offensive against class enemies, due to the enemies' desperate resistance and fierce counterattacks, using more vicious means to sabotage production, the coal production tasks became even more urgent. At this time, some people proposed to first focus on coal and get production up before dealing with class enemies. The revolutionary committee believed that this active thought, in essence, was about whether to advance or retreat against the enemy, and whether to insist on taking class struggle as the key link and promoting production through revolution. The revolutionary committee educated the broad revolutionary workers with the great revolutionary practice of Chairman Mao leading the workers' struggle in Anshan, insisting on carrying forward the resolute and thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, not giving class enemies a breathing space.

The broad revolutionary workers, armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong, formed a vast revolutionary army, and firmly, accurately, and resolutely struck down a small handful of class enemies. Revolutionary cadres at all levels acted decisively, taking the lead in the front line of class struggle. Where the class struggle was most intense, that was their battlefield, acting both as commanders and fighters. Under the strong leadership of the revolutionary committee, the workers of Qingshan Mine launched a large-scale exposure and struggle against class enemies, exposing the ringleaders who attempted to sabotage production and thoroughly smashing the counter-revolutionary sabotage plots of a small handful of class enemies. The workers of Jiyuan Mine exposed a small group of class enemies who formed a conspiracy to sabotage the revolution and production. Various mining areas also exposed some theft gangs manipulated by landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, exposing their crimes of sabotaging and stealing state production materials. Due to the full mobilization of the masses, some deeply hidden class enemies were also exposed.

In the struggle against the enemy, revolutionary cadres at all levels deeply realized that only by relying on the masses and mobilizing the masses, actively launching a fierce offensive against class enemies, and constantly raising the class struggle awareness and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad masses, can the cause of socialist construction be continuously advanced. The facts also proved that through the struggle against the enemy, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the workers was fully unleashed, and they voluntarily shouldered the heavy burden of production. The entire mine presented a scene of fervent activity. Some mining areas affected by anarchism, workers resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's instruction to "seize the revolution and promote production," voluntarily observing labor discipline. Many old workers who had deep grievances in the old society took the lead in forming "battle groups," "strike teams," and "assault teams" to seize the revolution and promote production. Some masses who had been deceived by the enemy also saw clearly and actively joined the ranks of seizing the revolution and promoting production. Through this struggle, the ideological revolutionization of cadres was further promoted. They always put revolution in command of production, generally achieving "three carries": carrying Mao Zedong Thought down, bringing active thoughts up; carrying class struggle awareness down, bringing enemy situations up; carrying enthusiasm down, bringing production achievements up.

Deeply and Persistently Carrying Out Revolutionary Criticism, Building an Industrial Army with High Socialist Awareness

After the fierce class struggle, revolution and production achieved significant victories. The revolutionary committee of the mining bureau realized that to consolidate this victory and develop the good situation, it must lead the broad worker masses, using the invincible thought of Mao Zedong as a weapon, to deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize and overthrow the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" of the Chinese Khrushchev and his entire set of counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods, eliminate their poison, and thus forge an industrial army with high socialist awareness, and carry the political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes to the end.

"Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism and revolution. Destruction must be reasoned, and reasoning is construction. With destruction in the lead, construction is also within it." The broad worker masses, following Chairman Mao's instruction, firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, united all forces that could be united, and set up battlefields for revolutionary criticism everywhere, launching a barrage of criticism against the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, a small handful of class enemies. They exposed the counter-revolutionary nature of the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" of the Chinese Khrushchev, this great traitor of the working class, in front of the great hall where he once negotiated with comprador capitalists; in front of the martyrs' monument where the Chinese Khrushchev's implementation of the class capitulationist line led to sacrifices, they angrily denounced the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in restoring capitalism. They used Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on class and class struggle as a weapon, thoroughly exposing and eliminating the poison of revisionism spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Pingxiang Mine. Through revolutionary criticism, the broad worker masses deeply understood that only by putting proletarian politics in command of production can production be continuously developed and truly serve socialism. After severely criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents for using "material interests first" to cancel class struggle, some masses who had been deceived by counter-revolutionary economism deeply realized that counter-revolutionary economism is a soft knife that kills without blood, a poisoned sugar-coated bullet that harms workers. Once touched by it, one would lose direction and fall into the trap of class enemies. Now, "working for the revolution and being a good miner for Chairman Mao" has become the actual action of the broad worker masses. They turned class meetings into Mao Zedong Thought study sessions, everyone pledging loyalty to Chairman Mao, expressing their determination, and striving to be good workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Nowadays, walking into various mining areas, everywhere is a surging tide of learning from advanced examples, catching up with advanced examples, and striving to be advanced.

Comrade Lin Biao instructed us: "Mao Zedong Thought, when grasped by the broad masses, will become an inexhaustible force, becoming an atomic bomb of unparalleled power." Under the leadership of the newly born revolutionary committee, Pingxiang Coal Mine, through revolutionary criticism, has already demonstrated the tremendous power of a proletarian industrial army armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

A red sun shines over the coal city, Chairman Mao waves his hand, and we march forward!

Under the great news of Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin receiving the representatives of the coal mine conference on seizing the revolution and promoting production, the broad revolutionary workers of Pingxiang Coal Mine unanimously expressed that they must better take over the revolutionary tradition personally established by Chairman Mao, deeply grasp the awareness of class struggle, raise the consciousness of line struggle, and continuously attack class enemies, seize the revolution, and vigorously promote production. The miners, full of loyalty to Chairman Mao, in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, and in the place where Chairman Mao once led the workers' struggle, solemnly swore to the great leader Chairman Mao: Chairman Mao waves his hand, and we march forward! Now, in the various coal mines under the jurisdiction of Pingxiang Mining Bureau, a new high tide of the mass movement of seizing the revolution and promoting production is further surging.

    做毛主席的好矿工　夺革命生产双胜利
    萍乡矿务局革委会狠抓阶级斗争在全矿建设一支用毛泽东思想武装的产业大军
    这个局的革委会率领广大革命职工向阶级敌人猛烈进攻，粉碎了阶级敌人的反革命复辟阴谋；深入持久开展革命大批判，肃清中国赫鲁晓夫的流毒。广大革命职工朝气蓬勃，夺得抓革命促生产的重大胜利，连月提前完成国家生产计划，并创造了现有生产矿井日产量的历史最高纪录
    新华社南昌电　萍乡煤矿矿务局革命委员会，接过毛主席当年在红色安源亲手树立的革命传统，狠抓阶级斗争，率领广大革命职工向阶级敌人猛烈进攻，把暗藏的阶级敌人一个个挖出来，粉碎了他们的反革命复辟的阴谋，夺取了抓革命，促生产的重大胜利。在激烈的阶级斗争中，革命委员会得到进一步巩固，发挥了巨大威力。
    这个局的革命委员会成立后的三月份，全矿煤炭产量比二月份增长百分之十七；四月份比三月份猛增百分之十九点六二，提前两天完成国家计划；五月份又提前六天超额完成国家计划，并创造了现有生产矿井日产量的历史最高纪录。
    接过毛主席在红色安源树立的革命传统
    萍乡煤矿是伟大领袖毛主席亲手开创的工人运动策源地。早在二十年代，毛主席在这里的安源矿，同当时中国赫鲁晓夫极力推行的阶级投降主义路线针锋相对，发动工人向阶级敌人展开了前赴后继的英勇斗争。毛主席关于阶级斗争的光辉思想在萍乡煤矿扎下了深根，成了代代相传的革命传统。在无产阶级文化大革命中诞生的矿务局革命委员会，接过了这个光荣传统，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓阶级斗争，以朝气蓬勃的革命精神，带领广大革命职工向阶级敌人展开了猛烈进攻。
    革委会刚成立时，阶级敌人煽动无政府主义，严重地影响着生产。有些干部眼看生产上不去，就穿起工作服，拿起风镐、岩尖，带头下井劳动。但是，生产上的被动局面始终扭转不了。领导的责任究竟是抓挖煤的风镐，还是抓阶级斗争的风向？革委会遵照毛主席“我们应该走到群众中间去，向群众学习”的教导，组织干部到群众中去解决这个问题。他们从革命职工那里了解到大量活生生的阶级斗争事实，看到工人群众既关心生产，更关心阶级斗争。当阶级敌人在一个矿井下刮起无政府主义妖风，阴谋破坏井下排水房时，一些老工人就挺身而出，甚至连自己的家属都发动起来了。有的工人连续工作二十四小时，学会开水泵；有的天天半夜起来，查看排水情况。老工人对干部说：“阶级斗争松一松，阶级敌人就攻一攻。放松阶级斗争，就是对无产阶级革命事业最大的不忠。你们一定要牢牢记住毛主席‘千万不要忘记阶级斗争’的教导啊！”
    干部们到群众中去上了一堂生动、深刻的阶级斗争教育课以后，矿务局革委会又组织大家就“究竟是抓挖煤的风镐，还是抓阶级斗争的风向”这一问题展开大讨论，以进一步提高阶级斗争观念。讨论中，干部们首先认真学习了毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，然后联系实际，对照检查自己，一致认识到，煤矿生产同样贯穿着阶级斗争，打的就是政治仗，矿井就是阶级斗争的战场。领导的首要责任就是抓阶级斗争的“风向”，如果光抓风镐，不抓“风向”，就不能代表工人阶级的根本利益，无产阶级夺得的政权就有重新丧失的危险。在大家提高了认识以后，矿务局革委会在当年毛主席领导工人斗争的安源矿，举行了全局职工代表“接过革命传统，向阶级敌人发起猛攻”的誓师大会。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”毛主席的这一伟大指示，给了全局革命职工巨大的鼓舞和力量。当年跟随毛主席战斗过的老工人，激动地向革委会表示：毛主席发出了号令，你们就率领大家向阶级敌人勇猛进攻吧！
    发扬无产阶级的坚决彻底革命精神，不给阶级敌人以喘息的机会
    当革委会率领广大群众向阶级敌人发起猛烈攻势时，由于敌人拚死顽抗，疯狂反扑，采取更恶毒的手段破坏生产，煤炭生产任务也就更紧张。这时，有人就提出要先顾煤炭，把生产搞上去再来对付阶级敌人。革委会认为，这一活思想，实质上是对敌人进攻还是退却的问题，是坚持不坚持以阶级斗争为纲、以革命推动生产的大问题。革委会以当年毛主席领导安源工人斗争的伟大革命实践教育广大革命职工，一定要发扬无产阶级的坚决彻底革命精神，不给阶级敌人以喘息的机会。
    用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的广大革命职工，组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，稳、准、狠地坚决打击了一小撮阶级敌人。各级革命干部雷厉风行，主动站到阶级斗争的第一线。那里阶级斗争最紧张，那里就是他们的战斗岗位，既当指挥员，又当战斗员。在革委会的坚强领导下，青山矿工人群众开展对阶级敌人的大揭发、大斗争，揪出了妄图破坏生产的首恶分子，彻底粉碎了一小撮阶级敌人的反革命破坏阴谋。巨源矿的工人群众，把一个由一小撮阶级敌人组成的阴谋破坏革命和生产的小集团，也挖了出来。各矿区还挖出了一些地富反坏右分子操纵的盗窃集团，揭发了他们破坏和盗窃国家生产物资的罪行。由于广大群众充分发动起来，一些埋藏得很深的阶级敌人也被挖了出来。
    在对敌斗争中，各级革命干部深刻地认识到，只有依靠群众，发动群众，主动向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，不断提高广大群众的阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争觉悟，才能推动社会主义建设事业不断向前发展。事实也证明，通过开展对敌斗争，工人群众的革命积极性充分发挥出来，自觉地肩负起生产重担，全矿出现了一片热气腾腾的新景象。一些受无政府主义影响的矿区，工人们坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示，自觉地遵守劳动纪律。许多在旧社会苦大仇深的老工人，带头组成抓革命促生产的“战斗组”、“突击组”、“攻坚组”，曾经受敌人蒙蔽的少数群众也擦亮了眼睛，积极投入抓革命促生产的行列。通过这场斗争，进一步促进了干部的思想革命化。他们时时处处以革命统帅生产，普遍做到了“三带”：带毛泽东思想下去，带活思想上来；带阶级斗争观念下去，带敌情上来；带干劲下去，带生产成绩上来。
      持久深入地开展革命大批判，建设一支有高度社会主义觉悟的产业大军
    经过激烈的阶级大搏斗，革命和生产取得了重大的胜利。矿务局革委会认识到，要巩固这个胜利，乘胜发展大好形势，就必须率领广大工人群众，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，持久深入地开展革命大批判，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批倒中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论及其一整套反革命修正主义黑货，肃清其流毒，从而锻炼出一支具有高度社会主义觉悟的产业大军，把无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命进行到底。
    “不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。”广大工人群众遵照毛主席这一教导，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，团结一切可以团结的力量，处处摆开大批判的战场，万炮齐轰中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人等一小撮阶级敌人。他们在中国赫鲁晓夫这个工人阶级的大叛徒当年和买办资本家“和谈”的大楼前，大揭他的“阶级斗争熄灭”论的反革命本质；在由于中国赫鲁晓夫推行阶级投降主义而牺牲的烈士碑前，愤怒控诉中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。他们以毛主席关于阶级、阶级斗争的光辉思想为武器，大挖大清中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在萍矿散布的修正主义流毒。通过革命的大批判，广大工人群众都深深懂得，只有用无产阶级政治统帅生产，才能不断发展生产，并使之真正为社会主义服务。在狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人用“物质利益第一”取消阶级斗争的罪行以后，一些上了反革命经济主义当的群众深刻地认识到，反革命经济主义是杀人不见血的软刀子，是毒害工人的糖衣炮弹。沾了它的边，就会迷失方向，上阶级敌人的大当。现在，“为革命而劳动，做毛主席的好矿工”，已成为广大工人群众的实际行动。他们把进班会变成毛泽东思想学习会，大家向毛主席献忠心，表决心，一个个争做毛泽东思想武装起来的好工人。如今，走进各矿区，到处是一片学先进，比先进，赶先进的热潮。
    林副主席指示我们：“毛泽东思想为广大群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的力量，变成威力无比的精神原子弹。”萍乡煤矿在新生的革命委员会领导下，通过革命的大批判，一支用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级产业大军，已经显示出巨大的威力。
    一轮红日照煤城，毛主席挥手我前进！
    在伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席接见出席煤矿抓革命、促生产会议代表的特大喜讯鼓舞下，萍乡煤矿广大革命职工一致表示，一定要更好地接过毛主席亲手树立的革命传统，把阶级斗争观念搞得深深的，把路线斗争觉悟提得高高的，不停顿地向阶级敌人进攻，狠抓革命，猛促生产。矿工们满怀对毛主席的无限忠诚，在毛主席像前，在毛主席当年领导工人斗争的地方，向伟大领袖毛主席庄严宣誓：毛主席挥手我前进！现在，在萍乡矿务局所属的各个煤矿，进一步掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的抓革命、促生产的群众运动新高潮。
