The great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship." We have used this instruction to review and summarize our previous support-left work, deeply feeling that: the attitude towards the masses has always been the focal point of struggle in support-left work. Whether to support and protect the masses or to suppress them is the dividing line between revolution and counter-revolution, the dividing line between Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the bourgeois reactionary line, and the dividing line between the people's army and all reactionary armies.

"The revolutionary committees formed by the 'three-in-one combination' are a creation of the proletariat and the masses in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." The attitude towards the revolutionary committees is the attitude towards the masses. Over the past year, our group, under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, has firmly supported the mass representatives in the revolutionary committees, fully played their role, and enthusiastically supported their work. We have repeatedly foiled the evil plots of the class enemies to overthrow the revolutionary committees and protected the newly born revolutionary committees.

Last year at the end of the year, the revolutionary committee of this factory had just been born. The overthrown capitalist-roaders, unwilling to accept their doom, colluded with a handful of traitors, spies, and unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. They seized on some shortcomings in the work of the revolutionary committee, used anarchist thinking, created a counter-revolutionary public opinion, spread poisonous winds, and set evil fires to attack the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. They attempted to strangle the newly born revolutionary committee in its cradle. At this time, our support-left group, based on the instructions of the great helmsman Chairman Mao, used the perspective of class and class struggle to analyze the situation. We recognized that this was not just a dispute over work issues but a class struggle, a struggle over seizing and counter-seizing power. We firmly stood on the side of the broad revolutionary masses, firmly supporting and protecting the newly born revolutionary committee. We extensively propagated Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, extensively criticized the counter-revolutionary fallacies of China's Khrushchev, and extensively exposed the plots of the class enemies to overthrow the new power. This raised the consciousness of the deceived masses, overcame anarchist thinking, aroused production enthusiasm, united all possible forces, and dealt a powerful blow to a handful of class enemies.

The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is irresistible. However, a handful of class enemies, unwilling to accept their defeat, still struggle desperately. They frantically oppose the mass movement and deny the great achievements of the broad revolutionary masses.

We firmly remember the teachings of the great helmsman Chairman Mao: "Our army has always had two principles: first, be ruthless to the enemy, crush it, and annihilate it; second, be united with our own people, with the people, with comrades, with superiors, and with subordinates." We resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. For the revolutionary mass representatives, we firmly protect them, extensively propagate their great role in the revolutionary committee, and clearly point out: with them, the revolutionary committee can maintain a broader and closer connection with the masses, better represent the interests of the masses, reflect the demands of the masses, deeply root among the masses, and be subject to the supervision of the broad masses from the bottom up. This promotes the revolutionization of the leading cadre, making the leading cadre a cadre with proletarian authority, full of vigor, and with a broad mass base. At the same time, we extensively display the great achievements of the mass representatives in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We point out that anyone who maliciously attacks them is attacking the broad revolutionary masses and attacking the revolutionary committee created by the masses. Anyone who attempts to deny the immortal achievements they have made in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is denying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. For a handful of class enemies, we extensively and deeply mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, expose their plots, and implement the dictatorship of the masses, powerfully defending the revolutionary committee and consolidating the proletarian dictatorship.

Chairman Mao repeatedly teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power and consolidating power." The practice of class struggle makes us deeply realize: to support and protect the masses, we must support and protect the 'three-in-one combination' revolutionary committees created by the masses. We must support the mass representatives in the revolutionary committees and fully play their role. With the outstanding elements of the proletariat emerging from the masses directly participating in the power at all levels, the proletarian power has a solid mass base and proletarian revolutionary authority. We support and protect the people's masses, and an important aspect is to support and protect the rights obtained by the people's masses. "The rights obtained by the people must not be easily lost and must be defended with struggle." We must strive for the rights of the people's masses and, for defending the people's power and the rights of the people's masses, stand guard, stand watch, and fight well.

    人民得到的权利必须保护
    解放军驻济南机车工厂支左人员　晓祖
    伟大领袖毛主席最近指示我们：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”我们用这一指示，检查和总结了前一段支左工作，深深体会到：对待群众的态度问题，一直是支左工作中斗争的焦点，是支持、保护群众，还是打击、镇压群众，是革命同反革命的分水岭，是毛主席革命路线同资产阶级反动路线的分水岭，是人民军队同一切反动军队的分水岭。
  “‘三结合’的革命委员会，是工人阶级和人民群众在这次文化大革命中的一种创造。”对待革命委员会的态度问题，就是对待群众的态度问题。一年来，我们小组在毛主席一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下，坚决为革委会中的群众代表撑腰，充分发挥他们的作用，满腔热情地支持他们的工作，一次又一次地粉碎了阶级敌人企图颠覆革委会的罪恶阴谋，保护了新生的革命委员会。
    去年年底，这个厂的革命委员会刚刚诞生，被打倒了的走资派不甘心自己的灭亡，勾结一小撮叛徒、特务和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，抓住革委会工作中的一点缺点，利用无政府主义思潮，大造反革命舆论，煽阴风，点邪火，大肆攻击无产阶级革命派，妄图把新生的革命委员会扼杀在摇篮里。这时，我们支左小组根据伟大统帅毛主席的指示，运用阶级和阶级斗争的观点，分析了形势；认识到这绝不是什么工作问题的争论，而是阶级斗争，是夺权和反夺权之争。我们就坚决站在广大革命群众一边，坚决支持、保护新生的革命委员会。我们大讲毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，大批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命谬论，大揭阶级敌人妄图颠覆新生政权的阴谋，使受蒙蔽的群众提高了觉悟，克服了无政府主义思想，激发了生产积极性，团结了一切可以团结的力量，有力地打击了一小撮阶级敌人。
    无产阶级文化大革命群众运动的胜利是不可抗拒的。但是，一小撮阶级敌人，不甘心于他们的失败，还要进行垂死的挣扎。他们疯狂地反对群众运动，否定广大革命群众所建立的伟大功勋。
    我们牢记伟大统帅毛主席的教导：“我们的军队一向就有两条方针：第一对敌人要狠，要压倒它，要消灭它；第二对自己人、对人民、对同志、对官长、对部下要和，要团结。”坚定不移地执行毛主席的革命路线。对革命群众代表，我们坚决保护，大讲他们在革命委员会中的巨大作用，明确指出：有了他们，就能使革命委员会同群众保持更加广泛的、密切的联系，更好地代表群众利益，反映群众要求，深深扎根群众，就能使革命委员会受到广大群众自下而上的监督，促进领导班子革命化，使领导班子成为有无产阶级权威的、朝气蓬勃的、有广泛群众基础的领导班子。同时还大摆群众代表在文化大革命中的丰功伟绩。指出谁恶意攻击他们，就是攻击广大革命群众，攻击群众创造的革命委员会。谁企图否定他们在文化大革命中立下的不朽功勋，就是否定文化大革命。对一小撮阶级敌人，我们广泛深入地发动群众，依靠群众，揭穿他们的阴谋活动，实行群众专政，有力地捍卫了革命委员会，巩固了无产阶级专政。
    毛主席一再教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”阶级斗争的实践，使我们深刻地认识到：支持、保护群众，就必须支持、保护群众创造的“三结合”的革命委员会，就要为革命委员会中的群众代表撑腰，充分发挥他们的作用。有了群众中涌现出来的无产阶级的优秀分子直接参加各级政权，无产阶级政权就有了深厚的群众基础，就有了无产阶级的革命权威，我们支持、保护人民群众，很重要的就是要支持、保护人民群众得到的权利，“人民得到的权利，绝不允许轻易丧失，必须用战斗来保卫。”我们要为人民群众的权利努力奋斗，为保卫人民的政权，保卫人民群众的权利放好哨，站好岗，打好仗。
