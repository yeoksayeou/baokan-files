The revolutionary wave of criticism has swept away all the filth and dirt at Zhengzhou East Railway Station. Through this revolutionary criticism, the thoughts of Chairman Mao have been widely spread, the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has become more vigorous, revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination have been further strengthened and developed, and a handful of class enemies have been submerged in the vast ocean of people's war. Through this revolutionary criticism, the spiritual outlook of revolutionary workers has undergone fundamental changes, and their enthusiasm for revolution and production has been fully displayed. They strictly observe socialist labor discipline, launching a production drive to load and unload more and better for the revolution, ensuring that as many cars as arrive are unloaded and as much cargo as there is is loaded, guaranteeing the smooth operation of the entire station. They also find ways to tap potential, striving to load fully and efficiently. In the first five months of this year alone, they saved the country 1,270 more carriages and used scrap materials to make an electric press worth 8,000 yuan, solving a long-standing production problem.

The revolutionary wave of criticism at Zhengzhou East Railway Station was initiated under the active organization and leadership of the newly established revolutionary committee. The station's capitalist roaders had fervently promoted the revisionist goods of "money as the commander" and "material incentives" by the Chinese Khrushchev, corrupting and poisoning the workers, attempting to lead them down the wrong path of "working, earning money, and eating." After the revolutionary committee was established, a handful of stubborn capitalist roaders still tried to use these poisons to stir up the counter-revolutionary economic wind, putting pressure on the revolutionary committee. In response to this situation, the revolutionary committee organized the first battle of revolutionary criticism, fiercely exposing and criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of managing enterprises by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, fiercely exposing and criticizing the revisionist goods of "money as the commander" and "material incentives." Through extensive study, exposure, criticism, and reminiscing about bitterness and thinking of sweetness by old workers, the workers angrily said: The revisionist goods of the Chinese Khrushchev are poison coated with honey, a soft knife that kills without blood. Now, the class enemies want to stir up the counter-revolutionary economic wind again, trying to poison us with the Chinese Khrushchev's methods, making us only care about personal interests and ignore the fundamental interests of the country. We will not be fooled!

The counter-revolutionary economic wind was quickly stopped, and the revolutionary committee and the revolutionary masses further recognized the importance of continuing revolutionary criticism. From then on, work was busy and complex, but revolutionary criticism never stopped. They followed Chairman Mao's latest instructions, focusing on the key points of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents at the station, closely combining with the new situations and trends of class struggle in each period, timely organizing revolutionary criticism, and launching fierce attacks on class enemies. In January and February of this year, class enemies spread anarchist thoughts, attempting to overthrow the revolutionary committee. The revolutionary committee promptly seized this trend, fiercely exposing and criticizing the schemes of class enemies, raising the awareness of class struggle and line struggle among the workers, resisting the influence of anarchism, and foiling the schemes of class enemies. In late March, after the revolutionary committee organized all the revolutionary workers at the station to smash the counter-revolutionary rightist reversal wind, they immediately launched a fierce exposure and criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist party-building line and cadre line, cleaning up the class ranks, and carrying out struggles against enemies. So far, the station has held over 400 large and small criticism and struggle meetings, with each wave of struggle higher than the last, each layer of criticism deeper than the last, and the content richer than the last. The revolutionary criticism fire has burned a handful of class enemies, making them frantic and desperate.

Through revolutionary criticism, the class struggle and line struggle awareness of all revolutionary workers at the station has been increasingly heightened, and their enthusiasm for revolution and production has been increasingly great. The entire station presents a vibrant new scene.

    工作千忙万忙  革命大批判从不间断
    郑州铁路东站呈现一派新景象
    据新华社郑州二十五日电　革命大批判的滚滚洪流冲击着郑州铁路东站的一切污泥浊水。通过革命大批判，毛泽东思想空前大普及，活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动空前壮阔，革命的大联合、三结合更加巩固和发展，一小撮阶级敌人陷入了“人民战争”的汪洋大海之中。通过革命大批判，革命职工的精神面貌发生了根本的变化，抓革命促生产的积极性得到充分发挥。他们模范地遵守社会主义劳动纪律，掀起了为革命多装卸、装卸好的生产热潮，做到来多少车卸多少车，有多少货装多少货，保证了整个车站畅通无阻。他们还找窍门挖潜力，尽量做到巧装满载，仅今年一至五月就为国家节省了一千二百七十多辆车皮，并且利用废料制成价值八千元的电动压力机，解决了生产上的老大难问题。
    郑州铁路东站的革命大批判热潮，是在新生的革命委员会的积极组织领导下掀起来的。这个站的走资派曾经狂热地推行中国赫鲁晓夫的“金钱挂帅”、“物质刺激”等修正主义黑货，对工人进行腐蚀和毒害，妄图把工人引到“干活、挣钱、吃饭”的邪路。革委会成立后，一小撮顽固不化的走资派还想利用这种流毒，煽起反革命经济主义妖风，向革委会施加压力。针对这种情况，革委会组织革命大批判的第一个战役，就是狠揭狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的反革命修正主义办企业路线，狠揭狠批“金钱挂帅”、“物质刺激”等修正主义黑货。通过大学习、大揭发、大批判和老工人忆苦思甜，工人们愤怒地说：中国赫鲁晓夫那一套修正主义黑货，是裹着蜜糖的毒药，是杀人不见血的软刀子。现在，阶级敌人又想刮反革命经济主义妖风，妄想再用中国赫鲁晓夫的一套来毒害我们，要我们只顾眼前个人私利，不顾国家根本利益，我们决不上当！
    反革命经济主义妖风很快被刹住了，革命委员会和广大革命群众更加认识到了坚持开展革命大批判的重要意义。从此，工作千头万绪，千忙万忙，革命大批判从不间断。他们遵照毛主席的最新指示，抓住中国赫鲁晓夫及其在东站代理人的要害，密切结合每一时期阶级斗争的新形势、新动向，及时组织革命大批判，不停顿地向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻。今年一、二月间，阶级敌人散布无政府主义思想，妄图颠覆革委会。革委会及时抓住这一动向，狠揭狠批阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，提高了职工的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，抵制了无政府主义的影响，粉碎了阶级敌人的阴谋。三月下旬，革委会组织全站革命职工粉碎了阶级敌人的右倾翻案妖风后，紧接着，他们又大揭、大批中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线和干部路线，清理阶级队伍，开展对敌斗争。目前，全站已开过各种大小批判斗争会四百多次，斗争一浪高过一浪，批判一层深入一层，内容一次比一次丰富，革命大批判的怒火把一小撮阶级敌人烧得焦头烂额，狼狈不堪。
    通过革命的大批判，全站广大革命职工阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟越来越高，抓革命促生产的劲头越来越大，整个车站呈现出一派朝气勃勃的新景象。
