Revolutionary workers in coal mines follow Chairman Mao's instructions to intensify class struggle and promote production. The revolution is carried out vigorously, and coal production continues to rise. The Kailuan, Fengfeng, and Xiahuayuan coal mines have completed their first-half-year production plans ahead of schedule.

	The revolutionary workers of Kailuan Coal Mine, with the assistance of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support troops, have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, intensified the revolution, and promoted production, achieving victories in both revolution and production. Since the establishment of the revolutionary committee in Kailuan Coal Mine in January this year, the output of raw coal has increased month by month. In May and June, more than 30 million tons of raw coal were produced in excess of the plan; the state's raw coal production plan for the first half of the year was completed ahead of schedule on June 24th, achieving new victories in both revolution and production.

	After the revolutionary committee of Kailuan Coal Mine was born in the storm of class struggle, it, with the help of the People's Liberation Army soldiers stationed in the mine for leftist support, organized the establishment of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, arranged for all members to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the teachings of "never forget class struggle," and through extensive discussions of the facts of class struggle within the unit, went to the workers to listen to their opinions, participated in some grassroots units' criticism meetings, etc., to strengthen the revolutionary committee members' awareness of class struggle. After studying, the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines among the revolutionary committee members has significantly improved. They have gone deep into the masses, leading the broad revolutionary masses to intensify class struggle and carry out revolutionary criticism. Since March, all mines, workshops, teams, departments, dormitories have universally established Mao Zedong Thought study classes, using the study classes as a base to carry out revolutionary criticism, making revolutionary criticism fall to the workshops and teams, with everyone participating in criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev and his agents. Currently, revolutionary workers have focused on criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of "production first," "experts manage factories," "material incentives," and "bonus incentives" advocated by China's Khrushchev and other small cliques within the party. At the same time, the mine revolutionary committee firmly implements Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the party's series of policies, relying on the broad masses of the people, uniting all forces that can be united, and launching a fierce attack on a small number of class enemies with stability, accuracy, and ferocity. They have developed and consolidated the great alliance of the revolution and the three-in-one combination, established the revolutionary authority of the revolutionary committee, and promoted the ideological revolution of the workers. Currently, revolutionary workers voluntarily establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes, carry out self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, seize difficulties and give way in production, carry out competition and learning, help each other to produce more coal and better coal. The ancient Kailuan Coal Mine is regaining its youthful vitality, and everywhere presents a vibrant new scene.

	Xiahuayuan Coal Mine

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, June 25th

	The revolutionary committee of Xiahuayuan Coal Mine in Hebei Province, with the help of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the mine, has followed the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle," held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, intensified class struggle, carried out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, united all forces that can be united, and launched a fierce attack on a small number of class enemies with stability, accuracy, and ferocity. The class struggle and the struggle between the two lines among the broad revolutionary workers have been significantly improved, and the mine has presented a great scene of revolutionary vigor and production prosperity. Since this year, production has been overfulfilled every month, the state production plan for the first quarter was completed 13 days ahead of schedule, and the state raw coal production and tunneling plans for the first half of the year have been overfulfilled 27 days and 19 days ahead of schedule, respectively.

	After the establishment of the revolutionary committee of Xiahuayuan Coal Mine, a small number of class enemies, unwilling to accept their failure, incited anarchism among the worker masses, attempting to disrupt production and undermine the cultural revolution of the proletariat, shaking the newly born revolutionary committee.

	With the help of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the mine, the revolutionary committee of Xiahuayuan Coal Mine organized old and new cadres and responsible persons of revolutionary mass organizations to study Chairman Mao's great theories on class struggle and continuing the revolution under socialist conditions, and combined with actual situations, studied the new trends and characteristics of class struggle in the mine. Then, the standing committee members of the revolutionary committee went deep into the mine, workshops, teams, and intensively carried out class struggle. They first conducted class struggle and two-line struggle education among the broad worker masses, extensively carried out remembrance of bitterness and sweetness activities throughout the mine, invited soldiers and old workers who had deep bitterness in the old society to participate in remembrance of bitterness, set up remembrance of bitterness exhibitions, and ate remembrance of bitterness meals, greatly arousing the proletarian feelings of the broad revolutionary workers, improving their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, launching a fierce attack on a small number of class enemies, exposing the stubborn walkers of the capitalist road, traitors, spies, and unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, purifying the revolutionary ranks, and consolidating the newly born revolutionary committee.

	Chairman Mao taught us: "One of our important tasks on the ideological front now is to carry out a criticism of revisionism." After the establishment of the revolutionary committee of Xiahuayuan Coal Mine, it has always placed the leadership of revolutionary workers in carrying out revolutionary criticism in an important position. Every day, there are dozens of criticism meetings throughout the mine. From worker dormitories to worker families, from above ground to underground, from streets to courtyards, everywhere is a battlefield for revolutionary criticism.

	In launching a fierce attack on a small number of class enemies, the members of the revolutionary committee of Xiahuayuan Coal Mine paid special attention to uniting all forces that can be united, especially uniting those who had opposed themselves before the realization of the great alliance of the revolution but were proven to have made mistakes in practice. The committee members went deep into the masses, deep into the production front line, and carried out one-to-one help, one-to-one red, individual heart-to-heart talks with revolutionary workers, and at the same time, established Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Revolutionary workers in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, through self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, enhanced mutual understanding and unity. In this way, a small number of class enemies were effectively isolated and struck, and the good new order of revolution and production was continuously consolidated and developed. Revolutionary workers are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, intensify the revolution, promote production, and strive for new victories in the comprehensive victory of the cultural revolution of the proletariat.

	Fengfeng Mining Bureau

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, June 25th

	The revolutionary workers of Fengfeng Mining Bureau, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, have intensified class struggle, promoted production struggle, correctly handled the relationship between coal mining and tunneling, and made the coal production of the entire mining area present a new situation of continuous rise. Since April, the entire mining area has completed the raw coal production plan every day; the raw coal output and tunneling footage have increased significantly month by month, creating the highest daily raw coal output and daily tunneling footage records since the mine was established. The tunneling and coal mining plans for the first half of the year were overfulfilled ahead of schedule on June 9th and 23rd, respectively.

	Fengfeng Mine is one of the large coal mines in China, famous for producing high-quality coking coal. The significant increase in raw coal output and tunneling footage throughout the mining bureau is achieved in the fierce struggle between the two classes and the two lines. In March this year, the entire mining area, from the mining bureau to each mine and factory, achieved revolutionary great unity, and established a three-in-one combination revolutionary leadership team. The raw coal production has increased step by step. In this good situation, a small number of unrepentant walkers of the capitalist road within the party, remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists have become active. They blew the rightist wind of reversing cases on the one hand and poisoned production on the other, causing continuous production accidents, inciting some tunneling workers to leave their production posts, attempting to disrupt the relationship between coal mining and tunneling, and achieve the purpose of disrupting production and revolution.

	With the help of the People's Liberation Army leftist support personnel stationed in the mine, the revolutionary committees at various levels in the mining area have continuously held Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The committee members and revolutionary workers studied together Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under socialist conditions, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and its led broad revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." They deeply realized that production struggle is always interwoven with class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. The small number of walkers of the capitalist road within the party and the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries want to sabotage the cultural revolution and restore capitalism, and must also do everything possible to sabotage production. Therefore, it is necessary to use class struggle and the struggle between the two lines to lead production struggle and implement Chairman Mao's instructions to achieve both revolution and production. After the revolutionary workers' awareness was raised, under the leadership of the revolutionary committees at various levels, they, with deep class feelings of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, united all forces that can be united, launched a fierce attack on class enemies, and smashed their plots to sabotage revolution and production.

	The revolutionary committee of Fengfeng Mining Bureau and the broad revolutionary workers, in the struggle to seize the revolution and promote production, aimed at the class enemies' plots to sabotage the relationship between coal mining and tunneling, causing mining and tunneling imbalance, reasonably arranged the relationship between mining and tunneling, and did a good job in production preparation work such as mining and tunneling. Revolutionary workers bravely took on the double burden of coal mining and tunneling. For example, in Dongfanghong Mine, a small number of class enemies incited tunneling workers working on the through-hole project to leave their production posts, bringing great difficulties to the production preparation work. The revolutionary vanguard of the proletariat in this mine bravely faced the difficulties. They guarded their production posts day and night and finally completed the project on schedule.

    广大革命职工听毛主席的话狠抓阶级斗争以革命带动生产
    革命搞得轰轰烈烈　煤炭生产逐月上升
    开滦、峰峰和下花园煤矿提前完成上半年生产计划开滦煤矿
    新华社石家庄二十六日电　开滦煤矿广大革命职工，在人民解放军支左部队的帮助下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓革命，猛促生产，取得了革命、生产双胜利。今年一月份开滦煤矿建立革命委员会以来，原煤产量逐月上升，五、六两个月就比计划增产原煤三十多万吨；上半年的国家原煤生产计划已提前在六月二十四日完成，取得了革命和生产的新胜利。
    开滦煤矿革命委员会在阶级斗争的暴风雨中诞生以后，就在驻矿支左的人民解放军指战员的帮助下，大办毛泽东思想学习班，组织全体成员学习毛主席的最新指示和“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，并且通过大摆本单位阶级斗争的事实，到工人中去听取意见，参加一些基层单位召开的批判会等，来加强革委会成员的阶级斗争观念。经过学习，革命委员会的成员阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟有很大提高，他们纷纷深入到群众中去，带领广大革命群众大抓阶级斗争，开展革命大批判。从三月份起，各矿厂、车间、班组、科室、宿舍都普遍办起毛泽东思想学习班，以学习班为阵地开展革命大批判，使革命大批判落实到车间、班组，人人动口动手批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的反革命修正主义路线。目前，革命职工已经重点批判了中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派的“生产第一”、“专家办厂”、“物质刺激”、“奖金挂帅”等反革命修正主义谬论。同时，矿革命委员会坚决贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示和党的一系列方针政策，依靠广大人民群众，团结一切可以团结的力量，稳、准、狠地向一小撮阶级敌人发动了猛烈的进攻，发展和巩固了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，树立了革命委员会的无产阶级革命权威，促进了职工的思想革命化。目前，广大革命职工自觉地大办毛泽东思想学习班，开展斗私批修，在生产上抢困难，让方便，开展比、学、赶、帮竞赛，多出煤，出好煤。古老的开滦煤矿正焕发出青春的活力，到处呈现一片热气腾腾的新景象。下花园煤矿
    据新华社石家庄二十五日电　河北省下花园煤矿革命委员会，在驻矿人民解放军的帮助下，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命的大批判，团结一切可以团结的人，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，提高了广大革命职工的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，全矿出现了革命轰轰烈烈，生产蒸蒸日上的大好景象。今年以来月月超产，第一季度提前十三天完成国家生产计划，上半年国家原煤产量计划和掘进计划已经分别提前二十七天和十九天超额完成。
    下花园煤矿革命委员会成立后，一小撮阶级敌人不甘心于他们的失败，在职工群众中煽动无政府主义，妄图以破坏生产来破坏无产阶级文化大革命，动摇新生的革命委员会。
    下花园煤矿革委会在驻矿解放军的帮助下，组织新老干部以及革命群众组织的负责人学习毛主席关于阶级斗争和在社会主义条件下继续进行革命的伟大理论，并结合实际，研究了本矿阶级斗争的新动向、新特点。然后，革命委员会常委都深入到矿井、工区、班组，狠抓阶级斗争。他们首先向广大职工群众进行阶级斗争和两条路线斗争教育，在全矿范围内广泛开展忆苦思甜活动，邀请在旧社会苦大仇深的解放军同志和老工人进行忆苦思甜、办忆苦展览会、吃忆苦饭，大大激发了广大革命职工的无产阶级感情，提高了他们的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，向一小撮阶级敌人发动了猛烈进攻，揪出了在背后煽阴风，点鬼火，煽动无政府主义，大搞右倾翻案活动的顽固不化的走资派、叛徒、特务和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，纯洁了革命队伍，巩固了新生的革命委员会。
    毛主席教导我们说：“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判。”下花园煤矿革命委员会成立后，始终把带领革命职工开展革命大批判放在重要地位，全矿每天都有十几场、几十场批判会。由职工宿舍到职工家庭，由井上到井下，由街头到院落，处处都是革命大批判的战场。
    在向一小撮阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻中，下花园煤矿革命委员会成员非常注意团结一切可以团结的力量，特别注意团结那些在实现革命大联合以前曾经反对过自己而被实践证明是犯了错误的同志。革委会的成员深入群众，深入生产第一线，和革命职工开展一帮一、一对红、个别谈心等活动，同时大办毛泽东思想学习班。革命职工们在毛泽东思想学习班上，以毛泽东思想为武器，通过斗私批修，增强了彼此之间的团结和了解。这样，就有力地孤立和打击了一小撮阶级敌人，良好的革命、生产新秩序得到了不断的巩固和发展。广大革命职工决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓革命，猛促生产，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利立新功。峰峰矿务局
    据新华社石家庄二十五日电　峰峰矿务局广大革命职工在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，狠抓阶级斗争，促进生产斗争，正确处理采煤和掘进的关系，使全矿区煤炭生产出现持续上升的崭新局面。从四月份以来，全矿区天天完成原煤生产计划；原煤产量和掘进进尺逐月大幅度上升，连续创造了建矿以来原煤日产量和掘进日进尺的最高纪录。全矿今年上半年的掘进和采煤计划，分别提前在六月九日和二十三日超额完成。
    峰峰矿是我国大型煤矿之一，以盛产优质炼焦煤著称。全矿务局原煤产量和掘进进尺双双大幅度上升，是在两个阶级、两条路线的激烈斗争中取得的。今年三月，全矿区从矿务局到各矿、厂，全部实现了革命的大联合，建立了三结合的革命领导班子，原煤生产节节上升。在这大好形势下，党内一小撮死不悔改的走资派、国民党反动派的残渣余孽和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子活动频繁。他们一方面刮起右倾翻案妖风，一方面在生产上下毒手，连续制造生产事故，煽动一些掘进工人离开生产岗位，妄图使采煤、掘进的关系失调，以达到破坏生产、破坏革命的目的。
    矿区各级革命委员会在驻矿人民解放军支左人员的帮助下，连续举办了毛泽东思想学习班。革委会成员和革命职工一起学习毛主席的最新指示：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”他们深刻地认识到，生产斗争中始终贯穿着阶级斗争和两条路线斗争。党内一小撮走资派等国民党反动派的残渣余孽要破坏文化大革命，复辟资本主义，必然同时千方百计地破坏生产。因此，必须以阶级斗争和两条路线斗争来统帅生产斗争，切实贯彻执行毛主席的指示，做到抓革命，促生产。广大革命职工认识提高以后，在各级革委会的领导下，怀着无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席革命路线的深厚阶级感情，团结一切可以团结的力量，向阶级敌人展开猛烈进攻，粉碎了他们破坏革命和生产的阴谋。
    峰峰矿务局革委会和广大革命职工在抓革命、促生产的斗争中，针对阶级敌人破坏开拓、掘进和采煤的关系，制造采、掘失调的阴谋，合理地安排采、掘关系，搞好开拓、掘进等生产准备工作。广大革命职工勇敢地挑起了采煤、掘进两副重担。例如，东方红矿一小撮阶级敌人煽动正在搞贯通石门工程的开拓工人离开生产岗位，给生产准备工作带来极大困难。这个矿的无产阶级革命派便迎难而上。他们昼夜坚守生产岗位，终于按计划完成了这项工程。
