Upholding the banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought, the Shanghai County Revolutionary Committee has led the revolutionary masses of the entire county in an unrelenting attack on the class enemy. The industrial area of San Tiao Shi in Tianjin has leveraged the role of revolutionary veteran workers, making the revolutionary criticism precise and thorough.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Shanghai on the 9th, the Shanghai suburban Shanghai County Revolutionary Committee has upheld the banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought. Starting from the actual class struggle in the region, it has closely integrated revolutionary criticism with the deepening of the struggle against the class enemy. By promoting revolutionary criticism, it has deepened the struggle against the enemy, and by deepening the struggle against the enemy, it has promoted revolutionary criticism. The entire county has seen a situation where countless troops are pursuing the fleeing enemy.

Since its establishment, the Shanghai County Revolutionary Committee has firmly grasped the initiative in class struggle. Using the weapon of revolutionary criticism, it has led the revolutionary masses of the entire county in an unrelenting attack on the class enemy. From the county to the commune, from the brigade to the production team, from urban areas to rural areas, from government agencies to various grassroots units, revolutionary criticism battlefields have been set up everywhere, and a net to encircle the class enemy has been cast. Since the establishment of the county revolutionary committee, the achievements in the struggle against the enemy have been brilliant: a batch of deeply hidden spies, traitors, and counter-revolutionaries have been unearthed; a handful of landlords and rich peasants with heinous crimes who had fled have been captured; the rightist reversal wind stirred up by the class enemy has been smashed, and the newly born revolutionary committee has been consolidated; the old ideas of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes have been further criticized; Mao Zedong Thought has been further popularized, and the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary masses have been greatly enhanced, and socialist morale has been greatly promoted.

The main experiences of the Shanghai County Revolutionary Committee in mobilizing the masses to promote the struggle against the enemy through revolutionary criticism are as follows:

(1) Using revolutionary criticism as a sharp weapon to attack the class enemy, and continuously implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions in the struggle against the enemy to dig out hidden class enemies.

Under the leadership of the county revolutionary committee, the entire county, from top to bottom, has held Mao Zedong Thought study classes layer by layer, organizing the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's theory of class struggle, especially Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution under the conditions of socialism, a revolution by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its led revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." In the study classes, the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres use Chairman Mao's latest instructions to compare with the actual situation of their region and unit, to extensively discuss the class struggle situation, to extensively expose the sabotage activities of the class enemy, to extensively uncover the cover of class struggle, to extensively criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods promoted by China's Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai. Revolutionary criticism has aroused the strong hatred of the broad revolutionary masses towards the class enemy, strengthened the awareness of the enemy situation, and enhanced political sensitivity. They seize the slightest traces of the class enemy's sabotage activities, track and strike, and have unearthed a batch of deeply hidden remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, achieving new victories in the struggle against the enemy.

(2) Using the unearthed class enemies as "live targets" to criticize, using their reactionary words and deeds as negative teaching materials, closely integrating the criticism with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own units, and deeply and persistently carrying it out. The commonly adopted practice is: to link the crimes of the class enemies in their region and unit with China's Khrushchev, the chief culprit, to learn one instruction from the highest authority, to criticize one reactionary fallacy, to eliminate one aspect of poison, to clarify one major issue, and to criticize one major issue. As a result, the revolutionary criticism movement in the entire county has been carried out both vigorously and solidly, dealing a fatal blow to the counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by China's Khrushchev. The broad revolutionary masses say: with the "live target," the black roots of the class enemy's evil activities have been found. Now it is very clear that China's Khrushchev and this group of bad guys are wearing the same black pants, singing the same black tune, and walking the same black path. They say: such criticism has a clear direction, strong firepower, accurate target, and every shot hits China's Khrushchev.

(3) While intensifying the struggle against the enemy, fiercely attacking the old ideas of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, raising various issues with ideological tendencies in daily life to the height of the struggle between the two lines, combining the criticism of revisionism with the struggle against selfishness, and continuously raising the consciousness of the revolutionary masses in the struggle between the two lines in revolutionary criticism.

The facts of class struggle in Shanghai County show: the revisionist black goods spread by China's Khrushchev and his agents in the countryside are widely poisonous and deeply influential. The class enemy is precisely using the old ideas in people's minds to stir up trouble, peddle black goods, and compete with us for the leadership of the ideological battlefield. The county revolutionary committee has analyzed this characteristic and firmly believes: not only should the broad revolutionary masses be led to launch a major offensive against the class enemy, but also a major offensive against the bourgeois ideology and the old ideas of all exploiting classes. It is necessary to grasp various issues with ideological tendencies, grasp the living thoughts of the people, and carry out a major criticism of bourgeois ideology and the capitalist road. Only in this way can the poison of revisionism spread by China's Khrushchev be eliminated, the dominance of the proletariat in the ideological battlefield be consolidated, and the broad revolutionary masses consciously defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and resolutely walk the socialist road.

After clarifying this guiding ideology, the county revolutionary committee led the broad revolutionary masses to start from the major issues of the two lines, grasp thoughts, grasp seeds, grasp tendencies, and carried out revolutionary criticism more extensively and deeply. Their practices can be summarized as four "transparencies": seeing the general through the particular, seeing the essence through the phenomenon, seeing the big principles through small matters involving major issues, and seeing the line through the thought. In Tangwan Commune's Xinjian Brigade, when implementing the national grain crop planting area plan, a big debate occurred: some cadres and commune members only cared about increasing the economic income of the brigade, disregarding the national plan, and blindly expanding the planting area of watermelons and muskmelons; the majority of cadres and commune members felt that this practice was to seek local and immediate interests, damaging overall and long-term interests, and expressed opposition. The brigade party branch discovered this matter, believing it to be a major issue, indicating that the poison of revisionism spread by China's Khrushchev had not been eliminated. Therefore, they seized this living fact, mobilized the masses, and conducted a thorough criticism of China's Khrushchev's revisionist black goods of "economic leadership" in various production teams. Through the criticism, cadres and commune members realized that whether to implement the national plan is a major issue of whether to walk the socialist road or the capitalist road. They said: the black goods of "economic leadership" advocated by China's Khrushchev are sugar-coated bullets, bloodless killers, and soft knives, intending to lead us to the capitalist road, and we must not fall for it! After the masses' awareness was raised, they unanimously decided to change all the seventy-two mu of watermelons and muskmelons planted to rice. The county revolutionary committee promptly summarized their experience and convened a telephone conference to introduce and promote it throughout the county.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Tianjin on the 9th, more than sixty factories in the San Tiao Shi industrial area of Tianjin's Hongqiao District have used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, fully leveraging the role of revolutionary veteran workers, and extensively and deeply carrying out revolutionary criticism. The revolutionary criticism in the San Tiao Shi industrial area has been carried out vigorously and has achieved good experiences.

The San Tiao Shi industrial area in Tianjin has a powerful fighting force composed of veteran workers who have suffered deeply and been oppressed heavily in the old society. These revolutionary veteran workers often go to various factories, rural areas, government agencies, and military units in the city to give bitter struggle reports. In the past half year, many of them have each given hundreds of lectures, and hundreds of thousands of people have listened to their reports. The revolutionary criticism team composed of San Tiao Shi veteran workers has ignited the revolutionary criticism fire wherever they go, achieving strong firepower, precise strikes, deep and thorough criticism.

The main experiences of carrying out revolutionary criticism in the San Tiao Shi industrial area are:

1. Relying on and cultivating the backbone forces, leading the broad revolutionary masses to deeply carry out revolutionary criticism.

The revolutionary veteran workers of San Tiao Shi have suffered the most and been oppressed the heaviest in the old society. Each of them has a tragic history of blood and tears and a book of today's comparison with the past. Their personal experiences are good teaching materials for class education for workers and the most powerful indictment for exposing and criticizing China's Khrushchev. Therefore, the left-supporting troops stationed in the San Tiao Shi industrial area have always paid attention to leveraging the role of these revolutionary veteran workers, letting them take the lead in charging and fighting in revolutionary criticism. At the same time, to continuously improve their class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness and improve the quality of revolutionary criticism, they have also planned and step-by-step cultivated and trained them. In May, the San Tiao Shi industrial area held a Mao Zedong Thought study class, selecting old workers with high two-line struggle consciousness and critical abilities from various factories, outstanding proletarian political young workers with writing abilities, and revolutionary committee members in charge of revolutionary criticism, totaling 376 people, for short-term concentrated study. The study class adopted the method of "fighting as training" and "practicing in real battles" for cultivation and training. After the study class ended, this backbone force returned to the factories and set up revolutionary criticism study classes in their respective factories, further cultivating and organizing more backbone forces. Currently, the entire area has a revolutionary criticism backbone force of more than a thousand people.

2. Adopting various methods, being flexible and mobile, and deeply carrying out revolutionary criticism.

The San Tiao Shi industrial area has used the unearthed class enemies with heinous crimes as "live targets" for combined exposure, criticism, and struggle. In addition, they have held exhibitions of the class enemies' crime evidence and contraband, organizing the masses to visit, explaining, accusing, and criticizing. Recently, to mobilize the masses more extensively, they have adopted the method of short-range face-to-face revolutionary criticism with the workshop as the starting point. They have also adopted the method of thematic criticism. They have classified the crimes of a handful of walkers within the party and spies and traitors in the entire area and matched these problems with various counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies spread by China's Khrushchev, criticizing them by problems, which can be criticized deeply and thoroughly. The exhibition of the class enemies' crime evidence and contraband has now developed from being held by the industrial area to being held by various factories; from large fixed exhibitions to small mobile exhibitions, and directly sent to the workshops for workers to criticize. The broad revolutionary workers reflected: this criticism can powerfully overthrow the class enemy and is also a vivid and profound class struggle education class.

3. Continuously studying the new trends, new characteristics, and new problems of class struggle, firmly grasping the initiative of class struggle, and deeply carrying out revolutionary criticism.

After a period of struggle against the enemy, the San Tiao Shi industrial area has launched a new high tide of revolutionary criticism. The cunning class enemy has temporarily restrained themselves on the surface. Some masses have therefore become complacent and relaxed. The left-supporting troops, in response to this problem, organized the revolutionary committees of various factories to review Chairman Mao's teachings: "Class struggle has not ended. The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between various political forces, and the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological field are still long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very intense." Many members of the revolutionary committees, with the help of the PLA, have conducted in-depth investigations and research in the places where class struggle is the most acute and complex, grasping the new trends of class struggle, and mobilizing the masses to organize new battles. Members of the revolutionary committee of the Tianjin Balance Instrument Factory conducted investigations and research in various workshops and found that the reactionary capitalists who had been struggled against in the small groups still had new and more hidden sabotage activities. Therefore, they immediately organized new battles, exposed the crimes of the reactionary capitalists, and powerfully criticized China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacy of attempting to abolish the dictatorship of the proletariat. The broad revolutionary masses have further realized that revolutionary criticism must be a protracted war, criticizing every day and continuously, thoroughly criticizing and exposing the class enemy.

As the revolutionary criticism gradually deepens, the spiritual outlook of the broad revolutionary masses in the San Tiao Shi industrial area of Tianjin has undergone tremendous changes. The production level in the first five months of this year has been rising month by month. The broad revolutionary workers have also strongly criticized the reactionary technical "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, carried out technical innovation and technological revolution, and launched a new high tide of seizing revolution and promoting production.

    狠抓革命大批判深入开展对敌斗争
    上海县革委会带领全县革命群众不停顿地向阶级敌人猛烈进攻
    天津三条石工业片发挥革命老工人骨干作用，革命大批判打得准批得透
    据新华社上海九日电　上海郊区上海县革命委员会高举毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，从本地区的阶级斗争实际出发，把革命大批判同深入开展对阶级敌人的斗争紧密结合起来，以大批判推动对敌斗争深入开展，以深入开展对敌斗争促进大批判，全县出现了一个千军万马追穷寇的大好形势。
    上海县革命委员会在成立以来的三个月里，一直牢牢地掌握阶级斗争的主动权，运用革命大批判的武器，带领全县革命群众不停顿地向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻。从县、公社到大队、生产队，从城镇到农村，从机关到各个基层单位，到处摆开了革命大批判的战场，撒下了围歼阶级敌人的天罗地网。县革委会成立以来，对敌斗争战果辉煌：挖出了一批隐藏较深的特务、叛徒、反革命分子；揪回了一小撮罪恶累累、潜逃在外的地主和富农分子；粉碎了阶级敌人刮起的右倾翻案妖风，巩固了新生的革命委员会；资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的旧思想进一步受到了批判；毛泽东思想进一步大普及，广大革命群众的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟大提高，社会主义正气大发扬。
    上海县革命委员会发动群众以革命大批判推动对敌斗争深入开展的主要经验，有以下三条：
    （一）把革命大批判作为向阶级敌人进攻的锐利武器，在对敌斗争中不断落实毛主席的最新指示，大挖隐藏的阶级敌人。
    在县革命委员会的领导下，全县从上到下，层层举办毛泽东思想学习班，组织广大革命群众和革命干部反复学习毛主席的阶级斗争学说，特别是毛主席的最新指示：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”在学习班上，广大革命群众和革命干部用毛主席的最新指示，对照本地区、本单位的实际状况，大议阶级斗争形势，大摆阶级敌人的破坏活动，大揭阶级斗争盖子，大批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在上海代理人所推行的反革命修正主义黑货。革命的大批判使广大革命群众激起了对阶级敌人的强烈仇恨，加强了敌情观念，提高了政治嗅觉。他们抓住阶级敌人破坏活动的蛛丝马迹，跟踪追击，揪出了一批隐藏得较深的国民党反动派的残渣余孽，取得了对敌斗争的新胜利。
    （二）把挖出的阶级敌人作为“活靶子”打，把他们的反动言行作为反面教材批，使大批判和本单位斗批改紧密结合起来，深入持久地开展下去。普遍采用的做法是：把本地区、本单位阶级敌人的一桩桩罪行、一句句黑话，都同中国赫鲁晓夫这个罪魁祸首挂上钩，抓住一个“活靶”，学习一条最高指示，批判一个反动谬论，肃清一个方面的流毒，弄清一个大是大非问题。这样做的结果，全县革命大批判运动开展得既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实，使中国赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义路线，受到了致命的打击。广大革命群众说：大批判有了“活靶子”，就找到了阶级敌人罪恶活动的黑根子。现在看得很清楚，中国赫鲁晓夫同这伙坏蛋穿的是一条黑裤子，唱的是一个黑调子，走的是一条黑路子。他们说：这样的大批判，方向明，火力猛，目标准，炮炮都能在中国赫鲁晓夫身上大开花。
    （三）在狠抓对敌斗争的同时，对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的旧思想猛烈开火，把日常生活各个领域里带有大是大非的倾向性问题，提到两条路线斗争的高度来认识，把批修和斗私结合起来，在革命大批判中不断提高革命群众两条路线斗争的觉悟。
    上海县阶级斗争的事实表明：中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在农村中散布的修正主义黑货，流毒很广，影响很深。阶级敌人正是利用人们头脑中的旧思想来兴风作浪，推销黑货，同我们争夺思想阵地的领导权的。县革命委员会分析了这个特点，坚定地认为：不仅要带领广大革命群众向阶级敌人发动大进攻，而且要向资产阶级思想和一切剥削阶级的旧思想发动大进攻。要抓住各种带有大是大非的倾向性的问题，抓住人们的活思想，对资产阶级思想、资本主义道路开展大批判。只有这样，才能肃清中国赫鲁晓夫散布的修正主义流毒，巩固无产阶级在思想阵地的统治地位，使广大革命群众自觉地捍卫毛主席的革命路线，坚决地走社会主义道路。
    明确了这一指导思想后，县革委会引导广大革命群众从两条路线的大是大非出发，抓思想、抓苗子、抓倾向，更加广泛和深入地展开了革命大批判。他们的做法可以概括为四个“透过”：透过个别看一般，透过现象看本质，透过属于大是大非的小事情看大道理，透过思想看路线。这个县的塘湾公社新建大队，在落实国家下达的粮食作物种植面积计划的时候，发生了这样一场大辩论：有的干部和社员只顾队里增加经济收入，不顾国家计划，盲目扩大西瓜、甜瓜的种植面积；大多数干部和社员觉得这种做法是顾了局部、眼前的利益，损害了全局、长远的利益，表示反对。大队党支部发现这件事，认为这是一个大是大非的问题，说明中国赫鲁晓夫散布的修正主义毒素还没有肃清。于是，就抓住这一活的事实，发动群众，就扩大瓜田种植面积问题，在各生产队狠批中国赫鲁晓夫“经济挂帅”的修正主义黑货。通过大批判，干部和社员认识到，执行不执行国家计划，是走社会主义道路，还是走资本主义道路的大问题。他们说：中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“经济挂帅”这个黑货，是糖衣包着的炮弹，是杀人不见血的软刀子，是想把我们引向资本主义道路，我们决不能上他的当！群众觉悟提高以后，一致决定把多种的七十二亩西瓜、甜瓜，全部改种了水稻。县革命委员会及时总结了他们的经验，并且召开电话会议向全县介绍推广。
    据新华社天津九日电　天津市红桥区三条石工业片六十多个工厂，以毛泽东思想为武器，充分发挥革命老工人的骨干作用，广泛而深入地开展革命大批判。三条石工业片的革命大批判搞得轰轰烈烈，并取得了较好的经验。
    天津市三条石工业片有一支由苦大仇深的老工人组成的强大的战斗队伍。这些革命老工人经常到全市各工厂、农村、机关和部队去作忆苦报告。半年多来，他们中间的许多人各自讲了上百次的课，有数十万人听了他们的报告。三条石老工人组成的革命大批判的队伍，走到那里，就把那里革命大批判的烈火烧得更旺，做到了火力猛、打得准、批得深、批得透。
    三条石工业片开展革命大批判的主要经验是：
    一、依靠和培养骨干力量，带领广大革命群众，深入开展革命大批判。
    三条石革命老工人，在旧社会受苦最深，受压迫最重，他们每人都有一部悲惨的血泪史，一本苦尽甜来的今昔对比账。他们的亲身经历，是对工人进行阶级教育的好教材，是对中国赫鲁晓夫进行揭发批判的最有力的控诉书。因而驻三条石工业片的支左部队始终注意发挥这些革命老工人的骨干作用，让他们在革命大批判中带头冲锋陷阵。同时，为了不断地提高他们的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，提高革命大批判的质量，还有计划有步骤地对他们进行培养和训练。今年五月份，三条石工业片举办了毛泽东思想学习班，从各厂抽调了路线斗争觉悟高、有批判能力的老工人和突出无产阶级政治的、有写作能力的青年工人，以及革委会分管革命大批判的委员共三百七十六人，进行短期的集中学习。学习班采取“以战代训”、“实战练兵”的办法，进行培养和训练。学习班结束后，这支骨干队伍回到工厂，纷纷办起本厂的革命大批判学习班，进一步培养和组织起更多的骨干力量。目前全片已有一支上千名的革命大批判骨干队伍。
    二、采取多种办法，机动灵活，深入开展革命大批判。
    三条石工业片把揪出的罪恶累累的阶级敌人，做为“活靶子”，进行揭、批、斗相结合的大批判；另外，还举办阶级敌人罪证赃物展览会，组织群众参观，边讲解、边控诉、边批判。最近，为了更广泛地发动群众，开展以班组为基点的短兵相接的革命大批判，还采取专题批判的方式。他们把全片党内一小撮走资派和特务、叛徒的反革命罪行，按问题分了类，并把这些问题和中国赫鲁晓夫所散布的各种反革命修正主义谬论对上号，按问题进行批判，这样能批得深、批得透。阶级敌人罪证赃物展览会，现在由工业片办发展到各厂自己办；由大型固定展览发展到小型巡回流动展览，并直接送到班组，供工人批判。广大革命工人反映：这种批判既能有力地斗倒阶级敌人，又是一堂生动、深刻的阶级斗争教育课。
    三、不断研究阶级斗争的新动向、新特点、新问题，牢牢掌握阶级斗争的主动权，深入开展革命大批判。
    三条石工业片经过一段对敌斗争，掀起革命大批判的新高潮以后，狡猾的阶级敌人表面上有所收敛。有些群众因此产生了麻痹松劲情绪。支左部队针对这一问题，就组织各厂革委会重温毛主席的教导：“阶级斗争并没有结束。无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，各派政治力量之间的阶级斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。”许多革委会成员在解放军的帮助下，纷纷深入到阶级斗争最尖锐、最复杂的地方进行调查研究，摸清阶级斗争的新动向，发动群众组织新战役。天津市衡器厂革委会委员分别深入到班组进行调查研究，发现在小组内被批斗过的反动资本家，仍然有新的更隐蔽的破坏活动，于是，他们立即组织新的战斗，揭露了反动资本家的罪行，还有力地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫妄图取消无产阶级专政的反革命修正主义谬论。广大革命群众进一步认识到，革命大批判一定要打持久战，要天天批，不断批，把阶级敌人彻底批倒批臭。
    随着革命大批判的逐步深入，天津市三条石工业片广大革命群众的精神面貌发生了巨大变化，今年头五个月的生产水平逐月上升。广大革命工人还大造资产阶级反动技术“权威”的反，大搞技术革新和技术革命，掀起了一个抓革命、促生产的新高潮。
