Chairman Mao, our hearts are with you!

— Stories of Foreign Revolutionary Youth's Love for Chairman Mao

"My greatest wish is to one day shake Chairman Mao's hand. At that time, I will personally tell Chairman Mao that I love him more than anyone else. I hope this dream will come true one day." This is the wish expressed by Belgian youth Uribo in a letter to his Chinese friends.

Uribo loves Chairman Mao and studies Chairman Mao's works diligently. For a long time, he has persisted in studying the Quotations from Chairman Mao. When he received the French edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" sent by his Chinese friends, he immediately opened the package and read through "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society." In one of his letters, Uribo praises Chairman Mao as the great leader of the world's revolutionary people. Chairman Mao tells the oppressed people and nations that they are bullied by a handful of imperialist rascals and that they must rebel, take up arms, and oppose imperialism and oppressors.

Uribo often propagates Mao Zedong Thought among his classmates. The reactionary school authorities once expelled him, but he did not yield and continued to study and propagate Mao Zedong Thought. Uribo specially drew a Chinese national flag and cut out a picture of Chairman Mao from a Chinese newspaper, hanging it in his bedroom so that he could see Chairman Mao every day.

Chairman Mao, you are the red sun in the hearts of the world's revolutionary people and revolutionary youth! Revolutionary youth from various countries, like sunflowers facing the morning sun, turn their hearts towards the great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao. Uribo's letter expresses the feelings and wishes of countless revolutionary youth.

A thirteen-year-old Japanese youth named Kobukawa decided to self-study Chinese to understand the situation in New China. The first Chinese character he learned was the most brilliant one: Mao Zedong. Kobukawa also specially drew a portrait of Chairman Mao and, imitating Chairman Mao's handwriting, wrote Chairman Mao's name under the portrait, sending it with a letter to his Chinese friends. He said in the letter: I love Chairman Mao very much.

Tanzanian youth Ismail longed to see Chairman Mao. Every time he saw a car from the Chinese Embassy in Tanzania, he would try to get closer to the car to see the portrait of Chairman Mao hanging on the car window more clearly. He said, I want to carefully look at the photograph of our great sun, Chairman Mao. Ismail wrote in a letter to his Chinese friends, I especially love the great teacher Chairman Mao Zedong. How I wish I could shake the hand of the great Chairman Mao Zedong!

Rumi, a thirteen-year-old Pioneer from the "One Hand Holding a Pickaxe, One Hand Holding a Gun" amateur art troupe in Tirana, Albania, once visited China with the art troupe. She told Chinese comrades, I often dream of Chairman Mao. This time I came to China, I must see Chairman Mao. On October 1, 1967, the art troupe was invited to the reviewing stand in front of Tiananmen to watch the celebration. Rumi several times ran to one end of the reviewing stand, looking up at Tiananmen, but she did not see Chairman Mao clearly, and she cried. On October 7, Rumi's wish was fulfilled, and the happiest moment finally arrived. Our great leader Chairman Mao received the entire art troupe. The Albanian comrades were so excited and moved! Rumi jumped and danced that day, with tears of joy on her face, warmly embracing Chinese comrades. She said, this is the most unforgettable day of her life.

"We sing, we cheer, the magnificent red sun—Mao Zedong! Our voices soar into the vast sky, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought enters our hearts!" This is a passionate poem written by a little Vietnamese friend in a letter. Vietnamese children, every time they see Chinese comrades visiting Vietnam, always ask the Chinese uncles to give them Chairman Mao badges and ask the Chinese uncles to teach them to sing "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman." They said, Uncle Ho taught us that Vietnam and China are comrades and brothers. We love Chairman Mao.

A Polish youth also sent a letter to his Chinese friends, with two bright red five-pointed stars cut from shiny paper pasted on the letter, and carefully wrote in Chinese the most brilliant name: Mao Zedong. In another letter, he drew a radiant five-pointed star with a red pen. He wrote in the letter, I love Mao Zedong very much. Chairman Mao is a great leader and commander. He also wrote on the letter a quotation from Chairman Mao: "The world belongs to you."

    毛主席啊，我们的心向着您！
    ——各国革命青少年热爱毛主席的故事
    “我最大的希望就是有一天能握着毛主席的手。那时，我要亲口对毛主席说我热爱他胜于一切人。我希望这个理想有一天会实现。”这是比利时少年乌里波斯给中国朋友的一封信中表达的心愿。
    乌里波斯热爱毛主席，学习毛主席著作很认真，长时期以来他坚持学习毛主席语录。当他收到中国朋友寄给他的法文版《毛泽东选集》时，他马上打开邮包，立即读完了《中国社会各阶级的分析》。乌里波斯在他的一封来信中歌颂毛主席是世界革命人民的伟大领袖。毛主席告诉被压迫人民和被压迫民族，他们被一小撮帝国主义坏蛋所欺侮，要起来造反，拿起武器，反对帝国主义和压迫者。
    乌里波斯经常向同学宣传毛泽东思想。反动的学校当局曾经把他开除，可是他不屈服，还是照样学习和宣传毛泽东思想。乌里波斯特地精心地画了一面中国国旗，并且从中国报刊上剪下毛主席像，挂在他的卧室里，使自己每天都能见到毛主席。
    毛主席啊，您是世界革命人民和革命青少年心中的红太阳！各国革命青少年象朝阳的朵朵葵花，心向着无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席。乌里波斯的来信，表达了许许多多革命青少年的感情和心愿。
    日本一位叫户川的十三岁少年，下定决心要自学中文，以便了解新中国的情况。他首先学的中国字是世界上最光辉的字：毛泽东。户川还特地绘制了一幅毛主席像，并且模仿毛主席的笔迹，在画像下面写下毛主席的名字，随信寄给中国朋友。他在信中说：我十分热爱毛主席。
    坦桑尼亚少年伊斯马伊尔非常想念毛主席。他每次遇上中国驻坦桑尼亚使馆的汽车，总是设法靠汽车更近些，好更清楚地看到挂在汽车玻璃上的毛主席像。他说，我要细细看看我们伟大的太阳毛主席的照片。伊斯马伊尔在给中国朋友的来信中说，我特别爱伟大的导师毛泽东主席。我多么希望握到伟大的毛泽东主席的手啊！
    阿尔巴尼亚地拉那“一手拿镐，一手拿枪”业余艺术团的十三岁少先队员鲁米，曾随同艺术团来中国访问。她对中国同志说，我常常梦见毛主席，这回我来中国，一定要见到毛主席。去年十月一日那天，艺术团的同志们被邀请到天安门前的观礼台观礼，鲁米几次跑到观礼台的一头，仰望着天安门，但没有看清毛主席，直急得哭了起来。十月七日，鲁米的心愿实现了，最幸福的时刻终于到来了。我们伟大领袖毛主席接见了艺术团全体同志。阿尔巴尼亚战友多么兴奋，多么激动啊！鲁米这一天又蹦又跳，脸上挂着喜悦的泪花，热烈拥抱中国同志。她说，这是她一生中最难忘的一天。
    “我们歌唱，我们欢呼，瑰丽的红太阳——毛泽东！我们的歌声飞上广阔的苍穹，战无不胜的毛泽东思想深入我们的心中！”这是一位越南小朋友在来信中写的一首热情的诗歌。越南小朋友，每次看到访问越南的中国同志，总是要求中国叔叔送给他们毛主席像章，要中国叔叔们教他们唱《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》。他们说，胡伯伯教导我们越中两国是同志加兄弟。我们热爱毛主席。
    波兰的一位少年也给中国朋友寄来一封信，信笺上贴着两个用鲜红的亮光纸剪成的五角星，并且在信纸上工工整整地用中文写下一个最光辉的名字：毛泽东。在另一封来信中，他用红笔画了一个光芒四射的五角星。他在信中说，我非常热爱毛泽东，毛主席是伟大的领袖、统帅。他还在信上写下毛主席的语录：“世界是属于你们的。”
