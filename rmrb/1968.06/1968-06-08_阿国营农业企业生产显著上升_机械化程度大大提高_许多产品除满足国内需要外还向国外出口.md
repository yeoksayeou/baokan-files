Albania's state-owned agricultural enterprises have seen a significant increase in production. The level of mechanization has greatly improved, and many products, in addition to meeting domestic needs, are also exported abroad.

	NEW YORK, June 8 (Xinhua) — Workers in Albania's state-owned agricultural enterprises are actively implementing the resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour. In the first quarter of this year, they supplied the market with 20 percent more vegetables than in the same period of 1967, which saw a significant increase in production. Additionally, there has been an increase in milk and meat products.

	Currently, more than 60 percent of the arable land owned by state-owned agricultural enterprises is irrigated, and the level of mechanization has reached 90 to 100 percent. Large plantations covering thousands of hectares have been established, with extensive planting of grapes, olives, citrus fruits, and other fruit trees.

	Due to various technical measures, the production of state-owned agricultural enterprises is significantly increasing. During the period from 1961 to 1965, the production of grain increased by 46 percent, cotton by 35 percent, and sugar beets by 41 percent, setting a good example for other agricultural sectors.

	In addition to supplying large quantities of agricultural and livestock products to the market, agricultural enterprises also provide high-quality seeds, purebred livestock, and various saplings to agricultural cooperatives. They also organize numerous training classes for cooperatives to cultivate agricultural technical talent.

	During the Fourth Five-Year Plan (1966-1970), Albania's state-owned agricultural enterprises will play an even greater role. They will account for 19 percent of the total grain production in the country, 25 percent of vegetables, 49 percent of potatoes, 34 percent of sugar beets, and 36 percent of grapes.

	Many products from state-owned agricultural enterprises, such as vegetables, fresh fruits, dried fruits, pork, and eggs, not only meet domestic needs but are also exported to foreign markets.

	According to a report by the Albanian News Agency, many agricultural cooperatives in Albania have planted large areas of high-quality cotton seeds, "Rushnia No. 1," this year. This fine-fiber cotton, widely used in the textile industry to produce high-quality products, was cultivated by researchers at the Rushnia Agricultural Research Institute after years of experimentation.

	Experiments conducted at the "Mao Zedong Textile Combine" in Përmet have also proven that domestically cultivated fine-fiber cotton meets the needs for producing high-quality textiles. (Accompanying photo)

    阿国营农业企业生产显著上升
    机械化程度大大提高  许多产品除满足国内需要外还向国外出口
    新华社地拉那电　阿尔巴尼亚国营农业企业的工人积极贯彻阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的决议，在今年第一季度里向市场提供的蔬菜比大增产的一九六七年同期增加百分之二十以上。此外，牛奶、肉类等也有增加。
    现在国营农业企业所拥有的耕地百分之六十以上是灌溉田，机械化程度达到百分之九十到百分之百。目前，已建立了面积达几千公顷的大种植园，大量种植葡萄、橄榄、柑桔和其它果树。
    由于采取各种技术措施，国营农业企业的产量正显著上升。在一九六一—一九六五年期间，面包谷物的产量增加百分之四十六，棉花增加百分之三十五，甜菜增加百分之四十一，为其它农业部门树立了良好的榜样。
    除了向市场供应大批农业产品和牲畜产品外，农业企业还向农业合作社提供精选的种籽，纯种牲畜，各种树苗。另外还为合作社开办了大量训练班，来培养农业技术人才。
    第四个五年计划期间（一九六六—一九七○年）阿尔巴尼亚国营农业企业将起更大的作用。在全国面包谷物总产量中，国营农业企业将占百分之十九，蔬菜占百分之二十五，马铃薯占百分之四十九，甜菜占百分之三十四，葡萄占百分之三十六。
    国营农业企业的许多产品，如蔬菜、鲜果、干果、猪肉和蛋类等，除满足国内需要外，还向国外市场出口。
    据新华社地拉那电　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道：阿尔巴尼亚许多农业合作社，今年大面积播种了优良棉种“鲁施尼亚一号”。这种在纺织工业中广泛用来生产优良产品的细纤维棉种，是鲁施尼亚农业科学研究所工作人员经过多年试验培育出来的。
    在培拉特的“毛泽东纺织联合工厂”进行的试验也证明，国内培育的细纤维棉种，适合生产优质纺织品的需要。（附图片）
