	In the farewell banquet hosted by President Nyerere, Premier Zhou Enlai delivered the following speech:

	Your Excellency President Julius K. Nyerere and Madam, distinguished guests from Tanzania, friends, comrades:

	This evening, with a heart full of parting sentiments, I attend the farewell banquet hosted by President Nyerere and Madam. Please allow me to express, on behalf of the Chinese comrades present at tonight's banquet, our gratitude for your invitation.

	President, your visit to China, though brief, has been very successful. During your visit, Chairman Mao Zedong and his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, had cordial conversations with you. We exchanged sincere and friendly views on the development of friendly cooperation between our two countries and on international issues of common concern. You and the Tanzanian guests also visited some of our factories, people's communes, and PLA units, and interacted with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. All of this will undoubtedly further enhance our mutual understanding and strengthen the friendly cooperation between our two countries, thereby contributing to the common cause of unity and anti-imperialism among the peoples of Asia and Africa.

	President, you have given a high evaluation of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and have highly praised the revolutionary spirit of our people. This is a great encouragement and support to the Chinese people. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, is aimed at ensuring that our socialist state will never change color. Currently, we are, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings, firmly relying on the broad masses of the people to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We are convinced that carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end is also in the fundamental interests of all revolutionary peoples in the world. We must unite with all anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist people around the world to carry the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys and running dogs through to the end.

	The smooth development of friendly cooperation between China and Tanzania is not accidental. Our relationship is based on the foundation of anti-imperialism, anti-colonialism, and the defense of national independence. We both oppose nuclear blackmail, nuclear monopoly, and so-called nuclear protection, and oppose nuclear colonialism. In your speech just now, President, you once again reiterated Tanzania's commendable and clear stance on the so-called "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons." We both firmly support the liberation struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. In our mutual relations, we both adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and oppose great-power chauvinism. In struggle, we support each other. In construction, we help each other. At all times, we treat each other as equals and respect each other, never interfering in each other's internal affairs or imposing on each other. Our friendship is not afraid of any enemy's provocation and has a broad future.

	Tomorrow morning, President and Madam, you will be leaving China. I request that you convey the deep friendship of the 700 million Chinese people to the Tanzanian brothers and to all the brothers in Africa.

	Please raise your glasses,

	To the prosperity and happiness of the people of the United Republic of Tanzania,
	To the friendship between the peoples of China and Tanzania,
	To the anti-imperialist unity of the peoples of Asia and Africa,
	To the health of President Nyerere and Madam,
	To the health of all Tanzanian guests,
	To the health of Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people,
	To the health of the ambassadors and their spouses present,
	To the health of all friends and comrades present,

	Cheers!

    在尼雷尔总统举行的告别宴会上
    周恩来总理的讲话
    新华社二十一日讯　周恩来总理在尼雷尔总统举行的告别宴会上的讲话，全文如下：尊敬的朱利叶斯·克·尼雷尔总统阁下和夫人，尊敬的坦桑尼亚贵宾们，朋友们，同志们：
    今天晚上，我怀着惜别的心情，参加尼雷尔总统阁下和夫人举行的告别宴会。请允许我代表出席今晚宴会的中国同志，对你们的邀请表示感谢。
    总统阁下这次访问中国，时间虽然短暂，却是很成功的。在访问期间，毛泽东主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席同阁下进行了亲切的交谈。我们双方就发展两国友好合作关系和共同关心的国际问题，诚挚友好地交换了意见。总统阁下和坦桑尼亚贵宾们，还参观了我们的一些工厂、人民公社和解放军部队，同广大工农兵群众进行了接触。所有这一切，无疑地会进一步增进我们相互之间的了解，加强两国之间的友好合作，从而对加强亚非人民团结反帝的共同事业作出贡献。
    总统阁下对中国的无产阶级文化大革命作了很高的评价，对我国人民的革命精神作了高度的赞扬。这是对于中国人民的巨大支持和鼓舞。我们伟大领袖毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的这场无产阶级文化大革命，是为了保证我国的社会主义江山永不变色。目前，我们正在根据毛主席的教导，坚决依靠广大人民群众，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。我们深信，把我国的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，也是符合全世界一切革命人民的根本利益的。我们一定要联合世界上一切反帝反殖的人们，把反对美帝国主义及其帮凶、走狗的斗争进行到底。
    中坦两国友好合作关系这样顺利发展，决不是偶然的。我们的关系是建立在反帝反殖和维护民族独立的基础之上的。我们都反对核讹诈、核垄断和所谓核保护，反对核殖民主义。总统阁下在刚才的讲话中又一次重申了坦桑尼亚对于所谓“防止核扩散条约”的值得称赞的明确态度。我们都坚决支持亚非拉人民的解放斗争。在我们的相互关系中，我们都遵循和平共处五项原则，反对大国沙文主义。在斗争中，我们互相支持。在建设中，我们互相帮助。在任何时候，我们都平等相待，互相尊重，从不干涉内政，从不强加于人。我们的这种友谊是不怕任何敌人挑拨的，是有广阔发展前途的。
    明天早上，总统阁下和夫人就要离开中国了。我请阁下把七亿中国人民的深厚友谊带给坦桑尼亚兄弟，带给全非洲的兄弟。
    请大家举杯，
    为坦桑尼亚联合共和国的繁荣昌盛和人民幸福，
    为中国和坦桑尼亚两国人民的友谊，
    为亚非人民的反帝团结，
    为尼雷尔总统阁下和夫人的健康，
    为全体坦桑尼亚贵宾们的健康，
    为中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的健康，
    为在座的各国使节和夫人的健康，
    为在座的朋友们和同志们的健康，
    干杯！
