Editor's Note: Yesterday, our newspaper published a commentary by a reporter from the Qinghai Daily, introducing the great achievements of the revolutionary criticism campaign in the Xining region. Today, we publish the experience of Shanghai Shipyard in carrying out revolutionary criticism, which illustrates the same principle: Revolutionary criticism is excellent!

In the process of revolutionary criticism, how do we hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and do thorough and detailed political and ideological work? How do we combine revolutionary criticism with the purge of class ranks? How do we combine it with the struggle, criticism, and reform in our own unit? The revolutionary cadres and masses of Shanghai Shipyard have made many good innovations, which are worth our attention.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Human beings must constantly summarize experience, make discoveries, inventions, and creations, and make progress." Chairman Mao also teaches us: "Through practice, truth is discovered, and through practice, truth is verified and developed." In this great revolutionary practice of the Cultural Revolution, we need to constantly discover and summarize experience. To continue the powerful development of revolutionary criticism, we must also constantly summarize experience. There are many Zhuge Liangs among the masses, and many precious innovations. As long as we respect the revolutionary practice of the people, are good at discovering, and good at summarizing, we will definitely be able to find good experiences and methods suitable for our region and unit to carry out revolutionary criticism.

From the Shanghai Shipyard Revolutionary Committee, with the enthusiastic support and assistance of the PLA Navy's support team, holding high the banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought, leading the broad revolutionary masses to carry out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, rapidly changing the spiritual face of the vast number of workers, greatly consolidating and developing the new revolutionary committee, and presenting a prosperous revolutionary scene. Since this year, the production plan has been overfulfilled every month, and the second 8,820 horsepower heavy-duty low-speed diesel engine in our country has been manufactured with high quality and high speed.

Mao Zedong Thought can never be separated from revolutionary criticism, which can never be relaxed

The proletarian revolutionaries of this factory achieved revolutionary unity in August last year and established the revolutionary committee in October. The revolutionary and production situation has been good ever since. After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, some comrades analyzed the situation and felt that their factory had "three goods and three abundances": good revolutionary unity, good revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and good production; many achievements, many praises, and many opportunities to share experiences outside. Therefore, some comrades developed a sense of complacency and fear of chaos, and temporarily relaxed revolutionary criticism. However, as the great leader Mao Zedong teaches: "Class struggle is an objective existence, not subject to the will of man." Once revolutionary criticism is relaxed, the class enemy will attack. A handful of class enemies took the opportunity to stir up trouble, on the one hand, hiding in dark corners to spread the counter-revolutionary economic wind of black revisionism, attempting to make the revolutionary committee busy dealing with affairs and sink into a pile of work. On the other hand, they played the counter-revolutionary two-faced trick, engaging in rightist splittist activities, attempting to overthrow the revolutionary committee.

With the help of the support team from the PLA, the factory revolutionary committee held several meetings, following Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle," using the perspective of class struggle and the method of class analysis to discuss the new situation, new trends, and new characteristics of class struggle in the entire factory, and severely criticizing the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" of the Chinese Khrushchev. Everyone deeply realized: The great victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is the victory of using Mao Zedong Thought to criticize the bourgeoisie and all exploitative class ideologies. To carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end, we must carry out revolutionary criticism to the end. The revolutionary committee must put the active learning and application of Mao Zedong Thought and leading the broad revolutionary masses to carry out in-depth revolutionary criticism in the first place. They have the following experiences in carrying out revolutionary criticism:

To fight the political battle of revolutionary criticism, we must first do good political and ideological work

Chairman Mao teaches: "To grasp ideological education is the central link in uniting the whole party to wage a great political struggle. If this task is not solved, the party's political tasks cannot be completed." Their first experience is that to fight the political battle of revolutionary criticism, we must first do good political and ideological work, arm the masses with Chairman Mao's great teachings on class and class struggle, organize the masses, and mobilize the masses.

The revolutionary criticism of this factory once experienced a stagnant period, mainly relying on a few people to write and speak, and many old workers felt they could not "join in." The revolutionary committee analyzed this situation and believed that the broad revolutionary masses were closest to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, most hated the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, knew most about the crimes of a small handful of unrepentant capitalist-roaders and other class enemies in their unit, and felt the harm of the poison of revisionism the deepest. They are the main force of revolutionary criticism. The problem lies in the leadership's further improvement of the understanding of the great significance of revolutionary criticism and the determination to launch a mass movement of revolutionary criticism. The revolutionary committee held Mao Zedong Thought study classes throughout the factory, studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions with various active thoughts in carrying out revolutionary criticism; and organized remembrance and sweetness activities throughout the factory to arouse the proletarian feelings of the broad revolutionary cadres and masses; and held dozens of special criticism symposiums and symposiums for women workers, elderly workers, young workers, and various professions.

Through this series of activities, the class struggle awareness and two-line struggle awareness of the broad revolutionary masses were further improved. They more clearly realized that doing well in revolutionary criticism is an actual action of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and resolutely defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and a top priority matter related to the country's eternal non-changing color.

Chairman Mao teaches: "Revolutionary war is the war of the masses; only by mobilizing the masses can we wage war, and only by relying on the masses can we wage war." Once the masses are mobilized, the face of revolutionary criticism throughout the factory will change rapidly. The broad revolutionary masses are not satisfied with just holding criticism meetings and publishing criticism columns, saying that this is "writing relies on 'scholars,' and speaking relies on 'eloquence'." The revolutionary workers of each class, under the leadership of the factory revolutionary committee, changed the previous practice. They, according to the unified deployment of the factory revolutionary committee, determined the time by themselves, found the materials by themselves, controlled the meeting by themselves, organized the criticism by themselves, and everyone spoke and wrote to criticize. Some old workers and women workers who usually did not speak much also faced the class enemies and actively participated in the revolutionary criticism. The entire factory combined large-scale criticism meetings with small-scale criticism meetings in classes; combined the key criticism of the backbone with the extensive criticism of the masses; combined the fixed-point, fixed-time, fixed-person, and fixed-center publication of criticism columns with the oral and written criticism of classes; combined written criticism with cartoon criticism, with criticism and struggle every day and everywhere, truly forming a vast ocean of revolutionary mass movement. The broad revolutionary masses were full of spirit and fighting spirit. A small handful of class enemies were frightened and suffered a crushing defeat.

Using the factory's struggle against the enemy as living materials to promote the in-depth development of revolutionary criticism

Combining revolutionary criticism with the purge of class ranks, using the crimes of a small handful of class enemies exposed in the struggle against the enemy as living materials, and carrying out a deeper criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev.

In the in-depth and sustained mass movement of revolutionary criticism, the broad revolutionary masses used Chairman Mao's teaching: "The Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, in essence, is a great political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism, and is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and its leadership and the broad revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." In contrast to the class struggle situation in the factory, they uncovered the lid of class struggle and used great criticism as a sharp weapon to carry out the struggle against the enemy. The broad revolutionary workers had a book of the factory's history and a book of enemy situation. They, through in-depth and detailed investigations, clarified the origin and development of a small handful of class enemies and accurately and firmly dug out a small handful of deeply hidden class enemies.

The crimes of the small handful of class enemies who were dug out became the living materials for the entire factory to carry out revolutionary criticism. Under the help of the PLA support team, the broad workers held an exhibition of the crimes of class enemies, linking the crimes of class enemies with the Chinese Khrushchev and other top capitalist-roaders in the party, organizing the masses to visit, explain, accuse, and criticize. They, with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a sharp weapon, criticized the black words of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the unit to the point of no escape. The broad revolutionary masses saw that it was the revisionist cadre line and party-building line of the Chinese Khrushchev to recruit and protect traitors and form cliques that sheltered this small handful of class enemies; the Chinese Khrushchev and this small handful of class enemies sang the same black tune and walked the same black path, and they were the total representatives of all their evil activities, thus concentrating all hatred on the Chinese Khrushchev and a small handful of class enemies. The broad masses reflected that such criticism, using the crimes of a small handful of class enemies as living materials, could be seen, touched, and hated, with strong firepower, not only overthrowing this small handful of counter-revolutionary gang of black hands but also criticizing and stinking their total representative, the Chinese Khrushchev, eliminating the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and thus consolidating the victory of the struggle against the enemy in politics, ideology, theory, and organization.

Combining revolutionary criticism with the struggle, criticism, and reform of the unit, firmly establishing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line

Combining revolutionary criticism with the struggle, criticism, and reform of the unit, severely criticizing the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, and firmly establishing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, letting the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly high throughout the factory.

"Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism, is revolution.... Destruction comes first, and construction is within it." The new and old cadres of the factory revolutionary committee and the PLA support personnel repeatedly studied this great teaching of Chairman Mao, deeply realizing: The surging revolutionary criticism mass movement is increasingly deeply criticizing the whole set of counter-revolutionary revisionist industrial lines of the Chinese Khrushchev, impacting the old superstructure serving this set of lines, and washing away the mud and dirt of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. The broad masses threw themselves into the torrent of revolutionary criticism, learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle, strongly promoting the unprecedented popularization of Mao Zedong Thought. This powerfully ensured that the factory enterprises advanced in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao. Under the support of the PLA, the factory revolutionary committee led the masses to consciously, in the process of destroying the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of managing enterprises, establish Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The overlapping administrative organs began to be broken. A large number of new things shining with the light of Mao Zedong Thought are emerging in the revolutionary criticism, greatly promoting the development of various works.

The second 8,820 horsepower heavy-duty low-speed diesel engine in our country, designed and manufactured with domestic raw materials, is a great achievement of revolutionary criticism, a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. When accepting this task, the broad revolutionary workers repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teaching: "We cannot follow the old path of technological development of all countries in the world, crawling behind others step by step." What foreigners have, we must have, and what foreigners do not have, we must also have. They severely criticized the reactionary fallacies of crawling and slavery spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the industrial system and engaged in face-to-face debates and struggles with a small handful of capitalist-roaders and bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities." When encountering difficulties in manufacturing, the "three-in-one combination" group composed of revolutionary workers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary technical personnel severely criticized the black goods spread by the Chinese Khrushchev, such as "expert management" and "technology first," broke superstitions, liberated thoughts, pooled wisdom, and turned the production site into a battlefield of revolutionary criticism and a classroom for learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought. When this diesel engine was tested and accepted, they organized revolutionary criticism on the spot, using living facts to strongly accuse the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev in promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist industrial line and enthusiastically praising the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, making Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line further deeply rooted in people's hearts.

Some classes, before the Cultural Revolution, due to the efforts of a small handful of capitalist-roaders in the factory to promote the black goods of counter-revolutionary revisionism such as "business first" and "material incentives," did not emphasize proletarian politics, creating disunity among class members, male and female workers, and workers with high and low skills. In the revolutionary criticism, everyone found the root of these black goods, eliminated its poison, and quickly united closely on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, establishing a new type of relationship of "mutual care, mutual love, and mutual help."

The revolutionary committee should become a vigorous command center leading the masses in class struggle

The members of the revolutionary committee stand on the front line of class struggle, grasping ideology, organization, key issues, and direction, making revolutionary criticism continuously develop in breadth and depth, and making the revolutionary committee a vigorous command center leading the masses in class struggle.

Chairman Mao teaches: "Throughout the transitional period, there are class contradictions, there is class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and there is a struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism. Forgetting the basic theory and basic practice of our party's class struggle in the past decade or so will lead us to the wrong path."

The revolutionary cadres, military representatives, and revolutionary masses of the factory revolutionary committee, on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, unified their will and closely united, playing a powerful role as a revolutionary fighting command center. They went deep among the masses, stood on the front line of class struggle, and participated in study classes, symposiums, and heart-to-heart talks with the broad revolutionary masses, vigorously promoting Mao Zedong Thought, and doing thorough and detailed political and ideological work. They both mobilized the masses and did not bind the hands and feet of the masses with rules and regulations, and strengthened organizational leadership, deploying major battles of revolutionary criticism throughout the factory, pushing revolutionary criticism wave upon wave forward. The new and old cadres and military representatives of the revolutionary committee respectively formed several "three-in-one combination" teams, going deep into key primary units, and carrying out revolutionary criticism with the revolutionary workers there, gaining experience in leading revolutionary criticism from the "point," and promoting the general. They especially paid attention to grasping the party's policies and correctly handling the two types of different nature contradictions, always directing the spearhead of struggle at a small handful of class enemies.

The military representatives made significant contributions in the class struggle. They brought the good traditions, good styles, and good experiences of the PLA emphasizing proletarian politics into the revolutionary committee, and firmly fought against a small handful of class enemies who plotted to sabotage revolutionary criticism and split the revolutionary committee; at the same time, for those who were temporarily deceived and made mistakes, they, with fiery class feelings, did thorough and detailed political and ideological work, helping them to recognize their mistakes and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

    把革命大批判和本单位的斗批改结合起来  在阶级斗争风浪中巩固和发展革命委员会
    上海沪东造船厂取得对敌斗争好经验
    编者按：昨天本报刊登了《青海日报》的记者述评，介绍了西宁地区开展革命大批判的巨大成果。今天发表的上海沪东造船厂开展革命大批判的经验，说明了一个同样的道理：革命的大批判好得很！
    在革命的大批判中，怎样高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，做好深入细致的政治思想工作？怎样把革命的大批判和清理阶级队伍结合起来？怎样和本单位的斗批改结合起来？上海沪东造船厂的广大革命职工和革命干部有不少很好的创造，值得我们重视。
    毛主席教导我们：“人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。”毛主席又教导我们：“通过实践而发现真理，又通过实践而证实真理和发展真理。”在无产阶级文化大革命这个伟大的革命实践中，需要我们不断地发现和总结经验。为了把革命的大批判继续有力地开展下去，也要不断地总结经验。群众中有很多的诸葛亮，有很多可贵的创造。只要我们尊重人民群众的革命实践，善于发现，善于总结，就一定能够找到适合本地区、本单位情况的开展革命大批判的好经验、好方法。
    本报讯　上海沪东造船厂革命委员会，在人民解放军海军支左部队的热情支持和帮助下，高举毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，率领广大革命群众开展了深入、持久的革命大批判，迅速地改变着广大职工的精神面貌，大大巩固和发展了新生的革命委员会，出现了一派欣欣向荣的革命景象。今年以来，月月超额完成国家生产计划，并且高质量、高速度制造出我国第二台八千八百二十马力重型低速柴油机。
    毛泽东思想永远离不得革命大批判永远松不得
    这个工厂的无产阶级革命派，去年八月实现了革命大联合，十月建立了革命委员会，革命和生产形势一直较好。革委会成立后，部分同志在分析形势时，认为自己工厂有“三好三多”：革命大联合好，革命“三结合”好，生产好；成绩多，受表扬多，外出介绍经验多。因此，个别同志产生了骄傲自满和求稳怕乱的情绪，一度放松了革命大批判。但是，正如伟大领袖毛主席所教导的：“阶级斗争是客观存在，不依人的意志为转移的。”革命大批判松一松，阶级敌人就攻一攻。一小撮阶级敌人乘机兴风作浪，一方面躲在阴暗角落里大刮反革命经济主义黑风，妄图使革命委员会忙于应付，陷入事务堆里。另一方面又玩弄反革命两面派手法，大搞右倾分裂活动，妄图颠覆革命委员会。
    在解放军支左人员帮助下，厂革委会接连召开了几次会议，遵照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，用阶级斗争的观点和阶级分析的方法，大议全厂阶级斗争的新形势、新动向、新特点，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论。大家深刻认识到：无产阶级文化大革命运动的伟大胜利，就是用毛泽东思想批判资产阶级和一切剥削阶级思想的胜利。要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，就要把革命大批判进行到底。革命委员会一定要把活学活用毛泽东思想，带领广大革命群众深入开展革命大批判放在首要地位。他们开展革命大批判有以下几点经验：
    打好革命大批判这个政治仗首先要做好政治思想工作
    毛主席教导说：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。如果这个任务不解决，党的一切政治任务是不能完成的。”他们的第一条经验是，要打好革命大批判这场政治仗，首先要做好政治思想工作，用毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的伟大教导，武装群众，组织群众，发动群众。
    这个工厂的革命大批判，有一个时期曾经出现过停滞现象，主要靠少数人动笔、动嘴，许多老工人感到“插不上手”。革命委员会分析了这种情况，认为广大革命群众对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线最亲，对中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线最恨，对本单位一小撮死不悔改的走资派和其他阶级敌人的罪行了解最多，对修正主义流毒的危害体会最深。他们是革命大批判的主力军。问题在于领导上要进一步提高对革命大批判伟大意义的认识，下决心发动一场革命大批判的群众运动。革委会就在全厂大办毛泽东思想学习班，带着开展革命大批判中的各种活思想，大学毛主席最新指示；并且在全厂组织忆苦思甜活动，激发广大革命干部和群众的无产阶级感情；并开了几十次各种专题的大批判座谈会和女工、老年工人、青年工人及各工种的座谈会。
    通过这一系列活动，进一步提高了广大革命群众的阶级斗争觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟。他们更加清楚地认识到：搞好革命大批判是无限忠于毛主席，坚决捍卫毛主席无产阶级革命路线的实际行动，是关系到国家永不变色的头等大事。
    毛主席教导说：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”群众一经发动起来，全厂革命大批判的面貌就迅速改观。广大革命群众不满足于光开批判大会，光出大批判专栏，说这是“写稿靠‘秀才’，发言靠‘口才’”。各个班组的革命职工，在厂革委会领导下改变了过去的做法，他们根据厂革委会的统一部署，自己确定时间，自己寻找材料，自己掌握会议，自己组织批判，人人口诛笔伐。一些平时讲话不多的老工人和女工，也与阶级敌人展开了面对面的斗争，积极地投入了革命大批判。整个工厂把大会批判和班组的小会批判结合起来；把骨干的重点批判和群众的广泛批判结合起来；把定点、定时、定人、定中心出版大批判专栏，与班组的口诛笔伐结合起来；把文字批判和漫画批判结合起来，天天有斗批，处处是战场，真正形成了革命群众运动的汪洋大海。广大革命群众意气风发，斗志昂扬。一小撮阶级敌人心惊胆颤，遭到了灭顶之灾。
    利用本厂对敌斗争中的活材料促进革命大批判的深入发展
    把革命大批判与清理阶级队伍结合起来，利用对敌斗争中揭露出来的一小撮阶级敌人的反革命罪行作为活材料，开展对中国赫鲁晓夫的更深入的批判。
    在深入、持久的革命大批判群众运动中，广大革命群众用毛主席的教导“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”对照工厂阶级斗争状况，大揭阶级斗争的盖子，把大批判当作深入开展对敌斗争的锐利武器。广大革命工人群众肚子里装了一本厂史账，一本敌情账。他们通过深入细致的调查研究，弄清一小撮阶级敌人的来龙去脉，稳准狠地挖出了一小撮隐藏很深的阶级敌人。
    被挖出来的一小撮阶级敌人的反革命罪行，成了全厂进行革命大批判的活材料。广大职工在解放军支左部队帮助下，举办了阶级敌人罪行展览会，把阶级敌人的桩桩罪行、句句黑话都与中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派挂上钩，组织群众参观，边讲解，边控诉，边批判。他们以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为锐利武器，把中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本单位的代理人的黑话批得体无完肤。广大革命群众看清了正是中国赫鲁晓夫推行的招降纳叛、结党营私的修正主义干部路线、建党路线，庇护了这一小撮阶级敌人；中国赫鲁晓夫与这一小撮阶级敌人唱着一个黑调子，走着一条黑路子，是他们一切罪恶活动的总代表，从而把千仇万恨集中在中国赫鲁晓夫等一小撮阶级敌人身上。广大群众反映，这样批，把一小撮阶级敌人的罪行作为活材料，看得见，摸得着，恨得起，火力猛，既打倒了这一小撮反革命黑帮，又批臭了他们的总代表中国赫鲁晓夫，肃清了反革命修正主义路线的流毒，从而在政治上、思想上、理论上、组织上巩固了对敌斗争的胜利。
    把革命大批判与本单位斗批改紧密结合起来，大立毛主席的无产阶级革命路线
    把革命大批判与本单位斗批改紧密结合起来，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗在全厂高高飘扬。
    “不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。……破字当头，立也就在其中了。”工厂革委会的新老干部和解放军支左人员一起反复学习了毛主席的这一伟大教导，深刻地认识到：波澜壮阔的革命大批判群众运动，越来越深刻地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫推行的一整套反革命修正主义工业路线，冲击着为这一套路线服务的旧上层建筑，涤荡着资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的污泥浊水。广大群众投身于革命大批判的洪流，在斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想，强有力地促进了毛泽东思想的空前大普及。这就有力地保证了工厂企业沿着毛主席指引的方向阔步前进。工厂革委会在解放军支持下，因势利导，带领群众自觉地在大破反革命修正主义办企业路线的同时，大立毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。重叠的行政机构开始打破了。大量闪烁着毛泽东思想光辉的新生事物，正在革命大批判中不断涌现，大大推动了各项工作的开展。
    我国自行设计，用国产原材料自行制造的第二台八千八百二十马力重型低速柴油机，高质量、高速度地制成，就是革命大批判的伟大成果，就是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。在接受这项任务时，广大革命职工反复学习了毛主席的教导：“我们不能走世界各国技术发展的老路，跟在别人后面一步一步地爬行。”外国有的，我们要有，外国没有的，我们也要有。他们狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在工业系统散布的爬行主义、奴隶主义等反动谬论，并且与一小撮走资派和资产阶级反动学术“权威”展开了面对面的辩论和斗争。在制造中遇到困难的时候，由革命工人、革命干部和革命技术人员组成的“三结合”小组，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫散布的“专家治厂”、“技术第一”等等黑货，破除迷信，解放思想，群策群力，把生产现场变成革命大批判的战场，变成活学活用毛泽东思想的课堂。当这台柴油机试车验收时，又在现场组织了革命的大批判，用活生生的事实，有力控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫推行反革命修正主义工业路线的滔天罪行，热情歌颂了伟大领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想，使毛主席的无产阶级革命路线进一步深入人心。
    有些班组在文化大革命以前，由于厂内一小撮走资派竭力推行“业务第一”、“物质刺激”等反革命修正主义的黑货，不突出无产阶级政治，制造了组内组长和组员、男工和女工、技术高和技术低的同志之间的不团结。在革命大批判中，大家找到了这些黑货的总根子，肃清了它的流毒，很快在毛泽东思想基础上紧密团结起来，建立了“互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助”的新型关系。
    革命委员会要成为朝气蓬勃的领导广大群众进行阶级斗争的指挥部
    革命委员会领导成员站在阶级斗争第一线，抓思想，抓组织，抓重点，抓方向，使革命大批判不断向广度和深度发展，使革委会成为朝气蓬勃的领导广大群众进行阶级斗争的指挥部。
    毛主席教导说：“整个过渡时期存在着阶级矛盾、存在着无产阶级和资产阶级的阶级斗争、存在着社会主义和资本主义的两条道路斗争。忘记十几年来我党的这一条基本理论和基本实践，就会要走到斜路上去。”
    工厂革命委员会中的革命干部代表、军队代表和革命群众代表三方面力量，在毛泽东思想的基础上统一意志，紧密团结，有力地发挥了革命战斗指挥部的作用。他们深入群众，站在阶级斗争第一线，和广大革命群众一起参加学习班，开座谈会，开展谈心活动，大力宣传毛泽东思想，做深入细致的政治思想工作。他们既放手发动群众，不用条条框框束缚群众的手脚，又加强组织领导，部署全厂革命大批判的重大战役，把革命大批判一浪高过一浪地推向前进。革委会中的新老干部和军队代表分别组成几个“三结合”的班子，深入重点基层单位，和那里的革命职工一起开展革命大批判，在“点”上取得领导革命大批判的经验，推动一般。他们特别注意掌握党的方针政策，正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾，始终把斗争矛头对准一小撮阶级敌人。
    军队代表在阶级斗争中，作出了重大贡献。他们把解放军突出无产阶级政治的一整套好传统、好作风、好经验带进了革委会，对阴谋破坏革命大批判、分裂革命委员会的一小撮阶级敌人坚决进行了针锋相对的斗争；同时对那些一时受蒙蔽犯了错误的革命群众，则以火热的阶级感情，进行深入细致的政治思想工作，帮助他们认识错误，回到毛主席的革命路线上来。
