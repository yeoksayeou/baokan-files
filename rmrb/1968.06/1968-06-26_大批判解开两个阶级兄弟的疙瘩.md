Livestock keeper Liu Gongshen and brigade leader Liu Hanjie were both hired hands for a landlord in the old society, and they were class brothers who shared life and death. However, later on, they had a falling out.

The story is as follows: In 1962, the Chinese Khrushchev's agent in Shandong promoted the "material incentive" black goods of the Chinese Khrushchev, stirring up a "bonus as the commander" evil wind. This evil wind also blew into Liujiazhuang Brigade of Yanghe People's Commune in Yidu County, Shandong. Livestock keeper Liu Gongshen's cow gave birth to a calf, and the original brigade leader rewarded him with five yuan. When the cow gave birth to a second calf, the new brigade leader Liu Hanjie insisted on prioritizing proletarian politics and did not reward him. Liu Gongshen couldn't understand this and held a grudge against Liu Hanjie.

Not long ago, a propaganda team from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army helped the brigade set up a Mao Zedong Thought study class. In the study class, poor and lower-middle peasants recalled the bitterness of the old society. When they mentioned the bitter days, Liu Hanjie and Liu Gongshen both remembered an old song: "To eat the landlord's food, one must risk one's life; raising children without seeing them, tears flow wide as the Yanghe River." Hanjie said: "Before liberation, I and Gongshen worked for the landlord, slept in the same pen with pigs, and ate from the same bowl as dogs. That winter, the snow was more than a foot deep. I fell ill in the pigpen, and Gongshen sold his only ragged cotton-padded jacket to buy some medicine, curing my illness. Without the jacket, at night, we huddled together, heart to heart..." Hanjie spoke more and more sadly, and Gongshen's tears flowed like a spring.

The next day, the study class held a revolutionary criticism session. Everyone angrily said that the Chinese Khrushchev's "work points as the commander" and "material incentive" were attempts to corrupt our souls with the bourgeois "self" and lure us to follow him down the capitalist road, so that he could restore capitalism in China. The Chinese Khrushchev is more poisonous than a snake! Hanjie said: "What 'work points as the commander,' 'material incentive,' these black goods are poison wrapped in sugar. If we let the Chinese Khrushchev's plot to restore capitalism succeed, we will return to the dark days of the Kuomintang's reactionary rule and become slaves to the landlords again. We must not be fooled by the Chinese Khrushchev!"

Everyone's speech deeply moved Liu Gongshen. He looked up at Chairman Mao's portrait, and a thousand words surged to his heart: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! It is you who saved me, but the Chinese Khrushchev wants to harm me. I was fooled by him, treating my class brother as an enemy. How can I face you, Chairman Mao! Thinking this, he suddenly stood up, walked to the front of the stage, and respectfully bowed to Chairman Mao. Turning around, he tightly grasped Hanjie's hand and said excitedly: "Hanjie, this knot between us was tied by the Chinese Khrushchev; today, Chairman Mao has untied it. Let us forever follow Chairman Mao and walk the bright path of socialism!"

### 大批判解开两个阶级兄弟的疙瘩

    大批判解开两个阶级兄弟的疙瘩
    饲养员刘功臣和生产队长刘汉杰，在旧社会一块儿给地主当长工，是一对同生死、共患难的阶级兄弟。可是，后来两人却结了疙瘩。
    事情是这样的：一九六二年，中国赫鲁晓夫在山东的代理人，大肆贩卖中国赫鲁晓夫“物质刺激”的黑货，刮起了一股“奖金挂帅”的妖风。这股妖风也刮到了山东益都县阳河公社刘家庄大队。饲养员刘功臣喂的牛繁殖了一头牛犊，原生产队长就奖了他五元钱。当繁殖第二头牛犊的时候，新任队长刘汉杰坚持突出无产阶级政治，没有奖励他。刘功臣心里想不通，就对刘汉杰有了意见。
    不久前，解放军某部毛泽东思想宣传队，帮助这个大队办起了毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里，贫下中农们回忆了旧社会的苦。提起那黄连般的日子，刘汉杰和刘功臣都想起了当年的一首歌谣：“要吃庄子（指郭家庄子地主）饭，得拿命去换，养儿不见儿，泪水阳河宽。”汉杰说：“解放前，我和功臣给地主扛活，和猪睡一个栏，和狗吃一个盆。那年腊月，大雪一尺多厚，我病在猪栏里，功臣卖了仅有的一件破棉衣，换来一点药，治好了我的病。没了棉衣，夜里，俺俩就心贴心地挤在一块……”汉杰越说越心酸，功臣泪水似泉涌。
    第二天，学习班搞革命大批判，大家愤怒地说，中国赫鲁晓夫搞什么“工分挂帅”、“物质刺激”，就是想用资产阶级的“私”字腐蚀我们的灵魂，引诱我们跟他走资本主义的邪道，好让他在中国复辟资本主义。中国赫鲁晓夫真是比毒蛇还毒！汉杰说：“什么
  ‘工分挂帅’、‘物质刺激’，这些黑货是包着糖皮的砒霜。如果让中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的阴谋得逞，我们就要回到国民党反动统治的黑暗时代，重新给地主当牛作马。我们绝不能上中国赫鲁晓夫的当！”
    大家的发言，句句打动着刘功臣的心。他抬头望着毛主席像，千言万语涌上心头：毛主席啊，毛主席！是您救了我，可是中国赫鲁晓夫却要害死我。我上了他的当，把阶级兄弟当冤家，这怎么对得起您老人家啊！想着想着，他忽地站了起来，走到台前，恭恭敬敬地向毛主席鞠了个躬，转过身来紧紧地握住汉杰的手，激动地说：“汉杰，咱俩的疙瘩是中国赫鲁晓夫给结下的；今天是毛主席给咱解开的，让咱们永远跟着毛主席走社会主义的光明大道！”
