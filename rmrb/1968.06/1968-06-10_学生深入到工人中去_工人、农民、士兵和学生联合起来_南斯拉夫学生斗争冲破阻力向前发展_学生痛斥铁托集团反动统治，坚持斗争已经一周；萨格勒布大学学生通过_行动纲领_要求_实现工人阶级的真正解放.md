Students in Yugoslavia deepen their struggle, breaking through obstacles

Students denounce the reactionary rule of the Tito clique, continuing the struggle for a week; students of the University of Zagreb pass the "Program of Action" demanding "the true liberation of the working class"

	New China News Agency, June 9th: A message from Belgrade reports that the struggle of Yugoslavian students against the reactionary policies of the Tito renegade clique, which erupted on June 2nd, has persisted for a week and is currently breaking through numerous obstacles, continuing to advance.

	On the 7th, students of the University of Belgrade posted new slogans around the buildings of many departments: "Workers and students unite!" "Workers, peasants, soldiers, primary and secondary school students, and university students unite!" and so on. Students have continued to hold meetings over the past few days, demanding that the Yugoslav revisionist authorities immediately release students who have been unlawfully arrested and illegally interrogated in recent days; demanding the punishment of the butchers who brutally suppressed the students and the withdrawal of the police surrounding the schools. Many students and some teachers, in their speeches, angrily denounced the crimes of the Tito renegade clique in restoring capitalism and expressed strong dissatisfaction with the privileged class enjoying privileges and the children of workers and peasants being discriminated against and unable to attend school. They pointed out that many workers today only receive the lowest income, living in poverty, while others are becoming rich. Some revolutionary students called on students to go deep into the workers.

	On the 6th, some students of the University of Zagreb also suggested going to the workers, letting the workers understand the students' demands. This proposal was widely supported by the students. When the initiator of this proposal spoke at a discussion meeting in the political science department of this university, his speech was interrupted several times by cheers of "Workers-Students." Recently, the students of this university also passed their own "Program of Action," demanding "the true liberation of the working class" and demanding "freedom of publication, freedom of the press, and freedom of assembly."

	The Yugoslav revisionist authorities are very panicked about the students' persistent struggle. The authorities of the University of Belgrade recently issued a notice exclaiming that the current situation is "very serious." The Yugoslav revisionist ruling clique, on the one hand, is using the propaganda machine to slander and threaten the students, and on the other hand, is preparing for large-scale suppression.

    南斯拉夫学生斗争冲破阻力向前发展
  学生痛斥铁托集团反动统治，坚持斗争已经一周；萨格勒布大学学生通过“行动纲领”要求“实现工人阶级的真正解放”
    新华社九日讯　贝尔格莱德消息：六月二日爆发的南斯拉夫学生反对铁托叛徒集团反动政策的斗争，已经坚持了一周，目前正在冲破重重阻力，继续向前发展。
    七日，贝尔格莱德大学学生又在许多系的建筑物周围张贴了新的标语：“工人和学生联合起来！”“工人、农民、士兵、中小学生和大学生联合起来！”等等。学生们连日来继续举行集会，要求南修当局立即释放几天来被无理逮捕和非法审讯的学生；要求惩办野蛮镇压学生的刽子手和撤退包围学校的警察等。许多学生和一些教师在发言中愤怒谴责铁托叛徒集团复辟资本主义的罪行，并对特权阶层享受特权、工农子女倍受歧视不能上学等等现象表示强烈不满。他们指出，许多工人今天只获得最低的收入，生活贫困，而另外一些人却在发财致富。一些革命学生呼吁学生们深入到工人中去。
    六日，萨格勒布大学的一些学生也建议到工人中去，让工人了解学生们的要求。这一主张深受广大学生的支持。当倡议者在这所大学政治科学系的讨论会上提出这一建议时，他的讲话几次被“工人—学生”的欢呼声所打断。最近，这个大学的学生还通过了自己的“行动纲领”，要求“实现工人阶级的真正解放”和要求“出版自由、新闻自由和集会自由”等。
    南修当局对学生们坚持斗争的行动十分恐慌。贝尔格莱德大学当局在最近发布的一个公告中惊呼，目前的局势“十分严重”。南修统治集团一方面开动宣传机器，对学生大肆污蔑和恫吓，另一方面正在准备进行大规模镇压。
