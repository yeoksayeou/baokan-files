Resolutely Protect and Support the Revolutionary Spirit of the Masses

Zong Jingtai, Head of Longsheng Brigade, Xinhua Commune, Ningcheng County, Chifeng Prefecture, Inner Mongolia

Our great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship." Based on Chairman Mao's instructions, I reviewed my experiences over the past two years participating in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and deeply felt that believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and protecting and supporting the revolutionary spirit of the masses is the core of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Whether one can correctly handle relations with the masses is a major issue of standing and line.

In the early days of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I followed Chairman Mao's instructions to mobilize the masses to speak out, write big-character posters, and together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, sweep away the Four Olds and open fire on the class enemies, achieving initial victories.

Later, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the countryside reached a new high tide. This time, as soon as it began, three big-character posters were pasted on me. My wife came back and told me, "This time they've pasted big-character posters on you. See how you handle it!" I said, "What's the big deal about pasting a few big-character posters on me? This is a good phenomenon, proving that the masses have been mobilized. If we don't let the masses paste big-character posters, how can the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution be carried out?" She asked, "Is what they wrote all facts?" I said, "As long as there are opinions, people should be allowed to express them. The masses just raised a few opinions, and if we immediately ask whether they are facts, will the masses dare to paste big-character posters on me?"

During the period of speaking out, the masses collectively studied Chairman Mao's works, and I also studied at home with my wife and daughter. We first studied a quote from Chairman Mao: "Since we are serving the people, we should not be afraid of criticism and corrections. No matter who points out our shortcomings, we should welcome it." I said, "I have been a cadre for over ten years. When others have shortcomings and mistakes, I point them out. Can I not allow others to criticize me when I have shortcomings and mistakes? Now the commune members have pasted a few big-character posters on me, and we should welcome them. Even if some of the big-character posters do not fully conform to the facts, we should not rush to explain to the masses. Didn't Chairman Mao say, 'We should believe in the masses, we should believe in the Party, these are two fundamental principles. If we doubt these two principles, then we can accomplish nothing'?" After explaining this, my wife agreed. I said, "In the future, they might send big-character posters to our home. We should be mentally prepared. If revolutionary masses send big-character posters, we should welcome them with applause from the whole family. I'll read them, you follow, and let the girl get the paste to stick them up." The next day, the commune members indeed came to my home with drums and gongs to deliver big-character posters. At that time, I was tying ropes at the livestock shed. Hearing the drums and gongs, I quickly ran back home. We three followed the plan from the previous night and received the big-character posters, sticking them on the wall.

Although I understood that I should welcome the masses' criticism, seeing the big-character posters covering the walls inside and outside the courtyard, I felt uneasy. I thought, "Why do the masses have so many opinions about me, Zong Jingtai?" Although I had some idea, I must admit that I felt quite pressured. At this time, a notice was posted outside saying that a meeting would be held tonight to criticize me. This made my emotions even more turbulent. I thought, "I, Zong Jingtai, am from a poor peasant family. Under the Party's leadership, I have worked diligently for the masses for over ten years. Can't I say I have some merits? At least I have some hard work to show." The more I thought, the more I couldn't understand. Just at this moment, I looked up and saw the benevolent portrait of our great savior, Chairman Mao, and it was as if two doors had opened in my heart, instantly filling me with strength. I studied the "Sixteen Points" personally drafted by Chairman Mao, repeatedly reciting, "Many leading comrades in many units do not understand, are not serious about, and are not effective in leading this great struggle, and thus are in a position of weakness and helplessness. They are headed by the word 'fear,' cling to old rules, are not willing to break conventions, and do not strive for progress. They feel sudden about the new revolutionary order of the masses, and thus lag behind the situation and lag behind the masses." The more I read, the clearer my mind became. I thought, "I must not lag behind the situation and lag behind the masses. I must stand up to this test." I went to the livestock shed and, as usual, arranged the day's production. Livestock keeper Zhang Baogui pointed at the red paper on the wall and asked, "What's written on that?" I said, "That's a notice for tonight's meeting to criticize me." Zhang Baogui said, "Then why are you still arranging things?" Although Zhang Baogui's words hurt my heart, I thought of Chairman Mao's instructions and said confidently, "The meeting is tonight, but we still need to arrange production as usual during the day." After saying this, I arranged the production and left.

In the evening, I attended the mass meeting. The masses asked me, "Can you accept so many big-character posters from everyone?" I said, "Didn't Chairman Mao say, 'Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the people's interests, making every one of us who is alive feel sad when we think of them. Can we not sacrifice our personal interests and abandon our mistakes for the people's interests?' Everyone pasting big-character posters on me is to help me correct my mistakes. I welcome it with both hands and have nothing to accept." At the meeting, the revolutionary masses seriously criticized my shortcomings and mistakes. Later, a poor peasant commune member spoke, "Since Zong Jingtai became the brigade leader, he has done so much basic agricultural construction. Our brigade's grain production has increased by more than one fold. Especially since last year, he has led us to study Chairman Mao's works extensively, raising the class consciousness of the masses and boosting their enthusiasm. I think he is our good cadre." At the meeting, the masses, based on my performance and attitude, allowed me to continue as the brigade leader and asked if I had any objections. I said, "I have no objections. As long as it is revolutionary work, I will do it. How else can I say I am following Chairman Mao's words?" I immediately arranged the production tasks.

Last October, Chairman Mao's latest instructions were issued. Chairman Mao's words touched our hearts, and the more I listened, the more I loved them. Chairman Mao called on us to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," and I followed Chairman Mao's words to resolutely fight against selfishness. I have been a cadre for over ten years, and I have many mistakes and shortcomings. At the commune members' meeting, I laid out all the mistakes and shortcomings from my over ten years of work and made a thorough self-criticism to the broad poor and lower-middle peasants. The commune members discussed, "Zong Jingtai seriously listens to Chairman Mao's words, and that's good enough." I originally thought that if my mistakes were mentioned, the commune members would definitely be very angry, but unexpectedly, I received the masses' understanding. This time, when the production brigade elected a new leadership team, I was still elected as the brigade leader. At that moment, my emotions were very stirred, and I couldn't help but shed tears of joy. I thought, "I have made so many mistakes, but the commune members still understand and believe in me. This is how much they trust me!" I decided to correct my shortcomings and mistakes. In the past, I did not believe in the masses, was quick to criticize others, and was not good at political work. This time, I have changed. I discuss everything with the commune members patiently and strive to be a student of the masses.

Through the two years of the Cultural Revolution, I have received a profound education on how to handle relations with the masses and have further understood Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The revolutionary spirit of the broad masses not only helps cadres sweep away the ideological dirt and overcome shortcomings and mistakes in work, but more importantly, it fundamentally ensures that the leading cadre team will never change color. In the future, I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's instructions, resolutely protect and support the revolutionary spirit of the masses, humbly accept the masses' criticism and supervision, and together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, make our brigade's revolution and production even better.

    坚决保护和支持群众的革命精神
    内蒙古昭乌达盟宁城县新华公社长胜四队队长　宗景太
    伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”根据毛主席的教导，我回顾了两年来参加无产阶级文化大革命的经历，深深体会到：相信群众，依靠群众，保护和支持群众的革命精神，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的核心。能不能正确地对待群众，这是站在什么立场，执行什么路线的大问题。
    无产阶级文化大革命初期，我遵照毛主席的教导，发动群众大鸣大放，写大字报，和贫下中农一起横扫了四旧，向阶级敌人开火，取得了初步的胜利。
    后来，农村无产阶级文化大革命掀起了高潮。这一回，一开始先给我贴了三张大字报。我老婆看大字报回来对我说：“这回把大字报贴到你头上了，看你怎么办？”我说：“给我贴几张大字报怕什么？这是好现象，证明群众发动起来了。不让群众贴大字报，无产阶级文化大革命怎么开展呢？”她说：“他们写的都是事实吗？”我说：“只要有意见，就得让人家说出来。群众刚提一点意见，就追问是不是事实，那群众还敢给我贴大字报吗？”
    大鸣大放期间，群众集体学习毛主席著作，我也在家里和老婆、女儿一起学习。我们首先学习了毛主席的一条语录：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。”我说：“我当干部十多年了。别人有缺点和错误，我就提出批评。我有缺点和错误，能不许别人批评吗？现在社员给我贴几张大字报，咱们应该抱着欢迎的态度。即使有些大字报不完全符合事实，咱也不必忙着向群众解释。毛主席他老人家不是说过吗：‘我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理。如果怀疑这两条原理，那就什么事情也做不成了。’”经过我这么一解释，我老婆也很同意。我又说：“以后还可能把大字报往咱家里送哩，咱们得做好思想准备。如果革命群众送大字报来，咱们要全家鼓掌欢迎。我念了，你接着，让丫头拿浆子贴。”第二天，社员们果然敲锣打鼓地到我家送大字报。当时我正在饲养处打绳子，听到锣鼓声，赶快跑回家去。我们三口人照昨天晚上的计划把大字报接了，贴在墙上。
    虽然从道理上懂得，应当欢迎群众的批评，可是看到院里院外，大字报贴满了墙，我心里七上八下，很不是滋味。我想：为啥群众对我宗景太这么多意见？我心里虽然有点章程，可说句实在话，也确实感到压力不小。这时候，外边贴出了海报，说今天晚上要开大会批判我。这下子我的情绪更波动了。我想：我宗景太是贫农出身，过去在党的领导下，为群众勤勤恳恳地工作了十多年了，不说有功劳吗，可也有点苦劳。我越想越想不通。正在这时候，一抬头望见我们贫下中农的大救星毛主席他老人家慈祥的画像，我心里头就好象打开了两扇门一样，立刻浑身都有了力量。我又学习了毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”，一遍又一遍地念着：“有许多单位的负责人，对于这场伟大斗争的领导，还很不理解，很不认真，很不得力，因而处于软弱无能的地位。他们是‘怕’字当头，墨守旧的章法，不愿意打破常规，不求进取。对于群众的革命新秩序，他们感到突然，以致领导落后于形势，落后于群众。”越念心里越豁亮。我想：我决不能落后于形势，落后于群众，我要经得起这场风浪的考验。我走到饲养处，和以前一样，继续布置当天生产。饲养员张宝贵指着墙上的红纸问：“那上写的是啥？”我说：“那是开大会的海报，今天晚上要开批判我的大会。”张宝贵说：“那你还张罗个啥劲呀？”虽然张宝贵这句话刺痛了我的心，但是我想到毛主席他老人家的教导，就理直气壮地说：“晚上才开会呢，白天这一天还要象往常一样的安排生产。”说完我就把生产安排下去了。
    到了晚上，我去参加群众大会。群众问我：“大家给你贴那么多大字报，你接受得了吗？”我说：“毛主席他老人家不是说过吗：‘无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能牺牲，还有什么错误不能抛弃吗？’大家给我贴大字报，是为了帮助我改正错误，我拍手欢迎，没有什么接受不了的。”在会上，革命群众对我的缺点和错误进行了严肃的批评。后来一个贫农社员发言说：“宗景太从当队长起，搞了这么多农田基本建设，我们队的粮食产量增长了一倍还多。特别是从去年来，他领着我们大学毛主席著作，群众的阶级觉悟提高了，干劲都鼓起来了。我看他是我们的好干部。”会上，群众根据我的表现和态度，让我继续当队长，问我有什么意见。我说：“没有什么意见，只要是革命工作我就干，要不怎么算听毛主席的话？！”当时我就布置了生产任务。
    去年十月间，毛主席的最新指示下达了。毛主席的话句句说到我们心里，我越听越爱听。毛主席叫我们“斗私，批修”，我听毛主席的话，坚决同私字斗。我当了十几年干部，错误缺点是不少的，在社员大会上，我把十几年工作中的错误、缺点，一古脑儿通通地亮出来，向广大贫下中农做了检讨。社员们议论说：“宗景太认真听毛主席的话，这就行啦。”我原以为，一提到我的错误，社员一定会很气愤，想不到却得到了群众的谅解。这次生产队改选领导班子，仍然让我当队长，当时我的心情非常激动，禁不住流下了热泪。我想：我犯了那么多错误，社员还谅解我，相信我，这是对我多大的信任啊！我下决心改正自己的缺点、错误。过去我不相信群众，好批评人，不会做政治工作。这回我可改了。有什么事情都和社员耐心商量，努力做群众的小学生。
    经过两年来的文化大革命，在如何对待群众的问题上，自己受到了一次深刻的教育，对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，有了进一步的理解。广大群众的革命精神，不仅帮助干部扫除了思想上的脏东西，克服了工作中的缺点和错误，更重要的是，从根本上保证领导班子永不变色。今后，我一定遵循毛主席的教导，坚决保护和支持群众的革命精神，虚心接受群众的批评和监督，和贫下中农一起，把我们生产队的革命和生产搞得更好。
