Lake North's summer harvest crops have seen a bumper harvest. This is another new contribution made by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and community members across the province who are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought to strive for a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Currently, from the plains to the mountainous regions across the province, summer crops such as wheat, barley, beans, peas, and rapeseed have all been harvested in succession. Many counties, districts, communes, and production teams are continuously reporting the good news of balanced increases in wheat yields over large areas. Community members across various regions are enthusiastically turning in "patriot grain," selling good grain to the state, and using practical actions to support the state's socialist revolution and socialist construction.

During the summer harvest battle, the broad masses of community members, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "ensure grain production and ensure cotton production," have displayed a spirit of fearlessness in the face of fatigue and continuous combat. This has made the summer harvest work in most regions of the province this year faster in progress and better in quality compared to previous years, achieving precise harvesting and thorough threshing, with every grain accounted for.

During the summer harvest busy season, the leadership members of various levels of revolutionary committees in Lake North Province and the broad ranks of soldiers and officers from the People's Liberation Army support-left and support-agriculture units stationed in various places have all gone deep into the front lines of class struggle and production struggle in the vast rural areas, participating in the intense summer harvest battle.
