The U.S. imperialists brazenly defy the world, following in the footsteps of German and Japanese fascists, and are currently conducting large-scale research, production, and testing of inhuman chemical and biological weapons. This fully exposes their savage face as the most vicious enemy of all the people of the world.

According to reports, the United States has recently been continuously conducting large-scale tests of chemical and biological weapons in tropical areas such as the Panama Canal Zone, in the Arctic region of Greenland, and in the United States itself, in places like the Grissell Army Airfield in Alaska, Fort Huachuca in Arizona, and the Dugway Proving Ground in Utah.

The Dugway Proving Ground is located about 80 kilometers southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, and is one of the centers for the U.S. testing of chemical and biological warfare. It is closely linked with the U.S. Army Chemical Warfare Service headquarters in Edgewood and the biological warfare laboratory in Fort Detrick. The chemical and biological weapons researched and developed in these two places are all sent to the Dugway Proving Ground for testing.

These chemical and biological weapons are made into various types of shells, mines, missile warheads, and aircraft sprayers. On March 13 of this year, the Dugway Proving Ground sprayed 320 gallons of nerve gas from the air, killing 6,400 sheep in the area.

According to reports, the United States not only researches and manufactures chemical and biological weapons itself but also provides these weapons to West German militarists. According to former Pentagon reporter Seymour Hersh, "The U.S. has provided some chemical and biological warfare materials to West Germany." The Military Law Review also reported that the missiles provided by the U.S. to NATO countries "have the capability to conduct biological warfare."

It is revealed that the United States is using researchers and equipment from its domestic universities to accelerate the research on chemical and biological weapons. Currently, 52 universities, including Yale and Harvard, are participating in these evil research activities. The annual expenditure is approximately $100 million. In addition, the United States openly uses Japanese fascist militarist forces to help it carry out these evil activities. It is revealed that the United States has now signed contracts related to chemical and biological warfare with 27 universities and medical schools in Japan. For example, the U.S. has signed a contract with Keio University in Japan to research "encephalitis infection." In addition, the U.S. also uses researchers from countries such as France, Sweden, Austria, and Ireland to participate in these evil activities.

The U.S. imperialists' open and large-scale testing of chemical and biological warfare has aroused great indignation among the revolutionary people of the world and has been condemned by public opinion. No matter how frantically the U.S. imperialists implement their policies of aggression and war, they cannot escape the fate of complete annihilation.

    充分暴露出全世界人民死敌的狰狞面目
    美帝加紧制造细菌武器
    公然利用日本法西斯势力帮助进行罪恶活动
    新华社讯　华盛顿消息：美帝国主义公然冒天下之大不韪，步德日法西斯的后尘，正在大规模地加紧研究、制造和试验灭绝人性的化学武器和细菌武器，充分地暴露了它是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人的狰狞面目。
    据报道，美国最近正连续在热带的巴拿马运河区，寒带的格陵兰，以及美国国内阿拉斯加州的格里利堡、亚利桑纳州的瓦丘卡堡和犹他州的达格韦试验场等地，大规模地试验化学武器和细菌武器。
    达格韦试验场位于犹他州盐湖城西南八十公里附近，是美国试验化学战和细菌战的中心之一。它同在艾基伍德的美国陆军化学战总部和在迪特里克堡的细菌战实验室有密切的联系，在这两处研究出来的化学武器和细菌武器都运到达格韦试验场进行试验。
    这些细菌武器和化学武器制成为各种炮弹、地雷、导弹弹头和飞机上用的喷射剂。在今年三月十三日，达格韦试验场就从空中喷射了三百二十加仑神经性毒气，毒死了这个地区的六千四百头羊。
    据报道，美国不仅自己研究制造化学武器和生物武器，而且把这种武器提供给西德军国主义分子。据美国前国防部记者赫什透露，“美国已向西德提供了一些化学战和生物战物资”。《军事法评论》也报道，美国向北大西洋公约的盟国提供的导弹，“具有进行生物战的能力”。
    据透露，美国正在利用它国内高等学校的研究人员和设备，加紧研究化学武器和生物武器。目前有耶鲁大学、哈佛大学等五十二所大学参加这些罪恶的研究活动。每年的费用约为一亿美元。此外，美国还公然利用日本法西斯军国主义势力来帮助它进行这项罪恶活动。据揭露，美国现在和二十七所日本的大学和医学院订立了有关化学战和生物战的合同，例如美国就和日本的庆应义塾大学签订了研究“脑炎传染”的合同。此外美国还利用法国、瑞典、奥地利、爱尔兰等国的研究人员参与这项罪恶的活动。
    美帝国主义明目张胆地进行大规模的细菌战和化学战的试验，引起了全世界革命人民的极大愤慨和公众舆论的谴责。不管美帝国主义怎样疯狂地执行侵略政策和战争政策，它也逃脱不了彻底灭亡的命运。
