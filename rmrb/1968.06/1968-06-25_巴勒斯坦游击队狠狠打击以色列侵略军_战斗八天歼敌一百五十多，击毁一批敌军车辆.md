Palestinian guerrillas have launched approximately twenty attacks on the Israeli aggressors in occupied Arab territories in recent days, achieving new victories.

According to reports, in recent days, Palestinian guerrillas have killed or wounded more than 150 Israeli soldiers, shot down one helicopter, destroyed two tanks, fourteen other types of military vehicles, burned down an oil depot, blown up several sections of railway, one train, and two barracks.

These attacks by Palestinian guerrillas have significantly hindered the Israeli aggressors' recent concentration of forces in the Jordan River area and other places, which aimed at launching new aggressions against Arab countries.

On the 14th, Palestinian commando units shot down an Israeli helicopter, blew up an Israeli main oil pipeline, and ambushed a train heading to the Sinai Peninsula between Khan Yunis and Rafah, causing the train to derail and destroying one freight car.

On the evening of the 15th, the "Storm" commando unit, together with a guerrilla squad of the Palestine Liberation Organization, attacked an Israeli military outpost north of the Dead Sea, killing or wounding eighteen Israeli soldiers, destroying one barracks, one military vehicle, and two cannons.

On the 17th, the "Storm" commando unit laid mines on the railway near Al-Ara, between the Dead Sea and Beersheba, blowing up one freight car, derailing three freight cars into a nearby valley, and destroying a section of the railway.

The "Storm" commando unit and a guerrilla squad of the Palestine Liberation Organization jointly attacked an Israeli military camp northeast of Jericho, causing an oil depot to catch fire, killing or wounding fifteen Israeli soldiers, destroying one barracks, one military vehicle, and one cannon.

On the night of the 18th, they launched seven attacks. The "Storm" commando unit laid mines on the road leading to the Ein Aruv military camp, blowing up one patrol car and another reinforcement truck, killing or wounding all the Israeli soldiers on the vehicles.

The "Storm" commando unit also shelled the enemy positions in Hamidiya, destroying part of it, and blew up an armored car of the Israeli reinforcements, with all the soldiers on the vehicle being killed or wounded. On the same day, another guerrilla squad attacked the enemy in the vicinity of the West Bank of the Jordan River, killing twelve Israeli soldiers, and later engaging in a battle with the enemy forces concentrated there, killing or wounding fifty Israeli soldiers and destroying two tanks.

On the 19th, a "Storm" commando unit attacked Israeli soldiers near the village of Yusuf, and another "Storm" commando unit laid mines on the road leading to this area, blowing up an enemy military vehicle coming for reinforcements, with all the enemy soldiers on the vehicle being killed or wounded. Palestinian guerrillas also ambushed an Israeli patrol near Al-Ar in the Golan Heights, killing or wounding five Israeli soldiers; laid mines on the road between Dabusiya and Mumsiya in the Golan Heights, blowing up two military vehicles and killing or wounding all the enemy soldiers on the vehicles.

Another guerrilla squad ambushed in the Ondut area of the Besan Valley, killing or wounding fourteen Israeli soldiers.

On the evening of the 20th, Palestinian commando units ambushed Israeli soldiers near Um Tut, killing or wounding fourteen enemy soldiers and destroying two military vehicles.

At noon on the 21st, the "Storm" commando unit and a guerrilla squad of the Palestine Liberation Organization jointly attacked the Israeli guards on the Allenby Bridge over the Jordan River, killing all nine guards.
