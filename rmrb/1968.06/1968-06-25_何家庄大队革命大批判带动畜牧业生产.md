    Study one quote from Chairman Mao, criticize one fallacy of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, see how Chairman Mao teaches, compare how the Chinese Khrushchev poisons, and examine how you think. Hejiazhuang Brigade's revolutionary criticism promotes livestock production.

    The poor and lower-middle peasants of Hejiazhuang Brigade, Yicheng Commune, Li County, Gansu Province, have held high the banner of revolutionary criticism with Mao Zedong Thought, severely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in livestock production, greatly raising the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. They insist on using Mao Zedong Thought to guide livestock production, and the entire brigade's livestock production has taken on a new look.

    Li County is one of the major livestock breeding bases in Gansu Province. Hejiazhuang Brigade is one of the key livestock brigades in this county. Since last winter, the brigade's leading cadre has mobilized the poor and lower-middle peasants to severely criticize the set of counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in livestock production, especially the black goods of "household feeding," "production quotas per person," "work points as the commander," and "material incentives" that have the greatest influence locally, conducting special criticism. In the revolutionary criticism, the poor and lower-middle peasants put the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the first place. They study one quote from Chairman Mao, criticize one fallacy of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, see how Chairman Mao teaches, compare how the Chinese Khrushchev poisons, and examine how they think, making the revolutionary criticism deeper step by step. The revolutionary criticism has greatly raised the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines among the poor and lower-middle peasants. They have eliminated the poison of revisionism and promoted the experience of Dazhai Brigade in emphasizing proletarian politics in labor management.

    Revolutionary criticism has promoted livestock production. Last year, the brigade's livestock production achieved unprecedented development. Among them, large livestock increased by 17%, and the annual income from livestock production was more than double that of 1966.

    何家庄大队革命大批判带动畜牧业生产
    甘肃省礼县崖城公社何家庄大队广大贫下中农，高举毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在畜牧业生产上推行的反革命修正主义黑货，大大提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。他们坚持以毛泽东思想统帅畜牧业生产，全大队畜牧业生产出现了崭新局面。
    礼县是甘肃省的大家畜繁殖基地之一。何家庄大队又是这个县的畜牧业重点大队之一。去冬以来，这个大队的领导班子发动贫下中农，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在畜牧业生产上推行的一套反革命修正主义黑货，特别是对在当地影响最大的牲畜“分户喂养”、“包产到人”和“工分挂帅”、
  “物质刺激”等修正主义黑货，进行了专题批判。在革命大批判中，贫下中农把活学活用毛主席著作摆在首位。他们学一条毛主席语录，批判中国赫鲁晓夫一个反革命修正主义谬论，看一看毛主席是怎样教导的，比一比中国赫鲁晓夫是怎样放毒的，查一查自己是怎样想的，使革命大批判步步深入。革命的大批判，大大提高了贫下中农阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，他们清除修正主义的流毒，推广了大寨大队突出无产阶级政治的劳动管理经验。
    革命大批判带动了畜牧业生产。去年，这个大队的畜牧业生产获得了空前发展，其中大家畜净增百分之十七，全年畜牧业收入比一九六六年增长两倍多。
