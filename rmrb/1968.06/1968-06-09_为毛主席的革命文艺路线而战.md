	Fighting for Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line in the Arts
	People's Liberation Army Navy East Sea Fleet Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team

	"The sea voyage relies on the helmsman, revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Our Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team's arts troupe has deeply felt in over a year of revolutionary practice that being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in the arts is the soul of revolutionary arts warriors and the fundamental principle of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team.

	Loyalty to Chairman Mao is the fundamental principle of the Propaganda Team

	When our small team was first established, many comrades thought: we are soldiers with guns, we can't do arts. Some said, our skills are low, our techniques are poor, to achieve something, we need a few pillars who can sing and dance. From the beginning, we faced the question of whether to organize the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team and what to rely on to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. Based on Chairman Mao's teachings on "class struggle, grasp it and it works," we first organized everyone to engage in revolutionary criticism and struggle. Through remembrance and comparison, recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness, we launched fierce attacks on the capitalist roaders in power within the Party and the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in the arts. In the criticism, we exposed the wolfish ambitions of China's Khrushchev, and severely criticized the heinous crimes of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party who madly opposed Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. China's Khrushchev and counter-revolutionary revisionists like Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan madly opposed singing the praises of our great leader Chairman Mao. They wickedly defamed and blocked the great Mao Zedong Thought, but opened the door wide for ghosts and monsters, emperors and generals, and other revisionist goods. Chairman Mao taught us: "To overthrow a political power, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this." The handful of capitalist roaders within the Party were so arrogant in creating counter-revolutionary public opinion, attempting to restore capitalism. Could we revolutionary soldiers stand by and do nothing? Absolutely not! We revolutionary soldiers must be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao. We resolutely wield the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, cleanse the poison of revisionism; raise the red flag, chop off the black line, and vigorously sing the praises of Chairman Mao's brilliant leadership, vigorously propagate the invincible Mao Zedong Thought; create revolutionary public opinion, and seize back all propaganda positions for the revolutionary soldiers of the proletariat. The class enemy opposes us learning and propagating Mao Zedong Thought, but we will learn Mao Zedong Thought for a lifetime and propagate Mao Zedong Thought for a lifetime. Loyalty to Chairman Mao is the fundamental principle of our Propaganda Team.

	Through remembrance and comparison, recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness, through studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, we further ignited our deep proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is our great savior, Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline, propagating and defending Mao Zedong Thought is our sacred duty as revolutionary soldiers. Although we lack performance techniques, we have an infinitely loyal heart to Chairman Mao, a revolutionary spirit, and if we have a mouth, we can sing; if we have hands, we can dance; if we have legs, we can jump. No matter how many difficulties there are, they cannot defeat revolutionary soldiers who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. If we lack programs, we create our own; if we lack music, we write our own; everyone is an actor, everyone is a director. Some comrades, to keep up with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, often forget to eat when hurriedly creating programs and neglect to sleep. One soldier, while writing a program late at night, was already very tired, but as soon as he thought of his family's bitter history, his fatigue disappeared. His family had been laborers for the landlords for three generations, his grandfather and father died from overwork, and he himself, from a young age, begged for food with his mother, enduring wind and rain, living a life worse than cattle and horses. It was Chairman Mao who saved us from the sea of bitterness. China's Khrushchev, however, dared to attempt a counter-revolution, wanting us to suffer twice. Absolutely not! With this, we, with our infinite love for Chairman Mao and our boundless hatred for China's Khrushchev, actively propagated the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We turned the stage into a battlefield and opened fire on the revisionist arts black line.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao taught us: "We must defeat the enemy, first relying on the army with guns. But having only this kind of army is not enough, we must also have a cultural army, which is an indispensable force for uniting ourselves and defeating the enemy." Vice Chairman Lin said: "Gun barrels, pen barrels, seizing power relies on these two barrels." However, China's Khrushchev and his agents in the arts, such as Zhou Yang, Lin Moquan, and Xia Yan, used the arts to launch a rampant attack on us, creating counter-revolutionary public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. In the face of the class enemy's rampant attack, could we revolutionary soldiers stand idly by? "The heavenly soldiers' anger soars to the heavens, a ten-thousand-foot rope to bind the rocs," we must storm the stage, seize the arts power, occupy all propaganda positions, turn the stage into a battlefield, and open fire on the revisionist arts black line!

	Chairman Mao taught us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism, it is revolution." We must break away from the bourgeois arts black line and reactionary rules and regulations, and establish Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in the arts, creating new arts that serve proletarian politics. China's Khrushchev, however, advocated for "art appreciation," absurdly saying that "everyone watches the play" and gets "a good rest" is enough. The stage previously controlled by a handful of capitalist roaders in power within the Party was serving these reactionary views of China's Khrushchev. For example, some crosstalk programs went to great lengths to ridicule the working people and distort the images of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Under the guise of "light and cheerful," they "exposed" the so-called "dark side" of socialism, attempting to corrupt the masses' thoughts with laughter, conquer hearts, and pave the way for the restoration of capitalism. We severely criticized China's Khrushchev's fallacies, broke away from the old crosstalk frameworks, and created new crosstalk programs in new forms, such as "Comrade Guo, the Platoon Leader, Studies 'In Memory of Norman Bethune' Three Times" and "Mao Zedong Thought Cultivates New People," which showed the glorious thoughts of revolutionary soldiers who dedicate themselves to the public and to the people, and were warmly welcomed by the audience. The audience reflected: "These programs are novel in form, highlight proletarian politics, have great educational significance, and can promote our thought revolutionization."

	Chairman Mao taught us: "The Party's arts work ... is to serve the revolutionary tasks prescribed by the Party in a certain revolutionary period." However, China's Khrushchev, Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, and other counter-revolutionary revisionists advocated for the theory of "indirect coordination," wanting us to deviate from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in the arts and from the real class struggle. We firmly do not agree! Our Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments and serve proletarian politics. Our Propaganda Team, to coordinate with the current class struggle, created and performed programs, achieving quick creation and quick performance, light equipment on stage, and taking the show to the doorstep. For example, after the news of our country's successful detonation of the first hydrogen bomb was published, we immediately created and performed a program on the way to the performance, and that day, we met with the audience, conveying this heart-stirring good news to the masses and receiving warm welcome from the masses.

	In performance, we tempered the character of "loyalty."

	To propagate Mao Zedong Thought well, we must first study and apply Mao Zedong Thought well. The small team's Party branch firmly grasped the daily reading and daily use. We often used the method of small rectification to study and apply the "Three Articles," held struggle sessions to criticize and repudiate private thoughts, thoroughly uproot the roots of revisionism, and fundamentally transform our worldview, consciously placing the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and more important than everything.

	In propaganda performances, we followed Chairman Mao's teachings, faced the workers, peasants, and soldiers, served the workers, peasants, and soldiers, learned from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and tempered our red hearts in the class struggle and propaganda practice. We propagated Mao Zedong Thought without asking about stage conditions, performing with a stage or without a stage; without asking about time and place, whether day or night, far or near, island or countryside, we performed wherever needed; without asking about the number of people, performing for thousands or for a few with the same enthusiasm; regardless of good or bad weather, we insisted on performing. We used Mao Zedong Thought to inspire the revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary masses; the revolutionary enthusiasm of the revolutionary masses inspired us to fight better. Once, we performed on a small island. This island was far from the mainland, with inconvenient transportation. We carried our instruments and drums, climbed mountains and crossed ridges, walking tens of miles back and forth, but not a single person complained. The masses warmly welcomed our performance. Some masses, to watch the performance, came from islands tens of miles away. We performed each program, and they cheered "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years of Chairman Mao!" An elderly poor peasant in his sixties, with tears in his eyes, said to us: "What you say, sing, and perform are all the words of Chairman Mao. Every word touches our hearts. We listen more and more, and we watch more and more." The deep proletarian feelings of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants for Chairman Mao deeply educated us.

	In the early performances, some of our programs lacked fighting spirit and the atmosphere was not intense. On stage, we always felt like we were acting, lacking genuine emotions. The Party branch, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings of "There is no love without reason, nor hatred without reason," organized everyone to recall and compare, engage in revolutionary criticism and struggle. This further deepened our love for Chairman Mao and strengthened our hatred for China's Khrushchev. Because our emotions changed, the effect was different. In the program "Heart-to-Heart Talk" performed on the dizi, the theme was to denounce the evil old society and refute China's Khrushchev's fallacy of "exploitation is meritorious." At the beginning of the rehearsal, the performer did not express enough hatred for the old society. Later, they recalled their bitterness, and on stage, as soon as they thought of their father being a "laborer" in the old society, carrying several hundred jin of heavy bags on his back, staggering under the whip of the foreman, they were filled with hatred for the old society. Sometimes, they were so moved that their tears wet the dizi membrane, and they cried so much that they couldn't play. Many audience members also shed tears. A dock worker, after watching it, excitedly said: "In the old society, we were beasts of burden for the capitalists, enduring endless beatings from the foremen. And China's Khrushchev absurdly said 'exploitation is meritorious,' truly nonsense! You are not playing the dizi, you are denouncing! You gave me a vivid class education lesson." The instrumental ensemble "Beat the Fallen Dogs" often erupted in waves of "Down with China's Khrushchev" slogans when reaching the climax. The performance venue immediately turned into a criticism and struggle session. "Awaken thousands and tens of thousands of workers and peasants, unite and fight." Our performances aroused the deep hatred of the broad masses for China's Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line, playing an educational role for the people and striking the enemy.

    为毛主席的革命文艺路线而战
    中国人民解放军海军东海舰队某部毛泽东思想宣传队
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”我们这支毛泽东思想宣传队文艺小分队在一年多来的革命实践中，深深体会到无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛主席的革命文艺路线，是革命文艺战士的灵魂，是毛泽东思想宣传队的根本。
    忠于毛主席是宣传队的根本
    我们小分队初建时，不少同志认为：我们是拿枪杆子的，搞不了文艺。有的说，咱水平低，技术差，要搞出点名堂来，没有几个能唱会跳的台柱子不行。一开始就面临着要不要组织毛泽东思想宣传队，宣传毛泽东思想靠什么的问题。根据毛主席“阶级斗争，一抓就灵”的教导，我们首先组织大家开展革命大批判。通过回忆对比，忆苦思甜，向党内走资本主义道路当权派、向反革命修正主义文艺黑线猛烈开火。在批判中，大揭中国赫鲁晓夫的狼子野心，大批党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派疯狂反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想的滔天罪行。中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿之流，疯狂地反对歌颂我们伟大领袖毛主席。他们丧心病狂地诋毁和封锁伟大的毛泽东思想，却给牛鬼蛇神、帝王将相等修正主义货色大开方便之门。毛主席教导我们说：“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”党内一小撮走资派如此猖狂地大肆制造反革命舆论，妄图搞资本主义复辟，我们革命战士能视而不见，不闻不问吗？不能！绝对不能！我们革命战士，就是要无限忠于毛主席，绝对忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛主席。我们坚决奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，肃清修正主义的流毒；举红旗，斩黑线，大力歌颂毛主席的英明领导，大力宣传战无不胜的毛泽东思想；大造革命的舆论，把一切宣传阵地通通夺回我们无产阶级革命战士手中。阶级敌人反对我们学习和宣传毛泽东思想，我们就是要学习一辈子毛泽东思想，宣传一辈子毛泽东思想。忠于毛主席，是我们宣传队的根本。
    通过回忆对比，忆苦思甜，通过活学活用毛泽东思想，更加激发了我们对毛主席深厚的无产阶级感情。毛主席是我们的大救星，毛泽东思想是我们的命根子，宣传和捍卫毛泽东思想，是我们革命战士的神圣职责。我们虽然没有表演技巧，但是，我们有一颗无限忠于毛主席的赤胆忠心，有一股子革命闯劲，有嘴就能唱，有手就能舞，有腿就能跳，困难再多，绝对难不倒无限忠于毛主席的革命战士。没有节目我们自己编，没有曲子我们自己写，人人是演员，大家当导演。有的同志为了紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，赶编节目常常忘掉吃饭，顾不得睡觉。有位战士在深夜编写节目时，已经很困倦了，但是，他一想起自己的苦难家史，倦意就消失了。他家祖辈三代给地主扛长工，祖父和父亲活活累死，自己从小跟母亲要饭，风里来雨里去，过着牛马不如的生活。是毛主席他老人家，把我们从苦海里救了出来。中国的赫鲁晓夫却妄想变天，要我们受二遍苦，绝对办不到！就这样，我们怀着对毛主席无限热爱的阶级感情，怀着对中国赫鲁晓夫无比仇恨，积极地宣传战无不胜的毛泽东思想。把舞台当战场向修正主义开炮
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“我们要战胜敌人，首先要依靠手里拿枪的军队。但是仅仅有这种军队是不够的，我们还要有文化的军队，这是团结自己、战胜敌人必不可少的一支军队。”林副统帅说：“枪杆子、笔杆子，夺取政权靠这两杆子。”但是中国赫鲁晓夫及其在文艺界的代理人周扬、林默涵、夏衍等一小撮反革命修正主义分子，利用文艺向我们发动了猖狂的进攻，为复辟资本主义大造反革命舆论。在阶级敌人的猖狂进攻面前，我们革命战士岂能袖手旁观？“天兵怒气冲霄汉”，“万丈长缨要把鲲鹏缚”，我们就是要杀上舞台，夺回文艺大权，占领一切宣传阵地，把舞台当战场，向修正主义文艺黑线猛烈开火！
    毛主席教导我们说：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。”我们就是要破除资产阶级文艺黑线和反动的条条框框，大立毛主席的革命文艺路线，创造为无产阶级政治服务的新文艺。中国的赫鲁晓夫却鼓吹艺术“欣赏”，胡说什么“大家看了戏”，得到“好好休息”就行了。过去被党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所控制的舞台，就是为中国赫鲁晓夫的这些反动观点服务的。例如有些相声节目，极尽丑化劳动人民、歪曲工农兵形象之能事。它们以“轻松愉快”为幌子，来“暴露”所谓社会主义的“阴暗面”，企图用说说笑笑来腐蚀群众的思想，征服人心，为资本主义复辟鸣锣开道。我们狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的谬论，打破了旧相声的框框，以新的形式创作了《郭班长三学〈为人民服务〉》、《毛泽东思想育新人》等相声节目，表现了革命战士一心为公，一心为人民的光辉思想，得到了观众热烈欢迎。观众反映说：“这些节目形式新颖，突出了无产阶级政治，教育意义大，能促进我们的思想革命化。”
    毛主席教导我们说：“党的文艺工作，……是服从党在一定革命时期内所规定的革命任务的。”而中国赫鲁晓夫、陆定一、周扬等一小撮反革命修正主义分子却提倡什么“间接配合”论，要我们脱离毛主席的革命文艺路线，脱离现实的阶级斗争，我们坚决不答应！我们毛泽东思想宣传队就是要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，为无产阶级政治服务。我们这个宣传队为了配合当前的阶级斗争，自编自演，作到了快编快演，轻装上台，送戏上门。如我国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功的消息发表后，早晨听到广播，我们立即编演了节目，在出发的路上，一边修改，一边对词，当天就与观众见面了，把这一振奋人心的喜讯传给了广大群众，受到了广大群众的热烈欢迎。
    在演出中锤炼一个“忠”字
    要宣传好毛泽东思想，必须首先学好用好毛泽东思想。小分队党支部狠抓了天天读，天天用。我们经常以小整风的方法，大学大用“老三篇”，召开斗私批修讲用会，狠斗私字，猛挖修根，彻底改造世界观，自觉地把活学活用毛泽东思想放在高于一切，大于一切，先于一切，重于一切的位置。
    在宣传演出中，我们遵照毛主席的教导，面向工农兵，为工农兵服务，向工农兵学习，在阶级斗争和宣传实践当中锤炼红心。我们宣传毛泽东思想不讲舞台条件，有台演，无台也演；不讲时间地点，无论白天还是晚上，路远还是路近，海岛还是农村，哪里需要就到哪里演；不讲人多人少，上千人看和几个人看同样演；不管天气好坏都坚持演。我们用毛泽东思想去鼓舞革命群众的斗志；革命群众的革命豪情又鼓舞我们更好地战斗。有一次我们到一个小岛上演出，这个岛离陆地较远，交通不便，自己背乐器，抬锣鼓，爬山越岭，来回要走二三十里路，但是没有一个人叫苦。群众对我们的演出非常欢迎，有的群众为了看演出从十几里外的岛上赶来，我们每演一个节目，他们都欢呼毛主席万岁，毛主席万万岁！一位六十多岁的贫农老大爷，含着热泪对我们说：“你们说的、唱的、演的，都是毛主席他老人家的话，句句说到我们的心坎里，我们越听越爱听，越看越爱看。”广大贫下中农无限忠于毛主席的深厚阶级感情，深深地教育了我们。
    最初几次演出，我们有些节目战斗性不强，气氛不浓。在台上演出，总感到是在演戏，缺乏真实感情。党支部遵照伟大领袖毛主席“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨”的教导，组织大家回忆对比，进行革命的大批判、大控诉。从而进一步加深了对毛主席的热爱，增强了对中国赫鲁晓夫的仇恨。由于感情变了，效果就不一样了。笛子演奏《谈心》这个节目，主题是控诉万恶的旧社会，驳斥中国赫鲁晓夫“剥削有功”的谬论。开始排练时，演员在表演中对旧社会的刻骨仇恨表现得不够，后来他们通过忆苦，在台上一想起父亲在旧社会当“苦力”，成年累月背上扛着几百斤重的大包，在工头的皮鞭下蹒跚移步的悲惨情景，就充满了对旧社会的仇恨，有时激动得泪水把笛膜打湿了，哭得吹不下去了，很多观众也流下了眼泪。一位码头工人看了后激动地说：“我们在旧社会给资本家做牛做马，受尽了工头皮鞭的毒打。而中国赫鲁晓夫却胡说什么‘剥削有功’，真是胡说八道！你们不是在吹笛子，是在控诉！给我上了一堂生动的阶级教育课。”乐器小合奏《痛打落水狗》这个节目，往往演奏到高潮时，台上台下都爆发出一阵阵“打倒中国赫鲁晓夫”的口号声。演出的会场立刻变成了批判会、控诉会。“唤起工农千百万，同心干”。我们的演出激起了广大群众对中国赫鲁晓夫资产阶级反动路线的刻骨仇恨，起到了教育人民、打击敌人的作用。
