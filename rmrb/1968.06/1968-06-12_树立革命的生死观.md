The great leader Chairman Mao has always taught us to establish a proletarian worldview and to correctly handle the issues of life and death. Chairman Mao said: "To struggle means to make sacrifices, and deaths are always occurring. But we think of the people's interests, of the suffering of the great majority, and we die for the people—we die as we should." Chairman Mao's brilliant teachings are the view on life and death for every revolutionary soldier.

However, China's Khrushchev openly advocates a philosophy of self-preservation, saying things like "cherish oneself, protect one's life and health," attempting to turn our revolutionary soldiers into cowards who fear death.

The heroic deeds of Comrade Meng Hetong, who is loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, provide a powerful critique of China's Khrushchev's philosophy of self-preservation.

Comrade Meng Hetong's brilliant achievements are a triumphant song of Mao Zedong Thought, setting a shining example for every revolutionary soldier to establish a revolutionary view on life and death. As long as we follow his example, thinking of Chairman Mao gives us the greatest strength, following Chairman Mao gives us the greatest wisdom and courage, and following Chairman Mao closely is victory, and fighting for Chairman Mao is happiness. Once, our crew was on a mission when the plane suddenly dropped from 10,000 meters to 7,000 meters at a speed of over 100 meters per second. The maps and documents were thrown up, and people were thrown out of their seats, unable to move or communicate with the outside, in a very dangerous situation. What should we do? If we followed China's Khrushchev's reactionary logic, "cherish oneself," "protect one's life and health," we would only abandon the plane and parachute to save ourselves. But we are revolutionary soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought. We see Chairman Mao's brilliant image in the cockpit and think of Chairman Mao's teaching: "Resolutely fight, be unafraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." Therefore, we have only one thought: the plane stays, we stay. Relying on Mao Zedong Thought, we handled this unexpected situation well and ensured flight safety.

We must actively respond to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's great call, launch a wave of learning from Comrade Meng Hetong's brilliant deeds, learn from Comrade Meng Hetong's lofty qualities of being loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and thoroughly criticize and expose China's Khrushchev's philosophy of self-preservation. We must be like Comrade Meng, "always standing guard for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, fighting bravely to defend Chairman Mao, and willingly sacrificing ourselves for Chairman Mao."

    树立革命的生死观
    空军学习毛主席著作积极分子、某部大队副政委　陈树尧
    伟大统帅毛主席一贯教导我们，树立无产阶级的世界观，正确对待生和死的问题。毛主席说：“要奋斗就会有牺牲，死人的事是经常发生的。但是我们想到人民的利益，想到大多数人民的痛苦，我们为人民而死，就是死得其所。”毛主席的这一光辉教导，就是我们每个革命战士的生死观。
    可是，中国的赫鲁晓夫却公然鼓吹活命哲学，说什么“钟爱自己，保护自己的生命与健康”，妄图使我们革命战士变成贪生怕死的胆小鬼。
    无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部门合同志的英雄行为，给了中国赫鲁晓夫活命哲学有力的批判。
    门合同志的光辉事迹，是一曲毛泽东思想的凯歌，为我们每个革命战士确定革命的生死观树立了光辉榜样。只要象他那样，一切想着毛主席就有最大的力量，一切服从毛主席就有最大的智慧和勇敢，一切紧跟毛主席就是胜利，一切为着毛主席就是幸福。一次，我们机组在执行任务时，飞机突然以每秒一百多米的速度从一万米高空掉到七千米，地图文件被抛起，人也被抛离了座椅，一时动弹不了，也不能和外面通话，情况十分危急。怎么办呢？如果按照中国赫鲁晓夫的反动逻辑，“钟爱自己”，“保护自己的生命与健康”，就只有抛弃飞机，跳伞逃命。可是，我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，看到的是座舱里的毛主席的光辉形象，想到的是毛主席的“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，因此，心里只有一个念头，人在飞机在。我们依靠毛泽东思想，很好地处理了这次意外发生的情况，保证了飞行安全。
    我们一定要积极响应毛主席和党中央的伟大号召，掀起学习门合同志光辉事迹的热潮，学习门合同志无限忠于毛主席革命路线的崇高品质，彻底批倒批臭中国赫鲁晓夫的活命哲学。要象门合那样，“时刻为毛主席的革命路线放好哨，站好岗，打好仗”。生为保卫毛主席勇敢战斗，死为保卫毛主席自觉献身。
