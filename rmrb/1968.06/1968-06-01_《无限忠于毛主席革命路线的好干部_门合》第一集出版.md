Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao personally approved the order issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to posthumously confer on Comrade Meng He the glorious title of "Ever-Loyal Cadre to Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line." This sets a shining example for all Party members, the entire army, revolutionary cadres across the nation, and the broad revolutionary masses.

To meet the needs of the broad revolutionary masses in studying Comrade Meng He's glorious deeds, the People's Publishing House has published the first volume of "The Ever-Loyal Cadre to Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line - Meng He." This volume includes the order issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, the editorial "Defending Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line is the Sacred Duty of Revolutionary Cadres" from the *Liberation Army Daily*, and the joint report "The Ever-Loyal Cadre to Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line - Meng He" written by reporters and correspondents from the *Qinghai Daily*, *Liberation Army Daily*, and Xinhua News Agency. Starting June 2nd, it will be available at the Xinhua Bookstore in Beijing and will soon be available at Xinhua Bookstores nationwide.
