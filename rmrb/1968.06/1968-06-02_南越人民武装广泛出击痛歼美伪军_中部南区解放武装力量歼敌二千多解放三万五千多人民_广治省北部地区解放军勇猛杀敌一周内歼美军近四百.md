South Vietnamese people's armed forces have launched widespread attacks, inflicting heavy casualties on U.S. and puppet forces. In the southern central region, the liberation armed forces have annihilated over 2,000 enemy troops, including one-third being U.S. aggressors and their lackeys. They have also destroyed numerous enemy strongholds, outposts, and "strategic hamlets," liberating over 35,000 people.

During this period, the enemy's various military centers and important transportation lines connecting the plains and mountains have been continuously disrupted by the people's liberation armed forces and local residents. In the southern central region, military and civilians have attacked a series of enemy strongholds on the 1st Highway from Ninh Thuan to Phu Yen, the 8th Highway from Ma Linh to Phan Rang, the 11th Highway in Phu Yen Province, the 20th Highway from Da Lat to Lam Dong, and the 21st Highway from De Chu to Da Lat. They have seized important enemy transportation hubs and blown up numerous bridges.

According to a report from the Vietnam South Liberation Communication Agency, the liberation army in the northern region of Quang Tri Province, from May 19 to 25, annihilated nearly 400 U.S. aggressors, completely wiping out three U.S. platoons and severely damaging five companies.

The report states that on May 19, the liberation army launched a fierce assault on U.S. aggressors who had been air-dropped into the Huu River area, killing 100 enemy troops. On May 21 and 22, the liberation army annihilated 60 invading U.S. troops in the Sa Ma area and 198 U.S. troops in the Phu Nha area.

On the morning of May 25, at 8 AM and 9 AM, the liberation army intercepted the enemy in the Er River area, completely wiping out two U.S. platoons. Shortly after, at 11 AM, they launched a fierce attack on a U.S. company that came to reinforce the area, nearly annihilating the entire company. The enemy, unwilling to accept defeat, air-dropped two more U.S. companies into the area that evening. The liberation army infantry, in close coordination with artillery, bravely charged into the enemy ranks. After more than two hours of intense battle, they nearly annihilated these two U.S. companies.

In the area north of Dong Ha Base, on May 25, the liberation army intercepted a U.S. company advancing towards the Da Do area, completely wiping out an enemy platoon.
