Class struggle does not "extinguish," and class struggle cannot "extinguish." Every step forward in the socialist revolution and socialist construction on our Zhamai grasslands has been achieved through struggles against class enemies. We must—

March forward against the storms of class struggle.

Qū Shā Bō Máo (Tibetan), Militia Squad Leader, Dongfeng Commune, Angsai Township, Zado County, Qinghai Province

The sun that shines brightest in the hearts of all ethnic groups in our country, Chairman Mao, teaches us: "Throughout the transitional period, there are class contradictions, there is class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and there is a struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism." Chairman Mao's teachings are the absolute truth. On our Zhamai grasslands, intense class struggles have never stopped. Every step forward our broad masses of impoverished herdsmen have taken on the socialist path has been the result of fierce struggles against landlords, headmen, and other exploiters. However, China's Khrushchev loudly proclaims that "class struggle has basically ended," "it is not necessary to take fierce struggles," "it is possible to enter socialism peacefully," and so on. This is all poison to numb our fighting spirit.

Since liberation, our Zhamai herdsmen, along with the people of the entire country, have embarked on the path of collectivization. In 1958, under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, we established people's communes. We rebelled against those landlords and headmen, seized back the pastures they had long occupied, and divided up the cattle, sheep, and tents they had extorted from us. Those evil spirits ground their teeth in anger. Some of them kept accounts of the changing times, while others cursed us through prayers. Faced with such fierce counterattacks from class enemies, how could we not need to take fierce struggles?

In 1963, just as China's Khrushchev was spreading the "three freedoms and one contract" evil wind, a small clique of capitalist roaders within the Qinghai Provincial Party was plotting to implement the "contract production to households" scheme in our Zado County. They sent work teams to collude with landlords and headmen, pushing hard for a capitalist restoration. They rambled on about how "contract production to households" could increase cattle and sheep production and solve difficulties, thereby forcing us to distribute the collective's cattle and sheep to households. Seeing the collective economy being dismantled, our impoverished herdsmen felt as if our hearts were being cut out. But those landlords and headmen were grinning from ear to ear, delighted beyond measure. They said, "It's better for everyone to do their own thing," "Our cattle and sheep have returned!" Look, isn't this clear evidence of class struggle? Where is there any sign of it "extinguishing"?

At this critical moment, we, the broad masses of impoverished herdsmen, firmly remembered Chairman Mao's great teachings: "Never forget class struggle." We carried out "bitter memories, sweet present" activities, further raising our class struggle awareness. We resolutely fought against the small clique of capitalist roaders within the party, as well as the landlords and headmen, and finally repelled this "contract production to households" evil wind, returning the cattle and sheep to the production teams for raising. Over the past four years, the number of cattle and sheep has increased nearly tenfold, fully demonstrating the superiority of the collective economy and the socialist system. But every step forward we have taken, we have had to repeatedly struggle against class enemies. China's Khrushchev's nonsense about "being able to enter socialism peacefully" will never deceive us, the broad masses of impoverished herdsmen who have fought on the front lines of class struggle.

Faced with such a long-term, sharp, and complex class struggle, why does China's Khrushchev repeatedly shout that "class struggle has basically ended" and "it is not necessary to take fierce struggles"? The people of Zhamai have long seen through his black heart. He wants to use this smokescreen to protect landlords, headmen, and a small clique of capitalist roaders, to carry out a capitalist restoration, and to once again trample us, the broad masses of herdsmen, underfoot like boots. China's Khrushchev, this scoundrel, chants "Amitabha" with his mouth while sharpening his knife with his hands, plotting to make us forget the blood and tears of the old society and the class struggle in the midst of a chorus of "peace" and "extinguishing" prayers, so that they can seize the opportunity to pounce on us, eat our flesh, and drink our blood! These guys are no different from wolves in sheep's clothing!

The road we have traveled has vividly educated us: the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes has been fiercely ongoing, and to advance, we must struggle. We, the Tibetan herdsmen with a glorious revolutionary tradition, will definitely always follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, unceasingly and proactively launch attacks on class enemies, bravely march forward against the storms of class struggle, and advance victoriously on the broad road of socialism!

    阶级斗争没有“熄灭”，阶级斗争不可能“熄灭”。我们札美草原上社会主义革命和社会主义建设的每一步前进，都是在同阶级敌人搏斗中取得的。我们要——
    迎着阶级斗争的暴风雨前进
    青海省扎多县昂赛乡东风公社民兵排长　曲沙波毛（藏族）
    全国各族人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席教导我们：“整个过渡时期存在着阶级矛盾、存在着无产阶级和资产阶级的阶级斗争、存在着社会主义和资本主义的两条道路斗争。”毛主席的教导是千真万确的真理。在我们札美草原上，激烈的阶级斗争就从来没有停止过。我们广大贫苦牧民，在社会主义的大道上每前进一步，都是同牧主、头人等剥削者进行激烈斗争的结果。中国赫鲁晓夫却扯起嗓子叫嚷“阶级斗争已经基本上结束了”，“可以不需要采取激烈的斗争”，“可以和平进入社会主义”等等，这完全是麻痹我们斗争意志的毒药。
    解放以来，我们札美牧民和全国人民一道，走上了合作化的道路。一九五八年，我们在伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，办起了人民公社。造了那些牧主、头人的反，夺回了他们长期霸占的草山，分了他们从我们身上压榨、剥削得来的牛羊和帐篷。那些恶鬼们气得把牙齿磨得格格响。他们有的记下了变天账，有的借念经咒骂我们。面对阶级敌人这样猖狂的反扑，我们怎么能“不需要采取激烈的斗争”了呢？
    一九六三年，正当中国赫鲁晓夫刮起一股“三自一包”妖风的时候，青海省党内一小撮走资派在我们扎多县大搞“包产到户”的阴谋活动。他们派出工作组和牧主、头人勾结在一起，大搞资本主义复辟。他们胡说什么“包产到户”可以增产牛羊，解决困难，从而强迫我们把集体的牛羊分配到户。眼看集体经济被拆散，我们贫苦牧民心里真象刀剜一样地痛。但那些牧主、头人却眉开眼笑，乐得心里开了花。他们说：“还是各干各的好”，“我们的牛羊又回来了！”看，这不分明是阶级斗争吗？哪里有半点要“熄灭”的迹象呢？
    就在这关键时刻，我们广大贫苦牧民牢记毛主席他老人家“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，进行了忆苦思甜活动，进一步提高了阶级斗争觉悟。我们同党内一小撮走资派以及牧主、头人等进行了坚决的斗争，终于击退了这股“包产到户”的妖风，重新把牛羊收回生产队饲养。四年多来，牛羊增长了将近十倍，充分显示了集体经济和社会主义制度的优越性。但这每一步的前进，我们都得和阶级敌人进行反复的搏斗。中国赫鲁晓夫胡说什么“可以和平进入社会主义”，这套鬼话永远骗不了我们从阶级斗争火线上搏斗过来的广大贫苦牧民。
    面对这样长期的、尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，中国赫鲁晓夫为什么要一再叫嚷“阶级斗争基本结束”，
  “可以不需要采取激烈的斗争”呢？我们札美牧民早就把他的黑心看穿了。他就是要在这种烟幕底下，掩护牧主、头人和一小撮走资派，搞资本主义复辟，再把我们广大牧民当靴子一样，踩在脚下。中国赫鲁晓夫这个家伙，嘴里念着阿弥陀佛，手里却霍霍磨刀，阴谋让我们在一片“和平”、“熄灭”的诵经念佛声中，忘记旧社会的血泪仇，忘记阶级斗争，以便他们乘机猛扑过来，吃我们的肉，喝我们的血！这些家伙跟披着羊皮的狼有什么两样？
    我们走过的道路，活生生地教育了我们：无产阶级同资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的斗争，一直在激烈地进行着，要前进，必须斗争。我们有着光荣革命传统的藏族牧民，一定永远紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，不停顿地、主动地向阶级敌人进攻，勇敢地迎着阶级斗争的暴风雨，在社会主义的康庄大道上乘胜前进！
