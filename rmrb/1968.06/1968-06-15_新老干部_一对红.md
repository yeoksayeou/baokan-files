New and Old Cadres "A Pair of Reds"

It was deep into the night, but the office of the Revolutionary Committee of Fenglin People's Commune in the suburbs of Weihai City, Shandong Province, was still brightly lit. The head of the Revolutionary Committee, Cai Niantian, and the revolutionary mass representative and committee member Song Wenxiu, were deeply engrossed in studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and sharing their insights. People often referred to them as a "pair of reds."

When the Revolutionary Committee was first established and Song Wenxiu was appointed as a committee member, Cai Niantian initially looked down on this "young girl." Song Wenxiu, on the other hand, thought: Cai Niantian is the former deputy secretary of the commune's old Party committee and had carried out the bourgeois reactionary line. I had rebelled against him in the past, and now we are working together. I'm afraid our relationship won't be good. So, the two of them were always at odds with each other.

Chairman Mao said: "Running study classes is a good method. Many problems can be solved in study classes." They brought their problems to the study class and repeatedly engaged in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, studying Chairman Mao's teachings over and over again: "If our Party does not have a large number of new cadres cooperating with the old cadres, our cause will be interrupted." "New and old cadres should respect each other, learn from each other, complement each other's strengths and weaknesses, so as to unite as one and carry out a common cause, and prevent sectarian tendencies." During the study, Cai Niantian recalled the bitter history of his family's three generations of begging in the old society. As soon as he finished speaking, Song Wenxiu, with tears streaming down her face, said painfully: "In the past, we were all bitter gourds on the same vine. It was the bourgeois reactionary line that separated us. It was Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line that saved us. Today, Chairman Mao has entrusted us with the 'power.' But I..."

Before Song Wenxiu could finish, Cai Niantian took over and said: "Our hearts are not connected because the 'self' has bewitched our minds. If we do not thoroughly overcome our selfishness, we cannot hold power and use it well, which is disloyal to Chairman Mao." Then, he voluntarily criticized himself for not believing in the masses. Song Wenxiu also criticized herself for seeing more mistakes and shortcomings in old cadres in the past and fewer strengths and advantages. The more they talked, the closer they became, and the more they understood each other. Thus, they voluntarily formed a pair to help and learn from each other. From then on, whenever they discovered each other's strengths, they would humbly learn from them, and whenever they found weaknesses, they would boldly criticize and help each other warmly.

Song Wenxiu was active and daring in her work, but she was not humble enough in accepting the masses' opinions, often seeing herself as a revolutionary force rather than a revolutionary target. After Cai Niantian discovered this problem, he took the initiative to talk to her, telling her that one of the main reasons for his past mistakes was that he only demanded that the masses obey him and was unwilling to learn from them. Over time, he became alienated from the masses. He encouraged Song Wenxiu to firmly follow Chairman Mao's words, correctly treat herself, and correctly treat the masses. Not only should she reform others, but she should also reform herself and always be a student of the masses.

Cai Niantian worked steadily and diligently, but because he was afraid of making mistakes again, he was somewhat hesitant. Seeing this, Song Wenxiu took the initiative to help Cai Niantian fight against selfishness and criticism of revisionism, helping him replace the "fear" with "dare," increasing his confidence and courage, making him more serious and responsible in his work, and daring to fully play to his strengths.

Just at this time, the bad elements hiding in the dark corners crawled out and spread a stink, saying that "the head of the Revolutionary Committee must listen to the 'little yellow-haired girl'." After hearing this, Cai Niantian found Song Wenxiu to talk. He said: "Song Wenxiu, what do you think of these words?" Song Wenxiu replied firmly: "This is the class enemy's attempt to sow discord between new and old cadres and to sabotage the revolutionary three-in-one combination!" They both said in unison: "We must not fall for this trick!" Immediately, they mobilized the masses to follow the clues and firmly grasp class struggle, finally smashing the class enemy's plot.

"To prevent the older generation from becoming alienated from the masses, and to enable the younger generation to be tempered." Our great leader Chairman Mao's affectionate instructions vividly embody Chairman Mao's boundless concern for revolutionary old cadres and boundless expectations for young new cadres.

Revolutionary old cadres and young new cadres at all levels of the Revolutionary Committees should firmly remember Chairman Mao's great instructions and strive in this direction.

Revolutionary old cadres and young new cadres each have their own advantages and strengths. Both sides should, in the fiery class struggle and in the practice of seizing revolution and promoting production, "respect each other, learn from each other, complement each other's strengths and weaknesses, so as to unite as one and carry out a common cause."

In the course of work, new and old revolutionary cadres may have differences and contradictions. What should be done? "We advocate active ideological struggle," opposing the maintenance of a harmonious atmosphere without principles. The only criterion for eliminating differences and resolving contradictions is to arm our minds with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. As long as everyone acts according to Mao Zedong Thought and unifies thought and will with Mao Zedong Thought, the new and old cadres in the Revolutionary Committees can unite as one, together with the broad revolutionary masses, firmly grasp the revolution, vigorously promote production, and make new contributions to the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

### 新老干部“一对红”

    新老干部“一对红”
    夜深了，山东省威海市郊凤林公社革命委员会的办公室里还亮着灯。革委会主任蔡念田和革命群众代表、革委会常委宋文秀，正在聚精会神地学习毛主席的最新指示，互相交谈心得体会。人们都称他们是新老“一对红”。
    在革委会刚成立、小宋担任常委时，老蔡有点看不起这个“黄毛丫头”。小宋呢，心想：老蔡是公社旧党委副书记，执行过资产阶级反动路线，自己过去造过他的反，现在又跟他在一块工作，恐怕搞不好关系。就这样，两个人到了一块老是别别扭扭的。
    毛主席说：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”他们带着自己的问题，在学习班里反复斗私批修，一遍又一遍地学习了毛主席的教导：“我们党如果没有广大的新干部同老干部一致合作，我们的事业就会中断。”“新老干部应该是彼此尊重，互相学习，取长补短，以便团结一致，进行共同的事业，而防止宗派主义的倾向。”学习中，老蔡回忆了旧社会祖孙三代讨饭的苦难家史。他刚住口，热泪满面的小宋就痛心地说：“过去咱们都是一根藤上的苦瓜，是资产阶级反动路线把咱们分了家，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线救了咱们。今天，毛主席又把‘权’交给咱们来掌。可是我……”没容小宋讲完，老蔡又接过话头说：“咱们心连不到一块儿，这是让‘私’字迷了心窍。不彻底斗倒私心，就不能掌好权用好权，就是对毛主席的不忠。”接着，他主动地检查了自己不相信群众的错误。小宋也检查了自己过去看老干部的错误和缺点多，对老干部的长处和优点看得少。两人越谈越亲近，越谈越知心，于是就自愿地结成了互帮互学的对子。从此以后，他俩发现了对方的优点就及时虚心学习，发现缺点就大胆批评、热情帮助。
    小宋在工作中积极肯干，敢冲敢闯，但接受群众的意见不够虚心，把自己当成革命动力的时候多，当作革命对象的时候少。老蔡发现这个问题以后，就主动找她谈心，告诉她，自己过去犯错误的主要原因之一，就是只要求群众服从自己，不愿向群众学习，天长日久就脱离了群众。他勉励小宋要坚决听毛主席的话，正确对待自己，正确对待群众，不但革别人的命，也要革自己的命，永远做群众的小学生。
    老蔡在工作中稳扎稳打，埋头苦干，但因怕再犯错误，所以有些缩手缩脚。小宋见到以后，主动和老蔡一起斗私批修，帮助他把“怕”字换成“敢”字，使老蔡增强了信心，提高了勇气，在工作中更加认真负责，大胆发挥自己的长处。
    就在这时候，躲在阴暗角落里的坏人爬出来放了一股臭风，说什么“革委会主任一切得听黄毛丫头摆布”。老蔡听到以后，就找小宋一起谈心，他说：“小宋，你对这样的话有啥想法？”小宋斩钉截铁地说：“这是阶级敌人挑拨新老干部的团结，企图破坏革命三结合的阴谋！”他俩不约而同地说：“我们决不能上当！”于是，他们马上发动群众顺藤找瓜，狠抓阶级斗争，终于粉碎了阶级敌人的阴谋。
              红柱石
   “使前辈人不脱离群众，使青年人得到锻炼。”我们伟大领袖毛主席的这一亲切教导，生动地体现了毛主席对革命老干部的无限关怀，对年青新干部的无限期望。
    各级革命委员会中的革命老干部和年青的新干部，都应当牢记毛主席的这一伟大教导，朝着这个方向去努力。
    革命的老干部、年青的新干部，各有各的优点，各有各的长处。双方应当在火热的阶级斗争中，在抓革命促生产的实践中，“彼此尊重，互相学习，取长补短，以便团结一致，进行共同的事业”。
    新老革命干部在工作当中，可能会发生分歧，产生矛盾。怎么办？“我们主张积极的思想斗争”，反对无原则地保持一团和气。消除分歧，解决矛盾的唯一准则，就是用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑。只要大家都按照毛泽东思想办事，用毛泽东思想来统一思想统一意志，革命委员会中的新老干部就能团结一致，和广大革命群众
  一起，狠抓革命，猛促生产，为夺取文化大革命的全面胜利做出新的贡献。
