West Germany is accelerating its economic expansion into Asia, Africa, and Latin America as the political and economic crises within the imperialist camp deepen. German monopolistic capital, seeking to shift the burden of the crisis and secure new investment and commodity markets, is intensifying its economic penetration into these regions.

According to statistics from the West German government's Economic Cooperation Department, German monopolistic capital's current investments in Asia, Africa, and Latin America account for 40% of its total foreign investments, up from 30% in 1966. By the end of last year, German investments in Latin America had reached 2 billion marks, making it the leading region. In Africa, investments have increased from approximately 420 million marks in 1965 to 523 million marks currently. In Asia, investments have risen from 280 million marks to 470 million marks.

    西德加紧向亚非拉地区进行经济扩张
    随着帝国主义阵营的政治、经济危机的日益加深，西德垄断资本为转嫁危机，争夺新的投资和商品市场，正加紧向亚非拉地区进行经济扩张。
    据西德政府经济合作部统计，西德垄断资本目前在亚非拉地区的投资占其对外总投资的百分之四十，而在一九六六年还只占百分之三十。去年底，西德垄断资本在拉美的投资达二十亿马克，占首位；在非洲的投资已从一九六五年的约四亿二千万马克增加到现在的五亿二千三百万马克；在亚洲，也由二亿八千万马克增至目前的四亿七千多万马克。
