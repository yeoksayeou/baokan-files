The Maozhuang Production Brigade in Xugeng County, Hebei Province, under the guidance of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, has launched a deep and sustained revolutionary criticism from the perspective of the major issues between the two lines, linking it with the actual class struggle in the village. Through this revolutionary criticism, Mao Zedong Thought has been widely promoted, significantly raising the class struggle and line struggle consciousness of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres, promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking, and further consolidating the proletariat's dominance in the ideological sphere.

Starting the Revolutionary Criticism from the Major Issues Between the Two Lines

At the beginning, some poor and lower-middle peasants did not fully understand the great significance of the revolutionary criticism and did not pay enough attention to it. Some elderly people thought that since they were illiterate, they couldn't write or speak, so they couldn't participate in the criticism. Some people criticized for a while and then felt that it was enough, thinking there was nothing more to criticize. A few cadres were afraid of "inviting trouble" and didn't dare to lead the criticism boldly.

In response to these thoughts, the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team first helped the brigade organize various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They organized cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants to seriously study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and articles from the editorial departments of the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily, such as "The Struggle Between the Two Lines in the Chinese Countryside." They also mobilized the poor and lower-middle peasants to engage in activities recalling past hardships and current sweetness. The poor and lower-middle peasants in Maozhuang Brigade suffered greatly under the exploitation and oppression of the landlord class in the old society. Every family had a bitter account, and everyone had a sad history. Recalling the hardships of the old society, they hated the Chinese Khrushchev even more. Poor peasant old woman Fan Xiaoxin, for example, had to beg for eight years as a child, and later was sold from Xindian County to Xugeng County. Her husband worked as a long-term laborer for the landlord, living a life worse than cattle. Once, her husband threw a piece of bread over the wall to her, and when the landlord found out, he beat them both half to death. Even now, she still has scars all over her body. Fan Xiaoxin recalled this painful history and said with great hatred, "The Chinese Khrushchev says that 'exploitation is a merit.' This is completely speaking for the landlords and rich peasants. He wants us to go back to the old road and suffer again. We will never agree to this, not in a thousand or ten thousand ways! We must thoroughly criticize and expose him."

Through study, discussion, and recalling the past, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants strengthened their class struggle consciousness and realized that although the Chinese Khrushchev had been overthrown, his poisonous influence was still widespread and deep. If his poisonous influence was not thoroughly criticized and eliminated in terms of politics, ideology, and theory, it would be impossible to further consolidate the proletariat's dominance in the ideological sphere, and there would be a danger of capitalist restoration. Revolutionary criticism is a major issue concerning which road to take, a major issue of thoroughly criticizing and exposing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and a major direction of the current struggle. From then on, the poor and lower-middle peasants in this brigade took revolutionary criticism as the most important battle task at the moment, from the brigade to the family, from the streets to the fields, everywhere they set up battlefields for revolutionary criticism.

Linking the Revolutionary Criticism with the Village's Class Struggle

Chairman Mao recently taught us, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution in the socialist conditions, a revolution by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and its led broad revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." The poor and lower-middle peasants in Maozhuang Brigade, after studying this latest instruction from Chairman Mao, gained boundless fighting strength. They linked the criticism with the class struggle in their own village, fighting against the untransformed landlord elements and the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries in the village, and implementing the dictatorship of the masses over them. They also, in combination with the reality of class struggle, thoroughly criticized the Chinese Khrushchev's theory of "the extinction of class struggle."

Everyone also exposed what poisons the Chinese Khrushchev had spread over the past eighteen years and how the class struggle in the village manifested. Then, based on Chairman Mao's teachings, they criticized and exposed each of the Chinese Khrushchev's fallacies one by one. Before the cooperative movement, the Chinese Khrushchev vigorously advocated the development of the rich peasant economy, causing polarization in the countryside. Poor peasant Liu Meilan, for example, received twelve mu of land during the land reform, but due to lack of livestock and labor, and her husband's illness, she had to sell it all in less than three years. During the criticism meeting, she said, "The Chinese Khrushchev shouted loudly about developing the rich peasant economy, but in reality, he wanted us to return to the old road of the pre-liberation era, to suffer the oppression and exploitation of the landlords and rich peasants again." During the cooperative movement, the poor and lower-middle peasants in Maozhuang Brigade, following Chairman Mao's teachings, organized a joint village cooperative, but it was immediately abolished by the Chinese Khrushchev's agent in the Shijiazhuang region. Later, the Chinese Khrushchev launched the "three autonomies and one contract" black wind. Recalling these class struggles, the poor and lower-middle peasants in Maozhuang realized more clearly that the Chinese Khrushchev was the chief culprit who strangled the agricultural cooperative movement and attempted to restore capitalism in the countryside. Everyone, with Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, thoroughly criticized the Chinese Khrushchev's various fallacies.

This method of linking the village's class struggle reality, recalling, comparing, and criticizing period by period, made the poor and lower-middle peasants see clearly, touch concretely, criticize thoroughly, and feel deeply. They hated the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the party who attempted to restore capitalism even more, and they were more determined to take the socialist road.

Using the Revolutionary Criticism as a Motive Force to Promote Various Tasks

The poor and lower-middle peasants in Maozhuang Brigade closely linked the revolutionary criticism with the current tasks, effectively promoting the completion of various tasks. During the grain distribution, they deeply criticized the Chinese Khrushchev's fallacies of "material incentive" and "getting rich," establishing collective thinking and overcoming the practice of distributing more and retaining less. During the formulation of the spring planting plan, they thoroughly criticized the Chinese Khrushchev's advocacy of "economic freedom" and "money as the commander," establishing the thought of serving the people and farming for the revolution, overcoming the previous practice of "planting whatever brings in more money." Some brigade and production team cadres, after being impacted by the masses during the movement, felt wronged, resentful, and discouraged, and did not dare to come forward and lead the revolution. The propaganda team organized the cadres to deeply study Chairman Mao's policies for cadres, while criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large area and protecting a small clique." The revolutionary cadres understood Chairman Mao's policies for cadres more deeply. They directed all their hatred towards the Chinese Khrushchev, dispelled the "three airs" (wronged, resentful, and discouraged), and boldly shouldered the responsibilities of revolution and production. The team leader of the seventh production team, Shen Fenfu, said, "In the past, I made mistakes in my work and implemented the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. The poor and lower-middle peasants criticizing me was completely justified. The one who harmed me was the Chinese Khrushchev. I should hate the Chinese Khrushchev. The proletarian dictatorship is hard-won. If we poor and lower-middle peasants do not hold power, who will? If I drop my responsibilities and do not work, I will fall into the Chinese Khrushchev's trap, which is disloyal to Chairman Mao." He immediately checked his mistakes with the poor and lower-middle peasants and actively led the revolution and production.

Linking the Struggle Against Selfishness with the Criticism of Revisionism

The Maozhuang Brigade linked the process of revolutionary criticism with the process of transforming worldviews, closely combining the struggle against selfishness with the criticism of revisionism. With the help of the propaganda team, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants carried out recalling and investigating activities, that is, recalling what poisons the Chinese Khrushchev spread in each period and investigating what they thought at that time. They learned one of Chairman Mao's viewpoints, criticized one of the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist fallacies, uprooted one bit of selfishness, and elevated the struggle against selfishness to the level of the struggle between the two lines. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants said, "Selfishness is the root of revisionism. With selfishness, one will become revisionist. Without struggling against selfishness, it is impossible to eliminate the poison of the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionism." They voluntarily exposed and struggled against their selfishness in the criticism of revisionism. During the criticism of "three autonomies and one contract," poor peasant Shen Fugui checked his own selfishness, admitting that he was poisoned by the Chinese Khrushchev and ran a small business at the market. He said, "At that time, the more I ran, the lazier I became, the more I ran, the greedier I became. If I continued like this, I would become revisionist." Some members checked themselves, saying, "A few years ago, we did not see through the reactionary nature of 'three autonomies and one contract' because we had the 'self' character, and we did not walk the right path but the wrong path." During the criticism of "material incentive" and "work points as the commander," the mother of poor peasant Wang Qutang checked herself for only thinking about earning more work points, resulting in listening to the landlord elements and having her son pull soil to fertilize the land instead of working hard. She said at the struggle against selfishness and criticism of revisionism meeting, "With selfishness, one cannot distinguish between enemies and friends, harming oneself and the country." Many members checked themselves for working for work points in the past, saying, "Emphasizing work points, exerting effort for 'self,' harms the collective; emphasizing proletarian politics, exerting effort for 'public,' works hard and solidly for the revolution."

Through the struggle against selfishness and criticism of revisionism, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants raised their line struggle consciousness, established the thought of farming for the revolution. They immediately abolished the original reward system and work recording methods and began to implement the Dazhai-style work recording method.

    藁城县毛庄大队结合本村阶级斗争实际向中国赫鲁晓夫猛烈开火
    把革命大批判提到两条路线斗争高度
    革命的大批判促进了毛泽东思想大普及，进一步清除了反革命修正主义流毒，巩固了无产阶级在思想上的统治地位
    本报讯　河北省藁城县城关公社毛庄大队广大贫下中农和干部，在人民解放军某部毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，从两条路线的大是大非出发，联系本村阶级斗争实际，深入持久地开展革命大批判。通过革命大批判，毛泽东思想空前大普及，大大提高了广大贫下中农和干部的阶级斗争觉悟和路线斗争觉悟，促进了人的思想革命化，进一步巩固了无产阶级在思想上取得的统治地位。
    从两条路线的大是大非出发开展革命大批判
    开始，有些贫下中农对革命大批判的伟大意义认识不足，重视不够。有些老年人认为自己不识字，不能写，不会说，没法批。有的批了一阵之后，觉得差不多了，再批没啥批头了。个别干部怕“引火烧身”，批到自己头上，也不敢大胆领导。
    针对这些活思想，驻军毛泽东思想宣传队首先帮助大队举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，组织干部和贫下中农，认真学习毛主席的最新指示及《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》编辑部的文章《中国农村两条道路的斗争》，发动贫下中农开展忆苦思甜活动。毛庄大队的贫下中农在旧社会受尽地主阶级的剥削和压迫，家家有本血泪账，人人都有辛酸史。他们回忆起旧社会的苦难生活，更加痛恨中国赫鲁晓夫。贫农老大娘范小新，从小跟着父亲讨了八年饭，以后从新乐县被卖到藁城县，丈夫常年给地主扛长工，过着牛马不如的生活。有一次，她丈夫隔墙给她扔过一个饼子，地主发现后，便把他俩打得死去活来，至今身上还有条条伤疤。范小新老大娘回忆起这段苦难家史，无比愤恨地说：“中国赫鲁晓夫说什么‘剥削有功’，这完全是替地主、富农说话。他要我们走回头路，吃二遍苦，我们一千个不答应，一万个不答应！一定要把他彻底批深批透，斗倒斗臭。”
    经过学习讨论和回忆对比，广大贫下中农增强了阶级斗争观念，认识到：中国赫鲁晓夫虽然被拉下马，但是他的流毒还很广很深，如果不从政治上、思想上、理论上把他批深批透，彻底肃清他的流毒，就不能进一步巩固无产阶级在思想上的统治地位，就有复辟资本主义的危险。革命大批判是关系到走什么道路的大问题，是彻底批臭反革命修正主义路线，捍卫毛主席革命路线的大问题，是当前斗争的大方向。从此，这个大队的贫下中农把革命大批判当作当前最重要的战斗任务，从大队到家庭，从街头到地头，到处摆开了革命大批判的战场。
    把革命大批判和本村阶级斗争联系起来
    毛主席最近教导我们：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”毛庄大队贫下中农，学习了毛主席的这一最新指示，增添了无穷的战斗力量。他们把大批判和本村的阶级斗争联系起来，斗争了本村没有改造好的地主分子和国民党反动派的残渣余孽，并对他们实行了群众专政。他们又结合阶级斗争现实，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论。
    大家还揭发中国赫鲁晓夫十八年来放了哪些毒，本村阶级斗争有哪些表现；然后根据毛主席教导，把中国赫鲁晓夫所散布的谬论逐个批深、批透。合作化以前的一段时期，中国赫鲁晓夫大肆鼓吹发展富农经济，造成农村中的两极分化。贫农刘美兰土改时分了十二亩地，因缺牲口，少劳力，又赶上丈夫闹病，不到三年功夫又卖掉了。在批判会上，她说：“中国赫鲁晓夫大喊大叫要发展富农经济，实际上是叫我们又回到解放前的老路上去，重受地主富农的压迫和剥削。”在合作化运动中，毛庄大队贫下中农遵照毛主席的教导，组织起一个联村社，但是立即被中国赫鲁晓夫在石家庄地区的代理人砍掉了。以后中国赫鲁晓夫又刮起了“三自一包”的黑风。回忆这些阶级斗争实际，毛庄贫下中农更清楚地认识到：中国赫鲁晓夫是扼杀农业合作化运动和在农村搞资本主义复辟的罪魁祸首。大家以毛泽东思想为武器，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的种种谬论。
    这种联系本村的阶级斗争实际，一个时期一个时期的回忆、对比和批判，贫下中农看得见，摸得着，批得透，感受深刻，更加仇恨中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派复辟资本主义的罪行，更加坚定了走社会主义道路的决心。
    把革命大批判作为推动各项工作的动力
    毛庄大队贫下中农紧密结合当前各项任务开展革命大批判，有力地推动了各项任务的完成。在进行粮食分配时，他们就深入批判中国赫鲁晓夫“物质刺激”“发家致富”的谬论，树立集体主义思想，克服了多分少留的做法。在制定春季种植计划时，他们就狠批中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“经济自由”、“金钱挂帅”的黑货，树立为人民服务、为革命种田的思想，克服了从前“什么挣钱多就种什么”的做法。有些大队和生产队干部，在运动中受到群众的冲击，产生了冤气、怨气和泄气，不能勇敢站出来革命。宣传队就组织干部深入学习毛主席的干部政策，同时批判中国赫鲁晓夫“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线。革命干部对毛主席的干部政策理解更加深刻了，他们把千仇万恨集中到中国赫鲁晓夫身上，打消了“三气”，大胆地担起革命、生产重担。第七生产队队长申分另说：“我从前在工作中犯了错误，执行过中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，贫下中农批判我完全应该。害我的是中国赫鲁晓夫，恨要恨中国赫鲁晓夫。无产阶级的政权来之不易，我们贫下中农不掌权谁来掌权，我撂挑子不干，正好中了中国赫鲁晓夫的毒计，这是对毛主席的不忠。”他立即向贫下中农检查了错误，积极领导革命和生产。
    把斗私和批修紧密结合起来
    毛庄大队把革命大批判的过程作为改造世界观的过程，把斗私和批修紧密结合起来。在宣传队帮助下，广大贫下中农开展了忆、查活动，即：忆中国赫鲁晓夫在每个时期放的毒，查自己当时怎么想的。学习毛主席一个观点，批中国赫鲁晓夫一个修正主义谬论，挖掉一分私心，把斗私上升到两条路线斗争的高度。广大贫下中农说：“私是修根，有了私，就要变修。不斗私，就不能肃清中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义毒素。”他们在批修中自觉地亮私、斗私。在批判“三自一包”时，贫农申福礼检查自己私心作怪，中了中国赫鲁晓夫的毒，到集市上跑小买卖。说：“那时我越跑越懒，越跑越馋，如果这样下去就要变修。”有的社员检查说：“前几年，咱没有看透‘三自一包’的反动本质，就是因为有‘私’字，正道不走走歪道。”在批判“物质刺激”、“工分挂帅”时，贫农王秋堂的母亲检查自己光想挣大分，结果听了地主分子的话，叫儿子拉土积肥，不好好出勤。她在斗私批修讲用会上说：“有了私心，就会敌我不分，害了自己，害了国家。”不少社员检查自己过去干活为工分时说：“突出工分，有劲往‘私’字上使，损害集体；突出无产阶级政治，有劲往‘公’字上使，干活扎扎实实为革命。”
    经过斗私批修，广大贫下中农提高了路线斗争觉悟，树立了为革命种田的思想。他们立即废除了原来的奖励制度和记工方法，开始实行大寨式的记工方法。
