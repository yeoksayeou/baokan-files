Revolutionary criticism is a sharp weapon for the proletariat to thoroughly defeat the bourgeoisie and all other exploiting classes under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship. It is a strategic measure to ensure that our party and state will never change color. Chairman Mao repeatedly instructs us: Never forget class struggle. To grasp class struggle, the most fundamental task is to conduct revolutionary criticism and to carry it out deeply and persistently.

Under socialist conditions, "class struggle has not ended. The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between various political forces, the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm, will be long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very intense." Revolutionary criticism, as a sharp weapon for class struggle under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, should be carried out throughout the entire Cultural Revolution.

The prerequisite for revolutionary criticism is to study. Experience tells us that to conduct revolutionary criticism well, we must earnestly study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. Only then can we firmly grasp the major issues of the struggle between the two lines and strike at the heart of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pursued by the handful of capitalists within the party. Great Mao Zedong Thought is a political microscope and telescope, a powerful and sharp weapon for thoroughly defeating all kinds of class enemies. Insisting on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works with the problems of the struggle between the two lines in mind, especially studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought on the theory, line, principles, policies, and a series of latest instructions of the proletarian dictatorship, is the fundamental guarantee for conducting revolutionary criticism well.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism, is revolution. Destruction must be reasoned, and reasoning is construction. Destruction comes first, and construction is within it." To carry out revolutionary criticism, we should start from implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, through revolutionary criticism, to remove obstacles and resistance for thoroughly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, for fully implementing Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and to pave the way for the complete victory of the Cultural Revolution. This is the key to whether revolutionary criticism can be carried out deeply and persistently and whether it can fully exert its revolutionary power.

Great Mao Zedong Thought is the truth of proletarian revolution. The process of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions is inevitably a sharp and complex struggle, a process of criticizing the handful of capitalists within the party and their counter-revolutionary revisionist line and reactionary bourgeois worldview. Chairman Mao's latest instructions can only be fully implemented in the struggle, in the revolutionary criticism.

To carry out revolutionary criticism for fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions in the revolutionary criticism: this is the revolutionary dialectic of "without destruction, there can be no construction" and "destruction comes first, construction is within it" that Chairman Mao often teaches us. Firmly grasping this revolutionary dialectic, we can most powerfully strike at the enemies of the proletariat politically, ideologically, and theoretically, remove interference, clear the way for fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and push the Cultural Revolution forward in big strides along the revolutionary path opened by Chairman Mao.

Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry out revolutionary criticism deeply and persistently, further fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, advance in big strides along the revolutionary course opened by Chairman Mao, and achieve the complete victory of the Cultural Revolution!

### 用毛泽东思想统帅革命大批判

    用毛泽东思想统帅革命大批判
    革命大批判，是在无产阶级专政条件下，无产阶级彻底战胜资产阶级和其他一切剥削阶级的锐利武器，是保证我们的党和国家永远不改变颜色的战略措施。毛主席谆谆教导我们：千万不要忘记阶级斗争。抓阶级斗争，最根本的就是要抓革命大批判，把革命大批判深入持久地开展下去。
    在社会主义条件下，“阶级斗争并没有结束。无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，各派政治力量之间的阶级斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。”革命大批判，作为无产阶级专政条件下进行阶级斗争的锐利武器，应该贯穿于无产阶级文化大革命的始终。
    革命大批判的大前提，是大学习。经验告诉我们，要搞好革命大批判，就要认真地活学活用毛泽东思想，才能牢牢抓住两条路线斗争的大是大非问题，击中党内一小撮最大的走资派及其推行的反革命修正主义路线的要害。伟大的毛泽东思想，是政治上的显微镜和望远镜，是彻底战胜形形色色的阶级敌人的最强大、最锐利的武器。坚持带着两条路线斗争中的问题，活学活用毛主席著作，特别是学好用好毛主席关于无产阶级专政条件下的理论、路线、方针、政策和一系列最新指示，是搞好革命大批判的根本保证。
    毛主席教导我们：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。”开展革命大批判，应该从落实毛主席最新指示出发，通过革命大批判，为大立毛泽东思想，为全面落实毛主席最新指示排除障碍和阻力，为全面实现毛主席的伟大战略部署，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利铺平道路。这是革命大批判能不能持久、深入开展下去，能不能充分发挥革命威力的关键。
    伟大的毛泽东思想，是无产阶级革命的真理。落实毛主席最新指示的过程，不可避免的是一个尖锐复杂的斗争过程，是批判党内一小撮走资派，以及他们的反革命修正主义路线和反动的资产阶级世界观的过程。毛主席最新指示，只有在斗争中，在革命大批判中才能全面落实。
    为全面落实毛主席的最新指示开展革命大批判，在革命大批判中全面落实毛主席最新指示：这就是毛主席经常教导我们的“不破不立”，“破字当头，立在其中”的革命辩证法。牢牢掌握这个革命辩证法，就能从政治上、思想上、理论上最有力地打击无产阶级的敌人，为全面落实毛主席最新指示排除干扰、扫清道路，推动无产阶级文化大革命沿着毛主席的革命轨道大踏步前进。
    让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，深入持久地开展革命大批判，进一步全面落实毛主席的最新指示，沿着毛主席开辟的革命航道大踏步前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
