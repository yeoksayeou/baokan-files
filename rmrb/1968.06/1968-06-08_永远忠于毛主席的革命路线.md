	Forever Loyal to Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line
	Yang Baohua, Chairman of the Qingdao Revolutionary Committee

	In the midst of the triumphant songs of victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our era has produced another great communist warrior, comrade Men He, who shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. He has set a shining example of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. By repeatedly studying comrade Men He's heroic deeds and reflecting on my own journey during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I deeply feel that comrade Men He could dedicate his life to guarding, standing watch, and fighting for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line because he was consciously and thoroughly loyal to Chairman Mao.

	Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, we proletarian revolutionaries in Qingdao seized power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and established the Qingdao Revolutionary Committee last year. After the victory of seizing power, the first issue I encountered was the question of for whom to seize power. I once thought, as an ordinary young worker, how could I wield the power of a city with a population of a million? As soon as this thought arose, I immediately recalled Chairman Mao's great teachings: "Communist Party members should not vie for personal military power (they must not vie for it, and they must never learn from Zhang Guotao), but they should vie for the Party's military power, for the people's military power." Chairman Mao's teachings had a profound impact on my mind. I thought: Yes! The power we proletarian revolutionaries have fought hard to seize, if we do not hold it, who will? I then carefully studied the teachings of Vice Chairman Lin Biao: "With political power, the proletariat and the working people have everything. Without political power, they lose everything." We seize power not for personal gain, but for the proletariat, to guard, stand watch, and fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. A person's abilities may vary, but as long as one is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and his revolutionary line, follows Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and believes in and relies on the broad revolutionary masses, one can achieve victory in all endeavors. Over the past year since the establishment of the Qingdao Revolutionary Committee, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we have consolidated and developed the revolutionary great alliance, won over allies, deeply and persistently carried out the revolutionary great criticism, and launched continuous and fierce attacks on the class enemy, smashing the class enemy's evil plots to shake and overthrow the newly established revolutionary committee. This has made the revolutionary committee a strong command center leading the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses in the struggle against the class enemy. In the course of the struggle, I deeply felt that forgetting class struggle and line struggle is the greatest disloyalty to Chairman Mao.

	Over the past two years, under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought and in the great storms of class struggle, I have been tempered and improved. However, compared to comrade Men He, I still have a long way to go. In the future, I will definitely take comrade Men He as my shining example, always thinking of Chairman Mao, always obeying Chairman Mao, always following Chairman Mao, and always fighting for Chairman Mao. I will strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, criticize and repudiate revisionism, and in the process of transforming the objective world, transform the subjective world, promoting my own ideological revolutionization. I will continuously raise my awareness of class struggle and line struggle, and regard defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line as my sacred duty, guarding, standing watch, and fighting for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line for life!

    永远忠于毛主席的革命路线
    青岛市革命委员会主任　杨保华
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，我们时代的又一个闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的伟大的共产主义战士——门合同志，为我们树立了一个无限忠于毛主席革命路线的光辉榜样。反复学习门合同志的英雄事迹，回顾自己在无产阶级文化大革命运动中走过的道路，我深深体会到：门合同志之所以能一辈子为毛主席的革命路线放好哨，站好岗，打好仗，就是因为他对毛主席自觉地忠，彻底地忠。　
  在毛主席的革命路线指引下，在人民解放军的大力支持下，我们青岛无产阶级革命派去年夺了党内一小撮走资派的权，建立了青岛市革命委员会。夺权胜利以后，随着地位的变化，我首先遇到的一个问题，是为谁掌权的问题。我曾一度想过，自己是个普通的青年工人，那能掌得了这个百万人口城市的大权？这种想法一产生，我立即想起了毛主席的伟大教导：“共产党员不争个人的兵权（决不能争，再也不要学张国焘），但要争党的兵权，要争人民的兵权。”毛主席的这一教导，在我思想上引起了极大的震动。我想：是啊！我们无产阶级革命派经过英勇奋战夺来的权，我们不掌谁掌？我又认真学习了林彪副主席的教导：“有了政权，无产阶级，劳动人民，就有了一切。没有政权，就丧失一切。”我们掌权，不是为个人掌权，而是为无产阶级掌权，为毛主席革命路线放好哨，站好岗，打好仗。一个人能力有大小，但只要无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，相信和依靠广大革命群众，就能无往而不胜。青岛市革命委员会建立一年多来，在毛主席一系列最新指示指引下，巩固和发展了革命的大联合，争取了同盟军，深入持久地开展革命的大批判，不停顿地向阶级敌人发起猛烈进攻，粉碎了阶级敌人妄图动摇和颠覆新生的革命委员会的罪恶阴谋，使革命委员会成为带领无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众对阶级敌人进行战斗的坚强指挥部。在斗争的实践中，我深深体会到：忘记了阶级斗争和路线斗争，就是对毛主席最大的不忠。
    两年来，在毛泽东思想哺育下，在阶级斗争的大风大浪里，我得到了锻炼和提高，但是与门合同志相比，还差得很远很远。今后，我一定要以门合同志为光辉榜样，一切想着毛主席，一切服从毛主席，一切紧跟毛主席，一切为着毛主席。要努力活学活用毛主席著作，斗私批修，在改造客观世界的同时，改造主观世界，促进自己的思想革命化。要不断地提高阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，把捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，作为自己的神圣职责，一辈子为毛主席的革命路线放好哨，站好岗，打好仗！
