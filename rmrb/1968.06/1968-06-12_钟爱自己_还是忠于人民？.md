Mao Zedong Thought Nurtures Heroes. In the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, another hero armed with Mao Zedong Thought, Comrade Menhe, a good cadre of Chairman Mao, has emerged in our ranks. Comrade Menhe's heroic deed of sacrificing himself to save twenty-seven class brothers has set a shining example of being loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Comrade Menhe lived to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and died to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. His noble actions are a manifestation of his firm establishment of a proletarian worldview. Comrade Menhe's heroic deeds have shattered the survival philosophy of the Chinese Khrushchev.

The Chinese Khrushchev, starting from counter-revolutionary extreme individualism, shamelessly advocates: "Love oneself, protect one's own life and health." This is the most shameless and barefaced bourgeois survival philosophy.

"Loving oneself" or loving the people and being loyal to the people, these are two fundamentally opposed worldviews. A person who "loves himself" throws the interests of the Party and the people to the winds, always puts personal interests first, and in normal times will embezzle public funds for private gain; in times of severe struggle, will desert; and in life-and-death situations, will betray the revolution and become a despicable traitor. The Chinese Khrushchev, the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, is a despicable traitor who has knelt down multiple times before the imperialists and the reactionary Kuomintang. Not only that, but he also directs some people to surrender to the enemy and betray the revolution. The Chinese Khrushchev's survival philosophy is a pure traitor's philosophy. We must thoroughly criticize and expose it.

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation." To become a steadfast proletarian revolutionary, we must take Comrade Menhe as our example, elevate the struggle to criticize selfishness and establish public-mindedness to the level of the struggle between the two lines. We must, like Comrade Menhe, study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly transform our worldview, be infinitely loyal to the people, infinitely loyal to the Party, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and become a people's soldier who "never seeks personal gain and always seeks the benefit of others." We must always stand guard for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, fight the good fight, and contribute all our strength for the interests of the Party and the people.

    “钟爱自己”还是忠于人民？
    某部战士　姜桂祥　谷永昌
    毛泽东思想育英雄。在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，又一个用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄，毛主席的好干部门合同志，出现在我们队伍之中。门合同志舍身抢救二十七个阶级兄弟的英雄事迹，为我们树立了一个一贯忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席革命路线的光辉榜样。
    门合同志生为捍卫毛主席的革命路线而战斗，死为捍卫毛主席的革命路线而献身的崇高行为，是他牢固地树立了无产阶级世界观的表现。门合同志的光辉事迹，粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫的活命哲学。
    中国赫鲁晓夫从反革命的极端利己主义出发，胡说什么：“钟爱自己，保护自己的生命与健康”。这是最无耻的、赤裸裸的资产阶级活命哲学。
    “钟爱”自己还是热爱人民、忠于人民，这是两种根本对立的世界观。一个“钟爱”自己的人，把党和人民的利益抛在九霄云外，处处私字挂帅，在平时就会损公肥私；在斗争的严重时刻，就会当逃兵；在生死关头，就会叛变革命，成为可耻的叛徒。中国赫鲁晓夫，这个党内最大的走资派，就是多次跪倒在帝国主义和国民党反动派脚下的可耻叛徒。不但如此，他还指使一些人向敌人屈膝投降，叛变革命。中国赫鲁晓夫的活命哲学，就是道道地地的叛徒哲学。我们必须把它批深批透，批倒批臭。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。为了成为一个坚强的无产阶级革命者，我们要以门合同志为榜样，把破私立公的斗争，提到两条路线斗争的高度。要象门合同志那样，活学活用毛泽东思想，彻底改造自己的世界观，无限忠于人民，无限忠于党，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，做一个“毫不利己专门利人”的人民战士。我们要时时刻刻为毛主席的革命路线放好哨，站好岗，打好仗，为党和人民的利益，贡献出自己的一切力量。
