	Rome, June 8 (New China News Agency) — Progressive students in Milan, a major industrial city in northern Italy, held a meeting and demonstration on the evening of June 7 to protest against the despicable slander by Italian bourgeois newspapers against the progressive student movement in Italy. The students also fought all night with reactionary police who came to suppress them using sticks and stones.

	After the protest meeting, the demonstrators marched towards the printing plant of the *Corriere della Sera*, which represents the interests of the big bourgeoisie in northern Italy, to hold a demonstration. They held up banners with slogans such as "Power to the workers!" and other militant calls. Some students bravely lay down in front of trucks carrying the *Corriere della Sera*, preventing these newspapers that slander the progressive student movement in Italy from being delivered to various places. The police savagely beat the demonstrating students. The students overturned dozens of trucks to use as barricades and bravely fought back with sticks, stones, and glass bottles. The emotionally charged students also smashed the glass windows of nearby big bourgeois shops and buildings. The windows of the Fiat car factory building were also smashed to pieces.

	The police carried out a frenzied suppression of the demonstrators, with over 200 students arrested.
