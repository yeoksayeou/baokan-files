The reporter from *Qinghai Daily* commented on "Revolutionary Criticism Is Great" using vivid facts to reflect the brilliant achievements of the revolutionary criticism in the Xining region of Qinghai Province. This proves that revolutionary criticism has shown and is continuing to show tremendous power, and it emphasizes the importance of vigorously carrying out revolutionary criticism.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its led revolutionary masses and the Kuomintang reactionaries. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." To carry this unprecedented political revolution to the end, we must not only expose the handful of traitors, spies, diehard capitalist-roaders, and other counter-revolutionaries hidden within the revolutionary ranks and overthrow them organizationally, but we must also thoroughly criticize their heinous crimes of opposing the Party, opposing socialism, and opposing Mao Zedong Thought. We must criticize their reactionary bourgeois worldviews, exposing their political, ideological, and theoretical crimes to the light of day. This is a long-term and strategic task for consolidating the proletarian dictatorship in our country and preventing capitalist restoration. It is an important part of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, the major direction of the revolutionary struggle, and an important strategic measure for us to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

At present, hundreds of millions of military and civilian personnel across the country are advancing along Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Revolutionary criticism is being carried out vigorously. We can see that under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, revolutionary criticism has powerfully destroyed the social basis for Khrushchev's restoration of capitalism in China, promoting the in-depth development of our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and fundamentally changing people's spiritual outlook. The development of revolutionary criticism is making Mao Zedong Thought more widely known, making Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line deeply rooted in people's hearts; the development of revolutionary criticism is consolidating the proletarian dictatorship in our country; the development of revolutionary criticism is consolidating the newly established revolutionary committees; the development of revolutionary criticism is powerfully striking down right opportunism, right splitism, and right capitulationism, smashing the rightist reversal wind. Many facts show that in units where revolutionary criticism is consistently and vigorously carried out, and the struggle is directed against a handful of class enemies and the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, factionalism, sectarianism, anarchism, and other tendencies have no market. Revolutionary unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination can be quickly realized and consolidated, and the combination of revolution and production can be well carried out. The experience in the Xining region is like this, and the experience in other regions across the country is also like this.

Let us hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism guided by Mao Zedong Thought, and without relaxation, carry out revolutionary criticism persistently and deeply. Let us combine revolutionary criticism with the cleansing of class ranks, combine revolutionary criticism with the rectification of Party organizations, and combine revolutionary criticism with the struggle, criticism, and transformation in our own units. Use revolutionary criticism to develop a good situation and welcome the more magnificent comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    革命大批判的巨大威力
    《青海日报》记者述评《革命的大批判好得很》，用生动的事实，集中地反映了青海省西宁地区革命大批判的辉煌战果，证明了革命大批判已经和正在显示出无比巨大的威力，证明了继续有力地开展革命的大批判是多么重要。
    毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”为了把这场史无前例的政治大革命进行到底，我们不但要把隐藏在革命队伍里的一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派和其他反革命分子揭露出来，从组织上把他们打倒，而且还必须彻底批判他们反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行，批判他们反动的资产阶级世界观，把他们从政治上、思想上、理论上批倒批臭，使他们反动的嘴脸和丑恶灵魂现形于光天化日之下。这是巩固我国无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟的百年大计、千年大计，是毛主席伟大战略部署的重要组成部分，是革命斗争的大方向，是我们当前夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的重要战略措施。
    目前，全国亿万军民正在沿着毛主席的伟大战略部署乘胜前进，革命大批判开展得轰轰烈烈。我们可以看到，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下的革命大批判，有力地摧毁了中国赫鲁晓夫在中国复辟资本主义的社会基础，推动着我国无产阶级文化大革命向纵深发展，从根本上改变着人们的精神面貌。革命大批判的开展，正在使毛泽东思想空前大普及，使毛主席的无产阶级革命路线更加深入人心；革命大批判的开展，正在巩固我国无产阶级专政；革命大批判的开展，正在巩固新生的革命委员会；革命大批判的开展，正在有力地打击右倾机会主义，右倾分裂主义，右倾投降主义，粉碎右倾翻案妖风。许多事实说明：哪个单位始终不懈地抓紧了革命大批判，斗争矛头始终对准一小撮阶级敌人和反革命修正主义路线，哪个单位的山头主义、宗派主义、无政府主义等就没有市场，革命大联合和革命“三结合”就能得到迅速实现和发展巩固，抓革命、促生产就搞得好。西宁地区的经验是这样，全国其他地区的经验也是这样。
    让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想的革命批判的旗帜，毫不松懈地把革命大批判持久深入地开展下去，把革命的大批判和清理阶级队伍结合起来，把革命的大批判和整顿党的组织结合起来，把革命的大批判和本单位斗批改结合起来。用革命的大批判发展大好形势，用革命的大批判迎接无产阶级文化大革命更加伟大的全面胜利。
