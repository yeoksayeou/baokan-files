Medical officer Gong Puceng of a certain unit of the Second Artillery has long adhered to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in his medical work. He has gone deep into the ranks, into the countryside, and into the mountains, with the spirit of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, serving the broad masses of cadres and soldiers, and serving the people. Everyone affectionately calls him the "White Crane of the Mountains."

Listen to Chairman Mao's words, go to the ranks, go to the countryside, and wholeheartedly serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

For whom should medical and health work serve? Should it serve the more than 500 million peasants and the broad masses of workers and peasants, or should it serve the few in the cities? This is a concentrated reflection of the fierce struggle between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev on the medical and health front. According to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, medical workers should go to the countryside, go deep into the grassroots, and wholeheartedly serve the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. The revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, on the other hand, advocates that medical workers stay in the cities, float on the surface, and serve the few in the cities, showing indifference and numbness to the sufferings of the broad masses, especially the more than 500 million peasants.

Gong Puceng, facing the fierce struggle between the two lines on the medical and health front, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," further realizing that the question of serving whom is a matter of stance, a matter of worldview. Whether or not to go deep into the ranks and grassroots is a major issue of whether or not to adhere to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and whether or not to be loyal to Chairman Mao. Gong Puceng, following Chairman Mao's teachings, has long been unconditionally going to the ranks and grassroots, wholeheartedly serving the troops and the people.

Every time Gong Puceng goes to the ranks, he stays in the most difficult places and does the hardest and dirtiest work. He thinks that since he is older than the cadres in the ranks and has more seniority, he is easily in a special position, so he often studies Chairman Mao's teachings: "All our cadres, regardless of their rank, are servants of the people," and consciously blends in with the cadres and soldiers in the ranks. He feels that the soldiers are great, rolling in the mud and soaking in the water day and night, with only one thought: following Chairman Mao to make revolution. Such good soldiers, such good class brothers, how can one not care for them and serve them! For the sake of his class brothers, Gong Puceng is willing to do anything.

To avoid soldiers being harmed by poisonous insects, plants, and trees when going up the mountain, he and a few comrades specially went up the mountain to collect poisonous specimens, helping the soldiers identify these poisons, although he was harmed himself, but he did not feel bitter. To solve the problem of soldiers not eating well and losing weight after intense labor in the summer, he went up the mountain to work with the soldiers, followed them to observe, and personally experienced, quickly finding the method of eating pickled vegetables to improve appetite, although he exerted great effort and sweated profusely, but he did not feel tired. To relieve the soldiers' pain, under the difficult condition of having few or no medicines, he tried every means to overcome all difficulties and quickly cured the soldiers' illnesses. Last April, the Third Battalion had cases of dysentery, and medicines were temporarily not available, so he tried every means to find local herbs. He heard villagers say that there was coptis on the mountain that could treat dysentery, and the next morning, he went up the mountain with a medical orderly. The mountain was full of dense forests and weeds, with no paths, and they crawled around, their clothes and skin torn, but they did not find any coptis after searching for half a day. In the afternoon, they encountered a marsh, and Gong Puceng accidentally fell in, half his body sinking into the muddy water. The medical orderly hurriedly pulled him, but also sank in. The two struggled out, covered in mud, and it was already five o'clock in the afternoon. But they did not give up, learning from Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our comrades should see achievements and see light in times of difficulty, and raise our courage." They encouraged each other, singing the song of Chairman Mao's quotations: "With determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory," and continued forward, finally finding a large patch of coptis in the depths of the forest. All the dysentery patients in the battalion were quickly cured.

Since liberation, the Chinese Khrushchev has been promoting a counter-revolutionary revisionist line on the medical and health front, inducing medical workers to pursue fame and wealth, not to study the prevention and treatment of common and prevalent diseases, and to be detached from reality and the masses. Gong Puceng, in his life and work with the broad masses of cadres and soldiers, deeply felt that common and prevalent diseases have the greatest impact and harm on the health of soldiers and the combat effectiveness of the troops. To serve the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, one must vigorously do a good job in the prevention and treatment of these diseases. For many years, Gong Puceng, with deep proletarian feelings, has focused his work on the ranks, on the grassroots, and on the prevention and treatment of common and prevalent diseases, using his practical actions to strongly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev on the medical and health front.

In the hot south, when the troops are camping, there are many flies in the toilets, easily spreading diseases and threatening the health of the troops and the masses. He was determined to solve this problem. Once, Gong Puceng went camping with the troops. Upon arriving at the camp, he personally helped the ranks dig toilets. After many experiments, he still could not reduce the breeding of flies. He was not discouraged and thought, thought, and suddenly remembered the characteristic that "mosquitoes fear light, flies fear darkness," and immediately discussed with the soldiers, digging two deep pits, both leaving only a small opening, but one covered with a canopy to keep the pit dark, and the other without a canopy, allowing some light to enter. The result was that the pit with the canopy did not breed maggots, while the pit without the canopy still bred maggots. Then, he further experimented, digging five dark pits, often observing the changes in the pits with a flashlight. When the local people came to clean the pits, he carefully observed. More than a month passed, and these few pits did not find a single maggot. He summarized the experience of "small opening, deep pit, dark inside, no maggots, fewer flies, less odor" for "camping toilets," which was quickly promoted in the local troops, greatly reducing the occurrence and spread of dysentery and other diseases. The soldiers happily said: "This time, the problem of wild camping sanitation and epidemic prevention has been solved."

Gong Puceng is like this, wholeheartedly serving the ranks and solving practical problems in a down-to-earth manner. He saw that some ranks placed vegetables on damp ground, easily causing them to rot and be wasted, so he braved the rain to go up the mountain to cut tree branches, set up vegetable racks, and place vegetables in layers to ensure that the soldiers get the necessary nutrition. He saw that the soldiers washed dishes in one basin, easily spreading diseases, so he consulted with local bricklayers and potters to make simple, economical, and practical flow-through dishwashers for the ranks. With the solution of one practical problem after another, the sanitation of the ranks improved rapidly, and common and prevalent diseases gradually decreased, effectively ensuring the progress of various tasks in the ranks.

Gong Puceng not only pays attention to preventing diseases that occur in general situations but also pays great attention to preventing common and prevalent diseases in different troops under different conditions. When he learned that the transport team had many cases of stomach and intestinal diseases, he went out with the drivers, loaded and unloaded cargo with them, ate with them, and rested with them. After more than half a month of experience and observation, he found that the drivers were mobile and scattered, their lives were irregular, and they had wide social contact, which were the main reasons for the occurrence of these diseases. He then conducted health and epidemic prevention education for the soldiers and suggested that the leadership take active measures, which played a good role in preventing the occurrence and spread of diseases.

Gong Puceng remembers Chairman Mao's great teachings: "Comrade White is selfless and dedicated to the people, which is reflected in his extreme responsibility for work and his extreme enthusiasm for comrades and the people." He is full of enthusiasm for cadres, soldiers, and the masses. The common and prevalent diseases among the masses in the camp, he also does his best to prevent and treat. Last March, he led a medical team to a construction team to do epidemic prevention work and found that dysentery was rampant in the village where the camp was located. Due to the counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev on the medical and health front, there was no medicine here, and the broad poor and lower-middle peasants had long been harmed by diseases. Gong Puceng and the medical team, with deep proletarian feelings for the masses and hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev, went door-to-door to treat patients and delivered medicine to their hands. After a period of treatment, most of the dysentery patients were cured. They also helped the villagers repair toilets, clean water sources, and train health workers. The spiritual outlook and sanitation of the entire village changed greatly, and the production attendance rate gradually increased. When they left, the villagers reluctantly said: "Chairman Mao sent his people to treat and prevent diseases for us poor and lower-middle peasants, and we will never forget Chairman Mao's kindness!"

With politics leading professional work, putting political and ideological work in the first place

Chairman Mao teaches us: Politics is the commander, the soul. Gong Puceng, in his epidemic prevention work, highlights proletarian politics and vigorously propagates Mao Zedong Thought. He says: "We change the objective world, first of all, we come into contact with people. If ideological work is done well, people will consciously change the objective world. Doing epidemic prevention work is also changing the objective world, and only by giving play to the role of people can it be done well." Therefore, every time he goes to a place, he first grasps political and ideological work and relies on the masses' awareness to consciously do things well.

Once, Gong Puceng led a medical team to a reservoir construction site and found that the Ninth Company had more patients. After investigation, it turned out that the leadership of this company did not pay enough attention to sanitation work. The medical team members were very anxious, and some suggested reporting this situation to the higher authorities for handling. But Gong Puceng thought: The medical team came to solve problems, and the problem has not been solved, which means the work has not been done well. He said to everyone: "To do a good job, you must first do a good job in ideological work. Relying solely on administrative orders cannot solve the problem." What to do? In the investigation, he learned that this company had a platoon where the epidemic prevention work was done well, and there had been no dysentery patients for three years. Gong Puceng and the medical team summarized the experience of this platoon in highlighting proletarian politics and doing a good job in epidemic prevention, and actively reported it to the company. This prompted the leadership of the Ninth Company, who specially convened a meeting of the branch committee to study epidemic prevention work. The canteen had two cooks who got dysentery and needed to be replaced, so Gong Puceng enthusiastically did ideological work with the cadres of the Ninth Company to replace the personnel, organizing the whole company to study the "Three Articles," using Zhang Zedong's "complete" and "thorough" revolutionary spirit and White's two "extremes" of noble character to educate the soldiers. The soldiers' ideological awareness was raised, and many comrades volunteered to work in the canteen, not only solving the problem of replacing personnel smoothly but also conducting a vivid education of Mao Zedong Thought among the masses. After this work, the epidemic prevention work in the Ninth Company was carried out.

Gong Puceng, in carrying out epidemic prevention work, always highlights proletarian politics and always achieves fruitful results. He deeply felt: "As long as you are good at using Mao Zedong Thought to propagate and arm the masses, there is no difficulty that cannot be overcome." Therefore, every time he goes to the ranks, he first goes to the canteen and the first thing he does is to study "In Memory of Norman Bethune" with the cooks, helping the cooks to take Zhang Zedong as an example and do a good job in the canteen; he talks with medical personnel, first studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune" together, educating medical personnel to be like White, extremely responsible for work and extremely enthusiastic for comrades and the people. He gives health classes to the company, first organizing the study of Chairman Mao's instructions on health work, speaking of the great leader Chairman Mao's concern for the liberation of mankind, and always caring for the health of every soldier, inspiring everyone's deep proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao. He believes that the army is for combat, and health classes should be to inspire morale and stimulate fighting spirit, so that soldiers can dare to fight with the enemy on the battlefield. Therefore, when giving health classes, he often says: "Life is precious, but if you do not serve the people well, it is meaningless. Heroes like Dong Cunrui and Huang Jiguang are evergreen." Every health class is profound and practical, touching and inspiring. Comrades feel warm in their hearts and say: "This is not only a health class but also a vivid class on studying Mao Zedong Thought."

Gong Puceng, in the process of going deep into the ranks, pays great attention to learning from the soldiers and striving to change his worldview. He deeply feels that the ranks are not only a vast field for me to serve the soldiers but also the best place for me to change my worldview. Going to the ranks once is attending a class on studying Mao Zedong Thought once, and the soldiers are the best teachers. The soldiers' lively practice of Chairman Mao's works is the best teaching material. If you just stay in the city, hide in the office, stay in the room, and stay in the books, you will never be able to change your worldview in your life.

    走毛主席指引的路　为工农兵服务
    ——记第二炮兵某部军医龚丕成同志
    第二炮兵某部军医龚丕成长期以来，在卫生工作中坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，深入连队，深入农村、山区，以“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的精神，为广大干部战士服务，为人民群众服务，大家亲热地称赞他是“山沟里的白求恩”。
    听毛主席的话，到连队去，到农村去，全心全意为工农兵服务
    医疗卫生工作应该为谁服务？为五亿多农民、为广大工农兵服务，还是为城市少数人服务？这是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线在医疗卫生战线上激烈斗争的集中反映。按照毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，医务工作者应该下到农村，深入基层，全心全意为广大工农兵服务。而中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线，则是主张医务工作者蹲在城市，浮在上层，为城市少数人服务，对广大群众特别是五亿多农民的疾苦，漠不关心，麻木不仁。
    龚丕成面对着医疗卫生战线上两条路线的激烈斗争，反复学习了毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，进一步认识到：为谁服务的问题，是一个立场问题，是世界观的问题。愿不愿深入连队、深入基层，是坚持不坚持毛主席的革命路线、对毛主席忠不忠的大问题。龚丕成遵照毛主席的教导，长期地无条件地下连队、下基层，全心全意为部队服务，为人民群众服务。
    龚丕成每次下连队，都住在生活最艰苦的地方，干最累最脏的活。他想到自己年龄比连队干部大，资历比他们深，容易处于特殊地位，就经常学习毛主席的教导：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员”，自觉地和连队干部战士打成一片。他觉得战士们太好了，长年累月，日日夜夜，泥里滚，水里泡，只有一个心眼：跟着毛主席干革命。这样好的战士，这样好的阶级兄弟，怎么能不关心他们，为他们服务！为了阶级兄弟，龚丕成什么都乐意干。
    为了避免战士们上山时受到毒虫毒草毒树的伤害，他和几个同志专门上山采集毒物标本，帮助战士们识别这些毒物，虽然他自己受到伤害，但他不觉得苦。为了解决夏天战士们在紧张劳动后吃不下饭、体重下降的问题，他就和战士们一起上山作业，跟班劳动，细心观察，亲身体会，很快找出了常吃酸菜增进食欲的办法，虽然自己出大力，流大汗，但他不觉得累。为了解除战士们的病痛，在少药无药的困难条件下，他千方百计排除万难，把战士们的病迅速治好。去年四月，三营发生了痢疾病号，药物一时供应不上，他就想尽办法就地找草药。他听社员说山上有黄连，能治痢疾，第二天一早，就和一个卫生员上山去找。山上满是密林杂草，没有路，他们钻来钻去，衣服皮肤都划破了，找了一上午，连个黄连的影子也没找见。下午，他们遇上了一片沼泽地，龚丕成一不小心，扑通一下，半个身子都陷进泥水里。卫生员急忙去拉他，自己也陷下去了。两人好容易爬出来，满身泥水，而时间已是下午五点。但是他们没有泄气，共同学习毛主席的教导：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”两人互相鼓励，高唱着毛主席语录歌：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，继续前进，终于在密林深处找到了一大片黄连。全营的痢疾病号很快治好了。
    解放十几年来，中国赫鲁晓夫在医疗卫生战线推行反革命修正主义路线，引诱医务工作者追求名利，不去研究常见病、多发病的预防和治疗，脱离实际，脱离群众。龚丕成在和广大干部战士一起生活，一起工作，一起战斗中，深切体会到：常见病、多发病，对战士的健康，对部队的战斗力，影响最大，危害最大。为广大工农兵服务，就必须大力搞好这些病的预防和治疗。多年来，龚丕成怀着深厚的无产阶级感情，把工作重点放在连队，放在基层，放在常见病、多发病的预防和治疗上，用自己的实际行动狠狠地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫在医疗卫生战线推行的反革命修正主义路线。
    炎热的南方，部队野营时，厕所里苍蝇很多，容易传染疾病，威胁着部队和群众的健康。他就下定决心要解决这个问题。一次，龚丕成随部队野营，到了驻地，亲自动手帮助连队挖厕所，经过多次试验，还是没有减少苍蝇的繁殖。他毫不灰心，想啊想啊，忽然想起“蚊子怕亮，苍蝇怕暗”这个特点，就立即和战士们一起琢磨研究，同时挖了两个深坑，都只留一个小口，但一个用树条搭了棚，使坑内保持黑暗，一个没有搭棚，坑内能透进少量亮光。结果，搭棚的便坑没有生蛆，没有搭棚的便坑仍然生了蛆。接着，他又进一步试验，挖了五个暗坑，经常拿着手电筒，观察便坑内的变化。驻地群众来掏粪，他每次去仔细观察。一个多月过去了，这几个便坑，竟没有发现一条蛆。他总结出来的“口小、坑深、坑内黑，无蛆、少蝇、少臭味”的“野营厕所”的经验，迅速在当地部队推广，大大减少了痢疾等疾病的发生和传染。战士们高兴地说：“这一回，可解决了野营卫生防疫的大问题。”
    龚丕成就是这样全心全意为连队服务，扎扎实实地解决实际问题。他看到有的连队把蔬菜放在潮湿的地上，容易腐烂损耗，就冒着大雨上山砍来树条，搭起菜架，分层放置蔬菜，保证战士们得到应有的营养。他看到战士们在一个盆里洗碗，容易传染疾病，就向当地的泥瓦工人、陶瓷工人请教，给连队制成了简单经济实用的流水洗碗器。随着一个个实际问题的解决，连队卫生面貌迅速改观，常见病、多发病逐渐减少，有力地保证了连队各项工作的进行。
    龚丕成不仅注意预防一般情况下发生的疾病，还十分注意预防不同部队在不同条件下发生的常见病、多发病。当他了解到运输分队患胃病、肠道病的人多，就和驾驶员们一起出车，一起装卸货物，一起吃饭，一起休息。经过半个多月的体验观察，他发现驾驶员流动分散，生活不规律，接触社会面广，是产生这些疾病的主要原因。他便向战士们进行卫生防疫教育，建议领导采取积极措施，对防止疾病的发生和传染，起了良好的作用。
    龚丕成牢记毛主席的伟大教导：“白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。”他对干部战士和人民群众满腔热情。驻地群众中的常见病、多发病，他也尽一切可能进行防治。去年三月，他带领医疗组到一个施工部队搞防疫工作，发现驻地村子里痢疾流行。由于中国赫鲁晓夫在医疗卫生战线推行反革命修正主义路线，使这里一无医，二无药，广大贫下中农长期受到疾病的侵害。龚丕成和医疗组的同志怀着对中国赫鲁晓夫的刻骨仇恨，怀着对社员群众深厚的无产阶级感情，看病上门，送药到手。经过一段治疗，绝大多数痢疾病人都治好了。他们还帮助社员整修厕所，清理水源，培养保健员，全村社员的精神面貌和卫生状况有了很大的变化，生产出勤率日益增高。他们临走时，社员们依依不舍地说：“毛主席派亲人来为我们贫下中农治病防病，我们永远不忘毛主席的恩情！”
    以政治统帅业务，把政治思想工作放在第一位
    毛主席教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂。龚丕成在防疫工作中，突出无产阶级政治，大力宣传毛泽东思想。他说：“我们改造客观世界，首先接触的是人，思想工作做好了，人们就会自觉地起来改造客观世界。搞卫生防疫工作，也是改造客观世界，只有发挥了人的因素，才能搞好。”因此，他每到一处，总是先抓政治思想，靠群众的觉悟，自觉地去把事情办好。
    一次，龚丕成带领医疗组，到一个水库工地工作，发现担任采石的九连病号比较多，经过了解，原来这个连的领导对卫生工作不够重视。医疗组的同志很着急，有的提议把这个情况报告上级处理。但龚丕成想：医疗组是来解决问题的，问题没解决，是工作没有做到家。他对大家说：“办好一件事情，要先做好思想工作，单靠行政命令，不能解决问题。”怎么办呢？他在调查中，了解到这个连有一个排，防疫工作做得好，三年没有发生痢疾病号。龚丕成和医疗组一起，总结了这个排突出无产阶级政治，搞好卫生防疫工作的经验，主动向连里汇报。这样一来，促进了九连的领导，他们专门召开支委会研究防疫工作。炊事班有两名炊事员得了痢疾病，需要调换，龚丕成就热情地和九连干部一起做好调换人员的思想工作，组织全连同志学习“老三篇”，用张思德“完全”“彻底”的革命精神，和白求恩两个“极端”的高贵品德教育战士。战士们的思想认识提高了，不少同志踊跃报名到炊事班工作，不仅圆满地解决了调换人员的问题，而且在群众中进行了一次生动的毛泽东思想的教育。经过这番工作，九连的卫生防疫工作开展起来了。
    龚丕成在开展防疫工作中，处处突出无产阶级政治，处处结出丰硕的果实。他深有体会地说：“只要善于用毛泽东思想宣传群众，武装群众，就没有克服不了的困难。”所以，他每次下连队，来到炊事班，第一件事是和炊事员一起学习《为人民服务》，帮助炊事员以张思德为榜样，搞好炊事工作；他和卫生人员谈心，首先共同学习《纪念白求恩》，教育卫生人员象白求恩那样，对工作极端的负责任，对同志对人民极端的热忱。他给连里上卫生课，首先组织学习毛主席有关卫生工作的指示，讲伟大领袖毛主席为人类解放事业操心，还时刻关心着我们每个战士的健康，激发大家对伟大领袖毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情。他认为，军队是要打仗的，讲卫生课应该是鼓舞士气，激励斗志，使战士们在战火纷飞的战场上敢于同敌人战斗。因此，上卫生课时，他常这样讲：“人的生命是宝贵的，但不好好为人民服务，就毫无意义。董存瑞、黄继光等英雄人物，是万古长青的。”每次卫生课都讲得深刻实际，生动感人。同志们听了，觉得心里热呼呼的，都说：“这不仅是一堂卫生课，而且是一次生动的学习毛泽东思想的辅导课。”
    龚丕成在深入连队的过程中，十分注意向战士学习，努力改造自己的世界观。他深深体会到：连队不仅是我为战士服务的广阔天地，更是我改造世界观的最好场所。下一次连队，就是进一次毛泽东思想学习班，战士就是最好的教员，战士们活学活用毛主席著作的生动事迹，就是最好的教材。如果只蹲在城市里，躲在机关里，关在房子里，停留在书本上，是一辈子也改造不好自己的世界观的。
