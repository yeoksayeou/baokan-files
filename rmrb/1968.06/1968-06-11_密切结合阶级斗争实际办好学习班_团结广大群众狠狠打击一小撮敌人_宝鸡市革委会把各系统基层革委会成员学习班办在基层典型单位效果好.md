The Revolutionary Committee of Baoji City, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's support-leftist troops, has moved the study classes for members of the revolutionary committees at the grassroots level of various systems to typical grassroots units. By linking the current class struggle with reality, they have actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and studied the brilliant deeds of Comrade Dong Cunrui. This has greatly raised the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines among the students. They have followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and launched a more fierce attack on the class enemies.

Since this spring, revolutionary committees have emerged one after another in various systems at the grassroots level in Baoji City, and the revolutionary situation is excellent. In this excellent situation, a handful of class enemies, unwilling to admit defeat, have adopted more covert means, directing their struggle against the newly born revolutionary committees, attempting to overthrow the revolutionary power of the proletariat. In response to the new trends in class struggle, the Revolutionary Committee of Baoji City and the support-leftist troops decided to hold study classes on Mao Zedong Thought for members of the grassroots revolutionary committees. They used Chairman Mao's theories and latest instructions on class struggle to further arm the minds of the grassroots revolutionary committee members, launching a more fierce attack on the class enemies. Based on past experiences, they decided to move the study classes to the grassroots units. The Qinchuang Machine Tool Factory, following Chairman Mao's instructions, has been vigorously promoting the great criticism, strictly distinguishing between the two types of contradictions, uniting the vast majority of the masses and cadres, and severely striking a handful of stubborn class enemies, traitors, spies, and other counter-revolutionaries. This has promoted the widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought and the rapid development of the revolution and production, making it a model for the city in intensifying class struggle. Since April, the City Revolutionary Committee has moved the study classes on Mao Zedong Thought for members of the grassroots revolutionary committees to the Qinchuang Machine Tool Factory. Each class lasts only one week, with concise and focused learning content, concentrating on studying and deeply understanding Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. At the same time, they invited comrades from the Revolutionary Committee of the Qinchuang Machine Tool Factory to share their experiences. The students also participated in the struggle meetings of this factory and conducted discussions and visits. Then, according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions, they linked their thoughts with the class struggle reality of their own units, identified gaps, and summarized experiences.

Great Leader Chairman Mao recently taught us: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and the revolutionary masses it leads and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Through repeated study, the students deeply understood that Chairman Mao's brilliant instruction is a sharp weapon for deepening the struggle against the enemy and achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They expressed their determination to remember Chairman Mao's great teachings of "never forgetting class struggle" and "believing in and relying on the masses," to mobilize the masses, correctly handle the two types of contradictions, and firmly, accurately, and severely strike a handful of class enemies.

In the study classes, everyone raised the transformation of their worldview to the height of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, consciously fighting against private interests and criticizing revisionism. They said that only by fiercely fighting against the "private" interests of the bourgeoisie can the "public" interests of the proletariat be firmly established, and only then can one be like Comrade Dong Cunrui, hating the enemy, loving comrades, being strict with oneself, uniting the broad masses, and always directing the struggle against a handful of class enemies.

The comrades who participated in the study class held at the Qinchuang Machine Tool Factory spread the experiences of the Qinchuang Machine Tool Factory widely after returning to their own units.

Through holding such study classes, the deepening of the city-wide revolutionary criticism has been further promoted, and a more fierce attack has been launched on the class enemies. Currently, many factories, schools, offices, and shops in the city have held multiple struggle and criticism meetings, exposing and criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist goods promoted by China's Khrushchev and his agents in this region and unit, eliminating their poison, severely striking the sabotage activities of the class enemies, and greatly boosting the morale of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. In the storm of class struggle, the newly born revolutionary committees have been further consolidated and developed, and the revolution and production have shown a thriving new situation.

    密切结合阶级斗争实际办好学习班
    团结广大群众狠狠打击一小撮敌人
    宝鸡市革委会把各系统基层革委会成员学习班办在基层典型单位效果好
    据新华社西安十日电　陕西省宝鸡市革命委员会在人民解放军支左部队的帮助下，把各系统基层单位革命委员会成员毛泽东思想学习班搬到基层典型单位去办，结合当前阶级斗争的实际，活学活用毛主席的最新指示，学习门合同志的光辉事迹，大大提高了学员们阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。他们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，向阶级敌人发动了更加猛烈的进攻。
    今春以来，宝鸡市各系统基层单位革命委员会联翩出现，革命形势一片大好。在这大好形势下，一小撮阶级敌人不甘心失败，采取更加隐蔽的手段，把斗争矛头指向新生的革命委员会，妄图颠覆无产阶级的革命政权。针对阶级斗争的新动向，宝鸡市革命委员会和支左部队决定举办基层革命委员会成员毛泽东思想学习班，用毛主席关于阶级斗争的理论和最新指示进一步武装基层革命委员会成员的头脑，向阶级敌人发动更加猛烈的进攻。他们根据以往的经验，决定把学习班搬到基层单位去办。秦川机床厂遵照毛主席的指示，狠抓革命的大批判，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，团结绝大多数群众和干部，狠狠打击了一小撮顽固不化的走资派、叛徒、特务和其他反革命分子，促进了毛泽东思想的大普及，促进了革命和生产的迅速发展，是全市狠抓阶级斗争的样板。市革命委员会从四月份开始，便把基层革命委员会成员毛泽东思想学习班搬到秦川机床厂去办。学习班每期只用一周时间，学习内容少而精，集中学习和深刻领会毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的最新指示。同时，请秦川机床厂革命委员会的同志介绍经验。学员们也参加这个厂的批斗会，并且进行座谈、访问。然后，再按照毛主席的最新指示，联系思想，联系本单位的阶级斗争实际，找差距，总结经验。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”学员们通过反复的学习，深刻地认识到，毛主席的这一光辉指示，是深入开展对敌斗争，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的锐利武器。他们表示，一定要牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”和“要相信和依靠群众”的伟大教导，放手发动群众，正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾，稳、准、狠地坚决打击一小撮阶级敌人。
    在学习班里，大家都把世界观的改造提高到阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的高度来认识，自觉地斗私批修。他们说，只有对资产阶级“私”字斗得狠，无产阶级“公”字才能树得牢，才能做到象门合同志那样对敌人恨，对同志亲，对自己严，团结广大群众，始终把斗争矛头指向一小撮阶级敌人。
    参加在秦川机床厂举办的学习班的同志们回到本单位以后，广泛传播了秦川机床厂的经验。
    通过办这样的学习班，进一步促进了全市革命大批判的深入开展，向阶级敌人展开了更加猛烈的进攻。目前，全市许多工厂、学校、机关、商店，多次召开批判斗争大会，大揭大批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本地区、本单位代理人推行的反革命修正主义黑货，肃清其流毒，狠狠打击阶级敌人的破坏活动，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气。在阶级斗争的风暴中，新生的革命委员会得到了进一步的巩固和发展，革命和生产出现了蓬勃发展的新局面。
