The "Support the Left, Love the People Model Platoon" criticizes the "survival philosophy" of the Chinese Khrushchev.

Comrade Pang Chaosheng, a former comrade-in-arms of martyr Li Wenzhong and a recipient of the First-Class Merit Citation, the deputy platoon leader of the Sixth Company, braved the raging waters of the river to rescue eight Red Guards, truly putting the Party's interests first. He denounced the Chinese Khrushchev:

Do not dare to defile us with your "survival philosophy"!

The multiple-time traitor Chinese Khrushchev, with his mind full of selfishness and his mouth full of "I," hypocritically uses the pretext of protecting Party members to peddle the black goods of the bourgeois "survival philosophy," falsely claiming that "in necessary times, one must abandon some of the Party's work to preserve comrades." This is nothing but an attempt to exonerate traitors and to corrupt our Party and poison the broad masses of Party members.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Communist Party members, no matter when or where, should not place personal interests first, but should subordinate personal interests to the interests of the nation and the people." We deeply understand that the interests of the Party, the people, and the revolution are paramount. When they are threatened, Communist Party members must strive to protect them, and if necessary, even sacrifice their own lives. They must not be afraid of death or sacrifice the Party's interests for personal gain, and they must not betray the Party.

On August 19, 1967, we escorted a group of proletarian revolutionaries and Red Guards across the Gan River to return home and make revolution. When the boat reached the middle of the river, the current was strong, and the water splashed over the side of the boat, flooding the cabin. A dangerous situation arose where the boat could sink and people could drown. If it were the Chinese Khrushchev, he would definitely think only of saving himself. However, the revolutionary warriors armed with Mao Zedong Thought had only the Party's interests in mind. They followed Chairman Mao's teachings to "put revolutionary interests first" and "be ready to sacrifice their lives for our cause at any time." Facing the danger, everyone was fearless and took the lead. Our excellent platoon leader, Li Wenzhong, held up the red book and loudly recited Chairman Mao's quotations: "Be resolute, fear no sacrifice, and surmount every difficulty to win victory." At that moment, my only thought was: Protecting the Red Guards is protecting Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Even if I die, I must complete the task given by the Party. Mao Zedong Thought gave me boundless strength. In the raging waters, I rescued eight Red Guards one after another. Through the joint efforts of all the comrades in the platoon, more than fifty revolutionary fighters and Red Guards were saved. However, Li Wenzhong, Li Congquan, and Chen Tiankui sacrificed their lives. They used their lives to protect the Party's interests.

Revolutionary warriors armed with Mao Zedong Thought have the reddest hearts and the brightest eyes. The Chinese Khrushchev will never be able to defile our sublime thoughts with his "survival philosophy." Let the Chinese Khrushchev and his "survival philosophy" go to hell!

Revolutionary warriors armed with Mao Zedong Thought are all heroes standing tall and firm, ready to sacrifice their lives for the revolution at any time. Comrade Qin Xueyi, a recipient of the Third-Class Merit Citation and deputy squad leader, said with a firm voice:

	For the revolution, shedding blood and sacrificing one's life is heavier than Mount Tai;
	For personal gain, fearing death and seeking to live is infamous for eternity.

	Thieves have their logic, and traitors have their philosophy.

	The extreme egoist Chinese Khrushchev peddles his "survival philosophy" everywhere, barking like a mad dog: "Those who say they are not afraid of death may not necessarily be firm when the time comes."

	"Our Chinese nation has the spirit to fight to the death with our enemies." Opening the glorious history of the Chinese revolution, how many revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary predecessors, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, faced the enemy's guns and butcher's knives, laughed in the face of death, and shed their hot blood to dye the globe red. They sang triumphant songs to bury the old world and exchanged their blood for today's happiness. The Chinese Khrushchev's slander does not diminish the glory of the revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary predecessors, but only exposes the Chinese Khrushchev's ugly soul. It is this scoundrel, dressed in the guise of an "old revolutionary," who, to save his own dog's life, is willing to sell his soul, betray the Party and comrades, and crawl out of the enemy's doghole several times, becoming a despicable traitor.

	The comrades of our Fourth Platoon all have a red heart loyal to Chairman Mao. We fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line when we live, and we dedicate our lives to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line when we die. In the battle to rescue the Red Guards, we fulfilled our oath with actual actions. Li Wenzhong, Li Congquan, and Chen Tiankui sacrificed their lives, but they died for the people's interests. Their deaths are heavier than Mount Tai. The heroic deeds of Li Wenzhong and others are the sternest criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev's "survival philosophy." The heroic deeds of Li Wenzhong and others will be remembered forever, while the traitorous acts of the Chinese Khrushchev will be infamous for eternity.

	In times of danger, does a commander take the lead or retreat in fear? Comrade Ma Shouzeng, a recipient of the Second-Class Merit Citation and platoon leader of the Fourth Platoon, refuted the Chinese Khrushchev's fallacies with the facts he witnessed of Li Wenzhong commanding the rescue of the Red Guards. He said excitedly: Communist Party members are fearless in danger and always stand on the front line of the struggle.

	The Chinese Khrushchev, with his old counter-revolutionary heart, falsely claims: "A good commander, when fighting, says in words that only victory is allowed, and defeat is not allowed, but in fact, he has a plan in his heart, that if defeated, he will still 'run away.'" This is a slander against our great army and a roundabout way of advocating the "survival philosophy."

	The great commander Chairman Mao teaches us: "Communist Party members in the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army should become models of bravery in battle, models of executing orders, and models of observing discipline..." Our excellent platoon leader Li Wenzhong is such a person. In the battle to rescue the Red Guards last August 19, Li Wenzhong completely followed Chairman Mao's teachings and demonstrated the sublime qualities of a commander of the people's army. When the cabin was flooded, he remained calm and composed, holding up the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and loudly reciting Chairman Mao's teachings: "Be resolute, fear no sacrifice, and surmount every difficulty to win victory" to encourage his comrades. When the danger of the boat sinking and people drowning arose, he issued orders to rescue firmly and jumped into the river, rescuing five young comrades one after another. In his last moments, he was still commanding the battle, ordering his comrades to rescue the Red Guards first. Li Wenzhong was always loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and always stood at the forefront of the revolutionary struggle. He was fearless in danger, and at the most dangerous moment, he did not think of "running away" at all. Li Wenzhong's shout of "Don't mind me" was a dagger piercing the black heart of the Chinese Khrushchev, and Li Wenzhong's heroic deeds were a fatal blow to the "survival philosophy."

	Li Wenzhong set an example for us. Today, I take over the platoon leader's position and will definitely follow his example, remembering Chairman Mao's teachings, and in any difficult and dangerous situation, I will be brave and firm, endure hardships first, and charge forward, always standing on the front line of the struggle.

	Determined to inherit the heroic will, turn the heroic wish into a grand blueprint. The younger brothers Li Wenhong of martyr Li Wenzhong, Li Congwei of Li Congquan, and Chen Tianbing of Chen Tiankui are growing and tempering themselves in the great crucible of the People's Liberation Army. They are determined to turn their heroic examples into reality with actual actions:

	Learn from the heroes' examples
	Walk the heroes' path

	The Chinese Khrushchev, this coward, always tries every means to save his own dog's life so that he can engage in counter-revolutionary activities within the Party. In his black "On Cultivation," he openly advocates "loving oneself and protecting one's life and health," which is truly shameless!

	We revolutionary warriors listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. For the revolutionary cause, we can "sacrifice everything personal." Last August 19, the heroic warriors of Chairman Mao, Li Wenzhong, Li Congquan, and Chen Tiankui, sacrificed their lives to rescue the revolutionary young comrades of the Red Guards, setting a good example for us to learn from.

	This spring, we supported the left in the Jiangxi Cotton Spinning and Dyeing Factory. Due to a spark from an electric fire, a fire broke out in a workshop. Fire is the order, and the fire scene is the battlefield. Mao Zedong Thought guided us, and the images of heroes like Li Wenzhong inspired us. We and all the comrades in the company bravely rushed to the rescue, daring to sacrifice ourselves. Where the smoke was thickest, we rushed in, and where the fire was fiercest, we charged forward! When clearing the toxic gas in the ventilation duct, due to smoke and fire, Li Congwei comrade fainted twice from carbon monoxide poisoning. At this time, if he had followed the Chinese Khrushchev's fallacy of "loving oneself and protecting one's life and health," he would have retreated, and then state property would have been damaged, and people's lives would have been threatened. However, Li Congwei comrade remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "To die for the people is to die a worthy death," and got up and rushed in again. When comrades sent him to the hospital and told him that the fire had been extinguished and state property had been saved, he finally relaxed.

	The Chinese Khrushchev peddles the decadent bourgeois "survival philosophy" to make people give up the struggle and betray the revolution when the revolutionary struggle requires sacrificing their lives. However, his tricks do not work on us revolutionary warriors. With Mao Zedong Thought as our guide and revolutionary heroes as our examples, we will forever walk the path that the heroes have walked, and we are always ready to contribute everything, including our lives, to the cause of communism!

### “支左爱民模范排”批判中国赫鲁晓夫“活命哲学”

    “支左爱民模范排”批判中国赫鲁晓夫“活命哲学”
    李文忠烈士生前战友、一等功荣立者、六连副连长庞朝胜同志，在滔滔江水中劈波斩浪，连续救起了八个红卫兵，真正做到把党的利益放在第一位。他怒斥中国赫鲁晓夫：
    休想用“活命哲学”玷污我们
    多次叛变的中国赫鲁晓夫，满脑私字，满口“我”字，假惺惺地打着保护党员的招牌，大肆贩卖资产阶级“活命哲学”的黑货，胡说什么“在必要时还要放弃党的一些工作来保存同志。”这完全是为叛徒开脱罪责，并想以此腐蚀我们的党，毒害广大党员。
    毛主席教导我们：“共产党员无论何时何地都不应以个人利益放在第一位，而应以个人利益服从于民族的和人民群众的利益。”我们深深懂得，党的利益、人民的利益、革命的利益高于一切，在它们受到危害时，共产党员必须全力保护，必要时，甚至要献出自己的生命，而决不能贪生怕死、为了自己而牺牲党的利益，更不能背叛党。
    一九六七年八月十九日，我们护送一批无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将横渡赣江，返乡闹革命。船到江心激流，江水溅过船帮，漫进船舱，一场沉船落水的险情发生了。如果是中国赫鲁晓夫，一定是只顾自己逃命。但是，用毛泽东思想武装的革命战士，一心想的是党的利益。他们遵照毛主席的教导“以革命利益为第一生命”“随时准备拿出自己的生命去殉我们的事业”。面对险情，人人面无惧色，个个奋勇当先。我们的好排长李文忠高举红彤彤的宝书，大声朗诵毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”我当时心里只有一个想法：保卫红卫兵，就是保卫毛主席的革命路线，即使我死了，也要完成党交给的任务。毛泽东思想给了我无穷的力量，在滔滔江水中，我一连救出了八个红卫兵。经全排同志奋力战斗，五十多位革命派战士和红卫兵小将得救了，可是李文忠、李从全、陈佃奎三同志光荣牺牲了，他们用生命保护了党的利益。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，心最红，眼最亮，中国赫鲁晓夫休想用“活命哲学”玷污我们的崇高思想。让中国赫鲁晓夫和他的“活命哲学”一起见鬼去吧！
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，个个是顶天立地的英雄汉，随时准备为革命献出自己的生命。三等功荣立者、副班长秦学义铿锵有力地说：
    为革命流血牺牲重于泰山  为个人贪生怕死遗臭万年
    强盗有强盗的逻辑，叛徒有叛徒的哲学。
    极端利己主义者中国赫鲁晓夫，到处贩卖他的“活命哲学”，象疯狗一样狂吠什么：“那些口里说不怕死的人，到时候并不一定坚定。”
    “我们中华民族有同自己的敌人血战到底的气概”。打开中国革命的光荣史册，有多少革命先烈和革命前辈，在毛泽东思想哺育下，在敌人的枪口前，在敌人的屠刀下，面对死亡冲天笑，甘洒热血染全球。他们高唱凯歌埋葬旧世界，用鲜血换来了幸福的今天。中国赫鲁晓夫的污蔑，丝毫无损于革命先烈和革命前辈的光辉，而只能暴露中国赫鲁晓夫自己的丑恶灵魂。正是这个披着“老革命”外衣的家伙，为了保住自己的一条狗命，不惜出卖灵魂，出卖党和同志，几次从敌人的狗洞里爬出来，成为可耻的叛徒。
    我们四排的同志，人人都有一颗忠于毛主席的红心，生为毛主席的革命路线而战斗，死为毛主席的革命路线而献身。在抢救红卫兵的战斗中，我们以实际行动执行了自己的誓言，李文忠、李从全、陈佃奎同志牺牲了，可是他们是为人民利益而死的，他们的死是比泰山还要重的。李文忠等同志的英雄行为，是对中国赫鲁晓夫“活命哲学”的最严厉的批判。李文忠等同志的英雄事迹将流芳百世，而中国赫鲁晓夫的叛徒行径将遗臭万年。
    在危急关头，一个指挥员是奋勇当先，还是畏缩后退？二等功荣立者、四排长马守增以目睹李文忠同志指挥抢救红卫兵的事实，驳斥了中国赫鲁晓夫的谬论。他激动地说：共产党员临危不惧永远站在斗争前线
    中国赫鲁晓夫用自己的老反革命之心度革命战士的胸怀，胡说什么“一个好的指挥官在作战时，口里讲的是只准打胜仗，不准打败仗，其实心里有个打算，万一打败了还不是要‘开溜’。”这是对我们伟大军队的污蔑，也是在拐弯抹角地宣扬“活命哲学”。
    伟大统帅毛主席教导我们：“共产党员在八路军和新四军中，应该成为英勇作战的模范，执行命令的模范，遵守纪律的模范……”我们的好排长李文忠就是这样的人。在去年八月十九日抢救红卫兵的战斗中，李文忠同志完全按照毛主席的教导，表现了一个人民军队指挥员的崇高品质。当船舱浸水时，他镇静自若，高举红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高声朗诵毛主席的教导“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”以鼓励同志们。当沉船落水的险情一发生，他一边果断地下达抢救的命令，一边跃入江中，一连救出了五个小将。就在他生命的最后一刻，仍然指挥战斗，命令战友抢救红卫兵要紧。李文忠同志永远忠于毛主席的革命路线，永远站在革命斗争的最前列，他临危不惧，在最危险的时候，他丝毫没有想到“开溜”。李文忠同志的“不要管我”的喊声，就是刺向中国赫鲁晓夫黑心烂肺的匕首，李文忠同志的英雄行为，就是对“活命哲学”的致命一击。
    李文忠同志为我们作出了榜样。今天，我接过排长的班，一定要象他那样，牢记毛主席的教导，无论在任何艰难困苦的场合，都要勇敢、坚定，吃苦在前，冲锋在前，永远站在斗争最前线。
    决心继承英雄志，誓将遗愿化宏图。烈士李文忠的弟弟李文红、李从全的哥哥李从卫、陈佃奎的弟弟陈佃兵，正在解放军这座大熔炉里锻炼成长。他们决心以实际行动——
    学英雄的榜样  走英雄的道路
    中国赫鲁晓夫这个怕死鬼，总是想方设法保住自己的一条狗命，以便在党内进行反革命活动。他在那本黑《修养》里，公开鼓吹要“钟爱自己，保护自己的生命与健康”，真是恬不知耻！
    我们革命战士最听毛主席的话，为了革命利益，可以“不惜牺牲自己个人的一切”。去年八月十九日，毛主席的好战士李文忠、李从全、陈佃奎烈士为了抢救红卫兵革命小将而牺牲生命的英雄行为，是我们学习的好榜样。
    今年春天，我们在江西棉纺印染厂支左，一个车间因电火迸发，引起了一场火灾。火光就是命令，火场就是战场。毛泽东思想指引着我们，李文忠等英雄形象鼓舞着我们。我们和全连同志一起不怕牺牲，英勇抢救，那里烟最大，就往那里闯，那里火最旺，就往那里冲！在排除通风道里的毒气时，由于烟熏火燎，一氧化碳中毒，李从卫同志两次昏倒。在这个时候，如果依了中国赫鲁晓夫“钟爱自己，保护自己的生命与健康”的谬论，他就会退下来，那么国家财产就会遭受损失，群众生命就要受到威胁。可是，李从卫同志牢记毛主席“为人民而死，就是死得其所”的教导，爬起来，又冲了进去。当同志们把他送到医院，告诉他火扑灭了，国家财产保住了的时候，他才放了心。
    中国赫鲁晓夫大肆贩卖资产阶级腐朽的“活命哲学”，无非是要人们在革命斗争需要献出自己生命的时候，放弃斗争，背叛革命。可是，他的这一套对我们革命战士是行不通的。有毛泽东思想作指导，有革命英雄为榜样，我们将永远走英雄走过的道路，随时准备为共产主义事业贡献出自己的一切，直至献出生命！
