Title: Do Not Forget Thrift After a Bountiful Harvest

This year, our region has seen a bumper harvest of wheat, barley, and other summer crops. Recently, I visited several counties and found that the average yield of wheat per mu was over 300 jin, with some fields yielding as much as 500 jin per mu. This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." It is the result of the hard work and diligent efforts of the broad masses of commune members. Therefore, we must cherish this hard-won victory.

Currently, all the wheat has been harvested and threshed. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres are actively following the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions to "be thrifty and make revolution" and "tightly control grain." They are meticulously harvesting and threshing. In the Li Xin Brigade of Chengguan Commune in Liu'an County, I saw that during threshing, they carefully picked up every single stalk of wheat left on the threshing floor and in the fields. They threshed very carefully, truly ensuring that every grain is collected. Apart from fulfilling the state's procurement tasks, the collective has reserved enough seeds, feed, and a certain amount of reserves, and ensured that each household has enough rations. The surplus grain, after discussion among the poor and lower-middle peasants, was unanimously agreed to be sold to the state. They said: We have had a bumper harvest, and we must remember Chairman Mao's teachings, resolutely support socialist construction, and resolutely support the world revolution.

However, I also noticed that some production brigades are careless with their grain harvest, threshing carelessly and not picking up the fallen stalks, and not sweeping the threshing floor clean. Because of poor storage, some wheat has already sprouted. There are also some production brigades that, as soon as the wheat is harvested, squander it by holding large banquets with collective grain. This behavior must be immediately stopped and not allowed to continue.

Thrift is a precious tradition of ours, the poor and lower-middle peasants. Even after a bumper harvest, we must maintain this good tradition. Only by adhering to thrift can we further implement Chairman Mao's great strategic policy of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people," and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    丰收不忘勤俭节约
    今年我们这里的大麦、小麦和其它夏熟作物都获得了丰收。前些时，我跑了几个县，看到一般的小麦每亩可收三百多斤，好的可能亩产五百斤。这是毛主席“抓革命，促生产”方针的伟大胜利，是广大社员艰苦奋斗、辛勤劳动得来的，因此我们必须珍惜这个胜利的果实。
    目前，大小麦已全部收割登场，广大贫下中农和革命干部，积极遵循伟大领袖毛主席关于“要节约闹革命”和“必须把粮食抓紧”的指示，正在精收细打。我在六安县城郊公社立新大队新河生产队，看到他们在脱粒时，将场头、田头丢的麦穗都一穗穗地捡起来，脱粒也很认真，真正做到了颗粒归仓。他们除了完成国家的征购任务，集体留足了种子、饲料和一定的储备，每户分足口粮外，超产的粮食，经贫下中农讨论，一致同意卖给国家。他们说：我们丰收了，要牢记毛主席的教导，坚决支援社会主义建设，坚决支援世界革命。
    可是我也发现有个别生产队，粮食丰收了便满不在乎，脱粒很不认真，见了丢掉的麦穗不拾，场头也扫得不干净。因为保管得不好，有的麦子已经发芽。还有个别生产队，麦子刚收下来，就大手大脚，拿集体的粮食搞大会餐。这种行为必须立即制止，不能任其发展。
    勤俭节约是咱们贫下中农的传家宝，丰收了也要保持这个好传统。只有坚持勤俭节约，才能进一步落实毛主席关于“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大战略方针，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
