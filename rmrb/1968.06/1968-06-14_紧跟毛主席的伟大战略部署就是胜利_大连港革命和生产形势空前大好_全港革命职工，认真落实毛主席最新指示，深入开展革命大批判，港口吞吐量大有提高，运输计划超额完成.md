The great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin's warm reception of the representatives attending the national railway and transportation conference has greatly inspired the revolutionary workers of Dalian Port. They follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, earnestly study, and comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, launch a fierce attack on the class enemy, and strive to improve transportation. Currently, the revolutionary and production situation in the entire port is exceptionally good.

In Dalian Port, Mao Zedong Thought has never been as deeply rooted in people's hearts as it is now. Revolutionary workers have never been as spirited, full of vigor, and full of fighting spirit as they are now. Since this year, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, the port has opened more than 180 types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with over 9,000 people participating in the studies. In these classes, they, with hearts full of loyalty to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, take "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the key, use Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a sharp weapon, focus on the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, fight against "selfishness," and establish "public spirit." They gradually overcome bourgeois factionalism and anarchist tendencies, enhance proletarian party spirit and proletarian revolutionary discipline, improve class struggle awareness and two-line struggle consciousness, and achieve revolutionary great unity in more than 94% of the grassroots units.

Dalian Port is an important port for China's foreign trade and a crucial hub for south-north sea and land transportation. For a long time, class struggle in Dalian Port has been extremely sharp and complex. A handful of stubborn class enemies, traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries, unwilling to accept their doom, have been manipulating from behind the scenes, openly fighting, and using conspiracies and secret arrows during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have been trying every means to sabotage Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. They instigate the masses to fight each other, split the ranks of the working class, and stir up anarchism and counter-revolutionary economism, sabotaging transportation and production, attempting to restore capitalism. The broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary workers of the proletariat, remembering the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle," hold high the revolutionary banner of "it is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries," and launch a fierce attack on China's Khrushchev and his agents in Dalian Port. The broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary workers deeply understand that the focus of this movement is to fight against those within the party who are in power taking the capitalist road. Therefore, they concentrate all their hatred on the handful of those within the party who are in power taking the capitalist road, led by China's Khrushchev. They follow the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of the revolution, and also the primary question of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," strictly distinguish and correctly handle the two types of different contradictions, unite and strengthen their class ranks to the greatest extent, and isolate and strike the class enemy to the greatest extent. They concentrate their firepower and targets, fiercely expose and criticize China's Khrushchev and his agents in Dalian Port, closely combine the revolutionary great criticism with the actual class struggle in their units, and accurately and fiercely strike the class enemy, digging out those hidden traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries one by one.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolution is the liberation of productive forces, revolution is the promotion of the development of productive forces." Since the realization of revolutionary great unity in Dalian Port and the joint struggle against the class enemy, everyone has worked together to improve transportation, and the production situation has become better and better. In April, the port's cargo throughput increased by 17.69% compared to the average of the first quarter, and in May, it increased by 22.5% compared to April, exceeding the May port transportation plan by 8.7%, reaching the highest level since August last year. Especially the revolutionary workers in the oil area, with hearts full of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, work day and night, guard their posts, focus on the revolution, and promote production with a revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day." Without increasing manpower and equipment, they have completed the oil transportation plan in excess every month, and in May, they created the highest monthly production record in the history of the oil area.

    紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署就是胜利
    大连港革命和生产形势空前大好
    全港革命职工，认真落实毛主席最新指示，深入开展革命大批判，港口吞吐量大有提高，运输计划超额完成
    新华社沈阳十三日电　伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席亲切接见出席全国铁路、交通会议代表的喜讯，极大地鼓舞了大连海港广大革命职工。他们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，认真学习、全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，深入开展革命大批判，向阶级敌人展开了猛烈进攻，努力搞好运输，目前，全港革命和生产形势空前大好。
    在大连海港，毛泽东思想从来没有象现在这样深入人心，广大革命职工从来没有象现在这样精神振奋，意气风发，斗志昂扬。今年以来，在人民解放军的帮助下，全港已开办了一百八十多期各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，有九千多人次参加了学习。在学习班里，他们怀着无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席革命路线的红心，以“斗私，批修”为纲，以毛主席最新指示为锐利武器，狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，狠斗“私”字，大立“公”字，逐渐克服了资产阶级派性和无政府主义思潮，增强了无产阶级党性和无产阶级的革命纪律性，提高了阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争觉悟，使全港百分之九十四以上的基层单位实现了革命大联合。
    大连港是我国对外贸易的重要港口，是南北海陆交通的重要枢纽。长期以来，大连海港阶级斗争非常尖锐复杂。一小撮顽固不化的走资派和叛徒、特务、反革命分子不甘心于他们的灭亡，他们在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，时而幕后操纵，时而赤膊上阵，时而耍阴谋放暗箭，千方百计地破坏毛主席的伟大战略部署。他们挑动群众斗群众，分裂工人阶级队伍，煽动无政府主义和反革命经济主义妖风，破坏运输生产，妄图复辟资本主义。广大无产阶级革命派和革命职工牢记伟大领袖毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，高举“对反动派造反有理”的革命大旗，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在大连港的代理人，发动了猛烈进攻。广大革命职工和革命群众深刻地认识到：这次运动的重点，是斗争那些党内走资派。因此，他们把千仇万恨，都凝集在以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派身上。他们遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题，也是文化大革命的首要问题”的教导，严格区分和正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾，最大限度地团结和壮大自己的阶级队伍，最大限度地孤立和打击阶级敌人。集中火力、集中目标，狠揭狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在大连港的代理人，把革命的大批判与本单位的阶级斗争实际紧密结合起来，稳、准、狠地打击阶级敌人，把那些隐藏的叛徒、特务、反革命分子一个个地挖了出来。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“革命就是解放生产力，革命就是促进生产力的发展”。大连港自从实现革命大联合，共同向阶级敌人展开斗争以后，大家齐心协力搞好运输，生产形势越来越好。四月份港口吞吐量比第一季度平均提高百分之十七点六九，五月份又比四月份提高百分之二十二点五，超额百分之八点七完成了五月份的港口运输计划，达到了自去年八月份以来的最高水平。特别是油区的广大革命职工，怀着无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的红心，日夜奋战，坚守岗位，狠抓革命，猛促生产，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，在没有增加人力和设备的情况下，月月超额完成油运计划，五月份又创造了油区月度生产的历史最高纪录。
