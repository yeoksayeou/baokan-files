In the intense struggle among the U.S. monopoly capitalist class to seize the throne of the next U.S. President, Robert Kennedy, the brother of former U.S. President John Kennedy and a U.S. Senator, was shot and killed on June 5 while campaigning for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination in Los Angeles.

The United States will stage its quadrennial "election" farce this year to "elect" a President and members of Congress. Currently, the pre-election activities for presidential candidates are underway. Various politicians representing different interest groups within the Democratic and Republican parties, which are tools of the U.S. monopoly capitalist class, are engaged in intense, backstabbing struggles to win the presidential nomination.

Robert Kennedy was a candidate for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination and was assassinated after winning the primary in California.

In the U.S. monopoly capitalist class's election activities, such assassination incidents occur, reflecting the deepening political and economic crises of U.S. imperialism. As the U.S. war in Vietnam suffers repeated defeats, the financial and economic crises worsen, and the domestic people's struggles surge, the reactionary rule of the U.S. monopoly capitalist class becomes increasingly unstable, and the infighting within the ruling clique reaches an unprecedented level.

Some U.S. congressmen recently exclaimed: The U.S. ruling clique is facing a "national disaster."

Four years ago, former U.S. President John Kennedy was assassinated in Texas; now, his brother Robert Kennedy has been shot dead during the election. This once again shows that the struggle for power and position within the U.S. monopoly capitalist class is intensifying. This is another manifestation of the increasing decay and accelerating decline of U.S. imperialism.

    在竞选总统候选人的勾心斗角中
    美参议员罗·肯尼迪被刺身死
    新华社七日讯　华盛顿消息：在美国垄断资产阶级为争夺美国下一届总统的宝座而展开的激烈的角逐中，美国前总统约翰·肯尼迪的弟弟、参议员罗伯特·肯尼迪，五日在洛杉矶市进行民主党总统候选人提名的竞争活动时，遭到枪击，六日死去。
    美国今年将上演四年一次的“大选”丑剧，“选举”总统和国会议员；目前正在进行总统候选人的预选活动。美国垄断资产阶级的工具民主党和共和党中代表各个不同利益集团的一些政客，都在为竞选总统候选人而紧张地进行着勾心斗角的搏斗。
    罗伯特·肯尼迪是民主党的总统候选人提名竞选者，他是在加利福尼亚州预选中获胜后被刺身死的。
    在美国垄断资产阶级的竞选活动中，发生这样的暗杀事件，是美帝国主义政治、经济危机不断加深的又一个反映。随着美国侵越战争屡遭惨败、财政经济危机不断发展、国内人民斗争汹涌澎湃，美国垄断资产阶级的反动统治越来越不稳定，统治集团内部的狗咬狗的斗争空前加剧。
    美国有的议员最近惊呼：美国统治集团面临“全国性灾难”。
    四年前，美国前总统约翰·肯尼迪在得克萨斯州遭暗杀；如今，他的弟弟罗伯特·肯尼迪又在竞选中被刺死。这再次表明，美国垄断资产阶级争权夺势的斗争愈演愈烈。这是美帝国主义日益腐朽和加速没落的又一表现。
