The Dutch leftist publication "Communist" recently published an article titled "Mao Zedong's Historical Role in the Development of Scientific Socialism," enthusiastically praising Chairman Mao's immense contributions to the development of Marxism-Leninism. The main points of the article are summarized as follows:

The article points out that the history of the development of Marxism can be divided into three stages.

In the latter half of the 19th century, Marx and Engels laid the foundation for the philosophy and theory of the proletarian revolution. In the famous "Communist Manifesto" and subsequent works, Marx and Engels provided the masses with Marxism and demonstrated the scientific prospects of Marxism.

The second stage is the period of Lenin. During the years of the First World War, Lenin became a great driving force in the development of Marxism. Under Lenin's leadership, the most significant event in human history occurred: the October Revolution in Russia. Lenin and Stalin, together, successfully applied Marx and Engels' theories both in theory and in practice. Later, Stalin inherited and consolidated Lenin's work, which is known as Leninism.

The article states that our era has entered the third stage of Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong analyzed the experiences and development of the dictatorship of the proletariat in socialist society, thereby pushing the theory and practice of scientific socialism to a new stage, which is the stage of Mao Zedong Thought.

The article points out that the world proletariat has witnessed the number one stronghold of the international communist movement, the Soviet Union, fall into the hands of traitors like Khrushchev who advocate revisionism.

In China, the influences and roots of capitalism are being uprooted, dealing a heavy blow to imperialism and its lackeys.

The article enthusiastically praises the Chinese revolutionary people for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing that Mao Zedong Thought concretely represents the interests of the proletariat and the oppressed peoples of all countries. Seriously studying Mao Zedong Thought can prevent socialist countries from changing color. Otherwise, they will regress, returning to capitalism and the old system of oppression and exploitation.

The article emphasizes that Mao Zedong has already played and is continuing to play a great historical role in the development of scientific socialism. He has proven that in countries where socialism has already been established, it is necessary to carry out a Cultural Revolution under the leadership of the proletariat, and this revolution will continue to develop as it deeply affects all aspects of life.

The article concludes by saying: Mao Zedong has creatively enriched the ideology and revolutionary practice of the proletariat, becoming the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, just as Marx and Engels were the outstanding representatives of scientific socialism in their era.

    新华社二日讯  荷兰左派刊物《共产党人》不久前登载一篇题为《毛泽东在发展科学社会主义方面的历史作用》的文章，热情赞扬毛主席对马克思列宁主义的发展所作出的巨大贡献。现将主要内容摘要如下：
    文章指出，马克思主义的发展历史可以分为三个阶段。
    在十九世纪后半期，马克思和恩格斯奠定了无产阶级革命哲学的基础和理论。在有名的《共产党宣言》里和以后的著作中，马克思和恩格斯向群众提供了马克思主义并展示出马克思主义的科学前景。
    第二个阶段是列宁的时期。在第一次世界大战的年代里，列宁成了发展马克思主义的巨大推动力。在列宁的领导下，发生了人类历史上最重大的事件：俄国十月革命。列宁和斯大林一起，不但在理论上，而且在实践上成功地运用了马克思和恩格斯的学说。斯大林后来继承和巩固了列宁的事业，即列宁主义。
    文章说，我们的时代进入了马克思列宁主义的第三个阶段。毛泽东分析了社会主义社会中，无产阶级专政的经验和发展，从而把科学社会主义的理论和实践推向新的阶段，这就是毛泽东思想的阶段。
    文章指出，世界无产阶级亲眼看到国际共产主义运动的头号堡垒苏联落入赫鲁晓夫之流叛徒的修正主义领导人手中。
    在中国，资本主义的影响及其萌芽正在被连根挖掉，这给帝国主义及其走狗以沉重的打击。
    文章热情赞扬中国革命人民活学活用毛泽东思想后，强调说，毛泽东思想具体地体现了无产阶级和各国被压迫人民的利益。认真学习毛泽东思想就能够防止社会主义国家改变颜色。否则，就会倒退，回到资本主义，回到压迫和剥削的旧制度。
    文章强调指出毛泽东在发展科学社会主义方面已经起的和正在起的伟大历史作用，他证明了，在已经建立了社会主义的国家，有必要在无产阶级领导下进行文化大革命，而这个革命将随着生活各个领域被深刻触动而继续发展。
    文章最后说：毛泽东创造性地丰富了无产阶级意识形态和革命实践，成为当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，正如马克思和恩格斯是他们时代的科学社会主义的杰出代表一样。
