The busy “Three Summers” must be managed with direction

When the battle of this year’s “Three Summers” was launched, the militia and poor and lower-middle peasants of Jiaoxie Commune in Hai'an County discussed the relationship between the busy “Three Summers” and the persistent study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, as well as the deepening of the revolutionary criticism and struggle.

Everyone said that in the past, whenever the busy season arrived, the local agents of the Chinese Khrushchev would spread rumors and stir up trouble, saying that studying Chairman Mao’s works could be done “less during busy times, not at all during the busiest times,” attempting to obstruct the revolutionary masses from studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. These guys talked about “agricultural standards” in meetings and focused on so-called “agricultural quality” in the fields. The busier the season, the more they promoted “material incentives” and “work points as the commander,” trying to lead the masses towards “self-interest.” Through discussion, everyone agreed that the busier the production season, the more important it is to do good ideological and political work. Only then can the busy season be managed with direction, and only then can the ideological line be clear and the production path be smooth.

In the discussion, everyone further studied Chairman Mao’s teachings on politics being the commander and the soul, and further understood that: during the busy agricultural season, people are needed to work. Wheat needs to be harvested by people, fertilizer needs to be accumulated by people, fields need to be plowed by people, seedlings need to be transplanted by people, and pests need to be controlled by people. People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest fighting force and the decisive factor in doing a good job during the “Three Summers.” Therefore, the most important thing, whether it is a thousand times or ten thousand times, is to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. The busier the season, the heavier the tasks and the tighter the time, the more contradictions there will be. The struggle between public and private interests, and the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines will be more intense. To resolve these contradictions, it is necessary to insist on highlighting proletarian politics and using Mao Zedong Thought to guide the “Three Summers.” Only by insisting on studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought during the busy season, and by carrying out revolutionary criticism and struggle, can we bring ideological and political work to the fields and courtyards, and implement it among the people. Only then can we complete the current summer harvest, summer planting, field management, and distribution work quickly and well.

After clarifying the ideology, in response to the characteristics of the busy season, cadres quickly went to the front lines of the “Three Summers,” reading Chairman Mao’s books with the poor and lower-middle peasants, engaging in revolutionary criticism and struggle together, eating, living, and working together, and leading the broad masses of militia members and commune members to advance the revolution and promote the “Three Summers.” At the same time, small, dispersed, and flexible methods were adopted to move the study of Chairman Mao’s works and revolutionary criticism and struggle to the fields, courtyards, and boat decks. Thus, the political atmosphere was thick, and the production enthusiasm was high. All the wheat fields were harvested as soon as they ripened. As soon as the wheat was out of the field, the cotton seedlings were immediately thinned, loosened, and fertilized, ensuring the healthy growth of the cotton seedlings.

### “三夏”大忙要忙得有方向

    “三夏”大忙要忙得有方向
    在今年“三夏”战斗打响时，我们海安县角斜公社的民兵和贫下中农着重讨论了“三夏”大忙同坚持活学活用毛泽东思想、深入开展革命大批判的关系问题。
    大家说，过去每到大忙季节，中国赫鲁晓夫在本地的代理人就煽阴风，点鬼火，说什么学习毛主席著作，可以“忙时少学，大忙不学”，企图阻挠革命群众活学活用毛泽东思想。这些家伙在会上谈的是“农活规格”，到田头抓的是所谓“农活质量”。他们越是在大忙季节越是千方百计地推行“物质刺激”、“工分挂帅”等黑货，硬把群众往“私”字上引。通过讨论，大家一致认为，越是生产大忙季节，越是要做好思想政治工作。这样，大忙才能忙得有方向，才能使思想上“纲”，生产上路。
    在讨论中，大家又学习了毛主席关于政治是统帅，是灵魂的教导，进一步认识到：农忙，要靠人去忙。麦要人割，肥要人积，田要人耕，秧要人栽，虫要人治。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是最大的战斗力，是搞好“三夏”的决定因素。因此，千重要，万重要，活学活用毛泽东思想最重要。越是大忙，越是任务重、时间紧，矛盾必然越多，公与私的斗争，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争也越激烈。要解决这些矛盾，就必须坚持突出无产阶级政治，坚持用毛泽东思想统帅“三夏”。只有在大忙中坚持活学活用毛泽东思想，坚持开展革命大批判，把思想政治工作做到田头、场头，落实到人，才能把当前的夏收、夏种、田间管理和分配等工作完成得又快又好。
    思想明确了以后，针对大忙的特点，干部纷纷深入到“三夏”第一线，与贫下中农同读毛主席的书，同搞革命大批判，同吃同住同劳动，带动广大民兵、社员抓革命，促“三夏”。同时采取小型、分散、灵活多样的方式，把学习毛主席著作和革命大批判的阵地移到田头、场头、船艄。从而，把政治空气搞得浓浓的，把生产干劲鼓得足足的。所有的麦田，做到熟一块收一块。麦子一离田，立即对棉苗进行了间苗、松土、施肥，保证棉苗茁壮生长。
