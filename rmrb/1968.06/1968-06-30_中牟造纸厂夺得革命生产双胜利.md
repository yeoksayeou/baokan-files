The revolutionary workers of Zhongmou Paper Mill in Henan, with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, under the assistance of the PLA's leftist support troops, smashed a small clique of class enemies' sabotage plots. They successfully trial-produced paper for printing the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and completed the second quarter's production tasks ahead of schedule.

Zhongmou Paper Mill is a key factory in Henan Province for producing paper for publishing Chairman Mao's works. After accepting the task of producing paper for the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in the first quarter this year, the broad masses of revolutionary cadres and workers have been working day and night to trial-produce the paper for printing the revolutionary treasure book as soon as possible. At this critical moment, a small clique of stubborn class enemies, directly plotted and instigated by a few die-hard capitalist-roaders within the factory, stirred up a wave of revisionist winds.

The revolutionary committee of the factory, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "never forget class struggle," organized the revolutionary workers of the entire factory to launch a fierce attack against the class enemies. They exposed a small clique of class enemies who were sabotaging the revolution and production, giving the broad revolutionary workers a profound lesson in class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. With boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, the revolutionary workers greatly carried forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to think and act, actively engaging in the battle to trial-produce paper for printing the revolutionary treasure book. After more than a month of arduous efforts, they finally successfully trial-produced the paper for printing the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and completed the second quarter's production tasks ahead of schedule.
