Albanian Party Newspaper Denounces the "Non-Proliferation Treaty" Concocted by the U.S. and the Soviet Union
The U.S. Imperialists and Soviet Revisionists' Nuclear Monopoly is Built on Sand

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, June 15th — The editorial of the Albanian newspaper "Voice of the People" on June 15th strongly denounced the so-called "Non-Proliferation Treaty" concocted by the U.S. and the Soviet Union.

The article pointed out that the so-called "Non-Proliferation Treaty" manipulated by the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists through the United Nations General Assembly is a new plot by the two superpowers against the sovereignty and interests of the peoples of various countries. It is another important link in the chain of their comprehensive cooperation within the framework of their hegemonic policy to dominate the world.

The article exposed that the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists were so enthusiastic about the "Non-Proliferation Treaty" because this treaty would become a tool for their counter-revolutionary and anti-China common conspiracy.

The article pointed out that the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists attempted to use the so-called "Non-Proliferation Treaty" to legalize their remaining nuclear monopoly, to ensure their superiority over non-nuclear weapon states, and to use it to threaten these countries and revolutionary peoples. They intended to use this treaty to shackle other countries.

The article said, "The main target of the creators of the 'Non-Proliferation Treaty' is the revolutionary peoples of various countries, first and foremost the People's Republic of China. The People's Republic of China, with its brave struggle for the freedom, independence, revolution, and socialism of the peoples of various countries, has become the main obstacle to the counter-revolutionary and neo-colonialist conspiracies of the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Washington and Moscow intend to use this infamous treaty to strengthen the 'encirclement' of People's China and, under the name of 'nuclear umbrella,' provide aid to China's neighboring countries such as India, so as to continue to blackmail and pressure the People's Republic of China. This is the calculation and plan of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists."

The article pointed out that, however, the plans of the enemies of the Chinese people are built on sand. The great People's China has already shattered the U.S.-Soviet nuclear monopoly. Today, People's China possesses all the necessary means, including atomic weapons, missiles, and hydrogen bombs, to retaliate against any aggressor who dares to invade. All peoples who hope for freedom and independence regard People's China as the strongest supporter of their aspirations and the most resolute fighter against the hegemonic plans of the two superpowers, the U.S. and the Soviet Union.

The article concluded by saying that the Albanian people denounce the so-called "Non-Proliferation Treaty" concocted by the U.S. and the Soviet Union. It is a big deception and new plot by the two superpowers against the freedom of the peoples of various countries. It is the blackmail and pressure exerted by the two superpowers to force sovereign states to accept their dictates.

    阿尔巴尼亚党报谴责美苏合伙炮制的“防止核扩散”黑条约
    美帝苏修的核垄断建立在沙滩上
    据新华社地拉那十五日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》十五日发表编辑部文章，强烈谴责美苏合伙炮制的所谓“防止核扩散”条约。
    文章指出，美帝国主义者和苏联修正主义者操纵联合国大会通过的所谓“防止核扩散”条约，是美苏反对各国人民的主权利益的新阴谋，是两个“超级大国”在主宰世界的霸权政策范围内进行全面合作的锁链上的又一个重要环节。
    文章揭露说，美帝国主义者和苏联修正主义者对“防止核扩散”条约所以拍手叫好，是因为这个条约将成为苏美推行其反人民和反华的反革命共同阴谋的工具。
    文章指出，美帝国主义者和苏联修正主义者企图通过所谓“防止核扩散”条约，使他们残存的核垄断合法化，以保障他们凌驾于无原子武器国家之上的地位，并用它来威胁这些国家和革命人民。他们企图用这个条约来束缚其他国家的手脚。
    文章说，“防止核扩散”条约的炮制者的主要目标是针对各国革命人民，首先是针对中华人民共和国。中华人民共和国以其有利于各国人民的自由、独立、革命和社会主义的勇敢的斗争，成了美苏推行反革命和新殖民主义阴谋的主要障碍。华盛顿和莫斯科企图通过这个臭名昭著的条约来加强对人民中国的“包围圈”，并在“核保护伞”的名义下给中国的邻国如印度以援助，以便继续对中华人民共和国进行讹诈，施加压力。这就是美帝国主义者和苏联修正主义者的算盘和计划。
    文章指出，但是，中国人民的敌人的这些计划是建筑在沙滩上的。伟大的人民中国已经粉碎了美苏核垄断。人民中国今天拥有原子武器、导弹和氢弹等一切必要手段来回击任何敢于侵犯她的侵略者。一切希望自由和独立生活的人民，把人民中国看作是他们的愿望的最强有力的支持者，看作是反对美苏两大国霸权计划的最坚决的战士。
    文章最后说，阿尔巴尼亚人民谴责美苏炮制的所谓“防止核扩散”条约，它是美苏反对各国人民的自由的大骗局和新阴谋，它是两大国强迫主权国家接受他们的意旨所进行的讹诈和施加的压力。
