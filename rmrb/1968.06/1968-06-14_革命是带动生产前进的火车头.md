The revolutionary and production situation on the industrial and transportation front in Harbin is excellent. Over 90% of factories and enterprises in the city have established revolutionary committees. The industrial production level in May was 20% higher than in April, with the output of 44 types of products significantly increasing. The output of major products such as industrial bearings has increased by over 50%.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, June 13th — The industrial and transportation front in Harbin presents a very good situation, with the revolution booming and production rising month by month. Broad masses of revolutionary workers and cadres are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, fiercely grasping class struggle, deeply and persistently carrying out the great criticism of the revolution, launching a fierce attack on class enemies. They are holding high the banner of the revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought, fiercely criticizing the series of counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods promoted by Chinese Khrushchev, and in conjunction with the class struggle realities of their own units, fiercely criticizing and struggle against a small handful of unrepentant capitalist roaders, smashing the rightist reversal wind, and at the same time, exposing a small handful of traitors, spies, and other counter-revolutionaries hidden within the enterprises.

The victory in the struggle against the enemy has greatly promoted the consolidation and development of revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. Now, over 90% of factories and enterprises in the city have established revolutionary committees.

Revolution is the locomotive driving production forward. The excellent revolutionary situation has powerfully promoted the development of production, with industrial production in the city rising month by month and the situation becoming better and better. In May, the industrial production level in the city was 20% higher than in April. The output of 44 types of products has significantly increased compared to April; the output of major products such as industrial bearings, water turbine generators, forty-eight-row seeders, fertilizers, and light bulbs has increased by over 50%.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its led broad revolutionary masses and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." The broad revolutionary workers in Harbin have repeatedly studied and deeply understood Chairman Mao's great instruction, with high fighting spirit, actively launching a fierce attack on class enemies. They have set up revolutionary criticism battlefields in the workshops, offices, construction sites, and staff dormitories of factories, raised their awareness of class struggle and line struggle, greatly stimulated revolutionary and production enthusiasm, and promoted the great development of production. The revolutionary workers of the Harbin Electric Machinery Factory, in conjunction with the class struggle realities of their own factory, fiercely criticized Chinese Khrushchev's advocacy of the theory of "extinction of class struggle," fiercely struck down the plots and tricks of class enemies attempting to sabotage the revolution and production, and promoted the leap in production. In May, they completed the production of the state's key product, a 25,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator set, 14 days ahead of schedule. The forging and retaining frame of two key workshops in the Harbin Bearing Factory, due to being controlled by a small handful of capitalist roaders and bad elements in the factory, had poor production conditions. Later, revolutionary workers, in conjunction with the great criticism of the revolution, deeply exposed and criticized the reversal wind of class enemies, exposed the bad elements hidden in these units, and the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses was fully mobilized. In May, the output of bearings in the entire factory increased by 50% compared to April, and the production plan was completed one day ahead of schedule.

    革命是带动生产前进的火车头
    哈尔滨市工交战线革命和生产形势一片大好。全市百分之九十以上工厂企业已建立革委会；五月份工业生产水平比四月份提高百分之二十，四十四种产品产量显著增长，工业轴承等主要产品的产量增长幅度都在百分之五十以上
    新华社哈尔滨十三日电　哈尔滨市工业交通战线呈现一派大好形势，革命轰轰烈烈，生产逐月上升。广大革命职工和革命干部高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席最新指示，狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，向阶级敌人发起了猛烈进攻。他们高举毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，痛批了中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的一系列反革命修正主义黑货，并且结合本单位阶级斗争实际，狠狠批斗一小撮死不悔改的走资派，粉碎右倾翻案妖风，同时挖出了隐藏在企业内部的一小撮叛徒、特务和其他反革命分子。
    对敌斗争的胜利发展，大大促进了革命大联合、革命三结合的巩固发展。现在，全市百分之九十以上的工厂企业已建立革委会。
    革命是带动生产前进的火车头。革命大好形势有力地促进了生产的发展，全市工业生产逐月上升，形势越来越好。五月份，全市工业生产水平比四月份提高百分之二十。有四十四种产品的产量比四月份显著增长；工业轴承、水轮发电机、四十八行播种机、化肥和灯泡等主要产品，产量增长幅度都在百分之五十以上。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”哈尔滨市的广大革命职工反复学习、深刻领会毛主席这一伟大指示，以高昂的战斗精神，主动地向阶级敌人发起了猛烈进攻。他们在工厂的车间、科室、工地和家属宿舍，到处摆开了革命大批判的战场，提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，极大地激发了革命和生产积极性，促进了生产的大发展。哈尔滨电机厂革命职工结合本厂阶级斗争实际，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，狠狠打击了阶级敌人妄图破坏革命和生产的阴谋诡计，促进了生产的跃进，五月份提前十四天胜利完成了国家重点产品两万五千瓩汽轮发电机组的生产任务。哈尔滨轴承厂的锻压和保持架两个关键车间的部分关键工序，由于一度被厂内走资派和一小撮坏家伙控制，生产情况一直不好。后来，革命职工结合革命大批判，深入揭发和批判了阶级敌人的翻案妖风，挖出了隐藏在这些单位的坏人，群众的革命积极性得到充分发挥，五月份全厂轴承产量比四月份提高百分之五十，提前一天完成了生产计划。
