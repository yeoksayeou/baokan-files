With boundless love and loyalty to our great leader Chairman Mao, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Shaanxi Province have launched a high tide of enthusiastically selling patriotic grain in the midst of the triumphant songs of this summer's bumper harvest. They are striving to complete and overfulfill the summer grain procurement task quickly and well, and to support the nation's socialist revolution and construction with practical actions.

Currently, on the roads leading to the county and commune grain stations, the queues of people selling patriotic grain are endless. People are holding high red flags, carrying portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao, and singing lively revolutionary songs as they hand over the best grain to the state. In the eastern part of Shaanxi, where summer crops are harvested earlier, counties such as Tongguan, Huaxian, Lintong, Pucheng, Hancheng, and Lantian have many production teams of poor and lower-middle peasants who, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," have already completed and overfulfilled the summer grain procurement task ahead of schedule.

In the summer grain procurement work, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in various parts of Shaanxi Province have firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle." They have focused on class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and have severely criticized the revisionist line pursued by Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the grain work in this region. The poor and lower-middle peasants are determined to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, with a heart for the motherland and an eye on the world, to see the big picture and consider the whole, to sell more surplus grain to the state, and to resolutely walk the broad avenue of socialism. The Party Family Brigade of Lianhua Temple Commune in Huaxian has quickly sold over 40,000 jin of summer grain to the state, overfulfilling the annual grain procurement task.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Hefei on the 22nd, the old disaster area of Huaibei in Anhui Province, which has long relied on state grain supplies, has achieved a bumper harvest of summer crops this year and has taken the lead in overfulfilling the summer grain procurement task. The time for grain to enter the state granaries is more than a month earlier than the same period last year.

The Fuyang Region is located in the Huaibei Plain, a place known for "big rains bring big disasters, small rains bring small disasters, and no rain brings drought disasters." Every year, it has to rely on state grain supplies. This year, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members throughout the region have resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." They have always insisted on emphasizing proletarian politics, using revolution to lead production, overcoming drought and pests, and achieving a bumper harvest. The wheat yield has increased significantly compared to last year, and each production team in the region has surplus grain.

To do a good job in the "three summers" work, the region, county, and commune have held Mao Zedong Thought study classes at all levels. These study classes systematically studied Chairman Mao's instructions on "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people," "grain must be grasped tightly," and correctly handling the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members have greatly raised their class consciousness, promoted the revolutionization of their thinking, and launched a high tide of selling grain to the state. Many production teams have overfulfilled the annual procurement task in one season.

    用实际行动支援国家的社会主义革命和社会主义建设
    陕西掀起踊跃交售夏粮热潮
    淮北老灾区阜阳专区超额完成夏粮征购任务
    据新华社西安二十二日电　陕西省广大贫下中农，怀着对我们伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱和忠诚，在今年夏收作物普遍获得丰收的凯歌声中，掀起踊跃交售爱国粮的高潮，力争又快又好地完成和超额完成夏粮征购任务，以实际行动支援国家的社会主义革命和社会主义建设。
    目前，在通往县、社粮站的大路上，交售爱国粮的队伍络绎不绝。人们高举红旗，手捧伟大领袖毛主席的画像，唱着嘹亮的革命歌曲，把最好的粮食交售给国家。夏收作物收割较早的陕西东部地区的潼关、华县、临潼、蒲城、韩城、蓝田等县许多社队的贫下中农，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，已经提前完成和超额完成了夏粮的征购任务。
    陕西省各地广大贫下中农在夏粮征购工作中，牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线的斗争，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本地区的代理人在粮食工作中推行的修正主义路线。贫下中农决心遵照毛主席的教导，胸怀祖国，放眼世界，识大局，顾整体，多卖余粮给国家，坚决走社会主义的康庄大道。华县莲花寺公社党家何大队很快向国家交售夏粮四万多斤，超额完成了全年粮食征购任务。
    据新华社合肥二十二日电　一向依靠国家供应粮食的安徽淮北老灾区阜阳专区今年夏熟作物获得丰收，一马当先超额完成了夏粮征购任务。全区粮食入库的时间比去年同期提前一个多月。
    阜阳专区位于淮北平原，历史上是个“大雨大灾，小雨小灾，无雨旱灾”的地方，每年都要国家供应粮食。今年，全专区广大贫下中农和社员群众坚决贯彻执行毛主席
  “抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，始终坚持突出无产阶级政治，以革命统帅生产，战胜了干旱和虫害，夺得了丰收。小麦产量比去年有较大幅度的增产，全区各生产队有了余粮。
    为了做好“三夏”工作，专区、县和公社层层举办毛泽东思想学习班。这些学习班系统地学习了毛主席关于“备战、备荒、为人民”、“必须把粮食抓紧”以及正确处理国家、集体、个人三者关系的指示。广大贫下中农和社员群众大大提高了阶级觉悟，促进了思想革命化，掀起了向国家交售粮食的高潮。许多生产队一季就超额完成了全年的征购任务。
