Our great teacher, great leader Chairman Mao lives forever!

On June 4, 1968, Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, received more than twenty thousand People's Liberation Army soldiers and officers. This is the greatest care and encouragement for all the military and civilian people of the nation. Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, both new and old revolutionary soldiers are determined to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment closely, and to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions. In the struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they will create new merits.

	Millions of red hearts turn towards Chairman Mao, and millions of smiling faces welcome the red sun. Revolutionary soldiers hold high the red revolutionary treasure book, "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and shout in millions of voices: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!"
