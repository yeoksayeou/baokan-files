The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: “The most fundamental aspect of reforming state organs is to connect with the masses.” One of the prominent features of the newly established revolutionary committees is that they are deeply rooted among the masses.

Some of the main leaders of the Revolutionary Committee of Yutian County, Hebei Province, have firmly remembered Chairman Mao’s teachings, consciously transformed their worldviews, and established the good style of maintaining close ties with the masses.

The essence of poor and lower-middle peasants must not change.

Comrade Bai Yulan, the deputy director of the county revolutionary committee, is a young intellectual who responded to the party’s call in 1962 to return to her hometown from the transportation front. After returning to her hometown, this daughter of a poor peasant worked hard to study and apply Chairman Mao’s works, actively participated in collective labor, and always got along well with the community members. During the Cultural Revolution, she led the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in her village to rebel against Chinese Khrushchev and his agents. The old poor peasants in the village praised her as a “good daughter of the poor and lower-middle peasants.”

Their village is more than sixty miles away from the county seat, and Bai Yulan does not know how to ride a bicycle. Therefore, when the county revolutionary committee holds a standing committee meeting, a small car is sent to pick her up. The first time the small car came, Bai Yulan felt very uncomfortable sitting in it. But later, she thought: This is a work necessity! Her mind became a bit more at ease.

After a period of time, the county revolutionary committee opened its doors for rectification. Bai Yulan studied Chairman Mao’s teaching of “being both an official and a common person,” and her thoughts were in intense struggle: From walking all the time to being picked up and dropped off by a car, from being uncomfortable to getting used to it, this shows that after becoming a deputy director, her thoughts have changed. She had a bit more of an official air, and her feelings for the masses would become a bit more distant. If this continued, she would go from being a representative of the masses to becoming a “lord” of the masses, making herself “empty” and losing her representativeness. The more she thought about it, the more dangerous it seemed. She decided to do the following: Her position may change, but her thoughts must not change, and the essence of a poor and lower-middle peasant must not change! She must always listen to Chairman Mao’s words, maintain close ties with the masses, and forever preserve her revolutionary youth.

From then on, whenever the county revolutionary committee held a standing committee meeting, except for the opportunity to hitch a ride on passing transport trucks, she would walk back and forth. After each meeting ended, no matter how early or late it was, or how good or bad the weather was, she would set off for the team. There were a few times when she returned home in the middle of the night. After arriving home, as long as the community members had not finished work, she would put down her luggage and immediately participate in collective labor. While working, someone teased her, saying, “Yulan, you, the deputy director of the county revolutionary committee, are also so fond of labor?” Bai Yulan continued to work without stopping and replied, “Only by being fond of labor can one not become detached from the masses. Even if one does this, one is still far from being ‘completely’ and ‘thoroughly’ dedicated!”

Bai Yulan’s position changed, but her essence as a poor and lower-middle peasant did not. She always thinks about the masses and devotes her heart to the collective. She always appears among the masses as an ordinary laborer, participating in labor with everyone, studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works together, attending Mao Zedong Thought study classes together, fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism together, and jointly caring about state affairs. She is heart-to-heart with the masses, and she understands the masses’ concerns the most and reflects their opinions in a timely manner. The masses all call her a “close friend” and a “good representative” in the revolutionary committee.

### 贫下中农的本色不能变

专栏：革命委员会好

    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”新生的革命委员会的显著特点之一，就在于它深深扎根于群众之中。
    河北省玉田县革命委员会的一些主要领导成员，牢记毛主席的教导，自觉地改造世界观，树立密切联系群众的好作风。
    贫下中农的本色不能变
    县革命委员会副主任柏玉兰同志，是一九六二年响应党的号召，从交通战线返乡的知识青年。这个贫农的女儿回到家乡以后，努力活学活用毛主席著作，积极参加集体劳动，处处和社员打成一片。在文化大革命运动中，她带动村里的广大贫下中农，造了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的反。村上的老贫农都夸她是“贫下中农的好闺女”。
    他们村离县城六十多里路，柏玉兰又不会骑自行车，所以县革命委员会开常委会，就用小汽车来接她。第一次来小汽车，柏玉兰坐着觉得很不得劲。可是，后来一想：这是工作需要嘛！心里就有点“踏实”了。
    过了一段时间，县革命委员会开门整风。柏玉兰学习了毛主席“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的教导，思想斗争很激烈：从经常徒步到小汽车接小汽车送，从坐不惯到坐得惯，这说明自己当了副主任以后，思想上发生了变化。身上多了一份“官气”，和群众的感情就会淡薄一层。如果发展下去，就会由群众的代表，变成群众的“老爷”，把自己“架空”，失去代表性。越想越觉得危险，她下决心要做到：地位变了，思想不能变，贫下中农的本色不能变！要永远听毛主席的话，密切联系群众，永葆革命的青春。
    从此，每逢县革命委员会开常委会，除了有机会搭乘过往的运输卡车外，她就徒步往返。每次会议结束，不管时间早晚，天气好坏，她都是拔腿就往队里赶。有几次，是连夜赶回去的。到家以后，只要社员还没收工，她放下行李，就立即参加集体劳动。在劳动的时候，有的人逗她说：“玉兰呀，你这个堂堂的县革委会副主任，也这么迷劳动？”柏玉兰一面不停手地干活，一面回答：“只有迷劳动，才能不脱离群众。就是照这样干，离‘完全’、‘彻底’还差一大截哩！”
    柏玉兰的地位变了，可是她的贫下中农的本色没有变。她事事挂记着群众，一条心扑向集体。她处处以一个普通劳动者的姿态出现在群众中间，跟大家一块参加劳动，一块活学活用毛主席著作，一块参加毛泽东思想学习班，一块斗私批修，共同关心国家大事。她和群众心连心，群众的心事她最摸底，群众的意见她反映得很及时。群众都称她是“贴心人”、“革命委员会里的好代表”。
