According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated May 31, Singapore news: The Malayan newspaper "Frontline News," published in Singapore, published an editorial on May 26 stating that the recent massive popular revolutionary movements that have erupted in France, Europe, and North America are ferociously shaking the reactionary rule of the monopoly bourgeoisie and have shaken the entire capitalist world.

The editorial said, "Our great teacher, Chairman Mao, teaches us: 'Where there is oppression, there is resistance.' The recent surge in workers' and students' movements in France and other countries in Europe and North America reflects the intensification of class contradictions within these countries. The capitalist countries, led by U.S. imperialism, are currently facing a serious political and economic crisis. The monopoly bourgeoisie, in order to save their faltering rule, are constantly intensifying their exploitation and oppression of the people, which inevitably provokes stronger resistance from the people.

The editorial pointed out that the revolutionary struggle launched by French workers and students marks a new awakening of the French people and is a continuation of the Paris Commune revolutionary tradition.

The editorial said, "The development of the French people's revolutionary movement will greatly inspire and support the struggles of the people of all countries in the world. It directly strikes at the rule of capitalism, deepens the political and economic crises of capitalist countries, and accelerates the comprehensive collapse of imperialism.

The editorial said, "The thriving revolutionary struggles of the people in France, Europe, and North America are inseparable from the influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has promoted the widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought.

The editorial pointed out, "People are increasingly seeing that the invincible Mao Zedong Thought enjoys high prestige and influence among the revolutionary people of the world."

    马来亚《阵线报》发表社论指出
    法国和欧洲、北美人民革命斗争蓬勃发展
    猛烈地冲击着垄断资产阶级的反动统治
    据新华社三十一日讯　新加坡消息：在新加坡出版的马来亚报纸《阵线报》二十六日发表社论指出，法国和欧洲、北美最近爆发的波澜壮阔的群众革命运动，极其猛烈地冲击着垄断资产阶级的反动统治，震撼了整个资本主义世界。
    社论说，世界革命人民的伟大导师毛主席教导我们：“哪里有压迫，哪里就有反抗。”法国和欧洲、北美其他国家的工人和学生运动的新高涨，反映了这些国家内阶级矛盾的激化。以美帝国主义为首的资本主义国家，目前正面临一场严重的政治和经济危机，垄断资产阶级为了挽救它们垂危的统治，不断地加紧对人民的剥削和压迫，这就不可避免地要激起人民的更强烈的反抗。
    社论指出，法国工人和学生掀起的这场革命斗争，标志着法国人民的新的觉醒，它是巴黎公社革命传统的继续。
    社论说，法国人民革命运动的发展，必将给全世界各国人民的斗争以巨大的鼓舞和支援。它直接打击了资本主义的统治，加深了资本主义国家的政治和经济危机，加速了帝国主义走向全面崩溃。
    社论说，法国和欧洲、北美人民革命斗争的蓬勃发展，是和中国无产阶级文化大革命的影响分不开的。中国无产阶级文化大革命促进了毛泽东思想的广泛传播。
    社论指出，人们越来越清楚地看到，战无不胜的毛泽东思想在世界革命人民当中的崇高威望和影响。
