Indian reactionary government premier actively works to cobble together an anti-China alliance for the US and the Soviet revisionists

	Indira Gandhi, under the guise of "economic cooperation," travels to Australia and New Zealand to engage in conspiracy activities

	New Delhi, June 7, Xinhua -- Indian reactionary government premier Indira Gandhi recently visited Australia, New Zealand, and Malaya (including Singapore) for half a month, actively working to cobble together an anti-China alliance for the US imperialists and Soviet revisionists.

	During the tenure of former Indian premier Nehru, the Indian reactionary government put on a false facade of "non-alignment," claiming not to want any involvement with military alliances or aligned countries. Now, the Indira Gandhi government has cast aside this mask and is hastily colluding with US imperialist lackeys and puppets like Australia and New Zealand, attempting to cobble together a new anti-China alliance according to the wishes of the US imperialists and Soviet revisionists. This reflects their great fear and anxiety over the heavy defeats suffered by imperialist forces in Southeast Asia and the surging people's revolutionary struggles.

	Due to the extremely bad reputation of the military aggression group controlled by the US -- the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) -- which has already fallen apart, the Indian reactionaries have to carry out their efforts to cobble together an anti-China alliance under the guise of "economic cooperation." In this activity, Indira Gandhi, while slandering China, has been vigorously advocating for "regional cooperation in Asia," calling for the countries of Southeast Asia and Australia to "unite, help each other, and become economically prosperous" to counter the so-called "Chinese threat."

	The Indian reactionary government even harbors the ambition to become the leader of the anti-China alliance in Southeast Asia and Australia, so as to more fervently serve the US imperialists and use this to carry out economic expansion in these regions. Indira Gandhi, wherever she goes, sings the praises of India as a "great power" that should "play a greater role" in Southeast Asia. She said, "India opposes any external great power filling the vacuum left by the withdrawal of British troops from the Far East." This actually means that the "vacuum" should be filled by India, this "great power." She also expressed that although India is poor, it can "provide technical and economic aid" to the countries of Southeast Asia. This is actually about exporting capital to Southeast Asia and carrying out economic infiltration.

	In the face of the thriving revolutionary struggles of the people in Southeast Asia, the US imperialists and their various lackeys and running dogs are riddled with contradictions and each harbors their own schemes. Therefore, despite Indira Gandhi's considerable efforts, the results have been meager. About a year ago, the Indian reactionaries publicly proposed the idea of establishing a so-called "Asian Common Market," which received little response. This time, Indira Gandhi lowered her tune to "signing a trade agreement for the Southeast Asia region" and establishing "regional economic cooperation," but she did not achieve her wishes.

	Even the reactionary rulers of Southeast Asia and Australia have seen that the Indian reactionary government is continuing to beg for "aid" from the US imperialists and Soviet revisionists, and is in a very difficult situation. It is attempting to export goods and capital abroad to relieve its economic difficulties. When in Australia, Indira Gandhi shamelessly boasted that India would achieve grain self-sufficiency within a few years, but at the same time privately requested the Australian government to supply wheat. Therefore, according to reports from Indian bourgeois newspapers, the Australian premier expressed doubt over whether the Indian government could truly make the "contributions" it should in Southeast Asia.

	No matter who the US imperialists and Soviet revisionists instruct or what conspiracies and tricks they use to cobble together an anti-China alliance and encircle China, it is all in vain. The Chinese people are forever unencircled. On the contrary, the US imperialists and their lackeys have already fallen into the encirclement of the revolutionary peoples of the world.

    “不结盟”的假面具干脆抛开　帮凶者的真面目彻底暴露
    印反动政府总理为美苏拼凑反华联盟奔走效劳
    英迪拉·甘地打着“经济合作”幌子到澳大利亚和新西兰等地大搞阴谋活动
    新华社七日讯　印度反动政府总理英迪拉·甘地最近到澳大利亚、新西兰和马来亚（包括新加坡）等地奔走了半个月，积极为美帝、苏修拼凑反华联盟的罪恶勾当效劳。
    在印度前总理尼赫鲁执政期间，印度反动政府装出一副“不结盟”的虚伪姿态，表示不愿意同军事联盟和结盟国家有瓜葛。现在，英迪拉·甘地政府干脆抛掉这个假面具，加紧勾结澳大利亚、新西兰等同美国建立军事同盟的美帝帮凶和仆从，妄图按照美帝、苏修的意旨拼凑一个新的反华联盟。这反映出它们对帝国主义势力在东南亚地区的惨重失败和人民革命斗争的高涨，十分恐慌不安。
    由于美帝控制的军事侵略集团——东南亚条约组织，名声太臭，而且已经分崩离析，印度反动派拼凑反华联盟，不得不在“经济合作”的伪装下进行。英迪拉·甘地在这次活动中，在大肆诽谤中国的同时，竭力鼓吹“实行亚洲区域合作”，叫嚷要东南亚和澳洲国家“联合起来，互相帮助，在经济上变得富强”，来对付所谓“中国的威胁”。
    印度反动政府甚至一心想当东南亚和澳洲地区反华联盟的盟主，以便更卖力地为美帝效劳，并借此向这些地区实行经济扩张。英迪拉·甘地在所到之处，高唱什么印度是“大国”，应当在东南亚地区“发挥更大的作用”。她说：“印度反对任何外面的大国填补英国军队撤出远东后留下的真空。”这实际上是说，“真空”要由印度这个“大国”来填补。她还表示，印度虽然穷，但可以向东南亚国家“提供技术经济援助”。这实际上就是向东南亚国家输出资本，进行经济渗透。
    在东南亚地区人民革命斗争蓬勃发展的形势下，美帝及其各帮凶走卒之间矛盾重重，各怀鬼胎。因此，尽管英迪拉·甘地卖了不小的力气，但是收效甚微。大约一年前，印度反动派就公开提出建立所谓“亚洲共同市场”主张，没有得到什么响应。英迪拉·甘地这回把调子降低到“签订一个东南亚地区的贸易条约”，建立“地区性经济合作”，也没能如愿以偿。
    连东南亚和澳洲的反动统治者也看出，印度反动政府在继续向美帝和苏修乞讨“援助”，日子很不好过，它企图向国外输出商品和资本来解救自己的经济困难。英迪拉·甘地在澳大利亚时，厚着脸皮吹牛说印度将在几年以内做到粮食自给，但同时却又私下向澳大利亚政府要求供应小麦。因此，据印度资产阶级报纸透露，澳大利亚总理表示怀疑印度政府是否真的能够在东南亚作出它“应有的贡献”。
    美帝和苏修不论指使什么人，用什么阴谋诡计来拼凑反华联盟，包围中国，都是枉费心机的。中国人民是永远包围不住的。相反，美帝及其帮凶们却已陷入全世界革命人民的重重包围之中。
