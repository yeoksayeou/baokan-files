On October 9, 1967, ten young revolutionaries stood side by side on the Golden Water Bridge in front of Tiananmen Square in the capital, facing the portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, solemnly swearing: "We will forever be loyal to you, forever loyal to your invincible great thoughts, forever loyal to your proletarian revolutionary line. On the bright path you have shown us, we will forever march forward! Forward!"

On this very day, these ten young revolutionaries, carrying Chairman Mao's revolutionary books, left Beijing with revolutionary fervor and headed for the vast grasslands of Xilingol in Inner Mongolia.

The growth of these ten young revolutionaries on the grasslands of Inner Mongolia is a microcosm of the growth process of Beijing's intellectual youth who have settled in Inner Mongolia.

These ten young revolutionaries, following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, decided to take the path of integrating with workers and peasants. They came from the capital to the distant frontier, from the big city to the vast grasslands, what a great change this was for them!

When they first arrived at Baiyinbaolige Brigade in Xiujimuqinqi Banner, they found it difficult to adapt to the new environment, the language was unfamiliar, and there were many things they did not understand. Everything had to be learned from scratch. How to deal with so many difficulties? They, as always, turned to Chairman Mao's works for guidance. Chairman Mao taught: "What is work? Work is struggle. Where there are difficulties and problems, we need to go and solve them. We work and struggle to overcome difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go, this is what a good comrade should do." Chairman Mao's teachings greatly encouraged them. They said, they would not be intimidated by difficulties and must overcome them! They forced themselves to eat meat and drink tea; they insisted on learning to ride horses; they studied hard to learn what they did not know.

Practice has proven that issues related to living habits are relatively easy to solve. For them, the biggest test was whether they could maintain a firm and correct political direction, whether they could be united with the poor herdsmen, and whether they could fundamentally transform their worldview.

These ten young revolutionaries included both men and women. When they first arrived, the production team, in consideration of them, arranged for the male and female youth to live separately. They thought: If we stay in our own little group all day, with little contact with the poor herdsmen, how can we talk about integrating with workers and peasants, how can we talk about transforming our worldview, how can we talk about serving the people? So, they repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's works, further realizing that whether or not to go among the poor herdsmen and blend in with them was the dividing line between loyalty and disloyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Only by sharing joys and sorrows with the poor herdsmen, preventing special treatment in life, could they cultivate the excellent qualities of the working people, develop a spirit of hard struggle, and have the possibility of fundamentally transforming their worldview. They decided to step out of their small world of ten people, step out of the separate yurts, and move into the homes of the poor herdsmen.

The poor herdsmen on the grasslands treated these young people from Beijing as their own children and siblings, caring for their growth in every way. Some elderly people believed that these children should not forget class struggle, often introducing the brigade's class and class struggle situation to them, telling them their own stories of oppression and exploitation in the old society, giving them a deep class education. Especially, the poor herdsmen's boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao deeply moved these young people. When they arrived, the herdsmen's first words to them were: "Long live Chairman Mao!" They saw that many herdsmen's toddlers learned their first words as "Long live Chairman Mao!" and their first song as "The East Is Red." Some people repeatedly invited these Red Guards who had been near Chairman Mao to share their experiences of seeing the great leader. Some taught them to sing songs in Mongolian like "Long Live Chairman Mao!" and "Determination." The herdsmen lived scattered, but every evening when the Mao Zedong Thought study classes were held, the yurts were always full. No matter how tired they were from work, how cold the weather was, how dark the night was, how far the distance was, everyone would rush to study without drinking tea or eating. For example, the old mother of Jirentai's family always participated in every study session. She said: "I will learn Chairman Mao's works until I die." All this was a great education and encouragement to these young people who had just come to the pastoral area. They all secretly made a resolution to learn from the poor herdsmen.

Last winter, the snow was heavy and the weather was cold. At night, some poor herdsmen used their own felt and blankets to block the wind for the collective livestock. In the cold night, if some sheep froze, the herdsmen would bring them into the yurt to drink water and feed. When Haotao Tege was selecting the old and weak sheep from the flock to send to the warm shed to feed on hay, the intellectual youth Wang Jingzhi noticed that there was still a very thin sheep that had not been selected, and said: "Grandpa, select this one too, otherwise it will freeze to death." Unexpectedly, Haotao Tege looked at it and said: "It's okay, this is our private livestock, we'll deal with it later, but we can't delay the collective sheep!" Haotao Tege's selfless and noble qualities greatly educated her.

Once, the intellectual youth Hu Zhijian went out to herd sheep, feeling both cold and thirsty. At first, he insisted on not going home to drink tea. He thought: If I leave the flock, the sheep will run far, and if something happens, I will let the people down. Later, when he was really thirsty, he ran back home to drink tea. As soon as he picked up the tea bowl, he felt uncomfortable. He quickly put down the bowl and went out to see that the flock had already run far away. After he drove the flock back, he opened "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and compared Norman Bethune's spirit of extreme responsibility for work and the old herdsmen's selfless thoughts with his own, feeling very ashamed. From then on, no matter how cold, hungry, or thirsty he was, he insisted on herding the flock.

Now, many of them have become respected "shepherds" on the grasslands. Ninghua always goes out to herd sheep on foot, and has to cross mountains and valleys, which is very tiring, but he never complains. Once, he got lost while herding sheep, but he followed the flock without leaving it. At that time, he had only one thought: I must not lose a single sheep of the collective. In the flock he was herding, there were three or four sheep that could not walk, so he carried them back one by one.

Usually, they all compete to do good deeds for the poor herdsmen, whatever the poor herdsmen need, they do it and help. Once, Wang Jingzhi helped the brigade's militia platoon leader and team secretary Jirentai's family dig frozen sheep dung, Jirentai was afraid she would be tired and did not want her to do it, Wang Jingzhi seriously said: "I am not a herdsman, we did not come here to enjoy life. Chairman Mao taught us: 'The more difficult the place, the more we should go, this is what a good comrade should do,' we revolutionary youth should be like this!" After saying this, she picked up the pickaxe and started working hard.

The Baiyinbaolige Brigade is far from the hospital, making it inconvenient for herdsmen to see a doctor. The young revolutionaries saw this situation and decided to let Jin Kun learn to be a medical worker. Jin Kun decided to serve the herdsmen and studied hard. She learned quickly and can now treat common illnesses, and is very popular with the herdsmen.

Chairman Mao taught us: "Intellectuals, if they do not integrate with the workers and peasants, will achieve nothing." These Red Guards who had fought resolutely against the capitalist reactionary line promoted by China's Khrushchev, all expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, take the path of integrating with the workers and peasants, and not be "half-revolutionaries." They will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, closely follow Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and go to the battlefield of the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation to get dirty and oily, and temper themselves into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

"Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Although these ten intellectual youth from Beijing have only been on the grasslands of Inner Mongolia for a short few months, they have overcome numerous difficulties, taken root on the grasslands, and taken solid steps on the revolutionary path of integrating with the workers and peasants. Under the sun of the red sun, they are growing vigorously on the grasslands of Inner Mongolia.

    北京的红卫兵  草原上的新牧民
    ——记在内蒙古锡林郭勒草原上落户的北京知识青年
    一九六七年十月九日，在首都天安门前金水桥上，有十位革命小将并肩站立，面对着伟大领袖毛主席的画像庄严宣誓：我们永远忠于您，永远忠于您的战无不胜的伟大思想，永远忠于您的无产阶级革命路线。在您指引的光辉大道上，我们永远向前！向前！
    就在这一天，这十位革命小将带上毛主席的革命宝书，满怀革命豪情，离开首都北京，奔赴内蒙古锡林郭勒大草原。
    这十位革命小将在内蒙古草原上的成长过程，是北京到内蒙古草原安家落户的知识青年成长过程的一个缩影。
    这十位革命小将，遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，决心走和工农相结合的道路。他们从首都来到遥远的边疆，从大城市来到辽阔的草原，这对他们来说是多么大的变化啊！
    他们刚刚来到西乌珠穆沁旗白音宝力格公社白音宝力格大队时，生活不习惯，语言不通，有许多事情不懂，一切都得从头学起。困难多怎么办？他们一如既往，有了问题就向毛主席著作请教。毛主席教导说：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”毛主席的教导给了他们极大的鼓舞。他们说，绝不能被困难所吓倒，一定要战胜它！不习惯吃肉、喝茶，就强吃强喝；不会骑马，就硬练硬骑；不懂得的事情，就抓紧学习。
    实践证明，生活习惯上的问题毕竟是容易解决的。对他们来说，最大的考验是能不能永远保持坚定正确的政治方向，能不能和贫苦牧民一条心，能不能使自己的世界观得到根本的改造。
    这十名革命小将有男有女。他们初来这里，生产队为了照顾他们，让男青年和女青年分别集中住在一起。他们想：成天在自己这十个人的圈子里打转转，和贫苦牧民们很少接触，还谈什么和工农相结合，谈什么世界观的改造，谈什么为人民服务？于是，他们带着这些问题反复学习了毛主席著作，进一步认识到，能不能到贫苦牧民中间去并和他们打成一片，这是忠不忠于毛主席革命路线的分界线。只有和贫苦牧民同甘共苦，防止生活特殊化，才能培养起劳动人民的优秀品质，才能养成艰苦奋斗的作风，才有可能彻底改造世界观。他们决定走出十人小天地，走出单独的蒙古包，搬到贫苦牧民们的家里去。
    草原上的贫苦牧民们，把这些来自北京的青年人，当作自己的儿女、兄妹看待，无微不至地关怀他们的成长。一些老年人认为不能让这些孩子们忘记阶级斗争，常对他们介绍大队的阶级和阶级斗争的情况，讲述自己在旧社会受压迫、受剥削的血泪史，使他们受到深刻的阶级教育。特别是广大贫苦牧民对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱、无限忠诚，深深感动着这些青年人。他们来到这里，牧民向他们说的第一句话，就是：“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”他们看到，许多牧民的咿呀学语的孩子，学会的第一句话就是“毛主席万岁！”学会的第一支歌就是《东方红》。有些人多次邀请这些从毛主席身边来的红卫兵小将，讲述见到伟大领袖毛主席时的情景。有的用蒙古语教他们唱《祝福毛主席万寿无疆！》、《下定决心》等歌曲。牧民们居住分散，可是每到晚上毛泽东思想学习班开展活动的时候，蒙古包里总是挤得满满的。不管干活多累，天气多冷，夜间多黑，路途多远，大伙儿不喝茶、不吃饭也要先赶去学习。如吉仁台家的老妈妈，每次学习都去参加。她说：“我活到老，毛主席著作就要学到老。”这一切对这些初来牧区的青年人，是多大的教育和鼓舞啊！他们都暗暗地下了决心，要向贫苦牧民学习。
    去年冬天，雪大天冷。晚上，有的贫苦牧民用自己的毡子、被子围在篱笆上给集体的牲畜挡风。寒冷的深夜，有的羊冻僵了，牧民们就把羊抱进蒙古包里，饮水喂料。贫苦牧民浩涛特格从羊群里把老、弱羊挑出来送到暖棚里喂草料的时候，知识青年王静植发现还有一只很瘦的羊没有挑出来，就说：“阿爸（大爷），把这只也挑出来吧，不然会冻死的。”不料，浩涛特格看了看说：“没有关系，这是我们的自留畜，以后再说，集体的羊可一只也不能耽误啊！”浩涛特格这种一心为公的高贵品质，使她受到很大教育。
    有一次，知识青年胡志坚出去放羊，又冷又渴。起初，他坚持不回家喝茶。他想：离开羊群，羊就会跑远，万一发生了问题就对不起人民了。后来渴得实在不行了，他就跑回家喝茶。刚端起茶碗，心里感到不是滋味。赶快放下碗出来一看，羊群已经跑远了。他把羊群赶回来后，翻开《纪念白求恩》，用白求恩同志对工作极端负责的精神和老牧民一心为公的思想对照自己，觉得很惭愧。以后，不管再冷、再饿、再渴，也坚决跟群放羊了。
    现在，他们中间不少人都已是草原上受人称赞的“羊倌”了。宁华每次都是徒步出去放羊，而且要翻山越岭，很累，但他从不叫苦。有一次，他放羊迷了路，但他紧跟羊群一步不离。当时他只有一个念头：绝不能丢掉集体的一只羊。他放的羊群里有三、四只羊走不动了，他就一只只地把它们背回来。
    平时，他们都争着给贫苦牧民办好事，只要贫苦牧民们需要的，他们就做，就帮。有一次，王静植帮助大队民兵连长、团支部书记吉仁台家刨冻羊粪，吉仁台怕累着她，不肯让她干，王静植认真地说：“我不是白音（牧主），我们不是为享福来的。毛主席教导我们说：‘越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志’，我们革命青年就应该这样！”说完抡起镐头大干起来。
    白音宝力格大队，离医院比较远，牧民看病不大方便。小将们看到这种情况很着急，决定让金昆学习当卫生员。金昆决心为牧民服务，刻苦学习。她学得很快，现在已能治一般常见疾病了，很受牧民的欢迎。
    毛主席教导我们说：“知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成”。这些曾经同中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的资产阶级反动路线作过坚决斗争的红卫兵小将们，个个表示，要坚决遵照毛主席的教导，走和工农群众相结合的道路，决不做“半截革命者”，要永远忠于毛主席，紧跟毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，到阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动的战场上去滚一身泥巴，沾一身油污，把自己锻炼成为无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人。
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”北京的这十位知识青年来到内蒙古草原虽然只有短短几个月的时间，但他们克服了重重困难，在草原上扎下了根，在和工农群众相结合的革命化大道上迈出了坚实的步伐。他们在红太阳的照耀下，正在内蒙古草原上茁壮地成长。　　　　　　　　　　　　　新华社记者
