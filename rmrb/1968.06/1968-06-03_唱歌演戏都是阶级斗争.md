Our old political instructor, Comrade Men He, loved to sing revolutionary songs and perform revolutionary plays. He often helped us arrange performances and took to the stage with us.

Comrade Men's love for singing and acting was not just for entertainment. He saw further and thought deeper than we did. I remember when the performance troupe in our company was just established, some comrades thought that holding evening events and performances was just to make everyone happy. Comrade Men didn't see it that way. He often told us, "Don't underestimate art. Singing a song, performing a play, is a political class. It is class struggle!" To help us raise our awareness, before every rehearsal and performance, he would organize us to study Chairman Mao's teachings from "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art": "To make literature and art a component of the revolutionary machine as a whole, as a powerful weapon for uniting and educating the people, for attacking and annihilating the enemy, to help the people fight the enemy heart and soul." Chairman Mao's great teachings opened our eyes and corrected our performance direction.

One day in 1963, our company held an evening event, and all the officers and soldiers took to the stage to perform. The usually low-profile cook, Comrade Zhao Chengguo, sang a fast-paced song in Qinghai dialect, "Our Cooking Team," praising the good deeds and people who emerged from studying Chairman Mao's works. This performance sparked discussions: some said the performance was poor and the level was low, while others said the actions were poor but the content was good. From the discussions, Comrade Men realized that these two different opinions reflected a struggle between two different artistic ideologies. He should help comrades raise their awareness and correct their thinking. Therefore, Comrade Men educated us. He enthusiastically praised the cooking team's performance, saying it was good and of high level. He said, "It is good because it performs our company's good deeds and people, and it is high because it propagates Mao Zedong Thought." He called on everyone to learn from the cooking team and turn the stage into a platform for propagating Mao Zedong Thought.

Great Leader Chairman Mao taught us: "The struggle between socialism and capitalism in the ideological realm in our country, as to who will vanquish whom, will take a fairly long period of time to settle." Liu Shaoqi and Zhou Yang and their clique used the power they had usurped to stage performances of emperors, generals, and romantic tales nationwide, creating a counter-revolutionary public opinion to pave the way for the restoration of capitalism. In the past, under the control of the capitalist roaders within the Party, the Baqing Farm was no exception, staging poisonous plays like "The Jade Hall Spring." Comrade Men saw this with his own eyes and hated it in his heart. On one hand, he educated everyone not to watch those rotten things, saying, "Watching those things will cause poisoning. We must reform old plays and not let old plays reform us!" On the other hand, he actively organized everyone to perform "soldiers performing for soldiers," sing revolutionary songs, perform revolutionary plays, and vigorously propagate Mao Zedong Thought. He not only took the lead in performing but also personally wrote revolutionary artistic programs. Low culture, no problem; busy work, no problem. He often worked busy all day, and sometimes after the performance ended and returned to the company, he would still sit under the lamp at night, flipping through Chairman Mao's precious books, looking up words in the dictionary, revising already performed programs, and supplementing new programs. He wrote one program after another, each expressing his love for Great Leader Chairman Mao, each praising the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. "Mao Zedong Thought Illuminates the World," "The Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers in the Mao Zedong Era," "Mao Zedong Thought Cultivates New People" ... These programs were all welcomed by the broad masses of officers, soldiers, and revolutionary people.

In 1964, on National Day, our company and the farm held a joint celebration. Comrade Men led the performance troupe to take the stage first to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, which was warmly welcomed by the masses. Immediately, the drums sounded, and the romantic tales began. Comrade Men, who was just taking off his costume, could not hold back his anger and immediately ordered the duty platoon leader to take the entire unit out of the venue. This showed a revolutionary soldier's unyielding stance in defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line.

Comrade Men He consistently and firmly implemented Chairman Mao's great principle of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving proletarian politics. He made artistic activities closely coordinate with the current political tasks. Just days before his martyrdom, to respond to Chairman Mao's call to "Support the Army and Love the People," he told us to hurriedly rehearse programs and perform deeply in the farm and people's commune. He also made specific arrangements for the performance content. Who would have thought that this was Comrade Men He's last arrangement for our performance troupe.

Comrade Deputy Instructor Men has been away from us for more than eight months. However, his brave and steadfast heart in defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line is always inspiring and encouraging us to move forward. We, as the performance troupe personally cultivated by Comrade Men He, will inherit Comrade Men He's will, forever sing revolutionary songs, perform revolutionary plays, bravely defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line, and forever sing the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

    唱歌演戏都是阶级斗争
    门合同志生前所在连演唱组
    我们的老指导员门合同志，最爱唱革命歌，最爱演革命戏。他经常同我们一起编排节目，一起登台演出。
    门指导员喜爱唱歌、演戏，不单是为了娱乐，他比我们看得远，想得深。记得连里演唱组刚刚成立的时候，有的同志认为开晚会、演节目无非是叫大家乐一乐。门指导员可不这样看，他常给我们讲：“别小看文艺，唱一支歌，演一出戏，就是一堂政治课，就是阶级斗争！”为了帮助我们提高认识，每次排练节目和演出前，他都要组织我们学习毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》中的教导：“要使文艺很好地成为整个革命机器的一个组成部分，作为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器，帮助人民同心同德地和敌人作斗争。”毛主席的伟大教导，擦亮了我们的眼睛，端正了我们的演出方向。
    一九六三年的一天，连里开晚会，全连干部、战士纷纷登台表演。从来不露面的炊事员赵成国同志，用青海话演唱了快板《我们的炊事班》，表扬了炊事班活学活用毛主席著作涌现出来的好人好事。这个节目引起了大家的议论：有的说表演差劲水平低，有的说动作差点内容好。从大家的议论中，门指导员意识到，这两种不同意见，实际上是两种文艺思想斗争的反映。应该帮助同志们提高认识，端正思想。于是，门指导员对大家进行了教育。他热情地赞扬了炊事班的节目演得好，水平高。他说：“好就好在演的是咱们连的好人好事，高就高在宣传了毛泽东思想。”他号召大家向炊事班学习，把舞台变成宣传毛泽东思想的阵地。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“我国社会主义和资本主义之间在意识形态方面的谁胜谁负的斗争，还需要一个相当长的时间才能解决。”中国赫鲁晓夫和周扬一伙，利用篡夺的权力，在全国大演帝王将相、才子佳人，大造反革命舆论，为复辟资本主义鸣锣开道。过去在党内走资派操纵下的巴仓农场也不例外，大演《玉堂春》等毒草戏。门指导员看在眼里，恨在心里。他一面教育大家不要去看那些臭玩艺，说：“看那些东西会中毒。我们要改造旧戏，不能让旧戏改造我们！”一面积极组织大家开展“兵演兵”，大唱革命歌，大演革命戏，大力宣传毛泽东思想。他不但自己带头演出，而且亲自动手编写革命的文艺节目。文化低，难不倒；工作忙，挤不倒。他常常忙碌一天，有时演出结束回到连里，深夜还要坐在灯下，一边翻阅着毛主席的宝书，一边查字典，修改已经演出的节目，补充编写新节目。他编写的节目一个又一个，个个表现对伟大领袖毛主席的热爱，个个颂扬战无不胜的毛泽东思想。《毛泽东思想照天下》、《毛泽东时代的工农兵》、《毛泽东思想育新人》……这些节目，都受到了广大干部战士和革命群众的欢迎。
    一九六四年国庆节，连里和农场联欢。门指导员带领演唱组首先登台宣传毛泽东思想，受到了群众的热烈欢迎。紧接着锣鼓一响，才子佳人戏开演了。正在卸装的门指导员忍不住心中的怒火，立即叫值星排长把部队全部带出了会场。表现了一个革命战士无限忠于毛主席革命文艺路线的坚定立场。
    门合同志一贯坚定地贯彻执行毛主席关于文艺为工农兵服务、为无产阶级政治服务的伟大方针，使文艺活动紧密地配合当前的政治任务。就在他牺牲的前几天，为了响应毛主席发出的“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，他连夜告诉我们赶排节目，深入农场和人民公社进行演出，并对演出的内容作了具体的安排。万万没有想到，这竟是门合同志对我们演唱组最后的一次安排。
    门副教导员离开我们已经八个多月了。但是，他那勇敢捍卫毛主席革命文艺路线的赤胆红心，时刻在激励和鼓舞着我们前进。我们，作为门合同志亲手培育出来的演唱组，决心继承门合同志的遗志，永远大唱革命歌，大演革命戏，勇敢捍卫毛主席的革命文艺路线，永远高歌战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
