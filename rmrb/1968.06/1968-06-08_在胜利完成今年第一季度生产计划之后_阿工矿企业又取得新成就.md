The production plans for refined copper and copper wire were also significantly overfulfilled.

Workers in the machinery manufacturing industry, who are deeply engaged in the scientific and technological innovation movement, completed and significantly overfulfilled the tasks of producing machinery, assemblies, and components for various economic sectors.

Workers on the front lines of the building materials industry provided a large quantity of cement, bricks, and timber beyond the plan for the new construction projects of the Fourth Five-Year Plan.

Albania's young chemical industry also overfulfilled the production plans for phosphate fertilizer, nitrogen fertilizer, and other products in April.
