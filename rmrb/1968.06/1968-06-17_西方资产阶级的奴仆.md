Before the Khrushchev revisionist clique seized power in the Soviet Union, the heads of American imperialism relentlessly attacked the socialist Soviet Union as a "country behind the iron curtain," advocating for the Soviet Union to become a so-called "open society," and using this as the goal of U.S. policy towards the Soviet Union.

American imperialists' so-called "open society" is, in essence, to transform the socialist system into a capitalist system and to change the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. In this way, the political, economic, and cultural invasion forces led by the United States can freely enter the Soviet Union.

After the Soviet revisionist traitor clique came to power, they precisely catered to the intentions of imperialism. This gang of traitors not only spared no effort in restoring capitalism within the Soviet Union but also slavishly implemented an "open door" policy towards imperialism. They opened up the Soviet Union's economic resources to foreign monopolistic capital, opened up the Soviet market to the "surplus" goods of Western capitalist countries. They also opened the doors wide to the decadent culture and lifestyle of Western capitalist countries, allowing them to flood into the Soviet Union in large quantities. This was not enough; they also, under the guise of developing so-called "international tourism," actively attracted "tourists" from Western capitalist countries, allowing hundreds of thousands of foreign bourgeoisie and their wives to come to the Soviet Union each year to seek pleasure. The "open door" policy implemented by the Soviet revisionist traitors is truly thorough.

The Soviet revisionist traitor clique's promotion of so-called "international tourism," allowing a large number of Western bourgeoisie "tourists" to flood into the Soviet Union, is obviously a reflection of the fact that the socialist regime in the Soviet Union has already changed color. The small clique of the bourgeois privileged class that seized power in the Soviet Union are kin to the Western bourgeoisie. Therefore, they naturally want to curry favor with these wealthy relatives in the West and regard entertaining these wealthy relatives as the highest "honor." The Soviet revisionist traitors, who ride roughshod over the laboring people at home and turn the Soviet Union into a "paradise" for the bourgeoisie, naturally want to turn the vast Soviet territory into a playground where Western bourgeoisie and their wives can enjoy themselves to the fullest. The crimes of Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their ilk fully prove that they are servants of the international bourgeoisie, traitors to the Soviet people, and scum of the Soviet nation.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The rule of revisionism will not last long." The Soviet people, with their glorious revolutionary tradition, will never tolerate a small clique of traitors ruining the Soviet Union in this way. The great revolutionary storm will eventually overturn the cannibalistic feast of the Soviet bourgeois privileged class and destroy the paradise that the Soviet revisionist traitors have provided for the Western bourgeoisie.

    西方资产阶级的奴仆
    在赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团篡夺苏联的政权以前，美帝国主义的头子们拚命攻击社会主义的苏联是什么“铁幕国家”，鼓吹要苏联成为所谓“开放的社会”，并且以此作为美国对苏政策的目标。
    美帝国主义者的所谓“开放的社会”，说穿了，就是要把社会主义制度变为资本主义制度，使无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。这样，以美国为首的帝国主义的政治、经济、文化等侵略势力，就可以大摇大摆地进入苏联了。
    苏修叛徒集团上台以后，恰恰就是竭力迎合了帝国主义的这个意旨。这一伙叛徒不仅竭尽全力在苏联复辟资本主义，而且奴颜婢膝地对帝国主义实行“门户开放”政策。他们把苏联的经济资源开放给外国垄断资本，把苏联的市场开放给西方资本主义国家的“过剩”商品。他们对西方资本主义国家的腐朽文化和生活方式更是敞开门户，让它们大量涌进苏联，泛滥成灾。这还不够，他们又以开展所谓“国际旅行事业”为名，大肆招徕西方资本主义国家的“游客”，每年让上百万的外国资产阶级老爷太太们到苏联去寻欢作乐。苏修叛徒实行的这种“门户开放”政策，真是够彻底的了。
    苏修叛徒集团大搞其所谓“国际旅行事业”，让大批的西方资产阶级“游客”涌入苏联，这情况显然是苏联的社会主义江山早已变色的一种反映。篡夺了苏联政权的一小撮资产阶级特权阶层，同西方资产阶级是一家人。因此，他们很自然地要去巴结这些西方的阔亲戚，并且把招待这些阔亲戚看作是无上的“光荣”。苏修叛徒集团在国内骑在劳动人民头上作威作福，把苏联变为资产阶级的“天堂”，因此，他们也就很自然地要把广大的苏联国土变为西方资产阶级老爷太太们可以尽情享受的乐园。勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流的这种罪行充分证明，他们是国际资产阶级的奴仆，是苏联人民的叛徒，是苏联民族的败类。
    我们的伟大导师毛主席指出：“修正主义的统治是不会长久的”。具有光荣革命传统的苏联人民绝不会容忍一小撮叛徒把苏联这样糟踏下去。伟大的革命风暴终将打翻苏联资产阶级特权阶层的吃人的筵席，并摧毁苏修叛徒集团给西方资产阶级所提供的乐园。
