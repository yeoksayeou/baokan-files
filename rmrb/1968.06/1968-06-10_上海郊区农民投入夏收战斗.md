In the midst of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Shanghai's suburban rural areas have reported a bumper harvest of summer crops. The harvest situation in ten counties indicates that wheat yields have generally increased by one to three times compared to the bumper harvest of last year. The widely planted rapeseed is also laden with pods, large and plump, presenting a scene of abundant harvest.

Currently, Shanghai's suburban rural areas are filled with the joy of revolutionary and production victories. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres are seriously implementing Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production." In the fields and threshing grounds, they continue to deeply carry out the revolutionary criticism campaign. At the same time, with great revolutionary enthusiasm, they are engaged in the intense battle of harvesting and threshing. They enthusiastically discuss the excellent situation of this summer's harvest, hailing it as a victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and as the fruit of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to guide agricultural production.

With the continuous development and victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in Shanghai's suburban rural areas has become increasingly widespread and deep. Mao Zedong Thought study classes have developed from being held in counties and communes to being held in production brigades and production teams, and even in the homes of commune members. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants regard Chairman Mao's instructions as the highest criterion for their words and actions, thus fundamentally ensuring the victorious advance of revolution and production in the suburban rural areas.

    上海郊区农民投入夏收战斗
    据新华社上海八日电　在无产阶级文化大革命中阔步前进的上海郊区农村，传来了夏熟作物丰收的喜讯。十个县的收获情况表明，麦子产量一般比丰收的去年增产一到三成。大面积种植的油菜也结荚累累，荚长粒大，呈现一派丰收景象。
    目前，上海郊区农村到处洋溢着革命和生产双胜利的喜悦。广大贫下中农和革命干部认真贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，在田头，在脱粒场上，继续深入开展革命大批判；同时，以极大的革命热情投入紧张的收割和脱粒的夏收战斗。他们满怀革命豪情畅谈今年夏收的大好形势，欢呼这是无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，是活学活用毛泽东思想，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想统帅农业生产的成果。
    随着无产阶级文化大革命的不断胜利发展，上海郊区农村活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动也越来越广泛深入地展开。毛泽东思想学习班，已经从县、公社办，大队、生产队办，发展到社员家庭普遍办。广大贫下中农把毛主席的指示作为自己言论和行动的最高准则，从根本上保证了郊区农村革命和生产的胜利前进。
