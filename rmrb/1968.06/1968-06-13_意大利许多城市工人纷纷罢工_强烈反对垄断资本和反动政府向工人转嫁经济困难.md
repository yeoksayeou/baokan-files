Workers in many Italian cities have been going on strike in recent days, strongly opposing the attempts by monopolistic capital and the reactionary government to shift economic difficulties onto the workers.

	According to a report from Rome on June 12, workers in cities such as Palermo, Marsala, and Trieste have been staging strikes and demonstrations. In Palermo, southern Sicily, thousands of metalworkers, machine manufacturers, and shipbuilders marched on June 11, demanding wage increases and full employment.

	In Marsala, Sicily, workers held a general strike on June 10 to protest the government's imposition of a massive additional tax on citizens. Over five thousand workers held a rally and marched through the streets. All shops were closed, and government offices suspended operations.

	In Trieste, northern Italy, more than thirteen thousand metalworkers and machine manufacturers went on strike and demonstrated for full employment.

	In Naples, workers at an electric motor factory controlled by the American General Electric Company occupied the factory, protesting the company's attempt to shift difficulties onto the workers.

	In Pisa, the owner of a textile factory closed the factory to cut costs, angering the workers. The workers surrounded the factory, set up tents outside, and established a command center to prepare for a struggle against the capitalists.
