A graduate of Beijing Ditan Middle School, Xu Guizhi, is departing tomorrow to settle down in the countryside of Northeast China. In the evening, neighbors, classmates, and teachers all came to her home to see her off. Everyone gathered in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's quotations. Then, Aunt Xu carried out a basin of coarse grain and vegetable dumplings and placed them on the table. Uncle Xu stood by the table and said, "Comrades, you have come to see Guizhi off. I have nothing to offer you. Please join Guizhi in eating a meal of hardship."

Uncle Xu continued, "Every time I see these coarse grain and vegetable dumplings, I am reminded of my hard life as a young miner in the Northeast. When I was nineteen, our family had no choice but to flee to the Northeast to work in the mines. In the old society, life was as dark as crows everywhere. In the Northeast, we worked day and night, but we couldn't even afford these dumplings. My father, old and weak, was kicked out by the capitalist and starved to death."

Aunt Xu, tears streaming down her face, looked at the portrait of Chairman Mao on the wall and pointed to the dumplings on the table. "Children, eat! If you don't taste the bitterness of the old society, you won't know the sweetness of today. Before liberation, when I was your age, I was a wandering beggar. At eleven, the landlord drove us to the point of desperation, and my father had no choice but to send me to the Xu family as a child bride. In the old society, the Xu family and ours were like bitter gourds on the same vine, with no house and no land, eating coarse grain and vegetables to fill our stomachs. I gave birth to seven children, all of whom died in that wicked old society. Guizhi was born after liberation. She has been sickly since childhood, falling ill every few days. If it were the old society, she would have died long ago. It is Chairman Mao and the Communist Party who saved us from the abyss and educated you from elementary school to middle school. Without the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, there would be no us. Today, Chairman Mao calls on you to go to the mountains and countryside, to build our socialist motherland with the workers and peasants. This is the greatest care and love for you, and it is also your bright future. As long as it is the path pointed out by Chairman Mao, we poor and lower-middle peasants will follow it to the end."

Everyone ate the dumplings, listening to Uncle Xu's family recounting the hardships of the old society, and their hearts were deeply moved. Cao Yuling, sitting in the corner, stood up and said, "Under the influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev, when the graduation assignment began, I thought the countryside was hard and going to the mountains and countryside was a loss, producing the thought of not wanting to go to the Northeast. This is forgetting one's roots and being disloyal to Chairman Mao. In the future, I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's words, walk the path of integrating with the workers and peasants, and be good children of the poor and lower-middle peasants, going to where the motherland needs us most, and striving hard for life."

At this point, Guizhi could no longer sit still. She said with tears in her eyes, "The heavens are vast, the earth is vast, but nothing is greater than the Party's kindness. Parents are dear, but Chairman Mao is dearer. Chairman Mao and the Communist Party have raised us. We, the descendants of the poor and lower-middle peasants and the working people, want to avoid being beasts of burden and avoid a second round of exploitation, we must follow Chairman Mao's words and follow the Communist Party. I will definitely remember the bitterness of the old society and not forget the sweetness of the new society, and follow Chairman Mao to do revolution for life."

This unusual farewell banquet left a deep impression on the students and teachers who attended. As they parted, the students said, "This is a vivid class education, inspiring us to forever be loyal to Chairman Mao and follow the path of integrating with the workers and peasants as pointed out by Chairman Mao!"

    不平常的送行“聚餐”
    北京地坛中学毕业生许桂芝同学，明天就要出发到东北农村去安家落户了。晚上，街坊邻居、同学、老师都来到她家送行。大家围坐在毛主席像前，一遍又一遍地学习毛主席语录。接着，许大妈从屋里端出了一盆糠菜团子放在桌上，许大伯站在桌前说：同志们来给桂芝送行，我没有什么来招待你们，请大家和桂芝一同来吃一顿忆苦饭。接着许大伯又说：“我一看到这糠菜团子，就想起我年青时到东北当矿工的苦难生活。我十九岁那年，家里生活实在没有办法，一家五口人逃荒到东北当矿工。旧社会天下乌鸦一般黑，到了东北，一天到晚拚死拚活地干，连这样的糠菜团子都吃不上，我父亲年老体衰干不动活，被资本家一脚踢出门外，活活的饿死了。”
    许大妈流着激动的泪水看着墙上的毛主席像，指着桌子上的糠菜团子说：“孩子们吃吧！不尝尝旧社会穷人的苦，就不知道今日的甜。解放前我象你（指桂芝）这样大的时候还是一个逃荒要饭都摸不着门的苦孩子。我十一岁的时候，地主逼得我们走投无路，爹只好把我送到许家当童养媳。旧社会许家和我们都是一根藤上的苦瓜，照样是房无一间，地无一垄，吃糠咽菜糊不住口。我一连生了七个孩子都死在那万恶的旧社会。桂芝是我解放后才生的，她从小病多，三天两头闹病，要是在旧社会早就死去了，是毛主席和共产党把我们从火坑里救了出来，又是共产党毛主席把你们培养成人，从小学读书到中学。没有毛主席和共产党的领导，就没有我们一家。今天毛主席号召你们上山下乡，和工农群众一道建设我们的社会主义祖国，这是对你们最大的关心、最大的爱护，这也是你们光明的前途。只要是毛主席指出的路，我们贫下中农就要坚决走，走到底。”
    大家吃着糠菜团子，听着许大伯一家对旧社会的控诉，心情都十分激动。坐在房角的曹玉玲同学站起来说：“在中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义教育路线的影响下，毕业分配开始时，我认为农村艰苦，上山下乡是吃亏，产生了不愿到东北去的思想，这就是忘本，是对毛主席的不忠。今后一定要听毛主席的话，走和工农相结合的路，当贫下中农的好儿女，到祖国最需要的地方去，艰苦奋斗一辈子。”这时桂芝再也坐不住了，她含着热泪说：“天大地大不如党的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲。毛主席和共产党把我们培养成人，我们贫下中农、劳动人民的后代，想不再当牛做马、不吃第二遍剥削苦，就要听毛主席的话，跟共产党走。我一定要牢记旧社会的苦，不忘新社会的甜，跟着毛主席干一辈子革命。”
    这次不平常的送行“聚餐”，给到会的同学、老师留下了极深刻的印象。临别时，同学们说：这是一堂生动的阶级教育课，激励我们永远忠于毛主席，走毛主席指出的和工农相结合的道路！
