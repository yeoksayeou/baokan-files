The Albanian "People's Voice" published an editorial on June 23 exposing and condemning the intensified counter-revolutionary global collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union since the Glassboro talks, and their plot to sabotage the world's people's revolution. The editorial pointed out that the developments since the Glassboro talks clearly prove that the U.S. imperialist leader Johnson and the Soviet revisionist Khrushchev plotted new conspiracies against the highest interests of the people of various countries during this meeting.

The editorial said that the Glassboro conspiracy has become one of the cornerstones of the hegemonic policies pursued by the two superpowers, the U.S. and the Soviet Union, to divide spheres of influence and rule the world.

The editorial cited facts to show that the Soviet revisionist leadership has spared no effort to collaborate with the U.S. in carrying out counter-revolutionary conspiracies. The editorial said that the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists are trying to suppress the heroic liberation war of the Vietnamese people. After the Glassboro talks, the U.S. aggressors gradually escalated their aggression in Vietnam, increasing the number of U.S. troops in South Vietnam to over 500,000 and intensifying the savage bombing of North Vietnam. However, the heroic Vietnamese people foiled their plans and dealt heavy blows to the U.S. aggressors. Thus, the U.S. imperialist leader Johnson hastened to play the "peace talks" trick to gain at the negotiating table what he could not achieve by force. The Soviet revisionist leadership, in accordance with the secret plans plotted behind the scenes in Glassboro against the interests of the Vietnamese people, eagerly promoted Johnson's "peace talks" to help the U.S. imperialists realize this conspiracy.

The editorial pointed out that just a few days after the imperialists and Israel launched their aggression against the United Arab Republic, Syria, and other Arab countries, Khrushchev held talks with Johnson in Glassboro. The Soviet revisionists betrayed the Arab countries at a critical moment and continued to secretly plot conspiracies harmful to the Arab countries. The developments over the past year have clearly proven this. The infamous resolution on solving the Middle East crisis adopted by the United Nations Security Council on November 22, 1967, was merely the result of backroom deals between Washington and Moscow. This resolution sacrificed the highest interests of the Arab people and actually satisfied and encouraged the expansionist desires of the Israeli aggressors.

The editorial said that after the Glassboro talks, the Soviet revisionist leadership further intensified its collusion with the U.S. in political, economic, cultural, and military fields. One year after the Glassboro talks, the U.S. and the Soviet Union signed two important agreements: one is the so-called "Non-Proliferation Treaty," which Johnson boasted as the "greatest victory of 1968"; the other is the Consular Convention. The "Non-Proliferation Treaty" is a new conspiracy by the U.S. and the Soviet Union against the highest interests of the people of various countries. It imposes the will of imperialism and revisionism on non-nuclear countries and, under the pretext of a "nuclear umbrella," helps countries like India, which are adjacent to China, strengthen the "ring of fire" planned by the U.S. and the Soviet Union to encircle the People's Republic of China. This is the wolfish ambition of the drafters of this infamous treaty.

The editorial said that the process of intensifying U.S.-Soviet collusion is developing at a high speed. The heads of American trusts, billionaire capitalists, and businessmen are flocking to Moscow for "visits." The Khrushchev revisionists not only opened the doors of the Soviet Union to monopolist capitalists but also to bourgeois ideology, decadent culture, and Western lifestyles.

The editorial said that the Soviet revisionist leadership's policy of capitulation has emboldened the U.S. imperialists' aggression, making them more arrogant and reckless. The Soviet revisionists have created favorable conditions for the revival of the darkest reactionary and fascist forces in the United States, West Germany, Japan, France, and other countries. The center of imperialism, the United States, is increasingly heading down the path of militarism and fascism. Today, with the support of U.S. imperialism and the encouragement of the Soviet revisionists, militarists and revanchists are resurfacing in the Federal Republic of Germany. The "Emergency Powers Law" passed by the West German parliament clearly proves this.

The editorial concluded by pointing out that today, when the Brezhnev-Kosygin traitorous clique has betrayed the revolution and socialism and is engaged in joint ventures with U.S. imperialism, Johnson and the resurgent fascist forces are directing their arrows at the People's Republic of China, socialist Albania, and the revolutionary forces of the world. In view of this situation, the revolutionary forces are more clearly aware that they are facing cunning and ferocious enemies. They are becoming more united in their struggle against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered on the Brezhnev-Kosygin traitorous clique. In this great struggle, the revolutionary forces are stronger today. At the forefront of the struggle to defend the revolution and socialism are the great People's Republic of China, socialist Albania, and the increasingly powerful and healthy revolutionary forces of the world. The future and victory belong to these forces, while imperialism and revisionism, which are in crisis, disintegrating, and declining, are bound to fail.

    阿《人民之声报》谴责美苏葛拉斯堡罗会谈一年来的反革命勾结
    苏修的投降政策助长了美帝侵略
    全世界革命力量更加团结强大，帝国主义修正主义必然失败
    新华社地拉那二十五日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》二十三日发表社论，揭露并谴责美、苏自葛拉斯堡罗会谈以来加紧反革命全球勾结，破坏世界人民革命的阴谋。社论指出，美帝国主义头子约翰逊和苏联修正主义者柯西金在葛拉斯堡罗举行会谈一年以来的事态发展清楚地证明，他们在这次会谈中策划了反对各国人民最高利益的新阴谋。
    社论说，葛拉斯堡罗的阴谋已成为美苏两大国为分配势力范围和统治全世界而奉行的称霸政策的基石之一。
    社论列举事实说明苏联修正主义领导集团不遗余力地配合美帝推行反革命阴谋。社论说，美帝国主义和苏联修正主义者力图镇压英勇的越南人民的解放战争。在葛拉斯堡罗会谈后，美国侵略者使他们在越南的侵略逐步升级，把在南越的美军增加到五十万人以上，并对越南北方加紧野蛮轰炸。但是英雄的越南人民粉碎了他们的计划，给了美国侵略军沉重的打击。这样，美帝国主义头子约翰逊就加紧玩弄“和谈”阴谋，以便在会议桌上取得他们用武力所取不到的东西。而苏修领导集团按照在葛拉斯堡罗幕后策划的、反对越南人民利益的秘密计划，竭力吹捧约翰逊所鼓吹的“和谈”，以帮助美帝国主义实现这个阴谋。
    社论指出，一年前，仅仅在帝国主义和以色列对阿联、叙利亚等阿拉伯国家发动侵略后几天，柯西金就同约翰逊在葛拉斯堡罗举行了会谈。苏修在关键性时刻出卖了阿拉伯国家，此后又继续秘密策划危害阿拉伯国家的阴谋。这一年的事态发展过程清楚地证明了这一点。联合国安全理事会一九六七年十一月二十二日通过的声名狼藉的所谓解决中东危机的决议，只不过是华盛顿和莫斯科幕后交易的结果。这个决议牺牲了阿拉伯各国人民的最高利益，实际上满足和鼓励了以色列侵略者扩张主义的欲望。
    社论说，苏修领导集团在葛拉斯堡罗会谈以后，进一步在政治、经济、文化、军事等各方面同美帝加紧勾结。葛拉斯堡罗会谈一年后的今天，苏美缔结了两项重要的协议，一项是被约翰逊标榜为“一九六八年最大胜利”的骗人的所谓“防止核扩散条约”；另一项是领事条约。“防止核扩散条约”是美苏反对各国人民最高利益的一个新阴谋。它把帝国主义、修正主义的意旨强加于无核国家，并且在“核保护伞”的名义下，帮助印度等同中国毗邻的国家加强由美苏策划的对中华人民共和国的“火力包围圈”，这就是这项臭名远扬的条约的炮制者的狼子野心。
    社论说，加紧美苏勾结的过程正在高速度地发展着。美国托辣斯的头子们，有亿万财富的资本家和商人们纷纷到莫斯科去进行“访问”。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者不仅向垄断资本家们，而且向资产阶级思想、腐朽的文化和西方生活方式敞开苏联的大门。
    社论说，苏修领导的投降政策助长了美帝国主义者的侵略，使他们更加蛮横和放肆。苏修为最黑暗的反动势力、法西斯势力在美国、西德、日本、法国等地复活创造了有利的基础。帝国主义的中心美国正在越来越走上军国主义化和法西斯化的道路。今天，由于美帝国主义的支持和苏修的鼓励，在德意志联邦共和国，军国主义分子和复仇主义者重新抬头。西德议会通过的“紧急状态法”就清楚地证明了这一点。
    社论最后指出，今天，当勃列日涅夫—柯西金叛卖集团背叛了革命和社会主义，当它同美帝国主义进行共同事业的时候，约翰逊和正在复活的法西斯势力就把矛头指向中华人民共和国、社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚和世界上的革命力量。鉴于这种情况，革命力量更加清楚他们面对着疯狂和狡猾的敌人。他们在反对以美国为首的帝国主义和以勃列日涅夫—柯西金叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争中越来越团结了。在这场大决斗中，革命力量今天更加强大了。在维护革命和社会主义的斗争的最前线，有伟大的人民中国、社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚和全世界越来越强大的健康的革命力量。未来和胜利是属于这些力量的，而陷入危机、分崩离析和衰退中的帝国主义和修正主义是必然要失败的。
