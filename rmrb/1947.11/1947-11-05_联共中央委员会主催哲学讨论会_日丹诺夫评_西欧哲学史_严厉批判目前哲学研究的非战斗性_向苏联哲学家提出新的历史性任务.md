Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: Moscow dispatch: In June of this year, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) hosted a grand philosophy discussion to review the book "History of Western European Philosophy" by Aleksandrov, Minister of Propaganda of the Communist Party. At that time, nearly a hundred well-known philosophers from across the country gathered to engage in heated discussions, ranging from criticism of the book itself to general philosophical issues. On August 24, Zhdanov, one of the secretaries of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, delivered a near-concluding speech, which not only comprehensively and profoundly reviewed the shortcomings of Aleksandrov's book, but also put forward great historical tasks to Soviet philosophers. Zhdanov pointed out that the main shortcomings of Aleksandrov's textbook are: (1) It fails to provide a correct and comprehensive definition of the science of the history of philosophy. Aleksandrov's definition states: "The history of philosophy is the history of mankind's progress, ascent, and development of knowledge about the surrounding universe, and it is also the history of explaining how many modern ideas have occurred and developed." Such a definition confuses the research object of the history of philosophy with the general history of science, treats "modern" as synonymous with "science," and sees philosophy as if it were the science of sciences. Based on the arguments of Engels and Lenin, Zhdanov put forward a new, complete, and clear definition, stipulating that "the history of philosophy is the history of the embryo, occurrence, and development of the scientific materialist worldview and its laws. Since materialism grows and develops in the struggle with idealist factions, the history of philosophy is also the history of the struggle between materialism and idealism." (2) Aleksandrov's textbook not only fails to understand that the emergence of Marxism and Marxist philosophy is a great philosophical revolution and a negation of the old philosophy, that Marxist philosophy has its strict party spirit and combativeness, and cannot compromise or reconcile with any bourgeois philosophy, but also makes principled errors, distortions, and ambiguities on these important issues. Moreover, in the narrative about the history of philosophy, Aleksandrov only talks about Western European philosophy, not Eastern European and Russian philosophy; he only writes the history of philosophy before 1848, but not the history of philosophy after the emergence of Marxism. Aleksandrov adopts an unprincipled and un-standpoint "objectivist" attitude towards the old bourgeois philosophers, with uncritical remarks such as these people "have shortcomings but also achievements." All these show that the author has repeated the false theory of "two cultures of East and West" by bourgeois scholars, and unconsciously exposed that the author has become a prisoner of bourgeois philosophical thought. (3) The author's purpose in studying the history of philosophy is also ambiguous, and it is only a passive academic research, neglecting the task of developing Marxism. Zhdanov pointed out that one of the basic tasks of studying philosophy is to "continue to develop philosophy that has become a science, find new laws, review old principles in practice, and replace outdated principles with new ones."

    In the second part of his speech, Zhdanov severely criticized the non-combative, backward, and blind nature of the current Soviet philosophical front. He said, "Other philosophers praised Aleksandrov's textbook and asked to award this textbook the Stalin Prize, which proves that there is a serious morbidity on our theoretical front." Currently, "the quantity of philosophical works is insufficient, and the quality is also poor." "Due to the insufficient combativeness of philosophers, they dare not try their strength on new practical problems, and now it is time to boldly advance the theory of Soviet society, the theory of the Soviet state, the theory of modern natural science, ethics, and aesthetics." Zhdanov then raised the question of studying and solving the driving force for the development of socialist society. He said, "The issue of criticism and self-criticism is not only a practical issue for our philosophers, but also a profound theoretical issue. If the content of the development process is, as dialectics says, the struggle between two opposing aspects, then our philosophers should prove how this law works under socialist conditions, and what are its characteristics? This is a vast field of research. But none of our philosophers has conducted research on it. In fact, our Party has long found a special form to expose and overcome the contradictions in socialism (these contradictions exist, but our philosophers are afraid to mention them because of their timidity), and has long found a special form of mutual struggle between the new and the old, the dying and the newborn in Soviet society, which is criticism and self-criticism, and has used it to serve socialism. In our Soviet society, mutually antagonistic classes have been eliminated, so the contradictions here are not manifested as class antagonism, but in the form of criticism and self-criticism. This is the real driving force of our development, this is the powerful tool that the Party has grasped, and this is undoubtedly a new form of movement, a new form of development, and a new dialectical law."

    Zhdanov finally pointed out that the theoretical and political tasks facing Soviet philosophers are very important, requiring everyone to work like Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin to complete these tasks. He pointed out that these tasks currently mainly include the following three items. He said: "(1) The victory of the Great Patriotic War against fascist aggression is also the glorious victory of Marxism. Now the center of opposition to Marxism has shifted to the United States and the United Kingdom. All dark and reactionary forces are now used to fight against Marxism. From the experience of Russia's victory over fascism, it can be seen what kind of dead end idealist philosophy has led many nations to. Now idealist philosophy appears again with a new despicable and dirty essence, absorbing hooligans and thieves in academia. The bourgeoisie has truly reached the extreme of corruption and decline, but these forces are still vital and can still poison the consciousness of the masses. Besides our victorious countries and their philosophers, who else can lead this struggle against corrupt and despicable bourgeois ideology?" "(2) Many new democratic countries and national liberation movements of colonial people have grown out of the ashes of war, and socialism has been put on the life agenda of all nations. Besides the countries where socialism has won victory and their philosophers, who else can help our friends and brothers abroad illuminate their struggle path with scientific socialist consciousness and inspire them to arm themselves with Marxist ideological weapons?" "(3) Socialist economy and culture are developing strongly in our country, and the continuous growth of the socialist consciousness of the masses is increasingly demanding more from our ideological front. A comprehensive offensive is being launched against the capitalist remnants in people's consciousness, all of which require our philosophers and the workers who lead the philosophical front to summarize the great experience of socialist construction and solve the new tasks of socialism with the Marxist theory of knowledge."

    联共中央委员会主催哲学讨论会
    日丹诺夫评“西欧哲学史”
    严厉批判目前哲学研究的非战斗性
    向苏联哲学家提出新的历史性任务
    【新华社陕北二日电】莫斯科讯：今年六月间联共（布）中央委员会曾主催一盛大的哲学讨论会，审查联共党宣传部长亚力山大洛夫所著“西欧哲学史”一书，当时，全国著名哲学家近百人济济一堂，从对该书本身的批判，直到一般的哲学问题，曾展开热烈急诊。八月二十四日，联共党中央书记之一日丹诺夫作了近乎总结性的发言，不仅全面地深刻地检讨了亚氏一书的缺点，而且向苏联的哲学家提出了伟大的历史性任务。日丹诺夫指出：亚氏教科书的主要缺点在于：（一）对哲学史这门科学不能给出一个正确而概括性的定义。亚氏的定义说：“哲学史就是人类对于周围宇宙的知识之前进，上升与发展的历史，也就是说明许多现代思想如何发生如何发展的历史”。这样的定义，把哲学史的研究对象与一般科学史混同，把“现代”当作“科学”的同义语，并把哲学看成似乎是科学的科学。日丹诺夫根据恩格斯与列宁的论点，提出了新的完整而明确的定义，规定“哲学史是科学的唯物主义世界观及其规律之胚胎，发生与发展的历史。既然唯物主义是在与唯心主义的派别斗争中生长与发展起来的，那么哲学史也就是唯物主义与唯心主义斗争的历史”。（二）亚氏教科书不仅不了解马克思主义的产生过程及马克思主义哲学之出现乃是一种伟大的哲学革命，和旧的哲学之否定，马克思主义哲学有其严格的党性及战斗性，不能与任何资产阶级哲学妥协与调和，在这些重要问题上亚氏犯了原则性的错误，歪曲与模糊不清，而且在关于哲学史的叙述上亚氏只谈西欧哲学，不谈东欧与俄国哲学，只写一八四八年以前的哲学史，而不写马克思主义产生以后的哲学史。亚氏对旧的资产阶级哲学家采取无原则无立场的客观主义态度，所谓这些人“有缺点也有成绩”之类的无批判态度。这些都表明作者是重复了资产阶级学者所谓“东西两种文化论”的虚伪理论，并暴露作者无意识地做了资产阶级哲学思想的俘虏。（三）作者对研究哲学史的目的性亦模糊不清，而只是一种消极的学院派的研究，忽视了发展马克思主义的任务。日丹诺夫指出，研究哲学的基本任务之一，乃是“继续发展已成为科学的哲学，找出新的规律，在实践中检阅旧的原则，用新的原则来代替已经陈旧的原则。”
    日丹诺夫在其第二部分发言中严厉地批判了目前苏联哲学战线的非战斗性，落后性，盲目性。他说“其他哲学家都称赞亚氏教科书，要求给这一教科书以斯大林奖金，这证明我国理论战线上有了严重的病态”。目前“哲学著作数量上不够，质量上也差”。“由于哲学家的战斗性不够，所以不敢在新的现实问题上试试自己的力量，而现在应是大胆地把苏维埃社会的理论，苏维埃国家的理论，现代自然科学的理论，伦理学与美学，推向前进的时候了。”日丹诺夫于此乃提出研究，并解决了社会主义社会发展的动力问题，他说：“批评与自我批评问题，对于我们哲学家不仅是一个实践问题，而且是一个深刻的理论问题。如果发展过程的内容是象辩证法所说的，就是两个对立方面的斗争；那么我们哲学家就应证明：这个规律在社会主义条件下如何发生作用，它的特点怎样？这就是研究工作的广大领域。而我们的哲学家中是没有一个人对它进行过研究的。其实我们党早已找到一种特殊形态来揭露和克服社会主义中的矛盾（这些矛盾是存在的，可是我们的哲学家因为胆怯，而不敢提到他们），早已找到苏维埃社会中那种在新的与旧的之间，衰亡的与新生的之间相互斗争的特殊形式，这就是批评与自我批评，并已把它拿来替社会主义服务。在我们苏维埃社会中已消灭了互相对抗的阶级，因此这里矛盾不表现为阶级的对抗，而表现在批评与自我批评的形式中。这就是我们发展的真正动力，这就是党所掌握的强大工具，这无疑是新的运动形态，新的发展形式，新的辩证规律性。”
    日丹诺夫最后指出：摆在苏联哲学家面前的理论与政治的任务，非常重大，要求大家象马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林一样地工作，完成这些任务。他指出这些任务，目前主要有以下三项，他说：（一）反法西斯侵略的伟大爱国战争的胜利，同时就是马克思主义的光荣胜利。现在反对马克思主义的中心，已经移到美国和英国去了，所有一切黑暗反动的势力，现在都用来向马克思主义作斗争。从俄国战胜法西斯的经验中，已经可以看出，唯心主义哲学把许多民族引上了怎样的绝路。现在唯心主义哲学又以新的可鄙的肮脏本质出现，在学术界吸收了市井无赖和强盗小偷，资产阶级真是到了腐化没落的极端，但是这些势力还是有生命力的，还是能够毒害群众意识的。除了我们已经胜利的国家及其哲学家，还有谁能够领导这种反对腐化卑鄙的资产阶级思想的斗争呢？”（二）从炮火的灰烬中生长出来了许多新民主主义国家和殖民地人民的民族解放运动，社会主义已提到了各民族人民的生活日程上。除了社会主义已获胜利的国家及其哲学家，还有谁能够帮助我们国外的朋友兄弟，用科学社会主义意识来照耀自己的斗争的道路，并启发他们用马克思主义的思想武器来武装他们呢？”（三）社会主义经济和文化，在我国正在强大发展起来，群众社会主义意识的不断增长，向我们思想战线的工作，日益提出更多的要求，对人们意识中的资本主义残余，正开展着全面的进攻，这些都需要我们的哲学家，领导哲学战线的工作者，用马克思主义的认识论，总结社会主义建设的巨大经验，解决社会主义的新任务。
