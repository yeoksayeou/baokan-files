Capture Chiang Kai-shek, And Grab Yan Xishan While We're At It!
　　15,000 Young Men from Taihang Enlist
[Our newspaper, Taihang, 10th dispatch] The liberated peasants in the old and new districts of Taihang, encouraged by the victory of our great army reaching the Yangtze River, have launched a wave of enthusiasm for joining the army. In the past month, more than 15,000 young men have bravely joined the counter-offensive army. Following the enlistment of more than 8,000 people from Anyang, Qi County, Tangyin, Bo’ai, Wen County, Xingtai and other counties, another 7,000 people from Pind Ding, Wu Xiang and Xingtai City have signed up to request to go south. Under the slogan "Join the counter-offensive army, capture Chiang Kai-shek! Grab Yan Xishan while we’re at it," Pind Ding alone had 117 district and village cadres requesting to join the army to serve the people and make contributions. Donggou Village in the sixth district formed a counter-offensive company in one day, with 204 young men signing up to participate. The enlistment in various parts of the third district fully demonstrated the spirit of enhanced class consciousness after the liberation of poor and hired peasants. The peasants emphasized using the criteria of "three wants and three don'ts" to review their armed forces, namely: 1. Want young men aged 18 to 35; 2. Want the liberated sons and daughters of poor, hired and middle peasants; 3. Want strong physiques; 1. Don't want those who were objects of struggle; 2. Don't want those with unclear political backgrounds; 3. Don't want the old, weak, or sick; and it must be done with the consent of the family, the individual, and the masses. Sun Shunian, the militia instructor of Hexia Village in the sixth district, was only seventeen years old and not old enough to join the army. He repeatedly asked his superiors, saying, "I'll be eighteen after the New Year!" He was happy only after he was allowed to join. Dong Xiaoyan, a 43-year-old worker from Wangjiazhuang in the third district, had lived in darkness for more than forty years. In the past, he didn't have an acre of land or a room. Now he has been liberated. Others advised him not to join the army, but he shouted at the meeting, "The Eighth Route Army is the team of us poor people. I am a worker, and I have waited more than forty years to be liberated. During the Three Kingdoms period, the old man Huang Zhong was eighty-three years old and still refused to admit he was old, so why can't I?" After repeated explanations, he was allowed to serve as a militiaman in the village, and that was the end of the matter. Zhou Haoxiang and Shi Xingtai, two old men from Beidajie in Xingtai City, were not allowed to join the army by others. They said, "I may be old, but my heart is not. I will shave my beard and join the army to go to Nanjing and capture old Chiang!" Wang Zhiru was getting married the next day, and others advised him to postpone his registration for a few days. He was anxious and said, "No way! I have to register before getting married." In the villages of Wu Xiang, during the "thorough liberation and rooting out of the old roots," cadres, party members, and liberated peasants responded to the Party's call and took the lead in joining the army. After the city gate checked the class and squeezed out the feudal elements to review the militia and armed forces, the poor and hired peasants unanimously felt: "We are in power and sitting on our own country, so we must protect it ourselves!" Comrade Gao Jinwen, the secretary of the branch, was the first to send his younger brother Gao Wenze to join the army. He said: "There are three brothers in my family. We herded sheep since we were young. We were only liberated when the Communist Party came. We must protect our time, or who will?" Then, Wang Tiangui, who had herded sheep since he was a child, and Duan Erniu, who had worked as a hired hand for landlords since he was twelve years old, and thirteen other poor and hired peasants all signed up together. Under the leadership of Comrade Li Song, the secretary of the Xingtai County Party Committee, more than 4,000 cadres and masses signed up to join the army in entire rows and platoons. At the expansion meeting of the Shahe County District, Fan Yujin, Shi Qiyun, Zhang Baoyi and other district cadres from poor and hired backgrounds requested to go south and asked for approval. Others, such as those in Shouyang, Ye County, and Xiuwu counties, had hundreds and thousands of young men enlisting. More than 90% of the 319 new soldiers in Xiuwu were liberated peasants. Currently, the enlistment movement is being carried out enthusiastically in various counties of the old liberated areas. The county committees of the Communist Party in Licheng, Zuoquan and other counties are calling on all party members, cadres, heroes, and liberated peasants in the county to bravely participate in the counter-offensive army. "Last winter we led the liberation, and today we lead the enlistment," "Steel must be used on the blade, and heroes must go to the front line!" "Fight to Nanjing, fight to Taiyuan, capture Chiang Kai-shek and capture Yan Xishan!" These resounding slogans have resounded throughout the vast countryside. Jia Fukuai, the labor hero of Tongan, led forty-two young men to join the army. Neiqiu County, which had produced a "Counter-Offensive Regiment" during the counter-offensive and surrender in 1945, and then continued to produce three batches of "Defend the Fruits Army" during the self-defense war, has now shouted out "We must establish a People's Anti-Chiang Counter-Offensive Regiment with poor and hired peasants as the backbone."
