　　At the Moscow Celebration of the Thirtieth Anniversary of the October Revolution
    Molotov Delivers Important Speech
    The Four Years of Patriotic War
    The fascist German invasion interrupted our peaceful period of constructive labor. Then began the four years of the Great Patriotic War, which was a supreme test for the Soviet Union, because, as Comrade Stalin so rightly said, it was "the most brutal and arduous war we have ever experienced in our history." We all remember the incredible difficulties our people went through in those years. It suffices to point out that Hitler occupied our territory with a pre-war population of 88 million, which produced 33 percent of the country's industrial production. The territory occupied by the Hitlerite bandits accounted for 47 percent of the total cultivated land in the Soviet Union, and almost half of our entire livestock industry was concentrated in this area. During the war, 1,300 factories—whose production was needed to meet the needs of the front and rear—were evacuated from the western and southern regions and regrouped in the east.
    The second period of Soviet history, including the years of the Great Patriotic War, more convincingly proved the increasing power and progressive strength of our multinational socialist state. Before the Soviet Union was involved in the war, Hitler acted as the master of Europe. Countries like fascist Italy became his obedient vassals, while other European countries like France succumbed to his iron heel due to the fascist baseness of their ruling groups. The territory of Great Britain, which foreign enemies had not set foot on for many centuries, was also shrouded in the most dangerous threat of German invasion. Only when the Soviet Union completed its war deployment, only when the Soviet Union transitioned to launching an offensive against the Hitlerite gang along the entire line, did the situation rapidly change.
    Another thing of great importance was the formation of the anti-fascist alliance of Allied countries, in which the Soviet Union occupied a leading position. All this guaranteed the defeat of fascism in Europe.
    As early as the twenty-seventh anniversary of the October Revolution (i.e., 1944), Comrade Stalin praised the merits of the Soviet people with a world-renowned saying, saying: "Today, as the Patriotic War is nearing its victorious end, the historical role of the Soviet people has been demonstrated in its full greatness. The whole world now recognizes that the Soviet people, through their selfless struggle, have saved European civilization from fascist barbarians. This is the great contribution of the Soviet people to human history." The recognition by all countries in the world that the Soviet people saved European civilization from fascist barbarians is also the recognition of the extraordinary merits of the communist leader and the great helmsman of the Soviet Union, Stalin. Our multinational Soviet state proved to be strong and indestructible in the face of all the tests of war. The Great Patriotic War more firmly united the Soviet nationalities than ever before to fight for the achievements of the October Revolution and for the happy future of our country.
    New Period of Post-War Development
   With the end of the war, the Soviet Union entered a new period of its development, since the beginning of last year, we have been working in accordance with the new post-war five-year plan. Comrade Stalin defined our new goal as follows: "The main objective of the new five-year plan is to restore the regions that have been ravaged in our country, to restore the pre-war level of industry and agriculture, and then to surpass this level by a considerable amount." The goals set by the Party and the government in restoring and developing the national economy encouraged our people to make new heroic efforts and labor achievements. Now, the entire country is inspired by the great voluntary: not only to complete but also to over fulfill the new five-year plan. At the beginning of the new five-year plan, agriculture suffered from drought, which spread to the most important agricultural areas last year. However, our country's ability to quickly overcome the economic difficulties it encounters is well known. This can also be proved by the fact that, thanks to the measures taken by the Party and the government, this year's grain harvest exceeded last year's by 58 percent. Last year—the first year of the post-war five-year plan—industrial production has achieved a substantial increase. However, since the restoration of industry, which has been converted to peaceful production, has not been fully completed, the plan was only 96 percent completed in industry last year. On the other hand, Soviet industry is now overfulfilling its plan this year. In the first three quarters of this year, industry has completed 103 percent of its nine-month plan. Our glorious Leningrad is now once again at the forefront. In October, Leningrad industry has completed and exceeded the entire plan for this year, the second year of the five-year plan, and the entire country is delighted with this. All this gives us reason to say that the unfulfilled part of the plan for the first year of the five-year plan (last year) will be made up for in the second year (this year), and the plans for the first two years of the five-year plan will be completed together by the end of this year. We are moving forward with confidence in industry, agriculture, and transportation, although we still have much work to do to heal the wounds and repair the damage caused by the war. We have mined more coal than before the war, but we have not yet reached the pre-war standards in restoring the production of the iron and steel industry and oil. The various departments of consumer goods and food industries are also being restored and developed. There is not a single industrial sector in our country that is not making great strides, nor is there a single industrial sector that is not planning to greatly increase production in the coming years. The Soviet government constantly cares about the adoption of new machines in all departments of industry, transportation, and agriculture. This is a reliable guarantee for the comprehensive progress of the socialist economy in the future. The quantity of industrial production is increasing month by month, and it is enough to say that in the past October, the output of our large-scale industry has reached the monthly average output of 1940. In other words, our industrial production has reached the pre-war level. This is just another proof that the conditions for rapidly improving the living standards of the entire people and further strengthening the strength of the Soviet state have been created in our country. We are not threatened by economic crises, which are so destructive to industry, and no capitalist country can escape them. There is no unemployment in our country, nor the poverty of the people that comes with unemployment, and there never will be. The Soviet system guarantees all opportunities for the continuous expansion of productive forces and the continuous improvement of the living standards of workers in urban and rural areas. This does not exist and cannot exist in any capitalist country.
    Comparison of the Soviet Union with Old Russia and European Capitalist Countries
    Compare old Russia with the Soviet Union created by the revolution.
    We know that bourgeois landlord Russia was defeated by Japanese imperialism in 1904-1905. We also know that Tsarist Russia has proven powerless to deal with and cannot resist William's army. Since then, the situation has fundamentally changed. The victory over German fascism in Europe and the subsequent defeat of the Japanese imperial army in Manchuria vividly demonstrated how far our country has advanced since the old Tsarist Russia. Attempts to revive and regenerate Russia failed in the 1905 revolution and the February Revolution of 1917. Only the Great October Socialist Revolution brought the long-awaited revival to our country and created the conditions for our strong revival. Only the Soviet revolution, the truly people's revolution, the revolution led by Lenin and Stalin's party, made our country the great and advanced power it is today. The greatness of the Soviet Union was created by the socialist revolution and is now recognized by all countries in the world. Is it not obvious? If the Bolsheviks had not succeeded in seizing power from Kerensky, the Mensheviks, the Social Revolutionaries, the Constitutional Democrats, and other servants of the bourgeoisie thirty years ago, our country might have lost its independence and might now be groaning in misery.

　　莫斯科十月革命三十周年纪念大会上
    莫洛托夫发表重要演说
    四年爱国战争时期
    法西斯德国的进攻，中断了我们建设性劳动的和平时期。接着就开始了四年伟大爱国战争的时期，这对苏联是一个至高无上的考验，因为正如斯大林同志所如此正确地说过的，这是“我们历史上从未经历过的最残酷、最艰苦的战争。”我们大家都记得，在那些年月里，我们人民经历了如何难以置信的困难。只消指出这一点就够了，这就是：希特勒占领了战前有八千八百万人口的我国领土，那里出产占全国工业生产量的百分之三十三。希特勒匪徒所占领的我国领土，其中耕地面积占全苏联总耕地面积的百分之四十七，我国全部牲畜业几乎有一半都集中在这块地区。战争期中，一千三百个工厂——前线与后方的必需品都需要它们的生产来满足——自西部与南部地区疏散到东部重新集结起来。
    包括伟大爱国战争年头的苏联历史第二时期，更加令人信服地证明了我们多民族社会主义国家的威力的提高与进步的力量。在苏联尚未卷入战争之前，希特勒在欧洲俨然以主人自居。象法西斯意大利之流的国家，成了他顺从的附庸，象法国等的欧洲其他国家，则因为统治集团的的法西斯的卑贱性，而屈服于其铁蹄之下。许多世纪来国外敌人从未涉足的英国领土，其上空也笼罩着德国入侵的最危险的威胁。只有当苏联完成了它战争的部署，只有当苏联沿全线过渡到对希特勒匪帮发动攻势的时候，形式才迅速改观。
    另一件具有巨大重要性的事情，是同盟国组成了反法西斯联盟，苏联在其中占了领导地位。这一切保证了法西斯主义在欧洲的败北。
    还在十月革命二十七周年时（按为一九四四年），斯大林同志曾经用举世皆知的名言，赞扬过苏维埃人民的功劳，他说：“今天，在爱国战争行将胜利结束的时候，苏维埃人民的历史作用已经在它充分的伟大性中表现出来。现在全世界公认，苏维埃人民以他们无我的斗争，从法西斯野蛮人手中拯救了欧洲文明。这是苏维埃人民对人类历史的伟大功劳。”在全世界各国目光中，承认了苏维埃人民从法西斯野蛮人手中拯救了欧洲文明这件事，也就是承认共产主义领袖与苏联伟大的舵手斯大林的非常的功勋。我们多民族苏维埃国家在全部战争的考验面前，证明是强大而不可摧毁的。伟大爱国战争比过去任何时候更加坚固地团结了苏维埃各个民族为十月革命的成果而战斗，为我们国家幸福的前途而战斗。
    战后发展新时期
    随着战争的结束，苏联进入了其发展的新的时期。自去年年初以来，我们就依照新的战后五年计划工作着。斯大林同志确定了我们的新目标如下：“新五年计划的主要目的，是恢复我国曾遭蹂躏的地区，恢复战前的工农业水平，然后相当大量的超过这一水平”。党与政府在恢复和发展国民经济中所规定的目标，鼓励了我们人民进行新的英雄主义的努力和劳动的业绩。现在，整个国家都被伟大的志愿鼓舞着：不仅要完成而且要超过完成新五年计划。新五年计划开始时，农业遭受了旱灾，去年的旱灾遍及最重要的农业区。然而，我们的国家迅速克服其所遭遇的经济困难的能力，是众所周知的。这又可以用下面的事实获得证明，即由于党与政府所采取的措施，今年的谷物收获量超过去年百分之五十八。去年——战后五年计划的第一年——工业生产已获得了大量的增加。可是，由于转入和平生产的工业复原尚未全部完成，去年的计划在工业方面只完成了百分之九十六。另一方面，今年苏联的工业则正在超过完成其计划。今年头三季中，工业已完成了其九个月计划的百分之一百零三。我们光荣的列宁格勒现在又走在前列，在十月份列宁格勒工业已完成并超过今年，即五年计划第二年的全部计划，整个国家对此都欢欣鼓舞。这一切使我们有根据说：五年计划第一年（去年）计划的未完成部分，将在第二年（今年）补足，而且五年计划头两年的计划将在今年年底一并完成。在工业、农业以及运输各部门，我们正满怀信心前进，虽然我们尚有许多工作要做，以治愈创伤并修复战争所造成的破坏。我们已开采了较战前更多的煤炭，但在恢复钢铁工业及石油的产量上，还没有达到战前的标准。消费品和食品工业的各部门也正在恢复和发展中。我们没有一个工业部门现在不是在大踏步前进，也没有一个工业部门不在计划今后几年内大大增加产量。苏维埃政府经常关心在工业、运输、及农业的一切部门采用新机器，这是社会主义经济此后全面进展的可靠保证。工业生产数量正在逐月增加，只要说这一点就够了：即在刚过去的十月份，我们大规模工业的产量已经达到了一九四○年的每月平均产量。换句话说，我们的工业产量已达到战前水平。这只是又一次证明了：在我们国家里已经创立了迅速提高全体人民生活水平和进一步加强苏维埃国家力量的条件。我们不受经济危机的威胁，经济危机对工业具有那么大的破坏性，而且没有一个资本主义国家可以幸免。我们国家没有失业，也没有随失业而来的人民的贫困，将来也绝不会有。苏维埃制度保证了生产力不断扩展和城乡工人生活水平不断提高的一切机会，这是在任何资本主义国家所没有，而且也不可能存在的。
    苏联与旧俄及欧洲资本主义国家比较
    把旧俄和由革命所创立的苏联比较一下。
    我们知道，资产阶级地主的俄国，在一九○四——一九○五年曾被日本帝国主义打败。我们也知道，沙俄已证明无力对付并且不能抗拒威廉的军队。自从那时以来，情势已根本改变。在欧洲战胜了德国法西斯主义与接着日本帝国军队在满洲的失败，生动地表显了我们国家自旧沙俄时期以来已经前进了多远。要使俄罗斯复兴与再生的企图，在一九○五年革命与一九一七年二月革命中都失败了。惟有伟大十月社会主义革命才带来了我国久已期待的复兴，并且创造了我国强大复兴的条件。惟有苏维埃革命，真正人民的革命，列宁与斯大林党所领导的这个革命，才使我国成了今天这样伟大与前进的强国。苏联的伟大是由社会主义革命创造出来，而且现在已为世界上一切国家所公认。难道还不明显吗？要不是布尔什维克在三十年前，从克伦斯基、孟什维克、社会革命党、立宪民主党与资产阶级的其他奴仆手中夺取政权获得成功，我国也许就会丧失独立，并且现在也许就会辗转呻吟在惨痛之中。（未完待续）
