Xinhua News Agency, East China, 3rd—Based on the "Speak Bitterness and Revenge" movement, the East China People's Liberation Army has launched a mass "Unity and Mutual Assistance" and "Kill the Enemy and Achieve Merit" campaign this year. Mutual assistance groups have been generally established in companies. A certain unit calls the mutual assistance group "The Strengths and Weaknesses Meeting," posing three questions: "What are your weaknesses that you need help with?" "What are your strengths that you can use to help others?" "How can we learn from each other's strengths to overcome our weaknesses and make progress together?" Some are called "United Hearts Meeting," "Revenge Meeting," etc. Soldiers with special skills are hired as instructors by the mutual aid groups. Many newly liberated soldiers voluntarily tell the PLA soldiers how they defended bunkers, fought battles, and built fortifications in the Kuomintang army, and they study combat methods together, greatly improving the efficiency of killing the enemy. In a long march of a certain regiment, due to the proposal of the mutual assistance and merit-seeking appeal, more than 300 soldiers with blisters on their feet did not fall behind, and a lot of civilian labor was saved. In the Fengshan battle, a certain unit successfully defended its position under the attack of nine enemy planes and more than a dozen artillery pieces. Platoon Leader Li Jingde was wounded twice, his arm was pierced, but he still insisted on commanding on the position. He said: "My merit plan stated: 'As long as I have a breath, I will not leave the front line.'" Slogans such as "Strive to be on the merit list" and "Strive for first place" have inspired the enthusiasm of soldiers, cadres, and the masses. Now, each company and each class has a democratically elected reporter of meritorious deeds, and the company has a merit evaluation committee. At the end of a battle or a task, a review and evaluation of merits is conducted at the meeting. Recently, the East China People's Liberation Army authorities have produced a large number of merit medals and People's Hero medals to award to the thousands upon thousands of meritorious people and heroes in the patriotic self-defense war.

    开展互助立功运动
    【新华社华东三日电】在“诉苦复仇”运动基础上，华东解放军年来开展了群众性的“团结互助”和“杀敌立功”运动，连队中已普遍建立了互助组，某部把互助组叫做“长短会”提出三个问题：“你有什么短处要人帮助？”“你有什么长处可以帮助别人？”“怎样来取长补短互相进步？”有的则叫“齐心会”、“报仇会”等。战士中凡有一技之长的就被互助组聘请为教员，许多新解放战士自动把在蒋军中守地堡、作战和做工事等办法告诉解放军战士，互相研究作战方法，大大提高了杀敌效率。某团在长途行军中，由于互助立功号召的提出，三百多个脚上打了水泡的战士都没有掉队，并节省了大量民力。峰山战役中，某部在敌人九架飞机和十几门大炮攻击下胜利的坚守阵地。排长李敬德两次负伤，胳膊打穿了，仍坚持在阵地上指挥，他说：“我的立功计划上说过：‘只要我有一口气就不下火线”。“争上功劳簿”，“争取第一名”等口号鼓舞了战士、干部群众的积极性，现各连各班都有民选的报功员，连队有评功委员会，在战斗或一项工作告一段落时，即在会上检讨评功。最近华东解放军当局已制成大批立功奖章及人民英雄奖章，奖给爱国自卫战争中成千成万的功臣和英雄。
