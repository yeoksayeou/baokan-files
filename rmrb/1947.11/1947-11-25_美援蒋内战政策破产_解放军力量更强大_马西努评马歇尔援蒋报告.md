Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 22nd: Moscow Radio broadcast Massinu's commentary on Marshall's report on aid to China on the 18th (Note: Marshall stated at a joint meeting of the U.S. Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committees on the 10th that the U.S. aid plan to Chiang Kai-shek was being drafted, and in response to inquiries, he stated that he would propose an estimated $300 million for aid to Chiang Kai-shek at the regular congressional session in January next spring). The commentary is as follows:

　　The reactionary Kuomintang politicians expressed a mixture of joy and disappointment at Marshall's report and its subsequent interpretations. They were joyful because they believed it was a spiritual boost to them, encouraging them to carry out the anti-people civil war. They were disappointed because the promise of continued aid given to them was still a vague promise. As for Marshall, he openly sided with the Kuomintang reactionaries, opposed the Chinese Communist Party, opposed Chinese democrats, deliberately made no comment on the recent anti-democratic measures of the Kuomintang, and no longer mentioned the so-called "broadening of the government base." All of this encouraged the Kuomintang reactionaries, making them believe that this was a formal endorsement of the widespread terror they were carrying out in their own areas of control—the brutal acts of killing and arresting patriots and destroying democratic organizations. The $425.2 million that the United States has already spent supporting the Kuomintang's civil war (according to figures released by the United Overseas Chinese Association for Peace and Democracy) has not defeated the People's Liberation Army, eliminated the Liberated Areas, or extinguished the democratic forces in China. As a result of two years of civil war and American intervention, the power of the Chinese reactionaries has only been further weakened, while the democratic forces have become stronger. While Marshall was making a report on continuing aid to Chiang Kai-shek, the People's Liberation Army occupied the important strategic railway hub of Shijiazhuang, a city with more than one million residents inside and outside. According to a broadcast from Handan Radio Station, the People's Liberation Army seized a large amount of grain, clothing, and ammunition here. On November 12, when Marshall answered questions from reporters at a press conference, he admitted the danger that American aid might fall into the hands of the Communists, which was certainly not accidental.

　　It is very obvious to everyone that the U.S. policy of aiding Chiang Kai-shek in the civil war has suffered bankruptcy. Even Marshall has to admit this point. He said that the Kuomintang's situation has "greatly deteriorated" and admitted that "the Chinese people are united with the Chinese Communist Party." It is of great significance to get this admission from people who completely deny that the CCP has the support of the people. Marshall stated that he would make another proposal to aid Chiang Kai-shek, but he still did not let members of Congress know about the Wedemeyer Report. The New York Herald Tribune wrote: Keeping the Wedemeyer Report secret is probably because the Kuomintang government has proven to be unable to militarily defeat the Communists. The Wedemeyer Report not only includes the results of the investigation, proving the bankruptcy of the U.S. policy of aiding the Kuomintang in the civil war, but also includes considerable recommendations that American imperialists are afraid to publish.

　　American journalists aptly call Marshall's aid plan to Chiang Kai-shek a "golden apple." The United States uses this "golden apple" to entice the Kuomintang. While using the "golden apple" to boost the morale of the reactionaries, they are using the Kuomintang's greater reliance on themselves to obtain greater future benefits (which they believe is a very cheap and profitable thing). The Truman Doctrine, first applied to China, has also first suffered bankruptcy in China. The new form of the Truman Doctrine, the so-called Marshall Plan, is also first concretely manifested in China. The Kuomintang recently signed three agreements with the United States: the agreement on the continued presence of U.S. troops in China, the relief agreement, and the agreement to establish the U.S.-China Education Foundation. These agreements show that the three aspects of the Marshall Plan, namely the three basic aspects that embody the external policy of the expansion of power by American reactionaries, are military strategic expansion, economic power, and cultural and ideological aggression. Whether in China or other countries in the East, or in all parts of the world, the United States is carrying out this policy. Therefore, it is not accidental that the issue of aid to Chiang Kai-shek is raised together with the so-called aid to Europe issue, because the United States wants to carry out world expansion and establish world hegemony, to turn all countries in the world into American colonies, and to make all peoples the slaves of the United States. However, the Chinese people, like the people of other countries, do not want to be slaves of American bankers and American monopolistic industrialists. Chinese patriots and democrats have the power to defeat the general offensive of American imperialist interference. The United States' encouragement of the Kuomintang to use terror and the threat of so-called American aid will never frighten Chinese patriots in the slightest. They believe that their own strength is sufficient to achieve final victory.

### 美援蒋内战政策破产　解放军力量更强大  马西努评马歇尔援蒋报告

　　美援蒋内战政策破产
  　解放军力量更强大
    马西努评马歇尔援蒋报告
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】莫斯科电台十八日广播马西努关于马歇尔援华报告的评论（按：马歇尔于十日美参众两院外交委员会联席会议中，声称美国援蒋计划正在拟订中，且在答复询问时称：将于明春一月国会常会中提出约略估计之三亿美元作援蒋费用）。评论如下：
    国民党反动政客对马歇尔的报告及其以后的解释，表示出欢乐和失望的混合情感，他们欢乐的是，因为他们认为这是对他们的精神援助，鼓励他们进行反人民内战。失望的是，因为约许给予他们的继续援助，仍然是一种含混不清的约许。至于马歇尔，则公开站在国民党反动派方面，反对中国共产党，反对中国民主份子，故意对最近国民党反民主措施不加评论，不再提什么所谓“扩大政府基础”的论调，这一切都鼓励了国民党反动派，使他们认为这是对于他们在自己统治区所进行的普遍恐怖——杀戮和逮捕爱国人士摧残民主组织的残暴行为之正式嘉许。美国支持国民党内战所已化掉的四十二万万五千二百万美元（据旅美华侨争取和平民主联合会公布数字），并没有打败解放军，消灭解放区，扑灭中国民主力量。两年内战和美国干涉的结果，中国反动派的力量只是更加削弱了，民主力量反而更加强大了。当马歇尔正在作关于继续援蒋的报告时，解放军占领了重要战略铁路中枢石家庄，这座城市内外有一百多万居民。据邯郸广播电台消息，人民解放军在这里缴获了大量的粮食、服装与弹药。十一月十二日马歇尔在记者招待会上答复记者所提的问题时，承认美国的援助有可能落到共产党人手中的危险，这当然不是偶然的。
    大家都很明显的看到：美国援助蒋介石内战的政策已遭受破产，连马歇尔也不得不承认这点，他说国民党情况已“大大恶化”，并承认“中国人民与中国共产党一致”，在完全否认中共得到人民拥护的人口中得到这种承认，是有很大意义的。马歇尔声明他将另外提出援助蒋介石的建议同时，却依然不叫国会议员知道魏德迈的报告书，纽约先锋论坛报写道：对魏德迈的报告保持秘密，大概是因为国民党政府证明已无力达到使共产党人的军事遭受失败。在魏德迈报告书中，不仅包括有考察的结果，证明了美国援助国民党内战政策的破产，而且还包括相当的建议，美帝国主义者害怕公布这些建议。
    美国记者恰当的叫马歇尔援蒋计划作“金苹果”。美国的这个“金苹果”引诱着国民党，他们用“金苹果”来提高反动派的欢乐的精神时，则利用国民党对自己的更加依靠，以取得将来的大利益（他们认为这是很便宜，有利润的事。）杜鲁门主义首先应用于中国，也首先在中国遭受破产。杜鲁门主义的新形式即所谓马歇尔计划，也首先在中国得到具体表现。国民党最近和美国签订了三个协定，即美军留驻中国的协定、救济协定和建立美国对华教育基金会的协定。这些协定表示出，马歇尔计划的三个方面，亦即体现出美国反动派扩张势力的对外政策的三个基本方面，即军事战略扩张、经济势力和文化思想上的侵略。无论在中国或东方其他国家中，无论在世界各地，美国都在进行着这种政策，因此与所谓援欧问题一起提出援蒋问题，并不是偶然的，因为美国要进行世界扩张和建立世界霸权，要把世界各国都造成美国殖民地，要各国人民都作美国的奴隶。可是中国人民和其他各国人民一样，不愿去当美国银行家和美国独占工业家的奴隶，中国爱国志士和民主派有力量击溃美帝国主义干涉的总进攻，美国鼓励国民党施用恐怖手段和用所谓美国援助的威胁，决不能把中国爱国志士吓唬住一丝一毫，他们相信他们自己的力量足够取得最后的胜利。
