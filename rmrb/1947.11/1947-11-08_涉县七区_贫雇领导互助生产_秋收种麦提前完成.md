    Shexian County Seventh District
    Poor and Hired Peasants Lead Mutual Aid Production
    Autumn Harvest and Wheat Planting Completed Ahead of Schedule

    [Our Newspaper Shexian County News] The Seventh District completed the autumn harvest and wheat planting in just half a month. A total of 556 auxiliary laborers (women), 229 old men, and 529 children participated in the harvesting and planting. Due to the participation of auxiliary labor, the campaign was completed ahead of schedule, with wheat planting covering 81% of the district's land. At the district-wide cadre meeting on October 28th, this work was summarized. The reasons for such great achievements and rapid completion are as follows, in addition to the driving force of a large number of auxiliary laborers: (1) Before the harvesting and cultivation, all villages in the district universally mobilized the poor and hired peasants, summarized the previous stage of production, and rectified mutual aid. In the rectification of mutual aid, it was discovered that landlords were counterattacking, and that in some villages landlords and middle peasants were serving as production cadres, exhibiting sabotage and selfishness. For example, Feng Baotai, an old middle peasant from Hezhang, served as the mutual aid team leader and embezzled 12.5 workdays within the team and sheltered landlords. Feng Baozhou privately distributed 20,000 yuan of dividends to him. Among the ten mutual aid team leaders in Duanqu, five were feudal rich peasants, two were landlords, two were old middle peasants, and one was dirt poor. After discovering these problems, the leadership supported the poor and hired peasants, allowing them to boldly expose the problems, re-elect the leaders, and mostly elect the poor and hired peasants. For example, in Dagang, 30 poor and hired peasants were selected to lead production in the villages. Also, before the campaign, help was given to the emancipated peasants to solve difficulties in the autumn harvest. For example, Taizhuang adjusted 34 sickles, 29 knives, and 290 jin of wheat seeds for the poor and hired peasants. Wherever this was done, they were very active in the harvesting and planting campaign. For example, in Hezhang, after the poor and hired peasants took power, they worked from dawn till dusk, rushing to harvest and plant. The village had 355 mu of grain, originally planned to use 355 workdays and complete it in five days, but it was completed in three and a half days, saving 108 workdays. The village completed the grain harvest earliest in the district. For example, Qingquan, an emancipated peasant from Tianjiazui, carried grain at night, influencing the entire village to carry over 200 mu of grain at night. Emancipated women in Huanglongkou harvested grain during the day and jointly rendered oil at night, rushing to make over 200 pairs of military socks. Conversely, villages such as Wenhe and Shitai, which did not focus on the poor and hired peasants, showed sluggish performance in the campaign. For example, in Shitai, some cadres sheltered landlords during the rectification of mutual aid, preventing them from leaving the team and allowing them to remain in the mutual aid team. In Wenhe, two landlords were treated as models in the autumn cultivation campaign. The masses said, "They were just struggled against, and now they have become models!" This greatly dampened the enthusiasm of the masses, and production was not energetic enough. (2) This year's harvesting and planting campaign developed relatively evenly, mainly because more than 40 strong village cadres, teachers, and district cadres were drawn from various villages to form a joint inspection team and dispersed to various villages (an average of three people per village). On the one hand, villages exchanged experiences with each other, and on the other hand, they directly helped with the autumn harvest, thus grasping the development and balance of the campaign. However, at the beginning, the ideology of the village cadres and the purpose of the inspection were not well resolved, causing them to feel depressed. For example, at the beginning, they could not find the key to the village, could not discover problems, and were afraid that if the work was done well, they would be promoted. Some comrades only focused on criticizing shortcomings, causing the village cadres to be dissatisfied with them. This lost the due role of the inspection. After discovering these problems, the leadership paid attention to timely resolution. The main focus was on concentrating everyone's opinions, summarizing the previous stage of experience, and clarifying that the purpose of the inspection was to learn from each other and overcome the simple focus on finding shortcomings; explanations were made regarding the fear of promotion. Secondly, the district cadres also changed their previous simple usage perspective towards their leadership, implemented specific assistance, boldly let them do things, and helped them summarize and improve. Only then did the work find its way, which was a very good practical exercise for the village cadres. (3) In this harvesting and planting, current affairs propaganda was universally combined, which greatly encouraged the masses' enthusiasm. In terms of propaganda forms, mainly quick talk, Yangko dance, and rice market streets were used, especially using maps for propaganda in the rice market. In the propaganda, the masses in Taizhuang proposed: "The army is winning victories in the front for us, and we in the rear should quickly harvest and plant to expand wheat fields and increase counter-offensive grain." They proposed intercropping wheat in cotton fields. The masses in Jiaokou reclaimed land on the river滩 to expand wheat fields by 20 mu, enough for next year's public grain. The masses in Baijiao said in the propaganda: "Our annihilation of the stubborn army is like harvesting grain, one piece less is one piece less, and no piece is no piece!" Chen Jigui said: "I heard the news of victory, and my energy is great. I want to speed up the autumn harvest and prepare to participate in the war!" Niu Yuhua's group became even more enthusiastic after hearing the news of victory. They organized ten laborers to plant land, planting seven mu a day, equivalent to three pairs of livestock, completing wheat planting ahead of schedule.

    涉县七区
    贫雇领导互助生产
    秋收种麦提前完成
    【本报涉县讯】七区经过短短的半月时间即完成了秋收种麦，计全区参加收种的辅助劳力妇女五百五十六个，老汉二百二十九个，儿童五百二十九个，由于辅助劳力的参加，使运动提前完成，种麦面积达全区土地百分之八十一。十月二十八号全区干部会上，总结了这段工作，所以有这样大成绩，而且完成又快，除大量辅助劳力的推动作用外，尚有以下几点：（一）在收耕前全区各村普遍发动了贫雇，总结了前段生产，整顿了互助。在整顿互助中发现了地主反攻及某些村庄是地主、中农担任生产干部，表现破坏和自私，如合漳老中农冯保泰担任互助组长，在组内贪污了十二个半工，并包庇地主，冯保州私自分给他红利两万元；段曲十个互助组长就有封建富农五个，地主两个，老中农两个，赤贫一个。发现这些问题后，领导上给贫雇撑腰作主，使他们大胆来暴露问题，改选了领导，大部选上贫雇。又如大港，选了三十个贫雇领导村里的生产。又在运动前帮助翻身农民解决了秋收中困难，如台庄给贫雇调剂了镰三十四张，刀二十九张，麦种二百九十斤。凡是经过这样做的，在收种运动中就表现很活跃，如合漳，贫雇掌权后，起早搭黑，抢收抢种，全村三百五十五亩谷，原计划用工三百五十五个，五天完成，结果三天半完成，省工一百零八个，该村收谷在全区完成最早。又如田家嘴翻身农民清泉，夜间担谷，影响全村夜间担谷二百多亩。黄龙口翻身妇女，白天进行割谷，夜间合伙并油，赶做军袜二百多双。相反，如温和、史邰等村没以贫雇为主，运动表现消沉，如史邰在整顿互助时，某些干部包庇地主不让地主出组，仍然留在互助组内。温和在秋耕运动中把两个地主当成模范，群众说：“才斗争了人家，又成了模范！”这样大大打击了群众情绪，生产不够带劲。（二）今年收种运动发展比较平衡，主要是从各村抽调出四十多个坚强的村干部和教员、区干部，共同组织成检查小组；分散到各个村里（每村平均到三个人），一方面村与村交流了经验，一方面直接帮助了秋收，这样掌握了运动的开展及平衡。但在开始对村干部思想及检查目的没有很好解决，形成他们苦闷。如开始到村里找不着门，发现不出问题，怕工作好了提拔自己，有些同志光扣捏缺点，形成该村干部对他不满，这样就失掉了检查应有的作用。发现这些问题后，领导上注意了及时解决，主要是集中大家意见，总结了前段经验，明确了检查目的是互相找好学好，克服了单纯找缺点；对怕提拔做了解释。其次是区干对他们领导上也转变了前段单纯使用观点，实行了具体帮助，并大胆放手让他们去干，并帮助总结去提高他们。从此以后，工作才找着了门径，这样对村干部是很好的一个实际锻炼。（三）在这次收种当中，普遍结合进行了时事宣传，对群众情绪有很大的鼓舞。在宣传形式上，主要用快板、秧歌、饭市街头等进行，特别是在饭市上利用地图宣传。宣传中如台庄群众提出：“军队在前方打胜仗是为咱们，咱们在后方应当快收快种扩大麦田，增加反攻粮。”提出棉花地串麦。郊口群众在河滩修地扩大麦田二十亩，够明年交公粮用。白茭在宣传中群众说：“咱们消灭顽军，好比割谷一样，割一片少一片没一片！”陈吉桂说：“我听了胜利消息，劲头大啦，要加紧秋收，准备参战！”牛玉花小组听到胜利消息更挂劲，组织十个劳力种地，一天种七亩，顶三对牲口，提前完成种麦。（之栋、前林、生伦、常英、银山、燕祥）
