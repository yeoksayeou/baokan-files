    Experiences in Transforming Old Performers
    Interview with Director Zhang of the Ji-Lu-Yu Folk Art Propaganda Team
    By Gao Zheng-an

    We arranged a discussion with the head of the propaganda team and representatives from various theater troupes. During the meeting, we freely exchanged information about the situations in both regions. Director Zhang of the Ji-Lu-Yu Folk Art Propaganda Team spoke at length about the experiences of transforming folk art, saying, "... It is necessary to inspire and transform folk art and old plays through the performers' ideological consciousness. The transformation of old performers must start with ideological consciousness, gradually move from emotion to politics, focus on one person to influence everyone, and follow the mass line, valuing and praising ordinary progress among them. By studying old plays and old stories, we can awaken their class consciousness." He also specifically introduced the transformation process of several old performers, such as the painter Gao Huailin, who had suffered decades of poverty and hardship. In the old society, he was considered a "good person." When he first came to the art department, he was unwilling to approach the leaders. Later, through the patient talks of comrades, he was drawn from emotion to political understanding. His thinking changed, and he realized that he had unintentionally been an accomplice of the landlord class for decades. Now, he has voluntarily broken his old habits and is determined to follow the Communist Party forever. Zhang Luzhen, a Zhuizi ballad singer named Feng Guilin, was initially very fearful of the cadres. When he came, he thought he would be detained and dared not bring anything. Later, after the cadres' warm reception and patient explanation, he untied the knots in his mind, got rid of his worries, and voluntarily brought everything, including his wife, treating the art department as his own home. Finally, he said that the folk art work in the Ji-Lu-Yu area is closely coordinated with the education departments of the government and the propaganda departments of the Party committee, from top to bottom, all the way to the districts and villages. Subsequently, Deputy Director Shen Guanying explained the characteristics of the old performers: first, selfishness and self-interest; second, undisciplined lifestyle; third, duplicity (saying one thing to your face and another behind your back). However, he also said: "Old performers are also poor people and were also an oppressed class in the old society. Today, we should promote and use their strengths, overcome and transform their old habits. Through ideological emancipation, they can also become a revolutionary artistic army."

    改造旧艺人的经验
    冀鲁豫民艺宣传队张主任谈
    高正奄记
    我们约了宣传队负责人和各剧团代表进行座谈，会上彼此尽情的交换介绍两地情况，冀鲁豫民艺宣传队张主任又畅谈改造民间艺术的经验，他说：“……必须启发和通过艺人的思想自觉，来改造民间艺术和旧剧，对旧艺人的改造，必须从思想自觉着手，由感情渐渐拉向政治，抓紧一人，影响大家，并须走群众路线，重视与表扬他们当中平凡的进步，通过研究扯旧戏、旧事，启发他阶级觉悟”，他又具体的介绍几位旧艺人改造过程，如画工郜怀林过去吃过几十年清肃，是在旧社会所谓“好人”初到艺术部时，对领导不愿接近，后来经同志们耐心谈从感情拉到政治认识，他思想转变了，认识到自己过去无意中作几十年地主阶级的帮凶，现在自动破了戒，决定永远跟共产党走。张禄镇说唱坠子艺人冯贵林，起初怎样对干部恐惧，来时认为一定会被扣，什么东西都不敢带，后来怎样经过干部热诚招待，耐心解释，现在解开思想疙瘩去了心病，自动带来一切东西和老婆，拿艺术部当成自己的家，最后他说冀鲁豫区的民艺工作，是和政权的教育部门，党委的宣传部门，从上到下，一直区村，紧紧的配合着，接着副主任沈冠英同志说明旧艺人的特点：一是自私自利，二是生活散漫，三是口是心非（当面一套，背后一套，）但他又说：“旧艺人也是穷人，在旧社会也是被压迫的阶层，今天应发扬使用他们的长处，克服和改造他们这旧习气，经过思想上的翻身，也是一支革命的艺术军队。”
