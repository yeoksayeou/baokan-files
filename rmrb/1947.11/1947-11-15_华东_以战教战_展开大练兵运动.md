Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 13th. Following the great victory at Jiaohe, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, amidst enthusiastic celebrations, launched a "Learning Warfare Through Warfare" training campaign to summarize combat experience, improve command skills, and further strengthen combat effectiveness. It began with commanders at all levels leading by example, conducting on-site exercises and research, and gradually promoting the practice. A certain regiment, once honored with the title of "Diamond Drill" by the late General Luo Binghui, conducted a large-scale exercise for all its cadres under the personal guidance of its leaders. They organized cadres at the platoon level and above into a company, with the regimental commander and deputy regimental commander serving as company commander and deputy company commander respectively, and the political director as the instructor. They adopted methods of "free guidance," "teaching while doing," "segmented exercises," and "joint exercises" to overcome and resolve practical difficulties in combat, correct actions, and improve the command capabilities of cadres at all levels. After conveying the hypothetical enemy situation and combat tasks, and after everyone spoke, the regimental commander unified command and began on-site exercises, which lasted for a full three days. After participating in the exercises and research, the commanders and fighters brought their acquired experience back to their units, further enhancing mass learning and mutual assistance. A certain division also assembled cadres at the company level and above, organized a company, and conducted a live ammunition exercise for one day. This exercise not only practically solved action problems in combat, but also provided further experience in how to conduct wartime political work and other tasks. The division used the experience gained from this exercise to educate the troops. A certain regiment, experienced and successful in attacking pillboxes, divided platoon and squad cadres to explain the tactics, treating the learning process as seriously as commanding a battle. After the exercises, combat reviews were conducted, with criticism, rewards, and punishments as appropriate. The regiment then used the acquired experience to guide the entire unit. In all the unit's exercises, a common feature was to first implement tactical command, adhering to the implementation of "Learning Warfare Through Warfare." This movement has now become a surging trend.

　　华东“以战教战”展开大练兵运动
    【新华社华东前线十三日电】胶河大捷后，解放军某部与热烈的庆功同时，开展“以战教战”的练兵运动，以总结战斗经验、提高指挥艺术与进一步加强战斗力。首由各级指挥员以身作则经过实地演习研究，逐步推广。曾经荣膺故罗炳辉将军授予“金钢钻”称号的某团，在首长亲自指导下，进行全团干部大演习。他们把全团班以上的干部编成一个连队，由团长副团长分任连长、副连长，由政治处主任指导员，采取“自由指导”、“边讲边做”、“分段演习”、“联合演习”的办法，突破与解决战斗中的实际困难，纠正动作，提高各级干部的指挥能力。该团长在传达假设敌情与战斗任务，又经过大家发言后，由团长统一指挥开始实地演习，一连进行了整整三天。参加演习研究后的指战员，把所得经验带到部队中去，使群众性的学习互助，更提高一步。某师亦集合连以上的干部，组织了一个连队，进行实弹演习一天。这次演习，不仅实际地解决了战斗中的动作问题，而且使如何进行战时政治工作及各项工作，有了更进一步的体验。该师就以这次演习的经验去教育部队。对子母堡攻击有经验有成绩的某团，以排、班干部分段讲解后，把学习看成指挥战斗一样，认真进行。演习后，进行战斗检讨，同样有批评、奖励、处罚。以所得经验，指导全团。在所有部队的演习中，有一个共同特点，即是先从战术指挥，贯彻“以战教战”的实施。此运动现已成为一种热潮。
