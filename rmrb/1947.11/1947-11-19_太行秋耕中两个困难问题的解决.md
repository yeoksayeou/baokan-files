Solving Two Difficult Problems in the Autumn Cultivation of Taihang
    *People's Daily* Reference Room

    As the saying goes, "Autumn is busy, autumn is busy, even the embroiderer gets out of bed." This year, we have early frost after spring drought and autumn floods, busy war support work, a lack of labor and livestock, and all kinds of life squeezed together, making it tense and difficult. In addition, this autumn has generally seen poor harvests everywhere. Therefore, after victoriously rushing to complete the second autumn harvest—planting wheat and harvesting autumn crops—and turning to autumn cultivation, we encountered resistance from the masses in terms of their thinking and specific difficulties. Those who solve these problems can victoriously complete autumn cultivation; otherwise, they will fall into laissez-faire.

    Breaking down the ideological obstacles among the masses in seizing the day and rushing to cultivate is the first hurdle to guaranteeing the victory of the movement. At the beginning of the movement, various muddled ideas were prevalent among the masses: some clung to narrow experience and waited for paralysis; some were confused by the greater profits of transportation and wanted to seize immediate gains to make up for losses; and some felt tired and wanted to rest. For example, the village head of Hetou Village in the Second District of Changzhi said: "If you want to make money from transportation, you'll miss the autumn harvest and the New Year. Autumn cultivation is not as good as engaging in sideline occupations." Wang He of Guguan only said when mobilized to plow the land: "We can only make up for the short with the long. Plow as much as we can. If we can't finish plowing this year, we'll plow it next year. Anyway, our place has never finished autumn cultivation since ancient times. Is it okay this year?" The village head of Zhuoma Village in the First District said: "My village has suffered a severe disaster. One mu only yields one or two dou, which is the same as not harvesting anything. My village has livestock, so we should hurry up and transport goods to earn money, leaving the stubble land to be plowed in the spring." He also said: "We must take care of the immediate problem. We can't transport goods." At the same time, everyone breathed a sigh of relief after the intense and busy autumn harvest and wheat planting. He Liansheng of Anyang Village in Ping Shun said: "The autumn harvest is finally over. It's really exhausting!" expressing a desire to rest. The Xia Dian Joint Defense in Xiangyuan found many paralyzing thoughts at the group leader joint meeting on October 16. Shen Niu of Fu Village said: "My group has little land and many livestock. The weather is still early. We can finish plowing no matter what." Wang Jinkui said: "There are still ten days until the Beginning of Winter. Even if the land is not turned over, we can catch up next spring." ... All kinds of muddled ideas must be used to enlighten the masses from the comparison of advantages and disadvantages and the calculation of time, so as to increase production and develop a positive desire to become rich, so that they can act consciously. First of all, let the masses understand that seizing the day and rushing to cultivate is to achieve intensive cultivation and lay the foundation for increasing production and getting rich and growing more grain next year, and use specific examples to illustrate the benefits of autumn plowing. For example, Gu Shun, the group leader of Liulinkou Mutual Aid Group in the Third District of Neiqiu, told everyone: "Last year, I lost eight mu of land because I didn't finish autumn cultivation. When sowing this year, it rained one day and we planted for one day. As a result, the land plowed by others all grew, but my eight mu were not sown even after two plantings. How much is the difference?" Gu Xiang then said: "Last year, I didn't do autumn cultivation on my six mu of land in Dongdadao. When sowing this year, others succeeded, but I didn't. As a result, others harvested three dou per mu, but my land didn't even yield two dou per mu on average." At the same time, specifically calculate the accounts, calculate the land, calculate the time, and calculate the livestock to break the masses' paralyzing thoughts of relying on the livestock to rest. For example, the Cao Linshui Brigade in Tianhe has a total of 676.3 mu of autumn land, and the entire brigade only has five teams of livestock. He said: "If we rely on these five teams of livestock to plow all these lands, we have to work non-stop for more than a month. However, 'when the Beginning of Winter brings light snow, the ground freezes like iron'. The ground will freeze soon, so we must organize manpower to seize the day and dig the ground." For the idea of emphasizing sideline occupations and neglecting agriculture and wanting to seize immediate gains, various places mostly use the question of what we rely on to turn over? Is it okay to rely solely on transportation? To enlighten the masses, and put forward ‘missing transportation is temporary, missing the plowing of land is for one year’ and ‘not plowing one mu will result in two dou of rice less’. The chairman of the Hetou Farmers' Association in Changzhi calculated more specifically, saying: "Last autumn, I only cared about transportation and earned more than one dan of rice, and more than 20 mu of land were not plowed. This year, I harvested more than two dan less because the grass was particularly large. I used more than 40 more workdays in a year, and also spent more than one dan in wages. It's really not worth it", which solved the masses' idea of underestimating autumn cultivation. In this way, starting from the interests of the masses, the seizure of the day and the rush to cultivate is truly transformed into a mass demand, and then rolled into the movement. For example, in Jiandu Village in the First District of Xiyang, after solving the ideological obstacles, the autumn cultivation movement entered a climax. 270 male and female laborers in the entire village were organized to carry out night plowing, and 28 mu of land were plowed in one night. In order to complete the autumn cultivation task ahead of schedule, Youren Village in the Third District organized 15 women and 12 children to pull plows to cultivate the land. Under the fighting goal of "not leaving one mu of stubble land this autumn," each village is rushing day and night. Facts have proved that in the movement, ideological mobilization must be implemented at all times, so that the masses' enthusiasm is full all the time, so that the autumn cultivation work can be completed without changing their breath.

    Secondly, solving the specific difficulties of poor and hired newly-emancipated households lacking livestock and not being able to afford wages is also an important issue in autumn cultivation. After entering autumn cultivation, generally, households with livestock and old middle peasants rely on their own livestock and do not worry about plowing the land, so they want to engage in sideline occupations to transport goods to earn money, or only take care of plowing for themselves, and are unwilling to plow for others, for fear of damaging the livestock. At the same time, in terms of equivalent value, transportation is more profitable than plowing. For example, Hao Xizhao of Liulin Village in the Second District of Xiyang said: "I really want to plow the land, but I ran for three or four mornings and couldn't find a single team of livestock, and I have to pay a large amount of wages. I calculated that plowing 20 mu of land would cost one dan of millet, which I can't afford." In addition, this year's poor harvest caused them to hesitate and wait and see about plowing the land due to concerns about high wages. Most areas have already broken through these difficulties. The methods in Xiyang are: 1. Carry forward the method of equal work for unequal work in the drought resistance, and exchange work for work (including manual labor for animal labor) to solve the difficulties of not having livestock and not being able to afford wages. For example, Beizhuang and Qianzhuang stipulated that two mu of land should be plowed (the standard for one person's耕地with two animals), and three workers should also be paid. If it is a household with no labor, the method in Liulin, Zuoquan is to use women to make a living by sewing clothes and making shoes to pay for work. At the same time, widely organize all the labor force of households without livestock to dig the ground. 2. Clear up old debts in mutual aid to solve the concerns of livestock-feeding households about suffering losses. 3. For those who want to transport goods to seize immediate gains, in addition to enlightening them ideologically to consciously cultivate the land, on the other hand, after the autumn cultivation is basically completed, a portion of the livestock power can be appropriately drawn out for transportation without hindering the plowing of the land. For example, the Wanglanke group in Jingyang has three sets of cattle and four sets of donkeys. When most of the land was plowed, it was calculated that it could be completed before the Beginning of Winter. The donkeys were divided into two groups, one group transported goods down the mountain, and the other group continued to plow the land, alternating them, and everyone was very satisfied. The method in the Seventh District of Zuoquan is to mobilize landlords to the mutual aid groups to plow the land for the peasants, not eating the peasants' food, calculating the wages according to the workload, and the landlord gets half of the wages, and the other half helps the military, cadres, martyrs' families, and poor and hired households, which also solves the difficulty of not being able to afford wages.

　　太行秋耕中两个困难问题的解决
    本报资料室
    俗话说“秋忙秋忙，绣女下床”，今年又是春旱秋涝下霜早，战勤工作忙，劳畜力缺乏，各种生活挤在一起，紧张艰苦，加以今秋各地普遍歉收，所以胜利的抢完二秋——种麦收秋，转向秋耕时，便遭到了群众思想的抵触和具体困难，解决了这些问题的，就能胜利完成秋耕，否则就陷于自流。
    打破群众抢天抢耕中的思想障碍，是保证运动胜利的第一关。运动一开始，群众中普遍存在着各式各样的糊涂思想：有的固守狭隘经验等待麻痹；有的迷惑于运输利大能抓现成补窟窿；有的感到疲劳想歇一歇。如长治二区河头村长就说：“想要运输赚钱，误了秋收过年，秋耕不如搞副业。”故县王和只在动员他犁地时他说：“咱这只能是长出短补，犁了多少算多少，今年犁不完明年再犁，反正咱这地方自古以来也没有秋耕完过，今年还行？”一区捉马村长说：“我村灾重，一亩只收一二斗和不收一样，我村有牲口赶快运输赚洋，撇下茬地春天再犁。”又说：“火烧眉毛顾眼前，不运输没办法。”同时，秋收种麦紧张繁忙过后大家松了一口气，平顺安阳村何连生就说：“秋可算收完了，真使翻啦！”表现出想歇一歇。襄垣夏店联防在十月十六日的互助组长联席会议上，发现了不少麻痹思想，傅村申牛的说：“我组地少牲口多，天气还早，不管怎样也能耕完。”王进奎说：“立冬还有十晌牛，就是垡不完明春也赶上”……所有各种糊涂思想，都须从对比利害计算时间上启发群众增产发家的积极要求，使其自觉行动起来。首先让群众明确了抢天抢耕是要做到精耕细作，为明年的增产发家多打粮打基础，并以具体事例说明秋垡地的好处。如内邱三区柳林沟互助组长谷顺告诉大家：“我去年丢了八亩地没秋耕完，今年养种的时候，一场雨一天种，结果挨着人家耕了的地都成了，我这八亩种了两回都没种上，这差多少呢？”谷香接着也说：“我东大道六亩地去年没秋耕，今年种时也是人家成了我没成，结果人家一亩地打三斗，我的地每亩连二斗也均不住。”同时具体算帐，算土地、算时间、算牲口，打破群众靠牲口歇一歇消停麻痹思想。如天河曹林水大队共秋地六七六．三亩，全队只有五犋牲口，他说：“靠这五犋牲口犁完这些地，一会不闲一直干，也得一个多月，可是‘立冬小雪地冻如铁’，不久地就要冻，所以必须组织人力抢天刨地才行。对于重副轻农想抓现成的思想，各地多用咱们靠啥翻身？光靠运输行不行？等问题启发群众，提出‘误了运输是一时，误了垡地是一年’，‘不垡一亩地少打二斗米’。长治河头农会主席更具体算帐说：“我去年秋天只顾运输，赚了一石多米，二十多亩地没犁，今年少收了二石多，因为草特别大，一年多用了四十多个工，又多出工资一石多，真不合算”，解决了群众轻视秋耕的思想。这样从群众利益出发，把抢天抢耕真正变为群众要求，进而卷入运动。如昔阳一区建都村，解决了思想障碍后，秋耕运动就进入高潮，全村男女劳力二百七十人组织起来进行夜刨地，一夜就刨地二十八亩。三区有仁村为了提前完成秋耕任务，组织了十五个妇女十二个儿童拉犁耕地，在“今秋不留一亩茬地的”奋斗目标下，各村都在夜以继日的突击。事实证明，在运动中必须随时贯澈思想发动，使群众情绪人人饱满时时饱满，才能不换气的把秋耕工作突击完成。
    其次，解决贫雇新翻身户缺少牲口和出不起工资的具体困难，也是秋耕中一个重要问题。进入秋耕后，一般有牲口户和旧中农自恃牲口多，不愁把地垡下，就想搞副业运输赚钱，或者光顾给自己耕，不愿给别人耕犁，怕把牲口使坏，同时在等价上运输比耕地利大。如昔阳二区柳林村郝喜兆就说：“我倒心想耕地，只是跑了三四个早上，连一犋牲口也寻不上，又得一大部工资，我算了下，耕二十亩地，就得出小米一石，咱出不起”。加以今年歉收，于是顾虑工资高犁不起，对耕地迟疑观望。大半地区都已突破这些难关，昔阳的办法是：一、发扬抗旱中等工不等价的办法，以工换工（包括人工换畜工），解决没牲口出不起工资的困难。如北庄、前庄规定垡二亩地（两头牲口一个人的耕地标准），还人工三个。如果是没劳力户，左权柳林的办法是以妇女做营生缝衣、做鞋来还工，同时广泛组织没牲口户所有劳力刨地。二、清理互助中的旧欠，解决喂牲口户的怕吃亏顾虑。三、对于想运输抓现成的，除了在思想上启发耕地自觉外，另一方面在秋耕大体完成，在不妨碍垡地的情况下，适当抽出一部分畜力搞运输。如静阳王兰科组，牛三套，驴四套，垡地垡到大半时，经过计算立冬前可以搞完，即将毛驴分成两伙，一伙下岭运输，一伙继续耕地，轮流调换，大家都很满意。左权七区的办法是，调动地主到互助组里给农民垡地，不吃农民饭，按活计工，算帐时工资地主得一半工资，另一半帮助军、干、烈属和贫雇户，这样也解决了出不起工资的困难。
