Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th. Moscow Dispatch: The Pravda published an editorial on the 6th, commemorating the 30th anniversary of the Great Socialist October Revolution, stating: The historical summary of the past thirty years is that it points out that socialism is insurmountable, and capitalism is rotten and destined to die; it points out that the capitalist economic system has gone bankrupt and can no longer be maintained for long, and it has to give way to another more advanced Soviet socialist economic system. Socialism has created a system without crises, without exploitation, and without national or racial oppression. It has become a reliable and solid fortress of democratic progress, and it has proven to be the only force capable of saving mankind from fascist enslavement and from returning to medieval barbarism.

The Soviet Union is commemorating the 30th anniversary of the October Revolution in an atmosphere of fighting for lasting peace and the victory of people's democracy after the war.

As a result of the war, several countries in Central and Southeastern Europe broke free from the shackles of the capitalist system, and they are laying the foundations for embarking on the road of socialist development.

The relationship between capitalism and socialism has undergone fundamental changes in favor of socialism.

The Soviet Union and the new democratic countries lead the anti-imperialist democratic camp against the imperialist camp headed by the United States. The most arrogant of the imperialist politicians are flexing their muscles and openly advocating launching "preventive wars" against the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries.

Extortionists and provocateurs intend to use these noises to scare the faint-hearted in order to obtain the concessions they expect.

However, these gentlemen may be forgetful. Let them recall the results of the anti-Soviet "crusade" organized by Churchill; let them recall the results of the "crusade" of Hitler's Germany and its vassals.

Now, our nerves are stronger, our strength has grown, and all progressive humanity stands with us. On our side are the oppressed nations in colonial and semi-colonial countries, whose national liberation movements are on the rise. On our side are also the democratic forces in various countries, including the democratic forces in the United States and Britain.

Gentlemen, extortionists, none of you can intimidate us, even if you use your "atomic diplomacy" and your "fifth column"—the right-wing "socialists" who sell out the interests of their countries and nations in exchange for a little leftover dollar scraps. We know that the strength of imperialism is declining day by day, and the ever-deepening general crisis of the capitalist system is exhausting it.

On the other hand, the forces of socialism and democracy are increasing in all aspects. This force is insurmountable and will inevitably make the plans of new war provocateurs completely collapse. For thirty years, the Soviet state has held high the banner of fighting for peace. All mankind cheers for our motherland, calling it a staunch peace standard-bearer and a reliable fortress for the security and true sovereignty of all countries.

Pravda concluded: The Soviet people look forward to the future of the motherland with courage and confidence. Under the banner of Lenin and under the leadership of Stalin, the Soviet people have entered the fourth decade of the October Revolution. The Soviet people are filled with unprecedented confidence in the victory of our great cause, and follow Comrade Stalin towards the victory of communism!

    在胜利旗帜下前进
    进步人类都与苏联站在一起
    新战争挑拨者必将全部崩溃
    【新华社陕北八日电】莫斯科讯：真理报六日发表社论，纪念伟大社会主义十月革命三十周年称：过去三十年的历史总结就是：它指出了社会主义是不可克服的，资本主义是腐烂透顶与注定了死亡的；它指出了资本主义经济制度已经破产，再不能长久维持，它不得不退让给另一个更高级的苏维埃社会主义经济制度。社会主义创造了没有危机、没有剥削、不知道民族或种族压迫的制度。它成了民主进步的可靠与坚固的堡垒，它业经证明是唯一有能力拯救人类免于法西斯奴役、免于回复到中世纪蒙昧主义的力量。
    苏联是在为战后的持久和平、为人民的民主胜利而斗争的气氛中，纪念十月革命三十周年的。
    战争的结果，若干中欧与东南欧的国家挣脱了资本主义制度的羁绊，它们正在安置步入社会主义发展道路的基础。
    资本主义与社会主义的关系，已有了有利于社会主义的根本变化。
    苏联与新民主主义国家领导着反帝国主义的民主阵营，反对以美国为首的帝国主义阵营。帝国主义政客中的最狂妄者，它们正磨拳擦掌，明目张胆的宣扬对苏联与新民主主义国家发动“预防性战争”。
    勒索讹诈者与挑拨者们打算用这些嚣嚷吓倒神经脆弱者，以取得他们所期望的让步。
    但是，这些绅士们也许是健忘的，让他们回忆一下邱吉尔所组织起来的十四国反苏“十字军”的结果吧；让他们回忆一下希特勒德国及其附庸们的“十字军”的结果吧。
    现在，我们的神经更为强健，我们的力量已经成长，整个进步人类都与我们站在一起。在我们这边的，有殖民地半殖民地被压迫民族，它们的民族解放运动已在高涨着。在我们这边的，还有各个国家的民主力量，包括美、英国的民主力量在内。
    绅士们，勒索讹诈者们，你们谁都恐吓不了，即使拿出你们的“原子外交”，你们的“第五纵队”——为博得一点美元的残羹剩饭而出卖他们国家民族利益的右翼“社会主义者”——也无济于事。我们知道，帝国主义的力量已日益衰微，资本主义制度愈益深重的总危机正在使它气尽力竭。
    另一方面，社会主义与民主的力量却在各方面增涨，这支力量是不可克服的，且必将使新战争挑拨者的计划全部崩溃。三十年来，苏维埃国家曾高举为和平奋斗的大旗，全人类欢呼我们的祖国，称之为坚定不渝的和平旗手，称之为各国安全与真正主权的可靠堡垒。
    真理报结语称：苏维埃人民满怀勇气与信心瞻望祖国的明日，在列宁的旗帜下，在斯大林的领导下，苏维埃人民进入十月革命的第四个十年了。苏维埃人民充满了对我们伟大事业的空前的胜利信心，跟随着斯大林同志走向共产主义的胜利！
