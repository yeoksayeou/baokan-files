　　The Battle to Capture the Strongly Fortified Stone Village Defense Line
  　Our Army's Superior Siege Techniques
    【Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji Front, 18th】Frontline reporters report: In the battle where the Jin-Cha-Ji People's Liberation Army broke through the strongly fortified defenses of Shijiazhuang, they demonstrated superior modern siege warfare techniques and overwhelming firepower against the Chiang bandits. The artillery fire and infantry movement were exceptionally accurate, displaying a high degree of organization in our army's operations. During the breakthrough of the bandit's Shiguo ring-city railway defense line on the 8th, the PLA unit responsible for the southwest corner assault, as it rushed towards the enemy's defense position, bombarded the enemy with dozens of large cannons continuously. Within minutes, the three major mother bunkers, six low bunkers, and eighteen bunkers of the Chiang bandits, each reaching 30 meters, were all destroyed by us, and half of the defending enemies were buried by the artillery fire. The main force then, under the cover of intense artillery fire, rushed over the outer moat and crossed the ring-city railway. Due to the close coordination of our various arms, the attacking troops suffered no casualties, while the "permanent and solid defense line" boasted by the Chiang bandits was swiftly breached by us in nineteen minutes. On the 10th, in the strong attack on the second defense line, the artillery fire once again displayed its power, with each target being destroyed upon impact. Soldiers began the strong assault in the smoke. After the breakthrough was opened, three assault teams advanced side by side, repelling several counterattacks by the enemy. Flying demolitionists used skillful movements to destroy the walls obstructing our army's advance, and our main force poured in continuously. The enemy's camp was immediately thrown into chaos, and our pursuing troops advanced directly towards the city center.
    【Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji Front, 17th】Frontline reporters reported on the Jin-Cha-Ji People's Liberation Army's battle to break through the Chiang bandit's inner Shiguo in Shijiazhuang: After the PLA unit broke through the first line of defense of the Chiang bandits from the east, west, north, and south on the evening of the 8th, they continued to advance towards the bandit's inner Shiguo. The PLA first captured the important town of Zhentou in the outer Shiguo on the southwest line. At 4:00 p.m. on the 10th, defying the enemy's dense artillery fire and the continuous bombing by eleven airplanes, they launched a general assault on the salient position of 200 meters between the 23rd and 24th bunkers of the Shiguo on that line. As the artillery roared, the Chiang bandit's forward power grid and shelters were completely flattened, and the surrounding fortifications immediately tended to soften. At 4:40 p.m., the PLA blasted gaps of one to two zhang wide in the outer moat of the West Barracks and the Small South Barracks, defended by the 96th Regiment of the Chiang bandit's 32nd Division. Our army then relied on scaling ladders and swarmed into the permanent defense works that the Chiang bandits had always boasted about. Our vast assault forces then broke into the urban area and engaged in fierce street fighting with the Chiang bandits, and directly pounced under the bandit's core fortifications.
