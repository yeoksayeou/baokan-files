　　【Taiyue, Our Newspaper, 22nd】In Yangcheng's Sixth District, the half-month autumn plowing plan was completed in ten days. The district has 76,582.94 mu of autumn land. With 2,709 head of livestock and 6,812 male laborers, it would take at least half a month to plow it all. However, because the poor and hired peasants were in power from the district to the village, and the guiding ideology was clear, it was completed ten days ahead of schedule. The newly established mutual aid teams are entirely controlled by the poor and hired peasants. For example, the mutual aid team led by poor peasant Zheng Guangying in Luqiang Village maintained high morale from beginning to end, unanimously proposing: "Don't let a single animal rest, don't let a single person be idle." They plowed all 315 mu of autumn land of the team in nine days, and also hoed stubble on 20 mu and bundled grass on 62 mu. All old mutual aid teams also squeezed out feudal elements from their leadership. Landlord Liu Wenyi of Chai疙瘩 was originally a team leader but was squeezed out, and when poor peasant Cheng San'die took over the leadership, autumn plowing immediately became vigorous, completing the plowing of all 200 mu of land in the team within ten days. On the other hand, many difficulties in autumn plowing were overcome through the creation of hired-and-poor peasant methods. Li Zhi, the production team leader of Jide, saw reports advocating human-powered plows and boldly used one, plowing nine fen more per day than a head of livestock. This promoted and increased the confidence of all the poor and hired peasant leaders. Dozens of villages such as Hujia and Xiazhuang widely adopted this method, improving the efficiency of autumn plowing. Therefore, the entire district completed the half-month plan in ten days. The masses happily said: "In the past, we only talked and didn't do anything practical. This year, all the autumn land is plowed. Look how good it is!"
　　【Taiyue, Our Newspaper, 22nd】Relying on hired and poor peasant leadership, the "Sanqiu" (Autumn Harvest, Autumn Planting and Autumn Plowing) campaign in Yanshan, Yangcheng, ended ahead of schedule. With a large number of laborers supporting the front line, the village still had 195 male full and semi-laborers and 341 women. It was estimated that there would be great difficulties in the "Sanqiu" campaign, but under the leadership of the poor and hired peasants and Party members, unexpectedly, all 3,885.2 mu of autumn fields, 1,143 mu of wheat fields, and 2,879.3 mu of autumn land in the village were quickly harvested, sown, and plowed in 36 days. On September 17th, Party member and labor hero Shangguan Zhongyou, on behalf of the branch, proposed a plan to attack the "Sanqiu" campaign to all the farmers. Party members Shangguan Qingyun and Li Yuying, who came from poor and hired peasant backgrounds, immediately proposed to take the lead in the "Sanqiu" campaign, ensuring that their squads would complete the harvest in six days. One after another, the poor and hired peasants and Party members made various guarantees and implemented a system of recording points based on the amount of work done, with increases for those who harvested more and decreases for those who harvested less. That afternoon, everyone went out and first harvested the crops of the military dependents and the families of martyrs, as well as the civilian laborers participating in the war. Every time they reached a field, they swept it like autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves, and it was harvested in a short time. On the first day, Shangguan Xuanzhi, a seventeen-year-old girl, harvested grain relatively slowly and was credited with six points of work in the evening. She was so angry that she cried and said, "Wait and see tomorrow!" Sure enough, the next day, she didn't say a word in the field and harvested quickly and well, earning full points that night. Li Yuying, a female Communist Party member, forgot the pain of the sores on her chest and got up in the middle of the night to urge everyone to go to the fields, harvesting three mu of millet by daybreak. Liu Xiaoniao, a female Communist Party member of the second squad, led nine women to get up even earlier and harvested four and a third mu of millet by daybreak. Under the leadership of female Communist Party member Niu Xiaoxiang, the third squad harvested even faster, harvesting five and four-tenths mu of millet by daybreak, including Wang Yugui, a woman who got up in the middle of the night and went to the field with a torch. In total, the women completely harvested all 3,885.2 mu of autumn land in eleven days. The men were equally tense. Communist Party member Shangguan Yinkui took the lead, carrying manure with three dung buckets, launching the "three-bucket manure carrying movement." Poor and hired peasants such as Liu Zhuazhu, Yan Xinjin, and Shangguan Yindui, unable to find dung buckets, used large buckets carried by livestock to transport manure. As a result, of the 10,700 large and small loads of manure in the village, manpower carried more than 7,000 loads. The old men in charge of plowing also did not lag behind. All 1,143 mu of wheat in the village were sown in eight days. Jiu Chuan's mother, who was over forty years old, saw the old man going to spread manure, took the plow and plowed two mu of land. In total, the village's ninety-one head of livestock, in addition to carrying manure, plowed and sowed an average of more than 1.57 mu per head per day. Following the call of the village branch, autumn land was also generally plowed. From October 23rd, over the next seventeen days, 2,879.3 mu of land were plowed. Each head of livestock plowed an average of 1.86 mu of land per day. The masses all said with a smile, "It's the first year that the land has been plowed so clean!" As for the various difficulties in the "Sanqiu" campaign, they were all resolved in a timely manner. For example, twelve households lacked seeds, and the poor and hired peasants and Party members, led by Shangguan Zhongyou, lent 1 shi 1 dou and 1 sheng of wheat. There was also no fertilizer on nine mu of land, so the mutual aid brigade sent more than 500 sheep to lie down on the land.

　　阳城六区贫雇领导秋耕
  　半月计划十天干完
    【本报太岳二十二日电】阳城六区，半月秋垡计划十天完成。全区秋地七万六千五百八十二亩九分四，以两千七百零九犋牲口及六千八百十二个男劳动力算，至少半月才能垡完，但因由区到村贫雇当权，领导思想明确，即提前十天完成了。新成立的互助组完全贫雇掌权，如吕强村贫雇郑广英领导的互助组，自始至终情绪高涨，一致提出：“不歇一头牲口，不闲一个人。”九天即垡完全组三百一十五亩秋地，并刨茬二十亩、捆草六十二亩。所有老的互助组亦从领导成份中挤封建。柴疙瘩地主刘文义，原是个组长，即被挤出去，由贫农成三爹领导，马上就轰轰烈烈秋垡起来，十天内垡完了全组二百亩地。另一方面，由于雇贫生法创造，克服了秋垡中的许多困难。吉德生产队长李智，看到报上提倡人拉犁，即大胆使用一张人拉犁，每天比一犋牲口多犁九分。由此推广提高了所有雇贫领导信心，护驾、下庄等数十村普遍采用这办法，提高了秋垡效率，所以，全区半月计划十天完成，群众高兴的说：“常年光说不实干，今年秋地全垡完了，你看多好！”
    【本报太岳二十二日电】依靠雇贫领导，阳城岩山三秋提前结束。在大批劳力支援前线下，全村尚有男全半劳力一百九十五人、妇女三百四十一人，估计三秋中有很大困难，但在贫雇及党员的带头下，出乎意外的全村三千八百八十五亩二分秋田、一千一百四十三亩麦田及二千八百七十九亩三分秋地，在三十六天中迅速收割、下种、垡完。九月十七日，党员劳动英雄上官中有，代表支部向全体农民提出突击三秋的计划后，贫雇出身的党员上官卿云、党员李玉英等即提出在三秋中要积极带头，保证自己的分队在六天中收割完毕。接二连三的，贫雇与党员都提出了各种保证，并实行按人记分，多割者增，少割者减，当天下午，全体出动，大家首先下手收军干烈属及参战民工的庄稼，每至一块田里，好似秋风扫落叶，一会就割完了。第一天，十七岁的闺女上官宣枝割谷较慢，晚上记了六分工，便气得大哭一场说：“看明天吧！”果真，第二天到地里一句话也不说，割的又快又好，当晚得到了满分。女共产党员李玉英，忘记了胸部的疮痛，半夜便起来吆喝大家上地，赶天明便收割了三亩谷子。二分队女共产党员刘小鸟，更带领九个妇女起得早，赶天明就收割了四亩三分谷子。三分队在女共产党员牛小香的带领下，全分队收割的更快，赶天明就割了五亩四分谷子，其中妇女王玉桂，半夜起来点着火把上地。总计妇女们在十一天中便将三千八百八十五亩二分秋地完全收割清。男人亦同样的紧张，共产党员上官银奎带头，以三个粪桶担粪，展开“三桶担粪运动”，雇贫如刘抓住、燕辛金、上官引堆等，找不上粪桶，就用牲口驮的大桶担粪。因此，全村一万零七百担大小粪，人力即担了七千余担。掌犁的老汉也不落后，全村一千一百四十三亩回茬麦，在八天中即全部下种。酒川妈年已四十多岁了，看见老汉去撒粪了，便掌着犁就犁完了二亩地。共计全村的九十一犋牲口，除驮粪，每犋平均一天连犁带种一亩五分七厘多。在该村支部的号召后，秋地也普遍的垡过。从十月二十三日起，前后十七天中，垡完二千八百七十九亩三分地，每犋牲口平均一天垡地一亩八分六厘，群众都笑着说：“真是头一年，把地垡的这样净！”至于三秋中的各种困难，也都得到及时解决，如十二户缺种籽，以上官中有为首的贫雇及党员，便借出一石一斗一升麦子，还有九亩地内没有粪土，互助大队就派五百余只羊去卧地。
