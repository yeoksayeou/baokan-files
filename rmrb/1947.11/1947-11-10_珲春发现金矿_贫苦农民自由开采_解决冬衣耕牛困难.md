    Hunchun Discovers Gold Mine
    Impoverished Peasants Freely Mine
    Resolves Difficulties with Winter Clothing and Oxen
    (Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 3rd) A gold mine was recently discovered in a certain area of Hunchun County, Jilin Province. The ore layer is extremely shallow and easy to mine. In order to eliminate poverty and solve the difficulties of the masses with winter clothing and plowing livestock for next spring, the democratic government decided to organize impoverished masses to mine, and all the gold mined belongs entirely to the masses. Currently, the masses from various districts of the county and neighboring Wangqing, Dongning, and other counties are flocking to pan and mine. At its peak, there were three to four thousand people. On average, each person can mine five li of gold per day, with the maximum being one li and one fen and eight li. As of now, each person has earned an average of over 150,000 yuan (equivalent to 2 million Chiang currency). The masses participating in gold mining have not only solved the problem of winter clothing this year, but also each household will have an ox for plowing next spring.
