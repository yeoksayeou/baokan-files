    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: New York dispatch: The movement launched by American democratic forces to abolish the "House Un-American Activities Committee" is flourishing and has achieved an initial victory. In addition to the previously reported protest meeting by 2,000 prominent figures in American literary circles and two mass rallies in New York, Georgia also held a protest meeting of 2,000 people on October 27, despite threats spread in advance by reactionaries. Kingdon, Vice Chairman of the American Progressive Citizens Association, and black leader Robeson delivered speeches at the meeting, fiercely attacking the "Un-American Activities Committee" for its infringement on American human rights. In addition, several representatives of famous playwrights and writers from New York went to Washington in batches on October 29 and November 1 to appeal to public opinion against the activities of the committee, demonstratively participated in the committee's "investigation and trial" of Hollywood stars, and spoke with some members of Congress, asking them to support the bill to abolish the "Un-American Activities Committee" in the upcoming Congress. On October 31, a group of writers and critics in Washington issued a statement urging Americans to oppose the committee's activities, and denounced the committee's "anti-communist" tactics as "competing with Nazi strategies." Nineteen Hollywood stars (including the ten writers and directors recently accused by the committee of "contempt" of Congress) simultaneously published a statement in the newspaper, exposing that the existence of the committee endangers every free group. President Murray of the CIO published in the newspaper his letter to congressional leaders, denouncing the committee's activities as representing "a kind of thought control, which was characteristic of the police states of our enemies." Under strong attacks from all sides, the committee was forced to announce on October 30 the suspension of the "investigation and trial" of Hollywood stars. The Progressive Citizens Association specially published a public statement in the newspaper, claiming that the committee's suspension of the "investigation and trial" of Hollywood artists is a temporary victory for this movement, and what will follow is a comprehensive victory, that is, the complete abolition of the "Un-American Activities Committee."

    美民主运动获初步胜利
    暂停“侦审”好莱坞影星
    【新华社陕北五日电】纽约讯：美国民主势力所发动的取消“众院非美活动委员会”的运动，正在逢勃展开，并已取得了初步胜利。除前已报导的美国文坛名流两千人抗议大会及纽约的两次群众大会外，乔治亚域亦于十月廿七日不顾反动派事先散布之威胁，举行两千人的抗议大会，美进步公民协会副主席金登及黑人领袖罗伯逊，均在会上发表演说，猛烈攻击“非美活动委员会”对美国人权之侵害。此外，纽约的著名演剧家，作家代表多人，于十月二十九日及本月一日分批赴华盛顿呼吁舆论界反对该委员会活动，示威地参加该委员会对好莱坞影星的“侦审”，并与一些国会议员交谈，要求他们在行将到来之国会中，支持取消“非美活动委员会”的议案。十月三十一日，华盛顿一批作家及批评家发表声明，敦促美人反对该委员会的活动；并斥该委员会之“反共”伎俩是“与纳粹策略进行竞赛。”好莱坞影星十九人（包括最近被该委员会指为“轻蔑”国会的十位作家与导演在内），同时在报上发表声明，揭露该委员会之存在，危及每一个自由团体。产联主席莫莱在报上公布其致国会领袖之函中，斥该委员会之活动，代表“一种思想控制，这曾是我们敌人的警察国家底特色”。在各方强烈攻击下，该委员会被迫于十月三十日宣布暂停对好莱坞影星之“侦审”。进步公民协会为此特在报上发表公开声明，声称该委员会对好莱坞艺人的停止“侦审”乃是这次运动的暂时胜利，随之而来的将是全面的胜利，即彻底取消“非美活动委员会”。
