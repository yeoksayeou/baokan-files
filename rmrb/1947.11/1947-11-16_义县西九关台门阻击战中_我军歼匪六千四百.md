Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 14th: In the阻击战 (Zu Ji Zhan) near Jiu Guantai Gate in Yixian County, the Jicha Rehe Liaoning People's Liberation Army annihilated and captured 6,477 enemy soldiers of the 21st Division of the 92nd Army of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang on the 2nd (the previous report mistakenly stated over 3,000). Detailed battle results are supplemented as follows: The enemy's Deputy Division Commander of the 21st Division, Li Chuanzong, was killed; the enemy's Commander of the 60th Regiment of the 21st Division, Chen Shou Gong, and the Deputy Commander of the 67th Regiment, Yu Zhen, and other officers and soldiers numbering 3,372 were wounded; the Division Commander of the Division, Guo Huicang, the Chief of Staff, Ji Gaoxiang, the Commander of the 63rd Regiment, Lai Tian, and other officers and soldiers numbering 3,105 were captured; and a large number of various guns, cannons, and military supplies were seized.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 14th: Frontline reporters Ge Yuan and Shan Qiao reported on the fleeing of the enemy troops during the pursuit and annihilation battle on the Daling River in western Liaoning, stating: The bandit leader Hou Jingru fantasized about "seizing Chaoyang to relieve the siege of Beipiao" and "this is our first battle out of the pass, and if we fight well, the position of the 92nd Army will be greatly improved." On the evening of October 29th, he personally led the "elite" 21st Division of the army and the 43rd Division of the 94th Army, dividing into two groups and advancing westward along the railway and highway from Yixian County. However, like other henchmen of the Chiang Chen bandit gang, he became frightened and hesitated to move forward as soon as he sneaked to the Jiuguantai Gate area, thirty or forty miles west of Yixian County. At 3 a.m. one morning, our army launched an attack on the invading enemy. By the morning of the 2nd, the two divisions were completely compressed into a narrow strip of land less than twenty miles long and less than ten miles wide. Our vanguard pursuit troops were only three or four miles away from Hou Jingru's military headquarters and the 21st Division's headquarters. Seeing that the situation was not good, Hou Jingru quietly took a battalion and a guard squad, abandoned the 21st Division and the 43rd Division, and slipped away. Unexpectedly, when he ran to the Daling River, the jeep got stuck in the sand and could not move. Hou Jingru had to seize a horse and flee in panic. When the 43rd Division learned that the army commander had deserted, they also turned around and left. By the time the 21st Division wanted to escape, it had already been surrounded by our pursuing troops. The 21st Division of the American-equipped 92nd Army, which Chiang Kai-shek had personally praised for being "prepared for war at all times and defending every place," was completely annihilated and captured except for one battalion that escaped. At that time, the commander of the 21st Division, Guo Huicang, led a group of defeated soldiers and desperately fled eastward. On the banks of the Daling River, they abandoned more than 20 cars, more than 100辎重 (zīzhòng) vehicles, and two榴弹炮 (liúdàn pào), but our soldiers did not even look at these spoils of war and pursued them fiercely across the river. Under the slogan of "Capture Guo Huicang alive," they chased for more than ten miles, finally surrounding Guo Huicang and his guard company tightly in Hejia Xinzi. Squad leader Ren Shuqi and Qiu Hongming, a soldier who had just been liberated from Chaoyang, chased the enemy into a courtyard and threw grenades into it. Squad leader Ren shouted, "Surrender and be spared! We will treat prisoners kindly!" A large stubborn enemy soldier desperately stuck his head out from inside the wall and shouted for mercy, saying, "Sir, we will definitely surrender!" Another cunning enemy took the opportunity to throw out a grenade, and Squad Leader Ren, Qiu Hongming, and Tian Hui were all wounded. All the enemies took this opportunity to escape over the wall. Ren, Qiu Hongming, and Tian Hui chased closely despite their injuries. Just as they were about to leave the village, another unit of our army rushed to meet them, and the enemy was surrounded again. After a burst of gunfire and shouts, Li Fuzong, the deputy division commander of the 21st Division, was killed, and the division commander Guo Huicang was captured alive.

　　义县西九关台门阻击战中
    我军歼匪六千四百
    【新华社东北前线十四日电】冀察热辽人民解放军二日在义县九关台门附近歼俘蒋匪九十二军二十一师达六千四百七十七名（前报误为三千余名），详细战果补充如下：毙匪二十一师副师长李传宗，伤匪二十一师六十团团长陈寿恭、六十七团副团长于振相等以下官兵三千三百七十二名，俘该师师长郭惠苍、参谋长纪高翔、六十三团团长赖惕安以下官兵三千一百零五名，缴获各种枪炮及军用物资甚多。
    【新华社东北前线十四日电】前线记者戈原、山桥报导辽西大凌河追歼战中，敌军狼狈情形称：匪首侯镜如幻想着“夺取朝阳，解团北票”和“此次是我们出关的第一仗，若打得好，九十二军的地位将大大提高”，于十月二十九日晚亲率该军“精锐”二十一师和九十四军的四十三师，由义县沿铁路公路分两股西进，但他也和其他蒋陈匪帮的爪牙一样，刚刚窜到义县以西三四十里的九关台门一带，就胆战心惊，龟缩不前了。一日晨三时，我军对侵犯之敌发动攻击，二日晨即将两师完全压缩于长不及二十里、宽不及十里的一条狭长地带内，我先头追击部队距侯镜如军部及二十一师师部仅三四里，侯镜如一见大势不妙，就悄悄带着一个营和卫士班，仍掉二十一师和四十三师拔腿溜掉了；那知跑到大凌河，偏偏吉普车陷入沙滩里一动也不动，侯镜如只得夺马落荒而逃。四十三师得悉军长临阵脱逃，便也扭头就走，等到二十一师也想急窜逃命之时已被我追击部队四面包围了。蒋贼曾经亲口夸奖过的“无时不备战，无地不设防”的美械化九十二军二十一师，除跑掉了一个营之外，就都全部被歼俘了。当时二十一师师长郭惠苍带领一部分残兵败将拼命向东乱窜，在大凌河畔丢掉二十多辆汽车，一百多辆辎重车和两门榴弹炮，但我们的战士们对这些战利品看也不看的，越河猛追，在“活捉郭惠苍”的口号下，一直追了十几里，终于在和家信子把郭惠苍和他的警卫连紧紧包围，班长任树齐和朝阳才解放过来的战士邱洪明等把敌人追到一个院子里，用手榴弹打进去，任班长大喊“缴枪不杀，我们优待俘虏”，一个大个子顽军狼狈的在墙内伸出头来大喊饶命说：“老爷，我们一定缴枪！”另一个狡猾的敌人却乘机扔出一个手榴弹，任班长和邱洪明，田惠都挂了花，所有的敌人便乘此越墙而逃，任班长和邱洪明，田惠乃负伤紧追，将出庄子，我另部大军迎面赶来，敌人又陷重围，一阵枪声喊声后，二十一师副师长李傅宗被击毙，师长郭惠苍也就被活捉了。
