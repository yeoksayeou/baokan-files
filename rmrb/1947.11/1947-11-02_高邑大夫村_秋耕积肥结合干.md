Gaoyi News: Daifu Village in the first district held a meeting of mutual aid team leaders and poor peasant employees on the evening of the 24th to discuss how to carry out autumn plowing and manure collection. First, they started with ideological mobilization and discussed the benefits of autumn plowing, which raised everyone's spirits. Shi Heijian and others said, "Now that we have land after turning over, we must take good care of the crops. Autumn plowing will nourish the land, and next year the seedlings will definitely grow well. Let's quickly organize the labor and livestock to plow! After we finish plowing early, we can organize sideline transportation." Someone suggested: some small donkeys can't pull the plow. Liu Fuqing and others said, "If anyone's small donkey can't pull, we can assign someone to help pull." Someone else suggested: how can some peasants who have been liberated and have no livestock do the work? Liu Huanwen and others said, "We liberated peasants are one family. If the land isn't plowed, we won't be able to harvest more grain next year. If we fall behind for one year, we will fall behind for several years. Whichever team finishes plowing first can go and plow for them, and we can provide meals." When discussing how to combine autumn plowing with manure collection, Liu Fuqing and others said, "Now is the time to collect manure. If we miss this period, it won't be available. We can now get up every morning to collect leaves, hoe weeds, and compost manure, and then go to plow the land after breakfast." After everyone's enthusiastic discussion, challenges were proposed at the meeting. The entire village has twenty-five mutual aid teams and currently has seven hundred and thirty mu of stubble land, excluding flower stubble. Starting from the 25th, they guarantee to finish plowing within five days and combine it with manure collection, ensuring that neither task is neglected.

    秋耕积肥结合干
    【本报高邑讯】一区大夫庄村二十四号晚召开了互助组长以上干部及雇贫会议，研究秋耕积肥如何进行，首先从思想发动，把秋耕有啥好处，讨论了一下，大家情绪很高，首先有史黑艰等说：“咱今天经过翻身有了地就得好好养种，秋耕了养垧，明年一定长苗好，咱们赶快把劳畜力组织起来耕吧！早耕完好组织副业运输。”有人提出：有的小驴拉不动犁。刘福庆等说：“如果谁的小驴拉不动，可配一个人拉。”又有人提出：有些翻身户没有牲口怎样干呢？刘焕文等说：“咱们翻身农民是一家，不把地耕了，明年还多打不下粮食，一年赶不上，几年都赶不上，咱们那个组先耕完了就给他们去耕，可管饭。”讨论到秋耕如何结合积肥，刘福庆等说：“现正在积肥的时候，过了这个时期就不沾了，咱现在可以每天早晨起来先去搂树叶、锄草、沤肥，饭后去耕地。”经过大家热烈的讨论，当会纷纷提出挑战。全村二十五个互助组，除花茬以外现有七百三十亩茬地，从二十五号起，五天内保证耕完，并要结合积肥两不误。
