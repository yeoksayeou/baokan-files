Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th—According to various sources, the anti-hunger movement of workers in the Chiang-controlled areas is developing in various places. Employees of the Peiping Public Bus Company frequently staged work slowdowns due to meager pay. On the 13th of this month, the slowdown reached its peak, with only one of the sixty buses running on the city's five routes. Workers at the Tangshan Huaxin Textile Factory, after their request for the full distribution of flour as a form of in-kind allowance was rejected by the factory under various pretexts, began a slowdown on the afternoon of the 24th of last month, achieving initial success by the 25th. In mid-last month, lower and middle-level staff from the six mines under the Kailuan Mining Bureau (Tangshan, Linxi, Zhao Ge Zhuang, Ma Jia Gou, Tang Jia Zhuang, and Qinhuangdao) held a meeting of representatives in Tangshan to resist the Chiang bandits' mine authorities' refusal to increase monthly coal rations and improve benefits. The Tangshan mine also launched a signature campaign on the 25th of last month. According to the person in charge of the staff representatives, they vowed not to give up until their goals are achieved. Furthermore, the strike by workers at the Chiang bandit naval shipyard in Qingdao is expanding. The Chiang bandit chief of the shipyard, terrified by the workers' momentum, has fled to Shanghai in a panic. The workers also rejected the "mediation" and deception of Li Daifang, the speaker of the Chiang bandit-controlled municipal council, stating that they would not resume work until their goals are achieved. According to a United Press report from Shanghai on the 26th, workers at the Huamei Silk Factory in Shanghai have gone on a general strike and punished the foremen. The Fuxing Tobacco Company broke out in a strike a few days ago and is still persisting.
