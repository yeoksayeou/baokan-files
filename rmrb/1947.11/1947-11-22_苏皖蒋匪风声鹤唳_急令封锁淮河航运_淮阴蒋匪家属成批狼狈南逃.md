Xinhua News Agency, East China, 20th: According to comprehensive reports from various sources: Under the victorious shock of the counter-offensive army, the Chiang bandits in Jiangsu and Anhui are extremely panicked. The Chiang bandits in Hefei have promulgated "emergency defense measures," strictly ordering citizens to store three months of food. The Chiang bandit Anhui Provincial Government has built protective trenches and ordered the closure of the Huai River shipping. The liners between Bengbu and Zhengyangguan have been suspended, and mail is also being delivered by manpower. The Chiang bandits along the Grand Canal and in the cities of northern Jiangsu are extremely nervous, with rumors spreading everywhere that "the Eighth Route Army is coming to take the city." The Chiang bandit Jiangsu Provincial Government has instructed all Chiang family commissioners and county chiefs "not to leave their posts without authorization." The Chiang 4th Reorganized Division headquarters has moved to Baoying to strengthen river defenses. Zhang Xuezhong, director of the Chiang bandit "Huaihai Pacification Zone," urgently ordered the increase of the city wall by two feet in Huaiyin, where the Pacification Headquarters is located, and requisitioned all vehicles. Currently, families of Chiang family officials in the city are fleeing south in panic in batches. In the cities of Siyang, Shuyang, Lianshui, and Baoying, curfew begins every day at 3 or 4 p.m., and the number of sentries on the streets and alleys has increased from one to four or five. The Chiang County Government of Siyang issued a notice "prohibiting discussion of current affairs, and violators will be punished according to law." However, citizens are still spreading news of the victory of the People's Liberation Army's counter-offensive. The Chiang bandits in Lianshui are digging tunnels, burning torches high at night, firing guns to embolden themselves, and organizing Chiang family agency personnel into "armed teams" to stage a fake troop increase farce in an attempt to stabilize morale. However, Chiang currency is still plummeting, and its exchange rate with silver dollars has increased from 25,000 yuan to 35,000 yuan.

    【新华社华东二十日电】综合各方来讯：在反攻大军胜利震慑下，苏皖蒋匪恐慌万状。合肥蒋匪已颁布“紧急防御措施”，严令市民存储三个月食粮。蒋匪安徽省府内构筑掩护壕，并下令封锁淮河航运，蚌埠、正阳关间班轮已停驶，邮件亦改由人力挑送。运河沿线及苏北各城市蒋匪风声鹤唳，到处流传：“八路军要拿城”。蒋匪江苏省府督令各蒋家专员、县长“不得擅离职守”，蒋整四师师部已移至宝应，图增强河防。蒋匪“淮海绥靖区”主任张雪中急促该绥署所在地之淮阴，加高城墙二尺，并征用全部汽车，刻城内蒋家官员家属成批狼狈南逃。宿迁、沭阳、涟水、宝应各城市，每日下午三、四时即开始戒严，街巷岗哨已由一人增至四五人。泗阳蒋县府布告“禁谈时事，违者依法论处”。但市民仍纷纷传说解放军反攻胜利消息。涟水蒋匪挖掘地道，入夜即高烧火把，鸣枪壮胆，并编练蒋家机关人员为“武装队”，扮演假增兵丑剧，以图稳定人心。但蒋币仍狂跌不已，其与银元兑换率已由二万五千元增至三万五千元。
