　　[Reported by our newspaper in Xingtai] In order to compensate for the poor harvest, the cadres and masses of Yangfan Village in the Fifth District actively discussed ways to find a solution. Shunji Flower Shop was the first to propose that since there were no flowers this year, they should switch to spinning wool. This would promote the sale of local products (wool) and the finished products would earn wages. What the district couldn't use could also be exported. After the decision was made, various streets began to pool shares to open woolen yarn factories. From November 6th to November 16th, a total of 2,800 jin of finished woolen yarn was produced in ten days. At a net profit of 1,000 yuan per jin, a total of 2.8 million yuan could be earned. In ten days, livestock earned over 100,000 yuan. There were 120 male laborers who regularly worked in the wool factories, including 60 who had left production. The treatment was the same as in the cooperative. The remaining 60 people earned 500 yuan each per day. There were 200 female laborers who spun regularly, with the most productive spinning two jin a day and the least productive spinning twelve liang. On average, each person earned 450 to 1,000 yuan per day, solving all the family's petty cash difficulties. Currently, women throughout the village are spinning wool day and night. According to calculations over ten days, a total of 920,000 yuan in wages was earned. Now, the whole village's wool spinning movement is in full swing. Not only did the masses earn money, but the wool that the trading company had stored for the previous three or four years was turned into bleached woolen yarn and could all be sold. Recently, four more carts were purchased and will be put into operation immediately. In total, Yangfan Village earned 3,885,500 yuan in ten days (excluding other transportation costs). According to current market prices, this could buy 77 shi of millet. (Yun Xuan)
