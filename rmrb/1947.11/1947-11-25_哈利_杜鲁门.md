　　Harry Truman
    Soviet Union Guo'erbatov
    　　　　(I)
    On September 1st of this year, a man arrived in Rio de Janeiro. This man liked to wear bow ties and trousers that were about two inches shorter than normal. Otherwise, there was nothing particularly remarkable about his appearance. He had a pale, Baptist-like face, which gave the airbrushers at "Life" magazine a lot of trouble. Everyone knew that he was the most ordinary of ordinary Americans, the most rural of Missourians.

    If people were received according to their status and real worth, no one would have paid attention to this man who came to Rio de Janeiro. However, due to a strange twist of fate, this small figure was the President of the United States. Therefore, the residents of Rio de Janeiro were ecstatic. The music of the honor guard sounded, colorful ribbons and confetti flew in the streets, and large portraits of US President Truman and Brazilian President Dutra were hung on major buildings. Their portraits were hung together, appearing to smile. If you recall that Truman had recently liked to call himself a good student of President Roosevelt, and Dutra had been honored with the Arrow Cross of Hitler and the Medal of Mussolini, then this situation is particularly touching.

    On September 2, President Dutra led President Truman to attend the Inter-American Conference. Truman, like a rural pastor, stammered as he read his speech. This speech was, as usual, written for him by Coraco Clifford. In the speech, Truman explained his "policy," saying that he was dissatisfied with the post-war peace and Europe. Speaking of Greece, he could find some comfort, but the new democratic countries made him very uneasy. He made certain attacking remarks against the Soviet Union, although he did not mention the name of the Soviet Union, saying just like Churchill's empty shots: "The United States is determined to maintain its military strength."

    But what kind of person is this imperialist Protestant? Americans like to say that in their democracy, anyone can be president. One does not need titles or money to be president, only the ability to govern the country. But what kind of talent did Truman rely on to become president? What talent did this short and corrupt Missourian have that made him stand above millions of Americans and reside in the White House alone?

    Truman was born in the countryside in 1884. In school, he did not show any special talent, but he was diligent and able to follow the rules and regulations. His conduct was upright and he could be called a model. He often wore glasses and was a very steady child. Not a "Tom Sawyer" but a well-mannered, taciturn "Sid." (Tom Sawyer and Sid are the two main characters in the book "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer" by the famous American writer Mark Twain. The former is a smart, brave, and adventurous child, while the latter is a pampered, timid, and unpromising child - Editor.) After graduating from high school, he wanted to enter the West Point Military Academy, but he failed to pass the entrance examination because of poor eyesight.

    He was good at playing the organ in his youth, but because of a lack of musical talent and thinking ability, he failed to become a musician.

    So he worked as a clerk in a bank, earning a salary of twenty-five US dollars a week. He was very satisfied with his fate and believed that it was the happiest period of his life, without any hope.

    In April 1917, he was drafted into the army. During his military service, he did not show any miracles of bravery. He was just a dutiful artillery captain.

    After retiring from the army, he returned home, got married, and opened a cloth and grocery store in Kansas City. He was somewhat incompetent in this business, which went bankrupt, losing all his own and others' capital. It took him thirteen years to pay off his debts. After failing in business, he decided to gamble his luck in politics.

    It is said that in 1922 he was a member of the Ku Klux Klan (the Ku Klux Klan is an armed secret rogue special agent organization in the United States that opposes blacks and democracy - Editor), but he now firmly denies this. According to reliable sources, he was a member of the Freemasons and also a Democrat.

    The master of the Democratic Party in Kansas City was Tom Pendergast. Needless to say, this was a very prominent man. He could sway elections. He had led the party's election organization, which was the most publicly corrupt in history. He could make ghosts and gods vote for him. He included people who had died long ago and people who had never existed on earth on his voter list. Of course, these people voted according to his will. After a party wins an election, all government officials in a state, from the governor to the post office branch director, are replaced. These positions are all controlled by Tom. Tom sold official titles and appointed governors, senators, and judges. Truman was also appointed by Tom.

    Without Tom Pendergast, Truman would never have been promoted. Tom Pendergast first assigned him a small job, sending him to be a road inspector, with a daily salary of five US dollars. Later, Truman used machines to clear the mud on the road. Afterwards, Tom selected him to be a judge in Jackson County.

    After serving in this position for eight years, Truman asked Tom to assign him a higher-paying position. He intended to be a tax collector, but Tom was a very humorous man, so he decided to make Truman a senator.

    Tom said: "I am willing to confirm that if our organization is well organized, we can send a menial to the Senate as a senator."

    Tom's organization was indeed well organized. In 1934, under Tom's supervision, Truman won the election in three districts with 40,812 votes. This menial entered the Senate. From then on, the people of the United States called Truman Tom's "menial."

    Ten years later, the entire situation of this election was revealed. According to the results of the investigation, in the district where Truman obtained 40,000 votes, only 25,000 people had the right to vote, and 15,000 were Tom's ghosts and gods. However, Tom had long been lying in the grave, while Truman was safely residing in the White House. After entering the Senate, Truman blindly obeyed Tom's orders. The most prominent thing about him in the Senate was his silence. In the first three years, no one heard him speak. He only spoke when defending Tom. At that time, his master Tom, because of poverty, openly committed illegal acts and was imprisoned. Truman did everything possible to save his master.

    By the time of the 1942 election, this menial no longer had a master, and the ghosts and gods could no longer vote for him. He faced the danger of failure. At that time, he felt his own insignificance and helplessness. He looked around pitifully and finally found a new master. This master was Robert Hannegan, the son of a Missouri policeman, whose reputation was very bad. People called him "the most untrustworthy master in the most untrustworthy political group." Hannegan became Truman's master, and he instigated Truman's two opponents to compete with each other in order to divide their votes and help Truman re-enter the Senate. Truman was elected with a very small number of votes.

    After Truman re-entered the Senate, he immediately thanked his master and, against public opinion, recommended him as the tax collector of St. Louis. Hannegan was promoted very quickly. A few years later, he became the chairman of the Democratic National Committee and the leader of the secret and powerful "Tammany Hall" (Tammany Hall is the Democratic Party headquarters in New York, and also a notorious election manipulation organization. - Editor) presidential promotion association. This master played a decisive role in the election of Truman as vice president.

    This is how the little menial's official position was created: obedience to the master - that is the ability to govern the country. Truman really has this talent. His obedience, flattery, willingness to faithfully serve his master, and ability to please the masters of Wall Street finally enabled this small Missourian to enter the White House.

    　　　　(III)

    In July 1944, a very fierce election struggle broke out at the Democratic National Convention. There was no doubt that the presidential candidate was Roosevelt. The undecided question was who could be the vice-presidential candidate.

    The progressive camp led by Roosevelt and the reactionary camp led by the Southern Democrats stood in opposition to each other. The reactionaries demanded a re-examination of Roosevelt's economic program, the abolition of price controls, and the recognition of white supremacy and the privileges of the Southern states. Their candidate was Byrnes, while the progressive camp's candidate was Wallace. Roosevelt supported Wallace. (To be continued)

　　哈利·杜鲁门
    苏联  郭尔巴托夫
    　　　　（一）
    本年九月一日，里约热内芦地方来了一个人，这个人喜欢带领结，喜欢穿比普通短二英寸左右的裤子，其余外表再没有什么特点。他有着一付苍白的浸礼教徒一样的面孔，这给“生活”杂志的修像人添了很多的麻烦。一般人都知道，他是普通美国人中最普通的一个人，是密苏里州人中最土的一个人。
    要是按身份和实际价值来接待人的话，那么对于这位来到里约热内芦的人，将没有一个人去注意了。但是，由于命运的奇怪捉弄，这个小小躯干的人，竟是美国的大总统。因此里约热内芦地方的居民，便狂喜的了不得，仪仗队的音乐响了，大街上彩花和纸片纷飞，各大建筑物上悬挂着美国大总统杜鲁门和巴西大总统杜特拉的大型肖像，他们的肖像悬挂在一起，并现出微笑的样子。如果你回想一下杜鲁门在不久前即喜欢自称为罗斯福大总统的好学生，杜特拉曾荣受希特勒的箭十字章、及墨索里尼的勋章时，那么这种情况是特别令人感动的。
    九月二日，杜特拉总统领杜鲁门总统出席泛美会议。杜鲁门好象农村的牧师似的，支支吾吾的念起演说词来。这个演说词照例是由科拉科·克里佛尔德给他作的。在演词中，杜鲁门解释了他的“政策”，说他不满意战后和平及欧洲，若说希腊，还能给他点安慰，但新民主主义各国却使他非常惶惑不安。他对苏联发表了某些攻击的言论，虽然未提出苏联的名字，完全和邱吉尔放空矢一样的说：“美国决意保持其军事实力”。
    　　　　（二）
    但是这个帝国主义的新教徒究竟是一个什么样的人呢？美国人很喜欢说，在他们的民主国家里，每个人都可以当大总统。当大总统并不需要爵位和美金，只要有治国的才能就可以。可是，杜鲁门凭那一种才干当了大总统呢？如此躯干短小而又腐败的密苏里人究竟有什么才能，他为什么超乎千百万美国人之上而独处于白宫呢？
    杜鲁门一八八四年生于农村，在学校时，他未显出特别才能，但是很勤勉，还能循规蹈矩，品行端正，可称模范。他常常带着眼镜，原是一个很稳重的孩子。不是一个“汤姆·索也尔”而是一个很有教养的寡言笑的“席德”。（“汤姆·索也尔”与“席德”是美国名作家马克吐温所著“汤姆索也尔”历险记一书中的两个主角，前者是一个聪明、勇敢和富于冒险性的孩子，后者是一个娇养怯懦没出息的孩子——编者。）中学毕业以后，他想入维斯特堡军官学校，但是因为目力不佳，未能考入。
    他少年时代擅长风琴，但是因为音乐才能不足，思考力缺乏，以致未能成为音乐家。
    于是他便在银行充当书记，每星期领到二十五块美金的薪俸，他很满意自己的命运，认为那是他一生最幸福的时期，并未有任何希望。
    一九一七年四月，他被征入伍，在兵役中，他也没有表现出任何勇敢的奇迹，他不过是一个安份守己的炮兵上尉而已。
    退伍后归家结婚，在堪萨斯城开了一个布匹杂货店。这种事业，他有点不能胜任，以致倒闭，把他自己和别人的本钱全亏进去了。经过十三年以后，他才把债务还清。在商业方面失败以后，他就决意在政治上一赌幸运。
    据说，一九二二年他是三Ｋ党（三Ｋ党是美国反黑人反民主的武装的秘密流氓特务组织——编者）的党员，但是他现在坚决否认这个事情。据确实消息，他入过秘密共济会，同时还是一个民主党员。
    堪萨斯城内民主党的主人是汤姆·彭德尔喀士特。不用说，这是一个很显耀的人。他能左右选举，他曾领导过该党的选举机构，这个选举机构在历史上是最贿赂公行的。他能使鬼神为他投票，很久以前死去的人和地球上根本未生存过的人，他都列入他的选民名单。当然，这些人都遵照他的意旨来投票。在选举中，一个党得到胜利以后，一个州里的政府官吏，由州长至邮政分局长，全部更换。此类职务，都操在汤姆的手里。汤姆卖官咀爵，委任州长、参议员和推事。杜鲁门也是由汤姆委任的。
    如果没有汤姆·彭德尔喀士特，杜鲁门是永远不能升官晋级的。汤姆·彭德尔喀士特先委了他一个小差事，派他为道路监察员，每日薪金五块美金。再后，杜鲁门即用机器去清除道路上的泥土。嗣后，汤姆选他为杰克逊地方的推事。
    杜鲁门担任此职八年以后，请求汤姆派他一个收入较多的职任。他打算充当收税官，但汤姆是个很幽默的人，他决定叫杜鲁门当参院的议员。
    汤姆说：“我愿意证实一下，就是如果我们的机构整顿得好，我们可以派一个夫役到参院当议员的。”
    汤姆的机构到底是整顿好了。一九三四年在汤姆监督下，杜鲁门在三个选区内，获得了四○八一二张票而中选。这个夫役就入了参院。从那时起，美国全国人民就称杜鲁门为汤姆的“夫役”了。
    十年以后，这次选举的全部情形才被揭露出来。据调查的结果，杜鲁门获得四万张票的那个选区，仅有二万五千人有选举权，一万五千人则是汤姆的神鬼。但是，汤姆很早就躺在坟墓里了，而杜鲁门却安然的居在白宫里。入参院以后，杜鲁门盲目的遵从着汤姆的命令。他在参院最突出的一点，就是默不发言。在最初三年中没有一个人听他说过话。仅仅在维护汤姆的时候，他才发了言。那时他的主子汤姆，因为贫困，公然作出违法的行为，因之被囚在狱中。杜鲁门尽了一切的可能，拯救他的主子。
    到一九四二年选举的时候，这个夫役已没有主人，神鬼也再不能为他投票了。他面临着失败的危险。那时，他才觉得自己的渺小无靠。他以诉苦的样子向四方眺望，终于找到新主子了。这个主子是劳别特·汉尼根，他是密苏里州一个警察的儿子，他的名誉很不好，人们都把他叫作“一个最没信用的政治团体里的最没有信用的主人。”汉尼根成了杜鲁门的主人，他唆使杜鲁门的两个对手互相竞争，以分散其选举票数而帮助杜鲁门重入参院。杜鲁门获得了极微的票数而当选。
    在杜鲁门重入参院后，当即感激他的主人，并违背着舆论，推蔗他为圣路易的征税吏。汉尼根被提升的很快，数年后他竟成为民主党全国委员会的主席兼秘密而有力的“塔马尼大厦”（“塔马尼大厦”为民主党总部在纽约之会址，亦为秽声四溢的选举操纵机关。——编者）总统促成会的领导人。这个主人在选举杜鲁门为副总统上，曾起着决定的作用。
    这个小夫役的官职是这样造成的：对于主人的驯从——就是治国的才能。杜鲁门委实具有这种才能。他的唯命是从，阿谀逢迎，永远准备为主人忠实服务，并能使华尔街的主子开心的本事，终于使这个小小的密苏里州人，进入白宫。
    　　　　（三）
    一九四四年七月，民主党代表大会上爆发了极激烈的竞选斗争。总统候选人为罗斯福，这是毫无疑义的事情。争论不决的问题就是谁可以做副总统候选人。
    以罗斯福为首的进步阵营和以南方民主党为首的反动阵营，互相对立起来。反动派要求重新审查罗斯福的经济纲领，要求废除物价管制并承认白种人的优越地位和南方各州的特权。他们的候选人为贝纳斯，进步阵营的候选人为华莱士。罗斯福是支持华莱士的。（未完）
