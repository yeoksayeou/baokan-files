Xinhua News Agency, Eyuwan Front, 20th. Correspondent Wang Kuang reports: Since September, the People's Liberation Army has liberated most of western Anhui. To date, the people of western Anhui have established democratic governments in Dushan, Lu'an, Lihuang, Huoshan, Shucheng, Shu(cheng)-Lu(an), Yuexi, Tongcheng, Huxi (west of Chaohu Lake), Tong(cheng)-Lu(jiang), Qianshan, Qian(shan)-Huai(ning)-Taihu, Susong, Wangjiang, Huoqiu, and Yingshan. The People's Liberation Army has controlled hundreds of miles of the Yangtze River shoreline from Wangjiang to Wuhu, echoing the armed forces of southern Anhui across the river. The People's Liberation Army has obtained a forward base here for heading south to Jiujiang and east to Nanjing and Wuhu. Western Anhui is located at the southeastern end of the Dabie Mountains. Huoshan, Yuexi and other places were once the base areas of the Red Army during the Soviet period. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the New Fourth Army persisted in resisting Japan in western Anhui; after the Southern Anhui Incident, it persisted in the struggle against Chiang Kai-shek's "encirclement and suppression." No matter how the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang ravaged and oppressed them, the people of western Anhui still persisted in the struggle. When the People's Liberation Army arrived, the masses' emotions were even higher. According to Comrade Yu Yichuan, who worked among the masses in the Taihang area for many years, the people of western Anhui are in high spirits for the struggle for emancipation, and the momentum and scale of the movement are much greater than when it started in the Taihang area. When the People's Liberation Army annihilated the 60th Brigade northwest of Huoshan, the people of Yuexi automatically organized 300 stretchers and thousands of laborers to go to the battlefield. The people of Huoshan, Tongcheng, and Lu'an actively found ways to shelter the wounded and posted sentries, almost like in the old liberated areas of North China. After the wealth and grain of local tyrants and evil gentry were distributed, the masses actively reported hidden Chiang Kai-shek spies and detectives to the democratic government. When Chiang Kai-shek's army "encircled and suppressed" and robbed grain in western Anhui on October 1, the masses arrested and took away the local bullies first, and then launched guerrilla warfare everywhere. The masses generally proposed: "Distribute grain, clothing and money first, and then divide the land when we have food and clothing." Nearly one million people have now begun to participate in the land reform movement. In villages of all sizes, hundreds and thousands of peasants are meeting to express their grievances and celebrate their emancipation. The land reform movement is like a raging fire, burning everywhere in western Anhui.

　　The peasants of western Anhui have suffered heavy oppression in the past, first from landlords and gentry, second from county, township, and bao-jia authorities, and third from Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army. For example, in the lease relationship, several counties had an "two-eight rent split", where the landlord took 80% of the harvest and the tenant farmer took 20%; there was even an "one-nine rent split". In addition, tenant farmers also had to provide labor to the "master" to carry sedan chairs, and give extra exploitation such as sending chickens and ducks during the New Year and festivals. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Chiang Kai-shek's army occupied western Anhui, and the county and township chiefs were all from Guangxi. The three things they generally did were: first, conscript soldiers, then recruit policemen, and seize civilian houses. The common people regarded them as worse than the Japanese invaders. When Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army's 46th Division fell into Huoshan, all the women inside and outside the city who failed to escape were raped. Eight young girls hiding in the mountains near Yushudian were chased by the bandit army and had nowhere to escape, so they jumped into a pool. The bandit army used gun barrels to push their heads to the bottom of the water, drowning them alive. The poor people of western Anhui, who have suffered many disasters, now have a slogan: "Barefoot men and paupers, take the lead in the emancipation movement!"

　　Most of western Anhui is mountainous, with crisscrossing mountains and overlapping peaks, making the terrain very dangerous, which is very different from the mountains in the north. There are many forks in the mountains. For example, Yuexi County has plains as wide as dozens of miles, rich in grain and cotton, with large fat pigs weighing two or three hundred catties. Green bamboo grows into forests in the mountains and fields, and clear streams flow, making it truly beautiful with unique charm. Lujiang and Wuwei in the east are nationally famous rice-producing areas, which are the main source of the Wuhu rice market, and some of them are now controlled by the People's Liberation Army. Other products such as tea, paper, tung oil, and medicinal materials are the major products of the mountainous areas of western Anhui.

　　According to Comrade Gui Qi, one of the local leaders in western Anhui, their most urgent needs at present are to run schools and newspapers. He believes that newspapers will be a powerful tool for promoting the peasant emancipation movement and mobilizing the 6 million people of western Anhui. It is said that an open printing press and paper have already been prepared, and as long as there is a group of people to run the newspaper, the inaugural issue can soon meet the people of western Anhui.

　　我军控制望江芜湖间江岸线
  　获南下东征前进基地
    皖西百万农民卷入分田浪潮
  　群众积极参战有如老解放区
    【新华社鄂豫皖前线二十日电】记者王匡报导：人民解放军自九月以来，解放皖西大部地区，迄今皖西人民已建立了独山、六安、立煌、霍山、舒城、舒（城）六（安）、岳西、桐城、湖西（巢湖西）、桐（城）卢（江）、潜山、潜（山）怀（宁）太湖、宿松、望江、霍邱、英山等民主政府。解放军已控制自望江至芜湖数百里长的江岸线，与皖南人民武装隔江呼应。解放军在这里已获得了南下九江、东叩京芜的前进基地。皖西位于大别山的东南端，霍山、岳西等地，曾是苏维埃时期红军的根据地。抗日战争中，新四军在皖西坚持抗日；皖南事变后，又坚持了反对蒋匪“清剿”斗争。任凭蒋家匪帮如何摧残压迫，但皖西人民仍坚持斗争。当人民解放军大军到达后，群众情绪更为高涨。据曾在太行区做群众工作多年的于一川同志称：皖西群众的翻身斗争情绪很高，运动的声势和规模要比在太行区开始时大得多。当解放军在霍山西北歼灭六十旅时，岳西人民自动组织了三百付担架和数千民工到战场上去。霍山、桐城、六安的老百姓，积极设法掩护伤员，查岗放哨，几乎和华北老解放区的情形一样。土豪劣绅的浮财粮食分配以后，群众纷纷自动检举隐藏的蒋匪特务侦探，送交民主政府。蒋匪军于十月一日在皖西“清剿”抢粮，各地群众即将恶霸土劣先行逮捕带走，然后到处开展游击战，群众普遍提出：“先分粮食衣服钱，有吃有穿再分田”。现在已有近百万的人民开始卷入分田的浪潮中。不论大小村庄，成百成千的农民正在那里开会诉苦，及为庆贺自己的翻身而欢呼。分田运动象一团团烈火，在皖西各地燃烧起来了。
    皖西的农民，过去遭受着重重压迫，一是地主豪绅，二是县乡保甲，三是蒋桂匪军。如租佃关系，有好几个县是“二八分租”，地主占收成的百分之八十，佃农占收成的百分之二十；甚至还有“一九分租”的。此外佃农还需给“东家”出夫抬轿，过年过节送鸡鸭等额外剥削。抗战期间，蒋桂匪军盘踞皖西，县乡长都是广西人，他们普遍做的三件事是：先抓壮丁，后拉警察，霸占民房。老百姓把他们看得比日寇还坏。这次蒋桂匪军四十六师陷霍山时，城内外不及逃走的妇女全被奸污了。榆树店附近山上躲藏着八个少女，被匪军追得无处逃身，跳到水池里，匪军竟用枪杆将她们的头捺到水底，活活淹死。灾难重重的皖西穷苦人民，现在有一句口号是：“赤脚丁，穷光蛋，翻身运动带头干！”
    皖西大部地区都是山地，山脉纵横，群峦重叠，形势十分险要，和北方的山地大不相同。山间岔地甚多，如岳西境内县有宽达数十里的平原，盛产谷棉，有二三百斤的大肥猪，山野间绿竹成林，清流潺潺，真是山青水秀，别具风致。东面的卢江、无为是全国有名的产米区，亦即芜湖米市的主要来源地，现在有一部份为解放军所控制。其他如茶、纸、桐油、药材等，为皖西一带山地的大宗产品。
    据皖西地方负责人之一的桂栖同志称：目前他们最迫切需要的是办学校和办报纸。他认为报纸将是有力的推动农民翻身运动、发动皖西六百万人民的工具。据说一个对开的印刷机和纸张，都早已准备好了，只要有一批办报的人，创刊号很快的就可以和皖西的人民见面。
