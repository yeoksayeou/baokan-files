Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 17th: The Front Headquarters announced the battle achievements of the East China Eastern Front Corps in October as follows: A total of 20,723 Chiang bandit troops were annihilated, including the capture of Major General Zhang Zhongzhong (previously mistakenly reported as Zhang Zhongzhong), commander of the 211th Brigade of the Reorganized 45th Division; Lieutenant Colonel Lu Chengyu, acting chief of staff; Lieutenant Colonel Xiao Dingjing, director of the news office; and other officers and soldiers, totaling 10,523. The Chiang bandit army, in addition to suffering heavy casualties, had its entire establishment annihilated, including the 211th Brigade (missing one battalion) of the Reorganized 45th Division; the entire 468th Regiment and brigade supply battalion of the 156th Brigade of the Reorganized 64th Division; the entire 475th Regiment and two battalions of the 477th Regiment of the 159th Brigade; one battalion of the 393rd Regiment of the 131st Brigade; the 5th Regiment (missing one battalion) of the Independent Brigade of the Reorganized 8th Division; the supply battalion of the 42nd Brigade; the 170th Regiment (missing two companies) of the 55th Brigade of the 74th Division (rebuilt after being annihilated); and one battalion of the 17th Engineer Regiment. Our army seized 38 artillery pieces of various types, 725 machine guns of various types, 5,078 rifles and other ammunition and supplies, and shot down three Chiang aircraft.

Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 17th: "Difficult to defend, even more difficult to escape, precarious situation, deeply worried!" This is a sketch of the current embarrassing situation of the Jiaodong Chiang bandits by our front-line reporter in commenting on the battle achievements of the East China Eastern Front Liberation Army in October. The reporter listed the following facts to illustrate the characteristics of this situation:

First, the serious weakening of the Chiang bandit's military strength. In October, the East China Eastern Front Liberation Army annihilated more than 20,000 Chiang bandit troops. If calculated by the regular army whose establishment was annihilated, it totals one reorganized brigade (three regiments plus one brigade headquarters), four complete regiments (three battalions plus one regimental headquarters making up one complete regiment), and four complete battalions. If we add the more than 13,000 enemies annihilated by our army during the internal blocking period before October, and the total number of enemies annihilated by the broad local corps and militias, then the heavy losses suffered by the bandit army are quite considerable. Take the bandit Reorganized 64th Division as an example: the division suffered extremely heavy casualties after two Zhucheng battles (the Zhucheng counterattack on September 12 and the Zhucheng liberation battle on October 15) and one Jiaohe battle. According to its deserters, the division now has less than 6,000 people from the division commander Huang Guoliang down to cooks, horsemen, and soldiers, including a division headquarters, three brigade headquarters, and several regimental branches and other large non-combat units. Another example is the Reorganized 9th Division, which is known as the main force of the Jiaodong Chiang bandits. According to captured soldiers, it was also killed and wounded more than 3,000 in the Jiaohe battle, including several important military officer units. Other bandit troops, such as the Reorganized 8th Division, the Reorganized 54th Division, and the Reorganized 25th Division, have also been repeatedly attacked, and their military strength has been greatly weakened.

Second, the serious dispersion of the Chiang bandit's military strength. The direct result of the enemy's dispersed and weakened military strength is the convenience for the Liberation Army to gradually recover lost ground and shrink the Chiang-occupied area. Since the end of September and up to the beginning of November, the Liberation Army has successively recovered eight cities on the Jiaodong battlefield: Yexian, Changyi, Weihaiwei, Muping, Zhucheng, Qixia, Zhaoyuan, and Pingdu. Some were due to the Chiang bandits not having enough troops and not daring to defend to the death, abandoning the city and fleeing, such as Changyi, Muping, Zhaoyuan, and Qixia; some were Chiang bandits who had already fled and attempted to make a comeback, but were repeatedly hit hard and ultimately failed, such as Weihaiwei; some were those who vainly attempted to defend to the death and were annihilated, such as the defending enemy in Yexian; and some were those who dared not defend to the death but could not escape, and were eventually wiped out in one fell swoop, such as Zhucheng. As of now, only eight towns are temporarily in the hands of the Chiang bandits: Yantai, Longkou, Huangxian, Penglai, Fushan, Laiyang, Jiaoxian, and Gaomi. Compared with the situation before October when the Chiang bandits advanced on Jiaodong from all directions and launched a large-scale northern invasion, successively occupying 14 cities, it is really going downhill.

The reporter went on to point out that the decisive factor in causing this fundamental change was the great victory of the Jiaohe River from October 3rd to 9th. In this battle, the East China Eastern Front Liberation Army completely defeated eight brigades of Chiang bandits in six days and nights of fierce fighting, annihilating more than 12,000 bandits. From then on, the Liberation Army gained the initiative in the war and launched a series of internal counter-offensives. After recovering Weihaiwei on October 9, it repeatedly broke the Chiang bandits' multiple offensives. On October 3, the battle of Qugezhuang, southeast of Laiyang, annihilated more than 700 enemies; on the 15th, the battle of Dongxiagezhuang (southwest of Laixi) annihilated 2,300 enemies; on the same day, Zhucheng was captured, annihilating 2,400 enemies, making the Chiang bandits passive everywhere and utterly embarrassed. Although the Chiang bandits have also carried out several defensive and predatory "sweeps" for the sake of their defense, they no longer have the strength to organize a decent offensive. Moreover, even such defensive and predatory "sweeps" have been strongly attacked by the powerful local corps and people's armed forces in the liberated areas.

The reporter continued to point out: This critical situation has made the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, who were still touting Jiaodong's "victory" not long ago, feel panicked and confused. On October 16 – the day after the spokesperson of the Liberation Army Headquarters pointed out that our army in Jiaodong had entered a counter-offensive and the day our army captured Zhucheng – the bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek flew to Qingdao in a panic. Coincidentally, around the time of Chiang's flight to Qingdao, many bandit official newspapers in Qingdao wailed and sighed: "People are uneasy, rumors are rampant, and everyone is a soldier." "The atmosphere of alarm has enveloped the entire city of Qingdao." "The public security situation is also precarious." (Qingdao Public Report) In other smaller cities, the Chiang bandits were even more panicked all day long. The bandit army in Anqiu City simply closed the four gates day and night. Even the bandit leader Wang Yaowu, who was far away in Jinan, hurriedly transferred the 73rd Division, which had been completely annihilated and then pieced together again, back to Jinan to prevent "unexpected events."

The reporter concluded: Now October has passed. October is an ominous month for the Jiaodong Chiang bandits; for all the commanders and fighters of the East China Eastern Front Liberation Army and the people of Shandong, it is a month full of victories, a month in which the Shandong battlefield continues to launch a larger offensive. The spokesperson of the Liberation Army Headquarters predicted: "On this battlefield, the Liberation Army will annihilate more enemies in the future than in the past." All the commanders and fighters of the East China Eastern Front Liberation Army will surely respond to this brilliant prediction with more glorious victories, and it can be asserted that no matter how painstakingly Chiang Kai-shek tries to save the dying, the Jiaodong Chiang bandits, who have taken the risk of getting deeply trapped in the quagmire, will not escape the fate of complete collapse, just like the Hu bandits in northern Shaanxi.

　　屡遭歼灭打击兵力削弱分散
  　胶东蒋匪深陷泥淖
    既难死守又难逃走窘相毕露
    【新华社华东前线十七日电】前线指挥部公布华东东线兵团十月份战绩如下：共歼蒋匪二万零七百二十三名，内生俘整四十五师二一一旅少将旅长张忠中（前误为张中忠）、中校代参谋长陆承裕、中校新闻室主任萧定京等以下官兵一万零五百二十三名，毙伤整四五师二一一旅少将副旅长金孟熔（伤）该旅二团上校团长李正煦（毙）等以下一万零二百名。蒋匪军除遭重大杀伤者外，其整个建制被歼者，计有整四五师之二一一旅（缺一个营），整六四师一五六旅四六八团全部及旅部辎重营，一五九旅四七五团全部及四七七团两个营，一三一旅之三九三团一个营，整八师独立旅之第五团（缺一个营），四十二旅之辎重营，七十四师（被歼后重建者）五十五旅之一七○团（缺两个连）及工兵十七团之一个营。我军缴获各种炮三十八门、各种机枪七二五挺、长短枪五○七八支及其他弹药物资甚多，并击落蒋机三架。
    【新华社华东前线十七日电】“既难死守，又难逃走，处境险恶，好不忧愁！”这是本社前线记者在评论华东东线解放军十月份战绩时，对目前胶东蒋匪狼狈窘态的一个素描。记者列举如下事实说明这一形势的特点：
    第一、蒋匪兵力的严重削弱。十月份中，华东东线解放军歼蒋匪二万以上，如以建制被歼的正规军计算，共折合一个整旅（三个团加一个旅部）、四个整团（以三个营加一个团部合一个整团）和四个整营。如果加上十月份以前我军内线阻击时期歼敌一万三千余名和广大地方兵团民兵歼敌总数，则匪军损失之重，当大有可观。以匪整六十四师为例：该师经过两次诸城战役（九月十二日诸城反击战及十月十五日诸城解放战）和一次胶河战役，伤亡极大。据其逃兵称：现该师上自师长黄国梁下至伙、马、兵夫，已不足六千人，其中还包括一个师部、三个旅部及若干团支部等庞大的非战斗单位在内。又如号称胶东蒋匪主力的整九师，据俘兵称：在胶河战役中，亦被杀伤三千以上，其中并包括若干重要军官单位在内。其他匪军，如整八师、整五四师、整二十五师等部亦屡受打击，兵力已大为削弱。
    第二、蒋匪兵力的严重分散。敌兵力分散与削弱的直接结果，便造成了解放军逐渐收复失地缩小蒋占区的便利条件。自九月下旬起，迄十一月上旬，解放军在胶东战场上已先后收复了掖县、昌邑、威海卫、牟平、诸城、栖霞、招远、平度八座城市。其中有的是由于蒋匪兵力不足，不敢死守，弃城而逃者，如昌邑、牟平、招远、栖霞；有的是蒋匪原已逃走企图卷土重来，但屡遭痛击终未获逞者，如威海卫；有的是妄图死守而被歼者，如掖县守敌；有的既不敢死守但又无法逃走，终被一鼓歼灭者，如诸城便是。截至目前，暂时还在蒋匪手中的，仅有烟台、龙口、黄县、蓬莱、福山、莱阳、胶县和高密八座城镇。比起十月份以前蒋匪向胶东各路齐头并进、大举北犯，先后侵占了十四座城市时的形势，真是江河日下了。
    记者继指出造成这个根本变化的决定因素，是十月三日至九日的胶河大捷。在这一战役中，华东东线解放军以六昼夜的激战，完全击败蒋匪八个旅，歼匪一万二千余。从此，解放军就取得了战争主动权，并连续展开了一连串的内线反攻出击，十月九日收复威海卫后，又接连打破蒋匪的多次进犯。十月三日，莱阳东南曲格庄之战歼敌七百余；十五日，东夏格庄（莱西南）之战，歼敌二千三百；同日攻克诸城，歼敌二千四百，打得蒋匪处处被动，狼狈不堪。虽然蒋匪为了其防御的安全，也进行了若干次防御性与掠夺性的“扫荡”，但已无力量再组织一个象样的进攻。而且即是这种防御性和掠夺性的“扫荡”，也遭到解放区强大地方兵团和人民武装的坚强打击。
    记者继指出：这种危急的形势，已经使得不久以前还在大吹胶东“胜利”的蒋家匪帮感到惊惶忙乱了。十月十六日——即解放军总部发言人指出胶东我军进入反攻与我军攻克诸城之次日——，匪首蒋介石仓惶飞至青岛；恰恰就在蒋贼飞青的前后，青岛的许多匪帮官方报纸哀声叹气地惊呼：“人心不安，风声鹤唳，草木皆兵。”“惊扰之气，更笼罩整个青市上空”。“治安情形，亦岌岌可危。”（青岛公报）其他较小城市，蒋匪更是惶惶不可终日，安邱城匪军干脆日夜紧闭四门，甚至远在济南的匪首王耀武，也急急忙忙把那个已被全歼后又重新拼凑起来的七十三师调回济南，以防“不测”。
    记者最后称：现在十月份已经过去了，十月份对于胶东蒋匪来说，是不祥的月份；对于华东东线解放军全体指战员和山东人民来说，却是充满胜利的月份，是山东战场继续着更大攻势的月份。解放军总部发言人预言：“在这个战场上，解放军将在今后较之过去更大量的歼灭敌人。”华东东线解放军全体指战员一定会以更光辉的胜利，来回答这个英明的预言，而且可以断言：不管蒋贼如何煞费心机，妄图救死，但既经冒险深陷泥淖的胶东蒋匪，将和陕北胡匪一样，逃不了完全崩溃的命运。
