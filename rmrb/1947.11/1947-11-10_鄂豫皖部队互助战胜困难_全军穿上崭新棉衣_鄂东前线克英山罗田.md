Xinhua News Agency, E Yu Wan Front, 8th: The People's Liberation Army has now put on brand-new cotton-padded clothing sewn by everyone's own hands. In this sewing of clothes and making of shoes, the troops launched a new mutual assistance and solidarity movement. After the counter-offensive army arrived in the Dabie Mountains, because winter clothing was imminent and it was not easy to gather a large number of ready-made garment workers, the troops mobilized soldiers who knew how to sew to sew cotton-padded clothing for soldiers who did not know how to sew; southern soldiers taught northern soldiers how to make straw sandals; northern soldiers taught southern soldiers how to mend old shoes; and other soldiers who did not know how to sew and make shoes took on more public errands. The troops also encouraged and called on everyone to learn sewing. In the end, the difficulty that the entire army might have to go barefoot and freeze was completely resolved through mutual assistance and solidarity.

Xinhua News Agency, E Yu Wan Front, 8th: Peasants in western Anhui who have turned over are actively helping the People's Liberation Army solve the difficulty of getting shoes. In the Yuexi area alone, the people have automatically made 60,000 pairs of shoes for the People's Liberation Army. When the people of Qianshan County were forced to make military shoes for the Chiang bandit army in the past, they used bamboo shoot sheaths as soles and coarse hemp thread to sew the soles. The shoe uppers were made of coarse cloth and lined with fire paper. The common people called them "rotten feet." Now, when making military shoes for the People's Liberation Army, they use coarse cloth as soles, use thick hemp thread to sew the soles, and the shoe uppers are lined with old foreign cloth. They are sewn inside out and even have shoelaces. The common people call them "thousand-year change," and the people's enthusiastic love for the People's Liberation Army can be seen from this. When the soldiers put on these sturdy and durable new shoes, they said very happily: "We have a home now. Let's work hard to win battles, perform meritorious service for the people of E Yu Wan, and build the Dabie Mountains into the Taihang Mountains."

Xinhua News Agency, E Yu Wan Front, 8th: The People's Liberation Army recovered Yingshan City for the third time on the 4th. The Chiang bandit and puppet security team entrenched in the city fled to the Huangbai Mountain area more than ten miles southeast of Yingshan. Another People's Liberation Army unit recovered Luotian County for the fifth time on the 29th of last month. The defending enemy, the 516th Regiment of the Seventh Division, fled westward. Luotian has changed hands several times, and the people have realized that the People's Liberation Army and the patriotic democratic government are truly the saviors of the people. After our army and government entered the city, the common people came one after another to complain and accuse the Chiang bandit army of its crimes.

    鄂豫皖部队互助战胜困难
    全军穿上崭新棉衣
    鄂东前线克英山罗田
    【新华社鄂豫皖前线八日电】解放军现已换上大家亲手缝制的崭新棉衣。在此次缝衣做鞋中，部队开展了新的互助团结。反攻大军到达大别山后，因冬衣在即，不易集中大批成衣工人，即动员部队中会缝衣的战士给不会缝衣的战士们缝棉衣，南方战士教北方的战士们打草鞋；北方战士教南方战士补旧鞋；而其他不会缝衣做鞋的战士们，就变工多担任公差。各部队并鼓励与号召大家人人学习缝制。终使全军可能赤脚受冻的困难在互助团结中完全解决。
    【新华社鄂豫皖前线八日电】皖西翻身农民积极为解放军解决穿鞋困难。仅岳西一带人民，已自动为解放军做鞋六万双。潜山县的人民，过去被迫给蒋匪军做军鞋时，用笋箨垫底，以粗麻线纳底子，鞋面用粗布，以火纸衬托，老百姓叫做“两脚烂”。现在给解放军做军鞋，用粗布垫底，用大麻线纳底子，鞋面用老洋布衬托子，反着上底，还缝有鞋带。老百姓叫做“千年换”，人民对解放军之爱戴的热情，于此可见。战士们穿上这种坚实耐久的新鞋时，非常高兴的说：“我们有了家了，赶快努力打胜仗，为鄂豫皖人民立功，把大别山建设成太行山。”
    【新华社鄂豫皖前线八日电】解放军四日第三次收复英山城。盘踞该城之蒋匪伪保安队，逃窜英山东南十余里之黄柏山地区。另部解放军上月二十九日第五次收复罗田县城。守敌第七师之五一六团向西逃窜，罗田经历次易手，人民已认清了解放军和爱国民主政府真正是人民的救星，当我军队及政府入城后，老百姓即纷纷前来诉苦，控诉蒋匪军之罪行。
