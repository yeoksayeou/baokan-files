Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. Facts continue to emerge showing that people in the Chiang-controlled areas deeply despise the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's sham election. According to a United Press reporter on the 24th, on the busiest street in Nanjing, fifty people were randomly asked for their opinions on the "voting issue." The average answers obtained were as follows: Among the laboring class—rickshaw pullers, street sweepers, handicraftsmen, etc.—only one out of ten "participated in the voting"; among merchants and shopkeepers, approximately two out of ten "participated in the voting"; among the liberal professions—teachers, journalists, lawyers, etc.—only three out of ten "participated in the voting." The United Press reporter also reported that passersby gave the following reasons for not participating in the voting: the majority of laborers either said they had never heard of "elections," or had heard of them but did not understand the meaning and purpose of such so-called "elections"; the majority of merchants said without interest that they were "too busy"; and those in the liberal professions expressed contempt for the election, saying that "the election results were already determined."

　　蒋区人民蔑视伪选
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】蒋管区人民对蒋匪伪选极表轻视的事实续被透露。据合众社记者二十四日于南京最热闹之马路，以“投票问题”随意征询五十个人意见，获得平均数答案如下：苦力阶级——洋车夫，清道夫，手工业者等十人中仅有一人“参加投票”；商人，店主等十人中约有二人“参加投票”；自由职业阶级——教师、记者、律师等，十人中亦仅有三人“参加投票”。该社记者并报导过路者答复不参加投票之原因称：大多数的苦力或则说他们从没有听说过“选举”，或则听说过，但弄不清楚这种所谓“选举”的意义和目的；大多数商人都毫无兴趣地说他们“太忙碌”；自由职业者则对选举表示轻蔑，并说“选举结果早就定好了。”
