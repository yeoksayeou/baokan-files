    Xu Guzhai Mutual Aid Great Exchange Labor
    Poor Peasants Universally Plant More Wheat
    [Report from this newspaper's Jinan office on the 3rd] Xu Guzhai in the second district of Wei County solved the difficulties faced by poor peasants in planting wheat and expanded wheat fields by 19 *qing*. By adjusting wheat seeds and implementing a large-scale labor exchange, when the wheat planting began, poor peasants were very discouraged due to numerous difficulties. For example, the poor peasant Shi Wenxian said, "I won't be able to plant wheat this year. I don't even have a single wheat seed. What should I do?" The poor peasant widow Zhang Sunshi said, "Not to mention wheat seeds, I don't even have livestock or furniture for planting wheat. And there's no one at home, it's really difficult. I won't be able to plant wheat this year." After discovering this situation, the village cadres immediately convened a joint meeting of the 17 mutual aid team leaders in the village to specifically discuss solving the difficulties faced by poor peasants in planting wheat. At the meeting, everyone spoke enthusiastically, proposing to help poor peasants and widowed households plant wheat. Those without wheat seeds could borrow or exchange them, bad wheat seeds could be adjusted, and those without farm tools or manpower could mutually exchange labor. Everyone expressed that this would solve the difficulties faced by poor peasants. The mutual aid team leader Shi Qinglin said, "This year our team guarantees to plant 50 *mu* more." Afterwards, a mass meeting of non-mutual aid team members was held to mobilize and solve the difficulties faced by poor peasants in planting wheat. For poor, widowed, and orphaned individuals, it was explained that to plant wheat, it was best to participate in mutual aid. Participating in mutual aid would not be difficult, and they could exchange labor by working for others. After such repeated mobilization, the poor peasants understood the idea and became very enthusiastic. For example, the poor widow Zhang Wangshi said, "As long as someone cares, exchanging labor is a good way." The entire village has a total of 348 households, with 132 large and small livestock. Except for 10 households that were struggled against, all the rest were organized in a unified manner. All human and animal power was mobilized to implement a large-scale mutual aid wheat planting labor exchange. For example, the poor peasant Shi Wenxian, who did not have wheat seeds, exchanged sorghum with Shi Ruqin, using 1.5 *jin* of sorghum to exchange for 1 *jin* of wheat seeds. The poor widow Shi Liushi borrowed 20 *jin* of wheat seeds from Shi Ruming. The family member of a soldier representative, Yang Lao Ju, voluntarily took out 250 *jin* of wheat seeds to lend to poor peasants and military dependents. Poor, widowed, and orphaned peasants without farm tools or manpower joined the mutual aid. Children cut grass and dug up stubble, women picked cotton, and there were no idle people. With all-out efforts, all the wheat fields were planted in seven days, totaling 25 *qing* and 12.5 *mu*, 19 *qing* more than last year. Because the difficulties faced by poor peasants in planting wheat were solved in a timely manner, the wheat planting area was greatly expanded. At the same time, the wheat of the families of stretcher bearers was also planted. The entire village has a population of 1,041 people, with each person planting an average of 3 *mu* of wheat, exceeding the original plan by 0.5 *mu* per person, accounting for one-third of all the land in the village. The amount of wheat planted in the village ranks first in the second district of Wei County. The moved poor widow Shi Sunshi said, "Everyone is really concerned about me. If it weren't for the mutual aid team, I wouldn't have been able to plant wheat this year."

    徐固寨互助大换工
    贫农普遍多种麦
    【本报冀南三日电】威县二区徐固寨解决贫农种麦困难，扩大麦田十九顷。调剂麦种，实行大换工，开始种麦时，贫农因为种麦困难很多，情绪极为低落。如贫农石文显说：“咱今年种不上麦子了，连一粒麦种也没有，怎样办呢？”贫农寡妇张孙氏说：“别说麦种，就连种麦的牲口、家具啥也没有。家里又没人，真难呀。今年麦子种不上了。”村干发现这种情况后，就马上召开全村十七个互助组长联席会，专门讨论解决贫农种麦困难。会上均热烈发言，提出要帮助贫农及孤寡户把麦子种上，没麦种的可互相借，互相换，坏麦种可以调剂，没农具和没人力的可互相变工、换工；都表示这样就能解决贫农困难。互助组长石庆林说：“今年俺组保证多种五十亩。”事后又召开非互助组的群众性会，进行动员，解决贫农种麦困难。对贫农孤寡要说明想种上麦子，最好参加互助，参加互助不作难，可给人家作活来互相换工。经过这样反复的动员，贫农打通思想，情绪极高，如贫农孤寡张王氏说：“只要有人管就行，换工才是个好办法哩。”全村共三百四十八户，共有大小牲口一百三十二头，除十户被斗户外，其余全部统一组织起来，所有人畜力总动员，实行互助种麦大换工。如贫农石文显没麦种，向石汝琴用高粱换，一斤半高粱换一斤麦种。贫农孤寡石刘氏借了石汝明二十斤麦种。抗属代表杨老聚自动拿出二百五十斤麦种借给贫苦农民及军属。没农具和没人力的贫农孤寡参加了互助，小孩割草刨茬子，妇女拾花，无闲人，全力突击，七天将所有麦田全部种上，共种麦廿五顷十二亩半，比去年多种十九顷。由于及时解决了贫农种麦困难，就大量扩大了种麦面积，同时把出担架家属的麦子也都种上，全村人口共一千零四十一人，每人平均种了三亩麦子，每人超过原订计划半亩，占全村所有地之三分之一，该村种麦数量占威县二区第一名。感动的贫农孤寡石孙氏说：“大家对我真关心。要不是互助组今年麦子可种不了。”
