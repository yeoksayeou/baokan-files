Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. A Central News Agency broadcast on the 20th stated that the Chiang Kai-shek's Central Daily News editorial admitted that the current smuggling in the Chiang-controlled areas is even more rampant than the large-scale smuggling of Japanese goods before the War of Resistance. It also cited figures released by the Chiang bandit Ministry of Finance, stating that from January 1st to October 20th of this year, the customs offices alone seized more than 17,800 smuggling cases, with the value of smuggled goods totaling 145.1 billion yuan. Among them, the Yuehai and Kowloon customs in South China, and the Jianghai customs in Shanghai, cracked more than two or three thousand cases each. The Jianghai customs seized the most smuggled goods. Regarding the main reasons for the rampant smuggling, the editorial claimed that in addition to the Chiang government's unreasonable import and export trade controls and foreign exchange controls, the use of power and armed smuggling by Chiang government's bureaucrats and military personnel was also one of the main reasons. According to a report in the Shanghai Dagongbao on the 24th of last month, citing statistics released by the Chiang bandit Ministry of Finance on smuggling, the smuggled imports are mainly consumer industrial products such as cigarettes, cosmetics, flour, milk powder, canned food, saccharin, wool fabrics, rayon, cigarette paper, kerosene, and Western medicine, the vast majority of which are American goods, followed by Japanese goods. The smuggled exports are mainly industrial raw materials such as salt, soybeans, tin ingots, silver, tungsten ore, tung oil, and rice.

　　蒋党官僚武装保护下
    美货日货走私猖獗
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】中央社二十日广播：蒋党中央日报社论供认目前蒋管区之走私，较抗战前之日货大走私尤为猖獗。并引蒋匪财政部发表之数字，自今年一月一日至十月二十日仅被各海关缉获之走私案件，即达一万七千八百余件，私货价值共达一千四百五十一亿元。其中在华南之粤海、九龙两关，及上海之江海关所破获者均在二三千件以上。缉获之私货则以江海关占首位。关于走私猖獗之主要原因，该社论供称，除由于蒋政府不合理之进出口贸易管制及外汇管制办法外，蒋政府之官僚军人利用权势武装走私，亦为主因之一。另据上月二十四日上海大公报引蒋匪财政部关于走私所发表之统计称：走私之进口货以卷烟、化妆品、面粉、奶粉、罐头食品、糖精、毛织品、人造丝、卷烟纸、火油、西药等消费用的工业制成品为大宗，绝大多数为美货，次为日货。而走私出口货则以食盐、大豆、锡块、银、钨砂、桐油、米等工业原料为大宗。
