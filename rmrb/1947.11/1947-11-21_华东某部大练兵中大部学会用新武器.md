Xinhua News Agency, East China, 19th: In a recent three-month intensive training exercise, a unit of the East China People's Liberation Army has largely mastered the use of new weapons and cultivated a large number of technical personnel. Since its establishment, the unit has achieved remarkable results in learning and mastering new weapons seized from the Chiang bandits, such as howitzers, tanks, and flamethrowers. All comrades in a certain detachment are now proficient in the use and operation of howitzers. Zhang Rentai, a barely literate communication soldier from a certain company, can single-handedly operate all the actions of eight gunners, and remembers the function and weight of each part by heart. To facilitate learning, soldiers created wooden artillery sights, steering wheels, firing grips, and other shooting devices. Shui Yangpu, who had been an artilleryman for 22 years after being liberated from the Battle of Lunan, now has to learn from his newly trained comrades. The special forces school run by the unit has reformed a large number of liberated technical personnel and newly trained a large number of technical personnel in observation, gunnery, tanks, and telecommunications. Many newly trained comrades have surpassed liberated technical personnel in driving cars and tanks, as well as in repair techniques. At the same time, they have solved the problem of the difficulty of electromagnetic machines firing, which was never solved by the liberated technical personnel. The loading and unloading time of tank-mounted machine guns has been reduced from five minutes to one minute and twenty-five seconds. Comrade Li Guiren can complete the loading and unloading in just three minutes and thirty-seven seconds while blindfolded. Comrades in the observation team learned the necessary knowledge of trigonometry and geometry for aiming in four weeks. A certain cavalry detachment has mastered more than 40 kinds of horsemanship. Although the young artillerymen dare not say they are 100% accurate, they were able to hit more than 90% of their targets in the Tai'an and Linqu campaigns.

　　华东某部大练兵中大部学会用新武器
    【新华社华东十九日电】华东人民解放军某部于最近短短三个月练兵运动中，大部熟练了新式武器的使用，并培养出大批技术人材。该部自成立后，对缴自蒋匪的榴弹炮、战车、火焰喷射器等新式武器的学习与掌握，现已获惊人成绩，某支队全体同志已熟习榴弹炮使用与操作。一字不识的某连通讯员张仁太，一人能操作八个炮手的各种动作，对每一零件的作用重量，记得烂熟。为了方便学习，战士创造了木制炮镜方向盘、拉火握把等射击器具。从鲁南战役解放过来的当过二十二年炮兵的税阳普，现在都得跟新学的同志学习。该部所办之特科学校改造了大批被解放的技术人员和新训练出大批观测、炮手、战车、电讯等技术人材。许多新学的同志在驾驶汽车、战车，并在修理技术上超过了被解放的技术人员。同时解决了为被解放的技术人员所从未解决的电磁机对火的困难，战车上机炮的装卸时间从五分钟减到一分二十五秒。李贵仁同志蒙着眼睛只要三分三十七秒即装卸完毕，观察队的同志，在四周内学会瞄准用的三角、几何的必要知识。某某骑兵支队已熟练四十多种马术，青年炮兵虽不敢说百发百中，但在泰安、临朐战役中，能命中百分之九十以上。
