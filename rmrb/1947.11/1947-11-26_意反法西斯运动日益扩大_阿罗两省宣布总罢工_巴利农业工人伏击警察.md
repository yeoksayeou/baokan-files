Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th: Reports from various sources: The Italian people's heroic anti-fascist self-defense has forced fully armed police into a state of "fragile defense" (Associated Press, 20th). The left-wing leader of the Socialist Party, Nenni, declared at a press conference on the 22nd that he might call for a general strike throughout Italy to protest the atrocities against Italian workers. The Italian General Confederation of Labor (note: with seven million members and civil servants) has announced its solidarity with the 200,000 agricultural workers in Puglia province who are on a planting strike. The Apulia province in southern Italy and the Rovigo province in northern Italy have declared a general strike. Electrical workers in Rome and Milan have also gone on strike. Elementary school teachers in Milan have decided to stop teaching. Strikers in Rovigo province, armed with clubs, entered nearby towns to persuade all businesses to close. Business in Bari (capital of Apulia province) has come to a standstill, with food stores only opening at specified times. The police's attempts to suppress the masses with bloody means have repeatedly failed. On the 21st, agricultural workers in Bari ambushed two trucks of police, killing more than 20 officers and policemen. Strikers in Apulia blockaded all roads leading to the towns, and many cities in the province have been isolated by the strikers. In Caltanissetta, Sicily, one thousand miners and agricultural workers surrounded the police station, attempting to execute the director and severely beat the police. The leader of the Italian Communist Party, Togliatti, compared Gasperi to Mussolini in "Unità" and condemned him for dragging Italy back to reaction.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th: Moscow News: Markov commented on the Italian anti-fascist movement in "Pravda", stating that the people's movement sweeping through Italy from the Po River basin to Sicily like a storm demonstrates the growing strength of young Italian democracy. Anger at fascist thugs shows that no one in Italy can remain indifferent to such provocative schemes. Markov emphasized that if the Italian democratic forces unite around the Communist Party, which has more than two million members, and if the Italian working class resolutely counterattacks the fascist provocateurs, the Italian reactionary forces will have to retreat. Markov went on to criticize the Italian reactionary government for colluding with U.S. imperialism to enslave Italy, and forcefully stated: "Italian democrats and working people will never let themselves be used as bargaining chips in American gambling. Unlike other countries in Western Europe, Italy, despite the conspiracies of the U.S. and British lackeys bought in the Italian workers' movement and the fierce resistance of the traitor Saragat and the right wing of the Socialist Party, finally achieved united action between the Communist Party and the Socialist Party to confront the reactionaries with a united front of the working class. At present, the freedom-loving people of Italy are using mass demonstrations to oppose the reactionary policy of selling out Italian national sovereignty and protest against those who dream of reviving fascism with American loans. The Communist Party and the Socialist Party have become the center of uniting all democratic and patriotic forces of these peace-loving Italian people.

　　意反法西斯运动日益扩大
  　阿罗两省宣布总罢工
    巴利农业工人伏击警察
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】各方讯：意大利人民反法西斯的英勇自卫，迫使全副武装的警察处于“脆弱的防御”中（美联社二十日电）。社会党左翼领袖南尼二十二日在记者招待会上宣称：可能号召全意总罢工，以抗议反对意大利工人的暴行。意总工会（按：拥有七百万会员及公务员）顷宣布与蒲格里亚省罢耕之二十万农业工人团结一致。意南阿蒲里亚省及北意罗维哥省已宣布总罢工。罗马及米兰的电气工人亦相继罢工。米兰的小学教师已决定罢教。以棍棒武装起来的罗维哥省的罢工者，进入附近城镇，说服一切工商业关门。巴利（阿蒲里亚省首府）的工商业已陷于停顿状态，粮食店仅在规定的时间开门。警察想用血腥手段镇压群众的企图已一再地失败了。巴利农业工人二十一日曾伏击两卡车警察，击毙军官、警士二十余人。阿蒲里亚罢工者对封锁通往城镇的一切道路，该省很多城市已为罢工者所孤立。西西里的卡尔塔尼塞塔有一千矿工及农业工人包围警察局企图将局长处死，并痛打了警察。意共领袖托格里亚蒂在团结报中把加斯具利比作莫索里尼，并谴责他正在把意大利拖回到反动去。
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】莫斯科讯：马可夫在真理报上评意大利反法西斯运动称：像暴风雨般横扫意大利波河流域至西西里的人民运动，表现了意大利年青的民主主义日益成长的力量。对法西斯恶棍的愤怒，表示目前意大利没有一个人能对那样挑衅的计谋漠然忍受。马可夫强调指出：假如意大利民主力量团结在有两百万以上党员的共产党周围，假如意工人阶级给法西斯挑衅者以坚决的反击，意反动势力就会非退却不可。马可夫继抨击意反动政府勾结美帝国主义奴役意国的计划，力称：“意民主分子及劳动人民决不会让他们自己作为美国在赌博中的筹码。意大利与西欧其他国家不同，纵然有美英在意大利工人运动中所收买的走狗的阴谋及叛徒萨拉盖特社会党右翼的猛烈反抗，而终于达成了共产党与社会党的一致行动，以工人阶级的联合阵线对付反动派。目前，爱好自由的意大利人民，他们正用群众示威来反对反动派出卖意国家主权的政策，抗议梦想以美国贷款来复活法西斯主义的人们。共产党与社会党已成为团结这些爱好和平的意大利人民的一切民主与爱国势力的中心。
