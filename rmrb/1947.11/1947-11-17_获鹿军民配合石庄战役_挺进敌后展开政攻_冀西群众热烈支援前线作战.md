　　[Our Newspaper, Taihang, 15th] The Huolu County Party, government, and civil organizations, along with militia forces, cooperated with the Jin-Cha-Ji (Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei) Field Army in the siege of Shijiazhuang. Starting in late October, they combined with sub-district troops to advance behind enemy lines, launching large-scale political offensives, conducting mine warfare, and helping the masses distribute the autumn harvest and land, greatly expanding the situation behind enemy lines. Before the political offensive teams departed, they carried the People's Liberation Army's Double Tenth Festival declaration, slogans, safe passage permits welcoming the surrender of Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops, and joint proclamations from the sub-districts and special corps, distributing large quantities of propaganda materials behind enemy lines. Huolu County's first, second, and third district militias arrested a large number of fleeing landlords during the political offensive, backing up the masses and making decisions for them, distributing the autumn harvest and land. The Second District wrote many persuasion letters to the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops stationed at various strongholds, greatly shaking their morale. Taking advantage of this, we convened a conference of village chiefs from behind enemy lines, with all but one village, Village X, participating. Huang Jiuqiu, the head of the "Joint Village Association" entrusted by the enemy, convened two meetings of village chiefs in an attempt to organize the "Joint Village Association," but the village chiefs were afraid to attend. Local masses also competed to hand over "anti-aggression grain." They said, "This is truly the era of us poor people; we must hand over more 'anti-aggression grain'!" The Third District alone delivered over 200,000 jin. When a certain village near the railway delivered grain, they feared the sound of the carts would alert the enemy, so they wrapped the wheels with hemp rope. When Village X in the Third District delivered grain, they brought hand grenades, ready to fight if they encountered the enemy. When they returned, they voluntarily asked for propaganda materials to distribute to the masses in their village. After the 7th Division of the 3rd Army of Shijiazhuang was annihilated at Qingfengdian, the enemy frantically conscripted soldiers in the periphery of Shijiazhuang, requiring twenty from each bao (group of 100 households). However, under the power of our political offensive, many young men fled to our district. The Huolu County government set up youth reception stations in villages along the border to specifically accommodate the fleeing youth.
　　
    [Our Newspaper, Taihang, 15th] In Gaoyi, Jingxing, Zanhuang, Shahe, Neiqiu, and other counties, the liberated peasants, under the slogan of liberating Shijiazhuang and attacking Yuanshi, launched an enthusiastic campaign to join the army and participate in the war. Upon hearing that our troops were besieging Yuanshi city, women in Gaoyi villages ground flour for the troops all night. Xu Jia Zhuang ground 2,800 jin overnight, making it very fine and white. Mofang Village, with fewer than thirty households, received a notice from the district to grind flour for the anti-aggression army. Men and women throughout the village competed to go to the district to collect wheat, and the women ground it all night, grinding 800 jin of wheat in one night. The youth of East and West Hanzhuang, upon hearing the news of attacking Yuanshi and Shijiazhuang, quickly packed their bags and prepared stretchers, waiting for orders to depart. Nanqiu Village held a meeting to participate in the war overnight. Wang Defu ran home before the meeting ended to have his wife prepare shoes and socks. Throughout the village, under the flickering lights, they chopped firewood and steamed dry rations, preparing to depart.

    【本报太行十五日电】我获鹿县党政民各机关及民兵武装，配合晋察冀我军围攻石庄战役，于上月下旬开始结合分区部队挺进敌后，展开大规模的政治攻势，并进行地雷爆炸，帮助群众分秋分田，大大开展了敌后局面。政攻组出发前，携带人民解放军双十节宣言、口号与欢迎蒋伪军投诚的平安通行证、分区及专团联合布告等大批宣传品，向敌后散发。获鹿一、二、三区民兵在政攻中逮捕了大批逃亡地主，给群众撑腰作主，分秋分田。二区曾给各据点蒋伪军写了不少争取信，其军心大大动摇，我即趁机召开敌后保长会议，除×村一个村外，全部参加了。受敌委托之“联庄会”长黄九秋曾召开两次保长会议，企图组织“联庄会”，各村保长却不敢前往参加。当地群众并争缴反攻粮。他们说：“这可是咱们穷人的天下了，可要多缴反攻粮啦！”仅三区即交二十余万斤。铁路边某村缴粮时怕车响为敌发觉，将大车轮上缠上麻皮。三区×村送粮时，带上手榴弹，准备随时碰上敌人就打，回去时，自动要上宣传品，回村给群众散发。石庄第三军第七师于清风店被歼后，敌在石庄外围大肆抓丁，每保要二十个，但在我政攻威力下，不少青壮年纷纷逃来我区，我获鹿县府特在边沿区各村广设敌区青年招待所，专门收容逃来之青年。
    【本报太行十五日电】高邑、井陉、赞皇、沙河、内邱等县，翻身农民在解放石庄、攻打元氏的口号下，展开热烈的参军、参战运动。高邑各村听到我部队围困元氏城后，妇女们连夜给部队磨面。徐家庄一夜磨了二千八百斤、磨的又细又白。不足三十户的磨房村，接到区上给反攻军磨面的通知后，全村男女都要争着到区上领麦子，妇女连夜磨，一夜磨好八百斤麦子。东西韩庄的青年一听到打元氏、石庄的消息，纷纷整顿行装、捆绑担架待命出发，南邱村连夜召开参战会。王德富没等散会，即跑回家让他老婆给准备鞋袜，全村整夜在灯光闪烁下，劈片柴，蒸干粮，准备出发。
