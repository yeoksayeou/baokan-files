    [Xinhua News Agency, Su-Lu-Yu-Wan Front, 1st] Chen Yi and Su Yu's counter-offensive army is launching a land reform study during its military advance. Generals Chen Yi and Tang Liang personally delivered in-depth mobilization reports at a meeting of direct unit battalion-level and above cadres on the 17th of this month. The Front Committee also issued instructions again on the 18th, requiring a widespread launch of "speak bitterness" movements among soldiers to recognize the cruel faces of landlords, expose hidden landlord and rich peasant elements, and call on every revolutionary fighter to "turn over" ideologically, support the workers and peasants, and fight for the interests of workers and peasants. Cadres must examine their class and ideology during the land reform study; cadres of landlord and rich peasant origin must abandon their old class stance, obey and support the workers and peasants, and become worker-peasant themselves; old cadres of worker-peasant origin must strengthen their class consciousness, come from the workers and peasants, return to the workers and peasants, and play a backbone role in the study. The instructions emphasized that it is necessary to ensure ideological unity of the entire Party and army in the land reform study, and to patiently persuade and transform. Those who oppose and sabotage will be severely disciplined and purged. This study movement is expected to be preliminarily completed by mid-December.
