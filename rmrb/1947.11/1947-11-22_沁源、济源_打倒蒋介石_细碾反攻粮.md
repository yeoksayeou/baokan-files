　　Qin Yuan, Ji Yuan
　　Defeat Chiang Kai-shek
　　Thoroughly Grind Grain for the Counter-Offensive
　　[Our Newspaper Taiyue Twentieth Dispatch] Wangjiayuan, a model village in Qin Yuan, convened a mass meeting on November 9 to discuss how to quickly hand over grain for the counter-offensive. Village head Zhao Linbao said, "In order to defeat the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, we must hand over public grain quickly, so that we can defeat Chiang Kai-shek quickly." Huo × Yan said: "This year, our village is not burdened with much, because military shoes and summer payments have already accounted for a lot. We proposed to complete it in seven days at the base point village meeting, and it must be fine and good." Everyone excitedly said: "Yes, we guarantee we can do it." Finally, the village's human and animal power was specifically calculated and organized, stipulating fifteen millstones, and no other things were allowed to be milled during the period of milling public grain. The next day, the village's millstones were busy day and night grinding grain for the counter-offensive, and all the public grain was handed over within three days.
　　[Our Newspaper Taiyue Twentieth Dispatch] The Second District of Ji Yuan convened a meeting of village cadres on the first of this month to discuss the payment of grain for the counter-offensive. The poor peasants and hired laborers first expressed: "Although there is a drought and a poor harvest, we still have to pay grain for the counter-offensive. This is for the counter-offensive." On the spot, Guo Zhengxue, the village head of Weigou Village, said: "My family has nine dou of grain. I will pay it first, and then send me as much as I am assigned. This is to defeat Chiang Kai-shek, so that everyone can turn over!" So, the villages challenged each other to pay grain quickly and well. After the meeting adjourned on the evening of the second, the cadres of Nanguanzhuang returned to the village and convened a mass meeting overnight to discuss it. Militia Captain Shang Weiba said: "I will pay one stone of wheat first." Huang Jinhua, chairman of the Women's Rescue Association, also said: "I have one stone and five dou of wheat. I will take it all out, and then supplement it." Under the leadership of eleven cadres in the whole village, they voluntarily reported the payment of public grain, exceeding the prescribed task. Then, Huang Jinhua proposed that tomorrow everyone use a small cart to push one hundred and fifty catties and send it to the district, which promoted the entire masses and they all automatically sent grain. All the grain was prepared that night, and all was sent away on the morning of the third.

    【本报太岳二十日电】沁源模范村王家园于十一月九日召开群众大会，讨论如何快缴反攻粮。村长赵林保说：“我们为了打垮卖国贼蒋介石，要快些交公粮，就能快些把蒋介石打垮。”霍×延说：“今年负担咱村不出多少，因为军鞋和夏款已经顶了许多，咱们在基点村开会时提出七天完成，并且要细要好”大家兴奋的说：“对，保证能做到。”最后将全村人畜力作了具体的计算，组织起来规定十五盘碾，在碾公粮期内不准碾其他东西。第二天全村的碾盘，日夜的忙着细碾反攻粮，三天内即缴完了全部公粮。
    【本报太岳二十日电】济源二区于本月一日召开村干部会议，讨论缴纳反攻粮时，贫雇首先表示：“虽然天旱歉收，但是还要缴纳反攻粮，这是为了反攻。”当场卫沟村长郭正学说：“我家有谷子九斗先缴了，另外派我多少出多少，这是为了打倒蒋介石，大家翻身呀！”于是各村互相挑战，缴粮要快要好。二日晚散会后，南官庄干部回村，连夜召开群众大会讨论，民兵队长商尾巴说：“我先缴一石麦子。”妇救会主席黄金花也说：“我有一石五斗麦子，全拿出来，然后再添补。”在全村十一个干部带头下，自报缴纳公粮，超过了所规定任务。接着，黄金花提出明天一人用小车推一百五十斤，送到区上，推动了全体群众，都自动送粮。当夜便将所有粮食准备好，三日上午全部送完。
