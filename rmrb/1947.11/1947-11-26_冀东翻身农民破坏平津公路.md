Xinhua News Agency, Eastern Hebei, 23rd. Following the partial destruction of the Tianjin-Beijing cement highway between Hexiwu and Nancai by our local armed forces on the 10th, over 300 of our liberated peasants have once again completely destroyed the 25-li section of the highway between these two strongholds, paralyzing this second major transportation line between Tianjin and Beijing for the Chiang bandits. Furthermore, after the victorious attack on Wuqing by our Eastern Hebei local armed forces, the democratic government immediately organized work teams to enter the vast new district between the Bei Canal and the Feng River to establish democratic order. Local residents who had fled from Chiang's disasters have been returning home in droves. The democratic county government has allocated 500 winter garments and several thousand jin of grain to relieve the poor and has organized慰问团 to visit the villages to express sympathy and help them plan production and establish their homes. Land reform has already begun in villages such as Xinfangzi.

　　冀东翻身农民破坏平津公路
    【新华社冀东二十三日电】继十日我地方武装一度破坏平津水泥公路河西务至南蔡交通后，我翻身农民三百余人顷再次将该两据点间全长二十五里的公路完全破坏，使此蒋匪平津间第二条主要交通线变成瘫痪。又我冀东地方武装攻袭武清胜利结束后，民主政府当即组织武工队开入北运河凤河间广大新区建立民主秩序，逃避蒋灾的当地居民已纷纷回家，民主县政府特拨冬衣五百件，粮食数千斤救济贫民，并组织慰问团分赴各村慰问，帮助他们计划生产，建立家务。新房子等村并已开始实行土地改革。
