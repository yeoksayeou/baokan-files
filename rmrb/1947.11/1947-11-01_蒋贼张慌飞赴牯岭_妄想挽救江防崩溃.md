    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: According to an Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 29th, the civil war ringleader Chiang Kai-shek is holding an "important military conference" in Guling to discuss the "Central China war situation" amidst the victorious expansion of the offensive by the People's Liberation Army of Hubei, Henan, and Anhui along the Yangtze River. Traitor Chiang's Minister of National Defense, Bai Chongxi, and other officials are attending the meeting. Chiang flew from Nanjing to Guling on the 27th. At that time, the important Yangtze River towns of Wuxue and Huangmei County had already been liberated by the People's Liberation Army, which controlled 300 li of the river defense, cutting off the important military shipping lanes of the Chiang bandits. Furthermore, the Chiang bandit's 40th Reorganized Division and the 82nd Brigade of the 52nd Reorganized Division were completely annihilated by our Hubei, Henan, and Anhui People's Liberation Army in the area west of Guangji on the 27th. Nanjing's Chiang bandits were greatly shaken by this, so Chiang had no choice but to fly to Guling in a panic that day. According to Reuters, Chiang's trip is intended to "personally arrange" his "Yangtze River defense line," which is already collapsing. The Associated Press stated that Wang Shijie, the Chiang bandit's Minister of Foreign Affairs, who returned to Shanghai from Japan on the 27th, also flew to Guling to meet with Chiang.

    蒋贼张慌飞赴牯岭
    妄想挽救江防崩溃
    【新华社陕北三十日电】据美联社南京二十九日消息：内战匪首蒋介石正在牯岭召开“重要军事会议”，以讨论鄂豫皖人民解放军在长江沿岸胜利扩展攻势中之“华中战局”。蒋匪国防部长白崇禧及其他官员皆出席会议。蒋贼系于二十七日由南京飞往牯岭。当时长江重镇武穴及黄梅县城已被人民解放军解放，并控制长达三百里之江防，切断蒋匪重要军事航运线。而蒋匪之整四十师及整五十二师之八十二旅又于二十七日全部在广济以西地区为我鄂豫皖人民解放军所歼灭，南京蒋匪对此大为震动，故蒋贼不得不于当日仓皇飞赴牯岭。据路透社称：蒋贼此行系拟对其已形崩溃之“长江防线亲作布置。”美联社称：二十七日自日本返上海之蒋匪外交部长王世杰亦曾飞牯岭与蒋贼会晤。
