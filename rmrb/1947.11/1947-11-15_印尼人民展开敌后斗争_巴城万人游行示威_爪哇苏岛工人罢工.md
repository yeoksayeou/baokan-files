　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 11th: The Indonesian people are extensively carrying out anti-Dutch struggles in the Dutch-occupied areas. Earlier this month, Indonesian workers and farmers held a demonstration in Batavia, the heart of Dutch territory, with over ten thousand participants. The demonstrators demanded that the Security Council and the Tripartite Mediation Committee stop the Dutch aggression against Indonesia and chanted slogans such as "Dutch troops withdraw from Indonesian territory." In the areas occupied by the Dutch, all Indonesian people remain loyal to the anti-Japanese Republic of Indonesia government. Workers and farmers are unwilling to be enslaved by the Dutch. In Java and Sumatra, more than 90% of the workers are on strike. Transportation to cities in many areas has been cut off, isolating the Dutch invading forces. Various parties and social organizations in Borneo have vehemently protested against the Dutch conspiracy to divide Indonesia by using a small number of Indonesian traitors. Hasyim, the Deputy Minister of the Economy of the Republic of Indonesia, revealed that American imperialism is colluding with the Dutch to plunder Indonesia's wealth. However, he pointed out that the Netherlands is weak, which is why it is selling the independence of the Indonesian people to the United States in exchange for US dollars.

　　印尼人民展开敌后斗争
  　巴城万人游行示威
  　爪哇苏岛工人罢工
    【新华社陕北十一日电】印尼人民在荷占区广泛开展抗荷斗争。印尼工人与农民本月初曾在荷兰心脏地区之巴城举行示威游行，参加者达万余人，示威者向安理会及三国调停委员会要求制止荷兰侵略印尼，并高呼“荷军撤出印尼国境”等口号。在荷方所霸占地区中，印尼全体人民仍尽忠于抗战的共和国政府。工人与农民均不愿为荷兰人奴役，在爪哇与苏岛有百分之九十以上的工人正在罢工，许多地区通达城市的交通已被切断，使荷兰侵略军陷入孤立之境。婆罗洲各党派与社会团体对荷兰利用印尼少数叛徒进行分裂印尼之阴谋，表示猛烈抗议。印尼共和国经济部次长哈西摩揭露称：美帝国主义正与荷兰狼狈为奸，攫夺印尼的财富，但是，他指出：荷兰是衰弱的，这就是为什么它出卖印尼人民的独立给美国，以换取美元的原因。
