　　Emphasizing Technology, Saving Labor, and Increasing Production
　　Agricultural Experts in Pingshun Gather to Summarize Experiences
　　[Our Newspaper Pingshun News] In order to summarize and exchange experiences in implementing agricultural techniques over the past year and the achievements made, the county first conducted enthusiastic evaluations in various districts and villages in mid-October. On November 3rd, the county specifically convened a meeting of forty-three technical experts to lay the foundation for technical guidance and widespread implementation next year. During the two days of group discussions and typical speeches at the conference, facts demonstrated that the increased production campaign had achieved great results due to the implementation of technical guidance. For example, Anyang Village implemented comprehensive technical guidance, resulting in an increase of 380 shi of grain for the entire village. The Yanggao Technical Committee studied methods for carrying water and planting millet by borrowing land plots. Over 500 mu of millet in the village were successfully planted, resulting in an increase of 1.5 shi of grain per mu. A small number of people who did not believe in technology waited until after the rain to plant, which was too late, resulting in a decrease of 3-4 dou of grain per mu. Chuandi used a two-legged drill, saving over 700 workdays in weeding. The county farm created a wide-blade hoe suitable for the two-legged drill, saving more than one workday per mu. The main experiences in studying the implementation of technology are: 1. Close combination of the Technical Committee and mutual aid teams: In Anyang Technical Committee, the fifteen members were the technical instructors for the thirteen teams. Each member regularly worked with a fixed team, collecting mass experiences from the bottom up at any time and place. Before certain agricultural activities (such as delivering manure and sowing seeds), they would study these experiences and combine them with scientific knowledge (such as the Farmer's Handbook), and then implement them from the top down to the broad masses. 2. Grasp the masses' desire to increase production and become wealthy, and implement ideological leadership in technology. The Shadi Zhan Technical Committee decided that each plant should be spaced two and a half to three feet apart when hoeing the Jin Huanghou variety. However, XXX was afraid that the seedlings would be too sparse and affect the yield. Lao Ying and Li Shunda seized on this idea and told him, "Dense seedlings will reduce the yield. Spacing them two and a half to three feet apart is just right and guarantees a higher yield. If the yield is lower, I will take responsibility." As a result, the yield increased by more than two shi of grain after the autumn harvest. 3. The Technical Committee removed landlords and rich peasants and allowed poor and hired peasants to take power, because poor and hired peasants are true to their word. As long as it can increase production and wealth, they will actively lead the masses to do it. The members of the Chuandi Technical Committee were all liberated peasants. During the drought, they studied methods for repairing canals and watering seedlings, and immediately promoted the repair of 172 canals throughout the village. After removing the rich peasants, the Anyang Technical Committee became more consolidated and united. As Cui Fubao said, "The rich peasants are not of one mind with us, they are completely useless. The middle peasants need to be pushed to act, otherwise they won't move. It is necessary for poor people to lead." 4. Technical contracting and work conversion, stimulating technological improvement through wage increases and decreases. For example, Shannandi set standards for weeding. Those who weeded well would receive more points, and those who weeded poorly would receive fewer points. This made everyone more enthusiastic and重视 to improve technology. After the summary, the following tasks were proposed for the Technical Committee this winter: 1. Mobilize the masses to accumulate manure in manure pits, completely covering it with soil; 2. Build toilets; 3. Protect trees and forests. After the discussion, everyone was in high spirits and put forward many specific methods to ensure that these three things were done well.

　　讲究技术省工增产
  　平顺农业能手集会总结经验
    【本报平顺讯】为了总结交流一年来贯澈农业技术的经验及成绩，首先经过十月中旬各区村的热烈评选，于十一月三日，县特召开四十三个技术能手会议，以便给明年的技术指导与贯澈普遍打下基础。两天的小组座谈与大会典型发言中，事实说明，由于贯澈技术指导，使增产运动已获很大成绩，如安阳村，贯澈全体技术指导，全村增产三百八十石。阳高技委会研究担水、借垧点种谷等办法，全村五百多亩谷捉住苗，每亩多收粮一石五；少数因不相信技术，等雨后种，时间过迟，每亩少收三、四斗。川底使用两条腿耧，锄苗省工七百多。县农场创造适用两条腿耧的宽板锄，每亩省工一个多。在研究贯澈技术上的主要经验：一、技委会与互助组密切结合：安阳技委会，十五个委员就是十三个组的技术指导员，各委员经常固定一组，随时随地自下而上的搜集群众经验，在一定的农事活动（如送粪下种等……）前研究，再结合科学知识（如庄稼汉手册），自上而下的贯澈到广大群众中去。二、抓住群众增产发家要求积极面，贯澈技术上的思想领导，沙地栈技委会研究锄金皇后时决定每棵方圆距离二尺半到三尺远，而×××只怕留苗稀少打粮，劳英李顺达就抓住这种思想，向他说：“留苗稠要少打粮，按方圆二尺半到三尺远正合适，保险多打粮，如果少打粮我管包。”结果秋后多打粮二石多。三、技委会清除地主、富农，让贫雇当权，因贫雇是说到做到，只要能增产发家，他们就积极领导群众去干。川底技委会的委员都是翻身农民，在抗旱时研究出修渠、浇苗办法，马上推动全村修渠百七十二道；安阳技委会在清除了富农后，更加巩固团结，如崔富保说：“人家富农和咱不一心，根本不行，中农是推推动动，不推不动，非穷人领导不行。”四、技术包工与折工，从工资增减上刺激提高技术，如锄苗时山南底定出标准，锄的好的增分，孬的减分，这样大家对提高技术更热情重视。经总结后，提出今冬技委会工作：一、打粪池动员群众积粪，全部用土压住；二、垒厕所；三、保树保林。讨论后大家情绪很高，提出不少具体办法，保证做好这三件事。（办公室赵春喜）
