　　On-the-Spot Inspection of Autumn Plowing
　　Overcomes Spontaneous Phenomena
　　Strengthen Leadership in Autumn Plowing
　　Qin County Makes Four Special Decisions
[Our Newspaper Taiyue Dispatch, 9th] After Qinshui Chengguan Town actually inspected the autumn plowing, it overcame the spontaneous phenomena and organized all the livestock to plow 3,000 mu of autumn land. After the district cadres discovered that the village cadres had not grasped the leadership of the autumn plowing work, forming a spontaneous phenomenon, they organized a part of the people on October 26 to inspect the fields piece by piece to see how many livestock were plowing the land. Another part went to each household to check whether the livestock were all on the land. The inspection results showed that all seventeen oxen of the three street groups had gone to the land, sixteen of the eighteen oxen of the first street had gone to the land, three of the seven oxen of the second street had gone to the land, and all six livestock of Songjia Kiln were in the garden. In addition to criticism, the district cadres also praised the model of all the livestock in the third street going to the land, and everyone's enthusiasm rose. They also determined that the production committee members of each street should inspect and adjust the plowing cattle of each street, and each street selected plowing cattle captains to lead. Since then, the spontaneous phenomenon in autumn plowing has been overcome, and all 43 livestock of the village have been mobilized.
[Our Newspaper Taiyue Dispatch, 9th] The Qinshui United Office convened a joint meeting of the heads of various agencies and district financial assistants on October 28. In order to implement autumn plowing, the following decisions were made: (1) Cadres at all levels should quickly overcome the relaxation of leadership, allowing spontaneity, and the bureaucratic style of having few cadres, lack of labor, lack of confidence, and disregard for the interests of the masses, clearly recognizing that autumn plowing is the foundation for a year's harvest and two years of effort. As long as it is well organized and the plan is high, the difficulties of less labor and livestock can be overcome. (2) According to the existing conditions, under the principle of voluntariness, speed up the organization, organize autumn plowing teams centered on oxen, and organize land digging and stubble digging teams centered on manpower (men, women, full and semi-labor). (3) Old men and oxen are the main force of autumn plowing, women and children are the main force of stubble digging, and strong young men and women are the main force of land digging. People, land, and work should be organized in advance, distinguishing between priority and skill, calculating scores based on labor, and paying wages based on work, developing the enthusiasm of the masses and involving all forces in the autumn plowing movement. (4) In terms of leadership, we should adhere to carrying out short-term and in-depth mobilization work for cadres, activists, etc., centered on base points. Cadres above the district level should be uniformly organized by the district, assigned to various base points to lead autumn plowing, and organize mobile inspection teams to conduct inspections, so that cadres' leadership areas are fixed, positions are clear, tasks are specific, and they are effectively responsible. In addition, the criteria for meritorious service in autumn plowing are stipulated: 1. Those who organize autumn plowing exceeding the task requirements, especially the autumn plowing land of military cadres and revolutionary martyrs' families and the families of militiamen and laborers participating in the war, should be treated the same as households with livestock. 2. Those who extensively organize manpower and livestock to implement mutual assistance, work exchange, or equivalent exchange, and cadres, especially village cadres, who personally participate in mutual assistance, take the lead in digging land and digging stubble, and play a certain role.

    【本报太岳九日电】沁源联合办公室于十月二十八日召开各机关各区长财政助理员联合会议，为贯澈秋垡特作如下决定：（一）对秋垡工作各级干部应迅速克服放松领导听任自流，和干部少，劳力缺乏，没有信心，以及漠视群众利益的官僚主义作风，明确认识秋垡地是一年庄稼两年闹的基础，只要组织好，计划高，劳畜力少的困难就可克服。（二）根据现有条件，在自愿原则下加紧组织，以牛犋为中心组织秋垡小组，以人力为中心（男女全半劳力）组织刨地刨茬小组。（三）老汉和牛犋是秋垡的主力，妇女和儿童是刨茬的主力，劳力较强的青壮男女是刨地的主力，事先应组织人，组织地，组织活分别先后轻重巧拙，按劳评分，按活计工，发扬群众的积极性，使所有力量都卷入秋垡运动。（四）领导上应坚持进行短期而深入的以基点为中心的干部积极分子等的动员工作，区级以上的干部由区统一组织，分配各基点领导秋垡，并组织流动检查组，进行检查，务使干部领导地区固定化，岗位明确，任务具体，切实负责。此外又规定秋垡立功标准：一、组织秋垡超过任务要求者，特别是对军干烈属和参战民兵民工家中之秋垡地要做到和有畜户一样。二、大量组织人力畜力实行互助变工或等价交换者，干部特别是村干部亲自参加互助，带头刨地刨茬，起一定作用者。
