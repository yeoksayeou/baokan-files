　　Masses Consciously Join the Army to Eliminate Chiang
  　The Conscription Movement in the Fourth District of Changzhi
    In the 39 administrative villages of the Fourth District of Changzhi, more than 700 people voluntarily signed up to join the army. After a mass review, more than 500 people were sent to the district; after four reviews by the district, 476 people were finally retained, exceeding the original plan of 300 people.

    Everyone believes that this conscription situation is unprecedented and unexpected. Its characteristics: "Short time, high quality, good morale, little waste." Why can such results be achieved? There are the following basic experiences:

    I. Start with current affairs education, use comparison and accounting methods to enlighten the masses' consciousness, and create a conscription upsurge.

    In this conscription movement, current affairs education was carried out from top to bottom, and questions such as how to win and how to protect the good times were raised for the masses to discuss. At the Henghe mass meeting, a heated discussion was launched. Cai Shuren said, "If you can't bear the child, you can't catch the wolf. If you want to get rid of the root of the disaster, join the army." He signed up and mobilized others. Twenty people signed up in the village overnight. Eighteen Palm Village raised questions such as "Are landlords good? Who do landlords rely on? What should happen to Chiang Kai-shek? Who will fight?" Continuous enlightenment and guidance led to twenty-eight sign-ups in one day. In this enthusiastic movement, many conscription stories emerged, such as Grandma Li Bao, 76 years old, from Mowanling, sending her grandson, Che Haitang from Dongzhuang persuading her husband, and Chen Xiawang's mother from Nei Wang persuading her son.

    In addition to generally solving the masses' thinking, the following specific thoughts were also resolved: First, greed for life and fear of death; second, the difficulty of separation between husband and wife; and third, filial piety to parents. The solution generally adopted the method of comparison and accounting to enlighten class consciousness. For example, when Xi Huo solved these problems, Li Jieyun reflected and said: "In the years of famine, my family also had parents, wives, and children. We were so hungry that we had to flee everywhere. I fled to Wucun for more than a year and didn't dare to go home. I carried iron goods for a villager from Huguan × Laocun. I didn't dare to go home even though I was only ten miles away. Why didn't I show filial piety then? How could I bear to part with my wife and children then?" He affirmed: "Only by defeating the bandit Chiang can all this be talked about." Liu Ruiting from Yincheng proposed: "If you want to achieve both loyalty and filial piety, young people must join the army." Wang Renkui from Beidazhang had his brother already in the army last time, and he signed up this time. His sister-in-law said to him: "Fangcheng, if Chiang Kai-shek is not defeated, the whole family cannot be reunited, go!"

    II. Party members, cadres, and activists take the lead in pushing the movement to a climax.

    Solving ideological problems is not the same as action. In the period of hesitation, how to step forward depends on the leadership of Party members, cadres, and activists. After the mobilization meeting in Xi Huo, some people understood, but everyone was looking at each other, and no one was willing to take the lead. Li Jieyun was the first to sign up, followed by thirty-three others. The father of the director of the Wu Committee in Dayu said, "Sheep must be grazed by themselves, and operas must be sung by themselves. Do your own thing," and said to his son Zhongtang, "Zhongtang, go." After Zhongtang signed up, more than 30 others continued to sign up. This proves that the leadership of Party members and cadres plays a decisive role. However, dispelling their concerns and clarifying their thinking beforehand is an important part of leadership.

    III. Check preferential treatment for military families and substitute farming, use retired soldiers and old military dependents to create a mass mutual persuasion movement. Solving practical difficulties is also an important issue in conscription work. Villages such as Qiaotou Liangjiazhuang checked the past preferential treatment for military families and substitute farming, and found three types of people and three types of thinking: One type was assigned to substitute farming but were not active. This type of people reviewed and found that they did not realize that joining the army was for our own benefit, thinking it was the same as being sent on errands. The second type went when they were asked to go, without haggling over the price, and reviewed that it was because they had to go, it was an order from above. The third type actively solved any difficulties that military dependents had. This type of people reviewed and said: "He is fighting for us in the front, and we are for him in the rear. This is what we should do." After the inspection, some villagers proposed guarantees and signed contracts with military dependents. In this way, the new soldiers increased their enthusiasm for joining the army and reduced their worries. The old military dependents were also very happy. This greatly reduced expenses. Many military dependents also actively mobilized others for their children and husbands to return home soon. When Wang Taihe's wife and mother, military dependents in Zhongcun, mobilized Wang Renhu, Guo Xiuhai, and Feng Erfeng to join the army, they said: "Taihe joined the Eighth Route Army long ago, and you have been sworn brothers since you were young. Why don't you work together and add to his strength so that he can return home soon." Later, influenced by the three of them, nineteen people in the village signed up, eight of whom were mobilized by Taihe's mother. Gou Chouhai from Juzhai Village planned to join the army, but his mother was afraid that he would be beaten in the army. After Gou Peifang, a retired soldier, talked about the equal life in the army, his thinking was cleared, and Chouhai signed up. A soldier from Shitan Yu who returned on leave mobilized three people to join the army. Che Haitang from Dongzhuang, in addition to mobilizing her husband, also cleared her sister's thinking, and her sister in turn mobilized her husband. In this way, a mass conscription movement was formed in which relatives persuaded relatives and friends persuaded friends to break the old idea that "good people don't become soldiers" and form a conscription upsurge in which good people want to become soldiers.

### 群众自觉参军灭蒋　长治四区的参军运动

　　群众自觉参军灭蒋
  　长治四区的参军运动
    长治四区三十九个行政村，自动报名参军者达七百余人。经群众性的审查，送区者共有五百余人；再经区上四次审查，最后还留下四百七十六人，超出了原来三百人的计划。
    这次参军情况大家认为空前未有，出乎意料。其特点：“时间短，质量高，情绪好，浪费小。”为甚么能获得这样的成绩？有以下几点基本经验：
    一、从时事教育着手，用对比算帐的方式启发群众自觉，造成参军热潮。
    这次参军运动，自上而下的经过了时事教育，提出怎样能胜利，怎样保时光等问题让群众讨论，横河群众大会上热烈展开讨论，蔡书仁说：“舍不得孩子打不住狼，想刨祸根把军参。”他报了名，还动员别人。该村一夜报名二十人。十八掌提出：“地主好不好？地主仗凭谁？蒋介石该怎样？谁去打？”等问题，连续启发引导，一天报名二十八人。在此热火朝天的运动中，出现了不少象磨王岭七十六岁的李保奶奶送孙、东庄车海棠劝夫、内王陈夏旺之母劝子等参军故事。
    除此以外，在一般的解决群众思想之下，并解决了以下几个具体思想：一是贪生怕死；二是夫妻难舍；三是守孝父母。解决的办法，普遍采取了对比算帐方法启发阶级自觉。如西火在解决这些问题时李接运反省说：“灾荒年我家也有父母妻子，饿的没法四处逃散，我逃到吴村一年多，不敢回家，给人家来壶关×牢村担铁货，离家十里未敢回家，那时怎不孝顺哩？那时怎舍得老婆孩子呢？”他肯定地说：“只有打倒蒋贼，这一切才能谈到。”荫城刘瑞亭提出：“想要得到忠孝全，青年必须把军参。”北大掌王仁魁他哥上次就已参了军，他这次也报了名，他嫂向他说：“方成，不打倒蒋介石全家不能团圆，你去吧！”
    二、党员干部积极分子，带头把运动推向高潮。
    思想问题的解决不等于行动，在徘徊不定时期，如何挺身而出，决定于党员、干部、积极分子的带头，西火在大会动员以后，有些人是通了，可是大眼看小眼，谁也不肯打头炮。李接运首先报名，随后报名的三十三人。大峪武委会主任父亲说：“羊要自放，戏要自唱，自己事情自己干，”和他儿子忠唐说：“忠唐你去。”忠唐报名后，继续报名三十多人。从此证明，党员、干部带头是起决定作用的。可是事先解除他们的顾虑，打通他们的思想，这是领导上重要的一环。
    三、检查优抗代耕，运用荣退军人旧军属，造成群众性的互劝运动。解决实际困难亦是参军工作中的重要问题。桥头梁家庄等村检查了过去优抗代耕，发现出三种人三种思想：一种是派他去代耕，不积极。这种人检讨出没有认清参军是给咱干，以为和支差一样。第二种是叫去就去，不讲价钱，检讨出是因为不去不行，上级命令。第三种人是主动的看见军属有什么困难就去解决，这种人检讨说：“他在前方为了咱，咱在后方就为他，这是应该的。”检查以后有些村群众提出保证，和军属订立合同。这样新战士增加了参军的积极性，减少了顾虑。旧军属也高兴万分。这样大大减少了开支。许多军属也为自己孩子丈夫早日回来，积极的动员别人。中村军属老婆王太和娘动员王仁虎、郭秀孩、冯二风参军时说：“太和早已参加八路军，你们从小即是烧香弟兄，还不一齐干，给他去加上一把，让他也早日回来。”后来在他三个人影响下，全村报名十九人，其中有八人是太和娘动员过的。璩寨村苟臭孩打算参军，他母亲说怕他到军队上挨打，荣退军人苟培芳谈了部队上平等生活以后，思想通了，臭孩报了名。石炭峪一个请假回来的军人，一人动员了三人参军。东庄车海棠除动员了自己丈夫以外，还打通了自己妹妹思想，他的妹妹又动员了自己丈夫。这样就形成了亲戚劝亲戚，朋友劝朋友的群众性参军运动，来打破了“好人不当兵”的旧思想，形成好人要当兵的参军热潮。”
