Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 25th: A certain unit of the Democratic Allied Forces convened a meeting of political work cadres on the 11th to summarize the war review movement and formulate methods and steps for carrying out this movement in the future. The meeting reviewed that this work has not yet become a heated mass movement. The main reasons are: cadres and soldiers do not fully understand the basic meaning of war review, which is a most profound, concrete, and effective educational method for promoting criticism and self-criticism, summarizing experience, and rapidly improving combat effectiveness. Cadres failed to personally participate in leadership, grasp typical examples, and promote others. A few cadres were afraid of criticism and did not actively promote and lead. In carrying out the movement, they failed to grasp the key points, reviewing everything, and lacked specific methods, not knowing where to start. Regarding carrying out this movement in the future, the unanimous opinion is: first, open up thinking from top to bottom, correct vague views, conduct full deliberation through activists, use the exemplary role of cadres to induce everyone to comment, and then unfold from top to bottom. The tendency to simply criticize subordinates should be avoided, democracy should be fully promoted, and typical demonstrations should be consciously created. In terms of organizational leadership, the Party committee should uniformly lead and control the movement, the political organs should provide specific leadership, and the staff organs should help promote it. In terms of steps, according to the different situations of the companies, select key points and centers, then investigate "why" to find out various reasons (good and bad), further find out who is responsible (展開互相批評 [展开互相批评] – launch mutual criticism), and finally propose "what to do"? The content of the war review movement should have key points, that is, soldiers should focus on technical actions, and cadres should focus on tactical command. During non-combat periods, reviews should be conducted on marching, guarding, camping, reconnaissance, discipline, and policies.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 25th: Branch reporter Wang Jun reported: A certain unit in Liaodong generally adopts the following four methods in conducting war reviews: (1) Each company conducts a review based on its own tasks and the problems that occurred in the battle, according to the specific situation. For example, the 9th Company of this unit reviewed a certain siege battle. Everyone studied the terrain, the ground features, and the company commander's command of the attack at that time, and believed that it was successful because it was good at selecting a breakthrough, but the second echelon suffered greater casualties because the instructor did not understand the situation and the troops failed to disperse and advance. (2) Defend based on the difficult questions raised by the soldiers. In the discipline review of a certain company, the deputy squad leader of the second squad proposed: "When I saw the enemy fleeing from behind the bunker, I led the whole squad to insert into the enemy's rear without receiving an order. This is a violation of discipline." Everyone debated this. It was believed that when the enemy retreated, they were in chaos and could not deploy firepower, so it was right to pursue them, which was maneuvering, not disobeying orders. (3) Make comparisons with different examples. When reviewing the combination of command and maneuvering, squad leader Xu Guangbo cited the order given to him by the deputy platoon leader: "I want you to resolutely take down this bunker, if you don't take it down, I'll shoot you!" Therefore, he was frightened by this order at the time. On the contrary, the order issued by another instructor was: "Deputy Squad Leader, you have always been brave. If you can take down this bunker, you will definitely be credited." The deputy squad leader was very happy to go forward. (4) Self-criticism. For example, a soldier from the 9th Company made a self-review saying: I carried the colored flag off the battlefield, in fact, I wanted to escape.

### 发扬批评与自我批评　总结经验提高战斗力  民主联军大力贯澈战评教育

　　发扬批评与自我批评
  　总结经验提高战斗力
    民主联军大力贯澈战评教育
    【新华社东北前线二十五日电】民主联军某部十一日召集各部政工干部总结战评运动，拟订今后开展此项运动的办法与步骤。会议上检讨出这一工作仍未成为一个热烈的群众运动，其主要原因在于：干部与战士没有充分了解战评的基本意义，乃是发扬批评与自我批评，总结经验和迅速提高战斗力的一种最深刻具体有效的教育方法。干部未能亲身参加领导，掌握典型，推动其他。少数干部害怕批评，不积极推动和领导。在开展运动中抓不住重点，什么都评，且缺少具体办法，不知从何着手。对今后开展这一运动，一致的意见是：首先自上而下的打通思想，纠正模糊的看法，通过积极分子进行充分酝酿，以干部的示范作用，诱导大家进行评论，然后再自上而下展开，要避免单纯评下级的倾向，充分发扬民主，并有意识创造典型示范。在组织领导上应由党委统一领导掌握运动，政治机关作具体领导，参谋机关帮助推动。在步骤上根据不同连队情况，选择重点和中心，再追究“为什么”进而找出各种原因（好的和坏的），进一步找出谁负责（展开互相批评），最后提出“怎样办”？战评运动的内容应有重点，即战士应以技术动作，干部应以战术指挥为主。非战斗期间应就行军、警戒、宿营、侦察、纪律、政策各方面进行评论。
    【新华社东北二十五日电】分社记者王军报导：辽东某部在进行战评中一般采用下列四种方法：（一）每个连根据本身任务与战斗中发生的问题，按具体情况进行检讨。如该部九连评论某次攻坚，大家研究了当时的地形、地物及当时连长对进攻的指挥，认为因善于选择突破而成功，但第二梯队因指导员不了解情况，致部队未能疏散前进，伤亡较大。（二）根据战士提出的疑难问题进行辩解。某连在评纪律中二班长提出：“当我看见敌人从地堡后逃跑时，没有接到命令就率领全班插到敌人后侧，这是不遵守纪律。”大家就此展开辩论。认为敌人退却时混乱，火力展不开，正好追击，这是机动，并不是不执行命令。（三）以不同的例子作对比。在评指挥与机动结合时，班长徐光波举出排副给他的命令：“要你坚决打下这个地堡，打不下来枪毙你！”因此当时曾被这个命令吓住。相反另一指导员下达的命令是：“班副，你是素来勇敢，你如能把这个地堡打下来，一定立功”，该班副就很高兴的上前去了。（四）自我批评。如九连某战士自我检讨说：我背彩号下战场，其实是想逃跑。
