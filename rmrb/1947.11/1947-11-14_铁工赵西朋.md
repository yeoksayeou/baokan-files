　　Ironworker Zhao Xipeng
    Jun Qian
    Zhao Xipeng is thirty-six years old, from Luji in the second district of Fan County. His family has four members, and originally only had two mu of land. During the Anti-Japanese War, with the support of the democratic government, they gradually increased it to nine mu. He started learning ironwork at the age of seventeen, and later opened a rickshaw shop and blacksmith shop in Luji. Because he was smart and keen on research, he learned the technique of making guns. In 1943, he worked in the No. 1 Arsenal of the military region to make guns. He only came to the Puyang County Shipyard to work as an ironworker on the 15th day of the third month of the lunar calendar this year. When he first arrived at the shipyard, Old Zhang was the leader of the ironworking team and also a model ironworker. Zhao Xipeng was determined to compete with Old Zhang and decided to follow Old Zhang's example for a while. At that time, both he and Old Zhang were at the blast furnace, first refining iron bars and then transferring them to the low furnace to make castings for the ship. On the first day, Old Zhang made eighteen jin of iron bars, and he made twenty-six jin. Old Zhang saw that he was a strong competitor and was afraid that he would catch up. The next day, he put in more effort and made thirty-seven jin, and Zhao Xipeng made thirty-six jin. From then on, no matter how much Old Zhang increased his daily output, he always consciously made a little less than Old Zhang. Old Zhang was always afraid of being caught up or surpassed by him, so he kept working hard. Zhao Xipeng kept chasing closely without letting go. After thirteen days of competition, Old Zhang went home, and he was elected as the leader, leading the thirty ironworkers of eight blast furnaces and nine low furnaces to work. Zhao Xipeng often said to everyone: "For the sake of taming the Yellow River and defeating Old Chiang, we must use all our strength." At first, the workers who came from various places often haggled over treatment, food, and drink. Under his exemplary role, the awareness of the general workers has now been raised, and they can all work actively without caring about treatment, food, and drink. Through his careful research, the high furnace for making iron bars could only produce more than twenty jin per furnace per day before, but now it has increased to more than fifty jin. For making iron castings, the low furnace could only produce seventy or eighty pieces per plate per day before, but now it has increased to more than one hundred and seventy pieces. Moreover, he cherishes public property very much, and always picks up the scrap iron that falls on the ground. Before, everyone did not repair the furnaces much, which was a waste of coal; after he came, he often asked everyone to repair the furnaces and make the furnace grooves narrower, which could save more than thirty jin of coal every day. These are not all, and the most prominent thing is his improvement and creation of technology: 1. Transforming iron hammers – the iron hammers used by ironworkers before were often not durable. The reason for the lack of durability is that a part of steel needs to be added to the top of the hammer. That part of the steel is made into a cake and attached to the top. This piece of steel often falls off due to severe vibration. Zhao Xipeng grinds the steel into strips, coils three pieces on the top of the hammer, wedges a nail in the center of the iron strip, and heats it red with fire, then hammers the iron strip and nail with a hammer. The iron at the top drills into the steel strip, and the two are interlocked. When this kind of hammer is used with force, the steel top will no longer fall off due to vibration. 2. Cutting iron rails – To use iron rails to make iron bars and nail castings, they need to be cut into sections; but cutting this kind of thing is extremely laborious. It is not easy to cut off without burning it with fire or if the fire is not hot enough. If it is burned too much with fire, it will be difficult to cut because it is softened by burning. Zhao Xipeng researched that it is extremely effortless to cut iron rails when they are burned to the point where they cannot be held by hand. This saves coal. When others cut iron rails before, they needed to use hundreds of jin of coal every day, but he can save more than thirty jin. 3. Transforming anchor heads – The anchor heads on ships are not easy to make. The anchor heads made by many people are often useless, that is, because the teeth on the pseudo-anchor heads are not bent enough at an angle, they cannot grab the ground when the anchor is dropped, and even if they grab the ground, the teeth are often broken. If the bend is too much, it will slip and not hold the ground. The first anchor made by Zhao Xipeng was useless, and he felt ashamed, so he made up his mind to transform it well. He took a ruler and quietly went to the ship, carefully measuring the usable anchors and the anchors he made, and studied more than thirty anchor heads. Finally, he found the root cause. The usable anchor has a handle length of two chi, the angle of the middle tooth is such that the tip of the tooth is six and a half cun from the handle, the tip of the two side teeth is five cun five fen from the handle, and the tip of the lifting ring is four cun five fen from the handle; and the teeth he made himself are not bent enough, and the tip of the middle tooth is eight cun from the handle. After he came back and transformed what he made, it became useful. Therefore, this year he repaired more than fifty anchors, and none of them were useless. (Jilu Yu Branch)

　　铁工赵西朋
    君谦
    赵西朋三十六岁，范县二区陆集人，家中人四口，原来只有二亩地，抗日期间，在民主政府扶植下，才逐渐增加到九亩地。他从十七岁即学铁工，后来在陆集开过洋车铺和铁匠炉等买卖，因为他聪明，又富有研究性，就学会了造枪的技术。一九四三年到军区军工厂一所造过枪，至今年旧历三月十五日，才到濮县造船厂做铁工。他刚到造船厂时，大老张是铁工组长，也是个铁工模范，赵西朋就一心要和大老张比赛，决定先追着大老张干一段。那时候他和大老张都是在高炉上，先炼铁条再转给低炉打造船的铸子。第一天大老张打铁条一十八斤，他就打了二十六斤。大老张看他是个劲手，怕他追上了。第二天加劲就打了三十七斤，赵西朋就打了卅六斤，从此以后，不管大老张每天增加到多大数量，他总有意识的做的比大老张只差一点，大老张老是怕被他追上或超过了自己，一个劲的加油，赵西朋也就一个劲的紧追着不放松，一气比赛了十三天，大老张回家后，他就被大家选为组长，领导八盘高炉和九盘低炉的三十铁工干起来。赵西朋常对大家说：“为了治黄河，为了打老蒋，咱要有多大劲使多大劲。”起初从各地集合来的工人，常要计较待遇，吃喝，在他的模范作用之下，现在一般工人的觉悟都提高了，都能积极工作而不计较待遇与吃喝了。经他的细心研究，打铁条的高炉以前每天每炉只能打二十多斤，现在已增到五十多斤。打铁铸子，低炉以前每盘每天只能打七、八十个，现在已增加到一百七十多个，而且他又很爱惜公物，随时将落在地上的碎铁收拾起来。以前大家不大修整炉子，很浪费煤；他来后常叫大家修理炉子，将炉槽做得窄一些，每天便能节省三十多斤煤，这些还不算，而最突出的，则是他对于技术的改良与创造：一、改造铁锤——以前铁工用的铁锤，常不耐用。不耐用的原因，是由于锤顶需要加一部分钢，那部分钢是做成一块饼子贴在顶上的，这块钢常因剧烈的震动而掉了。赵西朋则将钢仲碾成条后，盘三块在锤顶上铁条的中心再楔上一个钉，用火一齐烧红后，再用锤将铁条及钉一锤，顶的铁便钻入钢条里，两两一交键，这种锤用力使用时，钢顶再不会因震动而脱落了。二、截铁轨——用铁轨打铁条、打钉铸，需要把他截成一段段的；但截这种东西，却极费劲，不用火烧或烧得不到火候，固然不易截断，如用火烧得过了，也因烧软而不好截。赵西朋研究出用铁轨烧到手不能拿的程度，截起来便极省力了。这样又省了煤，以前别人截铁轨时，每天要用百斤煤，他却能省三十余斤。三、改造锚头——船上的锚头，是不容易造的，许多人造的锚头，每每不管用，即是因伪锚头上的齿如弯得不够角度，抛锚时便抓不着地，纵抓住地，也常投断了齿。弯得过了限度，便又打滑，也把不住地。赵西朋初次造的锚不管用，他感觉得丢脸，就下决心要将它改造好，拿着尺子，悄悄走到船上，细心度量管用的锚和自己造的锚，研究了三十多个锚头，终于找到了病根。原来管用的锚，柄长二尺，中齿弯的角度齿尖距柄是六寸半，两个边齿的尖头距柄是五寸五分，提环的尖头距柄是四寸五分；而自己造的各齿则弯度不够，中齿尖头距柄有八寸。回来将自己造的一改造，就管用了。因而，今年他修了五十多个锚，没有一个不管用的。（冀鲁豫分社）
