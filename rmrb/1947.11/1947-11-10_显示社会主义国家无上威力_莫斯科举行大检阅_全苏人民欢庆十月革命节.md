Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: Moscow News: The Soviet people celebrated the 30th anniversary of the October Revolution yesterday with great jubilation. Moscow was completely adorned anew, with red flags and colorful banners interspersed with green pines and cypresses, creating a brilliant spectacle. Images of Lenin, Stalin, and leaders from the Party, military, and government were prominently displayed in major streets and squares. From early morning, people from the suburbs flocked to Red Square to witness the parade. As Molotov, Shvernik, Beria, Andreyev, Malenkov, and other Party, government, and military leaders ascended the reviewing stand atop Lenin's Mausoleum, the crowds removed their hats and cheered, with applause like thunder. Also on the reviewing stand were veteran Bolsheviks who participated in the uprising thirty years ago, labor heroes from Stalin's Five-Year Plans, renowned generals from the war against Germany, as well as prominent scientists, artists, writers, foreign guests, diplomatic envoys, and foreign journalists. Shortly after, as the giant clock on the Kremlin's bell tower chimed, Marshal Bulganin, the Minister of Armed Forces of the Soviet Union, appeared on horseback outside the Kremlin, amidst cheers, and proceeded along the front of the formations, before ascending the reviewing stand to deliver a speech. After the speech, a massive orchestra of 1,300 musicians played the Soviet national anthem, followed by a 24-gun salute, marking the commencement of the grand parade for the 30th anniversary of the October Revolution. Leading the parade were cadets from the Frunze Military Academy, many of whom were decorated officers with outstanding contributions from the battles fought from Stalingrad to the gates of Berlin. Following them were artillery units, armored units, the air force, engineers, chemical warfare units, and so on. As the formations marched past the crowds, enthusiastic cheers and applause erupted. The motorcade of armored units was so extensive that it filled Red Square, and the searchlights on the long-range cannons illuminated all directions, displaying the unparalleled power of the socialist state. After the parade, citizens dispersed to various locations for sightseeing. Every theater had captivating programs, and the streets and squares were filled with people singing and dancing, causing traffic jams. The open-air grand chorus held in the Fifty-Third Square involved over ten thousand musicians from Moscow's various theaters and Soviet republics. The world-renowned Moscow subway was decorated with fresh flowers, and orchestras played music for the passengers. The National Lenin Library held an exhibition on "Thirty Years of Soviet Literature." In the evening, the elaborate light displays crafted by architects and technicians competed in splendor, creating a magnificent spectacle. On the giant building opposite the Kremlin, on the left side of Red Square, a floral crown composed of 23,000 electric lights enveloped Moscow, the city that never sleeps, in a radiant rain of fireworks.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: Nanjing News: On the 7th, the 30th anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution, Soviet Embassy Chargé d'affaires Mr. and Mrs. Fedlin held a cocktail reception at 6:00 PM to celebrate, with over 300 Chinese and foreign guests in attendance.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: Moscow News: The Soviet people, with a hundredfold confidence and unparalleled joy, will celebrate the solemn festival of the 30th anniversary of the October Revolution. Grand commemorative gatherings will be held throughout the country. Across the vast territory from the Baltic Sea to Kamchatka, from factories to collective farms, from villages to cities, countless exhibitions, athletic competitions, concerts, dances, and banquets will take place today. The Soviet people will review the fruits of their labor and receive accolades for their victories. In the capital, Moscow, a magnificent military parade will be held in Red Square today, with the newly promoted Marshal of the Soviet Union Bulganin, the Minister of Armed Forces of the Soviet Union, serving as the reviewing officer. New plays will be staged in theaters throughout Moscow and the Soviet Union, and music academies will perform new works. For example, the two operas completed by Leningrad writer Desevov a month ago, "The Military Glory of the Soviet People" and Tsiako's "Great Power," as well as the opera "Victory" composed by Armenian composer Coveiti Sim, will all be premiered with great fanfare. The Moscow Writers' Central Club began holding the exhibition "Soviet Literature Abroad, 1941-1947" on the 4th, including 1,500 works by 230 Soviet writers published in 35 foreign countries, fully demonstrating the elevated status of Soviet literature internationally. The Soviet Publishing Bureau has specially published a massive series of twelve volumes, including 100 famous Soviet novels, with a planned print run of 10 million copies. Simultaneously, the 640-page monumental work "The Academy of Sciences Since the Founding of the Soviet Union," summarizing the development and achievements of Soviet science, will also be published.
