Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 2nd dispatch: To cooperate with the People's Liberation Army in wiping out the Chiang Kai-shek/Hu Zongnan bandit troops that have invaded the interior of the border region, local armed forces, militia, and guerrillas in various parts of the border region are competing to capture and annihilate bandit troops. When the Chiang Kai-shek bandits entrenched in the isolated city of Suide abandoned the city and fled south on the 12th of last month, the Suide local armed guerrillas immediately followed closely, and in the Shizuiyi area, 70 li south of Suide, killed ten enemies including Li Hongbao, the puppet county chief of Suide, and Li Teng, the puppet education section chief, and captured alive the Suide Sha District puppet district chief, the Mizhi Nanguan puppet town chief, and more than 1,500 people who had been captured by the enemy. On the 3rd of last month, the Zhenchuan local armed forces defeated the invading Yulin Chiang Kai-shek self-defense forces and, taking advantage of the victory, pursued and recovered Sancha Bay south of Yulin city. At the beginning of last month, the Yan'an Gulin guerrillas captured two enemy company commanders and nearly 50 soldiers alive in the battles to recover Yanchuan and Yanchang. The Yan'an Fengfu District guerrillas repeatedly destroyed the Chiang Kai-shek bandit highway, cutting off enemy reinforcements, and destroyed the puppet second security unit Baojia organization, killing and capturing more than 30 enemies before and after, and capturing alive Li Fanghua, the major intelligence team leader of the Chiang Kai-shek First Division. The Zichang guerrillas, known for their bravery and resourcefulness, annihilated and captured more than 40 enemy soldiers below the company commander level in September. On the southern front, the Chunhua and Yao County local armed militia in the Guanzhong sub-district, in cooperation with the Yao County guerrilla detachment, attacked an enemy stronghold north of Xiaoqiu (40 li west of Yao County) on the evening of the 11th of last month, annihilating all of Zhang Yanning's bandit troops and the eighth company of the Seventh Regiment of Shaanxi Security, killing 27 people including Zhang Yanning and the company commander Ma Huali, and capturing 42 of them, seizing three machine guns and 55 long and short guns. The local armed guerrillas in Ansai, Dingbian, Yanchi and other places are also extremely active.
