Desertion has become a common practice among soldiers, especially new recruits. When stationed in one place, they are often confined to houses, surrounded by sentries. On trains, officers and their "lackeys" guard the doors, watching them like they are trying to protect a counterfeit currency note. Even when they need to go to the toilet, they are tied with ropes and escorted by guards with guns... However, no matter how strict the defense, it is impossible to stop the mass desertions. This is the biggest headache for the officers!

Those who are caught after deserting are, of course, either put in solitary confinement, beaten to death, or buried alive... It is a way for the officers to vent their anger, but most of them, once they run away, never come back. Therefore, the officers have come up with many ways to "vent their anger." For example, the method of "Ma" Company Commander of our transport company is: catch a new recruit, give each of them three blows with a stick, and then assign them to a squad. He often says triumphantly:

"Even if you run away, I have already given you three blows with the stick, so I haven't lost anything."

    蒋匪军妙闻
    梅村记
    士兵开小差，成了风气，特别是新兵。住在一个地方，经常要关在房子里，周围放上哨，坐在火车上，官长和他们的“狗腿”，要把伪宪子守住门，大小便要用绳子拴住，派枪押着……但是，不管你防守的怎样严，总止不住成群成批的逃亡。这是官长们最感头疼的！
    开小差捉回来，当然或关禁闭，或打死，活埋……是可出官长的一口气了，但是，大部分，既然跑了，总是回不来的。于是，官长们就想了好多“出气”的办法。如我们输送连“麻”连长的办法是：抓到新兵，每人先打三棍，然后编到班里。他常得意地说：
    “即使你跑了，我的三棍已经打过，还不算吃亏。”
