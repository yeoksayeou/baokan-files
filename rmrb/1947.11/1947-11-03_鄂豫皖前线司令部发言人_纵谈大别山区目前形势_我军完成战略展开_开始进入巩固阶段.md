Xinhua News Agency, Hubei-Henan-Anhui Front, 1st: The spokesperson of the Front Command, on the 29th, discussed the situation in the Dabie Mountains over the past two months since the People's Liberation Army arrived, telling reporters, "It has been exactly two full months since our army completely crossed the Huai River on August 29th and entered the Hubei-Henan-Anhui region of the Dabie Mountains. In these two months, we have not only gained a firm foothold, but have also entered a stage of in-depth penetration and gradual consolidation." The spokesperson then recalled the experience of the southward counter-offensive army, considering it a memorable historical feat. "Under the wise strategic guidance of Chairman Mao, after annihilating nine and a half brigades of the Chiang bandits in southwestern Shandong, we smoothly advanced from the Yellow River to the Yangtze River. This signifies the People's Liberation Army's leap forward of a thousand miles, which is a great victory for the Chinese people. At the beginning of our southward advance, the Chiang bandit headquarters estimated that this was a forced action of our army 'being unable to cross the Yellow River to the north and fleeing south,' so they only used a dozen or so brigades to escort us south. Chiang bandit was so short-sighted and ignorant, but greatly helped us to complete the task of strategic leap. It was not until our army crossed the Yellow River flood area, the Sha River, the Ying River, the Hong River, and the Ru River that Chiang bandit suddenly realized, but it was too late. When our army crossed the Huai River, in less than twenty days, with the force of sweeping away fallen leaves with an autumn gale, we captured most of the county towns in southeastern Henan, eastern Hubei, and western Anhui, and directly approached the Yangtze River coast, completing the strategic deployment. At this time, Chiang bandit turned from stupidity to panic, realizing that the large armies of Generals Liu and Deng had gained a firm foothold in the Dabie Mountains. Immediately following, our Chen-Xie army launched a counter-offensive in Henan and Shaanxi, and the Chen-Su army crossed the Longhai Railway to the south, teaching Chiang bandit to be even smarter, and further realizing that the strategic pincers of the three powerful counter-offensive armies of the People's Liberation Army had formed." At this point, the spokesperson said in a cheerful tone: "Indeed, we have gained a firm foothold in the Dabie Mountains. In the past two months, we have done a lot of things. First of all, we have carried out victorious battles, annihilating one division headquarters, three complete brigades, and three complete regiments of Chiang bandit regular troops, together with battalions and below, totaling more than 30,000 enemies annihilated. Secondly, we have successively occupied twenty-three county towns, eliminating many Chiang bandit local troops. The struggle for these county towns has changed hands once, sometimes twice, or even four times. To this day, we still hold ten county towns, including Jingfu, Lihuang, Qianshan, Taihu, Yuexi, Wangjiang, Susong, Huangmei, Guangji, and Xishui, as well as the vast countryside of other counties. We have established thirty-three patriotic democratic county governments and military region commissioner's offices and other levels of military and political institutions. And what is especially important is that wherever our army goes, it cherishes the people, helps the peasants to distribute grain and property, and the broad masses of the people universally demand the distribution of land and the abolition of debts, and demand to be armed to defend their gains. Now land has begun to be distributed in some places. In the initial stage, in order to implement the policy of not conscripting laborers, the wounded soldiers in battle were entirely carried by ourselves, and many brigade and regimental commanders and political commissars personally carried them. But before long, in the Anhui western battle of annihilating the 62nd Brigade on October 8th, and this battle of annihilating the 40th Division and the 82nd Brigade, the masses automatically participated in the war, transporting the wounded soldiers. This unity between the army and the people is an invincible force. It should be especially pointed out that the Hubei-Henan-Anhui masses, rich in twenty years of revolutionary tradition, and the comrades who have consistently persisted in the Dabie Mountains guerrilla warfare for the past two years, are an important force that has enabled our large army to quickly gain a foothold and quickly unite with the people." The spokesperson then spoke about the current military situation in the entire region, saying: "After our army entered the Dabie Mountains, there were a total of twenty-three brigades of Chiang bandit troops in the entire region. Later, due to the counter-offensive of our Chen-Su and Chen-Xie armies, four brigades were withdrawn, but two brigades of the 88th Division and two brigades of the Youth Army were transferred in, still totaling twenty-three brigades. Now more than four brigades have been annihilated by us, and the remaining strength is no more than nineteen brigades. Most of them have suffered heavy losses, low morale, and great losses in personnel. It is really too difficult to use such a weak force to defend the Yangtze River and the Pinghan Line, and to protect strategic locations such as Anqing, Hefei, Jiujiang, and Hankou. The embarrassing situation of Chiang's army running around and being stretched thin is everywhere. And our two major victories in western Anhui and eastern Hubei are just the beginning of a large-scale annihilation of the enemy." Finally, the spokesperson said: "When our army first arrived, we naturally encountered many difficulties, such as northern comrades not being accustomed to eating rice, walking mountain roads, walking small roads, wearing straw sandals, and lacking stretchers for transportation. However, with its inherent perseverance, our army has gradually overcome these difficulties after two months of training and relying on the assistance of the people. The facts of the past two months fully prove that it is entirely possible for the People's Liberation Army to go deep into the Chiang-controlled areas to carry out operations without rear support and achieve victory, as long as we have the firm will to defeat the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, the determination to annihilate the enemy in large numbers, and adhere to the policy of mobilizing the masses. This is a valuable experience and foundation for our People's Liberation Army to continue to go deep into the heart of the Chiang bandit rule south of the Yangtze River."

    鄂豫皖前线司令部发言人
    纵谈大别山区目前形势
    我军完成战略展开
    开始进入巩固阶段
    【新华社鄂豫皖前线一日电】前线司令部发言人于二十九日就人民解放军到达大别山后两个月来的形势对记者发表谈话称：“我军自八月二十九日全部南渡淮河，进入大别山鄂豫皖区域以后，今天刚刚两个整月了。在这两个整月中，我们不仅站稳了脚跟，而且已经进到开始深入和逐渐巩固的阶段了。”接着发言人回忆南下反攻大军的经历，认为这是可纪念的历史壮举。“我们这次在毛主席英明的战略方针指导之下，在鲁西南歼灭了蒋贼九个半旅之后，即顺利的从黄河进到长江，这表示人民解放军跃进了一千里，这是中国人民的伟大胜利。蒋贼统帅部在我们南进之初，曾估计这是我军“不能北渡黄河而南窜”之被迫行动，所以只把十几个旅的兵力用送行的方式尾我南下。蒋贼如此短视与无知，却大大地帮助了我们完成战略跃进的任务。直到我军经越黄泛区、沙河、颖河、洪河而渡过汝河时，蒋贼才恍然大悟，可是悔已晚矣。及到我军渡过淮河，不到二十天的时间，以秋风扫落叶的气势，攻占了豫东南、鄂东、皖西大部县城，直迫长江沿岸，完成了战略展开。这时蒋贼才由愚蠢变成慌乱，认识到刘邓两将军的大军已经在大别山区站稳脚跟了。紧接着我陈谢大军反攻豫陕，陈粟大军南越陇海，教训得蒋贼更加聪明起来，更进一步感到人民解放军三支强大反攻大军的战略犄角之势已形成了。”至此发言人以愉快的口吻说：“的确，我们在大别山站稳了脚跟。两个月来，我们做了很多事情。首先我们进行了胜利的战斗，消灭了蒋匪正规部队一个师部，三个整旅，三个整团，连同营以下在内，共计歼敌三万余人。其次，是我们先后占领了二十三座县城，消灭了不少蒋匪地方部队。这些县城之争夺，有的一次易手，有的两次乃至四次易手，至今尚有：经扶，立煌、潜山、太湖、岳西、望江、宿松、黄梅、广济、浠水等十座县城，及其他各县的广大乡村在我手中。我们已建立三十三个爱国民主县政府，及军区专署等各级军事政治机构。而尤其重要的是：我军每到一处，爱护民众，帮助农民分粮分财，广大民众普遍要求分田废债，要求武装起来保卫自己的翻身果实。现在已在某些地方开始进行了分田，在初期我们为了执行不拉夫政策，打仗的伤兵完全由自己抬，许多旅、团长和政治委员都亲自抬。但是为时不久，十月八日的皖西歼灭六十二旅战役，和这次歼敌四十师和八十二旅的战役，群众就自动参战，转运伤兵。这种军民一致的结合，就是不可战胜的力量。尤应特别指出的是：富有二十年革命传统的鄂豫皖群众，和两年来始终坚持大别山游击战争的同志们是使我大军能够迅速立定脚跟，并很快与人民结合的重要力量”。发言人继就目前全区军事形势谈称：“我军进入大别山后，全区蒋匪共有二十三个旅，后因我陈粟和陈谢两军反攻，抽走了四个旅，但又调来八十八师两个旅，青年军两个旅，仍为二十三个旅。现已被我歼灭四个多旅，剩余兵力不过十九个旅。其中大部受创很重，士气低落，减员甚大。要以这样弱小的兵力，既要防守长江和平汉线，又要保护安庆、合肥、九江、汉口等战略要地，实在太困难了。蒋军东奔西调，捉襟见肘的窘态，随处可见。而我在皖西鄂东两次大捷，只不过是大量歼灭敌人的开始。”最后发言人说：“我军初来时，自然也还遭受到许多困难，如北方同志不习惯吃大米，走山路，走小路，穿草鞋，缺乏担架运输等。然而我军以其素具坚忍不拔的毅力，经过两个月来的锻炼，和依靠人民的协助，这些困难已经逐渐克服了。两个月来的事实完全证明：人民解放军深入蒋管区进行无后方的作战到取得胜利，是完全可能的。只要我们具有打倒卖国贼蒋介石的坚强斗志，大量歼敌的决心，和坚持发动群众的方针。这是我人民解放军继续深入长江以南蒋匪统治的心脏的宝贵经验和基础。”
