Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 9th. Our reporter Liu Boyu reports: The "Comprehensive Model Company" of a certain unit of the Democratic Allied Forces carried out speak-bitterness education. At the beginning, everyone was unwilling to speak, feeling embarrassed. Some soldiers even said, "A real man sheds blood, not tears," and "What's the use of speaking bitterness?" Later, after brewing in squads and platoons, everyone spoke their bitterness, and the masses' thinking gradually deepened. A real typical example was discovered. Li Yuhai, a 19-year-old soldier from the third platoon, spoke bitterness at the military meeting. When he was five years old, his father was so poor that he almost threw him into the Songhua River. He herded sheep for landlords since he was a child and suffered all kinds of humiliation. At seventeen, he was conscripted into the Chiang army and became a semi-disabled person. He stood under the portrait of Chairman Mao and cried out every word with tears. The atmosphere in the meeting place was extremely solemn, and sobbing was heard from every corner. One person finished speaking, and another rushed to speak. Finally, the machine gun squad hugged each other and cried bitterly, and the whole audience cried so much that the meeting could not continue. After that, the question was raised: "Why do we have to suffer so much?" and the meeting moved into the stage of "digging up the roots of bitterness." At this time, the leadership completely adopted the method of everyone discussing and everyone debating. In a few days, the whole company was filled with debates day and night. In summary, there were the following understandings: blaming fate, blaming themselves for not working hard enough, blaming Manchukuo, blaming social inequality, blaming the big-bellied landlords, and so on. When the debate blamed fate, it naturally split into two factions: those from Dongkeng blamed fate, while those from Xikeng did not blame fate. In the end, people from Dongkeng all ran to Xikeng. In digging up the roots of bitterness, everyone eventually dug up Chiang Kai-shek. At this point, the soldiers' emotions were filled with deep hatred for the enemy. After recognizing the truth, the soldier An Zhenshan confessed at the meeting that he had been a bandit in the old society. He said, "I can't face my own suffering if I don't speak out." So the movement turned to excavating what they had done that was sorry for their own suffering, and what kind of thoughts they had that were sorry for the poor. Finally, the soldiers expressed how to take revenge well. One after another, they walked to the glorious "Comprehensive Model Company" banner and swore: love the poor and avenge the poor. The soldier Hu Mingqing even wrote his oath on red paper and pasted it on the butt of his gun. Lu Xiqin, the heroic company instructor who won a medal in the Battle of Siping, also said to the soldiers under the banner: "Ninety percent of our company have suffered the same hardships. From now on, regardless of cadres or soldiers, everyone is a class brother. In the future: first, we will do everything possible to make everyone suffer less during marching; second, we will be with everyone in life and death on the battlefield; third, we will never lose our temper in peacetime management." After this class education and ideological education, in the preliminary actions of the autumn offensive, the whole company marched urgently day and night, and no one fell behind. Many soldiers also put forward the request: to be a glorious Communist Party member and resolutely make revolution for the poor to the end.

　　民主联军某部“全面模范连”
    掀起诉苦复仇教育
  　战士阶级觉悟提高
    【新华社东北九日电】本社记者刘伯羽报导：民主联军某部“全面模范连”的诉苦教育，连队在开始时，大家不肯说，觉得难为情，有些战士并说：“大丈夫流血不流泪”，“诉苦有啥用”等，后来经过班排酝酿，一个个诉苦，群众思想逐渐深入，发现了真正的典型，三排十九岁的战士李玉海在军人大会上诉苦，他五岁时父亲穷得没办法，几乎把他丢进松花江，从小给地主放羊，备受凌辱，十七岁被蒋军抓丁当兵，弄成个半残废，他站在毛主席像下一字一泪的哭诉，会场空气极为严肃，不时从各个角落里传出啜泣之声。会上一个诉完一个抢上去诉，最后机枪班抱头痛哭，全场大哭，哭得会议无法进行。此后即提出：“为什么我们要受这么多的苦？转入‘挖苦根’阶段，这时领导上完全采取大家讨论、大家争辩的办法，在几天里，全连日夜充满着争辩，归纳起来，有以下几种认识：怨命苦，怨自己没有好好干，怨满洲国，怨社会不平等，怨大肚子地主等等。当争论怨命时，很自然的分成两派，东坑的怨命，西坑的不怨命，争到后来，东坑的人都跑到西坑里去了。在挖苦根中，最后都挖到蒋介石头上，至此战士们情绪充满对敌人的深仇巨恨。战士安振山认清真理后，在会上坦白了自己在旧社会曾经当过土匪，他说：‘不说出来，对不起自己的苦。’于是运动转而掘发出自己作过那些对不起自己苦的事，还有些什么对不起穷人的思想，最后战士纷纷表示怎样报仇报得好。他们一个跟着一个的走到光荣的“全面模范连”大旗下宣誓：爱护穷人，为穷人报仇。战士胡明清并把自己誓词写在红纸上，贴在自己的枪托上。四平之战受奖章的英雄连指导员卢锡勤，也在大旗下对战士们说：“我们全连有百分之九十都是同样遭受过苦难的人，今后不分干部战士，大家都是阶级兄弟，以后：第一、在行军中想一切办法让大家少吃苦；第二、在战场上生死和大家在一块；第三、平时管理上决不发脾气。该连经这一阶级教育与思想教育后，秋季攻势的初步行动中，日夜急行军，全连没有一个人掉队落伍；并有许多战士提出要求：愿作一个光荣的共产党员，坚决为穷人革命到底。
