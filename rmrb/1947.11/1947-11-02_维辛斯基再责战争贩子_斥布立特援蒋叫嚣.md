Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, October 31st: New York dispatch: The Political and Security Committee of the United Nations General Assembly has been debating the issue of war criminals since the 22nd. Vyshinsky spoke several times at the meeting, and in his long speech on the 22nd, he once again called for an end to the propaganda of new wars. Vyshinsky first pointed out that reactionaries are using two methods to oppose the Soviet proposal to stop war propaganda. On the one hand, they try to conceal the threat of a new war as much as possible, and on the other hand, they blame the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, playing the trick of "the thief crying 'stop thief!'" He then listed the crimes of several warmongers, including U.S. Secretary of Commerce Harriman, Secretary of Defense Forrestal, former Secretary of State Byrnes, Bullitt, Hamilton Fish, British Member of Parliament Osborne, and Conservative leader Churchill. Vyshinsky stated that Harriman encouraged the U.S. government to use a powerful air force to deal with the ambition of the Eastern "aggressor" he invented and cultivated a more "adventurous spirit" in American newspapers. Bullitt, on the other hand, continued his warmongering sermons in "Life" magazine, urging the U.S. government to oppose the Chinese workers and peasants and vehemently demanding that the U.S. intensify its interference in China's internal affairs and transport more American weapons and military equipment to Chiang Kai-shek in China. Bullitt estimated that all of this would cost the United States no more than $1.5 billion, but America's "independence" would be saved as a result. It seemed that America's "independence" depended solely on China's (Chiang's government) "independence." Bullitt predicted: "Unless this is done, America's 'independence' will not last longer than China's 'independence,' not even for a generation." At the same time, Bullitt did not relax in following the fable of the Russian writer Krylov: I will also kick him to let him taste the donkey's hoof. That is to say, use his foot to kick the Soviet Union. But what Bullitt is pursuing is not China's independence, but only a new excuse to wantonly slander the Soviet Union and incite aggressive war. Byrnes' book "Speaking Frankly" encourages the U.S. government to use the United Nations to make the Soviet Union "submit" and withdraw its occupying forces from the eastern regions of Germany, and openly threatens the Soviet Union with war. This attitude is characteristic of a certain class in the United States today. Vyshinsky then refuted the U.S. representative Austin, the British representative McNair, and other reactionary representatives for opposing the Soviet proposal under various pretexts such as "freedom of the press"; and loudly called on all member states of the United Nations to support the just proposal to stop the propaganda of new wars.

    维辛斯基再责战争贩子
    斥布立特援蒋叫嚣
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】纽约讯：自廿二日起联大政治安全小组委员会开始讨论战贩问题，迄廿六日止，仍在激辩中。会上维辛斯基曾数度发言，在其二十二日之长篇演说中，再次呼吁制止新战争的宣传，维氏首先指出：反动派用两种手法来反对苏联所提制止战争宣传的建议案。一方面尽量掩蔽新战争的威胁，一方面嫁罪苏联及东欧各国，玩弄“贼喊捉贼”的伎俩。继又列举几个战争贩子的罪行，其中包括美商务部长哈立曼、国防部长福勒斯特尔、前国务卿贝纳斯、布立特、哈密尔敦费希、英国议员奥斯朋及保守党头子邱吉尔之流等等。维氏称：哈立曼鼓励美国政府以强大的空军对付他所发明的东方“侵略者”的野心：并培植美国报纸更加“冒险的精神”。布立特则在“生活”杂志上，继续其好战的说教，要美国政府反对中国工农，并狂烈地要求加紧干涉中国内政及为蒋介石运送更多的美国武器及各种军事设备到中国去。布立特估计这一切使美国破费的不会超过十五亿万元，但美国的“独立”将因而得救。似乎美国的“独立”惟中国（蒋政府）之“独立”是赖。布立特预言：“除非这样做，否则美国的‘独立’将不比中国的‘独立’维持的更久，甚至于一代。”同时布立特并不放松遵照俄作家克利洛夫的寓言：我亦来踢他一脚，让他尝尝驴蹄的味道。就是说用他的脚来踢苏联一脚。但布立特所追求的并不是中国的独立，只是恣意诽谤苏联与鼓动侵略战的新借口而已。贝纳斯所著的“实言”一书，鼓动美国政府利用联合国，使苏联“就范”而撤退德国东部地区的占领军，并公开以战争来恫吓苏联。这种态度正是现在美国某一阶层的特征。维氏继驳斥美代表奥斯汀、英代表麦克纳尔及其他反动代表用“新闻自由”等各色各样的借口来反对苏联提案；大声疾呼要求联合国各会员国支持制止新战争宣传的正义建议。
