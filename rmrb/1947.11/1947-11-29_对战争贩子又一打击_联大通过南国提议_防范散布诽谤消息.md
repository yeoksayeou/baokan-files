Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th: Chenggong Lake News: At the plenary session of the UN General Assembly on the 15th, a resolution was passed to prevent the dissemination of defamatory information that damages friendly relations between countries; this is another blow to the war profiteers who are accustomed to spreading rumors and slander. This case was proposed by Yugoslavia and had been intensely debated in the Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee beforehand. At that time, the Yugoslav representative sharply criticized the rumors and slanders spread by reactionary American and British newspapers against the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe. The Indian representative also strongly condemned "the American newspaper trust's endangerment of the freedom of the press for most small countries in the world." The Soviet representative cited facts to prove how American monopoly capital monopolizes the American newspaper industry: three American news agencies (Associated Press, United Press, and International News Service) monopolistically supply news to 1,300 of the 1,744 American daily newspapers, while the remaining newspapers are controlled by two other news agencies. Under the weight of solid evidence, the American representatives and others were forced to admit that countless capitalist publications were spreading rumors and hindering normal relations between countries.

During the discussion of the issue of economic assistance after the end of the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the United States, by manipulating the "majority" vote, rejected Yugoslavia's proposal to reaffirm the General Assembly's resolution last year that economic assistance should not be used as a political weapon. This once again exposed the United States' ambition to continue using so-called "economic assistance" as a tool for political expansion.

　　对战争贩子又一打击
  　联大通过南国提议
    防范散布诽谤消息
    【新华社陕北廿四日电】成功湖讯：联大十五日全体会议上，通过了防范散布损害各国友好关系的诽谤消息的决议；这对于惯于散布谣言诬蔑诽谤的战争贩子，是又一个打击。此案由南斯拉夫提出，事前曾经社会人权文化委会激烈讨论。当时，南代表曾尖锐批评美英反动报纸对东欧新民主国家所散布的谣言与诬蔑。印代表也力斥“美报纸托辣斯危及全世界大多数小国的新闻自由”。苏代表则列举事实，证明美独占资本如何垄断美报业：三家美国通讯社（美联社、合众社与国际新闻处）在一七四四家美国日报中，垄断地供给着一千三百家日报的消息，而其余的报纸却为另外两家通讯社所支配。在确凿的证据下，美代表等被迫不得不承认有无数资本家的印刷品，散布谣言，妨害各国的正常关系。
    大会在讨论联总结束后的经济援助问题时，由于美国操纵“多数”票，拒绝了南国重申大会去年关于经济援助不得利用为政治武器的建议，这再次暴露了美国要继续以所谓“经济援助”作为政治扩张工具的野心。
