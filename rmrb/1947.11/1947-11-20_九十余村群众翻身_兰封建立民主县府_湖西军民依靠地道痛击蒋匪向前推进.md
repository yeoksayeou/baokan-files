　　More Than Ninety Villages Overturn
　　Lanfeng Establishes Democratic County Government
　　Lake West Military and Civilians Rely on Tunnels to Painfully Strike Chiang Kai-shek Bandits and Advance Forward
　　[Report from this newspaper, JiluYu, 18th] After the liberation of more than ninety villages in the new border area of Lan (feng) and Kao (cheng), the masses launched a struggle to overturn. Our Fifth Military Sub-district local regiment and the Kaocheng County Detachment launched several consecutive attacks in the Lan-Kao border area, scattering and eliminating the puppet Kaocheng Third District and small groups of bandits led by Liu Enchang and others. More than ninety villages were liberated, and in early November, the Lanfeng County Government and two district administrations were established. At this time, the cadres of Kaocheng County, who had advanced into the newly liberated area, actively cooperated with the troops, publicized policies such as land reform and burden allocation, refuted enemy rumors head-on, and selectively distributed floating wealth in thirty-two villages. More than 4,200 people participated, distributing a total of 140,000 catties of miscellaneous grains, wheat, and cotton, 250 pieces of clothing and furniture, six bundles, and 165,000 catties of firewood and grass. Currently, the masses in the area are enthusiastically carrying out the struggle to overturn.
　　[Report from this newspaper] Comprehensive report: Over the past year, nearly one million soldiers and civilians in the Lake West (west of Dushan Lake and Weishan Lake) area of JiluYu have persisted in guerrilla warfare amidst extremely tense anti-"encirclement and suppression" and anti-"sweeping." They have continuously restored and built base areas, and are now relying on a spiderweb-like network of dense tunnels to advance step by step towards the areas occupied by Chiang Kai-shek. Before July, the area regularly contained an enemy reorganized division and seven security regiments. Over the past year, after three major tug-of-wars, they have shattered Chiang Kai-shek's many brutal "encirclement and suppression" and "sweeping" operations. There are many heroic and moving deeds: for example, from June 8th to 24th, the Hua Dang (new county, between Dangshan and Yucheng) County armed forces relied on tunnels to fight against more than 3,000 enemies for seventeen days and nights. On the 13th, our seventeen people held a tunnel, repelled an attack by a Chiang Kai-shek battalion, killing and wounding twenty-two of them, with no casualties on our side. On the 14th, our twenty-eight people confronted more than 300 men from the 58th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's regular army in Huangcaiyuan for four hours, killing and wounding nineteen of them, with no casualties on our side. In July, the enemy used a paratrooper column combined with local teams, totaling more than 6,000 people, to invade with fierce momentum, but repeatedly ran into obstacles in front of the tunnels and was soon crushed. According to statistics from the county for two months ending at the end of October: we only suffered one minor injury, but killed, wounded, and captured more than a hundred Chiang Kai-shek bandits. During this period, the military sub-district and the local armed forces of each county have developed rapidly. Certain two regiments have expanded two to three times. In addition, new regiments and two county detachments have been established, and Chiang Kai-shek's American weapons are constantly being seized, making their equipment increasingly perfect, and artillery is also starting to be created. The pessimism and disappointment of some cadres and masses in the early stages of the war have long passed. They have all been tempered to be very strong in the arduous struggle, and fearless models like Li Rutai have emerged. The tunnel warfare started with cadres persisting alone, and then developed into a mass struggle. Three fifteen- and sixteen-year-old children from Li Hai in Hua Dang County used a gun to hold a bunker and killed two enemies. Chiang Kai-shek bandits are extremely afraid of the tunnels. Even the main force, when seeing the tunnels, had to detour. The enemy's Fifth Reorganized Division fled through the area from southwestern Shandong and suffered from ambushes and harassment everywhere. Now the tunnels in the area are extending outwards to more closely surround Chiang Kai-shek's nests.

　　九十余村群众翻身
  　兰封建立民主县府
    湖西军民依靠地道痛击蒋匪向前推进
    【本报冀鲁豫十八日电】兰（封）考（城）边界新区九十余村解放后，群众掀起翻身斗争。我五分区地方兵团和考城县大队，连续数次出击兰考边界地区，打窜和消灭伪考城三区及匪杂刘恩长等小股后，九十余村获得解放，当于月初建立了兰封县政府和两个区政权。这时我考城县挺进到新解放区的干部，积极配合部队工作，宣传了土改、负担等政策，针锋相对的揭破了敌人谣言，有重点的在三十二个村庄分浮财，共有四千二百多群众参加，共分得杂粮、麦子、棉花等十四万斤，衣服和家具二百五十件，包袱六个，柴、草十六万五千斤。现在该区群众正在热烈进行翻身斗争。
    【本报讯】综合报导：冀鲁豫湖西（独山湖、微山湖以西）地区近百万军民一年来在极紧张的反“清剿”、反“扫荡”中坚持游击战争，不断恢复与建设根据地。现更依靠蛛网般稠密的地道，向蒋占区步步推进。该区在七月以前，经常牵制敌一个整编师及七个保安团队。一年以来，经过三次大拉锯，粉碎了蒋匪多次残酷的“清剿”与“扫荡”，可歌可泣的英勇事迹极多：如六月八日至二十四日，华砀（新县，在砀山、虞城间）县武装，依靠地道与敌三千余人对打十七昼夜。十三日，我十七人坚守一地道，击退蒋匪一个营的进攻，毙伤其二十二名，我无伤亡。十四日，我二十八人在黄菜园与敌正规军五十八师三百余人对峙四小时，毙伤其十九名，我亦无伤亡。七月敌以伞兵纵队配合地方团队共六千余人来犯，声势凶猛，然在地道面前再三碰壁，不久即被粉碎。据该县至十月底止两个月的统计：我仅轻伤一名，却毙伤俘蒋匪达百余人。在此期间，分区及各县地方武装均猛烈发展，某某两兵团已扩大了两倍至三倍，此外，又建立了新的兵团和两个县大队，并不断夺获蒋美武器，使自己装备日臻完善，炮兵亦开始在创建中。战争初期某些干部、群众的悲观失望早已过去，都在艰苦斗争中锻炼得十分坚强，并出现了李汝泰式的无畏的典型。地道战由干部单独坚持开始，进而发展为群众性的斗争，华砀县李海三个十五、六岁的小孩即用一支枪坚守住了一个地堡，并打死二个敌人。蒋匪对地道极为恐惧，即使是主力，见了地道，也只好绕道而过。敌整五师自鲁西南窜路经该区，到处受阻击袭扰，吃尽了苦头。现该区地道正在向外伸展，以便更紧密地包围蒋匪的巢穴。
