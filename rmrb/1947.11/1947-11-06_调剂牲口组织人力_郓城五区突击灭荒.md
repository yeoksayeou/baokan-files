[Our Dispatch from the Border Region of Hebei, Shandong and Henan on the 4th] The masses in the Fifth District of Yuncheng are currently mobilizing livestock and organizing manpower to eliminate wasteland with a spirit of fierce attack, expanding wheat planting. The villages with the most wasteland in the district include Wangying Village, with 270 mu of wasteland, Dingzhuang with about 200 mu, and Liangdian with over 100 mu. There are three reasons for the occurrence of this wasteland: First, the land of military dependents, revolutionary martyrs, and militia cadres who have left home to fight as guerrillas is often left uncultivated because they are constantly in a state of guerrilla warfare, and there is no labor force in the family. The masses are too busy taking care of their own land to harvest and plant this land. Currently, most of this wasteland has been rushed into planting. The method is to first organize the manpower and livestock within the village, and then mobilize assistance from nearby villages that planted wheat earlier and in greater quantities. Second, the land of fleeing landlords, although nominally distributed, the masses dare not plant it, fearing revenge from the Chiang Kai-shek troops. For example, the landlord Wang Qingde in Wangying Village had a son who was a regimental commander in the Chiang Kai-shek army, and Wang Naiyou was the head of the "Homecoming Corps." Although the masses hated him intensely, they were still afraid of him. Only after thorough mobilization did the masses have a correct understanding of the situation, recognizing that the Chiang Kai-shek troops were bound to be defeated and that neither the Chiang family officials nor the "Homecoming Corps" were anything to fear. At the same time, the difficulties of planting wheat were resolved for the masses, and only then did they begin to plow and plant. Third, in the struggle against the masses, most of the landlords' land has been seized, but it has not been well distributed in the enemy's several seesaw battles, resulting in wasteland. This wasteland has now been rapidly distributed. If not yet distributed, the village will organize manpower and livestock to plant it first, and then distribute it when there is time. In addition to the above three types of wasteland, the leadership has also discovered some phenomena of excessive land retention, which is due to the fact that poor peasants have no livestock or wheat seeds. Now, by adopting methods such as mutual assistance in manpower and livestock, and unified allocation of wheat seeds within the village, these excessively retained lands have also been planted with wheat. Therefore, the wasteland throughout the Fifth District is considered to be adequately resolved. Furthermore, since the recovery of Yuncheng and Linpu, the masses urgently need to plant wheat, but they are all troubled by the lack of wheat seeds. Before the Chiang Kai-shek troops occupied the area, the landlord Zhang Zhiming had not delivered 1,800 jin of wheat that he should have given to the masses. This time, the masses demanded this wheat back, and all 163 poor peasant households in the village had wheat seeds to plant!

    调剂牲口组织人力
    郓城五区突击灭荒
    【本报冀鲁豫四日电】郓城五区群众现正调剂牲口及组织人力，以突击精神消灭荒地，扩大种麦。该区荒地最多的村子，如王营村，荒地二百七十亩，丁庄约二百亩，梁店一百多亩。发生这些荒地的原因有三：一、是军工烈属和离家打游击的民兵村干等土地，因经常处于游击状态，家中无劳动力，群众自己的地还顾不上收种，这些地也就荒起来了。现此种荒地，大部已抢种完毕，办法是首先组织本村人畜力，另外再从附近村种麦较早较多的村庄，去动员帮助，二、是逃亡地主的地，虽然名义上已经分了，可是群众不敢种，害怕蒋军再来报复，如王营村地主王庆德，他儿在蒋军当团长，王乃友当“还乡团”的乡长，群众虽万分恨他，可是还怕他，后经过深入的动员，群众对形势有了正确的认识，认定蒋军必败，蒋家官和“还乡团”都没什么可怕的，同时又给群众解决了种麦困难，才开始犁种；三、是在群众斗争中，已斗出地主大部土地，但在敌人几次拉锯中，都未能很好分配下去，因而荒芜。对这些荒地，现已迅速分了下去，未分的先由村中组织人力畜力种上，以后有时间再分。除以上三种荒地外，领导上又发现了一些多留春地的现象，即由于贫农没牲口，没麦种，而发生者。现在由于采取人畜力靠互助，麦种由村内统一调剂等办法，多留的这些春地，也一并种上了麦子。因此，全五区的荒地都算得到适当解决。又自郓城、临濮集收复后，群众亟需种麦，但都为没麦种作难，在蒋军占领该地以前，地主张治明应交给群众的麦子一千八百斤一斤未交，这次群众便将此麦索出，全村一百六十三户贫农，都有了麦种耩地啦。
