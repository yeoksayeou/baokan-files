　　After the Military Service Campaign in Sunjiazhuang, Gaoyi
    Expand the Militia and Replenish Armaments
    [Report from our newspaper in Gaoyi] In this military service campaign, the young militiamen and village cadres of Sunjiazhuang, Gaoyi, mostly joined the counter-offensive army, and the militia needs to be expanded again. At the meeting to expand the militia, the masses said in unison: "The youth go to the front to fight Chiang Kai-shek, and we in the rear must join the militia." Zhu Shedou, the deputy public security officer, shaved his beard in order to join the militia, and said, "Although I am over forty years old, my body is still strong. I will definitely carry a gun and join the militia to protect the interests of the masses." Sixty-nine men signed up on the spot. Hao Laiyun (family member of a soldier) said, "Men go to the front to fight Chiang Kai-shek, and we women cannot go to the front to fight. We must also join the militia in the rear." Twenty young women rushed to sign up at that time. The next day, a meeting of activists among hired peasants and poor peasants was held. After everyone recognized that the militia was their own armed force, they examined the applicants one by one. Among them, Yan Dasan, everyone said that he was a bankrupt landlord who had exploited the poor and was not qualified to be a militiaman; Guo Laowan was a rich peasant, and the masses did not allow him to participate either; Zhao Erhai had joined the Kuomintang and had colluded with secret agents. He had confessed to the masses, but his thinking had not been thoroughly transformed, so he could not join either. On the third day, a mass meeting was held for re-examination, and the masses put forward the conditions for joining the militia: First, a good history; second, good class background; and third, good ideological consciousness. Based on these conditions, after detailed examination, two rich peasants, two bankrupt landlords, five people with bad thoughts, and four old and weak people were eliminated. Finally, twenty-seven militiamen, twenty-two self-defense team members, and twenty women were selected to form a women's guard team. The newly expanded militia are in high spirits, patrolling every night and practicing martial arts every morning. (Qiao Lin, Wen Yan, Yong Huai, Xi Xian)

　　高邑孙家庄参军运动后
    扩大民兵充实武装
    【本报高邑讯】在这次参军运动中，高邑孙家庄的青年民兵与村干部，大部参加了反攻军，民兵需要再扩大。在扩大民兵的会议上，群众都异口同声的说：“青年上前线打老蒋，我们在后方要参加民兵。”副公安员朱射斗，为了参加民兵，把胡子剃了，他说：“我虽然四十多岁，身体还壮，一定背起枪杆参加民兵，保护群众利益。”当场即有男子六十九人报名。妇女郝来云（抗属）说：“男子上前线打老蒋，我们妇女不能到前方打仗，在后方也要参加民兵。”当时即有二十个青年妇女抢着报名。第二天又召开了雇佃贫积极分子会议，大家认识了民兵是自己的武装后，把报名的一个一个审查，其中阎大三，大家说他是个破落地主，剥削过穷人，没有当民兵的资格；郭老万是个富农，群众也不准他参加；赵二海参加过国民党，与特务有过勾结，向群众坦白过，但思想上没有彻底转变，也不能加入。第三天又召开群众大会复查，群众并提出参加民兵的条件：一是历史好，二是成份好，三是思想意识好，根据条件，经过详细审查，清除富农二人，破落地主二人，思想不良的五人，老弱的四人，最后选出民兵二十七名，武装自卫队二十二名，妇女二十名，组织妇卫队。新扩大的民兵，情绪很高，每夜出外游动，每早下操练武。（乔林、文彦、永怀、希贤）
