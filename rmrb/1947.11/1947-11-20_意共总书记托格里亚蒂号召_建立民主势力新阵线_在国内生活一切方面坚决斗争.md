Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. TASS, Rome, 15th: Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti, at a meeting of the party's Central Committee, reported on the international and domestic political situation, pointing out that Italy must establish a broad new front of democratic forces, and that the Christian Democratic Party (the current ruling party) has become the main enemy of democratic forces. In analyzing the current situation in Italy, Togliatti emphasized that the current situation is very different from the situation on the eve of the party's last congress a year ago in many respects. Since then, the domestic political and class struggle has greatly intensified. The recent assassination of trade union organizers in Sicily and the attack on workers in the suburbs of Milan are not isolated facts, but part of a large-scale offensive by the darkest reactionary forces in the country. The seriousness of the domestic situation is closely related to the serious struggle between imperialism and democratic forces on the international stage. Togliatti strongly stated that the policies of the Christian Democratic Party and its activities in the government constitute a betrayal of democracy. What the party is currently doing has become the main enemy of democratic forces. The leaders of many "center-left" parties are undergoing a crisis because they cannot adequately counter the ideological onslaught of reactionary and imperialist forces. Togliatti proposed that the main goal of future struggle, as before, is to achieve progressive democracy. He said: We must obtain fundamental economic and social reforms. We must not only wage a resolute struggle in the political field, but also in all aspects of domestic life. This great struggle of the Italian people to establish progressive democracy and save the three greatest demands of the Italian people (freedom, labor, and national independence) will lead to a decisive victory. This requires the establishment of a broad new front of democratic forces. These democratic forces must win the victory in the economic struggle against the go-slow tactics of the monopoly groups and against the government's economic policies. In the political field, we must actively and bravely defend the democratic order and democratize all government institutions. In terms of foreign policy, in order to enable the Italian people to occupy a place in the camp fighting for peace, resolute action must be taken. We must stop being slaves to Britain and the United States. Togliatti concluded by stating that in this new situation and new prospect, we must consider the entire issue of alliances between the various political and social groups facing the task of establishing a broad front of democratic forces.

　　意共总书记托格里亚蒂号召
    建立民主势力新阵线
    在国内生活一切方面坚决斗争
    【新华社陕北十六日电】塔斯社罗马十五日讯：意共总书记托格里亚蒂在该党中央委员会会议上，报告国际国内政治形势，指出意大利必须建立民主势力广大的新阵线，基督教民主党（按系现政府执政党）已成为民主力量的主要敌人。托氏在分析意大利目前形势时强调指出：目前在许多方面都与一年前该党上次大会前夕的形势极不相同。从那时以后，国内的政治与阶级斗争，已大大地紧张起来。最近西西里工会组织者之被杀害，与米兰市郊工人运动的工人们之遭受攻击，并非孤立的事实，而是国内最黑暗的反动势力的大规模攻势的一部分。国内形势的严重，是与国际舞台上帝国主义与民主力量间的严重斗争密切相关的。托氏力称：基督教民主党的政策及其在政府中的活动，形成了对民主的背叛。该党目前的所作所为，已成为民主力量的主要敌人。所谓“中间偏左”的许多党派的领导人物，正经受着危机，因为他们不能适当地反击反动派与帝国主义势力的意识形态上的猛攻。托氏提出今后奋斗的主要目标和以前一样，即实现进步的民主主义。他说：我们必须获得经济与社会的基本改革。必须不仅在政治方面作坚决斗争，并且要在国内生活的一切方面作坚决斗争。这一意大利人民大众为建立进步的民主主义和挽救意人民的三个最大要求（自由、劳动与国家独立）而进行的伟大斗争，将走向决定性的胜利。这必须建立民主势力广大的新阵线。这些民主势力必须赢得反对垄断集团怠工与反对政府经济政策的经济斗争的胜利。在政治方面，必须主动的勇敢保卫民主秩序，并使政府机构均实行民主化。在外交政策方面，为了使意国人民在为和平而斗争的阵营中占有地位，必须坚决的行动。必须停止作英美的奴仆。托氏结论力称：在这新形势与新前途下，必须考虑面临着成立民主势力广大阵线的任务的各政治与社会集团间联盟的整个问题。
