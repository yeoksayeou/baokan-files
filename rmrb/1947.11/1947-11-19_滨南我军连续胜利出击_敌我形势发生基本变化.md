Xinhua News Agency, East China, 17th. The Binan Front Headquarters recently commented that the victorious attacks of our Binan army marked a fundamental change in the situation of the struggle between the enemy and us in Binan. In the past forty days, the local armed forces at all levels in Binan have launched continuous offensives in the areas surrounding Xinhai along the eastern section of the Longhai Railway and in the Yihe and Shuhe plains on the outskirts of Linyi, annihilating more than 3,500 enemy troops, recovering more than 20 important strongholds, and more than 500 villages. Currently, in a vast area of more than 200 miles stretching south to the Longhai Railway, west to the Yi River, and east to the East China Sea, there are no traces of the enemy except for the isolated strongholds around Xinhai, Tancheng, Matou, and the outskirts of Linyi. Our army also controls more than 100 miles of the Longhai Railway from Caobu to Ahu, and at the same time cuts off the enemy's Hai-Zheng Highway, enabling the Binan military and civilians to directly connect with the anti-Japanese military and civilians behind enemy lines in northern Jiangsu to cooperate in combat. One of the characteristics of the offensive is that the main force corps and the local armed militias of various counties have achieved organic coordination and unified operations in tactics; the second characteristic is that our army moves quickly and unexpectedly, and when we inserted ourselves into the heart of the Chiang bandits on the east bank of the Yi River, the enemy still thought it was their own troops; the third characteristic is that after the land reform education, our army's soldiers have raised their class consciousness and are full of morale; the fourth characteristic is that once a village is liberated, a struggle to divide land and wealth is launched immediately, and under the demand to protect the fruits of victory, a joint defense and self-defense system is immediately established to encircle the enemy's isolated strongholds.

　　滨南我军连续胜利出击
  　敌我形势发生基本变化
    【新华社华东十七日电】滨（海）南前线指挥部顷评述滨海我军胜利出击为划分滨南敌我斗争形势基本变化阶段。四十天来，滨南各级地方武装在陇海东段沿线新海外围与临沂外围沂河、沭河大平原展开连续性攻势，歼敌三千五百余人，克复重要据点二十余处，村庄五百余，现南至陇海路、西至沂河、东至东海，纵横二百余里广大地区，除新海、郯城、马头、临沂外围各孤立据点外，已无敌踪。我军并控制陇海路曹埠至阿湖段百余里，同时切断了敌海郑公路，使滨南军民与苏北敌后军民取得直接连系，以配合作战。攻势特点之一，为主力兵团与各县地方武装民兵在战术上已取得有机配合，统一作战；特点之二，为我军动作迅速，出敌意外，当我插进蒋匪心脏沂河东岸时，敌犹以为是其自己部队；特点之三，为我军战士经土地改革教育后，阶级觉悟提高，士气旺盛；特点之四，为一经解放之村庄，即掀起分地、分浮财斗争，并在保护果实要求下，立即成立联防自卫、围困敌之孤立据点。
