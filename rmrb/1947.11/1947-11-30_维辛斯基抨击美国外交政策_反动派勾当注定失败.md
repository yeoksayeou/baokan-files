Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 26th: TASS, New York, November 19th: At a banquet held by the American-Soviet Friendship Association to celebrate the October Revolution Day, Vyshinsky delivered a moving speech on US-Soviet relations. The conclusion of the speech forcefully stated: "No matter how hard the reactionaries try, their collusion will never succeed, their fate has been historically determined. May they be carted to the garbage heap of history, and the sooner the better." At the beginning of the speech, Vyshinsky vividly depicted the history of the birth, development, and strengthening of the Soviet Union. He recalled how the reactionary forces initially did not recognize the legitimacy of the Soviet Union's creation; later, they hoped that this child would die quickly, and the sooner the better. But this child gradually grew up, became healthier, had rosy cheeks, and gradually began to show its strength. So the reactionary forces organized a league of fourteen countries for armed intervention. The current Dulles and Churchill were active members of it. Vyshinsky said humorously and solemnly: "I should be completely frank and very sorry to say that American troops were also among these interventionists, they went to Vladivostok and Murmansk. Needless to say, they were not there to dance the foxtrot. We remember this very clearly, and all our friends remember this just as clearly. I think they, like us, will not allow American soldiers to set foot on our territory again. Naturally, I also make this wish for the British interventionist forces; but I will not do so now, but wait until I get to London to say it. But I should point this out, especially because De Gaulle is calling for the organization of a new Anglo-American-French crusade, and France also believes that she can be useful in the anti-Soviet crusade." At this point, Vyshinsky described how the Soviet Union's enemies at that time exerted pressure on the Soviet Union and implemented a hard-line policy. Although Soviet Russia was in chaos at that time, the Tsarist troops of Denikin, Kolchak, Wrangel, etc., with the support of capitalists, nobles, and foreign interventionists, were attacking Soviet Russia from within. But despite the fact that their conditions were much more favorable than they are now, they finally suffered a shameful defeat. This was the result of the hard-line policy adopted by many countries, including the United States during the Hoover presidency, towards the Soviet Union. Vyshinsky also pointed out that the American reactionaries also opposed the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Soviet Union in 1933. Even now, the reactionaries represented by Hearst and his ilk are still trying to undermine this diplomatic relationship. "We understand that the purpose of American policy is to undermine cooperation between the Soviet Union and other new democracies and the United States and the Western countries that follow the United States. For example: Dulles' recent statement on behalf of the US government at the United Nations General Assembly." At the General Assembly, Dulles acted as if he were the master, saying: "The system of the Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam conferences will be gone forever." Vyshinsky commented: "Dulles' statement is a denial of cooperation. This statement is an attempt to repeat the path the world took before the Second World War, which resulted in the Second World War." World wars are caused by aggressive countries preparing for war, and Hitler was encouraged by the Munich appeasers. Regarding the destruction of Hitler's lair, the American reactionaries believe that it was a mistake. This can be evidenced by the foreign policy of the United States, the purpose of which is to restore Germany's heavy industry. Vyshinsky condemned the United States and Britain for now doing things that undermine the Potsdam Agreement and maintain and strengthen the remnants of fascism. He said: "Violating the Potsdam decision, not liquidating cartels and trusts, but restoring and strengthening them, is done in order to use Germany to realize a definite plan, so that it can be used to advance eastward again when necessary in the future." Vyshinsky declared that what the Soviet Union hopes for is cooperation based on democratic principles, mutual respect, and consideration of mutual interests, and opposes cooperation between horses and riders. We are unwilling to be horses for others to ride, nor do we want to be riders riding others. Finally, Vyshinsky pointed out that the new war instigators are preparing for war not only in weapons but also in thought, and the propaganda of the American reactionaries is forcing public opinion to turn against the Soviet Union. Therefore, Vyshinsky believes that the current efforts of the American and British people for peace and for strengthening friendship with the Soviet Union are of great political significance because the result of this work will create a vanguard of loyal and truth-loving people.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 22nd: TASS, New York, November 19th: British Labor Party left-wing member of parliament, Zilliacus, delivered a speech at the banquet held by the American-Soviet Friendship Association to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution and the 14th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, saying: During my stay in the United States, I witnessed a growing fear of the threat of war. He forcefully stated: The British people, the American people, and the Soviet people all want peace. Zilliacus criticized the "hard-line policy" towards the Soviet Union advocated by Churchill and followed by Truman and the British Labor government, saying: This "hard-line policy" violates the principles of the United Nations organization. Zilliacus continued: Churchill cannot speak for the British people, and cannot unilaterally assume unworkable obligations on behalf of the British people, that is, when the United States risks launching an anti-Soviet war with its "hard-line policy," Britain is an ally of the United States. He said that British workers will never be cannon fodder for the conservatives. Under no circumstances are they willing to fight against workers in the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. Zilliacus commented on the Marshall Plan: This plan "caused tension in Europe."

### 维辛斯基抨击美国外交政策　反动派勾当注定失败

　　维辛斯基抨击美国外交政策
  　反动派勾当注定失败
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】据塔斯社纽约十九日讯：在美苏友谊协会庆祝十月革命节的宴会上，维辛斯基曾发表动人演说，畅谈美苏关系。演说的结语力称：“不论反动派如何努力，他们的勾当将永不能获胜，他们的命运已经被历史注定了。但愿他们被马车运到历史的垃圾堆去，并且愈快愈好。”演说开始时，维辛斯基生动地描绘了苏联的诞生发展与壮大的历史。他回忆反动势力起初如何不承认苏联的产生是合法的；过后又希望这个孩子会很快死掉，并且愈快愈好。但是这个孩子逐渐长大，逐渐健康，有着玫瑰色的双颊，而且逐渐开始表现他的强大了。于是反动势力就组织了十四国武装干涉的联盟。现在的杜勒斯、邱吉尔，都是其中的积极分子。维辛斯基幽默而严正地说：“应该完全坦白又非常抱歉地说：美国军队也在这些干涉者中，他们曾经到了海参威和摩尔曼斯克。不用说，他们在那里并不是为了跳狐步舞。我们很清楚地记住这点，我们所有的朋友都同样清楚地记住了这一点。我想他们象我们一样，将不允许美国兵再踏到我国领土上。自然，我对英国干涉军也作这种愿望；但我现在并不这样做，等我到伦敦时再说。但我应当提出这点，特别因为戴高乐在号召组织英美法的新十字军，法国也相信她自己在反苏十字军中也能够有用处了。”至此，维辛斯基叙述苏联的敌人当时如何对苏联施行压力，实行强硬政策。虽然那时候苏俄正处于混乱中，邓尼金、高尔察克、乌兰格尔等沙皇军队，在资本家贵族与外国干涉者支援下，正由内部攻打苏俄。可是尽管当时他们的条件比现在要有利得多，他们终于遭受到可耻的失败。这就是当时许多国家，包括胡佛总统时代的美国在内，对苏实行强硬政策的结果。维辛斯基又指出，一九三三年美苏之恢复邦交，美国反动派也是反对的。即在现在，以赫斯特之流为代表的反动派，仍图破坏这个外交关系。“我们了解美国政策之目的，在于破坏苏联及其他新民主主义国家和美国及追随着美国的西方各国之间的合作。例如：最近杜勒斯代表美政府在联合国大会上的声明。”杜勒斯在大会上俨然以主子口气说：“德黑兰、雅尔塔、波茨坦会议的制度，将一去不复返了。”维辛斯基评论说：“杜勒斯的声明就是否认合作。这个声明就是企图重蹈第二次世界大战以前世界所走的道路，其结果就造成了第二次世界大战。”而世界大战是由于侵略国家进行战争准备而产生的，希特勒是受了慕尼黑分子的鼓励的。关于摧毁希特勒这个野兽巢穴，美国反动派认为是做错了。这可以用美国的外交政策作证，这政策的目的，即在恢复德国的重工业。维辛斯基斥责美英现在所做的是破坏波茨坦协议，保持和加强法西斯主义残余。他说：“违反波茨坦决定，不去清算卡特尔、托辣斯，反面恢复和加强它们，这样做是为了利用德国实现一种确定的计划，以便在将来有必要时再用它东进。”维辛斯基宣布，苏联所希望的是以民主原则互相尊重，以及照顾相互利益为基础的合作，而反对马和骑马者间的合作。不愿意做马让别人骑，也不愿做骑马者骑别人。最后，维辛斯基指出，新的战争挑拨者不仅在武器上，而且正在思想上作战争准备，美国反动派的宣传正在迫使舆论转向反苏。因此，维辛斯基认为目下美英人民为和平与为加强对苏友谊的努力，具有非常重大的政治意义，因为这个工作结果会造成忠诚和爱好真理的人民先遣队。
    【新华社陕北廿二日电】据塔斯社纽约十九日讯：英工党左翼议议员齐里亚库斯，在美苏友好协会庆贺苏联十月革命卅周年及美苏建立外交关系十四周年的宴席上发表演说称：我在美国逗留时期，目睹一种对战争威胁之恐惧心在增长。他力称：英国人民美国人民与苏联人民一样都希望和平。齐氏斥责邱吉尔所提倡而为杜鲁门及英工党政府所奉行的对苏“强硬政策”说：这种“强硬政策”违反联合国组织的原则。齐氏继称：邱吉尔不能代表英国人民说话，并且不能代表英国人民擅自担负行不通的义务，即当美国以其“强硬政策”冒险发动反苏战争时，英国为美国的盟国。他说，英国工人决不会作保守分子的炮灰。在任何情况下他们不愿与苏联及东欧各国工人作战。齐氏对马歇尔计划评称：这个计划“引起欧洲的紧张局势”。
