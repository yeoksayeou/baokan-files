　　Family Members Visit Camp and Praise it Highly
  　A Unit in Xiu and Huoguo Sets Up a Family Guest House
    [Reported by this newspaper] Recently, a unit in Xiu and Huoguo added more than one hundred new soldiers who are undergoing short-term mutual assistance study with veteran soldiers in a certain area of Qinghua. Most of the new soldiers are local, and their families came to visit them one after another. In order to facilitate the reception, it was decided to establish a family guest house for each battalion. The family members were very moved by our warm reception. Some family members originally wanted to ask their children or husbands for leave to go home and see them, but they didn't mention it. The family member of the new soldier Zhang Facai told the instructor: "They are much better off than at home. They wear new cotton clothes and new military caps, and their appearance has changed. They really look like foreign students." An old lady ×嘱咐 (zhǔfù- urged) her child, saying, "Don't think wildly, listen to the orders of your superiors and learn skills. I am relieved!" The sincere reception of the family guest house moved the new soldiers, and they all expressed their determination to study with peace of mind and to serve the people wholeheartedly.
