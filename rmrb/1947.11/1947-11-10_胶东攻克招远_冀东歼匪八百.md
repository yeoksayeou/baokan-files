    Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 8th. The People's Liberation Army recovered Zhaoyuan County on the 3rd. The Chiang Kai-shek army's Independent Brigade of the 8th Reorganized Division (Note: This brigade was reorganized from local troops), which had entrenched itself in the city, fled to the Huangshanguan area along the northwest coast. Zhaoyuan was invaded on September 21st.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jidong, 8th. In the past half month, the Jidong Local Corps has launched attacks everywhere, from the Bohai Sea in the east to the Baihe River in the west, from the outskirts of Tianjin in the south to Chengde in the north. They captured an enemy patrol boat of the Tanggu Prefectural Commissioner's Guard Brigade in the Bohai Sea off Leting, and an enemy steamer at Langwokou, Donghai, Changli, seizing more than one hundred taels of gold. They also swept away Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gangs in the strip of land between the Grand Canal and the Fengh River, opening up a new situation on both sides of the North Canal and further threatening the Xiaoni Highway, the second transportation line of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Pingjin. The military and civilians of Tongxian County thoroughly smashed the "five-all policy" of "eating all, destroying all, burning all, driving all, and looting all" implemented by the Chiang Kai-shek puppets since September. The militia of Shunyi County on the east bank of the Baihe River successfully defended the autumn harvest and autumn plowing with landmines and indigenous guns and cannons, and the Chiang Kai-shek puppets' attempt to seize grain completely failed. The northern local armed forces defeated more than 1,000 local landlord gangs from Pingquan who attempted to invade Kuancheng on the 17th, and recovered Yingshouguanzi, the coal mining center on the outskirts of Chengde, on the 21st. In total, 786 enemies were annihilated in half a month, two ships, five artillery pieces, 32 light and heavy machine guns, and 338 long and short guns were captured, and important towns such as Daxinzhuang (southeast of Tangshan), Yingshouying, and Changtun were recovered.
