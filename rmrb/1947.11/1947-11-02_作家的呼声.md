    The Writer's Call
    Ehrenburg
    We are the defenders of culture against greedy barbarians who seek to destroy Europe.
    Turkey was once called the "sick man of Europe," dependent on London, Paris, and Vienna for survival. Now, the bourgeois "sick man of Europe" is in a critical state. They can survive temporarily because their American nephew is giving them a shot in the arm. This nephew, with money, will soon become the uncle. What the bourgeoisie cannot abandon is barbarism. Before the war, the bourgeoisie destroyed tens of thousands of tons of materials, dumping them into the sea as garbage, and burning millions of bushels of grain as fertilizer.
    Our policy is to be selfless protectors of culture. For the bourgeoisie, culture is their coffin, while for us, culture is the source of spiritual life. We not only have a progressive cultural life, but also continue to advance culture. Whether in science or art, we are ahead of America. In the cause of the new society, we are ahead of all people. Precisely because of this, America's precious and best books, films, and paintings are created by people who oppose the bourgeoisie. Precisely because of this, various vivid artistic works and people-attentive popular scholars, writers, and artists of various countries are standing on our side.
    Who is opposing us? A group of insatiable barbarians who are trying to plunder property and destroy the Western Hemisphere. Let the people of European countries know who is threatening their homes, their children, and their parents. Let all Americans know what dark deeds the warmongers are calling on them to do. In our country, no one wants war, and everyone opposes war. These words are not for Harriman, who understands this very well. These words are for those who have not yet understood Harriman's tricks.
    The Call for Peace is the Soviet Oath
    Our republic is approaching its thirtieth anniversary. At its inception, it launched the call for world peace, which has become its oath. For thirty years, our republic has consistently and thoroughly defended the cause of peace, calling on all countries to disarm. Our newspapers have never published calls for attacks on other countries at any time. However, when Hitler's Germany invaded us, we maintained the honor of the peaceful Russian people and were able to force seasoned warlords to surrender and achieve final victory. We uphold peace and are working to maintain it. Our representatives in various international organizations are not only defending the children of Moscow and Belgrade, but also the old and young of New York and Massachusetts. They are defending mothers all over the world. They are defending Europe, defending the beautiful houses of Paris and San Francisco.
    I think it would be best for Mr. Harriman to recall the scenes he saw in Moscow in the past. After delivering a challenging speech, he should reflect on history. What did Mr. Harriman think when he saw the endless columns of German prisoners in the Soviet Union? Does he have a conscience?
    The Cause of Peace is in the Hands of the People - The Day of Triumph Will Come!
    A year ago, I saw a bridge between two cities broken in Paris. At that time, I asked, why not build a new bridge? A pessimist replied, "What's the point? War will break out again soon." Not long ago, I made a long journey of five thousand kilometers within our country. The people are busy with construction work. They are building bridges, schools, and cities. Perhaps some pessimists will accuse us of being overly optimistic. But we are not ostrich "optimists" who bury their heads in the sand and see nothing. Mussolini-style optimism is like that. It is the optimism five minutes before the shelling begins. We not only see the threat, see the profiteers who are getting rich, who are getting very high dividends, even though these dividends will stain the city with blood. But we also see conscientious people in the United States, and we see many hungry and cold European people, but I also see strong warriors defending peace. They all oppose warmongering. Naturally, we also have sharp eyes. We know that the cause of peace is firmly in the hands of the people, our reason and culture will surely triumph, and we believe that the day of triumph will surely come. (To be continued)

    作家的呼声
    爱伦堡
    我们是文化的保卫者贪婪的蛮子企图毁灭欧洲
    从前有人曾把土耳其称为“欧洲病夫”，依靠伦敦、巴黎、维也纳而生存，现时资产阶级的欧洲病夫，他的病态已非常危急，他暂时能活下去，是由于美国侄子替他们打强心针。这个侄子有钱，马上即变成伯父了。资产阶级不能离开的东西，就是野蛮行动。资产阶级在战前，曾毁灭了成万吨的物资，把它们当垃圾沉于海底。把千万石粮食当肥料焚烧。
    我们的政策是大公无私的文化保护者。对于资产阶级，文化就是他们的棺材，而对我们，文化是精神生活的来源。我们不仅已有了进步的文化生活，而且还使文化继续向前推进。无论科学艺术，我们都跑在美国前头，在新社会事业中，我们已跑在一切人们的前头。正因为如此，美国宝贵的最好的书籍、影片、油画都是与资产阶级对立的人所创造的，正因为如此，各种生动艺术作品与各国人民所注意的民众学者、作家、艺术家，都是站在我们这一方面。
    谁在反对我们呢？反对我们的一群贪婪不足的蛮子，他们正在企图掠夺财物，毁灭西半球。让欧洲各国人民知道，究竟谁在威胁他们的家乡、他们的儿女、他们的父母。让所有美国人知道、好战分子究竟叫他们干的是那些黑暗的勾当。在我们祖国无论谁都不愿意战争，无论那个人都反对战争，这些话并不是对哈立曼说的，他自己很明白这点，这话应该对那些还没有懂得哈立曼诡计的人们说的。
    和平的号召是苏联誓言
    我们共和国从成立已快满三十年，在他产生的时候。就发起世界和平的号召，这个号召已变成了他的誓言。我们共和国在三十年来，一贯彻底的保卫和平事业，号召各国解除武装。我们的报纸，无论在什么时候，都没有发表号召进攻其他国家的呼声。但是希特勒德国侵略我们的时候，我们曾保持了俄国和平人民的荣誉，能够迫使老练的军阀投降，而获得最后的胜利。我们拥护和平，而且正在努力维护和平。我们的代表在各种国际组织中不仅在保卫莫斯科和布尔格莱德的儿童，而且也还在保卫纽约和马撒加的老少，他们是在保卫全世界的母亲，是在保卫欧洲，保卫巴黎、旧金山的美好的房屋。
    我以为最好由哈立曼先生回想一下他从前在莫斯科看到的情景，当发表挑战演说之后，应把历史思索一下，哈立曼先生在苏联当看到源源不绝的德国俘虏纵队时有何感想？不知有良心否？
    和平事业掌握在人民手里  凯旋的日子会到来的！
    一年以前，我在巴黎看到两城市之间桥断了，当时我问，为什么不建设一座新桥？一个悲观主义者回答说：“要他干什么？很快又要打起仗来。”不久以前，在我国境内我作了五千公里的长途旅行，人民都忙于建设工作，他们在建设桥梁、进学校、和城市。可能某些悲观主义者会责备我们抱过分乐观思想。可是我们并不是驼鸟的“乐观主义”，把自己的头埋在沙漠里，看不见任何东西。莫索里尼派乐观主义就是如此。这是开炮前五分钟的乐观主义。我们不仅看到威胁、看到发财致富的投机商人，他们自己得到了很高的红利，虽然这红利会用血染红城市。但是我们也看到在美国国内有良心人士，也看到许多饥寒交迫的欧洲人民，但我也看到了保卫和平的强大战士。他们都反对干战争挑拨勾当。自然我们也有锐利的眼光，我们知道和平事业坚固的掌握在人民的手里，我们的理智和文化必获胜利，我们认为凯旋的日子定会到来。（续完）
