Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 15th -- Frontline reporter Wu Chengyu reports: During the Qingfengdian annihilation battle, a certain unit of the Jin-Cha-Ji People's Liberation Army conducted battlefield technical reviews, and many models of battlefield troop-loving emerged. At the beginning of the battle, the 3rd Battalion of a certain unit convened cadres above the platoon level to study the issue of battlefield troop-loving and seized the time to educate the troops with "casualty reviews" during combat deployment, implementing "reviewing while fighting." On the 20th of last month, during the battle of Gaojiazuo, as the 10th Company was blocking the enemy from HeCun Village to the southwest, the company political instructor, He Tan, traveled back and forth on the front, constantly urging and inspecting the company's fortifications, and implementing reviews. During the battle, taking advantage of the intervals between enemy attacks, he conducted "reviewing while fighting" on the front lines. Zhang Decai, the 4th squad leader of the 11th Company, when approaching the enemy and passing through an open area, ordered the entire squad to disperse, designated the movement directions of each combat team, and the movement paths for the soldiers. After attacking the village, upon occupying a position, he immediately ordered the entire squad to rush to build fortifications, and selected better fortifications as examples, calling on everyone to learn from them. When soldier Cao Shuntian's fortifications were small and shallow, the squad leader taught him how to dig after seeing them, and helped him shovel dirt, saying, "If you don't put in effort when building fortifications, you'll suffer in combat, don't deceive yourself." Under his leadership, the squad suffered no casualties. When Zhang Yuhou, the machine gun squad leader of the 3rd Platoon, led his squad to hide after passing through an open area, he immediately conducted on-the-spot education, introducing the quick and low movements of soldier Peng Yongzhong when passing through the open area. After attacking into the village, they built fortifications along the base of the wall. When enemy artillery shells fell near Peng's fortifications, less than ten meters away, Peng was not killed or injured because he was concealed within his fortifications. The squad leader used this as an example to educate everyone on the methods of building machine gun positions and personally helped the soldiers dig fortifications. When continuing to advance, the squad leader first checked the terrain, selected a good route of movement, and then led the entire squad forward, telling everyone to hide well upon arrival, and not to move without orders, and took the opportunity to explain the properties of bullets and artillery shells and how to avoid them. When the enemy's firepower was sparse, he led the soldiers to observe the enemy's movements in order to train the soldiers' abilities. Therefore, the squad suffered no casualties in the battle.

　　晋察冀某部两个班
    进行战地技术讲评
  　在战斗中无一伤亡
    【新华社晋察冀十五日电】前线记者吴程予报导：清风店歼灭战中，晋察冀人民解放军某部进行战地技术讲评，涌现很多战场爱兵模范。某部三营在战役进行之初，即召集班以上干部研究战场爱兵问题，并在布置战斗中抓紧时间以“评伤亡”教育部队，实行“边打边评”。上月廿日高家左战斗时，该部十连于阻击西南合村出援之敌前，该连政指何谭往来于阵地左右，不断督促检查全连工事，实行讲评。战斗中又乘敌人攻击之间隙，在火线上进行“边打边评”。该部十一连第四班长张德才在接敌运动通过一开阔地时，令全班疏开队形，指定各战斗小组运动方位，与战士运动道路。攻进村后，占领一点，即令全班抢筑工事，并选择较好工事作榜样，号召大家学习。战士曹顺田的工事又小又浅，班长看后，教他如何挖，帮他铲土。并说：“作工事不卖力气，战斗时就吃亏，不要自己骗自己”。该班在他领导下无一伤亡。三排机枪班长张玉厚率全班战士于通过开阔地后隐蔽停下时，即进行实地教育，介绍了战士彭永仲在通过开阔地时之又快又低动作。在攻入村内即沿墙根筑工事，构筑时敌炮弹恰落于彭之工事附近，相隔不到十米，因彭隐蔽工事内，未被杀伤，班长即以此为例，教育大家筑机枪阵地的方法，并亲自帮助战士挖工事。继续前进时，班长先看好地形，选好运动道路后，再领全班前进，到时叫大家隐蔽好，无命令不准乱动，并趁机讲述子弹、炮弹之性能及防避要领，乘敌人火力稀疏时，率战士观察敌人动作，以锻炼战士能力。因此，该班在战斗中均无伤亡。
