Xinhua News Agency, East China, 28th. A reporter from the Central China Branch commented on the new situation after Central China shifted to a strategic counter-offensive: Since the Ye Ting (Yancheng) Campaign began in August, and the Liu-Deng and Chen-Su large armies successively went south, Central China has entered a new stage of strategic counter-offensive. In the past three months, over 29,000 enemies have been killed, wounded, or captured, 169 towns and strongholds have been recovered, and over 10,000 square *li* of lost territory has been restored. Currently, we control over 300 *li* of the Tongyu Highway, a major artery in central and northern Jiangsu, from Funing to Dongtai. Except for Funing city, there are no enemy traces within the over 50,000 square *li* east of the Dongtai-Ye Ting-Funing line and part of the area between Funing and Lianshui. In the 17,000 square *li* of Tong, Ru, Hai, and Qi in central Jiangsu, which the enemy had "bloody washed and purged," we control about eight-tenths of the area. In the four counties south of the Hai'an-Taixian line—Rugao, Taixing, Taixian, and Jingjiang—three-quarters of the lost territory has been recovered. In the Huainan and Huaibei liberated areas, in addition to the Chen-Su army liberating Lingbi and Sixian, two cities in the Seventh Military Subdistrict, most of the area east of Hongze Lake and west of the Grand Canal, as well as the Xufengjia triangle area, has also been liberated. We also control many important towns on the highway from Huaiyin to Mingguang Station on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, such as Gaoliangjian and Jiangba. The lost territory east of the Yanhai River and north of Suqian and Shuyang in Guanyun County, south of the Longhai Railway, is also gradually being recovered. Longquangou, only 15 *li* from Xin'anzhen Station, is also under our control.

The reporter continued to elaborate on the factors for Central China's entry into the counter-offensive, stating: After Central China fully entered the Chiang-controlled area last winter, it was surrounded on three sides, facing the Yellow Sea to the east. In August of this year, the nationwide counter-offensive began, changing this basic situation. The people's armed forces in Central China, who had independently persisted behind enemy lines, were transformed into a flank on the southern line of the battlefield north of the Yangtze River, becoming a component of the Liu-Deng and Chen-Su counter-offensive armies. This change in the national war situation prompted Central China's counter-offensive to begin a step earlier. However, the internal condition that determined Central China's entry into the counter-offensive was the unprecedented growth of the people's power in Central China. First, due to the resolute implementation of the policy of boldly mobilizing the masses, the land reform in Central China has been universally deepened in the central areas, the marginal areas, and the "purged" areas. For example, in the extremely tense Ninth Military Subdistrict, half of the 395 villages in the entire area have undergone reinvestigation. In the newly recovered area of Taixing, more than 100,000 farmers have gained fruits in the anti-liquidation movement. The universal deepening of land reform has led to tens of thousands of emancipated farmers constantly joining the People's Liberation Army. The high political consciousness of the broad masses of emancipated farmers, fighting for patriotism, self-defense, and land protection, has become the decisive force for successfully persisting behind enemy lines and transitioning to a counter-offensive. Secondly, the People's Liberation Army and local armed forces at all levels have greatly developed and improved, achieving a relative advantage. The local armed forces of the Ninth Military Subdistrict have grown fourfold in the past year. The county and district armed forces of Zishi (newly established county) have grown fivefold in five and a half months. Since the counter-offensive in August, the Taixing local armed forces have doubled in strength. And they have universally acquired excellent weapons and equipment from the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. The seizures of a certain company in Jingjiang are enough to equip four companies. The East District team of Haimen, which had only one locally made machine gun in March, now has more than ten American-made machine guns captured from the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. What is particularly important is the great improvement in tactics and combat effectiveness. The North Jiangsu People's Liberation Army showed its strength for the first time in January, annihilating 70 enemies, and in the Ye Ting Campaign in August, it annihilated more than 5,000 enemies. And the combat effectiveness of the local armed forces has also developed to a high degree. Thirdly, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops have suffered heavy losses and have been forced to turn to strategic defense. Since the counter-offensive in August, 29,000 Chiang Kai-shek bandits have been annihilated. The current Chiang Kai-shek bandit forces in Central China, including regular troops and local troops, total approximately 44 regiments, most of which have been replenished after being annihilated, and their combat effectiveness is extremely low. Apart from being used to defend transportation lines and some towns, they have only five regiments of mobile troops, most of which are remnants newly replenished after being annihilated. Another weakness of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits is that the local Chiang forces have been severely weakened, and most have been subdued. In the Ye Ting Campaign, more than 2,000 Chiang Kai-shek "Homecoming Legions" from the nearby four counties were all annihilated. Although the Chiang Kai-shek bandits reoccupied Ye Ting City, they were finally forced to retreat.

The reporter concluded by pointing out the future development trend of the situation in Central China: The victorious unfolding of the counter-offensive in Central China will effectively cooperate with the various armies on the western front. However, it cannot be ignored that the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Central China still have a certain defensive force in important towns, strongholds, and transportation lines, and they will inevitably carry out desperate counter-attacks in local areas. But the overall trend is set, and the Central China People's Liberation Army will advance bravely in accordance with certain steps.

　　华中我军转入战略反攻
    后蒋匪被歼已达三万
    我军取得相对优势蒋匪已成残破不全
    【新华社华东廿八日电】华中分社记者评述华中转入战略反攻后之新形势称：自八月叶挺（盐城）战役开始，刘邓、陈粟大军相继南下以后，华中即转入战略反攻新阶段。综计三个月来，毙伤俘敌二万九千余，收复城镇据点一百六十九处，恢复失地一万余方里。目前我控制苏中、苏北大动脉通榆公路阜（宁）东（台）段三百余里，（东）台北、叶挺、阜宁一线以东及阜宁涟水间一部五万余方里内，除阜宁城外，已无敌踪。经敌“血洗清剿”过的苏中通、如、海、启全境一万七千余方里中，我控制地区约占十分之八。海（安）泰（县）线以南如皋、泰兴、泰县、靖江四县，恢复失地四分之三。淮南、淮北解放区除陈粟大军解放七分区灵璧、泗县二城外，洪泽湖以东运河以西地区及盱凤嘉三角地区，亦大部解放，并控制淮阴通达津浦线明光车站之公路上高良涧，蒋坝等重要市镇多处。陇海路南灌云县境盐河以东及宿（迁）沭（阳）以北失地，亦渐告恢复。距新安镇车站仅十五里之龙泉沟，亦在我控制中。
    记者继阐述华中转入反攻之因素称：华中解放区去冬全面进入蒋后，东临黄海，三面受围，今年八月，全国性反攻开始，即改变了这一基本形势，独立坚持蒋后之华中人民武装，一变而为长江北岸南线战场的一个翼侧，成为刘邓、陈粟两路反攻大军的一个组成部分。这一全国战局的变化，促使华中反攻提早了一步。但决定华中进入反攻的内部条件，乃是华中人民力量的空前壮大。首先，由于坚决执行了放手发动群众的方针，华中土地改革普遍深入到中心区，边缘区以及被“清剿”区，如情况极度紧张的九分区，全境三百九十五个乡中，亦已有半数乡经过复查，泰兴新恢复区，就有十余万农民在反倒算运动中分得果实。土改的普遍深入，使成千成万的翻身农民不断涌入解放军，广大翻身农民为爱国自卫保田而战的高度政治觉悟，就成为胜利坚持蒋后并转入反攻的决定力量。其二是解放军与各级地武已大大发展与提高，取得了相对的优势。九分区地武一年来壮大四倍，紫石（新设县）县区武装五个半月中壮大五倍，泰兴地武在八月反攻以来，即壮大一倍。并普遍从蒋匪方面取得了优良的武器装备。靖江某连的缴获足可装备四个连，三月间仅有一挺土造机枪的海（门）东区队，现在有了缴自蒋匪的十余挺美造机枪。特别重要的，是战术与战斗力的大大提高。苏北解放军一月间初试锋芒，歼敌七十，至八月叶挺战役，即歼敌五千余。而地武之战斗力，也已高度发展。其三是蒋匪兵员经大量折损，已被迫转入战略防御。八月反攻以来，蒋匪已被歼二万九千人，现蒋匪在华中兵力正规军与地方部队合计约有四十四个团，大部分系被歼后重新补充者，战斗力极低，除用于防守交通线及一些城镇外，仅有五个团的机动兵力，大部分是被歼后新补充之残部。蒋匪另一弱点，是土蒋已遭到严重削弱，多数已被制伏。叶挺战役中，附近四县蒋记“还乡团”二千余全部就歼后，蒋匪虽重占叶挺城，而终于被迫撤退。
    记者最后指出今后华中形势发展趋向称：华中反攻的胜利开展，将有力地配合西线各路大军，但不可忽视华中蒋匪在重要城镇据点与交通线上尚有一定的防御力量，必然要在局部地区进行挣扎性的反扑，但总的趋向已定，华中人民解放军将按着一定步骤英勇进军。
