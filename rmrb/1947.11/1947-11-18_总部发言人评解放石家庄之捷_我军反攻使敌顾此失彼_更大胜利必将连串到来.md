　　Headquarters Spokesperson Comments on the Victory of Liberating Shijiazhuang
  　Our Army's Counteroffensive Causes the Enemy to Be Overwhelmed
    Greater Victories Will Come in Succession
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th] The spokesperson of the People's Liberation Army Headquarters commented on the victory of liberating Shijiazhuang, pointing out: This is an important victory and the beginning of a series of major victories to come. The spokesperson pointed out: After the Northeast Democratic Allied Army launched its offensive on September 14, Chiang Kai-shek transferred troops from the Hebei-Chahar battlefield to reinforce the Northeast. This reinforcement failed to prevent the Northeast Democratic Allied Army from winning its counteroffensive. Since the beginning of the counteroffensive, the Chiang army has suffered 68,000 casualties in the Northeast in a month and a half. On the Hebei battlefield, our People's Liberation Army won the Qingfengdian victory, annihilating more than 10,000 enemies, and then liberated Shijiazhuang, annihilating more than 20,000 enemies. Chiang's bandit troops are already so insufficient that, in the face of the offensive of our various armies, they can only haphazardly transfer troops, treating the head when it aches and the foot when it hurts. However, the result of transferring them back and forth is that they are defeated and annihilated everywhere, while our army is becoming more and more courageous and morale is high. The various armies are working together tirelessly and automatically. This is the reason why the Jin-Chahar-Hebei Field Army and the field armies in various liberated areas have won successive battles. This kind of tireless and automatic cooperation is a special characteristic of our people's army. The spokesperson also said: This time, the enemy defending Shijiazhuang numbered more than 20,000, and they received active assistance from the American-supplied Chiang bandit air force. However, the city was captured in only six days. It only took 20 to 30 minutes each time to break through each of the enemy's positions. The morale of Chiang's bandits is extremely low; and our army's military technology, thanks to the new weapons supplied by Chiang and the US, has been unprecedentedly improved. Chiang Kai-shek ordered the Chiang army in Shijiazhuang to defend to the death this time, and promised to provide reinforcements immediately. But the battle is already over, and the reinforcements are nowhere to be seen. As our army launches a major counteroffensive, Chiang Kai-shek's source of troops is becoming even more depleted, and at the same time, Chiang's bandit troops are constantly being annihilated by us on the battlefield, which will lead to a situation where, when cities of strategic significance are surrounded by our army, Chiang's bandits will not be able to send reinforcements at all. At that time, victories like the liberation of Shijiazhuang will come one after another. This situation is not far away, and the victory of Shijiazhuang itself is a beginning. The spokesperson said: At the same time as this battlefield victory, our Hubei-Henan-Anhui Liberation Army annihilated the enemy's 40th Division at Gaoshanpu near Guangji, our Jiangsu-Shandong-Henan-Anhui Liberation Army greatly defeated the Longhai Railway west of Xuzhou, our Henan-Shaanxi Liberation Army successively captured eight cities west of the Pinghan Railway, our Northwest Liberation Army surrounded Yulin, our Jin-Hebei-Lu-Yu Liberation Army surrounded Yuncheng, and our Shandong Liberation Army has also long since turned to the counteroffensive, annihilating a large number of enemies. Chiang's bandits are overwhelmed and at a loss, and the vast battlefield is full of Chiang's bandits' graves, spreading the good news of the Liberation Army's victories everywhere. The national counteroffensive has only been going on for four months, and the situation is already like this. There is no doubt that even greater victories will come in the future.

### 总部发言人评解放石家庄之捷　我军反攻使敌顾此失彼  更大胜利必将连串到来

　　总部发言人评解放石家庄之捷
  　我军反攻使敌顾此失彼
    更大胜利必将连串到来
    【新华社陕北十六日电】人民解放军总部发言人评解放石家庄之捷，指出：这是一个重要的胜利，并且是今后一连串重大胜利的开端。发言人指出：在东北民主联军于九月十四日发动攻势后，蒋介石从冀察战场上调兵赴东北增援，这种增援并未能阻止东北民主联军的反攻胜利。自反攻开始后，一个半月中蒋军在东北被歼已达六万八千人。而河北战场上，我人民解放军则取得清风店大捷歼敌万余，接着又解放石家庄歼敌二万余人。蒋匪兵力已经如此不足，在我各路大军攻势前面，只能把军队乱调一阵，头痛医头，脚痛医脚。但是，调来调去的结果，是到处打败仗、被消灭，而我军则愈战愈勇，士气高昂，各路大军不辞疲劳，自动的互相配合作战；这乃是晋察冀野战军及各解放区野战军所以连战连捷的原因。这种不辞疲劳自动配合，正是我人民军队的特长。发言人又说：此次石家庄敌守军达二万以上，并得到美国供给的蒋匪空军积极援助，然而仅仅六天，该城即被攻克。在突破敌人每一阵地时，每次只须二、三十分钟。蒋匪的士气是异常低落了；而我军的军事技术，多谢蒋美输送的新式武器，已经空前提高了。蒋介石此次命令石家庄蒋军死守，并允许立即给以增援。但是战斗已经结束，增援的部队还不知在那里。我军大举反攻，蒋介石兵源更加枯竭，同时蒋匪军队又不断被我歼灭在战场上，就会出现这样一种情况：就是当有战略意义的城市被我军包围时，蒋匪根本派不出援兵，那时象解放石家庄这样的胜利，就会一连串的到来。这种情况已经不远了，石家庄之捷本身就是一个开头。发言人称：在此战场胜利的同时，我鄂豫皖解放军在广济附近之高山铺歼敌第四十师，我苏鲁豫皖解放军在徐州以西大破陇海路，我豫陕解放军在平汉路西连克八城，我西北解放军包围榆林，我晋冀鲁豫解放军包围运城，我山东解放军亦早已转入反攻，大量歼敌。蒋匪顾此失彼，进退失据，广大的战场上到处都是蒋匪的坟墓，到处传播解放军的捷报。全国反攻还仅只有四个月，情形已是如此，今后更大胜利的到来是必然无疑的。
