　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: A comprehensive report from the Yugoslav News Agency, Athens, dated 6th to 9th: The Greek Democratic Army's offensive is increasing in scale, and the air force has participated in the war for the first time. In the central region, the Democratic Army launched a powerful offensive between Ofisa, Ofideria, and Dea, and with 800 well-equipped elite troops, launched a fierce attack on Ofisa with the first assistance from the air force. In the southern Morea Peninsula, a strong force of the Democratic Army attacked the small port of Itia, causing great panic in the Greek fascist government, which even dispatched two warships to fight. In the northwest, the Western Macedonian and Thracian Democratic Army Command burned down the railway station near Nisdos north of Drama, and destroyed a large number of railways. The unit also annihilated the Fascist Army Macedonian Command between Staropolis and Dantija, repelled the enemy's attack on the Kolonna Plateau with the assistance of tanks, and liberated the villages of Megali and Sturna. In other news, the Greek fascist government was shocked by the Democratic Army's fierce attack on the Morea Peninsula. A supreme military conference was held recently to discuss countermeasures, and it was decided that the Army General Staff would command three regional operations, and four newly formed battalions of the National Guard would rush to Morea to make a final struggle.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th: Athens News: According to the Greek Democratic Army Broadcasting Headquarters' comprehensive war report for October: Although the enemy has an advantage in manpower and equipment, the Democratic Army has victoriously repelled all enemy attacks in Thessaly, Florina, Kalajang, Lumeiliang, Baikangna, Weitai and other areas, and has won the initiative in all areas. The Central and Western, Western Macedonian, and Epirus Democratic Army Command jointly operated in the Mitisowo area on October 18. After three days of fierce fighting, they annihilated two enemy battalions and then stationed themselves in the city of Mitisowo. All enemy attempts to retake the city with a large force have failed. The Northwest Macedonian Central and Western Democratic Army Command victoriously repelled the enemy's attacks on Gelafana, Fuloria, and Kastoria from October 5 to 25. Another unit of the Democratic Army also broke into the Axis and Florina areas. In the central and eastern regions, the Thessaly Democratic Army Command launched a decisive offensive this month, broke through the south-central region of the Bandus Mountains, and liberated many villages. The Lumeiliang Command recaptured the mountainous areas of Ises and Qiaola again this month, and annihilated the 503rd Battalion of the enemy's "Cuigelai" Brigade in a battle near Grisu on the 5th. The Democratic Army achieved brilliant results this month, creating an example of a casualty ratio of 1:11 with the enemy. It is estimated that 950 enemies were killed, 750 were wounded, many were captured, and 50 automatic rifles, 40 Bren guns, 200,000 rounds of ammunition, 9 mortars, and a large amount of food, clothing, and other military supplies were seized.
