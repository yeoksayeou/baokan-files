　　Cixian Residents All Cry Out to Catch Chiang Kai-shek
　　Two Thousand Five Hundred Young Men Enlist
    [Report from our newspaper in Cixian] After the counter-offensive propaganda in Cixian, the victory inspired the people. The slogan "March to Nanjing and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive" spread throughout the banks of the Fuyang River. The peasants who had been liberated vied to go to the front lines. Fathers sending sons, wives sending husbands, older brothers encouraging younger brothers, and younger brothers sending older brothers to join the army became a common trend throughout the county. Zhao Pei, an old Party member in the city, sent his son to join the army. Shen Sanbao personally sent his older brothers Dabao and Erbao, and younger brothers Sibao and Wubao, all four together to kill the enemy. Niu Tinghuai, an old man from Moli Village, "sent his son to the army to express his heart." Cadres in Shenjia Village set an example, wanting to be a backing for Liu and Deng's army. Cadres in Sagu Village said, "The world is our world, if we don't join the army, who will?" In five days, a total of more than two thousand five hundred young men in the county enlisted in the army. The first district launched a mass movement to review new recruits. Fang Baoshan from Siqian Street was a target of struggle. As soon as he signed up, the masses said, "Can you still do things for us? Get lost!" Liu Zhijun was a minor target of struggle and was also screened out by the masses. The old men said, "With so many people watching, bad people can't even become soldiers. How can such an army not win battles?" (Jian Feng, Lian Xi)

    【本报磁县讯】磁县经过反攻大宣传，胜利鼓舞人心“打到南京去，活捉蒋介石”的口号，传遍滏阳河畔。翻身农民争上前线。父送子、妻送郎、兄劝弟、弟送兄的参军热潮普遍全县。城里老党员赵佩送儿参军，申三保亲送胞兄大保、二保，胞弟四保、五保四人一块杀敌。磨里村牛廷槐老汉“送子参军表表心”。申家庄干部以身作则要给刘邓大军作后盾。撒谷村干部说：“天下是咱们的天下，咱不参军谁参军？”五天内全县共有两千五百余名青壮年参军。一区展开群众性审查新兵运动，司前街房保山是个斗争对象，一报名群众说：“你还能为俺办事？滚蛋吧！”刘治钧是个小斗争对象，也被群众审掉。老汉们说：“人多眼明，坏人想当兵也不行，这样军队怎能不打胜仗。”（简峰、莲溪）
