    Yuncheng Second District
    Expanding Wheat Planting in Sandy Areas
    [This newspaper's dispatch from Jilu Yu on the 29th] "Planting brings harvest, one wheat equals three autumns." The Yuncheng Second District's sandy areas have proposed expanding the wheat planting area by one-third. This area is a sandy region. In about half of the 70-plus villages in the district, wheat was not grown in the past because there was too little rainfall, and the spring winds would sweep it all away. The masses in these villages, seeing the heavy rainfall this year, wanted to plant wheat, but were afraid of losing the wheat seeds. Based on this, the district promptly put forward two encouraging slogans: "Heavy rainfall this year, a bumper harvest next year," and "One wheat equals three autumns." For the remaining half of the villages, which could grow some wheat, more planting was requested. Each village's wheat planting plan has been formulated after deliberation. In Tongshu Liuzhuang village alone, the village plans to expand the wheat planting area by two *qing* this year. Currently, each village is further resolving issues of labor, livestock, and seeds, and some have already begun plowing.
    [Another dispatch] On the afternoon of the 4th of this month, as a light rain fell, the masses of Huidian, the Eighth District of Boping, gathered in the "Heroes' Room" to chat. Some were shelling corn with baskets, some were winding thread, and some were holding children. Wang Xiqing said: "Anyone who doesn't plant a few more *mu* of wheat this year is a fool. You won't encounter this kind of timely rain in ten or eight years. As the old saying goes: 'Planting brings harvest, one wheat equals three autumns!' Judging by this, even if you don't have manure for the land this year, you should still plant a few more *mu* of wheat. Estimating that one *mu* yields fifty *jin* isn't much, and at the current price, that can be exchanged for two hundred *jin* of sorghum. After harvesting the wheat, plant corn or beans, which can yield more than one hundred *jin* based on this year's situation. Even if you wait until next spring to plant millet or sorghum, you might not even harvest this much grain, and you don't even know if you'll get a harvest. You figure out which is better." Wu Dian'san said: "I was thinking of not planting anymore after I finished, but what you say is right, 'Distant water can't quench immediate thirst.' I'll plant those five *mu* and two *fen* of bean stubble, and harvest more wheat to feed our troops and beat old Jiang, that son-of-a-bitch." Then one person said he would plant three more *mu*, and another said he would plant a few more *mu*. After this calculation, another eighty or ninety *mu* were planted.
    [This newspaper's dispatch from Southern Hebei on the 29th] Dongguanqian Village in the Third District of Guangping is rectifying labor service and substitute plowing, adding livestock, and planting more late wheat. The village has very few livestock, making it difficult to complete the village's two-thirds wheat planting task. The reason why the masses are unwilling to raise livestock is because they are afraid of chaotic labor service and substitute plowing. Even if they raise livestock, they can't use them well; some people rely on borrowing livestock from relatives and friends. Based on the above situation, the following methods were discussed: (1) First, hold a meeting of organized masses to explain that planting wheat is for their own benefit. If you plant more wheat this year, you won't have trouble with food next spring. Also, explain that borrowing livestock from relatives and friends is both inconvenient and untimely, and at the same time propose that newly purchased livestock will not be used for labor service for one month. (2) The Farmers' Association should mobilize everyone to buy livestock or buy together based on the amount of land and family circumstances of each household. (3) Unify the use of animal power, and decide who plows first based on who clears the land first, so that the livestock are not used for odd jobs or left idle. The production committee will allocate livestock to the wheat fields of poor peasants to ensure that poor peasants plant more wheat, and will also implement exchange of materials or labor. (4) Military dependents' substitute plowing is fixed with people and livestock. Six military dependents' families plow 29 *mu* of land with livestock; four families plow 19 *mu* of land with human labor; and each member of the elderly team is responsible for plowing one *mu*. Currently, the village has added six cattle and two donkeys, and the masses are busy planting late wheat. The masses said one after another: "This method is good, this way our village can plant a lot more wheat." The elderly team said: "It's nothing to work harder in order to plant more wheat." The cattle raisers said: "Substitute plowing for military dependents is fixed, unlike the random assignments in the past." Military dependents also said: "This is better than randomly finding village cadres in the past."

    郓巨二区
    沙土地带扩大种麦
    【本报冀鲁豫二十九日电】“得种得收，一麦赶三秋”。郓巨二区沙土地带，提出扩大种麦面积三分之一。这个地区是个沙土窝，全区七十来个村庄，约有二分之一的村庄过去不收麦，因为雨水过少，春风一起就刮完了，在这些村庄里的群众，见到今年的雨水大，有种麦要求，但又怕搭麦种。根据这，区里便适时的提出两个鼓动口号：“今年雨水大，明年能丰收”，“一麦赶三秋”，对其余二分之一或多或少能种些麦子的村庄，要求再多种。各村种麦计划，已经过酝酿制出，仅桐树刘庄计划，全村今年要扩大种麦面积两顷。现各村进一步解决人力畜力及种子问题，并有的已开始耕种。
    【又息】博平八区还店本月四日下午下着纷纷的细雨，群众有的提着篮子搓棒子，有的拐线，还有抱孩子的，都集在“功臣室”里谈天，王西庆说：“今年谁不多种几亩麦子，算上了当。十年或八年的遇不着这应宜时的。老年的俗话：得种得收，一麦赶三秋！这样看来，今年没粪上地，也该多种几亩麦子，算一算一亩地里打五十斤不算多，合当时的价钱，能换二百斤高粱，割了麦子种上棒子或豆子，按今年的光景说，还能打一百多斤，就是等到明年春天种上谷子、高粱，也不能就打这些粮食，还不准收不收，你合合那头合适吧。”武殿三说：“我耩完了，想着不耩了，你这一说，不错不错，远井解不了近渴，我再耩上那五亩二分豆楂，多打点麦子，好供给咱的队伍吃，打老蒋那个王八蛋。”接着这个说再耩三亩，那个再种几亩，这样一计算，又多种了八、九十亩。
    【本报冀南二十九日电】广平三区东关前村，整顿支差代耕，增添牲畜多种晚麦。该村牲口很少，很难完成全村三分之二的种麦任务。群众不愿喂牲口的原因是怕支差乱，嫌代耕乱，喂牲口也不能好好用；有些人靠借亲戚朋友的牲口。根据以上情形，讨论出以下办法：（一）先召开有组织的群众会，说明种麦为自己。今年种麦多，明春粮食不作难。并解释借亲戚朋友的牲口既不方便又不适时，同时提出新买的牲口一月内不支差。（二）农会根据各户土地多少，家庭情形动员大家买牲口或伙买。（三）统一使用畜力，决定谁先腾地谁先犁，牲口不乱作零活，也不闲着。贫农的麦地由生产委员会调剂牲口，以保证贫农多种麦，并且实行物资或人力换工。（四）军属代耕固定人畜力。六户军属畜力代耕地二十九亩；人力代耕者四户，地十九亩，老年队每人负责代耕一亩。现该村已添买牛六头、驴二匹，群众都忙着种晚麦。群众纷纷说：“这个办法不错，这样咱村能多种好些麦子。”老年队说：“为的多种麦，多作活没啥。”喂牛户说：“给军属代耕有一定了，不象从前乱派了。”军属也说：“这比以前乱找村干强啦。”
