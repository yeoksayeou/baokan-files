[Report from our newspaper in Taiyue on the 7th] Women in Jincheng County are starting to spin and weave, and the county government has recently formulated a five-month spinning and weaving plan for the entire county this winter: 1. Of the 67,000 women in the county with labor power, everyone should learn to spin cotton. Among the more than 32,000 who can spin, each person is required to spin an average of ten catties of cotton this winter. Those who are newly learning to spin must complete eight catties, so that every household spins cotton and every village weaves cloth. 2. Train a large number of weavers and try to be able to both spin and weave. For every eight spinners, there must be one weaver; old weavers must complete ten bolts of cloth within five months, and new weavers must complete two bolts, striving for everyone to be able to wear a bolt of cloth within five months. Increase the number of looms in the county by 4,000. 3. Improve quality and improve technology, spinning finely and evenly, and weaving smoothly and densely. 4. The raw materials mainly rely on the masses to solve themselves. Spinning and weaving are combined with transportation. Transportation teams must transport a large amount of cotton from the west. The government and the Trade Bureau will regulate 100,000 catties of cotton and issue spinning and weaving loans of 20 million yuan. 5. Cooperatives in various villages should organize small carpentry factories according to the specific situation to manufacture spinning and weaving tools. County, district, and village cooperatives should help the masses solve the difficulties of spinning and weaving tools. 6. Advocate profit sharing between spinning and weaving women and their families, give more praise and rewards to spinning and weaving women, and launch a spinning and weaving meritorious service campaign.
[Report from our newspaper in Taiyue on the 11th] After the autumn planting and autumn plowing in Dongfeng, Yangcheng, the women began to spin and weave. The village held a mutual aid brigade meeting on the 3rd and summarized that after the autumn planting and autumn plowing, the women of each sub-team proposed to immediately switch to the spinning and weaving campaign. Everyone said, "The grain harvested this autumn is not enough to eat next spring. We must spin and weave well this winter and not eat a single grain from our family." Wang Xiran, a woman from the third sub-team, said with full of courage, "Gu Long's Hao Xiaosui became the county's spinning and weaving hero, why can't we?" Encouraged by her, fourteen women immediately volunteered to organize themselves, to spin five taels a day, guarantee to spin 300 catties of yarn this year, weave 150 bolts of cloth, and strive to earn 450,000 yuan in profit. Forty-nine women in the fourth sub-team, including thirty who can spin cotton and ten who can weave cloth, talked with confidence: "This winter, my sub-team will guarantee to weave one hundred bolts of cloth. In addition to food and expenses, we will earn the equivalent of twenty-six bolts of cloth to buy ten shi of rice and solve the spring famine next year." The military dependents in the fifth sub-team also happily organized a spinning and weaving group to solve the problem of food and drink next spring. Sixteen spinning and weaving groups in the entire village, with 123 people, have turned to the spinning and weaving campaign, guaranteeing to spin 1,920 catties of cotton and weave 960 bolts of cloth this winter.
[Report from our newspaper in Taiyue on the 11th] In order to develop spinning and weaving, the Fourth District of Qinshui held a discussion on October 27th for technical instructors of small spinning and weaving factories in the district to discuss how to train spinning women. Guo Jingshan, a spinning and weaving technician, said: "We are willing to let apprentices get on the machine quickly and learn quickly, but when new apprentices first come, they weave a zhang or so of cloth a day, while old apprentices can weave five zhang, but they will soon graduate, so not many finished products can be produced in a day, and the cooperative will lose money. This is a contradiction." After discussion, it was stipulated that old apprentices cannot all graduate. Leave one or two until the new apprentices can weave two or three zhang of cloth, and then the old apprentices can graduate completely. The idea of not wanting apprentices to graduate was also solved by calculating accounts. An old apprentice can weave five zhang of cloth in the factory, but putting him in the neighborhood can teach three to four apprentices. Teaching sixteen people to weave with four people is much more beneficial than one person weaving five zhang of cloth in the factory all the time. After everyone's thinking was straightened out in this way, they began to formulate meritorious service plans. Among them, the plan of Hou Changsheng, a teacher from the district cooperative, was the best. In addition to obeying the leadership of superiors and maintaining good relations with the masses, he was particularly willing to avoid technical secrets and patiently teach the stupid apprentices. Within the scope of the Fourth District, both small machines and flat machines are taken care of. From November to the end of December, it is guaranteed that one apprentice will graduate, and by the end of February next year, it is guaranteed that five apprentices will graduate. A double-link machine that can weave fifteen zhang of cloth a day will also be invented. It is statistically guaranteed that thirty apprentices will be taught in the entire district within four months.

　　晋、阳、沁等地妇女开始进行纺织
    【本报太岳七日电】晋城县政府近订出今冬五个月全县纺织计划：一、全县有劳力的妇女六万七千余人，要人人学会纺花，其中三万二千多个会纺的，每人平均要求今冬纺十斤棉花。新学纺的，要完成八斤。作到家家纺花，庄庄织布。二、大量培养织妇，尽量作到既能纺、又能织。每八个纺妇中，要有一个织妇；老织妇在五个月内要完成十匹布，新织妇完成两匹，争取五个月内人人都能穿到一匹布。全县增加织布机四千张。三、提高质量，提高技术，要纺的细、匀，织的平、密。四、原料主要依靠群众自己解决，纺织与运输结合，运输队要大量上西边运棉花，政府与贸易局调剂棉花十万斤，发放纺织贷款二千万元。五、各村合作社根据具体情况组织小型木匠厂，制造纺织工具，县区村合社都要帮助群众解决纺织工具的困难。六、提倡纺织妇女与家庭分红，对纺织妇女多表扬与奖励，开展纺织立功运动。
    【本报太岳十一日电】阳城董封秋种秋垡完毕，妇女开始纺织。该村于三日召开互助大队会议，总结了秋种秋垡后，各分队妇女皆提出要立即转入纺织运动，大家说：“今秋打的粮食不够明年春天吃，我们要在今冬好好纺织，不吃家里一颗粮食。”三分队妇女王喜然勇气十足的说：“固隆郝小穗当了全县的纺织英雄，咱就不能？”在她的鼓励下，立即有十四个妇女自愿结合组织起来，要每天纺五两，保证今年纺线三百斤，织布一百五十匹，争取赚利四十五万元。四分队四十九个妇女，即有三十人会纺花，十人会织布，她们很有信心的谈：“今冬我这个分队，要保证织一百匹布，除吃饭与化费外，要赚二十六匹布，买米十石，解决明年春荒。”五分队的军属妇女也高兴的组织一个纺织小组，解决明春吃喝困难，全村十六个纺织小组，一百二十三人已转入纺织运动，保证今冬纺花一千九百二十斤，织布九百六十匹。
    【本报太岳十一日电】沁水四区为发展纺织，于十月二十七日召开全区小型纺织工厂技术指导员讨论如何培养纺妇。纺织技师郭景山说：“我们愿意叫学徒赶快上机，赶快学会，但是新学徒刚来，每天织丈把布，旧学徒能织五丈，可是他们就要出师了，这样一天出不了多少成品，合作社就要赔钱，这是矛盾的。”经过讨论后，规定旧学徒不能全部出师，留下一两个等新学徒能织两三丈布时，旧学徒再完全出师。又以算帐的方法解决了不愿学徒出师的思想，一个旧学徒在厂里能织五丈布，但把他放到闾里可教三个至四个学徒，再以四人教会十六人织布，比一人老在厂里织布五丈的利益大得多。这样打通了大家思想后，就纷纷订起了立功计划，其中以区联社的教师侯长胜的计划最好，除服从上级领导和群众关系搞好外，特别是不保守技术，耐心教会心笨的学徒。在四区范围内，无论小机和平机一律照顾，十一月至十二月底保证出学徒一名，至明年二月底，保证出师五名，并要发明一张一天能织十五丈布的连二机，统计全区保证四个月内教会出师三十名。
