Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit government's betrayal of China's educational sovereignty and its acquiescence to American imperialist cultural aggression against China, the Chiang-American "Agreement on the Establishment of the United States Educational Foundation in China," was formally signed in Nanjing on the 10th. The agreement stipulates that the Chiang government must hand over to the United States government the equivalent of US$20 million from the sale of American surplus materials in Chiang currency as the cost of American cultural aggression against China for ten years. Under the "assistance" of this fund, "American citizens" can engage in so-called "research education and other educational activities" in all schools or institutions of higher learning within China, while the "educational activities of Chinese citizens" in the United States are limited to remote areas such as Hawaii, Alaska, and the Aleutian Islands. The United States may establish a five-member steering committee of the "United States Educational Foundation in China" in Nanjing, chaired by the American ambassador, to directly manage and guide this "educational program." The Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities can only appoint no more than five advisors to attend the "Steering Committee" meetings, but they have "no voting rights" and must obey their American masters in everything. The other four members of the "Steering Committee," in addition to two members of the American embassy, must also include one American businessman and one church member in China, to encourage them to actively participate in this cultural aggression activity. The meetings of the "Steering Committee" and its various affiliated subcommittees can be held anywhere in China, and "any staff member of the Foundation," as long as "approved" by the "Steering Committee," can "operate" anywhere in China, showing that American imperialism's future cultural aggression activities against China will be all-pervasive.

　　蒋贼出卖教育主权
  　放任美帝文化侵华
    【新华社陕北十三日电】蒋匪政府出卖中国教育主权，放任美帝国主义对华实行文化侵略之蒋美“设立美国对华教育基金会协定”，已于十日在南京正式签订。协定规定蒋政府须以美国剩余物资售款二千万美元等价之蒋币交付美国政府，作美国一十年对华文化侵略之费用。在此项基金“资助”之下，“美国公民”可在中国境内一切学校或高等学府从事所谓“研究教育及其他教育活动”，而“中国公民”在美国之教育活动则仅限于美国夏威夷、阿拉斯加、阿留申群岛等边远之地。美国得在南京设立一以美国大使为主席之“美国对华教育基金会”五人指导委员会，直接负责此项“教育计划”之“管理与指导”，蒋匪当局只能委任五人以下之顾问出席“指委会”会议，但“无投票权”，一切听命于其美国主子。该“指委会”其他四人，除美大使馆职员二人外，尚规定必须包括在华美国商人及教会人员各一人，促使他们积极参预此项文化侵略活动。“指委会”及其各附属小组委员会之会议，可在中国任何地点举行，“基金会任何职员”只要经“指委会”之“核准”，即可在中国一切地点“活动”；显示美帝国主义今后对华文化侵略活动将无孔不入。
