    [Report from Bo'ai by this newspaper] On the morning of the 25th of last month, masses in the Chengguan district, holding red flowers, gathered in groups, braving the muddy streets, with gongs and drums, to welcome the 350 returning heroes who participated in the southern campaign. When they marched into the venue in formation, carrying machine guns and rifles seized from the Chiang bandits, the crowd was excited and applauded enthusiastically, shouting: "Go south to fight Chiang Kai-shek, and bring back machine guns in victory!" Comrade Wang, deputy secretary of the county party committee, on behalf of all the party, government, and people's organizations in the county, expressed cordial greetings to them, saying: "Since you went south on August 16th, it has been two months and seven days today. Our county has undergone earth-shaking anti-traitor revenge and land reform movements. The people have been emancipated. Your families have also been emancipated. You have houses to live in, clothes to wear, and land to cultivate!" Subsequently, Chairman Wu of the Farmers' Association reported the victory across the river, saying: "Of the more than 1,700 people in our county who participated in the southern campaign, the first batch of 350 people have returned, bringing back three machine guns and 200 rifles. There are still many more to come." Nanzheng hero Niu Jinxing said: "The army fights in the front, and we transport ammunition in the rear. The common people in the opposite side (Chiang-occupied area) are in great pain. We have been emancipated and should help the people of Henan to be emancipated." Finally, the government issued awards, and the meeting was adjourned in a warm atmosphere of flower offerings and cheers. (Li Ping, Shou Xin, Fa Rong, Yu Wen)
    [Report from Lingchuan by this newspaper] The Lingchuan stretcher team and a squadron from the Qinyang stretcher team, totaling more than 1,700 people, followed the Chen Xie Qin and other armies on the southern campaign for a month and a half. Now they have completed their mission and returned victoriously. Along the way, the masses, in the midst of the busy autumn harvest and wheat planting, lined the streets to welcome this strong team of stretcher bearers. They overcame all difficulties and gloriously completed their tasks. The Second Brigade, responsible for transporting ammunition during the battle, with more than 400 people, when everyone was rushing to carry the wounded, proposed: "Why not let us rush to seize enemy weapons? Even if we are killed, we must participate in the stretcher team." After the leadership allowed it, they immediately rushed to the front line. Many model heroes emerged in the process of seizing enemy weapons. Wang Zhilong, deputy captain of the Sixth Brigade, spared no effort to sacrifice himself, rushed up with the army, and carried five enemy weapons from the front line in a row. He rushed from the front line and then transferred them to the north of the Yellow River. During the transfer, if there was no one in the village, they would boil water and find food themselves. Many team members let the wounded stay in their homes during rest, while they slept in the open. Many members of the Fifth and Sixth Brigades cleaned the wounds of the wounded and tore off their own clothes. Even in the case of heavy rain, muddy sandy roads, and no food, the team members were fearless. The people loved the people everywhere. When stationed in Guanzhuang, Xin'an, Wang Zhilong, deputy captain of the Sixth Brigade, saw an old woman whose landlord was starving her to death because of grain and money demands from the Chiang bandits. He immediately called on the team to save more than ten catties of white flour to save the old woman's life. He launched a grain lending campaign in the original village, found poor and hired laborers in the village, and carried out propaganda and exposed the fraud of Chiang bandits at any time and place.
