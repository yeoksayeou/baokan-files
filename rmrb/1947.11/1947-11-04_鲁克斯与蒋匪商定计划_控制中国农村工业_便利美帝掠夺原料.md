    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st. Various sources reveal that when UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Director Rusk was in China, he conspired with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities to develop a long-term plan for American imperialism to control the construction of China's rural industries. This plan is already being actively implemented. According to the Tianjin Yishibao, citing information from the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), the plan is expected to last three years, and its "work focus" is divided into four major areas: widely promoting American tractors and harvesters, establishing mechanized chemical fertilizer plants, opening rural small factories, and using machinery for fishing. It is planned to establish a large-scale general factory, 18 branch factories, and a large number of engineering stations, with the goal of producing 20 million pieces of agricultural equipment annually. In addition, the Central News Agency disclosed on the 29th that the "Post-War Enterprise Committee" Rural Work Demonstration Group, jointly controlled by Chiang Kai-shek and the United States to inherit the work of UNRRA, has recently been established and is accelerating the establishment of rural small factories and the training of technical personnel in this area. The eight small factories in Shaoyang, Hunan, originally under the CRRRA, have been taken over by the group. These factories are all of a permanent scale, and their main products now are paint, white powder, cement, sulfuric acid, glass, etc. In addition to continuing to expand and add such factories, the Demonstration Group plans to establish water plants, machinery manufacturing plants, iron smelting furnaces, and demonstration farms. As for the training of technical personnel, it is said that a large number are already in training, and the group plans to establish a rural industrial scientific research institution to strengthen this work. According to the Tianjin Minguo Daily, concrete steps have also been planned for establishing fertilizer plants, with a huge sum of 15 million US dollars earmarked to establish three major fertilizer plants in Sichuan, Hunan, and Hebei provinces. It is reported that the United States calculates that after all the above steps are completed, the United States will be able to completely control China's agricultural production, freely plunder China's raw materials, and fully supply the needs of American and Japanese industries.

    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd. American imperialism is actively deploying to monopolize China's fishing industry. The "Fisheries Inspection Team," formed under the name of UNRRA and CRRRA, is touring China's fishing areas to accelerate the implementation of this step to invade China. According to the Central News Agency, the "Fisheries Inspection Team" arrived at Haikou Port on Hainan Island on the 31st and will proceed to Yulin Port. The team stated that so-called "new-style fishing boats," originally belonging to CRRRA and completely controlled by American capital and American technology, will soon arrive on the island to "catch large quantities of fish," and the island's port fishing equipment will be strengthened in accordance with American technology. Hainan Island is one of China's five major fishing areas, and the Americans have long coveted it. The team's stay in Haikou and Yulin ports on the island is generally believed to be related to the US plan to establish a naval base on Hainan Island.

    鲁克斯与蒋匪商定计划
    控制中国农村工业
    便利美帝掠夺原料
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】各方消息透露联总署长鲁克斯在华时，曾与蒋匪当局商定一由美帝国主义控制中国农村工业建设之长期计划，此计划已在积极进行中。据天津益世报根据行总消息透露：该计划预期三年，其“工作重心”共分四大项，即广泛推行美国曳引机，收割机，建立机制化学肥料厂，开办农村小型工厂及利用机器捕鱼。预计设立大规模之总工厂一座，分工厂十八座，及大量工程站，做到每年生产农具二千万件。另中央社二十九日披露行总消息：最近设立由蒋美共同控制以继承联总工作之“善后事业委员会”乡村工作示范组，已在着手加紧进行设立农村小型工厂和训练此方面技术人员之工作。原行总所属湖南邵阳八个小型工厂即由该组接管，此等工厂皆具永久规模，现主要生产为漆，白粉，水泥，硫酸，玻璃等。示范组计划除继续扩充和增设此类工厂外，并另设自来水厂，机械制造厂，炼铁炉及示范农场。至于技术人员之训练，据称已有大批在受训中，该组并计划设立一乡村工业科学研究机构，以加强此方面工作。另据天津民国日报透露：设立肥料厂工作亦已拟定具体步骤，预定以一千五百万美元之巨款在川湘冀三省分设三大肥料厂。据悉：美国计算以上各项步骤全部完成后，美国即可完全掌握中国农业生产，放手掠夺中国原料，充分供应美国及日本工业之需要。
    【新华社陕北二日电】美帝国主义积极布署垄断中国渔业，以联总和行总名义组成的“渔业视察团”正遍游中国鱼产区，以加速此项侵华步骤之实现。据中央社消息，该“渔业视察团”已于三十一日到达海南岛海口港，并将赴榆林港。该团表示：原属行总完全为美国资本与美国技术控制之所谓“新式渔船”，即将到该岛“大量捕鱼”，该岛口岸捕鱼设备亦将按照美国技术予以加强。海南岛为中国五大鱼产区之一，美人对之觊觎已久。该团之在该岛海口及榆林港等地逗留，一般相信此与美国在海南岛设置海军基地之计划亦有关系。
