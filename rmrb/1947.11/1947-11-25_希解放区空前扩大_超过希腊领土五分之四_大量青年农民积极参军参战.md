Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd. Athens dispatch: Since the Greek Democratic Army began its counter-offensive in August, the liberated areas have expanded unprecedentedly. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Athens on the 16th, "The Greek Democratic Army now controls the area from north of the Gulf of Patras to the border with Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania, as well as every mountainous region, exceeding four-fifths of Greek territory. The government army only controls large cities, plains, and some islands. Currently, the Greek Democratic Army is continuing its victorious offensive; according to the Greek Democratic Army radio, Democratic Army units in the south liberated the area around Gytheio near Sparta. In the north, the Eastern Macedonia and Thrace Command has again fiercely attacked the city of Komotini. In the west, the Western Macedonia Command has fiercely attacked the city of Edessa and repelled strong enemy offensives in the areas of Kloposin and Melansu. The unit also fought two artillery brigades assisted by enemy air force in the Megali-Rachi area, killing or wounding 135 enemy soldiers."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. TASS dispatch: Peasants in the Greek liberated areas actively support the Democratic Army in its operations. Wherever the Democratic Army arrives, large numbers of young peasants immediately join the army. Peasants in the village of Krisou organized self-defense forces to cooperate with the Democratic Army in its operations, launching five fierce attacks on the fascist government forces, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. The people on the labor front have also launched a warm tide of support for the army. Hundreds of peasants in Ypati not only voluntarily donated grain but also expressed their willingness to increase cultivation and store grain for the Democratic Army.
