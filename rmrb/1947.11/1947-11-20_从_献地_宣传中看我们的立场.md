From the "Land Donation" Propaganda, Our Standpoint

    Jinsui Daily Editorial Department, Jinsui Xinhua General Branch

    From the second half of August last year to the beginning of November, the newspaper successively published many reports on "land donation." These reports were written by our reporters and correspondents and processed by the editors. Now, let us look at the issue of our class standpoint in the propaganda of "land donation" from the perspective of news business itself.

    I. Promoting the Landlord Class's "Support" for Land Reform through Liu Shaobai's "Land Donation"

    On August 13th last year, this newspaper published the news that "Vice Chairman Liu and his brother (i.e., the big landlord and local tyrant Liu Xiangkun, who was liquidated and suppressed by the masses of Heiyukou on August 27th this year) donated land and houses to the peasants." The article quoted a series of high-sounding words from Liu Shaobai, portraying Liu Shaobai, the spokesperson for the landlord class, as if he supported land reform. Not only that, but the author also praised Liu Shaobai in the introduction of his resume, saying that Liu Shaobai "has been enthusiastic about the revolutionary cause throughout his life," "personally participated in the construction of the Jinsui Liberated Area since 1940," "had long recognized the principle of 'land to the tiller' and regarded it as a long-cherished wish, and had proposed to hand over the land to the government for disposal as early as 1931." "After the publication of Chairman Mao's 'On Coalition Government,' he wrote to Vice Director Wu last year (referring to 1945) when he stayed in Yan'an, asking to exempt all rent and interest from his tenants." What was the truth? Not to mention twenty years ago, according to the materials recently revealed by Comrade Liu Yizhong, a reader of this newspaper: even last year, he sent his guards with rifles to intimidate the peasants and force rent from the tenants. Also, last year, when the masses of a village in the sixth district of Xingxian County were liquidating Liu Shaobai's brother-in-law (a landlord and local tyrant), Liu also "complained" everywhere for him and firmly opposed the reasonable demands of the peasants. Furthermore, when the case of Li Shaorong, a landlord in Lijiawan, forging letters from the military region leaders to defraud the bank of gold occurred this year, Liu Shaobai also wrote to the leading organs, actively "appealing" for the landlord. Look how beautifully we did free publicity for the landlord class, truly bringing a flourish to the pen! This is just one typical example.

    II. Propagating the Landlord Class's "Lay Down the Butcher Knife and Become a Buddha on the Spot"

    The news of Li Chengzhen, a member of the Fangshan County Council, "donating land" on August 13th said something like "Mr. Li made sincere criticisms of his past deeds at the mass rent reduction and liquidation meeting(?)" etc. When answering questions raised by the masses, Li said: "One is not clean living in the old society. People say I am enlightened, but it is actually just on the surface. The tenant Hao Shenghua had to provide me with two mu of watered land for free in order to rent some land, without getting any compensation for two years, and we also jointly raised a cow, and after the cow died, I completely took the cowhide and meat for myself. There were many such extra exploitations." Therefore, Li Chengzhen "felt that the landlord's exploitation was hindering the development of production since the liberation of Fangshan last year (1945)." This report obliterated the class nature of the landlord class, as if the landlord class had already recognized the sins of exploiting the peasants in the past and was determined to "repent and reform." It is especially worth noting that his speech at the "mass rent reduction and liquidation meeting" was also "answering questions raised by the masses." Obviously, this was a beautiful speech under the coercion of the masses' strength, attempting to paralyze and soften the masses and undermine rent reduction and liquidation. We did not conduct in-depth research, but instead promoted it vigorously, which played a role in paralyzing ourselves and the masses in terms of class ideology.

    III. Promoting Landlords Becoming "Working People" after "Donating Land"

    The report on "Gentry Landlords 'Donating Land' in Liulin City" on August 16th said: "At the symposium of gentry landlords held by the Liulin Municipal Government, everyone was very excited after the landlords 'donated land'(?). Mr. Ma Mingteng, a member of the County Council, said: 'This meeting was very good, like a bathing pond, washing away our exploitative thoughts and truly implementing Sun Yat-sen's principle of land to the tiller.' After the meeting, Mr. Ma Mingteng went to bed late and got up early, working diligently in production, and his enthusiasm for labor was even praised by the masses." This report also shows that we were pitifully naive in politics, and we were completely blinded by the conspiracies of the landlord class.

    IV. Promoting Government Praise and Mass "Gratitude" after Landlords "Donate Land"

    The August 26th report stated: "After Wu Jinqing, Speaker of the Wuzhai County Council, 'donated land,' the county government representative expressed his gratitude to the masses of Wuzhai." On August 29th, landlords in Ningwu spontaneously convened a meeting to "donate" land, donating a total of one thousand mu of land. "Comrade Yang Jin, Political Commissar of the County, expressed his extreme praise for the wise move of the gentlemen. Comrade Zhang Chuyuan, Director of the County Farmers' Association, also expressed his warm welcome on behalf of the peasants." After Zheng Weiyuan, a landlord in Huijiaping Village, Zhongyang, "donated land," the village office held a mass meeting on August 15th to warmly "welcome" him. It was written that the peasants were "grateful" for the landlords' "land donation," and the government praised it extremely. This kind of report without any standpoint is a great insult to our peasants, and we should apologize to the peasants here!

    V. We are not vigilant against the conspiracies of the landlord class to sabotage land reform in the propaganda of landlords' "land donation"

    (1) "Donating" land to tenants and renting it out in disguised form - The news of Wang Zaizhong, the principal of Xinxian Elementary School, "donating land" on August 25th said: "He divided 20 mu of land to six tenants, including Liang Yousheng and Zhang Wenhai, a month ago, and signed a contract to determine the land ownership, and distributed the remaining 30 mu to poor people in the village for cultivation, only paying two stones of grain each year to maintain the lives of his wife and granddaughter."

    (2) Using "land donation" to evade liquidation and protect other large amounts of property - On August 18th, Zhou Dianshi, the secretary of Xinbao Village, "persuaded" his father to donate land and houses: "I am the secretary, and my third brother is a teacher. Look at those poor people who have no land and no houses. It is right for us to take out a part of the land and houses to help them turn over. Our family is doing well, and we also have oil mills, water mills, mules, and flat land."

    (3) After the landlords donate land, they still retain a large amount of land and good land. When all the landlords donate land, they all say that they will "keep enough land for living," but they did not say what quality of land was left and "donated" (the deception of land donation is mainly reflected in leaving good land and returning bad land). The news of Sun Bazi, a landlord in Jining, "donating land" on August 3rd said: "Sun Bazi has more than ten qing of land (a big landlord!), twenty livestock. He gave the peasants more than six qing and seventy mu of land, twelve livestock, and forty-five sheep." The land they returned was "land other than their own cultivation," which was obviously bad land, because no one would give up good land to cultivate bad land. After "donating land," they still kept four hundred mu of good land and eight livestock.

    (4) Landlords use the means of consoling the families of soldiers to cover up their conspiracy to sell a large amount of land by taking the opportunity - On August 13th, it was reported: "Li Chengzhen, a member of the Fangshan County Council, used the price of 50,000 yuan (?) from the land sold at the rent reduction and liquidation meeting to console (?) the troops, and used all the income from 19 mu (it can be seen that more than 19 mu were sold) to console (?) the poor families of soldiers."

    (5) Objectively publicizing that it is legal for landlords to change the way of exploitation. -- October 22, it was reported that after Wang Huaizhen in Lanxian "donated land," he "also planned to raise a cow and cultivate the land with the villagers (actually, he wanted the peasants to work for free!), solve the grain problem. And buy a fast machine so that the women can weave cloth with the women in the village (textiles are not a burden, and you can exploit them by using the machine!)"

    (6) The deceptive conspiracies of the landlord class are publicized as if they are doing "good deeds," and whether the masses oppose it or not is not considered. The August 18th report on Niu Youlan's "donation of rice" in Xingxian is the most typical example. Previously, the masses of a village in Beilan County wanted to liquidate him because he had embezzled the grain given to the Red Army by the masses when the Red Army crossed the river to the east. After he learned of this, he bought thirty dan of rice from the Xing City market. At the mass struggle meeting, he only had to pay fifteen dan, after he returned from Lan County and saw Liu Shaobai "donating land," he also pretended to be "enlightened," so he gave the remaining fifteen dan to the Xingxian County government. Liu, the county chief of Xingxian, asked to publish it and praise him, and the reporter did not consider its impact on the masses, and praised Niu's "donation" of rice. He didn't ask about the liquidation of Niu's embezzlement by the masses in a village in Lan County even though he knew about it.

    From the above facts, it can be seen how we did free publicity for the landlord class in the "land donation" propaganda, how we blinded the masses' understanding of the nature of the landlord class, and how we lost the proletariat's standpoint. This is a serious mistake in our past propaganda work. The occurrence of this error is because we do not recognize the nature of the landlord class, we are not alert to the feudal ruling class for thousands of years, and our class viewpoint is very vague. Such as:

    The small commentary on "Understanding Landlords' Land Donation" on September 30 said: "For the big landlords, tyrants and bullies, we must be highly vigilant and mobilize the masses to liquidate those who should be liquidated." "Landlords donate land because of the result of the mass movement. Some far-sighted landlords realize that this is the general trend and are willing to stand with the peasants and donate their land. This is by no means an occasional act of mercy by the landlords." It can be seen from the article that we still did not understand and accept the Party's policy of thoroughly eliminating feudalism at that time, and did not treat the landlord as a whole class. Therefore, although we have realized that the "land donation" or "enlightenment" of the landlord is a deceptive means for the landlord to escape liquidation; on the other hand, we say that there are some "far-sighted landlords" who do this and that. As a result, we blindfolded our eyes with one hand again. This is not only due to the overestimation of the mass movement in the border area at that time, but the most basic thing is that this is a concrete manifestation of our lack of a clear and firm class standpoint.

　　从“献地”宣传中看我们的立场
    晋绥日报编辑部　晋绥新华总分社
    去年八月下半月开始，到十一月初，报上陆续的登载过不少“献地”的报导，这些报导都是我们的记者、通讯员写的，经过编辑处理的。现在，我们就单从新闻业务本身，来看我们在宣传“献地”中的阶级立场问题。
    一、从刘少白“献地”中宣传地主阶级“拥护”土改
    去年八月十三日本报刊登“刘副议长及其胞弟（即今年八月二十七日为黑峪口群众清算镇压了的大地主恶霸刘象坤）向农民献出土地房屋”的消息，文中引证了刘少白的一串冠冕堂皇的漂亮话，把刘少白这个地主代言人，描写的煞象拥护土地改革似的，不仅如此，作者更在介绍刘少白的简历中为之大捧一番，说刘少白“一生热心革命事业”，“本人自民国二十九年即参加晋绥解放区建设工作”，“对耕者有其田的主张，早有认识并视为夙愿，远在民国二十年前即有将土地交政府处理的倡议。”“毛主席论联合政府一书发表后，去年（指四五年）留延时曾致函武副主任，要免除其佃户的一切租息。”事实如何呢？不用说他廿年前了，据最近本报读者刘一钟同志揭露的材料说：就是在去年的时候，他曾派他的警卫员背上连枪，唬吓农民，向佃户逼要租子。又去年兴县六区某村群众向刘少白的内弟（地主恶霸）进行清算时，刘亦到处为其“叫苦”，坚决反对农民合理要求。再即今年李家湾地主李韶荣伪造军区首长信件向银行骗取黄金案发生时，刘少白也即致书领导机关，积极为该地主“伸冤”。你看我们为地主阶级做义务宣传做得多么漂亮，真是笔下生花了！这不过是其中一个典型例子而已。
    二、宣传地主阶级“放下屠刀立地成佛”
    八月十三日方山县议员李成榛“献地”的消息中说什么“李先生在群众减租清算大会上，对自己过去所作所为，作了恳切的批评（？）”等等。李某在答复群众所提问题时，又说：“生在旧社会里自己就不干净，人家说咱开明，实际是个表面，佃户郝生华为了佃些地，除交租外，还给自己捎种水地二亩，两年内没得一点代价，又合伙喂了一条牛，牛死后，牛皮肉自己完全独吞，象这样额外剥削还很多。”因此李成榛自“去年（四五年）方山解放后，即感到地主的剥削对发展生产之阻碍。”这篇报导抹煞了地主阶级的阶级本质，好象地主阶级已经认识了过去剥削农民的罪恶而决心“悔过自新”似的。特别值得注意的是他在“群众减租清算大会上”的发言，同时又是“答复群众所提问题”，显然这是在群众力量威迫下的一段漂亮话，企图以此麻痹软化群众，破坏减租清算，我们不作深刻研究，就替他大肆宣传起来，这种宣传，在阶级思想上起了麻痹我们自己和群众的作用。
    三、宣传地主“献地”后，变成“劳动人民”
    八月十六日“柳林市士绅地主‘献地’的报导中说：‘柳林市政府召开的士绅地主座谈会上，地主‘献地’后大家都很兴奋（？）县议员马明腾先生说：‘这个会开得很好，好比是一个洗澡塘，把我们的剥削思想都洗净，真正实行了孙中山先生耕者有其田的主张。’会后马明腾先生迟睡早起，勤劳生产，他那种劳动的热情更得到群众的赞扬。”这篇报导也说明我们在政治上幼稚得可怜，我们被地主阶级的阴谋诡计完全蒙蔽了。
    四、宣传地主“献地”后，政府赞扬与群众“感激”
    八月二十六日报导：“五寨县议长武进卿‘献地’后，县府代表五寨群众表示谢意”。八月二十九日，宁武地主自动召开“献”田会议，共献出土地千亩，“县政委杨瑾同志对诸先生此一贤明之举极表赞扬。县农会主任张初元同志，也代表农民表示热烈欢迎。”中阳惠家坪村地主郑维元“献地”后，村公所特于八月十五日召开群众大会，热烈“欢迎”。写得农民对地主的“献地”不胜“感激”，政府则极为赞扬。这种毫无立场的报导，对我们农民实在是一个极大的侮辱，我们应该在这里向农民请罪！
    五、在宣传地主的“献地”中，对地主阶级破坏土地改革的阴谋手段，毫无警惕
    （一）把土地“献”给佃户和变相出租——八月二十五日忻县完小校长王在中“献地”消息中说：“他于月前将土地二十亩分给梁有生、张文海等六家佃户，写立契约，确定地权，其余三十亩分配给本村贫民耕种，每年仅交两石食粮，以维持其妻及孙女两人的生活。”
    （二）以“献地”来逃避清算，保护其他大量财产——八月十八日，新堡村书记周殿士“说服”他父亲献出房地：“我当书记，三弟当教员，你看那些穷人没地没房，咱们拿出一部分土地房子，帮助他们翻身是应该的。咱们家里光景很好，还有油坊、水磨、骡子、平地。”
    （三）地主献地后，仍保存大量土地和好地，在所有地主献地时都是说“留下足够生活”的土地，但都没有说出留下和“献”出的是什么质量的地（献地的欺骗性，主要就表现在留好地退坏地）。八月三日集宁地主孙八子“献地”消息中说：“孙八子有地十顷多（大地主呀！）牲口二十头，给农民让出地六顷零七十多亩，牲口十二头，羊子四十五只。”他们所退出的地是“自己耕种以外的土地”，显然是坏地，因为谁都不会丢下好地种坏地，“献地”后仍保存四百亩好地，八头牲口。
    （四）地主以慰劳部队军属手段，掩盖其乘机大量出卖土地阴谋——八月十三日报导：方山县议员李成榛在减租清算大会上，将卖出的土地地价五万元（？），慰劳（？）部队，又在卖出的土地中，以十九亩（可见卖的不止十九亩）全部收入慰劳（？）了贫苦军属。”
    （五）客观上宣传化形地主改变剥削方式是合法的。——十月二十二日报导岚县王槐珍“献地”后“还计划养牛一条和村里人变工耕种（实际上是要农民无偿劳役！），解决口粮。并买一架快机，让婆姨们与村里妇女变工织布，解决穿衣。”（纺织不负担，又可出凭机子进行剥削！）
    （六）把地主阶级的欺骗阴谋手段，当成他们是做“好事”，来大肆宣传，群众反对不反对，也不考虑。八月十八日兴县牛友兰“献米”的报导，是一个最典型的例子。原先碑岚县某村群众要清算他，因他在红军东渡时把群众给红军的粮食贪污了，他知道此事后，从兴市集上买了三十石米，在群众斗争会上，只要了他十五石，他从岚县回来后看到刘少白“献地”，也来假装“开明”，于是把其余的十五石给了兴县县政府，兴县刘县长叫登报表扬，记者也未考虑其对群众影响如何，对牛的“献”米表扬了一番，对岚县某村群众清算牛贪污一事，知道了问也不问。
    从以上的事实中，可以看出，我们在“献地”宣传中如何替地主阶级作了义务宣传，如何在群众中蒙蔽了对地主阶级本质的认识，如何丧失了无产阶级的立场。这是我们过去宣传工作中的严重错误。这种错误的发生，是由于我们对地主阶级本质没有认识，对数千年来的封建统治阶级，毫无警觉，阶级观点非常麻糊。如：
    九月三十日“对地主献地的认识”小评中说：“对于豪绅恶霸这些大地主，必须提高警惕，该清算的一定要发动群众清算。”“地主献地是由于群众运动的结果，有些有远见的地主认识到这是大势之所趋，愿意与农民站在一起，而献出自己的土地，这绝不是地主偶然的大发慈悲。”从文中可以看出我们当时对党的彻底消灭封建的政策，依然没有了解与接受，没有把地主当一个整个的阶级来看待，因而一方面虽已觉察到地主的“献地”或“开明”，是地主逃避清算的欺骗手段；另一面又说有什么“有远见的地主”如何如何，结果一只手又把自己的眼睛蒙住。这不仅仅是由于当时对边区群众运动作了过高的估计，最基本的，这是我们缺乏明确坚定的阶级立场的具体表现。
