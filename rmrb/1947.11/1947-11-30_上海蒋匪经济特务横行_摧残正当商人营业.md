Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. After the Chiang Kai-shek government formed the so-called "Economic Police" in various cities last month and launched activities, many legitimate industrial, commercial, and financial operators in the KMT-controlled areas have been subjected to searches, extortion, arrests, and imprisonment. According to incomplete materials disclosed by Shanghai newspapers, in just half a month, from the 3rd to the 21st of last month, the Chiang bandit "Economic Police" in Shanghai alone, on the grounds of absurd charges such as "waiting and seeing without selling," "no entry permit," and "using gestures instead of reporting market prices," raided more than 20 yarn, grain, money houses, and other businesses. At least 35 businessmen from various industries were arrested and imprisoned. On the 7th of last month, a reporter from an economic news agency, forced to copy market quotations in the rice market to maintain his livelihood, was also arrested by Chiang bandit "economic spies" on the charge of "raising prices." On the 3rd, the small amount of gasoline and diesel oil stored by the Yisheng Rubber Factory, which were necessary raw materials for rubber production, were also seized by Chiang bandit economic agents under the pretext of "suspected hoarding." The price increases caused by the Chiang bandit government's massive and continuous issuance of banknotes have not fallen back due to the Chiang Kai-shek gang's destruction of the legitimate market. On the 11th of last month, when the Chiang bandit "Economic Police" inspected market permits, the price of rice immediately rose by 450,000 yuan per stone. Xuan Tie, commander of the Chiang bandit garrison in Shanghai, clamored to adopt a "public sales system" and drafted a "blacklist" of legitimate businessmen, preparing for a larger-scale arrest, and had already set a daily target of raiding ten factories and businesses. The Chiang bandit municipal government meeting on the 24th also stipulated that "all companies, factories, and businesses that contract to sell (Chiang bandit) government and state-owned agency rations must have legally completed company, factory, or business registration," and also used various methods to restrict the handling of "rationed" materials by various manufacturers, which is tantamount to finally depriving legitimate businessmen of the opportunity to engage in industrial and commercial operations. Furthermore, after the Chiang bandit Jiangsu Wuxi County government arrested seven yarn and cloth merchants on the 8th of last month, it arrested 116 grain merchants on the 18th. On the same day, a young man named Chen Shilin, originally a rice shop employee, made a living by selling rice after losing his job. He happened to buy two stones of rice that day and encountered a Chiang agent inspection. Fearing arrest, he jumped from the three-zhang high second floor to escape and was injured. Due to the suppression by the Chiang bandit county government, the Suzhou cotton yarn market completely ceased trading on the 6th of last month. After suppressing legitimate businessmen, Chiang bandit officials in Hefei, Anhui, took the opportunity to do big business. On the 1st of last month, the price of rice was 280,000 yuan per stone, and on the 3rd, it rose to 420,000 yuan. It is said that this price increase was caused by a certain "big shot" instructing his minions to purchase food, manipulating it from the inside.

　　上海蒋匪经济特务横行
  　摧残正当商人营业
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】蒋匪政府于上月间在各城市组成所谓“经济警察”并展开活动后，蒋管区许多正当工商金融业者已横遭搜查、勒索与逮捕监禁。据沪报披露之不完全材料总计：自上月三日至二十一日半个月内，上海一地蒋匪“经济警察”即以“观望不卖”、“无入场证”、“以手势代报行情”等无奇不有的罪名，抄查纱、粮、钱庄及各业行号达二十余家之多，各业商人至少有三十五人以上被逮捕监禁。上月七日，在某经济通讯社记者为维持一家生计，被迫在米市场兼抄行情单，亦被蒋匪“经济特务”以“抬价”罪捕去，三日义生橡胶厂所贮存为数不多，且为制橡必需原料之汽油、柴油亦被蒋匪经特以“囤积嫌疑”名义查封。由于蒋匪政府大量不断滥发纸币而引起之物价上涨，并未因蒋家匪帮摧残正当市场而回跌。上月十一日蒋匪“经济警察”检查市场证时，转瞬之间，米每石即上涨四十五万元。沪市蒋匪警备司令宣铁召叫嚣采取“公卖制度”，并拟出正当商人的“黑单”一纸，准备作更大规模逮捕，并已定每日抄查厂号十家。二十四日蒋匪市府会议亦规定“凡承销（蒋匪）政府及国营机关配售之公司、工厂、商号必须曾经依法办理公司、工厂或商业登记”者，并且又以种种办法限制各厂商对于“配售”物资的处理，无异最后剥夺正当商人从事经营工商之机会。又讯：蒋匪江苏无锡县府于上月八日逮捕纱布商七人之后，又于十八日逮捕粮商一百十六人。当天有青年陈士麟者，原系米号职员，失业后以贩米为生，该日彼曾购米两石，恰遇蒋特检查，恐遭逮捕，竟自高达三丈之二楼跳下图逃而受伤。苏州棉纱市场由于蒋匪县府之镇压，上月六日已全部停止交易。安徽合肥蒋匪官员于打击正当商人后，竟乘机大做生意。上月一日米价每石为二十八万元，三日即涨到四十二万元。此次涨风，闻即系因某“大员”授意喽罗购食粮，从中操纵所致。
