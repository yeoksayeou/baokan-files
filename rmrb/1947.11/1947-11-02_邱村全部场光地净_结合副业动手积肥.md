    (From our Changzhi correspondent) The Qiucun area held a mass meeting of all villagers on the 22nd of this month to summarize the autumn harvest and autumn plowing. This year's autumn harvest was particularly quick due to good organization. Last year, the autumn harvest took half a month to complete, but this year it was finished in five days. Plowing and digging the land was originally planned to take ten days for the whole village, but this year it was completed in seven days. In total, 2,450 workdays were saved. Now that the fields are cleared and the ground is clean, life is easier. We should start sideline occupations and accumulate manure early, combining them to ensure that agriculture, sideline occupations, and manure accumulation are all done well. Everyone agreed that it is better to start early! Ma Dongzhi said, "It's hard to work when it's freezing, your hands and feet get cold. Let's take advantage of the warm weather and get started early!" Guo Guozhen said, "My household finished its work two days early. We must seize the time to engage in sideline occupations and not stop. Our village should all make plans, divide the work, and get it done quickly. This year, I will accumulate fifteen large cartloads of manure per mu, and next year I will also plant one mu of indigo." Guo Renzhi said, "Don't overemphasize sideline occupations, but don't neglect agriculture either. My team doesn't neglect either. Eight livestock plow 240 mu of autumn land, four livestock transport goods, two livestock haul river soil to accumulate manure, and two livestock pull the millstone and haul coal. Now that harvesting, threshing, and plowing are all finished, we must seize the time to accumulate manure. The soil north of our village is black soil. Hauling river soil is best. The soil is good. If we don't accumulate manure, it won't work." Ma Dongzhi said, "My team has 150 mu of autumn land. We need to accumulate 1,000 cartloads of soil manure and buy 400 cartloads of night soil. This year we benefited from applying manure, yielding an extra five dou of grain per mu. We will start accumulating manure early this year." Zhao Lianzhi said, "Our village has an average of three and three-tenths mu of land per person. Agriculture as the main occupation combined with sideline occupations is the only way to achieve a surplus after farming. My team has 65 people and seven livestock. The whole team implements division of labor for transportation and fertilizer accumulation. The whole team has 180 mu of autumn land, and each mu needs to accumulate fifteen large cartloads of fertilizer, accumulating 1,000 large cartloads of soil manure." Under the influence of Zhao Lianzhi's team leadership, all seven teams in the village have combined agriculture and sideline occupations, and all laborers have become shareholders. Work is divided, and seven agricultural and sideline occupation mutual aid societies have been established. Everyone is working with great energy. Lianzhi said, "By the end of the year, the entire village must earn seven million yuan to truly achieve a surplus after farming." A mass meeting was held on the ninth of this month. Everything was discussed and decided. Ten livestock were selected to transport goods first, earning 50,000 yuan per trip. Two teams of livestock were also selected to plow land in Bitou in exchange for labor. Now that we are organized, there is not a single idle person in the village.

    邱村全部场光地净
    结合副业动手积肥
    【本报长治讯】一区邱村本月二十二号召开全村群众大会，总结秋收秋耕。今年秋收，因为组织起来特别快，去年秋半个月没收净，今年秋收五天完成，犁掘地原计划十天全村完成，今年七天即场光地净，总共省了二千四百五十个工，现已场光地净啦，生活紧前不紧后，早些下手搞副业积粪，结合起来达到农副业积粪三不误，大家研究早动手才对哩！马东只说：“冻了不好干，冻手冻足，借天气暖和早些干吧！”郭过珍说：“我的生活早二天就完啦，咱要抓紧搞副业，不要停止，把咱村都做计划，分开工，快些干。我今年每亩积十五大车粪，明年还种一亩小蓝。”郭仁枝说：“也不重副，也不轻农，我组都不误，八个牲口耕秋地二百四十亩，四个牲口运输，二个牲口拉河土积粪，二个牲口拉碾子、拉煤。现在收、打、犁都完啦，要抓紧积粪，咱村村北土是黑地，拉河土最好，土倒土打石五，不积粪不行”。马东只说：“我组有一百五十亩秋地，要积一千车土粪，还买四百车大粪，今年上粪沾了光，每亩多打五斗粮，今年早动手积粪”。赵连枝说：“咱村每人平均三亩三分地，农业为主要和副业结合起来才能达到耕二余一。我组有六十五个人，牲口七个，全组运输积肥等实行分工，全组一百八十亩秋地，每亩要积十五大车肥。积土粪一千大车。在赵连枝组领导影响下，全村七个组农副业都结合起来了，劳力都入了股，分开工，成立了七个农副业结合互助社，大家干起来一股劲。连枝说：“年底全村赚到七百万元非达到耕二余一不行。”本月初九召开了群众大会，都研究好，抽出十个牲口先运输，一回赚五万元，还要抽出二犋牲口去壁头犁地变工，现在组织起来全村还是没一个闲人。
