Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th—Following the Chiang bandit's shooting of Du Bincheng, head of the Northwest General Branch of the Democratic League, earlier this month, and the frenzied arrest of Democratic League members throughout the country, surveillance of the Democratic League headquarters in Nanjing, and deprivation of the freedom of movement of Democratic League leaders, according to a dispatch from the Chiang bandit's Central News Agency in Nanjing on the 27th, the Chiang bandit government's Ministry of Interior brazenly declared the Democratic League an "illegal organization" on the 27th. The formal declaration of this peaceful democratic party as "illegal" marks the utter panic, isolation, and frenzy of the moribund Chiang bandit. This move is tantamount to declaring the final political bankruptcy of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Since the Political Consultative Conference, the Democratic League, which has been subjected to persecution by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, has never obtained genuine legal status under Chiang Kai-shek's rule. From the Political Consultative Conference until recently, Democratic League Central Committee members murdered by the Chiang bandit include Li Gongpu, Wen Yiduo, and Du Bincheng; those beaten include Democratic League Chairman Zhang Lan and Li Gongpu (later shot and killed by Chiang bandit secret agents); Central Committee members arrested include Fan Puqi, Zhang Zhihe, and Yang Bokai; and the number of cadres and members below the Central Committee level who have been killed or arrested is countless. As for the Democratic League's propaganda organs, such as the Democratic Daily and Democratic Weekly in Chongqing, the Democratic Weekly in Kunming and Beiping, the Huaxi Evening News in Chengdu, and the joint edition of the Industrial and Commercial News and Qinfeng Daily in Xi'an, they have all long been shut down by the Chiang bandit. These bloody atrocities of the Chiang bandit demonstrate that the Democratic League had already been severely devastated and had no room for activity before being declared "illegal." Now, the Chiang bandit's declaration of the Democratic League as "illegal" completely exposes the hideous true face of its fascist bandit gang to the world.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th—United Press, Shanghai, 28th: After the Chiang bandit Ministry of Interior declared the Democratic League an "illegal organization," Democratic League Chairman Zhang Lan stated that the Democratic League's position of opposing the pseudo-constitution and striving for democracy remains unchanged. Zhang emphasized, "Our consistent policy of faithfully implementing the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and establishing a genuine coalition government through peaceful democracy remains unchanged." Zhang condemned Chiang bandit's move as the final step in strangling the Democratic League, attempting to force the Democratic League to participate in Chiang bandit's anti-people civil war and recognize the pseudo-constitution, and declared, "The Democratic League hopes for democracy and peace in China, but has always adopted a reserved attitude toward the constitutional issue, because the constitution passed by the (Chiang bandit) National Assembly does not strictly adhere to the Political Consultative Conference's guidelines." According to reports from United Press and Agence France-Presse on the 29th, Zhang Lan anticipates a large number of Democratic League members will be arrested and stated that he has ordered the Democratic League to temporarily cease activities, but the Democratic League's overseas branches may remain unrestricted.

    蒋匪途穷面目更狰狞
    悍然宣布民盟“非法”
    张澜宣称争取民主立场不变
    【新华社陕北三十日电】继本月初蒋贼枪杀民盟西北总支部负责人杜斌丞，在各地疯狂逮捕民盟盟员、监视南京民盟总部、剥夺民盟领袖行动自由后，据蒋匪中央社南京二十七日电，蒋匪政府内政部已于二十七日悍然宣布民盟为“非法团体”。此一和平的民主政党正式被宣布为“非法”，标志着日暮途穷的蒋匪何等恐慌，何等孤立，何等疯狂，此举不啻宣告蒋介石匪帮的最后政治破产。按自政协会议以来，备受蒋介石匪帮迫害的民盟，从未在蒋介石统治下取得真正的合法地位，政协会议迄最近，民盟中委被蒋匪屠杀者有李公朴、闻一多、杜斌丞，被毒打者有民盟主席张澜、李公朴（后被蒋匪特务枪杀），中委被捕者有范朴齐、张志和、杨伯恺，中委以下的干部及盟员被杀被捕者已多至不可胜数。至于民盟的宣传机关，如重庆的民主报、民主星期刊，昆明、北平两地的民主周刊，成都的华西晚报，西安的工商、秦风报联合版等，则早已被蒋匪全部封闭。蒋匪这些血腥暴行，说明了民盟在被宣布为“非法”前早已备受摧残，毫无活动余地。目前蒋匪宣布民盟为“非法”，则更将其法西斯匪帮狰狞真面目完全暴露于世。
    【新华社陕北三十日电】合众社沪二十八日讯：蒋匪内政部宣布民盟为“非法团体”后，民盟主席张澜表示民盟反对伪宪争取民主的立场不变。张氏强调称：“我们一贯的忠实实现政协决议及成立真正的联合政府的和平民主政策仍未改变。”张氏谴责蒋匪此举为绞杀民盟的绳索的最后一着，并妄图以此强迫民盟参加蒋匪反人民内战及承认伪宪后宣称：“民盟希望中国民主和平，但对宪法问题则经常采取保留态度，因（蒋匪）国大通过之宪法并非严格依照政协方针。”据合众与法新社二十九日消息称，张澜预料民盟盟员将有大量被捕，并表示他已下令民盟暂时停止活动，但民盟海外支部可不受限制。
