    Yin Xuemei Group Leads the Way in Carrying Out Spinning Campaign in Shangyu
    [This newspaper, Xiangyuan News] Under the promotion of the Yin Xuemei group, Shangyu Village in the First District has launched its second hundred-day spinning campaign. Her group of ten people initially only pursued quantity, each completing nine *jin* [approximately 4.5 kilograms], resulting in a disregard for the quality of the yarn, and some people became unenthusiastic. Zhang Yutang said: "I think we haven't made any progress; it's better to spin on our own without mutual aid!" After discovering these problems, they convened a group meeting to establish a plan: spinning four *liang* [approximately 200 grams] of yarn or weaving six *chi* [approximately 2 meters] of cloth would be graded with labor points: first-class, eleven points; second-class, ten points; third-class, nine points. After this plan was set, it inspired everyone's enthusiasm. Those who were half-skilled became fully skilled, and those who were unskilled became half-skilled. The quality improved greatly, and the group also expanded significantly. For ease of leadership, Xuemei divided the group into three smaller groups, with the larger group leading the smaller groups in their work. To promote the acceleration of spinning wheels and hand-pulled looms, it was proposed that those who spun four *liang* of yarn on an accelerated wheel or wove six *chi* of cloth on a hand-pulled loom would receive the following labor points: first-class, twelve points; second-class, eleven points; third-class, ten points. As a result, her group now has twelve accelerated spinning wheels and two hand-pulled looms, and everyone is taking turns to learn how to use them. A summary before the autumn harvest showed that they exceeded the original plan. They are all very motivated and became a shock team for the autumn harvest. Now, another plan has been set: this winter, everyone should learn to use the substitute spinning wheel, and two-thirds of the group should learn to use the hand-pulled loom. Under the influence of her group, all twenty-one groups in the village are learning from Yin Xuemei. The second hundred-day spinning campaign is now underway.

    尹雪梅组带头上峪开展纺运
    【本报襄垣讯】一区上峪村在尹雪梅组推动下，开展了第二个百日纺织运动。她组十个人，开始只求数量，每人完成九斤，这样好赖线不分，有些人很不起劲。张玉棠说：我看咱们没有一些进步，还不如不互助自己纺吧！在发现以上问题以后，便召开全组会议，订出计划，纺四两或织六尺布为十分（工票）一等十一分，二等十分，三等的九分。经这样一定计划，启发了大家的热情，半把式升成全把式，不会的升成半把式，质量大大提高。组也扩大的多了。为了领导便利，雪梅即又分成三个小组，大组领导小组做活。为了推广加速轮车和手拉梭机，又提出：用加速车上纺线四两或手拉梭机织布六尺者，即为头等十二分（工票）、二等十一分、三等十分，这样一来，她组现发展有加速轮车十二架，手拉梭机二架，大家轮流学，秋前总结，超过原计划。她们大家很有劲，秋收时就成为突击秋收队。现在又订出计划：今冬每人要学会代轮车，组内三分之二人要学会手拉梭机，在她组的影响下，全村二十一组，都向尹雪梅学习。现正开展第二个百日纺织。（玉亭、中保、同则、旺志、正南）
