　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 9th. The Jin Sui Military Region Headquarters has announced the results of the Jixian and Xiangning campaign: a total of 1,270 people, including the Jixian County Chief Li Wenyi and Acting County Chief Zu Zhihong, were captured, and more than 140 enemies were killed or wounded.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jin Cha Ji, 11th. On the 30th of last month, Shi Bingyin, a combat hero of the Xushui Militia, led more than 30 militiamen to set up an ambush at Jingtangpu, more than ten miles south of Xushui City. At 2 PM, thirteen Chiang Kai-shek bandit vehicles fully loaded with cloth and flour came from the north. As they entered the ambush circle, the militia immediately pounced on the vehicles. After an hour of fierce fighting, except for two enemy vehicles that managed to escape, the remaining eleven vehicles were all captured by us. Two of them have been destroyed, and nine are intact and have all been driven into the Liberated Area.
