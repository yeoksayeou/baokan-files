	Spinning, Weaving, and Looming
	Zhuli and Other Villages Produce to Survive the Famine

[Our Newspaper, Zanhuang News] After completing the autumn harvest and wheat planting, Nanyan Village, Xizhuli, and Nanzhuli villages in the Fourth District, with the support of loans from the democratic government, began to roll and gin cotton, and launched textile production. The masses, through voluntary association, launched a joint production movement. In Xizhuli Village, free partnerships formed four groups, with sixteen households pooling 100,000 yuan of idle funds and borrowing 140,000 yuan to carry cotton back from Gaoyi Yuanshi, supplying small cooperative’s ginning machines and wind bows. The ginned cotton was then supplied to the women of the village for spinning and weaving. In just twenty-one days, they earned 200,000 yuan. During production, the masses spontaneously proposed "As long as the wind bows and ginning machines turn, Xizhuli will not lack food," and when the masses heard the sound of the wind bow, they sang, "As long as the wind bows and ginning machines sound, Xizhuli will not lack grain." The slogan of the people is "Winter production is busy, next year will be a good year to survive the famine." In Nanzhuli, men formed four partnership groups and women formed seven partnership groups, pooling 54,000 yuan of idle funds and borrowing 190,000 yuan. In less than a month, they earned more than 224,000 yuan and also collected and stored more than 1,000 jin of flower seeds. For example, Liu Xi's women, two people earned 7,000 yuan from weaving cloth within five days. In these spontaneous partnership production efforts, the masses formulated their own methods of dividing labor between agriculture and commerce. Those who went out to run errands earned two work points per day, eating from the public pot. Those who stayed at home to work for those who went out earned one work point per day, and cultivating one mu of land earned two work points. In this way, they did not interfere with each other and were all satisfied. The division of labor was tightly organized, ensuring that there was carrying, ginning, looming, spinning, weaving, selling, and earning. Fan Ximei, the director of the Women's Federation of Nanyan Village, in order to lead production, led five women to collectively dig a cellar and weave together in one place. Now the profits earned by each group have exceeded the original capital. (Liu Kuan)

  　竹里等村生产度荒
    【本报赞皇讯】四区南延庄、西竹里、南竹里等村在完成收秋种麦之后，在民主政府贷款的扶助下，开始轧弹棉花，开展纺织。群众在自愿的结合下，展开合伙生产运动。西竹里村自由合伙成了四个组，十六户集游资十万元，贷款十四万元，从高邑元氏往回担棉花，供给小型社的轧车风弓用，轧弹出来棉花，又供给本村的妇女纺织。仅二十一天，就赚洋廿万元。在生产中，群众自动提出“只要风弓轧车转，不缺西竹吃的饭”，群众一听到风弓响就唱着“只要风弓轧车响，不缺咱西竹吃的粮”，大家的口号是“冬季生产忙，明年好渡荒。”南竹里男子合伙成了四个组，妇女合伙七个组，集游资五万四千元，贷款十九万元，不到一个月，就赚了二十二万四千余元，还集存了花籽一千多斤。如妇女刘西的，两个人在五天之内，织布赚洋七千元。群众在这些自发的合伙生产中，自订农商分工办法，跑外的每天顶两个工，吃到公伙。在家的给跑外的干一天营生，顶一个工，耕一亩地顶两个工。这样互不耽误，都很满意。分工组织紧密，保证有担、有轧、有弹、有纺、有织、有卖、有赚。南延庄妇救会主任范喜妹，为了领导生产，带领了五个妇女集体打了一个窨子，在一块纺织。现在各组所赚的利润，都已超过原本。（刘宽）
