　　Yangjingdi Poor and Hired Peasants Take Power
　　Women Actively Plow Autumn Fields
　　[Report from this newspaper, Ping Shun] After the rectification of mutual aid in Yangjingdi, Fifth District, the poor and hired peasants, both men and women, took power. Mutual aid groups were reorganized into nineteen groups, and women's weaving groups were reorganized into fifteen teams. The group leaders and team leaders were all poor and hired peasants. Guo Li, who was elected team leader, said happily: "We didn't expect that we thought we couldn't do without others. Now, if we don't do it, who will?" She then mobilized and organized women from various groups to participate in autumn plowing and land cultivation after completing the autumn harvest. Under the leadership of the poor and hired peasants, the wheat fields were expanded. Zhang Ze said: "I have never planted so much wheat before. If you hadn't solved the problem of fertilizer for me, how could I have planted so much wheat!" Wu Houli said: "In the past, the group leaders were all controlled by others. It was impossible to urge them to do anything. If you forced them, they would just cope. They had livestock and would do their own work first. Only after they finished their own work would they come out to do public work. Poor and hired peasants without livestock suffered losses." After the poor and hired peasants took power, the work in the whole village took on a new look. Now, the first plowing of the autumn fields has been completed, and the second plowing of the autumn fields has begun. All the male able-bodied laborers, in addition to carrying fertilizer to the fields, are pulling plows themselves. (Jiang Wen)

　　羊井底贫雇掌权
  　妇女积极秋垡地
    【本报平顺讯】五区羊井底整顿互助后，男女贫雇当了权，互助组整顿成十九个，妇女纺织组整顿成为一十五个队，组长队长都是贫雇，郭理女当选了队长，高兴的说：“咱没有想到光以为离了人家不行，现在咱不干叫谁干？”他就动员组织起各组妇女，完成秋收后又参加了秋垡地盘茬。在贫雇带头下扩大了麦田，掌则说：“我就没有多种过麦，要不是给我解决肥料的困难，我那里能种这样多麦！”吴候利说：“从前各组组长都是人家掌握，干什么事情都督促不动，你强说人家便是应付，人家有牲口，先干人家自己的，干消停了才出来干，刚赶上贫雇没有牲口户吃了亏。”贫雇当权后，全村工作成了新的面貌，现秋垡一遍地完成，转入秋垡二遍地，男全劳力除了往地担肥，都进行人拉犁。（讲文）
