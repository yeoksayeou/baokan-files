　　Combining Agriculture and Sideline Occupations with Intensive Farming
  　Yuan Village Achieves "One Unit Harvested, One Unit Surplus"
    [Report from Taiyue, 21st of this month] The liberated farmers of Yuan Village, Tunliu County, have become prosperous in the past year by relying on organization and intensive farming, achieving a situation of "one unit harvested, one unit surplus." In the past, under the exploitation of seventeen feudal landlords and despots such as Jin and Yan, the farmers, who constituted nine-tenths of the village, owned only three-quarters of the village's land. As a result, they could not eat their fill even after working hard all year round, and two-tenths of them had nothing to eat just after the autumn harvest was completed. This year, after the land was returned to the farmers, their enthusiasm for production has been particularly high. Ninety percent of the full and semi-labor force in the village have organized themselves and engaged in agricultural and sideline production. All 4,651 mu of land have been intensively cultivated, with an average of 60 loads of manure applied per mu, plowed twice and hoed twice. Eighteen qing of land were even hoed three times, and 65 mu were irrigated during droughts, resulting in a significant increase in yields. For example, the liberated farmer Sun Wenxiang used to get a yield of 1.2 shi per mu on his 7.5 mu of land. Because he plowed twice, harrowed four times, hoed three times, and irrigated three mu during the drought, the actual yield this autumn was 2.5 shi per mu, more than double the previous yield. In total, the village should have produced 3,450 dan of coarse grain, but this autumn's actual harvest was 5,626 shi and 9.7 dou, an increase of 2,071 shi and 9.7 dou, equivalent to 1,035 shi and 9.8 dou of millet. In addition, they also seized the slack season to engage in spinning, weaving, and transportation. The village's 314 spinning wheels and 98 shuttle looms spun a total of 1,744 jin of yarn before October, earning 147 shi and 4 dou of rice, and wove 2,969 bolts of cloth, earning 240 shi of rice. From March to September, transportation earned a profit of 5,378,000 yuan, equivalent to 420 shi of millet. In addition, 493 pigs were sold, earning 384 shi and 4 dou of rice, and 962 chickens were raised, earning 24 shi of rice. Before August, the cooperative had a net profit of 409,800 yuan, equivalent to 43 shi and 8.8 dou of rice. In total, sideline production increased by 1,282 shi and 7.8 dou of millet. The total increase in agricultural and sideline production was 2,318 shi, 7 dou, and 6.5 he of millet. The village has 227 households, with an average increase of 10 shi and 2 dou per household. Gao Yunting cultivated 45 mu of land, and his expected yield was 36 shi and 5 dou, but because of intensive cultivation, he actually harvested 66 shi and 3 dou. In addition, he earned 190,000 yuan from transportation, wove 45 bolts of cloth, and spun 52.5 jin of cotton, with a total increase in agricultural and sideline production equivalent to 90 shi and 4 dou of coarse grain. Sun Wenxiang, who used to be a dirt-poor farmer with no house or land, had an income from agricultural and sideline production this year equivalent to 27 shi and 2 dou of millet. He earned 100,000 yuan from spinning, weaving, and transportation, and 200,600 yuan from selling 11 pigs, for a total equivalent of 50 shi and 7 dou of millet. For his family of five, after deducting food, clothing, and other expenses for the year, he still had a surplus of 25 shi and 7.5 dou, achieving "one unit harvested, one unit surplus." Liberated farmers such as Cao Qide and Huo Lubao, who had never worn cotton pants at the age of thirty-five, have also achieved "one unit harvested, one unit surplus." Currently, the village has 244 pigs and 962 chickens, with almost every family owning a pig and everyone owning a chicken. The villagers have also purchased a large number of livestock, with 25 mules, and 48 horses, donkeys, and cattle, a threefold increase in livestock compared to three years ago.

　　农副结合精耕细作
  　原村达到耕一余一
    【本报太岳二十一日电】屯留原村翻身农民，一年来依靠组织起来，精耕细作等，已由穷变富，耕一余一。该村过去在金、阎等十七户封建地主恶霸的剥削下，占全村十分之九的农民，却只有全村土地四分之三，因此，劳动全年不得饱暖，其中十分之二，在刚收完秋就没吃的。今年土地回家后，农民生产情绪特别高涨，全村全半劳力百分之九十组织起来，投入农副业生产，四千六百五十一亩土地，皆进行了精耕细作，每亩地平均上粪六十担，普犁两遍、锄两遍，其中有十八顷地还锄了三遍，天旱时浇地六十五亩，因此产量大大增加。例如翻身农民孙文祥，往常产量一石二斗的七亩半地，因犁两遍、耙四遍、锄三遍，天旱并以水浇三亩，今秋每亩实产量二石五斗，增产一倍以上。总计全村应产三千四百五十担粗粮，而今秋实收五千六百二十六石九斗七升，增产两千零七十一石九斗七升，折合小米一千零三十五石九斗八升。此外，还抓紧农闲进行纺织、运输，全村三百一十四辆纺车、九十八架拉梭机，十月前共纺线一千七百四十四斤，赚米一百四十七石四斗，织布二千九百六十九匹，赚米二百四十石；从三月至九月，运输赚利五百三十七万八千元，折合小米四百二十石。再加上卖猪四百九十三口，赚米三百八十四石四斗。养鸡九百六十二只，赚米二十四石。合作社八月前，净获利四十万九千八百元，合米四十三石八斗八升。共计副业增产一千二百八十二石七斗八升小米。总共农副业增产小米二千三百一十八石七斗六升五合。全村二百二十七户，每户平均增产十石二斗。该村高云亭种地四十五亩，应产量三十六石五斗，但他因精耕细作，实收六十六石三斗，再加上运输赚利十九万元，织布四十五匹、纺花五十二斤半，总共农副业增产合粗粮九十石零四斗。过去曾是房无一间地无一垅的赤贫孙文祥，今年农副业收入，合小米二十七石二斗，纺织、运输赚利十万元，卖猪十一口赚利二十万零六千元，总共合小米五十石零七斗。他家五口人，全年除吃穿负担外，尚余二十五石七斗五升，耕一余一。三十五岁没有穿过棉裤的曹祺德、霍陆保等翻身农民，亦都达到了耕一余一。现全村共有猪二百四十四口、鸡九百六十二只，差不多家家有猪，人人有鸡，全村群众又大量买进牲口，已有骡子二十五头，马、驴、牛四十八头，较三年前增加牲口三倍。
