　　US Controls Chiang Kai-shek's Army Institutions
　　Plotting to Seize New Bases Through Training
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 21st. U.S. imperialism is making a desperate struggle for the collapse of Chiang Kai-shek's regime by assisting Chiang Kai-shek's authorities in training Chiang's army, and is further controlling Chiang Kai-shek's army training institutions and seizing new military strategic bases. According to a report by the Associated Press, the training of a division of Chiang's army in Taiwan is being assisted by the first group of U.S. advisory group officers entering Taiwan, and more advisory group officials will arrive in Taiwan before the end of the month. News from Nanjing newspapers said that, in addition to Taiwan, Chiang Kai-shek's authorities have also determined Nanjing, Hankou, Chengdu, Nanyue (near Hengshan), and Shaoguan (northern Guangdong) as training centers. Rooks, head of the U.S. advisory group, accompanied senior officials of Chiang Kai-shek's "Ministry of National Defense" to Hankou on the 18th to inspect the Chiang Kai-shek's Army University, which was recently moved to Hankou and reorganized according to the U.S. plan. The Associated Press claimed that Rooks' trip "is related to the expanded training plan of the U.S. advisory group." Not long ago, Chiang Kai-shek's "Hankou Peace Daily" published that the Army University had obtained Chiang Kai-shek's permission to establish officer training classes in Taiwan, Shenyang, Beiping, and Xi'an to expand its training plan. It is reported that the selection of all these training locations is closely coordinated with the U.S. plan to establish a base network in China. The Associated Press revealed that the U.S. government, based on its interests in assisting Chiang Kai-shek in invading China, has approved the U.S. military advisory group to expand its scope of work in China from training Chiang Kai-shek's military technical logistics personnel to directly training Chiang's army. The U.S. advisory group's external liaison office also admitted that it had been "ordered" to include Chiang Kai-shek's army institutions "into the activities of the advisory group."

　　美控制蒋匪陆军机构
  　图借训练攫取新基地
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】美帝国主义正借协助蒋匪当局训练蒋军，为蒋匪的崩溃作绝望的挣扎，并进一步控制蒋匪陆军训练机构与攫取新的军事战略基地。据合众社消息，在台湾对蒋军一个师的训练工作已由进入台湾的第一批美顾问团军官协助进行中，月底以前且将有更多顾问团官员抵达台湾。南京报纸消息称，除台湾外，蒋匪当局且已确定以南京、汉口、成都、南狱（衡山附近）、韶关（粤北）等地为训练中心。美顾问团长鲁克斯于十八日伴同蒋匪国防部高级官员同赴汉口，视察最近移往汉口按照美国计划改组之蒋匪陆军大学，合众社称鲁此行“与美顾问团之扩大训练计划有关”。前不久蒋匪汉口“和平日报”曾载：陆军大学已得蒋介石允许在台湾、沈阳、北平、西安四地设立军官训练班，以扩大其训练计划。据悉，所有这些训练地点的选择，皆与美国建立在华基地网的计划密切配合。合众社消息透露，美政府基于援蒋侵华利益，已批准美军顾问团将其在华工作范围，由训练蒋匪军事技术后勤人员扩展为直接训练蒋军工作，美顾问团对外联络处亦承认已“奉命”将蒋匪陆军机构“包括入顾问团的活动中”。
