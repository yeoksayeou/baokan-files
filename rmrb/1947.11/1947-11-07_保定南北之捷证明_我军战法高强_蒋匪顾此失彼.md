    Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀 (Jinchaji) 5th Dispatch: Our branch reporter commented on the great victories north and south of Baoding, stating: These victories directly coordinated with the Northeast Autumn Offensive, forming a pincer attack on Chiang Kai-shek's 平津保 (Pingjinbao – Beijing, Tianjin, Baoding) area together with the Northeast Democratic Allied Army sweeping the Beining Railway line. Moreover, our army's large-scale annihilation of the enemy on the inner lines echoes the victories of the various armies conducting outer line operations southward. After the destruction of Chiang Kai-shek's main force, the Third Army, the isolated city of 石家庄 (Shijiazhuang) is even more precarious. Chiang Kai-shek's entire defense has also become more passive, with 平津保 (Pingjinbao – Beijing, Tianjin, Baoding) constantly under the threat of our counter-attacking forces. Our army, on the other hand, is increasingly mobile and can freely choose targets for powerful strikes. From now on, the possibility of Chiang Kai-shek organizing any "campaign offensives" on the border region battlefield has been greatly reduced. What the enemy is busy with now is not "offense" but "defense."
    This campaign was an organic combination of large-scale blocking operations and large-scale annihilation battles, realizing the operational policy of not letting a single enemy escape in the annihilation battle, and not easily retreating a single step in the blocking battle. The fifteen regiments of Chiang's troops urgently moving south from Baoding to reinforce, despite being covered by tanks and aircraft, were fearful and unwilling to advance under our bayonet charges, advancing less than forty *li* in four days.
    The large-scale annihilation of Chiang Kai-shek's active forces has caused Li Zongren and Sun Lianzhong, who were already feeling the lack of troops, even greater headaches. As soon as our army's offensive edge was revealed, Chiang Kai-shek's deployment became chaotic, rushing east, west, north, and south, neglecting the Daqing River defense line and urgently transferring the Sixteenth Army westward for reinforcement. The Twenty-second Division, which had just been transferred to the Beining Railway line for defense, was also hurriedly withdrawn to the Pinghan front line. Even in the most urgent moments, they even hastily transferred some scattered troops from the Beining Railway. But the Third Army, which ventured north on the orders of the bandit Chiang, could not avoid the fate of being completely annihilated, truly "robbing Peter to pay Paul," and "living from hand to mouth." The Qingfengdian victory proves that our Jin察冀 (Jinchaji) Liberation Army is becoming stronger and stronger in battle. Based on this victory, our army will have full confidence in fighting more and greater victories, cooperating with armies across the country to completely annihilate the enemies around the border region.

    Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀 (Jinchaji) 5th Dispatch: The Jin察冀 (Jinchaji) Front Headquarters has just issued Communique No. 4, announcing the combined results of the Qingfengdian and Baoding North battles from October 10th to 22nd. A total of 17,253 Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers were killed, wounded, or captured, including 6,155 killed or wounded, and 11,098 captured, including the Third Army Commander Luo Lireong, Deputy Army Commander Yang Guangyu, and the Seventh Division Commander Li Yongzhang and other officers and soldiers. The captured materials include 72 mountain guns, infantry guns, anti-tank guns, mortars, rocket launchers, and 60mm mortars, four flamethrowers, three tanks, 489 light and heavy machine guns, 113 grenade launchers, 58 rifle grenades, 4,338 rifles and carbines, 174 submachine guns, 1,087 artillery shells, 200,492 rounds of ammunition, 18 radios, five vehicles, two aircraft shot down, and 34 enemy bunkers destroyed.

### 保定南北之捷证明  我军战法高强  蒋匪顾此失彼

    保定南北之捷证明
    我军战法高强
    蒋匪顾此失彼
    【新华社晋察冀五日电】分社记者评保定南北大捷称：此次大捷直接配合了东北秋季攻势，与横扫北宁线之东北民主联军，形成对蒋匪平津保之夹击形势。而我军在内线大量歼敌，又与南下进行外线作战各路大军之胜利交相辉映。蒋匪主力第三军覆没后，孤岛之石家庄已更形摇摇欲坠。蒋匪整个防御亦更陷于被动，平津保随时处于我反攻大军威胁之下。而我军则益形机动，可以任意的选择目标予以有力打击。从此蒋匪再想在边区战场组织什么“战役进攻”的可能性已大大减少，现在敌人忙着的已经不是什么“进攻”，而是忙着“防御”了。
    此次战役，是大规模阻击战与大规模歼灭战有机结合，实现了歼灭战不随便放跑一个敌人，阻击战不轻易退后一步的作战方针，保北急切南下增援之匪军十五个团兵力，虽以坦克飞机掩护，在我白刃冲杀下，畏缩不前，四天前进不足四十华里。
    蒋匪有生力量的大量被歼，使早已感到兵力不足的李宗仁、孙连仲更大伤脑筋。此次我军攻势锋芒初露，蒋匪部署即形错乱，东西南北疲于奔命，不顾大清河防线，星夜将十六军西调增援，二十二师刚刚调至北宁线守备，又匆匆抽回平汉前线，甚至到最紧急时，还把北宁路上的一点部队也零零星星的赶调过来。但奉蒋贼命令冒险北窜的第三军仍免不了全军覆没的命运，真是“挖肉补疮”，“捉襟见肘”。清风店大捷，证明我晋察冀解放军越战越强，在这一胜利基础上，我军将有充分信心打更多更大的胜仗，配合全国各路大军全部歼灭边区周围的敌人。
    【新华社晋察冀五日电】晋察冀前线司令部顷发表第四号公报，公布自十月十日至二十二日清风店及保北两战役之综合战果，总计毙伤俘蒋匪官兵一万七千二百五十三人，内毙伤六千一百五十五人，生俘第三军军长罗历戎、副军长杨光钰，及该军第七师师长李用章以下官兵一万一千零九十八人，缴获山炮、步兵炮、平射炮、迫击炮、火箭炮、六○炮共七十二门，火焰喷射器四个，坦克三辆，轻重机枪四百八十九挺，掷弹筒一百一十三个，枪榴筒五十八个，长短枪四千三百三十八支，冲锋枪一百七十四支，炮弹一千零八十七发，子弹二十万零四千九百二十三发，电台十八部，汽车五辆，击落飞机二架，毁灭敌碉堡三十四座。
