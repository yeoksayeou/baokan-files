Iron Joint Defense

The vast number of liberated peasants in the Heze-Kaocheng guerrilla area of Henan have built an iron joint defense to protect their land and lives. Now, on the east side of the He(ze)-Kao(cheng) highway, from the Gengsheng District of Heze in the north to the Fifth District of Kaocheng in the south, a large number of peasants in more than two hundred villages, after having been allotted land, have actively armed themselves to protect their land and lives, and have established a solid joint defense, compressing the enemy into the highway line and isolated strongholds. When Li Lou in the Third District of Shijun District, Qibin County, was in the process of distributing movable property, the enemy's plainclothes team came immediately. The young people took up their spears and ran to the west end, saying to the comrades in the district: "Even if we kowtow to you, you must give us two guns." The district gave them a few, and later they found some grenades in the landlord's house, so they armed themselves to guard their homes. Due to the victory of the armed struggle in Wang Xin Zhuang and Li Lou, the peasants in each village were told that only through struggle can they survive. Therefore, joint defense was launched in the whole village, and more than twenty capable militiamen were transferred from the whole township to form a mobile joint defense team to support the struggles of various villages. The joint defense team often moved on the front line of the struggle. As soon as the gun sounded, the villagers' militia would automatically run to reinforce them. On the first day of the establishment of the joint defense, the enemy came to Li Lou to loot grain, but as soon as they reached Tunli (two miles west of Li Lou), they were driven away by the joint defense. In just half a month, they fought four battles, and each time they drove the enemy away. In the battle of Beiting Temple, four enemies were wounded, and the enemy never came to the village. Sometimes they advanced into a township in the northwest to support neighboring districts. The militiamen of Li Lou village, in order to prevent the enemy from encircling them at night, would go out in the afternoon and evening to wait in ambush for the enemy. With the support of the joint defense and the militia, the Third Township launched a second review and set off a peasant revenge movement. The masses of Wang Huayuan and Houjia automatically punished the local tyrants and enemy landlords, and other landlords did not dare to speak casually on the street. The militiamen of the four villages of Shizhuang in the Fourth Township were established, not only guarding their own villages, but also covering the land distribution of five villages including Hou Gutang, pushing the joint defense line one step further. Once, eleven people from the puppet Bai Mao Township Office went from San Zhangjia to Da Xiezhai to loot grain. Under the leadership of Comrade Yu Jingfa, the militiamen of these villages repelled the enemy, killing two and wounding seven. After the militiamen of Caolou in the Third District took up their guns, Shagang and other villages were also brought along, forming a joint defense zone. Once the enemy entered west of Caolou, the militiamen cooperated with the armed work team to drive the enemy to Dalou, killing one enemy and wounding three. After several battles, the morale of the militiamen was even higher. They often patrolled five or six miles away, day and night. As soon as the enemy heard the gunshots, they would run away, and the militiamen were more and more energetic in chasing them.

The entire Gengsheng District of Heze is a hidden guerrilla area. The guerrilla groups organized by village cadres who have left production have developed into armed village offices. They fight when the enemy comes, leave if they can't win, and return to the village to work, suppress bad guys, distribute land, and crack down on the enemy's looting of grain and conscription. These many joint defense zones are linked together, forming a strong iron wall. When the crops are ripe, they are armed to cover the autumn harvest. For example, when Wang Xinzhuang and Li Lou went to the field to harvest, the militiamen were on sentry duty in front, the young and middle-aged men with grenades in their belts were harvesting in the second line, and the old, weak, women and children were around the village. Under armed cover, not a single grain was lost and not a single piece of land was left uncultivated. They said: "If it weren't for these guns, our village would have been impossible to manage." The masses automatically collected the land tax for the militiamen on sentry duty, and when the joint defense team and the militiamen ran out of bullets, the masses automatically collected money to supply them. They said: "How much money can you use in a year? How much is a calf worth!" Now, in this area, fighting has become their way of life. They put grenades on their carts when they go to the market.

The struggle of holding a gun in one hand and a grenade in the other for the past six months in this area has the following experiences: (1) When the land reform movement just started, our leaders strongly supported the masses, reducing the masses' concerns and breaking face with the enemy. Armed self-defense is the universal and urgent demand of the masses. We must solve this demand of the masses. If there are guns in storage, they can be distributed to the masses. Only in this way can the land reform movement be carried out more quickly. However, the thinking of some of our cadres lags behind the development of the masses' thinking. They say that if guns are given to the masses, the masses will not be able to protect them. This argument is distrustful of the masses and does not believe that the masses have the ability to defeat the enemy. The existence of this kind of thinking has caused some of our villages to be attacked by the enemy. In the actual development of the movement, it has been proved that this kind of thinking is completely wrong. The masses said it well: "If you don't do it, when the enemy comes and takes away two calves, it will be enough to buy a gun." (2) The more widespread and in-depth the land reform is carried out, the higher the masses' demand for armed self-defense and the more courageous the fighting, that is to say, the faster the mass guerrilla warfare develops. This is the general law of the movement in many villages. This question profoundly illustrates that without land reform and without the liberation of the broad masses, it is difficult to imagine the development of mass guerrilla warfare. On the contrary, guerrilla warfare combined with land and combined with reversing the liquidation, guerrilla warfare will develop fiercely and emerge with infinite power. This is the key to carrying out guerrilla warfare. After the mass guerrilla warfare has been carried out, it has vigorously supported the land reform movement, making the land reform movement more widespread and in-depth. Mass guerrilla warfare and land reform are so closely linked. (3) In the border areas, the liberated peasants in each village established militiamen and model classes, took up arms to guard their homes and protect their land, and have since gained a foothold, fighting the local bullies so that they dare not come to rob, and further supporting the distribution of land and movable property. However, bandits such as local bullies are constantly trying to launch surprise attacks and enter our villages to loot, kill, arrest, and fine. Therefore, there are many battles. They can't be idle for three days before fighting. Under such circumstances, the masses in each village feel that it is better for many villages to unite and fight the enemy together than for each village to guard their homes and defend themselves alone. Therefore, joint defense teams were established in each township, and nearly a hundred villages formed a deep fighting line against the enemies of the Heze-Kaocheng line, and the mass guerrilla warfare was raised to a higher level. Mass guerrilla warfare has developed from guarding homes and protecting land in each village to joint defense. This is a gradual development process. If we propose the establishment of joint defense too early, the masses will not easily accept it, and it will be harmful to the struggle against the enemy; but if we propose the establishment of joint defense too late, the masses will easily suffer from the enemy's attacks. We must, according to the actual situation of mass guerrilla warfare, timely propose the urgent questions of the masses, so that mass guerrilla warfare can be continuously improved.

### 铁的联防

    铁的联防
    我河南游击区菏（泽）考（城）广大翻身农民，筑成铁的联防，保田、保命。现菏（泽）考（城）公路东侧，北起菏泽更生区，南至考城五区，在长约五十余里包括二百余村庄的广大农民分得土地后，已为保田、保命而积极武装起来，建立了坚固的联防，将敌人压缩到公路线和孤立据点里。齐滨县石钧区三区李楼，正在搞浮财的时候，敌人的便衣队便马上来啦，年青人都拿着杆子跑到西头，对区的同志说：“就是给您磕头，您也得给俺两棵枪。”区里给了他们几枝，后来又在地主家翻出几个手榴弹，于是就武装看起家来。由于王新庄、李楼武装斗争的胜利，告诉了各村农民：只有斗争，才能生存，于是在全村搞起了联防，在全小区里就调出二十余名精干的民兵，组织一支机动作战的联防队，支持各村的斗争。联防队经常游动在斗争的最前线，只要枪一响，各村民兵便自动的跑去增援。联防刚成立第一天，敌人即出动到李楼一带抢粮，但刚走到屯里（李楼西二里），就被联防打跑了。不过半个月打了四次仗，每次都把敌人赶跑了。北亭寺一战，曾打伤敌人四名，敌人始终没有到村上。有时他们挺进到西北方向的一小区里，为邻区撑腰。李楼村的民兵为了预防敌人的夜间包围，每到下午夜里便出去等着打敌人的伏击。在联防和民兵的支持下，三小区搞起了二次复查，掀起了农民的复仇运动。王花园、侯家群众，自动惩办恶霸地主和敌人，其他地主不敢在街上随便说话。四小区市庄等四个村的民兵成立起来，不仅在自己村上站岗看家，而且掩护了后古堂等五个村的分地，将联防线往外推进了一步。一次伪白冒镇公所十一个人从三张家到大谢砦抢粮，这几个村的民兵在于景发同志的领导下，将敌人击退，打死两名、打伤七名。在三区曹楼的民兵拿起枪来后，沙岗等村也带起来了，组成了一个联防区，一次敌人进到曹楼西，民兵配合武工队将敌赶到大楼，打死敌人一名、伤三名。经过几次战斗之后，民兵情绪更高了。黑夜、白天他们经常放哨到五、六里路以外，敌人一听见枪响就跑，民兵越撵越有劲。
    菏泽更生区整个都是隐蔽的游击区，由脱离生产的村干组织起来的游击小组，发展到武装村公所，敌人来了就打，打不过就走，敌人走了再回村办公，镇压坏蛋，进行分地，打击敌人抢粮、抓丁。这许多联防区连串到一起，形成了一道雄厚的铁墙。庄稼熟了，武装掩护秋收，如王新庄、李楼下地收割时，民兵在前面放哨，青壮年腰里插着手榴弹，在二线收割，老弱妇孺在村子周围，在武装的掩护下，没丢一颗粗粮，没荒一分地。他们说：“要不是这些枪，咱村早就没法治啦。”群众自动的将放哨民兵的地代收起来，联防队和民兵没子弹了，群众都自动敛钱供给，他们说：“打一年能用多少钱呢？拉走一个牛值多少！”现在这一带的农民，战斗已成了他们的生活习惯，他们在赶集时的车子上，都放着手榴弹。
    该地半年来一手拿枪一手拿手榴弹的斗争，有如下几点经验：（一）当土改运动刚开始，我们领导上给群众大力撑腰，群众的顾虑减少了，和敌人撕破了脸。武装自卫，这是群众普遍的迫切要求，我们必须解决群众这一要求，如有存枪可发给群众，只有如此，才能使土改运动更快的开展起来。但是我们个别干部的思想落后于群众的思想发展，说给群众枪，群众保护不住，这种论调，是不相信群众，不相信群众有能力战胜敌人。这种思想的存在，曾使我们个别村庄遭受到敌人的打击。在实际运动的发展中，证明这种思想是完全错误的。群众说得好：“你要不干，敌人来了，牵走两个小牛，就顶买一杆枪”。（二）土地改革进行的愈普遍深入，群众武装自卫的要求越高，战斗更加英勇，也就是说，群众性的游击战争开展得更快，这是许多村庄运动的普遍规律。这一问题深切的说明了，没有土地改革、没有广大群众的翻身，群众性游击战争的开展是很难想象的。相反的，游击战争与土地结合起来与反倒算结合起来，游击战争便猛烈的开展起来，涌现无限的力量，这是开展游击战争的关键。群众游击战争开展起来后，又有力的支持了土地改革运动，使土改运动进行得更普遍深入。群众游击战争和土改是这样的相互密切结合着。（三）在边沿区，各村翻身农民，成立了民兵和模范班，拿起了武器看家保田，从此站住了脚，打得土顽不敢来抢劫，并进一步支持了分田、分浮财。但是土顽等匪徒们无时无刻不在想突击，打进我们这些村庄，进行抢掠、杀人、抓人、罚款，因此战斗是很多的，闲不了三天就打仗，在这样的情形下，各村群众感到各个村单独看家自卫，不如许多村庄联合起来大家共同打敌人，于是各小区成立了联防队，近百个村庄对菏、考线敌人形成了一道纵深的斗争防线，群众游击战争更提高了一步。群众游击战争由各个村的看家保田，发展到联防，这是一个逐渐发展过程，如果我们过早的提出成立联防，群众不易接受，而且有害于对敌斗争；但如过晚的提出联防，群众容易遭受敌人打击。我们必须根据群众游击战争的实际情况，适时的提出群众迫切的问题，使群众游击战争不断的提高。（冀鲁豫分社）
