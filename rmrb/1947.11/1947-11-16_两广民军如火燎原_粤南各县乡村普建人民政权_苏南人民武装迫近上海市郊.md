Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: "The flames of war in the South have become a prairie fire," is how the Tianjin Dagongbao, in a special dispatch from Guangzhou on October 30th, described the people's armed forces active in Guangdong and Guangxi. According to the dispatch, in late October, the people's armed forces in Guangdong Province engaged in fierce battles with the Chiang bandits. The battles took place simultaneously in Haikang, Zhanjiang, Wuchuan, Hua County, Suixi, Fangcheng, and Lingshan counties and cities. According to Guangzhou Daily, a Chiang Party mouthpiece in Guangzhou, the people's armed forces in southern Guangdong have now grown to over 9,000 men, with over 5,000 rifles, divided into two branches. One branch is distributed in the mountainous areas of Qin County, Fangcheng, and Hepu counties, and the other branch is distributed in Lianjiang, Hua County, Wuchuan, Suixi, Haikang, Maoming, and Dianbai counties. The people's armed forces have universally established people's political power in the villages and counties. Except for the county seat and six townships in Hua County and Wuchuan, and except for three townships in Lianjiang and Suixi, people's political power has been fully established everywhere else. The people's armed forces in northern Guangdong are also active. Small-scale battles occur from time to time in Wengyuan and Nanxiong. According to reports from Shanghai, the Chiang bandits' vital transportation routes, the East and North Rivers, are virtually paralyzed. In October, over fifty Chiang bandit vessels on the East River were attacked by the people's armed forces. The same situation has occurred on the North River. In Guangxi, the people's armed forces once attacked and entered the county seats of Gui County and Heng County. The county magistrates of these two counties have been dismissed and investigated by the Chiang bandit Guangxi Provincial Government on charges of "failing to respond effectively." The Chiang bandit Ministry of National Defense is extremely panicked by the strength of the people's armed forces in Guangdong and Guangxi. It is said that the 174th Brigade of the Guangxi Army, which was fighting in northern Anhui, has been transferred back to Guangxi, in a vain attempt to stop the development of the people's armed forces.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 14th: According to reports from Shanghai's Dagongbao and other newspapers, the people's armed forces in Jiangsu and Anhui are active. The people's armed forces in southern Jiangsu are approaching the suburbs of Shanghai. On the morning of October 18th, they attacked the Qingpu-Shanghai Highway, burning the No. 8 bridge 20 li northeast of Qingpu. The people's armed forces in southern Anhui also attacked Jixi city for the tenth time on the same day late at night, attacking and entering the pillbox outside the north gate, capturing five Chiang bandits and seizing nine rifles, and burning the pillbox. Currently, half of the county's villages are controlled by the people's armed forces.
