Xinhua News Agency, East China, 23rd. The Shandong Provincial River Affairs Bureau convened a meeting of the heads of the Yellow River management offices in each county on the 8th of this month to study winter defense measures for the Yellow River. It directed that each dangerous works site should promptly drive in ice-repelling piles (to defend against ice floes damaging the embankments) and other tasks. It also drafted a budget for materials and transportation costs needed for river defense next spring and summer and began preparations. It is estimated that over 100,900 cubic meters of bricks and stones, 56,400 hemp ropes, over 26,000 straw ropes, over 40,000 jin of lead wire, 260,000 sacks, 213,000 wooden stakes, over 5,750,000 jin of straw, over 2,220,000 jin of willow branches, and 220 rolls of wire cages are needed. Preliminary estimates put the total value at over 3,715,650,000 North Sea currency (each yuan equivalent to approximately 20 Nationalist currency yuan). Including transportation costs, over 13,700,000 yuan and over 27,160,000 jin of grain will be required. Currently, the Yellow River management offices in each county are intensifying their efforts in winter defense and the preparation and transportation of materials for Yellow River management next year. Kenli (a newly established county northeast of Lijin) mobilized 10,000 civilian laborers on the 18th of this month to repair the breach in the inner bank of the Wangjiazhuang dangerous works.
