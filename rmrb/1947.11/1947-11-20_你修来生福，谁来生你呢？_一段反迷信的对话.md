　　"You Cultivate Blessings for the Next Life, Who Will Give Birth to You?"
  　A Anti-Superstition Dialogue
　　Wu Genshu is from Qiaoshang Village, Sixth District, Huguan. He is an activist and propagandist in the village's emancipation movement. Through his allegro performances, he has resolved many issues. Guo Jingui is an old "Qingcha Jiao" teacher with over twenty years of experience. In the past, he would set up stalls at every temple fair to promote feudal superstition and enslave the masses. He was particularly famous in the Changzhi border area. During the movement, he was detained by the masses. At this time, Comrade Genshu thought that he was not a landlord or a special agent. As long as he was reformed, he could still be a good propagandist serving the masses. Therefore, he provided him with some anti-superstition books and tried to reform him. Once, Genshu deliberately asked:
　　"You have done good deeds all your life, why don't the crops in the field grow well?"
　　Jin Gui replied: "People who are lucky have clean land, people who are unlucky get sick."
　　Genshu answered him with facts: "With fertilizer, the land is clean, if you are lazy and don't move, you will get sick."
　　Wu Genshu's words made him silent, and he asked again: "Why is your wife not good?"
　　Jin Gui said: "Marrying a wife is for having children, if she cannot give birth, how can there be harmony?"
　　Genshu replied: "Marrying a husband is for mutual assistance in production, if you are not home, how can there be offspring?"
　　Jin Gui said: "Cold grains, cold hemp, cold children crawl on the ground."
　　Genshu said: "Cold grains, cold hemp are seeds sprouting, how can you say 'cold children'?" Again, he managed to shut Jin Gui up. Then he asked: "You have done good all your life, why are you suffering like this?"
　　Jin Gui said: "This life is for cultivating, the next life is for enjoying."
　　Genshu seized on this even more, and then retorted: "In the past, you persuaded men not to marry and women not to marry. If you enjoy blessings in the next life, who will give birth to you?" This left Jin Gui speechless. After three months of work, Jin Gui was finally reformed. At the Gushenjiao Grandma Temple fair, he used new content to explain the rights and wrongs of old sayings and promote anti-superstition with the "X Zhang Village Romance."

　　“你修来生福，谁来生你呢？”
  　一段反迷信的对话
    武根舒是壶关六区桥上村人，他是该村翻身运动中板人，宣传家，经过他的快板宣传，解决了许多问题，郭金贵是已经二十多年的传“清查教”的老教头，在过去的每个庙会上，他都去搭棚宣传封建迷信奴化群众，特别在长治边方非常出名，运动中被群众扣押，这时根舒同志想到他不是地主特务，只要改造过来他还是一个为群众服务的好宣传者，于是他便供给他一些反迷信的书看，并设法改造他，有一次根舒有意识的问道：
    “你行了一辈子善，为什么地里庄稼长的不好？”
    金贵回答道：“人家起运地干净，人家倒霉地生病。”
    根舒又用事实回答他：“有粪有工地干净，懒坐不动地生病。”
    武根舒说的他不吭气了，又问：“你为啥给媳妇不好。”
    金贵说：“娶妻娶妻为的是生儿养女，她不能生养怎样和气”。
    根舒又答：“嫁汉嫁汉为的是互助生产，你不到家怎能生养”。
    金贵说：“冷生谷冷生麻冷生孩子就地爬”。
    根舒说：“冷生谷冷生麻是种子发芽，冷生孩子是怎说”？又算把金贵说住了。接着又问：“你行了一辈子好，为何也这样受罪呢？”
    金贵说：“这生修下再生享”。
    根舒更抓住了，于是反问他道：“你过去劝人男不娶妻女不嫁汉。你再生享福谁来生你”？更说的金贵无话对答了。这样经过三个月的工夫，终于把金贵改造了，在神郊奶奶庙古会上用新的内容讲解起古话正误与×掌村演义宣传反迷信了。
