　　International Week
    (November 17th to 23rd)
    The anti-fascist fury of the working people in France and Italy has become a prairie fire in the past week.

    In France, only two weeks after the large-scale demonstrations by citizens and workers in Marseille on the 10th, the strike movement has spread to many major cities and ports such as Paris, Bordeaux, Toulon, and Nice, as well as the provinces of Ain, Seine, Nord, Pas-de-Calais, Hérault, and Rhône, and is now rapidly sweeping across the country. All French ports on the Mediterranean have become dead ports, and everything from light industrial flour mills to heavy industrial coal mines has been paralyzed. The total number of strikers has surged to around one million. Even civil servants and teachers are beginning to take action. The scale of the movement is so magnificent, and the organization of the movement is so strong, that strike committees are being established everywhere, workers are occupying factories in an orderly manner, organizing strict picket lines, and bravely resisting armed suppression by military police. The goal of the struggle has combined the economic demands for increased wages with the political demands for thorough democratic reform, which is "to demand a democratic government in which the Communist Party at least plays a leading role" (French Communist Party's Letter to the Men and Women of France).

    Faced with this situation, the French reactionaries have shown great fear and panic on the one hand, and on the other hand, they are trying to unite all reactionary forces to carry out bloody suppression of the French working people in order to save their dying reactionary rule. The forced resignation of Ramadier and the emergence of Schuman, who flaunts a similar anti-communist and anti-people program to the French national traitor Blum, both mark the intensification and sharpening of the class struggle in France. Because the French reactionaries are prepared to implement a "strict and perhaps unconventional measure" to make a "last chance" struggle before their death. The French Communist Party has called on "the laboring masses to unite and act" to defend the republic and to defend peace and democracy.

    In Italy, the great movement against the fascist reactionary authorities is continuing to expand and penetrate into the countryside. Two hundred thousand agricultural workers in the southern province of Puglia have launched a general strike. The Italian General Confederation of Labor has called on workers and peasants to unite closely and fight side by side. In major cities such as Milan, Bari, and Sicily, bloody struggles between strikers and police are taking place everywhere. The strikers' strong and heroic resistance has forced the fully armed military police into a "fragile defense." In order to further unite the struggle, the people of Italy have formed the "Anti-Fascist Alliance for the Defense of Republican Democracy" in Naples and other places. The Italian reactionaries, led by De Gasperi, in addition to continuing to deploy troops and generals to carry out suppression, are urgently seeking to "expand" their reactionary government in order to make a desperate struggle.

    The political situation in France and Italy has made American imperialism tremble. The cries for "immediate aid," "swift action," and "delay will be punished" are all over the place. The US Special Session, with the primary purpose of "urgently aiding France and Italy," opened under these circumstances. Truman hurriedly demanded that more than 500 million yuan of "emergency aid" be given to the French and Italian reactionaries, which is the entire content of the long-rumored "emergency aid to Europe." This "aid" and Truman's inability to avoid lamenting that "our free economy is also in danger" fully reflect the plight of American imperialism, which is outwardly strong but inwardly weak and unable to take care of itself. As is well known, the United States has loaned more than 3 billion US dollars to France and Italy after the war, but as a result, it has brought about serious political and economic crises in the two countries. Now, with such a small amount of money, let alone saving the French and Italian reactionaries who are already terminally ill.

    The Greek Democratic Army has continued to report victories in the past week. Since the counter-offensive began in August, the liberated areas have been greatly expanded. According to Agence France-Presse, "the liberated areas of the Democratic Army have exceeded four-fifths of Greek territory," which marks that the rule of the Greek reactionary government is like a candle in the wind. American imperialism is therefore very anxious, and on the 17th, it openly announced the organization of the US-Greek Joint Chiefs of Staff to implement naked armed intervention. However, this heinous and stupid act of American imperialism does not show its strength, but as the Yugoslav Borba newspaper said, "This shows the fragility of American imperialism and is proof of the fear of the growing democratic forces in Greece."

    Recently, two noteworthy major events have occurred in the new democratic countries of Southeast Europe: First, Czechoslovakia exposed the treasonous activities of the Slovak Democratic Party; Hungary purged forty-eight reactionary "Independent Party" members from the parliament; Romania carried out a cabinet reshuffle, replacing the traitorous Foreign Minister Tatarescu and seven other cabinet members; the Polish Socialist and Communist parties decided to strengthen cooperation between the two parties. The facts show that the new democratic regimes in these Southeast European countries are becoming more and more consolidated. Second, the economic construction of Yugoslavia is developing rapidly. Many enterprises have completed this year's production plans ahead of schedule and are now moving towards the road of socialist development. Poland's heavy industry has exceeded the pre-war level, and both Bulgaria and Albania have successfully completed or exceeded their production plans. These facts show that: planned economy is one of the main roads to national rejuvenation; and this planned economy can only be realized under the new democratic or socialist political system.

　　国际一周
    （十一月十七至二十三日）
    法意两国劳动人民的反法西斯怒火，一周来已成燎原之势。
    在法国，从十日马赛市民和工人举行大示威后仅仅两周，罢工运动已遍及巴黎、波尔多、土伦、尼斯等许多大城市与海港，以及恩、赛纳、诺尔、加莱、赫劳和罗尼诸省，目前正迅速席卷全国。法国在地中海所有港口，都变成了死港，从轻工业的面粉到重工业的煤矿，都形成了瘫痪之状，罢工总人数已激增到百万左右。甚至公务员与教员也在开始行动起来了。运动的规模既如此雄伟，运动的组织又如此坚强，各地正纷纷成立罢工委员会，工人有秩序地占领工厂、组织严密的纠察队，并勇敢地抗拒军警的武装弹压。斗争的目标，已将增资的经济要求和彻底民主改革的政治要求结合起来，这就是“要求一个民主政府，在这个政府中，共产党至少要起着领导的作用”（法共告法国男女书）。
    面对着这种形势，法国反动派一方面表示了极大的恐惧和慌张，另一方面却企图纠合一切反动势力，对法国劳动人民实行血腥的镇压，来挽救其垂危的反动统治。拉马第的被迫下台，与舒曼登场时之标榜着和法兰西民族叛逆者勃鲁姆类似的反共反人民政纲，均标志着法国阶级斗争的更趋紧张和尖锐化。因为法国反动派已准备实行一个“严厉而且或者是不合流俗的措施”，作一次“最后机会”的临死前的挣扎。法共为此已号召“劳工大众团结与行动起来”，为保卫共和国，保卫和平民主而斗争。
    在意大利，反对法西斯反动当局的大运动，正继续扩大并深入到乡村，南部的蒲格里亚省的二十万农业工人举行了总罢耕，意总工会为此已号召工人与农民紧密团结并肩而战。在米兰、巴利等重要城市及西西里岛等地，到处都发生罢工者与警察的流血斗争，罢工者强烈英勇的反抗，迫使全副武装的军警陷于“脆弱性的防御”中。意大利人民为了进一步的团结斗争，在那不勒斯等地已组成“保卫共和民主的反法西斯同盟”。以加斯贝利为首的意国反动派，除继续调兵遣将实行镇压外，正急谋“扩大”其反动政府，以作一番绝望的挣扎。
    法意的政局使美帝国主义大为发抖了。“立即援助”、“迅速采取行动”、“稽延将遭惩罚”的急救声嚷成一片。以“紧急援助法意”为主要目的之美国特别会，就在这种情况下开幕。杜鲁门急忙要求给法意反动派五亿余元的“紧急援助”，这就是喧嚷已久的“紧急援欧”的全部内容。此一“援助”与杜鲁门之不能不哀鸣：“我们的自由经济也在危险中”，充分反映了美帝国主义外强中干，自顾不暇的窘态。如众周知，战后美国对法意的贷款已达三十亿余美元，结果反而招来了该两国严重的政治经济危机，现在用这样一笔极少的钱，更不用说，是万万挽救不了业已病入膏肓的法意反动派的。
    希腊民主军一周来仍捷报频传。自八月间开始反攻后，解放地区已大为扩大，据法新社报导，目前“民主军的解放区已超过希腊领土的五分之四”，这标志着希腊反动政府的统治，已如风前之烛。美帝国主义因此大为焦急，竟于十七日公然宣布组织美希联合参谋部，实行赤裸裸的武装干涉。但美帝国主义这种穷凶极恶的蠢举，并不是表示了它的强，却如南斯拉夫战斗报所说：“这表示了美帝国主义的脆弱，是对日益增长的希腊民主力量恐惧的证明”。
    最近东南欧新民主各国发生了值得注意的两项大事：第一、捷克揭发了斯洛伐克民主党的叛国活动，匈牙利从议会中清洗了四十八名反动的“独立党”议员，罗国实行了内阁的改组，撤换了叛国分子外长塔塔莱斯哥及其他七名阁员，波兰社共两党则决定加强两党的合作。事实说明了这些东南欧各国的新民主政权正益趋巩固中。第二、南斯拉夫的经济建设正飞速发展，许多企业都提前完成了今年的生产计划，目前已走向社会主义发展的大道。波兰的重工业已跃过了战前水平，保阿两国也胜利地完成或超过了生产计划。这些事实则说明了：计划经济乃是国家复兴的主要道路之一；而这种计划经济，只有在新民主主义或社会主义的政治制度下，才有实现的可能。（新华社）
