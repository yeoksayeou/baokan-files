　　Land Returned to Families, Everyone Farms Intensively
  　Yuanxing Poor Peasants Achieve Highest Yields
    [Our Newspaper, Taiyue, 17th dispatch] In Shangguan, Yangcheng, there is a Joint Mutual Aid Brigade, the Yuanxing Village Brigade, which, led by poor peasants and hired laborers, has practiced intensive farming, achieving a "cultivate three, surplus one" result. On the 11th of this month, the Yuanxing Mutual Aid Brigade summarized the year's production. Although it was a dry year, thanks to the entire brigade implementing drought prevention and intensive farming, the summer wheat fields of 1,130 mu yielded 1,210 shi, averaging 8 dou 9 sheng 5 he per mu. The autumn crop of 2,190 mu of millet yielded 2,455 shi, averaging 1 shi 1 dou 1 he per mu. The 630 mu of corn yielded 862 shi. The 270 mu of beans yielded 320 shi, as well as various sideline productions such as hemp, sesame, persimmons, spinning, weaving, and transportation. The total income of the village for the past ten months, converted into grain (millet), was 8,990 shi, averaging 5 shi 7 dou 8 sheng per person, achieving a "cultivate three, surplus one" result. If the income from various vegetables is added, it would be even more abundant. Among them, the income of hired peasants was more than that of the average person. The Yang Xiaoqi mutual aid group, consisting of six households, all of whom were former hired peasants, had a total of 18 people and 87 mu of land. This year, their agricultural income, converted into millet, was 152 shi 9 dou 3 sheng. Their sideline income, converted into millet, was 88 shi 6 dou, totaling 241 shi 5 dou 3 sheng 6 he, averaging 13 shi 4 dou per person. In this group, the hired worker Yang Yuanxiang had the highest income. His average yield of millet was 2 shi 2 dou 8 sheng per mu, and his average yield of wheat was 1 shi 5 dou 5 sheng per mu. His family of five, with 18 mu of land, earned 58 shi 9 dou 2 sheng. His sideline income was 45 shi 3 dou, averaging 20 shi 8 dou 4 sheng of millet per person. The liberated peasants of the brigade discussed why they had a bumper harvest this year. First, the poor peasants and hired laborers obtained land, and their enthusiasm for production was unprecedentedly high, so they took the lead in agricultural and sideline production. Yang Yuanxiang said, "We are just happy. Now the land is our own, and the grain we grow is our own. How can we not work hard? My crops are growing very well this year." Qunfu said, "People have been liberated, and the land has been liberated. My family has worked for landlords for three generations, and I have never seen the soil so clean this year." The whole village, led by the poor peasants and hired laborers, seized leadership of the village administration last year and replaced the landlord village chief Shangguan Zikui and others. This spring, they thoroughly cleaned out the landlords and rich peasants Yang Fenglian and others who were serving as mutual aid group leaders, and formed a production committee with the hired laborers Yang Xiaoqi, Yang Yuanxiang, and others, leading everyone in production from dawn till dusk. Secondly, the organization of labor was well-led, with all men and women, full and semi-laborers, having specific tasks. For example, during the three autumn harvests, the male full and semi-laborers carried manure and millet, corn, plowed fields, and built mounds, while the female full and semi-laborers cut millet and beans, harvested corn, rooted stubble, picked cotton, and weeded. The old men operated plows, sowed seeds, smoked manure, and threshed. In addition to participating in millet cutting, the children mainly pulled seed drills and picked up stones. Moreover, a system of work points was adopted, with more work earning more points, stimulating everyone's enthusiasm for production. The woman Yan Laixiu usually only earned eight points for cutting millet, while Li Xiaoniao earned ten points for cutting quickly and well, stimulating other women to organize as well. It was stipulated that plowing one mu with an ox would earn ten points, but Yang Yuanxiang's ox plowed 2.6 mu a day, earning him 26 points, which encouraged Zhang Zhijian's ox to plow four mu a day. In addition, the organization of labor for intensive farming and drought prevention increased labor productivity. For example, the Yang Xiaoqi mutual aid group applied 60 loads of manure per mu for wheat last year and plowed it three times. This spring, they planted millet early, transplanted seedlings completely, and hoed four times in the drought. Yang Yuanxiang dug pits for pumpkins in the winter, four feet deep and five feet wide, and flooded them several times with ash and snow water, so one pumpkin seedling yielded more than 100 jin. Now the brigade is experimenting with winter millet.
    [Our Newspaper, Taiyue, 17th dispatch] The Wang Sanguan Mutual Aid Brigade, a labor hero in Qin County, summarized the autumn harvest on the 7th. This year, relying on organization, more plowing, more hoeing, and more manure application, a bumper harvest was achieved. The entire brigade has 1,268.2 mu of land. The original estimated yield was 1,010 shi 4 dou 6 sheng, but the actual yield was 1,093 shi 6 dou 9 sheng, an increase of 83 shi 2 dou 3 sheng. Wang Sanguan's seven mu of millet had an original planned yield of seven shi, but the actual yield was thirteen shi seven dou five sheng, an increase of six shi seven dou. Similarly, the millet of He Lai had an original planned yield of one shi three dou, but the actual yield was two shi, an increase of seven dou. This is because they seriously plowed three times, hoed three times, and applied 40 loads of manure per mu, so they came to the conclusion: "Only by processing the land can we increase yields." Now the entire brigade has put forward "one year of farming, two years of hard work," "more bedding in the sheepfold is enough for manure," "strive for another bumper harvest next year," and "actively organize winter production." First, the mutual aid was rectified. In addition to organizing women to spin and weave, a group of male semi-laborers were organized to collect manure, a part to cut firewood on the mountains, and male full-laborers to carry firewood, smoke manure, and bed the sheepfold with manure.

　　土地还家人人精耕细作
  　元兴贫雇收成最高
    【本报太岳十七日电】阳城上官中有联合互助大队，元兴村大队，以贫雇带头精耕细作，作到耕三余一。本月十一日，元兴互助大队总结全年生产，今年天虽旱，但由于全大队实行了防旱与精耕细作，夏季一千一百三十亩麦田，收一千二百一十石，平均每亩产量八斗九升五合，秋季二千一百九十亩谷子，实收二千四百五十五石，平均每亩产量一石一斗一合，六百卅亩玉茭，实收八百六十二石，豆子二百七十亩，实收三百二十石，以及大小麻、芝麻、柿子，与纺花织布运输等各种副业生产的收入，折合（以谷子计算）全村十个月来总收入为八千九百九十石，平均大小人口每人收入五石七斗八升，作到耕三余一，如加上各种蔬菜的收入，则更丰富了。其中雇贫比一般人收入较多，杨小其互助组六户，全系从雇贫翻身的，共十八口人，八十七亩土地，今年农业收入折合谷子一百五十二石九斗三升，副业收入折合谷子八十八石六斗，两宗共收入二百四十一石五斗三升六合，每人平均收入十三石四斗。而该组内尤以雇工杨元祥收入最大，其谷子每亩平均产量二石二斗八升，麦子每亩平均一石五斗五升，全家五口人，十八亩土地，收入五十八石九斗二升，副业收入四十五石三斗，平均每人谷子廿石八斗四升。该大队翻身农民讨论出为什么今年丰收，首先是雇贫农得到了土地，生产劲头空前提高，所以他们在农副业的生产中处处带头去干。杨元祥说：“我们就是高兴，现在土地是自己的，打下粮食是自己的，还能不下力干，我今年的庄稼长的就好着哩”，群富说：“人翻身啦，地也翻身啦，我家三辈子都是给地主干，那里见过今年地垡的这样净”，全村以雇贫为首，去年就掌握了村政领导权，撤换了地主村长上官志奎等，今春又彻底清洗了当互助组长的地主富农杨风连等五人，以雇贫杨小其、杨元祥等组成生产委员会，起早搭黑的带领大家生产。其次组织分工领导好，全大队男女全半劳力皆具体分工做活。如在三秋运动中，男全半劳力担粪担谷子、玉茭、垡地、垒＠，妇女全半劳力割谷、豆子、收玉茭、刨茬、摘棉花、拔草等，老汉掌犁、下种、薰粪、打场等，男女儿童除参加割谷外，主要是牵耧、拾石头。而且采用了按活评分，多做活多记工，刺激了大家生产情绪。妇女燕来秀割谷平常只记八分，而李小鸟割的快又好便记了十分，刺激其他妇女也组织起来。牛犁地规定一亩记十分，而杨元祥的牛一天犁二亩六分，便记二十六分工，鼓励了张志俭的牛，一天能犁四亩地。此外组织力量精耕细作、防旱，提高了劳动技术。如杨小其互助组，去年种麦，每亩上粪六十担，犁三遍，今春种谷早，捉苗全，旱锄四遍，杨元祥种南瓜，冬季便刨窝，深四尺宽五尺，以灰土雪水淹数次，所以一苗南瓜便结了一百余斤，现在大队又试验种冬谷。
    【本报太岳十七日电】沁县龙泉村劳动英雄王三官互助大队，于七日总结秋收。今年依靠组织起来，多犁多锄多上粪，达到丰收。全大队有土地一千二百六十八亩二分，原评定产量一千零十石四斗六升，此次实产量一千零九十三石六斗九升，增产八十三石二斗三升。王三官七亩谷，原规定产量七石，实产量十三石七斗五升，增产六石七斗。又如合来的谷，原评定产量一石三斗，实产量两石，增产七斗。这因为他们认真的作到犁三遍，锄三遍，每亩上粪四十担，所以他们得出一个结论：“只有在地上加工，才能增加产量。现全大队又提出了“一年庄稼两年闹”，“多垫羊圈够上粪”，“争取明年再丰收”，“积极组织冬季生产”，首先整顿了互助，除把妇女组织纺织以外，组织了一部分男半劳力拾粪，一部份上山砍柴火，男全劳力担柴薰粪与垫羊圈粪。
