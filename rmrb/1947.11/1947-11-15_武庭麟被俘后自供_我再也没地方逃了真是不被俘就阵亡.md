Xinhua News Agency,豫陕 Frontline, 12th: Our reporter Mù Xīn reports: Wu Tinglin, commander of the enemy's 15th Division, who was captured after the defeat in the Battle of Jiaxian, told reporters: "I had nowhere else to run." He said, "It was truly an inescapable disaster. I escaped from Zhongyue Village, only to encounter you attacking Tiemen; I escaped from Linru, and you chased me to Jiaxian. It was destined that it would either be capture or death." The 15th Division he commanded originally had two brigades. The 135th Brigade was wiped out in northern Shaanxi this spring and had just been replenished. On September 17th, it was completely annihilated in Shanxian. The 64th Brigade was first hit hard in Hengshui in late August. On September 9th, when Wu Tinglin personally led the brigade to attack Xin'an, a regiment was wiped out in Zhongyue Village, and Wu Tinglin and others fled back to Luoyang in disgrace. On October 2nd, the brigade and the division headquarters were wiped out at Tiemen. Wu Tinglin disguised himself and escaped on a donkey. Just as he arrived in Linru, the People's Liberation Army's offensive was closing in again. Finally, in Jiaxian, he and his remnants laid down their weapons. Wu Tinglin, 55 years old, with 30 years of military service, seemed somewhat unable to explain the series of defeats, and his expression was very awkward, especially when he thought of the dirty air Li Tiejun gave him in the past two months. He was originally a local tyrant in western Henan. Under Chiang Kai-shek's policy of eliminating miscellaneous troops, he was driven to the front lines of the civil war. Mentioning these things, he said angrily: "It is not that someone wants to eliminate us, but it is the policy of eliminating miscellaneous troops (referring to Chiang Kai-shek) that puts us to death." He described Li Tiejun's discrimination and abuse towards him, saying: Just after arriving at Tiemen at the beginning of last month, I discovered that it was your main force. I telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek, and he said I was exaggerating. I telegraphed Li Tiejun three times in a row, and he ignored me. Finally, he sent me a telegram saying: Soldiers should fight. When I was already surrounded by your army, Li still ordered me to retreat to Xin'an. Later, I escaped back to Luoyang. The insults Li gave me were something I had never experienced in my 30 years of military service. I requested reorganization and replenishment. Even if all the miscellaneous personnel of the division headquarters and the 64th Brigade were counted, it only amounted to one battalion. They still wanted me to continue fighting. Later, after many requests, and with the help of Liu Maoen, I was finally approved to go to Kaifeng for reorganization and replenishment. However, as soon as the military situation became tense, we three (Wu, Deputy Division Commander Yang Tianming, and Yao Beichen) were ordered to go to Linru to command local teams. This time, when things got tight, I requested reinforcements, but they sent over the remnants of the 190th Regiment. When Jiaxian was in a tight spot, I telegraphed again for assistance. Li Tiejun replied that he would personally lead the 3rd Reorganized Division to support, and they would arrive by the 3rd. I asked him if it was true, and he replied that if I didn't believe him, I was free to act. Speaking of this, he smiled bitterly and said, "Now I am really free."

### 武庭麟被俘后自供  “我再也没地方逃了真是不被俘就阵亡”

　　武庭麟被俘后自供
    “我再也没地方逃了真是不被俘就阵亡”
    【新华社豫陕前线十二日电】本社记者穆欣报导：郏县之役兵败被俘的敌第十五师师长武庭麟对记者说：“我再也没个地方逃了。”他说：“真是在劫难逃，我从中月村逃出了，又遇着你们攻铁门；临汝逃出来，你们又追到郏县，正是注定了不是被俘就是阵亡。”他所统辖的十五师原有两个旅，一三五旅今春在陕北被歼，刚补充起来，九月十七日又在陕县被全部歼灭。六十四旅八月下旬在横水初次受创，九月九日武庭麟亲率该旅犯新安时，在中月村被歼一个团，武庭麟等狼狈逃回洛阳。十月二日该旅及师部在铁门被歼，武庭麟化装骑毛驴逃跑，刚到临汝，解放军的攻势，矛头又逼了过来，最后在郏县和他的残部一起放下了武器。五十五岁，从军卅年的武庭麟一谈到这一连串的败绩，再想到两个月来李铁军给他受的肮脏气，不免有些难以自解，神情显得十分尴尬。他本来是豫西的土霸王，在蒋贼消灭杂牌政策下，被赶到内战火线，提起这些，他很愤恨的说：“并不是什么人要消灭我们，是人家（指蒋贼）那消灭杂牌的政策置我们于死地。”他叙述了李铁军对他的歧视虐待，说：上月初刚到铁门，就发现是贵军主力，我打电报给蒋介石，他说我夸大。打电报给李铁军，一连三次都不理，最后给我个电报说：军人就要打仗。当已被贵军包围时，李还命令我退守新安，后来逃回洛阳，李给我的侮辱是我从军三十年所没有受过的。我要求整补，把师部及六十四旅全部杂务人员都算上才只编了一个营，他们却要我带着再打，后来经多方请求，刘茂恩也从中帮助，才获准到开封去整补，但是军情一紧就又令我们三个（武和副师长杨天明、姚北辰）到临汝指挥地方团队。这次吃紧，我要求部队增援，却又把一九○团残部送了来。郏县一紧，我再打电报求援，李铁军回电说：将亲率整三师来援，三号就能赶到。我问他可是真的，他回电说你不相信，就可以自由行动。讲到这里他苦笑一下说：“现在我真的自由了。”
