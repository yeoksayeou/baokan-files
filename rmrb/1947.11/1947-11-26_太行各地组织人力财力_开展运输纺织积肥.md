　　【This Dispatch from Taihang on the 24th】The majority of the Taihang area has completed autumn plowing and has shifted to winter production, engaging in transportation, textile and other sideline productions to make up for insufficient income, accumulating fertilizer and delivering manure, preparing for next year's production. After the Licheng County Party Committee issued the call, the villages responded one after another, formulating winter production plans. In Beiliu, nine transportation teams (including 193 people and animals) and 13 small cooperatives were organized within three days, raising 1.33 million yuan in shares, 1,730 jin of dates, 760 jin of peanuts, and 3 shi and 9 dou of refined grains. The Second District has formed 177 small cooperatives and started production. The county also decided that county and district should set up cooperative committees, and each base point should set up a central cooperative, and the village rely on the original village cooperatives or village production committees to uniformly lead various production, and be responsible for solving the difficulties of the masses in terms of funds, raw materials, and marketing. Qijiaohe, Fangtai, Houjiadi and other villages in the Seventh District of Xiyang, under the slogan of "relying on the mountain to eat the mountain", organized mountain cutting teams and medicinal herb digging groups, and have now cut 600 bundles of whip poles (110 in each bundle), and the village digging herbs has earned 121,000 yuan. Changzhi, Pingshun, Lingchuan, Pingding and other counties have successively carried out autumn plowing summaries and formulated winter production plans; the Yushe County Party Committee recently issued a production call of "one stone of rice for men and ten jin of cotton for women"; the First Administrative Office proposed that this winter's production should complete 950,000 shi of grain to overcome the famine. During mobilization, all localities universally carried out "calculating family property and comparing time", breaking the passive thinking of some masses who were satisfied with "making a living" at present, and establishing the correct thinking of accumulating small amounts to make a large amount, and making long-term plans. It is necessary to have the correct thinking of overcoming the famine and making up for the deficiencies by "eating while running, instead of sitting and eating." And attention was paid to solving the difficulties of the poor peasants, and they were relied on as the backbone to carry out the movement. For example, in Wangzhuang, Pingshun, two kinds of thoughts were initially discovered: one was complacency, which was mainly the thought of the middle-peasant class who harvested a lot of grain; the other was that there was no capital to engage in production, which was the actual thought of the poor peasants. After the poor peasants took the lead in comparing the years, calculating the poor harvests, and calculating various expenses, they cleared the middle-peasant's thinking, and the credit department issued a large number of loans to solve the difficulties of the poor peasants who had no capital, and launched a production movement. Now more than 30 people and 6 animals have gone out for transportation. The Wuxiang Third District United Cooperative has purchased 4,000 jin of wool in order to organize the masses to spin wool, and has promoted 14 flat knitting machines to various villages. The Wu'an branch of the Jinnan Bank adjusted and loaned 30 million yuan, distributed to five famine-stricken areas including the Second, Third, Fourth, Eighth, and Eleventh Districts, to help poor peasants solve the financial difficulties of overcoming the famine and production. In addition, some areas seized the time to accumulate fertilizer and deliver manure after the harvest, specifically preparing for next year's large-scale production. For example, in Lingdi Village, Heshun, under the slogan of "delivering manure and transportation at the same time", Comrade Yan Bingwen, the political director, led 10 laborers to deliver 445 dan of manure in the dark night, squeezing out 6 laborers and animals each, transporting for 10 days, and earning 120,000 yuan. Licheng Licungou promoted manure accumulation by summarizing production and letting the masses discuss the reasons for increased production. A comparison was made between applying more manure, applying less manure, and not applying manure, which greatly promoted manure accumulation. According to statistics from 31 households in the village, more than 10,000 dan have now been accumulated. In order to create convenient conditions for the masses to produce and solve the difficulties of burning coal and marketing, the Yushi County Government started construction of four main roads before the autumn, and the Zuoyu Road has begun to be used by large vehicles. The Xi (Yang) Zan (Huang) counties are also rushing to repair the Huangshaling section of the Xizan Road, which will be completed soon. Once traffic is open, it will play a significant role in the exchange of materials between the mountains and the plains.

　　太行各地组织人力财力
    开展运输纺织积肥
    【本报太行二十四日电】太行大部地区，已完成秋耕，转上冬季生产，进行运输、纺织等副业生产，弥补款收，积肥送粪，为明年生产作准备。黎城自县委发出号召后，各村纷纷响应，订定冬季生产计划，北流三天内组织起九个运输队（包括人、畜百九十三个）、十三个小型合作社，已集股金一百三十三万元，一千七百三十斤枣、七百六十斤花生、三石九斗细粮。二区已组成一百七十七个小型合作社，开始生产。该县并决定县区均成立合作委员会，各基点成立中心合作社，村依托原有村社或村生产委员会，统一领导各种生产、负责解决群众的资金、原料及运销等困难。昔阳七区三教河、方台、候家地等村，在“靠山吃山”的口号下，组织了砍山队、刨药组，现已砍鞭杆六百捆（每捆百一十根），刨药村赚洋十二万一千元。长治、平顺、陵川、平定等县，先后进行了秋耕总结，订出冬季生产计划；榆社县委于最近发出“男人一石米、女人十斤花”的生产号召；一专署则提出今年冬季生产，要完成九十五万石粮食渡灾荒。各地在动员时，皆普遍的进行了算家当、比时光，打破了部分群众满足于当下“糊口”的消极思想，树立了积少成多、长远打算。要“能跑着吃、就不坐着吃”的渡荒补窟窿的正确思想。并注意了解决贫雇的困难，依托他们为骨干开展了运动。如平顺王庄开始发现有两种思想：一是自满，这主要是打粮多的中农阶层的思想；一是搞生产没本钱，这是贫雇的实际思想。经贫雇带头比年成、算歉收、算各项开支帐，打通了中农思想，信用部大批发放贷款，解决了贫雇农民没本钱的困难，开展了生产运动。现已有三十余人、六个牲口出去运输。武乡三区区联社，为组织群众纺毛生产，已买回羊毛四千斤，并把十四架平机推广到各村。冀南银行武安支行，调剂贷款三千万元，分配到二、三、四、八、十一等五个歉收区，帮助贫雇农民解决渡荒生产的资金困难。另外有些地区于收耕结束后，便抓紧了积肥送粪，具体的为明年大生产作了准备。如和顺岭底村，在“送粪运输两不误”的口号下，政治主任阎炳文同志领导十个劳力，黑夜送粪四百四十五担，挤出劳畜力各六个，运输十天，赚洋十二万元。潞城李村沟通过总结生产，让群众讨论增产的原因。多上粪和少上粪没上粪作了对比，大大推动了积肥。据该村三十一户统计，现已积了一万多担。榆社县府为给群众生产创造便利条件，解决烧煤运销等困难，于秋前即已开工修筑四条大路，现左榆道已开始通行大车。昔（阳）赞（皇）两县，亦正在赶修昔赞道上的黄沙岭段，不久即可完成，一旦通车，对山上山下的物资交流，将起很大作用。
