Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: Sofia dispatch: The Fifth Congress of the Bulgarian Youth Workers' Union, the Eleventh Congress of the Youth Farmers' Union, the Executive Committee of the Socialist Youth Farmers' Union, the Executive Committee of the "Zveno" Youth Union, and the Executive Committee of the Radical Youth Union held a joint meeting at the beginning of the month, and passed a resolution on the 5th to establish a unified democratic youth alliance. This is a response to the Fatherland Front's declaration last month calling for the reorganization of the Fatherland Front into a unified anti-imperialist political organization. The resolution stated: "The Democratic Youth Alliance will consolidate the friendship between Bulgarian youth and the youth of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and other Slavic countries. It will be an active member of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, a powerful part of the world's anti-imperialist aggression movement, and an active fighter for the people's freedom and independence, lasting peace and true democracy, and a brighter future for youth." When the meeting opened, Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov sent a telegram of congratulations, encouraging Bulgarian youth to oppose imperialist aggression, oppose instigating a new war, defend Bulgaria's independence and autonomy, and advance towards socialism. The Congress of the Bulgarian Anti-Fascist Fighters Alliance, with 200,000 members, also held a congress at the end of last month, announcing its support for the Fatherland Front declaration and expressing its full commitment to unite all loyal fighters to fight against imperialism.

    【新华社陕北十三日电】索菲亚讯：保加利亚青年工人联盟第五次大会，青年农民联盟第十一次大会，社会主义青年农民联盟执委会，“兹维诺”青年联盟执委会及急进青年联盟执委会，于月初举行联席会议，并于五日通过决议，成立单一的民主青年联盟。这是对上月祖国阵线宣言号召改组祖国阵线为单一反帝政治组织决议的答复。决议案称：“民主青年联盟将巩固保家利亚青年与苏联、南斯拉夫及其他斯拉夫国家青年的友谊，它将是世界民主青年联盟的积极分子，世界反帝国主义侵略运动的有力部分。并作为争取人民的自由独立、持久和平与真正民主，争取青年更光明的前途的积极战士。该会开幕时，保总理季米特洛夫曾致电祝贺，勉励保国青年反对帝国主义侵略，反对煽动新战争，保卫保加利亚独立自主，向社会主义前进。拥有二十万盟员的保反法西斯战士联盟大会也曾于上月底举行大会，宣布拥护祖国阵线宣言，并表示全力团结一切忠实战士，为反对帝国主义而斗争。
