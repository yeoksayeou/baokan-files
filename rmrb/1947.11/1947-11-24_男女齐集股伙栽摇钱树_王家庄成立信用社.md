　　Men and Women Gather to Plant a Money Tree Together
  　Wangjiazhuang Establishes Credit Cooperative
    [Our paper, Pingshun news] Wangjiazhuang Village, in the Third District of Pingshun, is experiencing a severe famine. This autumn, the average yield is only two dou of coarse grains per mu. Due to consecutive years of famine, the masses have no stored grain, causing widespread worry about how to survive. On the night of October 19th, village cadres and activists met to discuss organizing a credit cooperative to overcome the famine, turning dead money into live money and dead assets into live assets, helping impoverished peasants solve production difficulties. Based on everyone's proposals, the following slogans were put forward: "The credit cooperative is the bank of the masses in our village," "The credit cooperative is our masses' money tree," "Money makes money without difficulty," "The more you invest, the more you earn, with a large principal and high profits." After deliberation, a meeting of poor peasant and farmer-women members was held on the evening of the 21st. Two problems were identified among the masses: first, they disliked that in the past, they only invested without receiving dividends; second, they feared that if they lost money, even their principal would not be guaranteed. It was immediately explained that the credit cooperative was different from a cooperative; it earns profits by lending money out, guaranteeing profit and not being responsible for losses. After resolving these issues, it was decided that shares would be purchased on a per-person basis, with anyone who had money investing, investing whatever they had, investing on whatever day they could, withdrawing on whatever day they needed, and investing as much as they could. At this point, everyone started investing. Quickly, there were 189 male and female members, with a total investment of 403,910 yuan (foreign currency). The masses happily said, "Our village has started a bank!" On the night of the 24th, a mass meeting was held to discuss the interest rates and terms for various loans from the credit cooperative, which were set as follows: 2% interest for demand deposits, 2.5% for time deposits, 2% for agricultural loans, and 3.5% for commercial loans. The principle for loans is to solve difficulties in agricultural and sideline production, as well as agricultural tools, livestock, fertilizer, and seeds. If speculative merchants try to borrow, they will be resolutely denied. In order to expand the capital, 31 laborers and 22 head of livestock were spared from the busy autumn harvest to transport goods to Shexian, a round trip of over 120 li, earning 81,690 yuan (foreign currency) in two days, which was all deposited into the credit cooperative.

　　男女齐集股伙栽摇钱树
  　王家庄成立信用社
    【本报平顺讯】平顺三区王家庄村，灾荒很严重，今秋每亩平均打二斗粗粮，连年灾荒，群众都没存粮，因此群众都愁灾荒无法渡。十月十九日夜，村干部和积极分子会讨论，组织信用社渡荒，由死钱变活钱，死物变活物，帮助翻身贫苦农民解决生产困难。根据大家的圪拉提出以下口号：“信用社就是咱村群众的银行”，“信用社是咱们群众的摇钱树”，“钱赚钱不费难”，“入的多赚的多本大利宽”。经过酝酿，在二十一日晚，召开贫雇和农、妇会员会议，发现群众有两个问题：一、嫌过去光入股不分红。二、入进怕赔了连老本也保不住。当即说明信用社不和合作社一样，信用社是管往外贷款来赚红利，管赚不管赔，把这些问题解决后，议决按人入股，谁有钱谁入股，有什么入什么，那天有那天入，那天用那天抽，有多少入多少。这时大家都入开了，很快即有男女社员一八九名，共入股金洋四○三九一○元。群众高兴的说：“咱们村成立开银行了！”二十四夜，召开群众大会，讨论信用社各种贷款的利息及期限，规定如下：活期存款利息二分，定期存款利息二分五厘，农业贷款利息二分，商业贷款利息三分五。贷款的原则，解决农副业生产和农具、牲口、肥料、种籽等困难。如有投机商人去贷，坚决不贷给他。为了扩大股金，从收耕百忙中，抽出劳力三一名，畜力二二头，往涉县往返一百二十余里运货，两天赚洋八一六九○元，全部入到信用社了。
