　　People's Liberation Army Declaration Soars
    Liu Baiyu
    On October 10th, a certain political commissar, General, of a certain unit of the Democratic Allied Forces on the Central-Chang front, listened to the PLA Declaration, the sixty-seven slogans, and the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention broadcast by the Yan'an Radio Station. The next morning, the mimeographed People's Liberation Army Declaration was distributed to various units, from leadership organs to companies, and cadres and soldiers were eagerly vying to read it aloud. A certain battalion of a certain regiment even held a general assembly of soldiers to explain the text and shout the slogans "Fight to Nanjing! Capture Chiang Kai-shek alive!" Everyone was eager to make contributions. A certain unit's combat newspaper published an article calling for the creation of model units with good mass and class consciousness. The All-Around Model Company immediately responded by launching a "check the plan" movement, re-establishing a plan "to serve the class brothers" under the glorious banner. After the declaration reached the artillery battalion, they treated the sixty-seven slogans as cultural class materials, pasted "Down with Chiang Kai-shek! Establish a New China!" on the cannons, and the slogan "Fight to Nanjing! Capture Chiang Kai-shek alive!" resounded through the clouds during drills every day. When a certain company discussed the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention, Dai Jinglin, an old anti-Japanese warrior from within the passes, said: "In the past, the enemy was strong and we were weak. Our unit had only one donkey per company, and a path a foot wide was enough. Now that we are on a large-scale counter-offensive, our forces are strong, and we have trucks, cars, and artillery, passing over flat ground. We can go wherever we want, and whenever we want, so not damaging crops has become a major discipline." Regarding not trifling with women, he said: The stronger we are, the greater our influence. Today, the large-scale counter-offensive has entered the cities in the Chiang-occupied areas, entered the world of extravagance. We must maintain the glorious tradition of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and not be like "Li Chuang Wang entering Beijing." They discussed while marching, walking seventy or eighty li every day. After arriving at the campsite, they continued to discuss for an hour, and the mood of the entire company became increasingly high. When crossing the Liao River, the ground was already frozen. Thirty-eight commanders and fighters of the entire company went into the water to drag the cannons. The entire battalion did not have a single straggler during the twenty-five-day march. In the study, the Second Company realized that there were still some difficulties in the counter-offensive and discussed several ways to overcome them: (1) Wear new shoes during peacetime and mend old shoes for marching. (2) If horses are injured or killed in battle, use the horses of the cadres to supplement them. If the artillery shell cart cannot be pulled, carry it by manpower. Each person makes a back frame that can carry fifty-five rounds. (3) Mountain warfare may prevent horses from passing, so each person prepares a three-meter rope to pull the cannons. (4) Saddle leather belts are easily damaged during battle. If they break, use your own belts. (5) Implement light equipment preparation. (Xinhua News Agency Northeast Front Electric)

　　人民解放军宣言飞扬
    刘白羽
    十月十日，中长前线民主联军某部政委某将军收听到陕北电台广播之解放军宣言、六十七条口号和三大纪律八项注意，他立即亲自一字一句的纪录下来。第二天一清早，油印的人民解放军宣言便散传到各部队了，从领导机关一直到连队，干部战士都在热烈的争相朗读。某团一营并召开全体军人大会，宣讲本文，并高呼“打到南京去！活捉蒋介石！”的口号，个个磨拳擦掌，准备立功。某部战斗报著文号召创造具有良好群众观念、阶级观念的模范部队。全面模范连立即响应展开“查计划”运动，重新在光荣大旗下订立“为阶级兄弟服务”的计划。宣言传到炮兵营后，他们把六十七条口号当作文化课教材，把“打倒蒋介石！建立新中国！”贴在大炮上，每天上操时“打到南京去！活捉蒋介石！”的口号声更是响彻云霄。一连在讨论三大纪律八项注意时，关内抗日老战士戴景林说：“过去敌强我弱，咱们部队一个连只有一条毛驴，有尺把宽的道路就能走了。现在大反攻，咱们兵力强大，有大车、汽车、大炮，过的都是平地，咱们爱走那儿就走那儿，爱啥时候走就啥时候走，因此不损坏庄稼就成了大纪律。”对于不调戏妇女，他说：咱们力量越大，影响也就越大，今天大反攻进入蒋占区的城市，进入了花花世界，一定要保持毛主席、朱总司令的光荣传统，不能象“李闯王进京”。他们在行军中，边走边讨论，每天走七八十里路，到达宿营地后，还要讨论一个钟头，全连情绪愈来愈高。过辽河时，地上已经结了冰，全连有卅八个指战员下水拖炮，全营在二十五天行军中没有一个掉队的。二连在学习中，认识了大反攻还有若干困难，讨论出几个克服的办法：（一）平时穿新鞋，补好旧鞋行军穿。（二）战斗中马匹若有伤亡，把干部乘马补充，如炮弹车拉不了，就用人力背，每人做一个背架，可背五十五发。（三）山地运动战可能马通不过，每人准备一条三米长的绳子拉炮。（四）战斗时马鞍皮带容易坏，若断了把自己的皮带拿出来用。（五）实行轻装准备。（新华社东北前线电）
