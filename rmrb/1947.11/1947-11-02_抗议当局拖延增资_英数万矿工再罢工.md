    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: London - Labor unrest has erupted again in Britain. Miners in Blantyre, Scotland, began a strike on the 20th to protest the authorities' delay in resolving their wage increase demands. By the 22nd, the strike wave had spread throughout Lanarkshire, with 67 coal pits and 21,500 people participating in the strike in Ayrshire and Dumbartonshire. On the evening of the 26th, 5,000 miners in Wales decided to strike for the same reason. The strike, in Wales alone, will cost Britain 5,000 tons of coal per month. In addition, 400 bus drivers between Victoria, the airline terminus, and Northolt Aerodrome are scheduled to strike at midnight on the 26th to show their sympathy for the porters who went on strike earlier that morning.
