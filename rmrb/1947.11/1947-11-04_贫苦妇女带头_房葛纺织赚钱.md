(Jinan, Hebei, 31st dispatch) In Yuanchao's Fangge Village, poor women are leading the way in textile production, earning more through mutual aid. Li Dong, the director of the village women's association, is a poor woman herself. Under the slogan of "spin more, weave more, earn more," and through individual and collective mobilization, six textile groups were voluntarily formed, totaling thirty-nine people, based on the women's existing mutual aid. After organizing, a textile competition was launched. In just over fifty days, they earned 300,000 yuan. Fang Tongshan and her daughter-in-law earned more than 24,000 yuan, and they also made single garments from thirty-five chi of white cloth. Their capital was accumulated through thrift; each person had two jin of cotton. The cotton spinning was a combination of collective and individual spinning. After spinning the cotton, they exchanged it for thread and wove cloth together. From raw materials to finished products, all expenses were paid from the profits, such as selling cloth, buying cotton, carding cotton, and travel expenses. The exchange of labor for weaving and spinning was: one zhang of cloth exchanged for five liang of cotton. This equalized the labor and made it easy to keep accounts. Now the textile group is more consolidated because collective spinning is faster, the mood is high, it saves lamp oil, and those who know how to weave can help those who don't, so skills can be learned at any time. The profits have solved the women's own clothing difficulties. With the above mutual benefits, three rules were established: First, the group leaders meet every ten days to report on the quality of spinning and weaving, how much money was earned, and how they helped their families, and those who do well are praised. Second, no matter who is wearing clothes, the price per chi of cloth is set according to the market price, so those who save money by wearing old clothes can also save money. Third, regular general meetings of all members are held to review the quality of spinning and weaving, in order to praise and encourage everyone's enthusiasm.

    贫苦妇女带头
    房葛纺织赚钱
    【本报冀南三十一日电】元朝房葛村，贫妇领导纺织，互助赚钱多。该村妇会主任李东，是个贫苦妇女，在多纺多织多赚钱的口号下，经过个别和集体动员，在妇女旧有的互助基础上，自愿结合了六个纺织组，共三十九人。组织起来后，随展开了纺织比赛运动。五十余天就赚洋三十万元。房同善婆媳三人，赚了二万四千余元，还有三十五尺白布做成单衣穿了。她们的资本是从节俭中积起来的；每人二斤花，纺花时是集体纺和各人自纺结合，纺完花就兑线子、伙织布。从原料到成品，一切用费全由红利中报销，如卖布、买花、弹花、路费等。织布和纺花的换工是：织一丈布换五两花。这样用工相等，同时又容易缴帐。现在纺织组更巩固了，原因是集体纺的快，情绪高，又省灯油，会织的能帮助不会织的，技术能随时学习。红利解决了妇女本身穿衣的困难。在以上互有利益下，规定了三条规矩：一是十天组长开会，汇报纺织好坏，赚钱多少，帮助家庭如何，好的给表扬。二是不论何人的穿衣，按市价规定每尺布多少钱，这样省下穿旧衣的，也能省下钱。三是定期召开全体会员大会、检讨纺织好坏，以表扬鼓舞大家情绪。
