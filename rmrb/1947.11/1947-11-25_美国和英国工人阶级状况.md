The working class in the capitalist world greets the International Labor Day in the new post-war conditions. The facts show that even in countries like the United States and Britain, whose territories have not been occupied by enemy forces, the post-war period is linked to huge economic and political crises. Monopoly capital has completely shifted the entire burden of the post-war period onto the shoulders of the laborers.

In the United States and Britain, as a result of the war and demobilization, at one end of society there is a huge increase in wealth, luxury, and parasitism, and at the other end a significant deterioration in material living conditions, increased unemployment, and poverty.

During the war years, the net profits of American monopolists reached 52 billion US dollars. This means that the average annual profit during the war exceeded the average annual profit before the war by more than three times. However, the greed of American monopolists is endless. Their profits during the war years are far behind their profits during the demobilization period. Thus, if the net profit of companies in 1945 reached 9 billion US dollars, then the net profit increased to 12 billion US dollars in 1946, and the expected net profit will increase to 15 billion US dollars in 1947.

The unprecedented increase in profits, in turn, has caused a sharp rise in commodity prices, creating the threat of inflation. According to Wall Street materials, food prices rose by more than 15 percent in 1946 alone. The Workers' Statistics Bureau calculated that the retail price index, compared with the average index of 1935-1939, was 188 at the end of 1946, 35 percent higher than the 1945 index.

The Advisory Committee of the Mobilization and Demobilization Bureau pointed out at the end of 1946: "If the evil forces of inflation" are not brought under control, then countless domestic difficulties will occur, which will have a negative impact on the world economy. However, the monopolists still did whatever they wanted, price controls were lifted, prices soared, and the actual value of the dollar fell. The United States Department of Labor's Labor Statistics Bureau published a report earlier this year, from which it can be seen that if 1940 is taken as 100, then the actual value of the dollar in September 1946 was 68.5 cents. Since then, there has been a greater drop in the actual value of the dollar.

Even official figures cannot hide their growing fears. Recently, the US President admitted that if very high prices are maintained, then this "will unconditionally affect decline or depression." He said: The formula for raising prices "was tested after the First World War. And we are paying the price for this."

The huge increase in domestic prices and the process of inflation put a heavy burden on the shoulders of the American working class. It should be pointed out that the economic situation of American workers was very difficult before the war. The famous economist Jürgen Kuczynski said in his book "A Brief History of the American Working Class from 1789 to the Present": According to the materials of the Labor Research Association, the actual wages of American workers in 1940 were only 55 percent of the minimum necessary budget.

Kuczynski wrote that the majority of American workers "did not earn wages that allowed them to live. Considering that American workers are considered the best-paid workers in the capitalist world, this is a fatal verdict not only on American conditions, but also on the existing conditions of the entire capitalist world."

Kuczynski's conclusion finds its full evidence even today. The US Senate recently released some materials, from which it can be clearly seen that a middle-class worker family of four living in the city cannot make ends meet with a monthly salary of 200 US dollars. But the problem is that more than 80 percent of American workers earn much less than this amount. On the other hand, the continuous increase in prices has led to a drop in real wages. At this time, the shadow of unemployment appeared almost on the doorstep of every country.

Although the officialdom tried its best to avoid it, the number of unemployed people is growing. According to the materials of the Bureau of Commerce Statistics, there were 2.5 million unemployed people in the United States in January 1947. However, the Bureau added that this number does not include 1.6 million demobilized soldiers who did not have jobs. On the other hand, it should be considered that in 1946, 1.09 million people worked one to fourteen hours per week, and 5.6 million people worked fifteen to thirty-four hours per week. From this, "Economist Record" reported that the actual number of unemployed people at the beginning of 1947 was 5.7 million.

American monopoly capital is attacking the positions of the working class at an accelerated pace on a broad front. They intend to give as fierce a blow as possible before the arrival of the economic crisis, and to deepen the disintegration of the ranks of the working class as much as possible.

The activities of the new US Congress prove the scale and intensity of this attack. Two hundred and twelve anti-worker bills are now under review by this Congress. The House of Representatives recently passed a reactionary bill that sharply restricts the rights of the working class. What is the main content of the passed bill? First, it prohibits trade unions from adopting the "closed shop" system, that is, only union members are allowed to work; it prohibits the conclusion of collective contracts according to the entire industrial sector, and prohibits strikes by or instigation of state employees. The bill in fact prohibits American communists from actively working in trade unions.

How does the American working class respond to the attack of monopoly capital? From 1935 to 1939, there were 2,736 strikes annually, involving more than one million workers, and the lost working days reached 16 million. In 1945, there were 4,616 strikes, involving about 3.5 million people, and the total number of lost working days exceeded 30 million. In 1946, there were 4,985 strikes, involving about 7 million workers, and the lost working days reached 116 million.

These materials show that the strike movement is taking on a very large and growing scale, and the domestic situation in the United States is becoming increasingly tense.

　　　　　★　　　　　★　　　　★　　　　★　　　　　★

Not long ago, when analyzing the most acute economic difficulties experienced by Britain, Blackaben, a Labour Party member of the House of Commons, concluded that the country was in great trouble. He emphasized: "This is not pessimism, but realism." Then, the following question naturally arises: What kind of economic policy does the British ruling group rely on to resist the coming disaster? On whose shoulders does the burden of the cost of the crisis and the policies associated with it fall? To answer this question, let us first cite the materials on the distribution of domestic property.

In 1936, 7 percent of the British population owned 85 percent of the country's total private capital. In 1944, the British professor Hilton's book "The Poor and the Rich," published in London, made interesting statistics on this issue. Hilton estimated that the property held in private hands in Britain was 20 billion pounds. At the same time, it was stated that out of a total of 12 million households, if 4 million households sold everything they owned, cashed in their insurance policies at appropriate prices, and repaid their debts, the total amount of "money that could be taken out" would only reach 100 pounds, while another 4 million households had "nothing left." Thus, in the total amount of property held in private hands, almost two-thirds of British families had almost nothing.

Jürgen Kuczynski wrote in his "A Brief History of the British Empire Working Class from 1750 to the Present": Before the war, there were one million workers and their families in Britain who did not have the so-called "minimum ration," that is, not enough information to maintain their health at the level required by daily labor. These included 75 percent of miners, 50 percent of construction workers, 46 percent of textile workers, and 100 percent of agricultural workers.

The war caused a sharp deterioration in the economic situation of the laborers and a huge increase in the wealth of the monopolists. Kuczynski concluded his study by saying: "The gap between the two nations, between the poor and the rich, between millionaires and small property owners, between the people and the ruling class, has greatly widened in Britain." It is on the shoulders of the British working class that all the difficulties suffered by the country have been placed.

The Labour Party's economic policy has not made any substantial changes in this regard. In addition, if we consider some recent "programmatic" statements by individual Labour Party leaders, we can conclude that there will be no serious changes in the future. Morrison's speech in Birmingham at the end of 1946 was, in fact, nothing more than an appeal to British monopoly capital, calling on them to act without scruples according to their usual practices. In this speech, he "declared" that Labour Party members were not prepared to abolish the "profit principle," but only to strive to make profits serve the "common good."

The experience of nationalization of the coal industry is the most powerful explanation of how this "combination" of capitalist profits and "common" interests is manifested in practical life. The British people had to spend 229 million pounds for the nationalization of the coal industry. This includes the payment of a certain amount of profits, which the mine owners could have obtained for a certain period if there had been no nationalization. In this way, the mine owners were guaranteed an average pre-war profit of 12 million pounds per year, a number so large that everyone knows it is guaranteed by the incomparably low wages of the miners.

In this way, coal owners get insured profit income. But what did the miners get? Increasingly deteriorating labor conditions and living conditions, and wages extremely lagging behind other industrial sectors (almost twice as much). As a result of the economic difficulties unfolding in Britain, the number of unemployed people has recently increased to 2.5 million.

Other British economists deny the possibility of mass unemployment in Britain. However, these optimistic statements contradict certain realistic facts and trends in the British economy. For example, everyone knows that the work of the coal industry in 1947 is still far behind the original plan. And for major industrial sectors, a lack of every 5 million tons of coal can cause a threat of creating an unemployment army of more than 1 million people. A fairly large threat of labor outflow has occurred in Britain. According to materials published in the Daily Mail, more than 500,000 British people have migrated out of Britain. The newspaper wrote: This is "the largest wave of emigration in British history," which "puts the country in crisis."

Britain's economic difficulties in recent years have been accompanied by the fever of inflation. All the burdens of the disease fall on the working class.

  　　★　　　　　　★　　　　　　★　　　　　★　　　　　　★

It's been like this for a long time! In times of acute crisis, bourgeois sociologists appear with programs of sweeping social reforms and resounding promises. This also happened during the years of World War II, when many British and American commentators began to proclaim that a new era of "total busyness" and "total prosperity" would arrive after the war.

The time has come to cash the checks generously issued by bourgeois sociologists and politicians. Why are the pastoral "de-capitalization" slogans not issued as loudly today as they were not long ago? Where have their bragging programs and exaggerated declarations gone? Unfortunately, the capitalist economy is far from completing its transition from a war track to a peaceful track, so yesterday's predictions of "total prosperity" today begin to deny themselves and eat their own "theories." And even the leader of modern bourgeois economists, Sir Keynes, wrote in his last thesis published in London in June 1946: In the current era characterized by "constant change," "no plan can be confidently realized...".

Such is the natural logic of attempts to conceal the true essence of capitalism with empty talk about a "new century" and "total prosperity."

The modern British and American bourgeois system looks like a pyramid, its foundation is poverty, and the top is decorated with diamonds and gold.

　　美国和英国工人阶级状况
    马里宁  李何译
    资本主义世界的工人阶级，在新的战后条件下迎接五一国际劳动节。事实表明，甚至在美国和英国那样领土没有遭受敌军占领过的国家里，战后时期是同巨大的经济危机和政治危机联结的。独占资本把战后时间的全部重担，完全推在劳动者肩上。
    在美国和英国，由于战争和复员的结果，在社会的一端是财富、奢侈和寄生的巨大增长，另一端是物质生活条件的大大恶化、失业和贫困的增长。
    在战争年份里，美国独占者的纯利达五百二十万万美元。这就是说，战时平均每年利润超过战前平均每年利润三倍有余。可是美国独占者的贪欲是无止境的。它们在战争时期的利润远落在复员时期利润之后。这样，如果在一九四五年公司的纯利达九十万万美元，那么在一九四六年纯利提高到一百二十万万美元，而在一九四七年预期纯利将增加到一百五十万万美元。
    利润的空前增长，反过来使商品的价格大涨，它造成通货膨胀的威胁。根据华尔街材料，在一九四六年一年当中食物价格升高了百分之十五以上。工人统计局计算，零售物价指数，与一九三五——一九三九年平均指数比较，一九四六年底为一八八，比一九四五年指数高百分之三十五。
    动员与复员局的顾问委员会于一九四六年末指出：“如果通货膨胀的恶势力”不放在管制底下，那么国内无数困难将会发生，这些困难将给予世界经济以不良影响。然而独占者仍然为所欲为，物价管制被取消了，物价扶摇直上，美元的实际价值下降了。美国劳工部劳动统计局今年初发表了报告，由这个报告中可以看出：如果以一九四○年为一百，那么一九四六年九月美元的实际价值为六八．五分。从那时起，发生了美元实际价值的更大跌落。
    甚至官方人物也不能掩盖其增长着的恐惧。最近美国总统承认，如果保持非常高的物价，那么，这“无条件的会影响衰落或萧条”。他说：抬高价格的公式，“第一次世界大战之后曾经考验过。而我们正吃了这个亏。”
    国内物价的巨大增长和通货膨胀的过程，把沉重的负担压到美国工人阶级的双肩。应当指出：美国工人的经济状况战前是非常困难的。著名经济学者尤尔根·库青斯基在其所著的“从一七八九年到现在美国工人状况简史”一书中说：按照劳动研究会材料，美国工人的实际工资，在一九四○年仅为起码必需的预算之百分之五十五。
    库青斯基写道，美国工人的大多数“没有收入过使他们生活得可以的工资。如果考虑到美国工人是被认为资本主义世界里报酬最厚的工人，那么这是不仅对美国条件，而且，对全部资本主义世界现存条件的致命判决。”
    库青斯基的结论就在今天也找到其充分的证据。美国参议院不久前传出一些材料，从这些材料可以了然：住在城市的有四口的中等工人家庭，月资二百美元还不能渡日。可是问题还在于百分之八十以上的美国工人，它们所收入的比这个数目还少得多。另一方面，物价的不断增长，招致了实际工资的跌落。在这个时候，几乎在每一国家门槛上都出现了失业的阴影。
    官方虽百般忌讳，但大批的失业者增长着。根据商务部统计局的材料，一九四七年一月在美国计有二百五十万失业者。可是该局补充指出：这个数目不包括没有工做的一百六十万复员军人。另一方面，应当考虑到，在一九四六年每周工作一个钟头到十四个钟头的计有一百零九万人，每周工作十五个钟头到三十四个钟头的计有五百六十万人。由此，“经济家记录”汇报确定一九四七年初实际失业者数目为五百七十万人。
    美国独占资本在广阔阵线上以加强的速度向工人阶级阵地进攻。它们打算在经济危机到来前给以尽可能更猛烈的打击，并尽可能加深瓦解工人阶级的队伍。
    美国新国会的活动证明了这种进攻的规模和强度，二百一十二件反工人的法案现在正在这个国会的审查下。众议院最近通过了尖锐限制工人阶级权利的反动法案。被通过的法案之主要内容是什么呢？首先它禁止职工会采取“关闭的行会”制度，这就是只有工会会员才准许工作的制度；它禁止按整个工业部门来订立集体合同，禁止进行或鼓动国家雇员的罢工。法案事实上禁止美国共产党员在职工会中进行积极工作。
    美国工人阶级怎样回答独占资本的进攻呢？从一九三五年到一九三九年间，每年罢工二千七百三十六次，参加了一百万以上的工人，损失的工作日数达一千六百万个。在一九四五年，罢工四千六百十六次，参加了约三百五十万人，损失的工作日总数超过三千万个。在一九四六年，罢工四千九百八十五次，参加了约七百万工人，损失的工作日数达一万一千六百万个。
    这些材料说明着：罢工运动采取着非常巨大和日益增长的规模，美国国内情况已日益紧张起来。
    　　　　　★　　　　　★　　　　★　　　　★　　　　　★
    不久前，在分析英国所经历的最尖锐的经济困难时，下院议员工党党员布列克奔断定说，国家大难临头。他强调说：“这不是悲观论，而是现实论。”接着自然提出了如下的问题：英国统治集团依靠怎样的经济政策，以力阻来临的大难呢？经历着的危机的耗费以及与此关联的政策，所采取的措施之重担，落在那个阶级的肩上呢？为了答复这个问题，我们首先来引用关于国内财产分配的材料。
    一九三六年，英国人口百分之七占有国家全部私有资本的百分之八十五。一九四四年，伦敦出版的英国教授喜尔顿所著的“穷人和富翁”一书中，关于这个问题作了有趣的统计。喜尔顿估价握在英国私人手里的财产，有二百万万英镑。同时说明，从一千二百万户的总数中，四百万户如果卖掉他们所有的一切，按适当价格兑现了自己的保险券，付还了债，能够“掏出来的钱”总数仅达一百英镑，而另四百万户“身外无余物”。这样，握在私人手里的财产总数中，英国三分之二家庭几乎一无所有。
    尤尔根·库青斯基在其“从一七五○年到今日的不列颠帝国工人阶级情况简史”一书中写道：战前在英国计有一百万工人及其家属，他们没有所谓“最低限度的口粮”，也即没有每日劳动的人所必须的水平上保持自己健康的足够资料。其中包括百分之七十五的矿工，百分之五十的建筑工人，百分之四十六的纺织工人，百分之百的农业工人。
    战争引起了劳动者经济状况的尖锐恶化，和独占者财富的巨大增长。库青斯基总结自己的研究说：“两个民族之间，穷人和富人之间，百万富翁和小有产者之间，人民和统治阶级之间的鸿沟，在英国非常扩大了。”正是在英国工人阶级的肩膀上，放了国家所遭受的一切困难。
    工党的经济政策在这上面没有作什么实质的改变。此外，如果考虑到个别工党领袖不久前的某些“纲领式”声明，那么可以得出结论说：将来也不会有严重的变化。摩里逊于一九四六年底在伯明罕发表的演说，实际上，不是别的，而是对英国独占资本的号召，号召他们按照自己的惯例，无顾忌地行事。在这篇演说里，他“宣布了”工党党员不准备取消“利润原则”，仅仅努力使利润服务于“共同利益”。
    关于怎样在实际生活中表现这种资本主义利润与“共同”利益的“结合”，煤工业国有化经验是最有力的说明。英国人民为了煤工业国有化，得花二万二千九百万英镑。这里包括一定数目的利润的付偿，这种利润，如果没有国有化的话，矿主是可以在一定的期间获得的。这样，矿主被保证有平均战前每年总数一千二百万英镑的利润，数目这样大，大家都知道，是由矿工工资无比之低的情况来保证的。
    这样，煤业主获得保险的利润进款。但矿工们获得了什么呢？日益恶化的劳动条件和生活条件，以及工资比之其他工业部门的极端落后（几乎差两倍）。由于在英国展开着的经济困难的结果，最近几个月间失业者数目增加到二百五十万人。
    别的英国经济学者否认在英国大批失业的可能性。然而这些乐观主义的声明与某些现实的事实和英国经济的趋向相矛盾的。例如，大家都知道，一九四七年煤工业的工作还大大落后于原定的计划。而对于主要工业部门，每五百万吨煤的缺乏，就可以引起造成一百万人以上失业军的威胁。在英国发生了颇大的劳动力外移的威胁。据每日邮报发表的材料，五十万以上的英国人从英国迁移出去。该报写道：这是“英国历史上最大的外移浪潮”，它“陷国家于危机中”。
    英国的经济困难近年伴随着通货膨胀的热病。病状的一切重担，都落在工人阶级身上了。
  　　★　　　　　　★　　　　　　★　　　　　★　　　　　　★
    早就这样弄惯了！在尖锐的危机时期中，资产阶级的社会学家带着包罗万象的社会改良和响亮诺言的纲领出场了。在第二次世界大战的年份中，也这样发生过，当时英美许多评论家开始宣扬说，战后“总忙碌”和“总繁荣”的新时代将会到来。
    要资产阶级社会学家和政治家所慷慨发出的支票兑现的时期到来了。为什么今天不象不久前那样响亮地发出田园诗人的“非资本主义化”的呼声呢？他们的吹牛纲领和夸大宣言到那里去了？不幸，资本主义经济远不能完成其从战争轨道到和平轨道的转变，所以昨天“总繁荣”的预言今天开始否认自己，自食其“理论”。而甚至现代派资产阶级经济学者的领班凯因斯爵士，在其一九四六年六月发表伦敦的临终论文中写道：在以“不断变化”为特色的现时代，“没有一个计划可以有信心地实现……”。
    以关于“新世纪”和“总繁荣”的虚谈来掩盖资本主义真正实质的企图之自然逻辑便是如此。
    英美现代资产阶级制度，看起来象金字塔一样，它的基础是贫穷，而塔顶却装饰着钻石和金子。
