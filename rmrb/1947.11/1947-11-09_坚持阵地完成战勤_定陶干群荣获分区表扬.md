[This article comes] from our newspaper's Hebei-Shandong-Henan [Bureau] dispatch of the 7th. The cadres and masses of Dingtao County in the Fifth Sub-district, in the midst of frequent seesaw battles, consistently held their positions and completed arduous war support tasks, receiving commendation from the sub-district. The cadres and masses of the county, beginning from July 20th, in the face of the enemy's Luo Guangwen Group and over ten divisions and regiments engaging in thirteen serious seesaw battles, held their positions in very small gaps. Many models of persistent struggle against the enemy emerged. For example, the West Small District of Ran＠ engaged in sparrow warfare with the enemy within sorghum fields, deterring sporadic enemy personnel from activity. Cadres in Chenji District, with fourteen people, repelled forty local bandits and seized over a thousand pieces of clothing belonging to our army. The Menghai District transported three large carts of ammunition near Menghaiji. The entire county also accommodated over three hundred wounded soldiers. The greatest achievement was that, by holding the region, the morale of the masses was stabilized, laying the foundation for completing war support tasks. Dingtao was able to cope with this difficult situation, persist in holding positions, and struggle against the enemy. The main experiences are as follows: First, adopting the reliance on green sorghum fields and tunnels, and establishing the principle among cadres that "dispersed persistence is not for death, but for survival;" Second, the leadership should pay attention to gathering information, judging the enemy's situation, and seizing opportunities to penetrate behind enemy lines; this requires courage and determination; Third, discipline must be emphasized for individual cadres who cannot persist. During the enemy's back-and-forth movements, the county completed temporary war support tasks and war support tasks during the Shatuji battle. During this period, the entire population was mobilized, providing a total of × 10,000 catties of noodles, × 1,000 stretchers, × 1,000 catties of oil, and × 10,000 pairs of shoes, and undertaking temporary support for the stationed troops and caring for the wounded. Women launched a "one pair of shoes per person" movement, ensuring that all able-bodied men and women participated in the war. Women, children, and other semi-labor forces were organized to support production. Because this task was completed in a timely manner, it was commended by the Fifth Sub-district War Support Command and received a special award.
