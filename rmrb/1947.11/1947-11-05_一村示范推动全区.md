    One Village Demonstrates, Driving the Entire District
    [Report from Lucheng by our newspaper] After twenty days of intensive sod-turning, Weizi Town in the Second District has victoriously completed turning over all 3,799.7 mu of autumn land. To promote the accelerated completion of autumn sod-turning throughout the entire district, so that not a single field is left with stubble this year, and no stubble remains, the leaders of the Second District noted that Weizi Town has already achieved this and created considerable experience. In order to promote the experience of Weizi Town to all villages, the leadership specifically convened a meeting of village cadres on the fifth and sixth days of the ninth lunar month. On the last day of sod-turning in Weizi Town, everyone collectively visited the fields in the village. The leadership used this realistic situation to conduct analysis and further explain the benefits of autumn sod-turning, allowing the village cadres to conduct group discussions, once again breaking the complacent thinking that "the old liberated areas have no problems." All villages re-revised their plans, all saying: "Weizi Town fired the first shot; we will go back and strive to fire the second shot." (Tuchang, Buliu, Liukuan, Guangyan, Zhuhai, Sanping)

    一村示范推动全区
    【本报潞城讯】二区微子镇经过了廿天抢垡，全村三千七百九十九亩七分秋地全部胜利垡完，二区领导上为推动全区秋垡地加速完成，是今年不留一块茬地和一个茬存在，微子镇已做到这点，并创造出不少经验。领导上为把这个微子镇的经验推广到各村，特于阴历九月初五、六两日召开各村干部会，在微子镇垡地最后一天，集体到该村地里进行参观。领导上即用这种现实情况进行了分析并再次说明秋垡地的好处，让村干部分组讨论，再次打破“老区不成问题”的自满思想，各村都重订了计划，都说：“微子镇打响了第一炮，咱要回去争取打响第二炮”。（土长、不流、流宽、光炎、珠孩、三平）
