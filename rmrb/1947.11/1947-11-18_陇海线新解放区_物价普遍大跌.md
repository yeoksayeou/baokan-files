　　New Liberated Areas Along the Longhai Railway
    Commodity Prices Generally Plummet
    [Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Jiangsu-Shandong-Henan-Anhui, 15th] In the newly liberated 500-li area along the Xuzhou-Lanzhou section of the Longhai Railway, grain prices have fallen. In places like Yucheng, Xiayi, and Dangshan, the price of sorghum has dropped from 30,000 Jiang currency per dou to 20,000, and wheat has fallen from 55,000 to 40,000. Other commodity prices have also generally decreased.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th] According to a Reuters report from Shanghai on the 14th, the Jiang currency continues to depreciate. The black market exchange rate for the US dollar closed at between 88,000 and 90,000 on the 13th, and opened at between 97,000 and 99,000 on the morning of the 14th. Reuters called this a "horrifying devaluation" of the Jiang currency, and said that one of the main reasons was "the news of the military defeats of the Jiang bandits."

　　陇海线新解放区
    物价普遍大跌
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线十五日电】新解放之陇海路徐兰段沿线五百里地区粮价下跌，虞城、夏邑、砀山等地高粱由蒋币三万元一斗跌至二万元，小麦由五万五千元跌至四万元，其他物价亦普遍下跌。
    【新华社陕北十五日电】据路透社上海十四日消息，蒋币继续贬值，美金黑市汇价十三日收盘尚在八万八千至九万元之间，十四日晨开盘即在九万七千到九万九千元之间。路透社将此称为蒋币的“骇人听闻的贬值”，并说其主要原因之一是蒋匪“军事失利的消息。”
