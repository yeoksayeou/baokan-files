Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 10th: The Northeast Administrative Committee convened the Northeast Liberated Area Financial and Economic Conference on August 11th, which concluded successfully in late September. The entire conference was guided by a central spirit: discussing how to strengthen the unified leadership of financial and economic work in the Northeast, highly mobilize, organize, and develop the manpower, material resources, and financial resources of the entire Northeast Liberated Area, develop the New Democratic economy, and actively support the people's liberation war in the Northeast and throughout the country. More than 100 people attended the meeting, including the chairmen of various provinces, heads of financial and construction departments, commissioners, and responsible comrades from the financial, trade, taxation, and transportation systems. On the 18th, Comrade Li Fuchun delivered a report on behalf of the Northeast Bureau. On September 1st, Wang Shoudao and Ye Jizhuang, responsible persons of the Northeast Financial and Economic Office, made important speeches. On the 3rd, Li Fuchun made a summary. Subsequently, representatives from various provinces, based on the general principles and tasks adopted by the conference, formulated economic construction plans and financial plans for 1948, and determined the specific tasks for each province.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 10th: The Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a decision on strengthening financial and economic work on October 10th. The decision stated: Due to the increasing development of the national liberation war situation and the increasing military needs of large-scale wars, and also due to the relatively superior economic conditions of the Northeast Liberated Area and the mass movements that have been launched, the base areas have been established. The Northeast Liberated Area should develop a New Democratic economy with planning, and undertake the great task of supporting the people's liberation war in the Northeast and throughout the country. Therefore, after the basic completion of land reform in the Northeast Liberated Area, economic work has become a top priority. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of production and financial work, to shift from decentralization to unification, to implement the guidelines of developing the economy, supporting the war, relying on the masses, taking into account both military and civilian needs, unified planning, division of labor and responsibility, precise calculation, and forming a whole. The whole Party must correct all erroneous views incompatible with this guideline, strive for rapid transformation, strive to develop agriculture with agriculture as the mainstay, develop industry, and ensure the realization of financial plans for government revenue and local production self-sufficiency. Therefore, the following decisions are made:

	(1) Approve the economic development plan for 1948 in the basic areas of the Northeast Liberated Area formulated by the Third Financial and Economic Conference. Each province should also formulate its own economic construction plan for 1948 based on this plan, strengthen the development of public enterprises and support the development of private enterprises, mobilize various rural areas, factories, mines, railway transportation departments, public and private enterprises, and rear organs, troops, and schools to formulate their own production plans, organize millions of people and all personnel in the rear to increase labor enthusiasm, carry out revolutionary competitions, launch merit-making campaigns, and strive to complete and exceed these plans, and strive to develop the New Democratic economy.

	(2) Approve the financial plan for 1948 of the Third Financial and Economic Conference. Each province and county should also formulate a financial plan and budget for 1948. Party committees at all levels must guide Party, government, military, and civilian organs and troops to conscientiously implement financial policies, abide by government laws and regulations, the establishment and budget final accounts system, implement precise calculations, eliminate decentralized, disorganized, independent, irresponsible, and wasteful situations.

	(3) Party organizations at all levels need to transfer appropriate cadres to strengthen financial and economic work and urban work, especially to make financial and economic work cadres recognize the importance of economic work in the Northeast, master their business, learn technology, study management methods, continuously improve their work, conscientiously strive for the economic cause of the people, and systematically train a large number of new financial and economic work cadres to meet the growing needs.

	(4) In financial and economic departments, it is necessary to strengthen Party life, strengthen class education, policy education, and business education, launch criticism and self-criticism, correct departmentalism tendencies, eliminate corruption and waste, and develop a pragmatic style of striving for progress and wholeheartedly serving the people and the liberation war.

    【新华社东北十日电】中共中央东北局于十月十日颁发关于加强财经工作的决定。该决定称：由于全国解放战争形势的日益发展，大规模战争的军需日益增加，再由于东北解放区经济条件的比较优越，群众运动已经发动，根据地已经建立起来，东北解放区应当带计划性的发展新民主主义经济，担负起支援东北及全国人民解放战争的巨大任务。因此东北解放区在土地改革基本完成之后，经济工作就成为一等重要的工作。因此就必需加强对生产与财政工作的领导，要由分散转到统一，要贯彻发展经济、支援战争、依靠群众、军民兼顾、统一筹划、分工负责、精密计算、结成整体的方针，全党必须纠正与此方针不相容的一切错误观点，争取迅速的转变，争取以农业为主发展农业、发展工业，及确保政府财源、争取地方生产自给的财经计划的实现。因此特作下列的决定：
    （一）批准第三次财经会议所制定的东北解放区基本地区一九四八年的发展经济计划，各省并应根据此计划制定各省一九四八年的经建计划，加强公营企业与扶助私人企业的发展，动员各农村、各工厂、各矿山、各铁路交通部门、各公私企业及后方各机关部队学校，制定自己生产计划，组织千百万人民及后方一切人员提高劳动热忱，进行革命竞赛，展开立功运动，为完成与超过这些计划，为发展新民主主义经济而努力。
    （二）批准第三次财经会议一九四八年的财政计划，各省各县亦应定出一九四八年的财政计划与预算，各级党委必须指导党政军民各机关各部队，认真执行财政政策，遵守政府的法令、编制与预算决算制度，实行精密计算，肃清分散零乱、各自为政、不负责任与浮支浪费的状态。
    （三）各级党需调适当干部去加强财经工作及城市工作，特别要使财经工作干部认识东北经济工作的重要性，掌握业务，学习技术，研究管理方法，不断的改进工作，认真的为人民的经济事业而努力，并有计划的培养大批财经工作的新干部，以适应日益扩大的需要。
    （四）在财经部门中要严密党的生活，加强阶级教育、政策教育与业务教育，展开批评与自我批评，纠正本位主义倾向，肃清贪污腐化行为，养成奋发有为全心全意为人民与解放战争服务的朴实作风。
