Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, October 31st: Late-arriving news: Frontline reporters report: The Baoding-North blocking battle started on the 16th and ended on the 22nd after seven days and seven nights of intense fighting. The People's Liberation Army initially blocked five regiments of Chiang's bandits cobbled together to reinforce Xushui from the south on the Gucheng-Xushui line, preventing them from crossing our strong defense zone and inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy, thus ensuring the smooth completion of the annihilation battle near Qingfengdian. On the morning of the 16th, five regiments of Chiang's direct line 94th Army's 5th Division, 121st Division, and the 95th Division directly under the Baoding Pacification Headquarters, supported by more than 20 mountain guns, field guns, and howitzers, and under the cover of nine tanks and four aircraft, repeatedly charged at us four times, but were all repelled. Three enemy tanks were destroyed and three were damaged. On the 19th, Li Wen, commander of Chiang's 34th Army Group, personally took charge, concentrating four regiments and carrying forty to fifty trucks, launching a fierce attack on our position, but also failed. On the 20th, a certain unit of our army south of Xushui held its position, repelling five charges by an enemy force twenty times its size, eliminating several hundred enemy soldiers. By the morning of the 22nd, when four regiments including the 7th Division of the enemy's Third Army were annihilated at Qingfengdian, the Chiang's bandits reinforcing from the south had advanced less than eight *li* per day.
