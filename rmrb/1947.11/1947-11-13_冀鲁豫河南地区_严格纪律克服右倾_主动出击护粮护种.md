　　【This Newspaper Hebei-Luyu 10th dispatch】Actively unfolding military struggle, overcoming right-leaning thoughts, the 7th sub-district has stabilized the situation initially and laid the foundation for upholding guerrilla warfare through 20 days of heroic fighting. Since the enemy blockaded the Grand Canal and occupied Xiaopikou, Jimiao, Liangshan, and Liangbaosi, serious right-leaning thoughts and temporary organizational chaos occurred among the cadres and armed forces of Dongping and other counties. Individual regional county brigades and cadres even retreated across the Yellow River, causing significant damage to the work. The leadership first realized that the serious situation in the 7th sub-district was not due to the enemy's strength, but to right-leaning thoughts. If these were not overcome immediately, the future situation would be difficult to manage. Therefore, it was decided to first rectify thinking. Besides making a correct analysis and understanding of the situation, strict discipline was enforced. The leadership also took the lead in actively launching military struggles, praising those who persisted in the struggle to establish models, and severely criticizing those who retreated. In the command of military struggles, bold actions were taken to penetrate deep into enemy areas, approach the enemy, and launch long-distance raids. Wherever the sub-district armed forces operated, they took responsibility for that area, resolutely taking the three brigades east of the Grand Canal and victoriously breaking through the enemy's blockade line. In military activities, in 20 days, our sub-district's ×× unit operated in about 12 districts across three counties, engaging in a total of 11 battles, annihilating and capturing approximately 300 enemy and puppet troops, including three annihilating blows to the enemy. Under such active military struggle, 10 districts were recovered, and the enemy's arrogance was struck, causing the enemy's regular army units of a company or less to dare not move out easily. As a result, the fighting confidence of our troops was enhanced, the morale of the cadres was stabilized, and a wave of autumn harvest and wheat planting was set off among the masses. At present, in general areas, wheat planting has reached more than one-half of the cultivated land, and in most areas, two-thirds has been achieved. In local work, the three counties on both sides of the Grand Canal summarized the previous stage of guerrilla warfare, evaluated merits and demerits, and praised the model of persisting in guerrilla warfare in the 3rd and 5th districts of the south bank, and praised the armed struggle of the Kungshan 2nd district armed work team, who had fought against a battalion of "Returning Home Corps" and achieved victory. A large number of model cadres have emerged in various counties, discipline has been strictly enforced, and ideologically the back door to cross the Yellow River has been blocked. The policy of killing the enemy and carrying out land reform has been universally affirmed and implemented, and a revolutionary competition against the enemy has been launched. In Dongping County, each district, within a month, totaled 19 battles of various sizes, killing and wounding 15 enemies (including one platoon leader), capturing 14 enemies (including one adjutant and two spies), seizing nine rifles, four warhorses, and intercepting 2,500 catties of wheat. In helping the masses with the autumn harvest and wheat planting, various organs and units of the sub-district have been working for more than ten days. Current statistics show that they have helped plant 326 mu of wheat. As a result of 20 days of intense activity and struggle, the situation has been initially stabilized. The area is now actively carrying out the struggle against the enemy, combining the "three investigations" [likely refers to investigation of class origin, work performance, and will to fight], and conducting in-depth investigations and research on land reform to lay a solid foundation for the victory of persisting in guerrilla warfare.
    【This Newspaper Hebei-Luyu 10th dispatch】In order to protect the autumn grain and wheat planting, the local armed forces and local militia in the guerrilla areas of Henan Province often take the initiative to strike at the enemy. The city of Juye is home to the bandit army of Wu Ni Huawen, which often comes out to harass, go to Jubei to rob things, capture men, pull cattle, and disrupt wheat planting. The county security team and the Pengze district team cooperated with the local work team and the militia to conduct guerrilla warfare in the villages often visited by the enemy. On the 10th of last month, they raided Wolong Bridge at night. According to migrant workers who escaped from the city, the enemy was extremely panicked after hearing the gunshots, drove all the migrant workers into the temple, deployed all five regiments, and did not sleep all night, all thinking that it was our main force attacking the city. Also, on the 12th of last month, they repelled a company of Zhanggan's enemy who came to harass 18 miles away from the city, and the enemy's loaded carts were also intercepted, and the stolen goods and grain were returned to the masses, thus further enhancing the mass base for fighting the enemy. On the 9th of last month, more than 200 people from the enemy's 2nd district office came to Wu Miao and Li Luji area of Linze 6th district to rob grain. The 6th district armed work team, upon hearing the news, ran from four miles away and engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy for half an hour. The enemy occupying Wu Miao could not hold out and fled south. In this battle, the enemy was wounded three times, and not a single grain was robbed, and we had no casualties. That afternoon, the enemy's 2nd district office gathered all the bandits and came to our Wu Miao again to rob grain, attempting to retaliate, but as soon as our gunshots rang out, the enemy ran even faster than in the morning, and again failed to rob. On the 10th, the enemy came out to Houji, attempting to rob grain, and our 6th district armed work team drove them back again. The masses in the Houji area were very happy and said: "If it weren't for our team coming, I don't know how much of the wheat seeds in these villages would have been robbed by the bastards!" From the 9th to the 15th of last month, for six days, the stubborn bandits and "Returning Home Corps" of Changyuan went to the 5th and 7th districts of Hua County three times to kill, set fires, and rob things, and the masses' wheat planting was also affected. According to this situation, the county headquarters immediately organized the elite militia of each district into a brigade, and organized a flying demolition team of ×× people, led by Chief of Staff Wang, to be active in the Dingluan and Shaqiu area, so that the enemy dare not come out. Now, under the cover of the masses in each village, the autumn harvest and wheat planting are almost completed, and each village has organized a joint defense; changing the terrain of the villages, the self-defense team stands guard and patrols every night. The masses in Nanhugu and Nanxinzhuang villages in the 6th district, in order to protect their property and wheat planting, organized a joint defense, changing the terrain of the villages. At present, the village has planted more than 65% of the wheat. Landmines have been buried around the village, and the village cadres and militia all say: "If the enemy comes to our village, we must show them some color!" The morale of the masses in these two villages is very high, and they are continuing to rush to plant wheat.
