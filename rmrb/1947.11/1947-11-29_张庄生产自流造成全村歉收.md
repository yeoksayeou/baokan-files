(Taiyue Dispatch, 27th) It was recently discovered in Fushan that cadres in Zhangzhuang administrative village relaxed leadership over production, leading to village-wide crop failure and resulting in famine. Zhangzhuang administrative village includes seven natural villages: Zuocun, Songjiazhuangzi, Dongnanpo, Xinanpo, Zhongnanpo, and Guadong, with a total of 5,200 mu of cultivated land and 1,008 people. There are 67 male full laborers, 80 semi-laborers, 175 female full laborers, and 157 semi-laborers, along with 39 head of livestock. Calculating based on male full and semi-laborers, each person has an average of 35.33 mu of cultivated land. If female full and semi-laborers are included, each person averages only 10.08 mu. Each head of livestock cultivates approximately 130 mu of land. If organized and led well, a general harvest could be achieved. However, due to the village leadership's lack of emphasis on production and allowing it to proceed uncontrolled, they merely used administrative orders to form 17 male mutual aid teams and 17 female mutual aid teams. In name, they were mutual aid teams, but in reality, each worked independently. As a result, 2,944 mu of wheat land throughout the village were generally unweeded, with weeds taller than the wheat. Each mu yielded an average of only three dou. The 1,016.25 mu of autumn crops had weeds growing into mats, with each mu yielding a maximum of only five dou. Furthermore, 550 mu of land were left uncultivated, covered in Artemisia half a person tall, which has not been plowed to this day. Many corn stalks still stand in the autumn fields, and there is no talk of turning the soil. The total grain harvested for the year averaged just over one shi and four dou per person. After deducting public grain and household expenses, the problem of food and drink becomes a concern.

　　张庄生产自流造成全村歉收
    【本报太岳二十七日电】浮山近发现张庄行政村干部，对生产放松领导，致全村歉收形成灾荒。张庄行政村，包括左村、宋家庄子、东南坡、西南坡、中南坡、挂东等七个自然村，共有耕地五千二百亩，一千零八口人，有男全劳力六十七个，半劳力八十个，妇女全劳力一百七十五个，半劳力一百五十七个，牲口三十九头。以男全半劳力计算，每人平均耕地三十五亩三分，若加上女全半劳力，每人仅平均十亩零八分，每头牲口耕种约一百三十亩地，如果能够组织领导好，是可以做到一般的收成的，但由于该村领导上对生产不重视，放任自流。只用行政命令编起十七个男互助组、十七个女互助组，名义上互助、实际上各干各，以致全村二千九百四十四亩麦地、普遍没锄，草比麦子高，每亩平均只打三斗；一千零十六亩四分秋禾，草长成了毡片，每亩最多只收五斗，并荒下地五百五十亩，长了半人高的蒿，至今尚未犁过；秋地内还长着不少的玉茭秆，根本谈不到垡地。全年打的粮食，每人平均一石四斗多，如除去公粮和家庭日用花费等，吃喝就成问题。
