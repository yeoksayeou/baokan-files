　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 27th. Over the past two weeks, local armed forces in eastern Manchuria have been clearing out scattered bandits in the new district following the autumn offensive. According to incomplete statistics, over 560 bandits have been killed, wounded, or captured, and the following have been seized: 4 six-zero mortars, 23 light machine guns, 1,783 various rifles, and one radio station. At present, the Chiang-Chen scattered bandits in the Jilin-Changchun area have been mostly eliminated. In the salient area south of the Songhua River, with the exception of the isolated strongholds of Changchun and Jilin, the area north from Dehui to Gongzhuling and south from Jilin to Panshi along the Changchun-Shenyang and Jilin-Shenyang lines, spanning over 200 li east-west and 400 li north-south, has seen the preliminary establishment of democratic order. Over two million people have broken free from the rule of Chiang's bandits and local tyrants. Our democratic government has also dispatched over a hundred cadres to assist the masses in this newly recovered area, known for its rich fish and grain production, to launch a movement to turn themselves over and redistribute the land.
