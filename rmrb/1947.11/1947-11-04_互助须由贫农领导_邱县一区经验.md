(Our newspaper, Jinan, 2nd dispatch) At the joint meeting of branch secretaries in the First District of Qiu County, it was proven by factual experience that production can only be improved under the leadership of poor peasants. There are many such facts in this district. For example, in Nanxiangcheng, 19 mutual aid groups were organized with poor peasants as their leaders. At the group leader meeting, everyone discussed the public pledge, which stated that landlords and rich peasants in the mutual aid group were not allowed to use farm tools. Regardless of large carts or small carts, they were used by the groups in turn. As a result, landlords and rich peasants bought two large carts and five seed drills during the wheat planting season, and seven hoes during the weeding season. The mutual aid group in Fu Xin Village, which was not led by poor peasants, was the exact opposite. The basic masses were universally in difficulty, and the problems could not be solved. To this day, poor peasants still have to hire middle peasants' cattle to plow their own wheat fields during the wheat planting season. For example, the poor peasant Zhang Huaixiu has made a living selling tobacco for many years. This year, he spent 4,000 yuan on labor to plant five mu of wheat. Such villages are not limited to Fu Xin Village. The director of the Farmers' Association in Nan Liu Village worked for the landlord all his life. He fell from a high house while watching the landlord's house and became disabled in his arms and legs. The landlord and the Hanlaohui pretended to be compassionate and said, "I can support you until you are old," but in the famine year, they pushed him out the door. During the land reform, he was given four mu of land and three rooms. He joined Yuan Zhaolin's mutual aid group. Because he could not do heavy work, he ground flour in the steamed bun workshop and shared the profits. He was a regular shareholder and planted all four mu of land with wheat. Grateful, he often said, "If I didn't participate in mutual aid, with my disabled arms and legs, not to mention harvesting grain, planting land, and sharing profits, wouldn't I starve to death?" He also said, "I will never forget mutual aid in my life." The poor peasants and widowed households in the village planted wheat early, just like him. The above facts prove that mutual aid groups must be based on poor peasants as the backbone, leading the middle peasants, so that the mutual aid groups can be successful, and the difficult problems of the poor peasants can be solved.

    互助须由贫农领导
    邱县一区经验
    【本报冀南二日电】邱县一区支部书记联席会议上，以事实经验证明，贫农领导生产才搞得好。象这样的事实，在该区是很多的。如南香城固以贫农为首的组织了十九个互助组，在组长会议上，大家讨论了公约，不叫不在互助组的地主富农使用农具，不论大车小车，都一组一组的轮流使用。为此，地主富农在种麦期买了二辆大车五张耧，在锄地时买了七张锄。傅辛庄不是贫农领导的互助组，就恰恰相反。基本群众普遍困难，问题得不到解决。至今天，贫农在种麦期中还要用钱雇中农牛来耕自己的麦地。如贫农张怀秀，多年来以卖旱烟为生，今年种麦中，雇人力及牛力，种了五亩麦子，就花了四千元的工价。象这样的村不仅是傅辛庄一村。南刘村农会主任给地主做了一辈子活，因给地主看宅子从高房子上跌下来，跌成残废胳膊残废腿，地主汉老会假装慈悲说：“可养到白发到老”，但在荒年，却把他推到门外。在土改时，他分了四亩地，三间房，他就参加了袁兆林的互助组。因他不能做重活，就在馒头坊磨面分红。他是正股，四亩地都耩上了麦子，感激的他常说：“我不参加互助，残胳膊残腿，别说收粮食种地又分红，饿还饿不死吗？”他还说：“我一辈子也忘不了互助。”该村的贫农和孤寡户都象他一样的就早早的种上了麦子。以上事实证明：互助组必须以贫农为骨干，带起中农，互助组才能搞好，贫农的困难问题才能解决。
