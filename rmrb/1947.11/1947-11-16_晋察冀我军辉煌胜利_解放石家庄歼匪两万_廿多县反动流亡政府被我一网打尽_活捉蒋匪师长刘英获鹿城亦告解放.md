　　Brilliant Victory of Our Army in Jin-Cha-Ji
  　Liberates Shijiazhuang, Annihilating 20,000 Bandits
    Counter-Revolutionary Exile Governments of More Than 20 Counties Swept Away in One Fell Swoop
    Chiang Bandit Division Commander Liu Ying Captured Alive; Huolu City Also Liberated
    [New China News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji Front, Urgent Telegram, 14th] The People's Liberation Army liberated Shijiazhuang, a key strategic location and transportation hub of the Chiang bandits in North China, on the 12th. After six days and nights of fierce fighting, all of the defending enemy forces, numbering more than 20,000 men, were annihilated. According to the Fifth Operational Communique issued by the Jin-Cha-Ji Front Command: After the great victory at Qingfengdian on the 22nd of last month, our army launched a fierce offensive against Shijiazhuang. Our various armies began to sweep away the Chiang bandit strongholds around Shijiazhuang on the 6th. After six days and nights of intense fighting, the battle was victoriously concluded at 12:00 noon on the 12th. The entire urban area was occupied by our forces. The entire defending enemy force, consisting of the 32nd Division of the Chiang bandit Third Army, as well as the 6th Regiment of the newly airlifted Provisional 32nd Division to Shijiazhuang, the 9th and 10th Regiments of the Hebei Security Forces, and the Chiang clique's county-level "Homecoming Legions" and police corps, totaling over 20,000 men, were annihilated. Liu Ying, the commander of the 32nd Division of the Chiang bandits, was captured alive by our forces. The Chiang bandit Shijiazhuang Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and the counter-revolutionary exile governments of more than 20 counties were all swept away in one fell swoop. The seized materials are piled up like mountains and are currently being inventoried. Nearly one million people inside and outside Shijiazhuang celebrated the liberation. Our democratic government has entered the city with the army to carry out rehabilitation work.
    [New China News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji Front, 14th] A frontline reporter reports: The Liberation Army unit that captured the Yunpan Mountain, the commanding height northeast of Shijiazhuang, reports that the area is over three zhang (approximately 10 meters) above the ground, and the enemy had built solid steel-reinforced concrete fortifications, making it an important natural barrier for Shijiazhuang. A local proverb says, "Losing Yunpan Mountain means losing half of Shijiazhuang." After a detailed investigation of the terrain around the mountain, and thorough study by commanders and fighters at all levels, a Liberation Army unit launched a fierce attack on the area on the morning of the 8th, supported by howitzers. The sound of gunfire and artillery shook the heavens and the earth. The assault team of the 8th Company, after overcoming numerous obstacles, crossed two defensive ditches and broke through the electric fence, immediately rushing to the top of the mountain. Seeing the fierce attack of our forces, the defending enemy dared not engage in close combat and fled in a panic along the tunnels to the core fortifications. By the time our army's red flag was unfurled on the summit, the artillery smoke had not yet dissipated. The entire battle lasted only ten minutes. The capture of this area by our forces created extremely favorable conditions for breaking through the first line of defense of the Chiang bandits on the east and north sides of Shijiazhuang. For this reason, the unit's leaders issued a commendation order, praising the battle as an example of careful planning combined with skill and bravery.
    [New China News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji Front, Urgent Telegram, 13th Morning, 12:00] A frontline reporter reports: After six days and nights of fierce fighting from the 6th to the 12th, the People's Liberation Army completely liberated Shijiazhuang, the strategic location known as the transportation hub of North China and the center of the North China Liberated Areas. On October 22nd, after the Liberation Army annihilated over 13,000 enemy troops from the Third Army and other units at Qingfengdian, our army launched an offensive against the isolated island of Shijiazhuang. The main force approached the outskirts of Shijiazhuang on the 5th. Starting on the 6th, a sweeping operation was launched within the Chiang bandit defense line, which extended approximately 100 li (50 kilometers) around Shijiazhuang. By the evening of the 7th, our army had successively captured more than a dozen important enemy towns such as Huolu City, about 40 li (20 kilometers) west of Shijiazhuang, Gaoqian Railway Station, about 30 li (15 kilometers) south, and Daguo Village and its airfield, about 20 li (10 kilometers) northwest. On the 8th, our army launched a general offensive on the enemy's first line of defense on all fronts. The roar of artillery and gunfire shook the heavens, and smoke filled the sky. After twenty minutes, the southwest line was the first to break through the enemy's defense line, and the main force swarmed in. Another unit of our army in the northeast suburbs of the city completely occupied the commanding height of Yunpan Mountain in ten minutes, and then coordinated with our forces in the northwest and southeast to sweep away the enemy trenches, rapidly advancing towards the urban area. At this point, the 60-li (30-kilometer) first line of defense painstakingly built by the enemy collapsed. At 4:30 p.m. on the 10th, our army launched a general offensive on the urban area. In less than twenty minutes, the enemy's inner city ditch and second line of defense were also broken through by our army. After occupying Donglicun and Nanbingying, the Public Sports Field, and other places west of the Shiqiao Bridge, the unit advanced in a roundabout way. Another unit of our army, after breaking through the southeast defense line of the Shiqiao Bridge, bypassed enemy resistance along Zhongzheng Road and Funing Road and rapidly advanced towards the city center. By 12:00 on the 11th, the enemy at various points in the urban area were collapsing, discarding their helmets and armor and surrendering in droves. By this time, most of the urban area was occupied by our forces. The electric company, radio station, Daxing Yarn Factory, and railway station all fell into our hands. Only a portion of the bandit army continued to stubbornly resist in the barracks north of the Shiqiao Bridge, and launched several counterattacks against our forces with tanks and armored vehicles, but they were all thwarted by the fierce bombardment of our rocket launchers and anti-tank guns. On the morning of the 12th, our armies launched a final attack on the bandits, and by noon, the enemy's 32nd Division headquarters and other units guarding the area were annihilated. The enemy guarding Fancun in the eastern suburbs of the city immediately surrendered collectively. At this point, the city of Shijiazhuang, which had been ruled by the Japanese invaders for eight years and trampled by the Chiang bandits for two years and three months, was completely liberated. Nearly one million people inside and outside the city saw the light of day again, and the liberated areas of North China were completely connected in a vast area.
