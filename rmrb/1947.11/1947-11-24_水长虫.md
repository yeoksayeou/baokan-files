　　"Water Dragon" refers to a boat steered by the heroic boatman Zhang Yuchun.

　　On November 1st, at the model boatman conference in the ×× Yellow River ferry, involving 650 boatmen from four counties, including Juancheng, Nanhua, Kunwu, and Puyang, Zhang Yuchun was selected as the first among the 25 heroes.

　　Zhang Yuchun is from Zhang Village, Second District, Juancheng, of poor peasant origin, and is currently twenty-two years old. When Liu and Deng's army crossed the river, Zhang Yuchun was in Kunwu, where he first displayed heroic spirit. Under the Kuomintang bandits' flares, bombs, and frantic strafing, Zhang Yuchun's boat was the first to cross the river, acting as a vanguard for the army's crossing, boosting the courage of the boatmen on other boats, and completing the great task of ferrying the army across the river for the first time.

　　The Yellow River's torrents are turbulent and the waves are surging. To cross the river, boats cannot directly head to the opposite bank. They need to be towed upstream or punted and paddled for two to three or four *li* before they can diagonally angle downstream to the opposite bank. When our ×× column crossed the river, a large number of boats gathered at the ×× ferry. Boats from Dong'a also arrived. As soon as the order to set sail was given, the boatloads of soldiers raced ahead, unwilling to yield to each other, vying to be the first to reach the south bank. Zhang Yuchun's boat, because it set sail later, was left behind by a boat from Dong'a by a distance of two *li*. Zhang Yuchun encouraged the boatmen on his boat, saying, "Work hard! Don't think they set sail first, we will definitely overtake them!" He was the first to jump off the boat and, with eight boatmen, unfurled the tow rope. Their waists bent forward, almost touching the ground, their legs firmly planted, they desperately pulled the sail upstream. When they reached a certain point, broke through the torrents, and angled the boat toward the opposite bank, they needed to use the "stern anchor" method, or paddle across. The "stern anchor" is both labor-saving and fast. Zhang Yuchun's boat's anchor didn't grip, so he led everyone to punt and paddle. When punting, shoulders pressed against the oar handle, legs pushing against the ground, his body leaned forward at an angle of more than seventy degrees to the deck, almost prostrate on the deck. Thus, he continuously punted on the deck, time after time. When using the oars, he led everyone to grip the oars tightly and desperately rowed. As a result, their boat flew back and forth. After three crossings, they finally overtook the boat from Dong'a that had set sail earlier than them. In one night, other boats could only cross three or four times to five or six times, while Zhang Yuchun's boat crossed as many as nine times. The boatmen on the Dong'a boat all praised in admiration, "Ah! This is truly a water dragon!" From then on, Zhang Yuchun's boat was called "Water Dragon."

　　In early August, his boat and another boat were crossing from the east bank to the west bank. At the time, it was already dawn, and as a result, they were spotted by an airplane, which immediately strafed them. People and several cows about to cross the river ran wildly, his boat was shot through with three holes, and the other boat also had four holes. Water poured into the boat from the holes. Seeing that the boat was about to sink, Zhang Yuchun quickly plugged the holes while everyone was panicking, and the two boats avoided sinking.

　　In mid-September, many wounded soldiers were transported from Henan. He not only quickly ferried the wounded soldiers, but also took special care of them. When he carried the wounded soldiers off the boat, he was afraid of touching the wounded areas, so he would always ask about the location of the wounds beforehand, and then carefully carry the wounded soldiers off the boat. He also placed the boat's planks on the bank near the flood prevention house, settled the wounded soldiers, and then led the person in charge of transporting the wounded soldiers to the military station.

　　Other boatmen sometimes inevitably became impatient and scolded those crossing the river, but Zhang Yuchun never did that. He would patiently settle those crossing the river after they boarded the boat. After the boat docked on the opposite bank, he would set up the plank, lead the people down, and then ask those getting off the boat, "Have you checked to see if you've forgotten anything on the boat?"

　　Although he had sores on his feet, he shuttled back and forth across the Yellow River day and night, regardless of fatigue.

　　水长虫
    君谦
    “水长虫”，这是指水手英雄张玉春撑的一只船说的。
    在十一月一日，××黄河渡口，鄄城、南华、昆吾、濮县等四县六百五十名水手表模大会上，张玉春被选为二十五名英雄的第一名。
    张玉春是鄄城二区张村人，贫农出身，现年二十二岁。当刘邓大军过河时，张玉春在昆吾，即首先表现了英勇的气概，在蒋匪照明弹、炸弹与疯狂扫射下，张玉春撑的一只船，首先渡河，做了摆渡过河大军的先锋，鼓起了其他船上水手的勇气，完成了第一次撑渡过河大军的伟大任务。
    黄河的洪流湍激，浪涛汹涌，过河的船，不能直接往对岸撑渡，需要往上游拉纤，或用篙撑、用桨划二里至三、四里处，才能斜插着往下游摆至对岸。当我×纵队渡河时，××渡口集拢了大批船只，东阿的船也到了，开船令一发出，载满大军的船群，就谁也不肯让谁，争先恐后的往南岸抢渡起来。张玉春的船，因为开船较晚，被东阿的一只船撇在后面有二里之远，张玉春鼓动着他船上的水手说：“干呀！别看他们先开船，咱非越过他们不可！”他首先跳下船，和八名水手扯开纤绳，腰干往前弓得几乎着了地，两腿紧蹬着地，就拼命往上游拉起篷来。在拉到一定程度，冲过洪流，往对岸斜放船时，需要用“梢锚”法，或用桨划过去，“梢锚”比划既省力又快。张玉春船上的锚不抓地不管用，他就带着大家撑篙和划起桨来。撑桨时，肩抵住桨拐，两腿蹬着地，身体往前俯得与船板成了七十多度的角度，身子几乎仆在船板上，就这样，在船板上一次次的不断撑着。在用桨时，他又带着大家抓紧了桨，紧张的拼命划，他们的船，就因此来往的飞渡起来。在渡过三次后，他们终于越过了东阿那只比他们先开的船，一夜的工夫，别人的船只能渡三、四次至五、六次，而张玉春的船却渡了九次之多。东阿那只船上的水手，都非常惊服的称赞道：“呵！这真是一个水长虫！”从此张玉春的船，就喊起“水长虫”来了。
    八月初，他的船和另一只船，从东岸要往西岸渡时，当时天已明了，结果被飞机发现，立即被扫射起来。人们和要渡河的几头牛，被扫射得狂奔，他的那只船被射穿三个洞，另外一只，也出现了四个窟窿，水从窟窿猛涌进船。眼看船要沉没，张玉春在大家惊慌不定的时候，迅速将窟窿塞住，两只船就避免了沉没。
    九月中旬，从河南运过许多伤员，他不但迅速运渡伤员，还特别照顾伤员，他背伤员下船时，怕碰着彩号的创伤，都是预先问明伤口的地方后，才很稳重的将伤员背下船来，又将船上的床，铺在堤上的防泛屋边，将伤员安置好了，然后又领着运伤员的负责人，找到了兵站。
    其他水手，有时不免发躁，呵斥渡河的人，张玉春却从来没有那样过。他都是将渡河的人上了船后，很耐心的安置好，船靠对岸后，他将板搭好，把人领下去，然后再问下船的人：“您看看忘在船上东西了吗？”
    他虽然脚上长着疮，也整天整夜不顾疲累的穿渡在黄河上。
