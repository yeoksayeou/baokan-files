Xinhua News Agency, Su, Lu, Yu, and Anhui Front, 23rd. A front-line reporter comments: The brilliant victory of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in the war to destroy the Longhai Railway will force Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in the northern Jiangsu, Henan, Anhui, and Shandong battlefields to shift from offensive defense to pure defense. The PLA completely controlled the Xuzhou-Shangqiu and Minquan-Lanfeng sections, a total of over 300 li of railway line, within more than 40 hours, and thoroughly destroyed it. The Xuzhou-Bengbu section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway also suffered partial damage, and successively recovered nine county towns and vast villages and towns, annihilating more than 10,000 Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Thus, it severed the only east-west railway trunk line connecting the two major railways of Ping-Han and Tianjin-Pukou in North China, making it completely impossible for Chiang Kai-shek's bandits to use this line for east-west maneuverability and deployment. The repair of the Longhai Railway will not be this year's business, nor will it belong to Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, but will belong to the PLA and the people. Chiang Kai-shek's bandits will now have to compete with the PLA on foot, so the opportunities for the PLA to annihilate large numbers of Chiang Kai-shek's troops will obviously increase even more. The victory in the Longhai Railway destruction war especially greatly exposed the emptiness of Chiang Kai-shek's strategic central cities. When the PLA's shells exploded in the suburbs of Xuzhou, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Xuzhou had to hastily declare a state of emergency and prepare for street fighting. At the same time, they frantically mobilized a total of 21 brigades, including the 5th Division, 11th Division, 28th Division, 25th Division, 75th Division, 84th Division, 77th Division, 59th Division, and one brigade of the 88th Division, as well as the New 15th Brigade, remnants of the 72nd Division, to reinforce Xuzhou. In addition, two brigades of the 68th Division and remnants of the 55th Division were used to reinforce Minquan. According to prisoners from Chiang Kai-shek's 25th Division, the division was originally planned to be transferred to the Hubei-Henan-Anhui battlefield, but was transferred north via Pukou due to the emergency in Xuzhou. Obviously, Chiang Kai-shek's "empty-heart tactics" played in strategic central cities have now had to be changed to shrinking the defense of a few mobile troops under the pressure of the PLA. Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek's offensive defense will be forced to completely turn into pure defense. But regardless of whether Chiang Kai-shek is "empty-hearted" or "solid-hearted," the second and third Shijiazhuang will continue to appear. As for Chiang Kai-shek's future harassing offenses against the Su, Lu, Yu, and Anhui liberated areas, they are still possible, but they are basically passive. The reporter especially emphasized the new atmosphere shown by the PLA in the war after land reform studies. Along the hundreds of miles of railway line, PLA commanders and fighters can be seen everywhere helping the people in the new areas to stand up, publicizing land reform, and distributing grain and wealth immediately after the battle, and the concept of the masses has become even stronger. For example, a certain unit borrowed door panels to carry wounded soldiers in the Dangshan battle, and returned the door panels five li out of the city. As for the doubling of the attacking spirit, it is even more obvious. When conquering Dangshan, the gateway to Xuzhou, which was heavily fortified by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, they broke into the city in just 15 minutes and completely resolved the battle in three hours. In the battle to conquer Yucheng, they completely annihilated more than 900 enemy troops in one hour at the cost of less than ten casualties. Even the 5th Division, one of the five main forces of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, had to avoid our main force and detour under the stubborn resistance of our army.

Xinhua News Agency, Su, Lu, Yu, and Anhui Front, 23rd. After the middle section of the Longhai Railway was completely destroyed, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits were extremely embarrassed because the traffic between the southeast and northwest was cut off. According to a Central News Agency report on the 20th, Chiang Kai-shek's authorities had to admit: "In the future, only three routes can be used for transportation between the southeast and northwest regions: (1) from Chongqing via Guangyuan and then to the northwest provinces. (2) From Hankou via Laohekou, Ankang (in southern Shaanxi) and then to the northwest provinces. (3) From Baotou via Wuyuan and then to the northwest provinces, of which the second route is the most convenient." The above three routes are all thousands of miles away, with dangerous mountains and obstacles. Even the second route, which Chiang Kai-shek's bandits consider the most convenient, is a journey of thousands of miles with rugged roads and no modern transportation equipment. In particular, the Liu-Deng army has controlled the Hubei-Henan-Anhui area, and the Chen-Xie army and the Shaanxi Southern People's Armed Forces have penetrated into Henan and Shaanxi, so this second route is only a "pipe dream."

### 陇海路破击战辉煌胜利　迫蒋匪趋入单纯防御  我军大量歼敌机会更加增多

　　陇海路破击战辉煌胜利
  　迫蒋匪趋入单纯防御
    我军大量歼敌机会更加增多
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线廿三日电】前线记者评论：解放军对陇海路线破击战的辉煌胜利，将使蒋匪在苏北、鲁豫皖战场由攻势防御被迫转入单纯防御。解放军在四十余小时内完全控制了徐（州）商（邱）段和民（权）兰（封）段，共三百余里的铁道线，予以彻底破坏。津浦线的徐（州）蚌（埠）段也遭受到部分的破坏，并相继收复九座县城及广大村镇，歼灭蒋匪万余人。由是斩断了蒋匪在华北联系平汉、津浦两大铁路的唯一东西铁道干线，使蒋匪完全失去利用该线东西机动调动的便利。陇海铁路的修复将不是今年的事，也不是蒋匪的，而将属于解放军和人民的事了。蒋匪今后将只好和解放军作徒步的竞赛，因此解放军大量歼灭蒋匪军的机会显然将更为增多。陇海路破击战的胜利，尤其大大的暴露了蒋匪战略中心城市的空虚。当解放军的炮弹在徐州市郊爆裂时，徐州蒋匪不得不仓惶宣布紧急戒严，作巷战准备，同时慌调五师、十一师、二八师、二五师、七五师、八四师、七七师、五九师及八八师的一个旅和七二师残部的新十五旅等共二十一个旅的兵力增援徐州，另以六八师两个旅和五五师残部增援民权。据蒋匪二五师之俘虏供称：该师原拟调往鄂豫皖战场，路经浦口时，因徐州吃紧而北调，显然蒋匪在战略中心城市玩弄的“空心战术”在解放军的压力下，现已不得不改变为将少数机动兵收缩守备。因而蒋匪的攻势防御，将被迫完全转为单纯防御。但是不管蒋匪“空心”也好，“实心”也好，第二、第三个石家庄将会继续出现。至于今后蒋匪对苏鲁豫皖解放区的骚扰性出犯，则仍属可能，惟基本上是被动性的。记者特别强调解放军经过土改学习后，在战争中所表现的新气象。沿铁路线数百里，随处可见解放军指战员在战斗刚结束后，即帮助新区人民翻身，宣传土改，分粮分财，群众观念也更加强。如某部于砀山战斗中借用门板抬送伤兵，出城五里仍将门板送还。至于攻击精神的倍增，更为明显，在攻克徐州门户蒋匪坚固设防的砀山时，仅十五分钟即突入城中，三小时全部解决战斗。而攻克虞城之役，则以伤亡不及十名的代价，在一小时内全歼守敌九百余。即号称蒋匪五大主力之一的整五师，在我军顽强阻击下，亦不得不避开我主力绕道而行。
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线二十三日电】陇海路中段被彻底破坏后，蒋匪因东南与西北的交通被斩断，异常狼狈。据中央社二十日电透露，蒋匪当局不得不承认：“今后东南区与西北交通只有三条路线可以利用：（一）从重庆经由广元再转西北各省。（二）从汉口经由老河口、安康（在陕南）再转西北各省。（三）从包头经由五原再转西北各省，其中以第二路最为便捷”。上述三条路线都是千里迢迢，关山险阻，即蒋匪认为最便的第二条路，也是行程千里，道路崎岖，并无现代交通设备。特别是刘邓大军已控制了鄂豫皖地区，陈谢大军及陕南人民武装则深入豫陕，这第二条路线也仅属“空想”而已。
