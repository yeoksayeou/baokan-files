[This article was transmitted by the] Jinnan [correspondent of] this newspaper on the 4th. Taozhai in the Second District of Qiuxian County, overcame various difficulties to strive to plant wheat. Due to heavy rains this autumn, most of the land was flooded, with only the cotton fields south of the village spared. The masses showed very low enthusiasm for planting wheat. For example, Zhao Wuzhuo's ten mu of wheat land still has more than a foot of water. When village cadres mentioned planting wheat to the masses, they sadly said, "The fields are full of water, and wheat cannot be planted." Everyone was very worried about planting wheat and turned to engaging in sideline occupations. For example, Zhao Wenya's group of thirteen people are all ginning cotton. Labor hero Wang Dianchen convened a mass meeting of the entire village to ask everyone to raise difficulties, think of solutions, and start discussions. During the discussion, the masses raised many difficulties such as the lack of draft animals, fertilizer, and flooded land, especially the poor peasants faced more difficulties. When discussing solutions, Yang Fengxi said, "We shouldn't wait when the land is flooded. We should dig ditches where we need to dig ditches, and release water where we need to release water. If there is no water, we should quickly use a seeder or hoe to promote ventilation and quick drying." Wang Fengyuan said, "Whoever has more high land that they can't plant can exchange it with others for planting, or change the crop, rotate the crop, or pull out the cotton stalks for planting." Others said, "If there are no cattle, we can share them, organize temporary mutual aid teams, and pull plows and seeders." In the end, it was decided: (1) In addition to the existing mutual aid teams, those who have not participated in mutual aid can organize mutual aid teams; regardless of the form, allocating labor and cooperative plowing can supplement the shortage of manpower and animal power to carry out a blitz to plant wheat. (2) In addition to digging ditches to control water in flooded areas by groups, land without water should be quickly seeded or hoeed. (3) We should change crops, rotate crops, and pull out cotton stalks to plant wheat; under the principle of voluntariness, land can be exchanged for planting. This year, wheat is planted on your land, and next year, cotton will be planted on my land. Wang Dianchen finally pointed out clearly: "The soil will be fertile in three years, and anything can be applied to the land. Don't be stingy with the land." After this discussion, the difficulties in planting wheat were resolved, and the masses had confidence and determination in planting wheat. After the meeting, each mutual aid team formulated a wheat planting plan. Except for Wang Dianchen and three other groups who continued to engage in sideline occupations due to surplus labor, other groups stopped sideline occupations and proceeded to plant wheat. Yang Fengxi's group of thirteen people stopped sideline occupations and the entire group carried out a blitz to plant wheat. Lei Yuzeng pulled out cotton stalks from four mu and planted all of them with wheat. Zhao Zhenzhong didn't have high land, so he adjusted the land and exchanged land to plant five mu of wheat. Gao Fengkui organized a temporary mutual aid team to pull seeders for sowing. Every household in the village rushed to plant wheat.

    邱县桃寨
    组织临时拨工搭犋
    挖河顺水种地种麦
    【本报冀南四日电】邱县二区桃寨，克服种种困难，争取种上麦子。因今秋雨大，大部土地被水淹没，仅村南棉花地未被水淹，群众对种麦情绪非常低落。如赵五琢十亩留麦地，现仍存水尺余。村干给群众一提种麦，群众都很难过的说：“地里净水，麦子是种不上了。”对种麦都表示很发愁，纷纷转向搞副业。如赵文雅组十三人都轧花。劳动英雄王殿臣召开全村群众会，要大家提困难，想办法，展开讨论。讨论时群众提出没耕牛、没肥料、水淹地等很多困难，尤其贫农困难更多。在讨论解决办法时，杨风西说：“地淹了不应等待，该掘沟就挖沟，该放水就放水，没水了就赶快用耧豁，脚蹴，透风干的快。”王风元说：“谁高地多，种不了，可与别人进行换种，或改茬、换茬、拔花柴种。”还有的说：“没牛可碰班，组织临时互助组，拉犁拉耧。”最后决定：（一）除现有互助组外，未参加互助的可组织互助组；不论形式，拨工、搭犋都可来补充人畜力不足，进行突击种麦。（二）水淹地除以组为单位挖沟治水外，没水的地应抓紧耧豁，脚蹴。（三）应改茬、换茬、拔花柴种麦子；在自愿原则下，可进行土地换种。今年在你地种上麦子，明年在我地种花。王殿臣最后明确指出：“三年土也壮，啥也可往地里上，对地不要小气。”经过这一讨论，解决了种麦困难，群众对种麦都有信心与决心。会后各互助组都订了种麦计划，除王殿臣等三个组因劳力剩余仍继续搞副业外，其他组都停止副业，进行种麦。杨凤西组，十三人停止副业，全组突击种麦。雷玉曾拔花柴四亩，都种上麦子。赵振中没高地，土地调剂，换地种麦五亩。高风魁组织临时互助组，拉耧下种，全村户户抢种麦。
