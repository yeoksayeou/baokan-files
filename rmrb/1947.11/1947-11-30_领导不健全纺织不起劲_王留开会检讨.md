　　Poor Leadership Hinders Textile Production
　　Wang Liu Holds Meeting for Self-Criticism
　　[This newspaper's Gaoyi dispatch] In Wang Liu Village, there are 132 young and middle-aged women, most of whom can spin, but only 17 can weave. Eight spinning and weaving groups were organized, with 85 participants. The textile production has been very sluggish recently. After research by group leaders and above, the main reason is that the women have some confused ideas, looking down on the profits of spinning and weaving. In addition, the organizational leadership is unsound, and the cadres have not played a leading role, creating obstacles in textile production. After the self-criticism, in addition to solving ideological problems, the following measures were determined: 1. Mobilize active elements and cadres to start spinning in their own homes first. 2. Weaving machines should not be idle; if one group doesn't need it, it can be lent to another group (the village has ten usable machines). 3. Mutual aid group leaders should check performance, solve problems, and report to the production guidance group once every five days. 4. Establish methods for exchanging labor in spinning and weaving. The masses generally want to weave and wear their own cloth, putting forward the slogan: "Whoever doesn't buy cloth is a model; those who can't weave can exchange labor; weave for yourselves and wear your own cloth, strive to sell the excess to make money." After the meeting, driven by active elements and cadres, four machines have now started weaving, and most spinning women start spinning in the evening, with half of the women spinning until after twelve o'clock before going to sleep. (Wen Yan, Shu Zao, Qiao Lin)
　　[This newspaper's Licheng dispatch] In Cheyuan Village, Fifth District, after calculating the annual harvest and taking stock of their families, they recognized the disaster situation. Old and young women are of one mind to make up for the deficit through winter spinning and weaving. From November 16th to 20th, they made great achievements in five days. For example, Guo Chunmei wove ten zhang of cloth, starting early and working late, and the quality was good. Jia Peng wove three zhang of cloth and spun three jin of cotton. Statistics show that thirteen spinning and weaving groups, with 97 spinning and weaving women, spun 66 jin and 12 liang of cotton and wove 40 zhang of cloth in five days, all exceeding the plan.

　　领导不健全纺织不起劲
  　王留开会检讨
    【本报高邑讯】王留村青壮年妇女共一三二名，大部都会纺，会织的只十七人，组织了八个纺织组，参加人有八十五，这段纺织很不起劲，经组长以上会议研究主要是因妇女有些糊涂思想，看不起纺织利润，再加上组织领导不健全，干部没有起带头作用，造成纺织中的障碍。检查后除解决思想问题外，又确定了以下办法：一、通过积极分子和干部动员自己家先纺起来。二、织布机不停，这组不用可借给那组，（全村十个能用机）。三、互助组长检查成绩，解决问题，五日向生产指导组报告一次。四、定出纺织变工办法。群众普遍思想要求自织自穿，提出口号：“谁家不买布，谁家是模范，不会织拿工变，自织自穿争取出卖来赚钱。”经过会议，通过积极分子和干部推动，现在已有四个机开始织布，大部纺妇在晚上开始纺，有二分之一的妇女纺到十二点后才睡。（文彦、书藻、乔林）
    【本报黎城讯】五区车元村，经过算年成、清家当，认识了灾荒，老少妇女一条心，以冬季纺织，弥补亏空。自十一月十六日至二十日，五天做出很大的成绩。如郭春梅起早搭黑，织布十丈，质量又好。贾捧织布三丈，纺花三斤。统计十三个纺织小组，纺织妇女九十七人，五天纺花六十六斤十二两，织布四十丈，都超过了计划。（岱云、子珍）
