　　[Tangyin News from this newspaper] On the 5th of this month, more than 80 enemies from Bianhe and Anshang went to rob grain in two directions, one straight to Fanzhuang and the other straight to Lijiawan. The enemy on the Lijiawan road came into contact with our militia. Our militia fought and retreated. Seeing our retreat, the enemy chased after us. The Work Team took the opportunity to insert themselves behind the enemy, opening fire. They first shot and killed two flag bearers. Seeing that the situation was not good, the enemy abandoned the corpses and fled. We immediately launched a fierce pursuit, killing three enemies, wounding seven, and seizing one rifle, four rows of bullets, and several red-tasseled spears. We suffered no casualties. At that time, we buried landmines near the enemy's corpses, waiting for the enemy to come and snatch the corpses at night. Sure enough, as we predicted, the enemy stepped on the landmines while stealing corpses that night, and the corpse thieves also became dead corpses. The next day (6th), the enemy from Kongcun in the fifth district joined forces with the local armed forces and went to Nanyuan and Sanlilou south of our city to rob grain. They were repelled by the Fourth Detachment of our Armed Forces Support. That night, we organized an attack on the village's local armed forces, rushing into the village and engaging in a fierce battle with the enemy, killing and wounding more than ten enemies before we withdrew from the battle. (Shen Zhi)

　　[Xiuwu News from this newspaper] After the Third District's Rotation Team accepted the task of protecting the autumn harvest, protecting farmland, rushing to plant, and eliminating wasteland, they attacked the roads every day, cutting off enemy transportation and communication, and engaging the enemy in activities day and night. Everyone was very enthusiastic and strived to make contributions to the people. According to statistics from the 20th to the 30th, they achieved unprecedented results, with two major battles, capturing two bandit soldiers, three local diehards, the secretary of the Henan Police Station, Mu Chaojin, and two others, one informant, four big traitors, six family members of traitors, and two defectors from the 38th Bandit Division, killing two enemies and wounding three, a total of twenty-five people. We suffered no casualties, and seized ten livestock and three cars. Now, the villages behind enemy lines are contacting us one after another to hand over public grain. (Lin Shuxin)

　　[Xiuwu News from this newspaper] In order to smash the enemy's plan to rob grain and launch a grain protection struggle, our Public Security Bureau's plainclothes team, led by Comrade Zhao Fuquan, went deep behind enemy lines, conducting political offensives and capturing traitors, and cracking down on enemy and puppet organizations. In ten days, they captured a total of twenty-nine traitors and spies, and killed or wounded five enemies. They set out from the Gaotun Village south of the Daokou-Qinghua Road on the night of the 25th of last month. Without firing a shot, they captured the village's big Baochang Liu Shijun, small Baochang Song Tongshun, black gun murderer Yang Xiaosi and seven others. On the night of the 27th, they cooperated with the militia of the Third Detachment to attack Baizhuang Village, less than half a mile from the Daiwang stronghold, and captured the village's traitors Lu Haozhang, Lu Shengshun, and five others. On the night of the 29th, they went to Zhanggong and captured the village's big and small traitors Wang Youren and four others. On the night of the 31st, they went deep into Suli Village south of the railway and captured Li Shengfu and four others. On the night of the 3rd of this month, they cooperated with the Third Detachment and went to Miaohe to capture the village's ruler Wang Guangyao and seven others, giving the enemy a great blow. They not only achieved such results in capturing traitors, but also actively patrolled the Daokou-Qinghua Road during the day, regardless of fatigue, intercepting sporadic enemy and puppet personnel. In the afternoon of the 3rd, five of them, led by Comrade Zhao Baoshan, walked onto the railway. As soon as they got on the road, a fellow was riding a foreign car from east to west. Comrades Wang Hongli and Li Geda stood tensely and calmly on the road without moving. When the enemy approached, the two comrades rushed forward bravely and captured him. After investigation, it was found that he was Wang Huangyi, a deputy officer of the Third Division. On the night of the 30th of last month, more than 300 enemy and puppet troops surrounded our villages at the foot of the mountain, Shangma, etc., looting grain and livestock. After the militia in the villages opened fire, the plainclothes team comrades inserted themselves behind the enemy and intercepted them, killing one member of the puppet self-defense corps and capturing two secret agents. On the night of the 25th of last month, Comrades Zhao Baoshan, Zhao Bingyun and five other comrades planted two landmines on the coal pile northeast of Lihe Station, estimating that the enemy would definitely go up to stand guard the next day. As expected, the next day, several fellows from the 38th Division went up to stand guard. The landmines went off, killing one enemy and wounding two. (Shi Chang)
