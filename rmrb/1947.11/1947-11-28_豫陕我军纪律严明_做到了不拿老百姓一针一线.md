　　Xinhua News Agency, Yu-E-Shaan Front, 26th: Correspondent Su Ce reports: Wherever the Yu-E-Shaan People's Liberation Army goes, discipline is strict, and it truly achieves not taking a needle or thread from the people. Soldiers universally launched "thinking of ways" campaigns. When liberating Lushi, the leadership stipulated that only 500 personnel from the attacking troops and various cadres were allowed to enter the city. When leaving the city, everyone had to undergo detailed inspection. Even though many soldiers' shoes were worn out at that time, they did not casually put on the shoes seized from the enemy. In the discussion of the "thinking of ways" campaign in the 5th Company of a certain regiment, it was proposed that borrowing things should be done by designated personnel for borrowing and designated personnel for returning. If there was not enough time to return the items, they should agree in advance with the villagers on where to place the items, so that the villagers could retrieve them themselves after they left. Under no circumstances should they fail to put the door panels back for the villagers. During the discussion at the Quartermaster Conference, everyone unanimously agreed that when exchanging noodles with the villagers, the villagers must benefit. Someone asked: What if the troops eat the villagers' noodles when the villagers are not at home? Everyone said that our wheat should be placed in the original place, and a note of apology should be left. If the troops eat the villagers' vegetables when the villagers are not at home, the money should be left with the neighbors, and a note should be left on the door panel explaining the situation. However, everyone's intention was that it was best not to eat them. There were no troughs in southern Shaanxi, and livestock often damaged the villagers' baskets when eating grass. When discussing this issue, it was decided not to borrow the villagers' baskets to feed the livestock, but to sew light and easy-to-carry troughs out of rags. In the "thinking of ways" campaign of the entire army, the model Ye Chenglong squad was quickly discovered. This squad consisted of veteran soldiers from the old liberated areas, newly liberated soldiers, and soldiers who had been liberated from the Chiang army's regular army and local forces. They came from different backgrounds, but through continuous education, they were all able to abide by mass discipline. Especially after the "thinking of ways" campaign, the soldiers' greatest creation was to actively overcome their own difficulties and not borrow anything from the villagers at all. For example, when Wang Fan Town was captured, each person in the squad bought a needle and thread to mend their own clothes, so they did not trouble the villagers. They also prepared their own shoe repair tools, and they would repair their shoes themselves when they rested. Because of this, the discipline of the Yu-E-Shaan People's Liberation Army won even greater victories in southern Shaanxi. When Shangluo Town was liberated, the villagers went to the market as usual. After the liberation of Longjuzhai, the shops automatically resumed business as usual in the afternoon.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji Front, 26th: Belated news: In the battle to liberate Shijiazhuang, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army strictly observed the discipline of entering the city, and did not commit the slightest offense against the citizens. All enemy materials seized were turned over to the public. During the battle, a certain unit completely sealed up clothing and daily necessities piled up in the bandit and puppet warehouses at the station, and handed over the two truckloads of clothing seized to the regimental branch. More than a thousand bolts of foreign cloth and nearly 100 million Chiang currency seized by a certain unit were also handed over to the public in full. New soldier Han Ying saw that there was no one in a shop during a search, but he did not touch any of the items in the shop. When he came out, he closed the door of the shop. Liberated soldier Yuan Mingxing had not eaten for a day and took a piece of biscuit from the people, but was immediately stopped by soldier Zheng Mingliang. A certain unit entered a large carriage and horse shop, and the masses prepared tea and meals to entertain them, but the soldiers politely declined. The soldiers also took great care of public property. When a certain unit was searching for remnants of bandits at the station, they passed by the Chiang Kai-shek Transportation Automobile Factory and specially left soldiers to guard the hundreds of cars in the factory.

　　豫陕我军纪律严明
  　做到了不拿老百姓一针一线
    【新华社豫鄂陕前线二十六日电】随军记者苏策报导：豫鄂陕人民解放军军行所至，纪律严明，真正做到了不拿老百姓一针一线。战士们普遍的展开了想办法运动。解放卢氏时，领导上规定攻城部队及各种干部只准五百人进城，出城时无论何人都要经过详细检查，虽然那时许多战士的鞋都穿破了，缴到敌人的鞋也没有随便自己穿上。某团五连在想办法运动的讨论中，提出借东西要专人借、专人还，如考虑时间来不及还，应事先与老乡约好放置东西的地方，走后由老乡自取。不论在任何情况下，都要给老乡上门板。在事务长会议的讨论中，大家一致同意和老乡换面，必须让老乡占便宜才行。有人提出：如果老乡不在家部队如吃了老乡的面怎么办？大家说应把我们的麦子放在原处，并留信道歉。如果老乡不在家部队吃了他们的菜时应把钱留给邻家，并在门板上留字说明。但大家的意思是最好不要吃。陕南没有马槽，牲口吃草常把老乡的筐子咬坏，在讨论这问题时，决定不借老乡的筐子喂牲口，另用破布缝成轻便易带的马槽。就在全军想办法运动中，很快就发现了模范的叶成龙班。这一班里有老解放区战士，有新解放战士，其中又有从蒋军正规军及地方团队中解放过来的。来历各异，但是在不断教育中均能遵守群众纪律。特别在想办法运动后，战士们最大的创造就是主动的克服自己的困难，根本不借老乡东西。比如打下王范镇时，全班每人买一针线，自补衣服，就不向老乡找麻烦，他们并自备补鞋工具，一到休息时便自己补鞋。由于这样，豫鄂陕人民解放军的纪律在陕南打了更大的胜仗。解放商雒镇时，老乡们照常赶集，解放龙驹寨后，商店下午就自动照常营业。
    【新华社晋察冀前线二十六日电】迟到消息：解放石家庄之役，解放军某部严守入城纪律，对市民秋毫无犯，所缴获之敌物资全部归公。在战斗中，某部对车站匪伪仓库内堆满之衣物及日用品等，均完整封存，并将缴获之两辆汽车衣物，悉数交给团支部。某部缴获之千余匹洋布和近亿元蒋币，亦均按数交公。新战士韩英在搜索一商店时，看见屋内无人，但对该商店内之物品丝毫未动，出来时并将店门关好。解放战士袁明星饿了一天没吃饭，拿了老百姓一块饼干，就立刻被战士郑明亮制止。某部进入一家车马大店，群众做好茶饭招待，战士们则婉言谢绝。战士对公物也极爱护，当某部向车站搜索残匪时，路经蒋记交通汽车厂，对该厂之数百辆汽车曾特留兵看守。
