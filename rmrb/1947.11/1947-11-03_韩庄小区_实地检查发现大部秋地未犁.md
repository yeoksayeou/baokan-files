    Han Zhuang District
    On-the-Spot Inspection Reveals Most Autumn Fields Unplowed
    Qin Yuan First District
    Leadership in Plowing Fields Gains Experience
    [Our Newspaper, Huguan News] On the 24th of this month, the Han Zhuang District organized a seven-person inspection team composed of village chiefs and political directors from various villages to conduct mutual inspections of autumn plowing. The inspection results showed that the entire district had a total of 17,673.72 mu of autumn fields, and 10,772.82 mu were found to be unplowed, accounting for 60.85%. In particular, the mountain gully areas were completely untouched. For example, Ma'an Village had a total of 1,459 mu of autumn fields. The village political director falsely reported that over 410 mu had been plowed, but the inspection team's actual inspection found that only over 200 mu had been plowed. Furthermore, Chuan Di Village had 1,130 mu of autumn fields. Although 450 mu were plowed, only the sides of the main roads were plowed; the areas in the gullies, mountains and shady slopes of Chuan Di were not plowed at all. Due to the poor autumn harvest, people in Chengzhai, Ma'an and other villages have been making iron and working in kilns to earn money, and they do not plan to plow, thinking they can do it next spring. The inspection team's research identified two reasons: first, some cadres lack sufficient understanding of autumn plowing and hold task-oriented views; second, due to this year's poor harvest, the masses do have demands for developing sideline occupations, neglecting autumn plowing and even becoming paralyzed, intending to plow next year. Based on the above situation, it was decided to conduct another in-depth inspection, focusing on: (1) going deep into the poor peasant and hired labor communities to understand the difficulties of autumn plowing and provide specific assistance to solve them; (2) inspecting the mountain gully shady slope areas to ensure that every plot is plowed; (3) organizing manpower to launch a concentrated assault on autumn plowing; and (4) repeatedly explaining the importance of autumn plowing to the masses, emphasizing that this year's autumn plowing is the guarantee of next year's large-scale production movement, as the saying goes: "An eighty-year-old man never forgets to plow the autumn fields." Another all-out effort will be made to organize a concentrated assault on autumn plowing, to be completed before the 20th day of the ninth lunar month. (Su Li, Hong Ren, Bao Shan, Tian Fu)
    [Our Newspaper, Taiyue, 29th Dispatch] The Qin Yuan First District, at the cadre meeting of the four basic point districts of Zhong Yu, Lu Er Hui, Yuan Shang, and Wang Jia Yuan, initially summarized ten days of autumn plowing work and derived the following points of experience:
    1. Overcoming the ideas of village cadres and the masses who are late in plowing, and those who think they can't finish plowing due to a lack of livestock power, as well as addressing the phenomenon of non-leadership and allowing things to drift. When the district cadres in Lu Er Hui proposed to harvest one plot and plow one plot, Wang Kao Wen and Guo Shuan Yin of Wang Jia Yuan wanted to haul coal a few more times before plowing. Chang Le Village organized twelve teams of livestock, but only six teams went to the fields, the rest were hauling and selling coal. It was very obvious that everyone did not pay attention to autumn plowing and could not take immediate action. After the leadership discovered these ideas, they immediately seized the opportunity to use the practical experience of the masses to change everyone's thinking. At the mass meeting in Wang Jia Yuan, District Chief Guo Tianhe repeatedly explained the seasonality of autumn plowing using the proverb "The seasons wait for no one," and that this autumn has had a lot of rain and early freezing, so if it's too late, the ground will freeze and you won't be able to plow, and next year's harvest will be reduced. He also put forward practical examples of different harvests with and without autumn plowing for everyone to discuss, thereby changing everyone's thinking. The next day, twenty teams of livestock went to the fields. Because Bei Yuan Village had a lot of land and few livestock, they had no confidence in autumn plowing and became discouraged, but the mutual aid team leader Wang Chang promoted everywhere that "Man can conquer nature," organized manpower to dig the ground, and overcame the idea that they couldn't plow without livestock power. The whole village was a scene of enthusiastic activity with both cattle plowing and people digging.
    2. Launching an autumn plowing merit campaign. Seriously carrying out autumn plowing inspections between villages. At the production committee activist meeting convened at the beginning of the autumn harvest, the entire district clearly proposed that cadres should earn merit in the autumn harvest and autumn plowing, and formulated specific merit plans. Around the 20th, district cadres, in coordination with village cadres, went to the fields with each other to actually inspect the autumn harvest and autumn plowing situation, greatly promoting this work. After the inspection of Dong Jia Village, five teams of livestock went to the fields the next day for autumn plowing. Xue Meng also organized manpower and livestock power, without distinction of yours and mine, plowing one plot at a time from the inside out, and initially named Wang Jia Yuan and Mu Hua Yuan as model villages, and Si Wei, Bei Yuan, Lu Er Hui and other villages as first-class, stimulating the chairman of the Dong Jia Village Farmers' Association to say: "This won't do, we can't fall behind, I will earn merit in autumn plowing!" These models were promptly commended. The district office specifically issued an autumn plowing circular, and each village also made commendations on the public blackboard. After commending the Li Yu Long Brigade of Lu Er Hui, Wang Jia Yuan was immediately motivated to work harder at plowing the fields.
    3. Appointing dedicated personnel to take charge and strengthen autumn plowing leadership. Lu Er Hui organized a shock autumn plowing committee, with the production director specifically responsible for leading the autumn plowing, discovering and solving various problems in autumn plowing. Similarly, Wang Jia Yuan organized more than twenty old men into four squads, selected four cattle team leaders, specializing in arranging plowing and calculating labor, which strengthened the lower-level leadership and overcame drifting.
    4. Equivalent exchange of labor and livestock power solved the difficulty of lacking livestock power. The method of exchanging labor was determined by the masses in each village through discussion. In Lu Er Hui, one day of plowing was worth three workdays, and the cattle owner plus one person was worth four workdays. The cattle owner was not responsible for the fodder, and the landowner provided six sheng of fodder and thirty jin of grass. In Wang Jia Yuan, the cattle owner plus one person plowing one mu was worth two person-days, but the cattle owner brought his own fodder. This way, the people benefited, the land benefited, and the cattle owner benefited even more, and no one was at a disadvantage, which improved labor efficiency. (Ming Ying)

    韩庄小区
    实地检查发现大部秋地未犁
    沁源一区
    领导垡地获经验
    【本报壶关讯】本月二十四日，韩庄小区组织各村村长政治主任等七人检查团，分赴各村互相检查秋耕。检查结果，全小区秋地共有一万七千六百七十三亩七分二，发现没犁的地有一万零七百七十二亩八分二，占百分之六十点八五，特别是山沟地，根本没动，如马安村共有秋地一千四百五十九亩，该村政治主任虚报已犁四百一十余亩，经检查团实际检查，只犁二百余亩，又川底村秋地一千一百三十亩，虽犁地四百五十亩，只犁了大路两边，川底、山沟阴背地根本未犁，城寨、马安等村因秋景不好，群众都打铁下窑赚钱去了，不计划犁，以为有明年春天。经检查团研究原因有二：一、部分干部对秋耕认识不足，存有任务观点；二、因今年年景不好，群众确有发展副业要求，忽视秋耕，甚至麻痹，要等明年再犁。根据以上情况，决定再次深入检查，重点是：（一）深入贫雇，了解秋耕困难，具体帮助解决；（二）检查山沟阴背地，做到块块犁完；（三）组织人力突击秋耕；（四）在群众中反复说明秋耕重要，今年秋耕是明年大生产运动的保证，俗话说：“八十老汉不忘秋垡地。”再次全力组织秋耕突击，于阴九月二十日前完成。（苏里、虹仁、保山、天福）
    【本报太岳二十九日电】沁源一区在中裕、鹿儿回、垣上、王家园四基点区干部会议上，初步总结了十天的秋垡工作，得出下列几点经验：
    一、打通村干部及群众的迟犁与畜力少犁不完的思想，以及采取不领导听任自流的现象。鹿儿回在区干部提出要收一块犁一块的时候，王家园的王考文、郭拴银要先拉几回炭再垡地，常乐村组织起来十二犋牲口，只有六犋上地，其余都是拉炭卖炭；很显然的，大家对秋垡不重视，不能马上行动起来。领导上发现这些思想后，立刻抓紧时机，用群众的切身经验来打通大家的思想。区长郭天和同志在王家园群众大会上，以“节令不饶人”的俗语，反复说明秋垡的季节性，与今秋雨多上冻早，如果太迟地冻了就不能垡，明年的收成就要减少，并提出秋垡与不秋垡不同收成的实际例子，让大家讨论，以此打通了大家思想，第二天即有二十犋牲口上了地。北园村因为地多牲口少，对秋垡没有信心，泄了气，但互助大队长王昌到处宣传“人定可以胜天”，组织了人力刨地，克服了无畜力就不能犁地的思想后，全村牛犁人刨闹得热火朝天。
    二、展开秋垡立功运动。认真进行村与村的秋垡检查，全区在秋收开始时召集的生产委员积极分子会议上，明确提出干部要在秋收秋耕中立功，并订出具体的立功计划，于二十日前后以区干部配合村干部，村与村互相到地里实际检查秋收秋耕情形，大大推动了这一工作。董家村经过检查后，第二天五犋牲口上地秋垡。学孟也组织人畜力，不分你我，由内向外挨一块垡一块，并初次评出了王家园牧花园等为模范村，四维、北园、鹿儿回等村为第一，刺激了董家村农会主席说：“这不行，咱不能落后呀，我在秋垡中立功！”平常对这些模范进行了及时表扬，区公所专门出了秋犁通报，各村在大众黑板上也作了表扬，经过表扬鹿儿回李玉龙大队后，立刻推动了王家园更加努力垡地。
    三、确定专人负责，加强秋犁领导，鹿儿回组织起突击秋垡委员会，生产主任专门负责领导秋垡，发现与解决秋垡中的各种问题。又如王家园把廿余个老汉组成四个分队，选出四个牛犋组长，专门负责按排犁地计工等问题，这样加强了下层领导，克服了自流。
    四、人畜力的等价变工，解决了无畜力的困难。变工办法各村都由群众讨论自定。鹿儿回是犁一天顶三工，牛主跟一人的顶四工，牛主不管草料，地主人家管六升料三十斤草，王家园则是牛主跟一人犁一亩顶二个人工，但是牛主自带草料，这样人有利，地有利，牛主更有利，都不吃亏，就提高了劳动效率。（明英）
