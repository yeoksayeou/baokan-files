　　Heroic Soldier-Killer Liang Tonghe
    On October 12th, this reporter met with Platoon Leader Liang Tonghe, a famous combat hero of the × regiment, in Liyuan Village, × County. He is from Liangchang Ke, Qi District, Pu County, and is twenty-seven years old this year. He is honest and straightforward, and a very healthy young man. As early as 1939, he participated in the War of Resistance Against Japan, serving as a guard in the 1st Regiment of the People's Army, and later as a squad leader. He was wounded three times and returned to the rear for recuperation after the Jinan battle. Last year, when Chiang Kai-shek's 5th Army attacked, he joined the Pu County Brigade, serving as a machine gunner, squad leader, and deputy platoon leader. During the Self-Defense War, he was credited four times. During the first campaign to award merit, he was selected as a first-class soldier-killing hero for his four combat assaults. The first assault was in the battle of Zhuhezai (Pu County). At that time, a regiment of the 5th Army was approaching our Pu County Brigade. He, along with Jin Yanling and Sun Xianhe, charged fiercely at the enemy with a machine gun. After a whole day of fierce fighting, they killed and wounded more than 30 enemies. The two sides retreated automatically in the evening. In the battle of Hedaodi (Pu County), two companies of the enemy's 5th Army attacked us. He covered the entire unit while fighting and retreating, killing six enemies, allowing the unit to retreat safely. In the pursuit battle of Hujiazhai, he led the charge with a machine gun, repelling more than 100 soldiers of the 5th Army, killing two enemies. In the ambush battle of Hexiwan (Pu County), he repelled more than 200 soldiers of the 5th Army, crushing the enemy's seven-day plan to plunder grain, capturing two prisoners, and seizing two rifles. When he was selected as a special-class soldier-killing hero and a model of mass work, the enemy's 41st Division attacked Yanhezai, Pu County, in four routes. Our county brigade resolutely resisted for five hours with four squads of soldiers. Finally, Sun Xianhe carried a small cannon, and he, wielding a machine gun, stubbornly charged the enemy again, covering the safe retreat of the entire village. This time, more than 60 enemies were killed. Liang Tonghe had only fifty-odd bullets left for his machine gun. In this battle, the soldiers boosted their confidence and said, "Chiang Kai-shek's regular army is nothing more than this!" In Xichang (Qi District, Pu County), he repelled more than 200 soldiers of the 5th Army, killing and wounding four enemies. In the defense battle of Zhuhetou, he crushed the offensive plan of four companies of the 5th Army, covering the safe transfer of the entire team. In these several charge battles, he always took the lead. In peacetime, he also seized the time to do mass work. In the statistics of the three months of summer alone, he carried more than 2,500 buckets of water for the people, and on one day, he carried thirty-seven buckets. Therefore, he not only ensured that the landlord's jar was full, but also ensured that the landlord's neighbors had water to drink. As for helping the masses with land reform, wheat threshing, and manure collection, there were even more instances. For the fourth time, he was selected as a first-class soldier-killing hero because he completed three combat missions. The first was the encounter battle in Dongxi Zhucun (Yanjin). The enemy used four machine guns to block and attack us. He led a platoon of soldiers to defeat Wang Sanzhu's blockade of more than 200 men, capturing one enemy and seizing one rifle and 125 rounds of ammunition. The second time was during the Weiqiuji battle. More than 200 members of the Yanjin Security Regiment, on the walls, were firing at us with two machine guns. At that time, he led a platoon wielding machine guns, bravely charged towards the enemy. The enemy could not withstand it and retreated, and we quickly occupied Weiqiuji. The last time was in the Liyuan battle, when he led a platoon to complete the task of blocking the enemy. In these twelve battles, only one person was slightly injured in the Weiqiuji battle. In the Fifth and Fourth Units of our Yubei, when the name "Liang Tonghe" was mentioned, the soldiers all praised him with a thumbs-up, and they all hoped that he could attend the military region's hero model conference. Platoon Leader Liang Tonghe said to the reporter during the interview: "The bravery and tenacity of the soldiers in my platoon gave me great encouragement. They have all made personal plans to kill the enemy and win merit. Their plan is 'We won't go home until we defeat Chiang Kai-shek!'" Speaking of this, Platoon Leader Liang said happily: "Naturally, I will lead them to complete this merit-making plan together." (Jilu Yu Branch)

　　杀敌英雄梁同合
    十月十二日记者于×县梨园村会见了名闻×团的战斗英雄梁同合排长。他是濮县七区梁昌渴人，今年二十七岁，性情坦白直率，是很健康的壮年。远在一九三九年，他就参加了抗日战争，曾在民军一团任警卫员，后又任班长，先后负伤三次，济宁战斗后回后方休养。去年蒋匪五军进攻，他又参加了濮县大队，历任机枪射手、班长、副班长、排长之职。在自卫战争当中，他立功四次。第一次立功运动时，他四次战斗突击被选为一等杀敌英雄。第一次突击是在猪河寨（濮县）战斗。当时五军有一个团向我濮县大队逼进，他端着机枪和晋延岭、孙仙鹤一同向敌猛烈冲击，经过一整天的激烈战斗，毙伤敌人三十余名，至天晚双方才自动撤退。在河道堤（濮县）战斗时，敌五军有两个连向我进攻，他掩护全部且战且退，毙敌六名，使部队安全的退下来。在虎家寨的追击战里，他提着机枪在头里击退了五军一百多人，打死敌人两名。河西湾（濮县）埋伏战中，打退了五军二百多，粉碎了敌人七天的抢粮计划，并捉俘虏两名，得步枪两枝。他被选为特等杀敌英雄和群众工作模范的时候，敌四一师分四路向濮县盐河寨进攻，我县大队以四个班兵力坚决的抵抗了五小时，最后孙仙鹤托着小炮，他端着机枪，又顽强的向敌人冲击，才掩护全村百姓安全的撤退下来。这一次打死了敌人六十多名。梁同合的机枪、子弹打的只剩了五十多粒了，在这一战斗里，战士们都提高了信心说：“老蒋的正规军也不过如此！”在西昌（濮县七区）打退了五军二百多，毙伤敌人四名。在注河头的保卫战中，粉碎了五军四个连的进攻计划，掩护了全队的安全转移。这几次冲锋战斗，他没有不是突击在前的。在平时，他还能抓紧群众工作，就在夏季三个月的统计中，他给百姓担水二千五百余担，有一天就担了三十七担。因此，不光保证了房东的缸满，也保证了房东的邻居有水吃。至于帮助群众土改、打麦、拾粪等工作，那就更多了。第四次立功，他又被选为一等杀敌英雄。因为他完成了三次战斗任务。第一次是东西祝村（延津）遭遇战，敌人用四挺机枪堵击我们，他带领着一排战士击溃了王三祝二百余人的堵击，又捉敌一名，缴步枪一枝、子弹一百二十五发。第二次是在魏邱集战斗时，伪延津保安团二百余人，在围墙上用两挺机枪向我射击，当时他带着一个排提着机枪勇猛的向敌人冲去，敌人不支，撤退就跑，我们迅速的占领了魏邱集。最后一次在梨园战斗时，他带一个排完成了堵击敌人的任务。在这十二次战斗里，只魏邱集战斗时，我轻伤一名。在豫北我五四部队里提起“梁同合”三字，战士们都用大姆指来称赞，都希望他能去参加军区英模大会。梁同合排长和记者谈话时说：“俺排战士的英勇顽强，给了我莫大的鼓舞。他们都订了个人杀敌立功计划，他们的计划是‘不打倒蒋介石不回家！’”说到这里，梁排长高兴的说：“自然，我要领导他们，一块完成这个立功计划。”（冀鲁豫分社）
