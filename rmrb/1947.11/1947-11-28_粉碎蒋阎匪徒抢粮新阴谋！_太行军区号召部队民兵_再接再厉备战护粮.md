　　Smash the New Conspiracy of the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan Bandits to Seize Grain!
　　Taihang Military Region Calls on Troops and Militia
	Make Further Efforts to Prepare for War and Protect Grain
　　[This newspaper, Taihang, 26th dispatch] The Military Region Headquarters here issued a circular to the entire region on the 15th, calling on armed forces and the broad masses of the militia in all areas to make further efforts, launch a grain protection struggle, thoroughly prepare for war, and starve the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandit troops to death. The circular pointed out: "The Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandit troops, who are extremely short of grain, have recently been transferring troops and generals, and are actively preparing to seize grain from our area. At the beginning of September, when the autumn crops matured one after another in various places, the bandit troops used small units to cover fleeing landlords, robbing day and night. Later, they even put forward the slogan of 'eating ready-made food', using the main force to penetrate deep into our hinterland to station and seize the autumn harvest, successively carrying out destructive grain seizures in Xiqugou, Shenjiagang, Dongcun, Liusi near Anyang, Fancun near Taigu, and Yanglvchuan area of ​​Huixian County. Each time they dispatched over a thousand people. Some places did not pay attention to war preparation early, resulting in losses. Recently, in order to save their dying fate, the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandit troops are plotting a large-scale grab. The puppet county magistrate of Jixian County convened a meeting of the heads of the 'Returning Home Teams,' puppet township chiefs, and intelligence team leaders on the 8th of this month to divide up the grain seizure areas, and demanded ten carts from each bao; Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Anyang City also demanded more than a thousand civilian laborers from the villages around the city on the 12th, attempting to竄扰 (cuàn rǎo) our Shuiye and Guantai. Therefore, troops in all areas should immediately launch propaganda on war preparation and emptying of houses to the masses, thoroughly do a good job in hiding grain and preparing for war, cooperate with battalion soldiers and militia, actively attack, launch a grain protection movement, and starve the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops to death.
　　[This newspaper, Taiyue, 26th dispatch] The local armed forces and militia of Jiexiu, after removing the Shangliang stronghold, on the 13th of this month, a unit of the Jiexiu Independent Battalion and the militia rotational warfare team ambushed more than 30 puppet bandit bao and village armed personnel in Jinli Village. In just a few tens of minutes, they seized one machine gun, one small cannon, three rifles, more than a hundred rounds of ammunition, stabbed to death seven bandits, and captured one alive. Another unit of the battalion, earlier on the 12th, cooperated with a detachment of the First District and the ×× militia to ambush the Yan bandit's Police Second Brigade in Suncun, using interwoven firepower of machine guns, rifles, and grenades, killing four bandits, wounding five, capturing two alive, and seizing one rifle. And within a week, they twice defeated the enemy's grain grabbing at Qinshudi. First, on November 2nd, the Yan bandit's 45th Division, 3rd Regiment, 2nd Battalion, and more than 20 members of the "Good People's Group" went from Jingsheng to Qinshudi to seize grain, and were ambushed by the ××× militia, who used mobile tactics. Two grenades killed and wounded three bandits and seized one rifle; on the 7th, more than 30 members of the "Good People's Group" from the Shijiao bandits of Lingshi went to Qinshudi again to seize grain, and were again ambushed by the guerrilla group, killing one bandit, wounding two, and seizing one machine gun.
　　[This newspaper, Yexian News] The county armed forces held the second term of the blasting training class on the 31st of last month. The training period expired on the 11th of this month. A total of 54 students have now returned to their villages to lay mines to protect grain. During the study, the leaders first carried out current affairs enlightenment and grievance education, such as telling the end of the Yongnian remnants, which everyone listened to with great interest. They also induced the students to express their grievances, such as Zhang Youli, a militia member of the Fourth District, tearfully recounting how Wang Ziquan buried his mother alive, and Li Shenger of the First District recounting how his father was killed by Wang Ziquan, arousing hatred for the enemy. At this time, the slogan "Avenge your parents" was put forward, and everyone's emotions became even higher. Later, they proposed self-teaching, self-training, and mutual learning, promoting everyone's creativity, and overcoming the idea of ​​teaching and learning. Under the slogan of "bitter thinking, bitter learning, and bitter practice," everyone created 18 or 19 new mine-laying methods such as "monkey jumping well" and "sticking to the edge." The original methods were also further transformed. At the same time, the technology was also improved, and everyone felt that it was better than the dead method of teaching a few things and learning a few things.
　　At this time, everyone felt that they had learned the skills. The leaders also reviewed the past problems of the blasting movement that could not be carried out. After everyone's discussion, it was decided that they must watch the mine after it was buried, people go and mines go, and cold shots must be combined with landmines to guide the enemy into the minefield. All the students were full of confidence in victory and made plans to kill the enemy and perform meritorious deeds. Districts challenged each other, laid mines to protect grain, and went deep behind enemy lines to actively annihilate the enemy.

    【本报太岳二十六日电】介休地方武装与民兵，继拔掉上梁据点之后，本月十三日，介休独立营一部和民兵轮战队，于靳里村伏击伪匪保和乡村武装三十余人，仅数十分钟，即缴获机枪一挺、小炮一门、步枪三支、子弹百余发、刺杀匪徒七名、活捉一名，该营另一部，先于十二日配合一区分队与××民兵，在孙村伏击阎匪之保警二大队，以机步枪及手榴弹的交织火力，击毙匪徒四名，伤五名、生俘两名，缴步枪一支。并于一周内在秦树底两次击溃敌人抢粮，首先，十一月二日，阎匪四五师三团二营与“好人团”二十余人，从静升至秦树底抢粮，当被×××民兵机动伏击，两颗手榴弹毙伤匪徒三名，缴步枪一支；七日，灵石之石焦匪徒“好人团”三十余人，再至秦树底抢粮，又遭游击小组伏击，毙匪徒一名，伤二名，缴机枪一挺。
    【本报邺县讯】县武于上月三十一日召开了第二期爆炸训练班，本月十一日训练期满，学员共五十四名，现已纷纷回村埋雷护粮。学习中，领导上首先进行了时事启发诉苦教育，如讲永年残匪的下场，大家都是听的津津有味，又诱导学员诉苦，如四区民兵张有礼，流着眼泪诉说王自全活埋了他娘，一区李生儿诉他父亲被王自全害死，激起了对敌仇恨心。这时即提出：“为父母报仇”的口号，个个情绪越发高涨。后来又提出自教自练互相学习，发扬大家的创造性，克服教啥学啥的思想，大家在“苦想、苦学、苦练”的口号下，创造了“猴跳井”，“占边黏”等十八、九种新的埋雷方法，原有的方法也经进一步改造，同时，在技术上也提高了，均感到比教几样学几样的死办法好。
    这时都感到学会了本领，领导上又检讨了过去爆炸运动不能开展的毛病，经大家讨论，决定埋上雷一定要看，人走雷走，冷枪必须结合地雷，引导敌人上雷网等办法。各学员充满胜利信心，都订出了杀敌立功计划，区与区并互相挑战竞赛，埋雷护粮，并深入敌后，主动歼敌。
