Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's pseudo-National Assembly representative "general election," after being postponed once, was held from the 21st to the 23rd of this month. The broad masses of the people in the Chiang-controlled areas expressed extreme contempt for it. The pseudo-election once again proved the political bankruptcy of Chiang Kai-shek and his running dogs, the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party. Before the pseudo-election, the open quarrel between the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party and their master over the division of "National Assembly representative" quotas had already ended under the pressure of the Chiang party. Although the Chiang side greatly reduced the number of pseudo-National Assembly representatives of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party, for example, the Chiang side originally promised to give the Democratic Socialist Party 260 seats, but when it announced at the beginning of the month that it would only give them 141, the Democratic Socialist Party also declared on the 7th that it "agreed."

The pseudo-election has ended on the 23rd. The three days of pseudo-election fully exposed the ugly face of Chiang Kai-shek's anti-people, corrupt, and reactionary rule. According to a Reuters dispatch from Shanghai on the 23rd: "According to available information, most of the voters throughout the Chiang-controlled areas are professional politicians of the Kuomintang (Chiang), Youth, and Democratic Socialist parties and their relatives and close supporters, as well as people from (puppet) professional organizations." An Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 23rd also mocked the Chiang bandit authorities' estimate of 200 million voters, saying, "Neutral observers doubt whether it can reach 100 million votes."

According to a report by Agence France-Presse, well-informed sources said that only 15 to 20 percent of the registered voters in Nanjing participated in the pseudo-election. An Agence France-Presse reporter counted only 20 people voting at a certain polling station in one hour. At another polling station, the number of participants in the pseudo-election only reached 10 percent of the voters at that station, and most of them were soldiers. Soldiers went to vote in entire companies, and the vast majority of soldiers in each company only voted for one candidate, which shows that they were forced to vote. In the so-called women's "election," administrators allowed female children to vote, and instead of voting once, they voted multiple times.

According to Reuters: On the 21st, all the pseudo-election polling stations in Shanghai were almost empty and deserted throughout the morning. The administrator of the polling station in front of the Chiang Kai-shek Municipal Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, the most densely populated area, admitted that only a dozen people had voted several hours after the start of voting. Several coolies in Shanghai told Agence France-Presse reporters that they had never heard of "elections" and had never registered on the "election" voter list. The vast majority of pseudo-election ballots have become commodities bought and sold by Chiang bandit officials. According to Agence France-Presse: "Out of the 2,000 ballots at a polling station in Shanghai, only 400 were distributed to voters, and the rest have disappeared." When hundreds of people learned that they had been used by the Baojia chiefs for "ballot" trading, they gathered at the polling station and raised angry questions, forcing the Chiang bandit authorities to admit: "The personnel responsible for distributing the ballots illegally sold the ballots."

Some polling stations in Beiping were so deserted that only five or six people were voting. According to Agence France-Presse: The Chiang bandit puppet women's organization in Beiping brought about fifty prostitutes to the polling station to cast pre-written ballots.

In the Qingdao pseudo-election, the ballots were distributed in advance to the designated candidates. A certain important person of the Chiang party in Nanjing telegraphed Ge Yichun, the chairman of the Chiang party Qingdao municipal party headquarters, twice on the 21st, shamelessly claiming: "The 'National Assembly representative' candidates from the Eastern District press circles have all been presumed; the Qingdao press circles have a total of 340 votes, and it has been agreed to divide them equally among Ma Xingye, Feng Youzhen, Yang Junming of the Democratic Socialist Party, and Song Yiqing of the Youth Party. Please do so."

According to a Reuters dispatch from Shanghai: The Shenyang pseudo-election was particularly brutal. "In Shenyang, groups of organized people went from house to house collecting resident permits and voting on behalf of hundreds of heads of households at polling stations." In Hankou and other cities, such so-called "candidate door-to-door campaigns" were also launched. The Chiang bandit authorities in Kunming arrested several students and professors from Yunnan University as a prelude to the pseudo-election, fully exposing the fascist and anti-people nature of the Chiang bandit pseudo-election.

Public opinion in the Chiang-controlled areas generally believes that the "National Assembly general election" farce staged by Chiang Kai-shek and his gang of jackals is a hundred times more shameless than Cao Kun's piglet parliament election. Even McCormick, the publisher of the Chicago Tribune, who recently came to China and fanatically advocated aiding Chiang and opposing communism, could not conceal this point. He told Associated Press reporters in Shanghai on the 22nd that the current "general election" of Chiang Kai-shek was "an election controlled by massacre or the threat of massacre."

　　蒋党伪选丑态百出
  　北平选站冷落硬拉妓女来凑数
    沈阳挨家搜集居民证代人投票
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】蒋家匪帮的伪国民大会代表“普驯，经一度延期后，已于本月二十一日至二十三日举行。蒋管区广大人民对之均极表蔑视，伪选只是再一度证明了蒋介石及其走狗民、青两党的政治破产。在伪选之前，民、青两乞丐党与其主子间为“国大代表”名额的分贼问题的公然吵嚷，已在蒋党的压力下宣告结束，虽然蒋方将民、青两党的伪国代名额大大削减，例如蒋方原答应给予民社党二百六十名席位，但月初宣布只给他一百四十一名时，民社党亦已于七日宣称“同意”。
    伪选业已于二十三日结束。三天的伪选中，充分暴露了蒋介石反人民腐败反动统治的丑态。据路透社上海二十三日电报导：“根据现有的消息，全蒋管区各地大多数的投票者都是国（蒋）、青、民三党的职业政客及他们的亲戚与亲密的拥护者，以及（御用）职业团体的人们”。美联社南京二十三日电，亦嘲笑蒋匪当局所谓有二万万选民投票的估计，说“中立观察家都怀疑是否能达到一万万张选票的数字。”
    据法新社报导，消息灵通人士说，南京登记的选民中只有百分之十五至二十参加伪选的投票，法新社记者在一小时中数一数到某投票站投票的人只有二十人。在另一个投票站，参加伪选人数只达该站投票者百分之十，而且大多数都是军人，士兵们成连地整队前往投票，每一连绝大多数士兵都只投一个候选人，足见他们是被强迫投票的。在所谓妇女“选举”中，管理员允许女小孩投票，而且不是投一次票而是投多次的票。
    据路透社称：二十一日上海所有伪选投票站，几乎整个上午都是空寂无人，处于人口最稠密的沪市蒋记市商会门前的投票站管理员承认：投票开始后数小时仅有十来人投了票。上海好几位苦力告法新社记者说，他们从未听说过“选举”，也从没有在“选举”人名册上登记过。伪选选票绝大部分均成了蒋匪官员们买卖的商品，据法新社称：“上海一个投票站的二千张选票，仅有四百张分给选民，其他都已不翼而飞”。当数百人知道他们为保甲长利用作“选票”买卖时，即集合投票站提出愤怒的质问，迫使蒋匪当局不得不承认：“负责分配选票的人员，非法地卖掉了选票”。
    北平的某些投票站冷落到只有五、六个人在投票，据法新社报导：北平的蒋匪御用妇女团体曾弄了五十来个妓女到投票站投预先写好的选票。
    青岛伪选事先即将选票分给圈定的候选人，南京蒋党某要人于二十一日两度致电蒋党青市党部主委葛挹纯，恬不知耻地声称：“东区新闻界‘国大代表’候选人均经推定；青市新闻界共有三百四十张选票，经商定平均分给马星野、冯有真、民社党杨浚明、青年党宋益清，务请照办。”
    据路透社上海消息：沈阳伪选尤为凶暴，“在沈阳，成群的有组织的人，挨家搜集居民证到投票站代数百家家长投票。”在汉口及其他城市亦展开了这样的所谓“候选人逐屋奔走运动。”昆明蒋匪当局以逮捕云南大学学生及教授数人，作为伪选前奏，充分暴露出蒋匪伪选的法西斯反人民性质。
    蒋管区社会舆论咸认此次蒋介石狐群狗党所上演的“国代普选”丑剧，较之曹锟的猪仔议会选举更无耻百倍。此点甚至连新近来华，狂热主张援蒋反共的美国芝加哥论坛报发行人麦克米克亦无法掩饰，彼于二十二日在上海对美联社记者谈话时，将目前蒋介石的“大选”称为“被屠杀或以屠杀威胁所控制的一种选举。”
