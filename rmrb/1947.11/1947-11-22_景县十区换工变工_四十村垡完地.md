　　Jing County Tenth District: Labor Exchange and Transformation
　　Forty Villages Finish Plowing
　　[Our newspaper's report from Southern Hebei, 20th] The Tenth District of Jing County implemented labor exchange and transformation, with forty villages completing the autumn plowing. When the autumn harvest and wheat planting in various villages of the district were nearing completion, a meeting of village chiefs and peasant association directors was held. It was pointed out that, in the past, due to neglecting leadership, the autumn land of some elderly, weak, and unproductive poor masses had been left uncultivated. In order to prevent insect plagues next year and lay the foundation for spring sowing, the autumn land must be universally plowed before the Beginning of Winter. Village cadres returned to their villages and immediately took the lead in launching a campaign. Many villages carried out labor exchanges, with those who had livestock plowing the land for those who did not, and those who did not have livestock threshing for those who did. Some villages also implemented large-scale labor transformations. For example, in Sheng堂 Village, one hundred and ten households organized forty plows, divided into four groups, and decided on the order of plowing based on the quality of the soil and the speed of work. The village had eight hundred mu of autumn land besides wheat fields, all of which were plowed in six and a half days. Currently, all forty villages in the district have generally completed plowing.
　　[Our newspaper's report from Southern Hebei, 18th] The Mutual Aid Brigade of Dazhai Village in the Fourth District of Qiu County adjusted manpower, livestock, and agricultural implements to solve the difficulties of poor peasants, seizing the time to launch a winter plowing campaign. The poor peasants all know the benefits of winter plowing, but because the leadership composition has not been purely reformed, the difficulties of the poor peasants have not been resolved promptly enough, preventing the smooth progress of plowing. After Xing Zhenhua conducted in-depth investigations, he first convened a meeting of poor peasants from each group, gathering together the various difficulties the poor peasants faced in winter plowing. On the evening of the 7th, he convened a joint meeting of production committee members and group leaders to specifically discuss solutions to these difficulties. The whole village's ten mutual aid groups had a total of one thousand three hundred and fifty-two mu of barren land, twenty-six head of cattle, two donkeys, eighteen plows, and nine harrows. After subtracting the two hundred mu already plowed, each plow still had sixty mu of barren land to plow. Assuming a plow can plow three mu a day (large plow), it would still take twenty days to plow everything. "If it doesn't snow lightly, you can't plow; if it doesn't snow heavily, you can't boat," so if a campaign is not launched, the barren land will not be eliminated. After calculating this, it was decided that all manpower, livestock, and agricultural implements should be put into the campaign. Groups with more livestock and fewer harrows and groups with fewer livestock and more harrows were to adjust with each other. Households not in groups also voluntarily combined. Widows and bachelors exchanged labor, with the bachelors plowing for the widows, and the widows making cotton clothes, shoes, and socks for the bachelors. It was also decided to first adjust livestock and plow the land for poor military dependents who had no livestock. During the winter plowing campaign, livestock were not allowed to be idle for even a day except when on official duties. Groups without flour for food helped each other by pushing the mill. After solving these difficulties, the poor peasants led the middle peasants, and production morale greatly improved. Six or seven households bought cattle and proposed to carry out deep plowing and multiple harrowing.

　　景县十区换工变工
  　四十村垡完地
    【本报冀南二十日电】景县十区实行换工、变工、四十村耕完秋地。该区各村秋收种麦将完时，召开了村长、农会主任会议。指出：过去由于忽视领导，曾将一些老弱无生产力的贫苦群众的秋地抛下未耕。为防止明年的虫灾与打下明春下种的基础，在立冬前秋地要普遍耕完。村干回村，即带头进行突击。很多的村庄进行换工，有牲口的给无牲口的耕地，无牲口的给有牲口打场。还有的村实行了大变工，如圣堂村一百一十户，组织了四十张犁，共分为四组，并根据地质好坏，干的快慢，决定先耕与后耕。全村除麦田外，还有八百亩秋地，六天半的时间，全部耕完。现全区四十个村子已普遍耕完。
    【本报冀南十八日电】邱县四区大寨村互助大队调剂人畜农具解决贫农困难，抢时突击冬耕。贫农都知道冬耕的好处，但因领导成份改造的还不纯洁，对贫农困难解决仍不够及时，致不能顺利进行耕地。经邢振华深入了解后，首先召集各组贫农会议，把贫农冬耕中的各种困难集中起来。七日晚又召集生产委员及各组长联席会，具体商讨解决这些困难。全村十个互助组，共一千三百五十二亩白地，二十六头牛，两头驴，十八张犁，九张耙。除已犁完二百亩外，每张犁还合六十亩白地。一张犁一天（大晌犁）按犁三亩算，还须二十天犁完。“小雪不行犁、大雪不行船”，如不进行突击，白地消灭不完。经这样算帐后，决定人畜力农具全部投入突击运动中。牲口多犁耙少，和牲口少犁耙多的组互相调剂；白地多牲口少与白地少牲口多的组互相调剂，几户不在组的，也自愿结合起来。寡妇与光棍汉互相换工，光棍汉给她犁地，她给光棍汉做棉衣、鞋、袜。并决定先调剂牲口，给没牲口的贫苦军工属犁地。在突击冬耕中，除支差外，不叫牲口闲一天。没面吃的各组，互助推磨。解决这些困难后，贫农带领中农，生产情绪大大提高，有六、七户买了牛，提出要作到深犁多耙。
