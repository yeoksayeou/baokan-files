In the Moscow region, 1,200 factories completed their annual plans before the 7th. Stalingrad, which was completely destroyed during the war, also had several industries completing their annual plans, with the pharmaceutical industry exceeding the annual plan by 4.3% on October 28. The output of the Stalingrad Tractor Factory in October has reached the pre-war level. The largest heavy machinery factory in the Urals region also completed its annual plan before the festival. The Soviet inland water transport industry completed its annual plan at the end of October, with a total navigable distance now exceeding 100,000 kilometers, an increase of 50% compared to three years ago. The Black Sea shipping industry also completed its annual plan at the same time. The labor productivity of workers in various industries has greatly increased, such as the workers in the aforementioned inland water transport, whose labor productivity increased by 31% this year alone. Most astonishingly, Vasin, a lathe operator at the Ordzonikidze Factory in Chelyabinsk, due to improved technology and the use of a specially designed machine of his own, completed the entire output of the first three years of the five-year plan in the twenty months before October, and plans to complete another fourteen and a half months of output by the end of the year.
