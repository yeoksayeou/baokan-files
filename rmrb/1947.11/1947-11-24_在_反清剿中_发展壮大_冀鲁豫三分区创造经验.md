The Jilu豫 Third Military Sub-district Creates Experience

[Reported from Jilu豫 on the 22nd of this month] The headquarters of the Jilu豫 Third Military Sub-district has summarized the patriotic self-defense struggle of the past year, achieving magnificent results and gaining six major experiences. The summary first pointed out that the Huxi area has persevered through extremely tense anti-"suppression" and anti-"mopping-up" operations. Before July, it frequently contained an entire reorganized division and seven security regiments of the enemy. During the year, it underwent three major "seesaw battles" and multiple anti-"suppression" and anti-"mopping-up" operations, smashing the enemy's "nibbling" strategy this spring and restoring and constructing the base area. This is the result of the concerted efforts of the Party, government, army, and people, who were not afraid of hardship or sacrifice, and bravely and tenaciously fought against the enemy. It must be admitted that military struggle is of great significance: First, it controlled the vast area west of Feng (County), Jin (Xiang), and Yu (Tai), and to restore this area, in the past winter and this spring, we only used a certain army corps and the armed forces of various counties and districts to conduct three major battles, effectively annihilating the enemy's 88th Division and 70th Division. Because the enemy's strength was too great, we repeatedly inserted and withdrew. Later, in coordination with local work, we carried out three major tasks—land reform, tunnel construction, and control of rural positions. When the enemy came, we tried our best to crush the enemy's "suppression," and whenever there was a gap, we took the initiative to attack the enemy, carry out land reform, build tunnels, and suppress bad elements. On the basis of these three major tasks, after repeated anti-"suppression" and anti-"mopping-up" operations, we were able to consolidate our position. Second, the armed forces have been developed and their combat effectiveness greatly improved. For example, a certain regiment fought mobile warfare and annihilated one and a half companies of the enemy's regular army; five companies of a certain regiment annihilated two companies of the enemy's regular army; the Ju'nan Brigade was only established for half a year, but it defeated a battalion of Chiang Kai-shek's 70th Division, and also repelled an attack by an enemy with seven times our strength; a district team in Hua砀 County relied on tunnels to repel an attack by more than 6,000 enemies; and a company of the Pei County Brigade persisted in Nanyang, fighting a bloody battle with three enemy battalions for a whole day. Facts have proved that we can not only defeat the enemy, but also annihilate them. In the battles, certain army corps expanded to two or three times their original size, and new army corps and two county brigades were established, four county brigades were restored and strengthened, and the weapons and equipment were greatly improved, with sufficient machine guns universally equipped, and artillery was created. In terms of tactics, cadres at all levels have learned to organize firepower, use terrain, and use encirclement and quick battles to solve the enemy. Third, it has trained cadres and established a tenacious belief in struggle. In the past year, cadres have undergone great changes from pessimism and disappointment to determination to persevere, and then to tenacious perseverance in struggle. At the beginning, there was a great retreat, and it was generally believed that the enemy was powerful and could not be resisted. At this time, the typical example of Li Rutai's tenacious persistence appeared. After the leadership consciously cultivated him, he brought along many cadres. Later, meetings were held to solve ideological problems, so that cadres knew that they must persevere, and discipline was emphasized. After the three major tasks and several victorious battles, confidence was generally improved, especially the several tunnel battles in Hua砀, which repelled the enemy. After breaking the idea of relying on the army corps, since this summer, county and district armed forces have been persisting in active struggle one or two miles on both sides of the enemy's large forces. Everyone realized that it was not a question of whether they could persist, but whether they dared to persist. Regarding the experience of the past year's struggle, six points were summarized: (1) We must open up our thinking in the course of persistent struggle. It is not feasible to wait until our thinking is open before persisting; (2) A purely military point of view cannot open up the situation, and it must be combined with the three major tasks; (3) The determination to persist independently, without relying on foreign aid, is the main link in persisting in the struggle; (4) Timely praise and rewards, and strict discipline; (5) The leaders should take the lead in persisting and summarize experience in a timely manner; (6) We must believe in the creativity of the troops and let them give full play to it.

　　在“反清剿中”发展壮大
  　冀鲁豫三分区创造经验
    【本报冀鲁豫二十二日电】冀鲁豫三分区司令部，总结一年来的爱国自卫斗争，成绩宏伟，并获得六大主要经验。总结首先指出，湖西地区在极度紧张的反“清剿”、及反“扫荡”中坚持下来。七月以前，经常牵制敌人一个整编师及七个保安团队，一年中经过三次大“拉锯”及多次反“清剿”、反“扫荡”，打破了今春敌人的“蚕食”，并恢复和建设了根据地。这是党政军民协力一致对敌不怕艰苦，不怕牺牲，勇敢顽强对敌斗争得来的结果。必须承认，军事斗争是具有重大意义的：第一、控制了丰（县）金（乡）鱼（台）以西广大地区，为恢复这一地区，在去冬今春，我仅以某某兵团及各县区武装，进行了三次较大的战斗，有效的歼灭了敌八十八师和七十师的有生力量。因为敌兵力过大，我曾反复多次的插入与跳出。后来配合地方工作，进行了三大工作——土地改革、地道建设、控制农村阵地，敌人来时则全力粉碎敌之“清剿”，一有空隙就主动袭击敌人，搞土改、地道，镇压坏蛋。在这三大工作的基础上，经过反复的反“清剿”、反“扫荡”，才得到巩固。第二、武装力量得到发展，战斗力大大提高。如某团打运动战，歼敌正规军一个半连；某团五个连，歼敌正规军两个连；钜南大队成立才半年，就击溃蒋匪第七十师的一个营，并曾击退优于我七倍兵力之敌人的进攻；华砀县一个区队，则依托地道，击退六千余敌人之进攻；沛县大队一个连，坚持南阳，与敌三个营血战竟日。事实证明，我们不仅能击溃敌人，而且能歼灭敌人。在战斗中，某某两兵团扩大到两倍、三倍，又建立了新的兵团和两个县大队，四个县大队恢复壮大，武器装备也大为改善，普遍的装备了充足的机枪，并创建了炮兵。在战术上，各级干部学会了组织火力，运用地形，用包围速战解决敌人。第三、锻炼了干部，树立了顽强的斗争信念。一年来干部由悲观失望到下决心坚持，进而到顽强的坚持斗争，变化很大。开初曾大退却，普遍认为敌人厉害，不能坚持。此时出现了李汝泰顽强坚持的典型，经过领导上有意识的培养，以后带起了很多干部。后来，开会解决思想问题，使干部知道必须坚持，又强调了纪律，经过三大工作和几次胜利的战斗，信心普遍提高，特别是华砀数次地道战，均击退敌人。在打破了依靠兵团的思想后，今夏以来，在敌大部队两侧一、二里的地方，都有我县区武装坚持，积极斗争。都认识到了不是能不能坚持，而是敢不敢坚持的问题。关于一年来的斗争经验，共总结出六点：（一）必须在坚持斗争中去打通思想，等打通思想再坚持，是不行的；（二）单纯的军事观点不能打开局面，必须与三大工作相结合；（三）决心独立坚持，不依赖外援，是坚持斗争的主要环节；（四）及时表扬和奖励，严格纪律；（五）首长带头坚持，并要及时总结经验；（六）要相信部队的创造力，使其得到发挥。
