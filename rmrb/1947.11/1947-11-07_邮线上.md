	On the Postal Route
	Overcoming Difficulties to Ensure Communication
	When the enemy pressed Liangshan, Daimiao, and the Yellow River ferry crossings, the communication between the front and rear was cut off by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. Director Liu instructed Comrade Fan Deyan to find Stationmaster Dong in the Daimiao area to reopen the main line. After finding Stationmaster Dong, Stationmaster Dong told him to cross the river from Sunkou to contact the rear. At this time, the enemy in Kunshan had not left, and the Fifth Army was stationed in Yuncheng. Comrade Fan Deyan was ideologically unwavering, unafraid of sacrifice, and determined to complete the task. The journey was about forty or fifty li, the road was full of mud, and there were three or four small mud ditches, some half a person deep. Comrade Fan stepped through the mud, waded through the small swamps, crossed the dangerous Sunkou of the Yellow River, and returned at night, spending two days finding the organization. Director Feng convened a meeting of the sub-bureau and personnel from seven stations, and announced on the spot that he would be awarded a major merit.
	
	Flying Feet Yu Hongzhen
	Comrade Yu Hongzhen travels back and forth on a main line connecting with Jinnan (from Boping County to Kangzhuang in Yongzhi County), a round trip of one hundred and sixty li, with more than twenty li of sandy nests in the middle. He sets off every day after breakfast and returns at three o'clock in the afternoon, creating an unprecedented record for postal transport speed. For more than two months now, he has only failed to return on the same day once because of rain. On September 24th, it rained all day long, and the roads were extremely muddy. Our "Flying Feet" finally completed the one hundred and sixty li task at seven o'clock in the afternoon.
	
	Rather Go Hungry Than Delay the Newspaper by a Minute
	Comrade Cai Liangtian, a postal worker in Neihuang, set off for the fifth district when it was already late in the morning. Seeing that it was getting late, he didn't eat on the road and went hungry until dark before returning, saying, "If I eat on the road, it will delay the journey, and people will see the newspaper late; it doesn't matter if I go hungry, making the newspaper available a minute earlier can make each village start writing on the blackboard newspaper a minute earlier." Comrade Ma Mingyi, a postal worker in Kunwu, set off in heavy rain, ran to several villages, delivered newspapers to readers, and developed several new subscribers, all with terms of three or four months.
	
	Holding Documents on Their Heads
	Several days of overcast rain have filled the ditches and gullies, and there is water everywhere. The large depression six or seven li from Zhangpingzhuang to Zhanwa has turned into a lake. This is the only way for Pingyin County to contact the sub-bureau. Thanks to the efforts of Comrades Jiao X Ting, Zhang Xiucheng, and Zhang Xiaowu of the county bureau, communication has never been lost or missed. They go back and forth through this five or six li of waterway, which varies in depth, some almost a person deep, and some about two or three feet deep, some muddy and very slippery. Every time they pass here, they have to take off their clothes and hold the documents on their heads to cross this cold and deep water. Although it is very hard, their morale is still very high, and they have never said a word of fatigue. Under the influence of their fearless hardship and active work, they have inspired comrades throughout the bureau. (Jiluyu Branch)

    邮线上
    冲破艰险保证联系
    当敌人进逼梁山、戴庙以及黄河南渡口时，前后方的联系被蒋匪打断了。刘局长叫范德言同志，在戴庙一带，找董站长来打通干线。他找到董站长后，董站长叫他从孙口渡河，到后方联系。这时，昆山敌人未走，郓城住着五军。范德言同志在思想上毫不犹豫，不怕牺牲，坚决来完成任务。路途约四、五十里，路上满是泥泞，还有三、四个小泥沟，深的有半人深。范同志便踏过泥泞，趟过小泽沟，渡过黄河险孙口，夜间又回来，找了两天，才找到机关。冯局长召集了分局和七站人员谈话，当场宣布记大功一次。
    飞毛腿于洪祯
    于洪祯同志，在与冀南联系的一条干线（从博平县至永智县的康庄）上往返，来回一百六十里，中间还有二十余里的沙窝。每天吃早饭后出发，当天下午三点钟即返回，创造邮运速度上之空前纪录。到现在两个多月，只有一次因为下了雨，当天没有返局。九月廿四日，下了一整天雨，道路稀烂，我们的“飞毛腿”也终于在下午七点钟完成了一百六十里任务。
    宁愿自己饿一顿  不使报纸慢一分
    内黄邮工蔡良田同志，出发到五区时，天已半晌午了他看到天晚了，不在路上吃饭，饿着肚子到黑才回来，并说：“如果在路上吃饭，就耽误路子，报纸人家看到的慢；自己饿一顿没关系，使报纸早看到一分钟，能早起一分钟的作用，叫各村早写黑板报。昆吾邮工马明义同志，在大雨天出发，跑了几个村子，把报纸送到读者手里，又发展了几个订户，期限都是三、四个月。
    把文件顶在头上
    多天的阴雨，下得沟满壕平，到处是水，张平庄到展洼相距六七里的大洼里，变成了湖地，此处是平阴县往分局联系的必经之路，在县局焦×庭、张秀成、张孝五三同志努力下，并没有失掉过联系或错过时间，他们来回都经过这五六里的水路，深浅不定，深的将有一人深，浅约二、三尺，有的是泥泞，很滑，他们每过这里，就得把衣服脱光，将文件顶在头上，才能渡过这又凉又深的水，虽很辛苦，但他们情绪仍很高，从未说过半个累字。在他们不怕吃苦积极工作的影响下，鼓舞了全局同志。（冀鲁豫分社）
