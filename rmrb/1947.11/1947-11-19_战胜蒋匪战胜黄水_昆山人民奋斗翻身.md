　　Defeat Chiang's Bandits, Conquer the Yellow River
  　Kunshan People Struggle to Overcome and Transform
    [Report from Jilu Yu Front, 17th] The 220,000 people of Kunshan County, south of the Yellow River, have overcome historically rare difficulties with unparalleled heroic struggles over the past ten months, and have victoriously completed four major tasks: guerrilla warfare, rushing to control the Yellow River, supporting the front lines, and preliminary land reform. As early as January and February of this year, Kunshan County launched enthusiastic land reform and support for the front lines, with extremely high morale among the masses. After March, in the triangular area south of the Yellow River, west of the Grand Canal, and north of Liangshan, Chiang's bandits invaded the entire territory of Kunshan three times with tens of thousands of troops, carrying out the most barbaric rapes, looting, and massacres. They also used the most despicable means to return the Yellow River to its old course, bombing the dikes and dangerous works with artillery and aircraft, attempting to drown millions of people in Henan. However, the masses did not yield, overcoming all difficulties and completing the most glorious tasks. The Yellow River project alone is enough to amaze people. The riverbed, which had been dry for nine years, was already silted up, and the dikes were in disrepair. The dams of dangerous works were also destroyed by the Japanese invaders during the war of resistance, leaving only piles of ruins. But the people understood the meaning of fighting for survival. Before the wheat harvest, they overcame all difficulties and rushed to repair the Guonali dangerous works, completing one-third of the forty large dams. After the wheat harvest, the county leadership called on the entire county to mobilize, with up to 20,000 workers and 500 carts each day. The morale of the masses was unprecedentedly high. In terms of voluntary stone donations, more than 10,000 cubic meters (over 4,000 kilograms per cubic meter) were donated. The masses dismantled chicken coops, pigsties, and even houses to donate stones. A total of about 500,000 people were mobilized. Most movingly, when Chiang's bandits controlled the Yellow River during the peak flood season, the engineering team still used every means to rescue the dikes that were about to be in danger, and outstanding heroes such as Zhang Chaoyi and Liu Zhenjiang emerged. In the most arduous tasks of persisting in guerrilla warfare, supporting the front lines, and distributing land with guns, the people of Kunshan also achieved brilliant results. When the Liu-Deng and Chen-Su armies launched offensives in Henan in July and August, white flour stretchers and carts supporting the front lines flowed continuously every day. In five large-scale movements to support the front lines, the tasks were successfully completed. In the past six months, a large number of enemy-killing heroes have emerged. At the merit conference in the seventh district, more than 20 people, including Yu Qingde, were awarded the title of hero. According to the war results from June 1st to the end of October, in just five months, 13 enemies were killed, 45 enemies were wounded, 81 enemies were captured, and 2 machine guns, 1 Canadian submachine gun, rifles, short guns, bullets, various artillery shells, war horses, etc. were seized. After the masses obtained food and land, they spared no sacrifice or bloodshed, feared no difficulties, took up guns to defend their land and lives, and devoted all their efforts to controlling the Yellow River and supporting the front lines.

　　战胜蒋匪战胜黄水
  　昆山人民奋斗翻身
    【本报冀鲁豫十七日电】黄河以南昆山县二十二万群众，十个月来以无比的英勇斗争，克服了历史上罕有的困难，胜利完成了游击战争、抢治黄河、支援前线、初步土改等四大任务。远在今年一、二月间，昆山全县即展开热烈的土地改革和支援前线两大任务，群众情绪至为高涨。三月以后，黄河以南、运河以西、梁山以北的三角地带，蒋匪以数万大军三度侵入昆山全境，进行最野蛮的奸淫抢掠和屠杀，并以最卑鄙的手段放黄河归故，以大炮与飞机轰炸河堤险工，企图淹死河南数百万群众，但是群众并没有屈服，克服了一切困难，完成了最光荣的任务。仅以治黄一项来说，就足以令人惊叹。枯干了九年的河床，早就淤塞，河堤亦已破烂不堪，险工之堤坝也因抗战期间日寇的破坏，只残存一堆废墟。但人民懂得为生存而斗争的意义，在麦收前就通过一切困难，抢修国那里险工，四十道大坝完成三分之一。麦后县领导上更号召全县出动，每日民工多时达两万，大车达五百辆，群众情绪空前高涨。以自动献石来说，即达一万余方（每方四千余斤）群众拆掉鸡棚猪圈，甚至有拆掉住屋献出石头者。先后民力共出到五十万人左右。最值得人感动的，即在大泛期蒋匪控制黄河时，工程队仍利用一切办法，抢救了快出险的堤坝，并出现张朝义、刘振江等抢险的出色英雄。在最艰苦的坚持游击战争与支援前线及执枪分田三大任务中，昆山人民亦有光辉成绩。今年七、八月刘邓和陈粟大军出击河南时，每天支援前线的白面担架与大车等源源不断，在五次大规模支援前线运动中，胜利完成任务。半年来也涌出大批杀敌英雄。此次在七区立功大会上，即有于庆德等廿多人，荣获英雄衔。仅据六月一日至十月底五个月的战果，即毙敌十三名，伤敌四十五名，俘敌八十一名，缴机枪两挺、加拿大冲锋机枪一挺及步枪、短枪、子弹、各种炮弹、战马等。群众得到粮食土地后，不惜一切牺牲流血，不畏惧任何困难，拿起枪来保田保命，用出全力治黄和支前。
