[This article was transmitted from the Ji Lu Yu area by our newspaper on the 21st.] At the military region health department's commendation rally, Comrade Liu Ying, an educational cadre of the Health School, was awarded the title of first-class meritorious worker for creating a model recuperation company. The recuperation company was also presented with a large, seven-foot-long certificate of merit bearing the title "Model Recuperation Company." Comrade Liu Ying, who originally suffered from lung disease, devoted himself wholeheartedly to the task after taking charge of the recuperation company, disregarding his own health. He carefully studied the degree and severity of the soldiers' injuries, adjusted squads and platoons, selected cadres, and promoted the work. He grasped the method of praising the active ones in public and criticizing and enlightening the individual bad ones behind their backs to conduct ideological leadership of the wounded soldiers. In order to solve the wounded soldiers' life problems and make them progress, he especially launched cultural studies, further implemented large-scale mutual assistance in learning, created "finding good news," Q&A sessions, and "point generals," and launched the writing of clapper talks, so that the entire company, after three months of effort, won the honorary title of "Model Recuperation Company" from the Health Department. The recuperation company has become the home and school for the wounded soldiers.

		Regular Life and Learning
    The upsurge of learning and striving for merit has made every soldier buy paper and pens and learn automatically. Each class formulated recuperation plans and living systems, which the wounded soldiers called "class rules," and everyone supervised each other. For example, Dai Jinzhang didn't like to study and learn to read, so Liu Ruiyang asked him to write his unit's rank on the Q&A column, which frightened him into quickly finding Chen Yongwen, the learning group leader, to teach him. After he learned it, he said, "It's really difficult not knowing how to read. I have to study hard. Shandong wounded soldier Liu Xihai (Liu didn't know a single character when he came, but learned more than 500 characters when he was discharged) made such great progress this time, it's even better than school."

		Door Panel Newspaper: Self-Composed and Self-Sung
    The door panel newspaper originally came out every three days; after the large-scale mutual assistance in learning, the door panel newspaper became a daily publication, occupying two large blackboards at a time. Those who could write would write, and those who couldn't would ask others to write for them. Four or five people would contribute one sentence each, regardless of typos, and in a crooked manner, they would make it a roaring success. Every afternoon, the dining area would be packed. The door panel newspaper mainly took the form of clapper talks, and recently it has developed into composing songs. It was first composed by the ninth class of Shandong wounded soldiers, which aroused all classes to compose tunes, such as "Little Cowherd," "Beating the Flower Drum," and "Caulking Jars." The content was all about singing the progress and happiness of the recuperation center. Yin Zixing and two others from the seventh class sang about their squad leader, saying, "The squad leader's leadership method is high, everyone is united as one,..." The ninth class sang, "Comrades in the recuperation company have made great progress, they don't feel bitter about their injuries; those who don't study don't progress, they hold books but don't read...". To those who use being stupid as an excuse not to study, they said, "As long as you put your heart into it, you can learn deeply with patience, and what you learn will take root in your mind, oppose pure gun barrel-ism...". This little tune has a great effect on the entire company's learning and relieving the wounded soldiers' boredom.

		Accumulating Fertilizer to Buy Paper and Seize the Flag
    The tenth class dug its own toilet and sold it for more than two thousand yuan, buying paper and chalk, which made the wounded soldiers very happy. The tenth class wrote a very long clapper talk about this matter from beginning to end and posted it on the blackboard newspaper, which influenced other classes to do the same. In order to more universally improve the learning mood, the company headquarters specially made a "Strive for Learning Model" award flag. After twenty days, an election was held, and the seventh class was selected as the model. Everyone carried the flag to the entrance of the seventh class and shouted "Learn from the seventh class!" Now the learning movement in the entire company is developing rapidly.

		Artistic Construction
    Here it is completely like a school. The walls are coated with evenly applied yellow mud or brick ash crushed by the wounded soldiers themselves, bordered with black edges, and written with eye-catching slogans. On the walls facing the entrance of each class are large portraits of Chairman Mao, and on both sides of the door are beautiful couplets. Entering the courtyard, it is even more colorful, all created by the wounded soldiers.

### 创造模范休养连　刘瑛同志荣获嘉奖

　　创造模范休养连
  　刘瑛同志荣获嘉奖
    【本报冀鲁豫廿一日电】军区卫生部贺功大会上，奖励创造模范休养连的卫生学校教育干事刘瑛同志为一等功臣，并以“模范休养连”七尺长的大奖状，奖给该休养连。按刘瑛同志，原来就有肺病，到休养连负责后，他仍不顾个人身体，苦心钻研，信伤员程度、伤势，调整班排，选择干部，推动工作。掌握对积极的当群众表扬，个别不好的背后批评和启发的方式，进行伤员思想领导，为解决伤员生活的苦愁，使其进步，特发动文化学习，进一步实行学习大互助，创立找好报、问答、点将，发动写快板，使全连经三个月努力，荣获卫生部“模范休养连”的荣誉称号。休养连成了伤员的家庭和学校。
    　　　　正规的生活与学习
    学习立功的热潮，使每个学员都买了纸笔，自动学习。各班制订休养计划和生活制度，伤员自称“班规”，大家互相督促。如戴金章不爱学习识字，刘瑞养叫他在问答栏写出自己连队职别，慌得他赶紧找学习组长陈永文教他，当他学会后说：“不认字真艰难，可得好好学山东伤员刘西海（刘来时一字不识，出院时学会五百多字），想不到在这次有这么大进步，真比学校还好。”
    　　　　门板报上自编自唱
    门板报原来三天一版；学习大互助后，门板报变成一天一版，一次占两块大黑板，会写的写，不会写的叫别人代写，四五个人你一句他一句，不管错白字，歪歪扭扭，就这样搞的轰轰烈烈，一到下午，饭场挤得满满的。门板报主要是通过快板形式进行的，最近又发展到编歌。首先是山东伤号九班编出来的，引起各班都编调子，有小放牛、打花鼓、钉缸等，内容都是唱休养院的进步和快乐。七班尹子幸等三个人，唱他班长说：“班长领导办法高，大家打成心一条，……”九班唱道：“休养连同志大进步呀，身上负伤不觉苦；不学习的不进步呀，手拿书本不肯读……。”对那些借口笨不学习的人说：“脑笨只要你用心呀，耐心经常会学深呀，学在脑海就生根呀，反对单纯枪杆主义呀……。”这个小调，对全连学习和解除伤员苦闷有很大作用。
    　　　　积肥买纸夺旗
    十班自己挖厕所，卖了二千多块钱，买了纸和粉笔，伤员都很高兴。十班把这件事，前前后后写了一个很长的快板，贴到黑板报上，影响别班也这样干起来。为了更普遍提高学习情绪，连部又特制了一块“争取学习模范”的奖旗，二十天后，进行选举，选了七班为模范，大家抬着旗送到七班门口，并高喊着“向七班看齐！”现全连学习运动正飞速的发展。
    　　　　艺术的建设
    这里完全象学校，墙壁上涂着均匀的黄泥，或伤员们亲手压碎的砖灰，镶着黑边，写着醒目的标语。各班门口迎面墙上都画着毛主席的大像，门两旁是漂亮的对联，进来院，更是五光十色，这都是伤员们的创造。
