　　Jingxing Yuci and More Than Ten Counties and Cities
　　Young and Middle-Aged People Enlist Voluntarily One After Another
　　[Report from this newspaper] In our region, Anze, Linzhang, Zanhuang, Yuci, Linxian, Yuanshi, Jingxing, Neiqiu, Cixian, Wu'an, Huguan, Changzhi, Changshi, Xiangyuan, Xiyang, Licheng, Lucheng, Pingshun, Shouyang and other counties and cities have set off an upsurge in joining the army. In the Jingxing Fourth District, which has been liberated for half a year, at a rally of ten thousand people celebrating the great counter-offensive, 1,082 people signed up on the spot to join the army. After a current affairs discussion meeting of more than 1,200 people in the fifth and sixth districts of Anze, more than 520 people signed up within four hours. After 440 young adults from the third and seventh districts signed up to join the army, 204 women signed up to join the women's militia. Many cadres and party members actively signed up, playing a positive leading role. After Comrade Shufang, secretary of the Neiqiu Second District, Deputy District Chief Hao, and Secretary Cheng Shiying took the lead in signing up, 100 village cadres signed up, wanting to go to the front line with them. In the fifth and sixth districts, under the call of District Chief Wang and District Chief Chen's registration, 453 male and female village cadres all rushed to sign up. After the first district party committee and District Chief Hao signed up, 163 party member cadres signed up to dig up the old roots [eliminate feudal influences]. Two old men in their forties and fifties on East Street wanted to catch old Chiang [Chiang Kai-shek]. Fearing that everyone would think they were too old, they secretly shaved their beards and signed up. When others pointed it out to them, one old man said, "I'm only thirty-eight!" One said, "I'm not even forty. If I can't carry a gun, I can be a cook, I'm good at that." All localities also used the mass line to strictly examine their soldiers. The masses at the Gucheng basic point in the second district of Cixian examined the soldiers and said, "We need good men to join the army and go to the front line. We must pick out the chaff and husks as early as possible." Fang Baoshan of Siqian Street in the first district was an object of struggle. As soon as he signed up, the masses said, "Can he still do things for us? Get out of here!" Liu Zhijun was a minor object of struggle and was also squeezed out by the masses. The masses said, "With so many people watching, bad people can't even join the army." Zhao Xiaohai of Dayi Town in the fifth district of Changzhi said, "If landlords and special agents join the army, they won't be able to dig up the bad roots for us, they will only make things worse!" In order to escape struggle, landlord Suo Zhu'er signed up three times in a row, but the masses didn't want him, and also screened out Jiang Geji, who had signed up. After strict examination, the new soldiers' consciousness has been further improved. For example, Liu Tianxuan, a new soldier from Beijie, Huguan, said, "I am joining the army to capture Chiang Kai-shek alive, and I am determined to see it through to the end." After reviewing their history and pouring out grievances, new soldiers in the third district said, "We are determined to do it, this is our own business, if we don't go, who will?" Some said, "I am determined to go to the battlefield and capture Chiang alive to make a great contribution."
