    Ji Xing Taihang First Branch Inspects Loans
    Organizes the Masses to Produce to Overcome Famine
    [Our Newspaper] Ji'nan Bank Taihang First Branch, recently inspected loans and studied the credit work in production to overcome famine, and put forward the following issues: 1. The characteristic of rural credit work is "labor power becomes capital." In famine years, there is a lot of labor power. Organize funds in conjunction with labor power to develop various winter sideline production activities, find a way out for labor power, and solve the difficulty of "too much labor power and lack of funds." The credit department must support small-scale cooperatives of labor-capital mutual assistance, organize the masses to turn surplus materials and dead objects into liquid cash to serve production and overcome famine. In addition, it can also develop "deposit in kind, loan in kind" business (deposit grain, cotton, substitute food, and other production and famine relief materials) to achieve mutual assistance, mutual relief, and grain regulation during famine relief. 2. Conduct a general inspection of credit business to make funds fully serve the poor and hired peasants. From the inspection of the Yangjiazhai Credit Department in Yuanshi, the poor and hired peasant line in the loan has not been implemented. Loan statistics for all classes from May to July: New middle peasants accounted for 40 percent of the number of loans, accounting for 41.67 percent of the loan amount. Old middle peasants accounted for 53 percent of the number of loans, accounting for 49.16 percent of the loan amount. Households whose "tails" had been cut off accounted for 5.5 percent of the number of loans, accounting for 8.5 percent of the loan amount. Landlords who had been struggled against accounted for 7.5 percent of the number of loans, accounting for 58 percent of the loan amount. Obviously, the most loans were given to old middle peasants, and even to households who had been struggled against, and the care for the poor and hired peasants was not enough. 3. Loan inspection and re-lending. We must inspect the class line in our loans. In the past, loan inspection only paid attention to the purpose, but not enough attention was paid to who it served. This time, loan inspection should start from the composition of the loan to see its role, and carry out adjustments between households and households, villages and villages, and regions and regions, so that loans can be used in areas with severe disasters. In the adjustment within a village, loans must be truly used for production and famine relief for the poor and hired peasants to solve their difficulties. The re-lending is managed through democratic discussion by the masses. Combined with loan inspection and re-lending, a new loan is issued, allocated to Jingxing 25 million yuan (the disaster is the most serious, with a harvest of 15 percent). Lincheng 10 million yuan, Shahe 10 million yuan, Huolu 3.74 million yuan, and Neiqiu 3.26 million yuan. New loans must completely serve the poor and hired peasants, and solve their funding difficulties in organizing tools, raw materials, and sales in production and famine relief. For the clearing of loans that are due, if they cannot be repaid due to the disaster, the repayment can be postponed.

    冀行太行一分行检查贷款
    组织群众生产渡荒
    【本报讯】冀南银行太行一分行，日前检查贷款，研究生产渡荒中的信用工作，提出如下问题：一、农村信用工作的特点，就是“劳力变资本”，荒年劳力多，组织资金结合劳力，发展冬季各种副业生产活动，给劳力找出路，解决“劳力多、资金缺”的困难，信用部必须扶持劳资互助的小型社，组织群众剩余物资、死物变活钱服务于生产渡荒。另外还可发展“存实贷实”业务（存粮食、棉花、代食品等生产渡荒物资），以达到渡荒中互助、互济、粮食调剂。二、普遍检查信用业务，使资金全力服务贫雇。从元氏杨家寨信用部来检查，贷款中的贫雇路线还没贯彻。五月至七月各阶层贷款统计：新中农占贷款数百分之四十。占贷款数百分之四一·六七。旧中农占贷款数百分之五十三，占贷款数百分之四九·一六，贷给割尾巴户占户数百分之五·五，占贷款数百分之八·五，贷给被斗过的地主占户数百分之七·五，占贷款数百分之五八。很明显贷款最多的还是旧中农，甚至贷给了被斗户，对贫雇照顾是不够的。三、查贷与转贷。检查我们贷款中的阶级路线，过去查贷只注意用途，但为谁服务，则注意不够。这次查贷，要从贷款的成份中看起的作用，进行户与户，村与村，地区与地区的调整，使贷款用到灾荒重的区，一村内的调整，贷款要真正用到贫雇生产渡荒上去，解决他们的困难。转贷经群众民主讨论掌握，结合查贷转贷发放一部新贷，分配为井陉二千五百万元（灾荒是最严重的，收成一成半）。临城一千万元，沙河一千万元，获鹿三百七十四万元，内邱三百二十六万元。新贷必须完全服务于贫雇，解决他们在生产渡荒中的组织工具、原料及运销中的资金困难。到期贷款的清理，如因灾荒不能归还可延期归还。
