Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 13th -- The Democratic Allied Forces' rear echelon corps, with the firm will of "not fearing the cold north wind, not fearing sweating profusely, and striving to become iron men through a hundred days of hard training," have thrown themselves into an intense winter large-scale military training movement. After mobilization, the leaders of a certain regiment of the Nenjiang Military Region rose early every morning to drill, and the soldiers spent the whole day on the drill ground jumping high, jumping far, vaulting over wooden horses, traversing obstacles, throwing hand grenades, and aiming. After self-criticism, the cadres unanimously agreed that training soldiers meant training cadres and training themselves, and they all formulated plans. Deputy platoon leader Ding Huaiyi was determined to participate in all activities of the platoon. Company commander Han Xilin guaranteed that he would not miss the target in three shots and would pass through all obstacles in full gear. The director of the regiment's political department also proposed that, in addition to completing his own work, he would guarantee to learn how to use mortars and heavy machine guns. Under this influence, the soldiers spontaneously formulated plans. Li Zhongsheng, a messenger in the political department, though disabled in his right hand during the Zhengjiatun battle, still challenged others, throwing grenades with his left hand. Cao Wanfu, a soldier in a certain regiment of the Songjiang Military Region, said during the training mobilization: "Don't be lazy in training, and whoever doesn't study hard doesn't want to defend the land they have been allocated." His words became a call to action. Cook Liu Chunlin also made up his mind and said: "I also want to learn to throw grenades, so that I can directly eliminate the enemy when I go to the front." The Hejiang Military Region has organized working groups to go deep into various companies to practically help and promote training, and has allocated 4 million yuan as training funds. After autumn training, a certain unit in Heilongjiang Province has universally improved its military skills, and the "seize the red flag" movement launched in the past month has achieved remarkable results. In the grenade throwing competition, the fourth squad, fearing that the red flag would be moved, trained hard day and night, with the whole squad averaging 35.6 meters. Dou Yongqing, the deputy squad leader of the second squad of the first platoon of the first battalion of a certain regiment, only hit 11 meters at the beginning, but after five days of hard training, he leaped to 42 meters. The youth vanguard team of the second company of a certain regiment of the Mudanjiang Military Region established voluntary martial arts training groups in units of squads or platoons, competing and exchanging experiences at any time, and training has become a mass upsurge.

　　不怕北风寒苦练百日成铁汉
  　东北后方兵团大练兵
    【新华社东北十三日电】民主联军后方各兵团在“不怕北风寒，不怕水淌流大汗，苦练百日成铁汉”的坚强意志下，投入紧张的冬季大练兵运动。嫩江军区某团经过动员后，每晨团首长以下都起来上操，战士们整天在操场上跳高，跳远，跨木马，越障碍，掷手榴弹，瞄三角。干部经过检讨，一致认为练兵就是练干部，练自己，均纷纷订计划。副排长丁怀义决心参加班里一切活动。连长韩西林保证三枪不脱靶，并全副武装通过大障碍。团政治处主任亦提出除完成自己工作外，保证学会使用迫击炮和重机枪。在此影响下，战士纷纷自动订计划。政治处收发员李忠盛虽在郑家屯战斗中右手负伤残废，仍向别人挑战，用左手投弹。松江军区某团战士曹万福在练兵动员时说：“在练兵中不偷懒，谁不用心学习，谁就不想保卫自己分得的土地”，他的话成了行动的号召。炊事员刘春林也下了决心说：“我也要学会投弹，到前方时可直接消灭敌人。”合江军区已组织工作组，深入各连队，实际帮助与推动练兵，并拨款四百万元作为练兵资金。黑龙江某部经秋季练兵，军事技术普遍提高，一月来掀起的“夺红旗”运动，成绩卓著，在投弹比赛中，四班怕红旗搬家，日夜苦练，全班平均达三五点六米。某团一营一排二班副窦永清开始时只打十一米，经过五天苦练后，即飞跃进步到四十二米。牡丹江军区某团二连青先队以班或排为单位，建立志愿结合的练武小组，随时比赛，交流经验，练兵已成为群众性的热潮。
