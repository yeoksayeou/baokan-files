　　Jin-Sui Administrative Office Issues Instructions on Winter Production
  　Solving Difficulties in Transportation for Poor and Hired Peasants
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 18th] The Jin-Sui Administrative Office, based on the characteristics of the region, instructed governments at all levels that this winter's production should focus on vigorously organizing transportation and developing textiles. It encourages poor and hired peasants to invest the fruits of their struggle in production to solve the difficulties of food and production in the coming spring. Local governments, in order to help poor and hired peasants develop transportation production in a more planned way, have sent cadres deep into the villages to provide concrete assistance. In the second district, villages along the road from Shenchi to Wuzhai, which is more than 100 miles long, have organized more than 240 double-ox cart transportation teams from November 1st to 11th. The teams are led by responsible persons selected on a natural village basis, traveling between Shenchi, Shuoxian, Daixian, and Xingxian to transport grain and goods. In the mountainous areas of Hequ, Baode, and Pianguan counties, where there are no large carts, livestock transportation has been organized. He, Bao, and other counties are also developing Yellow River shipping, organizing village transportation teams, and the trading company is providing loans to solve the difficulties in the initial stage. In the upsurge of winter production, many poor and hired peasants want to participate in transportation but lack large carts and livestock. It has now been decided to quickly distribute large carts and livestock, or to extract some of the fruits of the struggle to help poor peasants buy livestock and vehicles jointly. In villages where land reform is underway, labor exchange and mutual assistance will be used to take turns participating in transportation, so that neither is delayed.

　　晋绥行署指示冬季生产
  　解决贫雇运输困难
    【新华社晋绥十八日电】晋绥行署根据本区特点指示各级政府，今冬生产以大力组织运输和发展纺织为主，鼓励贫雇农以分获的斗争果实投入生产，解决明春口粮和生产困难。地方政府为更有计划的帮助贫雇农发展运输生产，已派出干部深入乡村具体帮助。二分区由神池到五寨长达百余里大道两旁的村庄，从十一月一日到十一日已组织起双牛大车二百四十余辆的大运输队，以自然村为单位选出负责人带领，来往于神池、朔县、代县、兴县间，运输粮食货物。河曲、保德、偏关三县山地没有大车，已组织牲畜运输。河、保等县并发展黄河船运，组织各村运输队，并由贸易公司贷款解决初创中的困难。在冬季生产热潮中，许多贫雇想要参加运输而缺少大车和牲畜，现已决定将大车和牲畜迅速分配，或抽出部分斗争果实帮助贫苦农民合伙购买牲口车辆，对正在进行土改村庄，则以变工互助轮流参加运输，做到两不耽误。
