Xinhua News Agency, East China, 16th: As the autumn winds rise and heavy frosts descend, the logistical clothing workers and the broad masses of women here have been rushing to make winter clothes for the counter-offensive army at the front. They completed all the work five days ago and sent the clothes to the front. At the end of September, as soon as the anti-"mopping-up" campaign in the ×× Sub-district came to an end, the clothing factories in the area started operating intensively. Workers such as Wu Gongfu of the dyeing factory crossed mountains and ridges to bring back the buried large pots and adopted the method of "never letting the pot idle while eating," increasing the number of dyed cloths from 15 pots to 25 pots per day. The fifth and sixth teams of the fourth branch of the Military Supply General Factory changed from cold water dyeing to hot water dyeing, increasing the number of dyed cloths from 20 pots to 40 pots per day, greatly improving production efficiency. The workers started work earlier every day and continued to work for three hours into the night. In the sewing factories, each machine increased from 17 sets to 25 sets per day while maintaining a density of 18 stitches per inch. Although the workers in the cutting factories had blisters on their hands and cracks in their finger joints, they were unwilling to rest even for a moment. The 49-year-old worker Li Aju cut 70 sets of clothes a day, exceeding the quota by one-half of the prescribed 45 sets. Feng Junting stayed up for three nights and made 150 pieces. Yang Fengming worked while ill, ironing cloth bags at the table, increasing production from 200 pieces to 400 pieces. On average, the number of pieces produced by each machine per day increased from 40 pieces to 60 pieces. The broad masses of women were universally involved in the sewing craze. In the villages of Laopo and Liugou townships in Bin-Hai South County alone, women sewed 3,400 sets in three days. Women in the Ping Shang, Jiao Shan, and Zhuang Gang districts sewed more than 23,000 pieces. Women in Zhaohua County, Bohai, completed more than 600 sets. The female members of the Youth League in Huimin Sugar Market Street went to the hills to harvest crops during the day and stayed up all night making cotton-padded clothes. The transportation departments waited in each village with vehicles and livestock, and transported the clothes as soon as they were made. During transportation, when it rained, the transportation team members covered the military uniforms with their own quilts and clothes. The ×× Clothing Factory, located far away, completed ××10,000 sets and sent them to the front in early October.
