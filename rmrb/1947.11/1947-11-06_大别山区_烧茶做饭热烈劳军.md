    Dabie Mountain Area
    Boiling Water, Cooking Meals, Enthusiastically Supporting the Army
    [Xinhua News Agency, Eyuwan, 4th] The news of our army's complete annihilation of the enemy's 40th Division and 82nd Brigade quickly spread throughout the Dabie Mountain area, and the masses in various places were ecstatic upon hearing the news. In Zhao Jiawan Village, Guangji, on the second day after the battle ended, despite the rain, more than a hundred farmers braved the muddy roads and traveled dozens of miles to voluntarily transport the wounded for our army. When a unit of our army camped in a village after the battle, the residents of the village immediately took seventy large fish from the pond to support the army. The next day, when the unit moved, the masses set off firecrackers to see them off. Some liberated farmers in a village collectively donated twenty bolts of cloth to support the army. When another unit of our army returned to the village where they were originally stationed after the battle, the residents of the village welcomed them in groups, congratulated the troops in unison, and rushed to boil water, cook dishes, and prepare meals for the soldiers in every household. An elderly woman surnamed Wu, over sixty years old, busied herself for half the night upon seeing the troops return, as affectionate as if she were receiving long-lost children.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Eyuwan Front, 4th] When the Liberation Army was fighting in Zhongpu near Shangcheng, it was the local farmers' autumn harvest season. In order to conserve manpower, the various directly subordinate units of the Liberation Army organized their own stretchers to transport the wounded, drawing a total of 118 cadres, communication personnel, and service personnel, as well as 30 livestock. They transported 45 lightly and seriously wounded soldiers in one day. Everyone was extremely concerned about and took care of the wounded soldiers. A civil servant, Wang Jinfu, took off his own shoes and gave them to a wounded soldier to urinate in while carrying the stretcher. The wounded soldier said with emotion, "You put down your work to carry the stretcher and care for us so much. When my injuries heal, I will go to the front line, and in the next battle, I will be sure to better complete my mission!" The old folks harvesting in the fields said, "The Central Army drafts men and seizes laborers, but the Eighth Route Army cherishes the people, and even the officials come to carry stretchers."

    大别山区
    烧茶做饭热烈劳军
    【新华社鄂豫皖四日电】我军全歼敌四十师及八十二旅之胜利捷报，迅速传遍大别山区，各地群众闻讯若狂。广济赵家湾村，在战斗结束之第二日，虽逢天雨，仍有百余农民踏着泞泥道路行数十里自动来为我军转运伤员。我军某部于战斗结束后在某村宿营，该村居民即从池塘里提出七十条大鱼来劳军。次日该部移防时，群众鸣鞭炮相送。某村翻身农民集体捐了二十匹布劳军。我军另一部于战后返回原驻防某村时，该村居民结队欢迎，同声向部队祝贺，家家急忙为战士烧茶烧菜做饭。一姓吴的六十多岁老太太，见部队回来，忙了半夜，亲热得象接待久别重逢的子弟一样。
    【新华社鄂豫皖前线四日电】解放军在商城附近中铺作战时，正值当地农民秋收，解放军某部各直属队，为节约民力，纷纷自己组织担架，转运伤员，共计抽出干部通讯员勤务员等百一十八人。及牲口三十匹，一天内转运轻重伤员四十五人。大家对负伤战士极为关心照顾，公务员王金福在抬担架时，脱下自己的鞋子给伤员接小便，伤员感动的说：“你们放下工作来抬担架，对我们这样关心，我伤养好了就上前线，下次战斗一定要更好的完成任务！”在田里收割的老百姓则说：“中央军抽丁抓夫，八路军爱惜百姓当官的都来抬担架。”
