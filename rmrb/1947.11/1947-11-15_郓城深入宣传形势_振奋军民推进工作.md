(This report from the Ji-Lu-Yu [Hebei-Shandong-Henan] area, 12th) After Yuncheng extensively and deeply publicized the great counter-offensive, the masses' confidence in victory has been strengthened, and most village organizations have now been restored. Since our army entered the stage of the great counter-offensive in September, Yuncheng has seized the opportunity during guerrilla warfare to intensify propaganda on the great counter-offensive, inspiring the military and civilians to actively launch struggles against the enemy. In addition to the county government's organs holding mass meetings near the villages, more than 400 villages spontaneously held mass meetings, with more than 75,000 people attending; seven celebration meetings were held at the district level, with more than 26,000 people attending; and the county held one memorial and public trial meeting, with 4,000 people attending. In the entire county, 449 villages have written slogans for the counter-offensive. After our repeated propaganda, the masses' ideological mood has changed from panic to stability, and poor peasants who were unwilling to take land have become aware and voluntarily asked the district for land. Through this work, most villages have restored various internal organizations, and the broad masses are celebrating the great counter-offensive with joy. The following are a few experiences from the 20 days of propaganda: First, propaganda work is an indispensable part of the central work, and it is necessary to thoroughly come from the masses, deeply explore the positive thinking of the masses, and understand the ideological concerns of the masses and the objective and subjective reasons for these concerns. Then, combine this with the current situation and use the positive thinking of the masses to overcome negative thinking. Second, propaganda and education can only achieve greater results when carried out in practical action. Only by starting from the urgent demands and vital interests of the masses can the masses be quickly mobilized. Third, all our propaganda must be completely truthful. In this great counter-offensive propaganda, individual untruthful propaganda was resolutely opposed. What we talked about was completely true facts, or things that can definitely be achieved, so the masses can fully accept and trust our propaganda and education. Fourth, propaganda methods should be as diverse, fresh, and lively as possible, organizing all forces, all departments, and all cadres to participate, such as publishing news bulletins, blackboard newspapers, and loudspeakers.

　　郓城深入宣传形势
    振奋军民推进工作
    【本报冀鲁豫十二日电】郓城普遍深入大反攻宣传后，群众胜利信心加强，现各村组织大部恢复。自九月我军进入大反攻阶段时，郓城在游击战争中抓紧大反攻宣传，使军民振奋，积极的展开对敌斗争。除县府各机关召开驻村附近群众大会外，有四百多村自动开了群众大会，到会人数达七万五千多人；以区为单位召开的庆祝会七个，到会二万六千多人；以县召开追悼公审大会一次，到会四千人，全县有四百四十九村，都写上反攻标语。经过我们反复宣传后，群众的思想情绪已由慌乱到安定，不愿要地的贫农已有了觉悟，自动找到区里要土地。并通过这一工作，绝大部分村庄，恢复了村内各种组织，广大群众则欢天喜地的庆祝大反攻。廿天宣传中，有以下几点体验：一、宣传工作是中心工作不可缺少的一部分，必须很好的从群众中来，深入的发掘群众的积极思想，并了解群众的思想顾虑和产生这些顾虑的客观、主观原因，然后以此和当前时局结合，以群众的积极思想克服消极思想。二、只有在实际行动中，进行宣传教育，才能发扬更大效果，只有从群众的迫切要求和切身利益启发，才能使群众迅速行动起来。三、我们的一切宣传必须完全真实，在这次大反攻宣传中，坚决反对了个别不真实的宣传，我们谈的完全是真实的事实，或者是一定可以实现的东西，所以群众对我们的宣传教育，都能完全接受和信任。四、宣传方式尽量多种多样，新鲜活泼，组织各力量、各个部门，全体干部参加。如出捷报、黑板报、喇叭筒等。
