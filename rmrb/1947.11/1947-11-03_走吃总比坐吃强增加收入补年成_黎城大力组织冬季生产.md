    "Better to Earn While Moving Than Sitting Idle: Increase Income to Make Up for Bad Harvests"
    Licheng Vigorously Organizes Winter Production
    [This Dispatch from Licheng] The entire county suffered from a poor harvest due to spring drought and autumn frost, resulting in a severe famine. Therefore, the broad masses are generally eager to seize winter production to make up for the bad harvest and overthrow Chiang Kai-shek immediately after the autumn harvest. Beiliu organized poor and hired peasant model households to calculate the year's harvest. Zhang Lisheng's family of three cultivated thirteen mu of land, but only harvested thirty jin of cotton (from five mu), one da shi of grain (from four mu), seven da dou of corn (from two mu), and four da dou of sorghum (from two mu) this autumn. This made the poor and hired laborers break their complacency and fully recognize the famine. After discussing "How to Increase Production to Fill the Gaps" in the poor and hired peasant association, everyone unanimously clarified that to survive the famine, they must pay attention to small amounts of money and engage in production diligently. "It's better to move and eat than sit idly!" Zhang Haitang, the branch secretary of Duanjia Village, even more forcefully put forward the mobilization slogan: "Don't be afraid of earning little, only be afraid of not eating. Men engage in transportation, women engage in textile production, earning enough for one day's food each day, making up for the gaps, achieving 'cultivating three and having one surplus,' and supporting the front line to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek!" Within three days, Beiliu organized a transportation team of one hundred and ninety-three people and animals, thirteen small-scale cooperatives, and invested 1,330,000 yuan, 1,730 jin of dates, 760 jin of peanuts, and three shi and nine dou of refined grain as capital into winter production. The Second District alone formed one hundred and seventy-seven small-scale cooperatives and began production. The masses have full enthusiasm for production, but they suffer from a lack of transportation and small profits. The cloth they weave cannot be sold, and they lack cotton. Therefore, the Beiliu base point formed a central cooperative to uniformly guide the winter production of the entire base point in a planned, organized, and led manner. To smoothly develop transportation and textile production, and to sell local products to exchange for grain and cotton, three hospitality stores with complete rice and noodles were opened in Weizi Town, the South Gate of this county, and Henan Shop to conveniently solve the problem of food and lodging and also be responsible for selling local products. The approach is: the cooperatives in each village collect local cloth and hand it over to the South Gate depot through the central cooperative for sale. They transport walnuts and dates from each village to Weizi Town, sell them to buy back grain, transport it to Henan Shop for processing, and then bring back necessities such as salt and cotton through the South Gate depot for sale, combining transportation and trade. The County and District Expanded Cadre Meeting of this county gathered the initial experiences of carrying out winter production, and after detailed research, everyone unanimously agreed that increasing production to overcome the famine and economic difficulties, and powerfully supporting the victory of the great counter-offensive, requires mobilizing and organizing the broad masses' labor, livestock, and funds. It must be planned, organized, and led, and based on specific favorable conditions, to carry out a large-scale cooperative production movement focusing on textile production and transportation, combined with handicraft small-scale cooperatives. For this purpose, it is also necessary: 1. To overcome the difficulties and blindness of the masses in winter production, it is necessary to strengthen organizational leadership, open the door, and develop outwards. On the basis of the grassroots organization of production planned, organized, and led by the central cooperative, cooperatives at all levels should organize specialized personnel to be responsible for establishing connections with markets and production units in various places to exchange economic information, organize mutual exchange of goods, smoothly buy and sell according to the needs of the peasants, and organically combine the market and the countryside to develop transportation and trade, helping peasants sell local products and exchange them for necessities such as grain, cotton, and salt. 2. The leadership must implement the viewpoint and class line of the poor and hired peasants. The mobilization and organization of winter production should be based on the poor and hired peasants as the backbone to unite the broad masses to actively participate. The determination of the cooperative dividend policy should also be based on the viewpoint of the poor and hired class. (Joint Office Yang Ke)
    [This Dispatch from Southern Hebei on the 31st] Yuanchao Yang Village Community summarized the combination of agricultural and sideline occupations, earning three million yuan. The community began winter production. The entire community has ten oil presses, ten rolling mills, thirteen cotton gins, nine flour mills, fourteen tofu workshops, fifteen bone workshops, and eight lumber yards. According to the statistics of ten villages from last year to now, there are a total of thirty-eight groups, two hundred and twenty-seven households, two hundred and thirty-five male full laborers, sixty-six semi-laborers, and forty-eight people engaged in sideline occupations. After eight months, they gained a profit of 3,244,260 yuan (including 558,700 yuan earned from individual operations). For example, Wang Ruyi of Huazhuang Village participated in oil pressing after the wheat harvest, obtaining 1,300 jin of rapeseed cake. After using 50 jin of cake per mu of corn, there was still 600 jin left, which was applied to the wheat field. Huang Yongsheng is a militia captain. After participating in oil pressing, he obtained over 1,000 jin of cake and bought a sow. This year, the village's sideline occupations earned a profit of 950,000 yuan, which was all used to buy cake fertilizer. Sideline occupations greatly supported agriculture. Now, each village is carrying out winter sideline production.

    黎城大力组织冬季生产
    【本报黎城讯】全县由于春旱、秋霜。普遍歉收，造成严重灾荒，因此广大群众普遍积极要求收耕完结立即抓住冬季生产补年成，刨老蒋。北流组织贫雇典型户算年成，张礼生全家三口人，种十三亩地，今秋仅收三十斤棉花（五亩），一大石谷（四亩），七大斗玉茭（二亩），四大斗高粱（二亩）。由此贫雇层打破麻痹自满，充分认识了灾荒，又通过贫雇会讨论：“怎样增产补窟窿”后，大家一致明确了要想渡过荒，就得看起小钱，好好闹生产，“跑一跑饱一饱，走吃总比坐吃强！”段家庄支书张海堂同志，更有力的提出动员口号：“不怕咱打少，只怕咱不吃，男人搞运输，女人搞纺织，一天赚下够一天吃，补起窟窿来，达到耕三余一，支援前线刨倒蒋介石！”北流三天内组织起包括人畜百九十三个的运输队，十三个小型合作社，百三十三万元钱，千七百三十斤枣，七百六十斤花生，三石九斗细粮为资金，投入冬季生产。仅二区即组成百七十七个小型合作社，开始生产。群众生产热情十足，但苦于运输无门，且利润太小，织出布来卖不出去，又缺乏棉花，为此北流基点组成一个中心合作社，有计划有组织有领导的统一指导全基点冬季生产，为了顺利发展运输纺织，推销土产换回粮食棉花，在微子镇、本县南关、河南店开了三个米面俱全的留人起火店，便宜解决食宿问题，又负责推销土产品。做法是：由各村合作社收起土布，通过中心合作社，交南关货栈去卖，从各村驮上核桃、枣到微子镇，卖掉买回粮食，运到河南店罗了，再捎回食盐、棉花等必须品，通过南关货栈去卖，使运输与贸易相结合起来。本县县区扩大干部会，集中了以上开展冬季生产的初步点滴经验，经过详细研究，大家一致认为增产渡荒克服经济困难，有力支援大反攻胜利，必须发动与组织广大群众劳畜力与资金，有计划有组织有领导，根据具体有利条件，开展一个以纺织运输为主，结合手工业小型合作社大规模的合作生产运动，为此还必须：一、为了克服群众冬季生产中的困难与盲目性，必须强化组织领导，打开大门，向外发展，在中心合作社有计划有组织有领导的生产的基层组织基础上，各级合作社并组织专门人才负责，与各地各路市场、生产单位取得连系，互通经济情报，组织互通有无，根据农民需要，顺利买回卖出，并使市场与农村有机结合起来，发展运输与贸易，帮助农民推销土产，换回粮食、棉花、食盐等必须品。二、领导上必须贯澈贫雇阶级观点与阶级路线，冬季生产的发动组织，应以贫雇为骨干来团结广大群众积极参加，合作分红政策的确定，亦应以贫雇阶级观点为出发点。（联合办公室杨柯）
