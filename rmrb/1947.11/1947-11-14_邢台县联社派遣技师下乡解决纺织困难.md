　　Xingtai County Cooperative Sends Technicians to Villages to Solve Textile Difficulties
    [Reported from this newspaper in Xingtai] The textile movement in the old liberated areas has been widely carried out. Villages have purchased many ginning machines and cotton carding bows. However, due to the unfamiliarity of the masses with the technology, most villages do not know how to use them. In some villages, the machines constantly malfunction, and the cotton cannot be carded, which worries the masses greatly. According to the demands of the masses, the County Cooperative specifically dispatched two technical comrades, Ma Rensheng and Yao Tangxiao, to go to the countryside to repair the machines day and night. Comrade Ma Rensheng devoted himself to researching and improving the tools. In Xizhuang Village, after transforming the manual bow (which cards more than 100 catties per day) into a water-powered bow, production increased ninefold, carding 1,000 catties per day. In Songjiazhuang, after improving the animal-powered bow, the daily output increased from 200 catties to 600 catties, an increase of two times. The cotton carding machine's output increased from 60 catties per day to 200 catties. The masses in each village are scrambling to find Old Ma and call for Old Ma, and the masses are clamoring that "there are too few Old Mas". In order to promote the technology, a short-term training class for cotton carding and ginning workers was held in the Ninth District Cooperative to exchange experiences and promote technology.

　　邢台县联社派遣技师下乡解决纺织困难
    【本报邢台讯】老区纺织运动，已普遍开展，各村购买不少轧机风弓，因群众技术不熟练，大部村不会使用，有的村机子不断出毛病，有花弹轧不出来，群众很着急。县联社根据群众要求，特派马仁生、姚堂小两个技术同志下乡日夜奔忙收拾机子。马仁生同志尽心研究改良工具，在西庄村把人力弓（日轧百余斤）改造为水力弓后，增产九倍，日轧一千斤。在宋家庄把畜力弓改良后，由日轧二百斤达到六百斤，增产两倍。弹机由一天弹六十斤，增产到二百斤。各村的群众都争抢着找老马、叫老马，群众吵嚷“老马太少了”。为推广技术，在九区社召开了短期弹轧花工人训练班，进行了交流经验，推广技术。（张青、乔永广、王从周）
