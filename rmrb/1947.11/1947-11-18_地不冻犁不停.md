　　The ground doesn't freeze, the plows don't stop
  　Deep Investigation in Qin Yuan Reveals Guo Dao Has Not Moved
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 15th] After thorough investigation in Qin Yuan, it was discovered that there are still villages that have not carried out autumn plowing at all, Guo Dao Town being one of them. On the 24th of last month, the district convened a meeting of village cadres. During the exchange of autumn plowing experiences, it was discovered that Guo Dao cadres couldn't talk about any experiences, as they hadn't led the masses in autumn plowing at all. After this inspection, the village was re-mobilized, and discussions were held on how to organize autumn plowing. Some said at the meeting: "There is a lot of land and few livestock, so we can't plow it all," but others said: "There are idle oxen in the herd." Afterwards, the cadres and group leaders of each mutual aid team conducted in-depth autumn plowing education in the mutual aid teams, using the comparison between autumn plowing and spring plowing to illustrate the importance of autumn plowing, and correct the idea of valuing commerce over agriculture. Then, each group reorganized mutual aid, implementing voluntary combination, and on the 30th, the entire village organized 54 head of livestock to go to the land. Those who did not have livestock automatically borrowed livestock from outside to plow the land. By the 7th of this month, only one-third of the village's more than 3,700 mu of autumn land had been plowed. Therefore, all organizations and groups in the town, as well as public and private businesses, squeezed out 73 head of livestock and organized manpower to help military dependents, revolutionary martyrs, and participating civilian laborers in the whole town to dig the land. The whole village also extracted more than 30 people to dig the land. Now the whole village has put forward the slogan: "The ground doesn't freeze, the plows don't stop, people don't rest," striving to complete all the plowing within 16 days.
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 15th] Since the end of the military service work in the second district of Tunliu, the leadership has promptly and deeply mobilized autumn plowing, overcoming the "take a break" mentality. Twelve villages including Lu Village, Xu Village, and Yuan Village, have recognized the importance of autumn plowing through comparison and calculation. Lao Jun Zhuang calculated that if the whole village did not plow the autumn land, it would reduce the yield by 400 dan (approx. 40,000 kg), which greatly moved the masses. The leadership also promptly put forward the slogan: "Earn public grain at the plow," so the masses reflected: "Whether you calculate or not, there is a big difference. We didn't take this seriously before." Wang Village decided that livestock would not be used for transportation, women would not visit their parents' homes, and they would not attend meetings or watch plays. The masses in Lu Village even swore: "We will not stop until the land is plowed," so men and women throughout the district threw themselves into the tense autumn plowing wave. According to statistics from only twelve villages including Lu Village, from the 4th to the 8th, under the concentrated efforts of more than 2,000 people and 500 head of livestock, 16,000 mu have been plowed, accounting for four-tenths of all autumn land.
　　People in the fourth and fifth districts of Qin County pull plows to plow the land
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 15th] The fourth and fifth districts of Qin County overcame the difficulty of lacking animal power and organized a large number of people to pull plows to plow the land. Due to the crazy looting by the Yan clique over the years, the two districts have a very severe lack of animal power. After the Fourth District's Kai Village created the method of people pulling plows, the district office organized 153 village cadres from various villages to visit the village on the 3rd of this month. Since then, the villages have universally organized people to pull plows. According to incomplete statistics, there are already 194 people pulling plows, men and women, averaging 582 mu of land plowed per day. In the Fifth District, Dong Zhongtang, the village chief of Baogang Jiaocun Village, and Li Liangwen, the director of the Armed Forces Committee, took the lead, organizing 35 men and women to pull plows to plow the land, plowing 42 mu of land in two days. Then, Tian Shupan, a model teacher from Sha Tuo Village, and Wang Yuexian, a woman, also led students and women to organize two people-pulled plows. By the 11th, they had finished plowing all the autumn land in the village. In addition, Yan Dejun, the village chief of Yang Zhuang Village, organized 157 people and 64 children to pull plows to plow the land, influencing villages such as Tao Liang and Yuan Wang, who also organized people to pull plows. The district office also called on them to learn from them, guaranteeing that the autumn land would be universally plowed once.

　　地不冻犁不停
  　沁源深入检查发现郭道没动
    【本报太岳十五日电】沁源经深入检查后，发现还有根本没有进行秋垡的村子，郭道镇即是其中之一。上月二十四日，区上召开各村干部会议。交流秋垡经验中，发现郭道干部谈不出经验来，原来根本没有领导群众进行秋垡。经这次检查后，该村又重新动员，讨论如何组织秋垡。会上有人说：“地多牲口少，垡不过来”，但又有人说：“牛群里还有闲牛。”此后干部与各互助组组长又在互助组中深入进行秋垡教育，以秋垡与春垡的对比办法，说明秋垡的重要，并纠正了重商轻农的思想。接着，各组皆重新整顿互助，实行自愿结合，于三十日全村即组织起五十四犋牲口上地，没牲口的人也自动向外借牲口垡地。至本月七日，全村三千七百余亩秋地，垡过的只有三分之一，于是全镇各机关团体及公私商号，除挤出七十三头牲口外，又组织人力帮助全镇军干烈属及参战民工刨地，全村亦抽出三十余人刨地，现全村提出：“地不冻，犁不停，人不闲”的口号，争取十六日内突击完成全部垡地。
    【本报太岳十五日电】屯留二区自参军工作结束后，领导上即及时深入动员秋垡，克服了“歇一歇”思想，路村、许村、原村等十二村，并以比比算算认识了秋垡的重要，老君庄算出全村如不垡秋地，则可减少产量四百担，群众大为感动，领导上也就及时提出口号：“犁头上赚公粮”，因此群众反映：“计算不计算，相差一大半，以前咱们就没把这当成一回事。”王村便决定了牲口不运输，女人不住娘家，逢会不赶，遇戏不看。路村群众更宣誓：“地垡不完誓不止”，由此全区男女即投入紧张的秋垡浪潮中，仅路村等十二村统计，自四日至八日五天中，在两千多人五百头牲口突击之下，已垡了一万六千亩，占全部秋地十分之四。
　　沁县四五区人拉犁垡地
    【本报太岳十五日电】沁县四、五两区克服畜力困难，大量组织人拉犁垡地。两区历年来经阎匪之疯狂掠夺，畜力非常缺乏，当四区开村创造人拉犁办法后，区公所便于本月三日组织各村一百五十三个村干部前往该村参观，此后各村即普遍的组织人拉犁，据不完全统计，已有男女人拉犁一百九十四张，平均每天可犁地五百八十二亩。五区首由爆炸杆角村长董忠堂与武委会主任李亮文带头，组织了男女三十五人，拉犁垡地，两天犁地四十二亩。接着沙陀村模范教员田树潘，妇女王月仙等也带领学生及妇女组织了二张人拉犁，至十一日，已将全村秋地垡完。此外，羊庄村村长阎德俊组织起一百五十七人，及六十四个儿童的人拉犁垡地，影响了桃梁、元王等村，都组织起人拉犁，区公所亦号召向他们学习，保证秋地普遍垡一遍。
