    Jilu Yu Border Region [This refers to the area on the border between the provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan] Dispatch, 5th: Shan County is the central area of the Third Sub-district. In the past four months, it has undergone three major "netting and mopping-up" and "nibbling and sweeping" operations by the enemy. It has been tempered and improved in the struggle. It has not been affected by the situation. It has fully ensured that the county does not leave the county, the district does not leave the district, and the village does not leave the village, adhering to the struggle in the hinterland. The county has a heavy burden of supporting the front, but with a spirit of courage, responsibility, and fearlessness of difficulties, it has overcome all work obstacles. At present, the entire county is carrying out the four tasks of supporting the front, production, war, land reform, and re-examination in combination. If the men in the family do not go out, they work in the village. When they go out, they hand over the work to the village cadres. Stretchers are combined with transportation. The stretchers depart with their own supplies, and each stretcher also brings 50 jin of white flour to the army. Women, the elderly, and children produce at home to ensure that the autumn harvest and wheat planting do not leave fields barren. Women grind rice, mill flour, and make shoes for the front lines. Women have organized field protection teams and self-defense teams, and many women have also joined the government. For example, in Zhenmin District, 80% of the villages have organized women's field protection teams and self-defense teams, and 60% of the villages have women participating in politics and serving as village cadres, leading production, self-defense, and re-examination. In addition, training classes are held in various districts to cultivate and improve the abilities of village cadres. The county also runs training classes for district cadres, and is currently investigating black land and distributing fruits, preparing for a major re-examination after the autumn. The combined implementation of the above tasks has yielded the following experience: 1. In terms of ideological understanding, supporting the front is the primary task at present, and we must subordinate everything to the war. 2. The issue of organizing and using forces; the cadres, civilians, and materials supporting the front must be organized and prepared. Stretchers, carts, carrying poles, and laborers must be organized well, and the districts must first conduct inspections. If there is no task, actively engage in production, and thoroughly disperse and store materials; when the order comes, leave immediately. Land reform and production work are mostly carried out by women, the elderly, and children. It is necessary to organize mutual aid groups for collective production, ensuring that: one, the autumn harvest is not neglected, that it is harvested and stored at home; and two, that fields are not left barren, and that the wheat is planted without any waterlogging. Be prepared for battle at all times. When the enemy does not come, it is a small command post. When the enemy comes, it is a large or small armed work team, leading the masses to fight guerrilla warfare, transferring those who need to transfer, and persisting those who need to persist. Everything in the home must be buried securely to ensure that it is not lost. The four tasks can all be taken care of and mastered. The comrades in charge of the overall situation should not move easily to prevent work from being confused.

    事先组织好准备好
    单县各种工作结合进行
    【本报冀鲁豫五日电】单县是三分区的中心区，四个月中经过了敌人三次较大的“拉网清剿”，“蚕食扫荡”，在斗争中得到了锻炼和提高，没有因情况影响工作，完全作到县不离县，区不离区，村不离村，坚持了腹地斗争。该县的支前任务较繁重，但是，他们以勇敢负责不怕困难的精神，克服了一切工作障碍。目前全县是在支前生产、战争、土改、复查四种工作结合进行中。家中男子不出发，就在庄作活，出发时就将工作交给村干。担架与运送结合起来，担架出发自带给养，而且每付担架还给军队捎白面五十斤。妇女老年及儿童在家生产，保证秋收种麦不荒田，妇女碾米、磨面、做鞋子供给前线，妇女组织了保田队、自卫队，还有许多妇女已参加了政权。如振民区百分之八十的村庄组织了妇女保田队、自卫队，百分之六十的村庄妇女参政，当了村干，领导生产自卫和复查等工作。此外，各区召开训练班，培养提高村干的能力，县也开办了区干训练班，现正在查黑地、分果实，准备秋后大复查。以上任务的结合进行，获得如下经验：一、在思想认识方面，支前是当前的首要任务，我们一切要服从战争。二、组织使用力量问题；支前干部民夫和物资都要组织好，准备好担架、大车、挑子、民工，区里先经过检阅。任务不来，则积极生产，物资彻底分散保存；号令一来，马上就走，土改生产工作，大部是依靠妇女老年和儿童来进行。要组织如互助组集体生产。保证一不荒秋，收割到家里并保存起来；二不荒田，不存水地保证把麦子种上。时刻准备战斗，敌不来是小指挥部，敌一来就是大小武工队，领导群众打游击，转移的转移，坚持的坚持，家中一切都要埋藏稳，保证不受损失，四种工作都能照顾掌握，全盘负责同志，最好不要轻易动，防止工作混乱。
