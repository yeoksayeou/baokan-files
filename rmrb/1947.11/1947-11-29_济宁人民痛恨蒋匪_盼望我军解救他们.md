　　【This Dispatch from our Jilu Yu Bureau on the 27th】The people of Jining hate the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and hope that the Liberation Army will quickly liberate them. Since the enemy occupied Jining City in August of the lunar calendar last year, the local masses have suffered increasingly from heavy grain levies over the past year. Each mu [Chinese unit of area] had already yielded 56 jin [Chinese unit of weight, about 1.1 lbs] of wheat, and now each mu of land has to yield 40 jin of sorghum. In addition to the regular items, there are many miscellaneous exactions, such as repairing the city and pillboxes, requiring one to two bricks per mu. Soldiers are constantly being bought, with each recruit requiring 2,500 to 3,000 jin of wheat. Each bao [group of households] needs two or three recruits at a time. During the New Year and holidays, gifts (chickens, pigs, cigarettes, wine, etc.) must be sent to the puppet and die-hard troops and the township office. Every 30 mu of land must provide one gun. The bao chief and jia chief [heads of smaller groups of households within a bao] must also receive monthly subsidies, with each bao chief and jia chief receiving 120 jin of wheat per month, and each bao guard receiving 90 jin per month. In addition to this, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops constantly go to the villages in groups of three or five to extort from the masses. On a certain day in August this year, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits ate the ox of a commoner and threw the ox head into the home of Wang Yuchao in Litun Village. The next day, a group of brutal soldiers found the door and beat Wang's daughter-in-law and Wang Yuchao. As a result, they had to host guests and compensate with an ox to settle the matter. Now, in the villages near the areas occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, every household has run out of grain. For example, the puppet grain collectors in Andi Town take away every last grain, even half a bowl or a bowl and a half of grain from each household. Therefore, the masses extremely hate the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and the people all hope that the Eighth Route Army will liberate them sooner rather than later.

　　济宁人民痛恨蒋匪
  　盼望我军解救他们
    【本报冀鲁豫二十七日电】济宁人民痛恨蒋贼盼望解放军赶快去解放他们。自去年阴历八月敌人侵占济宁城后，一年来，当地群众差粮苛重，痛苦日增，每亩原已出过麦子五十六斤，现每亩地又要高粱四十斤，除正项外，还有许多杂差，如修城、修炮楼，每亩要砖一块至两块。经常买兵，每名需麦子二千五百斤至三千斤，每保一次就要两、三名。过年过节还得给伪顽军队及乡公所送礼（鸡、猪、烟、酒等）。每三十亩地，须出一枝枪。每保保长及甲长每月还要津贴，保长和甲长每月各要麦子一百二十斤，保丁每月九十斤，除此以外，蒋贼部队不断的三、五个成群到村里敲诈群众。今年八月某日，蒋贼吃了老百姓的牛，把牛头丢到李屯庄王玉朝家里，第二天，一群兽兵找到门上，把王家媳妇与王玉朝吊打了一顿，结果请客赔了一头牛，才算了事。现蒋匪所占附近各村庄，家家都已没了粮食。如安底镇伪催粮员，都是挨门挨户一升半碗粮食也要拿走，因此群众极端痛恨蒋贼，人民咸盼八路军早些去解放他们。
