　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: New York Dispatch: Thousands of prominent figures in Puerto Rico recently submitted a joint letter to UN Secretary-General Lie, demanding an end to American imperialist rule in Puerto Rico. (Note: Puerto Rico is located at the eastern end of the West Indies and is currently the largest colony under American imperialism.) The letter contrasts America's false benevolence towards Europe with the situation in Puerto Rico, stating: "For half a century, the people of Puerto Rico under American rule have been subjected to American economic exploitation and political domination, and have been deprived of all opportunities to resolve their own constitutional issues." The letter lists examples proving that the United States has violated the provisions of the United Nations Charter regarding national independence, such as Truman's recent veto of legislation passed by the Puerto Rican legislature authorizing the people to choose their form of government through a plebiscite. The letter requests that the United Nations promptly recommend appropriate action so that the people of the area can freely exercise their right to self-government without external influence. Signatories to the letter include the chairman of the labor union, the chairman of the cultural association, four senators, three members of the House of Representatives, and well-known journalists, engineers, and lawyers.

　　波多黎各各界人民要求脱离美帝羁绊
    【新华社陕北二十日电】纽约讯：波多黎各名流数千人，顷以联合签名之公函一件，提交联合国秘书长莱氏，要求停止美国在波多黎各的帝国主义统治。（按：波多黎各位于西印度群岛之东端，现为美帝属下之最大殖民地。）该函将美国对欧洲之假仁义与其在波多黎各之情形作一对照后称：“半世纪以来，美国统治下的波多黎各人民，即受着美国经济上的剥削与政治上的统治，被剥夺了一切自行解决本身宪法问题之机会。”函内列举例子证明美国违反联合国宪章关于民族独立之规定，例如杜鲁门最近曾否决波多黎各议会通过的授权人民以公民投票选择其政府形式等立法。该函要求联合国尽速建议一适当行动，使该地人民能不受外力影响，自由地行使自治权利。该函签名者有劳工联盟主席、文化协会主席、参议员四人、众议员三人、及著名报人、工程师、律师等人。
