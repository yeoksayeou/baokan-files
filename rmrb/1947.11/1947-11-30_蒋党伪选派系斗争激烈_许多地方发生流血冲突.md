Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th. A Shanghai dispatch from the Associated Press on the 25th reports: Chiang Kai-shek's farce of a "National Assembly" puppet election "has caused new rifts within the Kuomintang." The dispatch quoted the opinions of "some political observers" as saying that this "election" has made Chiang Kai-shek's personal rule "more shaky than before." The Associated Press said: "In the past, within the scope of the Kuomintang Central Committee or national conferences, Chiang was able to instigate various factions to fight each other, while he remained above them, reaping the benefits. Now, this manipulation is more difficult because it involves the complexity of the election mechanism, which gives dissatisfied groups the opportunity to manipulate things themselves." The agency's reporter reported: Just 24 hours after the end of the voting, Kuomintang officials dissatisfied with the election procedures approached Chiang Kai-shek and said that the current nomination system was unfair, allowing some people with "connections" to take advantage. A group of frustrated Kuomintang officials in Chiang's puppet Legislative Yuan, Supervisory Yuan, and Political Participation Council, who were not nominated as candidates for the puppet "National Assembly," warned that if this "error" was not quickly corrected, it would lead to "unfortunate consequences." During Chiang's three-day puppet election, due to the fierce factional struggle within the Kuomintang, bloodshed occurred in many places. Lin, the speaker of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet Senate in Jintan County, Jiangsu, has been killed in an election conflict. Kuomintang elements in Pudong, dissatisfied with the election, instigated rioters to steal ballot boxes, kill a guard, and injure a district head. The same situation occurred in Fujian Province, such as supervisors being beaten, ballot boxes being destroyed, and voters being kidnapped. In Chongqing, an organization called the "candidate assassination squad" was discovered.

　　蒋党伪选派系斗争激烈
  　许多地方发生流血冲突
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】据美联社上海二十五日消息报导：蒋介石所玩弄的“国大”伪选丑剧，“已使国民党内部发生新裂痕”。该消息引据“若干政治观察家”的意见说：这次“选举”反使蒋介石个人的统治地位“比以前更加动摇”了。美联社说：“过去在国民党中央委员会或全国会议的范围内，蒋能够嗾使各派系互相斗争，自己则高居其上，坐操渔翁之利，现在这种操纵是更困难了，因为它涉及了选举机构的复杂性，这种复杂性给不满集团以各自操纵的机会。”该社记者报导：在投票结束仅仅廿四小时之后，不满选举程序的国民党官员就找住蒋介石说：现在的提名制度不公平，使一些有“门路”的人占了便宜。蒋匪立法院、监察院与参政会中一群失意的国民党官员因未被提为伪“国大”候选人，警告说，此一“错误”若不迅速纠正，将招致“不幸的后果”。蒋匪三日伪选中，由于国民党派系斗争之激烈，许多地方发生流血冲突。江苏金坛县蒋匪参议长林某已在选举冲突中被杀。浦东不满选举之国民党分子，唆使暴徒抢走票箱，并打死保丁、打伤区长。福建省也发生同样情形，如监票人被殴打，票箱被破坏，与投票人被绑架等。重庆则发现所谓“候选人暗杀团”的组织。
