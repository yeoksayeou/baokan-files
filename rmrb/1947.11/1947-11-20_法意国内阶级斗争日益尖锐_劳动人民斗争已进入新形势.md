　　Class Struggle in France and Italy Intensifies
　　The Labor People's Struggle Has Entered a New Situation
　　November 10th to 16th

    Over the past week, the working class in Italy and France has launched a great wave of defending democracy and peace and opposing fascism. This reflects the increasing intensification of class struggle in these two countries, and also marks a new situation in the struggle of the laboring people in these two countries.

    In Italy, recently, fascist bandits, under the protection and connivance of the Gasperi authorities—enemies of democracy—have been provoking trouble everywhere, plotting to bomb the Milan headquarters of the Italian Communist Party and massacre the laboring people. This vicious conspiracy immediately aroused a protest demonstration of 150,000 workers in Milan. The Milan General Confederation of Labor announced a general strike to show solidarity. The storm of strikes and demonstrations quickly swept across Italy. In many large cities such as Milan, Naples, and Turin, demonstrators, filled with indignation, smashed fascist headquarters of the Common Man Front, chased and beat fascist elements, and burned fascist newspapers. In Naples, the worker demonstrators carried out resolute and courageous battles, disarming the military police who were carrying out bloody suppression with their bare hands, and "street battles" broke out everywhere. The Italian General Confederation of Labor has resolved to demand that the government immediately dissolve all fascist organizations. Italian Communist Party leader Togliatti called for the establishment of a broader new front of democratic forces and called for resolute struggle in all aspects. Ancient Rome is roaring, and the laboring people are acting for freedom, democracy, labor, and independence.

    In France, to commemorate the armistice day of the First World War, the laboring people of Paris held a large demonstration to defend peace, democracy, and independence. The fighting red flag fluttered in the wind, and the slogan "Demand Ramadier's resignation" resounded throughout the sky. The strike movement of French workers continues to expand. Following the victorious conclusion of the Paris public utilities workers' strike, the Paris flour workers began a strike on the 13th to demand a wage increase, and the workers in Marseille also began a large strike on the 10th to oppose tram fare increases. The strike in Marseille is aimed at the newly appointed Gaullist municipal authorities, and was therefore subjected to a frenzied attack by the De Gaulle fascist elements, resulting in many casualties. However, the strikers further united to struggle. On the 14th, the Marseille General Confederation of Labor decided that all workers would stop work and hold demonstrations during the funeral of the victims. In order to respond to the reactionary government authorities' despicable means of strict suppression, the Marseille General Confederation of Labor has decided to call for a strike throughout the Rhône province, resolutely fighting for the freedom and rights of the laboring people. All of this shows that the French laboring people are exerting their powerful strength to launch a renewed struggle against the De Gaulle fascist elements' usurpation conspiracy and the Ramadier government, which is a smokescreen for them.

    Encouraging news continued to come from the national liberation wars being waged in two countries in Europe and Asia during the week. After the Greek Democratic Army victoriously repelled the fascist government army's desperate offensive last month, it gained the initiative. Currently, it has launched a large-scale new offensive in the central, southern, and northwestern regions, and has continuously achieved brilliant results. The Democratic Army's air force has also participated in the war for the first time. With the expansion of the liberated areas, the headquarters of the Democratic Army has also carried out a lot of democratic construction and consolidation work, established an internal affairs committee, promulgated decrees to help farmers' lives and production, and restored education in the liberated areas, enabling people to live and work in peace and contentment. The American imperialist master is currently trying every means to strengthen its control and assistance to its Greek servants in an attempt to save them from their impending doom. But as an American progressive journalist said: "No American policy can save the bankrupt Greek royalist government."

    The Indonesian people continue to wage a resolute war of self-defense on the main battlefield, and the people's movement resisting the Dutch aggressors is rising in the Dutch-occupied areas. Workers and peasants are striking everywhere, and even in Batavia, there have been repeated mass demonstrations of tens of thousands of people. People of all ethnic groups in various places, though under the high pressure of the Dutch army, still remain loyal and steadfast, reiterating their determination to be loyal to their motherland. This nationwide unity against the enemy is an inexhaustible source of strength for the Indonesian war of resistance and the supreme guarantee of ultimate victory.

    The United Nations General Assembly is still proceeding amidst the fierce struggle between the two camps. Last week, the Special Committee on Palestine unanimously passed a resolution based on the Soviet proposal, setting the end of British imperialism's mandate over Palestine in May next year. The United Nations General Assembly also elected Ukraine to succeed Poland as a non-permanent member of the Security Council, causing the American imperialist obstructionist activities to prevent Ukraine's election to ultimately fail. These are the two major victories of the democratic camp in the struggle at the United Nations General Assembly this week.

### 法意国内阶级斗争日益尖锐　劳动人民斗争已进入新形势

　　法意国内阶级斗争日益尖锐
  　劳动人民斗争已进入新形势
    十一月十日至十六日
    过去一周，意、法两国的工人阶级掀起了保卫民主和平与反对法西斯的大浪潮。这反映了该两国国内阶级斗争的日趋尖锐化，也标志着两国劳动人民斗争的新形势。
    在意大利，最近法西斯匪徒在加斯贝利当局——民主的敌人——的庇护与纵容下，四出挑衅，阴谋爆炸米兰意共总部并残杀劳动人民，此种恶毒阴谋，立即激起了米兰十五万工人的抗议大示威，米兰总工会宣布了总罢工，以示声援。罢工与游行示威的风暴，迅速席卷全意。在米兰、那不勒斯、都灵等许多大城市中，示威者满怀愤激，捣毁法西斯平民党总部，追击与痛殴法西斯分子，焚毁法西斯报刊。那不勒斯的工人示威者更进行了坚决勇敢的战斗，以赤手空拳解除了实行血腥镇压的军警武装，到处发生了短兵相接的“市街战”。意总工会已决议要求政府立即解散一切法西斯组织，意共领袖托格里亚蒂呼吁建立更广大的民主势力的新阵线，并号召在一切方面进行坚决的战斗。古罗马正在怒吼，劳动人民在为自由、民主、劳动、独立而行动起来了。
    在法国，为纪念第一次世界大战休战日，巴黎劳动人民举行了保卫和平、民主、独立的大示威，战斗红旗迎风飘扬，“要拉马第辞职”的口号响彻云霄。法国工人的罢工运动仍继续扩大中。继巴黎公用事业工人大罢工胜利的结束后，巴黎面粉工人自十三日起开始要求增资的罢工，马赛工人自十日也开始了反对电车加价的大罢工。马赛的罢工针对着新上台的戴高乐派市政当局，因此而受到戴高乐法西斯分子的疯狂袭击，致有多人死伤。但是罢工者反而更进一步的团结斗争，十四日马赛总工会决定在为牺牲者出殡时全体工人将停止工作，并举行示威。为了回答反动政府当局严令镇压的卑劣手段，马赛总工会已决定号召全罗尼省的罢工，坚决为劳动人民的自由权利而斗争。这一切显示：法国劳动人民正在施展其强大的力量，向戴高乐法西斯分子的篡夺阴谋以及为其烟幕的拉马第政府，展开再接再厉的斗争。
    欧亚两个国家所进行的民族解放战争，一周间不断传来了令人振奋的消息。希腊民主军于上月间胜利击退了法西斯政府军挣扎性的进攻后，即赢得了主动权，目前于中、南与西北部又开始了大规模的新攻势，并不断取得辉煌的战果，民主军的空军也已首次参战。随着解放区的扩大，民主军总部也进行了许多民主建设和巩固的工作，成立了内政委员会，颁布了帮助农民生活和进行生产的法令，恢复了解放区的教育，使人们得以安居乐业。美帝国主子目前正千方百计加强其对希腊奴仆的控制和援助，以图挽救其垂危。但这正如美国进步记者所说：“任何美国的政策，都不能挽救破产了的希腊保皇党政府。”
    印尼人民在正面战场仍继续进行坚决的自卫战，在荷占领区内抵抗荷兰侵略者的人民运动正在兴起。工人农民到处罢工，甚至在巴城也一再举行万人的大示威。各地各族人民，虽在荷军的高压下，仍坚贞不屈，重申效忠祖国的决心。这种举国一致的敌气同仇，是印尼抗战力量的不竭源泉，与终获胜利的至高保证。
    联大仍在两个阵营的激烈斗争中进行。上周巴勒斯坦特别委员会一致通过了以苏联建议为基础的议案，定于明年五月结束英帝国主义对巴勒斯坦的委任统治，联合国全体大会上又选举了乌克兰继波兰为安理会非常任理事国，使美帝国主义阻挠乌克兰当选的阻险活动终告败北，这是民主阵营一周来在联大斗争中的两大胜利。
