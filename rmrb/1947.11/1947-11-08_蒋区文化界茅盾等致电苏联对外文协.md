    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 6th: According to reports from TASS Shanghai and Nanjing on the 4th and 5th, cultural figures in the Chiang-controlled areas have been sending telegrams to the Soviet Union's Foreign Cultural Association to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the great October Revolution in the Soviet Union. The famous writer Mao Dun said in his congratulatory telegram: "On the 30th anniversary of the Soviet Union's birth, the undeniable and brilliant facts prove that only the Soviet Union's democratic policies and socialist economy can truly guarantee the welfare of all the people, enabling them to obtain freedom, equality, and happiness. The people of China and other countries around the world will never forget the Soviet Union's great contributions to saving civilization, safeguarding democracy, and helping enslaved countries achieve liberation. The Soviet Union is a true friend of all countries seeking freedom, peace, and democracy; a strong and prosperous Soviet Union is a fortress of world peace and democracy. This is not only my personal belief but also the belief of all Chinese people. The friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is built on this belief. I sincerely wish the great Soviet people continuous new victories and achievements."
