    While Comparing Harvests in the Field, Remember Autumn Plowing
    Beizhai Completes Autumn Land Plowing in Ten Days
    [Our Changzhi News] Beizhai Village in the First District is comparing harvests in the field, seeing who has a better autumn harvest and more grain. After comparing and accounting, the enthusiasm for harvesting, threshing, and plowing is very high. Last year, the entire village only plowed 400 mu of land, and most of the rest was not plowed, resulting in a significant loss. The Nantou Second Group was not enthusiastic about plowing. Political Director Lü Liansheng went to Nantou and asked Hu Hai: "Why isn't Nantou enthusiastic about plowing?" Hu Hai said: "Nantou has few livestock, and women have no mutual aid." Liansheng said: "Wang Tianyuan plowed his land last year, and this year one mu can yield 1.8 shi." Li Shui only said: "In my group, Chen Fusuo and Hu Hai's land share the same furrow. Fusuo plowed his land last year, and the corn grew a foot long, with no weeds in the field, and the corn was all good. You and Fusuo are neighbors, but your corn is small, an inch long, with many weeds, and the harvest is small. This is all because you didn't plow the land." The entire village held group meetings to discuss this, and everyone complained that they had suffered a great loss. After comparing the harvests, the masses in the entire village understood, and after calculating, they said not to forget autumn plowing every year. Lü Liansheng led the men and women of the brigade to work together, and they became more and more enthusiastic. The woman Wei Taohua said: "Our women can also do what men do. Everyone should go dig the land!" Under her leadership, thirty-five women dug one hundred mu in nine days, influencing all the women in the village to take action. Liansheng led the male and female laborers to dig 233 mu of land, and ten livestock plowed 380 mu. The original plan was to have the field cleared in half a month, but now all the land has been plowed in nine days. In order to completely transform the village through large-scale labor exchange, the fields are being cleared thoroughly. On the 20th, a meeting of thirty-seven cadre group leaders was held. Lü Liansheng said: "Which group has land that hasn't been plowed yet? Report it. Our village wants to finish ahead of schedule. Our village is competing with Qiu Village. Don't fall behind." Li Shui of Nantou said: "My group has more than 100 mu of land. It's impossible to finish ahead of schedule." Shen Qitang of the Third Group said: "My group has 70 mu of land that hasn't been completed. What should we do?" Zhang Xingsheng, chairman of the farmers' association, said: "Our village has more than 260 mu of land that hasn't been completed. Let's draw out the livestock and concentrate our efforts to finish it in two days." As a result, each group drew out a total of eight teams of livestock to implement labor exchange in Nantou. All 2,672 mu of autumn land in the entire village were completed in ten days, and the fields were cleared, completing the plan five days ahead of schedule. The masses were also very happy eating on the streets. Now fourteen livestock have been drawn out to go to Bitou Village for labor exchange, striving to have all the land in the entire district plowed, leaving no stubble land, and having the fields cleared throughout the district.
