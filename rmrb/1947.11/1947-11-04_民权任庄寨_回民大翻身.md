    Ren Zhuangzhai in Minquan
    Muslims Achieve Great Liberation
    [Report from our newspaper in the Jilu Yu area, dated the 2nd] In Minquan County, on the northern bank of the Longhai Railway, there is a large Muslim area. Ren Zhuangzhai is a village within this Muslim area. Under the conditions of the seesaw guerrilla war, the Muslims of Ren Zhuangzhai suffered the same oppression from the Kuomintang bandits and the bad landlords. The landlord of this village, Ren Yaoseng, nicknamed "Local Pest," relied on his power to bully others, selling opium and lending money at exorbitant interest rates. He once seized the wife of Dan ×× from this village and raped the young daughter of Pan ××. The kind villagers could only seethe with anger in their hearts. When news of the land reform came, the Muslims of Ren Zhuangzhai secretly spread the good news. "Local Pest" Ren Yaoseng learned about the land distribution and immediately spread rumors to scare the masses: "Whoever divides my property and land, when the Central Army fights back, they will have to deliver it back to my house properly, or I will skin you alive!" Honest farmers did not dare to confront this bad guy. The government arrested him. On the afternoon of the 13th, in response to the demands of the people of Ren Zhuangzhai, the government executed "Local Pest." A seventy-year-old woman, Grandma Ren, happily said, "We are no longer afraid of him!" The masses also arrested the former head of the Baojia system. They elected their own village leaders and farmers' association leaders and immediately carried out the distribution of movable property and land. In one day, they found 9,200 jin of wheat and distributed the property and land according to the principle of leveling up and making up the difference. The oppressed Muslims were liberated, possessing land, livestock, grain, clothing, and freedom. The Muslims also requested seven rifles and armed themselves.
    [Report from our newspaper in the Jilu Yu area, dated the 1st] In the counties south of the Yellow River, under the conditions of the seesaw guerrilla war, the peasants of Heze, Kaocheng, Minquan, Qibin, Dingtao, etc., are actively carrying out land reform. The peasants of Minquan County suffered layers of exploitation from the Kuomintang bandits and landlords. The masses were constantly hoping that we would lead them in dividing the land. In Zhanglou Village, out of 58 households and 13 qing of land, the landlord occupied 11.96 qing. The masses wanted to divide the land, but they were afraid of retaliation from the landlord. At this time, the cadres expressed to the masses: we will swear to maintain the situation and support the masses, allowing the masses to freely come up with their own methods to divide the land and movable property. The masses quickly took action. The land reform in Kaocheng is becoming more and more thorough. Xie Lin Village found a large amount of movable property from the landlord, including 16 livestock, more than 50,000 jin of grain, and 15,000 jin of salt.
