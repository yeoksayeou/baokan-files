Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th. Paris dispatch: After a week of frantic scrambling, the French reactionaries have hoisted up Robert Schuman, France's new executioner, to succeed Ramadier as the French Prime Minister. Over the past week, a group of American lackeys who sell out the French nation, such as Reynaud, de Gaulle, and Blum, have all been vying to come to power, but have all failed due to infighting among the reactionaries. Blum had confidently brought his anti-communist and anti-people platform to the parliament seeking authorization, but he was met with 277 votes against and returned in shame. On the 22nd, amid the increasingly high tide of strikes and the tense situation of the French Communist Party and the French people firmly advocating the establishment of a democratic government, the reactionaries quickly turned to mutual compromise and collusion, jointly electing the leader of the Popular Republican Movement and former Finance Minister Schuman to form a cabinet, in an attempt to "save" their regime, which was about to be submerged in the tide of popular resistance, in this "last chance" (as stated by the General Secretary of the French Socialist Party). According to Agence France-Presse: On the afternoon of the 22nd, Schuman announced in parliament an anti-communist and anti-people platform that was "very similar to Blum's statement," threatening on the one hand that "strikes may be detrimental to those who recklessly use them"; on the other hand, he wailed to his American masters: "Foreign aid is absolutely indispensable to France." The leader of the French Communist Party, Duclos, immediately criticized this, saying: "Schuman is the embodiment of a policy that is absolutely hostile to the working masses," and "his platform will be entirely beneficial to the United States and its capitalist system."

　　法国新刽子手舒曼组阁
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】巴黎讯：经过一周慌乱的奔波，法国反动派已抬出法国人民的新刽子手舒曼继拉马第为法总理。一周来，雷诺、戴高乐、勃鲁姆等一批贩卖法兰西民族的美国客，都争想上台，但由于反动派内部的勾心斗角，均告失败。勃鲁姆曾很自信的挟着反共反人民的政纲到议会中求取授权，结果却遭到二七七票的反对而赧然回去。二十二日，在罢工运动愈加高涨及法共和法国人民坚决主张成立民主政府的紧张局势下，反动派即急转而互相妥协勾结，共举人民共和党首脑前财长舒曼组阁，以图在此“最后机会”（法社会党总书记语）中，“拯救”他们在人民反抗怒潮中行将淹沉的政权。据法新社称：二十二日下午舒曼于议会中宣布“与勃鲁姆的声明全部都很相似”的反共反人民的政纲，一方面威吓地说：“罢工或将不利于那些胡乱利用罢工的人们”；另一方面又向其美国主子哀鸣着：“外援对法国是绝不可少的”。法共领袖杜克洛当场予以抨击称：“舒曼就是绝对敌视工人大众政策的化身”，“他的政纲将完全有利于美国及其资本主义制度。”
