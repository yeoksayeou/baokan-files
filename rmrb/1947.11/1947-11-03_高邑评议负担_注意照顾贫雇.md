    Gao Yi Discusses Burden Sharing:
    Attention to Poor and Hired Peasants
    [Our Gao Yi News] Since the counter-offensive grain task was assigned to the villages in Gao Yi, the masses have launched a heated rice milling and grain delivery campaign. Fang Tan village cadres, in order to ensure that the burden was truly fair and reasonable, first checked the issue of the burden of summer grain storage. Everyone agreed that the burden on the poor and hired peasants for summer grain was heavy. Based on the situation in their village, they proposed that autumn storage should take care of the poor and hired peasants, especially those who have not yet fully turned themselves around. During the inspection, everyone compared specific households and unanimously agreed that those with complete livestock and farm tools should not bear the same burden as those with only one leg of livestock and a few waterwheels. After the eighteen appraisers of Gucheng discussed it, and then after a discussion by the masses of the whole village, the burden was appropriately reduced or exempted for nineteen households who could not afford public grain (including fifteen poor and hired peasants who had not yet fully turned themselves around, and four military dependents). In Dongdaying, there were only seven grindstones in the whole village. The emancipated peasant Lu Xing stayed up late to grind rice for the counter-offensive. The whole village also formulated a grain delivery plan. Women and children in Gucheng organized groups to carry out rice milling competitions to help the poor and hired peasants without livestock to mill rice, and specifically divided the work. The boys pushed the grindstone, and the girls winnowed the rice. On the night of the fourth day of the ninth lunar month, they milled five dou of rice for Zhao Qinglan, a military dependent. In Zhongdaying, the campaign of delivering grain featured "three excellences," namely excellent fineness, excellent quality, and excellent speed, milling 7,500 jin of rice in three days and nights. Now the masses in the entire county of Gao Yi are enthusiastically striving to hand in counter-offensive military grain. (Gao Yi Joint Office)

    【本报高邑讯】高邑自反攻粮任务到各村后，群众即展开了热烈的碾米交粮运动，坊坍村干为了负担真正公平合理，首先将屯夏粮的负担问题作了检查，大家一致认为夏粮贫雇负担重，根据本村情况提出秋屯要照顾贫雇，特别要照顾没有翻透身的贫雇。在检查中大家拿了具体户作了对比，一致认为畜力、农具齐全的，不能与牲口是一根腿、水车几家伙一挂的一样负担。古城经过了十八名评议员评议后，又经过全村群众讨论，有十九户拿不起公粮的户（其中十五户未翻透身的贫雇、四户军属），适当的减免负担。东大营全村只有七盘碾，翻身农民鲁行，晚上不睡觉赶碾反攻米，全村并订出了交粮计划。古城妇女儿童组织了小组，开展了碾米竞赛，来帮助无畜力的贫雇碾米，并具体的分了工，男儿童推碾，女儿童簸米，在阴九月初四日一夜就给军属赵清兰碾米五斗。中大营在交粮中开展了“三又”，即又细、又好、又快，三日夜碾米七千五百斤。现在高邑全县群众都在热烈的争交反攻军粮。（高邑联合办公室）
