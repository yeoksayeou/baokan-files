    Store Bran and Accumulate Vegetables to Prevent Spring Famine
    Lingdi, She County
    Overcome Complacency and Self-Satisfaction
    10,000 Jin of Vegetables Gathered in Three Days
    [Our Newspaper, She County News] After the completion of wheat planting in Lingdi Village, Sixth District, the masses and cadres relaxed their efforts in organizing the remaining labor force and the gleaning and cutting movement. They believed that once the wheat was planted, they would have enough to live on. The leadership put forward the slogan: "Bran and vegetables for half a year, prepare to get through the spring famine next year!" The masses, such as Zhang Cihu, said: "I grow so many vegetables that I can't even finish eating them, why should I gather wild vegetables!" Understanding this complacent thinking, a meeting of cadres, poor peasants, and activists was convened to study and discuss the issue. Cadre Zhao Yintang said: "I can't understand why we should gather wild vegetables and pick bean leaves when I have more turnips and radishes than I can eat." Poor peasant cadre Li Yitang said: "This year is not a good year. Although there are vegetables in the fields, we cannot be complacent. Will we really have enough to eat until the next harvest?" This question sparked a discussion among everyone. Finally, everyone agreed that the only way to get through next year's spring famine was to gather vegetables now. After overcoming the complacent thinking, the next day, poor peasant woman Li Meiyu led seventeen women to gather vegetables. In the evening, the radio station broadcast propaganda about this, which influenced 173 men, women, and children throughout the village. In three days, they gathered a total of 10,099.5 jin of vegetables. After completing the vegetable gathering, they organized two pairs of livestock to go out and sell labor, and sixty-one people went out to sell their labor to prepare for gleaning and cutting to hand in public grain and support the front lines to defeat Chiang Kai-shek.

    存糠积菜  预防春荒
    涉县岭底
    打破麻痹自满
    三天打菜万斤
    【本报涉县讯】六区岭底全村完成串麦后，群众干部对组织剩余劳力及拾砍运动是放松的，认为串上麦子就没有生活，领导上提出口号是“糠菜半年粮，准备明年渡春荒！”群众张磁壶说：“我种的好菜还吃不完哩，还打野菜哩！”了解这个麻痹思想，即召开干部贫雇积极分子会议研究讨论，干部赵银堂说：“叫打野菜采豆叶，我思想就弄不通，光蔓菁、萝葡就吃不完哩。”贫雇干部李义堂说：“今年年景不好，虽然地里有菜，可不能自满，是否能吃到明年青黄不接的时候？”这样一提，引起了大家的讨论。最后大家一致认为要想度过明年青黄不接，现在只有打菜。打破麻痹思想后，第二天贫雇妇女李梅玉就带领十七个妇女去打菜，黄昏就在电台上广播宣传，这样影响起全村男女老少一百七十三人，三天共打菜一万零九十九斤半。完成打菜后，又组织了两犋牲口出外卖晌，六十一人出外卖工，准备拾砍交公粮，支援前线打倒蒋介石。（成元、长庆、振华）
