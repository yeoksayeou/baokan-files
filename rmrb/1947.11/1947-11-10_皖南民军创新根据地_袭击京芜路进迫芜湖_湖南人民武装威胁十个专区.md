    Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 7th: As our army's counter-offensive on the southern front achieves successive victories, the people's armed forces in Anhui and Zhejiang are actively attacking Chiang Kai-shek's important communication lines, eliminating Chiang Kai-shek's district and township armed forces, and establishing new base areas. According to reports from Shanghai's Ta Kung Pao and other sources last month: the highways from Nanjing to Wuhu and from Wuhu to Tunxi are frequently attacked by the Anhui people's armed forces. The people's armed forces have advanced from Ningguo County, which is 100 li from Wuhu, to Zhao Jiahu area within Wuhu, which is less than 30 li from the urban area. The people's armed forces in Xuxi County destroyed the Wu-Tun highway, dismantled more than 100 telephone poles and several bridges from Congshangguan in Xuxi County northward to Guanyinqiao in Ningguo County, cutting off communication between Xu and Ning. At the same time, the people's armed forces of this county attacked the Chiang Kai-shek's Second District Joint Defense Team at the end of September, killing and wounding five people including the head of the bandit joint defense team, Zhou Yejiang. In continuous attacks, they captured dozens of guns from the township public offices of Da'ao, Longjing, Jiuhua, Huoxi, Gemeng, and Dengta. On September 2nd and 14th, they attacked the Chiang Kai-shek's Third District Joint Defense Team stationed in Dazhang Township twice, capturing the team leader Hu Qintao, seizing 18 rifles, 36 hand grenades, and more than 500 rounds of ammunition. The people's armed forces that captured Jingxian and Maolin have established new base areas and mobilized the masses to carry out liquidation struggles. The people's armed forces in the suburbs of Dingyuan City in northern Anhui frequently attacked the passage from Dingyuan to Linhuaiguan. At the beginning of last month, they captured Yiji, Daxiao, Xiangsi, Shengli and other towns within Dingyuan in one fell swoop, threatening Xisanshilidian, Zhujiawan and other places. In addition, a part of the people's armed forces in eastern Zhejiang landed at Jinshan Street, a stronghold on the Qiantang River, on more than 20 ships on the 14th of last month. After fierce fighting with the local Chiang Kai-shek bandits, they retreated in the direction of Zhapu. The Chiang Kai-shek’s Haining County government was panicked and imposed martial law and resumed curfew.
    Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 8th: The people's armed forces on the borders of Hunan, Guangxi, Guangdong, and Jiangxi, and in northern Hunan are becoming increasingly active. According to a report in Chiang Kai-shek's Central Daily News in Shanghai on the 14th of last month: at the "Provincial Security Conference" held by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Hunan in early September, the reports of ten special commissioners all confessed that they were threatened by the people's armed forces. Ou Guan, the special commissioner of the Seventh District of Hunan under Chiang Kai-shek, confessed that the people's armed forces active in northern Guangxi in August spread to four counties and twenty-two townships within a few days, and entered Daoxian and Jianghua in southern Hunan on the 13th of the same month. The southern border of Hunan is also frequently attacked by the people's armed forces in Renhua, Ruyuan, Lechang and other counties in northern Guangdong, and Dayu area in southwestern Jiangxi. At the junction of Mayang County in western Hunan and Tongren in eastern Guizhou, there are also people's armed forces frequently active. The areas of Pingjiang and Xiangyin in northern Hunan are scattered with people's armed forces in teams of dozens or hundreds of people.
