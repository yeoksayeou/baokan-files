Xinhua News Agency, East China, 2nd: Further ironclad evidence has been obtained that Chiang Kai-shek’s troops in Central Jiangsu are retaining Japanese soldiers. On the 14th of last month, the masses in Zishi (Xin County, located northwest of Rugao, under the jurisdiction of Hai'an) captured Fukuda Ken, a Japanese soldier retained by the 306th Regiment of the 102nd Brigade of the Kuomintang's reorganized 4th Division. He is from Okinawa (belonging to the Ryukyu Islands), 24 years old this year. He came to the Chinese battlefield in 1942. After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, he was retained by the Kuomintang's reorganized 4th Division in Jiujiang. Last year, he followed the division to Central Jiangsu to participate in the utterly inhuman "encirclement and suppression" campaign of bloody massacres in the four counties of Rugao, Taixing, Taizhou, and Jingjiang. According to his confession: "In the 306th Regiment of the 102nd Brigade alone, there are 27 Japanese soldiers. The First and Third Battalions each have eight people, the Second Battalion has nine people, and the regimental headquarters has two people. The First Battalion has heavy machine gunner Kiyotoku Kubo, gunner Kazuo Takasaki, Sadaaki Okada, and others."
