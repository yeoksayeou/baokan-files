　　Relying on Poor and Hired Peasants to Persistently Implement
    Achieving 80% of a 50% Harvest
  　Qutou Village in Jincheng Increases Production by 800 Shi
    [This newspaper's Taiyue 13th dispatch] Qutou Village in Jincheng proposed "Striving for 80% yield in a 50% year" during drought prevention and preparedness. This plan, relying on the poor and hired peasants to persist in its implementation, was successfully achieved, resulting in an additional harvest of over 800 shi of grain. The mutual aid team in the village was led by Niu Zhaojun, a poor peasant, who experienced hunger and near starvation during the famine of 1932. Therefore, he actively led the entire village in mutual aid for drought resistance and production, expanding the mutual aid groups to 458 households with 1,558 people. When the drought struck in June this year, the government called for drought prevention and preparedness, but many middle peasants despondently shouted, "It's no use!" "It'll be like 1932 again!" And they proposed, "What's the point of mutual aid when the sky is so red!" Some simply stayed home and didn't move. Niu Zhaojun was not discouraged by this kind of threat. On the one hand, he explained the specific circumstances of the starvation in 1932, and on the other hand, he called on everyone to hoe the seedlings more. Some middle peasants were unwilling to do so, so he and the poor and hired peasants took the lead, saying, "There is water in the hoe; hoeing one more time will make it drought-resistant for three days!" He hoed the entire village's 3,010 mu of millet twice. After the rain, some millet fields were lacking seedlings, and some middle peasants shouted again, "Even if we hoe and it rains again, it will only be a 50% harvest!" Niu Zhaojun was not convinced, so he proposed striving for an 80% yield in a 50% year, saying, "Millet hoed seven times yields round grains, millet hoed nine times doesn't need milling!" He first used his own three mu of millet as an experiment, hoeing one mu once, one mu twice, and one mu three times, as evidence for striving for an 80% harvest. At the same time, he led everyone to actively reclaim wasteland to plant radishes. Under his and the poor peasant group leaders' leadership, each group reclaimed 210 mu of wasteland, planting beans and radishes, and replanting radish etc. in the millet fields and cotton fields, and then hoed all the beans once. At harvest time, Niu Zhaojun's three mu of millet yielded one dou per mu for the one-time hoeing, eight dou for the two-time hoeing, and one shi for the three-time hoeing. The village's 3,010 mu of millet hoed three times yielded an additional 600 shi, the reclaimed 210 mu of wasteland yielded an additional 80 shi of beans, and the replanted radishes yielded an additional 1.6 million jin. Calculated at 10,000 jin per shi of grain, this was an additional 166 shi of grain. Now, each courtyard in the village is piled with large, fat radishes. Old man Wu Hua's family of three harvested 13,000 jin, and he happily said as he carried them to the city to sell every day, "Radishes alone are enough for half a year's worth of grain!" At present, all the men in the brigade are plowing the land, and the women are making dishes. Their slogan is, "Plow the land well and make good dishes, so there will be no difficulties next spring."

　　依靠贫雇坚持贯澈
    五成年景收到八成
  　晋城渠头村增产八百石
    【本报太岳十三日电】晋城渠头村在防旱备荒中曾提出了“五成年景争取八成收”，这一计划，依靠贫雇坚持贯澈下来，并胜利达成，多收粮食八百余石。该村互助大队由贫雇牛照俊领导，他在三十二年灾荒时尝尽了饥饿，甚至几乎饿死，所以此次防旱备荒中积极领导全村互助抗旱生产，互助组发展到四百五十八户一千五百五十八人。在今年六月天旱时，政府号召防旱备荒，许多中农便丧气的喊着：“不行！”“那又象三十二年那样了！”并且提出：“天这样红还互助干什！”有的就干脆坐在家里不动弹了。牛照俊没有因这种威胁而泄气，他一面说明三十二年饿死人的具体情况，一面又号召大家多锄苗，有些中农不愿干，他就和贫雇先带头，他说：“锄头有水，多锄一遍耐旱三天！”将全村三千零一十亩谷锄了两遍。落雨后，有些谷地缺苗，有些中农又喊着：“再锄再落雨也是五成收成！”牛照俊不服气，便提出五成年景争取八成收，他说：“谷锄七遍米颗圆，谷锄九遍不上碾！”并首先将自己的三亩谷子作为试验，将一亩锄一遍，一亩锄两遍，一亩锄三遍，作为争取八成收的证据，同时又领导大家积极开荒种萝卜，各组在他与贫雇组长的领导下，开了二百一十亩荒地，种上豆子与萝卜，又将谷地棉花地补上萝卜等，再将所有豆子锄了一遍。秋收时，牛照俊的三亩谷锄一遍的每亩打了一斗，锄两遍的打八斗，锄三遍的打一石。全村锄三遍的三千零一十亩谷子，就多收六百石，开的二百一十亩荒多打八十石豆，补种的萝卜多收一百六十余万斤，以每万斤顶一石粮计算，又多增粮一百六十六石。现在全村各院堆满了肥大的萝卜。吴化老汉一家三口人就收了一万三千斤，每天担上去城里卖，他高兴的说：“光萝卜也顶半年粮！”目前全大队男人进行垡地，妇女做菜，其口号是“垡好土地做好菜，明年春天没困难。”
