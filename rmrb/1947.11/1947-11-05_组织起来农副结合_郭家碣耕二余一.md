	Organize and Combine Agriculture and Sideline Occupations
	Guo Jiajie Cultivates Two, Saves One

	[Report from Huguan by our newspaper] Guo Jiajie in the Sixth District is a small village of thirty-three households, with a total population of one hundred and twenty-seven people and three hundred and twenty-one and seven-tenths mu of land, averaging two and a half mu of land per person. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, seventy percent were tenant farmers, and the masses lived in hunger and cold. After liberation in 1943, rent and interest reductions were implemented, and the masses were initially able to breathe a sigh of relief. However, because the masses had been exploited by landlords for so long, their lives were still not well-fed and clothed. After the land reform last winter, the feudal landlords were thoroughly eliminated, and the masses were able to stand up. This spring, under the leadership of labor hero Feng Haike, they were fully organized, implemented labor exchange and mutual aid, and on the basis of the "Three Great Combinations," they created an agricultural cooperative, which began to be tested this autumn and achieved initial success. After this inspection, the village's sideline occupation profits exceeded any previous year. This investigation was carried out door-to-door, based on actual income and expenditure. Of the village's thirty-three households, excluding five struggle targets, seven households achieved "cultivate one, save one," ten households achieved "cultivate two, save one," and eleven households achieved "cultivate three, save one." Among them, eight households of military dependents achieved "cultivate one, save one" for three households, "cultivate two, save one" for two households, and "cultivate three, save one" for three households. The village average has reached "cultivate two, save one." Its reliance is mainly on being organized, with agriculture as the main focus and the development of sideline occupations. For example, the emancipated peasant Qin ZhaoSuo, with land yielding nine shi four dou two sheng of grain, earned eight shi four dou nine sheng of rice from sideline occupations based on nine months of statistics, accounting for nearly half of his agricultural income. Such achievements can only be achieved in the case of organized agricultural and sideline combinations. The whole village of Guo Jiajie received a total of seven hundred and fifty-five shi of grain (based on actual grain receipts, including all miscellaneous grains). Among them, forty-six and eight-tenths mu of hemp land yielded one hundred and sixty-three shi three dou of grain, averaging three shi five dou per mu. Sideline occupation income, calculated over nine months (including all sideline occupations, including textile transportation workshop funds, etc.), totaled one hundred and twenty-four shi three dou of rice, which converted to two hundred and seven shi one dou six sheng of coarse grain at a 60% conversion rate, accounting for less than one-third of land income. The total land income and sideline occupation income totaled nine hundred and sixty-two shi one dou. According to actual calculations for the entire village, after deducting all annual consumption (including public grain, public funds, food, and miscellaneous expenses), which totaled four hundred and seventy-three shi one dou of coarse grain, four hundred and eighty-nine shi of grain can be saved each year, and the entire village has achieved "cultivate two, save one." After Guo Jiajie accurately calculated the assets of each household this time, the calculated figures were read to everyone, and everyone discussed them. Everyone unanimously recognized that only by organizing could "cultivate three, save one" be achieved. For example, the emancipated peasant Qin ZhaoSuo happily said: "I've lived for more than thirty years, and I've never seen so much money earned this year, and I've even achieved 'cultivate one, save one'!"

    组织起来农副结合
    郭家碣耕二余一
    【本报壶关讯】六区郭家碣是三十三户的一个小村，全村人口一百二十七口，土地三百二十一亩七分，每人平均二亩半地。抗战前十分之七是佃户，群众生活饥寒交迫。四三年解放后，实行了减租减息，群众初步喘过气来，因群众受地主剥削过深，生活上仍然不能饱暖。经过去冬土改后，把封建地主彻底消灭，群众才翻了身。今春在劳英冯海科领导下，全面组织起来，实行折工变工，在三大结合的基础上，并创造出土地合作社，在今秋已开始实验，并获得了初步成功。经过这次检查，该村组织起来副业获利超过已往任何一年，这次调查一律挨门挨户按实收实支调查，全村三十三户，除五户斗争对象外，达到耕一余一七户，耕二余一十户，耕三余一十一户，内有八户军属，达到耕一余一三户，耕二余一二户，耕三余一三户，按全村平均已达到耕二余一。他的依托条件主要是组织起来，农业为主并发展了副业。如翻身农民秦赵锁，土地收粮折米九石四斗二升，副业收入按九个月统计，赚米八石四斗九升，占农业收入将近一半。这样的成绩只有在组织起来农副结合的情况下才能行。郭家碣全村收粮（按实收粮统计包括一切杂粮在内）七百五十五石，内有四十六亩八分麻地就收粮一百六十三石三斗，麻地每亩平均三石五斗，副业收入按九个月算帐（一切副业在内，包括纺织运输作坊资金等），共获利折米一百廿四石三斗，按六扣折粗粮二百零七石一斗六升，占土地收入不到三分之一，土地收入副业收入共合九百六十二石一斗，按全村实际计算，除全年一切消耗（包括公粮公款伙食杂支）共需粗粮四百七十三石一斗外，每一年能存粮四百八十九石，全村达到“耕二余一”。郭家碣从这次按户精确算家当以后，把各户计算数念给大家，由大家展开讨论，大家都一致认识了只有组织起来才能达到耕三余一。如翻身农民秦赵锁高兴的说：“我活了三十多年啦，没见赚过今年这样多的钱，我并达到了耕一余一”。（瑞华）
