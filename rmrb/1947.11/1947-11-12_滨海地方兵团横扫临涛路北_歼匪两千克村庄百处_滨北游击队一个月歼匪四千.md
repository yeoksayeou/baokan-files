Xinhua News Agency, East China, 10th. The Binhai Local Troops, on the 4th and 5th, swept across the area north of Lin(yi)tao(luo) Road, east of Tangtou Taipingzhuang on the old Tai(erzhuang)Wei(xian) Road, and west of the Shu River. Wherever they went, local Chiang elements and Chiang's "Returning Home Corps" were annihilated. Chiang's 83rd Division sent a battalion of troops to reinforce Tangtou, but they were also repelled. A total of over 200 were killed or wounded, over 1,300 Chiang's troops including a battalion commander were captured alive, and over 100 villages were recovered. On the 6th, a battalion of Chiang's 83rd Division once again colluded with the puppet traitor Wang Hongjiu's troops, numbering about a regiment, and advanced along the north of Lintao Road to the Chengzihu area, attempting to reinforce and counterattack, but were again repelled by another unit of our army, which killed or wounded over 200 of them, forcing them to flee in disarray.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 9th. The Binhai District Local Troops, in coordination with local armed forces and militia, captured more than ten important strongholds of Chiang's bandits on the Lin(yi)Qing(kou) Road on the 29th of last month, including Chonggou and Wu Huang Temple, and forced the enemy at Xianggongzhuang on the Lin(yi)Tao(luo) Road and the Chiang's puppet "Returning Home Corps" in the surrounding areas to retreat, uniting the area east of the Yi River in Linyi and Linshu (newly established county) into one contiguous area. In this campaign, 116 members of Chiang's 83rd Division commando team were killed or wounded, 35 were captured alive, over 10 local Chiang elements were killed, and over 500 were captured, for a total of over 660 enemies annihilated.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 10th. From September 9th, when Chiang's bandits invaded Zhucheng, to October 15th, when the People's Liberation Army recovered the city, our Binbei District local armed forces widely launched guerrilla warfare for 36 days, capturing a total of 3,039 enemies, killing or wounding 960 enemies, and destroying 8 enemy vehicles. When the Chiang bandits fleeing south passed through Taipei, the landmines laid in 103 villages were triggered, and the enemy was as if trapped in a sea of fire, suffering heavy casualties.
