Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. According to a report in the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao on the 15th of last month, a severe grain shortage has occurred in Jiangnan, a traditionally wealthy rice-producing area under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. In Wujin, Jiangsu, the price of millet has exceeded 600,000 yuan per stone, and the rice market has been suspended for several days. Workers in various handicrafts industries are requesting wage adjustments due to high prices and difficult living conditions. In Chongming, the price of rice has exceeded 800,000 yuan, causing great panic among the people. In Jiaxing, Wenling, and other counties in the Taizhou area (around Tiantai) of Zhejiang, rice prices have soared in recent days, with market prices ranging from 420,000 to 615,000 yuan per stone, while glutinous rice has risen to 760,000 yuan per stone. Meat merchants in Wenzhou, due to high rice prices and heavy taxes, held a meeting and decided to strike for two days to protest. In Yushan, Jiangxi, as grain prices soared, the Farmers Bank, a private enterprise of Chiang Kai-shek, took the opportunity to purchase large quantities of rice, causing grain prices to rise viciously and uncontrollably. In Bengbu, Anhui, the price of rice has risen to 800,000 yuan per stone, and other coarse grains have also risen sharply, and recently there are prices but no supply, causing citizens to complain endlessly.

　　米仓江南粮荒严重
    【新华社陕北十八日电】据沪大公报上月十五日披露，蒋匪统治下素称富庶产米区域之江南，已发生严重米荒。江苏武进每石小米已越出六十万元，连米市场亦停顿多日。各种手工业工人均因物价高涨，生活艰难，纷纷请求调整工资。崇明米价则已越出八十万元大关，人民甚为恐慌。浙江嘉兴温岭及台属（天台一带）各县，连日米价狂涨，每石市价约在四十二至六十一万五千之间，糯米每石则涨至七十六万元。温州肉商更因米价高涨，捐税苛重，同业集会议决罢市二天，以示抗议。江西玉山正当粮价飞涨之际，蒋贼私产之农民银行乘机大量收购稻谷，致粮价恶性暴涨，一发不可收拾。又安徽蚌埠米价每石涨至八十万元，其他杂粮莫不扶摇直上，近且有价无市，市民均叫苦连天。
