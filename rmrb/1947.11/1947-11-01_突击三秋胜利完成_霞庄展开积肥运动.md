    Victorious Completion of the Autumn Harvest Rush: Xia Village Launches Manure Collection Campaign

    [Our newspaper's report from Licheng] After twenty days of intense effort, Xia Village has victoriously completed the autumn harvest, wheat sowing, and turning over of the fallow land. On September 24th, a meeting of the Technical Committee and leaders of various mutual aid teams and cadres was held to discuss future work. Labor Hero Wang Fengqi said, "Now that the harvesting and plowing are finished, only some cotton and vegetables are left, which can be taken care of incidentally. I think the most important task now is manure collection. We must organize it well and turn all the straw and leaf litter into fertilizer; this is a serious matter." This was immediately agreed upon by everyone. After discussion, everyone proposed launching another manure collection campaign. Each team would organize itself and make specific plans, thinking of all possible ways to collect more manure. The time frame was set at half a month. The following four methods for collecting manure were studied: 1. Composting: Corn stalks and various straw and leaf litter are composted. Long pieces are cut into three- or four-finger-length pieces, and then layered, sprinkled with water, mixed with soil, and piled up. When sprinkling water, it should be just wet enough. When the soil is sprinkled on and mixed, the soil should stick to the surface completely, without water running off. Too much water will cause it to rot poorly, and too little will cause it to burn. When piling it up, put a layer of donkey and horse manure at the bottom to promote heat and decomposition. The pile should be located in a warm, leeward, sunny place, and it is better to pile it up in a pit. Finally, cover the surface with soil. Turn it over every twenty days (the interval can be longer after freezing). This way, it can be thoroughly decomposed and used on the land in the spring. A good field of corn stalks and straw can fertilize one mu of land. 2. Heap manure: As the saying goes, "A sweeping broom makes a long manure pile." After autumn, various tree leaves and grass wither, and there are many fallen leaves in the streets and yards. Organize women and children to sweep every four or five days, and pile the swept material and street soil in the manure pit. It will slowly decompose and then be used on the land. Because these things contain various fertilizing substances, they are a very good fertilizer. In this way, each household can accumulate a large pile every winter. 3. Accumulate wastewater fertilizer: Each household should prepare a small jar or broken pot to accumulate wastewater from washing faces, scrubbing pots, etc., day by day. Every few days, carry it to the toilet and mix it with night soil to compost. This makes a good fertilizer, which is best for growing vegetables. 4. Frequently pad the animal pen: Many people do not pay attention to padding the livestock pen. The pen is very wet, which prevents the accumulation of manure and is unsanitary. Padding should be frequent. Each animal should be padded with a load of soil every two days, preferably street soil or leaf litter and straw residue. When the livestock trample on it, it becomes good fertilizer. At least one load of fertilizer can be accumulated every two days, and the livestock can be healthier. Since the study, each team has returned to carry out mobilization and organization work. Work has now begun, and everyone is very enthusiastic. (Lian Xiang, Mai Sheng)

    [Our newspaper's report from Changzhi] In the first district, Cui Zhang Village has thirty-six head of livestock that are exclusively used for plowing and do not do odd jobs. The village has 1,400 mu of stubble land, of which 836 mu have now been plowed. The workforce is being expanded by thirty people, and everyone is plowing the land from early morning until dark. It can be completed in three days. The entire village has paid its public grain quota, and is now preparing to collect large amounts of manure to prepare good fertilizer for next year.

    突击三秋胜利完成  霞庄展开积肥运动
    【本报黎城讯】霞庄经过二十天突击，收秋改麦秋垡地已胜利完成，九月二十四日，召开技术委员会和各互助组长、干部会议，讨论以后的工作。劳英王逢奇说：“现在收耕完啦，就留下些棉花、蔬菜不能弄，捎带弄弄就行，我瞧最要紧的工作，就是积肥，好好组织一下，把秸草叶沫都造成肥，可是个正事。”马上得到全体同意，经过了讨论，大家提出再来个积肥运动，各组组织各组，具体订计划，要想尽各种办法来多积肥，时间上大家决定在半月内完成，积肥的技术，研究出如下四种办法：一、沤肥、玉茭秆和各种秸草叶沫等沤肥，长的用刀切成三、四指长的碎节，一层一层的扑上水，撒上土拌匀，堆起来。扑水要注意扑湿就行，撒上土一混拌，土全粘在上面，不流出水来为宜，水太多了烂不好，太少了怕烧坏。在堆时垫在下边一层驴马肥，使他引热腐烂，堆的地点在背风向阳的温暖处，弄个坑堆起来更好，最后把土盖在表皮，盖好，每二十天翻倒一次（上冻后时间可长些），这样在明春就能沤烂上地，很好，一亩好玉茭杆和秸草，能上一亩地。二、堆肥：俗话说“扫帚响肥堆长。”秋后各种树叶草木均萎枯，街道院里草木落叶很多，每四、五天组织妇女、儿童打扫一次，把扫住的东西和道土堆在肥坑里，慢慢腐烂后上地，因这些东西里含有各种肥质，是一种很好的肥料，这样一冬每户都能积个大堆。三、积污水肥：每户搞一个小缸或烂锅，将洗脸、刷锅等弄出的污水，一天一天都倒入积起；隔几天担上倒入厕所内，和＠肥混合沤一沤，就成好肥料，种蔬菜最好。四、勤垫圈：有很多人不注意垫牲口圈，圈里很湿，既不能多积肥，又不卫生。垫圈要勤，一个牲口每两天垫一担土，最好是道土或叶沫草渣等，让牲口一踏，就成好肥，每两天至少能积一担肥，牲口又能健康。自研究以后，各组都回去作了动员和组织工作，现已开始干，大家的劲头很大。（连相、麦生）
    【本报长治讯】一区崔漳村牲口三十六头专管犁地，不做零活，全村茬地一千四百亩，现耕下八百三十六亩，再扩大人力三十个，大家起早搭黑刨地，在三天内即可完成。全村公粮已交清，现正准备大积肥，为明年准备很好的肥料。（良善、根云）
