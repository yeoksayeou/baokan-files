    Guerrilla Masses in Huolu
    Hemp Rope Winding Around Axles
    Sending Public Grain Under the Stars
    [Report from our newspaper in Huolu] Since October 20th, our leadership in Huolu, taking advantage of the panic among the Chiang bandit troops in Shijiazhuang, has been coordinating with armed forces to launch a second political offensive. The masses in the enemy-occupied areas are actively paying public grain to us. Wang Lulu's grandmother, a militia member from Changhe Village in the first district, said happily: "We have been looking forward to our troops coming! I am happy to grind the flour finely! I will be happy even if I am busy a hundred days and nights, just to quickly eliminate the bandit troops so we can live a good life after emancipation!" After the liberation of the Sijiazhuang in the third district on the 20th, the masses rose up to level the enemy's fortifications and carry out the struggle of distributing clothes and grain. The masses in the enemy-occupied areas rushed to pay the counter-offensive grain, saying: "We were overjoyed to hear the news of the great counter-offensive! It is time for us poor folks!" From XX Village, XX Second Village, thirty-five large carts of counter-offensive grain were delivered. The entire third district completed more than 200,000 jin. Even XX Village, which is near the railway, delivered half of its public grain. They were afraid the enemy would hear the sound of the carts, so they wrapped the axles with hemp rope! The grain deliverers said excitedly: "We have paid the counter-offensive grain!" The masses of XX Village, who delivered the grain, requested hand grenades to prepare to throw them at the enemy if they encountered them and wanted to take propaganda materials back to show their fellow villagers.

    星夜送公粮
    【本报获鹿讯】从十月二十日起，我获鹿领导方面，趁石门蒋匪恐慌之际，配合武装，展开第二次政攻，敌占区群众纷纷给我交纳公粮。一区常河村民兵王路路的奶奶高兴的说：“可盼咱们队伍来了，把面推的细细哩！忙一百黑夜我也高兴，快把匪军消灭了，可过咱的翻身好日子”。三区二十日解放寺家庄后，群众起来平毁敌人工事，进行分衣分粮斗争。敌占区群众赶交反攻粮，他们说：“听到大反攻的消息，高兴坏啦，是咱穷爷们的时候了。”××庄，××二村，交反攻粮三十五大车，全三区共完成二十多万斤，距铁路边的××庄，也送了一半公粮，他们怕敌人听见车声，用麻皮将车轴缠住！送粮的兴奋的说：“我们交了反攻粮！”××庄群众，送粮来要求给他们手榴弹，准备碰上敌人打手榴弹，并要带回宣传品给乡亲们看。（绪亭）
