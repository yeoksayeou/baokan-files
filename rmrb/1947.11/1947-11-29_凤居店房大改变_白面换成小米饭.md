　　Big Changes in Fengju Inn
  　White Flour Replaced with Millet
    [Report from Xiyang by our newspaper] Fengju Village in the Third District has now begun its winter transportation season. Cheng Suoxiao, the head of the cooperative, transported goods down the mountain once, eating two meals a day with two jin of white flour, costing a total of one thousand yuan. He was still not full, but he had to eat. After deducting expenses, there was little profit left from the transportation. Comrade Cheng Suoxiao, based on his own personal experience of the difficulties of transportation, returned to the village and discussed with the cadres and the masses to determine the transformation of the village's inns to solve the difficulties faced by poor and hired laborers in transportation. White flour was replaced with millet, with each person eating two jin per day at a cost of 360 yuan. Staying at the inn overnight costs 100 yuan per person (because of the water shortage in the village, buying a load of water costs 300 yuan). This saves one-half compared to eating white flour and ensures that guests do not face hardship. Chen Fushou's inn has already started operating in this way. Currently, all nine inns are grinding bean flour and corn flour, preparing to sell affordable meals. (Yuzhen, Mangxiao, Zhishan)

　　凤居店房大改变
  　白面换成小米饭
    【本报昔阳讯】三区凤居村，现已开始冬季运输。合作社长程所小下岭运输了一次，每天吃两顿饭二斤白面，共用一千元，还是个吃不饱，但不吃也不行。运输赚钱除了开支，所余无几。程所小同志依自己亲身体验运输的困难，回村便和干部群众研究，确定改造本村店房，解决贫雇运输困难。白面改成小米，每人每天吃二斤用三百六十元，一人住店一夜一百元（因本村水缺，买一担水三百元），这样比吃白面就能省二分之一，并且保证客人不受困难。陈福寿的店房已这样干开了。现九座店房都在磨豆面、玉茭面，筹备改卖便饭。（玉珍、忙小、志善）
