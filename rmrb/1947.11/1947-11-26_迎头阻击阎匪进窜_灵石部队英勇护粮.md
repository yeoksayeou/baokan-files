Frontal Assault to Repel the Yan Bandits’ Advance
Ling Shi Troops Heroically Protect Grain
　　【Our newspaper, Taiyue, 24th dispatch】Yan Xishan, at the end of his rope, attempted to seize grain on a large scale in Lingshi with a division of troops, but under the persistent struggle of our local armed forces and home-guarding militia, Yan Xishan's grain-grabbing plan was initially thwarted. The Lingshi County Command issued a notice on the 9th commending the meritorious troops in this battle, stating that the 28th unit persisted in the struggle in the first district, advanced to the vicinity of Dangdang Ridge to garrison, blocked the Yan bandits from advancing deep to seize grain, and heroically and stubbornly blocked a regiment of Yan bandits from advancing for two days, and also cooperated with the 29th unit to eliminate more than 30 bandits. On the 22nd of last month, the 29th unit cooperated with the second company of the backbone force in the third district to smash the Yan bandits' "encirclement and suppression" to seize grain with three regiments of troops, and killed, wounded, and captured 13 bandits. The first company of the guerrilla brigade fiercely attacked an invading battalion of Yan bandits in Suanyu and Zhuanyu areas of the second district on the 4th of this month, repelling their three assaults in succession, killing and wounding eight bandits below the platoon leader level. On the 7th, the first and second companies of the guerrilla brigade and the second district detachment again repelled the grain-grabbing activities of a battalion of the 3rd regiment of the 45th division of the bandits in the Yanjialing Shangzhuang area of the second district, killing and wounding 12 bandits. The Qi Sanyuan Workers' Team, in addition to repelling the Yan bandits' grain-grabbing team in Nanyuan on October 16, also took the initiative to go deep into the vicinity of Renjiashan, a stronghold of the Yan bandits, on the 23rd, killing and wounding 4 bandits and capturing a bandit company commander alive. On the 2nd of this month, they ambushed the Yan bandits' grain-grabbing team in Suxi Village, captured a donkey, 200 shells, and recovered more than 200 catties of grain.

【Our newspaper, Taiyue, 24th dispatch】The Lingshi combat hero Qi Sanyuan Workers' Team achieved remarkable results in the 50-day autumn protection and grain protection struggle from September 26 to the 14th of this month, totaling 7 battles, killing 18 enemies, capturing 19 enemies, wounding 5 enemies, capturing 5 small cannons, 3 machine guns, 12 rifles, and recovering 3 dan of wheat, 200 catties of millet, and 1 mule that were seized by the enemy. Under the leadership of Qi Sanyuan, the Workers' Team repeatedly won battles because they actively sought out the enemy's weaknesses to fight. Among them, famous battles included the ambush and annihilation of an enemy firepower squad in Nanwangzhong on September 24 in cooperation with the 29th unit; On October 31, he led 30 members to Renjiashan, an enemy stronghold, and immediately rushed into the village, killing 2 enemies (including a platoon leader) and capturing 3 enemies (including a village company commander), and seizing 5 rifles. On the 1st of this month, he carried out activities in the Nanyuan area, cooperating with political offensives by posting leaflets and writing slogans. When more than 10 enemies returned from Yin'nan Village from the city, they were discovered and repelled by our Sanyuan Workers' Team, and we captured a large enemy cart and a mule. On the 11th of this month, in cooperation with the 29th unit, we ambushed the enemy Yansong Village Township Office and defeated 30 enemies in 20 minutes, capturing 5 enemy grain requisition personnel alive.
