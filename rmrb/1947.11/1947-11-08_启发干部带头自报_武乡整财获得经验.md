Inspiring Cadres to Take the Lead in Self-Reporting
Wuxiang Gains Experience in Rectifying Finances

[This newspaper Wuxiang news] Wuxiang raised the issue of rectifying village finances at the county and district cadre expansion meeting in August. Recent inspections have revealed the following common problems. In old areas: when work was initiated, village cadres indiscriminately seized public grain, public funds, and property from public associations and temples. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, some cadres took the opportunity to report losses or indiscriminately seized things from the common people, as well as things confiscated from the homes of traitors. In villages where troops and organs had been stationed, there were cases of abandoned supplies or military goods that no one was managing. These problems were largely inseparable from village cadres. In new areas: materials that had been embezzled or plundered by puppet troops and puppet personnel while the enemy was present, materials that returned to the liberated areas, victory materials left by the army, and materials left in connection with puppet troops and puppet personnel were mostly connected with feudal elements, and some were linked to cadres. According to the experience of various villages: the first step is to open up the cadres' minds and mobilize them to self-report. For example, Zhao Qiansuo, Secretary of the Fourth District Committee, took the lead in self-reporting at the district cadre meeting. He said: "When I was the political director in the village, I took a blanket and seven chi of cloth from the confiscated property of a traitor. Now I want to return it to the masses as materials in the village finance." Village cadres also reported in succession, solving many problems of village cadres. They all said happily: "My own behind is clean, and I can better serve the masses. This time I am determined to do a good job in financial work when I go back." The second step is to open up the minds of the masses. The masses believe that rectifying finances has little to do with them, so first of all, the masses must realize that rectifying finances is to reduce their own burden. For example, the masses in Zhongcun calculated that the social burden (such as supporting the army, performing operas, and volunteer transportation) for half a year cost a total of 355,000 yuan, while the village's annual border defense contribution was only 80,000 yuan, exceeding it by more than four times. By enlightening the masses in this way, everyone actively participated in the rectification of finances, forming a conscious movement of everyone running the family and everyone managing the household, putting forward the slogan: "Not our own things, not a needle or thread is kept, but everything is handed over to the public." The third step is to establish a new financial path. After the rectification, the masses should discuss how to turn this dead finance into a living economy to become prosperous in production, and at the same time, there should be a system and openness for income and expenditure, so that the masses can supervise.

    启发干部带头自报
    武乡整财获得经验
    【本报武乡讯】武乡在八月县区扩干会上提出整理村财政，最近检查普遍存在着以下几个问题，在老区：开辟工作时，村干部乱抓公粮公款及公社庙等物，在抗日战争中有干部乘机报损失，或乱抓老百姓的东西，与没收汉奸家产等东西，住过军队和机关的村庄，有的放资财或军用品现无人经理的东西……。这些问题大部和村干部分不开。在新区：敌在时伪军伪人员的贪污或掠夺回解放区的物资，解放后的胜利物资与军队存放的胜利物资，及与伪军伪人员有关系存放下的东西，多半是与封建有联系，一部与干部有联带。根据各村的经验：第一关是打通干部思想，动员自报。如四区分委赵千锁，在全区干部会议上首先带头自报，他说：“我在村里当政治主任时，没收汉奸家产我拿过一块毯子七尺布，现在要给群众退出来，作为村财政里的物资。”村干部也都纷纷的自报，解决了好多村干部的问题，他们都高兴的说：“自己屁股净了，能更好的为群众服务了，这次回去有决心把财政工作做好。”第二关是打通群众思想。群众认为整理财政与自己关系不大，因此首先要使群众认识，整理财政是为了减轻自己负担。如中村群众算一下帐，半年来社会负担（如拥军、唱戏、义运等）开支共三五五○○○元，该村全年边款负担仅八○○○○元，超过四倍以上。这样启发群众，大家便积极的参加了整财。形成了大家当家大家管家的整财自觉运动，提出口号是：“不是自己东西一针一线完全交公。”第三关是树立新的财政道路。整出以后要经群众讨论，怎样把这死财政变为活经济，生产致富，同时收支要有制度和公开，以便群众监督。（武乡联合办公室）
