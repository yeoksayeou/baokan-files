　　Lincheng Masses Chop Firewood to Support the War of Resistance
　　[This newspaper's Lincheng dispatch] After completing the autumn harvest and wheat planting, the entire county, led and promoted by cadres, heroes, and activists, universally launched a firewood-chopping movement to support the war. In Beigao Village, under the slogan "Frontline soldiers fight Chiang Kai-shek, the rear masses do more to support the war," militiaman Jiang Lao Jia chopped 200 jin of firewood for the families of soldiers in half a morning. Influenced by him, all 22 militiamen launched a competition, chopping more than 1,800 jin of firewood for the families of soldiers in half a day. Women member Jiang Jin'e got up early to chop firewood in the fields, even neglecting to eat breakfast. Elementary school students Jiang Donghai and Jiang Chenghai also chopped 120 jin of firewood for the families of soldiers in half a day. The entire village chopped more than 24,000 jin of firewood for the families of soldiers in half a day. When discussing chopping firewood in Chengdong Dongshen, anti-despot committee member Yang Changchun said, "If we're talking about chopping for the families of soldiers, I dare to guarantee that I'll chop more than anyone else in our village. Even if I chop for four or five days for the families of soldiers, I'd be willing." The next day, he chopped 240 jin by himself. Deputy Village Chief Yang Donglai, despite suffering from scabies all over his body, chopped 147 jin in one day, causing his hands to swell. In one day, 202 people participated in the entire village, chopping more than 15,000 jin of firewood. Gangxi under the moonlight chopped firewood for the families of soldiers for two nights, chopping more than 2,000 jin. The city proposed "Guarantee that the families of soldiers have firewood to burn, guarantee that the families of soldiers do not go cold," and launched a village-wide firewood-chopping movement to support the war. When discussing chopping firewood for the families of soldiers in Dongbaichang, turned-over hired farm worker Liu Chengcai said, "Although I herd cattle, I will add wedges in my spare time to chop bundles of firewood for the families of soldiers, to show my heart." When chopping firewood for the families of soldiers in Haozhuang, hero Zhao Maijia chopped 192 jin in one load.
    Currently, according to statistics from 19 villages including Beigao Village, Dongxi Yageying, and Dongxinan, the entire county has chopped a total of more than 278,000 jin of firewood for the families of soldiers. (Zhenji, Baorong Zhenzhu, etc.)
