    —Editor
    The Communist Party is walking in the front,
     The Kuomintang troops ("Nationalist Army") followed behind, cleaning everything out.
     When the Red Army came, they held meetings,
     When the "Nationalist Army" arrived, they rummaged through chests and cabinets.
     They said they were eliminating harm for the people,
     Everyone knew but dared not speak out,
     Whoever spoke a word of conscience,
     Their head would be removed.

    ——编者
    前头走的是共产党，
     后面（指蒋军）跟来了一扫光，
     红军来时开大会，
     “国军”到了翻箱柜，
     他说他是为民除害，
     人人心知不敢说出来，
     谁个要讲出了良心话，
     谁人的脑壳就搬家。
