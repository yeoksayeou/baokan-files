Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th: Comprehensive news: The student anti-oppression and freedom-seeking movement in the Chiang-controlled areas, triggered by the murder of Yu Zisan, chairman of the Student Self-Government Association of Zhejiang University, by the Chiang bandits in prison, has spread from Hangzhou and Beiping to Nanjing, Shanghai, Kunming and other places. More than 20,000 teachers and students from thirty major middle schools and universities in Kunming held a general strike on the 6th and 7th, and held a rally and demonstration in Yunnan University Square, denouncing the Chiang bandits' crimes of arresting and massacring students and teachers in Kunming and other places, and demanding the immediate release of those arrested (Associated Press, Hong Kong, 9th). The Chiang bandits' heartland, the cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, also saw the outbreak of strikes and other actions over the same incident. The Student Self-Government Association of Nanjing University voted on the 9th to hold a one-day strike throughout the university, and the entire Central University also sent a telegram to the Student Self-Government Association of Zhejiang University to express condolences (Associated Press, Nanjing, 9th). On the 8th, various student organizations in Shanghai jointly protested the killing of Yu Zisan and expressed their support for the demands of teachers and students in Beiping to severely punish the murderers (United Press, Shanghai, 9th). In Beiping, university professors have issued statements supporting the student strike. Faculty members of Peking University and Tsinghua University expressed their sympathy for the students' actions, demanded that the Chiang government officials responsible for the killing of martyr Yu Zisan be severely punished, and refuted the Chiang bandits' fallacy of slandering the student strike as originating from so-called "incitement." Faculty and students of Yenching University condemned the Chiang bandits' arrest of students in Beiping, Shanghai, Hangzhou and other places as an act of destroying the law, completely violating human justice; and pointed out that this kind of atrocity by the Chiang bandits has made the people of the world more clearly recognize the true face of the Chiang family bandit gang. All foreign professors at Yenching University signed the statement (United Press, Beiping, 8th).

According to a report by the Associated Press, Nanjing, 9th: The rising tide of student anti-oppression and freedom-seeking movements in various places has made the Chiang family bandit gang feel as if they are sitting on pins and needles. Chiang Kai-shek hastily convened a meeting in Nanjing on the 9th to "instruct the control of the student movement." Chen Xueping, the head of the Chiang Party's youth ministry and special agent, issued a statement after the meeting, threatening the student movements that are rising up in various places with "dissolving the schools." It is generally believed that the surging of this just student anti-oppression and freedom-seeking movement in the Chiang area is a direct result of the Chiang bandits' dismissal of students, dismissal of professors, and massive arrests and massacres of students in various places since the summer vacation; no intimidation, fraud, or suppression can prevent the students' just resistance.

　　昆明两万师生示威  京沪学潮冲击蒋匪心脏
    【新华社陕北十日电】综合消息：以浙大学生自治会主席于子三被蒋匪在狱中杀害为导火线的蒋管区学生反压迫争自由运动，已由杭州、北平扩至南京、上海、昆明等各地。昆明三十个大中学师生两万余人，于六、七两日举行总罢课，并在云南大学广场集会示威，声讨蒋匪在昆明及各地逮捕屠杀学生教员罪行，要求立即释放被捕者（美联社香港九日电）。蒋匪心脏区域京、沪两地，亦为同一事件爆发罢课等行动。南京金陵大学学生自治会于九日投票决定全校罢课一天，中央大学全校亦致电浙大学生自治会志哀（美联社南京九日电）。上海各学生团体八日联名抗议于子三被杀，并表示支持北平各校师生严惩凶手等要求（合众社沪九日讯）。北平方面各大学教授纷纷发表声明，支持学生罢课行动。北大、清华两校教职员声明中表示同情学生行动，要求严惩杀害于子三烈士的蒋政府负责官员，并驳斥蒋匪诬蔑学生罢课起源于所谓“受煽动”之谬论。燕大师生声明中，谴责蒋匪在北平、上海、杭州等地逮捕学生系毁法行为，完全违反人类正义；并指出蒋匪此种暴行，已使世界人民更认清楚了蒋家匪帮的真面目。燕大全体外籍教授均署名于此声明中（合众社北平八日讯）。
    另据美联社南京九日电透露：各地学生反压迫争自由运动的日益高涨，使蒋家匪帮如坐针毡。蒋介石曾于九日在南京慌忙召集会议，“训令控制学生运动。”蒋党青年部长特务头子陈雪屏于会后发出谈话，以“解散学校”威胁各地风起云涌的学生运动。一般认为此次蒋区学生反压迫争自由正义运动的汹涌澎湃，即系蒋匪自暑假以来在各地革退学生、解聘教授，大举逮捕屠杀学生的直接结果；任何恐吓、欺诈与镇压决不能阻遏学生的正义的反抗。
