Currently, hundreds of thousands of working people are serving the war day and night at our army's front lines and in the rear. Their tasks mainly involve carrying and caring for the wounded, transporting grain for the army, handling the rearward transport of spoils of war and the forward transport of military supplies, and undertaking transportation tasks for various logistics departments and local work agencies. Such a volunteer labor force composed of working people is the first of its kind in Chinese history. Their enthusiasm for labor service, the depth of their political awareness, and the arduousness of their work process, enduring wind and dew, laboring day and night, and fighting against American and Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft and artillery fire are remarkable. Their highly responsible spirit in cherishing the wounded and protecting public property has ensured the completion of difficult tasks. The organization and command of hundreds of thousands of working people is gradually forming a system and order. This is a vast and profound organizational science, a great manifestation of the high political awareness and organizational genius of the Chinese working people under the leadership of our Party, and one of the powerful factors that enable our army to maintain its glorious record of constant victory. Without this great volunteer transportation army of working people, we cannot even dream of winning the war. An American reporter traveling in the Shandong Liberated Area was deeply astonished by the transportation ranks of the working people serving the front lines. He believed that in European and American countries, even if such a phenomenon existed, it would require military escorts and official supervision, or at least huge rewards. Otherwise, it would be difficult to guarantee that the people pushing and transporting so many important daily necessities and military supplies would not damage, steal, or privately take them for their own use. As for other countries or Kuomintang China, the reporter witnessed that it would be impossible to form such a large transportation team without highly coercive orders and exhaustive methods of enslavement. Moreover, such a transportation team would not be sustainable; large-scale desertions, large-scale escapes from duty, large-scale escapes, and large-scale damage, theft, and corruption would be inevitable. Only the phenomenon in the Chinese Liberated Area is very peculiar. Such a strong transportation team of hundreds of thousands of people has no military escort, and everywhere is piled and transported with major war materials and daily necessities. Thirdly, they move at night to prevent air raids. Fourthly, they work hard and risk the threat of Kuomintang aircraft and artillery fire. According to the investigation, there is no phenomenon of large-scale escape or theft, and everyone demonstrates a noble spirit of voluntary labor service. The reporter finally believed that this is the great success of the democratic movement of the people in the Liberated Area and a miracle created by breaking through history. I think this American reporter's assessment and comments are correct. The great patriotic self-defense war currently being waged can only be correctly understood from the justice of the people's cause and the self-consciousness of the military and civilians in the Liberated Area in serving the war. Therefore, this war cannot be overcome by American imperialism and its running dogs, and the inevitability of victory is even more predictable.

Various new things have emerged in the self-defense war over the past year, and the broad masses of people have made various new creations. The people's transportation work is only one of the great events among them. The work and creations in all aspects need to be summarized. Here, I would like to put forward eight opinions on the issue of organizing and leading the working people to carry out transportation, as a reference for summarizing the work and carrying out the transportation issue. I do not intend to talk about the overall problem; I will only talk about a few key points:

First, the issue of changing titles. A comrade suggested in a letter to change the title of "minfu" (civilian porter). He said that "minfu" is a contemptuous old term for the ruling class's enslavement of the people, which is incompatible with the new content of our working people's free labor in serving the front lines, and should be considered for change. In fact, many "minfu" comrades are reluctant to bear this old title. For example, some comrades call them "minfu" comrades or "fuzi" (master) comrades. They immediately replied: "I volunteered to go to the front line to serve the war, not forced to be a 'fuzi'. A revolutionary comrade is a revolutionary comrade. I don't listen to your 'fu' or 'qi' (wife)." The comrade also suggested changing the name to "mingong" (civilian worker), which does not contradict the facts. I fully agree with this change. I remember in the Jiangxi era, the local people hated the army calling them "laobiao, laobiao" (old cousin) or "laobaixing" (common people). Now, according to what I have personally heard and seen, the people of Shandong also hate others calling them "laoxiang, laoxiang" (fellow villager). Everyone is very happy to be addressed as "comrade." I think our army has always adopted a comradely, close, and friendly attitude towards the people, so changing "minfu" to "mingong" and changing the address to the local people to "comrade" is correct. The army's adoption of a comradely, family-like attitude towards the people is a manifestation of our army's tradition and true color. This is different from the anti-people army's crude and barbaric attitude of oppressors and rulers towards the people. I propose that this change be taken as a more practical step to strengthen the connection between the army and the people. We should carry out more specific work to combine with the people in light of reality, and pay attention to the importance of the work in the midst of the hundreds of thousands of "mingong" comrades fighting alongside the troops.

Second, the organization and leadership of the "mingong". There should be two kinds of care for the "mingong" comrades: first, political; second, material in daily life; third, a combination of the two. The hundreds of thousands of "mingong" comrades, after eight years of the War of Resistance and the "double reduction" and land reform, have a high level of political awareness. When they go to the front line to serve, they are most concerned about the war situation and receiving tasks. When they arrive at the troops, they are welcomed by the entire unit. This kind of political get-together first satisfies the "mingong" comrades spiritually, so all work proceeds smoothly. A certain unit initially only paid attention to their daily life care, thinking that these "fuzi" were not brave enough, could not endure hardship, and the common people did not understand anything, adopting a "summon when needed, dismiss when not" attitude. Although the daily life care was very good, the result was very disharmonious, and the work was difficult to promote. On the contrary, a certain unit only used some empty propaganda and did not take care of the difficulties of joining the war for the first time, causing illness and damage, which is very distressing. Therefore, our specific experience in organizing and leading "mingong" is to combine political education and daily life care. Not only should we care about the daily life of the "mingong" comrades in many ways, such as ensuring they have enough to eat, have houses to live in, and receive medical treatment when sick, but also recognize that putting hundreds of thousands of "mingong" comrades on the front line is equivalent to entering a school of people's war. The success of this education not only lies in strongly supporting the current war, but also in influencing the people's construction decades later, which can be asserted. This basic line should be determined. According to the materials I know: 1. The speeches of the "mingong" comrades can best touch the feelings of the liberated soldiers who came from the Kuomintang army. When the troops rush to the battlefield, thousands of "mingong" follow. Seeing this scene, many excitedly said to the old soldiers: "We used to go to a place and the people would run away. You have so many people helping you everywhere. No wonder you win battles, no wonder we are caught as soon as we fight." The newly liberated soldiers were injured, and the "mingong" carried them down, served tea and rice, and asked about their well-being. The wounded said with emotion: "You saved my life, you are my benefactor." The "mingong" said: "How am I your benefactor? You were wounded in battle and defeated the reactionaries. You saved my life, you are really my great benefactor." This naturally links the class feelings of the military and civilians together, which can most quickly improve the awareness of the liberated soldiers, deeply understand the glorious essence of participating in the people's army to fight for the interests of the people, deeply recognize the power of the people and further increase their confidence in victory, and quickly promote their transition to the people's side. 2. The "mingong" comrades' love for the wounded. They have five people caring for one stretcher. The stretcher team serving in the "Wuchang" unit in Jiaodong carried out a special movement to care for the wounded, and carried out in-depth education on serving the wounded, putting forward the slogan "stretcher bearers at night, nurses during the day," and advocating the "five fasts": "fast assembly, fast eating, fast sleeping, fast walking, fast transfer." They took the achievement of caring for the wounded as the first item of merit. They bought eggs three times for the wounded, carefully took care of the wounded's bowel movements, hid the wounded first when encountering an airplane, carried them flat, put them down gently, always cared about reducing the pain of the wounded, asked the doctor before giving the wounded something to eat, did not talk much to the wounded who could not speak, and talked about national affairs instead of family matters to those who could speak. This meticulous care for the wounded can best give the wounded comrades spiritual comfort and material care. This is the best creation, solving the various difficult problems of the wounded comrades during the transfer period and alleviating the inadequacy of medical care. 3. The "mingong" comrades return to the rear after serving on the front line, their awareness is further improved, they are more knowledgeable and have a broader vision, and they often become the most powerful supporters and organizers of the war in their villages and towns, and the most active participants and backbones in land reform review and production. Through them, the war power is organized more magnificently. 4. Many "mingong" comrades, due to their short-term service on the front line, have discovered research and creation of specialized businesses such as rescuing materials, carrying the wounded, and transporting grain. They have invented many methods that are both economical and reasonable. For example, they transport when there is a transportation task, and carry out resident political work when there is no task, and incidentally help the residents with production, such as harvesting, without wasting work time, which is commendable. Our army commanders and Communists should learn from them and work with the "mingong" comrades to carry out special business research on "mingong" supporting the front line. I think the greatest achievements and valuable experiences are waiting for us. Therefore, for the army's stretchers, the standing "mingong" stretchers, the temporary people's stretchers mobilized on the spot, and the army's "mingong" vehicle transportation team and "mingong" cart team, it is required to consolidate them practically according to the prescribed number. After the battle is over, the training of the "mingong" transportation team should be planned as one of the troop training projects, and experience should be summarized and all difficult problems should be solved.

Third, regarding the issue of "mingong" comrades volunteering to join the army, they should all be sent back to their hometowns after their service period is over in accordance with government regulations, and no exceptions should be made to mobilize them. In fact, after the "mingong" comrades return home, they take the lead in joining the army, which has a greater and better effect than enlisting them immediately in the army.

Fourth, the issue of the political and material treatment of the "mingong" comrades. A merit-making movement should be carried out among the "mingong" comrades, and systematic mobilization and organizational work should be carried out according to the characteristics of the "mingong" comrades' composition. The appearance of a large number of "mingong" heroes will surely strengthen the integration of the military and the people. The material treatment of the "mingong" comrades. The "mingong" team accompanying the army should enjoy the same treatment as the comrades in the army, and the short-term standing "mingong" team should be satisfied with their due needs.

Fifth, promote the movement of mutual love between the troops and the "mingong". The movement to care for the wounded in the "mingong" team is unfolding, and the troops should also further care for the "mingong" team, and should regard the "mingong" team as a component of the troops. It is a powerful combat combination. Whether it is marching, fighting, or during training, it should be included in the military work and political work projects. In addition to properly taking care of them in life, the "mingong" team and the troops should participate in meetings with each other, report their work to each other, and take care of each other as much as possible. The spoils of war should be appropriately distributed to the "mingong" comrades. In an emergency during combat, if the soldiers are injured and the "mingong" comrades bravely pick up weapons and join the battle, they should be approved immediately, but should be specially directed and care for their wounded to reduce casualties, so as to show the troops' special concern for the "mingong" comrades, etc.

Sixth, oppose the arbitrary use of "mingong" and the waste of "mingong". In the early days of the self-defense war, individual units of our army had developed to an extremely serious extent in this regard. After several periods of recuperation, there has been a gradual transition to the right track. Individual phenomena of wasting manpower still need to be overcome. Although the power of the people is abundant and infinite, it must be used in a controlled manner in order to continuously supply the war for a long time. Otherwise, there is a danger of exhaustion. Now many troops have paid attention to calculating the limits of using manpower, not asking for too much, not abusing it, appropriately distributing tasks, using it scientifically and in an organized manner, and giving them opportunities to recuperate in a timely manner, which is very good; but it should be further promoted for the troops to labor themselves, and everything that can be done without using "mingong" should be solved by relying on their own labor as much as possible. The more we labor ourselves, the more we reduce the waste of manpower. Helping the masses with labor is an excellent tradition of our army, and it must be done universally. Saving manpower and cultivating manpower in all aspects is not only enough to strengthen the close relationship between the military and the people, but also necessary to continuously increase war power and defeat the enemy.

We are waging a great war in Chinese history that has never been seen before, fighting against enemies equipped with modern equipment. The countryside we rely on has a decentralized economy and backward transportation. Being able to overcome difficulties and defeat the enemy basically relies on the progressive people plus the Party's scientific leadership. Therefore, all the crude and backward tools are mastered by the broad masses of people, so that under the control of the high wisdom of the broad masses of people, they can create achievements beyond the expectations of ordinary people. The people in the Liberated Area, the "mingong" team serving the front line, solving difficult transportation problems, and supporting the war to win victory, is it not actually the slow speed of the great "mingong" transportation team defeating the modern speed of American aircraft, automobiles, sea ships and trains relied on by the Kuomintang? Therefore, we should more deeply realize and comprehend that firmly and practically relying on the great progressive people, scientifically turning and enlightening the progressive minds of hundreds of millions of people, and creating new wisdom, have already defeated one Japanese imperialism and Wang Jingwei, and it is no problem to defeat another American imperialism plus Chiang Kai-shek. The creation of the great "mingong" transportation team is only one of the new things in the war in the Liberated Area. We can also list the following items, such as the creation of the great military art of annihilating the anti-people army; for example, the political transformation work of striving for hundreds of thousands of former Kuomintang soldiers to join the people's army; for example, the combination of the merit-making movement and the heroic model movement of hundreds of thousands of field armies; for example, the great land reform of more than 100 million people in the Liberated Area; for example, the combination of the great wartime finance and economy and the people's production; also, the great military-civilian unity and mutual love in the Liberated Area; and the great struggle to persist in guerrilla warfare and protect the interests of the people in the Chiang-occupied areas and the great people's democratic movement in the Chiang-controlled areas. These new creations are all new creations under the new patriotic self-defense war faced after defeating the Japanese invaders. Therefore, relying on backward tools and backward material conditions, relying on the progressive people, and relying on the Party's scientific leadership are sufficient to defeat modern enemies. And with the wisdom and creation of the progressive people as a lever, every aspect is worthy of careful study and careful summary, in order to seek greater and more improvement. This is the victorious road that the great Chinese people have personally made, personally opened up, and made themselves liberated.

    如何爱护组织民工
    陈毅将军在华东人民解放军干部会上报告的一段
    目前在我军前线和后方日夜有数十万劳动人民替战争服务，他们的任务主要是抬运和救护伤员，替军队运送粮食，担任战利品的后运和军用品的前运，同时还要替各后勤部门各地方工作机关进行输送工作。这样一支由劳动人民组成的志愿劳动大军，在中国历史上还是第一次出现，其劳动服务的热忱，其政治觉悟的深刻，其工作过程的辛苦，风餐露饮，日夜勤劳，还要与美蒋飞机炮火进行搏斗。他们爱护伤员爱护公物的高度负责的精神，保证了繁难任务的完成。数十万劳动人民的组织和指挥逐渐形成系统和秩序，这是一门巨大精深的组织科学，这是在我党领导下中国劳动人民高度的政治觉悟与组织天才的伟大表现，这是我军能保持常胜光荣成绩的有力因素之一。没有这一支伟大劳动人民志愿运输大军，我们休想战争能够胜利。一个美国记者游历山东解放区，看着劳动人民服务前线的运输行列，深为诧异。他认为在欧美各国纵令有此现象，也必须军队押解和官吏监督，至少应有巨大报酬才行，否则人民推运着这许多重要的日用品和军用物资，是难以保障不被损伤和盗窃或私自取用的。至于在其他各国或国民党中国，据该记者亲眼看见，则更非高度强迫命令，用尽奴役办法不可能组成这样大的运输队，而且这种运输队，是不可能持久的，大批开小差，大批逃差，大批逃亡，大批损坏盗窃贪污是难免的必然现象；只有在中国解放区的现象非常奇特，这样强大的数十万人民运输队伍，一无军队押解，二是到处堆着和运送着主要战争物资和生活必需品，三是为了防空而夜间运动，四是劳动辛勤还要冒着国民党飞机炮火的威胁，据调查并无成批逃亡和盗窃的现象，人人表现了志愿的劳动服务的高贵精神。该记者最后认为这是解放区人民的民主运动的伟大成功，是突破历史所创造的奇迹。我想这个美国记者的估计和评论是正确的。目前所进行的伟大爱国自卫战争，只有从人民事业的正义性和解放区军民服务战争的自觉性，才能获得正确了解。因而这个战争是美国帝国主义及其走狗所不能克服它的，胜利的必然性更可预见得到的。
    一年来的自卫战争出现了各种新事物，广大人民有了各种新的创造，人民运输工作仅是其中的伟大事件之一。各方面的工作和创造需要加以总结，我在此特就手边关于组织和领导劳动人民进行运输问题提出八项意见，作总结工作与进行运输问题提出八项意见，作总结工作与进行工作的参考。我不企图讲到全般的问题，我只讲其中几个要点：
    第一是改变称号问题。某同志来信中提议改变民夫的称号，他说民夫是统治阶级奴役人民的一种轻贱的旧称呼，与我们劳动人民服务前线的自由劳动的新内容大不相称，应考虑改变。事实上有不少民夫同志讨厌承受这一旧称呼，例如有同志叫民夫同志，或夫子同志。他们即回答：“我自愿上前线替战争服务，不是强迫来当夫子的，革命同志就是革命同志，俺不听你夫呀妻呀的。”某同志又提议改称民工，各实才不矛盾，我完全同意这样改称。记得在江西时代，当地人民最讨厌军队喊“老表，老表”或喊“老百姓”，现在据我个人耳闻目见，山东人民亦讨厌别人喊“老乡，老乡”，大家以同志相称则十分喜欢。我想我军对人民自来采取同志的至亲的友爱态度，则民夫改称民工，对当地人民一律以同志改称这是对的。军队对人民采取同志的自家人的态度，这本是我军的传统和本色的表现。这与反人民军队对人民采取压迫者统治者的粗暴野蛮的态度是两样的。我提议把这改称作为加强军队与人民联系的更实际的步骤。我们应针对实际进行更多的结合人民的具体工作，应注意到数十万民工同志与部队一起并肩作战，这中间工作的重要性应引起充分注意。
    第二是民工的组织与领导问题。对民工同志应有两种照顾：第一种是政治的，第二种是生活物质的，第三是两者的结合。数十万民工同志们，他们经过八年抗战，经过双减和土地改革，他们的政治觉悟很高，他们到前线服务，第一关心的是战争情况，和受领任务，到部队受到部队全体的欢迎，这种政治联欢，首先使民工同志们精神上得到满足，因此一切工作便顺利进行。某部队在初期仅注意到对他们的生活照顾，以为这一些夫子胆子不壮，受不得苦，老百姓不懂得什么，采取“招之则来，挥之则去”的态度，虽生活照顾很好，结果很不融洽，工作推行很难。反之，某一部队仅仅用一些空洞的宣传，不照顾初次加入战争的困难，造成疾病和损害，是令人很痛心的。因此我们对组织民工和领导民工的具体经验，是政治教育与生活照顾两相结合，不仅要多方关心民工同志的日常生活，如饭要吃饱，有房子住，疾病要医治等。还要认识把数十万民工同志服务前线等于进入人民战争的学校，这种教育的成绩不仅在于有力支援了目前的战争，而且更要影响到数十年后的人民建设，是可以断言的，这一基本路线应确定下来。据我所知道的材料指出：一、民工同志们的讲话最能打动从国民党军队过来的解放战士同志们的感情。部队奔赴战场，成千成万民工跟着行进，他们看到这种情景，许多兴奋得朝着老战士说：“我们从前到一处老百姓便跑光，你们到处有这许多老百姓帮忙，难怪你们打胜仗，怪不得我们一打仗便被抓过来。”新解放战士受了伤，民工同志抬下来，端茶送饭，问暖嘘寒，伤员感动的说：“你救了我的命了，你是我的恩人。”民工同志说：“怎样我是你的恩人，你打仗负了伤，打垮反动派，你救了我的命了，你真是我的大恩人。”这样使军民的阶级的感情很自然的联在一起，这最能迅速提高解放战士的觉悟，深切了解参加人民军队为人民利益作战的光荣本质，深切认识人民力量而更加提高胜利信心，迅速促进其转到人民方面。二、民工同志们对伤员的爱护，他们一付担架五个人招护。胶东在“武昌”部队服务的担架队，专门进行了爱护伤员运动，曾经深入的进行了为伤员服务的教育，提出“晚上担架员，白天看护员”的口号，提倡五快运动：“集合快，吃饭快，睡觉快，走路快，转送快”。他们以爱护伤员的成绩作为立功的第一项，他们买了三次鸡蛋给伤员吃，专心的照拂伤员大小便，遇到飞机，先把伤员隐蔽好，抬时要平，放下要轻，总是关心减少伤员痛苦，给伤员东西吃，先问医生，伤员不能讲话的不多讲，能讲的不谈家常而谈国家大事，这种无微不至的爱护伤员，最能给伤员同志们以精神安慰和物质照顾。这是最好的创造，解决了转运期间伤员同志的各种繁难问题，解救了医务救护的不足。三、民工同志们从前线服务期满回到后方，他们觉悟又提高一步，见多识广眼界开阔，在其本村本乡每每成为该地的最有力的战争支持者和组织者，成为土改复查和生产最积极的参加者和骨干，经过他们，更把战争力量更雄伟的组织起来了。四、许多民工同志们由于短期在前线服务，经过他们的头脑，目前已发现了对救护物资、搬运伤员、运输粮食等专门业务的研究和创造，他们发明出许多既节省又合理的办法，例如有运输任务则担任运输，无任务则进行居民政治工作，并附带帮助居民生产，如收割等工作，不浪费工作时间，是值得称赞的。我军指挥员和共产党员应向他们学习，切实协同民工同志们去作民工支援前线的专门业务研究，我想最大的成绩和宝贵的经验，是在等着我们的。因此对部队担架，对常备的民工担架，对临时就地动员的人民担架，对部队的民工车辆运输队民工大车队，都要求按照规定的数目加以切实巩固，战斗结束应计划民工运输队的整训，作为部队整训项目之一，切实总结经验，解决一切繁难问题。
    第三，是对民工同志们志愿参军问题，一律依照政府规定，服务期满即欢送回籍，不得破例动员。事实上民工同志回家以后，他们带头参军比在部队中即行入伍作用更大更好。
    第四、是民工同志的政治待遇、物质待遇问题，应在民工同志们中进行立功运动，应按照民工同志组成的特点进行系统的动员和组织工作，大批民工英雄之出现必更能加强军民之结合。民工同志的物质待遇，其随军民工队应与部队同志享受相等的待遇，短期常备民工队则斟酌满足其应有的需要。
    第五、是提倡部队与民工的互爱运动，民工队中爱护伤员的运动正在展开，部队同样要进一步爱护民工队，应把民工队视为部队的组成部分。他是有力的战斗结合，无论行军作战或整训期间，均应列入军事工作和政治工作的项目之内，除生活上必须妥为照顾之外，应就可能，民工队和部队进行互相参加会议，和互相会报工作，互相照顾，战利品应适当配给民工同志，战斗紧急时，战士负伤，民工同志奋勇拾起武器加入战斗，应即批准，但应特别加以指挥，关心其伤员，以减少伤亡，以表现部队对民工同志的特别关切等。
    第六、是反对任意使用民工和浪费民工，自卫战争初期，我个别部队内曾在这方面发展到极其严重的程度，经过几期休整，已有转变逐渐走上轨道，个别浪费民力现象仍须加以克服，人民力量虽是丰厚无穷的，但必须有节制的使用，才能源源不断，长期供应战争，否则，便有枯竭危险。现在已有不少部队注意到具体计算使用民力的限度，不多要，不滥用，适当分配任务，科学的有组织的使用，并适时于以休整机会，这是很好的；但还应进一步提倡部队自己劳动，一切可能不用民工的，尽量依靠自己劳动解决。我们自己多劳动一分，即减少浪费一分民力，帮助群众劳动更是我军的优良传统，要普遍做，从各方面节约民力，培植民力，不仅足以亲密军民关系，也是不断增长战争力量，战胜敌人所必需的。
    我们正进行着中国历史上互古未有的大战争，面对着具备现代装备的敌人作战，我们所依托的农村，其经济是分散的，交通是落后的，能够克服困难，战胜敌人，基本上是依靠进步的人民加上党的科学的领导，因而一切粗笨的落后的工具，为广大人民所掌握，这样在广大人民的高度智慧的控制下，便能创造出平常人意料的成绩。解放区人民民工队服务前线，解决繁难运输问题，支持战争获得胜利，实际不就是伟大民工运输队的缓慢速度，打败了国民党所依靠的美式飞机、汽车、海船和火车的现代速度吗？因此我们应该更深刻觉悟到和领会到坚决的实际的依靠伟大的进步的人民，科学的转动和启发千百万人民的进步头脑，创造新的智慧，已经打败了一个日本帝国主义和汪精卫，再打败一个美国帝国主义加上蒋介石是不成问题的。伟大民工运输队的创造，只是解放区战争的新事物之一，我们还可以列举下列各项，例如对反人民军队进行歼灭战的伟大军事艺术的创造问题；例如争取数十万过去是国民党兵士加入人民军队作战的政治改造工作问题；例如数十万野战军的立功运动与英模运动相结合问题；例如解放区一万万以上的人民的伟大土地改革问题；例如伟大的战时财政经济和人民生产的结合问题；又如解放区伟大的军民团结互爱问题；又如蒋后区坚持游击战争保护人民利益的伟大斗争和蒋管区伟大的人民民主运动，这些新的创造，均是在击败日寇以后又面临新的爱国自卫战争下新的创造。因此依靠落后的工具和落后的物质条件，依靠进步的人民依靠党的科学领导，便足以战胜现代化的敌人。而以进步的人民的智慧和创造为杠杆，每一方面均值得细心研究，细心总结，求得更大更多的提高。这就是伟大的中国人民所亲手做出所亲自开辟而使自己获得解放的胜利道路。
