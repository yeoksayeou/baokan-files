Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th. Jiang bandit administrative president and head of the Political Science Clique, Zhang Qun, who flew to Taiwan on the 24th for "inspection," flew back to Nanjing on the 28th. Zhang "inspected" Kaohsiung, Keelung, Taipei, Tainan, Pingtung, and other military bases in Taiwan that had been sold by Jiang bandits to the United States, urging the acceleration of the construction of these bases for the use of their American masters. It is said that "the current throughput of Kaohsiung Port has reached 800,000 tons, and a pier is being planned and constructed to accommodate 32 large ships of 20,000 tons simultaneously, and the warehouse storage capacity has reached 170,000 tons." Zhang Qun also strongly promoted "increasing the production of Taiwan's industrial and mining enterprises and encouraging export sales" to meet the needs of raw materials for the United States and Japan. Taiwan's salt production, which has become an important industrial raw material for Japan, is advocated by Zhang to be handled by the newly established bureaucratic combination of the four major families, the "China Salt Industry Co., Ltd." In Kaohsiung, "special funds are allocated to build a salt transportation pier" so that Taiwan salt "can be transshipped through Kaohsiung." Zhang "inspected" the Kaohsiung refinery, which belongs to the "China Petroleum Corporation," a petroleum trust of the four major families, and the petroleum company is controlled by American capital and technology. All facts show that Zhang Qun's trip to Taiwan was mainly to accelerate the colonization of Taiwan in military and economic aspects to repay his American masters for their recent "loan" "grace." Zhang openly declared at the "Anniversary of Taiwan's Restoration" meeting in Taiwan: "The Japanese rule has established a legal foundation for Taiwan, and it is easy to implement democratic politics correctly." This clearly shows that the so-called "democratic politics" implemented by the Jiang family bandit gang in Taiwan is nothing but a naked continuation of Japanese enslavement rule. While Zhang Qun was in Taiwan, his Political Science Clique colleagues Jiang bandit Resources Committee Chairman Weng Wenhao, Executive Yuan Political Affairs Committee Member Peng Xuepei, National Government Committee Member Miao Yuntai, who was close to the Political Science Clique, and Jiang bandit Northwest Headquarters Director Zhang Zhizhong were also in Taiwan for "inspection."

    张群赴台督建美军基地
    台湾加速殖民地化
    【新华社陕北三十日电】二十四日飞往台湾“视察”之蒋匪行政院长政学系头子张群已于二十八日飞返南京。张在台曾“视察”高雄，基隆，台北，台南，屏东等已由蒋匪出卖与美国之军事基地，督促加速此等基地之建筑，以供其美国主子使用。据称“高雄港目前吞吐量已达八十万吨，正计划疏建码头，俾可停泊二万吨大轮，同时停泊三十二艘，仓库储量亦达十七万吨”。张群并力促“使台湾工矿事业增加生产，鼓励出口外销”，以便供应美日原料之需要，目前已成日本重要工业原料之台湾盐产，张则主张由新近成立之四大家族官僚组合“中国盐业股份有限公司”。在高雄“拨款专建运盐码头”，以便台盐“悉经高雄转口”。张曾“视察”高雄炼油厂，该厂为四大家族石油托辣斯“中国石油公司”所属，而该石油公司又为美国资金与技术所控制。各项事实显示，张群此次到台主要系在军事及经济方面加速台湾之殖民地化，以报答其美国主子最近“贷款”之“恩典”。张在台“光复周年纪念”大会中曾公开宣称：“日本统治时期已为台湾确立法治基础，进一步实行民主政治，易于正确”。此清楚说明蒋家匪帮在台湾所实行之所谓“民主政治”，不过为日本奴役统治赤裸裸之继续。张群在台时，其政学系同僚蒋匪资委会委员长翁文灏，行政院政务委员彭学沛，接近政学系之国府委员缪云台及蒋匪西北行辕主任张治中等，亦同在台“视察”。
