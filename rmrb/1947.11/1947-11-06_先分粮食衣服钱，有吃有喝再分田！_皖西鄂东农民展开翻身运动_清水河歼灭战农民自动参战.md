    Xinhua News Agency, Hubei-Henan-Anhui Front, 4th: The people's emancipation movement is vigorously unfolding in various parts of western Anhui and eastern Hubei. 1. Western Anhui: In counties such as Lu'an, Huoshan, Shucheng, Yuexi, Tongcheng, Huxi (newly established county west of Chao Lake), Qianshan, and Taihu, the struggle to distribute grain and floating wealth has begun. The peasant emancipation movement in Yuexi, Huoshan, Shucheng, Lu'an and other places has become popular throughout the counties. Each time, up to thousands of people participate in the struggle, and poor peasant groups and peasant representative conferences are successively established. The peasants are in high spirits and automatically put forward slogans such as "First distribute grain, clothing, and money, ensuring food and drink before dividing the land." Landlords and local tyrants once attempted to buy off some activists and threatened them with "the changing of the heavens," but the peasants replied, "When the enemy comes, we will go to the mountains with the Eighth Route Army," crushing the schemes and deceptions of the local tyrants. After the great victory in the Battle of Zhangjiadian in Huoshan, the masses went in groups to distribute the grain of the local tyrants as soon as the battle ended. Villages far away from the democratic government also automatically sent people to the democratic government to ask for solutions. 2. Eastern Hubei: In the areas of Mudianzi, Saohujia, Taiziwan, and Sijishan in Macheng, after the peasants distributed the floating wealth, they automatically discussed the method of land distribution. They quickly distributed the land to poor peasants, and then organized farmers' associations. After the peasants got the land, they held banquets to celebrate, and immediately demanded to organize armed forces to arrest Chiang Kai-shek's puppet township chiefs and bailiffs, and volunteered to help distribute grain and land outside the villages. The peasants' slogan is: "The Communist Party shows us the way, but we still have to rely on ourselves to walk it!"
    Xinhua News Agency, Hubei-Henan-Anhui Front, 4th: In the battle of Qing Shui River, which annihilated Chiang Kai-shek's 40th Division, more than 2,000 local peasants who were undergoing land reform voluntarily participated in the battle to carry the wounded and act as guides. Although the casualties of the People's Liberation Army were very small in this battle, the mountains were heavy and the roads were rugged, and without the help of the local people, there would have been many difficulties. On the evening of the 27th, not long after the battle ended, a group of more than ten reporters encountered a group of peasants carrying stretchers on a steep mountain ridge, led by only one soldier. We helped them climb and expressed our condolences. But they said, "Everyone is working for the country, and you are working harder than us in the war." The People's Liberation Army stipulated that everyone would be paid 5,000 Chiang Kai-shek yuan per day and provided with food, and that grain and rice would be distributed according to the distance traveled when they returned, but the masses were very modest and declined. A peasant named Zhang in a village near Qingshui River volunteered to be a guide on the evening of the 26th, running back and forth as many as seven times, and refused to go home. The last time he led the medical staff to the front line, he was shot by Chiang Kai-shek's machine gun and wounded in five places. The People's Liberation Army immediately carried him to the health station. When passing by his house, his mother and wife cried bitterly, and he comforted them, saying: "This is for my own sake, a little injury doesn't matter." The floating wealth of the landlord had just been distributed in their village, and the peasants in the whole village were very excited and rushed to express their condolences to the wounded peasant and his family.

    先分粮食衣服钱，有吃有喝再分田！
    皖西鄂东农民展开翻身运动
    清水河歼灭战农民自动参战
    【新华社鄂豫皖前线四日电】皖西鄂东各地人民翻身运动正猛烈展开。一、皖西方面：六安、霍山、舒城、岳西、桐城、湖西（巢潮西新设县）、潜山、太湖等县，均已开始分粮分浮财的斗争。岳西、霍山、舒城、六安等地农民翻身运动已普及全县。每次参加斗争者多至数千人，贫农小组与农民代表大会相继成立；农民情绪极高，自动提出：“先分粮食衣服钱，有吃有喝再分田”等口号。地主土豪曾企图收买一部分积极分子，并以“变天”相威胁，但农民回答说：“敌人来，跟八路军上山”，粉碎了土豪们的阴谋欺骗。在霍山张家店战斗大胜后，群众于战斗刚告结束，即成群结队去分土豪的粮食。离民主政府较远的村庄，也自动派人来民主政府问办法。二、鄂东地区：麻城木店子、扫湖家、台子湾、四基山一带，农民分浮财后，即自动讨论分田办法。迅速将田地分给贫苦农民，接着组织农会。农民得田后，纷纷办酒请客庆贺，并即要求组织武装捉拿蒋伪乡保长，纷纷自动到村外帮助分粮分田。农民的口号是：“共产党给我们指路，走路还得靠自己！”
    【新华社鄂豫皖前线四日电】清水河歼灭蒋匪四十师之役，当地正在进行土地改革的两千余农民自动参战抬运伤兵及当向导。此役解放军虽伤亡数目甚小，但万山重叠，道路崎岖，如无当地人民帮助，困难殊多。二十七日晚战斗刚结束不久，在一条险峻的山岭上，记者等一行十余人在险坡处遇着一批农民抬着担架，仅有一个战士领队，当帮助他们攀登，并致慰问。但他们说：“大家都是为国出力，你们打仗比我们更辛苦。”解放军规定每人抬一天酬劳蒋币五千元，并供给伙食，回去时按路程发给粮米，但群众却十分谦让推辞。清水河附近某村有位姓张的农民，二十六日晚自动要求当向导，来回跑了七次之多，始终不肯回家。最后一次带领卫生员上火线，为蒋匪机关枪扫射，负伤五处。解放军立即把他抬到卫生所去，经过他的家门口时，其母和妻痛哭，他安慰他们说：“这是为了自己的事，受点轻伤，不要紧。”他们村子里刚刚分了地主的浮财，全村农民情绪十分兴奋，纷纷赶来慰问该受伤农民和他的家人。
