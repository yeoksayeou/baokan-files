    Local Armed Forces in Nine Counties of Taihang Mountain Launch Extensive Attacks
    Eliminating 1,200 Chiang Bandit Troops in Two Weeks
    Taigu Militia Achieve Two Victories in Fighting Yan Bandit Troops Seizing Grain
    [This newspaper, Taihang, 3rd dispatch] Since October, our Taihang troops, county battalion soldiers, and the broad masses of militiamen have achieved significant victories in attacking the enemy rear, covering the masses' distribution of autumn harvests and land, and protecting grain struggles. According to statistics from nine counties in the north and south lines, including Huojia, Huolu, Tangyin, Qi County, Jingxing, Yuci, Yuanshi, and Anyang, from the 1st to the 20th of this month, in 20 days, they captured 11 enemy strongholds including Kou Village and Dong Fort (more than ten miles east of Yuanshi City), Berlin Head and Xingzhi (belonging to Shouyang), Cuijia Bridge (east of Anyang City), and Qianhoulu Village (belonging to Tangyin). They killed or wounded 1,136 enemy soldiers including the puppet Wenxian County Chief Yuan Hanshan and the puppet Wuzhi County Township Brigade Captain Liang Hongpu, captured 57 enemy soldiers alive, including a platoon leader from the 2nd Battalion of the 177th Regiment, and seized more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition, 8 machine guns, 107 rifles and carbines, 1 box of explosives, and 68 explosive mines. On the 12th of this month, our 1st Military Sub-district troops, in coordination with battalion soldiers and militiamen of a certain unit in Central Hebei, captured two strongholds, Kou City and Dong Fort, more than ten miles east of Yuanshi City, and defeated a portion of the puppet Hebei Province Security 5th Column that came to reinforce from Yuanshi, killing and capturing more than 200 enemy soldiers. Another main force attacked Lucisijia Village, an enemy stronghold in Huolu, at dawn on the 20th. The enemy fled upon hearing the news, and the village was recovered by us; and a part of the stubborn army who came to aid from Yongbi was defeated, 10 were captured alive, and more than 30 puppet self-defense team captains and others were killed or wounded. The Jingxing militia's landmine warfare has achieved successive victories. On October 12th and 13th, they planted five landmines in Yangziling, Xia'an and other places near Touquan Station. Enemy troops from Huolu city went out to plunder grain and stepped on them, killing or wounding six enemy soldiers. Since the beginning of October, the Yuci militia has launched a flying mine war behind enemy lines, and 63 mines have been detonated in 20 days, killing 18 enemy soldiers and capturing 15. On the 22nd, more than 200 enemy troops from Qi County invaded our Liujie and Shunhedi areas to prevent our masses behind enemy lines from handing over public grain. The enemy launched seven general attacks, but were repelled by our district cadres and militia companies, killing or wounding 20 enemy soldiers and protecting the masses to transport 300,000 catties of public grain to the liberated areas. In addition, Chiang Kai-shek's 41st Division, combined with more than 2,000 security regiments from Wuzhi and Wenxian counties, led by the puppet Wuzhi County Chief Jia Yuyin, swept and looted grain in the heart of our Xiu-Huo-Wu area on the 22nd of this month, attempting to wipe out our Huojia Independent Battalion. Upon receiving the news, we immediately transferred to the outer lines to fight the enemy. After the enemy entered the Dahongqiao and Yanggaozhuang area and found nothing, they looted wantonly. At this time, we unexpectedly surrounded the enemy. At 6:20 a.m. that day, we launched a general offensive. The enemy panicked, became a mess, and fled in all directions. We immediately tracked and pursued them to Wuchekou Village, more than ten miles away, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 30 enemy soldiers, including the puppet Wuzhi County Township Brigade Captain Liang Hongpu, seized one machine gun and more than ten rifles and carbines. After repelling the enemy, the local masses were jubilant and comforted the combat troops with 200 bars of soap.

    [This newspaper, Taihang, 3rd dispatch] Delayed news: The militia and armed work team of the Fourth District of Taigu, in coordination with a certain unit of the military sub-district, repelled two attempts by the Yan bandit troops to seize grain on October 18th and 19th, killing and capturing 15 Yan bandit troops including a battalion political instructor. On the 18th, the Yan bandit 37th Division stationed in Qi County mobilized three battalions of troops to invade Shantai Village in the Fourth District of the county to seize grain. It was discovered by our sub-district × unit and the militia armed work team of the district, and they immediately rose up to resist. After about five hours of fierce fighting, the enemy was repelled, and a Yan bandit battalion instructor was captured alive. We had no casualties. The next day, about 500 Yan bandit 9th Column × Regiment troops stationed in the urban area of Taigu went to Pangcun, Jingshen, Shantai, Podi and other places in the Fourth District to seize grain. As soon as they arrived at Pangcun, they stepped on three landmines (casualties unknown). Then, after our sub-district unit and militia armed work team blocked them head-on and struck from the left and right flanks, the enemy suffered heavy casualties and retreated in panic. In addition to the eight guns seized by the troops, the Fourth District militia alone killed two enemy soldiers, captured twelve alive, seized two machine guns, twelve rifles, more than a thousand rounds of ammunition, fifteen grenades, and many other military supplies. We had no casualties. In two battles in two days, our casualties to the enemy were zero to fifteen. Eight model militiamen, including Wang Gang, emerged. Upon hearing the news, the county headquarters awarded the militia armed work team of the Fourth District a major merit, issued a notice of commendation, and awarded 5,000 silver dollars as an incentive.
