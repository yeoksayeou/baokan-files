　　The guerrilla warfare in various parts of the East China battlefield has entered a new stage with the momentum of a prairie fire since the start of the national counter-offensive. From mid-August to mid-October, the Jiaodong Military Region cooperated with the field army to annihilate more than 10,000 Chiang Kai-shek bandits' main forces, police, and "home-returning corps," and recovered more than 150 towns and villages of all sizes, including Weihaiwei, Muping, Qixia, Changyi, and Taocun. The Bohai Military Region once captured the two cities of Shouguang and Zouping and completely liberated the vast area south of the Yellow River and north of the Xiaoqing River. From mid-July to the 14th of this month, the Luzhong Military Region annihilated nearly 13,000 enemies in four months, recovered 150 strongholds including Linqu City, and once captured Yidu City. The Lunan Military Region annihilated more than 2,000 enemies in October alone, and captured important towns such as Zaozhuang, Lanling, and Dongguo. The Binhai District annihilated 2,700 enemies in the three months of July, August, and September. The Subei Central China District, deep in Chiang's rear, annihilated 3,900 enemies in September and recovered Sheyang of Baoying. At the end of October, it once attacked Huangqiao in Rugao. In Huainan and Huaibei, far from Chiang's rear, guerrilla warfare has also achieved repeated victories. The scale and breadth of the guerrillas' momentum are unprecedented. Its main features are listed as follows: (1) Close coordination of military and political offensives. In the local corps, county, and district armed forces, everyone does propaganda, writes slogans in every village. Following each victory, mass meetings and family members' meetings of bandits and puppets are held in the newly recovered villages, propaganda materials are distributed, and mass rescue movements are organized, so that the enemy will collapse even if they are not defeated. For example, in October, the three counties of Jiaoxian, Gaomi, and Jiaogao (new county) in Jiaodong cooperated with the Changyi South victory to launch a political offensive, and in more than 20 days, they won over more than 2,200 deceived people to return home. In early October, when the Lunan local armed forces attacked Tengxian, Yixian, and Pingyuan, they took advantage of the victory to launch a political offensive. In Lushui (new county, north of Zaozhuang), 538 members of the "home-returning corps" were disintegrated, and 300 members of the joint brigade of the four counties of Zou, Teng, Fei, and Si (Shui) of Chiang Kai-shek bandits have fled. (2) The close coordination of the blasting team, the militia, and local armed forces at all levels with the field army in battles and campaigns. For example, during the Jiaodong Changyi South victory, the people's armed forces of the Luzhong District, which took the initiative to coordinate, captured Panchegou and Bangzihai near Mengyin City on the 5th and 6th of this month, and annihilated more than 600 Chiang Kai-shek bandits of the 45th Division in the Dongjingguda area of Zichuan; the people's armed forces of the Binbei Sub-district actively advanced north, closely monitoring the enemies trapped in Zhucheng and Jiaoxian. A company of the Lu Blasting Battalion of the Jiaodong Military Region and the Xihai Militia Blasting Team cooperated with the field army to carry out front-line blasting and night-time sneak blasting, and annihilated a total of 1,750 Chiang Kai-shek bandits. The Nanhai District Jian Guo Blasting Team laid a minefield 40 miles deep on the Jiaoxian-Pingdu Road, and the local armed forces ambushed, creating a good opportunity for our field army to annihilate the enemy. (3) The active strategy of advancing even when the enemy doesn't. The people's armed forces in Luzhong District launched extensive attacks on the edges of Zichuan and Yidu, south of the Jiaoji Railway, and on both sides of the Xin (Tai)-Wen (Kou) Road, forcing the enemy to be trapped in several isolated cities. After crushing the enemy's "mopping-up" operation in the mountainous areas, Lunan took advantage of the victory to advance into Tengxian, Yixian, and Pingyuan to launch a mopping-up operation, and recovered Zaozhuang twice. The "August 13th" Great March on the southern front of the Subei Central China District crossed the enemy's blockade of fortresses Jiang (Yan) Huang (Qiao), captured the enemy's central stronghold Xuanjiabao in one fell swoop, and directly approached Taixing City, making the enemy exhausted to cope with it. (4) Gradually moving from decentralization to unified command. After the counter-offensive, a large number of emancipated peasants poured into the people's armed forces. Each county and district generally has independent regiments, Baotian brigades, guard regiments, armed work teams, blasting teams, and other organizations. The counties of Binhai recently established a county general regiment headquarters to unify command.

　　采取敌不进我亦进积极方针
  　华东游击战全面发展
    【新华社华东二十五日电】华东战场各地游击战，已于全国大反攻开始后以燎原之势，步入了新的阶段。胶东军区自八月中旬至十月中旬两个月中配合野战军歼灭蒋匪主力、警察、还乡团等万余人，收复威海卫、牟平、栖霞、昌邑、桃村等大小城镇百五十余处，渤海军区一度攻克寿光、邹平二城和全部解放黄河以南、小清河以北广大地区。鲁中军区自七月中旬至本月十四日四个月中歼敌近一万三千人，收复临朐城等百五十余据点，并一度攻克益都城。鲁南军区仅十月间即歼敌二千余名，攻克枣庄、兰陵、东郭等重镇。滨海区在七八九三个月中歼敌二千七百余。深处蒋后之苏中区九月间歼敌三千九百名，收复宝应之射阳等，十月底一度攻入如皋黄桥。苏北淮海地区仅十月上半月即歼敌千余。远处蒋后之淮南、淮北，游击战亦迭获胜利，游击队声势之浩大及广泛为历来所罕见。其主要特点分志如下：（一）军事与政治攻势的密切配合。在地方兵团县区武装中，人人做宣传，庄庄写标语，随着每一胜利在新收复之村庄召开群众大会、匪伪家属大会，散发宣传品，并组织群众性的救人运动，使敌人不被打垮也要跑垮。如十月间，胶东之胶县、高密、胶高（新县）三县配合昌（邑）南大捷开展政治攻势，二十余天中争取被骗群众二千二百余回家。十月上旬，鲁南地方武装进击滕县、峄县、平原时，乘胜开展政治攻势，麓水（新县，枣庄北）瓦解“还乡团”五百三十八人，蒋匪邹、滕、费、泗（水）四县联合大队已逃亡三百余。（二）爆炸队、民兵、各级地方武装在战役战斗上与野战军之机动配合，如胶东昌南大捷时，主动策应之鲁中区人民武装，于本月五、六两日攻克蒙阴城附近之盘车沟、棒子崖，并于淄川东井崮一带歼蒋匪四五师六百余人；滨北分区人民武装积极北进，严密监视困守诸城、胶县之敌。胶东军区垆爆炸营一连和西海民兵爆炸队配合野战军进行阵前爆炸及夜间偷炸，共歼蒋匪一千七百五十名。南海区于建国爆炸队在胶（县）平（度）路纵深四十里布下地雷阵，地方武装则打埋伏，为我野战军创制歼敌良机。（三）敌不进我亦进之主动积极作战方针。鲁中区人民武装，在淄川、益都边沿、胶济线南侧及新（泰）汶（口）路两侧之广泛出击，逼敌困守于几座孤城。鲁南于粉碎敌对山区“扫荡”后，乘胜挺进滕县、峄县、平原展开扫荡，并两次收复枣庄。苏中区南线之“八一三”大进军，越过敌之封锁堡垒姜（堰）黄（桥），一举攻克敌中心据点宣家堡，直逼泰兴城，使敌穷于应付。（四）逐渐由分散走向统一指挥。反攻后翻身农民大批涌进人民武装。各县区普遍有独立团、保田大队、警卫团、武工队、爆炸队等组织。滨海各县最近成立了县总团部统一指挥。
