　　Taiwan's Landlords
    Shi Jun
    My participation in the accusation meeting of Taiwan students at the Military University has deepened my understanding of "the poor of the world are one family," and further clarified the principle that "landlords are evil." The people of Taiwan have lived under more than fifty years of imperialist oppression in a colonial life. The landlords' oppression of peasants is one of the reasons for the dark, poor, and ignorant lives of the colonial people, and it is also the foundation for consolidating imperialist rule.
    1. The Landlords' Rise
    The Zhong Tongchao family is a landlord, owning 25 Jia of paddy fields and 20 Jia of mountains, totaling 45 Jia of land (1 Jia equals 30 Mu in North China), all of which were forcibly purchased. He said: "We have many methods for forced purchases. The first method is to deceive anyone with good land into partnership for business. If they don't have capital, we lend it to them, deliberately causing the business to lose money. When they can't repay the capital, they have to sell the land to us. The second method is to seize ponds, preventing the poor from irrigating, forcing them to sell their land. My family's land and the poor's land are next to each other, sharing a pond. To forcibly buy his land, we pretended to repair the pond. When the poor couldn't afford the money, we seized the pond, depriving him of water. Without water, the land couldn't be cultivated, forcing him to sell to us. The third method is to restrict the poor from cultivating, forcing them to sell their land. My land is around the poor's land. To connect the land into a large piece for easy cultivation, we ask him to sell it to my family. If he refuses, we plant the surrounding land first, leaving no path for the poor to walk. The poor have no choice but to negotiate with us to sell the land. At this time, we tease him, refusing to buy the land. The poor can't cultivate the land, and it's impossible not to sell it, so they have to bear the pain of lowering the price to sell to us. The poor go bankrupt, and our property expands..."
    The Lin Wumei family was originally a rich peasant. In 1940, they lent 9,000 yuan. In a few years, the interest compounded, and the principal generated interest, increasing to more than 30,000 yuan. By seizing water ponds, they gradually became small landlords. He said: "My family's land and the poor's land share a water pond. My land is at the head of the water, and the poor's land is at the tail. When releasing water, we always release it first, and it's the poor's turn last. If we don't release, we don't let the poor release. Often, after we release the water and irrigate the land, the poor's rice is already dried up... When the poor have a bad harvest, they have to borrow money to buy rice. Slowly, they become my family's tenants..."
    Liao Yunxing's uncle is a landlord and also a model Baozhang (local head) for Japanese imperialism. The Japanese trusted him very much and often went to his house to drink and have fun... The Baozhang used this position and opportunity to exploit and plunder the poor. The land increased year by year, from more than 10 Jia of fields to more than 30 Jia in three years.
    In summary, it is truly "crows are black all over the world." People are not rich without exploitation, and landlords are the pawns of imperialism.

    2. Rent Plus Extra Exploitation
    Before tenants rented land, they had to pay a deposit of 10 to 15 percent. If they couldn't pay the rent, the land was taken back, and the deposit was confiscated. Huang Xuanxi said: "Sometimes the rice harvest is not good, and tenants ask to reduce the rent. My father threatened him, saying it can't be reduced. If it is reduced, the land will not be rented to you next year..."
    The rent rate in Taiwan is generally 50 to 60 percent. The best Jia of land can yield 16,000 Jin per year, and more than 8,000 Jin of rent must be paid (excluding various taxes and levies of Japanese imperialism). Some tenants pay more than 60 percent. Liao Yunxing said: "Tenants cultivate 1.1 Jia of my family's land and have to pay 5,500 Jin of rent (the yield can reach 8,000 Jin in a good harvest)... Sometimes my family's chickens, ducks, and geese deliberately go to eat the tenants' rice... When tenants have a bad harvest and ask to reduce a little, my father scolds them for being lazy, saying it's their own fault for not having enough to eat... As a result, the poor work hard for a year in vain."
    In addition, there is extra exploitation. During the New Year and festivals, tenants always have to bring the fattest and largest ducks, geese, and wine and meat to "honor" the landlords. If they don't "honor" them, they are in danger of losing their land. When landlords go to the countryside to collect rent, tenants must slaughter fat chickens and fat geese and make eight large bowls to treat them. When the landlord has something to do, they call on the tenants to do short-term labor, only paying two-thirds of the wages. Sometimes, landlords also demand additional non-staple foods from tenants—sweet potatoes, peanuts, and the like.
    Some poor people cannot afford to rent fields, so they rent mountains. The mountains are full of forests, and there is no rent for the first two years of reclamation. However, after two years of hard work by the poor, the barren mountains have become good fields, and the landlord takes them back. Planting tea on the mountain can be rent-free for seven to ten years, but the tea trees only truly become forests after ten years. Cai Tongshun said: "I rent out more than 10 Jia of mountains to the poor. No rent is required for seven years. The poor will not get many benefits in seven years, but after seven years, I will have more than 10 Jia of good tea mountains... Letting the poor plant for a few years for free does not cause us any losses. Hiring people to plant and manage would cost us much more in wages!"
    If the poor plant and build houses on the mountain, they also have to pay rent. Some landlords do not allow the poor to raise chickens, ducks, and other poultry, saying they damage crops, otherwise they will increase the rent. Liao Yuanxing said: "Tenants live on my family's mountain and pay 100 yuan in rent per year... My father saw their chickens and ducks often scratching in the fields, so he increased the rent by 50 yuan. If the poor couldn't afford it, they were driven away..."
    3. The Miserable Life of Farmers
    Under the high oppression of Japanese imperialism and landlords, the lives of Taiwanese farmers are extremely miserable. They cannot eat enough, cannot keep warm, are often sick, and have to sell their flesh and blood relatives, allowing landlords to bully and trample on them. Fan Yuntai, from a poor peasant family, said: "Because my family was poor, I sold three younger sisters. The first time I borrowed money from the landlord, I couldn't repay it, so I used my younger sister to offset the debt. Because my father was sick and had no money to buy medicine, I sold my second younger sister. Later, the year was bad, and the harvest was not enough to pay the rent, so I sold my third younger sister..." Wang Jinshi worked as a long-term laborer from the age of eight until he was twenty-one. His family of nine had never eaten a meal of dry rice. They only had two quilts. Due to difficult living conditions, they sold four younger sisters one after another. Many poor peasants and hired laborers sold their siblings because their family members died and they had no money to buy coffins for burial.
    It is also common for landlords to force poor people to death. Lü Zizai's father was forced to hang himself because he owed the landlord three hundred yuan and selling two sisters and one younger brother was not enough to pay it off. The landlord even took the five Jiao from the dead man's mouth... The mother also died of illness due to anger. The family ended like this. Huang Hui's father was forced to death because he could not pay the rent, and his mother was also sold.
    What kind of life do the children of poor people who are sold to landlords to repay debts and offset rent live? Liao Yuanxing said: "Tenants couldn't pay the rent, so they sold his daughter to us. She was only a fourteen-year-old girl! My family of twelve relies on her to cook three meals a day, and the non-staple products grown on the mountain also depend on her labor... She gets up early and goes to bed late every day, and what she gets is the beatings, scolding, and bullying of my whole family."

　　台湾的地主
    施均
    我参加了军大台湾同学的述罪大会，使我更加深了“天下穷人是一家”的认识，也更明确了“地主就是罪恶”的道理。台湾人民是过着五十多年的帝国主义压迫的殖民地生活的，地主压迫农民是构成殖民地人民黑暗，贫穷，愚蠢生活的原因之一，且也是巩固帝国主义统治的基础。
    一、地主的起家
    钟通超家是一个地主，有二十五甲田，二十甲山，共四十五甲地（一甲合华北三十亩），都是强买来的。他说：我们强买的方法是很多的，第一种方法，是看到谁的田地好就欺骗他来合伙做买卖，他没有本钱就给塾上，故意把买卖赔了钱，他还不起本钱，就把地卖给我们了。第二种方法，是霸占池塘，不给穷人浇水，逼的他非把田卖掉不可；我家地和穷人地在一起，合用一个池塘，为了强买他的地，我们借故要修理池塘，穷人出不起钱，我们就霸占了池塘，不给他水用，水浇地种不成就被迫卖给我们了。第三种方法，是限制穷人种地，强迫出卖土地；我的地在穷人地的周围，为把地联成一大片耕种方便，叫他卖给我家，如不愿意，我们即在种地时，先把周围的地种上了，不留穷人走的路，穷人没办法，就和我们商量卖地。这时我们就作弄他，不要买地，穷人有地不能种，不卖也不成，只好忍痛压低价钱卖给我们，穷人破产了，我们财产扩大了……
    林五美家本来是一个富农，二十九年放债九千元，几年间，利变本，本变利，增到三万余元，利用霸占水池逐渐变成小地主。他说：我家的田和穷人的田合用一个水池，我的田在水头，穷人的田在水尾。在放水时，总是我们先放，最后才轮到穷人，我们不放就不让穷人放，往往等我们放过水浇了地，穷人的稻子也晒干了……穷人收成不好，就要借钱买米，慢慢地他们变成了我家的佃户……。
    廖运兴伯父是一个地主，也是日本帝国主义的模范保长，日本人很信任他，常到他家吃酒玩乐……保长就利用这个地位和机会，剥削和掠夺了穷人，土地一年年增多，三年间从十多甲田增到三十多甲田。
    综合以上所说，真是“天下乌鸦一般黑”，人无剥削不富、地主就是帝国主义的爪牙。
    二、地租加上额外剥削
    佃户租种田地以前，先要缴押租钱百分之十至十五，缴不起租子就夺回土地，并没收押租钱。黄宣锡说：有时稻子收成不好，佃户要求减轻租子，我的父亲威吓他，不能减，要减下年田不给你种了……。
    台湾的租率一般是百分之五十至六十，一甲最好的地，一年能收一万六千斤，要交八千斤以上的租子（日本帝国主义的各种压榨捐税在外），还有些佃户交到百分之六十以上。廖运兴说：佃户种我家一甲一分田，要五千五百斤的租子（收成好产量可达八千斤）……有时我家的鸡鸭鹅还故意放去吃佃户的稻子……佃户收成不好，要求减轻一点，我父亲骂人家懒惰，不够吃是活该……结果穷人辛辛苦苦干了一年都白干了。
    另外还有额外的剥削，佃户每逢过年过节的时候，总要拿最肥最大的鸭、鹅和酒肉来“孝敬”地主，不“孝敬”就有被夺地的危险。地主下乡收租时，佃户一定要杀肥鸡肥鹅，做成八大碗请客才成。地主有事时叫佃户做短工，只给三分之二的工钱。有时，地主还向佃户额外索取副食品——红薯，花生之类。
    有些穷人租不起田，就租种山，山上都是树林，两年开垦期可以不交租，但穷人经过两年辛勤垦殖的荒山，已变成好田，又给地主拿回去了。开山种茶可以七年至十年不交租，但十年以后，茶树才真正成林。蔡统顺说：我十多甲山就租给穷人种，七年不要租，七年中穷人不会得到很多的利益，而七年后我却有十多甲好的茶山了……给穷人白种几年，我们并不吃亏，要雇人来种植和管理，也不知要多拿出多少工资呢！
    穷人种上，在山上盖房子也要房租，有些地主不准穷人养鸡鸭等家禽，说是毁坏庄稼，否则要增租。廖远兴说：“佃户住在我家山上，年租一百元……我父亲看到他们的鸡鸭常到地里乱抓，就增加房租五十元，穷人拿不起就赶走……”
    三、农民的悲惨生活
    台湾的农民在日帝和地主的高度压榨下，生活是极端悲惨的。吃不饱、穿不暖，经常生病，不得不出卖骨肉亲人，任地主欺侮和糟踏。贫农家庭的范云台说：“因为家穷卖了三个妹妹，第一次借地主的钱，还不起，把妹妹顶债了。因为父亲生病，没钱吃药，卖了第二个妹妹；后来，年成不好，收成不够交租，又卖出了第三个妹妹……”。王金士从八岁给人家当长工直到廿一岁，全家九口人从没吃过一顿干饭，只盖两条被子，因生活困难，先后卖了四个妹妹。很多贫农和雇工都因为家人死了没钱买棺材安葬，而出卖了自己的兄弟姊妹。
    地主逼死穷人也是常有的事。吕自在的父亲只因欠了地主三百块钱，卖了两个姊妹一个弟弟也还不清，结果被地主逼迫吊死了，地主从死人的口里还把五角钱摸走了……母亲也因生气而病死了。一家人就这样完了。黄挥的父亲因交不起租子被逼死了，母亲也出卖了。
    卖给地主还债顶租的穷人子女所过的是什么生活呢？廖远兴说：佃户还不起租子，把他女儿卖给我们，他还是十四岁的小姑娘呀！我家十二口人，每天三餐饭都是她做，山上种的副产品也是靠他劳动……她每天早起晚睡，而她所得到的是我一家人的打骂和欺负。
