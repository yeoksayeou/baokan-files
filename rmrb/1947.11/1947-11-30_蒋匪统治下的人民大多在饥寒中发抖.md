Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th: According to reports from various sources, with the arrival of severe winter, the broad masses of people in the Chiang-controlled areas have fallen into poverty, cold, and starvation under the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's anti-people and criminal rule. All the teachers of Shenyang Municipal No. 2 Middle School, recently forced by the pressure of life, organized a drama troupe to subsidize their living expenses with the proceeds from performances every night. Teachers in county-level schools in Liaoning Province have been forced to suspend classes due to three or four months of arrears in salary. Amidst the cries of hunger and cold, a tragicomedy occurred in Shenyang a few days ago. A couple from a certain government office was suddenly accosted on the way by someone who forcibly checked them, seizing the couple's briefcase. After rummaging through it and finding that it contained only official documents, they returned it but immediately demanded money. The staff member handed over the only 10,000 yuan he had. His wife anxiously shouted, "If you give him all the money, what will we do for groceries tomorrow?" The robber then returned 2,000 yuan and said, "This is my amateur work, I'm so sorry." Chiang Kai-shek's Shenyang Mayor Jin Zhen also admitted: "There are many such amateur robbers." Due to the severe coal shortage, the trees inside and outside the cities north of Shenyang have long been burned out. Now people are demolishing houses to get firewood. The price of coal in Changchun has reached 280,000 yuan per ton in circulating currency. Chiang Kai-shek's Central News Agency also admitted: "Except for a few wealthy families who can still afford to buy coal for heating, the general public and teachers and civil servants are using coal cinders for heating."

　　In Tianjin, plain white and blue cloth have generally risen to over 10,000 yuan per foot, and cotton is 42,000 yuan per catty. The labor cost for a set of ordinary cotton clothes is more than 200,000 yuan. Making a set of ordinary cotton clothes costs at least 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. The general public and teachers and civil servants are worried about winter clothing. Among the more than 1.6 million residents in Tianjin, 300,000 are extremely poor and starving, even eating grass roots and tree bark. According to statistics in Taiyuan, more than 95 percent of the people have been cut off from white flour, and most of them have difficulty securing food for the night. Very few can comfortably cope with two meals a day. In Datong, the rent for a small house is 70,000 to 80,000 yuan, and it must be paid in silver dollars. More than a thousand shops in the city barely manage to keep their doors open every day. When they settle their accounts in the evening, they rarely have enough to cover the day's expenses. Although the Chiang Kai-shek authorities do not allow businesses to close, the shop doors on the streets are plastered with red strips of paper saying "Clearing Accounts, Business Suspended."

　　Wuhu, along the Yangtze River, has been forced to cut off electricity during the day since the 23rd of last month due to a coal shortage, and even the electricity used at night can only last until the end of the month. The Yuzhong Yarn Factory, Yixin Flour Mill, Waterworks, Match Factory, and many rice mills in the area have been forced to shut down. In Anqing, a rice-rich area, the price of rice rose to 440,000 yuan per picul on the 16th of last month. The people were already finding it difficult to make a living, and the Chiang Kai-shek authorities forcibly conscripted 4,000 laborers every day and requisitioned labor and materials on the spot, exacerbating the people's hunger.

　　Dead bodies of starving people are often found in the streets and alleys of Kunming. On the 10th of last month, there were as many as six bodies near the YMCA on Dingxin Street alone. Since the 12th, with the chilling north wind, the number of homeless and dying hunger-stricken people lying on the road has increased even more. In Malong County, Yunnan Province, Zhang Guangming, who was in his thirties, recently felt unable to live and took his son to the Jitou Village on the Sichuan-Yunnan Railway (only a section of which has been built) to commit suicide by lying on the tracks and was cut in two. The vast poor rural people in southwestern Yunnan Province are suffering deeply from the "Chiang Disaster." Famine and destitution are compounded by the intrusion of plague and malignant malaria. In the villages of Daxie and Shuicheng in Sh屏 County alone, the number of people who have died from the disease has reached more than 300, and there are no coffins available for those who die later. The Chiang Kai-shek-controlled county council also admitted: "All the villages in the county are groaning in bed, suffering from poverty and illness, and thousands of people are unable to seek medical treatment and are lying down waiting to die."

　　蒋匪统治下的人民大多在饥寒中发抖
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】据各方报导：严冬降临，在蒋家匪帮反人民罪恶统治下，蒋区广大人民已陷于贫困冻馁。沈阳市立二中全体教师近为生活所迫，组织一话剧团，每天晚上以演戏所得，补助生活费用。辽省各县级学校教师因欠薪三四个月，均被迫停课。饥寒声中，沈市日前竟发生一悲喜剧，某机关夫妇在途中，突有人追上强行检查，将该夫妇皮包夺去，经翻检全系公文，退还后即逼迫要钱，该职员将仅有之万元交出，其妻着急高嚷：“钱都给他，明天买菜怎么办？”该行劫人遂送还二千元并声言“我这是业余工作，太对不起”。蒋匪沈阳市长金镇亦供认：“此种业余强盗极多”。由于煤荒严重，沈阳以北各城市内外树木早被烧光，现正拆屋取柴。长春煤价每吨已达流通券二十八万元，蒋匪中央社亦供认：“除一部富人家尚能购煤取暖外，一般市民及公教人员均以煤渣取暖。”
    天津普遍白布与蓝布均涨到万余元一尺，棉花四万二千元一斤，一套普通棉衣手工费需二十来万元，制一套普通棉衣至少亦须六、七十万元以上，一般市民及公教人员均为冬衣发愁。天津全市一百六十多万居民中，有三十万人赤贫如洗，饥寒交迫，甚至有食草根树皮者。太原据统计有百分之九十五以上的人民已与白面绝缘，且大多数难有隔宿之粮，两餐能应付裕如者极少。大同一间小屋房租索价七、八万元，且非银元付租不可。市上千余家商店每天勉强支持门面，晚上结帐，很少够一天的开销。蒋匪当局虽然不准商号歇业，但大街上店门满贴“清理帐目，停止营业”的红纸条。
    长江沿岸之芜湖因缺煤自上月二十三日起被迫白天停电，且晚间用电，亦仅能维持到月底。该地裕中纱厂、益新面粉厂、自来水厂、火柴厂以及许多碾米厂均已被迫停工。产米丰富之安庆，上月十六日米价每石涨到四十四万元。人民原已难以维持生活，蒋匪当局每日又强征民夫四千人，及就地征集工料，以加重人民饥饿。
    昆明大街小巷时有饿尸发现，上月十日仅鼎新街青年会旁边一地即有六具之多。十二日起北风凛冽中，倒卧马路上无家可归奄奄一息之饥饿者益形增多。滇省马龙县有张光明者，年三十余岁，日前因感无法生活，携其子前往川滇铁路（仅筑成一段）上之鸡头村卧轨自杀，被截成两段。滇西南广大贫穷乡村人民蒙受深重“蒋灾”，在饥饿困顿中鼠疫、恶性疟疾又乘虚而入，仅石屏县属之大写、水城等村落染病已死亡者达三百余人，后死者已无棺可殓。该县蒋匪御用参议会亦供称：“全县各乡村呻吟床第，贫病交迫，无力医治而卧以待毙者有数千余人。”
