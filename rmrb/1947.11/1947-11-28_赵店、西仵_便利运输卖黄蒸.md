　　Zhao Village, Xi Wu
    Facilitating Transportation by Selling Yellow Steamed Buns
    [Report from Li Cheng by this newspaper] The masses of Zhao Village and Xi Wu in the first district, in order to facilitate transportation and carry out winter production, specially convened a meeting of shop assistants from both villages on the morning of November 20th to specifically discuss how to transform the shops. Shen Dexian, a shop assistant from Zhao Village, said: "If we want to carry out winter production and reduce the expenses of migrant workers transporting grain, we must transform the shops. We should sell less ramen, sesame cakes, and buns; and sell more yellow steamed buns, fried rice soup, and other coarse foods in large quantities." Everyone thought this made a lot of sense, as it would benefit both parties. So they discussed and stipulated unified prices: using the fire at night was 80 yuan per night, using the fire for livestock was 100 yuan per night, using the fire in the morning and at noon was 80 yuan, renting a new quilt was 100 yuan per night, and a used quilt was 80 yuan, and each half-jin yellow steamed bun was 50 yuan. They also discussed and formulated mutual inspection and reward measures. Whoever transforms their shop well will be rewarded and commended, using a loudspeaker to broadcast and promote other shops. They also mobilized women to organize to sell yellow steamed buns and vegetable soup. After discussion, Zhao Village temporarily organized three women's groups to sell convenient meals, and one men's group to sell convenient meals. Xi Wu also organized four women's groups to sell convenient meals. These groups are all integrated with textile production, and jointly approve the report. (Ren Qing, Feng Chen)

　　赵店、西仵
    便利运输卖黄蒸
    【本报黎城讯】一区赵店、西仵群众，为了便利运输开展冬季生产，特于十一月二十号上午，召开两村店员会议，专门讨论如何改造店房问题，赵店店员申德贤说：“要想开展冬季生产及减少运粮民工开支盘费，必须改造店房，要少卖拉面、烧饼、包儿；大批出卖黄蒸，炒米汤等粗饭。”大家都认为这个道理很对，这样干才能做到两合适。于是就讨论规定出统一价钱：黑夜光人起火一夜八十元，赶牲口起火一夜一百元，早晨晌午起火八十元，赁新被子一条一夜一百元，半旧被子一条八十元，黄蒸每个半斤重五十元。又讨论订出互相检查与奖励办法，谁家改造的好，要奖励表扬，用喇叭筒广播，推动其他店房。又在妇女中进行动员组织卖黄蒸菜汤。经讨论后，赵店临时新组织起三个妇女卖便饭组，一个男人卖便饭组，西仵也组织起四个妇女卖便饭组，这些组都是与纺织结合进行，共同批红。（任卿、逢辰）
