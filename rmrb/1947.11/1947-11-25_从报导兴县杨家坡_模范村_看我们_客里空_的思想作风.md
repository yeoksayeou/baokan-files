From Reporting on Xingxian Yangjiapo "Model Village"
　　Seeing Our "Keli Kong" Ideological Style
    Jin Sui Daily Editorial Department, Jin Sui Xinhua Main Branch

    I. Only Reporting on Heroic Activities, Not Reflecting Mass Activities.

    From the summer of 1944 to the autumn of 1945, this newspaper devoted significant coverage to various work in Yangjiapo Administrative Village, Second District of Xingxian County. This was because Yangjiapo was then a model village in Xingxian, and its labor hero, Wen Xiangshuan, was one of the most prominent "Labor Models" in the entire border region. The newspaper's leadership emphasized "continuous reporting on typical examples," stressing that problems and experiences in various works should be reflected first and promoted to various places through the newspaper, the so-called "typical demonstration" and "typical guidance." At the same time, the newspaper office was stationed with the Second District's leading organs, and both the newspaper's leading comrades and those managing Xingxian's communications work repeatedly emphasized to the leaders of Xingxian and the Second District, using considerable effort to organize correspondents to write articles, aiming to achieve the expected goals. To complete this task, at the start of each work, whether at the county or district level, cadres with writing skills were sent to the village to assist, and then write articles. Sometimes, when the materials were incomplete, comrades from the newspaper office would personally visit to supplement them, so as to make the news "comprehensive and prominent." After Yangjiapo was awarded "Model Village for Organized Labor" at the Fourth Congress of Heroes in the winter of 1944, its work received even more attention from all sides. But in reality, it seriously promoted the formalistic style of the time and had a very bad propaganda impact.

    Because we emphasized the "leading role of heroes," when guiding correspondents in writing, we also asked them to pay attention to reflecting this aspect of the material. As a result, all news reports and communications were prefaced with "Conducted under the leadership of Wen Xiangshuan," and the content was monotonous, always focusing on the activities of a few "heroes" or "models." The October 18, 1944, front-page headline on the second page of this newspaper, "Wen Xiangshuan Village Launches Autumn Harvest Competition," only reported on Wen Xiangshuan and the "reformed" loafer Wen Chuer, as well as the activities of the so-called "Labor Model" Yangjiapo Village's Yang Zhaiduo and Yangjiaping's "Liu Didan Cooperative." There was no reporting on the autumn harvest situation and difficulties of the vast majority of farmers. When reporting on women's weaving, it only wrote about how "weaving heroes" Yang Yuer, Yang Aiying, and others "led the development" of cotton spinning and weaving, but what was the weaving situation of the vast majority of women? It was invisible. Therefore, our news reports and communications all became monotonous and impoverished "hero" chronicles detached from the masses.

    II. Only Seeing the Rich Clothing and Food of Landlords, Wealthy People, and Cadres, Not Seeing the Painful Lives of Poor Farmers.

    Another major weakness of our reporting was the lack of a clear class viewpoint. The article "Xingxian Yangjiapo Mutual Aid Experience" published on the second page of this newspaper on February 20, 1945, was a summary of the village's expanded meeting to review mutual aid. It said that Wen Xiangshuan's "model mutual aid group" mainly involved Wen Xiangshuan's draft cattle plowing land for the "transformed" loafer, giving him food, and the loafer working for him in return. The production problems of poor and hired farmers were not mentioned at all. The same spirit was also embodied in the village's 1945 production plan personally written by Comrade Shen Yue, commissioner of the First Administrative Region (second page of this newspaper on February 13, 1945). Instead of mobilizing rent reduction and anti-rent struggles against landlords and feudalism to liberate poor farmers, it proposed, "This year, land reclamation should mainly support the poor who have been liberated and those who have just been liberated, so that they can truly be liberated." This made people feel that there was not a single poor farmer in the entire Yangjiapo administrative village who had not been liberated from feudal exploitation. Sometimes, numbers were used to illustrate that the poor masses were already "well-fed." The news "Yangjiapo's Work Achieves Remarkable Results" on the second page of this newspaper on February 13, 1945, stated that the entire administrative village had achieved "cultivating three and saving one," and listed the number of weaving women and weaving tools in the village, with some natural villages having achieved "self-sufficiency in clothing." This was obtained by averaging the number of cloths woven in each village by the population, without explaining who was weaving, who controlled the tools and technology, and who had "self-sufficiency." In reality, most of the tools and technology were controlled by landlords and other wealthy people, and only some village cadres, heroes, and wealthy middle peasants had achieved "self-sufficiency." The vast majority of poor and hired peasants had no clothes to wear. At that time, in Wen Xiangshuan's natural village, Wenjiazhai, there were many ten-year-old children with bare bellies, and the women's clothes were also very ragged.

    III. Elevating the Formalistic Style as a Typical Example.

    There was a serious formalistic style in reporting on Yangjiapo's work. On December 5, 1944, Lin Liming's front-page headline in this newspaper, "Xingxian Yangjiapo Administrative Village Formulates Winter Production Plan, Launches 'November' Movement, and Embarks on Long-Term Construction," reported that the plan was "each household to dig up one stone of grain in winter, and the entire administrative village to dig up five hundred large stones of grain." There were ten major plans: "1. Transport 500,000 catties of coal; 2. Transport 5,000 catties of salt; 3. Weave 500 bolts of cloth; 4. Press 5,000 catties of oil; 5. Grind 500 catties of flour; 6. Cut 50,000 catties of wild grass; 7. Each household to accumulate 50 loads of manure; 8. Boil 50 catties of saltpeter per month; 9. Run five winter schools and five literacy classes, with cadres and militia learning 500 new characters; 10. Develop 500 cooperative members and raise 500,000 yuan in shares." The following spring, the comrades in the newspaper office responsible for managing Xingxian's communications work asked the village for a summary of the winter production plan. The comrades in charge of the Second District said, "Due to the enemy's 'mopping-up' operations, the plan was not completed, and there is no summary. It is not good to publish the production plan of the model village in the newspaper if it is not completed." We also agreed with this. In reality, the plan was not completed not because of the impact of the war, but because the plan was fundamentally a typical example of commandism and formalism. Before the "November" movement was launched in Yangjiapo Village, the leading comrades of the Second District held a meeting in advance to discuss and formulate the plan, and the comrades in the newspaper office responsible for managing Xingxian's communications work also attended and listened. I remember that they read the "Liberation Daily" editorial on launching the "November" movement in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, and then read the "November" movement plan of Yan'an County, before discussing and formulating Yangjiapo's "November" movement plan, which was finally announced at the Yangjiapo election of "Labor Models" conference.

    The formalistic style of reporting on the work of Yangjiapo "Model Village" reached its highest point at the expanded meeting in February 1945. At that time, the Border Region Administrative Office and the First Administrative Office jointly held an expanded village meeting in Yangjiapo as an experiment, and wanted to gain experience to guide various places. Comrade Yan Xiufeng, deputy director of the Civil Education Department of the Administrative Office, and Comrade Shen Yue, commissioner of the First Administrative Office, both personally led the meeting in the village. In order to report well on the village's expanded meeting and make its experience guide various places, the newspaper office proposed to Xingxian's leading comrades to organize a vigorous report. They transferred a group of cadres with writing skills from the Experimental School, the Literary and Art Troupe, the July Drama Troupe, and the Administrative Office to participate in the meeting and write articles at the same time. Comrade Shen Yue personally guided them, and a total of ten people participated in the writing. Many people were nominally participating in the work of the conference, but in reality, they spent a lot of time collecting materials and writing articles. Comrade Shen Yue specifically assigned them to write what and how to write. These articles were continuously published in this newspaper for ten days, from February 12th to March 1st (interrupted by the New Year's holiday from the 14th to the 19th, when only half a page was published, so they were not published). The content of these articles raised the individual surface phenomena of the village to the highest organizational form. For example, mutual aid in work was emphasized as learning "Wen Xiangshuan's group's disruption of cultivation" and "Yang Zhaiduo's group's mutual aid cooperative." Weaving was emphasized as learning "Yang Yuer's weaving cooperative, taking the fast machine as the center, uniting women to develop weaving." At the same time, when the newspaper office processed these articles, it emphasized raising incomplete materials to a very high form. For example, the original manuscript of the article "Organizational Leadership Experience of Combining Labor and Military Affairs" was "The militia are woven into the work teams. In wartime, each village's work team first helps the militia with harvesting, and Gongjiashan also carries out large-scale work to rush the harvest." The editor added, "If the leadership is good, it can form a large-scale work team for the entire village, like the Gongjiashan large-scale work autumn harvest, strengthening the concept of mass unity and mutual assistance." At that time, we were publishing Yangjiapo's commandism and formalistic style as valuable experience to promote various places.

    IV. "Heroes" Are Omnipotent, and All Good Things Are Done by "Heroes."

    Under the guidance of this ideological style, some correspondents, in order to make the "role of heroes" prominent, even attributed work that was not done by him to the "hero." The most obvious fact is the news on the first page, second article, of this newspaper on November 5, 1944, written by Wen Shan, "Comrade Wen Xiangshuan Buries Landmines to Kill Four Enemy Puppets, Leads Militia to Pursue Enemy and Recover Nine Heads of Cattle and Donkeys." Because the message did not emphasize the combination of labor and military affairs of Wen Xiangshuan, after it was published, the Propaganda Department of the Sub-bureau only saw the message and did not understand the actual situation, and immediately pointed out that the handling of the manuscript was improper - the position was not prominent enough. Therefore, on the 9th, it was re-published in the headline position on the first page of this newspaper, "A Model of Combining Labor and Military Affairs, Wen Xiangshuan Leads Militia to Repel the Enemy." The article "Wen Xiangshuan's Series of Landmines" written by Yin Yushen (front-page headline of this newspaper on November 11), described how Wen Xiangshuan held meetings to command the militia to fight, bury landmines, and when the enemy was blown up, "Old Wen and four militiamen cracked their mouths and smiled." With a literary style, Wen Xiangshuan's actions were depicted as "vividly specific and lifelike," which was purely imaginative fabrication. In fact, it was not Wen Xiangshuan who led the militia to bury mines and blow up the enemy, but the village cadre Wen Guowang. Wen Guowang had only asked Wen Xiangshuan to take a look at the mine, and then Wen Xiangshuan took women and children to transfer. But the writer insisted on adding this achievement to Wen Xiangshuan, and did not mention Wen Guowang at all. When he saw the newspaper, he was very dissatisfied and said, "Everything is done by the hero!" The masses in the village also had the same reaction. Later, the leaders of the Second District were afraid that this would affect the unity of the cadres, and they proposed it to the newspaper office, but we did not make the necessary review and correction. Until the Fourth Congress of Heroes, Wen Xiangshuan was still reporting the fact of blowing up the enemy at the conference. Emphasizing reporting on "heroes" only made Comrade Wen Xiangshuan separated from the masses and promoted the idea of personal championship.

    V. Describing the New Local Tyrant as a "Harmonious Patriarch."

    Even more wrong was describing Liu Didan, the new local tyrant of Yangjiaping, as a "cooperative hero." The article "Liu Didan and the Yangjiaping Cooperative" jointly written by Bai Ri and Zhen Zhang, the district-level responsible comrades who directly led the village's work, was published on the entire fourth page of this newspaper on October 29, 1944, as well as the news of the Yangjiapo expanded meeting in February 1945. They were all described as "selfless," "enduring hardship before others," and "serving the people" "cooperative heroes," who were the "harmonious patriarch" of the entire Yangjiaping village. They had long wanted to commend Liu Didan, and the newspaper office also asked them to write, but they delayed for more than half a year without writing it. Later, Comrade Wang Dacheng believed that Liu Didan's Yangjiaping Cooperative was "the direction of the development of the new democratic economy in the base area." He personally went to the newspaper office to urge and ask, "Why hasn't this article been published yet?" The person in charge of the communications department at the time replied, "It has not been received." He immediately went to the Second District to urge writing. At that time, we looked at it and felt that there was no fact that Liu Didan "endured hardship before others," so we asked the author, and they told us the following fact: "The cooperatives of several villages went to Linxian to transport back the necessary goods and materials, and no one took them out to sell when they were placed in the village. When he found out, he put down his work in the village and carried things to other villages to sell, and it took him several days to sell everything before he came back." The comrade who revised the manuscript then added this.

    VI. In Order to Respect the Opinions of Local Leaders, Losing the Standpoint of Speaking for the Masses.

    Reporting on "hero model villages" could only say good things, not bad things. On January 20, 1945, this newspaper published the article "Two Problems in Public Grain" on page four, jointly written by Bai Ri@ and Zhen Zhang, reporting on the situation of public grain collection and rent reduction and anti-rent in Yangjiapo Village. The original text was, "When the farmers' association was convened in Yangjiapo Administrative Village to mobilize the masses for rent reduction and anti-rent, the tenants believed that the rent had been reduced last year. Although this year's adzuki bean harvest was not as good as last year's, they did not dare to propose rent reduction to the landlords. As a result, the landlords took the opportunity to collect the rent according to last year's rent amount." After the newspaper was published, Bai Ri@ himself believed that "it was not good to criticize Yangjiapo Village's work in this way, because Yangjiapo was a 'border region model village,' and the masses' fighting spirit was 'very strong' and their level of awareness was 'very high.' It could not be said that the masses did not dare to propose rent reduction to the landlords. The masses were not afraid of the landlords. This was without a mass viewpoint." He asked the newspaper office to correct it and remove the above paragraph. He first proposed it to the comrades in charge of Xingxian's communications work, and after a debate, he was rejected. He hurriedly proposed it to the leading comrades of the newspaper office. At that time, we also wavered. Under the view of "respecting" the opinions of local work leaders, we forgot that respecting the opinions of the masses and telling the truth for the masses was the most important and incomparable main position of our newspaper. Therefore, on February 2nd, we made the following correction on page four: In the article "Two Problems in Public Grain," the phrase "but they did not dare to propose rent reduction to the landlords" should be changed to "some individual farmers have not yet proposed rent reduction to the landlords."

    From the news reports and communications of Yangjiapo, it is very clear to illustrate how our past communications reporting work did not have a mass viewpoint and class viewpoint, how we lacked the spirit of seeking truth from facts, and how seriously the "Keli Kong" ideology and style existed.

### 从报导兴县杨家坡“模范村”　看我们“客里空”的思想作风

　　从报导兴县杨家坡“模范村”
  　看我们“客里空”的思想作风
    晋绥日报编辑部　晋绥新华总分社
    一、只报导英雄动态，不反映群众活动。
    本报于一九四四年夏到四五年秋，有颇大的重要篇幅报导兴县二区杨家坡行政村的各种工作。因为杨家坡当时是兴县的模范村，该村的劳动英雄温象拴也是全边区“劳模”中有数的人物。报社领导上强调提出“连续报导典型”，各种工作中的问题与经验应首先反映出来，利用报纸推广各地，所谓“典型示范”，“典型指导”。同时，报社又和二区领导机关驻在一起，无论报社领导同志和管理兴县通讯工作的同志，均向兴县和二区领导上再三再四强调提出，用了相当大的力量组织通讯员写稿，要求做到预期的目的。他们为了完成此项任务，在每一工作开始时，无论是县上或区上均把有写作能力的干部派到该村协助工作，然后写稿，有时材料不完整时，报社同志还亲自访问补充材料。为的是使消息能“全面突出”。到四四年冬，杨家坡被四届群英大会奖为“组织起来的模范村”后，其工作更为各方所重视。但在实际上，是严重地助长当时形式主义的作风，起了很坏的宣传影响。
    由于我们强调了“英雄的领导作用”。指导通讯员写稿时也叫他们注意反映这方面的材料，因而所有的消息通讯都冠以“温象拴领导下进行的”，内容是千篇一律，老是几个“英雄”或“模范”的活动。四四年十月十八日本报二版头条“温象拴村展开秋收竞赛”消息，只报导温象拴和他“改造”的二流子温初儿，以及所谓“劳模”的杨家坡村之杨寨多，杨家坪“刘地旦合作社”的动态，对广大农民的秋收情形及困难则没有报导。在报导妇女纺织时，也只写“纺织英雄”杨雨儿、杨爱英等人如何“领导发展”纺花织布，但广大妇女的纺织情况又怎样呢？就看不见了。因之，我们的消息通讯均变成内容贫乏老一套的，脱离群众的“英雄”纪事了。
    二、只看到地主富有者、干部的丰衣足食，看不到贫苦农民的痛苦生活
    我们的报导另一最大的弱点是没有明确的阶级观点。四五年二月廿日本报二版载“兴县杨家坡变工经验”一文里，是该村扩大会检讨变工的总结性经验。说温象拴的“模范变工组”，主要是温象拴的耕牛给“转变”的二流子耕地，给他饭吃，二流子给他种地还工。对贫雇农民的生产问题则一点也没有提到。同样的精神也体现在一专区专员沈越同志亲自写的该村四五年的生产计划中（四五年二月十三日本报二版），该计划是根据边区四五年“三大任务”的精神订定的。不从发动减租查租向地主封建斗争中，使贫苦农民翻身。而提出“今年开荒主要是扶植翻身后及刚翻身的穷人，使他们真正翻身。”使人看了，感到杨家坡全行政村，已没有一个在封建剥削下未翻身的贫苦农民。有时，则以数目字来说明贫苦群众已经“丰衣”了。四五年二月十三日本报二版“杨家坡工作成绩卓著”消息，说全行政村已做到“耕三余一”，并列举该村有多少纺织妇女和纺织工具，有些自然村已做到“穿衣自给”，是把各村织布数量用人口来平均得出的，没有说明纺织的是什么人，工具技术被谁掌握，那些人“自给”了。实际上，大部分是地主以及其他富裕者掌握了工具和技术，仅有一些村干部、英雄及富裕中农才做到“自给”，广大贫雇农是没有衣穿的。那时，温象拴所在自然村温家寨，则有很多十来岁的赤肚孩子，妇女穿的也很破烂。
    三、提高形式主义作风的典型。
    报导杨家坡工作，存在着严重的形式主义的作风。四四年十二月五日，林理明写的本报一版头条：“兴县杨家坡行政村，制订冬季生产计划，开展‘十一’运动，着手长期建设”消息。该计划是“每户冬季刨闹一石粮，全行政村刨闹五百大石粮。”有十大计划：“一、运炭五十万斤；二、运盐五千斤；三、织布五百匹；四、榨油五千斤；五、磨粉五百斤；六、割野草五万斤；七、每户积肥五十驮；八、每月熬硝五十斤；九、办五个冬学，五个识字班，干部民兵齐识五百个生字；十、发展合作社员五百人，集股五十万元。”次年春，报社管理兴县通讯工作同志，要该村冬季生产计划总结材料，二区负责同志说：“因敌人‘扫荡’，没有完成计划，没有总结。模范村的生产计划完不成，在报纸上发表也不好。”我们也这样的同意了。实际上计划没完成，并不是什么战争影响， 而该计划根本是强迫命令与形式主义的典型。 在杨家坡村开展“十一”运动前，二区领导同志曾事先开会讨论，拟定了计划办法，报社管理兴县通讯工作的同志也与会旁听，记得他们把“解放日报”开展陕甘宁边区“十一”运动的社论念了一遍，又读了延安县的“十一”运动计划后，然后讨论订定杨家坡的“十一”运动计划，最后在杨家坡选举“劳模”大会宣布的。
    报导杨家坡“模范村”的工作，形式主义的作风到达最高点，是四五年二月的扩大会。那时，边区行署与一专署共同在杨家坡召开村扩大会作为实验，并要取得经验，指导各地。行署民教处副处长阎秀峰同志、一专署专员沈越同志均亲在该村领导，报社为把该村扩大会报导得好，使其经验能指导各地，向兴县领导同志提出要组织大力报导。他们从实验学校、文艺工作团、七月剧团、行署调了一批有写作能力的干部，一面参加该会工作，一面写稿。沈越同志亲自指导，参加执笔者共十人，很多人名义上是参加大会的工作，实际上很多时间用于搜集材料写稿上，沈越同志具体指定他们写什么怎么写。这些稿子连续在本报刊登了十天，从二月十二日到三月一日（中间自十四日至十九日是放年假改出半张，故未刊登。）这些稿件内容，是将该村个别的表面现象，提高到最高的组织形式。如变工互助则强调学习“温象拴组的打乱耕作”，“杨寨多组的变工合作社”。纺织则强调学习“杨雨儿纺织合作社，以快机为中心，团结妇女发展纺织。”同时，报社处理这些稿中，对有不完整的材料又强调提高到很高的形式。如“劳武结合的组织领导经验”一文，原稿是“民兵花编在变工组里，各村变工队在战时先帮助民兵收割，弓家山还大变工抢收。”编辑则加上“如领导的好，可形成全村大变工，象弓家山大变工秋收一样，加强群众团结互助的观念。”那时，我们是在把杨家坡的强迫命令、形式主义的作风，作为宝贵经验来发表，以推动各地哩。
    四、“英雄”万能，什好事也是“英雄”做的。
    在这种思想作风指导下，有些通讯员为要使“英雄的作用”突出，甚至把不是他做的工作，也加在“英雄”的头上。最明显的事实是本报四四年十一月五日一版二条消息，文山写的“温象拴同志埋地雷毙敌伪四名，领导民兵追击敌人夺回牛驴九头。”因消息中未将温象拴劳武结合强调提出来，发表后，分局宣传部只看到消息，不明实际情况，当即指出该稿处理失当——放得地位不显著。因之，又于九日再次在本报一版头条地位重新发表“劳武结合的典范，温象拴率民兵击退敌寇”。银于申写的“温象拴的连环地雷”一文（十一月十一日本报四版头条），把温象拴如何开会指挥民兵战斗、埋地雷、爆炸敌人时，“老温和四个民兵裂开嘴笑了。”以文艺笔调，把温象拴动作描绘得“生动具体，逼真活现”，更纯属想象捏造。事实上，原来并不是温象拴率领民兵埋雷爆炸敌人，而是村干部温国旺。只是温国旺曾叫温象拴看了一下雷，以后温象拴即带妇孺转移了。而写稿的人硬把这功绩加在温象拴身上，温国旺则一字不提及。当他看到报纸后曾大为不满说：“什么也是英雄的！”该村群众也有同样反映。后来，二区领导上怕干部为此而影响团结，向报社提出，我们却未作必要的检讨与更正。直到四届“群英”大会，温象拴仍在大会上报告爆炸敌人的事实。强调报导“英雄”，只有使温象拴同志脱离群众，并助长了个人锦标主义思想。
    五、把新恶霸描写成“和睦的家长”。
    更加错误的是把杨家坪新恶霸刘地旦，说成是“合作英雄”，直接领导该村工作的区级负责同志白日、甄章两人合写的“刘地旦与杨家坪合作社”一文，刊在本报四四年十月二十九日四版整版，以及四五年二月杨家坡扩大会消息，都把他描写成“大公无私”、“吃苦在前”、“为人民服务”的“合作英雄”，是杨家坪全村的“和睦的家长”。他们早就要表扬刘地旦，报社也叫他们写，但他们拖延半年多没有写出来。后来，王达成同志认为刘地旦的杨家坪合作社，是“根据地新民主主义经济发展的方向”，他曾亲自到报社催问“为何还不发表该文？”当时通讯科负责人答复：“没有收到。”他即到二区催写。当时我们看了，觉得刘地旦“吃苦在前”没有事实，就询问作者，他们就告诉如下一件事实：“有好几个村子的合作社一起到临县驮回布匹必需品，放在村里没人拿出去卖，他知道了，放下务庄稼，背东西到外村发卖，一连数天，把东西卖完才回来。”改稿的同志于是就把这加上去了。
    六、为尊重地方领导意见，失掉为群众讲话的立场。
    报导“英雄模范村”是只能说好的，不能说坏的。四五年一月二十日本报四版发表白日＠、甄章合写的“公粮中的两个问题”一文，报导杨家坡村征公粮与减租查租的情形。其原文是“在杨家坡行政村召开农会，发动群众减租查租时，佃户们认为去年已减租了，虽然今年的红豆收成不如去年好，但也不敢提出向地主减租，结果地主就抽空按去年收租额先把租子收去了。”报纸发表后，白日＠自己认为“这样批评杨家坡村的工作不好，因为杨家坡是‘边区模范村’，群众斗争性‘很强’，觉悟程度‘很高’，不能说群众不敢提出向地主减租，群众是不怕地主的，这是没有群众观点。”要求报社更正，取消上述一段文字。他先向管理兴县通讯工作的同志提出，经过争论后，被拒绝了。他又急忙向报社领导同志提出，那时，我们也动摇了。为“尊重”地方工作领导同志意见的观点下，却忘记了尊重群众意见，为群众讲老实话，才是我们报纸第一等重要的，无可比拟的主要的立场。于是在二月二日四版作了如下的更正：“公粮中的两个问题”文中“但也不敢向地主提出减租”一语，应改为“有个别农民还没向地主提出减租。”
    我们从报导杨家坡的消息通讯中，很明白的说明了我们过去的通讯报导工作，是如何没有群众观点和阶级观点，是如何缺乏实事求是精神，是如何严重地存在着“客里空”的思想和作风。
