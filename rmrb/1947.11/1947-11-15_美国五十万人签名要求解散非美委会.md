　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 9th: New York dispatch: American democrats continue to pursue the "House Un-American Activities Committee," demanding its dissolution. Marshall, chairman of the American League for the Defense of Human Rights, recently stated that the League has circulated a petition calling for the abolition of the "House Un-American Activities Committee," and the number of signatures will reach 500,000. The League also hosted a welcome reception for the ten Hollywood writers and directors, attended by many well-known American writers, artists, and union leaders. These ten writers were recently deemed guilty of "contempt of Congress" for refusing to answer the unreasonable questions of the "House Un-American Activities Committee." At the same time, more than forty American celebrities participated in a national broadcast, urging listeners to write to Congress, calling for the abolition of the "House Un-American Activities Committee." They denounced the committee's recent "investigation and trial" of Hollywood as undoubtedly a blow to American cultural freedom and civil rights, reminiscent of Hitlerism.

　　美国五十万人签名要求解散非美委会
    【新华社陕北九日电】纽约讯：美国民主人士继续追击“众院非美活动委员会”，要求予以解散。美维护人权大会主席马绍尔最近称：该会已散发一种要求取消“非美活动委员会”的请求书，签名者将达五十万人。该会并主持对好莱坞十位作家与导演的欢迎会，到会者有美国著名作家，艺术家及工会领袖多人。此十位作家最近因拒答“非美活动委员会”之无理质问而被其认为有“藐视国会”之罪。与此同时，美国四十多位名流参加全国性广播，要求听众致函国会，呼吁取消“非美活动委员会”。他们指斥该委员会最近对好莱坞的“侦审”，无疑是对美国文化自由与公民权利的打击，令人不禁想起希特勒主义。
