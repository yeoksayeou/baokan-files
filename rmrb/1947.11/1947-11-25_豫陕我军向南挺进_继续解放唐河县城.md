　　Yu-Shaan Our Army Advances Southward
  　Continues to Liberate Tanghe County Seat
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yu-Shaan Front, 23rd] Our army, having liberated Biyang, continued to advance towards Tanghe County seat southeast of Nanyang on the 20th. The defending enemy, upon hearing the news, abandoned the city and fled southeast, and the city was liberated by our forces.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yu-Shaan Front, 23rd] Frontline reporter Feng Mu reported: The reporter interviewed a group of commanders and fighters who were credited for their valor in the Jianxian assault and annihilation battle. They unanimously agreed that the reason for the rapid victory in this battle was mainly the coordinated and consistent actions of the infantry, engineers, artillery, and various arms. Infantry assault team members, engineer demolition experts, and artillerymen told the reporter that they had worked together to prepare everything before the battle began. They dug communication trenches together, found firing positions together, reconnoitered the terrain together, and studied all the possible temporary shortcomings, stipulating extremely strict and scientific signals. All this preparation was meticulously completed not only between infantry, engineers, and artillery, but also between various artillerymen and demolition experts. As a result, Jianxian city, with its deep trenches, high ramparts, and extremely strong defenses, was quickly destroyed after our offensive began. After the battle, the infantry, engineers, and artillery praised each other for their excellent completion of the mission. Throughout the battle, each important explosion dealt a fatal blow to the enemy. In the first explosion of the city wall, six warriors, including Zhang Siru, crossed layers of blockades and blasted open the iron-clad city gate, which was blocked by the enemy with layers of sandbags, sending the defenders flying into the sky. In the second explosion of the last stronghold, engineer Huang Zhongde rushed to the enemy's face and blasted the three-zhang-high stronghold gate wall into a pile of rubble.

　　豫陕我军向南挺进
  　继续解放唐河县城
    【新华社豫陕前线二十三日电】解放泌阳我军，二十日续向南阳东南之唐河县城挺进，守敌闻风弃城向东南逃窜，该城当为我解放。
    【新华社豫陕前线二十三日电】前线记者冯牧报导：记者访问了一群参加郏县攻坚歼灭战而被记功的指战员，他们一致认为此次战斗所以迅速获胜，主要是步、工、炮及各兵种配合动作之协同一致。步兵突击队员、工兵爆炸手和炮手们告诉记者，当战斗开始之前，他们曾协同进行了一切准备工作。一起开交通壕，一起找火力阵地，一起侦察地形，并研究了一切临时可能发生的缺点，规定了极其严密而科学的信号。这一切准备工作，不仅是在步、工、炮之间，也在各种炮手与各爆炸手之间周密的完成。于是深沟高垒，防御极坚固的郏县城，在我进攻开始后，即迅速被摧毁无遗。当战斗结束后，步、工、炮各兵种到处互相称赞卓越的完成任务。在整个战斗中，每次重要的爆炸都给敌人致命的打击。第一次爆炸城墙，张四如等六名勇士穿过封锁线的层层障碍，把敌人用数层沙袋堵塞起来的铁叶城门炸裂，守敌都抛到天空中。第二次爆炸最后一个据点，工兵黄中德一直冲到守敌面前，把三丈高的据点门墙炸成一堆瓦砾。
