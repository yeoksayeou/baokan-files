Jincheng Fifth District
Summarizes and Inspects Wheat Planting

[This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 2nd] The Jincheng Fifth District, at a district-wide village cadre meeting on the 21st, inspected and summarized autumn planting. The district has already planted 87,958 mu of wheat, with over 23,900 mu still being rushed into planting, a possible increase of 34,493 mu compared to previous years. This time, all villages have organized men, women, and children, allocating labor according to ability to work in the fields. In Shantou Village, able-bodied laborers carry manure and do heavy work, while women and children clear stubble and prepare the land, and old men plow and sow. Secondly, cadres have indeed played a leading role. When Shuishui Village initially started planting, people were afraid of insect attacks, and no one wanted to plant first. The cadres used black alum to kill pests and planted first, and everyone followed suit. In villages lacking livestock, cadres found ways to organize "qiang ploughs" to plow the land or had people pull seed drills to sow. Villages like Jincun organized over a hundred "qiang ploughs" per village to plow, and implemented labor exchange between groups and villages, adjusting manpower and livestock, so that the vast majority of villages were able to plant. However, there are also individual villages where the leadership did not focus on wheat planting and allowed it to drift. For example, Fucheng Village felt it had difficulty with livestock, but did not organize "qiang ploughs," allowing the masses to wait for animals. As a result, households without animals have not planted yet. Other villages like Beishidian and Zhaozhuang suffered losses by looking after themselves, and have only planted 50-60% of their land.

[This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 2nd] The Sanlian base point villages of Yangcheng Fourth District, including Baijian, Beiyan, Gulong, Sihou, and Wenmin, have initially summarized their autumn planting work. From October 9th to 23rd, in fourteen days, relying on 308 full and partial laborers, they planted a total of 939 mu of early wheat and 9,989.6 mu of replanted wheat, with wheat fields accounting for 60% of the total land. They achieved meticulous farming, plowing at least once, harrowing once, and raking once, with an average application of 35 loads of manure per mu. This time, the full and partial labor of women was greatly utilized, resulting in the emergence of many model working women. Zhang Chengying, a military family member in Baijian, 42 years old, plowed two mu of land in one day, and 12-year-old girl Wei Xiao'e plowed eight mu of land in four days. Qin Aixiang, a woman from Beiyan, whose husband is at war, does not rely on preferential treatment and relies entirely on herself for all plowing, manure spreading, and sowing. In Baijian, 23 women learned to plow and four women learned to sow wheat, greatly increasing women's confidence in labor.

### 晋城五区  总结检查种麦

    晋城五区
    总结检查种麦
    【本报太岳二日电】晋城五区于廿一日全区村干部会议上检查总结秋种。全区已种麦八万七千九百五十八亩，尚有二万三千九百余亩正在赶种中，可比往年多种三万四千四百九十三亩。这次各村均将男女老少组织起来，按劳力分工下地，山头村是全劳力担粪做重活，妇女儿童盘茬腾地，老汉犁地摇耧。其次干部确实起了带头作用，水东村开始种时怕虫攻，谁也不想先种，干部采用黑矾杀除虫害，首先种上，大家也就跟着种起来。在畜力缺乏的村子，干部设法组织了镪犁犁地，或人拉耧下种，金村等村每村都组织一百多镪犁犁地，并实行组与组村与村变工，调剂人畜力，所以绝大多数村子都能种上了。但也有个别村子，领导上对种麦抓得不紧，放任自流，如府城村感到畜力困难，但不组织镪犁，听任群众等待牲口，结果没牲口户到现在还没种上；其他北石店、赵庄等村各顾各吃了亏，现才种上十分之五、六。
    【本报太岳二日电】阳城四区三联基点村、白涧、北燕、固隆、四侯、文敏等村，初步总结秋种工作，从十月九日到二十三日十四天中，依靠男女全劳力三百零八人，共种早麦九百三十九亩，回茬麦九千九百八十九亩六分，麦地占全部土地百分之六十。作到精耕细作，至少犁一遍盘一遍耙一遍，每亩平均上粪三十五担。此次大大发挥了妇女全半劳力作用，因此出现了不少模范劳动妇女。白涧军属女妇张丞英，四十二岁，一天犁地二亩，十二岁的女孩魏小娥，四天犁地八亩，北燕妇女秦爱香，男人参战，家里不靠优待，所有犁地、匀粪、下种完全靠自己。白涧有二十三个妇女学会犁地，四个妇女学会种麦，大大提高了妇女劳动信心。
