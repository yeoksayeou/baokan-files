    South Boundary Township Achieves Ideological Breakthrough;
    All Cattle and Donkeys Put to Work
    [This newspaper, Xiyang News] During the autumn plowing organization in South Boundary Township, the masses discovered a certain ideology: households with donkeys were unwilling to harness them, fearing injury to the donkeys' shoulders; households without donkeys were unwilling to use donkeys for plowing, complaining about the poor quality of the work. After discovering this ideology, the masses were allowed to start a discussion. For example, Wang Junyi said, "I planted eighteen mu of land last year, all plowed with donkeys. In spring, the seedlings emerged fully. This year, there are still several mu unplowed, and the seedling emergence this spring is much worse." After such discussions cleared everyone's thinking, everyone began to take action. Li Chengke immediately organized two teams of donkeys and one team of cattle in his group to plow the land. Wang Zhixian, who had two inferior donkeys, assigned his two children to them, and they also started plowing. Zhang Guicheng assigned his own donkey to his son, and they are also plowing. The entire village has 3,380 mu of land, and all 40 teams of cattle and donkeys have been put to work, and are now rushing to plow, fighting against the frozen ground.

    南界都打通思想
    牛驴全部上套
    【本报昔阳讯】南界都村在组织秋耕中，群众发现一种思想，有驴户不上套，怕搬了驴膀，没驴户不愿用驴耕，嫌耕的劣。发现这种思想后，便让群众展开讨论，如王俊义说：“我去年种地十八亩，都是用驴耕的，今春捉住了全苗，还有几亩没耕完，今春捉苗差的多。”经过这样讨论打通了大家的思想，大家这才全部行动起来，李成科立即在自己的组里组织了两犋驴一犋牛去耕地。王之贤有两个劣驴，配了他两个小孩，也开始耕地。张贵成把自己的一个驴配自己的儿子，也在进行耕地。全村有地三千三百八十亩，牛驴四十犋，全部上了套，现正在抢耕，向天冻作斗争。（忙小、志鸿、喜桂）
