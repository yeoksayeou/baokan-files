    Qingcao Ao Families Calculate Grain Harvest
    Save and Economize to Fill the Gap
    [This newspaper, Ping Shun News] Due to the drought this year in Qingcao Ao, in the Third District, late planting, and recent wind, frost, and poor autumn harvest, a serious disaster situation has been created. However, the masses are still numb to the disaster during the autumn harvest and autumn planting, and there are still unthrifty ideas such as "eat well this autumn whether we harvest or not." On the night of October 16th, a meeting of agricultural association members was held to discuss the harvest, planting, assess the year's yield, examine their own autumn harvest of grain, and calculate how long it could be eaten. For example, the nine households of Shi Huaixin, Shi Huaili, etc. (three households with better harvests, three middle households, and three of the worst households) have a total of 37 people and 76.6 mu of land. They harvested a total of 34.5 shi of coarse grains. If each person consumes one jin of coarse grains per day (with vegetables), it would only last four and a half months. There would still be a shortage of four months of grain until the wheat harvest next May. After this calculation, the numbness towards the disaster was broken. Labor hero Shi Yuechang said: "I originally planned to sew a new quilt this year. Based on this calculation, there is a great shortage of grain. I dare not sew a quilt. I will save these two zhang of cloth to exchange for grain to get through the disaster." Everyone unanimously discussed the methods of combining autumn planting with disaster preparedness: 1. Expand the wheat fields to have an early connection next May; 2. Send people out to buy bran and make more persimmon bran fried noodles; 3. Accumulate more wild vegetables to prepare for the disaster; 4. Cooperatives collect cloth from the masses to exchange for grain; 5. Cut willow branches to prepare to weave baskets to exchange for grain; 6. Save food and be thrifty, without waste. The cooperative has now exchanged 1,600 jin of grain with cloth.

    青草凹家家算收粮
    省吃俭用补窟窿
    【本报平顺讯】三区青草凹因今年天旱种地迟，又加近来风霜秋禾歉收，造成了目前严重灾情，但群众在秋收秋耕中对灾荒仍麻痹，还有“收不收吃一秋”等不节约思想。十月十六日夜，召开农会员会议，讨论收耕评年景，检查自己秋收打的粮食，计算能吃多长时间。如史怀信、史怀理等九户（收成较好的三户，中等三户，最坏三户）共有人三十七口，有地七十六亩六分，共收三十四石五斗粗粮，每口平均九石三，每天每人就以吃一斤粗粮（配吃菜）来计算，只能吃四个半月，到明年五月麦收还缺四个月粮食。经这样算帐，打破了对灾荒的麻痹思想，劳动英雄史悦昌说：“我原计划今年缝上个新被子，这样计算起来，粮食缺少很多，不敢缝被子啦，省下这两丈多布叫换粮食度灾用。”大家一致讨论出秋耕结合备荒办法：一、扩大麦田明年五月早接嘴；二、抽人出外购买糠，多造柿糠炒面；三、多积野菜，准备度灾；四、合作社收集群众布，往回换粮食；五、割条子准备编子箩头往回换粮食；六、省吃俭用不浪费。合作社现已用布换回粮食一千六百斤。（本中、俊科）
