　　A Great and Simple Person
  　Impressions of Stalin
    Yakolev
    The author of this article, Yakolev, is an aircraft designer who has been awarded the honorary title of Hero of Socialist Labor of the Soviet Union and has received six medals. He is currently the Deputy People's Commissar of the Soviet Aviation Industry. This article is excerpted from a chapter of his book "Memoirs."

    In his personal life, Stalin was exceptionally frugal in everything.
    His clothing was very simple: before the war, he usually wore a special gray uniform, which was not really a uniform, but a well-fitting casual suit made of the same gray material, with soft and light leather boots.
    When talking, he always walked gently in the hall. He listened to the other person speaking, rarely interrupting, and always let them finish.
    I saw that in government meetings, people often handed him notes, and he always read them carefully, folded them up neatly, and put them in his pocket.
    He paid close attention to every one of these notes.
    Stalin was intolerant of superficial observations, and unforgiving of those who did not grasp the essence of a problem when discussing it. He would give them sharp criticism, so that they would never dare to speak lightly in front of him again.
    Taking things seriously was a prominent characteristic of Stalin.
    I encountered the following type of conversation several times: for example, when giving a task to a person in charge, that person would say:
    ——Comrade Stalin, the period is too short, this work is difficult.
    Comrade Stalin would reply:
    ——We are talking about difficult things here. It is precisely because the matter is difficult that we have asked you to come. You had better talk about what help you need to do this, and complete everything that should be done on time.
    Stalin liked people to answer his questions without hesitation, directly, and accurately. Often, people who went to see him for the first time were afraid to answer his questions immediately, and would try hard to conceive an answer to avoid getting into an embarrassing situation. I was like this at first, and before answering Comrade Stalin's questions, I would awkwardly look at the window or the ceiling.
    Comrade Stalin would laugh and say:
    ——Looking at the ceiling is useless, there is nothing written there. You had better look straight ahead and say what you want to say. That is the only requirement for you.
    Sometimes I felt it difficult to answer his questions immediately—I didn't know if Comrade Stalin agreed with my answer, or if what I was going to say would please him.
    Seeing this situation, he emphasized:
    ——Please just answer according to what you think. Don't try to say things that please me. Don't talk to me like that. If you try to guess my wishes when you speak, then our conversation will be of little benefit. Don't think that if what you say does not match my opinion, it will be bad. You are a specialist, and we talk to you not only to give you our teachings, but also to receive your teachings.
    Comrade Stalin said when commenting on a leader who had been removed from his job:
    ——What is wrong with him? The bad thing is that when answering a question, he first observes the expression on people's faces: he tries to guess how to answer so as not to get into an embarrassing situation, and how to say things to please people. This kind of person will do bad things, even though he does not want to do bad things at heart.
    Once, Comrade Stalin said:
    ——If you firmly believe that your own opinion is correct, and can prove that it is correct, then you should not take into account anyone else's opinion, but act according to your own views and your conscience.
    Stalin did not tolerate illogical writing. When he received documents with incoherent sentences, he would get angry.
    ——What an illiterate person! But if you criticize him, he will immediately say that he comes from a worker-peasant background to explain his illiteracy. This explanation is incorrect. This is due to a lack of civilization and carelessness. Especially in national defense, it is not allowed to use a worker-peasant background to explain one's lack of education, lack of technical preparation, rudeness, or incomprehension. Because the enemy will never yield to us because of our social origin. Precisely because we are workers and peasants, we should be thoroughly prepared in all matters, no less than the enemy.
    Some officers in the Red Army attempted to compensate for their lack of knowledge of work, especially complex combat technology, with personal bravery and fearlessness. Therefore, Stalin often said:
    ——Many of us always boast of their courage. But if you are not proficient in combat technology, relying on courage alone is useless. It is not enough to have only courage and hatred of the enemy. Everyone knows that the American Indians were very brave, but they were powerless to oppose the white people armed with firearms with their bows and arrows.
    When a small group of people were solving individual problems, Stalin always allowed everyone to fully express their opinions. He sometimes sought the opinions of certain people before making a conclusion. At this time, he would hand someone a piece of paper and a pencil and say:
    ——Please write it down.
    Then he would personally dictate a document.
    Once, I also wrote at his dictation. I knew he paid close attention to this matter, so I strained all my mental powers to ensure that there were no grammatical errors. While dictating, he would occasionally come up to me and look over my shoulder to see how I was writing. He suddenly stopped, looked at what I had written, and then took my hand holding the pencil and added a comma.
    Another time, I did not construct a sentence perfectly. Stalin said:
    ——Why put the subject after the object? You have placed the subject a little awkwardly! It should be like this!——and immediately corrected it.
    After this incident, I reviewed Russian grammar very carefully.
    Comrade Stalin believed that expressing one's thoughts correctly and fluently was of great significance.
    If a person cannot express his meaning fluently and correctly, then his thinking will also be chaotic, and how can he do the entrusted things well?
    Stalin's own work and the work of those around him were exceptionally precise.
    Once, Stalin summoned me and gave me an important task. I promised to carry out this task.
    Stalin read:
    ——This matter is very urgent and must be completed quickly, so we have decided to entrust you with this task. Do you need any help?
    I said:
    ——I don't need any help, I have everything I need.
    ——Very good! If you need anything, don't be shy, feel free to call and ask for help.
    I immediately thought of something:
    ——Comrade Stalin, I have a request! But the problem is very small, perhaps not worth bothering you!
    ——Please speak.
    ——When carrying out this task, I often have to go to various airports, but the factory's transportation is not very good. I need two "ML" brand cars.
    ——Only two cars, nothing else?
    ——Yes, nothing else. I have everything else there.
    Then he let me go back.
    I went straight back to the factory, and as soon as I arrived at the factory, the deputy director greeted me and said:
    Comrade Yakolev, the People's Commissariat of the Automobile Industry just called and asked us to send someone with a receipt to collect two "ML" brand cars.
    And asked to sign the receipt immediately. Forty minutes later, two brand new "ML" brand cars had already been driven to the factory.
    A little over an hour later, Comrade Molotov's secretary called me and asked if we had received the cars. This was originally to check the implementation of the work. I therefore thought: This is truly Comrade Stalin's work style, everyone should work like this! (To be continued)

### 伟大而质朴的人物　斯大林印象

　　伟大而质朴的人物
  　斯大林印象
    雅可福烈夫
    本文作者雅可福烈夫是荣膺苏联最光荣的社会主义劳动英雄称号，并得过六枚勋章的飞机构造家，现在他是苏联航空工业人民委员会副委员长。本文摘自他所著“生平回忆”中的一章。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——编者    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    斯大林在他的个人生活方面，一切都是异常俭朴的。
    他的服装很朴素：在战前，通常是穿着一种特式灰色军服，其实，也并不是军服，而是很合身的便装，裤子也是用这种灰色材料制成的，皮靴绵软而轻便。
    在谈话的时候，他总是在厅内轻轻踱着步。他听着对方说话，很少打断对方的讲话，一直让他讲完为止。
    我看见在政府机关会议上，常有人递给他纸条，而他每次都把纸条阅完，好好摺起来放在衣袋里。
    他对于每次这种纸条都是很注意的。
    斯大林对于浮浅观察问题的态度是容忍不住的，对于那些讨论一种问题时表现不明问题实质的人，毫不宽恕，定给以锋利的批评，因此这些人当着他的面永远再也不敢轻易说话了。
    认真办事是斯大林的显著特点。
    我遇见了好几次这样谈话的情形：比如给负责人员一种任务时，那人说道：
    ——斯大林同志，期间太短了，这工作是困难的。
    斯大林同志回答道：
    ——我们这里所谈的都是困难事情。正因为事情困难，所以才请你来。你最好说说作这件事需要什么帮助，并将应作的一切都按时完成。
    斯大林欢喜人们毫不犹豫地、直截了当、确切回答他的问题。常有初次到他那里去的人，总是不敢马上回答他问的问题，而要极力构思答案，以免陷于窘境。我起初也是这样，在回答斯大林同志的问题之前，也曾窘促的不是望望窗户，就是看看天花板。
    斯大林同志笑道：
    ——您看天花板是白看的，那里什么也没有写着。您最好照直看，直说你想要说的话。这就是对你的唯一要求。
    有时我觉得骓于马上回答他所提的问题——不知斯大林同志是否赞成我的回答，我要说的话是否使他高兴。
    他看出了这种情形就着重说道：
    ——请你只照你所想的回答就够了。不要努力说使我高兴的话。同我谈话不要这样。如果你要猜想我的心愿来讲话，那么我们的谈话就很少益处。您不要以为您说的话如果不合我的意思，就会不好。你是专门家，我们同你谈话不只是使你受到我们的教益，而且也使我们受到你的教益。
    斯大林同志在评论一位被解除工作的领导人时说道：
    ——他有什么坏处呢？坏处就是在回答某个问题时，首先是观察颜色：极力猜度，需要怎样回答，才不致陷于窘境，怎样说才可以取悦于人。这样的人会大坏事情，虽然他本心不愿作坏事。
    有一次斯大林同志说道：
    ——如果您坚信您自己的意见正确，并且能证明是正确的时候，那您就根本不要顾及任何人的意见，而是要本着您的见解和您的天良去行动。
    斯大林不容忍文理不通的现象。当他接到字句不通的文件时。他就气愤起来。
    ——真是文理不通的人！但要责备他一下，他马上就会说他是工农出身，借以解释自己文盲的原因。这种解释是不正确的。这是不受文明和粗心大意的原因。特别在国防事业中更不允许拿工农出身来解释自己的教育程度不足，来解释自己没有技术准备、粗鲁或不通事理。因为敌人绝不会因我们的社会出身而向我们让步。正因为我们是工农，我们更应当在一切问题上都有周详完备的准备，毫不亚于敌人才对。
    红军军官中某些人，企图以个人的勇敢和不怕危险的精神来抵偿自己对于工作，特别是对于复杂的战斗技术认识上之不足，因此斯大林常说：
    ——我们有很多人总是夸耀自己的勇气。可是若不精通战斗技术，而只靠胆量是毫无用处的。只有勇敢，只有仇恨敌人，是不够的。谁都知道，美洲的印第安人是很勇敢的，可是他们用自己的弓箭来反对以枪械武装起来的白种人是毫无力量的。
    在同一小部分当事人解决个别问题时，斯大林总是让所有的人尽情发表自己的意见。他有时也征求某些人的意见，然后才做结论。这时他拿一张纸，一枝铅笔递给某人说道：
    ——请你写吧。
    于是他就亲自口授一种文件。
    有一次我也在他的口授之下来写了。我知道他很注意这件事情，所以我紧张起全部脑力，竭力使文法没有丝毫错误。他一面口授，一面不时的来到我跟前，从我肩上看看写的怎样。他忽然站住，看看我写的以后，就握住我执铅笔的手，点了一个逗点。
    还有一次，有一句，我没有完全造好。斯大林说道：
    ——为什么把这主词写在宾词后边呢？您把主词安置得有点不顺当吧！应当这样才对！——并马上给改正了。
    过了这回事情以后，我又极注意的温习了一次俄文文法。
    斯大林同志认为正确通顺地表达出自己的思想是有很大意义的。
    如果一个人不能把自己的意思通顺、正确的表达出来，那他的思索也就同样是杂乱无章的，那他怎能办好所委托的事情呢？
    斯大林本人的工作以及周围人员的工作都是异常精确的。
    有一次斯大林召我去，给了我一个重要任务。我答应执行这个任务。
    斯大林念道：
    ——这件事很紧急，要火速完成，所以我们决定把这件事委托您去作。您需什么帮助吗？
    我说道：
    ——什么帮助也不需要，一切需要的东西我都有。
    ——很好！若是需要什么，不要客气，尽可打电话来要求帮助。
    我当下想起一件事情：
    ——斯大林同志，我有一个请求！不过问题很小，或许不值得烦劳您！
    ——请说吧。
    ——在执行这个任务时，要常常到各飞机场里去，可是工厂的交通工具不很好。我需要两辆“ＭＬ”牌汽车。
    ——只要两辆汽车，再不要什么吗？
    ——是的，再不要什么。其余一切我那里都有。
    随后就放我回去了。
    我一直回往工厂去，刚一到工厂的时候，副厂长就迎着说道：
    雅可福烈夫同志，方才由汽车工业人民委员部打来电话，叫派人带着收据去领两辆“ＭＬ”牌汽车。
    并要马上在收据上签字。经过四十分钟，两辆崭新的“ＭＬ”牌汽车已经开到工厂了。
    又过一点钟的工夫，莫洛托夫同志的秘书给我打了电话，问我们是否领到了汽车。这原来是检查执行工作。我因而想到：这真是斯大林同志的工作作风，大家都应该这样工作才对！（未完）
