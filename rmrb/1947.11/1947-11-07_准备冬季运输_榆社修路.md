    Preparing for Winter Transportation
    Yu She Repairs Roads
    [This newspaper, Taihang, 4th dispatch] Yu She is repairing roads to prepare for winter transportation. In the past, the roads, both main and small, in the county were severely damaged by the war, making it very inconvenient for the masses to travel and transport goods. A repair was done before last winter, but because it was started too late, it soon froze, so it had to be put on hold. Learning from this lesson, they are seizing the time before the autumn harvest to first work on the stonework and repair the bridges and stone cliffs. After the autumn harvest, everyone will be mobilized to level high spots and fill in low spots, and finally complete the work. The plan is for the county to repair four major roads for trucks: Zuoquan-Yu She, Yu She-Wu Xiang, Xiangyuan-Yu She, and Wu Xiang-Hongshui, and to connect to the main road from Pinging to Changzhi in the east, so as to facilitate the exchange of materials with friendly neighboring counties and solve the masses' difficulty in obtaining coal. To the west, the main road from Yu She city to Yun Cuo town to Shi Pan (Wu Xiang) will be repaired to facilitate exports to and from this area. The county is responsible for these four roads. The district-to-district and village-to-village small roads are the responsibility of each district and village. The stonework on the Zuo Yu road began on September 20, concentrating 38 people, and was expected to take half a month, but it has now been completed in only ten days. The stonework on other roads is being rushed.

    准备冬季运输
    榆社修路
    【本报太行四日电】榆社修路，准备冬季运输。该县的大道小路，过去因战争摧残破坏严重，群众来往运输非常不便。去年冬前曾修补过一次，但由于动手过迟，不久就上了冻，只好搁起来。今年接受这个教训，在秋收前抓紧时间，先动石工，把桥梁石崖先修好，收秋后全部动员，削高垫低，最后完成。计划全县修大车道四条：左（权）榆（社）、榆（社）武（乡）、襄（垣）榆（社）、武（乡）洪（水），和东面平定至长治的大路沟通，便于和内地友邻各县交流物资，解决群众烧煤困难。往西要修通榆社城至云簇镇至石盘（武乡）的大路，和这地来往出口。这四条路由县负责。其他区与区、村与村的小路，由各区村负责。左榆路石工，九月二十日即开始集中三十八人，预计需半月，现在仅十天已竣工。其他各路，石工正在赶修中。
