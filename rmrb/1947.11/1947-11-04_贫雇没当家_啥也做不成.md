    Poor and Hired Laborers Not in Charge
    Nothing Can Be Accomplished
    [This Newspaper Report] Since the emancipation movement last year in Dongyangguan, the third district of Licheng, the masses, in order to plant the roots of wealth, spontaneously organized eleven small cooperatives. Within half a year, eight gradually came to a standstill, leaving three half-dead. After a ten-day inspection, the main reason was that the poor and hired laborers did not seize power, and the district and village cooperatives failed to help solve the problems in a timely manner. In the Lalang Lane small cooperative, there were three rich peasant households with 80,000 yuan of capital, ten middle peasant households with 196,584 yuan, and four poor peasant households with 28,500 yuan. After its organization, the rich peasants and small merchants seized power. The rich peasant Zhao Bingding became the manager, and within three or four months, 7,000 yuan went missing without any explanation. Lou Qi'er embezzled over 100,000 yuan in foreign currency during three trips to Dongyangguan to buy cloth. The workers hired by the cooperative were constantly sent by these power holders to work in their fields. Zhao Youkui was responsible for selling cloth and earning wages for everyone, but he sold cloth for himself. These problems continued to occur, and the masses were dissatisfied but dared not speak out, so they withdrew their shares one after another. Thus, the small cooperative was in a state of half-dead. After discovering these problems, the leadership went deep among the poor and hired laborers to discuss the reasons. Tian Guanglin said that these people did not have the interests of the masses at heart. Li Futin said that the main reason was that they themselves had not become masters. After reaching a consensus, they ousted the feudal landlord Zhao Bingding and Lou Qi'er, elected Li Yiting as the manager, and discussed the production plan for this winter. Everyone happily said that after the autumn harvest and autumn plowing, they would immediately switch to sideline production. (Si Kui, Shu Tian, Xiu Qi, Shu Chang, San Long)

    贫雇没当家
    啥也做不成
    【本报讯】黎城三区东阳关，自去年翻身运动后，群众为了栽富根，自动组织了小型合作社十一个，在半年中逐渐停顿了八个，半死不活留下三个，经过十天的检查，里边的主要原因，是贫雇没有掌了权，再加上区村合作社没有及时帮助解决问题。拉浪巷小型社，有富农三户资金八万元，中农十户十九万六千五百八十四元，贫农四户二万八千五百元，当时组织起后，被这富农及小商人掌了权，富农赵丙丁当了经理，三、四个月内发生无故短钱七千元。娄七儿到东阳关买布三次，贪污洋十万余元，社内雇的工人不断给这些掌权人到地里做活。赵有魁负责卖布赚的大家工资，可是给自己卖布。这些问题不断发生，群众不满又不敢说，即纷纷抽股。这样小型社就处在半死不活状态，发现这些问题后，领导上深入贫雇讨论原因。田广林说，这些人没有为群众服务心眼。李福廷说，主要自己没有当了主人。思想一致后，即挤出封建地主赵丙丁、娄七儿，选出李仪廷为经理，并讨论了今冬的生产计划，大家都高兴的说，秋收秋耕完毕，即马上转到副业生产。（思魁、书田、秀奇、树长、三隆）
