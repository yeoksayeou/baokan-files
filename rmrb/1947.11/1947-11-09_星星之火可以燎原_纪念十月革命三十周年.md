    A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire
    —In Commemoration of the 30th Anniversary of the October Revolution
    As we celebrate the 30th anniversary of the October Revolution, the oppressed people of the world and all enlightened humanity hold brighter and more fervent hopes than ever before; a stronger will to fight the imperialist reactionaries, and a greater confidence in the inevitable victory of the cause of human liberation.
    The enemies of mankind, the imperialists, and the pessimists who are actually dependent on the imperialist world, have always put on a frightening face since the first day after the revolution of November 7, 1917, exaggerating the invincible and immortal power of imperialism and other reactionary forces, and asserting the inevitable failure of the so-called "isolated" and "young" socialist cause. The first reason for this propaganda, of course, was to systematically, continuously, and pervasively poison the fighting spirit of the oppressed humanity, causing it to wither under the siege of a man-made dark atmosphere. Another reason, however, stemmed from the instinctive fanatic confidence of the reactionary class and its instinctive underestimation of the power of the people. Thus, while the propaganda of the reactionary class created errors for some of the people, it also inevitably created errors for themselves. In fact, the development of historical events in the thirty years after the October Revolution has never conformed to the blueprint designed by these reactionary engineers. The imperialists' struggle against the first socialist country in human history has gone through several different periods: before the end of 1920, the main method of the imperialist countries (Germany, Britain, France, Japan, the United States, Poland, etc.) was armed intervention. The imperialists, in alliance with the counter-revolutionaries of old Russia, attempted to fundamentally eliminate the Soviet Union during the days when it was just born and encountering various serious difficulties. Their attempt was unanimously considered by all bourgeois experts as inevitably successful. However, after three years of cruel struggle from 1918 to 1920, it was not the Soviet people who failed, but the counter-revolutionaries of old Russia, the counter-revolutionary interventionists from various countries, and the experts from various countries who predicted the failure of the Soviet Union. From 1921 to 1941, the imperialists mainly changed to "peaceful" methods, that is, diplomatic, economic, and propaganda isolation, blockade, and attack, espionage and sabotage from inside and outside, and, from the September 18th Incident in 1931, especially from the Munich Agreement in September 1938, gradually leading the new war towards the Soviet Union. But the Soviet Union, after serious struggles, overcame various difficulties and conspiracies, winning twenty years to build and consolidate itself. All the progress of the Soviet Union during this period was still something that the vast majority of bourgeois leaders and experts were unwilling to believe. Therefore, in June 1941, the German and Italian imperialist groups, headed by Hitler, launched a large-scale offensive against the Soviet Union, overestimating their own strength and underestimating the strength of the Soviet Union. This offensive was also declared "irresistible" by the vast majority of counter-revolutionary experts. The imperialists of the Hitler group believed that they could conquer the Soviet Union. The American and British imperialists and reactionaries in various countries believed that the Soviet Union and Hitler would be both defeated and injured, and that they would benefit from sitting on the mountain and watching the tigers fight. But this fierce war, which lasted for four years, did not satisfy the wishes of the former, nor did it satisfy the wishes of the latter. The great anti-fascist war that determined the fate of mankind ended victoriously with the decisive blow given by the Soviet Union. Thus, when the Soviet people, all oppressed people of the world, and all enlightened humanity celebrate the 30th anniversary of the October Revolution, the strength and prestige of the Soviet Union have reached an unprecedented height.
    But the great significance of the thirty years of the victory of the October Revolution is not limited to this. The October Revolution opened the first breach in imperialist rule on one-sixth of the world's land, and erected the first lighthouse of a socialist paradise. In these thirty years, while the socialist Soviet Union eliminated the system of human exploitation, thereby eliminating poverty, unemployment, and crises, as well as barbaric phenomena such as the powerlessness of the masses, the greedy arrogance of financial oligarchs, and national oppression, and advanced forward on an unprecedented scale and speed as a backward country, capitalism rapidly corrupted and became reactionary. Wealth became increasingly concentrated, hunger became increasingly prevalent, severe crises were encountered time and time again, the plague of fascism spread from one country to another, and wars broke out in one place after another. Since any skilled doctor of capitalism is completely unable to mend the cracks opened by the October Revolution, and is completely unable to alleviate the corruption and reaction of the old world itself, he is also completely unable to stop the people of various countries from continuing to open new cracks in the old world along the path opened up by the October Revolution. Today, thirty years after the October Revolution, the world imperialist front has not only been breached in the Soviet Union long ago, but has also been breached in the entire Eastern Europe, and has been breached in China. In Southern Europe (Greece, Italy, France), Southeast Asia (Vietnam, Indonesia, India, etc.) and other places, it is also being breached. The most belligerent fascist countries have been overthrown, the entire capitalist system has been greatly weakened, and the light of the October Revolution lighthouse is shining on an increasingly vast area. The more they face this bright situation, the more those aging, trembling, and flustered imperialists hate the Soviet Union and the people of various countries, and the more they rely on the most corrupt and reactionary vermin in various countries, thus further arousing the awareness and righteous indignation of the people of various countries. In short, the old order of capitalism has lost its vitality and hope, and has become increasingly broken and rotten day by day. Every event in every corner of every day, whether it represents progress or reaction, is repeatedly educating mankind. Today, only the world socialist movement represented by the October Revolution, and the New Democratic movement, as a component of the world socialist movement, can help the people of various countries achieve liberation and justice, can resist the corruption and reaction of the old capitalist world, and can finally eliminate capitalism and realize the bright future of mankind.
    The October Revolution is the victory of science, and the name of this science is Marxism-Leninism. The reason why Marxism-Leninism is a science is because it always calls on mankind to recognize the true face of the world, to recognize the essence of things, and not to be deceived by various confusing, unfounded, and pretentious false appearances used to intimidate. Precisely because of this, it can guide the Soviet people, with the conviction of inevitable victory, to overthrow the seemingly powerful Tsarist rule, to overcome seemingly insurmountable difficulties, to build socialism; and to defeat the armed intervention of the great powers and Hitler's offensive, to defend socialism. Contrary to Marxism-Leninism, imperialism and reactionaries in various countries rely on religious superstition on the ideological front. The name of this religious superstition, according to what Comrade Mao Zedong said in his conversation with American journalist Anna Louise Strong in September 1946, is "paper tiger." Strong recorded this conversation that started with the atomic bomb:
    Mao said: "The atomic bomb is a paper tiger, looks terrible, but is actually not terrible. The real power does not lie in the reactionaries, but in the people. All reactionaries are paper tigers. Who possessed the real power in Russia before the February Revolution in 1917? On the surface, it seemed that the Tsar had power; but what kind of power was that? When the February Revolution broke out, the Tsar collapsed at once. The ultimate power belonged to the Soviets of workers, peasants and soldiers. The Tsar was just a paper tiger. Didn't people think that Hitler was very powerful before? But history tells us that he was just a paper tiger. Mussolini was the same, Japanese imperialism was the same, Chiang Kai-shek is also a paper tiger, and the American reactionaries are also paper tigers. People seem to think that they are very powerful. The reactionaries in China once used this 'power' of the American reactionaries to intimidate the Chinese people. Facts will prove that they do not have lasting power. The Chinese people, the American people, and the people of all countries have lasting and powerful power."
    But as we said at the beginning, what the imperialists use to intimidate the people and unite themselves is precisely this fetishism for paper tigers. Although the imperialists' paper tigers have been punctured countless times, they still exist by relying on the prestige of paper tigers, because the imperialists cannot have other better weapons, and although the paper tigers have been punctured countless times, they do not automatically become useless. Facts are never that simple. Although the imperialists are all paper tigers, the people's understanding of this truth must go through various concrete, firsthand experiences. Just as the rule of imperialism is bound to perish, every one of its positions must be seized through concrete and meticulously organized struggles. The communiqué of the Warsaw Conference of the nine communist parties in Europe, published in early October, emphasized: "The main danger for the working class now is underestimating its own strength and overestimating the strength of the imperialist camp." Josip Broz Tito's speech on September 30 also pointed out that the main errors in the activities of the people's fronts in the past lay in "insufficient determination and perseverance in organizing armed struggle, lack of confidence in the power of the people, lack of heroic leadership and a clear program." The reason why this situation occurs indicates that the paper tiger is still able to temporarily deceive some people, even some vanguards of the working class. The history of the struggles of the people of various countries in the thirty years since the October Revolution, in one sense, is the history of the struggle of the science of Marxism-Leninism against the paper tigers of the reactionary forces. Today, the consciousness of mankind has risen to an unprecedented level, but it is still far from reaching the level it should be; the market for paper tigers has shrunk to an unprecedented level, but it is still far from reaching the level it should be. To use the historical lessons of the great October Revolution to awaken the broad masses of the people in various countries, to overcome the danger of underestimating their own strength and overestimating the strength of the enemy, and to wage a more heroic but down-to-earth struggle against the reactionary forces in various countries, so as to completely eliminate world imperialism and reactionaries in various countries that endanger the security of mankind, this is today's task.
    The Chinese people are now engaged in a great revolutionary war, the purpose of which is to overthrow the rule of American imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek in China. This war has already achieved great victories and will continue to be victorious until all enemies are overthrown and a new China is established. On this day of celebrating the 30th anniversary of the October Revolution, the Chinese people should believe that our days of hardship can be completely overcome, and that any difficulties can be overcome. We are fully confident that we can completely overthrow the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group, which has received the assistance of American imperialism. We are not isolated. All anti-imperialist countries and people in the world are our friends. But we emphasize self-reliance, and we can rely on the strength of our own organization to overthrow our enemies. The Chinese nation is a fighting nation. The Russians have created the great achievements of defeating imperialism and domestic reactionaries since the October Revolution, and the Chinese can also create them. The next few years will certainly prove this point.
    "A single spark can start a prairie fire," and now is the time to start a prairie fire!

    星星之火可以燎原
    ——纪念十月革命三十周年
    在庆祝十月革命三十周年的时候，全世界被压迫的人民和一切觉悟的人类，比以往任何时候都怀抱更光明更热烈的希望。对于帝国主义反动势力更坚强的战斗意志，和对于人类解放事业必然胜利的更伟大的信心。
    人类的敌人帝国主义者，以及实际上依附于帝国主义世界的悲观主义者，从一九一七年十一月七日革命后的第一天起，就总是做出吓人的面孔，夸耀帝国主义和其他反动势力之无敌的和不朽的强大，断言所谓“孤立”的“幼小”的社会主义事业之必然失败。这种宣传的第一个原因，当然是为了有计划地每天不断和无孔不入地毒化被压迫人类的奋斗精神，使之在人造的黑暗空气的重围高压之下，陷于萎靡。其另一个原因，却是出于反动阶级的本能式的狂热自信及其对于人民力量的本能式的估计不足。这样，反动阶级的宣传，在一方面既然造成了一部分人民的错误，在另一方面也不可免的造成了他们自己的错误。事实上，十月革命后三十年间历史事变的发展，从来也没有符合于这些反动工程师们所设计的图样。帝国主义者对于人类史上第一个社会主义国家的斗争，曾经经历过几个不同的时期：在一九二○年年底以前，帝国主义国家（德、英、法、日、美、波等）的主要方法是武装干涉，帝国主义者们联合旧俄的反革命派，曾经企图趁苏联方才诞生和遭遇各种严重困难的日子根本消灭苏联，而他们的企图，是曾经毫无例外地被一切资产阶级专家们认为必然会顺利实现的。但是，一九一八年至一九二○年，三年残酷斗争的结果，失败的不是苏联人民，而是旧俄的反革命派，是各国的反革命干涉者，和各国预言苏联失败的专家。自从一九二一年到一九四一年，帝国主义者们主要的改用了“和平”的方法，这就是在外交上、经济上和宣传上孤立、封锁和打击的方法，从内部外部实行间谍破坏的方法，和从一九三一年九一八事变起，特别是从一九三八年九月慕尼黑协定起，逐步将新战争引向苏联的方法。但是苏联经过严重的奋斗，战胜了各种困难和阴谋，赢得了建设自己和巩固自己的二十年时间，苏联在这个期间的一切进步，仍然是绝大多数资产阶级领袖和专家们所不愿相信的，因此一九四一年六月，以希特勒为首的德意帝国主义集团，又在过高估计自己力量，过低估计苏联力量的情况下，发动了对于苏联的大举进攻，并且这个进攻，又被绝大多数反革命专家宣布为“不可抵抗”。希特勒集团的帝国主义者，相信可以征服苏联。美英帝国主义者及各国反动派，则相信苏联与希特勒将两败俱伤，相信自己将因坐山观虎斗而得渔翁之利。但是这个进行了四年之久的激烈战争，既没有满足前者的愿望，也没有满足后者的愿望。人类命运所有的伟大反法西斯战争，是以苏联所给决定性的打击而胜利地结束了。这样，当苏联人民，全世界一切被压迫人民和一切觉悟人类，庆祝十月革命三十周年的时候，苏联的力量和威信，就达到了空前的高度。
    但是十月革命胜利的三十年其伟大意义还不止此。十月革命在世界六分之一的土地上，打开了帝国主义统治的第一个缺口，竖立了社会主义乐园的第一座灯塔。在这三十年中，当社会主义的苏联，消灭了人剥削人的制度，从而消灭了贫穷、失业、危机。人民大众的无权，财政寡头的贪残骄横，民族间的压迫等等野蛮现象，并以一个落后的国家，以空前未有的规模和速度向前迈进的时候，资本主义却急速地腐化和反动。财富日益集中，饥饿日益普遍，一次又一次地遭遇严重的危机，一国又一国地流行法西斯主义的瘟疫，一处又一处地爆发战争。资本主义的任何高明的医生，既然完全无能来弥缝十月革命所打开的裂口，也完全无能来缓和旧世界本身的腐化和反动，因此也就完全无能来停止各国人民沿着十月革命所开辟的道路，对于旧世界继续打开新的裂口。在十月革命三十年后的今天，世界帝国主义战线，不但在苏联早已被冲破了，而且在整个东欧也已被冲破了，在中国也已被冲破了，在南欧（希腊、意大利、法国）东南亚（越南、印尼、印度等）和其他地方，也正在被冲破着。最好战的法西斯国家是被打倒了，整个资本主义体系，是被大大削弱了，十月革命灯塔的光明，正在照耀着日益广阔的地面。愈是面临着这个光明的形势，那些衰老战栗和手足失措的帝国主义者们，就愈加仇视苏联和各国人民，愈加依赖于各国最腐化最反动的虫豸，因而又愈加激起各国人民的觉悟和义愤。总之，资本主义的旧秩序，已经丧失生命力和希望，已经一天比一天破碎和糜烂了。每天的每个角落的事变，无论是表示进步的或表示反动的，都在反复不断地教育着人类。今天，只有十月革命所代表的世界社会主义运动，以及作为世界社会主义运动之一个组成部分的新民主主义运动，才能够帮助各国人民得到解放和正义，才能够抵抗资本主义旧世界的腐化和反动，才能够最后消灭资本主义，实现人类的光明前途。
    十月革命是科学的胜利，这个科学的名字叫做马克思列宁主义。马克思列宁主义之所以是科学，因为它总是叫人类认识世界的本来面目，认识事物的实质，而不被各种纷纭的、缺乏真实基础的、虚张声势借以吓人的假象所迷惑。正因为如此，它才能引导苏联人民，抱定必胜的信念，推翻似乎是强大的沙皇统治，战胜似乎是不可克服的困难，以建设社会主义；战胜列强武装干涉和希特勒进攻，以保卫社会主义。跟马克思列宁主义相反，帝国主义及各国反动派，在思想战线上，依靠于宗教迷信。这个宗教迷信的名字，按照毛泽东同志在一九四六年九月与美国记者斯特朗女士谈话的说法，就是“纸老虎”。斯特朗女士记述这段由原子弹开头的谈话道：
    毛说：“原子弹是一只纸老虎，看样子可怕，实在并不可怕。真正的力量不在于反动派，而在于人民。所有反动派都是纸老虎，在一九一七年二月革命以前的俄国谁拥有真正的力量？表面上看来是沙皇有力量；但是这叫什么力量呢？二月革命爆发，沙皇就一下子垮台，最后的力量属于工农兵的苏维埃，沙皇不过是一只纸老虎。人们以前不都认为希特勒很有力量吗？但是历史告诉我们：他不过是一只纸老虎，墨索里尼也是如此，日本帝国主义也是如此，蒋介石也是一只纸老虎，美国反动派也是一只纸老虎，人们似乎都以为他们非常强大，中国的反动分子曾经利用美国反动派的这种‘力量’来恐吓中国人民，事实将证明：他们并没有持久的力量，具有持久而强大的力量的是中国人民、美国人民和各国人民”。
    但是如同我们在开头所说，帝国主义者借以恐吓人民和团结自己的，却正是这种对于纸老虎的拜物教。帝国主义者的纸老虎虽经无数次的戳穿，现在却仍然依靠纸老虎的威风而存在，因为帝国主义者不可能有旁的更好的武器，而且尽管纸老虎已经无数次地被戳破，它并不是就自动变得毫无作用了，事实从来不是这样简单的。尽管帝国主义者都是纸老虎，但是人民对于这个真理的理会，却必须经过各种具体的亲历其境的经验。犹如帝国主义的统治，是必然要灭亡的，但是它的每一个阵地，却必须经过具体的精心组织的斗争，才能够夺取一样。十月初发表的欧洲九国共产党华沙会议公报曾经着重指出：“现在工人阶级的主要危险，是过低估计自身的力量与过高估计帝国主义阵营的力量”。九月三十日南斯拉夫总理铁托的演说，也曾同样指出：过去各国人民阵线活动中的主要错误，在于“组织武装斗争的决心和毅力不足，对人民力量缺乏信心，没有英勇的领导和明确的纲领。”这个情形之所以发生，就表示纸老虎是仍然能够暂时迷惑一部分人民，甚至迷惑工人阶级的某些先锋队的。十月革命以来三十年，各国人民斗争的历史，从一种意义上说，也就是马克思列宁主义的科学对于反动势力的纸老虎斗争的历史。今天人类的觉悟是空前高涨了，但还是远没有达到应有的程度；纸老虎的市场是空前缩小了，但也还远没有达到应有的程度。用伟大十月革命的历史教训，来唤起各国广大的人民群众，克服过低估计自己力量与过高估计敌人力量的危险，向各国反动势力作更英勇的但是脚踏实地的斗争，以便彻底消灭危害人类安全的世界帝国主义和各国反动派，这就是今天的任务。
    中国人民现在正在进行伟大的革命战争，其目的是打倒美国帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石在中国的统治。这个战争，业已取得伟大的胜利，必将继续胜利，直到打倒一切敌人，建立一个崭新的中国。当此庆祝十月革命三十年的日子，中国人民应当相信我们苦难的日子是完全能够度过的，什么困难也能克服。获有美国帝国主义援助的蒋介石反动集团，我们完全有把握将其彻底打倒。我们不孤立，全世界一切反帝国主义的国家与人民，都是我们的朋友。但是我们强调自力更生，我们能够依靠我们自己组成的力量，打倒我们的敌人。中国民族是一个能战斗的民族，俄罗斯人在十月革命以来所创造的战胜帝国主义与国内反动派的伟绩，中国人亦能创造出来；今后数年的时间，必能证明这一点。
    “星星之火可以燎原”，现在已是燎原的时候了！
