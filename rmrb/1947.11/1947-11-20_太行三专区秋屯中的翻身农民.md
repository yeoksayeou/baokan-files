　　The autumn grain collection in our district this year was combined with the autumn plowing. From assessment and rice milling to grain delivery, it generally took only five to ten days to complete (some only three days). Moreover, plowing and grain collection were carried out without interfering with each other. The delivery was fast and of good quality, fully demonstrating the liberated peasants' awareness and high enthusiasm for supporting the front lines after the land reform.

　　"Deliver more grain, capture Chiang Kai-shek!"

　　This is the slogan put forward by the liberated peasants of Hongtiguan in Pingshun County. Under the conscious awareness of the peasants after liberation, they actively competed to contribute grain for the counter-offensive. In Duanjiazhuang, Yuanzhuang, Nancun, and Zhaojiashan villages in Licheng County, 142 liberated peasants, including Song Shun and Yu Wensen, voluntarily contributed an additional 2,888 jin of grain for the counter-offensive. Many liberated peasants in Changzhi and Huguan had not paid public grain last year. This year, after harvesting the grain, they prepared it early to be delivered. Yang Renshan, a military dependent in Xincun, donated five dou of rice. She said, "The landlord oppressed me all my life, and the enemy (referring to the Japanese invaders) killed my husband. In order to defeat Chiang Kai-shek, I am happy even if I eat chaff and wild herbs." Wang Xinke from Wangzhuang, Pingshun County, said, "Last winter, I was allocated three mu of riverside land. The other day, I used two large oxen to plow it. The more I plowed, the happier I became. This year, in addition to the amount of public grain I should pay, I will contribute an extra fifty jin of rice so that our troops can eat well and fight Chiang Kai-shek."

　　Milling Well and Milling Fast

　　"Milling well and milling fast" is the consistent goal of the masses in various regions this year. For example, Wu Songqi's 51-year-old mother in Caozhuang, Licheng County, while pushing the millstone, directed her daughter-in-law, saying, "Pick out the stones and sorghum in the grain completely. We must let our troops eat some good rice." Zhang Heigou from Zhangzhang Village in Changzhi County, after fanning the milled rice once, saw that there was still chaff and fanned it a second time. He said, "In the past, we paid burdens to the enemy and mixed chaff. Now that we have been liberated, the public grain is for our own troops to eat, so we must mill it well." Under his influence, the public grain of the whole village ranked first in the whole district. When delivering corn, because the corn was not dry, he mobilized people to borrow old corn to deliver first, and then return it when it was dry. Because livestock and people are very busy with autumn plowing, in order to ensure that the two are not delayed, various places have generally organized semi-able-bodied laborers, especially women, to mill public grain. Generally, groups are divided according to the millstone, with several people per millstone. In villages with fewer millstones and more people, shifts are divided to rotate the millstones, so that the millstones are not idle. For example, in Nantianhe, Changzhi County, four women used one millstone, and all seventeen millstones in the village were running, milling a total of 281 dan of rice. Various places also created methods for recording points for milling public grain. In Nantianhe, milling five dou of grain was the standard, worth five points, and milling one more dou was worth an extra 1.5 points. Men who came back from the fields to help with milling grain at night earned 1.5 points per dou. In Changzhi, Huguan, Pingshun, Licheng, and Lu’an counties, many villages milled day and night. Because they were afraid of not seeing clearly at night, most of them milled coarse rice (first milling) at night and fine rice during the day.

　　Women Delivering Public Grain

　　Speaking of our district, this is the first time this year that women have carried and delivered public grain. Qin Xuezhe, the chairman of the women's association in Ziliang Village, Huguan County, and Dong Qiaozhe, the leader of the women's militia, were very excited when they heard the masses discussing the delivery of public grain, and they volunteered to sign up to deliver it. Then, twenty young women also competed to go, each carrying at least 45 jin of rice. Yang Jinze, the textile heroine from Xibaipo, also led eight women to deliver public grain to Shuzhang Village. She carried 78 jin alone, which was enough to match a man.

　　Mutual Assistance and Lending to Pay Public Grain

　　In Xibayu Village, Licheng County, some newly-liberated poor and hired peasants planted more cotton this year and less grain. They immediately sold cotton to buy grain, feeling that they were losing out. However, under the class love that all peasants in the world are one family, eight middle-peasant households, including Li Zhentong, lent out twelve shi of millet, solving the difficulty for twelve poor and hired households who did not have rice to pay public grain at the moment, waiting for the price of cotton to rise before returning the millet. In Qiucun, Changzhi First District, under the leadership of Zhao Lianzhi, they called on people to use sideline production to pay public grain, and newly-liberated peasants stored grain for famine preparedness. For the past year, the mutual aid group in the village has combined agriculture and sideline production. Lianzhi's group first used the profits from sideline production to buy 15 shi of rice to pay public grain, and then each household returned it through sideline production. Three of the seven groups in the village have done this. (Taihang Third Special District Office)

### 太行三专区秋屯中的翻身农民

　　太行三专区秋屯中的翻身农民
    本区今年的秋屯，是结合秋耕进行的，但从评分、碾米到送粮，一般只用五天到十天的时间，便全部完成（有的只用三天），而且做到耕、屯两不误，交的快又交的好，充分表现了土改后翻身农民的觉悟与支援前线的高度热情。
    “多缴粮，捉老蒋”
    这是平顺虹梯关翻身农民自己提出的口号，各地在农民翻身自觉下，纷纷争献反攻粮。黎城段家庄、元庄、南村、赵家山等四个村，宋顺、宇文森等百四十二个翻身农民，自动多缴反攻粮二千八百八十八斤。长治、壶关好些翻身农民，去年没出公粮，今年收了谷，就早早准备下等着出。辛村军属杨仁山献米五斗，他说：“地主压迫了我一辈子，敌人（指日寇）又把我男人杀死，为了打倒蒋介石，我吃糠咽菜也高兴。”平顺王庄王新科说：“去冬分到三亩河湾地，前天用两个大牛去犁，越犁越高兴，今年除我应出的公粮数目外，再多出五十斤米，叫咱军队吃饱好打蒋介石。”
    碾的好碾的快
    “碾的好碾的快”，是今年各地群众一致的奋斗目标。如黎城曹庄吴松奇的五十一岁的老母，一边推碾，一边指挥着媳妇说：“把谷里的石头、高粱拣的一干二净，总要叫咱们军队吃些好米哩。”长治针掌村张黑狗，碾的米扇了一遍，看见还有糠，又扇了个第二遍。他说：“过去给敌人出负担掺糠搅秕；现在翻了身，公粮是叫自己的部队吃哩，可得碾好些。”在他的影响下，全村公粮占了全区第一份。交花料，因为玉茭不干，他又动员先借旧玉茭交了，等干了再归还。因为秋耕牲口、人都很忙，为了做到两不误，各地普遍组织半辅劳力，特别是妇女碾公粮，一般是按碾划分小组，几个人一盘碾。碾少人多的村，划分班轮碾，不让闲起碾来。如长治南天河，是四个妇女一盘碾，全村十七个碾子，全部转动，共碾米二百八十一石。各地并创造出碾公粮记分办法，南天河是以碾五斗谷为标准，顶五分，多碾一斗，多顶一分五。男人从地回来搭黑碾米，一斗顶一分五。长、壶、平、黎、潞，不少村庄是连明彻夜的碾，恐怕黑夜看不清，大部是黑夜碾糙米（头遍）白天碾细米。
    妇女送公粮
    在本区说来，妇女担送公粮，今年还是第一次。壶关子良村妇救主席秦雪则，妇女民兵队长董巧则，听到群众讨论送公粮，她俩很兴奋的自动报名去送，接着有二十个青年妇女，也争着要去，每人至少背米四十五斤。西柏坡纺织英雄杨金则，也带领八个妇女往树掌村送公粮，她一个人担了七十八斤，足足也顶住一个男人。
    互助互借缴公粮
    黎城西柏峪村，有些贫雇新翻身农民，今年种的棉花多，谷少，马上卖棉花买谷，感到吃亏，但在天下农民是一家的阶级的友爱下，李贞同等八户中农，借出小米十二石，解决了十二户贫雇当下没米缴公粮的困难，等待花价上涨，再归还小米。长治一区邱村，在赵连枝领导下，号召副业生产交公粮，新翻身农民存粮备荒。该村互助组，一年来就是农、副结合，连枝组首先以本组副业生产红利统一买米十五石缴了公粮，以后各户副业生产归还。全村七个组，这样做的已有三个组。（太行三专办公室）
