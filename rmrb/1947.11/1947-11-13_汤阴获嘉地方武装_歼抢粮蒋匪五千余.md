　　[Tangyin News from this newspaper] On the 22nd of last month, the enemy concentrated about 500 team members from Guxian, Xilonghua, and Taihuangcun areas to launch a full-scale attack on villages in our Sixth District Yaoshide, Baijiaying, and Chengguan District, attempting to seize grain, conscript soldiers, and nibble away at Baijiaying, a village on our front and rear routes. Our main militia force immediately engaged in combat. Our Independent Detachment ambushed the enemy at the edge of Dongwan Zhang Village, defeating the enemy's attack from Beidian, wounding three enemies. After the enemy attacking Chengguan entered the city, our Chengguan Working Team and Public Security Police Station immediately entered the city from the southwest gate within about an hour, capturing two enemy team members; they drove the enemy back to Dahuang Village when it got dark, wounding two enemies. Our Armed Branch Second Detachment, Lin Branch First Detachment, She County Detachment, and others tenaciously resisted the enemy occupying the front and rear route villages and Baijiaying, preventing the enemy from advancing any further. The enemy shrunk into the villages of Qianhoulu Village, Hanzhuang, and Lijiaying at night. At 4:00 p.m. on the 23rd, we launched a fierce attack on the enemy in Qianhoulu Village and Lijiaying. Our Independent Detachment Sixth District Militia and Second District Militia platoon detoured from the rear of the enemy in Lijiaying, completely defeating the enemy, killing and wounding eight enemies, injuring four enemies, and capturing three. Qianhoulu Village was recaptured by us. After two days of battle, the enemy's plan to nibble and seize grain was completely smashed.

　　[Huojia News from this newspaper] "Arm the masses to protect the autumn harvest and grain, and trap the enemy to death in their strongholds!" Our Huojia and Wuzhi Independent Battalions dealt a fatal blow to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits looting grain, annihilating more than 30 enemies.

　　One battalion of the Chiang Kai-shek 41st Division, about 500 people, combined with the "Security Regiments" of Wuzhi and Wenxian counties and local township bandits and fleeing landlords, formed a grain-looting team of about 2,000 people, which disturbed the Dahongqiao and Yuezhuang areas of our Wuzhi Second District at dawn on October 22nd. Its southern route went west along the Yellow River embankment, and one route advanced along the Qin River embankment. That night, our battalion learned of the information and immediately detoured behind the enemy in a planned manner. Taking them by surprise, we launched a fierce battle against the enemy's regular army at Nanhongqiao at 6:20 a.m. All our brave soldiers rushed into the village and launched street fighting. The model company, the Huojia First Detachment, upon hearing the gunfire, rushed down the mountain like fierce tigers, bravely charging and killing. The enemy, inexplicably confused, was thrown into chaos. Comrade Wang Anqing, the second platoon leader of the Huojia First Detachment, vigilantly jumped onto a house, threw a grenade, and then jumped into the courtyard, seized a machine gun, and killed two enemies including Liang Hongpu, the pseudo-township captain. The enemy's formation was in great disarray, and they used all their strength to turn around and run, abandoning their armor and helmets in a disheveled manner. We immediately pursued them in separate routes and returned only after reaching Wuchekou, more than ten miles away.

　　In this battle, we killed the stubborn enemy township captain Liang Hongpu, search platoon leader Liu Zhiping, and ten others below, wounded more than twenty, captured one, seized one machine gun, ten rifles, one pistol, and a part of the spoils of war, and intercepted all the property looted from the masses and immediately returned it to the masses.
