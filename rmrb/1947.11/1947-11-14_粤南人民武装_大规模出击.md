　　Guangdong Southern People's Armed Forces
    Large-Scale Attacks
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 11th] According to an Associated Press dispatch from Guangzhou on the 9th, citing Chiang Kai-shek's official Guangdong News Agency, the Guangdong Southern People's Armed Forces Corps continues to launch large-scale attacks. On October 31st, a "large force" of People's Armed Forces engaged in a fierce battle with Chiang Kai-shek's troops in Suixi County overnight. On November 3rd, over 800 People's Armed Forces in the county encountered Chiang Kai-shek's troops. On the 4th, over 1,000 People's Armed Forces launched a fierce attack on Chiang Kai-shek's positions. The continuous attacks by the powerful People's Armed Forces in Guangdong have made Chiang Kai-shek's authorities uneasy. The Chairman of Chiang Kai-shek's Guangdong province, Song Ziwen, recently flew to Nanjing to seek instructions from the Chiang Kai-shek bandit. According to the Central News Agency, Song Ziwen returned to Guangdong on the 7th and, when meeting with journalists on the 8th, lamented: "The most important issue in Guangdong province at present is the issue of public security." It is reported that Chiang Kai-shek is also very fearful of the activities of the People's Armed Forces in Guangdong, but has no regular troops to reinforce them, and only told Song Ziwen to "strengthen the police force" as a "solution."

　　粤南人民武装
    大规模出击
    【新华社陕北十一日电】据美联社广州九日电引蒋匪官方广东新闻社消息透露，粤南人民武装兵团继续大规模出击。十月卅一日“大股”人民武装在遂溪与蒋匪激战竟夜，十一月三日该县人民武装八百余人与蒋匪发生遭遇战，四日人民武装千余人又向蒋匪阵地猛烈攻击。广东强大人民武装的不断出击，使蒋匪当局岌岌不安，该省蒋匪主席宋子文最近特为此飞往南京向蒋贼请示。据中央社息，宋子文于七日返粤，八日招待新闻记者时哀鸣：“粤省当前最重要者为治安问题。”据悉：蒋介石对广东人民武装的活动亦十分恐惧，但又没有任何正规军可资增援，只叫宋子文“增强保警力量”作为“解决办法”。
