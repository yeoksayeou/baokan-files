Xinhua News Agency, East China, 7th: Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops, consisting of the 8th and 36th Brigades of the 54th Division, and two regiments of the 25th Division, occupying Laiyang, launched a northern attack on October 25th. On the 27th, the People's Liberation Army seized the opportunity to attack the west and south gates of Laiyang, firing over 30 shells into the city, and completely eliminated the "Home Return Corps" at Dongxing and Gupei, eight miles south of the city, capturing 104 of them alive. The two brigades of the 54th Division that had scurried to Xujia Dian, seventy miles southeast of Louling, were also blocked by us on the 30th. After inflicting over a hundred casualties on the enemy, the unit scurried back to Laiyang in panic on the 1st of this month.

Furthermore, a certain unit of the Jiaodong People's Liberation Army ambushed a certain unit of the 8th Brigade of the 54th Division and another company transporting military supplies for Chiang Kai-shek's bandits at Yukeding (fifty miles south of Louxia) on the 28th of last month, killing and wounding over thirty enemy soldiers, capturing over fifty alive, and burning four trucks loaded with clothing on the spot.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 6th: The People's Liberation Army in Weihaiwei City has been blocking the invading Chiang Kai-shek bandits for over twenty days. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits, in coordination with naval and air forces, have launched fierce attacks but have failed to succeed. The enemy, blocked in the Cotton Mountain area, are with their backs to the mountain and facing the water, and can only sigh at the city from afar. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits' invasion has been frustrated, and the morale of the soldiers is wavering. In recent days, nine people, including Ma Zhenbang, a second lieutenant platoon leader of the 25th Division, and Lai Huating, a squad leader, have successively defected with their weapons. The order in Weihaiwei City is normal, and prices are stable. The liberated masses outside the north gate of the city are still busy distributing the fruits of the struggle, and the democratic government in the urban area is stepping up its efforts to provide relief and compensation to the citizens injured by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' artillery fire. The liberated women of Laijiashan in Yangting District milled 4,000 catties of military grain in three days and nights, and carried stretchers more than 30 times.

    莱阳匪北犯受挫
    犯威市敌被阻棉花山
    【新华社华东七日电】侵据莱阳之蒋匪五十四师第八、三十六两个旅及二十五师两个团，于十月二十五日分途北犯，二十七日，解放军乘虚袭入莱阳西关、南关，向城内发炮三十余发，并将城南八里之东兴、古培的“还乡团”全部解决，活捉其一百零四名。窜到楼灵东南七十余里之徐家店的五十四师两个旅，于三十日亦被我阻击，毙伤其百余名后，该部当仓惶于本月一日全部窜回莱阳。
    又讯：胶东解放军某部于上月二十八日在榆科顶（楼霞南五十里）伏击蒋匪押运军用品的五十四师八旅某部及另部一个连，毙伤敌三十余名，生俘五十余名，并将满载被服之汽车四辆当场焚毁。
    【新华社华东六日电】威海卫市解放军阻击进犯蒋匪，至今已达二十余天，蒋匪海空配合猛犯迄未得逞，被阻于棉花山一带之敌临山背水，始终只能望城兴叹。蒋匪进犯受挫，兵心动摇，连日已有二十五师少尉排长马振邦，班长赖华亭等九人先后携枪投诚。威市市内现秩序如常，物价稳定，市郊北门外翻身群众仍忙着分配斗争果实，市区民主政府加紧进行救济抚恤被蒋匪炮火击伤的市民，广大市民亦废寝忘食的支援我军作战。羊亭区赖家山翻身妇女曾三昼夜间赶磨军粮四千斤，并抬运担架三十余次。
