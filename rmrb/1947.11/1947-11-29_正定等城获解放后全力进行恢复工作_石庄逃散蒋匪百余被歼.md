　　[Xinhua News Agency Jin察冀 (Jinchaji) 27th Dispatch] After Zhengding, Huolu, Qingxian and other cities were liberated again, the local democratic governments are cooperating with the people to fully carry out various restoration works. The Zhengding Municipal Government transported a large number of various grains and began to sell them to citizens at low prices, so prices have stabilized rapidly. Thousands of farmers in Huolu city have organized to launch liquidation struggles against local tyrants and landlords such as Cao Zhitang, and have divided dozens of dan of mixed grains and a large amount of windfall wealth. In Qingxian city, in the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, 264 large and small businesses closed down during the enemy occupation. Since our liberation in September, the number has increased from only 48 to 222. The publicly operated credit cooperatives also sold a large amount of homespun cloth and cotton to regulate the market. Chiang Kai-shek's currency has been completely eliminated, and three primary schools have officially opened.

　　[Xinhua News Agency Jin察冀 (Jinchaji) 27th Dispatch] Xinle militia, in coordination with the main force, completely annihilated more than one hundred Chiang Kai-shek bandits who had fled from Shijiazhuang. On the morning of the 12th, more than 150 officers and soldiers of the 96th Regiment of the 32nd Division of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits fled from Shijiazhuang, attempting to flee north to Baoding. When they fled to the Dangjia Village area of the Third District of Xinle, they were surrounded by the local militia. Immediately, they cooperated with the People's Liberation Army to completely annihilate the enemy, capturing more than 120 bandits below the rank of deputy battalion commander alive, killing and wounding more than 30 enemies, and seizing one small cannon, three machine guns, and more than 30 long and short guns.
