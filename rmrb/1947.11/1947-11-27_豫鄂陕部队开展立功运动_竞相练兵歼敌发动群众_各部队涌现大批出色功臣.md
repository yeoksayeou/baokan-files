Xinhua News Agency, Yu-E-Shaan Front, 25th: Amidst studying the General Headquarters' Double Tenth Declaration and slogans, the front-line troops have launched a zealous merit campaign to annihilate the enemy, mobilize the masses, actively train troops in combat intervals, mobilize the masses, and strive for merits in battle. A certain unit decided to carry out the "Four Goods" movement, namely: good at fighting, good at discipline, good at mobilizing the masses, and good at consolidating the troops.

　　In seven days, the unit ignited the flames of liberation in over sixty villages, distributing more than 8,000 *shi* of grain, 26,000 *jin* of cotton, and a large amount of clothing, tobacco, salt, gold, silver, livestock, etc., to 30,000 peasants, and further helped the masses organize their own forces to thoroughly carry out the equal distribution of land. The unit initially lacked confidence in mobilizing the masses, but after experimenting in one village and one area, their confidence immediately increased, and they took action wherever they went. Their main experience was to resolutely grasp the line of the poor and hired peasants, and not be bound by the experience of mobilizing the masses in the old liberated areas. They acted while educating, struggled while organizing, and raised the masses and transformed the regime through struggle. In terms of troop training, the 5th Company of the 1st Battalion often trained troops the morning after a night march. During the march, they also often assumed enemy situations and had everyone practice. Once, when they arrived at a village, they immediately assumed that there were local reactionaries in the village to be captured alive. The soldiers seriously implemented the breakthrough of the front line, in-depth development, and village search. Once, when they were about to attack a certain city, they marched on the first day and practiced siege warfare on the second day. As soon as the cadres arrived at the驻地, they studied the terrain and tactics. The extremely low casualties in the battle of the eastern foothills of Mount Funiu this time demonstrated the rapid improvement of combat skills. Others, such as the direct unit of the Headquarters, mobilized the masses in sixty-eight villages in six days, distributing 1,195 *shi* of grain, 1,180 packages of clothing, and countless other furniture. They are currently helping the masses to carry out the equal distribution of land. Many outstanding meritorious people and heroes have emerged in various units. Such as Shi Lailiang, Li Buzhou, Bao Guoshi, Yue Shuangwang, Wang Anguo, etc. Wang Anguo was promoted to deputy platoon leader due to his military merits. Chai Yongcheng and Li Ru, newly liberated soldiers in western Henan, were awarded merits for their bravery. In the Shishantou battle, Wang Yulin, a newly liberated soldier, captured fifteen enemies in the Hancheng battle. He was injured but did not retreat and was awarded great merit.

Xinhua News Agency, Yu-E-Shaan Front, 25th:随军 reporter Lu Chao reports: The Party Committee of a certain unit has recently issued an order to reward the meritorious troops of the infantry, artillery, and engineering units who resolutely completed their tasks. The 5th and 6th companies of a certain battalion valiantly repelled several fierce attacks by an entire brigade of Chiang bandits at Caozhuang between Baofeng and Lushan on the 6th of this month, killing and wounding more than 300 of them, and resolutely completed the tasks assigned by their superiors. The engineering unit of the unit erected three bridges over the Yi River, Ru River, and Sha River extremely quickly under extremely tiring conditions, enabling vehicles and horses to pass safely. Wang Sanji, the deputy company commander of a certain company, personally went into the water to take the lead in erecting the bridges. Due to the cold weather, eight comrades fell ill as a result, but none of them complained. In addition, the artillery unit of the unit has repeatedly established remarkable achievements. In the Longhai battle, a certain team fired seventy-three shells and hit seventy-one of them. They can complete their tasks 100% under any difficulties and are now recognized as the model company of the artillery unit of the unit. In addition to awarding material rewards to the meritorious troops, the Party Committee of the unit called on the entire army to learn from the model companies of various units.

Xinhua News Agency, Yu-E-Shaan Front, 23rd: The platoon where the famous combat hero Shi Lailiang is located was collectively awarded great merit in the Jiaxian siege and annihilation battle. When launching the general attack on the enemy's last stronghold in Jiaxian, the platoon served as the assault team. Those who were lightly wounded in the entire team insisted on not leaving the front line until the enemy was completely wiped out. The five members of Shi Lailiang's squad who participated in the assault, led by Shi Lailiang, rushed to the enemy's front line and were all wounded by machine-gun fire one after another, but none of them made a sound. After the defending enemies on the front line were suppressed by our artillery fire, they were the first to jump up and fiercely pursue the enemy, capturing all the enemies on the front line. In this battle, these five blood-stained warriors captured a total of forty-three enemies. Shi Lailiang himself captured fourteen enemies and seized one light machine gun and seven rifles. The entire platoon captured more than ninety enemies.

　　豫鄂陕部队开展立功运动

    各部队涌现大批出色功臣
    【新华社豫鄂陕前线二十五日电】前线各部队在学习总部双十宣言及口号中，掀起了歼敌、发动群众立功运动的热潮，积极在战斗空隙中练兵、发动群众及在战斗中争相立功。某部队决定开展“四好”运动，即打仗好，纪律好，发动群众好，巩固部队好。
    该部七天中，在六十余村点起群众翻身的烈火，三万农民分得粮食八千余石，棉花二万六千斤，及大量衣物、烟草、食盐、金银、牲畜等，并进一步帮助群众组织自己的力量，彻底进行平分土地。部队在发动群众之初，尚无太大信心，但经一村一地的实验后，立时信心大增，走到那里就在那里动手。他们主要的经验就是坚决掌握贫雇路线，不为老解放区发动群众的经验所束缚。一面行动，一面教育，一面斗争，一面组织，从斗争中提高群众，改造政权。在练兵方面，一营五连，常是经过一夜行军后，第二天早晨还要练兵。在行军中亦常假设敌情，让大家演习，有次他们到达某村时马上假设村内有土顽，要活捉。战士们认真的实行了突破前沿，纵深发展，村落搜索。有次要进攻某城，第一天行军，第二天即演习攻坚，干部一到驻地就研究地形和战术。这次伏牛东麓战役我之伤亡极少，就说明了战斗技术的迅速提高。其他如司令部直属队在六天内发动六十八个村庄群众，分粮一千一百九十五石，衣物一千一百八十包，及其他家具无数，目前正帮助群众进行平分土地。各部队中现已出现了很多出色的功臣、英雄。如时来亮、李步周、包国士、岳双旺、王安国等，王安国并因战功而升任副排长。豫西新解放的战士柴永成、李儒等都因奋勇而记了功。在石山头战斗中，新解放的战士王玉林在韩城战斗中俘敌十五人，自身受伤不退，而被记了大功。
    【新华社豫鄂陕前线二十五日电】随军记者鲁潮报导：某部队党委会顷发布命令，奖励坚决完成任务的步、炮、工各有功部队。某营五、六两连，本月六日在宝丰、鲁山间之曹庄顽强击退蒋匪一个整旅的几次猛烈进攻，毙伤其三百余人，坚决完成上级任务。该部工兵在极度疲劳的情况下，极迅速的架起了伊河、汝河、沙河的三座桥梁。使车马安然通过。某连副连长王三祭亲自下水带头架设，因天气寒冷，有八个同志因此冻病，亦均毫无怨言。又该部炮兵历建奇功，此次陇海战役中某队发炮七十三发，命中七十一发，他们在任何困难下，均能百分之百的完成任务，现已公认为该部炮兵队的模范连。部队党委会除以实物奖励给各有功部队外，并号召全军向各部模范连队学习。
    【新华社豫鄂陕前线二十三日电】著名战斗英雄时来亮所在排，在郏县攻坚歼灭战中，集体被记大功。在郏县总攻敌人最后据点时，该排担任突击队，全队轻伤者坚持不下前线，直到把敌人完全消灭。时来亮班参加突击的五个人，在时来亮率领下冲到敌人前沿，都先后被机枪打伤，但他们谁也没作声，到前沿守敌被我炮火压倒后，又首先跃起猛追敌人，把前沿敌人全部俘获，在这次战斗中，这五个鲜血沾衣的勇士共俘敌四十三名，时来亮本人俘敌十四名，缴轻机枪一挺，步枪七支。全排则俘敌九十余名。
