Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: Paris dispatch: The National Committee of the French General Confederation of Labor (CGT) began its meeting on the 12th to discuss issues related to the labor movement and the French economy. The meeting showed that the conspiracy of the right-wing socialists to split the labor movement has been severely hit. In the discussion about deciding on steps to guarantee workers' minimum living standards, and whether union members should consult non-union members and act in unison with them, the Socialist Party committee, led by Stone House, opposed union members consulting and acting in unison with non-union members, arguing that this would "lead to recklessness." However, the vast majority of committee members supported the Communist Party's proposal for united action by all workers. Most committee members believed that unity was "a matter of course because the dissatisfaction of the working class is unanimous." They emphasized the need to unite all republican citizens to face the "de Gaulle activities." On the night of the 12th, the vote on this emergency motion resulted in the Communist Party proposal receiving 832 votes, or slightly less than 89.2 percent of the total votes cast, while the Socialist Party's opposition motion received only 101 votes, or slightly more than 10.8 percent. The French Communist Party achieved an overwhelming victory.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: TASS reports: The meeting of the National Committee of the French General Confederation of Labor in Paris concluded on the 14th. The meeting heard a report by the General Secretary of the General Confederation of Labor, Stone House, on the international situation. Stone House's report suggested that the General Confederation of Labor should accept the Marshall Plan, but this suggestion was immediately countered by other speakers. The Secretary of the General Confederation of Labor and General Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, Saillant, declared that he opposed the Marshall Plan and called on the General Confederation of Labor to raise the banner against US imperialism. Saillant said that the policy of supporting the US plan was reminiscent of the Munich appeasement policy. The other General Secretary of the General Confederation of Labor, the Communist Party member Frachon, countered Stone House, saying that the purpose of the so-called US "aid to Europe" plan was to subordinate the European economy to the US expansion plan. As a result of the vote taken at the meeting, Frachon's proposal received the support of the majority. The meeting passed a resolution unconditionally endorsing the resolution signed by the representatives of the General Confederation of Labor and the Soviet Trade Union Committee in Moscow on September 13, pledging loyalty to the World Federation of Trade Unions, resolutely implementing the resolutions of the World Federation of Trade Unions, and opposing all attempts to reduce the role of the World Federation of Trade Unions in the United Nations to benefit other organizations. The resolution condemned the Marshall Plan as part of the US trusts' plan to enslave the world and prepare for a new war. The resolution opposed attempts to justify the Marshall Plan with France's urgent need for raw materials and equipment. The resolution declared that accepting this plan was tantamount to depriving the country of its sovereignty and allowing the United States to interfere in France's internal affairs. The National Committee of the General Confederation of Labor called on French workers to join with the working people of the world to oppose the instigators of a new war, and expressed confidence that this struggle would bring the criminal schemes of these war instigators to failure. The resolution on domestic workers' lives exposed the conspiracy of the US and French reactionaries to split the General Confederation of Labor, and especially exposed the sabotage activities of Brown, a representative of the American Federation of Labor, who funded those workers who had been expelled from the union for colluding with the enemy. The resolution also condemned those who took reactionary measures against labor, and the use of military police to disrupt strikes and whip workers.

　　社会党右派分裂阴谋遭打击
  　法共在总工会内获胜
    通过联合全体工人一致行动　决议反对美帝“马歇尔计划”
    【新华社陕北十六日电】巴黎讯：法国总工会全国委员会十二日起举行会议，讨论有关工人运动及法国经济等类问题。会议显示社会党右派分裂工人运动的阴谋活动，已遭到严重的打击。在讨论关于决定保障工人最低生活之步骤，工会会员是否应征询非工会会员意见，并与他们一致行动之问题时，社会党委员以石屋为首，反对工会会员与非工会会员商议和一致行动，认为这样会“引起冒险”。但是会议绝大多数委员赞成共产党所提联合全体工人一致行动的意见。大多数委员认为联合是“理所当然的，因为工人阶级的不满是一致的”。他们强调有团结一切共和国公民正视“戴高乐活动”的必要。十二日夜，会议表决此项急诊的结果是：共产党提案获八三二票，或投票总数百分之八十九点二弱，社会党反对案仅获一○一票，或百分之十点八强，法共获得了压倒的胜利。
    【新华社陕北十八日电】塔斯社报导：法总工会全国委员会在巴黎举行的会议，已于十四日结束。会议曾听取总工会总书记石屋关于国际形势的报告，石屋报告建议，总工会应接受马歇尔计划，惟此项建议立即遭到其他发言人的反击。总工会书记兼世界职工联盟总书记赛南宣称：他反对马歇尔计划，并号召总工会举起反对美帝国主义的旗帜。赛南称：拥护美国这一计划的政策，使人忆起慕尼黑的投降政策。总工会另一总书记法共党员佛拉商反击石屋称：所谓美国“援欧”计划，其目的乃在将欧洲经济附属于美国的扩张计划。会议举行表决的结果佛拉商的提议获得了大多数的赞助。会议通过决议，无条件地赞成九月十三日总工会代表在莫斯科法苏职工委员会签订的决议，誓忠实于世界职工联盟，坚决执行世职的决议，并反对一切意图缩小世职在联合国中的作用以利其他组织的企图。决议谴责马歇尔计划为美国托拉斯奴役世界并准备新战争的计划之组成部分。决议反对那种意欲以法国急须原料和装备来为马歇尔计划找口实的企图。决议宣称：接受这一计划，即等于剥夺国家的主权，及美国干涉法国内政。总工会全国委员会号召法国劳动者与全世界劳动人民共同反对新战争挑拨者，并表示相信这种斗争将使这些战争挑拨者的犯罪诡谋归于失败。关于国内职工生活的决议，则揭露美法反动派分裂总工会的阴谋，特别揭露美国劳联代表布朗的破坏活动，此人资助那些因与敌人勾结而被工会开除的工人叛徒。该决议并谴责那些采取反对劳工的反动措施的人们，及利用军警来破坏罢工与鞭打工人的行为。
