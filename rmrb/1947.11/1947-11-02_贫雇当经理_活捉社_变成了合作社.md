    Poor and Hired Peasants as Managers
    "Seizing-Alive Cooperative" Transformed into Cooperative
    Qiao Lin Peng Xin
    The cooperative in Li Village was established by farmers pooling shares. It has an oil mill and a cotton gin, solving the oil consumption and women's weaving problems for the whole village. Everything is cheaper than in the market. Buying oil outside costs 500 yuan per catty, while the cooperative sells it for only 450 yuan per catty. Outside, oil cakes cost 50,000 yuan per 1,000 catties, while the cooperative sells them for only 45,000 yuan per 1,000 catties. In one month, 723 catties of oil were sold (only to villagers), saving 3,615 yuan. 12,000 catties of oil cakes were sold, saving 60,000 yuan. This not only solved the difficulty of villagers going to other villages to buy oil, but also saved 40 workdays.
    In terms of the cotton gin, the main functions are ginning and milling. Ginning cotton supplies the women in the village for weaving, and the price is cheaper than in the market. Some women also exchange raw cotton for ginned cotton. By this calculation, a total of 1,500 catties of cotton were ginned (raw cotton turned into ginned cotton). Compared with the market, there was a difference of 33 catties of cotton waste, saving 33,000 yuan and 30 workdays. The main function of the mill is to purchase raw cotton from the village. The purchase price is higher than in the market (195 yuan per catty in the market, 200 yuan per catty in the cooperative). In total, the cooperative earned a profit of 557,305 yuan in one month, saving 70 workdays and 130,150 yuan. This laid the foundation for surviving the famine and increased the people's confidence in the cooperative.
    The successful experience of the Li Village cooperative is to have poor and hired peasants as managers. In the past, the people called the cooperative the "Seizing-Alive Cooperative" because it did not benefit the people at all, and the profits were wasted by the managers. Later, after discussion, the people realized that only poor peasants and tenants could truly work for the benefit of the people. They also established fifteen rules for the cooperative, including: (1) The cooperative should serve the people to the end, develop cooperative undertakings, support agriculture, and launch the winter weaving movement; (2) Practice thrift and economy, and overcome waste; (3) Everyone should discuss matters together, oppose arrogance, and the decisions of meetings must be implemented; (4) The cooperative's manager and deputy manager should listen to the opinions of the people and promote a democratic style of work (these are the main ones, a total of fifteen in detail). Under everyone's management, the people of the village have all benefited. The share capital has increased from 600,000 yuan to 1,500,000 yuan. Out of a total of 186 households in the village, 150 households have become shareholders.
    In the Houjia Village cooperative, the former president, a well-to-do middle peasant named Jin Laoxin, did not care about anything in the cooperative, wasted resources everywhere, and also embezzled 1,500 catties of cotton seeds. Each share also lost one yuan and five jiao. Thus, the people rose up and dismissed him, and elected a liberated peasant, Li Zhenshan, as manager. In seventeen days, he earned 384,300 yuan. The people reflected that the "Living Peel Cooperative" had become a "Cooperative". Therefore, another 290 shares (1,000 yuan per share) were developed.

    贫雇当经理
    “活捉社”变成了合作社
    乔林  蓬新
    里村的合作社是农民集股搞起来的，有一个油坊和花坊，解决了全村吃油和妇女纺织问题。一切东西都比市场上便宜，外边买油五百元一斤，社里只四百五十元一斤，外边油饼一千斤五万元，社里一千斤只四万五千元，一月统计卖出油七百二十三斤（只本村）节省洋三千六百一十五元，卖出油饼一万二千斤，节省六万元，这样因为解决群众去外村打油的困难，又节省了工四十个。
    在花坊方面主要是弹和轧，弹花是供给本村妇女纺织，价钱比市上便宜，也有的妇女拿籽花换走熟花，这样计算共弹花一千五百斤（籽花变成熟花），和集上比较共差三十三斤花穰，省洋三万三千元，省工三十个。轧花主要是收买本村的籽花，买时价钱比集市上高（集上是一百九十五元一斤，社里是二百元一斤），总计一个月共赚了红利五十五万七千三百零五元，省工七十个，节省洋十三万零一百五十元，这样打下了渡荒基碍，又提高了群众对合作社的信心。
    里村合作社办的好的经验就是要贫雇佃当经理，在以前群众把合作社叫成“活捉社”，一点也没给群众谋了利益，赚的都教经手人浪费了，后来群众讨论才知道只有贫佃当经理，才能真正为群众谋利益，并订了合作社的十五条规则：其中有（一）合作社为群众服务到底，发展合作事业扶植农业开展今冬纺织运动；（二）俭省节约克服浪费现象；（三）有事大家商量，反对自高自大，会议决定必须执行；（四）合作社正副经理听从群众意见，发扬民主作风（主要的有这几条，零碎的共十五条）。该村合作社在大家的管理下，群众都得到了利益，股金由六十万元增到（一百五十万元）全村共一百八十六户，入股者占一百五十户。
    侯家庄的合作社以前由老中农靳老信当社长，对社内一切事情都不关心，处处浪费，还贪污了花籽一千五百斤，每股还赔了一元五角，这样群众起来把他罢免了，另选翻身农民李振山当经理，在十七天内即赚洋三十八万四千三百元，群众反映说：“活剥社”变成了“合作社”了，因次又发展了二百九十股（每股一千元）。
