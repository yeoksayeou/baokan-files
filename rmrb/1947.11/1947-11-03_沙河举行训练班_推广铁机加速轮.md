    Shahe Holds Training Class
    Promoting the Iron Machine Speed-Up Wheel
    [This newspaper, Shahe News] This year, about 75,000 people in Shahe suffered from the disaster. According to surveys in Lower Cao and Yaopo villages, the autumn harvest averaged only nine Xiaodou of grain per person. Even with bran and vegetables, it will only last until the first month of the lunar calendar next year, leaving a four-month food shortage until the wheat harvest. The fifth, sixth, and seventh districts, and the latter half of the first and second districts, which had better harvests, averaged about 70% of a normal year. In order to carry out weaving and textile production this winter and next spring to overcome the famine, the county cooperative held a joint meeting of district cooperative directors on September 28th to rectify cooperative affairs and clarify the direction. On October 6th, a large training class was held for 374 women, 75 village cooperative directors, and 69 iron and wood workers in the county, to study and research the promotion of accelerated wheel carts and iron machines (an iron machine can weave more than six Zhang per day), improve technology, improve the quality of cloth, and expand sales channels. For example, if women learn to use the accelerated wheel and iron machine, they can weave twice as much. In the past, each woman averaged six Jin of cloth per month, but after learning, they can produce twelve Jin. Furthermore, because the quality of Jinan cloth is higher than that of Shahe, the sales of Shahe cloth have gradually disappeared. If the technology or quality is not improved, the sales will be low, and the profits will not be high, which will hinder the development of this year's textile movement. Furthermore, the study focused on how to purchase and store textile raw materials. This year, only 40,000 Mu of cotton were planted in the county, which can yield 500,000 Jin. The county has 50,000 weaving women, who can produce 3,000,000 Jin of cloth annually, resulting in a shortage of 2,500,000 Jin of cotton. With the promotion of the accelerated wheel, 4,500,000 Jin of cloth can be produced annually, resulting in a shortage of 4,000,000 Jin of cotton. The consensus was to mainly mobilize the masses to save their own raw materials. Currently, women have stored no less than 70,000 to 80,000 Jin of woven cloth. This year, there is still enough food to eat until the end of the year. The woven cloth is exchanged for cotton but not for grain. The district cooperative will open cotton cloth shops, and the county cooperative will set up cotton shops in Dalian Town to help the masses purchase raw materials and promote finished products.

    沙河举行训练班
    推广铁机加速轮
    【本报沙河讯】沙河今年约有七万五千人口受灾，根据下曹、窑坡二村调查，秋收每人平均只九小斗谷子，连糠带菜至多能吃到明年阴历正月，到麦收还短四个月粮食。年景较好的五、六、七区，一、二区后半区，平均有七成年景。为着开展今冬明春纺织渡荒，县联合社在九月二十八日开了各区联社长联席会，整顿社务明确方针，又在十月六日全县开了三百七十四个妇女、七十五村合作社长、六十九个铁木工人的大训练班，学习和研究推广加速轮车和铁机（铁机一天能织六丈多），提高技术，提高布的质量，扩大销路。如妇女学会加速轮和铁机可多纺织一倍。过去每月每个妇女平均六斤布，学会后可出十二斤。又因冀南布比沙河质量高，使沙河布逐渐没了销路，如再不把技术提高或质量提高，没销路利润不大，就会阻碍今年纺织运动开展。再是研究如何购存纺织原料，今年全县只种四万亩棉花，能收五十万斤，全县有五万纺织妇女，全年可出三百万斤布，就短二百五十万斤棉花，加速轮推广，全年可出四百五十万斤布，就短四百万斤棉花。大家意见，主要发动群众自己保存原料，现在妇女保存织好的布不下七八万斤。今年到年底粮食都还够吃，织成布换花不换粮，区联合社开设花布店，县联社在褡裢镇设花店，帮助群众收购原料，推销成品。（县联合社）
