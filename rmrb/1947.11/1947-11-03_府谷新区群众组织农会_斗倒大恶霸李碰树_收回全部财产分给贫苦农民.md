    Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 31st. In the newly liberated areas around Qianhousha Village in Fugu, under the leadership of the Shenfu Working Group, the Jiang bandit Baojia system was destroyed, and 120 democratic village regimes were established. Farmers' associations were organized, and the masses actively launched liquidation struggles against the evil landlords. The reactionary landlord Li Pengshu of Housha Village was the most vicious villain in the area, and the masses hated him to the bone. All the property he had obtained by exploiting the people has been recovered, and 186 qing of ripe autumn crops have been distributed to 28 poor peasant households. As of now, 2,400 qing (3 mu per qing) of autumn grain, 25 head of draught animals, and more than 70 shi of grain have been cleared out in 120 villages in the area. All autumn grain land and property have been democratically discussed and distributed by the masses. Twenty-six shi and five dou of grain have been distributed to farmers who are currently short of food. The remaining forty-odd shi are temporarily kept by the farmers' association for the masses' food supply during spring production.

    【新华社晋绥三十一日电】府谷前后沙寨一带新解放区，在神府了工作团领导下，摧毁蒋匪保甲制度，建立了一百廿个民主村政权，并组织农会，群众积极向恶霸地主进行清算斗争。后沙寨的反动大地主李碰树是当地最凶恶的坏蛋，群众恨之入骨，已将其剥削老百姓得来的财产，全部收回，一百八十六垧已熟的秋禾，分给了二十八户贫苦农民。截至目前，该区一百二十村，已清算出秋禾二千四百垧（每垧三亩），耕畜二十五头，粮食七十余石，全部秋禾地及财物已经群众民主讨论分配，抽出二十六石五斗粮食分给目前缺粮农民，尚余四十余石，暂由农会保存，以备群众明春生产时的口粮。
