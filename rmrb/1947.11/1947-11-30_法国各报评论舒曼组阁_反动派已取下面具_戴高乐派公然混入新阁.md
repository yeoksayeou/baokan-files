Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th. TASS, Paris: On the morning of the 24th, when the local press learned of the figures forming the French reactionary new government, they emphasized two facts: (1) It can now be completely determined that Schuman obtained the votes of De Gaulle from the so-called "mixed group," and therefore obtained the necessary majority. (2) The government includes those who are openly De Gaullists. For example, Mayer, who obtained the important position of Minister of Finance and Economy, is De Gaulle's closest partner, as is Coste-Floret, who supported De Gaulle's advocated dictatorial constitutional principles. Therefore, Blum's theory of the so-called "Third Force" immediately vanished. A well-known political commentator in Paris said: Schuman has personally led De Gaulle's "Trojan horse" (see Homer's epic, in which soldiers were hidden in the belly of a wooden horse and entered the city to conquer it; here it can be interpreted as a fifth column), represented by Foglio, Mayer, and Malraux, into the government. Even before the composition of the government was announced, the "Volunteer" newspaper stated: "The situation is very clear. The reactionaries have removed their masks, and they will rule behind Schuman. De Gaulle is looming behind Schuman." L'Humanité forcefully stated: "Schuman means increasing the heavy burden of taxes on the working people, small shopkeepers, artisans, and farmers, meaning the starvation of the elderly, those living on pensions, and those living on salaries, meaning forced labor for civil servants and the demise of social education." But the newspaper emphasized: "There is a force that can prevent this from happening, and that is the French people. The people have the final say, and the cause of freedom and the motherland will win."

　　法国各报评论舒曼组阁 　 反动派已取下面具
    戴高乐派公然混入新阁
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】塔斯社巴黎讯：二十四日清晨，此间报界获悉法反动新政府的组成人物时，都强调两点事实：（一）现在可以完全确定舒曼从所谓“混合集团”中获得了戴高乐的票数，因此才得到必需的多数。（二）政府中包括了那些公开的戴高乐派。如获得财政经济部长此一重职的迈耶，是戴高乐最亲密的合作者，还有科斯特·佛洛里，曾拥护戴高乐所主张的独裁宪法原则。因此，勃鲁姆之所谓“第三种力量”的理论立即烟消云散。巴黎的一个著名政论家说：舒曼已亲自把由佛各里、迈耶和马洛基所代表的戴高乐的“特罗伊木马”（见荷马之史诗，木马腹中藏有战士，混入城内，攻克城市，此处可作第五纵队解）牵进政府里来了。甚至在政府组成分子未发表前，“义勇军”报即称：“形势很清楚，反动派已取下了面具，它们将在舒曼之背后实行统治，戴高乐已在舒曼背后隐然出现。”人道报力称：“舒曼即意味着在劳动人民、小店主、工匠和农民身上，增加赋税之重担，意味着老人、靠养老金过活的人和薪给生活者的饿死，意味着对公务员的强迫劳动以及社会教育的沦亡。”但该报强调指出：“有一种力量可以阻止此种情况之出现，这就是法国人民，人民最后决定一切，自由和祖国的事业将赢得胜利。”
