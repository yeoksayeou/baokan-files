    Millstones Turn in Every Village, Eagerly Grinding Grain for the Counter-Offensive

    [This Dispatch from the city of LiCheng] The Caozhuang Village in the Fifth District held a meeting to discuss the early delivery of grain for the counter-offensive. Militia member Liu Wenshun said, "If the army wins battles, our rear area production must also win victories. Our village hasn't finished tilling the land yet, let's organize people to push it." Woman Zhang Shuanglian said, "There's still work in the fields now, you men go to the fields, we women will organize to push the public grain." Dong Huanying said, "In the past, we poor people had no land and couldn't contribute. This year we've turned over and are pushing grain for the counter-offensive, our women must guarantee to grind three rounds of rice." Guo Jiaolan said, "Autumn plowing won't delay pushing public grain." Five of the twenty millstones in the village were broken. Carpenter Duan Xinfu and two others volunteered to help repair the millstones and push grain for the counter-offensive. After the meeting, everyone proposed: "The army fights against Chiang Kai-shek at the front, we compete to push grain for the counter-offensive." "Autumn plowing and grain pushing go hand in hand." The next day, apart from a few sick people, all seven women in the village organized sixty-three women, some pushing, some sifting, not a single millstone was idle. Because there were many people but few millstones, they divided into two shifts to take turns pushing, some carried spinning wheels, some held needlework, and did it during breaks. Wang Songqi's mother was fifty-one years old. She said happily while pushing the millstone: "We must pick out the stones and sorghum in the rice completely, we must let our army eat good rice and thoroughly eliminate Chiang Kai-shek." Now the whole village has formed a movement to grind public grain day and night. Sixty-three women grind 1,914 catties of rice a day and still manage to cook. (Wen Qi, Huan Yang)

    [This Dispatch from the city of WuAn] Liu Tianjing Village in the Tenth District is competing to hand over public grain. The peasants who have turned over said, "When we turned over, we proposed a competition to see who actively leads the masses; this time in storing grain, we will also compete to see whose millet is ground the best, whose grain is dried the best, and whose public grain is ground the earliest?" A Public Security Officer said, "I didn't pour the grain I harvested into the jar, I dried it on the roof for two days to prepare to grind rice and hand over public grain." Under the leadership of the cadres, a heatwave of grinding public grain formed throughout the village. There are four millstones in the village. The masses discussed not letting the millstones idle day or night and taking turns grinding in shifts. Now the whole village has ground the public grain and is just waiting to hand it over. (Liu Bin)

    [This Dispatch from the city of ChangZhi] In Nantianhe, Second District, the masses are very enthusiastic about the autumn storage work this time. When the village cadres announced the amount of public grain to be collected this autumn, the masses below quietly said: This year's burden is not heavy. We think the army is several times larger than before, so it should be more than last year, but it is not more at all. Everyone clamored: This year we must grind it finer and faster, and hand it over earlier so that the army can eat well and fight Chiang Kai-shek. The ancients said: "An army moves on its stomach." Originally scheduled to hand over in ten days, the masses will complete it in seven days, especially the eleventh group plans to hand over in four days. Slogans were shouted in a chorus below, all saying: "Cultivate deeply and meticulously to produce more grain, it is appropriate to hand over some public grain, men help each other to cultivate the autumn fields, women help each other to grind public grain, the army eats and fights Chiang Kai-shek." After the meeting, the situation of the meeting was spread to the ears of the old ladies, and the old people were discussing on the street: "Now we need grain for the counter-offensive. We are really living in heaven now, and we only produce this little public grain a year! It is not more than what those village chiefs and community leaders used to eat!" Some said: "The public grain needed is not more than what the rats eat." Now the millstones in the whole village do not rest day and night, and the masses are competing to hand over grain for the counter-offensive. (Huai Yong)

    [This Dispatch from the city of HuGuan] On the night of October 14th, Dajing Village held a meeting of mutual aid team leaders. After visiting everyone with the victorious news of the great counter-offensive, they then proposed how we should support the great counter-offensive. Chang Huai said: "We should take the lead in grinding the public grain first." After this discussion, they immediately divided the work to publicize the victory news to the groups and dining halls. The next day, the whole village knew that they were going to attack Nanjing and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive. The political director Li Erfei's sixty-three-year-old mother and a twelve-year-old child ground more than 180 catties of public grain rice in two nights, and said: "I am so happy, it would be great to catch Chiang Kai-shek." An Liang, who had just turned over, did not pay public grain last year. This year, after turning over, he heard that he was going to attack Nanjing and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive. Before the autumn harvest was over, he ground more than 100 catties of rice to hand over public grain. More than 20 households including Bian Ze have prepared public grain rice. Now, every morning in Dajing, the whole village's yards and millstones are in a mess of drying and grinding public grain, forming a rush to dry and grind public grain movement.
