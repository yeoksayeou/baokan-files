　　Jilu Yu Military Supply Clothing Factory
    Overcoming Mud and Water Obstacles
    Insisting on Completing Tasks
    [Our Newspaper Jilu Yu Eighth Dispatch] This year's summer and autumn months have brought continuous rain, with water accumulating waist-deep around villages and even inside villages in slightly low-lying areas, and knee-deep in shallower areas. The Jilu Yu Military Supply Clothing Factory, for the clothing of the thousands of troops on the front lines of the great counter-offensive, launched a crash work campaign in such difficult circumstances. To complete their tasks, comrades in the materials section ran around everywhere, wading through mud and water, hundreds of miles away for some, dozens of miles for others, ensuring the supply of materials. Those from various sections who came to the factory to collect materials also had to pass through mud and water of varying depths, especially the second and fourth sections, whose villages were surrounded by water. Therefore, each time a large cart carrying cloth and cotton arrived, people had to replace the cart at half a mile from the village. Section chiefs, political commissars, instructors, and quartermasters all participated in this arduous and honorable work. The rest, who were inspecting, collecting, distributing, and packing in various villages, carried hemp ropes on their backs and transported goods back and forth in the mud and water, undertaking the transportation tasks of the entire factory. Tens of thousands of square feet of cloth, tens of thousands of pounds of cotton, and miscellaneous materials were all transported by them. As soon as the transportation team comrades went out, they ran in the mud and water like moorhens. Sometimes, when a cart was stuck in a mud puddle, they replaced the animals to pull and drag it out, and sometimes they would also get stuck in the mud. As soon as they set off, they were wet. The leaders of the factory were no exception. From ×× to ×× was only sixty miles, but because of the rain and high water, they had to detour twenty miles. Comrades Zhang Deqing, Yuan Xiushan, and Zhang Junde were responsible for this long-distance transportation work. Enemy planes often came to harass them during the day, and at night it was difficult to distinguish the road, adding to the difficulties of the mud and water. They drove and protected the carts, sometimes wading in the water, sometimes lifting the carts. A sense of responsibility drove away sleepiness. On the evening of September 15th, the transport team encountered enemy planes strafing during their journey. At eight o'clock the next morning, when they were still four miles from home, the cart got stuck in the water, and the sound of enemy planes bombing could be heard nearby. At this time, Comrade Zhang led everyone to move the goods on the cart to a suitable place for cover. After two days and two nights, they finally overcame all kinds of difficulties, and ×× sets of shirts and ×× pairs of cloth socks were transported to their destination.

　　冀鲁豫军供被服厂
    突破泥水阻碍
    坚持完成任务
    【本报冀鲁豫八日电】今年夏秋几月来的阴雨，村子周围甚至村子里，稍微低的地方，都积了腰深的水，浅的也要到膝盖，冀鲁豫某军供被服厂，为了前方大反攻的千万军队的衣着，就在这样困难的环境里，突击工作。材料股的同志为完成任务，他们涉着泥水四外奔跑，远的几百里，近的几十里，保证了材料的供给。各所到厂部领材料，同样要经过或深或浅的泥水，尤其是二、四所，水将他们的住村包围了，因此每次运布运花的大车，离村半里地便得用人的肩膀来代替，不论所长、政委、指导员、司务长等，都参加这件艰苦而荣誉的工作。其余到各村检查、收发、打包的，都是背着麻绳在泥水里往返、运输，担任着全厂的运输任务，××万方尺布，××万斤棉花和零星材料，都是依靠他们运来。运输队员同志们只要一出门，就象水鸡似的在泥水里奔跑，有时大车陷到泥潭中，他们便代替牲口架辕，往外拉向外拖，有时也会陷在泥潭里，只要出发，身上就是湿的，厂部的各位首长也毫不例外，从××到××只有六十多里地，因为下雨水大，就得多绕二十里路。张德清、袁秀山、张俊德三同志，就担任了这个长途的运输工作，白天敌机常来袭扰，黑夜本来就很难辩清道路，又加上泥水困难就更多了。他们驾护着大车，有时下水，有时抬车，责任心赶跑了磕睡虫。九月十五号傍晚，运输队行动中遇见敌机扫射，第二天八点钟，离家尚有四里地时车陷在水里，近处又有敌机轰炸的声音，这时张同志领着大伙，把车上东西搬到适当处所掩蔽起来，经过两天两夜，终于克服种种困难，××套衬衣、××双布袜运到了目的地。
