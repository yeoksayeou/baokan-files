　　Kunshan Flood Relief
    ——An Lan Conference Communication One
    ·Jun Qian·
    From the road there to Shilipu, a 7820-meter-long section of the dike, there are 46 dams of various sizes, situated in the middle of the water on all sides. From Shilipu to Jinkou Town in the southeast, there is a canal over 70 miles long. On the west bank of Dongping Lake is the Jinshan dangerous section from Jinshan to Shangshilipu. Every year during the summer and autumn rainy seasons, the rainwater from Juancheng and Yunbei pours down, converging on the Shilipu and Daimiao Town areas, surrounding the dangerous section. Moreover, whenever there is a major flood in the Yellow River, it is also when the canal and Dongping Lake's water levels surge. The people of Kunshan must defend the Yellow River dike, protect the dangerous section, and also guard the canal dike and monitor the Jinshan dam. This year, during the Yellow River's major flood season, when the dangerous section was at its most critical, Kunshan was almost entirely disturbed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops. On July 30th, all the dams simultaneously reported emergencies, and more than 3,000 people participated in the rescue. Dai, the section chief, and Yu, the deputy section chief of the repair and defense section, were responsible for technical leadership. Yang Gang, the deputy secretary of the county party committee, led the rescue at the 19th dam, personally participating in transporting earth. Wang Huwen, the secretary general of the 7th Special Prefecture, and Chen Ke, the county magistrate, led the rescue of the 8th dam. Director Wang and the masses carried stones together, and County Magistrate Chen used baskets to dig earth at the back of the riverbank. To climb the 8-meter-high dike and run the 330-meter-long dam body, he ran back and forth, competing with the masses, which moved the masses so that no one was willing to lag behind, and the engineering team was busily bundling willow stone gabions and driving piles. At that time, the roaring and rumbling giant waves drowned out the people's rescue calls, and submerged the loud sounds of pile driving and stone throwing, and the giant tongue more than a zhang high, surged by the angry waves because of the dam's head resistance, threatened to engulf people at any time. After × days and nights of rescue, the flood's fierce flames were finally temporarily resisted, so that the dam received temporary stability. During the second major flood on August 17th, not only were the 8th and 19th dams still under pressure, but the 9th dam increased its burden because a five-zhang section of the 8th dam was twisted away. It collapsed 63 meters due to the scouring of the surging backflow, and the middle section of the 12th dam also had 40 meters scoured and collapsed. Just at this extremely critical moment, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops invaded again, pressing temporary strongholds at Daimiao and Shilipu. County Magistrate Chen, who was responsible for leading the war support headquarters and food and lodging stations, also shouldered the heavy responsibility of flood prevention. He patrolled the dangerous section of more than ten miles every day, and once had not rested for seven days and nights. When the enemy was stationed at Shilipu and the rescue project could not be carried out smoothly, he disguised himself as a peasant, carrying an iron hoe and a dirt basket, and went to the 8th dam to rescue. Deputy Secretary Yang Gang was discovered by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops while rescuing at Luli, and Luli was surrounded at night, and more than 70 people were arrested. Fortunately, the alert Comrade Yang Gang transferred to the area beforehand and did not suffer harm. On August 10th, when a large number of Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops invaded Yuncheng, Juancheng, and Kunshan in several routes, the dangerous section fell into an adverse environment with enemies on three sides. County Magistrate Chen and Comrade Yang Gang, who led the rescue, hurriedly crossed the river at the most critical moment, but at that time the enemy had invaded the river bank, and there were no ferries in the river. County Magistrate Chen, in ×× village, and Chang Mingguang, the director of the Armed Forces Committee, hurriedly tied a few purlins into a raft and rushed to cross the west bank in the raging waves. Unexpectedly, when crossing to mid-stream, the raft was scattered by the waves. County Magistrate Chen hugged a purlin and was tossed up and down in the turbid waves, washed by the turbid waves for more than ten miles before struggling to escape to the west bank. Later, Comrade Yang Gang took a boat to cross to the west bank, and just as he crossed to mid-stream, a plane suddenly attacked, densely strafing the boat with machine guns. Comrade Yang Gang grabbed a rope on the boat and jumped into the river to escape. In the late August, after the section of the 8th dam, which was responsible for the heavy task of drainage, was twisted five zhang away, after × days and nights of rescue, when the willow stone gabions had just reached the bottom, the enemy suddenly surged in from several routes. The 56 members of the engineering team, under the leadership of Captain Zhang Chaoyi, resolutely and loudly accepted this arduous and glorious task. Zhang Chaoyi mobilized everyone and said: "The common people send materials here, and some people have been killed by planes, cows have been killed, and cars have been damaged, aren't they just for everyone's survival? We must live up to the common people. No matter what the enemy does, we must rescue here and protect the lives of millions of people. We cannot let the common people be flooded even if we die." None of the engineering team members flinched, and all loudly declared their determination to rescue. The day after the mobilization, a large number of enemies came to harass again, and the team members hid in the sorghum fields to take temporary shelter. In the afternoon, after the enemy had passed, they immediately came out of the sorghum fields to rescue. On the third day, the enemy occupied Shilipu, and the 12th dam had collapsed to less than one meter wide, and the chaff on the 13th dam's upper part was also dislodged from the dam head due to the falling of the hinges, and it looked like it would be washed away by the water. Therefore, Zhang Chaoyi ran to Malou and said to the masses: "Are you afraid of the enemy or afraid of the Yellow River water? Now the 13th dam's upper part has cracked, and it looks like it will be washed away, what do you think we should do?" Therefore, the masses of Malou went to the dike. Zhang Chaoyi went to nearby villages to mobilize. Three thousand people went to the dam to rescue that day. After two days and nights of fighting, the Kunshan dangerous section turned from danger to safety.

　　昆山抢险
    ——安澜大会通讯之一
    ·君谦·
    从路那里至十里铺七八二○公尺长的堤段往上，有大小坝四十六道，处于四面水中。十里铺往东南至靳口镇，有七十余里长的运河；在东平湖西岸，则是从金山至上十里铺一段的金山险工。每年夏秋霪雨期，鄄城与郓北的雨水又倾泻而下，汇流至十里铺与戴庙镇一带，将险工包围；而且每当黄河大汛期，也正是运河与东平湖水势暴涨的时候，昆山的人民既要防守黄河大堤抢护险工，又需固守运堤监视金山坝。今年黄河大汛期险工最吃紧的时候，昆山几乎全部为蒋匪军侵扰着。七月三十日，各坝同时告急，参加抢救的群众有三千余人。修防段的戴段长和于副段长，负责技术上的领导；县委副书记杨岗同志，在十九坝上领导抢救，亲身参加运土。七专署秘书主任王虎文和县长陈克等同志，则领导第八坝的抢救。王主任和群众同样扛石，陈县长就用篮子到背河堤下去挖土。要上八公尺高的堤，又要跑三百三十余公尺长的坝身，他一趟一趟的来往奔跑，在和群众比赛，感动得群众谁也不肯落后，工程队则紧张的捆柳石砧、下桩。当时轰鸣咆哮的巨涛，吞没了人们抢救的呼号，淹没了打桩、抛石的巨响，而怒涛因坝头的顶抗所涌起丈多高的巨舌，时有将人卷去的危险。就这样经过×日夜的抢救，终于暂时抗住了洪水的凶焰，使坝埽得到暂时的稳定。八月十七日第二次大汛时，不但第八与第十九坝仍在吃紧，而第九坝因第八坝被扭去了五丈的一段，即增加了它的负担，它因汹涌回溜的掏刷，致坝坍了六十三公尺，十二坝的中段，亦有四十公尺被掏坍。就在这样极端危急的关头，而蒋匪军又侵来，在戴庙、十里铺等处，按了临时据点。陈县长，他负责战勤指挥部和食宿站的领导，又担当了防汛的重责，他每天要在十几里的险工上巡查一遍，曾七日夜不得休息。在敌人住了十里铺已不能从容进行抢险工程时，他还化装农民，扛着铁镢挑着土筐，到第八坝上去抢险。副书记杨岗同志，在路那里抢险时，被蒋匪军发觉，于夜间包围了路那里，抓去七十余名群众，幸而机警的杨岗同志于事前转移了地区，未遭毒手。八月十日，大批蒋匪军又分路侵入郓鄄及昆山时，险工陷于三面是敌人的恶劣环境，领导抢险的陈县长及杨岗同志，于最危急时仓促渡河，而那时敌人已侵至河边，河里已没有渡船，陈县长在××村和武委会主任常明光等，仓促用几根檩扎了个筏子，在怒涛中往河西岸抢渡，不料渡至中流，木筏被浪打散，陈县长抱着一根檩，在浊浪中被打得翻腾上下，被浊浪冲了十余里，才挣扎到西岸脱险。后来杨岗同志乘船往西岸抢渡，刚渡到中流，而飞机突然袭来，以机枪对船密集扫射，杨岗同志抓着船上的一根绳跳入河中，才免于难。八月的下旬，担负排水重责，第八坝被扭去五丈的一段后，经×日夜的抢救，下的柳石砧刚着了底时，敌人突然分路涌来，五十六名工程队，在队长张朝义领导下，就坚决而响亮的接受了这个艰巨光荣的任务。张朝义动员大家道：“老百姓送材料跑到这里来，有些被飞机打死人、打死牛、打坏车，还不是为了大家活命，咱要对起老百姓，不管敌人怎样，咱要在此抢险，保住几百万人的性命，咱死了也不能叫老百姓挨淹”。所有工程队员，没有一个退缩的，都响亮的声明了抢险的决心。动员的次日，大批敌人又来袭扰，队员都藏在高粱地里，作暂时躲避，至下午敌人过尽，即马上从高粱地中出来抢险。第三日敌人侵占了十里铺，十二坝已坍得不及一公尺宽，十三坝的秕料上埽也因掉蛰脱离了坝头，眼看要为水冲坏，于是张朝义跑到马楼向群众道：“你们是怕敌人还是怕黄水？现在十三坝的埽已裂了缝子，眼看要被冲走，愈看怎么办呢？”因此马楼的群众都上了堤，张朝义又亲到附近村去动员，这天上提抢险的有三千人，经二昼夜的搏斗，昆山险工转危为安了。
