　　Su Dian School District Teachers Correct Their Stance
  　Wholeheartedly Nurturing Poor and Hired Peasants' Children
    [This newspaper's Changzhi News] In order to enable a large number of liberated peasant children to enroll in school this winter, and to truly put the schools on a path of serving the masses, the Su Dian School District of the Second District convened a meeting of all teachers on November 4th to discuss why the school had been lackluster in the first half of the year, and how to take care of poor and hired children's literacy this winter. During the discussion, everyone realized that the reason why the school had been lackluster in the first half of the year was that it had not taken care of the poor and hired children. Mostly it was using children from rich peasant and upper-middle peasant families as cadres, and the poor and hired children were still being oppressed. For example, in Su Dian School, they used children from upper-middle peasant families as league leaders, squad leaders, and class leaders. For example, Niu Fumin, as league leader, used orders to oppress liberated children, telling poor and hired children to sweep the yard, while he didn't lift a finger, saying, "Sweep quickly, you can't go home for dinner until it's done." For example, Zhang Baoyin was arrogant and thought he wrote well, bullying the liberated children, scolding them when he spoke, and no one dared to interfere. A rich peasant child from Dong Shenjia Village didn't enroll himself, and even threatened the liberated children, "If you go to the school again, we will beat you." Under these circumstances, everyone realized that the reason why the school hadn't done well was because the poor and hired children weren't in charge. A teacher from Su Dian said, "If we want to run the school well this winter, we must first use poor and hired boys and girls as the backbone, draw a clear class line, find typical poor and hired children as role models, and the school will definitely improve." Cha Haoze, a liberated teacher from Feng Village, said, "This winter, we must let the poor and hired children be in charge, guaranteeing that the liberated children will enroll in school and become literate. We must use the poor and hired children to mobilize other poor and hired children, and patiently teach them, guaranteeing that they will not be oppressed." Li Qingfang, a teacher from Fen Shang, said, "In the past, we only took care of the older children and those with some education, and didn't value the poor and hired children. From now on, we must turn our backs on that and treat the poor and hired children as our own." On the spot, everyone decided to compete to win the red flag, setting out specific conditions to guarantee that the school would be run well. (Guo Zheng, Xiang Wen)

　　苏店学区教员端正立场
  　全心培育贫雇子弟
    【本报长治讯】二区苏店学区为了今冬使翻身农民子弟大量入学，学校要真正走上为群众服务的道路，于十一月四号召开全学区教员会议，讨论前半年学校为啥不起劲，今冬如何照顾贫雇儿童识字。在讨论中，大家都认识了前半年学校不起劲的原因，是没照顾贫雇儿童，大部用的是富农上中农家儿童当干部，贫雇儿童还是受压迫。如苏店学校，就是用的上中农家儿童当团长、队长、班长等。如牛福民当团长，就用命令来压迫翻身儿童，叫贫雇儿童扫院，他不动手，说：“快扫，不扫完不能回家吃饭”。如张保寅，自高自大，以为自己写字不错，欺压翻身儿童，说话就骂，谁也不敢管。东申家庄富农儿童自己不入学，还威胁翻身儿童“你们再去书房非打你们不行”。在这种情况下，大家都认识学校没搞好就是因为贫雇儿童没当家。苏店教员说：“今冬学校想搞好，先以贫雇男女儿童做骨干，划清阶级界限，找贫雇典型儿童做火车头，学校一定能搞好”。冯村翻身教员察好则说：“咱们今冬一定要用贫雇儿童当家，保证使翻身儿童入了学，识上字，要以贫雇儿童来动员贫雇儿童，耐心的来教他们，保证他们不受压迫。”坟上教员李青芳说：“咱们以前光顾了大儿童、有点文化的儿童，没有把贫雇儿童看重，咱们今后要扭转屁股，把贫雇儿童作为咱们的亲子弟来教”。当场大家决定竞赛夺红旗，订出具体条件，保证把学校办好。（郭正、相文）
