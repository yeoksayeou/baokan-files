　　Yuanshi Cadres, Militia Instructors Organize Political Offensive Groups
　　Deeply Penetrate Enemy Areas to Propagandize the Great Counteroffensive
　　Crush the Chiang Bandit Rule, and Help the Masses Overturn Their Lives
　　[This newspaper's Yuanshi dispatch] In the week that Yuanshi County, Jixi, launched a political offensive to crush the Chiang bandit rule and publicize the great counteroffensive, it achieved remarkable results. The masses were jubilant and talked about the great counteroffensive, actively helping our army; many Chiang Kai-shek puppet personnel contacted us or fled with their guns; some masses spontaneously rose up to distribute wealth, food, vegetables, and firewood, and divide up the land. At the beginning of the month, the county, combined with the troops, formed many political offensive groups composed of a large number of cadres, militia, and teachers, who actively moved into border areas and enemy-occupied areas to publicize the great counteroffensive, win over and disintegrate the Chiang Kai-shek puppet army, and help the masses overturn their lives. During this period, Section Chief Zhang of the sub-district political department personally carried special slide films of the People's Liberation Army's history of struggle and the People's Liberation Army's slogans, and personally explained them, showing them in rotation in five villages including Su Yang, Yu Ke, Niu Jialou, and Long Zheng. The masses braved the early winter cold to watch. When the images of Commander-in-Chief Zhu and Chairman Mao appeared on the screen, they all excitedly applauded. In a week, except for a few villages about five miles from the city's suburbs, almost every village held mass meetings and puppet family meetings. The masses wanted to know the real situation of the People's Liberation Army's great counteroffensive and enthusiastically participated. Each meeting had more than several hundred people. In the southeast of the city, more than a thousand people attended the meeting in Yincun, and more than two thousand people attended the meeting in Zhangye, five or six hundred households north of the city on the second day. Now the People's Liberation Army's Double Tenth Declaration, slogans, counteroffensive leaflets, slogans, cartoons, and maps have spread throughout the villages. The masses are vying to watch and listen. Often, before the staff has finished painting, a large group of men, women, and children have gathered around. A large map in the newly liberated Dongbao Village is watched all day long. In addition, in villages where we had no political power before and in newly liberated villages, such as Dongbao Village, political power has been initially established, and the basic masses have spontaneously risen up to overturn their lives, demanding to divide the land and distribute money. The masses of Xifangzhong, west of the city, who had been robbed of food by the enemy, divided up and ate the autumn vegetables in the fields of the fleeing landlords. The masses of Dongbao Village dug out copper coins as big as half a room and as tall as a person in the home of Gao Loushan, a large landlord who owned fifteen qing of land and six wives. The masses said, "In the past, we had never been to people's homes, let alone seen so much money. Today, we have finally opened our eyes!" During the seven-day political offensive, people's hearts were greatly uplifted, and the masses complained about the heinous crimes of Chiang Kai-shek puppet Wei Yonghe's bandit army in looting and conscripting soldiers. Mao Yi Village patient ××× said, "I was sick and borrowed a dou of wheat from someone, ground it into flour and kept it for eating, but the enemy robbed it. Even a few eggs that others gave me were also robbed." Some said, "The enemy is a bottomless pit, always wanting things, and never filling it." Some people said, "The enemy comes out to rob things and arrest people. They have no serious business. It seems that they are not going to last." A puppet family member in Quancun, north of the city, saw that our army was disciplined and said, "In the past, I only heard people (referring to the enemy) say that the Eighth Route Army was not good in this way or that way, but now I see that it is much stronger than my child being a soldier." They asked us to attack Yuanshi City quickly. They said, "If we take Yuanshi City, we can live a peaceful life!" Some masses spontaneously asked to help the army repair fortifications and carry stretchers. The women said, "We can't do anything else, but we can sew and wash. When our own army comes, if the shoes don't fit, we can sew them. We are not afraid of the smell. What's so smelly about it? As long as the shoes are sewn well, the comrades can wear them and chase the enemy away quickly and get guns." After the counteroffensive propaganda, the masses felt that Chiang Kai-shek currency was no longer working and took money to buy things. The masses of Xiawang Village, northwest of the city, organized two people to take more than one million yuan at a time to the Dongguan market in the city to buy goods with my help. The families of ordinary puppet soldiers were even more disturbed, and they tearfully told of their suffering. Most of the family members were willing to take advantage of this great counteroffensive opportunity to let their family members come back and atone for their crimes, so as to avoid death. As soon as the meetings were over, puppet family members asked our cadres for safe passage permits issued by the special commissioner's office and the sub-district. They hid the safe passage permits and took them into the city to give to their sons who were puppet soldiers, instructing them to keep them carefully and prepare to use them when they had the opportunity to sneak away. Some puppet soldiers contacted us one after another, and each person always left us with dozens of bullets each time they contacted us. ××× alone in the city has recently brought us more than two hundred bullets (including three hundred and forty bullets before). Puppet soldiers and fleeing landlords also continued to run back during our offensive; The fleeing landlords of Jiecun felt that they could not live outside and said, "Just struggle when we go back, it's better than being outside!" So three families brought more than a dozen carts of things back to the village. Cheng Erwu, a soldier from the first squad of the ninth squadron of the Yuanshi Security Police Team (from Beichucun Village, northwest of the city), took advantage of his going out to get a car and ran back from Chicun Village with a Hanyang-made rifle and thirty-eight bullets. I gave him money in accordance with the reward regulations. In addition, four puppet soldiers recently ran back from Zhangye Village.
　　The main reasons for the county's achievements in the political offensive are: (1) Organizing all the forces that could be organized (from all departments) and using a variety of methods (posting leaflets, writing slogans, cartoons, maps, especially drawing cartoons and maps played a big role), and holding all kinds of meetings (mass meetings, puppet family meetings, merchant meetings, large meetings, small meetings, individual conversations, and individual conversations with puppet family members played a big role) to fully carry out the political offensive. (2) Seizing the right opportunity, the political offensive was closely integrated with the war situation. This political offensive began when the Chiang Kai-shek Hu Third Army in Shijiazhuang was wiped out in Qingfengdian and the Jinchaji People's Liberation Army was engaged in the Battle of Shijiazhuang. (3) For villages in the forefront that were not easy to develop under enemy rule, work was carried out by combining with the troops to carry out surprise attacks. For example, in Fangzhong (five miles from the city), when the enemy came out to harass us, our army fought the enemy on the edge of the village, covering the political offensive personnel to hold meetings and draw pictures in the village as usual. The masses were very impressed. (4) Helping the masses solve specific difficulties. For example, the masses in the fifth district had no salt to eat, so I got it from the rear and let the masses exchange it for food. The masses in Xiazhu Village felt that Chiang Kai-shek currency was useless, so they were organized to sell it to the outside world. The masses in Fangzhong and Dongbao Village had nothing to eat or burn, so they were helped to divide food and firewood. (5) Discovering personnel from the masses in a timely manner and organizing and mobilizing them to help carry out the work. For example, personnel who had lived and worked in our area, who had been captured and released by us, and who had traveled far and wide and knew the area were organized to help publicize and explain our policies, strength, and the victorious counteroffensive situation, effectively dispelling the doubts and distrust of some of the masses towards us.
　　Now that Shijiazhuang has been liberated by our army, people's hearts are even more uplifted, and Chiang Kai-shek puppets are even more panicked. Under this favorable opportunity, the political offensive is being carried out more deeply in the suburbs of Yuanshi City. (Chun Yi)

　　元氏干部民兵教员组织政攻组
  　深入敌区宣传大反攻
    摧垮蒋匪统治帮助群众翻身
    【本报元氏讯】冀西元氏县在开展摧垮蒋匪统治、宣传大反攻政治攻势的一星期中，获显著成绩。群众兴高采烈纷纷谈论大反攻，积极帮助我军；很多蒋伪人员与我接头，或携枪逃来；有的群众自动起来分财分粮、分菜、分柴、分田。该县月初由大批干部、民兵、教员结合部队组成很多政攻组，到边沿区、敌占区主动活动，宣传大反攻，争取与瓦解蒋伪军，帮助群众翻身。在此期间，分区政治部张科长亲携分政特制解放军斗争史、解放军口号等幻灯影片，并亲自讲解，在苏羊、于科、牛家楼、龙正等五村轮回放映，群众冒着初冬寒风前往观看。当朱总司令毛主席的影像出现于幕布时，都兴奋的鼓起掌来。一周间，除城近郊五里地左右的几个村子外，差不多村村召开了群众大会、伪属会。群众想知道解放军大反攻的真实情形，都踊跃参加，每次大会均在数百人以上，在城东南因村到会的有一千多人，二日在城北五、六百户的张掖开会时曾到了二千多人。现人民解放军双十宣言、口号及反攻传单、标语、漫画、地图已遍布各村，群众争相观看听讲，往往工作人员还没画完，男女老少就围了一大堆人。新解放的董堡村的一幅大图前整天都有人观看。此外，在以前没有我政权及新解放的村庄，如董堡等村，都初步建立了政权，基本群众自动起来翻身，要求分田地分钱财。城西方冢群众被敌人抢得没吃的了，就把逃亡地主地里的秋菜分吃了。董堡群众在曾拥有十五顷地、六个老婆的大地主高楼山家里，挖出有半间屋子大一人来高的铜制钱，群众说：“过去咱们根本没到过人家家里，更没有见过这么多钱，今天才算开了开眼界！”七天政攻中，人心大为振奋，群众纷纷诉说蒋伪魏永和匪军抢掠抓丁的滔天罪行。毛遗村病人×××说：“我病了借了人家一斗麦子，磨成面放着吃，谁知让敌人给抢走了。连别人送我的几个鸡蛋也叫抢走了。”有的说：“敌人是没底坑，老是要东西，永填不满。”有的人说：“敌人出来就抢东西，抓人，没正经事，眼看就不行了。”城北泉村一个伪属看到我军纪律严明，他说：“过去光听人家（指敌人）说八路军这不好那不好，现在我看了可比俺孩儿当那兵强。”他们要求我们赶快攻打元氏城，他们说：“打了元氏城就可以好好过安生日子啦！”有的群众自动要求帮助军队修工事、抬担架。妇女们说：“咱们不能干别的，可是能缝缝洗洗的，自己的军队来了，鞋不合适咱可以给缝缝，俺不怕臭，这臭什么？只要缝好了鞋，同志们穿上撵敌人跑的快，能得枪”。经反攻宣传后，群众感到蒋币不行了，纷纷拿钱买东西。城西北下汪村群众在我帮助下由两人一次带着一百多万元去城东关集上买成货。一般伪军家属更为动荡，他（她）们一群群泪星星的诉说他（她）们的痛苦。大多数家属都愿趁此大反攻时机让家人回来以功赎罪，免得死掉。各地刚开完会就有伪属向我干部要专署及分区印发的平安通行证。他们将平安通行证掩藏着带进城里交给当伪军的子弟，嘱咐他好好保存，准备有机会偷跑时使用。有的伪军纷纷与我接头，每人每次接头总要给我们留下几十发子弹。城里×××一个人仅最近就给我们弄出二百多发子弹（连前共三百四十发）。伪军及逃亡地主在我攻势中也不断跑回；解村逃亡地主感到在外边没法过，说：“回去斗争就斗争，怎样也比在外边强！”于是有三家带回十几大车东西重回村里。元氏保警队第九中队一班战士程二物件（城西北北褚村人）趁外出要车时，携一枝汉阳造步枪三十八发子弹从池村跑回，我当依奖励条例给了钱。此外张掖村近也跑回来四个伪军。
    该县在政攻中取得以上成绩的主要原因是：（一）组织了一切能组织的力量（各部门的），运用了多种多样的方式（张贴传单涂写标语、漫画、地图，特别是画漫画、地图作用大），开各种各样的会议（群众会、伪属会、商人会、大会、小会、个别谈话、对伪属特别是个别谈话作用大），全力开展政治攻势。（二）适合时机，政攻与战争形势结合得紧。此次政攻开始于石家庄蒋胡第三军北上清风店被歼与晋察冀解放军正进行石家庄大战之际。（三）最前边敌人统治下不易开展的村庄，结合着部队去突击进行工作。如在方冢（距城五里）时，敌人出扰，而我军在村边与敌人打，掩护政攻人员安稳的在村里照常开会、画图。群众看了都颇为敬佩。（四）帮助群众解决了具体困难问题。如五区群众没食盐吃，我就从后边弄去，让群众拿粮食换。下注村群众感到蒋币不沾了，就组织他们集中起来去向外推销，方冢、董堡群众没吃的烧的，就帮助分粮分柴。（五）及时从群众中发现人员，组织动员他们帮助进行工作。如组织了曾在我方住过、工作过的，曾被我俘虏而又释放的以及出过远门知道地方广的人员，去帮助宣传讲解我方的政策、力量、胜利反攻形势，有效的解除了部分群众对我怀疑不信任的心理。
    现石家庄已为我军解放，人心更加振奋，蒋伪更加恐慌，在此有利时机下，政攻正在元氏城郊更加深入进行着。（纯一）
