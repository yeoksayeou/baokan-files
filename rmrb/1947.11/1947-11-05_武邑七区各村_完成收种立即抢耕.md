Villages in the Seventh District of Wuyi
    Complete Harvesting and Planting, Immediately Rush to Plough

    [This newspaper's Jinan, 31st dispatch] After villages in the Seventh District of Wuyi mutually assisted each other to complete the rush harvesting and planting, they are now launching a sudden campaign for autumn ploughing. On the 11th of this month, village cadres from Li Xiaozhuang Village held a meeting of mutual aid team leaders. When summarizing the wheat planting, everyone said, "Thanks to the mutual aid, we planted more wheat this year than in previous years." Statistics show that the village averaged more than two mu of wheat land per person. When discussing future tasks, Li Guanzhen suggested, "There are many grasshoppers this year. We must plough all the bare land to prevent locust plagues." Then, Li Weiyi said, "When farming, don't forget the saying, 'Early autumn ploughing, late spring ploughing.' The ground is wet this year. As long as we plough the autumn land well, it will be easy to sow next year." Everyone unanimously supported his opinion and immediately made an autumn ploughing plan. The village has seventy-six livestock and forty ploughs. The 1,308 mu of bare land can be ploughed in half a month. When the village chief of Ximeng Village mobilized the masses for autumn ploughing, he said, "We can't hold the seedlings every spring because we didn't plough the land after autumn. This year, we must do a good job in autumn ploughing to ensure that the seedlings are in good condition next spring." The masses unanimously responded and immediately made a plan, and then started working. Xu Xiuhua, director of the Zhao Zhou Village Farmers' Association, and the team leaders, based on their experience of planting good seedlings in early autumn, mobilized the entire village and decided to have a ten-day autumn ploughing sprint period from August 25th to September 5th. The plan is for twelve ploughs to plough fourteen mu a day, and the bare land can be completely eliminated in ten days. Currently, a surge of autumn ploughing is being launched in all villages in the district.

    武邑七区各村
    完成收种立即抢耕
    【本报冀南三十一日电】武邑七区互助起来完成抢收抢种后，现正突击秋耕。本月十一日，李小庄村干召开各互助组长会，总结种麦时，大家都说：“沾了互助的光，今年比往年种的麦子多。”统计全村每人平均麦地二亩多。讨论今后任务时，李关贞提出：“今年蚂蚱多，咱们一定得把所有的白地全耕过来，才能防止蚂蚱成灾。”接着李维一说：“种地别忘俗话说的早秋耕、晚春耕，今年地湿，只要把秋地翻好，明年才好下种。”大家一致拥护他的意见，随订出秋耕计划。全村七十六头牲口，四十张犁，一千三百零八亩白地，半月即可耕完。西孟村村长动员群众秋耕时说：“年年春天拿不住苗，都是因为秋后没耕地，今年一定把秋耕闹好，明春按苗才有保证。”群众一致响应，当即订出计划，接着就动手干。赵周村农会主任徐秀花及各组长根据早秋种好按苗的经验，动员全村，决议自八月二十五日至九月五日为十天秋耕突击期，计划十二张犁一天即耕一十四亩，十天即可完全消灭白地，现全区各村已掀起突击秋耕热潮。
