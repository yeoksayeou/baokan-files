[Taiyue Dispatch, November 21st] Wangjiayuan, a model village in Qinyuan, completed its autumn plowing on schedule in twenty days, from October 16th to November 6th, for all 1,630 mu of autumn land with 21 head of livestock. Besides nearly three years of mutual aid history, which allowed them to understand the benefits of mutual aid from personal experience, a major reason was the implementation of leadership by poor and hired peasants. Wangjiayuan is managed by poor and hired peasants. The main cadres of each system are poor and hired peasants. The village chief and mutual aid team leader Li Bao, the director of the village union and mutual aid team leader Wang Shuihou, and the 18 cadres below them are all poor or hired peasants. Only the militia committee director Li Hualiang, the agricultural association standing committee member Du Yuwen, and the fourth detachment leader Li Runnian were former middle peasants. Under the leadership of such a vast majority of poor and hired peasant components, everyone's idea of ​​getting rich through production was very clear. They said, "Now the government is telling us to get rich. Our village even won a prize flag because of good production. We couldn't even think about plowing land in the past, and now we can't do a good job of plowing!" In addition, they formed a backbone group composed of poor peasants such as Zhao Linbao, Wang Shuihou, Wang Genhui, Guo Yonglu, Zhao Lianbao, and Wang Sannian, the head of the cattle-plowing group. According to the demands of the masses, a preliminary plan (or opinion) was drawn up for discussion and deliberation among the masses until it matured, and then it was passed at the conference to decide on implementation, all the way to the completion of these plans. Because the poor and hired peasants were in charge, all of this could be achieved. For example, out of 128 households in the village, 13 had no livestock, of which 10 were dependents of military cadres who lacked labor, and the remaining 13 were old middle peasants and poor peasants who were lonely and widowed. If the animal power was not organized, they would not be able to plow. Even some old middle peasants with livestock, under the slackening of thought, were afraid that they would not be able to finish the plowing. In this way, they accurately calculated all the animal power in the village that could participate in autumn plowing and organized 21 plows. According to the 1,630 mu of autumn land in the village, each animal had to plow at least 77 mu, and each animal plowed an average of 3.5 mu per day, which would take 22 days to plow. Therefore, they also studied threshing, milling, and other tasks that did not require livestock, concentrating all efforts on autumn plowing, and making sure to take care of everyone and plow all the autumn land in the village. In the exchange of labor and animal power prices, in order to ensure that neither party suffered, it was stipulated that plowing one mu of land would return two workdays and five sheng of rice, or converted to rice if grass was given. In terms of leadership, the cattle-plowing group leaders of the four detachments were also given important roles to take charge of investigating land, fodder, livestock, and wage matters to solve specific problems in plowing.
    Taking hired and poor peasants as the backbone to insist on organizing, breaking the indifferent thinking of the old middle peasants. When discussing and deliberating on the night of October 15th, the thinking of most middle peasants was, "Whether or not to make a surprise attack, anyway, I have livestock and can finish the plowing." Therefore, they were very indifferent to the surprise attack organization for autumn plowing, while the poor and hired peasants resolutely supported organizing to make a surprise attack on autumn plowing and repeatedly explained that organizing together was better than machines. Under these circumstances, the indifferent thinking of the old middle peasants was broken, and they also agreed that surprise attack autumn plowing was possible, and unanimously passed the plan. At this meeting, the masses were once again tested, and Wang Sannian, the cattle-plowing group leader who had insisted on organizing in the past, was promoted to the general cattle-plowing group leader, and Wang Wunian, the middle-peasant cattle-plowing group leader who performed "not seeking merit but seeking no fault" in his work, was replaced by the poor peasant Wang Youhe.
    The next day (October 16th), Wangjiayuan began plowing, Houjiayuan also started plowing on the 19th, and Majiayuan started plowing on the 24th. During plowing, in addition to the backbone group mainly composed of poor and hired peasants inspecting every day, Wang Sannian, the cattle-plowing group leader of poor and hired peasant origin, urged the livestock to plow the land before dawn every day. Guo Shanchou and two other old middle peasant families usually performed poorly. At this time, he did not want to plow in the group and wanted to go to Chengguan to sell cattle feed, which was both free and could take on some good stubble land to plow. After Wang Sannian persuaded him, Wangjiayuan's 20-day autumn plowing plan was completed in 17 days. Other villages such as Houjiayuan, Majiayuan, and Caojiayuan also completed their work on schedule within 20 days.
    After they finished plowing the autumn land, they immediately organized five head of livestock from middle peasants such as Guo Shuanyin who were willing to sell cattle feed in Chengguan, and organized nine poor and hired peasants to transport and buy used clothes in Jiang County. This not only completed the autumn plowing of the whole village, but also allowed the middle peasants to squeeze out time to sell cattle feed, and allowed the hired and poor peasants to take time out to engage in sideline production. This was due to the good leadership of the poor and hired peasants.

　　王家园怎样在
    贫雇领导下完成秋垡
    赛周
    【本报太岳二十一日电】沁源模范村王家园，全村一千六百三十亩秋地，二十一犋牲口，在十月十六日至十一月六日二十天内，按期完成秋垡，除了他们将近三年的互助历史，能从切身经验中认识互助的好处以外，一个主要原因，是实行了贫雇领导。王家园是贫雇当家的，各系统主要干部都是贫雇，村长兼互助大队长李保、村联合会主任兼互助大队长王水厚等以下十八个干部，都是贫农或雇农，仅仅武委会主任李华亮，农会常委杜原文，四分队长李润年等三人是旧中农，在这样绝大多数的贫雇成份领导之下，大家生产致富的思想非常明确，他们说：“现在政府就是叫咱们发财的，咱村因为生产好，还得过奖旗，过去想垡地也没地垡，现在还能不好好的垡！”此外他们又以赵林保、王水厚、王根惠、郭永禄、赵连保及耕牛组长王三年等贫农成份组成骨干组。又根据群众要求，订出初步计划（或叫意见），在群众中去讨论酝酿，直至酝酿成熟后，再到大会通过，决定执行，一直到完成这些计划，由于贫雇当家，所以都能做到。如全村一百二十八户中，有十三户没牲口，其中有十户是没劳力军干属，其余十三户是孤寡的旧中农及贫农，要是不把畜力组织起来，就犁不了。甚至某些有畜力的旧中农，在思想松懈的情况下，也恐怕垡不完。这样他们就把全村能参加秋垡的畜力精确计算了一下，组织二十一张犁，按全村一千六百三十亩秋地，每犋至少要犁七十七亩，每天每犋牲口平均犁三亩半，二十二天才能犁完。因此又研究打场、碾面等不用牲口，全力集中秋垡，一定要照顾大家，把全村所有秋地统统垡完。在人畜力价格的交换上，为使双方互不吃亏，规定了犁一亩地还工两个，还米是五升，如给草则以米折合。在领导上，又重用了四个分队的耕牛组长，专管调查土地、草料、牲口、要工资等事，以解决犁地中的具体问题。
    以雇贫为骨干坚持组织起来，打破旧中农的冷淡思想。在十月十五日夜间讨论酝酿时，大部分中农的思想是“突击不突击，反正我有牲口能垡完。”因而对秋垡的突击组织十分冷淡，而贫雇则是坚决拥护组织起来突击秋垡，并反复说明组织起来顶机器。在这样的情况下，旧中农的冷淡思想才被打破，也认为突击秋垡可以，就一致通过这一计划。在这个会议上，群众又得到一次考验，把过去的坚持组织起来的耕牛组长王三年升为总耕牛组长，又把在工作中表现“不求有功但求无过”的中农成份耕牛组长王五年撤换，改由贫农王有和担任。
    第二天（十月十六），王家园即开始犁地，侯家园也于十九日开犁，马家园于二十四日开犁。在犁地中，除以贫雇为主的骨干组每天检查外，贫雇成份的耕牛组长王三年，每天是天不明就催牲口垡地。旧中农郭拴酬等两家平素表现不好，这时他又不想在组内犁地，要到城关卖牛晌，又自由，又可以揽些好垡的谷茬地，经王三年说服了，于是王家园二十天的秋垡计划，十七天就完成了。其他侯家园、马家园、曹家园等村也在二十天内按期完成。
    他们垡完秋地后，立即组织了愿意到城关卖牛晌的中农郭拴银等五犋牲口去卖牛晌，又组织了九个贫雇农到绛县运输买估衣，这样既完成了全村的秋垡，中农又能挤出时间去卖牛晌，雇贫也能抽出时间去搞副业生产，这是由于贫雇领导搞的好。
