　　People's Army Needs 精兵, Masses Use Three Tests to Select Good People
　　The People of Zuoquan Shahe Review New Recruits
　　[Report from this newspaper in Zuoquan] The conscription movement in Zuoquan is like a rising tide. Preliminary statistics from the 4th to the 9th show that it has reached 2,300 people. The approach is to first discuss current affairs, think about emancipation, and compare situations, which inspires farmers' confidence in victory and makes them realize that this is their own world, and consciously recognize the importance of joining the army. For example, the masses in Dong'an, Fourth District, said in their discussions of current affairs: "Only by overthrowing Chiang Kai-shek can the world be at peace. If we have been emancipated but the root of disaster is not removed, we will never be at peace." Wang Chengyang, an emancipated farmer in Zihui Village, Second District, said: "We were emancipated and gained our fruits after the Eighth Route Army came. Chiang Kai-shek wants to take them away again. Now we are winning everywhere, and the world has become ours. If we don't fight, who will we rely on?" The masses in various places have raised their awareness in such discussions of current affairs and comparisons of situations. In just four or five days, many models have emerged among the farmers of the county. For example, Song En'yuan in Fenghou saw that his brother had signed up and said, "I will sign up too. Let's go, brothers." Zhuang Ze's Wang Guizhang and his son went to join the army together. There were also grandmothers sending grandsons, parents sending sons, sisters sending brothers, shopkeepers sending employees, etc. In particular, party members and cadres played a leading role in this conscription. In the Fifth District alone, party members accounted for two-thirds of the conscripts, and 170 cadres signed up.
　　Due to increased awareness, this expansion of the army has broken the past bad practices of large amounts of gifts and coercion. The masses are completing this task with a high degree of consciousness. Not only is the quantity exceeded, but the quality is also emphasized. The masses recognize that this is their own army and want elite troops, not people of unclear backgrounds. Various places are universally and repeatedly reviewing new recruits. In Shuipo, a small village, 63 people signed up, but only 18 capable people were left after three reviews. For example, Xiyadi Village in the Fourth District proposed three musts and three must-nots for joining the army. (Shi Min, You Zhi)
　　[Report from this newspaper in Shahe] After the Sixth District held a celebration rally with more than 14,000 people on November 2nd and 3rd to celebrate the counter-offensive, the masses recognized the current situation, and emancipated farmers enthusiastically demanded to join the army to defend their land and property. The district's task was 150 people, but 899 people signed up in two days. The masses in Xicui proposed that our counter-offensive now is like boiling water. We can see that the water is about to boil, but we are short of firewood. If we add another bundle of firewood, the water will boil, and we will win. Zhu Ji, the communist party member who is the director of the Armed Forces Committee, led twelve militiamen to join the army. When Liu Ronggui from Nanwang Village was holding a meeting in a mutual aid group, he signed up and mobilized his son to join the army. As a result, his son also signed up in the militia. After the task was completed, the leaders proposed that the masses strictly inspect the soldiers, the soldiers inspect each other, check their composition, check their ideology, check their history, and check their physical fitness. Various villages are now checking the soldiers. For example, in the Ordinary Store Joint Defense area, 284 people signed up, and 120 were approved by the masses. (Gao Meng, Meng Ling, Guang Xiao)
　　[Another News Item] After the Fourth District Xincheng Joint Defense area mobilized on the 8th, young people signed up one after another. Xu Zhuang, the militia instructor, said: "My nephew joined the army last June. This time I want to go. It is often said that brothers are best for fighting tigers, and fathers and sons are best for fighting in battle. My father and son soldiers are going to capture Chiang Kai-shek." Liu Xuehai from Xincheng said: "I am small, but I am not young. I am eighteen years old. I can play the bugle, and I want to capture Chiang Kai-shek alive!" The number of applicants exceeded the original plan by more than double.

　　人民军队兵要精　群众三验挑好人
    左权沙河群众审查新兵
    【本报左权讯】左权的参军运动，正如潮上涨，四号开始至九号初步统计已达二千三百名。作法上首先是谈时事、想翻身、比光景，启发了农民胜利信心，认识了这是自己天下，自觉认识参军重要。如四区东庵群众在讨论时事中说：“打倒蒋介石，才能安天下，咱们翻了身除不掉祸根，终久是个不安生。”二区紫会村翻身农民王成羊说：“八路军来了才翻了身得了果实，蒋介石又想夺，如今到处胜利，天下已成了咱的哩，咱不打靠谁去？”各地群众都在这样谈时事、比时光中提高了觉悟，短短四五天内，全县农民涌出了好多模范。如丰候宋恩元，见他哥报了名，他说：“我也报，咱弟兄们都去。”庄则王贵章父子三人同去参军。还有翁婆送孙、父母送子、姐送弟、掌柜送伙计等，特别是党员和干部，在这次参军中起了带头作用，只五区一个区，党员参军占三分之二，干部报名一百七十人。
    由于觉悟提高，在这次扩军中，打破了过去大量献礼与强制等不良作风，群众以高度自觉来完成这一任务。不但数量超过，在质量上，同样重视。群众认识是自己部队，要精兵不要不清白人，各地普遍翻复的审查新兵。只水坡一个小村，报名的有六十三人，经过三审，只留十八名精干的。又如四区西崖底村提出参军三要、三不要规定。（世民、有智）
    【本报沙河讯】六区在十一月二三号，召开了全区一万四千多人的庆祝反攻大会后，群众认清当前的形势，翻身农民热烈要求参军，保卫土地和财产。全区任务一百五十名，两天即有八百九十九人报名。西崔群众提出，现在咱们反攻好象烧开水一样，眼看水就烧开，还缺一把柴火，再有一把柴火水就开了，我们就胜利了。武委会主任共产党员朱吉带领十二个民兵参军。南汪村刘荣贵在互助组开会时，他报名动员他小子去参军，结果他小子在民兵中也报了名。完成任务后，领导上又提出群众严格验兵、兵验兵、查成份、查思想、查历史、查体格，现在各村正在查兵中。如普通店联防报名人数二八四名，经群众验上一二○名。（高孟、梦令、光孝）
    【又讯】四区新城联防，八日动员后，青壮纷纷报名。许庄民兵指导员说：“去年六月俺侄儿参了军，这次我要去，常说打虎还是亲弟兄，上阵还是父子兵，俺这父子兵要去捉拿蒋介石。”新城刘雪海说：“我个儿小，年岁可不小，十八岁了，我能吹号，我也要去活捉蒋介石哩！”报名的超过了原计划超过了一倍多。
