　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 28th: Belated news: More than 200 men from the 9th Battalion of Yan bandit's Shanxi Field Army Datong Security General Team, stationed at Kouquan, transported coal to the Yanya mining area southwest of Datong on the 27th of last month. The next morning, they were ambushed by a local armed unit, which killed or wounded more than 60 enemies and captured 35 alive, including six Japanese officers. They are: Yoshidda Akira, captain of the first company, a major, formerly a warrant officer, 30 years old, from Nagoya, now renamed Ji Shijue; Yamashita Isamu, captain of the second company, a lieutenant, formerly a corporal, 29 years old, from Kumamoto Prefecture, now named Zhang Tianshan; Yoda Nobuyuki, chief of the machine gun company, formerly a private first class, 25 years old, from Tokyo, now named Li Ruiting. In addition, Japanese instructors Ono and Aikei were released by the People's Liberation Army due to injuries. According to Yoshida Akira, he worked in the cipher section (i.e., the confidential room) of the Zhangjiakou Mengjiang Expeditionary Army Headquarters before the Japanese surrender. After the Japanese surrender, he went to Datong and was retained by the Yan bandits. Before July of last year, he managed personnel allocation in the Japanese Army Special Service Regiment's adjutant office. After July, the Special Service Regiment was changed to the Security General Team, and he was transferred to the first company of the ninth battalion. There were four Japanese soldiers in the team, all serving as officers or instructors. All the captured war criminals have been escorted to the rear.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin Ji Lu Yu, 28th: Tsuyuki Kiyosaku, a Japanese lieutenant medical officer of the 1st Regiment of the 49th Division of the Yan Army, recently defected to the Liberated Area via Shouyang and Yuci. Tsuyuki originally served in the Japanese Shanxi Expeditionary Army. After being incorporated into the Yan Army, he was renamed Lu Moqing. Tsuyuki's confession has provided ironclad evidence of the Yan bandits' collusion with the Japanese invaders, their collaboration and treachery, their deliberate delay in returning war criminals, and their assistance to the Yan bandits in carrying out civil war and harming the people under the instigation of the US-Chiang clique. It is said that the Yan bandits retained approximately 5,000 Japanese soldiers and civilians, and approximately 7,000 to 8,000 including their families. They were originally organized into nine security battalions, of which seven, eight, and nine battalions were stationed in Datong, and the rest were stationed around Taiyuan and the Zhengtai Line. Around the Zhengtai Campaign in May of this year, the Yan bandits deeply felt the lack of mobile forces, and reorganized the Japanese army security team into a field army, and the battalions were renamed regiments. Excluding the three Datong battalions and the fifth battalion in Yangquan, which was annihilated by our Jin-Cha-Ji Liberation Army in May, there were five regiments, collectively known as the "4173 Unit," equivalent to a division-level organization. The commander was Major General Ueno. The commander of the 1st Regiment was Colonel Oda Ainosuke, the 2nd Regiment was Colonel Inoue, the 3rd Regiment was Colonel Nagatomi, the 4th Regiment was Colonel Yoshiya, and the 6th Regiment was Colonel Nunokawa. Except for a small portion or part of the direct subordinate teams of each regiment being Japanese, the combat troops of the regiment were mostly Japanese soldiers, each with three or four hundred men. Japanese soldiers were all treated as junior officers. In addition, a large number of Japanese served in the Yan bandit's regular army, military training institutions, economic departments, and secret service agencies. Japanese in the Yan army mostly served as instructors or deputy commanders, such as in the 49th Division, in addition to Tsuyuki himself, the division headquarters also had five people including Lieutenant Colonel Tomikichi, staff officer, and Xiongkichi, Kuroiwa, Matsueda Chiro, and Chiba, four instructors. Currently, the Xishan Coal Mine in Taiyuan has a training regiment training Yan army officers, staff officers, combat command, and other businesses, which is responsible for by Lieutenant General Motosumi. There is also a training class for training new recruits in armored units, specializing in training tank and armored car drivers, which is responsible for by Major General Akahoshi. The Northwest Industrial Company of the Yan puppet regime also retained many Japanese technicians and gave them all three-level promotions based on their original rank.
