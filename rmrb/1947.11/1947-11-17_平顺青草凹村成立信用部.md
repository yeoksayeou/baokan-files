　　Pingshun Qingcao'ao Village Establishes Credit Cooperative
    [Our Pingshun News] Qingcao'ao Village in the Third District has established a credit cooperative, preparing to develop sideline occupations. At the beginning, the masses felt that due to drought and poor harvests, they could barely afford to eat, let alone buy shares. They also worried about not being able to use the money freely after investing. Later, after two days of discussion within the mutual aid teams on the 28th and 29th, on the night of the 29th, at the people's school, with poor and hired peasants as the backbone, they recalled the past, exposing how landlords exploited them for money and how they pawned items at pawnshops. For example, Lao Ying Shiyuechang said: "In the past, I borrowed 50 yuan from the landlord Bai Ren, and when I was 23, he took away my furniture!" Zhang Wenbin, a 74-year-old man, said: "In the past, I borrowed money from the landlord Shi Lianfang. When I couldn't pay the interest by the twelfth month, I borrowed five sheng of wheat, had it ground to celebrate the New Year, and on the thirtieth he came and took the wheat away." Shi Zilai said: "In the past, when people borrowed money, others would first see if your property was worth it. If it was worth it, they would lend it to you, otherwise they wouldn't." After introducing the situation of how the Huangshan Credit Cooperative in Huguan organized everyone to produce and gain profits, a discussion was launched. Everyone realized that the credit cooperative was not just for collecting shares, but for labor-capital cooperation in production, where everyone who invested shares would earn profits and share them. This cleared the masses' minds. Under the influence of the political director Shi Huaixin, who took the lead in investing 10,000 yuan, within one night, the shares reached 282,000 yuan, six jin of cotton, and one hundred and ten jin of wheat. It was also stipulated that the interest rate would be 2.5 to 3 fen per yuan per day. With the help of a bank loan of 150,000 yuan and the cooperative investing 100,000 yuan, the credit cooperative was immediately established and has now started operating. (Ben Zhong, Zhensheng)

　　平顺青草凹村成立信用部
    【本报平顺讯】三区青草凹村成立信用部，准备开展副业。开始提出时，群众觉得天旱歉收，还顾不住吃，那有钱入股，及入进去自己使用不随便啦等思想，后经二十八、二十九在互助组酝酿了两天，二十九日夜在民校以贫雇为骨干回忆过去揭地主钱，到当铺当押东西，怎样受剥削，如劳英史悦昌说：“我过去揭地主白仁钱五十元，年二十三时把家具抬走！”七十四岁的老汉张文斌说：“我过去揭地主史联芳钱，腊月上不上利钱，咱去借了五升麦子叫磨下来过年，三十日来把麦子拿走了。”史子来说：“过去揭钱人家先看看你的财产值不值，值才放给，不值就不放给啦。”又把壶关黄山信用社组织大家生产得利的情形介绍后，展开讨论，都认识了信用社不是为集股，而是劳资合作生产，大家分集股大家赚利，大家分，这样打通了群众思想，在政治主任史怀信首起带头入股一万元的影响下，一夜时间入股即达二十八万二千元，棉花六斤，麦子一百一十斤，并规定出利息，每日每元二分五至三分，并有银行帮助贷十五万元，合作社入股十万元，立即成立起了信用部，现已开始营业。（本中、振声）
