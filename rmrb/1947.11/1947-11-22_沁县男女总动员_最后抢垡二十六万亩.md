　　[This newspaper Taiyue dispatch on the 20th] Qinxian mobilized men and women to make a final rush to plow 260,000 mu. Of the county's 360,000 mu, 100,000 mu have already been plowed. Although the weather has gradually turned cold recently, and the ground is about to freeze, the county insists on plowing the land once universally. Therefore, in addition to organizing the county's 3,000 head of livestock to plow, more than 70,000 men and women, both full and part-time laborers, have been organized and thrown into the rush to plow. In each village, apart from the old, weak, and disabled, all others are closing their doors and going to the fields. Many mothers bring their babies to the fields to sleep and nurse in order to participate in plowing. Under the overall mobilization of men, women, old and young in Changxing Village, 80% of the land has been plowed five days ago, preparing to complete the task ahead of schedule and support other villages. Therefore, merchants and residents of towns and schools also participated in the rush to plow movement. The whole town plowed 230 mu of land in one day. Women in Nanli Village organized themselves to plow the land and compete with men, becoming the main force in the autumn plowing movement. For example, Li Xiufeng's group, composed of fifteen women pulling a plow, plowed more than five mu of land in one day. Cui San's women's mutual aid group got up before dawn to dig up the stubble, and finished digging three and a half mu before daylight, influencing the 29 mutual aid groups in the village to actively rush to plow from early morning to late at night. In seven days, they plowed 965 mu, accounting for three-quarters of the village's autumn land. The remaining 357 mu are planned to be completed within four days. Daixian Village organized a men's and women's human-powered plowing mutual aid group of 83 people, which can plow 52.5 mu per day. The reason why the autumn plowing movement can be universally launched throughout the county is that party, government, and people's cadres at all levels personally participate in the leadership. The secretary of the First District Committee and the standing committee member of the Women's Salvation Association personally participated in human-powered plowing, leading the masses to plow the land. The secretary of the Fourth District Committee, after discovering that Kaicun Group had organized human-powered plowing, immediately led cadres from several villages to visit, promoting the universal organization of human-powered plowing in the whole district, overcoming the difficulties of animal power. In addition, the village cadres in each village recognized the importance of autumn plowing and actively led the masses to rush to plow day and night. For example, the village head and the director of the Armed Forces Committee of Jiaokou Village, and the secretary of the Women's Salvation Association, led the masses to dig up stubble by moonlight and plow the land during the day.
　　[This newspaper Taiyue dispatch on the 20th] Gao Yunting from Yuan Village, Tunliu, organized forces to help poor tenants finish plowing their land. On the 11th, Gao Yunting went deep into various base points to inspect, and found that a large part of the land of the poor tenants in Luojiagou had not been plowed. The Guicheng group had six households, planting 114 mu of land, without a single animal. Although six people dug the land every day before dawn after the autumn harvest, they could only dig five mu per day. At most, they could dig 70 or 80 mu before the ground froze. In addition, one person had recently left to join the war. Others, such as Huo Fengrui, Luo Changli, and Luo Yuanlei, although they had cattle, were either small or sick, and there was no way to finish plowing. Gao Yunting immediately held a meeting with the cadres of each base point to discuss, and unanimously agreed to help the poor tenants complete the autumn plowing and never let an mu of land go unplowed. The next day, the first production base point helped 44 people, the third base point helped with one animal. The base point personally led by Gao Yunting, participated with nine men and fourteen women, to help the poor tenants rush to plow in autumn. Therefore, the original plan to plow 36 qing of autumn land by the 19th has now been completed on the 16th ahead of schedule.

　　沁县男女总动员
  　最后抢垡二十六万亩
    【本报太岳二十日电】沁县男女总动员最后抢垡二十六万亩。全县三十六万亩，已垡十万亩，近来虽天气渐冷，地将冻结，但该县坚持普遍垡地一遍，所以除将全县三千头牲口组织起犁地外，并将七万余男女全半劳力组织起来，卷入抢垡，各村除老弱残废外，均关门上地，许多母亲为参加垡地，将婴儿带至地里睡觉哺乳，长兴村在男女老幼全体出动之下，五日前已垡地百分之八十，准备提前完成，支援别村。故县镇商民与学校亦参加抢垡运动，全镇一天便垡地二百三十亩。南里村妇女组织起来垡地，与男人竞赛，成为秋垡运动中的主力，如李秀峰组，十五个妇女组成人拉犁，一天即垡地五亩多，崔三妇女互助组，天不亮就起来刨茬，赶天明即刨完三亩半，影响了全村廿九个互助组都积极起早搭黑的抢垡，七天便垡了九百六十五亩，占全村秋地的四分之三，其余的三百五十七亩，计划在四天内完成。待贤村组织了男女八十三的人拉犁互助组，每天能犁五十二亩五分。全县抢垡运动所以能普遍展开的原因，是党政民各级干部亲自参加领导之故，一区分委书记与妇救会常委都亲身参加人拉犁，带领群众垡地，四区分委书记发现开村组组人拉犁后，马上带领数村干部前往参观，推动了全区普遍组织人拉犁，克服了畜力的困难。此外，各村村干部认识了秋垡的重要，也积极领导群众日夜赶垡，如交口村村长及武委会主任，妇救会秘书，带领群众月夜刨茬白天犁地。
    【本报太岳二十日电】屯留原村高云亭，组织力量帮助雇贫垡完地。高云亭于十一日深入各基点检查，发现罗家沟雇贫尚有大部地未垡，贵成小组六户，种地一百一十四亩，没有一个牲口，虽然秋收后六个人每日天将明就刨地，每天只能刨五亩，到上冻时顶多刨七、八十亩，又加上最近又有一个人出外参战，其他如霍逢瑞、罗长礼、罗元垒虽有牛，不是小就是病，亦没办法垡完。高云亭即和各基点干部开会讨论，一致意见要帮助雇贫完成秋垡，绝不空过一亩地。第二天，第一生产基点帮助四十四人，第三基点帮助一犋牲口，高云亭亲自领导的基点，参加九个男人、十四个女人，帮助雇贫突击秋垡，因此，原计划三十六顷秋地十九日垡完，现提前于十六日已全部垡完。
