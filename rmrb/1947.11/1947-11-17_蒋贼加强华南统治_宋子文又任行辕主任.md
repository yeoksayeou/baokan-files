　　Chiang Bandit Strengthens Rule in South China
　　Soong Tzu-wen Appointed Director of the Xing Yuan Again
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th】 After the American running dog Soong Tzu-wen became the chairman of the Chiang bandit's Guangdong Provincial Government for a month and a half, he was also appointed as the director of the Chiang bandit's South China (Guangzhou) Xing Yuan. The Chiang bandit government issued this order on the 14th. At the same time, Huang Zhenqiu, the former Deputy Chief of Staff of the Chiang bandit's Ministry of National Defense, was appointed as the deputy director. The original director of the Guangzhou Xing Yuan, Zhang Fakui, and the deputy director, Xu Jing Tang (both Cantonese generals), were both pushed off the stage. According to Tianjin Yishibao, Soong Tzu-wen is planning to establish a "special economic system" in South China to facilitate the dumping of American goods, in order to adapt to the interests of American imperialism. Many importers in Shanghai have set up offices in Hong Kong, and a large amount of floating capital is flowing south.

  　宋子文又任行辕主任
    【新华社陕北十五日电】美国走狗宋子文出任蒋匪广东省府主席一个半月之后，又受任为蒋贼华南（广州）行辕主任，蒋匪政府已于十四日颁布此项命令，同时原任蒋匪国防部参谋次长黄镇球则被任为副主任。原广州行辕主任张发奎及副主任徐景唐（皆粤系将领）皆被推下台。另据天津益世报消息，宋子文为适应美帝国主义利益正谋在华南建立一“特殊之经济体系”，以便利美货之倾销，上海许多进口商已纷纷在港设立办事处，游资大量南流。
