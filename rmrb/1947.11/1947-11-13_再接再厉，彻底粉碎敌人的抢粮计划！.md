　　Keep Up the Efforts, Thoroughly Smash the Enemy's Grain-Grabbing Plan!
    Today's newspaper reports the news of the enemies besieged in "isolated islands" on the edge of our area launching large-scale grain grabs, which should arouse high vigilance in all regions. This shows that the enemies struggling on the verge of death, in order to prolong their lives, will definitely be more frantic and more brutal in grabbing grain this autumn than in previous years. As the saying goes, "A cornered dog will jump over a wall." If we relax even slightly, we will suffer a great loss. The facts of Zhuoshui and other villages in Hui County tell us that any paralysis and negligence in the grain protection struggle will suffer undue losses.
    We hope that all regions will urgently mobilize, keep up the efforts, and thoroughly smash the enemy's grain-grabbing plan. First, local armed forces, work teams, and militias should cooperate closely in planned operations, combining rifles and mines, going deep behind enemy lines, attacking and annihilating the enemy, and striking at the enemy's grain-grabbing arrogance. Second, mobilize the masses in the border areas to inspect preparations for war and store grain, improve the intelligence network and joint defense line, and carry out mass grain protection movements. Facts have proven that as long as we are prepared and fight bravely, we will surely achieve victory!

　　再接再厉，彻底粉碎敌人的抢粮计划！
    今天报载我区边沿困守“孤岛”的敌人向我大举抢粮的新闻，值得引起各地高度的警惕。这说明临死挣扎的敌人，为了苟延残喘，今秋抢粮定必较往年更要疯狂，更要残暴，俗话说：“狗急了跳墙”，我们稍一松懈，就要吃大亏，辉县卓水等村的事实，告诉我们对护粮斗争存在任何麻痹与疏忽都会遭受不应有的损失。
    我们希望各地都紧急动员起来，再接再厉，彻底粉碎敌人的抢粮计划，第一、各地方武装、武工队、民兵要有计划的密切配合作战，雷枪结合，深入敌后，袭敌歼敌，打击敌人的抢粮凶焰；第二、把边沿群众都动员起来，检查备战藏粮，健全情报网联防线，开展群众性的护粮运动。事实证明：只要我们有准备并勇敢的作战，我们就一定能取得胜利！
