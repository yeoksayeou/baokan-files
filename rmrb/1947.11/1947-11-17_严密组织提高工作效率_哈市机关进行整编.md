Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 8th: Harbin city organs are enthusiastically carrying out a reorganization movement, holding democratic meetings and establishing reorganization committees to conduct in-depth reviews. On October 28th, Li Fuchun, of the CCP Northeast Bureau, conveyed the Northeast Bureau's decision on the reorganization of rear organs at a cadre meeting, explaining that the purpose of the reorganization is to tighten organization, unify staffing, improve systems, increase work efficiency, strengthen the concept of war and the mass viewpoint, and exert all efforts to adapt to and support the increasingly developing large-scale war needs. Currently, various organs in the city are deploying work according to their specific circumstances. The Northeast Administrative Committee has determined to reduce the number of personnel, formulate living and working systems, universally strengthen learning, conduct criticism and self-criticism, and clean up household affairs. The General Political Department of the Democratic Allied Army has proposed a draft plan to reorganize one-quarter of the personnel.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 11th: The reorganization movement of rear organs in Harbin City has achieved significant results. Various units directly under the headquarters of the Democratic Allied Army have conducted democratic meetings and group meetings among cadres, soldiers, and support staff. They have now preliminarily determined to unify staffing and formulate various systems. After the reorganization, manpower savings amount to approximately 140 people, a reduction of twelve cars of various sizes, and a general reduction of guards and communication personnel by more than one-half. Dormitory lights and telephones have also been significantly reduced. In terms of systems, a fixed-time work and reception system has been implemented, separating work from personal daily affairs and correcting the phenomenon of leaving work posts at any time. This reorganization meeting made a mass assessment of the thinking and leadership style of each cadre, and the relationship between superiors and subordinates and among each other became closer after the meeting. The responsible leader of the Northeast Railway Protection Army Command automatically reduced guards, and various departments reduced internal communication personnel and other personnel, reducing personnel by one-third, saving 12 million yuan annually. After this reorganization, work efficiency has doubled. The Transportation Department of the Logistics Department reduced support staff by two-thirds, and many cadres and their families handled their daily household affairs themselves. All cadres and soldiers wrote letters of determination, formulated work plans and improved work style, and announced and discussed them one by one at democratic meetings. Communication personnel, cooks, feeders, etc., also proposed participating in night哨 to reduce the guard force. District governments, public security bureaus, and production departments in Harbin City are carrying out reorganization in connection with class investigation and ideological investigation.

  　哈市机关进行整编
    【新华社东北八日电】哈尔滨市各机关正热烈进行整编运动，纷纷召开民主大会，成立整编委员会，展开深入检讨。上月二十八日，首由中共东北局李富春同志在干部大会上传达东北局关于后方机关整编的决定，说明整编目的在于严密组织，统一编制，健全制度，提高工作效率，加强战争观念与群众观点，发挥一切力量，以适应与支持日益发展的大规模战争的需要。现该市各机关根据具体情况，布置工作。东北行政委员会确定降低编制人数，拟订生活与工作制度，普遍加强学习，进行批评与自我批评，清理家务。民主联军总政治部提出整编四分之一人员的草案。
    【新华社东北十一日电】哈尔滨市后方机关整编运动，已获不少成绩。民主联军总部直属各单位在干部战士及勤杂人员中，普遍进行了民主大会及小组会，现已初步确定统一编制，拟定各种制度。整编后节省人力约一百四十余人，减去大小汽车十二辆，警卫员及通讯员普遍减少二分之一以上，宿舍电灯电话亦大量缩减。在制度方面，实行定时工作与定时接待制，使工作与个人日常事务分开，纠正随时离开工作岗位的现象。此次整编会议对每个干部的思想与领导作风都作了一个群众性的鉴定，会后上下级与相互间的关系愈益密切。东北铁路护路军司令部负责首长自动减去警卫员，各科减少内勤通讯员及其他人员，共减去人员三分之一，每年节省经费一千二百万元。经此整编后，工作效能反而倍增。后勤部运输处裁减勤杂人员三分之二，许多干部及家属均自己处理日常家务，全部干部及战士纷纷写决心书制定工作计划与改进工作作风，在民主大会上逐一宣布与讨论。通讯员、炊事员、饲养员等也提出夜间参加放哨，以减少守卫部队。哈市各区政府、公安局及生产部门，与查阶级、查思想相联系进行整编。
