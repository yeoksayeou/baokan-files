　　How to Do a Good Job in Stretcher Work
    Ji'nan Branch
    From September 8th to October 14th, Ji'nan provided 5,000 stretchers, involving approximately 40,000 people. Based on the experience of the East China Field Army's offensive on the Longhai Railway, it is felt that to support the patriotic self-defense war in the long term, it is necessary to further improve stretcher work to make it more adaptable to the war environment and save civilian manpower. The following issues are raised for reference:
    The use of civilian manpower for stretchers is the greatest, and it is also the issue that is most closely related to the interests of the masses. To do this work well, the main thing is to grasp two basic links: one is strict organizational work, and the other is political management.
        　　I. Strict and Lean Organization
    This time, the stretcher organization was large and extravagant, with phenomena of hiring and drawing lots. Both long and short distances were counted as one trip, and the assignment of labor was extremely unreasonable. In Wucheng, 550 stretchers involved more than 5,000 people (including cadres and militia), averaging more than nine people per stretcher, wasting about 1,000 man-hours. In Macun, Xin County, four districts had three people hired, each receiving 60,000 yuan. Such phenomena should be corrected.
    Strict organizational work, especially at the village level, should focus on reasonable assignment of labor, work point calculation, and accounting, striving to reduce the number of people who do not contribute labor. Those who are hired should not be counted as working, and they must make up for it next time. If those who are hired are poor peasants, their labor should be counted for themselves. For middle peasants who hire, a portion of the money or goods used can be returned to the hirer. If, due to illness or other reasons, they really cannot contribute labor, they can do so next time with the consent of village cadres and the masses. Contributing labor is the duty of every young adult, and the phenomenon of hiring should be prohibited.
    The stretcher team organization should be lean. The personnel in the headquarters of the brigade, company, and platoon should be minimized. Village cadres and sub-district cadres should also participate in carrying stretchers (except for those who cannot spare the time due to their work). Any cadre leading the stretcher team is not allowed to ride livestock. County and district cadres should assist the masses in carrying.
            II. Political Management
    (1) Ideological Leadership
    First of all, we should understand and grasp the changes in the ideological emotions of the masses and conduct ideological leadership. Although the masses have a high enthusiasm for supporting the front, inexperienced masses have many concerns: fear of freezing, fear of hunger, fear of long hours, fear that no one will carry water for the family, fear that the land will not be well cultivated, fear of fatigue, etc. We should seize the time to educate them. The laborers themselves also have practical difficulties, which need to be resolved in a timely manner. The leadership should be responsible to the masses and educate them before and after the assembly, "Why are we providing stretchers?" "For whom are we working?" "How can we complete the task?" When arriving at the front or completing one or two tasks and resting, we should carry out the "People Love People Movement," "Cherish the Wounded and Sick Movement," and "Merit and Model Movement." These movements inspire the masses' consciousness. First of all, we must fully mobilize and deliberate. For example, when carrying out the "People Love People Movement," we should first discuss what the "People Love People Movement" is and why we are carrying out this movement, and then encourage everyone to put forward powerful slogans and conditions. Such as the four "no go's": "No leaving until the water tank is full, no leaving until the yard is swept, no leaving until borrowed items are returned, no leaving until damages are compensated." Help the masses with all production, participate in all labor, respect local customs, and do not harm the interests of the masses. When carrying out the "Cherish the Wounded and Sick Movement," we should also put forward some powerful educational slogans. Such as "To turn over, we must turn over our hearts, and we must care for the wounded." "No drinking, no smoking, save money to buy eggs, and comfort the wounded and sick." "Lift gently, put down slowly, uphill and downhill, head up." When carrying out the "Merit and Model Movement," we should put forward "Everyone makes meritorious contributions, and victory is guaranteed," "It is especially glorious to make meritorious contributions at the front," and "Merit comes from courage and labor comes from hardship." Different slogans are put forward for different objects. To cadres, say: "Cadres are the backbone, and they must take the lead in making meritorious contributions." To heroes and models, say: "Don't be arrogant with credit, and add credit to credit." After careful deliberation and the masses' emotions have risen, seize the opportunity to carry out competition and challenges, and launch mutual oaths. In this way, slogans become mass competition indicators and become the masses' covenants, and the merit movement has a mass base. Finally, we must seriously conduct awards, democratically elect reporters of meritorious deeds, merit recording committees, merit evaluation committees, establish merit books, merit lists, award flags, award certificates, etc. In particular, we must promptly commend specific individuals and make merit and models a regular leadership method.
    (2) Discipline
    Deserters must be punished and made to provide stretchers next time. Launch an anti-"straw chicken feather" movement in the village peasant associations and stretcher teams. Those who organize desertion and sabotage war support work will be sent to the government for legal action. Those who harm the interests of the masses and beat and scold the masses will be subjected to struggle and education in the stretcher laborers, helped to change, and admit their mistakes to the local masses.
    (3) Take good care of the stretcher laborers' lives and practice strict economy.
    According to the report of Yongzhi Wu Committee Director: The county's 150 stretchers passed through two major market towns in Xin County, buying up all the retail food. Few people took only two or three thousand yuan, many took seven or eight thousand yuan, and some took as much as thirty or fifty thousand yuan. Why spend so much money? One of the reasons is that the leadership did not take good care of their lives. In addition, their own waste is also the main reason. The so-called "poor families travel rich," "when should you spend money if not when you go out," and "money should be used where it is difficult." Some people buy a stone of sorghum for each trip. The leadership must take good care of their lives, so that they are not hungry and thirsty, and carry out anti-waste education, and economy is listed as one of the model conditions. We must create effective methods to overcome this phenomenon and greatly reduce spending.

### 怎样做好担架工作

　　怎样做好担架工作
    冀南分社
    九月八号至十月十四号，冀南出担架五千付，共约四万人。此次华东野战军出击陇海路的经验，感到为长期支援爱国自卫战争，必须进一步改善担架工作，使之更适应战争环境，节省民力。特提出以下几个问题以供参考：
    担架使用民力最大，也是关系群众利益最大的问题。要作好这一工作，主要应掌握两个基本环节：一个是严密组织工作，一个是政治管理。
        　　一、严密精干组织
    此次担架组织庞大铺张，有雇觅与抓阄现象。远近长短都算一趟差，支差极不合理。武城五百五十付担架，共五千余人（干部民兵在内），合每付担架九个人还多，约浪费人力千余。莘县四区马村有三个被雇觅者，每人六万元。诸如此类现象应予纠正。
    严密组织工作，特别要注意村级组织，实行合理支差计工算帐，力求减少不支差人数，雇觅者不算出工，下次一定补。被雇觅者如是贫苦农民，要计成其本人的工。中农雇觅者，可酌将使的钱或物退回雇觅者一部分。如因有病或其他原因，实不能出差，经村干群众同意，可下次出。出差是每个青壮年的义务，应禁止雇庸现象。
    担架队组织要精干。大队、中队、分队各队部的人员应尽量少。村干、小区干部亦应参加担架（因工作实不能分身者可例外）。带担架之任何干部，不准骑牲口。县区干部要协助群众抬。
            二、政治管理
    （一）思想领导
    首应了解、掌握群众的思想情绪变化，进行思想领导。虽然群众支前热情很高，但没有经验的群众，顾虑非常多：怕受冻，怕受饿，怕时间长，怕家人吃水无人挑，怕土地种不好，怕累等，应抓紧时间进行教育。民工本身也有实际困难，也须要及时解决。领导上对群众要负责任，在集合前后教育群众“为什么出担架”？“为谁干”？“怎样就可以完成任务”？达到前方或完成一次或二次任务休整时，要开展“民爱民运动”、“爱护彩病号运动”、“立功表模运动”。这些运动启发群众自觉。首先要充分的动员、酝酿。比如开展“民爱民运动”，先将什么是“民爱民运动”，为什么开展这一运动讨论好，再鼓励大家提出有力的口号和条件。如四不走，“水缸不满不走，院子不扫不走，借物不还不走，损坏不赔不走。”帮助群众进行一切生产，参加一切劳动，尊重当地群众风俗习惯，不损害群众利益。开展“爱护彩病号运动”时，也要提出些有力的教育口号。如“翻身要翻心，照顾伤员要关心”，“不喝酒不吸烟，省下钱买鸡蛋，慰劳伤病员。”“轻轻起，慢慢放，上下坡，头朝上。”开展“立功表模运动”时，就提出“人人都立功，胜利有保证”，“前方立功格外光荣”，“功从勇中来，劳从苦中生。”对不同对象提出不同口号。对干部说：“干部是骨干，立功要当先。”对英雄模范说：“有了功劳不骄傲，功劳上边加功劳。”在酝酿成熟，群众情绪已经起来之后，就抓紧时机，进行竞赛挑战，发动互相宣誓。这样一来，口号就变成了群众竞赛指标，成了群众的公约，立功运动就有了群众基础。再次要认真进行评奖，民主选举报功员、记功委员会、评功委员会，建立功劳簿，立功榜，奖旗奖状，……特别要及时表扬具体人物，把立功表模成为经常的领导方法。
    （二）纪律
    逃亡者要处分，下次一定让他出担架。在村农会里、担架队中开展反“草鸡毛”运动。组织逃亡破坏战勤工作者，送政府法办。损害群众利益，打骂群众者，在担架民工中开展斗争，进行教育，帮助转变，向当地群众承认错误。
    （三）好好照顾担架民工生活，厉行节约。
    据永智武委会主任汇报：该县一百五十付担架，路经莘县两大集镇，将零卖食物买吃一空。每人拿两三千元为少数，七、八千元者很多，最多有拿三、五万元者。为什么花这多钱呢？领导上对他们生活照顾不好是原因之一。另外其本人浪费也是主要原因。所谓“穷家富路”、“有钱出门不花何时花”、“钱要用到难处”。有出一次差籴一石高粱者。领导上对他们的生活要照顾好，使他们不挨饿忍渴，进行反浪费教育，节约列为模范条件之一。要创造有效办法，克服此种现象，使其大大减少花钱。
