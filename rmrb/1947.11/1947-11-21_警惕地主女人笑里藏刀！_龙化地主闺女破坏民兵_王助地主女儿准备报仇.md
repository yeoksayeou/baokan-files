　　Landlord's Daughter in Longhua Sabotages Militia
    Landlord's Daughter in Wangzhu Prepares Revenge

[This Newspaper Report] During the thought offering in Puyang's Second District, the landlords' conspiracies were exposed, raising class consciousness. Guo Jude, the Farmers' Association Director of Wangzhu Village, said: "When the land reform started, I married a landlord's daughter. Her family was from Mazhai Village, Fifth District, Gaoling County. Her father was a returned member of the local army and has now fled again. Her mother was purged by the masses. After marrying her, she was unhappy all day, scolding the Farmers' Association and the Women's Association. One night, I had two pistol bullets lying on the table, and she felt them, looked at them, and said, 'These are no match for my two bullets!' I carefully asked her, 'Where did you get those two bullets? Give them to me to use.' At first, she wouldn't give them, but after persuasion, she said, 'My two bullets are for avenging my mother.' Then I thought, if she has bullets, wouldn't she have a gun? Using many methods, showing her my wholeheartedness, she took out a pistol. With this evidence in hand, I thought, this is no way to live. So, I discussed it with the village cadres and the masses, and everyone agreed to divorce her."

[This Newspaper Report] In Longhua Village, Xingtai, twenty-three landlords who had not been thoroughly struggled against used honey traps to carry out sabotage activities, planning to have their ten eldest daughters specifically marry our cadres and militia members. At the time, the government, to prevent the landlords' conspiracy, did not approve of them marrying landlord women. The landlords then took the opportunity to provoke the militia against the government. Zhang Shiyi, the landlord's daughter, said, "Does becoming a militia member mean you have to be a bachelor? Does joining the militia mean you have no freedom?" Militia member Fan Hongyu was provoked into leaving the militia and marrying the landlord's daughter. Later, seven or eight young militia members wanted to lay down their weapons and marry the landlord's daughters. This finally attracted the attention of the leadership. After in-depth visits to poor peasants and hired laborers, it was discovered that the poor people had not turned over because of the landlords' conspiracy and sabotage, and the cadres and militia members had fallen for the honey trap. The director of the Armed Committee, Guo Xiumin, who colluded with the landlords, was immediately dismissed and expelled from the militia. The misled militia members were educated. After reorganizing with poor peasants and active militia members as the backbone, everyone recognized the landlords' counter-offensive conspiracy and proposed that in the future, they must truly separate from the landlords in their hearts and thoroughly struggle against them.

    【本报讯】濮阳二区日前在献思想中揭露了地主阴谋，提高了阶级觉悟。王助村农会主任郭聚德说：“土改开始时我娶了个地主家的女人，她娘家是高陵县五区马砦村人，她爹是还乡队，这次又跑了，她娘被群众清算了。娶了他后，整天她不高兴，骂农会妇会。有一天夜里我有两粒手枪子弹在桌子上放着，她摸摸看看说：“这还不胜我那两粒子弹呢！”我留意问他：“你从那里弄两粒子弹哪？拿出给我用吧。”开始她不拿，经动员后她才说：“我那两粒子弹是要给俺娘报仇用的。”这样我想着有子弹能没有枪么？又用很多办法，向她表示很一心，她又将底把枪一支拿出来给我。这样我拿住了证据，想想这是不能过成时光的。就给俺村干部群众讨论，大家都同意给她离婚了。”
    【本报讯】邢台龙化村二十三户未斗透的地主，以美人计进行破坏活动，有计划的让他们十个大闺女专找我干部民兵结婚，政府当时为防止地主阴谋，不批准他们与地主女人结婚，地主即乘机挑拨民兵反对政府。地主张士义闺女说：“难道当了民兵就得当光棍吗？参加了民兵就没自由。”民兵范宏玉被挑拨的退出民兵和地主闺女结了婚，以后有七八个青年民兵都要放下武器给地主女儿结婚，这一下才引起领导上注意，深入贫雇访问，才发现穷人没翻身，主要是地主阴谋破坏，干部民兵中了美人计，当即罢免与地主勾结的武委会主任郭修敏，并开除民兵籍，教育被迷惑的民兵，以贫雇积极民兵为骨干重新整顿后，大家认识了地主的反攻阴谋，提出今后要从心里真正与地主分家，彻底斗透。（一分武通讯小组）
