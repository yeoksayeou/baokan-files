　　Pingding No. 1 High School and No. 3 High School Emphasize Studying Current Events
    [Report from this newspaper, Pingding] The entire faculty, students, and staff of Pingding No. 1 High School, due to the rapid changes in the domestic and international situation, and because the students did not regularly read newspapers at home during the autumn vacation, the school organized ten reading groups after the start of the semester to study current events to facilitate propaganda. Starting from November 4th, each group studies for two hours every morning. They discuss, study, and analyze unclear current events issues, and each person takes notes on the main points. Now the enthusiasm for learning is very high throughout the school, and there is a further understanding of current events. (Fu Zhen, Ji Wu)
    [Another report] No. 3 High School paid attention to current events propaganda during the autumn vacation. Specific arrangements were made for propaganda work and current events materials during the vacation, such as the victory news after the southward advance of the Liu-Deng army. Each student carried out specific propaganda after returning to their villages. For example, the nine members of the Wang Qu Wang Qunyan group immediately joined the mutual aid group after returning, publicizing victory, composing clapper talks, writing blackboards, etc., which greatly promoted production.

　　平定一高三高注意学习时事
    【本报平定讯】平定一高全体师生及杂务人员，因国内外形势变化很快，又因同学们在秋假期内在家没经常阅读报纸，开学后，全校组织了十个读报小组，来研究时事，便于宣传。从十一月四日起，每天早上按小组学习二小时。对不明白的时事问题提出讨论研究分析，每人择要记出笔记，现在全校师生学习情绪非常高涨，对时事有进一步了解。（甫珍、纪武）
    【又讯】三高在秋假中，注意时事宣传。放假时即具体布置了宣传工作和时事材料，如刘邓大军南下后的胜利消息等。各个学生回村后，具体进行宣传。如王曲王群彦小组九人回去即参加到互助组，宣传胜利、编快板、写黑板报等，对生产有很大推动。
