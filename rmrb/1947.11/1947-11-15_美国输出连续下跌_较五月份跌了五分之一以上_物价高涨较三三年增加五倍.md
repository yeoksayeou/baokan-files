　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th: According to the U.S. News Service, Washington, the total value of U.S. exports in September was $1,114.5 million, a drop of 3% from August (1,139 million), the lowest export month since October of last year, and a sharp drop of 21.7% from May (1,422 million), the peak month for exports this year. The total value of U.S. exports has been declining continuously since June, after the outbreak of the world's gold standard crisis and the restrictions on purchases of American goods by Britain, France, and other countries due to the economic crisis. Calculating from the base of May, exports fell by 13% in June, 19% in July, and 20% in August. September marks the fourth consecutive month of decline.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: New York dispatch: Prices in the United States continue to soar. Since the 16th of last month, there has been an eight-day continuous rise. The wholesale price index of 33 basic commodities in the industrial, agricultural, textile, and non-ferrous metal industries has reached 200.67% (with 1936 as 100%), an increase of two times compared to 1937 (with 1937 at 98.14%), and an increase of almost five times compared to 1933 (with the lowest index in 1933 at 41.44). The Associated Press called it "the greatest surge in history."
