　　High Yields from Superior Varieties
  　One Mu of Jin Huanghou Outperforms Two Mu of Local Corn
    811 Millet Yields Five More Dou Per Mu
    [Report from Changzhi City by this newspaper] This spring, when cadres in the Southwest Guan area mobilized people to plant Jin Huanghou corn, many were unwilling, believing it didn't taste good, produced less flour, and required more fertilizer and labor. First, the cadres took the lead in planting it. As a result, the whole village reluctantly planted 96 mu, and those who were unconvinced didn't plant it. This autumn, the harvested Jin Huanghou corn was praised by everyone. Zhang Fu reaped four cartloads (each cart holding two shi five dou) from his 1.8 mu plot, which could yield ten shi. Wang Erhou weighed a large cob and found that it weighed one jin ten liang. Seven cobs of local corn weighed the same. Guan Fusuo, the chairman of the farmers' association, harvested seven sheng from ten cobs of Jin Huanghou. Six people ate noodles made from it, and there were still two large bowls left over. Fusuo's mother happily told the worker: "Jin Huanghou is good for making noodles, soft and delicious, and it saves elm bark! If I had known earlier, I would have planted it all with Jin Huanghou." Guiwang's wife said: "Jin Huanghou noodles are just great, soft and smooth like cooked rice, the more you eat, the more you want to eat." This year, Song Zhonghai planted three mu of good riverside land with local corn and only hauled back a little over two cartloads. More than one mu of poor land planted with Jin Huanghou yielded twelve dan (each dan three and a half dou). Zhonghai was afraid of the thick skin and didn't dare to plant more. Seeing that Jin Huanghou yielded more, he regretted it very much. His wife scolded him: "Who told you not to plant it all with Jin Huanghou!" Hu Yanzhe's group of seven households only planted a little over one mu, and they all regretted it, saying: "If you don't listen to the government's call, see how much you suffer! We missed out this year, but next year we will all plant Jin Huanghou." People from other villages passing by were envious and said: "Jin Huanghou is really good, next year we will come to exchange seeds." The 96 mu of Jin Huanghou in the whole village yielded a maximum of four shi five dou (market dou) per mu, and an average of three shi per mu, for a total harvest of over 300 shi. The technical committee collected 15 shi of seeds, which are collectively stored in the seed warehouse, ready to be distributed to other areas. The 300 mu of local corn in the whole village yielded an average of only one shi three dou per mu. In such a comparison, the whole village plans to plant all Jin Huanghou next year and eliminate local corn. This year, Northwest Street planted a total of 41 mu of 811 millet, applying 30 dan of fertilizer per mu and hoeing three times. It was all sown with two-legged drills, with a spacing of five to seven inches. As a result, the most vigorous plants had thirteen branches and thirteen ears of grain. Generally, there were only five or six branches. Production Director Li Migou paid attention to technique, and two mu of land yielded six market shi. The 41 mu of 811 millet planted in the whole street averaged two shi four dou per mu, which was five dou more than the average yield of local millet. To promote it to other areas, ten shi of good seeds were collected. The masses responded to 811 millet by saying: "811 saves labor, yields more, and is not afraid of birds eating it." Migou's family milled two dou of 811 millet and yielded one dou three sheng of rice, which was soft and delicious to eat. However, Xiguan planted more than ten mu of 811 millet this year, but due to lack of attention to technique and the use of three-legged drills, it was too dense, and as a result, some yields were even lower than local millet.

　　优良品种产量大
  　一亩金皇后赛过二亩土玉茭
    八一一谷每亩多打五斗
    【本报长治市讯】西南关干部今春动员种金皇后时，很多人都不愿种，认为不好吃，还少出面，费粪又费工。首先干部带头种，结果全村勉强种了九十六亩，想不开的人们就没有种上。今秋撇回来的金皇后，人人都说好，张富则一亩八分地，就拉了四车（每车打二石五），可打十石，王二猴拿了一穗大的上秤秤了一下，一穗就有一斤十两重，土玉茭七穗才秤了一斤十两。农会主席关福锁，十穗金皇后就打了七升，六个人吃面条，还余下两大碗，福锁母亲高兴的和工作员说：“金皇后做面条吃，又软又好吃，还省榆皮哩，早要知道可该都种成金皇后。”贵旺老婆说：“金皇后面就是好，蒸上圪瘩软溜溜的和熟米一样，越吃越想吃。”宋中孩今年把三亩好河地种上土玉茭，才拉了两车多，一亩多坏地种成金皇后就担回十二担（每担三斗半），中孩怕皮厚没敢多种，看见金皇后收的多，非常后悔，他媳妇骂他：“谁叫你不都种成金皇后来”。胡眼则组七户只种一亩多，都后悔的说：“不听政府号召你看吃多大亏哩，今年误了，明年都要种成金皇后”。外村人路过，都羡慕的说：“金皇后真好，明年要来换种籽。”全村九十六亩金皇后，最高每亩产四石五（市斗），平均每亩产三石，共收了三百余石，技委会收了十五石种子，集体保存在种籽仓库，准备向外调剂。全村三百亩土玉茭，每亩平均才产一石三，在这样的对比下，全村计划明年全部都要种金皇后，消灭土玉茭。西北街今年共种八一一谷四十一亩，每亩上肥三十担，锄三次，全用两条腿耧种，距离远近五寸到七寸，结果一棵最多的枝十三个杈，莠十三个穗。一般的只五、六个杈。生产主任李迷狗讲究技术，二亩地就打了六市石。全街种八一一谷四十一亩，每亩平均两石四斗，比土谷平均多打五斗。为向外推广，收了十石好种子。群众对八一一谷反映说：“八一一省工，打的又多，不怕小鸟吃”，迷狗家碾了二斗八一一谷，就出了一斗三升米，吃着发软很好吃。但西关今年种了十余亩八一一谷，由于不注意技术，全用三条腿耧种，太稠，结果有的打不过土谷。（马琳）
