Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 21st—Our reporter on the Jicha-Rehe-Liaoning front recently published a commentary on the brilliant achievements of the People's Liberation Army in Liaoxi over the past two months, stating: Immediately after bandit chief Chen Cheng arrived in the Northeast, he criticized Du Yuming's mistake of abandoning the Yebaishou and Lingyuan lines on the Jin-Cheng Road, saying that his first plan was to "ensure the Beining Road and open up the Jin-Cheng Road." This arrogant plan of his has finally gone bankrupt under the continuous attacks of the People's Liberation Army, and his ability to lose soldiers and generals seems to be even greater than that of Du Yuming. The first round of our Jicha-Rehe-Liaoning counter-offensive army's attacks on the Beining Road was the week from September 14th to 20th, with three victories in three battles, annihilating more than 16,000 Chiang bandit troops. The Beining Road, the Jiang bandits' blood vessel for transporting supplies in and out of Shanhaiguan and Jinzhou, was shattered and completely paralyzed. The second stage of the operation was a large-scale attack on the Jin-Cheng Road. In addition to completely destroying the Jinling Temple line in Jinzhou, from October 22nd to November 4th, in eleven days, we fought in Chaoyang, Xijiuguan and Taimen west of Yixian, and Jinjiatun north of Jinzhou, achieving a second brilliant victory with three victories in three battles. In two months of operations, a total of more than 27,000 enemy troops were annihilated. Most of these annihilated troops were the capital that Chen Cheng brought to the Northeast battlefield to sell his life. In the first Liaoxi victory, two divisions of the 49th Army newly transferred from northern Jiangsu were almost entirely wiped out, while the more than 6,000 men of the 92nd Army and 94th Army annihilated in the second victory had just been transferred from the North China battlefield. Our army captured more than 80 artillery pieces of various sizes, more than 30 trucks fully loaded with equipment, and more than 100 carts. Hou Jingru was beaten and fled in panic. This is another "masterpiece" of the Chen Cheng bandits in "ensuring the Beining Road and opening up the Jin-Cheng Road." No wonder senior officers such as Guo Huicang, the captured division commander of the 21st Division, and Ji Gaoxiang, his division chief of staff, all unanimously accused Chen Cheng of incompetent command. The "unprecedented victory in northwestern Yixian" boasted by the Chiang bandit Central News Agency is truly "preserved duck cooked in a pot, the meat is rotten but the mouth is still hard."

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 20th—Delayed news: From the 3rd to 5th of this month, a certain unit of the Democratic Allied Army carried out sabotage operations on the southern section of the Chiang bandit's Middle-Chang Road between Liaoyang and Anshan and its branch line between Liaoyang and Benxihu, completely burning more than 10,000 sleepers, power poles, and sixteen li of rails between Shahe and Shoushan in the Liaoyang-Anshan section, destroying four railway bridges, and destroying one station at Lingshan. The railway between Shoushan and Liaoyang was cut off, and 14 important strongholds such as Yinlingzi, Da'anping, and Diaobingtai were recovered at the same time. More than 80 Chiang bandits were captured.

　　辽西我军两个月六战六捷
  　陈诚狂妄计划破产
    【新华社东北前线二十一日电】冀察热辽前线记者顷就辽西两月来人民解放军之辉煌战绩，发表评论称：匪首陈诚到东北后甫告下车，即指责杜聿明弃守锦承路叶柏寿、凌源一线之失策，说他自己的第一个计划就是“确保北宁路，打通锦承路”，他这一狂妄计划，在人民解放军的连续打击下终于破产了，而他的损兵折将的本事较之于杜聿明倒似乎要高出一头。我冀察热辽反攻大军在北宁路出击的第一个回合是九月十四日到二十日的一周内三战三捷，歼灭蒋匪军一万六千余人。将蒋匪关内外输血管北宁路山海关锦州间打得支离破碎使其完全瘫痪。第二个阶段的作战是向锦承路大举出击，除将锦州金岭寺一线全部破坏外，十月二十二日至十一月四日的十一日中，一战朝阳，二战义县西九关台门，三战锦州以北金家屯，又获得了第二个三战三捷的辉煌胜利。两个月作战总计共歼敌达两万七千余名，这些被歼的部队大多是陈诚拿到东北战场来的卖命本钱，第一次辽西大捷，新从苏北调来的四十九军两个师几乎全部送了礼，而第二次大捷中被歼的九十二军和九十四军的六千多人却又是才从华北战场调来的，我军缴获了大小炮八十多门，满载装备的汽车三十余辆和大车百余辆，侯镜如被打得落荒而逃。这正是陈诚匪徒“确保北宁路，打通锦承路”的又一个“杰作”，无怪被俘的廿一师师长郭惠苍及其师参谋长纪高翔等高级军官都异口同声的责骂陈诚指挥无能了。蒋匪中央社吹嘘的所谓“义县西北获得空前大捷”的特等牛皮，真是“腊鸭烹在锅里，肉烂了嘴还是硬的。”
    【新华社东北前线二十日电】迟到消息：民主联军某部本月三日至五日向蒋匪中长路南段辽（阳）鞍（山）间及其支线辽（阳）本（溪湖）间进行破袭战，全部焚毁辽鞍段沙河、首山间枕木万余根，电杆及铁轨十六里，炸毁铁桥四座，毁灵山车站一处。切断首山辽阳间铁路，同时收复印领子、大安平、调兵台等重要据点十四处。歼俘蒋匪八十余名。
