    【This dispatch from Taihang on the 24th】Recently, the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandit gangs in the Yu Bei and Jinzhong areas have been wantonly imposing heavy taxes and levies of grain and materials on the residents of their occupied areas. In Shouyang, Qixian, Taigu and other counties, the Yan Xishan puppets, in order to achieve their extortion goals, organized "collection teams" and sent traitorous despots and secret agents to various villages to "supervise the collection." They stipulated that each mu of land must pay one dou and three sheng of grain. In Taigu, every tael of grain silver was equivalent to one shi and seven sheng, and in Qixian, it was one shi and six dou. The Yan Xishan puppets in Yuci were even more brutal, stipulating that every household, regardless of wealth or poverty, must pay taxes as long as they ate. If they did not want to pay grain, they had to exterminate their families and stop cooking. Anyone who refused to pay would be executed as "disguised elements." They also forcibly collected taxes on pigs, sheep, and chickens. For each pig raised for one month, five jin of meat were levied; for each sheep, seven jin; and for chickens, seven eggs per month. When pigs and sheep were slaughtered, heavy taxes were also levied. The local residents complained bitterly about the levies and fled to our area in droves. Zhang Dexi, who fled from Yongkang Village, said, "Yan Xishan is driving us all to our deaths." The Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Anyang, Yu Bei, stipulated that every tael of silver must be exchanged for 130 jin of wheat, one silver yuan, and 1,000 jin of dry firewood. The common people were worried about how to pay. In Xiuwu, because the Chiang Kai-shek bandits forced the peasants to repair ditches and build forts every day, most of the land was barren. Each bao (a local administrative unit) was also assigned 500 shi of wheat, 300 shi of corn, and 2,000 jin of horse feed. Some households could not pay even if they gave up all their grain.

　　蒋阎匪帮横征暴敛
    【本报太行廿四日电】豫北、晋中地区蒋、阎匪帮，近来大肆向其占领区居民强征粮食与物资。寿阳、祁县、太谷等县阎伪，为达到其勒索目的，均组织“征收组”，派遣奸霸特务到各村“督导征收”，规定每亩地缴粮一斗三升，太谷每两粮银为一石零七升，祁县为一石六斗。榆次阎伪更加残暴，规定每户不管贫富，只要吃饭即要征收，要想不缴粮，必须绝户断炊。有人不缴者，即以“伪装分子”处死。并强征猪、羊、鸡税，猪一口喂一月征肉五斤，羊七斤，鸡子是一月七个鸡蛋，如宰杀猪、羊时，又征收很重的税。当地居民被征的叫苦连天，纷纷逃来我区。永康村逃来之张德喜说：“阎锡山已把我们都快逼死了。”豫北安阳蒋匪规定每两银子征麦子一百卅斤、银洋一元、干柴一千斤，老百姓都愁着无法交付。修武由于蒋匪每日强逼农民修沟筑堡，大部土地荒芜，每保还派麦子五百石，玉茭三百石，马料二千斤，有的户即将所有粮全部倾出也难交清。
