Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: Moscow Dispatch: The thirtieth anniversary of the October Revolution is approaching. Workers in all Soviet factories are responding to the call of Leningrad workers to complete the annual production plan before the holiday with selfless work enthusiasm to greet the festival. According to the latest news, 400 factories in Moscow have completed their annual plans, and 9,000 Stakhanovite workers have completed two or even three times their annual production standards. All of Moscow's industry completed its November production plan on October 16th. Leningrad's industry, which suffered heavy damage, has recovered to the production level of 1940. National grocery industry, grain industry and fisheries production have victoriously completed the annual plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th: Moscow Dispatch: The Soviet Union is about to complete an unprecedented bountiful harvest. According to statistics from the Soviet State Planning Commission, the total grain production this year has increased by 58% compared to last year. As of October 5th, the national harvesting area has increased by 7.7 million hectares compared to the same period last year (approximately 16 Chinese acres per hectare). The planting area has increased by 3.8 million hectares. According to estimates by Reuters and Associated Press reporters, the bumper harvest will allow the Soviet Union to abolish the wartime rationing system, and allow the Soviet Union to export at least 5 million tons of surplus grain in addition to exporting grain to countries that have already placed orders with the Soviet Union according to the original plan. The main reason for the Soviet Union's bumper harvest this year is the result of the Soviet people's high labor enthusiasm and the combination of the latest science and technology under the strong help of the Soviet government. For example, experts from the Academy of Agricultural Sciences helped collective farms ensure the selection of production seeds, use airplanes to sow, fertilize, and eliminate insects, organize automobile patrol teams to help harvest, develop water conservancy irrigation, and strengthen electrification and other efforts, once again creating a miracle of socialist production. Particularly astonishing is the agricultural aviation industry, which has now completed and exceeded the plan originally scheduled to be completed in 1950. This year, locusts in Central Asia were eliminated by airplanes. Aerial fertilization has increased wheat yields by 25% and rice yields by 15% in some areas. The achievements in electrification are also great. This year, 7,500 rural thermal and hydroelectric power stations have been newly built, and the number of electrified collective farms has increased to 30,000.

    迎接十月革命三十周年
    苏联工人热烈增产
    提前完成全年计划
    苏联农业空前丰收
    较去年增产百分之五十八
    农业航空已超过五年计划
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】莫斯科讯：十月革命三十周年纪念即将来临，全苏各工厂工人正以忘我之工作热情，以响应列宁格勒工人在节日前完成全年生产计划迎接节日的号召。据最近消息，莫斯科有四百所工厂已完成全年计划，有九千名斯塔哈诺夫工人已完成两倍甚至三倍于全年生产标准之工作，莫斯科全部工业在十月十六日已完成十一月之生产计划。受损惨重之列宁格勒工业，已恢复到一九四○年之生产水准。全国杂货工业、粮食工业及渔业生产已胜利完成全年计划。
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】莫斯科讯：苏联现即将完成空前丰稔之收获。据苏联国家计划委员会之统计，今年谷物生产总额较去年增加百分之五十八；截至十月五日为止，全国收割面积较去年同期增加七百七十万公顷（按一公顷约等于十六华亩）。播种面积增加三百八十万公顷。据路透社及美联社记者估计，丰收将使苏联取消自战时以来之口粮配给制；并使苏联除按原定计划向已与苏联订购粮食各国输出谷物外，至少尚有余粮五百万吨可供输出。苏联今年丰收之主要原因，是苏联人民在苏联政府大力帮助下，以高度劳动热情与最新科学技术结合之结果。如由农业科学院专家帮助集体农场保证生产选种，利用飞机播种、施肥、除虫，组织汽车巡回队帮助收割，发展水利灌溉，加强电气化等等努力，已再度造成社会主义生产之奇迹。其中尤为惊人者，为农业航空事业，现在即完成并超过原定于一九五○年完成之计划，今年中亚细亚之蝗虫即由飞机灭除。空中施肥，使若干地区小麦产量增加百分之二十五，大米百分之十五。电汽化方面之成就亦极大，今年增建之农村火力、水力发电站达七千五百处，电气化之集体农场，已增至三万所。
