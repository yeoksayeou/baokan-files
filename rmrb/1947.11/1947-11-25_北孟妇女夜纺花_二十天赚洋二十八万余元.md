　　Women in Beimeng Spin Cotton at Night
    Earn Over 280,000 Yuan in Twenty Days
    [This newspaper's report from Lincheng] Under the leadership of the Women's Federation, Beimeng Village has thirteen mutual aid teams, one mutual aid brigade, sixteen looms, and fifty-three spinning wheels. In twenty nights, they spun 110 jin of cotton, earning 176,300 yuan; and wove 165 bolts of cloth, earning 100,800 yuan. During the day, they also completed tasks such as making military shoes and socks, handing in public grain, and grinding flour. Eight labor models were discovered, including poor peasant women Wang Xijie and Wang Xiaoyou. In particular, Wang Xin'ai, who led her children in spinning an average of half a jin of cotton per night, played a key role and influenced the entire group to work harder at weaving and spinning. Now, Three Streets is conducting a challenge, with mutual inspections to ensure fine spinning and even weaving, and to combine this with cultural learning, so that production and learning are not neglected. Each team has a small blackboard, with children taking turns teaching, further boosting the morale of the women. (Shuren)

　　北孟妇女夜纺花
    二十天赚洋二十八万余元
    【本报临城讯】北孟村在妇联会领导下，十三个互助组，一个互助大队，十六个织布机，五十三个纺车，二十天晚上纺花一百一十斤，赚洋十七万六千三百元，织布一百六十五个，赚洋十万零八千元，白天还完成了军鞋、军袜、交公粮推碾等任务。发现了贫苦农妇王喜姐、王小有等八名劳动模范。特别是王心爱，晚上领着孩子，每晚平均纺花半斤，起了骨干作用，影响全组加油织纺。现在三道街正进行着挑战，相互检查，保证纺的细织的匀，并要结合文化学习，做到生产、学习两不误。每个组里有小黑板，儿童轮流教，妇女情绪更为提高。（淑仁）
