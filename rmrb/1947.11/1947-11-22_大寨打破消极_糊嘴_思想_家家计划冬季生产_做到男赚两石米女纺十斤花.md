　　Dazhai Breaks with the Passive "Just Getting By" Mentality
  　Every Household Plans Winter Production
    Aiming for Men to Earn Two Shi of Rice and Women to Spin Ten Jin of Cotton
    [Our newspaper, Taihang, 20th dispatch] After calculating their assets and comparing time, the peasants of Dazhai, Yushe, have broken with the passive mentality of being satisfied with "just getting by," and every household has formulated a winter production and home-building plan. This year, the village's agricultural and sideline income averages more than seven shi and four dou of coarse grain and over three hundred jin of vegetables per person. As a result, the masses are generally complacent. Turned-over peasants Zhang Wanqian and Zhang Bujin said, "We've harvested enough grain for three years, so there's nothing to worry about!" In order to remove this stumbling block to mobilizing winter production, the leadership first helped Zhang Wanqian calculate his time. During the calculation, Wanqian said, "This year, I've been raising seedlings and earning wages, and with my child herding sheep, the two of us have earned a total of twenty-six shi and six dou of coarse grain. After deducting food, clothing, miscellaneous expenses, and handing over the counter-attack grain, we still have a surplus of twelve shi and six dou and five sheng. I've lived for fifty-some years, and this is the first good year." At this time, the cadre said to him, "If you don't plan for production and building a home, does that mean your family has everything?" This enlightenment made Wanqian say, "Besides the land and the few grains I've harvested, I don't have anything else." He then formulated a home-building plan: buying half a head of cattle would cost six shi of grain, two sheep would cost two shi of grain, repairing the house and buying agricultural tools would cost eight shi of grain, and the child will also need to go to school next year. According to this calculation, he is still short three shi, five dou, and five sheng, so he must work hard this winter to make up for it. After his household's calculation was made public, it motivated the whole village to hold family meetings, calculate assets, and plan for building a home. From households to groups, and from groups to the village, it was unanimously proposed: "Responding to the call of the county party committee, this winter, men must earn two shi of rice and women must spin ten jin of cotton." With the poor and hired peasants as the backbone, twenty-nine men formed transport groups, wool weaving groups, etc., planning to earn one hundred shi of grain; thirty-two women are spinning and weaving in exchange for eighty-three shi of grain.

　　大寨打破消极“糊嘴”思想
  　家家计划冬季生产
    做到男赚两石米女纺十斤花
    【本报太行二十日电】榆社大寨农民，经过算家当、比时光，打破满足于“糊嘴”的消极思想，家家户户订出冬季生产建家计划。该村今年农副业收入，每人平均七石四斗多粗粮，菜三百多斤。因此，群众普遍自满。翻身农民张万钱、张补金说：“今年打下三年的粮食不怕啦！”领导上为踢开发动冬季生产这块绊脚石，便先帮助张万钱算时光。计算中万钱说：“我今年闹养种，连赚工资和孩子放羊，两口共收入二十六石六斗粗粮，除吃穿、杂支、交反攻粮外，还余十二石六斗五。我活了五十来年，这是头一年好。”这时干部对他说：“你不再计划生产发家，家里是不是啥都有啦？”这一启发，万钱说：“我除了有地和打的几颗粮食外，啥也还没有。”接着，便订出建家计划：买半头牛用谷六石，二只羊用谷两石，修房、买农具用谷八石，孩子明年还要上学。按这样算，还短三石五斗五，今冬还得好好生产来补足。经他一户算了公布后，推动全村都开家庭会，算家当，计划建家。由户到组，由组到村，一致提出：“响应县委号召，今冬男人要赚两石米，女人要纺十斤花”。并以贫雇为骨干，二十九个男人分别组成担运组，毛织组等，计划赚粮一百石；妇女三十二个，纺织换粮八十三石。
