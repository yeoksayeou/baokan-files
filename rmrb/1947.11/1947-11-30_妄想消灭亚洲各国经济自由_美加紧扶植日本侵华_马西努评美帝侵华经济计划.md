Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 27th: Moscow Radio broadcast Marcinu's commentary on the 25th, pointing out that U.S. imperialism is planning to completely control China's economy through the so-called "economic cooperation between China, Japan, Korea, and the Philippines," turning China into a U.S. colony. The full text of the commentary is as follows:

　　On November 18th, the Shanghai China Press published a brief but significant piece of news, stating that when the United States was conducting negotiations on aid to Chiang, the Chiang Kai-shek government agreed to U.S. supervision of the loans; during the negotiations, the United States proposed "economic cooperation" between China, Japan, Korea, and the Philippines. This news once again confirms that the so-called Marshall Plan to aid Chiang is part of the Far East plan of the U.S. capital's plan to enslave the Chinese people's economy. The U.S. bankers in power are currently trying to implement this plan in Europe and in the Far East and Asia. On November 15th, an Indonesian newspaper commented on this news, saying: Powerful U.S. banking groups are attempting to Americanize Asian countries. According to the secretariat of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, the commission's meeting will be held in the Philippines soon, at which the implementation of the Marshall Plan in Asia will be discussed. The newspaper continued: The Marshall Plan to aid Asian countries is no different from the plans to aid Greece and Turkey.

　　The United States is attempting to eliminate the economic freedom of Asian countries. The foundation of the U.S. plan to enslave the people of the world is to restore the potential of the German and Japanese military industries, which are currently under the supervision of U.S. monopoly capitalists. U.S. monopoly capitalists and their representatives have repeatedly stated this publicly. For example, the U.S. Undersecretary of the Army openly stated at a press conference in Tokyo on September 27th that the United States' goal is to transform Japan into an industrial manufacturing center in the Far East. The next day, in a radio program on the Marshall Plan on San Francisco radio station, David Stern, a Far East reporter for the Democratic Radio Broadcasting Company, also said: According to the U.S. authorities, Japan should be given the necessary Asian market. On November 14th, the Japan Times published an article by Burns, a Tokyo reporter for the United Press, in which he wrote: Not long ago, MacArthur and members of his headquarters pointed out that the future of the Japanese economy lies in Asia, especially in China. The raw materials and food of North China and Manchuria are very important for the economic recovery of Japan, and Japan has relied on these sources for the past fifteen years. He also said: According to MacArthur's statement, Japan's political situation is related to "the outcome of the struggle for Asian ideology." MacArthur expressed concern about this, believing that China's (referring to Chiang Kai-shek's) bankruptcy would cause Japan's bankruptcy. The so-called bankruptcy of Japan mentioned by U.S. imperialism is naturally the bankruptcy of the U.S. plan to utilize Japan. They are attempting to use Japan as a tool to seize Asia as a source of raw materials and food, and a market for selling goods, turning Asian and Far Eastern countries into U.S. colonies. The so-called bankruptcy of China in the mouths of U.S. imperialists is actually the bankruptcy of the U.S. imperialist plan to establish a Far East manufacturing center and establish U.S. colonies in Asia. The "struggle for Asian ideology" mentioned by Burns refers to the victory of Asian countries in the struggle for democratic liberation, for the development of their own independent economies, for democratic revival, and for the struggle against the imperialist forces headed by the United States that attempt to enslave the sovereignty of these countries. The U.S. reporter's article exposes the creators of the Chinese civil war and helps people understand why the United States has spent hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars to support the Chinese civil war, and why the United States is helping the Kuomintang oppose the patriotic democratic forces in China, because these forces are the biggest obstacle to the United States' implementation of its colonial plan, undermining the U.S. imperialists' attempts.

　　North China and Manchuria, which had been the source of raw materials and food that Japan relied on in the past fifteen years, are now closed. It is no longer a sales market for Japanese textile and light industrial products. The democratic regime in the liberated areas is not for the benefit of Japanese capitalists and their new masters, U.S. imperialists, but for the benefit of the Chinese people themselves, for the development of national light industry, and for the development of national industry and commerce to utilize these raw materials and food. Therefore, in order to obtain North China and Manchuria, the U.S. imperialists equip and train the Kuomintang army, and the U.S. imperialist running dogs shout loudly: These areas are China's "lifeline." The "lifeline" they are shouting about refers to the lifeline of the Japanese financial groups ruled by U.S. capitalists. The Kuomintang reactionaries, according to Washington's instructions, have restored trade relations with Japan, opening the door for the United States to dump Japanese goods, harming the interests of Chinese national industry and commerce. They agreed to the U.S. suggestion to give Japan one million tons of salt to restore Japan's military chemical factories. The news from the China Press quoted above confirms that U.S. capitalists have adopted the Far East plan of the Marshall Plan as one of the conditions for their new aid to the Kuomintang. This plan includes turning China, Korea, and the Philippines into Japanese colonies in the U.S. sphere.

　　妄想消灭亚洲各国经济自由
  　美加紧扶植日本侵华
    马西努评美帝侵华经济计划
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】莫斯科电台二十五日广播马西努评论，指出美帝国主义正计划经由所谓“中、日、韩、菲经济合作”步骤，完全控制中国经济，变中国为美国殖民地，评论全文如下：
    十一月十八日，上海华美晚报公布了一篇简略而具有意义的消息，其中说：美国在进行关于援蒋的谈判时，蒋介石政府同意美国对贷款的监督；在谈判进行中，美国提议中、日与朝鲜、菲律宾进行“经济合作”。这个消息再次证实了所谓援蒋的马歇尔计划，是美国资本奴役中国人民经济计划之远东方案的一部分，当权的美国银行家们现时力图在欧洲及在远东和亚洲实现这个计划。十一月十五日印尼报纸在评论这个消息时说道：美国有势力的银行集团企图使亚洲各国美国化。据联合国所属的亚洲及远东经济委员会秘书处声称：最近将于菲律宾举行这个委员会的会议，在这个会议上将讨论在亚洲实行马歇尔计划的问题。该报继续写道：关于援助亚洲各国的马歇尔计划，是与援助希腊、土耳其计划没有丝毫分别的。
    美国企图消灭亚洲各国的经济自由。美国奴役世界人民的经济计划之基础，就是恢复现受美国独占资本家监督的德国和日本军事工业的潜势力。美国独占资本家及其代表，关于这点，曾经屡次公开说过，如美国陆军次长在九月二十七日的东京记者招待会上，即公开声称：美国的目的是将日本变成为远东工业制造所。在第二天旧金山广播电台关于马歇尔计划的问题专栏广播中，民主无线电广播公司远东记者弗斯德也说：根据美国当局的意见，应给予日本以必需的亚洲市场。十一月十四日日本时报登载了合众社东京记者布茵斯的论文，其中写道：不久以前麦克阿瑟及其总部委员都已指明，日本经济的前途将在于亚洲，特别是在中国。华北与满洲的原料与粮食，对于日本经济复兴甚为重要，日本十五年来即依靠这些来源。又说：根据麦克阿瑟声言，日本的政治状态是与“争取亚洲思想斗争之结局”有关系的。麦克阿瑟认为中国（指蒋介石）的破产会引起日本的破产，因而对此表示关心。美帝国主义所说的日本破产，自然是美国利用日本计划的破产，他们企图以日本为工具，来夺取亚洲作为其原料与粮食的来源地，和销售商品的市场，将亚洲和远东各国变成为美国的殖民地。美帝国主义者口中所谓中国的破产，实际就是美国建立远东制造所和建立美国的亚洲殖民地的帝国主义计划之破产。布茵斯说到的所谓“争取亚洲思想斗争”，这是指亚洲各国争取民主解放的胜利，争取自己国家独立经济的发展，争取民主复兴，并与以美国为首的企图奴役这些国家主权的帝国主义力量进行斗争。美国记者的论文，把中国内战的制造者揭露了出来，并帮助人们明白美国所以化了几十万万美元来支持中国的内战，美国之所以帮助国民党反对中国爱国民主力量，是因为这些力量乃是美国实行其殖民地计划的最大障碍，使美帝国主义者的企图受到破坏。
    华北与满洲在过去十五年内，曾是日本所依靠的原料与粮食的来源地，现在被封闭了，它已不再作为日本纺织和轻工业产品的销售市场。解放区的民主政权不是为了日本资本家及其新主人美帝国主义者之利益，而是为了中国人民自己的利益，为了发展民族轻工业，为了发展民族工商业而利用这些原料与粮食。因此美帝国主义者为了取得华北与满洲，就装备与训练国民党军队，美帝国主义的走狗就大喊大叫的：这些区域是中国的“生命线”。他们所叫喊的“生命线”，是指为美国资本家所统治之日本财阀的生命线。国民党反动分子按照华盛顿的指示，已与日本恢复了贸易关系，为美国倾销日货打开了门户，以损害中国民族工商的利益。他们同意了美国建议，给予日本一百万吨食盐，来恢复日本的军用化学工厂。上面所引证的华美晚报的消息中，证实了美国资本家采纳马歇尔计划的远东方案，作为他们给国民党新援助的条件之一。在这个方案里，包括把中国和朝鲜及菲律宾一起变成美国化的日本殖民地的分区。
