　　Peking University Students Go to the Front Lines
　　Ten Thousand Middle School Students Care for the Wounded

　　[Report from this newspaper] To strive for the early arrival of the victory of the great counter-offensive, another group of Peking University students have left the school for the front lines. There are 33 from the College of Arts and Education, 7 from the College of Engineering, and 5 from the College of Finance and Economics, totaling 45. At the farewell meeting, Dean Zhang of the College of Arts said to everyone: "I hope everyone can be an unsung hero, serving the people wholeheartedly." On the morning of the 30th, amidst the sounds of gongs and drums, the entire college saw them off for several miles. (Wu Min, Ge Yi, Jian Yi)

　　[Report from this newspaper, Wan Quan] To support the front lines, the students of Wan Quan Middle School have successively requested the school to allow them to participate in nursing work in hospitals. On October 23rd alone, 53 students signed up. The school, based on the students' different situations regarding their physical condition, age, etc., decided to send 33 students. The students who remained at the school, unable to go in person, initiated a donation movement to comfort the wounded soldiers. At that time, there were 163 people, donating a total of 15,950 yuan.
