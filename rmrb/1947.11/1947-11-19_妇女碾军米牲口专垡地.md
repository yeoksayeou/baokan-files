　　[Report from our newspaper in Southern Hebei, dated the 14th] During the intense autumn plowing campaign, Donggao Village in Yuan Dynasty accepted the additional task of grinding 500 jin of rice and milling 500 jin of wheat for the military station. Due to the scarcity of livestock, drawing them away for grinding and milling would likely affect the autumn plowing. Therefore, village chief Ma Yu convened a discussion among male and female team leaders and above. Some team leaders suggested "using smaller livestock for grinding and milling." Others proposed: "Grinding and milling in the early morning and late evening." Finally, Women's Association Deputy Director Yang Guizhi said, "We are currently in the midst of an intense autumn plowing campaign, and the livestock are plowing during the day, and if they work at night, it might be too tiring. I think it would be better to assign the tasks to our Women's Association by groups, with each group handling 100 jin, which can be pushed through in a day." After everyone agreed, they decided to divide it among six groups. Yang Guizhi's group and Zhang Yue's group each took 117.5 jin of wheat and began pushing it early in the morning. The entire group was mobilized during the pushing, and even three people with malaria participated.

　　妇女碾军米牲口专垡地
    【本报冀南十四日电】元朝东高村在突击秋耕中又接受了与兵站碾五百斤米、磨五百斤麦的任务。因牲口很少，如抽牲口碾磨，恐怕秋耕受影响。因此村长马玉召集男女组长以上干部讨论，有的组长提出“用小牲口碾磨。”有的提出：“早晚碾磨。”最后妇会副主任杨桂芝说：“现在正在突击秋耕当中，牲口白天犁地，夜晚还干活恐怕太累。我看不如给俺们妇会按组分开，一组一百斤，一天就能推完。”经大家同意后，随决意分开六组。杨桂芝组、张月组每组一百一十七斤半麦子，早晨即开始推，推时全体总动员，有三个发疟子的也都参加了。
