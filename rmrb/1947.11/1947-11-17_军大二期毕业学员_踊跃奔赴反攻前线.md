　　Second Phase Graduates of the Military University
    Eagerly Head to the Counter-Offensive Front

    [Reported by this newspaper] The second phase students of the Military and Political University, after five months of education in current affairs and policies, the four major techniques, the three major tasks, political work, and land reform, completed their studies in early November and are heading to the forefront of the great counter-offensive. On November 2nd and 3rd, solemn graduation ceremonies and commendation meetings were held, which naturally evolved into rallies vowing to defeat Chiang Kai-shek due to the passionate atmosphere. Vice President Zhou encouraged everyone to earnestly implement the three major documents issued by the People's Liberation Army on Double Tenth Day and to go to the front lines and make more contributions. The entire liberated farmers of ×× Village, where the university was stationed, upon hearing of the graduation, spontaneously held meetings overnight, elected representatives to bid farewell to all the graduating students, and presented a banner. Guo Jingheng, the representative of the graduating students, resolutely stated: "We will certainly make contributions to the people at the front and vow not to return home until Chiang Kai-shek is defeated!" All the graduating students solemnly swore before the images of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, vowing to fight for the overthrow of Chiang Kai-shek and the establishment of a new China! Upon hearing that these graduating students were heading south, the villagers have been continuously sending comfort bags, gifts, and invitations for meals. At the farewell meetings of each brigade, the villagers repeatedly urged: "After you get to the front, please send back more news of victory." When the graduating students departed, the villagers beat drums and gongs and saw them off a long way. The students' reply to the villagers was: "We will never fail the encouragement and aspirations of the villagers, and we will never return home until all the poor villagers have been thoroughly liberated!"
