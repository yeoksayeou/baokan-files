    Determines Drainage Plan for Next Year
    [Our newspaper, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 26th dispatch] The Sixth Administrative Office established a water conservancy section to determine the drainage plan for next year, to uniformly lead the dredging of main and branch streams, and to rectify ditches and canals. A water management meeting of various counties was specially convened on the 6th of this month. Participants included the Administrative Office, the Special Commissioner's Office, the Fourth Repair and Prevention Office, and counties such as Zhuxian, Boping, and Dong'a. The meeting conducted group discussions and research, clarifying several issues: (1) It was determined that water management is the urgent demand of the masses, and unified river management actions should be taken next year to thoroughly overcome localism; (2) Organizational structure: The Special Commissioner's Office has established a water conservancy section, led by the Fourth Repair and Prevention Office. It was proposed to restore the Special County Construction Section, and set up construction assistants in the districts. At present, each county will add one to three cadres according to the needs of water conservancy work, led by the office, to be responsible for water management. (3) Dredge main and branch streams, and rectify ditches and canals. It was determined that the Grand Canal, the Tuhai River, the Majia River, and the Zhao Niu River are the main streams. Dredge the Grand Canal and the Tuhai River according to the measured plans of the Administrative Office Construction Department, deepening without widening. Widen and deepen the Majia River, survey and deepen the Zhao Niu River, and increase the repair of the main streams. The Shunshui ditch that has been dug this year will not be filled, and those that need it will be repaired; (4) Manpower and material resources: The principle of economy should be followed, calling on the masses to dig rivers for self-help, contributing more labor and spending less money. (5) Land occupation: According to the actual situation, the village will adjust the excess, and the insufficient will be exempt from burden. (6) Dike and river protection: No crops are allowed to be planted on the dikes and riverbeds of each river. Tree planting should be launched, and reeds in the riverbeds must be cut. (7) Work steps: Complete the survey and measurement of various main and branch streams this winter, and prepare materials for the bridges and culverts of large projects. Complete the digging of the river in March of next spring, and complete the construction of bridges and culverts by the end of May.
    [Our newspaper, Taiyue, 26th dispatch] Beiyuan Village in Qin Yuan experienced an increase of five dou per mu in the autumn harvest through irrigation using ditches. Therefore, on the 17th of this month, after the rush to complete the autumn plowing, more than eighty full and half laborers were organized under the leadership of poor peasant Lu Wangcai, divided into fourteen groups, and rushed to repair ditches. The amount of labor required is calculated according to the amount of land irrigated. Those who pay more receive wages or return labor. Land occupation is priced and sold according to the number of mu and output, and the price is paid by the irrigating households based on the number of mu irrigated. Within five days, a large ditch five li long, four chi deep, and three chi wide was built. It is estimated that more than 1,600 mu of land can be irrigated next spring.
