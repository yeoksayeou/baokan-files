Eighth Special District of Hebei-Shandong-Henan Deep Drains and Plants 5,000 Hectares of Wheat
	100,000 People Mobilized to Dig Rivers and Open Ditches for Over 50 Kilometers
	Poor and Hired Peasants Take the Lead in Jiyuan Third District, Expanding Wheat Fields by 10,000 Mu
	[Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 12th Dispatch] After draining water in Puyang and Neihuang, wheat fields expanded by 5,000 hectares. According to a comprehensive report from the Eighth Special Commissioner's Office: This autumn, there was continuous heavy rain, and much of the area is low-lying, leading to water accumulation and the formation of lakes, especially in Puyang and Neihuang. The Commissioner's Office paid close attention to draining accumulated water in September. On September 14th, a river management committee was established, specifically responsible for water management work. From September 20th to October 23rd, after one month and three days of effort, a total of 100,500 workers were mobilized, consuming 300,150 catties of grain and 451,000 catties of firewood. A total of 101 li of rivers were dug, three rivers were dredged, and three new drainage canals were opened, expanding wheat fields by more than 5,000 hectares. Calculated at 3 dan per mu, next year's harvest can be increased by more than 1.5 million dan, equivalent to the annual income of a medium-sized county.
	[This newspaper, Taiyue, 12th Dispatch] Poor and hired peasants in Jiyuan Third District take the lead in expanding wheat fields, and continue to increase planting. Since the cadre and poor peasant representative meeting was held on the 18th of last month, villages have universally launched a campaign to increase planting and counter-attack wheat. According to statistics from 32 villages, in half a month, 42,403.7 mu have been planted, an increase of 8,824.2 mu compared to last year, plus 2,577.6 mu planted on newly reclaimed land, totaling 11,401.8 mu. The main reason for the rapid completion of autumn planting and the expansion of wheat fields is that the villages have organized themselves with poor and hired peasants as the leading core, and insisted on a surprise rush planting. After returning to the village from the district meeting, the village cadres of Liucun Village discussed with the poor peasant group and decided: (1) Guarantee that not a single mu of land is left uncultivated. (2) Men, women, young and old, all go to the fields together. Therefore, the poor and hired peasants went back and actively investigated the various difficulties in cultivation, dug out two vats of wheat hidden by the target of struggle, Liang Fazhe, solving the problem of wheat seeds for 24 poor peasant households. The heads of various mutual aid groups in Beiguanzhuang are all poor and hired peasants. After clearing up the various ideological obstacles of the masses, they worked through the night with lanterns, leading the masses to rush to plow and plant. Most of the women in the villages went to the fields during the day to break up soil clumps and pull rollers, and ground flour at night, saving animal power. Secondly, the various difficulties of the poor and hired peasants have been appropriately resolved. For the wheat seed item alone, according to statistics from 17 villages, 30 dan and 6 dou and 7 sheng were allocated from the fruits of struggle and adjustments from grain households, and more than 270 dan were borrowed from the bank. As for the difficulty of livestock for the poor and hired peasants, more attention was given. For example, the Chengcun Mutual Aid Group proposed that those poor and hired peasants who have labor power should repay with work, and those who do not have labor power should be taken care of, and the mutual aid group should guarantee that the land of the poor and hired peasants is cultivated as well as their own. Therefore, this year the planting of wheat by poor and hired peasants has exceeded any previous year, and the amount of wheat planted is almost the same as that of middle peasants. According to statistics from Macun, there are 76 poor and hired households in the village, with 201 people. This year, they planted 403 mu of wheat, an average of 2.05 mu per person. There are 73 middle peasant households, with 104 people, and they planted 443.5 mu of wheat, an average of 2.17 mu per person. At the same time, in the tense cultivation, they first cultivated the land of military cadres, martyrs' families, and participating civilian workers. For example, the land of 273 military cadres, martyrs' families, and participating militiamen in Macun and other six villages was also planted in 16 days. Thirdly, call for large-scale land reclamation, and solve the problem of wasteland burdens. The masses discussed and decided on the basis of land properties to exempt burdens for a period of years, and then the village office issued a wasteland certificate, stating the exemption period, which is divided into five grades, from one to five years. If it is particularly bad, it can be extended to ten years without bearing the burden. When the masses of Wangzhai Village discussed the "piercing arrow" (grass name) land, some people said: "Planting this land is unlucky." Later, after discussion, someone went to open it up with the exception of ten years. On the 2nd of this month, the district held another cadre meeting, calling for "launching the final attack," and in seven to ten days, continue to squeeze time, squeeze land, squeeze manpower, and squeeze animal power to increase the planting of "counter-attack wheat."

　　冀鲁豫八专区疏水种麦五千顷
    十万群众齐动员挖河开沟百余里
    济源三区贫雇带头  扩大麦田万亩
    【冀鲁豫十二日电】濮阳内黄疏水后；扩大麦田五千顷。据八专署综合消息：入秋霪雨滂沱，本区地多下洼，因而积水成湖，尤以濮阳、内黄为最，专署于九月份即极注意排泄积水事宜，九月十四日成立治河委员会，专门负责治水工作，自九月二十日至十月二十三日一月零三天的努力，计动员民工十万零五百名，用粮三十万零一千五百斤，柴四十五万一千斤，共挖河长一百零一华里，疏通了三条河、开辟了三条新泄水渠，扩大麦田五千余顷，每亩以三石计算，明年可增进收量一百五十余万石，抵一个中等县全年的收入。
    【本报太岳十二日电】济源三区贫雇带头扩大麦田，现继续增种。自上月十八日召开干部及贫雇代表会议后，各村便普遍展开增种反攻麦运动，现据三十二村统计，半月内已种麦四万二千四百零三亩七分，较去年增加麦田八千八百二十四亩二分，加上新开荒地种麦二千五百七十七亩六分，共一万一千四百零一亩八分。所以能如此迅速完成秋种扩大麦田，主要原因是各村以贫雇为领导核心，组织起来，坚持突击抢种的结果。留村村干部在区上开会回村后，即与贫雇小组讨论决定：（一）保证不留一亩荒地。（二）男女老少一齐下地。于是贫雇回去便积极调查耕种的各种困难，将斗争对象梁法哲暗藏的两缸麦刨出来，解决了二十四户贫雇农的麦籽困难。北官庄各个互助组长都是贫雇，他们打通了群众各种思想障碍后，连夜打上灯笼，领群众抢犁抢种。各村大部妇女白天上地打圪塔，拉砘，黑夜回来磨面，节省了畜力。其次，贫雇的各种困难得到了适当的解决，仅麦籽一项，据十七村的统计，从斗争果实中与向有粮户调剂出三十石六斗七升，并向银行贷了二百七十余石。至于贫雇的牲口困难，更得到了照顾，如程村互助组提出贫雇有劳力者还工，没劳力者便作为照顾，由互助组保证把贫雇农的土地与自己的一样种好。因此今年全区贫雇种麦已超过已往任何一年，与中农种麦数量几乎相等。据马村统计，全村贫雇七十六户，二百零一口人，今年种麦四百零三亩，每人平均二亩零五厘，中农七十三户，一百零四口人，种麦四百四十三亩五分，每人平均二亩一分七厘。同时，各村在紧张的耕种中，又先尽军干烈属及参战民工的土地种好，如马村等六村的二百七十三户军干烈属及参战民兵的土地亦在十六天中种上。再次，号召大量开荒，并解决了荒地负担问题，由群众根据土地性质讨论决定，免除负担年限，然后由村公所发给荒地证明书，写明免除年限，共分五等，由一年至五年，如特别坏的，可以延长到十年不负担。王寨群众讨论到“穿心箭”（草名）地时，有人说：“种上这地倒霉。”后来讨论，除免十年就有人去开了。本月二日，该区又召开干部会议，号召“最后将一军”，在七天至十天内，继续挤时间、挤土地、挤人力、挤畜力，增种“反攻麦”。
