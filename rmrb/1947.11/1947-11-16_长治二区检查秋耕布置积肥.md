　　Changzhi Second District Inspects Autumn Plowing, Arranges Manure Accumulation
　　[Report from this newspaper, Changzhi] On October 30th, the Second District convened eighty key cadres including labor heroes, model political directors, from three sub-districts like Dongling to inspect autumn plowing. First, it was decided to conduct on-site visits and inspections. After everyone's research, the purpose of the visit was threefold: (1) autumn plowing achievements; (2) equivalent reward measures; (3) mass response to autumn plowing. The slogan put forward after research was: "The visiting group should be patient, and the three inspection points should be serious!" Everyone was divided into three large teams and six subgroups to inspect in the field and in the villages, from 7:00 am to late afternoon, finally gathering in Jiazhang to talk. After everyone's mutual comparison and analysis, there were mainly two types: one type of village, such as Tumeng, Tianhe, and fifteen other villages, plowed and dug deeply and evenly, and quickly. From a distance, one could see a red field. Especially in Tumeng, corn stalks and stubble firewood were all smoked in holes, with both ash and manure, and the edges and ends of the fields were carefully dug over. Labor hero Cao Linshui said, "The Eighth Route Army went south to dig out the old roots, and we, the suffering people, dig out the old roots in the fields." The second type, such as Shantou, Shenjiazhuang, and five other villages, some individuals, starting from a task-oriented viewpoint, used a three-legged rake to quickly plow along the ridges, just to show to others. Some didn't even clear the corn stalks, and autumn plowing was left unfinished. The leadership asked why the villages with good autumn plowing were both fast and good? They asked everyone to start a discussion to find the reasons. After a heated and repeated debate, three key experiences were clarified: (1) Breaking down ideological obstacles to autumn plowing, comprehensively organizing all full and semi-auxiliary labor; (2) Equivalent rewards are fair and reasonable, exceeding the standard rewards, and women and children implemented a family 20-80 profit split; (3) Cadres personally take action, deeply delve into mutual assistance to discover problems, and promptly handle them. The red flag competition method turned backward groups into model groups. Then they discussed and arranged to launch a ten-day manure accumulation campaign, resolutely not leaving a single stubble, thoroughly cutting off the small tails, bundling grass and beating beans. Thoroughly clearing the fields, cleaning everything up, women fermenting vegetables and sewing clothes, men clearing wasteland and burning ash, and launching a frugality campaign, summarizing autumn plowing to select models, inspecting the "plow three, keep one" system, combined with financial rectification work. Everyone unanimously agreed to accept the glorious task, shouting: "This year, compare manure piles after autumn, next year, compare grain piles on the threshing ground, you can't survive a famine without eating chaff, you eat food fast without eating vegetables!"

　　长治二区检查秋耕布置积肥
    【本报长治讯】二区在十月三十号召集东岭等三个小区劳英模范政治主任等八十名主要干部检查秋耕。首先决定实地参观检查，经大家研究参观意图有三点：（一）秋耕成绩；（二）等价奖励办法，（三）群众对秋耕反映。研究后提的口号是：“参观团要耐心，检查三点要认真！”大家分为三大队六小组，到野外，到村里，奔波检查，由上午七点检查到下午太阳一杆高，最后齐集贾掌交谈。经大家互相对比分析后，主要有两种类型，一种类型村如土门、天河等十五个村，犁的掘的又深又平，还快，离远照见一片红地，特别是土门，将玉茭杆及茬子柴草等都薰洞，又有灰又有粪，并将地边地头都细掘过。劳英曹林水说：“八路军南征刨老根，咱们受苦人在地刨老根”，二种类型，如山头、申家庄等五个村，有个别人为了任务观点出发，利用三条腿耧随垅轰过，当别人眼，有个别地把玉茭杆也没闹清，并且秋耕留有尾巴。领导上提出秋耕好的村庄为什么又快又好呢？让大家展开讨论找寻原因，经大家热烈反复辩论，结果明确三点经验：（一）打破秋耕思想障碍，全面组织全半辅助劳力；（二）等价公道合理，超过标准奖励，妇女儿童实行了家庭二八分红；（三）干部亲自动手，深入互助发现问题，及时处理，夺红旗办法使落后组变为模范组。接着讨论布置，开展十天积粪运动，坚决不留一根茬，彻底割掉小尾巴，捆草打豆。彻底场光地净一扫光，妇女沤菜缝衣裳，男人灭荒捎薰灰，并展开节约，总结秋耕选模范，检查耕三余一，结合整财工作。大家一致同意，接受光荣任务，高喊：“今年秋后比粪堆，明年场上比谷堆，不吃糠不能度灾荒，不吃菜粮食吃的快！”（振华、李明、高升、发生）
