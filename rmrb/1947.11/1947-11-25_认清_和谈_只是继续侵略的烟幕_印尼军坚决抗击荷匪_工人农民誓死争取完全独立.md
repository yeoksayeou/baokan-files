　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st—As Dutch-Indonesian negotiations are underway under the auspices of the "mediation" committee of three nations (beginning on the 15th), Dutch aggressors are continuously expanding their offensives against Indonesian liberated areas. According to Indonesian military communiqués on the 17th and 18th, in the Mojokerto region of East Java, Dutch troops launched a new offensive. In the Wilos region of Central Java, Dutch troops, supported by tanks and artillery, repeatedly attacked Indonesian military positions but were repeatedly repelled by Indonesian defenders. Dutch naval forces landed at Tanjung Pinang on the eastern coast of Sumatra, but were forced to retreat after a counterattack by Indonesian forces. A Yogyakarta radio commentary on the Indonesian situation and Dutch-Indonesian negotiations stated: "There is no indication of peace in Indonesia. The Security Council has not stopped Dutch aggression, and the Netherlands has not abandoned its plan to destroy the Indonesian Republic. Dutch imperialists are still playing their insidious game—using peace talks as a smokescreen for continued aggression." The Indonesian Trade Union's newspaper "Worker's Daily" and the Indonesian News Agency pointed out that Indonesian workers and peasants in Dutch-occupied areas refuse to be enslaved by the Netherlands and regard cooperation with the Dutch as treason. The Indonesian Youth Federation (a united organization uniting all sectors of Indonesian youth) and the Indonesian Trade Union issued separate telegrams on the 16th and 19th, expressing to the world's youth and working class that they are determined to be the rearguard of the Indonesian Republic, determined to resist the Dutch fascist bandits, and strive for complete independence, not stopping until their goal is achieved.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th—Batavia dispatch: According to the Indonesian military communiqué on the 16th, the Dutch military's full-scale invasion of Indonesian liberated areas is proceeding frantically. In East Java, in addition to launching a fierce offensive against Garulawan, south of Malang, Dutch troops also concentrated their forces in an attempt to break through the Indonesian military positions in the Batu area. In Central Java, Dutch troops, aided by artillery and air force, re-launched an offensive against the Karanganyar area (note: the Karanganyar area was liberated by the Indonesian army two weeks ago). Indonesian troops are firmly defending their positions and repelled the Dutch aggressors in the Banjarnegara area. In West Java, Dutch troops also harassed from the Cimahi area near Bandung. The military spokesperson of the Indonesian Republic broadcast from Yogyakarta, stating: "The Indonesian army is stepping up its resistance against the enemy on all fronts. The Dutch authorities have ignored the Security Council's resolution on a ceasefire, and the Dutch side should bear full responsibility for all the consequences of the war." President Sukarno issued a statement on the 8th, reiterating his determination to fight to the end and calling on the Indonesian people to "fight for complete independence."

    工人农民誓死争取完全独立
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】值印荷谈判在三国“调停”委员会主持下（开始于十五日）进行之际，荷兰侵略者却不断扩大对印尼解放区的攻势。据印尼军十七、十八日公报称：在东爪哇摩卓格尔部地区荷军发动新攻势，在中爪哇威洛斯地区，荷军配合坦克大炮数次进犯印尼军阵地，但屡次被印尼守军击退，荷兰海军在苏岛东部海岸之丹绒槟朗登陆，经印尼军反击后被迫撤退。日惹广播评论印尼局势及印荷谈判时称：“此间无任何迹象表示印尼将有和平，安理会并未制止荷兰侵略，荷兰亦未放弃摧毁印尼共和国之计谋。荷兰帝国主义者仍在玩弄它们的阴谋把戏——以和谈为继续侵略的烟幕。”印尼职工会机关报“工人日报”及印尼通讯社指出：荷占领区的印尼工人和农民均拒绝为荷兰奴役，他们视与荷兰人合作为叛逆。印尼青年总会（团结印尼各界青年的统一组织）及印尼职工会于十六、十九日先后发表通电，向全世界青年和工人阶级表示：他们誓死为印尼共和国之后盾，决心反抗荷兰法西斯匪徒，争取完全独立，不达目的决不罢休。
    【新华社陕北十九日电】巴达维亚讯：据印尼军十六日公报称：荷军全面进犯印尼解放区之战事，正疯狂进行中。在东爪哇，荷军除向玛琅南都的加鲁拉万发动猛烈攻势外，并集中兵力企图突破巴都区印尼军阵地。在中爪哇，荷军借助于炮兵及空军重新向卡朗阿涅尔区发动进攻（按：卡朗阿涅尔要区系于两周前为印尼军解放者），印尼军固守阵地，并击退巴宁加朗区之荷兰侵略军。在西爪哇，荷军亦自万隆附近的提马希区窜扰。印尼共和国军事发言人自日惹广播称：“印尼军正在各战线上加紧抗击敌人。荷兰当局对安理会停战令之决议置之不理，一切战争后果应由荷方负全责”。苏加诺总统八日发表谈话，重申抗战到底决心，并号召印尼人民“为完全独立而奋斗”。
