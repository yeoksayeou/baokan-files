    Mei Village Record
    My family is from Gaojiazhuang Village, Wanquan, Shanxi. For generations, we have been landlords. My grandfather was known as "Old Eight." Mentioning "Old Eight" made everyone "change color at the sight of a tiger," their hearts filled with fear.
    My father, Zhang Xizhou, was a feudal ruler who combined the roles of landlord, usurer, local tyrant, and merchant. My mother was his accomplice. My entire family, big and small, exploited, abused, and devoured people. There wasn't a good one among us.
    Before the incident, my father was already the owner of a money shop, and also served as the honorary manager of a pawnshop and a silver firm. He also ran hemp shops, flour mills, carpentry shops, etc. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he also acted as an economic traitor in the Japanese-occupied areas, trafficking in opium, gold, and flour... He frequently traveled between Tianjin, Taiyuan, Zhangde, and Shanghai, where the Japanese lived. His capital was over one million yuan. He was also the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, and had close ties with the district and county governments of Wanquan and Quwo. He truly could "move two counties with a stomp of his foot," and had the power to summon wind and rain.
    His main method of exploitation was lending at high interest rates. Very few farmers in Wanquan and Quwo counties (mainly in Quwo) were not exploited by him. The money shop usually employed a dozen or so assistants who specialized in collecting debts. Poor farmers who could not repay their debts were sent to the county in groups every day, imprisoned, and forced to use their land as collateral or have their houses demolished. The wood from the demolished houses was taken to the carpentry shop as raw materials. The money earned was still used to buy houses and lend money. Our family's six or seven hundred mu of land in Quwo (I don't remember the exact number, just an estimate), and over a hundred rooms, were all seized from the farmers in this way.
    In Xiyangli Village, Wanquan, a man named Mengwa was dragged to my house by a debt-collecting lackey. Being forced into a corner, he hanged himself from the beam in the south room of my courtyard. After he died, guess what my mother said? She said, "Hmph! This poor ghost, he's really ungrateful. He can't repay the money, and he still wants to swindle a coffin out of us!" As far as I can remember, my parents trafficked and drove seven poor girls to their deaths.
    There was a maid named Xue'er, who was from a farmer who used her to pay off a debt. After she came to my house, she did all sorts of work, but wasn't given food or clothing, and no bedding at night. On very cold days, she slept alone on a small wooden board, not even allowed to have a mat. She couldn't bear it and ran away. After being caught, my father stripped her naked, hung her from a beam, and beat her with hemp ropes soaked in water until her skin was torn and bloody. After the beating, he sold her to a hired worker as a wife, to curry favor with that worker. But because of the severe mistreatment, the girl died in a few days!
    Another maid, named Ronghua, was bought with money. My mother often said, "Her price was too high, almost as expensive as half a mule. She came to my house and was beaten and mistreated." When she grew to be eighteen or nineteen years old, my father sold her to an old wealthy man in his fifties as a concubine in order to make money. He sold her for over two hundred silver dollars.
    There was also a maid who was the daughter of a very poor Guiwa from Nanjin Village, Wanquan. She was exchanged for two dou of wheat. She started spinning, cooking, operating the bellows, sweeping the yard... as soon as she came to my house at the age of six, working like an adult. But when it came to eating, she wasn't treated like a human being. She was only thrown half a leftover dry bun for each meal. If she wasn't full, my mother would scold, "You dead girl, you were born to beg for food!..." (Her parents were originally beggars)
    My mother would beat her with fire pokers, sticks, and brooms at the slightest provocation. She would beat her until her head was bleeding, and wouldn't even allow her to cry... My younger sister was the same age as the maid. My mother didn't allow the maid to call her by her name, she had to call her "sister." Eating, drinking tea, defecating, urinating, washing her face, washing her feet... she had to serve her in everything. If she didn't serve her well, or called her by her name, my mother would beat her...
    When she first came to my house, her beggar parents would often come to see her. Each time they came, the whole family would hug each other and cry. My mother hated it and wouldn't allow them to meet again. After that, when her mother missed her, she would secretly run to the door of my house and cry...
    The abuse of hired workers is also endless. One hired worker, named Zhujia, was a diligent, capable, honest, and loyal farmer. He specialized in driving my father's cart between Quwo and Wanquan. Over two hundred li, he often drove it in one day, or even one night. And he wasn't allowed to ride in the cart, he had to run alongside it with all his might. Once, he had such severe shortness of breath that he fell ill with a sudden illness and died in an inn halfway. Another old hired worker, Zhang Yiwa, came to my house when he was a teenager and worked until he was in his fifties or sixties. He worked his whole life, neither dead nor alive, and I don't know how much blood and sweat my family squeezed from him! When he got old and couldn't move his legs, my father kicked him out! As far as I can remember, he lived in a broken earthen kiln and was penniless...
    The sins of my parents, my family, are endless! The blood debts owed to the farmers! Cannot be repaid...
    However, growing up in such a family, and being raised on the blood and sweat of the farmers, I never faced up to these sins of my family. When I was at home, I lived the same cannibalistic life as the rest of my family. I spoiled my teeth eating sweets since I was little. These sweets were all gifts "paid as respect" from farmers who couldn't repay their debts; when my mother beat the maid, I stood by and watched the fun... Landlord ideology was rooted in my mind from an early age. The common people were afraid of me and called me "Young Master Zhang." Instead of feeling ashamed of riding on the backs of the people, I felt comfortable...
    After joining the People's Army in 1945, my thoughts and feelings, my family, and the entire landlord class were always inextricably linked. After the land reform movement began, I had many ideological conflicts, "I thought the struggle against the landlords was excessive. I thought that dividing up the things would be enough, why still..."
    When stationed in Anyang Village, Lucheng, the masses struggled against the local tyrant landlord Chen Dehai, and the organization asked us to help. Because I sympathized with Chen Dehai, I not only didn't actively help, but I even stopped other comrades from encouraging the masses to struggle against him.
    Soon, Wanquan and Quwo were really liberated one after another. This should have been such exciting news of victory! But in my heart, it produced fear. I thought uneasily, "This time, my family... my parents..." From then on, the burden on my mind became even greater. I often worried about my family and parents. Every time I saw the masses struggling against the landlords, I became emotional.
    Under the education of the Party, and with the improvement of my class consciousness, and with the improvement of my understanding of land reform, I gradually admitted that "the family should be struggled against," but I still hoped that "it wouldn't be too severe." This kind of emotion, like a poisonous snake, has been entangling me, corroding me, preventing me from getting close to the people quickly, and preventing me from making faster progress! I have always stubbornly stood on the side of the landlord class, sympathizing with them, and thinking for them!
    However, I never thought about: that Mengwa who was forced to hang himself; that Xue'er who was tortured to death; that hired worker Zhujia who was exhausted to death; and the thousands upon thousands of poor farmers in Wanquan and Quwo counties who were forced to death, starved to death, and forced to become separated from their wives and children... I never thought about how great the sins of my parents and my family were, how much blood debt they owed the farmers, and how the farmers should demand repayment. How clear my position was as a landlord, and how obvious my feelings were as a landlord!... These past two days, after listening to some comrades' complaints, and recalling the sins of my own family, I deeply realized that the sins of my parents and my family are too great. I deeply felt that the people are too lenient with me, that the people don't question my sins, but still support me, cultivate me, and give me a bright and great future. How generous is that.
    But what are the people being lenient to me for? What are they supporting me and cultivating me for?...
    Therefore, I want to resolutely betray the landlord class, and my landlord family, and the entire landlord class, sever all ties, gloriously stand on the side of the people, and fight for the complete liberation of the poor farmers, and atone for my sins!
    Some time ago, I wrote a letter to the Wanquan County government and all the villagers of Gao Village. Now, I am writing a letter to the Quwo County government and all the farmers in Quwo County. In addition to accusing my family of various sins to the government and the masses, I also stated my firm stance on the side of the poor farmers, carried out the struggle against my family, and told them about the pot of silver dollars, the pot of copper coins, the two-story underground cave under the mill in the cattle yard, and a secret kiln under the upper-level cave, a secret kiln on the east threshing ground, a secret cave on the roof of the north house in the backyard, and the hayloft of the cattle yard stables... etc., where things were buried, asking them to dig out the things and distribute them to the poor farmers.

    坚决背叛地主立场
    站到人民方面来
    军大张亚同志的反省
    梅村记
    我家在山西万泉高家庄村，人老几辈以来，就是地主。我的祖父，人们称他“老八”。一提起“老八”，人人“谈虎变色”，心惊肉跳。
    我父亲，张希周，是一个地主、高利贷、豪绅、恶霸、商人五位一体的封建统治者。我母亲，便是他的帮凶，我全家大小，都同样剥削人，苛打人、吃人，没一个好家伙。
    事变前，我父亲即当了钱庄老板，兼任着当铺与银号的名誉经理，还经营麻铺、粉房、木匠铺等……抗战中，又在敌占区当经济汉奸，贩卖大烟、金子、料面，……经常来往于日本人住着的平津、太原、彰德、上海之间。资本在一百万元以上。他又当着商会会长，万泉、曲沃的区县政权都有密切连系。真是“一跺脚，两县动”，呼风唤雨全由他。
    他主要的剥削方式，是放高利贷。万泉、曲沃（主要在曲沃）两县农民，没受他剥削的很少很少。钱铺里，通常用十几个伙计，专门四出要帐。还不起帐的穷苦农民，天天成群成群的被送到县上，关进监牢里，强迫他们拿地来顶，或拆去房子。把农民的房子拆掉，把木料拉到木匠铺里作原料，赚下钱仍置房、放帐。我家曲沃的六七百亩地（记不清楚只是大概数），一百多间房子，就是这样从农民手中夺来的。
    万泉西杨李村，一个叫孟娃的，讨帐的狗腿子把他拉到我家后，被逼得没法，吊死在我家中院南屋的梁上。人死了，你猜我母亲说啥？她说：“哼！这个穷鬼，真没良心，还不起钱，还想再讹咱一口棺材哩！”据我能记得的，我父母把穷家女孩，贩卖逼死的，就有七个。
    有一个丫头，叫血儿，是一家农民顶帐过来的。来到我家后，啥活都干，不给吃不给穿，夜间不给他铺盖。很冷的天，一个人躺在一块小木板上，连块席片也不让铺。她受不了，就跑啦，被抓回来后，我父亲把她衣裤脱光，吊在梁上，用水浸麻绳，打的皮开肉烂。打后，又把她卖给一个雇工作老婆，来笼络那个雇工的心。可是因折磨太很，没过几天，这个丫头就死去了！……。
    另一个丫头，叫荣花是掏钱买的。母亲常说：“她的价钱太贵了，快抵半头骡子贵了。她到我家，挨打受气。长到十八九岁，父亲为了赚钱，把她卖给当地一个五十多岁的老财主做小老婆。卖了二百多块现大洋。
    还有一个丫头，是万泉南景村的一个赤贫贵娃的女儿。二斗麦子换来的。她六岁到我家，就开始纺花、烧火、拉风箱、扫院扫地……顶一个大人使唤她。可是吃饭的时候，却不把她当成人。一顿只扔给她半块吃剩下的干馍。她吃不饱，我母亲就骂：“你这死丫头，天生就讨饭的！……”（她父母原来讨饭）
    我母亲动不动就拿火柱棍棒条帚把打她。打的头破血流，还不准哭……。我父亲吸大烟，夜间吸到深夜。每次，都叫她跪在旁边捶捶腿，捶的不舒服了就打。每天早上，我们都起的很晚。天不明就叫她起来，去叫雇工们上地。天乌黑，雇工们住在牛院，离我们住内宅，还有一段路。小丫头，一个人，不敢去，一听见叫她，就愁的呜呜哭。她一哭，母亲就起来打……。我的小妹子，和小丫头同岁。母亲不准小丫头唤她名字，一定得称呼“姐姐”，吃饭、喝茶、拉屎、拉尿、洗脸、洗脚……都得侍候她。侍候的不好，或叫她名字，母亲就打……。
    她刚到我家时，她的讨饭爹娘，还常来瞧瞧她，每次来，一家人都抱住大哭一场。我母亲讨厌了，再不准她们见面。以后，她母亲想她了，就偷偷跑到我家门口哭一场……。
    对雇工的虐待，也是说不尽的。一个雇工，叫竹家，是一个又勤快又能干又老诚忠厚的农民。专门给我父亲赶车，来往于曲沃万泉之间。二百多里路，往往一天赶到，甚至一夜赶到。又不得坐车，人随车拼命的跑。有一次，因气喘过于激烈，得下急症，死在半路的店里。另一个老雇工，张义娃，十几岁就到我家，一直干到五六十岁。没死没活的干了一辈子，血汗被我家榨去的不知有多少！到老了，两腿不能动弹了，我父亲就一脚把他踢开！从我记得事起，他就住在一个破土窑里，是个穷光蛋。……
    我的父母，我的家庭的罪恶，是说不完的！所欠农民的血债！是偿还不清的。……
    但是，生长在这样的家庭里，用农民血汗养育长大的我，从来，没有正视过家庭这些罪恶。我在家的时候，和全家一样地过着吃人的生活。从小吃糖吃坏了牙，这些糖都是还不起帐的农民“孝敬”来的礼物；母亲打丫头，我站在旁边看热闹……地主思想，从小就扎根在我的脑子里。老百姓害怕我，称我“张少爷”，我不但不觉得骑在人民头上可耻，反感觉舒服……。
    四五年，参加人民军队后，思想感情，和家庭，和整个地主阶级，一直是千丝万缕，分割不开。土改运动开始后，我在思想上产生许多抵触，“对斗争地主认为斗争过火。心想，把东西分了就算啦，为啥还……”。
    在潞城安阳村驻时，群众斗争恶霸地主陈德海，组织上叫我们去帮助。我因为同情陈德海，不但没积极帮助，当别的同志鼓动群众斗时，我还拦阻他。
    不久，万泉曲沃真的都相继解放了，这应该是多么令人兴奋的胜利消息啊！但是，在我心里，却产生了恐惧。我不安地想：“这一下，我的家……我的父母……”从此，思想上背的包袱更大。时常顾虑家庭，父母。每次看见群众斗争地主，就产生情绪波动——
    在党的教育下，跟着自己阶级觉悟的提高，跟着自己对土改认识的提高，逐渐也承认“家庭应该被斗争”了，但仍希望“不要斗得太厉害”，这样的感情，象一条毒蛇，一直在缠绕着我，腐蚀着我，使我不能很快地靠近人民，不能更快的进步！我总是这样固执地站在地主阶级的立场上，同情他们，为他们着想！
    但是，我从没有想到过：那被逼上吊的孟娃；那被折磨而死的血儿；那被累而死的雇工竹家；以及万泉曲沃两县成千成万被逼死，被饿死，被逼得妻离子散的贫苦农民……。我从没有想到过，我的父母，我的家庭，有多么大的罪恶，他们欠下农民的血债，农民应该怎么样来索还，我的立场，是多么明确的地主立场啊！我的感情，是多么明显的地主感情啊！……这两天，听了一些同志的诉苦，又回忆了自己家庭的罪恶，使我深深体会到，我的父母，我的家庭的罪恶是太大了。我深深感觉到，人民对我太宽大，人民不过问我的罪恶，还养活我，培育我，给我以光明伟大的前途，这够多么宽大啊。
    但是，人民宽大我是为了什么？养活我，培养我是为了什么？……
    所以，我要坚决背叛地主阶级，和地主家庭，和整个地主阶级，斩断一切连系，光荣地站在人民方面，为贫苦农民的彻底翻身，而奋斗，而立功赎罪！
    前些时，我给万泉县政府及高庄全体乡亲们写过一信，现在，又给曲沃县政府，及曲沃全县农民写去一信。我除向政府，向群众控诉了我家庭的种种罪恶外，还表明了我坚定站在贫苦农民的立场，执行斗争我的家庭，并把我所知道的菜园里埋的一罐银元，一罐铜元，牛院磨坊下的两层地洞，及上层地洞下面的一个孔暗窑，东头打麦场上的一孔暗窑，后院北屋前面窑顶上的一个暗洞，及牛院马房的草楼……等，埋东西的地方都告诉给政府及群众，请他们把东西刨出来，分给贫苦农民。
