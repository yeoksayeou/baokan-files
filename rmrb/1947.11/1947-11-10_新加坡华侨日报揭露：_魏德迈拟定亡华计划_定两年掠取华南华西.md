Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 7th: According to an Associated Press dispatch from Singapore, the local "Overseas Chinese Daily" revealed on the 4th that its reporter in Peiping (Beiping) obtained authoritative information: After the bloodthirsty butcher Wedemeyer came to China for "investigation," the report he took back to Washington regarding aid to Chiang Kai-shek and the destruction of China included a two-year plan to invade South and West China. The plan stipulates: First, U.S. funds, centered in Guangzhou, will be used to "develop" the economy of Guangdong and South China, controlling and plundering South China's industry and agriculture, and using it to support Chiang Kai-shek's anti-people civil war. Second, the ports of Taiwan and South China will be repaired to make them military bases convenient for the U.S. to use for maritime and aerial operations. It is also planned to build highways and railways from Guangzhou to Xiamen to facilitate transportation between Taiwan and Guangdong. The newspaper stated that large quantities of U.S. weapons have already been shipped to Taiwan, ready for Chiang Kai-shek's use. Third, Wedemeyer also plans to build a railway from Guangzhou directly to Lanzhou and Dihua (Ürümqi) on the Asian continent (i.e., the long-planned Marshall's railway) to link U.S. plans to invade West China and South China. It is claimed that the purpose is to use the manpower and resources of South China, supported by the U.S., to "clear the Communists out of North China and Manchuria" in two years. Therefore, to ensure the security of the U.S. in implementing this "invasion plan," Wedemeyer suggests that the area between 30 and 35 degrees north latitude (i.e., north of Wuhan and Hangzhou, south of Kaifeng and Xi'an) be designated as an "absolute military zone," which "must be defended at all costs." The area between 35 and 40 degrees north latitude (i.e., north of Kaifeng and Xi'an, south of Beiping and Datong) is an area that "should be defended as long as possible." As for the military operations in North China and Northeast China north of 40 degrees north latitude (i.e., north of the Beiping and Datong line), during the two years of the "economic plan" implemented in South China, they "will be limited to delaying actions," and "will be abandoned" when it is impossible to defend them.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 6th: According to the "Tianjin Republic Daily" of October 26th, after the American running dog Soong Tzu-wen (T.V. Soong) took charge of Guangdong, in order to adapt to the military and economic interests of his American masters in South China, he has particularly strengthened the military and economic control of Hainan Island. Soong has decided to establish a "Supervisory Office for Industry" on the island, appointing his former private secretary Lu Wenlan as the director. In addition, Chiang Kai-shek's naval lieutenant general Chen Chou-shuo will serve as the pacification director of the island, responsible for the island's military affairs.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 7th: U.S. reactionary Congressman Judd, who was sent to China for "inspection," flew from Korea to Peiping on October 24th. After visiting Nanjing and Shanghai, he flew from Nanjing to Shanghai via Tokyo on the 5th of this month to return to the United States. Before arriving in China, Judd stayed in Tokyo for four days to meet with MacArthur. In Nanjing, he had a direct "meeting" with the bandit Chiang Kai-shek. When he first arrived in Peiping, he claimed that his task was to "study the Chinese situation" based on the recent military, economic, and political "developments" in order to "supplement the Wedemeyer report." During his stay in China, he did not hide his face as an invader. He said that "China is one of the largest markets in the world" and that the United States will quickly solve the "difficulties" encountered by Chiang Kai-shek in the anti-people civil war with the plans jointly formulated by the (U.S.-Chiang) governments. At a Nanjing press conference one day, he openly promoted fascist theories, telling Chiang Kai-shek to deceive the Chinese people with "lies" to cover up the U.S. invasion of China and the crimes of aiding Chiang Kai-shek, saying: "Mussolini once said that if a lie is repeated sufficiently, the people will believe it," saying that this kind of "lie" propaganda is "a great weapon in the world we (referring to Judd and his ilk) live in."

    新加坡华侨日报揭露：
    魏德迈拟定亡华计划
    定两年掠取华南华西
    【新华社陕北七日电】据美联社新加坡消息，此间“华侨日报”四日揭露该报驻北平记者所获权威消息：血腥屠夫魏德迈来华“调查”后携回华盛顿的援蒋亡华报告中，曾拟定一侵略华南华西的两年计划。该计划规定：第一、美国资金以广州为中心，从事“开发”广东与华南经济，控制和掠夺华南工农业。并用以支持蒋介石反人民内战。第二、修建台湾与华南的各港口，使之成为便于美国使用的军事基地，用以从事海上和空中作战。并计划修筑广州到厦门的公路与铁路，使台湾与广东之间获得便利的交通。该报称：大量美国武器业已运抵台湾，准备供蒋介石使用。第三、魏德迈且计划建立一条由广州直达兰州与迪化的亚洲大陆铁路（按即酝酿已久的马歇尔的铁路），以便将美国侵略华西与侵略华南的计划联系起来，据称，其目的是企图以美国扶植下华南的人力物力，在二年后将“共产党清除出华北与满洲”。因此为保障美国实施此种“侵略计划的安全，魏德迈对目前军事形势，建议北纬卅度到卅五度间（即武汉，杭州以北，开封西安以南）地区为“绝对军事区”，“必须以一切代价予以防守”。北纬三十五度到四十度间（即开封西安以北，北平大同以南）地区为“应尽可能长久地予以防守”的地区。而北纬四十度（即北平大同一线以北）的华北与东北地区的军事行动，在华南实行“经济计划”的两年中则“将仅限于拖延行动”，不可能防守时“则予以放弃”。
    【新华社陕北六日电】据十月二十六日天津民国日报载：美国走狗宋子文主粤后，为适应其美国主子在华南军事及经济利益，特别加强对海南岛军事和经济之控制。宋已决定在该岛设立“实业督办公署”，委其原私人秘书陆文澜担任督办。另以蒋匪海军中将陈筹硕担任该岛绥靖主任，负责该岛军事责任。
    【新华社陕北七日电】奉派来华“考察”之美反动众议员周以德（楚德），于十月二十四日由朝鲜飞抵北平，经访问南京、上海后，已于本月五日自宁飞沪取道东京飞返美国。周在抵华前，曾在东京停留四日与麦克阿瑟会商。在南京时曾与蒋贼直接“晤谈”。彼初抵北平时曾宣称，彼此来任务系根据最近军事、经济、政治“发展”，“研究中国情势”，以“补充魏德迈报告。”彼在华期间，毫不掩饰其侵华面目的。说什么“中国是世界最大市场之一”，说美国将于（美蒋）两国政府联合或合作拟定之计划，迅速从事解决蒋介石在反人民内战中所遭遇之“困难”。彼于一日南京记者招待会中，公开宣扬法西斯理论，要蒋介石以“谎言”欺骗中国人民，掩饰美国侵华援蒋罪恶，说：“莫索里尼曾说过，谎言如果充分的予以重复，人民就会相信”，说此种“谎言”宣传就是“我们（指楚德一流）生存的世界上的伟大武器。”
