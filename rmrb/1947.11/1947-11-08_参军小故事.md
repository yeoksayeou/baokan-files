"Seven-Eight Jin" Labors to Welcome the Troops

On September 30th, the weather was clear, and new soldiers sent by various districts gathered in Gusaicun in batches. "Seven-Eight Jin," the cook, worked extra hard that day. He watched as he carried water, sizing up each new soldier who passed by him, and couldn't help but smile. "Such a big lad, no problem carrying a machine gun…" After pouring the water into the water tank, he hurried to help steam buns in the kitchen. People were curious why "Seven-Eight Jin" was so active and positive. This tenant farmer from Xialihou Village, "Seven-Eight Jin," though silent, was smiling to himself, thinking: "Heroes come from among the young, with these lads in the army, what's there to fear in not winning battles?" With this thought, his energy soared, doing this and that, completely forgetting fatigue. Steaming hot buns emerged from the steamer one cage after another. "Comrade! Too big, make them smaller!" "Seven-Eight Jin" happily gestured and suggested for the next batch to be smaller.

In the afternoon, forty young men from Huamadi Administrative Village who had joined the army sat down for a feast, everyone praising and cheering. "Seven-Eight Jin" was taking buns out of the steamer, bare-armed. He glanced out the window and saw the soldiers at the table, each with a sturdy waist and ape-like arms, and couldn't help but shout, "Good soldiers, good soldiers!" After putting the steamer on the ground, he took out a newly issued pair of shoes and sold them for two thousand five hundred yuan, which he used to buy twelve large boxes of cigarettes. Then, at the banquet, he distributed cigarettes, eight to one table, seven to another. Comrades tried to stop him, but he stopped them saying with a flushed face and excitement, "A small gift carries a big meaning, how can you look down on me, tenant farmer Seven-Eight Jin?" He waited until the new soldiers were full of food and drink, and finally, when they put the cigarettes he gave them one by one in their mouths, he smiled "meiqi" (meaning happy).

Song Erbao Steps Forward as a Hero

Song Erbao is a seventeen-year-old tenant farmer who joined the famous Qin Shichang Combat Team on September 18th. Deputy Squad Leader Jia Hanwen handed him a new "Xiangning Made" type 65 rifle taken from the hands of Yan’s bandits. Erbao happily pushed bullets into the chamber one by one, then repeatedly ejected them, and Erbao couldn't help but smile with satisfaction.

He couldn't remember how many days had passed, when suddenly there were several gunshots. Qin Shichang's team went to investigate and found that twenty or so Yan bandits from "Sanjia Township" were robbing autumn crops in Caoma Village. The team members were excited and eager to fight immediately. Captain Qin said, "Prepare!" but didn't plan to let Erbao go. However, Erbao stood stubbornly in the ranks of those departing. Captain Qin led the team to ambush in the large ditch north of the fort in Caoma Village, and sent two other team members to open fire south of the fort. They fired two shots, and the Yan bandits fled north desperately. As they entered the ambush circle, machine guns, rifles, and hand grenades immediately rang out. The brave team members also charged forward with bayonets. Song Erbao, going into battle for the first time, also rushed forward. After chasing for a short distance, one fellow suddenly slipped and fell into the ditch, his rifle falling four or five feet away. Erbao rushed forward, grabbed the gun, pointed the muzzle at the chest of the Yan bandit who had been preparing, and thus captured a prisoner. (Taiyue Branch)

    “七八斤”筵前劳军
    九月三十号，天气晴朗，由各区欢送来的新战士一批批陆续都集聚到古赛村。炊事员“七八斤”，这天工作得格外起劲，他一边挑水一边观望，打量着每个从自己身旁闪过去的新战士们，他由不得笑了。“好大个的后生，扛机枪是没话说……”，他把水倒在水缸里后，赶忙又帮忙去火房蒸馒头了。人们都很奇怪，为人么“七八斤”特别活跃积极呢？这个下李后村的佃户“七八斤”，口虽不作声，心里却笑迷迷的在想：“英雄出少年，部队里有这批后生们，还怕不打胜仗吗？”这么着一想，不由得他的劲头便上来了，作这个做那个，根本忘掉了疲倦，一笼笼热气腾腾的馒头蒸出来了。“同志！脸色大了，再小点子吧？！”“七八斤”开心地指划着，并提出蒸下一笼的意见来。
    下午花马地行政村四十位参军青年就筵，人人夸奖个个叫好，“七八斤”这时正赤臂起笼，猛向窗外一望，果见这批入席战士，一个个虎腰猿臂，不禁大声喝彩，“好战士，好战士！”把蒸笼端到地下后，他抽空将新发下来的一双鞋，卖了两千五百块钱，就买成十二大盒纸烟，于是他在酒席筵前，这一桌八支，那一桌七支的散起纸烟来。同志们拦挡也拦挡不住，他通红着脸激奋地说：“礼轻人意重，怎么看不起我佃户七八斤？”他一直等的新战士们个个酒醉饭饱，最后把他送的纸烟一支支送到嘴里边时才“美气”（欢喜的意思）的笑了。
    宋二保出手当英雄
    宋二保是十七岁的佃户，九月十八日刚参加了著名的秦世昌战斗队，副班长贾汉文顺手递给他一支新从阎匪手里夺来的“乡宁造”六五枪，二保高兴的将子弹一粒一粒推进膛里，又忽察忽察地退出来，不由二保眉头一飞就裂着嘴笑起来。
    已记不清过了几天，忽然传来了几声枪响，秦世昌的队伍便找着去听，原来“三佳乡村”二十来个阎匪，到曹马村抢割秋庄稼，队员们兴奋了，恨不得马上就干，秦队长就说准备！但并不计划让二保去，可是二保睹着嘴，硬站在出发的行列里。秦队长把队伍拉到曹麻村大堡子北面大水渠里埋伏起来，另派两个队员到堡子南面开火，砰砰打了两枪，阎匪便没命的向北逃跑。走进了伏击圈，机枪、步枪、手榴弹立刻响起来，英勇的队员又端着带刺刀的步枪追去，初次临阵的宋二保也杀奔前去，追不多远，一个家伙猛然一滑栽到在水渠里，步枪摔了四五尺远，二保抢前一步拿过枪来，把枪口对准备了阎匪的胸膛，就此捉了个俘虏。（太岳分社）
