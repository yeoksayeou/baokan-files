    Xiuwu Third District Rotating Combat Team
    Actively Attacks to Cover Harvesting and Planting
    [This newspaper, Taihang, 8th dispatch] The Xiuwu Third District Rotating Combat Team, approaching the enemy stronghold of Daiwang Town on the outskirts of Jiaozuo on the Daoqing Road, has achieved great success in covering the masses to rush harvest and planting. In the three days from the 27th to the 29th of last month, it covered the masses to rush harvest 21,515 mu, eliminate wasteland and plant wheat 17,178 mu, and captured 11 enemy soldiers of the 38th Division, traitors, bullies, and secret agents, seized 4 war horses, and 2 bicycles. On the night of the 28th, the rotating combat team went to the enemy's Daiwang stronghold and fired fiercely into the village with machine guns and grenade launchers. The enemy, hearing the gunfire, panicked and huddled in bunkers, not daring to return fire. At dawn on the 29th, a squad of the rotating combat team went deep into the Jiaozuo-Xiuwu highway to operate. They encountered the enemy's 38th Division forcing civilians to repair the road. The enemy, upon discovering them, asked, "Which unit are you from?" Squad leader Zhang Heitou cleverly replied, "Don't misunderstand, we are the Baiting Township Militia." Then two plainclothes men came out of Jiaozuo, riding bicycles to Xiuwu. We immediately accompanied them, and when we reached a fork in the road, the rotating combat team gave a signal, and all guns were pointed at the plainclothes men, saying: "Do you still recognize your Eighth Route Army grandfathers? Go!" Without firing a shot, the two plainclothes men and their two bicycles were taken prisoner.
    [This newspaper] Huolu extensively launched political offensives against the enemy, covering the masses to plant wheat. The militia of Wujiazhuang in the Second District, covering the masses to plant wheat, launched a sudden attack for two days, completing two-thirds of the village's wheat fields. On the 14th, the militia of the five villages of Quan Shang supported Wujiazhuang and Hejigou in planting more than two qing of wheat. The masses happily said: "The rear supports us, and we plant wheat in the front. We must take good care of the sentry post for the rear!" The headquarters is promoting this experience, seizing the time, and covering the masses to plant wheat quickly. The masses of Sanzhai in the Second District, cut the millet and put it in the fields and on the threshing grounds, striving to plant wheat first and then thresh the grain. The masses' automatic digging of cave dwellings to hide grain has become a widespread mass action, combining wheat planting and grain storage, not letting the enemy seize a single grain, and striving to plant wheat.
