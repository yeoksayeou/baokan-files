	People from Hebei, Shandong, and Henan Provinces Support the Great Counteroffensive
	Practice Thrift, Donate Funds, and Cherish the Wounded
	[This dispatch is from our newspaper's Hebei, Shandong, and Henan office on the 31st] Since the Great Counteroffensive, people from all walks of life in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan have enthusiastically supported the front lines. Government offices and schools have been practicing thrift, donating funds and grain; the masses have been actively providing stretchers, comforting the wounded, making counteroffensive shoes, and grinding counteroffensive flour to ensure supplies for the front lines.
	(1) Practicing Thrift and Donating Funds: At a joint meeting of teachers in the sixth district of Puyang County, 52 teachers voluntarily practiced thrift and donated 3,160 catties of rice. They proposed to continue practicing thrift on a large scale, guaranteeing that each person would save 20 catties of rice per month until Chiang Kai-shek was defeated. The Bianqu No. 2 Middle School organized a transportation team business group on the 15th of this month. All teachers, staff, students, and miscellaneous personnel participated in pushing salt carts to earn money to solve their cotton clothing problems. Only seven teams of nine small carts earned 350,000 yuan in less than half a month, solving the cotton clothing problem. The Kunwu exchange markets donated 600,000 yuan. Postal workers in various places also actively donated funds and saved money, saving the public more than 300,000 yuan.
	(2) To Cooperate with the Great Counteroffensive, People in Various Places Actively Provide Stretchers: On the 3rd of this month, 600 stretchers and more than 4,000 people from Nanle County's Sixth District were dispatched. The stretcher bearers and civilians were all full of spirit and determined to "resolutely complete the stretcher mission to defeat Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible." The district cadres of the fifth district initially felt that the task of 110 stretchers would be difficult, but it was resolved after discussion with the masses. For example, Zhang Zenghan from Qianzhao Village said, "It is okay not to go home for two years, and it is an honor to sacrifice at the front." None of the 30 stretcher bearers accompanying the army in the sixth district of Hua County deserted in 53 days. They advanced in the rain during the battle of Dingtao, carrying an average of three to five wounded soldiers per stretcher overnight. During the day, they also helped the local people with their work during breaks.
	(3) Liberated Masses Console the Wounded: People in various places care for the wounded soldiers as if they were their own relatives. On the 16th day of the eighth lunar month, when the wounded passed through Luozhuang Village in the third district of Puyang County, the people of each village automatically donated money and brought chicken, pork, and other items to console them. Jiang Chaoying, a representative of the Shilou Farmers' Association, said, "You were wounded for us, defeated Chiang Kai-shek's attack, and protected our homes and fruits. We really can't repay you." Li Nuyun, a representative of the Women's Association, said, "If the clothes and other things of the wounded comrades are dirty, let our Women's Association wash them." The fifth district of Kaocheng County is a guerrilla area, and the people of each village take very good care of the wounded of our field army. When the wounded live in their villages, they automatically take good care of them. The mother of Yunxiang from Hou [missing character] Village took care of a seriously wounded soldier who lived in her house very patiently, boiling soup every now and then and feeding the wounded soldier one spoonful at a time. Because the people of Shao Village took good care of the wounded, the grateful wounded soldiers shed tears and said, "You are really worried about us, we will never forget you!"
	(4) In Order to Ensure Supplies for the Front, the People in Various Places Hasten to Make Cotton Clothes, Grind Flour, Hull Rice, and Make Counteroffensive Shoes to Supply the Front: For example, all 54 women in Zhaolou Village, Nanjun Fourth District, who could work, could not make military uniforms. Therefore, the chairman of the Women's Federation personally went to other villages to learn and then taught the women in the whole village. She kept saying to everyone, "We must do it well, we must be worthy of the comrades who shed blood in the front. They are fighting the enemy every day, and they only have one set of cotton clothes in the winter. If we don't do it well, we really can't bear it." Under her leadership, 200 sets of cotton clothes were completed in three days. After receiving the notice from the district, each village in Linze First District quickly prepared counteroffensive shoes and cloth and sent them to the village office. The people of Miaokou in the second district of Shou Zhang originally planned to grind military flour the next day, but when they heard the news of the Great Counteroffensive, each family started grinding in the middle of the night. From midnight to dawn, they ground 1,400 catties of wheat, and as soon as the sun came out, they sent it to the village office.

    冀鲁豫各界支援大反攻
    节约献金爱护伤员
    【本报冀鲁豫卅一日电】大反攻以来，冀鲁豫各地机关、学校及广大群众，热烈支援前线。各机关学校纷纷节约，献金献粮；群众积极出担架、慰问伤员、作反攻鞋、磨反攻面，保证前线供给。
    （一）节约献金：濮县六区一个教员联席会上，五十二个教员自动节约献米三千一百六十斤，并提出以后要大量节约，保证每人每月节约米二十斤，啥时打倒老蒋啥时算完。边区第二中学，于本月十五号组织了运输队营业股，全体教、职、学、杂人员都参加推盐劳动，赚钱解决自己的棉衣问题，仅七级九辆小车，不到半月就赚三十五万元，棉衣问题解决了。昆吾各集交易所，献金六十万元。各地邮政员工，也积极献金、节约积蓄给公家省出了三十余万元。
    （二）配合大反攻，各地群众积极出担架：本月三日南乐六百付担架、四千多人齐出动，担架民夫个个精神饱满，都坚决表示：“为早日打倒蒋贼，要坚决完成担架任务。”五区一百一十付担架的任务，区干先感觉作难，但经群众一讨论，解决了。如前赵庄张增韩说：“干二年不回家也中，牺牲到前方，也是光荣的。”滑县六区三十付随军担架，五十三天中没有一个逃亡的，打定陶时冒雨前进，一夜中平均每付担架运三个至五个伤员，白天休息中还帮助驻地群众作活。
    （三）翻身群众纷纷慰劳伤员：各地群众对作战负伤战士爱护如自己的亲人。旧历八月十六日，伤员路过濮县三区罗庄集时，各村群众自动募捐，带着鸡子、猪肉等前去慰问。史楼农会代表蒋朝英说：“你们为俺负了伤，打败了蒋贼的进攻，保住俺的家和果实，我们实无法报答。”妇会代表李努云说：“伤员同志的衣服和其他东西，脏了叫我们妇会洗洗。”考城五区是游击区，各村群众对我野战军的伤员非常爱护，伤员住到他们村上，他们都自动照顾的很好。后×庄×云祥的母亲，他家住的一个较重的伤员，她很耐心的侍候，一会烧一回汤，用小杓一下一下的喂伤员。邵庄群众因照顾伤员好，感激的伤员流下泪说：“你们对俺真是操心，无论如何是不会忘了你们的！”
    （四）为保证前方供给，各地群众赶做棉衣、磨面、碾米、做反攻鞋，供给前方：如南峰四区赵楼全村五十四名能做活的妇女，都不会做军衣，因此妇会长亲自到外村学，再教全村妇女。她不断向大家说：“咱们要好好做，要对得起前方打仗流血的同志们，他们每天与敌人拼命，一个冬天只有一身棉衣，如做不好，咱真下不去。”在她领导下，三天即完成了二百套棉衣。临泽一区各村接到区里的通知后，就迅速准备好反攻鞋和布，送到村公所。寿张二区苗口群众，原来准备第二天磨军面，听说大反攻的消息，半夜各家都磨起来了，从半夜到天明，就磨了一千四百斤麦，太阳一出，都送到村公所了。
