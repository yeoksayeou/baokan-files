[This article was transmitted by the Taihang News Agency on the 14th.] Belated news: Since our army's victory at Qingfengdian, the communication lines between Shimen and Yuanshi, controlled by Chiang bandit forces, have been cut off again by our army. Wei Yonghe, the puppet traitor holed up in the isolated city of Yuanshi, was attacked three times on the 3rd of this month by the Gaoyi Independent Battalion and militia working teams besieging Yuanshi, resulting in the annihilation of over 50 enemy soldiers. On the morning of the 3rd, two enemy companies attempted to loot the Miaozhuang area but were met with a fierce assault by the Gaoyi Independent Battalion's ambush forces. The enemy fled back into the city with their tails between their legs, and we killed over 20 enemy soldiers. Another group went to Duzhuang, north of the city, to seize grain but was severely struck by a unit of our Central Hebei forces, resulting in the annihilation of over 30 enemy soldiers. The enemy is increasingly terrified and uneasy. In addition to withdrawing their stronghold in Chichi Village, north of the city, back into the city on the night of the 4th, they are also wantonly conscripting men, seizing grain, and cutting down trees in the suburbs in an attempt to hold out. Inside the city, they are even more frantically seizing civilian laborers to rush repairs on fortifications to defend against our attack. Currently, within Yuanshi territory, with the exception of the isolated city of Yuanshi, the entire area has been liberated. The broad masses of people have once again seen the light of day and are enthusiastically supporting the army to completely annihilate the Chiang puppet troops guarding the city.
[This article was transmitted by Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, on the 22nd.] During the Baoding North and Qingfengdian campaigns, 20,000 civilian laborers from Central Hebei fought on the front lines, producing a large number of model heroes. In Hejian, Anguo, Dacheng, and Renqiu counties alone, 198 support-the-front model heroes emerged. The "Liuchang" platoon of Anguo had all nine stretchers remain intact, rushing to the front lines during a continuous forced march of two days and one night to bravely rescue the wounded, even using their own rice bowls to collect the urine of the wounded. During the seven days, they seized every moment between battles to gather over 1,400 catties of firewood and earned over 100,000 yuan, all of which was used to comfort the wounded. Model stretcher-bearer Li Jilin, although already 55 years old, voluntarily requested to go to the front lines. He never fell behind during the 140-li forced march and even helped two people carry their belongings. Xue Zhenjie and Jiao Huanqin of the Dacheng stretcher third squad, under enemy fire from both sides, encouraged the morale of the laborers and directed the stretchers without chaos, making three round trips to the front lines. Wang Anqin and others of the second squad, after making five round trips to the front lines to rescue the wounded, led their entire squad to dig fortifications all night long.

    【新华社晋察冀二十二日电】保北与清风店战役中，冀中两万民工转战前线，涌现大批模范功臣。仅河间、安国、大城、任邱等四县，即涌现出一百九十八个支前功臣。安国“流昌”排九付担架无一逃亡，在两天一夜连续急行军中赶赴前线，勇敢抢救伤员，并用自己的饭碗给伤员接尿。七天中抓紧战斗间隙，打柴一千四百余斤，赚钱十余万元，全部慰劳伤员。模范担架队员李济林，虽年已五十五岁，但自动要求上前线，在一百四十里急行军中，始终未掉队，还帮助两个人背东西。大城担架三中队薛振洁、焦唤勤在被敌两面夹击的情况下，鼓励民工情绪，指挥担架不乱。一连往返火线三次。二中队王安勤等于往返火线五次抢救伤员后，又带领全班挖了一夜工事。
