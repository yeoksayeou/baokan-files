Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. According to a Reuters report from Paris: L'Humanité published a lengthy statement by French Communist Party General Secretary Thorez on the 31st of last month, declaring that the recent municipal election results indicated "the consolidation of the working class and democratic forces, and that the Communist Party remains the largest party in France." Thorez said: "Our party has every right to be proud and look forward to the future with confidence. Because despite the fierce anti-communist propaganda directed by de Gaulle, and the anti-communist platform of all other parties, from the Socialist Party to the most despicable reactionaries; and despite the arbitrary election law that disadvantages us, allowing the Socialist Party and the Gaullists to collude in appointing municipal organs; a third of French men and women have still affirmed their unwavering reliance on our party." Although the final results of the municipal elections have not yet been published, Thorez cited existing official figures, stating: "These figures accurately acknowledge that we remain the largest party. In towns with over nine thousand inhabitants, the distribution of elected seats is as follows:

    Communist Party – 3993 seats (or 30.64 percent)
    Rally of the French People – 3762 seats (or 28.86 percent)
    Socialist Party – 2107 seats (or 21.12 percent)
    Popular Republican Movement – 1682 seats (or 12.91 percent)

Regarding the French Communist Party's future activities, Thorez stated: "We must bring ourselves closer to the masses, and we may find new forms of unity and action for the broad masses of the people. In various factories, union workers have established committees to defend the republic; and it is possible to establish such committees in various regions, uniting all republicans, communists, Catholics, socialists, and free thinkers to deal with the fascist danger." (Xinhua News Agency note: According to an AFP report from the 29th, during a debate in the French Parliament, a spokesperson for the French Communist Party declared: "Neither the current government nor the parliament can lead the republic against the fascist camp composed of de Gaulle's Rally of the French People, the Socialist Party, and the current government; only workers' and peasants' committees can lead this struggle, and such committees will soon be established in various regions.")

    多列士发表声明宣称：
    法共仍为第一大党
    今后将更加强联系群众
    【新华社陕北三日电】据路透社巴黎讯：人道报上月三十一日发表法共总书记多列士长篇声明，宣称：最近市选结果，表示了“工人阶级与民主力量的巩固与共产党仍属法国第一大党”。多列士说：“我们的党有一切权力足以自豪，瞻望前途，充满了信心。因为尽管戴高乐所指使进行的猛烈反共宣传，以及一切其他政党，从社会党到最卑劣的反动派都把反共敖政纲；又尽管不利于我们的专断的选举法，使社会党与戴高乐派在任命市政机关时得以狼狈为奸；可是法国三分之一的男女，仍旧确定了他们对我党不可动摇的依托。”虽然市选最后结果尚未发表，多列士引据现有的官方数字称：“方数字确切地承认了我们仍然是第一大党。在九千人以上的市镇中，当选议席的分配如下：
    共产党——三九九三席（或百分之三十点六四）
    法国人民联盟——三七六二席（或百分之二十八点八六）
    社会党——二一○七（或百分之二十一点一二）
    人民共和党——一六八二席（或百分之一二点九一）
    多列士论及法共将来活动的计划时称：”我们必须使我们自己更接近群众，我们可能找到广大人民群众团结与行动的新形式。在巴各工厂中，工会的工人已成立了保卫共和国委员会；而在各地建立这种委员会，团结一切共和主义者、共产党人、天主教徒、社会党人及自由思想才，以对付法西斯危险，也都是可能的。“（新华社按：据法新社二十九日电，法议会辩论时，法共发言人曾宣称：“不论现政府或议会都不能领导共和国反对由戴高乐的法国人民联盟、社会党、现政府组成的法西斯阵营；能领导这一斗争的，唯有工农委员会，此种委员会即将于各地成立。”）
