　　Qinghe Fourth District
    Poor Peasants Lead Mutual Aid for Consolidation
    [Report from Jinnan by our newspaper on the 22nd] In villages such as Mazhuang in Qinghe Fourth District, poor peasants are leading production, resolving difficulties during the autumn harvest, and organizing unprecedentedly consolidated mutual aid. The district has initially established a backbone of poor peasants. During production, the masses felt a lack of tools and livestock. Therefore, in wheat planting, poor peasants were used as the backbone to organize mutual aid on a large scale. A total of 595 groups were organized in the district, involving 5,218 people; mutual aid was used to plant 190.12 hectares of wheat. Poor peasants who lacked wheat seeds were lent wheat from the fruits of the harvest. Twenty-one villages lent out 9,996 catties of wheat; in addition, 19,588 catties of beans were lent out. Labor exchange was also implemented during wheat planting. After the wheat planting was completed, these mutual aid groups did not collapse, and it was decided to continue mutual aid in the long term; some have already moved into sideline occupations. For example, Mazhuang opened a dyeing workshop, Huangtaitou opened a cigarette shop, Ningtaitou opened a flour mill, and Zhaotaitou opened a steamed bun shop. Everyone unanimously felt that: "When poor peasants are in charge, everything can be victorious, and everything is easy to handle." In the past, it was difficult to organize mutual aid groups, but because a backbone of poor peasants was not established, they all failed halfway, which was a waste of effort.

　　清河四区
    贫农领导互助巩固
    【本报冀南二十二日电】清河四区马庄等村贫农领导生产，解决三秋中困难，组织互助空前巩固。该区初步树立了贫农骨干，生产中群众感到工具牲口缺乏，所以在种麦中便以贫农为骨干，大量组织了互助。全区共组织起五百九十五组，五千二百一十八人；互助种麦一百九十顷零二十亩，贫农没有麦种，便将果实中的麦子借给了贫农。二十一个村即借出麦子九千九百九十六斤；另借出豆子一万九千五百八十八斤。种麦中并实行了计工换工。种麦结束后，这些互助组并没垮，并且决定长期互助下去；有的已转入副业，例如马庄开染坊，黄台头开烟铺，宁台头开粉坊，赵台头开馒头坊。大家一致感到：贫农当家作主，什么都能胜利，啥事都好办。以前费劲组织起互助组，因没树立贫农骨干，故都半途而废，费力不讨好。
