[Report from our Hebei-Shandong-Henan Office on the 1st] Various counties and districts along the Yellow River are currently holding safety and embankment conferences at all levels to celebrate the safe passage through the major flood season. The Frost's Descent solar term on October 24th marked the end of the major Yellow River flood season. According to the water level records at the Sunkou Dangerous Works section in Shou Zhang, there were a total of nine major floods throughout the year. During each of these major floods, many heroic figures emerged in the rush to protect the embankments. For example, on August 2nd, when the water level in Puyang County rose by one meter on the embankment, a leak occurred at Shi Wangma. A woman, Shi Xiu'e, discovered and reported it. Comrade Liao Yupu, the deputy section chief of that section, immediately issued an alarm. More than a thousand people from over twenty villages, braving torrential rain and the disturbances of Chiang Kai-shek's planes, fought for twenty-nine hours and finally plugged the leak. Now that the major flood season has passed safely, the flood prevention personnel on the embankment have returned home to engage in production with peace of mind. Around the 20th of this month, various counties and sections along the river have successively convened embankment consolidation and flood prevention summaries, as well as safety and embankment conferences to commend the Yellow River control heroes. The safety and embankment conference jointly convened by the Administrative Office and the Yellow River Committee will officially begin on the 10th of this month. At that time, after summarizing and commending models, there will be many merit monuments towering above the embankment, demonstrating our strength to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits.

    冀鲁豫沿河各地
    召开安滥总结会
    庆祝安度大汛期
    【本报冀鲁豫一日电】现沿黄河各县区，为庆祝安度大泛期，正在开着各级的安滥大会。十月二十四日霜降节。为黄河大泛的截止期，根据寿张孙口险工水位纪录，全年大泛共九次，在每次的大泛中，均出现了不少抢护英雄。如八月二日，濮县水位上涨堤垣一公尺，史王麻发生一漏洞，被妇女史秀娥发觉报告，该段副段长廖玉朴同志当即发出警报，二十余村千余群众闻警后，冒倾盆大雨与蒋机的扰乱，奋斗二十九小时，终将漏洞堵住，现大泛期已安然度过，堤上的防泛员已回家安心生产。在本月二十日前后，沿河各县段已先后召开复堤防泛总结，及表扬治黄英雄的安滥大会。行署与黄委会召开的安滥大会，将于本月十日正式开始。届时总结表模后，将有不少的记功碑，高耸于大堤之上，向蒋匪示威。
