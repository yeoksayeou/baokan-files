　　Jiangsu Dam Turns Danger into Safety
    Jun Qian
    When this reporter arrived at the Jiangsu Dam dangerous work site, the first thing that caught my eye was the confluence point of the breach from the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935). Atop the great levee was a winding ditch one meter wide and deep, and over thirty meters long. The local people told me that this was a combat fortification dug by the Chiang bandit army's 68th Division when they occupied the Linpu dangerous work site. On the head of the First Dam below Jiangsu Dam, there was still a brick bunker built by the Chiang bandit army, which had been half dismantled by the masses. The round bunker was two meters in diameter, and the base of the dam inside had been dug more than one meter deep. Several flood-fighting people angrily told the reporter: "There are such bunkers on every dam head, and they have all been demolished and filled by our dam repair team. Chiang is a scoundrel, always up to no good, destroying the dikes, trying to flood the people. When Chiang is caught, he must be handed over to us people to be judged." An old man in his fifties, pointing with an iron shovel at the rolling hills and white desert of Dayanglou and Zhaoliuzhuang, said: "Look! The sand piled up from the breach in the 24th year of the Republic of China, and even now, not a single ridge of crops can be planted. If it breaches again, what will become of us? We have to repair the dam no matter what." When this reporter saw the Second Dam and asked the Juancheng engineering team about how the danger arose, several team members who were working immediately argued: "When we heard that there was a danger, we knew that Chiang's special agents were up to mischief again. When we arrived, we saw that the *sao gěng* (reed bundles) on each dam had been cut. The *gěng* on this Second Dam had been cut seven pairs, thirty-nine pairs on the Third Dam, four pairs of wire ropes on the Fourth Dam, and eleven wire ropes and five pairs of large hemp ropes on the Longmenkou stone dam. With the flood rushing and gouging, how could there not be danger?! If we catch these scoundrels, we can't let them off lightly!" The surging yellow water was impacting the *sao* of the dam. Up and down the levee, the enthusiasm of the masses fighting the Yellow River was boiling. The sounds of various heroic flood-fighting projects constituted a great symphony, while in the south, the sounds of gunfire were frequently heard. The 68th Division of the Chiang bandit army in Heze, in coordination with the "Returning Home Corps," attacked in three routes. One force invaded Kangfengdian and Wangzhuang, another force invaded Wang Chunxiao Village, and another force invaded Baihuji, all of which were repelled by our forces in different directions.
    When the Jiangsu Dam was in danger on one day, the alarm was raised. Comrade Yiping, the Deputy County Secretary of Juancheng, first led cadres and the masses to rush to the dangerous work site from more than fifty *li* away. Comrade Yi Shunjiang, the County Magistrate who had set out for Yanghekou to work, had a sore growing on his right leg. He walked to Juancheng before finding a horse to ride. Unfortunately, he fell off the horse again, breaking his left leg, but he still endured the pain to reach the dangerous work site on the same day. The First Administrative Office assigned each county to rush to transport 800,000 *jin* of sorghum stalks and 500,000 *jin* of willow branches (this year, most of Juancheng's sorghum was cut down by the Chiang bandit army, so they had to travel far to transport sorghum stalks from other counties). The Seventh District of Yuncheng and Ju counties transported 100,000 *jin* of sorghum stalks in one trip from eighty *li* away. In addition to the Juancheng River Repair and Defense Section's engineering team arriving in time, Section Chiefs Liu Minglang and Dong Jianying of the Third River Repair and Defense Office also led technicians and an engineering team to rush from more than 130 *li* away overnight. Many people ran until their feet were swollen and blistered. The Yunbei and Puyang County engineering teams also rushed to the scene overnight. Dong Jincai, an engineering team member of the River Repair and Defense Office, had just returned from work in Puyang County after running more than forty *li*. Without rest, he joined the team and rushed to the dangerous work site. Although his feet were blistered, he did not rest and immediately began the flood-fighting project with everyone. In particular, engineering team leader Li Chongcai, based on his rich experience, first decided to throw stone *zhēn* (weights), saving the crisis of the inner *sao pī dāngzi* (reed bundle apron) of the Second Dam. Wu Chaoyu, Chen Xibao, Long Guangcai, Zhou Fangyuan, and other four members of the Juancheng team, cut stakes for the entire dangerous work site, cutting more than four hundred stakes in one day. Thousands of people from the Second, Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Districts of Juancheng rushed to the scene after hearing the alarm. The laborers from Chen Mengzhuang in the Eighth District transported earth, each person filling more than one *fang* of earth in one morning. Zhao Jinshan from Liuwa, who used to be the leader of the hired labor group, not only did not change shifts while pushing the earth, but also constantly encouraged everyone. Tian Dao'an, the captain of the Fourth Team of flood-fighting laborers in the Second District, took the lead in pushing the earth and even competed with the team members, so that all forty-odd members of the team became activists. Wang Xuejun from Wangtanzhuang was over fifty years old, and he was still limping. When transporting stones, he carried one on his shoulder and another between his waist, often competing with the young and strong. In addition, Deputy Director Zhang of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission and Director Liu of the Fifth River Repair and Defense Office, County Magistrate Yi, Section Chief Shi, and others, were constantly observing the river, studying the water situation, and the function of each dam *sao*. When the engineering team was bundling willow and stone *zhēn* under the Second Dam, Director Liu also participated in the rope-pulling work. The militiamen were constantly patrolling the levee to strictly prevent sabotage by the Chiang bandit army and special agents. With such enthusiastic repair by the Party, government, army, and people, nine large hemp ropes were used in one day to tie the inner *sao* of the *pī dāngzi* of the Second Dam, and new *sao* were added. By the third day, the protective *sao* of the Third Dam was rebuilt, and on the fifth day, a *tóu pán sǎo* (head winding *sao*) was added. On the sixth day, seventeen willow and stone *zhēn* were pushed down from the upper crotch corner of the inner *sao* of the Second Dam, with a plan to push down a total of × ten. It was also decided to push thirty willow and stone *zhēn* on the Third Dam. In this way, the precarious Second and Third Dams were finally transformed from danger to safety.

　　江苏坝转危为安
    君谦
    记者一到江苏坝险工，首先触目的便是在民国二十四年决口的合龙处。大堤顶上有一公尺宽和深、三十多公尺长的曲折沟，老百姓告诉我，这是蒋匪军六八师侵占临濮险工时挖的作战工事。在江苏坝以下的第一坝坝头上，尚有蒋匪军筑的砖碉堡，已被群众拆得剩了一半。那座圆碉堡直径有二公尺，里面将坝基挖了一公尺多深。几个抢险群众非常气愤的对记者说：“各个坝头上都有这样的碉堡，都已为我们修坝队拆毁填平啦。蒋孬种，净生坏点，破坏堤坝，想淹老百姓，逮住老蒋时得交给俺老百姓审审。”一个五十多岁的老头，用铁铣指着大杨楼和赵刘庄一带岗峦起伏白茫茫的沙漠说：“你看！民国二十四年开口子堆的沙，到现在一垅庄稼也不能种，要再开了口还了得，什么不干也得把坝修好。”记者见了第二坝，向鄄城工程队问以如何出的险，几个正在工作的队员就立即争说：“那天一听说出了险，俺就知到又是蒋特捣的鬼，俺赶到一看见各坝上的埽绠都被砍断了。这个二坝的绠，给砍断了七对，三坝上的砍断了三十九对，四坝上的铁丝绳砍断了四对，龙门口石坝上的铁丝绳也给砍断了十一根，和五对大麻绠，大水一冲一掏，能不出险吗？！逮住这些孬种，可不能轻饶他！”黄水汹涌的冲击着坝埽，堤坝上下沸腾着群众与黄水奋斗的热情，各种雄壮的抢险工程声音，构成一曲伟大的交响乐，而南方却频频传来轰通噼拍的枪炮声，菏泽蒋匪军六八师一个团，配合“还乡团”三路出击，一股进犯至康封店、王庄、一股进犯王春孝庄，一股进犯白虎集，均被我们分头击回。
    当江苏坝于一日出险时，警报传出，鄄城副县书沂萍同志，首先率领干部及群众，从五十余里外赶到险工。出发杨河口工作的县长仪顺江同志，右腿正长着疮，步行赶到鄄城，才找到马骑，不幸又摔下马来，摔坏了左腿，但他仍忍痛于一日赶到险工，一专署布置给各县抢运八十万斤秫秸和五十万斤柳枝（今年鄄城的高粱大部被蒋匪军砍了，不得不到外县远道赶运秫秸），郓、巨县七区从八十里外一趟即运到十万斤秫秸。除了鄄城修防段的工程队及时赶到外，第三修防处刘明朗、董剑英两科长也率领技师及工程队，从一百三十余里外星夜赶到。有许多人跑肿了脚，脚上磨了泡。郓北及濮县工程队也都是连夜兼程赶到；修防处工程队员董进才，跑了四十余里，从濮县工作刚回来，没有休息即随队赶到了险工，虽然脚上已磨了泡，仍没有休息，即和大家一同开始了抢险工程，尤其工程队长李崇才，根据他丰富的经验，首先决定了抛石砧，挽救了二坝里头埽批裆子的危急。鄄城队员武朝雨、陈希宝、龙光才、周方元等四人，砍桩供给全部险工用，一天即砍了四百余根。鄄城二、七、八、九等区千余群众，闻警后先后赶到。八区陈孟庄的民工运土，一早晨每人即合一方多土。刘洼过去当过雇工组长的赵金身，推土不但不换班，还时刻鼓励大家。二区抢险民工第四队队长田道安带头推土，还与队员比赛，因而全队四十余人都成了积极分子。王坦庄王学均五十多岁了，还跛着腿，运石时都是肩上扛着一块，腰间还挟着一块，时常和青壮年比赛。另外黄委会张副主任和五修防处刘主任、仪县长、史段长等，则时刻在察看河流，研究水情及各坝埽的作用，当工程队在二坝下捆柳石砧时，刘主任也参加了拉绳工作。而民兵则时刻在堤坝上来往巡逻严防蒋匪军及特务的破坏，党政军民在这样热烈抢修之下，一日即用九条大麻绠将二坝批裆子的里头埽拦腰束住，并加了新埽，至三日重做了三坝的护沿埽，五日又加修了一头盘埽，六日在二坝里头埽的上胯角推下十七个柳石砧，计划共推下×十个，三坝也决定推柳石砧三十个，这么一来，岌岌可危的二、三坝终于得到转危为安。
