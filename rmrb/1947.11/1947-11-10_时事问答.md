    Current Affairs Q & A
    ▲Comrades Qin Shibin, Zhao Heng, and others asked: In the article "Dimitrov Answers Questions from Reporters" published on page 3 of the People's Daily on September 1st, there is a sentence that says "Bulgaria may transition to socialism without going through the dictatorship of the proletariat." What kind of social system does Bulgaria have today, and why can it transition to socialism without going through the dictatorship of the proletariat? Are there any bourgeois political parties in Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and other countries now?
    ▲Answer: Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and other countries are all New Democratic countries. The New Democratic state, in terms of the essence of its state system, is a joint dictatorship of various revolutionary classes. Although the bourgeoisie also participates, the proletariat maintains the leadership. The consolidation and expansion of the proletariat's leadership (represented by the Communist Party) makes it possible to pass and implement political, economic, and cultural facilities that truly meet the interests of the proletariat and the general working people through peaceful legislative procedures, and gradually transition to a proletarian socialist society. The New Democratic system led by the Communist Party itself contains a transitional nature, including the peaceful struggle and transfer of socialist and capitalist elements. Due to the leadership of the proletariat, socialist elements will develop and ultimately negate capitalist remnants. Of course, this peaceful transition from New Democracy to Socialism requires certain international and domestic conditions, the basic of which are the consolidation and expansion of the Communist Party's leadership, and the unity of the domestic working people around the proletarian political party.
    Bulgaria has bourgeois political parties, such as the Zveno party, which initially organized the Fatherland Front. Outside the Fatherland Front, there is the Radical Party, which also represents a part of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie. The activities of the Radical Party are not very clear. The Zveno party, from the War of Resistance Against Germany and the liberation of Bulgaria, to the establishment of the Fatherland Front government, has consistently implemented democratic and progressive policies and maintained close cooperation with the Bulgarian Communist Party.
    We do not have enough material on the political party activities in Yugoslavia to know whether there are other political parties outside the National Front; nor can we answer which political parties make up the National Front.
    ▲Comrade Zhang He asked: I previously read an article by American Communist Party Secretary Dennis entitled "United Action to Achieve the People's Program," in which there is the term "调分子" [diào fèn zi]. What kind of work do these people do in American society? What kind of people in Chinese society today are they equivalent to?
    ▲Answer: The original term "调分子" [diào fèn zi] is probably Share cropper (I don't have the original text). This system exists in the American South, especially among black people. The landlord provides land, fertilizer, seeds, etc., and the black people provide labor. At harvest time, the black people receive a certain amount of agricultural products according to their share. "调分子" [diào fèn zi] is originally a term from northern Shaanxi, and is probably borrowed here, referring to a class of farmers in the United States, similar to the sharecroppers in our area.

    时事问答
    ▲秦士斌、赵蘅等同志问：九月一日人民日报第三版载“季米特洛夫答记者问”一文中，有“保国可能不经过无产阶级专政而过渡到社会主义”一语。保国今天是什么样的社会制度，为什么可以不经过无产阶级专政而过渡到社会主义？保、南等国现在有没有资产阶级政党？
    ▲答：保、南等国都是新民主主义国家。新民主主义的国家，就其国体的本质言，是各个革命阶级的联合专政。其中虽然也有资产阶级参加，但无产阶级保持着领导权。无产阶级（其代表为共产党）领导权的巩固与扩大，就有可能以和平的立法手续，而通过并实行真正付合无产阶级及一般劳动人民利益的政治经济与文化设施，而逐渐过渡到无产阶级的社会主义社会。由共产党领导的新民主主义制度本身就包含着过渡性质，包含着社会主义因素与资本主义因素的和平斗争与转移。由于无产阶级的领导，社会主义因素会日益发展而最后否定资本主义残余。当然这种由新民主主义到社会主义的和平过渡，是需要一定的国际国内条件的，即其中基本的条件，就是共产党领导权的巩固与扩大，国内劳动人民一致团结在无产阶级政党的周围。
    保加利亚是有资产阶级政党的，如开始组织祖国阵线的兹维诺党便是一个；在祖国阵线以外，有急进党，也代表一部分资产阶级与小资产阶级。急进党的活动，不甚清楚。兹维诺党则在抗德战争及保加利亚解放、祖国阵线政府成立迄今，一贯执行民主进步的政策，维持与保共的密切合作。
    南斯拉夫的政党活动，我们迄无足够的材料，不知道在民族阵线之外有无其他政党；民族阵线的组成又有那些政党，恕难作答。
    ▲张和同志问：前阅报载美共书记但尼斯所著“统一行动以争取人民纲领之实现”一文，内有“调分子”一词，在美国社会上是作什么事情的人？相当于中国现社会上那一类人们？
    ▲答：“调分子”原文恐是Ｓｈａｒｅ  ｃｒｏｐｐｅｒ（手头无原文），这在美国南方，尤其是黑人中有此制度。即地主供给土地、肥料、种子等，黑人出劳动力，收获时黑人按入股分得一定量之农产品。“调分子”本是陕北名词，这里当系借用。意指美农民中的一个阶层，类似我区伴种地的佃农。
