　　Visiting the Disabled Veterans' Sanatorium
    Wang Fu
    Here, the Honor of Heroes is Maintained

    How are the soldiers who bravely fought in the Patriotic Self-Defense War and were wounded and disabled being resettled in our liberated areas? This must be a question of great concern to everyone. I also care deeply about these meritorious individuals. Therefore, after arriving in ×× and hearing moving stories about the military sanatorium everywhere, I decided to visit.

    On the morning of July 12th, I arrived at the headquarters of the ×× Town Sanatorium. Hearing the words "sanatorium," people might think of a place where people with missing arms and legs sit idly and rest. However, after my visit, I can tell you that this is not the case.

    This sanatorium is extraordinary. It maintains the heroic spirit and is full of labor and mutual assistance in loving the people.

    This sanatorium was initially established in Dingheya, Fan County, Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region, in October of last year, and moved to its current location in mid-November. According to Director Zhang of the Political Department of the sanatorium, the institution was still in its initial stages before January of this year. From February to the present, the work of the entire sanatorium has made significant progress.

    When many brave soldiers are wounded on the front lines and, after treatment in the hospital, some become disabled and others are temporarily unable to recover, the question is: how to enable their healed bodies to quickly regain their health, how to make their thoughts firm and go to battle and work for the people with even greater spirit, or how to return home and engage in production? Solving these problems is indeed an arduous task. Since the establishment of the sanatorium, a total of 3,500 recuperating individuals have resided there, with a daily average of 2,000. Let's imagine what a person might think when they lose their legs and cannot walk, lose their arms and cannot hold a bowl, and look at their disabled body. We should deeply understand this pain. Some feel sentimental, some feel resentful, thinking about the past and the future, inevitably becoming worried and anxious, which slowly turns into a burden, hindering their progress. How can we constantly remove this burden, so that their acquired honor is always maintained and the heroic spirit continues to be carried forward? This is a huge problem facing the educational institution.

    The sanatorium went through a process of exploration in this regard, and it was not until February of this year that it found the right path. This was achieved under the strong leadership of the higher authorities and by following the mass line.

    A surge of enthusiasm for learning and production was ignited.

    The "Learn Skills" movement was promoted through discussions, grievance sessions, and various other methods. The learning content included culture, crafts, abacus, and needlework. Currently, 95% of the comrades have joined the learning upsurge. According to statistics from six units, the recuperating individuals spent 345,720 yuan of their own money to buy stationery for learning, and 84 learning heroes and 13 model learning classes emerged. In a short period of three or four months, each person learned at least 25 characters, with some learning 300 to 500 characters.

    Learning has enlivened everyone's thoughts and boosted everyone's morale a hundredfold. Wei Zhongxue, a recuperating individual from the Ninth Unit, shed tears for fear of not learning well.

    Song Zhongwen from the Seventh Unit worked hard to learn, as can be explained by his speech at a grievance meeting:

    He was born into a poor peasant family in Zhen'ao Village, Third District, Yutai County, and had never learned to read. One year, during the New Year, he asked Zhen, a wealthy man in his village, to write two pairs of couplets and three ancestral tablets. After they were written, he asked Zhen to mark them so as not to paste them incorrectly. However, after the couplets were posted, passersby gathered around and laughed. Song Zhongwen asked them what they were laughing at, but they were unwilling to explain, only saying that the person who wrote the couplets was insulting him. Song Zhongwen had no choice but to ask a literate friend for help, who then told him that the couplets read:

    "The door is wide and the @ is big, generation after generation produces turtles."

    The ancestral tablets were arranged with: the father above, and the grandmother and grandfather below. Upon understanding this, Song Zhongwen cried bitterly and fainted. The evil landlords used such shameless methods to insult loyal peasants! Song Zhongwen's grievances aroused people's enthusiasm for learning to read, and he himself worked hard to learn and can now write letters.

    Others include: Li Fuheng, a second-class disabled person from the First Unit, who is 58 years old and uses two crutches, and insists on learning two new characters every day. Ma Qingliang from the Fifth Unit lost his right hand and practiced writing with his left hand. Yang Fangting from the Sixth Unit not only studied himself but also spent money to buy six notebooks and a dictionary to distribute to the people in his class.

    In production work, they organized 65% of the entire sanatorium through the mutual assistance method of "passing on skills" and "learning skills." Everyone spun cotton, made shoes, ginned cotton, knitted scarves...using whatever skills they had. The Fifth Unit initially had only five people who could make shoes and vests. Soon, 56 people learned. The Second Platoon of the Third Unit made a profit of 100,000 yuan in two months just by ginning cotton. As a result, the entire sanatorium was filled with a hot production wave, and each unit and platoon resembled a small factory.

    Moreover, whether in learning, production, or daily life, the recuperating individuals and working cadres all displayed a high degree of class friendship, a relationship that can only be seen among revolutionary soldiers.

    The body is damaged, but the spirit of the people's warriors is not damaged.

    Even more vivid is their relationship with the local masses. These revolutionary "crippled soldiers" put forward a slogan:

    "Bravely kill the enemy in the front, and care for the masses in the rear."

    During the spring plowing this year, Liu Wenxiong from the Eighth Unit helped the masses carry water. Wang Songchang and Lu Yugen, who were blind in both eyes, felt their way and raised water to plant seeds. The Third Platoon of crutch users also planted 32 mu of cotton in two days. During the wheat harvest, Tian Shuangsuo, who had his right hand amputated, and Xue Youcai, who had his left hand amputated, from the Eighth Class, cut the wheat together, one cutting and the other holding. The comrades from the Tenth Class of the Sixth Unit, seeing that their landlord was having difficulty in life, all donated more than 2,000 yuan to buy a斗 (dǒu - a unit of dry measure) of rice for the landlord. When two disabled people carried water for the landlord's old lady, the old lady was moved to tears and immediately tore a piece of cloth from her loom to wipe their sweat.

    They not only helped the masses with production but also enthusiastically helped the masses with learning. For example, Duan Buqing from the Third Unit bought paper and copied down the important news from each issue of the newspaper and posted it on the street for the masses to see.

    The statistical figures of their assistance to the masses cannot be listed one by one. Here are a few examples: 1,520 people from the entire sanatorium participated in planting, and statistics from seven units over three days showed that they planted a total of 224 mu of land and carried 16,178 loads of water. 2,756 people participated in the wheat harvest, and in three days, they helped 424 households harvest 1,460 mu of wheat. As for helping the masses carry water, sweep the floor, push manure, and push the millstone in daily life, it is difficult to count.

    Is this easy? Everyone must not forget that they are disabled people! However, even though their bodies are damaged, they have absolutely not damaged the spirit of the people's warriors to serve the people.

    Now, 3,600 recuperating individuals have left the sanatorium one after another. Dragging their disabled bodies, they have plunged into the great struggle for victory and democracy. We believe that in every corner of the liberated areas, they will create many more miracles.

　　访残废军人教养院
    往夫
    在这里保持着英雄的荣誉
    爱国自卫战争中英勇作战因而负伤残废了的军人，在我们解放区中是怎样安置的呢？这一定是大家很关心的问题，我也很挂念这些功臣们，因此，当我到××以后，到处传讲着军人教养院的动人的故事，我就决心去访问。
    七月十二日上午，我到了××镇教养院的院部。人们一听“教养院”三字也许会以为是个臂残腿断的人们闲坐休养的地方；但是访问过后，我可以告诉你，不是如此。
    这个教养院，却不平凡，这里保持着英雄气概，也充满劳动和爱民互助的热情。
    这所教养院去年十月间初成立于冀鲁豫区范县丁河涯；十一月中旬移住现地。据院部政治处张主任谈，今年一月以前还未脱初创时期；二月开始到现在，全院工作却有了显著的进展。
    当许多英勇的战士，从前线负伤下来，经过医院治疗，有的残废了，有的身体一时不能复原，这时候的问题是：如何使伤口痊愈的身躯，迅速获得健康，如何使他们思想坚定，更加精神百倍的去为人民战斗，为人民工作，或复员按家投入生产？解决这些问题，实在是一种艰巨的任务。从该院成立到现在，先后共住休养员三千五百人，日常人数总以两千计。我们试想一想，当一个人失去腿脚不能走路，失去手臂不能端碗，他眼望着残废的身躯，脑子里会想些什么呢？这种痛苦是我们应该深切体贴的。这其中，有的感伤，有的怨尤，想过去想将来，未免顾虑烦燥起来，慢慢地这就会变成包袱，阻碍他们的进步。怎样才能随时解除包袱，使他们既得的荣誉永远保持，使英雄气概继续发扬呢？这就是摆在教育院面前的一个巨大问题。
    教养院在这上面经过一番摸索过程，直到今年二月间，才摸到门路。这是在上级的坚强领导下，走群众路线才走通的。
    鼓起了学习及生产热潮。
    “学本事”运动是由讨论、诉苦种种方式推动起来的。学习内容包括文化，手艺，算盘，针工。现在，百分之九十五的同志已经涌入学习热潮，据六个单位统计，休养员为了学习，自己拿出三十四万五千七百二十元买文具，并涌现出八十四名学习英雄，十三个模范学习班，在短短三四个月的时间内，每人至少学到二十五个字，多者学到三百至五百字。
    学习使每个人的思想活跃起来，使每个人的情绪百倍提高。第九所的休养员魏中学，为担心学习不好而流泪。
    第七所的宋中文所以努力学习，可以从他在一次诉苦大会上的发言来说明：
    他家住在鱼台县三区甄凹村，贫农出身，不曾习字。有一年新年到了，他请本村甄老财给写两付对联，和三个先人牌位。写好以后又请甄老财画定记号，以免贴错。可是对联贴出之后，过往的人都围看嗤笑，宋中文问他们笑什么，人家也不愿说个明白，只是说，写这对联的人欺辱你。宋中文无法，找到一位识字好友求教，这才知道那对联是：
    “门阔＠也大辈辈出王八”
    先人的牌位则是：父亲尊其上，祖母祖父列其下。宋中文一听明白，气的痛哭失声，昏迷过去。万恶的地主们，竟用这样无耻的手法欺辱忠诚的农民！宋中文的诉苦，激起人们认字的热情，他自己也努力学习，现在已可以写信了。
    其他如：一所柱双拐的二等残废，五十八岁的李福恒。也每天必学两个生字。五所马清良失去右手，就用左手练习写字。六所杨芳廷，不仅自己学习，又拿钱买下六个本子一个字典分发给本班的人。
    在生产工作上，他们通过“传手艺”“学本事”的互助方式，把全院百分之六十五的人都组织起来，大家纺花、做鞋、轧花、打围巾……有什么本事出什么本事。五所原只五个人会作鞋、打背心，不久，就有五十六人齐学会了。三所二排，两个月光轧花获利十万元，——这样一来，全院处处是热烈的生产潮，各所各排，俨然象小工厂一般。
    而且，不管在学习、生产或日常生活中，休养员以及工作干部，都发扬了高度的阶级友爱精神，这种关系是只有革命军人中才可以见到的。
    损伤了身体，损伤不了人民战士的精神。
    更其生动的，就是他们和当地群众的关系了。这些革命的“拐子兵”们提出了一个口号是：
    “在前方英勇杀敌，在后方爱护群众。”
    今年春耕时，八所刘文雄帮助群众担水，二目俱瞎的王松长和路玉根二人摸索着抬水点种，拐子三排，也在两晌之内，点种棉花三十二亩。麦收期间，八班锯右手的田双锁和二班锯左手的薛友才，一个人割，一人拿。六所十班的同志，看见房东生活困难，大家齐捐出两千多元，给房东买来一斗米，又当两个残废人给房东老太太担水的时候，感动的老太太热泪并流，马上从手下的织布机上撕下一块布来，为他们擦汗。
    他们不仅帮助群众生产，又热心帮助群众学习，如三所段步青，自己买纸，把每期报上的重要消息抄录下来，贴到街上给群众看。
    他们帮助群众的统计数目，不能一一例举，现举一、二例如下：全院一千五百廿人参加点种，三天中七个单位统计，共种地二百二十四亩，担水一万六千一百七十八担。二千七百五十六人参加麦收，三天帮助四百二十四户割麦一千四百六十亩，至于日常生活中帮助群众担水、扫地、推粪、推磨，那就难于以数计了。
    这是很容易的吗？大家不可忘记，他们是残废人哪？可是，纵然身体损伤了，却绝没有损伤了人民战士为的人民服务的精神。
    现在，三千六百名修养员，已先后走出教养院了。他们拖着残废的身体，又投入了各种争胜利，争民主的伟大斗争中，我们相信，在解放区的各个角落，他们还会创造出许多奇迹来的。
