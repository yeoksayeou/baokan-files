　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: The plan for a line traversing the great Northwest of China, devised by US imperialism to facilitate its aggression in the area, is being actively constructed by the Chiang Kai-shek clique. This line takes the Tianshui-Lanzhou section of the Longhai Railway as its base, extending north along the Gansu-Qinghai and Qinghai-Xinjiang highways, and connects south to the Chengdu-Tianshui Road, the Yunnan-Kangding Road, and the Yunnan-Burma Road leading to the sea. According to a Central News Agency report on the 18th, the Qinghai-Xinjiang highway, with a total length of 1,221 kilometers, has been completed and opened to traffic. The construction of the Chengdu-Tianshui Railway was originally decided to be financed by loans from French syndicates, but is now being financed by loans from the Canadian government, a US satellite. The surveying work for other sections, such as the Sichuan-Kangding and Yunnan-Kangding sections, has also begun long ago. The Chiang Kai-shek authorities have organized various survey groups for this purpose, and US military personnel have directly participated in the surveys. Since the Japanese surrender, the US military authorities in China have, under the pretext of searching for missing airmen, dispatched investigation teams, carrying weapons and various survey instruments, along with American journalists, deep into the Liangshan area of the Xikang Yi region to conduct line surveys and general geographical investigations. Although it was proven by all parties at the time that the so-called "American airmen lost in the Liangshan area and enslaved" was a completely fabricated fiction, the US military authorities still insisted on proceeding. As early as during the War of Resistance Against Japan, US imperialism, under the pretext of searching for the supply line from India to China, sent two Strategic Intelligence Bureau agents to reside in Tibet; later, it further dispatched a so-called "goodwill visiting group" to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, to seek to establish so-called "friendly relations" with Tibet. Recently, Yale University in the United States established a Department of Tibetan Culture, all of which indicate that US imperialism is deliberately plotting to invade China's Great Northwest and Tibet.

　　蒋匪大修西北交通
  　满足美帝侵略野心
  　美深入康藏勘测和调查
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】美帝国主义为便于侵略中国大西北所拟定之贯穿大西北线路计划，正由蒋匪当局积极兴建中。该线路系以陇海路天（水）兰（州）段为基干，北循甘（肃）青（海）、青（海）新（疆）两公路，南接成（都）天（水）路、滇康路、滇缅路出海。据中央社十八日消息，全长一千二百二十一公里之青新公路已建成通车。成天铁路之开建原决定向法国银团借款，现改向美国附庸加拿大政府贷款。其他川康段、滇康段之勘察工作亦早已开始。蒋匪当局曾为此组织各种考察团，美军人员并直接参与勘察。自日本投降后，在华美军当局借口寻找失踪航空员，派遣调查团，携带武器及各种调查工具，连同美国新闻人员，深入西康罗罗区大凉山，进行线路勘测和普遍地理调查。当时虽经各方证明所谓“美航空员失落罗罗区被奴役”完全为一莫须有之虚构，但美军当局依然坚持进行。美帝国主义早在抗战中间即借口寻找由印运华运输线，派有战略情报局局员二人，驻在西藏；后又进一步派遣所谓“亲善访问团”赴西藏首府拉萨，谋与西藏建立所谓“亲善关系”，最近美国耶鲁大学复设立西藏文化一科，此皆表示美帝国主义正处心积虑侵略中国之大西北及西藏。
