　　Jiang Bandits in Border Areas Struggle to Death
    Frantically Seizing Grain from Our Various Areas
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Military Region News: The Jiang bandits in the border areas are in a desperate situation. In order to make a last-ditch struggle, they have recently intensified their grain grabbing. In the Yu-Bei (Northern Henan) area: Starting from the 1st of this month, the 366th Regiment of the 122nd Brigade of the enemy's 41st Division, combined with local security teams, township offices, and other reactionary armed forces, have been seizing grain from the vicinity of various county towns along the Daoqing Railway in Huojia, Xiuwu, and Wuzhi. East of the Ping-Han Railway, the bandit Wang Sanzhu's troops, combined with local thugs from Fengqiu, Yanjin, Qi County, and Ji County, have been seizing grain, operating as far as the Huangdeji and Niushitun areas northwest of Yanjin. West of the Ping-Han Railway, with Huixian as the focus, the entire 364th Regiment and one battalion of the 365th Regiment of the enemy's 41st Division, in coordination with local teams, have been seizing grain, operating in Baiquan, Xiezhuang, and other places. The enemy in Xinxiang dispatched a battalion on the 2nd to invade Chenbao, west of the city. The enemy's 40th Division in Anyang summoned the Kuomintang refugee county governments of Tangyin, Neihuang, and other places to a meeting to organize "refugees" to return to their hometowns to seize grain. On the 6th, the 117th Regiment of the enemy's 40th Division and the "People's Self-Defense Corps" of Anyang, Ci County, and other counties began to move out to Shangxiaboshu, Zhanghuding, and other places. In the Jinzhong area: Each of Pingyao, Jiexiu, Lingshi, Qi County, Taigu, and Yuci has a Yan Xishan army division (or provisional brigade) combined with local "security police teams" and "love-the-hometown corps" to seize grain in all directions. In addition, Zhao Chengshui led the bandit 71st Division and 46th Division as mobile troops, moving from Taigu to Yuci to Shouyang. From the 20th to the 23rd of last month, they seized 1,700 shi of grain in the vicinity of Fancun, Taigu alone. The enemy in Linfen even planned to seize 7,000 shi of grain around the city. The characteristics of this enemy grain seizure are that it is comprehensive, yet focused (Jinzhong is now Shouyang, and Yu-Bei is Huixian); it uses regular troops as the backbone and combines with political espionage activities. It not only achieves the economic goal of seizing grain but also attempts to train its troops, expand its area, and nibble away at our border areas in the process of seizing grain. One characteristic of their actions is that they dare to penetrate deeply with isolated troops. For example, the enemy's 9th Brigade in Taigu went deep into Fancun and Wu Ke; the enemy's 8th Brigade in Yuci extended to Changning, Daoping, and other old liberated areas; Wang Sanzhu's troops raided Shangguancun, which belongs to Jun County; and more than 100 enemies from Yuanshi dared to operate in areas 50 miles south of the city. Second, they often use a regular force of one battalion or more to control important villages and towns or mountain passes, build strongholds, and use local teams, township offices, etc., to seize grain over a wide area.

　　边地蒋匪垂死挣扎
    向我各地疯狂抢粮
    【本报特讯】军区讯：边沿区各地蒋匪陷于穷途末路，为作垂死挣扎，近日抢粮益形猖獗。豫北方面：本月一日起，道清线获嘉、修武、武陟由敌四十一师一二二旅三六六团结合当地保安团队、乡公所等反动武装向各县城周附近抢粮。平汉路以东，由匪王三祝部结合封邱、延津、淇县、汲县土顽抢粮，一直活动到延津西北黄德集、牛市屯地区。平汉路西以辉县为重点，由敌四十一师一二二旅三六四团全部、三六五团一个营配合地方团队抢粮，活动到百泉、谢庄等地。新乡敌出动一个营于二日侵犯至城西之陈堡。安阳敌四十师召集汤阴、内黄等蒋记流亡县府开会，组织“难民”还乡抢粮。六日，敌四十师一一七团及安阳、磁县等县“人民自卫总队”即开始向上下柏树、张胡顶等地出动。晋中方面：平遥、介休、灵石、祁县、太谷、榆次各有阎军一个师（或暂编总队），结合当地“保警队”、“爱乡团”等四出抢粮。另赵承绥率匪七一师、四十六师作为机动部队，由太谷而榆次而寿阳，上月二十日至二十三日，仅在太谷范村附近，即抢去一千七百石。临汾敌竟计划在城周抢粮七千石。此次敌抢粮的特点是全面的，又是有重点的（晋中现为寿阳，豫北为辉县）；以正规军为骨干，并与政治特务活动结合。不仅达到抢粮的经济目的，而且企图在抢粮中锻炼其部队，扩大地区，蚕食我边沿区。其行动特点一是敢于孤军深入。如太谷敌九总队一直深入到范村、五科；榆次敌八总队一直伸到长凝、道坪等老解放区来；王三祝部一直奔袭到浚县属的上官村；元氏敌百余人敢活动到城南五十里地区。二是常以一个营以上正规兵力控制重要村镇或山口，构筑据点，另以地方团队、乡镇公所等作面的抢粮。
