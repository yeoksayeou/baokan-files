　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 16th: During our army's battle to liberate Shijiazhuang, the people of Shidong, who had suffered greatly under the bandit-puppet regime, warmly welcomed our army. Villages along the way were adorned with lanterns and streamers, and drums and gongs resounded. In the evening, the masses from each village gathered at the street entrance to welcome them. As soon as our army arrived at the edge of the village, the whole village immediately burst into a lively and prosperous scene, with cheers and songs everywhere. They vacated rooms and lent quilts, vying to welcome the liberated soldiers to stay in their homes. Outside the village entrances, large red silk tents were hung, with the words "Welcome the People's Liberation Army to Liberate Us!" written on them. In villages around Waitong, Daxizhang, and Xiaoxizhang, every household had an oil lamp lit on a table at their door, filled with peanuts and other fruits. As our army passed by, the masses rushed to stuff peanuts and other items into the soldiers' hands and pockets. The masses in the areas of the fifth, sixth, and seventh districts of Gao (cheng), Zheng (ding), and Huo (lu) also established support-the-front committees. The masses near Bo Zhuang and Waishi Ditch rushed to comfort the wounded late at night. The masses in Hantong, Beidou, Bafang, and other villages made more than 1,200 jin of pancakes and personally delivered them to the front lines.
   
　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 15th: Late news: In the Baobei Campaign, 46,000 organized masses from western Hebei surged to the front lines to directly cooperate in the battle. In addition to more than 20,000 laborers accompanying the army to participate in breaking railways, building fortifications, and transforming the terrain, effectively assisting the troops in completing combat missions, according to incomplete statistics, more than 1,100 large carts and 4,915 livestock participated in transportation, transporting 1.1 million jin of public grain and sufficiently supplying ammunition and equipment to the front. In terms of transferring the wounded, more than 3,000 front and rear stretchers were organized, and many exemplary deeds emerged. The Xushui militia stretcher team, at the very front line, separated from the enemy by only a wall, completed the glorious task of transporting ammunition and rescuing the wounded under artillery fire. The Dingxing stretcher team, saving money at the front, had more than 70,000 yuan left over, which they used to buy snacks and eggs to comfort the wounded.
