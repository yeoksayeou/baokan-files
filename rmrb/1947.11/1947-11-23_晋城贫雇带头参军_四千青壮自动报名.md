(Reported from Taiyue on the 21st by our newspaper) “Join the Liberation Army and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive!” This upsurge has now swept through Jin City. Four thousand emancipated peasants immediately signed up, and more than two hundred honorably discharged soldiers rejoined the front lines. After the Jin City County Committee called on November 8th to "Fight to Nanjing and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive," the entire county shouted, "Join the Liberation Army and dig up the roots of Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing." Wang Jishou, a hero of emancipation in Heiquangou, Third District, was bedridden, but he called his son, Wang Xiaowan, to his bedside and instructed him, "We were poor in the past because of the oppression and exploitation of Chiang Kai-shek and the landlords. Today, Chairman Mao led us to turn over a new leaf. We must also dig up the roots of Chiang Kai-shek, so that I can die in peace." So Xiaowan was the first to sign up for the army that night. The villagers of Yuneng Village discussed joining the army overnight, and the hired and poor peasants unanimously said, "We took the lead in digging up the small roots last year, and we will take the lead in digging up the old roots this year." Then, the poor peasant Du Baisheng, the hired laborer Shunhai, and others took the lead in joining the army. Sun Chunyi, an honorably discharged soldier, also signed up to return to the front lines. Fifty-one people signed up that night. Guo Qisan, an old hired worker in the Seventh District, had two sons and a brother. The father, sons, and brother all joined the army together and swore an oath: "We will not return home until we capture Chiang Kai-shek alive." When Meng Shuihe, an emancipated poor peasant who worked as a reed weaver, sent his son to join the army, he said, "Now our counter-offensive is like climbing stairs. We have already climbed ninety-nine steps. Son, go ahead, just put in a little effort at this last step and we will reach the top." In less than three days, a total of 4,078 people in various districts and villages voluntarily signed up to join the army. This shows the high level of class consciousness of the emancipated peasants and the greatness of the people's power. Subsequently, family members in various villages, especially women, made plans with their husbands and competed in killing the enemy and producing. He Taotao, a woman from Nandu Village in the Sixth District, guaranteed to her husband that she would cultivate the land well and raise the children well. Meng Shuihe guaranteed to his son that he would participate in the mutual aid group to cultivate the land well and increase production. His son was so moved by his father that he also made plans to kill the enemy. In particular, the members of the Yuneng Sanhe Mutual Aid Group who joined the army swore an oath to the entire group before leaving that, in addition to working hard to learn skills and strive to become heroes in killing the enemy, they would also help the masses in the newly liberated areas to turn over a new leaf and produce while fighting, and bring the methods of the Sanhe Mutual Aid Group to the newly liberated areas so that the masses in the newly liberated areas could also become rich. According to Taiyue, since the great counter-offensive, more than 22,000 people have joined the army, and the movement to join the army is now sweeping from Jin City to various parts of northern Henan.

(Reported from Jiluyu on the 21st by our newspaper) On the 6th of this month, the Fifth District of Nanle held a meeting of more than 2,000 village cadres and party members to discuss how to support the patriotic war. The opinions discussed by each group were mostly consistent. In addition to thoroughly investigating landlords in the rear and working hard on various war service tasks, the most active method was to continuously invest in the army and strengthen the armed forces. Therefore, when the general meeting was held the next day, Yao Zhenbin of Qianfo Village first said, "More than 40 party members in our village have the same opinion: to lead the masses to join the army." Li Chengxian of Xichongding said, "More than 20 party members in our village have signed up to join the army." A peasant from Beiquetou said, "We are the first to fight the landlords, and we will certainly not lag behind in joining the army." Then, from every corner came shouts of "Report, I want to sign up, I want to resolutely defeat Old Chiang." "I will also join the army, and I will not come back until Old Chiang is eliminated." Five hundred people signed up to join the army on the spot. They also discussed how to get through the masses' thinking after returning to the village, and a competition was launched among the villages, with the conditions being: (1) Guarantee no buying or coercion, follow the mass line. (2) Guarantee that women will not hold back.

    【本报太岳二十一日电】“参加解放军活捉蒋介石”，这一热潮现已卷至晋城。马上有四千翻身农民报名，并有二百余荣退军人重上前线。晋城县委在十一月八日，号召“打到南京去，活捉蒋介石”后，全县到处叫唤着：“参加解放军，打到南京刨老根。”三区黑泉沟翻身英雄王吉首，正卧病在床，便将自己的儿子王小完叫到床前嘱咐说：“咱过去穷就是因为蒋介石和地主压迫剥削的，今天毛主席领导咱翻了身，咱还要刨了蒋介石的老根，这样我就死了也痛快。”于是小完当夜即第一个报名参军。庾能村连夜讨论参军，雇贫农一致说：“去年刨小根是我们带头，今年刨老根我们还要带头”。接着贫农杜柏生、雇农顺孩等带头参军。荣退军人孙春义，也报名重上前线。当夜即有五十一人报名。七区老雇工郭启三，有两个儿子与一个兄弟，父子兄弟四人，一齐参了军，并宣誓“不活捉蒋介石誓不还家。”苇匠翻身贫农孟水合送子参军时说：“现在咱们的反攻，象上楼梯一样，台阶已上了九十九层，孩你去吧，就这一圪台努一把力，就上去了。”总计各区村不及三天，即有四千零七十八人自动报名参军。显示出翻身农民阶级觉悟之高及人民力量的伟大。随后各村家属，尤其妇女与丈夫互订计划，竞赛杀敌生产。六区南渡村妇女贺桃桃，向丈夫保证将地种好，将儿养大；孟水合对他儿子保证参加互助组，把地种好增加产量，其子被父感动的也订出杀敌计划。尤其庾能三合互助组的参军组员，临行时向全组宣誓，除努力学会本领争取杀敌英雄外，并在打仗中帮助新区群众翻身生产，将三合互助的办法带到新区去，让新区群众也发财致富。按太岳自大反攻以来，已有两万二千余人参军，现参军运动正由晋城卷向豫北各地。
    【本报冀鲁豫二十一日电】南乐五区，于本月六日召开两千余人的村干及党员大会，讨论如何支援爱国战争。各组讨论意见大多一致，除在后方澈查地主、努力各种战勤工作外，最积极的方法还是源源不断的投入军队，壮大武装力量。所以当第二天进行大会讨论时，千佛村姚振斌首先说：“俺村四十多个党员，都是一个意见，要带领群众去参军。”西崇町李承先说：“俺村二十多个党员报名参军。”北渠头翻身农民××说：“斗争地主咱是头份，参军当更不落后。”接着从各个角落中发出“报告，我要报名，我要坚决打老蒋。”“我也参军，不消灭老蒋不回来。”当场即有五百人报名参军。又讨论回村后如何打通群众思想，各村间展开了竞赛，条件是：（一）保证不收买，不强迫，走群众路线。（二）保证妇女不拉腿。
