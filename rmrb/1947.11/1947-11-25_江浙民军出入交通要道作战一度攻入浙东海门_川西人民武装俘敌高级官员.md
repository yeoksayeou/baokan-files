Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: According to a compilation of Shanghai newspaper reports: People's armed forces in Jiangnan seize weapons from the enemy to strengthen themselves. Local Chiang Kai-shek bandit teams, threatened by the people's armed forces, have repeatedly defected with their arms. On the evening of October 21st, dozens of people's armed personnel in eastern Zhejiang seized all the firearms from the Meixu Township police station in Juandong and the nearby Jianmei Township government. Reuters, Nanjing, reported on the 20th of this month that the people's armed forces in eastern Zhejiang had attacked Haimen, an important town east of Huangyan, on the 19th.

On the afternoon of October 24th, more than ten people's armed men suddenly appeared in Guanshan Township, Hushu Pass, Wu County (Suzhou), on the Shanghai-Nanjing Road, surrounded the local self-defense force, captured two deputy leaders and squad leaders, and seized seven long and short guns and more than a hundred rounds of ammunition. On October 18th, the people's armed forces burned the No. 8 bridge on the Qingpu-Shanghai Highway, about 20 li from Qingpu City. On the same day, the Tongxing Steamer, which was sailing from Hangzhou to Wu County, was attacked. On the 19th, when the Chiang Kai-shek bandit self-defense force in Dongzhu Town, Wu County, searched a ship sailing from Wu County to Xihua, six or seven people's armed men with weapons suddenly jumped out of the cabin and captured You Wenda, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit self-defense force instructor. On October 15th, the first detachment of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit "self-defense force" in Nanxiashe Town, 7th District, Changzhou, Jiangsu, was ordered to search for people's armed forces in Shangdian and Gangqiao. When they were resting at Siqiao, five li southeast of the town, they were fiercely attacked by the people's armed forces, who had been informed in advance, with automatic pistols and rifles. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit platoon leader Xu Xiaochao and six others were killed on the spot, and two were wounded. The remaining bandits fled in panic.

Soldiers of the Third Detachment of the Third Company of the Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Wuxi Security Brigade, unable to endure hunger and cold, staged an armed uprising in Nanfangquan, their garrison, on October 28th, arrested the Chiang Kai-shek bandit detachment leader Wu Huaguang and 28 others, and sailed towards Wuxing by boat. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit Wuxi County Magistrate, in addition to begging the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Wuxing and Yixing counties to "intercept" them, also telegraphed the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Jiangsu Provincial Security Command to "plead guilty." The Chiang Kai-shek bandit self-defense force in Lupo Township, Dinghai, eastern Zhejiang, also revolted on October 25th. Dai Wenheng, Wang Binglin, Wang Yuezheng, and six others took a light machine gun, a submachine gun, two Mauser pistols, and sixteen rifles to join the people's armed forces.

The Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities in Jiangsu are extremely panicked by the increasing development of the people's armed forces. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit Security Command issued eleven "Measures for Strengthening the Security Teams in Various Counties" on October 22nd, stipulating that each county in southern Jiangsu should have no less than one company of Chiang Kai-shek bandit security teams, and three to five companies in northern Jiangsu, in an attempt to prevent the development of the people's armed forces. Chiang Kai-shek bandit Jiangsu Provincial Chairman Wang Maogong inspected the "public security" of Yixing, Liyang, Gaochun, Jurong, and Lishui counties on October 23rd. The Wu County (Suzhou) Chiang Kai-shek bandit city defense headquarters began "winter defense" on November 1st, imposing martial law from 12:00 midnight to 6:00 the next morning, and closing the city gates to prohibit traffic. At the same time, 300 urban and rural district police officers were transferred to the city to form an armed police team and given military training to prevent attacks by the people's armed forces. On the morning of October 17th, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits conducted a "sudden household registration check" in Jinlu and Huqiu towns near Wu County, arresting about 200 innocent residents in one sweep, showing the panic of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 23rd: According to a compilation of Shanghai newspaper reports: The "Sichuan-Xikang Border Grassland Investigation Group" organized by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Sichuan Provincial Government departed from Chengdu last month and went deep into western Sichuan. On the 20th, when it arrived at Sugou in Maogong County, it was suddenly attacked by the people's militia. All the members of the group were captured (including high-ranking officials, pseudo-senators, and technicians sent by various departments of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Provincial Government), and only the head of the group, He Benchu, stayed in Lifan County and escaped. In addition, tens of thousands of the Wazha Erjia branch of the Black Yi ethnic group in eastern Xikang, after being forced by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit "Border Pacification Command" to evacuate Ningdong, have risen up to save themselves, possessing thousands of guns, and recently plan to return to their homeland to recover lost territory.

　　江浙民军出入交通要道作战一度攻入浙东海门
    川西人民武装俘敌高级官员
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】综合沪报讯：江南人民武装夺取敌人武器壮大自己，蒋匪地方团队在人民武装威胁下，接连携械投诚。十月二十一号晚，浙东人民武装数十名，一举将鄄东梅墟镇警察派出所及附近监梅乡公所两地枪械全部缴去。另据路透社南京本月二十日电，浙东人民武装于十九日已攻入黄岩东面重镇海门。
    十月二十四号下午，京沪路上之吴县（苏州）浒墅关管山乡，突出现人民武装十余人，将该乡自卫队包围，俘队附班长两人，缴长短枪七枝，子弹百余发。十月十八日清晨，人民武装将青（浦）沪公路距青浦城约二十里之第八号桥梁焚毁，同日由杭州驶吴县之同兴轮被袭击，十九日吴县东渚镇蒋匪自卫队搜查由吴县驶西华之轮船时，船舱中突跃出手执武器之人民武装六七人，将蒋匪自卫队教练尤文达俘去。十月十五日，江苏常州七区南夏墅镇蒋匪“自卫队”一分队，奉令向上店、港桥搜索人民武装，行至离该镇东南五里之寺桥休息时，即为预告探悉之人民武装用盒子枪及快枪痛击，当场击毙蒋匪分队长许啸潮以下六人，伤两人，余匪抱头窜去。
    蒋匪无锡保安大队三中队第三分队士兵，不堪饥寒交迫，于十月二十八日在驻地南方泉武装起义，逮捕蒋匪分队长吴华光以下二十八人，乘船向吴兴方面驶去。蒋匪无锡县长除哀求吴兴、宜兴两县蒋匪“堵击”外，并电蒋匪江苏省保安司令部“请罪”。浙东定海芦浦乡蒋匪自卫队，亦于十月二十五日起义，戴文衡、汪柄林、王曰正等九人，携轻机枪及手提机枪各一挺，驳壳枪二枝，步枪十六枝投奔人民武装。
    江苏蒋匪当局对人民武装日益发展恐慌异常，蒋匪保安司令部于十月二十二日颁布“各县保安队加强办法”十一条，规定江南各县蒋匪保安队每县不得少于一个中队，苏北各县以三至五个中队为原则，妄图借此阻挠人民武装发展。蒋匪苏省主席王懋功于十月二十三日出巡宜兴、溧阳、高淳、句容、溧水五县视察各该县“治安”。吴县（苏州）蒋匪城防部已于十一月一日开始“冬防”，每晚十二时起至翌晨六时施行戒严，并关闭城门禁止通行。同时并抽调城乡区警士三百名集中城厢，组织武装警察队，施以军事训练以防人民武装进攻。十月十七号清晨，蒋匪在吴县附近金闾、虎丘两镇举行“户口突击抽查，”一次即捕去无辜居民约二百人。足见蒋匪之慌张。
    【新华社华东二十三日电】综合沪报讯：蒋匪四川省府组织之“川边草地考察团”，上月由成都出发深入川西，二十日，抵懋功县之苏沟，突遭民军袭击，团员全部被俘（内包括蒋匪省府各厅处所派高级职员、伪参议员及技术人员，悉数被俘），仅团长何本初滞留理番县幸免。又，西康东部少数民族瓦渣耳呷支黑夷族数万人，自被蒋匪“靖边司令部”压迫撤离宁东后，奋起自救，拥有枪支数千，最近拟重归故土收复失地。
