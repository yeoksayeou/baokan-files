　　Pingding Sends Off 1,800 Young Men for Military Service; Over 6,000 People in the Urban Area Cheer Them On

　　[Our Newspaper Pingding News] Under the slogans of "Thoroughly Uproot the Old Roots and Completely Transform Ourselves" and "March to Nanjing, Capture Chiang Kai-shek Alive," Pingding convened expanded meetings of district and village cadres on October 22nd to conduct extensive propaganda for the great counter-offensive. Led by cadres and Party members from all districts and villages throughout the county, a surge of enthusiasm for joining the army swept across the region. In just three days, 2,818 young men throughout the county signed up to go to the front lines. After several rounds of review by villages, districts, and the county, 1,832 were formally enlisted. On the 2nd of this month, representatives from all villages in the county and over 6,000 people from the urban area gathered to celebrate and send off the new soldiers. A public trial was also held for the puppet county magistrate Jiao Guangsan. In this round of recruitment, many villages sent entire squads and platoons of young men to join the army. In Donggou, District Six, 204 people formed a counter-offensive company. Zhang Zhuxiao from Chenjiazhuang, District One, had already sent two of his three children to join the army, and this time he sent the other three. Zhai Yunhua from Qian Suohuang, Zhao Jinyun and Zhao Meilan from Xi Baian, and others, encouraged their husbands to join the army. Hou Guisuo from Dongguan, and Zhang Zhenhai from Xuemen Street, were sent to the army by their mothers. According to statistics from 31 villages, there were 30 cases of fathers sending sons, 12 cases of mothers sending sons, 10 cases of wives sending husbands, 6 cases of brothers competing with each other to join, 4 cases of fathers sending two sons, 3 cases of elder brothers encouraging younger brothers, 2 cases of younger brothers encouraging elder brothers, 2 cases of elder sisters encouraging younger brothers, 319 cases of village cadres leading the way, 6 district cadres, 743 militiamen, and 222 Communist Party members.

　　At the rally, the County Party Committee proposed that the new soldiers learn two skills in the army: first, bravely kill the enemy; second, connect with the masses, practice diligently, and improve their techniques. It also called on Party members to become role models in the army, and government representatives pledged to do a good job in preferential treatment and support for military families. The entire venue was filled with the sounds of gongs and drums. Women sang songs and held over 1,800 flowers to put on the new soldiers. Finally, under the passionate emotion of the masses, a temporary people's court was organized on the spot to try the puppet county magistrate Jiao Guangsan, the Kuomintang head Liu Zhenzhong, and other four war criminals. After the masses had their say and expressed their grievances, the war criminals were handed over to the people for disposal, greatly satisfying the people's hearts. The new soldiers' class hatred was further heightened, and the slogan "Capture Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan alive and hand them over to the masses for disposal" resounded throughout the venue.
