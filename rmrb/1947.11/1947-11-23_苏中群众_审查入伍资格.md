Xinhua News Agency, East China, 19th: The masses in Central Jiangsu are strictly examining the qualifications for joining the army, to ensure the purity of the people's armed forces. In Santang Township, Dongtai, after landlord Lin Chengyu signed up his son for the army at a mass meeting, he immediately threatened the poor peasants and hired farmhands, saying: "I am also a military family member now. You should quickly send comfort gifts and prepare to deliver rent grain next year." Yang Yousan, a feudal rich peasant from Shaozhuang, Baoying, falsely signed up for the army and said he would mobilize twelve people to enlist. He spread rumors everywhere, threatening the masses, saying that whoever didn't join the army would have their head cut off, in order to undermine the conscription work. These conspiracies were successively exposed by the masses and struggles were launched. In Liangbin Township, Dongtai, feudal rich peasant Yin Chuyu sent his son to the army three times, but was rejected each time. The first time he asked his eldest son to sign up, the masses said: "He is a rich peasant, and he used to do business and ran to the strongholds. His background is unclear. This kind of person is not qualified to be a New Fourth Army soldier." The second time, he asked to stay as a cook, and the masses said: "Coming once and coming twice, it's nothing more than wanting to be a bomb shelter. The food all passes through the cook's hands, we don't trust him." The third time, he switched to signing up his second son, but was also rejected.

    审查入伍资格
    【新华社华东十九日电】苏中群众严格审查参军入伍资格，以保证人民武装的纯洁。东台三仓乡地主林成余在大会上替儿子报名参军后，立即威胁贫雇农说：“我也是军属了，你们赶快送慰劳，还要准备明年送租粮。”宝应邵庄封建富农杨有三假报名参军，并说要动员十二人入伍，到处造谣，威胁群众，说那个不去参军，就杀那个的头，以破坏参军工作。此种阴谋均先后为群众揭破，并开展斗争。东台梁滨乡封建富农殷楚余，三次送子入伍，均被退回，第一次叫长子报名，群众说：“他是富农，而且过去做生意，跑据点，面目不清，这种人没有资格当新四军。”第二次又要求留下当伙夫，群众说：“一次来两次来，无非想做个防空洞，吃的东西都经伙夫的手，我们不放心。”第三次换次子报名，亦被拒绝。
