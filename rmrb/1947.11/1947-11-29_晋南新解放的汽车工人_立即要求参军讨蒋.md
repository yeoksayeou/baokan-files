　　Newly Liberated Automobile Workers in Southern Shanxi
    Immediately Request to Join the Army to Fight Chiang
    [This newspaper's Southern Shanxi Front dispatch, 27th] Automobile workers Fan Kejun and Fan Yinsheng from Chiang's Sixth Automobile Regiment, and automobile worker Feng Hanqiu from the Thirteenth Automobile Regiment, after being liberated by us in this Southern Shanxi Campaign, only lived in the liberated area for two days, and they already realized that the liberated area is the home of the working class, and they asked for work. They excitedly said, "We have returned to our home." Fan Yinsheng said, "Under Chiang Kai-shek, we earned very little money, and were also exploited by the officers... After being liberated, upon stating that we were automobile workers, the People's Liberation Army soldiers immediately gave us steamed buns to eat." Feng Hanqiu hurriedly interjected, explaining the People's Liberation Army commanders and fighters' love for the workers, he said, "A company commander of the People's Liberation Army, knowing that we were workers, wanted to carry our luggage for us. If it were Chiang Kai-shek, he would not only not carry our luggage, but would give us two slaps." As he spoke, he took out a three-inch-long blue driving permit from his pocket, with the name Chen Jiye written on it. He took off his hat, pointed to the picture on it and said, "Let me tell you a story. Before April last year, I was still driving commercial vehicles in Chongqing. The Xinhua Daily was the most supportive of workers' welfare, so I liked to read it the most. As a result, I was arrested by Chiang Kai-shek's police, stayed in prison for a month, suffered the pain of unemployment, and only then did I change my name to Chen Jiye in disguise, and joined Chiang's army to drive cars. Now it's good, I'm back to the workers' home, it's so good, I'm free!" They unanimously requested: "When giving us work, assign us to serve in the People's Liberation Army's motorcade and fight back to the South."

　　晋南新解放的汽车工人
    立即要求参军讨蒋
    【本报晋南前线二十七日电】蒋军汽六团汽车工人范克竣范寅生，汽十三团汽车工人冯汉秋等，在此次晋南战役中被我解放后，刚到解放区生活了两天，他们便已认识到解放区是工人阶级的家，要求工作，他们兴奋的说：“我们回到自己的家了。”范寅生说：“在蒋介石那里赚很少的钱，还被揩油的长官克扣了。……被解放以后，说明是汽车工人，人民战士立即拿馒头分给我们吃。”冯汉秋急忙插嘴，说明人民解放军指战员的热爱工人，他说：“人民解放军的一位连长，知道我们是工人，就要为我们扛行李，要是蒋介石不但不会为我们扛行李，倒会打两个耳光。”他边说边从衣袋掏出一张三寸长的蓝皮开车证，上面写着陈继业，他摘下帽子指着上面的像片说：“我说给你一个故事听，去年四月以前，我还是在重庆开商车，新华日报是最拥护工人福利的，所以我也最喜欢看，结果被蒋介石的警察抓起来，住了一个月监狱，受着失业的痛苦，才隐姓埋名改名陈继业，参加了蒋军开汽车。现在好了，回到工人的家，可好啦，自由啦！”他们一致要求：“给我们工作时，派到人民解放军的汽车队服务，打回南方去。”
