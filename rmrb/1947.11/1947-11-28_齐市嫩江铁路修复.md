Northeast Construction

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 25th: The Ningnian-Nenjiang section of the railway was connected at Yilaha on the 9th of this month, and a grand opening ceremony was held in Nenjiang City on the 20th. Mixed trains will run daily between Qiqihar and Nenjiang, once in each direction. The line is 182 kilometers long, and construction began simultaneously from the north and south on September 1st. Station buildings, telecommunications, and water supply facilities along the line have been rebuilt. In the past two and a half months, thanks to the high labor enthusiasm of the employees and the active assistance of the liberated peasants, various difficulties have been overcome. For example, when building the 225-meter-long Nemor River Bridge, it rained for 13 days in one month, but the employees persisted in their work. The liberated peasants donated one-third of the engineering materials and spared manpower from their busy autumn harvest to build, ensuring the successful completion of the project on schedule.
    
　　Furthermore, the employees of all departments and stations under the Qiqihar Railway Bureau are actively preparing for the major task of winter transportation. They have begun to build the necessary tools and equipment for winter transportation. Workers in the boiler room of the Qiqihar Railway Factory designed and installed a large boiler in 37 days, which would have taken three months to repair during the puppet Manchukuo period, ensuring the warmth of the locomotive depot. In order to ensure the safety of winter transportation, the Qiqihar Railway Telecommunications Section began repairing the telephones at each station on the 20th of last month. Workers such as Yin Zuomin of the Qiqihar Railway Factory collected waste materials and repaired an electric planer, making a great contribution to winter transportation. Currently, the factory is widely launching a campaign to make contributions to winter transportation.

　　齐市嫩江铁路修复
    【新华社东北二十五日电】宁年嫩江段铁路，已于本月九日在伊拉哈接轨，廿日在嫩江城隆重举行通车典礼，每日将由齐齐哈尔、嫩江两地，南北对开一次混合车。该线全长一百八十二公里，自九月一日南北同时兴工，沿线站房、电讯及给水设施，均重新建筑。两月半来，由于员工的高度劳动热忱，与翻身农民的积极帮助，克服了种种困难。如在修筑二百二十五米长的讷谟尔河桥时，一月中有十三天下雨，员工均坚持工作，翻身农民捐献了三分之一的工程材料，并于繁忙的秋收打场中，抽出人工修建，使该工程胜利地如期完成。
    又讯：齐齐哈尔铁路管理局所属各部，各站员工积极迎接冬季运输的重大任务，已开始修筑冬运时必需的工具与设备，齐铁工厂暖房工人，在三十七天中自己设计与装置伪满时需三月始能修竣之大锅，保证机车库的温暖。齐铁电务段为保证冬运安全，自上月二十日开始修理各站电话。齐铁工厂工人尹作民等，曾搜集废器材，修好电刨床，对冬运贡献极大。现该厂正普遍掀起冬运的立功竞赛。
