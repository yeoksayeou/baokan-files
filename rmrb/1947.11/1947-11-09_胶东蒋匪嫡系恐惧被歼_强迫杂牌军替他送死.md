Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 4th: During Chiang Kai-shek's invasion of Jiaodong, he more openly forced miscellaneous troops to die for him, resulting in the heaviest losses for these troops. When Chiang's troops attacked Pingdu, Chiang's direct lineage 9th Division stayed at the rear, while the direct lineage 54th Division acted as the right flank along the Jiao (county)-Ping (du) highway. They forced the miscellaneous 25th Division (composed of troops from the Northwest Army, Northeast Army, and Sichuan Army) to attack Pingdu head-on. The 9th and 54th Divisions not only flanked the 25th Division but also supervised the battle from behind. Only when Pingdu was about to fall did the 9th Division follow. After advancing to Guojia Village (more than 70 li northeast of Pingdu), to avoid the direct lineage troops being pressured by the People's Liberation Army from the east, they again used the 25th Division as the right flank. When invading Louling and Fushan from Laiyang, they also sandwiched the 25th Division in the middle to block the front. Now the 54th Division has fled back to Laiyang, and the 8th Division has shrunk westward, leaving a part of the 25th Division isolated in Yantai, waiting for the People's Liberation Army to annihilate them at any time. Furthermore, during the Changyi South campaign, when the 9th Division fled, it stopped as soon as it detected the People's Liberation Army's main force, refusing to advance. The two brigades of the Gui-lineage miscellaneous 64th Division, originally responsible for the Jiaoji eastern section's defense south of Pingdu, were sent to clear the way in the Sanhu Mountain and Fanjiagji area (40 li southeast of Changyi). As a result, the 64th Division was immediately delivered into the People's Liberation Army's pocket. When the 64th Division was surrounded and annihilated, the 9th Division, although nearby, did not come to the rescue. Instead, it ordered the miscellaneous 45th Division (old Northeast Army), which was far away in Weixian and Changle, to rush to the rescue. The 211th Brigade of the 45th Division was completely caught in the net as soon as it reached the Shanyangzhuang area (40 li south of Changyi), and even the newly appointed Brigade Commander Zhang Zhongzhong was captured alive. In this campaign, the miscellaneous 64th Division lost two-thirds of its strength, and the miscellaneous 45th Division also lost more than one-third, basically losing their combat effectiveness.

    胶东蒋匪嫡系恐惧被歼
    强迫杂牌军替他送死
    【新华社华东前线四日电】蒋贼在进犯胶东的战斗中，更加露骨的迫使杂牌军替他送死，致各杂牌军遭受损失最重。当蒋匪进攻平度时，蒋嫡系九师在最后，嫡系五四师沿胶（县）平（度）公路为右翼，却拿杂牌二五师（由西北军、东北军及川军合编而成）正面攻平度，九师、五四师不但夹着二五师，并在后面督战，直到即将侵陷平度时，九师才跟上去。北进至郭家店后（平度东北七十余里）为免嫡系受到解放军东面的压力，又以二五师为右翼，由莱阳进犯楼灵、福山时，也是把二五师夹在当中挡正面，现在五四师已逃回莱阳，八师往西收缩，又留二五师一部孤军困守烟台，坐待解放军随时可以到来的歼灭打击，又昌（邑）南战役中，九师逃走时，一发现解放军主力即停脚不进，而今原在平度以南担任胶济东段守备之桂系杂牌军六四师两个旅往三户山、范家集（昌邑东南四十里）一带开路，结果一下子就把六四师送进了解放军的口袋里。六四师被围歼时，九师虽近在咫尺，也见死不救，反使远在潍县、昌乐等地之杂牌四五师（旧东北军）驰援，四五师二一一旅刚走到山阳庄（在昌邑南四十余里）一带就全部落网，连上任不久的旅长张中忠也被生擒了。这次战役，杂牌六四师损失了三分之二，杂牌四五师也损失了三分之一以上，基本上都已失去了战斗力。
