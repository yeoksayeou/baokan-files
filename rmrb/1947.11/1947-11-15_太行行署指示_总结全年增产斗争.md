Taihang Administrative Office Directive
    Summarize the Year's Production Increase Struggle
    [This newspaper's Taihang dispatch of the 13th] The Taihang Administrative Office issued a directive on the 8th of this month to summarize the year's production. The directive pointed out: Taihang's production this year overcame many difficulties amidst substantial support for the front, the thorough implementation of land reform, and the struggle against drought, and thus achieved great results. All regions should earnestly summarize this. It then put forward the following points for summarizing the content and methods:

    (1) Summarize the production increase struggle, focusing on agriculture: This year, we suffered continuous and severe natural disasters such as severe drought, wind, and hail. The Taihang Party and government called for overcoming the disaster and struggling for increased agricultural production in every way. We should summarize the degree to which this policy was implemented and the experience of the struggle. Calculate the actual harvest of various production increases from the results. Study the main keys to production increase in different regions, how the leadership grasped and organized the production increase struggle, and systematically summarize all the creations of the masses in drought resistance and production increase, to serve as practical knowledge for future production increase direction and agricultural technical guidance. This is of particular significance to the Taihang area, which experiences "nine droughts in ten years." Secondly, in terms of cooperation, textiles, and various sideline handicraft production, we should summarize from the perspective of benefiting agricultural development and the interests of emancipated poor and hired peasants. This is the basic standard for specifically examining the direction of sideline occupations and testing achievements. After the production summary, it is necessary to calculate the people's living gains and losses. In addition to comprehensive overall calculations, the lives of the poor and hired peasants should be accurately calculated. Those who are self-sufficient or have a surplus in production should immediately plan for development and expand production. Those who do not have enough production should immediately plan how to make up for the deficit and organize production to overcome the famine.

    (2) Summarize the work of "organizing": The basic focus of the summary should be to examine the class line running through mutual assistance in agriculture and sideline industries. First, from the aspects of equivalent value, wages, and profit sharing in agriculture and sideline industries in mutual aid policies, carefully calculate the comparative advantages and disadvantages of each class. Secondly, calculate the proportion of benefits gained by each class from the effects of being organized (such as rushing work to save labor and increasing production). Then, conduct research from the perspective of the composition of the village-level leadership that determines mutual aid policies. In order to correctly understand what class foundation the grassroots production organization and leadership are in various places. In addition, this year, through mutual assistance, there have been new creations in expanding the scope of labor exchange (such as the combination of agriculture and sideline occupations, war service, and the organization of auxiliary labor). We must conduct analysis and research on the forms and systems of combination, and draw correct conclusions from the actual interests of the poor and hired peasants. Summarizing the experience of mutual assistance should be linked to rectifying and transforming mutual assistance organizations and village-level leadership, and implement the organizational line of the poor and hired peasants controlling power in light of the actual situation.

    (3) Summarize the organization and leadership of the production movement: Summarize our leadership thinking and methods from every aspect and every movement of large-scale production. This requires finding out why certain production tasks can truly form a mass movement and achieve success, and what are the reasons for the leadership? At the same time, it should also examine why certain production tasks become formalistic and lead to failure, and what are the reasons for the leadership? The basic focus of summarizing leadership should be based on the class situation of the local land reform mass mobilization, which is manifested in the new class content and class trends in this year's production movement, and how our leadership has grasped this characteristic, and what problems exist in understanding and guiding the route. In addition, in the summary of leadership, attention should be paid to discovering more exemplary departments and individuals in terms of route and style, and appropriate commendations should be made as specific examples for educating cadres.

    (4) Border areas: In addition to referring to the above content, the focus should be on summarizing the experience of combining production in the border areas (or guerrilla areas) with the development of guerrilla warfare and the thorough implementation of the land reform land distribution struggle, and systematically summarizing the implementation experience of implementing the combination of labor and military, and the organizational forms and specific policies of the rear support for the border areas.

### 太行行署指示  总结全年增产斗争

　　太行行署指示
    总结全年增产斗争
    【本报太行十三日电】太行行署本月八日发出总结全年生产的指示，该指示指出：太行今年生产，在大量支前及贯澈土改，与旱灾斗争中，克服了许多困难，才取得很大成绩，各地应认真加以总结。随即提出如下几点总结内容与方法：
    （一）总结以农业为主的增产斗争：今年连续遭酷旱、风、雹等严重的自然灾害，太行党与政府，曾号召战胜灾荒，一切为农业增产而斗争。我们应该总结这一方针的执行程度与斗争经验，从结果上计算各项增产的实际收获，研究不同地区增产主要关键，领导上如何掌握与组织了增产斗争，并系统总结群众在抗旱增产中的一切创造，以作为今后增产方向与农事技术指导的实际知识。这对于“十年九旱”的太行区是有特殊意义的。其次，在合作、纺织及各种副业手工业生产方面，应从有利于发展农业与翻身贫雇的利益上进行总结，这是具体检查副业方向与考验成绩的基本标准。经过生产总结，要计算人民生活的盈亏，除了全面的综合计算外，并应精确计算贫雇的生活。凡是生产自足或有余的，应即计划发展，扩大生产。生产不足的，应即计划如何弥补亏空，组织生产度荒。
    （二）总结“组织起来”工作：总结的基本着眼点，应是检查贯串于农副业互助中的阶级路线。首先从互助政策上之等价，工资及农副业分红等方面，精细计算各阶层的利害比较。其次是从组织起来的效果上（如赶工省工，增产等）计算各阶层得利的比重。然后从决定互助政策的村级领导成份上，进行研究。以便正确认识各地基层的生产组织与领导实权是在怎样的阶级基础上。另外，今年经过互助，在扩大劳力交换面上（如农业与副业、战勤相结合及组织辅助劳力等），各地也有新的创造，我们要从结合形式与制度上，进行分析研究，并从贫雇的实际利益上，得出正确的结论。总结互助经验，应与整顿改造互助组织与村级领导连系起来，针对实际情况，贯澈贫雇掌权的组织路线。
    （三）总结生产运动的组织领导：从大生产的每个方面及每一个运动中，总结我们的领导思想与方法。这就需要找出某些生产任务所以能真正形成群众性的运动，而得到成功，其领导的原因是什么？同时也应检查某些生产任务流为形式而招致失败，其领导的原因又是什么？总结领导的基本着眼点，应根据当地土改大发动的阶级状况，也就是表现在今年生产运动中新的阶级内容与阶级动向，我们领导上如何掌握了这个特点，在认识与指导路线上存在着什么问题。另外，在总结领导中，应注意发现路线与作风上较为模范的部门与个人，进行适当的表扬，以作为教育干部的具体榜样。
    （四）边沿地区：除参考以上各项内容外，应着重总结边地（或游击区）生产与开展游击战争及贯澈土改分田斗争的结合经验，并系统的总结执行劳武结合，后方支援边地的组织形式与具体政策的实施经验。
