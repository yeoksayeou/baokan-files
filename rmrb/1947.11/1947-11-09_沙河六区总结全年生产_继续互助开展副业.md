    Shahe Sixth District Summarizes Year-Round Production; Continues Mutual Aid to Develop Sideline Occupations
    [This newspaper's Shahe news] At the Sixth District's year-round production summary meeting, after more than two days of comparing working time and summarizing production achievements, each village recognized that the purpose of winning the flag was to become wealthy. This year, the entire district planted seasonal wheat, and they planted a lot of it, so next year they will be able to eat more white steamed buns. Therefore, whoever wins the flag will naturally be greatly glorified, but those who do not win the flag should not be discouraged. The masses of Nanwang and Wan villages said, "We have all planted wheat well this year, so even if we lose the flag to them, we will still benefit and be satisfied!" In the future, model villagers will be selected and merits will be evaluated. People and groups will compare with each other. Xi Cui was divided into four groups again. Guo Jiangui and Zhu Desheng (two hired laborers) said, "This election is not simple. You have to look at class background, history, and this year's achievements in leading the masses in production. You can't be careless!" The village selections are very cautious, because they have all carried out merit-based movements in their own villages, and it is generally clear who should be credited, so among the eighty people selected for first-class merit and one hundred and twenty for second-class merit, a total of 169 were poor and hired laborers. After the model meritorious figures were selected, they were evaluated again according to the results of the autumn harvest and wheat planting movement. Each village completed it on time and exceeded the original plan. No one knocked down anyone in terms of winning or losing, but a comparison was made of the overall work achievements of the whole year, and the four villages of Xi Cui, Putongdian, Zhengzhao, and Xibalizhuang were selected as models for the entire district, and the four award flags from the district were given to them. Everyone said, "Not only is their work good throughout the year, but they also acted as locomotives in the autumn harvest and wheat planting, leading the entire district. They were selected as models this time. We will see when they engage in sideline occupations this winter, and we will definitely surpass them!" The leadership seized the opportunity to strike while the iron was hot and let everyone brew the problem of winter production. After starting to compare working time, individual cadres who had been thoroughly liberated believed that they had harvested grain this year and could have a good couple of days. The leadership emphasized again, "We have only just turned ourselves around. Although we have harvested some grain, we still don't have a foundation. Our homes are still empty. Everyone should take a look and see what difficulties there are in production? Are there any holes?" After the group calculated the accounts, Zhao Sisui and Li Zhanzong said at the meeting, "This year I harvested twenty-two bags of grain. According to the old days, that would be extremely rich, but now that we have turned ourselves around, we have to say it as a turn around. We can't waste it either. Calculate half a catty of rice per person per meal. We have cotton for clothing, and we can spin and weave ourselves without accounting. Dyeing cloth will cost several thousand yuan. We don't dare to arrange other furniture. We have to buy hoes and iron shovels, and the divided waterwheel, the buckets are broken, and the frame needs to be repaired. Even if we eat a little less, we have to take care of it. If it can't be repaired, even if we plant wheat this year, we won't be able to water it next year. All in all, it will cost forty bags of grain a year, not to mention buying livestock!" After calculating the accounts one by one like this, most of the people who had not calculated carefully were shocked, and even those who were still paralyzed began to calculate carefully. Li Hongzhi of Xi Cui said, "In previous years, I only harvested two or three bags, but this year I harvested seventeen bags, and I planted a lot of wheat. I just felt very good. I thought I should take a good rest for two days, but after careful calculation, it's still a lot short! I can't rest, I have to work hard this winter!" After breaking the paralysis, they discussed how to engage in winter production to make up for the holes. Wei Si of Nanwang Village said, "In winter, people with skills and abilities can make money. They should lead those who don't have the skills to work together and share the money!" Wei Wen said, "Those with great skills can carry a rake outside and earn a lot of money, those with little skills can earn a little money, and those without skills can carry a manure basket to collect manure, which is also helpful. Those at home and outside have to be organized, and they can't do it without being organized." Because the liberated masses urgently demanded to become wealthy, but there are still difficulties on the road to becoming wealthy, and at the same time, they have a deeper understanding of the benefits of mutual aid in the autumn harvest and wheat planting, so the masses' demands for organization are still very urgent. They unanimously believe that they still need to organize this winter to engage in sideline occupations. Do whatever you can do, and the Eight Immortals will cross the sea, each showing their talents, so that they can solve the problem. The most important urgent demand of the masses in becoming wealthy is to increase livestock, fill waterwheels, and collect fertilizer. They said, "It is not easy to grow well in watered land without livestock and waterwheels, and it is difficult to grow without fertilizer. Livestock, waterwheels, and fertilizer are the capital for us to eat white noodles and become rich next year!" Therefore, it was decided that the purpose of this year's winter production is mainly to prepare conditions and lay the foundation for next year's agricultural production, and then put forward the slogan: "No idlers in the village, those who can eat meat eat meat, and those who can't eat meat can nibble on bones and drink mutton soup!" In short, everyone moves and everyone gets rich. Finally, each village formulated a winter production plan based on the specific conditions and actual strength of their own village. The total plan for the entire district is as follows: 1. Agricultural production: Before October 15th, wheat was universally applied with winter water. By the end of the year, the entire district will accumulate 30,000 large carts of fertilizer, and 13 villages plan to reclaim 1,030 mu of wasteland (including leveling ditches and trenches), and plant 106,000 trees. 2. Establish an agricultural tool cooperative: Repair 253 old waterwheels, increase 7,860 new waterwheel buckets. According to the calculation of 40 buckets for each waterwheel, it can be exchanged for 196 complete waterwheels. Seven villages plan to manufacture and buy 18 new waterwheels. 3. Handicraft industry: There are 4,943 spinning women in the entire district (incomplete). Universally develop accelerated spinning wheels and organize them. By the end of the year, 114,000 catties of thread can be spun, which can earn 800,000 catties of rice. Other weaving mats, woodworking and blacksmithing, various workshops and transportation, etc., according to incomplete statistics, can earn more than 76 million foreign yuan. 4. Add livestock: Seven villages plan to buy 23 mules, 16 villages plan to buy 234 cattle and donkeys, and 14 villages plan to exchange 176 inferior livestock for good livestock. Finally, everyone put forward a competition. The next meeting will compare who earns more money and whose livestock are better and more numerous, and then see who wins and loses.

    沙河六区总结全年生产
    继续互助开展副业
    【本报沙河讯】六区全年生产总结大会上，经过两天多的比时光，和总结生产成绩后，各村都认识了夺旗的目的是为了发家致富，今年全区都种上了应时麦子，种的又多，明年就能多吃白馍馍。因此谁要得了旗，自然是大光荣，但不得旗的也不要泄气，南汪、万村群众说：“咱们今年都把麦子种好了，就是输给他们旗，咱也得了利，合了适！”以后分村评选模范，评功，人与人，组与组都互相比较，西崔又分成了四个小组，郭建贵和朱得生（两个雇工）说：“这个选举可不简单，要看成份，又要看历史，还要看今年领导群众生产的成绩，可不能马虎！”各村评选都很慎重，因为都已在本村搞过了立功运动，一般明确给谁立功，所以选出的头等功八十人，和二等功一百二十名中，共计贫雇占一百六十九人。选出模范立功人物后，就又按联防评议秋收种麦运动的竞赛结果，各个村都按时间完成，而且超过了原订计划，论输赢谁也没搬倒谁，但从全年的全面工作成绩上又进行了比较，选出西崔、普通店、正招、西八里庄四村为全区模范，把区上的四面奖旗给了他们，大家说：“他们不但全年的工作好，在秋收种麦中也当了火车头，带领了全区，这次他们当了模范，冬天搞副业咱们再看，非超过他们不行！”领导上就抓紧趁热打铁，让大家酝酿了冬季生产问题。开始比了时光后，个别翻透身的干部，认为今年打下了粮食，可该好过两天了。领导上又着重指出说：“咱们现在才翻了身，虽然打下了些粮食，可是咱还没有底儿，家里都还是空的，大家都要看看，在生产上还有些什么困难？有窟窿没有？”经过小组的算帐以后，赵泗水、李占宗在大会上发言说：“今年我打了二十二布袋粮食，按过去的旧光景说，就是顶富足了，但是现在翻了身，就得按翻身说，咱也不能浪费，每人每顿按吃半斤米算，穿衣裳有了棉花，自纺自织不打帐，染布就得几千块，别的家具咱也不敢张罗，锄和铁锨得置买，还有分下的水车，斗子都坏了，架子也需要修，那怕吃赖点，也得收拾，如果修不好，别看今年种上了麦子，明年不能浇还是打不下，总共算计下来，一年得开支四十布袋粮食，别说再买牲口了！”这样一宗一宗的算帐以后，大部分没有细算帐的人都大吃了一惊，还在麻痹的人，也都仔细的算起帐来，西崔李洪志说：“往常年我才打两三布袋，今年打了十七布袋，麦子也种的不少，就是觉着很不错了，我想可该好好歇两天了，但是仔细算了算帐，可还差的多哩！不能歇，冬天还得大搞搞啦！”打破了麻痹思想后，就讨论怎样搞冬季生产补窟窿？南汪村魏思说：“冬天里有手艺和本事大的人能赚钱，他们应当带领没本事的，伙做活儿伙分钱！”魏文说：“本事大的扛上个筢子到外边往回搂，赚大钱，本事小的赚小钱，没本事的背上个粪篓拾粪，也顶事，在家的和外的还得组织起来，不组织起来就不能干。”因为翻身群众迫切要求发家，但在发家道路上还有困难，同时在秋收种麦中更深刻的认识了互助的好处，所以群众对组织起来的要求还是十分迫切的，一致认为今年冬天还需要组织起来搞副业，能干啥就干啥，八仙过海各显其能，这样才能解决问题。群众在发家中的迫切要求最主要的又是增加牲口，填制水车，和集肥，他们说：“水地没有牲口和水车就不容易种好，没有肥料也难长起来，牲口、水车、肥料，就是咱明年吃白面和发家致富的本钱！”因此决定今年的冬季生产目的，主要是给明年的农业生产准备条件，打下基础，随即提出口号：“村村没闲人，能吃肉的吃肉，不能吃肉就啃骨喝羊汤！”总之，大家都动弹都发财，最后各村根据自己村的具体情况和实际力量，订出了冬季生产计划。总计全区计划如下：一、农业生产：十月十五以前麦子普遍上完冻水，全区到年底共积肥三万大车，十三个村计划开荒一千零三十亩，（连平毁沟壕在内），种树十万六千棵。二、成立农具合作社：修理旧水车二百五十三辆，增加新水车斗子七千八百六十个，按每辆水车补四十个斗子计，可换成完整水车一百九十六辆，七个村计划制买新水车十八辆。三、手工业：全区纺妇四千九百四十三人（不完全），普遍发展加速轮纺车，并且组织起来，到年底可纺线十一万四千斤，能赚米八十万斤，其他编席、木铁匠、各种作坊及运输等，据不完全的统计，共可赚洋七千六百余万元。四、添买牲口：计七个村买骡子二十三个，十六村买牛驴二百三十四个，十四村赖牲口换好牲口一百七十六个。最后大家又提出竞赛，下次开会要比较，看谁赚的钱多，谁的牲口好、多，再见输赢。（政民、高孟、奎林）
