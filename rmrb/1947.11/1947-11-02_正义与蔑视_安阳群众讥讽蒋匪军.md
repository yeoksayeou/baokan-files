    Justice and Contempt
    The People of Anyang Mock the Chiang Bandit Troops
    Ma Lin

    I. "Even if you shoot me, you're still far worse than the Eighth Route Army!"

    In Zhangjia Village (which the enemy calls a controlled area), a Chiang bandit soldier robbed an old woman of 10,000 yuan. The old woman immediately shouted and went to find the company commander.

    The company commander asked, "Which one was it?" He originally thought the old woman wouldn't dare to identify him, hoping to turn the tables.

    But the old woman finally recognized him, and the company commander searched the soldier, luckily finding the money. After counting the bills, he gave the old woman 8,000 yuan. While counting, the old woman said:

    "I say, your army is far worse than the Eighth Route Army! You're so tight-fisted about 10,000 yuan. The Eighth Route Army doesn't even bat an eye at 100,000, 200,000, or 300,000..."

    The company commander raised his pistol and shouted sternly, "If you say another word, I'll shoot you!"

    "Even if you shoot me, you're still far worse than the Eighth Route Army!" the old woman shouted without hesitation.

    II. May I ask, Battalion Commander, do you dare?

    The Chiang bandit army's × Battalion Commander in Anyang city held a meeting in Beiwu Village and said:

    "From now on, anyone who makes contact with the Eighth Route Army or sends them food will be killed!"

    The people who were forcibly brought there said very seriously:

    "Battalion Commander, according to what you say, if the Eighth Route Army comes and says, 'Anyone who makes contact with them or sends them food will be killed,' then you'll have killed all of us!"

    The Battalion Commander fell silent. People pressed him:

    "Please, Battalion Commander, have your troops stay in this village and prevent the Eighth Route Army from coming, and we'll do as you say! May I ask, Battalion Commander, do you dare?"

    The Battalion Commander opened his mouth: "That won't work!"

    "If that won't work, then what do you say we should do?"

    "Offering some minor support is still acceptable, right!"

    This Battalion Commander, who had spoken so fiercely, had no choice but to leave with a red face, while the people scornfully watched him go, cursing under their breath.

    正义与蔑视
    安阳群众讥讽蒋匪军

    一、“枪崩了我你也比八路军差得远哩！”
    安阳城的匪军到了张家庄（敌人称为控制区）一个老太太的一万元被一个蒋匪抢去了，老太太即大喊着去找连长。
    这个连长就问：“是那个人？”他原以为老太太不敢认，想以此来倒打一爪。
    但老太太终于认出来，这位连长就从那个兵的身上搜，可巧就搜出来，把票子点来点去，给了老太太八千元，老太太一边数一边说：
    “我说你们这队伍，比人家八路军可差得远呢！一万也看得这样紧，人家八路军十万、二十万、三十万，也看不到眼里……”
    这位连长把手枪一举，严厉的喊道“你再说，枪崩你！”
    “枪崩了我，你也比八路军差得远呢！”老太太毫不犹豫的喊起来了。
    二、请问营长，你敢不敢？
    安阳城里的蒋匪军×营长到北务村开大会讲话：
    “以后谁要和八路军接头，给八路军送粮食，就杀谁的头！”
    被武装请去的人们很正经的说：
    “营长，照你这样说，如果八路军来了也说：‘谁要给你们接头，送粮食，杀谁的头。’那把我们就杀完了！”
    这位营长就不吭声了，人们追问他：
    “请营长把军队都住到这村，挡住八路军不来，我们就按你的话去办！请问营长，你敢不敢？”
    营长开口了：“那不行！”
    “如果不行，那你说怎么办？”
    “支应支应还是可以的吧！”
    开口很厉害的这位营长没办法，红着脸走了，人们以蔑视的眼光咒骂般的目送着他。
