Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th - An Associated Press reporter reported from Shanghai on the 3rd that "foreign (referring to American) military personnel" residing in Shanghai admitted that the Chinese People's Liberation Army "has surpassed the initial advantage held by the Kuomintang army due to its greater firepower and newer weapons." They admitted that "the government (referring to the Chiang bandits) army has been forced into a defensive posture by the Communist army (referring to the People's Liberation Army) on at least six battlefields," namely: First, "Northeast China: Jilin, Changchun, and the Xiaofengman Dam are facing danger"; Second, "Shaanxi Province: The Communist army has surrounded Yan'an on three sides, threatening Yulin in the north," "Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng Dehuai has led troops back to the front of Yan'an"; Third, "Shandong Peninsula: Yantai and other naval bases occupied by the government (Chiang bandits) are being shaken by guerrilla resistance in the province's interior"; Fourth, "The area around Hankou: The Communist's outstanding general Liu Bocheng is 'disturbing' the upper reaches of the Yangtze River"; Fifth, "Near Baoding and Shijiazhuang: The Communist army has been very active in the past two weeks"; Sixth, "Guangdong Province: The 'remnants' of the Communist Dongjiang Column continue to 'disturb' the Kuomintang army, causing frequent civil uprisings in South China." These "foreign military personnel" stated that the advantages of the People's Liberation Army are "the effective use of weapons and swift and skillful strikes against the enemy," and that the People's Liberation Army has won "the advantage of mobile strike power." The Associated Press stated: "Travelers returning from Communist areas (referring to the Liberated Areas) say that the morale of the Communists is unprecedentedly high. The army still eats well, dresses well, and wins weapons and ammunition from the Kuomintang army on the battlefield every day."

    寓沪美国军事人士承认
    解放军各线皆占优势
    【新华社陕北五日电】美联社记者三日自上海报导，寓沪“外国（按指美军）军事人士”承认，目前中国人民解放军“已胜过国民党军最初由于拥有较大火力与较新武器而拥有的优势”。他们承认“政府（指蒋匪）军至少在六个战场上被迫而防阻着共军（指解放军）”，即，第一、“东北方面：吉林、长春、小丰满水闸，已面临危险”；第二、“陕西省：共产党军已三面包围延安，威胁北部的榆林”，“彭德怀副总司令已带领军队回到了延安门前”；第三、“山东半岛：政府（蒋匪）踞有的烟台及其他海军基地，正受着该省内地游击抵抗的震荡”；第四、“汉口周围地区：共产党出色的将军刘伯承正‘滋扰’着长江上游”；第五、“保定和石家庄附近：过去两周共军甚为活跃”；第六、“广东省：共产党东江纵队‘残部’继续‘滋扰’国民党军，致使华南民变时有所闻”。这些“外国军事人士”称，人民解放军的优点是“有效的使用武器，与迅速而巧妙的打击敌方”，人民解放军已赢得“打击力量的优势机动性”。美联社称：“从共产党地区（指解放区）归来的旅客说：共产党的士气空前高昂。军队仍然吃的好，穿得好，每天在战场上从国民党军那里赢得武器和军火。”
