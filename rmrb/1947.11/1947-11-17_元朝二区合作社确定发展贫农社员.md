　　[Report from This Newspaper in Jinnan, 15th] The Second District of Yuan Dynasty recently held a joint meeting of village cooperative chairmen to discuss how cooperatives can serve poor peasants. The district has a total of six cooperatives: Jinnan Cooperative, Jintan Town Exchange Masses Cooperative, Jinbei Cooperative, Dongsuozhuang Cooperative, Housizhuang Cooperative, and Niangniangmiao Minyi Cooperative. More than ten people attended. Everyone discussed that the nature of cooperatives is to serve the masses, not to be stores, and decided to make poor peasant members the backbone of the cooperative and develop poor peasant members. In the past, it was only known that making money was serving the masses, but the rich contributed more shares, while the poor had not yet contributed shares, so the poor could not benefit. After discussion, everyone clarified their position and decided to handle businesses needed by the poor, and to educate poor peasant members to make them the backbone, let them know the benefits of expanding the cooperative for them, solicit opinions from poor cooperative members, explaining that the cooperative will serve the poor in the future, and the cooperative will solve difficulties, and the poor peasants should supervise. The staff of the cooperative should squeeze out the landlords and rich peasants, and not allow landlords and rich peasants to speculate within the cooperative.

　　元朝二区合作社确定发展贫农社员
    【本报冀南十五日电】元朝二区于目前召开村合作社长联席会，讨论合作社如何为贫农服务。全区共六个合作社，有金南社、金滩镇交易所群众社、金北社、东索庄社、后寺庄社、娘娘庙民益社，到会十余人。大家讨论了合作社性质是为群众服务，不是商店，决定以贫苦社员为合作社骨干，发展贫农社员。过去只知道赚钱就是为群众服务，可是富者入的股多，穷者还没有入股的，这样穷人就得不到好处。经过讨论后，大家明确了立场，回去决意要办穷人所需要的营业，并教育贫农社员，使之为骨干，叫他知道扩大合作社对他们的好处，并征求贫社员意见，说明合作社以后给穷人办事，困难由合作社解决，要贫农监督。合作社职工，把地主富农成份挤出去，不让地主富农在合作社内投机。
