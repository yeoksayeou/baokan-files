　　Major Meetings, Small Groups, Repeated Discussions, Full Mobilization
  　Young and Middle-Aged Men in Southern Hebei Compete to Enlist
    [Our Newspaper, Southern Hebei, 25th Dispatch] The masses in Southern Hebei are enthusiastically joining the army. In just half a month, more than 8,000 young and middle-aged men from Wei and Wei counties alone have bravely enlisted. Anti-offensive companies have been established in villages and towns such as Shaogu, Qiji, Xueta, and Sizhuang in Wei County. Nangong and Qinghe are also experiencing a surge of enthusiasm, with village cadres and Party members signing up to join the army one after another. Currently, 160 village cadres and Party members in Nangong have signed up. This time, full ideological mobilization was carried out in advance. For example, in Wei County, mobilization through major meetings, small group meetings, and family meetings was carried out universally, along with repeated discussions. From the beginning, the slogan "Expand ourselves, expand our relatives" was loudly proclaimed, resulting in many commendable and exemplary cases. For example, parents sending their sons, wives sending their husbands, brothers vying with each other, and so on, can be heard everywhere. Zhai Maopin from Xueta Town personally sent four sons to join the army. Yang Weifu, Zhai Qimao, and Wang Zhongxin also competed to send their sons, and four young women also competed to send their husbands. The militia captain led the entire militia to join the army. The town was filled with shouts of "Capture Chiang Kai-shek alive!" Sheng Guangde, a revolutionary martyr's family member from Qian Damoli in the Second District of Wei County, shouted at a meeting of more than 2,000 male and female village cadres: "My eldest son died at the hands of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. The hatred for killing my son will never be forgotten. I will let my youngest son go and capture Chiang Kai-shek to avenge his brother." At a meeting of 500 village cadres in the Sixth District of Nangong, an old Communist Party member with white hair, Liu Chenglin, shouted: "Don't laugh at me for being old and having a long beard. I have a handsome young son. I will let my son go and fight Chiang Kai-shek. He will be a good soldier." This won warm applause from everyone. Such exemplary actions are emerging everywhere in various regions, too numerous to mention.

    【本报冀南二十五日电】冀南群众热烈参军，半月中仅威、魏两县即有八千余青壮年英勇入伍。威县邵固、七级、雪塔、寺庄等村镇都成立了反攻连。南宫、清河也势如潮涌，村干党员纷纷报名参军，刻下南宫已有百六十名村干、党员报名。此次参军事先充分的作了思想动员，如威县普遍的进行了大会、小组会、家庭会的动员和反复的讨论，一开始就响亮的提出了“自己扩自己，亲人扩亲人”的口号，因此涌现出很多可歌可颂的模范例子。如象父母送子，妻子送郎，兄争弟不让等等事迹，处处可闻。雪塔镇翟茂品亲送四子参军。杨伟福、翟奇茂、王忠信也争着送子，四名青年妇女也争着送郎，民兵队长就率领着全体民兵入伍，该镇洋溢一片活捉蒋介石的呼声。魏县二区前大磨烈属盛光得，在二千多男女村干大会上高呼：“俺大儿死在老蒋的贼手里，杀子之仇是永不会忘的，叫俺这个儿去捉老蒋，好给他哥哥报仇。”南宫六区五百名村干大会上，一位白发苍苍的老共产党员刘成林高呼：“大家别笑我年岁老，胡须长，我有漂亮的年青的儿子，叫我儿去打老蒋，满是个好兵。”博得大家一片热烈的掌声。象这样模范的行动，各地层出不穷，举不胜举。
