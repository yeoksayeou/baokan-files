　　Sizhuang District Summarizes Technical Guidance
  　Commendation of Model Technical Committee Members
    [This Dispatch from Changzhi] The Third District held a central Technical Committee meeting to commend model technical guidance for the entire year. After everyone's deliberation, Niu Renshun, Shen Genzhao, Bao Jinwen, Li Maozhi, Wang Xingsheng, Cui Guiquan, and Zhang Guisheng were nominated as candidates for model technical committee members, and a formal selection will be held next time. The summaries from various villages revealed many model deeds: 1. Going to the countryside with "wozi" (dry rations): Niu Renshun, an expert in cotton planting in Dongcheng, resolved to lead the masses in planting cotton after returning from training at the Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry this spring. He enthusiastically taught cotton planting techniques to the masses in nearby villages, carrying his own "wozi" (steamed cornmeal buns) and traveling to 29 villages in Liling and Liulin in the Third District, as well as Wangtong, Ancheng, and four other villages in the Second District, and Liujiagou in Changzi, Taiyue, spreading technology to a total of 34 villages, spending more than 20 days, and being welcomed by the masses everywhere. 2. Researching cotton planting, turning slopes into plains: The climate in Changzhi is relatively cold, not suitable for cotton planting. In the past, the Yan [Xishan] bandits and the Japanese ordered cotton planting, but without technical guidance, they all failed. However, after Niu Renshun's patient experiments, not afraid of failure, and accepting the experience of Lin County people, he also learned scientific knowledge at the Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry this spring. Under his promotion, the whole village planted a total of 120 mu of cotton. He himself planted 2 mu, which can harvest 60 jin of pure cotton, which can be exchanged for more than 3 shi of rice. His cotton field is on a hillside, where planting grain yields a maximum of 1 shi per mu (equivalent to 6 dou of rice), while cotton can yield 1 shi more rice per mu, equivalent to the yield of a plain. Now almost every family in the village has snow-white cotton drying in their yards. Niu Renshun exchanged cotton for half a donkey, which he has already led home. He said with a smile, "It's really like turning a slope into a plain, planting cotton and leading a donkey!" 3. Only after threshing do you know it's good: The Dongcheng Technical Committee played a great role in promoting improved varieties this year, but some people still didn't believe it. Niu Runze planted more than 2 mu of 811 millet. When harvesting the millet, he felt that the Daqing millet was heavy and hard, which was very good, but the 811 millet had a lot of hair and was light and loose, which didn't look good to him. He was very pessimistic, but after threshing, when he put it into the cloth bag, he smiled. The 811 millet yielded more than 2 shi and 1 dou per mu, while the Daqing millet barely yielded 1 shi per mu. Runze's father said, "I thought I was losing out by planting 811 millet, but who knew I would be convinced after threshing. The 811 millet just has more branches and yields more grain." 4. My mouth, his eyes: Shen Genzhao, a 69-year-old indigo planting expert in Bao Village, said, "This spring, I was asked to be responsible for promoting indigo planting at a meeting in the district. I thought I was old, no good, I couldn't do this. Later, I thought of a way: to teach more apprentices, and let them promote indigo planting. This year, when making indigo, my eyes couldn't see clearly, so I used my mouth to teach the young people how to look at the water. I told them the color of the water, and in this way, I taught five apprentices." 5. I advanced the money, and the masses earned money: Bao Jinwen, the director of the Bao Village Technical Committee, advanced money for poor people to buy cotton seeds when he called for cotton planting this spring. Now that the snow-white cotton has been harvested, they have all made money. Li Heshui, the production director of Sizhuang, said, "I did the same, advancing money for the masses to buy small indigo seeds, and now the masses have all made money." Because of the leadership of the technical committees in various villages, the masses who did not plant special crops this year all regretted saying, "If I had known, I should have listened to the call of the technical committee. Look, those who listened to the call have all made money, and some have even bought livestock."

　　寺庄小区总结技术指导
  　评选模范技术委员
    【本报长治讯】三区召开中心技委会，对全年技术指导进行了评选模范。经过大家酝酿，提出牛仁顺、申根招、鲍进文、李毛只、王兴盛、崔贵全、张贵生等七人为模范技术委员候选人，准备下次正式评选。各村总结中发现不少模范事迹：一、背窝子（干粮）下乡：东呈种棉能手牛仁顺，今春在农林局受训回来就下了决心，要领导群众种花，并按季节到附近村教群众种花技术，工作非常热心，曾背着自己窝子（玉茭面蒸的）前后跑遍三区黎岭、柳林等二十九村，二区王童、安城等四村及太岳长子六家沟，共计传播技术于三十四村，费时在二十天以上，到处受到群众欢迎。二、研究种花，坡地顶平川：长治气候较冷，不适宜种棉，过去阎贼、日本命令种花，也不作技术指导，都失败了。但经牛仁顺耐心试验，不怕失败，接受林县人的经验，今春又在农林局学得了科学知识，在他的推动下，全村共种棉花一百二十亩。他自己就种了二亩，能收净花六十斤，能换米三石多。他的花地是山坡岭地，种谷每亩最高收一石（合米六斗），棉花一亩能多收米一石，可顶上平川地的产量。现在全村差不多家家雪白的棉花都在院内晒着。牛仁顺用棉花换了半个驴，已牵到家里，他笑嘻嘻的说：“真是坡地顶平川，种棉把驴牵！”三、一打场才知好：东呈技委会，今年在推广优良品种上起了很大推动作用，但有部分人还不相信，牛润则种了二亩多八一一谷，割谷时，摸着大青谷又重又硬很好，八一一谷毛多又轻又松，看着不顺眼，他非常悲观，但打了以后，装到布袋里时，他笑了，八一一谷每亩合二石一斗多，而大青谷一亩刚打够一石，润则的爹说：“我还以为种上八一一谷吃了亏，谁知道一打场才叫我服气了，八一一谷就是支杈多，打粮多。”四、我的嘴，他的眼：鲍村种蓝能手申根招，今年六十九岁了，他说：“今春在区开会叫我负责推广种蓝，我想我老了，不行了，不能干这个了。后来想了个办法：要多教几个徒弟，由他们来推动种蓝。今年在打靛时我的眼看不清，就用了我的嘴，来教青年人们看水，我告诉他们水的成色，就这样还教会五个徒弟。”五、我垫了钱，群众赚了钱：鲍村技委会主任鲍进文，今春号召种花时，给贫苦群众垫钱买了花籽，到现在雪白的棉花收回后都赚了钱，寺庄生产主任李何水说：“我也是同样的，给群众垫了小蓝籽钱，到现在群众都赚了钱。”各村由于技委会的领导，今年没种特作物的群众都后悔的说：“早知道可该听技委会的号召，你看人家听了号召都赚了钱，有的买上了牲口。”
