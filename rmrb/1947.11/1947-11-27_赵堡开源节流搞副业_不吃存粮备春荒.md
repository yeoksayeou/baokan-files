　　[Report from our newspaper in Zanhuang] After careful accounting and planning by the masses in Zhaobao, they are striving to achieve "cultivating three years worth of grain, saving one." Before and after the autumn harvest, there was a widespread phenomenon of waste among the cadres and masses in Zhaobao. This autumn's harvest was poor, and relying on a little savings (grain from the fruits of struggle), they ideologically never realized the severity of the famine, and therefore did not prepare for it. For example, village chief Yan Donglai said, "I have three *shi* of old grain, and I can harvest more than two *shi* this autumn. How can three people not finish eating it in a year? My family has to eat a meal of white flour every day!" Turned-over peasant Wang Fusheng also said, "I'm not afraid even if I don't harvest a single grain. I can dig up two loads of white grass on the mountain and exchange it for food. What's there to be afraid of!" After the leadership discovered this problem, they immediately conducted a village-wide accounting. The total grain harvested this autumn in the village, plus the stored grain, minus the burden, leaves a deficit of three months' worth of grain until the end of April next year, based on each person eating three *dou* of grain per month. After this accounting, the cadres and masses were shocked, cleared up their muddled thinking, and recognized the severity of the famine. The production committee immediately convened a meeting of all cadres and mutual aid team leaders to study ways to survive the famine, and also convened a mass meeting, proposing a long-term plan with a distant vision, and formulating a specific plan to strive for "cultivating three years worth of grain, saving one": 1. Organize and systematically accumulate substitute foods; 2. Reduce the standard of living, immediately change food, saving two *he* of grain per person per day, which can save two hundred and forty-four *shi* and eight *dou* of grain in six months in winter and spring, which can increase the village's grain supply by one and a half months. 3. Do not eat the grain you harvest yourself for three months in the winter, relying on sideline production to solve the problem: Women will continue spinning and weaving without stopping in winter and spring, and at the same time organize porterage and transportation. In this way, in addition to making up for the three months of grain shortage, more than seven hundred *shi* of grain can be saved, which is enough for the whole village to eat for four and a half months. Now, the cadres and masses of the whole village are striving to achieve this plan.

　　赵堡开源节流搞副业
  　不吃存粮备春荒
    【本报赞皇讯】赵堡群众经过精确算账订计划，要在渡荒中争取作到耕三余一。秋收前后，赵堡干部群众中普遍存在着浪费现象，今秋年景不好，凭着一点积蓄（斗争果实粮），思想上从未认识到灾荒严重，也就不作渡荒准备，如村长阎东来就说：“我有三石旧粮，今秋还能打两石多（大石），三口人一年怎也吃不完，我家每天要吃顿白面哩”。翻身农民王福生也说：“一颗粮食不收也不怕，上山刨两担白草也能换来饭吃怕啥！”领导上发现了这个问题后，立即进行了全村大算帐。全村今秋收粮加上存粮除去负担，依每人每月吃粮三斗计，到明年四月底尚差三个月粮。经过这一算帐，干部群众大吃一惊，打通了大家的糊涂思想，认识了灾荒的严重。生产委员会立即召集全体干部和互助组长会议，研究渡荒办法，又召集群众大会，提出远处着眼长期打算，订出具体计划，为耕三余一而奋斗：一、组织起来，有计划的积蓄代食品；二、降低生活水平，立即换饭食，每人每日节约二合粮，冬春六个月可省粮二百四十四石八斗、能增加全村一个半月粮。三、冬季三个月不吃自己打的粮，靠副业生产解决：冬春妇女纺织不停工，同时组织挑担运输，这样除可补三个月缺粮外，还能剩粮七百多石，可够全村四个半月吃。现全村干部群众正为实现这一计划而奋斗。
