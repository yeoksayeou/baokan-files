Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. According to TASS reports: The UN General Assembly on the 3rd unanimously approved the resolution proposed by the Political Committee condemning propaganda for a new war. The activities of the American ruling clique and the American delegation to oppose the passage of this resolution have completely failed. The head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, issued a statement saying: "Although the resolution proposed by the Political Committee does not point out the countries where the peddling of war is particularly widespread, which is insincere and inappropriate; the Soviet delegation still voted in favor because condemning any form of war propaganda is the guiding ideology of the Soviet Union. The resolution unanimously approved by the Political Committee and just approved by the General Assembly clearly condemns any form of war propaganda, and this idea and demand for condemning war propaganda suits the interests of all peace-loving nations and all progressive people. The Soviet delegation has always believed that condemning the new war propaganda is its fundamental, most important, and most urgent mission."

    苏联和平政策继续赢得胜利
    谴责战争宣传的决议
    联大全体会一致批准
    【新华社陕北六日电】据塔斯社报导：联大全体会议三日一致批准了政委会所提出的谴责新战争宣传的决议。美国统治集团和美国代表团反对通过这个决议的种种活动，至此彻底失败。苏代表团团长维辛斯基发表声明称：“虽然政委会提出的决议没有指出贩卖战争特别广泛的国家，是不诚意和不适当的；但苏联代表团仍投了赞成票，因为谴责任何形式的战争宣传，就是苏联的主导思想。政委会所一致批准而刚才又为大会批准了的决议，明确地谴责任何形式的战争宣传，这种谴责战争宣传的思想与要求，适合一切爱好和平民族、一切进步人们利益的。苏联代表团曾相信谴责新战争宣传是其基本的最重大的最迫切的使命”。
