According to an Associated Press report on the 19th, the Philippine People's Guerrilla's recent battles with Roxas' reinforcement troops resulted in over 40 casualties among the suppression army. Seven People's Guerrilla detachments are persisting in guerrilla warfare against the enemy in the Nueva Ecija and Isabela province regions of Central Luzon. According to Philippine Constabulary Headquarters, since the "General Election," three major battles have occurred in the region, with 700 to 1,000 guerrillas currently assisting and protecting farmers during the autumn harvest.
