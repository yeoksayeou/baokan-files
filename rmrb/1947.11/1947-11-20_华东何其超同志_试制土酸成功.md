　　Xinhua News Agency, East China, 16th: Comrade He Qichao, director of the Chemical Factory of the East China Military Region, has successfully used local halite to trial-produce local acid (local aqua fortis), solving a major difficulty in the iron industry. The cost is only 600 Northern currency units (equivalent to 20 times the Chiang currency) per pound, with the same effect as imported products but at a tenth of the price. Preparations are now underway for mass production to facilitate its application.
