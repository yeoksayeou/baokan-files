    The First Batch of Militiamen Return
    Carrying Back American Guns
    [This newspaper's Taiyue, 6th dispatch] The first batch of militiamen and laborers from the Taiyue Second Military Subdistrict who went south have returned victoriously. This time, the militiamen and laborers from various counties actively cooperated with the southward expeditionary army in combat, and many model deeds emerged. Comrade Guo Junli from the Fifth District of Quwo led a team of laborers. During the Battle of Lingbao, they saw scattered Chiang bandit soldiers with the army's medical team in Xishang Village. Militiamen Zhou Jincheng, Yang Guangyu, and others said, "This is a chance to gain glory and exchange for some American-made guns to carry." So, Zhou Jincheng took the lead, carrying a gun and shouting, "Don't move, surrender your weapons!" At this time, they were only forty meters away. Then, four more people followed. Seeing that Zhou Jincheng had few men, the scattered bandits attempted to resist. Cui Tianke, in a moment of inspiration, shouted, "First row, advance to the left flank to block the enemy! Second row, machine guns, prepare to fire!" The fifteen scattered bandits panicked and quickly surrendered their American machine guns and became prisoners. According to incomplete statistics from the five counties of Fushan, Qinshui, Quwo, Yicheng, and Jiangxian, they captured two small cannons, three machine guns, two hundred and fifty rifles, five pistols, more than four thousand rounds of ammunition, two horses, and many other military supplies.

    首批民兵归来
    扛回美国枪炮
    【本报太岳六日电】太岳二分区首批南征民兵民工已胜利归来。此次各县民兵民工积极的配合南征大军作战，出现不少模范事迹。曲沃五区郭军礼同志带领的一队民工，在灵宝战役中，随大军卫生队在西上村见了蒋匪散兵，民兵周金成、杨广玉等六人说：“这可要光荣光荣，换几枝美国造的枪扛扛”，于是周金成头一个提着枪迎上去，叫道“不要动缴枪”，此时仅距离四十多公尺，随后又有四人跟上去，散匪看周金成人少企图还击，在后面的崔天可急中生智，叫喊道：“第一排向左翼前进阻击敌人，第二排机枪准备射击”。十五个散匪慌的赶忙缴了美国机枪，当了俘虏。据浮山、沁水、曲沃、翼城、绛县五县不完全统计，就缴获小炮二门，机枪三挺、步枪二百五十枝，手枪五枝，弹药四千余发，马两匹，及其他军用物资甚多。
