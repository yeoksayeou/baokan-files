　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: According to a Canadian United Press report from the 8th, the Canadian people, in order to oppose the Canadian reactionary government's aid to Chiang Kai-shek's civil war with military supplies, held a mass rally in Montreal (the location of the shipment of military supplies to aid Chiang). The Canadian Seamen's Union, the Young Workers' Union, the McGill Student Labor Group, and others who attended the meeting unanimously opposed the Canadian government's crimes of aiding Chiang Kai-shek's civil war. Dr. Endicott (i.e., Wen Youzhang), who recently returned to Canada from China, gave a two-hour speech at the meeting, denouncing the Canadian government's recent aid of 2,500 tons of military weapons to Chiang Kai-shek's civil war. Endicott called on the masses present to sign a petition opposing this behavior by the Canadian government. Endicott revealed that the batch of military supplies to aid Chiang Kai-shek included ammunition, machine guns, aircraft parts, tires, rails, and parts of Canadian military factories dismantled and prepared to be reassembled in China. The batch of supplies was loaded on the Atlantic Shipping Company's 10,000-ton cargo ship Cliffside, scheduled to leave the Port of Montreal on the morning of the 9th. Endicott pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek's Gestapo government should be responsible for the Chinese civil war, pointing out that the Chinese civil war is similar to the American "War of Liberation," and the Chinese Communist Party is similar to George Washington, whose goal is to establish a truly democratic country. Endicott denounced the bourgeois "newspapers for touting aid to Chiang Kai-shek in an attempt to deceive the people of Western countries, and criticized the distorted reports on the Chinese situation by the two reactionary magazines American "Life" and "Time" (referring to the reports on Bullitt's visit to China in the two magazines).
　　
    Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 9th: In the Qingfengdian annihilation battle on the 22nd of last month, the People's Liberation Army seized 22 new-style light machine guns provided by Canada to aid Chiang Kai-shek. The machine guns are simple in mechanism, with flower-shaped marks painted in yellow on the gun body and the word "CANADA". The Canadian government's aiding of Chiang Kai-shek's civil war and massacre of the Chinese people has gained another ironclad proof.

    【新华社陕北九日电】据合众社加拿大八日消息，加拿大人民为反对加拿大反动政府以军火援蒋内战，在蒙特利尔（即装运援蒋军火地点）举行群众大会，与会之加拿大海员工人联合会，青年工人联合会，米吉尔学生劳工团体等，皆一致反对加政府援蒋内战罪行。不久前由华返加之恩特科（即文幼章）博士在会上发表长达两小时之演说，痛斥加政府最近以二千五百吨军火武器援蒋内战，恩氏号召到会群众签署一申请书，反对加政府此种行为。恩氏揭露，该批援蒋军事物资中包括军火，机枪，飞机要件、轮胎、铁轨，以及拆卸下来准备在中国重新装配的加军事工厂零件。该批物资载于大西洋航运公司一万吨的货船克利夫塞德号上，定于九日晨驶离蒙特利尔海港。恩氏指出蒋介石的盖斯塔波政府应对中国内战负责，指出中国内战类似美国“解放战争”，中共类似乔治·华盛顿，其目的是建立一个真正民主的国家。恩氏指斥资产阶级“报纸吹嘘援助蒋介石，以图蒙蔽西方国家人民，并抨击美“生活”及“时代”两反动杂志关于中国情势的歪曲报导（按指该两杂志所载布立特访华报告）。
    【新华社晋察冀九日电】上月二十二日清风店歼灭战中，解放军曾缴获加拿大援蒋之新式轻机枪二十二挺，该种机枪机件简单，枪身有黄色漆饰之花朵形标记，并有ＣＡＮＡＤＡ字样，加政府援蒋内战屠杀中国人民又获一铁证。
