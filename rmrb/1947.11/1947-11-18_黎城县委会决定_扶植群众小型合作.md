　　【News from this paper, Licheng】 Based on the county committee's understanding of the widespread drought and poor harvests (generally 70% yield) and the foundation of mass mutual aid and cooperation movements in the Great Production Campaign over the past four years, a detailed study of winter production work was conducted. Everyone unanimously agreed that: Cooperative societies should be at the core, and mass-based mutual aid and cooperation movements should be universally launched to implement the increased production and disaster relief campaign. This policy was specifically arranged at the joint meeting of branch secretaries. The main points are: First, county, district, and village cooperative societies, in order to effectively support the widespread development of small-scale mass cooperation movements, must resolutely hand over their directly operated factories and workshops to the masses themselves. This has been a heavy burden for cooperative societies at all levels in Licheng for several years. If this burden is released, a large number of cadres will be freed up to focus on organizing the masses to directly produce, and a large amount of capital will be released to support mass production through credit unions to absorb more idle funds. In short, the basic task of large cooperative societies in the future is to support the development of small-scale mass cooperation movements. Large cooperative societies will not handle any business that the masses can directly operate. Second, in order to develop production and sales channels, and expand production profits, the blindness in production must be overcome. To this end, base-point central cooperative societies can be established. Through the central cooperative societies (each village can select people to participate in leadership), accurate calculations should be made to strengthen the organization and planning of winter production work. For example, Dong Village can open a dye shop, and Xi Village can open a pharmacy, and a small market can be directly organized to exchange goods and organize small-scale exports. Third, from the county-wide perspective, transportation and textile industries should be given equal importance this winter, with transportation and textile industries at the center, combined with the production of mountain goods and other products. In order to expand profits and facilitate sales, costs must be reduced and quality improved. Fourth, through cooperative societies, small-scale exports should be organized at any time to exchange for necessary supplies, and transportation should be organized at the same time, so that transportation and trade are combined. In order to ensure smooth sales, boycott enemy goods must be resisted. Cooperative public stores are not allowed to sell enemy goods. In the future, in order to unify the guidance of handicraft and sideline production and further develop economic work, a "Cooperation Committee" should be established at the county level, composed of the county government, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, the bank, the county federation of cooperative societies, the county committee, and the Public Security Bureau. This organization is the highest organizational form of economic work. It is not only a research institution, but also a powerful authority to guide the county's economic work.

　　黎城县委会决定
    扶植群众小型合作
    【本报黎城讯】县委会根据全县旱灾歉收情况（普遍七成年景），与四年来大生产运动中群众互助合作运动的基础，详细研究了今冬生产工作，大家一致认为：应以合作社为核心，普遍开展群众性的互助合作运动，贯澈增产渡荒运动，并将这个方针在分书联席会上具体作了布置，其要点为：一、县区村合作社，为了有力扶植群众普遍发展小型合作运动，必须下决心将自己直接经营的各个工厂与作坊交给群众自己办，这是黎城各级合作社几年来背着的一的老包袱，如果将这个包袱放下，将会抽出大量干部，专心专意的去组织群众自己直接生产，也会抽出大部资金，通过信用部吸收更多游资，去扶植群众生产。总之，大合作社今后基本任务在于扶植群众小型合作运动的发展，凡是群众能直接经营的事业，大合作社一概不办。二、为了发展生产销路，扩大生产利润，必须克服生产中的盲目性，为此可成立基点中心合作社，通过中心合作社（各村可选人参加领导），精确计算，加强冬季生产工作的组织与计划性。比如东村开个染坊，西村可开个药铺，并可直接组织个小集市，互通有无，组织点滴输出。三、从全县范围看，今冬运输与纺织应该并重，以运输纺织为中心，结合山货等生产。为扩大利润，便于出售，必须减低成本，提高质量。四、通过合作社，随时组织点滴出口，换回必须用品，同时结合着将运输组织起来，使运输与贸易结合起来。为了畅销，必须抵制仇货，合作社公营商店一律不准贩卖仇货。今后为了统一对手工业副业生产的指导，更得发展经济工作，县级成立“合作委员会”，由县府、工商局、银行、县联社、县委会、公安局参加组成，这个组织是经济工作的最高组织形式，它不仅是个研究机关，而是一个指导全县经济工作的权力机关。
