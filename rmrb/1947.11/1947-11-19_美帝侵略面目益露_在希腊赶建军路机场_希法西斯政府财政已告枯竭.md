Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: Reports from various sources: The powerful offensive of the Greek Democratic Army has caused extreme panic among US imperialists, who are hastily repairing bases and intensifying their control over the Greek government army. After the Greek reactionary authorities held a military conference in Volos on October 14th, they reorganized the General Staff, appointing the pro-American General Vis as Chief of Staff, and replacing several senior officials with Americans. Currently, even down to the company level in the fascist army, American officers are directing combat operations. On the other hand, the United States is actively building military bunkers and roads at strategic locations on the islands of Syros, Corfu, Crete, and in the Peloponnese. American soldiers are personally building military roads and airports in important locations in Greece to guard against the powerful offensive of the Democratic Army.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: Athens News: The Greek fascist government's finances are now exhausted due to the enormous military expenditures incurred by launching the civil war. According to the "Eleftheria" newspaper, the Greek government needs 220 million US dollars annually just to maintain the army, and 150 million US dollars for military supplies. These two expenses exceed the total amount of US "aid" to Greece by 70 million US dollars (according to the US aid to Greece and Turkey Act, the total US aid to Greece is 300 million US dollars). Coupled with other urgent economic needs, Greece's budget deficit for this year is as high as 400 million US dollars. Now, in order to make up for the deficit, the Greek government, under the instructions of the American delegation, is preparing to intensify the exploitation of the people by increasing taxes and import/export duties. According to the head of the American delegation, Griswold, at a press conference: the new taxes will be levied from November 1st. The announcement of these domestic measures by foreigners has not only surprised public opinion, but also caused turmoil in the Greek market, with prices rising sharply and food scarce.

　　美帝侵略面目益露
  　在希腊赶建军路机场
    希法西斯政府财政已告枯竭
    【新华社陕北十三日电】各方讯：希民主军的强大攻势，使美帝国主义惊惶莫名，正急忙抢修基地及加紧其对希腊政府军的控制。希腊反动当局于十月十四日在倭罗召开军事会议后，即实行改组统帅部，以亲美的维斯将军出任参谋总长，并更换若干高级官员而代以美人，目前甚至法西斯军各单位直至营一级，均有美国军官指挥作战。另一方面美国正在塞索斯岛、科孚岛、克里特岛及摩里亚半岛上的战略据点，积极修筑军事碉堡与道路。美国兵并亲自在希腊各重要地点建筑军路及机场，以防范民主军的强大攻势。
    【新华社陕北十三日电】雅典讯：希腊法西斯政府因发动内战耗费庞大军费，现财政已告枯竭。据此间“爱里弗特纳”报称：希政府仅维持陆军费用每年便需二亿二千万美元，军火需一亿五千万美元，这两项费用已超出美国“援”希总数达七千万美元（按美国根据援助希土法案，援希总数为三亿美元）再加上经济方面其他急需，使希腊今年预算亏空达四亿美元之多。现希腊政府为弥补亏空起见，在美国代表团的指使下，准备加紧压榨人民，增加租税与进出口税。据美国代表团团长格利斯伍德在记者招待会上宣称：新税自十一月一日开征。此项内政措施由外国人宣布之后，不仅引起舆论的惊异，且使希腊市面为之动荡，物价急剧高涨，粮食有行无市。
