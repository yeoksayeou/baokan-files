Deep Ploughing, Early Planting, Sufficient Manure, Careful Weeding
　　Yielding an Extra One Stone and Four Dou Per Mu
　　Poor Peasant Li Jinfu Cultivates One, Surplus One
[This newspaper, Lingchuan News] Li Jinfu, the political director of Nan Jie in Pingcheng Township, is fifty years old and comes from a poor peasant background. He joined the work as soon as the Eighth Route Army arrived. He has consistently been active in his work, taking the lead in production with achievements. Last year, he was selected as a labor hero of the entire district. This year, under the government's call for a large-scale production campaign, he became even more active, hoeing more and applying more fertilizer, participating in mutual aid. His six mu and seven fen of land yielded eighteen stone and four dou of grain, one stone of beans, and five dou of sesame seeds, totaling nineteen stone and nine dou. The average actual grain yield per mu was two stone and nine dou and seven, while the general grain yield per mu was only one stone and five dou. His yield exceeded one stone, four dou, and seven sheng. On the evening of October 15th, at the autumn harvest and wheat planting conference attended by over seven hundred people in the village, Comrade Li Jinfu reported on his harvest. The masses all said, "How could he harvest so much?" The district public security officers, comrades Wang Guobao and Qin Dongwang, went to his home to measure the grain, and it was accurate to the dou. Only then did the masses believe it and unanimously said, "Jinfu is truly capable! The government asked us to achieve 'cultivating three, surplus one,' but we still feel it's impossible. Jinfu has achieved 'cultivating one, surplus one.' We should strive to catch up with all our strength!" The masses unanimously asked him to talk about his experience in increasing grain production. He said it was very simple: (1) Plough deeper in the autumn, so it will be easier to cultivate seedlings in the spring; (2) Plant early and plant deep, so the crops can withstand drought and mature early, and not be killed by frost; (3) Apply more fertilizer, and also apply topdressing fertilizer, averaging fifty dan per mu; (4) Hoe more, at least hoe, till, pull, and rake each once, for a total of four times, and the seedlings will thrive. The masses listened and unanimously supported him, saying, "Next year, we will all do it according to your method!" The masses decided to present him with a large red banner. Since then, Comrade Li Jinfu has been even more energetic. Recently, he has been leading the masses in autumn plowing and land reclamation. Due to the shortage of livestock, he led over one hundred and fifty people to hoe the land, and they hoed fifteen mu of land in one morning.

　　深垡早种粪饱细锄
    每亩多打一石四斗
  　贫农李金富耕一余一
    【本报陵川讯】平城镇南街政治主任李金富，已五十岁，贫农出身，八路军一到他就参加了工作，在工作中一贯积极，带头生产有成绩，去年即被选为全区劳动英雄。今年政府号召大生产运动下，他更加积极，多锄又多上肥，参加互助，六亩七分地就打下十八石四斗谷、豆一石、麻子五斗，共计十九石九斗，每亩平均实产粮二石九斗七，一般每亩产粮才一石五斗，他的产量超过一石四斗七升。十月十五日晚，全村七百余人总结秋收种麦大会上，李金富同志报告了他的收成，群众都说：“怎能打这么多，当即由区公安干事王国保与秦东旺二同志亲到他家现过了斗，一斗也不差，群众才相信了，一致说：‘人家金富真能行，政府叫咱们作到耕三余一，咱还感觉办不到，人家金富作到耕一余一，咱们应该全力赶上！’群众一致让他谈多打粮食的经验，他说很简单：（一）秋天耕时要犁的深些，春天就能好捉苗；（二）种的早，种的深，能吃旱，能早黄，霜不死；（三）上粪要多，又可上追粪，每亩平均上五十担才行；（四）要多锄，至少挽、锄、拉、搂各一遍，共四遍，苗就发了。群众听了，一致拥护，都说：“明年都照你这法干！”群众决定送他大红旗一面。李金富同志自此后更有劲了，最近领着群众秋耕与开荒，由于牲口少，他领着一百五十余人来刨地，一上午就刨十五亩地。
