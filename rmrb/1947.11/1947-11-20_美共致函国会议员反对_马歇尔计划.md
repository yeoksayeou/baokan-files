　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. Agence France-Presse, New York dispatch: Just as the U.S. special Congress is about to convene, Foster, Chairman of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, and Dennis, General Secretary, issued here on the 10th an open letter to all Congressmen, condemning the Marshall Plan as a reactionary imperialist policy of the great American capitalists, aimed at turning western Germany and European countries into economic appendages of the United States. The letter calls on Congressmen to oppose the forced implementation of the Marshall Plan. Regarding how to oppose the severe domestic inflation problem, the letter advocates: (1) Restore price controls and food rationing; (2) Restore the current high prices to the level before the price controls were lifted last June; (3) Exempt low-income groups from taxes; (4) Restore the excess profits tax.
