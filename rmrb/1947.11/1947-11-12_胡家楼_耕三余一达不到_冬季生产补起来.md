    "Cultivate Three, Surplus One" Unachieved
    Winter Production Makes Up the Difference
    [Reported from Xingtai by this newspaper] Under the leadership of Village Head Fan Shoushan and Cooperative Manager Fan Shoudian in Hujialou Village, District Nine, the masses had a high level of enthusiasm for production this year. However, due to the lack of rain this summer, when the accounts were recently settled, the goal of "Cultivate Three, Surplus One" was not achieved. The cadres immediately sought solutions and called on everyone to engage in winter production to make up the difference. The entire village consists of 153 households with 572 people, and the total grain shortfall is 99 shi, 2 dou, 2 sheng, and 5 ge. After calculating the accounts, the cadres were shocked and immediately convened all the village cadres to find ways to make up for the shortfall. It was decided to immediately organize the masses for transportation. The village has a total of 40 donkeys and 4 mules, with 44 people participating in transportation. They set a plan to guarantee earning 2 million yuan in foreign currency by the end of this year. Simultaneously, spinning and weaving will be expanded, capable of earning 1.5 million yuan in foreign currency; the cooperative can earn 1 million yuan, and handicrafts can earn 100,000 yuan. Every 4,000 yuan is equivalent to 1 dou of grain, so the above can earn money to buy 90 shi of grain. After calculation, there is still a shortage of 9 shi of grain, so it was decided to supplement it by gathering wild vegetables and practicing frugality. Once the plan was set, they immediately took action. The surplus labor force is transforming the land foundation, preparing to build three mu of irrigated land this winter and next spring.
