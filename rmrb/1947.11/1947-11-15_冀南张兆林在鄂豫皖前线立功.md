Xinhua News Agency, Hubei-Henan-Anhui Front, 12th: Zhang Zhaolin, the second hero of a certain regiment of the Wujiang Detachment of the People's Liberation Army, made a significant contribution in the Xiaogangling battle during the Jieling-Gaoshanpu campaign and was promoted to deputy platoon leader. The regiment's leaders called for a Zhang Zhaolin campaign to be launched throughout the regiment. Xiaogangling was the command post of the enemy's 40th Division in Qingshuihe. The small hill, only a hundred meters or so, was surrounded by enemies, with only one gap. On the morning of October 27th, Battalion Commander Zheng received the task of attacking the enemy in Qingshuihe and ordered a platoon to penetrate this gap with a "tiger digs the heart" tactic to capture Xiaogangling. When the enemy realized what was happening, they struggled desperately, using intense artillery fire to cover counterattacks from all directions. Xiaogangling was filled with smoke, and bullets and bombs landed all around the brave soldiers. At this moment, Battalion Commander Zheng ordered Platoon Leader Qi Wenfato to reinforce the position, repel the enemy, and hold the hilltop. After repelling two enemy charges, the enemy launched a third attack with even more intense artillery fire and more troops surging up the hill. Platoon Leader Qi was seriously wounded, and the position was in imminent danger. Squad Leader Zhang Zhaolin stood up, holding his bayonet, and shouted loudly: "Comrades, we cannot retreat! We must hold the position, repel the enemy's counterattack, and avenge Platoon Leader Qi!" He bravely charged towards the enemy. His call and actions immediately inspired all the soldiers. Machine gunner Li Guixiang quickly picked up his machine gun and fired furiously at the enemy. Liang Laixin of the mortar squad picked up the gun of a wounded soldier and fired at the enemy. Zhang Zhaolin stabbed one enemy to death with his bayonet, and the remaining enemies were mostly killed or wounded by the firepower and rolled down the hill. Soon after, they cooperated with friendly units and eliminated the enemy's command post. Zhang Zhaolin is from Guangping, Southern Hebei, and a member of the Communist Party. He joined the People's Liberation Army this September and has been a model in training, marching, and combat. He won a special merit award from the 3rd Company of the regiment and was recognized as the second hero of the entire regiment.

　　冀南张兆林在鄂豫皖前线立功
    【新华社鄂豫皖前线十二日电】解放军乌江部某团第二名英雄张兆林，在界岭高山铺战役的小岗岭战斗中立了头功，被提升为副排长，该团首长并号召全团展开张兆林运动。小岗岭是清水河敌四十师的指挥所，百十公尺的小山头，周围都是敌人，只有一处有空隙，郑营长于十月二十七日晨受领了攻击清水河敌人的任务，便以猛虎掏心的战法，命令一个排从这个空隙杀进去，攻占了小岗岭。敌人一发觉，便死命挣扎，以猛烈的炮火从四面掩护反扑，小岗岭一片烟雾，勇士们身旁落遍了子弹和炸弹。这时郑营长便命令齐文法排增援上去，打退敌人，固守山头阵地。一连打退了敌人两次冲锋，第三次敌人以更猛烈的炮火掩护更多的敌人冲上山头，齐排长身负重伤，阵地岌岌可危，七班长张兆林站起来，端着刺刀，高声呐喊：“同志们，我们不能退下去，一定要坚守阵地，打退敌人反扑，为齐排长复仇！”于是他勇敢的向敌人扑去。他的呼声和行动，立即鼓舞了全体战士，机枪手李桂香，迅速拿起机枪向敌人猛烈射击，小炮班的梁徕信，拿起负伤者的枪，对准敌人射击。张兆林一刺刀刺死一个敌人，其余敌人在火力下死伤大半，纷纷滚下山去了，不久便和友邻部队配合，解决了敌人的指挥部。张兆林冀南广平人，共产党员，今年九月参加解放军，在练兵行军及战斗中，都是模范，荣获该团三连特等功，为全团第二名英雄。
