Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 8th: Late news: The People's Liberation Army recovered Xiangning County in southwestern Shanxi on October 29th. From this point westward from the Tongpu Railway to the bank of the Yellow River, the entire southwestern Shanxi region has been liberated. When our army attacked Jixian, over a thousand miscellaneous Hu-Yan bandit troops from Xiangning and other places converged and fled east towards Linfen. The PLA pursued them day and night, giving the bandit troops no chance to catch their breath. In the end, less than four hundred men fled to Linfen. In addition to those killed or wounded along the way, over five hundred were captured by the PLA. Linfen is now isolated within the PLA's encirclement.

Xinhua News Agency, Henan-Shaanxi Frontline, 8th: The majority of bandits in the western Henan liberated area have been eliminated. This area has always been a place where bandits roamed, and most of the bandits were controlled by landlords. They built fortified villages and dominated the area. After our army entered western Henan, most of the bandits became scattered bandits, and under the instigation and support of the Chiang bandits, they continued to harm the local people. After our liberation of the vast area, we immediately dispatched small units and local mass self-defense armed forces to clear and suppress the area by district. At the end of August, our army captured Yangpo village in Luoning, where more than 700 bandits were entrenched, and wiped out all the bandits, including the bandit leaders Wang Jiesan, Li Yuncai, and Yang Tengjiao. In early September, our army jointly suppressed the bandits in the area bordering Xin'an and Mianchi north of the Longhai Railway, capturing some and dispersing the rest. From October 2nd, our army in Lushi suppressed the remaining bandits in the Wulichuan, Zhuyangguan, and Houhuaishu areas south of the city, eliminating a stubborn bandit company. In mid-October, our army in Yiyang surrounded and suppressed the bandits of Qiao Zirong (former Chiang bandit brigade commander) several times. The bandits were severely damaged and collapsed. On October 26th, our army raided Qiao bandit's lair, Wencun (northwest of Yiyang), capturing Qiao Jinfa, one of the bandit leaders, and dozens of others, and liberating many women kidnapped by the Qiao bandits. Qiao bandits were publicly tried and executed on the 28th. During the suppression of bandits, the peasants who were being emancipated in various places actively searched for scattered bandits and seized weapons from reactionary landlords to arm themselves. According to incomplete statistics, in the first half of October, the masses in four counties of a certain sub-district seized 927 rifles from bandits and landlords.
