    Mutual Aid and Diligence Transform the Barren Sandy Land
    Yangzhuang Achieves "Cultivate Three, Surplus One"
    [Our newspaper's Jinnan dispatch on the 2nd] Yangzhuang village, Yuan Dynasty, through mutual aid and increased production, has promoted the spirit of "relying on the mountain to eat from the mountain, relying on the water to eat from the water," transforming a barren sandy area into a "silver sandy area," achieving "cultivate three, surplus one." Out of the village's 5,638.5 mu of land, more than 2,500 mu are sandy lands unsuitable for planting seedlings. Because of the launch of the land reclamation and planting campaign this year, all 168 households in the village participated in mutual aid, so not a single mu of sandy land was left uncultivated. A total of 262 mu of wasteland were opened up in spring and autumn, 284 mu of saplings were planted, and 140+ mu of hemp seedling (some uncultivated planted saplings) were planted. The sandy land is now forested with lush trees, making a spectacular sight. Because the soil in the village is suitable for harvesting peanuts, mutual aid was organized to carry water for planting, resulting in the planting of 769 mu, accounting for 25% of the cultivated land. Other income from the sandy area: 7,156 apricot, pear, and date trees, selling fruits earned 10,439,000 yuan; 308 mu of hemp seedling earned 4,464,000 yuan; 209 mu of wild plum saplings earned 418,000 yuan; 590 mu of tree rows earned 2,137,200 yuan; 769 mu of peanuts could yield 161,605 jin of peanuts, which could be processed into oil and sold for 18,187,300 yuan, the peanut cakes produced could be sold for 5,439,600 yuan; seven sows earned 550,000 yuan; sixteen textile groups earned 653,700 yuan this year, totaling 40,038,800 yuan, equivalent to 60 yuan per jin of coarse grains, for a total of 73,146 jin. This year, 2,322 mu of autumn land yielded 373,767 jin of grain, bringing the total annual grain yield to 1,046,913 jin of coarse grain. The annual miscellaneous expenses such as salt and vegetables for each person require 14,407 yuan (this is the average number surveyed by the Huo Wentang mutual aid group), and the entire village of 886 people requires 12,766,402 yuan. The village has a total of 5,411 mu of land subject to levies, requiring 54,110 jin of public firewood, totaling 1,082,200 yuan. Livestock feed costs 1,298,700 yuan. The above total 15,195,320 yuan, equivalent to 253,189 jin of coarse grains. The annual public grain quota requires 45,001 jin of coarse grains. The annual grain consumption per person is calculated at 456 jin (based on the average grain consumption of the old and young surveyed by the Huo Wentang mutual aid group), requiring a total of 404,016 jin of coarse grains for the entire village. The total annual grain consumption is 700,2206 jin. Thus, the entire village has a surplus of 344,707 jin of grain after deducting consumption, achieving "cultivate three, surplus one."

    互助勤劳改变了荒沙窝
    杨庄耕三余一
    【本报冀南二日电】元朝杨庄互助增产，发扬“靠山吃山靠水吃水”精神，变荒沙窝成银沙窝，达到耕三余一。全村五千六百三十八亩五分地中，不能耩苗的沙地就有二千五百余亩。因在今年开展了开荒种植运动，全村共一百六十八户都参加了互助，所以一亩沙地也没有荒了。总计春秋共开了二百六十二亩荒，插了二百八十四亩条子，种了一百四十余亩麻豆秧（有的没开的插了条子），沙地现已树木成林，苍翠可观。该村因土壤易收花生，互助担水、拉水下种，共种了七百六十九亩，作耕地的百分之二十五。沙窝的其他收成：杏、梨、枣树共七千一百五十六棵，卖果子能赚一千零四十三万九千元；麻豆秧三百零八亩，收四百四十六万四千元；杜李条子二百零九亩，收四十一万八千元；树行五百九十亩，收二百一十三万七千二百元；花生七百六十九亩，能收花生十六万一千六百零五斤，打成油能卖洋一千八百十八万七千三百元，所出花生饼能卖洋五百四十三万九千六百元；七只老母猪赚洋五十五万元；十六个纺织组，今年赚洋六十五万三千七百元，以上共合洋四千零三十八万八千八百元，每斤粗粮合六十元，共合七万三千一百四十六斤。今年二千三百二十二亩秋地，收粮三十七万三千七百六十七斤，全年总计合一百零四万六千九百一十三斤粗粮。每人全年用盐、菜等杂用需洋一万四千四百零七元（这是霍文堂互助组调查平均出来的数目），全村八百八十六人，得用洋一千二百六十六万四千六百零二元。全村共五千四百一十一亩负担地，出公柴五万四千一百一十斤，共合洋一百零八万二千二百元。牲口用草料合洋一百二十九万八千七百元。以上共合洋一千五百一十九万五千三百二十元，共合粗粮二十五万三千一百八十九斤。公粮全年须粗粮四万五千零一斤，人吃每人每年按四百五十六斤（根据霍文堂互助组调查的老小用粮平均数），全村须粗粮四十万四千零一十六斤。全年用粮总数七十万零二千二百零六斤。这样全村除了吃用外，尚能余粮三十四万四千七百零七斤，做到了耕三余一。
