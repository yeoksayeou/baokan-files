After this major propaganda effort, the masses shifted from ideological confusion to understanding the great counter-offensive, and the work enthusiasm of the cadres was greatly enhanced. Gengsheng District and Liming District penetrated into the vicinity of various strongholds along the Heze-Kao Highway, posting slogans and distributing leaflets, and successfully completed the autumn tax collection. After Yanhuang District conducted propaganda near Heze City, they also cut four li of electric wires.
