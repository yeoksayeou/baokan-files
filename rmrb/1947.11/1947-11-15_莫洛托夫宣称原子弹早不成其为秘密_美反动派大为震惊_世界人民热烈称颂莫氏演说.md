Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 11th: A comprehensive report: Molotov's statement in his November 6th speech that "the secret of the atomic bomb is no longer a secret" has caused shock among reactionaries of all countries, led by the United States, fully demonstrating their confusion and unease after losing their last weapon of intimidation. The Associated Press reported on November 6th, exclaiming: Molotov's "words are tantamount to implying that the Soviet Union has learned this secret." However, its November 7th dispatch attempted to dilute this impression, falsely claiming that "the Soviet Union does not yet have the atomic bomb, but it is speculated that it is confident about the time it will take to produce the atomic bomb." A special dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 6th comforted Chiang Kai-shek's small court, saying that its American daddy "authorities generally do not believe that the Soviet Union has the atomic bomb." The US State Department's broadcast, the day after Molotov's speech, used all its time and 34 languages to broadcast speeches by so-called "first-class" figures, "to make the audience ignore Molotov's atomic bomb statement" (Associated Press). At the same time, according to a dispatch from the Associated Press on the 7th, the US "government senior officials, stimulated by the vivid and powerful Soviet propaganda offensive, will consider strengthening the American propaganda movement. High-ranking US officials said: American news agencies must adopt a more aggressive approach, and propaganda should be flexible, effective, and decisive." Agence France-Presse reported on the 6th that "the US State Department will soon request Congress to allocate $2 million to strengthen shortwave broadcasts to Europe." The reactionary Vatican, which originally wanted to use the atomic bomb to deal with the Soviet Union and the world democratic movement, for the first time "hoped" to ban atomic weapons in its official newspaper. The newspaper stated: "Since the secret of the atomic bomb is no longer a secret and exclusive, its effectiveness has been greatly reduced even if it is not eliminated, and there is no longer any reservation to oppose the decision to ban the use of atomic bombs in war." As for the official Nanjing bandit party, according to Reuters on the 7th, it dared not make any "comments" on Molotov's statement about the atomic bomb.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 11th: Reports from various sources: Molotov's speech on the anniversary of the October Revolution has aroused warm praise from the people of the world. The Bulgarian newspaper "Otechestven Front" said: "Molotov has produced a detailed balance sheet of contemporary history. This table shows the irreparable losses of the imperialist forces and the surprisingly large assets of the democratic camp. Millions of people with peace aspirations undoubtedly welcomed Molotov's speech with enthusiasm and hope. Because for them, this is a call to form a strong and invincible camp." The Czechoslovakian newspaper "Prace" said: "Molotov's speech is a major blow to Western imperialism, which until now has regarded the atomic bomb as its last trump card. It is not surprising that international reactionaries are trying to downplay the impression created by Molotov's statement on the atomic bomb." The Finnish newspaper "Suomen Sosialidemokraatti" said: "The Soviet Union liberated the people of many countries from fascist slavery in the last war, and now the Soviet Union is carrying out an invincible struggle against imperialist aggression and defending peace and national independence in the post-war period. This is why it has many friends in all countries, especially among the broad working class and peasantry. People all over the world are very satisfied to learn about Molotov's statement on the atomic bomb." The New York "PM" newspaper welcomed Molotov's re-emphasis on Stalin's statement to Stassen that "countries with different economic systems can cooperate with each other." The newspaper stated: "Molotov's speech not only demonstrated confidence in the Soviet system, but also demonstrated a desire for peaceful coexistence with the United States." The newspaper called on the United States to implement a peaceful policy. It also stated: "The United States has done too much in 'diligently manufacturing new weapons of war. If there were more confidence in the capitalist system, the United States might not be so obsessed with destructive means.'" The newspaper also criticized Dewey's speech on the 5th, saying: "Dewey suggested that to stabilize China, it is only necessary to help the corrupt, incompetent, and traitorous Kuomintang government wage an anti-communist war. This is a most dangerous deception." The New York Post and the Toronto Star in Canada also emphasized Molotov's point that the United States and the Soviet Union can cooperate. The latter expressed admiration for the Soviet Union's achievements in construction and post-war recovery, and concluded by saying: Millions of people sincerely desire Soviet-American cooperation.

　　莫洛托夫宣称原子弹早不成其为秘密
  　美反动派大为震惊
    世界人民热烈称颂莫氏演说
    【新华社陕北十一日电】综合报导：莫洛托夫六日演说中关于“原子弹秘密早已不成其为秘密”一语，引起了以美国为首的各国反动派的震惊，充分显示它们在失去其最后一个吓诈武器之后已如何混乱不安。合众社六日电惊呼：莫氏“此语不啻暗示苏联已获知此项秘密。”而其七日电则又力图冲淡这一印象，诡称“苏尚无原子弹，唯推测其对制成原子弹之时间已有把握。”六日的中央社专电则安慰蒋家小朝廷称：其美国爸爸“当局咸不信苏联已有原子弹。”美国务院之广播，在莫洛托夫演说之次日，即以全部时间及三十四种语言广播所谓“第一流”人物的演说，“使听众忽视莫洛托夫之原子弹声明”（合众社）。同时，据美联社七日电供称：美“政府高级官员，因受生动有力之苏联宣传攻势所刺激，将考虑加强美国的宣传运动。身居高位之美官员称：美国新闻通讯社必须采取更富于攻势性的工作，应有机动特效断然的宣传”。法新社六日电透露：“美国务院不久即将要求国会拨出二百万元，加强对欧陆的短波广播”。原来要求以原子弹对付苏联及世界民主运动的反动梵蒂冈，则在其机关报上初次“希望”禁用原子武器了。该报称：“由于原子弹秘密已不再是秘密与独占的东西，其效用即使不消除也已大减，再没有任何保留以反对决定禁用原子弹于战争了”。至南京匪党官方，据路透社七日称，则对莫洛托夫关于原子弹声明不敢加以“评论”。
    【新华社陕北十一日电】各方讯：莫洛托夫在十月革命节的演说，已引起世界人民的热烈称颂。保加利亚“欧茨、契斯特维”报说：“莫洛托夫为当代历史开出了一张精细的资产负债表，这张表表明了帝国主义势力无可补偿的亏蚀，与民主阵营惊人庞大的资产。千百万怀抱和平愿望的人民，无疑都以热情与希望迎接莫洛托夫的演说。因为对他们说来，这是一个号召结成一个强有力的、不可战胜的阵营的召唤。”捷克斯拉夫“布拉斯”报说：“莫洛托夫演说，对于直到现在还以原子弹为其最后一张王牌的西方帝国主义，是一个重大打击。国际反动派力图降低莫洛托夫对原子弹声明所造成的印象，这是不足为奇的。”芬兰“斯诺迈德”报说：“苏联在上次大战中把许多国家的人民从法西斯奴役下解放出来，而今苏联又在战后时期中，进行反帝国主义侵略、保卫和平与民族独立的不可战胜的斗争。这就是为何它在一切国家，特别是广大工农阶层中有众多朋友的原因。全世界人民获悉莫洛托夫关于原子弹的声明，至感满意。”美国纽约“下午”报对莫洛托夫重提斯大林对史塔生所称“经济制度不同的国家可以互相合作”一点，表示欢迎。该报称：“莫洛托夫演说不仅表现了对苏维埃制度的信心，而且表现了与美国和平共处的愿望”。该报要求美国实行一种和平政策。并称：“美国在‘孜孜于制造战争新武器方面做得太多，假如对资本主义制度的信心大些，美国或者可能不致于这样着迷于毁灭性的手段”。该报并斥责杜威五日的演说称：“杜威暗示要使中国稳定，只须帮助腐败无能而卖国的国民党政府进行反共战争，就可以办到。这是一种最危险的欺骗。”纽约邮报与加拿大多伦多明星报也都强调莫洛托夫所称美苏可以合作一点，后者对苏联建设与战后复兴的成就表示赞仰，并在结论中称：千万人衷心渴望苏美合作。
