Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 10th: The textile industry in areas of central Hebei such as Gaoyang, Renqiu, Lixian, Anxin, and Qingyuan is flourishing. Statistics show that Gaoyang and Renqiu counties alone possess nearly 10,000 large and small textile iron machines and over 30,000 spinning wheels, capable of producing over 6,000 bolts of cloth of various colors daily. In Renqiu county, the number of men and women participating in textile production accounts for nearly 21% of the county's total population. The various types of wide fabric produced by weaving factories in Gaoyang, Anxin, Qingyuan, and other places are sold in central Hebei, southern Hebei, and the Bohai region, and are quite popular. The nineteen dyeing factories, including Gaoyang Zhongxing, have successfully used local materials and new methods to dye blue and indigo fabrics that are durable and do not fade, rivaling imported products. According to statistics from the Gaoyang Chamber of Commerce, using domestically produced dyes, the use of vulcanized blue alone can save as much as 14 billion yuan.

　　冀中纺业发达
    【新华社晋察冀十日电】冀中高阳、任邱、蠡县、安新、清苑等地纺织业蒸蒸日上，据统计，仅高阳、任邱两县即拥有大小纺织铁机近万架，纺车三万余辆，每日可产各色布六千余匹。任邱一县参加纺织生产之男女群众几占全县人口百分之二十一。高阳、安新、清苑等地织布厂出产之各色宽面布行销于冀中、冀南、渤海等地，颇受欢迎。高阳中兴等十九家染厂，试用土产新法染制青、蓝色布经久不落色，较之舶来品毫无逊色。据高阳商会统计，使用土产染色，单硫化青一项即可节省一百四十亿元之巨。
