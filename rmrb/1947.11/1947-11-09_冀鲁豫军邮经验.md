Since the beginning of the War of Self-Defense, the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region has been at the forefront of the war. To respond to the call from higher authorities, protect the interests of the people, and support the front lines in achieving victory in the war, the task before the postal service was to strengthen communication and provide cultural sustenance to the front lines. The postal workers of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region cheerfully undertook this glorious task and began to establish a military postal service. However, due to a lack of experience in this area in the past, they had to explore and experiment. Consequently, they often lost contact whenever the army made large-scale advances or retreats, and were unable to complete their tasks. Later, a meeting of military post office directors was convened to study and discuss the issue. Each participant shared their experiences, and everyone's opinions were gathered. The fundamental question was how to ensure continuous communication. After clarifying their thinking, everyone's confidence in their work was enhanced. After seven or eight months of hard work and careful study, the following experiences were gained: (1) It is essential to be familiar with our army's strategic guidelines and characteristics, which are to annihilate the enemy's active forces and not to focus on the temporary gains or losses of a single city or place, but rather on large-scale advances and retreats in mobile warfare. Based on this principle, the working principles for establishing the military postal service must be proactive, flexible, and swift in action in order to complete the tasks. (2) The military postal service must have a separate organizational structure and specially designated military postal lines. Relying on general postal services and lines will not solve the problem, given the characteristics of our army's combat operations. The military postal organization must be established separately and follow military movements; otherwise, contact will be lost when the army moves. In the initial stages, relying on supply stations without following the army also failed to solve the problem. The movements of the army are often not clear to the supply stations, and even if they knew, they could not forward the mail for us, resulting in backlog. After determining the principle of the military postal service following the army, the organizational structure was established, roughly divided as follows: A military postal general bureau was established at the highest command headquarters of the war in a region; a branch bureau was established in the column; a military post office was established in the brigade; and a military postal station was established in the regiment. These four levels of organization are sufficient. In terms of staffing, the general bureau has one director, one secretary, receiving and dispatching staff, and more postal workers, possibly 50 or even 80 or 90, depending on the situation. This is mainly because the military postal general bureau is responsible for contacting the administrative bureau, and sometimes the distance is very long, so several military postal stations must be set up in between. The tasks are heavy, so more manpower is needed. The branch bureau has one director, one receiving and dispatching staff, and six to ten postal workers. The military post office has one director who also serves as the receiving and dispatching staff, and four to six postal workers are sufficient. Generally, the contact area below the branch bureau is narrower and simpler, so less manpower is sufficient. As for mail below the regimental level, it can be delivered by internal personnel of the army. Recently, it was decided at the Propaganda Section Chiefs' meeting of the troops that agencies should be established in the regimental headquarters so that soldiers do not need to leave their company to mail letters. The company secretary is responsible for sending the mail from the company to the battalion and then to the regimental political department before transferring it to the military post office. In addition, the leadership of the military post office can be divided into two parts: administrative and technical. Administratively, each level of the bureau is under the political department of each level of the troops, and supplies and management are also provided by the troops; in terms of technical systems and procedures, they are guided by the postal system. All family members of employees participating in the military postal service who are in the rear enjoy the same treatment as military dependents. (3) The central link of the work - line communication. The line is the lifeline of the military postal service, and maintaining communication is the most important task. Ordinary local lines cannot be used; they must be laid out separately on a temporary basis according to the situation. It changes frequently as the army moves. In the initial stages, ordinary lines were borrowed, but many losses were suffered. Either the mail could not arrive in time, or the mail arrived but the troops had already left, or the mail was returned but the troops had returned. The experience is that a separate military postal organization must have specially designated lines, designed and controlled by the military postal service itself. Wherever the troops move, the line must be connected to that place, and everything must be subordinate to the actions of the troops in order to ensure smooth communication between the front and rear. The main method of contact is from bottom to top. The lower-level bureaus and stations must actively contact the higher-level ones, because the higher up, the more fixed it is. In order to avoid losing contact, each bureau must inform the postal workers of several contact points when they depart each day. Under normal circumstances, when the troops move, someone must be left at the point to wait. If the postal worker returns and finds that the original place is no longer there, they must look for it one by one and cannot skip points. In case of enemy activity, special personnel must be sent to meet them during the move to prevent postal workers from stepping into enemy territory on their return journey. All of the above must be constantly taught to employees to raise awareness.

    冀鲁豫军邮经验
    自卫战争开始后，冀鲁豫首先就处在战争最前线，为了响应上级号召，保卫人民利益，一切为了支援前线取得战争胜利，摆在邮政工作面前的任务即是加强通讯联络，供给前线文化食粮。冀鲁豫的邮政员工愉快地担负了这一光荣任务，着手创办军邮。但由于过去对于这一工作经验缺少，开始只好在摸索试验，故每在军队大踏步的进退大方向转移时，经常失掉联络，不能完成任务。后来召集了军邮局长开会，研究讨论，各自作过经验介绍，集中了大家意见，基本一个问题是如何保证联络，不使中断。大家思想上明确以后，提高了工作上的信心，经过七八个月来的艰苦奋斗，细心钻研，取得以下几个经验：（一）必须熟悉我军的战略方针和特点，是歼灭敌人有生力量，不在一城一地之暂时得失，大踏步前进与后退的运动作战。根据这一方针出发，建设军邮的工作原则就必须是主动、灵活与行动的迅速，才能完成任务。（二）军邮必须有单独组织机构和特设的军邮干线，依据我军作战行动的特点，死靠一般的邮务和干线是不能解决问题的。军邮组织必须另行建立，随从军事行止，否则，军队转移，就要失掉联络，初起不随同军队依靠兵站，也解决不了问题，往往军队的运动，兵站也不能随时搞清，即便知道也不能代我们转送，形成积压。确定了军邮随军的原则后，编制设立，大致划分如下：一个区域的战争最高指挥部设军邮总局，纵队设分局，旅设军邮局，团设军邮站，有这四层机构即可以。人员编制上，总局设局长一人，秘书一人，收发工人，邮工须要多些，五十甚至八九十人都可，这主要看情况而定，因军邮总局负责与管理局联系，有时距离拉得很长，中间必须设若干军邮站，任务繁重动力必须要多。分局设局长一人收发一人，邮工六至十人。军邮局设局长兼收发一人，邮工四至六人即可，分局以下一般联系面窄，较单纯，动力少些也够用。至于团以下的邮件，可由军队内部人员传递，最近决定经部队宣教科长会议确定了团部成立代办处，战士寄信不出连队，由连书记负责送营至团政治处再转军邮局。此外，军邮局的领导，可分行政与技术两部分：行政上各级局统归各阶部队政治部，供给管理也由部队；技术制度手续方面归邮政系统指导。凡参加军邮工作的员工家属在后方者一律享受军属待遇。（三）工作的中心一环——干线联络，干线是军邮工作的命脉，保持联系是最主要的工作，不能凑用地方干线，必须依据情况，临时单另铺设，它是随着军队移动，而常常变动着，初起也曾借用普通干线，但受过很多损失，不是邮件不能即时到达，便是邮件已到部队走了，有时邮件退转了，部队又返回来。经验是，单另的军邮机构，必须有特设的干线，由军邮本身自己来设计掌握。部队转移到那里，干线就得与那里接上，一切服从部队的行动，才能保证前后方的畅通。联系的方式方法，主要是自下而上，下边的局站要主动与上边取得联络，因为越往上它得固定性越大。为了避免失掉联系，各局每天在邮工出发时，告以几个联络点，一般情况下部队转移，点上要留人等候，邮工回来看原地不在，一定逐一去找，不能越点行进。如遇敌情，又必须在移动时派出专人迎接，以免邮工返回途中踏入敌阵。以上这些必须对员工随时教育，提高认识。
