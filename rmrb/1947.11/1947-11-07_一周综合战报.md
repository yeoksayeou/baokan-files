    Weekly Comprehensive Battle Report
    October 30th to November 5th
    From October 30th to November 5th, the People's Liberation Army continued its victorious offensive on all fronts. In the intervals between battles, they conducted training, studied land reform, assisted farmers in newly liberated areas to overturn their lives, distributed grain and land, consolidated positions, and prepared to deliver even greater blows to Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops.
    Northern Front: The Northeast Democratic Allied Army achieved successive victories on both the northern and southern fronts. On the morning of the 3rd, a unit of the Allied Army annihilated the majority of the KMT's Provisional 56th Division (reorganized from the Northeast Security First District troops) and a portion of the HuaiDe Security Regiment, totaling over 2,000 men, south of Changchun and northwest of Gongzhuling. On the southern front, a unit of the Jireliao (Hebei-Chahar-Rehe-Liaoning) Liberation Army completely routed two KMT divisions in the Jiuguantaimen area west of Yixian from the 1st to the 2nd, inflicting a devastating blow on the 21st Division of the 92nd Army, killing Deputy Division Commander Li Youzong and capturing Division Commander Guo Huicang, Chief of Staff Ji Gaoxiang, and over 3,000 others. Furthermore, a unit of the Allied Army annihilated two battalions of the 52nd Army in Xiaotunzi, east of Liaoyang, on the 25th. Local armed forces in eastern Hebei and southern Rehe successively captured Daxinzhuang, southeast of Tangshan on the Beining Railway, and YingShouYing, a major town on the outskirts of Chengde.
    After the Jin-Cha-Ji (Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei) People's Liberation Army annihilated over 17,000 Chiang bandits in Qingfengdian and north of Baoding, Shijiazhuang has become an isolated island on land, teetering on the brink of collapse. The entire defensive posture of the Chiang bandits is increasingly passive. Tianjin, Beijing, and Baoding are constantly threatened by our counter-offensive forces, while our army is even more mobile and can freely choose targets and deliver powerful blows at any time.
    Southern Front: Following the great victory at Qingjian, the Northwest People's Liberation Army seized the opportunity to recover Suide, an important town in northern Shaanxi, and Wayaobao, a strategic location. By this point, there were no enemy traces in the liberated areas east and north of Yan'an. Our army has completed a horseshoe encirclement around the Chiang-Hu bandit troops trapped in the isolated city of Yan'an. The Jin-Sui (Shanxi-Suiyuan) Liberation Army, on the 27th, liberated Ji County for the first time, the long-time lair of the traitor Yan Xishan. The Hu bandit Zongnan had heavily defended this vital transportation hub between Shanxi and Shaanxi, but after the successive capture of cities like Yanchang and Yichuan by our forces, the Hu bandits fled without a fight.
    The Eyuwan (Hubei-Henan-Anhui) People's Liberation Army captured Lishan City in eastern Hubei and Xuanhuaidian, the former capital of the Eyuwan border region during the War of Resistance Against Japan. Since the counter-offensive army successfully entered the Dabie Mountains and the Eyuwan region, it has fought east and west, overcoming numerous difficulties, and has not only gained a firm foothold but also completed its strategic deployment and begun to enter a consolidation phase. In the past two months, a total of more than 33,000 Chiang bandit troops have been annihilated, and 24 county towns have been liberated successively. Thirty-three patriotic democratic county governments and military district administrative offices at various levels have been established. Wherever the Liberation Army goes, it helps the farmers distribute grain and wealth and carry out land distribution, and helps establish armed forces to protect the fruits of the farmers' emancipation. The facts of the past two months provide valuable experience: it is entirely possible for the People's Liberation Army to conduct operations without rear support in Chiang-controlled areas and achieve victory.
    The Su-Lu-Yu-Wan (Jiangsu-Shandong-Henan-Anhui) Liberation Army continues to repeatedly sweep away Chiang bandits on the vast plains of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu. Since the 27th of last month, it has successively captured Shangcai, Huaiyang, Woyang, Xincai, Mengcheng, and Boxian, six county towns. The only six provincial security regiments in Henan Province of the Chiang bandits have been annihilated by the Liberation Army. Kaifeng City, guarded by Liu Maoen, chairman of Henan Province of the Chiang bandits, is also in imminent danger under the powerful offensive of the Liberation Army. Since the Chen-Su counter-offensive army crossed the Longhai Railway to the south and launched a large-scale offensive, it has swept across a vast plain of over a thousand miles east to west and over six hundred miles north to south, west of Hongze Lake, east of the Pinghan Railway, and north of the Huai River, sweeping away Chiang's troops and the Chiang regime, annihilating nearly 10,000 Chiang security forces, and capturing 25 county towns and dozens of important towns. In addition to the three democratic administrative offices established in Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, south of the Longhai Railway, west of the Jinpu Railway, and north of the Wo River and the Dasha River, with a population of over 10 million, there are a total of six administrative offices with a population of over 20 million. Among them, eight million farmers have been allocated land, and the emancipated farmers are supporting and participating in the Liberation Army with unparalleled enthusiasm. The Chen-Su army is now coordinating operations with the Liu-Deng and Chen-Xie armies, making it difficult for the Chiang bandits to support the south and rescue the north, making it easy for the Liberation Army to choose the fattest targets.
    In addition, our armies in Jiaodong and Yu-Shaan (Henan-Shaanxi) continue to seize opportunities and seek to annihilate the enemy. After Zhang Gonggan, commander of the 356th Regiment of the 29th Brigade of the 68th Division, led his entire regiment to revolt in the area besieged in western Shandong, recently the Second Special Company of the Fourth Pacification Zone of Liu Ruming's KMT forces, under the leadership of Company Commander Zhang Fuhai and Deputy Company Commander Xiao Shoutian, revolted in its entirety and entered the liberated area.

    一周综合战报
    十月三十日至十一月五日
    三十日至五日，人民解放军在各线继续胜利攻势，并在战隙进行练兵，学习土改，协助新区农民进行翻身运动，分粮分田，巩固阵地，准备给蒋匪军的更大的打击。
    北线方面：东北民主联军南北两线相继告捷，三日晨联军一部于长春以南，公主岭西北歼灭蒋军暂五十六师（原东北保安第一区部队改编）大部及怀德保安团一部共二千余人。南线冀察热辽解放军一部，于一日至二日于义县以西九关台门地区彻底击溃蒋军两个师，并予其中之九十二军二十一师以歼灭性打击，毙伤蒋军二十一师副师长李有宗，俘该师师长郭惠苍，师参谋长纪高翔以下共三千余人。另联军一部于二十五日，在辽阳东小屯子歼灭蒋军五十二军两个营。冀东热南地方武装连克北宁线唐山东南大新庄与承德外围之鹰手营大重镇。
    晋察冀人民解放军自清风店及保（定）北歼蒋匪一万七千余人后，石家庄已成陆上孤岛，摇摇欲坠，蒋匪整个防御更陷于被动，平津保随时处于我反攻大军威胁之下，而我军则更为机动，可以任意随时选择目标，予以有力打击。
    南线方面：西北人民解放军继清涧大捷后，乘胜收复陕北重镇绥德与战略要地瓦窑堡两城。至此延安以东及以北解放区内已无敌踪，我军对困守延安孤城之蒋胡匪军，已完成马蹄包围形势。晋绥解放军，则于二十七日首次解放阎逆锡山盘踞多年之老巢吉县城，胡匪宗南曾以重兵防守此晋陕交通要地，但以延长、宜川等城相继为我攻占，胡匪不战而逃。
    鄂豫皖我解放军攻克鄂东之礼山城，及抗日战争时期鄂豫皖边区首府所在地宣化店。反攻大军自顺利进入大别山鄂豫皖区域以后，东战西征，克服诸多困难，现在不仅站稳了脚跟，而且已完成了战略展开，开始进入巩固阶段。两个月来，共计歼灭蒋匪军三万三千余人，先后解放了二十四座县城，已建立了三十三个爱国民主县政府。及军区专署等各级军事政治机构。解放军每到一处，即帮助农民分粮分财及进行分田，并帮助成立武装以保卫农民的翻身果实。两个月来的事实提供了宝贵的经验：人民解放军深入蒋管区进行无后方的作战到取得胜利，是完全可能的。
    苏鲁豫皖解放军往来豫皖苏大平原上，继续反复扫荡蒋匪，于上月廿七日以来，连克上蔡、淮阳、涡阳、新蔡、蒙城、亳县等六县城，蒋匪河南省仅有之六个省保安团，已被解放军先后歼灭殆尽。蒋匪河南省主席刘茂恩负责看守的开封城，亦处于解放军强大攻势下，岌岌可危。溯自陈粟反攻大军南越陇海路，展开大规模攻势作战后，一月来席卷洪泽湖以西、平汉路东、淮河以北，东西千余里，南北六百余里的广大平原，纵横扫荡蒋军蒋政权，歼灭蒋保安团队近万人，攻克县城二十五座，及重要市镇数十处，几度截断津浦、陇海两铁路，除豫皖苏在陇海路南、津浦路西、涡河与大沙河以北建立之三个民主专署，辖人口一千余万，共计有六个专署，两千余万人口。其中有八百万农民已分得了土地，翻身农民以无比热情支援与参加解放军，现陈粟大军已与刘邓、陈谢大军呼应作战，使蒋匪南援北救，顾此失彼，便于解放军择肥而食。
    此外，胶东、豫陕我军继续捕捉战机，寻求歼敌。困踞鲁西歼敌继六十八师二九旅三五六团张公干团长率全团人马起义后，最近复有蒋军刘汝明第四绥区特务第二连，在正副连长张福海，萧守田领导下全部起义，开入解放区。
