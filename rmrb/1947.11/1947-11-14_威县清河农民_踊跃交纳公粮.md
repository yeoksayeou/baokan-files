　　Weixian Qinghe Peasants Enthusiastically Pay Public Grain
    [Report from our Jinnan Office, 10th] To support the front lines in defeating old Jiang, the Shaojia Na brigade rushes to thresh and hand over public grain. After Shaojia Na Village in the Second District of Qinghe announced the autumn tax, the four groups including Shao Chuanzeng discussed: "Our soldiers on the front lines are shedding blood to protect our victorious achievements. These good days are all exchanged for by the lives of the soldiers on the front lines. Let's quickly thresh the millet and dry it. As soon as they say it's time to pay, let's all hand it over together." The four groups worked hard for ten days, threshing and drying the millet, just waiting for the tax collection to begin. At a mass meeting, the masses jointly decided: each of the four groups should be given a major commendation. The emancipated peasants of Xuguzhai Village in the Second District of Weixian enthusiastically pay autumn offensive grain. Since the district arranged autumn plowing, the village convened a mass meeting to notify everyone to prepare, putting forward slogans such as "No grits, no chaff, support the front lines in defeating old Jiang" and "Thresh early, pay quickly, and strive to be a model for grain payment". The masses were extremely enthusiastic and discussed it. For example, the newly promoted middle peasant Wang Laowen said: "We must clean the grain well and must not adulterate it or make up the numbers." Poor peasant Shi Rumei said: "This is paying grain to our army, we must pay good grain so that our army can eat their fill and defeat old Jiang." Every household was busy threshing and drying grain. Some helped each other to plant wheat and thresh together, combining planting wheat with other work during the day and threshing at night. Shi Junling said: "We will prepare the grain early, and when it's time to pay, we will hand it over quickly, striving to be a model and also ensuring that the grain is clean and not fake." On the morning of the 20th, as soon as the loudspeaker announced "Tax collection begins", each family pushed and carried, vying to send it to the village office. Some paid three or two more catties and voluntarily gave them up. The payers continued one after another. In a little over a day, the entire village's public grain was paid and sent to the district.

　　威县清河农民  踊跃交纳公粮
    【本报冀南十日电】支援前线打老蒋，邵家那突击打场缴公粮。清河二区邵家那村宣布秋征后，邵传增等四组酝酿说：“咱们前方的战士拼命流血，保卫咱的胜利果实，这样的好日子，都是前方战士拿命换来的。咱们赶快将谷子打好晒干，一说缴时，咱一齐交上”。四组突击十天，谷子打完晒干，单等开征。群众会上，群众共同议决：给他四个组各记一大功。威县二区徐固寨翻身农民踊跃缴纳秋季反攻粮。自区布置秋耕后，该村即召开群众会，通知大家准备，提出：“没有砂子没有糠，支援前线打老蒋”“早打快缴争作缴粮模范”等口号，群众情绪极高，纷纷议论。如新升中农王老文说：“咱们要把粮食弄干净，一定不能掺假凑数。”贫农石汝梅说：“这是给咱们的军队纳粮，一定要缴好粮，叫咱们军队吃饱，好打老蒋。”家家户户忙于打场、晒干粮。有的互助起来种麦打场互相结合，白天种麦做别的活，晚上打场。石君灵说：“咱早早把粮食准备好，缴时咱就很快交上了，争个模范，还保证粮食干净没假。”于二十号早晨喇叭筒一喊“开征了”，各家推的推，扛的扛，争先恐后往村公所里送。有的多缴三斤二斤，就自动不要了。缴者陆续不断。一天多，全村公粮缴完送区。
