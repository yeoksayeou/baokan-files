　　Hebei-Shandong-Henan Sixth District Five Thousand Million Yuan Loan
　　Most Loans Given to Poor Peasants and Hired Laborers, Increasing Wheat Planting by 70,000 Mu
　　People on the North Bank of the Yellow River Conquer Floods
　　Dredging Water and Planting Wheat on Nearly 10,000 Qing
[Report from our newspaper in Hebei-Shandong-Henan on the 22nd] The Sixth District, thanks to a loan of 50 million yuan, enabled 5,000 households to obtain seeds, increasing the wheat planting area by 70,000 mu. After the Sixth Branch of the Hebei-South Henan Bank decided to issue wheat seed loans of 50 million yuan in early October, the counties, in order to promptly distribute the loans to the people and not delay the wheat planting season, and through the efforts of the county leaders, distributed all the loans in half a month. A total of 449 villages and 5,851 households were helped to solve the problem of wheat seeds (purchasing a total of 398,077 jin and 12 liang of wheat seeds). The composition of this loan is as follows: 5,680 households were loaned to poor peasants (newly promoted middle peasants), accounting for 96% of the total of 5,851 households; 171 households were loaned to middle peasants, accounting for 4%. In terms of loan amount, poor peasants received 48,130,650.08 yuan, accounting for 97% of the total loan amount. This greatly helped the basic masses who had newly obtained land but did not have wheat seeds, providing them with production capital and increasing their income. Let's look at the fifth and sixth districts of Dong'a County: The two districts loaned to 261 households, who planted a total of 2,190 mu of wheat this year. They solved the problem of wheat seeds for 598.75 mu themselves, and used loans to buy wheat seeds for planting on 1,596.21 mu, accounting for 72% of the total wheat planting area. During this loan distribution, cadres personally went to the villages to understand the situation, held village meetings, first the masses reported their difficulties, and then the meeting discussed and evaluated, and implemented three guarantees (i.e., guarantee to use the loan to plant wheat, guarantee to lend to the basic masses who do not have wheat seeds, and guarantee to repay on time). In the process of this loan distribution, the leaders further realized that there are still many difficulties in the current mass production, breaking the subjective idea of some people that the masses have no difficulties after land reform. After the loan, many people said: "If it weren't for the loan, we wouldn't be able to plant wheat!"

[Report from our newspaper in Hebei-Shandong-Henan on the 21st] The rivers and canals north of the Yellow River in Hebei-Shandong-Henan are interconnected, and they are also in a war environment. All ditches, canals and dikes have been destroyed by the enemy puppets, and are silted up and in disrepair, resulting in flooding whenever there is heavy rain. Last year, the entire district was flooded by more than 100,000 qing. This year, the flooded area (counties north of the Yellow River) is initially estimated at more than 70,000 qing. The reduced grain harvest from the flooded land in the past two years is estimated at 100 jin per mu, which is 150 million jin. Since last autumn, after investigation, measurement, and design, construction of rivers began in Nanle and Nanfeng this summer, opening the first shot of water management. This autumn, in order to meet the urgent needs of the masses, and in response to the call of the District Party Committee and Administrative Office to "release water and plant wheat," a mass-based water management upsurge has formed from the bottom up. According to incomplete statistics, the area of autumn seedlings exempted from flooding and the area of wheat fields expanded through river excavation and water diversion are as follows: (1) Dredging rivers and digging ditches totaled 2,383 qing of autumn seedlings exempted from flooding (2,000 qing in Nanle, 80 qing in the northwest depressions and waterlogged depressions in Yanggu and Zhangqiu, 70 qing in the Dongchengkou depression in Yanggu, and 233 qing in Renping). (2) A total of 2,668 qing of land dried up after water was released (1,100 qing in Baijiawa, Liuchizi, and Nanwa in Zhuxian; 500 qing in the third and ninth districts of Yanggu; 500 qing in the fifth and sixth districts of Shouzhang; 300 qing in the fifth district of Qingfeng; 343 qing in Renping; 25 qing in Gaoling; and 400 qing in the second district of Fanxian). (3) A total of 4,700 qing of land can be dried up by releasing water (2,700 qing in Zhaocunpo in Puyang County; 1,500 qing in Nei Huang, Wei River, and Xiao River slopes; and 500 qing in the second and third districts of Qingfeng, and the fourth district of Guancheng). The above-mentioned area of autumn seedlings exempted from flooding and the area that has been dried up and can be dried up by releasing water totals 9,751 qing. (4) South of the Jin Dike, in the six counties of Shou, Fan, Pu, Kun, Yang, and Hua, more than 7,000 qing of waterlogged land has been released into the Grand Canal in Zhangqiu. Most of the 9,000+ qing exempted from flooding and dried up have been planted with wheat, guaranteeing an increase in wheat harvest next year, and strengthening our counter-offensive strength.

　　冀鲁豫六分区五千万元贷款
    大部贷给贫雇农增加种麦七万亩   
    黄河北岸群众战胜水患
    疏水种麦近万顷
    【本报冀鲁豫二十二日电】六分区由于贷款五千万元，使五千户群众得到种籽，增加种麦面积七万亩。十月上旬，冀南银行六分行决定发放麦种贷款五千万元之后，各县为了把贷款及时贷到群众手里，不误种麦季节，经各县负责人的努力，在半月中即将贷款全部发下，共解决了四百四十九村，五千八百五十一户群众麦种（共买三十九万八千零七十七斤十二两麦种）困难。此次贷款成份统计如下：贷给贫农（新升中农）五千六百八十户，占贷款总户数五千八百五十一户的百分之九十六；中农一百七十一户，占百分之四。款数比例是，贫农得到款数四千八百十三万零六千五百零八元，占贷款总数的百分之九十七。因此大大帮助了新得土地而没麦种的基本群众，使他们有了生产资本，增加收入。我们再从东阿县五、六区来看：两区贷款户为二百六十一户，今年共种麦二千一百九十亩，自己解决麦种五百九十八亩七分五厘，用贷款买麦种种麦一千五百九十六亩二分一厘，占总种麦地亩数百分之七十二。此次发放贷款中，干部亲自到村了解情况，召开村民大会，先由群众自报困难，然后大会评议，并实行三保证（即保证贷款种麦、保证贷给没有麦种的基本群众、保证按期归还）。在此次发放贷款过程中，使领导上进一步体验到目前群众生产仍存在着很多困难，打破某些人认为土改后群众没有困难的主观想法。在贷款后，很多人说：“要不是贷款，咱们就种不上麦子！”
    【本报冀鲁豫二十一日电】冀鲁豫黄河以北河渠交流，又处于战争环境，所有沟渠堤岸多经敌伪破坏，淤塞失修，致每逢大雨即遭水淹，去年全区淹地十万余顷，今年淹地（黄河以北各县），初步统计达七万余顷，这两年来淹地减收食粮，每亩以百斤计，就是十五万万斤。从去秋起，经调查、测量、设计，在今夏南乐、南峰已动工挖河，打开了治水头一炮，今秋各地为满足群众的迫切要求，响应区党委、行署“放水种麦”的号召，形成了自下而上的群众性治水热潮。据目前不完全的统计，经挖河顺水，免淹秋苗及扩大麦地面积如下：（一）浚河挖沟，共计免淹秋苗地二千三百八十三顷（南乐二千顷，阳谷、张秋西北洼、积水洼八十顷，阳谷东程口洼七十顷，荏平二百三十三顷）。（二）放水后涸干之地共二千六百六十八顷（筑先白家洼、刘池子、南洼共一千一百顷；阳谷三、九区；寿张五、六区共五百顷；清丰五区三百顷；荏平三百四十三顷；高陵二十五顷；范县二区四百顷）。（三）经放水能涸干的地，共计四千七百顷（濮县赵村坡二千七百顷；内黄、卫河、硝河坡一千五百顷；清丰二、三区、观城四区五百顷）。以上经放水免淹秋苗和已涸干及能涸干之地共九千七百五十一顷。（四）金堤以南寿、范、濮、昆、阳、滑六县，积水地七千余顷，已在张秋放水入运河。免淹及涸干之九千多顷，大半已种麦，保证明年增加麦收，加强了我反攻的力量。
