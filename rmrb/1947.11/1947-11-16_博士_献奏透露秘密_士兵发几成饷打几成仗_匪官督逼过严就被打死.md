Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀, November 13th: The People's Liberation Army seized a telegram from the Chiang bandit's "2508 Unit" during the Qingfengdian annihilation battle. This telegram was an excerpt from a secret memorial to the Chiang bandit army's supreme command from a so-called "Researcher Shi Zixing, Doctor of the Beiping Scientific Research Institute," entitled "Observations on the Ping-Bao Line." This "Doctor Shi Zixing," who offered advice to the Chiang bandit supreme command, revealed to some extent the seriousness of the Chiang bandit military crisis. Here are several excerpts: "With strong enemies in front, soldiers are deserting one after another. Those unfortunately seriously injured have their clothes stripped off by their comrades and are abandoned. Those who are lightly injured and manage to be transported back become disabled due to malnutrition and careless treatment, and can only become beggars." "Recently, soldiers have also become cunning, fighting according to the percentage of pay received. No matter how the bugler blows the charge, who is willing to risk their lives? If the officers supervise too strictly, they will be shot to death." "The elite Communist army's combat tactics are unpredictable, using the few to control the many, striking in the east and attacking in the west, appearing and disappearing mysteriously, and blending in with the local people. Our army (referring to the Chiang bandits) dares not enter a village without repeated reconnaissance, for fear of the unexpected." "When 'National Army' (referring to the Chiang bandits) soldiers are captured by the Communist army, they are treated the same as the Communist soldiers, and the wounded are treated. They are free to leave or stay as they wish. Those who stay become more fighters, and those who are sent back become more propagandists, enough to disturb our (Chiang bandit) morale." "The treatment of officers and soldiers (referring to Chiang bandit officers and soldiers) is unspeakably miserable. Except for battalion commanders and above who have special income, the rest, from company commanders down, feel that life is difficult. Military rations are not issued on time, and after several deductions, the quantity is not only insufficient, but the quality is also poor. Three meals a day are half-cooked, with a lot of sand in the rice, making it difficult to chew. They only have pickled vegetables to eat, which is barely enough to half-fill their stomachs. As for the higher-level officers, they rarely meet with the lower ranks, and there is no special feeling between officers and soldiers."

　　“博士”献奏透露秘密
  　士兵发几成饷打几成仗
    匪官督逼过严就被打死
    【新华社晋察冀十三日电】解放军于清风店歼灭战中缴获蒋匪“第二五○八部队”代电一份，该电系摘抄所谓“北平科学研究社研究员石子兴博士”给蒋匪军最高统帅部的一摺秘密奏本，题名“平保线见闻记”。这个向蒋匪统帅部献策的“石子兴博士”多少道出了蒋匪军事危机的严重性。现照抄数段如下：“强敌当前，士兵多相继逃亡，不幸受重伤者，同伍弟兄即将衣服剥去，遗弃不管。其负轻伤侥幸得以运回者，则以营养不良，医治潦草，每成残废，只有流为乞丐一途。”“近来士兵亦变为狡猾，发几成饷，打几成仗，尽管号兵吹冲锋号，谁愿卖命？若长官督促过严，即举枪而毙之。”“精锐共军作战变化莫测，以寡御众，声东击西，神出鬼没，与当地民众打成一片。我军（指蒋匪）每到一地，非再三侦察不敢进入村内一步，以防不测。”“国军”（指蒋匪）被共军俘虏时，对于士兵与共军一样看待，对于受伤者则为治疗，愿去愿留，各听其便，盖留者多一斗士，遣回者多一宣传员，足以扰我（蒋匪）军心也。”“军士（按指蒋匪官兵）待遇苦不堪言，除营长以上有特别收入外，其余自连长以下俱感生活困难，军粮又不能按时发放，几经克扣，不特数量不足，质亦恶劣，每日三餐，半生不熟，饭内沙粒极多，咀嚼为难，日以碱菜佐食，仅可半饱。至于上级官长亦极少晤面，官兵之间，无特别感情可言。”
