    [Report from our newspaper in the Jilu Yu region, 29th] After the recovery of Yun, Juan, and Linze areas, distributing the autumn harvest and wheat planting became the urgent demand of the masses. This year's autumn harvest was generally bountiful, so the masses were exceptionally jubilant, but many masses had not truly turned themselves around, still living lives of little clothing and food. The masses in Ren Huaizhuang in the first district of Yuncheng only received a small portion of land, with more than two qing of land still being cultivated by landlords. The poor peasant Zhou Huoniang and her husband had two mu of land but did not receive any land in the land reform. When the reporter spoke with her, she said, "Don't mention distribution, I haven't been distributed anything. The village cadres said today that they would distribute land, tomorrow they would distribute land, it's been so long, I haven't even received a fart!" In the western fields of Dingzhuang Village in the fifth district, more than two qing of soybeans were already ripe but no one harvested them. The village cadres said, "That is the land of the landlord Ding, it was originally distributed, but because he became a 'Returning Home Corps' member, the masses dare not take it." In some villages in the fifth district, the land has not yet been distributed, after confiscation, the village cadres found someone to rent it out. In Wangying, there are still more than two qing of wasteland, covered with weeds. The masses in Zhang Hutong in the fourth district distributed the landlord's land, but the cotton they planted was still picked by the landlord. The landlord dared not put the picked cotton in his own home, after weighing it, he put it in the home of the poor peasant who had been distributed the land. The landlord told the poor peasant, "When the Anti-Japanese Federation asks, you say the cotton was picked by you, and you still have to give it to me later." It is clearly distributed but secretly not distributed. Some are still paying rent to the landlord. The struggles in some villages in Linze are fake, with the landlord giving a few mu of bad or remote land to the masses. Therefore, since the environment has improved after our recovery compared to the past guerrilla warfare period, and it is the autumn harvest and wheat planting season, the masses have an urgent demand to distribute the autumn harvest, distribute land, and adjust good land. The masses in Wang Feizhuang in Linze have already risen up to exchange good land with landlords to distribute the autumn harvest. The distribution of the autumn harvest and wheat planting is currently underway.

    [Report from our newspaper in the Jilu Yu region, 30th] In the newly recovered area of Yuncheng, a celebration of victory and counter-offensive, memorial, and public trial meeting was held on October 14th. Four thousand people attended. The martyrs' monument stood tall in the center of the stage, with the names of forty-one martyrs written on it. After three cannon salutes, the meeting solemnly opened. After the chairman reported the significance of the meeting, the county magistrate and county party committee spoke, pointing out the atrocities of the Chiang army in Yuncheng. Everyone has suffered a lot, we must transform grief and anger into strength. In order to ensure the victory of the counter-offensive, we must actively plant wheat, thoroughly carry out land reform, and support the front lines. Then, the mass representative Wang Siyin said, "Before, when the Chiang army was here, the only ones who could speak were the bad 'Returning Home Corps' members and the landlords wearing礼帽 and blowing胡子. Now our farmers can speak, we must avenge those martyrs who sacrificed for us!" Then, the director of the Armed Forces Committee reported the deeds of the forty-one martyrs who sacrificed for the interests of the masses in the guerrilla war: Comrade Jiang Wennan, eighteen years old, died in battle with the enemy; Comrade Wang Lanquan, a woman, was captured by the enemy, subjected to cruel beatings, and never yielded, finally sacrificing heroically, etc. Their loyalty, courage, and steadfast spirit are worthy of everyone's study. Immediately afterward, a public trial was held for the heinous "Returning Home Corps" members Yu Tianshun, Guo Guizhong, and four others. Yu Tianshun and Yu Ge were from a hooligan bandit background, killed the families of district cadres in the enemy's sixth district team, offered four of our big guns to the enemy, raped women, and suppressed the masses. Guo Guizhong and Guo Gai defrauded the people of four thousand jin of grain, sold it for five million yuan in current currency, and relied on their power to suppress the masses. After they were dealt with by the masses at the public trial, the people were very happy.

    郓鄄等地新收复区
    群众起来分秋种麦
    郓城四千人追悼烈士公审奸霸
    【本报冀鲁豫二十九日电】郓、鄄、临泽等地收复后，分秋种麦为群众迫切要求。今年的大秋普遍丰收，因此群众异常欢腾，但还有不少群众没有真正得到翻身，仍过着少衣无食的生活。郓城一区任怀庄的群众，仅仅分得很少一部分土地，尚有两顷多地仍属地主耕种，贫农周火娘两口人有二亩地，土改中没有分到一分土地，当记者和她谈时，她说：“别提分啦，啥也没分过，村里干部今天说分地，明天说分地，怎长时间啦，我连个屁也没分到！”五区丁庄村西地里，有两顷多豆子已经熟透了，也没人收割，该庄村干部说：“那是地主丁某的地，本来分了，因他当了‘还乡团’，群众不敢要。”五区有些村的地还没分，没收后，村干找人租出去了。在王营还有两顷多荒地，遍长野草。四区张胡同群众分的地主的地，种的棉花仍旧是地主拾，地主拾了棉花不敢放在自己家里，用秤秤后放在分地的贫农家里，地主告诉贫农说：“抗联里要问时，你就说花是你拾的，以后还得给我。”是明分暗不分。有些是仍旧向地主交租。临泽有些村的斗争是假的，地主拿出几亩孬地、远地分给群众，因此当我收复后，环境比过去游击战时好了，又是秋收种麦季节，群众有分秋分地调剂好地的迫切要求，临泽王非庄的群众已起来，向地主换好地分秋，现分秋种麦正在开展中。
    【本报冀鲁豫三十日电】新收复区郓城，十月十四日召开祝捷反攻、追悼、公审大会。到会四千人，台上烈士碑挺立在正中，上面写着四十一名烈士的名字。鸣炮三响后，大会隆重揭幕，主席报告开会意义后，县长县委讲话，指出蒋军在郓城的暴行，大家受了很多苦难，我们要化悲愤为力量。为着保证反攻的胜利，要积极种麦，彻底进行土改和支援前线。继有群众代表王司因说：“以前蒋军在这里时，能讲话的是坏蛋‘还乡团’和戴礼帽吹胡子的地主，现在咱庄稼人能讲话了，我们要为那些为我们牺牲的烈士报仇！”继由武委会主任，报告在游击战中为群众利益牺牲的四十一名烈士殉难事迹：十八岁的姜文南同志，在与敌人遭遇时，拼刺刀而殉职；王兰泉女同志，被敌人捉去，受到残酷的鞭打终未屈服，最后英勇牺牲等。他们忠勇坚贞的精神，值得大家学习。紧接着，公审罪大恶极的“还乡团”于天顺、郭贵忠等六名，于天顺于阁人，流氓土匪出身，在敌伪六区队杀区干部的家属，向敌献我大枪四支，强奸妇女，镇压群众；郭贵忠、郭垓人，倒算粮食四千斤，卖现洋法币五百万元，仗势镇压群众。他们在公审大会上，被群众处理后，人心大快。
