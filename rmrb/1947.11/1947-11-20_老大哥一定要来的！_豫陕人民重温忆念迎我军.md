　　The Elder Brother Must Come!
　　The People of Henan and Shaanxi Relive Memories and Welcome Our Army
   (I)
   　　This spring, when our New Fourth Army's Fifth Division was transferring, a soldier in a certain sub-district's guard company fell ill and could not march with them. General Li Xiannian, speaking to him and other comrades who were staying behind, called on the Communist Party members: "Always remember that in times of hardship and difficulty, whether begging for food or working as a hired hand, do not forget or disgrace the glorious title of Communist Party member." He also said: "Soon the Elder Brother (the Eighth Route Army) will come to pick you up."
   　　After this soldier recovered, he became a hired hand for a landlord and suffered hardships he had never experienced before. However, he did not waver or become discouraged, and he always looked forward to the "Elder Brother" coming quickly. When the People's Liberation Army arrived in Shangluo Town this time, he was working in the fields. As soon as he heard the news, he didn't even bother to eat and ran all the way to the town. Upon seeing the People's Liberation Army, he said with tears in his eyes:
   　　"Our division commander was right, the Elder Brother really came to pick us up."
   (II)
   　　The people of southern Shaanxi, completely isolated from the outside world, from the civil war to the War of Resistance Against Japan, to the transfer of General Li Xiannian's troops, the people's army had entered and exited southern Shaanxi eight times. The local people had suffered eight massacres by the reactionaries, but the people firmly believed that "the Elder Brother must come." This sentence powerfully encouraged the fighting spirit of the people of southern Shaanxi. They learned about the news of Chen Xie's army crossing to the south from the frantic screams of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' Xi'an newspapers. The dozens of guerrilla units scattered throughout southern Shaanxi became a hundred times more excited and active. For a time, the news that the People's Liberation Army had arrived spread throughout southern Shaanxi. Slogans such as "Southern Shaanxi People's Liberation Army" appeared in many strongholds garrisoned by Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits' henchmen, the village chiefs and bailiffs, were frightened several times a day, unable to find a "safe" place to hide. In fact, at that time, the People's Liberation Army was still five hundred miles away on the Longhai Railway.
   　　As the People's Liberation Army advanced along the road from Lushi to Luonan, Comrade Wang Li sent out more than a dozen groups of guerrillas to wait for the People's Liberation Army at major road junctions. A certain democratic county magistrate, who had persevered through the enemy's "encirclement and suppression," also walked one hundred and eighty *li* to welcome the army. Some guerrillas brought simple letters saying: "Eighth Route Army comrades, when you attack Shangzhou, go to a certain village to find a certain person to make contact, they can lead the way." A certain commander of the People's Liberation Army greatly valued these guerrillas, calling them "living maps."
   　　On the Mid-Autumn Festival, the guerrilla team led by Comrade Wang Li met the main force in Shangluo Town. The People's Liberation Army was riding in cars seized near Longjuzhai. It was market day, and the town was crowded with jubilant people. Three farmers in their fifties, brought melons and fruits to see Comrade Wang Li. They said: "You have brought the sun to us, and Shangluo Town has also seen the sun." Comrade Wang Li, seeing the majestic ranks of our army, the row upon row of cannons, and the jubilation of the masses, and thinking of the comrades who had sacrificed themselves for the cause of the people's liberation during the arduous struggle, was filled with emotion and also shed tears of excitement.
   　　The people along the Dan River used every means to help the People's Liberation Army. Once, when our army was heading east from Shangnan, it was raining heavily, and the river water had risen to chest height. A woman in her twenties from ×× Village, braving the heavy rain, waded back and forth across the rushing river more than ten times to help transport things and support the weaker soldiers across the river. Seeing that her clothes were ragged, the People's Liberation Army offered her a *dou* of wheat, but she repeatedly declined to accept it, saying, "I am the director of the women's association here. Since you left, we have suffered enough! It's not much to help a little now that the troops have finally returned." As she spoke, she couldn't help but shed tears of excitement.

### 老大哥一定要来的！　豫陕人民重温忆念迎我军

　　老大哥一定要来的！
  　豫陕人民重温忆念迎我军
    （一）
    今春我新四军五师转移时，某分区警卫连有个战士生病，不能一同行军，李先念将军对他及其他留下的同志讲话时，号召共产党员：“要时刻记住在艰苦困难时，不论讨饭，或给人家当长工，都不要忘掉或侮辱共产党这个光荣的称号”。又说：“不久老大哥（八路军）便会来接你们。”
    这个战士的病好后，便给地主当长工，受到从未受过的苦楚，但他并不动摇灰心，心里老是盼望着“老大哥”快快来。这次解放军到商雒镇，他正在地里做活，一听到消息，连饭也没顾得吃，便一气跑到镇上，一见解放军，便热泪盈眶的说：
    “我们师长讲的对，老大哥果然来接我们了。”
    （二）
    和外间完全隔绝的陕南人民，从内战到抗日战争，到李先念将军所部转移，人民军队在陕南曾八进八出，当地人民曾受过反动派八次大屠杀，但人民坚信着“老大哥一定要来的”，这句话有力的鼓舞了陕南人民的斗争情绪。陈谢大军南渡的消息，他们从蒋匪西安报纸的警呼狂叫中知道的，散布在陕南五十几支游击队，百倍兴奋的活跃起来，一时陕南各地，传遍了解放大军已经到达的消息，许多驻有蒋匪军的据点，都出现了“陕南人民解放军”的标语。蒋匪爪牙乡保长们一日数惊，到处找不到“安全”地方逃躲，其实那时解放军还在五百里以外的陇海路上。
    当解放军沿着卢氏通雒南的大道前进时，王立同志派出十几组游击队员，到各大路口等候解放军，在敌人“清剿”中坚持下来的某民主县长，也走了一百八十里来迎接大军。有些游击队员，带来的简单信说：“八路军同志们，你们要攻打商州时，到某村找某人接头，他们可以带路。解放军某指挥员非常珍视这些游击队员，把他们称作‘活地图’。
    中秋节那天，王立同志率领的游击队在商雒镇和主力会师了，解放军坐着在龙驹寨附近缴获来的汽车，正逢集日，到处都挤满了狂欢的群众，该镇有三个五十多岁的农民，带着瓜果去看王立同志，他们说：“你们可见了太阳了，商雒镇也见了太阳了。”王立同志看到我军雄壮的队列，一尊尊的大炮，以及群众的狂欢，想起在艰苦奋斗中为人民解放事业而牺牲了的同志，百感交集，也兴奋得流出了眼泪。
    丹江沿岸的老百姓，用尽一切办法帮助解放军，某次我军由商南东开，正下着暴雨，河水涨得齐胸。××村有个二十多岁的妇女，冒着大雨，来回趟了十来次喘急的河水，帮助运东西，扶持体弱的战士们过河，解放军见她衣服破烂，给她一斗麦子，她一再推辞不肯接受，并说：“我是这里的妇会主任，自从你们走后，咱们可受够苦痛了，好容易队伍回来了，帮点忙算得什么。”说着她也不禁流出兴奋的热泪。
