[This report from our newspaper, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 24th] The Yellow River Tranquility Conference, of great historical significance here, opened on the 22nd in a certain place along the Yellow River. More than 300 representatives and model heroes from various special districts and counties rushed from hundreds of miles away as early as the 17th and 18th. The Hebei heroes who helped repair the Jin堤 [d堤, likely means dyke] in the summer also came from afar. Every corner of the conference site was filled with a festive atmosphere of victory. The people's heroes all showed joy after their victory in the arduous struggle against the Yellow River and Chiang's bandits. The venue of the Tranquility Conference was decorated solemnly and grandly. The Tranquility Arch, Heroes Arch, and the magnificent memorial tablet for the martyrs who died in the fight against the Yellow River at the venue were inscribed with the immortal historical traces of the heroes' struggle against the Yellow River and Chiang's bandits. The walls of the venue were covered with pictures and slogans depicting the construction of embankments, flood fighting, and the democratic government's relief to residents of the riverbed. More than a hundred congratulatory banners at the venue shone brightly and reflected each other in the early winter sun. The congratulatory message from the Border Region Government was: "Pool our wisdom and efforts to defeat the flood monsters and win a piece of clean land!" The congratulatory message from Taiyue read: "Defeated Chiang Kai-shek's '400,000 troops' and saved the millions of people of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan." The congratulatory message from the Taihang District Party Committee was: "The deeds of the iron-willed people's heroes." At 12 o'clock, more than 300 heroes marched into the venue in a booming sound of salute cannons, lively trumpets, and thunderous applause. There was a burst of tense and joyful commotion in the venue, and the conference opened. Deputy Director Zhang of the Yellow River Committee addressed the audience in applause, saying: "The US-Chiang's Yellow River conspiracy has been shattered by the people of our liberated areas. The Yellow River's proneness to breaches in history no longer exists in our liberated areas." Deputy Director Han Zhe of the Administrative Office read the congratulatory telegram from Chairman Yang and Rong of the Border Government and called on the heroes to work harder after the meeting, without arrogance or complacency, to do a better job on the Yellow River and strive for the final elimination of the Chiang bandits and defeat of the Yellow River. Long Fengying, the female hero of Kunwu who repaired the embankment, took the stage to speak, calling on the heroes to follow the instructions of Director Han and strive to fight and defeat Chiang Kai-shek. In the evening, songs rose up, gongs and drums shook the sky, and the lively recreational program began.

[Special report from our newspaper] Chiang's bandit opened the river on March 15, flooding the lives and property of the people along the Yellow River in our liberated areas, and attempting to use this to save his military crisis. The residents along the coast rose up to build embankments for self-rescue, and were bombed by Chiang's bandits' planes, determined to put our millions of people along the river to death. Chiang's bandits' brutal crimes have long aroused the anger of the people of our entire liberated area and the people of the whole country. Six million people in the Western Manchuria Liberated Area, in order to support our millions of compatriots along the Yellow River, recently sent a letter to the Border Region Government and the Shandong Provincial Government to be forwarded to the disaster-stricken compatriots along the Yellow River, vowing to jointly eliminate the tyrannical rule of the Chiang bandits, and donated funds converted into 35 taels, 1 qian, and 4 fen of gold, which have now been distributed to our region and Shandong as funds for repairing the Yellow River and disaster relief.
