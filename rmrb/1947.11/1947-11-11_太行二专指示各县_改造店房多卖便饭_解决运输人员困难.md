(Report from our newspaper in Taihang) To vigorously carry out winter production and transportation and solve the living difficulties of transportation personnel, the Second Special District Commissioner's Office, based on the demands of the masses, instructed all counties to renovate shops. Firstly, it stated: The profit-making of restaurants and shops on major transportation routes is too high. All guests staying at the shops must eat cooked noodles, costing 450 yuan per catty. If they do not eat noodles, they must pay 100 yuan for the room, and are also treated coldly by the shop owners. The masses have the reflection that "whatever is earned is taken by the shops." Renovating shops has become an urgent demand of the masses. Subsequently, four suggestions for improvement were put forward: 1. The renovation of existing shops and restaurants cannot rely on a single order; it is necessary to get through the thinking of the shop owners. Explain that winter transportation is for surviving the famine and digging up the roots of Chiang [Kai-shek]. Farmers all over the world are one family. Small profits and large sales will make money. Sell more cheap and filling foods such as sweet potatoes, cornmeal, and millet porridge. All localities should regard this work as one of the conditions for responding to the great production and making contributions to surviving the famine. 2. County, district, and village cooperatives that have already set up shops and restaurants should inspect and renovate them. If they have not been established on major transportation routes, they should allocate certain funds and personnel to specifically open disaster relief transportation reception stations or other facilities to facilitate the food and lodging of transportation personnel and livestock, making it a direct operation of the cooperative. Under the principle of not losing money, provide as much convenience as possible to transportation personnel. 3. On transportation routes with heavy traffic but no shops, old, weak, or poor people lacking capital should be supported in a planned manner to open shops for production. 4. Mobilize the masses to take more care of the disaster victims being transported. Relying solely on one or two shops cannot meet the needs of the masses for organized and grouped supplies in winter. We should strengthen the education of the masses on transportation routes to achieve fair trade, free borrowing of items from homes, and warm hospitality. When necessary, local guest houses should be combined with shops to better solve the difficulties of food and lodging for the masses during transportation.

　　太行二专指示各县
  　改造店房多卖便饭
    解决运输人员困难
    【本报太行讯】为大力开展今冬生产运输，解决运输人员生活困难，二专署根据群众要求，指示各县改造店房。首称：各交通大路的饭铺、店房营利过大，对住店客人，均须吃熟面，每斤四百五十元。不吃面，须出房钱一百元，同时还受店主冷淡对待。群众有“赚上些也被店房得了”的反映，改造店房，已成为群众的迫切要求。继提出四点改进意见：一、改造现有店房、饭铺不能靠一纸命令，须打通店主人的思想。说明冬季运输是为了渡荒，打蒋刨老根，天下农民是一家，利轻人多会赚钱，多卖省钱而又能够吃饱的山药蛋、玉茭面、小米饭等，各地应把这一工作，做为响应大生产渡荒立功条件之一。二、县区村合作社已设有店房饭铺者，应检查改造；如交通大道没设立者，应抽一定的资金、人员，专门开设灾民运输招待站或其他，便利运输人畜的食宿，成为合作社直接经营的一部分，在不赔本的原则下，尽量给运输人员以方便。三、在交通路上，来往人多，而没有店房者，应有计划的扶植老弱，或缺乏资本的贫苦人，开设店房生产。四、发动群众对运输灾民多加照顾，单依靠一两家店房，不能适应群众冬季有组织的、成组成队的供给要求。应加强交通线上的群众教育，做到照顾公平买卖，住家借东西不出钱，热情招待，必要时各地招待所要和店房相结合，更好的解决群众运输中食宿困难。（二专通讯组）
