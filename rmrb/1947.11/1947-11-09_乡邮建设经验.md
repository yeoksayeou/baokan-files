The Sixth Branch Bureau of the Postal District Bureau, in its five months of rural postal construction, has gained the following experiences: (1) Organizing a primary school communication network, first promoted through administrative means. The Commissioner's Office issued an order, with the education departments of each county and the cultural and educational assistants of each district cooperating with the post office to universally organize primary school communication networks. After newspapers are delivered to the primary schools, students carry them back to their villages when school is dismissed. (2) Establishing new agency points to ensure timely delivery of newspapers to rural areas. Exchange offices are set up in each market town as agency points, with the Commissioner's Office issuing an order for the industry and commerce bureaus of each county to cooperate in establishing them. The organization is managed by a trader with a higher level of education who is specifically responsible for the agency point work. Their treatment is the same as other traders, and they are exempted from wartime service tasks. (3) Because agency points transfer newspapers to too many villages, they still cannot deliver newspapers to readers in a timely manner. To supplement this deficiency, rural distribution points are established. Based on the actual distribution of villages, a central point is designated for every ten to fifteen villages, and one or two people from each village are found to connect with the central point. A official document bag is made, and when picking up newspapers from the central point each day, they can send worker-peasant communication drafts. The village liaison receives compensation by having their rear service labor levies reduced (but not frontline support duties). (4) Implementing loudspeaker broadcasts, starting first in districts of each county where mass mobilization is relatively good.

    乡邮建设经验
    【本报冀鲁豫五日电】邮政区局六分局，在五个月的乡邮建设中，得出经验（一）组织小学通讯网，首先用行政推动，专署下令，由各县教育科、区文教助理员配合邮局普遍组织小学通讯网，报纸送到小学后，在放学时各村小学生携带回村。（二）建立新代办所，使报纸及时转递入农村，在每个集镇布置交易所为代办所，由专署下令各县工商局配合建立。其组织由一位文化水平较高的交易员专负责代办所工作，待遇与其他交易员相同，并免除战勤任务。（三）因为代办所转村庄太多，仍不能及时转送报纸到读者手里，为补充其不足，设乡村发行点根据村庄分布的实际情形，划分中心点十至十五个村，每村找一人至二人与中心点联络，并制一公文袋，每天去中心点取报纸时，可送工农通讯稿件，村联络待遇，减去后勤劳役支差，（不免前方支差）。（四）实行喇叭广播，首先在每县找个发动群众比较好的区来进行。
