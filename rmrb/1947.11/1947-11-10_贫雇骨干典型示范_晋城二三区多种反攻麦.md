    Poor and Hired Peasant Cadres Set an Example
    Jincheng's Second and Third Districts Expand Planting of "Counter-Attack Wheat"
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 7th] Jincheng's Second and Third Districts' plan to expand planting of "Counter-Attack Wheat" was completed before October 25th. The Second District planted 80,000 mu, and the Third District planted 87,655 mu, accounting for 60 percent of all land. The wheat seedlings have now all emerged. Among them, the "169" wheat, which was trial-planted in Nanyicheng, is growing the best. Si Zhen and said: "169 is good. The seedlings are growing strong and sturdy, and the leaves are wide, thick, and green. Just by looking at the seedlings, you know that the harvest will be bigger than our local wheat." According to the summaries from the two districts, there are two points of experience in organizing this wheat planting: First, cadres take the lead. Most of these cadres are from poor and hired peasant backgrounds and can bring their own supplies, go deep into the mutual aid teams to labor and lead, thus mobilizing all the labor force. In the Second District alone, the number of mutual aid teams increased to 970. Even merchants from Bagong, Gaodu, and Dayang were mobilized. In particular, women's labor was mobilized. In the Third District alone, 20,000 women were active on the production front. Therefore, despite the continuous autumn rains, the plan to expand planting of "Counter-Attack Wheat" was not affected. Second, typical examples promoted wheat planting. In particular, the Second District introduced the example of the Yu Neng mutual aid team, which was based on poor and hired peasants. The Yu Neng Sanhe mutual aid team took the lead with hired and poor peasants as the backbone, and controlled the landlords, so the mutual aid team only expanded and did not disperse. Sun Qunsuo said: Poor and hired peasants have many skills and can think of good methods. Therefore, everyone was deeply impressed. After returning to their villages, they learned the Sanhe mutual aid method and adopted the large mutual aid method, with everyone planting everyone's land.
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 7th] Yangcheng's Xianyi, Yanli, Nanren, Chongshang, and other villages, led by poor and hired peasants, continued to increase the planting of "Counter-Attack Wheat" by 700 mu. Since the district discussed the great significance of autumn plowing and wheat planting this year on November 18th, the villages had originally finished planting wheat, but later they continued to increase planting, especially in the villages led by poor and hired peasants, which were even more enthusiastic. The Xianyi village mutual aid brigade guaranteed to plant another 300 mu of "Counter-Attack Wheat". Military dependent Yang Sanfeng saw that the team was planting wheat again, and she said: "No, I will plant another mu!" She immediately went to the field to pull up stubble and pick up stones, and launched mutual aid and mutual borrowing, lending out a dan of wheat to solve the difficulty of poor and hired peasants lacking wheat seeds. On the 30th of last month, Nanren Village held a meeting and guaranteed that each family would plant one more mu. Within three days, they mobilized 436 men and women and 77 cattle, and they started working together and completely planted 221 mu of wheat in the whole village. Now they are rushing to plow in the autumn.

    贫雇骨干典型示范
    晋城二三区多种反攻麦
    【本报太岳七日电】晋城二、三两区多种反攻麦计划已于十月二十五日前完成。二区种麦八万亩，三区种麦八万七千六百五十五亩，占全部土地的百分之六十，现麦苗已全部出土，其中以南义城试种的“一六九”小麦出得最好，苗已长一寸多高，司真和说：“一六九就是好，苗长的肥实，叶子又宽又厚又绿，光看苗就知道比咱本地麦子收成大”。据两区总结，组织此次种麦有两点经验：一、干部带头，这批干部大部分是贫雇出身的能自带给养，深入互助组劳动与领导，因此发动起全部劳力来，仅二区互助组即增至九百七十个，连巴公、高都、大阳等商人亦发动起来。尤其发动了妇女劳动，仅三区即有两万妇女活跃在生产战线上，所以虽在秋雨连绵的情况下，也没影响了多种反攻麦的计划。二、以典型示范推动了种麦，尤其二区介绍了以贫雇为骨干的庾能互助组典型。庾能三合互助组即以雇贫为骨干带头，管制了地主，所以互助组只有扩大没有散。孙群锁说：贫雇本事多哩，能想出好办法来，因此给大家印象深刻，各村回去后，学习三合互助办法，采用了大互助办法，大家地大家种。
    【本报太岳七日电】阳城献义、演礼、南任、崇上等村贫雇带头继续增种“反攻麦”七百亩，自十一月十八日区上讨论了今年秋垡种麦的重大意义后，各村原来已种完麦了，后来继续增种麦，尤其以贫雇带头的村子劲头更大。献义村互助大队保证再种反攻麦三百亩，军属杨三凤看见组内又种麦，她说：“不行，我也再种一亩！”马上就去地里拔茬拾石头，又展开互助互剂，借出一石麦子解决了贫雇没麦籽的困难。南任庄于上月三十日开会保证一家多种一亩，已在三天内动员起全村男女四百卅六人，七十七犋牲口，一齐动手，就把全村二百二十一亩麦完全种起了，现正赶秋垡。
