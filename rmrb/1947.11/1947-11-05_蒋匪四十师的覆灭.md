Xinhua News Agency, Hubei-Henan-Anhui Front, 2nd: Chiang Kai-shek's 40th Division, which had suffered a devastating blow from General Liu Bocheng on the Pinghan Railway line, was forced to leave Anyang City and was airlifted to the Longhai Railway line during the great victory of the People's Liberation Army in annihilating nine and a half brigades of Chiang Kai-shek's forces in southwestern Shandong. Soon after, our army advanced to the Dabie Mountain area, and it was driven to follow the People's Liberation Army to the Dabie Mountains. Later, when our army attacked Macheng, Huang'an, and Songbu, it followed us south. When our army returned north to the Shangcheng area and annihilated a regiment and a battalion of the 58th Division, it followed the 7th Division north again. When we went south again to occupy Huang'an and Songbu, and even fought as far as Tuanfeng on the banks of the Yangtze River, it hurriedly followed for hundreds of miles to Tuanfeng. After finding nothing in Tuanfeng, the enemy, unaware that it was facing annihilation, still advanced eastward arrogantly, finally finding its grave. At this time, a part of our main force had set out in two directions to ambush between Qishui and Guangji, and everything was ready, waiting for the enemy to come and throw themselves into the net. The enemy swaggered forward through Xishui towards Guangji, encountering little resistance. On the evening of the 26th, when Chiang Kai-shek's troops reached the Qingshui River and Gaoshanpu area, fighting unexpectedly broke out from the south. At first, they were not flustered and planned to deploy their troops according to the principles of an encounter battle in the combat regulations. Later, they discovered that the high ground on all sides, east, north, south, and even behind them, was in the hands of our army, and they could not help but panic. Our army's machine guns and artillery on the surrounding hilltops opened fire all at once, especially the two high mountains of Maqi Mountain and Lijiazhai on both sides of the highway to the north, which were occupied by our army, overlooking and suppressing all the enemies at the foot of the mountain. After a misty rainy night of confrontation, at 9:00 a.m. the next day (the 27th), we launched a general attack on all fronts. Our army's guns and artillery hardly stopped for a minute within two hours, and the entire valley was shaken by the artillery fire. The enemy immediately lost its command center, and the 82nd Brigade, which was under the command of the 40th Division, was left unattended. The enemy in Lijiazhai counterattacked repeatedly, trying to seize the hilltop and break through a bloody path to escape, but as a result, more than a thousand were killed or wounded on that hillside. From then on, the enemy completely lost its combat effectiveness and swarmed around the foot of the mountain like a nest of bees. Our army captured prisoners like herding ducks in a pond. Three soldiers from a certain unit confiscated the guns of a whole battalion of people, and a cook who delivered meals also brought back twenty or so prisoners. A telephone operator captured seven or eight, and the enemy's wounded soldiers automatically walked north along the highway to find the People's Liberation Army's hospital. At noon, the scattered gunfire on the entire front had stopped, but four American-style bombers and fighter planes came. The soldiers became active again, and everyone picked up the enemy's abandoned bullets and fired into the sky. Suddenly, one of the planes dropped something, and someone shouted, "Parachute!" Before he finished speaking, the plane's tail emitted thick smoke and tilted like a drunkard a few times, quickly falling on the Changqingsonglin mountain ridge, becoming a sacrificial object for the 40th Division and the 82nd Brigade.

    蒋匪四十师的覆灭
    唐平铸
    【新华社鄂豫皖前线二日电】曾经在平汉线上遭受刘伯承将军歼灭性打击的蒋匪第四十师，当解放军在鲁西南歼灭蒋匪九个半旅的大胜利中，被迫离开了安阳城，空运至陇海线上。不久，我军跃进至大别山区，它又被驱策，一路跟随人民解放军到大别山来。此后，我军打到麻城、黄安、宋埠时，它跟着南下，我军北返商城一带，消灭五十八师一个团和一个营时，它又和七师跟着北上，等我们再南下占领黄安宋埠，一直打到长江边上的团风时，它又带着八十二旅急急忙忙跟了几百里赶到了团风，在团风扑空之后，不知已面临覆灭的敌人，仍然狂妄东进，终于找到了它的坟墓。这时我主力一部已两路出动设伏于蕲水、广济之间，一切都准备妥当了，但等敌人前来自投罗网。敌人大摇大摆的经浠水向广济冒进，没有遇到什么抵抗，廿六日黄昏，蒋匪军到达清水河、高山铺一带时，南面出乎意外的发生了战斗，开始他们还不慌不忙打算按战斗条例上的遭遇战斗原则，把部队布置一下，后来发现东面北面南面以及他们的庇股后面，四周围的高地都在我军手中，于是不能不惊慌起来了。四面山头上我军的机枪大炮一齐开火，特别是北面公路两侧的马骑山与李家寨两座高山为我占领，居高临下，把敌人全部压在山底下。这样相持了一个细雨迷蒙的晚上，到第二天（二十七日）上午九时，我全线发动总攻，我军的枪炮，两小时内几乎没有停止过一分钟，整个山谷被炮火震动得摇撼起来。敌人当即失去指挥重心，受四十师指挥的八十二旅，也无人管了。在李家寨的敌人，往来反扑了多次，企图扼住山头冲出一条血路突围，但结果在那山坡上就死伤了一千多。从此敌人完全失去战斗力，一窝蜂的在山底下乱转。我军就象在池塘里赶鸭子一样大家动手捉俘虏，某部三个战士缴了一个营人的枪，一个送饭的伙夫也带回二十几个俘虏，查线的电话员捉了七八个，敌人的伤员也自动的沿公路向北走去找解放军的医院。正午十二时，全线稀落的枪声已停止，却来了四架美式的轰炸机与驱逐机，战士们又活跃起来，大家拿起敌人遗弃的子弹迎空射击，突然有一架飞机投掷下一件什么东西，有人喊：“降落伞”，话未完这架飞机庇股冒着浓烟象醉汉一样歪了几下，急速的落在长清松林的山岗上，做了四十师与八十二旅的殉葬物。
