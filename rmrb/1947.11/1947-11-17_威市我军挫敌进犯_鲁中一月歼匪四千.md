　　Xinhua News Agency, East China, 15th: Chiang Kai-shek bandits besieged in the Mianhua Mountain area of Weihaiwei, launched a surprise raid on Dongmatou, northeast of Weihai, to loot grain on the evening of the 2nd. They were fiercely repelled by our defending troops and fled back in disarray. On the morning of the 6th, more than a hundred Chiang Kai-shek bandits looted villages such as Sunjiatuan and Jingzi (more than ten miles north of Weihai), but were routed by our army, with seven enemies, including the commanding officer, killed.

　　Xinhua News Agency, East China, 14th: The Central Shandong Military Region has recently announced the battle achievements of the local corps in October: A total of 160 battles were fought, eliminating 3,708 enemies and local bandits, including more than 1,700 captured alive. Seventeen important strongholds, including Linqu City, were attacked and forced to retreat. The spoils included five 60mm mortars, eight grenade launchers, one hand cannon, thirty-two various machine guns, ten submachine guns, more than six hundred rifles and carbines, more than 50,000 rounds of ammunition, more than fifty shells, and some other supplies.

　　Xinhua News Agency, East China, 15th: Delayed news: A certain unit of the local armed forces of the First Sub-district of Central Jiangsu attacked the important locations of Rugao and Huangqiao held by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. On the night of the 28th of last month, a certain unit suddenly arrived in the suburbs of Rugao, cutting off the Rugao-Hai'an and Rugao-Xinshenggang highways. Then, with the force of lightning, they stormed the Chiang Kai-shek bandit barracks on West Gate Street, killing six enemies and seizing one 82mm mortar. At the same time, another unit used crossfire from three directions to fiercely fire on the Chiang Kai-shek bandit county government clock tower and pillboxes in the city center for dozens of minutes before safely withdrawing. Three days before this battle, they also successively captured Liangduo Town on the Tongyu Line, the Dongtai-Hai'an section, and strongholds such as Poling on the south side of the Hai'an-Taizhou Line. At the same time, another unit of the people's armed forces once attacked the important town of Huangqiao, eliminating a total of more than 120 Chiang Kai-shek bandits.
