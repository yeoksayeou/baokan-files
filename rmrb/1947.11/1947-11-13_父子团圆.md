　　Father and Son Reunited
    Ben Fang
    Yan Deyuan was a soldier in Chiang Kai-shek's New Fifth Army. He was wounded in the Yuncheng battle and rescued by the People's Liberation Army to a field hospital. He often thought of weaving flower baskets with sorghum stalks while in bed. On the morning of October 1st, a civilian caregiver came in from outside. When he saw Yan Deyuan, he was stunned, staring at him in a daze, wanting to call out but not daring to. Seeing him weaving a basket in his hand, he suddenly remembered, "Didn't Xi'er love to play with that when he was little?" He looked again and again, and couldn't help but cry out, "Xi'er, you, you're still alive?!" Yan Deyuan was startled and looked up to see an old man with graying temples. After a long while, he used all his strength to hold the old man's hands and shouted, "Dad, you're still alive!" The two embraced and wept bitterly, leaving the other three wounded soldiers in the room confused. Listening carefully, they realized that they were father and son who had been separated for fourteen years, and they never imagined they would be reunited today. The old man said, "Ever since you went out to beg for food in the twenty-second year, before the Eighth Route Army came, the suffering I endured was ten times more bitter than bitter melon. Our blood was drained by the 'Three Detachments' (referring to Chiang Kai-shek's bandit guerrillas). There was a great drought in our Tangyi area in the thirty-first year. Not a drop of rain fell for several months, and the crops yielded nothing, not even a blade of grass. Even the leaves were eaten. The 'Three Detachments' still forced us to hand over grain and money. People ate so little they couldn't defecate, only blood, and if you scraped off the skin, your bones would fall apart! The starving people rotted on their kang, leaving the poor with no way to heaven and no door to hell, so they had to grit their teeth and sell their sons and daughters!" At this point, the old man's tears couldn't help but gush out. He continued, "Xi'er! Your younger siblings were sold by me!" "Where's Mom?" the son asked urgently. "Your mother was defecating blood and hadn't eaten grass roots for six days. She was too weak to speak, and then...she died the night your younger siblings were sold! I couldn't move. I looked from the east to the west but didn't see a single person. I had no way to dig a pit in your mother's bedding and bury her. At dusk, the head of the bao led the 'Three Detachments' to demand our lives again, cursing and yelling, 'Where are the few kilograms of grain you got from selling your children?' They beat me for a while and knocked me unconscious. When I woke up, the grain was gone!" Father and son wept bitterly again for a while. The son said, "I begged for food in Nanjing. In the twenty-seventh year, I was arrested and forced into the army because I went to the municipal government to get food but didn't receive any. I've been a soldier ever since. If it weren't for the Eighth Route Army saving me, you would never have seen your son again!" The old man wiped his tears and said, "Son! The Eighth Route Army came, and we turned over! The two mu of land that 'Zhao Wuchang' had seized has been returned to us, and we've even been given more than two mu. Who would have thought that the 'poor ghosts' would live in the tile-roofed house of the 'Zhao Taiye' of the village!" "Really?" the son didn't believe it. The old man said, "How could it be false?" Father and son smiled. The old man took out a package of Luxi currency from his bag and gave it to his son, saying, "Son! Now if you look west from our × Village, you won't see a single house for more than ten li. One or two hundred villages have been destroyed by the 'Three Detachments'! The blood feud of your mother, your younger siblings, your neighbors, must be avenged by you! Do a good job in your own army, become a hero, and I'll find you a good wife!" Father and son smiled again. In the evening, the wounded soldiers were eating meat, and the landlord brought a bowl of fish. The old man bought wine, and the father and son, separated for fourteen years, used the great moonlight to drink a cup of reunion wine.

　　父子团圆
    奔放
    阎德元原在蒋军新五军当兵，郓城作战中他负了伤，被解放军救到野战×院，他常想在病床上用秫秸皮编花篮。十月一日午前，外边进来一位民工看护员，一看到阎德元就呆住了，出神的瞧着他，想叫又没敢叫，见他手里编篮子，猛想起“喜儿从小不是爱玩它吗？”望了又望，忍不住叫了一声“喜儿，你，你还活着？！”阎德元吓得一跳，抬头看是位鬓发灰白的老汉，半晌使力拉着老汉的双手，大叫：“爹呀，你老人家也还存着！”两人抱头痛哭，弄得房里另屋三个伤员莫明其妙，细听方知是离别十四年的父子，万想不到今日团圆。老汉说：“自从你二十二年出去讨饭，八路没来之前，俺受的苦比黄连还苦十分。血被‘三支队’（指蒋匪游击队）喝完了，咱堂邑一带三十一年大旱，几个月没落一滴雨，庄稼寸草无收，连叶儿也吃光了，到后来找草根磨面吃。‘三支队’还迫着缴粮缴钱，人吃得屙不下来，尽屙血，身上去掉肉皮，骨头就要散了！饿死的人在炕上烂了，弄得穷汉上天无路入地无门，只好忍痛割肉卖儿卖女！”说到此处，老汉的泪水不由得夺眶而出。又说：“喜儿呀！你的弟妹被俺卖了！”“娘呢？”儿子紧接着问。“你娘屙血，六天没吃草根，饿的说不出话来，就……就在你弟妹卖走的夜里死了！俺不能动弹，东头望到西头，不见一个人，没法挖了一天在你娘铺下挖了个小坑把她埋了。黄昏，保长领着‘三支队’又来要命，破口就骂‘你卖孩子的几斤粮食呢？打了一会，把我打晕了，醒来不见粮食！”父子又痛哭一阵。儿子说：“俺讨饭到南京，二十七年因向市政府领粮，没领到粮反被抓去当兵，一直当到现在，要不是八路救我，你老人家休想见儿了！”老汉擦擦眼泪，又说：“儿呀！八路来了，俺翻身了，被‘赵无常’！剥去的二亩地还给咱了，还分给咱二亩多，想不到庄上‘赵太爷’的瓦屋给咱‘穷鬼’住了！”“真的吗？”儿子不相信，老汉说：“怎么会假呢？”父子笑开了，老汉从袋里取出一包鲁西币给儿子，说道：“儿呀！现在咱×庄向西看，十几里不见一户人家，一、二百庄子被‘三支队’毁了！你娘、你弟、你妹、你亲邻的冤仇要你报！在自家队伍里好好干吧，当个英雄，俺给你娶个好媳妇！”父子又笑开了。晚上，伤员正吃肉，房东送碗鱼来，老汉买酒，遥一别十四年的父子，借大好月光喝杯团圆酒。
