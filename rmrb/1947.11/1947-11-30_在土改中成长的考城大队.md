　　The Kao City Brigade Grows Up in Land Reform
    ·Yuan Yu·
    　　　　(1) From Not Believing in Land Reform to Participating Personally
    Soldier Wang Xicheng, nicknamed "Twelve Liang." This year, in the first month [of the lunar calendar], after hearing about the "reasons for turning over" and going through squad and platoon discussions, he understood the truth of "the rich rely on the poor." At the general meeting of all soldiers in the battalion, he recounted his suffering.
    ——In the past, his father farmed for the landlord in × Temple Shop, suffering all kinds of hardships, eating pig food, and working like an ox. But his mother was forcibly taken advantage of by the shopkeeper, which angered his father to death. He had to endure hunger and lead a vagrant life....
    After Wang Xicheng recounted his suffering, most comrades realized: "No matter which landlord, they must bully and exploit the poor to survive!" But some comrades were still saying, "It's fate!"
    When everyone saw the land reform news in the newspaper, they didn't believe that such a thing could really happen. Some said, "Even if it's true, it can't be implemented here." Coincidentally, Cai Hao, who had been hospitalized in Hebei, returned to the team. These comrades broadcast everywhere about the land reform situation they had witnessed in Hebei, and everyone made a half-turn.
    In March, the troops conducted an "anti-mopping up" operation in the Second District of Qibin. Seeing that people were carrying out land reform and distributing floating wealth, everyone had a better understanding of carrying out land reform during guerrilla warfare.
    After a truth is accepted by the masses, it will generate great power. The Tianji battle struck at the enemy's 429th Regiment's ferocity. The environment was temporarily stabilized, and everyone proposed, "If the Second District of Qibin can distribute land, so can the Fifth District of Kao City!" "Then why haven't we started yet?" At the general meeting of all soldiers, County Magistrate Ma said: "In the old society, no one looked up to those without land, and they couldn't even get a wife..." Then he announced the methods for controlling landlords during land reform. The support from the leadership greatly encouraged the soldiers' emotions. They asked, "Can the soldiers take revenge?!"
    Coincidentally, soldier Ma Faqun's family was fined by the enemy and came to the unit to borrow money. The brigade immediately seized three pseudo-affiliated families and demanded that they compensate three times the amount. The enemy finally succumbed in front of us. After not coming out for three days, they sent back all the things they had fined; we then fined them double the amount. The soldiers were even more energetic.
    The troops were stationed in Anle Village, Fourth District, where they were seizing floating wealth. Company Commander Wan Xingyu of the First Company arranged for soldiers to monitor the landlords hiding things; and told everyone not to take anything from the masses. A small messenger of the Second Company saw a landlady hiding a small square box in a chicken coop. He told the masses, and as a result, the masses found a lot of silverware. The landlord's family of the Second Squad was poor. The landlord hid two bundles in their house. The soldiers told them: "We are all poor people, we can't hide the landlord's things!" The landlord then put the bundles outside the door. After hearing the news of the land reform, the landlord Xie Wanhe told the person in charge of the brigade through a sergeant of the Third Company: "My things can be handed over to the higher authorities to buy guns (meaning the masses cannot divide them)." Later, after his floating wealth was divided, he asked Company Commander Wang to "suggest to the higher authorities": "Can you leave him a little more things?" But no one in the brigade paid any attention to him, and no one acted as the landlord's "air-raid shelter."
    　　　　(2) Strict Discipline
    The movement to help the masses was carried out vigorously, and backward elements also received due education.
    The groom Lao Li stayed at his aunt's house. The masses were seizing floating wealth. He used a big pot to boil a pot of boiling water and put it there without taking it out. When the masses moving the floating wealth asked, he said, "It's for the brigade headquarters!" The big pot was thus covered up. In the afternoon, he carried a large bundle of the landlord's out, but was stopped by the sentry and sent to the brigade headquarters. Later, everyone scolded him as a "running dog." Wang Shouxin took a huqin from the masses and was also punished.
    In order to prevent deviations in participating in land reform, the leadership specially stipulated:
    1. Squads and platoons collect public opinion from the masses, discover the ideological problems of soldiers' understanding of land reform, and correct them in time;
    2. It is not allowed to approach or talk to landlords;
    3. Use the masses' reflections to educate the troops;
    4. Do not take anything from the masses.
    　　　　(3) Consolidated the Troops
    If we simply compare the numbers of deserters (the number of deserters in the ten days before June 10 was more than the number of deserters in the three months from the end of June to September 10), to prove that the troops after land reform education were consolidated, that is still very insufficient. From the following fragments of stories, we can specifically see the mood of the masses after turning over:
    Some time ago, five soldiers of the Third Company requested relief for their families, but it was not resolved in time. These three left without saying goodbye. Three old cooks went home once after the land reform. He gratefully said to the instructor: "Instructor, you really saved me. A few days ago, if you hadn't patiently talked to me a few times, if I had really left, I wouldn't have been able to get land, and I would have been a deserter for the rest of my life, which would have been really shameful! Now that I have land, I must work hard to the end!"
    Ma Ji, a cook in the Third Company, whose family was poor peasant, was given preferential treatment as a military dependent in the land reform, and was newly added with more than 20 mu of land. Ma Ji's mother came and said to him: "Ji! With you, you wouldn't be able to buy twenty mu of land even if you were exhausted. Thanks to Chairman Mao's leadership. From now on, work hard! I'm waiting to get you a wife..." Ma Ji's face also showed a happy smile.
    Xie Zhi of the Third Company, whose family is from Xietan Village, was divided into thirteen mu of land for three people, and shared a cow and many clothes with others; but he still felt it was too little, so the whole class gave him a lot of opinions. Later, his mother came and pointed to the new clothes she had just put on and said: "Don't be dissatisfied? If the Communist Party wasn't here, we wouldn't be like this in our whole life."
    Before the implementation of land reform, military dependents often went hungry. When family members came, they either said: "There's nothing to eat at home, think of a way!" or cried out: "If we continue to work like this, the family won't be able to live! Go home quickly!" Requests to solve family problems and personal problems came! Now? The problems of eating, clothing, wife, and life have been solved, and in work and combat, they have all exerted their enthusiasm. A new situation has emerged in the troops.
    　　　　(4) Fighting for Ourselves
    "We are the people's army!" "Fight for the people!" In the past, the degree to which soldiers accepted it (class consciousness was confused) was not very clear; after land reform education, everyone understood "who to fight for!" "Why fight?" "How to do it," and improved combat effectiveness.
    Ma Suixuan of the Third Platoon of the First Company, after the Tianji battle, led a small unit to protect land reform in the Third District of Kao City. He said to his comrades: "We have divided the land! To defend the land, can we not beat the enemy?" Everyone understood the importance of protecting the land and protecting their lives, and always insisted on protecting the land reform, and won many battles. Originally, Ma Suixuan's father lived by growing and selling vegetables. Ma Suixuan served in the security brigade for a few years and suffered a lot of foreign crimes, but he didn't achieve anything. After joining the Eighth Route Army, he worked very diligently. Now he is even happier to say to others: "We have divided the land, so we must work hard!" Ma Suixuan also changed his understanding of combat. "In the past, fighting was for guns, but now I know that fighting is also for protecting the land."
    Seeing the scene of his family after land reform, Ma Xinglai made a reflection to the instructor: "I know now! Why I am doing this. In the past, the instructor said: 'Do it for yourself,' I couldn't understand it, I thought it was for the cadres. Now I believe the instructor's words!"
    In the past, violations of discipline were very serious. After land reform, troop discipline was easier to grasp. In the Shao Gang battle, all the captured items were handed over to the public, and no one complained.
    After land reform, everyone's awareness has been improved, and their work has become more active, which has made them deeply love the hope for the future and the existing interests—protecting the land and protecting their lives.

### 在土改中成长的考城大队

　　在土改中成长的考城大队
    ·袁毓·
    　　　　（一）从不相信土改到亲自参加
    战士王喜成，外号“十二两”。今年正月，他听过了“翻身道理”，又经过了班排讨论，他弄清了：“富靠穷”的真理，在全营军人大会上诉了苦。
    ——以前他父亲在×庙店给地主种地，受了千辛万苦，吃猪食，出牛力，但母亲硬叫掌柜的强占了，因此，把父亲气死了，他只得忍饥挨饿过流浪生活……。
    经过王喜成诉苦，大多数同志都认识到：“无论那个地主，都是要欺侮、剥削穷人才能生活！”但个别同志还在说：“命该如此！”
    当大家看到报上登的土改消息，都不相信会真有这样的事，有的说：“就算是真的，咱这里也实行不了。”恰巧，在河北住院的彩号归队了，这些同志把河北亲眼见到的土改情形，到处广播，大家才转了半个弯子。
    三月间，部队反“扫荡”插到了齐滨二区，看见人家正进行土改，分浮财的情形，使大家对游击战争中实行土改，有了更进一步的认识。
    一个真理被群众接受之后，它会产生伟大的力量。田集战斗打击了敌人四二九团的凶焰，环境暂时稳定了，大家就提出：“人家齐滨二区能分地，咱考城五区也能分！”“那为啥还不下手呢？”全体军人会上，马县长说：“在旧社会里，没地的人谁也看不起，连个老婆也娶不上……”接着他宣布了土改中控制地主的办法，领导上的撑腰，大大鼓舞了战士们的情绪，他们提出：“战士能报仇吗？！”
    恰巧，战士马法群家里被敌人罚了款，来部队里借钱，大队便马上抓住伪属三家，要他们赔偿三倍。敌人在我们面前终于屈服了，三天没出来，把罚去的东西，全部给送回来；咱又罚了他一倍。战士们劲更大了。
    部队驻在四区安乐村，这里正搞浮财，一连长万兴玉布置了战士监视地主藏东西；并告诉大家，不准拿群众的一点东西。二连小通讯员，看到地主家娘们藏到鸡窝里一个小方匣，他便告诉了群众，结果群众搜出好多银器。二班房东家是穷人，地主藏他家两个包袱，战士们告诉她：“咱们都是穷人，可不能藏地主的东西呀！”房东便把包袱放到门外去。地主解万和听到土改消息后，他通过三连上士向大队负责人说：“我的东西可交上级买枪（意思是群众不能分），后来分了他的浮财，他又找王连长‘向上级提’：‘能不能给他多留一点东西？’但大队谁也没有理他，都不当地主的‘防空洞’。
    　　　　（二）严格纪律
    帮助群众的运动，轰轰烈烈的搞起来了，落后分子也受到了应有的教育。
    马夫老李，住到他姑家，群众正搞浮财，他便用一口大锅，烧一锅开水，放在那里不往外起。搬浮财的群众一问，他便说：“给大队部烧的！”大锅就这样被掩护下了。下午，他又把地主一个大包袱往外扛，被哨兵查住了，送了大队部。后来大家都骂他是“狗腿”。王守信拿了群众一个胡琴，也受到了处分。
    领导上为防止参加土改中的偏向特规定：
    一、班排搜集群众舆论，发掘战士中对实行土改认识的思想毛病，及时纠正；
    二、不准和地主接近谈话；
    三、用群众反映，对部队进行教育；
    四、不拿群众东西。
    　　　　（三）巩固了部队
    假如单纯拿逃亡的数字对比（六月十号以前十天的逃亡数字比六月底到九月十号三个月中逃亡的还要多），来证明经过土改教育的部队巩固，那还是非常不够的，从下边的几个片断的故事中，可以具体的看到群众翻身后的心情：
    前些日子，三连五个战士要求对家庭的救济，未及时解决，这三个便不辞而别了。三个老伙夫，在土改后回家一次，他感激的对指导员说：“指导员，你真救了我，前几天，你要不跟我耐心的谈几回，我要是真走了，地也分不上，一辈子落个逃兵，真丢人呀！现在俺有了土地，我非干到底不中！”
    三连伙夫马计，家系贫农，土改中按军属优待，新添的二十多亩地。马计他娘来了，对他说：“计！凭你那样，累死你也置不了二十亩地，亏了毛主席领导，从今后好好的干吧！等着给你娶个媳妇……。”马计脸上，也露出喜悦的笑容。
    三连解治，家是谢滩村的，三口人分了十三亩地、和别人伙分了一头牛、好多衣服；但他还觉得太少，全班因此给他提了不少意见。后来他娘来了，指着自己刚穿上的新衣服说：“别不知足啦？要不是共产党在这里，咱一辈子也不能这样。”
    在没有实行土改以前，常有军属挨饿的，家属来了，不是说：“家里没啥吃了，想个办法吧！”就是哭喊着：“再干下去，家里就没法活啦！赶快回家吧！”要求解决家庭问题，闹个人问题的都来啦！现在呢？吃饭、穿衣、老婆、生活问题解决了，在工作中，战斗中，都发挥了他们的积极性。部队出现了一个新局面。
    　　　　（四）打仗是为了自己
    “我们是人民的军队！”“为人民而战！”过去，在战士们接受的程度上（阶级觉悟糊涂），是不十分明确；经过土改教育，大家弄清了“为谁打仗！”“为啥打仗”、“怎着干”，提高了战斗力。
    一连三排马遂轩，当田集战斗后，他领着小部队在考城三区掩护土改，他对同志们说：“咱分了地啦！来保卫土地，打不过敌人能中吗？”大家都体会了保田、保命的重要意义，始终坚持掩护土改，打了许多胜仗。原来马遂轩他爹种菜卖菜过日子，马遂轩当过几年保安旅，受了不少的洋罪，啥也没弄成，参加八路军后，他很安心工作，现在他更高兴的对别人说：“分了地了要好好的干！”马遂轩也改变了他对作战的认识“过去打仗为了得枪，现在才知道打仗也是为了保田。”
    马兴来看到家里土改后的光景，向指导员作了反省：“我是知道啦！自己是为啥干。以前指导员说：‘为自己干，’我打不通，觉得是为干部干的。这会我才相信指导员的话！”
    过去违犯纪律的现象很严重，经过土改，部队纪律好掌握了，邵岗战斗，缴获完全交了公，没有说怪话的。
    经过土改，大家的觉悟提高了，工作积极了，使他们对将来的希望和现有的利益发生了深切的爱——保田保命。
