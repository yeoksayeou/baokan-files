　　[This newspaper's] Jiexiu dispatch: On October 25th, the enemy's 73rd Division, 218th Regiment, a battalion-sized force, coordinated with the "Struggle Corps" to seize grain, launching an attack on Shangliang Village, First District, Jiexiu. Zhang Ximan's Emancipation Team used the "Return Thunder" for the second time. After burying the mines in the village in advance, they maneuvered and withdrew from the village. The enemy then rushed into the village without any resistance, and then divided their forces to plunder on a large scale. As soon as they entered Hong's house, a mine was triggered, killing one enemy soldier. At the gate of the hero Zhang Ximan's house, a "Good Luck at the Door" hanging mine killed two enemies. Another group of enemies, at the house of the fleeing landlord Bao Hongyuan, stepped into the militia's minefield, resulting in two fellows having their brains burst. Another enemy was killed in Wang Fengying's courtyard. After killing six enemies in a row, the enemies were in a panic, frightened and intimidated, thinking that "mines were everywhere," and they dared not enter any more courtyards. In this way, nine out of ten ordinary people did not suffer major losses.

　　At the same time, the Zhang Ximan combat team ambushing outside the village, along with the militia from the Pan Yu, Shangliang, Goukou, and Goudi bee-like joint defense zone, quickly organized firepower upon hearing the "rumbling" sound, and suddenly returned to the village to attack the enemy. Liu Shuhua's machine gun was accurate, killing two enemies. The enemy was unable to withstand the attack and fled in droves in the direction of Xia Li Hou. The militiamen, in high spirits, took advantage of the victory to pursue the enemy to Jianli Village. Just as the puppet "Village Authority" was seizing grain, they were attacked again, injuring two enemies, and seizing ten shi of grain, three sheep, and a large cart of clothing and cotton. In this battle, we suffered no casualties, and killed or wounded ten enemies.

    Note: The enemy had established a stronghold in Xia Liang Village by October 21st, but because the militia in the joint defense zone combined guns and mines, they were hit hard. Within four days (October 21st-25th), mines killed or wounded twelve enemies, and another eighteen were hit by "bullets." As a result, they had no choice but to withdraw on October 25th. (Jiali)

　　Pingyao militia blasting team injured seven Yan bandits with five thunderbolts in the anti-"mopping-up" battle. On the 23rd of last month, the Yan bandits launched a "mopping-up" operation to seize grain from our First District. The Second Blasting Squadron immediately launched an anti-"mopping-up" operation, sending out intelligence to various villages and actively deploying minefields. They buried five landmines at the Sancha key intersection and the Xiaoma Ao embankment, and the entire team ambushed on the mountain, preparing to strike the enemy hard. On the 24th, the Yan bandits' 44th Division, 2nd Regiment, concentrated more than 1,000 people from the "Struggle Corps," "Homecoming Corps," and puppet "Village Public Office" and invaded Qianzhuang, Sanchakou, and other places. In the middle of the night, the Yan bandits entered our minefield and stepped on all five landmines in a row, wounding seven Yan bandits and abandoning three rifles. Among them was Quan Bao'er, the local most hated counter-settlement boss. At this time, the Yan bandits dared not move forward, and continued to advance until dawn, but the nearby masses had already transferred after hearing the thunder, and suffered no losses. Therefore, the local masses began to sing, "Iron thunder is made of pig iron, it can put us on sentry duty."

　　张锡满翻身队保粮立功
  　使用“回马雷”痛歼阎匪
    【本报介休讯】十月二十五日，洪山敌七三师、二一八团一个营兵力，配合“奋斗团”抢粮，向我介休一区上梁村进攻，张锡满翻身队二次使用“回马雷”，预先在村中将雷埋好后，机动从村中撤出，当时敌人便毫无阻挡窜入村中，一时分兵大肆抢劫，刚进洪×家，触雷炸死敌一名，英雄张锡满家大门，一颗“开门大吉”吊雷炸死敌人两个，另一股敌人，在逃亡地主宝鸿元家，踏进了民兵雷阵，结果两个家伙脑浆迸流。王凤英家院又炸死敌一名。这样一连炸死敌人六名后，一时敌手忙脚乱，胆战心惊，认为“遍地都有雷”，不敢再进一家院子，这样十分之九老百姓没有遭受重大损失。
    这边村外埋伏的张锡满战斗队，与板峪、上梁、沟口、沟底等密蜂联防区民兵们，耳闻“轰隆”声，即迅速组织火力，回马突回村中，向敌攻击；刘树华机枪打的准，击毙敌二名，敌不支，便纷纷向下李后方向溃退。众民兵抖擞精神，乘胜追至涧里村，正当伪“乡村”抢粮，又被我打伤两名，并夺下粮食十石，羊三只，衣物、棉花一大车。是役我毫无伤亡，炸死、毙伤敌十名。
    按：敌人至十月二十一日，在下梁村扎下钉子，但因该联防区民兵枪雷结合，打的吃紧，四天内（二十一——二十五）地雷炸死、炸伤敌十二名，中了“枪子”的又是十八个，结果，不得已于二十五日撤退。（加里）
    【本报太岳十一日电】平遥民兵爆炸队反“扫荡”战斗中，五雷炸伤阎匪七名。上月二十三日，阎匪向我一区抢粮，首先进行“扫荡”，爆炸二中队即展开反“扫荡”，一面向各村发出情报，一面积极布置雷阵，在三岔要道与小马凹堰即埋下五颗地雷，全队设伏山头，准备痛击敌人。二十四日，阎匪四四师二团集中了“奋斗团”、“还乡团”及伪“乡村公所”一千余人，向我千庄、三岔口等进犯，半夜，阎匪进入我雷区，一连将五颗地雷都踏响了，炸伤阎匪七名，丢下步枪三支，其中并有当地群众最痛恨的倒算头子全保儿。此时阎匪再不敢前进，待至天明才继续前进，但附近群众已闻雷转移，毫无损失，因此当地群众就唱开了“铁雷本是生铁造，能给我们放下哨”。
