　　Yushe Cooperation Conference Discusses
　　Organizing the Masses for Winter Production
　　[Our Newspaper, Yushe News] The Yushe County convened a conference of over a hundred cooperative cadres on October 29th to review, exchange, and summarize experiences, clarify directions, and establish specific winter production plans. The meeting revealed that many cadres held ideas of underestimating cooperative work, feeling that economic work lacked real power and prospects. For example, Wang Er'man, the manager of Nilu River, said: "In the cooperative, we eat human food but do the work of livestock (grinding and carrying), the masses ignore us, and the cadres are rebuffed." Shi Liying believed that cooperatives were only doing business and had no future, etc. After discussion, Jia Quan'gen from Ding Village said: "As long as we serve the masses, the masses will support us, and if we ask the masses about things, everything can be done." Bai Baoquan from Bai Village said: "In 1943, the special agent landlord Zhang Wenda served as the accountant and cheated in the accounts, which led to collapse. Last year, another landlord, Liu Shengbao, squeezed in, adding water to the vinegar and deceiving people with the scales, lending money and extending credit based on poverty and wealth, so the farmers called the cooperative a 'exploitative cooperative,' and no one came to the door. After squeezing out feudalism, it is very different from before, proving that feudalism cannot be completely eliminated unless the farmers support it." Lu Zhiming from Nanwang Village is a peasant accountant. At first, he was worried that he would not be able to keep accounts, but the masses encouraged him to be bold. He said that he recorded a separate account book for each type of goods he sold (classified), and the income and expenses were clear. The masses reflected: "Squeezing out feudalism and doing it ourselves, the peasant accountant is wise." After discussion, everyone's direction became clear. Zhou Yousheng talked about how he had earned hundreds of thousands in more than a year, thinking that he had served the masses, but when collecting accounts, the farmers ridiculed him: "Who did you earn money for?" (because most of the shares were from rich peasants and landlords). Heyu suffered severe ice damage, with only 20-30% of the autumn harvest. The cooperative helped the masses calculate their assets, clear their minds, buy vegetable seeds, and store grain, wholeheartedly serving to overcome the famine, which won the support of the masses. Deputy County Chief Shi summarized two basic experiences based on everyone's discussion: first, clarify the class viewpoint and follow the mass line; second, operate businesses based on specific conditions and mass demands, so that the masses benefit and the cooperative can develop and consolidate. Then, the winter production plan was discussed. The Second District proposed to first let the masses examine the past shortcomings and improve relations with the masses. The plan is roughly as follows: (1) The district cooperative takes the lead in supporting small mutual aid cooperatives, transforming all the shops in the Second District into fire-starting shops, and transforming the market into a market for peasants' local products. (2) Organize men to carry and transport goods, exchanging melon seeds and eggs for cotton from Taigu; women organize spinning and weaving, all donkeys are mobilized, and semi-laborers dig medicinal herbs. (3) Develop animal husbandry, raising cattle and sheep, with the cooperative providing loans and support. (4) Promote the repair of all old carts by the masses to facilitate transportation. (5) Establish an economic intelligence station to regularly understand prices in various places. (6) Increase the number of donkeys by four in each village, with the cooperative helping the masses to buy them. In other areas such as Huijiao and Wujing, it was decided to focus on animal husbandry, cutting brambles, and digging medicinal herbs, relying on the mountains for sustenance. In Yunzu and Taoyang areas of the Third District, vigorously develop the woolen industry, with the cooperative supplying raw materials and promoting finished products, ensuring that labor, livestock, capital, and tools are not idle. Director Lu summarized everyone's opinions and put forward specific requirements for winter production this year: develop wide cloth throughout the county, add another hand-cranked machine to each village, and increase the number of spinning wheels with reverse rotation to eight to fifteen. The county and district cooperatives are responsible for organizing the export of mountain miscellaneous goods in small quantities, exchanging them for cotton and salt needed by the masses, achieving unified production, transportation, and sales, focusing on turning labor into capital, so that peasants can turn themselves over and over again, and everyone can plant rich roots in the cooperative. Guarantee the county party committee's call—men two stones of rice, women ten pounds of cotton, 100% completion. Finally, each village and cooperative made mutual challenges in competition, and everyone was full of confidence, preparing to fight a beautiful battle on the winter production front. (Shi Ning, Shou Li, Pei Zi, Rong Sheng)
　　[Our Newspaper, Licheng News] The Beiliu base point, in order to support the peasants who have turned themselves over and develop cooperative undertakings, was convened by Taihang cooperative hero Li Jiakui, on October 2nd the second cooperative meeting of the entire base point, asked this year in the disaster and poor harvest, how can we seek more benefits for the masses this winter? Everyone agreed that the cooperative should organize the masses to produce in large quantities, promote mountain goods, develop spinning, weaving, and transportation, actively support the small cooperative movement, and implement increased production to overcome the famine. Then, the winter production plan was discussed: (1) First, merge the six pharmacies, mainly in Beiliu, into one large one. (2) Clarify the cooperative route, never sell any enemy goods, support the masses in developing small cooperative undertakings, resolutely do not annex the cooperatives in various villages, and provide timely business information and guidance. (3) Mountain goods such as walnuts, dates, persimmons, and peanuts urgently need to be organized for export, and three branch stations should be established in Weizi Town, Henan Shop, and other places to facilitate mass transportation. (4) Because this base point is more than twenty miles away from the city, it is impossible to buy and sell in a timely manner. It is planned to help the masses organize small markets with Beiliu as the center. (5) Expand the base point cooperative to promote the cooperatives in various villages and overcome blind operation. (6) Establish a base point cooperative committee, with appropriate people elected by various villages to participate in unified leadership of winter production. Personnel have now been selected, and tools for making persimmon cakes and other items have been collected with a total share capital of 3.1 million yuan. (Pei Yi, Jia Kui, Wen Xiu)
