[Changzhi News] In order to inspect the autumn cultivation and leave no stubble, the Second District of Su Village immediately carried out manure accumulation after the autumn cultivation was completed. On the 2nd of this month, a meeting of cadres and activists was held to check if there was any remaining stubble and how to carry out the ten-day manure accumulation campaign. The inspection revealed that most of the work had been completed, with only a few field edges remaining, which could be dug up in one morning. During the discussion of the manure accumulation campaign, cadres had a "no way" mentality. For example, street leader Shen Fuxi said, "We only have a few acres of corn stalks, there is no way to get manure." Discovering this problem, the leadership proposed: if there are no corn stalks for manure, can we find other ways? Everyone discussed, and the result was that everyone clarified that accumulating manure is a major task. Labor hero Bi Eryun said, "The old saying goes: if you make manure this year, you won't worry next year. Our group has already specifically divided the work. All four animals in the group have been assigned: one animal is at the mill, and the other three are responsible for pulling coal to the coal kiln, led by Juhe, Wanhe, and Qisheng. In a few days, the snow will make the roads impassable, and it will be a big problem if we can't burn coal. These few warm days, my children and I will dig soil from the city wall and build four or five large 'tiger pits' (using soil clods to build circles, leaving an opening at the bottom, and burning clods inside), using the ash from the burned clods to be delivered to the saltpeter workshop, and the smoked pits will become good manure. Suoze, Changwang, Boze, Qiuzhe, and others are responsible for digging up the reclaimed wasteland and building pits to smoke it. Next year, the land will have manure, and there will be no more wasteland. If we dig it again in the spring, one acre will yield the harvest of two. My sister-in-law and two women are in charge of weaving cloth, and Bi Qiuzhe's wife leads five women to bundle cabbage and water it once." Under Eryun's speech, everyone unanimously recognized that it was time to reclaim wasteland and build pits for manure accumulation. Huang Quanshui said, "Eryun's method is right: specific division of labor, close cooperation, that way there will be no mistakes. The soil smoked in the pits has oil, and it loosens the soil when applied to the field, and it does not breed insects, it is very good. Leveling the city wall can increase the land for planting, and leveling the wasteland also reclaims it. Next year, the land will have manure, and the ash from the smoked pits can also be used to extract saltpeter." Political Director Zhang Fazhe said, "We must hurry up and do it. If we delay for a few more days and the ground freezes, the soil cannot be dug, and we will not be able to do it. Let's launch a ten-day manure accumulation campaign, first make a two-day plan, and win the red flag if we exceed the original plan." Eryun said, "My group can build one pit in two days with six people on the city wall, and five pits can be built in ten days. Four people can level and reclaim 1.3 acres of wasteland in one day, and three pits can be built in seven days. One pit has more than 300 cartloads of manure, and eight pits can pull 2,400 cartloads. Besides the stubble wheat, there are still 95 acres of autumn land, which can be fertilized with 25 cartloads per acre, and irrigating twice is better than clod manure." In this way, everyone unanimously decided to challenge manure accumulation, first make a two-day plan, and win the red flag if they exceed the plan. Everyone went down to set up signs on their own wasteland slopes, with the slogan: Leveling wasteland and building pits to accumulate manure, the manure accumulation campaign must be grasped tightly, exceeding the planned targets can win glory. The next day, women and children were bundling cabbage, and men with half labor were carrying hoes to level wasteland and build pits. (You Xue, Yongzhi, Xiangwen, Su Village Correspondents Group)

[Shexian News] Under the leadership of labor hero Zhang Xigui and production directors Zhao De, poor peasants Liu Jujin, and Liu Meilin in Piancheng Village, after the autumn cultivation competition, squeezing time and labor, they organized people to pull plows. The whole village originally planned to finish plowing in half a month, but on the 23rd, statistics showed that only 150 acres remained, which was completed in two days, totaling no more than ten days. The masses everywhere reflected: "If we hadn't grasped it tightly this year, the autumn land would never have been plowed!" Some said: "This year's autumn cultivation is really straightforward!" Then, on the evening of the 23rd, a mass meeting was held to discuss clearing the tail of the autumn cultivation and quickly accumulating manure within two days. Comrade Zhang Xigui again called: "We have already achieved not leaving an acre of stubble this year, and next year we must ensure that there is not a piece of unfertilized land!" Old man Liu Jujin said: "The autumn land is plowed, and this year's straw is scarce, so we have to cut more green grass to feed the animals, and the corn stalks in the fields must be soaked in water to make manure, only then can life be considered complete!" Chen Shuihe reported to everyone on the autumn cultivation inspection process at the base point, and praised Piancheng as good, further exciting the masses. Each street then discussed and set out their lives before the tenth day of the tenth lunar month, to complete cutting grass, chopping grass, and accumulating manure, with each acre having at least 30 loads.

　　苏店打破没办法思想
  　趁暖垒洞薰荒积肥
    【本报长治讯】二区苏店为了检查秋耕，不留一寸茬地，秋耕完后即进行积肥，于本月二号召开干部积极分子会议。检查到底还有茬地没有？如何开展十天积肥运动？检查结果大部已完，还有少数横头岸边，再有一早晨就能掘完。在讨论积肥运动时，干部都存在一种积肥没办法思想，如街长申福喜说：“咱只这几亩地玉茭秆，没办法弄粪。”发现这问题，领导上提出：没玉茭秆粪，是否能弄？让大家讨论，结果大家明确了积粪是大事。劳英毕二云说：“古语说：今年闹下粪，明年不发愁。我组已经具体分开了工，全组四个牲口，一个牲口在磨坊，其余三个牲口由聚合、万和、起胜三个人负责到煤窑拉煤，再等几天一下雪路就不能走啦，冻了烧不上煤也是个大事；这几天暂暖和，我和双则两个小孩两个老汉到城墙上扒城墙土，垒四、五个大老虎洞子（用土圪垃垒起圆圈，在下边丢一个口，往里烘圪＠薰），用圪＠烘上的灰交硝坊，薰上洞子就是好粪；锁则、长旺、柏则、秋则等四人负责，把填上的荒皮掘起来，也垒成洞子薰，明年地里也有了粪上啦，也没荒填啦，春天再掘一遍，一亩能顶二亩收；我嫂和二个妇女管织布，毕秋则老婆领导五个妇女捆白菜，浇一水白菜。”在二云的发言下，大家一致认识了现正该开荒垒洞子积肥，黄全水说：“二云的办法就是对，具体分工，密切合作，那样也误不了，垒上洞子薰上土有油气，上到地里又发松，又不生虫，可好哩，把城墙扒平能多种地，把荒填平了，也开了荒啦，明年地里还有粪上，薰洞灰还能交硝坊熬硝。”政治主任张发则说：“咱们得赶快干，再迟两天地上了冻，土掘不动，就不能干了，咱们开展十天积肥运动，先订两天计划，超过原计划就夺了红旗。”二云说：“我组城墙上六个人二天垒一个洞子，十天能垒五个，四个人一天平荒填一亩三分，七天也能垒三个洞子，一个洞子有三百多车粪，八个洞子能拉二千四百车，除赶茬麦，还有九十五亩秋地，一亩能上二十五车，灌上两遍，比圪＠粪还好。”这样大家一致决定挑战积肥，先订两天计划，超过计划就夺红旗，大家一致下去，先往自己荒填坡上订牌子，口号是：平荒垒洞来积粪，积肥运动要抓紧，订下计划能超过，夺了红旗真光荣。第二日妇女儿童都在捆白菜，男全半劳力都扛着锄平荒垒洞去了。（有学、永只、相文、苏店通讯组）
    【本报涉县讯】偏城村在劳英张喜贵及生产主任赵德、贫雇刘巨金、刘梅林等的领导下，经过秋耕大竞赛，挤时间挤劳力，组织了人拉犁，全村原计划半月耕完，结果在二十三日统计，只剩一百五十来亩，两天就完了，总计前后不过十天。群众到处反映：“今年要不是抓的紧，秋地永犁不完！”有的说：“今年的秋耕真干脆！”接着于二十三晚上召开了群众会，讨论两天内扫清秋耕尾巴快积肥，张喜贵同志又号召：“今年不留一亩茬地已做到了，明年还得保证不留一块没粪地！”刘巨金老汉说：“秋地犁完了，今年谷草缺，咱得多割些青草喂牲口，地里的玉茭秆等，咱得过水沤成粪，这样生活才算是完成！”陈水和给大家报告了基点秋耕检查经过，还数偏城好，更兴奋了群众。各街又讨论订出了十月初十前的生活，要完成割草，切草，积肥，每亩至少要上到三十驮。
