Shexian Sixth District Newly Promoted District Cadres Study to Improve Culture

[Reported by this newspaper from Shexian] Since the counter-offensive army went south, many cadres have been transferred from the Sixth District of this county. Most of the current district cadres have just come from the villages. They have little work experience and low cultural levels, especially the illiterate peasant cadres who cannot write reports and feel hopeless and without prospects. Hao Baogui said, "I agree very much to come out to work, but I am illiterate, which is really disappointing. When I worked in Qianchi Village, I couldn't write reports, so I became depressed and felt it was better to go home, so my work became passive." After the leadership understood this situation, they first solved the difficulties of illiterate comrades, and organized everyone to learn from each other in their work. Each time manpower was allocated, special attention was paid to assigning illiterate and literate comrades together, so that a mutual learning movement was launched. Four comrades including the illiterate Ma Wuying and Hao Baogui have now learned to write simple letters, and Wang Tongshun has learned to write work reports and can read the local edition of the Xinhua Daily. They were praised at each district cadre meeting, which greatly encouraged comrades who were not active in learning. For comrades who did not study, individual talks were held to persuade them to learn modestly and train themselves in practical work, without criticizing them in person. The district committee leadership proposed that whoever learns the most will make progress, and the illiterate should catch up with the literate. In the mutual correspondence between the district and each comrade, only real characters are written, so that each comrade can learn and read the letters, so as not to make him feel depressed at work. Secondly, in each stage of work summary, in order to improve everyone's ideological understanding and understand what is experience and what are shortcomings, democratic discussion and critical summary are implemented at each district cadre meeting. For example, at this autumn harvest and wheat planting summary meeting, each comrade had a notebook, and everyone took notes and summarized, and finally used the questions they had noted to start a free discussion to study what is experience and what are shortcomings. For example, Comrade Wang Tongshun said, "When I worked in Lingdi, I focused too much on investigating land reform issues and did not pay close attention to the current production work. This is a bias and should be corrected." This overcomes the old formalism, simply reporting, and only listening to the shortcomings of the final summary and deployment. After each stage of work summary, the next stage of work direction is studied. After this meeting, each comrade grasped the central link of sideline production, organizing transportation, and selling labor very closely, and their enthusiasm was unprecedentedly high. Zhao Xianzhen said, "We used to just listen to the political commissar's summary report. Isn't it better than before now?" Experience has proved that as long as the strength of the masses is brought into play, work will be carried out quickly and difficulties will be overcome quickly. (Zhenhua, Changqing)

　　涉县六区新提区干钻研工作提高文化
    【本报涉县讯】本县六区自反攻大军南下以来，干部调走很多，现在的区干部大部是村里才出来的。工作经验少，文化低，特别是不识字的农民干部，不会写汇报，感觉没希望、没前途。郝保贵说：“我出来工作倒很同意，就是不识字，实在败兴，我在前池村工作，不会写汇报，就苦闷起来，觉着不如回家好，工作就消沉下去。”领导上了解这种情况后，首先解决不识字同志的困难，就组织大家在工作中互相学习。每次分配力量时特别注意不识字和识字的同志分配在一起，这样开展了互相学习运动。不识字的马五英、郝保贵等四个同志现在学会写简单信，王同顺已经学会写工作汇报，能看下新华日报地方版来。在每次区干部会议上，都作了表扬，这样对学习不积极的同志鼓励很大。对不学习的同志个别谈话，劝说他虚心学习，在实际工作中锻炼自己，也不当面批评。区委领导上提出谁学习的多就能进步，不识字的要赶上识字的。区里和每个同志的互相通信上，一律写真字，这样使每个同志又能学习，又能看下信来，不使他工作苦闷。其次，在每段工作总结中，为提高大家的思想认识，明白啥是经验，啥是缺点，在每次区干部会议上实行民主讨论批判总结。如这次秋收种麦总结会议，每个同志都有笔记本，大家记，大家总结，最后再用自己记的问题展开自由讨论，研究啥是经验，啥是缺点。如王同顺同志说：“我在岭底工作，偏重于调查土改问题，对当前生产工作抓得不紧，这就是偏向，应该改正。”这样克服了旧的形式主义，单纯汇报，光听最后总结布置的缺点。从每段工作总结后，再研究出下段的工作方向是什么。这次会后，每个同志对副业生产、组织运输、卖工卖晌的中心环节抓的很紧，情绪空前高涨。赵献真说：“咱以前光听政委总结报告，现在该不是比以前强哩。”经验证明，只要发挥群众力量，工作就会很快开展，困难就会很快克服。（振华、长庆）
