    Nantian River Completes Autumn Plowing
    Seize the Opportunity to Vigorously Smother Uncultivated Land and Accumulate Fertilizer
    [This Dispatch from Changzhi] After the Second District's Nantian River completed the autumn harvest, it took another ten days of intensive work, and now the plowing is entirely completed. Taking advantage of the momentum, another ten-day plan was set to vigorously smother uncultivated land and accumulate fertilizer. Led by Labor Hero Cao Linshui's team, who started early and worked late, the village mobilized 86 male full laborers, 59 semi-laborers, 15 children, and 5 elderly men during the ten-day autumn plowing campaign. Women contributed 26 full laborers and 4 semi-laborers. In the ten-day effort, a total of 126.3 mu of land was dug, with each full laborer averaging one mu per day. Eleven head of livestock plowed 550 mu of land, with each head averaging five mu per day. During these ten days, women were also organized to vigorously process grain for autumn storage. The village had 11 mills, mobilizing 64 full and semi-laborer women, who milled 281 shi, 6 dou, and 6 ge of grain. Labor was also drawn to harvest 139 mu of wheat. The village has a total of 1,917 mu of autumn land, and it has now been universally plowed. Everyone has been very busy these days, and there are still corn stalks to be cleared, grass to be bundled, and beans to be threshed, with much of daily life left in the fields. However, everyone thought it would be better after the land was plowed, and they became complacent, with thoughts of taking a breather. For example, Jinbao said, "The land is all plowed, we can have a good rest now." Wang Angen said, "Our village has finished plowing the land, we are all exhausted, let it rain for a few days!" After discovering this problem, Labor Hero Cao Linshui convened a meeting of cadres and activists on the night of the 24th to study the situation and proposed: "Our village has shown great momentum in the autumn harvest and plowing. We, the entire cadre, must actively lead. Although our village has completed its work, there are still 500 mu of stubble land on the mountain that have not been plowed. Many livestock from Xinyi Village have been requisitioned, and they still have more than 3,000 mu of land that have not been plowed. Should we help them? But we still have corn stalks to clear, grass to bundle, and beans to thresh. The weather is getting colder day by day, and it will be really difficult to handle once the ground freezes. We must do it right away." After he finished speaking, everyone unanimously agreed. Wang Qihao said, "After our village finishes plowing, we should help the entire district finish plowing. Let's form a shock brigade for autumn plowing and go to Xinyi and Shantou to help. We'll go to whichever village sends a letter!" Wang Chouhai said, "We must also combine this with accumulating fertilizer. Now is still the time. One mu of corn stalks can smother two piles of uncultivated land. Each pile of uncultivated manure has more than 60 dan of manure. We have more than 800 mu of corn land. Except for the 310 mu of chopped stubble manure, the rest will all be solved with uncultivated and rotten manure." On the spot, the whole village drew up a ten-day plan to smother uncultivated land and accumulate fertilizer. Each group reported their labor force, and 64 full laborers formed a shock team, taking eight head of livestock to help Xinyi and Shantou with their autumn plowing. The slogan is: 'Helping other villages plow their land brings both fame and profit. Increased production in other villages brings glory to our village.'" The remaining all participated in accumulating fertilizer, and the work points were priced accordingly: 4 points for distant, ripe uncultivated land per mu, 2 points for nearby land per mu, and 8 points for chopped rotten land per mu. Even the 19 elderly men, 114 women, and 24 children all participated in the campaign to smother uncultivated land and accumulate fertilizer. (Sheng Xiu, Nantian River Correspondence Group)
