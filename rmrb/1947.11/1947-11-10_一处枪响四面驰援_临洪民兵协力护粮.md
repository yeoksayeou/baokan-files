One Shot Rings Out, Support Comes From All Sides
	Lin-Hong Militia Cooperate to Protect Grain

[This dispatch from our newspaper in Taiyue, dated 8th] The struggle to protect grain in the border area of Lin (Fen) and Hong (Tong) is becoming increasingly tense. In late October, the Chiang bandits in Linfen, suffering from shortages of clothing and food due to our encirclement, sent out small groups of bandits to plunder everywhere. At dawn on the 21st, more than 200 puppet security police raided the villages of East and West Duan and Lizhen in the Fourth District, looting more than 100 *shi* of grain, 165 *zhang* of cloth, and 74 items of clothing from the masses. Upon hearing this, our Linfen Yang Qingyuan Combat Team and Hongdong Expedition Team rushed to Xibaotou, using the high ground of Xibaotou village as a base, and divided into two groups to attack the enemy. Yang Qingyuan led one group himself, detouring to Dongbaotou to block the enemy. Machine gunner Mi Li'er accurately shot down two enemies, and Du Xiaohai shot down another with a cold shot. The enemy, attempting to break through, immediately stopped advancing. At this time, the Linfen Third District Chen Guangfa Combat Team also arrived, inserting themselves into the Xinjiu Lianli villages behind the enemy. The Huaiyi combat platoons of Hongdong, cooperating with the Dabao militia, also inserted themselves west from Wangya Village to the ridge of Xibaotou, cutting off the enemy's waist, making it difficult for them to advance or retreat. We then brought three-sided firepower to bear, firing at the enemy. After a fierce battle, the enemy only received reinforcements from Lizhen Village and fled in panic. In this battle, four enemies were killed and six wounded, while we suffered no losses. On the 24th, the Chiang bandits held a meeting in Shangyou Village, attempting to organize grain robbery. A company of the Hongdong Militia Expedition Team, led by Comrade Huang Daoming, cooperated with the Independent Battalion, surrounding Shangyou Village in three routes. As our main force entered the village, the enemy immediately opened fire from the "Watchtower," and we returned fire with machine guns, suppressing the enemy's firepower and driving them back, killing four enemies. In the past half-month, we have adopted a proactive approach, countering the enemy's movements, east when they go east, west when they go west, and have shattered the enemy's grain robbery plans, engaging in thirteen battles, killing or wounding forty-two enemies, and seizing three rifles, seven bombs, one hundred and fifty rounds of ammunition, and six head of livestock.

    一处枪响四面驰援
    临洪民兵协力护粮
    【本报太岳八日电】临（汾）、洪（洞）边沿区护粮斗争日渐紧张，十月下旬，临汾蒋匪因被我围困得少衣断食，便派出小股土匪四出抢劫，二十一日拂晓伪保警队二百余人窜至四区东西段村与里仁村一带，抢去群众粮食一百余石，布匹一百六十五丈，衣服七十四件，被我临汾杨清元战斗队与洪洞远征队闻讯，即飞奔西堡头，以西堡头村高地为依托，分两路合击敌人，杨清元自带一路迂回至东堡头阻击敌人，机枪射击手米里儿准准的射倒两个敌人，杜小孩以冷枪又放倒一名，企图突围之敌立即停止前进。此时临汾三区陈光发战斗队亦赶来，插到敌人后面的新旧练理村，洪洞怀义两个战斗排，配合大堡头民兵，亦由王雅村西插至西堡头岭上，将敌人拦腰截断，使其前后难顾，进退两难，我即发挥三面火力，向敌射击，经一阵激烈战斗后，敌才由里仁村增援，仓惶回窜。是役击毙敌四名，伤六人，我毫无损失，二十四日，蒋匪在上友村开会，企图组织抢粮，洪洞民兵远征队一个连，在黄道明同志的带领下，配合独立营，分三路向上友村包围，当我大队刚进村时，敌人便从“看家楼”上向下射击，我以机枪还击，将敌火力压下去，将敌击退，毙敌四名。半月来我采取主动作战，敌东我东，敌西我西，粉碎了敌人抢粮计划，共作战十三次，毙伤敌四十二名，缴获步枪三支，炸弹七颗，子弹一百五十余发，牲口六头。
