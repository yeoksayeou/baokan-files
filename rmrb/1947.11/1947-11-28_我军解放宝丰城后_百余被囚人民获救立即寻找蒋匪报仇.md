　　Our Army Liberated Baofeng City
  　Over a Hundred Imprisoned People Were Rescued and Immediately Sought Revenge on Chiang Kai-shek Bandits
    [Xinhua News Agency, Frontline, Henan, Hubei, and Shaanxi, 24th] Frontline reporter Lü Liang reported: After the People's Liberation Army liberated Baofeng, they immediately opened the prison gates. More than one hundred and fifty people imprisoned by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, illuminated by torches, cut through their shackles and fetters, and cheered as they rushed out of their cages. They immediately sought out the executioners who had abused them to take revenge. A Chiang Kai-shek bandit battalion commander temporarily hid in the prison posing as a prisoner, but was dragged out by everyone and handed over to the democratic government for handling. Furthermore, four officers disguised as new recruits were identified from among the prisoners. A female comrade of the former Central Plains Military Region, after being rescued from prison, found the Chiang Kai-shek Three Youth League organization section chief who had interrogated them with cruel torture. Many people, after regaining their freedom, requested to join the People's Liberation Army. The armed work team they organized searched out four hidden Chiang Kai-shek personnel in the city gate area the next day, along with twenty-three rifles and one machine gun.

　　我军解放宝丰城后
  　百余被囚人民获救立即寻找蒋匪报仇
    【新华社豫鄂陕前线二十四日电】前线记者吕梁报导：人民解放军解放宝丰后，立即打开狱门，一百五十多个被蒋匪监禁的人民，在火把照耀中砍断枷锁镣铐，欢呼着冲出囚笼。他们并立即相率寻找虐害他们的仇人刽子手报仇。有个蒋匪大队长临时藏在狱里冒充犯人，即被大家拉出交给民主政府办理，且从俘虏中认出假装新兵的四个军官。被救的前中原军区的一位女同志，出狱后就找出毒刑审讯他们的蒋匪三青团组织股长。许多人恢复自由后，均要求参加人民解放军，他们组织成的武装工作队，第二天在城关搜出四个匿藏的蒋匪人员，和二十三支枪一挺机枪。
