To the Editor:
　　Winter production campaigns are now underway in various regions to make up for poor harvests. The biggest difficulty for the masses is the issue of funding, which is what our bank loans are meant to address. Furthermore, in order to establish credit operations for cooperatives and unite the idle funds of the masses, loans must be issued through cooperatives to poor peasants, hired laborers, and newly emancipated masses to support their production. Recently, it was discovered in Shangyang Village, Fifth District, Heshun, that 300,000 yuan in winter production loans were allocated. The village cooperative took the funds back and went to Xingtai to engage in production without distributing them to the masses. Their reasoning is that the profits earned will be distributed to the poor peasants and hired laborers, which is also in line with the class line. If the cooperative does not organize and lead the masses in production in this way, how can a mass production movement be formed? I suspect that such practices are not uncommon in various places. My opinion is that loans must be given to the basic masses. Cooperatives can be responsible for organizing and leading the masses in production, which can both unite the private funds of the masses and unleash the productive power of the masses. Any paternalistic or bestowal-oriented view is incorrect. It is hoped that such situations in various places will be corrected.

　　上阳村合作社包办代替
  　扣用冬季生产贷款编辑同志：
    现在各地正在开展冬季生产运动，弥补歉收，群众最感困难的是资金问题，我们银行贷款也即为解决这个困难。又为了建立合作社的信用业务，团结群众游资，所以贷款必须通过合作社发放，贷给贫雇新翻身群众，扶植他们生产。近发现和顺五区上阳村，分配冬季生产贷款三十万元，该村合作社将款带回去，即带上去邢台生产了，没有发放到群众手里。他们理由是赚下钱红利分给贫雇群众，也是阶级路线。这样合作社不去组织领导群众生产，怎能形成群众性的生产运动？象这样作法各地恐怕也不少，我的意见是贷款必须放到基本群众手里，合作社可以负责组织与领导群众生产，这样既能团结群众的私资，又能发挥群众的生产力量。任何包办代替恩赐观点是不对的。各地如有此类情况者希加以纠正。
