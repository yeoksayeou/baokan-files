　　Strive for Early Spring Planting and Increased Production
  　Pingxiang First District Digs Ditches to Irrigate Land
    [Our Newspaper Pingxiang News] Last winter and this spring, seven villages including Guoqiao and Dadongguan in the First District irrigated 23,763 mu of land, enabling timely planting of large seedlings, which grew very vigorously. The unirrigated land was still a red soil, and small seedlings were not planted until July. In this comparison, the masses all said, "Not irrigating was a big loss!" The autumn harvest showed even greater disparities. The large seedlings planted on irrigated land yielded 215 jin of grain per mu. The late seedlings at best yielded 100 jin, and in the Xiwu Township near the Zhenxi Embankment, the late seedlings yielded almost nothing. In this comparison, the entire district, due to not seizing the opportunity last winter and this spring, had a total of more than 56,000 mu of land that could have been irrigated but wasn't, resulting in a loss of more than 5.8 million jin of grain, calculated at a loss of 115 jin per mu. This has attracted the high attention of cadres and the masses. Therefore, at the village cadre meeting for deploying the autumn storage campaign, an irrigation committee was organized to decide to simultaneously carry out autumn storage and plan ditch digging for irrigation. Currently, a ditch about 14 li long, running east from the Fu River to Dalaoying, capable of irrigating more than 25,000 mu of land, has been actively started on October 29th by a thousand young and strong laborers from eighteen villages. In addition, a ditch 740 zhang long from the Fu River to the Zhenxi Embankment has also been started simultaneously by young and strong laborers from twelve villages. The entire district has a total of thirteen sluice gates, and more than 12,000 zhang (about 70 li) of main ditches, all of which were opened on November 10th, striving to irrigate all of the district's more than 100,000 mu of land, laying the foundation for next year's major production.

    [Our Newspaper Jinnan Dispatch, 18th] Xishuangta in the Fourth District of Jize has precise organization, separate leadership, and vigorously mobilizes winter plowing, wheat irrigation, and fertilizer accumulation. On the evening of the 27th of last month, the village held a mass meeting and decided on the village's winter production plan: 1. Launch a winter plowing movement and step up fallowing. Except for wheat fields, all stubble fields and bare land must be plowed before the ground freezes, ensuring that the entire village has no bare land left this winter. 2. Wheat fields with wells should be irrigated at least once or twice before the ground freezes. 3. The masses of the entire village should accumulate large amounts of fertilizer, and workers, peasants, women's associations, militia, and children should all participate in the competition to dig manure pits or push composted soil. In order to complete the plan, the masses of the entire village were organized, and a leader was selected from each group to be responsible for leading and supervising the group's wheat irrigation, plowing, fertilizer accumulation, and other work. Village cadres led separately, with each village cadre responsible for inspecting two or three groups, and personally participating in the groups. Production group leaders' reporting meetings were held every five days. By comparing the reporting summaries with the facts that they usually inspected in the groups, they could understand the size and quality of the achievements of each group, commend the good in a timely manner, criticize the lagging, and discuss solutions when encountering difficulties.

　　争取明春早种增产
  　平乡一区挖沟浇地
    【本报平乡讯】一区郭桥、大东关等七个村去冬今春浇地二万三千七百六十三亩，及时种上大苗，苗长的很旺。未浇的地还是一片红土，直到七月才耩上小苗。在这种对比下，群众都说：“没浇地吃了大亏！”秋季收成悬殊更大，浇地种上的大苗，每亩收粮二百十五斤。而晚苗好的才收一百斤，西五乡靠近振西堤一带，晚苗简直没收成。这样对比，全区由于去冬今春未抓紧，能浇而未浇之地共五万六千余亩，每亩按少收一百十五斤计算，则少收粮食五百八十余万斤。这样，引起干部和群众的高度注意，因此在布置秋屯的村干大会上，即组织浇地委员会，决定一面秋屯，一面计划挖沟浇地。现一长约十四里的沟，东自滏河西至大老营，能浇地二万五千亩以上，已由十八个村的千名青壮年于十月二十九日积极动工。另外从滏河到振西堤长七百四十丈的沟也已由十二个村的青壮年同时动工。全区共十三个闸，干沟一万二千余丈（约七十余里），全部于十一月十日开放，争取将全区十万余亩地全部浇完，给明年大生产打下基础。（志强、郭瑛、小蕖、玉庆）
    【本报冀南十八日电】鸡泽四区西双塔精密组织，分头领导，大力发动冬耕、浇麦积肥。上月二十七日晚上，该村召开群众会，决定了今冬全村生产计划：一、展开冬耕运动，加紧垡地。除了麦地，不论茬地和白地，在地冻前都要犁完，保证今冬全村不剩一亩白地。二、有井的麦地，在上冻前至少要浇一水或两水。三、全村群众大量积肥，不论工、农、妇会、民兵、儿童都参加竞赛挖粪坑，或推沤脏土。为了完成计划，又把全村群众都组织起来，组中选组长一人，负责领导与督促本组浇麦、犁地、积肥等工作。村干分头领导，每个村干负责检查两三个组，并亲身参加到组中去。每隔五天，召集生产组长汇报会议一次。把汇报总结与自己素常在组中检查的事实对照一下，就可明白各组作的成绩大小和好坏，好的及时表扬，落后的批评，遇到困难，大家商讨解决。
