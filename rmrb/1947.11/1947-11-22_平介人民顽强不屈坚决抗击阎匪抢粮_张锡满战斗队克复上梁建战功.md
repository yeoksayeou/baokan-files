　　【This Newspaper, Taiyue, 20th Dispatch】Yan bandits attempted to achieve the purpose of robbing grain by means of terror, but the unyielding people continued to resolutely resist. On the 2nd of this month, the 2nd Brigade of the 44th Division of Yan bandits from Xiquan and Qidong, Pingyao, in coordination with the "Struggle Corps" of the countryside, raided and surrounded more than ten villages including Shangxia Shennan to rob grain. After the masses in Shangxia Shennan discovered this, they immediately fled with the old and young into the coal mine caves. The Yan bandits chased them to the entrance of the cave and carried out bloody massacres with terrifying means, and piled up firewood and grass to burn, smoking the cave from dawn until the second watch of the night. Before leaving, they filled in the entrance of the cave. After the Yan bandits left, the militia of Xia Shennan rushed to dig and rescue, saving more than 60 people. It is estimated that more than 20 people were burned to death by the Yan bandits, and 14 people were brutally killed by the Yan bandits. After hearing the news, the masses in nearby villages did not succumb to this, and unanimously expressed their determination to avenge the dead brothers and actively arm themselves. In addition, the Yan bandit "Struggle Corps" and the Security Police Brigade of Jiexiu robbed grain from Jianli Village on the 29th of last month. A villager named Jin Chun'er was captured because he could not transfer in time. The Yan bandits immediately coerced him to tell the location of the grain storage. Jin Chun'er sternly refused and said, "I would rather die alone than let everyone starve to death." While speaking, he jumped into a nearby well. After the Yan bandits retreated, the masses immediately rescued him from the well. The people of Pingyao and Jiexiu said, "We can't let the bandits rob a single grain for nothing."

　　【This Newspaper, Taiyue, 20th Dispatch】The combat team of Zhang Ximan and others in Jiexiu has again established meritorious service, removing the Yan bandit stronghold in Shangliang and killing and wounding 24 Yan bandits, including the company commander. On the morning of the 3rd, Yan bandit Zhao Pengfei led his followers and forcibly occupied our Shangliang Village. The Zhang Ximan combat team, taking advantage of their unstable foothold, joined the militia of Xijiawan and Banyu and other villages to immediately counterattack, killing and wounding 18 Yan bandits and recovering 55 sheep. The bandits fled in panic. On the 5th, the Yan bandits, with their beastly hearts undeterred, again invaded Shangliang. The Zhang Ximan combat team placed "returning thunder" in the village in advance and arranged a minefield in the north of the village. After repelling three assaults by the Yan bandits, they immediately maneuvered and transferred, allowing the bandits to enter the village and step on three mines, killing six people, and then fled in panic again. On the 7th, the Yan bandits attacked Shangliang for the third time and were still repelled. Also, Song Shengze, a combat hero from the Fourth District, also laid three mines in Mabao, Xiaojin, and Xingdi on October 30th. When the Yan bandit 219th Regiment advanced to these three villages, they also hit three mines in a row, killing five people including the company commander and a large horse.

　　【This Newspaper, Tangyin News】To fiercely attack the Chiang bandits' encroachment and grain robbery, our Independent Detachment and the Third District Armed Work Team, combined with the militia of the Third and Sixth Districts, annihilated 31 enemies in one fell swoop, captured the enemy stronghold in Jianghe, and seized three rifles. After the Chiang bandits occupied Tangyin City, they used Jianghe and Anshang as bases to carry out encroachment and grain robbery to the west. On the morning of the 10th of this month, the enemy heard our gunshots and immediately gathered 70 to 80 people, carrying large flags and arrogantly chasing the militia while waving flags and shouting, chasing all the way to Lijia Xincun. Unexpectedly, we inserted into the enemy's flank. When the enemy discovered this, they fled in panic. We immediately occupied Jianghe and pursued to the east of the railway, and also repelled more than 300 reinforcements from Dahuang Village. According to statistics, we captured seven enemies, killed 17 enemies, wounded seven enemies, seized three rifles, 77 rounds of ammunition, one grenade, red-tasseled spears, broadswords, and a local cannon. We suffered no casualties, creating a model battle case of zero to thirty-one.

　　【Another Dispatch】On the same day, another armed work team of ours captured Sanlitun, three miles away from the city, and drove the enemy away. At the same time, another group of enemies attacked our army's station in Daxiaoguang Village in three routes, but were all repelled by us, killing three enemies and wounding five enemies. We suffered no casualties. (Shen Zhi)
