    "Take Good Care of Home Production So We Can Go to War Again Next Time"
    [This newspaper's Ping Shun News] Three comrades from Wang Qu, Fourth District, who participated in the war have now returned victoriously and are very happy to see that the village has taken good care of them. Wang Chongde (middle peasant) said: "The village chief transferred me to the war before, and I didn't want to go. Once I got to the south of the Yellow River, my thoughts were very happy. I didn't want to come back when the superiors transferred me back. On the way back, I thought that there were ten acres of land at home, and I didn't know how the cadres would take care of it. When I got home, I put down my weapon and ran to the land. I saw that the production team had planted seven acres of wheat for me. The small seedlings were growing green, and all of them had been topped. The team plowed the wheat field for me, all plowed to three furrows, and the two and a half acres of autumn land were plowed twice. Some cotton had also been harvested. The autumn harvest, planting wheat, and plowing the land were done better than when I was at home." Wang Youcheng (newly turned over peasant) was walking on the road, thinking about his home, and rushed home in the dark. As soon as he entered the door, he saw his old mother, children, wife, etc. His mother said: "After you left to participate in the war, the cadres and the team leader took care of our family. The firewood and water for the autumn harvest and wheat planting, whatever needed to be done, they allocated labor to do it automatically. Our five acres of cotton were harvested by the team for more than 300 catties of seed cotton. The four acres of wheat field were all plowed three times and planted. The autumn land was all plowed twice for us. I have lived for a lifetime, and I have never heard of plowing the land twice after autumn." After Wang Youcheng listened to his mother's visit to the home production, he said: "I will go again if I am transferred to the war again." The three of them in the village extensively publicized the suffering of the old people in the newly liberated areas they had passed through. The masses in the village unanimously felt the freedom and happiness of their own lives. (Shuān Fāng, Dé Chén, Sān Kē)

    “家中生产照顾好下次参战还要去”
    【本报平顺讯】四区王曲三个参战同志，现已胜利归来，看到村中照顾周到，都十分高兴。王崇德（中农）说：“前者村长调我去参战，我不愿去，一到黄河南边，思想很高兴，上级回调我就不想回来。在半路又想到家里有十亩地，不知干部照顾如何，回家放下武器，就往地跑，去地看到生产小队给我种的七亩麦田，小苗长的绿油油，均已倒针，队内给我翻的麦田，均翻到三犁，二亩半秋地，垡了两遍，有些棉花也收好啦。秋收种麦垡地，比我在家还搞的好”。王有成（新翻身户）走在路上，思想挂念着家，搭黑往家跑，一进门就见老母亲、孩子、妻等，他母亲说：“你参战走后，干部与小队长照顾咱家庭，柴水秋收种麦，该做什么，就拨工来自动做啦。咱种五亩棉花，小队给咱收回籽花三百余斤。麦田四亩，均翻三犁种上。秋地均是给咱垡到两遍。我活了一辈子，没有听说过秋后垡地垡两遍。”王有成听他母亲访罢家中生产后说：“再调参战我还去。”他三个在村上，把他们所走过的新解放区老百姓的痛苦，大量宣传，该村群众都一致感到自己生活的自由幸福。（拴芳、得臣、三科）
