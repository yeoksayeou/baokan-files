Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st. Comprehensive reports: The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, carrying out the orders of the American imperialists, is increasingly frantic in its slaughter of patriots and peaceful people. According to extremely incomplete statistics from foreign news agencies and newspapers in the Chiang-controlled areas, in this month alone, the bloody hands of the Chiang bandits have arrested and killed over two thousand one hundred people in just eight cities: Shanghai, Hangzhou, Beiping, Baoding, Tangshan, Changchun, Xi'an, and Guangzhou. The planned campaign of murderous terror by the Chiang family gang is still developing. According to a TASS dispatch from Nanjing quoting the Hong Kong Hua Shang Pao, on September 27th, the executioner Chiang Kai-shek convened a secret meeting in Nanjing of his intelligence chiefs from various locations. The blacklist included over 60,000 people, with a quota of over 3,000 arrests pre-determined in Shanghai alone.

The number of people arrested in various locations from the beginning of this month to date: Shanghai, over 250 people; Hangzhou, over 100 people; Guangzhou, over 500 people; Changchun, over 900 people in one day alone (20th, Moscow oral broadcast); Hankou, over 300 people (Associated Press, Nanjing, 23rd); Beiping, 24 people; Baoding, 6 people; Tangshan, 2 people; Xi'an, on one day the 7th alone, the Northwest General Branch负责人 Du Binqing of the Democratic League and 20 others were shot (United Press, Nanjing, 12th). (Sources are from previous reports from this agency unless otherwise noted.)

The bloody claws of the Chiang bandits have reached workers, students, cultural circles, education circles, members of the Democratic League, and even Chiang Kai-shek's close secretary, Chen Bulei's daughter, Chen Lian, and key members of miscellaneous generals such as Sun Lianzhong and Li Zongren, such as Yu Xinqing, chairman of the Political Design Committee of the Chiang bandit Baoding Pacification Headquarters, Zhang Aisong, Secretary-General of the Hebei Provincial Government, and more than a dozen others.

An Associated Press dispatch from Beiping on the 1st pointed out that the developing wave of arrests and killings is used to "deal with liberals and those whom Nanjing considers to be too independent (i.e., not directly affiliated with Chiang Kai-shek)."

U.S. President's special envoy, Wedemeyer, ordered Chiang Kai-shek to "purge the rear" and extinguish the "anti-American movement." Since then, Chiang Kai-shek has been even more frantically slaughtering the Chinese people. Chiang Kai-shek's current escalation of arrests and killings of Chinese people is inseparable from the fact that the U.S. imperialists are accelerating their aid to Chiang to destroy China. In his report on his visit to China, American warmonger Bullitt falsely accused that "five percent of the students in the Chiang-controlled areas are working for the CCP," demanding that Chiang Kai-shek "immediately conscript them and subject them to indoctrination before sending them to the front lines," which is actually demanding that Chiang Kai-shek arrest all awakened patriotic and democratic students and send them to fascist concentration camps. According to the Shanghai Continental Press, Bullitt's report "is in fact issued to execute the instructions of the United States Department of State." The truth about American imperialism directly commanding Chiang Kai-shek to arrest and kill patriotic and democratic Chinese people has been completely exposed.

### 美帝直接指挥蒋介石  疯狂捕杀爱国人民  一个月中被迫害者达两千多

    美帝直接指挥蒋介石
    疯狂捕杀爱国人民
    一个月中被迫害者达两千多
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】综合报导：蒋介石匪帮执行美帝国主义者的命令，对爱国人士与和平人民的屠杀日益疯狂。据外国通讯社及蒋区报纸极不完整统计，本月来仅在上海、杭州、北平、保定、唐山、长春、西安、广州八地蒋匪的血手即逮捕屠杀了二千一百余人以上。蒋家匪帮有计划的杀人恐怖还在发展中，据塔斯社南京电引香港华商报消息：九月二十七日刽子手蒋介石曾在南京召集其各地特务头子举行秘密会议，被列入黑名单内者计达六万余人，仅在上海一地即预定逮捕三千余人。
    本月初迄今各地被捕的人数：计上海二百五十余人，杭州百余人，广州五百余人，长春仅四日一日内即九百余人（二十日莫斯科口语广播），汉口三百余人（美联社南京二十三日电），北平二十四人，保定六人，唐山二人，西安仅七日一日内即枪杀民盟西北总支部负责人杜斌丞等二十人（合众社南京十二日电）。（来源除注明者外，均见本社以前报导）。
    蒋匪血腥魔手遍及工人、学生、文化界、教育界、民盟盟员、甚至蒋介石亲信秘书陈布雷的女儿陈琏及杂牌将领孙连仲、李宗仁部下要员，如蒋匪保定绥署政治设计委会主委余心清、河北省政府秘书长张爱松等十余人亦在内。
    美联社北平一日电指出，发展中的逮捕屠杀浪潮是用以“对付自由主义分子及南京认为立场过于独立的（按即非蒋贼嫡系）分子的。”
    美国总统特使魏德迈曾命令蒋介石“肃清后方”，扑灭“反美运动”，自那时起蒋介石就更加疯狂地屠杀中国人民。目前蒋介石变本加厉地逮捕杀戮中国人，是与美帝正加紧援蒋亡华的事实不可分的。美国战争贩子布立特在访华报告中诬指目前蒋区学生中“有百分之五是为中共工作的”，要求蒋介石“立刻征召，并在派赴前线作战以前，施以感化教育”，实际上即是要求蒋介石把觉悟的爱国民主学生全部加以拘捕，送入法西斯集中营。按照上海大陆报的说法，布立特的报告，“事实上是执行美国国务院的指令而发表的”。美国帝国主义直接指挥蒋介石逮捕杀戮爱国民主的中国人，事实真相业已暴露无遗。
