Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th – The Chiang party’s sham election has resulted in dog-eat-dog infighting due to disputes over the distribution of spoils, revealing numerous scandals:

	▲ The Tianjin Yi Shi Bao's Nanjing dispatch on the 28th of last month stated: During a reception for reporters held by the Kuomintang members participating in the sham election, Wang Guanying confessed on the spot that "the nomination of candidates is purely the result of being monopolized, divided up, and ruled." Kong Qingzhao also admitted that this sham election "has no truly representative candidates of the people. These gentlemen are actually candidates appointed by imperial decree." He also stated that "most of the candidates in Jiangxi are relatives and friends of party and government leaders. The director of the Jiangxi Prison Bureau is even included among the labor union candidates." A female representative, Ms. Li, confessed that among the four female "National Assembly" candidates in Anhui, three are officials' wives, and one is the concubine of a department head. Wang Nai＠ stated that the nominations in Sichuan were entirely monopolized by Deng Xihou and Huang Jilu, and most of those nominated are local bullies and ruffians, bought with banknotes.
	
	▲ According to a Tianjin Yi Shi Bao report: In this sham election, almost all the female "National Assembly" and female "Legislative Yuan" candidates have been seized by concubines. Even a French wife of a prominent figure who does not understand Chinese was included as a candidate. Among the female "Legislative Yuan" candidates in Fujian Province, there is also a niece of a certain speaker who is underage and still in high school. When the Chiang bandit Legislative Yuan held a meeting on the 30th of last month, a legislator said: "If concubines are all elected as 'legislators,' the Legislative Yuan will become a 'vase' display."
	
	▲ In the first election of puppet senators in Changchun City in mid-September, according to statistics, voters accounted for only one-fifth of the city's 600,000 population, and two-thirds of the 120,000 voters abstained, with only 40,000 people actually voting. Among the 51 elected senators, the most votes received were a little over a thousand, and the fewest were only two hundred. On the day of the "election" on September 14th, many farces were staged. The most exciting was the fight between election supervisor Li Ruizeng and Bi Zeyu, the speaker of the Jilin Provincial Provisional Senate, over the ballot papers, resulting in black eyes and swollen faces. Afterwards, both sides published large advertisements in the newspapers, attacking each other. Li called Bi an "evil force," while Bi scolded Li as a "schemer," bickering endlessly.

　　蒋党伪选丑剧侧影
  　分帐不匀打得面青脸肿
    妇女候选人尽是姨太太
    【新华社陕北十五日电】蒋党伪选因分帐不匀而作狗咬狗之闹，因此被揭露之丑剧甚多：
    ▲津益世报上月廿八日南京专电称：参加伪选国民党党员联谊会招待记者时，王冠英当场供称：“候选人提名，纯系包办、分赃，统治”之结果。孔庆诏亦供认此次伪选“无真正代表民意之候选人，衮衮诸公，实系钦命候选人。”并称：“江西候选人大部为党政首脑亲故，江西监务局长竟列入工会候选人之内。”妇女代表李某则供称：安徽四个女“国代”候选人，其中三人系官太太，一人且为某厅长的姨太太。王乃＠供谓：四川提名全由邓锡侯、黄季陆包办，被提名的多系土豪流氓，用钞票收买的。
    ▲据天津益世报消息：此次伪选中，女“国代”及女“立委”候选人，几已全为姨太太霸占，即连某显要不懂华语之法国太太，亦被列入候选人。闽省女“立委”中，且有某议长之未及法定年龄、尚在高中念书之甥女。蒋匪立法院于上月三十日开会时，某立委发言说：“姨太太均获选‘立委’，立法院将成‘花瓶’陈列所”。
    ▲九月中蒋匪长春市首届御用参议员的选举中，据统计选民仅占全市六十万人口的五分之一，而十二万选民中弃权的又有三分之二，实际投票者，只有四万人。五十一名中选的参议员票数最多的是千把张，最少的则只有两百来张。九月十四日“选举”那天，演出了不少丑剧，最精彩的是监选人李瑞增与吉林省临参会议长毕泽宇，因争夺选票，互相打得面青额肿；事后双方又在报上大登广告，互相攻讦，李称毕为“恶势力”，毕又骂李为“阴谋分子。”哓哓不休。
