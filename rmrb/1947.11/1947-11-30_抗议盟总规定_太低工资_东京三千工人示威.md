　　Protesting Allied Headquarters' "Too Low Wages"
  　3,000 Workers Demonstrate in Tokyo
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th] Tokyo dispatch: On the 21st, 3,000 Japanese workers demonstrated again in Tokyo, protesting against the Allied Headquarters (US military headquarters stationed in Japan) for paying "too low wages" to its employed Japanese workers. The demonstrating workers held red flags and carried various signs and banners with slogans such as: "No more working for the Allied (American) forces!" "Strikes demanding wage increases will not stop!" The marching队伍 formed four columns and arrived in front of the foreign affairs department, chanting: "We demand a monthly salary of 3,000 yuan!" "We demand an extra subsidy of 500 yen for each family!" Many Japanese secretaries and stenographers in the foreign affairs department stood at the windows, cheering and saluting the demonstrating masses. According to the demonstrators, the average wage supported by the government is 1,800 yuan, but the Allied Headquarters only pays a monthly salary of 1,600 yuan. For two months, Japanese workers' disguised strikes directly opposing the Allied Headquarters have been increasing daily. Workers are using methods such as feigning illness and other forms of going slow to replace directly leaving their jobs to strike.

　　抗议盟总规定“太低工资”
  　东京三千工人示威
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】东京讯：二十一日日本三千工人再度示威，抗议盟总（驻日美军总部）对其雇庸之日本工人支付“太低工资”。示威工人手持红旗，并携有各种牌子和旗帜，上书：“不再为盟（美）军工作”！“不停止要求增加工资的罢工！”等口号。游行队伍行成四路纵队抵外交部门前，高呼：“我们要求每月三千元工资”！“要求发给每家五百圆额外补助费！”外交部的许多日本书记和速记员均伫立于窗口向示威群众欢呼和致敬。据示威群众称，政府支持的平均工资为一千八百元，但盟总只支付一千六百元之月薪。两个月以来，日本工人直接反对盟总之变相罢工，正与日俱增，工人以装病及其他怠工方法来代替直接离开职务的罢工。
