    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th. TASS, Ottawa, 6th: The running dog of U.S. imperialism, the Canadian government, continues to aid the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang with armaments to slaughter the Chinese people. The Toronto Star of Canada disclosed: 2,500 tons of machine gun bullets and a large number of military orders were handed over to the Chiang Kai-shek government on November 3rd in Montreal (located on the east coast of Canada, close to the U.S. border). Prior to this, the Canadian government had aided Chiang in the civil war with 150 Mosquito bombers and a $60 million loan. The Canadian government had claimed that 25 million of the 60 million yuan loan could be used to purchase Canadian military supplies. The CCP Central Committee's statement on Canada's aid to Chiang in the civil war with aircraft and loans sternly pointed out: The Canadian reactionary government, through this kind of behavior, reveals itself to be an accomplice of U.S. imperialism in its criminal acts of aggression against China. The Chinese people will forever remember this naked crime of the Canadian government in helping the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang slaughter the Chinese people, and the Canadian reactionaries will certainly one day reap the bitter fruit of their own sowing.

    美帝走狗加拿大政府
    续以军火援蒋内战
    必有一天自食恶果
    【新华社陕北八日电】据塔斯社渥太华六日消息，美帝国主义走狗加拿大政府，继续以军火援助蒋家匪帮屠杀中国人民。加拿大多伦多明星报披露：二千五百吨的机枪子弹及大批军火定货，已于十一月三日由蒙特利尔（该地位于加拿大东岸，紧靠美国边境）移交给蒋介石政府方面。在此以前，加政府曾以一百五十架蚊式轰炸机，及六千万美元贷款援蒋内战。加政府曾宣称六千万元贷款中之二千五百万元可用于购买加拿大军用物资。中共中央关于加拿大以飞机及贷款援蒋内战之声明，曾严厉指出：加拿大反动政府以此种行为揭露自己是美国帝国主义在侵略中国的罪恶行为中的帮凶。加拿大政府此种赤裸裸地帮助蒋介石匪帮屠杀中国人民的罪行，中国人民将永远记住，并且必定有一天加拿大反动派将自食其自己种下的恶果。
