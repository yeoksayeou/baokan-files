　　Qiu County's Experience in Saving and Preparing for Famine
    [Report from our newspaper in Southern Hebei, 11th] The Qiu County Party Committee has summarized the experiences and achievements of the county's Save and Prepare for Famine campaign, and calls for its thorough implementation to better support the counter-offensive and welcome victory.

    The summary first recounts the changes in the leadership's understanding of saving and preparing for famine: After receiving the district Party committee's instructions on saving and preparing for famine, the county committee clarified the spirit of saving and preparing for famine. Through mass ideological education, most villages in the county formed a Save and Prepare for Famine movement. At the beginning, the masses were called upon to recall the suffering inflicted on the people by the great famine of 1932. The people's emotions for saving and preparing for famine were heightened during the recollection. However, they felt there was no way to save. Therefore, the leadership proposed that good cadres, activists, and labor heroes take the lead in formulating specific saving and famine preparation plans for each family. For example, Wang Laoyu from Zhendonghuo used fine grains (wheat) to exchange for coarse grains, saving 300 catties of wheat per month. Wang Wanxin picked vegetables himself, saving half a catty of grain per person per day. A certain mutual aid team in Gucheng Camp, with a total of fifteen people, saved 36,000 yuan just by not buying colored cloth in their savings plan. The actions also educated the leadership, making the county committee itself more resourceful and confident in saving, and proposed recognizing models to further promote the movement. Later, there was widespread rainfall, and the whole county planted seeds, and autumn seedlings gradually emerged. Some cadres and the masses thought that there was no need to prepare for famine, and they breathed a sigh of relief. The leadership also neglected saving, and the pain of the great famine gradually faded. The paralyzing thought of preventing drought and preparing for famine grew along with the autumn seedlings. It was not until the beginning of August, when it was estimated that the autumn harvest would only be 50-60%, and seeing reports of many areas without sufficient rain, the leadership was reminded again, believing that saving and preparing for famine must continue to be thoroughly implemented.

    Second, the masses' understanding of saving and preparing for famine: Since the call for saving and preparing for famine was issued, it was discovered in the masses' deliberation and discussion that the masses had many ideological obstacles that hindered the development of the saving movement. Qiu Shuyu, a cadre from Matou Village, said: "We just got through the famine, there can't be another famine." Some also said: "There is a major famine every thirty years and a minor famine every twenty years. We just got through the famine, there can't be another famine. There won't be no rain, if it rains late, the late seedlings will still yield a lot. As long as there is some harvest, it will be enough to eat." Some said: "The Eighth Route Army won't let us starve. During the great famine of 1932, we didn't starve to death. Now there are no enemies, we can eat anywhere!" Everyone fantasized about waiting for rain and was unwilling to save. These ideological obstacles were gradually overcome through a period of education. When the autumn seedlings emerged, they forgot about saving, only seeing the seedlings, and the argument of "three tenths harvest when seeing seedlings" became prevalent again. They were unwilling to save even a little, always relying on the heavens and external aid, hindering the development of the saving movement.

    Third, basic experience in launching the saving movement: (1) Mass ideological education, entrusting the spirit of saving to the masses themselves. At first, the leadership and cadres felt that there was no way to start, but when the task was handed over to the masses, and after mobilization, the masses themselves came up with ideas. These ideas and saving facts educated the leadership and the cadres, and this kind of mass creation was used to further guide the in-depth development of the movement. The Save and Prepare for Famine movement in Qiu County was launched in this process. Liu Yunggu, a village cadre, challenged other villages at the district village cadre meeting. The village cadre of Nanliu Village satirized Liu Yunggu, saying: "Your village has always been about eating and drinking lavishly. Among the villages in this area, your village is the most corrupt. There are many wine shops, restaurants, and food stalls." After returning to the village, Liu Yunggu convened a mass meeting, first talking about the drought and lack of rain and the suffering of the 1932 famine, and said: "Other villages know that our village likes to eat well, but now our village can't eat anymore." The masses recalled the various sufferings during the great famine, and the groups discussed. Some said: "Saving the top of the granary is not saving the bottom of the granary. If we didn't save earlier in 1932, it was too late to save later." After discussion, it was proposed to exchange fine grains for coarse grains, implement mixing chaff and eating vegetables, and not drink or smoke or buy food, and mutual supervision was carried out. Under the masses' own discussion, ideas were found, and later there were no more wine sellers and no more food sellers. A steamed bun seller from another village went to Liu Yunggu to sell steamed buns. An old woman took a catty of wheat to exchange for steamed buns because her child was sick. She looked around and went back and forth, afraid to exchange. Someone asked her and she told the truth, saying: "Everyone is telling us to save and economize, I'm afraid people will laugh at me for exchanging steamed buns." She realized that being gluttonous was shameful. From this village, the cadres were educated that as long as the task is entrusted to the masses, there will be ideas and it will form the masses' own movement. Based on the experience of this village, the leadership put forward the slogan "Recalling the Great Famine of 1932, being gluttonous and lazy is really shameful," which directly promoted the masses' saving movement after the recollection. In Xiangchenggu market, people drinking alcohol were everywhere in the past. After each village recalled, there was no phenomenon of drinking in the market. The three restaurants in Liang Erzhuang market used to sell three big pigs every day, but later they didn't sell even a catty. At the First District District and Village Cadre Conference, they competed not to smoke paper cigarettes. The village cadres supervised each other after returning to the village, and no one dared to smoke, which influenced the masses and created a saving atmosphere. (2) Activists take the lead in promoting the movement: Xing Jixiu's mutual aid team in Gucheng Camp, upon hearing about saving, everyone recalled the suffering of 1932 and formulated their own saving plan: not smoking foreign cigarettes, making sesame leaf cigarettes themselves, which could save 46,000 yuan; not buying colored cloth, wearing gray clothes, which could save more than 100,000 yuan. Not wearing undershirts in summer. His team not only influenced this village, but also influenced the surrounding villages. For example, the masses in Chengjiao proposed to learn from Xing Jixiu's team. The leadership of the Fourth District used Xing Jixiu's experience to promote the entire district. Wang Wanxin of Zhuangtou first picked vegetables himself, ate them for a few days, calculated that it saved half a catty of rice per person per day, and then went to educate the masses, forming a vegetable picking movement throughout the village. The Fourth District promoted the entire district using the saving methods of Xing Zhenhua, a labor hero from Dazhai: After Xing Zhenhua heard the district's saving call, he returned to his group and held a meeting to discuss not smoking foreign cigarettes. He calculated the accounts for everyone, each person smoking five foreign cigarettes a day, costing 50 yuan, 1,500 yuan a month, and 18,000 yuan a year. Five people would need 74,000 yuan a year. He also said: "If we had this money in 1932, we five wouldn't have starved like that." The whole group made specific plans: (1) not smoking foreign cigarettes, not drinking alcohol (2) exchanging wheat for coarse grains, saving money to buy cattle (3) not buying colored cloth, wearing gray clothes. Xing Zhenhua said: "I have prepared 7,000 yuan to buy colored cloth, and I won't buy it either." After the accounting experience of this group was announced at the village mass meeting, after a few days, all the masses in the village automatically stopped smoking and drinking. Not smoking foreign cigarettes alone can save 420,000 yuan in seven months. The whole village not buying colored cloth and using gray cloth dyed with old duck claws can save 834,000 yuan. Other methods such as exchanging fine grains for coarse grains, and not eating and drinking extravagantly at weddings and funerals were also formulated. The cadres of the Fourth District studied and promoted this experience. The First District used Nanliu Village's saving plan to promote Wang Wanxin's vegetable picking throughout the district. These specific examples and the leadership methods of labor heroes, from individual model roles to the whole group, the whole village, the whole district, and even the whole county, made the saving movement universally developed. (3) The commendation of models and meritorious service movement guaranteed the realization of the saving plan. Wang Dianchen's team in Taozhai, the Second District, has been electing models fifteen times since the spring saving production plan, once every half month or ten days, and drawing some money from sideline production as a reward. Everyone's mood is very high, and they are all vying to achieve the plan. Nanliu Village has selected model meritorious persons four times since spring, and the saving mood in the whole village is very good. The model role from top to bottom also plays a great role in carrying out the saving movement. This problem has also been experienced in county and district agencies. (4) Understanding the significance of saving throughout the year. First, this year's harvest is definitely only 50-60%, and the harvest in the western part of the county is even worse. Second, looking at the big picture, there are many areas in the liberated areas that do not have rain. Third, the financial difficulties of the self-defense war. Clarify that saving is for reproduction, and buy agricultural tools, cattle, etc. with the saved things, not saving for the sake of saving.

　　邱县节约备荒经验
    【本报冀南十一日电】邱县县委总结该县节约备荒运动的经验成绩，号召贯澈下去，更好的支援反攻，迎接胜利。
    该总结首先历述了领导上掌握节约备荒的思想变化：自接到区党委节约备荒指示后，县委会明确了节约备荒精神，经过了群众性的思想教育，全县大部村庄形成了节约备荒运动。一开始便号召群众回忆三十二年大灾荒给予人民的痛苦，人民在回忆中提高了节约备荒的情绪。但对怎样节约，感到无办法。于是领导上提出了好干部、积极分子、劳动英雄带头，具体订节约备荒按家计划。如镇东伙王老玉用细粮（麦子）换粗粮，吃一个月省麦三百斤。王万鑫自己采菜，每天每人省粮半斤。古城营某互助队，共十五人，节约计划中光不买颜色一项，就省三万六千元等。行动中也教育了领导，使县委本身对节约更有办法与信心，并提出了表模立功，使运动更进一步。后来普遍落雨，全县下种，秋苗渐渐出齐。有些干部群众认为可以不备荒了，从此松了口气，领导上也随之对节约疏忽，大灾荒的痛苦又逐渐淡漠了。防旱备荒的麻痹思想和秋苗一块生长，直到八月初，估计秋收只有五、六成，又见到报纸上的不少地区没落透雨，领导上再次被提醒了，认为节约备荒必须继续贯澈。
    第二、群众对节约备荒的认识：自从发出节约备荒号召，开始在群众的酝酿讨论中，发现了群众有不少的思想障碍，阻碍了节约运动的开展。马头村干邱书玉说：“刚过了灾荒，不能再有灾荒了。”也有的说：“三十年一大荒，二十年一小荒，刚过了灾荒，不能再有灾荒。没有不下雨的天，下雨晚了，晚苗也不少收，只要收点就够吃。”有的说：“八路军不会叫咱挨饿。三十二年大灾荒，没饿死咱，这会没敌人了，到那里吃不了饭呢？”大家幻想等雨，不愿节约。这些思想障碍，经过一段教育，渐渐得到克服。到了秋苗出齐，又随之忘掉了节约，只看到有了苗，“见苗三分收”的论调又普遍起来，有一点想头也不愿节约，总是靠天靠外援的思想，阻碍着节约运动的开展。
    第三、开展节约运动的基本经验：（一）群众性的思想教育，将节约精神交给群众自己掌握。开始领导上及干部觉着没处着手，但将任务交给群众，经过号召，群众自己酝酿，便出现了办法。这些办法及节约的事实，教育了领导，教育了干部，用这种群众的创造，去更进一步的指导运动深入发展，邱县的节约备荒运动，便是在这种过程中开展起来的。刘云固村干在区村干大会上给别村挑战，南刘村的村干讽刺刘云固村干说：“您村向来都是大吃大喝，咱这一块村数您村腐化，酒铺、饭铺、卖吃的很多”。刘云固村干回村后召开群众会，先讲了天旱不雨和三十二年的灾荒痛苦，又说：“外村都知道咱村好吃，这会咱村可不能再吃了。”群众回忆了大灾荒时各种痛苦，小组进行了讨论，有的说：“省囤头不省囤底，想三十二年早些不省，后来省就晚了。”经过讨论，提出了细粮换粗粮，实行掺糠吃菜，不喝酒、不抽烟不许买着吃，并进行了挑战，提出了互相监视。在群众自己讨论下，想出办法，以后卖酒的没有了，卖吃的没有了。外村有个卖馒头的去刘云固卖馒头，一个老太太因小孩有病拿了一斤麦子去换馒头，走到街上，东看西看，又回去回来，不敢去换。有人问他才说了实话，她说：“都叫省吃俭用哩，换馒头怕人家笑话。”她认识了吃嘴丢人。从这个村教育了干部，只要交给群众，是会有办法的，会形成群众自己的运动。根据这村的经验，领导上提出“回忆三十二年大灾荒，好吃懒作真丢人”的号召，经过回忆，直接推动了群众的节约运动。香城固集上过去喝酒的到处可见，各村回忆后，集上不见喝酒的现象。梁二庄集上三个饭铺，过去每天卖三个大猪，后来连一斤也不卖了。一区区村干部大会上竞赛不吸纸烟，村干回村互相监视，都不敢吸，影响了群众，造成了节约风气。（二）积极分子带头推动运动：古城营邢继修互助队，听到节约，大家回想卅二年的苦，自己订了节约计划：不吸洋烟，自造芝麻叶烟，可省四万六千元，不买颜色，穿灰色衣服，可省十万余元。夏天不穿汗褂子。他队不但影响了本村，并影响了周围村。如城角群众提出向邢继修队学习。四区领导上用邢继修的经验推广了全区。庄头王万鑫自己先采菜，吃了几天，算出了每天每人省米半斤后，再去教育群众，全村形成了采菜运动。四区是以大寨的劳动英雄邢振华节约方法推动全区的：邢振华听了区的节约号召，回本组开会讨论不吸洋烟。给大家算帐，每人每天吸五根洋烟，需洋五十元，一月一千五百元，全年需一万八千元，五个人全年得七万四千元，他并说：“如果三十二年有这些钱，咱五个人不能饿的那样。”全组就具体计划：（１）不吸洋烟、不喝酒（２）不吃麦子换粗粮，省下钱买牛。（３）不买颜色，穿灰色衣服。邢振华说：“我准备好七千元买颜色钱，我也不买了。以这个组的算帐经验，在全村群众大会上宣布后，经过几天，全村群众都自动不吸烟不喝酒了。七个月光洋烟一项能省四十二万元。全村不买颜色用灰色用老鸭爪染布全村能省八十三万四千元。其他又订出细粮换粗粮，婚丧不大吃喝等办法。四区干部研究推广了这个经验。一区用南刘村的节约计划，把王万鑫的采菜推广了全区。这些具体实例及劳英领导办法，从个人模范作用，到全组、全村，全区以至全县，使节约运动普遍开展。（三）表模立功运动保证了节约计划的实现。二区桃寨王殿臣队，自春季节约生产计划到现在。选举了十五次模范，半月或十天选一次，并从副业生产中抽些钱作为奖励，每个人的情绪很高，都是争先恐后的去实现计划。南刘村从春天开始选过四次模范功臣，全村节约情绪很好。自上而下的模范作用对开展节约运动也起着很大作用。在县区机关中也体验到这一问题。（四）认识节约贯澈全年的意义。一、今年肯定只有五六成收，县的西部收成更坏。二、从大处着眼，解放区中不下雨的地区不少。三、自卫战争的财经困难。明确节约是为了再生产，把节约的东西买成农具、耕牛等，不是为单纯节约而节约。
