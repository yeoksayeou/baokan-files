Xinhua News Agency, East China, 31st: Comprehensive report: In September, the military and civilians of Suzhong, on the basis of ensuring the newly restored positions in August, continued to expand their victory, recover large areas of lost territory, and smash the Chiang bandit disturbances in local areas. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 2,704 enemies were killed, wounded, or captured throughout the month, and 40 strongholds were recovered. After suffering heavy blows in August and the transfer of the 49th Division to aid the Northeast, the Chiang bandit army in Suzhong felt deeply that its forces were empty. Therefore, it urgently drew the 59th Brigade of the 4th Division from Huaiyin to Baoying, transferred the 21st Division from Taiwan and the 15th Traffic Police Corps guarding the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway to Tong, Ru, Hai, Qi, and Taixing counties, and reorganized the Tong, Hai, and Qi counties' security teams into the 6th Column of the Provincial Security Team. It re-established the so-called "Tonghaiqi Suppression Command Post" in an attempt to carry out local "suppression." The local military and civilians took the initiative to launch fierce attacks. After the People's Liberation Army captured Baiju, an important town on the Tongyu line, on the 16th, it advanced northwest and recovered Sheyang, the commercial and transportation center of Funing, Xinghua, and Baoying counties, on the 23rd. Then, it swung its troops westward and captured Wangzhigang, the eastern gateway to Baoying city. At the same time, the local armed forces of Chutong (the original town was changed to a county) raided the Sanliwan stronghold west of Dongtai city. The Jiangdu local armed forces advanced more than 30 miles west of the Guanhe River and captured Funong Village in one fell swoop. The enemy troops in Taolin in Baoying, Shagou in Xinghua, and Shen @ in Jiangdu retreated to their cities one after another. The four gates of Baoying city were tightly closed, and martial law was declared; the market in Xinghua city was suffocated, and Chiang's currency could not be used. Our army recovered more than 1,800 square miles of lost territory east of Baoying city, and there were no enemy traces from Gaoyou and Linze in the east to the shore of Sheyang Lake. The military and civilians of Nantong, Haimen, and Qidong persisted in their struggle, making the enemy's "suppression" and "sweeping" operations a complete failure, and ensuring the positions restored in August. The 438th Regiment of the 146th Brigade of the Chiang bandit 21st Division attempted to open the Hai (men) Qi (dong) highway. As soon as it moved out on the 11th, it was immediately caught in the sea of people's guerrilla warfare. It took seven hours to travel six miles from Nanxin Town to Juxing Town in Haimen. The Chiang bandits were disturbed for only six days, but they were met with resistance everywhere and were forced to retreat. At the end of the month, the enemy gathered more than a thousand traffic police and local Chiang bandits and attacked westward from Huilong Town in Qidong. They were repelled by our guerrillas near Hehe Town. In addition, the Chiang bandits, who were driven into the Yangtze River by our August sweeping battle and originally based in Sanhe Town, attempted to make a comeback. When they landed and were about to feast, our guerrillas arrived and gave them a head-on blow, driving them back. To this day, the enemy-occupied areas in Haimen and Qidong counties account for only two-tenths of the total, and the Haiqi Highway is also largely controlled by us. After the local armed forces of Rugao, Taixing, and Jingjiang counties south of the Hai (an) Tai (county) line recovered large areas of territory in August, they continued to penetrate into the Chiang-occupied areas in September, annihilating more than 1,000 enemies, exceeding the total number of enemies annihilated in July and August. A part of the Chiang bandit army's 21st Division was transferred from Nantong to the west to support our newly restored areas in Liangtai, but after being ambushed by us and annihilating a part of it, it shrank into its strongholds and dared not move out. Every time the local Chiang puppets moved out, they painted ghost faces and wore fake beards, fearing that the local masses would recognize them. Their panic and embarrassment can be seen from this.

    苏中一月歼匪近三千
    我军收复据点四十处
    【新华社华东三十一日电】综合报导：九月份苏中军民在确保八月份新恢复阵地基础上，继续扩张胜利，恢复大块失地，并粉碎蒋匪在局部地区的出扰。据不完全统计，全月共毙伤俘敌二千七百零四名，收复据点四十处。苏中蒋匪军于八月遭受惨重打击及整四十九师调援东北后，深感兵力空虚，乃急自淮阴抽调整四师之五十九旅至宝应，调运台湾之整廿一师及守卫京沪铁路之交通警察第十五总队至通、如、海、启、泰兴等县，并改编通、海、启三县保安队为省保安队六纵队，再度成立所谓“通海启清剿指挥所”企图进行局部“清剿”。当地军民机先猛烈出击。解放军一部首于十六日攻克通榆线重镇白驹后，复向西北挺进，于二十三日收复阜（宁）兴（化）宝（应）三县商业交通中心射阳。旋挥戈西指，克宝应城东门户望直港，同时，凑潼（原镇改设县）地武袭入东台城西三里湾据点。江都地武挺进官河以西三十余里，一举攻克富农庄。我军威所至，相继逼退宝应之陶林、兴化之沙沟，江都之沈＠等十二据点，各地蒋记杂伪慌忙缩回城内，宝应城四门紧闭，宣布戒严；兴化城市场窒息，蒋币不能通用。我军于宝应城以东恢复失地一千八百余方里，自高邮、临泽东至射阳湖畔已无敌踪。南通、海门、启东军民坚持斗争，使敌人“清剿”“扫荡”俱归破产，并确保八月恢复之阵地。蒋匪整二十一师一四六旅四三八团企图打通海（门）启（东）公路，于十一日刚一出动，立即陷入人民游击战火海中，从海门南新镇到聚星镇六里路走了七小时。蒋匪出扰仅六天，处处碰壁，被迫收场。月底敌集结交警及土蒋千余人由启东汇龙镇向西出犯，经我游击队在和合镇附近将其击退。另为我八月扫荡战驱入长江飘泊水上原踞三和镇蒋匪，妄图卷土重来，当其登陆正待饱餐时，我游击队赶至，予以迎头痛击，将其逐退。迄今、海门，启东两县全境敌占区仅及十分之二，海启公路亦大部为我控制。海（安）泰（县）线以南如（皋）泰（兴）泰（县）靖（江）四县各级地武于八月恢复大块阵地后，九月继续深入蒋占区作战，歼敌千余，超过七、八两月歼敌数之总和。蒋匪军整廿一师一部，由南通远道西援向两泰我新恢复区反扑，经我伏击，歼其一部后，缩进据点，不敢出动。土著蒋伪每次出动时，多涂成鬼脸，戴上假须，害怕当地群众认清面目，其惶恐狼狈，于此可见。
