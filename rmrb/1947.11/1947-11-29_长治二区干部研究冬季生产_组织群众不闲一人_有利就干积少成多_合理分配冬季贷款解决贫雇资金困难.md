[Report from our newspaper in Changzhi] After the conscription work in the Second District was completed, a meeting of district cadres was held on the 15th of this month to discuss how to shift the enthusiasm of the masses from the "three搶" (搶收, 搶種, 搶管 - rush to harvest, rush to plant, rush to manage) to winter production. After repeated research, everyone discovered and clarified the following issues:

I. Several ideological problems that must be solved. Due to old habits from the past, many masses have a winter idleness mentality. For example, the masses in Shenjiazhuang said: "Suffer for a summer, idle for a winter. We're exhausted from the autumn harvest and wheat autumn plowing, shouldn't we rest a bit?" Some said: "In winter, hands and feet are cold, except for pulling a few carts of coal, we should rest." In hemp-producing areas such as Gaohe and Xinyi, regardless of men or women, they take some hemp and wander from door to door, taking advantage of the warmth to sit idly. Women in Su Dian do odd jobs, men haul coal, and every few days they carry a load of cabbage to sell. Most of these odd jobs and cabbages are sold and spent in small amounts, used as small side dishes. Some mutual aid teams have already settled their work and are preparing to disband and end production. Secondly, some masses are also willing to engage in production, but they look down on small profits and only want to make big money. For example, the vice village chief of Tianhe said: "What's the use of a small cooperative earning three walnuts and two dates? It's better to open a business in the city and make big money." The masses in Nandong reflected: "Without livestock, we can't engage in transportation. People are useless, and we lack capital. We need to borrow tens of thousands of yuan for loans, and if it's less, they'll say it's not enough. How can this little money be of any use?" So they don't go into transportation. Thirdly, they don't plan for the long term, don't think of a steady stream, and only care about the present. Some masses "eat up the entire autumn harvest, are poor for a summer, and rich for a winter," arbitrarily wasting resources. Many masses in Su Dian constantly eat and drink in mutton soup shops. Some have eaten and drunk tens of thousands of yuan from summer until now. For example, some go to the city to sell a load of cabbage and also go to restaurants. In Xinyi and Yuanjiazhuang, some masses take a few pounds of hemp to the city every few days, not only go to restaurants, but also go to theaters to watch plays and buy smoking paper, etc. These ideological problems must be addressed by summarizing the year's production, inspecting "cultivating three and saving one," publicizing current affairs, and digging up old roots to improve the masses' awareness. They must recognize the power of organization, and in a year of poor harvests, to achieve prosperity through "cultivating three and saving one," supporting the front and preventing famine, on the one hand, we must establish the masses' idea of small profits and quick sales, accumulating small gains, and doing anything profitable to vigorously develop winter production to compensate for the poor harvest. On the other hand, we must educate the masses to plan for the long term, maintain a steady stream, tighten expenses, and ban waste. The slogan is: "If the jar opening is frugal, there will be surplus grain; if the jar bottom is frugal, there will be famine. You can't get through disaster if you don't eat chaff; you can't eat quickly if you don't eat vegetables."

    Rectify Mutual Aid, Transform Leadership

II. Rectify mutual aid teams and integrate mutual aid into winter production. In some mutual aid teams, the leadership is not in the hands of the poor and hired peasants, and some are even still controlled by rich peasants. They deliberately seek to ingratiate themselves with the masses, evade struggles, deliberately emphasize tolerance, do not discount work equally, do not use work tickets, and do not deeply lead (nor is it possible), so that the mutual aid teams cannot play their due role. Some, due to continuous blitzes of the autumn harvest, wheat autumn plowing, have also failed to implement equal discounts, work calculations, and the issuance of work tickets, and some have not even settled accounts for a year, which has also affected the consolidation of mutual aid teams. For example, Jin Guosheng's team in Sima Village has not cleared accounts since spring, nor has it used work tickets. It has only kept a messy account intermittently, so there is no way to settle accounts now. Confusedly, it was called on to pay Fasheng eighty pounds of wages rice. Fasheng said: "I'll pay six pounds of rice for an adult's work, and I'll also pay six pounds of rice for a child's work. If it's going to be confused, I'll only pay forty pounds." As a result, the payment that should be made is not made, and those who earn wages insist on it, directly leading to the final collapse of the mutual aid team. In villages such as Jiazhang, someone uses the collectively raised livestock, but no one feeds them. Everyone complains that others use them more. Households with livestock are unwilling to help households without livestock, and households with labor are unwilling to help households without labor. This phenomenon is relatively common. If it is not resolved as soon as possible, not only will winter production not be successful, but also next year's mutual aid production will become a problem. Therefore, we must deeply inspect mutual aid, resolutely transform leadership, and truly grasp the leadership of the mutual aid teams in the hands of the poor and hired peasants, and resolutely and thoroughly eliminate the outstanding problems of the mutual aid teams over the past year, so that the mutual aid teams can be truly consolidated and developed under the principles of voluntary association, equal discount, and labor-capital profit sharing.

    Mobilize the Masses to Inspect and Rectify Cooperatives to Become the Core of Winter Production

III. Rectify cooperatives so that they truly become the core of organizing winter production. Many cooperatives are still controlled by rich peasants and landlords. They use direct sales of small profits to麻醉 (mazui - anesthetize) the masses, buy off cadres and activists. Some cadres, for their own convenience in overdrafting and borrowing, are satisfied with the landlord's technology, making the cooperatives a shelter for the landlords, detached from the masses, and some even nominally serve the masses, but in reality, preserve and develop the property of the landlords. For example, Li Rixin of Guxian was still the manager of the Handan branch after being struggled against. The masses' shares were more than one million yuan, and he himself secretly concealed more than one million yuan in shares. His younger brother was also the manager of the Yincheng branch. The masses reflected: "These landlords are ostensibly struggled against, but in reality, they are still sitting in the cooperatives, flaunting their power and looking down on us poor people." Some cooperatives have unclear directions and do not organize mass production, taking a purely profit-seeking viewpoint. For example, the Shanghao Cooperative only sells small items and cosmetics, and does not even buy cotton on behalf of the masses, let alone organize mass production. The Nanliang Cooperative bought cotton and hid it, only selling it to the masses after the price rose. The Su Dian Cooperative has not settled accounts for three years, nor has it distributed dividends. Originally, it had 500,000 yuan, but the masses' overdrafts alone amounted to 1.5 million yuan. The cooperative complained that the masses did not pay back their debts, and the masses reflected that the cooperative did not distribute dividends and only knew how to card people. In addition, there is a great imbalance in loans between villages. Of the more than five million yuan in the entire district, Tianhe, Gaohe, and Ancheng alone accounted for more than two million yuan, and most of these loans were given to middle peasant or higher households. Poor villages such as Huili and Langjia did not receive a single penny, so the loans did not play a role in supporting the production of the poor and hired peasants. If these problems are not dealt with in a timely manner, winter production will be weak, and the difficulties of the poor and hired peasants will increase. Therefore, we must develop mass inspections of cooperatives, and cooperatives must universally clear accounts and distribute dividends. Through inspection, the poor and hired peasants will take power, clarify that cooperatives are for the service of the masses, and truly become the core of organizing mass winter production, so as to achieve the mutual benefit of the masses and cooperatives. The masses' overdrafts should be quickly cleared through the organization of mass production income, and should not form a simple debt collection; in wealthy villages with many loans, a portion should be recovered and re-loaned to poor villages, and the masses' floating capital should be organized on a large scale, and credit and loan societies should be improved and developed. Loans must be given to poor villages and poor and hired peasants, and it must be guaranteed that all of them are used in winter production.

    Textile and Transportation are the Main Focus, Organize Large-Scale Fertilizer Accumulation

IV. Sideline occupations combined with fertilizer accumulation are the production direction for this winter. The content of winter production should focus on textile and transportation and other sideline production, combined with fertilizer accumulation. In textiles, spinning should focus on improving technology, and continue to develop spinning women and weaving women. We must mobilize skilled workers to take apprentices, so that quantity and quality advance simultaneously. This winter, we must start all the machines and ensure that people stop but machines don't. The cooperative must be responsible for purchasing raw materials, promoting finished products, and helping the textile group calculate accounts and distribute dividends immediately. In terms of transportation, we should organize livestock to haul goods as much as possible. Generally, livestock should focus on selling coal, combined with other small living items. Breaking with the old habits of the past, we must organize a large number of shoulder pole transports. We must require that textile and transportation solve the problem of winter clothing, and ensure that not a single grain is sold. In hemp-producing areas, we must mobilize the old, young, orphans, and widows to systematically peel hemp, turn hemp into production funds, or purchase grain, prevent piecemeal eating of small side dishes, organize exports, and exchange for grain and raw materials. And pay attention to repairing roads and renovating roadside shops, etc., according to the specific conditions of each village, give full play to everyone's production specialties, do what you can do, do what you know how to do, do what makes money, and ensure that no one is idle. In addition, we must organize large-scale fertilizer accumulation to lay the foundation for more grain production next year. In terms of fertilizer accumulation methods: (1) Combine burning ash and universally smoke tiger holes; (2) Dig up old graves and dig up turf to accumulate fertilizer; (3) Mobilize women and children to sweep courtyards, sweep road soil, and dig pond soil; (4) Use sideline income to buy "@" manure from the city and organize oil mills in large numbers to make more oil cakes; (5) Mobilize old men and children to carry manure early and late, and those who sell cabbage or coal should bring back manure on the way home to ensure that they don't go home empty-handed. Regardless of sideline production or fertilizer accumulation, we must accept past experience in solving past outstanding problems, open up the masses' thinking, and truly fully mobilize the entire semi-auxiliary labor force.

　　长治二区干部研究冬季生产
  　组织群众不闲一人
    有利就干积少成多
    合理分配冬季贷款解决贫雇资金困难
    【本报长治讯】二区参军工作完成后，于本月十五日召开区干部会议，讨论如何把群众三抢中的热劲，转向冬季生产，经大家反复的研究，发现与明确了以下的几个问题：
    一、必须解决的几个思想问题。因历史上的旧习惯，不少群众存在着冬闲思想，如申家庄群众说：“受一夏，闲一冬。秋收赶麦秋耕忙坏啦，还不该歇一歇哩。”有的说：“到冬天手冻脚冷哩，除过拉几车煤就该休息哩。”在高河、信义等产麻区，不管男女取上些麻游门串户趁暖闲坐。苏店妇女做零活，男人弄煤，隔几天挑担白菜去卖，这些零活与白菜，大部是零卖零花，零星配吃了小菜，有些互助组现已清工算帐，准备解散结束生产。其次，有些群众也愿意搞生产，但是看不起小利，光想发大财。如天河副村长说：小型合作社赚上三核桃两枣顶个啥用，还是到城内开上一座买卖能抓大钱。”南董群众反映：没牲口不能搞运输，人不顶事，又少本钱，贷款要贷几万元，少了就会说不行，这几个钱还能顶个事，就不去运输了。再次，不长期打算，不细水长流，只顾眼前，有的群众“收不收吃一秋，穷一夏富一冬”的任意浪费。苏店不少群众不断到羊汤铺吃喝，有的从夏天到现在吃喝到几万元，如有的到城里去卖担白菜也要下馆子。信义、原家庄有的群众，不隔几天就要取上几斤麻进城，不但下馆子，还要到戏院看看戏，买吸纸烟等等。这些思想问题，必须在总结全年生产，检查耕三余一，宣传时事，刨老根中提高群众，使群众认识组织起来的力量，和歉收的年景，要做到耕三余一发家致富，支前防荒，一方面必须树立群众薄利广销、积少成多、有利就干的思想，大量开展冬季生产补救歉收。另方面教育群众长期打算，细水长流，紧缩开支，禁绝浪费，口号是：“缸口省有余粮，缸底省受饥荒，不吃糠不能渡灾荒，不吃菜粮食吃的快。”
    　　　　整顿互助改造领导
    二、整顿互助组，把互助贯澈到冬季生产中。有的互助组因领导权没掌握在贫雇手里，甚至有的仍被富农所掌握，他们为买弄群众，逃躲斗争，故意讲求涵厚，不折工等价，不使用工票，更不深入领导（也不可能），以致互助组起不了应有作用，有的因秋收赶麦秋耕的连续突击，也没有把等价折工计工随发工票清工贯澈下去，甚至有的一年未结算过帐，也影响到互助组的巩固。如司马村靳果胜组，自春天到现在帐未清理过，也未使用工票，只断断续续的记了个乱帐，所以到现在没法结算，糊里糊涂叫发胜出八十斤工资米，发胜说：“大人一工出六斤米，小孩我也给他出六斤米，如要糊涂，我只出四十斤。”结果闹的该出不出，赚工资者非要不行，直闹到互助组最后垮台。贾掌等村伙喂的牲口，有人使没人喂，谁也嫌别人使的多，有牲口户不愿和没牲口户互助，有劳力户不愿和没劳力户互助。这种现象比较普遍，如不及早解决，不但冬季生产搞不好，就是明年的互助生产也会成问题，所以必须深入检查互助，坚决改造领导，把互助组的领导权真正掌握到贫雇手里，并把一年来互助组存在的遗留问题坚决彻底来个一扫光，使互助组真正在自愿结合等价折工劳资分红的原则下巩固与发展。
    　　　　发动群众检查整顿合作社成为冬季生产核心
    三、整顿合作社，使合作社真正成为组织冬季生产的核心。不少合作社仍掌握在富农与地主手里，他们以直营小利麻醉群众，收买干部、积极分子，部分干部为了自己赊欠、借贷方便，就满足于地主技术，使合作社成了地主的防空洞，脱离了群众，甚至有的名为群众服务，实为保存和发展地主的财产。如故县李日新被斗后，仍在邯郸分社任经理，群众股金一百多万元，他自己暗藏的股金也有一百多万元，他弟又在荫城分社任经理。群众反映：这些地主，面上被斗争，实在还是坐在合作社耀武扬威，看不起咱们穷人。有的合作社方向不明，不组织群众生产，是单纯的营利观点。如上郝合作社，只卖零食物品与化装品，就连棉花也不给群众代买，更谈不到组织群众生产了。南量合作社买到棉花藏起来，等涨价后才卖给群众。苏店合作社三年没结算过帐，也没分过红利，原本五十万元，光群众赊帐就到一百五十万元，合作社怨群众不还帐，群众反映合作社不分红，光会卡人。另外，在贷款上村与村极不平衡，全区五百多万元，天河、高河、安城三个村就占了二百多万元，而且这些款大部是贷到中农以上成份手里。象会里、郎家等穷村，并没有贷到一块钱，所以贷款没有起到扶植贫雇生产的作用。这些问题如不及时处理，冬季生产就会无力，贫雇困难就会更多，因此必须发展群众检查合作社，合作社要普遍的清帐分红。通过检查，使贫雇当权，明确合作社是为群众服务，真正成为组织群众冬季生产的核心，以得到群众与合作社的两利发展。群众赊欠，应以组织群众生产收入很快清理，不能形成单纯要帐；在贷款多的富村，收回一部转贷给穷村，并大量组织群众游资，健全与发展信用借贷社，必须贷到穷村与贫雇手里，并保证全部用在冬季生产中。
    　　　　纺织运输为主组织大量积肥
    四、副业为主结合积肥为今冬的生产方向。冬季生产的内容，应以纺织运输及其他副业生产为主，结合积肥。在纺织上，纺花以提高技术为主，继续发展纺妇织妇，要动员成手带徒弟，使量与质同时并进，在今冬要把机子全部开动起来，做到人停机不停。合作社必须负责购买原料，推销成品，帮助纺织组即时算帐分红。在运输方面，尽量的组织好牲口拉脚，一般牲口以卖煤炭为主，结合其他零碎生活。打破过去的老习惯，大量组织担挑运输，要求以纺织运输解决冬季穿衣问题，保证不卖一棵粮。在产麻区，要发动老幼孤寡有组织的进行剥麻，把麻变成生产资金，或购买粮食，防止零星配吃小菜，组织出口，换回粮食和原料来。并注意修筑道路改造沿路店房等，根据各村具体情况，发挥每个人的生产特长，能干啥干啥，会干啥干啥，啥赚钱干啥，保证不闲一个人。另外，必须组织大量积肥，给明年多打粮打下基础。在积肥办法上：（一）结合烧灰，普遍熏老虎洞；（二）刨古坟刨草皮积肥；（三）动员妇女儿童扫院扫道土挖池土；（四）以副业收入，到城里去买＠粪，大量组织油坊，多打油饼；（五）发动老汉儿童起早搭黑抬粪，卖白菜或卖煤炭的回家时要捎带拾粪，保证不空回家。不管副业生产或是积肥，必须接受过去经验在解决过去遗留问题上，打通群众思想，真正把全半辅劳力充分发动起来。（振华、黎明、二区通讯组）
