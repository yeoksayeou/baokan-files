　　JiaoZuo Second District's Experience in Protecting Ding and Defending Grain
　　Overcoming Complacency, Constant Preparedness
　　Combining Landmines and Rifles for Mutual Support

　　[Report from this newspaper, JiaoZuo] The Second District, during the struggle to protect Ding and defend grain on November 2nd, combined landmines and rifles to defeat the invasion of over a thousand bandits led by Wang Fengying, annihilating 43 of them. The experiences that led to this glorious victory are as follows: (1) Overcoming complacency and seizing the opportunity to hide grain. Initially, the masses were busy planting wheat and harvesting persimmons, believing that the old grain was well-hidden and hadn't been stolen for a long time, and that the new grain was not much, so they relaxed their efforts in hiding grain. After mobilization, the masses realized that if the grain was eaten by the enemy, they would come to attack us. So the entire district mobilized and organized all forces to rush to hide the grain. When the enemy came, they couldn't find any grain and only took away the corn husks, bran, rags, and broken socks from Da Ao. (2) Universally deploy explosives, constantly study the enemy's patterns, and change the minefields accordingly. Before this enemy disturbance, small groups of enemies came out every day for three or four days. The district headquarters estimated that the enemy was going to launch a major grain grab, so it immediately convened a meeting of all armed cadres in the district, studied the enemy's intentions, and arranged minefields in every village, placing mines on the enemy's retreat routes and on the items they wanted to steal. Each village laid landmines overnight. Before dawn, the enemy came swaggering in, right into the new mines, suffering heavy casualties. Wherever the enemy went, there was an explosion. Whatever they tried to steal exploded, and every village had explosions, making the enemy scared and afraid to advance, and forced to flee in panic. The enemy fell into minefields in Suijing and Longdong. One enemy was shouting to others, "I dare not go forward, look for landmines!" Before he could finish speaking, he stepped on a landmine under his own feet. (3) Combine cold shots to force the enemy onto the mines, shooting when they are detonated, and shooting even when they aren't detonated, seeking more opportunities to kill and wound the enemy. As the enemy was approaching the mines in Suijing, the Gu Lu militia immediately fired a shot. The enemy ran forward, and with a "boom," he fell down. Seeing the enemy enter the minefield, the Dongzhangzhuang militia, led by Comrade Fazhang, shouted one, two, and fired a volley. The enemy panicked and scurried around, setting off two landmines in a row. The militia heard the enemy shout in the distance, "Come quickly, Battalion Commander Wang's leg is broken." The close combination of explosions and cold shots greatly increased the casualties, and the enemy was very afraid. The masses of Dongzhangzhuang said, "The enemy can only look up, not down." (4) Joint defense and mutual support. The Central Joint Defense first discovered the enemy. Comrade Jin Liu led the militia, fighting and retreating. The Tainan Detachment quickly came to support. Seeing the support, the Suijing militia took the initiative to counterattack and charged down. When the fighting became more intense, the militias from Zhoumi, Shierhui, and other villages also arrived, all charging towards Da Ao Ridge. The enemy began to retreat and flee along the way. The Mutantai militia guerrilla of the East Joint Defense also launched an attack. The firepower of the militias from each village gradually concentrated, and with the sound of the horn, the sound of killing rose everywhere. The frightened enemy fled back, the formation was chaotic, the landmines exploded, and the enemy dropped cloth bags, shoes, rags, and other things on the retreat.

　　焦作二区保丁护粮歼敌经验
  　克服麻痹经常备战
    雷枪结合互相支援
    【本报焦作讯】二区于十一月二日保丁护粮斗争中，雷枪结合，打垮土匪王凤英千余人的进犯，并歼灭其四十三人，获得此次辉煌胜利的经验如下：（一）克服麻痹思想，抓紧藏粮。开始，群众都忙着先种麦打红柿，认为旧粮藏的好，多时没抢走，新粮论数不多，放松了藏粮。经过动员，群众认识到粮食若叫敌人吃了，就要来打咱们。于是全区动员，组织全力突击藏粮。敌人来了找不到粮食，只把大凹的玉茭皮、糠、破布烂袜拿走了。（二）普遍展开爆炸，经常研究敌人规律，适时改换雷阵。这次敌人出扰，前三、四天小股敌人每天出来活动，区指挥部估计到敌人要来大抢粮，就立即召集了全区武装干部会议，研究了敌人的心思，村村布置雷区，在敌人的退路上与要抢的东西上都按了雷，各村都连夜埋设了地雷，天未明，敌人摇摇摆摆的就来了，恰恰中上新雷，杀伤很大。敌人到那里，那里就炸，抢啥啥就响，村村有爆炸，使敌人进退都挨炸，胆战心惊，不敢前进，狼狈逃窜。敌人在粟井、龙洞都陷入了雷阵，一个敌人正喊叫别人：“不敢往前走了，看有地雷！”还没有等他把话说完，就踏响了他自己脚底下的地雷。（三）结合冷枪，逼敌上雷，遇炸就打，不炸也打，多寻找杀伤敌人的机会。敌人在粟井快走进雷前，谷碌民兵马上放了一枪，敌人往前一跑，轰的一声就倒下去了。东张庄民兵正看到敌人走进雷区，法章同志喊了一二，打了排枪，敌人着慌乱窜，连着踏响了两个地雷，民兵远远听到敌人喊叫说：“快来，王排长腿崩坏了。”爆炸与冷枪密切结合，杀伤力大，敌人很害怕，东张庄群众说：“敌人顾了上边顾不了下边。”（四）联防作战，互相支援。中联防先发觉敌人，靳六同志带领民兵边打边退，太南支队迅速赶来支援，粟井民兵看见有了支援，就先发动反击，冲下去了。打的更凶时，周密、十二会等村的民兵也都赶到了，一齐冲向大凹岭，敌人一路开始退却逃跑。东联防毋三太民兵游击队也发起了冲锋。各村民兵的火力都逐渐集中起来了，号声一响，杀声四起。吓的敌人就往回跑窜，阵营混乱，轰轰的地雷响了，敌人在退路上丢下了布袋、鞋子、破布片等东西。
