    Lin County's Tenth District Deeply Rectifies Finances
    Returns Most of the Captured Fruits After Utilization
    [This newspaper's Lin County dispatch] Lin County's Fifth District, in the process of rectifying its finances, thoroughly implemented ideological leadership and paid attention to mobilizing the masses to carry out the rectification. With few district cadres, they utilized and leveraged the strength of village cadres, organized temporary inspection teams, and promoted the work of the entire district. Following the previous rectification which yielded 16 million yuan, earning commendation from the Special Commissioner's Office, the Tenth District, in the deepening phase, rectified an additional 17 million yuan (converted value of dead assets). Out of 58 administrative villages in the district, 55 villages could be self-sufficient with surplus in the second half of the year, and 3 villages were semi-self-sufficient. They found avenues for production, and most villages returned the fruits of struggle that had been captured in the past. The source of these achievements is, first and foremost, the leadership's clear understanding of the importance of financial rectification. The Tenth District Party Committee Secretary stated at the district cadre meeting: "Whoever does not pay attention to financial rectification has a weak concept of the poor and hired peasants." Regarding combining financial rectification with central work, District Head Gu proposed: "Three major tasks combined, advancing simultaneously" (financial rectification, production, and burden). At the county finance meeting on October 14th, everyone unanimously agreed that the leadership of the two districts followed the mass line. The county government specifically issued a commendation order and recorded a merit on their record of service. (Guangzhi)
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 3rd dispatch] In Lin County, Taihang District, 532 villages cleared out public and collective property worth a total of 249.3 million yuan during the rectification of local finances. The cleared-out public grain and funds are sufficient to feed 500 cadres in the county for two and a half years. Currently, village financial management committees have been universally established in the county, establishing a unified expenditure and strict management system. Furthermore, a new financial policy of everyone being responsible, combining production and assisting the poor and hired peasants has been proposed. The rectified assets are handed over to village mutual aid organizations to support agricultural and sideline production, and to enable village finances to achieve self-sufficiency through production. Over eighty villages in the county have already achieved self-sufficiency through production. The success of this financial rectification is mainly due to the mobilization of the masses. The leadership mobilized the self-reporting of concealed public property and funds, and called on cadres to set an example. At the same time, in-depth investigations were carried out, proposing "Don't be afraid of many minds, you can't keep up with the many eyes of the masses." This enabled the movement to be completed quickly.

    林县十区深入整财
    抓用果实大部退还
    【本报林县讯】林县五区在整理财政中，贯澈了思想领导，注意发动群众进行整财。在区干部少的情况下，运用与发挥了村干部的力量，组织了临时检查组，推动了全区的工作。十区继上次整出资金一千六百万元，获得专署通报表扬后，在深入阶段，又整出死财折价一千七百余万元，全区五十八个行政村，有五十五个村在后半年可自给有余，三个村半自给，找出了生产门路，大部分村庄退还了过去抓用的斗争果实。这些成绩的来源，首先是领导上明确整财的重要意义，十区分委书记在区干部会议上提出：“谁不注意整理财政，就是贫雇观念不强。”在结合中心工作完成整理财政上，谷区长提出：“三大结合，齐头并进”（整财、生产、负担）。十月十四日全县财政会议上，大家一致认为该两区的领导走了群众路线，县府特通令表扬。并在功劳簿上记功一次。（广智）
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫三日电】太行区林县，五百三十二村，在整理地方财政中，清出公物、社物共值二亿四千九百三十万余元，清理出之公粮公款等足供该县五百干部两年半之食用。现该县各村已普遍建立了村财政管委会，确立了统一开支严格管理制度。并提出大家负责，结合生产与扶助贫雇的新财政方针。将整理出之财物，交村中互助组织，扶植农副生产，并使村财政作到生产自给。全县已有八十余村作到生产自给。此次整理财政成功，主要由于发动了群众，领导上发动自报隐瞒之公物、公财，并号召干部以身作则。同时又深入查挤，提出“不怕你心多，赶不上群众眼多”。因而使运动得以迅速完成。
