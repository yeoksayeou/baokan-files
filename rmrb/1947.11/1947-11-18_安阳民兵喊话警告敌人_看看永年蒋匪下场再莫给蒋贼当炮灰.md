(This report comes from Taihang on the 15th) The Anyang region is launching a mass movement against grain seizure and forced conscription, striking behind enemy lines, extensively carrying out political offensives, and suppressing traitorous landlords and "secret societies." In the past month, 140 enemies have been killed, wounded, or captured. On the night of October 31st, the Eighth District militia penetrated Song Village and encountered an enemy "secret society" chanting incantations. We captured 18 of them alive. Furthermore, in coordination with the Sixth District militia of Ye County, they stormed into Thirty Mile Village in six directions, killing and wounding four enemies and capturing four. The County Military Special Detachment issued a commendation order. The Ninth District militia, in coordination with the Sixth District militia of Ye County, raided Ma Village and captured eleven traitorous landlords, causing extreme panic among enemy agents and puppets. During the political offensive, Guo Erwa's team publicized in Walnut Tree Village, "Young men should avoid conscription and escape to the liberated areas, not be cannon fodder for Chiang Kai-shek!" They also captured bad landlords such as Cui Jinsheng, a total of 28 people. The entire district distributed more than 300 propaganda leaflets overnight and shouted warnings to the enemy in Anyang: "Look at the fate of the Chiang bandits in Yongnian, joining secret societies is just dying for Chiang Kai-shek!" The bandits, puppets, and masses listened quietly. The political offensive model team, Zhang Youwu's team, has held 13 mass meetings behind enemy lines in the past month, with the participation of 1,500 people. They posted 162 propaganda posters in 13 villages and led the masses of Village X to divide more than 30 mu of vegetable plots, initially awakening the masses, who said, "If you lead us, we dare to do it!"

[Another report] Zhang Youwu's team in the Fifth District of Anyang penetrated into Xiaoming Village and other villages on October 20th, holding mass meetings to publicize the news of the great counter-offensive. The masses were extremely excited and voluntarily handed over nine large carts of public grain. On the 21st, the enemy set out for Xinzhuang. Enemy soldiers saw the propaganda posters posted by our Zhang Youwu's team, tore down six from the wall, and said, "This time we have to take a good look, and we can't let the officials see it." On the night of the 25th, a battalion of the enemy's 317th Regiment and the township government launched a sneak attack on our firewood depot in Liang Village. Zhang Youwu's team also launched a night attack and encountered the enemy west of the firewood depot, killing and wounding ten enemies in cooperation with Unit 52x.
