Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 30th: Late-arriving news: On the 10th, a regiment of local Chiang bandits from Yuanshi suddenly surrounded Dakong Village in our border area, attempting to eliminate the Dakong and Nansu village militias stationed there. The twenty-odd militiamen from the two villages defended their bunkers resolutely, engaging in fierce fighting from dawn until 1 PM. The enemy's repeated assaults were unsuccessful. Finally, under the cover of intense artillery fire, the enemy approached the bunkers by holding wet cotton blankets on top of square tables, destroying the militia's fortifications. The militiamen then retreated into tunnels to continue their resistance. In the evening, a certain local armed unit of ours arrived and attacked the enemy from both inside and outside, routing them. The next day, over a thousand of these enemies surrounded Wangsong Village, but they were also repelled by the militia in coordination with a certain unit of our local forces. In both battles, over thirty enemies were killed or wounded, while we suffered no casualties. The militias of Dakong and Wangsong villages have repeatedly defeated Chiang bandit troops attempting to loot grain, and they are known as "border fortresses," considered thorns in the side of the Chiang bandits.

[This newspaper report] The stubborn army and puppet Da Xiang entrenched in Sijiazhuang, the third district of Huolu, have been looting grain from the masses and forcing them to build fortifications and blockhouses, preventing them from harvesting autumn crops and sowing wheat. The masses have been longing for our army to come and rescue them. Our militia and work teams, in coordination with a part of the main force, launched an attack on Sijiazhuang at dawn on October 20th. The puppet Da Xiang fled upon hearing the news. Later, a unit of stubborn troops arrived from Yongbi, but our army fought bravely and gave the enemy a head-on blow, repelling them. Ten were captured alive, and over thirty were killed or wounded (including Cao Shengyuan, the leader of the puppet Self-Defense Force's Third Squad). We seized three machine gun barrels, thirteen rifles, two Mauser pistols, and over two thousand rounds of ammunition. Our army immediately recovered Sijiazhuang. When the masses saw their loved ones arrive, they automatically boiled water and cooked food, and they all told us of their grievances. They also burned down the enemy's blockhouses and demolished all the fortifications. A struggle to distribute clothes and grain is now underway.

[This newspaper report] The militia armed turn-over team in the fourth district of Taigu created a model battle record of zero to fifteen, capturing the enemy's battalion instructor and thirteen others, and seizing two machine guns and twelve rifles.

The 37th Division stationed in Qixian gathered three battalions of troops on October 18th to invade Shantai Village in the fourth district of Taigu, looting a large amount of grain. This was discovered by the 40th Regiment of our Second Military Sub-district and the armed turn-over team of the fourth district militia, who immediately launched a counterattack, fighting fiercely for five hours and repelling the enemy. In one battle, the director of the W委会 of Hujiazhuang in the fourth district captured an enemy battalion instructor. Our side suffered no casualties.

The next day, two battalions with over five hundred troops of the Niu Regiment of the Yan Xishan's Ninth Column, stationed in Taigu City, went to Pangcun, Jingshen, Shantai, Podi and other villages in the fourth district to loot grain. Upon arriving at Pangcun, they stepped on three landmines buried by the armed militia turn-over team of the fourth district (the number of enemy killed or wounded is unknown). They were repelled by the 40th Regiment of our Second Military Sub-district and the armed militia turn-over team of the fourth district. Our armed militia turn-over team alone killed two enemy soldiers, including a squad leader, and captured twelve enemy soldiers, seized two machine guns, twelve rifles, over a thousand rounds of ammunition, fifteen grenades, five coats, three cotton-padded clothes, six helmets, and five bayonets.

    【本报讯】太谷四区民兵武装翻身队创零比十五的模范战例，俘敌营指导员等以下十三名，缴获机枪二挺，步枪十二支。
