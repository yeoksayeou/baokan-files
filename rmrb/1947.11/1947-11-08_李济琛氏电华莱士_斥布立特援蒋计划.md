Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: Associated Press, Hong Kong, 4th: Li Jishen recently cabled the Democratic Far East Policy Committee and Wallace in Washington, calling for a joint effort to stop American imperialism's ambition to aid Chiang in destroying China and conquering the world. The telegram denounced Bullitt's loan to aid Chiang's construction as "clearly attempting to reduce China to a colony of the United States and an anti-Soviet base, thereby using China's 450 million people, under the joint supreme emperor MacArthur, to conduct an anti-Soviet war together with Japan and South Korea, in order to advance the American plan to conquer the world."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: The U.S. government is providing another $27 million in supplies to aid Chiang in the civil war. According to the U.S. Information Service: The U.S. State Department announced on the 4th that, in accordance with the recently signed Chiang-U.S. "Relief Agreement," the United States will send $27.7 million worth of so-called "urgent relief supplies" to the Chiang Kai-shek government. The shipment of supplies will begin around the end of November.

    斥布立特援蒋计划
    【新华社陕北六日电】美联社香港四日讯：李济琛顷致电华盛顿民主远东政策委员会及华莱士，呼吁共同努力制止美帝国主义援蒋亡华征服世界野心。电文中指斥布立特贷款援蒋建设“显然是力图降中国为美国的殖民地与反苏基地，从而利用中国的四万万五千万人民，在共同太上皇麦克阿瑟下，与日本、南韩共同进行反苏战争，以推进美国征服世界计划”。
    【新华社陕北六日电】美政府又以二千七百万元物资援蒋内战。据美国新闻处消息：美国务院四日宣布，根据最近签订之蒋美“救济协定”，美国将以二千七百七十万美元的所谓“急需救济物资”，送给蒋介石政府。物资之运送十一月底前后即予开始。
