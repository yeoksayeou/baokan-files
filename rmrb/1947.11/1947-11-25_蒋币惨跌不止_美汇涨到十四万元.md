Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd. Combined reports from Reuters and Associated Press: As the Jiang bandit puppet election began on the 21st, "when Shanghai's streets sounded air raid sirens as signals, the 'legal tender' presented another spectacular collapse," symbolizing the political bankruptcy of the Jiang bandit regime. On that day, when the Shanghai market opened, the US dollar was at 119,000 Jiang currency, but by closing, it had skyrocketed to around 140,000 Jiang currency per US dollar. Compared to late January of this year, it has already increased by 20 times. On this day, Shanghai stocks all rose to "possible heights," and the stock exchange has announced a suspension of trading. The sharp devaluation of the Jiang currency is clearly directly related to the military defeats of the Jiang bandits, and its "astonishing rise can be attributed to the large amount of floating capital fleeing from North China to Shanghai." At the same time, the US dollar in Hong Kong has experienced a "horrifying surge" because a large amount of Jiang currency is fleeing from Shanghai to Hong Kong, causing US dollar holders to distrust the Jiang currency. The Jiang bandit authorities are helpless in the face of the Jiang currency's rapid decline. On the 21st, Zhang Qun, speaking at the Jiang bandit's National Economic Commission in Nanjing, could only repeat his so-called "there is no reason to change the current foreign exchange policy," but the black market exchange rate has already exceeded the Jiang bandit's official price by more than double.

### 蒋币惨跌不止　美汇涨到十四万元

　　蒋币惨跌不止
  　美汇涨到十四万元
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】综合路透、美联社消息：当二十一日蒋匪伪选开始，“上海各街道响叫着警笛作为信号的时候，‘法币’又呈现了一次奇观式的崩溃”，象征着蒋匪统治的政治破产。是日沪市美钞开盘时为蒋币十一万九千元，收盘时已暴涨至十四万元左右换一美元。较之今年一月下旬已涨达廿倍。这一天，上海股票均涨至“可能的高度”，证券交易所已宣布停止买卖。蒋币之猛烈贬值，显与蒋匪之军事失败直接有关，其“惊人的上涨，可归因于大量游资由华北逃来上海。”同时香港美汇已发生“骇人听闻之暴涨”，因大量蒋币正自上海逃至香港，致使美钞持有者对蒋币不敢信任。蒋匪当局对蒋币的急泻直下，束手无策，二十一日张群在南京蒋匪全国经济委员会发言中仅能重复其所谓“现行外汇政策没有任何改变的理由”之烂调，但黑市汇率已超出蒋匪官定牌价一倍有余。
