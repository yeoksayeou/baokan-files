　　[This dispatch from our newspaper in Taihang, dated November 11th] The Second Military Sub-district troops and the broad masses of militia, who advanced into the enemy's rear in Taigu to support the masses in distributing autumn harvests and land, have successively won victories, killing and wounding more than twenty enemies, capturing more than forty enemy personnel including a deputy company commander, seizing three machine guns, fifty-seven rifles, one light artillery piece, and more than sixty rounds of ammunition. On the night of October 8th, a certain regiment of our army and a part of the militia, using "luring and decisive attack" tactics, ambushed the enemy on the edge of Xijia Village. They sent a group of militia to fire shots near the enemy stronghold in Ren Village. The puppet district head of the area, believing that our troops were few, coordinated with more than fifty bandits from the Ninth Column dressed in civilian clothes to pursue. When they entered our ambush circle in Xijia, our army issued a command, and with the speed of a tiger pouncing on its prey, charged towards the enemy from all directions. They immediately killed and wounded more than ten enemies, captured nineteen enemy personnel including a deputy company commander, and seized twenty-six rifles, one light artillery piece, and more than sixty rounds of ammunition. On October 20th, more than two hundred bandits from the Ninth Column stationed in @ Village and Guanjia Fort again invaded the area of Jingshen and Pang Village to loot grain. A part of a certain regiment of our military sub-district and the militia work team used a feigned frontal attack and flanking maneuvers to inflict a heavy blow on the enemy. After fierce fighting, the enemy fled in disarray, suffering more than thirty casualties and captures, while we seized three machine guns and thirty-one rifles. This created a small-scale model annihilation battle with a zero-to-thirty casualty ratio.

　　[This dispatch from our newspaper in Taihang, dated November 11th] Since penetrating the enemy's rear to protect the masses in the distribution of autumn harvests and land, the broad masses of the Taigu militia have demonstrated unparalleled courage and tenacity. In the Xijia Village ambush on October 8th, militia hero Sun Wu'er captured two rifles single-handedly, and militia Qiao Erxi also captured two rifles and more than sixty rounds of ammunition. In the battle of Jingshen and Pang Village on October 20th, where they cooperated with the troops to annihilate the bandit Ninth Column, the militia work team alone captured eleven enemies, seized two machine guns, and more than ten rifles.
