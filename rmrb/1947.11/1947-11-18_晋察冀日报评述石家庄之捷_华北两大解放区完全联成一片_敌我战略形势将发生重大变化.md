　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 16th: The Jin-Cha-Ji Daily recently published a commentary on the brilliant victory of the People's Liberation Army in liberating Shijiazhuang and annihilating more than 20,000 Chiang Kai-shek bandits, stating: Only 20 days after the great victory in Qingfengdian, south of Baoding, in which the headquarters of the bandit Third Army and more than 13,000 men were annihilated, the Liberation Army, after six days and nights of fierce fighting, completely liberated Shijiazhuang City, the transportation hub of North China and a strategic stronghold of the Chiang bandits, annihilating the remaining 32nd Division of the Chiang bandit Third Army, as well as the 6th Regiment of the Provisional 32nd Division of Liu Huanan, which had just been airlifted from Baoding to reinforce it, and more than 20 Chiang Kai-shek refugee county governments, "Homecoming Legions," and other personnel, totaling more than 20,000 men. From a strategic point of view, the Jin-Cha-Ji People's Liberation Army has now gained more initiative, while the Chiang bandits are in a more passive position on the Jin-Cha-Ji battlefield. Geographically speaking, with Shijiazhuang City in the hands of the people, the Jin-Cha-Ji and Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu liberated areas have become one, and the entire strategic situation between the enemy and us in North China is bound to undergo major changes.

　　The editorial pointed out: The Chiang Kai-shek gang's propaganda organs, the Central News Agency and its so-called spokesman Deng Wenyi and others, made wild statements such as "Shimen [Shijiazhuang] can be guaranteed to be safe" and "The Liberation Army cannot capture any important cities," all of which were utter nonsense. The editorial continued: Thanks to the meticulous planning and courageous and resourceful attacks of the commanders and fighters of the Liberation Army at all levels, the so-called "permanent fortifications" built by Luo Lirong and others, who inherited the mantle of the Japanese invaders, at great expense over two years, with steel and concrete inside and trenches and power grids outside, were destroyed by the Liberation Army in just a few days; and the successive annihilation of the 7th and 32nd Divisions of the Chiang bandit Third Army by the Liberation Army has become a historical relic. We ask, what new tricks does the Chiang Kai-shek bragging factory have left?

　　The editorial further pointed out: According to the captured documents, the operational deployment of Luo Lirong's Third Army was in accordance with Chiang Kai-shek's personal orders; and the complete annihilation of the army by the Liberation Army is tantamount to giving Chiang Kai-shek two crisp slaps in the face, and it can be predicted that even crisper slaps will continue to land on Chiang Kai-shek's face.

　　Finally, the editorial called on the party, government, army, and people throughout the region not to be dizzy with success due to this victory, or become arrogant and underestimate the enemy, but to be more cautious and humble, plan carefully, combine courage and technology closely, and strive for more and greater victories.

　　晋察冀日报评述石家庄之捷
  　华北两大解放区完全联成一片
    敌我战略形势将发生重大变化
    【新华社晋察冀十六日电】晋察冀日报顷著论评述人民解放军解放石家庄歼蒋匪两万余人之辉煌战绩称：距保（定）南清风店歼匪第三军军部等一万三千余人大捷后仅二十日，解放军再历经六昼夜之激烈战斗，完全解放华北交通轮轴、蒋匪战略要点石家庄市，尽歼蒋匪第三军仅余之三十二师，及甫自保定空运增援之伪刘化南暂编三十二师第六团，及蒋记二十余流亡县政府、“还乡团”等共两万余人。从战略意义上来讲，自此晋察冀人民解放军业已更取得主动，而蒋匪在晋察冀战场则已更处于被动地位。从地理上来说，石家庄市进入人民之手后，晋察冀与晋冀鲁豫两大解放区已联成一片，整个华北敌我战略形势势将发生重大变化。
    社论指出：蒋家匪帮宣传机关中央社及其所谓发言人邓文仪之流大言“石门可保无虞”及所谓“解放军攻不下任何重要城市”等，全为彻头彻尾的狂言呓语。社论继称：由于解放军各级指战员的精心计划和勇猛机智的进击，罗历戎等继承日寇衣钵，费时两年辛苦构筑之内为钢骨水泥、外加壕沟电网之所谓“永久性防御工事”，不及数日，即尽遭解放军摧毁；而蒋匪第三军所属之第七师、三十二师之先后被解放军全部歼灭，业已成为历史上的陈迹。试问蒋家牛皮厂还有什么新货色？
    社论复指出：据缴获之文件证实，罗历戎第三军之作战部署是依照蒋介石本人的手令的；而解放军全歼该军，无异给蒋贼两记清脆的耳光，且可预言更清脆的耳光将会继续不断的落在蒋贼的脸上。
    最后社论号召全区党政军民勿因此次胜利而冲昏头脑，骄傲轻敌，应更谨慎虚心，精心计划，使勇敢与技术紧密结合，争取更多更大的胜利。
