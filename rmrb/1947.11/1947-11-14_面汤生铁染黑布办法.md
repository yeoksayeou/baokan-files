    Method for Dyeing Black Cloth with Noodle Soup and Cast Iron, comrades Lin Dong, Zuo He, etc.:
    Regarding the method for dyeing black cloth with noodle soup and cast iron, the original submitter replies as follows:
    For soaking cast iron in noodle soup, all noodle soups are acceptable except for soybean noodle soup; flour noodle soup from flour mills is also good; for every bowl (one jin weight) of noodle soup, use four liang of cast iron. In hot weather, place it in the shade; in winter, place it near the fire. After rotting for half a month, a layer of gray skin will float on the surface, and it becomes the dye. Black leaves, sheep rake seedlings, star anise leaves (a plant grown on Wulong Mountain in Changzhi, with leaves having eight small corners). In addition to the above three, color tree leaves, hairy incense shells (the fruit of the color tree), and Xiaoxing Mountain (a plant growing in Pingshun Mountain) can also be used; only one type is used when dyeing. For one chi of cloth, use one to two and a half liang of black leaves or hairy incense shells, which is very effective; for the others, two liang is sufficient, the more the better. For one chi of cloth, use one and a half to two jin of noodle soup. When dyeing, first wash the cloth with plain water and wring it dry. Then use the plants to apply a base coat, apply one base coat, and then rub it in the noodle soup, drying it after each application. Three or four applications are enough to dye it well (dyeing it two more times is also acceptable). Finally, wash it with plain water. The dyed cloth does not produce saltpeter and looks beautiful. According to the actual experience of the local people, it can be worn for two more washes (cloth dyed with black alum can be worn for two fewer washes.)

　　面汤生铁染黑布办法林东、作和等同志：
    关于面汤生铁染黑布原投稿人答复如下：
    生铁沤面汤，除了豆面汤不能用，其它面汤都行，粉房的粉条汤也好；每碗一斤重的面汤放四两生铁。热天放在阴处，冬天放在火边，烂上半个月，浮面上有一层灰色皮就成了靛。黑叶，羊耙苗，八角叶（是长治五龙山上生的一种植物，叶子有八个小角）除以上三种外，另外有彩树叶、毛香壳（是彩树的果实）小行山（是平顺山长的一种植物），这三种也能用，染时只用一种。一尺布用黑叶或毛香壳，一两至两半就很行，其它二两就行，越多越好。一尺布用斤半至二斤面汤，染时先将布使白水洗过扭干。再使植物打底，打一遍底，在面汤内搓一遍，每遍晒干再染，有三四遍足能染好（多染两遍也行）。最后使白水洗一遍，染出来布不出硝、漂亮，据此地群众实际经验，能多穿两水（黑矾染的布少穿两水。）
