　　People's Liberation Army on Northern and Southern Fronts
    Annihilates Over 20,000 Enemies, Captures 15 Cities
    According to published statistics, in the week from November 6th to 12th, the People's Liberation Army on the northern and southern fronts annihilated approximately 21,000 enemies and captured 15 cities.
    After a half-month lull, the Yu-Shaan battlefield saw our army launch an offensive on the west side of the Pinghan Railway, stretching 400 li from Dengfeng in the north to Fangcheng in the south, starting on the 1st. Within six days, we annihilated the remnants of the enemy's 15th Division and part of the 47th Division, totaling approximately 5,800 men, capturing alive the commander and deputy commanders of the 15th Division, Wu Tinglin, Yang Tianming, and Yao Beichen, and liberating eight cities including Linru, Lushan, Baofeng, Dengfeng, Nanzhao, Jiaxian, Yexian, and Fangcheng. Currently, our offensive is continuing to expand. A portion of our army along the Longhai Railway is cooperating with local armed forces to continue suppressing bandits.
    On the Su-Lu-Yu-Wan battlefield, the People's Liberation Army launched a full-scale attack on the Xu-Lan section of the Longhai Railway, the main artery of the Chiang bandits' civil war, at dawn on the 9th of this month. After 44 hours of fierce fighting, we completely controlled over 250 li of the railway from Haozhai (30 li west of Xuzhou) to Zhuji (north of Shangqiu), and 50 li from Yejigang (west of Minquan) to Quantou (20 li east of Lanfeng), and captured 18 enemy strongholds including the county towns of Dangshan and Xiayi, the stations of Neihuang, and the stronghold of Liukou. We annihilated the entire 7th Brigade of the Chiang bandit Provisional 24th Division, one regiment of the 6th Brigade, and miscellaneous diehards such as the Jiangsu Provincial Security Team and the Home Return Corps, capturing 6,000 enemies and routing the Chiang army's Reorganized 5th Division, killing and wounding about 1,000 enemies. Another unit of our army captured Boxian County three times on the 6th.
    On the Northeast battlefield, two days after the enemy's 92nd Army's 21st Division was annihilated, that is, at dawn on the 4th, a certain unit of our cavalry annihilated the enemy's 174th Division headquarters and two regiments at Xujiadian, 50 li northeast of Jinzhou, capturing alive over 1,200 men. In this battle, we suffered only a dozen casualties, creating a brilliant battle example with a ratio of 1 to 100. While the Chiang bandits were clamoring to "open up the Chang-Shen traffic," another unit of our army annihilated most of the enemy's Provisional 56th Division, which was invading south from Changchun, in the Datun and Caojiatun areas south of Changchun on the morning of the 3rd. At the same time, we annihilated part of the enemy's Huaide Security Regiment northwest of Gongzhuling, annihilating more than 2,100 enemies in both battles, making the "opening up of the Chang-Shen traffic" a pipe dream. The Beining Railway from Xinmin to Dahushan has been severely damaged after our army's large-scale attacks on the 1st and 2nd. Even the Associated Press said, "The Communists have taken a step forward in the ultimate goal of causing the collapse of the Nationalists' corridor."
    Currently, the Arctic cold current is crossing Manchuria, and Xinmin has already seen snowfall. The Chiang Kai-shek and Chen Cheng bandit gangs in the Northeast are confined to the area south of Siping and north of Anshan along the Zhongchang Railway and the Beining Railway, as well as isolated strongholds north of Changchun, Jilin, and the Songhua River, facing a cold winter with shortages of food, coal, and electricity.
    On the Northwest battlefield, after annihilating the 76th Division, our army advanced to the city of Yulin and controlled the airport on the 27th, cutting off the Chiang bandits' air escape and reinforcement routes. On the 31st, in the mop-up operation around the perimeter, we annihilated 1,500 men. In total, we routed two regiments of the enemy's 22nd Army's 86th Division and annihilated over 1,500 men. At the same time, a unit of our army liberated Shenmu County, northeast of Yulin, on the 31st. The Chiang bandit Central News Agency has been screaming about this for days, and Fu Zuoyi is in a panic, flying back and forth, while Hu Zongnan has remained silent.
    In the Southwest Shanxi area, we recovered Xiangning on the 29th of last month. Since then, the entire Southwest Shanxi area west of the Tongpu Railway to the south bank of the Yellow River has been liberated, and the isolated city of Linfen has become even more isolated.
    On the Jiaodong battlefield, we recovered Zhaoyuan on the 3rd and Pingdu on the 8th. The Chiang bandits invading Weihai have been blocked in the Mianhuashan area, facing the city with their backs to the mountains, sighing in vain. On both sides of the Binhai Lin (Yi) Tao (Luo) Highway, our local corps, in coordination with the militia, annihilated 2,400 enemies on the 29th of last month and on the 4th, 5th, and 6th of this month, and liberated vast areas.
    In the Jin-Cha-Ji area, after we annihilated the enemy's 3rd Army, the enemy hastily gathered some forces and made foolish moves in the Ping-Jin-Bao triangle area, and successively invaded Baxian and Maoerwan and other places in an attempt to secure their lairs. The isolated enemy strongholds south of Baoding are in an increasingly precarious situation, and our army is currently taking the initiative in combat.
    In the Hubei-Henan-Anhui area, after the victory at Jieling Gaoshanpu, the Chiang bandits turned pale at the mention of our army, in extreme fear. The Chiang bandits' Yangtze River transport has been completely cut off; the fact that the Sheng Fu Chiang bandits will set up a headquarters in Jiujiang reflects the "increasing deterioration" of the Chiang bandit military situation north of the Yangtze River.

### 南北各战场人民解放军  歼敌二万余克城十五座

　　南北各战场人民解放军
    歼敌二万余克城十五座
    十一月六日至十二日一周间南北各战场人民解放军，根据已公布者统计，先后共歼敌约二万一千余人，克城十五座。
    沉寂半月的豫陕战场，自一日起我军在平汉路西侧，北起登封、南至方城四百里战线上发动攻势。六天内歼敌第十五师残部及四十七师一部共约五千八百余人，生俘十五师正副师长武庭麟、杨天明、姚北辰等，解放临汝、鲁山、宝丰、登封、南召、郏线、叶县、方城等八城。刻我攻势尚在继续扩张中。陇海沿线我军一部，则配合地方武装继续清剿土匪。
    苏鲁豫皖战场，解放军于本月九日拂晓向蒋匪内战大动脉陇海路徐州兰封段进行全线大破击，经四十四小时激战，已全部控制铁路郝寨（徐州西卅里）至朱集（商邱北）二百五十余里，及野鸡岗（民权西）至圈头（兰封东二十里）段五十里，并攻克砀山、夏邑两县城、内黄等车站及刘口等据点共十八处。歼灭蒋匪暂二十四师之第七旅全部、第六旅一个团及江苏省保安队、还乡团杂顽等，俘敌六千人，并击溃出援之蒋军整五师，毙伤敌约千余人。另部我军于六日三次攻克亳县城。
    东北战场，敌九二军廿一师被歼后两日，即四日拂晓，我骑兵某部于锦州东北五十里之徐家店歼灭敌一七四师师部及两个团，生俘一千二百余名，是役我仅伤亡十余名，造成一比一百的光辉战例。在蒋匪大叫“打通长沈交通”之际，我军另部三日晨在长春以南大屯、曹家屯一带歼灭由长南犯的敌暂五十六师大部，同时于公主岭西北歼灭敌怀德保安团一部，两役歼敌两千一百多名，使“打通长沈交通”成了梦呓。自新民至大虎山一段的北宁路，经我军于一、二两日大破击后，已经破碎不堪，就连美联社也说：“在使国军走廊大崩溃的最后目标方面，共军已向前迈进了一步。”
    目前北寒带的寒流正越过满洲，新民业已落雪。东北蒋陈匪帮局促于四平以南、鞍山以北之中长路及北宁沿线，以及北面孤悬于长春、吉林与松花江北岸之据点中，面临缺粮、缺煤和缺电之寒冬。
    西北战场，我军于歼灭七十六师之后，即挺进榆林城下，二十七日控制机场，使蒋匪空中逃路援路均告断绝。三十一日扫清外围战斗中，我即歼灭一千五百名。总计是役击溃敌二十二军八十六师两个团，歼灭一千五百余人。与此同时，我军一部于三十一日解放榆林东北之神木县城。蒋匪中央社对此连日惊叫，傅作义慌做一团，飞来飞去，而胡宗南则已一声不吭了。
    晋西南方面，我上月二十九日即将乡宁收复，自此同蒲路以西迄黄河南岸之晋西南已全获解放，临汾孤城愈益孤立。
    胶东战场，我三日收复招远，八日收复平度，进犯威市之蒋匪一直被阻于棉花山一带，临山背水，望城兴叹。在滨海临（沂）涛（雒）公路的两侧，我地方兵团配合民兵先后于上月二十九日及本月四、五、六三日中歼敌两千四百名，并解放了广大地区。
    晋察冀方面，我歼敌第三军后，敌七拼八凑的集中了一些兵力在平津保三角地区蠢动，并先后侵占霸县、毛尔湾等地，以图确保其老巢。保南敌占各孤立据点，处境日益危殆，目前我军正主动作战中。
    鄂豫皖方面，在界岭高山铺大捷后，蒋匪对我大军谈虎色变，惊恐不已。蒋匪长江军运，业已完全割断；盛傅蒋匪将在九江设立司令部，此点反映大江以北蒋匪军事情势的“日益恶化”。（新华社）
