Xinhua News Agency, Eyuwan, 20th: This reporter Fang De reports: The people's guerrilla warfare in southern Anhui is developing vigorously, and the mass movement to fight local tyrants and distribute grain and wealth is also rising fiercely. The people's armed forces are active in 14 counties in southern Anhui, including Guangde, Langxi, Wuhu, Xuancheng, Ningguo, Jingxian, Nanling, Taiping, Jingde, Shexian, Guichi, Yixian, Jixi, and Changhua in western Zhejiang, and five patriotic people's county governments have been established. Since the People's Liberation Army crossed the Longhai Railway and launched a large-scale counter-offensive, the people's armed forces in southern Anhui have launched large-scale attacks. On September 18th, the People's Guerrilla Force of Maolin, Jingxian County, suddenly appeared on the streets of Maolin Town (note: the Anhui Southern Incident in 1941, in which the Chiang Kai-shek bandits betrayed their trust and besieged the New Fourth Army, occurred in this area). The two Bao police detachments of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits stationed there and their reinforcements, a total of three detachments, were all forced to surrender their weapons. A police training officer named Chen was shot dead on the spot. The People's Guerrilla Force took advantage of the victory to directly attack Jingxian County, sweeping the entire county and capturing important strongholds such as Zhangjiadu, Dingtang, and Yangongtang.

Under the influence of the victorious attacks of the people's armed forces, the local people rose up to resist the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and local bullies. When the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' first district joint defense team of Jixi went to the countryside to rob grain and demand money, the people cooperated with the guerrillas to ambush them. A part of the fleeing remnants fled in panic. In early October, the masses led the guerrillas to capture the third district joint defense team, capturing the joint defense director Hu Dengshu and more than ten people and guns from the joint defense office. The masses used the captured weapons to carry out struggles against grain requisitioning, tax collecting, and conscription. The strength of the masses is growing day by day, and many Chiang Kai-shek "self-defense teams" and local soldiers are carrying guns to join. In places where there are no guerrillas, the masses also automatically rise up to destroy blockhouses, fight local tyrants, and distribute floating wealth. In the Zhamenkou area of Xuancheng, the people automatically rose up to destroy the blockhouses and brought the heinous local bullies Guo Changyou and Zhong Sanmazi to justice. More than 20,000 people in Xincun and Baohua villages in Lijing Township, Langxi, automatically rose up to capture the evil landlord Huang Liding and divided more than 300 piculs of grain and a large number of clothes and farm tools.

After the Chiang Kai-shek's township and Bao regime and armed forces in southern Anhui were jointly attacked by the people and the guerrillas, some surrendered to the guerrillas, and some idled and fled, quickly tending to collapse. The orders of the Chiang Kai-shek Jixi County Government can only be exercised within the county government. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits have launched two district "suppression" campaigns against the people's armed forces, but both were crushed. The Chiang Kai-shek gang is staring anxiously at the vigorous development of the people's armed forces in the heart of its ruling area. (Attached picture)

　　皖南浙西十四个县人民武装大发展
  　建立五个爱国人民县府     
    群众打土豪分财粮运动正猛烈兴起
    【新华社鄂豫皖二十日电】本社记者方德报导：皖南人民游击战争如火如荼发展，群众打土豪、分粮财的运动亦猛烈兴起。人民武装活跃于皖南广德、郎溪、芜湖、宣城、宁国、泾县、南陵、太平、旌德、歙县、贵池、黟县、绩溪和浙西的昌化等十四个县，且已建立五个爱国人民县政府。自人民解放军越过陇海路大举反攻后，皖南人民武装即举行大规模出击。九月十八日，泾县茂林的人民游击队突然出现于茂林镇街头（按：一九四一年蒋匪背信弃义围攻新四军的皖南事变即在该地发生），盘踞该地的蒋匪两保警分队及其增援部队，共三个分队，全部被迫缴械。保警队训练员陈某当场被击毙。人民游击队乘胜直取泾县县城，横扫全县，攻克章家渡、丁潭、晏公堂等重要据点。
    在人民武装胜利出击的影响下，当地群众纷起反抗蒋匪土劣统治。绩溪蒋匪第一区联防队下乡抢粮索款，老百姓即配合游击队打伏击，其中一部，残匪狼狈逃窜。十月初，群众又带领游击队去捉拿第三区联防队，将联防主任胡戥树与联防处人枪各十余全部俘获，群众即利用缴获枪械进行抗粮、抗捐、抗丁斗争。群众力量日趋壮大，许多蒋记“自卫队”、乡丁都扛着枪前来参加。在没有游击队的地方，群众亦自动起来毁碉堡、打土豪、分浮财。宣城榨门口一带，人民即自动起来平毁碉堡，将罪大恶极的土劣郭长有、钟三麻子明正典刑。郎溪离井乡的新村、保花村两万多群众，自动起来捉拿恶霸地主黄立鼎，分了三百多石谷子和大批衣服、农具。
    皖南蒋匪乡保政权和武装，遭到人民和游击队的联合打击之后，有的向游击队投诚，有的怠工逃跑，迅速趋于瓦解。绩溪蒋匪县政府的命令，只能在县政府以内行使。蒋匪曾对人民武装进行两次分区“清剿”，均被粉碎。蒋家匪帮面对其统治心脏地区人民武装的蓬勃发展，瞪着两眼干着急。（附图片）
