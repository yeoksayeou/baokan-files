　　Puyang Fourth District Rectifies Village Finances
    [This newspaper, Jilu Yu, 24th dispatch] Puyang Fourth District is rectifying village finances, and every village wants to compete for the top spot. At the district's meeting of more than 380 village cadres, everyone recognized the significance of saving money to support the front lines and began a discussion on rectifying village burdens. First, they reviewed the past chaotic and unreasonable expenditures. For example, two laborers from Zhu Xiaoqiu went to the dam to inspect the levee, only ten-odd li away, yet they received 2,000 yuan in travel expenses; there were many such examples. Subsequently, they discussed the items that should be expensed by the village, which included three categories: first, village expenses, including pens, ink, paper, lamp oil, travel expenses, etc.; second, education expenses, including teacher salaries and miscellaneous teacher expenses; and third, militia expenses, such as repairing guns and gun oil. They also discussed the annual expenditure standards. During the discussions, villages challenged each other in competition. Every village expressed its desire to compete for the top spot in the year-end summary.

　　濮阳四区整顿村财政
    【本报冀鲁豫二十四日电】濮阳四区整理村财政，村村都想争头名。全区三百八十余名的村干会上，大家认识了节约支前的意义，展开了对整理村负担的讨论，先检讨了过去开支混乱与不合理，如朱小邱两个民工，去坝头看堤，仅离堤十余里，便领两千元的路费；此类例子很多。随后讨论村中应开支的项目有三：第一、村经费，包括笔、墨、纸、灯油、路费等；第二、教育费，包括教员粮及教员公杂费等；第三、武装费，修理枪及擦枪油等。又讨论了每年开支的标准，在讨论中，村与村挑战竞赛。村村表示要在年终总结时争头名。
