Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: A comprehensive report: On the 12th, the UN Political Committee, with the victory of democratic forces, concluded the discussion of the Spanish question. The meeting recommended that the General Assembly reaffirm last year's resolution and considered that the Security Council would fulfill its responsibilities in accordance with the Charter when necessary. The attempt by U.S. imperialism to overturn last year's UN General Assembly resolution (i.e., not allowing Spain to participate in the United Nations and recalling ambassadors from Spain) has thus failed. At the meeting on the 11th, the Polish representative announced: "Terror still reigns in Spain. Since last year's resolution, 197 people have been killed in Spain, and 4,106 men and women are languishing in prison." Poland called on the General Assembly to reaffirm last year's resolution and suggested that the Security Council rectify the current situation in Spain. The Czech representative emphasized that foreign aid to Franco reminded people of Munich. Soviet representative Gromyko condemned the open support of the Franco fascist regime by the United States, Britain, Argentina and other countries, saying: The United States provided private loans to Franco to equip and supply uranium mines in Spain. British and American enterprises maintain close economic ties with Spain. British exports to Spain in the first eight months of this year are about one and a half times the total for the entire year of 1942. Gromyko exposed that "the U.S. and British governments are attempting to legalize these actions." Those supporting the Polish proposal included the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Belarus, Ukraine, India, and some Latin American countries. The Dominican Republic, Pakistan, Peru, El Salvador, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Nicaragua and others opposed the Polish proposal. The U.S. representative openly acted as Franco's defender, resolutely opposing the use of any sanctions; he said: "The Spanish government has no symbol or desire for aggression, and there is no need to force Spain to change its government through measures that the Security Council can take." As a result, the Soviet Union, Poland, and other countries defeated the opposition of the United States and Britain, and the Political Committee passed the current compromise proposal.

　　联大政委会讨论西班牙问题
  　决定重申去年决议
    美帝破坏阴谋已告落空
    【新华社陕北十九日电】综合报导：十二日联大政委会以民主势力的胜利，结束了西班牙问题的讨论。会议建议联大重申去年决议，并认为安理会于必需时将按照宪章尽其职责。美帝国主义推翻去年联大决议（即不准西参加联合国与召回各国驻西使节）的企图，至此乃告落空。在十一日会上波兰代表宣布：“恐布仍统治着西班牙，自去年决议以来，在西班牙已有一九七人被杀，四一○六男女憔悴于狱中。”波吁请大会重申去年决议，并建议安理会纠正西班牙现存局势。捷代表强调外国对佛朗哥之援助，使人记起了慕尼黑。苏代表葛罗米柯谴责美、英、阿根廷等国公开支持佛朗哥法西斯政权说：美国由私人贷款给佛朗哥，以装备供给西班牙的铀矿，英美企业与西经济保持密切联系，英对西输出今年八个月约等于一九四二年全年的一倍半。葛氏揭发“美英政府正企图使这些行动合法化”。支持波建议的有苏、捷、南、白、乌克兰、印及某些拉丁美洲国家。多米尼加、巴基斯坦、秘鲁、萨尔瓦多、比、加、智利、尼加拉瓜等反对波兰建议，美代表则公然充当佛朗哥的辩护士，坚决反对使用任何制裁；他说：“西班牙政府没有侵略的象征或欲望，而且也没有必要以安理会所能采取的措施强迫西班牙改换政府。”结果，苏、波等国击败美英的反对，而使政委会通过了目前的折衷案。
