　　Wei Xiaolou Village Carefully Calculates Harvest
　　Engages in Sideline Occupations to Supplement Grain Shortage
　　[Our newspaper, Jinnan, 13th dispatch] Yuan Dynasty's Wei Xiaolou Village carefully calculated their harvest and determined that the grain would not last until the next wheat harvest. They decided to engage in sideline occupations to supplement the grain shortage. The village currently cultivates 1,145 mu of land. After deducting 51 mu of cotton fields, there are 1,094 mu of crop land remaining, yielding a total of 549 shi, 2 dou, and 6 sheng (market measure) of coarse grains. The entire village population is 319 people, averaging 1 shi and 5 dou and 2 sheng of coarse grain per person. Each able-bodied adult needs to eat 1.5 sheng of coarse grain per day, while the elderly and children need half a sheng. On average, each person needs 1 sheng per day, totaling 3 shi and 1 dou and 9 sheng for the entire village. From August 1st of this year to April 25th of next year, a total of 264 days, 842 shi, 3 dou, and 6 sheng will be needed, resulting in a shortage of 292 shi and 9 dou. This calculation does not include public grain contributions and household miscellaneous expenses. After this calculation, the masses all felt that this was a major problem. Each group started discussions to find solutions, and everyone unanimously agreed to engage in business. To avoid delaying agriculture, after the mutual aid groups completed the autumn harvest and wheat planting, they immediately ground flour. Those with labor pushed wheelbarrows to sell grain and cotton. Every household economized to supplement the grain shortage.

　　[Our newspaper, Jinnan, 13th dispatch] Since Xinxian's Ding Village called for a large-scale production campaign, five agricultural mutual aid groups (40 people) were organized. Since autumn, the land has been flooded, and all the villagers have had nothing to do. The team leader, Ding Dingchen, in order to overcome the flood, first convened a symposium of mutual aid group leaders, proposing that agriculture should be shifted to sideline occupations. After everyone's discussion, sideline mutual aid groups were freely formed, including four wheelbarrow transport groups traveling between Linqing and Xinxian, and three flour mills, each increasing capital by tens of thousands of yuan; the government also loaned them hundreds of thousands of yuan. They go to Linqing once every five days, taking beans and returning with large salt, medicinal materials, and foreign cigarettes, earning 100,000 yuan each time. The three flour mills can grind 1 shi and 5 dou of mung beans per day, earning 6,000 yuan. Eating bean dregs and flour paste at home can save another 5 dou of grain. Calculated in this way, they earn 260,000 yuan and save 5 dou of grain every ten days.

　　魏小楼村细算收成
  　搞副业补足缺粮
    【本报冀南十三日电】元朝魏小楼村细算收成，粮食吃不到明年麦天，决定搞副业，补足缺粮。全村现耕地一千一百四十五亩，除去棉花地五十一亩，净剩一千零九十四亩庄稼地，共收粗粮五百四十九石二斗六升（市斗），全村老少人口共三百十九人，每人平均粗粮一石五斗二升。青壮年每天需吃升半粗粮，老幼每天需吃半升，平均每人每天需吃一升，全村每天吃三石一斗九升，从今年八月初一日起至明年四月二十五日止，二百六十四天，需吃八百四十二石三斗六升，缺二百九十二石九斗。这样还未计算出公粮，家庭杂支项目。这个帐算好，群众人人都感到这是个大问题。各组展开讨论想办法，大家一致要干买卖。为不误农业，在互助秋收种麦完成后，大家即刻磨粉，有劳动力的推小车贩买粮、棉，家家省吃俭用，以补缺粮数目。
    【本报冀南十三日电】莘县丁庄自号召大生产运动后，组织了五个农业互助组（四十人）。入秋以来，地被大水淹了，全村群众都没了活做。中队长丁鼎臣为渡过水灾，首先召开了一个互助组长座谈会，在会上提出应由农业转副业。经过大家讨论，自由结合副业互助组，有四个小车组来往临清莘县运输，三个粉坊，每个增加资本数万元；政府又贷给了几十万元。他们去临清五天一次，去时推豆子，回来带大盐、药材、洋烟，这样每次可赚洋十万元。三个粉坊每天可磨一石五斗绿豆，获利六千元。在家吃豆渣及粉浆饭又可省粮食五小斗。这样算起来，十天赚钱二十六万元，省粮食五小斗。
