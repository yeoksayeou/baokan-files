Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. The just movement of students in the Kuomintang-controlled areas against oppression and for freedom is rapidly rising. According to an Associated Press report from Peking on the 6th, major middle schools in Peking staged a one-day general strike on the 6th to protest the tragic murder of Yu Zisan (formerly mistakenly reported as Yu Zeshan), chairman of the Zhejiang University Student Self-Government Association, in prison by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, and the atrocities of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in arresting and massacring students in various places. This is a new great resistance of Chiang Kai-shek controlled students following the anti-American imperialism movement in January this year and the anti-hunger and anti-civil war movement in May and June this year. It is widely believed that the student strike in Peking, which has always been the cradle of Chinese student patriotic movements, has great significance. According to the Associated Press, students from Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University and other schools went to the streets to promote their cause, posting slogans and distributing Chiang Kai-shek banknotes worth thousands of yuan with protest slogans printed on them as leaflets - they believed that no one would be willing to tear up the banknotes, so they could expand their propaganda. Students from various schools solicited donations from the public and collectively fasted for one day, donating all the proceeds to the family of the martyr Yu Zisan. The striking students of Peking University also requested Chiang Kai-shek to allow students to send representatives to visit the arrested students in Peking to see if they had been subjected to abuse by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. In addition to the one-day general strike on the 6th by major middle schools in Peking, Tsinghua University has been on strike for three days since the 4th, Yenching University has been on strike for two days since the 5th, and Peking University has been on strike for two days on the 6th. Zhejiang University in Hangzhou went on strike for a week from the 30th of last month to denounce Chiang Kai-shek's crime.

Xinhua News Agency, Central Hebei, 8th. Simultaneously with the just movement of students in Peking against oppression and for freedom since last month, the municipal primary and secondary schools in Peking broke out in a strike for survival starting on the 24th of last month. According to the Tianjin Republic Daily on the 26th, the faculty and staff of the municipal middle schools in Peking, due to the rising prices and the inability to maintain their lives, had previously submitted a request to the Chiang Kai-shek municipal government to distribute supplies, provide coal for winter use with reference to the university's method, reissue the shortfall of 200,000 yuan in kind for August, and increase the base salary, and pay the October salary according to the new standard. After repeated evasion by the Chiang Kai-shek municipal government and the Education Bureau, on October 24, the municipal primary and secondary schools in Peking went on strike in various ways, with some faculty and staff taking full leave, some not showing up automatically, and all teachers and students going on a trip to the suburbs. The Chiang Kai-shek municipal government was greatly panicked by this and used various means to deceive and persuade the schools to resume classes the next day, but the faculty and staff of the schools refused to resume classes because the goal had not been achieved and they could not maintain their lives. On the 25th, they continued the strike. More than 100 principals of middle schools and representatives of primary schools held meetings separately and decided to establish a teachers and staff association, and elected seven representatives to continue the struggle.

    声讨蒋贼捕杀浙大同学
    北平各学校总罢课
    中小学教职员要求吃饱饭全体罢教
    【新华社陕北七日电】蒋管区学生反压迫、争自由的正义运动迅速高涨。据美联社北平六日讯：平市各大中学六日爆发总罢课一天，抗议浙大学生自治会主席于子三（前误为俞泽山）在狱中惨遭蒋匪杀害，及蒋匪在各地逮捕屠杀学生之暴行。此为蒋管学生继今年一月反对美帝国主义运动，及今年五、六月反饥饿、反内战运动之后的新的伟大反抗，众信历来都是中国学生爱国运动摇篮的北平学生罢课有重大意义。据美联社称：北大、清华、燕大等校学生均出动街头宣传，张贴标语，并散布书有抗议口号的千元蒋钞以代传单——他们认为没有人愿意将钞票撕毁，因而可以扩大宣传。各校学生向社会人士进行募捐，并集体节食一天，将所得全部救济于子三烈士家属。北大罢课学生，并请求蒋匪准许学生推派代表探视平市被捕同学，看看他们是否遭受蒋匪虐待。此次平市罢课除各大中学在六日总罢课一天外，清华于四日起罢课三天，燕大于五日起罢课两天，北大于六日起罢课两天。杭州浙大为声讨蒋匪此次罪行，曾于上月三十日起罢课一周。
    【新华社冀中八日电】与上月以来北平学生进行反压迫，争自由正义运动同时，上月二十四日起，北平市立各中小学曾爆发求生存罢教运动。据天津民国日报二十六日讯：平市市立各中学教职员，因物价日高，无法维持生活，曾于日前向蒋记市府提出配发实物，参照大学办法配给冬季用煤，补发八月份实物差额金二十万元，提高底薪，十月份薪金按新标准发给等要求。经蒋记市府及教育局一再推诿后，十月二十四日，市立各中小学以各种方式进行罢教，有教职员全部请假的，有自动不到的，有全部师生赴郊外旅行的，蒋记市府对此大起恐慌，用种种手段进行欺骗，劝告各校于翌日复教，但各校教职员以目的未达无法维持生活，遂拒绝复教要求，于二十五日继续罢教，各中学校长及各小学代表百余人分别集会，决定成立教职员联谊会，选代表七人继续进行斗争。
