The Unyielding People of Southern Shaanxi
　　·Lu Cun·
　　　　(1) Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Tyranny
　　Southern Shaanxi, along the West Jing Highway and the Dan River basin, is full of fertile rice paddies and has a relatively mild climate. However, after the bloody rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, it has now become a miserable hell on earth.

　　After General Li Xiannian withdrew from southern Shaanxi this spring, Chiang Kai-shek's five divisions and many small armed gangs repeatedly carried out "encirclement and suppression" and "village clearing." They not only used the Japanese invaders' "burn all, kill all, loot all" policy, but also adopted the Japanese invaders' "village consolidation" method in the Northeast, forcing the people to move to Sichuan. Now, from Mudongliu in Lushi in the east to Luonan and Shangxian in the west, and from Shangnan Shangxia Piaochi in the south, except for the villages and towns along the highway, the vast area has been burned down by Chiang Kai-shek bandits, leaving only smoke-blackened walls and broken branches of trees. There is no one for hundreds of miles. When individual farmers hiding in the mountains accuse the Chiang Kai-shek bandits of their atrocities to the People's Liberation Army, they all shed tears. They said: "During the village clearing, everything was looted, and countless people were killed. In Shangluo Town near Longjuzhai alone, more than fifty people were killed in two hundred households. Many people were cut in half with a铡刀 (a铡刀 is a type of guillotine used in rural areas). At the beginning of autumn, the corn along the West Jing Highway and beside the road had just grown. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits, fearing the activities of the guerrillas, ordered them all to be cut down, resulting in a failed autumn harvest. Now we can only drink two meals of "hutang" (thin porridge made of cornmeal) a day.

　　On the road from Shangxian to Shangnan, the reporter saw crowds of beggars everywhere. On September 26, when a mass meeting was held to open Longjuzhai, the masses all came with bags. After the meeting, our army gave them most of its food. On October 3, when Shangnan City was liberated, our army distributed food and clothing. Many people ran from afar despite the heavy rain.

　　Because there was no cloth, the local women with bound feet also wore straw sandals. A farmer in her thirties, carrying a broken basket, had clothes that were so tattered that her flesh was exposed. She said with tears in her eyes: "Comrades, there is no way, I really can't see people. The grain was all robbed by old Chiang Kai-shek, and we were forced to build the city walls and trenches."

　　　　(2) Hard Bones Who Persist in Their Positions

　　When our army transferred this spring, countless fighters were left behind to defend their positions. In the most adverse circumstances, the people's guerrillas in this area dispersed into smaller units and went into the mountains to launch a life-and-death struggle. There were more than fifty people's guerrillas in the area from Luonan to Shangnan. Some of the smallest guerrilla units had only six or seven people, but no one bowed to the enemy. One guerrilla fighter was left alone, so he temporarily went to a village not far west of Longjuzhai to "watch the house" for a big landlord. As soon as our army arrived in this village, he immediately led the troops to settle accounts with this big landlord.

　　Even in the most dangerous circumstances, the people of southern Shaanxi still loved the people's soldiers. At that time, the masses in Longjuzhai and other strongholds of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits on the highway carried white rice to the mountains to deliver public grain to the guerrillas. A certain district political commissar, Comrade Wang Li, fell ill. A farmer only fifteen miles away from Shangxian took him home to live. In Jingcun, Shangnan, a company commander of our army was hidden. When the enemy's "village clearing" team came, many farmers were beaten, and one was even cruelly cut off an arm by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, but no one betrayed to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits.

　　不屈的陕南人民
    ·鲁村·
    　　　　（一）蒋匪暴政
    陕西南部，沿着西荆公路和丹江流域，到处都是丰饶的稻田，天气也较温和，但是经过蒋匪血腥的统治，现在却成了凄惨的人间地狱。
    今春李先念将军撤离陕南后，蒋匪五个师及许多小股武装；反复进行“围剿”和“清乡”。他们不但使用日寇烧光、杀光、抢光的三光政策，并且搬用了日寇在东北的“并村”办法，强迫老百姓迁到川地。如今东起卢氏的木洞溜，西到雒南、商县。南至商南上下漂池的广大地区，除掉沿公路的村镇外，都被蒋匪一把火烧光，只剩下浓烟薰黑的四壁和树木的残枝。数百里内渺无人烟。个别躲在山沟里的农民向解放军控诉蒋匪的暴行时，莫不声泪俱下，他们说：“当进行清乡时，什么都被抢走了，老百姓被杀的不计其数，光龙驹寨附近的商雒镇，二百来户人家，就杀死了五十多个。许多人是用铡刀切成两段。秋初，西荆公路沿线与大道旁边的包谷，刚刚长成，蒋匪害怕游击队活动，竟一律下令砍掉，致秋收落空。现每日仅能喝上两顿“糊汤”（包谷糁子煮的稀饭）。
    记者由商县到商南的路上，随处都见拥塞着讨吃的人群。九月二十六日，打开龙驹寨召开群众大会时，群众都夹着口袋来，会后我军便把自己食粮的大部分给了他们。十月三日解放商南城，我军发放粮食和衣服，许多人都不顾大雨淋，老远跑来了。
    因为没有布，当地小脚女人也穿着草鞋。有个三十多岁的农妇，手里提着一个破篮子，浑身的衣服烂成片片露着肉。流着眼泪说：“同志呀，没的办法，实在没法见人呀，粮都让老蒋抢走，城墙沟壕都是逼着我们修的呀。”
    　　　　（二）坚持阵地的硬骨头
    当我大军今春转移时，曾留下无数斗士，坚守阵地，在环境最恶劣的时候，这地区的人民游击队化整为零，转入山地，展开你死我活的斗争。雒南到商南的地区，就有五十多支人民游击队。有些人数最少的游击队，只有六个或七个人，但是谁也不向敌人低头。有个游击队员打得只剩下他一个人，他便暂时到离龙驹寨西边不远的一个村庄，雇给大地主“看家”，我军一到这村，他便立即引着部队去清算这家大地主。
    即使在最险恶的情况下，陕南人民仍然是热爱着人民的战士。那时公路上的蒋匪据点龙驹寨等地的群众，曾背着白米，到山上找游击队送公粮。某区政委王立同志病了，有个离商县只十五里的农民，把他接到家里住下。商南荆村，藏下我军一个连长，当敌清乡队来到时，许多农民挨了毒打，有一个甚至被蒋匪残忍的砍去一条臂膊，但却没一个人向蒋匪告密。（新华社豫鄂陕前线电）
