　　Mass Line Strictly Reviewed
  　Qinshui Rectifies Militia, Establishes Poor and Lower-Middle Peasant Backbone
    [Our Newspaper, Taiyue, 8th Dispatch] Qinshui's militia universally uses poor and lower-middle peasants as the backbone to reorganize the organization, cleanse the targets of struggle, and enhance class consciousness and combat effectiveness. During the cleansing in each village, all militiamen are first reviewed within their groups, then opinions are exchanged among themselves, and finally announced at a general meeting. There are three principles for cleansing: (1) All targets of struggle and their children in the land reform are to be cleansed. (2) All suspicious elements with unclear political backgrounds are to be cleansed. (3) All those who are not members of the Peasants' Association are to be cleansed. After the cleansing, the conditions for future development were decided: 1. Take the emancipated poor and lower-middle peasants as the backbone. 2. Be politically reliable and work actively. 3. Must be a member of the Peasants' Association. After the reorganization, the masses in Zhang Village said, "This is truly our peasants' armed force."
    [Our Newspaper, Taiyue, 8th Dispatch] In order to devote all its strength to the great counter-offensive, the Qinshui Military Committee has now begun to reorganize and establish militia field companies. It has gained the following experience: 1. Administrative orders do not work. In the past, the Third District reorganized the organization three or four times, but because the cadres were afraid of trouble and liked simplicity, "an order was passed down on paper, and no one dared to disobey." Regardless of the number of guns, the number of people, or who they were, they were muddledly compiled and considered complete. On the surface, it looked neat, but problems constantly occurred during several expeditions. Some landlords' sons and rogue soldiers took the opportunity to disrupt mass discipline and desert. For example, when the Zhang Village militia went on an expedition to Hejin, four of them ran away as a result. When Nanyang Village in the First District reorganized the organization last year, a few cadres and activists danced naked and, in a frenzy, stipulated several conditions: 1. Age between eighteen and thirty-five. 2. Strong physique (even minor illnesses were not allowed). 3. Must have military uniforms, military shoes, and socks. 4. Have fought battles, have experience, and be accurate with guns. As a result, a squad of ten people was organized, all of whom were local ruffians and landlords' sons, while those so-called unqualified were precisely the poor and lower-middle peasants. They could not afford military uniforms and could not speak beautiful words, so they were not organized. The field militia composed of landlords and rogue soldiers were idle every day, strutting around, and everyone opposed them. (2) It is necessary to follow the mass line. This time, in the organization and reorganization, the administrative order style was overcome, and the mass line was followed, which achieved great results. In Zhang Village, the Second District, the meetings of militia squad leaders, mutual aid team leaders, and cadres of various systems were first convened to study the reorganization methods and specific measures. Then, discussions were held in each militia squad and mutual aid team to conduct a mass review of the militia's composition and performance. The opinions of each group were then submitted to the village standing committee for research and synthesis, and then everyone was allowed to study them. After such deliberation and review, it was proposed that six targets of struggle and two rogue soldiers could not participate in the militia, and it was said, "These people prostitute themselves every day without working. They wear military uniforms and carry guns around the village, scaring the common people. When they set off, they either feign illness or ask for travel expenses. They are not like our own armed forces." After the masses exposed them, they were announced on the public blackboard for the masses to deal with. After everyone's discussion, all six targets of struggle were expelled, and the rogue soldiers were temporarily retained as reserve militiamen, waiting for them to improve before formally joining. Although Zhang Dengdi was not a target of struggle, he was also expelled by the masses for disrupting mass discipline and deserting. At this point, the masses began to feel that the militia was their own armed force.

　　群众路线严格审查
  　沁水整顿民兵  树立贫雇骨干
    【本报太岳八日电】沁水民兵普遍以贫雇为骨干整理组织，清洗斗争对象，提高阶级觉悟与战斗力。各村清洗中，先在小组内将所有民兵审查后，再互相交换意见，最后在大会上宣布。清洗的原则有三：（一）土改中的斗争对象与其子弟一律清洗。（二）政治面目不清的可疑分子一律清洗。（三）不是农会会员一律清洗。清洗之后，又决定今后发展条件：一、以翻身贫雇农为骨干。二、政治上可靠，工作积极。三、必须是农会会员。整理后，张村群众说：“这才是咱们农民的武装了”。
    【本报太岳八日电】沁水武委会为拿出一切力量投入大反攻，现已开始整理与建立民兵野战连。并获得如下经验：一、行政命令做不通。过去三区整理组织，曾经进行了三四次，但由于干部怕麻烦爱简单，“一纸命令往下传，那个胆大不听言”，不管枪支多少，人数多少，也不管是什么人，糊里糊涂编起来就算完事，从表面上看去还整齐，但在几次远征中却不断发生问题。一些地主的儿子和兵痞流氓乘机破坏群众纪律，活动开小差，如张村民兵远征河津时，即因此逃跑了四个。一区南阳村去年整理组织时，少数干部和积极分子裸体跳舞，脑子一热，就规定了几个条件：一、年龄在十八岁以上三十五岁以下。二、身体强健（有点小病也不要）。三、要有军衣和军鞋袜。四、打过仗，有经验，打枪有准。这样组织了十个人的一个班，尽是一些地痞流氓和地主儿子，其他所谓不合格的正是贫雇农。他们做不起军衣，不会说漂亮话，就没有组织起来。地主兵痞们组成的野战民兵，每天游手好闲，跃武扬威，大家反对。（二）必须走群众路线。这次组织整理中，克服了行政命令作风，走群众路线，获得很大成绩。二区张村，首先召开民兵班长、互助组长和各系统干部会议，研究了整理的方式和具体办法，然后在各民兵班和各互助组里酝酿，进行群众性的审查民兵成分和表现，再把各组的意见交给村常委会研究，综合起来，再让大家研究。经过这样酝酿审查，提出了六个斗争对象和两个兵痞子不能参加民兵，并且说“这些人每天嫖女人不劳动，在村穿上军衣背上枪逛来逛去，吓唬老百姓，出发时不是装病，就是要盘费，就不象咱自己的武装”。经过群众揭发，就在大众黑板上公布，让群众处理，又经过大家讨论把六个斗争对象全部开除，兵痞暂且留作候补民兵，等他们转好时再正式参加。张登弟虽不是斗争对象，但有破坏群众纪律，活动开小差等，亦被群众开除了。至此，群众开始觉得民兵是自己武装了。
