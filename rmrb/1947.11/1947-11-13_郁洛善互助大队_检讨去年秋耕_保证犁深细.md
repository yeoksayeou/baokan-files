[Report from our Jinnan office on the 10th] The Yu Luoshan Mutual Aid Team in Xishageda Village, Ji County, after completing the wheat planting and threshing of over 700 mu of land, immediately convened a meeting of mutual aid group leaders to review last year's autumn plowing and plan this year's autumn plowing methods. Everyone spoke enthusiastically. Changming said, "This year's autumn plowing must be taken seriously, not as carelessly as last year. Last year, our village mobilized all the livestock and people, without calculating work points, and some people suffered losses." Lieshi said, "Last year, it took half the morning to gather everyone for autumn plowing, and we didn't do much work in the fields, wasting a lot of livestock and manpower." Dazhang said, "Last year, the cadres didn't effectively supervise and the inspection wasn't thorough. The plowing was shallow and rough, and as a result, everyone was dissatisfied." Zhengji said, "Last year, I plowed my four mu of land myself, and it was very good. But when I plowed land for others, it was rough and shallow." He also said, "Last year, we also plowed more than ten mu of land for the landlord Liu Zhusan, which took more than three days. Look how much we lost." Jinbang said, "I have more than three mu of land in the southwest of the village, which I plowed myself carefully and deeply. This year, the seedlings took hold, and I harvested eight bags of grain. In the north of the village, I have two mu and seven fen of land, which I plowed after the New Year. I sowed several times, but the seedlings didn't come up completely, and I only harvested four dou of grain. Autumn plowing is better." Lao Shan said, "Everyone has raised a lot of opinions and experiences about last year's autumn plowing. The main reason for the failure was that I didn't discuss it with everyone. Let's discuss how to do autumn plowing this year." Everyone spoke enthusiastically. Lao Shan summarized everyone's opinions and said, "This year's autumn plowing should be deep and detailed, ensuring no unplowed land. Mutual aid groups should be the units, adjusting manpower and animal power for exchange labor. Women should grind flour, saving livestock for autumn plowing. Groups that can't finish plowing should be helped by groups that have finished." Finally, Lao Shan also proposed, "In order to plant cotton well next year, after plowing the land, let's turn it over again, and be sure to plow deeply and carefully." Everyone responded enthusiastically. The group leaders continued to lead their groups in autumn plowing. Children gathered firewood and pulled grass, and women were busy making winter clothes. In an eleven-day blitz, 622 mu of autumn land were plowed once, and 92 mu of cotton land were also turned over, all plowed deeper and more carefully than last year. There are still 713 mu of peanut and sweet potato land that have not been plowed. In the last two days, the groups are digging yams and harvesting peanuts, preparing to continue autumn plowing.

    检讨去年秋耕
    保证犁深细
    【本报冀南十日电】冀县西沙疙瘩村郁洛善互助大队，完成七百余亩种麦与打场后，即又召集各互助组长会，检讨去年秋耕，计划今年秋耕办法。大家热烈的发言，长明说：“今年秋耕可得认真，别象去年那样马虎。去年咱村是所有牲口、人都动员，也不计工，有的就要吃亏。”列师说：“去年秋耕时全要半晌午才集合齐，下地也作不多的活，浪费好多牲口力、人力。”大掌说：“去年秋耕干部不实际督促，检查不深入，耕的浅又粗，结果大家都不满意。”正吉说：“去年我的四亩地自己耕的，很好。可是我给别人耕地时，耕的又粗又浅。”又说：“咱去年还给地主刘竹三耕了十几亩地哩，费了三天多工夫，你看咱吃多么大亏。”金榜说：“村西南我有三亩多地，我自己耕的又细又深，今年拿住了苗，打了八布袋谷子。村北二亩七分地，我过了年才耕的，耩了好几回，结果苗出不全，只打了四斗谷子，还是秋耕好。”老善说：“对去年秋耕大家提了好多意见与经验，主要我没和大家商量，所以失败。咱今年讨论如何秋耕吧。”大家你一言我一语又热烈发言；老善将大家意见总结说：“今年秋耕要深耕细耕，保证没生地，以互助组为单位，调剂人畜力换工。妇女推磨碾，省下牲口秋耕。那组耕不完，耕完组去帮助。”最后老善又提出：“咱们为了明年好种棉花，把地耕好后再翻一个过，一定要深耕细作。”大家一致响应。各组长继续带领各组秋耕。儿童拾柴拨草，妇女忙做冬衣，各组在十一天的突击中，六百二十二亩秋地耕了一遍，九十二亩棉花地也已翻过来，都比去年耕的深又细，还有七百一十三亩花生、红薯地没耕。近两天各组正挖山药、弄花生，准备继续秋耕。
