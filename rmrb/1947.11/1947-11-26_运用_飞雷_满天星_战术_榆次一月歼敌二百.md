Employing "Flying Thunder" and "Starry Sky" Tactics
　　Yuci Annihilates 200 Enemies in One Month
[This newspaper's Taihang dispatch of the 24th] The military and civilians of Yuci advanced behind enemy lines to protect the autumn harvest and farmland. From the beginning to the end of October, they engaged in 21 battles, detonated 213 landmines, killed, wounded, and captured 224 enemy soldiers and puppet troops, seized 2 rifles, 65 bullets, 3 grenades, 8 livestock, 3 carts, 10 *shi* of grain, and some other supplies. We suffered only two casualties. The experiences of the past month are as follows: (1) The battalion soldiers and militiamen closely cooperated, acted in a unified manner, and proactively penetrated behind enemy lines to launch political offensives, making it difficult for the enemy to understand our situation for a long time. They guarded their strongholds and dared not come out, allowing us to smoothly complete the autumn harvest. (2) Joint defense operations combined with explosions shattered the enemy's "water inundation" grain grabbing tactics. When the enemy's Eighth Column, combined with 2,000 landlords, went to the Changning area to seize grain, the joint defense of the militiamen from five villages, including Changning, set up a large minefield in coordination with the armed work team, combined with sniper fire, preventing the enemy from entering the village for three consecutive days, and instead annihilating 52 of them, causing a great rout. (3) Launching the "Flying Thunder" movement, shifting from landmine defense to landmine offense. The Zikeng militiamen once buried five mines at the base of the Guo Village blockhouse, using sniper fire to lure the enemy out. All the flying thunder mines were stepped on, killing and wounding six enemies. The blasting expert Tian Changhong buried a mine at the base of the Shuangcun blockhouse, wounding the leader of the plainclothes team and two others. (4) Using plainclothes against plainclothes, employing the "Starry Sky" plainclothes tactics to carry out capture operations behind enemy lines, greatly threatening secret agents and landlords. Within a month, a total of 43 plainclothes agents, secret agents, and landlords were captured. Due to the development of the capture battle, the enemy's scattered personnel dared not wander around casually, creating a favorable situation for our staff to carry out work in the enemy area. (5) Circling around behind the enemy's main force, specifically targeting the enemy's grain grabbing teams. The enemy's column of over a thousand people went to Changning for three consecutive days to seize grain. Our Fourth District Armed Work Team grasped this pattern and, as soon as the enemy's main force reached east of Changning, quickly turned to the enemy's rear, suddenly attacking a small group of enemies in Baida Village. Within ten minutes, they wounded four enemies and seized one mule, two donkeys, one cow, two carts, and more than ten sacks. When the enemy's main force returned, the militiamen had already moved away.
