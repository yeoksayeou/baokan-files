Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. The movement of the people in the Chiang-controlled areas to resist Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous and dictatorial rule has been rising daily. The peasants' armed struggle has become the main form and main force of the patriotic and democratic people's movement in the Chiang-controlled areas. The People's Armed Forces in South China and Jiangnan have recently launched a major offensive in coordination with the People's Liberation Army's overall counter-offensive. The Guangdong People's Armed Forces once cut off the Guang-Jiu Railway, the supply line for US aid to Chiang, on September 3, and then dispatched a thousand people at the end of October to attack Shenzhen, an important stronghold on the railway. The Yue Nan People's Armed Forces also launched a major offensive near Guangzhou Bay in the latter half of last month, engaging in a week of fierce fighting with the Chiang bandits' navy, security forces, and police. The People's Liberation Army, under the command of General Feng Baiju on Hainan Island, has been constantly attacking the important port city of Haikou and the county towns of Qiongshan and Danxian since September. The Jiangnan People's Armed Forces, in September, captured towns such as Jingxian and Maolin in southern Anhui, and in October, cut off the Jing-Hang and Hang-Hui highways, and constantly launched attacks in Nanhui, Fengxian, and Chuansha counties near Shanghai. These actions have left the Chiang bandits, with their insufficient troops and empty rear, exhausted.

The People's Armed Forces rising in Chiang Kai-shek's rear are developing vigorously. Jiangnan has recovered to the state before the New Fourth Army was ordered to withdraw from the area the year before last in order to strive for national peace. As for the People's Armed Forces in Fujian and Guangdong (including Hainan Island), they are now stronger than at any time in the past. The improvement in quality is particularly obvious: the command of the troops in Jiangnan and South China is becoming more unified, and tactically, they universally implement the policy of continuously annihilating small groups of enemies to strengthen themselves. In the political aspect, the People's Armed Forces have universally led the masses to establish people's power; Hainan Island has established a democratic provincial government, the Guangdong-Guangxi border region government is being planned between Guangdong and Guangxi, and people's county governments have been established in Lianjiang and Hua counties. The rural governments controlled by the people of Nanxiong in northern Guangdong have reached more than twenty townships. The counties in the Siming Mountains in Zhejiang have established the Eastern Zhejiang Administrative Office and a number of county governments. The People's Armed Forces in various places universally implement the policy of opening granaries to relieve the poor, distributing more than a thousand piculs of grain at one time in Maple Leaf Town, Putian, Fujian. The slogans of severely punishing corrupt officials, opposing conscription and grain requisition are widely put forward in various places. The Jiangnan and South China People's Armed Forces have implemented rent and interest reduction policies wherever they operate. There, the armed struggle has been combined with a broad mass movement.

  　江南农民武装壮大
    已恢复至新四军撤出前态势
  　华南民军筹建粤桂边区政府
    【新华社陕北十日电】蒋管区人民反抗蒋介石卖国独裁统治的运动，已日益高涨。农民的武装斗争，已成为蒋管区爱国民主人民运动的主要形式和主力军。华南及江南人民武装最近配合人民解放军的全面反攻，实行大举出击。广东人民武装于九月三日一度切断美国援蒋之补给线广九铁路，复于十月底出动千人进击该铁路上之重要据点深圳。粤南人民武装于上月下旬亦在广州湾附近大举出击，与蒋匪海军、保安队、及警察激战一周。海南岛冯白驹将军所部人民解放军自九月以来不断进攻该岛重要港口海口市及琼山、儋县等县城。江南人民武装则于九月间攻克皖南泾县及茂林等城镇，十月间复斩断京杭及杭徽两公路，并在上海附近之南汇、奉贤、川沙等县不断出击。这些行动兵力不足，后方空虚的蒋匪疲于奔命。
    崛起蒋介石后方的人民武装正在蓬勃发展，江南已恢复至新四军前年为争取全国和平而奉命撤出该地区前之态势，至于福建、广东（包括海南岛）人民武装则已较以往任何时期更为强大。素质的提高尤为明显：江南及华南的部队，指挥日趋统一，战术上普遍实行不断歼灭小股敌人，壮大自己的方针。在政治方面，人民武装已普遍领导群众建立人民政权；海南岛已设立民主省政府，粤桂间正筹设粤桂边区政府，廉江、化县已设人民的县政府，粤北南雄人民掌握的乡村政权达二十余乡镇。浙江四明山区各县已成立浙东行政公署及若干县政府。各地人民武装普遍实行开仓济贫，在福建莆田枫叶镇一次即分谷千余石。各地广泛提出严惩贪官污吏、反对征兵征粮口号。江南、华南人民武装活动所及已实行减租减息政策。在那里，武装斗争已与广泛的群众运动结合起来。
