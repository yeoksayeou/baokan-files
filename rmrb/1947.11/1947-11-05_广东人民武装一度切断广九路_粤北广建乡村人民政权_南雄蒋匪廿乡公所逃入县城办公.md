Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. The Guangdong People's Armed Forces once cut off the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, rural people's political power has been established in northern Guangdong, and offensives have also been launched in southern Guangdong. According to a Guangzhou dispatch from the Associated Press on the 31st, citing news from the Chiang bandit Guangdong Provincial Government Information Bureau, the people's armed forces in southern Guangdong are "seriously harassing" and are closing in on Guangzhou Bay, engaging in fierce battles with Chiang bandit naval forces, security teams, and police for as long as a week. Another report in the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao on October 13 revealed that on October 9, a unit of over 300 people from the people's armed forces in southern Guangdong, carrying steel cannons, machine guns, and other weapons, attacked the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. At Wuyong and Xiancun stations, 24 kilometers from the Dashatou Railway Station in Guangzhou, they engaged in fierce battles with a company of Chiang bandit troops and many military police. Chiang bandit trains to and from were forced to stop. The people's armed forces in Lechang and Nanxiong in northern Guangdong are active, and a certain unit in Nanxiong County has grown to over 1,000 people. More than 20 Chiang bandit township offices in the county have fled into the county seat to work, and the rural political power has been taken over by the people. Furthermore, according to a reader's letter published in the Hong Kong Masses Weekly on September 11, "In the rural areas of various counties on the border of Guangdong and Jiangxi, many have broken away from the rule of the Chiang regime, are self-reliant, implementing rent reduction and interest reduction, providing famine relief, and living a stable and progressive life." Note: The People's Armed Forces of northern Guangdong fought against the Chiang bandits twice in Heping and Yingde in July and August, winning both victories. In the battle of Qingtangxu in Yingde, more than 60 Chiang bandit battalion commanders and county magistrates were killed or wounded, and a great deal was seized. The reactionary armed forces of the Chiang bandit Wengyuan County Government were also severely attacked by the people's armed forces on August 17. A hundred or so people from the Chiang bandit self-defense joint defense team revolted in August under the "surrender movement" of the people's armed forces. As a result, the prestige of the people's armed forces was greatly enhanced, and people's political power was established in the rural areas of various counties.

    南雄蒋匪廿乡公所逃入县城办公
    【新华社陕北三日电】广东人民武装一度截断广九路，粤北已建立乡村人民政权，在粤南亦举行出击。据合众社广州三十一日电引蒋匪粤省府新闻局消息透露，粤南人民武装“骚扰甚剧”，直逼广州湾，与蒋匪海军、保安队及警察激战达一周之久。另据十月十三日沪大公报透露：十月九日粤南人民武装某部三百余人，携钢炮、机枪等武器，进袭广（州）九（龙）铁路，于距广州大沙头车站二十四公里的乌涌、仙村两站，与蒋匪一连及宪警多人激战，蒋匪来往列车纷纷被迫停驶。粤北乐昌、南雄人民武装活动频繁，南雄县境某部已发展至千余人。该县二十余蒋匪乡公所均避入县城办公，乡村政权遂归人民控制。又据九月十一日出版之香港群众周刊载读者投书称：“粤赣边境各县的农村，很多已摆脱蒋政权的统治，自力更生，实行减租减息，救济饥荒，过着安定向上的生活了。”按：粤北人民武装七八月间连续在和平、英德两次与蒋匪作战，均获全胜。英德青塘圩之战，并毙伤蒋匪营长、县长以下六十余名，缴获甚多。蒋匪翁源县府反动武装，又于八月十七日遭人民武装痛击。蒋匪自卫队联防队等一百余人，八月间于人民武装之“招降运动”下起义，于是人民武装声威大震，各县农村纷纷树立人民政权。
