　　Train Poor Women to Develop Winter Spinning
  　Xingtai Fifth District Inspects Textile Production
    [This newspaper, Xingtai] The Xingtai Fifth District convened a meeting on November 7th with over 300 people, including impoverished farm women and cooperative cadres from across the district. Reviewing the textile production of the past year, it became clear that the failure to follow the impoverished farm worker line from top to bottom hindered the development of textile production. Among the 120+ women trained by the district cooperative, over 40 were from landlord families. After returning to their villages, they did not properly teach the masses but instead sabotaged textile production. In Dong Shaolan Village, a landlord woman acted as a teacher, only leading women to dance on the roofs and colluding with hooligans to learn corruption, causing dissatisfaction among the masses with textile production. Women in Da Jia Village said that the leader of weaving was a "worn shoe," and families were unwilling to let their daughters learn from her. Most cooperatives had landlords within them, who specifically attacked women engaged in textile production. Women in Huangdian Village said that the manager of their village cooperative, Wu Dexiu, gave less cotton to impoverished households who had been liberated, and demanded excess when they handed in yarn; landlord women received more cotton, and even got credit for more than they turned in. His wife, when grading yarn, graded the top-quality yarn of liberated women as second-rate, and the second-rate yarn of landlords as top-quality. After the review, the women and cadres at the meeting proposed to organize the truly oppressed impoverished farm women to engage in large-scale textile production in the future. In the northern half of the district, where the harvest was good, textile production would lead to prosperity; in the southern half, where the harvest was poor, textile production would help overcome famine. The district cooperative will hire teachers in the old liberated areas and dispatch strong cadres to help train liberated impoverished farm women on a large scale to improve their skills and become the core leaders of textile production. Village cooperatives will prepare raw materials. Most villages have set plans for everyone to spin cotton and every family to weave cloth, striving to avoid buying cloth next spring and completing the goal of producing 100,000 jin of cloth. (Zhi Qi, Tong Sheng)
    [Another Dispatch] The Second District of Xingtai County convened a meeting of male and female cadres and activists on the 6th of this month. They reviewed that women across the district played a significant role in this year's agricultural production, but textile work this spring was not very good, due to insufficient leadership assistance. The composition of the women trained was also complex, and some did not play a good role after returning to their villages. For example, the women's chairman of Bei Guo Zhuang Village said: "The former chairman of our village, whose maternal family was targeted for struggle, did not teach others to spin. Besides visiting her mother's house, she brought opera scripts and Yangge dances to the textile group, causing the masses to complain that the textile group had become a small theater. This time, I will resolutely remove her and ensure that we do a good job." Subsequently, the county committee summarized and pointed out that the working principle in the future must be to comprehensively organize and develop textile production. During the 200-day textile movement this winter and next spring, the entire district must strive to complete 320,000 jin of cloth. In textile production, we must strive for female heroes and champions, and each village must set textile plans. Slogans were proposed: "To become prosperous, weave cloth and spin cotton!" "Learn to spin and weave to compete for heroism, earning respect for your family." (Jin Qing)

　　训练贫妇开展冬纺
  　邢台五区检查纺织
    【本报邢台讯】邢台五区十一月七日召开全区翻身贫雇妇女、及合作社干部等共三百余人会议。回顾一年的纺织，明确了自上而下不走贫雇路线，纺织没有开展起来。区合作社训练的妇女一百二十多人中，就有四十多个地主成份的，回村后，不好好教群众反而破坏纺织。东绍兰村地主妇女当教师，光领导妇女在房上跳舞，勾结流氓学腐化，造成群众对纺织不满意。大贾乡村妇女们说：领导织布的是“破鞋”，家里不愿叫学。大部合作社都有地主在里边，专门打击纺织妇女，黄店村妇女说他村合作社经理吴德秀，领棉花翻身户少给，交线得脱秤；地主妇女领棉花多给，交线还涨数；他老婆评线，把翻身妇女的头等线评成二等，地主的二等线评成头等。经过检讨以后，到会妇女及干部提出今后把真正受压迫的贫雇妇女组织起来，大量纺织。北半区年景好纺织要发家致富，南半区年景不好，纺织要渡灾荒。区合作社在老区聘请教师抽出强有力干部帮助大量训练翻身雇贫妇女提高技术，成为纺织领导核心。村社准备原料。大部村庄订出计划，人人纺花家家织布，争取明春不买布，完成十万斤布的要求。（芝岐、桐生）
    【又讯】邢台县第二区，本月六日，召开男女干部及积极分子会议，检讨全区妇女对今年地里的生产起了很大作用，但今春纺织工作不很好，原因是领导上帮助不够。训练的妇女成份也很复杂，有些回村没起好作用。如北郭庄妇女主席说：“我村过去的主席，她娘家是被斗户，她不教别人纺织，除了走娘家外，在纺织组插上门唱戏本、扭秧歌，闹的群众反映说：纺织组成了小戏院，这次我回去坚决把她清出去，一定要搞好。”接着县委总结，指出了进行工作的方针今后必须全面组织起来，开展纺织，在今冬明春二百天的纺织运动中全区要为完成三十二万斤布来努力；在纺织中，要争取女英雄女状元，各村要订纺织计划。并提出口号“要想发家，织布纺花！”“教会纺织争英雄，自己发家人尊敬”。（晋卿）
