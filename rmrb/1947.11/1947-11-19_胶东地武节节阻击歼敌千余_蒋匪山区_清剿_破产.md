Xinhua News Agency, East China, 17th: Chiang Kai-shek bandits, deeply entrenched in the Jiaodong hinterland, launched a so-called "encirclement and suppression" campaign against the Kuangqi mountainous area on the border of Laiyang and Qixia, and the Aiyu mountainous area between Penglai, Huangxian, Qixia, and Zhaoyuan, starting in late October. This campaign has gone bankrupt under the severe blows of our local armed forces and militia. Starting on October 25th, Chiang Kai-shek's 54th Division (minus the 198th Brigade) and the 25th Division's 108th Brigade (minus the 322nd Regiment) invaded the Kuangqi mountainous area from the north of Laiyang. On the 28th, they occupied Qixia City and then invaded westward. Fearing encirclement and annihilation, they hurriedly retreated to the northeastern area of Laiyang. Another group of Chiang Kai-shek bandits, the 42nd Brigade of the Reorganized 8th Division and part of the 166th Brigade, simultaneously advanced southward from Huangxian City, invading the Aiyu mountainous area. This enemy encountered strong resistance from us from the 28th to the 30th. It was not until the 1st of this month that they advanced to an area more than 30 miles east of Zhaoyuan. In addition, the enemy's Reorganized 64th Division stationed in Lancun, northeast of Jiaoxian on the Jiaoji Railway line, also gathered more than 4,000 defeated troops and generals and invaded the southeastern area of Pingdu on the 29th. The enemy's Reorganized 54th Division's 198th Brigade in Pingdu City also moved southward at the same time, attempting to coordinate with the northern invading enemy and form an encirclement and joint attack against us. Our army used unexpected tactics to defeat the enemy. On the 27th, taking advantage of the enemy's emptiness in Laiyang City, we raided the city gate, capturing over a hundred enemies. We then swept through the enemy strongholds along the Yanqing Road, such as Shuigoutou, Sunshou, Xiagezhuang, and Weitian. On the 28th, we annihilated a company of the enemy's 54th Division 50 miles south of Qixia City, capturing over 50 enemies alive and destroying four vehicles. On the 31st, one of our units recovered Zhanggezhuang, southeast of Pingdu, cutting off the Pinglai Highway in one fell swoop. On the afternoon of the 1st, a regiment of Chiang Kai-shek bandits from the 198th Brigade in Pingdu City rushed towards Zhanggezhuang but were blocked by us in the Zoujiabozi area, ten miles east of Pingdu City, annihilating over 240 enemies and seizing a large amount of supplies. At this point, the enemy was greatly demoralized. The enemies who had sneaked into the Kuangqi and Aiyu mountainous areas were forced to retreat to Laiyang and Huangxian in a panic on the 1st. During the enemy's advance and retreat, they were attacked by us everywhere. According to incomplete statistics, from October 25th to November 2nd, in nine days, our local armed forces and militia killed, wounded, and captured a total of 1,270 enemies and captured seven strongholds.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 17th: Chiang Kai-shek bandits, trapped in Mianhua Mountain a few miles northeast of Weihaiwei, sent a company of troops to the Sunjiatuan area on the 8th to loot grain. They were severely attacked by our Weihai garrison, resulting in 57 killed or wounded. The remaining bandits fled back in disarray.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 14th: Delayed news: The explosive team of a certain district in Pingbei County, Jiaodong, coordinated with the main force in blasting operations, fully demonstrating the art of combining blasting with combat command. The team first established close contact with the 3rd Battalion of a certain unit of the main force. The battalion commander personally took the team's staff officer Pu and all the team cadres to the front to survey the terrain and discuss the area for laying mines, the number of mines to be laid, the route of withdrawal after laying the mines, and the provision of fire cover during mine-laying. On July 22nd, our main force fought with the enemy south of a certain mountain. The explosive team went to the pre-planned minefield to lay mines in groups. In three hours, a total of 217 mines were laid. The mines were not only well-laid but also easy to retrieve. The next day was rainy, so they tried to cover the mines with cowpea leaves to prevent moisture. On the morning of the 24th, the enemy began to advance towards Yangzhao Xibu. Our main force shifted westward and eastward to a certain high ground and made contact with the enemy, luring the enemy to penetrate deeper into the minefield. As soon as the enemy discovered our main force, they charged with a full company. When they stepped into the minefield, we immediately fired intensely. Landmines exploded everywhere under the enemy's feet, causing great chaos in the enemy's formation. All 120 men in the entire company were annihilated except for four who fled back. The next afternoon, our unit was stationed at a certain mountain. The enemy was one mile away from our position and had already made contact with our main force's outposts. Staff Officer Pu personally led ten team members, covered by a platoon from the main force, and ran 200 steps to the minefield to quickly lay 38 mines. The enemy discovered our plainclothes team and immediately attacked the direction of our mine-laying with two platoons. After one landmine exploded, the enemy panicked and scattered everywhere, constantly stepping on mines. In thirty minutes, a total of 30 mines exploded, annihilating the enemy's two platoons on the spot. The reason why the explosion had such power was mainly due to the close cooperation between the main force and the explosive team, and the unity of combat command. The main force fought, the militia fought, and the main force cared for the explosive handlers, and the explosive handlers cherished the main force. Secondly, the explosive team was bold and flexible, constantly putting forward motivating slogans, so they could complete their tasks even in tense situations.

　　胶东地武节节阻击歼敌千余
  　蒋匪山区“清剿”破产
    【新华社华东十七日电】深陷胶东内地蒋匪，自十月下旬起对莱阳、栖霞边界之旷旗山区与蓬、黄、栖、招之间之艾崮山区发动所谓“清剿”，在我地方武装与民兵严重打击下，已告破产。十月二十五日起，蒋匪五四师（缺一九八旅）及二十五师一○八旅（缺三二二团）由莱阳北犯旷旗山区，二十八日侵占栖霞城，旋西犯，恐被围歼，即慌忙退至莱阳东北地区。另路蒋匪整八师四二旅及一六六旅一部，同时由黄县城向南进犯艾崮山区。该敌于二十八至三十日间，连遭我有力阻击，至本月一日始进至招远东三十余里一带。此外，胶济线上胶县东北蓝村之敌整六十四师，亦纠集歼兵败将四千余，于二十九日北犯平度东南地区。平度城之敌整五十四师一九八旅，同时向南出动，图与北犯敌配合，形成对我包围合击。我军出奇制敌，于二十七日乘莱阳城敌空虚之际，袭入城关，俘敌百余，继即横扫烟青路上之水沟头、孙受、夏格庄、渭田等敌据点。二十八日，又于栖霞城南五十里处歼敌五四师一个连，生俘敌五十余，毁汽车四辆。卅一日，我某部一举收复平度东南之张哥庄，切断平莱公路。一日下午，平度城蒋匪一九八旅一个团奔向张哥庄，被我阻击于平度城东十里邹家泊子一带，歼敌二百四十余名，缴获甚多。至此，敌大为沮丧，窜进旷旗山区及艾崮山区之敌，均被迫于一日狼狈撤回莱阳、黄县。在敌进犯与退却途中，处处遭我打击。据不完全统计，自十月二十五日至本月二日九天中，我地武民兵共毙伤俘敌一千二百七十名，攻克据点七处。
    【新华社华东十七日电】困踞威海卫东北数里外棉花山之蒋匪，八日又派一连兵力到孙家疃一带抢粮，遭我威市守军痛击，毙伤其五十七名，残匪抱头回窜。
    【新华社华东十四日电】迟到消息：胶东平（度）北县某区爆炸队，配合主力爆炸，充分发挥了爆炸与作战指挥结合的艺术，该队首先与主力某部三营取得密切连系，营长亲自与爆炸队蒲参谋带着全队干部至阵前察看地形，商定埋雷地区，埋雷数量，埋好后从那里撤退，埋雷时以火力掩护等项目。七月二十二日，我主力在某山以南与敌人战斗，爆炸队即赴事先计划好的埋雷区分组埋雷，三个钟头共埋雷二百十七个，埋的既好，又易起出。第二天阴雨，即设法用豆角叶掩盖防潮。二十四日上午，敌开始向杨召西埠前进，我主力向西向东转移至某高地与敌接触，诱敌向雷区深入，敌一发现我主力，乃以全连兵力冲击，待其踏入雷区，我即以密集火力猛射，地雷在敌脚下到处开花，敌阵大乱，全连一百二十余人除四人窜回外，全部就歼。次日下午，我部驻某山，敌人离我阵地一里地，已与我主力前哨接触，蒲参谋即亲带十个队员由主力一个班掩护，跑二百步到埋雷区迅速将三十八个雷埋好，敌发现我便衣队，即以两个排兵力向我埋雷的方向攻击，一个地雷开花后，敌人惊慌失措，到处乱窜，总是踏响，三十分钟，共炸响三十个，敌两个排就歼阵前。爆炸能有如此威力，主要是由于主力与爆炸队之密切合作，与战斗指挥的统一，主力打，民兵打，而且主力关心爆炸手，爆炸手爱护主力。其次是爆炸队大胆灵活，随时提出鼓动口号，所以在情况紧张时，也能完成任务。
