Heshun County District Cadres Inspect and Rectify Financial Work
Correct the Tendency to Occupy the Fruits of Labor

[Report from this newspaper, Heshun] Village finances in this county are self-sufficient. As early as the spring mobilization production conference, this was proposed as one of the ten major production increases. The county and district cadres' meeting summarized on the 16th of last month that out of the 197 administrative villages in the county, only 40 villages truly followed the mass line, returned the fruits of labor seized from the masses, and reported a large amount of hidden assets to achieve self-sufficiency. The other 125 villages, although also self-sufficient, mostly encroached upon the fruits of labor. Thirty-two villages were not rectified at all. After the summary, the bureaucratic and muddled thinking of being irresponsible to the masses was criticized: First, not enough importance was attached to the rectification of village finances. It was thought that village burdens were trivial and not a demand of the masses. The 5th, 6th, and 7th districts examined and found that they put the instructions on a high shelf without studying them. The 4th district secretary thought it was the business of finance and grain cadres and did not personally take action. Second, complacency and lack of class viewpoint. Comrade Du of the 4th district said that when the higher-ups called urgently, he also shouted at the lower levels. When he heard that self-sufficiency was achieved, he became complacent, regardless of whether the source was correct. However, when he discovered that various places were encroaching on the fruits of the masses, he knew it was inappropriate but did not correct it. Comrade Ma Laibao of the 2nd district said: Shangzhuang did not allow the use of fruits of labor for village finances because of the poor and hired peasants, but he was still unaware and even complained about the village cadres. Many comrades examined themselves, thinking that it was the same anyway, using the fruits of labor instead of levying from the masses, thinking that using the fruits of labor was right. Therefore, 125 villages in the county harmed the interests of the poor and hired peasants, seizing the fruits of labor as village financial funds. Third, lack of confidence and disbelief in the masses. When the rectification of village finances was proposed, cadres generally thought there was no profit or anything to rectify, and the rectification of finances was weak. However, when villages such as Heshan and Zhaozhuangyu rectified large amounts of assets, the old view was broken. The experience of the 3rd district is that when the masses consciously rectify, the village finances can be self-sufficient. Fourth, a one-sided understanding of the rectification of village finances, thinking that simple economic self-sufficiency is the goal, not knowing that this is to mobilize the masses to understand their families' assets, recognize difficulties, and jointly manage the family. Therefore, at the beginning, they did not move because there was no profit, and then, under passive circumstances, a few cadres investigated and collected assets, for self-sufficiency for the sake of self-sufficiency, replacing and taking over, and as a result, they could neither achieve self-sufficiency nor mobilize the masses. After a deep criticism, it was unanimously believed that bureaucracy was at work, so they carefully studied the path of how Heshan and other villages mobilized the masses and were determined to carry out a mass rectification of village finances movement, truly handing over the finances to the masses and embarking on self-sufficiency.

    和顺县区干检查整财工作
    纠正占用果实偏向
    【本报和顺讯】本县村财政自给，远在今春动员生产大会时，即提为十大增产之一。上月十六日县区干部会议总结，全县一百九十七个行政村，只有四十个村真正走了群众路线，退还了占取群众果实，自报出大批隐藏资财做到自给。其他一百廿五个村，虽也有自给，但多侵占了果实。有三十二村根本未整。经过总结之后，批判了对群众不负责任的官僚主义和糊涂思想：一、对整理村财政重视不够。以为村负担扯蛋，认为不是群众要求。五、六、七区检讨出，把指示置之高阁不加研究，四区分书以为是财粮干部的事不亲自动手。二、自满与缺乏阶级观点。四区杜同志说，当上级喊的紧时，自己便对下级也喊起来，听到说自给了，便自满起来，不管来源是否正确。但当发现各地侵占群众果实时，明知不妥，也不纠正。二区马来保同志说：上庄因贫雇不让用果实做村财政，自己仍不自觉，还埋怨村干部。许多同志都检讨，以为反正一样，用了果实，不向群众派，以为用果实就对。故全县有一百二十五个村损害了贫雇利益，占夺了果实做村财政资金。三、缺乏信心不相信群众。提出整理村财政，各个干部普遍以为没油水、无物可整，整财不力。但当合山、赵庄峪等村整出大批资财时，打破了旧的观点。三区的经验是群众自觉起来整，则村财政便能自给。四、对整理村财政认识片面，以为单纯的经济上自给，便达到目的，不知到这是发动群众了解家当认识困难，共同起来当家管理，因此开始因没油水而不动，续则在被动情况下，少数干部调查、搜集资财，为自给而自给，代替包办，结果既不能自给，又没有发动了群众。深刻作了批判后一致认为是有官僚主义在作怪，便悉心研究了合山等村如何发动群众的道路，决心开展群众性的整理村财政运动，把财政真正交到群众手里走上自给。（和顺联合办公室桂林、拴林、世昌）
