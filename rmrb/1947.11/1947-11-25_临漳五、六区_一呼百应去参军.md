　　Linzhang Fifth and Sixth Districts
    A Hundred Responses to the Call to Enlist
    [Our Jinnan Dispatch, 23rd] In Xixu Village, Second District, Wei County, emancipated young men enthusiastically volunteered to join the army, with parents, brothers, wives, and the masses offering encouragement. After thorough discussions in small groups and family meetings, the village held a second mass meeting. Chairman Liu Zongyao shouted, "Old Chiang is about to fall, who will kick him to his end?" Before he finished speaking, young men jumped out of the crowd, shouting, "I want to do merit for the people, I volunteer to join the army!" Amid thunderous applause, a youth of seventeen or eighteen stood up and said, "It was honorable to volunteer at the last meeting, is it still as honorable today?" The masses responded, "Just as honorable!" So he shouted, "Count me in," and jumped out. In the encouragement and jubilation of the whole venue, twelve people signed up one after another. Everyone sat on a long bench. A group of female students, holding glorious flowers, approached the soldiers to the sound of melodious music, pinning a flower on each new warrior. Someone said, "It's just like marrying a new bride." The new soldier Liu Baogui said to the masses, "At the first enlistment meeting, I had already made up my mind, but why did I only jump out today? Because my parents hadn't made up their minds at that time. Later, I explained a lot to my parents, especially at the family meeting in the evening, which convinced my parents, and the whole family agreed, so I signed up today." Liu Haichen said, "I figured that it wouldn't work to just make up my own mind and go to the army. If the family doesn't agree, and my parents cry when I leave, I won't feel good, so I talked to my family in advance." Liu Zonghai and other comrades also said, "We won't return home until we capture Old Chiang." At this time, Liu Baogui's older brother, Baolu, said, "My brother is going to join the army today. I should have gone, but after yesterday's family meeting, my brother insisted on going, and asked me to stay at home and work hard in production." Liu Xiantu's older brother said, "My brother said he is not good at working at home, so he asked me to work at home and he will join the army. I guarantee to do more work so the family won’t have any problems." Liu Dejun's father said, "Dejun, you must capture Old Chiang alive and let the folks in the South also be emancipated." Everyone happily chatted and laughed, feeling very happy, and the meeting didn't end until after noon.
    [Our Jinnan Dispatch, 23rd] After the Linzhang Fifth and Sixth Districts held a meeting of 2,500 village cadres and activists, the masses in each village heard the news about enlisting in the army and rushed to sign up, with more names than could be written down. Everywhere people shouted, "Write me down." Villager Militia Wu Xishun, from Laoying Village, was about to get married, but he decided not to, saying, "Let's get married after defeating Old Chiang." Zhang Jinghua had only been married for a few days, and he insisted on leaving immediately. The brother and eldest son of the deputy director of the Farmers' Association in Xiji Village, Sixth District, had already joined the army eight or nine years ago. There was only a second son at home, and he was sent to the army as well. In Zhang Village, Fifth District, two brothers discussed it and both joined the army. Fifteen people from Huang Xin'nian Village took the stage and said loudly, "It doesn't count to do merit in the village, we are going to the front to do merit." Encouraged by this enthusiasm, the depressed villages also became active. The number of applicants in Hongshan Village increased from one to five. The number in Xianwang Village also increased to seven. The number in Dongji Village increased from two to seven, with unusually high morale. According to preliminary statistics, there are 114 people in the Fifth District and 124 people in the Sixth District. Among them, there are six pairs of brothers who went together. The number of applicants continues to grow.

　　临漳五、六区
    一呼百应去参军
    【本报冀南二十三日电】威县二区西徐村翻身青壮年踊跃参军，爹娘兄弟妻子群众倍加鼓励。经过小组讨论、家庭会议充分酝酿后，该村二次召开群众大会。主席刘宗耀高声喊道：“老蒋快完蛋，谁去把腿搬？”话还没停，只见一个个的青年从人丛中跳出来，高呼着：“我要为人民立功，我自愿去参军。”在掌声雷动中，站起了一个十七、八岁的青年，他说：“上一次大会上自动报名是光荣的，今天是不是还一样的光荣呢？”群众随声答道：“一样光荣。”于是他一面高喊着：“我算一份”，一面即跳了出来。在全场鼓舞欢腾中，相继有十二人报名。大家坐在一长板凳上。一群女学生拿着光荣花在悠扬乐声中走近了战士的面前，给新战士挂上一朵鲜花。有人说：“和娶新媳妇一样。”新战士刘宝贵向群众说：“在第一次参军大会上，我就打通了思想，但是我为啥至今才跳出来呢？因为我爹娘那时没有打通思想。后来我给俺爹娘讲了很多道理，特别是晚上开家庭会，打通了我父母的思想，全家都同意了，所以我今天才报了名。”刘海臣说：“我寻思着光自己打通思想就去参军是不行的，要是家中不同意，到走时爹娘一哭，我心里也不好受，所以我事先就和家里谈好了。”刘宗海等同志也说：“我们不捉住老蒋，誓死不还家。”这时新战士刘宝贵的哥哥宝路说：“我兄弟今天去参军，本应我去，经过昨天的家庭会，我兄弟坚决要去，叫我留在家里好好生产。”新战士刘先途的哥哥说：“我兄弟说他在家干活干不好，叫我在家干活，他参军。我保证更多做活，全家不作难。”新战士刘德俊的父亲说：“德俊，你要活捉住老蒋，叫南边的老百姓也都翻过身来。”大家喜笑言欢的说了好多话，人人都感到很愉快，一直谈到正晌午以后才散会。
    【本报冀南二十三日电】临漳五、六区于两千五百村干积极分子大会后，各村群众听说要参军，群起相随报名，一个一个的名字写都写不及，到处呼喊：“写上我。”老营村民兵武希顺最近就要结婚，也不结了，他说：“打败老蒋以后再结婚吧。”张景华才结婚不几天，定要马上就去。六区西冀庄农会副主任的兄弟、大儿都已参军八九年了，家里只有二儿，也送他参军了。五区张庄有一家兄弟二人商量好，一块参了军。黄辛年村十五人登台高声说：“在村里立功不算，我们到前方立功去。”在这种热情鼓舞下，消沉的村庄也活跃起来；洪善村有一个人报名增加至五名；显汪村也增至七名；东冀庄由两名，增到七名，情绪异常高涨。据初步统计，五区一百一十四名，六区一百二十四名。其中兄弟二人一齐去的有六名。现报名者仍接续不断。
