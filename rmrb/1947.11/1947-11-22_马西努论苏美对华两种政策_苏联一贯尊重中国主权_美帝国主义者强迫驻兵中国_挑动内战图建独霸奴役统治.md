Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. Moscow Radio broadcast Masinu's commentary on the two policies of the Soviet Union and the United States regarding China on the 15th. The full text is as follows:

According to newspaper reports, Molotov's report on the thirtieth anniversary of the Great Socialist Revolution deeply impressed a wide range of social figures in China. When Molotov spoke about the foreign policy of socialist countries in his report, patriotic and democratic figures in Chinese society paid particular attention to the significance of this part of the report. Socialist policy is a policy of peace and international cooperation. The Soviet Union has consistently followed such a policy in the past and present. The principle upon which this policy is based is respect for the sovereignty of all countries, large and small, and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. In contrast is the policy of American imperialism: denying the democratic rights of all peoples, trampling on the sovereignty of all nations, with the aim of ruling other nations by the United States. Chinese patriots pointed out that long ago, the Chinese people were able to prove the fundamental difference between socialist and imperialist policies based on their own experience.

Since the first day of its birth, the Soviet Republic has established relations with China based on the democratic principles mentioned by Molotov in his report. The first treaty signed between the Soviet Union and China (referring to the "Outline Agreement on the Settlement of Outstanding Issues between China and Russia" in May 1924) was the first international treaty recognizing equality with China and recognizing Chinese sovereignty, opening a new era in China's foreign relations and playing a significant role in China's struggle for independence. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, ratified on August 24, 1945, is another international treaty based on the same democratic principles of respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations and non-interference in their internal affairs, laying the foundation for relations with China. The Soviet Union believes that foreign countries should not interfere in China's internal affairs, that the Chinese people should handle their own internal affairs, and that foreign interference would hinder China's rejuvenation. Therefore, the Soviet government advocates the rapid withdrawal of foreign troops. Due to the Soviet government's efforts to respect the sovereignty of all countries, the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference in December 1945 adopted a resolution on the China issue. Unfortunately, only the Soviet Union implemented the Moscow resolution. They did so because this resolution conformed to the principles of their foreign policy and the principles of their policy towards China. Therefore, the Soviet Union voluntarily complied with the resolution of non-interference in China's internal affairs and completely withdrew its troops—the troops liberating Manchuria—on April 3 last year.

The actions of the United States are not like this. They not only do not implement the agreement they signed not to interfere in China's internal affairs, but instead strengthen this interference in China's internal affairs, provoke civil war in China, and provide extensive aid and support to the Kuomintang. The United States' actions of interference rely on its own military force—the continued presence of American troops in China. The continued presence of American troops in China violates the obligations assumed by the United States in the agreement signed in December 1945. This shows that the United States' participation in the agreement two years ago, recognizing that China must be unified and democratized, was insincere and hypocritical. China's unification and democratization are contrary to the United States' post-war plans, which attempt to establish domination over China and the world. Therefore, while the Soviet Union sincerely strives to remove obstacles on the road to China's rejuvenation, peace, and democracy, the United States, on the contrary, not only strives to preserve these obstacles but also strives to increase them. In the past two years, Molotov and other Soviet representatives have repeatedly raised the issue of the withdrawal of American troops stationed in China at international conferences, pointing out that this would lead to interference in China's internal affairs and hinder China's unification and peace. In February of this year, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov pointed out in his letter to Marshall that the realization of China's unification and democratization is the business of the Chinese people themselves. He pointed out that foreign interference in China's internal affairs, especially the participation of foreign troops in China's civil war, only expands China's civil war and makes the cause of China's unification and peace more difficult. He pointed out: Therefore, the Soviet government has always maintained a policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs in its relations with China. The Soviet policy continues to maintain the policy established by the October Revolution and the unchanging policy stipulated in the historically significant treaty of 1945. The American monopoly capitalists continue their policy of enslaving China, a policy recorded in the unequal treaties that the United States forced China to accept. In the post-war period, when American imperialism attempted to openly establish a hegemonic rule over China, the United States' plans for political and economic aggression and enslavement of the Chinese people were reflected in new treaties (referring to the Sino-American Commercial Treaty, etc.). According to these treaties, the sovereignty of the Kuomintang-controlled areas is completely transferred to the United States. However, these treaties were signed by a very small number of reactionaries based on violating the interests of the Chinese people. Patriotic and democratic figures in China refuse to recognize these treaties that enslave China and are intensifying their struggle against American imperialist aggression.

### 马西努论苏美对华两种政策　苏联一贯尊重中国主权  美帝国主义者强迫驻兵中国　挑动内战图建独霸奴役统治

　　马西努论苏美对华两种政策
  　苏联一贯尊重中国主权           
    美帝国主义者强迫驻兵中国
  　挑动内战图建独霸奴役统治
    【新华社陕北二十日电】莫斯科电台十五日广播马西努评论苏美在对华关系上的两种政策，全文如下：
    据报纸消息：莫洛托夫发表关于伟大社会主义革命三十周年的报告后，使中国广大社会人士发生深刻印象。莫洛托夫在报告中说到社会主义国家的对外政策时，中国社会爱国民主人士特别注意这部分报告的意义，社会主义的政策就是和平及国际合作的政策，苏联在过去和现在一贯的在遵行着这样的政策，这种政策所根据的原则，就是尊重大小国家的主权，不干涉其他国家的内政。与此相反的是美帝国主义的政策：否认各国人民的民主权利，蹂躏各民族的主权，以美国统治其他民族为目的。中国爱国人士指出：在很久以前，中国人民即能根据自己的经验，来证明社会主义的政策与帝国主义政策这种原则上的分歧。
    苏维埃共和国自从它诞生的第一天起，就根据莫洛托夫在报告中所说的那些民主原则建立了对中国的关系，苏联和中国签订的第一项条约（指一九二四年五月“解决中俄两国悬案大纲协定”），就是承认与中国平等，承认中国主权的第一次国际条约，给中国对外关系上打开了新纪元，在中国争取独立斗争中起了极大的作用。一九四五年八月二十四日批准的中苏友好条约，又是根据同样的尊重各民族主权与领土完整及不干涉他国内政的民主原则，奠定了对华关系之基础的另一个国际条约。苏联认为外国不应干涉中国内政，中国人民应该处理自己内部的事情，认为外国干涉会使中国的复兴事业遭受到阻碍，因此苏联政府主张外国军队迅速撤退。由于苏联政府努力尊重各国主权，一九四五年十二月莫斯科外长会议通过了关于中国问题的决议，可惜只是苏联执行了莫斯科决议，他们这样做是因为这个决议符合他们对外政策的原则，是符合他们对华政策之原则的。所以苏联自愿的遵守了不干涉中国内政的决议，而于去年四月三日将自己的军队——解放满洲的军队——完全撤退了。
    美国的行动却不是这样，他们不仅不执行其所签署的不干涉中国内政的协议，反而加强这种对中国内政的干涉，挑起中国内战，予国民党以广泛的援助和支持。美国的干涉行动，是依靠着自己的武力——美军留驻于中国。而美军继续留驻于中国，破坏了美国在一九四五年十二月签署的协定中所担负的义务。这表明了在两年以前美国参加协议，承认中国必须统一与民主化是不诚意的，是虚伪的。中国的统一及民主化是与美国战后计划相矛盾的，他们的计划是企图建立对中国及全世界统治，所以当苏联诚意力谋划除对中国复兴、和平及民主事业道路上的障碍时，美国相反的不仅努力于保存这些障碍，而且努力增加这些障碍，最近两年来，莫洛托夫和苏维埃其他代表曾在国际会议上，屡次提出撤退驻华美军问题，指出这会引起干涉中国内政，妨碍中国之统一与和平。今年二月苏外长莫洛托夫于其致马歇尔函中，指出实现中国的统一与民主化，是中国人民自己的事业。指出外国干涉中国内政，特别是外国军队参预中国内战，只是使中国内战扩大及使中国统一和平的事业遭受困难。他指出：因此苏联政府在自己的对华关系上，始终保持着不干涉中国内政的政策，苏联的政策继续保持着十月革命所建立起来的政策，和一九四五年记载于具有历史意义的条约中所规定的不变的政策。美国独占资本家则继续其奴役中国的政策，这种政策记载于美国强迫中国接受其所制定的不平等的条约上。在战后时期，当美帝国主义企图公开建立对华独霸统治时，美国在政治经济上侵略与奴役中国人民的计划，在新的条约（指中美商约等）上反映出来了。根据这些条约得将中国国民党区域的主权完全转交美国。可是这些条约是极少数反动派在违反中国人民利益的基础上所签署的，中国爱国民主人士拒绝承认这些奴役中国的条约，并加紧奋斗反对美帝国主义的侵略。
