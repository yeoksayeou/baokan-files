    Seize Every Inch of Receding Water to Plant!
    Forty-Eight Villages in Fan County's Riverbed
    Sowing Wheat Through the Mud After the Great Flood
    [Report from our newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area, dated the 3rd] After the Fan County Democratic Government provided loans to solve the wheat planting difficulties in the forty-eight villages in the riverbed, the masses enthusiastically rushed to plant. After the Chiang Kai-shek bandits released the water, autumn crops in the forty villages including Shi Wangye in the third district of the county were completely submerged, and the masses were threatened by a "spring famine". Some of the poorest people had nothing to eat after the flooding. The Democratic Government gave them special relief. Over the past three months, 1,326 poor households in 48 villages have received 27.3 million yuan in relief. In addition, 23.5 million yuan in production loans were issued. After receiving a loan, one group of people in Xiwangzhuang earned 183,500 yuan from selling salt ten times. Now that the great flood has passed and the wheat planting season is in full swing, the government has provided another 3.8 million yuan in wheat seed loans to solve the problem of wheat seeds (according to the local custom, wheat can be planted after the river water recedes, and the water only rises after the wheat harvest, so the riverbed residents mostly rely on one spring crop). Now the masses, adhering to the slogan of "act early, don't delay," are freely organizing mutual aid teams to pull the seed drills with great enthusiasm, in order to support the front line for the victory of the counter-offensive. In each village, they plant every inch of land as soon as the water recedes. Even when there is still mud on the ground, they tie wooden boards to their feet and start sowing wheat. Zhang Detian from Qianjun Zhang Village, because he lives close to the river, sowed wheat seeds twice on his six mu of land, but both times they were washed away by the water. Only the last time did the wheat seedlings finally appear. Currently, out of more than 500 qing of land in eight villages in the fourth district, 400 qing have been planted. In Shi Wangye Village, 13.5 mu have been planted out of 15 qing.

    水退一分抢种一分
    范县河床四十八村
    大汛已过涉泥种麦
    【本报冀鲁豫三日电】范县民主政府贷款解决河床四十八村的种麦困难后，群众热烈抢种。自蒋匪放水后，该县三区河床石王野等四十村，秋苗全部被淹死，群众都受着“春荒”威胁，一部分赤贫在水淹后就没有吃的，民主政府特予以救济。三个月来，四十八村、一千三百二十六户贫农，就得到二千七百三十万元的救济。另外，并发生产贷款二千三百五十万元。西王庄一组人得到贷款后，贩盐十次就赚了十八万三千五百元。现大汛已过，正当种麦季节，政府又贷麦种款三百八十万元，解决麦种困难（按河床水退后，即能种麦，麦收后水才上涨，河床居民多靠一春），现群众在“紧早不赶晚”，在为了反攻胜利支援前线的口号下，纷纷自由结合互助拉耧，情绪极高，各村都是水落出一分即种一分，地上还有淤泥时，他们脚上就绑木板即开始耩麦子，前军张村张德田，因离河身近，六亩地耩上两次麦种，都被水冲走，最后的一次才见麦苗。现四区八村五百余顷地中，已种上四百顷。石王野村十五顷地，就已种上十三顷五十亩。
