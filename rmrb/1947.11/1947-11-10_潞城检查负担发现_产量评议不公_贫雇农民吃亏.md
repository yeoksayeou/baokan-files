    Lucheng's Inspection of Burdens Reveals
    Unfair Production Assessment
    Poor and Hired Peasants Suffer
    [This newspaper's Lucheng dispatch] On the 21st of last month, the Lucheng County Government convened a meeting of over 700 village heads, political directors, heads of farmers' associations, and active poor and hired peasant elements to study the policy of autumn storage inspection burdens. After mobilization in the general meeting and individually, and group deliberation, Zhou Laiyun, an active poor and hired peasant element from Song Village, said: "When measuring land this spring, everyone said that middle peasants lost work and took advantage by choosing middle peasants to be the measuring team. They removed borders and embankments in the middle peasants' fields, but in the poor and hired peasants' fields, they calculated everything thoroughly. Of the 24 appraisers selected, 18 were old middle peasants. Old middle peasant Miao Heshun, with 51 mu of land, bore 6.6 points; new middle peasant Zhang Laizhen, with 21 mu of land, had to pay 14 points. Old middle peasant Cao Xiaohou, with 47 mu of land, had no points, while new middle peasant Miao Erhai, with 41 mu of land, bore 35 points." Village head Jia Yingshui from Shenzhuang Village said: "Our village selected several bankrupt landlords and three old middle peasants as appraisers. The farmers' association said they had spare time. For the same land, new middle peasants were assessed two to three dou more grain than old middle peasants. This summer, when handing in public grain, the landlord, with two family members, carried four shi of wheat in a small basket to hand in the public grain, while the poor peasant Lao Er'ao was impoverished, with no labor and no livestock, and had to borrow wheat along the street to hand in the public grain." Wang Sanping from Xiaoshan Village and active poor and hired peasant element Liu Wenke said: "Our village is dominated by middle peasants. Last year, handing in public grain was 'voluntary.' If the middle peasants didn't volunteer, they would ask the poor peasants to take the lead. As a result, the poor peasants all handed it in, but the middle peasants still didn't. This year, the production assessment was all decided by the old middle peasants. They would pass the poor people's doors with a quick word, but in their own fields, they would study it slowly." Zhang Youde, an active element from Nanchui, said: "In our village, of the 32 appraisers, 22 are old middle peasants. The best land is assessed at a maximum of 1.92 shi, but in reality, it can only produce 1.7 or 1.8. The worst land is assessed at 4 or 5 dou. These two types of land are generally in the hands of the poor. The middle-grade land is generally assessed at 7 or 8 dou to 1 shi, all in the hands of the old middle peasants, and the actual yield can reach two cloth bags (i.e., 1.5 shi or more), so the poor masses suffer in terms of burden." After inspection, everyone clearly understood the problems with the burden and found that the land yield in most villages was the same as what the active elements in Nanchui discussed, that is, the yield of middle-grade land should be low, and the acreage of middle-grade land was large and mostly owned by old middle peasants. This shows that the main problem of unfair burden is still the imbalance in production. After discussion, the reasons for the unfair production assessment were: (1) Cadres calculate small accounts but not large accounts. Some cadres feel that the newly emancipated households all have good land and high yields, and that the burden is heavy (which superficially seems like a poor and hired peasant line), so they lower the yield of good land. As a result of this lowering, the yield of middle-grade land is pushed even lower, and conversely, the burden of the newly emancipated masses is increased. In addition, many villages are controlled by old middle peasants, which intentionally or unintentionally promotes unfair production assessment. (2) Village-centrism: Some villages blur the class lines of the peasants and deliberately lower the production of their own village, thus lowering the middle-grade land even more. These villages generally start by assessing the good land, even raising a small amount of good land for grain quota land in order to compare with neighboring villages, while secretly lowering the middle-grade land in the village. In addition, appraisers use the account book for reference every year, which also benefits the old middle peasants and disadvantages the newly emancipated households. (3) The poor and hired peasants were not thoroughly mobilized. In the production assessment, there were erroneous understandings such as "being assigned a chore," "fearing delay of work," "lack of ability," and "looking for literate people." As a result, middle peasants and even special agent landlords took power. These appraisers did not proceed from the interests of the poor and hired peasants, nor could they properly assess the land based on soil quality and consideration of management conditions, but used a simple method of extrapolation from grain quota land.

    Secondly, the inspection found that there were also two shortcomings in the policy itself: (1) Generalization of population deduction. (2) Insufficient consideration for the newly emancipated. The administrative office stipulated that landlords and poor peasants should be deducted the same way. Middle peasants and above have more people, and new middle peasants have fewer people, so they suffer, while landlords generally deduct so much that they don't have to bear any burden. Regarding the land situation of the newly emancipated, in Lucheng, whether in new or old areas, the land acquired after the autumn of last year was small, especially in the new areas, most of the land changed hands after liberation until the autumn of last year. Although the land of these emancipated households has been in production for a year, the interior is empty and has not been filled up, while the old middle peasants have a solid foundation. Therefore, the newly emancipated still need to have deductions and considerations in terms of burden. The administrative office's decree stipulates that land acquired after the autumn of last year should be deducted by one-fifth of the due output, which is insufficient consideration. Regarding the above two issues, everyone conducted in-depth research, trial calculations, and determined new deduction and consideration methods, paying attention to caring for the poor and hired peasants, starting from the middle-grade land, and realizing the slogan of "raising production!"

    潞城检查负担发现
    产量评议不公
    贫雇农民吃亏
    【本报潞城讯】上月二十一日，潞城县府召开村长政治主任农会主席及贫雇财粮积极分子七百余人会议，研究秋屯检查负担政策。经过大会与个别动员及小组酝酿后，宋村贫雇积极分子周来运说：“今春丈地时，大家说中农误工少讨便宜选了中农捉丈弓，到中农地里除边除岸，到贫雇地里是澈头澈尾算，选了廿四个评议员，就有十八个是旧中农。旧中农苗和顺五十一亩地，负担六分六；新中农张来真廿一亩地，就出了十四分。旧中农曹小后四十七亩地没分数，新中农苗二孩四十一亩地就负担三十五分”。申庄村长贾应水说：“我村选评议员选了几个破产地主，三个旧中农，农会说他有闲工夫，同样的地，新中农就比旧中农多评二三斗粮食。今年夏季出公粮，地主二口人打了四石麦提上小篮交公粮，贫农老二凹穷的没劳力没牲口，沿街借麦交公粮”，小山庄王三平贫雇积极分子刘文科说：“我村是中农当权，去年出公粮是自动哩，中农不自动叫贫农先带头，结果贫农都出啦，中农也未出。今年评产量都是旧中农说话，到贫民门口一说就过去，到他们自己地上就慢慢研究开啦。”南垂积极分子张有德说：“我村卅二个评议员，就有廿二个是旧中农，好地最高评议一．九二石，实际只能打石七八，坏地评议四五斗，这两种地一般都在贫苦人手。中节地一般评议七八斗至一石，都在旧中农手，实产量可达两布袋（即石五几），因此贫苦群众负担就吃了亏。”经过检查，使大家明确了负担上的问题，发现土地产量上多数村是与南垂积极份子谈的相同即是中节地应产量低，而中节地亩数广又大半为旧中农所有，这说明负担不公主要问题还是在产量上不平衡，经讨论造成应产量不公的原因：（一）干部算小帐不算大帐，有些干部感觉新翻身户都是好地，产量高了负担重（从表面看来好象是贫雇路线），因此便降低好地产量，降低的结果，使中节地产量推的更低，相反的却加重了新翻身群众的负担。加以许多村旧中农掌握政权，更有意无意的促成了评议产量的不公。（二）村本位问题：有些村模糊了农民的阶级界线，故意压低本村产量，这样使中节地压低的更多。这些村一般是先从评议好地入手，以粮课地甚至把少数好地提高，以便与邻村对比，而暗地恰将村内之中节地降低。再加评议人员年年照帐推，结果也使旧中农沾光，新翻身户吃亏。（三）贫雇没有彻底发动，在评议产量中，产生了当支差、怕误工、没能耐、找认字的等错误认识，结果中农甚至特务地主当权。这些评议员不是从贫雇利益出发，更不能恰当的根据土质与照顾经营条件来评议，而是用以粮课地式从而下推的简单办法去做。
    其次便检查到政策本身的毛病也有两点：（一）是人口扣除一般化。（二）照顾新翻身不够。行署规定地主中贫农一样扣除，中农以上人口多，新中农人口少，结果吃了亏，地主则普遍扣的不负担了。关于新翻身土地情况，在潞城不论新老区，在去年秋后翻身，土地都是少数的，特别是新区，大部分土地是在解放后至去年秋前变动的，这些翻身户的土地，虽然经过一年的生产，但是内部空虚没有填起来，旧中农内部实在，因此新翻身在负担上仍有扣除照顾之必要。行署法令规定，去年秋后翻身所得之土地，扣除应产量五分之一，是照顾不够的。关于以上两个问题，都经过大家深入研究，试算，确定了新的扣除照顾办法，注意照顾贫雇，做法上从中节地提起，实现“产量提到”口号。（李文辅）
