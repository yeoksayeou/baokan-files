Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th. According to Shanghai newspaper reports, the anti-Chiang autonomous movement of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang has expanded from the northwest of the province to the Turpan Basin on the southern foothills of the Tianshan Mountains. Thousands of armed cavalry and infantry from the people of Toksun, Turpan, and Shanshan counties in the area have unified to form the "Turkistan Revolutionary Guerrilla Force," leading the local people to blockade Chiang Kai-shek bandit grain supplies and carry out the anti-Chiang struggle, putting forward slogans such as "Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops withdraw from Xinjiang" and "Implement national autonomy." In July, the guerrillas launched a major offensive, attacking strongholds and cutting off highways, winning continuous victories, causing panic in the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Xinjiang Garrison Headquarters. On July 6, more than 100 armed guerrillas first attacked the Chiang Kai-shek bandit police stations in Lianmuqin and Handun, Shanshan, annihilating all the bandit police and seizing many horses and guns. On the 10th, more than 600 armed men attacked Yanghai and Kumush on the Toksun-Kuerle highway. After entering Yanghai, they distributed more than 10,000 *shi* of grain stored in the bandit warehouse to the poor. On the 13th, more than 1,000 cavalry and infantry, carrying light and heavy machine guns and holding white "Turkistan Revolutionary Guerrilla Force" flags, under the direct command of the team leader Abudu Reheman, attacked the Chiang Kai-shek bandit fortress of Shengjinkou. The battle lasted four days and nights. The guerrillas charged repeatedly, their morale high, inflicting heavy blows on the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and completely destroying nearby telephone lines and highway bridges. At the same time, another powerful stronghold of Chiang Kai-shek bandits, Qijiaotai, was also attacked by more than 100 armed men of the team. In the major offensive, the guerrillas received enthusiastic support from the local people, and local personnel working in the Chiang Kai-shek county government also joined one after another. The guerrillas are now holding on to places like East and West Kekeyaer, strengthening their forces and continuing to fight the Chiang Kai-shek bandits.
