　　Black City Transport Team Earns Money to Buy Livestock
    [Our newspaper, Lincheng News] The Black City Transport Brigade in the Third District of Lincheng was established with the personal assistance of cooperation hero Liu Lianyin. When it was first established, some people said: We are still busy, we won’t participate. Some said: It’s too difficult to transport coal to Ludong, we won’t go, only a few households participated. Liu Lianyin said: The masses don't participate because they don't see the benefits of transportation. Let’s haul two trips first as an example to everyone, and they will participate. After hauling two trips, they earned a lot of money. Liu Lianyin immediately seized this example and held a meeting to educate everyone. By this time, the transport brigade had expanded to more than forty households. The first transport was hauling iron from Shicheng to Xingtai, which earned 180,000 yuan in one trip. The second trip was hauling coal from Jiaonigou to Gaoyi, with 18 transport vehicles earning 150,000 yuan in foreign currency per day. The third time, they hauled coal to Ningjin and brought back grain, with 20 vehicles earning 428,000 yuan in foreign currency per trip. They earned more than 1.5 million yuan in foreign currency for a total of five trips. Everyone's morale is very high, and they said one after another: "If Liu Lianyin hadn't organized us, how could we have earned so much money?" Now they are studying how to deposit the money they earned into the credit cooperative and prepare to buy livestock. (Zhen Wen, Zhan Ming)
    [Our newspaper, Xiyang News] In order to facilitate winter transportation, the county government instructed its subordinate units to repair main roads and renovate shops. It pointed out that all roads, large and small, should be repaired by the masses immediately after the autumn harvest. According to the areas under the jurisdiction of each district and village, the masses should be mobilized to build up the river embankments, build bridges, and fill in the missing parts. Regarding the renovation of shops and restaurants, it is necessary to get through the thinking of the people who run them, explaining that this winter's transportation is to overcome famine, dig up the roots of old Chiang Kai-shek, and the farmers of the world are one family, and they should not make excessive profits. Along the transportation arteries, the cooperatives of each district and village should set up transportation reception stations with certain funds and personnel in places where there are no shops, to facilitate the food and lodging of transportation personnel and animals.

　　黑城运输队赚钱买牲口
    【本报临城讯】临城三区黑城运输大队，是在合作英雄刘连音的亲自帮助下成立的。开始成立时，有的群众说：现在还忙哩，俺不参加。有的说：往路东拉炭路太难走，俺不去，只很少几户参加。刘连音说：群众不参加，是他们看不到运输的好处，咱们先拉两趟，给大家作个例子，他们就会参加了。拉了两趟赚钱很多，刘连音便抓住这个例子，马上开会教育大家，至此运输大队扩大四十余户。开始运输，是从石城往邢台拉铁，一趟即赚了十八万元。第二趟从胶泥沟往高邑拉炭十八辆运输车，一天赚洋十五万元。第三次去时，往宁晋拉炭回来拉粮食，二十辆车一趟赚洋四十二万八千元。共拉脚五趟，即赚洋一百五十万余元。大家情绪非常高涨，纷纷说：“不是刘连音组织咱，怎样能赚这多的钱呢？”现在他们研究把赚来的钱，存入信用社，准备买牲口。（振文、占明）
    【本报昔阳讯】为便利冬季运输，县府指示所辖修补大路要道，改造店房。指出所有之大小道路，在秋耕完后，应立即组织群众修好，应按各区村管辖地区，动员群众，将河冲的椿垒起，桥搭好，残缺的填补平。关于改造店房饭铺，要打通开设人思想，说明今冬运输为了渡荒，打老蒋刨老根，天下农民是一家，不应赚的利大了。沿交通大道各区村合作社，对没有设立店房的，应抽一定的资金人员开设运输招待站，以便利运输人畜的食宿。（忙小、志善）
