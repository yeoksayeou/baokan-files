Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th—The Indonesian anti-Dutch movement continues to flourish vigorously. On the 11th, Indonesian youth across the country held parades, demonstrations, and conferences in many cities to commemorate the second anniversary of the founding of the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the second anniversary of the Battle of Surabaya, protesting the Dutch military aggression. A resolution was passed at the Batavia conference: "Although Batavia is under Dutch military occupation, the youth of Batavia remain loyal to the Republic and demand the withdrawal of Dutch troops and unconditional recognition of Indonesia's freedom." All workers and employees in Batavia refused to work under Dutch rule and left the city after going on strike. Representatives of national independence movements in Borneo, Celebes, and Malacca recently held a meeting to protest the Dutch conspiracy to use a small number of Indonesian renegades to oppose the Indonesian Republic, demanding the immediate withdrawal of Dutch troops and stating: "The people of Borneo, Celebes, and Malacca remain loyal to the Indonesian Republic." The Indonesian Nationalist Party also decided at a meeting in Batavia to firmly demand that the Netherlands withdraw its troops and administration, and called for strengthening the defense of the Republic.
