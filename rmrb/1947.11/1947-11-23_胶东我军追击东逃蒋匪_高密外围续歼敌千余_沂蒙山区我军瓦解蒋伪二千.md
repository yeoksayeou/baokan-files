Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 21st: The People's Liberation Army, pursuing Chiang Kai-shek's bandits and pressing on the outskirts of Gaomi, continued to annihilate over 1,000 Chiang Kai-shek bandits in four days from the 14th to the 17th. From the night of the 14th to the 15th, the People's Liberation Army fiercely attacked Kangjia Village, Maojia Village, and other places northwest of Gaomi, annihilating over 300 Chiang Kai-shek bandits from the reorganized 54th Division, and recovered the aforementioned strongholds on the 16th. The remnants fled in disarray towards Gaomi City. On the same day, another unit of the People's Liberation Army routed a regiment of Chiang Kai-shek's reorganized 9th Division that had fled eastward from Lanjia Village north of Gaomi, killing or wounding over 600 enemy troops in Dujiapu (five miles east of Lanjia Village), forcing the remnants to flee back to Gaomi City. Another unit of the People's Liberation Army on the same day intercepted the 309th Regiment of Chiang Kai-shek's reorganized 8th Division, which was fleeing eastward from Gaomi City, east of Zhilanzhuang, killing or wounding a part of them, forcing them to flee back to their original position. On the 17th, remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's reorganized 64th Division in Gaomi City harassed westward and northward in four routes, but were all repelled. That evening, the People's Liberation Army also raided Wanjia Village, Laomutian, about five miles northwest of Gaomi, and the train station north of the city, trapping the Chiang Kai-shek bandits inside the city, afraid to go out. A total of over 1,000 enemy troops were annihilated in four days, together with the over 2,000 enemy troops annihilated in the blockade and pursuit between Gaomi and Weixian from the 6th to the 13th, totaling over 3,000 enemy troops annihilated. Further news: On the morning of the 18th, the front line had its first snow, and the People's Liberation Army fighters continued to besiege and strike the defeated enemy fiercely.

Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 21st: At about 10:00 a.m. on the 19th, the People's Liberation Army shot down a U.S.-made Chiang Kai-shek fighter plane on the outskirts of Gaomi City. The plane was forced to land twenty miles northeast of the city and was captured by the People's Liberation Army. The pilot, Sun Yonghua, was captured. According to his confession, the plane belonged to the Third Squadron of the 27th Detachment of the Fifth Group of Chiang Kai-shek's Air Force.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 21st: Over 1,000 men from a part of the 83rd Division of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, entrenched in Shijiusuo, Rizhao, fled south in three routes to Jiacang and Taoluo on the night of the 10th to loot grain, but were ambushed by our local armed forces and militia, killing or wounding over 60 of them, forcing the enemy to flee back to their original position. Our Qingdao Workers' Team is active in the enemy's rear near Qingdao, persisting in guerrilla warfare. In the sixteen attacks from September 26th to October 25th, they captured 178 enemy troops below the rank of battalion commander, and killed or wounded 74 of them.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 20th: Belated news: In the Luzhong Yimeng District, the masses launched the "Don't Forget to Save People After Overturning the Old Order" movement in September and October, dissolving 900 Chiang Kai-shek troops and 1,000 members of the "Returning Home Corps", and rescued over 7,000 people who had been deceived and forced to join, returning them home to divide the land and engage in production. The masses in the Yinan Bank Dike area made a "Life-Saving Pledge," allowing those who committed crimes to atone for their crimes with meritorious service, and those with major crimes could also atone for their crimes with great meritorious service, calling on them to take the opportunity to avenge themselves on the Chiang Kai-shek officers. Many Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, "Returning Home Corps" members, and deceived masses came over with their weapons, and even killed two wicked Chiang Kai-shek officers. Xu Shouyi, a villager from Dongchahe Village, Yishui, ran to the Chiang Kai-shek military residential area and called back 128 deceived masses after holding a "Save People's Meeting."
