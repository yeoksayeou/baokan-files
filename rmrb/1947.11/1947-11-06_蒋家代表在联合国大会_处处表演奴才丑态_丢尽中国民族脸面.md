Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st—Comprehensive reports: Since the opening of the UN General Assembly, the Chiang Kai-shek representatives, currying favor with their American masters, have been performing servilely at every turn, utterly disgracing the Chinese nation. On the issue of the veto power, Wang Shijie, in his speech to the UN General Assembly on September 18, blamed others for the "excessive use of the veto power," attempting to absolve the United States of responsibility for undermining the veto power. On October 2, the Chiang Kai-shek representatives went a step further and proposed amendments to the veto power for their American masters, treating many important international disputes as simple procedural matters and shamelessly advocating that "the five permanent members of the Security Council, individually or collectively, should renounce the use of the veto power on all procedural matters arising from Chapter VI of the Charter concerning the peaceful settlement of disputes." On the Greek issue, on October 1, Jiang Tingfu argued for his American daddy and his partners in distress, saying, "Some theories hold that the Greek problem originated from American and British aid to Greece, but the UN Charter or international law does not prohibit one government from assisting another government or accepting assistance from another government." He also said, "The Chinese (Chiang) delegation supports the American proposal on the Balkan issue." On October 15, on the issue of establishing an "Interim Committee of the General Assembly," the Chiang Kai-shek representatives also supported the American proposal "conditionally." On October 24, in the discussion of the problem of warmongers, Jiang apparently even more openly defended the American warmonger Bullitt, expressing tearful gratitude for Bullitt's remarks in "Life" magazine calling for war against the Chinese people. He applauded, saying he "admired Bullitt's courage." At the same time, under the pretext of defending "freedom of speech," he strongly advocated rejecting the Soviet proposal on stopping war propaganda. Recently, on the Korean issue, the Chiang Kai-shek representatives have again assisted the United States in undermining the Moscow decision, advocating that the General Assembly resolve the issue instead of direct handling by the United States and the Soviet Union.

    蒋家代表在联合国大会
    处处表演奴才丑态
    丢尽中国民族脸面
    【新华社陕北一日电】综合报导：自联大开会以来，蒋代表奉承美国主子，处处表演其丢尽中国民族脸面的奴才丑态。在否决权问题上，王世杰于九月十八日之联大演讲中，以“否决权之过度使用”，嫁罪于人，企图替美国破坏否决权卸责。十月二日，蒋代表更进一步为美国主子提出了修改否决权的建议案，其中把许多重要的国际争端问题，都视为简单的程序问题，且无耻地主张“安理会五常任理事国个别或全体对于所有因关于争端之和平解决之宪章第六章引起之程序问题，均放弃援用否决权。”在希腊问题上，十月一日蒋廷黻为其洋爸爸和难兄难弟诡辩说：“若干理论认为希腊问题起因于美英援助希腊，然联合国宪章或国际法，均未规定禁止此一政府援助彼一政府，或接受他政府之援助。”又说“中国（蒋）代表团支持美国关于巴尔干问题之建议。”十月十五日在成立“联大临时委员会”问题上，蒋代表亦“有条件”的支持美国建议。十月二十四日，在战争贩子问题的讨论中，显然钧更公开为美国战争贩子布立特辩护，对布立特在“生活”杂志上号召对中国人民作战的言论，表示感激涕零，他拍手说他“钦佩布立特的勇气”。同时，以保卫“言论自由”为借口，力主拒绝苏联所提关于制止战争宣传的建议。最近，在朝鲜问题上，蒋代表又协助美国破坏莫斯科决定，主张由联大解决不由美苏直接处理。
