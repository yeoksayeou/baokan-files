    Taiyue Military Headquarters Instructions
    Intensify the Training of Militiamen
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch of the 4th] The Taiyue Military Commission Headquarters, in order to actively organize forces for a major counter-offensive, issued instructions on October 31st to its subordinate sub-commissions and county commissions to seize the opportunity after the autumn harvest to carry out reorganization work and launch military training. It first pointed out that the organization of field companies should be reorganized and supplemented. This work must pay attention to and achieve the following: 1. In the process of reorganization, development, and military training, it is necessary to clearly establish the ideology of the hired and poor peasant line. In particular, the leading cadres must be filled and controlled by hired and poor peasants. This is one of the most important keys to whether the militia can thoroughly become the armed force of the peasant class. 2. The reorganization of field companies must be carried out conscientiously and carefully to ensure that it is truly voluntary and reasonable. After joining the army, the cadres, militiamen, and weapons of the field companies must be quickly replenished, adjusted, and equipped. In the replenishment of personnel, overcome the tendency to organize according to the number of guns, prevent excessive "streamlining-ism," and avoid the two deviations of administrative orders and forced, indiscriminate compilation. In arranging the personnel, strive to facilitate management, training, and action, as well as solving the problem of mutual assistance in family production, and follow the principle that personnel and guns can be appropriately rotated. After the field companies are reorganized, they should be trained immediately. Field companies that do not need reorganization should begin training now. 3. Training is best conducted at the company level, and at least at the platoon level. The basic principle of military training is to learn what is needed. First, everyone should learn to use their own weapons, individual combat drills, and tactics. Counties bordering the enemy, such as Pingyao, Jiexiu, Lingshi, Huo County, Linfen, Anyi, and Meng County, should attach sufficient importance to explosives. In terms of politics, the study of organizational discipline, prisoner-of-war policies, and the eight-point proposal of the People's Liberation Army declaration should be strengthened. The Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention should be memorized and conscientiously implemented.

    太岳武总指示
    抓紧整训民兵
    【本报太岳四日电】太岳武委总会，为积极组织大反攻力量，于十月三十一日指示所属各分会、县会，抓紧秋垡后空隙，进行整理工作与开展练兵运动。首先指出要将野战连的组织加以整理和补充，这一工作中必须注意和作到：一、在整理发展中以及练兵运动中，必须明确建立雇贫路线思想，尤其是领导骨干，一定要由雇贫农充任掌握，这是民兵能否彻底成为农民阶级武装的重要关键之一。二、整理野战连工作必须认真慎重，做到真正的自愿合理，在参军后，野战连的干部民兵武器等，都必须迅速补充调整和配备，在兵员的补充上，克服按枪支多少编，防止过分的精干主义，和行政命令强制滥编的两种偏向。在编排时应力求便于管理训练及行动与解决家庭生产互助问题，人员和枪支能适当轮调开等原则。野战连整理好后，应予马上训练，不需整理的野战连，现在就进行训练。三、训练最好以连为单位，最低限度亦以排为单位，训练内容，军事方面的基本原则是用啥学啥，首先是每人学会使用自己的武器，单个战斗教练与战术。平（遥）、介（休）、灵（石）、霍（县）、临（汾）、安（邑）、孟（县）等接敌县，应足够重视爆炸，政治方面应加强学习组织纪律，俘虏政策，人民解放军宣言的八项主张等文件，应熟记三大纪律八项注意，并认真执行。
