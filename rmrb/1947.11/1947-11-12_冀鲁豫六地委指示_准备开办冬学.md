Sixth Prefectural Committee of Hebei-Shandong-Henan Issues Instructions

Prepare to Open Winter Schools

[Report from our Hebei-Shandong-Henan office on the 8th] The Propaganda Department of the Sixth Prefectural Committee of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, issued "Instructions on Opening Winter Schools This Year" on the 23rd of last month, calling on all counties to make full preparations as early as possible. (1) This year's winter school is situated in the context of the great land review movement after the autumn harvest and the nationwide great counter-offensive. It is necessary to carry out ideological mobilization through winter schools and give full play to the role of winter schools. The policy of winter schools is to focus on political education, emphasizing the integration of current central tasks. In terms of content, it mainly includes the education on emancipation during the great land review movement, using the victory of the great counter-offensive to excite and strengthen the masses' confidence in victory, and then production education, combining with practice to improve production mutual aid and lay the foundation for future production; (2) In terms of organizational leadership, it should be unified under the leadership of Party committees at all levels. In villages, the branch should be the core, unified under the leadership of the Cultural Committee. In terms of organizational form, the original production organizations (mutual aid teams, cellar spinning groups, well rope making groups, etc.) should voluntarily combine and enroll themselves. In terms of teaching leadership, the past method of simply punishing should be corrected. The teaching method should focus on small group discussions to correct and solve ideological problems. In literacy education, winter schools should be combined with the "little teacher" system in primary schools; (3) Regarding the issue of winter school teaching materials, no separate textbooks will be produced. The county newspapers of each county will set up a special winter school teaching material section, which will be published regularly and continuously. The village Cultural Committee can conduct winter school education according to the teaching materials and in combination with the situation in the village. County newspapers should have a sufficient number distributed to each village, and at the same time, the characters should be clear, the font should be easy to recognize, and the language should be easy to understand. In addition, regarding the source of teaching materials, the Propaganda Department of the Prefectural Committee will issue an outline for winter school teaching materials. The duration of this year's winter school is set at three months, from November 15th to February 15th. The wheat planting is nearing completion, and all counties should seize the time to make arrangements.

　　冀鲁豫六地委指示
    准备开办冬学
    【本报冀鲁豫八日电】冀鲁豫六地委宣传部，特于上月二十三日，发出“关于今年开办冬学的指示”，号召各县及早作充分的准备。（一）今年冬学是处在秋后大复查运动与全国大反攻的情况下，必须通过冬学进行思想发动，充分发挥冬学的作用。冬学的方针是以政治教育为主，着重结合当前中心工作，在内容上，主要包括大复查运动的翻身教育，以大反攻的胜利来兴奋坚定群众的胜利信心，再就是生产教育，结合实际将生产互助提高，打下今后生产的基础；（二）在组织领导上，要统一于各级党委。村要以支部为核心，统一于文委会领导。在组织形式上，要以原来的生产组织（互助组、地窖纺纱组、打井绳组等）自愿结合，自动入学。在教学领导上，纠正过去单纯处罚的办法。教学方式上应着重小组讨论纠正解决思想问题。在认字教育上，冬学要与小学的小先生制结合；（三）冬学教材问题，不另制课本，各县县报专门设一冬学教材，经常连续登载。村文委会就可依照教材结合本村情况，进行冬学教育。县报要有足够的数量发到各村，同时还要作到字迹清楚、字体好认、通俗易懂，另外，对于教材的来源，地委宣传部发一冬学教材提纲。今年的冬学时间，规定三个月，自十一月十五日起，至二月十五日止。目前种麦已快结束，各县要抓紧时机进行布置。
