Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st. The successive victories of the People's Liberation Army's counter-offensive have greatly encouraged students in the KMT-controlled areas. According to an article entitled "After the Start of School" in the Tianjin Yishibao on October 2nd: "A new phenomenon, like the attention of the entire society, is that the wall newspapers at the beginning of this semester are all uniformly drawing maps and discussing the 'Southern Front situation,' and they seem to be enjoying it. If students were previously considered to be involved in politics, now they are involved in military affairs."

After suffering arrest and slaughter by the executioner Chiang Kai-shek in the anti-American imperialism movement this spring and the anti-hunger, anti-civil war movement this summer, some students in the KMT-controlled areas have deeply felt during the summer vacation that they must go deep into the countryside and integrate with the peasants. According to an article entitled "Go to the Countryside" in the 31st issue of the Mass Weekly published in Hong Kong: After the anti-hunger and anti-civil war movements, the students were full of enthusiasm and unwilling to stay in Shanghai to be beaten and arrested. They realized that only by uniting with the people can they seek their own liberation. Some students from Jiaotong University abandoned their semester exams and returned to their hometowns in the Southwest, and some students from Jinan University went to eastern Zhejiang. Student unions of various schools mobilized students to go to the countryside and issued "Outlines for Work in the Countryside." In mid-July, when 27 students from Jiaotong University and other universities going to the countryside met on a ship leaving Shanghai, they launched anti-dictatorship propaganda in the fourth-class cabin, singing "Strange Songs" (songs in the Chiang area mocking Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship), and performing a one-act play about the tragic conscription of Chiang's bandits, which moved many passengers on the ship. The publication reported that students in the Chiang-controlled areas encountered some difficulties in the process of going to the countryside and integrating with the peasants, because most of them came from non-peasant classes and were persecuted by Chiang's bandits. However, they still firmly believe that the peasants are the main force of the Chinese revolution, and that they must closely integrate with the peasants to build a new China. They are overcoming difficulties and moving in this direction.

　　蒋区学生运动新方向
  　纷纷放下书本下乡去与农民结合争取解放
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】人民解放军大反攻的节节胜利，使蒋管区学生欢欣鼓舞。据十月二日天津益世报“开课以后”一文称：“一个新现象，象整个社会的注意一样，今学年的壁报一开头千篇一律都是画着地图大论其‘南线形势’，而且津津有味的样子。如果以前认为学生是涉及了政治，如今又涉及了军事。”
    经过今年春天反对美帝国主义运动，夏天反饥饿、反内战运动中遭受刽子手蒋介石的逮捕屠杀后，一部分蒋管区学生在暑期中已深感到必须深入乡村和农民结合起来。据香港出版的群众周刊三十一期“下乡去”一文报导：反饥饿、反内战运动后，学生们热血沸腾，不愿意呆在上海挨打和被捕，他们认识了只有与人民结合起来才能求得自身的解放，交大一部分学生放弃学期考试回西南老家去，暨大一部分学生到浙东去。各校学生自治会发动学生下乡，并印发“下乡工作大纲”。七月中，交大下乡学生二十七人和其他大学下乡学生，在驶离上海的一条船上碰头的时候，就在四等舱内展开了反独裁的宣传，高唱“古怪歌”（蒋区人民嘲讽蒋匪独裁的歌曲），演出独幕活报蒋匪“征兵惨剧”，感动了船上许多乘客。该刊报导：蒋管区学生在下乡与农民结合的过程中，由于他们多数出身于非农民阶层和蒋匪的迫害，曾遇到若干困难。但他们仍坚信农民是中国革命的主力军，必须与农民紧密结合才能建立新中国，他们正踏破困难，朝着这个方向前进。
