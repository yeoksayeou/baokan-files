Water the Fields Well This Winter for Early Seedlings Next Spring
　　A District in Pingxiang Digs Ditches to Irrigate Fields

　　[Our newspaper's Jinan dispatch on the 24th] A district in Pingxiang is digging ditches to irrigate fields. Last winter and in January and February of this year, six or seven villages, including Guoqiao and Dadongguan, irrigated 23,763 mu of land, promptly planted large seedlings, and the seedlings grew very vigorously. The unirrigated land was still a patch of red soil, and small seedlings were not sown until July. The autumn harvest showed an even greater disparity. The large seedlings planted after winter irrigation yielded two sacks of sorghum and one dou of black beans (a total of 215 jin) per mu, while the late seedlings yielded only one sack, amounting to 100 jin. In the area near the Zhenxi Dike in Xiwu Township, the late seedlings yielded almost nothing. Having learned from these lessons, the leadership and the masses are giving high priority to winter irrigation from now on. At the village cadre conference arranged for the autumn grain requisition, a committee for irrigation was organized separately in the villages benefiting from the sluice gates. While collecting grain, they planned to dig irrigation ditches. The plan is to dig a ditch extending from the Fu River in the east to Dalaoying in the west, with a length of 5,480 zhang, approximately 14 li, capable of irrigating over 25,000 mu of land and benefiting 18 villages. One thousand young and middle-aged people are involved. They started digging the ditch actively on October 29th. The Hengtou Sluice, from the Fu River to the Zhenxi Dike, is 740 zhang long, and the young and middle-aged people of twelve villages are working on digging the ditch simultaneously. A total of thirteen sluices are in the district, with eight currently being dug and the rest planning to begin construction. According to statistics, the total length of the thirteen sluice ditches is more than 12,000 zhang (approximately 70 li). By November 10th, all the ditches had been opened. Because the Ma Village Sluice was dug early, it has already irrigated 1,000 mu of land. This winter, in order to irrigate more land, the principle is to follow the water flow. Wherever the water volume can irrigate more land, the ditch will be dug there, striving to irrigate all of the more than 100,000 mu in the district, laying the foundation for next year's major production.

　　今冬地浇好明春早按苗
  　平乡一区挖渠浇田
    【本报冀南廿四日电】平乡一区挖渠浇田。在去冬和今年正、二月间，郭桥、大东关等六七个村，浇地二三七六三亩，及时种上大苗，苗长的很旺。未浇的地，还是一片红土，直到七月才耩上小苗。秋季收成时，悬殊更大。冬季浇地种上的大苗，每亩收了两布袋高粱和一斗黑豆（共二百十五斤），而晚苗只收一布袋，合一百斤。西五乡靠近振西堤一带，晚苗简直没收。接受这些教训，领导上和群众把今后冬季浇地，给予高度重视。在秋征布置的村干大会上，另以闸沟受益村庄，组织浇地委员会，一面征收，一面计划挖浇地。计划挖沟，东至滏河，西至大老营，长五四八○丈，约十四里，能浇地二万五千亩以上，受益村十八个。青壮年一千名。已于十月二十九日积极动手挖沟。横头闸从滏河到振西堤，长七四○丈，十二个村的青壮年同时动工挖沟。全区共十三个闸，正挖沟者八个，其余正计划动工。统计十三个闸沟，全长一万二千余丈（约七十余里），到十一月十日，全部开沟。马庄闸因乾沟挖的早，现已浇地一千亩。今冬为了多浇地，以顺着输水为原则，水量那里能多浇地，就把沟挖到那里，争取将全区十万余亩全部浇完，给明年大生产打下基础。
