Helping the Masses in Newly Liberated Areas Overturn Their Situation
    Militia Work Teams Set Off
    [Our Taiyue dispatch of the 6th] Newly liberated area armed work teams, composed of militia members from Taiyue ×××, set off on a southern expedition on the ×th. The main purpose of this expedition is to help the farmers in the newly liberated areas to overturn their situation and to organize peasant armed forces. The work teams from each county have undergone training and rectification before departure, correcting their stance. Therefore, Comrade Wang Zengshou from Yicheng put forward "Five Thoroughs, Six No Fear" in his meritorious service plan, namely, thoroughly overturn the situation, thoroughly struggle, thoroughly pour out grievances, thoroughly avenge, and thoroughly distribute the fruits of victory. No fear of seesawing, no fear of sacrifice, no fear of rumors spread by secret agents, no fear of excessive opinions from the masses, no fear of hardship, no fear of activities by landlords and despots. Gaoping and Jincheng further put forward six major disciplines: firmly maintain our stance, listen to the opinions of the masses, do not beat or scold the masses, do not buy the fruits of struggle, do not harass women, return borrowed items, compensate for damaged items before leaving, and clean the house before leaving.

    帮助新区群众翻身
    民兵武工队出发
    【本报太岳六日电】由太岳×××民兵所组成的新区武装工作队，已于×日出发南征。此去主要帮助新区农民翻身及组织农民武装。各县武工队在出发前都经过整训，端正了立场。所以翼城王增寿同志的立功计划中提出“五彻底，六不怕”，即翻身翻彻底，斗争斗彻底，诉苦诉彻底，报仇报彻底，果实分彻底。不怕拉锯，不怕牺牲，不怕特务造谣，不怕群众多提意见，不怕吃苦，不怕地主恶霸活动。高平、晋城更提出六大纪律，立场站稳，倾听群众意见，不打骂群众，不买斗争果实，不调戏妇女，借东西要还，弄坏了东西不赔不走，房子不打扫不走。
