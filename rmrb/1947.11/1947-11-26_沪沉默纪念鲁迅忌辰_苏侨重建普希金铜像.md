　　Shanghai Silently Commemorates Lu Xun's Death Anniversary
　　Soviet Residents Rebuild Pushkin Statue
　　△On October 19th, Shanghai's cultural circles spent the eleventh anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's death in silence. Under Chiang Kai-shek's dark rule, they were unable to hold a memorial meeting like last year's, where ten thousand people wept together and raised battle flags. On this day, the Literary Association called on writers to commemorate Mr. Lu Xun through their work. Several literary magazines published special memorial issues, and bookstores offered spiritual food at reduced prices. Many young people and cultural figures still braved the danger to bring flowers to the International Cemetery in Hongqiao to express their condolences. Lu Xun's widow, Xu Guangping, took her beloved son, Haiying, to sweep the tomb. Lu Xun Publishing House spent a lot of effort repairing Mr. Lu Xun's tomb, which had been eroded by wind and rain, adding stone railings and clearing away weeds and thorns. Although "the tomb is overgrown with trees," Mr. Lu Xun's spirit continues to call for battle.
　　△Eleven years ago, during the centenary of the death of the great Russian poet Pushkin, Soviet residents in Shanghai erected a bronze statue of the poet at the intersection of Qiqi Road and Rue Joffre in Shanghai to mark the eternal commemoration. During the Japanese occupation of Shanghai, this bronze statue was taken away by the Japanese invaders. This year marks the 110th anniversary of Pushkin's death, and Soviet residents have raised funds to rebuild a new statue. The new statue was commissioned in Moscow and created by the famous Soviet sculptor Dogomozky. The newly made bust has recently arrived. The unveiling ceremony will be held as soon as the base is repaired. In addition, a translated edition of "The Complete Works of Pushkin," totaling more than 400,000 words, is being printed in Shanghai and will be published this month.

　　沪沉默纪念鲁迅忌辰
  　苏侨重建普希金铜像
    △十月十九日上海文化界在沉默中度过鲁迅先生逝世十一周年忌辰。在蒋介石黑暗统治下，他们已经无法举行象去年一样万人同声饮泣高举战旗的纪念大会了。这一天，文协号召作家们用工作来纪念鲁迅先生，好几种文艺杂志出了纪念专刊，书店也减价供应精神粮食。不少的青年和文化界人士，依然冒着危险携着鲜花到虹桥万国公墓表示哀思，鲁迅夫人许广平携着爱子海婴前往扫墓。鲁迅出版社化了许多工夫，把风雨蚀坏了的鲁迅先生墓园修理好了，加上了石栏杆，清除了蔓草荆棘。虽然是“墓木已拱，”但鲁迅先生的精神依然号召着战斗。
    △十一年前俄国大诗人普希金逝世百年祭时，上海苏联侨民曾在上海祁齐路贾尔业爱路口建有诗人之铜像，以志永恒纪念。沪沦陷期间此铜像为日寇搬走。今年适为普氏逝世一百十周年祭，苏联侨民又集资重造新像。此新像系在莫斯科定制，出自苏联名雕刻家多高莫兹基之手。现此新制的半身像已于日前运到。一俟基地修好后，即可举行揭墓典礼。又“普希金文集”译本，正在沪印刷中，全书四十余万字，本月间可出版。
