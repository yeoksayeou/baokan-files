　　Thorough Preparation, Joint Defense and Support
  　Laying Mines Everywhere to Cut Off Bandit Escape Routes
  　Jiaozuo's Anti-Grain Robbery Again Achieves Victory
    [Our Newspaper Taihang, 18th Dispatch] In Jiaozuo's anti-grain robbery struggle, landmines and cold shots killed or wounded 43 enemies. On the 2nd of this month, before dawn, over 500 enemies from Wangfeng and Lifeng, forcibly conscripting over 1,000 civilians, divided into four routes to rob grain from more than ten villages, including Hekou Village and Daxiaoliu Village. Because our villages had made early preparations before the enemy's attack, deploying landmines everywhere and communicating with each other, when the head of the joint defense of Lijing Village militia first engaged the enemy, the Lingchuan support team quickly arrived to assist in the battle. The militia's morale greatly increased, and they charged and killed the enemy. Villages such as Shierhui also came to participate in the battle, together driving the enemy down the mountain. At the same time, the Zhaozhidui also rushed to Daliu Village, coordinating with the militia to repel that enemy force. At this time, the East Joint Defense Wusantai guerrilla team took advantage of the situation to charge and kill the enemy. The Chiang bandits panicked and fled in disorder, and landmines exploded everywhere. At Hekou, six mines were detonated, killing eight people. At Liu Village, five mines were detonated, killing or wounding four enemies. At Da'ao, five mines exploded, wounding three enemies. At Li Bing, two mines exploded, killing or wounding two people. In the villages of Xuhe and Dongzhangzhuang, fifteen mines exploded, wounding 21 enemies. At Longdong, one mine exploded, killing one enemy. In addition, four enemies were killed by gunfire. The combination of cold shots and landmines by Lijing militia Wang Gulu was particularly ingenious: when the enemy ran in front of a mine, he suddenly fired a shot, causing the enemy to panic and step on the mine, killing or wounding one enemy each. After about two hours of battle, the enemy only managed to rob a few door panels, tables, chairs, and two shi of grain before fleeing in disarray. Post-battle review: The reasons for this victory, in addition to early preparation, joint defense operations, and mutual support, were that the militia correctly analyzed the enemy situation and that laying mines on the enemy's retreat route was very effective.

　　周密准备联防支援
  　处处埋雷断匪逃路
  　焦作反抢粮又获胜利
    【本报太行十八日电】焦作在反抢粮斗争中，以地雷冷枪炸死伤敌四十三名。本月二日天不明，王封、李封敌五百余，强拉民夫千余，分四路向我河口村，大小刘庄等十余村抢粮。因敌进攻前，我各村早作准备，遍布地雷，互通声气，故当中联防栗井村民兵首与敌接火时，陵川支援队即迅速赶来助战，民兵劲头大增，向敌冲杀，十二会等村亦赶来参加战斗，一齐将敌冲下山去。同时，赵支队亦赶到大刘庄，配合民兵将该路敌击退。此时，东联防毋三太游击队，又乘势向敌冲杀，蒋匪惊慌乱窜，地雷到处开花，敌在河口踏响六个，八人丧命，在刘庄又踏响五雷，死伤四敌，大凹响雷五个，伤敌三人，栗并响雷二个死伤二人，许河、东张庄两村响雷十五个，伤敌二十一人，龙洞响雷一个，炸死敌一人。此外又击毙敌四名。栗井民兵王谷禄冷枪结合地雷办法尤妙：乘敌跑到雷前时，突发一枪，敌张慌大乱，正踏上雷，炸死伤敌各一名。战约两小时，敌仅抢去几付门板、桌椅及两石粮食即狼狈逃窜。战后检讨：此次胜利原因，除了早准备、联防作战、互相支援外，民兵分析敌情正确，于敌败逃退路上埋雷，作用很大。
