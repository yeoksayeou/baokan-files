　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 21st—Harbin Electric Power Bureau's power generation has increased sevenfold compared to last year, and electricity supply to the entire city has been completed. The bureau held a labor model award ceremony on the 11th, and in reviewing the achievements of the year, it pointed out: On this day last year, Harbin's power supply was extremely difficult due to the Chiang bandits cutting off power from Fengman. The bureau's thermal power generators were mostly damaged due to years of disrepair, and daily power generation could not guarantee electricity for general citizens. Over the past year, they have overcome various difficulties, re-manufacturing by utilizing waste materials, and power outages have gradually decreased, from 36 outages in July to 16 in September; since October, there have been very few outages. Previously, the power plant's boilers could only generate an average of more than 2,000 kilowatts each, but now the average has increased by one and a half times. Fuel consumption has decreased day by day, saving 1,200 tons of coal alone in three months, and utilizing a large number of waste boilers and creating 15 types of mechanical parts and equipment from waste materials. The repair shop produced 5,980 large and small parts, repaired underground cables and power transmission towers blown down by the wind, and repaired and replaced utility poles, thereby increasing light intensity and avoiding fire hazards. Currently, with the exception of Xiangfang and Guxiang districts, where line construction is scheduled to be completed by the end of this month, the urban area has been fully electrified. The bureau's power supply extends to five counties including Suihua and Hulan.

　　哈市发电增加七倍
    【新华社东北廿一日电】哈尔滨市电业局发电量较去年增加七倍，全市送电即告完成。该局于十一日举行劳模授奖大会，回顾一年成绩中指出：去年今日因蒋匪断绝丰满供电，哈市电源异常困难。该局之火力发电机因年久失修，机器大部损坏，每日发电不能保证一般市民用电。一年来克服种种困难，利用废物重新修造，停电事故逐渐减少，由七月份之停电三十六次，减至九月份之十六次；十月迄今则很少停电。以前发电厂的锅炉平均每部只能发电二千多基罗瓦特，现在则平均增加一倍半。燃料消费量却逐日下降，三个月间仅煤一项即节约一千二百吨，并利用大量的废锅炉及利用废物创造各种机件器材十五种，修理厂制出大小机件五九八○件，重修地缆线及被风吹倒的送电铁塔，修换了电杆，因此加强了光度，避免了火险。目前哈市除香坊、顾乡两区架线工作将于本月底完成外，市区均已全部送电。该局供电范围并及于绥化，呼兰等五县。
