　　[Our newspaper's dispatch from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area on the 25th] Since the villages of Puyang began discussing joining the army on the 12th, mass mobilization, mutual inspiration, and fervent enthusiasm has resulted in fathers sending off their sons, wives sending off their husbands, brothers joining the front together, and teachers and students enlisting in the army together. Thirty-nine young men from Dingzhai Village swore an oath saying, "We won't go home until we defeat old Chiang!" Seventy-four people from Jiaoerzhai have already signed up. Ten teachers from the complete primary school, leading forty students of enlistment age, signed up for the army and then went to various villages to conduct propaganda mobilization and write slogans. Statistics show that within two days, 650 young farmers in the Second District have signed up for the army. In Qian Fan's family in the Sixth District, eighteen people have signed up; in Qicheng Village, fifty people have signed up. In the First District's Li Family Village, thirty young men signed up, and in Qinghetou in the Fourth District, sixty-six militiamen have already joined the army. District Chief Liu of the Fourth District sent his two sons to join the army, and Granny Xu Er of Wangling Village (who used to be a beggar) also sent her son to join the army. In Wang Wengun's family in the Eight Public Bridge of the Third District, all three brothers signed up together. Ma × Qiu Liang Wencheng and his two brothers also signed up for the army together, competing with Wang Wengun. Following this, the nine brothers of Li Shanben all signed up for the front line, winning the competition. In other districts and villages, the army enlistment movement is also developing vigorously. During the enlistment process, young women in the villages are busy making shoes and socks for their husbands who are joining the army. Each village has universally established recruitment cartoons, loudspeakers, and blackboards to promptly commend army recruitment models. The shadow play films in the Fourth District have also been changed into army recruitment pictures. The army recruitment movement in Puyang is in full swing.
