Xinhua News Agency, East China, 5th: Some time ago, U.S. naval aircraft and fleets invaded the Jiaodong Liberated Area, causing bloodshed. After the democratic government lodged a strong protest and held formal negotiations, the U.S. representatives issued a written apology, compensated for the losses, and guaranteed that "similar incidents will not occur again," thus concluding the matter. The details of the incident are as follows:

On August 27th, at approximately 5:00 PM, two U.S. fighter planes intruded into the airspace near Langnuankou and Xiaolidao villages, Rushan County (newly established county, south of Muping, east of Haiyang) in the Jiaodong Liberated Area. After circling for several weeks, one plane suddenly landed on the shore of Xiaolidao. Our side immediately discovered this and rescued the pilot, Lieutenant Winters, from danger. The next morning, nine U.S. aircraft again intruded into the vicinity of the village and circled at low altitude. In the afternoon, seven U.S. warships approached the coast. Without contacting the democratic government or obtaining permission, more than 60 U.S. troops, fully armed, landed without authorization, burned the plane, and directly invaded our Dongxilidao village, engaging in extensive harassment, damaging villagers' doors, windows, and utensils, and shooting and wounding villagers Ding Guilin, Zhou Zhirong, and Wang Lianying. Our coastal defense forces, in order to defend sovereignty and the people, repelled the landing U.S. troops. On September 1st, the U.S. side sent Navy Lieutenant Goling Teng to request negotiations. The democratic government severely rebuked the U.S. military's outrageous acts of unauthorized intrusion into our airspace, followed by repaying kindness with malice, armed landing, and killing and wounding our residents. It also presented a formal protest to the U.S. Navy, pointing out that the U.S. military's unreasonable intrusion into our airspace, territorial waters, and territory at a time when Chiang Kai-shek's bandits were frantically invading our coastal areas was clearly an act of cooperation with Chiang Kai-shek's bandits and constituted an intolerable hostile attitude. The democratic government made three demands to the U.S. side: (1) a written apology; (2) compensation for losses; and (3) a guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again in the future. After two rounds of negotiations, the U.S. representatives, including Rear Admiral Herrman, commander of the 71st Task Force of the U.S. Navy Western Pacific Fleet, had to admit their mistakes, deliver a letter of apology, compensate the villagers for their losses and medical expenses, and guarantee that similar incidents would not occur again in the future. The democratic government then escorted Winters to the shore of Xiaolidao and returned him to the U.S. side. The entire process from the occurrence of the incident to the conclusion of the negotiations lasted sixteen days. The two apology letters from the U.S. side are attached below:

    (1) Apology letter from U.S. Navy Lieutenant Goling Teng on behalf of Admiral Kirk, Commander-in-Chief of the Western Pacific Fleet: "On behalf of Admiral Kirk, I would like to express the following apology: We landed armed without your permission and injured your people. We fully acknowledge our mistake. This is entirely our fault. We are very regretful and hope that this incident will not happen again."

    (2) Apology letter from Rear Admiral Herrman, Commander of the 71st Task Force of the U.S. Navy Western Pacific Fleet: "We express our deepest apologies for landing armed without your government's permission and injuring three of your people. We absolutely guarantee and will pay close attention to ensure that the same incident does not occur again. We deeply regret disturbing the friendly relations between our two peoples."

    美军无理侵犯胶东
    民主政府提出严重抗议后
    美方代表已向我书面道歉
    【新华社华东五日电】月前美海军飞机及舰队一度侵犯胶东解放区，造成血案，经民主政府提出严重抗议与正式谈判后，已由美方代表书面道歉，赔偿损失，并保证“今后不再发生类此事件”而结束。该事件前后经过如下：
    八月二十七日下午五时许，胶东解放区乳山（新设县，在牟平南，海阳东）县浪暖口、小里岛村附近上空窜入美国战斗机二架，盘旋数周后，一架突然降落在小里岛海岸上。当经我方发觉，即将该机驾驶员尉官文特斯营救出险。翌日上午，美机九架又先后窜至该村附近低空盘旋，下午复有美舰七艘靠近海岸，未与民主政府联络，又未经允许，美军六十余人即全副武装擅自登陆，将该机焚毁后，并直侵至我东西里岛村，大肆骚扰，毁坏村民门窗用具等，并开枪击伤村民丁桂林、周志荣、王连英三人。我海防部队为保卫主权与人民，当将登陆美军击退。九月一日，美方派遣海军上尉高凌腾前来要求谈判，民主政府当就美机擅自侵入我领空，继之以怨报德，武装登陆，杀伤我居民之暴行，严加斥责，并提出向美海军的正式抗议书，指出美军正当蒋匪疯狂向我沿海侵扰之际，无理侵入我领空、领海、领土，显系配合蒋匪行动，实属不可容忍之敌对态度。并向美方提出三点要求：（一）书面道歉；（二）赔偿损失；（三）保证以后不再发生同样事件。经过两度谈判，美海军西太平洋联合舰队第七十一舰队少将司令赫尔门参加之美方代表不得不承认错误，致送道歉书，赔偿村民损失及医药费，并保证以后不再发生同样事件。民主政府当即将文特斯护送至小里岛海岸交回美方。自事件发生至谈判结束，共经十六天。美方道歉书二件附后：
    （一）美海军上尉高凌腾代表西太平洋联合舰队总司令柯克道歉书：“谨以柯克总司令的名义，致下列的歉意：我们未经你们的允许，竟武装登陆，并伤害你们的人民，我们完全承认我们的错误。这完全是我们的过失，我们很觉懊悔，希望此事件不再发生。”
    （二）美海军西太平洋联合舰队第七十一舰队少将司令赫尔门道歉书：“对于未经你们政府许可而武装登陆并伤害你们三个人民，我们表示最大的歉意。我们当绝对保证，并深切注意不使同样事件再行发生。我们对于骚扰两国人民间的友谊关系，寄予深痛的遗憾。”
