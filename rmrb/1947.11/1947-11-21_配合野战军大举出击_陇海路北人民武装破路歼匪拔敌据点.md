　　[Jilu Yu News, 19th] The masses and people's armed forces in the vast area from the south bank of the Yellow River to the north of the Longhai Railway actively cooperated with our field army's offensive, destroying and sweeping away Chiang bandit strongholds. When the Chen Su troops were sweeping away the Chiang bandits on the Longhai Line, the people of the Huxi Sub-district rushed to the Longhai Railway to participate in the destruction, with extremely high morale. The people's armed forces in our Henan area, in order to cooperate with the Huadong Field Army's operations, the local regiments and militias of the Third Sub-district launched an offensive against Zhao Zhuangji, a large stronghold entrenched 18 miles west of Fengxian County, on the first of last month. At dawn on the 8th, the Chiang bandits in Zhao Zhuangji were annihilated, killing and capturing more than 50 Chiang bandits, seizing 10 light and heavy machine guns, one howitzer, more than 200 rifles, and more than 8,000 rounds of ammunition. The enemy in strongholds such as Guzhai and Shixinzhuang in Fengbei had fled upon hearing the news. Our Seventh Sub-district local regiments and militias took advantage of the situation to sweep away the Chiang bandit strongholds in the Kunshan mountainous area, and in one fell swoop eliminated five strongholds including Woniu Mountain, Mao Wang, Lu Village, Hou River, and La Mountain. A part of the enemy's 72nd Division and all the Chiang bandit "Township Offices" were eliminated, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 100 enemies, seizing 11 light and heavy machine guns, more than 40 rifles, and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition. A certain unit of the local armed forces in our Seventh Sub-district also attacked Banjiu on the west bank of Dongping Lake, annihilating a company of the 8th Regiment of the Chiang bandit 3rd Brigade, capturing more than 40 enemies, and seizing one light machine gun and more than 40 rifles. In addition, our Second and Fifth Sub-district troops also took advantage of the powerful offensive of the Huadong Field Army to actively attack the Chiang bandits. The militia of the Fourth District of Yuncheng won three battles in three days, killing and wounding 29 Chiang bandits. The militia marched towards the Heze-Kaocheng Highway for days to cut off the Chiang bandits' retreat.
　　[Jilu Yu News, 19th] The militia of Kaocheng County killed, wounded, and captured 31 enemies in two and a half months. From July 25th to October 14th, the militia of this county, according to incomplete statistics, fought a total of 36 times, including four battles with enemy regular army forces of one company or more, eleven battles with local stubborn elements, and twenty-three night raids on local miscellaneous stubborn elements and puppet township governments and district headquarters, killing seven enemies, wounding seven enemies, and capturing seventeen enemies, totaling 31, seizing 14 long and short guns, 11 mules, horses, and donkeys, one cart, more than 30 catties of wire, three grenade launcher shells, six rifle grenades, two hand grenades, four flashlights, and more than one hundred pairs of shoes.
　　[Jilu Yu News, 19th] The American-style mountain artillery battalion of the Jilu Yu Military Region held live ammunition exercises in its stationed area. This American-style mountain artillery battalion is fully equipped with American equipment. Even our mountain artillery gunners are liberated Chiang army gunners; our veteran fighters are humbly learning their shooting experience, and the liberated gunners are also extremely enthusiastically teaching the techniques they learned under the Americans and Chiang Kai-shek to our army gunners. When our American-style mountain artillery fired at the target, every shot hit, and the visiting soldiers and local people praised frequently.

    【本报冀鲁豫十九日电】黄河南岸至陇海路北广大地区群众及人民武装，积极配合我野战军出击，破袭扫荡蒋匪据点。当陈粟大军扫荡陇海线之蒋匪时，我湖西分区人民，星夜奔赴陇海路，参加破击，人民情绪极为高涨。我河南地区人民武装，为配合华东野战军作战，三分区地方兵团及民兵于上月一日向盘踞丰县城西十八里之大据点赵庄集发动攻势，于八日拂晓，将赵庄集之蒋匪歼灭，毙俘蒋匪五十余名，缴轻重机枪十挺，平射炮一门，步枪二百余支，子弹八千余发。丰北之固寨、史新庄等数据点之敌，已闻风而逃。我七分区地方兵团与民兵，乘势向昆山山区蒋匪据点扫荡，一举拔除卧牛山、茂王、卢村、候河、腊山等五据点，敌七十二师一部及蒋匪“乡公所”全部被消灭，毙俘伤敌百余人，缴轻重机枪十一挺，步枪四十余支，子弹千余发。我七分区地方武装某部，也向东平湖西岸之斑鸠出击，歼灭蒋匪三旅八团一个连，俘敌四十余，缴轻机枪一挺，步枪四十余支。此外，我二、五分区部队，亦乘华东野战军强大攻势下，积极向蒋匪出击。郓城四区民兵三天打了三个胜仗，毙伤蒋匪二十九名，民兵则连日向菏（泽）考（城）公路进军，以截断蒋匪之去路。
    【本报冀鲁豫十九日电】考城县民兵，两个半月毙伤俘敌三十一名。该县民兵自七月二十五日，至十月十四日，两个半月不完全统计，共作战三十六次，计与敌正规军一个连以上的兵力作战四次，与土顽作战十一次，夜袭土杂顽及伪乡镇公所及区部二十三次，毙敌七名、伤敌七名、俘敌十七名共三十一名，缴获长短枪十四支、骡马驴十一头、马车一辆、电线三十余斤、掷弹筒弹三发、枪榴弹六个、手榴弹二枚、手电筒四个，鞋百余双。
