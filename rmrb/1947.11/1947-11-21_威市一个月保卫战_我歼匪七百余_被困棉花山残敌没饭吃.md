Xinhua News Agency, East China, 19th: The Weihaiwei Garrison Command recently released a one-month war report on the defense of Weihaiwei. From the 13th of last month to the 13th of this month, in one month, they fought 12 battles with the Chiang bandits who invaded Weihaiwei, killing and wounding over 700 enemies, including Zhao Pinyin, deputy head of the 322nd Regiment of the 108th Brigade of the reorganized 25th Division. Gao Zhenbang, a second lieutenant platoon leader of the 9th Company of that regiment, and eight others surrendered to us, and two enemy warships were damaged. The remaining enemies trapped in the Cotton Mountain area several miles outside the city are demoralized and have no supplies. They have been repelled several times when they went out to loot grain and fish.
