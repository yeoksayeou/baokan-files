Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd. According to reports from Tianjin's Dagong and Yishi newspapers quoting foreign news agencies, over 9,000 college and middle school students in Beiping defied Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary "General Mobilization Order" and heroically went on strike four times in protest against Chiang's fascist arrests last month. On November 1st, Yenching University protested the arrest of Gong Likang, a freshman female student in the Journalism Department, with over 800 teachers and students staging a strike. They also organized the "Yenching University Human Rights Protection Committee," posting slogans on campus demanding Chiang Kai-shek immediately and unconditionally release the arrested students. The university's student union stated that, if necessary, all students would accompany the arrested students to prison. On the 11th, over 2,400 Tsinghua students went on strike for three days in protest against Chiang Kai-shek's arrest of student Chen Yizhang. On the 12th, approximately 5,000 Peking University students went on strike for three days in protest against the arrest of over ten students including Meng Xianggong, Li Muyi, Li Yizhou, Xing Fujin, and Wu Mo. On the 13th, over 700 students from Peimanzhong Girls' School went on strike for three days in protest against the arrest of teachers Tian Cong and Chen Lian (daughter of Chiang Kai-shek's trusted secretary Chen Bulei). Faculty and students from various universities in Peiping did not retreat because Chiang Kai-shek's Garrison Headquarters falsely accused the arrested Peking University students of being "Communists." On the contrary, they took more active actions to protest Chiang Kai-shek's atrocities and rescue the arrested students. Over 900 Peking University students surrounded President Hu Shi on the evening of the 10th, demanding he come forward to negotiate for a rescue. On the 12th, the Peking University administrative meeting decided to establish a litigation committee. In addition to personnel designated by the school authorities, legal experts such as Professor Zhou Binglin also volunteered to participate, investigating the circumstances of the students' arrests and demanding that Chiang Kai-shek not use torture on the arrested students, provide a minimum amount of food, release those without sufficient evidence on bail, and transfer the rest to the court for public trial. During the Yenching University strike, several professors issued strong statements criticizing Chiang Kai-shek's illegal atrocities and expressing their determination to support the students and jointly resist. Mei Yibao, Dean of the College of Arts, personally went to the city to rescue the students. The strike at Peimanzhong Girls' School, a missionary school that had been relatively indifferent in previous student movements, marked an increase in the awareness of students in Peiping and the heightening of the anti-oppression movement.
	In addition to the above-mentioned students, one student from the Beiyang University's Peiping branch, Sun Cuiyu, a second-year student in the Department of Mining and Metallurgy at Tangshan Jiaotong University, and one senior student from Peiren Girls' School were also arrested last month.
	[Report from this newspaper] Jin-Cha-Ji Daily News: Chiang Kai-shek's arrest atrocities in Peiping aroused strong opposition from the people. All the students of Yenching University went on strike to protest. The Chiang Kai-shek authorities, fearing the aroused public indignation, released five arrested students, Wu Mo, Li Yizhou, Xing Fujin, Gong Likang, and Chen Zhangyuan, from Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Yenching University at 6 p.m. on the 1st and returned them to school.
	When Yenching University student Gong Likang returned to school, 500 Yenching University students stood outside the school gate to welcome her. After Gong got out of the car, she was lifted high by the students, who shouted slogans such as "Yenching University is one family!", "Long live freedom and democracy!" and "Unity is strength!"
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd. Over 2,000 students from Zhejiang University in Hangzhou held a demonstration to protest Chiang Kai-shek's arrest and massacre of the school's students. According to a United Press report from Hangzhou on the 1st, four people including Yu Zeshan (transliteration), chairman of the Zhejiang University Student Union, were arrested by Chiang Kai-shek some days ago. When Chiang Kai-shek's Zhejiang Provincial Government announced on the 30th that Yu Zeshan had "committed suicide" in prison, Zhejiang University students went on strike and held demonstrations. The Zhejiang University Student Union refuted Chiang Kai-shek's rumors, pointing out that the student had been tortured to death, not committed suicide. Zhejiang University students are now calling for a general strike of students in Hangzhou and other places to condemn Chiang Kai-shek's crime of murdering youth. Chiang Kai-shek's Zhejiang Provincial Government is extremely panicked about this and announced martial law on the evening of the 30th and blocked the spread of this news.

    北平学生四度罢课
    浙江大学学生举行示威
    【新华社陕北二日电】综合天津大公、益世两报外国通讯社消息，上月间北平大中学生九千余人，为抗议蒋匪法西斯逮捕，曾蔑视蒋匪反革命“总动员令”，先后四度英勇的举行罢课。上月一日，燕大抗议该校新闻系一年级女生龚理康被捕，全校师生八百余人举行罢课，并组织“燕大人权保障委员会”，在校内张贴标语，要求蒋匪立即无条件释放被捕学生。该校学生自治会表示：必要时全体学生当陪同被捕者入狱。十一日，清华学生二千四百余，抗议蒋匪逮捕该校学生陈以章，举行罢课三天。十二日，北大学生约五千人，抗议该校学生孟宪功、李慕贻、力易周、邢福津、吴谟等十余人被捕，举行罢课三天。十三日，贝满女中七百余人，抗议该校教师田骢、陈琏（蒋贼亲信秘书陈布雷之女）被捕，举行罢课三天。平市各大学师生并未因蒋匪警备司令部诬北大被捕学生为“共党”而退缩，相反的是以更积极行动抗议蒋匪暴行及营救被捕学生。北大学生九百余人，曾于十号晚包围校长胡适要求出面交涉营救；十二日北大行政会议决定成立诉讼委员会，除学校当局指定人员参加外，尚有老教授周炳琳等法学专家自动参加，调查学生被捕经过情形，并要求蒋匪对所捕学生不得用刑，供给最低限度食物，无充分证据者交保释放，其余则移交法庭公开审判。燕大罢课时，教授多人发表激烈声明，抨击蒋匪非法暴行，并表示决心支持学生，共同进行反抗。该校文学院院长梅贻宝并亲自进城营救。在过去历次学运中都表现比较冷淡的教会学校贝满女中的罢课，更标志着平市学生觉悟的提高与反压迫运动的高涨。
    上月中被捕学生，除上述者外，尚有北洋大学平部学生一人，唐山交大矿冶系二年级学生孙瘁宇及培仁女中高三学生一人。
    【本报讯】晋察冀日报消息：北平蒋匪逮捕暴行，激起人民强烈反对，燕大全体同学罢课以示抗议，蒋匪当局慑于群情激愤，乃于一日下午六时将北大、清华、燕京三校被捕学生吴谟、力易周、邢福津、龚理康及陈彰远五人释放返校。
    燕大学生龚理康返校时，燕大同学五百人，伫立校门外迎接，龚下车后即被同学高高举起，并欢呼“燕大一家！”“自由民主万岁！”及“团结就是力量！”等口号。
    【新华社陕北二日电】杭州浙江大学全校学生二千余人举行示威，抗议该校学生被蒋匪逮捕屠杀。据合众社杭州一日讯：浙大学生自治会主席俞泽山（译音）等四人日前遭蒋匪逮捕，当三十日蒋匪浙江省政府宣布俞泽山在狱中“自杀”时，浙大学生即罢课并举行示威，浙大学生自治会驳斥蒋匪造谣，指出该生系被拷打而死，而非自杀。浙大学生目前正号召杭市及各地学生举行总罢课，以声讨蒋匪此一屠杀青年罪行。蒋匪浙江省政府对此恐慌异常，已于三十日晚宣布戒严，并封锁此一消息传播。
