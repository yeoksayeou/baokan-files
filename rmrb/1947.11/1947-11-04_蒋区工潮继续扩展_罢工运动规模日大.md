Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th. According to various sources: Labor unrest in the Chiang-controlled areas is developing in waves. The huge strike movement in Shanghai, which lasted for more than ten days from the end of last month to the beginning of this month, was brutally suppressed by the Chiang Kai-shek fascist bandits, but the starving workers are still taking various forms to persist in the struggle. On the 22nd of this month, more than 400 workers in a silk factory went on strike to protest the capitalists' sabotage of the principle of wage distribution. The labor unrest at the Qilu Enterprise Company's rubber factory, a bureaucratic capitalist enterprise of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Qingdao, which was caused by the factory's unreasonable increase in working hours, has persisted for more than a month despite various suppressions by the Chiang bandit authorities. The factory later announced a shutdown in an attempt to dismiss workers. The Qingdao General Labor Union held a reception for the press on the 21st of last month, denouncing the crimes of bureaucratic capitalists colluding with the government to oppress workers, and announced that it would launch a city-wide fundraising campaign involving 70,000 workers to support the factory workers. Labor disputes have also occurred at the Dehe Iron Factory and the New Tianjin Rubber Factory in Tianjin. Although a meeting was held on the 24th of last month, it was fruitless due to the capitalists' unreasonable refusal to meet the workers' demands for improved treatment and the Chiang bandit Social Bureau's "Labor-Capital Arbitration Committee" favoring the capitalists. The situation is still developing. At the same time, the Tianjin carpet industry union workers' demand for wage increases has achieved initial success.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th. Moscow Radio broadcast on the 19th a commentary by Koligoyev on the development of the labor movement in the Chiang-controlled areas, saying: "In Shanghai, Hankou, and other cities in China under Kuomintang control, the strike movement is expanding." After recounting the extreme misery of workers' lives brought about by the Chiang bandits' traitorous and dictatorial rule, Koligoyev continued: "According to statistics from American magazines, in the first half of 1946, nearly 100,000 workers in the Chiang-controlled areas participated in strikes, and 450,000 people were involved in labor disputes every month. At the end of 1946, no matter how much the Kuomintang strengthened its terror tactics, the number of strikers and workers involved in labor disputes greatly increased." Koligoyev pointed out that since the Chiang bandit authorities issued an order this year prohibiting wage increases, labor unrest has continued to surge in various parts of the Chiang-controlled areas. "The wave of strikes in June almost swept the country; in July, strike movements also occurred in Shanghai, Chongqing, and Tianjin; in August and September, workers and staff in Hong Kong, Hankou, and Guangzhou joined the strike movement. The scale of the strike movement in September even exceeded the previous months." Koligoyev pointed out that the Kuomintang is currently cruelly destroying mass (worker-established) trade unions, but the workers' struggle for survival continues to develop.

    蒋区工潮继续扩展
    罢工运动规模日大
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】据各方消息：蒋区工潮正彼落此起地向前发展。沪市自上月底至本月初持续旬余之巨大罢工运动，虽遭蒋家法西斯匪徒血腥镇压，饥饿职工仍采取各种形式坚持斗争。本月二十二日又有丝绸工厂四百余，工人为抗议资方破坏发给工资原则，而举行怠工。青岛蒋家匪帮官僚资本之齐鲁企业公司所属橡胶厂千余工人，因厂方无理增加工作时间，而引起之工潮，虽遭蒋匪当局之多方镇压，仍坚持月余之久。该厂后竟宣布停工，妄图开除工人，青岛总工会于上月二十一日招待新闻界，痛斥官僚资本勾结官府压迫工人之罪恶，并宣布将发动全市七万工人募捐，以声援该厂工人。天津德和铁厂及新天津橡胶厂亦均发生劳资纠纷，虽经上月二十四日一度会商，但因资方无理拒绝工人改善待遇要求，及蒋匪社会局“劳资评断会”偏袒资方，致毫无结果，事态尚在发展中。与此同时，津市地毯业产业工会工人之增资要求，则获得初步胜利。
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】莫斯科电台十九日广播柯里果耶夫评论蒋区职工运动之发展称：“在上海、汉口和国民党管辖的中国其他城市中，罢工运动正在扩展。”柯氏历述由于蒋匪卖国独裁统治带给工人生活之极度惨状后，继称：“据美国杂志统计：一九四六年上半年，蒋管区曾有将近十万工人参加罢工，而卷入劳资纠纷的每月则有四十五万人之多。在一九四六年年底，不管国民党如何加强恐怖手段，罢工的人数和卷入劳资纠纷的工人，都大大增加了。”柯氏论及自今年蒋匪当局下令禁止提高工资后，蒋区各地工潮继续汹涌澎湃。“六月间罢工的浪潮差不多已波及全国；七月间上海、重庆、天津也发生了罢工运动，八、九两个月香港、汉口、广州的工人和职员都加入了罢工运动。九月间的罢工运动的规模更超过以前几个月。”柯氏指出：目前国民党正在残酷摧残带有群众性的（工人自己成立的）职工会，但工人为求生存的斗争却在继续发展中。
