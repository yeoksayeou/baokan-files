    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: Reports from various sources indicate that Premier Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has vehemently denounced the "Independence Proposal" put forward by French special envoy to Vietnam, Bollaert, which attempts to coerce the Republic of Vietnam into submission with five conditions that would destroy the country and exterminate its people. He solemnly declared: "French imperialism, while pretending to grant Vietnam 'independence,' is actually depriving the Vietnamese people of their military, diplomatic, financial, and other powers. This act of feeding a dog with boneless meat fully exposes the ridiculous and autocratic face of French imperialism. Now, the reactionary French faction, weakened and reduced to a vassal of American imperialism, still attempts to enslave the Vietnamese people with its most despicable methods. We will never accept this proposal." Ho Chi Minh also pointed out: The Vietnamese puppet "National Assembly representatives" recently surrounded Annamese King Bao Dai in Hong Kong, instigating Bao Dai to return to Vietnam and serve as a puppet in order to negotiate peace with France. Ho warned Bao Dai: "If you willingly serve as a running dog of French imperialism, you will not only destroy your history but also cut off your future." The Vietnamese People's Anti-French Army under the leadership of Ho Chi Minh is currently resolutely striking at the French invading forces in the vast areas of the Red River and Black River in the Tonkin region, as well as in Lang Son, Bac Kan, Thai Nguyen, and other places.

    【新华社陕北二日电】各方讯，越南民主共和国总理胡志明痛斥法国亡越特使波拉特提出的企图以五项亡国灭种条件威迫越南共和国就范的“独立建议书”，并严正声明称：“法国帝国主义伪装给予越南‘独立’，实则剥夺越南人民的军事、外交、财政等等权力，此种以无肉之骨飨狗之举，充分暴露了法帝国主义愚蠢可笑的专制面目。今已衰弱并沦为美帝国主义附庸的法国反动派，犹图行使其最下贱的方式奴役越人， 我们决不接受该项建议” 。胡志明同时指出：越南伪“国民议会代表”顷在香港包围安南逊王保大，唆使保大返越充当傀儡，好与法国谈判和平。胡氏警告保大：“如果甘充法帝国主义之走狗，不但自毁其历史，且将自绝其前途。”胡志明领导下的越南人民抗法军队，现正在东京区之红河黑河及谅山、巴高、太欲元等之广大区域，坚决打击法国侵略军。
