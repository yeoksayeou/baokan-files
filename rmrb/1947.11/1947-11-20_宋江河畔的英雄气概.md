　　Heroic Spirit on the Banks of the Song Jiang River
    Ding Chuan　Zhou You
    On the 21st of last month, the East China People's Liberation Army, with the assistance of the people of Yuncheng, recovered Yuncheng. The reporters interviewed the people on the banks of the Song Jiang River. This river flows directly into Liangshanbo from the south of Liangshanbo. The people on both sides of the river inherited the glorious tradition of the heroes of Liangshanbo and are developing a new heroic spirit:
    I. Old woman burns incense and curses Old Chiang
    Half a month ago, this place was still a land of humiliation and damage. The people could not live under the destructive devastation of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops. Old women in villages around Dongzhanglou under Liangshan Mountain went to temples in droves to burn incense and offer sacrifices, cursing Old Chiang, and composed ballads saying:
    "The sky is red,
    The earth is red (referring to the Communists being red),
    Bless the Eighth Route Army for ten thousand years of prosperity,
    May those grandsons of turtles (referring to the Chiang bandits) die quickly!"
    Also, one night, the masses in the Sixth District lit lanterns and torches everywhere, burning Chiang Kai-shek, expressing their hatred.
    II. As long as I don't die, I will always say the Eighth Route Army is good.
    A certain enemy junior officer stationed in Datun Village asked the farmer Li ××:
    "Do you think the Central Government is good, or the Eighth Route Army is good?"
    He answered simply and decisively: "When the Eighth Route Army comes to a village, first, they don't cut down trees, second, they don't beat or scold people, and third, they don't climb over walls to abuse women. Unlike you..."
    As Li ×× spoke, he cursed, and the Chiang Kai-shek officer took him to the company headquarters and reported to the company commander: "This person always says the Eighth Route Army is good. If you don't believe me, please ask him, company commander." Sure enough, the company commander asked Li: "Who do you think is good?" Li answered as decisively as before: "In the end, the Eighth Route Army is good." Without saying a word, the company commander sent someone to take him to the battalion headquarters.
    When the battalion commander asked him, he was already impatient and said indignantly:
    "Say it again, the Eighth Route Army is still good. As long as I don't die, I will say the Eighth Route Army is good, you are not good!"
    Death can't scare me!
    Shan Hai Ren ××, when the enemy wanted to demolish his house to clear obstacles, he wanted to take out the pots and bowls from the house, but the enemy didn't allow it, so he said angrily: "If you can't beat the Eighth Route Army, even if you demolish all the houses in our village, it won't work!"
    An enemy soldier pointed at him and shouted: "You are really an old Eighth Route soldier, if you say any more, you will be shot!"
    But Ren ×× sneered fearlessly:
    "I have lived enough for sixty years, can I live another sixty years? Death can't scare me..."
    III. Collective action against rape
    Women in Shan Hai gathered together every night. During the day, everyone scattered in the streets. If a sister was pulled or raped, everyone shouted in unison, scaring away many shameless bandits. They used this method to protect themselves. Now, the land and people on the banks of the Song Jiang River have been liberated again. In order to ensure the supply of the troops, the women are happily working day and night, pushing the mills and making anti-offensive shoes. All the livestock and manpower in the villages have been organized to rush to plant wheat. In the embrace of the People's Government of the Liberated Area, the people on the banks of the Song Jiang River will have a new heroic spirit even more glorious than in history.

　　宋江河畔的英雄气概
    丁川　周有
    上月二十一日，华东人民解放大军，在郓城人民协助之下，收复了郓城，记者走访了宋江河畔的人民，该河在梁山泊南，直流梁山泊，沿河两岸的人民，承继了梁山泊好汉的光荣传统，在发展着一种新的英雄气概：
    一、老太太焚香咒老蒋
    半月之前，那里还是一片被污辱与损害的土地，老百姓在蒋匪军毁灭性的摧残之下，无法生活了。梁山下东张楼一带村庄，老太太成群结队的到庙里烧香上供，咒老蒋，并编出歌谣道：
    “天也红，
    地也红（指共产党是红色的意思），
    保佑八路军万年兴，
    叫那些龟孙（指蒋贼）快点死吧！”
    又某天夜晚，六区群众到处点起灯笼火把，火烧蒋介石。表示了他们的憎恨。
    二、只要我不死，总要说八路军好。
    驻大屯村的某敌下级军官，问农民李××：
    你说中央好呢？还是八路好呢？”
    他简单而干脆的答道：“八路军到那村一来不锯树，二来不打人不骂人，三来不爬墙头，糟践妇女。不象你们，……”
    李××边讲边骂，那个蒋家军官把他带往连部，报告连长说：“这个人老说八路军好，若不信请连长问问他。”果然，连长问李：“你说到底谁好？”李和上次一样干脆的答道：“到底还是八路军好。”连长二话没说，便派人把他带交营部。
    当营长问他时，他已经不耐烦了，很愤慨的说：
    “再说一遍还是八路军好，只要我不死，我就说八路军好，你们不好！”
    死，吓不住我！
    单海任××，当敌人要拆除他的房子以扫除障碍时，要把屋里的锅碗瓢勺拿出来，但敌人不许，他就怒冲冲的说：“你要是打不过八路军，就是把俺村房子都拆完，也还是不中！”
    敌兵指着他喝道：“你真是老八路，再多嘴枪毙你！”
    但任××毫不畏惧的冷笑道：
    “我已活够六十岁啦，我还能再活六十岁吗？死，吓不住我……”
    三、集体行动反强奸
    单海妇女每到夜晚就集合一起，白天大家都散在街上，若有某姊妹被拉或被强奸时，大伙就齐声呐喊，吓退过许多无耻匪徒。她们用这个方法保护了自己。现在，宋江河畔的土地和人民，重获解放了。为了保证部队供给，妇女们日夜欢快的忙碌着推碾、做反攻鞋，各村所有的牲口与人力，已经组织起来突击种麦了。在解放区人民政府的怀抱里，宋江河畔的人民，将有着比历史上更光辉的新英雄气概。
