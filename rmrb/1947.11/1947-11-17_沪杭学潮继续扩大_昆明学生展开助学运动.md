　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th. The righteous struggle of students in the Chiang-controlled areas is continuing to expand. According to a TASS dispatch from Shanghai on the 12th, in Hangzhou, in addition to Zhejiang University's renewed week-long strike, Zhijiang University also announced a week-long strike, denouncing Chiang Kai-shek's atrocities of arresting and slaughtering students in various places. In Shanghai, in addition to Jiaotong University and St. John's University already holding strikes, all 4,000+ students of Shanghai University also held a one-day strike. When more than 10,000 students in Kunming held a demonstration parade a few days ago, they bravely surrounded the residence of Lu Han, chairman of the Chiang Kai-shek Yunnan Provincial Government; putting forward demands such as the immediate release of arrested teachers and students. Chiang Kai-shek's suppression of the students' righteous actions has become even more intensified. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 12th, when Fudan University planned to hold a strike in support of Zhejiang University students' demands, Chiang Kai-shek immediately ordered the school to expel nine students. In addition, four students from the school were arrested by Chiang Kai-shek during the anti-hunger and anti-civil war movements in May and June and are still being detained.
    Xinhua News Agency, Central Hebei, 12th. Tianjin newspaper Kunming dispatch: Kunming students have broken through Chiang Kai-shek's obstruction and enthusiastically launched a student aid movement. On October 26th, students from more than 30 universities and middle schools, including Yunnan University and Kunming Normal University, organized a student aid committee to raise funds to help classmates suffering from hunger and cold. The schools issued challenges to each other to compete, and students donated their pens, watches, valuable books, clothes, etc. for charity sales. Female students organized sewing, laundry, knitting, and sales teams, with some working 15 hours a day. By the end of October, they had raised 240 million yuan in Chiang Kai-shek currency in a few days. When this movement began, the Chiang Kai-shek Yunnan authorities obstructed it in many ways. When the students planned to launch street fundraising, Lu Han, chairman of the Chiang Kai-shek Yunnan Province, used the excuse of "damaging integrity" to stop it. However, the students disregarded any obstruction and still gathered 10,000 people on the scheduled date (November 2nd), marching in formation to conduct charity sales and solicit donations in the city. They also carried out publicity, speeches, and street plays on the streets, winning the enthusiastic sympathy of the citizens, who generously donated.

　　沪杭学潮继续扩大
  　昆明学生展开助学运动
    【新华社陕北十四日电】蒋管区学生正义斗争，现继续扩大中。据塔斯社沪十二日讯：杭州除浙大学生再度罢课一周外，之江大学亦宣布罢课一周，声讨蒋匪在各地逮捕屠杀学生罪行。上海方面，除交大、圣约翰已举行罢课外，沪江大学全校学生四千余人亦举行罢课一日。昆明学生万余人日前举行示威游行时，曾英勇的包围蒋匪云南省政府主席卢汉住宅；提出立即释放被捕师生等要求。蒋匪对学生正义行动的镇压已变本加厉，据美联社沪十二日讯：当复旦大学拟声援浙大学生要求举行罢课时，蒋匪即勒令该校开除学生九人。又该校学生四人于五六月间反饥饿、反内战时遭蒋匪逮捕，至今仍在扣押中。
    【新华社冀中十二日电】津报昆明讯：昆明学生曾冲破蒋匪阻挠，热烈展开助学运动。云大、昆师等三十余大中学学生，十月二十六日组织助学委员会，募集助学金救济饥寒交迫的同学，各校发出挑战书互相竞赛，学生纷纷捐出自己的水笔、手表、珍贵书籍、衣服等义卖，女生更组织缝纫、洗衣、编织、售物队等，有一日工作十五小时者。至十月底数日内即募集蒋币二亿四千万元。此一运动开始时，蒋匪云南当局即多方阻挠，及至学生拟展开街头募捐时，蒋匪云南省主席卢汉竟以“有损气节”为借口加以制止，但学生蔑视任何阻挠，于预定日期（本月二日）仍集合万人，列队出发市面进行义卖、劝募，并在街头分别展开宣传、演讲、演出街头剧等，博得市民热烈同情，纷纷解襄捐助。
