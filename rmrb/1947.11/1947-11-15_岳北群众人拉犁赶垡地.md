　　【This Dispatch from Taiyue, 13th】To solve the difficulty of autumn soil turning, the masses in Northern Yue have been actively organizing people to pull ploughs and catch up with the soil turning progress. In Daixian Village, the Second District of Qin County, there were only 28 animals for 1,614 mu of autumn land, and only over 840 mu had been ploughed by the 2nd of this month. At a mass meeting in the village, it was decided that people should pull ploughs to replace animal power. Thus, on the 4th, under the leadership of village cadres, 11 human-pulled ploughs were organized, which could plough 46 mu of land each day. The women who did not participate in pulling ploughs organized themselves to clear stubble, striving to finish the autumn soil turning of the entire village within ten days. In Yan Su Village, the Third District of Tunliu, there are 1,493 mu of autumn land, but only 28 animals. On average, each animal has to plough 53 mu. It would be impossible to finish before the ground freezes. The village cadres called on people to voluntarily combine and organize four human-pulled ploughs, cooperating with 16 pairs of animals, which could plough 70 mu per day. The remaining men and women with full and semi-labor power were organized to clear 28 mu each day. In this way, everyone confidently said, "It will not be a problem to finish before the ground freezes." Starting from the 7th of this month, all the men and women in the village went to the fields, pulling, clearing, and ploughing, launching a rush to turn the soil, striving to finish within ten days.

　　岳北群众人拉犁赶垡地
    【本报太岳十三日电】岳北群众解决秋垡困难，纷纷组织人拉犁垡地。沁县二区待贤村一千六百一十四亩秋地，只有二十八个牲口，至本月二日仅犁了八百四十余亩。全村群众大会上，研究必须组织人拉犁代替畜力，于是在全村干部的带头下，于四日组织了十一张人拉犁，每一天能犁四十六亩地，其余未参加人拉犁的妇女，便组织起来刨茬，争取在十天内将全村的秋地垡完。屯留三区燕粟村，亦有秋地一千四百九十三亩，仅有牲口二十八头，平均每头牲口要犁五十三亩，至上冻时无论如何垡不完，村干部便号召自由结合，组织了四张人拉犁，配合十六犋牲口，每天能犁七十亩，剩下的男女全半劳力组织起来，每天也能刨二十八亩，这样大家都很有信心的说：“赶上冻前，不成问题垡完了。”从本月七日起，全村男女齐上地，拉的拉，刨的刨，犁的犁，展开了抢垡运动，争取十天内垡完。
