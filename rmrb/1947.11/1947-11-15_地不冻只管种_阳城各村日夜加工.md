　　“Where the ground doesn't freeze, just keep planting.” Yangcheng villages continue to increase the planting of counter-offensive wheat. In Baijian Village, after the mobilization by instructor Liang Jiangong on October 13th, everyone enthusiastically made guarantees, especially the women. For example, women's group leader Zhao Baijun did not sleep at night and led four women to carry manure and plant wheat for a military family, Liu Xiaohui, on one mu of land. Liu Fengying led women to plow, hoe, and plant wheat themselves on three mu of land. The village planned to plant 300 mu of wheat in three days, but completed 326.8 mu in just two and a half days. In Gulong Village, each team also launched a wheat planting competition. Under the leadership of Ma Shanglin and Bai Yinshui, everyone worked energetically. People shouted, and oxen bellowed in the streets and fields. The elderly plowed the land, and young people carried manure. In order to finish planting as soon as possible, Wei Linyuan's group plowed and planted day and night, completing 318 mu in three days, exceeding the original plan by 38 mu. Shangli Village also completed the task of increasing planting by 180 mu in three days in two and a half days during the competition, exceeding the target by 20 mu. In the wheat planting process, they also combined it with 230 mu of autumn plowing. Wang Jinwang, a liberated poor peasant in Zhuangtou Village, was even more active. He said, "Planting wheat can provide food for two seasons." He planted seven and a half mu of wheat on the nine and a half mu of land he obtained after liberation. Starting from October 21st, he hoed stubble and made fertilizer at night, and worked with the mutual aid group during the day, and finished planting the wheat fields by the 27th.

    【本报太岳十三日电】“地不冻只管种”，阳城各村继续增种反攻麦。白涧村于十月十三日在指导员梁建功动员下，大家纷纷提出保证，特别是妇女更为踊跃，如妇女组长赵白俊，黑夜没有睡即带领四个妇女给军属刘小会担粪点麦一亩，刘凤英带领妇女自犁自刨自点种麦三亩，全村计划三天种麦三百亩，仅两天半就种了三百二十六亩八分。固隆村各分队并展开了种麦竞赛，在马尚麟、白引水带头下大家不明就起来，街上地里人喊牛叫，老年人犁地，青年人担粪，魏林元组为了争取早日种完，日夜犁种，三天中也种完三百一十八亩，超过原计划三十八亩。尚礼村也在竞赛中，两天半完成三天增种一百八十亩的任务，还超过多二十亩，在种麦中，又结合秋垡地二百三十亩。庄头村翻身贫民王金旺更是积极，他说：“种麦可以吃两季”。把翻身得来的九亩半地就种了七亩半麦，从十月二十一日开始，他黑夜刨茬造肥，白天和互助组一齐干，到二十七日就把麦地种完了。
