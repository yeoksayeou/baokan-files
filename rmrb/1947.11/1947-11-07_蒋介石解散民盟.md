    Chiang Kai-shek Dissolves the Democratic League
    On October 27th, Chiang Kai-shek declared the Democratic League an "illegal organization" and implemented further persecution of its members. Chiang Kai-shek's government, of course, fabricated many absurd "charges" against the Democratic League, but all these slanders only made people feel more strongly the ugliness of Chiang Kai-shek's rule. For example, Tao Xisheng, the Deputy Minister of Propaganda of Chiang Kai-shek, who was notorious for following Wang Jingwei in surrendering to the enemy, actually had the audacity to publish a lengthy, foul-smelling essay to prove that the leaders of the Democratic League were "Zheng Xiaoxu and Zhao Xinbo." This is a living specimen of the "propriety, justice, integrity, and shame" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. This only makes the people more clearly aware that the Democratic League, in several historical junctures, carried out political cooperation with the CCP on some democratic programs, thereby promoting China's democratic cause, which is the glory of the Democratic League. As is well known, the Democratic League is a broad and loose alliance, which on the one hand accommodates many democratic fighters who resolutely oppose Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship and American imperialist aggression, and some, such as Wen Yiduo, Li Gongpu, and Du Bin cheng, gave their lives for this. On the other hand, it also accommodates many people who, while opposing or being dissatisfied with Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship, not only in the past but also now, still harbor certain illusions about Chiang Kai-shek, especially about American imperialism. In any case, the Democratic League is only an organization empty-handed, they "don't even have a pistol," and don't intend to have one; their reliance is on freedom of speech and publication, but such weapons have long been confiscated by Chiang Kai-shek. Allowing an organization like the Democratic League to exist, under normal circumstances, even if a government is already aware of its own crisis, should not be anything to be afraid of. But Chiang Kai-shek, who is terminally ill, is afraid of such an organization today. He would rather show the fascist teeth to this organization and allow the last illusion of carrying out any peaceful movement, legal movement, or reform movement under Chiang Kai-shek's rule to vanish. Chiang Kai-shek often carefully hides his illness, but the dissolution of the Democratic League suddenly revealed to all of China and the world how weak he already is. Although American imperialists signed a 30 million U.S. dollar "relief" agreement with Chiang Kai-shek, there is no way to give him a tranquilizer. In fact, the doctors at the White House themselves have no medicine to calm themselves down. They are also afraid of the Democratic League operating as usual, so they decided to approve this obviously stupid step in Nanjing. Countless past experiences have shown that Chiang Kai-shek has never dared to make such a major decision as dissolving the Democratic League without the approval and participation of American imperialists.
    The actual significance of Chiang Kai-shek's dissolution of the Democratic League and the large-scale persecution of democratic elements in major cities is only to expose and aggravate the extremely urgent crisis of the Nanjing rule, and it cannot alleviate this crisis in the slightest. Everyone knows that the basic characteristic of China's democratic movement is that the armed revolutionary people oppose the armed counter-revolutionary group. Therefore, the high tide of the Chinese democratic revolution is basically manifested as the high tide of armed struggle. It should be pointed out that since the People's Liberation Army on all fronts turned to a large-scale counter-offensive in July, August, and September this year, a new high tide of the Chinese revolution has arrived. The role that the people's struggles in major cities oppressed by Chiang Kai-shek's reign of terror can play in this revolutionary high tide is only of a supporting nature, and it can only effectively occur at the time of final maturity. Therefore, all Chiang Kai-shek's terrorist actions in these cities have not and cannot in any sense prevent the victorious advance of the People's Liberation Army. On the contrary, this can only educate the people that, to have freedom and genuine peace, they must resolutely use force to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek, resolutely support the armed revolutionary struggle of the People's Liberation Army, and must not rely on any peaceful, legal, or reformist methods. Another serious lesson that Chiang Kai-shek's terrorist actions have given the people is that the Chinese landlord and capitalist class, represented by Chiang Kai-shek, is resolutely opposed to the people to the end, until their last day. This is a vicious jackal, and it will never repent. It is worth noting that at the same time as Chiang Kai-shek dissolved the Democratic League and carried out large-scale persecution of democratic elements, some politicians of the Kuomintang are spreading an atmosphere of "peace" centered on South China. It is said that this "peace" atmosphere is related to Song Ziwen, who was recently ordered to take office as Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, and Sun Ke, the Vice Chairman of the Nanjing government, who was recently ordered to issue a statement against the Soviet Union and threatening the United States. But these swindling conspirators take the people too foolishly. Everyone with common sense cannot help but be wary of why these "peace" envoys do not even dare to use the Democratic League as their ally, but would rather bring out rotten banners like Song Ziwen and Sun Ke? Is this not because they have ulterior motives and are afraid of people's advocacy and opposition? Does this not prove that the Chinese landlord and capitalist class, together with their masters, the American aggressors, are always determined to oppose the Chinese people, no matter when or what clothes they wear? Therefore, if the Chinese people want freedom and genuine peace, they must resolutely smash their political conspiracies, just as they smash their military offensives, and carry out their revolutionary cause to the end. The Democratic League should now learn a lesson: any illusions about the American aggressors and the Chiang Kai-shek ruling clique or some of its factions are useless to themselves and the people. They should eliminate these illusions and resolutely stand on the side of the truly people's democratic revolution. There is no middle road. If the Democratic League can do this, then the Democratic League being declared illegal by Chiang Kai-shek cannot harm the Democratic League, but instead gives the Democratic League the possibility of moving towards a brighter path than in the past.

### 蒋介石解散民盟

专栏：新华社时评

    蒋介石解散民盟
    蒋介石在十月二十七日宣布民主同盟为“非法团体”，并对该盟人员实行进一步的迫害。蒋介石政府当然给民主同盟捏造了许多荒唐的“罪状”，但是一切这些诬陷只是使人们更加强烈地感觉到蒋介石统治的丑恶。比方说，因追随汪精卫投敌而臭名昭著的蒋介石宣传部副部长陶逆希圣居然有脸皮发表长篇的臭论，来证明民盟的领导者是“郑孝胥、赵欣伯。”这就是蒋介石集团“礼义廉耻”的活标本。这只是使人民更加确切地认识民主同盟在若干历史关节中，实行了与中共在部分民主纲领上的政治合作，从而推进了中国民主事业，乃是民主同盟的光荣。如所周知，民主同盟是一个广泛而松弛的联合，其中一方面容纳许多坚决反对蒋介石独裁和美帝国主义侵略的民主战士，并有一些例如闻一多、李公朴、杜斌丞等，为此献出了他们的生命。另一方面，也容纳许多虽然一面反对或不满蒋介石独裁，但在另一方面却不但过去而且现在仍然对蒋介石，特别是对美帝国主义怀抱某种幻想的人物。无论如何，民主同盟只是一个赤手空拳的组织，他们“连一支手枪也没有”，并且不打算有，他们的凭籍就是言论出版，而这样的武器也早已被蒋介石没收了。允许民盟这样一个组织存在，在通常的情形下，即令一个政府已经自己觉到自己的危机，也应该是没有什么可怕的。但是病入膏肓的蒋介石，今天害怕这样一个组织，他宁可向这个组织露出法西斯野兽的牙齿，宁可使在蒋介石统治下进行任何和平运动、合法运动、改良运动的最后幻想归于破灭。蒋介石常常小心隐藏自己的病状，但是解散民盟这件事，却一下子就向全中国全世界泄露了他已经是何等衰弱不堪。美帝国主义者尽管跟蒋介石签订三千万美元的“救济”协定，但是没有办法给他一付镇定剂，实在说白宫的医生自己也没有药品可以镇定自己，他们也害怕民盟照往常一样的活动，因此就决定批准南京的这个显然愚蠢的步骤。过去的无数经验表明，象解散民盟这样的大事，没有美帝国主义者的批准和参预，蒋介石是从来不敢擅自决定的。
    蒋介石解散民盟和在各大城市中大施迫害民主分子，其实际意义只是暴露和加重南京统治的异常紧迫的危机，而决不能丝毫减轻这个危机。大家知道中国民主运动的基本特点，乃是武装的革命人民反对武装的反革命集团。因此中国民主革命的高潮，基本上也就表现为武装斗争的高潮。应该指出：自从今年七、八、九月各路人民解放军先后转入大举反攻以后，中国革命的新高潮已经到来了。被蒋介石恐怖统治所压迫的各大城市的人民斗争，在这个革命高潮中间，所能起的作用只能是配合性质的，而且只能有效地发生于最后成熟的时机。因此蒋介石在这些城市中的一切恐怖行动决没有也决不能在任何意义上阻止人民解放军的胜利前进；相反地，这只能教育人民，要有自由，要有真正的和平，就必须坚决用武力来打倒蒋介石，就必须坚决拥护人民解放军的武装革命斗争，而决不能依靠任何和平的合法的改良的方法。蒋介石的恐怖行动给予人民的另一个严重教训，就是以蒋介石为代表之一的中国大地主大资本家集团，是坚决反对人民到底的，直到他们的最后一天。这是凶恶的豺狼，也是决不会回心向善的。值得注意：与蒋介石解散民盟和大施迫害民主分子同时，国民党的某些政客正在以华南为中心传出一种“和平”的空气，据说这个“和平”的空气，是与新近奉命出任广东省政府主席的宋子文，以及不久以前奉命发表谈话反苏吓美的南京政府副主席孙科等人有联系的。但是这些招摇撞骗的阴谋家们，未免把人民太看傻了，每一个有常识的人，不能不警觉到为什么这些“和平”使者甚至于不敢利用民主同盟作为他们的同盟者，却宁可扯出宋子文、孙科等辈这样的烂旗子来呢？这难道不是因为他们具有不可告人的阴谋，害怕人们的声张和反对吗？这难道不是证明了中国大地主大资本家集团连同他们的主子美国侵略者，无论到什么时候，无论穿上什么服装，总是决心要反对中国人民吗？因此中国人民要有自由，要有真正的和平，就必须坚决粉碎他们的政治阴谋，如同粉碎他们的军事进攻一样，把自己的革命事业贯彻到底。民盟方面现在应该得到教训：任何对美国侵略者及蒋介石统治集团或其中某些派别的幻想，都是无益于自己与人民的，应当清除这种幻想，而坚决地站到真正的人民民主革命方面来。中间的道路是没有的。如果民盟能够这样做，则民盟之被蒋介石宣布为非法并不能损害民盟，却反而给民盟以走向较之过去更为光明的道路的可能性。（陕北五日电）
