　　Thousands Join the Army in Pingshun in One Day
    [This newspaper's Pingshun news] After one day of mobilization in various districts on the 14th, 1,300 people throughout the county have signed up to join the army. On the 15th, the new soldiers who have been reviewed by various district villages are being gathered for a final review. Under the general slogan of "Fight to Nanjing, capture Chiang Kai-shek alive," the movement is developing extremely rapidly throughout the county. At a meeting of village cadres in the Sixth District, under the encouragement of "Liberate ourselves and establish our own regime," 41 people signed up on the spot, and 16 women also signed up to be nurses. The masses in the Huaishuping community were excited by the vivid slogans of "Eat enough, thoroughly liberate ourselves, fight to Nanjing, and capture Chiang the Baldy alive," and 52 people signed up in one day. At a meeting of village cadres in the Fourth District, after enlightening discussions on how to "uproot the old roots," 50 cadres were the first to sign up. Xu Yingcai, a demobilized soldier from Beidan Village, encouraged his son, saying, "When I returned from demobilization, my mission was not completed. You must continue to complete it!" Immediately, 70 young people were moved to sign up. In one day, 230 people signed up in the entire district. In the Seventh District, under the slogan of "Capture Chiang the Baldy alive and take Yan Xishan along the way," Comrade Qin Shuangchao, a village cadre, took the lead, promoting the entire district. According to statistics from only 13 villages, 240 people signed up in one day. In the Second District, 130 people signed up overnight. Countless moving stories emerged during the movement, and many industrialists and businessmen voluntarily signed up. For example, Chang Fuhui, a worker at the Hengji Factory and a poor peasant, immediately signed up after hearing the call to join the army and immediately wrote a letter to his elder brother to join the army with him. Great attention was paid to the quality of the new soldiers. In order to maintain the purity of the class army, the review conditions of "three wants and three don'ts" were emphasized to review our own army, and voluntariness was emphasized. The new soldiers' morale was very high. For example, new soldier Yang Fazhi said, "The old roots are about to be uprooted. If we are late, we won't catch up. This is the most glorious thing. I will never go home until I capture Chiang Kai-shek alive!" (Wang Julin, Pingshun Joint Office)

　　平顺一天千人参军
    【本报平顺讯】经各区十四号一天的动员，全县已有一千三百人报名参军，十五号，已经各区村审查过的新战士，正在集中作最后一次审查。全县在“打到南京去，活捉蒋介石”的总口号下，运动开展极为迅速，六区村干部会上，在“自己翻身自己干、刨老根坐江山”的鼓动下，当场就有四十一人报名，还有十六个妇女也报名去当看护。槐树坪小区群众为“吃饭要吃够，翻身要翻透，打到南京去，活捉蒋秃头”的生动口号所激动，一天有五十二人报名。四区村干会上，经过如何“刨老根”的启发讨论后，首先有五十个干部报名。北耽车荣退军人许英才动员他儿子说：“我退伍回来，我的任务并没有完成，你一定得去继续完成它！”当下即有七十个青年感动得报了名。一天时间全区报名者二百三十人。七区在“活捉蒋秃头，捎带阎锡山”的口号下，村干秦双朝同志首起带头，推动全区，只十三个村统计一天即报名二百四十名。二区一夜就有一百三十人报名。运动中动人故事举不胜举，并有不少工商人自动报名。如恒记工厂工人常福会，是个贫农，听到参军的号召后，自己当即报了名，并立时写信唤他大哥哥一同参军。对新战士的质量大为注意，为了保持阶级武装的纯洁，强调了三要三不要的审查条件，来审查自己的武装，并强调了自愿，新战士的情绪非常高涨。如新战士杨发支说：“老根快刨倒了，再迟了就赶不上了，这是最光荣的事情，我不活捉蒋介石决不回家！”（平顺联合办公室王巨林）
