Xinhua News Agency, East China, December 12th: Belated news: In the Chiang-occupied areas of Central and Northern Jiangsu, the masses' struggle against forcible conscription by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits is expanding daily. In late August, in the Chiang area of Huaiyin, more than 1,000 young men were arrested in the urban and rural areas. On the 28th, they were driven to the canal bank, intending to transport them away by boat. The families of the conscripted men also gathered more than 1,000 people, broke through the armed cordon, and rushed to the riverbank. The crowd was packed, and the cries shook the sky. More than 1,000 conscripted men took the opportunity to escape. Chiang's bandits were enraged and arrested more than 2,000 people. The next day, the masses held a demonstration, shouting slogans of "Oppose Conscription," and smashed Chiang's township government and county government, and tore up the household registration books. Chiang's bandits hurriedly closed the city gates, and the citizens then went on strike to resist, forcing Chiang's bandits to release the arrested masses. Three hundred conscripted men near the Shu(yang)-Xin(anzhen) highway all ran away when a secret signal was given while being escorted to Shuyang city. On September 27th, Chiang's bandits in Shizhuang, Rugao, moved out in the middle of the night to conscript men, but as soon as they left the stronghold, they were discovered by civilian sentries. Immediately, gongs sounded in every village, and shouts of killing rang out in every village. More than 5,000 people from more than ten villages came to encircle and beat them, driving Chiang's bandits back to their stronghold. Ma Futi, a farmer from Maquanzhuang in Su(qian), was captured by Chiang's bandits. Thirty-odd women in the village waved iron hairpins and broadswords, drove away Chiang's bandits, and rescued Ma Futi. Xu Shiguang, a coolie from Shibao Town in Gaoyou, was surrounded by Chiang's bandits conscripting men and could not escape, so he raised a kitchen knife and violently cut his own arm. Gao Shunxing, a youth from Shiying Tongxing Township, also cut off the index fingers of both hands, vowing not to be a soldier for Chiang Kai-shek. Chen Xiaosi, a conscript from Donghai, killed a Chiang's head of the Baojia after being captured, and escaped from prison with eight other captured youths to the Liberated Area. Now, the democratic governments of Huaiyin and Huaian counties have established "Youth Reception Centers in Chiang-Occupied Areas" in the border areas, responsible for solving the living problems of the escaped youths, and introducing them to jobs or recommending them for free schooling.

　　淮阴群众反抗蒋匪抓丁
  　捣毁蒋记镇公所县政府
    【新华社华东十二日电】迟到消息：苏中苏北蒋占区群众反抓丁斗争日益扩大，八月下旬淮阴蒋区在城厢抓捕壮丁一千余名，于二十八日驱至运河边，欲用船载走时，壮丁家属亦集结千余冲过武装警戒，奔至河岸上，人群拥挤，哭声震天，千余壮丁即乘机逃光。蒋匪恼羞成怒，乱捕两千余人，次日群众即游行示威，高呼“反对抓丁”口号，将蒋记镇公所及县政府捣毁，并撕毁户口册子。蒋匪慌忙紧闭城门，市民继即罢市抵抗，迫得蒋匪只好将逮捕之群众释放。沭（阳）新（安镇）公路附近三百被抓壮丁于押往沭阳城途中，一声暗号，即全部跑光。九月二十七日如皋石庄蒋匪深夜出动抓丁，但刚出据点里许，即为民哨发觉，顿时村村锣响，庄庄喊杀，十余乡五千多群众赶来围打，直将蒋匪驱回据点。缩（迁）马圈庄农民马福提被蒋匪抓住，全庄三十余妇女挥动铁钗、大刀，将蒋匪逐走，救下马福提。高邮时堡镇苦力许士广为抓丁蒋匪包围，无法逃避，乃举起菜刀猛力砍伤自己的胳臂。实应同兴乡青年高顺兴亦砍断两手食指，誓不当蒋家兵。东海壮丁陈小四被抓后，杀死蒋保长，与八个被抓青年越狱逃奔解放区。现淮阴、淮安两县民主政府均于边沿区设立“蒋占区青年招待所”，负责解决逃来青年之生活，并介绍职业或保送免费入学。
