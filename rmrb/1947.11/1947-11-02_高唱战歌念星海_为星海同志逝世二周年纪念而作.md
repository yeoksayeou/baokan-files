Singing War Songs, Remembering Xinghai
    Written in Commemoration of the Second Anniversary of Comrade Xinghai's Death
    Ziguang

    Comrade Xinghai was a native of Guangdong, born into poverty. He worked as a laborer, subjected to oppression and exploitation, experiencing the bitterness of the world. He went to France, where he worked and studied in Paris for seven years, working as a restaurant servant or doing other labor. Finally, he mastered his skills and returned to his motherland on the eve of the anti-Japanese storm. He stayed in Shanghai for many years engaged in national salvation cultural work. After the War of Resistance, he went to Yan'an. In the autumn of 1940, the Central Committee sent him to the Soviet Union for further study. Unfortunately, he died of illness in the Soviet Union. Today marks the second anniversary of his death. As the autumn wind cools and the red leaves gradually fall, it cannot but evoke many feelings.

    Comrade Xinghai was one of China's greatest composers. He inherited the tradition of Nie Er, the pioneer of people's music, and cultivated brilliant flowers in the nursery of China's new music. Xinghai was Nie Er's best successor and developer. Because he possessed higher cultivation and technique than that pioneer, his works were richer and more diverse in both content and form than the former. He created many works. According to his own estimate in his "Creative Notes" written in the Soviet Union, he wrote a total of four to five hundred popular songs and short songs, dozens of artistic lyrical songs, four large choruses, two operas, two symphonies, as well as symphonic poems, tone paintings, suites, and many musical essays, criticisms, and autobiographies. The number and variety of works exceeded that of all other Chinese musicians. It was truly a dazzling array, a feast for the eyes.

    Comrade Xinghai was not only a giant in the Chinese music scene, but also an outstanding talent in France and the Soviet Union. His creative life can be roughly divided into three stages: The first stage was during his study in France. During this period, he was mainly influenced by d'Indy and Dukas. The impressionistic style and lyrical colors were extremely strong. His representative work was the instrumental piece "Wind." The second stage was after returning to China until he left Yan'an. During this period, he was mainly helped by Mr. Tao Xingzhi, devoted himself to national salvation cultural activities, and wrote hundreds of mass songs, which vibrated the Chinese music scene.

    In Yan'an in 1939 and 1940, thanks to the help of the Party, he more fully developed his creative genius. He completed four large choruses, "Production," "Yellow River," "September 18th," and "Sacrifice League," as well as the opera "March of Soldiers and Civilians" and the first half of "Fuyang River," etc. As for school songs, meeting songs, commemorative songs, and instrumental scores, they are too numerous to mention. Undoubtedly, the representative work of this period was the "Yellow River Cantata." Because it expresses the spirit of the Chinese nation and the hardships and fighting spirit of the Chinese people.

    The third stage was after going to the Soviet Union. During this period, he not only absorbed the rigor of the classical school and the boldness of the romantic school, but also was influenced by Shostakovich and Alexandrov, absorbing the new Soviet style. He completed the "National Liberation Symphony," which he had already started and had been writing for several years. This work is divided into four movements. First, it describes China's vast land and abundant resources, then the national disaster, then the leadership of the Communist Party and the awakening of the people, and finally the great counter-offensive and the triumph of victory. Its majestic spirit, precise conception, and tortuous and delicate expression can be called a world masterpiece. In terms of content, this is a revolutionary history of the Chinese nation expressed in music. In terms of form, this is the first original symphony of the Chinese people with a unique style and sentiment. In terms of technique, the first half has a strong realistic color, and the second half has a significant revolutionary romantic color. In the final movement, he used the rhythm and melody of the Lion Dance, plus Chinese-style harmony and percussion instruments, symbolizing the Chinese People's Liberation Army's army, used the Kite Dance to symbolize the air force, and used the Dragon Boat Dance to symbolize the navy. The title of this work was given by Chairman Mao himself when he was in Yan'an, when he presented the entire creative intention and the part that had been completed to the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong. In any case, this work will be a great work of Chinese people's music. It will be immortal like our nation.

    In addition, he re-arranged the instrumental part of the "Yellow River Cantata" with brand-new techniques. At the same time, after the outbreak of the German-Soviet War, he was inspired during a meeting with Comrade Dimitrov and wrote his second symphony, titled "Sacred War," which was later renamed "Annihilation." This was written under extremely difficult circumstances, lying on the wooden planks of an air-raid shelter. In addition, he planned to write a third symphony, but unfortunately, it was not completed. In this stage, his creative skills indeed reached the international level. His tone poems, tone paintings, symphonic poems, and suites such as "Man Jiang Hong" were also completed during this period. It is a pity that these works have not been collected completely and can only be introduced in the future. The representative work of this stage, needless to say, should be the "National Liberation Symphony."

    Comrade Xinghai was not only a composer but also the most outstanding conductor in China. He once conducted Beethoven's "Fifth Symphony" in the Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra. Although the Municipal Council Orchestra never allowed Chinese people to conduct because China's international status was too low, those self-proclaimed foreigners finally yielded because of Comrade Xinghai's outstanding talent.

    Comrade Xinghai not only had a serious work attitude and brilliant achievements, but also had an excellent learning spirit. He was humble and often asked others for advice, without any expert airs. For the problem of describing the desert in the "National Liberation Symphony," he once walked several miles with a camel caravan to ponder its special rhythm and sound. Comrade Xinghai's scope of study was very broad. From various Western music theories and techniques to Chinese folk songs, local operas, Peking opera, Kunqu opera, as well as Zhui opera, Luo opera, and Bangzi opera, he had considerable research. He personally copied more than 700 folk song manuscripts. He had unique insights and ingenious use and development of Chinese percussion instruments. At the same time, he prepared to study a set of Chinese harmony system, in which he had preliminary conclusions on Chinese scales, modes, and Chinese orchestration, but unfortunately, it was not completed, which can only be left to future generations.

    Comrade Xinghai was kind and amiable. Although he was past middle age, he was as innocent as a child. He loved young people very much and was enthusiastically concerned about cultivating them. He could forget food and sleep to help a young person. He was patient and tireless in teaching. Everyone who had benefited from his teachings loved him.

    Especially at this time and place to commemorate Xinghai, a melody that everyone is familiar with suddenly jumped into my mind. That is the masterpiece written by Comrade Xinghai for the Taihang military and civilians:

    "The red sun shines all over the East,
    The god of freedom is singing heartily.
    Look—
    Mothers tell their sons to fight against the Eastern bandits,
    Wives send their husbands to the battlefield.
    We are on the Taihang Mountains,
    ..."

    Because of this song, I don't know how much encouragement was given to the Taihang military and civilians. How many young men and women in the rear heard us singing this song and ran to our place behind the enemy lines in groups! Taihang Mountain is no longer just a geographical name, but also a symbol of light!

    And today, the People's Liberation Army has launched a large-scale counter-offensive, and the vast people in the liberated areas are celebrating their emancipation to gain land, democracy, and freedom. This is such an exciting thing! However, our singing has become depressed. Why is this? Even songs like "On the Taihang Mountains" are gone. What is the reason? It is not that the people don't like to sing, but that we have not written anything for them to sing! This is a matter of great shame for our musicians. If Comrade Xinghai were alive, how diligently he would work and how enthusiastically he would create to welcome the great victory of this new era! Therefore, on the occasion of commemorating the second anniversary of Comrade Xinghai's death, I hope that musicians, music workers, and all comrades who love music will take active action, create vigorously, and sing war songs to commemorate Xinghai.

    高唱战歌念星海
    为星海同志逝世二周年纪念而作
    紫光
    星海同志，广东人，出身贫寒，做过苦工，受人压迫剥削，历经人间辛酸，到了法国，在巴黎半工半读，苦学七年，兼做堂馆茶役，或其他劳作，终于学成了一身本领，于抗日大风暴的前夜返回祖国，留居上海做了多年救亡文化事业，抗战后到延安，一九四○年秋天，中央派他赴苏留学深造，不幸竟因病在苏逝世，今天他已逝世两周年了，当此秋风已凉，红叶渐落之时，不尽使人有多少感慨呵。
    星海同志是中国最伟大的作曲家之一。他继承了人民音乐的开路先锋——聂耳的传统，在中国新音乐的苗圃里，培植了灿烂的花卉。星海是聂耳最好的继承者与发挥者。由于他比那位先驱者具备了更高的修养和技术，所以在作品的内容与形式方面，都比前者更丰富更多样一些。他的作品很多，据他自己在苏联写的“创作杂记”上的估计，总共写了四五百首大众歌曲和短歌，几十首艺术抒情歌，四部大合唱，两部歌剧，两套交响乐，以及交响诗、音画，组曲和许多音乐论文批评，以及自传等。作品之多，样式之繁，超过中国的一切音乐家。那真是琳琅满目，美不胜收。
    星海同志不但是中国乐坛的巨匠，就是在法国，在苏联，也是杰出的人才。他的创作生活，大致可以分为三个阶段：第一阶段是在法国留学时期。这时期主要是受德印第与杜卡斯二人的影响，印象派的风格与抒情的色彩极浓。代表作是器乐曲“风”。第二阶段是回国后一直到离开延安时期。这时期主要是受了陶行知先生的帮助，投身于救亡文化活动，前后共写了几百首群众歌曲，振动了中国乐坛。
    一九三九年、四○年在延安时期，由于党的帮助，他更充分地发挥了创作天才。完成“生产”“黄河”“九一八”“牺盟”等四部大合唱，歌剧“军民进行曲”及“滏阳河”的前半部等。至于校歌、会歌、纪念歌以及乐器曲谱，实在不胜枚举。无疑地，这个时期的代表作，首推“黄河大合唱”。因为它表现了中华民族的气派，与中国人民的艰难和斗争精神。
    第三阶段是到苏联后。这个时期他不但吸收了古典派的谨严与浪漫派的豪放，而且受了萧斯塔可维契与阿力山大洛夫等的影响，吸取了苏联新的风格。他完成了早已开始而且已经写了好几年的“民族解放交响乐”。这部作品共分四个乐章，先写中国地大物博，然后写民族灾难，再后写共产党的领导与人民的觉醒，最后写大反攻与胜利的凯旋。其气魄之雄伟，构思之精密，表现之曲折细腻，堪称为世界杰作。从内容上说，这是一部用音乐来表示的中华民族革命史，从形式上说，这是中国人民第一部自己的独创，而且是具有特殊风格与情调的交响乐。在手法上，前半是写实主义色彩浓厚，后半是革命的浪漫主义色彩显著。他在最后的乐章中，用狮子舞曲的节奏旋律，加上中国气派的和声与打击乐器，象征着中国人民解放军的陆军，用纸鸢舞曲象征空军，用龙船舞曲象征海军。这部作品的标题，是他在延安时的，将全部创作意图以及过去完成的一部分，呈献给中国人民的伟大领袖——毛泽东同志时，经毛主席亲自命名的。无论从那一方面讲，这部作品将是中国人民音乐的伟大的著作。它将与我们的民族一样，永垂不朽。
    此外他又用崭新的技巧，重新编配了“黄河大合唱”的器乐部分。同时，当德苏战争爆发后，他在一次与季米特洛夫同志的会见中，得到了启示，写出了第二部交响乐，标题是“神圣之战”，后来又改名“歼灭”。这是在极困难的情形下，伏在防空壕的木板上写成的。此外他计划写第三部交响乐，但可惜没有完成。在这一阶段，他的创作技巧，的确达到了国际水平。他的音诗、音画、交响诗，以及“满江红”等组曲，也是这个时期完成的。只可惜这些作品，还没有搜集齐，只有等待将来再作介绍。他这个阶段的代表作，不消说应该是“民族解放交响乐”了。
    星海同志不仅是个作曲家，而且是中国最优秀的指挥家。他曾经在上海工部局管弦乐队指挥过悲多汶的“第五交响乐”。虽然因为中国的国际地位太低，工部局乐队从来不准中国人进去指挥，但由于星海同志卓越的才能，那些自命不凡的洋人，也终于屈就了。
    星海同志不但工作态度严肃，成绩辉煌，而且学习精神极好。他虚怀若谷，经常向别人请教，毫无专家架子。为了“民族解放交响乐”中描写沙漠的问题，有一次他竟然随着骆驼队步行了好几里路，琢磨其特殊的节奏与音响。星海同志的学习范围很广。从西洋的各种音乐理论技术，到中国的民歌小调、地方剧、皮簧剧、昆曲、以及坠子、洛子、梆子等，他都有相当研究。他亲手抄的民歌手稿，现在就有七百多首之多。他对于中国的打击乐器更有独到的见解和天才的运用与发挥。同时他准备研究一套中国和声体系，其中对中国音阶、调式，和中国的配器法，都有了初步结论，但可惜未能完成，这只有待诸后来者了。
    星海同志的为人忠厚和蔼。他虽然年纪已过中年，但他却天真得象一个儿童。他非常爱护青年，而且热诚关心培养青年。他为了帮助一个青年，可以废寝忘食。他循循善诱，诲人不倦。凡是受过他的教益的，没有不爱戴他的。
    尤其是在此时此地来纪念星海，我的脑子里就悠然跳出了一个大家唱得烂熟的旋律来。那就是星海同志为我们太行军民写下的杰作：
    “红日照遍了东方，
    自由之神在纵情歌唱。
    看吧——
    母亲叫儿打东洋，
    妻子送郎上战场。
    我们在太行山上，
    ……”
    由于这支歌曲，不知道给了我们太行军民多少鼓舞，大后方多少男女青年，听到了我们唱着这支歌曲，成群结队的向敌后方我们这里跑呵，太行山已经不只是个地理名词，而且是个光明的象征呵！
    而今天，人民解放军已大举反攻，解放区广大的人民，正在翻身将为获得土地，民主与自由而庆贺，这是多么令人兴奋的事呵，但是，我们的歌声却消沉了，这是为什么呢？连“太行山上”那样的歌声也没有了；这是什么原因呢？不是人民不喜欢唱，而是我们没写给他们能歌唱的东西呵，这是我们音乐工作者万分惭愧的事，星海同志如在世，他将会如何勤劳的工作，如何热情的创作来接迎这新时期的伟大胜利啊，因此，当此纪念星海同志逝世二周年之时，我希望音乐家们，音乐工作者，以及一切热爱音乐的同志们，积极行动起来，大力创作、高唱战歌，纪念星海。
