　　Xiaogeliao Seizes Time for Major Labor Transformation
  　Promotes Mass Initiative
  　Integrates Transportation, Textile Production, and Manure Collection
    [Our Newspaper, Xingtai News] In Xiaogeliao Village, Eighth District, the autumn harvest was completed, and peanuts and persimmons were properly gathered. The women also collected 1,000 jin of wild vegetables. During the final tidying up, several lax attitudes were discovered. For example, Wang Aiyue said, "This year was so busy, I didn't even have time to eat. I'm not doing anything this winter, I'm going to repair my house and rest for a few days." Wang Shunlin said, "This year I put in a lot of effort. In the winter, I'll gather some firewood and pick up some manure, but I won't do anything else." Wang Qingquan and Wang Zhaoshuan were both bachelors who had more than enough to eat and were content, saying, "We're fine on our own. We won't starve even if there's a three-year drought." At the same time, Wang Zengyi and others requested to buy livestock for transportation; all the women requested to spin yarn so they wouldn't have to buy cloth. Comrade Cao Xingjun, a labor hero, based on this, convened a meeting of cadres and team leaders to discuss the situation. They concluded that the masses had two signs of laxity and three demands. The two signs of laxity were: 1. They had put in a lot of effort this year and wanted to rest; 2. The bachelors were content and didn't want to do anything. The three demands were: 1. To collect firewood and manure; 2. To engage in transportation and construction; 3. To engage in textile production to solve the problem of clothing. Comrade Xingjun proposed the policy of turning the three demands into three tasks, and overcoming laxity. Everyone unanimously agreed and put forward the following slogan: "Firewood and manure are like gold, but only for those who labor!" Specific plans were made: The entire village of 240 people would collect six jin of firewood per person per day, totaling 300,280 jin (market weight) by the end of April next year. There were 110.4 mu of dry land, and each mu would receive 45 dan of manure, totaling 4,950 dan, all of which had to be collected this winter. On the transportation front, the slogan was: "Draw people into transportation to earn money, so we can build well next spring!" Eight donkeys and three mules were organized. The village had enough peanuts and persimmons for ten trips, and also contracted for two trips in other villages, totaling twelve trips, which could earn 739,200 yuan. In terms of construction, the plan for this winter was to build a water-powered cotton gin and cotton batting machine room before the 15th day of the tenth lunar month. To encourage the masses, Xingjun proposed: "This year's plan must be realized, the water mill will be completed before wheat harvest, and the water-powered gin, cotton batting, and spinning will be done after the autumn harvest." Some people felt that there were too many tasks this winter and they couldn't handle them all. Everyone studied and came up with a plan to organize and ensure that three things were not neglected: repair and construction would use construction work points, a major labor transformation, transporters would receive a full work point for each day, collecting 150 jin of firewood at home would be worth a full work point, and the whole village would invest labor in repairing the machine room, with whoever repaired the machine room for the transporters receiving one work point for each day. Now the masses have great enthusiasm and started on the 21st day of the ninth lunar month.

　　小戈寥抓紧时间大变工
  　发扬群众积极要求
  　运输纺织同时积肥
    【本报邢台讯】八区小戈寥村，三秋完成，并将花生、柿子收拾妥当，妇女还打野菜一千斤。最后收拾零活中，发现了几种松懈思想，如王爱月说：“今年忙的可不轻，连吃饭的空都没有，我冬天什么也不干了，修修我的房子，休息几天。”王顺林说：“今年出力不轻，冬天打点柴，拾点粪，不干别的了。”王清泉、王兆拴都是光棍汉，达到了耕一余一，自满的说：“咱一个人不管怎样也够了，大旱三年也饿不死咱。”同时王增义等一部分人要求买牲口运输；整个妇女都要求纺织不买布穿。劳英曹兴俊同志据此，召开了干部组长会研究。研究出群众有两松懈三要求，两松懈是：１、一年出力不轻，想休息；２、光棍汉自满，不想动了。三要求是：１、打柴积肥；２、运输建设；３、搞纺织解决穿布。兴俊同志提出方针是：三要求变成三干，克服松懈。大家一致同意，提出以下口号：“柴粪似黄金，但等劳动人！”订了具体计划：全村二百四十口人，一人一天六斤柴，计算到明年四月底共烧柴三十万零二千八百斤（市秤），有旱地一百一十亩四分，每亩上四十五担粪，共四千九百五十担，今冬都要弄够。在运输上，提出口号是：“抽人运输把钱赚，咱们明春好修建！”现组织起八个驴，三条骡子，本村有花生、柿子够十趟运，又在外村包运两次，共十二次，能赚洋七十三万九千二百元。在建设上，今冬计划在旧历十月十五前盖一座水打弹花机和轧花机房。兴俊为鼓励群众，提出：“今年计划要实现，麦前水磨已盖完，秋后水打机，弹花和纺线。”又打柴、又运输、又建设，有的群众感到今冬活多顾不过来。大家又研究出组织起来三不误：修盖是使用修建晌票，大变工，运输人一工顶一个工，在家打柴市秤一百五十斤顶一个工，修机房全村劳力平均入股谁替运输人修机房一工顶一工。现在群众劲头很大，在旧历九月二十一日已经下手。
