　　Capture Chiang Kai-shek to Protect Our Fruits
  　Uproot the Source of Disaster for a Great Transformation
    250 People in Huguan's Fifth District Sign Up in One Day
    [This newspaper's Huguan dispatch] The slogan "Attack Nanjing and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive" spread like wildfire throughout the Fifth District on the 7th. Emancipated youths enthusiastically joined the army to defend their fruits of victory. Li Jinshan, an emancipated peasant from Liuzhe Village, said: "Joining the victorious army to capture old Chiang in Nanjing is to eliminate the root of our troubles. I'm old, so I'll send my son!" He personally sent his two sons, Li Dousong, to sign up for the army. Ma Baohai and Ma Cai, public security officers from Linqing Village, eagerly signed up, saying: "Our village has had a small emancipation, but overthrowing Chiang Kai-shek is a great emancipation. If we capture Chiang Kai-shek, we peasants will also rule the world..." Guo Ye, a woman from Dananshan, personally encouraged her husband to join the army. Wang Futai from Dinantou said: "My brother joined the army last year and made great contributions. I'll join the army and compare who is more meritorious in killing the enemy." Under the belief of "Capturing Chiang Kai-shek to Uproot the Source of Disaster," parents sent their sons, wives encouraged their husbands, cadres took the lead, and youths competed with each other. On the 7th, 250 youths signed up for the army in one day. Each village also established a "Join the Army to Capture Chiang" committee, with household registration and review sections, to strictly verify whether applicants were our own soldiers. The landlord Niu Shuwen repeatedly requested to join the army, but he was not approved by the masses and could not join. The army recruitment movement is developing vigorously throughout the district. (Su Li)
