　　Everyone Has a Share in Capturing the Traitor Chiang
  　Middle and Primary School Students Request to Enlist
    [Our Newspaper's Comprehensive Report] Encouraged by the nationwide victorious counter-offensive "March on Nanjing, Capture Chiang Kai-shek Alive!" and the enthusiastic enlistment of liberated masses in various regions, many young students have put down their books, left their classrooms, and rushed to the front lines. They said, "If we don't contribute now, when will we!" Zhang Tianhe, Ji Mingzhe, and twenty other students from Zhangbin Middle School jointly submitted a request to the school authorities to join the army. When the Party's General Branch Committee and the New Democratic Youth League called on Party members and League members to go to the front lines at a school-wide meeting, sixty-seven male and female students immediately raised their hands to volunteer. Yang Sanzhu's older brother died in battle at the front, and he requested to go to the front lines to avenge his brother. Zhang Yimin said, "My father has already crossed the river, and I want to follow him." Under the sentiment of "Only by overthrowing Chiang Kai-shek can we study properly," students from Neiqiu Second High School, such as Shi Boxue, Zhao Shengliang, and Yang Qiusheng, took the lead in enlisting, followed by seventy students who jumped out of the venue, wanting to go to the front lines. Some younger students were told, "You are too young to go." They replied, "Even if we can't carry a rifle, we can be small nurses." Female students such as Li Xiufang were afraid they wouldn't be allowed to go, so they all said, "Now men and women are equal; if you don't let us go, it's unfair. Even if we can't carry a rifle, we can take care of the wounded and sick, and we can sew shoes and socks, we must go anyway." Influenced by the enlistment of Jin Shuanzhu, Chang Chengxi, and Liu Huaiyou, thirty-one students from Xiangyuan Normal School and First High School have signed up for the front lines. Li Shuiwang, Yang Zhengqi, and Li Yongyin, outstanding students from Taihang Second Middle School, voluntarily requested to go to the front lines, and the entire class requested to join the army. After repeated explanations by the leaders, primary school students Cao Dongsheng and Gong Dequan even cried and said, "If we can't be soldiers, can't we be orderlies?" Tang Chaoyuan and twenty other students from Daming Taichen Middle School joined the army, saying, "We swear not to return home until Chiang Kai-shek is overthrown." In the upsurge of enlistment at Jingxing Second High School, Li Bingyin took the lead in signing up, saying, "I have long been prepared to join the army on the revolutionary front lines." Shi Menggeng's older brother had already signed up, but he insisted on going as well. After teacher Liang Shugong signed up, the masses said that his family couldn't do without him and that he was nearsighted, so they cancelled his name. He ran to the city and signed up again, saying, "My eyesight is poor, and I can't aim, but I believe there is always work for me to do in the army." Fifty-one teachers and students from Lincheng Second High School signed up. After strict review, the children of landlords and households who had ideological problems were removed, and the female students and primary school students were screened out, leaving only thirteen qualified. Sun Shiyuan, Hu Zhenchuan, Yang Shutian, and sixteen other students from Wu'an Normal School voluntarily signed up, and the female students competed to wash their clothes and sew cloth bags for them.
