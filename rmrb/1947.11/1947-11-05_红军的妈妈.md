    Red Army's Mother
    Ke Gang
    On August 28th, a brigade of the Liberation Army advanced bravely through the heavy morning fog. Passing through a small mountain village called Fengbeilou, fifty li from Huangchuan along the Huangshang Highway, the village was surrounded on three sides by verdant pine-covered hills, with a few white geese loudly calling in the green water ponds.

    The troops stopped to prepare a meal, but there was no sound of people or smoke from the chimneys in the entire village. Someone found a slogan left over from the Soviet era eighteen years ago under the eaves of a house. The blurred words read:
    "Confiscate the land of landlords and local tyrants and distribute it to poor peasants."
    Everyone couldn't help but clamor, "If this is an old revolutionary area, why have all the villagers run away? Don't they know that our former Red Army has returned?"
    Suddenly someone shouted:
    "Where's the instructor? There's an old lady here, she's the instructor's mother."
    The instructor turned around and saw that soldier Niu Baosan from the seventh squad was helping an old woman without eyeballs to walk towards him, followed by a five or six-year-old girl. From fifty meters away, he could see her lips trembling, and only when he got closer did he hear her constantly muttering:
    "Fourth company, fourth company instructor."
    Niu Baosan said, "Old mother, this is the instructor." "Yes, I am the instructor." Instructor Ma took a step closer, and the old woman was silent. Suddenly, she stretched out her hands and touched the instructor from head to toe, then anxiously said loudly:
    "Wu Hai, don't you recognize your mother?"
    The instructor said seriously, "Old mother, I'm not Wu Hai.
    My name is Ma." The old woman immediately let go. Anxiously she asked, "Aren't you the fourth company instructor?"
    "I am the fourth company instructor."
    "Aren't you the Red Army that left here in the eighteenth year of the Republic?"
    "I am that Red Army, and I'm back."
    "Then you're not Wu Hai? My Wu Hai was the instructor of the fourth company of the Fourth Red Army. He was exactly twenty years old when he left."
    "I'm not Wu Hai, I'm only twenty-three years old this year."
    The old woman sat on the ground like a child and cried in disappointment. All the soldiers of the company gathered around to try to comfort her. The instructor sat opposite her very kindly and said, "Old mother, don't be sad. Although I'm not Wu Hai, I'm just like Wu Hai. Whatever you want Wu Hai to do, we'll do it for you. Now we have hundreds of thousands of Red Army soldiers. Back then, Wu Hai was the instructor of the fourth company, but now we have thousands upon thousands of fourth companies, tens of millions of Wu Hais have returned."
    The old woman sighed and said, "I want Wu Hai to come back and avenge us. Since he left, the militia in the bay has caused the extermination of entire families, and the women of the women's association have been ravaged enough by those beasts, then tied up and thrown into the pond. People hang themselves in the Songshu Village behind the ridge every day. Wu Hai's father was hacked to death, and my eyeballs were gouged out with bamboo tubes." As she spoke, the old woman touched her eye sockets and cried again. "Old mother, don't cry, we will definitely avenge you!" the soldiers replied in unison. Someone suddenly interjected and asked, "Old mother, you have suffered such great disasters, now that our troops have returned, why have all the people in your village run away?" The old woman reached into her pocket and handed a piece of paper to the instructor. The instructor read aloud:
    "Anyone who meets with the Communists will have their entire family killed..."
    The old mother continued: "The head of the bao forced every household to write this at the beginning of last month! I risked my life to stay at home and wait for my Wu Hai to come back and tell him about the grievances!" The instructor quickly said to her, "Old mother, don't be afraid, we have a lot of troops, and they are heading this way. Your Wu Hai is still behind, we won't leave anymore." The old woman suddenly stood up and immediately told the little girl beside her, "Go to the ridge and tell your mother to come back, just say: 'The Red Army is not leaving, hurry up, good child.'" The little girl stood breathlessly under the big pine tree on the ridge, shouting loudly:
    'Mothers and aunties, come back quickly! The Red Army is not leaving.'"
    The voice resounded like a small loudspeaker, and groups of men, women, children, and old people emerged from the dense pine forest.

    红军的妈妈
    柯岗
    八月二十八日大队解放军在浓重的晨雾里勇猛进击。路过潢川五十华里傍着潢商公路有一座小的山庄，名叫冯北楼，这村被长满了青松的邱陵三面环抱，绿水池塘里几只白鹅，在拉开嗓子高叫。
    队伍停下来准备造饭，全村却没有人声也无炊烟。有人在一座房檐下，发现了十八年前，苏维埃时代残留着的标语。字迹模糊写的是：
    “没收地主豪绅的土地分给贫苦农民”。
    大家不禁喧嚷起来：“既是老革命地区，为啥老乡们都跑了呢？难道他们不知道咱是从前的红军回来了吗？”
    忽然有人大叫起来：
    “指导员在那里？这里有个老太太，她是指导员的妈妈”。
    指导员转身一看，七班战士牛保三正扶着一位没有眼珠子的老妈妈向这边走来，一个五、六岁的女孩子跟在后面。在五十公尺之外就看到她的嘴唇在颤动，走到跟前才听到她喋喋不休的念着：
    “四连，四连指导员。”
    牛保三说：“老妈妈这就是指导员”。“是呀我就是指导员”。马指导员挨近一步，老人不做声突然伸出双手，从指导员头顶一直摸到脚跟，然后很着急的大声说：
    “吴海，难道你不认识娘啦”。
    指导员很认真的说：老妈妈我不是吴海。
    我姓马。老人立即放手。急燥的追问：“你不是四连指导员？”
    “我是四连指导员”。
    “你不是民国十八年从这里出去那红军？”
    “我就是那个红军又回来了”。
    “那你不是吴海？俺吴海是红四军四连指导员，他走的时候整二十岁”。
    “我不是吴海，我今年才二十三岁”。
    老人象孩子似的“哇”的一声坐在地上失望的痛哭起来了。全连的战士都拢来想尽办法来劝慰她，指导员很亲热的和她对面坐着说：“老妈妈不要难过，我虽然不是吴海，可是也象吴海一样，你想叫吴海做啥，我们替你做啥。现在咱红军有几百万人啦，那时候吴海做四连指导员，现在咱有几千几万个四连，几千万个吴海都回来了”。
    老人长嘘了一口气说：“要吴海回来给俺报仇。自从他走后，湾子里叫民团闹得灭门绝户，妇会的人叫那些禽兽们糟踏够了，又反绑着手投到池塘啦。岭后松树村里天天有人上吊。吴海他爸被砍死啦，我的眼珠子叫人家用竹筒给拧掉啦。”老人说着，用手摸着眼眶又哭了。“老妈妈别哭啦，这仇咱们一定替你报！”战士们异口同声的回答她。不知是谁忽然插问道：“老妈妈你们受了这大的灾，咱队伍回来了，你们村里的人怎么都跑了呢？”老人顺手从衣袋里掏出一张纸条交给指导员。指导员高声念着：
    “谁和共产党见面，杀绝满门……”。
    老妈妈接着说：这是上月初保长逼着家家户户写的呀！我是拼死留在家等俺吴海回来要把冤仇给他说说呀！”指导员连忙对她说：“老妈妈不怕，咱队伍多的很，正往这边开哩，你吴海还在后边，咱再不走啦。”老人忽然站起来，立刻告诉身边的小女孩说：“去到岭后叫你妈都回来，你就说：‘红军不走，快去吧好孩子’。小女孩气喘喘的站在岭脉上的大松树下，用力的喊着：
    ‘妈妈婶婶，你们都快回来吧！红军不走啦。’
    这声音样小喇叭似的响亮着，茂密的松树林内走出了成群的男人女人孩子和老人。
