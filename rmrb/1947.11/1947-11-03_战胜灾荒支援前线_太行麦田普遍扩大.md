Overcoming Disaster and Supporting the Front Lines
    Wheat Fields Universally Expanded in Taihang
    [Report from our newspaper in Taihang, 31st] To overcome natural disasters and support the front lines, the counties in the western Taihang region have universally expanded their wheat fields by 30% to 40% compared to last year, accounting for 35% of the total land area. The ten counties of Zuoquan, Yushe, and Wuxiang have expanded their wheat fields by a total of 240,000 mu, an increase of 33% compared to last year's 734,000 mu. In many districts and villages in Changzhi, Licheng, and Lucheng, wheat fields have expanded to 50% of the total land area. Changzhuang Village in Lucheng has planted a total of 3,320 mu of wheat, accounting for 53% of the total land area, more than double that of last year. Songshuping in Zuoquan has expanded its wheat fields by fourteen times compared to last year, planting 7 mu last year and 100 mu this year under the slogan "Listening to the government will not lead to losses." Baitou Village in Changzhi has also expanded from 350 mu last year to 1,100 mu. Heshun and Xiyang counties, which have traditionally not grown wheat or grown very little, have also expanded their wheat fields under the disaster relief slogan of "Early planting, early harvest, no worries about food and drink next spring and summer." Xiyang's wheat fields have expanded by three and a half times compared to last year, with a minimum target of planting 75,000 mu, reaching a standard of at least 0.5 mu of wheat land per person. Heshun has already planted 40,000 mu, with the fourth district alone planting 5,400 mu, and is still expanding rapidly. The ten-plus counties in the eastern front, such as Shahe, Xingtai, Linxian, and Wu'an, have expanded by 20% to 30% compared to last year, accounting for 50% to 70% of the total land area. The four counties of Wu'an, Shahe, Neiqiu, and Gaoyi alone have expanded by 520,000 mu compared to last year. Along the Daokou-Qinghua railway line in the south, the four counties of Qinyang, Bo'ai, and Xiuwu have wheat fields accounting for over 80% of the total land area. Xiuwu's fourth district has expanded by over 10,000 mu compared to last year, with an average of 6 mu of wheat planted per person. Various difficulties were overcome in wheat planting. This year, there was a general lack of summer rain in various places, and most of the autumn harvests were late, making it impossible to catch up with wheat planting. The seven counties of Cixian, Wu'an, Shahe, and Linxian took the lead in breaking the old habits and waiting mentality of "Plowing after the wheat harvest, no plowing, no growth" and "Can still catch up after the autumn harvest," and proposed "Early planting, early rooting, late planting reduces yield, short time with cloudy and damp weather, organize and rush to work," overcoming all difficulties, increasing the construction of single-legged plows, and planting wheat in the ridges of late crops. According to incomplete statistics from 83 villages in the above seven counties, over 200 single-legged wheat plows were added within half a month under the slogan "Planting wheat in ridges is a model, not planting is lazy," and 120,735 mu were planted in ridges. Under the leadership of production brigade leader Zhang Huzhu, Chunshan Village in Cixian proposed "People rest, plows don't rest, take turns eating quickly to plant wheat," and planted 2,300 mu in ridges in twelve days, with each person and each plow planting at least 16 mu. In many villages in Xingtai, valley-point planting was promoted, with 80% of the wheat fields in Huangsi Village being point-planted. Before wheat planting, each county conducted detailed surveys of poor peasants, hired laborers, orphans, widows, military dependents, and newly freed households lacking land, fertilizer, seeds, and labor. Under the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation, embodying "All farmers under heaven are one family," cooperatives also worked hard to help, thoroughly solving the difficulties of the poor peasants and hired laborers. The first branch of the Jinnan Bank loaned 50 million yuan to five counties, including Neiqiu, Lincheng, and Zanhuang, solving the wheat planting difficulties of poor peasants and hired laborers. In order to help poor peasants and hired laborers expand their wheat fields, the Xiyang County government distributed 300 shi of wheat seeds and 10 million yuan of Jichaopiao. Farmers in over 40 villages in Gaoyi, Lincheng, Zanhuang, and Shahe lent 182 shi and 4 dou of wheat seeds to 782 poor peasants, newly freed households, orphans, and widows. Three villages, including Zhongwangzhuang in Shahe, adjusted 173 mu of land suitable for wheat planting for poor peasants and proposed "Land that has been separated for three years is yang soil (wall soil, pit soil), exchanging soil, one mu yields five shi," "Chicken feathers and garlic skins, miscellaneous things, go to the land and grow good crops," and mobilized a large amount of fertilizer production. In addition to this, many villages, such as Changzhuang in Shahe and Lijiazhuang in Lincheng, distributed the sesame cakes stored in the cooperative to poor peasants without compensation, and the cooperative's sheep flocks also fertilized the land for the poor peasants. In solving the labor shortage, in addition to exchanging labor and lending cooperative livestock to poor peasants for wheat planting, the landlords' labor was also unified and organized to let the landlords plant wheat for the poor peasants to repay their blood and sweat debts. Because these difficulties were solved, 60% of the total land area was planted with wheat. After the difficulties of 69 poor peasant households in three villages, including Nanwang in Shahe, were resolved, they planted another 113 mu, with an average of 2 mu of wheat planted per person. They happily said: "We will do a good job in sideline occupations this winter, earn money to survive the spring famine, and when the wheat comes down in May, we will not be afraid of going hungry."

    战胜灾荒支援前线
    太行麦田普遍扩大
    【本报太行三十一日电】太行各地为战胜灾荒，支援前线，西线各县普遍比去年扩大麦田百分之三十至四十，占土地总数的百分之三十五。左权、榆社、武乡等十县共扩大麦田二十四万亩，较去年七十三万四千亩增加百分之三十三，长治、黎城、潞城不少区村的麦田扩大到土地总数的百分之五十，潞城常庄村共种麦三千三百二十亩，占土地总数的百分之五十三，超过去年一倍，左权松树坪比去年麦田扩大了十四倍，去年种麦七亩，今年在“听政府话吃不了亏”的口号下，种了一百亩。长治百头村也由去年三百五十亩扩大到一千百。向来不种麦或种麦很少的和顺、昔阳等县，也在“早种早收，明年春夏吃喝不愁”的渡灾口号下扩大了麦田，昔阳麦田比去年扩三倍半，最少要种七万五千亩，达到每人最少平均五分麦地的准标。和顺已下种四万亩，仅四区即种了五千四百亩，现仍突击扩大中。东线沙河、邢台、林县、武安等十余县，比去年扩大百分之廿至三十，占土地总面积的百分之五十至七十。仅武安、沙河、内邱、高邑四县即比去年扩大五十二万亩。南部道清沿线之沁阳、博爱、修武等四县麦田占土地总数的百分之八十以上，修武四区比去年扩大了万余亩，每人平均种麦六亩。在种麦中各战胜了不少困难，今年各地普遍缺夏雨，大部是晚秋，收秋后就赶不上种麦子。磁县、武安、沙河、林县等七县首先打破了“麦收犁垧，不犁不长”，“收了秋也能赶上”的旧习惯和等待思想，提出“早种早扎根，晚种减收成，天阴地湿时间短，组织起来突击干”，克服一切困难，增造独腿耧，在晚庄稼垅里串麦，据上述七县八十三个村不完全统计，半月内在“串麦是模范，不串是懒汉”的口号下，增造了二百余个一条腿麦耧，串麦十二万零七千八百卅五亩。磁县春山村在生产大队长张虎柱领导下，提出“人歇耧不歇，换班吃饭快种麦”，十二天串种了二千三百亩，每人每个耧最少串十六亩。邢台不少村庄推行了谷地点种，皇寺村百分之八十的麦田是点种的。种麦前各县对贫雇、孤寡、军属和新翻身缺地、缺肥料、缺种籽、缺劳力户做了详细的调查，在“天下农民是一家”发扬互助互济的精神下，合作社也努力帮助，彻底解决了贫雇困难。冀南银行一分行将五千万元贷给内邱、临城、赞皇等五个县，解决了贫雇种麦困难，昔阳县府为帮助贫雇扩大麦田，发放了麦种三百石，冀钞一千万元，高邑、临城、赞皇、沙河四十余个村庄的农民，给七百八十二户贫雇、新翻身户、孤寡借出麦种一百八十二石四斗，沙河中王庄等三村，给贫雇调剂出可种麦地一百七十三亩，并提出“离地三年为阳土（墙土坑土），土换土一亩打石五”，“鸡毛蒜皮，胡七杂八，上到地里长好庄稼”等，发动大量造肥外，沙河常庄、临城李家庄等许多村庄还将合作社存的麻饼，无代价分配给贫雇，合作社的羊群又给贫雇卧地。在解决劳力困难上，除工换工与合作社牲口借给贫雇种麦外，还将地主劳力统一组织起来，让地主给贫雇种麦，还血汗帐。由于解决了这些困难，就种了土地总数百分之六十的麦田，沙河南汪等三村六十九家贫雇困难解决后，又多种了一百一十三亩，每人平均种麦二亩，他们高兴的说：“今年冬天好好搞副业，赚下钱渡春荒，五月下来麦子，就不怕饿肚了。”
