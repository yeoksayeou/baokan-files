    Ground Frozen, Plowing Impossible, Transitioning to Winter Production
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 28th] As the weather turns cold and the ground freezes, plowing in various areas has now stopped, and everyone is transitioning to winter production. According to reports from Qinshui and Hongtong, most of the autumn land has been plowed within the past half-month. Taking the fourth district of Hongtong as an example, out of the district's 35,295 mu of autumn land, except for 6,560 mu of cotton fields that have not been plowed, the rest has been plowed entirely. In the fourth district of Qinshui, out of the district's 47,644 mu, nearly 40,000 mu have been plowed. In previous years, only a small portion of the land was plowed, but this year most of it has been plowed, which will greatly increase harvests next year. The reason why it was possible to complete the plowing in such a short period of time is mainly due to the organization of all manpower and animal power, with some plowing and others hoeing. Puchaocun Village in Qinshui organized all 398 able-bodied and semi-able-bodied men and women in the village, including 24 women with bound feet and 12 elderly women, and plowed all 1,500 mu of autumn land in the village within six days. Among them, manual plowing accounted for 236 mu, and manual hoeing accounted for 643 mu, totaling more than half. Now, each district is calling for a transition to winter production: (1) Carrying charcoal and chopping firewood to prepare for firewood for this winter and next spring, ensuring that spring plowing next year is not hindered by difficulties in obtaining firewood; (2) Storing livestock grass to ensure that livestock have enough to eat until the wheat harvest next year; (3) Accumulating fertilizer early to lay the foundation for increased production next year; (4) Organizing women to spin and weave, with women aged twelve to fifty spinning ten jin of cotton each from the eleventh month of the lunar calendar to the end of February next year.

    地冻不能再垡转入冬季生产
    【本报太岳廿八日电】天寒地冻，各地垡地现已停止，纷纷转入冬季生产。据沁水、洪洞两地报导，半月内已将秋地大部垡过，以洪洞四区说，全区三万五千二百九十五亩秋地，除花地六千五百六十亩未垡完，其余已全部垡过。沁水四区全区四万七千六百四十四亩，垡地将近四万亩。往年垡地者仅一小部分，今年大部垡过，明年即可大量增加收成。其所以能在极短期间内垡完，主要是组织了所有人力、畜力，犁的犁刨的刨，沁水蒲潮村组织了全村男女全半劳力三百九十八人，并有小脚妇女廿四人，老太太十二人，六天内即将全村秋地一千五百亩垡完，其中仅人拉犁即垡了二百三十六亩，人刨六百四十三亩，共占一半多。现各区号召转入冬季生产：（一）担炭打柴，准备今冬明春的柴火，保证明年春耕不受柴炭困难；（二）积存畜草，保证牲口吃到明年麦收以后；（三）及早积肥，以打下明年增产的基础；（四）组织妇女纺织，十二岁至五十岁的妇女，自阴历十一月起到明年二月底止，每人纺花十斤。
