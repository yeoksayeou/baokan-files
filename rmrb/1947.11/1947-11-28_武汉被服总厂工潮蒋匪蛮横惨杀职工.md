　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: According to a special dispatch from the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao in Hankou: A labor strike occurred at the Wuhan Clothing Factory General Factory in Qiaokou, Hankou City, at the beginning of this month. Chiang Kai-shek's police actually shot and killed three workers. The cause of the strike was that the factory failed to issue "processing bonuses" as stipulated, only issuing a quarter of the amount that should have been issued. Moreover, the factory's ten thousand workers were dissatisfied with the factory's usual measures of mistreating workers in every possible way. On the afternoon of the 6th, the workers sent more than 100 representatives to Chiang Kai-shek's Wuhan Provisional Headquarters to petition and protest, but to no avail. When they gathered again in the afternoon to go to the Provisional Headquarters, they were shot at by Chiang Kai-shek's factory police team, and two workers were seriously injured and died after being sent to the hospital. Many workers were slightly injured. Another employee also died from a severe head wound caused by a bullet. Chiang Kai-shek's massacre has rapidly transformed the labor strike into a struggle against murderous rule. The Wuhan Chiang Kai-shek authorities have ordered martial law in the Qiaokou area to suppress the Hankou workers' movement for freedom. Furthermore, according to a Qingdao dispatch from the same newspaper: The Chiang Kai-shek Navy Shipyard's entire workforce of 800 workers recently made four demands to the shipyard due to their inability to maintain their livelihood: (1) Add 125% to wages starting from October; (2) The staple food allowance of 48 catties of flour should be converted at market price; (3) Pay wages for weekly holidays as usual; (4) Issue each person a set of cotton clothing. However, the shipyard refused the workers' reasonable demands, citing "inability to pay." The workers immediately launched a general strike on the 4th, which was still ongoing as of mid-month.

　　武汉被服总厂工潮蒋匪蛮横惨杀职工
    【新华社陕北廿六日电】据天津大公报汉口专电：汉口市桥口武汉被服总厂本月初发生工潮，蒋匪警察竟枪杀职工三名。工潮起因，为厂方未按规定发给“加工奖金，”仅发给应发数四分之一，且该厂万余工人均不满厂方平时百般虐待工人之措施，工人方面于六日下午推派代表百余人赴蒋贼武汉行辕请愿抗议，未获结果，下午再度集队去行辕时，竟遭蒋匪厂警队开枪射击，当有工人二人受重伤，送医院后即不治身死。受轻伤工人多名。另一职员亦因头部中弹受重伤而死。蒋匪之屠杀暴行，使工潮迅速转变为反抗杀人统治之斗争，武汉蒋匪当局为镇压汉口工人争自由运动，已下令于桥口一带戒严。又据该报青岛讯：蒋匪海军造船所全体工人八百余名近因无法维持生活，于本月四日向所方提出四项要求：（一）自十月份起追加工资百分之一百二十五；（二）主食费代金面粉四十八斤按市价折算；（三）星期例假照给工资；（四）每人发棉服一套。但所方借口“无力支付”，拒绝工人方面之合理要求，工人即于四日起举行全体罢工，至本月中旬仍在坚持中。
