Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 21st: According to TASS, New York: The "Foreign Press Association" held its 30th-anniversary celebration banquet on the 11th. At the meeting, Vyshinsky, following the speeches of Gu Weijun, the representative of Chiang Kai-shek to the United Nations, and Sir Shawcross, the British representative, used sharp and witty language to refute the cunning attempts of the British and Chiang representatives, winning prolonged applause from the audience. Vyshinsky refuted Gu Weijun's "two types of people" argument: one belongs to those who are easy to get along with and are prepared to cooperate, and the other implies that the Soviet Union is not easy to get along with and does not want to cooperate. Gu's statement is an attempt to create confusion and unease. Vyshinsky cited two other concepts that determine the trend of foreign policy, namely, the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy and the opposing Truman Doctrine and Marshall Plan. He quoted a speech by US Senator Brooks and sarcastically said: "According to the opinions of gentlemen like Brooks, all of America's difficulties are due to the failure of the Hitler bandits to eliminate the Soviet Union. If they had eliminated the Soviet Union, then everything would be fine. In other words, the Truman Doctrine would also be unnecessary." This is the same as the statement made by a certain famous American figure quoted by the New York Times two days after Hitler's attack on the Soviet Union: "If Germany wins, we should help the Soviet Union; if the Soviet Union wins, we should help Germany. We might as well let them fight as much as possible..." (Editor's note: According to the Central News Agency, according to the New York Times archives, the person who said this was Truman.) The two are exactly the same. At that time, Britain also had this wish, and Shawcross might be able to point out the name of a British minister who said such things." Vyshinsky continued to talk about the issue of international cooperation, saying: "It is said that the 'minority' delegations did not show a spirit of cooperation. However, before teaching us to cooperate, those who are trying to persuade us should learn to respect the UN Charter and principles. Because only on this basis is genuine cooperation possible." Vyshinsky went on to refute Shawcross's fallacy, saying: "Shawcross declared that the consolidation and development of national communism is not permissible. However, I must say that the development of communism does not depend on Mr. Shawcross's theory. Joshua (see "Old Testament" - Editor) once tried to stop the movement of the sun, saying: "Sun, stand still." But the sun continued and still continues to rise from the east and set in the west. Even the Attorney General of the United Kingdom (referring to Shawcross - Editor) cannot change its development and the laws of natural development."

### 顾维钧等信口胡扯污蔑苏联　维辛斯基尖锐驳斥

　　顾维钧等信口胡扯污蔑苏联
  　维辛斯基尖锐驳斥
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】据塔斯社纽约讯：十一日“外国报业公会”举行成立三十周年的纪念宴会。会上维辛斯基继联大蒋代表顾维钧与英代表萧洛克斯发言，以尖锐而机智之辞，驳斥英、蒋代表的奸猾企图，博得全场历久不息的欢呼。维辛斯基反驳顾维钧“两种人”的说法：一种属于易于相处并准备合作的人，另一种暗示苏联属于不易相处并不想合作的人。照顾的说法，这种人力图制造混乱和不安。维氏举出决定外交政策趋向的另外两种概念，这就是苏联和平外交政策和与此相反的杜鲁门主义及马歇尔计划。他引证美参议员布洛克斯的讲演，并讥讽说：“据布洛克斯一类大人先生们的意见，美国的一切困难，都是由于希特勒匪徒未能消灭苏联而产生的，如果他们消灭了苏联，那么一切就会美好了。换句话说，杜鲁门主义也不必要了。这和希特勒进攻苏联后两天，纽约时报曾引述美国某著名人物的言论说：“如果德国战胜，我们应助苏联；如果苏联战胜，我们应助德国。我们不妨听任他们尽量火拼……”（编者按：据中央社称，根据纽约时报的存报，说这话的就是杜鲁门。）两者如出一辙。其时英国也有这种愿望，萧洛克斯或者能够指出说这类话的英国某大臣的名字来。”维辛斯基继谈国际合作问题说：“据说‘少数’代表团未表现合作精神。但是，在教导我们合作之前，那些企图说服我们的人，应该学会尊重联合国宪章与原则。因为只有根据这一点，真正的合作才有可能。”维氏进而驳斥萧洛克斯的谬论，说：“萧洛克斯宣称：国家共产主义的巩固与发展，是不能容许的。但是，我必须说：共产主义的发展，并不是依萧克洛斯先生的理论为转移的。约书亚（见“旧约”——编者）曾企图停止太阳的运动，他说：“太阳停止升落。”但是太阳曾经继续，而且仍继续从东方升起，在西方降落。就是联合王国检察长（指萧克洛斯——编者）也不能改变它的发展及自然的发展法则。”
