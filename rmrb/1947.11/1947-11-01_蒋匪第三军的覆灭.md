Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 30th - Our reporter Yang Shuo's report on the annihilation of Chiang Kai-shek's Third Army at Qingfengdian stated: The destruction of Chiang Kai-shek's Third Army's Seventh Division and a regiment of the Sixteenth Army is another gift from the war instigator Chiang Kai-shek to the People's Liberation Army. Chiang Kai-shek, terrified by the powerful offensive of the People's Liberation Army on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, hurriedly issued several orders, driving the Third Army from Shijiazhuang day and night, risking a march to Baoding for reinforcement. Thus, Luo Lirong and Yang Guangyu led over ten thousand men into the tomb prepared for them by the People's Liberation Army – the five villages including Southwest He, 13 li east of Qingfengdian.

After Chiang Kai-shek knew that the fate of the Third Army was sealed, he still wanted to make a last-ditch struggle. Chiang's planes circled over the positions all day long, strafing and bombing. At night, the besieged villages lit firewood together, the sky still rumbled with aircraft, and flares were constantly dropped, but this was nothing more than adding some liveliness to the funeral. Under the People's Liberation Army's rapid and fierce attacks, the enemy's morale was extremely chaotic. Liu Yongchang, a political instructor of the 30th Regiment of the bandits, had already written in his diary: "The bandits (referring to the People's Liberation Army) attack stubbornly, which is worrying. The company commander wrote words (referring to a will) in my manual, which is quite sad... I also wrote words in the manual of the special service chief, in case the heavens have no eyes, please notify my family." The diary on the 21st was even more disheartening: "The wounded are carried down one by one, the situation is very tragic. I can only pray to God to bless me. I don't know if my family knows my current situation? ... It's better to die, what do I care about my wife and children?" This is actually the general feeling of the enemy army, but the result is definitely not as bad as Liu Yongchang imagined. Chiang Kai-shek insisted on driving thousands of people to be buried with that declining class, but the People's Liberation Army pulled them out of the grave and gave them a new life. When the battle ended, groups of prisoners were sent to the rear, and they stepped onto the boundless great plain, this vast free land of liberated people, rejoicing in their new life after laying down their weapons.

    蒋匪第三军的覆灭
    【新华社晋察冀三十日电】本社记者杨朔报导清风店蒋匪第三军的覆灭称：这次蒋匪第三军第七师及十六军一个团的覆灭，又是内战头子蒋介石另一次给人民解放军送礼。蒋匪震慑于平汉北段人民解放军的强大攻势，慌慌张张连下数道命令，驱使第三军从石家庄日夜兼程，冒险赶往保定增援，于是罗历戎和杨光钰就浩浩荡荡把一万数千人赶入解放军替他们准备好了的坟地——清风店正东十三里的西南合等五个村。
    在蒋匪已知第三军的命运不妙之后，还想作一番垂死挣扎，蒋机整天盘旋在阵地上空扫射轰炸，入夜被围的村庄一齐点起柴草，天空仍旧隆隆地响着飞机，照明弹不断投下来，但这无非给这个葬礼点缀一些热闹，在人民解放军急风暴雨般的袭击下，敌人的军心已慌乱到极点。匪三十团的一个叫刘永昌的连政指早在日记本里写着：“匪（指人民解放军）攻击顽强，令人担忧，连长在我的手册上写了字（指遗书）颇觉凄然……，余在特务长之手册上也写了字，万一皇天无眼，请你通知我家。”二十一号的日记就更丧气：“伤兵一个个抬下来，情形甚惨，余心唯有祝祷苍天佑我而已，不知家人知我目前情形否？……还是死了好，妻与儿女管他干甚？”这其实是敌军的普遍心情，不过结果绝不如刘永昌所想象那样坏，蒋介石硬要驱使千万人替那个没落的阶级殉葬，解放军却把他们从坟墓边拉出来超度重生了。当战斗结束，一群一群的俘虏被送到后方，他们踏上漠漠无边的大平原，这片广大翻身人民的自由土地，欣幸着自己放下武器后的新生。
