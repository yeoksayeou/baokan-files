　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: The defeats of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops on all battlefields can no longer be concealed. An Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 24th, discussing the Shandong battlefield, which Chiang Kai-shek's clique has been loudly touting, pointed out: "The fruits of the 'victory' of the Kuomintang (referring to Chiang Kai-shek's bandits) autumn campaign in Shandong Province are rapidly disappearing under the repeated strikes of the Communist troops (referring to the People's Liberation Army). The Communist troops are seeping back into the areas they withdrew from sixty days ago. The situation in the past few weeks shows that the Communists now hold as much territory as before." An Agence France-Presse reporter, reporting on the situation of the Chinese Civil War from Beiping on October 23rd, emphasized the following facts: since late summer, the People's Liberation Army has victoriously brought the War of Liberation to the Chiang-occupied provinces of Hubei and Anhui north of the Yangtze River, "which means that there is war not only in the north, but also in central China. The war zone stretches over a thousand miles, from Changchun, Jilin in the north to Anqing in the south, and from Yan'an in the west to the Shandong Peninsula in the east, covering vast areas north and south of the Yellow River." Although Chiang Kai-shek's clique has secretly ordered its propaganda organs to implement a so-called "scorched earth policy in propaganda" regarding the War of Liberation in the provinces north of the Yangtze River, which directly threatens the heart of Chiang Kai-shek's rule, its panic and helplessness can no longer be concealed. According to a United Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 25th, Liu Fei, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit Deputy Minister of National Defense, declared at the Kuomintang Memorial Week that the strength of the Communist army (referring to the People's Liberation Army) south of the Yellow River has developed to a "threatening degree." On the same day, the agency's reporter reported from Nanjing that bandit chieftains Chiang Kai-shek and Liu Fei both publicly announced that the military focus in the coming months would shift to dealing with the People's Liberation Army between the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers. Following the military conference of the six provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi held by Chiang Kai-shek's clique earlier this month, Bai Chongxi, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit Minister of National Defense, traveled to Jiujiang by ship on the 24th. According to United Press, he will be responsible for commanding the so-called "six-province joint defense operation," with his headquarters set up in Jiujiang. Chiang Kai-shek's bandit Executive Yuan President Zhang Qun will also go to the above-mentioned provinces for "inspection" in order to make his administrative measures cooperate with the operation. However, one of Chiang Kai-shek's clique's fatal weaknesses, namely insufficient military strength, has become impossible to overcome. For example, the so-called "six-province joint defense operation" can only focus on the so-called "training of the people to cooperate with the regular army."

　　Xinhua News Agency, East China, 26th: In the battle to recover the city of Yixian in southern Shandong this month, our army captured a secret document entitled "Essentials of Pacification News Work," personally drafted by Deng Wenyi, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's Director of the News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense. The full text is 20,000 words long. The secret document is extremely worried about the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's army's combat failures and declining morale over the past year. In the second and fourth sections of its "Political Work Review" section, it admits that "the relationship between officers and soldiers in the company is not good, the relationship between the military and the people is not good, the soldiers are uneasy in the company, always thinking of deserting, regarding being a soldier as painful, and viewing the barracks as a prison." It also states: "Today, most soldiers feel that they are forced to be soldiers and are bought and sold. There are many recruits in various units, but little training. They do not know the methods of 'suppressing bandits,' their combat skills are not proficient, so they are afraid of death and try to escape, and the mentality of being captured and surrendering is very common."

　　兵力不足惊惶失措
  　蒋匪狂呼防御华中
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】蒋介石匪军在所有各战场的败北，已无人能为之掩饰。美联社南京二十四日电在论及蒋匪所大吹特吹的山东战场时指出：“山东省政府军（指蒋匪）秋季战役的‘胜利’果实，在共产党军（按指人民解放军）一再撞击下，迅速地消失着。共产党军正在渗回六十天前他们撤出的地区，过去数周来的局势显示，共产党现握有如同从前一样多的地区。”法新社记者十月二十三日自北平报导中国内战局势时，强调指出如下事实，即自夏末以来，人民解放军已胜利地将解放战争带到了长江以北湖北、安徽等蒋占省份，“这就是说，不仅北方，而且华中也有了战争。作战区北自吉林长春，南至安庆一线，西自延安，东达山东半岛，蔓延千余哩，遍布大河南北广大地区。”而直捣蒋匪统治心脏的长江以北各省的解放战争，蒋匪虽密令其宣传机关实行所谓“宣传上的坚壁清野”，但其惊惶失措业已不能掩饰。据合众社上海二十五日电，蒋匪国防部次长刘斐在国民党纪念周上宣称，黄河以南共军（按指解放军）的力量已发展到“具有威胁性的程度”；同日该社记者自南京报导，匪首蒋介石和刘斐均公开宣布，此后数月之军事重心，将转为对付长江黄河间的人民解放军。继本月初蒋匪召开江苏、安徽、河南、湖北、湖南、江西六省军事会议之后，蒋匪国防部长白崇禧已于二十四日乘舰赴九江。据合众社称：彼将负责指挥所谓“六省联防作战”，其指挥部即设在九江；蒋匪行政院长张群亦将赴上述各省“巡视”，以便使其行政措施配合作战。但蒋匪致命弱点之一，即军力不足，已显无法克服，如所谓“六省联防作战”，也只能着重于所谓“训练民国以配合正规军作战”。
    【新华社华东二十六日电】本月十八日鲁南我军于光复峄县城之役，缴获蒋匪国防部新闻局长邓文仪亲手制订之“绥靖新闻工作要领”密件一册，全文长两万字，该密件对于蒋匪军一年来作战失败、士气颓丧，极为忧惧。在其“政治工作检讨”一节第二项及第四节中承认连队中“官兵关系不佳，军民关系不好，士兵不安于连，时思离队逃跑，认当兵为痛苦，视军营为牢狱。”并称：“今日多数士兵心里都觉得被迫而当兵，系由买卖而来，各部队新兵甚多，训练甚少，不知道‘剿匪’方法，战斗技术没有熟练，因之怕死图逃，作战无勇，被俘屈服之心理甚为普遍。”
