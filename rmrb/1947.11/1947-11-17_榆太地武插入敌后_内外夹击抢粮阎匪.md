The Yu Tai Regional Armed Forces Penetrate Enemy Rear, Launching Internal and External Attacks to Seize Grain from the Yan Bandits

[This newspaper, Taihang, 15th dispatch] In order to crush the Yan bandit's large-scale "water immersion" grain grabbing in our Yu Tai area, our local armed forces and the broad masses of militia are launching internal and external attacks against the invading enemy. On the evening of the 9th of this month, our army penetrated the enemy's rear and first cut off the Tongpu Railway between Yuci and Qixian. And with infantry combined with engineers, we destroyed two holes of the Wuma River Railway Bridge north of Taigu City. After the enemy discovered it, they attacked with a platoon of troops, but were repelled by us. Another part of our troops attacked the railway section from Dongguan Town (belonging to Qixian) south of Taigu to Qixian, intercepting four rails and more than one hundred kilograms of wires. On the same day, our Yuci Independent Battalion ambushed near Dongyang Station, twenty miles south of Yuci City. The enemy did not dare to go out for a step. After destroying a section of the railway, we returned victoriously. Through our separate active attacks, we have severely threatened the flanks of the invading enemy. The troops, militia and masses who persisted in fighting on the inner lines, due to the development of autumn harvest and land distribution, and the increased class consciousness, were strong in fighting spirit under the pressure of the enemy's superior forces, and launched extensive guerrilla warfare and explosive movements against the enemy, achieving repeated victories from the 20th to the 30th of last month. On the 30th of last month, more than one hundred and twenty Yan bandits from the third battalion of the ninth column of the Taigu Tuzhuang came to Baiyan and Tucun to grab grain. After our × unit learned about it, they set up an ambush between the two villages. When the enemy entered the ambush circle, we suddenly launched a charge, killing 12 bandits including the battalion commander, and wounding more than 20. The enemy fled in a panic. We captured one light machine gun, twelve rifles, more than two hundred bullets, and seven bayonets. We only suffered two minor injuries. On the same day, our Yuci Independent Battalion learned that more than 60 Yan puppet military police from the Xishuang Village police brigade had invaded Yangliang to grab grain. The battalion immediately ran to the village and sent a squad to search ahead. When they approached the village, they suddenly encountered an enemy sentry who asked: "Which unit are you from?" We wittily replied: "Road protection team!" While speaking, we moved forward and suddenly captured four bandits alive. Then we rushed into the village and killed or wounded nine more enemies. The bandits fled in all directions. We captured four guns and more than three hundred bullets. In the enemy's rear villages in the four districts of Taigu Pingchuan and the front-line villages in the three districts of the mountainous area, a total of 180 landmines were buried during the enemy's water immersion invasion, 56 of which exploded, killing or wounding 67 enemies. In the battle, our armed forces behind the enemy lines used rifles to kill eight enemies, captured thirteen alive (including seven landlords), and captured two machine guns, twelve rifles, and other things. On the first day of the enemy's invasion, nine mines were detonated in Donglu Village, District 7, killing or wounding more than ten enemies. One family also hung a landmine in a cabinet. When the enemy opened the cabinet, three were killed and three were wounded, greatly reducing the enemy's looting. Now our soldiers and civilians are continuing their efforts to completely crush the enemy's "water immersion" grain grabbing.
