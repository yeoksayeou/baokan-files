    [This Dispatch from Taiyue, 22nd] The Jinan branch of the Taiyue Xinhua Bookstore, in order to deliver cultural nourishment to front-line soldiers and those participating in the war, has created a mobile bookstore on the battlefield. The store's manager and deputy manager, Zhang Shitu and Qin Liangwu, each led a mobile bookstore, going deep into the front lines surrounding Yuncheng to supply cultural nourishment. When the soldiers in the trenches saw them, they all said, "We never expected you to come here!" Comrade Li Dejun, deputy political commissar of a certain brigade, shook their hands with emotion, expressing a warm welcome. The mobile bookstore on the battlefield set up shop in the trenches and command posts. Small books such as "Stories of Mao Zedong," "A Record of General Liu Bocheng," and "Eliminate Two Hundred and Fifty Enemies" were the most popular among the soldiers and sold the most copies.
