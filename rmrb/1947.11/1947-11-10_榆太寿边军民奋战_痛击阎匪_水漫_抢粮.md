(Our newspaper's Taihang telegram of the 3rd) After the military and civilians on the borders of Taigu, Shouyang, and Yuci victoriously completed the autumn protection battle in mid-last month, they have achieved successive victories in combating the enemy's key grain robbery. After the failure of the Yan bandits' autumn harvest robbery, they scraped together troops again, concentrating their forces, and transferred two regiments of the Eighth Column from Shouyang to Yuci. The enemy in Taigu also advanced and occupied our Fancun, attempting to carry out "waterlogging" style grain robbery in our border areas, vainly hoping to "eat ready-made meals." However, they were intercepted and annihilated by our military and civilians everywhere, inflicting serious blows on the enemy. Under the slogans of "Actively Annihilate the Enemy" and "Protect the Fields and Protect the Grain," the Taigu Independent Regiment created a model of five battles and five victories. On the 12th and 14th of last month, the regiment crushed the Yan bandit "settlement teams," the Ninth Column, and the security police brigade from Houcheng, Guanjia Fort, and Beixi Village. On three occasions in two days (twice on the 14th), a total of more than 250 people attempted to rob grain from our Dongxianyang and Beizhang Village, killing, wounding, and capturing a total of 18 enemies, seizing one machine gun and one small cannon. On the 21st of the same month, more than 400 Yan bandits from Fancun went to our Yudao Gou Village to rob grain and attempted to reach Shigenao to cover the enemy in Dongxi Quhe's attack on Baoguo Village. As soon as they entered Yudao Gou, our Independent Regiment launched a blocking battle with them, persisting in the battle for two days and two nights, killing and wounding a total of 15 enemies. Comrade Li Wanyuan, a special-class hero in killing the enemy, hit two enemies with three shots. Tian Lanming of the first squad and Cheng Jiazi, a health worker of the second squad, each killed an enemy with one shot, winning the praise of all the soldiers, making the enemy dare not move forward a single step. On the 24th, all of the 212th Regiment of the 71st Division and most of the 3rd Regiment of the 9th Column of the Yan bandits, a total of more than 1,800 people, departed from Dadao Liang and Xiaxi, attempting to occupy the mountain east of Shiluomen, covering the enemy robbing grain in Pangzhuang and Wu Ke. When they advanced into the ditch at the foot of Shiluomen Mountain, they were attacked by hand grenades by the Independent Regiment soldiers ambushed on the mountain, killing and wounding 31 of them. In addition, one of our soldiers disregarded sacrifice, rushed into the hillside and seized a "Type 38" rifle and more than 50 rounds of ammunition. They covered the safe transfer of the masses in several villages near Dadao Liang, breaking the enemy's grain robbery plan. The next day, the enemy retreated to the city with their heads drooping. The Yan bandit "rolling teams" and "returning home corps" in Shouyang have been repeatedly defeated by our militiamen in the autumn harvest, but they are still unwilling to give up. On the 23rd of last month, in retaliation for our militiamen, they transferred about a thousand regular troops from various places, carrying more than ten light and heavy machine guns and more than ten small cannons, and attacked our Feicun area in three routes to rob grain. They were often met with counterattacks by our militiamen, and after about four hours of fierce fighting, the Yan bandits suffered more than 40 casualties. Seeing the fierce situation, the enemy retreated in a panic. We only sacrificed one person, creating an unprecedented example of one-to-forty. A part of the Ninth Column of the Yan bandits in Yuci, combined with more than 500 fleeing landlords, went to Dongxi Changning in the first district of the county on the 16th of last month to rob grain. Our Fourth District Armed Work Team and the Second District Land Redistribution and Autumn Protection Assault Team, combined with the militiamen of four nearby villages, encircled and annihilated the enemy from the front and sides. The enemy was unable to hold out and fled in a panic. Our militiamen pursued them to Lianbi Village and fought a battle, killing, wounding, and capturing a total of six Yan bandits and landlords, seizing two carts, two mules, one bayonet, and recovering one cow and one donkey, and fifteen sacks. Another group of a small number of Yan bandits covered more than 200 fleeing landlords to rob grain in the Donggou area in the north. They were disrupted by our Ji Ma militia and captured 16 landlords alive. On the night of the 17th of last month, our Yutaiqi Road West Armed Work Team ambushed in Yaocun Village in the second district, one and a half li away from the enemy's important village stronghold and five li away from the Wangdu stronghold, preparing to meet the enemy's grain robbery troops. At 11:40 a.m. the next morning, more than ten Yan bandit "district teams" stationed in Dongyang came to our ambush site (Yaocun). When the enemy walked to about 30 steps away from our ambush site, the armed work team launched a hand grenade assault battle against the enemy, hitting the enemy's heads and brains, and they fled for their lives. The battle ended in about five minutes, killing five enemies and capturing four alive, with no casualties on our side, seizing one machine gun, nine rifles, more than 200 rounds of ammunition, and ten hand grenades. After this battle, the enemy in Yao Village became even more panicked and shrank all the sentries on the pillbox back inside the blockhouse, preparing to be beaten. At present, our second sub-district border grain protection war is becoming increasingly fierce. The focus of the sharp struggle between the enemy and us has been concentrated on the Yutai Shou border. In recent weeks, the Yan bandits have mobilized about two divisions of the 71st Division, the Eighth and Ninth Columns, and local puppet bandit armed forces, attempting to rob grain on a large scale on our western front. Our border military and civilians are launching counterattacks against the enemy everywhere.

    【本报太行三日电】太谷、寿阳、榆次我边地军民，于上月中旬胜利完成保秋战斗任务后，在打击敌重点抢粮中，又迭获胜利。阎匪于秋季抢收失败后，遂又七凑八拼，集中兵力，由寿阳调来榆次八纵队两个团，太谷敌亦进占我范村，企图向我边地进行“水漫”式的抢粮，妄想“吃现成”。但遭到我军民到处截击和歼灭，给敌以严重打击。太谷独立团在“主动歼敌”与“保田保粮”的口号下，创五战五捷的范例，上月十二、十四两日，该团粉碎侯城、贯家堡、北洗村之阎匪“倒算队”、九纵队、保警大队等，两日三次（十四日两次）共二百五十余人，向我东咸阳、北张村抢粮，共毙伤俘敌十八名，缴机枪一挺，小炮一门，同月二十一日范村阎匪四百余人，到我峪道沟村抢粮，并企图到达石圪垴，掩护东西曲河之敌进攻堡郭村，刚进至峪道沟时，我独立团即与其展开阻击战，坚持两日两夜的战斗，共毙伤敌十五名，特等杀敌功臣李万元同志三枪中二敌，一区队田蓝明和二区队卫生员程甲子均一枪一敌，博得全体战士的赞扬，使敌未敢前进一步。二十四日范村阎匪七十一师二一二团全部，九纵队三团大部共一千八百余人，出发大道梁、下西，企图占领石罗门正东山头，掩护庞庄、五棵抢粮之敌，进至石罗门山下沟内，被我预伏于该山头的独立团战士，用手榴弹即炸死炸伤三十一名；另我一战士不顾牺牲，冲入半山坡缴“三八式”步枪一枝，子弹五十余发。掩护了大道梁附近数村群众安全转移，打破了敌人抢粮计划，次日敌垂头丧气败退城内。寿阳阎匪“滚滚队”、“还乡团”，在我边地抢秋中，屡经我民兵击败，仍不死心，于上月二十三日，为报复我民兵，从各地抽调正规军一个团约千余人，带轻重机枪十余挺，小炮十余门，分三路向我肥村一带进攻抢粮，常遭我民兵再起迎击，激战约四个钟头，阎匪死伤四十余，敌见势凶勇，狼狈退回，我仅牺牲一人，创一比四十的空前战例。榆次阎匪九纵队一部结合逃亡地主共五百余人，在上月十六日到该县一区东西长凝抢粮，我四区武工队及二区分田保秋突击队结合附近四村民兵，从正侧围歼敌人，敌不支仓惶逃窜，我民兵尾追至连壁村打了一仗，计毙伤俘阎匪及地主共六名，缴大车两辆，骡子两头，刺刀一把，夺回牛驴各一，口袋十五条。另一股少数阎匪掩护逃亡地主二百余人，到北起东沟一带抢粮，被我季马民兵打乱，活捉地主十六名。上月十七日夜我榆太祁路西武工队，埋伏于距敌要村据点一里半与王都据点五里之二区遥村村内，准备迎击敌抢粮部队，到次日上午十一时四十分时，有驻扎东阳之阎匪“区分队”十余人，向我伏地（遥村）走来，当敌走到距我伏地三十步左右时，该武工队即向敌展开手榴弹冲杀战，打的敌人昏头昏脑，各自逃生，约五分钟时间，战斗即告结束，共毙敌五名，活捉四名，我无伤亡；缴机枪一挺，步马枪九枝，子弹二百余发，手榴弹十颗。经此一战，要村之敌，益加恐慌，把炮台上的一个班哨，亦全部缩回炮楼以内，准备挨打。目前我二分区边地护粮战正日趋白热化，敌我尖锐的斗争焦点已集中到榆、太、寿边地，近旬以来，阎匪调集七十一师、八、九纵队及地方伪匪武装约两师之众，企图在我西线大肆抢粮，我边地军民正到处向敌展开反击。
