    Gucheng Party Members Take the Lead:
    Over Three Thousand People Set Out
    [This dispatch from our Jinnan office, dated the 6th] Village cadres and Party members in Gucheng County took the lead, and over three thousand eight hundred liberated peasants set out to support the front lines. At a mass meeting in Niwo Village, Second District, a village cadre explained: "This mission of carrying stretchers is a glorious task for us liberated peasants. Landlords, rich peasants, and households under surveillance are resolutely not wanted." Before he finished speaking, Han Shunchang, the director of the Farmers' Association, and Han Wenchang, a member of the Poor Peasants' Association, were the first to sign up. They said: "Under the leadership of the Communist Party, I have been liberated. To defeat Chiang Kai-shek and live a good life, I will not return home until the task is completed." The liberated peasants signed up one after another, and the masses applauded. Sun Guotao from Dongxin Village, upon hearing that stretchers were needed, voluntarily connected with twelve liberated peasants to sign up. At a meeting of women farmers from nine villages convened by Tian Xiaoma, Cui Lianzhu, the militia captain of Cai Xiaoma, was the first to sign up, saying: "I am a Communist Party member, and I should take the lead. I will do the difficult things first. Not only will I not run back, but I can also guarantee that those who are with me will not desert." The ensuing registrations were enthusiastically supportive. Li Ya'e, Wang Hongcai, and Wang Hongfa performed meritorious service during the last stretcher-bearing mission, and they signed up for a second time, striving to add to their merits. Under the enthusiastic support of the liberated peasants throughout the county, three thousand eight hundred and twelve liberated peasants (including five hundred Party members), led by Minister Liang of the County Committee, headed straight for the front lines.

    故城党员带头
    三千余人出征
    【本报冀南六日电】故城县村干党员带头，三千八百余名翻身农民出征，支援前线。二区牛卧庄村干在群众会上说明了：“这次出担架是我们翻身农民的光荣任务，地主富农被斗户坚决不要。”话未说完，农会主任韩顺昌、贫民会委员韩文昌首起报名。他们说：“在共党领导下我翻了身。为打败蒋介石，过好日子，不完成任务不回家。”翻身农民相继报名，群众鼓掌欢迎。东辛庄孙国涛听说要担架，自动串连了十二个翻身农民报名前去。田小麻召开的九个村的农妇会员大会上，蔡小麻民兵队长崔连助抢先报名说：“我是共产党员，该我带头先去，困难事我干到头里。不但我不往回跑，还敢保证和我在一块的也不开小差。”接连报名的拥护一团。李鸭鹅、王洪才、王洪法上次出担架中立了功，这次他们二次报名，争取功上加功。全县在翻身农民热烈支援前线的高度热情下，三千八百十二名翻身农民（内有五百党员）在县委会梁部长带头下，直奔前线。
