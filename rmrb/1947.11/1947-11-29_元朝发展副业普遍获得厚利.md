(This report from our Jinnan office dated the 27th) Yuan Dynasty's sideline production is widely developed, generating huge profits. Yao Guang Village in the Second District was the poorest village two years ago with very little land. However, they are skilled at making tile basins, earning a lot of money. Previously, this was controlled by landlords who stipulated that they were not allowed to burn tiles in April, May, June, or July, fearing that if the poor earned too much money, it would affect their willingness to farm for him. Since the spring of this year, after mobilizing production, exposing the landlords' conspiracy, and clearing the minds of village cadres, Zhang Gengfang, the chairman of the peasant representatives, organized 156 middle and poor peasants, with a total of 39 kilns (including eight newly built ones). Each kiln had four people, divided into 39 groups, combining agriculture and working day and night. From January to the end of September, they fired a total of 164 kilns, each kiln earning a profit of 140,000 yuan, totaling 22.96 million yuan, an income equal to agriculture. In Nanba Village in the Fifth District, 38 flour mills worked day and night, producing 95 portions of flour every day. Seventy-eight transport carts were constantly on the move. All able-bodied and semi-able-bodied men in the village were busy. Zhao Changgeng's flour milling team, with seven laborers, plus women and children, milled 21 portions of flour in ten days, earning 97,000 yuan. Guo Hongde, the director of the Nonghui (Farmers' Association) in Nanxiaozhong in the First District, together with Guo Hongxiang, Guo Hongzhang, and Guo Yonglin, organized a tofu-making mutual aid team. In thirteen days, they ground a total of 30 small dou (斗, a unit of dry volume measure) of soybeans, making 690 jin (斤, a unit of weight, approximately 0.5 kg) of tofu. Each jin could be sold for 160 yuan, totaling a net profit of 33,000 yuan in thirteen days. Each person also received 221 jin of soybean residue, equivalent to 66.5 jin of millet. In Tiebuying in the Fourth District, there were fifteen or sixteen people who knew how to weave wicker products, but usually only four or five people did it regularly. This year, with the development of the production movement, in addition to all the old weaving families starting to work, 21 more people joined in. They weave one dun (囤, a container for grain storage) a day, costing 1,000 yuan and earning 2,000 yuan. The whole village earned more than 68,000 yuan a day. In Xiquanzhuang in the Fourth District, out of a total of 135 households in the village, 71 households (95 people) have started sideline activities, voluntarily forming eight mutual aid teams. In Houliguai, out of 30 households, 28 have joined sideline groups, organizing a charcoal burning team, earning more than 300,000 yuan in two months. In Qianliguai, out of 105 households, 53 households with 55 people have joined sideline occupations. At the district meeting, the masses of the village challenged Chendaoxian Village, stating that this winter, more than 85 percent of the village should participate in sideline occupations, and 75 percent of the women should participate in weaving.
