　　【This Newspaper Wu'an News】More than eight thousand district and village cadres and activists gathered successively. After studying the current affairs, everyone clearly understood the current situation of the great counter-offensive and the importance of expanding the class armed forces. Under the slogan of "Fight to Nanjing, Dig out Old Jiang's Roots," they enthusiastically launched the movement to join the counter-offensive army. More than seven hundred people registered at the meeting, of which two-thirds were party members. After the meeting, through the deliberation and discussion of the masses in various villages, an unprecedented upsurge of joining the army was set off. In just five days, more than four thousand people registered to join the army, exceeding half of the task, and the quality was better than any previous time. In Chengguan District, 387 people registered in three days. After review by the district and village, 248 people were approved to enlist, including 82 party members and cadres. Among the 101 leading cadres in the Ninth District, more than 60 were party members. Hu Xianjing in the First District, seeing people sending their husbands and sons to join the army, thought that she was an activist who had been a maid in the past but was now emancipated. After several mobilizations, she finally persuaded her husband to register. Han Yurong from Fifth Street, after returning from a meeting in the district, cleared her mother-in-law's mind and went to Yong Maochang in Third Street overnight to mobilize her husband, and asked her husband's friends Yang San's and Zhang Xiu to help her mobilize. They succeeded that night and also mobilized his brother to register. Meng Xiangshun, a double anti-family member from Tonghui Village in the Third District, sent two sons to join the army last year, and this time he sent his third son to the counter-offensive army. Yang Dongtang, the director of the farmers' association in Mopanjun, Seventh District, three brothers in the family competed to register at the family meeting. Because of the argument over joining the army, none of them would give in. After discussion at the family meeting, Yang Dongtang continued to work in the village, while Tiantang and Yutang went to the front to capture Old Jiang. In the celebration of the victory of the counter-offensive in various places, the new soldiers and the masses made mutual guarantees. Zhang Liang, a new soldier from Fifth Street in Chengguan, gave a speech with快板(a kind of folk rhythmic narrative): "Voluntarily register to join the army, no one needs to till the land at home, I will work hard at the front, guarantee to kill the enemy and make great contributions, if you don't believe me, look later, you will see my name in the People's Daily." The masses also made guarantees for the work of supporting the army, and the slogan they raised to each other was: "The stones show when the water recedes, see people's hearts after the event!" At present, the masses are conducting a review and re-examination of the new soldiers.
