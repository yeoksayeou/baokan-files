　　Su, Lu, Yu, and Anhui Forces Sever Enemy East-West Transportation Artery
  　Shaanxi Southern Troops Penetrate Deep into Chiang Bandit's Heartland
    The Yu, E, and Shaanxi Liberation Army continues to develop its offensive, penetrating deep into the southwestern Henan and southern Shaanxi heartland. On the eastern front, our forces captured An'gao Town, an important stronghold of the Chiang bandits northwest of Nanyang, on the 15th; Zhenping on the 17th; Biyang west of the Pinghan Railway on the 19th; and Tanghe southeast of Nanyang on the 20th. By this point, vast areas of southwestern Henan had been liberated, and Nanyang was under siege on three sides. On the western front, our forces captured Shanyang in southern Shaanxi on the 11th, and continued west to capture Zhen'an, 200 li south of Xi'an, on the 17th, and the strategic county town of Lushi on the same day. In the southwestern Henan and southern Shaanxi heartland, Chiang bandit forces are weak, and morale is extremely low. Wherever our troops arrive, the Chiang bandits either flee or are captured.
    The Su, Lu, Yu, and Anhui Liberation Army continued to capture Peixian, northwest of Xuzhou, on the evening of the 18th, and Yutai in southwestern Shandong on the 19th, completely annihilating the 700-plus defending enemy troops. In the afternoon, two battalions of the remnants of the enemy's 70th Division in Jinxiang and a part of the security regiment came to reinforce, but were also completely annihilated, with over 600 captured. In this major Longhai Railway destruction campaign, our forces captured nine cities within ten days, including Dangshan, Yucheng, Xiayi, Minquan, Xiaoxian, Juye, Jiaxiang, Peixian, and Yutai; thirteen stations between Xu (zhou) and Lan (feng) on the Longhai Railway; and four stations south of Xuzhou on the Jinpu Railway, wiping out over 11,000 enemies (excluding the Yutai battle). We thoroughly destroyed 380 li of the Longhai Railway and 30 li of the Jinpu Railway, completely severing the Chiang bandit's important east-west transportation artery, greatly exposing the Chiang bandit's strategic central city to the danger of being attacked by the Liberation Army at any time. This has forced the Chiang bandits, who are already stretched thin and in a passive position, to shoulder the heavy burden of defending strategic cities, creating more favorable conditions for the Liberation Army to annihilate the Chiang bandits in greater numbers.
    The Lunan Liberation Army in East China, in coordination with the Longhai Railway destruction campaign, launched an offensive northeast of Xuzhou, capturing Pixian and Zaozhuang on the 17th, and controlling over 100 li of the Lin (cheng) - Tai (erzhuang) branch railway, and captured Yixian on the 18th. By this point, the northeastern defense of Xuzhou, a strategic location for the Chiang bandits, and the eastern section of the Longhai Railway had also been severely threatened by our forces. On the Jiaoji Railway, the Liberation Army captured Jiaoxian on the 21st. Currently, from Fangzi, west of Weixian, to Guhe, east of Jiaoxian, over 200 li of railway, except for the isolated city of Gaomi, is once again entirely under our control. Our forces persisted in Weihaiwei City for 36 days, wiping out over a thousand enemies, gloriously completing the mission, and proactively transferred on the 17th. Our Bohai forces once attacked Shouguang on the 14th, capturing over 400 enemies.
    Local armed forces and militia guerrilla warfare in various parts of East China are becoming increasingly active, with remarkable achievements, recovering vast areas and forcing the Chiang bandits to be confined to isolated points and lines. The Luzhong District wiped out Chiang bandit forces on the Xin (tai) - Wen (kou) road from the 1st to the 14th, totaling over 1,300 enemies. Another unit of our local armed forces cleared the Chiang-puppet forces in Zichuan and Yidu south of the Jiaoji Railway last month and once attacked Yidu. In the Binhai District, over the past month, we have successively captured more than ten strongholds east of Linyi, including Xiakou and Dongsha, and recovered more than 400 villages and towns, wiping out over 1,300 enemies, creating a new record of 125 to 1 enemy-to-ours casualty ratio. The enemy in Penglai and Weixian in Jiaodong District has been compressed by our forces into points and lines. On the 8th, 600 enemies from Penglai went out of the city to plunder grain and 300 were annihilated. In the Tonghai area of ​​northern Jiangsu, we captured Liuqiao Town north of Nantong on the 9th, directly threatening Nantong.
    Jinji Luyu: On the 21st, the Jinnan Liberation Army completely defeated more than 10,000 Chiang bandit troops from the First Brigade and Twenty-eighth Brigade who crossed the river from Pinglu to aid Yuncheng, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 3,700 enemies below the regimental commander level. In the past month, our siege troops have cleared seven outer fortress groups and wiped out a total of over 2,000 defending enemy troops. On the northern front, we are intensifying the siege of the isolated city of Yuanshi south of Shijiazhuang. The Yan bandit's large-scale grain plundering invasion of the Yuci-Taigu liberated area has been fiercely repulsed by us and they are now scurrying back. The grain protection war in various border areas of the entire region is now being vigorously unfolded.
    Jinchaji: After the Liberation Army captured Shijiazhuang, the Chiang bandit forces in various places were extremely panic-stricken. Our local armed forces and militia are launching widespread attacks. From last month to the 15th of this month, they have wiped out more than 5,000 enemies, successively captured four cities including Xiongxian, Rongxian, Xinzhen, and Baxian (the cities of Xiong and Ba were re-occupied by the Chiang bandit forces), and dozens of important strongholds such as Songlin Store, and twice attacked Lixian and Pingdi, two important towns 60 li south of Pingnan, and once attacked the Wujiazui stronghold more than 10 li north of Tianjin, completely destroying the section of the Pinghan Railway from Zhuoxian to Gaobeidian, cutting off the Pingbao transportation, making the Chiang bandit forces in Pingjinbao extremely shocked. Currently, our guerrilla warfare is fiercely unfolding in the Pingjinbao triangle area. At the same time, in the northern Chahar region, our light cavalry forces captured Habaga, an important town for Mongolian-Han trade, and established a grassland guerrilla base with more than 10,000 people in more than 100 villages and towns. The local masses have now begun to implement land reform.
    After investigation, the battle in which the Northwest Liberation Army defeated Ma Hongkui's bandit troops reinforcing Yulin from the 13th to the 15th resulted in a total of over 4,200 enemies annihilated and 9 regimental and deputy regimental commanders and battalion commanders captured alive.
    In the Northeast, our local corps fought three battles in Kangping from the 10th to the 17th, continuously defeating parts of the 169th Division of the Chiang bandit's New Sixth Army that had invaded the city three times, ensuring the city's security, killing over a hundred enemy troops below the regimental commander level, and capturing over three hundred.
    In total, the county towns captured by the Liberation Army this week that have been announced are Zhenping, Biyang, Tanghe, Shanyang, Zhen'an, Lushi, Peixian, Yutai, Pixian, Yixian, Jiaoxian, Kangping and twelve other major towns and cities such as Zaozhuang and Yimenji.

    苏鲁豫皖解放军于十八日晚续克徐州西北之沛县，十九日克鲁西南鱼台、全歼鱼台守敌七百余，是日下午，金乡敌七十师残部两个营及保安团一部出援，亦遭全歼，俘六百余。此次陇海大破击战役，我十天内共克砀山、虞城、夏邑、民权、萧县、巨野、嘉祥、沛县、鱼台等九城，陇海路徐（州）兰（封）间车站十三处，津浦路徐州以南车站四处，歼敌一万一千余，（鱼台之役未统计在内）澈底破毁陇海路三百八十里，津浦路三十里，完全斩断蒋匪重要东西交通动脉，大大暴露了蒋匪战略中心城市，随时有被解放军攻击的危险，因而迫使蒋匪业已拮据，并已处于被动的机动兵力更加背上防守战略城市的重大包袱，造成解放军更加大量歼灭蒋匪的优越条件。
    华东鲁南解放军配合陇海路破击战，在徐州东北发动攻势，于十七日克邳县与枣庄，控制临（城）台（儿庄）支线铁路百余里，十八日攻克峄县。至此，蒋匪战略要地徐州之东北防御及陇海路东段亦已遭受我严重威胁。胶济线上，解放军于二十一日克胶县；现西起维县东之坊子，东迄胶县东之沽河，二百余华里铁路，除高密孤城外，已全部再为我控制。威海卫市我军坚持三十六天，歼敌千余，光荣完成任务，于十七日主动转移；渤海我军十四日一度攻入寿光，俘敌四百余。
    华东各地地方武装与民兵游击战则益趋活跃，战绩卓著，收复广大地区，迫使蒋匪困守孤立点线。鲁中区于一日至十四日扫荡新（泰）汶（口）路蒋匪，共歼敌一千三百余。另部我地方武装于上月扫清胶济路南淄川、益都之蒋伪，并一度攻入益都。滨海区一月来连克临沂以东之夏口、东沙等十余据点，收复村镇四百余处，歼敌一千三百余，创造敌我伤亡一百二十五比一之新纪录。胶东区蓬莱、潍县之敌，被我压缩于点线。八日蓬莱敌六百出城抢粮，被歼三百。苏中通海地区，九日我克南通以北之刘桥镇，直逼南通。
    晋冀鲁豫：晋南解放军二十一日全部击溃自平陆渡河北援运城之蒋匪第一旅第二十八旅等万余人，毙伤俘敌团长以下三千七百余。一月来我围城部队即扫清敌外围七个堡垒群，并歼守敌共二千余人。北线方面我正加紧围困石家庄以南之元氏孤城。阎匪对榆次太谷解放区的大举抢粮进犯，遭我痛击后，已纷纷回窜。全区各边沿地区的护粮战现正猛烈展开。
    晋察冀：解放军攻克石家庄后，各地蒋匪极为惶恐，我地方武装及民兵均正普遍出击，自上月至本月十五日，已歼敌五千余名，先后攻克雄县、容县、新镇、霸县（雄、霸两城复为蒋匪侵占）等四城，及松林店等重要据点数十处，并二度袭入平南六十里之礼贤、平地两重镇，一度袭入津北十余里之吴家嘴据点，全部破除平汉线涿县至高碑店段铁路，断绝平保交通，使平津保三地蒋匪极为震恐，现我游击战争正在平津保三角地带炽烈展开。同时，察北方面，我轻骑部队攻克蒙汉贸易重镇哈巴嘎，建立百余村镇拥有万余人口的草原游击根据地，当地群众现已开始实行土地改革。
    西北解放军于十三日至十五日击溃增援榆林之马鸿逵匪部之战，经查明共歼敌四千二百余名，生俘正副团长及营长九名。
    东北我地方兵团自十日至十七日三战康平，连续击败三度侵入该城之蒋匪新六军一六九师一部，确保该城，毙敌团长以下百余，俘三百余。
    总计本周所发表解放军攻克之县城为镇平、泌阳、唐河、山阳、镇安、卢氏、沛县、鱼台、邳县、峄县、胶县、康平等十二座及枣庄、义门集等重镇。
