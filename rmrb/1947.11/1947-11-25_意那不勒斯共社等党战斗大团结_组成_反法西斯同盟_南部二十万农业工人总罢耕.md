Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: Reports from various sources: The anti-fascist movement sweeping across Italy continues to surge. In the city of Naples, the Communist Party, Socialist Party, Republican groups, and various people's democratic organizations have achieved militant solidarity and have taken the lead in forming a "Anti-Fascist Alliance to Defend the Republic and Democracy." The alliance demands that the government engage in an irreconcilable struggle against fascist forces and disband neo-fascist organizations such as the "National Social Movement Party." All tenant farmers in Apulia have gone on strike since the morning of November 16th to protest the arrest of the labor union secretary in the city of Luca. Workers in Tarucha (north of Rome) and Sardinia (a small island in western Italy) have also declared a general strike in protest against continuous provocations by fascists. In Milan, three fascist elements have been captured, who confessed that they were ordered to assassinate Communist Party worker Sangaventi on the 13th. The general strike of transportation workers in Rome has forced the authorities to release the arrested workers. Italian Communist Party leader Togliatti declared in a speech in Milan that anyone attempting to revive fascism in Italy would encounter resistance from the "organized strength of the workers." An editorial in the Italian Communist Party's newspaper "Unità" vehemently called out: "1921 should not be repeated!" It strongly criticized the Gasperi government for once again selling out Italy to fascists. It also emphasized: "Opposing the fascist bandits and self-defense are the primary responsibilities of the working people. The working people of Milan, Rome, Naples, and Palermo are fulfilling their responsibilities and serving the people of the whole country."
    
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: Reports from various sources: The anti-fascist movement in Italy continues to expand. 200,000 agricultural workers in the Puglia region of southern Italy have launched a general strike. According to a United Press report from Rome on the 19th, agricultural workers in Gravina in the region are using rifles, hoes, and all available weapons to defend themselves, resisting the violent suppression by the police. Under the self-defensive counterattack of the agricultural workers, the police were forced to retreat to the police station. Five thousand agricultural workers in Corato, near Bari, burned down the headquarters of the fascist "Common Man's Front" and attacked the city's police station. The reactionary Gasperi government has ordered the urgent deployment of mechanized units and police to the Puglia region in an attempt to suppress the farmers' resistance. Light tanks and armored vehicles filled with Italian army soldiers have arrived in Corato. Gasperi himself delivered a speech on the 17th, falsely accusing the Italian Communist Party leader's speech of being a "declaration of war," attempting to use it as a pretext for a bloody suppression of the anti-fascist movement. The left wing of the Socialist Party strongly criticized Gasperi's threatening speech and demanded the resignation of the current government.
