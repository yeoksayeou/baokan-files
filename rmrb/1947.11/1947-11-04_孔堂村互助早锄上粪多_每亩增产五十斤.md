    Kongtang Village's Mutual Aid in Early Weeding and Manure Application
    Leads to Increased Production of Fifty Jin Per Mu
    [Our newspaper's report from Southern Hebei, 2nd] In Yuanchao, Kongtang Village, thanks to mutual aid in early weeding and manure application, each mu produced more than fifty jin compared to last year, and the wheat fields expanded to seventy percent. At the "July 1st" celebration meeting with over two thousand people, the county called for an increase of ten jin of grain per mu. Kongtang Village's public security member Kong Xiangqing returned to the village and, together with village cadres and mutual aid team leaders, discussed responding to the higher-level call and organized the entire village to strive for an increase of fifteen jin per mu. At this time, the task of digging the Xin Zhuang River arrived. To prepare for planting, all the children, women, and elderly in the village were mobilized to participate in planting and delivering manure, and the seedlings were quickly planted. By July 13th, the seedlings had emerged and needed quick weeding. Kong Xiangqing and village cadres and mutual aid team leaders studied the development of mutual aid. After four mobilizations, many people participated in mutual aid. Weeding began on the 14th, and seven hundred and six mu of corn were completely weeded in a day and a half. Immediately afterward, manure accumulation was carried out. Village cadres organized inspections. Students and village cadres inspected manure pits door-to-door every day. If a household had a dry manure pit, village cadres would carry water to sprinkle on the manure, which caused a sensation throughout the village. During the autumn harvest, it was proposed that men and women go to the fields together to harvest early and plant wheat early. After research by village cadres and mutual aid team leaders, mutual aid was expanded to plant more wheat. The nineteen mutual aid teams expanded to twenty-four teams (some large teams freely became smaller teams again). A total of 105 households participated in mutual aid, with 103 male laborers, 51 semi-laborers, 37 female laborers, 68 female semi-laborers, 25 children, and 31 sisters, totaling 315 people and 72 livestock. Starting on August 14th, the autumn harvest was started, and 706 mu were harvested in eight days. The mung beans were all harvested by women, and the corn was all husked by children, sisters, the elderly, and the young. Last year, 584 mu of corn were planted, 590 carts of manure were applied, and 50,445 jin of corn were harvested. This year, 706 mu of corn were planted, 734 carts of manure were applied, and 89,610 jin of corn were harvested. This year, 122 and one-third mu were planted more than last year, and 39,165 jin were harvested more than last year, an increase of 55 jin per mu. Last year, 807 mu of wheat were planted, 518 carts of manure were applied, and 56,550 jin of wheat were harvested. This year, 1,239 mu of wheat were planted, 710 carts of manure were applied, and 11,500 jin of sesame, beans, and cottonseed cake were applied. 432 mu more wheat were planted than last year. The total land in the village is 1,752 mu. Last year, wheat planting accounted for only 43% of the cultivated land, and this year the wheat fields increased to 70%.
