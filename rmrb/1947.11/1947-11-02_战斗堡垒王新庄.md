Combat Fortress Wangxinzhuang

　　Wangxinzhuang is a village in the western part of the Third District of the Shijun District of Qibin County, sixteen miles west of the He (ze) Kao (cheng) highway. After the wheat harvest, the village chief Wang Dianwen, under my administrative order and the supervision of old activists, returned to the village and carried out land reform work in a perfunctory manner. At this time, a enemy informant reported to Lu Aiyu, the "Aimin Township" head of the puppet Third District. Lu summoned the village chief and gave him a severe reprimand, threatening, "If you don't return the land within three days, I'll take your head." The village chief asked the landlords for instructions, and the landlords Wang Guangju and Wang Dianxuan said, "You must firmly get it back for us!" As a result, the land contracts that the peasants had received were returned to the landlords. Later, when our armed work team arrived in the village, the masses reported to us, "The landlords in our village are counterattacking! We have to fight, or we won't be able to stand firm!" Based on the opinions of the masses, the government executed three bad enemy informants, Wang Jihe, Mai Jin, and He Laixi. At this time, the masses dared to raise their heads and said, "The enemy wants things without limit. If the poor want to stand up, they have to fight, we might as well risk it!" They stopped delivering burdens to the enemy. The masses demanded to organize home guards. After the activists mobilized the masses, they organized fifteen people. The militia activist Wang ×× dug out the rifle he got during the Dayang Lake battle last year. The old farmers' association chairman, who had been working with the district, also returned to the village with a gun and led the masses to guard their homes. The self-defense team patrolled at night, and the militia gathered to check the posts and fight, serving as a mobile force. At this time, the relatively stable areas had already undergone a review. The masses in the village proposed, "We made a mess of things in our village before. Let's do it again with more enthusiasm!" So, they first restored the farmers' association, women's association, and children's corps. Then, while the militia stood guard in the west of the village, they began to investigate and distribute floating wealth in the village. During the distribution of floating wealth, the scoundrel Wang Yulai tried to cause trouble and threatened the masses. The masses exposed on the spot that he had promised to help Lu Desheng, the platoon leader of the puppet Third Division, expand a squad, and had encouraged five people to join the enemy. Everyone proposed, "If we don't punish him, Wangxinzhuang will never have peace!" At the unanimous request of the masses, the district headquarters sentenced him to death. The masses felt that "The village has no more evil people, we can stand firm, let's work hard!" After the floating wealth was distributed, they proceeded to redistribute the land. The eighteen landlord and rich peasant families in the village returned two qing and fifty or sixty mu of land. As a result, the masses actively proposed to buy guns. They said, "How much does it cost to buy a gun? It's better than having the enemy drag away our cattle. When the enemy comes, we'll fight them!" The militia went to the district every day to ask for guns, and the district gave them a few more. The village stood firm. The people of Wangxinzhuang stood firm through struggle, but the enemy paid more attention to them and often tried to rob the village again. One day, more than forty members of the "plainclothes team" of the puppet Cao County Third District, carrying a crooked-necked machine gun, swaggered towards Wangxinzhuang. The four scouts at the front were about to reach the village when they were driven away by three militiamen. In the evening, a mass meeting was held, and everyone became more cautious in their guard duty. Each post had a small shed for protection even when it rained. Whenever it was Wang ××'s turn to stand guard, his nearly seventy-year-old father would check on him several times a night with a stick, repeatedly urging him, "Stand guard well, we won't survive if the enemy comes!" When they told him to go to sleep, he refused, saying, "I have more energy than you. More people mean more strength!" The village repelled four or five enemy attacks in a row. Several times, the enemy didn't dare to get close to the village and ran away. Since then, the enemy dared not come to this village again. Another time, the supplies for the puppet Third District First Platoon were approved to be delivered to the East Sanzhang Family, and the supplies for the Second Platoon were approved to be delivered to Wangxinzhuang. At dawn, the First Platoon took the grain. The Second Platoon asked the First Platoon to cooperate in urging the grain delivery to Wangxinzhuang. The First Platoon asked, "Who will be responsible for the losses?" The Second Platoon dared not go to Wangxinzhuang alone and returned halfway. Once, our Huaye field troops passed through the village. The militia shouted loudly, "Stop, which unit? One person come over here!" When the troops entered the village and saw that it was the militia, they praised them, "These militiamen are in charge, give them a good rifle." The villages located in the west of Wangxinzhuang, where the enemy often went, had most of their land in the west of the village. When the crops were ripe, the village automatically organized a large-scale mutual aid effort with the whole village's labor force. The militia held guns to protect the outer perimeter, the young and strong men carried grenades around their waists and harvested in the second line, and the old, weak, women, and children used the large grinding method around the village to harvest in a circle. All the crops in Wangxinzhuang were harvested and threshed. Wheat was planted, and the villagers were very satisfied. Since Wangxinzhuang organized the militia to guard their homes, the enemy had not entered the village once, had not robbed them of a single penny, and had not burdened them with a single grain of food. The masses all said, "If it weren't for these few guns, our village would have been ungovernable!" Under the influence of Wangxinzhuang's victory in armed struggle, the surrounding villages also armed themselves one after another. At the village cadre meeting of the entire district, it was said that the joint defense villages were very solid, and it was decided that the entire district would supply the joint defense team with provisions and ammunition. The relatively stable villages in the east said, "If the villages in the west stand firm, our cadres will be safe too." Thus, the armed home guards of Wangxinzhuang developed into an iron wall of anti-enemy joint defense for the entire district. (Ji Luyu Branch of the Xinhua News Agency)

    战斗堡垒王新庄
    王新庄是齐滨县石钧区三小区西部的一个村，西边距荷（泽）考（城）公路十六里路。麦后，保长王电文在我行政命令和老积极分子的监督下，回到村里马马虎虎的进行了一下土地改革工作，这时，敌探报告了伪三区“爱民乡”乡长鹿爱雨，鹿将该村保长叫去大训一顿。威胁说：“限三天，退不回，要你的头。”保长请示地主，地主王广菊、王电选说：“你坚决给我们要回来！”于是，农民拿到手里的文约，又退给地主。后来，我武装工作组到该村，群众向我们反映：“俺庄地主反攻啦！还得干，不干站不住脚！”政府根据群众意见，将王继合、麦近、和来喜三个坏蛋敌探枪毙了，群众这时敢抬头了，说：“敌人要东西，要的没数，穷人想抬头就得干，反正霍上啦！”敌人负担也不给送了，群众要求组织看家，积极分子在群众中一活动，组织起十五个。民兵积极分子王××，将去年大杨湖战斗时得的长枪扒出来，跟着区活动的老农会长，也回到村里，带了一支枪，就领导群众看起家来。黑夜自卫队轮流站岗，民兵集中起来查岗和打仗，作为机动力量。这时比较安稳的地方，都已经进行复查啦。该村群众提出“以前咱村搞的胡闹，再搞二火吧”！于是首先将农会、妇会、儿童团恢复起来，接着民兵在西头站着岗，村里进行查浮财，随搞随分。在分浮财时，坏蛋王玉来企图捣乱，威胁群众，群众当场揭发，他许给伪三十分队长鹿德盛扩充一班人，并曾鼓励过五个人投敌，大家提出“不惩办他，王新庄就不会过平和”！在群众一致的要求下，区部判处他死刑。群众酝酿说：“咱庄上坏家灰没有了，咱能站住脚啦，好好干吧！”浮财分下去，接着二次分土地，全村十八家地主富农退出土地两顷五六十亩，这样一来，群众积极提出买枪，他们说：“买支枪能用几个钱，比叫敌人拉走牛强，敌人来了就跟他拼！”民兵每天上区要枪，区里又给了他们几支，村上站住脚了。王新庄的人民从斗争中站住脚了，可是敌人也更注意了，经常想再到这村抢劫。有一天，伪曹县三区“便衣队”四十余人，带一挺歪把机枪，大摇大摆的向王新庄来了，头里四个尖兵快到村跟前，被三个民兵打窜啦。晚上，开了个群众大会，大家站岗更谨慎了，每个岗上搭个小棚，下雨也得看。每轮到王××站岗时，他的年将七十岁的老父亲，一夜要拿着棍子看他几次，再三的嘱咐说：“好好站，敌人过来就没咱活的啦！”叫他睡觉去，他不肯，说：“我比您还有精神，多一个人多一分力量啊！”该村曾一连打退过敌人四、五次进攻，有几次岗上一＠呼，敌人不敢挨近村就跑啦。从此，敌人再不敢往这村来了。又一次，伪三区一分队给养批到东三张家，二分队批到王新庄。拂晓，一分队将粮食要起了，二分队要求一分队配合到王新庄催粮，一分队提出：“受了损失谁担当？”二分队不敢单独到王新庄，半路上就回去啦。一次，我华野战部队从该村路过，民兵大声喊道：“站住，那一部分？过来一个人！”队伍进到村里一看是民兵，称赞说：“这民兵管事，送给他们一支好步枪。”住西三里的村庄，敌人经常到王新庄的地也大部在村西，庄稼熟了，村里自动搞起全村劳力大互助，民兵持枪在外线掩护，青壮年腰里插着手弹，在二线收割，老弱妇孺在村子周围，用大推磨的方法一圈一圈的突击收割。王新庄的庄稼全部收到场里了，并耩上了麦子，全村群众非常满意。自王新庄成立民兵看起家来，敌人没进该村过一次，没抢走过一个钱的东西，没负担过敌人一粒粮食，群众都说：“要不是这几棵枪，咱村早就没法治啦！”在王新庄武装斗争胜利的影响下，边沿各村也先后武装起来了，在全小区村干会上一说，联防各村都很坚固，并议决全小区供给联防队给养、子弹，东部比较安稳村庄说：“西边村上站住脚，俺干部也就保险啦。”于是，由王新庄的武装看家发展为全小区的抗敌联防铁墙。（冀鲁豫分社）
