　　Nanliu Village's Agricultural and Sideline Combination is Good;
　　Everyone Benefits from Mutual Aid
　　[Report from this newspaper, Jinnan, 27th] Under the leadership of labor hero Yuan Zhaolin, the production mutual aid in Nanliu Village, Qiu County, is active in production and has a good combination of agricultural and sideline industries. One-third of the households in the village have achieved a surplus. For example, the elderly Shi Runsheng and his wife, who are over sixty years old, returned from famine in the western countryside last March, carrying a large satchel, with nothing else. Zhaolin lent him eighty catties of mung beans and asked him to join the mutual aid to grind flour. His wife is blind and can only spin thread, so she spins cotton with Kelin's wife. With the money they earned, they bought three acres of land and reclaimed seven acres of wasteland. This year, they harvested two bags of sorghum, two bags of millet, two bags of beans, and a hundred catties of cotton, enough for the two of them to eat for more than a year. In addition, they can eat some residue from grinding flour, so the grain is enough for two years. Dong Cunshan returned from famine last March, wearing a tattered sheepskin and in great difficulty. After joining mutual aid, this year he harvested eleven bags of millet, eight bags of sorghum, five bags of beans, and two hundred catties of cotton. Including grinding flour, the grain is enough for his family of three to eat for more than two years, and he even wants to buy a cow. There are many similar households, and this year's harvest is enough to eat for two years. Nanliu Village is sandy soil, and there is no harvest without fertilizer. Because the flour mill can accumulate fertilizer, grinding flour has become the main sideline industry in Nanliu Village, with every household participating. There is not a single idle person in the village. The village has twelve mutual aid groups and twelve flour mills. Even during the busy autumn harvest and wheat planting season, grinding flour has not stopped. During weeding, they grind in the morning, with each group grinding thirty-five catties of beans a day. Now, each group rushes to grind in the evening because the nights are longer. Each group grinds an average of fifty catties, with a maximum of one hundred catties. According to statistics, the village's sideline production profit from August 15th to September 15th was 24,000 catties of ground beans, earning 12,000 catties of beans (earning one catty for every two catties ground). Calculated at one hundred yuan per catty of beans, the total profit was 1.2 million yuan. It also feeds ninety pigs and thirty-nine cattle. Grinding flour alone can accumulate twenty-four carts of fertilizer. The masses deeply feel the benefits of mutual aid. For example, Jiao Zhenbang, the director of the farmers' association, is disabled. After participating in mutual aid, he can grind flour in the cooperative, which is equivalent to a whole laborer. He eats in the cooperative and cannot eat the things harvested from the fields. If he did not participate in mutual aid, he would not be able to survive. The widowed Jiao Wangshi and Li Tonghai help each other, which solved the difficulties of food and clothing for both parties. Dong Tingxing cannot fully support himself, but joining mutual aid has solved his problem, and he is living a good life. Dong Xixin's group has seven people, all poor peasants. After mutual aid, they solved the difficulty of agricultural implements and sideline tools. The whole group has everything they need and feels very convenient. Xixin said, "Mutual aid is really good. Chairman Mao really came up with this method, which greatly benefits the poor." Because they have victoriously exceeded the production increase target and greatly increased their wealth, they were fully prepared to pay off the principal and interest of 820,000 yuan when they collected agricultural loans this time, in just two days. The masses in the village are also preparing to buy ten more cattle and have already bought three donkeys and a large cart. The village chief said confidently, "We will strive to raise fifty cattle next year."

　　南刘村农副结合好
  　人人沾了互助的光
    【本报冀南二十七日电】邱县一区南刘村的生产互助，在劳动英雄袁兆林领导下，由于生产的积极，农副业结合的好，全村三分之一的户达到耕一余一。如年过花甲的石润生老俩口，去年三月从西乡逃荒回来，背着一个大挎篓，别的东西一点也没有。兆林借给他八十斤绿豆，叫他参加互助磨粉。他老婆是个瞎子，只能纺线，给克林媳妇在一块纺花。赚了钱要三亩地，又开荒七亩，今年收了两口袋高粱、两口袋谷子、两口袋豆子、百斤棉花，够他俩口吃一年多，再加上磨粉吃些渣浆，粮食足够吃二年的。董存山去年三月间逃荒回来，身上披着一张破羊皮，非常困难。参加互助后，今年收了谷子十一口袋、高梁八口袋、豆子五口袋、棉花二百斤，加上磨粉，一家三口人粮食吃二年多吃不了，还想买一头牛。类似这样户很多，今年的收成都够吃二年的。南刘村是沙地，不上粪不收，因为粉坊能积肥，所以磨粉就成了南刘村的主要副业，家家参加，村中没有一个闲人。全村十二个互助组，十二盘粉磨，在秋收种麦正忙时，磨粉也没有停止。在锄草时早晨磨，一天一组磨三十五斤豆。现在各组都赶到晚上磨，因夜长，各组平均磨五十斤，最多到一百斤。该村副业生产获利，据统计自八月十五至九月十五一个月全村磨二万四千斤，赚一万二千斤豆（磨二斤赚一斤），按每百元一斤豆算，共赚洋一百二十万元。并喂九十个猪及三十九头牛，光磨粉能积肥二十四车。群众都深深的感觉到互助的好处，如农会主任焦振邦，是个残废，参加了互助，在合作社内磨面，能顶一个整劳力，在社内吃饭，地里收的东西吃不着。如不参加互助，生活就没法过。孤寡焦王氏与李同海互助，双方解决了吃穿的困难。董廷兴自己活不全，参加了互助就解决了，并且过的日子很好。董希辛组七个人，都是贫农，互助起来后，解决农具及副业工具的困难，全组使啥有啥，感到非常方便。希辛说：“互助起来真好，毛主席真能想这个办法，使穷人沾光不小。”由于胜利的超过了增产任务，财富大大增加，在这次收农业贷款时，只准备了两天，将本利八十二万元完全交清。该村群众并准备再买十头牛，现已买到驴三头、大车一辆。村长很有信心的说：“明年争取喂到五十头牛。”
