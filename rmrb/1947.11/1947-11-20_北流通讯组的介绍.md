　　I. General Introduction

　　The Beiliu Correspondence Group has become a banner in the correspondence network of Licheng's rural areas. Beiliu is a model production village in the county. In recent years, with the development of the great production movement (Note: last year, they achieved a surplus after tilling), the emancipated peasants are eager to improve their cultural level and want to publicize all their work, especially the many model deeds in the production movement. Many young men and women, and activists, have automatically formed study groups in various mutual aid teams, textile groups, factories, and workshops, and subscribed to literacy books. They started by writing letters and notes to each other, then developed to writing articles, and further organized themselves to form a systematic mass propaganda and education organization. Based on the progress of the production movement, they carry out propaganda and mobilization, and put forward central slogans, truly becoming the locomotive of work. These people are correspondents for the mass blackboard newspapers and also correspondents for the radio station. According to statistics from the first half of this year, the number has grown from six before last winter to fifty, with one more woman than men, and three boys and three girls each (Note: According to another material from Yang Ke, 41 of them are heroes, village cadres, and activists in factories, workshops, and mutual aid teams). Most of them are illiterate or have a rudimentary knowledge of writing, but 30 of them are regular contributors. According to statistics from just four months of this year, the village Propaganda and Liaison Committee received 197 articles, used 151 of them, and also forwarded nine to the county's small newspaper, not including those forwarded to the Xinhua Daily and the People's Daily (Note: This newspaper received 26 articles from May to August this year, and used 15 of them). The forms of the articles, in addition to six ballad lyrics, thirteen small flower operas, and fourteen folk songs, are all quick clapper rhymes. In processing the articles, the village Propaganda and Liaison Committee has editing and reviewing sections. Elementary school teachers and volunteer teachers serve as editors, and the village chief and political director are responsible for reviewing, with adjudicators selected from the production brigade. The articles are first judged and approved by them to avoid mistakes.

　　In this way, the blackboard newspaper and the radio station have become the most powerful weapons for the village's propaganda and education work, not only promoting work and commending models, but also becoming a core for organizing worker-peasant correspondence reports, improving their culture, and uniting youth.

　　II. How to Mobilize the Masses to Write Articles, Cultivate and Consolidate Correspondents

　　1. Face the masses and cultivate backbones. As teacher Wang Dongkui said: "We must focus our eyes on the masses, and the effect of helping the masses write an article is stronger than writing three articles ourselves." Because people who can write patiently help, it is also a kind of learning for the correspondents themselves. Woman correspondent Liu Sanchong said: "I originally wanted to go to the cadres school, but the one year of learning to write articles is as good as attending the cadres school."

　　2. Promote collective writing and writing about one's own affairs. If one cannot write oneself, ask others for help, and advocate the method of taking apprentices. This not only expands the correspondence organization, but also improves the masses' enthusiasm and ability to write. The slogan everyone raised is: "Write about your own affairs, write how you do it."

　　3. In order to consolidate correspondents, regulations for earning merit for writing articles and other encouragement methods are established. For example, women correspondents Liu Sanchong and Zhang Shuangying were credited with one merit for writing six articles and having three published. Whoever can organize and cultivate three correspondents is also credited with one merit. Once the county's small newspaper used an article by a woman correspondent and received an encouraging letter, everyone gathered together to read it several times, and their enthusiasm was very high. One night, they even eavesdropped on the materials from a men's mutual aid meeting and immediately wrote it into an article, which was published on the blackboard newspaper early the next morning. Everyone called them "news reporters," and they felt very honored, and their enthusiasm for writing articles was even greater.

　　4. Regularly inform the masses of the reporting guidelines and assign someone to be responsible for receiving and revising articles. Three columns are set up next to the blackboard newspaper: Published Column, Unpublished Column, and Outdated Column. Every article should have its misspellings and wording corrected, and the reasons for publishing, not publishing, or being outdated should be marked in red and returned as study materials.

　　5. Writing articles also transforms one's own thinking. For example, Jin Jinzhi's performance was not very good before, and her family was also disharmonious. Since learning to write articles, she often said to people: "I write articles about the good things people do all day long. If I don't improve, I will be letting down the masses." She has now become an activist in various central tasks.

　　III. The Masses are Willing to Listen to the Radio

　　The Beiliu Village radio is also called the Entertainment Radio, with one main station and three branch stations in the village. It broadcasts on the 3rd, 6th, and 9th of each month, and broadcasts every night if there is urgent business. The broadcasting experience is as follows:

　　1. Divided into three forms: (1) General broadcasting uses martial music, gongs and drums; (2) Summarizing work, emergency calls, or broadcasting major victory news uses refined folk music (sheng, guan, etc.) to attract more attention. For example, when broadcasting the victory of the self-defense war, the old man Liu Heyi got up to listen even though he was lying down; (3) Comprehensive broadcasting, in the form of plaza dramas, small flower operas, and masquerade performances. This is done only when holding a large meeting or summarizing a period of work.

　　2. In terms of content, focus on key points, lively materials, and typical examples in each period. For example, when there was a drought this spring, the masses thought that cotton would not sprout if planted. When Wang Wenzhi was found rushing to plant cotton, it was broadcast, and as a result, the masses planted more than 600 mu of cotton in three days.

　　3. Broadcasting not only guides work, but also reduces the waste of work time from meetings. For example, this year, meetings were suspended for seven days during the rush to hoe seedlings, and work experience was conveyed through broadcasting. The masses reflected: "You can do a good job just by listening to the radio," "You can know the world without going out, and you can know everything sitting at home."

　　IV. Correspondents are also Propagandists, and their Actions are Living Teaching Materials.

　　In addition to the Propaganda and Liaison Committee being specifically responsible for the propaganda work in Beiliu, all correspondents are propagandists. They adopt the method of opening minds with concrete ideas and concrete facts. For example, the military dependent Shen Maihua, whom the masses called "Walnut Cracker," was difficult to get along with, but she was willing to be praised. The old man Duan Fu seized on this point and said to her: "As long as you work hard in production and build a prosperous family, you can be on the blackboard newspaper and the radio station." This immediately opened her mind. Not only did she produce herself, but she also helped other families. She often said to people: "Moving around, you either earn merit or get reported and broadcasted, it's really glorious."

　　Another is to seize the living materials of the time and place in a timely manner, and it is best to seize the positive side and value the achievements, even if they are just budding, the effect is also very large. For example, when drought resistance was being promoted, Liu Shouhe and Liu Guie were found to be saving water, and they were not only posted on the blackboard newspaper and praised on the radio, but also their deeds were publicized among the masses, prompting Liu Bingwu to make a plan for the whole family to save water, promoting a village-wide savings and famine preparedness movement of storing grain and eating vegetables mixed with bran, overcoming the wastefulness of Li Xiangkui and Duan Heidu.

　　V. Seize the Masses' Demands and They Will Love to Watch, and If the Tinder is Ignited, it will Blaze.

　　If the blackboard newspaper wants to promote central work, it must be effective only if the masses like it. The title and content should be clearly distinguished in size, lively and eye-catching, and sometimes can be divided into columns, decorated with colors and flowers. The themes should be short and concise, and the past phenomenon of large areas of lines and lines should be overcome. The writing should be fair and without strange characters. For example, when promoting the conservation movement, the Li Yu Conservation Quick Clapper Rhyme written by Shi Cuilian and Liu Sanchong was published on the blackboard newspaper: "It doesn't rain when there's a drought, Li Yu of Zhaigou, made a plan, to support and transport, eat thin porridge at noon, with poplar leaves, eat coarse noodles in the morning, mixed with more than half bran, save every drop of water, and open up living water for production, doing this, we won't be hungry in famine years." In the transformation of two-wheeled vehicles, the comparison quick clapper rhyme of new and old spinning wheels compiled by Lu Gunping and He Sanyu is: "Women weaving, compare new and old spinning wheels, the new one spins ten liang a day, the old master can spin half a jin a day..." This overcame the women's saying that the two-wheeled vehicle was not easy to use, promoted the village-wide vehicle modification, and improved the weaving quantity. This kind of writing seizes the demands of the masses, so the masses love to watch it. For example, Shen Huagou keeps watching even while carrying dung. Also, if someone's article is published on the blackboard newspaper, he will go to see it at night, and he feels very glorious.

　　The old man Li Guangtian is already fifty-eight years old and has a bit of a strange temper and dislikes meetings that waste work time. After this year's commendation and model education for all the village's model figures, his thinking has changed. He said to people: "Our village's work is like doing someone's family, it is going uphill. No matter what work, as long as you don't fall behind, it's good. Look, no matter what you do, if you have something good, it will be broadcast or published in the newspaper. You can't do nothing when there is work on the road, and the scenery is getting better and better, and the tinder is blowing well." He also wrote to his son at the front, saying: "Don't miss home, things are going well at home. You must kill more enemies and make meritorious contributions for the people." During hoeing, the two wives Zhao Chunxiang and Wang Gai delivered food in the morning and either carried water or fed livestock at home, and also spun half a jin of thread every day. When others asked her if she was tired, she replied: "I'm not tired when it's broadcast on the radio station." The ideological education in the village is constantly being consolidated and improved. Even the old men and women are unwilling to fall behind. They often say: "When the thinking is clear, it's the tinder. If you blow it every day, you have to do it."

　　VI. Rectify the Correspondence Organization and Clarify the Class Standpoint of Writing Articles.

　　At this year's September 1st Commemoration Conference, four landlords were denounced. On the same day, they were refused to attend the conference. Everyone said: "We and the landlords are two families, and these guys must be kicked out of the propaganda and education department." Finally, the correspondence group was changed to a correspondence brigade, and Comrade Zhang Yuxing, a turned-over hero of the village and a first-class cultural and educational model in the county, was selected as the brigade leader, divided into nine groups. It was also proposed to overcome personal reputation and individual heroism, give play to the role of heroic collectives, stand on the peasants' standpoint, reflect the heroic deeds of poor and lower-middle peasants, and honestly serve the turned-over peasants.

　　北流通讯组的介绍
    王培义　杨柯　王东魁　王履魁　王瀚清
    一、一般情况的介绍
    北流通讯组，已成为黎城农村通讯组网中的旗帜。北流是全县生产模范村，近年来大生产运动的开展（按：去年达到耕一余一），翻身农民迫切要求提高文化、要求把一切工作，尤其是生产运动中的许多模范事迹表扬出去。许多男女青年和积极分子都在各个互助组、纺织组、工厂、作坊中自动成立了学习小组，订下识字本。开始互相写信写条子，发展到写稿子，又进一步组织起来，形成了一套有系统的群众性的宣教组织。依据生产运动的进展，进行宣传鼓动和提出中心口号，真正成了工作的火车头。这些人是大众黑板报的通讯员，又是广播台的通讯员。据今年前半年统计由去冬以前的六个发展到五十个，内妇女比男人多一个，男女儿童各三个（按：据杨柯另一材料，其中四十一个是英雄、村干及工厂、作坊、互助组中的积极分子。）。他们大多数是不识字和粗通文字的，但有三十名是经常投稿者。仅根据今年四个月的统计，村宣联会即收到稿件一百九十七件，用了一百五十一件，还转到县小报九件，转到新华日报和人民日报的不在内（按：本报今年五至八四个月收到二十六件，用了十五件）。稿件的形式除了六篇鼓书、十三篇小花戏和十四个歌子外，都是快板。在处理稿件上，村宣联会设有编辑与审查两股，小教及义教任编辑，村长和政治主任负责审查，并有生产大队中选出来的评判员，稿子先经他们评判批准，以免出错。
    这样，黑板报与广播台就成了村宣教工作最有力的武器，不仅推动工作与表扬了模范，而且成了组织工农通讯报导与提高其文化团结青年的一样核心。
    二、怎个发动群众写稿培养与巩固通讯员
    １、要面向群众培养骨干。如教员王东魁说：“眼睛要放到群众中，扶植帮助群众写一篇稿子的作用，比自己写三篇还强”。由于能写的人耐心帮助，对通讯员本身也是一种学习，妇女通讯员刘三虫说：“我本来想去住高校，在一年的学习写稿中，也顶住了住高校。”
    ２、发扬集体写作与自己的事自己写，自己写不来找别人帮助，并提倡带徒弟办法，这样不但扩大了通讯组织，而且提高了群众写作的情绪与能力，大家提的口号是：“自己事自己写，怎样做怎样写。”
    ３、为了巩固通讯员，规定写稿立功和其他鼓励办法。如妇女通讯员刘三虫、张双英连写了六篇登了三篇，就给记了一功，谁能组织与培养三个通讯员也给记一功。一次县小报用了妇女通讯员稿子，并接到勉励的信，大家召集在一起念了好几遍，情绪很高；一个晚上竟偷听了男人互助开会的材料，马上写成稿，第二天一早黑板报登了出来。大家叫她们“新闻记者”，她们感到很光荣，写稿劲头更大。
    ４、要经常告群众报导方针，并责成专人负责收稿、改稿。在黑板报旁分设三栏，刊登栏、未登栏、失时栏，每件稿都应修改错字及话句，用红笔批明登与未登或失时的原因，退回作为研究学习材料。
    ５、写稿对自己思想也有改造，如：靳金枝以前表现不甚好，家庭也弄的不和，自学习写稿后，她常对人说：“我成天写稿写人的好处，我要是再不好就对不起群众了”。她现在已成为各种中心工作的积极分子。
    三、群众都愿听广播
    北流村的广播又叫文娱广播，全村一个总台三个分台。逢三、六、九广播，有要紧事就每天黑夜广播。广播经验如下：
    １、分为三种形式：（一）一般广播是用武音乐敲锣打鼓；（二）总结工作、紧急号召或广播大的胜利消息就用文音乐（笙管等）细吹细打，更引人注意。如广播自卫战争的胜利时，刘合义老汉躺了还起来听；（三）综合广播，形式是广场剧、小花戏、化装表演。这是开大会或总结了一个时期的工作时才这样做。
    ２、内容上按各个时期抓重点，抓活材料和典型的。如今春天旱时，群众认为种棉出不来，发现王文治抢垧种棉时就广播，结果群众在三天内种了六百多亩棉。
    ３、广播不但能指导工作，而且减少了开会的误工。如今年在抢锄苗中有七天停止开会，通过广播把工作经验都传达下去了。群众反映是：“光听广播也能办好工作”，“不出门的知天下，坐在家里啥事也能知道”。
    四、通讯员又是宣传员，行动就是活教材。
    北流的宣传工作，除了宣联会具体分工负责外，所有的通讯员都是宣传员。采用具体思想用具体事实打通的方式。如军属老婆申麦花，群众叫她“夹核桃”很难共事，可是她愿叫人说好，段肤老汉就抓住这点给她说：“只要好好劳动生产发家，就能上黑板报与广播台。”这一下，她思想通了，不但自己生产而且还帮助别人家。她常对人说：“动弹了，不是立功就是上报上广播，真光荣。”　
    再一个是及时抓住当时当地活的材料，最好抓住积极面，看的起成绩，那怕是萌芽的，作用也很大。如抗旱节约时发现了刘守河、刘贵娥开始节约，除黑板报登了，广播台表扬了，还在群众中宣传他们的事迹，使刘丙午订出全家节约的计划，推动了全村家家储蓄备荒粮，掺糠吃菜的节约运动，克服了李向魁、段黑犊的浪费现象。
    五、抓住群众要求群众就爱看，想通了底火就吹起来了。
    黑板报要想推动中心工作，必须使群众喜爱才能有效。标题和内容大小分明，生动醒目，有时可分栏，带色插花，题材短小精干，要克服过去行行条条一大片的现象，字写公正，不用怪字。如推动节约运动时，黑板报上登出石翠连、刘三虫编写的李玉春节约快板：“天旱不下雨，寨沟李玉春，订出计划来，支差捎运输，晌午吃涝饭，抿是杨桃叶，早晨吃粗面，掺糠一多半，节约省死水，生产开活水，这样做下去，荒年不受饥。”在改造两轮车时，路棍平、何三玉编的新旧纺花车对比快板是：“妇女纺织起，新旧纺车来对比，新的初纺一天纺十两，旧的好把式一天纺半斤……”，克服了妇女对两轮车不好使用的说法，推动了全村改车，提高了纺织数量。这种写法是抓住了群众的要求，所以群众就爱看，如申花狗担着粪还一直看。又如在黑板报上登出了谁的稿子，他在黑夜还去看报，他感到非常的光荣。
    李光田老汉已五十八岁，脾气有些怪，嫌开会误工，经过了今年对全村模范人物的表功表模的教育，他的思想转变了，对人说：“咱村的工作就和做人家一样，是走上坡，不论啥工作只要不落后就好，你瞧吧，不论你做啥有一点好，不是广播就是登报，路有活不做也不行，光景往好里过，底火吹的不行。”他又给他儿往前方写信说：“你不要想家，家里过的很好，你要多杀敌人为民立功。”在锄苗中赵春香、王改两个老婆早晨送饭，在家里不是担水就是喂牲口，每天还纺半斤线，别人问她就不嫌累？她回答说：“广播台上一广播就不累了。”该村的思想教育是在不断逐步巩固与提高中，就是老婆老汉都不愿落后，他们常说：“思想通了就是底火，天天吹的不干不行。”
    六、整顿通讯组织，明确写稿的阶级立场。
    今年九一纪念大会上检举出四个地主，当天便拒绝他们参加大会，大家说：“咱与地主是两家人，这些家伙要踢出他宣教部门”。最后把通讯组改为通讯大队，选该村翻身英雄及全县一等文教模范张玉兴同志为大队长，划分为九个小组。并提出克服个人名誉个人英雄主义，发挥英雄集体的作用，站在农民立场上，反映贫雇农英雄事实，要老老实实的为翻身农民服务。
