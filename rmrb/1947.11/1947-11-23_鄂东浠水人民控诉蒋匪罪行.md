　　Xinhua News Agency, Hubei-Henan-Anhui Front, 19th: Frontline correspondent Tang Pingzhu reports: On the morning of November 1st, this reporter accompanied PLA soldiers escorting a group of prisoners from the 40th Division through the city of Xishui. When merchants saw these prisoners walking docilely, recalling how these same people had strutted into the city six days prior, flaunting their power and glaring at the common people, one merchant glared at the group of prisoners and said, "Where is your prestige now? Why don't you rob? Why don't you conscript laborers?" An old woman suddenly grabbed a prisoner and said, "It was you who stole my fur coat." The crowd surrounded the prisoner, scaring him until his face turned red. A PLA soldier劝说道 advised, "Old woman, don't be angry. He used to be a Chiang soldier and harmed the people. Now that he's with the PLA, we must educate him to mend his ways." Only then did the old woman let go. At this moment, a wounded conscript came over. He shouted, "I am from Liujiawan in Huanggang. Three people from my village were conscripted together. The two who couldn't carry the ammunition died on the way after being beaten to death by them. They wounded my leg at Gaoshanpu. If it weren't for the PLA doctor changing my bandages and stopping the bleeding, I wouldn't be alive now. Along the way, the bandit troops conscripted three to four hundred laborers, and many were beaten to death." At this point, an old gentleman interjected, "There's an old man named Xu in Dongguan who runs a cigarette stand. The 'Central Army' insisted on taking him as a porter. He said, 'I am already seventy-six years old and cannot carry anything.' Those bastards unreasonably said, 'Even seventy-six-year-olds have to go.' As a result, the old man Xu was exhausted to death halfway there."

　　鄂东浠水人民控诉蒋匪罪行
    【新华社鄂豫皖前线十九日电】前线通讯员唐平铸报导：十一月一日晨，记者随解放军战士们护送一批四十师的俘虏从浠水城里经过，商民们看见这批俘虏驯服地走着，想起在六天前同样是这批人进城时，耀武扬威，怒眉瞪眼，吓唬老百姓，有个商人怒目指着俘虏群说：“你的威风那里去了，怎么不抢了，怎么不拉民夫？”一个老太太忽然抓住一个俘虏说：“就是你把我的皮袄抢走了”。人群把那个俘虏围起来，吓得他面红耳赤。解放军战士劝说道：“老太太不要生气，他以前当蒋军，坑害老百姓，现在到了解放军，我们要好好教育他改邪归正。”老太太这才放开手。这时又过来一个被打伤了的民夫，他高声喊着：我是黄冈刘家畈人，我村三个人一齐被拉来当夫，那两个挑子弹挑不动，在半路上被他们打死了，我在高山铺被他们把我的腿打伤了，要不是解放军医生给我换药止血，我也活不成了。一路上土匪队伍拉了三四百民夫，好多人都被打死了。”说到这里，有位老先生插言道：“东关有个姓许的老头摆纸烟摊，‘中央军’硬要拉他去当挑夫，他说我已七十六岁了，挑不动了，那些混蛋家伙横不讲理说：‘七十六岁也要去。’结果那个姓许的老头挑到半路上累死了。”
