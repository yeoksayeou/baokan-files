　　Chiang Kai-shek Bandits Allow Foreign Goods Dumping
    September Trade Deficit Reaches 800 Billion
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th. The Chiang-controlled areas' foreign trade deficit for September has reached an unprecedented high. According to a Reuters dispatch from Shanghai on the 25th, citing statistics from Chiang Kai-shek's customs, and figures published by the Central News Agency on the 24th, the Chiang-controlled areas' foreign trade "imports have set a new record" in September, with a total value of 1,076,687,269,000 yuan, exceeding the total export value of 286,725,778,000 yuan by 275 percent, with a trade deficit of nearly 790 billion yuan (all in Chiang currency). Converted at the official exchange rate of 12,000 yuan, the total loss of foreign exchange is more than 65.8 million US dollars, "the highest monthly trade deficit since the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan." This fact completely proves that Xu Baiyuan, Deputy Minister of Finance of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, told a reporter from the Associated Press on the 20th that "since the establishment of the new foreign exchange policy on August 17, exports have begun to increase, and their value has slightly increased compared to imports in the past two months," which is purely self-deception. According to Reuters, the value of imports such as cotton and cotton yarn in that month was greater than in the past, while the export volume of bristles, tea, metals, and tung oil decreased by 20 to 40 percent. According to previous reports from various sources, the total trade deficit in the Chiang-controlled areas for the first six months of this year was more than 260 billion yuan, the trade deficit in July was more than 480 billion yuan, the trade deficit in August was more than 460 billion yuan, and the total trade deficit for the eight months from January to August was more than 1.2 trillion yuan, equivalent to more than 100 million US dollars.

　　蒋匪放任外货倾销
    九月份入超八千亿
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】蒋管区九月份对外贸易入超空前增高。据路透社上海二十五日电所引蒋海关之统计，及中央社二十四日发表之数字，蒋区九月份对外贸易“进口已创新纪录”，其总值高达一万零七百六十六亿八千七百二十六万九千元，超过出口总值二千八百六十七亿二千五百七十七万八千元百分之二百七十五，入超几达七千九百亿元（以上均蒋币）。以官价汇率一万二千元折算，共损失外汇六千五百八十余万美元。“为抗日战争结束以来每月入超中最高之一次”。此一事实完全证明蒋匪财政部次长徐柏园于二十日向美联社记者所称：“自八月十七日外汇新政策建立以来，出口已开始提高，其价值于过去两月中均较进口略有增加”纯为自欺欺人之谈。据路透社称：该月份进口中，棉花、棉纱等数值均较以往为大，而猪鬃、茶叶、金属及桐油等之出口量，则降低百分之廿至四十。据以前各方报导：蒋区今年上半年六个月入超总和为二千六百余亿元，七月份入超四千八百余亿元，八月份入超四千六百余亿元，一月至八月八个月入超总和为一万二千余亿元，约合美金一亿余元。
