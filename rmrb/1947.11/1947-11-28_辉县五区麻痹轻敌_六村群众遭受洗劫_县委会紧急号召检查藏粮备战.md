　　Huixian Fifth District Neglectful and Underestimates the Enemy
　　Six Villages Suffer Looting
    County Committee Issues Emergency Call to Inspect Grain Storage and Prepare for War

    [Reported by this newspaper] Due to the Huixian Fifth District’s neglect and underestimation of the enemy, it has suffered serious losses. The county committee of the county has issued an emergency call to organize armed forces, inspect grain storage and prepare for war, and crush Chiang Kai-shek's bandits from looting grain. On the 2nd of this month, more than 2,500 Chiang bandits from Xinxiang, Huixian, and Ji counties, colluding with more than 1,000 traitorous bullies and landlords, using more than 100 cars and carts, suddenly broke into Yanglvchuan area of our Fifth District to loot grain. They dug three feet into the ground, burned houses, robbed clothing and grain, slaughtered cattle and sheep, chopped down jujube and persimmon trees, smashed pots and bowls, and threw buckets and well ropes into the wells... The sweeping lasted for six days, and six villages including Zhangcun were almost completely reduced to scorched earth! The Huixian County Committee has issued an emergency call to the masses of the Fifth District to arm themselves and launch a more tenacious struggle against Chiang bandits and traitorous bullies and landlords. It pointed out: The closer Chiang bandits get to their death, the more sinister and cruel they become. Our understanding of this is insufficient, and our neglect and underestimation of the enemy has caused us painful losses. Only by thoroughly emptying our houses and clearing the fields can we crush Chiang bandits' looting. We must break the old methods, strictly control the landlords, and mobilize the masses to discuss and create new methods. Organize armed masses, organize front and rear headquarters, the rear manages the masses to transfer and retreat, and the front leads the militia to fight guerrillas. At the same time, it also instructed all districts to raise donations, organize慰问团, to provide relief to the masses in the Fifth District, and to make them deeply aware of the cruelty of the enemy, further return to the village to inspect grain storage and prepare for war, and thoroughly do a good job in emptying houses and clearing the fields.
