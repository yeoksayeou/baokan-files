Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. Guilin Dispatch: Rong County, on the banks of the Rong River in southwestern Guangxi, is the hometown of Huang Shaoxiong, Vice President of the Chiang Party's Control Yuan, and Huang Xuchu, Chairman of Guangxi Province. The political, economic, and military power of the entire county is controlled by feudal despots. The position of county magistrate is always held by the henchmen of the two Huangs. The current county magistrate, Huang Baofang, is Huang Shaoxiong's cousin. Rural regimes are always controlled by local bullies and gentry. The large landlords in the county own land rents of 10,000 to 20,000 shi and a large amount of armament. These packs of wolves use high land rents, usury, and Chiang Kai-shek's "three requisitions policy" of conscription, grain requisition, and purchasing to besiege the people. Most painfully, they seize young men for conscription in the middle of the night. The people could no longer endure it, and they united with the people of Teng County, Beiliu County, and other counties, and elected Huang Weiruo, a teacher at the Rong County Private Chengcheng Middle School, which had been disbanded, to lead the organization of the "Democratic League Revolutionary Army," with more than 200 people. On the night of March 12th this year, they rose up in rebellion and attacked Rong County Town. At that time, there were more than 200 police soldiers of the Chiang bandit county government in the city, equipped with new equipment such as light and heavy machine guns. However, under the heroic attack of the rebel peasants, County Magistrate Huang Baofang was the first to flee in panic, and the police soldiers had no intention of fighting, abandoning their weapons and fleeing. The Democratic League Revolutionary Army took the city in one fell swoop. After entering the city, they posted slogans everywhere such as "Oppose conscription, grain requisition, and purchasing, realize democratic independence and peace, overthrow fascism, overthrow traitors, everyone wants food, everyone wants work, everyone wants to study." They safely withdrew by the next morning. After the Democratic League Revolutionary Army withdrew, all the corrupt officials and local bullies in the county lost their souls, and the landlords' armed forces in various places watched each other, daring not to move forward. Three days later, Lin Fangmian sent more than 100 security guards, but like startled birds, they arrived during the day and immediately fled back to Lin at night. Rumors spread, and the Chiang bandit provincial government was also panic-stricken, unable to send troops because it had no soldiers to send. It frantically pieced together more than 400 security guards to come and suppress them after 16 days, but the Democratic League Revolutionary Army had already established a foothold in @ Mountain. Now the Democratic League Revolutionary Army is developing and growing stronger, and the Chiang family bandit gang in Guangxi Province turns pale at the mention of it.

    广西人民组民主联盟革命军
    一度攻入容县县城
    在＠山扎住脚跟正发展壮大
    【新华社陕北四日电】桂林通讯：桂西南容江之滨的容县，是蒋党监察院副院长黄绍雄、桂省主席黄旭初的家乡，全县政治、经济、军事大权都操在封建恶霸之手，县长一职总出不了二黄爪牙的圈子，现任县长黄葆芳就是黄绍雄的族侄，乡村政权总是土豪劣绅把持；县里的大地主拥有地租一万石至二万石及大量武装。这成群的虎狼用高额地租、高利贷和蒋介石的征兵、征粮、征购的“三征政策”来围攻人民，最痛心的是半夜捉壮丁，人民忍无可忍，乃联合藤县、北流等县人民，推举已被解散的容县私立成城中学的教师黄未若领导组织“民主联盟革命军”，共二百余人，于今年三月十二日夜揭竿起义，进攻容县县城。当时城内有蒋匪县府的警兵二百余人，且拥有轻重机枪等新式装备，但在起义农民的英勇的冲杀下，县长黄葆芳首先落荒而走，警兵也无心恋战，纷纷弃械逃奔，民主联盟革命军一鼓而克该城。入城后到处张贴“反对征兵征粮征购、实现民主独立和平、打倒法西斯、打倒汉奸、大家要饭吃、大家要事做、大家要书读”等标语。至翌晨安全撤退。民主联盟革命军撤退后，全县贪污土劣失魂落魄，各地地主武装互相观望，莫敢向前，三天后林方面才派来保安队百余人，但如惊弓之鸟白天刚到，夜晚立即逃回林。谣言纷传，蒋匪省政府亦惶恐万分，派兵又无兵可派，手忙脚乱了十六天，才拼凑了保安队四百余人前来镇压，但民主联盟革命军早已到＠山扎住脚跟了。现在民主联盟革命军正在发展壮大，而桂省蒋家匪帮对此均谈虎变色。
