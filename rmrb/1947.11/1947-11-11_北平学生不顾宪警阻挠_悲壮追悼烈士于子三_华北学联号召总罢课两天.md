　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th. A compilation of United Press dispatches from Beiping on the 7th and 8th: Students in the Chiang-controlled areas are advancing, holding high the just torch of anti-oppression and striving for freedom. The North China Student Federation, composed of schools in Beiping, Tianjin, Tangshan, and other areas, on the 8th called for a two-day general strike by all universities and middle schools in the Chiang-controlled areas of North China, to condemn Chiang Kai-shek's new fascist atrocities during the student strike.

　　On the 7th, when students from various schools in Beiping held a memorial service for Zhejiang University martyr Yu Zisan, Chiang Kai-shek dispatched two truckloads of fully armed military police and a large number of police and secret agents in an attempt to obstruct it. When the first group of more than two thousand students from Peking University arrived at the venue, they were attacked with stones by Chiang Kai-shek's military police and secret agents, and six students were arrested on the spot. Chiang Kai-shek's obstruction plan was declared a failure under the heroic insistence of thousands of students, and the memorial service was still held in a tragic atmosphere. Zhou Binglin, Dean of the Law School of Peking University, expressed his support for the students' strike in his speech and denounced Chiang Kai-shek's illegality in arresting students for more than a month without trial. Another professor in the Economics Department of Peking University also expressed the same opinion in his speech.

　　During the strike, Chiang Kai-shek continuously used fascist methods to deal with the students. On the 6th, more than 30 agents of the Chiang Kai-shek Youth Corps rushed into the Beiping Normal College and beat student representatives at the meeting with lead pipes. Six of the injured students have been sent to the hospital for treatment. On the evening of the 5th, four students from Yenching University and Tsinghua University were once kidnapped by Chiang Kai-shek in trucks. According to a spokesman for the Student Union, Chiang Kai-shek's fascist actions have aroused more heroic resistance from the students. The students are extremely angry and have voted to continue the strike until the arrested students are freed, and will hold a large demonstration.

　　北平学生不顾宪警阻挠
    悲壮追悼烈士于子三
  　华北学联号召总罢课两天
    【新华社陕北九日电】综合合众社七、八两日北平电讯：蒋管区学生高举反压迫争自由的正义火炬前进，由平、津、唐山等各学校组成的华北学联，八日号召华北蒋管区所有大、中学进行总罢课两天，以声讨蒋匪在学生罢课期中新的法西斯暴行。
    七日，北平各学校学生举行浙大于子三烈士追悼会时，蒋匪派出两卡车全付武装宪兵及大量警察特务，企图阻挠。当北大第一批学生两千余人到达会场时，即遭蒋匪宪警特务以石头殴击，并当场捕去学生六人。蒋匪阻挠计划在数千学生英勇坚持下宣告破产，追悼会仍在悲壮气氛中举行。北大法学院院长周炳琳在致词中，表示支持学生罢课行动，并痛斥蒋匪逮捕学生月余不加审判的非法性。北大经济系另一教授在致词中亦作同样表示。
    在罢课期间，蒋匪以连续性法西斯举行对付学生。六日，蒋匪三青团特务三十余人曾冲入北平师范学院，以铅管殴打会场学生代表，受伤学生中六人已送医院疗治。五号晚，燕大、清华学生四人一度遭蒋匪以卡车绑去。据学生会发言人表示：蒋匪法西斯行动激起学生更英勇的反抗。学生情绪激愤异常，已投票决定继续罢课，直至被捕学生获得自由；并将举行大示威。
