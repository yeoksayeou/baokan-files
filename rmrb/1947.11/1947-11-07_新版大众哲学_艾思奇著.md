    New Edition of *Popular Philosophy*
    By Ai Siqi
    In the preface to the new edition, the author says: "The shortcomings of the old edition are: 1. When writing, I was in the KMT-controlled area, and many viewpoints could not be written very clearly; examples could only be ordinary examples. 2. Limited by the author's theoretical level at the time, I did not take solving the practical problems of the Chinese revolution as the fundamental starting point, and naturally there were some erroneous arguments. This revision has tried my best to correct these shortcomings. In terms of content, it is fundamentally different from the old edition."
    The new version was added and deleted by the author from last year to July this year. Many chapters use real events from the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Self-Defense War as examples, which are of great help to a revolutionary worker on how to establish his own worldview and outlook on life, so as to further seek various laws of revolutionary struggle.
              The whole book is more than 200,000 words and will be published soon.

### 新版大众哲学  艾思奇著

    新版大众哲学
    艾思奇著
    作者在新版序言里说：“旧版的缺点：一、写作时处在蒋管区，许多观点，不可能写得很明确；举例也只能举普通例子。二、限于当时作者的理论水平，没有把解决中国革命的实际问题为根本着眼点，自然便带有某些错误的论点。这一次修改已尽自己力量想把这些缺点改正。就内容说：它和旧本已基本不同。”
    新版本是作者去年至今年七月增删的，许多章节内都以抗战和自卫战争中的实事为例，对一个革命工作者如何奠立自己的世界观与人生观，从而进一步来寻求革命斗争的各种规律，有很大帮助。
              全书二十余万言，不日即可出版。
