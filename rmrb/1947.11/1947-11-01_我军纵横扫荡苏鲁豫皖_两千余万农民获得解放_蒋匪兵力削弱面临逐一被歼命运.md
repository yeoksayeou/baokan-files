Xinhua News Agency, Front Lines of Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui, 30th: Our front-line reporter reports on the victorious situation of the large-scale counter-offensive by the Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui Liberation Army in the past month, stating: After the Chen-Su troops crossed the Longhai Railway southward on September 26th and launched a large-scale offensive, they were invincible. The Jiangsu, Anhui, and Henan Liberated Areas have thus ended the situation of independently persisting in guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, transforming into one of the main battlefields of the national counter-offensive.

In the past month, the Liberation Army swept across the vast plains west of Hongze Lake, east of the Pinghan Railway, north of the Huai River, stretching over a thousand li east to west and six hundred li north to south. They swept across the Chiang Kai-shek army and Chiang Kai-shek regime, annihilating nearly 10,000 Chiang's security troops and local bandits, capturing nearly twenty-four county towns and dozens of important towns. They cut off the Jinpu and Longhai Railways several times. Wherever the Liberation Army went, after clearing out the remaining enemies, they immediately assisted the masses in carrying out land reform and establishing democratic order. In addition to the original Jiangsu, Anhui, and Henan military and civilians who persisted in fighting behind enemy lines and established three democratic administrative offices south of the Longhai Railway, west of the Jinpu Railway, and north of the Wo River and Dasha River, governing a population of over 10 million, now three new administrative offices have been established south of the Wo River and Dasha River, west of the Yellow River flooded area, and north of the Huai River, governing a population of over 10 million. In total, there are six administrative offices with a population of over 20 million, of which 8 million peasants have already been allocated land. The liberated peasants are supporting and joining the Liberation Army with unparalleled enthusiasm.

In the Huaibei Liberated Area east of the Jinpu Railway, since the Liberation Army captured Qingyang Town and recovered Sixian and Lingbi, inflicting a severe blow on the Chiang bandits, vast areas between Hongze Lake and the southeast of the Shanhe River and the Grand Canal, between Chengzi Lake and the Grand Canal, and in the south and northeast of Sixian and Siyang, and the southern part of Suqian and Suining, and Lingbi have all been recovered. Under the victorious power of our army, the Chiang bandits hurriedly transferred the New 5th Division (formerly the 5th Army) and the Reorganized 10th Division from southwestern Shandong to defend the Zhengzhou-Xuchang line, and transferred the Reorganized 75th Division to defend the Bengbu-Huaiyuan-Fengtai line. The Reorganized 11th Division then scurried to the Haoxian, Woyang, and Mengcheng lines, and the Reorganized 20th Division was strengthened to defend Zhengzhou and its periphery. Furthermore, the Reorganized 28th Division and the Parachute General Corps were transferred from Shandong to defend the Longhai Railway east of Xuzhou and the area east of Suxian. Now, there are approximately 20 brigades of Chiang's bandit troops surrounding the Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui Liberated Areas. However, the few mobile forces that Chiang's bandit troops have are now forced to disperse, and most have been converted into defensive or "traveling march" troops. Due to the weakness of their forces, low morale, and fear of engaging with the main force of the Liberation Army, according to Chiang's bandit's hand order of Shen Dong (September 2nd), he "scolded" his subordinates for "shrinking back and not continuing to advance before 7 a.m. and after 7 p.m., thus marching during the day and resting at night, resembling a traveling march. How can we annihilate the communist bandits and save the crisis?!" Chen Cheng's Shen Han (September 14th) telegram also confessed: "According to reports from the battlefield inspection team, the general troops lack vigorous spirit. Wherever the troops go, they become defensive in nature, only knowing how to defend bunkers, not moving out, not searching, waiting for the Communist 'bandits' to attack, and rarely striving to take the initiative to seek out 'bandits' to fight." This is the true portrayal of Chiang's army. A part of Chiang's bandit's Reorganized 75th Division once occupied Taihe on the 17th, but when the Liberation Army approached the suburbs on the 23rd, the enemy abandoned the city and fled. Even the New 5th Division (formerly the 5th Army), known as one of Chiang's bandit's five main forces, is cowering near Xuchang, not daring to act rashly. The Liberation Army's momentum is huge, pressing Zhengzhou in the west and Xuzhou in the east. On the 26th of this month, they captured Chenliucheng, 45 li southeast of Kaifeng, in one fell swoop, completely annihilating the defending enemy. Chiang's officials in Kaifeng were terrified. As for the remaining Chiang's army in the Luxinan battlefield north of the Longhai Railway, after being subjected to annihilation blows by the Liberation Army one after another, the remnants of the Reorganized 73rd Division, which originally attempted to block the Yellow River, fled east to Dongping, the remnants of the Reorganized 72nd Division fled back to Jining, the Reorganized 84th Division also abandoned Juye and fled east, and the remnants of the Reorganized 68th Division retreated to Heze. Currently, the vast areas of Dingtao, Chengwu, Shanxian, Caoxian, Yuncheng, and Juanxian have all been recovered. There are no traces of the enemy within 400 li from north to south and 180 li from east to west. The entire Luxinan Chiang's army has turned to defense.

Looking at the current war situation in Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui, because the Chen-Su troops have reached the Huai River, they are coordinating with the Liu-Deng troops across the river. In a state of panic, Chiang Kai-shek's gang is transferring its main force south. However, Chiang's bandit troops have only the New 5th Division and the Reorganized 11th Division left as their elite main forces within the customs. Moving them around, they have to rely on them to guard the Pinghan Railway, Longhai Railway, Jinpu Railway, and other transportation lines, and they also have to guard important strategic cities such as Zhengzhou, Xuchang, Kaifeng, Xuzhou, and Bengbu. They also have to "traveling march," providing eastern support and western rescue. As a result, they have to be dispersed, making it convenient for the Liberation Army to choose the fattest to eat. The fierce momentum of Chiang's bandit troops concentrating 20 to 30 reorganized divisions to attack the Yilu mountainous area three months ago is gone forever. The Chiang's army in Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui is facing the fate of being annihilated one by one. Chiang's bandit army will never be able to stop the powerful offensive of the Liberation Army like a surging spring tide.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 27th: Chiang's bandit troops are implementing a policy of destruction in the Luxinan area, with shocking killing and looting. In the ten-plus counties north of the Longhai Railway, incomplete statistics for August and September alone show that at least 45,000 people were conscripted. Those who resisted slightly were tortured and killed on the spot, with 200 people killed in one district of Caoxian. Villages passed through by Chiang's bandit troops are characterized by dilapidated farmhouses, pigs, sheep, chickens, and ducks eaten up, trees cut down, firewood burned, grain looted, and furniture and farm implements destroyed. Corpses, bloodstains, rubble, and debris are scattered all over the ground, a horrible sight to behold. Thirty-five villages in the northern countryside of Dangshan County have become an uninhabited wilderness. The Chiang's bandit's Reorganized 5th Division, combined with the "Returning Home Corps," recently scurried to Yuncheng area, and their cruelty exceeded the Japanese invaders' "Three Alls" policy. In a certain village in Yuncheng, more than 60 women, regardless of age, were collectively raped by a battalion of this division. Chiang's aircraft bombed and strafed without interruption day and night. Civilian ships on the Yellow River were often bombed and strafed. From August 8th to 13th alone, 800 merchants and travelers were killed and drowned. On September 24th, Chiang's bandit's 84th Division invaded the Luolou ferry in Yuncheng and sank four civilian boats full of passengers on the river, with hundreds of merchants, women, and children dying in the bullets and waves. The local people's response to the atrocities is "resolute revenge." Guerrilla warfare and the explosion movement in the area are expanding more widely. Our county and district cadres have put forward the slogan "The county does not leave the county, the district does not leave the district." Even in extremely difficult environments, they do not withdraw and lead the masses to persist in the struggle in their original places. When all villages in the third district of Chengwu were occupied, the cadres still led the militia to ambush the enemy in the green gauze tents and bushes to snipe at the enemy and capture scattered soldiers and special agents. Cadre Han Fugui captured 21 bandits in ten days. A certain district secretary of Juye led the militia to raid the bandit's guard force, capturing 28 people in three times. This made the "Returning Home Corps" who attempted to return to the village to restore their rule dare not move. Anti-looting and anti-enemy support movements were also launched in various places. A few days ago, the puppet sixth district of Yuncheng ordered each mu of land to be levied two silver dollars. The order was carried out by Liu, a member of the "Returning Home Corps," and handed over to Li, the puppet village chief of Shenqiao Village. That night, we arrested Liu and Li, so that the puppet district dared not extort from the strongholds. The news of the victory of the great counter-offensive has further increased the confidence of the masses in the area to win the struggle. They said: "When the big river is low, the small rivers will dry up." Draftees who were conscripted also fled back in large numbers during our army's counter-offensive, and those who did not escape continued to destroy the enemy's weapons and disintegrate their morale.

    我军纵横扫荡苏鲁豫皖
    两千余万农民获得解放
    蒋匪兵力削弱面临逐一被歼命运
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线三十日电】本社前线记者报导一个月来苏鲁豫皖解放军大反攻胜利形势称：陈粟大军于九月二十六日南越陇海路，展开大规模攻势作战后，所向无敌，豫皖苏解放区从此结束了独立坚持敌后游击战争的局面，一变而为全国大反攻主要战场之一。一个月来，解放军席卷洪泽湖以西、平汉路以东、淮河以北、东西千余里，南北六百余里的广大平原，纵横扫荡蒋军蒋政权，歼灭蒋保安团队近万人，攻克县城近廿四座及重要市镇数十处，几度截断津浦、陇海两铁路。解放军所到之处，肃清残敌后，即协助群众进行土地改革，建立民主秩序，除原有坚持敌后斗争之豫皖苏军民在陇海路南、津浦路西、涡河与大沙河以北建立之三个民主专署，辖人口一千余万外，现又于涡河与大沙河以南，黄泛区以西、淮河以北新建立三个专署，辖人口一千余万，共计有六个专署，两千余万人口，其中有八百万农民已分得了土地，翻身农民以无比热情支援与参加解放军。津浦路东淮北解放区，自解放军攻克青阳镇，收复泗县、灵壁予蒋匪严重打击后，洪泽湖东南山河与运河间，成子湖与运河间，及泗县、泗阳南东北部，宿迁、睢宁南部，灵壁部广大地区均告恢复。在我大军胜利声威下，蒋匪仓惶从鲁西南抽调新五师（原第五军）、整十师防守郑州至许昌一线，抽调整七十五师防守蚌埠、怀远、凤台一线，整十一师则窜犯毫县、涡阳、蒙城一线，抽调整廿师加强郑州及其外围的防御，又从山东抽调整二十八师及伞兵总队防守徐州以东陇海路及宿县以东地区。现在苏鲁豫皖解放区周围，共有蒋匪军约二十个旅。但蒋贼仅有的几个机动兵力，已被迫分散，大部转为防御或“旅次行军”的部队了。蒋军由于兵力薄弱，士气低落，畏惧与解放军主力接战。据我军缴获之蒋贼申冬（九月二日）手令，“申斥”其部下“畏缩不前，上午七时以前、下午七时以后，不见我军继续前进，以此昼行夜息，形同旅次行军，何能歼灭共匪挽救危亡”？！陈诚申寒（九月十四日）代电中亦供称：“据战地视察组报告，一般部队缺乏旺盛精神，凡部队所到之地，即变为驻防性质，只知死守碉堡，不出动，不搜索，等待共‘匪’来攻，甚少争取主动寻‘匪’作战者”。这便是蒋军的写真。蒋匪整七十五师一部十七日曾侵占太和，二十三日当解放军进迫城郊，该敌即弃城而逃。连号称蒋匪五大主力之一的新五师（原第五军），亦龟缩许昌附近，不敢蠢动。解放军声势浩大，西迫郑州，东逼徐州，本月二十六日复一举攻克开封东南四十五里之陈留城，全歼守敌。开封蒋记官员惊恐万状。至于陇海路北鲁西南战场胜余之蒋军，先后遭到解放军歼灭打击后，原企图封锁黄河之整七十三师残部，东奔东平，整七二师残部回窜济宁，整八四师亦弃钜野东窜，整六八师残部则退守菏泽。现定（陶）城（武）单（县）曹（县）郓（城）鄄（城）广大地区，均告恢复。南北四百余里，东西一百八十余里以内无敌踪。整个鲁西南蒋军已转为防御。
    综观目前苏鲁豫皖战局，由于陈粟大军打到淮河，已于刘邓大军隔河呼应作战，蒋家匪帮在一片荒乱中将主力南调，可是蒋贼在关内只剩下新五师和整十一师两个精锐主力了，搬来搬去，要靠它看守平汉路、陇海路、津浦路等交通线，又要它看守郑州、许昌、开封、徐州、蚌埠等重要战略城市，又要它“旅次行军”，东援西救，结果不得不分散开来，便利解放军择肥而食。三个月前蒋贼以集中二、三十个整编师进攻沂鲁山区的那种凶势，已一去不复返了。苏鲁豫皖蒋军正面临逐一被歼灭的命运。蒋匪军永远没有可能来阻遏解放军春江怒潮似的强大攻势。
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫二十七日电】蒋匪对鲁西南区大施毁灭政策，杀掠惊人。陇海路北十余县仅八、九两月不完全统计，被抓壮丁至少四万五千以上，稍有抗拒当场即遭虐杀，曹县一区被杀者达二百人。蒋匪所过村庄，农舍残破，猪羊鸡鸭被吃光，树木被砍光，柴草被烧光，粮食被抢光，家俱农具全被捣毁，尸体、血迹、瓦砾、碎物等狼籍满地，惨不忍睹。砀山县北乡三十五村已成一片无人荒野。蒋匪整五师结合“还乡团”前次窜扰郓城一带，残暴甚于日寇“三光”政策。郓城某村六十余妇女无分老幼，遭该师一个营集体轮奸，蒋机轰炸扫射无日间断，黄河上民船时遭炸射，仅八月八日至十三日，即杀害及淹毙商人旅客达八百人。九月廿四日蒋匪八四师侵至郓城之罗楼渡口，竟将河上满载渡客的四只民船击沉，数百民商妇孺均死于枪弹及波涛之中，当地人民对暴行的答复是“坚决报仇”，该地区游击战争与爆炸运动，则更广泛展开。我各县县区干部提出“县不离县，区不离区”的口号。虽在极艰苦环境下亦不退出，领导群众坚持原地斗争。城武三区当各村均被占时，干部仍率领民兵伏于青纱帐与灌木丛中狙击敌人，捕捉散兵特务。干部韩富贵，曾于十日内俘匪二十一人。钜野某区书率领民兵奇袭匪警戒部队，三次俘二十八人。使企图回村复辟之“还乡团”不敢活动。各地并开展反掠夺反资敌运动，日前郓城伪六区下令每亩派银元二元，该命令由“还乡团”刘某携出交与沈桥村伪乡长李某，当夜我即将刘李二人逮捕，使伪区从此不敢出据点勒索。大反攻胜利消息，更提高该地区群众斗争胜利信心，他们说：“大河水小了，小河水就干了”。被抓壮丁乘我军反攻亦纷纷逃回，未逃出者则不断破坏匪军武器与瓦解其士气。
