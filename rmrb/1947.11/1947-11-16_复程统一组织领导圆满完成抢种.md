Enemy Comes, We Fight; Enemy Leaves, We Help Harvest

    [This Dispatch from JiLuYu on the 14th by Our Newspaper] The border area of Fucheng County, through unified organization, with cadres taking the lead and armed forces providing cover, has carried out a concentrated campaign to plant wheat, which has now been completed. After the county-wide cadre conference on October 10th, which proposed focusing on emergency wheat planting and eliminating wasteland as the central task, various districts separately studied and discussed the matter, formulating wheat planting plans. The second, fifth, seventh, and eighth districts launched competitions. After returning to their districts, they convened village cadre and farmer meetings, organizing mutual aid for wheat planting. Within three days, each village elected a wheat planting committee to unify the organization of livestock and labor. Livestock from different villages helped each other plow the land, and people helped each other pull the seed drills and spread fertilizer. Cadres all organized themselves into mutual aid teams, playing a leading role. For example, in a group led by Gao Shitian of Gaoqiao, others pulled five mu per half-day, while he pulled seven mu. He rose early and slept late, working three half-days a day when others worked two. The wheat planting in the third district was combined with joint defense and guarding homes. The sixth, ninth, and tenth districts in the border areas resolutely defended their positions with armed forces, launching struggles against the enemy to protect wheat planting. The ninth district fought four battles in three days, driving the enemy away and preventing them from entering the area, thus completing the task of protecting the entire county's wheat planting. By the 30th, the entire county had completed the emergency planting, with the planted area reaching 60% of the total land area. In previous years, the planted area was only 50%.
