　　Daming Sets Off an Enlistment Wave
  　Over a Hundred Hui Compatriots Sign Up
    [Report from our newspaper in Daming] The liberated peasant class in Daming city has raised its consciousness. Under the slogan of "Fight to Nanjing, capture Chiang Kai-shek alive," a wave of enthusiasm for joining the army is surging. Following the enlistment of 130 Hui people from Nanguan, another 206 people from various communities in the urban area have signed up to join the army. On November 16th, at 2:30 PM, the entire city held a meeting to collectively send them off. After the meeting, a parade of over 5,000 people took place, featuring "lion" dances and costumed Yangko performances, creating a very high-spirited atmosphere. (Wei Guang)
