【Report from Jinnan, November 13th by our newspaper】In Tiandilin Village, Zaoqiang Third District, the autumn land of middle peasants has been mostly cultivated, while the land of poor peasants has not been touched at all. The reason for this is that most of the village cadres are of middle-peasant origin and do not see the difficulties of the poor and hired peasants. Since the district deployed autumn plowing, the village cadres have not organized and promoted this work well, resulting in a spontaneous situation in autumn plowing. The poor peasant Zhang Zhiqi said: "The land of the middle peasants in our village has been plowed. Zhang Hengju, Zhang Zhimao, and others have sold their livestock after plowing their land. Some have even gone to fill in langwo (gullies eroded by water) after plowing their own land. The land of the poor is not plowed at all." The poor peasant Wang said: "My land is always planted after others have finished planting theirs. How can it grow well if it's late? This spring, I ran to two villages, but I couldn't borrow any livestock. So, my six mu and six fen of land only yielded five sorghum heads. Because of this, I dare not borrow from others again. It is no use to just stare if people are not willing to lend their livestock to us when they are idle." Wang Zhang said: "The one mu and eight fen of land in the northwest of our village cannot be reached by carts because there is water on the main road. The village made two cart tracks for us and promised to plow the land for us, but it has not been plowed yet. How can we plant it!" After the interviews, it was understood that the village head, the director of the Armed Committee, the instructor, the militia captain, the women's director and other village cadres were all of middle-peasant origin, and some were even well-to-do middle peasants. Although the chairman of the Peasants' Association is a poor middle peasant, he also has livestock, so he does not pay much attention to the difficulties of the poor peasants. The district leadership has now paid serious attention to this. Liu, the sub-secretary, said: "If this problem is not resolved, it will be a big problem when eliminating the spring famine, and it will increase the difficulty of combining future reviews with production." Now, all villages in the district have been immediately notified to launch a concentrated attack on this task, and specific instructions have been given to Tiandilin to stop selling livestock, concentrate all livestock to launch a concentrated attack, and emphasize solving the autumn plowing difficulties of poor peasants, ensuring it is completed before Little Snow (a term in the lunar calendar).

　　村干漠视贫雇困难
  　天地林贫农没牲口
    秋地一点都还没犁
    【本报冀南十三日电】枣强三区天地林村，中农秋地已大部耕完，而贫农土地一点没动。追其原因，村干多是中农成份，看不到贫雇的困难。该村自区布置秋耕后，村干没有很好组织与推动这一工作，因此秋耕形成自流现象。贫农张志起说：“俺村中农的地已耕完了。张恒举、张志茂等耕完了地已将牲口卖掉了。还有的耕完自己的地，又去垫浪窝（水冲的沟坑），穷人的地一点还没耕哩。”贫农王氏说：“俺那地老是人家种完俺才能种哩。晚了，怎么会长好？今春俺跑了两个村，都没借到牲口。所以俺那六亩六分地仅弄了五个高粱头。这样，俺也不敢再向人家借了。人家闲着牲口不借给咱，也是白瞪眼呀。”王张氏说：“俺村西北的一亩八分地，因大路上有水，不能行车，村里给俺轧了两条车道，光说给俺耕，到这也没耕，俺怎么种呢！”经访问后，才了解村长、武委会主任、指导员、民兵队长、妇女主任等村干部都是中农成份，还有的是富裕中农。农会主任虽是贫苦中农，也都有牲口，所以对贫农困难问题是不很注意的。现区领导上已提起严重注意，刘分书说：“此问题若得不到解决，消灭春荒时是个大问题，并增加将来复查结合生产的困难。”现已立即通知全区各村，突击这一任务，并具体指示天地林，停止卖牲口，集中一切牲口突击，强调解决贫农秋耕困难，小雪前一定耕完。
