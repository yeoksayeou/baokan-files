　　Xinjiang Conflict Continues
  　People's Army Recaptures Chenghua
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: According to Shanghai newspapers carrying Xinjiang news: The conflict between the Xinjiang Kuomintang reactionaries and the Xinjiang People's Autonomous Region continues. Chenghua, the capital of the Altai region of the People's Autonomous Region, which was forcibly occupied by the Kuomintang army on September 10th, was recaptured by the People's Autonomous Army on October 18th. The People's Autonomous Region currently possesses the Yining, Tacheng, and Altai regions, with a population of over 700,000, accounting for more than one-sixth of the total population of Xinjiang. It possesses a People's Autonomous Armed Force of 40,000 to 50,000, mostly excellent cavalry, who have been fighting for years against Kuomintang oppression and for autonomy. The peace terms signed in January 1946 between the Kuomintang authorities and the representatives of the Xinjiang People's Autonomous Region stated that the Kuomintang acknowledged this right to autonomy for the people of Xinjiang, but the Kuomintang authorities subsequently undermined these terms and conspired to extinguish the Xinjiang People's Autonomous movement. In May of this year, the Kuomintang authorities appointed Masud Sabri, a big Xinjiang landlord, feudal reactionary element, and Kuomintang Central Committee member, as the Chairman of Xinjiang, inciting opposition from the people of Xinjiang. Representatives of the Autonomous Region who had entered the Xinjiang provincial government based on the peace terms were also forced to withdraw. The Kuomintang authorities also concentrated 50,000 to 60,000 troops in southern Xinjiang and Dihua, preparing to attack the People's Autonomous Region. Chiang's troops and Kuomintang secret agents frequently captured and killed Hui people. The Chiang bandit warlords superficially allowed the people to carry out elections, but in reality, they arrested and imprisoned the people's candidates, forcing the people to vote for Chiang bandit puppets. Elected people's representatives were then arrested on fabricated charges. The people could no longer tolerate it and rose up to continue fighting for democracy and peace in Xinjiang.

　　新疆冲突仍持续中
  　人民军夺回承化
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】据上海报纸载新疆消息：新疆国民党反动派与新疆人民自治区之冲突仍在持续中。人民自治区阿山区首府承化于九月十日为国民党军强力侵占后，又为人民自治军于十月十八日将其夺回。人民自治区现拥有伊宁、塔城、阿山三区，人口七十余万，占全疆人口的六分之一强，拥有人民自治武装四五万人，其中多为优秀骑兵，彼等皆系为反对国民党压迫争取自治奋斗多年者。一九四六年一月国民党当局与新疆人民自治代表签订之和平条款，曾表示承认新疆人民此项自治权利，但国民党当局随后将此项条款加以破坏，并阴谋扑灭新疆人民自治运动。今年五月国民党当局委任新疆大财主封建反动分子国民党中委麦斯武德为新疆主席，激起全疆人民反对，根据和平条款进入新疆省府任职之自治区代表随之亦被迫撤退。国民党当局且将五、六万大军集中南疆和迪化，准备进攻人民自治区，蒋军和国民党特务经常捕杀回民，蒋匪军阀表面上让人民实行选举，实际却捕押人民的候选人，强迫人民投票选举蒋匪傀儡，人民代表当选者，又捏造罪名，加以逮捕。人民忍无可忍，乃奋起为新疆民主和平而继续奋斗。
