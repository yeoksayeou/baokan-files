Chiang Kai-shek Bandits Sabotage Jiangsu Dam Again
　　Our Government is Leading the Emergency Repair Efforts
　　[Report from this newspaper, Jilu豫, 8th] Just as we are tensely organizing wheat planting, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits are again attempting to sabotage the critical Jiangsu Dam. Liu Ruming, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit stationed in Heze, dispatched secret agents on the midnight of October 30th to cut more than ten crucial iron wires of the Jiangsu Dam at the Linpu Collection critical project in Juancheng. On October 31st, this area experienced a disaster; the inner mattress of the Third Dam was washed away by the flood. The revetment mattresses of the third, sixth, and seventh sections of the dam were completely washed away, and the dam foundation collapsed by three meters. The connecting mattresses of the third and fifth sections were also dislodged. If emergency repairs are not carried out, the Fourth Dam will also be washed away. After the alarm was raised, the Juancheng County people's armed forces immediately mobilized to strike at the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and provide cover for the repairs. At the same time, they rushed to transport large quantities of sorghum stalks, willow branches, hemp ropes, and other construction materials. The county magistrate and the head of the water conservancy section led the people of Juancheng to rush to the site for emergency repairs. In terms of technical guidance for the repairs, in addition to the engineering team from the Juancheng water conservancy section, there were also cadres from the engineering and materials sections of the Third Water Conservancy Bureau. The three engineering teams from Yuncheng and Pu counties also rushed to the site with large quantities of iron wires one after another. First, the dislodged inner mattress was tied around the waist with large hemp ropes to prevent it from being washed away, and then a large amount of straw and pressed soil was laid on top to stabilize the mattress. For the revetment mattress that had been washed away, the "pushing pillow" mattress laying method was used for emergency repairs. During the Yellow River flooding period, countless dangers occurred in various critical projects, but under the leadership of the democratic government and the masses overcoming all difficulties in the emergency repairs, the dangers were turned into safety. Now that the major flooding has passed, under the emergency repairs of the great mass strength in the liberated areas, we will surely smash the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' conspiracy and ensure the safety of the Jiangsu Dam.

    【本报冀鲁豫八日电】适值紧张组织种麦之际，蒋匪又图破坏江苏坝险工。驻菏泽之蒋匪刘汝明，曾先后派特务于十月三十日午夜，将我鄄城临濮集险工江苏坝之紧要铁丝割断十余根，该处于十月三十一日出险，第三坝里头埽被洪流冲掉，该坝第三第六第七段护沿埽全被冲跑，坝基坍塌达三公尺，第三、五段的接口埽均掉蛰，如不紧急抢修，则第四坝也将被冲掉。警报传出后，我鄄城县人民武装当即出动，打击蒋匪掩护抢修，一面赶运秫秸、柳枝、麻绠等大批工料，县长及修防段长等，星夜率领鄄城人民赶往抢修，在技术上领导抢修的，除了鄄城修防段的工程队外，并有第三修防处的工程科、材料科干部，郓（城）濮（县）三个工程队，也携带大批铁丝，先后赶往抢修。首先用大麻绠将掉蛰的里头埽拦腰束住，以免被冲跑，再从上面大量铺秸料及压土，使埽身着底稳固，对已被冲跑了的护沿埽则用“推枕”下埽法抢修，在黄河大泛期中，各险工出了无数的险，均在民主政府领导群众克服一切困难抢修之下，转险为安，今大泛已过，在解放区伟大的群众力量抢修之下，定能粉碎蒋匪之阴谋，而保住江苏坝的安全。
