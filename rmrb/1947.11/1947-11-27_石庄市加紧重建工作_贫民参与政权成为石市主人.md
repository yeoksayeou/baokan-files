Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀 [Jin-Cha-Ji, i.e. Jin察冀 Border Region] 25th Dispatch: Our correspondent Yang Shuo reports: The restoration and reconstruction of Shijiazhuang City are being accelerated. The democratic municipal government has already begun to open granaries to provide relief to the poor and has entrusted the Jin察冀 Trade Bureau to transport 1.2 million jin of grain, 100,000 jin of oil, and 300,000 jin of salt from Ji Central and Ji West to supply the people's food. The Baojia system, by which Chiang Kai-shek's bandits ruled the people of Shijiazhuang, has also been gradually destroyed, and district and street public offices have been established one after another. Urban poor, workers, small merchants, and women, who were exploited in the era of bandits and puppets, have actively participated in the government and become masters of Shijiazhuang. Peasants in the Huayuan Street area of the city have also voluntarily formed a poor peasant association to lead the masses in liberation. The railway workers' union, with over 10,000 workers, has also been formally established. Workers in various industries have voluntarily organized armed pickets to protect railways and factories. Chiang Kai-shek's bandits have been dispatching American-style Chiang Kai-shek airplanes to indiscriminately bomb and strafe innocent residents of the city every day since the 12th. This atrocity had not stopped as of the 18th. The masses are all extremely indignant at this; under the leadership of the democratic government, the entire city's people have been universally organized and have risen up to carry out various rescue and protection efforts. A few days ago, the Daxing Yarn Factory was bombed and set on fire by Chiang Kai-shek's planes, and all the workers of the factory voluntarily put out the fire, protecting the factory that had been transferred from the hands of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits to their own. The local newspaper was also launched on the 18th of this month.

　　石庄市加紧重建工作
  　贫民参与政权成为石市主人
    【新华社晋察冀二十五日电】本社记者杨朔报导：石家庄市恢复与重建工作，正加紧进行中。民主市政府已进行开仓济贫，并委托晋察冀贸易局自冀中、冀西等地运来粮食一百二十万斤，油十万斤，盐三十万斤供应民食。蒋匪在石市统治人民的保甲制，也已被逐渐摧毁，并先后成立了各区、街公所。匪伪时代备遭压榨的城市贫民、工人、小商人及妇女纷纷参与政权，成为石市主人。市内花园街一带农民，并已自动组成贫农会，领导群众翻身。拥有万余工人的铁路工会，亦正式成立。各业工人并自动组织武装纠察队，保护铁路、工厂。蒋贼于十二日起曾逐日派出美式蒋机向该市无辜居民滥施轰炸扫射，此一暴行迄十八日仍未停止。群众对此无不愤慨万分；在民主政府领导下，全市民众已普遍组织起来，奋起进行各种急救与防护工作。日前大兴纱厂遭蒋机轰炸起火，该厂全体工人即自动奋力将火扑灭，保卫了由蒋匪手中转为自己所有的工厂。当地报纸亦已于本月十八日创刊。
