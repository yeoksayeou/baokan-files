(Our Newspaper, Taiyue, 9th dispatch) The Jiexiu grain protection campaign, spearheaded by the Zhang Ximan combat team, has achieved remarkable results, making it so that the enemy must shed a drop of blood for every grain they steal. The guerrilla forces and militia in the border areas of Jiexiu have always been brave and strong in their struggle against the enemy. The autumn grain protection campaign has been even more active. In the eight days from October 18th to 25th alone, there were six major battles, resulting in 34 enemy casualties, the recovery of 1,900 catties of grain, six livestock, and a whole cart of clothing and cotton. Of particular note were the combination of landmines and rifles by the Zhang Ximan combat team on the 25th and the two battles fought by the Sanhu Company on the 21st. On the 21st, the 218th Regiment of the enemy's 73rd Division, in coordination with a unit of the "Struggle Corps," attempted to encircle and attack our Shangxia Liang Village at dawn. At this time, the Zhang Ximan combat team and the Sanhu Company rushed to the scene and engaged the enemy in a fierce battle, killing two enemies and wounding three on the spot, driving back the enemy, and recovering six livestock belonging to the masses. After breakfast, the Zhang Lan enemy police brigade, led by bandit leader Hu Yiwu, etc., divided its forces into two routes and retaliated against our Shangliang Village from Xialiang Village. The Sanhu Company rushed to the scene upon hearing the gunfire and joined the battle again. The enemy launched three assaults, all of which were repelled. On the 25th, a battalion of the 218th Regiment of the enemy's 73rd Division in Hongshan, again in coordination with the rural "Struggle Corps," once again robbed our Shangliang Village of grain. The Zhang Ximan combat team used "returning horse thunder" for the second time. The mines had been buried in the village beforehand. When the enemy entered the village, one was killed when they triggered a mine at Hong Yi's house. Upon entering the home of hero Zhang Ximan, two enemies were killed by a "open door" mine. Another group of enemies entered Bao Hongyuan's house and stepped into a minefield, causing the brains of two enemies to burst open. Then, the mine at Wang Hongying's house was also triggered by the enemy, killing one. This caused the enemy to panic, with no way to advance or retreat. At this time, the Zhang Ximan combat team, which was ambushed outside the village, and the militia of the Qiangyu, Shangliang, Goukou, and Goudi honeybee joint defense areas rushed to the scene, organized firepower, and launched a counterattack into the village. Li Shuhua killed two enemies with a burst from his machine gun. The enemy was unable to hold out and collapsed backwards. All the militia members were invigorated and pursued the victory. They encountered the enemy's rural "Struggle Corps" robbing grain in Jianli Village and launched another fierce battle, wounding two enemies and recovering ten shih of grain, three sheep, clothing, and a whole cart of cotton. A total of ten enemies were killed or wounded in the battle that day. After this battle, the enemy quickly withdrew from the Xialiang stronghold they had forcibly established on the 21st.

(Our Newspaper, Taiyue, 9th dispatch) A certain battalion of the Pingyao Independent Regiment, newly organized by liberated peasants, achieved victory in its first campaign. A certain newly established battalion of the Pingyao Independent Regiment went deep behind enemy lines and, on the 28th, unexpectedly defeated the Yan bandit Struggle Corps stationed in Xicuiyao, wounding more than ten enemies and capturing a light machine gun. They then rushed to Dongquan overnight to ambush. On the morning of the 29th, over a hundred members of the Xiquan "Struggle Corps" set out to rob grain from Dongquan. As soon as they entered the village, they were attacked from the front and rear, wounding more than twenty enemies and capturing a light machine gun and a rifle. That afternoon, when our army returned, the masses along the way praised this new army.
