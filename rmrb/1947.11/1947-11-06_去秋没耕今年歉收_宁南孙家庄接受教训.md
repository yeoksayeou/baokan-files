    Failure to Plow Last Autumn Leads to Poor Harvest This Year
    Sunjia Village, Ningnan, Learns a Lesson
    [Our newspaper, Jinan, 4th dispatch] Sunjia Village in Ningnan has learned a lesson from this year's poor harvest and is organizing manpower and animal power to launch a winter plowing campaign. The village farmers' association recently held a general meeting of all members, reporting their autumn harvest yields and reviewing the main reason for this year's poor autumn harvest: the land was not plowed well. Last autumn, poor people had no livestock and could not turn the soil, so it was all pulled by human mutual aid this spring, plowed too shallow, and the harvest was very small. If we want to increase production next year, we must plow the land well after autumn. Some said: "This year we have turned over, we have livestock, and we have food, so we should plow the land well." Therefore, it was decided to organize all the livestock to plow the land together, and not use livestock for milling rice or grinding flour, and first plow the land of the families of the resistance and stretcher teams before plowing their own. The whole village has seven cows and two donkeys, and eight hundred mu of autumn land. Calculating at four mu per head of livestock per day, it can be plowed in twenty days. Work began on the 23rd of last month.
    [Our newspaper, Jinan, 4th dispatch] The Jize County Committee summarized the wheat planting achievements and deployed winter plowing to eliminate barren land. According to the instructions of the District Committee "to support the great counter-offensive and expand the wheat planting area" and the understanding of the wheat planting situation in various districts, the County Committee decided to seize another ten days with a blitz spirit. It called on county and district cadres to cooperate with village cadres to check wheat planting plans group by group and household by household. Organize all manpower and animal power, implement work exchanges, labor swaps, and hiring labor to overcome various wheat planting difficulties (with special emphasis on organizing manpower, so as to free up livestock to plow wheat land), to achieve the requirement of three mu of wheat per person. For winter plowing work, we must first educate the masses with the proverbs "Scratching the skin after autumn is better than plowing it next year" and "The old hen stomps a foot after autumn, and the hoe will follow next year", and strive to eliminate barren land before November 10th; each district and village should conduct periodic inspections and summaries.

    去秋没耕今年歉收
    宁南孙家庄接受教训
    【本报冀南四日电】宁南孙家庄接受今年歉收教训，组织人畜力突击冬耕。该村农会日前召开全体会员大会，自报今年秋收产量，并检讨出今年秋收不好的主要原因是地耕的不好。去秋穷人没牲口，不能翻地，全是今春人力互助拉的，犁的太浅，收成很少。要想明年增加产量，必须秋后把地犁好。有的说：“今年咱翻身了，有了牲口，又有饭吃，可该把地翻好。”遂决定所有牲口一齐组织起来犁地，碾米、磨面不用牲口，并先将抗属及担架队家属的地犁完再犁自己的。全村共有牛七头、驴两头、秋地八百亩，按一头牲口每天犁四亩计，二十天即可翻完。上月二十三日即开始动工。
    【本报冀南四日电】鸡泽县委会总结种麦成绩，布置冬耕消灭白地。县委会根据地委“为支援大反攻扩大种麦面积”的指示及对各区种麦情况的了解，确定以突击精神，再抢种十天。号召县、区干部协同村干，挨组、挨户检查种麦计划。组织所有人力畜力，实行变工、换工、雇工，克服各种种麦困难（特别着重在组织人力上，以便抽出牲口犁麦地），达到每人三亩麦的要求。对冬耕工作首须以“秋后划破皮，强似明年犁一犁”、“秋后老鸡蹬一脚，照着来年镢一镢”的农谚教育群众，并争取在十一月十日前消灭白地；各区村按期检查总结。
