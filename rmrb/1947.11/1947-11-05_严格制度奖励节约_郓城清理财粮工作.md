(Via this paper's correspondent in the Ji-Lu-Yu region, 2nd) Yuncheng is carrying out financial and grain clearing work, clarifying responsibilities and strictly implementing systems to overcome the chaotic financial situation. The county has been in an environment of large-scale battles and tug-of-war for the past year, which has made the finances of districts and villages very chaotic. Nobody in the county, district, or village knows the actual financial situation. When asking for military grain, it became a case of "whipping the fast ox." Villages where cadres worked seriously and had a good foundation suffered from contributing more public grain. For example, last autumn, the public grain was calculated at 15 jin per mu, and the entire village of X Tun in the Sixth District should have contributed 2,777 jin, but actually expended 4,789 jin and 2 liang, an over expenditure of 2,012 jin and 2 liang. Villages with poor work foundation and slippery village cadres contributed less grain and benefited. For example, the entire village of X Hai should have contributed 29,057 jin, but only expended 872 jin and 7 liang. The same was true for the wheat season public grain this year. Cadres and the masses are urgently requesting to resolve the unreasonable phenomena of grain expenditure. County and district cadres seized the current gap and persisted in completing the district and village financial clearing work, and everyone grasped the actual financial situation. The Fourth District suffered severely from enemy disasters. In early September this year, during the Fifth Army of Chiang Kai-shek's one-time stationing, the district lost more than 58,000 jin of wheat, more than 300,000 jin of sorghum, more than 40,000 jin of millet, as well as beans, white flour, black flour, firewood, sesame, etc. The enemy shot four people, artillery shells killed a total of 35 men and women, and 78 people were seriously injured. They took away 230 large carts and 4 small carts, captured 752 people, and robbed 503 head of cattle, donkeys, horses, and mules, as well as silver, local currency, clothing, and other items. After the government understood the significant losses of the masses, it decided not to deliver the owed 140,000 jin of wheat, and handed it over to the district for adjustment, and reduced and exempted 180,000 jin in this autumn's public grain. In terms of the method of clearing work, some districts adopted the method of separating from the district headquarters and doing the clearing separately, and adopted the village-district reporting method. The village reported to the district once a day, handing over the slip for how much public grain was issued that day. The district reported to the county once every three days. In this way, districts and villages, counties and districts, were able to understand each other's situation, so as to rationally deploy grain numbers and make appropriate adjustments. In addition, whenever our large army arrived, the county headquarters sent people to find the supply departments of the troops, took the initiative to contact them, determine how much supplies were needed, appropriately divided the area, arranged the numbers, and stipulated which district was responsible for supplying which unit. This solved the difficulties of the troops, and at the same time, the county headquarters had a planned grasp of the figures of grain expenditure in each district, making the burdens of each district balanced and reasonable. In the village clearing, many IOUs were found. Most of the people who issued IOUs were cadres and comrades above the district level. They did not take grain coupons after eating in the village, and casually gave the village cadres an IOU. Some of the IOUs stated that they ate noodles and sesame cakes. The Sixth District implemented the method of having whoever ate the food be responsible for returning the grain coupons or money. On the 14th, the county held a meeting of financial cadres in the county. In addition to summarizing the past cleaning work, rewarding Xu Xueli and other four district financial cleaning models, and criticizing and punishing Wang Qinghai and other three district industrial and commercial cadres; it also put forward the following suggestions for future work: "The county should always have a solid understanding of the financial situation of the districts and villages, strictly implement systems, practice thrift, and actively support the great counter-offensive." After the district and village clearing work, cadres and the masses had a solid understanding of how much was owed and how much was saved, and no longer felt the difficulty of a chaotic financial situation that could not be dealt with.

    严格制度奖励节约
    郓城清理财粮工作
    【本报冀鲁豫二日电】郓城进行清理财粮工作，明确责任严格制度，克服了财经紊乱现象。该县在一年来大战场大拉锯的环境下，使得区村财经非常紊乱，县对区，区对村的财经谁也不摸实底。在要军粮时形成“鞭打快牛”，村干工作认真工作基础较好的村子，出公粮多吃亏大。如去年秋季公粮每亩地按十五斤算，六区×屯全村应出公粮二千七百七十七斤，但却支出了四千七百八十九斤二两，超支了二千零十二斤二两。工作基础差，村干滑头的村子，出粮少倒占便宜。如在×海全村，应出粮二万九千零五十七斤，只支出了八百七十二斤七两，今年麦季公粮也是如此。对以上出粮的不合理的现象，干部群众都迫切要求清理解决，县区干部抓紧了现在空隙，坚持完成了区村财经清理工作，大家摸到了财经情况的实际。四区受敌灾严重，该区于今年九月初蒋五军一次的驻扎中，共损失了麦子五万八千余斤，高粱三十万余斤，谷子四万余斤，还有豆子、白面、黑面、柴草、芝麻等，敌人枪毙了群众四人，炮弹炸死者男女共三十五名，受重伤者七十八名，拉走大车二百卅辆、小车四辆，抓走七百五十二口人，抢牛、驴、马、骡五百零三头，还有白银、本币衣物等甚多。政府了解了群众之重大损失后，就将所欠之十四万斤麦子不再上解，交区调剂，并于今年秋季公粮中减免十八万斤。在清理工作的方法上，有的区采用了与区指挥部分开单独做清理的方法，并采用村区汇报办法，村里每天向区汇报一次，交出这一天出了多少公粮的条子，区里三天向县汇报一次。这样使得区对村、县对区彼此互相摸底，以合理的布置粮数和适当的调剂。另外，每逢我大军到来时，县指挥部即派人去找部队供给部门，主动取联系，需用多少给养，适当划分区域，布置数目，规定好那个区负责供给那个单位。这样一方面解决了部队的困难，同时县指挥部有计划的掌握了各区支出粮的数字，使得各区负担平衡合理。在村的清理上，弄出来很多白条子，开条子的人多是区以上的干部同志，他们在村吃饭后不拿粮票，随便开一个白条给了村干，条子上有的写着吃的挂面烧饼，这些条子的处理，在六区实行了谁吃的就把条子交谁负责归还粮票，或钱的办法。十四日，县里开全县财经干部会，除总结过去一段清理工作，奖励区财清理模范许学礼等四人，批评处分了区工商干事王清海等三人外；并对今后工作提出：“县对区、区对村的财经情况，应经常摸实底，严格制度，厉行节约，积极支援大反攻”。经过了区村清理工作，干部群众欠多少存多少都摸到了实底，不再感到财经紊乱没法办的困难。
