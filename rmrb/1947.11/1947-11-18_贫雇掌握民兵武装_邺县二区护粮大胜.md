　　Poor and Hired Peasants Control Militia Armed Forces
  　Yexian Second District Achieves Great Victory in Protecting Grain
    [This newspaper, Taihang, 16th dispatch] The Yexian Second District militia has achieved another great victory in protecting grain and manpower. At dawn on the 2nd of this month, the puppet Cixian County security team and more than 400 people from three township governments attempted to encircle our district office. From Zhangjia Village in the south to Donggaoxue in the north, the militia fought the enemy in separate villages along an eight-mile front. After two hours of valiant fighting, they routed the enemy, killing six and wounding twelve. All the clothing and items that were robbed were recovered. The masses said happily, "They fought fiercely enough." In summarizing the battle results, the district pointed out that the reasons for achieving the above results were: the militia armed forces were truly controlled by poor and hired peasants (of which 91% were poor and hired peasants, and 9% were middle peasants), and that they went deep behind enemy lines to capture traitors and local bullies, carried out explosions behind enemy lines, and established mass-based intelligence. For example, two old men from Xinzhuang were forced by the enemy to scout the situation, and they took the opportunity to report to our Liu Guozhi's armed work team, driving the enemy away. Furthermore, the Yexian Brigade summarized the results of the autumn protection campaign in October: 38 battles were fought, killing and wounding more than 140 enemies, capturing one machine gun, eight rifles, four pistols, and more than 800 rounds of ammunition. During the autumn harvest, they launched political offensives, wrote slogans, held mass meetings, and mobilized puppet family members. They also helped to harvest 26 mu of grain, thresh more than ten times, and plow more than ten mu of land. In addition, they helped carry water and grind flour, which was very popular with the masses.

　　贫雇掌握民兵武装
  　邺县二区护粮大胜
    【本报太行十六日电】邺县二区民兵保粮、保丁又获大胜。本月二日拂晓，伪磁县保安队及三个乡公所四百余人，企图包围我区署，南起张家庄，北至东高穴，八里长战线上，民兵分村迎敌，奋战两小时，将敌击溃，计毙敌六名，伤敌十二名，被抢衣物全部夺回。群众高兴的说：“打得真够劲”。该区在总结战绩时，指出：获得上述成绩原因是：民兵武装真正为贫雇掌握（其中百分之九十一是贫雇农，百分之九是中农），以及深入敌后捕捉奸霸，开展敌后爆炸，建立群众性的情报，如辛庄两老汉被敌强迫探情况，他们乘势报告给我刘国治武工队，将敌赶跑。又：邺县大队总结十月份保秋战绩：作战三十八次，毙伤敌百四十余名，缴获机枪一挺，步枪八支，手枪四支，子弹八百余发。秋收中展开政攻、写标语、开群众会、伪属会，并帮助割谷二十六亩、打场十余次、耕地十余亩。此外又帮助担水、推磨等，极受群众欢迎。
