　　Che Yuan Plan: Three Jin of Winter Spinning Per Person Per Month
    [Our Newspaper, Licheng News] In Che Yuan Village, Fifth District, textile heroine Guo Chunmei, from January to September this year (lunar calendar), in addition to weaving nine bolts of cloth and providing clothing for her family (five people, large and small), helped two relatives weave eleven zhang of cloth. Furthermore, she earned over 30,000 yuan by spinning and weaving. Under her promotion, 152 women in the village were organized, voluntarily forming thirteen groups. After nine months of spinning and weaving, great progress has been made. Skilled workers have improved the quality, semi-skilled workers have also made great progress, and new learners like Li Zhuqing and 45 others have become skilled spinners. Spinning and weaving are exchanged for labor in production: weaving seven chi of cloth is equivalent to one work day, spinning five liang of cotton is equivalent to one work day, weaving one chi of cloth is worth 60 yuan. Spinning and weaving do not interfere with production. Statistics show that from January to September, the entire village spun 3,370 jin of cotton and wove 2,359 zhang of cloth. The entire village of 756 people requires an average of two zhang of cloth per person, totaling 1,512 zhang. The remaining 847 zhang can be sold to buy 84 shi of millet. This winter, the plan is for each female spinner to complete three jin of finished products (woven from cotton into cloth) per month, and to further improve the quality for sale.

    [Our Newspaper, Xingtai News] The Tenth District held a meeting of textile teachers and learning models on the 27th day of the ninth lunar month to summarize the textile work of the past six months and promote the winter textile movement. There are 34 administrative villages in the district, with a total of 4,533 women, of which 2,198 are engaged in weaving and spinning. There were 454 skilled weavers last year, and 943 have been added this year; there were 365 semi-skilled workers, and 898 have been added this year. A total of 34,740 jin of cloth were woven and 66,450 jin of yarn were spun. When exchanging experiences, Yao Sini, chairman of the Women's Rescue Association of Fangjiapu, said: "To lead textile work, we must first promote democracy, cadres must be patient and practical, and we must also seize the opportunity to cultivate typical examples among the poor and hired laborers. It is not enough for a village to rely solely on one textile teacher and cadre." Zhang Xiurong from Beiyehe said: "To lead textile work, we must also understand the psychology of the weavers and their families. Dividends should be distributed frequently, with a 3-7 split (weavers receive 30% and the family receives 70%), so that the family will free up more time for weaving." After exchanging experiences and summarizing achievements, when proposing the winter textile tasks, it was suggested that skilled weavers should improve their techniques, and 1,300 semi-skilled workers should become skilled within three months of winter. All women in the district between the ages of fifteen and forty-five are required to learn to be semi-skilled. This winter, 77,500 jin of cloth must be woven in three months, ensuring that it can be sold. (Wei Ling, Jing Yi)

　　车元计划冬纺每人一月三斤
    【本报黎城讯】五区车元村，纺织英雄郭春梅，今年一至九月份（阴历），除织布九匹，全家穿衣外（大小五口）帮助二家亲戚织布十一丈，另外纺花织布赚洋三万余元。在他推动下，全村妇女组织起来一五二人，自愿结合十三个小组，经九个月的纺织，大有进步，全把式质量提高，半把式也有很大进步，新学手有李竹青等四十五人，已成了纺线能手。纺织与生产变工，织七尺布顶一工，纺五两花顶一工，织一尺布六十元，纺织生产两不误。统计全村一至九月，纺花三千三百七十斤，织布二千三百五十九丈，全村七五六人，每人平均二丈布，共需一千五百一十二丈，剩余八四七丈出卖可买小米八十四石。今冬计划每个纺妇一月要完成三斤成品（由花织成布），并在质量上提高一步，以便出卖。（岱云、汝厚、子珍、振华）
    【本报邢台讯】十区在旧历九月二十七日，召开全区纺织老师和学习模范会议总结半年来纺织工作，推动展开冬季纺织运动。全区共三十四个行政村，共妇女四千五百三十三个，织纺妇女二千一百九十八个，去年原有织布成手四百五十四个，今年增加成手九百四十三个；原有半手三百六十五个，今年新增八百九十八个；共织布三万四千七百四十斤，纺线六万六千四百五十斤。交流经验时放甲铺妇救会主席姚四妮说：“领导纺织首先得发扬民主，干部必须耐心实干，还得抓住贫雇培养典型，一个村光凭一个纺织老师和干部是不行的。”北野河张秀荣说：“领导纺织还得摸住织手和家长的心理，妇女给家庭分红要勤分，三七分红（织手三家得七）这样家里便给腾出时间多织布。”经过交流经验和总结成绩后，提出今冬纺织任务时，成手织布要提高技术，一千三百个半成手冬三月要变成手。要求全区妇女十五岁至四十五的妇女，都学会半成手。今冬三月要织出七万七千五百斤，保证卖出去。（维伶、景义）
