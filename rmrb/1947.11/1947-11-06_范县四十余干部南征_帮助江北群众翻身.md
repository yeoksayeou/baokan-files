    Over Forty Cadres from Fan County March South
    To Help People in Jiangbei Overturn Their Lives
    [Report from this newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, 4th] Cadres and people in Fan County warmly send off the cadres going south to help the masses in the new area overturn their lives. When the news of the southward march reached the county, cadres in various districts eagerly signed up. After Comrade Zhao, the secretary of the Fourth District, took the lead in signing up at the cadre meeting, everyone signed up. In order not to affect local work, only four comrades were finally selected to go, and those who were not allowed showed their displeasure. Gao Zhuang, the head of the peasant association in the Third District, was 47 years old, but he insisted on going south. In the end, a total of 43 cadres were selected to march south. On the 25th, the county committee held a grand send-off meeting. The venue was plastered with colorful slogans such as "Mobilize the poor people in Jiangbei to overturn their lives" and "Liberate the people of Jiangbei from the rule of the bandit Chiang". The cadres marching south were full of vigor, and the comrades who could not go expressed their admiration and envy for them. The county committee presented each cadre marching south with items such as towels on the spot as a glorious gift to the cadres marching south to serve the people. The comrades marching south also expressed their determination to overcome all difficulties and help the masses under the rule of the bandit Chiang to be liberated. The masses at the residence of the county committee were overjoyed when they heard that our cadres were going south to establish a liberated area, and immediately set up a stage to perform a play to send them off. An old woman said happily: "When our cadres go there, the people there will also get to overturn their lives!" When they were about to leave, the cadres and masses who remained behind sent them off with drums and gongs outside the village.

    【本报冀鲁豫四日电】范县干部群众，热烈欢送南下干部帮助新区群众翻身。当南下的消息传到该县后，各区的干部都纷纷报名要求南下。四区分书赵同志，在干部会议上带头报名后，大家都报了名，为了不影响本地工作，最后只确定四个同志去时，未得到允许的，表现了不高兴。三区高庄农会长四十七岁了，也一定要南下。最后共确定了四十三名干部南征。二十五日，县委会举行隆重的欢送会，会场上贴满“要发动江北穷人翻身”“使江北人民，在蒋匪的统治下解放出来”等彩色标语，南下干部精神焕发，不能去的同志，对他们表现了钦佩与羡慕。县委会当场赠送南下干部每人手巾等物，作为光荣的为人民服务的南征干部献礼。南下同志也表示一定要克服一切困难，帮助蒋匪统治下的群众得到解放。县委会驻地群众听见我们的干部到南边建立解放区后，个个都欢天喜地，并马上搭台子演剧欢送。一个老大娘高兴的说：“咱这边干部一去，那边老百姓也得到翻身啦！”临行时，留下的干部群众，锣鼓喧天的欢送他们到村外。
