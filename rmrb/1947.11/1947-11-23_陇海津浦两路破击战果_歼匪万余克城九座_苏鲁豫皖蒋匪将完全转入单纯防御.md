　　Xinhua News Agency, Front Lines of Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui, 21st: The Front Headquarters has just released Communiqué No. 28, announcing the results of the Longhai Railway breaching operation as follows: (1) Our army's breaching operation along the 500-li section of the Longhai Railway between Xuzhou and Lanfeng began on the morning of November 9th and successfully concluded on the night of the 18th. Of the 500-li railway line controlled by our army in this campaign, 250 li from Haozhai in the east to Tianzhuang (east of Zhuji) in the west, and 130 li from Xiaoba (west of Zhuji) to Quantou (east of Lanfeng), totaling 380 li, have been thoroughly destroyed. At the same time, over 30 li of the Jinpu Railway were destroyed between Xuzhou and Guzhen, destroying more than ten iron bridges. Currently, the enemy forces on the Pinghan and Jinpu lines have been completely separated by us, forcing the enemy in the Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui battlefields to completely revert to a purely defensive posture. (2) The elimination of the headquarters of the 7th Brigade of Chiang Kai-shek's Provisional 24th Division and the 1st and 2nd Regiments (missing one battalion) of that brigade, the headquarters of the 2nd Regiment and its entire 2nd Battalion and two companies of the 6th Brigade. The entire Jiangsu Provincial Security First Regiment (formerly misreported as the 11th Regiment), and the entire security regiments of Dangshan, Yucheng, and Shanxian counties, a military police squad, and a decommissioned officer team. The defeat of three brigades of the reorganized 5th Division and three brigades of the 68th Division, with the capture of 7,739 officers and soldiers including Major General Ding Baoren, Brigade Commander of the 7th Brigade of the Provisional 24th Division, and the killing or wounding of 3,300 men from units such as the Reorganized 5th Division. (3) The capture of nine county towns: Dangshan, Yucheng, Xiayi, Minquan, Xiaoxian, Juye, Jiaxiang, Peixian, and Yutai, and thirteen stations along the Longhai Railway: Yanglou, Huangkou, Dangshan, Lizhuang, Xiaoyangji, Liudi Quan, Mamuji, Zhangge, Liuhe, Liba, Yejigang, Neihuang, Quantou, etc., as well as strongholds such as Liukou Town, Dingji Town, Guzhai, Shixinzhuang, Sun Liukou, Liuheji, and Mamuji, and four stations on the Jinpu Railway: Sanbu (south of Xuzhou), Fuliji, Lizhuang, and Renqiao. (4) The seizure of 39 field guns, mountain guns, and mortars, 242 light and heavy machine guns, 22 submachine guns, 3,378 rifles and pistols, over 300,000 rounds of ammunition, over 1,000 artillery shells, 3 trucks, 12 locomotives, 305 carriages, one armored train, two armored vehicles, 2 million catties of military grain, and a portion of other military supplies. The destruction of two tanks, nine trucks, the demolition of over 5,000 telephone poles, approximately 180,000 railway sleepers, and the excavation and destruction of 200 li of roadbed (the results of the capture of Yutai are not included in the statistics).
　　Xinhua News Agency, Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui, 21st: The Liberation Army captured Yutai County in southwestern Shandong at 1:00 AM on the 19th, completely annihilating the defending enemy. The results of the battle are currently being tallied. Another unit of our army advanced on Peixian City northwest of Xuzhou on the evening of the 18th. The defending enemy fled, and the city was liberated by us.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Front Lines of Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui, 21st: Frontline reporters report that after all Chiang Kai-shek bandit strongholds along the Xuzhou-Lanfeng section of the Longhai Railway were surrounded or captured by the Liberation Army, more than 50,000 liberated peasants in road-breaking teams surged onto the Longhai Railway like a raging tide. The scene was filled with people. Iron rakes struck stone and steel rails, the sounds carrying for miles. The peasants were extremely excited, calling the excavation of the roadbed "digging up Chiang's roots" and the removal of railway tracks "pulling up Chiang's roots," and a "digging up Chiang's roots" competition was launched. Zhang Qingjia, chairman of the Zhanglou Farmers' Association in the Second District of Chengwu County, told reporters that when they heard about destroying the railway, everyone rushed to come. A thousand people came from his district. Zhang Qingjia led a team that was the first to break more than four li of road about four li away from Liudi Quan Station, braving enemy artillery fire. Inspired by the slogan "Turn over and protect the fields, dig up Chiang's roots," hundreds of miles of railway embankments were quickly destroyed. Piles of sleepers were burning fiercely. The flames illuminated the sky far and wide. Looking at the railway line from a distance, it resembled a fiery dragon, and laughter never ceased.
