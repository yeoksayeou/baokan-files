　　Shouyang First District Armed Grain Protection Team
    Successfully Completes Grain Protection Mission
    [Reported from Taihang on the 14th by this newspaper] The Taihang Second Military Sub-district Military Commission commended the Shouyang First District Armed Grain Protection Team in a circular issued at the end of October. This district's grain protection team brought into play the operational policy of "one hand holding a gun, the other holding a shovel," and under the combat slogan of "enemy attacks are repelled, assistance is provided after the enemy leaves," successfully completed the tasks of harvesting, threshing, and storing grain within six days from the 18th to the 23rd of last month. They also crushed the Yan bandit's plan to establish strongholds at Mashou and Longhua Mountain to seize grain, assisting in the harvesting of over 300 mu of land, the threshing of over 600 shi of grain, and the protection of the harvesting of over 3,000 mu of land in six villages including Yinzhao. They also captured nine Yan bandits, including a "Rolling Team" captain, killed or wounded 58 bandits, seized nine head of livestock, over 20 carts, and four hand grenades. At the beginning of last month, the Yan bandits concentrated three divisions of troops in northern Shouyang and Meng County to seize grain on a large scale and attempted to conscript men in southern Shouyang. The district then organized over 180 militiamen from nine villages, including Yujiamiao, into an armed grain protection team. Led by District Chief Liu Guomo, they went to the railway side to protect the harvesting of over ten villages, including Longjiazhai. On the 18th, they protected and helped the villages of Longjiazhai, etc., harvest over 120 mu of millet and beans and thresh 38 shi; on the 19th, they repelled an invasion by over 300 troops from the Yan bandit's 49th Division, killing or wounding 11, rescuing over 300 people from villages such as Yanjiazhuang, and helping local people harvest over 80 mu of millet and thresh 125 shi, with no losses to the masses. On the 23rd, over 1,000 Yan bandits, carrying two heavy machine guns and over 20 small cannons, advanced towards Mashou, Xinao, and Feicun in three routes. Our grain protection team also divided into routes to defend the mountains, bravely repelling three enemy charges. The enemy finally concentrated their forces to charge the Second Company, which was defending Xinao and Qianliang. The First Company cooperated with the Second Company, quickly maneuvering to deploy firepower and flanking them from both sides, finally repelling the bandits, killing 15 and wounding 32. We only sacrificed one person and two were slightly injured, with no losses to the masses in the Mashou area. The grain protection team also advanced north of the road, protecting the transfer of people from five villages, including Sanhe and Yinzhao, south of the road to harvest over 1,800 mu of land. On the 22nd, they went directly into the bandit "model" village of Lijia Gou, struggling against four landlord households for over 40 shi of grain and over 100 pieces of clothing, returning them to the masses. Another route took the initiative to attack Guocun, capturing the "Rolling Team" captain and seven others, and seizing over 20 carts. The masses seized the opportunity and harvested over 1,000 mu in one day. When the team summarized its achievements on the 26th, the masses came to offer their condolences. The masses north of the road were even more grateful, sending plows, fruits, pork, mutton, cabbage, millet, etc., receiving so much they could not take it all. The Fourth District north of the road also wrote a letter to express their condolences.
