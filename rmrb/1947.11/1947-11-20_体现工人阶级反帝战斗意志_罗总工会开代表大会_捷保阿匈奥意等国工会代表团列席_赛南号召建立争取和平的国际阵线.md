Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: Bucharest dispatch: The Romanian General Confederation of Labor convened its Second Representative Congress on the 11th and victoriously concluded on the 15th after electing a new leadership organ of over ninety people. Attending the meeting were delegations from the trade unions of Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Albania, Hungary, Austria, and Italy. World Federation of Trade Unions General Secretary Saillant addressed the meeting, praising the Soviet Union as a "true fighter for peace, democracy, and freedom for the working people." He pointed out: "International capitalism is launching the most violent attacks on the Soviet Union because they believe that any weakening of the Soviet Union will help them hinder the solidarity of the international working class." Saillant called on the working class to "establish a great international front to fight for peace." Saillant praised "Romanian history has begun a new century. The Romanian people, who were enslaved not long ago and unable to express their just wishes and reasonable demands, can now carry out a united and well-organized trade union movement." The new Finance Minister and Romanian Communist Party Secretary Luca pointed out: The remarkable achievements of the Romanian trade union movement should be attributed to the fraternal unity and cooperation between the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party. Romanian Prime Minister Groza said with confidence: "The solidarity of the working people of the world will surely thwart the schemes of the instigators of a new war." Romanian General Confederation of Labor Chairman Apostol concluded the congress by saying: "The congress embodies the fighting will against imperialism and for the unity of the working class."

    赛南号召建立争取和平的国际阵线
    【新华社陕北十八日电】布加勒斯特讯：罗马尼亚总工会于十一日召开第二届代表大会，已于十五日在选出九十余人的新领导机关后，胜利宣告闭幕。列席会议者，有来自捷、保、阿、匈、奥、意诸国工会之代表团。世界职工联盟总书记赛南在会上致辞赞扬苏联为“替劳动人民争和平、民主、自由的真正战士”。并指出：“国际资本主义正对苏联发动最猛烈的攻击，因为他们认为对苏联的任何削弱都有助于他们阻挠国际工人阶级团结。”赛南号召工人阶级“建立为争取和平而斗争的伟大国际阵线。”赛南称颂“罗国历史已开始了新的世纪，不久以前还被奴役而不能表示其正义愿望与合理要求的罗国人民，今已能进行统一而组织良好的职工运动。”新任财长罗共书记路加指出：罗国职工运动的显赫成就，应归功于共产党与社会民主党间情同手足的团结与合作。罗总理格罗查充满信心地说：“全世界劳动人民的团结，必将挫败新战争挑唆者的图谋。”罗总工会主席亚波斯托尔对大会总结称：“大会体现了反对帝国主义和团结工人阶级力量的战斗意志。”
