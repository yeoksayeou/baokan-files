Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 14th. Belated news: Starving people in the Yan bandit-occupied area of Wenshui rose up to save themselves, distributing grain and property of traitorous despotic landlords. The movement began on September 16 in three villages, including Moumou Village west of the city. More than 40 starving people, under the same code of conduct, carrying cloth bags and shouting "This is the only way to save our lives, we can't wait to die anymore!" bravely rushed into the home of the traitorous despotic landlord Zhang Yi in the village, and distributed his grain and property. After the news spread, the masses in nearby villages also rose up to distribute more than 20 *shi* of grain and a lot of property from the big landlords Wu Guozhu and usurer Wang Huacheng, who colluded with the Yan puppet regime. At this point, the movement immediately expanded from the western half of the county to the eastern half. In early October, starving people in five villages east of the city, supported by our armed work team, distributed more than 20 *shi* of wheat, 20 to 30 large bundles of clothing, and some valuables from the family of the big landlord Zhang Xingtang. The next day, the masses in neighboring villages also arrested the traitorous despotic Han, and detained the big landlord Kang, ordering him to hand over more than 30 *shi* of wheat. In mid-October, the Yan bandits invaded Wenshui to seize conscripts and grain. Young people actively joined our armed work team and persisted in the struggle. Farmers' associations in various villages wrote letters warning landlords, enemies, and puppets. Now this movement has been extended to the vicinity of several Yan puppet strongholds.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, November 11th. The "common people's economy" harsh policies implemented by the Yan bandits in their occupied areas are becoming increasingly bizarre. The Yan bandits recently established so-called "cooperatives" in the streets of Taiyuan, strictly controlling materials and forcing citizens to buy shares. The share capital is based on the Chiang currency before the war, with one yuan equivalent to 100,714.2 yuan now. It is stipulated that people over the age of 13 must buy shares of the original Chiang currency of six yuan each, equivalent to more than 640,000 yuan in current Chiang currency. Those under the age of 12 must buy shares of the original Chiang currency of three yuan each. Public employees must also buy shares. Those who do not have money to buy shares are forced to borrow money by the Yan bandits. The rich and powerful then take the opportunity to lend money at high interest rates and exploit the people to their heart's content. In addition, consumption is restricted, stipulating that each person can only buy two baked wheaten cakes or fried dough twists at a time, and those who violate the rules will be fined 30 to 50 times the price. Whether residents or merchants, all must pay heavy taxes on their houses, also based on the pre-war legal tender, divided into seven levels, with each room paying a monthly tax of 1 jiao to 2 yuan. This tyranny has even been extended to the monks in the temples. As a result, large numbers of citizens are unemployed and committing suicide, and incidents of starving people robbing baked wheaten cakes, cigarettes, etc., are happening everywhere on the streets.

　　阎匪勒索愈益凶暴
  　文水饥民分财自救
    【新华社晋绥十四日电】迟到消息：晋中文水阎占区饥民奋起自救，分配奸霸地主粮食财物。运动首于九月十六日在城西某某等三村爆发，四十余饥民在同一行动纪律下，背着布袋，高呼“救命的路只有这一条，不能再等死啦！”勇猛冲进该村奸霸大地主张义家里，将其粮食财物分配。消息传出后，附近村庄群众亦奋起分配勾结阎伪的大地主武国柱和高利贷者王化成等之粮食二十多石及财物甚多。到此，运动遂立即从西半县扩展至东半县，十月初城东某五村饥民在我武工队支持下，分配了大地主张行堂家麦子二十余石，衣物二三十大包及贵重东西一部。隔日，邻村群众亦逮捕奸霸韩某，并将大地主康某扣起，令其交出麦子三十余石。十月中旬阎匪出犯文水抓丁抢粮，青壮年纷纷参加我武工队，坚持斗争，各村农民团并写信警告地主敌伪。现此一运动已推至若干阎伪据点附近。
    【新华社晋绥十一日电】阎匪在其统治区所施行之“平民经济”苛政，花样愈出愈奇。阎匪近日在太原各街成立所谓“合作社”，严厉统制物资，并强迫市民入股，股金以抗战前之蒋币为标准，每一元折合现在十万零七千一百四十二元，规定十三岁以上者每人入股原蒋币六元，折现蒋币六十四万余元，十二岁以下者，每人入股原蒋币三元。公教人员也要入股。无钱入股者阎匪则强迫其借债。有钱有势者遂乘机大放高利贷，尽情剥削人民，此外并限制消费，规定每人每次只能买两个烧饼或麻花，违者处以三十倍至五十倍之罚金。市民住屋无论是住户或商户，均须纳重税，亦以抗战前法币为标准，共分七级，每间房每月纳税一角至二元，此种暴政甚至已施及庙宇中之和尚。因而市民大批失业自杀，街上到处有饥民抢烧饼、纸烟等事件发生。
