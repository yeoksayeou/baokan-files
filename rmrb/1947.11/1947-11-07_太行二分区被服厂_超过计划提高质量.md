    Taihang Second Military Subdistrict Clothing Factory
    Exceeds Plan and Improves Quality
    [Report from our Taihang correspondent dated the 4th] Inspired by the nationwide counter-offensive, all the workers of the Second Military Subdistrict Clothing Factory launched an enthusiastic competition to rush-produce cotton-padded clothes to support the southward-bound army. They completed a month's plan in 26 days, producing a total of ×× sets of cotton-padded clothes. Both quality and quantity were improved, and raw materials were saved. When allocating linings for cotton-padded clothes, the superiors stipulated using 50% old materials. The workers said, "Saving more new cloth will allow us to make more new cotton-padded clothes, arm more soldiers, and defeat the bandit Chiang sooner!" As a result, 95% of the cotton-padded clothes were fitted with old linings, and the fittings were sturdy and beautiful. The comrades of the machine work group, in order to complete the cotton-padded clothes early, personally took action under the leadership of the group leader and deputy group leader. They formed two mutual aid groups based on labor and technology, increasing the speed from 14 sets per day in the past to 33 sets per day. They also challenged the dyeing and cutting groups with the condition that they do well and do it quickly. When other groups heard about the fast mutual aid production, they also organized mutual aid groups one after another and accepted the challenge from the machine work group. The machine work group, fearing falling behind, added night shifts, processing all night for six consecutive days. They were unwilling to leave their machines even when the sun was high the next morning. As a result of the mutual aid competition, the quality was unprecedentedly improved. In addition to increasing the number of sets from 14 to 33, the machine work group increased the number of stitches per inch from 12 to 14, and the cotton was packed evenly in thickness. In the past, 50 sleeves were attached per day, but now this has increased to 120. The dyeing group has increased from dyeing 1,500 square feet per person per day to 4,500 square feet.

    太行二分区被服厂
    超过计划提高质量
    【本报太行四日电】二分区被服厂全体职工，在全国各地大反攻的鼓舞下，掀起了热烈的赶制反攻棉衣支援南下大军的竞赛运动，廿六天完成了一个月的计划，共做出棉衣××套。质量数量提高，节省了原料。配棉衣里时，上级规定用百分之五十旧的，工人们说：多节省一些新布，就能多做一件新棉衣，多武装一个战士，就能早些打败蒋贼！”结果百分之九十五的棉衣都配上了旧里子，而且配的结实好看。机工组的全体同志，为了赶早完成棉衣，由正副组长亲自下手，按劳力、技术组成两个互助组，把速度由过去每天做十四套增加到三十三套，并向染工、裁工等组提出挑战，条件是做好、做快。其他组听说，互助生产快，也都纷纷组织了互助组，并向机工组应战。机工组怕落了后，全部加了夜工，一连六天都是通夜加工，次早太阳多高了，还不愿离机子。由于互助竞赛结果，质量空前提高，机工组除十四套增至卅三套外，每寸由十二针增至十四针，并且把棉花装的厚薄均匀。上袖的过去每日上袖五十件，现已增到一百二十件，染工组由每人每日染一千五百方尺，增至四千五百方尺。
