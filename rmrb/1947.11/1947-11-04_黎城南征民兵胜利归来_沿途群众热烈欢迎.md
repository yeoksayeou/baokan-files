    Licheng Militiamen Return Victoriously from Southern Expedition; Masses Warmly Welcome Them Along the Way
    [This newspaper, Licheng, reports] The militiamen who followed General Qin Jiwei on the southern expedition, having completed their mission, returned in triumph on the 25th of last month, and were warmly welcomed by the masses along the way. When the masses in the villages of Dongshuiyang and Xishuiyang heard that the militiamen would be staying overnight in their villages, the men busily fetched water and gathered firewood to start fires, while the women rolled noodles and cleaned the houses. Cheng Jing'e, the chairman of the women's association, organized several women to specifically find quilts and cook for the sick soldiers, asking them about their comfort and warmth in the houses where they stayed, and providing them with water for washing their faces. The sick soldiers were moved and said, "The villagers treat us so well, we will participate in the war again next time." Jin Yuliang, a Taihang cotton-planting expert, was harvesting in the fields when he heard that the militiamen were returning. Without bothering to return home to put away his farm tools, he ran to the Li-Lu Bridge, two miles away from the village, to greet them. The masses in Zhaodian heard that the militiamen would not be staying in their village (as originally planned), so they voluntarily carried dates and cigarettes on their backs to Shuiyang to express their gratitude. The next day, the militiamen, carrying the banner "Banner of Hard Struggle" presented to them by the Ninth Column, set off from Dongshuiyang to the city. Villagers from all the villages along the way greeted them outside the villages with gongs and drums. Minister Qiao of the Licheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, along with the county magistrate and deputy magistrates, also led all the county and district cadres (who were in a meeting) in a procession to welcome them. The militiamen, seeing that the leaders had also come to welcome them, were even more invigorated. Each carried the bamboo goods they had brought back from Qinghua, forgetting their fatigue. Some lightly ill soldiers were so moved that they felt embarrassed to sit in the carts, and they all got out of the carts and followed behind the team, leaning on their crutches. The city was like celebrating the New Year that day, the streets were cleaned especially thoroughly, and the doors of all the shops were decorated with the flags of the Chinese Communist Party. To show their appreciation to the militiamen on the southern expedition, they offered discounted sales for three days. The Liming Opera Troupe of the county also came to perform for three nights. The militiamen, under the warm hospitality of the masses, forgot the cold (still wearing single-layer clothing) and fatigue, and all felt honored and happy. In order to achieve greater victories in future battles, they are now conducting experience summaries and selecting model soldiers by team.

    黎城南征民兵胜利归来
    沿途群众热烈欢迎
    【本报黎城讯】随秦基伟将军南征的民兵，完成任务后，于上月二十五日凯旋归来，沿途群众热烈欢迎。东西水洋两村的群众，一听说民兵黑夜要往他村住，男人便忙着担水、弄柴烧火，妇女杆面条打扫家。妇救主席程景娥组织了几个妇女，专门给病号找被子做饭，到病号住的房子内去问冷问热，又给他们打洗脸水。病号们感动的说：“老乡们对咱们这样好，下次参战还要去。”太行植棉能手靳玉良正在地里收耕，听说民兵回来了，没顾的回家送农具，就跑到距村二里以外的黎潞桥上去迎接。赵店的群众听说民兵不到他村住了（原说到他村住），自动背上枣子、纸烟到水洋去慰问。第二天，民兵同志们打着九纵队赠予他们“艰苦奋斗的旗帜”的大旗，从东水洋出发到城内，沿途各村老乡却打着锣鼓到村外迎接。中共黎城县委会乔部长、正副县长也带领全体县区干部（正在开会）结队去欢迎。民兵们看到首长们也来欢迎自己，精神更加焕发，个个担着他们从清化捎回来的竹货担子，忘记了疲劳，有些轻病号感动的不好意思在车上坐了，都下来车拄着拐子跟在队伍的后边。这天城里象过年一样，街道打扫的特别干净，各商店的门上都插着中共党旗，并为慰劳南征民兵，特减价售货三天。本县黎明剧团，也赶来演剧三夜。民兵同志们，在群众的热情招待下，忘记了寒冷（还穿着单衣）和疲劳，一致感到光荣和愉快。为再次参战取得更大胜利，他们正以队为单位，进行总结经验和评选模范。（履端、靖国、连璧）
