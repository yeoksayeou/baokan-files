	Military Supply Workers Exert Hundredfold Efforts
	Intensify Manufacturing of Counter-Offensive Munitions
	[Our Newspaper’s Report] The ordnance factory and repair shop of the military region's supply department are mostly workers who were liberated this May. Since joining the factory, they have been enthusiastically serving the people. Since the great counter-offensive, they have been putting in hundredfold effort to improve their work and support the front lines. Led by squad leader Liang Jinming, everyone starts work half an hour early. Now, before work time, everyone is already hard at work in the workshop. Li Chunshan is unwilling to rest during breaks from repairing machine guns, and voluntarily finds a rifle to repair. In their work, they constantly contribute and improve their skills. For example, Comrade Geng Xiang has modified the car-washing belt, saving two man-days each day. Now, he is working with Comrades Sun Yuwen and Li Zhiguang to actively research self-made wheeled vehicles to improve work efficiency. Others are thinking of building a power engine. Comrade Bai Jinliang voluntarily challenged the people in his squad to a competition to do extra voluntary work. Therefore, many people eagerly come to wipe and repair the machine guns after the lights are turned on at night, or voluntarily sign up to crank the large wheel for the night shift. After working at night, they actively study to improve their education.
	[Another Report] The military supply bomb factory is taking practical action to support the front lines. Electrician Zhang Xiangyuan voluntarily went to the completion department to pick up shell casings, and returned to pick up pig iron. In a few days, he picked up a total of 4,300 shell casings and 2,960 catties of pig iron. Someone asked him how much money he earned? He said, "Why do I need money to overthrow Old Chiang?" After work, the powder milling, tinplate, and assembly squads all compete to participate in this voluntary labor. For example, Li Chunxiang, a female worker in the fuse squad, in addition to participating in picking up shell casings and pig iron after work, also winds copper wire under the lamp at home. The shock brigade voluntarily picked up 13,200 catties of pig iron and 5,720 shell casings in their spare time. Now, 150 workers have actively participated in picking up pig iron and shell casings. The sand turning division cannot participate in this voluntary labor, so they turn on the lights before dawn and work for two hours before it gets light. The factory director tried to stop them, but it was no use. Now, they produce twice as many shell casings each day as they did in the past. Wang Xingcheng (female worker), a model worker in the assembly squad, tied 6,200 tubes a day, setting a new record. Han Tianbao from the woodworking squad made 700 wooden handles in one day. Comrade Jia Liangyin from the woodworking squad is very ill, but he does not rest. He drinks a bowl of boiled water early in the morning and goes to work. Zhou Nengfu from the gun repair squad said: "I will never ask for leave to go home until Chiang Kai-shek is overthrown!" (Nai Hua)

    军供工人努力百倍
    加紧制造反攻军火
    【本报讯】军区供给部炸弹厂修械工部，大部分是今年五月解放过来的工人，他们自到厂后，即热诚为人民服务，大反攻以来，更是百倍努力提高工作支援前线。在班长梁金明带头下，大家都早上半点钟的工。现在每天未到上工时间，大家都早在工房叮叮当当干开了。李春山在修机枪的空隙中，他仍不愿休息，自动找支步枪去修。工作中他们不断供献和提高技术，如耿祥同志改造了洗车的皮带，每天节省了两个人工，现在他又同孙玉文、李志广等同志，正在积极研究自造元车，来提高工作，还有人想自造一个动力机。白金亮同志自动和班里人提出挑战比赛加义务工，因此每天晚上点灯后，有许多人争着来擦洗修好的机枪，或自动报名去给夜班摇大轮。晚上工作后他们还要积极学习，提高文化。
    【又讯】军供炸弹厂以实际行动来支援前线。电灯工人张相远同志自动去给完成部挑弹壳，回来挑生铁，几天工夫共挑弹壳四千三百个，生铁二千九百六十斤，有人问他赚多少钱？他说为了打倒老蒋要钱干啥。以后碾药、洋铁班、装配班下工后，都争相参加这个义务劳动。如拉火班女工李春香，下工后除参加挑弹壳生铁外，回家灯下还要缠铜丝。突击班在工余时间义务挑生铁一万三千二百斤，挑弹壳五千七百二十个，现已有一百五十个工人积极参加挑生铁和弹壳。翻沙工部不能参加这个义务劳动，他们天不明就点灯干，干两个钟头后天才亮，厂长阻止也不行，现每天出弹壳比过去增加二倍还多。装配班功臣王兴成（女工）拴管一天拴到六千二百个，创造了新纪录。木工班韩天保一天已做到七百个木把，木工班贾良银同志病的很重，也不休息，清早喝碗开水就又上工走了。修枪工部周能富说：不打倒蒋介石我永远不请假回家。（乃华）
