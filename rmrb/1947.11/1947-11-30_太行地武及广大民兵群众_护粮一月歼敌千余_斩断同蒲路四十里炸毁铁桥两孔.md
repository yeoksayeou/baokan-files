[Reported from Taihang, 28th of this month] The Taihang border area's grain protection struggle and anti-nibbling war have unfolded fiercely. From the 20th of last month to the 19th of this month, great victories have been achieved. According to preliminary statistics, eleven strongholds, including Xifengfeng west of Jiaozuo, were captured, eight blockhouses were burned down, and 1,092 Chiang-Yan bandits, from battalion commander down, were killed or wounded. 211 local bullies were captured alive. The following were seized: one small cannon, fifteen machine guns, three machine gun barrels, 169 long and short guns, more than 5,200 rounds of ammunition, 79 livestock, four war horses, three bicycles. More than 20 *li* of railway were destroyed, two iron bridges were blown up, over 100 *jin* of electrical wire was cut, and four iron rails were carried back. On the 18th of this month, part of our Fourth Military Sub-district's local armed forces suddenly surrounded the Chiang bandit stronghold of Xifengfeng west of Jiaozuo at night. After three hours of fierce fighting, 68 Chiang bandits of the 38th Division were killed, wounded, or captured, and seven bunkers were burned down. The village was recovered by us. In addition, more than 500 Chiang bandits of the 38th Division stationed in Wangfeng and Lifeng in Jiaozuo went to more than ten villages, including Madigou and Suojing, to plunder grain on the 2nd of this month. They were blown up by the landmine formation set up by our militia, resulting in 43 casualties. The enemy was defeated and returned. After the Chiang bandit local bullies occupied Tangyin city on the 10th of this month in the Fifth Military Sub-district, they actively organized local bandits, gangsters, and despots to nibble away at our territory. Our independent battalion and militia launched continuous attacks and won repeated victories. From the 11th to the 15th of this month, in five days, 123 enemies were killed, wounded, or captured, five rifles and more than 30 throwing spears were seized, and five strongholds, including Xiaoqingshan, were recovered. The Chiang bandit security brigade of Qi County was disturbed and plundered our territory of Qi County on the 13th of this month. After being severely attacked by our local armed forces, they fled in panic across the river to the east. Taking advantage of their scrambling to escape, we concentrated our fire and launched a fierce attack, killing, wounding, and capturing 35 enemies and sinking a ferry boat loaded with one machine gun, fifteen rifles, and over 100 *shi* of grain, all of which were submerged. Subsequently, on the night of the 18th, the unit cooperated with more than 400 people to penetrate deep into the Chiang area. After besieging the three strongholds of Litatun and other places with a portion of its forces, it destroyed six *li* of the Pinghan Railway between Ji County and Dahuangtun and repelled a Chiang bandit battalion that came to aid from Ji County. The local armed forces and the broad masses of the militia of the Second Military Sub-district crushed the continuous "water flooding" and grain-grabbing nibbling attacks launched by the Yan puppet 8th and 9th Columns and the 37th and 71st Divisions against our Yu-Tai-Qi area. We adopted tactics such as road destruction, ambush, and explosion to launch internal and external attacks against the enemy. After a month of arduous struggle, according to incomplete statistics, 367 Yan bandits of the 9th Column, from battalion commander down, were killed or wounded, 25 were captured alive, 78 rifles and six machine guns were seized, more than 600 rounds of ammunition were seized, 105 landmines were detonated, and five "water flooding sweeps" of 1,000 to 4,000 enemies were crushed. On the 9th of this month, our local armed forces and the broad masses of the militia, taking advantage of the enemy's all-out attack and the emptiness of their forces, immediately wedged themselves into the Tongpu Railway, from Dongyang in Yuci to Dongguan in Qi County, first surrounding the station. More than 40 *li* of railway were cut into several sections by us, and more than 10 *li* were destroyed. In addition, a detachment of engineers completely destroyed the two holes of the Uma River railway bridge in Taigu City, greatly undermining the Chiang-Yan bandit army's arrogant ambition to grab grain, and repelled a Yan bandit platoon that attacked from Taigu, and carried back four iron rails and more than 100 *jin* of electrical wire. The militia and the masses who insisted on fighting in the interior had their fighting spirit unprecedentedly enhanced due to the development of the autumn harvest and land distribution. More than 120 Yan bandits of the 9th Column stationed in Shangzhuang, Taigu, attacked Baiyan and Wangcun to grab grain on the 30th of last month. Our local armed forces and militia ambushed them between the two villages, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 30 enemies, from battalion commander down, and seizing one machine gun, twelve rifles, and 200 rounds of ammunition. The Taigu militia detonated 67 mines in ten days (from the 20th to the 30th of last month), killing, wounding, and capturing 125 enemies. Another group of more than 1,800 Yan bandits attacked Shiluomen on October 24 from Fancun, Taigu. After being severely attacked by a unit and militia guarding the high mountains east of Shiluomen, the enemy fled back to their original place in panic, and 31 were killed or wounded and two rifles were seized. After being repeatedly attacked by our troops, the enemy fled back to their strongholds one after another. The troops and broad masses of the militia of the First Military Sub-district, in order to cooperate with our army in liberating Shijiazhuang, actively launched a political offensive to besiege Wei Ni in Yuanshi and forced the three strongholds of Gaoqian, Chichun, and Dongcun outside Wei Ni's city to retreat. At this point, the vast countryside outside Yuanshi City was all liberated by us. Wei Ni feared our attack on the city and closed the four gates tightly, rushing to build fortifications, plotting to prolong his last gasp.
