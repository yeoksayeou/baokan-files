　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: Belgrade dispatch: Yugoslav Minister of Labor, Krosdulovic, stated in a speech at the Fifth Plenary Session of the Yugoslav Unified Trade Unions that "Yugoslavia has embarked on the road of socialist development, and the increase in workers' wages will keep pace with the development of the socialist economy." Krosdulovic emphasized, "Yugoslavia has completely eradicated unemployment in the half-year since the implementation of the Five-Year Plan began this year." Krosdulovic continued, "Since the social-political and social-economic reforms, Yugoslavia has entered a period of peaceful development and has promulgated many laws to protect the interests of workers, the most important of which are the Wage Law, the Social Insurance Law, the provision of wages during annual leave, and the provision of leave before and after childbirth for female workers." Krosdulovic urged workers to further increase labor productivity in order to complete and exceed the Five-Year Plan and accelerate the country's industrialization and electrification. For this purpose, the Unified Trade Unions must also strengthen the recruitment of new cadres and increase the number of female workers, which currently accounts for only 22 percent of the total number of workers." The "Borba" newspaper, the organ of the Yugoslav Communist Party, praised the achievements of the Unified Trade Unions in educating workers to improve labor productivity, pointing out that "the average labor productivity of Yugoslav workers in the first half of this year has exceeded that of last year by 6.54 percent, while production costs have been reduced by 6.02 percent. Workers have put forward 26,833 rationalization proposals in half a year, of which 80 percent have been adopted. The Fifth Plenary Session of the Unified Trade Unions opened on the 10th, and its task is to summarize past experiences and formulate future tasks.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: Belgrade dispatch: The Sama-Sarajevo railway was completed and opened to traffic on the 16th. The route was independently built by a youth labor team composed of more than 11,000 Yugoslav and foreign youths. It is the largest and most arduous project in the first year of Yugoslavia's Five-Year Plan. It is 240 kilometers long and runs through the steel industry and mining center, which is of great value to industrial development. The entire project was completed in only 228 days, 14 days ahead of schedule. The entire line enthusiastically celebrated the completion of the railway the day before yesterday. Marshal Tito, the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, personally presided over the grand opening ceremony. When the first train, decorated with flowers and carrying the heroes who built the road, drove into the station, the Marshal delivered a speech and reviewed the youth labor team, ending the ceremony in jubilation.
