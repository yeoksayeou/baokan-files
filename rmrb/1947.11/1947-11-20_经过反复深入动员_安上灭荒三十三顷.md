　　After Repeated and In-Depth Mobilization
    Anshang Reclaims Thirty-Three Hectares of Wasteland
    [Report from this newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu Office, 18th] With the strong call and assistance of the government, Anshang has reclaimed thirty-three hectares of wasteland. Anshang Village in the Third District of Hua County has sixty hectares of land. This year, the rain came late and was abundant, resulting in lush weeds and abandoned seedlings. Apart from the fifteen hectares and fifty-six mu of seedling land and the ten hectares and seventy-four mu already plowed, the remaining thirty-three hectares and seventy mu were all wasteland. The masses had the following three concerns in their minds: (1) The higher-ups called for wasteland reclamation without understanding the situation, so the middle peasants were not motivated to produce; (2) There was too much wasteland, the work was too heavy, and there was a shortage of labor and livestock, leaving them helpless; (3) They were afraid of progressive taxation if they cultivated too much land. Due to these problems, the production enthusiasm of the masses could not be boosted. Since Comrade Li, Deputy Secretary of the Prefectural Committee, and Comrade Li, Deputy Commissioner of the Administrative Office, made a call at the victory celebration on September 10th, propaganda and mobilization were launched in the village. First, targeting the above three ideas, they pointed out, "Having only three rooms but no grain in the granary means that young and old will starve next spring!" and "In the past, progressive taxation was resented because of the landlords, but future taxation will be more reasonable." After collective discussions and individual talks, the thinking of the masses began to change, and twenty-one mutual aid groups were organized, and the entire village became busy. A production committee was also organized to be responsible for supervising the plan, and with the help of the resident agency, twelve hectares and sixteen mu of wasteland were eliminated in fifteen days. However, there were still twenty-one hectares and fifty-five mu of wasteland left. After another round of mobilization at the general meeting, discussions among mutual aid group leaders, discussions among military dependents, and the lead taken by government agencies and cadres themselves, the masses were once again invigorated. After eleven days of hard work, only nine hectares and fifty-five mu and four fen were left, and these were all lands of escaped landlords and lands that had not been cleared. Therefore, it was proposed at the mass meeting: "Whoever plants it will harvest the wheat, only paying public grain, and the land rights will be dealt with later." The masses competed to plant. After such repeated mobilization, all thirty-three hectares of wasteland in the village were eliminated.

　　经过反复深入动员
    安上灭荒三十三顷
    【本报冀鲁豫十八日电】在政府大力号召帮助下，安上灭荒三十三顷。滑县三区安上村，有地六十顷，今年落雨晚，雨水多，草盛苗荒，除有十五顷五十六亩苗地和已犁起十顷零七十四亩以外，其余三十三顷七十亩都是荒地，群众思想上存在着以下三个顾虑：（一）上级叫灭荒，不摸底，中农生产不带劲；（二）荒地多，活太重，劳力畜力缺，狗咬刺猬没处下嘴；（三）种地多，怕累进。由于存在这些问题，群众生产情绪鼓不起来。自九月十日由地委副书记李同志，及专署李副专员亲在祝捷大会上号召后，在村里即展开了宣传动员，首先针对着上面三种思想，指出了“光有三间房，囤里没有粮，熬到明年春，老少闹饥荒！”“从前累进怨地主，今后征收更合理”，经过集体谈、个别谈，群众思想起了波动，开始组织了二十一个互助组，全村群众紧张起来。又组织生产委员会，负责督促计划，十五天工夫在驻村机关帮助下，消灭荒地十二顷一十六亩。可是荒地还有二十一顷五十五亩，又经过大会动员，互助组长座谈，军工属座谈，机关带头，干部亲自动手等等影响下，群众又鼓了一把劲，经过十一天的努力，最后只剩九顷五十五亩四分了，这些都是逃亡地主和未被清理的土地。于是，又在群众会上提出：“谁种谁收麦，只拿公粮，地权以后处理”，群众争着要种。经过这样反复动员，全村三十三顷荒地，即全部消灭。
