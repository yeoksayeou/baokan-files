　　Wang Village Breaks Through the "Just Getting By" Mentality
  　Poor Peasants and Hired Laborers Take the Lead in Developing Sideline Occupations
    [Report from This Newspaper in Pingshun] Wang Village, in the First District, convened a village-wide meeting on the 10th of this month, attended by over 300 men and women. They summarized this year's harvesting and plowing campaign, completing the harvest in the entire village in 20 days. All the autumn land was plowed twice, and all the fertilizer was applied to the fields. Everyone was very excited and immediately discussed how to engage in winter production. At that time, some people felt they lacked the capital for production, while others were afraid of hardship and unwilling to go out. Another group thought that since they had harvested a lot of grain this autumn, it was enough to eat! Still others felt tired after the autumn's intensive efforts and wanted to "rest a bit." For example, Wang Wuyang said: "I harvested over ten *shi* of grain this year, which is enough for the two of us to eat." Generally, people harvested more grain this autumn, and this kind of thinking was prevalent. Therefore, the first thing proposed was to calculate the harvest, the war consumption, and the size of the family property and expenses. Branch Secretary Wang Xinke said: "Last year, I harvested twenty-one *lao dou* of grain, but this year, even with nine *mu* of land, I harvested more than seven *shi* less than last year. If we don't engage in proper production this winter, we will be constrained next spring. The current war consumption is very heavy, and we, the common people, must fully support it and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive." Wang Shuiqing said: "Our entire village harvested over one thousand six hundred *shi* less than last year. This is really a big obstacle. Our war expenditure is also very large, and our militiamen need to eat when they go out. We must develop winter production to make up for it." Jia Kai then said: "I will spin and weave over twenty *jin* of cloth this winter!" After discussion, calculating the family property, and clarifying their thinking, they recognized this year's poor harvest and war consumption, breaking through complacency and self-satisfaction. Everyone unanimously agreed that it was necessary to develop winter production. Immediately, with the poor peasants and hired laborers as the backbone, they voluntarily combined forces, first solving the difficulty of the poor peasants and hired laborers lacking capital, and decided to borrow money from the credit cooperative. They broke through the idea of looking down on small amounts of money and drew up a winter production plan. The entire village has 114 male laborers (capable of transportation), and this winter, they must earn back 11,400 *jin* of millet. The 20 livestock in the entire village must earn back 4,000 *jin* of millet. Each woman in the village must spin and weave 15 *jin* of floral cloth this winter, for a total of 2,250 *jin* in the entire village. The day after the meeting, over 30 people went out to transport goods, and six livestock had already gone out. Others are also actively preparing. (Qun You, Feng Xian)
    [Report from This Newspaper in Yushe] After the autumn harvest, the masses in Yangtian Village, in the Second District, generally held the "eat well this autumn whether you harvest or not" and "enough to eat is enough" mentality, which hindered the development of winter production. For example, Bai Wuliu, who harvested sixteen *shi* of grain this year, consumes five *shi* per year and uses three *shi* for clothing, leaving him with eight *shi*. He said, "It's enough for me to eat, why should I bother moving!" In response, we launched a campaign to calculate the harvest and wealth creation, breaking through negative thinking. For example, we asked Bai Wuliu: "Do you have livestock?" He said: "Livestock is still a problem!" "How much grain do you need to build three rooms?" After this calculation, the "just getting by" mentality was broken, and everyone said: "According to this calculation, we are still far behind! We must engage in proper production this winter!" Immediately, plans were made for spinning and weaving groups, oil pressing groups, herb digging groups, etc., doing whatever they could. Now the whole village is enthusiastically engaging in it with great energy. (Zhi Min, Geng Ming, Gai Mei)

　　王庄打破糊口思想
  　贫雇带头开展副业
    【本报平顺讯】一区王庄村本月十日召开全村男女三百余人的大会，总结今年收耕运动，全村二十天全部完成收耕，秋地全部耕过二遍，还把肥全部担在地里，大家都很兴奋，即时讨论如何搞冬季生产。当时有些人感到搞生产没有本钱，有些人怕受苦，不想出去；另一种是今秋打的粮食多够吃了就算了！更有人因经过今秋的突击都觉得累了，想“歇一歇”，如王五羊说：“我今年打了十来石粮食，够我二口人吃了。”今秋一般打的粮食多些，普遍存在着这种思想；据此，首先提出算收成，算战争消耗，算大小家当与开支等。支部书记王新科说：“我去年收了老斗二十一石粮食，今年还是九亩地，比去年少收七石多。今冬要不好好生产，明春就要受制。现在的战争消耗非常重，咱老百姓要全力支援，活捉蒋介石。”王水清说：“咱全村比去年少收一千六百余石，这真是个大圪道，咱们的战争开支也非常大，咱们的民兵出去也要吃，非开展冬季生产来补足不行。”贾开则说：“我今冬要纺织二十余斤布！”经过讨论，算大小家当，打通了思想，认识了今年的歉收与战争消耗，打破了麻痹自满思想，大家一致认为非开展冬季生产不行。当即以贫雇为骨干，自愿结合，首先解决了贫雇农没有本钱的困难，决定到信用社贷款。打破看不起小钱思想，订出冬季生产计划。全村共男劳力（能运输）一百一十四个，今冬要赚回一万一千四百斤小米；全村二十头牲口要赚回小米四千斤。今冬每个妇女要纺织十五斤花布，全村共纺织二千二百五十斤。会后第二天就有三十余人出去送脚，牲口也已出去六头。其他也都在积极准备。（群有、凤贤）
    【本报榆社讯】二区仰天村收秋后，群众普遍存在着“收不收吃一秋”及“够吃就行”的糊嘴思想，阻碍着冬季生产的开展。如白五六，他今年收粮食十六石，一个人全年吃五石，穿用三石，还余八石，他说：“我一人够吃了，还动弹他干甚！”据此，我们展开算收成，算发家，打破了消极思想，如问白五六：“你有牲口没有？”他说：“牲口还困难！”“你盖三间房要用多少粮食？”经这样计算，打破了糊嘴思想，都说：“照这样算咱还差的多哩！今冬还得好好生产！”随即订出计划。纺织组，油坊组，刨药材组等，能干甚干甚，现全村正热烈进行，劲头很大。（志敏、更明、改梅）
