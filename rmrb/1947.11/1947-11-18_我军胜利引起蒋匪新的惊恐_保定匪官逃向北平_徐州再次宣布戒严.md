　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th. The victorious offensive of the Jin-Cha-Ji and Su-Lu-Yu-Wan People's Liberation Army has caused new panic among the Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities. After Shijiazhuang was liberated by the People's Liberation Army, according to a United Press Beiping dispatch, "Baoding (Chiang) provincial government officials immediately fled to Beiping by car." Reuters described the Shijiazhuang battle as a "new setback" for the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and United Press said it was a "considerable victory" for the People's Liberation Army. When the People's Liberation Army besieged the area, Chiang Kai-shek personally ordered "at all costs" to "hold this important railway junction" and ordered the Chiang Kai-shek bandit air force to "do everything possible to cooperate." Xuzhou, due to the approach of the People's Liberation Army with "powerful forces," has once again announced martial law. The Chiang Kai-shek Xuzhou Garrison Headquarters "ordered strict control of all night traffic, instructing residents not to go out at night" (Associated Press). The Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities often fabricate losses of the People's Liberation Army in order to cover up their disastrous defeats on all fronts, but according to the Associated Press, "Most people are extremely sarcastic about the Kuomintang army's estimates of Communist casualties," believing that many of the figures published by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities in this regard "are laughable."

　　我军胜利引起蒋匪新的惊恐
  　保定匪官逃向北平
    徐州再次宣布戒严
    【新华社陕北十五日电】晋察冀和苏鲁豫皖人民解放军的胜利攻势，已引起蒋匪当局新的惊恐。石家庄为人民解放军解放后，据合众社北平消息，“保定（蒋）省政府官员立刻乘汽车逃向北平”。路透社将石家庄战役形容为蒋匪“新挫败”，合众社说这是人民解放军“可观的胜利”。在人民解放军围攻该地时，蒋介石曾亲下令“以一切代价”“守住这一重要铁路会合点”，并令蒋匪空军“竭尽全力配合”。徐州因“力量强大”之人民解放军的逼近，已再次宣布戒严，蒋匪徐州警备司令部“下令严厉管制夜间一切交通来往，指令居民夜间不得外出（美联社）。蒋匪当局为掩饰其各线惨败，经常捏造人民解放军的损失，但据美联社称：“大多数人士对国民党军所作共军伤亡估计持极端冷讥热讽态度”，认为蒋匪当局所发表此方面的许多数字“是可笑的”。
