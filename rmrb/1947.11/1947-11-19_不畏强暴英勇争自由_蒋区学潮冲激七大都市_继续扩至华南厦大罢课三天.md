Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: Comprehensive report: The righteous movement of students in the Chiang-controlled areas against oppression and for freedom, sparked by the Chiang bandits' murder of Yu Zisan, chairman of the Student Self-Government Association of Zhejiang University, is the third great struggle of students in the Chiang-controlled areas this year, following the movement against American imperialist aggression in the spring and the anti-hunger and anti-civil war movement in the summer. It is also a direct result of the Chiang bandits' large-scale expulsion, arrest, and slaughter of students and the dismissal of professors since June and July. According to extremely incomplete reports from foreign news agencies: From the outbreak of the strike and demonstration at Zhejiang University on October 30th to November 14th, the strike and demonstration actions of students in the Chiang-controlled areas have expanded from Hangzhou to seven major cities: Peiping, Tianjin, Nanjing, Shanghai, Kunming, and Xiamen. The struggle involves all universities and middle schools in Peiping and Kunming, Zhejiang and Zhijiang in Hangzhou, Hujiang, Jiaotong, St. John's, and Fudan in Shanghai, Jinling and Central in Nanjing, Nankai and Jiji Institute of Technology in Tianjin, and Xiamen University in Xiamen, with more than 100,000 students participating.

In this movement, students in the Chiang-controlled areas demonstrated a spirit of bravery in the face of brutality. Zhejiang University held two week-long strikes and demonstrations. Shanghai Jiaotong University, which was once disbanded and reorganized by Chiang Kai-shek in July for its anti-hunger and anti-civil war strike, also held a sympathy strike, defying all persecutions by the Chiang bandits. On November 6th, students from all universities and middle schools in Peiping held a general strike. On the 7th, they broke through the armed encirclement of the Chiang bandit military police and secret agents and held a solemn memorial service for the martyr Yu Zisan. On November 6th, more than 20,000 students from more than 30 universities and middle schools in Kunming held a general strike and then marched in formation, surrounding the residence of Lu Han, chairman of the Chiang bandit Yunnan Provincial Government, demanding the immediate release of all arrested students. Broad social sympathy lies with the students fighting for democracy. Professors from Yenching, Tsinghua, and Peking Universities in Peiping issued declarations and speeches, supporting the students' just demands and condemning the Chiang bandit atrocities. Professors and staff of St. John's University in Shanghai also participated in the unified action with the students.

The students' heroic struggle frustrated the ferocity of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. The fascist beast Chiang Kai-shek personally summoned all secret service chiefs in Nanjing on November 9th to discuss ways to suppress the student movement. During the student strike, the Chiang bandit authorities in Peiping arrested ten students from Tsinghua, Peking, and Yenching Universities and instructed Sanqing Tuan secret agents to beat six students from the Peiping Normal College. However, in the face of the Peiping students' stubborn struggle of "no resumption of classes without the release of the arrested students," the Chiang Kai-shek Peiping Pacification Headquarters had to release these arrested students and promised to compensate the injured students for their medical expenses. From this, the students in the Chiang-controlled areas realized that unity is strength and that resolute resistance is the only way to survive, further enhancing their confidence in victory.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: The wave of students in the Chiang-controlled areas fighting for freedom has expanded to South China. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Xiamen on the 15th: Xiamen University began a three-day strike on the 14th to protest the Chiang bandits' murder of martyr Yu Zisan of Zhejiang University, and fasted for one day to provide relief to the martyr's family. According to a United Press dispatch from Shanghai: The Chiang bandits continued to persecute students in Shanghai. On the 15th, fourteen university students were expelled for strike demonstrations, and many students were beaten while distributing leaflets on the streets.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 17th: More than 600 teachers and students from primary and secondary schools in Jingjiang City, Suzhong, went on strike and demonstrated against the Chiang bandit county government's corruption and deduction of salaries, achieving victory. Since the beginning of this semester, the salaries of teachers and staff in primary and secondary schools in the city have been exploited and deducted by the Chiang bandit county government, leaving them with only 150,000 Chiang currency per month, bringing their lives to the brink of desperation. On October 25th, teachers from all seven primary and secondary schools in the city went on strike simultaneously, and more than 600 teachers and students jointly marched, distributing leaflets along the way, shouting slogans against corruption and demanding full salaries, and demonstrating directly in front of the Chiang bandit county government. Zhu Weirong, secretary-general of the Chiang bandit county party headquarters, attempted to delay and deceive with "resolution within half a month," but the teachers and students insisted on not resuming classes until full salaries were paid. After a week of striking, the Chiang bandits were finally forced to pay the back wages.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 17th: Jinan newspapers report: Students of Jinan Normal School demanded improved living conditions and opposed the principal's corruption, going on strike from October 27th. When the students gathered on the 28th, Principal Sun Weiyu attempted to threaten them to leave the school. The students then decided to establish a public grain management committee and a post-incident committee to temporarily handle school affairs, and issued a telegram in the name of the student union demanding the dismissal of Sun Weiyu. Although the Chiang bandit authorities and the school authorities suppressed and mediated in many ways until the 29th, all the students still insisted on the strike.

　　不畏强暴英勇争自由
  　蒋区学潮冲激七大都市
    继续扩至华南厦大罢课三天
    【新华社陕北十七日电】综合报导：半月来以蒋匪杀害浙大学生自治会主席于子三事件为导火线的蒋管区学生反压迫争自由的正义运动，是蒋管区学生继今年春天反对美帝国主义侵略运动、夏天反饥饿、反内战运动后的本年度第三次伟大斗争。亦是蒋匪六、七月以来大举开除逮捕屠杀学生、解聘教授的直接结果。据外国通讯社极不完全的报导：自上月三十日浙大爆发罢课示威至本月十四日半个月内，蒋管区学生的罢课示威行动已由杭州而扩展至北平、天津、南京、上海、昆明、厦门七大城市，卷入斗争中的有平、昆两地全市大中学，杭州的浙江、之江，上海的沪江、交通、圣约翰、复旦，南京的金陵、中央，天津的南开、冀工学院，厦门的厦大等大中学人数在十万以上。
    在这次运动中，蒋管区学生表现出不畏强暴的英勇气概。其中浙大曾两度举行为期各一周的罢课示威。本年七月间，曾因反饥饿反内战罢课而一度遭蒋介石解散改组的上海交大，亦蔑视蒋匪一切迫害举行同情罢课。北平全市大中学学生于本月六日举行总罢课，七日复冲破蒋匪军警特务的武装包围，举行悲壮的于子三烈士追悼大会。本月六日昆明全市大中学三十余单位二万余人举行总罢课后，并整队示威游行，包围蒋匪云南省政府主席卢汉住宅，要求立即释放一切被捕学生。广大社会同情是属于为民主而斗争的学生方面的，北平燕京、清华、北京等大学教授纷纷发表宣言演说，支持学生正义要求，斥责蒋匪暴行。上海圣约翰大学教授、校工亦参加与学生一致行动。
    学生们的英勇斗争挫折了蒋介石匪帮的凶焰。法西斯野兽蒋介石本月九日曾在南京亲自召集一切特务头子，商讨镇压学生运动的办法。在学生罢课期中，北平蒋匪当局曾逮捕清华、北大、燕大学生十人，并曾指使三青团特务殴伤了北平师院的六个学生。但在北平学生“不释放被捕同学决不复课”的顽强斗争中，蒋介石北平行辕不得不释放了这些被捕学生，并答应赔偿受伤学生的医药费。蒋管区学生从此更认识团结就是力量，坚决反抗才能生存，更增强胜利信心。
    【新华社陕北十七日电】蒋管区学生争自由的浪潮已扩大至华南。据美联社厦门十五日讯：厦门大学十四日开始罢课三天，抗议蒋匪杀害浙大于子三烈士，并节食一天救济于烈士家属。另据合众社沪讯：蒋匪续在上海迫害学生，十五日已有大学生十四人因罢课示威而被开除，好些学生在街头上散布传单时被殴打。
    【新华社华中十七日电】苏中靖江城六百余中小学师生罢教罢课示威游行，反对蒋匪县府贪污克扣薪金获得胜利。自本学期开学以来，该城中小学教职员薪金经蒋匪县府剥削克扣后，每月仅得蒋币十五万元，生活濒于绝境，十月二十五日，全城七所中小学教师同时罢教，师生六百余联合游行，沿途散发传单，高呼反对贪污、要求发足薪金等口号，并直抵蒋匪县府门口示威，蒋匪县党部书记长祝唯荣企图以“半个月内解决”拖延欺骗，但师生们坚持一天不发足一天不复课，罢教罢课一周后，蒋匪卒被迫补发薪水。
    【新华社山东十七日电】济南报纸讯：济南师范学生要求改善生活反对校长贪污，于十月二十七日起罢课，二十八日学生集会时，校长孙维狱企图威胁不逞离校，学生遂决议成立公粮保管委员会，成立善后委员会等组织，暂时处理校务，并以学生自治会名义通电要求将孙维狱撤职，至二十九日止虽经蒋匪当局及校方多方镇压调解，全体学生仍坚持罢课中。
