    Infinite Firelight
    A Close-Up of the Destruction of the Longhai Railway

    The roar of cannons blended into one. It was our East China troops encircling and annihilating the Chiang bandit 57th Division. We accepted the task of destroying the Longhai Railway. Every comrade participating in the destruction made full preparations, carrying full weapons, and two people sharing a five-foot-long wooden pole, and also preparing a night meal. To ensure the completion of this great task, we put forward the destruction mobilization slogans: 1. This destruction is to cut off the legs of the Chiang army to cooperate with the main force in fighting a major battle to eliminate the enemies in the inner lines. 2. Everyone work harder; destroying one more li of land is equal to eliminating one more company of the enemy. 3. We will put in more effort and sweat in this destruction, and the main force will shed less blood in the front lines. 4. See who does a good job of destroying the road and get meritorious service and report it upwards. After the mobilization, everyone was in high spirits, and several people with minor illnesses also actively participated.
    We set off at four o'clock in the afternoon, a forty-li forced march, crossing several muddy waters of the old Yellow River, still without the people resting or the horses stopping. Arriving at the destination, Liuzhuang, Company Commander Liu Shaoguang took a platoon to understand the situation and captured four railway repair workers and obtained seven tools, which helped us quickly destroy the rails and accelerate the speed of destruction.
    Each company and platoon were assigned their tasks, the cadres took charge, and in order, they all inserted the poles under the rails. The destruction commander raised his voice and shouted: "Get ready and use your strength! One, two!" The rails and sleepers raised their heads with the "one, two" slogan, "Comrades! Use your strength! One, two!" The rails and sleepers stood up high again, "Add more effort! One, two!" The railway was overturned under everyone's concerted effort. The speed of destruction increased everyone's confidence in the victory of destruction. Then, the soldiers of the three companies organized two platoons each to take turns destroying the rails, and the destruction team advanced eastward. Only the commander comrade shouted loudly: "Comrades! Don't shout, the railway has been broken open, and it will be easier to lift later. The cannon sounds in the north are the main force annihilating the Chiang bandit army. Our destruction here is to cooperate with the main force in combat, to block the enemy's advance and retreat. When I shout the one-two slogan, everyone immediately lifts with force! One, two!" "Add oil! One, two!" "Chiang Kai-shek is about to fall! One, two!" "Add more effort! One, two!" "Each company strives for model! One, two!" "Strive for reporting! One, two!" After each "one, two" was shouted, all the comrades shouted in unison "Hm!" The rails and sleepers rolled over with a "creak" section by section. Under this vigorous and concerted effort of everyone, six and a half li of railway was destroyed in three hours.
    While everyone was still actively destroying the rails, signal flares were emitted from the command post far to the west. The assembly call also sounded. Each company assembled and walked along the path beside the road toward the firelight assembly point. Illuminated by the firelight from the burning sleepers, everyone returned with a very happy mood. When we were ten li away from the railway, we could still see the infinite firelight. ...

    无穷的火光
    陇海破击特写
    林南
    炮声隆隆响成一个了。那是我华东部队在围歼蒋匪五十七师。我们接受了破坏陇海铁路的任务，每个参加破击的同志都作了充分的准备，除带全付武装外，两个人找一根五尺长的木杠子，并准备了夜饭一顿。我们为保证这一伟大任务的完成，提出了破击动员口号；一、这次破击是截断蒋军的腿来配合主力打大仗来消灭内线敌人。二、大家一齐加油干多破一里地等于多消灭敌人一个连。三、我们这次破击多出力流汗，主力前线作战少流血。四、破路看谁破的好又立功又上报。动员后大家情绪都很高，有几个轻病号也积极的参加了。
    下午四点钟出发了，四十里地的急行军，穿过老黄河的几道泥水，仍然人不休息，马不停蹄。到达了目的地刘庄，一连长刘绍广同志带了一个排了解情况时，就俘虏了铁路上的修路工人四名，获工具七件，这就帮助我们很快的破坏了铁轨，加速了破击的速度。
    各连排都分好了工，干部掌握好，按次序的一齐将杠子插到铁轨底下，破击指挥员提高了嗓子喊着：“准备好用力呀！一二！”铁轨枕木随着“一二”的口号抬起了头，“同志们！用力呀！一二！”铁轨枕木随着又大立起来了，“再加一把油呀！一二！”铁路在大家齐心用力下大翻了身。破击的速度增加了每个同志的破击胜利信心，接着三个连的战士各组织两个排上下轮流着破击，破击的队伍向东推进。只听得指挥员同志高嗓子喊着：“同志们！别嚷啦，铁路破开头啦，以后就更好掀啦，北边大炮声是主力消灭蒋匪军哩，咱们这里来破击是正为配合主力作战，阻击敌人前进与退撤，我喊个一二口号大家即用力掀呀！一二！”“加油啦！一二！”“蒋介石快倒啦！一二”！“再加把劲呀！一二！”“各连争取模范呀一二！”“争取上报呀！一二！”每个一二喊出后，全体同志齐呼“嗯！”铁轨枕木随着“咯嗟”一节节一段段的翻滚。就在这种轰轰烈烈的大家齐心努力破击下、三个钟头六里半地的铁道被破坏了。
    大家还正积极破击时远远的西边指挥所处发出了信号火光。集合号也响动了。各连集合，顺着道边的小路向着火光集合点走去。在枕木燃起的火光照耀下，大家怀归去着非常愉快的心情。当我们离开铁道十里时，还能望着无穷的火光。……
