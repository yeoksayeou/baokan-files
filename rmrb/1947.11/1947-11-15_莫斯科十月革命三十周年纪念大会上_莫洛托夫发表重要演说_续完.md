All these facts show that American imperialism intends to use the post-war difficulties of some countries to force others to accept its will under the guise of self-proclaimed American leadership and to pave the way for American world hegemony.

Can this be used as an excuse to justify the expectation that it may be possible to escape the growing domestic difficulties, perhaps to prevent the deep economic crisis from coming, and the increasing division of the United States into two major groups? (These two major groups are: on the one hand, the imperialist group that is now clamoring so fiercely, and on the other hand, the democratic group and those who will belong to the democratic group in the future.)

The greed of the imperialists is endless, and in order to achieve their selfish goals, they are prepared not only to trample on the rights and sovereignty of other countries, but also to destroy the democratic rights of their own countries under their iron heels.

Obviously, the lesson of the collapse of fascist Germany—which destroyed democratic forces and tried to seize world hegemony without measuring its own strength—has not been remembered by those who are blindly driven by the ambition to pursue world hegemony. Today, the ruling groups of the United States and Britain are leading an international group with the aim of strengthening capitalism and establishing their hegemony over other countries. These two countries are leading the imperialist and anti-democratic forces in international affairs, and are actively supported by prominent social democratic leaders in several European countries.

The principles upon which Soviet policy is based are exactly the opposite, namely, the principles of respecting the sovereignty of large and small countries and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.

Example Three of the Aggressive Policy of American and British Imperialism: The German Question.

Take the German question as an example:

If the United States and Britain could also abide by the democratic principles of the Yalta and Potsdam conferences in the post-war period, then the cooperation between the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain would now have good results, because those principles made it possible for the Allied countries to fight and eliminate the remnants of fascism in Hitler's Germany and achieve success. However, the United States and Britain abandoned these democratic principles and violated the decisions jointly adopted. This can be said on the following basic issues: such as the democratic reconstruction and demilitarization of Germany, and the payment of reparations to countries that suffered German occupation. As a result of the post-war policies of Britain and the United States, the British and American occupied zones of Germany have been merged into a jointly managed area, known in the press as the "Joint Occupation Zone," so that British and American policies can be pursued unilaterally and independently there, without being bound by the Allied Control Council, in which all four occupying powers are represented. In fact, our representatives in Germany now only deal with issues in the Soviet occupied zone. This has also caused a situation that can only make the German people uneasy, because as a result of British and American policies, there is a "Joint Occupation Zone," and there are other occupied zones, but there is no Germany, no complete German state. The Soviet Union believes that the decision on the German question at the Yalta and Potsdam conferences, which stipulated the restoration of Germany as a complete democratic state, must be implemented. The Soviet side fully recognizes that the "Joint Occupation Zone" is not Germany, and the German people have the right to demand their own country. Naturally, this country must be democratic and must not pose a new threat of aggression to other peace-loving countries. Today, there is an Anglo-American plan to throw a few bones to the people in the British and American occupied zones of Germany to buy them off, relying on the former German capitalists (who supported Hitler not long ago), and using the "Joint Occupation Zone" and its Ruhr industrial zone to threaten those countries that do not show slavish obedience to the Anglo-American plan to dominate Europe. However, these adventurous plans for Germany will not have any good results, and will naturally be rejected by the democratic people of the whole of Europe. This German example shows how far apart the current principles of Britain and the United States are from the principles of the Soviet Union. The principles of Britain and the United States are completely and blatantly imperialist, while the Soviet Union adheres to democratic principles.

The Soviet Union and the world's democratic people, united, will be able to stop the new war adventures of imperialism.

The Soviet Union and other democratic countries adhere to the position of peace and international cooperation on the democratic line. In the current situation, this requires the unity of all anti-imperialist and democratic forces in Europe and beyond, in order to build an indestructible fortress to prevent the increasingly rampant imperialism and its new policy of aggression. If the democratic forces unite and boldly fight against imperialism and its new war adventurous plans, it can unite the people of the world into a powerful army. This is of course not liked by imperialism, because imperialism's plan to deprive the democratic rights of all nations and trample on the sovereignty of various countries is based on coercion, deceit and crazy adventures.

In the imperialist camp, its unease and panic are growing day by day, because everyone sees that the foundation under imperialism is shaking, while the forces of democracy and socialism are increasing day by day. What can imperialist policies bring to all countries in the world? Only greater oppression, the revival of the hated fascism, and new adventures of imperialism. The people of the world must open their eyes to this, and all democratic and anti-imperialist forces must unite to smash any plan of imperialism to economically enslave countries and any new adventure. The historical experience of the Soviet Union confirms the words of the great Lenin: "Among the people, the majority of workers and peasants have recognized, felt and seen that the regime they are protecting is the regime of the working class, and the victory of the cause they are defending guarantees that they and their children can enjoy all the benefits created by human labor. Such a people is invincible."

Today's task is to unite all anti-imperialists and people's democratic forces, and to condense them into a powerful camp with common interests of life and death, in order to oppose the imperialist and anti-democratic camp and its policy of enslaving countries and indulging in new adventures. At the same time, a sober look will show that indulging in new adventures of imperialism is also putting the fate of capitalism at dangerous stakes. Some ministers and senators may not have realized this. But if the anti-imperialist democratic camp unites its forces and can use all opportunities, then they will force the imperialists to be a little more rational and a little more restrained. It can be asserted that capitalism itself is not willing to decline rapidly.

The Soviet people have a new spiritual structure, which is the greatest achievement of socialist construction.

As the great October Socialist Revolution enters its thirty-first year, I look back with satisfaction on the path we have traveled and look forward to the future with confidence. The achievements of the Soviet Union are truly great. Socialism has deeply penetrated our entire lives. In the Soviet era, a new generation has grown up, and they are beginning to spread their wings like falcons.

It must be admitted that the greatest achievement of our revolution is the new spiritual structure and intellectual growth of our people as Soviet patriots. This is true for all ethnic groups, urban and rural residents, manual laborers, and intellectual workers throughout the Soviet Union. This is indeed the highest achievement of the October Revolution, an epoch-making achievement. The Soviet people of today are different from those of thirty years ago. The spiritual structure of the Soviet people today is first and foremost manifested in a conscious attitude towards work, regarding their work as a matter of great social significance, and as a sacred duty to the Soviet state. Today, there are many male and female Stakhanovite workers in every factory. Socialist competition has spread to all collective farms. Workers, collective farmers, office workers, engineers and technicians, artists and scientists, all participate in socialist competition. Today, the scale and content of the competition are sufficient to show that the Soviet people's attitude towards work has reached the level of communism. This nationwide competition has made it the most important tool for increasing labor productivity. A new movement has now become popular, that is, individual workers are guaranteeing to complete their annual production plan and the entire five-year plan ahead of schedule, which has not been seen before the war. This movement is developing rapidly in Moscow, Leningrad, Donbass, and throughout the country, proving the socialist mentality of male and female laborers. But this is only one of the many effective methods for increasing labor productivity in our country.

This year, the grain production plan has been completed ahead of schedule. Although the grain producing area and the number of machines are less than before the war, the state will still receive grain slightly equal to the best year before the war. This achievement is due to the extensive socialist competition developed between republics and republics, border regions and border regions, states and states, especially due to the active participation of the entire collective farm and millions of men and women in the collective farm. At the beginning of the war, we had a very difficult time, until we adapted to the new conditions and transformed all our work before we overcame the difficulties.

The contributions of our workers in the rear and the heroism of our troops on the front line (which is unparalleled in world history) are manifestations of noble Soviet patriotism, which is the guarantee of our victory over the enemy. At present, the upsurge of Soviet patriotism is a prominent manifestation of the current ideological level and spiritual development of our Soviet people.

The Soviet people must also strengthen self-criticism and eliminate the ideological remnants of capitalism.

It is undeniable that the remnants of capitalism in people's minds are very stubborn. In order to eradicate these remnants of the old society, the Party constantly reminds the Soviet people of the necessity of conducting comprehensive criticism and self-criticism, and it is precisely for this reason. On the other hand, it is undeniable that we now have great opportunities to victoriously carry out the struggle to eradicate these remnants.

The cultural level of our people has been improved in all aspects, and the number of students, the number of published books, and the educational work among the masses have reached a level unparalleled in any other country. Our intellectuals, cultural workers, our scientists and our artists are ideologically imbued with unprecedented Soviet patriotism. The best literary works today are written by writers who consciously form an inseparable ideological connection with communism. In our country, communism inspires people to rush to passionate labor, bravely and vigorously serve the country, and carry out creative activities imbued with noble ideas.

During the war, the bourgeois hack writers hired by foreign countries dared to predict that when the Soviet people became familiar with Western civilization and order in their military operations, and when they had been to various European capitals and many cities, once they returned home, they would think of completely negating their own country. But what is the fact? The demobilized officers and soldiers began to strengthen their collective farms with greater enthusiasm upon their return, promoted socialist competition in factories and workshops, and stood at the forefront of Soviet patriots.

We have not all freed ourselves from adulation and worship of the West and of capitalist civilization. It was not insignificant that the ruling class of Old Russia was often in a deep spiritual dependence on the more highly developed European countries in terms of capitalism, which helped to cultivate servile psychological complexes, a sense of inferiority, and a spiritual dependence on the bourgeois countries of Europe among some members of the old intelligentsia. Unless these shameful remnants are shaken off, one cannot become a true Soviet citizen.

That is why we Soviet people must eliminate these remnants of the old society as soon as possible with such firm determination, and ruthlessly criticize all manifestations of adulation and worship of the West and its capitalist culture.

You should remember the historically significant words of Comrade Stalin on Soviet citizens: "The humblest Soviet citizen, freed from the shackles of capital, stands head and shoulders above any foreign high-ranking bureaucrat holding the yoke of capitalist slavery." The more we Soviet people understand Stalin's requirements for the consciousness and glory of a Soviet citizen, the faster we will move towards our great goal.

The thought of Marxism-Leninism has illuminated our path like the sun in the clear sky throughout these thirty years.

Capitalism is dying, and the Soviet people are leading the world towards the victory of communism!

Our progress is built on the foundation of Lenin and Stalin's strategy and tactics. Our road is not an easy road. Enemies from outside and inside have been very rampant, and even within the Bolshevik Party there have been agents of the enemy, such as the Trotsky bandits, rightists, and other traitors and defectors. The Bolshevik Party founded by Lenin and Stalin has been strengthened after experiencing all these tests, the ranks of the Party have been purified, and it has been condensed into a powerful force. This is the highest embodiment of the spiritual and political unity of our people - our people are advancing towards a communist society with full confidence. - Under the leadership of the great Stalin, this force is pointing towards the path of achieving universal peace and freeing us from bloody wars, that is, the path of overthrowing capitalist slavery, the path of the great progress of the whole world and the whole of mankind.

Experience has shown that the communist movement has developed to such a great and powerful extent in many countries that it can no longer be guided from one center. Here we can see one of the outstanding achievements of communism in our time. At the same time, experience has also shown that the various communist parties, especially the most powerful parties in Europe, must have a joint organization through which to continuously exchange opinions and, when necessary, coordinate the actions of the various communist parties with mutual consent. This will help to promote the further development of the communist movement and strengthen its influence among the masses. The Bolshevik Party welcomes these mature measures of the various communist parties and wishes them success.

Thirty years ago, the Bolshevik Party was only a small part of the people. But the Party of Lenin and Stalin, with scientific correctness, determined the historical requirements that our country had matured, and gained strong support among the masses of the people; and the people, under the leadership of our Party, won the victory of the revolution.

Today, everyone can see the results of this socialist victory and its supreme international significance.

Today, the united forces of democracy and socialism in Europe and beyond are incomparably stronger than the opposing imperialist anti-democratic camp.

Capitalism has become an obstacle to human progress, and the unscrupulous policies of imperialism (which have caused two world wars) continue to be a major danger to all peace-loving countries in the world.

The great October Socialist Revolution has shown all countries in the world that the era of capitalism has come to an end, and a reliable path to universal peace and the great progress of all countries in the world has been opened up. The dying efforts of imperialism, whose foundations are shaking, cannot save capitalism from its increasingly approaching death.

The era in which we live is an era in which all roads lead to communism.

The great Lenin laid the foundation of the Soviet state and led our people on the road to socialism, ending the age-old system of man exploiting man. Lenin's path leads to the freedom and happiness of all countries in the world, to the freedom and happiness of mankind.

The great Stalin has been and is leading our people along the glorious road to communism.

Stalin's name is infinitely respected and loved by the peoples of all nations, that is the great symbol of the victorious Soviet Union, and the battle cry for the future of striving for human happiness.

Comrades, the Bolsheviks have been and will forever be the vanguard of their country, and the Soviet people are marching at the forefront of progressive humanity, filled with confidence in the noble goals of the October Revolution.

Long live the thirtieth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution!

Under the banner of Lenin, under the leadership of Stalin, advance towards the victory of communism! (End of full text)

　　莫斯科十月革命三十周年纪念大会上
    莫洛托夫发表重要演说　续完
    所有这一切事实，都表明美国帝国主义意欲利用某些国家的战后困难，以便在自命自封的美国领导权的掩盖下，强使他人接受其意志，并为美国的世界霸权开拓道路。
    这样做，决不能作为一种借口，来替下面的期望辩解，以为也许可能逃脱与日俱增的国内困难吧，也许可能防止深重的经济危机之袭来，和美国之日益分裂成为两大集团吧？（那两大集团就是：一方面是现在喧嚷得那么凶的帝国主义者集团，另一方面是民主集团与将来属于民主集团的人们。）
    帝国主义者的贪欲是永无止境的，他们为了达到自私的目的，已准备不仅把其他国家的权利和主权，而且也把自己国内的民主权利摧残在他们铁蹄之下。
    显然，法西斯德国——它摧毁民主力量而又不自量力地力图争夺世界霸权——的崩溃的教训，并没有被那些正盲目地为追求世界霸权的野心所驱使的人记在心里。今天，美国和英国的统治集团正为首率领着一个国际集团，目的就在于加强资本主义，并建立他们对其他国家的霸权。这两国家在国际事务上领导着帝国主义与反民主力量，且为欧洲若干国家著名的社会党领袖所积极支持。
    苏联政策所根据的原则恰恰相反，那就是尊重大小国家主权与不干涉他国内政的原则。
    美英帝国主义侵略政策实例之三：德国问题。
    就拿德国问题为例来说吧：
    假如美国和英国在战后时期也能遵守例如雅尔塔和波茨顿会议的民主原则的话，那末苏美英三国的合作现在也会得到良好的结果的，因为那些原则，曾经使同盟国对希特勒德国的作战和消灭法西斯主义的残余成为可能，并获得成就。但是美英背弃了这些民主原则，而且违反了共同通过的决定。这一点可以说到的，有下述各基本问题：如德国的民主重建与非军国主义化问题，及对遭受德国占领之国家的赔偿支付问题。由于英美战后政策的结果，德境英美占领区已合并为联合管理的地区，报界通称为“联合占领区”，这样就可以在那里片面和单独地不受四大占领强国都有代表参加的管制委员会的约束，而奉行英美的政策。实际上，我们在德国的代表现在只处理苏联占领区的问题。这也引起了只能使德国人民不安的情势，因为，由于英美政策的结果，就有了一个“联合占领区”，还有其他占领区，但是却没有了德国，没有了一个完整的德意志国家。苏联认为：雅尔塔及波茨顿会议，德国问题的决定，规定恢复德国为一完整的民主国家一点必须付诸实现。苏联方面充分认识到，“联合占领区”并不是德国，德国人民有权要求一个他们自己的国家，自然，这一国家必须是民主的，而且决不能造成对其他爱好和平国家之新的侵略的威胁。今天，有了一个英美的计划，他们掷给德境英美占领区人民几根骨头买住他们，这计划依靠过去的德国资本家（他们在不久以前还曾支持希特勒），并且借助于“联合占领区”及其鲁尔工业区，用以威胁那些对英美统治欧洲计划并不表现奴性的服从的国家。但是，这些对德国的冒险计划不会有任何好的结果，而且很自然的一定要被全欧洲民主人民所拒绝。这个德国的例子说明了目前英美的原则与苏联的原则相去得多么远，英美的原则是彻头彻尾明目张胆的帝国主义，而苏联则坚守民主的原则。
    苏联及世界民主人民团结起来，必能制止帝国主义的新的战争冒险。
    苏联及其他民主国家坚持在民主方针上的和平与国际合作的立场。在目前情况下，这要求欧洲及欧洲以外的一切反帝国主义及民主阵营的力量团结起来，以便建立一个不可摧毁的堡垒，阻止日益嚣张的帝国主义，阻止它的新侵略政策。如果民主力量团结起来，并且大胆地向帝国主义及其新战争的冒险的计划作斗争，它就能把全世界的人民团结成为一支强大的军队。这当然不可能为帝国主义所喜欢，因为帝国主义剥夺各族人民的民主权利并蹂躏各国主权的计划，是以胁诈和疯狂的冒险为根据的。
    在帝国主义阵营中，其不安与惊慌，正日益增长，因为每个人都看到，帝国主义脚下的基础已经动摇了，而民主与社会主义的力量却逐日在增强。帝国主义政策能够给全世界各国带来什么呢？只是更大的压迫，为大家痛恨的法西斯主义的复活，以及帝国主义的新的冒险而已。对于这一点，全世界人民必须睁眼看清，一切民主与反帝国主义的力量必须团结起来，粉碎帝国主义方面任何一个经济上奴役各国的计划和任何一个新的冒险。苏联的历史经验，证实了伟大列宁的话：“在人民中，大多数工人与农民已认识、感觉并且看到他们所保护的这种政权，即是劳动阶级的政权，和所保卫的事业的胜利，就保证他们与他们的子女能享受人类劳动所创造一切福利。这样的人民，是不可战胜的。”
    今天的任务是团结一切反帝国主义分子与人民民主力量，以生死攸关的共同利益，凝结成为一个强大的阵营，以反对帝国主义与反民主阵营及其奴役各国与耽溺于新的冒险的政策。同时，清醒地看一看，就会看到，现在耽溺于帝国主义的新冒险也就是把资本主义的命运作为危险的赌注。某些部长们和参议员们也许没有认识到这点。但是如果反帝国主义民主阵营团结它的力量，并能利用一切机会的话，那么他们就会迫使帝国主义者稍获理性些和稍知约束。可以断言，资本主义本身是并不愿意迅速没落的。
    苏联人民已具有新的精神结构，这是社会主义建设的最大成就。
    当伟大十月社会主义革命进入第三十一年之际，我满意地回顾我们所经历过的道路，瞻望前途，充满着信心。苏联的成就真是伟大的。社会主义已深深地渗入我们的整个生活中。在苏维埃时代，新的一代已经成长起来，他们正开始像鹰隼一样展翅欲飞。
    必须承认，我们革命最伟大的成就，就是作为苏维埃爱国志士的我国人民，其新的精神结构与智识的增长。这一点，对于全苏联各族人民、城市与乡村的居民、从事体力劳动的人们以及从事智力劳动的人们，实在无不如此。这确实是十月革命的最高成就，划时代意义的成就。今天的苏维埃人民，已不同于三十年前了。今天苏维埃人民的精神结构，首先就表现在对工作的自觉态度，把他们的工作当做具有重大社会意义的事情，当做对苏维埃国家之神圣的职责。今天在每个工厂里，都有着许多男女斯塔哈诺夫运动者。社会主义竞赛已经遍及所有集体农场。工人、集体农民、机关工作人员、工程师和技师、艺术家和科学家，所有的人都参加了社会主义竞赛。今天竞赛的规模和内容，足以表明苏维埃人民对待工作的态度已经达到了共产主义的水平。全国性的这种竞赛已使它成为提高劳动生产力的最重要的工具了。现在已经盛行了一种新的运动，这就是：个别的工人都保证要提前完成他们的年产计划以及整个的五年计划，这是战前所没有见过的。这一运动正在莫斯科、列宁格勒、顿巴斯以及全国各地飞跃地发展着，证明了男女劳动者的社会主义心理状态。但这仅是我国内提高劳动生产力许多有效方法的一种而已。
    今年，谷物生产计划已提前完成了。虽然谷物产区及机器的数量较战前为少，但国家仍将收到略等于战前最好年成时的谷物。这个成就乃是由于在共和国与共和国之间、边疆与边疆之间、州与州之间发展了那么广泛的社会主义竞赛，特别是由于整个集体农场以及集体农场里成千百万男女都积极参加。战争初期，我们曾有过很困难的时候，一直到我们适应新的条件，改造我们全部工作，才把困难克服。
    我们工人在后方的贡献，以及我们军队在前线的英雄主义（这在世界历史上是无与伦比的），都是高尚的苏维埃爱国主义的表现，这是我们战胜敌人的保证。目前，苏维埃爱国主义的高涨，就是目前我们苏维埃人民思想水平与精神发展的显著表现。
    苏联人民还要加强自我批评，肃清资本主义的思想残余。
    不可否认，人们思想中的资本主义残余是很顽强的。为着根除这些旧社会的残余，党经常以进行全面批评与自我批评的必要性提醒苏维埃人民，正是为此。另一方面，也不可否认，我们现在正有着巨大的机会来胜利地进行根除这些残余的斗争。
    我们人民的文化水平已在一切方面提高了，学生的数目，出版书籍的数目，与在群众中的教育工作，已达到任何其他国家无可比拟的程度。我们的知识分子，文化领域中的工作者，我们的科学家和我们的艺术家，思想上贯彻着前所未有的苏维埃爱国主义。现在最优秀的文学作品，都是那些自觉地与共产主义结成不可分离的思想联系的作家的手笔。在我国，共产主义激励着人民奔赴热情的劳动，英勇奋发，为国效劳，进行灌注着高尚思想的创造活动。
    在战争期间，国外资产阶级雇庸的文丐们竟敢预言说：当苏联人民在他们的军事行动中熟悉了西方文明和秩序时，当他们到过欧洲各京城和许多城市时，一旦回国，他们就会想到完全否定他们自己的国家。但是事实怎么样呢？复员的官兵一回国就开始以更大的热情增强他们的集体农场，在工厂与车间中推进社会主义竞赛，并站到苏维埃爱国者的最前列。
    我们大家并不是都已摆脱了对西方、对资本主义文明的阿谀崇拜。旧俄的统治阶级对于资本主义方面较高度地发展的欧洲国家，时常处于深深的精神上的依赖状态中，并不是无所谓的，这帮助了在旧知识阶层某些人士中培养奴性的心理错综、自卑感与对欧洲资产阶级国家的精神上依赖性。除非摆脱这些可耻的残余，就不能成为真正的苏维埃公民。
    这就是为什么我们苏维埃人民要以那样坚定的决心尽速消灭这些旧社会的残余、无情地批评所有一切对西方及其资本主义文化的阿谀崇拜的表现。
    你们该记得斯大林同志论苏联公民的具有历史意义的话：“从资本羁绊中解放出来的最低微的苏联公民，比起任何国外手持资本主义奴役制度枷锁的高级官僚都要高出一头。”我们苏维埃人民愈了解斯大林关于一个苏联公民的自觉性与光荣的要求的话，那末我们向着我们伟大的目标也就迈进得愈快。
    马克斯列宁主义的思想，在这整个三十年中，像晴空的太阳一样，照耀着我们的道路。
    资本主义已濒死亡，苏联人民引导全世界朝着共产主义的胜利前进！
    我们的进展是建筑在列宁、斯大林的战略与策略基础上的。我们的道路不是一条平易的道路，外部和内部的敌人曾经是非常嚣张，甚至在布尔塞维克党内部敌人也还有他的代理人，这就是如托洛茨基匪徒、右派分子及其他卖国叛徒与叛变分子等。列宁、斯大林所创立的布尔塞维克党，在经历了这一切考验之后，力量加强了，党的队伍纯洁了，而且已凝炼成为一支强大的力量。这就是我国人民精神与政治团结的最高体现——我国人民正充满着信心，向着共产主义社会前进。——这一力量在伟大斯大林领导下，正指向达到普遍和平与解脱流血战争的道路，也就是推翻资本主义奴役制度的道路，全世界全人类伟大进步的道路。
    经验已经显示：共产主义运动在许多国家中已经发展到这样巨大和有力的程度，以致已再也不能从一个中心来指导它了。在这里，我们就可以看到我们这时代中共产主义的卓越成就之一。同时，经验也已显示：各个共产党、特别是欧洲共产党中最强大的党，必须有一个联合的机构，通过它来不断交换意见，必要时在互相同意下，配合各个共产党的行动。这将有助于促使共产主义运动的进一步发展，并加强它在群众中的影响。布尔塞维克党欢呼各个共产党这些成熟的措施，并祝他们成功。
    三十年前，布尔塞维克党不过是人民中的一小部分。但是列宁、斯大林的党，以科学的正确性，确定了我国业已成熟了历史要求，在人民群众中获得了强有力的支持；而人民在我们党的领导下，赢得了革命的胜利。
    今天，每一个人都能看到这个社会主义胜利的成果，及其最高的国际意义。
    今天，欧洲以及欧洲以外民主与社会主义团结的力量合在一起，比起对方的帝国主义反民主阵营来，已强大得不能比拟了。
    资本主义已成为人类进步的障碍，帝国主义肆无忌惮的政策（它已引起了两次世界大战）继续下去，就是全世界爱好和平各国的重大危险。
    伟大十月社会主义革命已经使全世界各国看到：资本主义的时代已经日暮途穷，到达普遍和平与全世界各国伟大进步的可靠道路已经洞开了。基础正在动摇的帝国主义的拼死努力，决不能把资本主义从它日益逼近的死亡中挽救出来。
    我们所处的时代，正是条条道路都通到共产主义的时代。
    伟大列宁奠定了苏维埃国家的基础，并领导我们的人民走向社会主义的道路，结束了年代悠久的人削剥人的制度。列宁的道路导向世界各国的自由与幸福，导向人类的自由与幸福。
    伟大斯大林曾经并正在领导我们的人民沿着光荣的道路走向共产主义。
    斯大林的名字为各民族人民所无限地尊敬和热爱，那是胜利的苏联的伟大象征，是争取人类幸福的前途的战斗号声。
    同志们，布尔塞维克党人曾经而且将永久是他们国家的先锋队，苏联人民在进步人类的最前列行进，充满着对于十月革命的高尚目标的信心。
    伟大十月社会主义革命三十周年万岁！
    在列宁的旗帜下、在斯大林的领导下，向共产主义的胜利前进！（全文完）
