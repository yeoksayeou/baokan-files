　　【Taiyue, this paper, 10th】"Truly our family," this is the glorious title presented to the ×th sanatorium directly under the military region by the discharged wounded soldiers. They not only praised the work of the staff members verbally, but also helped the staff members. On one occasion, all the wounded and sick soldiers proposed that the staff members take a day off, but the unit refused. However, more than seventy slightly wounded soldiers voluntarily walked out of the ward to cook for the cooks and take care of the seriously wounded. Some even carried lanterns at night to help the nurses fetch meals. Recently, all the wounded and sick soldiers donated 40,000 yuan to慰劳 the staff. The reason why the staff of the sanatorium is loved by all the wounded and sick soldiers is that all the staff members love the wounded soldiers and provide thorough treatment. First of all, Director Xu would rush into the ward as soon as he got up, and would not eat until noon. Instructor Yang always hurriedly ate his meal, put down his bowl, and went to take care of the patients. Nurse Wan Gengzhong bathed the wounded soldiers, and when he saw that the wounded soldiers' quilts were torn, he gave his own quilt to the wounded soldiers, took it off and washed it, and tore his own bundle to mend it. Other general male and female doctors and nurses patiently cared for the sick and wounded, as if they were their own relatives.

　　伤员的家
    【本报太岳十日电】“真是我们的家庭”，这是军区直属第×所出院伤员所赠于该所的光荣称号。他们不仅在口头上赞颂工作人员的功劳，并且还帮助工作人员。某一次全体伤病员提出让工作人员休息一天，被所部拒绝了。但轻伤员七十余人自动走出病房，替炊事员做饭，看护重彩号，有些夜间自动的提着灯笼帮助看护打饭。最近全体伤病员又捐出四万元来慰劳工作人员。该所工作人员所以获得全体伤病员的爱戴，是因为全所人员爱护伤员及治疗周到。首先是徐所长每天一起床就跑进病房直至晌午才吃饭。杨教导员每顿饭皆是急急忙忙的吃了放下碗就去照料病人。看护万根重给伤员洗了澡，看伤员被子烂了，便将自己的被子给伤员盖上，替下来拆洗了，又扯了自己的包袱给补好。其余一般的男女医生看护，都是耐心的看护伤病员，好似自己的亲人。
