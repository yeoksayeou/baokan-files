    Taihang Second Military Sub-district Troops
    Help Harvest Thousands of Acres During Combat Breaks
    [This dispatch] The Taihang Second Military Sub-district troops, while protecting the masses in distributing the autumn harvest and land, also helped the masses with the autumn harvest. The Third Company, in five days, helped harvest 1,066 acres. Under the slogan of "Protecting the grain is protecting victory," they are determined to render meritorious service to the people in protecting the autumn harvest and strive to become autumn harvest models. The hero class of the First Company harvested only 13.5 acres in half a day and helped the masses harvest without eating lunch in Qiaotou Village. Comrade Pang Yunxing, a hero with military and political skills in the sub-district, organized autumn harvest mutual aid groups, mobilized classes and groups to compete with each other to see who could cut the fastest and best. He led seven people and cut more than 19 acres in four hours. The Third Company harvested 88 acres on the first day and 138 acres on the second day. They used bayonets instead of knives to cut sorghum. After the Wangxiang battle, the enemy dared not come out in small groups to conduct activities. After two successful ambushes in Taigu, the First Company shattered the enemy's grain robbery plan. The enemy in Guojiabao did not dare to live in the strongholds at night, and the south gate of Taigu city was also closed, and they did not dare to move for several days. According to incomplete statistics, in the Dongxi Jingshen area alone, more than 300 acres of autumn harvest have been protected for the masses. (Zijiang)
    [This dispatch from] Taiyue, 29th [of the month] The Taiyue District Party Committee, Military Region, Xinhua Daily, Administrative Office and other 17 directly affiliated units, starting from the 12th [of the month], dispatched a total of 343 people and 16 head of livestock to help military dependents, revolutionary martyrs' families, disabled veterans, war participants, and poor, widowed, orphaned and childless people in 16 villages including Nanguan, Xiguan, and Pingtou with harvesting and planting. In the past seven days, they have planted 238 acres of wheat, harvested more than 1,000 acres of crops, carried 7,000 loads of manure, and done other miscellaneous tasks such as plowing and digging. The labor enthusiasm is very high. Comrades from the District Party Committee said: "When we are doing work, we feel that we are not helping the folks, but doing it for ourselves." They also said: "This is harvesting counter-offensive grain, how important it is." Therefore, everyone worked with great effort. Comrades from the Secretariat Section of Xinhua Daily carried manure when they went and carried corn when they came back, carrying 27 loads of manure and 15 loads of corn in one afternoon. The students from the Finance and Economics Team of the Administrative Office Cadre School continued to carry even when their shoulders were broken. Comrades from the Trade Company were still harvesting in the rain while the folks were going back home. The Expedition Team prepared their own food and drink when they went to other villages to help with the harvest, and immediately compensated for any damage to the people's furniture at the market price. Comrades from the Trade Company plowed the land behind the ridge and immediately compensated the people 300 yuan for breaking a plowshare. In addition, they also used meal breaks to publicize the victory of the great counter-offensive to the masses. The masses said with a smile: "This is really the army of the people, doing whatever they are asked to do. They are really efficient, doing whatever they are asked to do. They plant crops in the spring, harvest wheat in the summer, and harvest autumn and plant wheat in the autumn." The village chief of Xiguan Village said: "This has really helped us a lot. We plan to plant 800 acres of wheat, but everyone has no confidence, saying that there is too much grass in this year's land and it is too much work. Our village only has 20 head of livestock in the mill, and it will take more than 20 days just to plow the land. We are afraid that planting 300 more acres will not be possible, but now it is solved." When the autumn harvest teams of various agencies returned, the masses thanked them repeatedly. The masses of Xiakong Village presented the autumn harvest team of the District Party Committee with a silk banner, which read "People's Adoration."

    太行二分区部队
    战斗空隙助收千亩
    【本报讯】太行二分区部队一面掩护群众分秋分田，一面帮助群众秋收，三中队在五天中即助收一○六六亩。他们在“保卫了粮食，就是保卫了胜利”的口号下，都下决心要在保卫秋收中为人民立功，争取秋收模范。一连英雄班半天内仅收了十三亩半，在桥头村不吃午饭帮助群众收割。分区军政双全的功臣庞运兴同志，组织秋收互助组，发动班组互相竞赛，看谁割得最快最好，他率领七个人，四个钟头便割了十九亩多。三连第一天收了八十八亩，第二天就割了一三八亩，割高粱没有刀用刺刀代替，王香战斗后，敌人不敢再小股出来活动。一中队在太谷两次胜利伏击后，将敌抢粮计划打得粉碎，郭家堡敌人晚上已不敢在据点内住，太谷城南门也封闭了，好几天不敢出动。据不完全统计，仅在东西井神一带，已掩护群众秋收三百余亩。（资江）
    【本报太岳二十九日电】太岳区党委、军区、新华日报社、行署等十七个直属单位，从十二日起，共抽三百四十三人，十六头牲口帮助南关、西关、坪头等十六个村的军、烈属、荣军、参战人员，贫雇鳏寡孤独收种，七天来共种麦二百三十八亩，收割庄稼一千余亩，担粪七千余担，及其他杂活，盘茬、刨地等。劳动情绪非常高涨，区党委机关的同志说：“我们在做活的时候，觉得不是帮助老乡，而是给自己干哩。”又说：“这是收割反攻粮，多么重要呀。”因此大家万分紧张出力。新华日报社秘书科同志，去时担粪，回来时担玉茭，一下午就担了二十七担粪，十五担玉茭。行署干校财经队的学员，把肩膀担破了还在担。贸易公司的同志，天下着雨，老乡都往回走，他们还在收割。远征队出外村助收，吃喝自备，损坏群众家具，立时照市价赔偿，贸易公司的同志在岭后犁地，打坏了一个铧马上赔了老百姓三百元。此外还利用吃饭休息时间，向群众宣传大反攻胜利，群众笑着说：“真是老百姓的军队，要做啥就给做啥，真奏手，挨着做啥就做啥，春天种庄稼，夏天割麦子，秋天又收秋种麦。”西关村长说：“这一下可给咱们顶了大事了，咱们计划种八百亩麦子，大家没信心，说今年的地草太多费手，咱村连磨坊的牲口才有二十头，光犁地就得二十多天，多种三百亩还怕不成，这下就解决了。”当各机关秋收队返回时，群众纷纷道谢不止，下孔村群众送给区党委机关秋收队锦旗一面，上写“人民的爱戴者”。
