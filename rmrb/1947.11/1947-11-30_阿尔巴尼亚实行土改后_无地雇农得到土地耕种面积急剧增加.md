　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 26th: Tirana dispatch: On the 17th, Albania celebrated the second anniversary of the promulgation of the Land Reform Law with national festivities. Before the land reform, 53.6 percent of Albania's arable land was owned by large landowners, farmers owned only 26.07 percent of the land, the remaining land was owned by the royal family, and 20,121 farm households had no land at all. In the two years since the land reform, 82,881 households, nearly half of the country's total population, have been allocated land. The total land redistributed reached 333,215 hectares. Now, 43.71 percent of the country's arable land is owned by farmers, and land obtained by formerly landless tenant farmers accounts for 36.65 percent of the country's cultivated land. The most remarkable achievement of the land reform is the sharp increase in cultivated area. This spring, the cultivated area reached 306,414 hectares, an increase of nearly 80 percent compared with 186,177 hectares before the war in 1938. This fact guarantees that Albania's agriculture has recovered and surpassed pre-war levels in less than two years (i.e., in the first half of this year).

　　阿尔巴尼亚实行土改后
  　无地雇农得到土地耕种面积急剧增加
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】地拉那讯：十七日，阿尔巴尼亚全国狂欢庆祝土地改革法颁行二周年纪念。在土改以前，全阿耕地有百分之五十三点六为大地主所有，农民所有之土地仅占百分之二十六点零七，其余土地为皇族所有，有二万零一百二十一户农民根本没有土地。土改二年以来，已有八万二千八百八十一户，即几占全国总人口二分之一的农民分到了土地。重分配的土地达三十三万三千二百一十五公顷。现在，全国百分之四十三点七一的耕地已归农民所有，以前无地的雇农得地占全国耕地百分之三十六点六五。土改最惊人的成绩，是耕种面积的急剧增加。今年春天，耕种面积达三十万六千四百一十四公顷，较战前一九三八年之十八万六千一百七十七公顷，增加几达百分之八十。这一事实保证了阿国农业在二年不到的时间内（即在今年上半年）即已恢复并超过战前水平。
