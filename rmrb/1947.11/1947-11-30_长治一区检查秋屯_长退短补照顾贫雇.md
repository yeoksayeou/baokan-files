　　Changzhi First District Inspects Autumn Grain Collection
  　Long-Term Refunds and Short-Term Supplements to Care for Poor Hired Labor
    [Our Newspaper, Changzhi News] The Changzhi First District held a meeting on the 16th with more than 400 cadres and activists to inspect the burden of grain collection. Many confused thoughts were discovered, such as cadres fearing trouble, old middle peasants fearing the overturning and redoing of work, and cadres being too embarrassed to break with relationships. After mobilization at the meeting, the issues of checking class status, checking grain production, checking income, and checking care were raised, encouraging everyone to patiently calculate accounts, and explaining that old middle peasants have a foundation, while newly emancipated households are weak, and more care should be given in terms of burden. Guo Renzi from Shanmen Village said: "In our village, the assessors are all middle peasants, so the assessment of grain production is unfair. The grain production of first-class land is raised to two dan, and most of the middle peasants plant medium-grade land, but the grain production is not raised, in fact, the grain production of medium-grade land is almost the same as our first-class land. Four or five emancipated households share a head of livestock, a cart, and incomplete tools. To get them complete, they have to spend millet to buy them, while middle peasants have livestock, carts, and horses, and they have ways to manage. Anyway, we can't catch up with them." Some cadres said that the targets of struggle were benefiting too much, profiting from production dividends and earning wage rice in mutual aid. In Yuzhuang Village, the targets of struggle earned more than 1,000 jin of rice in the mutual aid group, without bearing the burden or performing corvée labor, living more comfortably than middle peasants. The broken-down landlords who benefit on both ends were also like this. After review, it was decided that cadres throughout the district would go to the countryside to conduct a major inspection of the grain collection burden, implement long-term refunds and short-term supplements, and truly achieve fairness and rationality.

　　长治一区检查秋屯
  　长退短补照顾贫雇
    【本报长治讯】长治一区于十六日召开四百余干部积极分子会议检查负担，发现了许多糊涂思想，如干部怕麻烦、老中农怕推翻重新搞，和干部不好意思打不破情面等。经大会动员，提出查阶级、查产粮、查收入、查照顾，让大家耐心的算算帐，并说明老中农有基础，新翻身户底虚，应该在负担上多照顾。山门村郭仁仔说：“我村在负担中，评议员都是中农，所以评议产粮时不公平。头等地产粮提高到二石，中农种的大部分是中等地，但产粮不往上提，实际上人家中等地和咱头等地比起产粮差不多。翻身户四五户分了一头牲口、车和家伙不全，想弄全就得花小米去买，人家中农牲口车马俱全，到那也有办法，咱反正赶不上人家”。有的干部说斗争对象讨便宜太大，钻在生产部分红利，在互助中赚工资米，余庄村斗争对象在互助组就赚了一千多斤米，不出负担，不支差，比中农生活还舒服，两头赶上的破落地主也是这样。经过检讨，决定全区干部分头下乡，进行负担大检查，实行长退短补，真正做到公正合理。（玉明、尧圃、振山、子才）
