Li Gou Village Diligently Learns Textile Weaving

Li Gou Village is a mountain village in Jincheng, consisting of five natural villages with 348 households and 1,382 people. With limited land, their living expenses mainly depend on the income from fruit trees. In the past, the women did not know how to spin and weave, making it very difficult to change clothes with the seasons. This year, everyone overcame various difficulties and learned to spin and weave, and the whole village put on new clothes. The process of their learning to spin and weave:

　　　　(1) Four Requests

Because of the difficulty in getting clothes and the shortage of grain, and the inability to exchange grain for cloth, the peasant association members voiced their opinions the winter before last, wanting to start textile production. Everyone contributed shares, 100 yuan per person, raising 4,600 yuan in Li Gou Village first. They made one loom and nine spinning wheels, bought ten catties of cotton, and asked the women to learn to spin thread. But no one had spun before and couldn't draw the thread. The capital was used up, and no thread was spun, so they had to stop. Last spring, everyone made a second request to start textile production. This time there were more members, raising a total of 30,000 yuan. The women also made up their minds. Twenty or thirty people learned to spin thread, but they didn't know how to weave and couldn't find a teacher, so the thread couldn't be turned into cloth. They stopped again. The third time, the masses requested to find a teacher first. At this time, Wang Tongsheng, the manager of the cooperative, looked for a teacher everywhere. He didn't find one until June. But this teacher was a mediocre one, who was anxious on the loom but couldn't weave cloth. With effort until the autumn harvest, they managed to weave three or four pieces of cloth. The teacher didn't need to be told and resigned on his own.

After the autumn harvest, each household harvested some cotton, and again requested for the fourth time to engage in textile production. This time, they succeeded. The success was entirely due to bringing in a group of soldiers.

　　　　(2) Six Trips to "Recruit Troops"

When the district cooperative held a meeting in Xiao Dong Gou Village to arrange textile production, it said that many family members of Meng County cadres lived in Tuhe, and most of them knew how to weave. They could be invited to teach in villages without weaving teachers. They were very happy to hear this, so Wang Tongsheng and another village cadre went to Tuhe to invite teachers. But as soon as Li Gou Village was mentioned, those cadre families were reluctant to go up the mountains, disliking the unfamiliar place and people. They had to come back and discuss a solution with the masses. They first organized a visit to express their regards, bringing vegetables and other gifts. They went every other day, slowly becoming familiar with them. On the fifth trip, they proposed the matter of teaching weaving, guaranteeing that if they came to Li Gou Village, there would be no difficulties in housing and meals, and oil, salt, vegetables, and coal would be guaranteed. The cadre families agreed, and the village cadres first returned to prepare houses, flour, and vegetables. The next day, all the village cadres, militiamen, women, children, and the self-defense team went out of the village with red flags, beating gongs and drums, and lined up to welcome them. Some went to pick up luggage, and some took quilts. The whole village welcomed them into the village like they were welcoming a bride. These six trips to "recruit troops" finally brought in the teachers.

　　　　(3) Separated into Five Villages

Because of the warm welcome and cordial treatment in Li Gou, the Meng County cadre families were touched. The next morning, Lao Jia and his wife gathered the cadre families who had come and asked for everyone's opinions. No one said there were any difficulties, and everyone said they were willing to go separately. One said they would teach the women well, and another said they would be letting people down if they couldn't teach them. After talking for a while, Lao Jia proposed that after being separated, they should meet together every ten days or half a month to discuss with each other, and everyone was satisfied. After the meeting, Lao Jia discussed with the Li Gou cadres and divided the forty-odd cadre families who had come to Li Gou, Houhe, Duan Yu, Bei Ling, and Geda Po, according to the situation of each natural village.

After arriving in the natural villages, each village had another warm welcome and reception. Each village held a general meeting of women to mobilize everyone to study hard, and organized carpenters to rush to make spinning wheels and looms to prepare for large-scale textile production.

　　　　(4) A Hundred People Learned

The Meng County cadre families were determined to teach, and the Li Gou women were determined to learn. It was like twisting two strands of hemp rope together, truly uniting their strength. Teaching was good and learning was fast. In less than a month, several people in each village had learned. In teaching weaving, the Meng County cadre families completely lacked the attitude of teachers in the old society. They patiently taught everyone, talking and laughing with the women in each village, like close sisters. They said, "One good leads to two good, you are good and I am better," unconsciously forming a "respect teacher and love student" movement. Lao Jia's daughter-in-law, in addition to teaching weaving, also taught women to read, posting three or five new characters on the loom every day to teach the women to learn to recognize them. Lao Jia's wife was even more active. In addition to teaching in Li Gou village itself, she also went to Bei Ling, Geda Po, Duan Yu, and Houhe to help with work. By the twelfth lunar month, the whole village held a meeting to summarize that the number of textile women had increased to 258 in one winter, and 83 women had learned to weave. They spun 1,143 catties of thread and wove 18,240 feet of cloth. The great difficulty of changing clothes in winter was solved. Everyone knew this was thanks to the Meng County cadre families. During the New Year, each family sent white flour, vegetables, pork, etc. to these cadre families... They sent too much, and no family could eat it all. After the New Year, the textile production in each village was carried out vigorously again. This time, more than 100 people learned, and every family was busy non-stop.

　　　　(5) A Thousand People Change Clothes with the Seasons

Half a year later, Li Gou Village had undergone a great change. Every courtyard could weave, and everyone could spin. Statistics from this spring alone showed that more than 2,000 bolts of cloth were woven. Duan Jia Village was the best, weaving more than 900 bolts of cloth. The woven cloth was almost like foreign cloth.

### 李沟村苦心学纺织

　　李沟村苦心学纺织
    李沟村是晋城的一个山村，由五个自然村组成，全村有三百四十八户，一千三百八十二口人，土地不多，其生活费用主要的要靠种植果木的收入。过去妇女不会纺织，换季十分困难，今年大家突破了各种困难，学会了纺织，全村都穿上了新衣服。她们学习纺织的经过：
    　　　　（一）四次要求
    因穿衣困难粮食又少，也不能用粮换布，前年冬天，农会会员提出意见，要办纺织，大家来摊股金，每人出洋一百元，先在李沟村集了四千六百元，做了布机一架、纺车九辆，买了十斤棉花，叫妇女学纺线，但大家都没纺过，抽不出线来，本钱用完了，也没纺成线，只好停止不干。去年春天，大家又提第二次意见，要办纺织，这次会员多了，共集洋三万元，妇女也下了决心，有二、三十个人，都学会了纺线，但不会织，找不上老师，线变不成布。又停止了。第三次群众要求先找老师，这时合作社经理王通生，就四下找老师，一直找到六月，才算找到个老师。但这老师是个半把手，上到机上乾急织不出布，努力到秋收时，才把按上的三、四匹布对付织下来，这老师不用人说，自己也就推辞不干了。
    秋收后，各家都收了些棉花，又四次要求再搞纺织，这次算是搞成了。怎样搞成的，全靠搬来了一股兵。
    　　　　（二）六趟搬兵
    区联社在小东沟村开会布置纺织时说，土河住着不少孟县干部家属，大都会织布，那村没织布老师可请他们来教。他们听了很高兴，于是王通生同另一村干部就去土河请老师，但一提出来李沟村，那些干属们实次上山，人家嫌人地生疏不愿来。他们只好回来，和群众又研究了办法，先组织去慰问，并带有蔬菜等慰劳品，就这样隔一天一趟，隔一天一趟，慢慢熟惯了，第五趟才提出教织布的事，并保证人家来到李沟村，不论住房吃饭，油盐菜炭保证没有困难。这样干属们同意了，村干部又先回来准备了房子、面、菜，第二天全村干部、民兵、妇女、儿童和自卫队都出了村扛上红旗，打着锣鼓，排队欢迎，有的前去接行李，有的拿上铺盖，全村人象迎亲样的迎进了村，这六趟“搬兵”总算请来了老师。
    　　　　（三）五村分开
    因为李沟的热烈欢迎和亲切优待，孟县干属受了感动，过了一夜，一早起来老贾便和他老婆召集所来的干属开会，征求大家的意见，谁也说没啥困难，谁也说愿意分开去，这个说要好好教人家妇女，那个说教不会就对不起人家，谈了一阵，老贾又提出分下去以后，你们十天半月到一块开一次会，互相谈谈，大家都满意，会后老贾就和李沟干部研究，按各自然村的情况，把来的四十几个干属分到李沟、后河、段峪、北岭、疙瘩坡五村去了。
    到自然村以后，各村又是一番热烈的欢迎与招待。各村都召开全体妇女大会，进行动员，叫大家努力学习，又把木匠组织起来，赶作纺车和布机，准备大纺织。
    　　　　（四）百人学会
    孟县干属下了决心去教，李沟妇女下了决心来学，好比是两股麻绳往一块扭，真合劲。教的好学的快，不上一月，各村都有几个人学会了。在教织布当中，孟县干属完全没有过去旧社会那种当老师的态度，她们一个一个都是耐心去教，和各村妇女在一起说笑着，如同亲姊妹一样，她们说：“一好合两好，你好我更好，”无形中形成一种“敬师爱徒”运动。老贾的儿媳妇，除教织布外，还教妇女识字，每天在机子上贴上三、五个生字，教妇女学认。老贾老婆更积极，除在李沟本村教了，还到北岭、疙瘩坡、段峪、后河去帮助工作。到了腊月，全村开会，总结一冬天纺妇增加到二百五十八名，八十三个妇女学会织布；纺线一千一百四十三斤，织布一万八千二百四十尺，冬季换季的大困难解决了，谁都知道这是孟县干属的功劳，过年时各家都给这些干属家送去白面、蔬菜、猪肉等……，送的太多，那家也吃不了。过了年，各村的纺织又是轰轰烈烈的搞开了，这次学会的就有一百多人了，那一家也是忙的不停。
    　　　　（五）千人换季
    半年以后，李沟村大变了样，院院能织，人人会纺，仅今春统计，共织布两千余匹，段贾村最好，织布在九百匹以上，织出的布差不多和洋布一样。
