    Thirty Years of Soviet Construction
    Li Shenzhi
    On November 7, 1917, the socialist state called the Soviet Union appeared for the first time on one-sixth of the world's land. Mr. Sun Yat-sen called it giving "humanity a great hope."
    Thirty years of history have proved that the Soviet Union deserves such praise. It has liberated mankind from the most cruel and devastating wars, rescued civilization from the threat of returning to barbarism, and become the most reliable and solid pillar of human peace and happiness.
    It is no accident that a country that was considered a "difficult to believe, backward country" (Lenin) thirty years ago can achieve its current status. This is only possible if a country has greatly changed not only its political organization but also its economic structure, and increased its productivity five to tenfold. What the Soviet Union accomplished in thirty years was this great task, and its thirty-year history is a construction history interwoven with arduous struggle and brilliant achievements.
    In February 1942, in his election speech, Stalin compared the main industrial and agricultural output of Tsarist Russia in 1913 (the year before World War I) with the output of the Soviet Union in 1940 (the year before the German invasion of the Soviet Union), pointing out that in 1913, Russia produced 4.22 million tons of pig iron, 4.23 million tons of steel, 29 million tons of coal, 9 million tons of oil, 21.6 million tons of grain, and 740,000 tons of cotton. In 1940, the Soviet Union produced 15 million tons of pig iron, three times more than in 1913; 18.3 million tons of steel, three and a half times more than in 1913; 166 million tons of coal, four and a half times more than in 1913; 31 million tons of oil, two and a half times more than in 1913; 38 million tons of grain, 17 million tons more than in 1913; and 2 million tons of cotton, two and a half times more than in 1913. These figures eloquently illustrate the enormous efforts made by the Soviet Union to resist and defeat Germany.
    In terms of total industrial output, the Soviet Union in 1940 increased twelvefold compared to Tsarist Russia in 1913. This is an astonishing figure. However, the Soviet Union did not start construction from the industrial level of 1913, but after World War I and the Civil War, when the White Army and foreign intervention forces greatly damaged the Russian industrial base, which is even more shocking. At that time, the Soviet Union's industry was only one-seventh of that of 1913, and it had actually regressed to the era of Peter the Great, lagging behind industrial powers such as the United States, Britain, Germany, and France by 250 years. Therefore, in terms of the real speed of industrial development, the Soviet Union increased its industrial production by 84 times in less than 20 years before 1940, becoming the country with the fastest production speed in the world, a figure unprecedented in human history.
    In contrast, during the same period (1913-1940), the United States, the capitalist country with the fastest industrial development, increased its production by less than one time. For example, if the production index of major industrial countries in 1929, when the Soviet Union started its first Five-Year Plan, is set at 100, then by 1938, when the Soviet Union completed its second Five-Year Plan, the United States was 70, Britain was 112, Germany was 125, France was 70, and the Soviet Union was 477. In 1940, Germany, Britain, and France were already involved in the war, and the United States slightly increased to 111, while the Soviet Union increased to 534. In this year, the Soviet Union's industrial production exceeded that of Germany, Britain, and France and ranked first in Europe and second in the world.
    As early as 1931, Stalin pointed out: "We are fifty to one hundred years behind the advanced countries. We should complete this journey in ten years. If we cannot do this, we will be eliminated." Exactly ten years later, the most terrifying war fell on the Soviet Union, but it was not eliminated. It was its enemies who were eliminated. It had completed a hundred years of journey in ten years, "completed two hundred and fifty years of journey in one year, and even surpassed it." (American writer William Mandel)
    The Soviet Union has also made great achievements in agriculture. In 1940, almost all Soviet farmland was collectivized, with more than 240,000 collective farms, more than 4,000 state farms, more than 7,000 tractor stations, 530,000 tractors, 182,000 transport trucks, and 275,000 kilowatts of electricity for rural use. These things were almost non-existent in 1913. The sown area increased from 105 million hectares in 1913 to 124 million hectares, grain production increased by 1.6 times, exports increased by 2 times, and the output of industrial crops such as cotton, flax, sugar beets, and sunflowers increased by at least 2 to 4 times. Like industrial production, these figures illustrate a record-breaking speed.
    In this way, the Soviet Union became an agricultural and industrial power. Only the United States in the world has the same economic status. The main reason why the Soviet Union's industry and agriculture developed so rapidly, as Stalin pointed out: "This unprecedented development cannot be regarded as the usual development of a country from backwardness to progress. It is a leap from a backward country to a progressive country." Stalin also pointed out that this leap was only possible because the Bolsheviks first developed the two major policies of heavy industry and agricultural collectivization. And this policy was only possible because the Soviet Union was a socialist country. In such a country, all banks and heavy industries are nationalized, making it possible for a poor and backward country to raise the huge funds necessary for the development of heavy industry at once, without having to take the century-long journey of capitalist countries accumulating military industrial funds from the profits of light industry. Only in such a country can the working class and peasantry truly grasp political power, enabling a small-peasant country with scattered and backward production to obtain modern large-scale farming agricultural machinery and equipment, complete collectivization, and become a new type of large-scale agriculture with high productivity, avoiding the inevitable tragic situation of capitalist countries bankrupting millions of peasants in order to achieve large-scale agricultural production.
    Thus, the establishment of heavy industry and agricultural collectivization, which the Soviet Union basically completed in the first Five-Year Plan, proved to be a great victory for socialism. Because of heavy industry, the Soviet Union obtained the basis for industrial independence. Because of the collectivization of agriculture, the rapidly developing industry of the Soviet Union obtained the raw materials, grain, and necessary personnel separated due to the increase in labor productivity, which could only be supplied by modern large farms.
    The Soviet-German war tested the power of Soviet construction and proved that "the Soviet system is the best social system compared to non-Soviet systems." (Stalin)
    According to Soviet government statistics, the damage inflicted on the Soviet Union by the Hitler bandits was as follows: 1,700 towns were burned, including the largest industrial centers of the Soviet Union such as Stalingrad, Leningrad, Sevastopol, Kharkov, Kiev...etc., 70,000 villages, 32,000 factories where 4 million people worked, and 98,000 collective farms were destroyed, with a total loss of 670 billion rubles, 7 million people sacrificed their lives (approximately equal to the total population of Australia), and 25 million people were homeless: "The place where the Germans retreated is like a desert." According to the estimates of the Hitler bandits after the completion of the destruction, it would take at least 25 years to rebuild and restore the original state, "No other social and national system can withstand this military and economic test (Voznesensky: Five-Year Plan Report)."
    But even under such circumstances: "The industry in the rear of the Soviet Union not only continued to work, but also supplemented new factories and enterprises" (Molotov). During the four years of the war, the industrial production in the Ural region increased by 3.6 times, the Siberian region increased by 2.8 times, and the Volga region increased by 3.4 times. These newly built industries in the eastern Soviet Union not only produced enough aircraft and artillery for the front lines during the war, but also greatly expanded the industrial base of the Soviet Union, making it widely distributed throughout the vast territory of the Soviet Union, providing more favorable conditions for further development.
    The continued expansion of Soviet industry during the war laid a good foundation for the industrial demobilization and reconstruction after the war. In 1946, only one year after the end of the war, the Soviet Union had basically completed its demobilization, and the production of civilian goods increased by 20% compared to 1945, with its value increasing by 18.4 billion rubles. At the same time, capitalist countries began to shrink production and fell into universal depression and crisis. In 1946, the industrial production of the United States decreased by one-third compared to the war, and the number of unemployed people reached 3 million according to official announcements. However, the Soviet Union "did not know what unemployment was. Due to the return of a large number of soldiers to the production sector, the Soviet Union did not close a single factory. In the Soviet Union, the transition from war to peace not only did not shrink production, but greatly expanded it" (Zhdanov). In this year, less than five months after the end of the war, the Soviet Union started a new fourth Five-Year Plan.
    The purpose of the ongoing Five-Year Plan is to fully restore the pre-war production level in the first three years, and to increase the industrial production level by 48% and agriculture by 27% compared to the pre-war level in the following two years; that is to say, by 1950, the Soviet Union will produce 19.5 million tons of pig iron, 25.4 million tons of steel, 250 million tons of coal, 35.4 million tons of oil, and 127 million tons of grain. And the number of mother machines and lathes that manufacture all machines will be increased to 1.3 million, which is 30% more than that of the United States in 1940. This plan has been 100% completed in its first year of implementation. Although it is not possible to have final figures this year, according to current statistics, it has not only been completed but also exceeded the plan by 3%, and the production has increased by 18% compared to the same period last year. Moreover, the vast majority of workers in the Soviet Union responded to the call of the workers in Leningrad to complete the annual plan before the 30th anniversary of the October Revolution. Therefore, there is no doubt that the fourth plan will be completed in 1950 or even ahead of schedule.
    However, the Soviet Union is not satisfied with this. As early as six months after the end of the war, Stalin set the goal of making the Soviet Union's production three to four times higher than before the war in fifteen years; that is, producing: 50 million tons of pig iron, 60 million tons of steel, 500 million tons of coal, and 60 million tons of oil. Stalin pointed out: "Only under this condition can it be considered that our motherland has a guarantee against unexpected attacks." This means that by 1960, the Soviet Union's industrial production will catch up with the United States, which now accounts for more than half of the world's industrial production, and rank first in the world.
    This is a major event with decisive significance for the fate of mankind. The Soviet Union's industry exceeding the United States means that the forces of world peace and democracy have an inviolable absolute advantage. This means that mankind will truly and finally be permanently liberated from the threat of war. This means the beginning of a new era of peace, stability, prosperity and abundance.
    Even the most reactionary enemies of the Soviet Union, in view of the failures of speculation in the past thirty years, dare not express doubt about this incredible grand plan. That is why warmongers like Bullitt are exclaiming: "Time is on the Soviet side!" Because they know that the Soviet Union is the richest country in the world in terms of resources, and less than one-tenth of them have been exploited, while the United States will be exhausted in another ten years. They also know that the Soviet Union will increase its population by 10 million every year, while the United States will increase by less than 3 million. In 1960, the Soviet Union will have a population of more than 350 million, while the United States will have less than 150 million.
    This is a great competition, but even today, we can foresee its victory. Because "if the Bolsheviks guarantee when and what to have, these things should be regarded as already existing invisibly." (Barbusse)
    "Capitalism has produced productive forces that a slave society could not understand at all, but capitalism can and will be defeated, because socialism will produce greater productive forces." (Lenin)

    苏联建设三十年
    李慎之
    一九一七年十一月七日，在世界六分之一的土地上，第一次出现了叫做苏联的社会主义国家。中山先生称之为给“人类产生了一个大希望。”
    三十年的历史，证明苏联无愧于这样的赞誉。它已经把人类从最残酷的毁灭性的战争中解放出来，把文明从退回到野蛮的威胁中挽救出来，成为人类和平幸福最可靠而强固的支柱。
    从一个在三十年前被认为“难以相信的、落后的国家”（列宁），而能获致今日的地位，决不是偶然的，这只有这样一个国家：不但在政治组织上，而且在经济结构上都大大改变，并增强其生产力五倍至十倍时才有可能。苏联在三十年内完成的，就正是这一伟大工作，其三十年的历史，乃是艰苦奋斗与光辉成就交织的建设史。
    一九四二年二月，斯大林在其竞选演说中曾把一九一三年（即第一次世界大战前一年）的沙俄主要工农业生产量与一九四○（即德国侵苏前一年）苏联的产量相比，指出：一九一三年时，俄国出产铣铁四百二十二万吨，钢四百二十三万吨，煤二千九百万吨，石油九百万吨，粮食二千一百六十万吨，棉花七十四万吨。而一九四○年时，苏联生产铣铁一千五百万吨，比一九一三年多三倍；钢一千八百三十万吨，比一九一三年多三倍半；煤一亿六千六百万吨，比一九一三年多四倍半；石油三千一百万吨比一九一三年多两倍半，粮食三千八百万吨，比一九一三年多一千七百万吨；棉花二百万吨，比一九一三年多两倍半。这些数字雄辩的说明了：苏联为抗击并战胜德国所曾作的巨大努力。
    以工业的总生产量来说，苏联在一九四○年较沙俄在一九一三年时，增加了十二倍，这是惊人的数字；但苏联真正开始建设的时候，并不自一九一三年的工业水准开始，而在第一次世界大战与内战之后，在白军与外国干涉军大大毁损了俄国工业基础的时候，这就更足骇人听闻。当时苏联的工业只相当于一九一三年的七分之一，实际上已经退回到彼得大帝的时代，比美、英、德、法诸工业先进国家要落后到二百五十年。因此就工业发展的真正速度，苏联在一九四○年前二十年不到的时间中，增加了工业生产量八十四倍。成为世界上生产速度最快的第一位国家，这是人类史上未之前闻的数字。
    反观同一时期（一九一三——一九四○）资本主义各国中工业发展最速的美国，生产量增加还不及一倍。如以一九二九年在苏联第一次五年计划开始时，各主要工业国生产指数定为一百，则到一九三八年苏联第二次五年计划完成时，美国为七十，英国为一百一十二，德国为一百二十五，法国为七十，而苏联则为四百七十七。一九四○年时，德英法已卷入大战，美国略增至一百一十一，而苏联却又增高到五百三十四。这一年苏联工业生产量，已超过德英法诸国而居欧洲第一位，世界第二位。
    早在一九三一年时，斯大林曾指出：“我们比先进国家落后五十到一百年，我们应该在十年中走完这段路程，如果不能做到这一点，我们就要被消灭。”正好十年之后，最可怖的战争落到了苏联的头上，但它并没有被消灭，消灭的却是它的敌人，它已经在十年中走完了一百年的路程，“在一年中走完了二百五十年的路程，而且赶过头去了。”（美作家威廉·曼台尔语）
    苏联在农业上也有很大的成就。一九四○年苏联全部农地几已完全集体化，有集体农场二十四万多个，国营农场四千多个，拖拉机站七千多个，拖拉机五十三万架，运输卡车十八万二千辆，农村统用电力达二十七万五千千瓦，这些东西在一九一三年时几乎完全不存在。播种面积则自一九一三年时的一亿零五百万公顷增至一亿二千四百万公顷，谷物生产量增加达一点六倍，出口量增加达二倍，工业作物如棉花、亚麻、糖萝萄、向日葵的产量至少增加两倍至四倍。与工业生产一样这些数字说明着超纪录的速度。
    这样，苏联变成了一个农业的，同时也是工业的强国，在全世界只有美国具有同样的经济地位。苏联工农业所以发展得如此迅速，其主要原因，如斯大林所指出的：“这种史无前例的发展，不能认为是国家从落后走向进步的通常发展，这是由落后国家变成进步国家的跃进。”斯大林又指出：这种跃进，只是因为在布尔塞维克首先发展重工业与农业集体化的两大政策保证之下，才有可能。而这种政策之所以有可能，又只是因为苏联是一个社会主义的国家。在这样的一个国家中，一切银行重工业都收归国有了，使一个贫弱落后的国家，有可能一下筹集为发展重工业所必须的巨额资金，而无须走资本主义国家从轻工业利润中积累军工业资金的百年长途。又只有在这样的一个国家中，工农无产阶级真正掌握了政权，使一个生产散漫落后的小农国家，能够获得近代化的大量耕作的农业机器与设备，完成集体化而成为新型的具有高度生产力的大农业，避免了资本主义国家为达到大农业生产而先沦千万农民于破产的必由惨境。
    这样，苏联在第一次五年计划中就在基本上完成了的建立重工业与农业集体化，证明了是社会主义的大胜利。由于有了重工业，苏联得到了工业自立的基础，由于农业的集体化，使苏联飞速发展中的工业，获得了近代大农场始能供应的原料、粮食、以及因提高劳动生产力，而分出的必要人员。
    苏德战争考验了苏联建设的伟力，证明了“苏维埃制度比非苏维埃制度是最好的一种社会制度。”（斯大林）
    据苏联政府统计，希特勒匪徒给予苏联的损害如下：焚毁了一千七百个城镇，包括苏联最大的工业中心如斯大林格勒、列宁格勒、悉瓦斯托波尔、卡尔科夫、基辅……等在内，有七万个村庄，原有四百万人工作的三万二千个工厂与九万八千个集体农场，损失总值达六千七百亿卢布，七百万人牺牲生命（约等于澳洲总人口），二千五百万人无家可归：“德国人退出的地方象沙漠一样。”据希特勒匪徒在破坏完成后的估计，如要重建至恢复原状，至少须二十五年，“决没有另外一种社会的和国家制度能受得住这种军事的和经济的考验（伏兹涅森斯基：五年计划报告）。”
    但是就在这样的情况下：“苏联后方的工业不仅继续工作，而且补充了新的工厂企业”（莫洛托夫）。四年战争期中，乌拉尔区的工业生产增加了三点六倍，西伯利亚区增加了二点八倍，伏尔加区增加了三点四倍，这些在苏联东部新建的工业，煤不仅在战时给前线生产了足量的飞机大炮，而且大大扩展了苏联的工业基础，使之广泛的分布遍及苏联辽阔的疆土上，为进一步的发展提供了更有利的条件。
    战时苏联工业继续扩展，为战后工业复员与重建打下了良好的基础。一九四六年，即战争结束后仅仅一年，苏联即已在基本上完成了复员，民用物品的生产量较一九四五年时增加百分之二十，其价值增加达一百八十四亿卢布。同时，资本主义国家则开始了生产萎缩而陷入于普遍的萧条与危机。一九四六年美国工业生产量竟较战时缩减三分之一，失业者据官方宣布尚达三百万人。而苏联“却不知失业为何物，由于大批军人回到生产部门中去，苏联没有关闭一所工厂，在苏联由战争转变到和平，生产不仅未缩小，而且大为扩展”（日丹诺夫）。就在这一年离战争结束还不到五个月，苏联就又开始新的第四次五年计划了。
    正在实行中的五年计划，其目的要求在前三年内完全恢复战前生产水平，而在后两年内使工业生产水平较战前提高百分之四十八，农业百分之二十七；这就是说到一九五○年时，苏联将产铣铁一千九百五十万吨，钢二千五百四十万吨，煤二亿五千万吨。石油三千五百四十万吨，粮食一亿二千七百万吨。并且要把制造一切机器的母机，车床增加到一百三十万架，比美国一九四○年时还要超过百分之三十。这计划在其实行的第一年，已经百分之百的完成了，今年虽还不可能有最后数字，但就目前的统计言，不但完成而且已超过计划百分之三，比去年同时增加生产百分之十八，而且全苏联工人响应列宁格勒工人的号召，在十月革命三十周年念纪日以前完成全年计划，已有绝大部分完成。因此，第四次计划之必能在一九五○年甚或提前完成，已是勿庸置疑的事情。
    但是，苏联并不就以此为满足，早在战争结束才六个月之时，斯大林就定出了要在十五年后，使苏联生产超过战前三倍至四倍的目标；即生产：铣铁五千万吨、钢六千万吨，煤五亿吨，石油六千万吨。斯大林指出：“只有在这种条件下，才可以认为我们的祖国有了免于意外袭击的保证。”这就是说，到一九六○年时，苏联的工业生产量就要赶上现在占世界工业生产半数以上的美国，而居世界第一位。
    这是对人类命运具有决定意义的大事，苏联的工业超过美国，这就意味着世界和平与民主的力量，已经占有不可侵犯的绝对优势，这就意味着人类真正最后从战争威胁中永久解放出来，这就意味着一个和平安定繁荣富足的新时代的开始。
    这一令人难于相信的宏大计划，就连最反动的苏联敌人，鉴于过去三十年来猜测的失败，也不敢表示怀疑，这就是为什么战争贩子如布立特之辈，要惊呼：“时间在苏联方面！”因为他们知道，苏联是地球上资源最富的国家，且开采还不到十分之一，而美国则再过十年就要枯竭；他们也知道，苏联每年要增加人口一千万，而美国则还不到三百万。一九六○年时，苏联将有人口三亿五千万以上，而美国尚不足一亿五千万。
    这是一个伟大的竞赛，但是即使在今天。我们也已能预卜其胜利。因为“布尔塞维克如果保证什么时候，要有什么东西，这些东西就应该算作已经在无形中存在了。”（巴比塞）
    “资本主义产生了农奴社会完全不能理解的生产力，但资本主义能够而且必将被战败，因为社会主义将产生更伟大的生产力。”（列宁）
