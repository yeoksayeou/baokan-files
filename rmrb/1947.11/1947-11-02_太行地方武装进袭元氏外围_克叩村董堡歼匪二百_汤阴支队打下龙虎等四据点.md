[By Telegraph from this Newspaper, Taihang, 31st] Taihang local armed forces and militia have recently launched proactive attacks against the Chiang bandits in Shijiazhuang and Yuanshi, capturing the strongholds of Kou Village and Dong Fort, and eliminating over 200 enemies. On October 12th, a portion of our main force, in coordination with a certain unit of Central Hebei, captured the strongholds of Kou Village and Dong Fort, located more than 10 li east of Yuanshi City, and repelled a part of the Fifth Column of the puppet Hebei Security Force, which was reinforcing Yuanshi. We killed or wounded over 200 enemies and seized two machine guns and over 30 rifles. On the 20th, a portion of our main force ambushed near Shijiazhuang, killing or wounding over 20 members of the "Homecoming Legion," capturing three enemies, and routing a reinforcing Chiang bandit company, capturing 11 people and guns each, and wounding five enemies. Due to our successive victorious attacks, especially the complete annihilation of the Chiang bandit Third Army's reinforcements from the north, the Chiang bandits in Shijiazhuang and Yuanshi have become even more terrified and uneasy. The Chiang bandits in Shijiazhuang convened a meeting of cadres above platoon level, exclaiming "Hold Shijiazhuang," and rampantly conscripted soldiers and seized grain, attempting to resist stubbornly. The Zhao County and Gaoyi Security Forces stationed in Yuanshi have also been transferred to Shijiazhuang. Wei Yonghe and other remnants in isolated and helpless Yuanshi, on the 24th, used two battalions of troops to escort over a hundred large carts carrying the families and supplies of their troops to Shijiazhuang.

[By Telegraph from this Newspaper, Taihang, 31st] In the struggle against encroachment, the Tangyin Independent Detachment captured four strongholds, including Nanbeilizi, Xiaohetun, and Longhu, eliminating over 40 enemies, including the bandit battalion commander Li Duoshan. At dawn on the 18th of this month, our Independent Detachment, combined with the militia, launched a surprise attack in three routes on Lizi, Miaogang, Xiaohetun, and the south of Longhu Village. The enemy battalion commander Li Duoshan led his bandit troops to launch a charge against our militia and launched a fierce attack on the left side of our Lizi Gang Independent Detachment. The first grenade we threw exploded on the head of the great traitor Li Duoshan. Li Duoshan fell to the ground in response, and our army immediately launched a fierce counter-charge. The enemy could not hold out and abandoned the bodies and fled. We took advantage of the victory to pursue to the edge of Shuimowan Village, and the four strongholds of Nanbeilizi, Xiaohetun, and Longhu were immediately recovered by us. A total of 14 enemies, including the bandit battalion commander Li Duoshan, were killed or wounded, seven enemies were captured, and 20 members of the Hui Men were captured. We suffered no casualties.

[By Telegraph from this Newspaper, Taihang, 29th] The Chiang bandits in the isolated city of Anyang are facing extreme supply difficulties under the siege of our army and people. The soldiers' war-weariness is increasing, and they are forcibly conscripting grain and soldiers from residents in nearby villages. According to Liu Jinyu, a soldier of the First Battalion and First Company of the Security Regiment who defected to us with his gun on the 23rd of this month: most of the soldiers are scantily clad and unable to fill their stomachs. They have not been issued cotton clothing or pay since last year. The supply standard is two catties of rice (including oil and salt), but after deductions by the officers, it is only 20 liang. The soldiers are unwilling to endure this suffering and are fleeing in large numbers. In order to prolong its last gasp, the Chiang bandits are forcibly conscripting soldiers and seizing grain from villages near the city.
