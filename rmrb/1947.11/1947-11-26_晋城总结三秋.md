[This article comes from Taiyue on the 24th] Jincheng convened a county-wide meeting of labor heroes and cadres on the 29th of last month to summarize the autumn harvest, autumn planting, and autumn plowing. The county has completed the harvesting of 467,600 mu of early autumn crops and 337,337 mu of late autumn crops, and has also planted 420,000 mu of counter-offensive wheat, and plowed more than 220,000 mu of autumn land. There are still 240,000 mu of autumn land to be plowed. The following experiences were gained in summarizing the three autumn campaigns: (1) Good production can be achieved when hired peasants are in charge. The county's experience in production mutual aid over the past year has proven that mutual aid groups led by hired peasants are consolidated and developing upwards, otherwise problems arise and there is no way to solve them. For example, the third mutual aid group in Nankan City, led by the hired peasant Li San'gu, not only organized the entire village's labor force during the autumn harvest and planting, but also absorbed three blind people who had been unattended for many years into the group, solving all the difficulties in the entire harvest and planting process. The eighth group, led by middle peasants, first worked for themselves when planting wheat, and then for the families of military cadres and martyrs and participating civilian laborers. The mutual aid group in Yuneng Village further proved this point. With 16 hired peasants as the backbone to take the lead, it became the village with the best results in the county's three autumn campaigns, and began to move towards large-scale mutual aid of land, livestock, farm tools, and manure. (2) Mobilizing all military cadres, families of martyrs, and honorably discharged soldiers to help each other and contribute to the effort has greatly expanded the labor force. 30,317 military cadres, families of martyrs, and honorably discharged soldiers in the county declined preferential treatment from the masses and actively engaged in production to strive for model status, greatly alleviating the labor shortage. (3) Organizing people to pull plows is the best way to overcome the shortage of livestock. The fifth district created 1,800 strong plows, and Nanqincheng organized 20 people to pull plows, all of which were effective ways to accelerate plowing. (4) Organizing women and semi-laborers as the main force of production. This time, most of the harvesting of grain, beans, and stubble in the county was done by women. Women in the seventh district carried 338,131 loads of manure when planting wheat, and women in other villages also took the lead in plowing. (5) In addition to voluntary combination and equivalent exchange, democratic discussion to solve difficulties is the main key to mutual aid experience. For example, the Yuneng mutual aid group decided on wages through discussion based on the price of grain. When it was dry in the summer, everyone felt that a wage of five sheng of rice was too high, and they discussed changing it to three sheng; when the price of grain fell in the autumn, they discussed changing it back to five sheng. Therefore, the mutual aid group has always been consolidated and labor efficiency has also been improved. On the contrary, the mutual aid group in Langzhuang Village was not democratic, and because the cadres often held meetings and delayed work, everyone was unwilling to help them, and this problem was not solved in time, resulting in the collapse of the mutual aid group.

　　晋城总结三秋
    【本报太岳二十四日电】晋城于上月二十九日召开全县劳动英雄与干部会议，总结秋收秋种秋垡。全县已将四十六万七千六百亩早秋与三十三万七千三百三十七亩晚秋全部收场打净，又种了四十二万亩反攻麦，并垡过二十二万余亩秋地，现仍有二十四万亩秋地还赶垡中。在总结三秋运动中得出这几点经验：（一），雇贫当家生产就能搞好。一年来全县生产互助的经验证明，凡是雇贫农领导的互助组，皆是巩固向上发展，否则问题百出，越搞越没办法。如南堪城互助第三组，是雇贫李三古领导的，在秋收秋种中，他不但把全村人力组织起来，还将多年无人照管的三个瞎子也吸收到组内，解决了全部收种中的困难。而第八组是中农领导，在种麦时，先给自己做，然后才给军干烈属及参战民工做。庾能村互助组更证明了这点，以十六个雇贫作骨干起带头作用，成为全县三秋运动成绩最好的村子，并开始走向土地、牲畜、农具、粪土大互助。（二）动员起全县军干烈属及荣退军人互助立功，大大扩大了劳动面。全县有三万零三百十七户军干烈属及荣军谢绝群众优待，积极生产争取模范，大大减轻了劳力困难。（三）组织人拉犁是克服牲畜困难的最好办法。五区创造一千八百张强犁，南勤城组织人拉犁二十张，皆是加速垡地的有效办法。（四），组织妇女全半劳力作为生产主力军。此次全县的割谷、割豆、刨茬大部是妇女干的，七区妇女在种麦时即担粪三十三万八千一百三十一担，其他村庄妇女还有带头掌犁的。（五）互助经验除自愿结合等价交换外，民主讨论解决困难则是主要的关键。如庾能互助组定工资皆由大家按粮价高低讨论规定，夏天天旱时，大家觉得五升米工资太高，讨论改为三升；到秋天粮价低落了，又讨论改为五升，因此互助组一直是巩固的，劳动效率也提高了。相反的，朗庄村互助组不民主，又因干部常开会误工，大家都不愿意和他们互助，也未及时解决这个问题，结果互助组就垮了。
