　　Dongming Independent Regiment and Guerrilla Force
  　Make a Long-Distance Incursion Back into the Base Area
    Sweeping Away Chiang's Bandits and Capturing Sixty Enemies
    [Our newspaper's dispatch from Jiluyu, 7th] On October 2nd, the Dongming Independent Regiment and the Guerrilla Force, after a seventy-plus li long-distance raid, inserted themselves back into the base area, sweeping away local bullies and Chiang bandits. In two days, they captured Chiang bandits such as Zhai Jinsheng, etc., totaling sixty-one people, and obtained over a thousand catties of rice. In the battle of Xutang, they obtained eighteen rifles, one horse-drawn cart, and fifteen livestock. Our local armed forces distributed a large quantity of grain and clothing from the captured spoils to relieve the masses.
    [Our newspaper's dispatch from Jiluyu, 9th] The stubborn bandits in Qihe frequently robbed grain, pulled livestock, and kidnapped people in the border areas of Qi and Yu, causing the local people to be afraid to stay at home, resulting in a shortage of manpower and animal power, and autumn harvesting and wheat planting could not be carried out on time. In addition to using a portion of their troops for cover, a certain regiment of our Sixth Military Subdistrict concentrated all personnel and horses, starting from the 6th of last month, to help the masses with emergency harvesting and planting, while simultaneously launching a political offensive. In the first week, they helped the masses in four villages, including Huadian in the Fourth District, to harvest 986 mu of soybeans, transport 85.5 mu of soybeans, and plant 508 mu of wheat, and also did work such as harvesting corn, threshing corn, threshing fields, and carrying bags. In addition, they wrote 251 slogans and launched extensive publicity activities. The masses responded very well. For example, the cadre of Yuanzhuang Village said: "If it weren't for our army to help, who would dare to come home? We wouldn't even be able to plant one-third of the wheat this year! With you here, we can at least plant half of the land!" An old lady said: "If it weren't for you, all our crops would have rotted in the ground! Before you came, the village was like a wasteland, and you couldn't even see anyone on the streets!" Ding Chuanfeng of Huadian said: "When the 'rotten mud' (miscellaneous stubborn bandits) from the city came, we ran east and west. When you came, everyone could live peacefully this autumn, and you even helped us with our work! The Eighth Route Army is truly the people's army!"
    Another dispatch: The Third Company of the Special Service Battalion of the Jiluyu Military Region helped the masses plant 397.5 mu of wheat (sown and leveled). This is equivalent to more than two-thirds of the wheat planted in the village (the whole village planted 512 mu of wheat). The masses said: "This year, we planted more than 100 mu than before." In helping with autumn harvesting and wheat planting, many model squads, platoons, and individuals emerged. They took the lead in working, did not complain of fatigue, did not rest, and constantly encouraged all comrades in the company to go to the fields early and return home late, and to fetch water, sweep the floor, and do chores after returning home. In addition to providing water for ten households, the entire machine gun 7th squad also carried out small drills, studied, cleaned guns, and tidied up their internal affairs every day.

　　东明独立团·武工队
  　长途奔袭插回本区
    横扫蒋匪捉敌六十
    【本报冀鲁豫七日电】东明独立团、武工队，于十月二日经七十余里之长途奔袭，插回本区，横扫土顽蒋匪，两天中活捉蒋匪翟金生等六十一名，得大米千余斤，并于许堂战斗中，得大枪十八枝、马车一辆，牲口十五匹，我地方武装将所缴获胜利品中大批粮食、衣物，分发救济群众。
    【本报冀鲁豫九日电】齐河顽匪经常到我齐禹边沿区抢粮、拉牲口、抓人，当地群众不敢在家，以致人力畜力缺乏，秋收种麦不能按时进行，我六分区某团除用一部分兵力掩护外，另一部则集中全体人员马匹，自上月六日开始帮助群众抢收抢种，同时进行政治攻势。计第一周共帮助四区化店等四个村群众，割豆子等九百八十六亩，运豆子等八十五亩半，种麦五百零八亩，还做了收棒子、打棒子、打场、扛布袋等活。此外又写了二百五十一条标语，并展开广泛的宣传活动，群众反映很好，如袁庄村干说：“要不是咱军队来给干，老百姓谁敢家来？今年连三分之一的麦子也种不上！你们这一来，最少也得一半地种上麦子！”一个老太太说：“要不是你们来，我们这些庄稼都得烂在地里！你们没来时，村里好象荒场样，大街上连个人也看不见！”化店的丁传风说：“城里的‘烂泥’（杂牌顽匪）来了，我们东跑西窜，你们来了，大伙才安生的过这个秋，你们还帮着做活！八路军真是老百姓的队伍！”
    又电：冀鲁豫军区特务营三连，共帮助群众种麦三百九十七亩半（耩上，并且砸了）。相当于驻村种麦的三分之二强（全村种五百一十二亩麦子），群众说：“今年比以前多种了一百多亩。”在帮助秋收种麦中，出现了很多模范班、排和个人，他们干活带头，不说累，不休息，不断鼓动全连同志早下地晚回家，回家后打水扫地干杂活。机枪七班全班每天除供给十家群众吃水，还出小操、学习、擦枪、整理内务。
