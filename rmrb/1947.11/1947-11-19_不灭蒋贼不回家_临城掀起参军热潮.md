Led by him, village chief Wang Chenggun, Farmers' Association Chairman Wang Yukao, and two others signed up to join the army. Yang Xinshun, the head of the Dongshang Farmers' Association, said: "I've been oppressed my whole life. I want to seek revenge. I will never return home until Chiang Kai-shek is eliminated." He led the deputy village chief, the deputy militia director, and four others to enlist.

Zhang Erni, a liberated poor peasant from Xishuangjing, signed up her son, Chuncheng, saying, "My eldest son has been in the army for several years. My second son, Chuncheng, is old enough too. I'm also sending him to fight Old Chiang." In the eastern base area of the first district, fifteen villages, at the celebration of the nationwide counter-offensive victory, Comrade Ma Junqi of the County Party Committee said: "If you want to turn over, if you want to live a good life, the only way is to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek. Today, I will personally join the counter-offensive army. Good Party members and good cadres, follow me. Let's go together." At his call, ninety-six people signed up on the spot.

    At a mass meeting of forty-four villages held in Chengguan on the 7th of this month, Comrade Lu Jindong, representative of the County Committee, issued a loud call to all Party members and cadres in the county to lead the masses and stand on the front lines of the counter-offensive!

Haozhuang Militia Director said, "Fighting feudalism is like digging up weeds; if you don't dig them up completely, they will grow back in the dug-up ground, so you must defeat them completely." The entire county is continuing this movement. (Feng Ze, Zhen Wei, Zhen Wen)
