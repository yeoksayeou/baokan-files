　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: Moscow dispatch: Following the call from Leningrad workers to "complete the Five-Year Plan in four years," workers in various industries across the Soviet Union have been actively responding. To date, hundreds of factories, after meticulously assessing their own capabilities and various possibilities, have solemnly proposed guarantees to complete the Five-Year Plan within four years. Newspapers are publishing increasing numbers of factories and workers answering the challenge, including advanced factories in Moscow, the Urals, and Ukraine that have already completed and exceeded their full-year plans for this year, such as the "Kalibo" factory in Moscow, where the average output per worker has exceeded pre-war levels by 50 percent, the Moscow Machine Factory, where output in the first month of this year increased by 17 percent compared to the entire last year, and the "Sickle and Hammer" iron foundry, among others. Ukrainian Donets coal miner Alynnikov expressed the miners' high enthusiasm, saying: "Miners wholeheartedly support the patriotic challenge of the Leningrad workers. The sooner the Five-Year Plan is completed, the sooner the wounds inflicted on our country by the war will be healed. To answer the challenge of the Leningrad workers, I guarantee that I will complete five years of production tasks in three years." Many collectives and individuals are also making similar guarantees to the bank. The conference of Ukrainian steel enterprises discussing the Leningrad workers' challenge letter was packed, an unprecedented scene.
