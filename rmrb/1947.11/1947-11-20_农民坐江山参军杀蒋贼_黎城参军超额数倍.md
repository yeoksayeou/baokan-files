　　Peasants Take Power, Join the Army to Kill Chiang Kai-shek
  　Licheng Exceeds Conscription Quota Several Times Over
    [This Dispatch from Licheng] Based on the continued deepening of the land reform movement and the gradual increase in mass awareness, and powerfully encouraged by the victory of the counter-offensive, this county launched a widespread mass conscription movement after the autumn harvest. Throughout the county's districts and villages, "Celebration of the Counter-Offensive Victory Conferences" were held to conduct intensive current affairs mobilization among party members, cadres, heroic activists, and the entire peasant masses, enhancing their confidence in victory. Simultaneously, through various small-scale discussions and individual mobilization efforts, emancipated peasants were organized to recall their history of liberation, focusing on accounting for grievances and tracing roots. Peasants came to realize that all war disasters were caused by Chiang Kai-shek. If Chiang Kai-shek is not eliminated, there will be no peace. This greatly inspired the masses' enthusiasm for joining the army. They voluntarily proposed: "Land reform is not enough; we must take up arms to defend our gains," "Uproot the small roots to uproot the old roots," "If you want to eat your fill, you must do it yourself," "Peasants take power, join the army to kill Chiang Kai-shek," "One person joins the army, the whole family is honored." Thus, countless exemplary stories of parents sending their sons, wives sending their husbands, and brothers persuading each other emerged, launching a mass conscription movement led by party members and cadres, with poor and lower-middle peasants as the backbone.
    Shen Lian of Jialing was from Lin County. He had suffered greatly from the exploitation of landlords and usurious loans. Driven by debt, he came to Licheng seeking food. Now that he has been emancipated, he recalls his own bitter history and recognizes that all landlords under heaven are of the same root. Chiang Kai-shek, the old root, must be uprooted to achieve thorough emancipation. She said: "My man is old, so I'm letting my son, Ma Shuanhai, join the army to uproot Chiang's root and help all the poor people of the world to be emancipated." Stories of relatives sending relatives spread throughout the county, with dozens of such cases, creating a widespread public opinion that "joining the army is honorable." The number of registrations in each district reached two to ten times the original plan. Colleges, factories, and businesses also joined the movement, with a large number of registrations and an unprecedentedly high level of political quality.
    In order to ensure the good quality of the new recruits, the mass mobilization viewpoint was adhered to and examinations were conducted by the poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasant groups in Dongyangguan carried out mass reviews of new recruits. First, they discussed and recognized that joining the army was to defend class interests and go south to eliminate Chiang's bandits. Therefore, they proposed that it must be voluntary and stipulated several conditions: (1) It must be peasants, not landlords or rich peasants; (2) It must be politically firm, not secret agents; (3) It must be healthy, without infectious diseases; (4) It must be upright, not hooligans, ruffians, or corrupt elements. As a result, eleven out of the fourteen applicants in the whole village passed the review. At the same time, in order to ensure that the new recruits could fight with peace of mind, the masses were mobilized to specifically help them resolve their family concerns. According to reports from various villages, the specific family concerns of the new recruits mainly include: (1) the level of family production and living; and (2) the fear that their wives would be "tampered with." These two problems were resolved through the strength of the masses. The masses and the military families made specific guarantees, so that the new recruits could quickly dispel their concerns and settle down. Li Yiting of Dongyangguan proposed: In the future, we will better organize military family production to ensure a rising standard of living. Wu Xinkuan proposed that we will strictly check the "tampering with" of wives in the future, and everyone agreed that whoever "tampers with" a wife will be handed over to the masses for disposal. Zhao Fengying, a military family member, said: "My man has joined the army, and I will work hard at home. I won't ask for special treatment for what I can do, and I guarantee I won't be a hooligan or become corrupt." Jia Sike, a representative of the new recruits, said: "Everyone supports us, which is very glorious. We won't come back until Chiang Kai-shek is eliminated!"

　　农民坐江山参军杀蒋贼
  　黎城参军超额数倍
    【本报黎城讯】本县在土改运动继续深入、群众觉悟逐步提高的基础上，与反攻胜利的有力鼓舞下，于收耕结束后开展了一个广大群众性的热烈参军运动。全县各区村通过“庆祝反攻胜利大会”，对党员干部英雄积极分子全体农民群众，集中进行了时事大动员，提高了胜利信心，同时结合各种小型座谈与个别发动，组织翻身农民回忆翻身历史，抓紧算负担追根，农民认识到：一切战争灾害都是蒋介石给的，蒋介石一天不消灭，兵慌马乱（群众意即战争灾害）一天不得安生。由此大大启发了群众的参军热情。自动提出：“土地翻身不算话，还得拿枪当了家”，“刨倒小根刨老根，”“要想吃饱饭，亲自下手干”，“农民坐江山参军杀蒋贼”，“一人参军全家光荣”，因此出现了无数的父母送儿子、妻子送丈夫、兄弟相劝的模范事迹，展开了一个以党员干部带头、贫雇为骨干、群众性的参军运动。
    贾岭申连是林县人，曾受尽地主高利贷剥削，因债务所逼要饭来黎城，现在翻了身，他回忆起自己辛酸历史来，认识到天下地主一条根，必须刨到老根蒋介石，才能彻底翻身。她说：“我男人年老了，我让我马拴孩儿参军去刨蒋根，帮助天下穷人都翻身。”亲人送亲人故事，传闻全县，不只数十件，普遍造成了“参军光荣”的群众舆论。各区报名达原计划两倍至十倍，各高校、工厂、商号亦卷入运动中，大量报名，政治质量空前提高。
    为了保证新军质量好，坚持贯澈了发动观点，通过贫雇农来审查。东阳关贫雇小组进行群众性新军审查工作，首先讨论认识参军是为了保卫阶级利益，南下消灭蒋贼，因此提出必须自愿，并规定了几个条件：（一）要农民不要地主富农，（二）政治坚定不要特务分子，（三）要身体健康不要有传染病者，（四）要正派不要流氓兵痞腐化分子。结果全村十四个报名的，审查合格十一个。同时为了保证新军出外安心作战，同样通过发动群众，具体帮助其解决家庭顾虑。据各村反映，新军具体家庭顾虑主要有两个：一是家庭生产、生活水平问题，一是恐怕老婆被人“拆跟脚”。这两个问题经过群众力量来解决，由群众和军属提出具体保证，使新军思想上很快会解除顾虑安心下来。东阳关李义廷提出：今后很好组织军属生产，保证生活上升。吴心宽提出，今后严格检查“拆跟脚”，大家一致同意，谁要再“拆跟脚”交由群众处理。军属赵凤英提出：“我男人参军啦，我在家好好生产，能作了的事，总不叫人优待，保证不流氓腐化。”新军代表贾思科提出：“大家拥护我们，这很光荣，啥时消灭不了蒋介石啥时不回来！”
