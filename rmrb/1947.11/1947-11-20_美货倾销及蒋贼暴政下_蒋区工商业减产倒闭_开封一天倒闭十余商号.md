Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. Comprehensive reports indicate that under the pressure of American goods dumping and Chiang Kai-shek's brutal rule, industries and businesses in the Chiang-controlled areas are collapsing and reducing production one after another. The Tenth District of the match industry nationwide (in the Chiang-controlled area), including fifteen factories such as Tianjin Danhua, Beiyang, etc. (ten factories), Beijing Housheng, etc. (three factories), and one factory each in Baoding and Botou, has seen its total monthly output shrink to 300 boxes due to competition from American and Japanese matches, regressing to the production level of 1926. In Kaifeng alone, 45 shops closed down in October. On October 25th, more than ten businesses, including Qiadechang and Kuiyuan, closed their doors in a single day. In the entire northern Henan cotton-producing area, only the Huaxin Yarn Factory in Jixian and a small yarn factory in Xinxiang are barely surviving. The Huaxin factory currently produces only 17 pieces of 20-count yarn and 45 bolts of Victory cloth per day. An editorial titled "Market Conditions" in the Kaifeng Industrial and Commercial Bulletin on the 21st of last month stated: "For a long time, it has evolved into a situation where hoarding raw materials is more profitable than producing goods in factories. Moreover, with the dumping of foreign goods (referring to American goods), who would be willing to do loss-making business in domestic industry and commerce?" The report also listed the Chiang bandit authorities' destruction of industry and commerce and their extortionate policies, pointing out that for the businesses in Kaifeng that have joined the Chamber of Commerce, in addition to bearing commodity taxes, business taxes, etc., there are also temporary levies for rifles, bullets, railway timber, bran, and other items. These levies alone amounted to more than 700 million yuan in October, according to verifiable records.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th. Comprehensive reports from Tianjin Dagong Bao continuously reveal that Tianjin's industrial crisis is severe, and the number of factories closing down is increasing daily. From January to August of this year, 132 factories closed down, while from May to December of last year, only 72 factories closed down. The hundred-plus closed factories include various industrial sectors such as weaving and dyeing, sock knitting, rubber, soap making, ironwork, and flour milling. Of the more than 200 alkali-using industries (oils, glass, leather making, etc.) in the city, less than half are open, with the rest on the verge of collapse. Of the 192 enemy and puppet factories sold by the Chiang bandit authorities in the past two years, only 29 with "special connections" have started operations. All factories in Tianjin that have not yet declared closure are also mostly reducing production, barely surviving. The main reason for the industrial crisis is that due to inflation and high prices, the income from selling manufactured goods is no longer sufficient to maintain simple reproduction. Moreover, the Chiang Kai-shek gang's intensified extortion of donations and taxes leaves the national industry with no room to breathe. Taking a small soap factory in Tianjin as an example: its investment capital is 3 million yuan, its capital turnover is 20 million yuan, and its quarterly turnover is 40 million yuan; however, the profit tax, business tax, stamp tax, and other various apportioned donations and taxes it bears amount to a staggering 6.88 million yuan. Dagong Bao admitted that the "real value of the factory's capital is gradually disappearing in the inflation, and even its profit margin is almost completely eroded by heavy taxes and levies."

　　美货倾销及蒋贼暴政下
  　蒋区工商业减产倒闭
    开封一天倒闭十余商号
    【新华社陕北十八日电】综合各方报导：在美货倾销与蒋介石暴政压迫下，蒋区工商各业纷纷倒闭减产。全国（蒋区）火柴业第十区包括天津丹华、北洋等十厂、北平厚生等三厂、保定、泊头各一厂，共计十五厂，因不堪美、日火柴竞争，每月总产量已缩减为三百箱，已倒退至民国十五年之产量。开封仅十月份歇业商店即达四十五家。十月二十五日一天中就有袷德昌、魁元等十余家商号关门。整个豫北产棉区现仅有汲县的华新纱厂及新乡一家规模甚小之纱厂，尚在勉强支持。华新厂现仅日产二十支纱十七件，胜利布四十五匹。开封工商导报上月二十一日题为“商情”社论中称：“很久以来，已演成工厂的出品还不如囤积原料赚钱，加以外货（按指美货）倾销，谁又肯在本国工商业上做亏本生意呢？”该报并历举蒋匪当局对工商业之摧残与勒索苛政指出：以开封已入商会的商号说，他们除负担货物税、营业税等外，尚有长枪、子弹、铁道木料、麸料等等名目的临时摊派，此种摊派十月份仅有帐可查的数项即达七亿元以上。
    【新华社陕北十二日电】综合天津大公报连续披露消息：天津工业危机深重，歇业倒闭之工厂日多。自今年一月至八月歇业者达一百三十二家，而去年五月至十二月歇业工厂尚仅为七十二家。百余家歇业工厂中包括织染、织袜、橡胶、造胰、铁工、面粉等各工业部门。全市二百余家用碱工业（油脂、玻璃、制革等）开门者不到半数，其余都在奄奄待毙中。两年来蒋匪当局标售之敌伪工厂共达一百九十二家，但其中开工者仅为有“特殊凭藉”之二十九家。津市所有尚未宣告歇业之厂家，亦多实行减产，荀延残喘。工业危机之主要原因：由于通货膨胀，物价高昂，出卖制成品所得，已不足维持单纯再生产；且蒋家匪帮加紧勒索捐税，致使民族工业无喘息余地。今以津市一家小造胰厂为例：其中投资本额为三百万元，资金流转额二千万元，每季营业额四千万元；而它所负担之利得税、营业税、印花税及其他各项摊派捐税共计竟达六百八十八万元之巨。大公报承认：厂家“资本实值，固在通货膨胀中逐渐消失，即其盈利部分，也几乎被重税苛捐剥蚀净尽了。”
