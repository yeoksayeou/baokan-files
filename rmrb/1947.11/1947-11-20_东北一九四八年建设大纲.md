Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 18th: The following are the main points of the basic plan outline for economic construction in the Northeast Liberated Area in 1948:

	Regarding agricultural production: (1) Under the principle of combining expanding cultivated land area with intensive cultivation, the total grain output will be increased by one million tons, of which 150,000 tons will be in South Manchuria. The government will reward land reclamation (virgin land or abandoned land for more than three years) with exemption from military grain levies (fully exempt for the first year, one-third levied in the second year, and two-thirds levied in the third year). Various agricultural loans will be issued to help poor farmers and immigrants solve difficulties in production. In areas suitable for planting rice and wheat, water conservancy projects will be constructed to open up more paddy fields and increase wheat fields. The government will issue water conservancy loans of 150,000 million yuan. (2) Promote special crops such as cotton and flax, planting 75,000 hectares of cotton fields, producing 5,500 tons of ginned cotton. The government will issue cotton loans of 220,000 million yuan. The cultivated area of flax will be expanded to 13,500 hectares, producing 2,500 tons of refined and coarse yarn. Seed loans for cotton and flax will be issued for 130,000 million yuan. For sugar beets, Songjiang will expand planting to 10,000 hectares, supplying raw materials for 6,000 tons of sugar. For tobacco leaves, 5,000 hectares will be planted in the Fengcheng area of South Manchuria, producing 5 million catties of tobacco leaves. (3) Develop animal husbandry to increase animal power, fertilizer, and raw materials for grain, meat, and fur industries. All efforts will be made to increase animal power by 13,000 heads. Multiply young horses and cattle by one-tenth, sheep by one-quarter, and at least one pig should be raised per household in rural areas. In addition to government loans of 200,000 million yuan, it is advocated to protect draught animals, strictly prohibit slaughter and export, and organize livestock disease prevention and medical work. (4) Develop rural sideline production: It plays a significant role in revitalizing the rural economy and increasing people's wealth. Governments at all levels must adopt various forms of cooperative mutual aid organizations according to different situations and needs, and use the slack farming season to engage in salt boiling, alkali boiling, firewood gathering, charcoal burning, fodder grass collection, fishing, hunting, collection of mountain goods and medicinal materials, weaving straw hats, and raising chickens, rabbits, silkworms, and bees. Railway bureaus and trade agencies must help transport and sell various local products and mountain goods. (5) Develop public farms: For self-sufficiency production by rear institutions and troops, most of the past commercial capital must be invested in agricultural production. According to different situations, different production tasks of three mu, five mu, seven mu, and ten mu per person will be given to organize large farms or zonal small farms. Existing fire plows will be used, and agricultural machinery will be purchased for cultivation. Implement enterprise management, reasonable profit sharing, so that public farms play a demonstration role in collective labor and improved farming among farmers. (6) Organize production cooperation and improve labor productivity, so that more than 60% of the rural labor force is organized, more than 40% of young and middle-aged women are mobilized to participate in labor, 10% of the urban population is mobilized to engage in agricultural production, and a precise war-time work system is implemented to avoid missing the farming season and prevent waste. (7) Reward labor models and launch a production competition campaign. (8) Issue loans of 450,000 million yuan, including 250,000 million yuan for draught animals and immigration loans, 150,000 million yuan for water conservancy loans, and 50,000 million yuan for cotton and flax loans. The principle of agricultural loan allocation is to place a large amount in grain-rich and consolidated core areas, and use it with emphasis. Government loans can only play a supporting role, mainly relying on mobilizing and organizing the strength of the masses, and using the property and movables confiscated from feudal landlords to develop production and build homes. (9) Protect forests: Do not burn mountains or cut down trees arbitrarily. Protect the forestry industry, implement state-owned provincial management, and share profits at a ratio of 40% to 60%. Strengthen the storage and transportation of lumber.

	Regarding industrial production: (1) Mining and metallurgical industry: Coal, 3.5 million tons produced annually in North Manchuria, 500,000 tons in South Manchuria. The government implements multi-production and multi-transportation of coal, with low prices and wide sales. Steelmaking and iron smelting restore necessary iron ore and steelmaking. Strengthen existing gold mining work, implement state-owned management, and prohibit buying and selling. Salt must guarantee the needs of the Northeast Liberated Area. Other ores such as lead, copper, tungsten, manganese, mica, and sulfur must be planned and restored on a small scale according to special needs. (2) Machine industry: Organize the rational production of public machine factories in the railway, military, industrial and mining systems, shifting from restoring and repairing various machines to researching and manufacturing various small machines, and supporting private iron factories for planned production. (3) Electricity industry: Rectify existing power plants to ensure production and daily electricity needs, and strive for self-sufficiency in some electrical materials. (4) Develop the textile industry: Complete the establishment of four textile factories in North Manchuria, and organize public and private textile factories and workshops to ensure the completion of military clothing and civilian fabric needs. Focus on developing civilian handicraft textile industry. North Manchuria should maintain more than 150,000 skilled textile households regularly. Develop flax and wool textile industry, improve flax preparation and yarn spinning and weaving technology, prepare to establish two new flax factories, and strive to gradually achieve the goal of North Manchuria producing its own flax and wool fabrics to replace some cotton fabrics. (5) Clothing industry and leather industry: Taking existing public clothing factories and shoe factories as a base, organize private enterprises to ensure the needs of military clothing, military blankets, and military shoes. Strive for self-sufficiency in most dyes, and reward research and development of dye manufacturing. All horses, cattle, pigs, sheep, dogs, rabbits, etc. slaughtered in various cities must be skinned, and those who violate this will be subject to heavy taxes. Organize leather factories in various places for planned production, and strive for full supply of leather for military and civilian use.

	The operating policy of public enterprises must implement the basic principles of increasing production, improving quality, and reducing costs, implement cost accounting, strengthen enterprise management, improve labor efficiency, pay attention to worker education, streamline non-production personnel, and implement wartime wage policies. Support the development of private industry. All kinds of private industries related to war and people's livelihood will be supported by the government as long as they do not violate the laws and labor policies of the democratic government, and will be given legal protection. In addition to providing convenience for product transportation and sales, the government will also help solve difficulties in raw materials, fuel, and power as much as possible. Those lacking funds for operation will be provided with industrial loans by the Northeast Bank. For all public industrial and mining enterprises that the government currently has no space to operate, private capital is allowed to rent them for a long time or operate them as public-private joint ventures under the regulations of government laws. The government will ban or restrict special enterprises that violate prohibitions, engage in superstitious items, counterfeit inferior goods, and speculate and manipulate the people's livelihood. In order to support the development of necessary private industries, in addition to providing legal protection and rewards, the government will also issue loans of 100,000 million yuan, and another 200,000 million yuan in public loans.

	Regarding the development of inland commerce and cooperatives: The basic policy of inland commerce is to stabilize prices, support production, and ensure supply. Speculative commerce is strictly prohibited, and a trade policy combining internal freedom and external management, and combining public and private trade is implemented. Abolish transit taxes similar to likin checkpoints and any methods of blocking materials between provinces and counties, give legitimate merchants convenience in road passes, inspections, and transshipment, promulgate wartime industrial and commercial management laws, guarantee legitimate industrial and commercial businesses of national capital, ban and transform feudal commercial organizations such as tooth guilds, brokers, and trade associations, and establish new exchanges and traders. Stipulate reasonable handling fees, protect legitimate commercial profits, and ban profiteering by unscrupulous merchants.

	Develop cooperative undertakings, focusing on rural areas, and gradually make cooperative economy an important mass cell of the new democratic economy, responsible for eliminating excessive intermediate exploitation, regulating the appropriate interests of producers and consumers, supporting rural production, and enlivening rural finance. Make it a bridge combining urban and rural economy and public and private operations.
