　　[Comprehensive Xinhua News Agency dispatches of the 26th and 27th] Reports from various sources: The struggle of the Italian working people against Fascists and reactionaries is further deepening and expanding. In the north, the Genoa dockworkers' union recently announced: "To express solidarity with French workers, we will no longer unload ships from any French port to Genoa." Representatives of the worker-managed production committees, numbering 7,000 workers (including guerrillas wearing old mountain combat uniforms), held a conference in Milan on the 23rd, putting forward the demand for widespread worker control of industry and calling on all democratic forces to unite in a broad democratic front for peace and freedom, in order to "implement profound reforms of Italian social institutions." Longo, one of the leaders of the Italian Communist Party, warned Gasperi at the meeting: "The demand for worker-managed production committees must be implemented." "The tens of thousands of workers present showed remarkable unanimity in denouncing the government and right-wing labor leaders." According to a United Press dispatch, it is reported that the demand for implementing worker control of industry will be submitted to parliament for discussion.
　　According to a TASS dispatch of the 24th: The number of strikers throughout the South reached 2.5 million. The situation is particularly tense in the provinces of Grande, Matera, and Apulia. When the people of Bitudo, near Bari (the capital of Apulia province), held a demonstration on the 21st, Fascist thugs threw grenades at the procession. The residents of the city were enraged and broke through police suppression, attacking and destroying the local branches of the Christian Democratic Party and the monarchist Fascist organization, setting them on fire. The police were forced to hide indoors. Police reinforcements transferred from Bari by truck were pursued by organized detachments of striking workers, forced to retreat, and several policemen were injured. Another motorized unit of reinforcements was only able to enter the city late in the evening. In Gravina, Apulia, a Christian Democratic landlord fired on demonstrating peasants from his residence, killing one Communist cadre. The local people immediately took action against this provocative act and removed the landlord's property. This large-scale strike against Fascists and landlords, centered in Apulia province, lasted for a week and ended provisionally on the 23rd with a victory. Under mass pressure, the landlords of Apulia province and Basilicata accepted the demands and conditions put forward by the agricultural workers, such as wage increases, and signed agreements with representatives of the agricultural workers' unions in various places. Agricultural Minister Sigrini, intimidated by the power of the masses, has allowed the appropriation of 165 million lire, which the government has long denied, for public works in Apulia. Strikes in the provinces of Grande and Frus also ended with the victory of the working people. However, the working people are not disbanding their ranks because they do not trust the "goodwill" of the landlords. A general strike protesting against Fascists, landlords, and police is beginning to develop in many cities in the provinces of Cosenza and Cardinjalo in southern Italy.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th] According to a TASS dispatch: The vigorous growth of the French and Italian people's movement has further exposed the hideous features of American imperialism. According to a "Flash News" report published in the Paris Figaro newspaper: All U.S. naval forces in the Mediterranean (including the world's largest aircraft carrier "Midway," five light and heavy cruisers, and ten destroyers) intend to concentrate in the port of Naples before the 28th of this month. The report stated that the US fleet's intention to concentrate in Naples is directly related to events in the Mediterranean coast, especially in Italy and France."

　　意北反法西斯运动深入扩展
    工人要求管制工业
    南方罢工者曾达二百五十万
    【综合新华社二十六、二十七日电】各方讯：意大利劳动人民反对法西斯及反动分子的斗争进一步深入扩大。在北部，热那亚码头工人工会顷宣布：“为了表示与法国工人的团结，从法国任何港口到热那亚的船只，我们不再为其卸货。”工人管理生产委员会七千工人的代表（其中有穿着旧时山地作战军服的游击队员），二十三日在米兰召开大会，提出工人广泛管制工业的要求，号召一切民主力量团结在为和平及自由的广大民主阵线中，以“实行意大利社会机构的深刻的改革”。大会敦促工人委员会“在立宪议会及全国范围中对反动派展开最有效的行动。”意共领袖之一隆哥在会上警告加斯贝利说：“工人管理生产委员会的要求必须执行。”“与会的成千成万工人，在斥责政府及右翼劳工领袖中，表现了显著的一致性。”合众社电，据息：实行工人管制工业的要求，将送达议会讨论。
    据塔斯社二十四日电：整个南方罢工人数曾达二百五十万。在大兰多、马特拉尔、阿蒲里亚等省，情势特别紧张。巴利（阿蒲里亚省府）附近之比杜多人民，二十一日举行示威游行时，因法西斯恶棍向队伍抛掷手榴弹，该城居民怒不可遏，乃冲破警察之镇压，进攻并捣毁基督教民主党及保皇法西斯组织的地方支部，并予以焚毁。警察被迫躲入房内。自巴利乘卡车调来增援的警察，途中为有组织的罢工工人支队追击，被迫后退，并有数名警察受伤。另一增援的摩托化部队，只在入晚方能进入城内。在阿蒲里亚的格拉温，基督教民主党地主在他的住宅内向示威农民开火，击毙共产党干部一人。当地人民对这种挑衅行为立刻采取行动，并运走地主的财产。这以阿蒲里亚省为中心的反对法西斯及地主的大罢工，历时一周，已于二十三日取得胜利而暂告结束。阿蒲里亚省及巴希里卡塔的地主们，在群众压力下，接受了农业工人提出的增资等要求及条件，并在各处与农业工人工会代表签订了协议。农业部长西格尼慑于群众的威力，已允许将政府抵赖已久的一亿六千五百万里拉拨作阿蒲里亚公共工程之用。在大兰多、佛尔斯等省，亦以劳动人民之胜利而结束罢工。然而劳动人民并不解散自己的队伍，因为他们不相信地主们的“善良”。意南科森萨及卡丁嘉洛等省许多城市，抗议法西斯分子、地主与警察的总罢工，正在开始发展中。
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】据塔斯社讯：法意人民运动的蓬勃生长，使美帝国主义的狰狞面目更暴露无遗。据巴黎费嘉罗报刊载“快讯”新闻社讯：美驻地中海一切海军力量（包括世界最大航空母舰“中途”号，五艘轻重巡洋舰，十艘驱逐舰），意图在本月二十八日以前集中于那不勒斯港。该报导称，美国舰队之企图在那不勒斯集中，直接与在地中海沿岸特别是意法事件有关”。
