　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th. Vienna dispatch: The Austrian Communist Party (ACP) opposes the Austrian government's implementation of "currency reform" under American orders (note: this bill was passed by parliament on the 20th), and the Communist Minister of Power Industry, Altmann, has announced his withdrawal from the government because of this. The Secretariat of the Central Committee of the ACP has issued a letter to all party members, condemning the "currency reform law" as a cruel robbery of the people. The letter attacks the despicable means by which this bill was passed, which is a natural continuation of the Austrian government's current contradictory and irresponsible policies (policies of robbing the people and subjecting Austria to the domination and plundering of domestic and foreign capital). The upper echelons of the People's Party and the Socialist Party have pushed aside the last vestiges of independence and are obeying American orders. The letter forcefully states: "We (referring to the Austrian Communist Party) are breaking away from the Viktor Schärf government, which is destined for bankruptcy, in order to consolidate our position in the ranks of open and decisive struggle, unite with the masses, and strive to change Austria's political course." ACP spokesman Fischer attacked the government's policy in the ACP's newspaper "Volksstimme" on the 24th, saying that it "sacrifices Austria's independence and leads the country to destruction."
    [Another Dispatch] Workers in several factories in Vienna went on strike on the 20th to protest the "currency reform" that benefits American capital. In the afternoon, workers also held demonstrations, marching through the city center in formation, holding up signs that read "Down with currency reform" and "Currency reform is a deception." Thousands of poster workers plastered slogans on walls and billboards throughout the city on the 22nd, calling on the people to support the Communist Party in sweeping away the current government's deception and corruption. They also wrote in large characters: "If the government did not rely on foreign aid and was not corrupt, then you (referring to the people) would not be starving."

　　反对听命美国宰割人民
  　奥共宣布退出政府
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】维也纳讯：奥共反对奥政府在美国命令下施行“币制改革（按：该议案于二十日在议会通过），奥动力工业部长共产党人阿特曼纽为此宣布退出政府。奥共中央委员会书记处顷发表告全体党员书，谴责“币制改革法”为对人民之酷虐劫夺。该书抨击此法案通过时之卑鄙手段，乃奥国政府现时前后矛盾不负责任的全部政策（抢劫人民并将奥国听命国内外资本宰割的政策）的自然继续。人民党和社会党的上层分子，已推动了独立的最后威望，而服从美国的命令。该书力称：“我们（指奥共）脱离了注定刻要破产的维哥尔·谢尔夫政府，以便巩固自己在公开决定性斗争的行列，与群众结合，并争取改变奥国的政治路线。”奥共发言人费舍尔二十四日在奥共机关报“佛克斯·斯提姆”抨击政府的政策“是牺牲奥地利的独立，并引导国家至毁灭之境。”
    【又讯】维也纳若干工厂工人二十日举行罢工，抗议为美国资本谋利的“币制改革”。午后工人并举行示威，列队通过市中心，高举“打倒币制改革”、“币制改革是骗人的”标语。数千招贴工人于二十二日在全城屋墙与告示板上广贴标语，号召人民支持共产党以扫清现政府之欺骗与腐败。并大书：“倘若政府不倚赖外援和不腐化，则你们（按指人民）不至于挨饿。”
