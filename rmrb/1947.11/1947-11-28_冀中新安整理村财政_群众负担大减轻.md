Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀, 26th: Since July of this year, the village finances of Xin'an District, Xin'an County, Ji Zhong, have been greatly reduced. In the past, the village financial expenditures in this area were quite chaotic. Village cadres would eat at restaurants when attending meetings in the district, militiamen would fire guns indiscriminately and buy bullets casually. The highest expenditure was in Simenzhai Village, where the village funds alone amounted to 70 jin of millet per share annually; the lowest, such as Dongliuzhuang, was still 20 jin per share, and generally around 40 jin. The county government then used Xin'an District as a demonstration for unified planning. At the joint meeting of village cadres, they specifically discussed the unified planning method, stipulating the amount of expenditure for various villages. After the unified planning of the entire district, each share only required 5 jin of millet, which was greatly reduced compared to before. In the recent three months, after deducting all expenses, there was still a surplus of more than 2,000 jin of millet.

　　冀中新安整理村财政
  　群众负担大减轻
    【新华社晋察冀二十六日电】冀中新安县新安区村财政，自今年七月实行统筹后，群众负担大大减轻。按过去该区村财政开支相当紊乱，村干到区开会全吃饭馆，民兵乱打枪随便买子弹，出款最高的四门寨村，全年每分仅村款即达小米七十斤；最低的如东刘庄，每分款亦有二十斤，一般都在四十斤左右。县府乃以新安区为统筹示范，在村干联席会上，具体讨论统筹办法，规定各种村庄的开支数目，总计全区统筹后，每分仅出小米五斤，较前大大减少。最近三个月内，除去一切开支外，尚余二千余斤小米。
