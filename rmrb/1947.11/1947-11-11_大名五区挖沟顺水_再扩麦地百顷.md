　　【This Dispatch from Southern Hebei, 9th of the Month】Southeast of Zhongdajiang Village in the Fifth District of Yuan Dynasty, there was a water-collecting lake, occupying 350 mu of land, which held water nine years out of ten. Whenever the water receded, planting wheat for one year there would be particularly good. This year, under the call to plant more wheat, the village cadres and masses were determined to plant this sunken land. On the seventh day of the eighth month, led by Zhang Haotian and Liu Qunli, more than 40 young adults spent two days digging a water diversion ditch, three feet wide and deep, and more than 100 zhang long; but because the ground was too sunken and there was too much water, it flowed for three days without draining completely. The masses in the village were not discouraged and dug for two more sittings before slowly diverting the water out. They were afraid that the land would dry slowly and they would not be able to plant wheat early, so every household plowed it again. Not many days later, the land could be planted. Now, this vast expanse of water has turned into a lush green field of wheat seedlings. Whenever someone passes by here, especially old men, they always exclaim with admiration: "This piece of land could not be planted with wheat for nine years out of ten, but look how strong the wheat is! It seems that relying on heaven is really not as good as relying on people; diligent people don't have lazy land, these words make sense." This piece of land is 350 mu in total, and each mu can yield four or five big dou, it is estimated that next year the wheat harvest can be increased by more than 42,000 jin. Furthermore, around Changtun in the Fifth District of Daming, eight or nine villages were accumulating one or two chi of water after autumn rains due to proximity to the dam and several small dikes. The masses requested to work with the eight or nine villages in the Fourth District to dig ditches to divert water and plant wheat. More than 400 village cadres and masses from more than ten villages dug a river ditch that was eight chi wide at the top, four chi wide at the bottom, five chi deep, and more than six li long, connecting to the East Gully River. Under the leadership and inspection of district cadres, this arduous task was completed in three days. The water on the plain has flowed into the river, and most of the land has now been exposed. According to statistics, more than 100 qing of wheat can be planted. Now the masses are helping each other to sow the seeds.

　　大名五区挖沟顺水
    再扩麦地百顷
    【本报冀南九日电】元朝五区中大江村东南有个囤水湖，占据着三百五十亩地，十年九年存水。每逢水落，种上一年麦子，就特别好。今年在多种麦的号召下，该村干群决心种上这凹地。八月初七日，在张好田和刘群立的带头下，四十多个青壮年，经两天的工夫，挖了一条三尺宽深，一百多丈长的引水沟；但因地太凹，存水太多，流了三天没流净。该村群众并不灰心，又挖了两晌，才将水慢慢引出去。他们怕地干的慢，不能早种麦，家家都又锄了一遍。不几天，地能种了。现在这一片洋洋大水却变成了青葱葱的一片麦苗。每逢有人路过这里的人，尤其老头，总是赞叹的说：“这片地十年有九年种不上麦子，看麦子多强；看起来，靠天真不如靠人；人勤地不懒，这话说的有理。”这片地共三百五十亩，每亩可收四、五大斗，预计明年可增收麦四万二千多斤。又大名五区常屯周围八、九个村庄，因靠近大堤和数道小堤，秋雨时平地积水一、二尺。群众要求协同四区八、九村共同进行挖沟引水种麦。十余村村干群众四百人，挖成一上宽八尺，底宽四尺，深五尺，长六里余的河沟，通到东沟河沟。在区干部带头检查下，三天完成了这一艰巨任务。平地之水，已流入河内，大部土地现已露出。据统计，能种麦一百余顷。现群众正互助播种。
