　　Heyu Cooperative Credit Department
    Helping Poor Laborers with Winter Production
    [This newspaper, Yushe News] After Heyu Village in the Third District suffered severe hail damage this summer, the village cooperative went all out to provide famine relief, making precise calculations to make up for the losses. First, it organized all 25 donkeys in the village to find work in various parts of Wuxiang, earning a total of 430,000 yuan, which was immediately exchanged for 61 shi of rice. It also organized eight emancipated farmers to send sheep to Xingtai and Handan, earning 140,000 yuan, which was used to buy 21 shi of rice. Under the call for thrift, the village cooperative took the lead in mixing vegetables with rice to save grain and influenced the entire village to avoid waste during festivals, saving a total of 250,000 yuan, equivalent to 35 shi of rice. It organized a 100-day spinning and weaving campaign for women, with 77 people earning 52 shi of rice. A second 100-day spinning and weaving campaign, after deducting what was worn, earned 44 shi of rice. In July, it bought 1,600 jin of wool, planning to turn it into semi-finished and finished products, which could earn 30 shi of rice. After calculating the village's harvest in this way, there was still a shortage of 46 shi of grain and 350 shi of coarse grains, which it decided to make up for in this year's winter production. The specific plan is as follows: 1. Spinning and weaving: In addition to the elderly, everyone will be organized to spin 15 jin of cotton, plus 20 jin of wool. In addition to supplying raw materials and selling finished products, the cooperative will also establish small factories that do not separate from production, and add another hand-pulled machine (there are already five). 2. Transportation: Except for the elderly, young, and disabled, everyone will also be organized. Carriers and peddlers, 50 male laborers, are guaranteed to earn 1 million yuan. There are currently 20 donkeys, and another 12 will be developed, all for transportation. The cooperative provides credit loans to support poor laborers and repairs 10 ox carts to haul coal. 3. Semi-able-bodied laborers are organized to knit sweaters, with each person earning 10,000 yuan before the New Year. 4. The cooperative takes the lead in saving and preserving grain, ensuring that men do not use grain for pocket money and women do not use rice to weigh flowers. (Shi Ning, Rong Sheng)
