　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: News from various sources: The rampant armed intervention of U.S. imperialism in Greece has aroused widespread condemnation both within Greece and abroad, and a righteous Support-Greece movement is on the rise. The Greek Democratic Army broadcast vehemently denouncing the establishment of the U.S.-Greek Joint Chiefs of Staff, proving that "the United States is turning Greece into its colony, its anti-democratic and anti-Soviet military base, as well as a hotbed of unrest and a instigator of new wars." The South Communist Party's official newspaper, *Combat*, published an article titled "Wall Street Openly Organizes the Destruction of the Greek People," stating: "The establishment of the U.S.-Greek Joint Chiefs of Staff for land, sea, and air forces is a naked armed intervention by U.S. imperialism, and also demonstrates its weakness; because this ruthless armed intervention precisely proves its fear of the growing strength of the Greek democratic forces." The South, Bulgarian, Romanian, and Albanian trade union representatives' conference, held in Belgrade on the 19th, resolved to send a telegram to the World Federation of Trade Unions, suggesting that the federation order all member trade unions to launch a broad Support-Greece movement among the working people of the world, and to establish Support-Greece Standing Committees in various countries, to raise money and materials to provide the Greek people with material, spiritual, and political support. Under the initiative of the National Committee for Assisting the Greek People, major cities in Romania are preparing to convene a grand conference of all democratic groups to support Greece. The American Democratic Greek Committee in New York also held a mass protest rally on the 21st, unanimously passing a resolution emphasizing: "The majority of Americans oppose armed intervention in Greece and demand the withdrawal of all foreign troops and military personnel stationed in Greece, and an immediate halt to the shipment of military equipment to Greece. The Paris District Support-Greece Committee urges the United Nations to take full responsibility for the Greek people and immediately use its authority to stop U.S. armed intervention."

　　南保罗阿职工会议决议
  　发起广泛援希运动
    怒斥美帝武装干涉希腊
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】各方讯：美帝国主义对希腊的实行狂妄的武装干涉，已激起希腊国内外的一片怒斥声，一个正义的援希运动正在兴起。希民主军广播痛斥希美联合参谋总部的成立，证明“美国正将希腊变为它的殖民地，变为它反民主与反苏的军事基地，以及骚动的温床与新战争的挑拨者。”南共机关报战斗报以“华尔街公开组织毁灭希腊人民”为题撰文称：“美希陆海空军联合参谋部的成立是美帝国主义赤裸裸的武装干涉，也说明了它的脆弱；因为这种无情的武装干涉，正是证明它对希民主力量日益增长之恐惧。”南、保、罗、阿四国职工会代表会议于十九日在贝尔格莱德开会时，曾决议致电世界职工联盟，建议联盟通令各加盟职工会，在全世界劳动人民中发起广泛的援希运动，并在各国筹设援希常委会，着手募集钱物，予希腊人民以物质上、精神上以及政治上之支援。罗马尼亚各大城市正在援助希腊人民全国委员会之倡议下，筹备召开一切民主团体的援希盛大会议。纽约美国民主希腊委员会亦于二十一日召开群众抗议大会，一致通过决议，强调指出：“美国大多数人都反对武装干涉希腊，并要求撤退驻希一切外国军队及军事人员，立即停止运送军器赴希。巴黎区援希委员会吁请联合国应对希腊人民负全责，立即运用其权威，以制止美国的武装干涉。”
