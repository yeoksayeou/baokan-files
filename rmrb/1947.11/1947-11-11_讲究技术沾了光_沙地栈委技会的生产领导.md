　　Paying Attention to Technology Reaps the Benefits
    ——The Production Leadership of the Shadi Zhanwei Technical Committee
    After the emancipated peasants obtained land, they universally demanded to cultivate the land well and produce more grain. The Technical Committee of Shadi Zhan in the second district of Pingshun was re-established on this basis. Zhang Bianze, the production director of the village's labor hero Li Shunda, grasped the masses' demands and proposed that the masses study the advantages and disadvantages of paying attention to technology in the first month of the lunar year, summarizing the gains and losses of the previous year, which aroused the masses' attention to technology. The original Technical Committee was only in name, so it was decided to reorganize it. Nine people with agricultural experience and special skills were elected by the masses, and Bianze was elected as the director of the Technical Committee, Shunda as the deputy director, and two experienced all-around old men were found to participate in the leadership. A total of eleven people formed the Technical Committee.
    In order to ensure the thorough implementation of technical leadership, a technical committee member and an inspection committee member were selected from each mutual aid group, so that the technical committee members were closely integrated with the mutual aid groups. Whenever it was busy with farming, the technical committee first studied, and then convened the technical and inspection committee members of each group to discuss and study according to the situation of the village, and formulated methods, which were then returned to the group by them for discussion and implementation by the whole group, so that the leadership of the technical committee would not fall through.
    At the beginning of spring plowing, the Technical Committee first investigated what kinds of fertilizers and lands were available in the whole village. According to the different nature of the land and the nature of the fertilizer, it specifically studied what kind of land was suitable for what kind of fertilizer. When applying fertilizer, attention was paid to applying "hot" fertilizer (sheep manure, artemisia manure, donkey manure, etc.) to cold land (river land, ditch land, etc.), and "cold" fertilizer (pig manure, urine fertilizer, cattle trampled fertilizer, etc.) to hot land (sunny land). After research and publicity, the technical committee members took the lead, and the average fertilizer application per mu in the whole village was 90 dan. In terms of leading deep plowing and fine cultivation and exchanging seeds, 400 mu of land in the whole village were plowed and harrowed three times each, and 79.4 mu were plowed and harrowed twice each. Shunda's land was plowed and harrowed three times each. Comparing the harvest of households that exchanged seeds last year with those that did not, the masses realized the benefits of exchanging seeds. Wang Shize said: "I have experience in exchanging seeds. I am not afraid of replanting the stubble, but I am afraid that the grain will replant the stubble, just like people don't want to eat the same meal every day." The whole village exchanged one stone, four dou, and nine sheng of grain seeds. At the same time, cadres took the lead in improving tools and promoting improved varieties. When promoting the two-legged drill, the masses were afraid of producing less grain and were unwilling to use it. Shunda bought one from the district cooperative and planted his five mu of grain in large ridges. Only then did the masses follow suit. Shunda personally carried the drill to Beigou and Houbei to help people plant, and went to the village to mobilize people. As a result, 94.5 mu of grain were planted in large ridges. When promoting Jinhuanghou, because the technology was not emphasized last year, the harvest was reduced, and the masses lost confidence in Jinhuanghou. The Technical Committee found the land where Jinhuanghou was planted and explained to the masses the reasons for the low harvest last year. At the same time, Li Shunda planted six mu first, and Song Jinshan (mutual aid group leader) also planted four mu to give the masses courage. The whole village then followed suit and planted more than 80 mu.
    When weeding seedlings, the Technical Committee first divided the seedling fields of the whole village into three grades and set technical standards: For the first-grade low-lying ditch land, millet should be planted three plants per step, three to four plants per hole, with a distance of three to four fingers. Corn should be about two chi square, and Jinhuanghou should be two to two and a half chi. For medium-grade land, millet should be planted three plants per step, four to five plants per hole. For third-grade upland, millet should also be planted three plants per step, but five to six plants per hole, and 811 grain should be planted at a distance of eight cun to one chi. It was also studied that millet should be weeded, manure should be applied on top, and fresh seedlings should be selected. Millet should be selected with flat stalks, black stems, and generally the same height... The leadership method was that the technical committee members led the weeding in each group, and the inspectors were responsible for the inspection behind them. During the rest, the whole group would conduct inspections, discussions, evaluations, and revisions to unify the technical standards. After one weeding, fourteen experts were trained in the whole village. When topdressing the second and third weedings, the Technical Committee first studied the specific benefits of topdressing the third weeding and publicized and discussed it in the mutual aid groups. The technical committee members set an example. For example, Li Shunda first emptied the latrine, built the kang, scraped the walls... and topdressed Jinhuanghou and local corn. As a result, a total of 405.7 mu of land were weeded three times in the whole village, 74.4 mu of miscellaneous fields were weeded twice, and only 24 mu of land were not topdressed.
    During the three autumn campaigns, the Technical Committee first paid attention to seed selection. Li Shunda, Niu Yongqing, and others were assigned to select seeds in the fields themselves. A mass meeting was held that night to have the masses comment on the selected seeds. Then each household found seed land. After the whole village selected the seeds, 811 grain, Jinhuanghou, and various miscellaneous grains and local corn were all kept as seeds. When plowing the land to plant wheat, the Technical Committee set the plowing standard: The plowing should be level in the head, the end, and the bottom, so that the plowing can be done thoroughly without leaving a stubble. For small ridge grain, one plowing should be done for each ridge. For large ridge grain, one plowing should be done for three ridges. The plowing standard is three to four fingers. When planting wheat, everyone was told that there was a lot of autumn rain this year and the roots of the land were cold. In order for the wheat to sprout early, the seeds should be soaked in warm water and sunny land should be selected. The masses were urged to seize the day and plant early and select good varieties. Of the 19 mu of wheat in the whole village, 17.5 mu were planted with 169 wheat.
    On October 16th, the Technical Committee first summarized the production leadership of this year, and then the technical committee members brought it to the masses for deliberation. After comparison and summary, the masses unanimously believed that they had reaped great benefits. For example, Wang Shize said: "This year, paying attention to technology has reaped great benefits. My six fen of land in Moshigou and the cold land were fertilized with sheep manure. In the past, a good harvest was only more than one shi, but this year it has been more than one dou and six dou more." Zhang Xiaoke's river land was fertilized with sheep manure and planted with Jinhuanghou. In the past, this 1.7 mu of land only yielded four shi, but this year it yielded 34 bags of Jinhuanghou. Zhang Ping regretted saying: "Dashandi is sheep and hot land, but I didn't listen to the technical advice and fertilized it with donkey manure. As a result, the crops turned yellow and the seedlings were incomplete, and I suffered a great loss and produced less grain." Zhang Zhishen applied six levels of fertilizer to 1.5 mu and planted Jinhuanghou, yielding 31 bags. Zhang Zhiyu said: "I also applied six levels of fertilizer, but I didn't listen to the technical advice and planted local corn. 3.6 mu only yielded 30 bags, which is more land than others, but I didn't yield as much as others." Wang Zhou followed Shunda and used the two-legged drill and reaped great benefits. It saved labor and produced more grain. For example, it takes one work unit to weed one mu of small ridge grain, but three work units can weed two times of large ridge grain. At harvest time, large ridge grain takes eight fen of work unit per mu, but small ridge grain takes one work unit. Therefore, Niu Yongqing said: "Organizing ourselves in the past few years has reaped great benefits. In the past, everyone said that our village was a bitter vegetable ditch, but this year, after three plowings and three weedings, our village has become a no-weeds ditch."

　　讲究技术沾了光
    ——沙地栈委技会的生产领导
    翻身农民获得土地后，普遍要求种好地多打粮食，平顺二区沙地栈的技术委员会，就是在这个基础上重新建立起来的。该村劳英李顺达生产主任张扁则抓住群众要求，正月间整顿互助后，就提出让群众研究讲究技术的优缺点，总结一下去年收获的吃亏沾光，引起了群众对技术的重视。而原来的技委会只是有名无实，遂决定重新组织。由群众选出农业耕作有经验和有特殊技能的九个人，并选扁则为技术主任，顺达为副主任，又找出两个有经验的全把式老汉参加领导，共十一个人组成了技术委员会。
    为了保证技术领导的贯澈执行，又从每个互助组选出技术委员检查委员各一人，使技委员与互助组密切结合起来，每当农忙时，先由技委会研究，再召集各组技术和检查委员，根据本村情况讨论研究，订出办法，再经他们回到组内，由全组讨论执行，使技委会的领导不致落空。
    春耕开始，技委会首先调查了全村都有那几种肥，那几种地，根据地的性质和肥的性质的不同，具体研究出那种地适宜上那种肥。上肥时都注意到寒地（河地、背沟地等）上火肥（羊肥、蒿肥、驴肥等），火地（向阳地）上寒肥（猪肥、＠肥、牛踩肥等），经过研究宣传，技术委员带头，全村每亩地平均上肥九十担。在领导深耕细作调换种子方面，全村耢、犁各三遍的有四百亩，各两遍的有七九．四亩，顺达的地耢、犁都是三遍。又从对比去年换种户与不换种户的收成使群众认识了换种子的好处，王狮则就说：“我有换种子经验，不怕覆茬谷，就怕谷覆茬，就象人每天一直吃一样饭也是不想吃一样。”全村调换谷种一石四斗九升。同时干部带头，改良工具，推广优良品种，在推广两条腿耧时，群众都怕少打粮不愿使，顺达便自己到区联社买来一张，把自己的五亩多谷都种成大垅，群众才跟着种，顺达又亲自背上耧到北沟、后背去帮人种，又到村上去动员，结果种了大垅谷九十四亩五分。在推广金黄后时，因为去年种的没讲技术，降低了收成，群众便对金黄后没信心，技委会一面找出了种金黄后的地，一面把去年少收的原因讲给群众听，同时李顺达先种上六亩，宋金山（互助组长）也种了四亩给群众仗胆，全村便跟上种了八十多亩。
    锄苗时，技委会首先把全村苗地分成三等，定出技术标准：一等下稍沟洼地谷子是一步三安，每安三棵至四棵，距离三指至四指远。玉茭方圆二尺左右，金黄后是二尺至二尺半。中等地谷一步三安，每安四棵到五棵，三等上稍地每步也是三安，但每安要五棵到六棵，八一一谷是八寸到一尺的距离。又研究出谷锄寸顶上粪，留苗要挑新鲜的，谷要选扁秆茎黑色一般高的等……领导办法是技术委员到各组领锄，检查员在后边负责检查，休息时再进行全组性的检查讨论评判修改，统一做到技术标准。经过一次锄苗，全村培养出来十四个把式。在锄二、三遍苗上追肥时，首先在技委会研究出锄三遍上追肥的具体好处，到互助组里宣传讨论，技术委员起模范，如李顺达自己首先掏茅厕、打炕、刮墙……把金黄后、土玉茭都上了追肥。结果全村锄三遍的共四○五．七亩，锄两遍的杂田七四．四亩，没上追肥的地只有二十四亩。
    突击三秋时，技委会首先注意了选种，先由李顺达、牛永清等六人分工亲自到地里选种，当晚召开群众大会，把选出的各种种子交群众评论，然后各户都找出种子地，经过全村群众性的挑选，八一一谷、金黄后及各种杂谷土玉茭都留下种子。犁地种麦时，技委会又订出犁地标准：犁地要：拖头、司头、犁底三平，才能犁好犁透不留一个茬。小垅谷每犁照一垅，大垅谷一耧犁三犁，犁地标准是三指到四指、种麦中又告诉大家，今年秋雨多地根寒，为了麦子早上，要温水浸种选择朝阳地，并推动群众抢天早种，选用好品种，全村正茬麦中十九亩内即有一六九小麦十七亩半。
    十月十六日技委会先对这一年的生产领导做了总结，然后由技术委员带到群众中去酝酿，经过比较总结，群众一致认为沾了大光，如王狮则说：“今年讲究技术沾了光，我磨石沟六分地和寒地，今年听话上了羊火肥，往年好收才打一石多，今年就打了大斗一石六斗多。”张小科河地上了羊肥种了金皇后，往年这一亩七分地只收四石，今年就撇了三十四口袋金皇后，张平则后悔的说：“大扇地是羊火地，不听技术话上了驴肥，结果庄稼发黄苗不全，吃了大亏少打粮”。张芝申一亩五分上六等地，种金皇后撇三十一布袋，张芝玉说：“我也是上六等地，不听技术话，种上土玉茭，三亩六分才撇了三十口袋，比人家地多可没人家撇的多。”王周则跟上顺达用两条腿耧沾了大光，又省工还多打粮，如小垅谷锄一亩就得一个工，大垅谷三个工就能锄两遍，收割时大垅谷每亩用八分工，小垅谷就得一个工，所以牛永清说：“这几年组织起来就是沾了大光，过去都说咱村是苦苦菜沟，今年经过三犁三锄，咱村已变成了没草沟了”。（双红、王考、之林、思贤）
