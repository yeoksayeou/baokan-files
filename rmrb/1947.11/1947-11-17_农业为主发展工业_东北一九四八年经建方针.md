　　Agriculture as the Foundation, Developing Industry
  　Northeast China's Economic Construction Policy for 1948
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 10th] The Northeast China Financial and Economic Conference has determined the economic construction policy for the Northeast Liberated Areas in 1948, which is to take agriculture as the foundation to develop agriculture and industry. Based on the development of public and private economies to increase national and people's wealth, the aim is to continue to support large-scale self-defense war, consolidate and expand the liberated areas, and gradually improve the people's lives. To this end, the basic requirements for current economic construction are:
    (1) Vigorously develop agriculture, making increased grain production the primary central task, and develop cotton, hemp, special products, and rural sideline occupations to ensure that our liberated areas have abundant grain and industrial products.
    (2) Restore and develop essential industries and mines, electric power, railway transportation, and transportation industries. Among industries and mines, military industry, military supplies, textiles, cotton picking, coal mining, gold mining, steel, and electric power are the priorities to ensure the needs of war support and the people's livelihood.
    (3) Support the development of private industries, guarantee legitimate private industrial and commercial enterprises, make them profitable, and benefit the people's liberation war.
    (4) Manage foreign trade, strengthen the economic struggle against the US-Chiang reactionaries, develop people's cooperative businesses and commerce in the liberated areas, and eliminate the excess profits of monopolistic speculative businesses to ensure the appropriate interests between producers and consumers.
    (5) Developing production in cities and villages, in public and private enterprises, will become the central link of mass movements in the future, integrating production with mass movements, improving the enthusiasm of the masses for labor, strictly enforcing labor discipline, strengthening the organization of labor, improving production skills, and promoting and training new technical cadres in production.
    (6) Gradually increase the capital accumulation of public, cooperative, and private economies to promote the continued development of the new democratic economy.
