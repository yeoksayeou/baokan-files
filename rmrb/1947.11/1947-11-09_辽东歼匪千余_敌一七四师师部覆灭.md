Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 7th. Following the annihilation of the Jiang bandit 92nd Army's 21st Division west of Yixian, at dawn on the second day (the 4th), a certain cavalry unit of the People's Liberation Army annihilated the Jiang bandit 174th Division headquarters and two regiments at Xujia Township, 50 li northeast of Jinzhou. Over 1,200 enemy officers and soldiers were captured alive. The enemy division commander, Yu Dachuan, escaped with only a few followers. Detailed battle results are still being tallied. In this battle, our army only suffered a little over ten casualties, creating a brilliant example of a 100:1 kill ratio. It is reported that the enemy's 174th Division was reorganized from the Northeast Security 4th Detachment.
