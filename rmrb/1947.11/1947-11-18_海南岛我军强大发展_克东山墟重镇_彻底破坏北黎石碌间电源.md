Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. According to reports revealed by the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao on the 13th and 15th of last month, the active activities of the people's armed forces in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces have greatly alarmed the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Zeng Sanxing, secretary-general of the Guangdong Provincial Party Department of the Kuomintang, confessed that the People's Liberation Army under the command of General Feng Baiju had successively captured the cities of Baoting, Baisha, and Ledong counties and Dongshan Market, an important town in Qiongshan County, on Hainan Island, and the power supply between Beili and Shilu had also been completely destroyed by our army. Sanxing lamented: "The 'bandit situation' on Hainan Island has further deteriorated." In order to cope with the vigorous activities of the people's armed forces in Guangdong and Guangxi, the Chiang Kai-shek authorities formally established the "Guangdong-Guangxi Southern District '剿匪' [Suppressing Bandits] General Headquarters" in Zhanjiang (i.e., Guangzhou Bay) in the middle of last month. Chen Pei, director of the Guangdong Chiang Kai-shek Security Police, was appointed as the commander-in-chief. Relevant departments and offices of the Chiang Kai-shek Provincial Government and the Chiang Kai-shek Provincial Party Department sent personnel to participate in the General Headquarters, and convened a meeting of the heads of the Chiang Kai-shek party, government, and military in the seventh and eighth districts of Guangdong Province to discuss ways to deal with the people's armed forces. In southeastern Guangxi, where the people's armed forces are active, many Chiang Kai-shek county magistrates have been removed from their posts. On the 8th of last month, the Chiang Kai-shek Guangxi Provincial Affairs Conference passed a resolution to remove Tang Zhihao, the county magistrate of Quan County, Hu Qi, the county magistrate of Lingchuan County, Lin Feng, the county magistrate of Feng County, Huang Baofang, the county magistrate of Rong County, and Ruan Riqing, the county magistrate of Tianyang County, from their posts on the grounds of "dereliction of duty," "ineffective work," and "abandoning their posts."

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 15th. According to the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao of October 27, the Changzhou people's armed forces shot and killed Jing Song, an evil monk who went to the countryside to collect rent for the big landlord Tianning Temple, on October 2. On the 23rd, two monks from the temple, Ding Chao and Yong Fa, went to the countryside separately by boat to collect rent. The people's armed forces captured them again, returned all the rent grain to the tenants, and burned all the two rental boats and account books. Ding Chao was executed for his heinous crimes, and Yong Fa was warned and released after interrogation. That night, the people's armed forces took advantage of the victory to attack Zhaiqiao Town in the seventh district of Changzhou, posting slogans against conscription, requisition of grain, and feudal exploitation.

  　克东山墟重镇
    彻底破坏北黎石碌间电源
    【新华社陕北十六日电】综合沪大公报上月十三日及十五日透露消息，粤桂两省人民武装之积极活动，已使蒋匪当局大感惊慌。蒋党广东省党部书记长曾三省供称：海南岛之保亭、白沙、乐东三县城及琼山县要镇东山墟已先后为冯白驹将军所部人民解放军攻占，北黎、石碌间电源亦被我军彻底破坏。三省悲鸣：“海南岛‘匪息’又更加恶化”。蒋匪当局为应付粤桂人民武装蓬勃的活动，已于上月中旬在湛江（按即广州湾）正式成立“粤桂南区‘剿匪’总指挥部”，由广东蒋匪保警处长陈沛任总指挥官，蒋匪省政府有关厅处及蒋党省党部均派员参加总指挥部，并已召集粤省第七八两区蒋匪党政军负责人开会讨论对付人民武装办法。人民武装活动地区之桂东南，许多蒋匪县长均被撤职，上月八日蒋匪广西省务会议通过：全县县长唐志豪、灵川县长胡琦、凤县县长林锋、容县县长黄葆芳、田阳县长阮日清等均免职，其理由为“职务废弛”、“办事不力”及“放弃职守”等。
    【新华社华东十五日电】据十月二十七日沪大公报载：常州人民武装，十月二日击毙大地主夭宁寺下乡收租恶僧镜松。二十三日该寺僧人定超、永法二人又乘船分头下乡收租，人民武装又将其俘获，并将租谷全部退还佃户，租船两只与帐册悉数焚毁。定超因罪大恶极被枪决，永法经审问后警告释放。是夜人民武装乘胜攻入常州七区寨桥镇，张贴反抽丁、反征粮、反对封建剥削等标语。
