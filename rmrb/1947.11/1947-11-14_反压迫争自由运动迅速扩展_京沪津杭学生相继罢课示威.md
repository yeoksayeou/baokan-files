　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 11th: The just movement of students in the Jiang-controlled areas against oppression and for freedom is rapidly expanding in the heartland of the Jiang bandits. According to the Associated Press, Shanghai, November 10th: Zhejiang University in Hangzhou has announced another week-long strike. At the same time, strike actions are surging in Shanghai. Jiaotong University, which was once disbanded by the Jiang bandits in July this year, bravely went on strike on the 8th. St. John's University, a church school, announced a one-day strike on the 11th and issued a declaration demanding that the Jiang bandits release arrested students from various Jiang-controlled areas, announce the truth about the murder of Yu Zisan, a martyr of Zhejiang University, and called on students to rise up and fight for the freedom of survival, speech, and study without interference. The emotions of the school's more than two thousand students were extremely激昂, and the campus was full of slogans denouncing Jiang Jieshi for assassinating students and professors. A photograph of Yu Zisan, a martyr of Zhejiang University, after his murder was hung high on the bulletin board. A slogan next to the image pointed out: Torture marks have been found on the body of Martyr Yu, and these evidences powerfully prove that the deceased was murdered by the Jiang bandits rather than committing suicide. Some professors and school workers participated in the school's strike. According to the United Press, Beiping, November 10th: One of the students who was beaten and hospitalized by the Jiang bandit's San Qing Tuan secret agents on the 6th has worsened and is in critical condition. The Jiang bandit's Beiping Pacification Headquarters has also issued new prohibitions, restricting students from traveling between schools in groups of more than ten, in an attempt to disintegrate the student movement in Beiping.
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 12th】According to various sources, the just struggle of students in Jiang-controlled areas against oppression and for freedom is developing. Tianjin Nankai University and other schools have been on strike since the 6th, and students at Nanjing Central University also went on strike for a period of time. The Jiang bandits' crimes of arresting and massacring people in various places have not stopped. According to a TASS dispatch from Shanghai on November 11th, citing the Dagong Bao: On the 4th of this month, the Jiang bandit's Guilin authorities shot and killed eleven citizens. According to the Tianjin Yishibao earlier this month, more than 100 citizens in Shenyang were arrested by the Jiang bandits last month.
