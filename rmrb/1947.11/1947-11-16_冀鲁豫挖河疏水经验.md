Hebei-Shandong-Henan Experiences in Dredging Rivers and Diverting Water
    In the past two years, this region has experienced abundant rainfall, leading to floods. Last year, over 100,000 hectares of land were submerged. The fertile fields of Weinanpo and Zhaocunpo in Puyang, amounting to five to six thousand mu, were entirely transformed into waterlogged areas. The Administrative Office dispatched a large number of cadres to flood-stricken areas to work with local governments in leading the digging of ditches to channel water and expand the area for wheat planting. The following are some brief experiences in dredging rivers and diverting water:

(1) Understanding the water's flow and determining the river course is the main key to resolving and channeling water. Beforehand, it is best to cooperate with relevant local cadres to thoroughly survey the river from beginning to end, and based on the historical experience of the masses, conduct detailed research and discussions on historical materials, such as inscriptions and old county chronicles' "River Dredging" sections, to determine the river course and its dimensions.

(2) Finding a basis for determining the river course: A. Based on the spirit of "water flows downward," try to dredge in low-lying areas; B. Strive to shorten the river course distance to save labor and land; C. The river course should be as straight as possible, avoiding excessive bends, so that water can flow smoothly.

(3) Overcome departmentalism among cadres and the masses, raise awareness, and strengthen confidence: Some cadres, starting from local interests, have strong departmentalist ideas that affect the overall situation. Coupled with busy war support and production tasks, they lack sufficient understanding of digging ditches and channeling water and lack experience, so they are not bold and lack confidence. The leadership must explain that the government will never favor one over the other, and call on cadres and the masses to broaden their horizons and obey the overall situation, learning from the lesson of 100,000 hectares being submerged last year. As long as the cadres and the masses are ideologically mobilized, the work will proceed rapidly.

(4) Clearly define responsibilities and closely integrate the work area with the interests of the local masses. Before assigning tasks, thoroughly understand the relationship between the masses and this work, some being entirely beneficial, some being beneficial and harmful in equal measure, some being absolutely without benefit, and some even being harmful. In assigning sections and tasks, efforts should be made to closely link the work area with the interests of the masses, so as to give play to their enthusiasm. The division of labor should be clear and specific, with conspicuous markers for easy differentiation, so as to avoid misunderstandings and unnecessary disputes.

(5) The organization of labor should be small, efficient, and capable. This autumn, digging rivers, scooping mud from the water, building dams, and diverting water is relatively troublesome and laborious. The organization of labor must be suitable for the requirements of the project. Wei River experience: Each unit should not exceed one hundred people at most, with about fifty people being better. This way, command is flexible, forces are concentrated, and the work area is not too large, so the dynamic forces of the water inside and outside the dam are relatively small, avoiding wasting effort.

(6) Make thorough preparations and specific plans for the supply of civilian laborers. It is often seen that civilian laborers waste a lot of resources because the supply is not well planned. Sometimes, too much cooked food is prepared in hot weather and cannot be eaten in time, causing fermentation and spoilage. White flour also becomes moldy due to humidity. The leadership must clarify the work time and location and make detailed plans for how much cooked and raw grain to bring. Sufficient attention must also be paid to firewood. Carefully understand the price of firewood around the work area, calculate the conversion, and determine whether to bring it yourself or buy it.

(7) Pay attention to saboteurs, expose rumors, and focus on education. When digging the Majia River, bad guys spread rumors and intimidated people, saying: "It's terrible, the Yellow River is coming soon! The higher-ups told us to dig the river quickly to prepare to guide the Yellow River over!" The masses were momentarily extremely frightened and asked about the Yellow River at length. After the leadership discovered this, they promptly exposed it, explained and educated, and the masses' emotions stabilized. As for publicity and education work, air defense issues, and living hygiene, attention must also be paid to these according to the working environment and time, and negligence and 麻痹 must not be tolerated. When work begins, the leadership should actively give play to the creativity of the masses. As long as the masses receive enlightenment and education, their creativity is great. In addition, the follow-up work must be done well, and the work must be done from beginning to end, with a clear start and finish. For example, how much land was damaged, how much material and grain was used, how the bridges should be repaired, and other necessary procedures must be clarified at the time to avoid not being able to clear the accounts after the time has passed, which would affect the normal work of the departments.

　　冀鲁豫挖河疏水经验
    本区两年来雨量繁多，遭致水灾。去年淹了十万余顷地。濮阳卫南坡、赵村坡五、六千亩肥沃良田，全部变为水区，行署曾调大批干部到各水灾区配合当地政府领导挖沟顺水，扩大种麦面积。兹将挖河疏水点滴经验介绍如下：（一）了解水势，确定河线，是解水顺水工作的主要关键。事前最好配合有关地方干部沿河澈头澈尾勘查，根据群众历史经验，对找历史材料，如碑志、旧县志“河疏类”详细研究、讨论，确定河线及其尺度大小；（二）确定河线找根据：甲、根据“水性就下”的精神，尽量找嵋上地区疏浚；乙、力求缩短河线距离，节约劳力土地；丙、河线尽可能取直，不要多弯曲，使水不得畅流。（三）克服干群本位思想，提高认识，坚定信心：有些干部从局部利害出发，带有浓厚的本位观念，影响整体，加以战勤、生产任务繁忙，因此对挖沟顺水没有足够的认识，又缺乏经验，于是不大胆，缺乏信心，领导上必须说明政府决不厚此薄彼，“打哭一个引笑一个”，号召干部群众眼光放大，服从整体，去年被淹十万顷的教训，要广泛宣传动员，只要干群思想发动起来，工作即会迅速展开。（四）分工明确，注意工作地段与当地群众利益密切结合。未分工前，彻底了解群众对此工作的利害关系，有的完全有利，有的利害参半，有的绝对无益，有的甚至有害。在分段分工中，应尽量使工作地段与群众利益密切联系，以便发挥其积极性，分工要明确具体，插标显明易别，不致发生误会与不必要的争执。（五）组织力量要短小精干，今年秋季挖河，水里捞泥打坝疏水是比较麻烦吃力的，组织力量时必须适合工程的要求，卫河经验：每单位最多不能超过一百人，以五十人左右较好，这样指挥灵活，力量集中，工作范围不太大，坝内外水的动荡力量比较小，不致浪费力量。（六）民工给养要周密准备，具体计划，常常看到民工因给养没有很好计划，浪费很大，有的热天备熟粮多，一时吃不了，发酵霉坏，白面也因潮湿而发霉，领导上必须将工作时间地点明确起来，详尽计划须带多少熟粮、生粮。烧柴也得相当注意，仔细了解工作周围的柴价，折合计算，确定自带或购买。（七）注意奸细破坏，揭发谣言，抓紧教育。挖马颊河时，坏家伙造谣恫吓说：“可不好了，黄河快过来了，上级叫赶快挖河，就是准备引导黄河过来的！”群众一时惊惶异常，询问黄河长黄河短，领导上发觉后，及时揭破，解释教育，群众情绪才稳定下来。至于宣传教育工作、防空问题、生活卫生，根据工作环境、时间，亦须注意不可疏忽麻痹。在动工时，领导上应积极发挥群众的创造性，群众只要受到启发教育，创造性是很大的。另外，善后工作必须作好，工作要善始善终，有头有尾。如挖坏了多少地，用了多少材料财粮，桥梁怎样修法，及其他应办手续，一定当时弄清楚，以免过时算不清帐，影响部门经常工作。（冀鲁豫分社）
