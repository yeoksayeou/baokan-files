　　Carrying Poles, Gathering Firewood, Transporting Goods, Digging Up Medicinal Herbs
  　Do Whatever You Can, Don't Mind Earning Little
    [Reported by our newspaper from Yushe] The Liu Central Production Team in Dengyu Fourth District held a meeting on the eighth of this month to discuss how to carry out winter production. An old man named Song Chenglin said, "Let's do whatever we are capable of. Young people have the strength to carry. They can carry sandstone pots and engage in transportation. We are old and can gather firewood, collect manure, and dig up medicinal herbs. As long as we work, whether much or little, we can always earn something!" Song Erze said, "Knitting sweaters and twining yarn are the most profitable, and livestock transportation earns even more!" Then, with everyone chiming in, they had a lively discussion, and from individuals to groups to the entire team, they all formulated winter production plans: The entire team has twelve livestock, driven by six people, transporting foot-goods and coal back and forth from Chengguan to Hongshui, which can earn more than 160,000 yuan in two and a half months. Six people knitting sweaters, each knitting six pieces in two and a half months, can earn more than 90,000 yuan. Fifteen old men specialize in gathering firewood and collecting manure, gathering fifty catties of firewood and half a dan of manure each day. In two and a half months, they can earn more than 130,000 yuan from firewood and collect 720 dan of manure. Two people carding cotton and wool can earn 92,000 yuan. Two carpenters cutting and selling spinning wheel machines can earn 50,000 yuan. The entire team plans to press oil on twenty-five xiang of land, which can earn 50,000 yuan from oil and 10,000 yuan from sesame cakes. In addition, there is digging up medicinal herbs, etc. It is estimated that at least more than 500,000 yuan can be earned. This is now actively underway. (Bing An, San Cheng, Ming Qi, Yun Shu)
    [Reported by our newspaper from Xiyang] After each household, each group, and each team in the Li Village First District calculated their assets and compared their harvests, they broke the thinking of "live for today and worry about tomorrow when it comes." The entire village has 1,445 people, each needing five he of grain per day (minimum living standard), totaling one shi and eight dou per year, requiring a total of 2,646 shi of grain. The entire village can harvest a total of 1,843 shi and four dou of grain, plus the border grain funds, totaling a shortage of 1,066 shi and six dou. Everyone discussed and came up with solutions to make up for the shortfall: (1) Plant 720 mu of wheat, estimated at four dou per mu, totaling 288 shi. (2) The entire village will organize 136 donkeys to engage in transportation during the three winter months (semi-labor force driving livestock), each earning one shi of grain, totaling 136 shi. (3) The entire village has eight coal kilns, with 184 workers. Each kiln earns 50 shi, totaling 400 shi. (4) The cooperative will establish a coal station in Yetao, organizing full labor to fully carry and transport, which will sell coal and earn money from transportation; also, twelve mules carrying foot-goods, totaling 242 shi, which can make up for the deficit. Their leadership is centered on the production committee, with team leaders responsible for scoring, calculating work points, and distributing dividends, etc. The cooperative is responsible for sales and hiring carriers. Their slogans are: "Work hard and diligently, carry coal and sell charcoal, if there are difficulties, everyone helps, those who cause trouble and stir up things, will starve to death." In textiles, there are 21 looms and 32 weavers, and 150 spinning wheels. They are studying the combination of weaving and spinning, and have established a textile committee, striving for everyone to spin and everyone to weave, to be self-sufficient in clothing. Under the leadership of the production committee and the branch committee, the entire village is buying large carts or preparing oxcarts and donkey transports, and is now enthusiastically starting to take action.

    【本报榆社讯】四区邓峪刘中央生产队本月八号集会，讨论如何开展冬季生产，老汉宋成林说：“咱们会干什的就干什，青年人有力气能担，可以担砂锅、搞运输，俺们老了，可拾柴、拾粪、刨药材，只要劳动，没多有少，总能赚钱！”宋二则说：“打毛衣、闹毛线最有利，牲口运输更赚钱！”接着，你一言我一语，开展了热烈的讨论，从个人到组到全队，全部订出了冬季生产计划：全队十二个牲口，由六个人赶，从城关到洪水来回驮脚驮煤，两个半月可赚洋十六万余元。六人打毛衣，两个半月每人打六件，可赚洋九万余元。十五个老汉专门拾柴、拾粪，每天拾柴五十斤，拾粪半担，两个半月拾柴可赚洋十三万余元、可拾粪七百二十担。两个人弹花、弹毛，可赚洋九万二千元。两个木匠割卖纺车机子等可赚洋五万元。全队计划榨油二十五晌，油可赚五万元，麻饼可赚洋一万元，还有刨药材等，以上估计最低可赚洋五十余万元。现正积极进行中。（秉安、三成、鸣崎、运书）
    【本报昔阳讯】一区李家庄经过各户各组各队算家当比收成，打破了“有吃且过活，吃完再想法”的思想。全村一千四百四十五口人，每人一天五合粮计（最低生活），一年一石八斗，总共需粮二千六百四十六石。全村共能收粮一千八百四十三石四斗，加上边粮款，总共短一千零六十六石六斗。当由大家讨论，想出弥补办法：（一）种麦七百二十亩，每亩以四斗计，共能收二百八十八石。（二）全村共组织驴一百卅六头，在冬三月中搞运输（半劳力赶牲口），每一头能赚一石粮，共赚一百卅六石。（三）全村有煤窑八座，工人一百八十四人，每座窑赚五十石，共能赚四百石。（四）合作社到冶陶成立煤炭站，组织全劳力全力担运，这样又能销出煤炭，又能担运赚钱；还有十二条骡驮脚，共能赚二百四十二石，这样能够弥补起亏数。他们的领导是以生产委员会为核心，各队长负责评分计工分红等工作，合作社负责销售、雇脚。他们的口号是：实干苦干，担煤卖炭，有了困难，大家帮办，挑皮捣蛋，饿死也不管。在纺织上，共有织机廿一架，三十二个织妇，有一百五十架纺车，研究织纺结合，并成立纺织委员会，争取人人会纺，人人会织，穿衣自给。在生产委员会和支委会的领导下，全村有的买大车，或准备牛车，驴驮，现已热烈开始行动。（叩成、忠善、芝正、三良、维政）
