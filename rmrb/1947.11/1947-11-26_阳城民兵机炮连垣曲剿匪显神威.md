Taiyue, 24th (This Newspaper) The newly established machine gun and artillery company of the Yangcheng Militia displayed its power for the first time in suppressing bandits in Nishan, Yuanqu. On the 5th of this month, the Yangcheng machine gun and artillery company followed the Yangcheng Militia Field Team to the southwest mountains of Yuanqu to suppress the Chiang bandit Liu Han-san's troops. When they discovered that Liu's bandits were gathering in Nishan, they immediately opened fire with their artillery, and six shells routed Liu's bandits, and our militia occupied the mountain. The next day, Liu's bandits gathered their remnants to give a speech, attempting a desperate struggle. Our militia gunners fired at them again. The first shot hit Liu's bandit sentry post, and the second and third shots exploded in the bandit crowd. The bandits scattered and fled, and we immediately pursued them. According to Zhao Xihan, the captured second squadron leader of Liu's bandits, Liu Han-san was gathering his remnants to give a speech: "Don't be afraid, these are just militia blindly setting off landmines!" Before he could finish speaking, a shell exploded in front of him, and Liu's bandits immediately panicked and said, "Ah! This is terrible, run! Run!" and then scattered and fled.

　　阳城民兵机炮连垣曲剿匪显神威
    【本报太岳二十四日电】阳城民兵新成立的机炮连，在垣曲尼山剿匪中初显神威。阳城机炮连，于本月五日，随从阳城民兵野战队至垣曲西南山，清剿蒋匪刘汉三部，当发现刘匪在尼山聚集时，即发炮射击，六发炮弹即将刘匪击溃，我民兵即占领山头。次日刘匪集其残部训话，企图作垂死挣扎，我民兵炮手又向其射击，第一发击中刘匪哨位，接连第二、三发，都在匪群里爆炸。匪众四散奔逃，我即跟踪追击。据被俘之敌刘匪二分队长赵西汉供称，刘汉三正集合残部训话：“不要害怕，这是民兵瞎放地雷啦！”话还没说完，炮弹已在面前爆炸，刘匪马上惊慌失措的说：“啊！不得了，快跑！快跑！”遂四散奔逃。
