　　Heroes Who Defended Daigu
　　Hu Fenggao, the battalion commander of the First Battalion of the Lu Central Guard, commanded the First Company to defend Daigu (sixty li east of Xintai) for forty-two days against the combined land and air attacks of an enemy several times its size. At the cost of ten casualties, they killed and wounded more than two hundred enemies, successfully completing the blocking mission.
　　When Chiang Kai-shek's bandits launched a "key offensive" against the Yimeng Mountain area, Battalion Commander Hu was ordered to command the First Company to defend Daigu. Their slogan was: "As long as we are here, Daigu is here. We will hold up the pillar of Lu Central China and strive to be heroes of Daigu, the Daigu Company." On June 27th, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits began to attack the mountain. First, twelve aircraft and an artillery regiment concentrated their bombing and shelling, followed by nearly two divisions of troops rushing up from all directions. The mountain fortifications were shrouded in shrapnel and smoke. The heroes defending Daigu calmly held their grenades and waited. When a squad of enemies climbed onto Guangyan, grenades were thrown into the enemy crowd like hail. Only three members of the enemy squad were left to roll down the mountain. Then the second and third attacks were crushed.
　　Seeing that a hard attack was not working, the Chiang army tried to shake them with appeasement tactics, but two or three messengers were beaten back. They then used armed escorts to shout, but were scolded back into silence by the heroes. The enemy, enraged, burned down the houses around Daigu, drove away the masses, and built fortifications on the large and small hills around Daigu, implementing a long-term siege, often stationing more than a brigade of troops around Daigu.
　　When the heroes had persisted for more than twenty days, supplies became difficult. When there was no rice, they gathered wild grass to eat. When there was no firewood to burn, they drank cold water. When it rained, the mountain was constantly covered in fog, and they wrung out their clothes to dry them. During continuous cloudy days, mountain water flooded into the caves, sometimes reaching a depth of one person. Everyone put wooden boards on the water surface as beds, taking turns bailing water and taking turns sleeping. This lasted for a whole week. During these difficult days, the leading comrades found people to tell stories of the Red Army's Long March, the stories of model party member Chen Shan persisting in the Zulai Mountain area, and past stories of counter-"sweeps," greatly encouraging everyone's determination to persist to the end. Even when the sick and wounded ate cold rice soaked in salt water, they were very satisfied, saying: "It's much better than Comrade Chen Shan in Zulai Mountain hanging a jar around his neck to climb down the mountain to find water, and not seeing food for four or five days."
　　In order to better defend the mountain fortress and defeat the enemy's siege, Battalion Commander Hu led more than twenty particularly strong warriors down the mountain, using guerrilla warfare to cooperate with the troops defending the fortress. They shattered the enemy's bunker siege, and successively defeated four or five Chiang Kai-shek "Homecoming Corps" in Zhanyan, Zhangzi Mountain, and other places. They also worked with local cadres around them who persisted in the struggle to open up the situation in three districts, and provided supplies to Daigu. Battalion Commander Hu was originally a second-class disabled soldier, but he always took the lead in enduring hardship, encouraging everyone with his exemplary actions. He carried grain up the mountain with everyone, saying that the more he carried, the more days Daigu could eat. When camping, he always asked everyone to rest first, and he himself stood guard. This persisted until the forty-second day, finally forcing the enemy to withdraw dejectedly.
　　In order to commend the heroes' glorious achievements and tenacious spirit, the Lu Central Military Region has awarded the battalion commander the honorary title of "Daigu Hero" and the company the honorary title of "Daigu Company."

### 坚守岱崮的英雄们

　　坚守岱崮的英雄们
    鲁中监护第一营营长胡凤诰指挥下的第一连，在数十倍于己的敌人陆空联合进攻下，坚守岱崮（新泰东六十余里）血战四十二天，以伤亡十人的代价杀伤敌二百余名，胜利完成了阻击任务。
    蒋匪向沂蒙山区作“重点进攻”时，胡营长奉命指挥第一连守岱崮。他们的口号是：“人在崮就在，守住鲁中撑天柱，争取作岱崮英雄岱崮连”。六月二十七日，蒋匪开始攻山，首先以十二架飞机和一个炮兵团集中狂炸与轰击后，继掩护将近两个师的兵力，从四面八方冲上来，山上工事被弹片烟雾笼罩住了，守崮的英雄们，沉着地握住手榴弹等候着，待敌人一个班爬上光岩时，手榴弹象冰雹一样投到敌人群里，敌人一个班只剩了三个人滚下山去。接着二次、三次进攻都被打垮了。
    蒋军见硬攻不行，又想用软化手段动摇他们，可是两三次送信，都被打回去，继以武装掩护喊话，结果反被英雄们斥骂得无言而退。敌人恼羞成怒，把崮周围的民房烧光，把群众赶走，在崮周围大小山头，修筑起工事，实行长期围困，经常用一个旅以上的兵力驻在岱崮周围。
    当英雄们坚持到二十多天后，给养发生困难，没有米粮，就采集野草吃，没有柴火烧，就喝冷水，天下雨，崮上整天不退雾，衣裳拧拧水就算干了。在连阴天，山水灌入洞里，有的达一人深，大家就在水面安上木板当床铺，轮流舀水，轮流睡觉。这样整整过了一礼拜。在这样艰苦的日子里，领导同志就找人讲述红军长征故事，模范党员陈善坚持徂徕山区的斗争故事和过去反“扫荡”故事等，大大地鼓舞了全体坚持到底的意志，伤病员在吃盐水泡冷饭时也都很满意的说：“比起陈善同志在徂徕山用罐子吊在脖子上爬下山去找水喝，四五天不见粮食要好多了。”
    为了更好的坚持山崮，打垮敌人的围困，胡营长率领着二十多个特别健壮的勇士冲下山，用游击战配合守崮部队。粉碎了敌人的碉堡围困，接连打垮了站岩，章子崮等四、五处蒋记“还乡团”，又和周围坚持斗争的地方干部一块打开了三个区的局面，并接济了崮上的给养。胡营长本是二等残废，但他始终吃苦在前，以模范行动鼓励大家。他和大家一样背粮送上山去，他说多背一点，崮上就多吃一天，在宿营时他总是先叫大家休息，自己站岗。这样一直坚持到第四十二天，终于逼令敌人垂头丧气地撤走了。
    为了表扬英雄们的光辉功绩与坚毅不拔的精神，鲁中军区已授予该营长以“岱崮英雄”，授予该连以“岱崮连”的光荣称号。（新华社华东七日电）
