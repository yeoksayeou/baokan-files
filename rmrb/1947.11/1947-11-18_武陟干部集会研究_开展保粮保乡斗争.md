　　Wuzhi Cadre Meeting Studies and Deploys
    Struggle to Protect Grain and Homeland
    [This newspaper's Wuzhi dispatch] On the 7th of this month, the secretaries of each sub-committee, district heads, and main cadres of each organization convened to discuss preparations for war and to deploy the struggle to protect the fields, grain, and homeland. Everyone unanimously believed that this year's situation is very different from last year. This year, under our large-scale counter-offensive, the enemy is only seizing grain and conscripting soldiers locally. In the past, the war preparations were poor, mainly due to ideological underestimation and negligence. For example, when the enemy went to Qin South to seize grain this time, the cadres and masses underestimated the enemy ideologically and were unprepared, resulting in a great loss. After everyone's self-criticism, the following decisions were made: 1. Break the cadres' idea of going up the mountains to retreat and escape, stand with the masses, share weal and woe, hold the ground, stick to the village, the district, and the county, and launch a struggle to protect grain, soldiers, and the homeland. 2. Establish command posts at all levels, improve their organization, clarify the division of labor, and especially strengthen the organization and leadership of the joint defense command post. 3. Strictly examine the militia, purge the bad militia, place good weapons in the hands of the liberated militia, and carry out a more powerful struggle. 4. Strengthen intelligence and eliminate traitors, understand and grasp the enemy's situation at any time, and prevent panic. Strengthen the work of the public security team, control landlords and despots, make everyone responsible, and turn it into a mass-based control and elimination of traitors. 5. Transfer and disperse grain and store it in villages with a relatively solid foundation for work, and hold oaths for the storage team. 6. Transform the terrain and dig trenches to facilitate combat and mass transfer. 7. Launch political offensives to break the masses' underestimation and negligence; cadres, militia family members, elderly and weak masses organize special personnel to be responsible for the transfer to reduce the concerns of cadres and militia; livestock organize transfer teams with special personnel to be responsible for preserving draught animals.
