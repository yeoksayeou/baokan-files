    An'yang Village Plows Twice
    [Report from PingShun by Our Newspaper] After half a month of intensive work, An'yang Village in the Seventh District had completely plowed the first time of 1,520 mu of autumn land by the 22nd. That night, a plowing expert meeting was held, seizing the moment and not relaxing. A plan for plowing a second time was immediately drawn up: with 37 head of livestock, each head would plow an average of 2.5 mu per day. Starting on the 24th, all 1,520 mu of sloping autumn land would be completely plowed within 12 days, by November 5th. On October 13th, an inspection team was organized to conduct a general inspection of the first plowing. After summarizing, commending, and mobilizing for autumn fertilizer application, everyone was in high spirits. Poor peasant Li Renhu's team organized four male full laborers to deliver 36 loads of fertilizer to nearby fields in one night. According to incomplete statistics from the whole village, more than 30 mu of land have already been plowed for the second time, and the application of autumn fertilizer and the second plowing are now in a tense and enthusiastic phase.
