[Report from this newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu office on the 27th] The Fucheng 7th District of the 5th Military Sub-district has gained experience in maintaining the area under the conditions of seesaw warfare. Since the beginning of the counter-offensive, the district has experienced four enemy crossings without suffering major losses, has promptly cracked down on landlord-special agent activities, protected the interests of the masses, and war support work has not been greatly affected. The experience is summarized as follows: (1) Getting close to enemy activities: In several enemy crossings, those comrades who were close to the enemy, monitoring the enemy, seeing the enemy with their own eyes, understanding the situation, and boldly relying on the masses and favorable terrain were very bold, jumping over walls and escaping when the enemy came. Cadres who did not understand the situation became panicked, fearful, pessimistic and disappointed upon hearing rumors, ultimately scaring themselves. (2) Selecting capable armed forces to monitor the enemy, understand the enemy's situation and actions, quickly and promptly strike the enemy, and capture enemy stragglers, so that the enemy does not dare to disperse. (3) Mastering surrounding intelligence, actively contacting neighboring villages, establishing various intelligence networks, understanding the enemy's strength, avoiding being misled by rumors, and preventing emotional disorder and passivity; (4) Investigating the source of rumors and suppressing them in a focused and timely manner, using various forces and methods to control landlords and bad elements, so that the enemy loses its eyes and ears, reducing our concerns during persistence; (5) Wartime preparation work is well combined with situation propaganda. The masses understand the situation and are not afraid when the enemy's large army crosses the border, do not have thoughts of things changing, and promptly empty their homes and bury their belongings, so the masses do not suffer major losses and maintain stable morale.

    接敌活动了解情况
    复程七区坚持阵地经验
    【本报冀鲁豫二十七日电】五分区复程七区，在拉锯形势中获得坚持地区的经验。该区自反攻开始以来，经过敌人四次过境，都没受到大的损失，并及时打击了地主特务活动，保卫了群众利益，战勤工作上没受到大的影响。今总结经验如下：（一）靠近敌人活动；敌人几次过境，凡是靠近敌人监视敌人的同志，亲眼看到敌人，了解情况并大胆依靠群众和有利地形的，都很大胆，敌人来了跳园逃跑。不了解情况的干部，听到了谣言就惊慌害怕、悲观失望，结果是自己吓唬了自己了。（二）选拔精干武装，监视敌人，了解敌人情况和行动，迅速及时打击敌人，捉敌掉队人员，使敌人不敢分散，（三）掌握周围情报，主动与邻村联系，建立各种情报，了解敌人力量大小，避免被谣言迷惑，影响情绪紊乱和被动；（四）发现谣言追究来源，有重点的及时镇压，用各种力量和办法控制地主坏蛋，使敌人失去眼目，减少我坚持中之顾虑；（五）备战工作与形势宣传结合的好，群众明白了形势，敌人大军过境时不害怕，没变天思想，及时空室清野埋藏东西，群众不受大损失保持稳定情绪。
