Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 14th: The Northeast Daily here published an editorial on the streamlining movement launched by direct organs and provincial and municipal-level organs in Harbin and other places in the rear, stating: The recent streamlining of organs directly under the Northeast Bureau and at the provincial and municipal levels aims to tighten organization, unify staffing, improve systems, increase work efficiency, establish a style of hard work and simplicity, and oppose corruption and waste, so that the use of all our human, material, and financial resources, and all aspects of our thinking, work, and life, can adapt to the requirements of large-scale warfare. However, today, the organization, work, and life of rear organs in various places, especially those located in large cities such as Harbin, still lag far behind the needs of the war. Currently, there are three main contradictions in the rear organs that urgently need to be overcome: (1) The contradiction between large-scale warfare and peaceful work and life in the rear. Some cadres are indifferent to the heroic battles of the soldiers at the front and turn a blind eye to the suffering of the people, but they are meticulous about their personal demands and enjoyment. Organizational life is lax, work is perfunctory, and some even have little interest in political study. A few individuals, infatuated with the dazzling lights of the city, have fallen into corruption and cannot extricate themselves. Some organs have overlapping structures, emphasizing form over substance, regardless of whether the work exists or not. (2) The contradiction between urban life and rural habits. The living conditions in Northeast cities are very different from those in the rural areas of liberated areas inside the passes. However, we retain the decentralization of rural life while being infected by urban extravagance, wasting a lot of manpower and resources. For example, today, food, clothing, and housing are much more convenient than in the past, but various organs still maintain a large number of service personnel. Today, there are convenient transportation facilities such as trains and trams, but the number of messengers has not decreased. Today, bandits in the rear are basically eliminated, and public security is consolidated, but there are still many guards. Each organ has its own set of rules, each person has their own way of doing things, resulting in extravagance, laxity, waste, and other consequences. Everyone must deeply recognize that if we do not have a high degree of dedication to serving the people and winning the war from rural to urban areas, and if we do not resolutely overcome the phenomena of extravagance, waste, corruption, and degeneration that are easily caused in cities, then the cause of the people's liberation will be in danger of failure. (3) The contradiction between the need for unity and concentration in warfare and the current state of decentralization and disarray. Today is an environment of large-scale warfare, which requires unity and concentration in all aspects of leadership in order to meet the needs of the situation and exert greater effectiveness. However, today, some rear organs are decentralized and disorganized, each with its own style and staffing, emphasizing local interests and disregarding the overall situation, making it impossible to unify command and dispatch, and the Party's decisions cannot be implemented. There are three disparities in living standards: between the front and the rear, between organs, and between superiors and subordinates. These disparities violate the requirements of the war, and we must establish the idea of the front being the top priority in everyone's mind. The above three contradictions must be thoroughly resolved in the streamlining process.

In addition, it should be recognized that today's streamlining is different from the streamlining and simplification of administration during the Anti-Japanese War. At that time, in order to persist in a long and brutal war and adapt to a decentralized guerrilla environment, we required our troops and organs to be small and efficient. Today, the people's strength is unprecedentedly strong, and the situation between the enemy and us has fundamentally changed. The significance of streamlining lies in clenching our fists and making our strength even stronger and more elite in order to completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.

### 克服浮奢腐化现象　建立艰苦朴实作风  东北日报论整编运动

　　克服浮奢腐化现象
  　建立艰苦朴实作风
    东北日报论整编运动
    【新华社东北十四日电】此间东北日报为哈市及各地后方机关开展整编运动，发表社论称：最近东北局决定的直属机关及省市一级的机关整编，目的在于严密组织，统一编制，健全制度，提高工作效率，建立艰苦朴实作风，反对贪污浪费，使我们一切人力、物力、财力的使用，一切思想、工作、生活等作风，都能适应大规模战争的要求，但今天各地后方机关特别是住在哈尔滨等大城市的机关，组织、工作与生活还远落后于战争的需要。目前后方机关有三个主要矛盾，急待大力克服：（一）大规模战争与后方和平工作生活的矛盾。部分干部对前线战士英勇搏战漠不关心，对人民的痛苦熟视无睹，但对个人的要求享受则必斤斤计较，组织生活松懈，工作敷衍塞责，甚至对政治学习极少兴趣，少数分子因迷恋于城市的花花绿绿，竟堕落到贪污腐化而不能自拔。有些机关机构重叠，只重形式，不论工作有无。（二）城市生活与乡村习惯的矛盾。东北城市生活条件与关内解放区农村生活条件有极大不同；但我们既停留于农村生活的分散性，却染着城市的浮奢，浪费不少人力物力，如：今天衣食住比过去方便得多，但各机关仍保有数量众多的勤杂人员，今天有火车、电车等交通便利条件，但通讯员并未减少；今天后方匪众基本肃清，治安巩固，但警卫员仍很多。各机关一套，各人一套，浮华散漫，铺张浪费，随之而起。大家必须深刻认识：由农村到城市如不具备高度的为人民服务，为战争胜利的观点，如不坚决克服在城市中容易引起的浮奢浪费贪污腐化的现象，那人民解放事业就有失败危险。（三）战争要求统一集中与今天分散零乱的矛盾。今天是大规模的战争环境，要求领导上各方面统一集中，才能满足情势需要，发挥更大效能，但今天后方有些机关则是分散零乱，各有各的作风，各有各的编制，强调本位，不顾大局，指挥调度，无法统一，党的决定，不能贯澈。在生活标准上则存在着三种悬殊：前方与后方，机关与机关，上级与下级，这种悬殊是违背战争要求的，必须在人人之中确立前方第一的思想。上面三种矛盾，必须在整编中求得彻底解决。
    此外应当认识，今天的整编与抗日战争时期的精兵简政不同，当时为了坚持长期残酷战争及适合分散游击环境，要求我们部队机关少而精，今天人民力量空前壮大，敌我形势基本改变，整编的意义则在捏紧拳头，使力量更加壮大与精锐，以彻底消灭蒋介石匪帮。
