Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. Comprehensive reports indicate that under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the lives of people in the Chiang-controlled areas are becoming increasingly difficult. On the streets of Shenyang, it is common to see children as young as seven or eight kowtowing to passersby to beg for food. Many children from poor families gather at train stations to collect coal cinders, and some even join coal theft gangs to make a living. Robberies occur frequently in the city, and most are committed by "yellow uniforms" (referring to Chiang Kai-shek's bandit soldiers). Women, driven by poverty, even make a profession out of getting married. The owner of a restaurant said that one woman had been married five times in his restaurant. In Zhangjiakou, under the rule of the bandit Fu, most factories have not resumed operation, and a large number of workers are unemployed. Some beg for a living, and some wives are forced into prostitution. "Behind the vermillion gates, meat and wine go to waste, while on the roads, there are bones of those who have starved to death." The most obvious manifestation of this is in Kaifeng. During the day, although there is a bustling scene of traffic and an air of prosperity, after nightfall, under the eaves of Western-style buildings, small children and women huddle together, scantily clad, shivering in the autumn wind, in a very miserable state. The "Zhongzhou Evening News" on September 23 published an advertisement for selling a daughter to survive: "I, Jiang Zhusun, originally from Beiping, work in the cultural field. I have a seven-year-old daughter. Now, forced by life, I am willing to sell her for 300,000 yuan in legal tender to serve under your knees," and so on. In Guangzhou, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang imposes heavy exactions, with each middle-class family bearing a burden of 200,000 to 300,000 yuan per month. Moreover, prices are soaring, and the people's livelihood is becoming increasingly difficult. According to statistics released by the Chiang Kai-shek health bureau, a total of 2,417 corpses were collected from the streets from January to August. The coal shortage in the city is very serious, and the use of elevators in shops and hotels is restricted.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. Qingdao, shaken by the People's Liberation Army's nationwide counter-offensive and the Jiahe Victory, is in a state of chaos. People are mocking and saying, "Chiang Kai-shek flies around everywhere after losing battles." Landlords and bullies who are fleeing feel that there is nowhere to hide. Prices are soaring continuously. During the price surge in October, prices rose by 100 percent. Coal is not available in the market, and power plants have experienced blackouts. The Chiang Kai-shek's official newspaper, the Qingdao Public Report, admitted that "the reason for the rise and fall of prices is entirely due to the instability of the people's hearts and the lack of trust in the legal tender by the citizens." The Chiang Kai-shek mayor, Li Xianliang, hastily convened a so-called "emergency meeting," but was still at a loss.

　　蒋匪统治就是罪恶
  　开封报载卖女求生启事
    广州半年收路尸二千余
    【新华社陕北十日电】综合各方报导：在蒋家匪帮统治下，蒋区人民生活日益困苦。沈阳街头常见七、八岁幼童以向行人磕头讨乞，很多清寒家庭儿童，群集车站上检煤渣，并有参加偷煤帮以谋生者，市内抢案不断发生，且多系“黄衣人”（指蒋匪军）所为。妇女为生活所迫竟有以结婚为职业者，某饭店老板谈：一女郎先后五次在该饭店结婚。张家口在傅匪统治下，工厂多未开工，大批工人失业，有的讨饭为生，有的老婆被迫为妓。“朱门酒肉臭，路有饿死骨”表现得最明显的是开封，白天纵然车水马龙，气象升平，但夜深人静后，洋楼檐下，蜷伏着一窝一窝的小孩妇女，衣不蔽体，秋风中抖索，状至凄惨。九月二十三日的“中州晚报”登载着一则卖女求生的启事：“鄙人蒋竹荪，原籍北平，任职文化界。有女七岁，今为生活所迫，愿以三十万元法币，卖于滕下承欢”等语。广州蒋家匪帮勒索苛重，每一中等人家每月负担即达二、三十万元，且物价剧涨，民生日趋艰难，据蒋匪卫生局发表统计：一月至八月共收殓路尸达二千四百十七具之多。市内煤荒甚为严重，商店旅馆使用电梯均受限制。
    【新华社陕北十日电】在人民解放军全国大反攻及胶河大捷震撼下之青岛，已呈一片混乱。人民纷纷嘲笑说：“蒋秃子吃了败仗就到处乱飞”，逃亡地主恶霸均感无处躲藏。物价接连暴涨，十月涨风期间，物价骤涨百分之一百，煤则无市，电厂一度停电。蒋匪机关报青岛公报供认“物价跌涨原因，完全由于人心不安定，市民对法币无信任所致”，蒋匪市长李先良慌忙召开所谓“紧急会议”，但仍束手无策。
