　　The Seventh District of Yuanchao is Conducting a Thorough Investigation After Discovering That Three Poor Peasant Households in Huazhuang Still Had Not Planted a Single Furrow of Wheat.
    [Report from This Newspaper] The Seventh District of Yuanchao is conducting an in-depth investigation into the wheat planting situation of poor peasants. This was initiated after discovering that three poor peasant households in Huazhuang village still had not planted a single furrow of wheat. Huazhuang has a total of 166 households, and 20 of them do not have livestock. While the village cadres put in effort, registering households and organizing specifically, there were still three poor peasant households that did not plant wheat. Huang Shuwang planned to plant six mu of wheat, but the group said he was lazy and did not want him to participate in mutual aid, so he did not plant any. The widow Huang Lushi planned to plant four mu, but because she was superstitious, the masses were unwilling to work with her, so she also did not plant any wheat. The village cadres reported to the district several times, always saying, "All the households in our village without livestock have planted." Later, the three households took the initiative to find the district cadres and explained the situation, and the district cadres helped persuade the masses to help them plant. To ensure that poor peasants can harvest wheat next year and not go hungry, all villages in the district are conducting thorough investigations, proposing: Oppose subjectivism, oppose simply listening to village cadres and considering the matter finished, otherwise the poor peasants will suffer greatly.

　　化庄三户贫民没种一垅麦子
  　惊动元朝七区普遍深入检查
    【本报讯】元朝七区正深入检查贫民种麦情况，这是在发现该区化庄三户贫民仍未种上一垅麦子后进行的。化庄共百六十六户，二十户没牲口，种麦中村干虽曾卖了力气，作了按户登记和具体组织，但仍有三户贫民未有种上麦，其中黄书忘准备种六亩麦子，组里说他懒，都不愿叫他参加互助，所以没有种上。孤寡黄路氏准备种四亩麦，因她迷信，群众也不愿和她一起，故也没种上麦子。村干几次向区汇报，都说：“俺村没牲口户都种上了。”后经该三户主动找到区干，说明情由，区干才帮助说通群众，给他们种上。为保证贫民明年能接上麦，不挨饿，全区各村正作深入检查。提出：反对主观主义，反对听村干一谈就完事，不然贫民要吃大亏。（十一日四日冀南日报）
