　　Gao Yi Mothers Send Sons, Wives Send Husbands
　　Young and Strong Men Vie to Join the Battlefield

　　[Report from our Gao Yi correspondent] At the celebration meeting for the great counter-offensive in Chengguan, after discussing the situation of the great counter-offensive, the masses compared Gao Yi this year with Gao Yi last year. Wang Loru, a military dependent from Xiguan, said: "At this time last year, we were preparing for war, digging tunnels, and moving grain to the west, preparing for the enemy's arrival. The enemy also spread rumors every day, saying: We will come to Gao Yi today! We will open the Pinghan Line tomorrow! It made it so we couldn't sleep a peaceful night. The situation is different now. We have tightly surrounded Yuanshi City." After comparing the situation in this county, everyone recognized the current situation, reviewed the historical pain, traced the backers of the landlords, and traced them back to Chiang Kai-shek. Finally, Xiao Mo said: "I used to think that suffering was caused by the landlords, but now I realize that the root of suffering is Chiang Kai-shek, the bastard." In the process of pouring out grievances and tracing the roots, everyone compared the past suffering life with the current liberated times. Kong Chuanghu, the village chief of Sunjiazhuang Village, encouraged by the victorious situation, proposed: "Others fought the war of resistance for eight or nine years and liberated me, helping me to turn over. I must resolutely participate in the counter-offensive army to liberate the poor brothers who are still suffering under the oppression of Chiang Kai-shek and his feudal landlords." Wang Shu from Wubai Village said: "Now is the right time to join the army. Chiang Kai-shek is about to be finished." Guo Xiqing, a woman from Sunjiazhuang Village, proposed to send her husband and her nephew to capture Chiang Kai-shek together. Wang Loru said: "I sent my eldest son to join the army last year, and this year I want to send my second son." She was afraid that her second son was too young to pass the examination accurately, and proposed that it should be based on height, not age. Moving stories of fathers sending sons, wives sending husbands, and mothers sending sons can be heard everywhere. During the afternoon general discussion, the slogan "If you want to eat thick porridge, put the colander in yourself" became popular in every corner. Young people from each gate and village flocked to the rostrum, "I report the first name?" "I report the second name!" "I report the third name!"... The sound of registration shook the entire venue. Twenty-six young people from Sunjiazhuang Village swarmed up, vying to sign up to capture the Chiang bandit. Within fifteen minutes, one hundred and thirteen young and strong men signed up to capture Chiang Kai-shek.

　　高邑母送子，妻送郎
  　青壮争先上战场
    【本报高邑讯】城关庆祝大反攻会上，群众讨论了大反攻形势后，再拿今年的高邑与去年的高邑作了对比。西关军属王洛儒说：“去年现在正备战，打地道，粮食都拉到西边，准备敌人来，敌人也每天造谣说：今日来高邑呀！明日打通平汉线呀！弄的咱不能睡一夜安生觉，现在情形不同了，咱们紧紧包围住了元氏城。”在比了本县的局面后，大家认识了现在的形势，又回顾了历史痛苦，追出了地主的后台，追到了蒋介石身上，最后小谟说：“我以前只认为苦是地主给的，现在才认识到苦根是蒋介石王八蛋。”在诉苦追根中，大家又拿了过去的受罪生活与现在的翻身时光作了对比。孙家庄村长孔窗户，在胜利形势鼓舞下，提出：“别人抗战八九年解放了我，帮助我翻了身，我要坚决参加反攻军，去解放现在仍受蒋介石及其封建地主压迫下的穷苦兄弟。”五百村王淑说：“现在参军正是时候，蒋介石快完蛋了。”孙家庄妇女郭喜庆提出，要送自己丈夫自己侄儿一块去捉蒋介石。王洛儒说：“我去年送大儿参了军，今年我要送我二儿子去。”她怕她二儿子年纪小验不准，提出要按个子，不能按岁数。父送子、妻送郎、母送儿的动人故事，到处可以听见。下午大会讨论中，各个角落流行开了：“要想吃稠的，亲自下笊篱”的口号，各关各村的青年涌到主席台前，“我报第一名？”“我报第二名！”“我报第三名！”……报名声震动了全会场，孙家庄二十六个青年一涌而上，争先恐后报名捉蒋贼。十五分钟内报名捉蒋介石的青壮年，即有一百一十三名。（文彦、张英、淑贞、孔秋、乔林）
