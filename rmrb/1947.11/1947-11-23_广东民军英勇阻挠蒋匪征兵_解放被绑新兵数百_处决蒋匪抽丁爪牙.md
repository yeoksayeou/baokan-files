Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 21st Telegram: According to a Shanghai Dagongbao Guangzhou October 19th special dispatch, citing Chiang bandit "military control area" news: the activity of the Guangdong people's armed forces has caused Chiang bandit conscription to suffer major difficulties. The Guangdong Chiang bandit's conscription date for this year has exceeded the deadline by two months, but it is still impossible to meet the quota. Hundreds of recruits kidnapped by Chiang bandits in southern and northern Guangdong were liberated by the people's armed forces; many henchmen of Chiang bandits conscripting in northern and southern Guangdong were also executed by the people's armed forces. The Guangdong Chiang bandit authorities are extremely panicked by the powerful development of the people's armed forces and have announced the early implementation of "winter defense" on November 1st. In addition, according to an Associated Press Guangzhou dispatch on the 15th of this month: due to the increasingly fierce activities of the people's armed forces, Chiang bandits have been forced to implement "armed escort" for ships sailing from Guangzhou to Shiqi, sixty miles south of the city.

    【新华社陕北二十一日电】据沪大公报广州十月十九日专电：引蒋匪“军管区”消息透露：广东人民武装的活跃，已使蒋匪抽丁遭受重大困难。广东蒋匪本年度征兵日期已逾限两月，但仍无法足额。蒋匪在粤南、粤北各地绑来的新兵数百人，被人民武装解放；蒋匪在粤北及粤南抽丁的爪牙亦有多名被人民武装处决。广东蒋匪当局对人民武装强大发展恐慌异常，已宣布提前于十一月一日实施“冬防”。另据美联社广州本月十五日电透露：由于人民武装活动益趋剧烈，已迫使蒋匪对由广州驶向该地以南六十英里的石岐之轮船实行“武装护航”。
