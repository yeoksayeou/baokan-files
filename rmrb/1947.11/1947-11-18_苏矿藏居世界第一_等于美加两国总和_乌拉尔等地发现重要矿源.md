Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th. Moscow Dispatch: Thirty years of diligent surveying by Soviet geologists have revealed that the Soviet Union is the richest country in the world in terms of resources. Its known mineral deposits are equal to the total of the United States and Canada. Of the ninety-two elements listed in Mendeleev's periodic table of chemical elements, the Soviet Union possesses eighty, and is the only country in the world self-sufficient in non-metallic mineral production. To find raw materials, Soviet geologists have ventured across the vast wildernesses of the Soviet Union to carry out surveys. As a result, coal mines with reserves far exceeding those of the Donets Basin were discovered in the Kuznetsk Basin, and large amounts of coal mines were discovered in the Pechora and Karaganda regions, making the Soviet Union's coal reserves surpass those of European countries and rank second in the world. Oil reserves were discovered in the Ural-Volga region, far exceeding the "Second Baku" in the Apsheron Peninsula, where Baku is located. By the time of the 17th International Geological Congress in 1937, the Soviet Union's known oil reserves had increased seventeen times compared to before the revolution. Iron ore discovered in the Urals, Siberia, Transcaucasia, and Kazakhstan has increased the base of the Soviet Union's steel industry dozens of times. This year, the Soviet Union's expenditure on geological surveys has increased more than a thousand times compared to the highest amount in old Russia, the number of personnel has increased more than a hundred times, and the surveyed area has reached 900,000 square kilometers. Directly led by the government's Geological Department, Soviet geology is the most advanced in the world.

　　苏矿藏居世界第一
    等于美加两国总和
  　乌拉尔等地发现重要矿源
    【新华社陕北十四日电】莫斯科讯：苏联地质学家三十年来辛勤勘测之结果，已发现苏联为世界资源最富之国家，其已知之矿藏，等于美国与加拿大两国之总和。孟德雷叶夫化学元素周期表上所列九十二种元素中，苏联拥有八十种，而为世界上唯一非金属矿产能自给自足之国家。苏联地质学家为寻求原料，曾冒险遍历苏联广漠之荒山僻野，从事勘测，结果在库兹涅茨克盆地发现储藏量远超过顿尼兹盆地之煤矿，并在配丘拉、喀拉干达诸地区发现大量煤矿，使苏联之煤藏量超越欧洲各国而居世界第二。在乌拉尔瓦尔加区发现石油储藏量，远超过巴库所在地阿普什农半岛之“第二巴库”。迄一九三七年第十七次国际地质学大会时，苏联已知油藏量已较革命前增加十七倍。在乌拉尔、西伯利亚、外高加索、哥萨克斯坦各地发现之铁矿，使苏联纲铁工业之基地增加数十倍。苏联今年用于地质勘测之经费较旧俄最高额增加千倍以上，人员增加百倍以上，勘测地区达九十万方公里，由政府地质部直接领导，苏联地质学乃世界各国最先进者。
