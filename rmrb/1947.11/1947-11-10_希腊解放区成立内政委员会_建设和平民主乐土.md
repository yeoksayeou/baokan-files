Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: Athens Dispatch: The Greek liberated areas are becoming increasingly consolidated and are actively engaged in various construction projects. The headquarters of the Greek Democratic Army issued a notice on the 2nd to establish an Internal Affairs Committee, responsible for managing the free territories that "do not yield to the Athens fascist government," and to organize the "Greek Free Territory People's Guard" to ensure order, peace, security, and the property of the people in the liberated areas. The headquarters also promulgated an order to restore education in the liberated areas. The People's Committee is responsible for repairing all school buildings and confiscating the houses, materials, and cash of fleeing landlords and big merchants to be used as school buildings and educational funds. In view of the fact that farmers in the liberated areas have been cruelly devastated by arson and looting by fascist bandit troops, affecting this year's harvest, the headquarters decided that all farmers' debts to the Agricultural Bank will be postponed for three years. A few days ago, the liberated areas also held elections for the "People's Command," and the people actively participated in the voting.

    希腊解放区成立内政委员会
    建设和平民主乐土
    【新华社陕北六日电】雅典讯：希腊解放区日趋巩固，并积极从事各种建设。希民主军总部于二日通令成立内政委员会，负责管理“不屈服于雅典法西斯政府”的自由领土；并组织“希腊自由领土人民警卫队”，保障解放区秩序、和平、安全及人民的财产。总部同时颁布恢复解放区教育的命令。由人民委员会负责修葺一切学校建筑，并没收逃亡大地主大商人的房屋、物资与现金，充作校舍与教育经费之用。总部鉴于解放区农民因遭法西斯匪军纵火抢掠等残酷摧残，影响今年之收成，故决定所有农民对农业银行之欠款，一律延期三年偿还。日前，解放区并进行“人民指挥部”的选举，人民均积极参加投票。
