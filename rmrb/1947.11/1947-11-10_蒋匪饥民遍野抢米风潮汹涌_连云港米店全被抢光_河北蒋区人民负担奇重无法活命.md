Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 7th: In Lianyungang and Xinpu, the eastern end of the Longhai Railway in the Chiang Kai-shek occupied area, a wave of grain-robbing is surging among famine victims. These two areas were originally grain-producing regions, but due to the insatiable plunder and external transportation by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, they are now experiencing a severe grain shortage. In mid-October, flour in Xinpu rose to 6,500 Chiang currency per pound, and rice prices in Lianyungang also soared. Impoverished people, unable to survive, rose up to rob grain and prevent its transportation out of the area. On the 13th, a certain unscrupulous merchant in Lianyungang, connected with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, transported 400 bags of wheat, totaling 80,000 pounds, for export. More than 400 impoverished people swarmed to rob it. Then, on the 15th, a grain-robbing storm swept across Xinpu. At 7:00 AM, several trucks loaded with miscellaneous grains were waiting at Xinpu Station to be transported to Lianyungang for shipment. More than 200 impoverished people gathered, holding up sickles to block the transportation at the station. Along the way, more and more impoverished people gathered, forming a surging crowd. At 12:00 noon, another group of over 400 impoverished people intercepted 150 bags of flour being transported to Lianyungang on the Guanyun section of Tongyu Road. Chiang Kai-shek bandit police rushed to suppress them, but the flour had already been looted. At 1:00 PM, another group of impoverished people intercepted a truck loaded with soybeans and wheat on Zhongda Street. At the same time, the masses intercepted a truck loaded with sacks on Zhongzheng South Road, using knives to cut open the sacks, revealing flour. The crowd was in an uproar and planned to rush to Yu Ji Grain Store, an unscrupulous merchant who was privately transporting the flour, to seize its stockpiled thousands of piculs of wheat. The grain store agreed to sell the stored grain at a fair price, and thus narrowly escaped. On that day, the grain reserves of major grain shops were all looted. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities, intimidated by the power of the masses, ordered that wheat exports should not exceed 120 pounds and flour exports should not exceed 90 pounds, and agreed to the masses' demand to release six impoverished people who had been sentenced to death for resisting grain levies.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: The people in the Chiang Kai-shek occupied area of Hebei Province bear extremely heavy burdens and suffer unspeakable hardship. According to an editorial in the Tianjin Dagong Daily on the 17th of last month, the suffering that Chiang Kai-shek bandits "inflict on the people of the north today is even more profound than during the enemy puppet's harsh rule. The burden alone has reached the point of bone-scraping and marrow-extraction, making it impossible to live." In the Pingjin-Baoding triangle area, just taking three burdens as examples, the numbers are already staggering. First, Hebei currently has a total of thirteen security corps regiments. The Chiang Kai-shek government only provides a very small amount of funding. The food cost difference alone for these units is 36 billion yuan per year, and two seasons of clothing cost 9 billion yuan. However, Hebei Province's entire annual budget is only 30 billion yuan. The huge deficit is entirely borne by the people. Second, Chiang Kai-shek bandits build civil war defense works every day. The fortifications in Baoding alone cost more than 10 billion, and Changping County spent 6.5 billion. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit "national treasury" never allocates funds for this expenditure. For the Chiang Kai-shek bandits to build railway lines for the civil war, they requisition materials locally, and the official prices issued are often only one-third or one-fifth of the market price. The people's burden often amounts to tens of billions or even hundreds of billions of yuan. Third, the official price issued for the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army's non-staple food, horse feed, and military expenses is only 80,000 yuan, while the market price is 650,000 yuan, with the price paid being less than one-eighth, which is tantamount to open robbery. Therefore, farmers work hard all year round, and even lose a large amount of capital for seeds and fertilizers. This year, the harvest per mu, including miscellaneous grains, is at most only 100 jin, and the assigned levy per mu reaches 80 to 100 jin. Farmers have to provide 80% or even all of their income to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits for exploitation. The suffering of their lives can be imagined.

    蒋匪饥民遍野抢米风潮汹涌
    连云港米店全被抢光
    河北蒋区人民负担奇重无法活命
    【新华社华中七日电】蒋区陇海东端连云港及新浦饥民抢米风潮高涨。该二地原为产粮区，经蒋匪无餍搜刮及外运，致呈严重粮荒。上月中旬新浦面粉涨至每斤蒋币六千五百元，连云港亦米价高涨，贫民无法活命乃奋起抢粮并制止粮食外运。十三日连云港与蒋匪有关之某奸商运小麦四百包共八万斤出口，被贫民四百余人蜂拥抢夺。接着于十五日新浦抢粮的风暴遍及全市，晨七时，新浦车站数辆汽车满载杂粮，待运连云港装船，贫民集结二百余人，高举镰刀至车站禁运，沿途贫民愈集愈多，汇成汹涌人流。正午十二时另一路贫民四百余在通榆路灌云段拦住正运往连云港的面粉一百五十包，蒋匪警察赶到镇压，面粉已被抢光。下午一时另部贫民又在中大街截获满载黄豆小麦之汽车，同时群众并于中正南路拦住满载麻袋之汽车一辆，用刀割破麻袋，露出面粉，群情大哗，拟奔赴私运该批面粉之奸商玉记粮行抢分其囤积之数千石小麦，该粮行允将存粮平价出售，始得幸免。是日各大粮店存粮均被抢光。蒋匪当局慑于群众威力，乃下令小麦出口不得过百二十斤，面粉不得过九十斤，并允群众要求将前因抗粮被判死刑的贫民六人释放。
    【新华社陕北八日电】河北省蒋区人民负担奇重，苦不堪言。据上月十七日天津大公报社论中称：蒋匪“今日给予北方人民之苦难，较敌伪苛政时期尤为深刻，负担一项，即已达到敲骨剥髓万万不能生活的地步。”在平津保三角地带，仅举三项负担为例，数目已属惊人。第一河北现有保安总队共十三个团，蒋政府仅供极少费用，团队在食费差价一项每年即亏三百六十亿元，一年两季服装已亏九十亿元，而河北省全年预算却不过三百亿元，其中庞大之不敷数字，全由人民负担。第二蒋匪每天修内战防御工事，仅保定工事即耗去一百多亿，昌平一县费去六十五亿。此项费用蒋匪“国库”从不拨款。蒋匪为修筑内战交通线铁路，均为就地征用材料，所发官价往往不及市价三分之一或五分之一，人民负担，动辄数十亿甚至百亿元。第三蒋匪军副食马乾军费，所发官价仅为八万元，而市价须六十五万元，而市价须六十五万元，给价不及八分之一，无异公开抢劫。因此农民终年辛劳，更赔垫出种籽肥料等大量本钱，今年每亩收获连杂粮在内至多不过一百斤，每亩摊派即达八十斤至一百斤，农民要以所得的百分之八十甚至全部供蒋匪剥削，生活之苦可以想见。
