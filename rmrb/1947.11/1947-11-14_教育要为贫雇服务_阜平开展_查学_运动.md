　　Education Should Serve the Poor and Hired Labor
  　Fuping Launches "School Inspection" Campaign
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 9th] Fuping County, Ji-Jin District, recently held a symposium of primary school teachers from the entire county to conduct a "school inspection" campaign. It was found that in the past, the primary education work in most villages followed the landlord and rich peasant line, forming a situation where "peasants provide rice, and landlords and rich peasants go to school." A large number of poor children were kept outside the school gates. In the past, the leadership only focused on running schools in wealthy villages and towns as decorations. When allocating teachers, the best teachers were often sent to wealthy large villages and towns, while inexperienced teachers were sent to poor villages in remote mountain areas. Some poor villages could not afford to hire teachers, and the leadership allowed the situation to drift. Empty slogans were shouted about organizing poor children to attend school, or forced enrollment, which resulted in many poor peasants being punished and scolded as backward. At the same time, a large number of teachers from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds were employed. These teachers themselves had not been reformed, so they only took care of the children of landlords and rich peasants and looked down on poor children. After the meeting, the Fuping County Party Committee specifically proposed establishing the idea that education should serve the poor and hired laborers, and pointed out that today, the task for schools is not to streamline, shut down, or postpone operations, but to greatly strengthen them, and to mobilize poor peasants and hired laborers to inspect schools and run schools.

　　教育要为贫雇服务
  　阜平开展“查学”运动
    【新华社晋察冀九日电】冀晋区阜平，日前召开全县小学教师座谈会，进行“查学”运动。查出过去大部村庄小学教育工作，走了地主富农路线，形成“农民出米，地主富农上学”。广大贫苦儿童关在学校门外。由于过去领导上只以办好富裕村镇的学校作装饰，在分配教员时，往往最好的教员派至富裕的大村镇，山沟小道贫困村子，则派没经验的教员。某些贫苦村子请不起教员，领导上则任其自流。空喊组织贫苦儿童入学，或强迫入学，致使很多贫苦农民受到处罚，并被骂为落后。同时大量作用地主富农出身的教员，这些教员本身未经改造，因此只照顾地主富农子弟，对贫苦儿童则看不起。会后阜平县委特提出明确树立教育为贫雇服务的思想，并指出今天对学校不是精简停办或缓办，而是要大大加强，要发动贫雇农民起来查学校办学校。
