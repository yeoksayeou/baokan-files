Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀 [Jinchaji] 16th Dispatch: Our local armed forces in the Pingjinbao triangle area have persisted in on-the-spot struggles, engaging in 322 battles from January to the end of October, eliminating a total of 7,585 Chiang bandits. A certain army corps in the area coordinated with the 石 (庄) 东 [Shi (Zhuang) Dong] operation in April, firmly defended Shengfang, fought bravely for seven days and nights, and successfully completed the task of containing enemy forces. In July, in coordination with the Qingcang Campaign, they captured Yongqing County in one fell swoop. In early September, the battle south of the Daqing River shattered the enemy's attempt to invade southward. During the Pingbao Campaign in October, they continuously captured more than ten important villages and towns such as Niusuo, and forced the retreat of enemy strongholds along the Sanjiadian to Shuangputou line. The Daxing local armed forces won four battles out of four in August, and in October went deep into the Yongding River area to fight, completely eliminating the enemy's self-defense regiment in a certain district of the county. The Wanliang local armed forces fought four times in October, destroying four sections of railway, and in the past two months destroyed fifteen pseudo-Lianzhuang and large townships. The Rong (County) Ding (County) local armed forces, during the "mopping-up" operations in August and September, destroyed more than ten bunkers such as Liu Village, and forced the retreat of nearly one hundred Chiang bandit strongholds. On October 23rd, the Xincheng local armed forces penetrated deep into Liuzhuangzi, a core stronghold of the Wang bandit Fenggang, and captured Guo Zhongchun, the enemy's propaganda section chief, alive. In total, over the past ten months, they have captured more than 140 towns and cities such as Yongqing and Kaikou, and forced the retreat of more than 140 strongholds, seizing eight 60mm mortars and howitzers, 84 machine guns, more than 1,990 rifles and pistols, more than 150,000 rounds of various ammunition, and many other supplies.
