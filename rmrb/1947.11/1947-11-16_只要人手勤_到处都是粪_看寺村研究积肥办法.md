　　As long as people are diligent, manure is everywhere
  　A visit to Sicun Village to study methods of accumulating fertilizer

    [Changzhi Dispatch from this Newspaper] The Sicun Village in the Third District, having just won the red flag after the successful completion of the three major tasks of autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn storage, convened a meeting of mutual aid team leaders and technical committee members the next night (November 6th) to study methods of accumulating fertilizer. Wang Manyou said, "A sweeping broom makes a long manure pile. Sweeping the streets and accumulating fallen leaves into manure piles is a good way to accumulate fertilizer." Ma Huaishan said, "Sweeping the black ash from the house and repairing the kang (heated brick bed) can all accumulate fertilizer and also improve hygiene. Don't underestimate the small amount of ash; five or six rooms can provide enough for one mu of land, and it's good fertilizer." Qin Yuchang said, "Changing the soil types is like 'moving soil to change soil, moving stones for five [days].' That is to say: putting sandy soil on sticky soil, sticky soil on sandy soil, black soil on white soil, and white soil on black soil. This kind of soil improvement is equivalent to applying fertilizer once and can increase grain production." Ma Yinghao said, "Crushed Chinese toona seeds can also be used as fertilizer. Although there are few tree seeds, accumulating small amounts adds up. As the saying goes, 'As long as people are diligent, manure is everywhere!'" Jing Yuanhai said, "However, crushed pagoda tree seeds, after being composted, are a good fertilizer for the land!" Wang Sihao said, "Black mud from the hemp pond is also very good for the land." Wang Yuanhe said, "Tree leaves, dry bark, withered grass, and crop stalks are best for making smoked manure." Jing Xishi said, "Smoked manure must be combined with baked ash; otherwise, getting nitrate will be a problem. I have a good method, which is to build 'tiger caves.' Tiger caves are good for baking ash and smoking manure in three ways: First, the ash and fertilizer won't be blown away; second, they won't get wet in the rain; and third, they can smoke the fertilizer well. When building, the cave should be large, the soil clods should be well-shaped, the top should be well-made to prevent soil from falling down, and the bottom should be flat and solid. The opening should be plastered with mud for easy ash removal. After the cave is built, chop the crop stalks, wet them with water, and send them into the cave to smoke. The ash produced by this kind of smoking will yield more nitrate, and the fertilizer will also be well-smoked. It is absolutely forbidden to let the fire burn; if it burns, the smoked fertilizer will lose its strength. The number of smoking sessions should be once every other day for the first half of the month, and then once every two days for the second half of the month, to prevent the fire from scorching it." Everyone agreed with what he said, and they all said that this method was very good. Then they studied how to do it, and Xibao added, "Let's take the lead first. When the masses see what we are doing, they will also do it, and in this way, the masses will also start doing it." Subsequently, several groups said, "We will hold a mutual aid team meeting early tomorrow morning and definitely take the lead first to influence the whole village." As a result, ten groups completed fifteen caves in two days. (Ainong)

　　只要人手勤  到处都是粪
  　看寺村研究积肥办法
    【本报长治讯】三区看寺村在秋收秋耕秋屯三大工作胜利完成后，刚刚夺罢了红旗，第二天黑夜（十一月六号），召开了各互助组长、技术委员会议，研究积肥办法：王满有说：“扫帚响，粪堆长，扫街道，落叶积成粪堆，就是积肥的好办法。”马怀山说：“扫房里的黑灰，修理炕，都能积肥，又讲卫生，别看灰少，五、六间房就能上一亩地，可是好粪。”秦玉昌说：“土倒土，打石五。就是说：黏土地上沙土，沙土地上黏土，白土地上黑土，黑土地上白土，这样改造土壤，也顶上一次粪，能多打粮食。”马英豪说：“椿树籽碾碎也能顶粪，别看树籽少，积小成多，俗语说：只要人手勤，到处都是粪呀！”景元海说：“可是，槐树籽碾碎，沤好上地是好肥料呀！”王四好说：“麻池乌泥上地也很好。”王元和说：“树叶荒皮枯草、田禾杆子，这些东西最好是薰粪。”景喜实说：“薰粪必须与烘灰结合，不然熬硝就成问题，我有个好办法，就是垒老虎洞子，老虎洞子烘灰薰粪有三好：一、灰粪吹不跑；二、雨下不湿；三、还能薰好粪。垒时，洞子要大，土块整好，顶子弄好，别掉下土去了，底子要平，要坚，洞口用泥抹光，掏灰时好掏。把洞子垒好，田禾杆子铡碎，用水，使田禾杆子潮湿，送到洞子里薰，这样薰的灰多出硝，粪也薰的好，决不可叫火着起来，着起来就把薰好的粪烧没劲了，薰的次数，前半月每隔一天薰一次，掏一次灰，后半月每隔两天一次这也是怕火烘着了。”他这一说，得到了大家的同意，七言八语的，都说这办法很好，接着又研究怎样干，喜宝又说：“咱们先带头，群众看见咱们作甚，他们也就作甚，这样群众也就干起来了。”随后有好几个组都说：“咱们明天早晨开好互助组会，一定先起带头，影响全村。”结果有十个组，两天完成了十五个洞子。（爱农）
