Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 14th. Chiang and the U.S., in a joint operation through the "China National Aviation Corporation," are violating international law by using the guise of developing "civilian air transport" to deliver military supplies for the civil war. The No. 89 "C-47" type China National Aviation Corporation transport plane, shot down by the People's Liberation Army at Yulin Airport on October 27th, is further proof of this. According to the captured pilot-in-command, Zhao Ji-tang, the plane was responsible for transporting six tons of military supplies from Xi'an to Yulin, carrying one and a half tons each time. This was the third trip. There was still one and a half tons in Xi'an that had not been transported when the plane was shot down by our army. This shameless act of transporting military supplies with civilian aircraft, according to Zhao's knowledge, has been carried out many times by American pilots. For example, as early as January of this year, the Chiang bandit utilized a China National Aviation Corporation aircraft, piloted by an American, to go to northern Jiangsu and drop flour to the trapped Chiang bandits. Zhao spoke with sorrow and indignation about how the main enterprises under the rule of the Chiang government are controlled by American imperialists, and the China National Aviation Corporation is no exception. Among the company's seventy-plus pilots, only nine are Chinese; the rest are Americans. For the same work and skills, the treatment is very different, with American pilots earning 40 percent more in monthly salary than Chinese pilots. Zhao is from Liaoning, 28 years old this year. He applied to the third class of the aviation school run by the Chiang bandit at the age of 23 and served as a major squadron leader. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, he joined China National Aviation Corporation. He has received preferential treatment from our army since his liberation.

　　蒋美违犯国际公法
    竟用民航机运军火
    【新华社西北十四日电】蒋美合办之“中国航空公司”借发展“民间空运”的美名，违犯国际公法，运送内战军火。十月二十七日解放军在榆林机场击毁之“四七”式八十九号中航运输机即其又一明证。据被俘之该机正机师赵际唐供称：该机负责由西安运送六吨军火至榆林，每次运一吨半，这是第三次，还有一吨半在西安未运，就被我军将该机击毁。以民航机运输军火的无耻行动，仅就赵所知，业已且有多次由美人驾驶。例如早在今年一月间，蒋贼即利用中航机一架，由美人驾驶去苏北，给被困蒋匪投掷面粉。赵悲愤的谈到，蒋政府统治下之主要企业，均操在美帝国主义者手中，中航公司亦不例外；该公司七十余驾驶员中，只有九个是中国人，余均为美人。同样的工作和技术，但待遇却大不相同，美人驾驶员每月薪金较中国驾驶员多百分之四十。赵系辽宁人，现年二十八岁，二十三岁投考蒋贼所办的航空学校第三期航校，曾任少校中队长，抗战胜利后入中航公司，此次获解放后备受我军优待。
