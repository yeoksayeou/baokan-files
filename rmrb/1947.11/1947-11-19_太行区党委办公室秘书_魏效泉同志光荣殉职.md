Comrade Wei Xiaoquan, Secretary of the Office of the Taihang District Party Committee, Gloriously Died in the Line of Duty

[This Newspaper] Comrade Wei Xiaoquan, Secretary of the Office of the Taihang District Party Committee and outstanding correspondent of this newspaper, unfortunately passed away at 8:30 AM on October 31st due to pulmonary tuberculosis and heart disease, despite various treatments. Upon hearing the sad news, all comrades in the Taihang District Party Committee, the Administrative Office, the Xinhua Daily office, and other organizations who knew Comrade Xiaoquan were filled with grief and shed tears. A grand memorial service was held on the 4th of this month at the location of the Taihang District Party Committee to pay public tribute. Representatives from the Administrative Office, Taihang Xinhua Daily, the Shexian County Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Nursery, the Women's Vocational School, and many residents of the area attended. All the representatives present recalled Comrade Xiaoquan's down-to-earth work style, simple life, and selfless dedication to the people, and they were all deeply saddened and missed him. After the meeting, special personnel were sent to escort the coffin back to his hometown for burial. Comrade Xiaoquan was a native of Wuxiang, Shanxi, 29 years old this year. He joined the Communist Youth League in 1933 and officially joined the Communist Party of China in 1937. He successively served as the Minister of Organization of the County Party Committee, Secretary of the County Party Committee, and Secretary-General of the District Party Committee. For more than ten years, he worked diligently and simply, never caring about personal gains or losses. His life was simple, hardworking, and he was steadfast in his dedication to the revolution. During the Anti-Japanese War, he persisted in his work despite the enemy's severe "mopping-up" operations, and was gloriously wounded as a result. He devoted particular effort to the Party's land reform policy and the peasants' emancipation movement, until he fell ill and was bedridden. Even a few days before his death, he was still in the hospital, finding poor peasants and farmhands to investigate and summarize the land reform experience, thinking constantly about the thorough realization of land reform. He worked so hard that he fell ill and never recovered. His spirit of unceasing struggle for the thorough emancipation of the peasants is worthy of our learning. Comrade Xiaoquan was an outstanding correspondent for this newspaper. During his lifetime, in addition to frequently writing articles and winning bonuses, he also constantly provided information and materials, which greatly helped the editorial work. The colleagues of this newspaper are deeply saddened by the premature death of this good comrade and good comrade-in-arms.
