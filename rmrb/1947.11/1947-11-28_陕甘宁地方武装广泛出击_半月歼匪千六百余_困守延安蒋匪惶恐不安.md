Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. Local armed forces and guerrillas in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region have annihilated a large number of enemies and recovered important strongholds. In mid-November, the local armed forces of the Sanbian sub-district, in coordination with the People's Liberation Army, pursued Ma Hongkui's bandit troops who were reinforcing Yulin, capturing over 900 officers and soldiers, including the commander and deputy commander of Ma's Fourth Security Regiment, and seizing 18 light and heavy machine guns. On the southern front, the Luochuan guerrillas, in coordination with the main force, captured Boyi Town in Luochuan on the 24th of last month, annihilating over 300 officers and soldiers of the enemy's Self-Defense Corps. The guerrillas of the Yanshu sub-district implemented extensive joint operations. The joint actions of the guerrillas in Yan'an and Ansai counties have caused panic among the Chiang bandits trapped in Yan'an. In addition to strengthening fortifications, they have also moved military supplies from outside the city into the old city, designated it as a martial law zone, and prohibited the masses from passing through. Last month, the guerrillas of these two counties covered the masses in harvesting autumn fields and repelled the enemy's attempts to seize grain. The Zhidan guerrillas appeared on both sides of the Fu (county) - Gan (quan) highway and cooperated with the guerrillas of these two counties, penetrating deep into the enemy-occupied areas. From the end of last month to the 5th of this month, within a week, they successively recovered five important strongholds in Fuxian County, including Zhangcunyi and Zhiluozhen, and the majority of the defending enemies were annihilated. According to incomplete statistics, the guerrilla forces of the Yanshu sub-district annihilated 229 enemies from October 24th to November 7th, with 113 captured alive. Guerrillas in Guanzhong, Longdong and other places also frequently attacked the enemy. Over the past month, more than 80 stubborn puppet police personnel, intimidated by the prestige of our guerrillas, have defected with their weapons.

  　困守延安蒋匪惶恐不安
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】陕甘宁边区地方武装及游击队大量歼敌和收复重要据点。三边分区地武于本月中旬配合解放军追击增援榆林之马鸿逵匪军，生俘马匪保四团正副团长以下官兵九百余名，缴获轻重机枪十八挺。南线洛川游击队配合主力于上月廿四日攻克洛川之伯益镇，歼敌自卫团官兵三百余人。延属分区游击队实行广泛联合作战，延安、安塞两县游击队的联合行动，使延安被困蒋匪惶恐不安。除加强构筑工事外，并将城外军火物资运入旧城，划为戒严区，不准群众通过。上月该两县游击队曾掩护群众抢收秋田，并击退出犯抢粮之敌。志丹游击队曾出现于富（县）、甘（泉）公路两侧，并与该两县游击队联合作战，深入敌占区，从上月底至本月五日一周内，先后光复富县境内之张村驿、直罗镇等五个重要据点，守敌大部就歼。据不完全统计，延属分区游击武装于十月二十四日至本月七日半月内，歼敌二百二十九名，内生俘一百一十三名，关中、陇东等地游击队亦经常袭击敌人。顽伪保警人员，慑于我游击队声威而携械投诚者月来已有八十余名。
