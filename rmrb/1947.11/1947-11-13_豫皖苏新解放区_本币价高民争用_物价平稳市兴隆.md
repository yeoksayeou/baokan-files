Xinhua News Agency, Front Line of Jiangsu-Shandong-Henan-Anhui, 10th: The Second Administrative Office of Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu has recently established an Industry and Commerce Bureau, and has set up offices and exchanges in Huaiyang, Luyi, and other counties under its jurisdiction, as well as in various market towns. People in the newly liberated areas are vying to use the four types of local currency: Beihai, Luxi, Jinan, and Central China currencies. The exchange rate between the local currency and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit currency is one to twenty-five. At the same time, due to the democratic government's abolition of the exorbitant taxes and levies imposed during the Chiang Kai-shek bandit rule, business in the towns and cities is gradually prospering, prices are stable, and the people's lives are also improving.
