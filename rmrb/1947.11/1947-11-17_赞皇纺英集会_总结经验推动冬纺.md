　　Zanhuang Textile Hero Assembly
    Summarizing Experiences to Promote Winter Textile Production
    [Report from Zanhuang by this newspaper] In order to launch the winter hundred-day textile campaign, Zanhuang specially convened a meeting of textile heroes and district women's chairpersons on the 3rd of this month to summarize several preliminary experiences in leading textile production: (1) When mobilizing, it is necessary to put forward different specific slogans according to different objects. When mobilizing, Hu Yujing, a textile hero from Dahedao, proposed to severely affected disaster households: "In order to overcome the famine, strengthen textile production; even if you don't add a jacket, add sleeves." For households with better harvests, slogans such as "Strive for a life of plenty and a secure foundation" were put forward, and four groups were organized. (2) The masses' concerns about being organized are fear of not being free and dislike of trouble. This is essentially the middle-peasant thinking that capital and labor can be solved by themselves. Therefore, the initial organization must seize the poor and turned-over households severely affected by the disaster as the backbone, promptly commend achievements to influence others, launch competitions to encourage emotions, and organize small cooperatives or several households to jointly select a reliable person to be responsible for going to the market to buy and sell and return labor to others. Six households in Nanyan Village selected one person to go to the market, and each person spun one or two ounces of cotton for him. In order to expand the scope of organization, some adopted a method of calculating points according to the level of technology and distributing dividends according to points. For example, in Wang Yinyin's group in Tian Village, spinning one jin of thread and weaving one bolt of cloth were each worth ten points, and taking care of a child for one day was worth four points. (3) In terms of improving technology: the masses realized that they could not expand sales without improving technology. They opened up their minds by grasping concrete examples of making more money by improving technology. For example, publicizing to the masses the concrete fact that weaving cloth with He Xiyun's fine thread earns two hundred yuan more per jin than weaving cloth with coarse thread had the greatest effect. After summarizing the experience, a hundred-day plan was formulated according to different conditions and different regions. The whole county has a total of 3,810 looms (including four iron looms) and 16,300 spinning wheels. It is striving to weave 578,525 jin of cloth in a hundred days. The textile heroes also formulated specific plans according to the conditions of their own villages, and put forward competition standards to each other at the meeting. Everyone is determined to complete the plan. (Yu Bao, Junzhang)

　　赞皇纺英集会
    总结经验推动冬纺
    【本报赞皇讯】赞皇为了开展冬季百日纺织运动，特于本月三日召开纺织英雄、区妇主席会议，总结了领导纺织的几点初步经验：（一）动员时必须根据不同对象提出不同的具体口号。大河道纺织英雄胡玉憬动员时，对灾荒严重户提出：为了渡荒，加强纺织，不添襟也添袖。对年成较好户则提出：争取丰衣足食安富根等口号，组织了四个组。（二）群众对组织起来的顾虑是怕不自由嫌麻烦，这本质上是资本劳力可以自己解决的中农思想，所以开始组织必须抓住灾荒严重的贫穷翻身户为骨干，及时表扬成绩影响别人，发动竞赛鼓舞情绪，组织小型社或几户共同选一个可靠人，负责赶集买卖别人还工，南延庄六户选一人赶集，每人替他纺一两花。为扩大组织范围，有的采取根据技术高低按工计分，按分分红，如田村王银银组，纺一斤线、织一匹大布都顶十分，领一天小孩顶四分。（三）在提高技术方面：群众认识到非提高技术不能扩张销路，抓住提高技术多赚了钱的具体例子打通思想，如用何喜云细线织布比粗线织布每斤多赚二百元的具体事实向群众宣传，收效最大。总结经验后，按不同条件不同地区，订出百日计划，全县共织机三千八百一十架（内有铁机四架），纺车一万六千三百辆，百日争取织布五十七万八千五百二十五斤。纺英们又各自按照本村条件订出具体计划，并在会上互相提出竞赛标准。每人都抱着完成计划的决心。（玉保、俊章）
