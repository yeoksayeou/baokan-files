The world democratic camp's influence is expanding.
The American people's anti-fascist movement is rising.

Over the past week, the Soviet Union's peace policy has won a great victory in the United Nations General Assembly. After days of fierce debate, the Political Committee of the General Assembly finally defeated the desperate resistance of American and British imperialists and their henchmen (representatives of Turkey, Greece, Chiang Kai-shek, etc.), and unanimously adopted a resolution condemning war propaganda and warmongers. Although the resolution is not the original Soviet proposal, it still includes the basic propositions of the original Soviet proposal. Even the Associated Press had to admit: "This is a moral victory for the Soviet Union."

The adoption of this resolution, and the division in voting on the original Soviet proposal, signifies that the influence of the democratic camp based on the Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries is growing and strengthening. The influence of the imperialist camp headed by the United States is shrinking and weakening. Taking the vote on the original Soviet proposal as an example, 18 countries, including Afghanistan, Egypt, Syria, and Cuba, voted in favor, only five more voted against. Up to now, although many countries, due to fear of American intimidation tactics, or because they have not completely abandoned their illusions about American "aid," etc., dare not break with the United States and openly stand on the side of the democratic camp, they sympathize with the Soviet Union's just propositions, and therefore can only adopt the method of abstaining from voting, which expresses their inner dissatisfaction with the policies of American imperialism. The increasing number of abstentions has become a significant feature since the start of the General Assembly meeting.

The adoption of this resolution also reflects how powerful and irresistible the forces of world people defending peace are. For example, even the U.S. delegation had to be "forced to approve a resolution it opposed," because, if it did not, due to the resolute opposition of the people of the world, "the United States would suffer a complete defeat" (Associated Press). And today, the American people are "uniformly permeated with a feeling, thought, and hope: to oppose warmongers, strengthen international cooperation, and adhere to friendship with the Soviet Union." (Izvestia)

The political situation in France has been extremely tense in the past week. Due to the frantic interference of American imperialism, and the treacherous, anti-communist, and anti-democratic policies of the Ramadier authorities, the arrogance of the fascist de Gaulle elements has been encouraged and condoned. De Gaulle is currently openly instigating all reactionaries to overthrow the current parliament, revise the current new constitution, which is relatively democratic, and use all kinds of intimidation, bribery, and other rogue methods to instigate criminal activities against the republic and the constitution. Ramadier has adopted a despicable policy of compromise, which is essentially that of an accomplice, in order to "cater to the wishes of Washington, hand over the death certificate of French communism to the United States," (according to Duclos of the French Communist Party) and sell France to Wall Street. The French democratic forces, led by the French Communist Party, are actively taking action to defend the republic, defend democracy, and oppose the danger of fascism. Paris workers held angry protest demonstrations, and the General Confederation of Labor of France has issued an urgent call to the working class to "unite all forces to defend the republic and democratic freedom." In factories in Paris, trade union workers have established committees to defend the republic, and worker-peasant committees will soon be formed in various places to lead the anti-fascist struggle. At present, two camps have been formed in France, one is the fascist camp including the "French People's Rally," the current government, and the Socialist Party, and the other is the people's camp led by the French Communist Party, including all democratic people. The tense struggle unfolding between these two camps today, French Communist Party leader Thorez and others have expressed "full confidence in victory" for the people's camp.

Within the United States, a movement to protect human rights and freedom and oppose the danger of fascism is rising. The Truman administration recently implemented a series of reactionary measures persecuting democrats and infringing on human rights, which aroused the righteous indignation of the broad masses of the American people. Following the resolutions of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) and the gathering of 2,000 prominent figures in the American literary world to protest, the American Progressive Citizens Association convened a conference to discuss American civil liberties, attended by celebrities and scholars, calling for efforts to oppose all fascist movements.

### 世界民主阵营影响日益扩大  美国人民反法西斯运动兴起

    世界民主阵营影响日益扩大
    美国人民反法西斯运动兴起
    过去一周，苏联和平政策在联大赢得了伟大的胜利。联大政治委员会经过多日的激烈辩论，终于击败了美英帝国主义及其走卒（土、希、蒋贼代表等）的拼死抵抗，一致通过了谴责战争宣传和战争贩子的决议案。该案虽非苏联的原提案，但仍包括了苏联原提案的基本主张。这连合众社也不得不承认：“这是苏联的道义胜利。”
    这一议案的通过，以及苏联原议案在票决时的分野，标志着以苏联和新民主主义国家为基础的民主阵营，其影响正日益扩大和加强。以美国为首的帝国主义阵营，其影响则日趋于缩小和削弱。即以表决苏联原议案为例，投赞成票的就有阿富汗、埃及、叙利亚、古巴等十八国，反对者仅多五票。迄今为止，虽然许多国家因为慑于美国的恐吓伎俩，或者尚未完全抛弃对美国“援助”的幻想等等原因，因此还不敢和美国决裂，公开站到民主阵营方面来，但它们是同情于苏联的正义主张的，因此只能采取了放弃投票的这一方法，这表示他们对美帝国主义政策的内心不满情绪。放弃投票的日益增多，这已成为联大开会以来的显著特征。
    这一议案的通过，同时反映了世界各国人民卫护和平的力量，是如何强大而不可抗拒。例如，即使美国代表团也不得不“被迫赞成它所反对的议案”，其原因就在于：如果不如此，由于世界人民的坚决反对，“美国便将遭受完全的失败”（合众社）。而今天美国人民也“一致渗透着一种感情、思想和希望：反对战争贩子、加强国际合作、坚持与苏联的友谊。”（消息报）
    法国政局一周来处于极度紧张的情势下。由于美帝国主义的疯狂干涉，和拉马第当局卖国反共反民主的政策，鼓励和纵容了法西斯戴高乐分子的跋扈。戴高乐目前正公开煽动一切反动分子起来推翻现议会，修改比较民主的现行新宪法，并使用一切恐吓、贿买等流氓手段，策动反共和国反宪法的罪恶活动。拉马第对此采取了妥协的实质上是帮凶的可鄙政策，目的在于“迎合华府心意，把法国共产主义的死亡证交与美国，”（法共杜克洛语）并把法国出卖给华尔街。以法共为首的法国民主势力，正在积极行动起来，为保卫共和国、保卫民主和反对法西斯危险而斗争。巴黎工人举行了激愤的抗议示威，法国总工会已向工人阶级发出“团结全部力量保卫共和国与民主自由”的紧急号召。在巴黎各工厂中，工会工人已成立了保卫共和国委员会，各地也即将纷组工农委员会，以领导反法西斯的斗争。目前，法国国内的两个阵营业已形成，一个是包括“法国人民联盟”、现政府和社会党在内的法西斯阵营，一个是以法共为首包括一切民主人民在内的人民阵营。这两个阵营今天所展开的紧张斗争，法共领袖多列士等都表示对人民阵营“充满胜利信心”。
    在美国国内，一个保障人权自由和反对法西斯危险的运动正在兴起。杜鲁门政府最近曾实行了一连系迫害民主人士与侵犯人权的反动措施，激起了美国广大人民的义愤。继产联决议及美国文坛名流二千人集会抗议后，美国进步公民协会又召集了讨论美国公民自由的大会，出席的有名流、学者，呼吁为反对一切法西斯运动而努力。（新华社）
