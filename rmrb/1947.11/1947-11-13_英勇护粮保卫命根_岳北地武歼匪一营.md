　　Heroic Protection of Grain, Defending the Lifeline
　　Local Armed Forces in Northern Yue Annihilate a Bandit Battalion
　　[Our newspaper, Taiyue, 11th dispatch] In the grain protection battle, the local armed forces in Northern Yue annihilated approximately one battalion of Yan Xishan's bandits from the 73rd Division. In order to plunder grain on a large scale, Yan Xishan's bandits ordered the 219th Regiment of the 73rd Division to occupy the area of Baohe and Dajin (20 li south of Jiexiu) from late October. They constantly raided villages such as Zhangbi, Longfeng, and Quchi to plunder grain. On the morning of the 7th, a part of the local armed forces of Northern Yue ambushed between Zhangbi and Lushi, while another part of the militia lured the Yan Xishan's bandits from Baohe. A full battalion of these bandits, totaling 200 men, were mobilized. The militia retreated while fighting, luring the bandits into the ambush circle. Our ambushing troops then launched a full-scale assault, and except for a portion of the bandits who were captured, the majority fled into the Zhangbi Grand Temple, where they were surrounded and annihilated. Yan Xishan's bandits who came from Jiexiu City to provide support were repelled. A total of 52 bandits, including Deputy Battalion Commander Wang Haisheng, were killed, and over 100 were captured alive, including Battalion Commander and Acting 219th Regiment Commander Wang Xizhao. One heavy machine gun, seven light machine guns, two small cannons, 64 rifles, over 5,000 rounds of ammunition, and other military supplies were seized.
　　[Our newspaper, Taiyue, 11th dispatch] In the grain protection battle in Pingyao, from October 25th to the end of the month, five consecutive battles were fought, resulting in a total of 40 Yan Xishan's bandits killed or wounded, and the seizure of three light machine guns, one submachine gun, and two rifles. On October 25th, over 60 armed bandits from the pseudo-Xiude rural areas went to Donghoubi Village to plunder grain. They were repelled by the Liu Jie militia rotation team, with one killed, three wounded, and one submachine gun and one rifle seized. On the same day, over 50 armed bandits from the pseudo-Junzhai rural areas were ambushed by our Second Brigade as soon as they left the village. The enemy fled in disarray, with one killed, four wounded, and one light machine gun seized. Subsequently, the three plundering activities by two battalions of the 2nd Regiment of Yan Xishan's 44th Division on the 26th, over 100 armed bandits from the pseudo-Xiude and Xingcun rural areas on the 28th, and 40 members of the "Struggle Corps" from Dongquan Village on the 29th were successively repelled. Not a single grain was taken away, but a lot of blood was shed.
