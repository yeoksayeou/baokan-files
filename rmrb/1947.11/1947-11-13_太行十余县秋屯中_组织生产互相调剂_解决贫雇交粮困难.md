During Autumn Stockpiling in More Than Ten Counties in Taihang
　　Organize Production and Mutually Adjust to Solve the Difficulties of Poor and Hired Peasants in Delivering Grain
　　[Our Newspaper, Taihang, 10th dispatch] In the process of handing in counter-offensive grain, more than ten counties, including Heshun, Shexian, Lincheng, Qixian, Yexian, Licheng, and Gaoyi, have been paying attention to taking care of the poor and hired peasants and solving the difficulties of the emancipated peasants in handing in grain. In many villages in Shexian, the poor and hired peasants, with the help of cooperatives, organized sideline production to hand in public grain. The poor and hired peasants in Huili Village, with a loan of 600,000 yuan from the cooperative, concentrated indigo worth 1,200,000 yuan and transported it to Xiangyuan, Shanxi, to exchange for rice. This saved their own grain and also handed in good public grain. The cooperative in Xiazhuang Village sold stored rice to the poor and hired peasants at 800 yuan per dou, lower than the market price. Under the slogan "Save grain to survive the famine, hand in public grain through sideline production," Haozhao Village launched a campaign to cut brambles and dig Codonopsis pilosula. Labor hero Zhao Fucheng led 234 men and women laborers in the village to the mountains, and the money they earned in one day was enough to hand in two-thirds of the 13,689 jin of public grain for the whole village. Heshun, Qixian, Yexian, Lincheng, and Gaoyi held forums for the poor and hired peasants, mobilized them to be masters of their own affairs, compared classes and times, and reviewed the summer public grain this year to determine correct methods. At a meeting of poor and hired peasants in the base villages of Chengguan and Dufeng in Lincheng, poor peasant Hou Nianxiao said: "In the past, the burden was handled by clever people who could write and calculate, and they cheated us poor people. Liu Jingyun and Tian Tie both have good land and harvested two or three shi of wheat, but they didn't pay any burden at all. Cai Xiaolin just got emancipated, but he paid one shi and two dou. This is the result of the poor and hired peasants not standing up!" More than ten villages, including Sunjiazhuang in Gaoyi, held forums for the poor and hired peasants to review the heavy burden of the poor and hired in the past. They then launched comparisons of eating and drinking, clothing, emancipation, and careers, believing that those with complete livestock and farm tools should not bear the same burden as those with one leg (shared feeding) and several families sharing one waterwheel, which greatly reduced and solved the difficulties of the poor and hired in bearing the burden. In Yexian, the poor and hired peasants in nine villages, including Xiao Chaoqi Village, held burden forums, proposing "Landlords should pay more, emancipated households should pay less, and the poor and hired should not pay." In the process of handing in grain, some thoroughly emancipated households in Licheng, Shexian, Huguan, Gaoyi, Qixian, and other places promoted class love, actively helped the not-yet-thoroughly-emancipated poor and hired, paid more grain themselves, and conducted mutual adjustments. In Duanjiazhuang, Licheng, 57 emancipated and wealthy peasants paid 1,410 jin of public grain for 23 newly emancipated peasants. Village chief Li Heshang of Gaoyi Village said: "Our cadres not only lead everyone to emancipate themselves and produce, but also have to solve the difficulties of the poor and hired in stockpiling grain." He himself paid 150 jin more. In Xibayu Village, Licheng, newly emancipated households were afraid of suffering losses by exchanging cotton for rice immediately, so rice-rich households immediately lent 12 shi of millet to help 12 poor and hired households solve their difficulties. Political director Li Xiaoshou lent 2 shi and 2 dou himself. Households in Taipei Village that grew more grain lent 24 shi to 56 poor and hired households that grew less grain, so that public grain could be stockpiled quickly.

　　太行十余县秋屯中
  　组织生产互相调剂
  　解决贫雇交粮困难
    【本报太行十日电】和顺、涉县、临城、淇县、邺县、黎城、高邑等十余县，在交反攻粮中注意照顾贫雇，解决翻身农民交粮困难。涉县不少村庄的贫雇，在合作社帮助下，组织副业生产交公粮；会里村贫雇农民，由合作社借给六十万元，集中了价值一百廿万元的靛，运输到山西襄垣去换米。这样即省下了自己粮食，又交了好公粮；下庄村合作社，则将存米每斗低于市价八百元卖给贫雇；郝赵村在“粮食省下渡灾荒，副业生产上公粮”的口号下，展开了割荆条、刨党参运动，劳英赵辅成，带领全村二百三十四个男女劳力上山，一天挣的钱，就交够全村一万三千六百八十九斤公粮的三分之二。和顺、淇县、邺县、临城、高邑召开贫雇座谈会，发动贫雇起来当家作主，划阶级比时光，检讨今年夏季公粮不公定出正办法。临城城关与都丰两基点村贫雇开会，贫雇侯年小说：“过去都是能写会算的有法家搞负担，捉哄咱穷人。刘景云、田铁的都是好地，打了两三石麦子，一点负担也没出。蔡小林刚翻了身，就出了一石二斗，这都是贫雇没起来的结果！”高邑孙家庄等十余村，贫雇座谈，检讨过去贫雇负担重后，展开比吃喝、比穿戴、比翻身、比事业，认为牲口农具齐全的，不能和一条腿（合伙喂）与好几家一个水车的户一样负担，大大减轻与解决了贫雇负担的困难。邺县小朝奇村等九个村贫雇，召开负担座谈会，提出“地主多出，翻身户少出，贫雇不出。”在交粮中，黎城、涉县、壶关、高邑、淇县等地有些翻透身户发扬阶级友爱，纷纷帮助未翻透身的贫雇，自己多交粮，并互相进行调剂。黎城段家庄，五十七家翻透身发了家的农民，替刚翻了身的二十三家农民交公粮一千四百一十斤。高邑村村长李和尚说：“咱们干部不光领导大家翻身生产，屯粮也要解决贫雇困难”。他一个人就多交了一百五十斤；黎城西柏峪村刚翻身的户，种的棉花恐马上换米吃亏，有米户马上自动借出小米十二石，替十二家贫雇解决了困难，政治主任李小瘦，一个人即借出二石二斗；台北村种谷多的户，给五十六户种谷少的贫雇，借出二十四大石，使公粮迅速屯积起来。
