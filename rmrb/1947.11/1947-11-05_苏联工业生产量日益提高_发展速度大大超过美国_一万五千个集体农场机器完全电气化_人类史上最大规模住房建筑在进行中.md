    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st - Moscow Dispatch: TASS recently released various figures proving that the speed of Soviet industrial development has greatly exceeded that of the United States and all other capitalist countries. In 1940, the Soviet Union's industrial production increased twelvefold compared to Tsarist Russia in 1913, while the United States' increase during the same period was less than twofold. If the industrial production of both the Soviet Union and the United States in 1929 is taken as 100, by 1940, the United States had increased to 111, while the Soviet Union had increased to 534. Since 1940, Soviet industrial production has surpassed that of Britain, Germany, and France, ranking first in Europe and second in the world. During the Second World War, although the Hitler bandits caused devastating destruction in the Soviet Union, Soviet industry continued to expand, supplying the Soviet army with first-class weapons and equipment, making victory possible; and laying the foundation for post-war reconstruction. The Soviet industrial recovery was basically completed in 1946, making it the fastest recovery among all countries. The production of civilian goods increased by one-fifth compared to wartime that year; while in the same year, the industrial output of the United States decreased by one-third compared to wartime, and this phenomenon is trending towards expansion and leading to panic. On the contrary, according to the provisions of the new Five-Year Plan, by 1950, Soviet industrial production will exceed the pre-war level by 48 percent.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd - Moscow Dispatch: The national electrification plan in the Soviet Union's new Five-Year Plan is proceeding with all efforts. To date, electricity production has increased nearly fortyfold compared to before the October Revolution, and by the end of this year, it will exceed the pre-war level by 12 percent. By 1950, power generation will reach 82 billion kilowatt-hours, doubling that of 1940. The entire Soviet countryside is rapidly being electrified. Currently, the number of power stations in rural areas is twice that of pre-war. In more than 15,000 collective farms, all machinery and 60 percent of tractor stations have been completely electrified. In some areas, such as the Sverdlovsk region of the Urals, 95 percent of all collective farms have been thoroughly electrified, exceeding the highest electrification level in the United States, California (where only 83 percent of farms are electrified). Thousands of power stations are being repaired and built. The famous Dnieper Hydroelectric Station has been largely restored, and its first turbine began to rotate and generate electricity in January this year, and the second turbine has also been installed. In addition, the second largest hydroelectric station in Europe after the Dnieper, on the Kama River in the Urals, and the largest hydroelectric station in Asia on the Kura River in the Transcaucasus are under construction. The latter is the largest project being carried out by the Soviet Union, and the factory for building this power station alone covers 150 hectares (equivalent to 2,400 mu).
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th - Moscow Dispatch: The largest scale housing construction movement in human history is underway in the western Soviet Union. According to recent statistics from the Soviet State Planning Committee, the total area of urban residential buildings completed in the west in the first nine months of this year has reached more than 1.5 million square meters, and rural residential buildings have reached 153,000. An increase of 10 percent compared to the same period last year. The cruel destruction of the German bandits during the war left 25 million people homeless. The Soviet government has invested a huge amount of 45.3 billion rubles in housing construction to rebuild homes for its people. The investment amount accounts for one-sixth of the total investment in the Five-Year Plan and ranks first among all investments. When the October Revolution Day arrives this year, countless collective farmers, guerrillas, veterans and industrial workers will move from basements, shacks and tents into beautiful new homes with all modern equipment to celebrate the holiday. The newly built rural houses are equipped with electric lights, telephones, heating, running water and sanitary facilities, surrounded by exquisite gardens, and have vegetable gardens for the owners to grow melons, fruits and vegetables. The rural streets are also wide and straight, with trees planted on both sides, and are divided into administrative and residential areas, the former being the concentration of village Soviets, schools, post offices, theaters, and clubs. This kind of construction is the pioneer of the new world's countryside. As for urban housing, the facilities are even more complete. Heroic cities such as Stalingrad, Leningrad, and Sevastopol have become gardens for architects and engineers to express their talents. When the Five-Year Plan is completed, these large industrial centers will appear in a beautiful, garden-like appearance.

    苏联工业生产量日益提高
    发展速度大大超过美国
    一万五千个集体农场机器完全电气化
    人类史上最大规模住房建筑在进行中
    【新华社陕北一日电】莫斯科讯：塔斯社近发表各种数字，证明苏联工业发展之速度，已大大超过美国及其他一切资本主义国家。在一九四○年时，苏联的工业生产量较之一九一三年之沙俄，增加达十二倍，而美国在同期之增加尚不及一倍。如以一九二九年苏美两国之工业生产量各为一○○，至一九四○年美国增至一一一时，苏联则已增至五三四。自四○年以后，苏联工业生产即已超过英、德、法各国而居欧洲第一位，世界第二位。第二次大战中，希特勒匪徒虽在苏联造成毁灭性之破坏，但苏联工业仍继续扩充，供应苏军头等武器及配备，使胜利成为可能；并为战后复员奠定基础。苏联工业复员基本上于一九四六年时即已完成，为一切国家中复员最快者。民用物品生产是年较战时增加达五分之一；而同年美国之工业产量则反较战时减缩三分之一，且此种现象正趋于扩大而导向恐慌。反之，苏联按新五年计划之规定，至一九五○年时，工业生产将超过战前百分之四十八。
    【新华社陕北二日电】莫斯科讯：苏联新五年计划中的全国电气化计划正全力进行中。迄今为止电力生产量已较十月革命前增加几达四十倍，今年年底时，即能超过战前水平百分之十二。至一九五○年，发电量可达八百二十亿千瓦时。较一九四○年将增两倍。全苏乡村，正飞速电气化中。目前乡村之动力站已两倍于战前。在一万五千多个集体农场中，其全部机器与百分之六十的拖拉机站，已完全电气化，若干地区如乌拉尔的西尔得维斯克区的全部集体农场，已有百分之九十五彻底电气化，超过美国电气化程度最高之加利福尼亚州（该州电气化之农场尚仅百分之八十三）。在修复与建造中之动力站数以千计，著名之德聂伯水力发电站，已大部修复，其第一部涡轮已于今年一月开始转动发电，第二部涡轮亦已装妥。此外在乌拉尔加马河上，仅次于德聂伯之欧洲第二大水力发电站，及外高加索库拉河上亚洲最大之水力发电站，均在兴建中。后者乃苏联进行之最大工程，单为建筑此发电站之工厂，即占地一百五十公顷（合二千四百亩）。
    【新华社陕北三十日电】莫斯科讯：人类史上最大规模之住房建筑运动，正在苏联西部进行中。据苏联国家计划委员会最近之统计，今年九个月来西部建成之城市住宅总面积，已达一百五十余万平方公尺，乡村住宅达十五万三千幢。较去年同期增加百分之十。战争时期德寇之残酷破坏使二千五百万人无家可归，苏联政府乃以四百五十三亿卢布之巨大资金，从事住房建筑，为其人民重建家园。其投资额占五年计划总投资额六分之一，而为一切投资额之首位。今年十月革命节来临时，将有无数集体农民游击队员，退伍军人及产业工人，自地室茅舍与蓬帐中迁入具有一切现代设备之美丽新居欢渡节日。新建筑之农村住宅均装有电灯、电话、暖气、自来水及卫生设备，周围绕以精致之花园，并有菜圃，可供主人种植瓜果蔬菜。乡村街道亦均宽阔平直，两旁遍植行道树，并分为行政区与住宅区，前者为村苏维埃、学校、邮局、剧院、及俱乐部集中之地。此种建筑，已为新世界农村之先驱。至于城市房屋，则设备更为完善。英雄城如斯大林勒格，列宁格勒与悉瓦斯托波尔等，已成为建筑家与工程师发抒才能之园地，在五年计划完成之时，此等大工业中心城市将以美丽如花园之姿态出现。
