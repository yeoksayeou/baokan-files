　　Yulin Outskirts: Rout of Enemy Reinforcements
    Our Army Annihilates 4,000 Ma Bandits
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 22nd] The People's Liberation Army routed the Ma Hongkui bandit troops reinforcing Yulin from the 13th to the 15th. It has been confirmed that a total of 4,200 enemy troops were annihilated, including 1,759 captured alive, including the commander of the 4th Regiment, Gong Changshou, the deputy commander, Wei Zhe, and nine company and deputy company commanders and below, and over 2,500 enemy troops killed or wounded, including two deputy company commanders and below.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 20th] At noon on the 15th, after the People's Liberation Army completely routed the Ma Hongkui reinforcement bandit troops, the reporter encountered dozens of officers of the Ma bandits being escorted by our army in a desert area about 40 kilometers west of Yulin, including Ma bandit 4th Regiment Commander Gong Changshou, Deputy Commander Wei Zhe, and four company commanders and two deputy company commanders. When they mentioned the bravery of the People's Liberation Army to the reporter, they were still terrified. They explained their failure, saying, "With such brave troops and strong firepower as yours (referring to the People's Liberation Army), not only can the more than 30,000 reinforcements from Ningxia not withstand it, but even if Chiang Kai-shek sends more reinforcements, they will not be able to withstand it." Commander Gong Changshou hesitated many times and said, "Last time you attacked Yulin city, you eliminated Hu Zongnan's 36th Division. This time you attacked Yulin again, and as a result, we were the first to be hit!" According to their own estimates, more than one-fifth of the Ma bandits were captured, wounded, or fled this time.

　　榆林外围击溃敌增援之役
    我军歼灭马匪四千
    【新华社西北二十二日电】解放军于十三日至十五日，击溃增援榆林之马鸿逵匪部，经查明共歼敌四千二百余名，内生俘保四团团长宫长寿、副团长魏哲及正副营长九名以下一千七百五十九名，毙伤敌两个副营长以下二千五百余名。
    【新华社西北二十日电】十五日正午，解放军完全击溃马鸿逵增援匪部后，记者于榆林西约四十公里之沙漠地区遇见我军解送之数十名被解放军官，其中有马匪保四团团长宫长寿、副团长魏哲和四个营长及两个副营长。他们对记者提及解放军之勇猛时，犹不免谈虎色变。他们纷纷解说其失败说：“象你们（指解放军）这样勇猛的军队和强烈的火力，不仅宁夏这三万多援兵无法抵挡，就是蒋介石再调更多援兵来也抵挡不住。”宫长寿团长迟疑了多次说：“上次你们打了一回榆林城，消灭了胡宗南的三十六师，这次你们又打榆林，结果首先打到我们头上来了！”据他们自己估计，此次马匪被我俘虏和伤亡逃亡的总计在五分之一以上。
