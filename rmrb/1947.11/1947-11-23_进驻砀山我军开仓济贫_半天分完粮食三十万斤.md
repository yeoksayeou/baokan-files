Xinhua News Agency, Frontlines of Su, Lu, Yu, and Wan, 21st: After the People's Liberation Army and the democratic government entered Dangshan, they immediately implemented a policy of opening granaries to relieve the poor. On the morning of the 11th, work teams were dispatched to visit and investigate households, classifying them into three categories—A, B, and C—according to their poverty level and the severity of suffering under Chiang Kai-shek's disasters. "Grain Vouchers" were issued, and several grain distribution areas were designated to facilitate residents' collection. In the afternoon, gongs sounded throughout the city, and teams of impoverished people carrying baskets and sacks flocked to the grain warehouses seized from Chiang Kai-shek's bandits and the homes of bureaucratic despots like Zhang Shoufeng, the secretary-general of the Chiang bandit county party headquarters, to collect grain and ill-gotten wealth. Over 300,000 jin of food grain were distributed in half a day.

Xinhua News Agency, Frontlines of Su, Lu, Yu, and Wan, 21st: A frontline reporter's dispatch describing the situation after the liberation of Dangshan City stated: Half an hour after the battle ended, the PLA assault troops, carrying large quantities of war trophies and escorting long lines of prisoners, withdrew from the urban area. The democratic government then entered the city to reassure the people. Residents who had been hiding from the artillery fire and Chiang Kai-shek's bandits emerged from their cellars, carrying baskets and sacks, asking the PLA and democratic government personnel, "When will you distribute grain?" When they heard the reply, "It will be distributed as soon as the investigation is complete," they were overjoyed. Before being annihilated, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits had frantically set fires, and more than ten important buildings, including the pseudo-county government, the Catholic Church, and the bank, were engulfed in flames. The democratic government immediately led all work teams and guards to rush to put out the fires. In the face of the cold wind and raging flames, all comrades, both men and women, selflessly drew water to extinguish the fires. Nearby residents also came to participate, and after two hours, all the fires were extinguished. After the fires were extinguished, the PLA busied themselves with opening Chiang Kai-shek's prisons, and hundreds of "patriotic prisoners" were able to see the light of day again. When the democratic government explained that they would be given food and sent home, a chorus of "good" immediately rang out from the crowd. An old man with white hair, Li Wendeng, could not express his gratitude and simply bowed repeatedly. An old man named Ning, who lived in the liberated area north of the Yellow River, said, "When you (referring to the PLA) marched northwest, the prison guards taunted us, saying, 'Your protectors have fled northwest! When your protectors come, you can leave without paying!' Now that you have come, we will no longer suffer. You are truly our protectors!" One child, only ten years old, named Hu Yuezhang, had no food at home and begged with his parents in Dangshan City. Chiang Kai-shek's bandits falsely accused him of being a "spy" for the Eighth Route Army, killed his parents, and imprisoned the child for three months.

Work team members went door-to-door in the streets and alleys to offer condolences and distribute "Grain Vouchers." Residents were busy dismantling Chiang Kai-shek's fortifications and retrieving the planks and door panels that had been looted. All reactionary slogans and notices were painted over or torn down, replaced with new slogans welcoming the PLA and the democratic government's public notices to reassure the people.

Before dusk, the sound of gongs resounded through the streets, and residents flocked in groups to Chiang Kai-shek's warehouses to distribute grain. Some people's furniture was too small to hold all the grain, so PLA comrades gave them large burlap sacks. Some were old and weak and could not carry it, so PLA comrades helped them carry it back. They simply repeated the same words to express their heartfelt gratitude: "You are so good! You are so good!"

　　进驻砀山我军开仓济贫
  　半天分完粮食三十万斤
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线二十一日电】解放军与民主政府进驻砀山后，即实行开仓济贫。于十一日晨派出工作队，挨户访问调查，按贫穷程度及受蒋灾轻重，分为甲、乙、丙三等发给“领粮证”，并划分几个领粮区，以便利居民领粮。下午全城锣声四起，成队贫民携筐背袋涌向蒋匪囤粮仓库，及蒋匪县党部书记长张寿峰等官僚恶霸家中领取粮食和浮财，半天内分完食粮三十余万斤。
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线二十一日电】前线记者报导砀山城解放后之情形称：战斗结束后半小时，解放军攻城部队携带大批战利品、押着长列俘虏撤离城关。民主政府随即入城安民，躲避炮火及蒋匪的人民，都从地窖里爬出来，拿着篮、筐、口袋，见解放军和民主政府的人员就问：“你们几时分粮”？当他们听到“调查好了马上就分”的回答时，真是欣喜莫名。蒋匪就歼前，曾疯狂纵火，伪县府、天主堂、银行等十余处重要建筑，正烈火熊熊。民主政府急率所有工作队、警卫队分头驰往扑灭。在寒风烈火前，所有男女同志奋不顾身地引水灌救，附近居民亦赶来参加，两小时后，将所有火头扑灭。火灭后，解放军忙打开蒋匪的监狱，数百名“爱国犯”重见天日。当民主政府说明要发给他们粮食，送他们回家时，人丛里立即响起一片叫“好”声。白发老翁李文登没法表示其感激之情，只是连连作揖。一位家住黄河北岸解放区的宁大爷说：“当你们（指解放军）往西北开的时候，管监的挖苦我们说：‘你们的保人往西北逃啦！等你们的保人来了，不要钱就出去啦！’现在你们一来，我们就不受罪了，真是我们的保人啊！”其中一个才十岁的小孩叫胡月章，家里没吃的，跟爹娘讨乞到砀山城，被蒋匪诬为八路军的“奸细”，把他爹娘杀了，又把小孩关进牢里，已关了三个月。
    工作队员在大街小巷挨门慰问，散发“领粮票”。居民们忙着拆毁蒋匪的工事，取回被劫夺的铺板和门片。一切反动的标语、布告被涂去，被撕毁了，换上了欢迎解放军的新标语，和民主政府的安民布告。
    黄昏前，满街锣声一响，居民们成群结队地涌进蒋匪的仓库去分粮。有的家具太小了，装不完，解放军同志便送给他一只大麻袋。有的年老体弱，扛不动，解放军同志就帮他们抬回去。他们只是用同一语句的反复来表示衷心的感激：“你们真好！你们真好！”
