    Xinhua News Agency, Su-Lu-Yu-Wan Front, 1st: Our front-line reporter reports on the mass movement in the newly liberated areas of Su-Lu-Yu-Wan, stating: Whenever the People's Liberation Army liberates a town, they immediately open granaries to provide relief to the poor. For example, when Taihe was captured, four supply warehouses of the Chiang bandit army were seized. The People's Liberation Army immediately, together with the county's democratic government, opened the warehouses and distributed the massive amounts of supplies to thousands of poor peasants in the nearby suburbs. When entering the South Gate and West Gate of Suxian County, our army, while fighting, strictly set up guards and opened the granaries, distributing tens of thousands of catties of rice and wheat plundered by the Chiang bandits to the people. They disregarded the Chiang bandits' artillery fire and joyfully returned fully loaded. When our army captured the Yejigang Station on the Longhai Railway and passed through Zhaomiao District of Taihe, they assisted the peasants in dividing the ill-gotten wealth of reactionary landlords and local tyrants such as Zhang Wenqing, at the peasants' request. When liberating Fuyang, Eling, Suixian, Yingshang, Zhoujiakou, Zhuxianzhen and other cities, they immediately opened granaries to provide relief to the poor. Wherever the People's Liberation Army arrived, the masses would grab their clothes and weep, demanding assistance in overturning their situation and seeking revenge. The Front Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of our field army established a local work committee in early October, with General Chen Yi personally serving as secretary, to unify the leadership of the army's local work and dispatch a large number of cadres to various places to assist the local party, government, and army in leading the peasants in conducting liquidation struggles and distributing ill-gotten wealth and land. The field army's political department also established a local work group, and each column, division, and regiment established local work teams of hundreds of people. Each party branch established a local work group, and military and government leaders at all levels personally led the work. Generals Chen and Su sent their own guards to assist the peasants in distributing the landlords' grain and wealth and guarding the reactionary landlords. Deputy Chief of Staff General Liu Ruilong gave a special report on "Thoroughly Equally Distributing Land" at a cadre meeting. General Tang Liang attended mass meetings several times to speak, calling on the peasants to overturn their situation and divide the land, and instructed the ministers and section chiefs of the political department to "write a slogan every day and participate in mass meetings at least once a week." Under the strong support of our army and with the assistance of local work teams, peasants in various places have established peasant associations and organized self-defense forces, launching a movement to distribute ill-gotten wealth and land to overturn their situation. Poor peasants dug out the guns that reactionary landlords had cleverly hidden. They carried guns on their backs and warned the local bullies and landlords, saying: "We have guns now. If you want to sabotage, we will have to be rude to you!" The peasants also held meetings and collectively swore: "We will share the blessings together and will never be indecisive!" Peasants who previously had no names (many poor people did not have names) gave themselves new names and wrote them in the peasant association's register. In mid-October, peasants in Huaiyang and Luyi counties held mass rallies of tens of thousands of people one after another. Our army sent work groups to assist them. The broad masses of peasants are now beginning to move from complaining and dividing ill-gotten wealth to equally distributing land. A large-scale mass movement is rapidly developing in the newly liberated areas of Su-Lu-Yu-Wan.

    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线一日电】前线记者报导苏鲁豫皖新区群运称：每当解放军解放城镇时，就立即开仓济贫。如攻克太和时，缴获蒋匪军补给仓库四座，解放军立即会同该县民主政府开仓，将巨量物资散发近郊数千户贫苦农民。攻入宿县南关西关时，我军一面作战，一面严设警戒，打开粮库，把蒋匪搜刮之十几万斤大米、小麦等悉数分给，他们不顾蒋匪炮火，欢天喜天的满载而归。我军攻克陇海路上野鸡岗车站，及经过太和赵庙区时，均应农民之请，协助他们分反动大地主恶霸张文卿等之浮财。解放阜阳、鄂陵、睢县、颖上、周家口、朱仙镇等城市时，皆立即开仓济贫。解放军所到之处，群众均纷纷牵衣哭诉，要求协助翻身复仇。我野战军中共前委会乃于十月初成立地方工作委员会，陈毅将军亲任书记，统一领导全军之地方工作，并派大批干部赴各地协助当地党政军领导农民进行清算斗争，分浮财分土地。野战政治部亦成立地方工作团，各纵队各师各团均成立数百人之地方工作队，党的每个支部都设地方工作组，各级军政首长亲自领导。陈粟两将军曾派自己的警卫员协助农民分地主的粮食财物，看押反动地主。副参谋长刘瑞龙将军特在干部会上作“彻底平分土地”的专题报告。唐亮将军曾数次出席群众大会讲话，号召农民翻身分地，并嘱政治部各部长、科长“每天写一条标语，每星期至少参加一次群众会讲话。”各地农民在我军大力撑腰及地方工作队协助下，纷纷成立农会，组织自卫武装，掀起分浮财分田地的翻身运动，贫苦农民们把反动地主巧计埋藏的枪支都搜挖出来，他们背上枪，警告恶霸地主说：“我们有枪了，如果你要破坏，我们就对不起你！”农民们并开会集体宣誓：“有福同享，决不三心二意！”从前没有名字的农民（穷人很多是没有名字的），都起上新名字写到农会簿子上。淮阳、鹿邑两县农民于十月中旬，先后举行万人大会，我军均派工作团前往协助，广大农民现在开始从诉苦分浮财进入平分土地，大规模群众运动正在苏鲁豫皖新解放地区迅速开展中。
