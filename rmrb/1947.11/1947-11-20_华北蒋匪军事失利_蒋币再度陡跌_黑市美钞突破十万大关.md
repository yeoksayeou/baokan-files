　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: The price hike in the Chiang-controlled areas, which had temporarily halted in late October, has recently begun to fluctuate again. According to a Reuters dispatch from Shanghai on the 17th, prices have generally risen by 10% in the past week. The Chiang currency has fallen sharply. On the 17th, each US dollar had risen to 100,300 Chiang currency, an increase of 17% compared to 88,000 yuan on the 13th. Reuters stated: "The sudden rise in prices is directly related to Chiang Kai-shek's recent military setbacks. It is said that no less than 500 billion yuan of funds fled from cities in North China to Shanghai in the past week. "The capture of Shijiazhuang has accelerated the flight of funds." Chiang Kai-shek's vicious inflation is increasing unabated. According to a Shanghai North China Daily News report on the 16th, citing authoritative sources, the Chiang bandit Central Bank will issue new 1,000-yuan denomination customs gold units (equivalent to 20,000 Chiang bandit "legal tender") next month. These large bills have already been printed locally by the Central Bank and are currently being rushed to various Central Bank branches by airplanes chartered from the "Central" and "China" airlines. It is said that each aircraft can transport new customs gold units worth approximately 500 billion "legal tender." Sources believe that the influx of new denomination banknotes into the market will cause an even more alarming wave of price increases.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: According to an Associated Press dispatch from Beiping on the 15th, prices in Beiping have generally risen recently, and the value of the Chiang currency has plummeted to a record low. On the 14th, each egg was sold for 1,600 yuan, but by the 15th, it had rapidly risen to 2,100 yuan. The black market exchange rate for US dollars had soared to 100,400 Chiang currency per US dollar by the 14th. The Associated Press stated that this phenomenon is a direct reflection of the Chiang bandit's continuous military defeats on the North China battlefield in his anti-popular civil war.

    【新华社陕北十八日电】上月下旬一度停顿的蒋区物价涨风，最近又已开始波动。据路透社十七日沪电，过去一周中，物价已普遍上涨百分之十，蒋币剧烈下跌，十七日每元美钞已涨至蒋币十万零三千元，较十三日之八万八千元已上涨百分之十七。路透社称：物价之陡然上涨与最近蒋介石军事失利有直接关系。据说上周内有不下于五百亿元的资金由华北各城市逃至上海，“石家庄的攻克，使资金逃避加速进行。”蒋介石的恶性通货膨胀有加无已，据上海字林西报十六日引权威方面消息：蒋匪中央银行将于下月发行千元新面额关金券（合蒋匪“法币”两万元，）此项大钞已由中央银行就地印出，刻正租雇“中央”、“中国”两航空公司之飞机赶运新钞至各地中央银行分行，据说每架飞机能运输约值五百亿元“法币”之新关金券。众信：新面额纸币倾入市场，将引起更惊人之物价涨风。
    【新华社陕北十八日电】据美联社北平十五日电报导：近日北平物价普遍上涨，蒋币币值作破记录之暴跌。十四日每枚鸡蛋售价为一千六百元，至十五日即迅速涨达二千一百元。美金黑市汇价，至十四日已飞涨至十万零四千元蒋币兑换一美元。美联社称此种现象系为蒋匪反人民内战在华北战场上不断的军事失利之直接反映。
