Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th: The Yugoslav News Agency, Belgrade, 21st, reported:

    Zhdanov, representative of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), delivered a report on the current international situation at the intelligence conference of the Communist Parties of nine countries held in Poland at the end of September. The full text is excerpted as follows:

    (1) The World Situation After the War

    The Second World War brought about a fundamental change in the entire international situation. The military defeat of the fascist bloc, the anti-fascist nature of the war, and the decisive role of the Soviet Union in defeating the fascist aggressors all led to a drastic change in the balance of power between the socialist system and the capitalist system, which was favorable to socialism.

    The main results of the Second World War were the military defeats of the two most bellicose and aggressive capitalist countries - Germany and Japan. The most reactionary imperialists in the world, especially the British, American and French imperialists, placed special hopes on Germany and Japan (mainly Hitler's Germany), first because this force was most capable of striking the Soviet Union in order to defeat - if not eliminate - it (the Soviet Union), or at least weaken and damage its influence. Secondly, because this force was able to destroy the revolution, workers' and democratic movements in Germany itself and in the countries that Hitler invaded, thereby strengthening the position of capitalism. This is one of the main reasons for the formation of the so-called Munich "appeasement" policy and the instigation of fascist aggression. This "appeasement" policy was persistently pursued by the ruling groups of British, French, and American imperialism.

    However, the hopes that the British, French, and American imperialists placed on the Hitler bandit gang were not realized. The Hitler bandit gang proved to be weaker than the Munich elements had expected, while the Soviet Union and all freedom-loving nations were stronger than the Munich elements had expected.

    Under these circumstances, the entire world capitalist system suffered another serious defeat.

    After being liberated from the enslavement of German fascists, the countries along the Danube then overthrew the bourgeois and large landowners - these rulers who had long been discredited due to cooperation with German fascism. The new people's forces that emerged in the struggle against Hitler and the enslavers came to power.

    The new democratic regimes in Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Albania, relying on the support of the masses of the people, achieved in a very short period of time such progressive democratic transformations that bourgeois democracy had long been unable to achieve.

    A new type of state - the people's republic - was established. There, power belongs to the people, and large industries, transportation, and banks belong to the state; at the same time, the combination of the working people and the working class has become the leading force and the head of the state.

    After the war, the international role and prestige of the Soviet Union (which was the leading force and head in the military defeat of Germany and Japan) has grown immeasurably, and all democratic and progressive forces in the world have united around the Soviet Union.

    The face of the capitalist world has also undergone fundamental changes. Among the six so-called imperialist powers (Germany, Japan, Britain, the United States, France, and Italy), three (Germany, Italy, and Japan) have become powerless due to military defeat, and France has also been weakened and has lost its previous importance as a great power. As a result, only two world imperialist "strong" countries remain - the United States and Britain. However, the position of one of them - Britain - is teetering.

    As a result of the Second World War, the growth of the crisis of the colonial system has been reflected in the powerful national liberation movements in the colonies and dependent countries, which threaten the rear of the capitalist system; the colonial people are no longer willing to live as they did in the past.

    Of all the capitalist powers, only one capitalist power - the United States - was not weakened after the war, but rather was considerably strengthened economically and militarily.

    The end of the war brought a series of new problems to the United States. Capitalist monopolists are striving to maintain their past high levels of profit, and they hope to achieve this by not allowing wartime exports to fall.

    The goal of the new, open expansionist policy of the United States is to establish the world hegemony of American imperialism.

    The new policy line of the United States is the product of a broad program of measures of various economic and political nature. Its purpose is to establish American political and economic dominance over the countries it seeks to expand into, reducing these countries to the status of American vassals; and to establish a regime in these countries to remove all obstacles that the workers' and democratic movements may erect to obstruct American capital from exploiting these countries.

    However, the ambition of the United States to strive for world hegemony is blocked by the Soviet Union (the bulwark of anti-imperialist and anti-fascist policies), whose international influence is growing, by the new democratic countries that have broken free from the control of British and American imperialism, and by the workers of all countries throughout the world (including the American workers within the United States who do not want to wage new wars for the hegemony of their oppressors). Therefore, the new expansionist and reactionary policy line of the United States is intended to fight against the Soviet Union, against the new democratic countries, against the workers' movement in all countries, against the American workers' movement, and against all anti-imperialist and liberation forces in all countries.

    Thus, the openly expansionist plans of the United States are very reminiscent of the shamefully failed adventurous plans of the fascist aggressors; those fascist aggressors, as is well known, were also pursuers of world hegemony not long ago.

    Just as the Hitler bandit gang used "anti-communism" as a smokescreen when preparing for their criminal aggression, so that the possibility of oppressing and enslaving all nations, first and foremost their own people, could be ensured, so now the ruling groups in the United States have put on the mask of the so-called "anti-communist defense mission" for their expansionist policies, and even for attacks on the vital interests of their weaker imperialist competitors (Britain).

    Since the American imperialists regard themselves as the main force opposed to the Soviet Union, opposed to the new democratic countries, opposed to the workers' and democratic movements in all countries, and as the bulwark of reactionary and anti-democratic forces throughout the world, they began to restore the Munich front against the Soviet Union and world democracy as soon as the Second World War ended, and began to instigate reactionary forces - the collaborators and former advocates of capitalism in European countries. And these countries have broken free from the shackles of Hitler and have begun to organize their own lives according to their own choices.

    (2) The New Division of Political Forces and the Formation of Two Camps - the Imperialist Anti-Democratic Camp and the Anti-Imperialist Democratic Camp

    The main leading force of the imperialist camp is the United States, and allied with the United States are Britain and France. Despite the fact that the United States has the Labour government of Attlee and Bevin, and France has the socialist government of Ramadier, Britain and France still follow the imperialist policies of the United States on all basic issues, just like satellites of the United States. The imperialist camp is supported by countries such as Belgium and the Netherlands that possess colonies, countries such as Turkey and Greece that have reactionary and anti-democratic regimes, countries in the Near East and South America, and countries such as China that are politically and economically dependent on the United States.

    The anti-imperialist and anti-fascist forces have formed another camp, the foundation of which is the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries. This camp is composed of countries that have already broken free from the shackles of imperialism and have firmly embarked on the road of democratic development, such as Romania, Hungary, and Finland. Indonesia and Vietnam are in step with the anti-imperialist camp, while India, Egypt, and Syria express sympathy for the anti-imperialist camp. The anti-imperialist camp relies on the workers' and democratic movements in all countries, relies on the fraternal communist parties in all countries, relies on the fighters of the national liberation movements in the colonies and dependent countries, and relies on all progressive and democratic forces that exist in every country. The purpose of this camp is to oppose new wars and imperialist expansion, strengthen democratic forces, and eradicate fascist remnants.

    The end of the Second World War has placed a major task before all freedom-loving nations, which is to ensure a stable and democratic peace in order to consolidate the victory over fascism.

    All the forces in the anti-imperialist and anti-fascist camp have united and gathered together to ensure the task of a just and democratic peace. On this basis, the friendly cooperation between the Soviet Union and the democratic countries on all foreign policy issues has grown and strengthened. The establishment and growth of the international prestige of the democratic camp is not in line with the wishes of the imperialists. Even during the Second World War, the reactionary forces in Britain and the United States had been constantly strengthening their activities, trying to undermine the unified action of the Allies, prolong the war, weaken the Soviet Union, and save the fascist aggressors from complete defeat.

    However, while the war was still going on, the reactionary elements in Britain and the United States did not dare to provoke the Soviet Union and the democratic countries, knowing very well that the broad masses of the people throughout the world sincerely sympathized with the latter. But in the last few months as the war was nearing its end, the situation began to change. As early as the Three-Power Berlin Conference in July 1945, the British and American imperialists had already revealed their unwillingness to consider the legitimate interests of the Soviet Union and the democratic countries.

    The foreign policy of the Soviet Union and the democratic countries over the past two years has been a policy of fighting to uphold the democratic principles of the post-war world. Therefore, the main task of the post-war foreign policy of the democratic countries is to fight for democratic peace, for the elimination of fascist remnants and for the prevention of the revival of fascist imperialist aggression, for the affirmation of the principle of equality of all nations and respect for the sovereignty of all nations, and for universal disarmament and the prohibition of the use of those most destructive weapons used to exterminate peaceful people on a large scale. In solving all these problems, the diplomacy of the Soviet Union and the diplomacy of the democratic countries have encountered resistance from the diplomacy of Britain and the United States. Since the end of the war, the diplomacy of Britain and the United States has consistently followed the following line: abandoning the general principles of post-war world construction announced by the Allies during the war, abandoning this policy of peace and strengthening democratic forces, and replacing it with a new policy of undermining universal peace and protecting fascists, and persecuting democratic forces in all countries.

    The aim of the diplomacy of the Soviet Union and the democratic countries is to solve the problem of disarmament and the prohibition of the use of particularly destructive weapons such as atomic bombs; their joint diplomatic activities have significant significance.

    The foreign policy of the Soviet Union proceeds from the fact that the two systems of capitalism and socialism will coexist for a long period of time to come. Based on this fact, there is a possibility of cooperation between countries with different systems, provided that both sides adhere to the principle of mutual respect and fulfill the obligations of mutual commitments. The Soviet Union has proved its willingness and desire to cooperate with facts.

    The current policy of Britain and the United States is completely different from this. They are doing everything in their power to abandon the obligations they previously undertook, in order to brazenly carry out a new policy, a new policy that does not promote cooperation among nations but rather instigates one nation against another, undermines the interests of the democratic people of all countries, and isolates the Soviet Union.

    Since the United States has abandoned Roosevelt's old policy and is now pursuing a new policy - a policy of preparing for new war adventures; now, in this new situation, this policy is being vigorously pursued.

    (3) The American Plan to Enslave Europe

    After the end of the Second World War, American imperialism began to adopt a policy of aggression and open expansionism externally and internally, such as actively supporting anti-democratic and reactionary forces throughout the world, abolishing the Potsdam Agreement aimed at the democratization and demilitarization of Germany, protecting reactionary elements in Japan, expanding war preparations, and accumulating atomic bomb reserves. At the same time, it attacked the basic democratic rights of the working people in the United States.

    The expansionist foreign policy encouraged and implemented by the American reactionary groups is also manifested in the following aspects: 1. Military strategic measures; 2. Economic expansion; 3. Ideological struggle.

    The implementation of the military strategic plan for future aggression is closely linked to the ambition of the United States to try to make the most of its war industrial equipment, which has grown enormously at the end of the Second World War.

    The cost of maintaining the American army accounts for 35 percent of the national budget for 1947-48, and the number of its troops is eleven times that of 1937-38.

    The American military strategic plan stipulates that numerous bases should be established in peacetime far from the American continent, intended to be used against the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries.

    Although the war has been over for a long time, the British-American military alliance, and even the British-American Joint Chiefs of Staff, still exist.

    Under the smokescreen of "Western Hemisphere Defense," Latin American countries are being included in the scope of the American military expansion plan. The American government has announced that helping to modernize the Turkish army is its official task. The reactionary Kuomintang army is being trained by American instructors and is receiving American technical equipment.

    American economic expansion is an important supplement to the realization of its strategic plan. American imperialism, in the guise of a usurer, is doing its best to take advantage of the post-war difficulties of the European countries that suffered the most losses during the war, especially the lack of raw materials, fuel, and food among the allied countries, to force them to obtain assistance only if they obey the conditions of exploitation.

    However, closely following economic control, the countries are reduced to the servants of the American imperialists. In this way, the expansion of territory by monopoly capitalists to dump American goods is combined with the American seizure of a staging ground for the struggle against the new democratic countries in Europe.

    Finally, the American ambition to strive for world hegemony and anti-democratic policies also includes ideological struggle. The basic task of the ideological part of the American strategic plan is to exert pressure on public opinion, spread slanders about the so-called "aggressiveness" of the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, and portray the British-American group as "defending themselves," and shift the blame for preparing for a new war to this group. During the Second World War, the prestige of the Soviet Union abroad increased enormously. The reactionary elements in the United States and Britain are anxiously calculating how to erase the indelible impression of the socialist order living in the hearts of the workers and working people of the world. The instigators of a new war understand very well; before they can send troops to attack the Soviet Union, they must carry out a long period of ideological preparation.

    One of the methods of the ideological "offensive" accompanying the plan to enslave Europe is to infringe on the principle of national sovereignty, to make all ethnic groups abandon their right to autonomy, and to oppose this right with the concept of a "world government." The intention of this offensive is to embellish the unbridled expansion of American imperialism, which ruthlessly tramples on the autonomous rights of all ethnic groups, and to portray the United States as a "fighter for maintaining the laws of all mankind."

    In the current situation, the specific manifestations of American expansionist tendencies are the "Truman Doctrine" and the "Marshall Plan." Although these two documents are different in form, they are essentially a manifestation of the same policy, and these documents are excuses for the United States to enslave Europe.

    The main characteristics of the "Truman Doctrine" for Europe are as follows: (1) Establishing American bases in the eastern Mediterranean region, with the aim of establishing American control over this region. (2) Actively supporting the reactionary regimes in Greece and Turkey, making them the bulwark of American imperialism against the new democratic countries in the Balkans. (3) Imposing great pressure on the new democratic countries, attacking the pioneers of the new democratic regimes, attempting to interfere in the internal affairs of these countries, instigating all anti-national and anti-democratic elements in these countries, demonstrating severance of economic ties with these countries, with the aim of creating economic difficulties for these countries, delaying their economic development, sabotaging their industrial construction, etc.

    The "Truman Doctrine" encountered an unfavorable response, so that the "Marshall Plan" had to be proposed. It is a more covert attempt to implement the policy of expansion.

    The essence of the "Marshall Plan," in its verbal and particularly circuitous program, is to create a group of countries by attracting some countries jointly bound by the United States, and to lend American credit to European countries, requiring them to first give up their economic independence and then give up their political independence. At the same time, the basis of the "Marshall Plan" is to establish the West German industrial zone and make it controlled by American monopoly capital.

    According to the instructions issued by Washington, the British and French governments invited the Soviet Union to participate in the discussion of the Marshall proposal. This step was to cover up the sinister anti-Soviet nature contained in the Marshall proposal.

    After agreeing to discuss the Marshall proposal together with the British and French governments in Paris, the Soviet delegation pointed out at the Paris talks that the task of the so-called entire European economic program was unfounded, and revealed the following attempts, namely, to create interference in the internal affairs of European countries and undermine their sovereignty in the form of new European organizations under the protection of the British and French governments.

    This clear attitude of the Soviet Union exposed the masks of the American imperialists and their British and French henchmen. Due to the refusal of nine European countries to participate, the all-European conference collapsed shamefully. However, the attempt to establish a Western group under American protection is still continuing.

    It must be emphasized that the heroes of the American Western group will inevitably encounter serious resistance, and even countries like Britain and France that rely on the United States will resist.

    Here, we can see one of the main contradictions of the British, American, and French groups themselves. American monopoly capitalists, as well as the entire international reactionary派, seem to have estimated that Franco or the Greek fascists cannot become reliable supporters of American anti-Soviet and anti-new democratic countries in Europe. Precisely for this reason, they place special hopes on the revival of imperialist Germany, believing that this is the most important guarantee for obtaining victory in the struggle against the democratic forces in Europe.

    This is why the German issue, especially the issue of the Ruhr region as a potential anti-Soviet military industrial base, has become the most important issue of international policy, and has become an issue of conflict between the United States and Britain and France.

    In this way, the Western group that the United States is establishing is not in accordance with Churchill's "United States of Europe" plan, which was conceived as a medium for implementing British policies, but rather uses European sovereign countries (including Britain itself) as protectorates of the United States, making them play roles similar to the famous "forty-ninth state of the United States."

    The praise of the Marshall Plan by some countries and militarist camps fully confirms the entire course of events.

    As for the "Marshall Plan," the democratic countries' camp has shown itself to be a powerful force. They insist on defending the independence and sovereignty of all European countries, and will never allow themselves to be intimidated, just as they will not allow themselves to be deceived by the hypocritical tricks of dollar diplomacy.

    It must also be remembered that the United States itself is threatened by an economic crisis. There is a deep reason for Marshall's "magnificent" "generosity." As long as the European countries do not receive American loans, then the demand of these countries for American goods will inevitably decrease, and this will accelerate the imminent arrival of the American economic crisis. For this reason, if the European countries show the necessary firmness and determination to resist the enslaving conditions of American loans, the United States may be forced to retreat.

    (4) The task of the Communist Party is to unite the democratic, anti-fascist, and peace-loving forces in the struggle against the new war and aggression plans.

    The dissolution of the Communist International was in line with the needs of the development of the workers' movement under new historical conditions, and its dissolution played a positive role.

    In the four years since the dissolution of the Communist International, we have seen a great increase in the Communist Parties of all countries, and in fact their influence has increased in all countries in Europe and Asia.

    The influence of the Communist Parties in the new democratic countries has increased especially, where the Communist Party is the most powerful party in the country.

    However, there are also certain shortcomings in the current situation of the Communist Party. Some comrades have had such an understanding that the dissolution of the Communist International means the elimination of all connections and all contacts between the fraternal Communist Parties. However, experience tells us that this lack of contact between the Communist Parties is incorrect, harmful, and actually unnatural. Undoubtedly, if this situation continues, it will cause extremely harmful consequences to the development of the cause of the fraternal parties.

    Since most of the leading organs of the socialist parties (especially the British Labour Party and the French Socialist Party) have become agents of the American imperialist elements, therefore, a special historical task - leading the resistance to the American plan to enslave Europe, and bravely uniting to expose the American imperialist henchmen in all countries - falls on the shoulders of the Communist Party. At the same time, the Communist Party must support all true patriots who are fighting to prevent their motherland from being infringed upon, to oppose the enslavement of their motherland by foreign capital, and to defend their national sovereignty. The Communist Party must become the leading force in uniting all anti-fascist and freedom-loving forces to carry out the struggle against the new expansionist plan of American enslavement of Europe.

    It must be remembered that there is a great distance between the desire of imperialism to launch a new war and the possibility of organizing this war. The people of all ethnic groups throughout the world do not want war.

    The main danger for the working class now is to underestimate its own strength and overestimate the strength of the enemy.

    If the Communist Party adheres to its position, defends the consolidation of peace, the people's democracy, national sovereignty, and the freedom and independence of their country, and if they know how to lead all forces willing to defend the glorious cause and national independence in the struggle against attempts to economically and politically enslave their country, then no plan to enslave Europe can be realized.

    欧洲九国共产党华沙会议上
    日丹诺夫报告国际形势
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】南斯拉夫通讯社贝尔格莱德二十一日讯：
    苏联共产党（布尔塞维克）中央委员会代表日丹诺夫于九月底在波兰举行的九国共产党情报会议上发表目前国际形势的报告，全文节录如下：
    （一）战后世界形势
    第二次世界大战，使整个国际形势起了根本变化，法西斯国家集团的军事失败，战争的反法西斯性质，苏联在战胜法西斯侵略者当中的决定作用，这一切使社会主义制度与资本主义制度相互力量的对比，起了有利于社会主义的急遽改变。
    第二次世界大战的主要结果是：最黩武、最富侵略性的两个资本主义国家——德国和日本军事上的失败。全世界反动帝国主义分子，特别是英美法帝国主义分子，曾对德、日（主要是希特勒德国）寄托了特别的希望，首先因为这力量最能予苏联以打击，以便击败——如果不是消灭——它（苏联），至少也要削弱与损害它的影响。其次，因为这力量是能摧毁德国本国和希特勒侵略对象国家的革命，工人与民主的运动，从而增强资本主义的地位。所谓慕尼黑“绥靖”政策与煽动法西斯侵略的所以形成，其主要原因之一就在于此。这种“绥靖”政策，是英、法、美帝国主义统治集团所坚持力行的。
    可是，英法美帝国主义者寄托在希特勒匪帮身上的希望，并没有实现。希特勒匪帮业经证明较之慕尼黑分子所预料的为弱，而苏联与爱好自由各民族，都较慕尼黑分子所预料的为强。
    在这种情况下，整个世界资本主义制度遭受了又一个严重的失败。
    多脑河各国，从德国法西斯奴役下解放出来之后，接着就推翻了资产阶级与大地产所有主——这些由于德国法西斯主义合作而早已声名狼藉了的统治者。出来当权的，乃是在反对希特勒，奴役者的斗争中涌现出来的新的人民的力量。
    南斯拉夫、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、波兰、捷克斯拉夫、匈牙利、阿尔巴尼亚的新民主主义政权，依靠人民群众的支持，在很短期间，即实现了资产阶级民主政治早已不能实行的那样进步的民主的转变。
    新型的国家——人民的共和国，建立起来了。在那里，政权属于人民，大工业、运输与银行属于国家；同时，劳动人民与工人阶级的结合，成为领导的力量与国家的首脑。
    战后苏联（它是使德、日两国军事失败的领导力量和首脑）的国际作用和威信，已无限量地增长了，全世界一切民主进步力量都团结在苏联周围。
    资本主义世界的面貌也起了根本的变化。在六个所谓帝国主义列强（德、日、英、美、法、意）中，有三个（德、意、日）由于军事失败业已无能为力，法国也已削弱并丧失了其先前作为强国的重要性。这样一来，只剩下两个世界帝国主义“强”国——美、英。但是，其中一个——英国的地位正在摇摇欲坠。
    由于第二次世界大战的结果，殖民地制度危机的增长已反映在殖民地和附属国强大的民族解放运动上，这威胁着资本主义制度的后方；殖民地人民是再也不愿象过去一样的生活下去了。
    所有资本主义列强中，只有一个资本主义强国——美国——在战后没有受到削弱，反而在经济和军事方面都有相当的增强。
    战争的结束，使美国面临着一串新问题。资本主义独占者力图保持他们过去那样高度水平的利润，他们希望以不使战时货物输出额跌落的办法来达到这个目的。
    美国新的、公开的扩张主义政策的目的，就在于建立美帝国主义的世界霸权。
    美国新的政策路线，乃是各种经济与政治性质的措施的广泛纲领的产物。其目的是：建立美国对其扩张对象国家的政治与经济统治，使这些国家降为美国附庸国的地位；并在他们国内树立一种政权，以扫除工人与民主运动可能筑起的阻挠美国资本剥削这些国家的一切障碍。
    然而，美国争取世界霸权的野心，却受到国际影响日益增长的苏联（反帝国主义与反法西斯政策的堡垒）的阻挡，受了从英、美帝国主义控制下挣脱出来的新民主主义国家和全世界所有各国工人（包括美国国内不愿为了他们的压迫者的霸权而进行新战争的美国工人）的阻挡。因此，美国新的扩张主义与反动的政策路线，就是打算对苏联，对新民主主义国家，对一切国家的工人运动，对美国工人运动，和对一切国家反帝国主义及解放势力进行斗争。
    这样，美国公开的扩张计划，很使人想起法西斯侵略者可耻地失败了的冒险计划；那些法西斯侵略者，如所周知，不久以前也还是世界霸权的追求者。
    正象希特勒匪帮在准备罪恶的侵略时、以“反共”为烟幕，使压迫与奴役各民族、首先是他们本国人民的可能性能够确保一样，如今，美国的统治集团也给他们的扩张政策，甚至对其较弱的帝国主义竞争者（英国）的切身利益的进攻，戴上了所谓“反共防御任务”的假面具。
    美帝国主义者既然把自己当作和苏联对立、和新民主主义国家对立、和世界各国工人与民主运动对立的主要力量，当作全世界反动、反民主力量的堡垒，就在第二次世界大战刚一结束，便着手恢复反对苏联与世界民主主义的慕尼黑阵线，着手鼓动反动势力——欧洲国家的通敌分子与过去资本主义的鼓吹者。而这些国家却已摆脱了希特勒的羁绊，并开始依照自己的选择来组织自己的生活。
    （二）战后政治力量的新的划分与两个阵营的形成——帝国主义反民主阵营及反帝国主义民主阵营
    帝国主义阵营的主要领导力量是美国，与美国相联合的则有英国与法国。尽管美国有艾德礼、贝文的工党政府，法国有拉马第的社会党政府，英、法在一切基本问题上却还是象美国的卫星国一样跟着美国的帝国主义政策跑的。帝国主义阵营获得如下各国的支持：即比利时与荷兰之类拥有殖民地国家、土耳其与希腊之类反动反民主政权国家、近东与南美各国以及中国之类政治上与经济上依赖美国的国家。
    反帝国主义与反法西斯力量则结成另一个阵营，这个阵营的基础，就是苏联与新民主主义国家。这个阵营是由那些已经挣脱了帝国主义羁绊、坚定地走上了民主发展道路的国家，如罗马尼亚、匈牙利与芬兰等组成的。与反帝国主义阵营步调一致的，有印尼、越南，而印度、埃及与叙利亚，则对反帝国主义阵营表示同情。反帝国主义阵营依赖着各国工人与民主运动，依赖着各国的兄弟共产党，依赖着各殖民地与附属国家的民族解放运动的战士，依赖着存在于每一个国家中的一切进步民主力量。这一阵营的目的，就是反对新战争与帝国主义的扩张，加强民主力量，根绝法西斯残余。
    第二次世界战争的结束，已经把一个主要的任务放在一切爱好自由的民族面前，这就是保证稳固的民主的和平，以巩固对法西斯主义的胜利。
    反帝国主义与反法西斯阵营中的一切力量，已经为保证正义的民主的和平任务而团结和聚集起来了。在这个基础上，苏联与民主国家在一切外交政策问题上的友谊合作，业已增长并加强了。民主阵营国际威信的确立和增长，是不合帝国主义者的意思的。甚至在第二次世界大战期间，英美反动势力就已经不断地加强他们的活动，力图破坏盟国间的统一行动，延长战争，削弱苏联并挽救法西斯侵略者免于全面失败。
    但是，当战争还在继续的时候，英美的反动分子还不敢对苏联与民主国家挑衅，他们知道的很清楚，全世界人民大众是衷心同情后者的。但在战争将近结果的最后几个月中，情势就开始改变。早在一九四五年七月三强柏林会议期间，英美帝国主义者就已经显露出他们不愿考虑苏联与民主国家的正当利益。
    苏联与民主国家过去两年中的外交政策，乃是为坚持实现战后世界民主原则而斗争的政策。因此，民主国家战后外交政策的主要任务，就是为民主的和平、为肃清法西斯残余并为防止法西斯帝国主义侵略复活、为确认各民族平等的原则与尊重各民族的主权、为普遍缩军与禁止使用那些用以大规模灭绝和平人民的具有最大毁灭性的武器而斗争。在解决这一切问题中，苏联的外交与民主国家的外交，遇到了英、美外交的抵抗。自战争结束以后，英、美的外交就一贯地遵循着下述的路线：即抛弃盟国战时所宣布的关于战后世界建设的一般原则，摒除这个和平与加强民主力量的政策，而代以破坏普遍和平和庇护法西斯分子、迫害各国民主力量的新政策。
    苏联与民主国家外交的目的，在于解决缩军与禁止使用有特别毁灭性武器原子弹的问题；它们的共同外交活动，具有显著的意义。
    苏联的外交政策，是以资本主义与社会主义两个制度在今后一个长时期内并存的事实出发的。根据这一事实，制度不同的国家，在双方恪守互相尊重的原则并履行共同承诺的义务的条件下，便有了合作的可能性。苏联已经用事实证明了它的合作的意志与愿望。
    英美现行的政策，则与此完全不同。他们正在竭尽一切力量来抛弃以前承受过的义务，以便放肆进行一种新政策，一种并非促进各民族合作而是鼓动一个民族反对另一民族、破坏各民主人民的利益，并孤立苏联的新政策。
    美国既然背弃了罗斯福的旧的方针，而且正奉行着新的政策——准备新战争冒险的政策；现在，在这种新形势中，这一政策就正被竭力推行着。
    （三）美国奴役欧洲的计划
    二次世界大战结束后，美帝国主义对外对内开始采取侵略与公开扩张主义的政策，如积极支持全世界反民主的反动力量，废除以德国之民主化与非军国主义化为目的的波茨顿协定，庇护日本的反动分子，扩充战争的准备，积蓄原子弹储备。与这同时，又进攻美国国内劳动人民的基本民主权利。
    美国反动集团所鼓舞与执行的扩张主义的外交政策，同时还表现于如下各方面的活动：一、军事战略措施；二、经济扩张；三、思想斗争。
    未来侵略的军事战略计划的实现，和美国企图尽量利用其在二次大战末期所极度增长了的战争工业装备的野心，是密切联系在一起的。
    美国维持军队的费用，占一九四七——四八年全国预算百分之三十五，其军队数量为一九三七——三八年的十一倍。
    美国军事战略计划规定，在平时就在远离美洲大陆的地方建立无数基地，打算充作反对苏联及新民主主义国家之用。
    虽然战争结束已久，英美军事同盟，甚至英美联合军事参谋部都仍然存在。
    在“西半球联防”的烟幕下，拉丁美洲国家正被包罗在美国军事扩张计划的范围以内。美国政府已宣布，帮助土耳其军队现代化，乃是他的正式的任务。反动的国民党军队受到美国教官的训练，并获得美国技术的装备。
    美国的经济扩张，是实现其战略计划的重要补充。美帝国主义以高利贷者的姿态，尽力利用战时遭受损失最大的欧洲国家战后的困难，特别是盟国中原料、燃料与食物的缺乏，来迫使他们除非听命于被剥削的条件，否则就不能取得援助。
    但是，紧随经济控制之后，各国就被沦为美帝国主义者的奴仆。这样，独占资本家为倾销美国货而扩充地盘，是与美国攫取反对欧洲新民主主义国家斗争的屯兵场相结合的。
    最后，在美国争取世界霸权与反民主政策的野心中，也包括着思想斗争。美国战略计划中思想部分的基本任务，是对舆论施行压力，散播所谓苏联及新民主主义国家的“侵略性”的诽谤，并且把英美集团描绘为“防卫自己”，并把这个集团准备新战争的罪责推开。在第二次世界大战过程中，苏联在国外的威信极大量地增长了。美国与英国的反动分子，很焦急地盘算着要怎样才能抹去社会主义秩序活在世界工人与劳动人民心中的不可磨灭的印象。新战争的挑拨者们很了解；在他们能够派遣军队进攻苏联以前，必须进行长期的思想准备。
    伴随着奴役欧洲的计划而来的思想“攻势”的方法之一，就是侵犯国家主权的原则，要使各族人民放弃他们的自主权利，并以“世界政府”的观念来反对这种权利。这种攻势的用意在于：把无情地蹂躏各族人民自主权利的美帝国主义肆无忌惮的扩张加以粉饰，并把美国描写成为“维护全人类法律的战士”。
    在目前情况下，美国扩张主义倾向的具体表现，就是“杜鲁门主义”与“马歇尔计划”。这两个文件在形式上虽然各有不同，但在实质上都是一个政策的表现，这些文件，都是美国奴役欧洲的借口。
    “杜鲁门主义”对于欧洲说来，其主要特点如下：（一）在东地中海区建立美国基地，目的在于确定美国在这一地区的统治权。（二）积极支持希腊和土耳其的反动政权，使之成为美国帝国主义反对巴尔干新民主主义国家的堡垒。（三）以所谓集权主义与扩张企图等虚构、谴责，对新民主主义国家施行很大压力，攻击新民主主义政权的先驱者，力求干涉这些国家的内政，唆使这些国家内一切反国家反民主的分子，示威式地断绝与这些国家的经济联系，目的则在制造这些国家的经济困难，拖延其经济发展，破坏其工业建设等等。
    “杜鲁门主义”遭到不利的反应，以致不得不提出“马歇尔计划”。它是实施扩张政策的一种更为隐蔽的企图。
    “马歇尔计划”口头上的特别是迂回曲折的方案，其主旨在于以拉拢一些共同受美国约束的国家，创立一国家集团，并以美国的信用贷款借给欧洲国家，要它们首先放弃其经济独立，然后在放弃其政治独立。同时，“马歇尔计划”的基础在于建立德国西部工业区，使之为美国独占资本所控制。
    依照华盛顿所发出的指令，英法政府邀请苏联也参加马歇尔建议的讨论。这个步骤，乃是要掩饰马歇尔建议所含反苏联的阴险的性质。
    同意与英法政府共同在巴黎讨论马歇尔建议后，苏联代表团便在巴黎会谈中指明所谓整个欧洲经济纲领的任务是没有根据的，并揭露了如下的企图，即在英法政府保护下，以新欧洲组织的形式造成干涉欧洲国家的内政，并破坏它们主权的危险。
    苏联这种明确的态度，揭破了美帝国主义者及其英、法帮手的假面具。由于欧洲九个国家拒绝参加，全欧会议可耻地垮台了。然而，在美国保护下成立西方集团的企图，仍在继续着。
    必须强调指出，美国西方集团的好汉们必然会遇着严重的抵抗，甚至倚赖美国的英法之类的国家也会抵抗。
    在这里，我们可以看到英美法集团本身的主要矛盾之一。美独占资本家以及整个国际反动派，似乎估计到佛朗哥或希腊法西斯不可能成为美国反苏及反欧洲新民主主义国家的多少可靠的支持者。正因为如此，他们就对帝国主义德国的复活寄以特别的希望，认为要求得反对欧洲民主力量的斗争之胜利，这是最重要的保证。
    这就是为什么德国问题、特别是作为潜在的反苏军事工业基地的鲁尔区问题，成了国际政策的最重要问题，成了美国与英法间冲突的问题的原因。
    这样看来，美国正在建立的西方集团，并不是依照邱吉尔的“欧洲合众国”计划，这计划曾被设想为实行英国政策的媒介，而是以欧洲主权国家（英国自己也在其内）作为美国的保护国，使它们扮演着和著名的“美国第四十九州”差不多的角色。
    有些国家与军国主义阵营对马歇尔计划的赞扬，充分证实了整个事实的过程。
    对“马歇尔计划”说来，民主国家阵营表现了自己是一支强大的力量，他们坚持保卫一切欧洲国家的独立与主权，决不让自己被恐吓吓倒，恰如也不允许被金元外交的虚伪诡计所欺骗一样。
    还须要记住：美国本身正受着经济危机的威胁。马歇尔“冠冕堂皇”的“慷慨好义”，是有它深刻的原因的。只要欧洲国家得不到美国的贷款，那末这些国家对美国货的需求就必然会减少，这样就将加速迫在眉睫的美国经济危机的来势。因为这个缘故，如果欧洲国家表现必要的坚定与决心，以抵抗美国贷款的奴役性条件的话，美国是可能被迫撤退的。
    （四）共产党的任务是在反对新的战争和侵略计划的斗争中团结民主的反法西斯爱好和平的力量
    共产国际的解散，是适应新的历史条件下工人运动发展的需要的，它的解散起了积极的作用。
    在共产国际解散以来的四年中，我们亲眼看到各国共产党大大的增强，实际上在欧洲和亚洲所有国家里他们的影响都增强了。
    新民主主义国家共产党的影响尤其增强，在那里共产党是国内最有势力的政党。
    可是，在共产党目前的情况中，也有某些缺陷存在。有些同志曾有这样的了解，以为共产国际的解散，即意味着各兄弟共产党之间的一切联系与一切接触的消除。然而，经验告诉我们：共产党之间这种缺乏联系，是不正确的，有害的，并且实际上是不自然的。无疑的，这种情况假如继续下去，对各兄弟党事业的发展就会引起极为有害的后果。
    由于社会主义政党（特别是英国工党和法国社会党）大部分领导机关已成了美帝国主义分子的代理人，因此，一个特别的历史任务——领导着抵抗美国奴役欧洲的计划，并勇敢地团结起来揭露美帝国主义在各国国内的帮手，——落到了共产党的肩上。同时共产党必须支持一切为防止其祖国被侵害，为反对外国资本奴役祖国，并为维护其国家主权而斗争的真正的爱国主义分子。共产党在团结一切反法西斯与爱好自由的力量，进行反对美国奴役欧洲之新的扩张主义计划的斗争时，必须成为领导力量。
    必须记住，帝国主义发动新战争的愿望，与组织这一战争的可能性之间，存在着极大的距离。全世界各族人民都不要战争。
    现在工人阶级的主要危险，是在于过低估计自己的力量与过高估计敌人的力量。
    如果共产党坚持他们的立场，保卫巩固的和平、人民的民主、国家的主权和他们国家的自由与独立，如果他们在反对经济上与政治上奴役他们国家之企图的斗争中，懂得如何领导一切准备保卫光荣的事业和民族的独立的力量的话，那么任何奴役欧洲的计划都不可能实现。
