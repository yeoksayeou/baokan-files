　　Maintaining Contact with the Masses is the Most Important Quality of a Party Leader

　　The great founders and leaders of the Bolshevik Party—Lenin and Stalin—always attached great importance to the Party's connection with the masses and always cared about expanding and consolidating this connection. Our Party cannot be separated from the people. The Party is linked to millions of workers by many strong and unbreakable chains, and its strength and invincibility lie here. Comrade Stalin said: "The Bolsheviks are powerful because they maintain contact with their mother, the masses, who gave birth to, raised, and educated them. And as long as they maintain contact with their mother, the people, they have every possibility to remain invincible. This is the key to the invincibility of Bolshevik leadership."
　　The entire history of our Party illustrates that the Bolsheviks are good at organizing hundreds of millions of people, at uniting the masses, at becoming one with them, and at making them follow themselves. During the days of the Patriotic War, "the Party became even closer to the people, and its connection with the broad masses of working people became even closer." (Stalin)
　　The Bolshevik Party enjoys great love, boundless prestige, and trust among the people because the working people are deeply convinced by their own life experiences of the correctness of the Party's policies, that the Bolsheviks have no interests other than the interests of the people, and no purpose other than the noble purpose of fighting for the happiness of the working people. In our country, two great forces—the people and communism—have merged into one. The Soviet social system is uniting the Soviet people into a common collective, creating an atmosphere of complete mutual trust and mutual understanding between the Party and the people.
　　The Party called on the working people to accelerate the restoration and development of industry, and the working class responded to this call with a powerful competition to greet the 30th anniversary of the Great October Revolution by completing the industrial plan ahead of schedule. The Party called on the Soviet peasants to fight for the fastest possible increase in agriculture and for the abundance of food in the country, and the collective farmers responded to this call with a mass march for high yields.
　　The main responsibility of Party organizations is to stimulate this labor enthusiasm of the masses and guide this enthusiasm to complete the specific tasks of economic and cultural construction.
　　The art of leadership is an important thing. Leadership—this does not mean sitting in the office and writing instructions. Leadership—this means motivating broad strata of people and leading them to successfully complete the tasks set by the Party. Constant connection with the masses, with the people, being good at not only educating the masses but also at learning from the masses—this is the foundation of Bolshevik leadership.
　　Comrade Stalin taught that for correct leadership, the experience of the leaders alone is not enough; this experience is insufficient. In order to handle things correctly, leaders should supplement themselves with the experience of the masses, the experience of ordinary Party members, and the experience of the working people.
　　At the February-March Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1937, Comrade Stalin gave an example of how the Central Committee cherished the experience of ordinary people and how carefully it listened to their suggestions. After drawing the attention of the participants in the plenary session to the resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union on increasing coal production in the Donbass, Comrade Stalin said: "This resolution of the Central Committee and the Council of People's Commissars—which has been recognized by all our comrades as correct and even famous—was suggested to us by ordinary people at the grassroots level."
　　A Party leader—a secretary of a state committee, a city committee, a district committee, or a primary Party organization—if he is willing to practically and Bolshevikly guide things, he should often listen to the opinions of ordinary staff members, talk with them, and consider their wealth of practical experience.
　　The following fact also illustrates that this is of decisive importance. An ordinary Party member and Stakhanovite worker, Matrosov, who was a heeling worker at the "Paris Commune" factory, proposed to formulate a plan for popularizing the Stakhanov labor method, so that within a certain period of time, all workers would complete and exceed the production quota without exception. The Party organization of the factory supported Comrade Matrosov's initiative. The Moscow Party Committee passed a resolution on popularizing the experience of the bootmakers to other industrial sectors. Thus, a new mass movement to improve labor productivity, which is now widespread throughout the country, began.
　　This is why it is necessary to listen to the opinions of ordinary staff members and always vigorously support their initiative.
　　Comrade Stalin also taught that organizing the implementation of resolutions is the most important condition for correct leadership. But to do this, it is impossible without the direct help of the masses. What does it actually mean to organize the implementation of resolutions? This means turning the ideas and significance of the resolution into the consciousness of the workers, motivating them to successfully complete the resolution, ensuring the vanguard role of Party members in all policies, developing organizational and political work among the masses, and unfolding competition and the promotion of advanced experience. Without the help of the masses, even the inspection of the implementation of resolutions is also impossible.
　　The Bolshevik Party bases its leadership of the masses on complete mutual trust and mutual understanding. Bolshevism and administrative orders are incompatible. The Party has always resolutely fought against various manifestations of arrogance and complacency on the part of Party members, simple administrative orders, and bureaucratic leadership methods. In this regard, the resolution of the February Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) is a serious warning. The resolution said: "It is intolerable to replace the unremitting, systematic organizational work and cadre education in collective farms with such shortcomings as the frequent replacement of collective farm chairmen by administrative orders and the destruction of internal democracy in collective farms." The plenary session called on all Party organizations to further consolidate their connection with the masses.
　　Unfortunately, we still have some leaders who use their positions to bully, are arrogant and complacent, are divorced from the masses, and do not listen to the opinions of ordinary Party members, workers, and collective farmers. Of course, things cannot move forward with these leaders.
　　Comrade Shkoda served as the Party Committee Secretary of the Kalavsk District in the Omsk Oblast. He was so obsessed with administrative orders that he was not only divorced from non-Party activists but also from Communist Party members. Comrade Shkoda came to the collective farm and to the machine tractor station—he did not talk to the leaders and ordinary staff members, nor did he listen to their opinions. He made a lot of noise, regardless of the truth, and then he went elsewhere. It is not difficult to imagine what results this method can achieve. As a result, not only ordinary Party members, but also the secretaries of Party organizations, tried their best to avoid going to the District Committee Secretary. The Party's political work in the district was extremely weak, and the district's economic work was the most backward in the oblast.
　　A Bolshevik leader should have frequent communication and contact with the masses and rely on them in all his activities. However, the Bolshevik's contact with the masses can never mean tailism. On the contrary, tailism, like administrative orders, is completely unrelated to the spirit and policies of Bolshevism.
　　Sometimes it happens that the leader of a Party organization seems to be connected with the masses on the surface, and he often stays among the workers and collective farmers. But when you look deeper, you find that this Party leader is not exploring the actual situation, and he avoids talking about sharp issues in his conversations with people.
　　Of course, the Bolsheviks do not need such "connection." A true leader does not tail the masses, but leads them to follow himself. He is first and foremost loyal to his relationship with the masses. He is not afraid to raise questions sharply, as long as the question is correct from the Party's point of view. If a worker or collective farmer is working poorly and has not completed the quota, it is the leader's responsibility to correct him, talk to him straightforwardly, and, if necessary, let everyone criticize him. This will only bring benefits. Both the bad work of the leader and the bad work of the led need to be criticized.
　　The Party builds its connection with the people on the basis of deeply educating the masses in the spirit of Lenin and Stalin's great ideas. The method of persuasion is the basic and main method in the Party's political work. This is why the Party requires every Party member to carry out encouragement and propaganda, and to explain the meaning of the Party's policies and decisions to the masses. The guide must set an example. The Chairman of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) instructed the plenary session that "the responsible leading staff of the district, state, border, and republic Party and Soviet organs must go to the collective farms, personally guide the political and Party organizational work, guide the seminars and meetings of the collective farms, and solve Party and political work in the primary Party organizations."
　　However, this extremely important instruction is not being implemented everywhere. In the Bryansk Oblast, many Party and Soviet staff members avoid doing political work in the collective farms. Some of them are even members of the lecture group, but they do not even fulfill this responsibility. Comrade Glebinnikov, the Vice Chairman of the Oblast Soviet Executive Committee, did not give a single report in the collective farm throughout the year.
　　He was in the Chiryatinsk and Vygonichsky Districts between April and May, but he did not speak to the collective farmers once. He said: "There is no time to give a report, it is time to sow."
　　Party and Soviet staff members should use all forms of connection with the workers. Personal contact with people has great significance here. This contact can often make people speak their minds well, accurately determine the mood of the masses, immediately answer the masses' inquiries, and educate them politically. Those bureaucratic leaders who try their best to avoid the workers deserve the sharpest condemnation. And some factory managers or leaders of Soviet organizations are difficult for ordinary people to meet. Similar non-Bolshevik practices cannot be tolerated.
　　Party organizations should make the best possible use of the organs of mass organizations—Soviets of Workers' Deputies, trade unions, Communist Youth League organizations, etc.—to consolidate their connection with the masses and improve their leadership over them. A Party leader who tries to do everything relying only on the strength of the Party organization and the strength of Party members, without attracting non-Party activists to participate in the work, is not a good leader. The art of Bolshevik leadership lies in organizing coordinated action and connection in the activities of all mass organizations of workers, leading them to complete these or those tasks.
　　Party organizations should always care about improving the work of local Soviets, trade unions, and Communist Youth League organizations, and must use all methods to consolidate them and educate their staff in the spirit of being responsible to the voters, to the people, and to the broad masses of working people.
　　The most important tool for connecting with the masses is the newspaper. It enables the Party to talk to the masses every day and every hour, and to turn the Party's ideas and policies into the property of millions of people. It is the responsibility of Party and Soviet staff members to actively participate in newspaper work. Unfortunately, many local staff members rarely do this.
　　Close and frequent connection with the people, being good at not only educating the masses but also at learning from the masses, being good at leading the masses and listening to their opinions—this is the most important quality of a Party leader, and this is the condition for correct Bolshevik leadership. Every leader of a Party organization, a Party committee, and every Party member should strictly abide by this instruction of Lenin and Stalin and be a true leader of the masses. The foundation of all our victories lies here. (Written by A. Gleybnev, translated by Qi Sheng from the July 15, 1947, issue of Pravda)

### 与群众连系是党的领导者最重要的品质

　　与群众连系是党的领导者最重要的品质
    布尔什维克党的伟大创立者与领袖——列宁和斯大林，总极度重视党与群众的连系，总关心这种连系的扩大与巩固。我们的党是不能同人民分离的。党是被许多坚固的不可破裂的链锁同千百万劳动者连系着，而它的力量，它的不可战胜性就在这里。斯大林同志说：“布尔什维克的所以强有力，就是因为他们与自己那生育、抚养和教育了他们的母亲即群众保持着连系。而只要是他们同自己的母亲即人民保持着连系，则他们就有一切可能依然是不可战胜的。布尔什维克领导之所以是不可战胜的，其关键就在这里。”
    我们党的全部历史说明着布尔什维克是善于组织成百万的群众，善于团结群众，与他们打成一片，并使他们跟随自己。在祖国战争的日子里，“党同人民是更加亲密了，同广大的劳动群众的连系是更加密切了。”（斯大林）
    布尔什维克党在人民群众中间享有巨大的爱，无限的威信与信任，因为劳动人民根据自己的生活体验深信党的政策之正确，深信布尔什维克除了人民的利益以外，没有其他的利益，除了为劳动人民的幸福而斗争的崇高目的以外，没有其他的目的。在我们国内，两种伟大的力量——人民与共产主义已合而为一。苏维埃社会制度正把苏维埃人民结合成一个总的集体，创造着一种党与人民之间完全的相互信任与相互了解的氛围。
    党曾号召劳动者加速恢复与发展工业，于是工人阶级就以提前完成工业计划迎接伟大十月之三十周年的有力竞赛来回答这个号召。党曾号召苏维埃农民为最快的提高农业，为使国内粮食丰裕而斗争，于是集体农民对这一号召就回答以为高额收获的群众进军。
    激发群众的这种劳动热情，引导这种热情去完成经济与文化建设的具体任务——党组织的主要责任就是如此。
    领导的艺术是一件重要的事情。领导——这并不是说坐在办公室里写作指示。领导——这是说推动广大阶层的人们，带领他们去胜利地完成党所规定的任务。同群众，同人民的经常的连系，不仅善于教育群众，而且善于向群众学习——这就是布尔什维克领导的基础。
    斯大林同志教导说，为了正确的领导，只是领导者们的一种经验是不够的，这种经验是不充分的。为了正确的处理事情，领导者应该以群众的经验，以普通党员的经验，以劳动者的经验来补足自己。
    在一九三七年联共（布）中央委员会二、三月全会上，斯大林同志曾举例说明，中央委员会如何珍贵普通人们的经验，如何注意倾听他们的建议。在提起全会参加者注意联共（布）中央委员会与苏联人民委员会关于提高顿巴斯煤的产量的决议后，斯大林同志说：“中央委员会与人民委员会的这个决议——它已为我们全体同志所承认为正确的而且甚至是著名的决议——是由下层的普通人们给我们提示的。”
    党的领导者——州委的、市委的、区委的、基层党组织的书记——如果他愿意实际地布尔什维克地指导事情，他就应该经常倾听普通工作人员的意见，同他们拉话，考虑他们大量的实际经验。
    下述事实也说明这一点是有着如何决定性的重要。有一个普通党员斯塔哈诺夫运动者马特洛索夫，他是“巴黎公社”工厂的切皮工人，他曾提议制订普及斯塔哈诺夫劳动方法的计划，以便在一定时期内全体工人无例外地完成并超过生产定额。工厂的党组织支持马特洛索夫同志的创议。莫斯科党委会通过了关于普及靴匠的经验到其他工业部门的决议。于是一个在目前普遍全国的、为提高劳动生产率的新的群众运动开始了。
    这就是为什么要倾听普通工作人员的意见，随时大力支持他们的主动创议的道理。
    斯大林同志又教导说，组织决议的执行，乃是正确领导的最重要的条件。但是要做到这一点，没有群众的直接帮助是不可能的。组织决议的执行实际上是什么意思呢？这就是说，把决议的思想与意义变成劳动者的意识，推动他们去胜利地完成这个决议，保证一切政策中党员的先锋作用，发展群众中的组织的与政治的工作，展开竞赛与先进经验的宣传。没有群众的帮助，连组织决议的检查，同样也是不可能的。
    布尔什维克党把自己对群众的领导，建立在完全的相互信任与相互了解的基础上，布尔什维克主义与行政命令是水火不相容的。党始终坚决地与党员傲慢自大的各种表现，简单的行政命令，办公室官僚主义的领导方法作斗争。在这一点上，联共（布）中央委员会二月全会的决议是一个严重的警告。决议说：“不能容忍这样的一些缺点，如象：以行政命令集体农场主席的经常更换，集体农场内部民主的破坏等，来代替集体农场中不屈不挠的系统的组织工作和干部教育。”全会要求党的一切组织更加巩固同群众的连系。
    遗憾的是，我们还有这样的一些领导者，他们借自己的职位作威作福，高傲自大，脱离群众，不倾听普通党员、工人、集体农民们的意见。当然，在这些领导者那里，事情是不能推向前进的。
    什科达同志担任着奥木斯克州卡拉夫斯克区的党委书记。他一直迷恋于行政命令，以致他不仅脱离了非党的积极分子，而且也脱离了共产党员。什科达同志来到集体农场，来到机器托拉机站——他不去同领导者们，同普通的工作人员谈论，不倾听他们的意见。他大吵大闹，而不管事情真相怎样，他又到别处去了。这种方法能达到什么结果，是不难想象的。结果是不仅普通党员们，就是党组织的书记，都极力避免到区委书记那里去。区内党的政治工作是异常的薄弱，该区的经济工作在州内也是最落后的。
    布尔什维主义的领导者，应该同群众有经常的交往与接触，在其一切活动中凭借他们。然而布尔什维克同群众的接触从来不能意味着尾巴主义。相反地，尾巴主义，同行政命令一样，与布尔什维主义的精神与政策毫不相干。
    有时会有这样的事：党组织的领导者表面上似乎同群众是有连系的，他常在工人与集体农民中间。可是你一往深处看——就发现这位党的领导者并不在探究事情的实际，他在同人们的谈话中逃避谈论尖锐的问题。
    当然，布尔什维克不需要这样的“连系”。真正的领导者并不做群众的尾巴，而是领导他们跟着自己。他首先忠实于同群众的关系。他不害怕尖锐地提出问题，只要这问题照党的观点是正确的。如果工人或者集体农民工作很坏，没有完成规定，领导者的责任就在于改正他，率直地同他谈话，而如果需要时——就由大家来批评他。这只会带来益处。领导者的坏的工作，被领导者的坏的工作，都需要批评。
    党将其同人民的连系，建立在以列宁、斯大林的伟大思想的精神深刻教育群众的基础上。说服的方法，是党的政治工作中基本的与主要的方法。这就是党之所以要责成每个党员进行鼓励与宣传，向群众解释党的政策与决定之意义。引导者必须以身作则。联共（布）中央委员会主席向全会指示，“区的、州的、边疆的和共和国的党与苏维埃的机关负责领导的工作人员，必须到集体农场中去，亲自指导政治的与党组织的工作，指导集体农场的座谈会与会议，在党的基层组织中解决党的与政治的工作。”
    可是，并不是各地都在执行这个极端重要的指示。在布利安斯克州，许多党的与苏维埃的工作人员逃避做集体农场的政治工作。他们中有些人还算是讲演团中的人，可是，他们就连自己这个责任也不去尽。州苏维埃执委会副主席格列宾尼可夫同志终年不在集体农场做一次报告。
    四月和五月间他是在齐里亚廷斯克与维葛尼奇斯克区，但是他没有一次向集体农民讲话。他说：“没有时间做报告，应该播种了。”
    党的，苏维埃的工作人员，应该利用一切同劳动者连系的形式。在这里亲自与人们按触，是有巨大的意义的。这种接触常能很好地使人说出心里话，无误地确定群众的情绪，立即解答群众的询问，并在政治上教育他。那些极力躲开劳动者的有官僚习气的领导者，是值得最尖锐的谴责的。而另一些工场的管理人或苏维埃组织的领导者，普通的人科难以会见他们。不能容忍类似的这类非布尔什维克的实际。
    党的组织，应该尽可能地好好利用群众组织的机关——劳动者代表苏维埃、职工会、共产主义青年团组织等等，以巩固同群众的连系，以改善对他们的领导。企图仅仅依靠党组织的力量，党员的力量来做一切，而不吸引非党的积极分子参加工作的那种党的领导者，是不好的。布尔什维克领导的艺术在于劳动者的一切群众组织的活动中，组织配合行动与连系，领导他们，去完成这些或那些任务。
    党的组织应该经常关心改善地方苏维埃的、职工会的、共产青年团组织的工必须用一切方法巩固它们，以对选民、对人民、对广大劳动群众负责的精神教育它们的工作人员。
    同群众连系的最重要的工具是报纸。它使党能够每日每时地去同群众谈话，把党的思想与政策变为成百万群众的财产。党的与苏维埃的工作人员之责任，就是积极地参加报纸工作。可惜很多地方工作人员很少这样做。
    同人民密切的经常的连系，善于不仅教育群众，而且向群众学习，善于领导群众并倾听他们的意见——党的领导者之最重要的品质，就是如此，正确的布尔什维克之领导的条件，就是如此。每一个党组织的、党委员会的领导者，每一个党员，都应该严格地遵守这个列宁、斯大林的指示，做群众的真正领袖。我们一切胜利的基础，就在这里。（Ａ·葛莱普涅夫作，齐生译自一九四七年七月十五日真理报）
