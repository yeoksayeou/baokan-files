Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: TASS reports: From the 22nd to the 27th of last month, the Political and Security Committee of the UN General Assembly discussed the Soviet Union's proposal against propaganda for a new war and war-mongers. Despite the desperate resistance of the United States and its followers to reject the original Soviet proposal, it unanimously passed a resolution on the 27th condemning war propaganda and incitement to a new war. This marks a huge victory for the Soviet Union's peace policy, bringing to an end a long period of intense political struggle on this issue. The resolution is as follows: The United Nations General Assembly shall take the following actions: 1. Condemn all propaganda in any country that threatens and undermines peace. 2. Recommend that the governments of all member states of the United Nations take appropriate measures, in accordance with the goals and principles of the Charter, to promote friendly relations between countries and encourage the dissemination of all news aimed at expressing the desire of the people of all countries for peace. 3. This resolution shall be submitted to the United Nations Conference on Freedom of Information, to be held next March, to discuss implementation methods. Although this resolution is not the original Soviet text, but a so-called compromise proposal put forward by Australia, Canada, and France, it still includes the basic demands of the Soviet Union that the people of the world pay attention to and condemn the activities of war-mongers. Therefore, the Soviet representative, after pointing out that it was not specific enough and incomplete, voted in favor. The majority of countries in the committee, under the manipulation of the United States, refused to take effective measures proposed by the Soviet Union to stop war-mongers, but they did not dare to oppose the evil propaganda condemning a new war. They clearly knew that the people of the world, who were indignant and vigilant at the war cries of reactionary elements, were expecting the condemnation of war-mongers. Therefore, even the U.S. delegation, which was stubbornly opposed to condemning war propaganda, was forced to vote in favor. Not only that, but when the original Soviet proposal was put to a vote, it could also be seen that the defeat belonged to the reactionaries. For example, when voting on the first point of the Soviet proposal revised by Poland, the United States, although it knew that this proposal was exactly the same as the first point of the joint proposal of Australia, Canada, and France, still incited its followers to vote against it. As a result, the Soviet proposal still received 18 votes in favor, including the United Kingdom, Cuba, Afghanistan, Egypt, and Syria. 14 countries abstained from voting because they were unwilling to follow the United States, and two countries refused to vote. The negative votes led by the United States only amounted to 23, not exceeding half. Under this atmosphere, British representative McNair also had to declare that he had "some differences" with his friend Austin (US representative).

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: Moscow News: The diplomatic observer of the Izvestia wrote when discussing the UN General Assembly: The adoption of the resolution condemning propaganda for a new war by the Political and Security Committee is a great moral victory for all peace-loving people and a defeat for the war-mongers and their accomplices. Even the United Press had to admit that the United States was forced to endorse a bill it opposed; otherwise, the United States would suffer a complete defeat. The observer further pointed out: The basic factors that undermine peace and tranquility and at the same time strengthen bellicose tendencies are the arms race and the fact that the troops of one country remain in the territory of another country two years after the end of the war. He said: It is enough to recall the situation in Greece and China, where foreign troops help to create bloodshed and devastating wars. The observer concluded that after winning a moral victory over the war-mongers, the world's democratic forces must use their growing influence to force some countries to implement the resolutions of the first UN General Assembly to ensure peace and security for all countries.

    苏联和平政策巨大胜利
    联大政治安全委员会决议
    谴责战争宣传
    【新华社陕北二日电】据塔斯社报导：上月二十二日起至二十七日止，联大政治安全小组委员会，讨论苏联所提反对新战争宣传及战争贩子一案，尽管美国及其附庸拼命抵抗，将苏联原案否决；但仍于二十七日一致通过了谴责战争宣传及煽动新战争的决议。这标志着苏联和平政策的巨大胜利，使在这一问题上长时间以来紧张的政治斗争告一结束。该决议案如下：联合国大会应采取下述行动：一、谴责任何国家内足以威胁与破坏和平的一切宣传。二、建议联合国各会员国政府，采取适当措施，根据宪章的目标与原则，以促进各国间的友好关系，并鼓励传布一切旨在表现各国人民争取和平愿望之新闻。三、本决议提交明年三月将举行的联合国新闻自由会议，讨论实施方法。这个决议案虽然不是苏联的原文，而是澳、加、法三国提出来的所谓折衷案，但仍旧包括了苏联要求全世界人民注意及谴责战争贩子活动底基本主张。因此，苏联代表在指明其不够具体和不彻底之后，投了赞成票。委员会中大多数的国家，在美国操纵之下拒绝苏联所提制止战争贩子的有效措施，但也不敢反对谴责新战争的罪恶宣传，他们显然知道，对反动分子的战争叫嚣感到愤慨和警觉的全世界人民，都正期望着谴责战争贩子。所以连顽固到反对谴责战争宣传的美国代表团，也被迫不得不投票赞成。不仅如此，当苏联原案提付表决时，亦可看出失败属于反动派。例如在表决波兰修正后的苏联建议案第一点时，美国虽然明知这一议案和澳、加、法联合提案的第一点是一模一样，却仍鼓动他的附庸投反对票，结果，苏联的建议仍有十八国赞成，其中包括英国、古巴、阿富汉、埃及和叙利亚等国，十四国因不愿跟随美国而放弃投票，两国则拒绝投票。以美国为首的反对票，只有二十三国，没有超过半数。在这种气氛下，英代表麦克纳尔亦不得不宣称：他与他的朋友奥斯汀（美代表）“多少有些分歧。”
    【新华社陕北三日电】莫斯科讯：消息报外交观察家论联大时写道：政治安全委员会通过谴责新战争宣传的决议，是一切拥护和平的人们之伟大的道义上的胜利，并击败了战争贩子及其帮凶。甚至合众社也不得不承认：美国被迫赞成它所反对的议案；不然，美国便将遭受完全失败。观察家进而指出：破坏和平与安宁同时并加强了好战病的基本因素，是军备竞赛和在大战结束两年后一国军队仍驻留于别国的领土。他说：现在回忆一下希腊与中国的情形就够了，在那里，外国军队帮助制造流血惨剧和毁灭性的战争。观察家结论力称：在对战争贩子赢得道义上胜利之后，世界民主力量必须利用其日益增长的影响，迫使若干国家实现第一届联大决议，以确保各国之和平与安全。
