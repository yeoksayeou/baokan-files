[Report from our newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, 13th] Puyang County held an Anlan Conference to summarize river management and commend role models. On October 22nd, Puyang County convened the Anlan Conference for flood prevention and anti-Chiang activities, attended by fifty heroes who contributed to the Yellow River management. In the afternoon, the conference began with a discussion session, where the model heroes first recounted their exemplary deeds and experiences in Yellow River management. Zhao Jinzeng from Zhao'anzhuang in the Third District spoke first. After the higher authorities proposed flood prevention and dike protection, he immediately volunteered to go to the dike. He organized flood prevention materials and repaired the water gullies and wave nests on the dikes for every five flood prevention houses and ten flood prevention personnel, and rammed the dikes solid with pounders after rain. He did not return home for more than two months. When five flood prevention personnel from Wangmaqiao were killed by secret agents on the night of August 30th, it caused considerable panic among the nearby flood prevention personnel. He took the lead in night patrols and anti-espionage activities, stabilizing everyone's morale. During a night patrol, they encountered three secret agents with guns. They bravely seized the agents' weapons, captured the three agents, and handed them over to the district headquarters. Zhang Mingchao, a militia hero from Chengjiao Village in the First District, was a model during the dike restoration. During flood prevention, he served as a militia platoon leader. Despite suffering from eye disease, he still carried a machine gun and led the militia to patrol the ten-mile dike section every night. During the day, he also took the lead in fetching water and building mud houses with the military dependents. Although he lived in a boat house that could not shelter from the rain, his morale remained high. He once discovered three quilts and more than three zhang of white cloth from a fleeing landlord and handed them over to the higher authorities. Ji Zhuang in the Sixth District is a village by the river. Wang Jianke is a veteran pounder. During the dike restoration, although he was running a stall doing business, he didn't even bother to collect the debts people owed him and immediately joined the dike restoration, leading the pounding. Three of the four pounding teams he led were marked with red. Zhao Jinming, the badger-catching hero, is a squad leader in the engineering team. There were many badgers and foxes on the dikes. Puyang County caught more than sixty of them, and he caught more than forty of them. Zhao Bingqian (the foreman), a carpenter hero who built boats, is from Liuyuan in the Second District. He is proactive in his work and can unite carpenters from all over. He actively builds boats and cherishes public property very much, using broken pieces of wood and outer panels whenever possible. The boats he builds are particularly easy to use, and the sailors are competing to sail the boats he built. The ironworker Zhao Xipeng is an even more outstanding hero. He is not only a good foreman who can unite ironworkers, but also created new methods for cutting iron rails, splitting steel plates, and assembling iron hammers, saving more than thirty kilograms of coal every day. The discussion session lasted until noon the next day. On the afternoon of the 23rd, the fifty model heroes elected fifteen representatives to attend the Anlan Stele Celebration Conference of the Repair and Defense Office, and another fifteen representatives to attend the district-wide Anlan Conference.
