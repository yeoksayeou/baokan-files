    [This newspaper's Lucheng dispatch] After three days of intensive tilling, He×zhen in the Third District tilled a total of 1,062.7 mu of land. During the movement, the slogan "Not only fast, but also good tilling" was put forward in a timely manner, making the autumn tilling movement a step further. At the beginning of the autumn tilling, it was discovered that some women only cared about speed and not quality. At this time, the leadership proposed: "Our tilling should not only be fast, but also good. Only by achieving these two points will we be publicly commended!" West Street also put forward the slogan: "The land should be dug well, everyone should tell their family." This overcame the phenomenon of only being fast but not good. The village originally planned to complete autumn tilling before September 19th. Judging from the development of the movement, it is certain that it can be completed ahead of schedule.

    不仅要垡快而且要垡好
    【本报潞城讯】三区合×镇，经过三天抢耕，全村共垡地一千零六十二亩七分，运动中并及时提出：“不但要垡快，而且要垡好”的口号，使秋耕运动更深入一步。在秋耕刚喧起来时，发现有些妇女光图快，不图好，这时领导上提出：“咱们垡地不但要快，同时要好，做到这两点，才广播表扬哩！”西街并提出：“地要镢的好，人人往家叫”的口号，经这样克服光快不好的现象。该村原计划九月十九前完成秋耕，从运动发展上看，定能争取提前完成。（潞城县联合办公室）
