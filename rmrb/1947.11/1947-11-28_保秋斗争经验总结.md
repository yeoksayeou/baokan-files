　　Summary of Baoqiu Struggle Experiences
　　Taihang Military Commission

　　Since September, Taihang, under slogans such as "Protecting the Autumn Harvest is Like Protecting Life," "Reap When the Crops are Eighty Percent Ripe," "Rather Eat a Little Less Than Lose the Whole Mouthful," and "Strike First," overcame the 麻痹 (paralysis), complacency and other thoughts of cadres and militiamen. After more than two months of fierce struggle for "Three Protections" and the distribution of autumn crops and land in seventeen border counties and cities, most areas have victoriously completed the task of protecting the autumn harvest and achieved great results: a total of 4,387 enemies were annihilated, including 1,555 killed or wounded, 181 enemy soldiers captured alive, 2,651 traitors and bullies eliminated, 5 strongholds seized, 7 blockhouses burned, and the following captured: 12 machine guns, 11 light cannons, 198 rifles, 7 pistols, 17 bayonets, 3 binoculars, 5,515 rounds of ammunition, 780 bombs, 6 boxes of shells, 1 box of explosives, 56 head of livestock, 548 shi of grain, 3 bicycles, and many other materials. In the rush to harvest and distribute autumn crops and land, statistics from only some areas show: over 52,000 mu of autumn grain crops were reaped, over 17,000 shi of autumn grain and 71 large carts were recovered, over 3,022,000 jin of cotton were reaped, 277 mu of land illegally seized by landlords was recovered (statistics from one county), 334 head of livestock were recovered, and over 27,000 mu of autumn fields and 2,700 mu of jujube orchards, as well as materials worth 30 million yuan, were distributed from traitors and bullies. In addition, in places like Yuci, Yuanshi, and Bo'ai, millions of jin of public and private grain were rushed away in the process of harvesting, distributing, and storing, and over 2,200 mu of wheat were rushed to be planted. From these achievements, the following experiences can be summarized:

　　1. Under the policy of "The enemy advances, we advance; the enemy doesn't advance, we still advance," combining the "Three Protections" struggle of striking first with the distribution of autumn crops and land, all forces were unified and concentrated, penetrating deep behind enemy lines. Military offensives and political offensives were carried out simultaneously, annihilating a large number of enemies, disrupting the ruling institutions and plundering deployments of Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's bandits, and launching a vigorous movement to distribute autumn crops and land. Since guerrilla warfare is fought to defend the interests of the masses, it must also meet the current economic demands of the masses for grain and land. In the political offensive, we publicized our victory in the counter-offensive and the land reform policy, resolving the masses' ideological concerns about distributing autumn crops and land, both organizing and educating the masses, and supporting the masses to dare to act boldly. Wherever the Yexian armed forces fought, they distributed land; armed turn-over teams and autumn harvest and land distribution shock brigades organized by Yuci, Taiyuan, Qi County, Xiuwu, Xinxiang, and Jixian, combined military and political power, and launched joint attacks behind enemy lines, which were powerful forms of striking at Chiang Kai-shek's, Yan Xishan's, traitors and bullies. There were also new innovations in tactics. The "Tiger Digging Heart" tactic of the Yexian, Xinxiang, and Yuci-Taiyuan-Qi Wu Gong teams, which dragged down the enemy's legs to cover the rush harvest; the joint operations of Gao, Yuan, and Zan and the border explosions of Jiaozuo, Yuci, Jingxing, and Anyang; and the small-scale annihilation battles of the Yuci-Taiyuan militia, all inflicted considerable damage on the enemy.

　　2. "One hand holding a gun, one hand distributing land and autumn crops," with poor and hired peasants as the backbone, vigorously and rapidly launched a guerrilla war to distribute land and rush the autumn harvest. The border counties all trained a large number of poor and hired peasants and organized them into Wu Gong teams and capture teams, clarifying the battle lines. Through speaking bitterness, settling accounts, calculating losses, classifying class status, and finding the root of misfortune, class consciousness was enlightened. Combined with the battalion soldiers and cadre teams, they fought back to their own areas and villages to carry out struggles. Because the movement was launched in border areas, guerrilla areas, and behind enemy lines, in the struggle to seize grain from the enemy, it was necessary to act vigorously and rapidly, relying on the poor and hired peasants to fight, distribute, and store quickly. Otherwise, small steps, following procedures, and not boldly letting go, a non-poor and hired peasant line of action is harmful.

　　3. Combination of labor and military: Different organizational forms were adopted according to different regions. In places where the enemy might temporarily seize grain and occupy land, mutual aid groups or teams were formed according to the villages and transfer groups where the masses were scattered and evacuated. The militia formed combat groups and reconnaissance groups to rush the harvest, led by cadres from the headquarters who were scattered. In areas where the enemy had the advantage and behind enemy lines, the masses were besieged, and the masses were rapidly mobilized to distribute land and autumn crops, distributing and storing as they fought. In border areas and areas close to the border, such as the Dongmashui area of the Sixth District of Anyang, a rush harvest headquarters was established, divided into production, combat, reconnaissance, elimination of traitors, transfer and other organizations, with men, women, old and young dividing the work and collectively rushing the harvest. For example, women and older children in Xiguzhuang reaped, younger children weeded, young adults transported, and the elderly threshed. However, rush harvest mutual aid groups must be voluntarily formed by the masses, so as not to fear that the harvested crops will not be divided fairly and dampen their enthusiasm. Mutual aid groups should be small and efficient; otherwise, large targets are easily attacked by the enemy.

　　In addition, the distribution of dividends should be specifically stipulated based on the distance from the enemy in the rushed harvest area to improve everyone's enthusiasm and launch a sharp rush harvest struggle with the enemy.

　　保秋斗争经验总结
    太行武委会
    太行从九月份起，在“保秋如保命”“庄稼熟八成就收”“宁叫少吃一口，不叫满口都丢”“先下手为强”等口号下，克服了干部、民兵的麻痹、自满等思想，十七个边沿县、市，经过两个多月的“三保”与分秋分田的猛烈斗争，大部地区已胜利完成保秋任务，获得了伟大成绩：计共歼敌四千三百八十七名，内毙伤敌一千五百五十五名，生俘匪军一百八十一名，奸霸二千六百五十一名，克据点五处，烧炮楼七座，缴获机枪十二挺、轻炮十一门、步枪一百九十八枝、手枪七枝、刺刀十七把、望远镜三付、子弹五千五百十五发、炸弹七百八十颗、炮弹六箱、炸药一箱、牲口五十六头、粮食五百四十八石、自行车三辆，其他物资甚多。在抢收分秋分田上，仅就部分地区统计：抢收秋禾五万二千余亩，夺回秋粮一万七千余石，又七十一大车，抢收棉花三百零二万二千余斤，夺回倒算地主土地二百七十七亩（一个县统计）、牲口三百三十四头，分奸霸地主的秋田二万七千余亩、枣田二千七百亩，及值价三千万元之物资。此外如榆次、元氏、博爱等地，在随收随分随藏中，抢运公私粮数百万斤，抢种麦二千二百余亩。从这些成绩的得来中，综合起来有如下经验：
    一、在“敌进我进，敌不进我亦进”、先下手为强的三保斗争与分秋分田相结合的方针下，统一集中了一切力量，深入敌后，军事进攻与政治攻势双管齐下，大量歼灭敌人，打乱蒋阎匪的统治机构与抢掠部署，开展了有力的分秋分田运动。游击战争既然是为保卫群众利益而战，同时又要满足群众当前要粮要地的经济要求。政攻中宣传了我反攻胜利及土改政策，解决了群众分秋分田思想顾虑，既组织与教育了群众，又给群众撑了腰，使群众大胆的干起来。邺县武装打到那，分到那，榆、太、祁、修武、新乡、汲县等组织的武装翻身队、保秋分田突击队，军政结合，联合出击敌后，都是打击蒋阎奸霸的有力形式。在战术上也有新创造，邺县、新乡及榆太祁武工队猛虎掏心，拖住敌腿，掩护抢收；高、元、赞的联合作战及焦作、榆次、井陉、安阳的联防边疆爆炸，榆、太民兵小型歼灭战等，都给敌人以相当大的杀伤。
    二、“一手持枪，一手分田分秋”，以贫雇为骨干，猛烈迅速开展分田抢秋游击战争。边地各县都大量集训了贫雇农民，以之为骨干整顿组织了武工队、捕捉队，明确阵营，以诉苦、算帐、算损失、划阶级、找祸根，启发阶级觉悟，结合营兵、干队，打回本区本村，开展斗争。因运动是开展在边沿区、游击区和敌后，在与敌抢粮斗争中，故要求动作猛烈迅速，依托贫雇快斗、快分、快藏。否则，小手小脚，按步就班，不大胆放手，非贫雇路线的作法是有害的。
    三、劳武结合：根据不同地区，采取不同组织形式。在敌暂时抢粮可能侵占的地方，按照群众分散撤退村和转移组，组成互助组或队，民兵组成战斗组、侦察组进行抢收，由指挥部干部分散领导。在敌优势区和敌后则是围困敌人，猛烈迅速发动群众分田分秋，随斗随收随分随藏。在边沿区和靠边沿区，如安阳之六区东麻水一带，设抢收指挥部，下分生产、作战、侦察、除奸、转移等组织，男女老少分工集体抢收。如：西故庄妇女、大儿童割，小儿童锄穗，青壮年运输，老年打场。但抢收互助组一定要是群众自愿结合，以免怕割回庄稼分不公而情绪低落。互助组要短小精干，否则，目标大易受敌袭击。
    此外，分红应根据抢收地区离敌远近而具体规定，以提高大家情绪，与敌展开尖锐的抢收斗争。
