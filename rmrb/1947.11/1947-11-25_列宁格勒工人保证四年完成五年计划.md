　　列宁格勒工人保证四年完成五年计划
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】莫斯科讯：列宁格勒产业工人，工程师，技师暨工厂职员，十九日发出告全苏产业工人书，呼吁争取以四年完成五年计划。内称：自从爱国战争结束以来，苏联人民在恢复与发展社会主义经济与文化一切部门的工作中，已获得了巨大的成就。当某些国家正日益接近经济危机，千万人民势将陷入饥馑之时，苏联工业的发展却蒸蒸日上，从事手工业的工人日见增多，劳动生产率日有改进，物质福利日益提高。列宁格勒工人曾郑重保证十一月七日以前完成一九四七年全年生产计划书，我们已信守不渝地实现了。鉴于我们所获得的成就，并在估计我们的能力及可能性以后，我们保证提前在四年内完成战后斯大林五年计划。我们呼吁社会主义工业及运输业的一切工人，工程师，技师，领班与工厂职员，赞同我们的倡议，在全国范围内展开在四年中完成五年计划的社会主义竞赛。
