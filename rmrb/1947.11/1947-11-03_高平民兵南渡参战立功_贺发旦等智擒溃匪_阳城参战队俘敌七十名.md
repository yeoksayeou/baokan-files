    【Xinhua News Agency,豫陕 Front, 31st】The participation teams that crossed the river south with the counter-offensive army are vying to make contributions on the front lines. The Gaoping participation team held a merit-recording meeting during a lull in the fighting. Out of the entire team of 886 people, after comparison and evaluation, 56 heroes such as He Fadan and Zhu Mannv were selected. Before departing, they were determined not to return home until the task was completed. On the front line, each person often carried more than 80 catties. During the Tiemen battle, each person carried two boxes of grenades, marching in the heavy rain. After the grenades were delivered, they carried stretchers. They rescued the wounded under enemy fire. During the attack on the South Gate of Luoyang, Duan Chunhe of the county rescued the wounded under heavy enemy fire. He Fadan, who was discharged from the army due to injury during the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, took care of the wounded in the participation team with meticulous care this time, taking off his clothes to cover the wounded. Whenever he had time, he would help the cooking class carry water and cook, and he bravely and resourcefully captured scattered enemies. During the Lingbao battle, a group of defeated enemy soldiers rushed to the residence of the participation team. Company Commander Jin Fulin cleverly captured four. He Fadan searched out three enemies in a cave. Zhu Mannv observed mass discipline particularly well, not violating it herself and persuading others not to violate it. Most of these heroes were emancipated households in the liberated areas. He Fadan's family was allocated four mu of land. Zhu Mannv was a cotton ginning worker who sold her sister and starved her father to death during the great famine. She only turned herself over after the People's Liberation Army arrived in 1945. The Yangcheng participation team also captured 70 enemies alive in the Tiemen battle. When the defeated enemy approached @jia Village, dozens of members of the participation team stationed in the village rushed out with stretcher poles and hand grenades, surrounding the enemy. All the enemies laid down their weapons, and a lot of spoils were seized.

    高平民兵南渡参战立功
    贺发旦等智擒溃匪
    阳城参战队俘敌七十名
    【新华社豫陕前线卅一日电】随反攻大军南渡的参战队，在火线上争相立功。高平参战队曾于战斗间隙中举行记功会，全队共八百八十六人，经比较评定，评出功臣贺发旦、朱蛮女等五十六人。出发前他们就抱着不完成任务不回家的决心。在前线上每人经常负担八十斤以上。铁门战斗中每人担负两箱手榴弹，在大雨中行进。手榴弹送到后又抬担架。他们在敌人炮火下抢救伤员，攻击洛阳南关时，该县段春和就在敌人密集炮火下抢出伤员。在抗战中因负伤退伍的贺发旦此次在参战队中照拂伤员无微不至，把自己的衣服脱给伤员盖，有空就帮助炊事班担水作饭，并英勇机智捉拿散敌。灵宝战斗中敌溃兵一股冲到参战队驻地，中队长金福林即机智的捉住四个。贺发旦一人在窑洞里搜出三个敌人，朱蛮女遵守群众纪律特别好，自己不犯，而且劝人不犯。这些功臣大部是解放区的翻身户，贺发旦家里分了四亩地。朱蛮女是一个弹花工人，大灾荒时卖了姐姐，饿死了父亲，四五年解放军到了才翻了身。阳城参战队在铁门战斗中也活捉了敌人七十名，当溃敌边至＠家庄时，驻在该村的参战队数十人就拿着担架杆子同手榴弹，一涌而出将敌包围，敌人全数放下武器，缴获了许多胜利品。
