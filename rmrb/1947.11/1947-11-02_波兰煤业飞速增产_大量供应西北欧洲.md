Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th. Warsaw dispatch: Poland's post-war coal industry has rapidly increased production and now ranks first among all continental European countries except the Soviet Union (Agence France-Presse), and is supplying large quantities of coal to the countries of Northwestern Europe, which are suffering from a severe coal shortage. According to Polish Coal Industry Administration Director Topolski on the 26th, coal production reached 42 million tons in the first nine months of this year, exceeding the plan by 1.7 percent. Last year's total was 47 million tons, and the year before that it was 20 million tons. Since 1945, coal exports have increased threefold, and will reach 18.5 million tons this year. Productivity has also been greatly improved. In 1945, the daily output per miner was 897 kilograms, but this year it has reached 1,225 kilograms. This amazing development is the result of increased mechanization of coal mines and the enthusiastic participation of miners in revolutionary competitions. More than 80 percent of the workers involved in the competition wave exceeded the plan.
