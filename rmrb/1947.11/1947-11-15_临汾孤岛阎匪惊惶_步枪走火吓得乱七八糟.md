Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 13th. After our army captured Jixian and Xiangning, Yan's troops in Linfen were utterly terrified. On a certain day in late October, a member of Yan's "Security Police Team" guarding Ludao Village on the west bank of the Fen River had a rifle misfire. The Yan troops in the team immediately thought the Liberation Army had arrived, and more than a hundred people scrambled to the Fen River to escape, grabbing the "concealed river rope" (a long rope running across the river) to swim across. At this time, the Yan troops on the east bank heard the commotion on the west bank and, fearing that the Liberation Army would follow, hurriedly cut the "concealed river rope," causing all the hundred-odd Yan troops drifting in the middle of the river to drown. The Yan troops in the city were also extremely panicked, forcing residents over the age of thirteen to urgently dig trenches. Since October 28th, they have also demolished all the civilian houses and temples within three li around the city, leaving thousands of residents homeless.

　　临汾孤岛阎匪惊惶
  　步枪走火吓得乱七八糟
    【新华社晋绥十三日电】我军攻克吉县、乡宁后，临汾阎匪丧魂落魄。上月下旬某日，据守汾河西岸芦道村之阎记“保警队”一队员步枪走火，该队阎匪即以为解放军来到，百余人争扑汾河逃命，抓住“瞒河绳”（贯通河两岸的长绳）泅水渡河。此时东岸阎匪闻西岸骚动，亦生怕解放军跟踪而过，急忙将“瞒河绳”割断，致漂至中流之百余阎匪全部溺毙。城内阎匪亦惊惶万状，迫令十三岁以上之居民紧急挖掘战壕。自十月二十八日起，又将城周三里内之民房庙宇全部拆平，致千万居民无家可归。
