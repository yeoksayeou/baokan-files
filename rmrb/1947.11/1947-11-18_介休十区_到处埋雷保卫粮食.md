　　Jiexiu Tenth District
    Landmines Everywhere to Protect Grain
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 16th] Since the Zhang Ximan combat team initiated the explosive grain protection struggle in Shangliang, the tenth district of Jiexiu has launched a full-scale explosive movement. From October 20th to November 3rd, within two weeks, they killed or wounded 23 Yan bandit battalion commanders and lower ranks, protecting the grain. Starting on October 21st and 22nd, the Yan bandits' 219th and 218th regiments of the 73rd Division twice set out for Shangliang Village and were blown up by the Zhang Ximan combat team in coordination with the militia of Shangliang, Goukou, and other villages, wounding six enemy soldiers. This victory promoted the use of explosives to protect grain, and the masses laid landmines everywhere. On October 28th, more than 70 bandits from the police brigade set out again for Shangliang Village. Zhang Ximan and Liu Pingshan and others used landmines to kill or wound nine bandits. On November 1st, the entire 73rd Division of the Yan bandits set out to seize grain in the upper Banshan area of the first district. While passing through the mountain road outside Huajia Kiln Village, they triggered a landmine that killed the battalion commander and his horse, and wounded one special agent. On October 25th, a unit of Yan bandits from Zhanglan, in coordination with the bandits' "Struggle Group," disturbed Maici Village and triggered a landmine, killing one and wounding one. On the same day, Yan bandits who set out to seize grain in Xialiang Village also stepped on two landmines, killing or wounding three. In addition, on October 24th, bandits harassing Shanzhuang Village were also killed by a mine.
