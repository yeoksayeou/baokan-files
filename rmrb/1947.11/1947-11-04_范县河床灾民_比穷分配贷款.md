[This dispatch from the Ji-Lu-Yu (Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan) Border Region reports:] In Fanxian County, disaster victims in the riverbed area are comparing their poverty to allocate loans. After the disaster victims in the riverbed area of the Second District of the county received a loan of ten million yuan from the government, they distributed it according to the spirit of the masses, "filling the poor and supplementing the poor," and let the poor peasants evaluate it freely. For example, in Tiemiao Village, when poor peasants compared their poverty, Li Han said: "I am forty-nine years old this year, with a family of four. Before the land reform, I had 1.4 mu of land and worked as a hired laborer for fifteen years, suffering a lot. Although I was allocated more than 17 mu of land, the unharvested grain was flooded. I am the poorest!" Li Hanju's wife said: "Before the land reform, we had two mu of land, with a family of three. My husband joined the army, and I am blind. My daughter is young and we have no labor force. We are the poorest!" After a household-by-household comparison of poverty, evaluation committee members were selected to evaluate the grades. After evaluation, they were divided into three grades: The first grade was further divided into three classes: Li Han and Li Hanju and other three households were classified as special class, receiving 10,000 yuan per person; the middle class of three households, received 4,000 yuan per person; the third class of six households, received 3,000 yuan per person; the second grade of thirteen households, received 2,000 yuan per person; the third grade of four households, received 1,000 yuan per person, totaling 25 households and 108 people, with a total loan of 315,000 yuan, as sideline production capital. Combined with the relief, wheat seed loans of 518,000 yuan were issued, solving the difficulties of 44 households in planting wheat. After this loan and relief, the masses' enthusiasm for production is very high.

[This dispatch from the Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region reports:] In order to organize the loans for disaster victims along the river for production, the Ji-Lu-Yu Administrative Office issued instructions to various counties, mainly pointing out: After the Yellow River returned to its old course, the residents of the counties along the river suffered extremely severely, resulting in the displacement of hundreds of thousands of disaster victims. Although the loans raised by the Administrative Office under extremely difficult financial conditions cannot meet the demands of the masses, focusing on key areas and coordinating with production loans can solve some problems. All localities should learn from the Seventh District of Shouzhang County and mobilize production immediately after the funds are released. Yanhuo Village in the district used the relief funds and production loans as sideline production funds. So far, in just over a month, they have earned more than 50% in dividends. In addition to solving livelihood problems, they can also continuously expand the fund for reproduction. This example proves that the mass line of production for self-salvation is the most correct. Those who do not pay enough attention to this work or have not yet started should take action immediately.

    范县河床灾民
    比穷分配贷款
    【本报冀鲁豫一日电】范县河床灾民，大家比穷，分配贷款。该县二区河床灾民，得到政府千万元贷款后，即根据群众“填穷补穷”的精神发放，放手交贫农评议。如铁庙村，贫农比穷时，李汉会说：“我今年四十九了，人四口，土改前一亩四分地，当了十五年雇工，受过罪了，虽分了十七亩多地，没收粮食就淹了，我最穷！”李汉举妻说：“土改前地二亩，人三口，丈夫参军了，我瞎，俺妮小，无劳动力，俺最穷！”经过挨户比穷后，举出评议委员评议等级，经评议共分三级：第一级又划了三等，李汉会、李汉举等三户划到特等，每人领洋一万元；中等三户，每人领洋四千元；三等六户，每人三千元；第二级十三户，每人二千元；第三级四户，每人一千元，计救济二十五户，一○八口人，发放款三十一万五千元，作为副业生产资本，结合救济发放麦种贷款五十一万八千元，解决了四十四户种麦的困难，经这次贷款和救济，群众生产情绪很高。
    【本报冀鲁豫一日电】冀鲁豫行署，为把沿河灾民贷款有组织的进行生产，特向各县发出指示，主要指出：黄河归故后，沿河各县居民受灾极重，以致数十万灾民流离失所。行署在财政极端困难的条件下，筹措的贷款，虽然不能满足群众的要求，但有重点的发放，配合生产贷款，是能解决部分问题的。各地要向寿张七区学习，发款后立即动员生产。该区阎霍村将救济款与生产贷款，作为副业生产基金，迄今月余，已赚红利百分之五十以上，除解决生活问题外，尚能不断的扩大基金，进行再生产，从这实例，证明是群众路线的生产自救，是最正确的。对这一工作重视不够，或未着手进行的，均应马上行动起来。
