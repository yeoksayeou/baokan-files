　　Experience in Regularly Preparing Stretchers
    Regularly preparing stretchers is a step towards improving combat support work, a more rational use and saving of civilian manpower and financial resources, ensuring the rapid transfer of the wounded, and making stretcher bearers more proficient in their duties. Now, each column has been refitted with lightweight stretchers, whose task is to be responsible for transporting the wounded from the regimental dressing station to the column hospital. The stretcher bearers attached to each company are responsible for carrying the wounded from the front line to the regimental dressing station. In addition to carrying the wounded, when necessary, they can transport ammunition to the troops, transfer spoils of war, and clear enemy fortifications after the battle, as well as be responsible for guarding. Based on front-line experience, the following points need to be noted: (1) When mobilizing in the village, the task deadline must be explained, and there should be no deception. Before gathering, individuals should arrange their family life and personal affairs. Each person should bring a pair of shoes, socks, foot wraps, and a rice bag, and two to three people should bring a quilt. They should also bring their own cotton-padded coat. For safety, each stretcher team should preferably bring one or two short-handled iron shovels, ready to dig single-person trenches within the range of enemy artillery fire to prevent artillery fire casualties before accepting the task. Strong and sturdy people should be mobilized to be competent for this work. Village cadres, activists, and other backbone forces can play a leading role. In order to consolidate further, concentrated training is needed before sending them to the troops. The time can be determined according to the length of the service period and the transformation of the stretcher bearers' thinking. Generally, a month or so of training is sufficient. (2) Training content: First, conduct current affairs education, rectify thinking, and resolve ideological burdens, such as family production, fear of suffering hardships outside, fear of going to the front line, and fear of sacrifice; clarify that the soldiers on the front line are shedding blood for us, and we are sweating to protect our land for our own liberation, so that everyone goes to the front line sincerely and happily, washing away harmful thoughts such as following the crowd and doing short-term work. Cadres should deeply understand the specific ideological situation of each stretcher bearer, promptly combine it with practical problems, propose educational slogans, solve problems, and call on everyone to go to the front line to perform meritorious service. For example, the stretcher bearers of a certain unit once stipulated that carrying a wounded soldier three times on the front line would be recorded as one merit, which set off a challenge to establish and compete for the top position. County and district cadres should make great efforts to support them, so that each team member can guarantee to complete the task and return home gloriously. Let everyone fully deliberate and discuss how to deal with the rumors and sabotage of special agents and bad elements, how to deal with fleeing team members, how to control people with bad backgrounds or those who perform poorly in the village, and how activists can lead the masses who have not yet transformed their backward thinking. Second, learn professional skills: (1) Are airplanes and artillery really that scary? Such as the lighting bombs dropped by particularly loud airplanes at night and the strangely screaming bullets with red and green lights fired by the enemy in battle, the aimless firing of artillery shells, etc., the enemy uses these things to scare and shake our thinking. How should we deal with it after encountering it? (2) What to pay attention to during marching? Such as not falling behind, not smoking, not talking, how to contact each other before and after in night marching? What if contact is lost? Let everyone actually practice night marching, forced marching, emergency assembly, air defense, passing commands, and passing things before and after, how to rescue the wounded under artillery fire, etc. (3) Food, lodging, and hygiene. How can we ensure good food and lodging during marching and fighting? How can we reduce the number of people getting sick? Each district can mobilize one traditional Chinese medicine doctor to bring simple medicines with the stretcher team and regularly tell everyone some hygiene knowledge. (4) Study how to improve relations with the masses and take better care of the wounded. For example, the Guancheng stretcher team helped the masses with production, and the local masses helped them solve many difficulties, so violations of discipline were greatly reduced. The stretcher bearers of Unit × saved their own food money to buy sugar, chicken, and sesame cakes for the wounded, and voluntarily supported the army. Third, review again when sending them to the front line to participate in the war. Such as ideological problems, physique, age, and items brought. The local government should preferably organize a farewell. Each village and district should also frequently write letters to the front line, telling them about the local situation and the situation of their families, which will give the stretcher bearers great encouragement and comfort. As for the organizational structure, according to the experience of a certain unit, each squad has three lightweight stretchers, four people per stretcher, one squad leader, to replace the sick and carry large guns. A deputy squad leader and mutual aid group leader are selected from the stretcher bearers, each in charge of one stretcher. Each platoon has four squads. Several platoons form a company, and several companies form a battalion, which is not fixed. In principle, one district should have one company to maintain the original county and district leadership system. The company is equipped with a company commander, deputy company commander, political instructor, supply officer, and four odd-job personnel; the battalion is equipped with a battalion commander, deputy battalion commander, political instructor, administrator, and one accounting clerk each, one or two doctors, and ten odd-job personnel. The company and battalion have separate food and lodging, and the treatment is the same as that of soldiers.

　　常备担架经验
    担架常备化，是把战勤工作提高一步，是更合理使用与节省民力财力、保证伤员之迅速转运，使担架员更熟练自己的业务。现各纵队均已改装轻便担架，它的任务是负责团包扎所至纵队医院间之伤员运送，各连队内建制之担架兵，负责从火线上背到团包扎所，除抬伤员外，必要时可给部队运送弹药转运胜利品及破除战后敌人工事，并负责警卫。根据前方经验，有以下几点须注意者：（一）在村内动员时，要把任务期限说明，不要欺骗。集合前，个人应安插家庭生活和私事外，每人要带一双鞋子、袜子、包脚布、米粮袋，二至三人带被子一条，并将个人的大袄带来。为了安全，每付担架最好能带一或二短把铁铣，准备在敌人大炮射程内，接受任务前挖单人掩壕，以防炮火杀伤。要动员身强力壮的人才能胜任这个工作。村干积极分子等骨干力量，可起带头作用。为了能更巩固，在送部队前需集中整训，时间可根据服务期限之长短，担架员思想之转变来决定。一般整训月余即可。（二）整训内容：第一、进行时事教育，整顿思想，解决思想包袱，如家庭生产、怕出外受罪、怕上前线、怕牺牲等顾虑；明确前方战士为咱流血，咱们为自己翻身保田去流汗，使每个人真心诚意高高兴兴的上前方，清洗随大流打短工等有害思想。干部要深入了解每个担架员的具体思想情况，及时结合实际问题，提出教育口号，解决问题，号召大家前线上去立功。如某部担架曾规定上火线背三次伤员记一功，掀起挑战立擂打擂，县区干部要下大力撑腰，使每个队员能保证完成任务光荣回家。让大家充分酝酿讨论，如何对付特务及坏分子的造谣破坏，对逃亡的队员如何办，如何控制成份不好或村内表现不好的人，积极分子怎样才能带领尚未转变落后思想的群众等。第二、学习业务：（一）飞机大炮到底可怕不可怕？如怪声特别大之飞机夜晚放下来的照明弹及在战斗中敌人发射带红绿彩光之怪叫声子弹，无目标的发射大炮弹等，敌人利用这些东西来吓唬动摇我们的思想，遇到后应该怎样对付它？（二）行军中注意啥事？如不要掉队，不吸烟，不说话，夜行军中前后如何联络？如果万一失掉联络怎样办？让大家实际演习夜行军、急行军、紧急集合、防空、传口令、前后传事情，在炮火下如何抢救伤员等。（三）食宿卫生。怎样才能在行军中战斗中保证食宿搞好？怎样才能使大家少生病？每区可动员中医一人，带上简单药品，随担架，并经常给大家讲些卫生常识。（四）研究搞好群众关系，更好照顾伤员。如此次观城担架，由于帮助群众生产，当地群众帮助他们解决了很多困难，故违犯纪律现象也大大减少，×部担架员将自己菜金节省给伤员买糖、买鸡子、买烧饼吃，自动拥军。第三、送前方参战时再审查一次。如思想问题、体格、年龄、所带物品。地方上最好能组织欢送。各村区并应将地方上及其本人家庭等情形，常写信告诉前方，这样是会给担架员很大鼓励与安慰。至于编制问题，根据某部经验，每班轻便担架三付，每付四人，班长一人，替换病号和背大枪，在担架员中另选副班长及互助组长各一，每人掌握一付担架。每排四班。伙食以排为单位，设事务员一，班长与值星帮办，不设火夫。几个排一连，几个连一营不定，原则上一区一连为好，保持原县、区领导系统。连设正副连长、指导员、供给员、杂务人员四人；营设正副营长、教导员、管理员、会计事务员各一，医生一二人，杂务人员十人。连营另立伙食，待遇同战士。
