Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: Comprehensive reports: Due to the active interference of American imperialism and the frantic harassment of the de Gaulle elements, the French political situation is now extremely complex and tense. On the 23rd, Ramadier reduced his cabinet from twenty-five to thirteen, excluding all indecisive members from the cabinet and forming a "pure" right-wing Socialist Party, Popular Republican Movement, and Radical Party anti-communist and anti-democratic centralized cabinet. During the National Assembly debate on the 28th, French Communist Party member Duclos fiercely criticized, stating: "The policy of the Ramadier government has been manipulated and utilized by fascists and has helped the de Gaulle League. A major idea has troubled the government's headquarters, which is to welcome the desire of Washington to hand over the death certificate of French communism to the United States; however, you will never be able to establish this certificate!" Duclos vehemently denounced the de Gaulle movement as being composed of former Nazi henchmen and stated that accepting the Marshall Plan was tantamount to France being enslaved. With the connivance of the Socialist Party authorities, de Gaulle openly incited reactionaries to rise up on the 27th, demanding the dissolution of the current parliament in order to abolish the relatively democratic current new constitution. At the same time, various bribery and co-opting efforts are being carried out within the parliament, attempting to secure a two-thirds reactionary majority in the current parliament to carry out the crime of amending the constitution when "dissolution" fails. On the same afternoon, de Gaulle elements gathered a group of Parisian rogues and rascals to openly conduct anti-republican and anti-constitutional demonstrations. The Ramadier authorities turned a blind eye to this, but immediately aroused the angry protests of more than 15,000 workers in Paris. When the Ramadier authorities drove the police to interfere with the workers' protests, the angered demonstrators immediately clashed with the police, injuring fifty of the latter. On the 29th, following the statement of the French Communist Party on the 27th, the French General Confederation of Labor issued a call, demanding that the working class unite all its forces to defend the republic and democratic freedom and oppose the rebellious conspiracies of the de Gaulle elements.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: Paris dispatch: The Standing Committee of the Paris Regional Trade Union passed a resolution on the evening of the 1st, calling for uniting the strength of workers around the French General Confederation of Labor. The resolution demanded that all responsible persons in the trade union lead workers to rise up against the French government's participation in the economic group initiated by American imperialism and its attempts to undermine French independence. The resolution pointed out that the living standards of Parisian workers have seriously deteriorated, and workers' freedom is more threatened than before. French workers must be vigilant and wage a resolute struggle against the reactionary offensive of the reactionaries against workers' welfare. The resolution reiterated the need to struggle when the National Economic Council meets on November 12 to stipulate living standards and discuss price and wage issues, and demanded regular adjustments to wages and the immediate payment of a 20% temporary subsidy.

    巴黎工人示威抗议
    职工会号召工人团结
    【新华社陕北一日电】综合报导：由于美帝国主义的积极干涉，与戴高乐份子的疯狂骚扰，法国政局现已极度复杂而紧张。二十三日拉马第将其内阁由二十五人缩小为十三人，他将内阁中所有不坚决运动的阁员俱排除出阁，而成立了“清一色”的右派社会党、人民共和党和急进党的反共反民主的集权内阁。二十八日国民议会辩论中，法共议员杜克洛猛烈抨击称：“拉马第政府的政策，已为法西斯主义者所玩弄利用，并且帮助了戴高乐联盟。有一个主要的思想烦扰了政府的总部，那就是欢迎合华府心意把法国共产主义的死亡证交与美国；但是这件证书，你们是永远无法成立的！”杜克洛痛斥戴高乐运动是由前纳粹附庸所组成，并称接受马歇尔计划为法国之遭人奴役。在社会党当局的纵容下，戴高乐于二十七日公开煽动反动分子起来，要求解散现在的议会，以便废弃比较民主的现行新宪法。同时在议会内部则进行各种贿买拉拢，企图在“解散”不成时，在现议会内为其修改宪法的罪行争得三分之二的反动多数。当天下午戴高乐分子即纠合一群巴黎的流氓无赖公开进行反共和国反宪法的俯，拉马第当局对此竟熟视无睹，但立即引起巴黎一万五千余工人愤怒的抗议示威。当拉马当局驱使警察干涉工人的抗议时，激怒的示威者当即与警察发生冲突，使后者五十人受伤。二十九日法国总工会继二十七日法共之声明后，发出号召，要求工人阶级团结其全部力量保卫共和国与民主自由，反对戴高乐分子的谋叛阴谋。
    【新华社陕北三日电】巴黎讯：巴黎区职工会常务委员会一日晚通过决议，号召团结工人力量于法国总工会的周围。决议要求工会中一切负责人，领导工人起来反抗法国政府参加美帝国主义所发起的经济集团及破坏法国独立的企图。决议指出：巴黎工人的生活程度已严重恶化，工人的自由较以往更受到威胁。法国工人必须提高警惕，并与反动派对工人福利的反动攻势作坚决的斗争。决议重申将在十一月十二日国家经济委员会开会规定生活标准及讨论物价与工资问题时有作斗争之必要，并要求定期调整工资及立即付予百分之二十的临时补助金。
