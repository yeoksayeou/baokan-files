Xinhua News Agency, East China, 2nd: In the autumn political offensive of the military and civilians in Central Shandong, the Yimeng District has already won over 1,004 Chiang and puppet personnel to return and start anew. Most of the masses who were deceived and forced to flee to enemy-occupied areas have also returned. The work teams of Zhangqiu and Licheng counties even approached the outskirts of Jinan, holding mass meetings everywhere, writing slogans, and distributing leaflets. In just over ten days, they dismantled the Chiang and puppet regimes in more than twenty villages and established democratic governments. Under this influence, the citizens of Jinan are spreading news of the People's Liberation Army's great counter-offensive, and all kinds of anti-Chiang rumors are rampant. The masses in Yinan and Yizhong counties are registering the families of Chiang and puppet personnel, launching a "one letter saves a life" campaign, encouraging the families of Chiang and puppet personnel to persuade those who were coerced into joining the enemy to return home. At the same time, the masses are warning the principal offenders. Many of the warned Chiang and puppet personnel have released our military dependents and village cadres who were captured. The masses also built more than twenty large slogans on the mountain slopes on both sides of the Yi River with huge stones. Large slogans such as "The People's Liberation Army Treats Prisoners Well" were also made in the hilly areas of Southern Yi, which are clearly visible even on the Qing (Zhou) Lin (Yi) Highway.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 30th: Guerrilla warfare against Chiang bandits is underway in the suburbs of Yantai. On the morning of the 19th of this month, more than fifty Chiang bandits from Yantai, with eight large carts and a large number of small carts and livestock, went out to loot. They were ambushed by our Liu Li and Guo Youren with explosives in Zhu Yan Village, twenty-five miles southwest of Yantai City. The enemy fled in panic and was intercepted by our militia work teams, killing and wounding six enemy soldiers. The Chiang bandit village office personnel in Huangwu Village, eighteen miles south of Yantai, also fell into the people's militia minefield on the same day and were all killed. In addition: In order to launch an economic struggle against the enemy, on the 20th of this month, our Yantai Industry and Commerce Bureau and the Bank formed an armed economic work brigade to implement a material blockade against the enemy, strictly prohibiting daily necessities from flowing to enemy-occupied cities, and banning Chiang currency and American goods from flowing into the liberated areas.
