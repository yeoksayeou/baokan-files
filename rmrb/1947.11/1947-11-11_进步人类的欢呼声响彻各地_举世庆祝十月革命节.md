In Prague, Bratislava, and other places, there were also exhibitions on the history of the Soviet revolution and national construction. In Yugoslavia, as the chairman of the South Writers' Union, Andrejic, said at the celebration meeting: "Yugoslavia's social life in recent days has been preparing to celebrate the October Revolution anniversary. Because, firstly, the historical significance and socio-political achievements of the October Revolution have gathered the attention of all progressive humanity.

When Duclos, Gasan, and Marty delivered speeches, the crowd responded with thunderous applause, shouting "Strengthen French-Soviet friendship!"
