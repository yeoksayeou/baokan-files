　　[This dispatch from the Southern Shanxi Front, November 24th] The People's Liberation Army of Southern Shanxi has routed Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops attempting to reinforce Yuncheng, annihilating over 3,700 of them. On the 12th, Chiang's bandits scraped together over 10,000 troops from the Northwest battlefield, including the 1st Brigade, the 28th Brigade, the 247th Regiment of the 81st Brigade, the 1st Battalion of the 250th Regiment of the 84th Brigade, and the remnants of the bandit special agent Lei Wenqing's 3rd Battalion. Led by Zhong Song, commander of the 36th Division, and under the cover of aircraft, they crossed the river from Pinglu and advanced timidly towards the mountainous area of Dalangmiao, 25 li southeast of Yuncheng, attempting to lift the siege of Yuncheng. When the Chiang bandits realized they were surrounded, they desperately retreated south. Our army, braving wind and snow, heroically pursued and annihilated the Chiang bandits in segments until the evening of the 21st, when the bandits were completely routed. According to preliminary battle results, over 3,000 bandits, including the commander of the 2nd Regiment of the 1st Brigade, were killed or wounded, and over 700 officers and soldiers, including Yuan Daotang, battalion commander of the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Brigade, were captured. The spoils included one mortar, four 60mm guns, twelve heavy machine guns, thirty-two light machine guns, over two hundred rifles, sixteen American-style submachine guns, 16,000 rounds of ammunition, eight radio stations, and over sixty war horses.
    [This dispatch from the Southern Shanxi Front, November 24th] In the one-month siege of Yuncheng, the People's Liberation Army of Southern Shanxi killed or wounded over 2,000 of Chiang Kai-shek's and Yan Xishan's bandit troops. With the People's Liberation Army approaching the suburbs of Yuncheng, the Chiang bandits' 369th Regiment, the 250th Regiment (minus one battalion), and Yan Xishan's "5th Security Regiment" and "Political Guard Regiment," totaling several thousand officers and soldiers, continued to struggle stubbornly. Day and night, they launched successive, densely packed artillery barrages, forcing bandit troops to attack our army's positions, but they were all heroically repelled by our army. In the final week, our army began to sweep away outer strongholds, and the "fortress group defense system" boasted by the Chiang bandits was shattered. Among them, seven fortress groups numbered 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 10 were completely destroyed by us. In one month, in addition to killing or wounding 2,000 enemy troops, over 100 bandits were captured alive, and sixteen light machine guns, four small cannons, twenty-three rifles, and over 3,700 rounds of ammunition were seized.
    [This dispatch from the Southern Shanxi Front, November 24th] During the siege of Yuncheng, the medical units of the People's Liberation Army of Southern Shanxi launched a meritorious campaign of medical service and care for the soldiers. Shao Fangqi, security officer, and Liu Hanting, head of the medical administration section, took the lead in organizing blood transfusion teams, and Huang Jiwei, Du Zhigong, and others responded enthusiastically, volunteering to donate 5,900 cc of blood. Even Qi Zhongxin, the old cook班长 aged forty or fifty, said, "I am not afraid to sweat more. I will lead the cooking班 with the energy I had twelve years ago, think of more ways to improve the food, and cook whatever the wounded soldiers want to eat, whenever they want it." As soon as the battle began, comrades like Liu Hanting and Guo Wu worked tirelessly, actively treating the wounded. Doctor Chen Jirong worked at the operating table for so long that his legs and feet were swollen. Still, he worked tirelessly. Doctor Tian Yujiang performed surgery without eating for a whole day. Doctors Yang Wenlin, Shang Mingli, Qin Zhaotang, and others even forgot to sleep. The nurses stayed by the bedsides all night, and the patients said, "Comrades, you should rest!" But they refused, saying, "You shed blood, we only shed a little sweat, what does that matter!" Yang Wenlin, Chen Jirong, and five other comrades donated a total of 2,400 cc of blood to the wounded. Precisely because of their selfless spirit of serving the wounded in everything, the mortality rate of the wounded has been greatly reduced, and many seriously wounded soldiers have turned the corner. The wounded all said in unison, "As long as we are treated by them, we immediately feel better."

　　蒋匪北援运城被完全击溃
  　晋南我军歼匪三千
    围攻运城一月歼匪两千
    【本报晋南前线二十四日电】晋南人民解放军击溃北援运城之蒋匪，歼灭其三千七百余人。十二日，蒋匪从西北战场拼凑第一旅、第二十八旅、第八十一旅之二四七团、第八十四旅二五○团之第一营及匪特雷文清残部第三营等一万余人，由三十六师师长钟松率领，在飞机掩护下，从平陆渡河，向运城东南二十五里之大朗庙等山地畏缩前进，图解运城之围。待蒋匪发觉已陷我重围时，急回头南窜，我军不顾风雪，于十八日晚英勇追击，节节扭歼蒋匪，至二十一日晚，该匪即全部为我击溃。据初步战果：毙伤匪第一旅二团团长以下三千余人，俘第一旅三团三营营长原道堂以下官兵七百余人。缴获迫击炮一门，六○炮四门，重机枪十二挺，轻机枪三十二挺，步枪二百余支，美式手提机枪十六支，弹药一万六千发，电台八部，战马六十余匹。
    【本报晋南前线二十四日电】晋南人民解放军在围攻运城一月中，毙伤蒋阎匪二千余人。人民解放军兵临运城近郊，蒋匪三六九团、二五○团（缺一个营）及阎匪保五团、“政卫团”等数千官兵，还强作挣扎，昼夜相继，以密集炮火，逼迫匪众向我军阵地进袭，均被我军英勇击退。最后一周，我军即开始扫荡外围据点，为蒋匪所夸耀的“堡垒群防御体系”，即变得支离破碎。其中第一、三、四、五、七、八、十号堡群七处，完全被我摧毁。一月中除毙伤匪军两千外，生俘匪百余名，缴获轻机枪十六挺，小炮四门，步枪二十三支，弹药三千七百余发。
    【本报晋南前线二十四日电】在围困运城战役中，晋南人民解放军医疗所开展医务爱兵立功运动，保卫干事邵芳岐、医政科长刘韩庭等，首先发起组织输血队，即有黄继卫、杜志恭等纷纷响应，自报输血五千九百Ｃ．Ｃ．，连四五十岁的老炊事班长祁忠信也说：“我不怕多流汗，拿十二年前的劲头带领炊事班，多想办法把生活搞好，伤员愿吃什么就搞什么，随吃随作。”战斗一开始，刘韩庭、郭雾等同志，废寝忘食，积极医治伤员。陈吉荣医生长久在手术台边工作，把腿脚都站肿了。仍不疲倦地工作。田玉江医生施行手术，一天都未吃饭。杨文林、尚明礼、秦兆堂等医生，连睡觉都忘了。看护同志澈夜不离病床，病员都说：“同志你们休息一下吧！”但他们都不愿意，并说：“你们流了血，我们只流点汗，这算得什么！”杨文林、陈吉荣等七同志，共给伤员输血二千四百Ｃ．Ｃ．。正由于他们这种忘我的一切为伤员服务的精神，伤员死亡率已大大降低，不少重伤员转危为安，伤员也都异口同声的说：“只要经过他们的医疗，我们立即感到轻快。”
