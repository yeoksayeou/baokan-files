    [Reported from the Jilu Yu Front, 31st] Linze News: Under our powerful offensive, on October 17th, the Second Special Company of Liu Ruming's Fourth Pacification Zone, led by Company Commander Zhang Fuhai and Deputy Company Commander Xiao Shoutian, revolted in its entirety and has now safely arrived in a certain area of the Liberated Zone.
    [Reported from the Jilu Yu Front, 31st] The local armed forces of the Seventh Sub-district are actively working to protect the autumn harvest and wheat planting. From October 1st to 15th, in the area west of the Grand Canal alone, significant victories were achieved. On October 1st and 2nd, parts of the local armed forces of Ji(ning), Jia(xiang), Nan(wang) and other counties separately attacked the "Homecoming Corps" in the Ponan Jiabei area. Zhang Han's bandit unit fled upon hearing the news. Taking advantage of this, we advanced to the Wangqiao, Mangchangdian, and Liutun areas on the dawn of the 3rd to set up an ambush. However, the enemy had already fled to the outskirts of the city and dared not come out. We captured three scattered bandits and special agents from the 72nd Division alive. On the night of the same day, our unit advanced to the Shenlishan and Donglou areas, destroyed the puppet township government, captured eight "Homecoming Corps" members, including one团长, seized eight rifles, over 300 rounds of ammunition, and liberated four civilian laborers. On the 6th, an enemy battalion from Yuankou, north of Nanwang, attempted to plunder grain in the area west of Datun but was repelled by our unit. On the 13th, the Wugong Team of Kunshan First District repelled enemies plundering grain in the Xijinshan area, wounding five enemy soldiers. On the night of the 15th, our regiment, in coordination with local militia, carried out a mopping-up operation against the enemy entrenched in the northern part of Kunshan, recovering most of the area, capturing a stronghold, as well as strongholds in × village, Woniushan, Maowang and other locations. One company of the First Battalion of the 45th Regiment of the 12th Brigade of the 73rd Division was annihilated, killing 20 enemies and capturing 113 enemies (including 73 "Homecoming Corps" members), seizing dozens of rifles, six light machine guns, two small cannons, and over 3,000 rounds of ammunition. Currently, the local armed forces of our Seventh Sub-district are penetrating deep behind enemy lines, actively engaging in operations.
    [Reported from the Jilu Yu Front, 31st] The local armed forces and militia in various counties of Henan Province, in coordination with the main force, are actively launching attacks to protect the autumn harvest and wheat planting, achieving repeated victories. On September 2nd, the local armed forces of our Third Sub-district routed an enemy battalion of Chiang's troops passing through the Haozhuang and Xinyangmiao area, capturing more than 20 people alive, including the deputy company commander, wounding more than 70, seizing seven light machine guns, two Thompson submachine guns, eighteen rifles, 20,000 rounds of ammunition, eight howitzer shells, and burning three ammunition trucks. On September 7th, our Caoxian Brigade ambushed the enemy at Mengzhuang, wounding five enemies and seizing one rifle and over a hundred rounds of ammunition. On the same day, our local armed unit × destroyed 800 meters of the Longhai Railway between Minquan and Liuhe. On September 12th, our unit, with a fifty-mile rapid assault, captured Hongmiaozhai, eighteen miles from Lanfeng, causing the enemy to flee. On September 28th, when a part of Chiang's 32nd Division passed through the Nanwang Third District, our militia attacked its rear, capturing one enemy soldier and seizing 450 rounds of ammunition, four shells, two hand grenades, a cart, and many supplies. The next day, our militia captured another enemy cart, two boxes of shells, and some supplies southeast of × village. During the Mid-Autumn Festival, our Linze Brigade and the Wugong Team of the Second and Sixth Districts launched a surprise attack on the puppet district headquarters in Dingmiao. The enemy had already fled to the vicinity of Heze City in the evening. Our army then brought back more than 7,000 catties of wheat that they had plundered from the Liberated Zone. On October 2nd, the Wugong Team of our Linze Fourth District pursued over 200 puppet Juye Seventh District troops looting grain in the Dakuaizhuang area, seizing two large carts of grain. On the night of the 9th, the Hua County urban area militia captured six "Homecoming Corps" members in the northern gate of the city. On the 10th, the militia of the Fifth District of the county attacked the Changyuan stubborn elements and "Homecoming Corps" who were looting in the Sangcun area, forcing the enemy to flee westward in panic, seizing seven livestock, a cart, and over a hundred pieces of clothing. On the 14th, more than 20 militia members from the Yunju Fourth District drove out over 400 of Wu Huawen's bandit troops who were harassing the Hanjiao, Pengzhuang, and Ligai area of our Fourth District. On the 15th, the Qimin Brigade of the Fifth Sub-district, in coordination with a unit of friendly forces, ambushed the enemy at Zhumiaodian, killing one enemy, capturing 15 enemies, and seizing four rifles, one pistol, and 190 rounds of ammunition. Currently, the masses in Henan, under the cover of armed struggle, have either finished planting wheat or are actively rushing to plant.
