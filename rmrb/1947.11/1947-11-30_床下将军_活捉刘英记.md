　　General Under the Bed
  　A Record of Liu Ying's Capture
    ·Yang Shuo·
    When Liu Ying, the commander of the Chiang bandit's 32nd Division, was captured, he was dragged out from under a bed in the division headquarters' basement under a stone bridge. When he was sent to the brigade command post, he was still covered in dust. This general under the bed, just two days before, had patted his chest and broadcast to the entire city of Shizhuang, boasting and bragging: "With me, there are no bandits (falsely referring to the People's Liberation Army); with bandits, there is no me."
    He was captured by Li Fu, a platoon deputy of the People's Liberation Army. When Li Fu, amidst the smoke of gunpowder, glimpsed several cars crowded in front of the basement, he guessed it was no ordinary place. He led several soldiers straight in and immediately captured dozens of enemies. As he was leading them westward, he learned from the prisoners' conversation that Chiang bandit Chief of Staff He Dingji was among them, but Liu Ying was nowhere to be found. Li Fu hurriedly turned back and ran back to the basement to search. While overturning a bed, someone suddenly grabbed his hand from under the bed. He pulled along the momentum, and someone rolled out from under the bed. After scrambling, he finally stood up and said repeatedly:
    "Hey, hey, you can have anything you want!"
    As he spoke, he rummaged through his pockets, pulled out a seal, and handed it over, saying:
    "If you take this, you will definitely be greatly rewarded by those above..."
    At this moment, Li Fu asked sternly: "Who exactly are you?" The other party mumbled, "I am the division commander," and then grabbed Li Fu's hand, pleading to be sent to the rear of the liberated area. He already knew that his superior, Luo Lirong, the commander of the Third Army, and others were safe and sound in the liberated area.
    After being brought to the brigade headquarters, the political commissar of our brigade asked Liu Ying to order a stop to the resistance. Liu Ying's face was pale, and he immediately wrote tremblingly: "I approve of stopping the fighting."

　　床下将军
  　活捉刘英记
    ·杨朔·
    蒋匪三十二师师长刘英被俘时，是从大石桥下的师部地下室床下被拖出来的。当他被送到旅指挥所时，还满身灰尘。这位床下将军前两天还拍着胸脯，对石庄全市广播，大吹牛皮的说：“有我无匪（诬指解放军），有匪无我。”
    捉到他的是解放军一个叫李福的排副。当李福在硝烟弥漫之中，瞥见地下室前面挤了几辆小汽车时，便猜想那不是平常的地方，他领着几个战士直冲进去，当即俘虏几十个敌人，他正带着往西走时，从俘虏谈话中查出蒋匪参谋长贺定纪，但是不见刘英，李福急转身跑回地下室搜查，在翻一张床时，忽然有人从床下先抓住他的手，他顺势一拉，就有个人从床底下滚出来，爬了爬才站起来，连声说道：
    “哎哎你要什么都给你！”
    他说着话，乱掏口袋，摸出一块图章递过来道：
    “你拿着这个，上面一定会大大奖励你……”
    此时，李福厉声问道：“你到底是谁？”对方嗫嚅着说：“我是师长，”又抓着李福的手恳求送他到解放区后方去，他已知道他的上级第三军军长罗历戎等都在解放区安然无恙。
    带到旅部后，我旅政委要刘英下令停止抵抗，刘英脸色苍白，随即战战兢兢提笔写道：“我准许停止战斗。”
