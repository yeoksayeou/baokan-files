Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 18th: The People's Liberation Army completely routed 35,000 bandits belonging to Ma Hongkui’s gang, who were reinforcing Yulin, on the 15th. This time, the Ma bandits left only a small number of security teams to guard Ningxia, and led all their bandits, comprising the reorganized 18th Division, two infantry brigades, one cavalry brigade, and four security regiments, a total force, departing from Sanbian on the 6th to recklessly reinforce Yulin. On the 13th, they advanced to the Yuan Da Tan (i.e., Liang Jiutan) desert area, 30 kilometers west of Yulin, where they were met with a head-on blow by our army. By noon on the 15th, the enemy was completely defeated by us and suffered heavy casualties. The enemy then fled westward in a panic. We seized a great deal of supplies, including more than ten mortars and more than seventy light machine guns. Our army is currently in hot pursuit.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 17th: The guerrilla war in the Guanzhong sub-region of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, protruding into the heartland of the Hu bandit territory, has achieved repeated victories in recent months. Since the Jiang bandits launched their attack on Guanzhong on February 19th until the end of September, the local armed forces have more than doubled in size during the struggle against the enemy. Our local armed forces, militia, and guerrillas have destroyed all of the enemy's puppet baojia organizations and expanded the liberated areas, successively establishing four democratic county governments in Sanyuan, Chunyi, Yaoxian, and Zhongyi (parts of中部and宜君). Currently, most of the thirteen markets in the sub-region have been restored. In the anti-"encirclement and suppression" struggle, the Chunyao militia guerrillas fought the enemy 183 times, eliminating 482 enemy soldiers, and recaptured key towns and vast rural areas such as Liulin, Miaowan, Yao’yi, and Zhaojin in the county. According to incomplete statistics, in the past seven months, the local armed militia guerrillas in the entire sub-region have fought the enemy 546 times, eliminating more than 400 enemy soldiers, seizing two small cannons, 21 machine guns, 718 long and short guns, and destroying 931 enemy bunkers and 40 fortresses.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 16th: The Yanchang Oil Factory, once famous throughout the country for producing 500 barrels of oil per day, suffered severe damage and destruction during the Jiang bandit occupation, to the point that residents in the mining area had no oil for lamps. When reporters inspected the oil refining department of the main factory and the Qilicun branch factory, weeds grew everywhere, and rubble blocked the roads. Rusty machine parts were discarded everywhere. According to the person in charge of the factory, when the Jiang bandits invaded the mining area, all the workers, in coordination with the factory, transferred the repair department and important machines in advance for protection. However, the heavy machines that could not be moved were mostly destroyed by the enemy, the houses were demolished, the wood was used as fuel or for building fortifications, and various auxiliary facilities were also ruined by the enemy. During the enemy's occupation, the workers formed a guerrilla team, which frequently attacked the enemy. On the night of April 24th, the guerrilla team learned that the enemy intended to use the main furnace to refine oil for military use. The squad leader, Fan Zizhong, immediately led the team to attack the oil factory. Workers such as Lei Yutian felt their way to the main factory and threw grenades into the courtyard and distributed leaflets. The enemy occupying the factory had to retreat into the city, and from then on, the enemy dared not refine oil again. In the battle to recover Yanchang, the guerrilla team effectively cooperated with the main force. Now, the guerrilla workers have returned to the factory to plan for the resumption of work.
