Xinhua News Agency, Henan-Shaanxi Front, 16th: Our army on the eastern front has recaptured Fangcheng and Linru towns, deterring the advance of Chiang Kai-shek's 5th Army Corps. After launching a powerful offensive between Dengfeng and Fangcheng starting on the 1st, we forced the seven brigades of Chiang Kai-shek's 5th Army Corps, which were blindly "advancing westward," to rush south under the personal command of Li Tiejun. On the 2nd, they advanced to Linru Town and successively invaded Linru, Dengfeng, Jiaxian, Baofeng, Lushan, Yexian, Fangcheng and other cities. Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, with a force of 30,000, were tightly packed together and never dared to disperse. Our army maneuvered and shifted, using a portion of its forces to outflank and attack the enemy's flanks and rear. On the 8th, Linru Town was recaptured, and on the 11th, Fangcheng was recaptured.

Xinhua News Agency, Henan-Shaanxi Front, 16th: Our guerrilla corps is extremely active between Fangcheng and Nanyang. At 13:00 on the 13th, a unit of our guerrillas occupied Sheqi Town, 100 li east of Nanyang City, capturing more than 60 people, including the deputy director of Chiang Kai-shek's Public Security Bureau, as well as more than 50 rifles and pistols. At noon on the same day, another guerrilla unit annihilated a portion of local reactionaries led by Wang Jingxuan, the Chiang Kai-shek appointed head of Fangcheng County, and Ma Mingwu, the head of the security regiment, in the Xugang area, 40 li southeast of Fangcheng, capturing 30 men and weapons.

Recently, another 12,000 liberated peasants in the southern Liaoning New District have joined the main force. In Zhuanghe County alone, from October 1st to 8th, 1,094 young people from the entire county signed up to join the army, and after examination, 897 were accepted. When the conscript column passed in front of the Liaonan Daily office in the county, the cheering masses requested that the new soldiers be commended in the newspaper. In Boluo Pu, Yingkou, at a mass meeting of more than 7,000 people, more than 120 young people volunteered to join the main force.

Tens of thousands of liberated peasants in eastern Liaoning organized stretcher-bearer and cart teams for long-distance expeditions, and they are heading to the front lines in batches. When the Benxi stretcher-bearer team set off, they firmly stated to the 10,000 cheering people: "Wherever the army goes, we will follow!" Zhang Deren, the leader of the 19 stretcher-bearers in Liuhe, asked the supply station every day: "We don't need to change shifts, we will wait until the battle is over before going home." In the war zone, the masses participating in the war launched a fire line merit competition. In the battle to annihilate the 116th Division of the enemy at Yejibei, Xifeng, more than 1,000 civilian workers braved enemy fire to transport ammunition to the fire line with stretchers, and then carried the wounded soldiers to safe locations.

In the past five months, 60,000 liberated peasants in eastern Hebei have joined the People's Liberation Army, and four liberated peasant regiments have been established in Baodi County alone.

　　豫陕我军机动打击蒋匪出犯
  　再克方城及临汝镇
    南阳附近我游击队克赊旗镇
    【新华社豫陕前线十六日电】东线我军再克方城及临汝镇。阻遏蒋匪第五兵团之进犯。一日起我在登封至方城间发动强大攻势之后，迫使正在盲目“西进”的蒋匪第五兵团七个旅，急由李铁军亲率南犯。二日进至临汝镇，并相继侵陷临汝、登封、郏县、宝丰、鲁山、叶县、方城等城。蒋匪以三万之众而紧挤一团，始终不敢分散，我军则机动转移，并以一部迂回袭敌侧背，八日再克临汝镇，十一日再克方城。
    【新华社豫陕前线十六日电】方城、南阳间我游击兵团极为活跃。十三日下午我游击队一部，占领南阳城东一百里之赊旗镇，俘获蒋记公安局副局长以下六十余人，长短枪五十余支。同日中午，我另一游击部队在方城东南四十里之徐岗一带，击溃蒋记方城县长王敬轩及保安团长马鸣武所率之土顽一部，俘获人枪三十余。
    辽南新区最近又有一万二千余翻身农民拥入主力。庄河县仅十月一日至八日，全县即有一千零九十四名青年报名参军，经检查后录取八百九十七名。当参军行列路经该县辽南日报社门前时，欢送群众纷纷要求给新战士们登报表扬。营口薄洛铺，在某次七千余群众大会上，有一百二十余青年自动报名参加主力。
    辽东数万翻身农民组织的远征担架及大车队一批批涌向前线。本溪担架队出发时向万余欢送群众坚决表示：“军队到那里我们跟到那里。”柳河张德仁领导的十九个担架队员天天向兵站要求：“我们不用换班，等到打完仗再回家。”各地参战群众在战地掀起火线立功竞赛，西丰野鸡背千余民工在歼敌一一六师战斗中，冒敌人火力用担架运输弹药至火线上，回头又把负伤战士抬至安全地点。
    冀东最近五个月有六万翻身农民参加解放军，宝坻一县即成立了四个翻身团。
