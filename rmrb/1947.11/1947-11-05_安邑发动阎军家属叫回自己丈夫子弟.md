    [Taiyue Dispatch from Our Paper, 2nd] An邑 has mobilized the families of Yan Army soldiers to launch a "rescue our children, speak out grievances, and attack their hearts" movement. Under Yan's conscription, poor families' children are constantly being seized and forced to serve Yan. The Second District Office of An邑 convened a meeting of Yan Army family members from twenty-nine villages during the Mid-Autumn Festival, adopting a sympathetic and caring attitude towards them, encouraging them to find ways to rescue their children and bring them home. At the meeting, Liu Genjie's father from Duan Village cried bitterly, saying, "Both of my children have been conscripted into the army, and their lives are uncertain. I farm twelve mu of land for others, but the grain I harvest isn't enough to live on. It's truly us who go hungry, and it's still us who are forced to death by the stubborn enemy." An old woman from Guo Town said, "I live close to An邑, but I rarely see my younger brother." While speaking, she cursed Chiang Kai-shek. In the end, everyone said: "Crying alone won't solve anything. We still need to find ways to rescue them. As long as we sincerely persuade our husbands to kill Yan and return, no matter how deep the enemy's city walls are, we will find ways to rescue them." As of October 2nd, they had come up with many methods, and had already called back thirty-one people from An邑 city.

    安邑发动阎军家属叫回自己丈夫子弟
    【本报太岳二日电】安邑发动阎军家属，展开抢救子弟诉苦攻心运动。在阎匪抓丁之下，不断将穷苦人家子弟抓去，被迫为阎匪服务。安邑二区公所，曾于中秋节召开了二十九村阎匪家属会议，对他们采取了同情关心的态度，使他们设法抢救其子弟归家。会上段村刘根节父亲痛哭流涕的说：“两个孩子都被抓去当了兵，现在生死不明，种人家十二亩地，所打粮食不够过活，真是饿肚皮是咱，当顽固逼死人还是咱。”郭镇的老娘说：“我离安邑倒近，可是老见不到我妹”。边说边哭的咒骂蒋介石。最后大家说：光哭不顶事，还是想办法搭救他们吧，只要实心叫自己的丈夫杀阎回来，不管敌人的城墙有多深，都有办法搭救他们。至十月二日，他们有了不少办法，从安邑城已叫回三十一人。
