　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th. Warsaw dispatch: The Central Committee of the Polish Trade Union Federation recently held a plenary session in Warsaw, which concluded on the 23rd. When General Secretary Kuliauvitz reported on organizational matters, he pointed out: There are 37 trade unions under the federation, and as of August 31, there were 2.7 million members. The new democratic system has made unity among Polish trade unions possible. Chairman Witashuski pointed out in his report: "The basic tasks facing the Polish working people are: to consolidate the united front of the working class, to consolidate the alliance of workers and peasants, and to realize the three-year national reconstruction plan." Mr. Ni criticized the so-called "Marshall Plan" as "merely an attempt to abolish the economic and political independence of various countries, which will inevitably lead to hunger, poverty, and unemployment." He continued: "This attempt has been resolutely opposed by the peace-loving forces led by the Soviet Union. The people's democratic countries are playing a major role in this struggle." When Secretary Sokolski made a report analyzing the domestic economic situation, he pointed out that the current competition initiated by Polish youth to improve labor productivity is of great significance. Mr. Suo said: "Our labor is the best answer to the policy of imperialist expansion, and it is also the best answer to Germany, which is gradually rising under the protection of the United States. We will never sell our freedom for the leftovers of the United States. We are strengthening our economic strength and opening up our future with selfless work. The current labor competition symbolizes our patriotism, our class consciousness, and our national dignity." Mr. Suo called: "1948 should be a year of further revitalizing the country and improving the living standards of the working people."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st. Warsaw dispatch: Representatives of the Polish Workers' Party (i.e., the Polish Communist Party) and the Socialist Party recently held a joint meeting in Stettin, a port newly transferred to Poland by the Soviet occupation authorities in Germany. The two sides reached a resolution, emphasizing the importance of cooperation between the two workers' parties in strengthening the domestic and foreign democratic movements. It also pointed out: "The best answer to the American and British imperialists is to consolidate the united front of the two workers' parties, strengthen propaganda against warmongers, and strengthen the struggle against the anti-Soviet offensive of the reactionaries." The resolution also expressed full agreement with the decision of the Nine-Nation Communist Party Information Conference. According to reports, the youth leagues of the two parties had already signed a cooperation agreement in August.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. Warsaw dispatch: Polish Prime Minister and General Secretary of the Socialist Party Cyrankiewicz made a report at the Warsaw Conference of the Party, emphasizing: "The organization of class-conscious workers all over the world is the key to permanent peace; and the powerful Soviet Union is the fortress for the struggle for peace and the main force for restoring Polish independence." Mr. Xi severely criticized the betrayal of the right-wing social democratic parties in Western Europe, saying that their "policy of succumbing to money is defending the interests of American imperialism." Mr. Xi finally stated: "Molotov's slogan calling on all democratic forces to unite against the adventurous plans of the warmongers reflects the growing solidarity of the peace-loving democratic countries."

    【新华社陕北二十五日电】华沙讯：波兰职工会中央委员会日前在华沙召开全体会议，业已于二十三日闭幕。该会总书记库里劳维兹报告组织问题时指出：归该会统属的职工会有三十七个，截至八月三十一日止，已有会员二百七十万人，新民主制度已使波兰职工会间的团结成为可能。该会主席威塔修斯基在其报告中指出：“波兰劳动人民所面临的基本任务是：巩固工人阶级的统一战线，巩固工人与农民的联盟，实现国家复兴的三年计划。”尼氏批评所谓“马歇尔计划”为“只是取消各国经济与政治独立的企图，将不可避免地造成饥饿贫困与失业。”继称：“这一企图受到以苏联为首的爱好和平力量的坚决反对。人民的民主国家在这一斗争中起着重大作用。”该会书记索柯尔斯基作分析国内经济情况的报告时，指出目前波兰青年为提高劳动生产率而发起的竞赛，意义极为重大。索氏称：“我们的劳动乃是对帝国主义扩张政策的最好答复，而且也是对在美国庇护下日渐抬头的德国的最好答复，我们决不为美国的残羹剩饭而出卖自由，我们正以无我的工作壮大我们的经济力量，并开拓我们的前途。当前的劳动竞赛象征着我们的爱国精神，我们的阶级觉悟和我们的民族尊严。”索氏号召：“一九四八年应成为进一步复兴国家与提高劳动人民生活水平的一年。”

    【新华社陕北二十日电】华沙讯：波兰总理社会党总书记西伦凯维兹，日前在该党华沙会议上作报告，强调指出：“全世界有阶级自觉的工人底组织，是永久和平底关键；而强大的苏联，就是为和平斗争的堡垒，是恢复波兰独立的主力。”西氏严辞抨击西欧各国右翼社会党的背叛行为称：它们“屈服于金元之下的政策，是在卫护美帝国主义底利益。”西氏最后力称：“莫洛托夫号召一切民主力量团结起来反对战争贩子冒险计划的口号，反映了爱好和平的民主国家阵营日趋增长的团结”。
