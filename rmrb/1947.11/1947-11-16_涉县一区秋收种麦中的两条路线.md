Two Lines in Autumn Harvest and Wheat Planting in Shexian County, First District

After more than twenty days of intensive work, the autumn harvest and wheat planting in the first district of Shexian County were completed by the ninth day of the ninth lunar month. According to statistics from twenty-four villages, more than 34,700 mu of wheat were planted, accounting for 78 percent of the total land area. In Henan Dian, the planting rate reached 81 percent. On October 29th, the entire district made a summary, and the summary revealed two different lines in promoting the harvest and planting, leading to two different results. This year's wheat planting was the first time farmers planted wheat after the land reform, so the demand for wheat planting was quite urgent. In villages such as Nanzhuang, Yantou, and Qujun, this characteristic was grasped, and the poor and hired peasants were boldly empowered. At the same time, the difficulties of the poor and hired peasants in planting wheat were resolved, so the wheat planting work proceeded very smoothly. Yantou Village was one of the villages with the most confused class concepts. The village cadres were arrogant, disregarded the district cadres, associated with landlords, and sheltered landlords, adopting an attitude of looking down on and even suppressing the poor and hired peasants. At the beginning of this harvest and planting, the district cadres found this key and realized that it would not work without mobilizing the poor and hired peasants, so they personally went to the homes of the poor and hired peasants to visit them. During the visits, it was discovered that the mutual aid group included the landlord Zhang Yongde, who was in control, and he had the messenger fetch his meals every time. At this time, the leadership used actual events to educate the cadres, divide classes, and initially enlighten the cadres' class consciousness, and made a self-criticism at the meeting of the poor and hired peasants. During the self-criticism, retired soldier Liu Zhitian raised an opinion, saying: "I have three questions: First, I am dirt poor, do you want to eliminate me? Second, I am a retired soldier, how do you take care of me? Third, who are in the mutual aid group? Who are you cadres working for? Are the landlords' wives in the mutual aid group feeding pigs or wolves?" After this was raised, the cadres felt deeply that something was wrong and examined their thinking. At this time, the leadership supported the poor and hired peasants, asked the cadres to make a self-criticism, and expelled eight landlords, including Zhang Yongde, from the mutual aid group, and the masses managed it. This greatly excited the poor and hired masses, and absorbed the poor and hired peasants to participate in mutual aid. One poor and hired peasant said when joining the group: "If you drive out the landlords, I want to join the mutual aid, do you think it's okay?" Everyone welcomed him and said, "Okay!" On this basis, mutual aid was expanded, the poor and hired peasants took power, and a plan was made. This year, the whole village planted 1,414 mu, accounting for 81 percent of the total land. In wheat planting, a poor and hired peasant named Liu Shuzhi, who is over fifty years old, patiently persuaded the Lijang (village head) to plant more wheat. Wang Laishun's mother organized women to plant wheat in the flower fields. The poor and hired peasants played a great role in promoting and leading the work. Nanzhuang paid attention to solving the difficulties of poor and hired peasants from beginning to end in the wheat planting campaign. At the beginning of the wheat planting, eight donkeys from the fruits were divided among 45 poor and hired peasants who had not yet turned over through evaluation, which solved their difficulty of not being able to plant wheat due to lack of livestock. Later, after checking door to door, it was found that a total of 13 households had no wheat seeds, and 7.6 dou of wheat seeds were adjusted. During the campaign, it was found that a rich peasant in Sanjie was acting as the production team leader, passively avoiding work. After it was discovered, the poor and hired peasants were mobilized to discuss it among the masses, and they boldly replaced him with the poor and hired peasant Hao Tianzhu to lead. The wheat planting work in the whole village was completed quickly and abundantly, increasing the wheat field by more than 800 mu compared with last year, planting more than 37 qing in total, accounting for 84 percent of the total land. At the beginning of Qujun Village, the opinions of the poor and hired peasants on inter-planting were listened to, and inter-planting was carried out mainly by the poor and hired peasants. Under the leadership of the poor and hired peasants, more than 2,000 mu were inter-planted in six days. In order to unify leadership, the poor and hired peasants were organized into four teams and twelve groups according to the deputy village, with a total of more than 120 people, which greatly promoted the work in the whole village. Another line was that the district cadres were surrounded by the village cadres, and the village leadership group looked down on the poor and hired peasants, so the wheat planting work was passive and laissez-faire from beginning to end. The village head of Zhuangshang Village was a bankrupt landlord, indifferent to work, and the upper and lower streets fought for power and profit. The cadres in the lower street did not work, but specialized in finding fault with others. Whoever approached the district cadres was said to be a bad person. Although the district cadres also knew their situation, they mainly relied on the cadres, could not break the circle of the cadres, and were surrounded by the village cadres, unable to go deep into the masses, forming a disconnection. When other villages had started inter-planting, the district cadres urged, saying: "We should start inter-planting!" The village cadres said: "Our village has a lot of paddy fields, so we can't take care of inter-planting, let's put it off for later!" Making the wheat planting laissez-faire. Finally, during the blitz, the district cadres had no choice but to order the heads of each street and the Lijang, and the Lijang went down to order the masses. Chikan Village was led by old middle peasants. At the beginning of wheat planting, the cadres didn't take it as a matter at all. The village head excused himself, saying: "I want to hold a meeting of poor and hired activists, but the chairman of the farmers' association is sick. We are in the political system, and we don't know who they all are, so we can't hold it!" The district cadres could not push it. From the above two lines, it can be definitely proved that all work will be completed and done well and quickly with poor and hired backbones; otherwise, the work will not be done well.

　　涉县一区秋收种麦中的两条路线
    涉县一区收秋种麦工作经过二十多天的突击，到阴历九月初九日即全部完成了，据二十四个村统计，共种麦三万四千七百余亩，占总土地的百分之七十八，河南店基点种到百分之八十一。十月二十九日，全区作了总结，从总结中发现在推动收种中两条不同的路线，得出了两个不同的结果。今年的种麦是在土改以来，农民有了土地，第一次种麦，所以种麦的要求是相当的迫切，在南庄、沿头、曲峻等村，掌握了这个特点，大胆的由贫雇掌权，同时解决了贫雇的种麦困难，所以种麦工作很顺利的展开了。沿头村工作是阶级观点最糊涂的一个村子，村干部自高自大，不尿区干部，和地主来往，包庇地主，对贫雇采取看不起，甚至打击的态度。这次收种开始，区干部找着了这个关键，认识到不发动贫雇不行，所以就亲自深入到贫雇家里访问。在访问中发现了互助组内有地主张永德，在里面掌握，他顿顿吃饭用通信员给打着吃。这时领导上即在干部中拿实际事情进行了教育，划分阶级，初步启发了干部的阶级自觉，在贫雇会议上作了检讨。检讨时，荣退军人刘志田提意见说：“我提三个问题：第一、我是赤贫，你们是不是消灭？第二、我是荣退军人，你们照顾我如何？第三、互助里都是那些人？你们当干部是为谁办事的？地主妇女在互助组内是喂猪呢？还是喂狼呢？”这样提出后，干部深感不对，检查了思想，这时领导上给贫雇撑了腰，叫干部作了检讨，将互助中张永德等八个地主挤了出去，由群众管理起来。这样大大的兴奋了贫雇群众，并吸收了贫雇参加互助，一个贫雇在入组时说：“把地主赶光了，我要入互助，你们看看行不行？”大家欢迎说：“行！”在这个基础上，扩大了互助，贫雇掌了权，订出了计划，今年全村种了一千四百十四亩，占总土地百分之八十一。在种麦中，一个叫刘树枝，现年五十岁多的贫雇群众，他耐心的说服闾长多种麦子，王来顺的娘组织妇女往花地里栽麦子，贫雇在运动中起了大大的推动作用与骨干领导作用。南庄在种麦运动中自始至终都注意了解决贫雇农的困难，种麦一开始即将果实中八头驴经过评议分给了四十五户贫雇未翻身户，解决了他们的没畜力不能种麦困难，后又经过挨门挨户的检查，发现共有十三户没有麦种，调剂了七斗六升麦种。在运动中发现三街富农，当了生产队长，消极逃躲。发现后即发动贫雇到群众中一酝酿，便大胆的撤换了，换上贫雇郝天柱来领导。全村的种麦工作完成的又快、又多，较之去年增加了八百多亩麦田，共种了三十七顷多，占总土地的百分之八十四。曲峻村开始是听取了贫雇的串种意见，以贫雇为主进行了串种，在贫雇带头下，六天即串种了二千多亩。为了统一领导，按副村将贫雇组织成四个分队十二个小组，共一百二十多人，对全村工作推进很大。另一条路线是区干部受村干部包围，村的领导集团看不起贫雇，所以种麦工作自始至终表现消极自流。庄上村村长是破落地主，对工作漠不关心，上下街争权夺利，下街的干部不做工作，专找其他人的毛病，谁要接近区干部就说是坏人，区干部虽然也知道他们的情况，但主力还是依靠干部，打不开干部的圈子，被村干部包围着，深入不了群众，形成不接气。其他村都串种开了，区干部督促说：“咱们该串种啦！”村干部却说：“俺村水地多，顾不上串种，往后靠靠再说吧！”使得种麦自流。最后突击时，区干没法，所以命令各街长、闾长，闾长下去命令群众。赤岸村是老中农领导，种麦开始，干部就没把它当成个事，村长借口说：“咱倒想开个贫雇积极分子会吧，人家农会主任病了，咱是政权系统，不知都是谁，没法开！”区干部推也推不动。从以上两条路线中，可以肯定的证明：一切工作有贫雇骨干是会完成而且做的好，做的快；否则工作是不会做的好的。（邢崇智）
