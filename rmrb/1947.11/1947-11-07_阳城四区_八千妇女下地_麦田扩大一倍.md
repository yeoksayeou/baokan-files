According to incomplete statistics, 25,206 mu of grain were harvested, 16,502 mu of corn were harvested, 4,180 mu of corn were carried, and 6,466 mu of beans were harvested (the above figures are missing one joint village). 1,235 mu of millet were harvested (missing two joint villages), 2,258.25 mu were plowed, 297 mu of straw were carried, 259.3 mu were plowed, and 8,534 loads of coal were carried. Secondly, each village rectified its mutual aid teams in advance, and many villages used hired and poor peasants as the backbone. In particular, the objects of struggle were purged from the leadership, with Baijian Village being the best example. Hired and poor peasants seized leadership, and under the active leadership of the poor and hired, the entire village completed the autumn harvest and autumn planting three days ahead of schedule and was rated as a model for the entire district. In addition, each village universally established broadcasting stations and hero newspapers for commendation and criticism, so as to achieve timely commendation and criticism, and promote the autumn harvest and autumn planting work. There was also a sound meeting reporting system to timely check, discover, and solve problems. Each base point had a meeting every five days to check the work, study, and solve problems.
