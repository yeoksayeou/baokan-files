　　Yu-Shaan-E Established Administrative Office
  　Established Thirty-Seven Democratic County Governments
    Eradicate Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Tyranny and Assist Peasants in Achieving Complete Emancipation
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yu-Shaan Front, 19th] The Yu-Shaan-E Border Region Administrative Office has been formally established, with Gao Yunsheng and Yang Shaoqiao serving as Director and Deputy Director, respectively. According to Director Gao, after the Chen-Xie army advanced into Yu-Shaan, liberating vast areas and destroying the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, we immediately established democratic political power. Currently, we have established seven districts and administrative offices, thirty-seven democratic county governments, and several other administrative offices and county governments are being actively prepared. Democratic district and village offices have also been largely established, with most village administrations being generated by mass elections. Except for some areas that were established as democratic base areas during the Civil War and the Anti-Japanese War, this is the first time that the people in most of the Yu-Shaan-E region have enjoyed democratic rights. After the establishment of democratic political power at all levels, the administrative program was announced, the tyranny of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits was eradicated, social order was stabilized, and efforts were made to mobilize the masses to distribute land and assist the peasants in achieving emancipation; therefore, it has won the support of the broad masses of peasants.
