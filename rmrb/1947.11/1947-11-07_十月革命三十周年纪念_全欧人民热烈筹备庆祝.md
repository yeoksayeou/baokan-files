Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 5th: Comprehensive reports indicate that as the 30th anniversary of the October Revolution approaches, Eastern and Western European countries are enthusiastically preparing to celebrate this "great festival." The Czechoslovakian people's preparations are being carried out under the slogan "Without the October Revolution, there would be no Czechoslovakian independence and freedom." Before November 1st, residents of cities and villages in Czechoslovakia, as well as workers in state-owned enterprises, sent 189,000 congratulatory postcards to the Soviet government and Marshal Stalin. On November 6th and 7th, grand celebratory parades will be held in all towns and villages in Czechoslovakia. Yugoslavia will have a holiday to commemorate this festival. The whole country is busy preparing for a grand commemoration. Workers in various factories are engaged in enthusiastic production competitions to commemorate the October Revolution. The State Publishing Bureau will also publish books on the Soviet Union's achievements in various fields over the past thirty years. On the 6th and 7th, commemorative meetings and torchlight parades will be held throughout Yugoslavia. Hungarian workers are preparing a large number of gifts for Stalin as thanks from the Hungarian people for the Red Army's liberation of Hungary. The "Thirty Years of the Soviet Union" exhibition will be held in Budapest at that time. Romania is commemorating the great October Revolution by holding a "Romanian-Soviet Friendship Week." Workers at the "Guerrilla" factory and power station in Tirana, the capital of Albania, sent a congratulatory telegram to Soviet workers saying: "The example of the Soviet people tells us how to build a happy life in our country. We are not afraid of the imperialist conspiracy, because the interests of small countries are protected by the solid Soviet Union and the great leader of the Soviet Union, Stalin." The propaganda campaign in Bulgaria celebrating the October Revolution began in late October, and celebration committees have been established in various towns. Congratulatory telegrams signed by 439,576 Finnish citizens have been sent to the Soviet government.

The heroic Italian working class, disregarding the interference of American imperialism and the obstruction of domestic reactionary authorities, is also actively carrying out preparatory work. The leadership organs of the Italian Communist Party and the Socialist Party issued a joint communiqué on the 2nd stating: The two parties have jointly decided to hold rallies and parades in various cities in Italy to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Socialist October Revolution. On November 7th, Togliatti (leader of the Italian Communist Party) and Nenni (leader of the Socialist Party) will both give speeches in Rome. Speakers designated by the two parties will give speeches in the central cities of various provinces and cities across the country on the 9th (Sunday). The General Confederation of Labor has issued an order to all provinces to guarantee the organization of commemorative meetings, in which more than three million members of the two parties and all working people will participate.

In London, the October Revolution exhibition held by the British-Soviet Friendship Association opened on the 2nd. The opening ceremony was addressed by Soviet Ambassador Zarubin, and was attended by the ambassadors of South Africa, Mexico and other countries, diplomatic corps, British members of parliament, trade unions and representatives of public organizations.
