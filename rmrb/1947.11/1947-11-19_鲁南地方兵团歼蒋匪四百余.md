　　Xinhua News Agency, East China, 17th: A portion of the local backbone troops of Lunan, on the 9th, in the Chengqian (northeast of Tengxian County) area, with a casualty ratio of twelve to one against the enemy, and in one hour of combat, annihilated an enemy regimental headquarters and a battalion, creating a brilliant example of the local troops in the area annihilating Chiang Kai-shek's regular army. On the morning of that day, the 43rd Regiment of the newly reorganized 15th Brigade of Chiang Kai-shek's 72nd Division (note: this division was entirely annihilated in the Tai'an battle in April of this year and has been reorganized), led by its regimental commander Xu Hua, advanced towards us along the Fengmao-Chengqian highway in Tengxian County, and sneaked into the Chengqian area. They were met with a fierce attack by our ambushing troops. After an hour of fierce fighting, the entire enemy force was annihilated. In addition to killing the enemy regimental commander Xu Hua and battalion commander, a total of 445 enemy soldiers were annihilated, including 208 captured enemy soldiers, 4 mortars and other weapons seized, 12 light and heavy machine guns, 634 rounds of various shells, more than 70,000 rounds of bullets, rifles and other military supplies. We only sacrificed 7 people and injured 29 people. The Lunan Military Region has issued a commendation order.
