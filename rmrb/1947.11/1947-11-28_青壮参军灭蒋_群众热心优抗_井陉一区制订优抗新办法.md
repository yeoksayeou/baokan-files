　　Jingxing First District Formulates New Preferential Treatment Measures for Supporting the Frontline
    [Our Newspaper Jingxing News] In the final stage of the army recruitment campaign, the First District convened a meeting of key village cadres from the entire district on November 12th to summarize the recruitment efforts and discuss the formulation of new preferential treatment measures for military families. It was decided that the living standards of military families should be guaranteed to be exactly the same as their own. The specific approach is to first convene a meeting of military families to encourage them to express their opinions, and cadres and the masses should make sincere self-criticisms and propose future guarantees. Military families should establish military family associations and organize military family groups. In addition to leading military families to make conscious efforts in production, they are also responsible for ensuring that each military family receives reasonable preferential treatment from the village government. A committee for preferential treatment of military families will also be organized to specifically manage the work of preferential treatment of military families under the leadership of the village government. Regarding substitute farming, households without labor force will guarantee grain production of four shi per person, three shi per two people, and two shi per person for those with three or more people (calculated in coarse grains, changing substitute farming mu to substitute farming actual grain production). If the labor force of the military family is insufficient, substitute farming will be used to make up for it. Those who can voluntarily provide labor will not receive substitute farming preferential treatment. Sufficient water and firewood will be guaranteed. When military families without labor or widowed and orphaned military families suffer from illness, the village government will temporarily allocate labor and provide care as needed. Each organizational system will educate members to strive to be models of supporting the frontline, self-report the amount of substitute farming and firewood and water, and achieve complete fixed households or fixed persons (several households and several people manage one military family). At the end of the year, inspections will be carried out, with rewards for good performance and punishments for bad performance. (Wenhua)

  　井陉一区制订优抗新办法
    【本报井陉讯】一区在参军运动的末期，于十一月十二日召开全区主要村干会议，总结参军，并讨论制订了优待军属新办法。决定要把军属生活优待到和自己生活一模一样。具体作法是首先召开军属会，启发军属提意见，干部和群众要作诚心诚意的检讨，并提出今后保证。军属成立军属会，并组织军属小组，除领导军属尽力自觉生产外，并负责各军属得到村公所的合理优待。另组织优待军属委员会，在村公所领导下，专管优待军属工作。关于代耕，无劳力户保证产粮一人四石，二人三石，三人以上者每人两石（以粗粮计算，改代耕亩为代耕实产粮）。如军属劳力不足者，代耕以补齐。劳力能自愿者，不代耕优待。水管够用，柴管够烧。无劳力或孤寡军属患疾病时，由村公所临时拨工和按需照顾。各组织系统教育会员争取优抗模范，自报代耕和柴水数，做到完全固定户或固定人，（几户几人管一家军属），年底检查，好的奖励坏的处分。（文华）
