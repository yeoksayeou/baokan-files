Xinhua News Agency, Front Lines of Hubei, Henan, and Anhui, 3rd: Our reporter Li Pu reports: The characteristics of the Battle of Gaoshanpu: (1) Two and a half brigades of Chiang Kai-shek's troops were completely annihilated in broad daylight in less than five hours, while the price paid by the People's Liberation Army was unexpectedly small. The enemy's 40th Division headquarters and one regiment at Jieling Gaoshanpu collapsed in less than an hour after being attacked. The 316th Regiment between Qingshuihe and Jieling was defeated by a platoon of our army. This platoon captured three hilltops in one go. The 82nd Brigade collapsed without a fight once it discovered it was surrounded. According to prisoners, Li Zhenqing, commander of the 40th Division, pretended to be sick in Qichun before the departure, not daring to go into battle, and luckily escaped. The decline in the morale of Chiang Kai-shek's troops from top to bottom is becoming increasingly obvious. (2) Chiang Kai-shek's 40th Division had conscripted a large number of farmers from the liberated areas into the army before it was transferred from Hebei, Shandong, and Henan. This time, these people mostly went to the People's Liberation Army happily without firing a single shot. The more Chiang Kai-shek lacks manpower, the more frantically he conscripts soldiers, and the more impossible it becomes for him to fight. (3) Chiang Kai-shek's troops are completely ignorant of the situation, blundering around like blind men, both in the old liberated areas and in the newly liberated areas. This time, Chiang Kai-shek's troops did not know they had been heavily surrounded until they were attacked. They deployed in a single long line formation for ten li. When they discovered that they were trapped in our army's pocket, they were still unable to change their deployment in time. The stupidity and incompetence of their commanders are evident. (4) This time, the People's Liberation Army was deployed with the participating units scattered in areas more than 300 li apart from east to west, yet they were able to gather in two days. With the momentum of troops descending from the sky, they launched a sudden and fierce attack on the enemy and reaped fruitful results.

    鄂东高山铺大歼灭战证明
    蒋匪兵力不足兵心厌战
    我军五小时即全歼敌两旅半
    【新华社鄂豫皖前线三日电】本社记者李普报导：高山铺之战的特点：（一）蒋匪军两个半旅在大白天不到五个钟头之内全军覆灭，而解放军所付代价却出乎意外的微小。在界岭高山铺的敌四十师师部和一个团被攻击不到一小时，就溃不成军。清水河和界岭之间的三一六团，被我军一个排所击溃。这个排并一口气连夺三个山头，八十二旅一经发现被围，就不战而溃。据俘虏称：四十师师长李振清出发前躲在蕲春装病，不敢上阵，侥幸脱逃。蒋匪上下士气的低落由此愈益明显。（二）蒋匪四十师在冀鲁豫调出前曾抓了大批解放区的农民当兵，这次这些人就大抵一枪也未放，就高高兴兴的跑到解放军来，蒋贼介石越是兵力不足，越是要疯狂抓丁，就越无法作战。（三）蒋匪军完全不明了情况，象瞎子一样乱撞，在老解放区如此，在新解放区仍如此。这次蒋匪军直到遭受围攻，才知道已经陷入重围，他们在十华里内摆下了一字长蛇的行军队形，而当发现被套入我军口袋内后，仍不能及时改变部署，其指挥者的愚蠢低能可见一般。（四）这回解放军出战，参战部队都分散在东西相距三百多里的地区之内，而竟在两天里集结起来。以奇兵天降之势，予敌以突然猛击，收获丰硕战果。
