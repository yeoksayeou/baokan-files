Jilu Yu Third and Fifth Special Districts
Rear Area Families Achieve Self-Sufficiency Through Production
[Report from this newspaper, Jilu Yu, 12th] The Administrative Office issued a circular on the 2nd of this month, commending the rear area families in the Third and Fifth Special Districts of Jilu Yu for achieving self-sufficiency through production. The circular stated: "Since the bandit Chiang invaded the Liberated Areas, many family members of Party, government, military, and civilian cadres and miscellaneous personnel have fled to Hebei from various special districts in Henan due to the seesaw battle situation. Although the government has issued relief and loans, it still cannot solve the entire food and clothing problem. Fortunately, the comrades in the rear area offices of each special district have painstakingly planned production, and the families have shown a high degree of enthusiasm for production, achieving remarkable results. Among them, the rear area families in the Third Special District have performed the best, earning 8 million yuan in four months, which can solve the food problem for 800 people. Therefore, except for 200 to 360 elderly, weak, sick, and disabled people who cannot produce and still need relief, all others no longer need public relief. Furthermore, they have established work-study primary schools, enabling family members' children to study and work at the same time, setting an example for solving family life problems." In order to encourage everyone's production enthusiasm, the Administrative Office awarded 100,000 yuan to the rear area families in the Third Special District. In addition, the rear area families in the Fifth Special District have also achieved good results in production, and their lives are mostly self-sufficient. Their learning enthusiasm is very high, and family members can regularly write letters to encourage the morale of the troops at the front and carry out village work. Therefore, the Administrative Office also awarded 20,000 yuan as a learning fee. Finally, the circular summarized their achievements, saying: "Their production is diverse, including spinning, weaving, making shoes, making clothes, transportation, and small-scale business operations. They have adopted the production policy of collective leadership, decentralized management, and consideration of both public and private interests. Experience has proven that by opening up the minds of cadres and family members, establishing a labor concept, creating a surge in production for self-sufficiency, and adding strong organizational leadership, the difficulties of displaced families can be solved. Everyone should work together to learn from them."

　　冀鲁豫三、五专区
    后方家属生产自给
    【本报冀鲁豫十二日电】行署于本月二日，通令表扬三、五专区后方家属生产自给。通令内称：自蒋匪进犯解放区以来，河南各专区，在拉锯形势下逃来河北的党政军民干杂人员家属很多，政府虽已发过救济及贷款，但仍不能解决全部衣食问题，幸经各专区后方办事处同志，苦心筹划生产，及各家属高度的生产热情，已获得显著成绩，其中以三专区后方家属生产最好，四个月即获利八百万元，能够解决八百人的食粮问题。因此，现在被救济的除了老弱病残不能生产的二百至三百六十人外，其他都再不要公家救济了，并且成立了工读小学，使家属子弟一面读书一面工作，树立了解决家属生活的旗帜。行署为了鼓励大家生产情绪，奖给三专区后方家属十万元。另外五专区后方家属，生产成绩也很好，生活已大部自给。学习情绪很高，家属能经常写信，鼓励前方士气，并进行驻村工作。因此，行署也奖给二万元，作为学习费。最后，通令内在总结他们的成绩时说：“他们的生产是各式各样的，纺织、做鞋、做衣服、运输、小本经营等，采取了集体领导、分散经营、公私兼顾的生产方针。经验证明，打通干部及家属思想，树立劳动观念，造成生产自给热潮，再加以有力的组织领导，流亡家属的困难就能解决，大家应共同努力向他们学习。”
