Weekly Comprehensive Battle Report
(November 13th to 19th)

    Jinchaji Battlefield: Only twenty days after the victory at Qingfengdian, the Jinchaji People's Liberation Army, from the 6th to the 12th, after six days and nights of fierce fighting, liberated Shijiazhuang, a key strategic stronghold and transportation hub in North China held by the Chiang bandits, annihilating over 20,000 enemy troops, including the 32nd Division of the Chiang bandit's 3rd Army, the 6th Regiment of the pseudo-Liu Huanan's Provisional 32nd Division, the 9th and 10th Brigades of the Hebei Security Forces, and the Chiang-backed "Homecoming Corps" from various counties. The Chiang bandit Shijiazhuang Municipal Government, Municipal Party Headquarters, and the reactionary exiled county governments of more than 20 counties were all wiped out in one fell swoop. Liu Ying, the commander of the enemy's 32nd Division, was also captured alive. This victory puts the Jinchaji People's Liberation Army in a more active position, while the Chiang bandits are in an even more passive position. The Jinchaji and Jinjiluyu liberated areas are now connected, and the overall strategic situation of the enemy and ourselves in North China will undergo major changes. The city was captured in just six days, setting a precedent for our liberation of large cities. After the liberation of Shijiazhuang, the Chiang bandits entrenched in Taiyuan and Baoding were greatly alarmed. Prices in Taiyuan rose several times a day, and the Yan bandits forced the people to build fortifications, while "the families of officials of the Baoding provincial (Chiang) government flocked to Beiping by car." (Associated Press)

    East China Battlefield: On the 6th of this month, the People's Liberation Army routed the Chiang bandit's reorganized 9th Division and parts of the Chiang bandit's reorganized 64th, 54th, and 8th Divisions, about five and a half brigades in total, who were fleeing west for the second time in the Jiao (county) Gao (mi) area, annihilating more than 2,000 Chiang bandits. The Chiang bandits, who had repeatedly attempted to seize our Weihaiwei City, were repeatedly defeated and are now trapped in the Mianhua Mountain area a few miles outside the city. The Chiang bandits, who are mired in the quagmire of Jiaodong, are in a tragic situation of "difficult to defend and difficult to escape," and will not escape the fate of complete destruction like the Hu bandits in northern Shaanxi. At the same time, a part of our Lunan local main force corps annihilated a part of the Chiang bandit army's reorganized 72nd Division in the northeast of Teng County on the 9th, with a casualty ratio of twelve to one, killing and capturing more than 440 enemy troops, creating a glorious example of the local corps in the area annihilating the enemy's regular army. In the past forty days, our local armed forces in Binanhai launched continuous offensives on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, annihilating more than 3,500 enemy troops and recovering more than 520 villages and strongholds. At present, in the vast area of more than 200 miles from the Longhai Road in the south, the Yi River in the west, and the East China Sea in the east, there are no enemy traces except for the isolated strongholds around Xinhai, Tancheng, and Linyi. Our army also controls more than 100 miles of the Longhai Railway from Caobu to Ahu, cutting off the enemy's Haizheng Highway, enabling the people of Binan to directly connect and cooperate with the people behind enemy lines in northern Jiangsu.

    Northeast Battlefield: The offensive of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army is still expanding. The rear corps, under the slogan of "not afraid of the cold north wind, not afraid of sweating heavily in the flowing water," have been intensively engaged in military training, and military skills have been generally improved. The liberated peasants have set off a wave of joining the army, and a steady stream of reserve forces are constantly strengthening the front lines. The Chiang bandits, trapped in the isolated islands of Changchun, Jilin, and Shenyang in the cold winter, have generally experienced a coal shortage. Even the Chiang-backed Central News Agency revealed that "various (Chiang) agencies have not yet lit a fire in the howling cold wind." In order to cooperate with the Jinchaji People's Liberation Army in its operations, the Jidong Local Corps once attacked Wuqing County on the Pingjin Highway on the morning of the 12th, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 400 bandits.

    Northwest Battlefield: Just as our army was besieging Yulin, Ma Hongkui, disregarding the emptiness of his base in Ningxia, personally led about 35,000 infantry and cavalry troops to rush to reinforce it. On the 15th, our army took swift action to give the enemy a head-on blow in the Yuandatan and Liangjiutan areas 60 miles west of Yulin. After suffering heavy casualties, the enemy fled westward in a panic. The masses in the newly liberated Yulin are rising up to carry out liquidation struggles. The Guanzhong local armed forces, active in the heartland of the Hu bandits, have won successive victories in the anti-"encirclement and suppression" battles, and have established three original @邑, @county, and 中(部)宜(川) democratic county regimes. Most of the thirteen major markets in the area have also been restored by us.

    Sulu Yuwan Battlefield: Since the 9th, the People's Liberation Army has launched a large-scale sabotage operation on the 500-mile section of the Longhai Railway from Xu (zhou) to Lan (feng), which is still continuing. On the 11th, our army continued to capture many towns and stations such as Yucheng, Minquan, Libaji, and Liuheji, annihilating the entire Yucheng Brigade of the Chiang bandits and capturing 900 alive. On the same day, another unit of our army recovered Juye and Jiaxiang. Xiayi City was once liberated, and Xiaoxian, more than 40 miles southwest of Xuzhou, was captured. The Chiang bandits entrenched in Xuzhou were extremely panicked, and the city had announced a "special curfew," and "citizens fled one after another." (Associated Press)

    Yu-Shaan Battlefield: From the 8th to the 12th, the People's Liberation Army recaptured Fangcheng, Linyu City, and Linyu Town, while the Chiang bandit's 5th Corps' southward invasion was blocked by our army in the Lushan and Baofeng line. Our guerrilla corps between Fangcheng and Nanyang are also very active. On the 10th, a part of our army occupied Sheqi Town, 100 miles east of Nanyang City. On the same day, another unit defeated a part of the invading local bandits in the Xugang area southeast of Fangcheng. The Yu-Shaan Administrative Office has now been established, with seven special offices and thirty-seven democratic county governments under its jurisdiction. The Eyuwan People's Liberation Army captured Huoqiu City in western Anhui on the 7th of this month in one fell swoop.

    Jinji Luyu Area: The remaining Chiang bandits entrenched in the isolated islands in the area have recently been making desperate attempts to loot grain. The local bandits in Huojia, Xiuwu, and Wuzhi in northern Henan have all been met with head-on blows from the local army and people. The local armed forces of the nine counties of Anyang, Qixian, Huolu, and Yuci in Taihang killed and wounded a total of 1,100 grain-robbing Chiang bandits in twenty days last month. The Yuebei Local Corps annihilated about one battalion of Yan bandits in the first ten days of the month. A mass grain protection struggle has now been launched throughout the area.

　　一周综合战报
    （十一月十三日至十九日）
    晋察冀战场：距清风店大捷后仅二十日，晋察冀解放军从六日至十二日，经六昼夜激战，一举解放蒋匪华北战略据点及交通轮轴石家庄，尽歼守敌蒋匪第三军所属之三十二师，伪刘化南暂编三十二师第六团，河北保安第九、十两总队，蒋记各县“还乡团”等两万余人，蒋匪石庄市政府、市党部及二十余县之反动流亡县政府为我一网打尽，敌三十二师师长刘英亦为我生俘。此一胜利，使晋察冀解放军更处于主动，而蒋匪则更处于被动地位。晋察冀与晋冀鲁豫两大解放区从此联成了一片，整个华北敌我战略形势将发生重大变化。该城被攻克仅费时六天，为我解放大城市的创例。石家庄解放后，困踞太原与保定之蒋匪已大为惊恐，太原物价一日数涨，阎匪并强迫人民修筑防御工事，而“保定省（蒋）政府官员家属则纷乘汽车逃向北平”。（合众社）
    华东战场：解放军于本月六日于胶（县）高（密）地区击溃二次向西逃窜之蒋匪整九师及出援之蒋匪整六十四、整五十四、整八师各一部约五个半旅兵力，共歼灭蒋匪两千余人。几度图谋侵占我威海卫市之蒋匪，迭遭挫败，刻被困于市外数里之棉花山一带。而整个陷入胶东泥淖之蒋匪则处于“既难死守，又难逃走”的悲惨境地，将和陕北胡匪一样逃不了完全覆灭的命运。与此同时，我鲁南地方基干兵团一部，九日于滕县东北地区，以十二比一的敌我伤亡，歼灭蒋匪军整七十二师一部，共毙俘敌四百四十余人，创立该区地方兵团歼敌正规军之光辉战例。滨海南我地方武装近四十天内，于陇海东段展开连续性攻势，歼敌三千五百余人，克复村庄据点五百二十余处。刻南至陇海路，西至沂河，东至东海，纵横二百余里广大地区，除新海、郯城、临沂外围各孤立据点外，已无敌踪。我军并控制陇海路曹埠至阿湖段百余里，切断敌海郑公路，使滨南军民与苏北敌后军民取得直接连系与配合。
    东北战场：东北民主联军攻势仍在扩张，后方各兵团，在“不怕北风寒，不怕水淌流大汗”的口号下，已紧张的投入大练兵运动，军事技术普遍提高。翻身农民掀起参军热潮，源源而来之后备力量不断增强前线。寒冬中困守长春、吉林、沈阳等孤岛之蒋匪，已普遍发生煤荒，连蒋记中央社也透露出“各机关（蒋）在寒风怒吼声中，迄今犹未升火。”为配合晋察冀解放军作战，冀东地方兵团于十二日晨曾一度攻入平津公路上之武清县城，毙伤俘匪四百余人。
    西北战场：正当我军围攻榆林之际，马鸿逵不顾其老巢宁夏空虚，亲率步骑约三万五千人慌慌张张的赶来增援，十五日我军以神速动作，于榆林以西六十里之袁大滩及梁九滩地区予以迎头痛击，敌遭我重大杀伤后，狼狈向西逃窜。解放后之榆林新区群众，正奋起进行清算斗争。南线活跃于胡匪心脏地区之关中地方武装，在反“清剿”战斗中连续获胜，并建立三原、＠邑、＠县、中（部）宜（川）四个民主县政权，该区之十三个大集市亦为我大部恢复。
    苏鲁豫皖战场：自九日起，解放军对陇海路徐（州）兰（封）段五百里展开大破击，迄今仍在继续进行中。我军并于十一日续克虞城、民权、李坝集、柳河集等城镇车站多处，共歼蒋匪虞城总队全部，生俘九百名。同日，另部我军收复钜野、嘉祥。夏邑城一度解放，并攻克徐州西南四十余里之萧县，盘踞徐州之蒋匪极为恐慌，该市已宣布“特别戒严”，“市民纷纷逃亡”。（合众社）
    豫陕战场：八日至十二日，解放军再克方城、临汝城及临汝镇，而蒋匪第五兵团南犯，已遭我阻遏于鲁山、宝丰一线。方城南阳间我游击兵团亦异常活跃，十日我军一部占领南阳城东一百里之赊旗镇，同日另部于方城东南徐岗一带击溃进犯之土顽一部。豫陕行政公署现已成立，下属七个专署及三十七个民主县府。鄂豫皖解放军于本月七日一举攻占皖西之霍邱城。
    晋冀鲁豫方面：困守该区各孤岛之残余蒋匪近来作垂死挣扎性的抢粮骚扰。豫北获嘉、修武、武陟等地土顽，均遭当地军民迎头痛击；太行之安阳、淇县、获鹿、榆次等九县地方武装，上月二十天内共毙伤抢粮蒋匪一千一百余人。岳北地方兵团于上旬歼阎匪约一个营。刻全区已展开群众性的护粮斗争。（新华社陕北十九日电）
