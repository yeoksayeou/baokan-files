    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 5th: The Democratic Allied Forces annihilated the majority of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit New 1st Army's Provisional 56th Division (reorganized from the former Northeast Security 11th District troops) in the Datun Caojiatun area south of Changchun on the morning of the 3rd. At the same time, they annihilated a part of the bandit Huai'de Security Regiment northwest of Gongzhuling, striking a blow to the Chiang bandit's dream of opening up transportation between Changchun and Shenyang. In these two battles, a total of 305 enemies were killed or wounded, and more than 1,800 enemy soldiers, including the Provisional 56th Division's 1st Regiment Commander Wu Yukai, Deputy Regiment Commander Song Renjie, Huai'de Security Regiment Commander and Deputy Commander He Yulin and Wang Ming, were captured; 7 mortars and 60mm guns, 96 light and heavy machine guns, 1,040 long and short guns, and 150,000 rounds of ammunition were seized.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 5th: In the area west of Yixian, the Jireliao Liberation Army routed two Chiang Kai-shek bandit divisions attempting to invade Chaoyang, inflicting a devastating blow on the 21st Division of the 92nd Army, killing and capturing more than 3,000 enemy soldiers including division commanders, deputy division commanders, and chiefs of staff. After the Liberation Army recovered Chaoyang County, a key town on the border of Rehe and Liaoning provinces, on the 23rd of last month, Hou Jingru, commander of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit 92nd Army, personally led the army's 21st Division and the 43rd Division of the 94th Army, which had just been transferred from eastern Hebei and the Tianjin area to outside the pass for only one month, to aid in the rescue. On the 29th of last month, they advanced westward along both sides of the Jin (zhou) Cheng (de) line from Yixian, vainly attempting to retake Chaoyang. When the bandit army had just snaked to the vicinity of Jiuguantai, only thirty miles west of Yixian, our army suddenly surrounded the invading enemy before dawn on the 1st, compressing them into the mountainous area south of Jiuguantai, and completely defeated the bandits by noon on the 2nd, annihilating part of them. Under the cover of eight aircraft, the bandit army hastily abandoned all vehicles and ammunition, fleeing north across the Daling River towards Yixian in a panic. Preliminary statistics of the battle results: more than 1,000 enemy soldiers, including the 21st Division's Deputy Division Commander Li Youzong, were killed or wounded, and more than 2,000 enemy soldiers, including the division commander Guo Huicang and division chief of staff Ji Gaoxiang, were captured; more than 80 howitzers, field guns, mountain guns, mortars, and 60mm guns, more than 160 light and heavy machine guns, 21 vehicles, and many other military supplies were seized.
