　　Xigubi Transports and Makes Up for Grain Shortage
  　Eighty Thousand Yuan Earned in Twenty Days
    [Report from Benbao, Xiyang] After the autumn harvest in Xigubi, Fourth District, the masses began to waste food. Some people reflected, saying, "Whether we harvest or not, we have to eat for a whole autumn. This summer, we ate bran and tree leaves, suffering for two months. Now that the big autumn harvest is here, we must eat cornmeal wotou for a few days." After discovering this thought, a mass meeting was convened, and it was proposed that the autumn harvest was complete, the grain had been put in the warehouse, and everyone should look at the grain piles and compare them to last year. Are they bigger or smaller than last year? At this time, the masses started to discuss among themselves, calculating. After careful discussion and comparison, the whole village only had an average of 40% of a normal harvest this year, with a total of 2,281.9 mu of land, producing 1,140 shi, 9 dou, and 5 sheng of grain. This was one-third less than last year (last year's harvest was 1,743 shi, 2 dou, and 3 sheng). The whole village had 677 people, with each person eating an average of 5 he of grain per day (minimum living standard), totaling 1,218 shi, 1 dou, and 6 sheng per year. Subtracting the consumption, there was a grain deficit of 77 shi, 6 dou, and 5 sheng. Adding the 210 shi of burden and miscellaneous grains, the total grain deficit for the village was 287 shi, 6 dou, and 5 sheng, with an average net deficit of just over 4 dou and 2 sheng per person. After this calculation, the masses were awakened, realizing that not only could they not waste, but they also had to strengthen conservation. Li Tongxin said, "Just conserving without production means we won't survive the famine next year and will still go hungry. If we want to get through it, we have to find ways to make up for it. My family of four has 14 mu of land, and this year's harvest was 4 shi and 9 dou. After deducting public grain and miscellaneous expenses, each person eats an average of 5 he per day, leaving four months without food. The way I thought of making up for it is through transportation. I have a donkey, and I have already transported two times, walking for ten days, earning a total of 12,550 yuan, and buying 6 dou of millet. I plan to transport three more times, which will earn back my burden of 1 shi and 5 dou of grain. At the same time, there are two other households in my group that feed three donkeys, and we should help each other. This will save labor and earn more money, ensuring that we earn money this winter to buy grain and avoid being controlled next spring." After this speech, the masses began to discuss, each calculating their own possessions, and finally unanimously agreed that in addition to conservation, they should vigorously develop winter production (mainly transportation) to make up for this year's poor autumn harvest. Then, a one-month plan for the whole village was made. The village has 50 donkeys, each transporting four times per month, with each earning 2,000 yuan, totaling 400,000 yuan. However, according to the inspection within the first twenty days, 825,450 yuan has been earned, exceeding the original plan by one time. (Mang Xiao, Zhi Hong)

　　西固壁运输补缺粮
  　二十天赚钱八十万
    【本报昔阳讯】四区西固壁在秋收完毕后，群众开始了浪费，有些群众反映说：“收不收要吃一秋，今年夏天吃糠，吃树叶，苦了两个月，现在大秋下来啦，怎么也要吃几天玉茭面窝窝。”发现这种思想后，便召开了群众大会，提出了秋已收完，粮食已打到仓里，看看谷堆，比比去年，比去年大，还是比去年小？这时群众闲拉着讨论起来，都在计算，经过群众细密的讨论对比，全村今年平均只有四成年景，共有地二千二百八十一亩九分，共产粮一千一百四十石九斗五升，比去年少打三分之一（去年打粮一千七百四十三石二斗三升），全村人六百七十七口，每口人每天平均食粮五合（最低生活），全年共食一千二百一十八石一斗六升，除吃净亏粮七十七石六斗五升，再加上负担折杂粮二百一十石，全村总共亏粮二百八十七石六斗五升，每人平均净亏四斗二升强。经过这一计算，清醒了群众头脑，一致认识了不但不能浪费，还得加强节约。李同心说：“光节约不生产明年灾荒又渡不过去，还是饿肚，要想渡过去，就得想办法来补救，我全家四口人，种地十四亩，今年打粮四石九斗，除出公粮杂支外，每人每天平均吃五合，还有四个月没得吃。我想的办法是运输来补救，我有驴一头，现已运输了两回，走了十天，共赚洋一万二千五百五十元，籴下小米六斗，我计划再运三回，就能把我的一石五斗负担粮赚回来，同时我那组里还有两户喂三个毛驴，要和他们互助起来，一面能省工，又能多赚钱，保证今冬赚下钱，买下粮食，使明春不受制。”经过这一发言，群众展开了讨论，每个人都在计算自己的家当，最后一致同意：除节约外，要大力开展冬季生产（主要是运输），来补救今年的秋粮歉收。接着订出全村的一个月计划，全村有驴五十头，每月每头运输四回，每头每回赚洋两千元，共能赚洋四十万元。但到现在二十天内检查，能赚下洋八十二万五千四百五十元，超过原计划的一倍。（忙小、志鸿）
