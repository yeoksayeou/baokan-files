　　The Daying Fur Industry is Flourishing
[Report from this newspaper's Jinan office on the 22nd] The fur industry in Daying Town, Zaoqiang County, has begun to prosper in recent years with the cultivation of the government-run Huafeng Fur Depot. The fur shops on the streets that were destroyed by the enemy are being repaired or rebuilt. The signs of the fur shops are once again hanging full on the three streets. Bundles of fur are lined up, crowding the entrances and courtyards of each fur shop. The Huafeng Depot has successively established 22 tanned leather groups in the villages near Daying, with a total of more than 300 workers (including more than 20 female workers). Each group is given half of their work pay in rice in advance, with the most being 7,500 catties. The materials used are supplied by the depot. Each worker earns 5.5 catties of rice for shaving six hides. On average, a worker can do two units of work per day. The women's sheepskin mattress group in Louzi Village, with a total of eight people, earns 19 catties of rice for making one mattress. According to statistics from Yangbaitaa, Laoxiaoying, and Xishawo, five groups, this year they bought 11 and a half head of cattle, added 16 mu of land, raised two pigs, four sheep, and bought a windlass. This has not only enabled the nearly one thousand workers in the villages near Daying and Encha to improve their economic situation, but has also attracted many workers back from Tianjin and Beijing. In Lucun Village alone, more than 50 workers were attracted back in three months. Chen Wanmiao, a worker from Jiulusi, said after coming out of Beijing: "Working in Beijing and Tianjin means being beaten, abused, and not getting enough to eat, and sometimes even working for nothing. After coming to Daying, I received half of my wage in rice before I even started working, which solved the problem of my family's food shortage. The workers in the liberated areas and the workers in Beijing and Tianjin are truly worlds apart." After Huafeng held an election for model workers, the technology was further improved and the output increased even more. An old lady in her seventies from Xixiaoying said: "For many years, workers have been bullied, and they don't even get paid for their work. Now Huafeng has pulled us poor people out of the mud." This year, the tanned leather groups led by Huafeng alone produced 83,000 various hides. In addition to working, the tanned leather workers in Xishawo also hoed 210 mu of land for others, pulled wheat from 80 mu, made a profit of 1,215 yuan from raising pigs, accumulated 25 carts of fertilizer, and saved 97 catties of rice to support the front line. There is now one fur depot in Daying. In addition to the mass fur cooperatives, there are 22 private fur shops.
[Another dispatch] In Encha Town, the hat-making workshops have grown from 11 to 82 in five months, with more than 500 workers. A total of 200,000 hat bodies were produced this year, double the number from last year. The main reason is that Huafeng solved two major difficulties for the workshops: providing loans and raw materials to those without capital, and purchasing the finished products that cannot be sold. Huafeng has spent 349,600 catties of rice on transportation alone (fur accounts for 284,800 catties). Now, nearly a thousand workers in the vicinity of Daying and Encha Towns have moved from the poverty of wandering unemployment to the road of prosperity.

　　大营皮毛业繁荣
    【本报冀南二十二日电】枣强县大营镇皮毛业，年来在政府华丰皮毛货栈的培植下，已开始走向繁荣。街上被敌人拆毁的皮毛店房，都在着手修理或重建。皮店字号牌子，又重新挂满了三道街。皮毛捆一排排的挤满了每个皮店的门口和院子。华丰栈在大营附近村庄，先后成立了二十二个熟皮组，共有工人三百多个（内有女工二十余）。每组先发工米一半，最多的七千五百斤。所用材料，由货栈供给，每人铲六张皮算一工，得米五斤半。一般工人，每天平均能做两工的活。娄子村的妇女熟羊皮褥子组，共八人，做成一张褥子，即得工米十九斤。据杨白塔、老小营、西沙窝等五个组今年的统计，共买牛十一头半，添地十六亩，喂猪两口，羊四头，买风弓一架。这样不但使大营、恩察两镇附近近千的工人都得到了经济的上升，同时把平津的工人也拉回了许多。只鹿家屯一村，在三个月内，就拉回工人五十多名。旧路寺工人陈晚苗，由北平出来说：“在平津做工挨打受气吃不饱，有时还打空工；到大营以后，没做工先发给工资米一半，这样就能解决家里的吃饭困难。解放区的工人和平津工人，真是天上地下。”从华丰召开选举工人模范后，技术更为提高，产量更加增多。西小营一个七十多岁的老太太说：“多少年来，工人都是受气的，做了活还不给工钱。现在华丰家把俺穷人可从泥窝里拉出来了。”今年只华丰领导的熟皮组，即出品各种皮子八万三千张。西沙窝熟皮工人除做工外，还给人家锄地二百一十亩，拔麦子八十亩，养猪营利一千二百一十五元，积肥二十五车，节约米九十七斤，作为支援前线用。现大营已有皮毛货栈一家。除群众性的皮毛合作社外，私人皮店有二十二家。
    【又讯】恩察镇帽头作坊五个月的工夫，由十一家发展到八十二家，工人五百多名。今年全年共出帽头二十万顶，比去年增加一倍。主要是华丰给作坊解决了两大困难：没资本的贷给款，发给原料；做出成品出售不了，由华丰收买。只运输费，华丰即出米三四九六○○斤（皮毛占二八四八○○斤）；现大营、恩察两镇附近，近千名工人，由流浪失业的穷困，已走向发家致富的道路了。
