　　Peasants in Yantou Who Have Overturned Their Lives Pick Up Money and Do Not Pocket It
    [Report from She County] In the middle of last month, three comrades, Liu Tianlai, Yang Jingming, and Zhang Er'an, who were impoverished peasants from Yantou in the first district who had been emancipated, went to Henan Store to sell scallions at the market. On their way back, they found a bundle of banknotes at Weichiwan, totaling 243,120 yuan. They put it in their basket and carried it back home. Without eating, they ran to the village chief to report it. He said: "Village chief, you should quickly go to the police station to make a statement. The person who lost the money must be in trouble! If a private person lost it, it might cost them their life. If it was lost by public officials, then it will be our people who bear the burden." In the afternoon, Tian Zhiming from the Political Department's Communications Class came crying, and they handed over all the banknotes to Tian Zhiming. Tian was extremely grateful and said: "You villagers are so good. I will never forget you. I will definitely tell the leaders when I get back to reward you." (Wen Jie, Wen Liang, An Ji)

　　沿头翻身农民拾金不昧
    【本报涉县讯】上月中旬一区沿头翻身贫雇农民刘天来、杨景明、张二安三位同志来河南店赶集卖葱，回返时走到苇池湾，拾起款洋一捆，共二十四万三千一百廿元，放到箩头担回去，没有吃饭就跑到村长那里报告，他说：“村长你快去公安局派出所声明吧，掉款人可要作难哩！要是私人掉了，恐要出人命，如是公家人掉的那也是咱们群众负担。”到下午政治部通讯班田治明哭着找来了，当将款洋全交给田治明，田感激不尽的说：“老乡真好，啥时也忘不了你们，回去一定说给首长奖励你们。”（文杰、温良、安吉）
