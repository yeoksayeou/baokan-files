(Jilu-Yu-Henan Report from this newspaper on the 18th) Basic Experiences of Military Struggle in the Huxi Sub-region in One Year:

　　(1) The transition from peace to guerrilla warfare, from fear to fearlessness, is a very complex and difficult process. This is not something that can be achieved by persuasion and education in meetings. It requires strong leadership to persist in the strategy of fighting guerrilla warfare and defending the area. On the one hand, it is certainly necessary to patiently persuade cadres to understand this strategy. However, more importantly, cadres must experience it in practice, and their thinking can only be opened up in struggle. At first, the troops were afraid to fight against the Chiang bandits. After several battles, they all felt that the Chiang bandits were easier to fight than the local reactionary forces. When digging tunnels, they had no confidence, but later they all believed in the role of the tunnels. Many facts prove that in the initial stage, persistence mainly relies on the leadership having a firm and unwavering strategy. After persisting, they recognize the enemy and themselves in the struggle, know that the struggle can be sustained, and their confidence is enhanced.

　　(2) In military terms, we must be more tenacious than the enemy. If we can eliminate him, we will eliminate him. If we cannot eliminate him, we will drive him away. Through repeated back-and-forth battles, we gradually weaken the enemy. At the same time, in the gaps between these repeated battles, we seize the time to carry out land reform, build tunnels, and strike and suppress bad elements in order to control the rural areas. This gradually reduces the enemy's base of activity, and our struggle gradually gains the support of the masses. When the enemy has to admit that this area belongs to us, he will not dare to invade easily again, and the situation will be opened up. In areas that have already been ruled by the enemy, it is impossible to eliminate the enemy completely at once. We must not be eager for quick success. We must not be afraid of fatigue and must repeatedly raid and uproot their nests. Whoever can endure hardship will win. Our purpose in doing so is to seize opportunities for battle on the one hand, and to mobilize the masses on the other. At this time, local cadres must be dispersed and persistent, and must not squeeze together with the troops, otherwise it will create a target for the enemy's raids. If our actions are difficult and we cannot mobilize the masses in time, it will be difficult to gain a foothold. Last year, a certain regiment constantly annihilated the enemy on the borders of Feng, Shan, Jin, and Yu, but because it did not control the rural areas, it finally had to withdraw. After entering Huxi for the second time, the troops took advantage of every opportunity to annihilate the local bandits and reactionary forces. The local authorities carried out land reform, dug tunnels, and controlled the landlords, and as a result, they gained a foothold in twenty days. After we gain a foothold, it will be much easier to strike and eliminate the enemy.

　　(3) Resolve to persist independently and autonomously without relying on external assistance. Whether it is the army corps or the county and district armed forces, the main link in persisting in the struggle is to resolve this issue. Those who have resolved it will persist well and their combat effectiveness will improve quickly. Those who have not resolved it will show signs of retreat and the morale of the troops will be low. At the beginning, the armed forces of the sub-region and the local cadres had a serious mentality of relying on the troops to win the world. First, the sub-region clarified the idea of independent persistence, and then educated the troops. Originally, a certain regiment did not dare to fight against the enemy's main force. After resolving this idea, in the Weizhuang battle, one battalion annihilated one and a half companies of the enemy, and felt that they could also annihilate the enemy independently, and had confidence. The Ningnan Brigade resolved this problem, independently defeated a battalion of the enemy's 70th Division, persisted in the area, and supported the struggle in Jinxi and Shan County. The two counties of ×× and ×× still have a mentality of relying on external assistance to this day, their work is lagging behind, and their combat effectiveness cannot be improved. This shows that with determination there is victory. If there is no determination, no matter how many people there are, they will be useless. The more we fear the enemy, the more ferocious they will be. The harder we are, the more afraid the enemy will be of us.

　　(4) It is very important to clearly distinguish between merits and demerits, to carry out timely commendations, and to strictly enforce discipline. In the early stage of guerrilla warfare, a group of heroic and hard-working cadres who were truly unyielding in the face of difficulties emerged. At the same time, some cadres with "soft bone disease" were discovered who dared not face the enemy and sneaked away to Hebei. At this time, through merit and demerit checks, the good and the bad were clearly distinguished, and the retreating cadres were unceremoniously inserted back, especially the bad ones were punished, and the good ones were commended. This requires great courage on the part of the leadership. In the early stage of the war, when right-leaning sentiments were serious, several regimental-level cadres were dismissed and unqualified cadres were replaced, without regard for their history and dissatisfaction, because such consideration would ruin the work. After persisting, the emphasis was on commendation and reward, and as soon as something good was discovered, it was immediately commended and rewarded. Later, it proved that doing so played a great role.

　　(5) The leadership should be a model of persistence, and should promptly summarize experiences and point out directions. In the several most serious situations, the leading organs organized forces and took the lead in doing things, truly sharing weal and woe. The leaders of the prefectural committee and sub-region personally persisted, thought of more ways to support the lower-level cadres, enhanced the confidence of the lower-level cadres, and reduced mutual complaints. The withdrawal from the central area last year was also caused by the lack of leadership from the prefectural committee and sub-region leaders. In the course of persistence, because the situation has changed rapidly in the past year, much faster than during the Anti-Japanese War, it would not have been possible to persist without timely and rapid summarization of experiences. At the beginning, the emphasis was on opening up the situation through military struggle, but after many battles, it was still impossible to gain a foothold. An examination was immediately conducted to find the reason, which was mainly the failure to control the rural areas. It was decided to immediately carry out land reform and control the landlords, and the situation quickly opened up.

　　(6) The creativity of the troops is very great, and the leadership must believe in this point, so that they can give play to their creativity, and also be good at guiding and improving their creation. In the past, it was always thought that this troop could not fight, and that troop could not fight. Facts have proved that the combat effectiveness of many new troops is very good, and their achievements are beyond expectations. The problem is that the leadership does not dare to let go and let them take on tasks, and in this case, this creativity cannot be brought into play. The leadership must consciously use the newly grown troops from a developmental point of view, so that they can advance by leaps and bounds in combat.

　　湖西分区一年军事斗争基本经验
    【本报冀鲁豫河南十八日电】湖西分区一年军事斗争基本经验：
    （一）从和平到游击战，从恐惧到无畏，是一个非常复杂而艰难的转变过程。这不是在会议上用说服教育所能打通思想的，必须是领导上强力坚持打游击坚持地区的方针。一方面固然要耐心说服干部，使干部了解这一方针，然而，更重要的是在实际中使干部去体验，在斗争中才能打通思想。开始部队不敢和蒋匪作战，经过几次战斗之后，都认为蒋匪比土顽还好打；挖地道时，都没信心，以后都相信了地道的作用。许多事实都证明在初期的坚持，主要依靠领导上有坚定不移的方针，一坚持之后，在斗争中认识了敌人和自己，知道斗争是可以坚持的，信心就提高了。
    （二）军事上要和敌人比顽强，能够消灭就消灭他，不能消灭就挤跑他。经过反复拉锯，逐渐削弱敌人，同时在这反复拉锯的空隙中，抓紧进行土改、建设地道、打击和镇压坏蛋，以控制农村阵地，使敌人的活动基础逐渐减小，我们的斗争逐渐得到群众的支持，敌不得不承认这个地区已属于我们时，他就不敢再轻易进犯，局面就打开了。而在敌人已经统治了的地区，要想一下子把敌人消灭干净是不可能的，绝不能急于求胜，必须要不怕疲劳，反复奔袭、刨其巢穴，谁能熬过艰苦谁就能胜利。我们这样做的目的，一方面在于捕捉战机，一方面便于发动群众。这时，地方干部必须是分散坚持的，不能和部队挤到一块，否则就造成敌人奔袭目标。我行动不易又不能及时发动群众，就难以站住脚。去年某团在丰、单、金、鱼边不断歼灭敌人，但由于没有控制农村阵地，最后还是不得不退出；二次进入湖西后，部队利用一切机会歼灭土杂顽，地方上搞土改、挖地道、控制地主，结果二十天站稳了脚，等我们站住脚之后，再去打击和消灭敌人，就比较容易多了。
    （三）决心独立自主的坚持而不依赖外援。坚持斗争的主要环节，不论兵团和县区武装，解决了这一问题的，坚持的就好、战斗力提高的就快；没有解决的，就表现退缩，部队情绪不高。开始，分区武装和地方干部依赖部队打天下思想很严重。首先分区明确了独立坚持的思想，然后教育部队。原来某团不敢和敌主力作战，解决这一思想后，魏庄战斗中一个营歼敌一个半连，觉得自己也能单独歼灭敌人，有信心了。宁南大队解决了这一问题，单独击溃敌七十师一个营，坚持了地区，并支援金西、单县的斗争。××和××两县，到今天还有依靠外援心理，工作落后了，战斗力不能提高。这里说明有决心就有胜利；如果没有决心，再多的人也无用，我们越怕敌人就越凶，我们一硬敌人就怕我们。
    （四）要功过分明，及时进行表扬，严格执行纪律，是很重要的。游击战的初期，涌现了一批英勇奋斗、艰苦奋斗真正临难不苟的干部，同时也发现了一些害软骨病的干部，不敢面向敌人，偷偷溜遁河北。这时通过功过检查，把好的与坏的划分清楚，不客气的使那些退却的干部插回来，特别坏的受了处分，好的进行了表扬，这是必须要领导上有极大魄力的。在战争初期，右倾情绪严重时，撤职了几个营级干部，调换了不称职的干部，没有顾惜他们的历史和不满，因为顾惜，那就会把工作搞垮，在坚持之后，就着重了表扬和奖励，发现一点好的东西马上就表扬和奖励。后来证明这样做起了很大作用。
    （五）领导上要做坚持的楷模，要及时总结经验指出方向，在几次局面最严重时，领导机关组织力量，带头去干，真正甘苦与共，地委分区领导人亲自坚持，给下级多想办法撑腰，提高了下级干部的信心，减少了互相埋怨，而在去年退出中心区，也是由于地委分区领导同志带头不够所引起的。在坚持中，由于一年来的情况变化很快，比抗日时期变化快的多，如不是及时迅速总结经验，就坚持不下来。开始时强调以军事斗争打开局面，但经过多次战斗后，仍站不住脚，即进行了检讨找到原因，主要是没有控制农村阵地，决定立即搞土改控制地主，局面即迅速打开。
    （六）部队的创造力是很大的，领导上必须相信这一点，使其发挥创造性，而且要善于诱导提高其创造。过去总认为这个部队不能打仗，那个部队不能打仗，事实证明，许多新部队的战斗力都很好，他们的战绩是出于预料之外的；问题是在于领导上不敢放手，让他们担负任务的情况下，这种创造力就不得发挥。领导上必须有意识的从发展的观点上使用新生长起来的部队，使其在战斗中大步前进。
