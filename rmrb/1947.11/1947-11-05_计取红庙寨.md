　　In September night, our Sixth Company and a platoon of the Fifth Company, marched fifty li. On the road, we met a member of the puppet district headquarters, who said, "Go ahead and attack, my men haven't settled into good houses yet, they just moved here." Such enemies didn't even dare to stay in one place at midnight, fearing us so much even forty or fifty li away.

　　Approaching Hongmiaozhai, the enemy asked, "Who's there?" We replied: "We are from the 68th Division, coming from east of Dingtao. The 68th Division was defeated and it took us several days to get here."

　　The enemy wanted to check by phone. Comrade Liu Benchen said, "Don't call, the phone is dead." The enemy immediately fired a shot, and our soldiers shouted in unison, "We are the 68th Division, if you fire again, we'll open fire with artillery!" The enemy couldn't figure out the truth and didn't dare to fire again. Xiao Zhang, a newly liberated soldier from Sichuan, cursed even louder. The enemy was both afraid and surprised, one person came to negotiate, and the others took the opportunity to escape. Hongmiaozhai, a place occupied by the enemy police station for four months, was taken by us after only one shot.

　　The telephone bureau chief of the enemy in Kaocheng called, and Comrade Liu Benchen started talking to him. He asked about the situation, and we told him about the Sha Tuj village battle where we annihilated the 57th Division: we said the People's Liberation Army had already reached Heicunji, please come and assist quickly. This Chiang bandit's Bureau Chief Wang hurriedly replied, "Don't you know? There's only one battalion here, can't go, can't go!"

　　Our mission was completed. Before leaving, we set fire to the police station, and smoke filled the sky.

    计取红庙寨
    葛子兰  成希泉    
    九月的夜晚，我们六连和五连的一个排，五十里地远地奔袭；路上碰见了伪区部的一个人，他说：“你们打吧，俺的人还没住好房子，刚移到这里。”这样的敌人都是半夜还不敢住一个地方，离我们四五十里，就害怕到这种程度。
    接近红庙寨，敌人问：“干啥的？”我们回答是：六十八师的，从定陶以东来，六十八师被打垮了走了几天才到这里。
    敌人要用电话问问。我刘本：臣同志说别打了，电话不通了。敌人马上打了一枪，我们的战士齐声大骂：“我们是六十八师，你再打就用炮打开你！”敌人弄不清虚实，也不敢再打了。新解放的战士小张是四川人，骂得更欢。敌人又怕又惊，一个人来交涉，其他的就趁此逃走。红庙寨是敌人警察所盘据四个月的地方，只打了一枪就被我们取下了。
    考城敌人的电话局长打来了电话，刘本臣同志就跟他讲起话来，他问情况，我们就把这次沙土集战役消灭五十七师的情形告诉他：我们说解放军已经到了黑村集，请你们快来援助，这位蒋匪的汪局长急忙答道：“你们还不知道吗？这里只有一个营，不能去，不能去！”
    我们任务已经完成，临走，放火烧了警察所，烟火弥漫在天空。
