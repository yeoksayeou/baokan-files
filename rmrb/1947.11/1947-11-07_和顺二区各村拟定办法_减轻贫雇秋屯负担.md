    [This newspaper, Taihang 4th dispatch] HeShun, in the autumn grain collection, paid attention to solving the difficulties of poor and hired masses in handing over grain. The county government, in order to take care of the poor and hired in the autumn collection, issued instructions stipulating that: the extremely poor and hired laborers should bear 50% of the actual grain yield; poor peasants should bear 70%. However, in the implementation, it failed to be thoroughly realized. For example, in Xiashile Village, Second District, only 5 households out of 30 newly emancipated poor and hired households were taken care of. The reason was that the main cadres were afraid of increasing the burden on other classes. In villages such as Sancishezhang and Xia Huangyan, this situation also existed. After the district leadership understood the above situation, on October 10th, it convened a political director meeting of nine villages in the Liyang joint defense area. At the meeting, it first introduced the good practices and criticized the bad ones. For example, the practices of Nanbei Liyang and QinJiazhuang were: first, classify classes in the Farmers' Association, and after everyone's approval, determine who is a middle peasant, poor peasant, or hired peasant, and then provide appropriate care. The other villages, such as Xiashile, also made conscious self-criticisms, making everyone realize the importance of classifying components and how to follow the class line. After discussion and research, the following methods for classifying components were initially derived: (1) Those who were poor and hired before land reform should be taken care of; (2) Those who had become middle peasants before land reform should not be taken care of; (3) If they were feudal rich peasants who had lived without labor for three or five years and had fallen to the level of poor and hired before land reform, they should not be taken care of; (4) Degraded rich peasants and landlords who had been struggled against should not be taken care of.

    [This newspaper, Licheng News] In the autumn plowing mutual aid in Taibei Village, it was discovered that the poor peasant Zhang LianSuo did not harvest enough grain this autumn to pay the burden. The political director and the village head convened a meeting of all the poor and hired peasants in the village to discuss the matter. First, they learned that out of the 56 poor and hired households in the village, 5 households did not harvest a single grain, 19 households had enough to pay half of the burden, and 29 households could afford to pay the entire burden. Among the 56 households, only 3 households had a little surplus grain (unhusked millet) besides paying the burden. This year's payment of the burden must ensure that the liberated peasants in the whole village do not lack a single grain of miscellaneous grain. Wang Shoufa said: "We are all people who have been exploited and oppressed by landlords. Which one of us didn't get liberated until the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army came? We should help and adjust each other, hand over the anti-aggression grain, and then organize production to make up for this hole." In the time it took to smoke a few cigarettes, 24 large stones of grain were borrowed. Finally, everyone proposed to organize into teams to fill the hole, with men engaged in transportation and women engaged in weaving, to ensure that every household has enough to wear and eat.

    和顺二区各村拟定办法
    减轻贫雇秋屯负担
    【本报太行四日电】和顺，在秋季征粮中，注意了解决贫雇群众交粮困难。县府为了在秋征中照顾贫雇，曾发出指示规定：赤贫、雇工按实产粮分数百分之五十负担；贫农按百分之七十负担。但在执行中，未能贯澈实现。如二区下石勒村，全村有三十户新翻身的贫雇，只照顾了五户，原因是主要干部怕加重了其它阶层负担。三寺掌，下黄岩等村，均有这种情形。该区领导上了解以上情况后，十月十号在李阳联防召开了九个村的政治主任会议，会上首先介绍了好的，批判了坏的。如南北李阳，琴家庄的做法是：在农会中先划阶级，经大家批准，谁是中农、贫农、雇农，再作适当的照顾，做的较好。其它下石勒等村，亦均作了自觉的检讨，使大家认识了划成份的重要，与如何走级阶路线。经过讨论研究，初步得出以下几个划成份办法：（一）土改前是贫雇者照顾；（二）土改前已变成中农者，不照顾；（三）如系封建富农，自己曾不劳而活三年或五年，在土改前，下降为贫雇层者，不照顾；（四）被斗过的下降富农、地主均不照顾。
    【本报黎城讯】台北村，在互助秋耕中，发现贫农张连锁今年秋季打谷不够交负担，政治主任与村长便召开全村贫雇农会议商讨，首先了解全村共五十六户贫雇农中，没打一粒谷的即有五户，够交一半负担者有十九户，能全部够交负担者二十九户，五十六户中只有三户除交负担外稍有余粮（谷）。今年交负担要保证全村翻身农民不少一粒杂粮，王守法说：“咱们都是受过地主剥削压迫的人，咱这伙人，那个不是共产党八路军来才翻了身，咱们应该互相帮助调剂，将反攻粮交了，再组织起来生产来弥补这个窟窿”。几袋烟工夫调借出二十四大石谷，最后大家提出按组队组织起来填窟窿，男人搞运输，妇女闹纺织，保证家家不缺穿和吃。（怀璧）
