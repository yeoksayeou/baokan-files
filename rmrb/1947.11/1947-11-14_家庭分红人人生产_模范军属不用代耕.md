　　【Report from Jinnan, November 12th by our Newspaper】Hengshui Beizeng Village's model military dependent, Geng Huichen, implements family production dividends. His family does all of its own work and needs no substitute farming. Geng is from a poor peasant background, with a family of eight and thirty-eight mu of land. His family's work is divided according to the family's population through division of labor and mutual assistance, and a reward system is implemented. Based on age, the amount of work done, and the difficulty of the work, a family meeting is held at the end of each month to evaluate and summarize, and funds are distributed and red marks are given. The whole family's production enthusiasm is very high. Therefore, the family can handle all the work and does not allow the village to provide substitute farming. When the masses want to help him with his work, he always refuses, saying, "If my family can do the work, we will do it ourselves. If we can't do it, we will come to you." His family resolutely refuses to let the preferential treatment and resistance group carry water for them. The preferential treatment and resistance group hid the buckets so that he could not carry them himself and insisted on carrying water for him. Afterwards, he said at the meeting: "My family has people to do it, you can help those who don't have people." The masses often say behind his back: "We really feel bad if we don't work for Huichen's family." This autumn, in order to quickly harvest the autumn crops and plant wheat early, Huichen harvested two mu of sorghum ahead of schedule. Before Huichen's family knew, the preferential treatment and resistance group picked up the stalks and sent them to his home. Huichen was very grateful and squeezed out time to help others with their work. He saw that Zhang Wenquan's mother was a cripple and needed help with her work, so he plowed her one and a half mu of land and planted wheat, saying, "If anyone has difficulties, come to me, I will definitely find a way to help you." The masses all support him very much, and everyone calls him a "model military dependent."

　　家庭分红人人生产
    模范军属不用代耕
    【本报冀南十二日电】衡水北增庄模范抗属耿惠臣实行家庭生产分红。自家的活全部做过来，不用代耕。耿系贫农成份，人八口，地三十八亩。他家的活按照全家的人口分工互助，并实行奖励办法，按年岁大小，做活多少、活轻重、每月底全家会议评判总结一次，进行分款批红，全家生产情绪十分高涨。因此，全家一切活都作得过来，不让村里代耕优待。群众要帮着他做活的时候，他总推说：“我家里能做了的活，就自家做，做不了时，再去找你们吧。”他家坚决不让优抗组给担水。优抗组把水桶藏起来，不让他自己担，坚决给他担水。事后他就在开会时说：“我家里有人做，你们可以帮助没有人的。”群众背他常说：“咱不给惠臣家干活，真过意不去”，今年秋天惠臣为了快收秋早种麦，提早把二亩高粱收割后，优抗组没等惠臣家知道，就拾了茬子送到他家去了。惠臣很感激遂挤出工夫帮助旁人做活。他见到张文拳的母亲是个拐子，家里需要人做活，他便把她的一亩半地耕好给种上了麦子，并说：“谁有困难就找我，我一定想法给你们办。”群众都十分护拥，人人称他为“模范抗属”。
