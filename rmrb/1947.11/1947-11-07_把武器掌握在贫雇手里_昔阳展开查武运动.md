    Putting Weapons in the Hands of Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants
    Xiyang Launches a Weapons Investigation Campaign
    [This newspaper Xiyang News] To protect the thorough emancipation of peasants and put guns in the hands of the poor and lower-middle peasants, Xiyang County has launched a weapons investigation campaign, inspiring the poor and lower-middle peasants' armed self-awareness and boldly developing the poor and lower-middle peasant militia. In Mengbiao Village, Sixth District, during the weapons investigation, a farmers' association discussion was held, raising the questions: Is the people's armed force important? Whose armed force is it? Who can join the militia? After discussion, it was clarified that the militia is to protect the peasants' own emancipation interests, and seven emancipated poor and lower-middle peasant youths immediately signed up to join the militia. In Dongzhang, Tianshengmiao, Yuzhang and other villages in the Fourth District, after the launch of the weapons investigation campaign, seventy-nine young emancipated peasants have successively developed and joined their own armed forces, driving out seven feudal landlords. Nanzhuang in the Fifth District started by investigating cadres, expelling the deputy director Zhao Yubao and other four bad militiamen who were consistently corrupt, degenerate, and hooligans. Within two days, sixteen emancipated youths were successively developed, and it was clearly proposed to hold the gun in the hands of our poor and lower-middle peasants. He Xia in the Fifth District began to investigate weapons, conducting discussions within the Farmers' Association, putting forward the slogan: "Draw a clear line between classes, recognize the enemy and ourselves, and do not allow feudal elements to mix into our own armed forces." After discussion, Chen Gui, Wang Wuhuai and other seven feudal landlords were immediately squeezed out, and emancipated peasants Liu Laicheng (over forty years old), Guo Yuliang and other five people joined their own armed forces.
