Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st—According to a report by an Associated Press reporter from Shanghai on the 29th: Since the Chiang Kai-shek bandit "Ministry of Interior" declared the Democratic League an "illegal organization," the Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities have ordered the closure and "takeover of the two buildings of the Democratic League's Shanghai headquarters on Rue Massenet and Rue Chu Pao San." Democratic League members in major cities are now completely under the surveillance of Chiang's special agents. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit "Ministry of Interior" has ordered Democratic League members in Chiang-controlled areas and groups related to the Democratic League to "register" and renounce the Democratic League with the Chiang Kai-shek authorities by the end of November, in accordance with the bloody "Regulations for Handling Communists in the Rear," or face fascist measures. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit headquarters in Chongqing has also issued a similar order. According to Associated Press, Nanjing: Huang Yanpei, one of the leaders of the Democratic League, went to Nanjing from Shanghai on the 30th to meet with Chiang Kai-shek's "Executive Yuan" President Zhang Qun to protest the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's persecution of the Democratic League and demand the removal of the Chiang Kai-shek police and special agents' surveillance of the Democratic League headquarters, but Zhang Qun did not give a clear answer.

Observers believe that Chiang Kai-shek's declaration of the Democratic League as illegal, like his intensified massacre of the Chinese people, is executing the orders of his American masters. Before Chiang Kai-shek declared the Democratic League "illegal," he consulted his master, American imperialism. According to Associated Press, Washington, on the 30th, authoritative sources told the agency's reporter: "Washington has recently received notification of Chiang Kai-shek's government's plan to take certain actions against the Democratic League." Chiang Kai-shek's declaration of the Democratic League as "illegal" immediately received explicit support from American officials. According to United Press and Associated Press, Nanjing: Luo Longji, a spokesman for the Democratic League, visited US Ambassador Stuart on the 28th, intending to inform him of the Chiang government's closure of the Democratic League, but Stuart claimed to be ill and refused to meet him. Subsequently, Stuart and the US Embassy Counselor visited Chiang Kai-shek's "Foreign Minister" Wang Shijie to "discuss" the Democratic League issue. According to Agence France-Presse, Washington, after receiving Stuart's report, the US State Department formally denied on the 29th that Democratic League leaders had sought refuge in the US Embassy. After the Democratic League was declared "illegal" by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, William C. Bullitt, former US ambassador to the Soviet Union and warmonger, gave a radio speech on the 30th, supporting Chiang Kai-shek's measures and slandering the Democratic League, saying that "declaring the Democratic League illegal is because it is merely the tail of the Communist Party."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd—"Democracy will ultimately triumph in China," was the answer of Zhang Lan, Chairman of the Democratic League, when asked by an Associated Press reporter if he was worried about his safety. According to an Associated Press reporter from Shanghai on the 31st: Zhang Lan, the respected 74-year-old, is still staying in his Shanghai residence with his beloved daughter and two Democratic League members. He willingly posed for reporters who requested a photograph and revealed that the Chiang Kai-shek authorities have ordered him not to go out.

    蒋匪横暴摧残民盟
    也是执行美帝命令
    张澜坚信民主终必胜利
    【新华社陕北一日电】据美联社记者二十九日自上海报导：自蒋匪内政部宣布民盟为“非法团体”后，蒋匪当局已命令封闭并“接管民盟上海总部在马思南路及朱葆三路两幢房屋”。各大城市民盟盟员，已完全处于蒋特监视下，蒋匪内政部已下令蒋区民盟盟员及与民盟有关社团依照血腥的“后方共产党处置办法”，于十一月底向蒋匪当局“登记”自首，脱离民盟，否则即以法西斯手段对付。重庆蒋贼行辕亦已颁布同样命令。据美联社南京讯：民盟领袖之一黄炎培于三十日由沪赴京会晤蒋匪行政院长张群，抗议蒋匪迫害民盟，要求取消蒋记警察特务对民盟总部之监视，但张贼未予明确答复。
    观察家相信：蒋贼之宣布民盟非法，和他加紧屠杀中国人民一样，都是在执行其美国主子的命令。蒋贼在宣布民盟“非法”前，事先曾征求其主子美帝国主义意见，据美联社华盛顿三十日电，权威方面告该社记者：“最近华盛顿方面已接到关于蒋介石政府将计划某种行动以对付民盟之通知”。蒋贼宣布民盟“非法”后，立即获得美国官方明显的支持。据合众及美联社南京电称：民盟发言人罗隆基二十八日往访美大使司徒雷登，欲告以蒋政府封闭民盟一事，司徒竟称病不予接见，随后司徒却与美大使馆参赞一同往访蒋匪外交部长王世杰“商谈”民盟问题。另据法新社，自华盛顿报导，美国务院在接获司徒雷登的报告后，于二十九日正式否认民盟领袖曾避难于美国大使馆中。在民盟被蒋匪宣布为“非法”之后，美前驻苏法大使，战争贩子布立特即于卅日发表广播讲演，拥护蒋贼之措施，对民盟横加诬蔑，说什么“宣布民盟非法，乃因它仅是共产党的尾巴。”
    【新华社陕北二日电】“民主终将在中国得到胜利，”这是民盟主席张澜当美联社记者询问他耽不耽心他的安全时之回答。据美联社记者三十一日自上海报导：张澜这位受人尊敬的七十四岁的老人，刻仍与其爱女及两位民盟盟员同留上海寓所中，他很愿意地为要求摄影的记者作了一个姿势。并透露蒋匪当局已下令禁止他外出。
