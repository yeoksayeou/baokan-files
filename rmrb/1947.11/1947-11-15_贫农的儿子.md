　　The Poor Peasant's Son
　　Xing Chongzhi
　　I was born into a poor peasant's family.
　　Lacking housing, even more so land.
　　My father and two older brothers went to the landlords' homes,
　　Living as long-term laborers, monthly laborers, short-term laborers,
　　All to pay interest to the landlords.
　　When the twelfth month arrived,
　　The landlord's lackeys also came to our home to demand debts,
　　My father secretly ran away to hide;
　　In the harvesting autumn,
　　The landlords rode on mules fattened by the blood and sweat of the masses,
　　Taking their peck measures to come and collect rent;
　　The whole family, big and small, surrounded him pleading for him to consider their plight,
　　He said there was a lot of chaff in the grain, it all had to go through the winnowing fan.
　　Day after day passed like this,
　　Oweing the landlord countless rent and interest,
　　Finally, my father had to sell our only three rooms of house,
　　The whole family, big and small, blocked him,
　　But what could he do?
　　When writing the document, he asked me about the word "wall",
　　I scribbled all over it for him,
　　In my childish heart I thought,
　　That way, even if it's sold, it won't count as evidence,
　　But what good could that do?
　　The year before the incident,
　　My father ran away to Shanxi to escape debts.
　　My two older brothers went to hoe the almost barren rented land every day,
　　I went home to cook, boiling the water in the pot,
　　Seeing the rice jar bare at the bottom,
　　Thinking of these difficult days,
　　When will they ever pass?
　　That day finally arrived, it was '37,
　　The Eighth Route Army came here,
　　We took back the document, demanded back the land,
　　Land reform also divided us nine mu and one fen of land,
　　And three good rooms of house;
　　The poor people stood up themselves,
　　I am with the poor people,
　　I have been nurtured by the Communist Party since I was little,
　　The Party is my father and mother, I am the Party's son.

　　贫农的儿子
    邢崇智
     我生长在一个贫农的家里。
     缺少房屋，更没有土地。
     父亲和两个哥哥到地主们家里去，
     住长工、住月工、打短工，
     为着给地主上利。
     腊月来到了，
     要帐的狗腿们也来到我们家里，
     父亲偷偷跑在外面躲避；
     在收获的秋天，
     地主们骑上用着群众血汗喂胖的骡子，
     拿着他们的加三斗要来收刮租子；
     全家大小围在圈边央告他看看面子，
     他说谷里秕子多，都还要经过簸箕。
     这样一天天过去，
     欠下地主数不清的租子和利钱，
     最后父亲还得卖掉仅有的三间房子，
     全家大小在他面前阻拦着，
     但他有什么法子？
     写文书时他问我一个“墙”字，
     我就给他乱画一起，
     在我那小孩的心里想着，
     这样就是卖了也不算凭据，
     但又能顶什么事？
     事变前一年，
     父亲为了躲帐跑到了山西。
     两个哥哥每天去锄快荒了的租地，
     我去家里做饭，烧开了锅里的水，
     一看米缸露着底子，
     想到这样的艰难的日子，
     啥时候才能过去？
     这日子终于来到了，那是三七年，
     八路军来到这里，
     我们抽回了文书，要回了土地，
     土地改革又分给我们九亩一分地，
     还有三间好房子；
     穷人自己站了起来，
     我和穷人在一起，
     我从小受了共产党的抚育，
     党是爹娘，我是党的儿子。
