    Taihang Second District Office Issues Circular Commending
    Yuci's Victory in Protecting Autumn Harvest and Grain
    Lingshi Combines Labor and Arms for Rapid Harvesting, Fighting, and Storage
    [Report from this newspaper] The Taihang Second District Office recently issued a circular commending Yuci for its victory in the struggle to protect the autumn harvest and grain this autumn. The circular pointed out: In the struggle to divide fields, protect the autumn harvest, and protect fields this autumn, the military and civilians of Yuci unanimously grasped the principle of striking first, organized rear labor and animal power to support the border areas, and the militia went deep behind enemy lines to carry out the "flying thunder" movement. Mines bloomed everywhere behind enemy lines and near enemy strongholds, achieving armed cover, government support, and mass action, all three working together. After twenty days of struggle, the tasks of dividing the autumn harvest, dividing fields, dividing grain, protecting grain, and storing grain in the border areas were victoriously completed. Special commendation is hereby given. The circular finally emphasized: In future struggles against the enemy, we must not be arrogant or complacent, and must recognize the long-term nature of Yan Xishan's persistent grain grabbing. We must learn from the past lesson of being tight at first and then slack, continue to mobilize the masses to thoroughly empty houses and clear the fields, carry out the grain protection struggle throughout the year, and further launch active struggles to severely strike Yan Xishan's stubborn elements at any time, smash the enemy's grain grabbing conspiracy, and defend our lifeline.

    [Report from this newspaper, Taiyue, 5th] Lingshi strengthens the combination of labor and arms, achieving rapid harvesting, fighting, and storage. In the Third District, villages have formed 151 mutual aid groups for rushing harvesting and planting on the principle of voluntary combination. They carry out harvesting and planting day and night. Armed personnel form several groups, bringing two "pieces of furniture" to the fields – sickles and guns. When Yan bandits are discovered, they immediately pick up their guns to fight. In addition, they are stepping up grain storage. Through everyone's efforts, they have created various methods: One village, five miles from a stronghold, has every household heating their kangs (traditional heated brick beds) to dry the grain quickly and put it into underground cellars. Some even fry the corn and store it, not fearing spoilage, and then gradually transfer it to the rear for storage. All guerrilla units and armed work teams have recently become more active, covering everyone's autumn harvest and grain storage. On the 16th, thirty-odd Yan bandits came to Nan Yuan and were digging open cellars to pour in grain when our armed work team discovered them and immediately gave them a head-on blow. The Yan bandits fled in panic, three were injured by falls, and the rest fled back to the Jingsheng stronghold in a sorry state.
    [Report from this newspaper, Taiyue, 5th] After the seven Yan bandit detachments organized by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in Linfen were wiped out by us in Xiangling, they have shrunk back into Linfen,不敢出犯 unable to commit further offenses. Recently, in order to solve their food panic, they again formed a grain grabbing team of sixty-odd reactionary landlords, despots, and secret agents. On the evening of the 26th, they tentatively tried to grab grain from Zhaijiazhuang, thirty miles southeast of Linfen. The next day at dawn, they were surrounded by our local armed forces and pursued to Diantou Village in Xiandi Town, where they were completely annihilated. In addition to those killed and wounded, forty-three were captured alive, and three light machine guns, one small cannon, and thirty-nine rifles were seized.
