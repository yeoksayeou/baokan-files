　　New Artillery Battalion Established in the Jin-Lu-Yu Region
  　Guns and Instructors All from Chiang's Side
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu, 11th] The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region recently established a new artillery battalion. The battalion's XX cannons and modern equipment were all seized from Chiang's army. The thirteen artillery instructors are also former artillery officers who served in Chiang's army for many years. After being captured and studying for several months, they realized that they should dedicate their skills to the people and voluntarily requested to join the People's Liberation Army. One of the battalion's instructors, Xie Guoli, the former lieutenant platoon leader of the mountain artillery battalion of the 55th Division of Chiang's army, said: "I was confused for many years, and now I have finally found the right path. I am determined to serve the people wholeheartedly and overthrow Chiang Kai-shek, who slaughters the people."
