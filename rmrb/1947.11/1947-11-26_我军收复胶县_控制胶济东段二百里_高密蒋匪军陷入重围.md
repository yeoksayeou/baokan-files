Xinhua News Agency, East China, 24th—The People’s Liberation Army recovered Jiaoxian City, a strategic point in the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway, at 3 p.m. on the 21st, and the defending enemy all fled eastward. Thus, except for the isolated city of Gaomi, more than 200 li of the Jiaoji Railway from Fangzi, east of Weixian in the west, to the east bank of the Gu River, east of Jiaoxian, are now entirely under our control. The enemy troops defending Gaomi have fallen into an encirclement. Jiaoxian was occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits on August 5th and became one of the bases for Chiang Kai-shek's bandits to attack Jiaodong at that time. After the Jiao River battle on October 9th, Chiang Kai-shek's 9th Reorganized Division fled to the area along Jiaoxian and Gaomi. Since the 6th of this month, after the People's Liberation Army blocked and routed five and a half brigades of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits fleeing west along the Gaomi-Weixian line, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits were forced to turn around and flee east. The People's Liberation Army launched a pursuit on the 13th, advancing 60 li overnight, directly approaching Gaomi City. Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, in a state of panic, were attacked from three sides and continued to flee eastward in a panic. The People's Liberation Army followed and pursued them, annihilating more than 3,000 Chiang Kai-shek bandits by the 17th. On the 21st, the People's Liberation Army advanced further to Jiaoxian City, and Chiang Kai-shek's bandits hurriedly abandoned the city and fled. As for the remnants of the miscellaneous troops of the 64th Reorganized Division and the "Home Return Corps" left behind by the 9th Reorganized Division to resist the People's Liberation Army, they are now still entrenched in the isolated city of Gaomi because they failed to escape in time.

　　我军收复胶县
  　控制胶济东段二百里
  　高密蒋匪军陷入重围
    【新华社华东二十四日电】解放军二十一日下午三时收复胶济路东段战略要地胶县城，守敌全部东窜。至此，胶济路西起潍县以东之坊子，东迄胶县以东之沽河东岸二百余里，除高密一座孤城外，已全部为我控制。高密守敌已陷入重围。按胶县系于八月五日为蒋匪侵占，成为当时蒋匪向胶东进攻基地之一。十月九日，胶河大战后，蒋匪整九师即逃踞该地及胶、高沿线。自本月六日起，解放军在高潍一线堵截西逃蒋匪五个半旅并将其击溃后，蒋匪被迫扭头东窜，解放军于十三日发起追击，一夜东进六十里，直逼高密城下。蒋匪惊魂未定，又遭三面夹击，乃继续狼狈东逃，解放军跟踪追击，至十七日止，前后歼灭蒋匪共达三千余名。二十一日，解放军又进迫胶县城，蒋匪乃慌忙弃城而逃。至于被整九师留置后尾抵挡解放军的杂牌军整六十四师残部及“还乡团”等，因逃走不及，现仍龟缩于高密孤城。
