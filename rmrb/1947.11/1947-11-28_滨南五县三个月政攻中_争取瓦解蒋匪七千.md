　　Xinhua News Agency, East China, 24th: In the past three months (August, September, and October), five counties in Southern Bin (Hai) -- Zhuting (formerly Ganyu), Tancheng, Donghai, Linyi, and Linshu (newly established county) -- launched a powerful political offensive, winning over and disintegrating 7,320 Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops (including 1,149 Chiang Kai-shek regular soldiers), who also brought some weapons. In particular, since the national counter-offensive, the counties of Southern Bin have continuously carried out propaganda offensives, and, centering on the Mid-Autumn Festival, combined with a comprehensive military attack, they launched a political offensive blitz week, which has made the bandits and puppet troops in Southern Bin extremely panic-stricken, and soldiers are deserting in large numbers. In Tancheng, in the 62nd Brigade of Chiang Kai-shek's 83rd Division alone, more than 300 soldiers deserted in just two days, October 18th and 19th. According to statistics from the four reception centers for Chiang's army defectors in the county, they received more than 200 Chiang's army deserters in September and October. Other effective methods included Zhuting's propaganda station for Chiang's army, Linshu's propaganda shed and "save-your-life group," Linyi's propaganda team, and Donghai's "letter-writing campaign," all of which have yielded great results. Effective methods tested during the political offensive in Southern Bin include: 1. Universally convene mass meetings in newly recovered areas to explain the various policies of the liberated areas, especially emphasizing the land reform policy, introducing the circumstances of the people in the liberated areas who have turned over a new leaf, and distribute a large number of slogans and declarations of the CCP Central Committee and the People's Liberation Army on the current situation, demonstrating our magnanimous attitude and exposing the deceitful propaganda of the Chiang bandits with concrete crimes. 2. After mass discussions, create a list of life and death and a list of red and black, warning those who continue to do evil, welcoming those who repent and start anew, and attacking those who are incorrigible. 3. Combine land reform, anti-reckoning, anti-conscription, and anti-plunder struggles in the border areas to create a mass movement to disintegrate the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops. For poor and hired peasants who are coerced into becoming puppet and stubborn elements, after returning home, they will still be distributed the land and floating wealth they deserve.

　　滨南五县三个月政攻中
    争取瓦解蒋匪七千
    【新华社华东二十四日电】滨（海）南竹庭（赣榆改名）郯城、东海、临沂、临沭（新设县）五县八、九、十三个月内发动强大政治攻势，争取与瓦解蒋伪七千三百二十名（内有蒋匪正规军一千一百四十九名），并带来武器一部，特别是全国大反攻以来，滨南各县连续开展宣传攻势，并以旧历中秋节为中心结合全面军事出击，进行政攻突击周，更使滨南匪伪极度恐慌，士兵大批逃亡，郯城蒋匪整八三师六二旅，仅十月十八、十九两日内即逃亡三百余名。据该县四个蒋军来归招待所，统计九、十两月即收容蒋军逃兵二百余名。他如竹庭之对蒋军宣传站，临沭的宣传棚，救命小组，临沂的宣传队，东海的一封信运动，均收到很大效果。滨南政攻中试行有效的方式有：一、对新收复区普遍召开群众大会，讲解解放区各种政策，尤应着重讲解土改政策，介绍解放区人民翻身情形，大量散发中共中央与人民解放军时局口号、宣言等，表明我之宽大态度，以蒋匪具体罪行揭露其欺骗宣传。二、经群众讨论出生死榜与红黑榜，警告继续作恶者，欢迎改过自新者，打击顽固不化者。三、结合边缘区土改、反倒算、反抓丁、反抢掠斗争造成群众性的瓦解蒋伪运动。对被胁迫干伪顽之贫雇分子，回家后仍分与应得土地及浮财。
