Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 19th – After Shijiazhuang was liberated by our army, the Yan bandit of Taiyuan was extremely terrified. He is now extensively drafting soldiers and heavily levying the citizens in an attempt to prolong his survival. Recently, the people are in a state of panic, and prices continue to soar. Citizens are secretly trying to escape to the liberated areas. According to Tian Peiji, a businessman from the city who recently fled to the Taihang Liberated Area: The Yan bandit ordered that all men between the ages of eighteen and forty-eight must serve in the military. Those unwilling must pay a military service tax of 130 silver dollars and 3.6 shi of wheat (each silver dollar is equivalent to 100,170 Kuomintang currency). As a result, many businesses have closed down or reduced their storefronts. For example, the Yan bandit, under the pretext of expanding "cooperative" shares, levied huge sums of money from the citizens. Even children under the age of twelve had to pay, and residents without money had to mortgage their houses and land. Selling one jin of meat requires a tax of 4,000 yuan, one jin of flour requires a tax of 500 yuan, and the so-called "storefront donation" for Shuangxiang Restaurant is as high as 250,000 yuan per month. Prices: 170,000 yuan per shi dou of millet, 13,000 yuan per jin of white flour, 15,000 yuan per jin of salt, and 22,000 yuan per chi of foreign cloth. Tian is from Changyuan County, Hebei. He said that the market in Taiyuan is tense, and the citizens are eagerly awaiting early liberation.

　　我军解放石家庄后
    太原阎匪惊恐
  　大肆抓丁派款图延残喘
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫十九日电】石家庄为我解放后，太原阎匪极为惊恐，刻又大肆抓丁与向市民大量苛征，以图苟延残喘。近来人心惶惶，物价继续猛涨。市民则暗中设法逃来解放区。据最近逃来太行解放区之该市商人田培基称：阎匪勒令凡十八至四十八岁男子一律服兵役，不愿者须缴纳兵役税银洋一百三十元与小麦三石六斗（银洋每元折合蒋币十万零一千七百元）。商号因此停业与缩小门面者甚多。如阎匪借口所谓扩大“合作社”股金，向市民征发巨款，即十二岁以下幼童亦须摊缴，居民无款者以房地货物抵押。卖肉一斤须缴税四千元，面一斤须缴税五百元，双香饭馆的所谓“门面捐”，每月即达二十五万元。物价：小米每市斗十七万元，白面每斤一万三，盐每斤一万五，洋布每尺二万二。田为河北长垣县人，据称太原市面紧张，市民感盼早获解放。
