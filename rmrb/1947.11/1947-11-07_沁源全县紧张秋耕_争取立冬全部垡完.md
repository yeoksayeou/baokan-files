    Qin Yuan County Intensifies Autumn Plowing, Striving to Finish All Sod Turning Before the Beginning of Winter

    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch of the 4th] Qin Yuan's autumn plowing movement has become a roaring success after in-depth publicity, mobilization, organization, and leadership. Out of the county's 330,000 mu of autumn fields, 110,000 mu have already been turned. It is estimated that all can be completed before the Beginning of Winter. Since the Beginning of Autumn, the county has put forward the slogan of "cut one piece, plow one piece," but because the masses have the habit of cutting all first and then plowing, various delays and unwillingness to autumn plow have arisen. For example, "If the autumn wind blows, grind the autumn harvest, don't grind the land, it's okay to plow it next year," "We can still harvest grain without autumn plowing these past few years," "Can't clear the land, can't unfold the plow, it's not too late to plow after the harvest is almost done"; even among cadres, there is also the fear of having too much to do, "People only have two hands, how can they take care of it all." After discovering these problems, each district put forward different slogans according to different situations, carrying out in-depth and universal publicity and mobilization. The first district proposed "Autumn scratches the skin, better than plowing several times next year," the second district proposed "After the leap month, planting the fields will be as quick as a horse galloping," and other districts all proposed propaganda slogans such as "One year of crops, two years of hard work." Mobilization was carried out from the base points to the natural villages, repeatedly explaining the importance of autumn plowing and the danger of preventing drought in the coming spring. Then, the various difficulties of the masses were deeply discovered and resolved, as well as organization and leadership. Cadres in the first district first gathered mutual aid team leaders and old farmers in Wangjiayuan to discuss organizing autumn plowing, and after understanding the difficulties of plowing manpower and animal power, they put forward methods such as "respect for the elderly in production" and "pulling coal in winter slack, plowing land in autumn busy," arranging the time well, and specifically dividing the work. Semi-laborers harvested, full-laborers carried, and old men plowed the land. Mutual aid teams formed cattle-sharing groups to plow as they harvested. Therefore, in the entire district, from October 15th to 20th, in five days, 300 yokes of cattle plowed more than 3,500 mu of land. Other villages such as Pipa Garden in the second district, Yaobi in the fourth district, and Hanhong in the third district also carried out large-scale labor exchanges for autumn harvest and autumn plowing according to different labor, each selecting an autumn plowing leader to unify planning and unify action, proposing "Plow hemp fields first, then grain fields, corn stubble fields last," "Plow shady slopes first, then sunny slopes." Yaobi Village further clarified the division of labor, with the mutual aid team leader responsible for slow harvesting, and the autumn plowing team leader responsible for poor plowing. In addition, each district has made new creations in terms of equivalent exchange, appropriately solving this problem. Pipa Garden classifies cattle by grade and tops work accordingly, with bulls being grade A, each cattle work topping three person-days, and cows being grade B, each cattle work topping two and a half person-days, regardless of fodder, giving preferential treatment to poor hired laborers who plow land at a reduced price; Wangyun Village classifies cattle into three grades with the same work topping, one cattle work topping one person-day, first-class cattle earning 20 catties of grass and 5 sheng of feed, second-class cattle 15 catties of grass and 4 sheng of feed, and third-class cattle 13 catties of grass and 3 sheng of feed; Wangjiayuan and Wangtou Village calculate work by mu; Longquan Village calculates work by plow, with a step plow (wooden plow) topping two person-days per mu, and a pointed plow (iron plow) topping two and a half person-days for two person-days; Yaobi calculates work by shaft, with a double-shaft cattle topping two and a half person-days, and a double-shaft cattle topping three and a half person-days. Longquan Village also stipulated that 3 catties of spinning cotton could be exchanged for 5 plowing days. What is particularly worth pointing out in the autumn plowing is that joint village inspection groups were organized to carry out a mass inspection movement, greatly promoting the autumn plowing work. The first district is freely formed by three or five villages into mutual inspection groups for regular inspections. After Huo Deng's inspection, all 360 livestock at the base point were all on the land. Wangjiayuan gave the old men good meals when plowing, helped carry the plow, elected models, and commended them immediately, overcoming the phenomenon of underestimating the elderly and encouraging the old men's enthusiasm, plowing the land more, finer, and deeper.

    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch of the 5th] Qin County's Fourth District enthusiastically launched a campaign for leaders to establish merit in autumn plowing, plowing 10,030 mu of land in five days. Since the district-wide village cadre meeting on October 23rd called on leaders to establish merit in autumn plowing, village leaders have attached importance to this work. The eight villages that have completed harvesting, such as Rensheng, Wangbao, and Kaicun, have automatically turned to autumn plowing, and the villages that have not finished threshing have also allocated women and children to threshing, and men to plowing. Currently, from the 23rd to the 27th, 600 livestock in the entire district have plowed 10,030 mu of land in five days. The autumn plowing merit establishment movement is now developing vigorously.

    沁源全县紧张秋耕
    争取立冬全部垡完
    【本报太岳四日电】沁源秋垡运动经过深入宣传动员组织领导后轰轰烈烈。全县三十三万亩秋田已垡过十一万亩。确计在立冬前可全部垡完。该县在立秋以来即提出“割一块犁一块”的口号，但由于群众有先割完后犁地的习惯，产生了各种拖延与不愿秋垡的思想，例如“刮风磨秋不磨地，来年再垡也可以”，“这几年不秋垡也能打粮食”，“腾不了地展不开犁，收的差不多了再犁也不迟”；即在干部中亦有“人只有两只手，还能顾得来”的怕多事情绪。发现这些问题后，各区便根据不同的情况，提出不同的口号，进行深入的普遍的宣传动员，一区提出“秋天划破皮胜过来年犁几犁”，二区提出“过了闰月年走马就种田”，其他区都提出“一年庄稼两年闹”等宣传口号，从基点到自然村都做了动员，反复说明秋垡的重要性及来年春耕要防天旱的危险，继即深入发现与解决群众的多种困难，以及组织领导，一区干部先在王家园召集互助组长与老农民讨论组织秋垡，了解了犁地人畜力的困难，便提出“生产敬老”、“冬闲拉炭、秋忙垡地”等办法，安排好时间，又具体分工，半劳力收割，全劳力担，老汉犁地，以互助分队组成牛犋小组，随收随犁，所以全区从十月十五日到二十日五天内，三百犋牛就垡地三千五百余亩。其他二区之琵琶园，四区之姚壁，三区之韩洪等村，亦依据不同的劳动进行秋收秋垡大变工，各选出秋垡股长，统一计划统一行动、提出“先垡麻地后垡谷地，玉茭茬地在后面”，“先垡阴背后垡阳坡地”，姚壁村更明确分工，收的慢互助组长负责，犁不好秋垡组长负责。另外在等价交换方面各区都有新的创造，适当的解决了这一问题。琵琶园是按牛分等、按等顶工，公牛为甲等，每一牛工顶三个人工，母牛为乙等，每一牛工顶二个半人工，不管草料，给贫雇犁地按减价优待；王云村是牛分三等顶工一样，一牛工顶一人工，头等牛赚草二十斤、料五升，二等牛草十五斤、料四升，三等牛草十三斤料三升；王家园、王头村则是按亩计工；龙泉村是按犁计工，步犁（木头犁）一亩顶工两个，尖犁（铁犁）二亩半顶两个工；姚壁是按辕顶工，双辕牛顶两个半人工，双辕牛顶三个半人工。龙泉村并订出纺花三斤换犁地工五个。在秋垡中特别值得指出的，即是组织了联村检查团，展开群众性的检查运动，大大推动了秋垡工作。一区是由三村或五村自由结成互相检查团，定期检查，霍登经过检查后，全基点三百六十犋牲口全部上地，王家园在犁地时给老汉吃好饭，帮助扛犁，选举模范，即时表扬，克服了轻视老年人的现象，鼓舞了老汉劲头，犁地犁的又多又细又深。
    【本报太岳五日电】沁县四区热烈展开领导秋垡地立功，五天内垡地一万零三十亩，自十月二十三日全区村干部会上号召领导秋垡立功后，各村领导即重视这一工作。已收割完的仁胜、王堡、开村等八村自动转入秋垡，没有打完的村子亦分配妇女、儿童打场，男人犁地。现全区从二十三日到二十七日五天内六百犋牲口已垡地一万零三十亩，现秋垡立功运动正蓬勃开展。
