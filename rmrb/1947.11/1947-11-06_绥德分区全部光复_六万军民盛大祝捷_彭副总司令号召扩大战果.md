Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 4th: The Suide District has been completely recovered. More than 60,000 soldiers and civilians of Suide held a grand victory celebration on the evening of the 21st of last month in the eastern suburbs of Suide. Liu Yuhou and Wang Debiao, famous labor heroes of the district, and Zheng Deyin, a combat hero who participated in the Qingjian battle, were honored as chairmen of the presidium of the meeting. The rostrum was covered with bright lights, illuminating the vivid couplets hanging on both sides: "Launch a nationwide counter-offensive, fight to Nanjing to capture the bandit Chiang; the border region vows to recover, liberate the Northwest and destroy the Hu barbarians." The meeting began with eight cannon salutes and the playing of military music. Amid enthusiastic applause, Deputy Commander Peng first appeared on the stage and said: "Under the personal guidance of Chairman Mao, the Northwest People's Liberation Army has carried out seven months of self-defense war, annihilated more than 60,000 enemies, defeated Hu Zongnan and launched a counter-offensive, achieving the first step of victory. We have completely recovered the Suide police district and liberated Yanchang, Yanchuan, and Zichang. We will continue to recover Sanbian, Longdong, and Yan'an, eliminate the Hu bandits, liberate the Great Northwest, overthrow Chiang Kai-shek, and liberate all of China." He called on the combat troops to improve their tactics, learn the art of attacking fortified positions, conscientiously implement the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points of Attention, and continue to expand the achievements and expand the victory. Finally, he called on cadres at all levels to do a good job in land reform, mobilize all forces to support the front, and thoroughly eliminate counter-revolutionary elements. Zhang Bangying, Secretary of the Suide CPC District Committee, spoke, expressing his respect on behalf of the people of the police district to the fighting soldiers and civilians of the entire border region, and called on the soldiers and civilians of the entire district to work harder to support the front, join the army, participate in stretcher teams and transportation teams, vigorously carry out land reform, eliminate Chiang's feudal pawns, and rebuild the people's happy life. Then, combat hero Zheng Deyin spoke. Zheng is from Suide and only joined the army in July this year. In the Qingjian battle, he led a platoon to defeat the enemy's counter-attack and was the first to climb Bijia Mountain, earning the title of combat hero. He said loudly: "I joined the army to defend our Chairman Mao and protect the old folks of our entire border region. In the future, I will study harder and fight harder." Labor hero Liu Yuhou was also invited to speak. In May of this year, he led a stretcher team to follow the army on a long expedition, risking his life to rescue the wounded. After his term expired and he returned home, he immediately signed up to join the army. He is now waiting to be assigned to the army with a large number of new soldiers. He said passionately: "I have already joined the army. I am a farmer and don't know how to fight, but I must learn. We must fight to Yan'an and capture Hu Zongnan alive." The meeting did not end until late at night.
