　　Organizing Poor and Hired Peasants to Calculate Harvested Grain
  　Transporting and Weaving to Supplement the Year's Harvest
  　Jia Yu Sets Plan to Earn One Million This Winter
    [This report from Yushe] Jia Yu Village suffered a severe drought this year, and the harvest was greatly reduced. However, some farmers had complacent attitudes, underestimating the disaster. They developed wasteful ideas like "Whether we harvest or not, it's enough to eat for a season!" For example, Yue Changcai said: "Since we were liberated, we've never harvested less than six shi of grain. This year, we harvested seventeen shi, so shouldn't we give everyone a taste of cake?!" During the harvest, every family ate cake, wasting seven or eight shi of rice. They said: "Although the weather was very dry in the first half of the year, the harvest is not as good as last year, but it should be enough to get by." Some let the collected wild vegetables rot. After calculation, the whole village of sixty-four households harvested two hundred and thirty-seven shi of grain less, an average of two shi and seven sheng less per person. The village organized the calculation of typical poor and hired peasant households. Yue Changcai (who had been thoroughly liberated) calculated first: his family of five harvested seventeen shi of grain, and after deducting public grain and wages, only fifteen shi and four dou were left, barely enough to eat. There were no funds for clothing, livestock feed, reinvestment in production, and miscellaneous expenses. Poor peasant Ren Sanze, with a family of five, harvested only seven shi of grain, not even enough to eat for half a year. He said: "We are newly liberated households, without a foundation, and without any income. Everything depends on these two crops of grain, so we must plan carefully. We are still short!" Meng Shengsuo said: "We are newly liberated households, and according to this year's harvest, no family has enough to eat. We must work hard on winter production, collect vegetables, store grain, and economize to make up for the deficit!" Then, after discussion by the poor peasant association, the whole village was connected, and a winter production plan was formulated: the village had fifty-six male laborers and six donkeys, and forty-three women who could spin. Based on different production conditions and labor strength, they voluntarily combined to form five male groups and seven female groups for transportation, carrying, gathering firewood, hauling coal, selling cakes, tapping rosin, running oil mills, and weaving. They said: "We don't have the ability to do big things. Labor is our capital. Don't look at big profits; even small jobs can make money!" They also put forward the slogan: "Rely on the mountain to eat the mountain, rely on the water to eat the water, do whatever we can. Men earn two shi of rice, women earn ten jin of cotton, make up for the deficit year, support the great counter-offensive, and overthrow old Chiang." The specific plan was for the firewood gathering group of twenty-five people, each person to gather seventy jin per day, at a market price of eight yuan per jin, earning 600,000 yuan in one and a half months, and then gathering for their own use in the remaining time. The six donkeys and five people in the transportation group mainly rely on transporting coal from Jiangtang Town to the city gates to sell, going back and forth every two days, eating at home, without travel expenses, earning a total of 4,800 yuan each time, and 140,000 yuan in two months. Thirteen people organized to carry goods to and from Hongshui Zuquan, seeking profit without capital, bringing dry food, rice, and flour, and planning to travel twenty-one times each in the three winter months (each person estimated at 1,000 yuan), earning 260,000 yuan. Seven people organized to sell cakes in the city gates, going to the market every two days. Each person sells an average of one dou of rice cake per market, earning seven sheng of rice, and planning to go to thirty-five markets, earning seventeen shi of rice. The remaining six people who tap rosin and run oil mills plan to earn ten shi of rice in the three winter months. The seven women's spinning groups discussed spinning wool for the Fengmin Factory, with a wage of 330 yuan per jin. In addition to chores and cooking, each person must spin sixty jin of wool, earning 19,000 yuan, and forty-three people earn a salary of 817,000 yuan, which can buy more than 1,000 jin of cotton (at a market price of 800 yuan per jin). Zhao Yuxian and other groups proposed competitions: "Spin wool to earn capital, then spin cotton to earn profits, we must exceed the task!" The whole village can earn 1,000,000 yuan (each shi estimated at 13,000 yuan) from winter production, carrying, transportation, gathering firewood, etc., which can buy seventy shi of rice, and a total of ninety-six shi of rice including selling cakes and running oil mills, and the women can earn 1,000 jin of cotton. Finally, everyone said: "We will summarize every half month, and do whatever work is profitable. As long as we organize and take action, there will be a way." The bonus method is to evaluate work points by the hour or by the jin and distribute dividends. They started immediately from the twenty-fourth and fifth day of the lunar September and established a winter production leading committee to uniformly lead the winter production tasks in an organized and planned manner, to make up the deficit, and to overcome the natural disasters.

　　组织贫雇算收粮
  　运输纺织补年成
  　贾峪订计划争取今冬赚百万
    【本报榆社讯】贾峪村今年因受旱灾的严重袭击，收成大为减少，但有部分农民在思想上存在着麻痹轻视灾荒的自满情绪，产生了“收不收吃一秋”的浪费思想，如岳长才说：“咱翻了身，从未打过六石粮，今年打了十七石，还能不给大家吃顿糕？！”在打谷时家家吃糕，浪费了七、八石米，他们说：“前半年虽天气很旱，收成比不上去年，但也对付够吃。”有的把集下的野菜叫烂了，经过计算以后，全村六十四户少收粮二百三十七石，每人平均少收二石零七升，并组织计算贫雇典型户，岳长才（翻身较彻底）他首先计算，全家五口人，打了十七石粮，除去公粮工资等外，只剩十五石四斗，仅够人吃，其他穿戴、及牲口粮、再生产投资、杂支等就无款项。贫雇任三则，五口人打了七石来粮食，光吃也不足半年，他说：“咱们是新翻身户，没有根底，又无来项，做啥也是指的两棵粮食，要细打算，可短的还多哩！”孟生锁说：“咱们新翻身户，按今年收成计算，那家也不够吃，还得好好搞冬季生产集菜存粮节约来弥窟窿！”接着，经过贫雇会讨论，串通全村，订出了冬季生产计划：全村男劳力五十六个，毛驴六头，纺妇四十三人，分别根据不同的生产条件，及劳力强弱，自愿结合，共组成运输、担挑、拾柴、拉煤、卖糕、打腊、闹油坊、纺织等男五组女七组，他们说：“闹大没能耐，劳力是本钱，不要看大利，端石头买卖能赚钱！”并提出“靠山吃山，靠水吃水，能干啥干啥，男人赚下两石米，妇女要赚十斤花，弥补窟窿年，支援大反攻刨倒老蒋”的行动口号。具体计划出拾柴组二十五人，每人一天拾七十斤，每斤市价八元，拾一个半月赚洋六十万元，下余时间拾下自己烧。运输毛驴六头，人五个，主要靠到讲堂镇驮煤去城关卖，两天走一回，吃到家里，不用盘费，每回共赚洋四千八百元，两月能赚洋十四万元。十三个人组织担挑，到洪水左权往返运输，无本寻利，带上干粮米面，计划冬三月每人走二十一回。（每人以一千元计），能赚洋二十六万元。七人组织到城关卖糕，两天一集，每人每集平均卖一斗米糕，就能赚米七升，计划赶三十五个集，就能赚米十七石。其余打腊、闹作坊六人，冬季三个月要赚米十石。纺妇七组，讨论出给丰民工厂纺毛，每斤工资三百三十元，除杂活做饭外，每人要纺六十斤毛，赚洋一万九千元，四十三人赚工资洋八十一万七千元，能买花（每斤以市价八百元计）一千余斤。赵玉仙等组互提出竞赛：“纺毛赚下本，纺花再转利，一定要超过任务！”全村冬季生产担挑、运输、拾柴等共能赚洋一百万元（每石以市价一万三千元计），能买米七十石，连卖糕、市油坊，共赚米九十六石，纺妇能赚花一千斤。最后大家说：“咱们半个月总结一回，啥活有利干啥活，只要组织起来动弹，就有办法”。分红办法是以时以斤评工分红。说干就干，从阴历九月二十四、五日全部开始，并成立了冬季生产领导委员会，统一领导，有组织有计划的完成冬季生产任务，补起窟窿，战胜天灾。（肖先、润生）
