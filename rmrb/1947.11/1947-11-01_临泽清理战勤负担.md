(From our newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region on the 30th) Linze is actively clearing the numbers for war support and firewood/grain supplies in various districts and villages to enhance its support for the front lines. Because the county has been in a guerrilla environment for a long time, various burdens have not been cleared for a long time. The central areas still have collection procedures, but the marginal areas don't even have procedures. Many use red and white slips, and grain and firewood coupons are used as banknotes. Some villages provide stretchers, and each person receives 20 jin of wheat per day, or even 50 or 60 jin. No one knows for sure whether each village has exceeded or still has a surplus, resulting in unreasonable burdens and low morale among the masses. The sorting method is divided into three types: First, sort out the wheat harvest. After deducting those who have been reduced or exempted due to enemy destruction or special circumstances, the actual amount collected will be adjusted based on how much each village has already burdened. The second is to sort out war support. How many laborers, stretchers, vehicles, etc. have been provided by each village? If there are no procedures, those who can find the actual ones should state them clearly and supplement the procedures for fair allocation in the future. The third is to strictly separate last year's summer levy, last year's autumn levy, and this year's levy, so as to avoid increasing accumulations and making it impossible to settle accounts. The Second District has completed the clearing. Other districts are starting to work on it.

    临泽清理战勤负担
    【本报冀鲁豫三十日电】临泽为增强支援前线的力量，现在积极清理各区村战勤及柴粮供给数字。该县因长期处于游击环境下，以致长期未清理过各种负担。中心区还有征收手续，边缘区连手续都没有，很多使用红白条子的，粮柴票当钞票。个别村庄出担架，每人每天领二十斤麦子，甚至五、六十斤的都有。各村到底超过或尚存谁也不摸底，因而造成负担上的不合理，群众情绪低落。整理的办法分三种：第一是整理麦收，除去敌灭以及特殊情况减免者外，到底实收多少，各村已经负担多少，实行调剂。第二整理战勤。各村出过多少夫、担架、车辆等，没有手续者，能找出确实的明说，补上手续，将来公平的摊派。第三整理去年夏征去年秋征和今年的严格分开，省得越累越多，以致无法清算。二区已清算完毕。其他区正着手进行。
