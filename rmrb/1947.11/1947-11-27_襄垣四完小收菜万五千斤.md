　　Xiangyuan Fourth Complete Primary School
    Harvests 15,000 Catties of Vegetables
    [This Newspaper's Report] Xiangyuan Fourth Complete Primary School, with a total of more than 130 teachers and students, organized themselves to gather wild vegetables in the fields during the spring famine this year. The amount of vegetables collected each day was more than enough to eat. In addition to gathering wild vegetables, they actively planted vegetables. After the autumn harvest, the total yield of radishes, yams, etc., was more than 15,000 catties (including the production of the students' groups), which is estimated to be enough to eat until February or March of next year. Recently, they have organized themselves again to collect leftover vegetables in the fields (vegetables dropped by villagers and in gardens) in preparation for eating during the spring famine next year.

　　襄垣四完小
    收菜万五千斤
    【本报讯】襄垣四完小，全校教员和同学共一百三十多人，今年春荒时期，教员和同学们都组织起来到野外打菜，每天打的菜除吃了还有余。打野菜外又积极种菜，秋收后计算萝卜、山药等共收万五千多斤，（学生们的小组生产也在内）计算能吃到明年二、三月。近又组织起来上地收拾残菜（老乡们和园地掉了的菜）准备明年春荒吃。（启明、中华、凤岐、培云、学斌、生润）
