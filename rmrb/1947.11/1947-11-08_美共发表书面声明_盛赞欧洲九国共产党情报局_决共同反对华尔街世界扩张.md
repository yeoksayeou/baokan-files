Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: New York dispatch: According to reports from Agence France-Presse and the Associated Press, the Chairman of the Communist Party USA, Foster, and General Secretary Dennis, issued a written statement here on the 2nd, praising the establishment of the Communist Information Bureau of Nine European Countries, declaring that this move "is of great significance" and "will be welcomed by all anti-fascist, anti-imperialist elements and peace-loving people in various countries." The statement continued: The Communist Parties of these countries, in the face of the Marshall Plan—Wall Street's plan to enslave Europe and the world—should naturally once again prove that they are the best advocates of their countries' independence and the welfare of peace-loving people. It is clear that the joint declaration and the formation of the Information Bureau have strengthened their cause of defending national freedom and peace; and made their resistance to imperialist expansion, intervention, and war plans more effective. When referring to the actions of the CPUSA, the statement said: "We Communists will always participate in this struggle to stop and defeat Wall Street's great march towards world domination, fascism, and war. We will continue to promote the cooperation of all peace-loving nations, promote the solidarity of workers internationally, promote the unity of all anti-fascist and anti-imperialist elements, especially the friendship between the American and Soviet people, as the main thread of international cooperation, in order to achieve peace among nations." The statement announced that the CPUSA has decided not to participate in the Belgrade "Communist Information Bureau" given the current political situation in the United States.
