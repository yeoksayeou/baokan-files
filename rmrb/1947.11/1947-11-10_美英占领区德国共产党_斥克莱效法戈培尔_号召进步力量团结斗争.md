Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: Berlin -- The Communist Party of Germany in the U.S. and British occupation zones is firmly leading the struggle against the anti-communist and anti-democratic offensives of the occupation authorities. The leading body of the Communist Party of Germany in the U.S. zone issued a statement on the 3rd, denouncing the statement by Clay, the U.S. zone commander, on anti-communist propaganda, as "Goebbels' slogans." The statement exposed: "The new trend in the U.S. military government's policy toward the German press (which can be called the beginning of an anti-communist propaganda offensive) is to encourage all reactionary and anti-people elements to implement their policy of dividing Germany and shifting the burden of war onto the working people." The statement protested against Clay's anti-communist offensive, pointing out: "Anti-communist offensives are often the beginning of opposition to all other progressive organizations," and called on "all progressive friends not to be discouraged in the struggle to unite all democratic forces and ensure the future of the German nation."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: Berlin -- The Socialist Unity Party of Germany demonstrated in front of the Hanover Opera House on the 2nd to protest against the British military government's ban on the "For Justice and Peace" conference originally scheduled for the 1st. A Communist Party spokesman said: "Despite the decision of the British military government, the conference will still be held."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: Berlin -- The Socialist Unity Party of Germany announced on the 2nd a letter sent by the party to the Allied Control Council on September 30, demanding a solution to the German problem based on the implementation of German unification. The letter put forward the following specific recommendations: (1) Decide by popular vote whether the German people need a centralized government or a federal government; (2) Immediately establish German central administrative organs, abolish the borders of the occupation zones and the institutions of each occupation zone; (3) Thoroughly purge Nazi elements from administrative and economic institutions and confiscate their property; (4) Implement land reform; (5) Trade unions participate in production control; (6) Demand that all German prisoners of war be repatriated before the end of 1948. The letter was signed by Wilhelm Pieck and Otto Grotewohl, chairmen of the Socialist Unity Party.
