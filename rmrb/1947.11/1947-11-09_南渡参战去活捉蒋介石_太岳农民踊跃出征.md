Taiyue, November 6th (report from our newspaper) "Join the war! Capture Chiang Kai-shek alive!" This has been regarded by the masses in Taiyue as a supreme honor, and people are vying to rush to the front lines of the counter-offensive. Often, as soon as one group departs, the next group is already prepared. When twenty-four laborers from Kaicun Village in Qin County went on the expedition, the entire village mobilized to carry their more than 900 mu of crops entirely to the threshing ground, completing the harvest in three days. All the women worked day and night to make cotton clothes, shoes and socks for the departing men. They made sixteen pairs of shoes and thirty-eight cotton coats in four days. The same is true in the newly liberated area of ​​Linjin. When the second batch of laborers departed, the masses in various villages not only sent travel expenses, but also held banquets to see them off. After they gathered in the county, the government also staged operas to send them off. The laborers were warmly received almost everywhere they went. Stores offered discounts, and bathhouses offered reduced prices. When the laborers from Houjing Village in Yangcheng returned south after passing through Shengrenjian in Pinglu, the local masses held a welcome meeting and performed dramas such as "Looking Back" to express their gratitude. After the laborers left, their families received the same respect and preferential treatment as military martyrs' families. During the autumn harvest, wheat planting, and autumn plowing, each village prioritized military martyrs' families, participating war laborers, and rotation soldiers. Government agencies also provided assistance in harvesting and plowing in the same way. Upon their return, they received an even warmer welcome. When the second batch of laborers from Qinyuan returned from the south, the Yuebei Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Yuebei Administrative Office, and various agencies, along with local people, welcomed them from afar and organized a comfort group to visit each team. At the same time, they held a forum with twenty-three war heroes to listen to their reports on the expedition, especially when the first batch of laborers from Jiang County returned, a grand welcome meeting was held in Hongshui Town, and war heroes were commended, with over 10,000 men and women attending. Under such enthusiastic encouragement, everyone vied to join the war, and everyone vowed to capture Chiang Kai-shek alive. Yuan Maolin from Baima Village in the Fourth District of Yicheng wanted to join the war, but his family had already decided to marry him on the fifth day of the ninth lunar month and had made preparations. However, he said to them, "Marriage is not as urgent as participating in the war. Capturing Chiang Kai-shek alive is important. We can get married when I return." He went to pack his luggage and set off with the expedition team. It was not until the county found out and stopped him from going that Yuan Maolin became so anxious that he cried, insisting on going. After repeated persuasion and a promise that he would be given priority to go next time, he calmed down. When Liangshui Village in Changzi received the news that they were being assigned to send cotton clothes to the soldiers at the front, they prepared seventeen large carts overnight and fed the livestock well. At present, the number of war-participating laborers in various places cannot be counted. From Yuebei to the road on the south bank of the Yellow River, there is an endless stream of people coming and going every day.

    南渡参战去活捉蒋介石
    太岳农民踊跃出征
    【本报太岳六日电】“参战去！活捉蒋介石。”已被太岳群众认为无尚光荣的任务，到处争相奔赴反攻前线。常常这一批刚出发，下一批又已经准备妥当。沁县开村二十四个民工远征时，全村动员起来，把他们九百余亩庄稼完全担到场上，三天内全部打完，所有妇女更星夜为出征人赶制棉衣与鞋袜。四天赶出十六双鞋，三十八件棉衣。即新解放区临晋亦是如此，第二批民夫出发时，各村群众除送盘费外，又设宴欢送，集中到县里后，政府又唱戏欢送，几乎民工走到那里，就被那里热烈招待。商店减价，洗澡折扣。阳城侯井民工南征返回经平陆圣人涧时，当地群众即开欢迎会，并出演“回头看”等剧慰问。在民工出去后，家属受到与军烈属同样的尊敬与优待，在收秋种麦秋垡中，各村都是先尽军烈属与参战民工轮战民兵，各机关助收助耕亦同样如此，当参战回来时，更受到热烈的欢迎。沁源第二批南征民工返回时，中共岳北地委、岳北专署及各机关与当地群众远道欢迎，并组织慰劳团到各队慰问，同时召开二十三位参战功臣座谈会，倾听功臣们报告南征经过，尤其是绛县第一批民工返回时，在洪水镇召开了盛大的欢迎会，并给参战功臣贺功，男女到一万多人。在这种热情鼓舞之下，人人争相参战，个个立誓活捉蒋介石。翼城四区白马村袁茂林要参战，但他家里已决定在阴历九月初五给他娶媳妇，并已准备好，但他对人家说“结婚没有参战紧，活捉蒋介石重要，回来再结婚吧。”便自去收拾行李随远征队出发，直到县里知道了不让他去，袁茂林听了急得哭起来，非去不行，后经再三劝解，并保证下次一定叫他先去才安下心来。长子两水村得到派差给前方战士送棉衣消息时，连夜准备十七辆大车，把牲口喂的饱饱的。现各地参战民工已无法统计，从岳北到黄河南岸道上，每天来来去去络绎不绝。
