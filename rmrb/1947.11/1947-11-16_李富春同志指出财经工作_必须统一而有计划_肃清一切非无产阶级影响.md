Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 10th. Comrade Li Fuchun of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China made a summary report at the Third Financial and Economic Conference in the Northeast Liberated Area on September 3. He first pointed out that financial and economic work had achieved great results in the past, the most important of which was to help the working people achieve economic liberation, support the two-year self-defense war, and ensure the material supply of the massive field army. He then elaborated: After the summer offensive, the war situation in the Northeast has undergone fundamental changes. In the future, the scale of the war will continue to expand, and the situation will become increasingly favorable to us. The economic characteristics of the Northeast are no longer entirely an environment of guerrilla warfare built on an individual economy and divided. We have both vast rural areas and cities; both agriculture, handicraft industry and industry and mining, and railways connecting the entire region, a new democratic new economic environment with a national scale. Therefore, the most important and urgent task of financial and economic work in the Northeast Liberated Area today is to move from decentralization to unification, from disorder to organization, from blindness to planning and calculation, so as to rely on millions of people to organize all public and private economic forces, develop production, improve living standards, and support an unprecedented large-scale people's liberation war. However, some comrades have not yet understood this new situation, and are still using old experiences and old ideas to do things, and are influenced by some non-proletarian ideas, so that our work and thinking lag behind the needs of the development of the situation.

Comrade Fuchun criticized the following erroneous ideas: One is the simple guerrilla warfare viewpoint, regardless of the main force, thinking that they can be independent and do their own thing, not knowing that the current self-defense war is increasingly highly centralized, and developing towards a large scale, which also requires us to build the main force of the people's armed forces with the greatest strength and support the main force in combat. Relying solely on divided guerrilla warfare will never lead to victory. One is peaceful construction egalitarianism, doing this and doing that, deviating from the basics (land reform), deviating from the center (supporting the war), not understanding that all wartime facilities must proceed from the basic principle of being conducive to the victory of the war, and must be done with regard to priorities, otherwise the result will be scattered and wasted efforts, which will inevitably hinder the victorious development of the war. One is not considering supporting the front line and long-term plans, not knowing how to save the people's strength and financial resources, but pursuing formal extravagance and waste, so that the rear and the front are disconnected, and the work is disconnected from the war. Another is a narrow and conservative financial viewpoint, only caring about the immediate and local interests of the masses, not knowing that striving for the victory of the war is the long-term and fundamental interest of the people; therefore, relaxing the mobilization for war, and the burdens that the people must bear in the war; all our work must be able to combine the people's immediate practical interests with the people's long-term interests of liberation. Comrade Fuchun emphasized that it is worth noting that many financial and economic cadres have absorbed many bad puppet Manchukuo employees, brokers, and landlords to participate in the work, and have been paralyzed by the flattery and deception of these people. In addition, some cadres' own thinking is not sound, so in the thousands of financial and economic work, it is inevitable to hide dirt and accumulate filth, and there is ideological, policy, and action confusion and complexity. The feudal landlord class's independent administration, the grabbing of everything, and the separatist ideology, the bourgeoisie's free competition, the ideology of speculation and monopoly, and the small bourgeoisie's unrestrained, no-systematic, scattered spontaneity are all manifested to varying degrees; the specific concentrated expression of these non-proletarian ideas is localism; local highlights, local detachment from the whole. Therefore, a fundamental contradiction has arisen in the past two years, that is, the decentralized and chaotic state of financial and economic work, where ten fingers have not yet been clenched into a powerful fist, and the urgent need to unify preparations, divide labor and cooperate, and form an integrated support for the war. These chaotic and complex ideas and practices are detached from the masses, regardless of the overall situation, and are incompatible with the people's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal new democratic economic policies led by the proletariat, and are also incompatible with the economic situation and financial and economic tasks of the Northeast Liberated Area.

Following this, Comrade Fuchun called on party, government, military, and civilian organs at all levels to strengthen the leadership of financial and economic work, carry out criticism and self-criticism, clarify the above-mentioned various complex ideas, correct localist tendencies, and conscientiously implement the unified viewpoint, war viewpoint, mass viewpoint, and development viewpoint into the financial and economic front, so that financial and economic work can catch up with the needs of the development of the situation, and the great victory in military and political aspects. Finally, Comrade Fuchun explained that the Northeast Liberated Area is still a new force, and we have the favorable conditions that other liberated areas do not have. As long as we realize the economic policy of relying on the masses, taking into account both the military and the people, unified preparations, hierarchical responsibility, precise calculation, and forming an integrated whole, and strive to develop agriculture and industry, ensuring large public financial resources and striving for local production self-sufficiency. We can not only overcome the existing fundamental contradictions, but also overcome the contradictions between large public and small public, public and private, urban and rural areas, so that we can move towards victory.

　　李富春同志指出财经工作
    必须统一而有计划
  　肃清一切非无产阶级影响
    【新华社东北十日电】中共中央东北局李富春同志九月三日在东北解放区第三次财经会议上作总结报告，首先指出过去财经工作有很大的成绩，最主要的是帮助劳动人民在经济上翻了身，支援了两年的自卫战争，保证了庞大的野战军的物质供给。继即阐述：经过夏季攻势后，东北战争形势已起基本变化，今后战争规模将日益扩大，形势是日益有利于我们。东北经济的特点已不完全是一个建立在个体经济上被分割的游击战争的环境，我们既有广大农村又有城市；既有农业手工业又有工业矿业，而且有铁路联成整块地区的，带有国家规模的新民主主义的新经济环境。因此，今天东北解放区财经工作的最主要和最急切的任务，是由分散走向统一，由零乱走向有组织，由盲目走向有计划、有计算，从而依靠千百万人民组织一切公私经济力量，发展生产，改善生活，支援空前大规模的人民解放战争。但有些同志还没有了解这种新情况，仍然用老经验和旧观点在办事，并为一些非无产阶级的思想所影响，因此使我们的工作和思想落后于形势发展的需要。
    富春同志指责了下列几种错误的思想：一种是单纯游击战争观点，不管主力，认为可以独立自主的各搞一套，不知道现在的自卫战争是日益的高度集中，和向着大规模的方面发展，也就要求我们以最大的力量来建设人民武装的主力，支持主力作战，单靠分割的游击战争是绝不能致胜的。一种是和平建设平均主义，这样也作，那样也办，脱离基本（土地改革），脱离中心（支援战争），不了解战时的一切设施都必须从有利于战争胜利的基本原则出发，要分别轻重缓急来作，否则结果是分散与浪费力量，必将阻碍战争的胜利发展。一种是不从支援前线和长期打算，不知道节省民力财力，而追求形式铺张浪费，使后方与前方脱节，工作与战争脱节。另一种是狭窄的保守的财政观点，只顾群众眼前局部利益，不知道争取战争的胜利是人民的长远的基本利益；因而放松对战争的动员，与人民在战争中必须的负担；我们一切工作要能很好的把人民的眼前实际利益与人民解放的长久利益结合起来。富春同志着重指出：值得严重注意的是许多财经干部，吸收了许多不好的伪满职员、经纪人、地主参加工作，被这班人的吹拉骗所麻痹。加以有些干部本身的思想就不健全，因此在千头万绪的财经工作中，都不免藏垢纳污，发生着思想上、政策上、行动上的混乱庞杂。封建地主阶级各自为政、各抓一把的割据思想，资产阶级自由竞争，投机垄断的思想，以及小资产阶级不受约束、不要制度的散漫自发性，均或多或少的表现出来；这些非无产阶级思想的具体集中表现，就是本位主义；局部突出，局部脱离全部。因而两年来产生了一个基本矛盾，即分散零乱、十个手指尚未握成有力拳头的财经工作状态，与必须统一筹备、分工合作，结成一体支援战争的迫切需要之间的矛盾。这些混乱庞杂的思想和作法，是脱离群众，不顾大体的，都是同无产阶级领导的人民反帝反封建的新民主主义的经济政策不相容的，也是同东北解放区的经济情况与财经任务不相容的。
    继之，富春同志号召各级党政军民机关加强财经工作的领导，开展批评与自我批评，澄清上述各种庞杂的思想，纠正本位主义倾向，把统一观点、战争观点、群众观点与发展观点认真贯彻到财经战线上去，使财经工作赶上形势发展的需要，与军事、政治方面的伟大胜利。最后富春同志说明：东北解放区还是一个新生的力量，我们具备了其他解放区所没有的有利条件，只要我们实现依靠群众、军民兼顾、统一筹备、分层负责、精密计算、结成整体的经济方针，争取以农业为主发展农业、发展工业，确保大公财源、争取地方生产自给的财经计划。我们不但能克服现存的基本矛盾，且能克服大公与小公、公家与私人、城市与乡村的矛盾，使我们走向胜利。
