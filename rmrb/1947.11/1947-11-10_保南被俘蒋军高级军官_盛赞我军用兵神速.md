Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji Front, 7th. Generals Nie Rongzhen, Xiao Ke, and Luo Ruiqing granted an audience to KMT bandit Third Army Commander Luo Lirong and his Seventh Division Commander Li Yongzhang at the front headquarters. After returning from the front, the three generals granted an audience to Third Army Deputy Commander Yang Guangyu and Third Army Deputy Chief of Staff Wu Tiezheng on the 29th of last month. Yang was a student of the first class of Whampoa Military Academy, and Wu was a student of the third class. When Wu saw General Nie Rongzhen, his former commander, kindly ask him to sit down, he said with great shame: "It's been twenty years since I've seen the commander!" General Luo told Yang Guangyu that General Zuo Quan, the former Deputy Chief of Staff of the Eighth Route Army who was in the same class as Yang at Whampoa, had heroically sacrificed himself in the War of Resistance Against Japan, and pointed out: "Chiang Kai-shek made his fortune by relying on Whampoa, but he completely destroyed the revolutionary tradition of Whampoa. Only the Whampoa students in the People's Liberation Army today have maintained and developed this revolutionary tradition." Wu sighed and said: "The current army (referring to the KMT army) is just like Sun Chuanfang's army back then!" Yang and Wu both recounted their own experiences. Yang said: "Although I am a deputy army commander, it is just to be given a bowl of rice to eat. Nominally a lieutenant general, but in the organizational structure, I'm only a major general. Only those who are principal officers can get ahead, while deputy positions have the title but no real power." Wu was particularly dissatisfied with the fact that he was still a colonel and had been imprisoned by Hu Zongnan for three years. Yang said dejectedly: "The war cannot be fought any longer." General Nie pointed out to him: "We have always advocated peace, but Chiang Kai-shek tore up the Double Tenth Agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, forcing the people to accept war. KMT army officers should realize that it is meaningless to sacrifice for Chiang Kai-shek and the Four Big Families." Yang said: "Chiang Kai-shek blocks news, preventing us from knowing the truth of everything. What I have seen with my own eyes in the liberated areas these past few days is completely different from what I understood in the past. If the outside world (referring to the KMT-controlled areas) could know these truths, I believe the hearts of the people across the country would definitely turn to the CCP." They were extremely surprised by the speed of the People's Liberation Army's deployment this time. Wu said: We always thought that your main force was north of Baoding. By the time the planes notified us that your troops had been discovered, we hadn't even had time to prepare before we were surrounded. General Xiao Ke then laughingly asked Wu, "Did you see the Central News Agency say that you had completed your mopping-up mission and returned to Shizhuang?" Wu laughed and said, "I saw it! I saw it. Except for Chief of Staff Pang Zhongqian, who didn't come out due to illness, and the director of the news office, who hadn't taken office yet, everyone who came out of Shijiazhuang has either laid down their weapons or made pointless sacrifices." Finally, General Nie Rongzhen told them to rest well and study peacefully, "Our policy towards KMT officers and soldiers has been clearly stated in the Double Tenth Declaration." Yang and Wu immediately took their leave.

    保南被俘蒋军高级军官
    盛赞我军用兵神速
    【新华社晋察冀七日电】聂荣臻、萧克及罗瑞卿三将军曾于前线指挥部赐见蒋匪第三军军长罗历戎及其第七师师长李用章。三将军于前线归来后，于上月二十九日赐见第三军副军长杨光钰及第三军副参谋长吴铁铮。杨系黄埔一期学生，吴系黄埔三期学生，当吴看到当年的师长聂荣臻将军温和地让他坐下时，极为羞愧地说：“二十年没见司令了！”罗将军告诉杨光钰：与杨在黄埔同队的前八路军副参谋长左权将军，已在抗日战争中英勇牺牲，并指出：“蒋介石依靠黄埔发家，但他完全破坏了黄埔的革命传统，只有今天在人民解放军中的黄埔同学，才保持和发展了这个革命传统。”吴长叹说：“现在这个军队（指蒋军）就和那时孙传芳的军队一模一样！”杨、吴都诉说自己的遭遇，杨说：“我虽当了副军长，这不过是给一碗饭吃，名义上是中将，编制上却是少将，只有那些当主官的吃得开，副职是有职无权的。”吴对自己现在还是个上校，并被胡宗南关了三年监牢尤为不满。杨又颓丧地说：“战争是不能再打下去了。”聂将军当向他指出：“我们是一贯主张和平的，但是蒋介石撕毁了双十协定及政协决议，强迫人民接受战争，蒋军的官员应该觉悟到为蒋介石及四大家庭作牺牲是毫无意义的。”杨说：“蒋介石封锁消息，不让我们知道一切事情的真相，这几天在解放区亲眼所见，与过去了解完全两样，如果外面（指蒋管区）都能知道这些真相，我相信全国人心一定归向中共。”他们对此次解放军用兵神速，极为惊异，吴说：我们总以为你们主力在保定以北，待飞机通知我们已发现你们部队时，我们还未来得及准备，就被包围了。萧克将军当笑问吴道：“中央社说你们已完成扫荡任务，返回石庄，你看到这消息了吗？”吴大笑说：“看到了！看到了。除了参谋长庞仲乾因病未出来，新闻室主任未到任外，所有从石家庄出来的人，都已放下武器或作无谓牺牲了。”最后聂荣臻将军告诉他们要好好休息，安心学习，“我们对蒋军官兵的政策，已在双十节宣言中说得明明白白。”杨吴当即辞退。
