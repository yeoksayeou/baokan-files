Xinhua News Agency, East China, 2nd. The East China People's Liberation Army units have launched a speak bitterness and avenge grievances movement. Some units participated in mass counter-traitor speak bitterness public trial rallies, some organized local speak bitterness meetings for families of victims (massacred by the Chiang bandits), and some staged plays such as "The White Haired Girl" and "Blood and Tears of Hatred" to enlighten and educate the soldiers. The soldiers gnashed their teeth and shed tears, immediately pouring out their own grievances. At this time, the leadership proposed: "Speak bitterness if you have bitterness, avenge grievances if you have grievances," and launched typical speak bitterness, squad speak bitterness, and platoon speak bitterness. Some speak bitterness meetings lasted for three days without being completed. During the speak bitterness, many liberated soldiers handed over their Kuomintang party cards and armbands, frankly confessing the truth about being deceived and oppressed. After speaking bitterness, they then discussed bitterness and traced the roots, gradually realizing that they could not avenge their grievances unless they defeated Chiang Kai-shek. A soldier named Pan Jinan from a certain unit cried and said, "The names of those who killed my mother are all recorded in the revenge book. I will die without regrets, because my comrades will avenge me!" Yang Defang, a newly liberated soldier from Sichuan in a certain regiment, knelt down in public and swore, "If I don't fight my way back to Sichuan to take revenge, I am not a human being. If I don't overthrow old Chiang, I, Yang, am not born of a mother!" At this time, everyone proposed "Revenge requires unity," so the soldiers of the company spontaneously collected money to kill chickens and drink "unity wine," and vowed: "Grievances are remembered in our hearts, the enemies have been identified. Today we meet from thousands of miles away, with ten thousand hearts united. Knives against knives, guns against guns, we will not return until we avenge our grievances!" After the speak bitterness movement, a call was made to unite and make contributions. Some units also established "Revenge Books" and "Merit Books." The morale of officers, soldiers, and civilians to unite and kill the enemy has greatly increased.
    Xinhua News Agency, East China, 2nd. The East China General Logistics Department solemnly held a demobilization commendation and celebration meeting for civilian laborers on the 7th in a certain place. Of the more than three thousand civilian laborers, 1,244 were rated as "Support-the-Frontline Heroes." In the Lin-Xiong blockade battle, the Rizhao stretcher team transported day and night in torrential rain and muddy roads, with thorough air defense arrangements, proceeding as usual under enemy aircraft without suffering losses, and won the honorary title of "Aircraft Model Stretcher Team." The First and Second Detachments of the Jiaodong Donghai and Xihai Sub-districts won the "Li Yu Transportation Team." Sun Yuansheng, a civilian laborer from the Second Detachment of the Donghai Sub-district who made a special contribution, braved artillery fire and waded through mud in the Lin-Xiong blockade battle, going to the front line seven times in one night to transport ammunition, rescued three wounded soldiers, and captured four "Homecoming Corps" members with the help of medical personnel. While crossing the Yellow River, he rescued more than 30 wounded soldiers under enemy air raids. While crossing the Shahe River, he selflessly rescued three comrades in the rapids. When stationed, Sun helped his landlord cut sorghum, fetch water, push manure, feed cattle, and clean the yard, and was welcomed by the masses everywhere.

    掀起诉苦复仇运动
    部队杀敌情绪益高
    【新华社华东二日电】华东解放军各部掀起诉苦复仇运动，有的部队参加群众反奸诉苦公审大会，有的组织当地被难（被蒋匪屠杀）家属诉苦会，有的则上演“白毛女”、“血泪仇”等剧，对战士进行启发教育。战士们都咬牙切齿，涕泪纵横，当时即纷纷倾倒起自己的苦水来。这时领导上即提出：“有苦诉苦，有仇报仇”，展开典型诉苦，班诉苦和排诉苦，有的诉苦大会连开三天还不能完结。诉苦中不少解放战士交出国民党党证，臂章，坦白伸诉被欺骗、压迫真相。诉苦后就接着论苦追根，一步步认识到不打垮蒋介石就不能报仇雪耻。某部战士潘金安哭着说：“杀我亲娘的仇人都记在报仇簿上了，我拼死了也放心，同志们会替我报仇的！”某团四川借新解放战士杨得方当众跪下宣誓说：“我打不回四川报仇就不是人，不打倒老蒋我杨某就不是娘养的！”这时大家都提出“报仇要齐心”，于是该连战士自动集钱杀鸡喝“齐心酒”，并立誓说：“怨恨记在心，仇人已认清，今天我们千里相会，万人同心，刀对刀，枪对上，不报世仇不生还！”诉苦运动后即号召团结立功，若干部队并设制了“报仇簿”和“功劳簿”。官兵军民团结杀敌情绪倍加高涨。
    【新华社华东二日电】华东总兵站部七日于某地隆重举行民工复员评功庆功大会。计三千余民工中有一千二百四十四名被评为“支前功臣”。在临胸阻击战中，日照担架队在大雨滂沱道路泥泞中，昼夜转运，防空布置周密，在敌机下照常行进，未受损失，荣获“飞机模范担架队”的光荣称号。胶东东海、西海分区一、二大队荣获“黎玉运输队”。立特等功的东海分区二大队民工孙原圣在临胸阻击战中，冒炮火踏泥泞，一夜上前线运送七次弹药，抢救三个伤员，并与卫生员等活捉“还乡团”员四名。过黄河时，在敌机轰炸下抢运伤员三十余人，过沙河时，奋不顾身在激流中捞救了三个同志。驻防时孙即帮助房东割高梁、打水、推粪、喂牛、打扫院子，到处受群众欢迎。
