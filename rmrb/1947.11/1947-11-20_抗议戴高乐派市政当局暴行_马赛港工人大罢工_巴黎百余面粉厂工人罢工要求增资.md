　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: Marseilles dispatch: A major strike broke out in Marseilles, the largest port in southern France, starting on the 12th, to protest the provocations of thugs from the "French People's Rally." On the 10th, Marseilles citizens and workers organized a demonstration against the increase in tram fares. When the peaceful demonstrators advanced towards the city hall, the newly elected mayor, a member of the "French People's Rally," Calini, instigated the thugs under his command to fire on the crowd from bars near the city hall, resulting in forty to fifty people injured and one dead. The enraged crowd then rushed into the city hall and beat up the reactionary mayor. The General Confederation of Labour immediately protested, and more than 15,000 Marseilles dockworkers, sailors, and metalworkers went on strike at the call of the General Confederation of Labour, bringing Marseilles' industrial production to a standstill. The strike further expanded on the 13th, with food stores closing and transport trucks stopping. It is reported that workers in the Bouches-du-Rhône department to which Marseilles belongs will also hold protest strikes to support the struggle of the Marseilles workers.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: Marseilles dispatch: As of the 14th, the agitated Marseilles workers continued their strike. Although the French People's Rally used thugs to sabotage the strike and continued to provoke (such as firing on the Marseilles Communist Party headquarters on the 14th), the strike continued valiantly. No ships entered or left the port of Marseilles. The suburb of Saint-Loup was completely controlled by the strikers. Except for grain transport vehicles, which were allowed to pass, all other freight vehicles and trams were stopped. The reactionary authorities attempted to send defense forces to the area to suppress the strike, but this attempt failed because the defense force members sympathized with the strikers. On the 14th, the General Confederation of Labour ordered all workers to stop work and demonstrate during the funeral of the victim killed by thugs of the French People's Rally on the 12th. The Ramadier authorities attempted to prevent the development of the incident by punishing civil servants who were "not actively working" and shifting the blame for the Marseilles unrest to the Communist Party, but to no avail.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: Paris dispatch: Workers in 137 flour mills here began a strike on the 13th, demanding a 20 percent wage increase. Bakers claimed that Paris only had twelve days of flour supply, while the striking flour mill workers declared that if their demands were not met, they would cut off all flour supply to Paris.

　　抗议戴高乐派市政当局暴行
  　马赛港工人大罢工
    巴黎百余面粉厂工人罢工要求增资
    【新华社陕北十五日电】马赛讯：法国南部最大港口马赛，十二日起发生大罢工，抗议“法国人民联盟”流氓之挑衅。十日，马赛市民与工人曾组织示威反对电车费加价，当和平的示威者向市政府前进时，新当选的市长“法国人民联盟”盟员卡利尼，即唆使其手下的流氓自市政厅近傍之酒吧间向群众开枪，结果四五十人受伤，一人毙命。愤激的群众于是冲入市府，痛殴该反动市长。总工会并立即提出抗议，马赛码头工人、海员、五金工人一万五千余人，在总工会号召下即行罢工，使马赛工业生产顿呈瘫痪之状。十三日罢工更形扩大，食品商店关门，运输卡车停开。据悉，马赛所属之全罗尼省工人亦将举行抗议罢工，支持马赛工人的斗争。
    【新华社陕北十六日电】马赛讯：迄十四日止，激昂的马赛工人仍继续罢工中。法国人民联盟虽使用流氓破坏罢工及继续挑拨行为（如十四日向马赛共产党总部开枪），但罢工仍英勇坚持中。马赛港口没有船只进出。市郊赛得洛因区完全由罢工者所控制。除运粮汽车可允通行外，其他一切运货汽车及电车均告停驶。反动当局企图以防卫队赴该地进行镇压，然此企图已告失败，因防卫队员同情罢工者。十四日总工会下令在为十二日被法国人民联盟流氓枪杀的死难者出葬时，全体工人停止工作并举行示威。拉马第当局企图以惩办“不积极工作”的公务员，及将马赛骚动之责转嫁共产党的卑劣手段，阻止事件的发展，但无济于事。
    【新华社陕北十五日电】巴黎讯：此间一百三十七个面粉厂的工人，于十三日开始罢工，要求增加工资百分之二十。面包工人称：巴黎只有十二天的面粉供应，而罢工的面粉工人则声言，如果要求不予满足，则将断绝巴黎的一切面粉供应。
