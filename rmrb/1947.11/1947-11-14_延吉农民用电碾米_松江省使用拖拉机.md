　　◇The power transmission equipment in Mudanjiang Province has increased more than threefold compared to a year ago. The power transmission area has increased by six places, and the power transmission lines have been extended to 460,000 meters. The suburbs within about ten miles of the center of Harbin have all been electrified.
　　◇After the people of the Zhixin District of Yanji were liberated, their economic lives improved. The cooperative raised funds to build a small power station, which not only provides electricity for farmers' lighting but also supplies the district's light industries such as oil pressing and rice milling.
　　◇Coal production in the Jixi mining area of Mudanjiang Province has doubled compared to half a year ago, reaching 4,000 tons per day. Efforts are now being made to complete 400,000 tons of coal by the end of the year. After reorganization and a production competition, the Mashan Coal Mine is now producing 1,029 tons of coal per day, an increase of a quarter compared to the past.
　　◇Thanks to the efforts of the workers, the Andong Paper Mill can now repair machines in five days, which used to take fifty days during the puppet Manchukuo era. Production has now resumed.
　　◇The Jilin Provincial Forestry Bureau has established five forestry stations and two machine sawmills, producing more than 240 cubic meters of timber per day. In addition to the approximately 160 li of forest railway that has been completed near Tieling, the rest is also under construction.
　　◇Liberated farmers in Muling and Wulin, Mudanjiang Province, have organized agricultural slack-season gold mining teams. In the past two months, each person has had a surplus of more than 800,000 yuan after deducting living expenses. The gold mining farmers have established a trade union, and the 22 gold mining teams in the Wulin gold mining area have built a new workers' village with 78 houses.
　　◇The production efficiency of the Wuzhumu Salt Lake in Xilingol League, Inner Mongolia, is increasing daily, now producing 100,000 jin of salt per day.
　　◇The Songjiang Provincial Government has established the province's first mechanized farm in Shangzhi (formerly Zhuhe), which is cultivated using tractors. The farm has a total of seventeen tractors, land reclamation machines, and soil crushing machines. Five fire plows are now deployed daily to reclaim land, striving to reclaim 3,000 mu before the ground freezes. It is also planned to sow 10,000 hectares next year.
