　　Strengthen Organizational Leadership to Solve the Difficulties of Poor Peasants and Hired Laborers
  　Taihang Administrative Office Construction Department's Opinions on Winter Production
    I. This year, the farmers in our region who have obtained land have not had time to build their homes and gain a firm foothold, and they have encountered a fairly widespread crop failure, and the broad masses are still threatened by the spring famine next year. For the past six months, the key to our preparing for famine has been to seize the expansion of agricultural production and increase grain income, and we have achieved results; in the next few months of this winter and next spring, our goal is to universally launch sideline production, make up for the losses, and finally overcome the disaster, and make full preparations for next year's large-scale production.
    II. In most areas, although the crop failure is common to all classes, the poor peasants and hired laborers are the most short of food. Therefore, how to seize the gap in agricultural affairs in winter and spring, find a way out of life, and overcome difficulties has become the urgent demand of the poor peasants and hired laborers. This requires local leading organs and all cadres to first go deep into the poor peasants and hired laborers in organizing winter production, help them calculate their livelihood deficits, promote each person and each household to formulate production plans, and be responsible for solving various difficulties in production, and organize the enthusiasm of the poor peasants and hired laborers to tide over the famine and make up for the losses into action, making them the leading backbone for mobilizing all farmers to carry out sideline production movement. This is the basic key to determining whether winter production can become a truly mass movement and achieve the purpose of overcoming the famine.
    III. Due to the development of the war situation, the profits of general sideline transportation are very small, but this does not mean that the current sideline activities have no way out, but it means that this is the objective difficulty that we should recognize in organizing production, and requires that our guiding principles and practices for production must adapt to the current economic situation.
    Based on the above situation, our principles for developing sideline production should be: (1) Correctly analyze and understand the local economic situation, organize various production activities purposefully and plannedly, and always pay attention to changes in the surrounding market conditions, and strive to achieve production that can be produced and sold, and transportation that can be transported and sold, and overcome blindness in production guidance. (2) Promote the masses to widely seek various production outlets, everyone investigates, everyone thinks of ways, do whatever is beneficial, and do whatever is beneficial at any time. The responsibility of the leadership is to concentrate methods from the actual activities of the masses, summarize experience, combine with the overall situation, and guide the direction in a timely manner; and create all conditions conducive to the production of the masses (such as solving difficulties in funds and tools, building roads, and solving transportation and accommodation problems). We should overcome the subjective plan from top to bottom and the practice of restricting the hands and feet of the masses. (3) According to the current economic situation and the spirit of overcoming the famine, the profit of sideline business should not be required too high, accumulate small amounts into large amounts, and make long-term plans, "if you can eat while running, don't sit and eat", this is the correct thinking of the masses to overcome the famine and make up for the losses, and overcome the wrong idea of only looking at big profits and not looking at small profits, the result will be "small money can't be seen, big money can't be earned", our purpose is to earn food from production, save grain, and prevent spring famine next year. (4) Next year's spring is shallow, and life during the spring plowing period will inevitably be busy, and the large-scale re-examination of land reform will be carried out, and we will be ready to participate in the war and support the front at any time. In terms of mass labor and leadership strength, we must be tight, therefore, we must seize the gap in winter and spring, combine with sideline activities, and make sufficient preparations for next year's agricultural production; and accumulating fertilizer and storing firewood (or storing coal) is a basic part of the preparation work, and all regions should arrange and plan this work on the basis of mutual assistance, organize auxiliary labor, carry out fertilizer accumulation and firewood chopping, and can exchange prices with mutual assistance and other sideline production to ensure that sideline production and agricultural preparation are not delayed.
    (5) Since there are many difficulties in the objective economic conditions of winter production, and the broad masses must rely on winter income to overcome the disaster, therefore, all economic departments are required to make the greatest subjective efforts to overcome various obstacles and fully support mass production, and each department can formulate work plans according to its own situation. Industrial, commercial and trade organs should first face the outside areas, open up outlets for mountain goods and industrial and sideline products, and try to organize sales markets for professional products (coal, iron, magnetic, etc.) in friendly neighboring areas for this region, and pay attention to investigating the needs of the outside areas, guide various professional departments to transform finished products, and improve quality, so as to facilitate smooth sales. The second is to grasp the price changes in various places, organize material adjustment, and open up outlets for transportation labor.
    The bank should quickly concentrate appropriate funds through loan inspection to solve the capital difficulties of poor peasants and hired laborers in production, and focus on lending to areas with more serious disasters. In practice, we should rely on mutual assistance in production with poor peasants and hired laborers as the backbone, and use loans in an organized and centralized manner to give greater play to the role of funds. The cooperative should be the organizational core of winter production, adhere to the spirit of the Taihang August Cooperative Conference, resolutely transform the cooperative's business line, quickly shrink or stop direct business, withdraw funds, and fully organize sideline production mainly by poor peasants and hired laborers. According to local production conditions and the intentions of the masses, either credit loans or labor-capital dividends can truly combine capital and labor, and capital serves labor. However, in order to ensure the true implementation of this new cooperative management line, it is necessary to inspect and transform the new leading components of each village unit. Only by implementing the organizational line of the poor peasants and hired laborers in power can the cooperative be truly able to serve the turned-over masses wholeheartedly in overcoming the famine and production.

### 加强组织领导解决贫雇困难　太行行署建设处对冬季生产意见

　　加强组织领导解决贫雇困难
  　太行行署建设处对冬季生产意见
    一、本区今年获得土地的农民，还没有来及建好家务，站稳脚步，就碰上一次相当普遍的歉收，广大群众仍受来年春荒的威胁。大半年来，我们备荒的关键是抓紧了扩大农业生产，增加粮食收入，并已取得成绩；而在今冬明春的几个月中，我们的奋斗目标便是普遍发动副业生产，弥补亏空，最后渡过灾荒，并为明年的大生产进行充份准备。
    二、大部地区，歉收虽是遍及各阶层，但缺粮最多的却是贫雇层。因此，如何抓紧冬春农事空隙，找寻生活出路，渡过难关，便首先成为贫雇农民的急切要求。这就需要各地领导机关及所有干部，在组织冬季生产中首先要深入贫雇，帮助他们计算生活亏空，推动每人每户订出生产计划，并负责解决生产中的各种困难，把贫雇生产渡荒补窟窿的积极性组织到行动中去，使之成为发动全体农民开展副业生产运动的领导骨干。这是决定冬季生产能否成为真正群众性运动与达到渡荒目的基本关键。
    三、由于战争形势的发展，一般副业运输利润甚小，但这不是说当前的副业活动已毫无出路，而是说这是我们在组织生产中应该认识到的客观困难，要求我们指导生产的方针与做法须适应现实的经济情势。
    基于上述情况，我们开展副业生产的原则应该是：（一）正确的分析认识当地经济状况，有目的有计划的组织各种生产活动，并经常注意周围市场情况的变化，要求做到能产能售，能运能销，克服生产指导上的盲目性。（二）推动群众广泛的寻求各种生产出路，大家调查，大家想法，什么有利干什么，啥时有利啥时干。领导的责任是从群众实际活动中集中办法，总结经验，结合全面情况，及时指导方向；并创造有利于群众生产的一切条件（如解决资金、工具困难，修建道路，解决运输食宿问题等）应克服自上而下的主观计划一套，限制群众手脚的做法。（三）根据当前的经济情况与渡荒的精神，对副业的利润不应要求过高，集少成多，长远打算，“要能跑着吃，就不坐着吃”，这是群众渡荒补窟窿的正确思想，克服只看大利，不看小利的错误思想，其结果将是“小钱看不上，大钱赚不上”，我们的目的是从生产中赚出吃的，省下粮食，预防明年发生春荒。（四）明年春浅，春耕时期的生活必然忙迫，加以进行土改大复查，随时准备参战支前，在群众劳力及领导力量上都要吃紧，因此，我们要抓紧冬春空隙，结合副业活动，要为明年的农业生产作足够的准备；而积肥存柴（或存煤炭），则为准备工作中的基本一环，各地应在互助基础上安排计划这项工作，组织辅助劳力，进行积肥打柴，并可通过互助与其它副业生产等价交换，做到副业生产与农事准备两不误。
    （五）今冬生产的客观经济条件既然存在着许多困难，而广大群众又必须依靠冬季收入，渡过灾荒，因此，要求各个经济部门，要尽最大的主观努力，克服各种障碍全力支援群众生产，各部门可根据本身情况，订出工作计划。工商贸易机关，首先应面向外区，打开山货及工副业产品的出路，设法在友邻区为本区专业产品（煤、铁、磁等）组织推销市场，并注意调查外区的需要情况，指导各专业部门改造成品，提高质量，以有利于畅通销路。其次是掌握各地物价变化，组织物资调剂，为运输劳力开辟出路。
    银行应通过检查贷款，迅速集中适当资金，解决贫雇生产资本的困难，并以受灾较重地区为贷款重点。在做法上应依靠以贫雇为骨干生产的互助，有组织的集中使用贷款，以发挥资金更大的作用。合作社应是冬季生产中的组织核心，本着太行八月合作会议精神，坚决转变合作社的经营路线，从速紧缩或停止直接经营，抽出资金，全力组织以贫雇为主的副业生产，根据当地生产条件与群众意图，或是信用贷款，或是劳资分红，真正使资本与劳力相结合，资本服务于劳力。但为了保证这一条新的合作经营路线的真正贯澈实现，必须检查与改造各村单位新的领导成份，只有贯澈贫雇当权的组织路线，才能促使合作社真正能全心全意的为翻身群众的渡荒生产而服务。
