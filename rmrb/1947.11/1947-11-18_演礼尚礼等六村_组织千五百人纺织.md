After mobilization, Sun Shuzhen, a woman, automatically admitted to weaving two bolts of cloth. Then other women also admitted to one bolt, and voluntarily combined into 24 groups, launching a competition between groups, guaranteeing "dense weaving", "early delivery" and "good color". Shen Lianmei and other three people in Dongguan Village, the third district, stopped all their work and wove military cloth first, and have now completed 30 bolts. The Fifth District launched a district-wide challenge at the joint meeting of women's association directors in various villages, guaranteeing "voluntary combination and following the mass line." Sun Xiulan, Su Dazhang and other six weaving team leaders in Dawumao Village, the third district of Gucheng, spend money every night to buy oil and lead each person to spin one and a half liang of thread. Chai Wangshi, the weaving committee member of Chaizhuang in the third district, checks each household three times a day to complete the task. Some village women in Zhentang County are so busy that they can't even eat enough. Some weave cloth until 12 o'clock at night, and some until the rooster crows. The 41 sisters of Chenzhuang Sisters Group in the ninth district of Wuxun guarantee to spin two liang of thread per person per day without delaying their studies.
