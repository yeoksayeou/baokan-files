    Strengthen Economic Struggle Against the Enemy
    Taihang Fifth Military Sub-district Strictly Prevents Grain Smuggling
    [This newspaper, Taihang, 4th dispatch] The Taihang Industrial and Commercial Fifth Sub-bureau recently instructed its subordinate border counties to strictly prevent grain smuggling and strengthen cotton management. Due to the soaring prices in the Chiang-controlled areas, coupled with the Chiang bandits' high-price purchases, a large amount of grain and cotton has been exported from our border areas. Based on the recent major changes in the economic situation in the bandit areas under our counter-offensive situation, the following implementation measures for the economic struggle against the enemy are specifically proposed: 1. Border areas should unify forces to carry out a strong grain protection struggle, resolutely crush the enemy's grain purchasing agencies in our border areas, and eliminate disguised merchants who have infiltrated our border markets. 2. In border areas, our grain prices are low, and there is a lack of essential goods for the masses. Efforts should be organized by various companies, stores, cooperatives, and organ production departments to purchase grain back from the border areas and allocate essential goods to the masses. 3. All counties must strongly manage cotton to prevent it from flowing out freely, and it must be exchanged for essential goods for the masses; otherwise, no outflow will be allowed. All localities must educate the masses to recognize the seriousness of smuggling and consciously rise up to form a mass-based economic struggle against the enemy.

    加强对敌经济斗争
    太行五分区严防粮食走私
    【本报太行四日电】太行工商五分局顷指示所属边地各县、严防粮食走私，加强棉花管理。由于蒋管区物价暴涨，再加蒋匪的高价收买，形成该区边沿粮食、棉花的大批出口，根据匪区最近在我反攻形势下，经济情况的大变化，特提出以下对敌斗争实施办法：一、边地统一力量，开展强有力的护粮斗争，坚决摧垮敌在我边沿的购粮机构，肃清混入我边沿市场的伪装奸商。二、边地我粮价低，群众必需品缺乏，应组织各公司商店、合作社、机关生产部等力量，购回边地粮食，并调剂给群众必需品。三、各县必须强力管理棉花，不使自流，一定要兑回群众必品需，否则，一概不准出境。各地必须宣传教育群众，使其认清走私严重性，自觉起来，形成群众性的对敌经济斗争。
