　　Gaoyi Elementary School Saves 800,000 by Cutting Grass
    [Report from this newspaper] In addition to turning the area around the city walls into flat land for planting vegetables, Gaoyi Elementary School also proposed cutting grass to solve the difficulty of firewood for the winter. All teachers and students worked together, taking sickles to cut grass outside the city after meals. In the four-and-a-half-day blitz, most of the plan was completed (previously the plan was 400 jin of dry grass per person). For example, the second group of eight people cut 3,500 jin, averaging 438 jin per person. At three jin per person per day, this is enough to burn for four months and twenty-six days. It is estimated that the whole school can burn for four months. This can save 800,000 yuan (previously buying firewood cost 200,000 yuan per month). Under the influence of the grass cutting at Gaoyi Elementary School, the villagers have also started cutting grass. (Gaoxiao Communications Group)

　　高邑高小割草节约八十万
    【本报讯】高邑高小校，除把城墙周围开成平地种上蔬菜外，并提出割草解决冬季烧柴困难。全体师生一齐动手，每到饭后都拿着镰刀往城外去割，在四天半突击中大部完成计划（以前计划每人四百斤干草）。如第二组八个人割了三千五百斤，每人平均四三八斤，以每日每人用三斤计，能烧四个月零二十六天，全校计算也能烧四个月。可节约八十万元，（以前买柴烧每月二十万元）在高小校的割草影响下，老乡们也都割开了。（高小通讯组）
