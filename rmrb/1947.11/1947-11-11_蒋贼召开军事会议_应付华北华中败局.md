Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 6th: Chiang Kai-shek has held a military conference with Chiang's Shandong Province Chairman Wang Yaowu, Anhui Province Chairman Li Pinxian, and Hebei Province Chairman Sun Lianzhong, who recently arrived in Nanjing, to discuss how to deal with the dangerous situation of Chiang's troops in North China and within Jiangsu, Shandong, and Anhui, due to the victorious offensives of the People's Liberation Army. The Associated Press stated that the rapidly advancing People's Liberation Army is charging through vast areas of northern Central China. The (Chiang) government spokesman admitted that nearly 100,000 communist troops have appeared in the Shandong occupied areas, which the government (Chiang's) troops had greatly publicized as "cleared" just a few weeks ago. The summoning of the Chiang's chairmen of the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Anhui to Nanjing shows that the Chiang government has failed to control the development of the situation in these areas.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 7th, Chiang Kai-shek is deeply alarmed by the vigorous activities of the Jiangnan People's Armed Forces in the heart of his ruling area. Chiang's Jiangsu Provincial Garrison Command suspects that the People's Armed Forces will launch a "large-scale road destruction campaign" and is now planning to implement special joint military and police "patrols" in the Nanjing-Shanghai railway area. Furthermore, according to a dispatch from Nanjing by the same agency on the 8th, the Guangdong Chiang bandits are also panicking due to the active presence of powerful People's Armed Forces in the province, and have applied for the establishment of ten self-defense corps to "assist in suppressing" the People's Armed Forces. This plan has been approved by the Nanjing Chiang Kai-shek government.

　　蒋贼召开军事会议
    应付华北华中败局
    【新华社陕北八日电】据美联社南京六日消息：蒋介石已与新近抵达南京之蒋匪山东省主席王耀武、安徽省主席李品仙及河北省主席孙连仲等人举行军事会议，讨论应付蒋军在华北及苏鲁皖境内，因人民解放军胜利攻势而处的危险形势。美联社称：进展迅速的人民解放军，正横冲直闯于华中北部广大地区。（蒋）政府发言人承认，近十万的共军，已出现于仅在数周前政府（蒋）军大肆宣传已“肃清”的山东占领区。冀鲁皖三省蒋记主席之被召到南京，显示出蒋政府未能控制这些地区的形势发展。
    【新华社陕北九日电】据美联社南京七日电透露：蒋匪对在其统治心脏地带猛烈活动的江南人民武装深表惊恐，蒋记江苏省警备司令部猜测人民武装将作“大规模破路运动”，现正计划于京沪路地区实行特殊的军警联合“巡逻”。又据该社八日宁电透露，广东蒋匪亦因该省强大人民武装的活跃而大起恐慌，申请成立十个自卫团“助剿”人民武装；此计划南京蒋匪政府已予批准。
