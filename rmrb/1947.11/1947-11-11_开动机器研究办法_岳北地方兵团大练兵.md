Mobilizing Brainpower to Study Methods
　　Yuebei Local Military District Launches Large-Scale Military Training
[Our Newspaper Taiyue, 9th Dispatch] The "26" unit of the Yuebei Local Military District has launched a mass movement of using brainpower during its large-scale military training after receiving new recruits, creating many experiences: (1) On-the-spot commentary, allowing a squad or platoon of soldiers to conduct exercises, with the remaining soldiers observing. In various enemy situations and terrains, "How would you act?" "What do you do now that the enemy has discovered you?" "What do you do when you are only fifty meters away from the enemy?" At the same time, organize the observing soldiers to comment on various actions and offer their own opinions. After the exercise, conduct a general discussion to reach a unified conclusion. This method can not only promote the creativity of the soldiers, but also enable the soldiers to have a deep understanding of the problems. (2) The masses study the experiences of the masses. For example, in attacking bunkers, the soldiers did not understand what bunkers were and how to attack them, so they were somewhat afraid of bunkers. Later, the method of soldiers attacking and soldiers defending was adopted to allow them to understand the entire process of attack and defense. At the same time, the defenders had to constantly tell the attackers the specific situation, such as "Now I have discovered you, go down and you will not be seen!" "Run a few more meters and you won't be seen!" After the battle, everyone studied together, gained experience, and realized that the bunkers had a narrow firing range, many blind spots, what distance was the danger zone, when to crawl and when to run when passing through, and the closer you got, the less afraid you were. During the night exercise, the bunker defenders constantly emitted sparks from the gun holes to indicate firing, giving the attackers a lot of experience in discovering bunkers at night. Once, the bunker defender was notifying that the enemy had been discovered, but another enemy had already rushed onto the bunker cover and threw in a grenade. After the battle, everyone gained experience again, that is, what distance could the sound of footsteps be heard, simultaneous attacks from both sides confused the target, and it was easier to approach the enemy. Finally, everyone studied three methods of attacking bunkers, eliminating the fear of bunkers.
　　
[Our Newspaper Taiyue, 8th Dispatch] The 25th unit of the Yuebei Local Military District, after receiving a large number of emancipated peasants into the army last month, began large-scale military training on the 23rd. In the past week, the new soldiers have learned the four major techniques in fortress assault warfare: demolition, bunker busting, bridge building, and ladder construction. During the military training, cadres and soldiers, new soldiers and veteran soldiers, all used their brains to think of ways, creating a mass military training movement. It took a large detachment 120 seconds to build a bridge at the beginning, but after the third company invented the millstone method, it only took eight seconds to build it. It took the third detachment 130 seconds to build a ladder on the first day, but they finally gained experience in coordinated action, and the entire action of bridge and ladder construction, passing through 50 meters of complex terrain, only took 85 seconds. The entire regiment has now created three ways to build ladders and bridges, which are applicable to various terrains and material conditions. The demolition group initially lacked common sense about ladder construction, etc. Later, they held a joint investigation meeting with the liberated soldiers to understand that the enemy had more than six types of constructions, such as electric mines and foot mines, and further studied ways to deal with them, which resulted in great success. The bunker busting group created a method of on-the-spot commentary, constructing various concealed bunkers on various terrains, allowing the soldiers to defend them personally, and inspiring the soldiers to comment on the merits and demerits of various actions. Finally, they created three methods of attacking bunkers, and the fear of bunkers gradually disappeared.

　　开动机器研究办法
  　岳北地方兵团大练兵
    【本报太岳九日电】岳北地方兵团“二六”部队，在接受新战士后的大练兵中，开展了群众性用脑筋运动，创造了不少经验：（一）实地评论，让一班或一排战士进行演习，其余战士旁观，在各种敌情和地形中，你如何动作，“现在敌人发觉你了如何办？”“离敌人只有五十公尺了怎么办？”同时组织旁观战士评论各种动作，并提出自己的意见，演习结束后，再来一次总讨论，得出一致的结论。此种办法一方面能发扬战士的创造，另一方面使战士对问题接受的深刻。（二）群众研究群众经验，如在打地堡中，战士们不了解地堡是怎样个东西，如何打法，所以对地堡都有些害怕，后来采用了战士攻战士守的办法，使他们了解攻守的全部过程，同时守的人要不断的告诉攻的人具体情况，如“现在我发觉你了，爬下去就看不见了！”“再跑几公尺就看不了！”战斗结束后，大家共同研究，得出经验，认识了地堡的火力范围窄小，死角多，什么距离是危险界，通过时何时爬，何时跑，越近越不怕等等。夜间演习时，守堡人不断从枪眼里冒出火星来，表示打枪，给攻堡人许多夜间发现地堡的经验，有一次守堡人正在通知已经发现敌人，不防另一面敌人已经冲上地堡盖，打进了手榴弹，战斗结束后，大家又得出经验，即什么距离才能听见脚步声，两面同时进攻目标混乱，容易接近敌人，最后大家研究出三种打地堡的办法，消除了对地堡的恐惧心理。
    【本报太岳八日电】岳北地方兵团二五部队，于上月接受大批翻身农民入伍后，二十三日起开始大练兵。一周来，新战士已学得攻坚战中之四大技术：破坏、打地堡、架跳板、搭梯。练兵中，干部与战士，新战士与老战士一齐用脑筋，想办法，造成群众性的练武运动。一大队开始搭跳板时需要一百二十秒钟，自三连发明磨盘法后，只需八秒钟就可搭起。三大队第一天架梯需一百三十秒，最后取得协同动作之经验，与跳板架梯之全部动作，通过五十米的复杂地形只用八十五秒。现全团对架梯搭跳板已创造三种架法，适用于各种地形与物质条件。破坏组开始对架梯等缺乏常识，后来同解放战士共开调查会，了解了敌人有电雷踏雷等六种以上的建筑，并进一步研究出对付的办法，便获得很大成绩。打地堡组创造了实地评论的办法，在各种地形上构筑各种暗堡，让战士们亲自坚守，启发战士评论各项动作的好坏，最后创造了三种打法，于是对地堡的恐惧逐渐消除。
