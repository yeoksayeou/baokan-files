　　Tinghepu Cooperative
    Weaving and Grain Transport Bring Extra Income
    [Our newspaper, Licheng, news] Tinghepu Village, in the Second District, during this anti-offensive grain transport campaign, in addition to ideological education, the cooperative first made preparations to organize income-generating side jobs. The whole village transported a total of 12,000 jin of grain, using 60 livestock and 16 carts. The plan was to bring back 6,200 jin of iron, earning 25 yuan per jin, for a total profit of 155,000 yuan. They also planned to transport 7,000 jin of flower seeds from Diyu at Changjiaodi, earning 10 yuan per jin, for a total profit of 70,000 yuan. They also planned to transport 300 jin of salt from Yangyi, earning 20 yuan per jin, for a total profit of 6,000 yuan, bringing the total profit to 231,000 yuan. Under the principle of thrift, the masses were mobilized to "sell less on the road and bring more from home." People carried rice, and livestock carried fodder. After this calculation, after expenses, they could net 168,000 yuan in transportation fees. After such mobilization, everyone eagerly went to transport grain. For example, Zhang Chunde said, "This grain transport not only supports the front lines but also brings extra income, which is equivalent to working hard for rice and also making money." Everyone also put forward the slogan "Pay attention on the road, ensure that not a single grain is spilled." The whole village formed two teams for grain transport, a cart team and a high-foot team. This grain transport also paid attention to taking care of poor peasants. For example, poor peasants with bad livestock were not asked to go, but were told to produce at home. Immigrant Jia Fuliang was allowed to produce at home because his livestock was bad and he had no travel expenses. Everyone was in high spirits during the grain transport, especially satisfied with the extra income. The masses' reaction was: "Supporting the war effort does not hinder production; it is truly a win-win situation."

    [Our newspaper, Licheng, news] Tinghepu Village in the Second District is located near the Handan-Changzhi Highway. In order to reduce the expenses of the large number of grain transport laborers on the road, and to ensure that they have enough to eat and stay warm, a meeting of liberated peasants was held to discuss the matter. Song Tongming said, "The grain transport laborers are just like us, all working to overthrow the old root Chiang Kai-shek. We must treat them well when they stay in our village." Woman Jin Yindi said, "There will be many people transporting grain on the road this time, and I am afraid they will not be able to buy food and drink. I want to organize women to sell simple meals to solve the difficulty." After discussion, it was decided to establish a Grain Transport Village Command Post to take care of the grain transport laborers, with an Accommodation Group, a Firewood Group, and a Boiling Water Group, each with one cadre, and the village head and political director in charge of the overall command. In addition, the village's cart inns and restaurants were also reformed, and the slogan of not engaging in speculative trading was put forward. The village has a total of seven cart inns and two restaurants. In order to reduce the expenses of the grain transport laborers, a meeting of the heads of each shop was specially convened. After ideological understanding, they all voluntarily switched to selling rice soup and yellow steamed buns, and told the laborers to start more fires. The women of the whole village also organized five meal-selling groups, selling only yellow steamed buns and rice soup. This not only solved the difficulty of having too many grain transporters and not enough food sellers, but also provided a form of production for the women themselves. Because the village's organization and hospitality were very thoughtful, the grain transport laborers did not feel any difficulty staying in the village. For example, an old fellow from Changzhi who was transporting grain said, "I thought there would be many people and horses on the road, and I wouldn't be able to find a shop. Who would have thought that staying here (Tinghepu) would be even better than being at home?" (Dong Kui, Huan Wu, San Xiao, Qi De, Ji Cheng)

　　停河铺合作社
    纺织运粮捎回脚
    【本报黎城讯】二区停河铺村，在这次运反攻粮的运动中，除思想教育外，合作社首先作了准备，组织捎回脚。全村共运粮一万二千斤，共用畜力六十个，大车十六辆，计划往回捎铁六千二百斤，每斤二十五元，能赚洋十五万五千元。从长脚底后狄峪往回运花籽七千斤，每斤十元能赚洋七万元。从阳邑往回运盐三百斤，每斤二十元赚洋六千元，总共赚洋二十三万一千元。在节约的原则下，发动群众“路上少卖在家多带”，人带米牲口带草料，这样计算一下，除开支能净赚脚钱十六万八千元。经这样发动后，大家争先恐后的去运粮。如张春德说：“这次运粮不但支援前线，还能往回捎脚，顶了勤工米，还能赚钱”，大家并提出“在路上要注意，保证不撒一粒粮”的口号，全村运粮共组城二个队，大车一队，高脚一队，这次运粮中并注意照顾贫农，如对贫农的歹牲口不叫他去，叫他在家生产。移民贾富良因牲口歹又无盘川钱，就让他在家生产。运粮中大家情绪极高，特别是对捎回脚都很满意，群众的反映是：支差不误生产，真是一举两得。

    【本报黎城讯】二区停河铺村靠邯长公路，为了使大批运粮民工在路上减少开支，能吃饱住暖，召开翻身农民会研究，宋通明说：“运粮的民工和咱一样，都是为了刨倒老根蒋介石，住在咱村一定要好好招待。”妇女金引弟说：“这次运粮路上人多，怕买不到吃喝，我要组织妇女卖便饭来解决困难。”经讨论后，决成立运粮村指挥所，专照顾运粮民工，下设住宿股、柴草股、烧水股，各股下设干事一人，总指挥所有村长政治主任负责。此外对本村的车马店与饭铺，也进行了改造，提出不做投机买卖的口号。该村共七座车店，两座饭铺，为了减少运粮民工开支，特召开了各店的负责人会议，从思想上打通，他们都自动一律改卖米汤、黄蒸，并叫民工多起火。全村妇女又组织五个卖饭小组，单卖黄蒸、米汤，这样不但解决了运粮人多卖饭少的困难，而对妇女本身也是一种生产。由于该村的组织招待十分周到，使运粮民工住在该村感不到一点困难。如长治一个运粮老乡说：“我在家想走到路上人马多，找不到店，谁想住到这里（停河铺），比在家还强。”（东魁、换武、三销、起德、记成）
