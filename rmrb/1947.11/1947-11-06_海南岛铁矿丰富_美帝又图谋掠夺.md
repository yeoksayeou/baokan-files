Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. While U.S. imperialism is seizing our Hainan Island's fisheries, it is also actively plotting to plunder the island's iron ore. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo on the 29th, American "steel experts" generally believe that Hainan Island could be developed into one of the world's largest steel bases. Perryshee, the export manager of the Southwestern Iron Company of the United States, who is currently in Japan as a private trader to conduct inspections, expressed his covetousness. He told a Chiang Kai-shek Central News Agency reporter that if the Chiang bandit government provided "guarantees for the protection of investment and operation," he would "not hesitate to immediately establish a steel rolling mill in Hainan Island equipped with completely modern equipment." Perryshee said that Hainan Island currently has 200,000 tons of iron ore outcrops available for immediate use, and the minimum mining volume could be 500,000 tons per year. Perryshee admitted: "Preliminary discussions are currently underway with the Chinese government (referring to the Chiang bandit gang) regarding the immediate purchase of 100,000 tons of iron ore outcrops from Hainan Island," and stated that this batch of iron ore outcrops would either be transported to Japan to be refined into iron and then resold to the Japanese government, or even resold to China. Perryshee plans to come to China for a "sightseeing tour" before returning to the United States.

    海南岛铁矿丰富
    美帝又图谋掠夺
    【新华社陕北四日电】美帝国主义在其攫取我海南岛渔业同时，又积极图谋掠夺该岛之铁矿。据中央社东京二十九日电报导：美国“钢铁专家”咸认海南岛可能被发展为世界最大钢铁基地之一，刻以私人贸易商身份至日本考察之美国西南辗铁公司出口经理柏里希对此表示馋涎欲滴，彼单独告蒋记中央社记者称：如果蒋匪政府俾予“保护投资及经营之保证”，渠将“毫不犹豫，立即在海南岛设立备有完全现代设备之辗铁厂”。柏里希说：海南岛目前存有铁矿苗二十万吨，可供即时之用，采矿量每年最低限度可能有五十万吨。柏里希承认：“对于立即自海南岛采购铁矿苗十万吨之初步谈商，目前正经中国政府（指蒋匪）进行中”并谓，此批铁矿苗或转运至日本，俾在日炼成铁后转售与日本政府，或甚至再售予中国。柏里希拟于返美前来中国“观光”。
