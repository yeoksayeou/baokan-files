    The Unyielding Guo Tang Village
    Li Yunchuan
    "Guo Tang is the worst. The whole village are all Eighth Route Army men, very resolute. We must kill two of them!" The puppet district chief "Cui the Bad" of the eighth district of Wen Shang cursed like this whenever Guo Tang was mentioned, because when Chiang's Fifth Army passed through twice, no one in Guo Tang supported it. Cui the Bad had personally arrested 107 people in Guo Tang, but never obtained a single gun, bullet, grain, or silver dollar.
    Guo Tang is located on the north side, close to the Yun (cheng)-Wen (shang) highway. It is a relatively "red" village in the first district of Nanwang County. It has indeed gained a lot of experience in the long-term war of attrition and guerrilla warfare. As soon as there was talk of guerrilla warfare, the village's various organizations would start mobilization meetings. The people of the whole village knew how to hide things and how to avoid the enemy when they came, and would never betray the village to the enemy even to death. They also knew that only in this way could the village suffer little or no loss. After the guerrilla warfare began, the village immediately established mass intelligence networks. The branch became the district's secret intelligence station and the village's battle command post. When the situation became tight, they moved to the sorghum fields or among the graves. They knew that when the situation was tight, bad guys would take the opportunity to be active, so they left people in the village to secretly persevere, monitor the landlords, and promptly suppress their opportunistic activities. In several wars of attrition, they killed Zhang Zhao Fu, who was an undercover agent and started rumors, the secret agents Wang Li Ting, Wang Zheng Shan, Wang Li Fu, and Zhang Zhao De, a member of the "Homecoming Corps" who took the opportunity to return home. Therefore, Guo Tang always maintained the order of the peasants.
    The enemy really hated Guo Tang. On September 10th, a unit of the enemy's 72nd Division, together with about two hundred members of the "Homecoming Corps," surrounded Guo Tang Village at lunchtime. They gathered more than a thousand people in a large field. Without saying a word, they first grabbed two people, wrapped them in paper, stuffed them into the mouth of a guillotine and asked, "Who is the village cadre? Who is the militiaman?" Cui Xuzao and Meng Zhaoyin, who were tied to the mouth of the guillotine, bluntly replied, "They all went with the district!"
    "They didn't leave. The deputy leader of the self-defense force, the militia squad leader, and several militiamen, including Liu Peng, Zhang Xiao, and Liu Ke, are all at home." An enemy read the names of the people on a small notebook that had been written in advance.
    "If they're at home, you can arrest them. I don't know." Cui Xuzao answered before Meng Zhaoyin could open his mouth. The enemy couldn't stand this answer anymore and was about to start the guillotine. Village Chief Lu Chaoju saw that if he didn't speak, two lives would be lost. He bravely said, "I am the newly appointed village chief. They don't do anything. Let...!" Before he could finish speaking, with a bang, a group of beasts surrounded him, kicking him, tying him with ropes, and beating him with clubs and rifle butts, telling him to identify those on the list from the crowd. At this time, the village chief looked at many farmer association members and militia who had not left, as well as the district's quartermaster, all with their heads lowered and faces as white as paper. He thought, "You are all afraid, I can't let one person be alone, I can't let two people be cold." He turned to the enemy and said:
    "There isn't one here!"
    "If you refuse to admit, we will beat you resolutely."
    Clubs and ropes rained down again. Platoon Leader Zhang Zhaojin and several old men, seeing that the village chief was about to be beaten to death, pleaded with the enemy to lead them to their homes to search. The enemy agreed and followed the village chief and several others. As soon as they reached the street, they saw Liu Peng and others at the head of the street. They were shocked and secretly cursed their bad luck, when they suddenly heard the village chief shout, "The water you were told to boil, why haven't you carried it over yet? I'm taking the commanders to find Liu Peng!" Liu Peng, hearing that they were looking for him, ran away in a puff of smoke.
    The enemy followed the village chief and others, searched several homes and found nothing but a few pots and bowls. The enemy was even more annoyed. They pulled out thirteen people from the crowd and hung them up, taking turns beating them. But no matter how much their heads were broken and bones were injured, they couldn't beat out a word they wanted to hear.
    As it got dark, the enemy's initial arrogance helplessly disappeared. They had no choice but to take two people with them, announcing before leaving, "We'll spare you for now. If you don't send the people to Fanzhuang (an enemy stronghold, eight miles from Guo Tang) within three days, we'll wash this village next time."

    顽强不屈的郭堂村
    李云川
    “郭堂最坏，全村都是八路，很坚决，非杀两个不行!”汶上八区伪区长“崔坏水”，一提起郭堂就这样发恨，因为蒋五军两次过境，郭堂没有一个人支应它，崔坏水曾亲自到郭堂抓了一百零七个人，总未得到一枪、一弹，或一粒粮食、一块现洋。
    郭堂紧靠郓（城）汶（上）公路的北边，是南旺县一区比较红的村子，它在长期的拉锯游击中，确实有了不少经验，一说要游击，村里各组织即开动员会，全村的人们也就都知道敌人来了如何藏东西、如何躲避敌人，至死不向敌人告密；也知道只有这样，村里才能不受或少受点损失。游击了，村里马上也就建立起大众情报来，支部便成了区的秘密情报站和村里的战斗指挥所。情况紧了，他们就移到高梁地里或坟头间，他们知道情况一紧，坏蛋就会乘机活动，他们就有人留村秘密坚持，监视地主，及时镇压了地主的乘机活动。几次拉锯中，他们曾杀了暗探造谣的张兆福、特务王立亭、王正善、王立福，及乘机回家的“还乡团”张兆德，因此，郭堂始终保持着农民的秩序。
    敌人真的恨透了郭堂，九月十日，敌七二师一部会合“还乡团”约二百余人，吃午饭的时候，把郭堂村包围起来，在一个大场里，集合了千余人，二话不提，先抓了两个人用箔卷上填在铡口里问：“谁是村干？谁是民兵？”被捆在铡口里的崔绪早、孟照银却都干脆回答：“他们都跟区里走了！”
    “没有走，自卫队长副队长、民兵班长，还有刘朋、张笑、刘科几个民兵都在家”。一个敌人念着事前写在小本上的人名。
    “在家您抓去，我不知道”崔绪早没等孟照银张嘴抢先回答了。敌人对这回答，再也耐不住了，就要动铡。村长吕朝居一看再不说话，两条人命就完了，他随勇敢的说：“我是新当的村长，他两个啥也不干，放……！”话没说完，轰的一声，一群野兽把他围起来，你一脚，一他绳，棍子枪托乱打了一阵，叫他从人群中认出在名单上的那几个人来。这时，村长看着好多农会员和未走的民兵，还有区里司务长一个个都低着头，脸象纸白，他想：您都不忙怕，我能叫一人单，不叫二人寒。转脸向敌人说：
    “这里没有一个！”
    “坚决就打，你这个没有一个”。
    棍子、绳子又是一阵乱打，排长张兆谨和几个老头看着村长快被打死了，随向敌人央求着，领他们到家去找。敌人同意了，跟在村长几个人的后面，刚走到街上，顶头看见了刘朋几个人，心里都吓了一跳，暗叫倒霉猛听村长喊：“叫你烧的水呢？还不快点担去，俺领老总们找刘朋去哩！”刘朋听着要找他，一淄烟跑了。
    敌人跟着村长等几个人，走了几家除有几个锅碗外，什么也找不到，敌人更恼了，回来从人群中拉出十三个人，吊起来轮着打。但任你打的头破血流骨头伤，也总打不出一句他们愿意听的话来。
    天黑了，敌人来时的威风无可奈何的消失了，只好带着两个人，临走宣布“今天暂侥您，限三天如不把人抢送到范庄（敌据点，距郭堂八里），下次来洗你这个村。”
