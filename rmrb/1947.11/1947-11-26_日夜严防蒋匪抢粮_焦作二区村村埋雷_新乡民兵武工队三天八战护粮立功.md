　　Day and Night, Strictly Guarding Against Chiang Kai-shek Bandits Seizing Grain
　　焦作 Second District Villages Lay Mines Everywhere
　　Xinxiang Militia and Armed Work Teams Score Merit in Eight Battles in Three Days Protecting Grain
　　[This newspaper, 焦作 News] The Second District utilizes explosions in every village, everyone uses stone mines, establishing minefields, and implementing an explosion campaign to protect grain. The entire puppet self-defense corps of ten villages including 阎河, 上白作, 李封, etc., cooperating with the bandit Wang Fengyin's unit and the returning home corps totaling more than 1,300 people, arrived at the mountainous 焦作 Second District areas of 栗井, 大凹, 东河道 early in the morning of November 3 to seize grain. The enemy, like starving dogs, searched everywhere, taking whatever they found, even rags and cabbage. Our 太南 detachment, combining with the militia around 栗井 and 马蹄沟, laid a minefield. Taking advantage of the enemy's panic, at the sound of the signal, they charged at the enemy. The enemies scattered in confusion. For a while, landmines exploded everywhere, turning the enemy's grain-snatching team into a stretcher team, with some pulling and some dragging, desperately scurrying back. Each armed unit immediately used sniper fire to pursue, chasing the enemy all the way back to their lair. The masses all said, "This battle was really well-fought. Next time, bury more mines." In this engagement, a total of 48 enemies were killed and 2 were injured, and one bag of wheat was recovered. (焦作 City Headquarters, 宏泉, 汉甫, 志中, 俊卿)
　　[This newspaper, 太行, 24th dispatch] The Xinxiang Armed Work Team and the broad masses of militia continuously fiercely attacked Chiang Kai-shek bandits of the 41st Division and the Xinxiang, 汲县, 获嘉 security regiments, "Returning Home Teams," traitors, etc., who were seizing our grain. In three days, they fought eight battles, killing and wounding 21 enemies below the rank of platoon leader of the 41st Division, capturing five traitors alive, and recovering 700 catties of cotton, 20 livestock, and other property. On the 3rd of this month, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits of the 41st Division stationed in Xinxiang, 辉县, and 汲县, cooperating with puppet security regiments, returning home teams, etc., totaling more than 2,000 people, launched a grain grab towards 杨闾川, 辉县. Our First District Armed Work Team persisted in fighting on 燕窝山 for a day, preventing the enemy from succeeding in their invasion. The next day, the enemy turned to 滑峪 and 北岭 to plunder. Our armed work team, in coordination with the 辉县 District cadre team militia, formed a strong defense line. The enemy used mortars and machine guns to cover their infantry, launching three consecutive charges, but were all repelled by our 北岭 militia, and six enemies were killed and wounded. Another unit of the armed work team, led by District Chief Zhao, charged into 滑峪 Village with the force of a tiger descending the mountain, scattering the enemy who were looting, and seizing 700 catties of cotton, two carts, and a portion of clothing, covering the masses in burying all public grain. On the 5th of this month, another group of more than 1,000 Chiang Kai-shek bandits launched an invasion from 获嘉, seizing grain in our 师庄 area. Comrade Li of the Fourth District Branch personally led a portion of the armed work team members and the militia, launching a fierce battle against the enemy at 小河堤, repelling four enemy assaults in a row, killing seven enemies, capturing five alive, and seizing two guns, 21 livestock, and 15 quilts. In order to reward the meritorious militia and armed work teams in the battles of 滑峪 and 师庄, the Xinxiang County Headquarters specially awarded them a collective merit.
