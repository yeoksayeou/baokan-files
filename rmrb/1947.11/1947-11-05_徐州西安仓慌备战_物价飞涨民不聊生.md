Xinhua News Agency, East China, 1st: In Xuzhou, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits are actively preparing for street fighting. They are rushing to build fortifications on streets and alleys, bridgeheads, and road junctions, and even the outer trenches from the Japanese occupation period are being re-excavated. At each intersection, in addition to police and military police, two more infantry sentries have been added, and two citizens are forced to accompany them to embolden them. The people are panic-stricken, and prices are soaring. On September 30th, foreign cloth was 400,000 yuan per piece, but by October 5th, it had risen to 700,000 yuan. Someone went to a store to buy cloth and asked for a price of 9,000 yuan. By the time he had stepped next door to inquire about the price of cloth and returned, it had risen to 10,000 yuan per foot. Citizens mock Chiang Kai-shek's currency like this: "One thousand, two thousand, light a cigarette; ten thousand, twenty thousand, drink a bowl of porridge." In Chiang Kai-shek's occupied Xinpu (near Haizhou), from October 10th to 16th, sesame oil rose from 10,000 yuan per catty to 15,000 yuan, and silver dollars rose from 18,000 yuan to 28,000 yuan per dollar. Grain is available without a market. Grain robbery cases have occurred one after another. The largest was on October 15th, when more than a thousand citizens responded to a call and robbed all the rice stored in the city's major rice shops. Although the Chiang government threatened and suppressed them in many ways, it was ineffective.
    
Our newspaper, Taiyue, 31st: Frontline news from Southern Shanxi: Xi'an, the old nest of the Hu bandits, has become an uneasy city. In panic, the Hu bandits are desperately rushing to build fortifications. All students, workers, women, and children in the city are forced to perform two hours of "voluntary labor" every day, digging fortifications or transporting military supplies to transportation stations. Since October 17th, 40,000 men and women have been doing hard labor every day under the threat of bayonets. All private cars and carriages are under military management after the "general mobilization meeting." Bureaucratic capital, such as the metal factory on Zhongshan Avenue, etc., previously moved along the Xi (an)-Jing (Ziguan) highway towards Hubei. Now, because Shangnan has been liberated by us, it has changed direction and fled to Laohekou and Chongqing. The families of Hu bandit military officers are also carrying large amounts of property and fleeing to Sichuan and Gansu.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: The Tianjin Dagong Bao recently published a communication entitled "The Whole Family is in the Autumn Wind," revealing the decline of commerce and the impoverishment of the people's lives in Tianjin, stating: "Several Western clothing stores are deserted. The shop assistants are propping up their chins and calculating idly with abacuses. When they see someone push the door open, they are flattered and rush forward to welcome them. Prices are rising terribly. Shanghai flannel costs more than 1.5 million yuan per suit, and English serge costs 2.4 million yuan. A coat costs at least 2 million yuan to 6 million yuan. Sheng Xifu's felt hats: American fur velvet ones cost 1.2 million yuan, ties cost from 60,000 to 300,000 yuan each, and leather shoes that cost more than 200,000 yuan are wearable. All in all, from head to toe, without being too particular, just to be "decent," it will cost at least 10 to 8 million yuan. Now the general civil servants' salaries are about 600,000 to 700,000 yuan per month; department chiefs and above get just over 1 million yuan; university professors get at most 2 million yuan. They have trouble feeding their parents, wives, and children cornmeal, so where do they have the extra money to buy clothes? Not to mention Western suits, sewing a cotton robe will also use half a month's salary; a family changing into a pair of cotton shoes will also cost a quarter of their entire salary. Therefore, Mr. Zigang's "Visiting Professors in the Autumn Wind" wrote: Professor Yuan Jiahua has not made new clothes for ten years and has not changed new shoes for four years. Today, I really don't know how many people have not added new clothes or changed new shoes for ten years. Behind the magnificent windows and the dazzling neon lights, the bosses in Tianjin are worried about the sluggish business. The bustling crowd is excluded from the door; this proves the poverty of the city."

    徐州西安仓慌备战
    物价飞涨民不聊生
    【新华社华东一日电】徐州蒋匪积极准备巷战，大街小巷，桥头路口，均赶修工事，连日寇占领时期之外壕，亦重新修挖。每一路口，除警察宪兵外，增加步兵岗哨二人，并逼令市民二人陪伴壮胆。人心惶恐，物价飞涨不已。九月三十日洋布每匹四十万元，至十月五日即涨达七十万元。有人往商店买布，问价九千元，待他跨向邻店打听布价再回来时，每尺已涨至一万元了。市民这样嘲笑蒋币：“一千两千，吸支香烟，一万两万，喝碗稀饭。”蒋占之新浦（海州附近）十月十日至十六日中，生油由每斤万元涨至万五千元，银洋兑换由每元换一万八千元涨至两万八千元。粮食则有行无市。抢粮案件，接连发生。最大者为十月十五日，千余市民一呼百应，将全市各大米行存米抢光，蒋政府虽多方恐吓弹压，均属无效。
    【本报太岳三十一日电】晋南前线讯：胡匪老巢西安已成为一座不安的城市，胡匪在恐慌中拼命赶修工事，全市学生、工人、妇女、儿童每人每日强迫“义务劳动”两小时，进行挖工事，或往运输站搬运军用物资。自十月十七日起，每日均有四万男女在刺刀的威迫下作苦工。所有私营汽车及马车在“总动员会”后，一律受军事管理。官僚资本如中山大街的金属厂等以前沿西（安）荆（紫关）公路向湖北转移，现因商南被我解放后改向老河口、重庆流亡。胡匪军官家属亦携带大批财物向四川、甘肃逃亡。
    【新华社陕北一日电】天津大公报近载“全家都在秋风里”通讯，披露天津商业凋敝，人民生活穷困情形称：几家洋服店都是冷清清的，店里伙计们支着下巴无聊地在摸算盘，看见有人推门进来，就受宠若惊地上前欢迎。物价涨得可怕，上海法兰绒每套要一百五十多万元，英国哗叽二百四十万元。一件大衣则从二百万元起码到六百多万元。盛锡福的呢帽：美国货皮绒的要一百二十万元，领带从六、七万到三十多万元一根，皮鞋要上二十万的才能穿，算起来，从头到脚不必太考究，只是“体面”一下，非上个千八百万元不行，现在一般公务人员的薪水每月大概六、七十万元；科长以上才一百多万元；大学教授最高不过二百万元。他们有父母、妻、子吃棒子面都成问题，那里有余力来购买衣服。不说西服，缝一件棉袍，也要用去半月的薪金；一家人换上一双棉鞋也得化去全部薪金的四分之一。所以子冈先生的“秋风里访教授”一文写着：袁家骅教授十年不曾制新衣，四年不曾换新鞋，今天真不知道有多少十年不曾添过新衣服，换过新鞋的人。在富丽堂皇的橱窗，和光怪陆离的霓红灯后面，天津的老板们正看着清淡的生意发愁，熙攘的人群被摒诸门外；这就证明了都市的贫穷。
