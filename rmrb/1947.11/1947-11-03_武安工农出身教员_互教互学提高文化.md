Wuan Teachers from Worker-Peasant Backgrounds
Improve Their Literacy Through Mutual Teaching and Learning
[This newspaper Wuan news] After the rectification in the education sector of Wuan, in addition to replenishing a batch of liberated young people trained in normal schools, the masses in each village earnestly selected liberated people who worked for them to serve as teachers. The masses' view of teachers is different from the past; they know that the new teachers are working for them, and they also care about the schools. Most of the teachers are from poor peasant and worker backgrounds, and they are very enthusiastic about their work, only afraid that the masses will not be able to achieve liberation in culture. However, the literacy of these new teachers is low, and they feel difficulties in teaching. At the beginning of the eighth month of the lunar calendar, the teachers from the fifth district first proposed: Taking advantage of the masses' autumn harvest, teachers should stop classes, and concentrate in the high primary school by district to open small "teacher training classes" to learn culture and exchange experiences. After this method was proposed, each district took different holidays according to the early or late harvest of crops, with a learning time of half a month to twenty days. The content of the study was determined according to the needs of the masses to formulate a study plan. Under the slogan of "learn from each other's strengths to offset weaknesses" and "mutual teaching and mutual learning", teachers generated teachers among themselves. Whoever knew a little would teach that little. The spirit of class friendship among the teachers reached its highest level. For example, Yang Fengqing, a teacher from Diantou Village in the eighth district, served as an arithmetic teacher in the eighth district training class. During class, he explained carefully again and again, only ending the class when everyone fully understood. Li Chuntao was in charge of geography, and got up in the middle of the night to prepare materials. The teachers did not know how to look up dictionaries, so Kong Fanji from the tenth district and Li Kuan, the director of general affairs of the eighth high school, took the trouble to research and come up with a simple way to look up dictionaries. When teachers in the ninth district were helping military families with the autumn harvest at Qingyan Temple, they also studied and learned. Now the learning in six districts has ended. The teachers understood simple geography (the situation of China), integer arithmetic, and general knowledge. Ji Wenxiang, a teacher in the eighth district, said: "The new society is full of helping people to progress, while the old society was just afraid that us poor people would learn skills."

    武安工农出身教员
    互教互学提高文化
    【本报武安讯】武安教育界进行整顿后，除补充了一批师范培养出来的翻身青年外，各村群众都认真地选聘了和自己办事的翻身群众当教员。群众对教员的看法，和过去不同了，知道新教员是为自己办事的，对学校也关心了。教员多贫雇工农出身，对工作很热心，只恐怕群众在文化上翻不了身。但这批新教员文化低，教学中感到困难。阴历八月初，首由五区教员群众们提出：趁群众秋收时，教员停止上课，以区为单位，集中到高小，开小型的“教员训练班”学习文化，交流经验。这个办法提出后，各区按庄稼收割迟早，不同的放假，学习时间半月至二十天，学习的内容根据群众的需要，订出学习计划。在“截长补短”“互教互学”的口号下，教员中产生了先生，谁会那一点就教那一点，教员们的阶级友爱精神，达到最高度。象八区店头村教员杨丰清，在八区训练班担任算术教员，上课时细致的讲了又讲，只等大家完全明白才下堂。李春涛担任地理，半夜起来准备材料。教员们不会找字典，十区孔繁继，八高事务长李宽，都费心研究出找字典的简便办法。九区教员在青烟寺帮助军属收秋时，还研究学习。现在有六个区学习已结束。教员们明白了简单地理（中国形势）、整数四则和普通常识等，八区教员藉文祥说：“新社会到处是帮助人进步的，旧社会是光怕咱穷人学会了本事哩。”（文珊）
