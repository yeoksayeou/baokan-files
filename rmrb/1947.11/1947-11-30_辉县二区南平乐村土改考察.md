　　Land Reform Investigation in Nanpingle Village, Er District, Huixian County
    Taihang Fifth District Party Committee Office
    Nanpingle Village in the Er District of Huixian County is a large village with 285 households. Since its liberation in 1944, it has undergone seven mass movements, from rent and interest reduction to land reform. In the past, the leadership regarded this village as a typical progressive village. After two consecutive investigations, the following problems were discovered and are presented for reference by various regions.
    One, there is still a long way to go to eliminate the landlord class. Of the eleven landlord households in the village, only eight were struggled against. Of the twenty-four exploiting landlord households, only sixteen were struggled against. Of the twenty-three rich peasant households, only sixteen were struggled against. Superficially, landlords still live in good houses and cultivate more and better land. Twelve exploiting landlord households and sixteen rich peasant households were not struggled against at all during the War of Resistance. For example, Zhang Ziru, an exploiting landlord, has a family of three and cultivates land yielding 21 *shi* of grain, an average of 7 *shi* per person, which is 5.3% higher than the village average.丁国平, an exploiting landlord, has a family of nine and cultivates 51.4 *mu* of land, yielding 57.4 *shi* of grain. In addition to feeding three livestock himself, he also jointly raises five livestock and eight sheep with the villagers. His son is a teacher, earning 120 *jin* of millet per month. His daughter-in-law wears silver jewelry on her hands and head, and their bedding, clothing, and accessories are neat and clean. They have all the furniture and farm tools they need, and the masses still have to beg the landlords to use them. Poor and hired peasants reflect: "The poor are still poor, and the wealthy are still wealthy." "They can grind grain in their own courtyard, while we have to run all over the village to grind a little." "They have everything they need, while we have nothing." "They eat whatever they want, while we eat whatever we have."
    Two, the landlord class still eats and dresses well, while the poor still have no food or clothing, living a poor life. There are still 87 households in the village living in poverty. For example, Hao Guangfu's family of five cultivates land yielding only 3.9 *shi* of grain, less than 8 *dou* per person on average. They have one tattered quilt, one tattered mat, and two rooms. Chang Tiangong, a family of four, produces 5.8 *shi*. Most of his small amount of land was bought during the rent and interest reduction period, when the landlord sold the farthest and worst land to the poor peasants. As hired peasant Wang Tian said: "The wealthy's land is all near the village, but we have to walk for half a day to reach our land, wasting a lot of work time and not being able to harvest more grain." They borrowed grain to buy the land or went without food to buy the land, and have been borrowing ever since, getting worse year by year. Their homes are very empty, almost all with debts. According to statistics from 61 households, 48 households with 134 people have debts. This year, they actually harvested 103 *shi* of grain, but have debts of 81.8 *shi*. Eleven households with 43 people have no housing, eleven households have no cooking pot (borrowing now), twenty-four households have no water jars or vegetable jars, two households with seven or eight people do not have a single quilt, nineteen households with eighty-two people share twenty-two tattered quilts, and twenty-four households with eighty-six people will have great difficulty getting new cotton clothes this winter. Poor peasant Wang Xiwu's family of six lives in a dilapidated thatched hut with a leaking roof. They only have three bowls, so the men eat first, and then the women eat. His ten-year-old daughter is still wearing tattered pants, and his four-year-old daughter has no lower clothing at all. When poor people go out to produce, they only have a carrying pole, while the wealthy all drive livestock. Wang Xifu said: "They say we want to separate from the landlords, but I'm still borrowing a house from Ding's family (exploiting landlord), and I'm still afraid they won't let us live there."
    Three, the reasons why the landlords were not thoroughly struggled against and the poor did not turn over: (1) Landlords who had divided their families were classified as rich peasants or middle peasants. For example, Zhang Dianlin's five brothers owned more than 200 *mu* of land when they were a joint family. During the War of Resistance, they divided the family but still hired long-term laborers and lent money at usurious rates, yet they were classified as middle peasants. Ding Guoping and Ding Guoquan, two brothers, used to work themselves, but they once employed 57 short-term laborers for three or four days and exploited people with high rents and high interest, yet they were classified as laboring rich peasants and were even given a share of the fruits of the struggle. Ding Guoping also has eight livestock. The first time class status was determined in the village, 14 households were classified as landlords, the second time 28 households, and this time 30 households (including exploiting landlords). (2) Fear of struggling against the landlords and causing them to run away. Therefore, the leadership pre-determined that large villages would struggle against seven households, medium-sized villages would struggle against five households, and small villages would struggle against three households. There was no way to avoid struggling against them, and any mistakes in struggling would be returned. During the filling-in process, the masses demanded a thorough accounting, but the village cadres were afraid of making mistakes and ran to report to the higher authorities. The reply was "give them a hand," which did not satisfy the demands of the masses. (3) Cadres have a "close enough" mentality. For example, former village chief (now cooperative director) Zhang Ping said: "The poor all have land to cultivate and houses to live in, that's close enough, the landlords have been thoroughly struggled against." (4) Unfair distribution of the fruits of struggle. Before the filling-in, there was no distinction between rich and poor, and whoever raised an opinion could get something. Some poor and hired peasants were anxious but unable to turn over. Until last winter and this spring, the spirit of "filling in the gaps and making up for what's missing" was not implemented. Instead, all the houses, land, and other things were valued (converted into grain), and each household was graded. If you wanted grain, you couldn't have things, and if you wanted things, grain would be deducted. For example, hired peasant Guo Yansuo was rated as first class and was supposed to receive 7 *shi* of grain. He received half a livestock, which was worth 5 *shi* of grain. Because he had no housing, he wanted three rooms, which were valued at 3 *shi*. In addition to the 7 *shi* he was entitled to, he had to pay back 1 *shi* of grain. Although he had a house and livestock, he had nothing to eat. The distribution was broad. Of the 285 households in the village, 259 households received the fruits of struggle, accounting for more than 90% of the households. Among them, 32 exploiting landlord and rich peasant households received the fruits of struggle, and the difference between them and the middle and poor peasants was not much. In addition, the cooperative, school, militia, etc., used village expenses as an excuse to occupy more than 600,000 *yuan* worth of struggle fruits, 5 *da shi* of grain, 109 pieces of clothing, 10 pieces of furniture, and other cotton, cloth, and quilts. The large amount of fruits of struggle embezzled by village cadres has not yet been counted. Therefore, when distributing the fruits of struggle, the poor and hired peasants said: "We can't get anything and have to discuss it for several days. We don't want it, give it to the military dependents! It's better for us to go to the mountains to cut white grass or go out to engage in production than to distribute the fruits of struggle."

　　辉县二区南平乐村土改考察
    太行五区地委办公室
    辉县二区南平乐村，是二百八十五户的一个大村，四四年解放后，从减租减息到土改，经过了七次群众运动，以往领导上都认为该村是一典型的进步村；最后作了两次的连续考察，发现如下几个问题，提出供各地参考。
    一、消灭地主阶级可还差远哩。全村地主十一户，只斗了八户。经营地主二十四户，只斗了十六户。富农二十三户，只斗了十六户。就从表面上看，地主仍住着好房，种着多而且好的土地。有十二户经地十六户富农和抗战中没斗一样。如经地张自如，人三口种地产量廿一石，每人平均七石，比全村平均数多百分之五．三。经地丁国平，人九口，地五十一亩四，产量五十七石四斗。他除自己喂三头牲口外，还和村上群众伙养五头牲口八只羊，儿子当教员，每月赚一百廿斤小米，儿媳妇还带着满手满头银器，铺的盖的穿的戴的都整整齐齐干干净净；家具农具应有尽有，群众想用仍得乞求地主。贫雇反映：“穷人还是穷人，老财还是老财。”“人家碾磨不出院，咱碾一点全村跑个遍。”“人家用啥有啥，咱使啥没啥。”“人家吃啥有啥，咱是有啥吃啥。”
    二、地主阶级仍是好吃好穿，穷人还是没吃没穿，过着穷时光，全村仍有八十七户过着贫农生活。如郝光福五口人，种地产量只三石九斗，每口平均还不够八斗；家中有一条破被子，铺的一条破席子，二间房。常天功，四口人，产量五石八斗，他的少数土地，大多是在减租减息时期买的，当时地主挑出最远最坏地卖给了贫农。如雇农王田说：“老财地都在庄边，咱往地走走得半天，不少误工，可多收不了粮食。”买地时是借粮买或自己不吃买了地，一直借吃到现在，一年赶不上一年，家中很空，差不多都有窟窿（外债）。据六十一户的统计，有四十八户一百三十四口人有外债，今年实收粮一百零三石，就有外债八十一石八斗。有十一户四十三口人没有房住，有十一户没有做饭锅（现在借用），有二十四户没有水缸菜缸，有两户七八口没有一条被子，有十九户八十二口人伙盖着二十二条破被子，有二十四户八十六口人今冬换棉衣就大成问题。贫农王希文，六口人住着一间露着天的破草屋，三个碗总是男人吃了女人再吃，十岁小闺女现在还是穿着半截破裤子，四岁的小闺女下身就没有穿。穷人出门生产是一条扁担，老财全赶着牲口。王希富说：“光说要和地主分家，我还借住丁家（经地）房子，还怕人家不教咱住哩。”
    三、地主没斗透穷人没翻身的原因：（一）把分了家的地主划成富农、中农，如张典林弟兄五人，老伙时是二百多亩地，抗战中分了家，还雇长工放帐，却划成中农。丁国平、丁国全弟兄二人，过去自己也劳动，可是用短工有一次就用过五十七个人，做了三四天活，还高租大利剥削人，被划成劳动富农，还分果实，丁国平还有八头牲口。全村头次划阶级划了地主十四户，二次划了二十八户，今次又划了三十户（包括经地）。（二）怕把地主斗跑了。因此领导上预先就规定了大村斗七户，中等村斗五户，小村斗三户，没有不斗，斗错了一律退回等。在填补中，群众要求彻底清算，村干部怕犯错误，跑去向上级报，答复是“拉一把”，没有满足了群众的要求。（三）干部存在着差不多思想。如前村长（现合作社社长）张平说：“穷人都有了地种，有了房住啦，差不多了，地主斗透了。”（四）分配果实不公道，在填补前不分穷富，谁提意见谁就能分东西，有些贫雇农民干着急不能翻身。直到去冬今春，还没有贯澈填平补齐“缺啥分啥”的精神，而是把所有的房地等一切东西作价（作成粮食），再把每户评成等级，要粮食就不能要东西了，要东西扣了粮食。如雇农郭言锁评议为一等，该分七石粮，他分了半头牲口折五石粮，因没有房住，要了三间房，作价三石。除应得七石外，还得拿出粮一石。虽有了房子、牲口，可是没有啥吃了。分配面宽。全村二百八十五户，分到果实的二百五十九户，占户口的百分之九十以上。其中还有卅二户经地富农分到果实，而中、贫农分数也差不了多少。再加上合作社、学校、民兵等，以村经费为借口，占用斗争果实六十多万元，粮食五大石，衣服一百零九件，家具十件，及其他棉花、布匹、被子等。村干部贪污的大批果实还未统计起来。因此分配果实时贫雇农说：“分不上东西又得讨论好几天，俺不要了，给了军属吧！俺上山割白草或出外搞一回生产，也比分果实强哩。”
