　　Qingfeng Danping Village
    Cotton and Indigo Harvest
    [Report from this newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu office on the 20th] Danping Village, in the Second District of Qingfeng, has reaped a bumper harvest of cotton and indigo this year, greatly increasing the wealth of the masses. The entire village planted 173 mu of indigo, and after harvesting, threshed more than 2,400 jin. At the market price of 1,700 to 2,000 yuan per jin, it can be sold for a total of 4.6 million yuan. In addition, indigo stalks can also be used as fertilizer, which will also increase the wheat harvest next year. Furthermore, the entire village planted 169 mu of cotton, yielding 100 jin per mu, for a total of 17,000 jin. At the market price of 280 yuan per jin, it can be sold for a total of 4.76 million yuan. This is a substantial income for the masses and can greatly improve their lives. For example, poor peasant Chen Tixiu, who previously had only eight fen of land, received ten mu of land during the land reform. He planted four mu of indigo and harvested seventy or eighty jin, selling it for a total of 148,200 yuan. When planting wheat, he spent 80,000 yuan to buy an ox and also bought some farm tools. Now his enthusiasm for production is even higher. Because the masses in the entire village have obtained substantial profits from agricultural production, they are now further studying and improving cultivation techniques, preparing to plant some scallions and garlic to increase their income.
