　　Xinhua News Agency, East China, 22nd. The local armed forces of the 9th Sub-district of Suzhong, Tongruhaiqi, on the afternoon of the 9th, captured Liuqiao Town, an important stronghold 35 miles north of Nantong city, annihilated the defending enemy, and defeated four battalions of Chiang Kai-shek bandits who came to reinforce from Dingba. A total of more than 350 enemy soldiers, including company commanders and below, were killed or captured, and two 60mm mortars, eight light and heavy machine guns, more than 200 rifles and short guns, and more than 40,000 rounds of ammunition were seized. Taking advantage of the victory, they once again removed six strongholds including Xialimiao, directly threatening Nantong city. Note: Since the 30th of last month, the local armed forces have been sweeping away the outer strongholds of Chiang Kai-shek bandits north of Nantong city, and recovered six places including Xialimiao. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Nantong city were panicked, and urgently adjusted a part of the 21st Division to reinforce and counterattack, reoccupying the area. This victory crushed the enemy's counterattack conspiracy.
　　Xinhua News Agency, East China, 21st. Yeting (Yancheng), northern Jiangsu, which was re-captured by the People's Liberation Army in early October, under the leadership of the democratic municipal government, has completed the popular election of all street chiefs and deputy street chiefs in 42 streets. More than 2,200 merchants and citizens who fled abroad during the Chiang Kai-shek occupation have returned one after another. Relief and various construction works are underway, and the market is becoming increasingly prosperous.
