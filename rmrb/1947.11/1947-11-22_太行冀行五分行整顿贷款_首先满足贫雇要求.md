　　Taihang Jiji Fifth Sub-branch Rectifies Loans
  　Prioritizing Poor and Hired Peasants
    [This newspaper's Taihang dispatch, 20th] The Fifth Sub-branch of the Jiji Bank of Southern Hebei in the Taihang District, recently instructed its subordinate county branches to rectify loans and vigorously support the winter production of liberated peasants. The instruction stated first: In the past, due to unclear objectives and class lines regarding production loans, the result was a lack of focus in lending and failure to prioritize the needs of poor and hired peasants, greatly reducing the effectiveness of the loans. For example, in Naozi Village, Ci County, 180,000 yuan was loaned out in the first phase this year, with strong emphasis on using the loans to buy livestock for transportation. The vast majority of these loans went to middle peasants who already owned livestock and carts, while poor and hired peasants who wanted to buy other production tools were unable to obtain loans because their intended use did not meet the transportation requirement. This winter, all counties must thoroughly rectify past loans, implement the principle of focusing on key areas and adhering to the class line. The methods are: 1. Based on the severity of disasters in each area, make targeted adjustments to loans. Through the mass line, clear up due and overdue loans, and use the recovered due and overdue payments, as well as unreleased funds, for reallocation. During the re-lending process, a general inspection of old loans should be conducted, and any deviations from the class line should be immediately corrected. 2. In areas with cooperatives, all lending should be done through cooperatives, or by selecting better small-scale cooperatives and helping them expand and establish credit services on the existing foundation. The instruction continued: Credit cooperatives have already developed significantly in the past six months, and all localities should vigorously and comprehensively develop rural credit services. New areas should also begin to establish them. Existing credit cooperatives (departments) should be assisted in summarizing the work of the past six months to improve their performance. We must boldly and unreservedly support the development of credit services. Any fear that the masses cannot manage the loans or distrust of the masses is incorrect. We must truly achieve lending and repayment on demand, with funds remaining in the village, so that they can play a powerful role in production and overcoming hardship.
    [This newspaper's She County dispatch] She County is conducting an inspection of the 50 million yuan in old and new loans issued in the past, in order to promote large-scale winter production. For example, during this inspection in the seventh district, it was universally discovered that loans were not flexible. Some villages urgently needed loans, but they were not issued until the designated time, while other villages did not need them but received many loans, resulting in waste. Regarding cooperative leadership, it was found that the purpose of loans was unclear. For example, the cooperative in Taicang Village withheld more than 800,000 yuan of a 1 million yuan loan, failing to effectively support the masses or integrate with production. An especially serious problem was also discovered: a lack of clarity in the class line. For example, in the latter phase of lending in Taicang, landlords and rich peasants received loans and used them to buy lime and paper mulberry bark. In Shitai Village, out of 160,000 yuan in loans, four landlord households received 40,000 yuan. In Junkou, out of 550,000 yuan, eight landlord and rich peasant households received 80,000 yuan. Many similar situations exist. After discovering these problems, immediate rectification was carried out, loans were recovered, and re-lending was prioritized to poor and hired peasants, correctly applying the funds to production avenues.

　　太行冀行五分行整顿贷款
  　首先满足贫雇要求
    【本报太行二十日电】冀南银行太行区行第五分行，顷指示所属各县支行，整顿贷款，大力扶持翻身农民冬季生产。指示中首称：过去由于对生产贷款的目的性和阶级路线不明确，因而产生了贷款无重点，没有首先满足了贫雇农民的要求，使贷款作用大大减低。如磁县瑙子村，今年第一期贷款十八万，强调用贷款买牲口运输，绝大部分贷给有牲口有车之中农，贫雇想买其他生产工具，由于用途不适合运输要求，就没贷上。今冬各县必须对过去贷款进行彻底整顿，贯澈重点主义和阶级路线。办法是：一、根据各区灾荒严重程度，将贷款有重点的作一调剂，通过群众路线，清理到期和过期的贷款，以已收回到期、过期款及未放下去的款调剂之。在转贷中，应对旧贷款作一普遍的检查，非阶级路线的应立即纠正。二、在有合作社之地区，一律通过合作社，或选择较好的小型社，在现有基础上，帮助扩大建立信用业务。继称：信用合作社半年来已有很大发展，各地应大力全面的开展农村信用业务，新区也应着手创办。对旧信用社（部）应帮助其总结前半年工作，使之提高一步。要大胆放手的扶植信用业务的开展，一切惧怕群众对贷款掌握不住，对群众不相信的思想，都是不对的。要真正作到随收随放，款不离村，使之在生产渡荒中发挥有力作用。
    【本报涉县讯】涉县为开展冬季大生产，将过去发放的新旧五千万元贷款，进行了检查。如七区在这次检查中，全区普遍发现贷款不灵活，如有的村庄急需贷款，但不到时间不发放，有的村基本上用不着，却贷款很多，结果形成浪费。在合作社领导上，检查出贷款用途不明，如太仓村一百万元的贷款，合作社即扣留了八十余万元，没有正确扶助群众，没有很好和生产结合。又检查出特别严重的问题，是阶级路线不明确。如太仓在后一段贷款五十万元中，地主富农贷上，买了石灰和楮条。史邰村贷款十六万元，地主四户即贷款四万元。峻口五十五万元，地主富农八户即贷了八万元。类似这些情况的很多。在发现这些问题后，便及时进行了整顿，收回贷款，重行转放给贫雇，正确运用到生产门路中去。（贾林、徐元存）
