Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 30th - From the countryside to the cities, from the old liberated areas to the newly liberated areas, the broad masses of peasants who have overturned their lives are launching enthusiastic movements to support the front lines in various ways such as joining the army, participating in the war, and comforting the troops. In the past ten days, vast numbers of peasants who have turned their lives around have actively poured into the main forces. In the Jireliao area of Hebei and Chahar provinces alone, more than 5,000 young adults have voluntarily joined the army. Counties, districts, and villages have simultaneously formed home-guarding and counter-attack platoons, companies, and battalions. At a conscription rally in the Fifth District of Linxi, 175 people collectively signed up and immediately formed a "cavalry company" led by militiaman Li Mingcheng to go to the front. In the Heihechuan area, which was long occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit forces, 500 people rushed to the front lines within five days of the land reform. The movement of peasants who have turned their lives around to participate in the war is extraordinarily enthusiastic in various places. In Gaolimu Village in the new district of Xifeng, a counter-attack brigade of more than 900 peasants who have turned their lives around, upon receiving a war service notice, rushed to the front lines with stretchers they had prepared in advance within three hours. In the newly established Shen Tie Fu County (newly established county) near the heart of the Chiang bandit area, stretcher teams were also organized to accompany the army, and a reserve team was formed to await assignments. Huai De County completed 320 stretchers and 200 large carts in one day. The standing stretcher teams and cart teams organized by various counties in Liaobei Province are ready to depart at any time. In Yanji, in one week, more than 1,600 civilian laborers and more than 2,600 short-distance stretcher teams poured into the front lines. In addition, teams for civil engineering, doctors, and transportation were established to serve the front, and the rear organized second, third, and fourth batches of reserve stretcher teams, with more than 4,200 people eager to participate in the war and make contributions. The 3,000-person war participation contingent organized by peasants in Nenjiang has successively set off. The contingent is large and well-equipped, with 400 stretchers, 1,000 strong horses, and 300 large carts. The members carry ample air defense supplies and are equipped with veterinarians. Medical clinics, discipline inspection groups, and merit evaluation committees have been established to prepare for a longer period of service in the war zone. Nearly 500 stretcher bearers in Zhaodong County underwent seven days of training after gathering. Each squadron challenged and competed with each other, and poor and hired peasants automatically established "determination associations" and made vows. The wooden poles of the stretchers were painted in red with regulations drawn up by the masses themselves, such as: "Lift slowly, lower gently, carry steadily, and arrange food and warmth for him first," "Don't run around when you encounter a plane, put the wounded first, and then lie down yourself," and "The army and the people are of one heart, and can lift a thousand pounds with great strength. Follow Chief Lin and wipe out Chiang Kai-shek's army." When the stretcher teams departed from various places, the masses enthusiastically bid them farewell, giving them fur coats, cotton clothes, and fur hats, presenting a great and moving scene of peasants who have turned their lives around enthusiastically supporting the front. The movement to comfort the troops in the rear is also in full swing. Since the army advanced into Beining Road, Xingcheng and Suizhong counties in western Liaoning, in addition to dispatching more than 10,000 civilian laborers and 1,600 stretchers, women from all over the area have mobilized to care for wounded soldiers passing by, and cook porridge, eggs and other foods to offer kind condolences. In half a month, peasants who have turned their lives around in Suizhong have comforted the People's Liberation Army with 23 pigs, 147 sheep, more than 8,000 eggs, 8,500 catties of apples, and 10,000 catties of dates. The women of Lamadong Village in Lingnan County, Rehe Province, enthusiastically discussed the work of comforting the troops, and every family let their beds, pasted windows, and prepared food to entertain the soldiers coming and going. Sewing and washing groups were established to sew and wash clothes, shoes, and socks for the counter-attacking soldiers. When wounded soldiers arrived, every household opened their doors, lit red lanterns, and heated the beds to receive the wounded. The "One Pair of Shoes" movement initiated by the Women's Federation in Baodi County, Jidong, has completed 8,500 pairs, while Yutian County donated more than 12,000 pairs in 20 days. In Zhongping District, Yanji City, Jilin, ten women organized themselves to collectively make counter-attack shoes. Worker Xi Zhimin from Dunbei County made a pair of shoes with a total of 16,800 stitches, guaranteeing that soldiers could wear them for a year. According to incomplete statistics, the amount of donations for comforting the troops in 20 counties including Wuchang, Yanshou, Keshan, and Wangqing has exceeded 100 million yuan (equivalent to 1 billion yuan of Chiang's currency). Comfort groups have been widely organized in various places and have set off to the front lines. A working group organized by workers and shop assistants in Harbin City has set off with a portion of comfort items, and a film comfort team is traveling with them.
