(Our newspaper's telegraph from Ji Lu Yu on the 3rd) After the masses in Yuncheng understood the counter-offensive situation, under slogans such as "Plant wheat this year, and you'll be guaranteed to eat next year." (Guaranteed that you will eat what you grow, and the army will too, unlike this year when the enemy eats it). "Planting one more mu of wheat adds one more point of strength to the counter-offensive," all villages planted much more wheat than last year. The area sown to wheat was generally expanded by one-third. As of the Frost's Descent solar term, according to statistics from the Fourth, Sixth, and Eighth Districts: a total of 2,150 qing of land were planted; last year, 1,020 qing were planted, and this year, 1,400 qing were planted, an increase of 380 qing. Since the county party committee issued a call on October 5th for a ten-day blitz to plant wheat and launch a propaganda campaign about the situation, cadres in each district have gone deep into the villages to understand the demands and thoughts of the masses, and then universally launched a propaganda offensive to mobilize the masses to plant more and plant quickly. Since then, a wheat-planting upsurge has rapidly formed throughout the county. The Fourth District suffered the most damage from the enemy, and the masses' production enthusiasm was greatly affected. The "change of regime" concerns were greater, fearing that they would not be able to eat what they planted. Many middle peasants wanted to sell their livestock, but since the propaganda situation was closely integrated with wheat-planting propaganda, the masses' confidence in victory was doubled, and their production enthusiasm was greatly increased. Danhai Village bought six head of cattle in one day. Shaoji organized all the manpower and animal power of the village to complete the wheat planting for more than eighty households of military dependents and poor peasants in one day. The Third and Fourth Districts of the county are cotton-producing areas, and rarely grow wheat every year. In the past, at most, 30 percent was planted, but this year, even the smallest villages planted 50 percent. Under the slogan of planting more and planting quickly, many heroic models have emerged. For example, Ma Liantian, a poor peasant from Mazhuang in the Sixth District, is an old man of seventy-three this year. In the past, he had eight mu of land, and he was allocated another six mu in the land reform. He often couldn't sleep happily. Since the higher authorities proposed the call to plant more wheat, Ma Liantian dug the land day and night. In less than ten days, he dug seven mu and planted all of it with wheat, and put all five large carts of manure he usually picked up on the wheat field. In wheat planting, mutual assistance between middle and poor peasants was also universally implemented, solving the serious difficulties of lack of manpower and animal power: in Wangying and Liuhai in the Fifth District, Shaoji in the Fourth District, Chenpo and other villages in the Eighth District, poor peasants actively and enthusiastically helped middle peasants with plowing and rolling. Exchanging manpower for animal power, neither side suffered losses, and many middle peasants voluntarily plowed the land for military, worker, and martyr dependents. A middle peasant from Qian Liuhai said: "People are shedding blood and fighting and working for us outside, so it is right and proper for us to help them plant wheat." Therefore, in this blitz to plant wheat, not only was the plan quickly completed, but also the unity of the middle and poor peasants was increased.

    深入宣传反攻，群众摸清了底
    郓城四、六、八区
    扩大麦田三万余亩
    【本报冀鲁豫三日电】郓城群众在认清了反攻形势以后，在“今年种上麦，明年保准吃。”（保准自己种自己队伍吃，不会象今年叫敌人吃去）。“多种一亩麦，多一分反攻力量”等口号下，各村都较去年多种了很多麦子，种麦面积普遍扩大三分之一，截至霜降为止，据四、六、八三个区的统计：共地二千一百五十顷，去年种麦一千零廿顷，今年种麦一千四百顷，增加三百八十顷。自十月五日县委提出十天突击种麦及展开宣传形势的号召后，各区干部即深入到村，了解群众的要求及群众的思想情况后，便普遍展开宣传攻势，发动群众多种、快种，自此，全县迅速形成种麦热潮。四区受敌摧残最重，群众生产情绪很受影响，“变天”顾虑较大，怕种上吃不上，很多中农要卖掉牲口，但自宣传形势，紧紧结合种麦宣传以后，群众胜利信心倍加，生产热情也大大提高，单海村在一天之内买牛六头。邵集组织全村人力畜力，一天种完八十多户军工属和贫农的麦子。该县三、四区，本是产棉区，年年很少种麦，往年顶多种到百分之卅，今年顶小村庄也种到百分之五十。在多种、快种的口号下，出现了许多英雄模范，如六区马庄贫农马连田，今年已是七十三岁的老汉，过去有八亩地土改中又分了六亩地，他常高兴的睡不着觉，自上级提出多种麦的号召后，马连田日以继夜的掘地，不到十天，掘了七亩全种上麦子，并把平日拾得的五大车粪，全都上到麦地里。种麦中，并普遍实行了中贫农互助，解决了人力畜力缺乏的严重困难：五区王营、刘海，四区邵集，八区陈坡等村，贫农积极而热情的给中农帮耧、砘地。以人力换畜力，互不吃亏，而许多中农自愿的给军、工、烈属犁地，前刘海中农说：“人家在外拼命流血，为咱打仗、工作，咱帮忙种种麦子是理应当的，是分内事。”所以，在这次突击种麦中，不但很快的完成了计划，且增加了中贫农的团结。
