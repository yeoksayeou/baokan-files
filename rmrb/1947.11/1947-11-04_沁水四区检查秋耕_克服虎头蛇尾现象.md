Qinshui Fourth District Inspects Autumn Plowing
Overcoming the "Starting Strong, Finishing Weak" Phenomenon
[This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch dated 2nd] The Qinshui Fourth District inspected autumn plowing and discovered that due to cadres not valuing this work and lacking good organization and planning, a "starting strong, finishing weak" situation had developed. In order to overcome this serious problem, the district convened an expanded cadre meeting on October 23rd, which identified the following reasons: (1) The fatigue of cadres and the masses, who felt that there was little labor and large tasks, making it impossible to complete. (2) Cadres and the masses prioritizing sideline occupations over agriculture, focusing only on immediate gains and neglecting the long-term, with many masses neglecting plowing to engage in transportation. (3) Some believed that after the autumn harvest, everything was done, and it was time to rest for a few days. After reviewing these shortcomings, everyone once again recognized the importance of autumn plowing, which can kill insects, conserve water, and prevent drought. "Autumn plowing is better than manure," increasing grain production. Autumn plowing is not just a production issue, but also related to the military supply for the Great Counteroffensive. After recognizing this, cadres eagerly set out their own meritorious service plans, determined to achieve success in autumn plowing. Liu Jinrong, the labor hero of Dongjiashan, proposed to ensure the following in the autumn plowing: First, all men, women, young and old, full and part-time laborers in the village will be involved in the autumn plowing front, with appropriate division of labor based on physical strength and skills. Old men plow the land, while women and children clean up odds and ends. Second, large-scale mutual aid between neighborhoods will be implemented based on the amount of labor and livestock available for autumn land, solving the difficulty of insufficient labor and livestock. Third, the autumn land of military personnel, cadres, martyrs' families, honored soldiers, and households with members on expeditions will be universally plowed. Fourth, leading cadres and activists will take the lead. Fifth, all autumn land in our village will be completely plowed before November 15th, without leaving a single piece, and inspections will be carried out from household to household. Under this impetus, village cadres one after another drew up plans for meritorious service, guaranteeing that all plowing would be completed before November 15th. A heated autumn plowing campaign is now underway throughout the district.
[This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch dated 2nd] In order to fully launch the autumn plowing campaign, Yangcheng has promulgated reward measures for autumn plowed land: (1) District and village cadres who overcome the masses' underestimation of autumn plowing through persuasion during the autumn plowing campaign, mobilizing the masses and completing the village's autumn plowing work, will be commended and awarded. (2) District and village cadres who personally lead the masses to take action, appropriately organize mutual aid between people and livestock, and complete the village's autumn plowing work will be awarded titles such as "Autumn Plowing Model Heroes." (3) Leaders of mutual aid groups for men and women and labor heroes who can actively overcome the masses' underestimation of autumn plowing during the autumn plowing campaign, organize mutual aid between people and livestock, and protect livestock to complete the plowing of the entire group or village land will be given a silver "Autumn Plowing Model Merit" medal in addition to a public commendation. (4) Full and part-time laborers in mutual aid groups for men and women who can play an active leading role and motivate others to plow land will be given material rewards. (5) Livestock-raising households (especially those with mules, donkeys, and horses) who can guarantee that they will not engage in transportation during the plowing period, complete the plowing of their own land, and also help others plow well and plow more under conditions of equal exchange, and who have made significant achievements, will be commended and materially rewarded.

    克服虎头蛇尾现象
    【本报太岳二日电】沁水四区检查秋垡，发现由于干部对此工作不重视，没有很好的组织计划，形成虎头蛇尾。该区为了克服此种严重毛病，于十月二十三日召开了各区的扩干会议，检讨出如下几个原因：（一）干部群众的疲劳情绪，认为劳力少任务大，没法去干。（二）干部群众的重副轻农，只看现过现，不看眼不见，不少群众不垡地搞运输。（三）有的认为收秋完毕，百事大吉，休息几天吧。经过检讨找出了这些缺点后，大家又重新认识了秋垡的重要，能杀虫蓄水防旱，秋垡顶上粪，能增加产粮，秋垡不但是生产问题，而且是有关大反攻的军需供给问题。干部在认识后，均争先恐后订出了自己的立功计划，决心秋垡立功。董家山劳动英雄刘锦荣提出，保证在秋垡中，一、将全村男女老少全半劳力都卷入到秋垡战线上去，并按体力技术适当的分工。老汉犁地，妇女儿童收拾零活。二、根据秋地劳畜力的多少，实行闾与闾的大变工，解决劳畜力不足困难。三、保证军、干、烈、荣及远征户的秋地普遍犁过。四、保证干部积极分子带头做起。五、保证我村所有秋地在十一月十五日以前全部犁过，不留一分，还要逐户去检查。在此推动下，接二连三的村干部都订出了立功计划，均保证十一月十五日前全部犁完，现全区已展开热烈的秋垡运动。
    【本报太岳二日电】阳城为全力展开秋垡运动，特颁布秋垡地的奖励办法：一、区、村各系统干部在秋垡运动中打通群众轻视秋垡思想，使群众行动起来，完成全村秋垡工作者，予以记功表扬。二、区、村各系统干部亲自动手带领群众，适当组织人畜变工，完成全村秋垡工作者，予以秋垡模范功臣等奖状。三、男女互助组长劳动英雄在秋垡运动中能积极克服群众轻视秋垡思想，组织人畜变工，作到爱护牲口完成全组或全村垡地者，除通报表扬外，并奖给秋垡模范功劳银色奖章。四、男女互助组员的全半劳力能起积极带头作用，推动别人垡地者，予以物质奖励。五、养牲口户（特别是骡、驴、马）在犁垡期间，能保证自己不去运输，将自己的地垡完，并在等价交换的条件下，还能给别人垡的好，垡的多，有显著成绩者，分别予以表扬及物质奖励。
