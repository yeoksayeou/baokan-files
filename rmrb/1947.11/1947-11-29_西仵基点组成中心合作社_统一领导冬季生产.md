　　West Wu Base Point Forms Central Cooperative
  　Unify Leadership of Winter Production
    [Our Newspaper, Licheng News] The West Wu Base Point in the First District convened a meeting of cadres from six main villages on November 20th to discuss how to strengthen the central cooperative (the cooperative jointly formed by the base point), the future development direction of the cooperative, and leadership of winter production. After discussion and research, it was unanimously agreed that the existing ginning and cotton batting machines, oil presses, flour mills, and grinding mills of the cooperative should be priced and invested in mutual aid teams or groups, turning them into small cooperatives. Groups and small cooperatives would then carry out labor-capital profit sharing. In this way, the cooperative could shed its burdens and extract cooperative personnel to specialize in organizing mass winter production, supporting small cooperatives, and the cooperative could undertake cooperative undertakings that the masses could not. In order to overcome the blindness of winter production and achieve planned organization of transportation, opening of workshops, and finding sales outlets for the entire base point, and to overcome the past phenomenon of "this village has an oil press, that village also wants to open an oil press," where the waist doesn't care about the legs and there is no connection between them, it was decided that the six main villages in the entire base point should jointly form a central cooperative in Zhaodian Town to strengthen the unified leadership of the central cooperative over the village cooperatives and winter production work. At that time, West Wu Village proposed to raise 600,000 yuan in shares to invest in the central cooperative, and Zhao Dian and other five villages also proposed to raise 1.35 million yuan to strengthen the central cooperative. Currently, the six main villages plan to raise a total of 1.95 million yuan in shares. The day after the meeting, they immediately repaired the premises and have already opened a pharmacy. They are now actively opening markets, dye houses, etc., to carry out cooperative production that the masses cannot open. On the 21st, livestock and vehicles from various villages went to Wu'an Yangyi to transport grain in large quantities. In order to organize return trips, the central cooperative specially sent cooperative cadres to Yangyi to find work for the grain transport workers from the six villages.

　　西仵基点组成中心合作社
  　统一领导冬季生产
    【本报黎城讯】一区西仵基点，于十一月二十号召开了六个主村干部会议，讨论如何壮大中心合作社（基点共组成之合作社）和合作社今后发展方向及领导冬季生产等问题。经过讨论研究，一致认为今后应把合作社现有的轧、弹花机器工具，油坊、粉坊、磨坊等，作价入到互助队或组里，变成小型合作社，组与小型合作社再进行劳资分红。这样合作社可放下包袱，抽出合作人员来专门组织群众冬季生产，扶助小型合作，合作社可举办群众不能举办的合作事业。为了克服冬季生产的盲目性，做到全基点有计划的组织运输，开设作坊，找出销路，克服已往这村有个油坊，那村也要开个油坊，腰不管腿互不相连的现象，决定全基点六个主村在赵店镇共同组成一中心合作社加强中心合作社对各村社和冬季生产工作的统一领导。当时即有西仵村提出要集股金六十万元，投资中心合作社，赵店等五村也提出要集股一百三十五万，壮大中心合作社，现六个主村共要集股金一百九十五万。会后第二天即修理地方，已将药铺开设起来，现正积极的开设集市染坊等，举办群众所不能开设的合作生产。二十一号各村牲口车辆往武安阳邑大运粮，中心合作社为了组织捎回脚，特派合作干部亲往阳邑给六村运粮民工揽脚。（任卿、隆祥、逢辰）
