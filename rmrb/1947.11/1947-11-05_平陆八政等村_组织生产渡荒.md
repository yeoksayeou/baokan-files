    [This dispatch from Taiyue, 2nd of the month] The five villages of Bazheng, Dakuan, Nancun, Jiandong, and Zhongcun in Pinglu County, which were recently liberated, had most of their grain looted by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits before liberation. This summer's wheat harvest was only 50%, and the autumn crops were also poor. For example, in Huaixia Village, which belongs to Zhongcun, out of a total of 59 households with 210 people, 21 households had nothing to eat in September, and 45 households had nothing to eat in October. At the time of autumn planting, the farmers' association managed to find nine shi of wheat, solving the seed shortage. Therefore, when discussing ways to overcome the famine, everyone said, "Our troops are in a major counter-offensive, and the rear is conserving resources to support the front. How can we ask the government for food? We should organize ourselves well, conserve resources, and engage in production to overcome the famine." Therefore, it was decided that each person would collect leaves from hemp, cotton, rapeseed, goat horn vegetables, persimmons, sweet potatoes, and domestic hemp, and dry them as vegetables to provide food for one and a half months. Women also voluntarily organized to spin yarn and make shoes, and men carried salt, engaging in various sideline productions to supplement the food shortage. Little Quan's mother said, "This winter, I will make a living with my cotton-fluffing bow."

    [This dispatch from Taiyue, 2nd of the month] On October 22nd, the Qinshui First District convened a meeting of cadres from various base areas, calling for the implementation of conservation and famine preparedness. All villages and households should actively accumulate vegetables during threshing to prepare for the spring famine and to compensate for the grain shortage, ensuring that not a single grain of already harvested food is lost. In addition, each household should pickle at least one jar of vegetables, ensuring that not a single piece of cabbage leaf or radish leaf is wasted. The Yuchang Brigade of Wangjiayuan Village was the first to respond, with each household pickling one jar of vegetables and each woman pickling one urn. Although the enemies destroyed all the urns in Chengguan Town, they chopped up and dried the vegetable leaves for storage to replace the use of jars for pickling vegetables.

    平陆八政等村
    组织生产渡荒
    【本报太岳二日电】解放不久的平陆八政、大宽、南村、涧东、中村五村，在解放前大部粮食被蒋匪已抢光了，今夏麦子只有五成收，秋季庄稼又不好。如中村之槐下庄，共五十九户二百一十口人，九月没吃的即有二十一户，十月即有四十五户。秋种时还是农会想法弄了九石麦子，解决了种子困难。因此大家讨论渡荒办法时都说：“咱们队伍正在大反攻，后方正在节约支援前线，咱们怎能向政府要吃呢，还是好好组织起来节约生产渡荒。”因此决定每人采大麻、棉花、油菜、羊角、柿子、红薯、家麻等叶子，晒干菜，以作一个半月食粮。妇女又自动结合纺织做鞋，男人担盐，进行各种副业生产，以补充缺粮。小全妈说：“今冬我就凭我那弹花弦过日子。”
    【本报太岳二日电】沁源一区于十月二十二日召开各基点区干部会议，号召贯澈节约备荒，各村各户在打场时应积极积菜，准备春荒，以补粮食不足，不使既成粮食丢掉一颗。另外每家要按一缸菜不让一片白菜叶与萝卜叶丢掉。王家园玉昌大队首先响应除每家按菜一缸外，每个妇女还要按一瓮，城关镇虽因敌人把瓮子都打烂了，他们就把菜叶切碎晒干屯集起来，以代替用缸按菜。
