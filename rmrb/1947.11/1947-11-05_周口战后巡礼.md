    A Post-Battle Tour of Zhoukou
    Zhang Xiaofu

    At 5:00 AM on October 23rd, two hours after the People's Liberation Army liberated Zhoujiakou, this reporter toured the urban and suburban areas, which stretched about five li in all directions. The sound of artillery fire that annihilated the enemy's cavalry brigade was still ringing in my ears, but the citizens had already opened their doors and stood in the streets, vying to watch the PLA soldiers solemnly march through the center of the city. Children chased and played in the streets. An old man drinking tea at the Gongle Teahouse pointed at the PLA soldiers and said:
    “Look how spirited this army is, truly strong and powerful."

    The Dayang Bridge over the river between the North and South Villages was bustling with traffic, with people coming and going like shuttles. Dozens of merchant ships had lowered their sails, and wisps of smoke rose from the cabins. Countless people gathered at the head of the bridge, sweating as they dismantled the bunkers that the Chiang bandits relied on to struggle. A young man, pointing to the gun emplacement he was dismantling, said:
    "The PLA soldiers hit so accurately that the bricks were shattered.”

    Prisoners were being escorted down Zhongshan Avenue, and the streets were packed with onlookers. Even young women and girls stood on the stone steps to watch. A shop assistant from the Zhoubin Restaurant, pointing to Luo Pinxian, the commander of the Chiang bandit's Third Peace Preservation Regiment, who was covered in mud and hanging his head low in the prisoner group, said with resentment:
    “None of that gang escaped. Look at his pathetic state, he doesn't dare act tough anymore."

    As soon as the PLA's proclamations were posted, citizens flocked to read them. A small businessman from Zhengzhou said to a local resident:
    “Read it out loud, so we can all hear and tell others about it."

    At the Qinglangge Bathhouse, a large red advertisement was posted at the entrance, reading "Welcome PLA Comrades to Take a Bath." The owner, Chen, said excitedly: "The PLA is a lucky star. Zhoukou was first liberated on March 3rd, the second time on June 6th, and this time it entered the city on September 9th. We ordinary people are truly blessed."

    The winter grain markets on West Gate Street, the center of the grain industry, had all opened, but because of the Chiang bandit's extortion, they were not as prosperous as before. Zhen Shishi from the Maoshenghua Grain Mill told the reporter: "Before the July 7th Incident, there were over a hundred businesses in the same industry here. Big merchants from Beijing, Shanghai, Zhengzhou, and Wuhan all came here. The entrance was bustling every day, even throughout the night. Now business has plummeted. Only twenty or thirty grain stores remain. The authorities (referring to the Chiang bandits) don't allow villagers to enter the city. We have to go outside the city to collect the grain and then deliver it to customers after selling it. Added to this are all kinds of exorbitant taxes and levies. It's difficult to even keep the business afloat with such hard work. My mill used to have over thirty employees, but now there are only seven."

    The slogan "Drug addicts will be executed" was plastered everywhere on the walls, but opium smokers were everywhere. An old man said it well: "What ban on smoking and drugs is just a way to make a fortune."

    周口战后巡礼
    张笑付
    十月二十三日五时，人民解放军解放周家口战后两小时，记者巡行纵横各约五华里的市区城郊，歼灭援兵骑一旅的炮声犹震耳欲聋，而市民已洞开门户，拥立街头，争看解放军庄严的从街心驰过，儿童们在街头追遂嬉戏，公乐茶园一位吃茶的老者指着解放军道：
    “看这队伍多有精神，真是兵强马壮”。
    南北寨之间河上的大洋桥，车水马龙行人来往如梭，数十只商船都落下了篷，船舱里冒出缕缕炊烟、桥头上围拢着无数人群，正在挥汗拆除蒋匪赖以挣扎的碉堡，一个青年指着他拆卸的枪眼说：
    解放军打得这么准，砖头都粉碎了。
    中山大街上正在过俘虏，万人空巷，尾随观看，连青年妇女小姑娘们也站到石阶上了望。周滨饭店的小伙计指着俘虏群中一个浑身泥水，低垂着头的蒋匪保三团团长罗品铣愤恨的说：
    “一伙子都没跑掉，你看那个熊样，不敢再使威风了吧。”
    解放军的布告刚一贴出，市民马上蜂拥围观。一位郑州籍的小商人，对一位本地市民说：
    “你大声念念，咱听了，也好给别人说说。”
    清朗阁浴池，门口贴着“欢迎解放军同志洗澡”的大红广告，陈老板兴高彩烈的说：“解放军是福星，周口第一次解放是三月三，二次解放是六月六，这次进城又恰是九月九，真是咱们老百姓有福”。
    粮食业集中地的西门大街冬粮场均已开市，惟因蒋匪勒索，已不如以前兴盛。茂盛华粮坊赈师告记者：“七七事变前，这里同业百余家，京、沪、郑、汉大客商都到这里来，每日门口若市，甚或通宵不息，现在生意是一落千丈了，粮行仅存二、卅家，官上（指蒋匪）不准乡下老百姓进城，都是我们到城外去接粮食，卖了再给客人送。外加种种苛杂，这样艰苦周转，尚难支持门面，本坊原有伙计三十多人，现只七人。
    街墙上到处有“吸烟毒者处死刑”的标语，烟客者，却比比皆是，一位老大爷说得好：“什么禁烟禁毒，不过是借此发一笔横财而已”。
