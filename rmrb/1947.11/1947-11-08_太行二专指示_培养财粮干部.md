Taihang Second Administrative Region Directive
Cultivate Finance and Grain Cadres
[This newspaper's Taihang dispatch from the 4th] The Taihang Second Administrative Region Office instructed all counties to cultivate financial cadres and promote emancipated peasants to participate in financial work, so as to further improve financial work. Recently, after the three checks and rectification of finances in financial departments at all levels, some bad elements were purged, and the cadres' ideology was transformed, greatly enhancing their class consciousness. This is a new achievement in the work; at the same time, it also brings about the difficulty of a shortage of cadres. This requires us to cultivate and promote a large number of new cadres to participate in this work, so as to further allow emancipated peasants to grasp financial power. For example, Pingding and Zuoquan counties have specifically opened accounting training classes, absorbing poor intellectuals or emancipated peasants who are literate, and providing them with short-term training. Yushe also plans to open one.

    太行二专指示
    培养财粮干部
    【本报太行四日电】太行二专署指示各县培养财政干部，提拔翻身农民参加财政工作，使财政工作提高一步。最近各级财政部门，经过三查与整财，清洗了一些坏分子，改造了干部思想，阶级觉悟大为提高，这是工作上新的成绩；同时也带来干部缺乏的困难，这就要求我们大量培养与提拔一批新的干部参加这一工作，以便进一步让翻身农民掌握财经大权。如平定、左权等县专门开办了会计训练班，吸收贫苦知识分子，或粗通文字的翻身农民，加以短期训练，榆社也计划开设。
