Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th. Moscow dispatch: The Soviet Armed Forces Department issued Order No. 87 on the 7th, which stated in brief: Soldiers of the Army and Navy! Comrade Petty Officers! Comrades Officers, Army and Navy Generals! Today, the Soviet people and their armed forces are celebrating the 30th anniversary of the Great October Revolution. Thirty years ago, the Soviet working masses, under the leadership of the Party of Lenin and Stalin, overthrew the rule of capitalists and landlords and established the world's first Soviet socialist state. The Great October Socialist Revolution opened a new century not only in our country's history but also in the history of all mankind. In a short period of history, the Soviet Union realized national industrialization and agricultural collectivization, and established an unprecedented socialist society. The Soviet Union has become a powerful socialist country, a fortress of world civilization and progress. In the Great Patriotic War against Hitler's Germany, the Soviet people and army, under the brilliant leadership of Comrade Stalin, not only defended the freedom and independence of the motherland, but also completely drove out the German fascist army and won an unprecedented victory. The great strength and advantages of the Soviet society and state system, which were so vividly demonstrated in the war, are now equally vividly manifested in the period of peaceful construction. In the two years after the war, the Soviet people have achieved great victories on the front of peaceful labor. The various nationalities of the Soviet Union are celebrating the 30th anniversary of the Great October Revolution in an unprecedented political and production upsurge. The Second World War caused serious failures to the capitalist world. The main reactionary forces in the international arena—fascist Germany and imperialist Japan—have been shattered. The Soviet Union, which played a major role in defeating fascism, its significance and prestige in the world have increased immeasurably. New people's democratic countries have been born from the flames of the anti-fascist struggle. The forces of socialism and democracy have become stronger, and the forces of capitalism have become weaker. New war instigators are trying to unite the reactionary forces of the world that have been devastated by the war, strengthen the position of capitalism, launch new wars, and destroy socialism and democracy. But the new war instigators should recall the shameful end of their predecessors—Germany—they are examples of playing with fire and burning themselves. The Soviet Union is fighting for the peace and security of all countries, fighting to expose new war instigators. The Soviet Union's peace-loving policy has won the support of new democratic countries and the broad masses of people around the world. The Soviet army is commemorating the 30th anniversary of the Great October Revolution with new achievements in combat and political training. The task of the Soviet army is to vigilantly defend the peace won by our people and the people's construction labor, reliably guarantee the national interests of the Soviet Union, consolidate our country's borders, and become an indestructible frontier for the enemy. In order to properly complete these tasks, our army must always be in a state of combat readiness. All Soviet soldiers must remember Stalin's instruction: In military affairs, we must never stand still. We must constantly improve the quality of combat and political training and enhance the strength of the Soviet army. Officers, generals, and naval admirals have the obligation to study and apply the creative combat experience of the Great Patriotic War every day, and to seek deeper progress in military art; enrich their military and political knowledge, and improve the training and education of troops. The victories our people have achieved in the thirty years of Soviet power are great and glorious. These victories have been achieved thanks to the heroic struggle and selfless labor of the Soviet people under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party. Under the leadership of the Party and the great Stalin, the Soviet people are confidently following the path of Lenin toward the communist victory of our country!

    苏联武装部发布命令
    努力提高战斗政治训练
    时刻警惕保卫民主和平
    【新华社陕北八日电】莫斯科讯：苏联武装队部七日发布第八十七号命令略称：陆海军战士们！士官同志们！军官、陆海军将领同志们！苏联人民及其武装队部，今日庆祝伟大的苏联十月革命三十周年纪念。卅年前，苏联的工人大众在列宁和斯大林党的领导下，推翻了资本家和地主的政权，建立了世界第一个苏维埃社会主义国家。伟大的十月社会主义革命，不仅在我国历史上，而且在全人类历史上开辟了新世纪。在短短的一段历史中，苏联就实现了全国工业化和农业集体化，建立了空前未有的社会主义社会。苏联已成为一个强大有力的社会主义国家，是世界文明和进步的堡垒。在伟大的反对希特勒德国的爱国自卫战争中，苏联人民和军队，在斯大林同志光辉的领导下，不仅坚持了祖国的自由与独立，而且完全逐出了德国法西斯军队，赢得了史无先例的胜利。在战争中所如此生动的证明了的苏维埃社会、国家制度的伟大力量与优点，现在又同样生动地在和平建设时期中表现出来。战后两年中，苏联人民在和平劳动战线上，又取得了重大胜利。苏联各民族是在空前未有的政治与生产的高潮中庆祝伟大十月革命三十周年。二次世界大战，使资本主义世界遭到严重的失败，国际上的主要反动力量——法西斯德国与帝国主义日本——已被粉碎。在击溃法西斯主义中，起了主要作用的苏联，它的意义与在世界上的威信已无量的增加，新的人民的民主国家已经从反法西斯斗争的烽火中诞生。社会主义与民主的力量已更为强大，资本主义的力量已更为衰弱。新战争挑拨者正力图纠合为战争所破坏的世界反动力量，加强资本主义的地位，发动新战争与摧毁社会主义与民主。但新战争挑拨者应当回想他们的先驱者——德国——的可耻下场，他们就是玩火自焚的榜样。苏联正为各国和平安全而战斗，为揭露新战争挑拨者而战斗。苏联爱好和平的政策，获得新民主主义国家如全世界广大人民群众的支持。苏联军队是以战斗和政治训练的新成绩，来纪念伟大十月革命卅周年的。苏联军队的任务就是：警惕的保卫我们人民赢得的和平和人民的建设劳动，可靠的保证苏联的国家利益，巩固我们国家的边疆，成为敌人不可摧毁的边疆。为了适当的完成这些任务，我们军队必须经常处于战斗的准备状态。全体苏联士兵必须牢记斯大林这个训示：在军事上决不可固步自封，必须不断提高战斗与政治训练的素质，提高苏联军队的力量。军官们、将军们和海军将领们，有义务天天研究与应用伟大爱国战争的创造性的战斗经验，并且要求得军事艺术的更深的进步；丰富他们的军事政治知识，改善部队的训练与教育。我们人民在苏维埃政权三十年内获得的胜利，是伟大而光荣的。这些胜利之所以能够取得，应归功于布尔什维克党领导下的苏联人民的英勇的斗争与无我的劳动，在党与伟大斯大林光辉的领导下，苏联人民满怀信心地沿着列宁的道路，走向我们国家的共产主义的胜利！
