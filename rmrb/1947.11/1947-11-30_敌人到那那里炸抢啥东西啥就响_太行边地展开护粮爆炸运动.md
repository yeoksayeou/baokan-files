　　Wherever the enemy goes, whatever they try to bomb or loot, it explodes!
  　A Landmine Defense Movement is Unfolding in the Taihang Border Region
    [Our Taihang Dispatch, 28th] The use of landmines in the Taihang border region has achieved remarkable results. Since the autumn harvest, along the northern and southern lines of Yuci, Taigu, Qi County, Yuanshi, Huolu, Jingxing, Xiuwu, Jiaozuo, Ye County, Anyang and other bordering counties and cities, under the slogan "Advance into enemy territory, plant landmines and explosives, blockade the enemy, and protect the masses in dividing the autumn harvest and land, securing the autumn harvest and land," the organization of mine-laying teams and mobile explosion groups has been widespread. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 918 landmines have been detonated, killing or wounding 826 enemy "Homecoming Corps" leaders and below, and destroying four machine guns, greatly deterring the enemy's rampant looting. In Yuci, under the slogan "Explode in every village the enemy reaches, explode every time the enemy departs or returns; not a single village without explosions, not a single time without explosions," sporadic explosions have developed into a mass landmine movement. In October alone, the county detonated 213 landmines, killing or wounding 92 enemy "Homecoming Corps" leaders and below, more than twice the number of enemies killed by rifles. In early October, more than 2,000 enemies came to Changning Village to loot grain. Before they even reached the village, they were blown to smithereens by the minefield laid by the villagers' militia, combined with cold shots. The enemy suffered 52 casualties and were routed. The Chiang bandits besieged in Jiaozuo twice set out to loot grain, but both times they fell into our mine network, triggering 66 mines and suffering 61 casualties. On the 2nd of this month, more than 500 Chiang bandits from the 38th Division, with more than 1,000 civilian laborers, divided into four routes to loot grain from more than a dozen villages in our Second District, including Liuzhuang and Hekou. Before they even entered the villages, landmines exploded everywhere, and Chiang bandits were torn to pieces. They failed to loot any grain, but triggered 17 landmines, sending 43 of their dog lives to hell. In Taigu, during the smashing of the enemy's "water submersion" grain grab in October, 33 landmines were detonated in four days, killing or wounding 39 enemies. Flying mine explosions were also carried out, burying landmines at the base of pillboxes, locking down the Yan bandits, and successfully completing the division of the autumn harvest and land. The Fifth District militia armed turn-over team laid a minefield at the enemy stronghold in Rencun, killing or wounding 12 enemies with one mine. The Yuci Zikeng militia buried five large mines at the base of the Guocun blockhouse, and then used cold shots to lure the enemy out. All the landmines exploded, and the enemy, after suffering five casualties, dared not come out again. Masses in the border areas of Yuanshi, Huolu, Jiaozuo, and other places have used landmines as guard dogs. When the enemy comes to loot grain, they attach or bury landmines on doors, in cabinets, under rice jars, on well platforms, at cave entrances, and in all places where the enemy might loot things and on all the roads they must take. On October 1st, enemies from Huolu came to our Nanzhai to loot grain. One bandit went to take a saddle. As soon as he reached out, the mine exploded and his stomach burst open. Another enemy went to move a guillotine and his leg was blown off. Three more went to the well platform to draw water and ended up lying at the base of the well platform. Finally, the bandits went to find mats to wrap the corpses, and two more went back to their old homes. On October 26th, local tyrant Wang Fengying from Jiaozuo went to our Yangjiazhuang to loot grain. He pushed the village chief's door open and was hit by a door-stopping mine. Two Chiang bandits who were grabbing to carry a rice crock were both wounded by the mine. When the enemy reached Beiye Village, they saw two good pear trees and swarmed up the trees to pick pears. Unexpectedly, when a branch was pulled hard, a series of mines went off together, killing or wounding five more. Due to the power of our explosions, the Chiang and Yan bandits have generally suffered from mine phobia. The enemies in Yuanshi were so frightened by the explosions that they designated the south of the city as a mine zone, prohibited passage, and posted wooden signs everywhere saying "Beware of Landmines," and dug ditches three feet wide and deep along the large and small roads to prevent us from burying mines. The enemies in Huolu, who were scared out of their wits by landmines (the city has now been recovered by us, and all the Chiang bandit troops were annihilated at the same time - Editor), would frown and say, "This time we go out we're going to eat black eggs (landmines)!" Whenever they set out. To prevent our landmines, they carried long poles when setting out, probing as they walked. On September 17th, more than 1,000 traitors, bullies, landlords, and Homecoming Corps members in Huolu City went to Liangjiazhuang and Sanzhai to loot grain in three routes. The enemies who went to Liangjiazhuang stepped on six mines on the way and were so frightened that they dared not enter the village, nor dared they rest in the shade of trees. They wandered around for a day and returned to the city. The enemies who went to Sanzhai dared not enter the house after entering the village, probing six mines with poles, so frightened that they were dumbfounded and ran back in a hurry. When our masses were evacuating from Lingdi Village, every house hung a mine on the door, forcing the enemy to put up ladders and drill through the roofs to get into the houses. On September 26th, local tyrant Wang Fengying from Jiaozuo went to Fucheng to loot grain, dared not go through the door, climbed into the courtyard from the wall, and climbed into the house from the window. He pulled open a drawer and saw a landmine rolling back and forth, and dared not touch anything else before running out. Several mine craters on the Xunquanbei Road scared the enemy back to their stronghold. On the same day, more than 1,000 traitors and bullies from Bailong Township went to Donghe to loot grain and return, but dared not walk in front. Special agent Lian Qilu said, "I'll walk in front, I know where there are mines." Before he finished speaking, he was blown to death. When the enemies from Shangzhuang, Taigu went to Wangzhuang and Baiyan to loot grain, they dared not take the main road and took a detour, but unexpectedly there were more landmines on the detour, and three mines were detonated in a row, killing or wounding five enemies. Those who were not killed all scurried back. On September 13th, the Chiang bandits in Anyang City went to Xiqugou to loot grain. As soon as they saw new soil on the road, they wrote "Landmines Here, Beware! Beware!" With the development of the landmine warfare, the explosion technology in various places has been generally improved, and the creations are gradually increasing. In Yuci, under the slogan "Bury dead mines alive, wherever the enemy goes, the landmines explode," all but 105 of the 308 landmines buried in October exploded. The "Mutual Aid Mine" invented by Taihang explosion hero Tian Rongxiao, which explodes when triggered, stepped on, or kicked, is very effective. It detonated seven mines in 15 days, killing or wounding 12 enemies, and has now been promoted throughout the county. The "Move and Explode Mine" and "Explode Without Moving Mine" invented by Taihang explosion expert Hao Xiaoshan killed or wounded 13 enemies in one experiment in the Yuanshi campaign to protect the autumn harvest and divide the land. The advantage of the Move and Explode Mine is that it does not get damp and is not disguised. As long as it is placed on the road, it explodes as soon as the enemy moves it. The "Double-Eyed Mine," created by the militia of Gaomihe Village, Jiaozuo, explodes the hidden mine after the enemy discovers and cuts the line of the exposed mine. Recently, in order to cooperate with the national counter-offensive and further attack the Chiang and Yan bandits' grain-grabbing muzzles and surround the Chiang and Yan bandit troops, a large-scale landmine war is being launched. In Anyang, under the slogan of "Don't let the enemy steal an ounce of coal, an ounce of firewood, or a grain of grain," a competition to explode 100,000 landmines was launched in early November, and all the large and small road entrances and exits for the Chiang bandit troops to go out and loot grain were blocked with landmines. Ye County has trained a group of skilled explosion experts, and the second batch of more than 50 people also graduated on October 31st. Before they left, they launched a challenge, proposing to kill 120 enemies in November. In order to encourage the explosion and killing of enemies, Taigu stipulates that one is rewarded for each explosion and killing, and a meritorious service is recorded once. The leadership calls on cadres to take the lead, connect with the enemy to bury landmines, study enemy activities, turn dead mines into live mines, and combine defense and offense, and illusion and reality, to create a world where the enemy fears landmines. In Yuci, in addition to rewarding one for each explosion, another 200 silver dollars are awarded. At present, the landmine movement in the grain protection war is being universally launched throughout the region.

　　敌人到那那里炸抢啥东西啥就响
  　太行边地展开护粮爆炸运动
    【本报太行二十八日电】太行边地爆炸获得惊人成绩。入秋以来，南北两线之榆次、太谷、祁县、元氏、获鹿、井陉、修武、焦作、邺县、安阳等边沿县市，在“挺进敌后，埋雷爆炸，封锁敌人，掩护群众分秋分田，保秋保田”的口号下，广泛组织爆炸队与飞行爆炸小组。据不完全统计：共炸响地雷九百一十八个，炸死伤敌“还乡队”长以下八百廿六人，炸毁机枪四挺，大大打击了敌人的抢粮凶焰。榆次在“敌到村村炸，敌出发回回炸，没有一村不炸，没有一回不炸”的口号下，已由过去零星爆炸发展成为群众性的爆炸运动。该县十月份一个月即爆炸了地雷二百十三个，炸死伤敌“还乡队”长以下九十二人，超过步枪杀伤敌人总数的两倍。十月初，二千余敌到长凝村抢粮，未到村里即被该村民兵摆好的地雷阵结合冷枪炸了个一塌糊涂，敌死伤五十二人，大败而回。困守焦作蒋匪两次出发抢粮均陷我雷网，踏响雷六十六个，死伤六十一人。本月二日，蒋匪三十八师五百余人，带着千余民夫，分四路到我二区刘庄、河口等十余村抢粮，还未进村，地雷即四处爆炸，蒋匪血肉横飞，粮未抢上，却踏响地雷十七个，送了四十三条狗命。太谷在十月份粉碎敌人“水漫”大抢粮中，四天炸雷三十三个，杀伤敌人三十九人，并开展飞雷爆炸，把地雷埋到碉堡根，紧锁阎匪，胜利完成分秋分田。五区民兵武装翻身队在仁村敌据点摆下地雷阵，一雷炸死伤敌十二个。榆次紫坑民兵将五个大雷埋到郭村炮台根，又用冷枪诱敌出外，地雷全炸，敌死伤五人后再也不敢出来。元氏、获鹿、焦作等边地群众纷纷以雷当作看家狗，敌来抢粮时，即在门上、柜里、米缸下、井台上、窑洞口等所有敌人可能抢得东西和必经的路，都拴上或埋上地雷。十月一日，获鹿敌人到我南寨抢粮，一个匪军去拿鞍子，一伸手，雷炸肚开花；另敌去搬铡刀被炸断了腿，又三个到井台担水，就躺在井台根，最后，匪军去找席子卷死尸，又有两个也回了老家。焦作土顽王凤英十月二十六日到我杨家庄抢粮，一推村长门就吃了一个顶门雷，两个抢着端米瓦缸的蒋匪均被雷炸伤。敌走到北叶村，见两树好梨，蜂涌上树争抢摘梨，不想树枝一紧，连环雷一齐开花，又死伤了五个。由于我之爆炸威力，蒋阎匪普遍害了恐雷病；元氏敌人被炸的提心吊胆，将城南划为雷区，不准通行，到处标插“小心地雷”木牌，并将大小路挖成三尺宽深的沟，防我埋雷。让地雷吓破胆的获鹿敌人（现该城已为我收复，蒋匪军同时全部被歼——编者），每逢出发时就发愁的说：“这回出去又要吃黑鸡蛋（地雷）呀”！为防我地雷，出发时携带长杆，边探边走，九月十七日，获鹿城内奸霸、地主、还乡团千余人，三路向我梁家庄、三寨抢粮，到我梁家庄抢粮之敌，路上踏响六个雷后，吓得不敢进村，也不敢到树荫下休息，来回游转了一天返回城内；到三寨之敌，进了村不敢进家，以杆探响六雷，吓得目瞪口呆，跑步回窜。岭底村我群众在转移时，家家门上挂着雷，敌人被迫架上梯子挖透房顶往家钻。焦作土顽王凤英于九月二十六到付城抢粮，不敢走门，从墙上爬进院，又从窗上爬进屋，拉开抽斗一看，一颗地雷来回滚动，再没敢动别的东西就跑出来。荀泉碑路上几个地雷坑，就把敌人吓回据点。同日，白龙乡奸霸千余人到东河抢粮回返，都不敢走前头，特务连启禄说：“我在前头走，我知道那里有雷”。话未说完即被炸死。太谷上庄敌到我王庄、白燕抢粮，不敢走大路，绕了小路，不料小路地雷更多，一连踏响三个，死伤敌五个，未炸死的全部窜回。九月十三日，安阳城蒋匪到我西曲沟抢粮，路上一见新土即写上“此处有地雷，小心！小心！”随着地雷战的开展，各地爆炸技术普遍提高，创造日渐增多。榆次在“死雷活埋，敌人走到那里，地雷炸到那里”的口号下，十月埋的三百零八个地雷除一百零五个坏了未炸外，全部炸响。太行爆炸英雄田荣小发明的起、踏、踢都响的“互助雷”，效力很大，十五天中爆炸七个，炸死伤敌十二人，现已在全县推广。太行爆炸能手郝小山发明的“一动就响雷”和“不动自响雷”，在元氏保秋分田斗争中试验一次即杀伤敌人十三个。一动就响雷的优点是一不反潮，二不伪装，只要放在路上，敌一动即响。焦作高密河村民兵创造的“明暗两眼雷”敌人发觉后割明雷的线，暗雷跟着爆炸。近来各地为配合全国大反攻，进一步打击蒋、阎匪抢粮猪嘴，围困蒋、阎匪军，正在的大规模的开展地雷战。安阳在“不让敌抢走一斤煤、一斤柴，一粒粮”的口号下，于十一月初开展了十万个地雷爆炸竞赛运动，蒋匪军出外抢粮之大小路口全部埋雷封锁。邺县已训练出一批精干爆炸能手，第二批五十余人也于十月三十一日毕业，他们临行前展开了挑战，提出在十一月内要炸死敌人一百二十名。太谷为鼓励爆炸杀敌，规定炸一个奖一个，并记功一次，领导上号召干部带头，接敌埋雷，研究敌人活动，变死雷为活雷，防守进攻，虚虚实实相互结合，造成敌人恐雷世界。榆次除炸一个奖一个外，另奖洋二百元。现全区护粮战中的爆炸运动正在普遍开展。
