Shi Panghai and Cui Zhangcun's Farming Two, Surplus One
    Yang Qianwei

    Cui Zhangcun in Changzhi is a village extremely short of labor. The village has 2,195 mu of land, but only 56 male full laborers. Each laborer has to farm an average of 39.2 mu of land. This year, participation in the war effort used 2,180 workdays. However, this year's autumn harvest achieved not only farming two and having a surplus one, but even more than that. The attainment of these achievements is inseparable from Shi Panghai's leadership. Therefore, when Shi Panghai is mentioned, the people of Cui Zhangcun all say, "He is truly 'root and branch correct', the poor leading the poor to victory!"

    Panghai is forty years old this year. When he was a child, his father drove a cart for the landlord, and his mother nursed the landlord's child. Unfortunately, his father was crippled by the cart. Leaving the landlord's house, they didn't have a room to live in or a sliver of land. He and his mother lived in a temple, making a living by begging, selling vegetables, selling sesame candy, and collecting manure. At fifteen, he herded sheep, and at sixteen, he wandered around doing odd jobs. He lived in the landlord Shi Haisheng's house in this village for a full twelve years.

    After liberation, he swore in front of the cadres and the masses, saying: "I lived as a servant for the landlord for twelve years, being beaten and scolded, living a life worse than livestock. Now, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, I have been liberated. I will follow Chairman Mao and learn from Chairman Mao. In the past, I served the landlord for twelve years for nothing. Now I have found a place to exert my strength. I tell everyone, I will work even harder for everyone than in the previous twelve years." When working for everyone, he often said: "Chairman Mao told us to 'be both teachers and students of the masses.'" Therefore, whenever something happened, Panghai always asked the masses for solutions, often saying: "We are all one family, we all have to think of solutions, we are all Zhuge Liang." The villagers all admired his democratic style. As soon as they heard Panghai say "We are all...", they all perked up and listened to what new ideas he had! He often precisely and meticulously calculated how much land the village had, how much of what was planted, when should which plot be hoed, how many workdays were needed... No matter what the number, as long as you looked for Panghai, you could find out.

    In the spring, the government called for "farming three, surplus one." After hearing this, Panghai calculated all day: the village relies entirely on farming to feed itself, but simply growing grain doesn't yield much, and it's not enough to get through the year. Panghai went to the masses to find a solution, and found Wang Fusheng, a seventy-three-year-old indigo planting expert (a poor peasant who hadn't farmed for many years) to discuss this matter. After calculation, if indigo was planted, each mu would yield the equivalent of fourteen shi of grain, one mu being equivalent to eleven mu of harvest. However, the village had never grown indigo before. After finding this way out, he promoted it among the masses. At first, everyone was unwilling to plant it. Some said: "Planting indigo is labor-intensive, and our village doesn't have the labor to do it." Others said: "Our village has never planted it before, we don't know how." After Panghai understood this, he calculated the accounts with everyone: "One mu of indigo is better than ten mu of field." At the same time, he found a reliance for everyone, personally mobilizing Wang Fusheng to be in charge of planting indigo in the village, guaranteeing a good harvest. Panghai himself advanced more than 20,000 yuan to buy twenty-five jin of indigo seeds, preparing for everyone to plant, but only two households followed suit. Others still said they didn't know how to plant it. Panghai, seeing that he couldn't rush it, planted forty-six ridges of his own land first, preparing seedlings for everyone, and continuing to mobilize, saying it wouldn't be too late to transplant the seedlings when everyone understood. He said, "We can't be discouraged if people don't understand. As long as they understand, they can do it. If we don't advance the planting, it will be too late to regret it when they understand." Under Panghai's words of explanation, calculation, and finding a reliance, everyone finally understood when it came time to transplant the seedlings. Relying on the seedlings he advanced, the whole village planted forty-five mu of indigo. A few who didn't plant indigo later saw that other people's indigo was growing well, and regretted saying, "We must listen to Panghai in the future, or we will suffer a loss." When hoeing the seedlings, he also led everyone to dig new wells and repair old wells, organizing women to water the indigo eight times. Under Panghai's cultivation, Wang Fusheng also became a young man, getting up early every morning before dawn to walk through all the indigo fields in the village. Old Man Wang would tell people who needed to water or repair their indigo, truly becoming a reliance for the people of the village. When killing the hemp and making indigo dye, Panghai discussed with the technology committee Wang Fusheng to quickly build indigo vats, as delays would reduce the indigo harvest. After discussion and announcement among the masses, they were about to start immediately, but people started arguing again. People in the Small Dog group said: "Panghai's group has Fu Yuan and two others, they are truly like gold, silver, jade, a single-minded group, even going to Tianjin and Beijing, I'm afraid that won't work!" Some said, "Let him do it, we'll do it after he ferments it. If it doesn't work, we'll plow it over and plant something else. We don't have a good planner, how can we build an indigo vat." After Panghai heard this, he immediately transferred his group's model member Shi Fuyuan to the Small Dog group to plan for everyone, which was immediately welcomed, and Fuyuan was elected as the group leader. At that time, full laborers had to be drawn to build the indigo vats and quickly ferment the indigo, but the hemp also had to be killed immediately. The village couldn't handle it all. Panghai discussed it with everyone and organized women and children to kill the hemp. Experienced old men shaved the hemp tips. To encourage the enthusiasm of women and children, the work points earned by the children were valued at 100 yuan per day, to be used by the children to buy books. The women's earnings were split with the family 30/70. Under such planned organization and leadership, seven indigo vats and three settling ponds were quickly built. The hemp was also killed. After calculation, each mu of indigo produced seventy jin, equivalent to fourteen shi of grain, the total of forty-five mu in the village being equivalent to 630 shi of grain, exciting everyone who said: "Organizing can overcome difficulties."

    In March, just when it was time to prepare manure and repair field edges, the people in the village were all sitting around and wandering aimlessly. At that time, the village's manure, calculated at twenty dan per mu, was only enough for 750 mu of land, a large shortage of manure. Seeing that the momentum was not right, Panghai talked to everyone, saying, "Land is fundamental, no manure means no rich roots!" He also carefully calculated the accounts with everyone, giving them the facts: "The Yu Suo family has two people, planting seventeen or eighteen mu of land, but they don't apply manure. The hemp grows one foot high, and the grain harvested is not enough to eat. The Man Sheng family has five people, also planting seventeen or eighteen mu of land, but they apply the most manure. Last year, each mu of barley yielded 3.9 shi, and they couldn't eat all the grain they harvested." These honest words opened everyone's minds. Panghai proposed that the application of manure should follow Man Sheng's example. Under his leadership, the whole village applied twenty-four dan of manure per mu, and the crops grew particularly well.

    When hoeing the seedlings, problems also arose in the mutual aid groups. Some collapsed, and some felt they were suffering losses, afraid of being called backward, and didn't speak up. For example, Ma Wang said: "My hoeing one mu is worth ten points, others hoeing six points is also worth ten points." Shi Shui said: "It's better to do odd jobs, doing work but not getting paid." Hei Hai said: "I hoe one step at a time, neatly and cleanly, worth ten points, they hoe it messily, also worth ten points!" After Panghai discovered this, he discussed it with everyone, and after arguing, they came up with a solution: quickly settle the accounts of each group, stipulate that work points are based on the amount of work done, and issue work points on the spot after inspecting the hoed area. And reorganize the groups to pair up people with similar mindsets, merging nine groups into five groups, and the enthusiasm of each group increased. Shi Fuyuan was in the fourth group at that time, wandering around and not working, and the whole group was dissatisfied with him, not cooperating with him, making him isolated. Fuyuan had no choice but to find Panghai. Panghai agreed to him, patiently telling him, "If you come to my group, you have to listen to my group." After Panghai's two months of patient persuasion, Fuyuan became a top model member. When building the indigo vat, the original group wanted him back and elected him as the group leader.

    In order to hoe, topdress, and harvest more grain together, Panghai led everyone to establish a technology committee, selecting experienced people such as Cheng Heihai and five others to be responsible. Corn and millet were universally hoed three times throughout the village, the Jin Queen variety five times, and two-thirds of the corn and millet were topdressed.

    Under the leadership of Panghai and their production technology committee, the whole village truly achieved "Eight Immortals crossing the sea, each displaying their unique abilities." Making it so that everyone in the village had something to do, and everyone benefited. This autumn, after calculation, Cui Zhangcun's total of 2,195 mu of land (not including the landlords' land) produced 3,804.1 shi of grain, including 162 mu of hemp, each mu yielding the equivalent of 4 shi of grain, totaling 648 shi, 45 mu of indigo, each mu yielding the equivalent of 14 shi of grain, totaling 630 shi, and 58 mu of tobacco, each mu yielding the equivalent of 4 shi of grain, totaling 232 shi. Sideline income was equivalent to 190.9 shi of grain, for a total of 3,995 shi. The whole village of 408 people (not including the landlords' population and income), according to the local situation, each person's annual expenditure is calculated at 6.5 shi of coarse grain (including food, clothing, use, and production investment), totaling 2,652 shi, leaving a surplus of 1,343 shi. Farming two, surplus one, and still having a surplus of 34 shi.

    史胖孩和崔彰村的耕二余一
    杨谦维
    长治崔彰村是一个劳力极缺的村子，全村二千一百九十五亩地。只有男全劳力五十六个，每个劳力平均要种三十九亩二分地，今年参战就用了二千一百八十个工。可是今年秋收下来却达到耕二余一还有余，这些成绩的获得，是和史胖孩的领导分不开的。所以一提史胖孩，崔彰村的人就都说真是“根正梢正，穷人领导穷人胜”！
    胖孩今年四十岁了，小时候爹给地主赶车，娘给地主奶孩，不幸爹被大车碾残废了，离开地主家，房无一间地无一垅，跟娘住在庙里，要饭、卖菜、卖麻糖拾粪迁就着活下去，十五岁上放羊，十六岁就流浪打短工，仅在本村地主史海盛家就整整住主十二年。
    翻身后，他在干部群众跟前发过誓，他说：“我住了十二年主儿，挨打受气，每天过着不如牲口的生活。至今在毛主席领导下我翻身了，我要跟着毛主席走，学习毛主席。过去我白给地主受了十二年，现在我找到了出力地方，我对着大家说哩，我要比前十二年更努力的给大家办事。”在为大家办事的时候，他常说：“毛主席告咱说的‘既要当群众的先生，又要当群众的学生’。”因此有了事，胖孩总是向群众要办法，常好说：“咱都是一家人，咱都要想办法，咱都是诸葛亮”。村上人都佩服他的民主作风，一听胖孩说“咱都是……”，就都鼓起劲，竖起耳朵听他又有什么新办法了！他经常精确细密的计算着全村有多少地，种多少什么，多会该锄那块奶那块，须要多少工……不管什么数字，只要找着胖孩就能问得出来。
    春天里，政府号召“耕三余一”，胖孩听了后，成天计算着：本村全靠养种地糊嘴，可是光地打不多粮食，一年顾不住一年。胖孩就到群众中找办法，找到了七十三岁的种蓝把式王福生老汉（贫农，已多年未种）商量这事，计算一下，若是种蓝每亩收成合十四石粮，一亩能顶十一亩收，只是本村过去从未种过。找到了这个门路后，便在群众中宣传。最初大家都不愿种，有的说：“种小蓝费工，咱村没劳力种不过来”，有的说：“咱村没种过，不会种。胖孩摸到这心思后，就跟大家算帐“一亩小蓝胜过十亩田”，同时给大家找依靠，亲自动员王福生老汉，专管村上种小蓝，保证种好。胖孩自己则垫出两万多块钱，买了二十五斤小蓝籽，准备让大家种，结果却只两户跟着种，别的人还是说不会种。胖孩看着当下赶不来，就把自己的地先种了四十六畦，给大家准备好秧，一面继续动员，等到大家想通了再插秧也不算晚。他说“人们想不通，咱也不能灰心，只要他们想通了就能干起来，要是咱不先垫种上，等他们想通了后悔也来不及了”；在胖孩千言万语的解说，算帐，找依靠下，到插秧时大家才想通了，靠他垫种的秧，全村种了四十五亩小蓝，少数没种上的到以后看别人的小蓝长的好，都后悔的说：“咱以后可得听胖孩的话哩，一时不听就吃亏了”。锄苗时，又领导大家打新井挖旧井，组织妇女把小蓝浇过八水，在胖孩培养下，王福生老汉也变成青年人了，每天清早，天不明就起来，把全村小蓝地都要走遍，谁家小蓝该浇，谁家小蓝有油虫，老汉回来就告诉去浇或修理，真正成为村上人们的一个老靠依。杀麻打靛时，胖孩与技术委员会王福生老汉研究，要赶快打靛池，迟了就要少收靛。在群众中讨论宣布后马上就要做，可是人们都又圪吵起来，小狗组里人说：“胖孩组有福元二人，真是金银玉石一伙伙一条心，就上天津北京吧，怕不行哩！”有的说“他都弄吧，他沤完了咱再弄，成不了就打上没种，咱没个好计划家还能打成靛池。”胖孩听说后，马上把他组模范组员史福元调到小狗组给大家计划，立即得到欢迎，并把福元选为小组长。当时要抽全劳力修筑靛池，赶快沤蓝，麻又即刻就得杀，村上人手顾不过来，胖孩就给大家商量好，把妇女儿童组织起来杀麻，有经验的老汉削麻梢，为了鼓励妇女儿童的积极，把儿童挣的工票每天作一百元，归儿童买书用。妇女挣的与家庭三七分红，在这样有计划的组织领导下，七个沤靛池三个澄池很快就建筑好了。麻也杀完了，计算下来小蓝每亩产七十斤，折合十四石粮，全村四十五亩就顶粮食六百三十石，兴奋得大家都说：“组织起来就是能渡过难关”。
    三月间，正是准备粪土修理地边的时候，村里的人可都到处闲坐溜逛。当时村里的粪按每亩二十担计，仅够七百五十亩地之用，缺粪很多。胖孩看着劲头不对，就给大家谈，地是根本，不上粪按不上富根！”又细心地拿事实给大家算了个帐：裕锁家二口人，种十七八亩地，不上粪，麻长的一尺高，打下粮食不够吃；满盛家五口人，也是种的十七八亩地，上粪最多，去年每亩大麦就打了三石九斗，收下粮食吃不了。”这些老实话打通了大家的思想，胖孩并提出上粪向满盛学样，在他带头下，全村每亩地都上了二十四担粪，庄稼长的特别好。
    锄苗时，互助组又出了问题，有的垮了，有的觉得吃亏怕说落后不言语，如马旺则说：“咱锄上一亩顶十分，别人锄六分也顶十分，”石水则说：“还不如打短工哩，做了活得不到工资米”，黑孩说：“咱一步三按又干净顶十分，他都锄的毛胡连点也是十分”！胖孩发现后，和大家商量，经过圪吵又有了办法，决定很快把各组帐算清，规定按活计工，锄完那块返回检查当时发工票。并且重新找对心事人碰组，九组合并为五组，各组劲头都大起来。史福元当时在第四组，到处流逛不劳动，全组都不满意他，不跟他互助，弄的他孤立起来。福元没了法找着胖孩，胖孩答应了他，耐心的给他说：“若来我组可得听我组的话哩。”经过胖孩两个月的耐心说，福元成了数一数二的模范组员，打靛池时，原来的组又要他回去并选为组长。
    为了伙锄追肥多打粮，胖孩领导大家成立了技术委员会，选出经验丰富的程黑孩等五人负责，全村谷玉茭普遍锄过三遍，金皇后五遍，三分之二的谷、玉茭上过追肥。
    在胖孩他们生产技术委员会领导下，全村真正做到“八仙过海，各显其能”。使全村人人有事做，人人都沾光。今秋算下来，崔彰全村二千一百九十五亩地（地主土地不在内）共产粮食三千八百零四石一，其中一六二亩麻，每亩收成折粮四石，共合六四八石，四五亩蓝，每亩合粮十四石，共合六三○石，五八亩烟，每亩收成合粮四石，共二三二石。副业收入折合谷一百九十石零九，总共三九九五石。全村四○八人（地主人口收入均不在内），按当地情况每人全年开支以六石五斗粗粮计（吃、穿、用、生产投资均在内），共消费二六五二石，下余一三四三石，耕二余一还余三十四石。
