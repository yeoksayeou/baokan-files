　　【This dispatch from Taiyue on the 17th】A female hero, Ru Guixiang, has emerged in the autumn plowing in Jiangli Village, Yangcheng. At the village's women's meeting on October 16th, when it was proposed that "women should make contributions in the plowing land," Ru Guixiang responded loudly, "Our group guarantees to autumn plow 42 mu." After returning, she immediately discussed it in the group and divided the twelve members into four groups, with two who know how to plow leading one who does not know how to plow, and mobilized four iron plows and four large old plows to start autumn plowing. Ru Guixiang wanted to plow quickly and well, and also wanted to teach apprentices. Her teaching method was: she plowed the head of the field, and then called the apprentice to plow in the middle, teaching them from how to hold the plow to how to direct the ox. In nine days, she taught Zhang Xiaoxuan, Liu Xiaoxuan, Shang Xiaohua, and Zhang Xiaofeng. After inspection, labor hero Li Baoquan said: "The women's plowing is good, walking into the field is like falling into a flour vat, it's very soft." Ru Guixiang's group plowed a total of 96 mu in nine days, exceeding the original plan by more than double. When Yang Yanshi from Hebei Kou learned about this, she insisted on having Ru Guixiang's group plow her land.

　　匠礼秋耕中出现女英雄
    【本报太岳十七日电】阳城匠礼村秋垡中，出现女英雄茹贵香。在十月十六日全村妇女会议上，当提出：“妇女要在垡地中立功”，茹贵香首先响亮的响应：“我组保证秋垡四十二亩”，回去后即在全组中讨论，并把十二个组员以两个会垡的带一不会垡的分为四个小组，并调了四张铁犁，四个大老犁，即开始秋垡。茹贵香一面要垡的快，垡的好，另一面要教徒弟。她的教法是：自己犁地头，当中叫徒弟犁，从捉犁教起，一直到如何指使牛。九天里便教会了张小宣、刘小宣、尚小花、张小风四人。劳动英雄李保全检查后说：“妇女犁的就是好，走进地里象跌在面缸里，虚得很。”茹贵香组九天内共犁地九十六亩，超过原计划一倍多。河北口杨阎氏知道了，硬要叫茹贵香组去给她犁地。
