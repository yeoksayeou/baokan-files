    [Lincheng News from our newspaper] With the autumn harvest largely completed and wheat mostly sown, the villages in the First District are actively reorganizing their textile organizations to prepare for the upcoming hundred-day textile drive. In Beimeng Village, where textile production was previously unorganized, the Women's Federation Chairman Zhao Xiaoji and production committee member Wang Fuzhi, through patient persuasion and education, have organized thirteen textile groups and modified fifty-two hand-cranked spinning machines. In Nanmeng Village, Yangjia Street and Zhengjia Street challenged each other during the textile reorganization process. Under the leadership of the Women's Federation, they organized four large spinning machine groups with forty-two female spinners, who have already begun evening textile work. Dongzhen has organized eight textile groups with one hundred and twenty female spinners, ensuring that one hundred and twenty-five spinning wheels are in operation every evening. In Dongshang, when reorganizing textile production, women expressed a lack of funds to purchase hand-cranked shuttles. The Farmers' Association Chairman Yang Xinshun used his own money to lend to the women to buy nine hand-cranked shuttles. The credit cooperative also provided loans of 82,000 yuan to address the shortage of raw materials. The whole village has now organized four brigades and nine groups, and implemented an equal-value exchange system using fractional tickets. The work point system is as follows: weaving two zhang of cloth, spinning ten liang of thread, and beating three jin of hemp or reeling four jin of thread is equivalent to one work point. Nihe and other villages have also been organized and have begun to take action. Currently, according to statistics from thirty villages in the district, three hundred and seventeen textile groups have been organized with one thousand four hundred and fifteen female spinners.

    [Lincheng News from our newspaper] After the Third District held meetings on October 8th to celebrate the victory of the Great Counter-Offensive, women throughout the district responded enthusiastically to the call of "Everything for Supporting the Frontline" and universally launched a textile drive during the breaks from the autumn harvest and wheat planting. An elderly military dependent in Liangkou Village, in her fifties, said: "To defeat Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible so that my son can return home for a reunion, I must step up textile production to buy grain and hand over more counter-offensive grain." She spins under the moonlight at night and puts on her clothes in the morning and sits in bed and starts spinning. She can spin eight liang of cotton in one night and early morning. Furthermore, under the promotion of the Women's Federation's Jie Wen×, the nine groups in the whole village, consisting of one hundred and five people, weaved 251 jin of cloth and spun 350 jin of cotton, earning a total of over 360,000 yuan in foreign currency. According to the weaving statistics of eighteen villages, there are a total of sixty-two groups, four hundred and sixty-eight people, earning a total of over 1,360,000 yuan in foreign currency. At the current grain price of 2,500 yuan per dou of millet, this can be sold for over 540 shi of grain. The textile drive is currently expanding. (Niu Shirong, Zhang Shushen)
