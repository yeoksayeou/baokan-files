    Commemorating Lu Xun in Beiping and Tianjin
    On the 19th of last month, the eleventh anniversary of the death of our country's revolutionary literary giant Lu Xun, students in Beiping and Tianjin, despite the rampant activities of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit secret agents, still gathered to commemorate him.
    In Beiping, students held a memorial meeting at the Peking University auditorium on the morning of that day, which included reports on Lu Xun's life and poetry recitations. In addition to holding an exhibition of Lu Xun's books and publications during the day, the Peking University wall newspaper association also held a memorial gathering in the evening, inviting professors Feng Zhi, Li Guangtian, and Ding Yi to give speeches, and there were recitations and short plays. Various wall newspapers also published commemorative issues. The Nankai New Poetry Society and the Literary Society of Tianjin also held a memorial evening at the school's Democracy Hall at 8 pm on the same day. Professor Guo Guangyi gave a speech on "Lu Xun's Works," and Professor Zhang Daoke spoke on "Lu Xun's Thought and Path." There were also programs such as a discussion of Lu Xun's posthumous work "The Passerby," with more than 300 people participating.
