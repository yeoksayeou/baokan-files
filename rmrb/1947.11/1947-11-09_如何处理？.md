    How to Handle It?

    Comrade Editor:
    There is a poor peasant youth (twenty-seven years old) in Village ×, Fifth District, Zuoquan, who joined the secret service. At the request of the masses, the government executed him by shooting, and his personal property was also confiscated. His wife and children are from poor peasant backgrounds and are still living a poor peasant life. Can she be allocated a share of the fruits of land reform like ordinary poor peasants? The masses are currently discussing this issue. There are many similar issues, and we hope you can answer them in the newspaper!
            (Zi Sheng, Yu Xi from the Zuoquan Fifth District Office)

    Comrades Zi Sheng and Yu Xi:
    The question you raised is indeed important, but the information is insufficient, and we cannot answer it at present. What kind of poor peasant was this youth? Under what circumstances did the masses demand his execution? What was the nature and activities of his involvement with the secret service? On what grounds did the government carry out the execution? What are the masses' opinions on the issue of his family members? Have you discussed this issue? What are your proposed solutions? How many similar issues are there? What is the process? Please provide detailed information as soon as possible!
          The Editor

    如何处理？编辑同志：
    左权五区×村有一个贫雇青年（二十七岁），参加了特务，在群众要求下，政府枪决了，他个人的财产也没收了，他的老婆孩子系贫雇出身，如今仍过的贫农生活，她是否可以和一般贫雇一样分到一份果实呢？这个问题群众正在酝酿中这类问题还不少，希望你们在报上答复一下为盼！
            （子胜、玉喜于左权五区公所）子胜、玉喜同志：
    所提问题确是重要，但材料不充分，当下没办法答复。究竟该青年是什么样的贫雇？在什么情况下群众要求处死？参加特务的情形和活动是些什么？政府根据什么理由执行枪决？对他家属问题群众酝酿中有何表示？你们对此问题有否讨论？处理意见怎样？这类问题究竟有多少？经过如何？请即详细告知为盼！
