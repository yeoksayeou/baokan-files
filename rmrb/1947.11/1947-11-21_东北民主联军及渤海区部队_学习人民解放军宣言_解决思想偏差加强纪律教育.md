Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 17th. The Democratic Allied Army's certain column seized the gap between wars to study the People's Liberation Army's Double Tenth Declaration and the newly promulgated Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention. In the past half month, after the report of the leaders on the situation of the great counter-offensive, discussions and debates have initially solved the three ideological deviations of quick victory, doubt, and paralysis existing in some cadres and soldiers. This study is combined with specific ideas and the autumn offensive. The army newspaper has published a large number of popular current affairs speaking materials, drawn counter-offensive situation maps, autumn offensive answers, and reports of counter-offensive victories on various fronts. The propaganda team arranged small operas, counter-offensive skits, and快板 (kuaiban, a form of rhythmic storytelling) for performances in various troops. In addition to a few cadres of the education authority who persisted in daily work, the rest went to the company to help guide the study. The study of the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention was more in-depth and specific. A certain division carried out the study in a way that combined education and inspection. The army newspaper published an editorial, emphasizing that this is the key to winning the war. Based on the shortcomings that have been exposed in the troops, it is estimated that the universal problems that may be encountered in combat are repeatedly put forward to strictly implement the various provisions of the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention, and each item is explained with emphasis, and the error of thinking that one can take the landlord's things casually after speaking out grievances is criticized. In the study, cadres and soldiers raised questions based on specific situations and展开研究 (zhankai yanjiu, carried out research). A certain unit’s “all-round model company” spent a day discussing the undisciplined behavior of taking bowls from the common people, so that everyone had a deep understanding of the provision of “not taking a needle or thread from the masses.” Then the company launched a “check plan” (ie check discipline) movement, and solved the problem of "using a soft attitude or a hard attitude when borrowing things." Now the "check plan" movement has been popularized in various troops. Many cadres and soldiers have re-amended their meritorious service plans after pouring out their grievances. Huang Zhongyue, the company commander of the second company of a certain unit, used to think that the troops could not take care of the discipline of the masses when fighting. After this study, he put "not violating the discipline of the masses" as the first item in his plan for meritorious service. After this study, the troops showed vigorous vitality, and their fighting will was even stronger. For example, in the battle of Bailongju Mountain near Fanjiatun, the unit annihilated a regiment of the New First Army's Provisional Fifty-sixth Division with a regiment of troops.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 11th. The Bohai Military Region troops enthusiastically study and publicize the People's Liberation Army Declaration. The Political Department of the Military Region has formulated a study outline, calling on leaders of all troops to be responsible for organizing their subordinates to conduct studies in conjunction with the Three Check-ups Movement, and formulate specific implementation plans for the future based on the military-civilian relations, officer-soldier relations, and the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention proposed in the declaration. In addition to pointing out that all departments will use the PLA declaration and the sixty-seven slogans as regular propaganda tasks, they will also conduct a surprise propaganda campaign. Various organs and companies organized propaganda groups to use mass gatherings, markets, literacy classes, etc. to explain the declaration slogans, post declaration slogans, and make wall slogans to make the countryside look new.

　　东北民主联军及渤海区部队
    学习人民解放军宣言
    解决思想偏差加强纪律教育
    【新华社东北前线十七日电】民主联军某纵队抓紧战争间隙，学习人民解放军双十节宣言及新颁布之三大纪律八项注意。半月来关于大反攻形势部分经过首长传达报告，座谈辩论，已初步解决了部分干部及战士中存在的速胜、怀疑与麻庳三种思想偏差。这次学习与具体思想及秋季攻势行动相结合，部队报纸曾以大量篇幅登载通俗时事讲话材料，绘制反攻形势图、秋季攻势回答、各线反攻捷报等。宣传队编排了小型歌剧、反攻活报、快板等在各部队中演出。教育机关干部除留少数坚持日常工作外，余均到连队帮助指导学习。对于三大纪律八项注意的学习，更为深入具体。某师曾以教育与检查结合的方式进行学习。部队报纸发表社论，强调指出这是争取战争胜利的关键，并根据目前部队中已暴露的缺点，估计在作战中可能遇到的普遍性的问题，反复提出严格执行三大纪律八项注意规定的各条，并有重点的逐条解释，批判了由于诉苦后发生的认为可以随便取用地主的东西的错误观点。在学习中干部与战士都依据具体情况提出问题，展开研究。某部“全面模范连”费了一天时间，专门讨论拿老百姓碗的犯纪律行为，使大家对“不拿群众一针一线”的规定有了深刻的认识。接着该连即掀起“查计划”（即查纪律）运动，解决了“借物时用软态度还是用硬态度”的问题。现“查计划”运动已普遍各部队。许多干部和战士都重新修改了诉苦后所订的立功计划。某部二连连长黄钟月过去认为部队打起仗来顾不了群众纪律，经过此次学习在自己立功计划中把“不违犯群众纪律”作为头一条。部队经过这一学习表现了生气蓬勃，战斗意志更加坚强，如此次范家屯附近白龙驹山战斗，该部以一个团兵力，歼敌新一军暂五十六师之一个团。
    【新华社华东十一日电】渤海军区部队热烈学习与宣传人民解放军宣言，军区政治部已制出学习大纲，号召各部队首长负责组织所属结合三查运动进行学习，并依据宣言中提出的军民关系、官兵关系，及三大纪律、八项注意，订出今后具体执行计划。除指出各部将解放军宣言与六十七条口号作为经常宣传任务外，并进行一次突击宣传运动。各机关、连队组织宣传小组利用群众集会、市集、识字班等，进行对宣言口号的解释，张贴宣言口号，制写墙壁标语，使农村面目一新。
