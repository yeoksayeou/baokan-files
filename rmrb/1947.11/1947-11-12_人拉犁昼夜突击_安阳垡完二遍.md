　　People Pull Ploughs Day and Night in a Concentrated Effort:
  　Anyang Completes Second Plowing
    [Our Newspaper, Pingshun Dispatch] The second plowing of land in Anyang, the seventh district, began on the 25th of last month. The entire village has 1,520 mu of autumn fields and 37 head of livestock. The original plan was to complete the second plowing of all the land within twelve days, from the 25th to November 5th. Under the slogan of vigorously counterattacking and rushing to hand over counterattack grain to capture Chiang Kai-shek alive, the enthusiasm of the masses for autumn cultivation and grain milling was further boosted. Labor hero Cui Fubao, in order to complete the plan ahead of schedule, took the lead by organizing a team of people, mainly poor and lower-middle peasants, to pull ploughs. Five people pulled one plough, plowing 3.86 mu of land per day. This was combined with delivering autumn fertilizer and milling public grain. Men pulled ploughs and delivered fertilizer during the day, while women and children pushed the millstone during the day, and men took turns pushing at night. Under such intense circumstances, the entire team victoriously completed the second autumn plowing on the 2nd of this month, three days ahead of schedule. At the same time, they completed the delivery of 1,200 jin of public grain for the entire team within three days. Under his leadership and influence, the teams of Wang Ruizhe and Li Jiaying also completed the second plowing.
    The teams of Shen Qibin and Ping Panghai, not wanting to lag behind, also organized two teams of people to pull ploughs. Shen Qibin's team had five people pulling one plough, plowing 4.1 mu of land per day. That night, the two ploughs plowed another 2 mu of land under the moonlight. With such an active sprint, all 1,520 mu of autumn fields in the entire village were completed with the second plowing on the 3rd of this month. On the 3rd, over 15,000 jin of public grain for the entire village were also collected and ready for transportation. (Xiang Rong, Ji Qiu)
