　　Taihang Third Special District Directly Subordinate Factories Summarize Production Increase
  　Quantity, Quality, and Technology All Improved
  　Second Sub-district Bomb Factory Contributes Over 700,000 Yuan to Support the Front
    [This newspaper, Taihang, 15th dispatch] The directly subordinate factories of the Third Special District held a grand model selection conference from October 23rd to 27th. The conference summarized the three consecutive production increase campaigns from "February 7th" to October 15th, a period of nine and a half months. Through the exchange of experiences and comparison of achievements, model units such as the Military Region Bomb Factory, Jia Zhang Coal Mine, Huafeng and Machine Factory, and Taiwu Militia Factory were selected. After nine and a half months of production increase campaigns, under the guiding principle of comprehensive transformation and comprehensive improvement, and through full mobilization, great achievements have been made: In terms of production quantity, the average increase of each factory was 61.2% compared to before "February 7th." In terms of quality, each bomb made by the Bomb Factory exploded into an average of ×× to ×× pieces; the cotton gin in the Huafeng Factory could gin 80 jin of cotton per day, a two-fold increase compared to before, and the rifles made by the Taiwu Factory could fire hundreds of bullets continuously. There has also been a significant improvement in technology. According to statistics from six factories, 205 apprentices have been trained, 19 new tools have been created, and 47 tools have been improved in seven factories. The electric saw at Huafeng has increased efficiency sevenfold; the groove pressing machine at the Bomb Factory has increased efficiency threefold, and the percussion cap pressing machine has increased efficiency sixfold; the knurling tool at Taiwu has increased threefold. It is particularly valuable that under the material difficulties of the liberated areas, they were able to make lathes, washing machines, planers, sterilizers, gauze, sandpaper, coolers, etc. In addition, workers persisted in their studies amidst their busy work, improving their cultural level. Each factory has a certain learning system and facilities such as wall newspapers and blackboards. Among the staff and workers of the research institute, in the atmosphere of mutual teaching and learning, those who learned 200 to 300 characters accounted for 30.5%, and those who learned arithmetic addition and subtraction accounted for 31%. Based on the conscious effort to support the front and overthrow Chiang Kai-shek, the staff and workers in six factories processed more than 66,000 hours and voluntarily contributed over 3,490,000 yuan in silver to support the front. During the campaign, 229 activists emerged (six factories). Finally, Comrade Wang Deshui of the workers' union pointed out that because we have grasped ideological leadership and ideological mobilization, and at the same time implemented the democratic spirit and the principle of mutual benefit in leadership, and followed the correct path of investigation, research, and scientific calculation in management, we have achieved such results, which has powerfully supported the patriotic war.
    [This newspaper] The Second Sub-district Bomb Factory contributed a total of 761,000 yuan in silver to support the front. Squad leader Wang Huaisheng contributed 20,000 yuan. When family member Zhao Yumei saw everyone contributing money, she also contributed a pair of new shoes made by herself. All staff and workers were in high spirits. (Yang Hongyuan)

  　二分区炸弹所支前献金七十余万元
    【本报太行十五日电】此间三专区直属工厂，于十月二十三日到二十七日，召开了隆重的比选模范大会。会上总结了从“二、七”到十月十五日九个半月中，接连三次的增产运动。经过交流经验、比成绩，选出军区炸弹所、贾掌煤矿、华丰和机器厂、太武民兵工厂等模范单位。经过九个半月的增产运动，在全面改造，全面提高的方针下，经过全面发动，取得很大成绩：生产数量上，较“二七”前各工厂平均增产百分之六十一点二。质量上，炸弹所所造炸弹每个平均炸到××片到××片；华丰厂弹花机一天能弹八十斤，较前提高一倍，太武厂造的步枪，能连打百粒子弹。在技术上亦有显著提高，据六个厂的统计，培养成学徒二百零五个，创造新工具十九种。七个厂改良工具四十七件，华丰的电锯提高效率七倍；炸弹所压壑机提高效率三倍，压火帽机提高六倍；太武的滚花刀提高三倍。特别是在解放区的物质困难条件下，能做出元车、洗床、刨床、消毒器、沙布、沙纸、冷却器等，是值得宝贵的。另外工人在繁忙的工作中，坚持了学习，提高了文化，各厂均有一定的学习制度及壁报、黑板报等设备。研究所职工在互教互学风气中，工人学会二百字到三百字的占百分之一卅点五，学会算术加减的占百分之卅一。职工们在支援前线打倒蒋介石的自觉基础上，六个厂加工六万六千余小时，自动献金支援前线大洋三百四十九万余元。运动中涌现出积极分子二百二十九个（六个厂）。最后职工会王得水同志指出：由于我们掌握了思想领导与思想发动，同时在领导上贯澈了民主精神，两利原则；经营上走了调查研究科学计算的正确道路，因而取得如此成绩，有力的支援了爱国战争。
