Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: Comprehensive reports: The United Nations General Assembly finally passed the US imperialist proposal to establish a "Little Assembly" on the 13th. The purpose of establishing this temporary committee or standing committee, which exists between the two General Assembly sessions, is to usurp the powers of the Security Council and overturn the veto power. TASS reported on the 16th: "This is an even more illegal decision, undermining the foundation of international cooperation." At the General Assembly, the US representative tried his best to defend his crime of undermining the United Nations. The British representative repeatedly stated that the Security Council was "paralyzed" and demanded that issues under the Security Council's jurisdiction be handed over to the General Assembly for disposal. The Soviet and Ukrainian representatives delivered important speeches exposing the matter. Vyshinsky, after emphasizing that the establishment of a standing committee would violate the Charter and usurp the powers of the Security Council, pointed out the relationship between this and the US-British diplomatic policy. He said: "The diplomatic policy of the Anglo-American bloc, headed by the United States, is to pursue world hegemony. This kind of diplomatic policy is bound to use economic and financial power and organizational tricks to undermine international cooperation." Manuilsky refuted the British representative, saying: "If we can truly say that the United Nations organization is paralyzed, it is primarily because certain national groups are violating the Charter, because one or two countries are attempting to use the United Nations as a tool for their diplomatic policies." In analyzing whether the Standing Committee is an auxiliary body, he said: "This committee holds the dual powers of the General Assembly and the Security Council, because the British and Americans hold a majority in the Security Council, they can hand over any issue to the Standing Committee without difficulty. In this way, the Standing Committee becomes the highest body above the Security Council, and can decide all issues without being bound by the principle of unanimity among the great powers. You control the majority, you can manipulate it at will."

　　美英破坏国际合作基础
  　联大竟通过设小型大会
    【新华社陕北二十日电】综合报导：联合国大会十三日终于通过了美帝国主义设立小型大会的建议。设立这个处在两届大会之间的临时委员会或驻会委员会，其目的是篡夺安理会和推翻否决权。塔斯社十六日电称：“这是一个更非法的决定，破坏了国际合作的基础。”在大会上，美代表竭力为其破坏联合国之罪行辩护。英代表则口口声声说安理会陷于“瘫痪”，要求把安理会管辖的问题交给大会处置。苏联与乌克兰代表先后作了揭发性的重要演说。维辛斯基在强调成立驻会委员会即图违反宪章、篡夺安理会之后，指出这与美英外交方针的关系。他说：“以美国为首的英美集团外交政策，即是追求世界霸权。这种外交政策，首先就必然利用经济财政力量和组织上的技俩来破坏国际合作。”曼努伊斯基则驳斥英代表说：“假如我们真能说联合国组织被瘫痪，那末，首先就是因为某些国家集团破坏宪章，由于一两个国家企图以联合国为其外交政策的工具。”在分析驻委会是否辅助机构时，他说：“这一委员会握有大会与安理会的双重权力，因为英美在安理会中占有多数，他们能毫无困难地把任何问题交给驻委会。这样，驻委会就成了立于安理会之上的最高机构，可能不受大国一致原则的约束而决定一切问题。你们控制着大多数，你们可以任意摆布它。”
