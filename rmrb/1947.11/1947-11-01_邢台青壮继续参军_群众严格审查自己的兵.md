    Xingtai's Youth Continue to Enlist
    The Masses Strictly Scrutinize Their Soldiers
    Labor Hero Shi Zhenming's Team Sends Ninety Men to the Battlefield
    [This newspaper, Xingtai News] In Dajia Village, Fifth District, under the slogans "Fight to Nanjing and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive" and "Liberate Shijiazhuang and Taiyuan, capture landlords and traitors alive, and hand them over to the masses for trial," the youth enthusiastically enlisted in the army. On October 17th, the masses discussed the current situation. Militia member Zhang Chengzhai said, "The landlord Wen Qingzhi from our village is in charge of the Kuomintang's Home Returning Corps in Shijiazhuang, wielding a command knife to kill our compatriots." The Deputy Director of the Armed Forces Committee said, "Enlist in the army to capture the landlord Wen Qingzhi alive and hand him over to the masses in our village for trial." Village Chief Zhang Guanghao said, "My uncle and cousin were killed by the Japanese colluding with Chiang Kai-shek, and my father is still in the KMT-controlled area. Now father cannot see son, and son cannot see father." He was the first to sign up to join the army. Led by the village chief, deputy director, and others, 109 young men from the whole village signed up to join the army. The masses said, "The soldiers are our own soldiers, and we must be responsible for them. Soldiers must be elite soldiers, and horses must be good horses." Therefore, the masses automatically rose up to scrutinize their own soldiers, and 68 were screened out. Those who were screened out said, "We cannot go to the front lines; we will join the militia in the rear." 217 people signed up to join the militia. Qicun proposed three things to avoid when screening new recruits. After strict review by the masses, out of 595 applicants from 38 villages, 355 were approved for enlistment.

    [Another report] The Eleventh District is seeing a surge in enlistments. Zhang Jiangyong from Xihuang Village said, "I used to smoke opium, and I was about to become a beggar, but the Eighth Route Army came and saved my whole family. I want my son to go and fight the Chiang bandits." Cao Fengyun is a decorated veteran who is going to the battlefield for the second time. Old military family member Liu Zhongkui is sixty years old and suggested that since he cannot go to the front line himself, he will provide more grain in the village, and since his family has two donkeys, he will let other military families in the village use them. As young people signed up one after another, a total of 49 people enrolled. Cadres took the lead in Xijing Village, with 12 young people signing up. In two days, a total of 407 people in the entire district signed up to join the counter-offensive army. On the 21st, soldiers from various villages entered the meeting place for inspection. During the inspection, some young people, fearing they were not qualified, stood on stones under their feet while in line. Some cried loudly when they were not selected. The new soldiers who passed the inspection had smiles on their faces, standing neatly and going to the county to enlist. (Quanshun, Xiuzeng, Shengguang, Gongbiao)
    [This newspaper] On the morning of the 18th, after hearing the news of enlistment, more than forty students from Xingtai Teachers College, including Mu Taiheng and Ma Suyuan, eagerly signed up with the Education Department, requesting the school to allow them to go to the front lines to fight and kill Old Chiang. Currently, eleven comrades, including Mu Taiheng, Ren Shoutian, Liu Shujun, and Li Xing, have passed the inspection. Female students have been rushing to knit sweaters and socks and make honorary flowers for the new soldiers. Each class automatically initiated donations, and the whole school raised more than 97,000 Jichaos, giving each person two pairs of new shoes and socks, a towel, a toothbrush, and a diary. On the afternoon of the 19th, at 3 p.m., the whole school held a grand send-off meeting. (Zhu Tang)
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 28th dispatch] In order to support the great counter-offensive, 2,500 emancipated peasants from Changzi enlisted overnight. On October 21st, when district and village cadres throughout the county discussed the great counter-offensive, they all said, "To eliminate the old roots of the landlord Chiang Kai-shek, emancipated peasants must join the People's Liberation Army." After the cadres returned to their villages, a huge wave of joining the People's Liberation Army was set off that night. All cadres, activists, and the masses stayed up all night, rushing to sign up. Some parents sent their sons to join the army, some older brothers sent their younger brothers, wives sent their husbands, and younger sisters sent their older brothers. In just one day, 2,500 emancipated peasants enlisted. At the send-off meetings in various villages, all the new soldiers expressed their determination "not to return home until Chiang Kai-shek is overthrown." Those who remained at home immediately responded to the new soldiers heading to the front lines with three major guarantees: not to leave an acre of land uncultivated, not to leave an acre of autumn stubble land, and not to allow military families to suffer any difficulties.
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 30th dispatch] Floating Mountain labor hero Shi Zhenming personally sent ninety young men from five villages, including Fancun, to join the People's Liberation Army. The original plan for these five villages was to mobilize forty-six people, but because Shi Zhenming personally led students from the Sixth High School to conduct in-depth propaganda about the victory of Liu Deng and Chen Xie's southern expedition, the masses were ecstatic. Within two days, ninety people signed up to join the army, exceeding the task by one hundred percent. Guan Zhaofang from Tuling Village led his nephew and cousins, Guan Ziliang, Guan Wenhui, and Guo Yuxiu, four members of his family, to enlist collectively. Yan Wanlan, a seventeen-year-old from Lingshang Village (student at the Sixth High School), ran to the school to sign up to join the army. The teacher said he was too young, and he cried, saying, "During the Anti-Japanese War, Chiang Kai-shek's army did not resist, and the Japanese killed my father. Two years ago, the Sixty-first Army dragged away our cattle. I want to avenge this." Seeing his determination, the teacher had to allow it. On the 27th, as soon as the rain stopped, the old hero Shi personally sent the new soldiers to the district. Men and women, old and young, poured out from various villages to see them off, and the procession was four or five li long. Retired soldier Old Li said in a hoarse voice, "With the masses' morale so high, how can we worry about not overthrowing even ten Chiang Kai-sheks?"
