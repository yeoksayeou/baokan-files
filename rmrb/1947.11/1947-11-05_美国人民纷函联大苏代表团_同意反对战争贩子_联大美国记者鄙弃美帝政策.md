Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: TASS, New York, 31st reports: Letters from Americans to the Soviet delegation are increasing daily, filled with dissatisfaction toward the US government's foreign policy. These letters consistently convey a feeling, a thought, and a hope: to oppose warmongers, strengthen international cooperation, and adhere to friendship with the Soviet Union. Furthermore, a Pravda special correspondent at the UN reports: A survey conducted by Newsweek magazine among UN journalists reveals the American people's contempt for their own country's imperialist policies. Forty-five major journalists stationed at the UN participated in this survey, ninety percent of whom were Americans. Their answers stated: Those who report on the State Department's policies do not believe what they write. Sixty-two percent of the main journalists reporting on UN news do not believe that the US delegation's policies are strengthening the United Nations. Forty percent of the journalists declared that this policy does not conform to the interests of the American people. Out of the forty-five journalists, only nine believed that the US delegation's policies "strengthened" the United Nations. Newsweek, in summarizing its survey, had to admit frankly: "The majority of American journalists stationed at the UN, although praising the US position daily, are clearly disloyal."

    美国人民纷函联大苏代表团
    同意反对战争贩子
    联大美国记者鄙弃美帝政策
    【新华社陕北三日电】据塔斯社纽约三十一日讯：美国人致苏联代表团的信件日益增加，信件中充溢着对美国政府外交政策的不满。这些信件一致渗透着一种感情、一种思想和一种希望，这就是：反对战争贩子，加强国际合作，坚持与苏联的友谊。又据真理报联大特派记者报导：美国新闻周刊顷向联大记者进行测验结果，显示美国人民对其本国帝国主义政策的鄙弃。参加这一测验的，是驻联大的四十五位主要报人，其中百分之九十都是美国人。他们的答案说：报导国务院政策的人们，不相信自己所写的东西。百分之六十二报导联大消息的主要记者都不认为美国代表团的政策是替联合国增加力量。百分之四十的记者宣称：这一政策不符合美国人民的利益。四十五个记者中，只有九人是认为美国代表团的政策“加强”了联合国的。新闻周刊总结其测验时，不得不坦白承认：“驻联大的大多数美国记者，虽每日赞扬美国立场，但显然是不忠实的。”
