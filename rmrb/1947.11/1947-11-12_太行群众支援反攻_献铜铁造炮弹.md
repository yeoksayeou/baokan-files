　　Taihang Masses Support the Counter-Offensive
  　Donating Copper and Iron to Make Shells
    [This newspaper’s Taihang dispatch, 9th] The Taihang area is enthusiastically donating copper and iron, and women are rushing to make shoes for the victorious army. Zhang Shuhe, a woman from Xincun Village in Neiqiu, said, "The army will have to travel a lot when they reach the Yangtze River, and they'll need shoes. I want to quickly make two pairs of victory shoes so the soldiers can walk even faster." Under her leadership, every woman is vying to make victory shoes. Women from Gaojiacun Village in Gaoyi made seventy pairs of durable and good-looking military shoes and handed them over to the village office for forwarding to the front lines. Military dependent Old Lady Liu, holding the shoes she made with her own hands, said to the village chief, "These are for my child. Tell him to wear these shoes and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive." Twenty-two honorably retired soldiers from Wu乡 and Zanhuang donated all of their savings of 11,560 catties of millet to the soldiers at the front. Liu Zhaoxiang said, "I am disabled and can no longer go to the front lines. I am willing to send my savings of 2,400 catties of rice to the front, so that the soldiers can eat their fill and defeat Chiang Kai-shek soon, and then return for a reunion." Under the slogan "Donate copper and iron to make shells, Chiang's bandits will soon be finished!", Lincheng County villages launched a movement to donate copper, iron, and tin. The villages of Shigu and Zhongduwei alone donated 120 catties of copper, iron, and tin, and 1,476 catties of copper coins.

　　太行群众支援反攻
  　献铜铁造炮弹
    【本报太行九日电】太行各地纷纷捐献铜铁，妇女赶作胜利军鞋。内邱新村妇女张书合说：“军队到了长江边跑路多，费鞋，我要赶快做两双胜利鞋，叫战士穿上走的更快些”，在她带头下，每个妇女都争做胜利鞋。高邑高家庄妇女赶做了七十双又耐实又好看的军鞋交给村公所转送前方。军属刘老太拿着她亲手做好的鞋和村长说：“这是我给俺孩做的，叫他穿上这双鞋活捉蒋贼”。武乡、赞皇二十二位荣退军人，将自己节省的一万一千五百六十斤小米，全部献给前线战士，刘兆祥说：“我残废了不能再到前线，愿将自己节省的二千四百斤米送往前方，让战士们吃饱早日打败蒋介石，回来团圆”。临城各村在：“献铜献铁造炮弹，蒋贼不久就完蛋”的口号下，展开献铜铁锡运动，仅石固、中笃围两村印献出铜铁锡一百二十斤，铜元一千四百七十六斤。
