Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 24th: According to a report in the Shanghai Observation Weekly, Vol. 3, No. 11, regarding the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' arrest and massacre of Zhejiang University martyr Yu Zisan: On October 25th, Yu Zisan, a senior student in the Department of Agronomy at Zhejiang University, and Li Bojin, a senior student in the Department of Agricultural Economics, went to celebrate the wedding of their alumnus, Mr. Wang. Chen Jianxin, who worked at Shanghai Zhidao Girls' School, and Huang Shimin, from the Chiang Kai-shek Farmers Bank, also arrived in Hangzhou by car that day to offer their congratulations. They had a pleasant time catching up. At around 10 p.m., when Yu and Li planned to return to school, the school bus had already left. Li suffered from a chronic foot ailment and found it inconvenient to travel at night. Yu also needed to attend the memorial service for the late Zhejiang University President Zhang the next morning. For convenience, they stayed overnight in the room rented by Chen and Huang at the Datong Hotel. At around 2 a.m. that night, Chiang Kai-shek's military police unreasonably arrested the four during a hotel inspection. They had no warrant and did not explain the reason for the arrest.

The Zhejiang University Student Union was outraged upon learning of this and immediately presented two just demands to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits on the 27th: immediate release and a guarantee that similar incidents would not occur in the future. They also approached the Chiang Kai-shek authorities separately to negotiate. The Chiang Kai-shek Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Security Command initially tried to deny it, claiming "ignorance." However, after a serious protest, they admitted that all four were being held in the police station's prison and falsely promised to transfer them to the Chiang Kai-shek court on the 28th. By the 28th, they had gone back on their word and still did not transfer them. By this point, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' prevarication and cover-up were extremely obvious. All students at Zhejiang University then decided that if the Chiang Kai-shek bandits did not release the four arrested students by the evening of the 29th, the entire school would go on strike starting on the 30th.

After committing the crime, the Chiang Kai-shek Security Command, feeling guilty, shamelessly pressured the ailing "President Zhu to sign a statement certifying that he had seen Mr. Yu commit suicide," but Zhu refused. Thus, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' plot to murder Yu, the martyr, was thwarted, and their guilt was exposed. That night, when the news of the murder of Martyr Yu reached Zhejiang University, the entire school launched a strike to oppose the massacre and fight for freedom. All the professors were also extremely indignant and, together with the students, resolutely advocated: investigating the truth about the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' murder of Martyr Yu Zisan and accusing the Chiang Kai-shek Zhejiang Security Command of deliberate murder.

After committing the crime, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits attempted to falsely claim that Martyr Yu Zisan had "died by suicide," but even the "Observation" weekly, which was related to the Chiang Kai-shek officialdom, had to hesitantly reveal some of the truth about the tragedy. The article pointed out that Martyr Yu's "head and face were covered in blood" and stated that "suicide is a mystery, with many doubts."

　　蒋匪杀害于子三经过
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】据上海观察周刊三卷十一期报导：蒋匪逮捕屠杀浙大于子三烈士惨案经过称：十月二十五日，浙大农艺系四年级学生于子三，农经系四年级学生郦伯瑾，同往庆贺校友汪君新婚，供职于上海之道中女校之陈建新及蒋记农民银行之黄世民两校友，亦于是日乘车抵杭贺喜，彼等相遇后畅叙甚欢，至晚上十时许，于、郦拟返校时校车已开出，郦因久患脚病不便夜行，于亦须于翌晨出席浙大张故教育长追悼会，为方便计，遂同留宿于陈、黄两人在大同旅馆所赁房间。是晚深夜二时许，蒋匪军警于检查旅舍时，即无理将四人捕去，逮捕时既无拘票，更未说明原因。
    浙大学生自治会获悉后愤慨异常，二十七日即向蒋匪提出立即释放及保证以后不再发生类似事件两项正义要求，并分头向蒋匪当局交涉。蒋匪浙江省政府及保安司令，初时尚图抵赖，诿称“不知”，后经严重抗议后，始承认将四人均关在警察局狱中，并佯允于廿八日移送蒋匪法院，至二十八号又自食前言仍不移送。至此蒋匪敷衍搪塞真相已极明显。浙大全体学生遂决定：如二十九日晚蒋匪仍不释放四被捕同学，全校即于三十日起罢课。
    二十九日蒋匪保安司令部行凶后做贼心虚，曾无耻地压迫抱病在身的“竺校长签字证明他看见于君自杀”，但为竺氏拒绝。至此蒋匪杀害于烈士之奸计遂不得逞，而其罪责亦同时暴露无遗。当晚，于烈士被害恶耗传至浙大，全校即卷入反屠杀争自由罢课中，全体教授亦痛愤异常，与学生一致坚决主张：调查蒋匪杀害于子三烈士真相，控诉蒋匪浙江保安司令部蓄意谋杀罪行。
    蒋匪于行凶后，妄图诬指于子三烈士系“自杀身死”，但甚至与蒋匪官方有关之“观察”周刊亦不得不吞吞吐吐透露出惨案中的若干真相。该文指出于烈士死后“满头满面是血”，并谓“自杀是一个谜，有许多疑点”。
