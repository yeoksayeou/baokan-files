Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st. Comprehensive report: Since liberation three years ago, the trade union movements in the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe, with the support of the democratic governments of those countries, have developed into extremely powerful forces, becoming a real service to the working class and the main force in maintaining democracy and carrying out economic reconstruction. At present, trade union organizations have spread to all industries and are unified into a single central trade union organization in each country, with membership doubling compared to pre-war levels. According to recent statistics: Yugoslavia has 26 national trade unions, which together form the Yugoslav United Trade Union, with a total membership of 800,000. The Czech Republic has 21 industrial trade unions, all under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Czech United Trade Union, with 2 million members. Bulgaria has 32 national trade unions, which together form the Bulgarian General Trade Union, with 500,000 members. Poland has a total of 38 trade unions, all affiliated to the Central Executive Committee of the Polish Trade Union, with a total membership of 2.06 million. These trade unions are all democratically elected from the bottom up within various industrial sectors. However, three years ago, trade unions in Eastern European countries were still in a state of extreme disorganization or semi-organization. Most trade unions were compulsory official organizations, unrelated to each other, and filled with narrow guildism and mutual antagonism. For example, pre-war Poland had 343 isolated trade unions, and dozens of central trade union organizations; their activities only served the interests of the bourgeoisie. Today, the activities of trade unions in Eastern European countries play an important organizational role in the political and economic life of various countries. Yugoslavia's Five-Year Plan, Poland's Three-Year Plan, and the Czech and Bulgarian Two-Year Plans have been successfully developed under the enthusiastic support of trade unions and the full-scale patriotic emulation campaigns. Trade unions in various countries have also organized many mass movements. For example, in Bulgaria's "Cities Aid Villages Movement," trade unions organized 14,238 cultural labor teams, including 1.37 million workers, experts, doctors, veterinarians, tailors, lawyers, actors, and musicians, providing tens of thousands of services in rural areas. In the same movement in Yugoslavia, 77 labor teams were established in Belgrade alone, providing 470 services in rural areas and repairing 81,000 agricultural implements, establishing the unity and friendship between the working class and the peasantry. Trade unions in various countries are powerful pillars of democratic parties in parliamentary struggles at home, and abroad they are the backbone of the World Federation of Trade Unions, resolutely fighting to defend world peace. Trade unions in various countries are doing their best to improve the material life of workers. Various countries have established social insurance systems, paid vacation systems, maternity leave systems for pregnant female workers before and after childbirth, and equal pay for equal work systems. Trade unions also organize workers' canteens, sanatoriums, and rest homes. The Polish trade union has 454 medical centers with a total of 20,000 beds.

    东欧新民主主义国家
    职工运动飞跃发展
    成为维护民主的主力
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】综合报导：东欧各新民主主义国家的职工运动，在解放三年余以来，在各该国民主政府的支持下，已发展成为极其强大的力量，变成真正为工人阶级服务并维护民主与进行经济复用的主力。目前职工会组织已遍及各业，且统一于各该国单一的中央职工组织，会员均较战前增加一倍。据最近统计：南斯拉夫有全国性职工会二十六个，合组成南斯拉夫统一职工会，会员总数达八十万人。捷克有二十一个工业部门的职工会，都受捷克统一职工会中央委员会之领导，有会员二百万人。保加利亚全国有三十二个职工会，合组成保加利亚总工会，会员达五十万人。波兰共有职工会三十八个，均隶属于波兰职工会中央执行委员会，会员总数达二百零六万。此等工会均系在各产业部门内由自下而上之民主选举所产生。但在三年以前，东欧各国之职工尚在极散漫之无组织半组织状态中，职工会大多为具有强迫性之官方组织，彼此不相连系，且充满着狭隘的行会主义而互相对立。如战前波兰即有三百四十三个彼此隔绝之职工会，职工会中央组织达数十个之多；其活动仅为资产阶级之利益服务。今天东欧各国之职工会活动已在各国政治经济生活中起重要的组织者之作用。南斯拉夫五年计划，波兰三年计划，捷克与保加利亚之二年计划，即在职工会热烈拥护及全力展开爱国竞赛下得以顺利发展。各国职工会并组织许多群众运动，如在保加利亚之“城市援助乡村运动”中，职工会组织了文化劳动队达一万四千二百三十八个，包括工人、专家、医生、兽医、裁缝、律师、演员、音乐家一百三十七万人，下乡服务几万次。南斯拉夫在同一运动中，单在贝尔格莱德即成立劳动队七十七个，下乡服务四百七十次，修理农具八万一千个，确立国内工农阶级之团结友爱。各国职工会在国内均为民主党派在议会斗争中之强大支柱，在国外则为世界职工联盟之中坚，坚决为保卫世界和平而斗争。各国职工会均以大力从事改善工人的物质生活。各国均已确立社会保险制度，薪金照发之休假制度，怀妊女工在生产前后之休假制度，同工同酬制度等。职工会并组织工人食堂、疗养院、休养所等，波兰职工会即有医疗所四百五十四处，总床位达二万个。
