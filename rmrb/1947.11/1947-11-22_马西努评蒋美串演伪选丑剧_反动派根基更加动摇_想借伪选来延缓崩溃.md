Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 19th: Moscow Radio broadcast Masinu's commentary on the Kuomintang's sham election, scheduled for the 21st to the 23rd, on the 16th. The commentary pointed out that the purpose of this sham election is solely to further legitimize the Kuomintang's reactionary dictatorship and U.S. imperialist interference in China's internal affairs. It pointed out that the Kuomintang is preparing for this sham election according to the plan of the American butcher Wedemeyer. According to this plan, the election should be carried out under the suppression and persecution of democratic forces in the Kuomintang areas, treating the surviving democratic parties and groups in the Kuomintang areas with cruel means, arresting and massacring patriotic elements in large numbers, and extinguishing the patriotic movement in the Kuomintang areas. Therefore, thousands of patriotic and democratic elements and those who sympathize with democratic and independent ideas have been arrested or massacred, and even many Kuomintang political and military personnel have been arrested and shot on suspicion. But the Kuomintang has not become stronger as a result, but has become more fragile. The democratic camp has expanded even further, and even people who were previously outside the democratic struggle have joined the democratic movement against dictatorship, civil war, and American aggression. The Kuomintang reactionaries have felt that their foundation is even more shaken.

The commentary stated: The Kuomintang convened the first so-called "National Assembly for Constitution Making" last November, precisely when the Kuomintang army launched a general offensive against the liberated areas, but now this offensive has been bankrupted. No matter how hard the United States is working to provide the Kuomintang with huge assistance in all aspects, the Chinese civil war has now undergone a fundamental change in favor of the democratic forces. Since July and August this year, the People's Liberation Army has turned to a general counter-offensive. The election scheduled for the end of November, according to the original plan of the Kuomintang and the United States, should have been when they were celebrating their "victory" over the democratic forces, but now the Kuomintang reactionaries are not only unable to talk about any "victory," but they are also very fearful and uneasy. Everyone clearly sees the shaking of the reactionary foundation, while the democratic forces are growing and consolidating day by day. Now what the Kuomintang reactionaries are thinking about is not the so-called "one-shot defeat" of the democratic forces, but how to try their best to delay their own collapse.

The commentary emphasized: The Kuomintang government has now signed an agreement with the United States for the U.S. military to remain in China. They hope to rely on foreign bayonets to stage their own election farce under foreign protection and with the aid of money and weapons, in an attempt to maintain their regime. Therefore, the President of the Kuomintang government and other Kuomintang leaders have asked the United States to adopt the Greek experience in China. But the Greek experience just proves that even in a small country like Greece, the combined forces of British and American imperialists and the Greek royalist fascists have shown that they are not only unable to suppress and prevent the growth and consolidation of democratic forces, but also unable to prevent the expansion of democratic military forces. So in China, the Kuomintang reactionaries and the U.S. imperialists are even more unable to do this, because in China, a strong democratic camp has been formed, and the consolidated People's Liberation Army has developed into an invincible force.

　　马西努评蒋美串演伪选丑剧
  　反动派根基更加动摇
    想借伪选来延缓崩溃
    【新华社陕北十九日电】莫斯科电台十六日广播马西努关于即将于二十一日至二十三日举行的国民党伪选的评论，指出该伪选之目的，仅在于进一步使国民党反动独裁及美帝国主义干涉中国内政合法化。指出国民党系按照美国屠夫魏德迈的计划来准备此次伪选的，按照该计划，选举应该在对国民党地区民主力量摧残镇压的行动下进行，以残酷的手段对待国民党区残存的民主党派和团体，大批逮捕与屠杀爱国分子，扑灭国民党区的爱国运动。因此，千万爱国民主分子及对民主独立思想表同情的人被逮捕，或被屠杀，甚至许多国民党政治和军事人员亦以此种嫌疑被逮捕和枪杀。但是国民党并没有因此而变得坚强，反而更加脆弱了。民主阵营反更扩大，连以前站在民主斗争以外的人都加入了反独裁反内战反美国侵略的民主运动的队伍，国民党反动派已感觉到自己的根基更加动摇了。
    评论称：国民党去年十一月召开第一次所谓“制宪国大”，正是国民党军向解放区展开总进攻的时候，但现在这种进攻已遭到破产，不管美国是在怎样的努力在各方面给国民党以巨大援助，中国的内战现已发生了有利于民主力量的根本转变，今年七、八两个月以来人民解放军已转为总反攻。规定在十一月底举行的选举，按照国民党和美国原来的计划，应该是他们在“战胜”民主力量举行庆祝的时候，可是现时国民党反动派不仅谈不到什么“胜利”，而且他们已非常恐惧与不安，大家明显的看到反动派根基的动摇，民主力量则在日益增长和巩固。现在国民党反动派所想的已不是所谓“一举击败”民主力量，而是想怎样尽力延缓自己的崩溃。
    评论强调指出：国民党政府现在又和美国签订了美军留驻中国的协定，他们希望依靠外国的刺刀，在外国的保护以及金钱武器援助下扮演自己的选举滑稽剧，企图借以维持自己的政权，因此国民党政府行政院长和其他国民党首脑转请美国对华采用希腊的经验。但希腊的经验恰恰证明：甚至在希腊这样小的国家内，英美帝国主义者和希腊保皇党法西斯的联合力量，表现出不仅无力镇压与阻止民主力量的增长与巩固，且无力阻止民主军力量的扩大。那么在中国，国民党反动派和美帝国主义者，就更是做不到这一点，因为在中国，已经形成了强大的民主营垒，而已巩固了的人民解放军，已经发展成了攻无不克的力量。
