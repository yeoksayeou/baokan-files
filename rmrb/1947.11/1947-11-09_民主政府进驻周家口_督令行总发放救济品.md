Xinhua News Agency, Su-Lu-Yu-Wan Front, 5th: After the Liberation Army and the democratic government entered Zhoujiakou, a major town in eastern Henan, the masses successively accused the Third Working Team of the Henan Branch of the Chiang Kai-shek Executive Yuan Relief Administration, stationed in the area, of withholding relief supplies for half a year. These supplies were not distributed to the poor people in need, but were mostly given to the Chiang army, acting as a disguised granary and supply station for the Chiang bandit army under the guise of relief. A peddler and merchant, Geng Jifu, said: "When the traffic police came, they immediately opened the warehouse and carried things away, package after package, to send to them. The people from the Yellow River flooded area ran from afar, waiting for many days. Their travel expenses were used up, and they still might not receive anything." The democratic government immediately ordered the team to distribute the stockpiled relief goods to the poor people immediately. On the morning of October 26th, nearly ten thousand poor people, holding relief vouchers issued by the democratic government, went to the warehouse north of the village to receive relief supplies. However, the team leader, Hua Bomin, was not only slow and rude to the masses, but also only produced 84 sweaters, 97 boxes of biscuits, and 400 boxes of milk powder from the mountains of stockpiled materials to perfunctorily deal with them. Hua Bomin then used the excuse of overcrowding by the poor people to try to stop the distribution, and then issued low-quality sweet potato chips to delay the time, all of which were corrected by members of the democratic government. At that time, the Liberation Army was fiercely attacking the invading Chiang bandits, and the sound of artillery was deafening, but the tens of thousands of poor people remained extremely calm and received relief supplies in order.

Xinhua News Agency, E-Yu-Wan Front, 7th: The people of western Anhui and eastern Hubei are actively comforting the Liberation Army for their victory at Jieling and Gaoshanpu. The people of Taihu carried wine, more than forty fat pigs, and a large number of chickens, ducks, and fresh fish, led by a band, with drums and gongs resounding, and set off from the county government at dawn on the 4th to visit and comfort the army on the western Anhui front. The democratic government of Guangji County and all the liberated people of the county sent 10 million yuan to comfort the troops fighting in the county. They also attached a letter of thanks, saying: "You have protected us poor people, led us to fight the local tyrants, and won victories for the people, so that we can slowly stand up from now on."

    民主政府进驻周家口
    督令行总发放救济品
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线五日电】解放军与民主政府于进驻豫东重镇周家口后，群众即纷纷控诉驻该地蒋记行总河南分署第三工作队救济物资被扣压已达半年，未发与待救贫苦人民，而大半交与蒋军，名为救济实则为蒋匪军变相的粮库与兵站。摊贩商人耿继福说：交通警察来的时候，他们马上打开仓库把东西一包一箱的抬着送去，黄泛区老百姓远远跑来，一等就是多少天，盘费用光了，也不一定领到。民主政府当即督令该队将囤积的救济物资立即分于贫民。十月二十六日清晨近万余贫民持民主政府发给之救济帐票，前往寨北仓库领取救济物资。但该队队长华伯敏不仅对群众延慢粗暴，且只在堆积如山的大批物资中提出毛衣八十四件、饼干九十七箱、牛奶粉四百箱等借以搪塞。华伯敏复借口贫民拥挤，欲停止发放，后又发放品质低劣之洋芋干来拖延时间，均为民主政府人员纠正。当时适值解放军痛击来犯蒋匪，炮声隆隆，万余贫民仍极镇静，依次领取救济物资。
    【新华社鄂豫皖前线七日电】皖西鄂东人民纷纷慰劳在界领、高山铺获捷之解放军。太湖人民扛着酒，抬着四十多只肥猪和大批鸡鸭鲜鱼，以乐队为前导，鼓锣宣天，于四日拂晓由县府出发，前往皖西前线劳军。广济县民主政府和该县全体翻身人民，致送一千万元，慰劳在该县境作战之部队。并附感谢信说：“你们保护了我们穷人，带俺们打土豪，又为老百姓打胜仗，使俺们从此可以慢慢地出头了。”
