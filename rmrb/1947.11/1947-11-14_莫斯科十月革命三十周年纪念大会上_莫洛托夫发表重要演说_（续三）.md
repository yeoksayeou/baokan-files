　　In the Soviet Union, immediately after the war, a new Stalin Five-Year Plan was implemented. At the same time, we also need to draft plans for the next few five-year periods. We know that Comrade Stalin defined these new goals as follows: "As for plans for a longer period in the future, the Party's opinion is to organize a new and powerful upsurge in the national economy, so that we can increase industrial production, say, three times that of the pre-war period. We must achieve a situation where our industry must be able to produce 50 million tons of pig iron, 60 million tons of steel, 500 million tons of coal, and 60 million tons of oil every year."

　　This should be enough to show how the Soviet Union is concerned about consolidating lasting peace. All faithful friends of peace—who constitute the overwhelming majority in any country—can rest assured that the Soviet Union will adhere to the interests of universal peace to the end. In accordance with this peace policy, the Soviet Union adheres to the position of fully developing international cooperation. Comrade Stalin, in his conversation with the American celebrity Stassen, gave a thorough explanation of our foreign policy: "They—the Soviet Union and the United States—are certain that they can cooperate. The differences between them are not of great importance in terms of cooperation. The economic systems of Germany and the United States are similar, but war broke out between them. The economic systems of the United States and the Soviet Union are different, but they did not fight each other, and they cooperated during the war. If two different systems can cooperate during the war, why can't they cooperate in peacetime? It is completely understandable; as long as there is a desire for cooperation, cooperation is entirely possible even between different economic systems. When there is a lack of desire for cooperation, even with the same economic system, countries and nations will fight each other." The Soviet Union consistently pursues a policy of peace and international cooperation, and this is the attitude the Soviet Union takes towards all countries that express a desire for peace.

　　U.S. and British Imperialism Opposes Peaceful Cooperation and Pursues a Policy of Aggression, Arousing Opposition from People Around the World.

　　The policy put forward by Comrade Stalin is now being opposed by another policy—a policy based on completely different principles. Here, one should first mention the policies of the United States and the United Kingdom. There may indeed be plans in the United States regarding the national economic development of several periods in the future; however, although there are many press conferences in the United States, the press has never talked about it. On the other hand, various American plans, such as "Truman Doctrine" and "Marshall Plan," have caused a lot of confusion. When it comes to all these American plans to "aid Europe" and "aid China," etc., one would think that the domestic problems of the United States have long been resolved, leaving only the arrangement of other countries' affairs, requiring them to adopt its policies and form governments to its liking. In reality, it is not the case. If domestic problems in the United States, especially the imminent economic crisis, did not cause great anxiety among the American ruling class, there might not be so many expanded economic plans in the United States. These plans themselves are based on the aggressive military and political plans of American imperialism.

　　It is no longer a secret that the United States—sometimes in partnership with the United Kingdom—is constantly establishing naval and air force bases around the world, even adapting some entire countries for this purpose, especially countries close to Soviet territory. Who doesn't complain about the pressure of American imperialism in this regard now? If the governments of some major countries in Europe, Asia, and the Americas maintain a tolerable silence on this situation, then some small countries have obviously begun to find it absolutely unbearable.

　　For example, Denmark has tried every means to guarantee the restoration of its sovereignty over Greenland, because the United States is still unwilling to leave there after the end of the war. Egypt is reasonably demanding the withdrawal of British troops from its territory, but Britain refuses to do so, and the United States supports British imperialists on this issue.

　　However, it is obvious that the establishment of military bases around the world is not for defensive purposes, but to prepare for aggression. Another thing is also obvious: the Anglo-American Joint Military Staff established during World War II, if it is still preserved, is not motivated by peaceful intentions, but with the purpose of intimidating other countries with the prospect of new aggression.

　　It would be good if the American people knew all this, because under the so-called "Western" freedom of the press, when virtually every newspaper and radio station is in the hands of a handful of aggressive capitalists and their employed servants, it is difficult for the people to know the truth.

　　One Example of the Aggressive Policy of U.S. and British Imperialism: The Atomic Bomb Issue.

　　As is well known, a new religion is widely prevalent among American expansionists: since they have lost confidence in their own internal strength, they place their faith in the secret of the atomic bomb, although this secret has long ceased to be a secret. Imperialists seem to need this atomic bomb religion; and the atomic bomb, as everyone knows, is not a tool of defense, but a weapon of offense.

　　The fact that the United States and the United Kingdom prevented the United Nations from passing a final resolution banning atomic weapons has angered many people. British scientists have protested this matter twice this year, issuing statements on it twice. In the statements, they expressed dissatisfaction with Britain's pure endorsement of the United States in this regard. This is quite understandable, because the people of the United States and Britain are no less concerned than others about banning atomic weapons and universally reducing huge armaments. It should be recognized that the refusal to ban atomic weapons has greatly discredited the imperialists and mobilized all countries in the world and all faithful people against them.

　　Second Example of the Aggressive Policy of U.S. and British Imperialism: The Issue of Warmongers.

　　Or, take the issue of warmongers.

　　Regardless of all protests from the United States and other expansionists, the United Nations General Assembly, though reluctantly, still passed a resolution condemning the propaganda of new wars. However, the debate showed that the struggle against warmongers and their patrons must be intensified. They are carrying out the will of the profit-seeking top capitalists and millionaires who are holding aggressive intentions, and disregard the interests of their people.

　　We know that American industry expanded during the two world wars, although its development was extremely uneven, and production fell considerably below the 1913 level twice. On the other hand, during World War II, American industry expanded rapidly, beginning to give capitalists and the state extremely huge profits. American state-monopoly capitalism is now using it as a tool to exert pressure everywhere, in Europe and China, in Greece and Turkey, in South America and the Middle East.

　　Of course, there are many people who love wartime prosperity, but what benefit is this to the people? Needless to say, the interests of the people are fundamentally different from the interests of the instigators of a new world war. (To be continued)

　　莫斯科十月革命三十周年纪念大会上
    莫洛托夫发表重要演说　（续三）
    战争一结束，苏联就开始实行新的斯大林五年计划。同时，现在我们也还需要起草未来几个五年时期的计划。我们知道，斯大林同志确定这些新的目标如下：“至于未来较长时期的计划，党的意见是组织国民经济中新的、强大的蓬勃高潮，使我们增加工业生产，比如说，三倍于战前时期。我们必须达到这种情况，即我们的工业必须每年能出产铣铁五千万吨，钢六千万吨，煤五亿吨，石油六千万吨。”
    这应该足以表示：苏联是如何关心巩固而持久的和平。一切和平的忠实友人——他们在任何国家中都占有压倒的大多数——可以放心：苏联对于普遍和平底利益将坚持到底。依照这种和平政策，苏联坚守全面发展国际合作的立场。斯大林同志在他和美国名人史塔生的谈话中，对我们的外交政策曾作了透切的说明：“他们——苏联和美国——的确定是能够合作的。他们之间的差异，就合作来说，没有多大重要性。德国和美国的经济制度是类似的，然而，他们之间还是爆发了战争。美国和苏联的经济制度不同，但他们并未互相作战，而是在战时进行了合作。假如两种不同的制度能在战时合作，为什么他们在平时不能合作呢？完全可以理解；只要有了合作的愿望，即使在不同的经济制度之间，合作也是完全可能的。当缺乏合作的愿望时，即使有相同的经济制度，国家民族之间也会打起来。”苏联始终不渝地奉行和平与国际合作底政策，这就是苏联对一切表示愿望和平的国家所采取的态度。
    美英帝国主义反对和平合作，奉行侵略政策，激起了世界人民的反对。
    斯大林同志所提出的政策，现在正受到另一种政策——基于完全不同的原则的政策——的反对。在这里，人们首先应该提到美国和英国的政策。在美国也有可能的确存在着关于未来若干时期国家经济发展底计划，然而，虽然在美国，记者招待会倒很不少，但报界对此从来没有谈过。在另一方面，美国时而“杜鲁门主义”啦，时而“马歇尔计划”啦，各种各样的计划却引起了很多纷乱。谈到所有这些美国“援欧”“援华”等等计划时，人们就会想到，美国国内问题早已解决了吧，只剩下按排别国的事情，要他们采用它的政策，组成合它心意的政府了吧。实际上却并不如此。假如美国国内问题，特别是迫在眉睫的经济危机，没有引起美国统治阶层极大的不安，那也许就不会有那么多量美国扩大的经济计划。这些计划本身都是以美国帝国主义侵略性的军事与政治计划为基础的。
    现在对于这种事实已经不是什么秘密了；即美国——有时也同英国合伙——不停地在世界各地建立海军和空军基地，甚至把有些国家全国都适应于这种目的，特别是靠近苏联领土的国家。现在谁不抱怨美帝国主义在这方面的压力呢？如果说欧洲、亚洲和美洲某些大国的政府对这种情况保持还可以容忍的缄默的话，那末某些小国却显然已开始觉得绝对不可忍耐了。
    例如丹麦，想尽办法也不能保证恢复她对格林兰的主权，因为美国在战争结束以后，还不愿离开那里。埃及正合理地要求英军从该国领土撤退，但英国却拒绝这样做，而美国在这种问题上支持了英帝国主义者。
    可是，很明显的，在世界各地建立军事基地，并不是以防御为目的，而是准备侵略的。另一件事也很明显，就是在第二次世界大战时所建立的英美联合军事参谋部，如果仍然保存着，那它就不是从和平动机出发，而是抱着这样的目的，即以新侵略底远景恐吓别的国家。
    要是美国人民能知道所有这一切就好了，因为在所谓“西方”新闻自由之下，当实际上每一个报纸和广播电台都握在屈指可数的几个侵略性资本家，以及受他们雇用的奴仆手中的时候，人民是很难知道事实底真相的。
    美英帝国主义侵略政策实例之一：原子弹问题。
    如所周知，在美国扩张主义分子中间，正广泛流行着一种新的宗教：既然对他们自己内部的力量失去了信心，他们就把他们的信仰寄托于原子弹的秘密上，虽然这种秘密早已不成其为秘密了。帝国主义者似乎需要这种原子弹宗教；而原子弹，正如大家都知道的，并不是防御的工具，而是进攻的武器。
    美国和英国的阻止联合国通过禁用原子武器的最后决定，这一事实激怒了许多人，英国科学家今年曾两度抗议此事，他们曾两次发表对此的声明。在声明中，他们对于英国在这方面纯粹附和美国一点表示不满。这是十分可以理解的，因为美英两国人民之关心禁用原子武器以及普遍裁减庞大的军备，并不亚于他人。应当认清：拒绝禁用原子武器，已使帝国主义者大失体面，并使全世界一切国家，一切忠实的人民，起来反对他们。
    美英帝国主义侵略政策实例之二：战争贩子问题。
    或者，拿战争贩子问题来说吧。
    不管美国和其他扩张主义者一切抗议，联合国大会虽然勉强但仍然通过了谴责新战争宣传的决定。可是，在辩论中显示了必须加紧对战争贩子及其庇护者的斗争，他们是在举行着侵略的唯利是图的最上层资本家百万富翁的意旨，而漠视他们人民的利益。
    我们知道，在两次世界大战期间，美国工业是有扩展的，虽然他的发展极不平衡，生产量曾两度相当大的下降至一九一三年水平之下。而另一方面，在第二次世界大战期间，美国工业迅速地膨胀了，开始给资本家与国家收入以极巨的利润，美国的国家——独占资本主义现在正用之作为到处行使压力的工具，在欧洲和中国，在希腊和土耳其，在南美和中东。
    当然，也有许多人爱好战时景气，但是这对人民有什么利益呢？不消说，人民底利益与新的世界战争挑拨者底利益是根本不同的。（未完待续）
