　　Seven Counties in the Border Area of Northern Henan Overcome Chiang Kai-shek's Disaster
　　100,000 Mu of Wasteland Reclaimed in Two Months
[This newspaper's Taihang dispatch of the 12th] In the past two months of September and October, the work of reclaiming wasteland in the counties along the border of northern Henan has achieved great results, and most of it has been turned into wheat fields, which will play a significant role in making up for this year's poor harvest. These areas have suffered eight years of devastation by the Japanese invaders, especially in the past two years, the Kuomintang bandits' brutal plunder and oppression have left most of the land barren. According to statistics from the Fourth Administrative Office (overseeing seven counties and cities including Qinyang), there are 200,000 mu of wasteland. Wasteland in Anyang accounts for one-sixth of the entire cultivated area. In addition, this year's drought and hail have caused serious disasters. After our army liberated the area this summer, it immediately grasped the people's demands for food, land, and planting, and carried out relief, crash planting (autumn fields), crash harvesting (wheat), and struggles against traitors and local bullies, achieving great results. However, due to drought and the Kuomintang bandits' continued encroachment and plunder, the harvest is still poor. According to Anyang County's calculations, each person can receive eight dou of autumn grain this autumn. Based on a minimum living standard of one and a half sheng of grain per person per day, this is only enough to eat until early February of next year. If calculated at the current level of one sheng of grain per person per day, it is only enough to eat until the end of November this year. If all the wasteland in the county is completely eliminated and half of the county's land (300,000 mu) is planted with wheat, 150,000 shi can be harvested next summer. One and a half sheng of wheat per person per day is enough to eat for four months, just enough to connect with the autumn grain. This means that getting through this year is not a problem. To get through the lean months of next year, we must be determined to eliminate wasteland and expand wheat fields. In the past two months, through the leadership and assistance of the democratic government, and the organized and planned efforts of the masses, as of the middle of last month, according to incomplete statistics from seven counties including Anyang, Bo'ai, Qinyang, Xiuwu, Wenxian, Wuzhi, and Qi County, 104,000 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed, and most of it has been turned into wheat fields. The reasons for achieving such results are: (1) The leadership personally took action and specifically solved the difficulties of the masses in reclaiming wasteland and planting wheat. For example, on the 7th of last month, the Fourth Administrative Office issued reward measures for reclaiming wasteland and planting wheat, addressing the masses' concerns about lack of insurance and fear of bearing rent burdens, and enhancing their determination to reclaim wasteland. The Fourth and Fifth Administrative Offices' district-level agencies all organized wasteland reclamation and wheat planting shock teams, which went directly into the villages to organize and lead this work. Eight units, including the Fourth Administrative District Party Committee and Administrative Office, organized 56 comrades to go to the countryside on October 10 to carry out shock work and provide armed support for the masses' wasteland reclamation and wheat planting movement in the border areas. The Fifth Administrative Office organized more than 20 people and livestock to go to Shuiye in Anyang to reclaim wasteland. The Jinan Bank branch lent 20 million yuan to poor peasants and hired laborers to solve the difficulties of agricultural tools and livestock in the wasteland reclamation movement. The district trade company sold 600 shi of wheat to poor people at 20% lower than the market price to take care of the people's difficulties in planting wheat. Anyang, Wuzhi, Qinyang and other counties have borrowed a large amount of wheat seeds to the poor peasants, and carried out a large adjustment of labor at the county and district levels. Boai County, districts, and villages all established autumn harvest, wheat planting, and wasteland reclamation committees, with five departments under them: labor and animal power organization department, armed defense department, investigation and statistics department, agricultural tool and seed adjustment department, and propaganda and mobilization department. Special leadership of this work, the county's 50,000 acres of wasteland, the plan to plant last year's all planted, raw waste eliminated to 20% to 30%, November 15 to complete all wheat planting; (2) The masses under the slogan of "completely turn over by reclaiming wasteland, increase the strength to support the counter-offensive," carried out universal organization, emphasized voluntary combination and equivalent exchange in mutual assistance, unified planning, and carried out a warm wasteland reclamation and wheat planting campaign. For example, in the lower Shuimo Village of the second district of Boai, 527 male and female laborers, 408 of whom have participated in mutual assistance, emphasized voluntary combination and equivalent exchange in mutual assistance, most of them are booked by people, two people top one animal power, unified planning. Twenty-three animals in Houjiawa, Anyang, were organized to plow 520 mu of wasteland in the whole village in three days; 30 women in the village, led by Women's Federation Chairman Zhang Qiaozhi and Niu Wenxiu's military family member Shen Yongxiang, organized three pulling teams, a total of eight, planting 50 mu of wasteland wheat in one day. Nanguanzhuang in the fourth district of Wuzhi, after turning over and recovering 719 acres of land, most of which grew Artemisia, and the labor force was small, everyone felt the problem was serious, so the whole village carried out a large mobilization, mutual assistance, men and women all came out, three days of work will be the wasteland Artemisia all pulled out, the whole village 101 animals, organized 49 pairs, each pair plowing two acres of land per day, seven days that is plow finished. At the beginning of Xiaomozhuang, each pair of animals only plowed more than one acre, after reviewing the inequality of equivalence, it was stipulated that each pair of animals should plow three acres of land a day, and the democratic discussion of the living arrangements, since then a pair of animals plowed three acres of land a day. (3) Armed cover, mutual support between villages, is also a feature of this wasteland reclamation movement. For example, after the villages in the second district of Qinyang finished reclaiming wasteland, they mobilized 60 pairs of animals and 120 laborers to help Su Village, Yanzhuang Wucun, etc., and carried out a shock for three days, reclaiming over 1,000 mu of wasteland. The seventh district of Wuzhi border area was rushed to plant under armed cover, according to statistics from Macun and other three villages, nearly 2,000 mu of wasteland have been planted. On the 17th, 18th, and 19th of last month, Xiuwu, Qinyang and other counties held county-wide expansion meetings to summarize and arrange wasteland reclamation and wheat planting work. Xiuwu put forward the slogans: "Eliminating one mu of wasteland is equal to eliminating one enemy," and "Planting one more mu of wheat is one more point of victory." The third district proposed: "Strive for each person to fight to eliminate five mu of wasteland." The counties are still continuing to strike.

　　豫北边地七县战胜蒋灾
    两月灭荒十万余亩
    【本报太行十二日电】豫北边沿诸县九、十两月来灭荒工作获伟大成绩，且大部已变为麦田，对弥补今年歉收将起很大作用。这些地区经过日寇八年蹂躏，特别近二年来，蒋匪的残酷掠夺压榨，土地大部荒芜。据四专署（辖沁阳等七个县市）统计，即有荒地二十万亩。安阳荒地占整个耕地面积六分之一。再加今年旱雹造成严重的灾荒。今年夏季我军解放该区后，当即抓住群众吃饭、要地、种地的要求，进行了救济，抢种（秋田）抢收（麦子）与反奸霸的斗争，取得了很大成绩。但因天旱与蒋匪的继续蚕食掠夺，收成仍差；安阳全县计算：今年秋天每人可收到八斗秋粮，按最低生活一人一天半升谷，只能吃到明年二月初，若按现在一人一天一升谷的水平，只能吃到今年十一月底。如果把全县荒地全部消灭完，全县要种一半土地的麦子（三十万亩）明夏可收十五万石，一人一天半升麦，才能够四个月吃，刚接上秋粮。这就是说度过今年，是不成问题了，要想度过明年的青黄不接时期，就得下决心消灭荒地，扩大麦田。两月来经民主政府领导与帮助，及群众有组织有计划的突击，截至上月中旬止。据安阳、博爱、沁阳，修武、温县、武陟、淇县等七个县的不完全统计：已灭荒地十万零四千亩，且大部变为麦田。获得如此成绩的原因：（一）是领导上的亲自动手，与具体的解决了群众的灭荒种麦困难。如四专署在上月七日，曾颁布了灭荒种麦的奖励办法，解决了群众的怕不保险，怕负担出租子等思想顾虑，增强了灭荒决心。四、五各专署区级各机关，均组织有灭荒种麦突击队，直接深入村里，组织领导这一工作，四专区地委、专署等八个单位，组织了五十六个同志，十月十日下乡突击，并以武装支援边地群众灭荒种麦运动。五专署组织二十多人员和畜力，到安阳水冶灭荒。冀南银行分行在灭荒运动中，贷给贫雇群众两千万元，以解决农具，畜力的困难；分区贸易公司，为照顾群众的种麦困难，以六百石麦子比市价低二成，卖给贫苦群众。安阳、武陟、沁阳等县，均给贫雇群众借贷了大量麦种，并进行了县、区劳力大调剂。博爱县、区、村均成立有秋收、种麦、灭荒委员会，下设劳畜力组织部、武装保卫部、调查统计部、农具种籽调剂部、宣传鼓动部等五部。专门领导这一工作，全县五万亩荒地，计划去年种过的全部种上，生荒消灭到百分之二十到三十，十一月十五日完成全部种麦；（二）群众在“灭荒彻底翻身，增加支援反攻力量”的口号下，进行了普遍的组织起来，在互助中强调了自愿结合及等价交换，统一计划，开展了热烈的灭荒种麦运动。如博爱二区下水磨村男女劳力五百二十七个，参加互助的现已有四百零八个，在互助中强调了自愿结合及等价交换，大部是以人订分，二人顶一畜力，统一计划。安阳侯家洼二十三头牲口组织起来，三天犁完全村五百二十亩荒地；该村妇女三十人，在妇女主席张巧只、牛文秀军属申永祥带领下，组织了三个拉耧队，共八张，一天种荒地麦五十亩。武陟四区南官庄，经过翻身收回七百一十九亩地，大部长了蒿草，劳力又少，大家感到问题严重，于是全村便进行了大动员、大互助、男女一齐出动，三天功夫即把荒地蒿草全部拔完，全村一百零一头牲口，组织了四十九犋，每犋每天犁地二亩，七天即犁完了。小磨庄开始每犋牲口只犁一亩多，经过检讨等价不公，规定一犋牲口一天三升料，生活按排由民主讨论，从此一犋牲口一天犁地增至三亩。（三）武装掩护，村与村的互相支援，亦是此次灭荒运动中的特点。如沁阳二区后边村庄灭完荒后，调集牲口六十犋，劳力一百二十个，到苏庄、阎庄武村等帮助突击三天，灭荒×千余亩。武陟边地七区由武装掩护抢种，据马村等三村统计，已灭荒种麦近两千亩。上月十七、八、九号，修武、沁阳等县开全县扩干会，总结与布置了灭荒种麦工作，修武提出：消灭一亩荒地，等于消灭一个敌人”，“多种一亩麦，多一分胜利”等口号，三区则提出：“争取每人要为消灭五亩荒地而斗争”。现各县仍在继续突击中。
