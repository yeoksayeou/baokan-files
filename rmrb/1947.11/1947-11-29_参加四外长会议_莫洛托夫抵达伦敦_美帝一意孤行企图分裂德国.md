　　To Attend the Four Foreign Ministers Conference
    Molotov Arrives in London
  　U.S. Imperialism Obstinately Attempts to Split Germany
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th】Comprehensive report: As the political and economic crisis in Western Europe intensifies, the Four Foreign Ministers Conference of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, to discuss the German and Austrian peace treaties, is scheduled to open in London today. Delegations from the Soviet Union, the United States, and France have arrived in England one after another. Molotov arrived in London on the 23rd. Although discussions have not yet begun, various facts indicate that the U.S. and British imperialist bloc has resolved to undermine the Potsdam and Yalta Conference agreements on the German and Austrian questions, which will fill the conference with numerous difficulties. The four foreign ministers' assistants' conference, held for more than two weeks from the 6th to the 22nd for preliminary exchanges of views, failed to reach any agreement. Even the agenda for the foreign ministers' conference was not decided because the U.S. and Britain insisted on discussing the Austrian peace treaty first. Before leaving for the conference, Marshall delivered a speech in Chicago on the 19th, in which he greatly vilified the Soviet Union and made clear his intention to stubbornly split Germany. He falsely claimed that the U.S. support for German fascists to invade Europe "clearly coincides with European interests." He blatantly stated that "without the restoration of German production, the European economy cannot be restored." He even openly advocated turning Germany into a divided "German federation." In his speech, he also unreservedly admitted that "since the summer of 1945, the U.S. government's goals and the attitude of most American newspapers have indeed been hostile to the Soviet Union." But he blamed this on "Soviet provocation." His determination to enslave Europe remains unshaken; he wants to "rebuild pre-war Europe." Dulles' recent reactionary remarks on the German question were also full of calls to tear up the Potsdam and Yalta agreements, and were enthusiastically promoted by reactionary British and American newspapers. Shouts such as "partial solution to the German question," "merger of the British and American occupation zones," and "abandoning the Soviet Union on the German question" are constantly being heard. The Soviet newspaper "Izvestia" pointed out on the 20th that the U.S. and British conspiracy on the German question has become increasingly blatant, directly opposing the establishment of a democratic and unified Germany, and attempting to organize a puppet government in western Germany and conclude a separate peace treaty with it, as a powerful base for imperialist warmongers to carry out expansion and aggression.
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th】Berlin Dispatch: German youth oppose the U.S. imperialist plot to split Germany. The "Free German Youth" organization recently sent a telegram to world youth, signed by over a million German youths, urging the London Foreign Ministers Conference not to split Germany, and exposing the war-mongers' aim to divide Germany. The Communist Party of the Hamburg district (British occupation zone) passed a resolution demanding that representatives of all German political parties, trade unions, and workers' organizations participate in the Foreign Ministers Conference.

　　参加四外长会议
    莫洛托夫抵达伦敦
  　美帝一意孤行企图分裂德国
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】综合报导：正当西欧政治经济危机紧张之时，讨论德奥和约的苏美英法四外长会议，定今日在伦敦开幕。苏美法三国代表团已先后至英，莫洛托夫系在廿三日抵伦敦。讨论虽尚未开始，但种种事实说明美英帝国主义集团已决心破坏波茨顿与雅尔塔会议关于德奥问题的协定，由此将使会议充满重重困难。事先交换意见的四外长助理会议，自六日至廿二日开会两周余，没有获得任何协议，甚至对外长会议的程序，亦因美英坚持先讨论奥国和约而未决定。马歇尔在启程赴会前，于十九日在芝加哥发表演说，竟大肆诋毁苏联，并表明其一意孤行分裂德国的意图。他妄谓美国扶植德国法西斯用以侵略欧洲的行动，“显然和欧洲利益不谋而合。”并露骨表示“没有德国生产的恢复，就不能恢复欧洲的经济。”甚至公然主张把德国造成一个分裂的“德国联邦”。在该演说中，他又毫不隐讳的承认“自一九四五年夏季以来，美国政府的目标和大部分美国报纸的态度，确确实实是仇视苏联的。”但把责任诿之于“苏联挑衅。”他对欧洲的奴役坚决不移，他要“重建战前的欧洲。”杜勒斯最近关于德国问题的反动谈话，也充满了撕毁波茨顿和雅尔塔协定的叫嚣，并为英美的反动报纸所热心宣传。“对德部分解决”，“英美法占领区合并”，“在德国问题上抛弃苏联”等叫嚣亦不断传来。苏联消息报于二十日指出：美英对德问题的阴谋，已经愈来愈露骨，直言无讳的反对建立民主统一的德国，力图在西部德国组织傀儡政府并与之单独缔结和约，以作为帝国主义好战分子进行扩张侵略的强有力据点。
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】柏林讯：德国青年反对美帝国主义企图分裂德国的阴谋。“自由德国青年”团体顷致电世界青年，该电由百余万德国青年签名，敦促伦敦外长会不要使德国分裂，并揭露战争贩子的目的是要分裂德国。汉堡区（英占区）共产党集会通过决议，要求外长会议有全德各政党、职工会及工人团体的代表参加。
