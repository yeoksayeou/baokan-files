　　Farmers in Central Jiangsu who have stood up are launching a movement to eliminate Chiang, seek revenge, defend their homes, and join the army. Last month alone, in six counties including Dongtai, Taipei (newly established county), Xinghua, Qintong (newly established county), Shiying, and Zishi (newly established county), more than 15,000 people enlisted. In the Central Jiangsu Liberated Area, over the past year, under the "encirclement and suppression" and "mopping-up" operations of Chiang's bandits, more than 30,000 civilian houses were burned and more than 20,000 people were killed. Millions of people have forged a blood feud with Chiang's bandits. When the good news of the great counter-offensive came, the people were eager to eliminate Chiang and seek revenge, and they enthusiastically joined the army. Lian Da-ying from Dongtai, at the county cadre expansion meeting, accused the Chiang Kai-shek's "Home Return Corps" of brutally killing her husband, Lian Bao-huan, and said: "My man will not rest in peace even in death. Before he died in prison, he secretly wrote the names of the seven people who harmed him on a piece of paper and asked someone to bring it to me, asking me and my comrades to avenge him. Now the day of revenge has come!" Immediately, twenty-three cadres scrambled to sign up for the army. The honored soldier Chen Zhen-hai also requested to return to the front line. Thirty-five township cadres from the Zishi County Township Cadre Training Class also enlisted, and collectively wrote to the county head, saying: "None of us one hundred and eighty-six poor brothers has not suffered at the hands of the landlords and Chiang's bandits. Li Xing-yi was forced to beg for food, and once grabbed a handful from the landlord's dog food bowl and was hung up and beaten unconscious three or four times. Today we want to avenge this thousand-year-old grievance!" Currently, many townships have established counter-offensive companies, and villages have established counter-offensive platoons. In Waozao Village, Caoqu District, Dongtai alone, more than seventy people have enlisted. Good stories of joining the army are spreading everywhere. Chen Huai-zhu, an old military family member in Taipei, sent his eldest son, second son, and third son to the army in succession last year and the year before last. This time, he personally sent his fourth and fifth sons to the army. Zhang Cheng-lin, a farmer who stood up in Diao Feng Township, Qintong, joined the army hand in hand with his son. In addition to mobilizing twenty-eight people to enlist in his village, Shen Fu-lan, a hero in joining the army from Xinghua, also led one hundred and thirty strong men from the entire township to enlist. The new recruits are full of confidence in victory, and everywhere they form teams and shout: "Fight Dongtai, take Xinghua, Nanjing and Shanghai will fall together, we will not return home until Chiang is eliminated."
