Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th – Chiang Kai-shek clique's wealthy and powerful figures in Taiwan, Suiyuan and elsewhere are using their influence to monopolize the "National Assembly" sham elections, engaging in open and covert struggles, revealing their ugly state. An October 8th dispatch from Taiwan in the Tianjin Minguo Daily stated: The total number of seats predetermined by the Chiang clique in Taiwan is no more than one hundred, yet each of the seventeen counties in the province has twenty to thirty participants "competing" in the election, all of whom are "prominent figures," "bureaucrats," and "powerful tycoons." Each of them has established their own "election campaign office," spending money to hire people as campaign henchmen and using money to buy votes. When promoting their "election resumes," some even brought out the signboard of "formerly the manager of the Beijing branch of Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan," and a wealthy son of someone "competing" for a "Legislator" even falsely claimed to be "a graduate of a certain law department of a Japanese university." The Taiwan dispatch stated: The people of Taiwan "are not interested" in this kind of sham election and predict that "two-thirds of the voters will abstain." Furthermore, according to the Tianjin Yishibao on October 15th: Suiyuan, like elsewhere, has also started so-called "election fever." The heads of the Baojia system are now eating high on the hog; the fake "ballots" are in their hands. You invite them, and I invite them; they can't finish eating in a day. In the past, these Baojia heads couldn't even dream of asking for help from the "officials," but now they are actually inviting them. The most amusing thing is in Gui Sui (present-day Hohhot). Those with power in Gui Sui were competing for the "National Assembly," engaging in infighting all day long, seeking connections, canvassing votes, and hosting banquets, making a fuss for dozens of days. As a result, the Suiyuan provincial government suddenly received a notice from the Chiang bandit Executive Yuan stating that Gui Sui City (i.e., Gui Sui) did not have any "National Assembly" seats. This was like a bucket of cold water on those with "election fever," leaving them looking ashen. They immediately telegraphed the Executive Yuan, requesting a supplement and complaining that the provincial government "didn't report it earlier, ruining the National Assembly." The newspaper had actually published it a long time ago, but these "competing" gentlemen are not in the habit of reading the newspaper, resulting in a situation of both laughter and tears.

    蒋党扮演“国代”伪选
    贿赂请客到处出丑
    【新华社陕北五日电】台湾、绥远等地蒋党豪门权贵，正各使势力，垄断“国代”伪选，明争暗斗，丑态毕露。十月八日天津民国日报台湾通讯称：台湾蒋党御定名额总数不过百名，而全省十七县，每县参加“竞”选者皆达二三十名，全部为“显贵”“官僚”和“有势力的富豪”。他们每人都成立了自己的“竞选事务所”，化钱雇人，充当竞选爪牙，拿钱收买选票。宣扬自己“竞选履历”的时候，有人竟把“曾任日本三菱公司北京支店长”的招牌拿出，某竞选“立委”的富绅子弟甚至冒充“系日本某大学法学系毕业”。该台湾通讯称：台湾人民对此种伪选“皆不感兴趣”，并预料将“有三分之二选民弃权”。另据十月十五日天津益世报载：绥远也同别处一样开着所谓“竞选热”，保甲长，现在更吃开了，伪“选票”握在手里，你也请，我也请，一天吃不清，平素这批保甲长连想去求助也不得的“官儿们”，居然也请起他们来了。最有趣的是归绥，归绥有势力者为“国代”竞选，勾心角斗，忙乱终日，找关系，拉票，请客，整闹了几十天，结果绥远省府突接蒋匪行政院通知说：绥远市（即归绥）没有“国大”名额，这对有“竞选热”的人不啻一瓢冷水，一脸灰气，连忙向行政院打通电，要求增补，埋怨省府“为什么不早报，把个国大弄吹了”。报纸其实早已刊登过，不过这些“竞选”老爷习惯不看报，结果闹得哭笑不得。
