　　Xiuwu News from this Newspaper: Comrade Qiao Zhensheng, the banner of borderland struggle in the Second District, and militiamen Li Jinghua and Guo Yulu from Hanshan Village along the mountain, led the Second District militia work team to Dongbanqiao on the morning of the 11th of this month. Half a mile from the village, they encountered the enemy. The enemy charged three times but were repelled by our brave militiamen. Qiao Zhensheng, the brave militia captain of Daguanzhuang Village, fought bravely and was wounded twenty paces from the enemy, but he did not retreat and continued to fight the enemy for half an hour, killing two and wounding four. Comrade Zhensheng was wounded a second time and gloriously sacrificed his life. Militiamen Li Jinghua and Guo Yulu also gloriously sacrificed their lives after being shot more than ten paces from the enemy.

　　Comrade Qiao Zhensheng, 22 years old, led small armed groups to frequently appear behind enemy lines in Banqiao and Wuliyuan to strike at the enemy and puppets during the enemy's offensive last year. He always stood at the forefront of the struggle against the enemy and was deeply loved by the masses, becoming the banner of struggle in the border area of Xiuwu. When the bad news came, the people of the entire county were extremely saddened and indignant. The militiamen and masses of the Second District held a special meeting that day to mourn and unanimously shouted: "Kill more enemies to avenge the three martyred heroes!" All agencies sent elegiac couplets, and the county government sent letters of condolence to the families of the martyred heroes, and allocated 200 catties of millet to each family for relief. Now the entire county has been swept into the three major movements of capture, explosion, and political offensive, vowing to avenge the martyred heroes. (Xiuwu Joint Office, Lian Qiangguo)

　　修武二区群众悲愤集会
    追悼民兵三烈士
    【本报修武讯】二区边地斗争旗帜乔振声同志和沿山韩庄民兵李京华、郭玉禄三同志，于本月十一日晨带二区民兵工作队向东板桥方向活动，离村半里地与敌遭遇，敌连冲三次，都被我英勇民兵击退。大官庄民兵队长乔振声同志勇敢杀敌，离敌二十余步挂了彩，但仍不后退，又坚持与敌打了半点钟，毙敌二名，伤敌四名，振声同志二次挂彩光荣牺牲。民兵李京华、郭玉禄二同志，亦在离敌十多步处中弹光荣牺牲。
    乔振声同志，现年二十二岁，去年敌人进攻时，即带领小股武装时常出没敌后板桥、五里源一带，打击敌伪，始终站在与敌斗争的最前线，深得群众爱戴，成了修武边地斗争旗帜。噩耗传来，全县人民悲愤异常，二区民兵群众，特于当日召开大会进行追悼，一致高喊：“多杀几个敌人，为三位死难烈士报仇！”各机关皆送有挽联，县府特致书慰问死难烈士家属，并各拨小米二百斤，予以抚恤。现全县已卷入轰轰烈烈的捕捉、爆炸、政攻三大运动，誓为死难烈士复仇。（修武联合办公室、连强国）
