    Taihang Third District: Many Villages Complete Autumn Plowing
    Why is it Faster Than in Previous Years?
    1. Early Start, No Break in Momentum
    2. People Replace Livestock on the Land
    3. Non-Stop, Day and Night Blitz

    [Report from our Taihang office on the 7th] The autumn plowing campaign in the Taihang Third District has recently reached a climax, with some areas having already successfully completed it. For example, one-fifth of the villages in Licheng (over 30 villages) have completed autumn plowing and transitioned to winter production. In Pingshun, most villages have completed the first plowing, and are now engaged in a concentrated effort on the second plowing. In Xiqingbei, the second plowing covers six-tenths of the autumn land. Statistics from the Xihuo and Sudian sub-districts of Changzhi show that two-thirds to five-sixths of the autumn land has been completed, totaling more than 24,000 mu. In Huguan, approximately half of the autumn land has been plowed, and in the first, second, and fourth districts of Lucheng, an average of more than one-third of the land has been turned. The basic characteristic of this year's autumn plowing campaign in the district is a "seize-the-day blitz," making the autumn plowing much faster than in previous years. Generally, it used to take a month or twenty days, but this year it only took a little over half a month or ten days. The methods are threefold: (1) Early start, no break in momentum. During the autumn harvest, livestock were squeezed out and specialized personnel were assigned to plow the land. The masses called this "wind and snow coming together." For example, in the fifth district of Pingshun, combined with autumn sowing of wheat, about half of the land was plowed for the first time, and the Nanzhuanggou sub-district plowed two-thirds. This broke the old traditions of "resting and plowing slowly" and "engaging in transportation during autumn plowing." (2) Everyone on the land, human power replacing animal power. In particular, women and auxiliary labor broke the past habit of "men plowing the land and women spinning cotton," and mostly participated in autumn plowing. In Xihuo, Changzhi, 80% of the masses participated in autumn plowing, half of whom were women and auxiliary labor. Lucheng City plowed more than 450 mu of land a day, of which human digging accounted for 210 mu, and women digging accounted for 85 mu of the human digging. Generally, human plowing and digging accounted for one-fifth to half of the entire plowing. (3) Non-stop, a concentrated effort. The key point of Dongyangguan in Licheng put forward the slogan "Three early efforts equal one work day." Male and female laborers started early and worked late, completing 450 work days in nine days, and livestock completed 560 work days. Xizhuang Village in Changzhi dug 1,000 mu of land in two days and two nights, of which night digging accounted for one-fifth, and 57 women participated. Chen Yuhai's group did not sleep all night, and twelve people dug nine and a half mu of land. Shenjiaping in Pingshun specially organized a blitz team of 46 people with poor and hired peasants as the backbone, and led by the village production committee's blitz team. They reinforced wherever the work was most demanding. The district is now conducting checks area by area, district by district, and village by village, and has begun mutual assistance between groups and villages to strive for a balanced autumn plowing. For example, in Xihuo, Changzhi, Wang Feize's brigade exchanged labor with other groups to dig more than 70 mu of land. Huoxiangdao in Licheng finished plowing on the 22nd, and on the 24th organized 21 teams of livestock to support Changning Village in plowing the land.

    太行三专不少村完成秋耕
    为什么比往年快？
    一、着手早，不换气
    二、人顶牲口齐上地
    三、不分昼夜的突击
    【本报太行七日电】太行三专区最近秋耕运动进入高潮，部分地区已胜利完成秋耕。如黎城五分之一村庄（三十余村）已完成秋耕转上冬季生产；平顺绝大部分村庄已完成犁一遍，现正突击二犁，西青北二犁，占秋地的十分之六；长治西火、苏店两个小区统计，已完成秋耕地三分之二到六分之五，共计两万四千余亩；壶关秋耕地已达一半左右，潞城一、二、四区平均完成秋垡地三分之一以上。该区今年秋耕运动的基本特点，是“抢天突击”，因此秋耕较往年快的多，一般过去得一月或二十天，今年只用半月多或十来天。其做法有三个：（一）着手早，不换气。在秋收运动中便挤出牲口，抽出专人犁地，群众叫这是“风搅雪一齐来”。如平顺五区结合秋耕种麦，就有一半左右的地垡了头遍，南庄沟小区犁了三分之二。打破了历来“歇歇慢慢耕”和“秋耕中还要搞运输”的旧传统。（二）一齐上地，人力顶畜力。特别是妇女、辅助劳力，打破了过去“男垡地，女纺花”的习惯，大部参加秋耕。长治西火百分之八十的群众参加了秋耕，其中一半是妇女与辅助劳力。潞城城里一天耕地四百五十余亩，其中人掘地占二百一十亩，人掘地中妇女掘的又占八十五亩，一般人犁、人掘地，占整个耕地的五分之一到一半。（三）不分昼夜，一股劲突击。黎城东阳关基点提出：“三早顶一工”的口号，男女劳力起早搭黑，九天赶工四百五十个，畜力赶工五百六十个，长治西庄村两天两夜共掘地一千亩，其中夜掘地占五分之一，并有五十七个妇女参加，陈玉孩组一夜没睡，十二人掘地九亩半。平顺申家坪特组织了以贫雇为骨干的四十六人的突击队，并由村生委会突击股领导，那里活紧张到那里突击。现该专区正进行区、村挨片检查，并开始了组与组、村与村的变工支援，以争取秋耕平衡。如长治西火王肥则大队组与组变工掘地七十余亩。黎城火巷道二十二日耕完，二十四日就组织了二十一犋牲口，支援长凝村垡地。
