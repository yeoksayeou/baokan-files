　　Masses Research Many Methods
　　Jiaozuo Villages Store Grain in Preparation for War
　　[This newspaper's Jiaozuo dispatch] The masses in the urban area are now carrying out a crash program of grain storage in preparation for war, to strike at the enemy's looting of grain. The autumn harvest and wheat planting have been completed, and most villages have expanded their wheat fields. For example, in Hekou and Liuzhuang villages, the average person has planted four mu of wheat, and Liuzhuang has reclaimed forty mu of wasteland. In order to vigorously promote grain storage, District One recently held a meeting of district cadres, researched and developed several methods and experiences for the crash grain storage program: First, break down the ideological concerns of the masses. At the beginning, the masses had the following ideological concerns: (1) fear of moisture, that the stored grain would spoil; (2) groundwater, making it impossible to bury the grain. However, after discussion, it was decided that it was too close to the enemy, and it was necessary to store the grain. After research by the village cadres and the masses, many methods were found, at least fourteen kinds, such as on-site burial, remote dispersion, storing with relatives, some villages storing together in mutual aid. All the grain is first stored, then dug out, one place is dried and then stored in another place. Some villages spread the storage in several places, eating from one place and then another, to avoid exposure and save labor. Second, strictly control landlords to prevent them from exposing the stored grain. For example, in Nan Zhang, the objects of struggle are sent to other villages for management, mostly guarded by militiamen, collectively reclaiming wasteland, so the masses are more at ease with storing grain. Third, grain storage is also a major support for mutual aid and storage. Fourth, the leadership must firmly grasp the emulation of merit. The leadership of District One put forward the slogan: "Store grain quickly and thoroughly!" and decided: (1) Distribute the fruits of struggle that have not yet been divided to meet the needs of the poor and hired peasants. (2) Concentrate all forces to complete the crash storage of grain. (3) Be quick and thorough. For example, in Hekou, District Two, Cheng Guiying and Liu Guiying competed in carrying. Liu Guiying originally carried sixty jin, but this time she carried seventy jin. Cheng Guiying originally carried seventy-two jin, but this time she carried ninety-nine jin. Children also participated in the competition. Zhao Shiyi increased from carrying fifty jin to seventy-five jin. Women and children in all villages participated in the competition to establish merit.

　　群众研究办法很多
  　焦作各村藏粮备战
    【本报焦作讯】市区群众现正在突击藏粮备战，打击敌人抢粮。秋收种麦已完成，大多数村庄都扩大了麦田，如河口、刘庄村，每人平均种麦四亩，刘庄开荒地四十亩。一区为了大力开展藏粮，于最近召开了区干部会，研究出突击藏粮几点办法与经验：一、打破群众思想顾虑。开始，群众思想上存在着：（一）怕湿，藏起坏了；（二）地下有水，没法埋藏。但一讨论，离敌太近，非藏不行。经各村干部群众研究，办法很多，至少有十四种，如就地埋藏，远处分散，找亲戚关系存放，有的村互助伙藏，先全部藏好，然后再挖出，一处晒一处藏，有的村分散藏几个地方，食时吃完一处再吃一处，免暴露，又省工。二、严管地主，防止暴露藏粮。如南张把斗争对象送外村管理，大多是民兵看守，集体开荒，群众才放心藏。三、藏粮也是大支援互助藏。四、领导上要抓紧立功竞赛。一区领导上提出口号：“藏粮要快，要净！”并决定：（一）斗争果实未分的马上分，满足贫雇要求。（二）集中一切力量，突击藏完粮。（三）要快要净，如二区河口程贵英与刘贵英竞赛担运，刘贵英原担六十斤，这回担七十斤，程贵英原担七十二斤，这回担九十九斤。儿童也参加比赛，赵石义由担五十斤增到七十五斤。各村妇女儿童都参加了竞赛立功。（志鹏）
