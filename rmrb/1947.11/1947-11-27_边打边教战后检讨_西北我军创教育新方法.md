Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 25th: "Teach while doing before battle, teach while fighting during battle, review actions after battle" is a new method employed by a certain unit of the Northwest People's Liberation Army for training new recruits through "soldier teaching soldier." For example, when the unit discovered enemy aircraft during a march, squad leader Sang Wenzhi immediately taught the new soldiers how to scatter and lie prone in concealed positions. During exercises, new and veteran soldiers acted together, with the veteran soldiers demonstrating and explaining during assaults, explosions, climbing ladders, and scaling city walls, passing on their methods and experiences to the new recruits. During the recent battle to capture Yulin Airport, Wan Yide, the leader of a "linkage group" in a certain company, specifically guided the two new soldiers he was leading in throwing hand grenades as they approached the enemy, causing sudden casualties to the enemy at Sanchawan. When crossing the open area of the airport, he led and taught the new soldiers how to avoid enemy machine gun fire, resulting in a complete and victorious crossing of the open area. In this battle, none of the veteran soldiers of a certain detachment were injured, but some of the new recruits were wounded. A review was conducted after the battle, with the veteran soldiers commenting on the various actions of the new soldiers and specifically explaining tactics and techniques. At the same time, veteran soldiers and veteran cadres used their own experiences as new recruits to empathize with, encourage, and educate the new soldiers, in order to break their inevitable fear of initial combat and further enhance their enthusiasm for killing the enemy.

　　边打边教战后检讨
  　西北我军创教育新方法
    【新华社西北二十五日电】“战前边作边教，战时边打边教，战后检讨动作”。是西北解放军某部“兵教兵”训练新战士的新方法。如该部在行军中发现敌机，班长桑文治即教新战士散开俯卧式工事隐蔽。在演习中新老战士一起动作，老战士在攻坚、爆炸、爬梯、爬城中边作边讲，将自己的方法和经验教给新战士。最近攻克榆林飞机场战斗中，某班“连手组”长万一德于接近敌人时，具体指导他带的两个新战士打手榴弹，在三岔湾予敌突然杀伤。在通过飞机场开阔地时，他带领并教给新战士避开敌人的机枪扫射，结果全部胜利越过开阔地。是役某支队老战士没一个负伤而新战士却有的挂了彩，战后即进行检讨，由老战士评论新战士的各种动作并具体讲解战术技术。同时老战士和老干部并以自己当新战士的经历，从心里去体贴、鼓励、教育新战士，以打破其初次作战难免的恐惧心理，并更加提高其杀敌热情。
