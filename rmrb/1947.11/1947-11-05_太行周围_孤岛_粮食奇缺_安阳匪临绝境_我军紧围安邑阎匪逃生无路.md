[This dispatch from Ji-Lu-Yu (Hebei-Shandong-Henan) on the 3rd of this month] According to merchants who escaped from Anyang, the Chiang bandits in Anyang are facing a desperate situation, lamenting the danger of a second Yongnian. Since our army recovered Yongnian and annihilated the pseudo-bandit Xu Tieying's troops, extreme panic and chaos have gripped Anyang. Prices have soared in recent days. Flour now sells for 8,000 yuan per catty, steamed buns for 10,000 yuan, sesame oil for 40,000 yuan, and firewood for 30,000 yuan per eight catties. Daily necessities rely solely on three or four planes from the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, which shuttle back and forth two or three times a day for transportation. The soldiers and staff universally and dramatically exhibit pessimistic and war-weary sentiments. Drunken brawls, chaotic quarrels, and curses are everywhere. As a result, these words have become even more popular: "This place doesn't support me, there's another place that will. If that place doesn't support me, I'll go back to the Eighth Route Army." Also, news from people arriving from Kaifeng indicates that prices in Kaifeng are incredibly high, the order is chaotic, and the landlords and reactionary corps who have fled are at their wits' end, universally lamenting: "The women we brought were raped, the money we brought is spent, a pot of muddy water costs 5,000!"

[Taihang, 29th] Due to the victory of our army's comprehensive counter-offensive, the success of the military and civilians throughout the region in protecting grain, and the results of our encirclement, the Chiang bandit-occupied areas around Taihang, such as Shijiazhuang, Xinxiang, Jixian, and Anyang, are experiencing shortages of supplies, a collapse of Chiang currency, and soaring prices. The price of millet in Xinxiang has risen from 26,000 yuan to 45,000 yuan per dou, and in Jixian from 40,000 yuan to 70,000 yuan. Cotton in Anyang has risen from 20,000 yuan to 50,000 yuan per catty. Gold has risen to 3.2 million yuan per tael. In Shijiazhuang, flour costs 10,000 yuan per catty, and cigarettes (20) cost 7,500 yuan. Shops are closing one after another, and merchants are fleeing to the liberated areas. A popular rhyme among the citizens describes the commercial tragedy as follows: "Grain stores become 'cool' stores, gold stores become 'ghost' stores (closed tall buildings look even more gloomy), wood factories become firewood factories (due to lack of fuel, wood and utensils are sold as firewood), hometown associations become 'central begging' associations (begging the Chiang government for relief every month), boy scouts become 'painful death' troops." To put on a show, the Chiang government has ordered businesses not to close, so many businesses are laying off staff, with some businesses leaving only one person to deal with the Chiang bandits. Furthermore, the streets have "three mores" and "three runs": more soldiers running all over the streets, more officials' wives running all over the streets, and more "refugees" (fleeing landlords) running everywhere from hunger. Such satirical remarks are very popular, and therefore the value of our Ji-Lu-Yu currency is unprecedentedly high, with each yuan equivalent to 39 Chiang yuan.

[Dispatch from Taiyue, 3rd] Our militia and guerrilla forces, which are besieging Anyi City, have successively controlled the villages around the city within five li, including Dongwang, Dashibei, Xujiazhuang, Luzigou, Fangzi Village, Zhoujiapo, and Zhangjiapo. They are using landmines and snipers to strictly blockade the city, and have captured more than 20 bandit soldiers and fleeing landlords. On the 22nd of last month, the Yan bandits, at the end of their rope, concentrated a battalion of troops in an attempt to break out and escape, advancing toward our Zhoujiapo (three li south of the city) position. They were routed by our guerrillas, with over 40 bandits killed or wounded. We suffered no casualties. According to Li Xiaolang and Li Wenxiang, self-defense corps members who recently escaped from Anyi City, the officers and soldiers inside the city are extremely panicked and feel that their death is not far off. Some are even secretly praying to gods for protection.

    太行周围“孤岛”粮食奇缺
    安阳匪临绝境
    我军紧围安邑阎匪逃生无路
    【本报冀鲁豫三日电】据自安阳逃出之商人谈：安阳蒋匪面临绝境，哀叫有作第二永年的危险。自我军收复永年，歼灭伪匪许铁英部后，安阳引起极度的惊慌混乱，近日来物价飞涨；现白面卖到八千元一斤，馒头一万元一斤，香油四万一斤，烧柴三万元八斤，日用品只靠联总的三四架飞机，每日来往两三次运输，其士兵职员，普遍急剧地增张着悲观厌战的情绪，到处酒醉打架，乱吵乱骂，因此这几句话便更流行了：“此处不养爷，彼有养爷处，彼处不养爷，回头找八路。”又息：自开封来人谈：开封物价奇贵，秩序紊乱，逃亡地主还乡团，更是走头无路，普遍哀叫着：“带的女人被奸，带的钱花完，一壶泥糊涂水五千！”
    【太行二十九日电】太行周围蒋匪所占之石门、新乡、汲县、安阳等地，由于我大军全面反攻胜利与全区军民护粮胜利和对其围困结果，物资断缺、蒋币狂跌、物价暴涨。新乡小米每斗由两万六千元涨至四万五千元，汲县由四万涨至七万元。安阳棉花每斤由二万涨至五万元。黄金每两则涨到三百二十万元。石门白面一斤一万元，纸烟（二十支）七千五百元。商店纷纷关门，商人纷纷逃来解放区，市民们流行着形容商业悲惨的歌谣为：“粮店变为凉店，金店变为阴店（关门后的高楼大厦显得更为阴森），木厂变为柴厂（因燃料缺乏木料和用具当柴卖），同乡会变为同央会（一月央告蒋政府救济），童子军变为痛死军。”蒋政府为装饰门面，下令不准商号关门，因而商号裁减人员者甚多，有的商号只留一人应付蒋匪。另外街上“三多”与“三跑”兵多满街跑，官太太多得满街跑，“难民”（逃亡地主）饿得到处跑。此等讽刺话甚为流行，因此我冀钞价值空前提高，每元合蒋币三十九元。
    【本报太岳三日电】围困安邑城的我民兵游击队，已先后控制城周五里的东王、大市北、徐家庄、芦子沟、房子村、周家坡、张家坡等村。并用地雷、冷枪严密封锁，先后活捉匪兵及逃亡地主二十余人。上月二十二日，穷途末路之阎匪集中一个营兵力，企图夺路逃跑，向我周家坡（城南三里）阵地进犯，当被我游击队击溃，毙伤匪四十余人，我无伤亡。据新从安邑城内逃出之阎匪自卫团李小朗、李文祥等供称：城内官兵异常恐慌，已感到死期不远。更有偷偷求神保佑的。
