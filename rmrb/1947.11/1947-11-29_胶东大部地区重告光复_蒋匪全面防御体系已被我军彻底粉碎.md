　　Xinhua News Agency, Huadong Front, 27th: A spokesperson for the front headquarters recently issued a statement regarding the major battle along the Jiao (County) - Gao (Mi) line. He first pointed out that our army in the Jiaodong battlefield has completely shattered Chiang Kai-shek's overall defense system, forcing him to switch to a defensive line along the Beihai coast and the entrenchment of certain isolated strongholds. This is the new situation on the entire Jiaodong battlefield.

　　The spokesperson stated: The Jiaodong line battle began on the 6th of this month. In one week, the Liberation Army defeated five and a half brigades of Chiang Kai-shek's 9th Reorganized Division and other units that were desperately trying to escape west between Gao and Wei. Then, they pursued eastward along the entire line, so demoralizing Chiang Kai-shek's troops who had fled to the Jiao-Gao area that they dared not stop. The remnants entrenched in Gaomi were already heavily besieged. Even Jiao County, which had significant strategic importance, was not defended.

　　The spokesperson pointed out: This sudden change in the situation was completely beyond Chiang Kai-shek's expectations. When Chiang Kai-shek invaded Jiaodong in August, he originally planned to form a solid "barrier position" from north to south with the three points of Ye County, Pingdu, and Gaomi, cutting off the connection between the Jiaodong Peninsula and the Shandong liberated area, in order to hand over this beautiful land of Jiaodong to his master, American imperialism. However, the development of the Jiaodong war situation over the past three months has completely contradicted Chiang Kai-shek's wishful thinking. The victory at the Jiao River in October ended Chiang Kai-shek's last desperate offensive, forcing him to switch to a comprehensive defense. This battle on the Jiao-Gao line has shattered his comprehensive defense. During this period, our army not only recovered Ye County and Pingdu, besieged Gaomi, and completely shattered Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "barrier position," but also recovered all the inland areas of Jiaodong, from north of Jimo, Qingdao in the south to Penglai, Huang County, Yantai, and south of Fushan in the north, and connected with the liberated areas south of the Jiaoji Railway for more than 200 li. Only the empty city of Laiyang remains isolated in the inland of Jiaodong, teetering on the brink. The entire Chiang Kai-shek forces in Jiaodong have been fragmented. The defeated 9th Reorganized Division and other units are gathering around the railway lines on the outskirts of Qingdao, hesitating and uncertain. The 477th Regiment of the 64th Reorganized Division is entrenched in Gaomi, while two brigades and the division headquarters of the 54th Reorganized Division have been besieged in a corner of Haiyang for half a month, surrounded by mountains on three sides and the sea on one side. Several attempts to break through have been repelled by our forces, and they cannot move. One regiment of that division is entrenched in the isolated city of Laiyang, while the main force of the 8th Reorganized Division is bogged down in the narrow coastal area along the Yantai-Longkou line, facing the vast sea and subject to attacks by the Liberation Army. A month ago, the spokesperson of the General Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army predicted that the Chiang Kai-shek forces in Jiaodong would inevitably follow the same tragic fate as the Chiang Kai-shek forces in northern Shaanxi. The developments of the past month have provided vivid evidence for this far-sighted prediction. The spokesperson finally stated: Over the past three months, Chiang Kai-shek has concentrated six reorganized divisions on this narrow Jiaodong Peninsula, carefully running around, yet they have been so fragmented. In the future, the Liberation Army will eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek forces in Jiaodong on a larger scale, thoroughly and completely, not allowing the enemy to escape, and removing all the defense strongholds of the Chiang Kai-shek forces in Jiaodong and even all of Shandong, with no exceptions for Jinan, Qingdao, and Yantai.

### 胶东大部地区重告光复　蒋匪全面防御体系已被我军彻底粉碎

　　胶东大部地区重告光复
  　蒋匪全面防御体系已被我军彻底粉碎
    【新华社华东前线二十七日电】前线指挥部发言人顷就胶（县）高（密）线大战发表谈话。首先指出胶东战场我军，已彻底粉碎了蒋匪的全面防御体系，而迫使其转入北海沿岸的一线防御及某些孤立据点的困守。这是目前整个胶东战场的新形势。
    发言人称：胶东线大战开始于本月六日，解放军于一周中在高潍间打败了急于西逃的蒋匪整九师等五个半旅，然后全线向东追击，打得逃至胶高地区之蒋匪丧魂落魄，不敢停留，连具有重大战略意义的胶县也不敢坚守，困踞高密残匪则已陷入重围。
    发言人指出：这个形势的急变，是完全出乎蒋贼意料之外的。当八月份蒋匪进犯胶东时，原拟以掖县、平度、高密三点由北而南结成一条巩固的“阻隔阵地”，切断胶东半岛和山东解放区的连系，以便把胶东这块大好河山拱手出卖给他的主子美帝国主义。但是，三个月来胶东战局的发展，却完全与蒋贼的美梦背道而驰，十月胶河大捷结束了蒋匪最后一点挣扎性攻势，迫使其转入全面防御，此次胶高线大战又把他的这个全面防御打得粉碎。在此期间，我军不但收复了掖县、平度、包围了高密、完全粉碎了蒋匪的所谓“阻隔阵地”，而且收复了南抵青岛即墨以北，北至蓬莱黄县、烟台、福山以南的全部胶东内地，在二百余里的胶济路上与铁路以南解放区打成一片。中间只有一个莱阳空城，孤悬在胶东内地，摇摇欲坠。整个胶东蒋匪已被我分割得七零八碎，此次被击败之整九师等部正逃集于青岛外围铁路沿线徘徊不定。整六十四师之四七七团困守高密一点，整五十四师之两个旅及师部被我围困于海阳一隅已达半月，三面临山一面临海，多次突围均被我打退，动弹不得。该师一个团则困守莱阳孤城，而整八师之主力则被拖在烟台至龙口一线的沿海狭长地带，面临汪洋大海，背受解放军的打击。一个月前人民解放军总部发言人就预料胶东蒋匪必将走上和陕北蒋匪一样的悲惨命运，一个月来事实的发展正给这个远见的预言提供了生动的佐证，发言人最后称：三个月来蒋匪集中六个整编师在这个狭窄的胶东半岛上，小心翼翼，东奔西跑，尚且被打得这样支离破碎，今后解放军必将更大规模的干脆彻底的歼灭胶东蒋匪，不许敌人逃跑，拔除整个胶东以至全山东的蒋军防御据点，连济南、青岛、烟台都不能例外。
