Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 30th: Late News: The important towns of Suide in northern Shaanxi and the strategic location of Wayao Fort were recovered by the People's Liberation Army on the 12th and 14th of this month, respectively. By this point, there were no enemy traces within the liberated areas east and north of Yan'an. After Hu Zongnan's 36th Division was annihilated, he still attempted to hold onto several strongholds to maintain a semblance of control. After the three cities of Yanchuan, Yanchang, and Qingjian were successively captured by us, and the defending enemies of all three cities were annihilated, Hu's confidence was completely lost. The bandit troops in Suide and Wayao, taking advantage of Liu Kan's failure to lead five or six bandit brigades to aid Qingjian, abandoned the cities and fled south.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 30th: A unit of the People's Liberation Army liberated Jixian County, southwestern Shanxi, for the first time on the 27th. The Hu bandits fled without a fight. It is reported that this county has been Yan Xishan's stronghold for many years, and a key transportation hub between Shanxi and Shaanxi. The Hu bandits stationed heavy troops to maintain their connection between western Shanxi and northern Shaanxi.

    我收复绥德瓦窑堡
    延安以东以北肃清匪踪
    晋西南我军解放吉县城
    【新华社西北三十日电】迟到消息：陕北重镇绥德与战略要地瓦窑堡两城，已于本月十二及十四日先后为解放军收复。至此延安以东及以北解放区境内已无敌踪。胡宗南在其三十六师被歼后，仍图死守若干据点以维残局。在延川、延长、清涧三城相继为我攻克，三城守敌均被歼灭之后，胡匪此一信心已完全丧失。绥、瓦两地匪军，乃乘刘戡率匪军五、六个旅援清涧失败之际，相率弃城南逃。
    【新华社晋绥三十日电】解放军一部于二十七日首次解放晋西南吉县县城，胡匪不战而逃。按该县为阎锡山盘据多年之老巢，为晋陕交通要地，胡匪置重兵防守以保持其晋西陕北的联系。
