Xinhua News Agency, East China, 15th – The military and civilians in Central China, in coordination with the southward counter-offensive of the Chen and Su armies, launched a full-scale offensive in October. According to preliminary statistics, a total of 8,315 Chiang bandits were annihilated, and 13 mortars and 60mm guns, 117 light and heavy machine guns, 1,992 rifles and carbines, and more than 114,000 rounds of ammunition were seized. Forty-four strongholds were captured or forced to retreat.

The local armed forces in northern Jiangsu smashed the desperate "mopping-up" operation of six regiments of Chiang bandits within six days in early October, killing and capturing more than 600 Chiang Kai-shek's 51st Division, 41st Brigade, 121st Regiment Commander Liu Wei and others. At the time when the Chen and Su armies liberated Lingbi and Siyang in northern Huaibei, the Central China Liberation Army waved its spears northward, wedging into the Chiang-occupied area south of the Longhai Railway, capturing Xin'an Town, an important town in the Funing-Guanyun section of the Tongyu Line, and annihilating more than 1,000 men from the 44th Division and local Chiang bandits. Taking advantage of the victory, they marched westward, successively capturing important strongholds such as Wulizhuang and Dingji north of Huaiyin, controlling more than 120 miles of the Huaiyin-Shuyang Highway, and liberating nearly a hundred villages and towns along the route. So far, the Central China Liberation Army and the Chen and Su armies advancing into northern Huaibei face each other across the Grand Canal, echoing each other from east to west. At the same time, the local armed forces in central Jiangsu continued to consolidate the newly recovered areas, compressing the Chiang bandits' transportation points and lines, and expanding their positions. On the 14th, the local armed forces of the four counties of Tong, Ru, Hai, and Qi in the Ninth Military District swept up the Chiang bandits on the Liuqiao-Shigang Highway on the east side of the Nantong-Rugao line, and successively captured many strongholds such as Huashi Street in one day, so that Nantong City, the command center of the Chiang bandits in central Jiangsu, is now facing the threat of the people's armed forces. At the same time, the local armed forces in eastern Haimen, after nine days and nights of encirclement, forced the retreat of the last stronghold, Niuzhuqiao. Now there are no enemies in the area of more than 2,000 square miles. The local armed forces south of the Haian-Taizhou line made a surprise attack, and once captured Rugao and Huangqiao, Chiang bandits' combat bases, on the 28th, which frightened Chiang Kai-shek's bandits.
