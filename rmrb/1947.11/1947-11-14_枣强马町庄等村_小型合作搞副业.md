From our Jinnan office, 12th: Machingzhuang in Zaoqiang county has mostly sandy and alkaline soil, coupled with summer droughts, resulting in poor autumn harvests. The general populace, through household planning, discovered a food shortage and difficult living conditions. Under the principle of voluntary association, they organized small-scale cooperatives to engage in sideline occupations to supplement their food supply. Zhang Xueqi and six others formed a flour mill, bought four pigs to raise, and built a large pigpen. They started organizing on October 4th and officially opened the mill on the 21st. Furthermore, Ma Jinsuo and four others opened a tofu shop, attending four market days every ten days, selling two pots of firm tofu. On their off days, they make two batches of tofu to sell in the villages and are also raising two pigs. Simultaneously, Zhang Xuetian, Ma Rongshui, and ten others established a traditional Chinese medicine shop, with each share tentatively set at 5,000 yuan, located in Dataihu Village. They will begin offering medical consultations within days. The masses in Tanglin County are also organizing to engage in sideline occupations. The entire village of 178 households has organized a cooperative, primarily to solve the difficulties faced by emancipated farmers during the spring famine. Currently, 135 households have joined, each contributing ten jin of coarse grains, returning the same type of grain they contributed. Accounts are settled every three months, and shareholders can withdraw their shares at any time in case of unexpected events. The cooperative also helps to alleviate the difficulties of the families of soldiers. As of the 7th, they had collected a total of 20,000 jin of millet and 90 jin of coarse grains. There are forty employees, all from middle and poor peasant backgrounds, with a daily wage of 7.2 yuan and a 10% bonus. They are divided into four groups: one transportation group and three flour mill groups. The three flour mills can feed thirty pigs, accumulating forty-five large cartloads of manure in three months, equivalent to ninety cartloads of animal manure. The cooperative has already started operations.
