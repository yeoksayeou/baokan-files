　　Shijiazhuang - A Crumbling Isolated Island
　　Chiang Captives Tell of the Suffering of the Cornered Beast
　　After more than 10,000 men of the Third Army were annihilated, when reporters spoke with captured officers and soldiers about their six months of bitter defense of Shijiazhuang, they still felt a headache thinking about it. After the battle around Shijiazhuang in April, Shijiazhuang was tightly surrounded by the liberated area's military and civilians, becoming an isolated island on land. Deputy Adjutant Zhang, a captain in the Third Army, said: "Since April, we have been bitterly defending Shijiazhuang, unable to go more than five li to the east or west. To make an analogy, we are like dead people who have not been buried, simply living corpses." With our army's continuous attacks and the development of guerrilla warfare, all land transportation to Shijiazhuang was cut off, trade was blocked, goods were extremely scarce, prices soared, and the economic crisis reached its peak. Prices rose three times a day; from April to now, prices have generally increased four or five times. Because Chiang's senior officials were preparing to flee, hoarding gold rather than goods, the price of gold rose sharply, from 600,000 yuan this spring to 5 million yuan in October. Chiang's senior officials and party thugs in Shijiazhuang stirred up trouble, stealing and selling seized materials, hoarding for speculation, collecting salaries for nonexistent soldiers, engaging in corruption, smuggling, and making a fortune from the civil war, while the people were on the verge of death from the exploitation of these bandits. The families of Chiang's junior officers and the vast number of soldiers also fell into the abyss of hunger and poverty, and military rations were in extreme short supply. Before April, they did not eat millet, but later changed to a 3:7 ratio of refined to coarse grains. After July, it changed even more to an inverted 3:7 (3 refined, 7 coarse), inverted 2:8, and inverted 1:9. The dependents' rations of the officers' families have been completely stopped since September. A lieutenant-level officer receiving 400,000 to 500,000 yuan a month could barely buy a bag of flour. As for Chiang's soldiers, who were subjected to layers of suffering and exploitation, they had only been issued a pair of shoes since May. A second-class soldier receiving a salary of 60,000 yuan could no longer afford a whole pack of cigarettes. Whether officers or soldiers, salaries were mostly pre-spent for the next month, leaving them constantly short of breath. A captured senior officer said: "Prices are rising so fast that we can't keep up. We have long been living a miserable life, dragging on day by day. Anything costs tens of thousands. In this situation, senior officials are corrupt, soldiers are robbing, and things are getting more and more chaotic, and the more they rob, the worse it gets."
　　Since the battle around Shijiazhuang in April, the morale of Chiang's bandits has plummeted. Whether officers or soldiers, they were constantly worried about our army's attack. The "three confidences" of "trust," "faith," and "self-confidence" that Chiang's bandits in Shijiazhuang put forward have been completely lost under our army's continuous attacks. A captured officer of the Third Army said: "We cannot trust the superiors who repeatedly deceive us; we cannot trust each other because they do not help each other in battle; we have no confidence because we do not know when we will be annihilated." This is a true reflection of the morale of Chiang's Third Army.
　　In order to support this group of bandits, the people of Shijiazhuang were subjected to endless exorbitant taxes and levies. The market has been extorted to the point of being desolate and萧条，the people are struggling to survive, businesses are closing down, and beggars are everywhere. But there is something even more tragic; the villages within a dozen li of the city have been constantly robbed by Chiang's bandits, puppet troops, and local bullies, and are now a scene of desolation. A captured deputy adjutant of the Third Army once said: "Rabbits don't eat grass near their burrows, but we have eaten all the grass near our burrows. The burrow is empty, and we don't dare to go far. What can we do if we don't eat the grass near the burrow?" The reporter asked some captured Chiang's soldiers who had participated in grain robbery, and they confessed that "life in the city was very hard. As soon as we left the city, we were overjoyed, thinking that it was another opportunity to eat pork. Wherever we went, we killed pigs and ate chickens." A captured company political instructor of Chiang's army said that he had personally seen soldiers of the Third Army snatching flowered pants from villagers in the suburbs and exchanging them for goods at used goods stalls.... These bandits are maintaining their dying lives by trampling on the people in this way. (Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 12th)

　　石门——摇摇欲坠的孤岛
  　蒋俘诉述困兽之苦
    第三军万余人被歼灭了，记者和被俘官兵谈话中，提起他们苦守石庄的半年，他们至今还头痛着；四月石庄外围战役后，石家庄便陷入解放区军民严密的围困中成为陆上孤岛。第三军上尉张副官说：“从四月以后我们苦守石庄，东走不出五里，西走不出五里；要做个比喻，我们好比死了的人没有埋，简直就象活死人。”随着我军连续打击，和游击战争的开展，石庄陆路交通全部断绝，贸易阻塞，货物奇缺，物价飞涨，经济危机发展到顶点。物价一日三涨；从四月到现在，物价普遍高涨四、五倍。由于蒋记高级官员准备逃跑，存金不存物的结果，金价陡涨不止，由今春六十万元至十月已涨至五百万元。石庄的蒋家高级官员、党棍等都兴风作浪，盗卖接收物资，囤集居奇，吃空额，贪污，走私，大发内战血财，人民被这帮匪徒们压榨的奄奄一息。而蒋匪下级官佐家属及广大士兵亦陷入饥饿穷困的深渊，军粮极度恐慌。四月以前他们是不吃小米的，以后改为粗细粮三、七比，七月以后更一变而为倒三七（细三粗七）、倒二八、倒一九。军官家属的眷粮从九月份已完全停发了。一个月领四、五十万的尉级军官，也不过买到一袋面。至于在苦难层层剥削下的蒋家士兵，从五月份起，只发了一双鞋子，领着六万军饷的二等兵，早已买不起整包的香烟。无论官兵，薪饷多是上月预支下月，上气不接下气。被俘的某高级军官说：“物价猛涨我们追都追不上；我们早已过着拖一日算一日的愁惨生活。任何东西一动数万。在这样情况下，大官贪污，士兵抢劫，愈弄愈乱，越抢越糟。”
    自四月石庄外围战役后，蒋匪士气一蹶不振，无论官兵时时耽心我军攻击。石庄蒋匪所提的“信任”、“信仰”、“自信”的“三信心”，在我军连续的打击下已失落干净。被俘之第三军一个军官说：“上级屡次欺骗不能信仰；彼此作战见死不救，不能信任，自己不知何时被歼，没有自信。”这就是蒋匪第三军士气的写照。
    石庄群众为了供养这批匪徒，苛捐杂税层出不穷，市面已被勒索的冷落萧条，民不聊生，商号倒闭，乞丐满街。然而还有比这更凄惨的；市外十数里内的村庄，经过蒋匪伪军地头蛇不断抢劫，已经是满目荒凉。被俘第三军上尉副官曾经这样说：“兔子不吃窝边草，可是我们就连窝边草都吃光了。窝里空空如也，远处不敢去，不吃窝边草，有什么办法？”记者曾问过一些参加过抢粮的被俘蒋军，他们自供“在市内生活很苦，一出市外，便喜出望外，认为又是吃猪肉的机会到了。”“我们所到之处，见猪杀猪，见鸡吃鸡。”被俘蒋军一个连指导员说，他亲眼看到第三军士兵从市郊抢回老乡的花裤，到旧货摊换东西……。这般匪徒就是这样的蹂躏人民来维持垂死的生活。（新华社晋察冀十二日电）
