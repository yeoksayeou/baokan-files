The Experiment of Land Mutual Aid
New Developments in the Yucheng Sanhe Mutual Aid Group in Jincheng
Lu Sheng

(1) How "Land Mutual Aid" Was Proposed.

During the weeding in April this year, everyone who farmed knew the principle of "weeding the best land first," so everyone wanted to be weeded first. Although the Yucheng Village's "work points based on work done, dividends based on work points" was very meticulous, and the integration of agriculture, sideline occupations, and participation in the war was very good, it still couldn't solve this practical problem. One member of the mutual aid group said, "It would be better to eat from one pot." At the time, Han Jiarong disagreed with his opinion, saying, "It's not time yet. Are you afraid that you won't be eating from one pot in the future?" The member said, "Then what do you do now?" Jiarong said, "I think we should measure the land, democratically assess the yield, and at the end of each season, we can manage it based on yield and work points." Everyone felt that what he said made sense and agreed, saying, "People say our Fifth Group is a model group, so let's try this method." At noon, the Communist Party member reported these opinions to the branch secretary, who was also a labor hero, Sun Qunxiao. Qunxiao said, "Let's have a meeting of our branch to study it first." Everyone felt that implementing "land mutual aid" was a further development of the Sanhe Group, so they decided to first discuss it in the Fifth Group, preparing to try it out during the autumn harvest, gain experience, and then promote its implementation throughout the Sanhe Group.

When summarizing the village's half-year production work in August, the Fifth and Eighth Groups were selected as model groups. At the congratulatory meeting on the 21st, each group, in order to learn from the Fifth Group, challenged the Fifth Group. When challenging each other, they first stated that they were prepared to implement the new method of "land mutual aid," and then proposed the conditions for the challenge, which was to implement the new method of "land mutual aid" during the autumn harvest and wheat planting. Unexpectedly, the Eighth Group had also been considering this issue for a long time. As soon as they heard that the Fifth Group was going to experiment, they immediately challenged the Fifth Group again, with the condition being who could implement the new method of "land mutual aid" first. After the meeting, Comrade Qunxiao also saw the new method of "labor as shares, land equally divided" published in the New China Daily on August 29th, which further increased his courage to implement "land mutual aid." Thus, he called on the Fifth and Eighth Groups to strive to start implementing it during the autumn harvest. In this way, the new method of "land mutual aid" changed from thought to action.

(2) Specific Methods of Land Mutual Aid.

Even branch secretary Comrade Qunxiao did not expect that all ten groups in the entire Sanhe Group would demand to implement this new method of "land mutual aid" during the autumn harvest. Seeing that the Fifth and Eighth Groups were implementing the new method of "land mutual aid," the other groups often sent people to participate in their discussion meetings. Upon returning to their groups, they reported what the new method of "land mutual aid" was and automatically launched in-depth discussions. This formed a mass movement throughout the village. Regardless of men, women, old, or young, they enthusiastically discussed this one issue—the benefits of "land mutual aid" and the various incomprehensible issues of implementing "land mutual aid"—during the day, at night, while working, and while eating. Before the autumn harvest, all the groups had cleared their minds and unanimously requested that the leadership allow them to implement this method. Since the masses had already reached ideological maturity, based on the opinions of each group, they further implemented land mutual aid on the basis of integrating agriculture, sideline occupations, and participation in the war. The specific methods were: 1. The land of the members of each group was cultivated collectively. The land of each household was accurately measured, and the yield was democratically assessed. The yield was based on actual yield standards. The total account was calculated for the summer and autumn seasons. The grain harvested was divided among each household based on the yield per mu of land, and the surplus grain was used as dividends, which were then distributed based on work points. 2. Accept the opinions of the military cadres and their families in the entire village. The military cadres and their families, who were able to spin cotton and weave cloth, participated in land mutual aid with great effort, and the villagers no longer gave them preferential treatment. The three-vote system of "work, duty, and preferential" for military personnel and their families was changed to a two-vote system of "work and duty." The duty vote was still handled according to the original method. The work vote was the responsibility of the group leader. After collectively assessing work done each day, the group leader issued work tickets to each group member. Accounts were settled once a month, and the work was recorded in the general ledger. When settling the final account for the summer and autumn seasons, the entire village was fully accounted for, with surpluses and deficits balanced. Military families who did not participate in land mutual aid were still given preferential treatment according to the previous method. 3. All farm tools and livestock were centrally used within the group. Each group set up a farm tool room and a livestock room. The farm tools and livestock of each person were democratically assessed at the current market price, based on their condition (new or old, good or bad), as production funds. When collectively used farm tools were damaged, the entire group compensated. Livestock capable of plowing land were priced and then fed by the collective for collective use. Death due to natural causes was the owner's loss, while death due to public service (such as participating in the war) was compensated by the entire group. Small cattle that could not plow land were priced at a fixed price according to the market price and belonged to the entire group, but the owner could freely dispose of them if they wished. When settling accounts for the summer and autumn seasons, agricultural funds were allocated to sideline occupation dividends (at 1%), and in addition to allocating sideline occupation dividends based on the depreciated value of livestock, agricultural dividends were also allocated based on labor. 4. The three types of work—agriculture, sideline occupations, and participation in the war—were all equal within the group. Participation in the war and transportation outside the village were paid for by the group, while food at home was the responsibility of the individual. Work points were recorded at the end of each month. Duty votes were calculated every three months, equally dividing the entire village based on the number of people who should be performing duties, fully accounting for it, and balancing surpluses and deficits to avoid losses. In this way, all able-bodied laborers could specialize in participating in the war. People engaged in sideline occupations could also specialize, and people without labor could also feed cattle and take care of farm tools, achieving the goal of everyone participating in the war and everyone learning both sets of skills—participation in the war and production. 5. In order to promote the accumulation of large amounts of manure, all manure also belonged to the entire group. Various types of manure were priced based on their quality, effectiveness, and size, collectively carried, and collectively evaluated. At the end of the settlement, sideline occupation dividends were distributed based on the funds (at 2%).

(3) Problems That Could Not Be Solved in the Past Have Been Solved.

The entire group implemented the new method of land mutual aid starting from wheat planting. In the experiment of over a month so far, four hundred work days have been saved in cattle feeding alone. In addition to saving a lot of labor, many problems that could not be solved during the Sanhe mutual aid have been solved, such as: 1. Solved the problem of who does what first. In the Sanhe mutual aid, disputes over who hoes first, who plows first often occurred, but none of them were completely resolved. The problem was solved during weeding, but it occurred again during planting. Everyone was afraid of planting late, and everyone was afraid of harvesting late. After land mutual aid, no one talked about first or last anymore. They planted this piece and then planted that piece, working forward together. When planting wheat, everyone said it was all the group's land. It didn't matter which piece was planted first, as long as it was all planted well. There was no difference between first and last. 2. The fear of damaging farm tools and livestock and delaying work was also solved. During the Sanhe mutual aid, collective labor and scattered farm tools often resulted in running all over the village to borrow a rake and still not being able to borrow it, because no one wanted to let others use it, and if it was damaged, the individual had to buy it. Sometimes, production was delayed due to not being able to borrow farm tools. After the farm tools were centralized, there was whatever was needed, and now everyone wants to buy more farm tools, because if they are damaged, everyone buys them, and they can also be used as funds to distribute dividends. In the past, households with livestock were tired from working during the day and feeding the livestock at night and didn't get work points. Now there are special people to feed the cattle, and feeding the cattle is also recorded as work, so no one is troubled anymore. 3. Thoroughly solved the ideological concerns of personnel participating in the war. During the Sanhe mutual aid, although livestock participating in the war earned more work points, no one wanted to go, because damaging a cow meant losing tens of thousands. After land mutual aid, households with livestock were no longer afraid of losses. If they died due to public service (such as participating in the war), the group compensated. Households without livestock also wanted to buy livestock. For example, during the Sanhe mutual aid, although the land of personnel participating in the war was planted first, they were uneasy, such as the militiamen saying, "The land has been planted, but there is no manure, so it is better to stay at home." Now this concern has been eliminated. This time, when participating in the war, everyone was eager to go. Before leaving, they all said, "Not to mention going for three to six months, we can rest assured even if it is three years." (Taiyue Branch)

    土地互助的实验
    晋城庾能三合互助组的新发展
    鲁生
    （一）怎样提出“土地互助”的。
    今年四月锄苗时，种地的谁也懂得“先锄顶上粪”的道理，因此谁也想叫给他先锄，虽然庾能村“按活计工按工分红”很细致，农副业结合参战结合的很好，也解决不了这个实际问题。有一个互助组员说：“真不如吃一锅饭好”。当时韩甲荣不同意他的意见，说“现在还不到时候，你怕将来不吃一锅饭”。他说“那你现在怎么办”？甲荣说：“我说我看咱们把土地丈一下，民主评定产量，每季做下来按产量按工分还能办到”。大家都觉得他说的有理，一致赞同的说：“人家都说咱五组是模范小组，这个办法咱组就试试吧”。晌午共产党员把这些意见反映给支书又是劳动英雄的孙群肖，群肖说“咱们支部先开个会研究研究吧”。大家觉得实行“土地互助”是三合组的进一步的发展，便确定先在五组中酝酿，准备在秋收中试行，得出经验，再推动全三合组实行。
    八月总结全村半年生产工作时，五、八两组被选为模范组，在二十一日的贺功大会上，各组为向五组学习，纷纷向五组挑战，互相应战时首先说明他们准备实行“土地互助”的新办法，接着提出应战条件，是秋收种麦中实行“土地互助”新办法。不料八组对这问题也酝酿了很久，一听五组要试验，马上又向五组再挑战，以谁能先实行“土地互助”新办法为条件。会后群肖同志又见到八月二十九号新华日报登的“劳力入股土地平分”的新办法，更增加了实行“土地互助”的勇气，于是就号召五、八两组争取在秋收时开始实行。这样“土地互助”新办法就由思想变为行动了。
    （二）土地互助的具体办法。
    连支书群肖同志也没预料到秋收时全三合组十个组都要求实行这个“土地互助”的新办法，各组见五、八组实行“土地互助”新办法，又常派人去参加他们的讨论会，回到组里便报告“土地互助”新办法是什么，也自动展开深入的讨论。这样就在全村中形成一个群众运动，各组不管男女老少在白天夜间做活吃饭时，都是热烈讨论着这一个问题——“土地互助”的好处和实行“土地互助”的各个想不通的问题。到秋收前，各组都打通了思想，一致要求领导上允许各组都实行这种办法，既然群众在思想上已经酝酿成熟，于是根据各组的意见，在农副业参战结合的基础上，便进一步实行了土地互助。其具体办法是：一、各组组员的土地集中耕种，各户土地都经精确丈量，民主评议产量，产量是以实产量标准，夏秋两季算总帐，所收粮食共按地亩产量分归各家，余粮作为红利，再按工分红。二、接受全村军干属意见，军干属能纺花织布大变工，参加土地互助，不让村人再优待，将工、差、优军三票制改为工、差二票制，差票仍按原办法，工票由各组长负责，每天集体按活评工后，组长按工给各组员发工票，每月算一次帐，把工记在总帐上，夏秋两季总结帐时，全村满打满算，长得短出，没有参加土地互助的军属仍按以前优待办法优待。三、农具牲畜全集中组内使用，每组设农具室牲畜室各一，各人的农具、牲畜均以目前市价按新旧好坏民主评议作价为生产资金。农器集体使用损坏时，由全组赔补，能耕地的牲畜作价后，由公家喂集体用，病死属私，因公而死者（如参战）全组赔，不能耕地的小牛按市价作成死价属于全组，但本人不愿时可自由处理。夏秋结帐时，农业资金分副业红利（按百分之一），牲畜要按折价资金分副业红利外，还按劳功分农业红利。四、农副业参战三种工在组里都是工顶工，参战和运输在外吃花由组负担，在家吃自己，每月底记工。差票每三月总算一次，按应支差人数平分全村，满打满算，长得短出，以不吃亏为原则，这样全劳力就可专门去参战。搞副业的人也可专门化，无劳力人也可喂牛保管农具，做到人人参战个个学会参战生产两套本领。五、为推动大量积粪，全部粪土也属于全组，各种粪土均按质量好坏作用大小作成价，集体担，集体评议，到总结时按资金分副业红利（按百分之二）。
    （三）过去解决不了的问题解决了。
    全组从种麦开始就实行了土地互助新办法，至今月余中的实验中，单喂牛一项即省四百个工，过去每日二十四工，现在每日六工。除省工很多外，把在三合互助时的许多解决不了的问题都解决了，如：一、解决了先做后做的问题。三合互助时先锄后锄先犁后犁的争执时常发生，但都没有得到彻底的解决，锄苗时解决了到下种时又发生了，谁也怕种的晚，谁也怕收的迟。土地互助后，谁也不说先后了，种了这块种那块，挨着向前干，种麦时大家说都是咱组的，不管先种那块吧，只要都种好，先后没啥分别。二、怕用坏农具牲口误工的思想也解决了，三合互助时集体劳动农具分散，往往因借一柄耙跑遍全村还借不上，因为谁也不肯叫用，用坏还得私人买，有时因借不到农具还误了生产。农具集中后，用什有什，并且现在谁也想多买农具了，因为用坏大家买，又可作资金分红利，过去有牲口户白天劳动夜间喂牲口又累又没工，现在有专人喂牛了，喂牛也记工，大家谁也不麻烦了。三、彻底解决参战人员的思想顾虑。三合互助时，牲口参战虽然顶工多，可谁也不想去，因为用坏一头牛就是十几万。土地互助后，有牲口户不怕损失了，因公（如参战）而死的，组里赔偿，没牲口户也想买牲口了。又如三合互助时虽然是参战人员的地先种，但他们是心里不安，如民兵说：“地种上了没有粪土，还是在家好。”现在这个顾虑解除了，这次参战时，人人争着去，临走时都说：“不说走三月至六月，就是三年也放心”。（太岳分社）
