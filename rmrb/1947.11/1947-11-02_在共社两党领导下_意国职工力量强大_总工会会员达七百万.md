Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: Rome dispatch: The Italian workers' movement, under the leadership of the Italian Communist Party and the Socialist Party, is growing in strength. This is particularly evident in the increasing consolidation of the leading position of the Communist and Socialist parties within the Italian General Confederation of Labor, the expansion of its influence, and the rapid increase in its membership.

Since its establishment in January 1945, the Italian General Confederation of Labor has added 2.5 million members, now totaling 7 million workers and civil servants. It has 57 affiliated trade unions. The leading body of the General Confederation is the leadership committee, composed of 75 people, of whom 38 are members of the Communist Party, 20 are members of the Socialist Party, 11 are members of the Christian Democratic Party, 2 are members of the Saragat faction, and several others belong to other parties. The leadership committee also elected an executive committee and a secretariat. The executive committee is composed of 21 people, including 7 Communist Party members such as Vittorio and Bitossi, 4 Socialist Party members such as Sacchi, 3 Christian Democratic Party members, 1 member each from the Saragat faction and the Republican Party, and 5 members from other parties. The secretariat is composed of 7 people. The General Secretary is Vittorio, and the Communist Party also holds the positions of both the First and Deputy Secretary. The Socialist Party also has a First Secretary and a Deputy Secretary.

The Communist and Socialist parties in the General Confederation of Labor have the support of the vast majority of members. For example, at the First National Congress of the General Confederation of Labor in early June this year, out of 4,568,000 votes, more than 2,612,000 voted in favor of the policies of the Italian Communist Party, more than 1,037,000 voted for the Socialist Party, and only more than 610,000 voted for the Christian Democratic Party. This shows that the influence of the reactionaries in the workers' movement has been extremely reduced.

The Italian reactionaries, headed by the Christian Democratic Party, have repeatedly carried out disruptive activities to split the workers' movement and the General Confederation of Labor, but the unity of the Italian workers' movement and the solidarity within the General Confederation of Labor are becoming increasingly consolidated and developed. The First National Congress of the General Confederation of Labor in June this year embodied the solidarity of the Italian working class in its struggle and seriously struck a blow to the various attempts by the Christian Democratic Party to split and undermine it. At this congress, the Christian Democratic Party and other reactionaries tried to restrict the activities of the General Confederation of Labor to the sphere of economic struggle and put forward many proposals such as "do not let the General Confederation of Labor interfere in purely political issues," but they were all rejected by an overwhelming majority of votes. The congress passed the General Confederation of Labor's charter and many motions proposed by the Communist and Socialist parties, which pointed out that the General Confederation of Labor demanded "to defend the republic, develop people's democracy and freedom, restore and develop the country's economy, and unite to fight against raising prices and inflation and demand wage increases." General Secretary Vittorio emphasized at the meeting, "The congress not only believes in, but has also realized the unity of the Italian workers' trade union movement."

Since the June congress, with the support of American imperialism, the Italian reactionaries have continued to actively carry out activities to undermine the workers' movement, but their efforts have been extremely ineffective. According to a statement made by General Confederation of Labor Secretary Bitossi (a Communist Party member) in September, "Due to the activities of the American Federation of Labor, another trade union has been formed in Italy, and newspapers have been established in Italy with a large amount of money. However, only 15,000 to 20,000 workers in Italy have been drawn into this union, which is insignificant compared to the Italian General Confederation of Labor, which has 7 million members. The Italian General Confederation of Labor is a powerful force in Italy and enjoys the trust of the working people."

    在共社两党领导下
    意国职工力量强大
    总工会会员达七百万
    【新华社陕北卅日电】罗马讯：在意共与社会党领导下的意大利职工运动，其力量在日益壮大，这特别表现在意大利总工会中共产党与社会党两党领导地位的益趋巩固，及其影响的扩大和会员的猛增上面。
    意总工会自一九四五年一月成立以来，迄今会员已增加二百五十万人，现有会员七百万工人及公务员。其属下之工会达五十七个。总工会的领导机关，是由七十五人所组成的领导委员会，其中共产党占三十八人，社会党二十人，基督教民主党十一人，萨拉盖特派二人及其他党派数人。领导委员会会又选出了执委会和书记局，执委会由二十一人组成，其中有维托利奥、比托西等共产党员七人，沙克蒡等社会党员四人，基民党三人，萨拉盖特派及共和党各一人，以及其他党派五人。书记局由由七人组成，总书记为维托利奥，共产党员尚占有正副书记各一人。社会党亦有正副书记各一人。
    总工会中共、社两党得到绝大多数会员的拥护与支持。例如在今年六月初总工会第一次全国代表大会上、在四百五十六万八千张投票中，投票赞成意共政策的为二百六十一万二千余人，投社会党票者为一百零三万七千余人，投基民党票的，仅六十一万余票，这说明了反动派在职工运动中影响已极度低落。
    以基民党为首的意大利反动派，曾一再进行分裂职工运动和总工会的破坏活动，但意职工运动的统一，和总工会内部的团结，正越益巩固与发展中。本年六月总工会第一次全国代表大会，体现了意工人阶级斗争的团结一致，严重打击了基民党分裂与破坏的各种企图。在这次大会上，基民党及其他反动分子们，曾力图把总工会活动限制在经济斗争的圈子内，曾提出了：“不让总工会干涉纯政治问题”等许多提案，但都遭到了绝大多数票的否决。大会通过了共、社两党所提的总工会章程及许多议案，其中指出：总工会要求“保卫共和国，发展人民的民主和自由，恢复和发展国家的经济，并为反对抬高物价和通货膨胀，要求增资而联合斗争。”总书记维托利奥在会中曾强调称：“代表大会不仅确信，而且实现了意大利劳动者职工运动的统一。”
    从六月大会以来，在美国帝国主义支持下，意反动派仍积极进行破坏职工运动的活动，但其收效极征。据总工会书记比托西（共产党员）九月间发表的谈话中说：“由于美国劳工联合会的活动，意大利组成了另一职工会，并且以大量金元在意国创办报纸。然而全意工人被拉到这一工会中去的不过一万五千人到两万人。与拥有七百万会员的意大利总工会相较，是微不足道的。意大利总工会是意国强大的力量，并掮有人劳动人民的信任。”
