Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 26th -- The Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Northeast Administrative Committee, and the General Political Department of the Democratic United Army have recently issued a decision on the handling of honored servicemen. An overall Northeast Honored Servicemen Management Committee will be organized to provide unified leadership, and the provincial governments will organize provincial Honored Servicemen Management Committees to handle the education and care of honored servicemen within their respective provinces. The decision points out that with the development of the war situation, the number of honored servicemen is bound to increase in the future, and all localities must complete this task as a war task, regarding the mobilization of troops, the treatment of wounded personnel, and the resettlement of disabled soldiers as a series of tasks to support the war. Because honored servicemen are heroes who kill the enemy in the patriotic war to defend their homes and land, they must be respected politically and cared for in their lives, strengthened in education, and have their class consciousness raised, so that they can continue to maintain the glorious tradition of the people's army and be good cadres and good citizens. At the same time, they should be given appropriate work according to their physical condition, education level, and working ability. Each province should establish schools for honored servicemen to accommodate the lightly disabled and conduct regular training to cultivate them as cadres. For honored servicemen whose families are in the liberated areas, and in areas with good mass work, some may be allowed to retire on a voluntary basis, but the government must ensure their livelihoods and help them settle down. For the severely disabled, each province should establish homes for honored servicemen to accommodate them, carry out management and education, and organize manual labor suitable to their physical conditions to gradually help them establish their livelihoods. Regarding the supply of honored servicemen, all those living in nursing homes and honored servicemen schools who have not been assigned work will have all their supplies borne by the General Management Office. As for the working cadres of the honored servicemen's schools and the honored servicemen who have been assigned work, all their supplies will be borne by the provinces themselves.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 26th -- Honored servicemen in the rear areas of Northeast China are working hard to produce and improve their education, and a large number of lightly disabled who have recovered are entering various work positions. More than 200 honored servicemen in the Dongning Sanatorium in Mudanjiang Province have established their own families by their own efforts, participating in spinning, raising pigs, grazing sheep, fishing, and planting grain and vegetables. The industrial and agricultural cooperative operated by the sanatorium has developed from a capital of 700,000 yuan to 12 million yuan, of which 5 million yuan is held by honored servicemen. The cooperative is now using millions of yuan to establish a textile factory cooperative to organize and train honored servicemen to participate in production work. The Honored Servicemen's School in Suibin County, Hegang Province, with more than 600 people, cultivates 80 hectares of land and has tofu workshops, flour workshops, and shoe shops, earning 15 million yuan. In addition to solving all daily necessities, each person is also issued a pair of leather shoes and a mattress. Currently, 1.5 million yuan in dividends have been withdrawn to buy cars and horses in preparation for large-scale production. In their spare time, honored servicemen also work hard to study culture. Those who have lost their right arm practice writing with their left hand, and those who are blind learn mental arithmetic. Those who did not know a single word in the past can now recognize four or five hundred characters. In daily life, the lightly disabled help the severely disabled serve meals and pour water, and those who go out to produce have their clothes mended and quilts washed by those at home, highly promoting the spirit of unity and fraternity. The whole school is like a warm family. Honored servicemen are treated favorably by the people and government agencies in various places. When they leave the hospital, they can easily find suitable work in departments such as forestry bureaus, post and telecommunications bureaus, iron factories, and cooperatives. Recently, more than 500 honored servicemen from Dongning, Jilin, and Nenjiang have entered various work positions.

　　东北党政军联合颁发决定
  　尊重爱护荣誉军人
    大批荣军涌入各种工作岗位
    【新华社东北二十六日电】中共中央东北局，东北行政委员会暨民主联军总政治部，顷颁发关于处理荣誉军人的决定。组织东北荣军总管理委员会统一领导，并以各省政府为主组织各省荣军管理委员会，处理本省范围内荣军教养工作。该决定指出随着战争形势的发展，今后荣誉军人的数量势必增加，各地必须把这一项工作当作战争任务来完成，把动员参军，治疗负伤人员，安置残废军人，看成是一连串的支援战争任务。由于荣誉军人是爱国保田自卫战争中的杀敌英雄，必须在政治上尊重他们，在生活上予以照顾，加强教育，提高他们的阶级觉悟，使其继续保持人民军队的光荣传统，做一个好干部好公民。同时根据他们的身体条件，文化水平，工作能力给以适当的工作。各省应建立荣誉军人学校，收容轻残废，进行按期训练，将他们培养为干部。对于家在解放区的荣誉军人，以及群众工作好的地区，在其自愿原则下，可以允许部分退伍，但政府必须使其生活有保障，帮助他们安家立业。对于重残废，各省应建立荣誉军人教养院，予以收容，进行管理教育和组织适合其身体条件的手艺劳动，以逐渐帮助其建立家务。关于荣军供给问题，凡住教养院及荣军学校未分配工作者，一切供给均由总管理处负担。至于荣军学校工作干部与已分配工作之荣军，其一切供给则由各省自行负担。
    【新华社东北二十六日电】东北荣誉军人在后方各地休养中努力生产，提高文化，并有大批休养痊愈的轻残废涌入各个工作岗位。牡丹江省东宁休养院二百余荣军自己动手建立家务，参加纺织、养猪、放羊、打鱼、及种粮种菜等工作，该院经营的工农合作社已由七十万元的资本发展到一千二百万，其中荣军入股者达五百万元。现该社正以数百万资金建立纺织厂合作社，组织训练荣军参加生产工作。六百余人的合江省绥滨县荣军学校种地八十垧，并有豆腐坊，粉坊，鞋铺生产，获利一千五百万元，除解决所有日用品外，每人并发皮鞋一双，褥子一床。现已抽出红利一百五十万元买车买马，准备大生产。业余时间荣军并努力学习文化，断了右臂的用左手练字，双目失明的学习心算，过去一字不识的现在有的已能识四五百字。日常生活中，轻残废帮助重残废盛饭倒水，出外生产者则由在家的替其补衣洗被，高度发扬了团结友爱的精神，全校象一个温暖的大家庭。荣军在各地均受人民和各政府机关的优待，当他们出院时，很容易的就能在林务局、邮电局、铁工厂、合作社等各部门中找到适合于自己的工作。最近东宁、吉林、嫩江三地即有荣军五百余人涌入各种工作岗位。
