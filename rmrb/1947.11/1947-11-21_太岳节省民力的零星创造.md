　　Scattered Creations in Taiyue Area to Save Civilian Labor

　　During the tense year of the self-defense war, a large amount of civilian labor was indeed used. In the use of civilian labor, many methods were created, generally ensuring full support for the war without hindering production. They are introduced separately as follows:

　　　　　I. "Dead Division, Live Work" System

　　Based on the standards of load-bearing, mileage, and production performance, extra points are given for exceeding the specified standards, and more work points are calculated. For example, if a task that originally required two days or two trips is completed in one trip or one day, or if a task that originally required many people is completed by a few, more points are given. The calculation method is to first calculate the points according to the task. For example, transporting four *dou* of public grain is worth ten points, transporting fifty hand grenades is worth ten points, one stretcher is worth forty points, and generally carrying sixty *jin* of goods for sixty *li* is worth ten points. Those who exceed this standard are given extra points based on load-bearing and mileage, and those who do not meet the standard are deducted points. As long as one can carry more or run farther, one can earn twelve, fifteen, or even twenty-five points, with one person doing the work of two, saving labor for production. This not only inspired everyone's enthusiasm for attendance but also increased production efficiency.

　　　　II. Combining Production and Organizing Production to Support Logistics

　　In service, use opportunities to carry extra loads, so as not to return empty-handed. For example, Tian Jiaze from Tunliu sent cloth to Shimin and bought two hundred *jin* of tobacco leaves in Jincheng, earning more than one thousand *yang*. Gao Yunliang and others transported grain to Qinyuan and brought back pig iron to Changzhi on the return trip, earning 153,000 *yang*. Some even helped local people cultivate and engage in small-scale production in the war zone during rest periods. For example, a clerk from Wangwu participated in the war in southern Shanxi and took time to transport goods, earning money to improve everyone's lives. Another approach is the mutual aid group of villager Li Chengji from Dongshan, Yangcheng, which selected people suitable for attendance to specialize in logistics, while others specialized in production. The work points of attendance and the work points of the mutual aid group, as well as the profits earned from production and transportation, were fully calculated. After deducting costs and expenses, profits were distributed according to work points. In half a year of production, in addition to expenses, they also bought a donkey, solving the difficulties in farming, and achieving a combination of participation in the war, production, and transportation.

　　　　III. Voluntary Contracting System Under Accurate Calculation and Reasonable Organization

　　After determining the task, the number of required personnel was determined according to the load-bearing standard. However, under the method of accurate calculation and reasonable organization, civilian labor was promoted, the load-bearing capacity was increased, and the number of personnel required was reduced. People who should have attended but did not attend gave subsidies to those who actually attended. In Yuancun, Second District, Tunliu, a certain time when sending grain to Qinyuan and transporting cloth to Shexian, 63 vehicles were required. Using the above method, only 59 vehicles went, and the task was completed on time.

　　　　IV. Combining Logistics and Finance

　　Depending on different situations, different work departments, and tasks, accurately calculate to save civilian labor. When the First Administrative Office of the Special Commissioner's Office was stationed in Qinyuan and Anze for rest, a large amount of grain was needed to regulate life. It was planned to transport 1,500 *shi* of wheat and 1,500 *shi* of miscellaneous grains from Pingyao. Each trip was estimated to take three days, requiring a lot of civilian labor. In addition, the grain price in Pingyao was very expensive, and it was not cost-effective to transport it back. The Special Commissioner's Office consulted with the trade company and handed over the grain in Pingyao to the trade company, which paid for the grain in the area where the troops were stationed, thereby saving 12,750 units of civilian labor and over one million *jiao fei* in foot fees. Another approach: Zhaocheng allocated 150 *shi* of grain for the military region to purchase ammunition. It took half a day to transport it from Fancun, Zhaocheng, to Hongdong. The comrades of the finance section consulted with the troops and converted the payment into money, saving 1,500 units of civilian labor. However, the above methods should be carefully considered for changes in local prices when the quantity is too large, otherwise, it will promote price fluctuations.

　　　　V. Organ Cadres Taking the Initiative to Provide Logistics Services

　　Without affecting work, organ personnel personally provided logistics services, saving civilian labor. When the First Administrative Office of the Special Commissioner's Office moved at the end of March, many heavy items were completely transported by cadres, saving more than 130 units of civilian labor. In August, the Fourth Administrative Office of the Special Commissioner's Office held a conference of combat heroes. The entire preparation work (obtaining grain, carrying charcoal, borrowing furniture, and returning it after the meeting) was entirely done by cadres themselves, without using a single unit of civilian labor. Cadres of the Third Administrative Office returned from Yangcheng to the Third Sub-district. In addition to each person handling their own luggage, they also carried several hand grenades, saving 300 units of civilian labor and more than 600 *jin* of millet. Similar situations are quite common in other organs as well.

　　　　VI. Accurate Calculation of Round-Trip Logistics Services and the Savings Method of Breaking the Old Rules of Local Food Supply for Organs

　　(1) Accurate Calculation: This spring, when a certain unit was stationed in Qinyuan, it needed to purchase 600,000 *jin* of grass on behalf of the army. At first glance, it seemed difficult for a county to bear such a large number. However, after accurate calculations by the county heads of Qinyuan and other five counties, it was confirmed that one county could bear it, thus saving 900 vehicles. A certain unit in Tunliu wanted 900 donkeys to carry military supplies, each carrying 80 *jin*, and it also required a person to accompany each donkey, which was slow. At that time, everyone was busy plowing the fields. After research, it was flexibly changed to two people replacing one donkey, with each person carrying 60 *jin*, which was faster, and one donkey was much stronger than one person for plowing the fields. This not only allowed for more and faster transportation but also saved civilian labor.

　　(2) Round-Trip Logistics Services. During our army's ambush of the 61st Army, comrades Chen Xifan and Liu Zhiren from the Finance Section of Huo County mobilized a large number of people to transport colored flags up the mountain, while the grain on the mountain urgently needed to be transported down. They immediately went to mobilize the people to transport grain to cover the duty. The masses raised the difficulty of not having bags. The cadres found more than 100 bags to borrow overnight, resulting in the transport of 3,500 *jin* of grain, saving 288 units of civilian labor. In the participation in the war in southern Shanxi, individual counties created a combination of stretcher teams and transportation teams. When going to the front to transport supplies and ammunition to the troops, they carried the wounded on the return trip, which not only saved civilian labor but also reduced the suffering of the wounded.

　　(3) Organs breaking the old rules of local food supply. The warehouse in Yangcheng County needed to supply × *wan jin* of food to local organs and passing troops every month. However, there was little grain locally, and most of it had to be transferred from warehouses outside the city by mobilizing civilian labor on time. But from April, due to the conscious emphasis of the organs and troops, civilian labor was saved and they started transporting it themselves. For example, a certain organ allocated 15,000 *jin* of wheat, requiring 250 civilian laborers (two days for the round trip), totaling 500 work units, which was saved. If all organs could save in this way, it would be even more. Therefore, if the organ's food supply is relatively close to the warehouse, they should use their own efforts to organize and transport it, saving civilian labor and strengthening support for the front.

　　太岳节省民力的零星创造
    紧张的自卫战争一年中，确实使用了大批民力，在民力使用上也创造了不少办法，大体作到了既保证全力支援战争，又没有妨碍生产，现分别介绍如下：
    　　　　　一、死分活计制
    按负重、里程与生产成绩为标准，超过规定的标准便多计分，多算勤工。如本需两天或两次完成的勤务，一次或一天完成了，本需多数人完成的勤务，而少数人完成了，便多计分。计算办法，先照任务求出分数。如运四斗公粮顶十分，运五十颗手榴弹顶十分，一付担架顶四十分，一般东西负重六十斤走六十里顶十分，超过这种标准者按负重里程加分，不及者减分，只要能多担或跑的远，就能顶十二分，到十五分，甚至到廿五分，一人顶两个人用，省下劳力生产。这样既启发了大家出勤的积极性，又增加了生产效能。
    　　　　二、结合生产和组织生产以支应勤务
    在服勤中有捎带驮脚，以免空手回来。如屯留田加则往士敏送布回来，在晋城捎买了二百斤烟叶，赚洋一千余元，高云亮等往沁源运粮，返回时到长治拉回生铁，赚洋十五万三千元，还有的到作战地区，在休息时，帮助当地群众耕种，做小生产，如王屋事务员在晋南参战，抽闲运输，赚钱改善大家的生活；另一种作法，如阳城东山村民兵李称稷互助组，抽出适宜出勤的人专事出勤，其他的人专事生产，出勤的人闲时外出运输，勤分与互助组的工分，生产运输所赚红利满打满算，扣除成本费用，按工分红，在半年生产中，除开支外还买了一个驴，解决了耕作中的困难，做到参战生产运输相结合。
    　　　　三、精确计算，合理组织下的自愿包工制
    在确定任务后，按负重标准，决定了出勤数量，但在精确计算合理组织的办法下，发扬民力，提高负重量，减少出勤数字，应出勤而不出勤的人，给实出勤人津贴一定的钱。屯留二区原村，某次到沁源送粮，到涉县运布，须派车六十三辆，采用上述办法，只去了五十九辆，按时完成任务。
    　　　　四、服勤与财经相结合
    根据不同情况，不同的工作部门与任务，精确计算节省民力。一专署在我野战军驻扎沁源，安泽休整时，需大量粮食调剂生活，计划由平遥运一五○○石麦子，一五○○石花料，运一次以三天计，需民工很多，再加平遥粮价很贵，往回运不合算，专署与贸易公司商妥，将平遥的粮食交贸易公司，贸易公司在驻军食粮地区缴粮，由此节省民力一万二千七百五十个，脚费百余万元。另一种作法，如赵城拨给军区购买弹药粮一五○石，从赵城范村运至洪洞，往返半天，财政科同志与部队商酌，折付款子，节省民力一千五百个。不过上述办法，在数量过大之时，应慎重考虑各地物价之变化，否则会促成物价之波动。
    　　　　五、机关干部动手捎服勤务
    在不影响工作下，机关人员亲自服勤，节省了民力，一专署在三月底搬家时，许多笨重东西，完全由干部搬运，节省民力一百三十余个。四专署在八月间召开参战功臣大会，整个准备工作（搞粮，担炭，借用家具，会后归还。）完全是干部亲自动手，未用一个民力。三专署干部由阳城返三分区，除每个人搞自己的行装外，并附带捎手掷弹数个，节省民力三百个，小米六百余斤。类似此种情形，其他机关亦颇不少。
    　　　　六、精确计算往返服勤与机关打破就地食粮的节约办法
    （一）精确计算，今春某部驻扎沁源时，需代购草六十万斤，粗枝大叶的来看，一个县很难负担这样大的数目，后经沁源等五县县长的精确计算，才确知一个县可以负担，这样节省了车九百辆。屯留某部要毛驴九百头驮军用品，每头负重八十斤，还需配一个人，走的又慢，当时又忙于犁地，经过研究，很灵活的改为两个人替代一个毛驴，一个人担六十斤，走的又快，而且一个驴犁地比一个人强的多，既能多运快运，又省了民力。
    （二）往返服勤。霍县财政科陈希藩、刘志仁二同志，在我军伏击六十一军时，大批群众往山上转运彩号，而山上的粮食急待运下一部，当即前往动员群众运粮顶勤，群众提出没口袋的困难，干部星夜找借口袋一百余条，结果捎运粮三千五百斤，节省民力二百八十八个。在晋南参战中，个别县创造了担架队与运输队的结合形式，去前方运送部队的给养弹药返回时担架伤员，不仅节省了民力，并能减少了伤员的痛苦。
    （三）机关打破就地食粮的老规矩。阳城县仓库每月供给驻地机关与过路部队食粮需×万斤，可是当地粮食少，大部要从城外仓库按时动员民工转运，但由四月份开始，由于机关部队的自觉重视，节省民力自己起运。如某机关拨麦一万五千斤，需民工二百五十个（返往两日），计工五百个，便节省了，各机关均能如此节省，就更多了。所以机关食粮，若距仓库较近，即用自己动手，组织力量捎运，节省民力，加强支前。（太岳分社）
