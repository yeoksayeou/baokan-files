　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 16th: Liberated masses in various parts of Northeast China are enthusiastically joining the army and supporting the front. The people of Harbin City have once again launched a wave of enthusiasm for joining the army, which has not yet stopped. So far, 2,600 young people have flocked to the Democratic Allied Army. The Nangang District held a rally of over ten thousand people to send off the new recruits, and the masses proposed raising more than 30 million yuan to set up cooperatives to solve the livelihood difficulties of military families. The Changpu District stipulated five “no’s” in its review standards for army recruits: those with unclear histories will not be accepted; those who do not meet the age requirements will not be accepted; enemy and puppet remnants and targets of struggle will not be accepted; habitual bandits and Jianjun (Chiang bandit "underground army") will not be accepted; and those with infectious diseases will not be accepted. As a result, the number of recruits exceeded the original target by 70 percent.
