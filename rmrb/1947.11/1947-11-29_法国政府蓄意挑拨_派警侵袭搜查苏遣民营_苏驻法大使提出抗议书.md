　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th: Paris dispatch: On the afternoon of the 14th, the French government, in violation of the Franco-Soviet agreement on the repatriation of nationals, dispatched 2,000 French police, along with armored vehicles and tanks, to suddenly invade and conduct an unreasonable search of the Soviet repatriation camp in Bo Le Gar, near Paris. The pretext was to "find three children of a Soviet woman in the camp and send them to their father living in France." Soviet Ambassador to France, Bogomolov, formally lodged a protest on the 17th against this act of violence by the French government, denouncing the violation of the agreement and the provocative nature of the invasion. French democrats are also extremely indignant about this. On the 18th, the French Communist Party issued a communique stating: "This is part of a series of anti-Soviet activities by American imperialists and their agents." French Communist Party member Florimond Bonte, during questioning of Interior Minister Depreux in parliament, pointed out that the purpose of the French government's action was "to divert the French people's attention from armed fascist groups, which are organizing treasonous conspiracies with the connivance of the government's disastrous policies." Even newspapers that are not sympathetic to the Soviet Union believe that the French government's actions are paradoxical.

　　法国政府蓄意挑拨
  　派警侵袭搜查苏遣民营
    苏驻法大使提出抗议书
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】巴黎讯：十四日下午，法政府违反法苏关于遣送侨民问题的协定，派遣法警二千人，并出动装甲车与坦克，突然对巴黎附近之鲍·列加苏联遣民营举行侵袭与无理搜查。其借口是在营中“找寻一个苏联妇女的三个小孩，并把他们送交住在法国的父亲。”苏驻法大使鲍格莫洛夫已于十七日对法国此种暴行正式提出抗议书，指斥法政府的违约侵袭含有挑拨性质。法国民主人士对此也极为愤慨。十八日法共发表公报称：“这是美帝国主义者及其代理人的一连串反苏活动的一部分。”法共议员佛洛里蒙·邦氏，在议会中质询内政部长戴普里时指出：法政府此举目的，“在于转移法国人民对武装法西斯集团的注意，而这个集团正在政府祸国殃民政策的纵容下，组织叛国阴谋。”甚至一向不同情苏联的报纸也认为法政府的行动为悖谬者。
