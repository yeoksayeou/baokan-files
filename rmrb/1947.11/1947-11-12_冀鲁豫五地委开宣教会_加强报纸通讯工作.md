(Our newspaper's telegram from Jiluyu, 8th) The Fifth Prefectural Committee of Jiluyu held a propaganda and education conference, deciding to strengthen newspaper and communications work to reflect the true situation of the masses' struggle. Since the launch of guerrilla warfare, the Fifth Prefectural Committee convened its first propaganda and education conference on October 11th, with the main content being the establishment of departmental work to serve the central work. Currently, newspaper and communications work is the top priority. At the beginning of the meeting, Minister Liu of the Propaganda Department pointed out that in the past, we were "all doing and no saying," even self-proclaiming ourselves as "honest" and "burying our heads in hard work," etc. We should recognize that this is not a good style. The guerrilla war of the past year is worth writing about in detail. Things like tunnel construction, persisting in the three-month counter-"mopping-up" operations, and the enemy advancing while we advance are all valuable experiences, but we have not seriously summarized and reported on them to help the leadership and spread the experience. In the future, we should go from "all doing and no saying" to "doing and saying." Then, the counties reported that in the guerrilla environment, the Prefectural Committee and Heze, Kaocheng, Qibin, Fucheng, and Dingtao counties had established a total of seven small newspapers, persisting in publishing under the most difficult circumstances, with the mimeograph machines frequently going into hiding. This is worth promoting in the future. However, there is also a common shortcoming at present, namely, the lack of close integration with the central work. For example, when Dingtao, Qibin, and other counties started their newspapers, the Party committees all wrote articles, but after they were up and running, they relaxed their leadership, causing the newspapers to become purely about praising models, publishing whatever articles came in, lacking guidance, and not having high prestige among cadres and the masses. Finally, in his summary, Minister Liu pointed out that to truly ensure that everyone uses this weapon and that the whole Party runs the newspaper, the conference determined the policies of strengthening communications work and improving institutions based on this spirit. Organizationally, a Party newspaper committee was established to provide materials to each other and coordinate work, using this organizational guarantee to reflect the true situation of the rural masses' struggle and serve the current central work.

　　冀鲁豫五地委开宣教会
  　加强报纸通讯工作
    【本报冀鲁豫八日电】五地委开宣教会议，决定加强报纸通讯工作，反映群众斗争真实情况。自开展游击战以来，五地委会于十月十一日召开第一次宣教会议，主要内容为建立部门工作，以服务中心工作，在目前则以报纸通讯工作为首要一环。会议开始，宣传部刘部长指出过去是“光做不说”，还自命为“老老实实”，“埋头苦干”等，我们应认识这不是一种好作风。一年来的游击战争，是值得我们大写特写的，象地道建设，坚持三月反“扫荡”、敌进我进等，都是宝贵的经验，但我们没有认真进行总结与报导，以帮助领导，传播经验。今后应由——“光做不说”到“又做又说”。接着各县汇报，在游击环境中，地委会与菏泽、考城、齐滨、复程、定陶等县共建立了七个小报，在最困难的环境下，坚持出版，油印机经常钻地洞，这是值得今后发扬的。但在目前也普遍存在一个缺点，即与中心工作结合不密切。象定陶、齐滨等县，开始办报时党委都写了稿，但办起来以后即放松了领导，以致使报纸形成单纯表扬模范，来什么稿登什么稿，指导性不强，在干部与群众中威信不高。最后，刘部长在总结中指出真正做到大家来运用这一武器，做到全党办报，大会根据此精神，确定了加强通讯工作，健全机构等方针。在机构上，成立一党报委员会，以互相供给材料配合工作，以此组织保证反映农村群众斗争真实情况，服务当前中心工作。
