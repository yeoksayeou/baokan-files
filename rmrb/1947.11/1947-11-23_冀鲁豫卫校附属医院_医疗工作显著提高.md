    Significant Improvement in Medical Work

    [Report from our Jiluyu correspondent on the 21st] The medical work at the Health School Affiliated Hospital has significantly improved. With a high level of dedication to serving the wounded and sick, all comrades have enabled twenty-five wounded and sick comrades, who were struggling on the verge of death, to regain their health. Dai Lifu, the deputy platoon leader of the 26th Regiment, suffered a head injury from a bomb explosion, with a peach-sized piece of brain matter protruding. He was unconscious and unable to take food or water. After two rigorous sterilization surgeries, the protruding brain matter was removed, and sutures were performed. With patient care, he has now recovered. Militia member Ni Xinan suffered fractures of the ulna and radius in his upper limb due to a bomb explosion, resulting in gangrene and a high fever of 40 degrees Celsius. He developed septicemia, with profuse vomiting and blood leaking from the wound. On the third day of admission, a skillful amputation was performed. With careful nursing and treatment, he also recovered and was discharged. Duan Qinyu, a worker at a bomb factory, suffered burns all over his body from explosives, with half of his body burned. He was unconscious and had rapid, shallow breathing. Through patient subcutaneous and intravenous injections of one to two pounds of physiological saline solution daily, application of red mercury solution, and application of ＠amine ointment, and around-the-clock care, he is now close to recovery. Ren Xingyu, a soldier wounded in the Yangshan battle, had a skull defect larger than a copper coin. With patient care and treatment, he also recovered and was discharged. Comrade Cao Qingxiang, a soldier of the × Column, suffered a fractured abdominal bone and now has septicemia, but his condition has improved due to timely surgery. Kong Jilong, a platoon leader of the East China × Column, injured his knee joint, and a major artery was completely severed, resulting in massive bleeding twice. With careful care, local application of camphor oil, and injections of plasma, he was brought back from the brink of death. Comrade Zou Jiwu, a medical assistant suffering from acute meningitis, and others, have all recovered with patient care.
