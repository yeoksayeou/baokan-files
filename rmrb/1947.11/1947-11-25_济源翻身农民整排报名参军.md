(This article was transmitted by the Taiyue Bureau on the 23rd) The massive storm of "Join the People's Liberation Army, capture Chiang Kai-shek alive" in the Taiyue region has swept into Jiyuan. When the liberated peasants of Jiyuan discussed "Fighting to Nanjing and capturing Chiang Kai-shek alive," they enthusiastically signed up to join the People's Liberation Army. In the Miao Street base area, in nine administrative villages, when discussing supporting the great counter-offensive with all their strength, 415 people signed up. For example, Bai Shengfu, the instructor of Xiajie, and others, in order to capture Chiang Kai-shek alive, formed a platoon to sign up together and solemnly swore to everyone: "We will not return until we capture the bandit Chiang alive." Following this, Zhang Chunren, the instructor of Paizi Village, sent his son, nephew, and grandson to join the army. Old man Liu Jingshan said generously: "We were liberated by the Eighth Route Army, and now we need the Eighth Route Army to win the country. We must send our sons to join the Eighth Route Army and expand the Eighth Route Army." Women Shi Lianying and Yan Zhiying from Song Village both said in unison: "We will send our husbands to join the army, and we will also guarantee to lead all the women in the village to replace the men in labor and production." Thus, in the nine villages, except for Tutou Pan Village, each had a platoon of people enlisting. The young people of Chengguan Town more clearly stated: "Only if our young people continue to join the People's Liberation Army can we fight to Nanjing and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive." Yang Zhu immediately joined the army, and then 40 young people also scrambled to sign up. Currently, the liberated peasants throughout the county are enthusiastically signing up.
