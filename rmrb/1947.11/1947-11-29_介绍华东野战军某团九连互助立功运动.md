　　Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 27th. Zhao Yiya, Director of the Propaganda Department of the East China Field Army Political Department, recently wrote an article introducing the mutual aid and merit campaign of the Ninth Company of a certain regiment, stating: This time, more than half of the new recruits were added, but after 20 days, they quickly recovered and improved their combat effectiveness, and successfully completed the task of attacking Zhucheng. This was due to the promotion of a mass, conscious, and united mutual aid movement.

　　Mutual aid is not new in our army, but the mutual aid movement in the Ninth Company has many unique features and innovations. The first feature is that although this movement started with mutual aid between new and old soldiers, the masses infinitely enriched the content of the movement. From mutual aid in life and study, it developed into mutual aid in combat and ideology, so that everyone established the understanding that the mutual aid movement can be combined with all military and political work and can organize and promote all mass actions. The second feature is learning while fighting, which makes learning from war more concrete. This creation reflects two new styles of the Ninth Company: (1) Learning by doing has begun to become a trend among the masses. For example, when digging fortifications, they not only study how to dig, but also study how to use fortifications to fight the enemy. Therefore, once they enter the battle, they turn the original mobilization slogan "the battlefield is the examination room" into the action of "the battlefield is the classroom." (2) The change in command style, repeated discussions before the battle on how to lead new comrades to fight, and the implementation of the slogan that command should be specific during the battle. The third feature is ideological mutual aid. This is a new development of the mass line in ideological education. Because soldiers understand each other and have concrete common life experiences and emotional connections, they can easily communicate their thoughts with each other. Often a sentence is more effective than a lesson, and one-on-one teaching is more conducive to long-term and repeated persuasion. This is the best way to reform backward elements and an effective weapon to promote righteousness and change bad habits.

　　The Ninth Company unified mutual aid and merit, turning the merit evaluation committee into a mutual aid and merit committee. The grassroots organization combined with the combat team to become a combat mutual aid group. The result of mutual aid will inevitably be merit. Merit in turn promotes mutual aid. Some comrades believe that since there is a merit campaign, why have a mutual aid movement? The experience of the Ninth Company shows that the main point of the merit campaign lies in mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses and the exemplary role of active elements, while the mutual aid movement further promotes the enthusiasm of the masses and the leading role of active elements through the combat mutual aid group. Merit emphasizes individual action, while mutual aid emphasizes collective strength. Mutual aid has its unique effectiveness in solving the ideological and living problems of the masses, and in promoting military and political learning, reforming work style and command style. From the experience of the Ninth Company, we are sure that the unified mutual aid and merit campaign is the basic method for the company's political work to mobilize the masses.

　　Finally, experience proves that we must thoroughly get rid of dogmatism in military and political education, commandism in work methods, and warlordism in peacetime management and battlefield command in order to truly launch a mass mutual aid and merit campaign.

　　Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 27th. After the Ninth Company of a certain regiment replenished a large number of new recruits, the company headquarters, based on the new recruits' spontaneous request to learn from the old soldiers, organized mutual aid activities to enable the new comrades to quickly learn how to fight. They took the Seventh Squad as a typical example, and first proposed the call to formulate a mutual aid and merit plan in the Seventh Squad. Liu Yongbiao, the squad leader of the Seventh Squad, Wang Tongyi, a newly enlisted peasant who had been emancipated, and Zhang Zhongxi, a newly liberated soldier, all made plans, but it did not become a craze. Therefore, the company headquarters called a chat meeting of combat team leaders and old comrades to study the reasons why mutual aid was not working: (1) Insufficient group activities, I wait for you to teach me, you wait for me to learn. (2) Everyone just got together and is not familiar with each other, so they don't know what to help each other with first. (3) Some comrades saw the rice bags being distributed and thought they were going to march and fight again, and had no intention of helping each other. In response to these three ideological obstacles, everyone proposed solutions: (1) Launch a competition to improve initiative, with old comrades actively looking for new comrades to teach; (2) Comrades who are not familiar with each other should go back to hold meetings to introduce and chat; (3) First teach the new comrades how to fight.

　　After the Seventh Squad first broke through, the company headquarters immediately convened a meeting of all company combat team leaders and above, introduced the Seventh Squad's experience in overcoming ideological obstacles, and the company established a mutual aid and merit committee. The political commissar of the division also came to the company to participate in the meeting. On the spot, he also approved the request for everyone to learn whatever they wanted, pointing out that they did not have to mechanically follow the battalion and regimental plans. Then the Ninth Company's enthusiasm for learning and mutual aid became enthusiastic. For example, each group in the first platoon could not aim after dark, so the soldiers created a method of lighting a lamp to aim at the fire. Liberated soldiers Peng Qingcheng and Tang Shaolian studied how to attack the sub-fortress even while lying in bed. Many comrades braved the rain to learn how to dig fortifications and practice throwing grenades.

　　The mutual aid movement unfolded for six days. After each new soldier was taught early and late by the old comrades, and worked hard to practice, they generally learned eight skills: aiming, loading and unloading guns, firing commands, using terrain and terrain features, digging various fortifications, throwing grenades, air defense and artillery defense, and advancing actions. They also realized that there were six differences between attending classes and mutual aid: (1) One-on-one mutual aid is easier to go into depth than one teacher teaching hundreds of people in class. (2) Mutual aid teaches one action at a time, which is easier to remember than teaching a set of actions in class. (3) In mutual aid, you can ask questions again if you don't understand, but in class it is only explained once. (4) Mutual aid can be learned anytime and anywhere, regardless of eating or playing, while classes are only two hours a day. (5) Mutual aid is all soldiers teaching soldiers, without restraint, while in class, the leader is teaching, and the soldiers feel nervous and unnatural. (6) Mutual aid is slow talk and slow work, close distance, and understandable accent, while in class, the distance is far and the accent is not understandable. According to the new comrades' discussion, only one set of the eight skills was learned in the classroom.

　　When the combat order was issued, the company headquarters immediately put forward the slogan: "Going to the battlefield is like going to the examination room, test whether the learned skills are real or not." The entire company immediately transformed the enthusiasm for mutual learning and mutual aid into mutual aid and merit in combat. In the digging of fortifications, the liberated soldiers showed their skills, digging quickly, beautifully, and strongly. Therefore, everyone got up to learn from them, and taught them how to do the work, how to place the wood, how to repair the gun holes, and the old comrades also taught the new comrades how to fight when the enemy came from the east, how to fight when they came from the west, how to observe, and how to aim. The soldiers consciously launched a competition, and groups of them sat on their positions to discuss how to dig better than other groups. One group automatically dug a communication trench between three single shelters to facilitate mutual contact after the battle started. After the fortification was completed, the entire group was so happy that they clapped their hands and laughed because of their own creation. The photographer was busy taking pictures of them, and the company headquarters convened a meeting of combat team leaders and above to study several ways to lead and help new comrades in combat. The Seventh Squad convened a combat team joint meeting with creative significance. This meeting not only reviewed the combat morale, but also carried out combat mobilization, and also studied combat actions. In the fierce battle of Zhucheng, the Ninth Company shouldered an important task. One company controlled more than 20 houses, and fought for a day and a night at the forefront of the entire battalion's position. In the battle, all the new comrades unanimously used all the skills they had learned. Squad leaders and team leaders also patiently and specifically commanded, and no cadre lost their temper on the battlefield. They developed the daily mutual learning into a new combat style of "teaching while fighting, and learning while fighting" on the battlefield. For example, the Seventh Squad was the assault squad of the entire company. When passing through the breakthrough, the squad leader told two old soldiers to go in first, and told the new comrades to pay attention to watching them go in. He also pointed out: "Being able to pass through the breakthrough tightly sealed by the enemy's firepower is due to the low posture, the fierce action, and the ability to take advantage of the gaps in the enemy's firepower." Everyone followed suit and successfully rushed into the city.

　　In the past, mutual aid learned about positional warfare. After entering the city, the old soldiers and the squad leader immediately told everyone the essentials and methods of street fighting, how to use doors, how to use walls, how to search forward, how to shoot the enemy, and how to avoid bullets, shells, and bombs.

　　After the battle, the battalion's summary pointed out that the Ninth Company had always made rapid progress in the past. This time, although a large number of new comrades were added, the battle was fought very well. There are five important characteristics: (1) A squad of a certain regiment and the Ninth Company guarded a row of houses side by side. The enemy attacked the squad fiercely several times, and the squad retreated. The Ninth Company mobilely dispatched a squad to reinforce it and consolidate that position. (2) Even though the enemy launched a fierce counterattack, and the Ninth Company's rear was almost cut off, it remained unwavering. (3) Insist on mutual aid on the battlefield, and be able to teach while fighting and learn while fighting even under enemy aircraft and artillery. (4) In the battle, through the breakthrough, street fighting, seesaw, enemy counterattack, and support of friendly neighboring positions, only seven people in the entire company were wounded in one day and one night. (5) Due to the development of the mutual aid movement, the cadres' work style was reformed, and the combination of education, work, life, and combat was realized.

　　介绍华东野战军某团九连互助立功运动
    【新华社华东前线廿七日电】华东野战军政治部宣传部长赵易亚顷著文介绍某团九连的互助立功运动，略称：这回补充了过半的新战士，经过二十天的时间，却迅速恢复和提高了战斗力，圆满的完成了攻击诸城的任务。这是由于推展了群众自觉的团结互助运动。
    互助运动在我们队伍中并不是新事情，但是九连的互助运动却有许多特色和创造。第一个特色是这个运动虽然是从新老互助开始的，但是群众把运动的内容无限的丰富起来。从生活互助、学习互助发展到战斗互助、思想互助，使大家在认识上确立了互助运动可以和一切军政工作结合起来，可以组织推动一切群众性的行动。第二特色是边打边教，使以战教战具体化，这一个创造反映出九连的两种新作风：（一）边做边教边学已开始成为群众中的一种风气，例如在挖工事时不仅研究怎样挖，而且研究怎样利用工事打敌人，因此一投进战斗就把原来“战场是考场”的动员口号开展成为“战场是课堂”的行动。（二）指挥作风的改变，战前反复讨论如何带新同志去打仗，战斗中执行了指挥要具体的口号。第三个特色是思想互助，这是思想教育上群众路线的新发展，由于战士之间彼此了解，具体共同的生活体验与感情联系，因此他们容易互相打通思想，常常一句话比一堂课还有劲，而一个教一个更便于长期反复的说服，这是一种最好的改造落后分子的方法，也是发扬正气转变歪风的有效武器。
    九连把互助与立功统一起来，把评功委员会变成互助立功委员会，基层组织就和战斗小组结合成为战斗互助组。互助的结果必然会立功。立功又推动了互助。有些同志认为有了立功运动何必又来个互助运动？从九连的经验说明立功运动主要的在于发动群众的积极性和积极分子的模范作用，互助运动则进一步通过战斗互助小组把群众的积极性和积极分子的领导作用发挥起来。立功偏重个人作用，互助强调集体力量。在解决群众的思想问题、生活问题上，在推动军政学习改造工作作风与指挥作风上，互助更有它的独特效能。从九连的体验中，我们确认统一的互助立功运动是连队政治工作发动群众的基本方法。
    最后经验证明，必须彻底摆脱军政教育的教条主义，工作方法的命令主义，平时管理战场指挥上的军阀主义，才能真正展开群众性的互助立功运动。
    【新华社华东前线二十七日电】某团九连在补充了大批新战士之后，连部根据新战士自发的向老战士学习的要求，把互助活动组织起来，使新同志迅速学会打仗。并以七班为实验的典型，于是首先在七班提出了订立互助立功计划的号召。七班班长刘永标、新参军的翻身农民王同义、新解放战士张中喜都订了计划，但并未成为热潮，于是连部号召了战斗组长和老同志的漫谈会，研究出互助不起来的原因：（一）小组活动不够，我等你来教，你等我来学。（二）大家刚到一起不熟悉，不知先互助什么。（三）有些同志看见发米袋以为又要行军作战，无心互助。针对这三个思想障碍，大家提出了办法：（一）发动比赛提高自动性老同志积极找新同志教；（二）同志们不熟悉的回去开会介绍漫谈；（三）先教会新同志打仗。
    七班首先突破以后，连部即召集全连战斗小组长以上干部会议，介绍了七班排除思想障碍的经验，连里成立了互助立功委员会，师政治委员也来连里参加开会。当场又批准了大家爱学什么就学什么的要求，指出不一定机械的按照营团计划去学。接着九连的学习互助情绪就热烈起来，如一排各组因为天黑以后无法瞄准，战士们创造出点起灯来瞄火头的办法，解放战士彭清城、唐少连睡在床上还研究如何打子母堡。许多同志冒雨学挖工事，练习投弹。
    互助运动展开了六天。每个新战士在老同志早教晚教，自己苦修苦练之后，普遍学会了八套本领：瞄准、上卸枪、击发要令、利用地形地物、挖各种工事、打手榴弹、防空防炮、前进动作、并体会出上课与互助的不同点有六：（一）互助一个人教一个人比上课一个人教百余人容易深入。（二）互助一次教一个动作比上课一次教一套动作容易记住。（三）互助时不会可以再问，上课只讲一遍。（四）互助不论吃饭游戏随时随地可学，上课每天只有两个钟点。（五）互助都是战士教战士，无拘束，上课是首长上，战士心里觉得吃紧，不自然。（六）互助慢慢谈，慢慢做，离的近，口音懂，上课离的远，口音不懂。根据新同志的讨论八套本事中，只有一套是上课堂学会的。
    作战命令下达了，连部马上提出：“上战场好比上考场，试试学的本领真不真”的口号。全连同志即把互学互助热情转变为战斗中的互助立功，在挖工事中，解放战士大显身手，挖得迅速，漂亮，又坚固，于是大家起来向他们学习，就在做工事中教起来，怎样放木料，怎样修枪眼，老同志也教新同志敌人从东边来怎样打，从西边来怎样打，怎样观察，怎样瞄准，战士们自觉的发动比赛，一组一组的坐在自己的阵地上讨论如何比别的小组挖的更好，有一个小组自动在三个单掩体中间挖起一条交通沟，便于战斗打响后互相联系。工事挖成后全组因为自己的创造，乐得拍手大笑，摄影记者忙着给他们拍照，连部又召集了战斗组长以上的会议研究了带领与帮助新同志作战的几点办法，七班召集了富有创造意义的战斗小组联席会，这个会议既审查了战斗情绪又进行了战斗动员，又研究了战斗动作，在激烈的诸城之战中，九连担负了重要任务，一个连控制了二十多家房子，在全营阵地的最前沿打了一天一晚。在战斗中全体新同志一致把学的本领都用上了。班长、组长也做到耐心具体指挥，没有一个干部在战场上发脾气的。他们把日常的互助学习展开为战场上“边教边打、边打边学”的新战斗作风。例如七班是全连的突击班，在通过突破口时，班长叫两个老战士先进去，叫新同志注意看着进去。又指出：“能够通过敌人火力严密封锁的突破口，是由于姿势低，动作猛，善于趁敌火力间隙”，大家也就照样胜利的冲进城去。
    过去互助学的是阵地战，进城后老战士和班长马上把打巷战的要领和办法告诉大家怎样利用门，怎样利用墙，怎样搜索前进，怎样射击敌人，怎样避子弹、避炮弹和避炸弹。
    战斗结束后，营的总结中指出过去的九连一贯进步快，这次虽然补充了大批新同志，仗打得非常好。有五个重要的特点：（一）某团的一个班和九连并排守卫一排房子，敌人向该班猛攻数次，该班撤下去了。九连机动的派出一个班增援上去，巩固了那块阵地。（二）仅管敌人猛烈反冲锋，九连后路几乎被切断，仍毫不动摇。（三）在战场上坚持互助，在飞机大炮之下也能边打边教，边学边打。（四）战斗中，通过突破口，巷战、拉锯、敌人反冲锋、支持友邻阵地，一天一夜全连只有七个负伤。（五）由于互助运动的开展，改造了干部的作风，实行了教育、工作、生活、战斗的结合。
