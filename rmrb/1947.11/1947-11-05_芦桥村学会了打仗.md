Lushui Bridge Village Learned to Fight
　　
    Ye Feng
    
    Lushui Bridge Village, three miles east of Boai City, is carrying out the land reform movement very vigorously: "The work is fast, like lightning, and the momentum is fierce, like thunder." In less than two months, under the leadership of poor peasants like Liu Shangfu in their work movement, they proposed to defend their emancipated property and learned to fight.

    I. Catching a Female Spy
    
    The villagers all shouted: "If the dog bandits (referring to the Chiang bandits) come, we will have to give them a good taste!"
    
    However, there were still two "stubborn" militiamen, one named Liu Wenjiu and the other Liu Xiaotai, who were afraid to fight when they picked up their guns.
    
    Tonight, the two happened to meet while on sentry duty. Liu Shanglei narrowed his eyes and asked them with a smile:
    
    "Can you fight or not?"
    
    Liu Wenjiu lowered his head and said weakly, "No!"
    
    Shanglei continued to ask: "If the enemy gets close to you and wants to capture you alive, won't you resist?!"
    
    Liu Xiaotai lowered his head sharply and then raised it to say: "How can I not resist those dog bastards!"
    
    Shanglei laughed and said: "Okay, let's go! But be careful of those dog bastards!"
    
    Liu Wenjiu tightly gripped a rifle, Liu Xiaotai held the handle of a grenade in his right hand and touched the iron ball with his left. The two of them stood at the east end of the village. It was midnight, dark and gloomy. People couldn't be seen more than ten steps away. They could only hear rustling sounds from the cornfield in front. Liu Wenjiu was startled and immediately raised his gun to aim. Liu Xiaotai mustered his courage and asked, "Who is it?!" There was no response, only the rustling sound getting closer and closer. A figure flashed by. Liu Wenjiu became anxious, gritted his teeth, and with a "click," fired the first shot. Liu Xiaotai pulled the fuse, hardened his heart, and lunged forward, shouting, "Stop!" Liu Wenjiu followed suit. When they looked, it was a woman. He asked, "What are you doing?" The woman replied, "Preparing for war!" Liu Xiaotai said angrily, "Don't lie! We have organization for war preparations. What are you doing in the middle of the night?" Liu Wenjiu added, "Take her to the militia headquarters!"
    
    The two of them hopped and skipped, taking the woman happily to the militia headquarters. Inside the headquarters, an oil lamp was lit on a red lacquered table, and Liu Shanglei was still sitting at the table reading a book. The two militiamen rushed to report what had happened. He smiled and asked, "You're not afraid to be a spy, wearing such ragged clothes. You must be a poor person. All poor people are one family. If you did something 'bad,' confess and it will be okay." At first, the woman in rags didn't dare to speak. Shanglei kept persuading her, saying repeatedly, "It must be those dog bastards who forced you to come..." The woman finally lowered her head and slowly said, "My home is in the countryside. I went to the city five times to spy and went to Ximaying Shangtun twice. Each time I spy, they give me ten thousand yuan." After a short pause, she continued as if afraid: "There are twenty or thirty more people behind me." When Shanglei heard this, he immediately called out to the twenty or thirty militiamen lying in the headquarters to shoulder the "grinding stone cannon" and carry the landmines. They all rushed towards the east end of the village. Liu Wenjiu and Liu Xiaotai hurriedly found a thick hemp rope, tied up the female spy, and hung her from a beam. But they didn't tie it tight. They locked the door and went to chase after everyone.
    
    Liu Shanglei led the militiamen and ambushed at the village entrance. They waited until dawn, but they didn't see a single enemy. Everyone returned to the headquarters, all very angry. Some said, "We were fooled by the spy!" Others said, "Perhaps when Liu Wenjiu fired the shot, the enemy heard it and knew we were prepared, so they sneaked away!" Liu Wenjiu said triumphantly, "Those dog bandits are much weaker than us!" Liu Xiaotai said, "I was the one who caught the female spy first. Do you think I should be credited?" Liu Shanglei raised his face and laughed loudly, saying, "Good! You couldn't shoot before, but now you can. You didn't dare to resist before, but now you dare. Both of you deserve credit!" He raised his hand and gave a thumbs up. Everyone laughed and applauded.
    
    Everyone was laughing and talking as they returned to the militia headquarters. When they opened the door, they only saw a hemp rope hanging from the beam, but no sign of the female spy. They saw that a big hole had been broken in the window. Liu Wenjiu said, "We were polite to her, treating her as a poor person and one of our own, but the dog bastard ran away." Liu Shanglei said, "Don't worry. We have sentries at every major and minor intersection in the village. Can she grow wings and fly to the sky?!" Everyone said, "That's right! Quick, search!"
    
    The militiamen were like a swarm of bees leaving their hive, searching in different directions. Liu Shanglei climbed onto the roof and shouted in a thunderous voice: "Elders and youngsters, a female spy has escaped from the militia headquarters. She's a stranger, around thirty years old, wearing ragged clothes. Men, women, old and young, search quickly..." The whole village was mobilized, booming and rumbling, like celebrating a "bonfire." Some held red-tasseled spears, some grabbed broadswords, and others picked up wooden sticks to move.
    
    Three walls away from the militia headquarters, Liu Wenjiu's wife, holding a wooden stick, searched the animal pen and came out. Her seven- or eight-year-old child, holding a wooden knife, followed behind her. As soon as they entered the outhouse, they saw the female spy hiding inside. She shouted in a shrill voice, "Caught her!" and grabbed the female spy, refusing to let go. The child immediately ran to report to the militia headquarters.
    
    The courtyard was packed with people. Liu Wenjiu was furious. He took the bamboo pole from his wife and hit the female spy three times hard. He glared and said, "We were polite to you, recognizing you as a poor person and one of our own. You want to run away, determined to follow Jiang's whores to the end!" The female spy didn't say a word. Wenjiu's wife took the bamboo pole from her husband and started hitting her too. Everyone was afraid that she would be beaten to death, so they all said, "Send her to the district!"
    
    Liu Shanglei raised his arm and said, "Our whole village is working together, the more we do, the more energetic we become. Liu Wenjiu and Liu Xiaotai, those two 'stubborn' people, were the first to capture her. They didn't dare to shoot before, didn't dare to resist before, but now they've become brave!" Everyone applauded loudly.
    
    Amidst the applause, two timid people, Liu Xiaoyi and Liu Wanxing, who hadn't dared to join the militia before, rushed to say, "I want to join the militia!" Another round of applause erupted. Then everyone shouted, "Let's all resist together!" "Never let the Jiang bandits steal our things again!!"

    II. "Let's All Resist Together"
    
    That night, Liu Shanglei estimated, "Now that we've caught one of them, the dog bastards will definitely come to retaliate!" He discussed it with the village cadres, and all the young and middle-aged men gathered together, preparing all kinds of weapons. They placed two mobile sentries on the small path east of the village. If they detected anything, they would retreat, lay landmines on the road, and the militia would ambush in the cornfields on both sides of the road. They placed the thickest "grinding stone cannon" at the village entrance... Everything was planned and prepared. It was midnight again, extremely dark. The two mobile sentries in front ran back breathlessly to report: "The Chiang bandits are coming, about thirty of them." Liu Shanglei told one person to tell everyone else to prepare to resist!
    
    The young and middle-aged men and self-defense members on the edge of the village rolled up their sleeves, waving their guns and knives heroically. The members of the "cannon group" loaded a pound of gunpowder into the belly of that "grinding stone cannon" thicker than an arm. Someone, in a hurry, loaded another pound. Liu Wenjiu and the comrades of the "shooting group" lay on the ground, cocking their guns, their hearts pounding. Liu Xiaotai raised a grenade in his right hand, striking a pose like an eagle pouncing on a chick.
    
    The Chiang bandit army stumbled into the minefield. The explosion group, with quick eyes and hands, pulled the fuse, and with a "boom," a large red flower flew up.
    
    "Bang!" The grenade exploded, and the rifles "popped" and "popped."
    
    Like the sky falling and the earth collapsing, the "grinding stone cannon" roared with a "boom," burning half the sky red.
    
    The Chiang bandit army, scattering and shouting: "Oh no, this is bad, they have anti-tank guns, anti-tank guns..."
    
    Liu Shanglei tore his rough throat and shouted:
    
    "First company, charge!"
    
    "Second company, surround!"
    
    "Machine gun squad, move up!"
    
    "Resolutely annihilate the enemy!"
    
    All the young and middle-aged men shouted: "Capture them alive!" "Don't let one escape!" They chased them for more than a mile.
    
    The next day, as dawn broke, all the men, women, old and young in the village went to see. They saw the traces of the bandits falling in the field, and bloodstains on the road, dripping and dripping, scattered towards the east... Some said: "Even if one hundred and eighty more come, we won't let them steal a single chicken feather!" Some said: "Not to mention a few small Chiang bandits, bandits and thieves, even if the old Chiang bandit, that bad traitor, comes, we will resolutely annihilate him!"

    芦桥村学会了打仗
    叶枫
    博爱城东三里地芦桥村，土改运动进行得很猛烈：“干的快，象打闪，耳的凶，赛雷轰。”不到二个月，他们工作运动中，在贫农刘尚富等的领导下，提出了保卫翻身家产，学会打仗了。
    一、抓女特务
    村里人都嚷着：“狗猖子（指蒋匪）来，可要叫它好好尝一尝！”
    可是，还有二位“老板”（呆板之意）民兵，一个叫刘文九，一个是刘小台，拿起枪来，不敢打。
    今天黑夜，刚好两个遇在一起去放哨，刘尚雷眼睛一眯，笑着问他们：
    “到底会打不会？”
    刘文九低下脑瓜，稀松地说：“不会！”
    尚雷接住问：“要是敌人到身根，要捉你活的，你还不耳？！”
    刘小台猛一低，又抬起来说：“那会能不耳狗日的！”
    尚雷哈哈道：“中，走吧！可要小心狗日的！”
    刘文九紧紧握着一根步枪，刘小台右手捏着手榴弹柄，左手摸住铁蛋蛋，俩个人，站在村东头，天，半夜啦，黑塌塌，十几步外看不清人，只听前边玉茭地，沙啦沙啦响，刘文九一吃惊，立刻举起枪，瞄好准，刘小台壮一壮胆问了一声“谁？！”不见答应，只听沙沙啦啦声，越来越近，一条人影，闪过来了。刘文九心一急，咬咬牙根，裂裂嘴，“圪崩”一声，放了第一枪，刘小台，手拉着火线，心一硬，一个弓步耳过去了，接着大喊：“站住！”刘文九也跟着上去，一瞧，是个女人，他就问：“干啥？”这位女人答：“备战！”刘小台气急说：“不老实，咱们备战都有组织，你半夜三更干啥？”刘文九接住说“带她到民兵部队去！”
    俩个人一蹦一跳，带着那位女人，高高兴兴进了民兵部队。队部里，一张红漆桌上，点着一盏煤油灯，刘尚雷还坐在桌边看香，俩个民兵抢先报告了经过，他就笑着问：“你当探子也不怕呀，看你穿身烂布衫，一定是穷人，天下穷人一家人，你做了‘怕’事（坏事之意），坦白就中，”开头，这位穿破衫女人不敢说，尚雷左一说右一摆，反来复去说：“一定是狗日们逼着你来……”这个女人才低下头慢慢说出：“我家住农村，去城里探过五次，去西马营上屯探过二次，探一次，人家给一万元，”稍停一下她又象害怕似接着说：后面还有二三十人哩：“尚雷一听说就叫起躺在队部里二三十民兵，扛上‘圪鲁炮’抱上地雷，唿唿啦啦，都奔向村东去，刘文九和刘小台，急了找来一根粗麻绳，绑住女特务吊到梁上，可是没捆紧，锁住门，就去撵大家。
    刘尚雷带着民兵，在村口埋伏着，一直等到天发亮，不见一个敌人，大家返回队部去，都气极了，有的说：“上了特务当！”有的说：“恐怕是刘文九一打枪，敌人一听有准备，就偷跑了！”刘文九得意洋洋说：“狗猖子比咱稀松得多！”刘小台说：“女特务可是我先捉住的，大家说，该记功不该？”刘尚雷仰起脸，哈哈大笑说：“好！你不会打枪的，会打啦，不敢耳的，敢耳啦，俩个人都有功！”他举高手，伸起大姆指，大家都笑，都鼓巴掌。
    大家笑着讲着，回到民兵队部，开门一看，只见梁上悬一根麻绳，不见女特务影子，看着窗子打烂了一个大窟窿，刘文九说：“咱对她客气，她狗日的跑了。”刘尚雷说：“不怕，咱村大小路口都有岗哨，他能插上翅膀飞上天？！”大家都说：“对！快搜查！”
    民兵们象一群出窝蜂，你东我西，分头搜查女特务，刘尚雷爬到房顶上，撑起响雷般粗嗓子喊着：“老少爷儿们，民兵队部跑了女特务，外村人，三十上下，穿破衫，男女老少快搜查……”全村都动起来，轰轰隆隆，象闹“烘火”，有的拿着红缨枪，有的抓起大砍刀，也有提上木棍＠动起来。
    隔着民兵队部三堵墙，刘文九媳妇手执木棍，从牲口圈里搜查了一遍出来，她七八岁小孩拿把木刀，跟在屁股后头，一进茅房就看见女特务在里面藏着了，她尖起嗓子叫：“抓住啦”，一把拖住女特务不放，小孩马上跑到民兵队部报告。
    院里挤着满腾腾，刘文九气呼呼，从老婆手中拿过竹杆，狠狠的打了女特务三鞭，瞪起眼说：“我们对你客气，认你是穷人，跟咱一家人，你要跑，坚决要跟蒋娼子干到底！”女特务一点也不吭气，文九老婆从男人手中拿过竹杆，也动开手，大家又怕一下打死了不好，一齐说：“送到区上！”
    刘尚雷举起胳膊说：“咱全村一起干，越干越有劲，女特务是刘文九、刘小台，他俩‘老板’人先抓住的他俩过去不敢打枪，不敢耳，如今干出胆来了！”大家哗啦哗啦大鼓掌。
    掌声中，有两位胆小的，刘小一和刘万兴，过去不敢干民兵，他俩争先说：“我参加民兵！”哗哗啦啦又一阵大鼓掌，接着都喊：“大家一起耳”！“永不叫蒋贼抢走咱东西！！”
    二、“大家一起耳”
    当天晚上，刘尚雷估计：“咱抓住他一个人，狗日的一定要来报复！”他就跟村干部讨论好，青壮年都集合一起，准备好各色各样武器，村东那股小路上，前边放二个游动哨，一发觉情况往后撤，路上埋地雷，民兵埋伏路两旁玉交地里，将最粗那颗“圪鲁炮”，置在村口，……一切都计划好，都准备好。天又到半夜时分，黑得厉害，前边两个游动哨，气呼呼跑回来报告，报告：“蒋匪来了，约摸有三十来人。”刘尚雷叫一人传一人都准备耳吧！
    村边青壮年和自卫队员们，卷卷袖子，雄纠纠摇动着枪刀，“大炮组”组员们，将一斤火药，装进那个比胳膊粗的“圪鲁炮”肚里，不知道谁，急急忙忙又去装了一斤，刘文九和“射击组”同志们伏在地上，用手扳着枪机，心跳得扑通扑通，刘小台右手举起一颗手榴弹，摆了个老鹰扑小鸡姿势。
    蒋匪军，忽喳忽喳，走进地雷阵，爆炸组眼明手快，一拉火线，“轰”的一声，飞起一朵大红花。
    “统”，手榴弹爆炸啦，步枪“圪崩”“圪崩”的响。
    象塌天，又象崩开地，“圪鲁炮”吼叫了“轰隆”一声，烧红了半个天。
    蒋匪军，乱窜乱嚷：“啊哟，不好了，有战防炮，战防炮……”
    刘尚雷，撕开他的粗嗓子喊叫：
    “第一连冲锋！”
    “第二连包围！”
    “机枪班上去！”
    “坚决消灭敌人！”
    全体青壮年高叫着：“捉活的！”“不叫跑一个！”一直撵了一里多地。
    第二天，天将明，全村男女老少都去参观，见地里还留着匪军们倒下去的痕迹，路上还有血块，一滴一滴，朝东边洒去。……有的说：“再来一百八十个，也不叫抢走一根鸡毛！”有的说：“不用说是几个小蒋贼，土匪小偷，就是老蒋贼那个坏蛋汉奸来，也要坚决消灭他！”
