Doing a Winter's Work Equates to Half a Year
Zhehu's Winter Great Production Drive

[Report from our Xingtai office] In Zhehu Village, Ninth District, the autumn harvest on the highland was not abundant. Under the leadership of Yao Dezeng and Li Shunhua, on the fifteenth day of the ninth lunar month, the group leaders of the cadres held a meeting to study the direction of winter production. First, they assessed the year's harvest to identify the shortfall. During the discussion on how to make up for it, Yao Dezeng said, "Doing a winter's work is equivalent to half a year. If agriculture doesn't pay, side occupations will. Focus on improving the quality of textiles, engage in transportation to earn silver dollars, and buy grain to overcome the famine." Everyone said, "As long as we are not idle in winter, everyone will earn money. 'Cultivating two and resting one' will not be an empty slogan." Then, after considering the conditions, marketability, labor force, and number of days, a three-month winter compensation plan was drawn up: (1) A total of twelve groups will extract twenty-nine livestock and one hundred and thirty laborers to engage in transportation, which can earn one million silver dollars. (2) There are eleven small cooperatives, including three oil mills, one dyeing workshop, and one vinegar workshop, with a total capital of 670,000, which can earn one million; the large cooperative has a capital of 2.7 million, which can earn one million silver dollars. (3) The woodworking factory will make ten looms (15,000 each), three spinning machines (60,000 each), and repair fifty sets of shuttles (3,500 each), which can earn 500,000 silver dollars. (4) The cotton ginning factory will produce two sets of rollers and bows, ginning and batting 5,000 catties of cotton, which can earn 750,000 silver dollars. (5) This year, the village harvested 5,000 catties of cotton, and textile production can earn a total of 7.6 million. The total income is 11.85 million silver dollars, calculated at 4,000 yuan per dou of corn, which can buy 296 large dan of grain, which, in addition to compensating for "cultivating two and resting one," leaves a surplus of 26 dan. To facilitate winter transportation, it was decided to immediately repair the main road (30 li), and the slogan was: "Don't relax winter production, three grasps (grasp textiles, grasp transportation, grasp grain) and three goods (take good care of military families, repair roads well, weave cloth well) to make up for the shortfall." Yao Dezeng said, "Buying grain is like buying life, grasping grain is reassuring." Now he has gone to Xingtai City to buy 16,000 catties of rice, and mobilized mutual aid groups to buy 14 dan of grain in Shanxi. This year, the village does not need to contribute a single grain for the public grain. To develop the winter and spring textile movement, the cooperative has also bought 1,000 catties of cotton. Road repair has already begun, requiring about 3,000 workers, and the masses have great confidence in completing it. (Zhao Zhezhang)

[Report from our Pindgding office] Pindgding held a district head and branch secretary meeting on the 7th to review and summarize the three autumn harvest plans and winter production. The county completed the wheat sowing plan of 100,000 mu and more than 80% of the autumn plowing. In order to make up for the famine caused by the spring drought and autumn frost, the production plan for the two months of this winter was determined: (1) Carry out the winter textile movement and strive to complete 100,000 catties of native cloth. The coordination of thread and cloth in the new and old districts is the responsibility of the county federation of cooperatives and district and village cooperatives, and the method of exchanging flowers for thread and thread for cloth is adopted. In the new districts, the county federation of cooperatives organizes training in textile technology and helps solve the problems of tools and raw materials. (2) Organize a large amount of transportation, which should be started immediately, improve the management methods of coal kilns, and repair the main road. The county federation of cooperatives established a coal general station in Zanhuangcheng. This winter, it is estimated that 22 million catties of coal will be transported and sold, in exchange for 70,000 dan of grain. Along the main transportation road, stores must be renovated. (3) Organize the boiling of nitrate and soil nitrate ash. The price of ash is three catties of millet per dan, and children and women are organized to store ash (crop and tree leaf ash) in large quantities. (4) Implement financial consolidation to reduce the burden on the people. The property that has been cleared should be combined with the interests of the masses to organize production and strive for self-sufficiency in production. Pay attention to construction as you go through the process of cleaning up. The county's financial consolidation work is required to be completed by the end of December. (5) Implement frugality to overcome famine, continue to overcome the masses' idea of "eating up the autumn harvest," call on the masses to store grain, prevent famine next year, and pay attention to preserving wild vegetables to prevent waste. (6) Rectify cooperatives, require extensive organization of production, and provide solutions to difficulties in tools, raw materials, and capital. (Ting Dong, Xiao Yun, Ji Yuan)

　　干一冬顶半年
  　折户冬季大生产
    【本报邢台讯】九区折户村，高岗山地秋收欠丰，在姚德增、李顺花领导下，阴历九月十五日干部组长集会研究冬季生产方向。首先算年成，找出窟窿。在讨论弥补中，姚德增说：“干一冬天顶半年，农业不沾副业沾，抓纺织提质量，搞运输赚大洋，买成粮食渡灾荒”。大家说：“只要冬不闲，人人把钱赚，耕二余一不空喊”。接着经过想条件、想销路、算力量、算天数，订出冬三月弥补计划：（一）共十二个组抽二十九头畜力、一百卅个劳力搞运输，可赚洋一百万。（二）小型社十一个，内油坊三座、染坊醋坊各一座，共资金六十七万，可赚一百万；大社资金二百七十万，可赚洋一百万。（三）木工厂打织布机十架（每架一万五），打纺线机三架（六万一架），修梭匣快梭五十套（每套三千五），可赚五十万。（四）花坊轧机风弓各两架，连轧带弹出五千斤花，可赚洋七十五万元。（五）今年全村收花五千斤，纺织共可收入七百六十万。总共收入洋一千一百八十五万元，每斗玉茭四千元计，可买二百九十六大石，除补耕二余一外，还余二十六石。为便利冬季运输，决定马上修大路（卅里），提出口号是：“冬季生产不放松，三抓（抓纺织抓运输抓粮食）三好（军属照顾好路修好布织好）补窟窿”。姚德增说：“买粮如买命，抓住粮食才放心。”现在他已到邢市买米一万六千斤，又动员互助组到山西买粮十四石，今年全村反攻粮不用从村出一粒。为开展今冬明春纺织运动，合作社又买棉花一千斤，现在修路已经动手，约需三千工，群众完成信心很大。（赵增章）
    【本报平定讯】平定于七号开区长分书会议检查总结三秋计划冬季生产。全县完成种麦计划十万亩及百分之八十以上的秋垡地。为了补足春旱秋霜造成的灾荒，确定今冬二个月的生产计划：（一）开展冬季纺织运动，为完成十万斤土布而奋斗。新老区线布的调剂由县联社组织区村联社负责，采取花换线、线换布的办法，新区由县联社组织训练纺织技术，工具原料问题帮助解决。（二）大量组织运输，应即着手，改善煤窑经营办法，修通大路。县联社在赞皇城成立煤炭总站，今冬估计运销二千二百万斤炭，换回粮食七万石。沿运输大路上，要改造店房。（三）组织熬硝土硝灰，灰价每担小米三斤，大量组织儿童妇女屯灰（庄稼树叶灰）。（四）贯澈整财减轻民负，已经清理出来的财产，应即结合群众利益，组织生产，争取生产自给。注意随清随理进行建设。全县的整财工作要求十二月底完成。（五）贯澈节约渡荒，继续克服群众收不收吃一秋的思想，号召群众存粮，防止下年灾荒，注意保存野菜防止浪费。（六）整顿合作社，要求广泛的组织生产，并在工具原料资本等困难上，给予解决。（庭栋、效云、计元）
