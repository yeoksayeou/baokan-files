Leningrad Dispatch

The Soviet People's Conscious Attitude Towards Work

　　Molotov pointed out in his speech on the October Revolution Day this year: "The Soviet people have a new spiritual structure, which is primarily manifested in their conscious attitude towards work, regarding their work as a matter of great social significance, and as a sacred duty to the Soviet state. The scale and content of the socialist competition today is enough to show that the Soviet people's attitude towards work has reached the level of communism. A new movement is now prevailing, that is, every worker guarantees to complete their annual production plan and the entire five-year plan ahead of schedule, which was unseen before the war." The example of the Kirov factory can illustrate this point. The Kirov factory is the leader in the machine manufacturing industry in Leningrad and the entire Soviet Union; it was one of the first initiators in this socialist competition to greet the October Revolution Day. In the competition, it created many new examples and maintained the continuous improvement of production levels. Not only individuals, but also entire groups, teams, and departments created new records, completing the entire monthly, quarterly, and annual plans ahead of schedule. A Stakhanovite worker named Solokin was the first to complete the entire 1947 annual plan in eighty-two days, and thus became famous throughout the city.

　　Many workshops have a type of statistical table hanging, from which you can see the standard and progress of each worker in completing their annual plan. If in the past the focus was on the worker's daily output, now the focus is on the annual output, and it is stipulated when to improve technology to what extent, how many new workers to train, and what technology to teach them, which is very comprehensive and specific. For example, a worker named Leonovich has a personal competition plan like this: (1) Complete this year's annual plan by July 1; (2) Teach Comrade Bilaskov his experience so that he can complete the annual plan before November 1, and teach him grinding techniques before July 1 to promote him from a fourth-grade worker to a fifth-grade worker; (3) Before November 7, propose two rationalization proposals for production.

　　There is a tool group with a total of three hundred and thirty workers, of which only sixty-four are skilled cadres, and the rest are novices. The production records of many novices fluctuate and rise and fall irregularly. Later, these sixty-four cadres responded to the call of the group leader and the party负责人, each leading three or four new workers, thus creating sixty-four Stakhanov schools. As a result, production increased by 10% in April. The achievements of workers in learning technology and the progress of rationalization ideas are reflected in the following figures: Last year, workers throughout the factory put forward a total of 270 rationalization proposals, while in the first three months of this year, there have already been as many as 300.

  　苏联人民对工作的自觉态度
    莫洛托夫在今年十月革命节的演说中指出：“苏联人民已具有新的精神结构，首先就表现在对工作的自觉态度，把他们的工作看作具有重大社会意义的事情，看作对苏维埃国家的神圣职责。今天社会主义竞赛的规模和内容，足以表明苏维埃人民对待工作的态度已经达到了共产主义的水平。现在已经盛行一种新的运动，这就是：每个工人都保证要提前完成他们的每年生产计划以及整个的五年计划，这是战前所未见的。”基洛夫工厂的实例可以说明这段话。基洛夫工厂是列宁格勒和全苏机器制造业的领袖；它在这一次号召迎接十月革命节的社会主义竞赛中，是第一批发起人之一。在竞赛中，它创造许多新的范例，保持着生产水平的不断提高。不仅个人，而且整组整队整部门都创造了新纪录，提前完成全月全季全年计划。有一个斯达汉诺夫工人索洛金，首先在八十二天中完成了一九四七年全年计划，因而名闻全城。
    许多车间都挂着一种统计表，从表上可以看出每个工人完成其全年计划的标准与进度。如果说过去着重的是工人当天的生产量，现在则着重全年的生产量，并且规定到什么时候提高技术到什么程度，培养多少新的工人，教给他们什么技术，非常全面而具体。例如：有一个工人叫做列昂多维奇，他的个人竞赛计划是这样的：（一）到七月一日完成今年全年计划；（二）把经验教给比拉斯可夫同志，使他于十一月一日前完成全年计划，到七月一日前教会他琢磨技术，使他从第四级工人提升为第五级工人；（三）十一月七日之前，提出两个生产合理化的意见。
    有一个工具组，一共有三百三十个工人，其中只有六十四个熟练干部，其余都是生手。很多生手的生产纪录是波动而升降不定的。后来，这六十四个干部，响应了组长和党负责人的号召，每人带领三四个新工人，这样就造成了六十四个斯达汉诺夫学校。结果，在四月份中提高生产百分之十。工人学习技术的成就和合理化思想的进展，表现在如下的数字中：去年全厂工人提出的合理化意见共二百七十件，而今年头三个月已多至三百件。（新华社陕北电）
