　　【Report from Jinnan, November 17th】 Zhendong loans 17 million to help poor farmers in disaster areas with sideline production to overcome famine; it is planned to start on November 5th and be completely loaned to farmers by the end of the month. This year, the county has not had a thorough rain, especially in the western half of the third district, where the autumn harvest is less than one-third of previous years. For example, when Taoyuan Village rushed to plant, the soybeans that were sown withered. Furthermore, because the land is mostly alkaline, rain makes it even worse. The soil in the first and second districts is sandy, and the harvest is relatively better, but the grain harvest is not enough to eat. Therefore, the government changed the previous method of evenly distributing loans and decided to focus on lending, with the third district, which is severely affected by the disaster, as the key area for loans. Ten million yuan is allocated to the third district, four million yuan to the second district, and three million yuan to the first district. Furthermore, key villages are identified in each district, and the villages select key households (mainly newly turned-over farmers engaged in small businesses) to ensure that the loans are distributed reasonably to the farmers. Currently, comrades from the bank are going to the countryside to conduct investigations to ensure that the loans are successfully distributed.
    【Report from Jinnan, November 17th】 The mutual aid teams organized in Ganji Town, Weixian County, during the autumn harvest and wheat planting, in order to continue mutual assistance in the long term and to prevent spring famine next year, emphasized the development of sideline production. After mobilization, the masses, based on the harvest compared to previous years and specific calculations, felt that they must do a good job in sideline production to overcome the spring famine next year, which cleared their minds. For example, Zhang Zhilu and Zhang Zhenting said in a forum of three mutual aid teams: "Our groups can select a few people to engage in sideline production and open a flour mill. This will not delay work and can earn money. Doing a business is better than being idle." Immediately, shares were purchased with mung beans, totaling thirty-five households, each share worth ten thousand yuan (several families can pool one share), raising a total of 180,000 yuan, and the flour mill was established. Six people were selected from the three mutual aid teams to manage it, and the work of these six people was done by everyone, and the money earned was shared by everyone. They plan to accumulate 120 cartloads of fertilizer, which can fertilize 40 mu of land. After such calculations, everyone's enthusiasm was very high, and they all said: "Being idle is also being idle, earning something is better than nothing, otherwise, we won't be able to afford to buy manure when the new grain is not yet available." In addition, five groups established woodworking workshops, three groups established three spinning wheel workshops, and two groups established grinding mills; two groups went to Linqing to push carts, and one group went to Qizhou to push bowls. Sixteen of the thirty-two mutual aid teams in the town have already started sideline production.

　　振堂贷款千七百万
    扶助灾区贫农渡荒
    【本报冀南十七日电】振堂贷款千七百万，扶助灾区贫农副业生产渡荒；准备于十一月五号开始，到月底完全贷到农民手里。该县今年一向未下透雨，尤其三区西半部，秋收不及往年三分之一。如桃园村抢种时，撒的菜豆枯死了。再因地多碱性，下雨便更糟糕。一、二区地质沙性大，收成比较还好些，但收粮也不够吃。因此政府一改以往平均分配的贷款办法，确定有重点的贷，以灾荒严重的三区为贷款重点，三区一千万元，二区四百万元，一区三百万元。再在各区当中找重点村，村由群众找重点户（主要作小本经营的新翻身农民），为了更合理的贷到农民手里。现在银行各同志都下乡作调查工作，以便把款顺利的贷下去。
    【本报冀南十七日电】威县干集镇在秋收种麦中组织起来的互助组，为了长期互助下去，同时为防备明年春荒，强调提出搞副业。经过动员，群众从比往年收成和具体算账中，感到必须好好搞副业，才能渡过明年春荒，打通了思想。如张之路、张振廷在三个互助组座谈酝酿中说：“咱们这几个组，可以抽出几个人来搞副业，开粉坊，这样耽误不了活，又能赚钱。做个买卖就比闲着强。”随即入股入绿豆，共三十五家，每一股一万元（几家可凑一个股），共集股十八万元，把粉坊成立起来了。从三个互助组里抽出六个人来经营，这六个人的活由大家来作，赚了钱，由大家来分。他们计划积肥一百二十车，能上四十亩地。经过这样算账后，大家情绪很高，都说：“闲着也是闲着，赚一个是一个，要不明年青黄不接的时候，买粪也买不起呀。”另外有五个组成立了木作坊，三个组成立了三个洋弓坊，两个组成立了轧坊；去临清推临两个组，去曲周推碗一个组。全镇三十二个互助组，已开始副业生产者十六个组。
