　　Trembling Luoyang
　　When the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yellow River, the Chiang bandits in Luoyang were extremely terrified. Starting from August 23rd, they hastily conscripted over ten thousand civilians to rush the construction of city defense works, and extorted two burlap sacks from each household in the city to block the city gates. From that day on, Luoyang was placed under curfew at 7:00 PM. A communication from the Kuomintang's local news agency, "Central News Agency," wrote: In early September, "Sandbags were piled inside the (Luoyang) city gates, and pillboxes were built at the intersections of the streets, indicating that Luoyang was ready for street fighting at any time." Local tyrants and evil gentry around Luoyang fled into the city with boxes and luggage containing their wealth, while the families of Chiang's servants in the city fled to Kaifeng and Zhengzhou like homeless dogs.
　　When the People's Liberation Army repeatedly reported victories at Tiemen, Yiyang, and Hancheng in early October, capturing seven county towns in a row, and a part of our army approached the suburbs of Luoyang, Luoyang became even more frightened. The price of gold rose from more than 2 million yuan per tael before our army crossed the river to more than 4 million yuan. The division headquarters of the 206th Division, starting with the division commander Xiao Jin, searched everywhere for plainclothes to prepare for escape. Xiao Jin even ordered preparations to burn down the Xiguan area. The Second Battalion of the Second Regiment of the Chiang bandits' Youth Army was sent to "defend to the death" Xiguan. When the battalion commander received the order, he said with tears in his eyes, "We are all going to die." This battalion was then completely annihilated by the People's Liberation Army in the Battle of Qilihe.
　　When the people saw the Chiang family bandits panicking and losing their composure, everyone was secretly happy. The Chiang bandits themselves also knew that the people hated them. Tang Yao Chen, the lieutenant adjutant of the Second Battalion of the Second Regiment of the Chiang-registered Youth Army, who was captured in the Battle of Qilihe, said: "When we left Zhougong Temple for Qilihe on October 9th, we couldn't find a single old person after passing Shansan Village, which is about fifteen miles away from Luoyang. The next day, the battalion commander asked me to go to Liuying Town in Xigong to find people to carry the wounded soldiers, but the township head and the people had all run away." Xiao Jin also admitted when speaking to the Youth Army on October 7: "The people of Luoyang do not welcome us (referring to the Chiang army)." (Xinhua News Agency, Yu-Shaan dispatch, 16th)

　　颤栗的洛阳
    当人民解放军一过黄河，洛阳蒋匪就极为恐慌。八月二十三日起仓惶征集万余民夫，赶修城防工事，并向市民每家勒索两只麻袋，以堵城门。当日起洛阳下午七点钟就戒严。国民党的地方通讯社“中央社”的一篇通讯里写着：九月初，“沙包堆在（洛阳的）城门里，十字街口均修有碉堡，显然洛阳已随时准备巷战。”洛阳周围的土劣奸霸带着箱笼财物纷纷往城里逃；而城里蒋家臣仆的眷属却急如丧家犬，逃到开封郑州去。
    当十月初解放军于铁门、宜阳、韩城连传捷音，连克七座县城，我军一部并逼近洛阳城郊时，洛阳更趋惶恐。金价自我军渡河前的二百多万一两涨到四百多万。二○六师师部从师长萧劲起都到处搜寻便衣，准备逃跑。萧劲且曾下令准备把西关烧光。蒋匪青年军二团二营被派去“死守”西关，营长接到命令时，流着眼泪说：“我们都要死了。”这个营随即在七里河战斗中被人民解放军全部歼灭。
    人民看到蒋家匪徒们恐慌失措时，个个心里都暗暗高兴。蒋匪自己也知道人民是憎恨他们的。七里河之战被俘蒋记青年军二团二营中尉副官唐尧臣说：“十月九号我们由周公庙开往七里河时，经过离洛阳约十五里的山三村，就找不到一个老百姓。第二天，营长叫我去西工柳营镇找人抬伤兵，乡长和老百姓全部跑光了。十月七日萧劲对青年军讲话时亦供认：“洛阳的民众不欢迎我们（指蒋军）。”（新华社豫陕十六日电）
