    [This dispatch from our Taiyue correspondent on the 4th] Since Yangcheng County announced reward measures for the autumn plowing campaign, it has become even more fervent and intense. Twenty-eight administrative villages in the Fourth District have organized 2,200 head of livestock for autumn plowing. Starting on October 19th, in just six days, according to statistics from two joint villages, 3,396 mu were plowed. The Xiaozhuang Hetaopo Yuan Xiaochao mutual aid team in the Sixth District, with seventeen head of livestock, plowed 39.5 mu of autumn land for military dependents and militia on rotation on October 20th alone. Now, districts and villages are challenging each other, guaranteeing the early completion of autumn plowing. At a meeting of village cadres in the Fourth District's Sihou Village on the 28th, Comrade Ji Zhixing challenged the first, second, third, and fifth joint villages, saying: "Our joint village has 15,940 mu of autumn land and 441 head of livestock, averaging 20 mu per head. We guarantee to finish plowing by the fifth day of the tenth lunar month. Who dares to compete with us?" Subsequently, cadres from the first, second, third, and fifth joint villages responded enthusiastically. The district made a silk banner to encourage everyone to seize it. Women in Jiangli Village in the First District are challenging each other. Yuan Xiaohe, the women's group leader in Tumeng, guarantees that the women in her village will plow 200 mu. Ru Xiaomei, the women's group leader in Wangping, guarantees that the women in her village will plow 192 mu. Guo Xiaohe, the women's group leader in Nanjin Village, guarantees to plow 100 mu, and Wu Nengcui alone guarantees to plow 30 mu. Each village has specific autumn plowing plans and measures, such as the seven autumn plowing measures in Jiangli Village: (1) Plow while harvesting, take care of livestock, and the village office will not issue transportation passes during autumn plowing. (2) Plow but do not harrow slopes and ridges to preserve winter snow. (3) Mutual aid team leaders should train skilled women to plow. (4) Let women use the old oxen and women plow large plots of land. (5) Each group should select experienced old men to guide the plows. (6) First plow for military dependents and those participating in the war, then plow for oneself. (7) First plow distant land, then plow nearby land; first plow shaded slopes, then plow sunny slopes.

    [This dispatch from our Taiyue correspondent on the 4th] In Qin County's "Seize the Autumn Campaign," men and women throughout the county are locking their doors and going to the fields, working hard. Women and children are being organized on a large scale, and scientific accounting of work points and division of labor are being implemented to arrange life, so that the county's autumn harvest is quickly completed. Now, autumn sowing and autumn plowing are being stepped up.
