Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. According to a Taiwan dispatch recently published in the Hong Kong "The Masses" weekly: American imperialism has thoroughly controlled Taiwan's economy. Since Wei Daoming took office, Taiwan has been filled with pot-bellied American businessmen. Brand-new Ford and Dodge cars sped along the smooth highways. American business houses and manufacturers have successively established branches or offices in Taiwan. American compradores are becoming increasingly active, and the market is piled high with American goods. American capital has entered all important industrial sectors in Taiwan. The Taiwan Sugar Corporation has been rebuilt with American technology and equipment. The Far East's largest Kaohsiung Aluminum Factory is also being rebuilt under American guidance. When Wedemeyer "inspected" Taiwan in August of this year, he convened a secret meeting with Chiang's Taiwan provincial government, the secretary-general, heads of various departments and bureaus, and the top ten companies of the Resources Committee, and ordered them to hold separate meetings on the economy, industry and mining, and general administration to study concrete plans for American control of Taiwan's economy. Since then, American economic power in Taiwan has become even stronger. Wedemeyer also instructed on the steps to suppress the Taiwanese people's movement. American secret agents are now actively carrying out their work in Taiwan, which is known to many American intellectuals and administrators. American imperialism is also using the Japanese as powerful assistants to control Taiwan. The Japanese began to return to Taiwan in early July. At that time, two Japanese ships arrived, one said to be carrying Japanese troops and the other Japanese "special immigrants." The first batch to arrive in Taiwan were the henchmen who had slaughtered the Taiwanese people in the past, including Hasegawa Kiyoshi, the former Japanese Governor-General of Taiwan, Ayukawa Gisuke, the former president of the Manchurian Heavy Industries Development Corporation and other Japanese military, political and cultural personnel.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. The U.S. imperialist military advisory group in China is actively participating in the work of training Chiang's army in Taiwan. In a statement on the 1st, the American Embassy in Nanjing openly admitted that "a small team" of the American military advisory group will go to Taiwan "to propose training methods in the infantry training camp established in Taiwan." The American Embassy shamelessly declared this sinful act of training Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops to prolong the civil war and slaughter the Chinese people as "the normal advisory work of the US military advisory group."

    台湾竟成美国天下
    经济权益全入美人之手
    美国秘密特务到处活动
    【新华社陕北四日电】据香港“群众”周刊近载台湾通讯称：美帝国主义已彻底控制了台湾的经济。自魏道明上台后，台湾便充满了大腹便便的美国商人，崭新的福特、道奇汽车，驰骋在平坦畅通的公路上，美国商号厂家纷纷在台设立分行或办事处，美国买办日渐活跃，市场美货堆积如山。美国资本已进入台湾一切重要工业部门，台湾糖业公司已以美国技术器材重远建，远东最大的高雄制铝工厂，亦在美国指导下重建。今年八月魏德迈“视察”台湾时，曾召开蒋家台省官府、秘书长、各厅处局长及资源委员会十大公司的秘密会议，并令他们分别举行了经济、工矿及一般行政的会议，研究美国控制台湾经济的具体方案。从此美国在台经济势力更加强大起来。魏德迈且曾指示了镇压台湾人民运动的步骤，美国秘密特务，现在在台湾积极展开工作，此为众多美国知识分子及行政官吏所知晓。美帝国主义且利用日本人为其控制台湾的有力助手。七月初日本人便开始回到台湾，当时开来两艘日本船，一说载来日军，一说是日本“特别移民”。第一批到达台湾的是当年宰割台湾人民的鹰犬，包括前台湾日本总督长谷川清，前满洲重工业会社总裁日本财阀鲇川义介与其他日本军政文化人员。
    【新华社陕北四日电】美帝国主义驻华军事顾问团正积极参加在台湾训练蒋军工作。南京美国大使馆于一日声明中已明白供认美国军事顾问团“一小队”将往台湾“俾在台湾建立之步兵训练营中提出训练之方法”。美国大使馆竟将此项训练蒋匪军队延长屠杀中国人民内战的罪恶行为，无耻地宣称为“美军顾问团之正常顾问工作”。
