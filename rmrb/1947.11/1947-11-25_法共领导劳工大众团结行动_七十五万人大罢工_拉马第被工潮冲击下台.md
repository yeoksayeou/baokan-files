Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: According to Agence France-Presse and other Paris reports: The French Communist Party issued an "Open Letter to Compatriots, Male and Female" on the evening of the 20th, stating: The government of tomorrow is preparing to strike at workers and the people of the whole country. Such a government, if it suits the wishes of American imperialism, will not conform to the will and needs of France. France needs a democratic government in which the Communist Party must at least play a leading role. The declaration called on: "Labor masses, unite and act!" and urged the organization of committees in various places to defend the Republic, defend workers and peasants, and defend national independence.
[Comprehensive Xinhua News Agency dispatches from the 19th to the 23rd] Reports from various sources: French workers continue their heroic struggle against the reactionary measures of the Socialist Party authorities attacking the working class, striving for guaranteed living conditions. The general strike that began in Marseille on the 12th is expanding daily. As of the 21st, the labor unrest had swept the country, and the number of strikers had reached 750,000. The righteous actions of the Marseille workers have not only received sympathetic strike support from the working classes of Nice, Toulon, and the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region, but have also been supported by American sailors on the American merchant ship Henry Cowell Costin, which had just arrived in port. According to a United Press report on the 18th, American sailors on the ship, after striking, stated to the French workers: We have decided to support the French strikers because American workers, like the French people, are fighting against anti-labor laws such as the Taft-Hartley Act, against high living costs and poor housing. The statement further stated: We also support your heroic struggle against the Marshall Imperialism Plan. The De Gaulle faction authorities in Marseille, under the orders of the Ramadier government, arrested workers in large numbers, and used French and Moroccan troops to guard government buildings and unload cargo from ships anchored in port due to the strike, in an attempt to undermine the strike. The workers not only protested against this reactionary measure, but also warned Ramadier that they would deal with the destructive actions of the Socialist Party government with a general strike of all French seamen. Also: The two teams of security guards sent by the De Gaulle faction mayor to the Sausset-les-Pins area to suppress the strike were disbanded because they sympathized with the strike, which also aroused protests from the Marseille General Confederation of Labor.
　　The strike of nearly 300,000 metalworkers in the Paris area has brought the automobile and aviation industries to a standstill. Nearly all of the 114,000 coal miners in the northern departments of Nord and Pas-de-Calais have also gone on strike, closing the mines in the area. The number of strikers in the Marseille area has surged to 100,000, and under the call of the Marseille dockworkers, all ports in the French Mediterranean have become dead ports. Dockworkers in the port of Bordeaux on the Atlantic coast also refused to load and unload cargo at the request of Marseille stevedores. At the same time, construction workers in the northern department of Aisne also went on strike. The strike of flour mill workers in Paris has spread to Lille in the north and Marseille and other small towns in the south, forcing bakeries in these areas to close. Employees of movie theaters and waterworks in Nice and 8,000 employees of the Toulon arsenal also went on strike on the 18th. According to an AFP report on the 19th, the General Confederation of Labor has ordered all trade unions to demand an increase of 3,800 francs (approximately US$31 or more) in the monthly minimum wage, and an increase of 25 percent in wages before negotiations are concluded.
　　Ignoring the reactionary government's armed suppression, workers have occupied factories and organized strike committees in various places. By the 21st, in addition to Paris, Bordeaux, and other places where strikes had already occurred, the movement was continuing to deepen, and miners in the Hérault and Rhône departments, as well as miners in the southern coalfields, had risen up to join the strikes in the Nord and Pas-de-Calais departments. Marseille railway workers have stopped all trains after the National Railway Workers' Union decided to support the strike movement, and postal workers also discussed responding to the strike on the 21st. Trolley workers in Toulon have also begun to become involved in the labor unrest, and even the port of Oran in French North Africa has begun to strike. Teachers in all schools in the Seine department have stopped teaching. The power of the nationwide miners' strike has reduced the country's coal reserves to a dangerous level, which has greatly alarmed the reactionary authorities. President Auriol has demanded that the workers "be quiet" and has called up those due for military service in 1947 in an attempt to strengthen the bloody suppression.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: Paris dispatch: Under the impact of the increasingly large wave of strikes by French workers, the Ramadier government, "shocked by the development of the situation, is trying to organize a new cabinet to deal with it, but he and his possible successor, former Prime Minister Reynaud, have not achieved rapid success" (Associated Press report on the 19th), and has announced its collapse. An AFP dispatch stated: Ramadier submitted his resignation to President Auriol on the evening of the 19th. On the same day, the Secretary-General of the French Socialist Party, Mollet, announced that Blum, notorious for his "anti-Soviet and anti-communist" stance, had accepted the organization of a new cabinet and would take "strict and perhaps unconventional" measures to counter the demands of the French working class. Mollet also stated: "People must remember that a civil war—this is undoubtedly a real and existing threat—may have international repercussions like Spain." This announcement by the Socialist Party leader, as well as the measure taken by Socialist Party Interior Minister Depreux on the 18th to request the parliament to revoke the qualifications of two Communist Party members of parliament (because they supported the workers' strikes), clearly indicates that the French Socialist Party has decided to further submit to the demands of the American authorities and De Gaulle to suppress the French working class. But this attempt will surely arouse the French workers to a more resolute struggle to defend democracy.

　　法共领导劳工大众团结行动
  　七十五万人大罢工
    拉马第被工潮冲击下台
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】据法新社等巴黎讯：法共于廿日晚发表告“男女同胞书”，内称：明日的政府准备打击的对象，就是工人与全国人民。这种政府，假如适合美帝国主义的希望的话，就将不符合于法国的意愿与需要。法国需要一个民主的政府，在这个政府里，共产党至少要起领导作用。宣言号召：“劳工大众团结和行动起来。”并敦促在各地组织保卫共和国，保卫工农业和国家独立的各种委员会。
    【综合新华社十九日至二十三日电】各方讯：法国工人继续英勇奋斗对抗社会党当局进攻工人阶级的反动措施，争取有保障的生活条件。十二日从马赛开始的大罢工日益扩大。到二十一日止，工潮已卷动全国，罢工人数已达七十五万。马赛工人的义举，不仅得到尼斯、土伦和北部加莱区工人阶级的同情罢工支援，而且受到甫抵港口之美国商船亨利·考斯丁号美国水手的支持。据合众社十八日电，该船美籍水手罢工后对法国工人的声明称：我们决定支持法国的罢工者，因为美国工人象法国人民一样，正在进行斗争，反对如塔虎脱——哈特莱法案之类的反劳工法，反对生活费高涨及住宅恶劣。声明更称：我们也支持你们反对马歇尔帝国主义计划的英勇斗争。马赛戴高乐派当局，受拉马第政府之命，大批逮捕工人，及以法国军队及摩洛哥部队，守卫政府建筑并运卸因罢工而停泊港口的货船上货物，企图以此破坏罢工。工人对此种反动措施不仅提出抗议，并向拉马第发出警告，将以全法海员之总罢工来对付社会党政府的破坏。又：戴高乐派市长前派赴赛得洛因区镇压罢工的两队治安防卫队，因其同情罢工而遭解散，此事亦引起马赛总工会的抗议。
    巴黎区将近三十万金属工人的罢工，已使汽车及航空工业陷于停顿。北部诺尔与加莱两省共十一万四千煤矿工人亦几乎全部罢工，使该地矿场关闭。马赛区的罢工者，已猛增至十万人，在马赛码头工人号召下，法国地中海一切港口均成死港。大西洋岸的波尔多港码头工人亦应马赛卸货工人之电请，拒绝装卸货物。同时北部恩省的建筑工人亦举行罢工。巴黎面粉工人的罢工已波及北部里尔与南部马赛及其他小城镇，因此各该地的面包店只好关门大吉。尼斯城电影院及自来水工厂职工与土伦兵工厂的八千职工，亦于十八日罢工。据法新社十九日电，总工会已命令各工会要求在每月最低薪水中增加三千八百法郎（约合三十一美元以上），并且在谈判未决定前增加薪水百分之二十五。
    工人不顾反动政府的武力镇压，纷纷占领工厂，并于各地组织罢工委员会。至二十一日，除巴黎、波尔多等已罢工的地方，运动正在持续深入外，赫劳和罗尼省矿工以及南部煤田的矿工，都已奋起参加诺尔和加莱省的罢工。马赛铁路工人在全国铁路工会决定支持罢工运动后，已使一切火车停开，邮局职工亦于二十一日商讨响应罢工行动。土伦的电车工人也开始卷入工潮，甚至法属北非的奥兰港亦已开始罢工。赛纳省一切学校的教员停止授课。扩及全国之矿工罢工的威力，已使全国存煤减至危险程度，这使反动当局大为震恐，总统阿里奥尔要求工人们“安静”，并召征一九四七年度应服军役的人，企图加强血腥的镇压。
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】巴黎讯：在法国劳工日益扩大的罢工浪头冲击下，拉马第政府“为形势发展所震惊，竭力想组织一新阁以资应付，但他和他的可能继承人前总理雷诺，都没有获得迅速的成就”（美联社十九日电），而宣告崩溃。法新社电称：拉马第十九日晚向总统阿里奥尔提出辞职。同日，法社会党总书记摩勒宣布，以“反苏反共”而臭名昭著的勃鲁姆已接受组织新阁，并将以“严厉而且或者是不合流俗的”措施，以对抗法国工人阶级的要求。摩勒并称：“人们必须记住，一次内战——这无疑地是一个现实的并存在着的威胁——或将如西班牙一样具有国际的反应”。众信社会党头脑之此项宣告，以及十八日社会党内政部长戴普里要求议会撤消两名共产党议员（因其赞助工人罢工）资格的措施，显然表示法国社会党已决心更进一步顺从美国当局与戴高乐的要求，镇压法国工人阶级。但此项企图，必将激起法国劳工为保卫民主的更坚决的斗争。
