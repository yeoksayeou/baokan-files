Xinhua News Agency, Yu-Shaan Front, 18th: Our army in the Eastern Front recaptured Linru County town on the morning of the 14th, and the defending enemy fled.

Xinhua News Agency, Yu-Shaan Front, 18th: The Front Headquarters of the Yu-Shaan People's Liberation Army has issued Communiqué No. 14, announcing the course and results of the first stage of the battle in the eastern foothills of Funiu Mountain: (1) Course of the battle: On the 1st of this month, our army on the Eastern Front launched an offensive on the 300-li front between Nanzhao and Dengfeng, and by the 6th, it had successively captured the cities of Linru, Lushan, Baofeng, Dengfeng, Jiaxian, Nanzhao, Yexian, and Fangcheng. This campaign had three significant characteristics: First, the battle was swift and the offensive was the fiercest. The battle in Nanzhao city was resolved in five minutes, and all the defending enemies were annihilated. Second, except for a part of the enemies in Lushan and Fangcheng who escaped, the rest of the enemies in each city were wiped out completely. Third, in the Longhai Campaign, the enemy-to-our casualty ratio was ten to one. This time, in Nanzhao, 350 enemies were captured, and we only suffered seven minor injuries; in Linru, 700 enemies were annihilated, and we suffered 54 injuries; in Lushan, over 30 enemies were captured, and we only suffered one minor injury. All these prove that our army's combat power has been unprecedentedly enhanced. After we launched the offensive, Li Tiejun immediately led the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's 5th Corps with seven brigades to aid, and from the 2nd, successively invaded and occupied the empty cities of Linru, Dengfeng, Jiaxian, Baofeng, Lushan, Yexian, and Fangcheng. We then maneuvered to strike the enemy. One part recaptured Linru Town west of Linru on the 8th, and another part recaptured Fangcheng on the 11th. The enemy's advance has been contained on the Lushan-Baofeng line. Li Tiejun was once again mobilized by us, and although he was exhausted, he gained nothing. (2) Results: Eight county towns were liberated, and the 15th Division direct unit, the special service battalion, and its newly replenished 190th and 191st Regiments, one battalion of the 125th Brigade of the 47th Division, and all the security regiments of Jiaxian, Linru, Xuchang, Dengfeng, Nanzhao, and Yexian, and the Baofeng Self-Defense Corps were annihilated. More than 590 enemies were killed or wounded, and 5,112 enemies, including the 15th Division Commander Wu Tinglin, Deputy Division Commanders Yao Beichen and Yang Tianming, were captured alive, totaling 5,702 annihilated. Nineteen artillery pieces of various types, 168 light and heavy machine guns, 2,911 rifles and carbines, more than 200,000 rounds of ammunition, eight radio stations, 46 telephones, six binoculars, nine cars, and more than 1.1 million catties of grain were seized.

Xinhua News Agency, Yu-Shaan Front, 18th: Farmers of Ligang, Fangcheng, unarmed, rose up and fought desperately with the stubborn county head. When we re-liberated Fangcheng on the 11th, the Chiang bandit county head Wang Jingxuan and the security regiment commander Ma Mingwu led more than a thousand local stubborn elements and fled east to the Gang and Xugang areas southeast of the city. A part of them looted wildly in Ligang and distributed food to the farmers, and anyone who was slightly negligent was brutally beaten. The masses could no longer tolerate it, and hundreds of men, women, and children in the whole village took wooden sticks and stones and fought desperately with the stubborn county head at dusk. The Chiang bandits immediately opened fire on the unarmed masses, and many people were injured and fell to the ground, and several people were arrested. Later, because someone shouted "The Liberation Army is here," the bandits began to flee southeast in a panic.

  　伏牛山东麓战役显示  我军战斗力空前提高
    【新华社豫陕前线十八日电】东线我军一部，十四日晨再克临汝县城，守敌逃窜。
    【新华社豫陕前线十八日电】豫陕解放军前线司令部顷发表第十四号公报，公布伏牛东麓战役第一阶段战斗经过及战果称：（一）战斗经过：本月一日，东线我军在南召，登封间三百里战线上发动攻势，至六日止，连克临汝、鲁山、宝丰、登封、郏县、南召、叶县、方城等城。此役显著特点有三：第一、战斗神速，攻势最猛，南召城五分钟即解决战斗，守敌悉数被歼。第二、各城守敌除鲁山、方城一部逃窜外，余皆一网打尽，彻底歼灭。第三、陇海战役，敌我伤亡比例为十比一，这次南召俘敌三百五十名，我仅轻伤七名；临汝歼敌七百名，我伤五十四名；鲁山俘敌三十余名，我仅轻伤一名。此皆证明我军战斗力空前提高。在我发动攻势后，李铁军即率领蒋匪第五兵团七个旅驰援，二日起相继侵陷临汝、登封、郏县、宝丰、鲁山、叶县、方城几座空城，我则机动击敌，一部于八日再克临汝西之临汝镇，一部于十一日再克方城，敌之进犯已被阻遏于鲁山、宝丰一线。李铁军再一次被我调动，虽疲于奔命，而一无所获。（二）战果：解放县城八座，歼灭敌第十五师师直、特务营及其所属刚补充起之一九○团、一九一团，四十七师一二五旅一个营，郏县、临汝、许昌、登封、南召、叶县保安团，宝丰自卫总队全部。毙伤敌五百九十余名，生俘十五师师长武庭麟、副师长姚北辰、杨天明以下五千一百一十二名，合计歼灭五千七百零二名。缴获各种炮十九门，轻重机枪一百六十八挺，长短枪二千九百一十一支，子弹二十余万发，电台八部，电话机四十六部，望远镜六付，汽车九辆，粮食一百一十余万斤。
    【新华社豫陕前线十八日电】方城李岗农民赤手空拳，奋起和顽县长拼命。十一日我再度解放方城时，蒋匪县长王敬轩与保安团长马鸣武，率土顽千余东逃至该城东南岗、徐岗地区，一部在李岗大肆抢劫，并向农家派饭，稍有怠慢，即遭毒打。群众忍无可忍，全村数百男女老幼于黄昏时，齐拿木棍石头和顽县长拼命。蒋匪即向手无寸铁的群众开枪，多人受伤倒地，并捕去数人。后因有人呼喊“解放军来了”，匪众始如惊弓之鸟，狼狈续向东南窜逃。
