Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, November 11th: Pingdu city in Jiaodong was recovered by our forces on the 8th. The defending enemy, Chiang Kai-shek's 54th Division, 198th Brigade, abandoned the city and fled. The city was occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits on September 8th.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, November 9th: The Lu Zhong Third Military Sub-district's main force once entered Yidu city, in the central section of the Jiaoji Railway, on the 30th of last month, killing or wounding over 50 Chiang Kai-shek's security regiment soldiers, capturing over 70, and seizing a portion of their weapons.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, November 10th: Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, trapped near Mianhua Mountain, about six miles northeast of Weihaiwei city, have no supplies and rely entirely on looting to survive. In the past ten days, they have ventured out four times to rob grain and fish, but were driven back by our Weihai garrison each time, with over 40 enemies killed or wounded.

Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, November 9th: The People's Liberation Army, in coordination with local armed forces, has continued to expand its offensive west of the Huaiyin-Shuyang highway and south of the Liutang River, wiping out the remaining Chiang Kai-shek bandits. They have successively captured Chiang Kai-shek's strongholds such as Tangji and Baji. Since the 25th of last month, 981 enemies have been annihilated, and the four districts in the northwest of Huaiyin, which had been occupied for thirteen months, have now been completely recovered. The people who have regained their freedom are now widely engaged in the struggle against traitors and local bullies.
