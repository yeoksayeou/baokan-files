　　【Our Newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 23rd dispatch】Under the slogan "Go to Nanjing, capture Chiang Kai-shek alive, and liberate all the people of the country!", Neihuang, Nanle, and Puyang have launched an upsurge in joining the army. On the 3rd of this month, Neihuang held a county-wide meeting of activists from counties, districts, and villages, making it clear that the task of enlisting should be entrusted to the masses. The discussion focused on ideological enlightenment, recognizing that if the mass line is not followed and the consciousness of the masses is not raised, not only will the task not be completed, but it will also have a great impact on future work. Therefore, the current counter-offensive situation was first discussed, followed by an analysis of the demands of the masses (i.e., the favorable conditions for joining the army), and the proposal of solutions to the difficulties in joining the army. Each district then consciously proposed enlistment tasks. After the meeting, each district held a district-wide cadre meeting to convey the current situation and tasks, and the enlistment movement was consciously launched from the bottom up. The Second District concluded its cadre meeting on the 8th, and held a village cadre model meeting on the 9th. After this meeting, it is also planned to hold a meeting of party members and middle and poor peasants to break through the situation in key villages and form a movement. When cadres studied the enlistment situation, they clarified the favorable conditions. The area had more than a year of mass mobilization work, and political awareness has been greatly improved. Especially after the invasion and ravages of Chiang bandits last year, the masses demanded to join the army to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek. As for the mobilization of women is not sufficient, and the distribution of fruits in individual villages is unreasonable, these difficulties can be overcome and resolved in the movement. Cadres, party members, and activists will inevitably take the lead consciously in the movement. At the village cadre hero meeting, the emotions were even more high-spirited. When discussing the current situation as "Go to Nanjing, capture Chiang Kai-shek alive," village cadre models consciously proposed the slogan: "To defeat old Chiang, people must join the army." The broad masses of liberated people, cadres and party members in Nanle have also begun to launch an enlistment movement. At the mass meeting in Liutun Village, Fourth District, 18 young adults immediately signed up. At the mass meeting of more than 2,000 people in the South Sub-district of the urban area, the registration for enlistment was even more eager. Li Kai of Caizhuang, Fifth District, was afraid of being said to be old, so he shaved his beard to sign up. Other examples of fathers sending sons and wives persuading husbands are emerging everywhere. In the Sixth District of Puyang, cadres, teachers, and students are competing to sign up. For example, Chang Guoyuan, the leader of the poor peasant group in Zhangyi Village, said: "I must take the lead in joining the army." Li Zhanghan, the leader of the poor peasant group, said: "I am old, I will send my son." Now each district and village is challenging each other.

  　认清反攻形势
  　青壮争先报名
    【本报冀鲁豫二十三日电】在“打到南京去，活捉蒋介石，全国人民大翻身！”的口号下，内黄、南乐、濮阳掀起了参军热潮。本月三日，内黄召开全县县区村活动分子大会，明确参军的任务应放手交给群众。讨论着重思想启发，认清如果不走群众路线，群众思想不提高，不但不能完成任务，对今后工作也有很大影响。于是首先讨论目前反攻形势，依次分析群众要求（即参军的有利条件），并提出解决参军中的困难问题，各区便自觉提出参军任务。会后，各区分别召开全区干部会，传达目前形势与任务，均由下而上自觉的展开参军运动。二区八日结束了干部会，九日召开村干英模大会，这个会开过后，还准备开党员与中贫农大会，以重点村突破局面，形成运动。在干部研究参军情况时，就都明确了有利条件，全区有一年多的发动群众工作，政治觉悟大大提高，尤其去年蒋匪的进攻蹂躏，群众有参军打倒蒋介石的要求；至于妇女发动的还不充分，个别村庄分配果实不合理等困难，在运动中是可以克服解决的。干部、党员、积极分子也必然在运动中，自觉的起带头作用。村干英雄大会上情绪更形高涨，当讨论到目前形势是“打到南京去，活捉蒋介石”时，村干模范自觉提出：“打老蒋，必须要人参军”的口号。南乐广大翻身群众及干部党员，亦开始掀起参军运动。四区六屯村群众大会上，当场即有十八名青壮年报名，城区南小区两千余人的群众大会上，报名参军的更是争先恐后。五区蔡庄李凯怕说自己老，剃了胡子去报名。其他父送子、妻劝郎的例子，更是到处涌现。濮阳六区干部、教员、学生争相报名，如张仪村贫农组长常锅元说：“我一定带头参军。”贫农组长李章韩说：“我年纪老了，我送我儿去。”现各区村正在互相挑战中。
