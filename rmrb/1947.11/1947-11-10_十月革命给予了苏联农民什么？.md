    What the October Revolution Gave to Soviet Peasants?

          —Editor

    More than forty years ago, a rural doctor named Shengyaliaofu—who was one of the leaders of the bourgeois "Constitutional Democratic Party" at the time—investigated two Russian villages. These were the villages of Novofushijinuoye and Mohewadeka, located in the center of the European part of Russia, not far from Voronezh. These were the most common villages in Russia before the revolution. Most of the land—10,000 Russian acres—belonged to a wealthy man named Wieniewiejinuofu, while 170 peasant households had only nearly 400 acres of cultivated land. The land owned by most peasants was so small that, as Shengyaliaofu pointed out, "there was simply no place to let the chickens out of the house."

    Naturally, the peasants could not support themselves on such a small plot of land, so they had to rent land from the landlords to cultivate. Rent was paid in cash and in kind, and the in-kind payments were divided into: working on the landlord's land and paying a portion of the harvest (no less than two-thirds of the total harvest). When working on the landlord's land, the working day often extended to, as Shengyaliaofu pointed out: "sixteen hours of work per day under conditions of extreme physical exertion." The best female farmhands earned fifteen to thirty kopecks a day, and male farmhands twenty to forty kopecks, and that was "food at their own expense."

    Those who worked "poorly" earned about ten to fifteen kopecks, which was not enough to buy even the coarsest food.

    The vast majority of farm households had no horses or farm tools, and the number of such households was increasing year by year.

    In 1901, in Novofushijinuoye village, households without horses accounted for 38 percent, and in 1917, 47 percent; in Mohewadeka village, in 1901, it was 9 percent, and in 1917, 34 percent. Almost more than one-fifth of the peasants had no livestock at all, not even a goat.

    As a result of Dr. Shengyaliaofu's careful study of peasant life, he found that in the entire year of 1901, the 520 peasants in Mohewadeka village consumed only 40 centimeters of sugar.

    He also wrote: "Many farm households are unable to buy cabbage, cucumbers, or meat, and many families have no milk all year round. Is this not a manifestation of chronic malnutrition and constant poverty?"

    As Shengyaliaofu wrote in his book "The Dying Village," the food of the poor peasants is difficult to understand. For example, they are satisfied with 13.5 centimeters of fat per day... Such food might be called "chronic hunger"!

    When the survey was conducted again in 1907, the situation appeared even worse. "The residents here are still on the final edge of near death." (Quoted from Suvaliaofu's "Old Village and New Village").

    At that time, Dr. Shengyaliaofu's book "The Dying Village" shocked the whole of Russia.

    Shengyaliaofu investigated the most typical villages in the central region of Russia. Tens of millions of peasants, not only poor peasants but also middle peasants, endured the oppression of landlords and the Tsarist regime, living a life of barely surviving.

    In Russia, the land owned by 30,000 landlords was almost the same as the land owned by 10 million farm households. In addition to the oppression of the Tsar and landlords, there was also the exploitation of rich peasants, usurers, merchants, and speculators. They tied down the hard-working peasants with small loans and debts, forcing them to spend years paying off their labor and property.

    Before the revolution, the extreme backwardness of the agricultural economy often caused poor harvests and famines. In years of poor harvests, peasants ate grass, bark, and acorns. Peasants chronically starved, and tens of thousands died from hunger and epidemics during famines. Their living standards were like beggars: living in small houses with livestock, wearing coarse cloth clothes.

    Working peasants had no rights at that time. Sheriffs and patrolmen often arbitrarily bullied them, flogging them for not paying taxes. Most peasants were illiterate, completely suffocated by the darkness of ignorance.

    The toiling peasants, enslaved by landlords and rich peasants, lived very painfully.

    The great October Revolution rescued the Russian toiling peasant masses from a state of decline and death.

    With the victory of the socialist revolution, a new era of the Soviet state began. The Soviet regime handed over more than 150 million hectares of land to the peasants for use, land that was previously occupied by landlords, big capitalists, and the royal family.

    The land was declared the property of the state, the property of the whole people, so it could not be sold or mortgaged. It was given to the peasants for use, without any compensation. The peasants were freed from the burden of paying rent to the landlords. The rent previously paid to the landlords amounted to 500 million gold rubles per year. The Soviet regime relieved the peasants of all debts and unpaid taxes. This amounted to 1.3 billion gold rubles.

    The Soviet regime not only completely liquidated the land ownership of the landlords, but also suppressed the local tyrants and rich peasants. The 50 million hectares of land occupied by speculators were distributed to middle and poor peasants for use.

    The Soviet regime inherited a backward industry from Tsarist Russia, so it began to industrialize the country. It established huge tractor factories and agricultural machinery manufacturing plants in order to massively supply collective farmers with the tractors and other agricultural machinery they needed. The Soviet regime declared that poor and middle peasants who united in collective economies could use tractors and other agricultural machinery.

    The nationalization of land, the liquidation of landlord land ownership, the elimination and suppression of rural capitalists and exploiters, and the industrialization of the country—all of these were necessary conditions for the transition from individual peasants to a new road, the road of collective farms.

    This is why the Russian peasants supported the October Revolution. It was the revolution that helped them remove the landlords, capitalists, rich peasants, and speculators from their shoulders, and began the struggle for a new life.

    As individual farming using old-fashioned farm tools and backward technology transitioned to collective farming applying mechanical technology, the lives of the peasants also fundamentally changed.

    Based on years of farming experience, the peasants were convinced that using old-fashioned tools to farm alone on a small plot of land could not improve their lives or increase their happiness. Moreover, individual farming could not completely free them from the enslavement of rich peasants. In order to improve their material and cultural standards year by year, they had to choose a new path—the path of collectivization.

    The Soviet state welcomed and helped the peasants to unite and collectivize in various ways. It supplied the peasants with hundreds of thousands of tractors and other agricultural machinery, which could not be used on individually operated small farms. It established cultivation machine stations to help the collective farms cultivate the land. It lent the collective farms hundreds of millions of rubles. It guaranteed that hundreds of millions of hectares of land would be supplied to the collective farms permanently and without cost for use. It was responsible for educating tens of millions of peasants, and training tractor drivers, combine operators, mechanics, livestock experts, and other skilled workers among the rural youth. It helped the collective farmers obtain superior breeds of livestock, pure seeds, building materials, and so on.

    Due to the shift to collective farming, agricultural productivity increased by leaps and bounds in a very short period of time. Soviet agriculture has been transformed into highly mechanized agriculture. Correct cyclical sowing methods and progressive agricultural technologies have a profound foundation, and the scientific achievements in agronomy and animal husbandry have also been widely adopted. If the annual grain harvest was 70 to 80 million tons before the organization of collective farms, then before the Second World War it reached 120 million tons. The harvest of industrial plants, cotton, hemp, and feed, etc., increased more than twofold. The total agricultural harvest increased more than twofold. The quantity of agricultural products increased even more. The Soviet Union became the most developed agricultural country in the world.

    The collectivization of agriculture completely changed the lives of the peasants. They began to live a prosperous and cultured life. In the collective farms, the total grain harvest of each farm household was two and a half times more than the income of poor and middle peasants in the Tsarist era. In 1932, when the organization of collective farms began, each collective farmer could obtain 1-2 kilograms of grain for each labor day, but in 1939, they received 5-12 kilograms, and sometimes even 20 kilograms.

    During the period of the Second Five-Year Plan (1932 to 1938), the demand for meat by collective farmers increased 2.3 times; the demand for oils and fats increased 2.8 times, and sugar—8.8 times.

    A true cultural revolution took place in the countryside. This revolution was the result of the October Revolution.

    The new Soviet peasant, this is no longer the peasant described by Shengyaliaofu who was often beaten. This is also no longer the backward "farmer" described by great Russian writers such as Tolstoy, Nekrasov, Uspensky in entire volumes. The new peasant—this is a collective farmer who possesses machines, advanced agricultural technology and scientific knowledge, and he is managing agriculture in a scientific manner. He is an organizer of large-scale social production. Millions of peasants are being trained to operate machines and advanced agricultural technology. Many specialized schools are opened for peasants throughout the country. Peasants' children can receive various educations, including higher education. A quarter of the representatives in the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union are peasants. Among them are famous combine operators, tractor drivers, collective farm chairmen and directors, and farm shock troops and leaders.

    Now let us go back to the villages of Mohewadeka and Novofushijinuoye in the former Voronezh province. In 1936 and 1937, a group of Soviet scientists investigated these two villages. The results of the investigation were also compared with Shengyaliaofu's data. Look! What a difference!

    Poverty and the poor, begging and beggars have disappeared. The peasants have established two large collective farms. These two farms are equipped with machine cultivation stations. The farmland now used by the peasants is several times larger than before the revolution. The land of 200 farm households was divided into 10,000 ridges in the past, but now they are merged into two large blocks. The harvest has greatly increased, about more than twofold. Productivity has increased fivefold. The peasants have begun to live a prosperous life. It is worth pointing out that the demand for fat, sugar, and other precious foods has increased many times. For example, the demand for sugar has increased from 40 centimeters to 5,580 centimeters. The peasants no longer wear straw sandals and homespun jackets, they wear leather boots, leather shoes, and clothes worn by city dwellers. They have books, bicycles, exquisite utensils, and other cultural and daily necessities. Dozens of farm children in Novofushijinuoye village and Hvadka village have received higher or secondary education in the era of the Soviet regime, and have become members of the Soviet intelligentsia.

    The Soviet peasants, together with the entire Soviet people, endured the suffering of the patriotic war against the German aggressors.

    The collective farmers faithfully fulfilled their responsibilities to the country. Under the difficult conditions of wartime, they guaranteed the food and industrial raw materials for the Soviet army and city residents, although the collective farms in the combat areas suffered serious damage.

    At that time, the collective farm women were very hardworking, because they had to work non-stop with their hands in order to complete their own and the men's double work. However, the Soviet peasants finally passed the great test, and they helped defend the freedom and independence of the motherland just as they did during the civil war. Millions of Soviet peasants are now working tirelessly to restore farms and raise postwar standards. Although there are many difficulties caused by the results of war damage on their road, the Soviet collective peasants are not afraid of these difficulties, and they will overcome these difficulties with tireless labor with the constant and huge assistance of the country.

    十月革命给予了苏联农民什么？
    勃拉金斯基作

    这篇文章原载上海出版的时代杂志。在解放区进行土地改革运动的时候，我们将它在这里发表，以纪念今年的十月革命节。
          ——编者
    四十余年前，有一个叫申加廖夫的乡村医师——他是当时资产阶级的“民主立宪党”的领袖之一，——曾经调查过两个俄国的农村。这是坐落在俄国欧洲部分的中心，离伏洛聂士城不远的诺伏士伏金诺耶村和莫赫瓦德卡村。这两个都是俄国革命之前最普通的农村。大部分土地——一万俄亩——属于一个叫维聂维金诺夫的富豪地在，而一百七十家农户却只有近四百俄亩的耕地。大多数农民的土地是少到这样程度，正象申加廖夫所指出的那样，“简直没有地方可以把鸡从家里放出去”。
    自然，农民们靠着一小块地是养不活自己的，于是就只得向地主租地耕种，地租分现金和实物两种，而实物又分为：在地主的田地上耕作和缴纳一部分收获物（不会少于总收获量的三分之二）。在地主的土地上工作时，工作日常常延长到象申加廖夫所指出的：“农民在极度紧张的体力劳动条件下每日做十六小时的工作。”工作最优秀的农妇每日得工资是十五个到三十个戈比，农夫二十个到四十个戈比，而且是“膳食自理”。
    工作得“蹩脚的”差不多只有十个到十五个戈比，这些钱就是买最粗劣的饭食也不够。
    极大部分的农户都没有马匹，没有农具，而且这种农户的数量是一年一年地增加着。
    一九○一年在诺伏士伏金诺耶村里，没有马匹的农户占百分之三十八，而在一九一七年占百分之四十七；在莫赫瓦德卡村，一九○一年占百分之九，一九一七年是百分之三十四。差不多有五分之一以上的农民完全没有牲畜，甚至连山羊也没有一头。
    申加廖夫医师精密地研究农民生活的结果，发现在一九○一年的整整一年中，莫赫瓦德卡村的五百二十个农民只消耗了四十公分的糖。
    他还这样写过：“有许多农户无力购买卷心菜，黄瓜，肉类，有许多家庭终年没有牛奶。难道这不是慢性的营养不足和经常的赤贫的表现吗？”
    正象申加廖夫在“垂死的乡村”一书里所写的，贫农的食物是难以了解的，举个例子说：每天有十三公分半的脂肪就很满足了……这样的食物也许可以称为“慢性的饥饿”吧！
    当一九○七年作再度调查的时候，情况就显得更坏了。“这里的居民依旧处在濒临死境的最后边缘上。”（引自苏伐也夫的“旧农村和新农村”）。
    当时申加廖夫医生的那本“垂死的乡村”，曾震动了整个俄罗斯。
    申加廖夫所调查的是俄国中部地区最典型的乡村。成千万的农民，不仅是贫农，而且还有中农忍受着地主和沙皇政权的压榨，他们度着苟延残喘的生活。
    在俄罗斯，三万个地主所有的土地差不多就和一千万家农户所有的土地一样。除了沙皇和地主的压迫之外，还有富农，高利贷者，商人和投机家的榨取。他们以小额的放款和债务束缚住辛劳的农民，使他们不得不成年累月地拿自己的劳动与财产来偿付。
    革命前，农业经济极度落后性，常常引起歉收与饥馑。在歉收的年头，农民们就吃青草，树皮和橡实。农民们慢性地挨着饿，成千成万地由于饥饿和歉收时的疫病而死去。他们的生活水准和乞丐一样：跟牲畜一起居住在小房子里，穿着粗布的衣服。
    劳动农民在当时是没有权利的。警长和巡官常常任意地欺侮他们，为了不付捐税就笞挞他们。大多数农民都不识字，他们是完全被无知的黑暗所窒息了。
    处于地主和富农的奴役下的劳苦农民们，生活非常痛苦。
    伟大的十月革命把俄国的劳动农民大众从垂微和垂死的境况中拯救出来了。
    随着社会主义革命的胜利，开始了苏维埃国家的新时代，苏维埃政权把一万五千万公顷以上的土地交给农民们使用，这些土地以前是地主，大资本家和皇室所占有的。
    土地被宣布为国家的财产，全民的财产，因此它不可能被出售或抵押。它交给农民们使用，不需任何报偿。农民解脱了向地主付租的重担。而以前每年缴纳给地主的租金达五万万金卢布之多。苏维埃政权解除了农民的所有的债务和未缴纳的欠税。这笔总数是十三万万金卢布。
    苏维埃政权不仅彻底清算了地主们的土地所有权，而且还抑制了土豪和富农。投机家所占有的广达五千万公顷的土地都分配给中农和贫农们使用。
    苏维埃政权从帝俄手里领到的遗产是一份落后的工业，因此它开始把国家工业化。它建立了庞大的曳引机工厂，农业机器制造厂，以便大量供给集体农民所需的曳引机和其他农业机械。苏维埃政权宣布，凡是在集体经济中联合起来的贫农和中农，都可以使用曳引机和其他农业机械。
    土地的国有，地主土地占有权的清算，乡村资本家和剥削者的消灭和压制，国家的工业化——这一切都是从个别的农民转变到新的道路，集体农场的道路所必须具备的条件。
    这就是为什么俄国的农民们支持了十月革命。正是革命帮助他们把跨在他们肩上的地主，资本家，富农和投机分子卸下来，并且开始了新生活的斗争。
    随着使用旧式农具和落后技术的个别耕种转为应用机械技术的集体耕种，农民的生活也根本改变了。
    根据多年来耕种的经验，农民们确信如果使用旧式工具，单独在一小方田地上耕种，这是不能改善他们的生活和增加他们的幸福的。而且，个别的耕种是不能彻底使他们免除富农的奴役的。为了一年年地提高自己物质和文化的水准起见，必须选择一条新的道路——集体化的道路。
    苏维埃国家欢迎并且用各种方式帮助农民们团结和集体化。它以几十万架曳引机及其他农业机械供给农民们，这种机械在个别经营的小农土地上是不可能应用的。它建立耕种机站以帮助各集体农场耕种田地。它以几十万万的卢布贷予各集体农场。它保证把几万万公顷的土地永远地，并且无代价地供给各集体农场使用。它负责教育千万的农民，并且在农村青年中训练曳引机手，联合机手，机匠，牲畜专家以及别的熟练的工作人员。它帮助集体农民们获得优种的牲畜，纯净的种子，建筑材料等等。
    由于转向集体耕种的缘故，农业生产力在极短时期内，就突飞猛进地增长起来。苏联的农业已经转变为高度机械化的农业了。正确的循环播种法和进步的农业技术已有了深远的基础，农艺和畜牲方面的科学成就，也都被广泛地采用了。如果在未组织集体农场以前每年谷类收获量是七千到八千万吨，那么在第二次大战之前就达一万二千万吨了。工业用植物，棉，麻以及饲料等的收获量增加了二倍以上。农业的总收获量增加了一倍以上。农产品的数量增加得更多。苏联成了世界上农业最发达的国家。
    农业的集体化彻底改变了农民们的生活。他们开始过着富裕的和文化的生活。在集体农场里，每一家农户的谷类总收获量较帝俄时代的贫农和中农，收入要多二倍半。在一九三二年，在开始组织集体农场的时候，每个集体农民可以用，个劳动日获得１—２公斤的谷类，然而在一九三九年，他们就得到５—１２公斤，甚至有时有２０公斤。
    在推行第二次五年计划的期间（一九三二年到一九三八年）集体农民对于肉类的需求增加了二．三倍；油脂的需求增加二．八倍，糖——八．八倍。
    乡村里进行了一次真正的文化革命。这个革命是十月革命的结果。
    新的苏联农民，这已经不是申加廖夫所描写的那种挨打的农民。这也已经不是象托尔斯泰，聂克拉索夫，乌斯宾斯基等伟大的俄国作家以整卷的篇幅来描写的那些落后的“农夫”了。新的农民——这是拥有机器，进步的农业技术和科学知识的集体农民，他是依照科学方式经营农业的。他是一个大规模社会生产的组织者。千百万农民都受着驾御机器和进步的农艺技术的训练。全国各地都为农民开设许多专门学校。农民的孩子可以受到各种教育，包括高等教育。在苏联最高苏维埃的代表中有四分之一是农民。其中有著名的联合机手，曳引机手，集体农场主席与理事，农场的突击队员与负责人等。
    现在让我们回过来谈谈前伏龙聂十州的莫赫瓦德卡村和诺伏士伏金诺耶村吧。在一九三六年至一九三七年有一个苏联科学家团体曾调查过这两个乡村。调查的结果还跟申加廖夫的资料作过比较。瞧！分别是多么大啊！
    贫困和贫民，乞食和乞丐都消失了。农民们建立了两个庞大的集体农场。这两个农场都设有机器耕种机站。农民们现在所使用的耕地要比革命以前大几倍。从前二百家农户的土地被划分成一万条畦，现在它们却合并为二大块。收获大大地增加，约多二倍以上。生产力增大了五倍。农民们开始过着富裕的生活。值得指出的是脂肪，糖，以及其他珍贵食物的需求量是上升了许多倍。譬如说糖的需求量就由四十公分上升到五千五百八十公分。农民们不再穿草鞋和家里自织的褂衣，他们穿皮靴，皮鞋和城里人穿的衣服。他们有书籍，脚踏车，精美的器皿以及其他文化和日常应用的东西。诺伏士伏金诺耶村和赫瓦德卡村有几十个农家孩子，在苏维埃政权时代受了高等或中等教育，并且挤身在苏维埃知识分子之列了。
    苏联农民跟全体苏联人民一同在反抗德国掠夺者的卫国战争中忍受了苦难的试炼。
    集体农民们忠实地执行了对国家的责任，在战时的艰苦条件下，他们保证了苏联军队和城市居民粮食及工业用的原料，虽然在作战的地区里集体农场遭受了重大的破坏。
    在那时集体农妇们是很辛苦的，因为她们必须要双手不停地工作，以便完成她们自己的和男人们的双份工作。然而苏联农民终于通过了伟大的试炼，他们也正象在内战时期那样，帮助守卫了祖国的自由和独立。千百万的苏联农民现在正不停地为复兴农场和提高战后水准而工作。虽则在他们的路上有着不少因战争破坏的结果而引起的困难，但苏联集体农民是不怕这些困难的，他们在国家的经常和巨大的援助下一定会以不倦的劳动来克服这些困难。
