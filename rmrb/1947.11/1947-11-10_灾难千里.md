(From the Yellow River Flood Area to Hubei, Henan, and Anhui)

I.

The Yellow River flood area, hundreds of miles wide, has seen its once-prosperous villages completely submerged in silt over ten feet deep. The sunny main roads of the past are nowhere to be found; only a few small trees faintly visible, sheltering three or five thatched huts. The people of the flood area are rebuilding their homes in the overgrown wilderness, where raccoon dogs and badgers thrive.

In the fading light of the setting sun, an old villager led us to Ding Village to spend the night. This village is a central market town between Taikang and Fugou, with over three hundred households. In the spring of 1938, the bandit Chiang Kai-shek breached the dyke and released the water, submerging everything. In 1941, when the Yellow River returned to its course, people had just returned to their homeland when they were hit by the four major disasters of flood, drought, locusts, and Tang (Tang Enbo). Those who fled early wandered, begging for food, selling their wives and children to barely survive. Those who fled late starved to death on the roadside, their corpses exposed in the wilderness. Villagers who mentioned the situation at that time would often cover their faces and weep. To this day, less than sixty households have returned to the village.

When the reporter talked to the villagers about the disaster, the village head, Tang Xinzhi, said with hatred: "Mentioning the Yellow River, our descendants will never forget Chiang Kai-shek. That year, when the old devils (Japanese invaders) occupied Xuzhou, the 'Central Army' fled west with all their might. The people were kept in the dark, and who knew he would breach the dyke to cover their retreat. After the 'Central Army' passed, the Yellow River came rushing in, like the sky had fallen. Adults cried, children screamed. At first, everyone built dams day and night, but later the Yellow River became more and more fierce, and the dams were breached. Everyone scrambled to escape. Those who escaped late were either washed away by the Yellow River or starved to death sitting down. Later, when the Yellow River flowed to the west, some returned home, but Chiang Kai-shek sent a guerrilla commander named Wang Jieye, who robbed the area seven times. In the winter, people couldn't even wear cotton-padded clothes. The people gave him the nickname 'Sweep All Away.' It wasn't until 1945, when the New Fourth Army drove away Wang Jieye, that we returned home for the second time, established organizations to stand up, and, with the support of the democratic government, opened up wasteland and built houses. This year, we have also been allocated land and can eat our fill and dress warmly, and now we are truly living like human beings." (Xu Tai)

II.

When the reporter arrived in Huangchuan and Shangcheng, the area had just been ravaged by Chiang's bandits from the 48th and 58th Divisions. In the dozens of villages the reporter passed through, not a single living cow, donkey, chicken, or duck could be seen. Every household's house and yard were filled with cow bones and chicken and duck feathers. The kitchen, main room, and even beside the beds were full of human excrement and horse manure. All the tables, chairs, and farm tools were burned. All the men who had not had time to escape were arrested, and more than 80% of the women were raped. In Shuangliu Village, fifty li southeast of Huangchuan, Xie Kuanxiang's wife, who was seven months pregnant, was not spared. After five animals from the 48th Division gang-raped her, they stomped on her abdomen with leather shoes studded with iron nails, killing her on the spot. When the reporter saw her body, her lower body was still bleeding. In the Shangshiqiao market town, thirty li north of Shangcheng, in the hour before Chiang's bandit's 58th Division suffered a devastating blow and collapsed completely, three animals raped a thirteen-year-old girl, Hong Nian, to death. (Ke Gang)

The reporter investigated the burden on the masses in the Shangcheng and Guangshan area under the rule of Chiang's bandits: The area is mostly mountainous, and the best paddy fields yield only two shi of rice per mu per year, with the average being one shi, two or three dou. However, the official burden imposed on the masses by Chiang's bandits includes the following: (1) Grain tax: Each mu of land pays one silver dollar per year. According to the current market price, one silver dollar can be exchanged for 22,000 yuan in Chiang's currency, but Chiang's tax authorities stipulate that 70,000 yuan in Chiang's currency must be paid, and they only accept Chiang's currency, not silver dollars. The people have to sell their rice at low prices, selling each dou for only 14,000 yuan in Chiang's currency, and it takes more than five dou of grain to pay the tax for one mu of land; (2) Rice tax: Each mu of land pays four dou of grain, to be paid in full after the rice harvest; (3) Wheat tax: Each mu of land pays two dou of wheat, to be paid in full after the wheat harvest. The burden of these three items alone is one shi and one dou and six sheng per mu, which accounts for 90% of the average harvest of ordinary fields. In addition, there are Baojia fees: paid in kind per household. An average middle-class household needs to pay the Bao head one and a half dou of rice and 20 jin of firewood per month; Draftee fees: depending on the number of draftees conscripted. Recently, each Bao has drafted five draftees. Hiring a substitute draftee costs 200 to 300 silver dollars, which is equivalent to more than 5 million yuan in legal tender. In this way, the entire Bao needs to pay as much as 25 million yuan in Chiang's currency. Because the burden is so heavy, many farmers cannot pay off the burden even if they hand over all the harvest from the fields. But what the masses hate most is that when Chiang's bandit army invaded the Central Plains Liberated Area at the end of June last year, the traitors, local tyrants, and evil gentry who had fled to avoid punishment all ran back and became the district, township, and Bao heads of Chiang's bandit regime. They forced the people to pay the Baojia fees and grain and firewood for the past ten months and demanded immediate payment. The township and Bao heads in the Yujiaji area of Shangcheng even doubled the collection of Baojia fees for ten months on the pretext of rising prices and the fall of Chiang's currency. If the people could not pay, they were immediately arrested and detained, and severely tortured until the people sold their houses and land to pay the money before they could be released. Many people were ruined as a result. A folk song was widely circulated in the area: "Give birth to children for Chiang Kai-shek, harvest grain for the Bao head, the common people starve." (Tang Ximin)

III.

The reporter passed through hundreds of li on the border between Henan and Anhui, and the most common sight in every village was the conscription slogans all over the walls: "Guarantee general mobilization, even orphans must enlist," "Those who fabricate exemption from military service will be sentenced to more than three years in prison." Fifteen li east of Shenqiu, in a thatched house in Zhaolou Village, Zhao Yanlin's mother led her young daughter-in-law and grandson, who was less than one year old, and said to the reporter: "I only have one child. This spring, they were arrested and starved to death in the city, and the little food in the family was also robbed. I know the location of the joint defense warehouse, you quickly open it and return my food to me! Otherwise, we won't be able to survive this autumn!" In Tongzhuang, north of Xincai, with fifty households, the reporter stayed for three days and did not see a single adult man. All were old people and children. Tang Hanping, who was seventy years old, said to me: "More than seventy young people from this village have been arrested, but most of these people starved to death in the city before entering the troop. Since this spring, more than thirty young widows have been added to this village. They always cry from dusk till dawn on the first and fifteenth of every month, but what's the use of crying? If you had come earlier, it would have been better!"

When passing through Chuanliudian Village, the eighth Bao of the second district of Huangchuan, Kang Jinyun, who was suffering from kala-azar, led the reporter to visit Hu Pangzi and Wu Zhuanglin, who had cut off their right hands to avoid conscription, and Li Chenghai, who had blinded his eyes. Hu Pangzi's and Wu Zhuanglin's hands were cut off by their own mothers with kitchen knives amidst the loud cries of their families. Li Chenghai was a very handsome young man. When I asked about his eyes, he lowered his head and said nothing. His twenty-three-year-old wife, holding back her tears, said: "I pierced his eyeballs with needles! At that time, people surrounded the village to arrest people. What could I do?" Before she could finish her words, she turned around and went back to the house and burst into tears. (Ke Gang)

IV.

When the reporter arrived in the Huang'an and Macheng area, Chiang's bandits were forcibly buying up large quantities of wheat and cotton in Huang'an, Macheng, Huanggang, Huangpi, and other places. The prices of cotton and wheat have skyrocketed. A few months ago, one shi of wheat sold for 40,000 yuan in Chiang's currency. After the purchase, it suddenly rose to 160,000 yuan. Cotton rose from 80,000 yuan per shi last month to 210,000 yuan. Cotton and wheat are transported to Hankou in special trains. Purchasing offices are set up in various townships, or designated grain stores and cotton shops are authorized to search and purchase. According to merchants familiar with the inside story, Chiang's bandits plan to purchase 1,436,500 dan in Hubei. After this purchase, wheat has disappeared from the market, and cotton is also gradually running out. With winter approaching, the people will inevitably suffer from cold and hunger. Fortunately, the strength of the People's Liberation Army has been increasing day by day, and the area scraped by Chiang's bandits is getting smaller and smaller. In many places, wheat and cotton have begun to fall sharply. The net price of cotton has fallen from 210,000 to 140,000 and is expected to continue to fall. (Wang Kuang)

    灾难千里
    新华社记者集体报导
    （由黄泛区至鄂豫皖）
    一、
    宽达百余里的黄泛区，昔日繁荣的村镇，已完全陷入深达丈余的淤泥之中。当年阳关大道，今已无处寻觅，只见隐隐约约几株小树，掩映着三五茅棚。泛区人民正在乱草蓬生，貉獾如织的荒原，重建家业。
    夕阳残照中一位老乡引导我们到丁＠投宿，该村是太康、扶沟间的中心市镇，共有三百多户，民国二十七年春，蒋贼掘堤放水，全部如陷陆沈。民国三十年黄水归槽，人们刚返回故园，又连遭水、旱、蝗、汤（汤恩伯）四大灾害。早逃者辗转乞食，卖妻卖子，幸保残躯。晚逃者饿死道旁，暴尸荒野。居民提及当时情景，每每掩面而泣，直至今日，该村返家者，尚不足六十户。
    当记者与村民谈及被灾情形时，农会长唐新之愤恨的说：“提起黄水子子孙孙也忘不了蒋介石，那年老日（日寇）占了徐州，只见‘中央军’一股劲的往西逃命，老百姓坐在鼓里，谁知他掘堤掩护逃命，等‘中央军’过完了，黄水也冲来了，就象塌了天一样，大人哭，小孩叫，起初还家家天天打坝，后来黄水越来越凶，坝也冲断了，大家才争着向外逃，逃得晚的不是被黄水冲走，就是坐着饿死。后来，黄水滚到西边，有的回了家，不料蒋介石又派了一个游击司令叫王介业的，在这一带抢了七次，冬天连个棉袄也穿不上，老百姓送他一个外号叫‘一扫光’。直到民国三十四年，新四军赶走了王介业，俺们第二次回家，成立了翻身团体，在民主政府救济扶持下，开起了荒地，搭起房子，今年又分了土地，吃得饱穿得暖，这才真的过着人的日子。”（徐态）
    二、
    记者到达潢川商城时，该地正遭蒋匪四十八师与五十八师等部窜扰不久，记者所过数十村庄之内，看不见一只活着的牛驴和鸡鸭，家家户户的屋里和院里，都是牛骨头鸡鸭毛，厨房、堂屋、甚至床铺旁边都是人屎、马粪，桌椅农具悉被烧光，所有未及跑脱的男人，全被抓走，百分之八十以上的妇女遭到了奸污。在潢川东南五十里的双柳村，木匠谢宽祥的妻子怀孕七月，亦未幸免。四十八师五个畜牲将她轮奸之后，又用满钉铁钉的皮鞋，在她腹部猛踏几脚，当场绝气。记者看到她的尸体时，下部尚在流血。商城以北三十华里的上石桥集上，蒋匪五十八师在遭受歼灭性打击全线混乱的前一小时，三个畜牲把小贩子洪年十三岁的女孩活活奸死了。（柯岗）
    记者调查了一下商城、光山一带群众在蒋匪统治下的负担：当地多系山地，每亩顶好的水田全年仅收稻子两石，一般的平均在一石二、三斗，但群众对蒋匪的正式负担即有如下几种：（一）粮银：每亩地全年纳银洋一元，依目前市价，银洋一元换蒋币两万二千元，但蒋匪收税机关却规定必需交七万蒋钞，而且只收蒋钞，不要银元，老百姓只得低价来变卖稻子，每斗仅售蒋钞一万四千元，五斗多谷，才可以交足一亩地的银子；（二）稻捐：每亩地交谷四斗，于割稻后一次交完；（三）麦捐：每亩地麦子二斗，于收麦后一次交足。仅以上三项，每亩地的负担为一石一斗六升，已达一般田地平均收获数量的百分之九十。此外尚有保甲费：按户出实物，一般的中等户，每月均需向保长交纳大米一斗半，柴廿斤；壮丁费：视抽壮丁多寡而定，最近半年每保已抽壮丁五名，雇买一个壮丁，需银洋二百元到三百元，折合法币五百万元以上。这样全保即需出蒋币达二千五百万元之巨。由于负担如此苛重，许多农民即使将地里收获全部交纳，也无法把负担交清；但最使群众痛恨的，是去年六月底蒋匪军进犯中原解放区时，过去畏罪潜逃的汉奸恶霸土豪劣绅，又都一齐跑回来，当了蒋匪政权的区乡保长。他们强迫老百姓补交以往十个月的保甲费和粮柴，要立即交清；商城余家集一带的乡保长，更借口物价上涨，蒋钞跌落，将十个月的保甲费加倍征收，老百姓交纳不出，则立被拘捕扣押，严刑吊打，非至老百姓卖房卖地将款交足不能释放，不知多少老百姓因此而破家荡产，当地曾普遍流传着一首民谣：“生下孩子给老蒋，打下粮食给保长，黎民百姓饿肚肠。”（唐西民）
    三、
    记者经豫皖边境数百里，沿途每一个村庄最多见的是满墙壁的抓丁标语：“保证总动员，孤子要出征”，“捏造缓役者处三年以上徒刑”，在沈邱以东十五华里，赵楼村的一座茅房里，赵延林的母亲领着她的年轻儿媳和不满周岁的孙儿，向记者说：“俺只有一个孩子，今年春天叫他们给抓到城里饿死了，家里的一点粮食也被他们抢光了。联保处的仓库我知道，你们赶快打开它，把俺的粮食还给俺吧！要不，今秋就过不去呀！”在新蔡以北五十户的同庄，记者停留了三天之久，没有见到一个壮年人，所有的都是老人和孩子，七十岁的唐汉平对我说：“这村的青年人，已被抓走七十多个了，可是这些人，有一大半都没有进队部就饿死在城里了，今年春天到现在，光这村的青年寡妇就添了三十多，她们每逢初一十五，总是从黄昏哭到大天明，可是哭有啥用呢？要是你们早来不就好了么？”
    在潢川第二区第八保川流店村路过的时候，害着黑热病的康进云带着记者，访问了为免抓丁而砍断了右手的胡胖子、吴庄林和弄瞎了眼睛的李成海，胡胖子和吴庄林的手都是在一家大小号淘痛哭中，被亲生他们的母亲用切菜刀给砍掉的，李成海是个非常漂亮的小伙子，当我问到他的眼睛时，他低头不语，他的二十三岁的妻子，忍着眼泪说：“都是我用针把他的眼珠刺破的呀！当时人家把村子围起来要抓人， 有啥法呀！ ”他的话没有说完，就转身回到屋里放声哭起来了。
                  （柯岗）
    四、
    记者到达黄安、麻城一带时，蒋贼正在黄安、麻城、黄岗、黄陂等地，强迫大量收买小麦、棉花。花价麦价暴涨，数月前，小麦一石卖蒋币四万元，收买后骤涨至十六万元，棉花则由前月每石八万元，骤涨至二十一万元，棉、麦都用专车源源运往汉口，各乡镇分设征购处，或指定粮行花庄代为搜购。据熟悉内幕的商人谈，蒋贼计划在湖北搜购一百四十三万六千五百担，经此搜购后，市上麦已绝迹，棉花亦渐告罄，冬令在即，人民难免冻馁，幸人民解放军力量已日益扩大，蒋贼搜刮区域日小，许多地方麦棉已开始大跌，现净花已由二十一万，降至十四万，且势将继续下跌。（王匡）
