(Comprehensive Xinhua News Agency dispatches of the 27th and 28th) Paris News: The wave of strikes throughout France continues to rise sharply, and workers in all industries have begun a general strike. "As of the 26th, the number of people involved in the strike wave has surged to two million" (United Press). On the 24th, the National Committee of the Dockworkers' Union ordered its affiliated workers to take immediate action. This has caused goods to pile up like mountains in all ports across the country, including Paris, Nantes, Cherbourg, and Le Havre. The National Committee of the Railway Workers' Union issued a notice to all 600,000 of its members to immediately participate in the strike; after the 600,000 railway workers went on strike, stations everywhere were immediately controlled by the strikers, completely halting national railway traffic. Long-distance bus drivers are also scheduled to go on a general strike on the 26th, which will cause France, a country with modern transportation, to revert to the backward state of relying entirely on walking as it did hundreds of years ago, and will seriously threaten the food supply of Paris and many other cities. The National Committee of the Construction Workers' Union and the Committee of the Chemical Workers' Union are holding meetings to discuss the issue of a general strike. The general strike of construction workers in Paris and Livin is still continuing. The nationwide coal mine strike is also deepening. In addition, local strikes are constantly developing. In Paris, gas and food workers have stopped work, postal workers have occupied the General Post Office, and six branches have been closed. All elementary schools are closed. Twenty kinds of French newspapers have been affected by the strike and have been reduced to two pages since the 25th. Thousands of striking workers in Lyon launched a fierce struggle against the suppressing military police on the 26th. The Lyon Police Department was besieged by the angered masses, and the police even used tear gas to suppress them. The surging wave of labor unrest has greatly alarmed the French reactionary authorities. The newly appointed Schuman has been holding cabinet meetings all day long, urgently seeking ways to struggle. On the one hand, he continues to increase the deployment of military police to carry out suppression and "stabilize the situation," and on the other hand, he adopts a delaying tactic, attempting to win time to prepare for further suppression by making temporary partial "concessions." On the 26th, Schuman agreed to some of the workers' demands (increasing temporary family allowances, improving food rations, etc.) and threatened the workers that they "must immediately return to work." However, this move has been jointly rejected by eighteen unions (including metal, construction, coal mining, railway, postal, textile, food, and port transportation unions). National trade unions issued a decision on the evening of the 26th, calling on workers to further strengthen their actions.

　　法各业工人开始总罢工
  　二百万人卷入工潮
    十八个工会联合拒斥舒曼诱迫
    【综合新华社二十七、二十八日电】巴黎讯：全法罢工浪潮继续急剧高涨，各业工人已开始总罢工，“截至二十六日止，罢工浪潮卷入的人数剧增至二百万”（合众社）。二十四日，码头工人工会全国委员会业已下令所属工人立即行动。这使巴黎、南特、瑟堡、勒沙佛尔等全国各港口的货物，堆积如山。铁路工人工会全国委员会通令其全部会员六十万人立即参加罢工；六十万铁路工人实行罢工后，各地车站立即为罢工者所控制，使全国铁路交通完全停顿。长途汽车司机亦定于廿六日总罢工，这将使拥有现代交通工具的法国，退回到数百年以前全靠步行的落后状态，并使巴黎及其他许多城市的粮食供应遭到严重的威胁。建筑工人工会全国委员会及化学工人工会委员会，正开会讨论总罢工问题。而巴黎和里文希的建筑工人之总罢工，则仍继续坚持中。煤矿的全国性罢工也在深入。此外，局部性罢工不断发展。在巴黎，煤气与粮食工人已停工，邮工占领了邮政总局，关闭了六个支局。一切小学校都停课。二十种法文报纸受罢工之影响，于二十五日起改出两版。里昂罢工工人数千人，二十六日对弹压之军警进行猛烈的斗争，里昂警察局遭受激怒群众的包围，警察竟使用催泪弹镇压。澎湃的大工潮，使法国反动当局大为焦急，新上台的舒曼，整日召开阁议，亟谋挣扎之策，一方面仍继续增调军警施行镇压和“稳定形势”，另一方面则采取缓兵之计，力图以暂时之部分“让步”，以争取时间作进一步弹压之准备。舒曼于二十六日答应工人的一部分要求（增加临时家庭津贴，改善粮食配给等），并威胁工人“必须立即复工”。但此举已遭受十八个工会（包括金属、建筑、煤矿、铁路、邮政、纺织、粮食、港口运输等工会）的联合拒斥。全国各工会已于二十六日晚发布决定，呼吁工人进一步加强其行动。
