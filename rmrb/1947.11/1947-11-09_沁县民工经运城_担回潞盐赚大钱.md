    Taiyue, November 6th (Our Newspaper) -- Qin County laborers participated in the war effort and also engaged in transportation, earning two million yuan. On September 29th, 500 laborers from the fifth district of Qin County went out to participate in the war. On October 17th, upon completing their mission and returning to Qin County, when passing by the Yuncheng salt ponds, Comrade An Runsheng, who was leading the team, organized the team he was in charge of to raise funds to carry salt. Everyone sold their remaining new shoes. Two hundred and ninety-five people bought a total of 7,375 jin of salt at a price of 33 yuan per jin. After returning to Qin County and selling it at 250 yuan per jin, they made a net profit of 1,660,9131 yuan. Passing through Wenxi, each person also brought back 1.12 jin of alkali. Five hundred jin of alkali were bought at a price of 100 yuan per jin. After returning to Qin County, each jin could be sold for 750 yuan, earning a net profit of 325,000 yuan. The total profit was 1,994,131 yuan in local currency, which could buy 260 shi of millet at local market prices. An Shuiquan from Jiaokou Village brought 3,000 yuan for expenses and two pairs of shoes when he left home. He sold one pair of shoes in Anyi for 1,800 yuan, used 1,600 yuan to buy 48 jin of salt, and 1,500 yuan to buy 3 jin of cotton. This time he returned with a total profit of 11,964 yuan. His wife happily said, "The mutual aid group in the family has finished harvesting the crops, and you have earned so much money. Winter is not busy, so if there is a task next time, you can go as usual."
