　　[Report from Taiyue, by our newspaper, 10th] Encouraged by poor hired peasants and Communist Party members, two thousand outstanding youths from Gaoping have joined the People's Liberation Army. After the Gaoping County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a call on the 27th of last month to join the army to support the great counter-offensive, poor hired peasants and Communist Party members in various places took the lead in signing up to join the People's Liberation Army in droves. In the First District, the village cadres of Mishan Village rushed to sign up before the conscription call was even finished at the village cadre meeting, followed by seventy-eight village cadres vying to sign up. The deputy director of the militia committee in Jiantou Village, a poor peasant and a Communist Party member, said, "I am a hired worker, and I have turned over a new leaf under the leadership of the Party. In order to defeat Chiang Kai-shek, I volunteer to join the army and lead a platoon." Zhao Zhengxiang's grandmother from Niuzhuang Village personally came to the meeting with a cane to sign up her grandson, Zhao Zhengxiang, saying, "I heard that everyone is joining the army to fight Chiang Kai-shek, so put Zhengxiang's name down too, to avenge me." After Song Huaiyu from Songjiazhuang signed up, he immediately went back and said to his mother, "I've joined the army, are you happy?" His mother said with a smile, "It's better to have a soldier of the Eighth Route Army in the family than a million pounds of gold. It's an honor for the whole family that you're joining the army," which made the whole family laugh. Li Ruiyu of Xiangshuipo already had a "Glorious Enlistment" plaque on his door, and this time he sent his nephew to sign up, wanting to add another one. When Feng Dongrui, the target of struggle from Dongdianshang, signed up, he was immediately opposed by the poor hired peasants: "He used to be a puppet village deputy and should not be allowed to infiltrate our revolutionary ranks, nor should the enemy be allowed to control revolutionary weapons..." Yujing Village also rejected three targets of struggle. Everyone said, "We want to hang the 'Glorious Enlistment' plaque on our own doors." When Li Shun'er, who came from a poor background, asked for approval to marry He Zhixiang's daughter (He was a Kuomintang puppet district chief) after enlisting, everyone said, "No! Even if you don't join the army, you can't be allowed to marry this woman." According to incomplete statistics, two thousand outstanding youths have already signed up to join the army, and they are welcomed, supported, and congratulated everywhere. Various villages are still actively signing up.
