Poor and Hired Core Members Helping Each Other Are Energetic: An Investigation of the Mutual Aid Group in Shuicun Village, Yangcheng

    In order to understand the leadership issue of the poor and hired peasants in the mutual aid group, a survey was conducted in Shuicun Village, Yangcheng. In general, this year's mutual aid production, due to the incomplete land reform movement and the failure to solve the difficulties of the hired and poor peasants, the general characteristics of the mutual aid group are selfishness, formalism, emphasis on sideline occupations and neglect of agriculture, and lack of enthusiasm. Among the several mutual aid groups, only the two mutual aid groups led by Chen Jiaqun and Liu Changshui are better. In the mutual aid in Shuicun, there are three types:

    The first type: the group leader is a poor peasant, but is actually controlled by the target of struggle. Its characteristic is that it emphasizes sideline occupations and neglects agriculture. There is only destruction and no construction. It tries to attack the poor and hired peasants everywhere, and finally squeezes out the poor peasant group leader Ji Quanshi. When Ji Quanshi started to organize mutual aid, although the leadership intentionally handed it over to the poor and hired peasants to lead, because the poor and hired peasants had not formed a force, the leading role could not be developed. The target of struggle took advantage of the loopholes to attack the leadership of the poor and hired peasants and alienate the internal unity of the poor and hired peasants. In addition, because they were afraid of labor, they advocated emphasizing sideline occupations and neglecting agricultural production. In July of this year in the lunar calendar, landlords Huo Tingxiu, Huo Yangshan, etc., pretending to be production experts, deceived the masses to raise shares, and bought back 24 old ewes for 155 yuan per catty (the market price could only sell for 129 yuan per catty), spending more than 50,000 yuan in total. In late September, Huo Tingxiu deceived the masses to sell sheep to the west. Huo was irresponsible on the road, and a large ewe was eaten by wolves, worth more than 10,000 yuan. In addition to wasting 135 herding workers plus the interest on the Xingye Bank loan, it lost more than 80,000 yuan. Each household had to take out more than 1,000 yuan in addition to losing all the original shares. Huo Tingxiu's sugar workshop did not make a penny, and also matched 60 workers and fed four pigs for three months in vain. It sold for more than 10,000 yuan, wasting a total of 285 workers and losing more than 90,000 yuan. There were eleven people in their group, six households were targets of struggle (two of which were not liquidated) and five households were poor and hired peasants. Ji Quanshi was an outsider and served as the group leader. The targets of struggle spoke ill of him in front of other hired and poor peasants, causing everyone to disagree. When it was time to go to the fields, they pretended to be sick. The cows were used to plow the land for them, only used but not fed. When hoeing seedlings, they advocated rotating according to the day, which delayed time, or used the excuse of going out to do business to leave the land barren. Later, they squeezed Ji Quanshi out of the group leader position and replaced him with a group leader who listened to them and engaged in sideline production, and agricultural production became even more laissez-faire and a mess.

    The second type is controlled by middle peasants, and the group leader is also a poor peasant, but also because the poor and hired peasants have not formed a force, they cannot lead. Its characteristic is that everyone takes care of themselves, is selfish, and cannot exchange at equal value. First of all, because the poor and hired peasants have neither material foundations such as livestock nor status, the middle peasants look down on the poor and hired peasants and do not accept the leadership of the poor and hired peasants. As for taking care of the difficulties of the poor and hired peasants, it is even more impossible to talk about. Chen Guantuo's group is a middle peasant group. All ten households in the group are middle peasant components, with seven cattle for plowing. Five are raised independently and two are raised jointly. One household has no cattle. Generally, there are fewer difficulties, and they are not enthusiastic about mutual aid. They are unwilling to engage in mutual aid with households without cattle, for fear of being taken advantage of by the poor and hired peasants. During the spring plowing and sowing, the poor peasant Chen Shimin served as the group leader in the group and was resisted by the entire group. Every morning, people could not be gathered together. This family called Zhang San, and that household called Li Si. When this one came, that one ran away, which wasted a lot of time. In terms of work, he said to Chen Shimin: "When we help others with mutual aid, we really move and work hard, and we top each other one day. When we ask others to pay us back, they either pretend to be sick or shirk and can't take care of it. When they come, they don't do it well. The households that raise cattle plow early and sow early, and the seedlings come out more. We households without cattle plow late and sow late, and most of them don't catch the seedlings. Three acres of grain only yielded nine dou, and there will be nothing to eat this winter." Meetings could not be held, and there were verbal disputes every day, forcing Chen Shimin to be unable to lead and leave the group. After the middle peasants Chen Guantuo and Chen Qunyang became the leaders and deputy leaders, the mutual aid of the group became even more formal. Chen Qunyang said: "In previous years when there was no mutual aid, my cattle could still be sold for a day's work to earn some pocket money. There was often free time to run around, and more grain was harvested. This spring, organizing mutual aid suffered for a whole summer. Not a single day's work was sold, and I had to pay people back with salary rice. The grain was not as much as before." In fact, he himself was unwilling to engage in mutual aid. This group was never organized from beginning to end, and as a result, the entire group of 132 acres of land only harvested 72 shi and 3 dou of grain, an average of 5 dou and 4 sheng and 7 he per acre, which was 2 sheng and 2 he less per acre compared with the average yield of the entire village.

    The third type is that the hired and poor peasants have formed a core. In addition, the Chen Jiaqun group is a group led by poor and hired peasants as the backbone, leading the middle peasants to help each other. It is also the best mutual aid group in the village. Among the fifteen households in the group, only five households are middle peasants, and the rest are poor peasants. Although the group leader Chen Jiaqun is a middle peasant, because he works excellently, can make plans and set rules with everyone, accepts the opinions of the poor and hired peasants, is enthusiastic to serve everyone, and is not afraid of trouble, he can keep up with the poor peasants under the conditions that the poor peasants have an advantage. In this way, the leading role of the poor and hired peasants has also been initially brought into play. The characteristics shown by their group are: (1) Democratic style. On the issue of plowing and eating grass, the initial opinion of the middle peasants was that plowing did not earn work points, and eating grass was enough. However, this autumn, due to the drought and shortage of grass, each hundred catties was priced at 3,000 yuan, and each acre was calculated at one hundred catties, which could top 1 dou and 5 sheng of millet. The poor and hired peasants suffered too much. After renegotiating, it was decided to pay salary rice for plowing (5 catties of grass per acre returned to the original owner). During the spring plowing, Tian Jiasheng and others had no grain to eat. They carried out mutual assistance and adjustment within the group to overcome the difficulties. On the issue of the order of plowing and sowing, it was decided by the group according to needs. They did this during the spring plowing, so most of the land of the middle and poor peasants caught the seedlings. (2) Because the group has greater enthusiasm for production and has mastered the production policy of focusing on agriculture, due to early sowing, deep plowing, and multiple hoeing to fight drought, the entire group of 137 acres of land yielded 94 shi, an average of 6 dou, 8 sheng, and 6 he per acre, an increase of 15 shi, 3 dou, 6 sheng, and 2 he compared with the average number of the entire village. (3) Not only is the group grasping tightly, but it can also be responsible for other groups. When plowing in the autumn, everyone decided not to leave a cow idle and not to engage in odd jobs. Chen Guantuo's mutual aid group did not hold a meeting to convey this, and neglected the autumn plowing. The next day, Chen Gu's cattle were grinding flour for Chen Dangqun and did not plow the land. After it was discovered by Jiaqun's group, Chen Guantuo was criticized, which promoted the autumn plowing. They also introduced their group's methods to other groups. (Taiyue Branch Agency)

　　贫雇骨干互助有劲　阳城水村互助组的调查
    为了了解贫雇在互助组的领导问题，特在阳城水村作了一次调查。总的说，今年的互助生产，由于土改运动不彻底及雇贫困难得不到解决，一般互助组表现出来的特点是，自私自利、形式自流、重副轻农、劲头不大。几个互助组中，仅陈家群、刘长水领导的两个互助组较好。在水村互助中，有三种类型：
    第一种、组长是贫雇，实际上被斗争对象所掌握，其特点重副轻农，只有破坏没有建设，处处设法打击贫雇，终于把贫雇组长姬全士挤出。姬全士开始组织互助时，虽然领导上有意交给贫雇来领导，但因贫雇没有形成力量，领导作用不能发扬，斗争对象从中钻空子，打击贫雇领导，离间贫雇内部团结。此外因他们怕劳动，提倡重副轻农生产。今年阴历七月间，地主霍廷秀、霍仰山等，冒充生产行家，欺骗群众集股，以一百五十五元一斤（市价只能卖一百廿九元一斤），买回二十四只老母羊，共计花了五万多元，九月下旬，霍廷秀又欺骗群众到西边去卖羊，路上霍不负责任，被狼吃了一只大母羊，价值一万多元，除浪费一百三十五个放羊工连上兴业银行贷款利息，共赔本八万多，每户除将原股金赔净，还得拿出一千多元。霍廷秀经理的糖坊，一个钱也没赚，还搭配了六十个工，四口猪白喂了三个月，卖了一万多，总共浪费了二百八十五个工，赔了九万多元钱。他们组里一共有十一个人，六户是斗争对象（其中两户没有清算）五户贫雇。姬全士是外来户，当组长，斗争对象在其他雇贫面前说他坏话，闹得大家不和气。上地他们就装病，牛给他们垡地，光使用不喂。锄苗变工，他们主张按晌轮流，耽误工夫，或借口出去做生意，把地荒了。以后便把姬全士的组长挤掉，换上一个组长，听他们话，搞副业生产，农业生产就更加自流下去，搞得一塌糊涂。
    第二种类型，为中农所掌握，组长亦是贫雇，同样因贫雇没有形成力量，同样领导不起来。其特点各顾各的，自私自利，不能等价交换，首先由于贫雇既没有牲口等物质基础，又没有地位，所以中农看不起贫雇，不接受贫雇领导，至于照顾贫雇困难问题，更无从谈起。陈官土组，是个中农组，全组十户都是中农成份，七个耕牛，有五个是独养、两个伙喂牛，有一户没牛，一般困难较少，对互助不起劲，他们都不愿和没牛户互助，怕吃了贫雇的亏。春耕下种时，贫雇陈石民，在该组当组长，遭到全组的抵抗，每天早晨集合不齐人，东家叫张三、西户唤李四，叫来这个那个跑了，这样浪费时间很多，做活上就和陈石民说的：“咱给人家互助时实实在在的动弹，一天顶一天，叫人家给咱还工时，不是装病便是推诿顾不上，来了也不给好好做，人家养牛户犁的早，种在头，苗出的多，咱这没牛户犁的迟，种的晚，大部都没捉住苗，三亩谷才打了九斗，今冬就没吃的”。开不成会，每天打嘴官司，迫的陈石民无法领导，出了组。中农陈官土、陈群羊当了正副组长以后，该组的互助更成了形式，陈群羊说：“往常年不互助时，我的牛还可以卖个晌，赚几个零花钱，经常有个空，能跑跑，打的粮食还多，今春组织互助，整整受了一夏天，一个晌也没卖，还得倒找人家工资米，粮食也不如以前打的多”。实际上他自己也是不愿互助。这个组自始至终，没有组织起来，结果全组一百三十二亩地，才打了七十二石三斗粮食，每亩平均五斗四升七，和全村平均产量比，每亩少打二升二合。
    第三种类型雇贫已形成核心。另外陈家群组是以贫雇农为骨干，带领中农互助的一个组，也是该村一个最好的互助组。全组十五户中，只有五户中农，其余都是贫农。组长陈家群虽是一个中农，但因他劳动出色，能和大家做计划，订纪律，接受贫雇的意见，热心为大家服务，不怕麻烦，在贫农占优势的条件下，他能跟上贫农走，这样也初步发挥了贫雇的领导作用，他们这个组表现出来的特点是：（一）作风民主。在犁地吃草问题上，开始中农的意见是犁地不赚工钱、吃草就行。可是今秋因天旱草缺，每百斤价洋三千元，每亩按百斤计算，可顶一斗五升小米。雇贫农吃亏太大。重新商讨后，决定犁地出工资米（每亩五斤草归原主）。春耕时田家胜等没粮吃，他们在组内进行互助调剂，克服了困难。在犁种的先后问题上，是由小组按需决定，春耕时他们这样做了，所以中贫农的地大部都捉住苗。（二）由于该组生产劲头较大，掌握了以农业为主的生产方针，由于早种、深犁，多锄抗旱，全组一百三十七亩地，产量九十四石，每亩平均六斗八升六合，和全村平均数比，增加产量十五石三斗六升二合。（三）不但自己组抓的紧，对其他组也能负责。秋垡地时，大家决定不闲一个牛，不顾做零活。陈官土互助组就没开会传达，忽视秋垡，第二天陈古手的耕牛给陈党群磨面没有垡地，被家群组发现后，批评了陈官土一顿，推动了秋垡，他们并把自己组的办法，给别组介绍。（太岳分社）
