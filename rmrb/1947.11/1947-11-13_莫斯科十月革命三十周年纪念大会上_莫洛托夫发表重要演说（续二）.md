　　Compare the Soviet Union with the most highly developed capitalist countries in Europe.

　　Take Britain as an example. For a long time, Britain has been naturally regarded as a highly developed industrial country, even as the "workshop of the world." In the period between the two world wars, there were only a few years when British industrial output rose to exceed the level of 1913, and most of the time it was far below this level. Given this situation, it is difficult to say that British industry made any progress between the two world wars. And even now, as you all know, Britain is in serious economic difficulties and is increasingly dependent on Uncle Sam's assistance.

　　In the same period, French industry did not fare much better, although there were some individual prosperous years. It is enough to mention just one thing: French industrial production before the outbreak of the Second World War only exceeded the level reached before the First World War by six percent. It can be said that French industry stagnated and made no progress throughout the period between the two world wars. France is also experiencing a period of economic difficulty today, and, like Britain, is pinning its hopes on foreign aid.

　　How can this clear contrast between the development of Soviet industry on the one hand, and the situation of British and French industry on the other, be explained? Soviet industrial output increased nearly twelvefold during the interwar period; while British and French industry made no progress, with a slight increase in some years, but stagnation or even decline in most years. How can this be explained? For those who are willing to understand modern development without prejudice, comparing the facts first will yield the answer.

　　As is well known, the fundamental difference between the Soviet Union and Britain and France lies in the fact that the Soviet Union's industry and its entire national economy are built on a socialist foundation. But the industry of Britain and France, like their entire national architecture, is placed on the old capitalist pillars. Moreover, science and practice clearly show that the socialist foundation of the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly solid, while at the same time, the pillars of European capitalist society have long been thoroughly rotten.

　　It is now even clearer how ripe the socialist conditions in our country were thirty years ago, when the victorious socialist revolution brought our country onto a new road—the road of revolutionary revival. Thirty years ago, on the eve of the October Revolution, Lenin ardently argued that it was impossible to move forward without taking steps towards socialism under the historical conditions at that time; and that the material conditions for socialism already existed in our country. He said: "In a Russia of the twentieth century, which has won the republic and democracy by revolutionary means, it is impossible to move forward without advancing towards socialism, without taking steps towards socialism. This is precisely the dialectic of history, i.e., the war very rapidly transforms monopoly capitalism into state-monopoly capitalism; precisely because of this, it also brings mankind very close to socialism. The imperialist war is the eve of the socialist revolution. This is not only because the war with its cruelty promotes the proletarian uprising (if it is not economically mature, no uprising can bring about socialism) - but also because state-monopoly capitalism is the most complete material preparation for socialism, its prelude, a step on the historical ladder, between this step and the step called socialism, there is no intermediate step." Needless to say, the material conditions for Britain and France to transition to socialism were no less favorable than those of our country thirty years ago. But we know that it is not enough to have only material conditions; even to solve those problems that have become a historical necessity, material conditions alone are not enough.

　　The Second World War gave the capitalist system another blow and further shook its position in Europe. The new democratic countries—Yugoslavia, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Albania—relying on the support of the broad masses of the people, carried out bold democratic reforms, such as the elimination of the landlord class, the distribution of land to peasants, and the nationalization of large-scale industries and banks, etc. These countries are taking steps towards socialism along their own independent paths, they have created a life for the working people free from the shackles of capitalists, and are defending their national independence against the attempts of foreign imperialists to place these countries under their power and force them to obey.

　　The Soviet Union has grown up in the midst of attacks by all imperialists, adhering to peace and cooperation, and has achieved victory.

　　From the first day of its establishment, the Soviet Union assumed the responsibility of leading the struggle, thereby determining its position in participating in international affairs. The October Revolution declared peace and unconditionally abandoned the imperialist policies of Tsarist Russia and the government established by the pseudo-socialist Kerensky after the October Revolution, freeing our country from the First World War. Even so, our people could not resume peaceful labor for many years. In order to strangle the October Revolution and restore the power of those landlords and capitalists who had fled abroad, the Entente organized a series of armed interventions against our country, the heinous responsibility for which should be borne by British and French imperialism and their allies the United States and Japan, and their then vassals. This piratical policy, filled with the bestial hatred of Churchill, Clemenceau, and other reactionaries for the revolutionary Russian people, failed shamefully. The Soviet people insisted on their independence, gained rest, and began to embark on the road of victorious peaceful socialist construction. As you all know, even after this, the conspiracies against our country did not stop. Imperialists from the West and the East spared no effort to thwart our peaceful construction labor, even to the point that Britain and France joined forces with fascist Italy and signed the shameful Munich Agreement with Hitler's Germany, in order to prompt the German fascist bandits to attack the Soviet Union more quickly. However, the British and French imperialists miscalculated. They fell into the trap they had arranged themselves. Stalin's wise policy of peace brilliantly ensured that the Soviet Union was able to postpone the war once again. But when Hitler's Germany finally attacked the Soviet Union, the hopes of our enemies were restored. We know that shortly after the outbreak of the war, such news appeared in London, namely that British cabinet member Moore-Brabazon, in discussing the situation on the Soviet-German battlefield in the summer of 1941, unhesitatingly revealed a wish that the Soviet and German forces would exhaust each other's strength, while Britain would strengthen its strength in the meantime and become the ruling power. There were also some people in the United States who were deeply afraid of falling slightly behind Moore-Brabazon. In June 1941, The New York Times published a statement by a famous American saying: "If we see that Germany is about to win, we must help Russia, but if Russia is about to win, then we must help Germany. The more fiercely they kill each other, the better."

　　Nevertheless, in the war against Hitler's Germany, the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States cooperated successfully against the common enemy—the common enemy of all democratic countries. (To be continued)

　　莫斯科十月革命三十周年纪念大会上
    莫洛托夫发表重要演说（续二）
    把苏联和欧洲最高度发展的资本主义国家比较一下。
    以英国为例。很久以来，英国就当然地被认为是高度发展的工业国，甚至被认为是“世界工厂”。在两次世界大战之间的时期内，只有很少几年英国工业产额曾上升到超过一九一三年的水平，大多数时间都大大低于这一水平。情形如此，就很难说英国工业在两次世界大战之间，有何进展。而且甚至现在，正如你们大家所知道的，英国正处在严重的经济困难中，并且越来越依赖山姆大叔的援助了。
    在同一时期，法国的工业也没有较好的进展，虽然曾有过个别景气的年份。只要说到一件事就够了，法国工业产量在第二次世界大战爆发前，比起第一次世界大战前所达到的水平来，仅仅超过百分之六。可以说，在两次世界大战之间的整个时期，法国工业都在原地踏步而毫无进展。法国今天也在经历着经济困难的时期，并且如英国一样，将其希望寄托在国外援助上。
    一方面是苏联工业的发展，另一方面是英、法工业的情况，这个彰明昭著的对比怎样来说明呢？苏联工业产量，在两次世界大战之间的间歇期间，增加了近十二倍；而英、法工业却没有进展，有几年略见上升，而在大部分年头则一直停滞甚至下降，这又怎样来说明呢？对于愿意理解现代发展而无偏见的人，先把事实对比一下，就可以得到答案了。
    众所周知，苏联与英、法之基本区别在于：苏联的工业和它的整个国民经济是建筑在社会主义基础上的。但是英国以及法国的工业。象它们的整个国家建筑一样，是放在旧的资本主义支柱上的。不仅如此，科学与实践都明白说明：苏联社会主义的基础是日益坚固，而与此同时，欧洲资本主义社会的支柱却早已彻头彻尾腐烂不堪了。
    现在已更加明显，三十年前，当胜利的社会主义革命将我国带上新的道路——革命复兴的道路——的时候，我国社会主义的条件是多么成熟。三十年前，在十月革命的前夕，列宁热切地辩论说：按当时历史条件，不采取走向社会主义的步骤，就不可能前进；又说，我国社会主义的物质条件已经存在。他说：“在一个已以革命手段赢得共和与民主的二十世纪的俄国，不向社会主义迈进，不采取走向社会主义的步骤，就不可能前进。这正是历史的辩证法，即战争非常加速地把独占资本主义转变为国家——独占资本主义；正因为这样，也就使人类非常接近于社会主义了。帝国主义战争是社会主义革命的前夕。这不仅是因为战争以其惨酷性促成无产阶级的起义（如果经济上没有成熟，则任何起义都不可能带来社会主义），——而且还因为国家——独占资本主义是社会主义最充分的物质准备，是它的前奏，是历史阶梯的一步，在这一步与叫做社会主义的那一步之间，没有中间的一步。”不消说，三十年前当英、法两国转变到社会主义的物质条件，其有利程度不亚于我国。但我们知道，仅仅有物质条件是不够的，即令要解决那些已成为历史的必要性的问题，光靠物质条件，也还是不够的。
    第二次世界大战给资本主义制度以另一个打击，并且进一步动摇了它在欧洲的地位。新民主国家——南斯拉夫、波兰、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、捷克斯拉夫、匈牙利、阿尔巴尼亚——依靠广大人民群众的支持，进行了大胆的民主改革，如消灭地主阶级，将土地交给农民，大规模工业与银行的国有化等等。这些国家正按照它们自己独立的道路采取迈向社会主义的步骤，它们已经给劳动人民创造了不受资本家束缚的生活，并且为反对外国帝国主义者妄想将这些国家置于其权力之下，并强使这些国家听命于它的企图，而保卫它们民族的独立。
    苏联在一切帝国主义的夹攻中成长，坚持和平，坚持合作，取得了胜利。
    苏联从立国的第一天起，便担负了领导斗争的责任，从而确定了自己在参与国际事务上的地位。十月革命宣布和平，并无保留地放弃沙俄及十月革命后由伪社会主义者克伦斯基所成立的政府的帝国主义政策，使我国摆脱了第一次世界大战。虽然如此，我国人民还有许多年不能恢复和平的劳动。协约国为了绞杀十月革命，恢复那些潜逃国外的地主与资本家的权力，组织了一连串对我国的武装干涉，这些罪恶的责任应由英、法帝国主义及其美、日同盟国与当时它们的附庸国担负。这种海盗式的政策，充满了邱吉尔、克里蒙梭及其他反动派对于革命的俄国人民的兽性的仇恨，是可耻地失败了。苏联人民坚持了他们的独立，获得了休息，并且开始走上胜利的和平的社会主义建设的道路。你们大家知道甚至在这以后，反对我国的阴谋并未停止。西方与东方的帝国主义者不惜一切想挫败我国和平的建设劳动，甚至于达到这样的地步，英、法两国竟与法西斯意大利联合起来，并与希特勒德国签订了可耻的慕尼黑协定，以便促使德国法西斯匪徒更快地进攻苏联。然而，英、法帝国主义者算错了。他们坠入了他们自己安排的陷井里。而斯大林英明的和平政策，却辉煌地保证苏联得以再次延缓了战争。但当希特勒德国终于进攻苏联的时候，我们的敌人的希望又恢复了。我们知道：战争爆发后不久，伦敦就出现了这样的消息，即英国阁员摩尔·布拉巴松在研讨一九四一年夏季苏德战场的形势时，毫不迟疑地透露出一种愿望，希望苏军和德军彼此相互消耗力量，而英国则就中增强其力量而成为统治的强国。美国也有这样一些人，他们深恐稍微落于摩尔·布拉巴松之后。一九四一年六月，纽约时报刊登了一位大名鼎鼎的美国人的声明说：“如果我们看到德国行将战胜，我们就必须帮助俄国，但如果俄国行将获胜，那我们就必须帮助德国。他们互相残杀得愈凶愈好。”
    虽然如此，在反对希特勒德国的战争中，苏联、英国和美国曾顺利地合作，反对共同敌人，——一切民主国家的共同敌人。（未完待续）
