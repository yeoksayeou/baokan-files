　　Changzi Relaxes Leadership
  　Most Autumn Land Unplowed
    [Our Newspaper Taiyue Eleventh Dispatch] Changzi has relaxed leadership over autumn plowing, and most of the county's land remains unplowed. Since a large number of labor and livestock have joined the army and the war effort, there are indeed difficulties in terms of labor and livestock. Coupled with the past emphasis on sideline occupations over agriculture, the leadership has not vigorously organized and led, and a spontaneous trend of thought has formed. Currently, only about three-tenths of the land has been plowed. Baodian Town is particularly serious, with only one-quarter plowed. According to statistics from East Street, out of more than fifty livestock in the whole street, except for more than ten cattle, the remaining forty-plus mules and donkeys are engaged in transportation. Until recently, the town government, seeing that the land was about to be unplowed, had to convene a cadre meeting on the 3rd of this month to mobilize for autumn plowing, and stipulated: (1) Before the autumn plowing is completed, no travel permits will be issued for outside transportation; (2) In order to take care of livestock wages, the wage for plowing one mu of land was re-stipulated to be eight sheng of millet, and rolling the land one mu to be five sheng of millet; (3) All rice milling and flour grinding must not interfere with the livestock's plowing. From the 4th, all livestock started a concentrated effort to plow the land.
    [Our Newspaper Taiyue Eleventh Dispatch] Fushan, starting around October 20th, organized all and semi-able-bodied labor to make a concentrated effort on autumn plowing. The Fifth District, at the district-wide cadre expansion meeting, emphasized organizing to complete autumn plowing. In addition to all and semi-able-bodied labor going to the fields, all five hundred and ninety-four head of livestock were also organized to make a concentrated effort to plow the land. The six villages of Dishang, Cūnshùyuán, Hancun, Yangjiahe, Xichi, and Sunzhai first plowed the land of military dependents, revolutionary martyrs, and participating civilian laborers, and then their own land. Women such as Wu Fengying and Wu Lianying in Dishang Village learned to handle the plow, and all one thousand two hundred and seventy mu of autumn land in the village has been plowed. Some women in the other villages of Hancun and Yangjiahe have also learned to plow the land and will soon be able to complete it. Cadres in various villages of the Fourth District paid great attention to autumn plowing and personally went to the fields to lead. Wang Baocai of Shibicun led the mutual aid teams of five base villages to carry out autumn plowing, and has now plowed over one thousand five hundred mu. The mutual aid teams in each village have also launched competitions, aiming to completely plow all autumn land within twenty days. Their slogan is: "Plow the new land this year, and the granaries will not be empty next year." Cuicun started on the 21st and completed plowing all three thousand one hundred mu of autumn land in the village in four days. In addition, Donglucheng Village and Gecun in the First District, Zhaojiayuan and Zhaochengghe in the Second District, and Renxin, Licun, and Shanqu in the Third District are now making every effort to plow the land, and have extracted one thousand two hundred and fifty-eight women and students to help military dependents and revolutionary martyrs plow the land in various villages. Zhao Lan Ying and Li Fengying, women in Zhaochengghe, plowed twenty-five mu of land for military dependents in half a month in addition to sowing seeds. Eighteen students from Licun School District plowed land for military martyrs in Zhangjiapo, Licun, Zaogou and other villages for half a month.
