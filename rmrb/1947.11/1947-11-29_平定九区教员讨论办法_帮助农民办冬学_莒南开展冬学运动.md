　　【Report from Pingding】The Ceyu United School District in Pingding's Ninth District convened a meeting of all teachers in the school district on the 14th of this month to discuss how to return to their villages and run winter schools well, so that liberated peasants can become culturally liberated. Everyone conducted a thorough review of past shortcomings and proposed that in order to help run winter schools well this winter, six essentials must be grasped: First, good liberated peasants must be selected as volunteer teachers through detailed review by the masses. Second, close contact must be made with village cadres to run winter schools together. Third, it must be combined with central work. Fourth, take the initiative to participate in winter school lectures on current affairs. Fifth, deepen current affairs education in mountain villages and small villages. Sixth, do our best to consistently run winter schools well. (Yu Zhen)
　　【Xinhua News Agency, East China, 23rd】Junan County (newly established county) in Binhai convened a meeting of propaganda and youth work cadres from all counties and townships in late last month to discuss the winter school movement. All districts reflected the masses' urgent need for culture. In Nanzhuang, Xunhe, not a single person is literate, and when the district sends a notice, they have to find someone from another village to read it. When Songzhuangzi distributed fruit, they still used the landlord's bookkeeping. The masses said, "Liberation, liberation, culture is never liberated." The meeting decided that this winter, the county, district, township, and village will work together. The county will train cooperative accountants and teachers from private schools, the district will train village teachers and general cooperative accountants, and the township will train young teachers.
　　【Another report】After the autumn plowing and autumn planting were completed, liberated peasants in various villages in Shichang Township, Zhifang District, Junan County, have been drumming and beating gongs for days, leading livestock to welcome teachers to prepare for winter schools. Because the township's sixteen villages had previously elected 160 outstanding youths from poor, hired, and middle peasant backgrounds by the farmers' association, they were reviewed by the township farmers' association and received short-term training to serve as winter school teachers.
