Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 14th: The Northeast Railway Bureau convened an enlarged meeting of the Northeast Railway Party Committee from October 9th to 21st. The meeting conveyed Comrade Li Fuchun's summary report from the financial and economic conference. Based on the spirit of that report, the meeting reviewed the work of the past year in operations, labor union activities, and Party affairs, and defined the current main tasks: (1) To complete the arduous winter transportation tasks with a fighting spirit. At the same time, to prepare for development in terms of manpower and resources. (2) To call on all employees (especially cadres) to study technology and master their jobs, so that employees' political awareness, labor enthusiasm, and technical skills are combined. (3) To launch a mass-based meritorious service campaign across the entire railway system, with the aim of completing winter transportation, and to further improve the labor union during the campaign. (4) To strengthen ideological education within the Party in order to raise the political and ideological level of Party members.

The meeting considered the work achievements of the past six months to be developmental: such as the consolidation of finance and personnel, the establishment of a budget and final accounts system, and the treasury and materials system, which laid the initial foundation for enterprise management. In addition, with the cooperation of employees and the broad masses of liberated people, 1,400 li of new railways were built, a railway college was established, passenger train speeds increased from 40 kilometers per hour to 50 kilometers per hour, coal consumption was reduced from 72 kilograms per kilometer to 51 kilograms per kilometer, and 41.5 percent of material expenses were saved under the principle of self-reliance. Through anti-corruption education, employee awareness has been raised, corruption has gradually decreased, and theft has been virtually eliminated.

The meeting focused on reviewing certain incorrect thoughts and work styles, pointing out shortcomings existing in railway work. For example, the top-down implementation of service viewpoints and war viewpoints was insufficient, the planning of various tasks was inadequate, skills were not refined, systems were not strict, and leading bodies at all levels still had more or less bureaucratic work styles. The meeting emphasized that in order to move work forward, the first priority is to strive to master the close combination of operations, politics, and technology, and to closely combine the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses with scientific management. Second, it is necessary to strengthen unified leadership, and to define the relationships between the General Bureau and the Management Bureaus, and between the departments of the General Bureau and the divisions of the Management Bureaus, more clearly and rationally, so as to facilitate consistent steps from top to bottom and form a unified whole.

　　东北铁路党委会议
    检讨业务确定任务
    【新华社东北十四日电】东北铁路总局于十月九日至二十一日召开东北铁路党委扩大会议传达了李富春同志财经会议的总结报告，并依据该报告的精神检讨了一年来的业务、工运和党务等工作，确定了当前的主要任务：（一）要以战斗的姿态，完成繁重的冬季运输。同时，在人力与物力上准备发展。（二）号召全体员工（特别是干部）学习技术，熟练业务，使员工的政治觉悟、劳动热忱与技术业务相结合。（三）以完成冬季运输为目的，在全路开展群众性的立功竞赛运动，在运动中更加健全工会。（四）加强党内思想教育，以提高党员的政治思想水平。
    会议对过去半年来的工作成绩认为是发展的：如财政人事的整顿，建立预决算制度及金库、材料制度，奠定了企业化的初步基础。此外，半年来在员工与广大翻身人民合作下，修筑了一千四百里新铁路，建立铁路学院，客车行速从每小时四十公里增加到五十公里，节省煤从一公里需七十二公斤到一公里五十一公斤，在自力更生原则下节省了百分之四十一点五的材料经费。在反贪污教育下，员工觉悟提高，贪污现象已逐渐减少，盗窃则已迫于绝迹。
    会议着重检讨了某一些不正确的思想和作风，指出铁路工作中存在着的缺点，例如自上而下的贯澈服务观点与战争观点不够，各种工作的计划性不够，业务不精，制度不严，各级领导机构仍存在着或多或少的官僚主义作风。会议强调提出：为使工作前进一步，首先要努力掌握业务、政治与技术的密切结合，把群众的积极性创造性与科学管理密切结合起来。其次，就是加强统一领导，将总局与管理局及总局各部与管理局各处的关系，规定的更为明确与合理，便于上下步调一致，结成一体。
