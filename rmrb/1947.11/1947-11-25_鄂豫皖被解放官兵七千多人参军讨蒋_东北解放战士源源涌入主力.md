Xinhua News Agency, Eyuwan Front, 23rd: More than 7,000 officers and soldiers of the Chiang army who were liberated in the Jieling Gaoshanpu battle have voluntarily joined the People's Liberation Army. They only underwent a short 20 days of study. The People's Liberation Army's declaration particularly excited them. Those whose homes are in the liberated areas are eager to notify their families as soon as possible, explaining that they are no longer "doomed soldiers" but People's Liberation Army soldiers, and hope to gloriously obtain the land they deserve in the land reform. One day, the regimental headquarters of a certain regiment received many letters from liberated soldiers requesting notification of their families. Chen Silai from Shitui Village, Tangyin, woke up the instructor in the middle of the night and demanded that he write a letter to his family immediately, saying: If you don't write it for me, I won't be able to sleep.

Xinhua News Agency, Yushan Front, 23rd: The Yu-Shaan People's Liberation Army released its first batch of 72 captured officers on the 18th. They were all affiliated with the 15th Division, the 3rd Reorganized Division, and local teams. Some of them had been captured and released in the Southwest Shandong area, and now they were captured and released for the second time. The People's Liberation Army provided them with sufficient travel expenses and food.

Xinhua News Agency, Sulu Yuwan Front, 23rd: The People's Liberation Army recently released 304 officers, including Liang Yu, lieutenant colonel and deputy commander of the 12th Regiment of the 57th Reorganized Division of the Chiang Army, Du Chengren, company instructor, and Shen Zhonghao, major military law officer of the division headquarters, who were captured in the Shatuji battle in Southwestern Shandong. Before parting, many of those released burst into tears. A deputy company commander choked and said: "We used to brutally kill the people and were enemies of the people. After being captured this time, you repaid our grievances with kindness, and gave us care and education. Now you are also providing us with funds to return to our hometowns. We are not made of wood or stone, how can we be without emotion? In the future, we will never forget the kindness of the people."

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 23rd: The military and civilians on the Siping front warmly welcomed 2,200 liberated soldiers who gloriously joined the Democratic Allied Army. Companies held discussion meetings and entertainment parties respectively. At the welcome meeting of a certain unit, labor hero and model Suan Guoren encouraged the liberated soldiers with his own experience. He was originally a squad leader of the 88th Division of the 71st Army of the Chiang Army. He was liberated and joined our army in the Dawa battle last year. After the grievance airing movement, he bravely took the lead in the summer offensive and was the first to break into Decheng, winning the glorious title of labor hero and model, and was promoted from soldier to deputy platoon leader. His glorious deeds gave the liberated soldiers great encouragement. Many liberated soldiers immediately made their own meritorious service plans after arriving at their companies.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 19th: Chiang's army officers and soldiers liberated in various parts of Northeast China have generally improved their awareness after learning and airing their grievances. Whole batches of them are requesting to join the Democratic Allied Army. After the Qiqihar People's Liberation Army Training Regiment celebrated the autumn offensive victory, more than 2,500 people collectively requested to go to the front line to destroy Chiang and avenge their families. The Jilin People's Liberation Army Training Regiment put forward the slogan: "Overthrow Chiang Kai-shek, eradicate the root of all suffering," and 588 people have already poured into a certain unit of the Democratic Allied Army. The 6th Battalion, composed of more than a thousand Yunnan liberated soldiers on the Ji (Lin) South Front, has transformed from airing grievances and seeking revenge to a large-scale military training, and has now been put into the main counter-offensive force. The officers and soldiers liberated in the autumn offensive have been distributed to various places. More than 500 officers above the rank of lieutenant of the 116th Division of the 53rd Army and the 390th Regiment of the 130th Division, who laid down their arms in the Weiyuanpu battle, have arrived at the Liaodong People's Liberation Army Officer Training Brigade and begun studying "On New Democracy," launching criticism and self-criticism, and brewing frank grievance airing. 1,500 liberated officers and soldiers of the Changchun-Shenyang section of the Chinese Changchun Railway have also arrived at a certain rear area of ours, all dressed in new cotton clothes, and are participating in study life.
