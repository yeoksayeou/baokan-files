New Approaches to Class Education in the Troops

    I. Comparison Exhibition
    During the grievance-airing movement, a certain battalion in Liaodong borrowed the spoils and treasures of local landlords who had been struggled against, and the tattered clothing of the poor, to create a comparison exhibition. The landlords' bedding, blankets, silks, furs, and opium pipes were all marked with their value, converted to the then-current grain prices, explaining how much rent the poor needed to pay. For example, a landlord's sable robe was equivalent to twenty-one years of food and clothing for a poor person. On the other hand, the "ancestral" cotton socks, pillows used for decades, and ragged broken pots of the poor were marked with how many years they had been used. At the exhibition, cadres and activists provided explanations, turning the dead objects into living teaching materials, greatly enhancing the class consciousness of the soldiers.
    The exhibition also included the explanation of comic strips. Zhang Fugui, the most deeply suffering person in the Second Company, told his tragic history to the clerk, who drew it out frame by frame in color. At the exhibition, Zhang Fugui himself pointed to the pictures and told everyone: "This is my dad being crushed to death in the Kailping coal mine and thrown into the mass grave, this is my sister being sold to the landlord as a servant because my family was poor, this is my mom dying without a place to bury her..." As he spoke, he choked with sobs, and those who listened also felt heartbroken. Everyone began to recount their own suffering.
    II. Oath Before the Shrine
    During the grievance-airing movement, after full deliberation and preparation, a certain regiment solemnly erected a mourning hall, decorated with white cloth strips and colorful flowers. In the center of the hall were two spirit tablets, with the words "Spirits of Martyrs Sacrificed for the Class Cause" and "Spirits of Deceased Parents, Uncles, and Grandfathers" written in white characters on blue paper. On both sides were arranged small spirit tablets with many names. During the oath-taking ceremony, everyone solemnly lined up and entered the mourning hall. The instructor, on behalf of everyone, offered sacrifices, observed a moment of silence in mourning, and then the poorest soldier took the oath. Wu Chuan'en said: "Mom! You died without even finding a pit to bury you in. In the past, when I raised my head, the east was full of enemies, the west was full of oppressors. Only when I found the Communist Party did I find the home of the poor." During the oath-taking, some liberated soldiers excitedly took out KMT insignia and gold rings and handed them over to their superiors, expressing their determination to work for the people to the end.

　　部队阶级教育新方式
    雪立
    一、对比展览会
    辽东某营在诉苦运动中借用本地斗争地主的浮财宝物，和穷人的破烂衣物对比的布置了一个展览会。把地主的被褥毛毯绸缎皮货，以及大烟枪上都标明了价值，折合当时粮价，说明需要穷人多少租子，如地主的一件貂皮袍子就折合了一个穷人二十一年的吃穿。另外是穷人的“祖传”棉袜，用过几十年的枕头，破衣烂盆，标明这些东西用了多少年月。会上有干部和积极分子加以说明，把死的实物变成活的教材，大大提高战士们的阶级觉悟。
    在展览会中又进行了连环画的讲解，二连受苦最深的张富贵把自己的悲惨历史讲给文书，由文书把它用彩色一幅幅衔接的画出。在展览会上由张富贵自己指着画向大家讲：“这是俺爹轧死在开平煤坑被撩进万人坑，这是俺姐因为家穷卖给地主当丫头，这是俺娘死了没处埋……讲着讲着就泣不成声了，听的人也都为之心酸，一个个也都诉起自己的苦来。
    二、灵前宣誓
    某团在诉苦运动中经过充分的酝酿准备，隆重的扎了一个灵棚，用白布条扎了些花彩，棚中央供了两个牌位，以蓝纸白字写着：“为阶级事业牺牲烈士之灵”，“死难父母叔伯大爷之灵”，两边排列着许多名字的小牌位。宣誓时大家肃穆地列队走进灵堂，指导员代表全体献祭后，静默志哀，接着由最贫苦的战士宣誓，吴传恩说：“娘呀！你死了连个坑也找不到埋你，俺过去抬起头来望望东边是仇人，西边是冤家，最后才找到共产党，找到了穷人的家。”在宣誓中有些解放战士激动得掏出蒋军的符号、金戒指交给上级，表示坚决为人民干到底。
