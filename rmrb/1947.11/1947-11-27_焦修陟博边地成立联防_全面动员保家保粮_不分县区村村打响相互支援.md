　　Border Area of Jiaozuo, Xiuwu, Zhizuo, and Bo'ai Establishes Joint Defense
  　Fully Mobilizing to Protect Homes and Grain
    Villages Across Counties and Districts Unite in Mutual Support
    [Our newspaper's Henan North dispatch] To protect their homes and defend themselves, and to stop Chiang Kai-shek's bandit Wang Fengying from combining with special agents to loot, the masses in the border area of Jiaozuo, Xiuwu, Wuzhi, and Bo'ai gathered over 500 militiamen on November 6th in a certain village to formally announce the establishment of the Joint Defense Command for the Jiaozuo, Xiuwu, Zhizuo, and Bo'ai Border Area. In the ten days before and after the establishment of the joint defense, they have managed to launch attacks in villages across county and district lines, mutually support each other, repelled several small-scale night raids by the Wang bandits, and proactively attacked and occupied Jiahetun, a key stronghold of the Chiang bandits.
    The border area Joint Defense Command is divided into five large joint defense zones and eight small joint defense zones, with over 800 militiamen under its command. Lian Zhizhong, a comrade from the Jiaozuo City Armed Forces Committee, was selected as the commander of the joint defense, and Comrade Xie ×× as the deputy commander. Uniform numbers, passwords, and contact signals were established. The joint defense has three tasks: first, to organize joint attacks of various sizes; second, to provide mutual support; and third, to exchange intelligence. It also proposed "three don'ts" (don't shoot if you can't see the enemy, don't shoot if it's not the enemy, don't shoot if you can't hit!), and three "do's" (attack when the enemy comes, aim and shoot, shoot decisively!). The masses said, "With more people, we have more strength, so we are not afraid!" Militiamen in Gou Village said, "What are we afraid of with so many people? Let's go get them tonight, we're not afraid even if there are three or two hundred (enemies)!"
    Before the establishment of the joint defense, on the night of November 2nd, over 30 members of the Wuzhi Ningguo puppet "township office," carrying a machine gun, raided and looted Xiaoma Village in Wuzhi. The Jiaozuo City Public Security Team, the Fan Keqin militia team, and the Qinyang rotation team all rushed to the village to provide support. The enemy fled in panic, and the militiamen seized two livestock, five quilts, and a bicycle, all of which were returned to the masses. The masses in Xiaoma Village automatically慰劳ed the Jiaozuo City armed units with a sheep, and everyone loved and united each other to strike at the enemy. On the nights of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th, the puppet "self-defense corps" from Fucheng and other villages came to Lingquanbei Village three times. The first time, they were repelled by the Lingquanbei and Fucheng militiamen using hand grenades. The second and third times, they stepped on three landmines and fled with injuries. On the 10th, the Ningguo militiamen, in coordination with our North and South Gou Village militiamen, attacked Xindian to carry out political offensives, posting slogans. Comrade Bai Xihai led the militiamen on a night patrol of Beizhang Village, driving away small groups of the puppet "self-defense corps" who were robbing grain at night, intercepting three carrying poles, four pockets, and more than one *shi* of grain.
    After the establishment of the joint defense, small armed groups were organized to launch continuous, rotating attacks, using small groups against small groups, and night against night. The Yang Juhe rotation team repelled over 100 enemy raiders in three groups on the night of the 9th. The other two small groups of enemies fled without a fight upon hearing the gunfire. On the same night, the Fan Keqin militia team also repelled over ten raiders from the Li Wan "self-defense corps." On the night of the 10th, the Taihang Fourth Military Sub-district's backbone armed forces, the Xiuyu Column, in coordination with the Yang Juhe rotation team, captured the enemy stronghold of Jiahetun, seizing eight rifles, killing three members of the puppet "self-defense corps," capturing two, arresting three evil bullies and counter-settlement elements, and liberating seven masses (masses captured from Fucheng).
    Children in Nanzhang Village dig fortifications, the self-defense team builds gun emplacements, transforms the terrain, fires homemade cannons, and women make stone mines. Six villages, including Nanzhang, made over a hundred in two days. Beizhang and Yangzhuang villages dug rivers to divert water, cut off roads, and laid mines, creating a water mine-combined array. Wang Guiying, a female militiaman from Nanzhang, made stone mines during the day and stood guard at night. Women and old ladies who fed livestock all stood guard. The masses in Nanzhuang Village said, "We were afraid when the troops stayed in the village a few days ago, but now we are not afraid even if the militiamen don't stay in the village." Hu Zhirui, the district chief of the first district, personally organized and reviewed the militiamen, insisted on staying in the Nanzhang stronghold at night, and supported the masses. The rear supports the front by making stone mines; the front insists on protecting the rear. Gengzhuang supports Liwan, Nanzhang supports Yangzhuang, and stone mines are made and transported to the front. The masses in Yangzhuang Village borrowed "flying birds" (200-jin homemade cannons) and "Old White Dragon" (600-jin homemade cannons) from Gengzhuang Village. The masses in the stronghold saw this and said, "If we had known this method earlier, we wouldn't have relocated!" They also set up earthen guns and cannons. Lian Zhizhong, the commander of the joint defense, personally trained over a hundred demolitionists, teaching them how to make, load, and bury stone mines. When they were tested, everyone clapped and cheered, "Really fierce!" "Really powerful!" An old man in Xiaoma Village picked up a stone shard and said, "Stone eggs can also hit the enemy, what are we afraid of?!"
    As a result, everywhere there were earthen guns, cannons, stone mines, and landmines. Villages set off thunder and arranged minefields. A mass-based guerrilla war to protect fields, grain, and homes became widespread. The Qinyang rotation team, as well as the Yang Juhe and Fan Keqin militia teams, in coordination with the Taihang Military Sub-district's backbone armed forces, the Xiuyu Column, constantly operated day and night in the Zaodian, Dianhou, Xindian, and Haozhuang areas (five li from Jiaozuo). The puppet *baochang* and the masses in the Chiang-controlled area contacted us one after another to hand over public grain. ××× of Jiahetun said to the head of the self-defense corps, Principal Lu, "You are still pretending to be confused. The People's Liberation Army's counter-offensive in Henan is a great victory. Within a few *li*, it's all Eighth Route Army!" In a few days, four or five villages contacted us and handed over more than forty *shi* of public grain. The masses in ×× Village automatically supported the Eighth Route Army's counter-offensive grain and demanded the return of the "glorious receipt" (public grain receipt from the democratic government).

　　焦修陟博边地成立联防
  　全面动员保家保粮
    不分县区村村打响相互支援
    【本报豫北讯】焦作、修武、武陟、博爱边地群众要求保家自卫，阻止蒋记土匪王凤英结合特务抢掠，于是在十一月六号集结民兵五百余人，在某村正式宣告成立焦修陟博边地联防指挥部。在联防成立前后十天内，已经作到不分县区界线村村打响，相互支援，打退王匪（凤英）数次夜间小股出扰，并主动出击占领蒋匪心脏据点嘉禾屯。
    边地联防指挥部划分五个大联防、八个小联防，下辖民兵八百余人，选出焦作市武委会连志忠同志为联防正指挥，谢××同志为副指挥，统一规定番号、口令、联络记号。联防任务有三：第一、组织联合大小股出击；第二、互相支援；第三、互通情报。并提出了“三不打”（看不见敌人不打，不是敌人不打，打不住不打）、三打（敌来必打，瞄准打，坚决打！）群众说：“人多力量大，这可不怕啦！”苟村民兵说：“我们有这么多人还怕啥？今夜去搞他，有三百二百（敌人）也不怕！”
    联防成立前，十一月二号夜里，武陟宁郭伪“乡公所”三十余人，携机枪一挺，袭扰抢掠武陟小马村时、焦市公安队、范克勤民兵队、沁阳轮战队就都扑向该村支援，敌仓惶逃窜，民兵夺获牲口二头、被子五条、自行车一辆，都交归群众；小马村群众自动慰劳焦市各武装单位羊一只，大家相亲相爱团结一致打击敌人。三、四、五号夜，府城等村伪“自卫团”三次到灵泉碑村，第一次被我灵泉碑、府城民兵用手榴弹击退，第二、三次踏响三个地雷，带伤而窜。十号，宁郭民兵配合我南北苟村民兵出击新店开展政攻，张贴标语。白喜孩同志带民兵夜巡北张庄，打跑伪“自卫团”小股夜间抢粮，截下扁担三条、口袋四条、粮食一石多。
    联防成立后，组织小股武装，多头不断轮回出击，以小股对小股，以黑夜对黑夜。杨聚和轮战队于九号夜打回敌人三股百余人出扰；另两小股敌人听到枪声不战而逃。同日夜，范克勤民兵队也打回李万“自卫团”十余人出扰。十号夜，太行四分区基干武装修获纵队，配合杨聚和轮战队，攻下嘉禾屯敌据点，得步枪八枝，打死伪“自卫团”三名，俘二名，捉奸霸倒算分子三名，解放群众七人（府城被俘群众）。
    南张村儿童挖工事，自卫队修炮台，改造地形，打土炮，妇女打石雷，南张等六个村两天打了一百多个，北张、杨庄村挖河引水断路埋雷、布置水雷结合阵。南张女民兵王贵英等白天打石雷，晚上站岗，妇女、老太太喂牲口的都站岗。南庄群众说：“前几天队伍在村住还怕，现在民兵不在村住也不怕了。”一区区长胡之锐同志，亲自整理审查民兵，夜间坚持南张大寨，给群众撑腰壮胆。后方打石雷支援前方；前方坚持保护后方。耿庄支援李万，南张支援杨庄，打成石雷往前运。杨庄群众向耿庄借回“过山鸟”（二百斤重的土炮）、“老白龙”（六百斤重的土炮），大寨群众看到了说：“早知这办法，咱就不转移啦！”就也把土枪土炮架起来。联防正指挥连志忠同志亲自集训爆炸手百余人，学习石雷的打法、装法、埋法。试放的时候，大家拍手高呼：“真凶呀！”“真厉害！”小马村一个老汉把石头片拾回说：“石头蛋还能打敌人，这还怕啥？！”
    于是，到处都是土枪土炮、石雷、地雷，村村打雷布置雷区；群众性保田、保粮、保家自卫的游击战争普遍开展起来。沁阳轮战队及杨聚和、范克勤民兵队，配合分区基干武装修获纵队，白天黑夜不断到造店、店后、新店、郝庄（距焦作五里）一带活动。蒋区伪保长、群众纷纷与我接头，交公粮。嘉禾屯×××对自卫团长卢校长说：“你还装糊涂，解放军河南反攻大胜利，出不了几里，都是八路军！”在几天中，与我接头的就有四五个村，交公粮四十余石，××村群众自动拥护八路军反攻粮，要回“光荣条”（民主政府公粮收据）。
