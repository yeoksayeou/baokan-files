Underestimating the Enemy and Complacency Lead to Major Losses
　　Zhuoshui and Other Villages Suffer Great Losses

[Our Newspaper's Report] Just as our liberated army is launching a nationwide victorious counter-offensive, due to insufficient estimation by some local soldiers and civilians of the desperate struggle of the KMT bandits and local bullies entrenched in isolated islands to seize grain, underestimating the enemy and complacency have led to heavy losses. At midnight on October 20th, Liu Mingdao, a traitorous township head of the puppet Bailong Township in Xiuwu, along with the puppet "Self-Defense Corps," rapists, and more than 400 civilians forcibly conscripted, suddenly surrounded the villages of Shandie and Miaoqian. They rushed into the villages, set houses on fire, raped women, and carried away any grain they could find. Agricultural tools, livestock, rags, and broken covers were all swept away. Even the clothes of infants being breastfed were forcibly stripped and stolen. In Shandie village alone, 31 people were captured, including four militiamen. Losses included four rifles, two blunderbusses, five houses burned down, 42 *shi* of grain stolen, 183 bolts of white cloth, 831 *jin* of cotton, 51 head of livestock, and many agricultural tools, clothes, and bundles. On September 30th, more than 100 enemy "Security Team" members from Anyang, with six large carts, surrounded Shangbaishu village before dawn. Even rags and broken shirts were stolen. Chen Tianbao's mother, who was over sixty years old, had her pants taken off and stolen. The enemy even dug out and stole grain that two families had prepared for war but had not yet buried. On October 6th, more than 1,000 bandits from Huixian city, along with fleeing landlords and 1,000 forcibly conscripted civilians, with hundreds of large carts, raided Zhuoshui, Zhuqiao, and surrounding areas to seize grain. Because the masses were complacent beforehand, thinking it was not a big deal, every household in Zhuoshui was ransacked, with boxes and cabinets overturned and the ground dug up three feet deep. Clothes, quilts, and grain were all stolen. Grain losses alone exceeded 500 *shi*. Even the wheat prepared for planting was stolen. Many people are now facing starvation and cold, with no clothes or food. This time, the enemy was particularly vicious, with the daughters and wives of landlords all participating in the looting, taking anything they could get their hands on. On October 13th, thousands of KMT miscellaneous troops from the three counties of Wuzhi, Wenxian, and Huojia, combined with all the township offices and local bullies, divided into four routes to seize grain in the hinterland of Qin South. Due to the complacency of the masses and the underestimation of the enemy by the leadership, the losses were heavy. In six villages, including Da Hongqiao, 60 head of livestock were stolen. In three villages, including Xixiaohong, 145 sheep were stolen. The remaining losses have not yet been fully tallied. In Da Hongqiao village alone, according to incomplete statistics, 459 *jin* of white flour, 858 *jin* of cotton, 156 bolts of cloth, and 31 quilts were stolen.... Having suffered these serious losses and painful lessons, county and district cadres in various counties have become vigilant ideologically. They are strictly checking grain storage and war preparation work, organizing all soldiers and civilians, and launching a revenge movement against the enemy.
