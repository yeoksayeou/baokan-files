　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 11th: According to reports from various sources, the Chiang bandit's local government apparatus in Henan Province has collapsed under the victorious counter-offensive of the People's Liberation Army. From early August to early October, more than 30 Chiang bandit commissioners and county heads in the province were killed or captured by the People's Liberation Army, or were removed from office by the Chiang bandit authorities for "poor defense of the city." Li Qun'e, Chiang bandit commissioner of the Eleventh District, Zhang Honghui, county head of Bo'ai County, Wan Xiangchun, county head of Ningling County, and Miao Weifan, county head of Song County, were all killed or captured by the People's Liberation Army. Yao Anzhi, county head of Lingbao County, Wang Ruichao, county head of Yanshi County, Wang Jieyuan, county head of Minxiang County, Lei Fuxiang, county head of Luoyang County, Tao Jiyuan, county head of Yiyang County, Pang Gonglu, county head of Yiyang County, Xue Zizheng, county head of Xin'an County, Zhan Jian, county head of Luoning County, and Feng Bojing, county head of Guangshan County, were all dismissed from their posts and investigated by the Chiang bandit authorities for "poor defense of the city." Furthermore, the "Eleven Articles on War Defense Preparation" hand-signed by Liu Maoen, chairman of the Chiang bandit Henan Province, captured by the Liberation Army in the Battle of Lushan on the 2nd of this month, contain strict regulations on city defense, road protection, conscription, and gun distribution, and authorize commissioners to inspect various counties in turn. If any county head, deputy commander, township head, village head, or other "supervisory personnel" "fail to supervise effectively" and fail to meet the stipulated requirements, they will be "severely punished" and "shot on the spot," etc., to suppress the panic and desertion of their minions. This shows the panic of the Chiang bandit authorities and the collapse of their government apparatus.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 11th: The powerful activities of the People's Liberation Army on the north bank of the Yangtze River have forced the Yangtze River shipping, an important transportation line for the Chiang bandit's civil war, to come to a standstill. According to a French News Agency report from the 10th, citing the China Yangtze River Shipping Company, shipping between Shanghai and Hankou, as well as all night shipping on the Yangtze River, has been ordered to be temporarily suspended. The reason given is "the unstable situation along the river and the development of military conditions."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 12th: According to reports from the United Press and Reuters, Nanjing, November 11th, Liu Maoen, chairman of the Chiang bandit Henan Provincial Government, Wan Yaohuang, chairman of Hubei Province, Wang Dongyuan, chairman of Hunan Province, Wang Lingji, chairman of Jiangxi Province, and Wang Maogong, chairman of Jiangsu Province, have been summoned to Nanjing by Chiang thief, and Chiang thief is about to convene a "Six-Province Military Conference" to "discuss the rapidly deteriorating situation in the six provinces (referring to the Chiang bandit military crisis)." The United Press stated that Chiang Kai-shek's method of dealing with the powerful offensive of the People's Liberation Army is expected to be only "conscription" and "strengthening the militia (landlord counter-revolutionary armed forces)," which shows the exhaustion of the Chiang bandit's reserves.

　　人民解放军胜利反攻下
  　豫匪地方政权溃乱
    长江航运被迫停顿
    【新华社陕北十一日电】据各方报导：在人民解放军胜利反攻下，蒋匪河南地方政权机构已呈溃乱。从八月初至十月初两个月中，该省蒋匪专员县长为人民解放军毙俘，及因“守城不力”被蒋匪当局撤办者共达三十余人之多。蒋匪十一区专员李群娥，博爱县长张鸿惠，宁陵县长万象春，嵩县县长苗维藩等均为人民解放军击毙或俘获。灵宝县长姚安之，偃师县长王瑞朝，闵乡县长王杰元，洛阳县长雷福祥，宜阳县长陶纪元，伊阳县长庞公路，新安县长薛子正，洛宁县长詹简，光山县长冯伯靖等均因“守城不力”被蒋匪当局撤职查办。又本月二日鲁山战斗中为解放军缴获之蒋匪豫省主席刘茂恩手令“战防准备十一条”，关于守城、护路、抓丁、派枪等均有严厉规定，并授权专员，轮赴各县督查，如有县长，副总队长，乡镇长，寨长及其他“督导人员”等“督办不力”，不能达成规定要求者，即予“严办”及“就地枪决”等，以压制其喽罗的恐慌与逃亡。由此可见蒋匪当局之恐慌及其政权机构的溃乱。
    【新华社陕北十一日电】人民解放军在长江北岸之强大活动，已迫使蒋匪内战重要运输线之长江航运陷于停顿。据法新社十日电引中国长江航运公司方面称：上海与汉口间的航运，以及扬子江上的一切夜间航运皆被命令暂行停止。其理由为“沿江局势不稳与军事情况发展所致”。
    【新华社陕北十二日电】据合众社、路透社十一日南京电讯透露，蒋匪河南省府主席刘茂恩、湖北省主席万耀煌、湖南省主席王东原、江西省主席王陵基及江苏省主席王懋功，已应蒋贼召赴南京，蒋贼即将召开“六省军事会议”，“讨论应付该六省急剧恶化（按指蒋匪军事危机）的情势”。合众社称：蒋介石应付人民解放军强大攻势之办法，预料仅为“征兵”及“加强民团（地主反革命武装）”，此点已显出蒋匪后备之枯竭。
