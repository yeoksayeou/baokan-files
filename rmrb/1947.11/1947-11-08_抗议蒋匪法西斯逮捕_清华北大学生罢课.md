    Protesting Chiang Bandit Fascists' Arrests:
    Tsinghua and Peking University Students Strike
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 6th: According to a United Press Shanghai dispatch of the 4th, citing a Beiping (Peiping) newspaper report, Tsinghua University has begun a three-day strike, and Peking University has decided to strike from the 6th, to protest the Chiang bandit's new fascist arrests of students.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 4th: Comprehensive Tianjin newspaper reports: University and middle school students in Chiang-controlled areas are suffering from hunger, poverty, and misery. The mess hall of Northeast University in Shenyang, due to skyrocketing prices and insufficient food expenses, has been forced to change to serving thin rice porridge three times a day since the 20th of last month. Since the Chiang bandit Ministry of Education canceled the public funding system for students in August, the students of Tangshan Jiaotong University's Engineering Institute have been living in extreme poverty, with many unable to even afford cornbread. Students at Tianjin Municipal Normal School are suffering from poor diet and malnutrition. During the daily "spiritual training" sessions held by the Kuomintang (Chiang Party) training director of the school, many students are unable to stand and faint while listening. Students at Nanjing Central University are suffering from widespread lung disease due to malnutrition, with four dying within a month, three of them from lung disease. Under the Chiang-American rule in the colonized city of Qingdao, prices have skyrocketed. The monthly salary of professors at Shandong University is not enough to buy a single stone of rice, and their families are crying from hunger and cold. They petitioned the Chiang bandit Ministry of Education in mid-October, demanding immediate allocation of supplies to maintain their livelihood. Teachers at Changsha Municipal Central Elementary School, unable to survive on their salaries, went on strike for five days from the 17th of last month, demanding adjustments to their pay, and only resumed teaching on the 22nd after achieving victory.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 4th: United Press Shanghai, 2nd: Hundreds of rickshaw pullers in Shanghai went on strike to protest the owners' increase in rickshaw rental fees. They were interfered with and suppressed by the Chiang bandit authorities, and more than one hundred rickshaw pullers were arrested. The rickshaw pullers are now persisting in their strike and deflating their tires to protest the Chiang bandit authorities' atrocities of arresting people.
