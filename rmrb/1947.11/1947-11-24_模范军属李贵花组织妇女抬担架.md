　　Model Military Family Member Li Guihua Organizes Women to Carry Stretchers
    [JinCheng News from this paper] Li Guihua, a military family member from Liushukou, Sixth District of Jincheng, her husband Chen Suohai joined the army last year. She serves as the secretary of the Women's Rescue Association in the village and is very active in her work. In April, after returning to the village from a meeting in the district, she discussed with the women: What contributions can our women make? Everyone said, "We women can only spin, weave, and work in the fields, what else can we do?" Guihua said, "We young people have big feet, can't we carry stretchers to send wounded soldiers? Now that the militia is on a long march and the civilian laborers are going to war, there are too few laborers in the village, if we don't do it, who will?" At that time, two group leaders volunteered to carry the wounded soldiers, and they made an agreement with the secretary and deputy secretary of the Women's Rescue Association. In the evening, the logistics department said that there was a stretcher that no one would carry, Guihua said: "Our four women will carry it." The logistics department was afraid that they would not be able to carry it and send it, and wanted to send an elderly person to take care of them, but Guihua would not let them go. After a round trip of thirty miles, they carried the stretcher back in half a day. After returning, they were praised by the village cadres. Guihua was in even higher spirits and went to mobilize Wan Ying, Liu Miao, and Fa Miao to carry stretchers individually. She also used their examples to mobilize people at the meeting. At that time, Chang Shuanfeng, the women's squad leader, volunteered to join the stretcher carrying team and guaranteed to organize a stretcher team. Guihua's team has carried stretchers four times. Under her influence, seven women's stretcher teams were organized in the whole village, with a total of twenty-eight women participating. Once, it was raining, Guihua and other three stretcher teams braved the rain to deliver the stretcher, and their clothes got wet when they came back. The elderly people said: "Now women can really stand up to men."
    Now, in Liushukou, Beilijie, Zhanglukou, Beipo, Xiachuan, Nanzhuang, Huangwen and other seven villages in the Sixth District of Jincheng, 51 women's stretchers have been organized one after another, and the organization is currently being expanded. (Le Yu, Guang De)

　　模范军属李贵花组织妇女抬担架
    【本报晋城讯】晋城六区柳树口军属李贵花，她丈夫陈锁孩去年参了军。她在村里担任妇救会秘书，工作很积极。四月间她在区上开会回村后，和妇女们讨论：咱们妇女能立些什么功？都说：“咱妇女只能纺花织布上地劳动，还能做个啥？”贵花说：“咱们青年人又是大脚，咱不能抬担架送伤兵？现在民兵远征啦，民工要参战啦，村里劳力太少，咱不干谁干。”当时就有两个小组长自报要抬伤兵，和妇救正副秘书四个妇女约定好。晚上抗勤说，有一付担架没人去抬，贵花说：“我们四个妇女去抬。”抗勤怕他们抬不动，送不到，要派一个老年人去招呼，贵花不让去。来回三十里路，半晌午就扛着担架回来了。回来后受到村干部表扬，贵花情绪更高，就个别去动员晚英、六苗、发苗抬担架。又在会上以她们的实例作动员，当时就有妇女小队长常拴凤，自报要参加抬伤兵，并保证组织一付担架。贵花这一付，共抬过了四次。在她的影响下，全村组织起七付妇女担架，共二十八个妇女参加。有一次下着雨，贵花等三付担架冒着雨去送担架，回来把衣服也下湿了。老年人说：“现在妇女真能抵住男人”。
    现在晋城六区柳树口、北李街、张炉口、北坡、下川、南庄、黄文等七个村，先后纷纷组织起妇女担架五十一付，现正在扩大组织中。（乐虞、广德）
