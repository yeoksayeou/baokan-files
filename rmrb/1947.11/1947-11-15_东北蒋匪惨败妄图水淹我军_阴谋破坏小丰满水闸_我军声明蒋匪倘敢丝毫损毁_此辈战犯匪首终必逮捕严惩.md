Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, November 11th: The Northeast Chiang Kai-shek bandits are plotting to sabotage the Xiaofengman Power Plant. A spokesman for the Northeast Democratic Allied Army Headquarters issued a statement on this matter, saying: "The Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Jilin are surrounded by our forces and have recently plotted for the third time to sabotage the Xiaofengman Power Plant, flooding the people of the Songhua and Harbin plains. As early as this spring, when our army was south of the Songhua River for the third time and the bandit chiefs Sun Liren and Pan Yukun were besieged in Dehui, the bandit Du Yuming telegraphed the Jilin bandit chief Liang Huasheng to personally arrange the destruction of the Fengman Dam in an attempt to flood our army. At that time, Bandit Liang secretly discussed the matter with the commanding officers of the 545th Regiment of the 182nd Division of the enemy forces stationed there, as well as the chief engineer of the power station, for three days, and then opened the sloping embankment of the dam. At that time, the river surface had not yet thawed, and the released water froze during the night, fortunately preventing a disaster. During our army's summer offensive in May and June, when we directly approached Changchun and Jilin, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits excavated the Dongliao River embankment. At the same time, Bandit Liang Huasheng also came to Fengman for the second time to arrange the release of water, digging tunnels along the mountain side from the main dam to Xiaofengman and storing a large quantity of yellow explosives in preparation for blowing up the dam at any time. All the explosives are still secretly stored in the tunnels. Recently, as our army has besieged Jilin, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits have rekindled their plot to destroy the dam. At the same time, the Chiang Kai-shek Central News Agency and certain foreign news agencies have systematically fabricated various rumors, such as: 'More than 10,000 Communist troops are fiercely attacking Xiaofengman,' 'At 6:00 PM one afternoon, unidentified aircraft were spotted dropping three bombs on Xiaofengman,' 'Calls to rescue the Songhua River Dam near Jilin are rising again,' etc., attempting to preemptively shirk responsibility for the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in order to cover up their actively manufactured heinous crimes."

The spokesman then solemnly declared: "The Xiaofengman Dam is vital to the lives of the vast people in the Songhua River basin and is a major Far Eastern construction project related to the welfare of the people of Northeast China. Our army has the sacred duty to ensure its safety. As early as last year, when our army liberated Jilin, we overcame all difficulties and spared no effort to repair the first embankment of the dam, turning the great project from the brink of collapse to safety. Later, when our army proactively withdrew, it also ensured that the Fengman power source was intact and undamaged. This June, when the Chiang Kai-shek bandits plotted to destroy the dam, Xinhua News Agency was ordered to warn: If the Chiang Kai-shek bandits 'brazenly disregard the interests of the nation and the safety of the people's lives, and cause any damage to this important industrial construction, they will not only bear full responsibility for all serious consequences, but the people of Northeast China will also impose the most severe punishments on these war criminals.' During our army's operations in the outer perimeter of Jilin and Changchun, our forward command also issued a notice to Hu Yan, the commander of the 544th Regiment of the 182nd Division of the 60th Army, the enemy forces guarding Xiaofengman, on the 3rd of this month, warning them that they should 'resolutely refuse to follow chaotic orders, do their best to protect the dam, and stop all sabotage activities by secret agents to implement the plot to release water, otherwise they will be responsible for this crime.' I am now under orders to solemnly warn once again: 'Chiang Kai-shek's flooding of the Yellow River failed to stop our army's offensive on the southern front, and destroying the Songhua River dam will also not save the bandit army's destruction on the northern front. If the Chiang Kai-shek bandits dare to use this world-renowned power source as a cruel sacrifice and cause any damage to it, our army will pursue them to the ends of the earth and order the arrest of the war criminal ringleaders who ordered and directly destroyed the dam, and hand them over to the people's court for severe punishment, with no leniency whatsoever.'"

　　东北蒋匪惨败妄图水淹我军
    阴谋破坏小丰满水闸
    我军声明蒋匪倘敢丝毫损毁
    此辈战犯匪首终必逮捕严惩
    【新华社东北十一日电】东北蒋匪阴谋破坏小丰满发电所，东北民主联军总部发言人顷就此事发表谈话称：“吉林蒋匪被我围困，近又第三次阴谋破坏小丰满发电所，水淹松、哈平原人民。远在今春我军三下松花江南，匪首孙立人、潘裕昆被围德惠时，杜匪聿明即曾电令吉林匪首梁华盛亲临布置毁坏丰满水闸，企图水淹我军。梁匪当时曾与该地守敌一八二师五四五团主官及电站总工程师密商三日，乃将水闸上之斜堤开放。其时江面尚未解冰，所放之水，昼流夜凝，幸未成灾。五六月间我军夏季攻势，直逼长春、吉林之时，蒋匪即掘开东辽河堤，同时梁匪华盛亦二次亲临丰满布置放水，曾在大水闸通往小丰满的沿途山侧，挖掘坑道，储藏大批黄色炸药，以备随时炸毁水闸，现所有炸药仍密藏坑道之中。近以我军围困吉林，蒋匪即又重燃毁闸阴谋。与此同时，蒋匪中央社及某些外国通讯社并有系统制造种种谣言，如所谓：“共军万余猛攻小丰满”，“一日午后六时，小丰满发现番号不明的飞机投弹三枚”，“抢救吉林附近松花江大水闸的呼声又起”等等，企图事先为蒋匪推卸责任，以掩盖其积极制造之滔天罪行。”
    发言人继即严正声明：“小丰满大水闸为松花江流域广大人民生命所系，为东北人民福利攸关的远东巨大建设，我军有确保其安全的神圣职责。早在去年我军解放吉林时，当时即曾在极端困难的物质条件下，排除万难抢修水闸头道堤坝，使濒于崩溃的伟大工程转危为安。后我军主动转移时，亦确保丰满电源完好无损。今年六月蒋匪阴谋毁闸时，新华社即奉命警告：如蒋匪“竟悍然不顾国家民族利益以及人民生命安全，将此一重要工业建设加以任何破坏，彼等不仅将负引起一切严重后果之全部责任，同时我东北人民亦将对此辈战争罪犯，予以最严厉之处罚。”此次我军于吉长外围作战时，我前线前进指挥部，亦曾于本月三日通牒小丰满守敌六十军一八二师五四四团团长胡彦，警告其应“毅然拒绝乱命，尽力保护水闸，制止一切特务分子实行放水的阴谋手段，否则应对此种罪行负责。”本人兹特奉命再一次严重警告：“蒋匪黄河纵水未能阻止南线我军攻势，松江毁闸也决不能挽救北线匪军覆灭。倘使蒋匪竟敢以此举世闻名之电源，作其残酷的殉葬品，对其加以丝毫破坏，则我军纵使追至海角天涯，亦必将下令指使及直接毁闸之战犯罪首，逮交人民法庭严厉惩办，决不宽贷。”
