    [This dispatch from Taiyue on the 31st] Wang Sanguan, a labor hero from Longquan Village in Qinyuan, solved the fertilizer shortage for the masses by initiating a collective purchase of sheep. This village faced a fertilizer shortage during this year's planting season. They had previously bedded 150 sheep overnight, yielding 415 jin of salt, worth 62,250 yuan; 115 packs of dry tobacco, worth 28,750 yuan; and consumed 13.8 shi of grain for meals, worth 138,000 yuan, totaling 229,000 yuan. Labor hero Wang Sanguan and village head Hou Yuming calculated these expenses for the masses and initiated a collective purchase of sheep to solve the fertilizer shortage. They first borrowed 200,000 yuan from the bank and bought 70 sheep on September 25th. Combined with the village's existing 60-plus sheep, they now had over 130 sheep. They immediately built a pen and bedded them down without spending any money. The masses were very happy, saying, "This completely solves the fertilizer shortage!" They all actively invested, raising a total of 222,000 yuan, resolving the funding for buying sheep.

    沁源龙泉买羊积肥
    【本报太岳三十一日电】沁源龙泉村劳动英雄王三官给群众解决肥料困难，发起集体买羊一群。该村在今年下种时肥料缺乏，曾卧了一百五十夜羊，出了四百一十五斤盐，值洋六万二千二百五十元，出旱烟一百一十五包，值洋二万八千七百五十元，管饭食用粮食十三石八斗，折洋十三万八千元，共需洋二十二万九千元。劳动英雄王三官及村长侯玉铭等就把这一笔帐给群众算了一下，发起集体买羊，以解决肥料困难。他们首先向银行贷款二十万元，于九月二十五日买回羊子七十只，连村中原有羊六十余只共一百三十余只，马上编圈，卧地不用花钱，群众十分高兴，说：“这算彻底解决了肥料困难啦！”都纷纷入股，共投资二十二万二千元，解决了买羊基金。
