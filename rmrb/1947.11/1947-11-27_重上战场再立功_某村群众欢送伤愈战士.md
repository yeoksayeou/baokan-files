　　Back to the Battlefield to Achieve New Merits
  　Masses in a Certain Village Cheerfully See Off Wounded and Recovered Soldiers
    [This newspaper's report from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, 25th] The liberated peasants joyfully send off the wounded and recovered soldiers to the front lines. On the 25th of last month, the heroes who were wounded in the annihilation of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit 57th Division, having recovered and returned to the front lines, were specially sent off by the liberated peasants around the directly subordinate hospital, who prepared liberated happy wine. The gongs and drums resounded, shaking the heavens and earth, and the square outside the village was crowded with old and young, men and women. An old woman held a red flag with the words: "Gloriously Return to the Front!" The heroes were all full of spirit, brave and high-spirited, determined to return to the front line and achieve new merits. An old woman filled a cup of wine and said to the soldier Zhou Fuchang: "Comrade, please drink a cup of happy wine. After drinking our liberated happy wine, go and overthrow the Chiang bandits!" After the wounded soldiers finished drinking in turn, the peasants diligently saw them off outside the village, and the sisters' group sang the song "Dear comrades, you are so glorious, recovering and going to the front line, adding merit upon merit" to see them off. At this time, the wounded soldiers also shouted heroic slogans such as "Fight to Nanjing, capture Chiang Kai-shek alive," and "Achieve merits for the people."

  　某村群众欢送伤愈战士
    【本报冀鲁豫二十五日电】翻身农民，欢送伤愈战士上前线。上月二十五日，歼灭蒋匪五十七师负伤的英雄们，伤愈重上前线，直属院周围的翻身农民，特备翻身喜酒，前来送行。锣鼓敲得惊天动地，村外的广场上拥满着老少爷娘们。老大娘手执红旗，上面是：“光荣再上前方”！英雄们则个个精神饱满，雄赳赳，气昂昂，要重上前线再立功。一位老大娘斟满杯酒，向战士周福昌说道：“同志，请喝杯喜酒，喝了俺翻身喜酒，好去打倒蒋贼！”伤员们顺次喝完后，农民们殷勤的送到村外，姊妹团唱着：“亲爱的同志们，你们真光荣，伤愈上前线，功上再加功”的歌声欢送。这时伤员也喊出：“打到南京去，活捉蒋介石。”“为人民立功。”等雄壮的口号。
