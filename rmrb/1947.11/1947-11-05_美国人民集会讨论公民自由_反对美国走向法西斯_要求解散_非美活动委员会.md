Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: New York dispatch: Under the auspices of the "American Progressive Citizens Association," a conference discussing American civil liberties opened on the morning of October 25th at the Commodore Hotel in New York. The conference lasted two days, attended by over two thousand representatives from seventeen states and prominent democrats. Speakers focused on attacking and demanding the dissolution of the "House Un-American Activities Committee," while also issuing a warning signal that the United States is currently facing the danger of fascism. Former Assistant Commander Rogers, along with Progressive Citizens Association Chairman Kimpton and Director Kenny, all strongly condemned the "Un-American Activities Committee" as unconstitutional. Rogers warned that fascism is growing in the United States and has concentrated its fire on launching a fierce attack on democrats. He called on Hollywood movie stars subpoenaed to Washington by the Un-American Activities Committee to resist the committee and refuse to testify. Reporter Bernstein pointed out that the current situation in the United States is similar to Germany before Hitler came to power in 1932. Writer Feist, who was recently persecuted, urged the conference to strive for democracy and freedom of speech. Strive to oppose the Un-American Activities Committee and all fascist movements. Novelist Todd warned that American intellectuals must oppose the fascist tendencies within the United States, otherwise they will suffer the same fate as German intellectuals. Writer Mottley called for vigilance against the American reactionaries' promotion of anti-Soviet war. At a meeting discussing the film and publishing industries, stage designer Mertz said that the purpose of the Un-American Activities Committee is not only to expel followers of Marx from American life, but also to expel anyone who advocates social reform and insult any artistic work that expresses humanitarian and philanthropic views. Speakers at the science conference protested the U.S. authorities' restrictions and inspections of scientists. Columbia Medical School professor Bao Yasi called on medical professionals to fight for the liberation of medicine from the control of reactionaries. The conference also received telegrams from black singer Robeson and others. Wallace, who is currently traveling in Palestine, also sent a telegram to the conference, urging the dissolution of the House Un-American Activities Committee.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th: New York dispatch: The "American Progressive Citizens Association" recently hosted a mass rally of over five thousand people here, protesting the House Un-American Activities Committee's investigation into the so-called "Communist infiltration of Hollywood." Participants at the rally passed a resolution in an impassioned atmosphere demanding that Congress abolish the "Un-American Activities Committee." Another ten thousand people gathered in the corridors outside the venue without admission tickets. Senator Pepper, in a speech to the conference, strongly condemned the "Un-American Activities Committee's" "investigation" of progressive figures in Hollywood, calling it "an attack on the human rights of all American citizens." Pepper called on the American people to mobilize and dispel the "fascist propaganda fog" spread by the committee. At the same time, forty prominent Hollywood actors and actresses also flew to Washington on a special plane on the 25th to protest the "Un-American Activities Committee's" ongoing so-called "investigation of pro-Communist propaganda in the film industry." This long-standing "investigation" conspiracy by American reactionaries officially began on the 20th, involving many people, and is expected to continue for several weeks.
