    Experiences in Overcoming Labor and Livestock Difficulties
    [This newspaper's Taihang dispatch, 3rd] Various places in Taihang have created many methods to overcome the difficulties of labor and livestock power during autumn cultivation, which has increased the speed of autumn cultivation and shortened the time. The basic methods and experiences to overcome the difficulties of labor and livestock power are: First, "squeeze" everywhere to expand the scope of labor and livestock power participating in autumn cultivation. (1) All livestock power is organized to till the land, stopping other work. For example, Wujing Village in Ping Shun proposed: "Overthrow old habits, do not rely on livestock for five things (do not use livestock to carry grain, carry corn, grind flour, thresh, or deliver manure)." Secondly, implement the method of livestock splitting shares, one share topping two shares. In Xiyang, the old idea that donkeys cannot till land for fear of pressing their shoulders has been broken. (2) In addition to organizing all male labor to pull plows and dig the ground, old men, women, and children are also organized to rake stubble and dig the ground. In mobilizing this group of laborers, the new method is to start with the poor and hired, inspiring them to recall the pain of exploitation suffered in the past when cutting grain, threshing, watching children, and doing odd jobs for landlords, and to awaken the class consciousness of "turning over and working for ourselves today." Rely on them as the backbone to connect with the masses. For women, two things must be paid attention to. On the one hand, we must establish the idea that they "have a status and earn wages," so that they will consciously go to the fields. On the other hand, we must break the men's contempt and the family's dragging back. The experience of the Sixth District of Shahe is: in the women's work in the fields, the work is carefully divided, the wages are paid in cash, and the dividends are shared with the family. The allocation of life also takes care of their physical weakness and busy housework. Therefore, the number of women going to the fields is increasing day by day. (3) Adopt the contracting method (in Xiang, Li, and other places), organize teams selling time, shock brigades, and teams selling labor, and implement mutual support for autumn cultivation between villages, districts, and counties. Second, scientifically arrange livelihood and rationally and meticulously divide labor, without wasting any labor or livestock power. (1) Temporarily implement merging groups, or the village production committee unifies the leadership of the village's labor and livestock power, and uniformly allocates according to the tightness of life (such as first cultivating shady and concave land), and tills the land by piece, or adopts the exchange of cultivated land between groups to avoid frequent transfers and waste of labor and livestock power. (2) Carry forward the experience of strict and specific division of labor in the "three搶 and one 齊干" (three seizing and one doing together) campaign, give full play to one's expertise. The general practice is that a small number of men take the lead, and most women and children continue to sweep up the tail of the autumn harvest, old men hold the plow to till the land, and male laborers dig the ground. Many villages in Licheng, with the team or village as a unit, carry out a major adjustment according to the strength of labor and the quality of skills, and temporarily form harvesting groups, carrying groups, plowing groups, cutting grain and threshing groups according to the nature of the work, and harvest, cultivate, and sow by piece, cleaning up households one by one. Third, implement a more reasonable equivalent exchange, and carry out a movement to compete for work points (that is, reward points for doing more work) to improve labor efficiency. In terms of assessing and calculating work, in addition to large-scale labor exchange, two kinds of contracting systems that can improve labor efficiency or are extremely simple to calculate are commonly used in Changzhi, Wuxiang, Pingshun, Licheng, Shahe and other counties: (1) large-scale contracting, uniformly assess the work points of cultivated land according to whether it is easy or difficult to cultivate (what stubble, block size, soil quality), and the distance of the mileage, insert score cards on the ground, then assess the work points of agricultural tools, and then allocate labor and livestock power to the groups and teams to do the work (Shahe and Wuxiang call labor shares), and calculate the work according to the work. If the labor used is less than the contracted work points, the extra points are distributed according to the work points. If the labor used exceeds the contracted number of work points, the loss is shared according to the work. (2) Small-scale contracting, the difference from the above is that the team is the unit and the work is contracted temporarily in the field. In addition, there are two new developments in scoring and calculating work: one is to reward more work and double the work points. For example, Changcun Village in Huguan stipulates: five points for plowing the ground for one work, if seven points and five are plowed, two work are counted. The Meng Zhi group in Nantianhe, Changzhi, will receive an extra 120 yuan for digging the ground more than one work point; The second is that due to the meticulous division of labor, the scope of calculating work has been expanded, and the calculation of work is more meticulous, which encourages auxiliary labor. For example, in Chang, Hu, and other places, old women who cook and watch children, and children who pick up stones, carry farm tools, tie corn, pick up beans, and lead livestock, all implement reasonable scoring. The above-mentioned forms and practices of calculating work have encouraged all men, women, full, half, and auxiliary labor to automatically launch a "fighting for points for the family" movement. The group of Li Tong in Xicui Village, Shahe, originally assessed 200 workers per mu for sowing wheat and 100 workers for livestock. As a result of fighting for points, 130 workers were saved. In Changzhi and other places, some male laborers were counted as 17 work points a day, some female laborers were counted as more than 10 work points, and children were also counted as 6 work points. Fourth, squeeze time and do more work. The most common practice is to start early and work late, and deliver meals at noon. Secondly, in Heshun, Pingshun, and other places, after changing the old habit of cultivating half a day and resting half a day, and not feeding grass to cattle on the mountain, which not only wasted work but also did not feed the livestock enough, the efficiency of livestock cultivation has greatly increased compared to before. In addition, organizing shift cultivation, changing shifts at noon so that livestock do not rest, and using emergency methods such as working overnight can also be promoted as appropriate. In Lucheng and other places, a bonus point system is implemented for squeezing time and doing more work. For example, in Nanmazhuang, the work points for carrying grain are 10 points for carrying five loads of grain during the day, and 10 points for carrying four loads at night, with a reward of one work point.

    太行秋耕中
    克服劳畜困难经验
    【本报太行三日电】太行各地在秋耕中创造了不少克服劳畜力困难的办法，使秋耕速度增高时间缩短。克服劳畜力困难的基本办法和经验是：第一，到处“挤”，扩大参加秋耕的劳畜力范围。（一）畜力全部组织垡地，停止干其它活，如平顺中五井村提出：“打倒旧习惯，要五不靠牲口（不要牲口驮谷、驮玉茭、碾面、打场、送粪）。其次便是实行牲口折犋，一犋顶两犋的办法。在昔阳，更打破了驴不能垡地怕压膀旧思想。（二）除组织全部男劳力人拉犁，人掘地，还组织老汉妇女儿童刨茬、掘地。在发动这批劳力中，新作法是先从贫雇入手，启发他们回忆过去给地主切谷、打场、看孩、打杂等受的剥削痛苦，唤起“今天为自己劳动翻透身”的阶级自觉，依他们作骨干去大批串通。对于妇女必须注意两件事，一方面要树立其“有地位，又赚工资”名利两得的思想，使其自觉下地；另一方面要打破男人的轻视和家庭拉后腿。沙河六区的经验是：在妇女下地中认真按活计了分，工资兑了现，并与家分了红，分配生活中又照顾了她们身体弱与家务忙。因此，下地的妇女一天比一天多。（三）采用（襄、黎等地）包工方法，组织卖晌队、突击队、卖工队，实行村与村、区与区、县与县的相互支援秋耕。第二，科学按排营生和合理细密分工，不浪费一分劳畜力。（一）临时实行并组，或由村生产委员会统一领导全村劳畜力，根据生活松紧（如先耕背阴、凹地），统一分配，按片挨住垡地，或者采用组与组交换耕地，以免调动频繁浪费劳畜力。（二）发扬三抢一齐干中严格、具体的分工经验，发挥一技之长，一般的作法是少部男人带头，大部妇女儿童继续扫秋收尾巴，老汉掌犁垡地，男劳力掘地。黎城不少村庄以队或村为单位，按劳力强弱，技能好坏实行大调整，分别按做活性质临时组成收割组，担运组，犁地组，切谷打场组，按片收、耕、种，挨家清理。第三，实行更合理的等价交换，开展名利双得的争工分运动（即多做活奖励分）以提高劳动效率。在按活评、计工的形式上，除大变工外，在长治、武乡、平顺、黎城、沙河等县，普遍采用更能提高劳动效率、或算帐极为简便的两种包工制：（一）大包工，统一把耕地按好耕难耕（什么茬，块大小，土质），里程远近评出工分，地头插分数牌，再把农具评作工分，然后按组、队分配劳畜力去作活（沙河、武乡叫劳力入股），按活计工。如用工比包工分少，多赚的分数按工分红，用工超过包工数、赔了按工摊。（二）小包工，和上述不同的是以小组为单位，临时到地里评分包工。另外，在评分计工上，有两点新发展：一是奖励多做活，加倍计工。如壶关畅村规定：一工刨地五分，如刨地七分五即计两工，长治南天河孟智组，掘地超过一分工另奖洋一百二十元；二是由于细密的分工，扩大了计工范围，计工更细致，这样鼓励了辅助劳力。如长、壶等地，老太婆做饭、看孩，儿童拾石头、扛农具、捆玉茭、拾豆子、牵牲口等，都实行合理的计分。上述的计工形式和作法，鼓励了男女全半辅助劳力，自动掀起“为家争分”运动。沙河西崔村李同的组，原按亩评种麦人工共二百个，畜工一百个，争分结果省下一百三十个工，长治等地男劳力有的一天计到十七分工，女劳力有的计到十余分工，儿童也计到六分工。第四，挤时间，多做活。最普遍的作法是起早搭黑，搭晌送饭。其次，在和顺、平顺等地，均改变了过去耕半日歇半日，不喂草料上山放牛，既误工、牲口又吃不饱的旧习惯后，牲口耕地效率比前大大增加。另外组织变班耕地，晌午人换班，牲口不歇，以及连夜做活等突击办法，也可酌情发扬。在潞城等地，对挤时多做活，并实行奖分办法，如南马庄担谷计工是白天五担谷计十分，夜担四担计十分，奖励一分工。
