　　Yong Sheng Chemical Industry Cooperative Reduces Costs and Increases Production
　　[This Dispatch] Under the slogan of "Building a New Factory," all employees of the Yong Sheng Chemical Industry Cooperative have been working intensely to reduce costs, without rest for three months. Recently, new apprentices have arrived successively, and the hand-made alkali industry has begun. During discussions on "reducing costs" and this year's production plan, they unanimously proposed self-supplied work clothes (saving 2.1 million yuan annually) and foregoing the monthly supply of paper, pens, and other tools, saving a minimum of 3 million yuan annually for the 80 employees. When discussing taking on apprentices, they consciously proposed: "not being arrogant," "unity between new and old apprentices," "saying what you know," "teaching what you can," and "strictly implementing the recording of work and materials for cost calculation," etc. All comrades in the factory have a closer relationship with the factory and recognize that cost reduction and quality improvement are the decisive factors for the factory's existence and development, as well as the foundation for everyone's future and a concrete way to support the front lines.

　　永生化学工业社减低成本提高生产
    【本报讯】永生化学工业社，在“建设新厂”的口号下，全体职工为减低成本紧张工作，三个月来没有休息。最近新学徒陆续到来，手工制碱业已开始，在讨论“减低成本”和本年生产计划时，一致提出工衣自备（全年二百一十万），不领每月供给之纸笔等工具，职工八十人，全年最低节省三百万元。在讨论带徒弟时，自觉提出：“不自高自大”“新旧学徒团结”、“有一点说一点”，“会啥教啥”，“严格执行记工记料以便成本计算”等。全厂同志们对工厂的关系更加密切，认识到成本减低与质量的提高，是工厂存在与发展的决定因素，也是每个人前途依靠，是支援前线的具体工作。（徐晶）
