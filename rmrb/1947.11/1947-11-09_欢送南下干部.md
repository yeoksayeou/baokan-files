　　【This newspaper's report from the Jilu Yu Region, 6th】 On the morning of October 25th, the news of "seeing off southern-bound cadres" spread throughout the Dong'e County government offices. Two large cloth banners reading "Wishing the southern-bound cadres a smooth arrival at the Yangtze River" and "Southern-bound cadres are national heroes and pillars of the people" had already been strung up at both ends of the street. When the Arts Association's loudspeaker sounded, children, young women, elderly women in their seventies and eighties, and comrades from the government offices had already gathered on the street. Each southern-bound comrade was busy finding their acquaintances to say goodbye; "Are you going south?" "Going south!" "I'll follow soon, see you in the Dabie Mountains!" After the meal, County Secretary Zou and Minister Ge asked very concernedly if anyone was missing anything? Whether the things that needed to be done had been done? …. The mules of the third team were very temperamental and would not allow the quilts to be placed on top, and the comrades were complaining about the delay because of this. Comrade Sanyuan came over and said, "It doesn't matter, we'll exchange them for good ones when we cross the river (get them from Jiang's army)!" A liberated peasant, ××, from He Village, First District, with a family of five and ten acres of land, volunteered to go south in the district and carried his bundled quilt on his back. When others asked him what to do when he got there, he answered simply: "Learn from the experience here, and we will definitely help the poor there to turn over!" When he heard the Yangko team on the street start to dance amidst the din of gongs and drums, this thirty-year-old peasant walked onto the street, swaying like a child, displaying unparalleled joy. Liberated peasants understand the pain of those who have not been liberated the most, just as the red banner wrote: "Go south! Liberate our suffering compatriots in Jiangbei!" When they departed, the gongs and drums immediately sounded, the Arts Association's loudspeaker squealed, the masses on both sides of the street pushed and shoved, and the Yangko team danced vigorously at the front, shouting the slogan "Wishing the southern-bound cadres a smooth arrival on the north bank of the Yangtze River!" From the ranks of the forty-odd southern-bound cadres, a resounding oath was heard: "Resolutely lead the suffering compatriots in Jiangbei to turn over and complete the land reform!" The crowds who came to see them off watched the departing ranks in the distance. Grandma Laogen, who was seventy years old, was still clamoring when she returned: "This is so glorious! So good! The people there haven't turned over yet, we're going to lead them to rise up, so that we can defeat those bad people as soon as possible and live a peaceful life."

    欢送南下干部
    【本报冀鲁豫六日电】十月廿五日早晨，“欢送南下干部”的消息，传遍东阿县的各机关。“祝南下干部顺利到达长江”、“南下干部是民族勇士、人民的支柱”两条用布制成的大标语，早已拉在了街的两头。当艺联的喇叭响起来的时候，小孩、闺女、七八十的老大娘和机关同志，都已拥在街上，各个南下的同志都在忙着找自己的熟人话别；“你南下？”“南下！”“我随后就跟上，大别山见面呀！”饭后，奏县书、葛部长很关切的问谁还缺啥东西？该办的事是否办好了？……。三班的骡子性子很怪，被子不叫向上放，同志们在为此耽误而嚷嚷着。三元同志过来便说：“不要啦，过河换好的（得蒋军的）！”。一区贺庄翻身农民××，家有五口人，分了十亩地，在区里自报南下后，便背着捆好了的被子，当别人问他去了怎样办？他干脆的回答：“学习咱这里的经验，一定叫那里的穷人翻身！”当他听到街上秧歌队在锣鼓喧天中扭起来的时候，这位三十岁的农民象小孩子一样一扭一扭的走上街上去，表现了无比的愉快。翻身农民最了解没翻身人民的痛苦，正如那条红标语所写的：“南下！解救江北受难的同胞！”出发了，立时锣鼓齐鸣，艺联的喇叭在吱吱乱叫，街两旁的群众在前拥后挤，秧歌队在头里用劲的扭着，喊起了“欢送南下干部顺利到达长江北岸”的口号。四十余个南下干部的行列里，发出“坚决领导江北受苦同胞翻身，完成土地改革！”响亮的誓言。送行的群众，遥望着走远的行列，老根的奶奶七十了，当她回来时，嘴里还在嚷嚷着：“这多光荣呀！多好呀！人家那里的人还没翻身哩，咱去领导人家起来，好早天打败那些坏人，过安生日子。”
