    The art workers of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Literary Association have recently produced a new animated film, "Land Returned to the Home," after several months of effort. It was first performed in the villages near the station at the beginning of this month, with folk artist Wang Guicheng performing a storytelling performance, which was widely welcomed by the audience. They are now continuing to perform in nearby villages, preparing to solicit opinions from the audience, especially the opinions of the liberated peasants, to make further revisions, and then to perform in various places. In the future, they also plan to use this form that is loved by the masses to go deep into the masses, so that art workers and liberated peasants can establish close links, so as to strengthen the artistic propaganda activities in rural areas, and to enrich and transform the work of the art workers themselves.

    边区文联出演新洋片
    晋冀鲁豫边区文联美术工作者经数月之努力，于最近制成“土地还家”新洋片一套，本月初首次于驻地附近乡村巡回演出，由民间艺人王桂成说书表演，获得观众的普遍欢迎。他们现正继续在附近各村演出，准备普遍征求观众意见，尤其翻身农民的意见，再加以修改，然后再到各地演出。今后并准备利用此一群众所喜爱的形式，深入群众，使美术工作者和翻身农民取得密切连系，以加强农村的艺术宣传活动，并使美术工作者本身的工作获得充实与改造。
