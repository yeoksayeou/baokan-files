Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 16th. Frontline reporter's dispatch: Quick sketch of the breakthrough at Waishi Gou in the western suburbs of Shijiazhuang—On the 8th, a unit of the People's Liberation Army, using the barracks in the western suburbs of Shijiazhuang as a launching point, launched an offensive against the bandit-puppet Waishi Gou. Our regiment's command post was located in a two-story building a few hundred meters from the first line of defense. The artillery command post was also here. The observation post on the roof was our artillery observation point. From here, we could clearly see all the enemy's activities in Shi Gou. At 4:30 pm, our army's general offensive began. The sound of cannons and machine guns resounded through the sky, and shells fell on the enemy's positions. The southwest wind turned the smoke from the shells into a belt of mist, completely shrouding the front. Zhang, the head of our artillery regiment, stood at the observation post amidst the deafening sound of firing, using the telephone to order the gunners to aim at the target. The machine guns roared as well, preventing the enemy from raising their heads. The enemy's blockade ditch, which was more than two zhang wide and deep, was leveled by our artillery fire. The soldiers surged forward and captured the enemy's forward positions in one minute. In the southern section, our unit used ladders to cross the precipitous cliffs of the large ditch in ten minutes, opening up two breakthrough points. The enemy, like a scattered flock of sheep, threw their weapons all over the ground, following our infantry's rapid advance. Half an hour later, our bugle call of charge came from half a kilometer inside Shi Gou. That night, the People's Liberation Army occupied Xijiao Village, Chengjiaozhuang Agricultural Experiment Farm, and the hospital, which were the first line of defense on the west side of Shizhuang, completely eliminating the enemy between the two Shi Gou.

　　石庄西郊外市沟战斗速写
    【新华社晋察冀十六日电】前线记者报导：突破石家庄西郊外市沟速写——八日，解放军一部以石家庄西郊兵营为出击阵地，向匪伪外市沟发动攻势，我某团指挥所设在离第一道防线数百公尺的一栋两层楼房内，炮兵指挥所也在这里，房顶上的了望台是我们炮兵观察点，从这里可以看清市沟内敌人的一切活动。下午四点三十分，我军总攻开始了，炮声与机枪声响彻云霄，炮弹纷纷落在敌人阵地上，西南风把弹烟连成一条雾带，完全笼罩了前沿。我炮兵团张团长，在震耳欲聋的发射声中站在观察点用电话命令射击手对准目标射击，机关枪也怒吼着，打得敌人抬不起头来。敌人深宽约两丈多的封锁沟被我炮火轰平，战士们汹涌而上，一分钟占领了敌前沿阵地。南段我某部在十分钟内用梯子通过了悬岩峭壁似的大沟，打开了两个突破口。敌人象被驱散的羊群，把武器扔了遍地，跟着我步兵神速的向前进攻。半小时后，市沟内一里地外传来了我们的冲锋号。是夜，解放军就占领了西面石庄第一道防线的西焦村、城角庄农业实验厂和医院，完全肃清了两道市沟间的敌人。
