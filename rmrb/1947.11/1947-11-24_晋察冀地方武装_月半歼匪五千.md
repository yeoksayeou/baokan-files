　　Local Armed Forces of Jin-Cha-Ji Liberated Area
    Annihilate 5,000 Bandits in Half a Month
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 22nd] From the beginning of October to the 15th of this month, local troops and militia in various parts of the Jin-Cha-Ji area launched extensive attacks on the Chiang-Fu bandit troops in coordination with the main forces. According to incomplete statistics, a total of more than 5,000 enemies were annihilated. Among them, on October 10, the local armed forces and militia on both sides of the Daqing River cooperated with the main force to block the 15 regiments of Chiang bandits who went south to reinforce Qingfengdian, annihilating more than 1,000 Chiang bandits. They successively captured four county towns including Xiongxian, Xinzhen, Rongcheng, and Baxian (the city was re-occupied by the Chiang bandits on October 29), and dozens of important strongholds of bandits and puppets such as Donghewa in northeastern Jin and Songlindian on the Ping-Han Railway. They twice raided Lixian and Pingdi, two important towns south of Pingjin, and once attacked the Jiang bandit stronghold of Wujiazui, more than ten miles north of Tianjin, causing great panic among the Chiang bandits in Tianjin. All eighty miles of the blockade line painstakingly constructed by Wang Ni Fenggang between Guan City and Shuantoupou, Shuantoupou and Sanhedian, and Gu'an and Xinzhen were completely destroyed. The 38-mile section of the Ping-Han Railway between Zhuoxian and Gaobeidian and the Ping-Han branch line from Liulihe to Zhoukoudian, which the Chiang bandits had just completed, were also destroyed. The railway transportation between Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in Pingjin was cut off and has not been restored to this day. In southern Chahar, a part of the Yan bandit's 16th Security Regiment, which had invaded Dongjingji, Yangyuan, to loot grain, was repelled.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 22nd] A certain unit of our army in southern Chahar, following the complete annihilation of an entire company of the Yan bandit security regiment in western Yangyuan on the 30th of last month, again on the 4th of this month near Xixinzhuang, fifteen miles west of Yangyuan, annihilated most of the two squadrons of the Fu bandit's Ninth Security Brigade, which had invaded to loot grain, killing and capturing more than 120 bandits and seizing more than 80 rifles.

    月半歼匪五千
    【新华社晋察冀廿二日电】十月初至本月十五日，晋察冀各地地方部队及民兵为配合主力作战，向蒋傅匪军广泛出击。据不完全统计，共歼敌五千余人，其中十月十日大清河两岸地武民兵协同主力阻击南下增援清风店之蒋匪十五个团兵力，即歼蒋匪千余人。先后攻克雄县、新镇、容城、霸县（该城于十月二十九日复为蒋匪侵占）等县城四座，及晋东北东河洼、平汉线上之松林店等匪伪重要据点数十处。二次袭入平南之礼贤、平地两重镇，并一度攻入距天津北十余里之吴家嘴蒋匪据点，天津蒋匪大为恐慌。全部摧毁固安城至双头铺、双头铺至三河店及固安与新镇间王逆凤岗苦心构筑之八十里封锁线，全都破除。涿县高碑店间，长达三十八华里之平汉铁路及蒋匪甫告修竣之琉璃河至周口店之平汉支线。使平保间蒋匪之铁路交通断绝，至今未能恢复。察南击退自阳原东井集出犯抢粮之阎匪保安十六团一部。
    【新华社晋察冀二十二日电】察南我军某部继上月三十日于阳原西全歼阎匪保安团一个整连后，复于本月四日于阳原西十五里之西辛庄附近，将出犯抢粮之傅匪保安九大队两个中队大部歼灭，毙俘匪一百二十余人，缴获步枪八十余支。
