　　Sunjiazhuang Cooperative
    Actively Helps the Masses in Production
    [Our Newspaper Gao Yi News] The Sunjiazhuang Cooperative in Gaoyi County has established close ties with the masses in various production activities this year, becoming a reliance for the emancipated masses to solve their difficulties, and playing a considerable supporting role in both agriculture and sideline occupations. (1) In agriculture: At the beginning of the Great Production Movement this spring, although the general basic masses had been emancipated and had houses and land, most of them did not have enough food to eat. The cooperative director, Jiao Zhensheng, worked hard to solve the problem of food shortage. During production, the masses did not have enough livestock to use, so the cooperative immediately lent 400,000 yuan to the masses to buy eleven head of livestock (two mules and nine donkeys). After solving the livestock problem, the masses reported difficulties with farm tools. The cooperative then spent 75,000 yuan to buy ten pieces of tillage equipment and 100 sickles, all of which were sold to the masses at cost price. After the wheat harvest, it also prepared four dou of red beans, four dou of buckwheat, four dou of rapeseed, and four dou of corn to solve the problem of seeds for the masses. (2) In textiles: When spinning and weaving were launched in the village this spring, there were 112 women spinners in the whole village, but only 55 spinning wheels and only five looms. The cooperative immediately made 80 spinning wheels and prepared 500 jin of cotton wadding, allowing the women spinners to exchange yarn for it. In order to improve the skills of the women spinners, the exchange method was determined as follows: first-class yarn exchanged for two jin of cotton wadding, and second-class yarn exchanged for one jin and fifteen taels. If they didn't want wadding and wanted money, they would be given money according to the market price. At the same time, it also lent 60 jin of cotton wadding to the 35 poorest peasant households, stipulating that they should pay it back after earning enough. From spring to autumn, a total of 1,925 jin of wadding were exchanged, which, calculated at 600 yuan per jin, could earn a profit of 1,155,000 yuan. Recently, in order to carry out the 100-day spinning and weaving campaign, Director Jiao personally helped organize seven weaving groups, with a total of 47 people, and 21 small cooperative cotton spinning groups, with 132 people, all of whom have been mobilized. Because there were not enough spinning and weaving tools, the cooperative again made 40 spinning wheels and ten looms (including hand-pulled shuttles), all of which were sold to the women spinners below the market price, and prepared 3,700 jin of cotton wadding. (3) In terms of credit lending: A credit department was also established in early May this year. The cooperative withdrew 600,000 yuan of capital as credit loan funds, and the bank provided 400,000 yuan as support funds. In just five months, more than 7 million yuan was circulated. A total of 118 agricultural, industrial, and commercial loan households were granted loans totaling more than 7,590,000 yuan. Loan households accounted for more than 50% of the total number of households, which played a great role in supporting production. (Qiao Lin, Yong De, You Geng, Wen Yan)

　　孙家庄合作社
    积极帮助群众生产
    【本报高邑讯】高邑孙家庄合作社，在今年各种生产中，与群众发生了密切的联系，成了翻身群众解决困难的依托，不论在农业上、副业上，都起了相当的扶植作用。（一）农业上：在今春大生产运动开始，一般基本群众虽然翻了身，有了房屋、土地，但大部没粮吃，社长焦振声，努力解决粮食困难。生产中群众牲口不够使，合作社当即以四十万元借给群众买牲口十一头（骡二驴九）。解决牲口困难后，群众又反映农具困难，该社又以七万五千元买耕地用具十件，镰刀一百张，均以原价卖给群众。麦收后又准备红豆四斗、荞麦四斗、菜籽四斗、玉茭四斗，以备解决群众种子问题。（二）对纺织上：在春天该村开展纺织时，全村纺妇一一二人，而纺车仅五十五个，机子只五个。该社即制纺车八十个，又准备花穰五百斤，让纺妇以线兑换。为了提高纺妇技术，确定换法是：一等线换二斤花穰、二等线换一斤十五两。不要穰要钱时按市价给钱。同时还借给最困难的三十五户贫农花穰六十斤，规定赚够再还。自春季到秋季共换穰子一九二五斤，每斤按六百元计，能赚利一一五五○○○元。近来为开展百日纺织运动，焦社长亲自帮助组织纺织组织布组七组，共四十七人，组织小型合作纺花组二十一组，一百卅二人，都已动起来。因纺织工具不够使用，该社又给造纺车四十个、布机十张（其中有手拉梭），均低于市价卖给纺妇，又准备花穰三千七百斤。（三）在信用借贷上：今年五月上旬又建立了信用部，由本社抽出资本六十万元，作为信用贷款资金，银行以四十万元作为扶植金。在短短五个月内，周转七百余万元。共计农、工、商贷户一百一十八户，共贷七百五十九万余元。贷户占总户数百分之五十以上，对扶植生产起了很大作用。（乔林、永德、友庚、文彦）
