Left-Wing Party Leaders Hold Meeting
Discuss Further Actions
Against the De Gasperi Government

Italian working people are preparing for further action in the anti-fascist movement. At a meeting of left-wing party leaders in Rome on the 15th, Italian Communist Party leader Togliatti discussed further united action to oppose the De Gasperi government, the enemy of Italian democracy. The Administrative Office of the Rome Labor Council held an emergency meeting on the 15th, attended by representatives of the capital's trade union committees and factories. The meeting passed a resolution demanding the dissolution of the "National Social Movement" and other fascist groups, an immediate halt to the slanderous and defamatory anti-people movement, and a stop to the blatant revenge and civil war propaganda manufactured by reactionaries and so-called "independent newspapers." The resolution stated: "In view of the fact that the government has not expressed a desire to take steps to normalize the situation, the working people will be forced to take all measures at their disposal to protect the future of their country and democracy." Representatives of the printing industry unions said that printing workers refused to print the royalist fascist newspaper "Mondo Alle," (which was to be published in Rome after the Milan incident), and therefore the newspaper would no longer appear. The Secretary of the Italian National Agricultural Workers' Union wrote to De Gasperi stating: "Unless the government takes action against fascist provocations, Italian agricultural workers will not be able to stand idly by."

　　左翼政党领袖举行会议
  　讨论进一步的行动
  　反对加斯贝利政府
    意劳动人民对反法西斯运动准备作进一步的行动。意共领袖托格里亚蒂十五日在罗马的左翼政党领袖会议上，讨论进一步的一致行动，以反对意民主敌人的加斯贝利政府。罗马劳工会行政处十五日举行紧急会议，有首都各工会委员会及各工厂代表参加，该会通过决议，要求解散“国家社会运动”及其它法西斯团体，并立即停止造谣与中伤的反人民运动，及制止明目张胆的反动派和所谓“独立报纸”制造的报复与内战的宣传。该决议称：“鉴于政府并未表示有采取使局势正常化的步骤的愿望，劳动人民将被迫采取在他们支配下的一切办法来保护他们国家及民主的未来”。印刷业工会代表说：印刷工人拒绝印保皇派法西斯报纸“蒙德、阿累”报（该报系在米兰事件后准备在罗马发行的），因此该报将不再出现。意全国农业工人工会书记致函加斯贝利称：“除非政府采取反对法西斯分子挑衅的行动，意农业工人将不能袖手旁观”。
