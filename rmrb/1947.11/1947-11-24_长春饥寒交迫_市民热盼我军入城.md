　　Changchun Suffers from Hunger and Cold
  　Citizens Eagerly Await Our Army to Enter the City
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 22nd] Changchun News: Changchun is facing a grave crisis, and the citizens are eagerly hoping that the Northeast Democratic Allied Army will liberate them soon. Due to the military defeat of the Chiang bandits in the autumn, the railway transportation between Changchun and other cities has long been cut off. Currently, prices in the city are rising several times a day. On the 13th, the price of sorghum skyrocketed to 450 yuan per pound in Chiang bandit currency (each yuan equivalent to 10 yuan of Chiang currency in the mainland), firewood was 150 yuan per pound, coal was 200,000 yuan per ton, and cotton was 2,000 yuan per pound. The poor people and the lower-level staff in Chiang bandit organizations are unable to make a living. After the snowfall, the weather is severely cold, and corpses of those who have frozen to death, starved to death, and committed suicide have been found on the streets. The order in the city is chaotic, with robbery cases occurring every day. Electricity has been cut off for two months, and the city is plunged into darkness at night. Gunshots are heard everywhere, and the Chiang bandit military and political organs are extremely panicked, declaring a curfew from 9 pm every night, plunging the entire city into terror. The Chiang bandits have already airlifted the so-called "Youth Middle School" composed of demobilized youths to the mainland. Chiang special agents in various schools have intensified their activities, and more than a dozen students have been arrested at Changchun University. The citizens secretly say: "The Eighth Route Army is coming soon; things will be better when they come."

　　长春饥寒交迫
  　市民热盼我军入城
    【新华社东北二十二日电】长春消息：面临深重危机的长春，市民咸盼东北民主联军早日解放他们。由于蒋匪秋季军事惨败，长市对外之铁路交通早告断绝。现市内物价一日数涨，十三日高梁米每斤剧涨至蒋匪流通卷（每元合关内蒋币十元）四百五十元，木柴每斤一百五十元，煤每吨二十万元，棉花每斤二千元。贫民及蒋匪机关中下级职员均无法维生。飞雪以后天气严寒，街头已发现冻饿而死与自杀者的尸首。市内秩序混乱，每日均有抢案发生，电灯已断绝两月，入晚一片黑暗，枪声四起，蒋匪军政机关恐慌异常，每晚九时起宣布戒严，全市陷入恐怖。蒋匪已将其所谓由复员青年组成的“青年中学”空运关内。各校蒋特加紧活动，长春大学已有学生十余人被捕。市民们暗暗地说：“八路军快来了，他们来了日子就好过了”。
