　　[Bo'ai News from this newspaper] After all the familiar wasteland in the county has been planted, the focus is on how to eliminate the uncultivated wasteland. The original wasteland totaled over 50,000 mu, with uncultivated wasteland accounting for three-fifths. Near Jianggou in the Third District alone, there are 13,000 mu, and the remaining 17,000+ mu are in the Sanyi Township, Zhuanjing, Zhuguan, and Liucun areas of the First and Fourth Districts. In order to complete this great task, it has been decided that the county will uniformly organize and lead, focusing on eliminating at least 10,000 mu of uncultivated wasteland, striving to complete this in three days. The county has decided to mobilize 23,000 full laborers from the entire county to participate, converting the county's three shock brigades into investigative groups to observe the uncultivated wasteland, and cooperating with the First, Third, and Fourth Districts (other districts have less uncultivated wasteland) for investigation. October 30th is the investigation period, and the entire county will concentrate on a three-day blitz starting November 5th. 1,000 shi (market dou) of wheat seeds are needed. In addition to requesting the special commissioner's office to solve part of the problem, it will be divided among the districts. The daily food problem for each person will initially be solved by bringing three days' worth of provisions themselves. If the poor have no way to do this, the village peasant association will temporarily lend seeds. The county government will issue work tickets. For unallocated wasteland, in the next year's harvest, after deducting seeds and food, the profits can be divided 30/70, with the laborers getting 70% and the landowners getting 30%. Each district is now actively organizing this work, preparing for a major annihilation battle. (Cheng Zhu, Zhi Quan)
　　[Wen County News from this newspaper] The Quan Song United Defense area has already eliminated more than 500 mu of wasteland, and there are still more than 1,000 mu of wasteland remaining. At the United Defense village cadre meeting, the village cadres unanimously resolved to strive to plant all of it with wheat, but the wasteland is all in Dongkou Village. Dongkou alone still has 400 mu of familiar wasteland. The village has 18 draught animals and 320 men and women laborers of all abilities, making it impossible to eliminate all of it. It was immediately decided that village would help village, helping each other, and the United Defense organization would form a wasteland elimination brigade, unified in leadership and specifically divided in labor. The number of mu of wasteland allocated to each village was specifically determined by the number of draught animals, and each village reported its number of draught animals. For example, Da Wu has 43 head of livestock and automatically helps Dongkou eliminate 80 mu of wasteland. Each team of animals is decided to plough three mu of land, and it must be planted well. The compensation is eight sheng of barley for every three mu of land to feed the livestock, and two and a half jin of white flour for the people to eat. Each village should send a cadre to be responsible for leadership, and the landowners are responsible for pulling out the tall grass. Dongkou is also making the following preparations: first, investigate household by household to determine which class the wasteland belongs to, the reason for the wasteland, whether food and drink are provided, and whether there are seeds. If they really can't provide them, the cadres are responsible for coordinating or borrowing from the fruits of struggle. Actively preparing to start. (Si Lin)
