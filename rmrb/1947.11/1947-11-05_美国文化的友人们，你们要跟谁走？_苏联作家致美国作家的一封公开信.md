American Cultural Figures, Which Side Will You Take?
—An Open Letter from Soviet Writers to American Writers

American writers! Cultural workers!

We are sending you this open letter because we are concerned about the fate of culture and the fate of humanity. We do not want to hide our worried feelings from you, nor do we want to close our eyes to the new dangers threatening the fate of culture. These new dangers have emerged one after another, just after we finished fighting humanity’s irreconcilable enemy—fascism.

We feel this danger more acutely than anyone else. Our country suffered unbelievable pain and disaster and suffered enormous losses in the struggle against fascism and in defense of culture. Therefore, we cannot and have no right not to point out this new threat.

We are willing to speak openly, frankly, and without reservation, as honest partners who fought side by side in human society just two years ago, as representatives of two great nations who not long ago shed blood together in the fight against a common enemy.

From the perspective of the future fate of culture, many things done by your country's leading social groups, which go far beyond their own country and affect the entire world, cannot but cause us deep anxiety.

We ask you to think deeply about the fact that even after the end of the anti-fascist war, there are still many such people in your country. Under various guises, they are actually propagating and increasingly implementing in their practical actions the most inhumane ideas. These ideas are the same ones propagated and implemented by the German fascists, who have already been crushed by us.

Fascist ideology is the worship of violence, racial discrimination, the theory of the "superior" race ruling the world; it is the artificial cultivation of a psychology that despises other nations and their history, culture, and national construction; it is the denial of the sovereignty of other countries and unreasonable interference in the internal affairs of other countries. Recently, protectors and propagators of this ideology have continuously emerged among some prominent political activists, diplomats, military personnel, industrialists, magazine reporters, and even scientists in your country.

Isn't this attitude of not allowing other countries to implement ideals and systems different from those of the United States the same as fascist ideology? Aren't the new war cries that your country has directed against our country—cries that perhaps seem commonplace and unremarkable to some of you—the same as fascism? Isn't the use of intimidation and sometimes violent means against other countries to seize world hegemony, realize the so-called "American Century," and establish a "new world order" simply a repeat performance of fascist brigandage? Isn't the daily clamoring by many activists in your country that the American social order should be transplanted all over the world, believing that only the American social order is most suitable for mankind, a reproduction of fascist theory and practice? Isn't the clamor to quickly use atomic bombs to eliminate countries with systems different from the American system the same as fascist ideology?

We firmly believe that the vast majority of American democrats will not and do not want to be responsible for everything that the American successors of those old fascist ideologies are clamoring about in their name. If we did not have this belief, then writing this letter would be meaningless.

We know that our people have been and will always be enemies of all forms of fascism. We believe that outstanding cultural workers who have always stood with the people have been and will always be enemies of fascist theories and practices.

But we are writing this letter to you because we are deeply surprised by the silence maintained by many of you. The spokespersons and cronies of fascism have recently been clamoring wildly in your country, but the representatives of true American culture, the enemies of fascism, rarely speak out.

Writers and cultural workers are the conscience of mankind. If the war—which ended more than two years ago—were still continuing, could they remain silent?

It has been more than two years since the signing of treaties that stipulate that the various nations of the world should no longer engage in bloody struggles, but in these two years, apart from the people who unfortunately live in Greece, Indonesia, and China, many innocent children, women, sons, and ordinary people have been bleeding every day in all corners of the world. Obviously, those who now represent fascist ideology in your country should bear the main responsibility for the people who have already died or are on the verge of death in various parts of the world. After crushing Hitler's Germany, are the new victims who are being added daily to the millions of victims of German fascism the memorial that our compatriots, who gloriously sacrificed themselves in the anti-Hitler struggle, deserve?

The dead cannot be resurrected; they can be insulted, their merits can be diminished, and the significance of their sacrifices can be erased. But we can save the living, and every cultural worker's call to defend world peace and national friendship is a memorial to the dead and for the lives of the living. If, after the end of the anti-fascist war, we still see—not in dreams but in broad daylight—fascist thugs in power, carefully protected by American financial power, beheading and displaying the heads of Greek youths in Sparta, it is impossible to remain silent. When we can still hear the sound of cannons, when Dutch troops, with the help of U.S. dollars, burn down the homes of six million residents, when Chinese patriots are massacred, when Spanish republicans are executed, when Nazi thugs in Nuremberg throw bombs at the court, and when the U.S. representative to the United Nations in New York declares, "The anti-fascist struggle is no longer fashionable," can we remain silent?

At the same time, American generals are praising germ warfare because it is easy to "research and manufacture in small laboratories and cannot be controlled." Hitler's bandits were crushed, but there are still some people who have completely inherited the tradition of Hitler's ringleaders, carrying out atomic bomb and new war intimidation in the world. Is there any intimidation in the world more despicable than using the threat of a new war to force people to submit to the will of the new world hegemon?

In every language, there are enough synonyms to allow them—who are actually fascists—to avoid using this historically tainted name to refer to themselves in their speech. At present, it is very fashionable to masquerade as "democratic," and even those Hitlerites in western Germany who have prospered with the help of the British and Americans are playing with this name, which is extremely precious to mankind, and calling themselves democrats. However, all of humanity knows very well that fascism is war! What difference is there between those who are now clamoring for a new war and actually preparing for war and the fascist bandits? Those American generals who are clamoring for the need to develop military bacteriology are not simply abstract lovers of their profession. Those American admirals and air marshals who are still experimenting with atomic bombs one year after the end of the war, which they had already experimented with during the war, are not simply experimenters; they do not hope to record the results of their re-experiments in their record books out of their love for science. Those American military men who advocate the standardization of military equipment in the countries of the Western Hemisphere are not simply people who worship uniformity; this group of people is preparing for a new imperialist war.

Literary workers, art workers, and cultural workers are the voices of the people who cannot be intimidated by police batons or bought off with gold thread. The people of the world hope to hear their voices from magazines, newspapers, books, theater stages, and silver screens—to hear the voices of the true people, to hear the voices of those who supported progressive humanity during World War II, those who, before World War II, answered the question posed by Gorky: "Cultural craftsmen, which side will you take?" and who bravely extended their hands to Gorky, passing through all guard lines amidst the clamor of fascist bandits and all enemies of humanity.

The world's outstanding writers have always used their voices to oppose those things that are hostile to the people's lives and happiness, to oppose the reactionaries of their own country and other countries, just as Émile Zola used his book "J'Accuse!" to oppose the reactionary militarists of France, and just as Leo Tolstoy used his book "I Cannot Be Silent" to relentlessly rebuke the reactionaries of Russia.

We know very well that there are also many people in your country who are loudly calling for the defense of world peace, culture, and democracy. They are glorious. But this letter is not addressed to them; it is addressed to those American cultural craftsmen who have not yet spoken out today, whose voices expressing their love for the millions of working people in all countries who are creating everything noble and beautiful with their labor have not yet been heard.

On behalf of all sincere and honest people around the world, we shout to you, the American cultural craftsmen: Please raise your voices to oppose the new threat of fascism! Oppose the instigators of war! Defend world peace and national friendship! Defend the close cooperation of cultures! Defend the happiness of mankind!

### 美国文化的友人们，你们要跟谁走？——苏联作家致美国作家的一封公开信

专栏：

    美国文化的友人们，你们要跟谁走？
    ——苏联作家致美国作家的一封公开信美国作家们！文化工作者们！
    我们寄给你们这封公开信，是因为我们担心着文化的命运，担心着人类的命运。在你们面前，我们不想掩饰自己忧虑的心情，不想闭起眼睛，不看威胁着文化命运的新危险。这种新危险，在我们同人类不可调和的敌人，——法西斯主义，作战刚刚结束之后接二连三的产生了。
    我们比任何人更锐敏地感觉到了这种危险，我们的国家在反对法西斯主义、保卫文化的斗争中，曾经受了难以置信的痛苦与灾难，曾遭受了巨大的损失，因此我们不能不、而且没有权利不指出这一新的威胁。
    我们愿意公开地、坦率地、知无不言地，象在人类社会中两年前还并肩作战的诚实伙伴一样，象不久以前在与共同敌人作战中一块流血的两个伟大民族的代表一样来说话。
    从未来文化命运的观点着想，贵国社会领导集团所作的许多远超过本国范围而影响到整个世界的事情，不能不使我们忧心如焚。
    我们请你们深深的想一想在反法西斯主义战争结束以后，贵国还存在着许多这样的人。他们各种外形的掩盖下，实际上宣传而且日益猖狂地在其实际行动中实现起最惨无人道的思想来了。这种思想是已被我们粉碎了的德国法西斯所宣传和实行的思想。
    法西斯主义思想就是崇拜暴力，就是种族歧视、“优等”种族统治世界的理论；就是人工地培养对其他民族及其历史、文化、国家建设轻视的心理；就是否认其他国家的主权，无理干涉其他国家内部生活的思想，但近来在贵国某些显要的政治活动家、外交官、军人、工业家、杂志记者甚至科学家中间不断地出现了这种思想的保护者与宣传者。
    难道这种不容许其他国家实行与美国不同理想不同制度的态度，不是与法西斯主义思想一样吗？难道贵国针对我国所发的新战争叫嚣，——这种叫嚣或许在你们中间某些人看来是一种司空见惯的现象而不足为奇——不是与法西斯主义一样吗？难道这种假借威吓，有时对其他国家采取暴力手段，以图攫取世界霸权，实现所谓“美国的世纪”，建立“世界新秩序”等，这一切不是法西斯主义简军的重演吗？贵国许多活动家天天在叫喊，应当把美国的社会秩序移植到世界各地去，认为只有美国的社会秩序，对于人类才是最合适的，这难道不是法西斯主义理论与实践的再现吗？要求赶快用原子弹消灭那些与美国制度不同的国家，这种叫嚣难道不是与法西斯主义思想一样吗？
    我们深信，绝大多数的美国民主人士，对于那些旧法西斯主义思想的美国继承人，利用他们的名字所大肆叫嚣的一切，是不会而且也不愿意负责的。如果我们没有这种信念，那么写这封信也没有意义了。
    我们知道，我国人民过去是而且将来也还是各式法西斯主义的敌人。我们相信，优秀的一贯和人民站在一起的文化工作者们，过去和将来也都是法西斯主义理论与实践的敌人。
    但我们之所以给你们写这封信，是因为我们对你们之中有许多人保持缄默的态度，深感惊奇。法西斯主义的代言人及其朋辈近来在贵国常常大肆叫嚣，然而真正美国文化的代表，法西斯主义的敌人，却很少讲话。
    作家、文化工作者是人类的良心，如果战争——它的结束已两年多了——仍在继续，他们能够保持缄默吗？
    自全世界各民族不应再继续发生流血斗争的条约签订以来，为时已经两年多了，但在两年中间，除不幸生在希腊、印度尼西亚、中国的人民外，在全世界各个角落里，每天都有许多无辜的儿童、妇女、儿子与普通老百姓在流血。显然，那些现在代表贵国实行法西斯主义思想的人，对世界各地已经死去或正濒于死亡的人民，应负主要的责任。在粉碎希特勒德国以后，在德国法西斯底千百万牺牲品之上，现在又天天增加着新的牺牲品，难道这就是那些在反希特勒战斗中光荣牺牲的你我全国同胞所应得的纪念碑吗？
    死了的人是不能复活了，可以侮辱他们，贬低他们的功绩，抹杀他们牺牲的意义，但是我们可以救一救活着的人，而每一个文化工作者保卫世界和平与民族友谊的呼声，也就是对于死者的纪念及为了活人的生活。如果在反法西斯战争结束后，仍可见到——不是在梦中而是在光天化日下——为美国金元力量所小心保护着的当政的法西斯暴徒，在斯巴达城将希腊青年斩首示众的事件，是不可能沉默的。当世界上还可以听到大炮的声音，荷兰军队在美元的帮助下焚毁六百万居民的住宅，中国爱国者被屠杀，西班牙的共和国分子被枪决，纽伦堡的法西斯匪徒向法庭投掷炸弹，出席联合国的美国代表在纽约声称：“反法西斯斗争已经不是时髦的东西了”的时候，我们能够沉默吗？
    同时，美国将军们正在赞美细菌武器，因为它便于“在小小的实验室里研究与制造，而无法管制。”希特勒匪徒是被粉碎了，但是还有一些人他们完全继承了希特勒罪魁的传统，在世界上进行原子弹与新战争的恐吓。世界上还有比利用新战争的威胁，强迫人民服从世界新霸主的意志更为可耻的恐吓行为吗？
    在各种语言中，都有足够的同句，使他们——实际上都是法西斯——在说话中避免采用这个在历史上有着污点的名字来称呼自己。在目前假冒“民主”是很时髦了，甚至德国西部那些在英、美帮助下繁荣起来的希特勒分子，也在玩弄这一个对人类极为珍贵的名字，而自称民主派。但是，全人类都非常清楚地知道，法西斯主义就是战争！试问那些现在正叫嚣新战争并在实际上准备战争的人们，和法西斯匪徒有什么区别呢？那些大叫必需发展军事细菌学的美国将军们，并不是一些对自己职业的单纯抽象的爱好者。那些在战争结束一年以后仍然实验在战时即已实验过的原子炸弹的美国海军上将与空军元帅，并不是单纯的试验者，并不是由于他们对科学的爱好，希望在自己的纪录簿上登记自己再次试验的结果。那些主张西半球各国军备标准化的美国军人们，并不是单纯崇拜整齐划一的人，这批人是正在准备新的帝国主义战争的人。
    文学工作者、艺术工作者、文化工作者，是那些警棍吓不倒、金线收买不了的人民喉舌。全世界人民希望从杂志、报章、著作中，从剧院舞台上，从银幕上听到他们的声音，听到真正人民的声音，听到那些在第二次世界大战期间曾给进步的人类以声援，在第二次世界大战前曾回答过，高尔基所提：“文化匠人你要跟谁走”的问题，并在法西斯匪徒及一切人类仇敌的叫嚣声中通过一切警戒线，而勇敢的向高尔基伸出了自己的手的人们的声音。
    全世界优秀的作家们，一向都是用自己的声音去反对那些敌视人民生活与幸福的东西，反对本国及其他国家的反动派，如同爱米尔·左拉用“我控诉”一书反对法国反动的军国主义分子，及列甫·托尔斯泰用“我不能缄默”一书对俄罗斯的反动派进行无情的斥责一样。
    我们很清楚的知道，在贵国也有许多人，他们为保卫世界和平文化与民主，在大声疾呼。他们是光荣的。但我们这封信并不是寄给他们的，而是寄给这样一些美国文化匠人们的，即他们在今天还没有发声，还听不到他们对世界各国千百万正在用自己的劳动创造一切高贵美满生活的老百姓表示热爱的声音。
    我们代表全世界一切诚恳正直的人民向你们美国的文化匠人们高呼：请提高自己的声音去反对法西斯主义的新威胁！反对战争煽动者！保卫世界和平与民族的友谊！保卫文化的密切合作！保卫人类的幸福！
