    Increased Production Must Be Organized
    Wang Yu
    This article by Comrade Wang Yu of the Qiu County Party Committee uses concrete facts to illustrate that whether poor or middle peasants want to increase production, they must be organized. This can provide some enlightenment for some comrades who still do not deeply understand the role of organization when reviewing and summarizing this year's production.
        —Editor
    In the production campaign in the first half of the year, there were two statements about increasing production: (1) The initial statement was: "Organizing can increase production, and not organizing can also increase production." (2) When weeding was completed, the statement was: "Organizing increases production more, and not organizing can also increase production." After testing by the masses' actual actions and detailed research by the leadership, both statements were deemed incorrect. These two statements are based on the position of the middle peasants, because the middle peasants have relatively complete livestock, farm implements, and production capital. Organizing can increase production more, and individual operation without organizing, as long as more plowing, harrowing, hoeing, and fertilizing are done, can also increase production. The middle peasants possess these conditions. If we speak from the position of the poor peasants (including the newly liberated poor peasants), they lack livestock, farm implements, and production capital. Without organizing, they cannot achieve the goal of increasing production. Because in the land reform, the poor peasants only obtained some land. To cultivate the land well, they still feel the lack of livestock, farm implements, and production capital. If it is said that they can borrow the livestock and farm implements of the middle peasants, they can only borrow them after the middle peasants have finished cultivating their land. This kind of cultivation will not be timely, and thus cannot increase production. In addition, having land does not equal having fertilizer. At the same time, they only received some land, and the grain is not enough to eat, and the clothes are not enough to wear. Often, even during the busy farming season (spring and summer), they have to spend most of their time engaging in sideline occupations to maintain their daily lives. Therefore, they cannot put all their strength into agriculture, which means they cannot hoe and sow in a timely manner, let alone deep plowing and careful cultivation. Therefore, poor peasants must organize to increase production. The following examples can prove it.
    Wang Dianchen's group in Taozhai, Second District, has thirteen households (eleven middle peasants, two poor peasants), five hundred mu of land, five livestock, and complete farm implements such as carts, plows, harrows, and seeders. The two poor peasants have no livestock, and the other middle peasants have one livestock for every two households. The whole group has thirteen laborers, with each laborer having thirty-seven mu of land. This spring, a mutual aid group was organized with Wang Dianchen as the backbone. Not only was the land cultivated very well, but also a steamed bun workshop and a flour mill were opened. In the first half of the year, a profit of 290,000 yuan was earned. The middle peasant component is the main one in this mutual aid group. Before the mutual aid, they did not engage in sideline occupations. This year, after organizing, not only was the land cultivated very well, but also the surplus labor force was invested in sideline occupations due to the labor-saving effect of mutual aid. Therefore, although middle peasants can increase production without organizing, organizing increases production even more.
    The Zhou Yonghua brigade in Xiangchenggu has a total of twenty-five households, twenty-three poor peasants and two middle peasants, with twenty-seven people participating in mutual aid. They are currently cultivating 531 mu of land. The whole team has a total of eighty full and semi-laborers, three plows, two harrows, and four seeders. The whole team has three oxen and three donkeys, with each livestock having eighty-eight mu, and one livestock for every four households. Although there is little land, if they are not organized, households without oxen will have to pull the plow (they can't even pull it themselves) and they don't have farm implements. Not to mention increasing production, they have no way to even cultivate the land. After they helped each other, they not only solved the difficulties of cultivating the land, but also finished weeding the land early and even weeded it again. Sideline occupations earned (in spring) more than 1.7 million yuan, which solved the difficulties of production and achieved the goal of increasing production. The operating method of this group is to draw a large part or all of the labor force to engage in sideline occupations when there is a fair, and to work in agriculture when there is no fair. Wang Xiewen's group in Xiangchenggu has a woman named Wang Chaishi who has a total of seven mu of land. She did not participate in mutual aid last year, and there were not enough seedlings in half of the land. The income from the seven mu of land was not enough for one person to eat. After participating in mutual aid this year, she did not go to the land at all, and the seedlings are growing very well. She spends two and a half days at home spinning a catty of thread, and each catty of thread is worth 1,000 yuan, earning a profit of 550 yuan. Wang Chaishi spun a total of 36 catties of thread in the three months of spring, totaling 36,000 yuan, with a net profit of 19,800 yuan in spring. Each mu requires four small laborers, and seven mu require twenty-eight small laborers to complete the plowing, sowing, hoeing, and work. Each small laborer gets three catties of millet, and twenty-eight small laborers require a total of eighty-four catties of millet. At 100 yuan per catty of millet, the wages for the seven mu of land are 8,400 yuan. The net profit from the 36 catties of thread is 19,800 yuan. After deducting the wages of 8,400 yuan, the net profit is 11,400 yuan. She bought fertilizer with the net profit, and this year each mu of millet can yield three large dou.
    Dong Chengniang of Li Shengzhuang did not participate in mutual aid last year and hired someone to cultivate the land. After handing over the public grain from the cultivation, only two bags of grain were left in the autumn. After participating in mutual aid this year, she exchanged labor by spinning and weaving, and also hoed the land in her spare time. This year, she only owes others eight labor days. This year, what she harvested is enough for the whole family to eat for the whole year. Also, Li Shumei and Li Qinghuai have the same composition and the same labor force. Li Shumei harvested one times more grain by participating in mutual aid last year than Li Qinghuai who did not participate in mutual aid.
    The above materials show that middle peasants increase production more by organizing; poor peasants (including newly liberated poor peasants) must organize to achieve the goal of increasing production. Therefore, in guiding production, we must unite the middle peasants with the poor peasants as the backbone to achieve the goal of increasing production through organization.

### 增产必须组织起来

    增产必须组织起来
    王玉
    邱县县委会王玉同志此文，用具体事实说明不论贫农中农要增产都必须组织起来，这对于一部分至今不深刻了解组织起来作用的同志，在检讨总结今年生产时可有一些启示。
        ——编者
    在上半年生产运动中，关于增产问题有两个说法，（一）开始的说法是：“组织起来能增产，不组织起来也能增产。”（二）当锄完地时说法是：“组织起来增产更多，不组织起来也能增产。”这两个说法，经过群众实际行动考验和领导上的详细研究，都认为是不正确的。这两种说法是站在中农立场上说的，因为中农牲口农具生产资本比较齐全，组织起来增产更多，不组织起来个体经营，只要多犁、多耙、多锄、多上肥，也能增产，中农是具备了这样条件的。如果我们站在贫农立场上说（新翻身贫农在内），他们在牲口农具生产资本都缺乏的情况下，不组织起来是不能达到增产目的的。因为土改中，贫农只是得到一些土地，要想把地种好，而牲口农具和生产资本还感觉缺乏，如果说他可借中农的牲口和农具用，那只好等中农将地耕完他才能借，这样耕作是不会及时的，也就不能增产。另外他有了地不等于有了肥料，同时只分到一些土地，粮食还不够吃，衣服不够穿，往往虽在农忙时（春夏季），还要拿出大部时间搞副业来维持日常生活，因此不能把全部力量用到农业上去，这样不仅不能及时的锄和耩，更谈不到深耕细作。因此贫农增产必须组织起来。下边几个例子可以证明它。
    二区桃砦王殿臣组，十三户（中农十一户、贫农二户），地五百亩，牲口五头，大车、犁、耙、耧等农具都全，两个贫农无牲口，其他中农合二户一个牲口，全组十三个劳动力，每个劳动力合三十七亩地，今春以王殿臣为骨干组织互助组，不但地种的很好，而且开了馒头坊粉坊。上半年得红利二十九万元，这个互助组中农成份是主要的。在未互助时他们都不作副业，今年组织起来，不但地种的很好，因互助省工将剩余的劳动力投入了副业，因此中农不组织起来虽也能增产，组织起来增产更多。
    香城固周永华大队共二十五户，贫农二十三户、中农二户，参加互助的二十七人，现种地五百三十一亩，全队全半劳力共八十人，有犁三张、耙二个、耧四个，全队三个牛、三个驴，每个牲口合八十八亩，每四户合一个牲口，虽然地少，如不组织起来，没牛户得拉犁（自己也拉不成）又没农具，不要说增产，连种地也没办法。他们互助起来，不但解决了种地困难，而且把地早早锄完还多锄一遍，副业赚钱（春季）一百七十多万元，解决了生产困难，达到了增产目的，这个组的经营方式，遇集抽大部或全部劳动力作副业，不遇集全部作农业。香城固王希文组内有一个妇女王柴氏共七亩地，去年未参加互助，地里半苗也不够，七亩地的收入不够一个人吃的，今年参加互助后，她没有到地里去过，并且苗子长的很好，她在家两天半的时间，纺线一斤，每斤线合洋一千元赚红利五五○元，王柴氏在春季三个月内共纺线三六斤，成洋三六、○○○元，春季净红利一九、八○○元，每亩须用四个小工，七亩须用二八个小工，即将七亩地犁、耩、锄、作完，每小工三斤米，二八个小工共须用小米八四斤，每斤米一○○元计，七亩地还工资八、四○○元，三六斤线子净赚红一九、八○○元，除还工资八、四○○元外，净落红利一一、四○○元。她把净赚的款买成粪，今年每亩谷子能收三大斗。
    李省庄东成娘去年没有参加互助，找人种地，除种地交公粮外，秋后仅剩下两口袋粮食。今年参加互助后，以纺织换工，在纺织空里也锄地，今年只欠别人八个工，今年收的够全家全年吃的。又李书梅、李青怀是同样的成份，同样的劳动力，李书梅去年参加互助收粮就比李青怀不参加互助多收一倍。
    以上的材料说明了中农组织起来增产更多；贫农（新翻身的贫农在内）要想达到增产的目的，必须组织起来。因此我们指导生产，要以贫农为骨干团结中农，组织起来才能达到增产目的。
