　　Taihang in a Year of Production
    Organizing to Overcome Difficulties
    The Taihang production campaign this year was carried out amidst numerous difficulties. However, the emancipated peasants used all their strength to overcome all difficulties. Despite the severe natural disasters, the entire region achieved an average harvest of 50% this year, with some areas even reaching 80-90%. The course of the struggle was as follows:
    During the spring plowing and sowing season, due to the needs of the war, a large number of young and middle-aged men from the east and west lines went to the front lines of Zhengtai and northern Henan to participate in the war. In Lucheng County alone, statistics show that more than 170,000 labor days (excluding livestock) were used for participating in the war and transporting grain. To solve this problem, various localities universally established unified leadership for war participation and production. Labor exchange committees, war participation committees, and headquarters, or relying on cooperatives and mutual aid teams, uniformly allocated the labor and livestock power of the entire village, creating a production form of "three combinations" (agriculture, sideline occupations, and war service) through a high degree of organization. A large-scale labor exchange between the front and rear was implemented, with unified accounting, unified conversion of work points, rotating participation in the war, rotating production, and organizing a large number of auxiliary laborers to participate in spring plowing and sowing, overcoming the contradiction between war service and production. According to statistics from Heshun during the sowing season, 17,925 women, children, and elderly men throughout the county were involved in the movement. In Lucheng, the organized full and semi-auxiliary labor force accounted for more than 70%. Even with a severe shortage of labor for war participation and transportation, more than 90% of the sowing plan was completed on time, and sideline production was maintained, earning a profit of more than 160 million yuan in half a year.
    Before the war participation had ended, the entire region suffered a prolonged drought (it did not rain thoroughly until late July), which caused great difficulties for sowing. In May, June, and July, many areas also suffered from severe hail and insect plagues in some areas, making the difficulties even more serious. However, the peasants were not intimidated, but actively organized themselves. Under the slogan of "Bring into play the struggle experience of 1942 and 1943, and overcome the famine," the poor and hired peasants took the lead, recalling the pain and struggle experience of the famine in 1942 and 1943. Every household calculated their possessions and made plans, closely combining production and conservation, and waged a tenacious battle against the famine, creating many struggle methods: mainly carrying water to plant and taking advantage of the gaps to rush plant and moisten plant (flood irrigation), send plant (dry seeding), borrow plant (borrowing moist soil from elsewhere), and find plant (removing dry soil to expose moist soil). In Neiqiu County alone, carrying water to plant, moistening plant, and rushing plant accounted for 84% of all autumn land. After the seedlings emerged, a seedling protection campaign was organized, with no fewer than four or five methods: digging ditches and wells to water, processing more hoeing, applying topdressing, covering seedlings with branches or grass, and helping up seedlings knocked down by hail. According to statistics from more than 900 villages in 22 counties, more than 500 large and small canals were repaired, 1,071 wells were dug and dredged, and 1,029 ponds were dug and dredged, increasing the area of watered land by 280,000 mu, which could increase production by 120,000 dan.
    During the production gap in July after the wheat harvest, various localities proposed summarizing the production in the first half of the year and rectifying mutual aid. County and district cadres first conducted a comprehensive inspection and summary, finding that at the beginning of spring, they had gone astray by not fully recognizing that the production mutual aid after land reform should be dominated by poor and hired peasants. After summarizing, it was clearly recognized that inspiring and grasping the positive ideas of poor and hired peasants for production, relying on them to understand the situation of various classes, and their being masters of their own affairs and leading production, was a very good leadership method for carrying out the movement. At this time, the leadership loudly put forward the idea of ​​going deep into the poor and hired to lead production, rectifying mutual aid, and boldly letting the masses re-combine voluntarily. In the rectification in various places, the ideas of two types of people were first studied: poor and hired peasants were leaders who actively produced without any worries. In Beiliu and Fengtuo villages in Licheng, 86% of the activists in land reform became activists in production, and 90% of the poor and hired became double activists, which is a very good proof. Conversely, those who have concerns about organizing production are only a small number of middle-peasant classes. In Cangrongzhuang, Changzhi, there was a couple with different backgrounds. The man, Shen Hai, was a middle peasant who had never suffered the pain of famine, and advocated eating one meal at a time, squandering recklessly; while his wife was from a poor peasant background, had experienced the pain of famine, and advocated saving money and planning for the long term to prepare for famine. Secondly, in rectifying mutual aid and establishing poor and hired backbones, attention was also paid to uniting middle peasants, mobilizing middle and poor peasants to recount their historical sufferings, and raising the awareness of middle peasants. The middle peasants quickly abandoned their wait-and-see attitude and joined the movement. After the rectification, the entire region smoothly launched the "three rush" campaign. For example, after the leadership of the Changzhi mutual aid group was 99% in the hands of the poor and hired, the mutual aid group quickly expanded to 3,165 (originally 3,078), organizing more than 80% of the total labor force. Although 1,500 people participated in the war and other work, in 25 days, 149 villages (out of a total of 182 villages) successfully completed the three rushes. (Taihang Branch)

　　太行一年生产中
    组织起来战胜了困难
    太行今年生产运动，是在困难重重中进行的。但翻身农民，用一切力量，克服了所有困难，虽在严重的天灾袭击下，全区今年也平均达到了五成年景，少数地区并达到了八至九成收。斗争的经过是这样的：
    在春耕下种时期，由于战争的需要，东西线大量青壮年，奔赴正太、豫北前线参战，仅潞城一县统计，参战、运粮用工即在十七万个以上（牲口未计）。在解决这一问题上，各地普遍建立了参战与生产的统一领导。变工委员会、参战委员会、指挥部或者依托合作社、互助队、统一支配全村的劳畜力，以高度的组织起来，创造了三大结合（农、副、战勤）的生产形式，实行前后方大变工，统一算帐、统一折工，轮流参战、轮流生产，组织大批辅助劳力参加春耕下种，克服了战勤与生产的矛盾。据和顺下种时统计，全县妇女、儿童、老汉一万七千九百二十五人卷入了运动。潞城组织起来的全半辅助劳力即占百分之七十以上，虽在参战义运劳力奇缺的情况下，亦按时完成了百分之九十以上的下种计划，并坚持了副业生产，半年获利一万万六千余万元。
    参战尚未结束，全区久旱不雨（七月下旬才落透雨），使下种遭到了极大的困难。五、六、七月许多地区又加上了严重的雹灾与部分地区的虫灾，致困难更形严重。但农民并未被吓倒，而是积极的组织起来，在“发挥一九四二、三年的斗争经验，战胜灾荒”的口号下，贫雇带头，回忆四二、三年的灾荒痛苦与斗争经验，户户算家当、家家订计划，扩大生产与节约密切结合，向灾荒进行了顽强的决斗，并创造了许多斗争办法：主要是担水点种与趁垧抢种、润种（满片灌水），寄种（干种）、借垧下种（从别处借湿土）、找垧下种（除去干土露出湿土）等，仅内邱一县担水点种、润种、抢种即占全部秋地百分之八十四。在小苗出土后，又组织了保苗斗争，办法亦不下四、五种：开渠打井用水浇，加工多锄，上追肥，用树枝或草盖苗，冰雹打倒的进行扶苗等，据二十二个县九百余村统计，修复大小渠五百余条，打井掏井一千零七十一眼，打池掏池一千零二十九个，新增水地二十八万亩，可增产十二万石。
    麦收后七月间的生产空隙，各地提出总结前半年生产整顿互助，县区干部首先进行了全面的检查与总结，发现开春由于没有充分认识土改后的生产互助应以贫雇为主体而走了弯路。经过总结，始明确认识到启发与掌握贫雇农生产的积极思想，依托他们了解各阶级的情况，他们当家作主领导生产，是开展运动的很好领导方法。此时领导上即响亮提出深入贫雇领导生产，整顿互助、大胆放手让群众重新自愿结合。各地整顿中首先研究了两种人的思想：贫雇农民是毫无顾虑的积极生产的带头人，黎城北流、风驼村，土改中的积极分子百分之八十六变为生产中的积极分子，而贫雇百分之九十当了双积极分子，即是很好的证明；相反的对组织生产存在顾虑的，仅是少数中农阶层。长治苍茸庄，有一对出身不同的夫妇，男人申孩是个中农，过去没有受过灾荒的痛苦，而主张吃了一顿算一顿，大肆浪费；而他老婆是个贫农出身，曾经过灾荒痛苦，主张省吃俭用，长期打算备荒。其次在整顿互助树立贫雇骨干中，并注意了团结中农，发动中、贫农诉历史苦，提高中农觉悟，中农即很快的放弃了观望态度，卷入到运动中来。经过整顿，全区即顺利开展了三抢运动。如长治互助组的领导权百分之九十九掌握到贫雇手里后，使互助组迅速扩大到三千一百六十五个（原三千零七十八个），组织起全部劳力百分之八十以上，虽有一千五百人参战及其他工作，二十五天中即有一百四十九个村（共一百八十二个村）胜利的完成了三抢。（太行分社）
