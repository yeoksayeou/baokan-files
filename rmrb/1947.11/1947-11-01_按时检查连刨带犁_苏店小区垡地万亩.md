    Inspect Plowing and Tilling On Time
    Su Dian District Completes Ten Thousand Mu of Plowed Land

    [This report from Changzhi] Since the Second District's Su Dian District inspected autumn plowing on October 19th, the masses have been highly motivated. To further advance the completion of autumn plowing, exchange experiences, and learn from each other, an expanded cadre meeting of the district was held on October 23rd. The autumn plowing plan was re-examined, and the concept of a "clean sweep" campaign was clearly proposed. According to the situation reported by various villages, the five villages have a total of 21,370 mu of autumn land, with 2,343 people participating in digging, and 339 livestock. Currently, 14,062 mu have been completed, leaving 7,308 mu. After summarizing, the following key experiences were identified: 1. Cadres conducted in-depth and precise calculations, dispelling the masses' paralyzing wait-and-see attitude, and comprehensively organized the autumn plowing campaign. For example, in Jiao Jia Zhuang, the main village had a lot of livestock, and the masses thought they could complete the work before the ground froze, so there was no need for people to dig. After the previous inspection, the village lagged behind. After the cadres returned and convened a meeting of the masses, the masses' thinking was changed through accounting methods, and they were all organized to form a campaign. 2. Cadres set an example by personally participating in mutual aid, influencing and promoting the masses, and promptly discovering and resolving problems. For example, in Bei Dong, the cadres first had their own women dig the land before calling on others. In Su Dian, during the digging, it was discovered that some people were willing to use livestock to plow the land, but unwilling to have people dig. The cadres immediately convened everyone for discussion. The main reason was that the wages for plowing and digging were different (8 jin of rice per mu for plowing, 10 jin of rice per mu for digging). After further discussion, it was decided that the wages for digging and plowing should be the same, and everyone became enthusiastic and willing to dig. In the Nan Tian He Cao Lin Shui brigade, this problem was also discovered. For example, Wang Qiu Sheng thought that digging the higher ground was not as good as plowing it. After Cao Lin Shui heard about this, he asked everyone to discuss it, and as a result, everyone realized that digging was not worse than plowing. After the thinking was cleared, everyone rushed to dig their own land. 3. Recording work based on output, with everyone evaluating the work, and issuing work vouchers at the work site, improved everyone's enthusiasm and gave play to everyone's initiative, forming a movement to grab work vouchers. Wang Chang Shui of the Nan Tian He Cao Lin Shui brigade was a very capable worker, but whenever he went to the work site, he would either sleep or sit and wait for everyone to arrive before starting. After Lin Shui discovered this problem, he used the method of calculating work based on output, with everyone evaluating the work, and issuing work vouchers at the work site. As a result, everyone became enthusiastic. Especially after the first batch of work vouchers was issued, everyone saw the benefits and became even more active. Now, the whole team has created a movement to grab work vouchers. 4. Launching a meritorious service competition and initiating a challenge to win the red flag movement. To complete the autumn plowing ahead of schedule, each village made red flags, and selections were held every three days to win the flags. In some villages, each street also made small flags, and groups challenged each other, and individuals challenged individuals, which greatly promoted the movement. 5. Collective leadership, democratic discussion, specific division of labor, and cadre responsibility. In this autumn plowing, the Su Dian District applied the methods of collective leadership and democratic discussion to implement the work. First, the cadre leaders held meetings to discuss and make decisions, and then specifically divided the work, with each person taking responsibility for their own tasks, without mutual dependence, and consciously completing their work tasks according to the plan. 6. Women's labor and family three-seven profit sharing, the whole family is happy. In Nan Tian He, when mobilizing women to participate in autumn plowing, some people's thinking was not clear. They thought that digging was hard work and it was more profitable to spin cotton and weave cloth at home, but they did not dare to say so. Cao Lin Shui guessed their thoughts and said to everyone: "Let's think about who we are digging for?" With just this one sentence, everyone's thinking was cleared, and they all realized that the money earned from digging was their own, and if they did not harvest next year, they would not be able to eat. Only then did they all take action. When distributing work vouchers, some families disagreed. For example, Bao Xi Niang said: "Eating the family's food and earning the family's rice is too unreasonable!" After Lin Shui heard about this problem, fearing that it would dampen the women's enthusiasm, he went to her house to explain, using his own family's three-seven profit-sharing method to clear her thinking, explaining that this way neither side would suffer. The wife was happy and said, "If that's the case, I still want to go to the fields!" 7. Solving leftover problems, rewarding women, work vouchers can buy goods, and can also be invested in shares. In Bei Tian He, the women of the Feng Gen Liu brigade were energized, mainly because when Feng Gen Liu mobilized women to go to the fields, the women said that earning work vouchers was useless. He first solved this problem, saying: "This year, earning work vouchers guarantees that you can go to the credit cooperative to exchange for rice and buy goods, and you can also invest in shares and earn dividends." Only then did they become energized. Seeing that everyone was very enthusiastic, Gen Liu rewarded five women with 100 yuan each, further encouraging everyone's enthusiasm and consolidating women's mutual aid. Finally, the purpose of the next phase of work was clarified: to complete autumn plowing, to launch a surprise attack on autumn stockpiling, and to propose a "clean sweep" campaign. By the next inspection, we must achieve "completely cleared, completely clean, three fast and non-stop," and complete the work by September 13th. Labor Hero Cao Lin Shui proposed that by November 11th, the village should be completed, and on the 12th, they would support the villages of Shan Tou and Jiao Jia Zhuang to help them complete autumn plowing early.

    按时检查连刨带犁
    苏店小区垡地万亩
    【本报长治讯】二区苏店小区自十月十九号检查秋耕后，群众的劲头非常大，为了进一步提前完成秋耕，交流经验，互相学习，十月二十三号召开小区扩大干部会议，再次检查秋耕计划，明确提出一扫光运动。根据各村谈的情况，五个村共有秋地二万一千三百七十亩，参加掘地人二千三百四十三个，牲口三百三十九头，现已完成一万四千零六十二亩，还有七千三百零八亩，经过总结，有以下几点经验：一、干部深入精确计算，打通群众麻痹等待思想，全面组织起来，开展了秋耕运动。如焦家庄，主村牲口很多，群众认为到地冻前能完成，就用不着人去掘，上次检查，他村落了后，经干部回去召集群众开会，用算帐办法打通了群众思想，已全部组织起来，形成了运动。二、干部以身作则，亲自参加互助，影响推动群众，并及时发现问题，及时解决问题。如北董干部先让自己家的妇女去掘地，再来叫别人；苏店在掘地时，发现有人愿意让牲口犁地，不愿意让人去掘，当下干部就召集大家讨论，主要原因是犁地掘地的工资不一样（犁一亩八斤米，掘一亩十斤米），后重讨论，规定掘地犁地一致，大家才起了劲，都愿意叫掘了。南天河曹林水大队，也发现这个问题，如王秋生认为掘上地不如犁上的好，曹林水听到后，就让大家讨论，结果大家认识掘地并不比犁地坏。打通思想，都抢着给自己掘地。三、按活记工，大家评工，地头按活发工票，提高了大家的情绪，发挥了每个人的积极性，形成了抢工票运动。南天河曹林水大队的王长水，是很能受的好手，可是每逢到地头，不是睡就是坐，等人齐了才动弹，林水发现这个问题后，就用了按活计工办法，大家评工，到地头就开工票，这一下大家就都起了劲，特别是发了一次工票后，大家看见有利，就更积极起来了，现在全队造成了抢工票运动。四、开展立功竞赛，发起挑战夺红旗运动，为了提前完成秋耕，各村都做红旗，三天评选夺一次。有的村各街还有做小旗的，组与组也挑战，个人与个人挑战，大大推动了运动。五、集体领导，民主讨论，具体分工，干部负责。在这次秋耕中，苏店小区都是应用了集体领导，民主讨论的方法来贯澈工作的，先有干部组长开会讨论，决定后，再明确的具体的分开工，各负各的责任，没有互相依赖，自动自觉的按计划来完成自己工作任务。六、妇女劳动和家庭三七分红，全家老少都高兴。南天河在这次秋耕中，动员妇女时有些人思想不通，认为掘地重，不如在家纺花织布赚钱大，又不敢这样提出来，被曹林水猜透了心思，就给大家说：“咱们想想掘地是为了谁？”就这样一句话，打通了大家的思想，都才认识了掘地赚下钱是自己的，明年收不上也是自己不能吃，才都动起来。到分工票时，有的家里不同意，如宝喜娘说：“吃上家里饭，再赚上家里米，太不合理！”林水听到这问题后，恐怕打击了妇女的情绪，就去她家给解释，用自己家庭三七分红办法来打通她的思想，说清这样两不吃亏，这一下老婆才高兴了，她说：“象这样我还要上地动弹哩！”七、解决遗留问题，奖励妇女，工票能买货，也能投资入股。北天河，冯根刘大队的妇女起了劲，主要是冯根刘在动员妇女上地时，妇女提出赚上工票不顶事，他首先给解决了，说：“今年赚上工票保证拿到信用社能兑米买货，还能投资入股，赚钱分红。”这样她们才起了劲，根刘看见大家的劲头很大，就奖励了五个妇女，每人大洋一百元，更鼓舞了大家的情绪，巩固了妇女互助。最后，明确了下期工作的目的，要完成秋耕，突击秋屯，提出一扫光运动，到下期检查时做到一干二净三快不消停，九月十三日定要完成。劳英曹林水提出，十一完成本村，十二去支援山头、焦家庄这两村，帮助他们秋耕早完成。（生秀、怀永、进穆、友学、永则、建章）
