Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th. American military atrocities in Nanjing are endless. From October 22nd to November 6th, in just half a month, three consecutive incidents occurred, resulting in the death or injury of four of our compatriots. American soldiers, completely devoid of humanity, actually regarded our compatriots as animals and shot at them with hunting rifles. According to a special dispatch from Nanjing on the 9th in the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao: at about 5:00 PM on the 6th, bricklayer Li Guangfeng and other workers were riding in a truck to near Yanziji. A jeep with three American officers inside was parked in the middle of the road, making it impossible for the truck to pass. When Li stepped forward to negotiate, he was shot in the face with a hunting rifle by an American officer. Li's left eye was blinded, and he fainted on the spot, and was sent to the hospital by his companions for treatment.

According to Nanjing newspapers: at about 10:00 AM on October 26th, American Major Rudolph drove a jeep with two female companions to Tangshan for hunting. After leaving Zhongshan Gate, he sped off at high speed. Near Qilinmen, he ran over an old man named Gao Wanyou, who was riding a donkey into the city to buy rice, killing him. The donkey also died at the same time.

At 7:50 PM on October 22nd, a jeep driven by an American soldier named Bash, at high speed, crashed into a rickshaw at the south entrance of Beiting Lane on Zhongshan East Road while making a turn. An elderly woman named Tang Huirong, a passenger in the rickshaw, suffered severe injuries to her chest, back of her head, and buttocks. She was sent to the hospital and died the next morning due to her injuries. The rickshaw puller, Zhang Wantao, was also injured.

Under the indulgence and protection of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, the three American murderers who slaughtered the Chinese people are still at large.

    另据南京报纸消息：十月二十六日上午十时许，美军少校鲁少夫，驾吉普偕女友两人赴汤山打猎，车出中山门外，即大开油门飞速驰骋，至麒麟门附近将骑驴入城购米之老翁高万友辗毙，毛驴亦同时毙命。
    十月二十二日下午七时五十分，美军巴许所驾吉普，在中山东路碑亭巷南口拐湾处，以高速率向一人力车撞去，车上乘客老妇唐慧融胸部、后脑及臀部均受重伤，送入医院后翌晨即因伤重毙命。人力车夫张万陶亦受伤。
    在卖国贼蒋介石纵容包庇下，屠杀中国人民的美军三凶手，至今仍均逍遥法外。
