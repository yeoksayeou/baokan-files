　　Huo Village Changes Work to Develop Sidelines
　　Eating Through the Winter Without Touching Autumn Grain
　　[This newspaper’s Changzhi dispatch] After continuously summarizing the "Three Autumns" (autumn harvesting, autumn planting, and autumn plowing), Huo Village in the Fourth District has fully and wholeheartedly shifted to winter production since the beginning of this month. After a mass meeting on the 8th of this month, every household and every group in the village universally calculated their annual income and expenditure. The conclusion was that out of the 66 households in the village, 41 could achieve "cultivating three and saving one" (having one-third of their harvest left over after consumption), 17 could achieve "cultivating two and saving one," and 7 could not even achieve "cultivating three and saving one" (only able to eat and clothe themselves adequately). It was also recognized that the key to the achievement of an 80% harvest in a 50% year (a year with only 50% of the normal expected rainfall) lay in organizing and implementing a "three-way combination" great change of work throughout the village. Finally, Comrade Fang Miniu also proposed: "Our calculations are all based on food, drink, and clothing, and we have not included all the needed furniture. For example, our village has increased its livestock a lot this year, but we haven't even bought a cart. A cart costs more than three stone of millet. If we don't produce well, we will still be in deficit." Hou Dongming said, "It takes five dou of millet to make a quilt." Everyone went back and calculated the deficit again, unanimously agreeing that it was imperative to develop winter production. It was immediately decided to continue using the change of work method. An oil mill was opened (which both earns money and accumulates fertilizer), and all livestock, except those used by the oil mill, participated in transportation. Under the slogan of "Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea, Each Showing Their Special Abilities," the work was clearly divided, and the methods for calculating work points and distributing dividends were redefined. All 40 male full laborers in the village were assigned: four to the Yincheng Ironware Shop, four to the village's work exchange, credit cooperative, and flour mill, fourteen to the oil mill, six to the coal kiln, two to the saltpeter workshop, and the remaining ten full laborers drove carts for transportation. All 25 usable livestock in the village, except for the five used by the oil mill, were organized into five transportation teams, with ten full laborers and ten half laborers (one full laborer leading one half laborer) responsible for driving the carts. The leadership composition was also reformed, with the poor and hired peasants as the backbone leaders. The target of struggle was kicked out of the cooperative, and a newly turned over peasant was put in place as manager. In this way, the village can earn 2.65 stone of millet, equivalent to more than 37,000 yuan (old currency), a day just from the saltpeter workshop, oil mill, coal hauling, and transportation. After the coal kiln produces goods, the village can have an income of 100,000 yuan a day. Their slogan is: "Make it so that eating, clothing, and expenses do not touch the autumn harvest grain!"

　　霍村变工开展副业
  　走吃一冬不动秋粮
    【本报长治讯】四区霍村经过连续总结三秋，从本月初已全面全力转上冬季生产。本月八号群众大会后，全村每户每组普遍进行算一年的收入和开支，得出的结论是：全村六十六户，能达到耕三余一的四十一户，耕二余一的十七户，达不到耕三余一（只能够吃够穿）的七户；并认识了：五成年景八成收的成绩关键在于组织起来，实行了全村三结合的大变工。最后，方米牛同志又提出：“咱们算帐都是从吃喝穿戴算的，没有把一切需用家具算进去，比如咱村今年增加牲口很多，可是连车都没有买，一辆车得用小米三石多，如不很好生产，还是亏空。”侯东明说：“盖条被子就得小米五斗。”大家又返回来计算了亏空，一致认为非开展冬季生产不行，当即决定仍以变工办法进行。开油坊一座（又赚钱又能积肥），牲口除了油坊用的以外，全部参加运输。又在“八仙过海各显能手”的口号下明确的分了工，并重新规定了折工计工和分红办法，全村四十个男全劳力，荫城铁货铺用四人，村的变工社、信用部、粉坊用四人，油坊用十四人，炭窑上六人，硝坊二人，其余十个全劳力赶车运输；全村能用的牲口二十五个，除油坊用五个以外，其余二十个组织了五个运输小组，十个全劳力十个半劳力（一全劳力带一半劳力）负责赶车。并在领导成份上加以改造，完全以贫雇为骨干领导，斗争对象从合作社踢出去，换上新翻身户为经理。这样，全村单硝坊、油坊、拉炭、运输一天可赚小米两石六斗五升，合洋三万七千余元，炭窑出货后，全村一天能有十万元的收入，他们的口号是：“做到吃穿开支不动秋收粮！”（立峰、保福、树掌、霍村通讯组）
