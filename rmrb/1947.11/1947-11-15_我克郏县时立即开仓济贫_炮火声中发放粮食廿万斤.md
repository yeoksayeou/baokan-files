Xinhua News Agency, Yu-Shaan Front, 13th: Frontline reporter Feng Mu reports: The People's Liberation Army opened granaries to relieve the poor during the street fighting in Jia County. On the 4th, when our assault troops entered the city, the staff immediately went into the city, opened the granaries, and distributed the grain that the Chiang bandits had plundered for many days to relieve the disaster. The poor people in the city, hearing the news, ignored the flying bullets and followed closely behind the victorious steps of the People's Liberation Army, cheering and rushing towards the granary. They shouted loudly: "Let's go, get the life-saving grain, Lao Wu's (referring to Wu Tinglin) troops are about to be finished!" When our army completely surrounded the enemy in North Street, more and more people came. The originally calm West City alley was already crowded with poor people receiving grain. At noon, our army launched a general attack, the sound of cannons shook the whole city, and the attacking troops galloped through the streets, but the number of people receiving grain did not decrease. The soldiers moved towards the front line while saying: "Go get the grain, Wu Tinglin will be captured alive soon!" And they often helped the old men and women who were receiving grain to put the grain bags on their shoulders. From the beginning of the attack to the end of the battle, it only took a few hours, and more than 200,000 jin of grain in the warehouse had been distributed. According to preliminary statistics, about 10,000 poor people received grain amidst the sound of cannon fire.
    Xinhua News Agency, Su-Lu-Yu-Wan, 13th: Inspired by the victory of the People's Liberation Army in breaking the Longhai Railway, the people in the vast area north of the railway to the Yellow River rose up to oppose traitors and distribute grain. On November 9th, in Sansheng Village (ie, Liukou Town, located at the junction of Su, Lu and Yu provinces), only ten miles away from the front line, all the people of the town, amidst the fierce gunfire, vigorously divided up more than 150 shi of grain that the pseudo-rebel Cao Yongnian had plundered from the people by taking advantage of his power. The Fucheng (newly established county) County Democratic Government gave active support, immediately arrested many traitors and collaborators in the vicinity, and the people's emotions were even higher. All men, women, old and young in Shilo Village started together, and in less than half an hour, they divided up more than 10,000 jin of grain from the home of the evil landlord Shi Baozhang, who colluded with the Chiang bandits to oppress the people, and found four long and short guns.

　　我克郏县时立即开仓济贫
  　炮火声中发放粮食廿万斤
    【新华社豫陕前线十三日电】前线记者冯牧报导：解放军在郏县巷战中，即开仓济贫。四日，我突击部队攻入城内时，部队工作人员立即入城，打开粮库，将蒋匪搜刮多日的粮食发放济灾。城内贫民闻讯，不顾流弹横飞，紧随解放军胜利脚步之后，欢呼涌向粮仓。大声叫着：“走呀，领救命粮去，老武（指武庭麟）的队伍眼见就要完了！”当我军将敌全部包围于北街时，人愈来愈多，原来很冷静的城西小巷，已经挤满了领粮的穷人。中午，我军发动总攻，炮声震动全城，攻击部队满街奔驰，领粮的群众却没有因此减少。战士们一面向火线运动，一面说：“去领粮吧，马上就要活捉武庭麟了！”并时时帮助领粮的老汉和妇女把粮袋扶上肩头。从开始攻击到解决战斗不过几小时，仓库中的二十余万斤的粮食已经发完了。据初步统计，在炮火声中领到粮食的穷人，约有一万人。
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖十三日电】在解放军破击陇海路的胜利鼓舞下，铁路以北至沿黄河之间广大地区，人民奋起反奸分粮。十一月九日，距前线仅十余里的三省庄（即刘口镇，位于苏鲁豫交界处），全镇人民于激烈枪炮声中，风起云涌的把伪逆曹永年仗势掠夺人民的一百五十多石粮食，全部分光。复程（新设县）县民主政府当予积极支持，立即逮捕附近奸伪分子多人，人民情绪更为高涨。石楼村全村男女老幼一齐动手，不到半小时，就将勾结蒋匪欺压人民的恶霸地主石宝章家囤粮一万多斤一分而尽，并搜出长短枪四支。
