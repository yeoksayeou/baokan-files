Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th: Washington dispatch: The impending economic crisis in the United States, coupled with the surge in the power of the people in France and Italy, has frightened Truman into crying out that "delay is dangerous." Contrary to his previous public statements, he has decided to convene a special session of Congress on November 17th. According to a US Information Service dispatch from Washington on the 24th, Truman stated in a national broadcast on the evening of the 24th that the two "urgent reasons" for calling the special congressional session were, firstly, the "alarming rise in prices" in the United States. He admitted that this had caused "most people's income increases to be offset by the high cost of living, and millions of middle and lower-class families have become victims of inflation. They have used up their savings and are relying on debt to survive." Thus, Truman exclaimed: "When so many people do not benefit from prosperity, the road to depression (i.e., economic crisis) lies ahead," "No one can ignore this danger," "Merchants and bankers will remember how much they suffered in 1929." Truman requested Congress to take legislative action to "curb" the danger of inflation. Truman also stated that another reason for convening the special Congress was "Europe needs urgent assistance." However, among the sixteen Western European countries shrouded in crisis, Truman emphasized only France and Italy, indicating that the so-called "danger this winter" in these two countries is mainly due to the fear of the powerful forces demonstrated by the French Communist Party and the Italian People's Bloc in the recent municipal elections. He attempts to use this to save the declining trend of the reactionaries in these two countries.

    美帝将开国会特别会议
    图给法意反动派救命
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】华盛顿讯：美国经济危机的迫近，与法意两国人民力量的激增，吓得杜鲁门发出“拖延就是危险”的哀号，并一反其历次的公开声明，决定于十一月十七日召开国会特别会议。据美新闻处华府二十四日电，杜氏二十四日晚向全国广播，在其声明召开特别国会的两大“紧迫原因”中，其一为美国“物价之惊人上涨。”他自承认这已使“大多数人收入之增加抵不上生活费之高涨，数百万中下级家庭，已成为通货膨胀的牺牲者。他们已用光他们的储蓄，依靠举债度日，于是杜氏惊呼：“当这么多人受不到繁荣的时候，不景气（按即经济危机）的路就摆在面前了，‘这种危险无人可以忽视’，‘商人银行家将记得他们在一九二九年受到何等的痛苦”。此杜氏要求国会采取立法行动，以“制止”通货膨胀的危险。杜氏又称：召开特别国会之另一原因为“欧洲需要紧急援助”。但在危机笼罩下之西欧十六国中，杜氏所强调者则仅为法意二国，此显示杜氏口中所谓该二国之“今冬危险”者也主要是慑于法共与意大利人民集团在最近市选中所表现之强大力量，企图借此挽救该二国反动派之颓势。
