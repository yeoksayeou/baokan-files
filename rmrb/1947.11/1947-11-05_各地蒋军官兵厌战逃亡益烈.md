Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 1st -- The East China People's Liberation Army, in the battle to capture Xin'an Town between Funing and Guanyun, seized the "National Defense Monthly" Volumes 2, Nos. 4 and 5, published by the Chiang bandit Ministry of National Defense, which contained Order No. 1065 from the Chiang bandit Combined Service Headquarters and the Military Police Headquarters, wanted for deserting officers. The order included statistics from a survey conducted in November and December of last year, which revealed that the number of deserting officers from Chiang's troops and military organs reached as high as 548, spread across Chiang's army, navy, and air force, military academies, military police, armored corps, railway corps, and over 150 important agencies and units. Among them, those at the rank of general or colonel reached 37, including Zhu Yongbao, the Major General Director of the Recruitment Office in Northern Henan; Li Shouxi, the Colonel Commander of the 176th Regiment of the 59th Division; Zhang Binruo, the Colonel Chief of Staff of the Huanglong Mountain Area Garrison Headquarters; Wan Jusun, the Lieutenant Colonel Warehouse Chief of the 14th Station Sub-supervisory Department of the Combined Service Headquarters; and Liu Donghai, the Lieutenant Colonel Warehouse Chief of the Nanjing Regulation Warehouse of the Management Department. Although the Chiang bandits clearly stated the appearance and characteristics of the deserters on the wanted list and ordered strict investigation and handling, the desertion incidents continued to increase. The number of deserters in November of last year was 194, but by the beginning of December, it had increased by 82 percent to 353. And this is only the publicly available official statistics; the actual number is likely to be far greater.

    各地蒋军官兵厌战逃亡益烈
    【新华社华东前线一日电】华东解放军于攻克阜宁、灌云间新安镇之役中，缴获蒋匪国防部出版之“国防月刊”第二卷第四、第五两期，载有蒋匪联勤总部、宪兵司令部藉字第一零六五号命令，通缉逃亡官佐，该命令中统计去年十一、十二两月调查，蒋军各部队、各军事机关逃亡官佐竟达五百四十八名之多，遍及蒋陆、空、海军，军官学校、宪兵、装甲兵团、铁道兵团等一百五十余重要机关单位。其中将校级者即达三十七名，包括豫北招募处少将处长朱永宝、五九师一七六团上校团长李寿溪、黄龙山区警备司令部上校参谋长张彬若、联勤总部十四兵站分监部中校库长万矩荪、经理署南京调节仓库中校库长刘东海等。蒋匪虽在该通缉令上写明逃亡者面貌，特征，严拿究办，逃亡事件却仍有增无减，去年十一月份逃亡者为一百九十四名，十二月份初即增加百分之八十二，达三百五十三名，而此仅系官方公开统计，实际当远超过此数。
