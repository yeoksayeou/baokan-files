A certain unit of the Democratic Allied Forces has universally launched a battle evaluation (combat review meeting) campaign during the break in the Autumn Offensive. The Democratic Allied Forces Headquarters has called on the entire army to launch this campaign. The experience of this unit is as follows: The purpose of battle evaluation is to summarize the combat experience of the masses using mutual review methods to improve the troops' tactics and techniques. The central content is: evaluating tactics, evaluating techniques, evaluating bravery, evaluating political work, and evaluating casualties, etc. In holding tactical review meetings, each combat action can be specifically demonstrated in order to point out its advantages and disadvantages. The combat actions of soldiers should be reviewed, and the command of squads and platoons by cadres should be reviewed. Comparisons of good and bad should be used to enlighten everyone. The battle evaluation campaign can also be combined with merit evaluation. In the campaign, the principle of focusing on praise should be adhered to. Before launching the campaign, the concerns of cadres about losing prestige should be dispelled, and the spirit of cadres' self-criticism and humbly learning from soldiers should be promoted. At the same time, the military and the political should be united to carry it out in coordination.
