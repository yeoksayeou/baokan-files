Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 27th: Rome dispatch: The Italian Socialist Party, in building a new front of democratic forces, has decided to strengthen its cooperation with the Communist Party and called on various regions to establish "People's Democratic Front" committees. At the recent plenary session of the Central Committee of the party, the Secretary of the Socialist Party, Bassi, in his political report, announced that the current number of party members has reached 900,000. Bassi proposed at the plenary session: "Establish a broad front for the struggle for Italian New Democracy" and "People participate in the administration and economic management of the state" as the party's main tasks in the future political struggle. Bassi forcefully stated: This front should not be merely an electoral alliance, nor should it be limited to agreements between leaders. In order to realize its lasting influence in Italian political life and play a leading role in it, this front will be implemented in various regions. The plenary session passed a resolution approving the party's leading organs to have the initiative to incorporate all political and social forces that care about protecting the republic and democracy and saving the national economy into this front, thereby further expanding the Socialist Party's agreement on joint action with the Communist Party. The resolution also approved the proposal put forward by Bassi on behalf of the party's leading organs: to convene an emergency party congress at the end of this year to mobilize party members for the party's current urgent task (establishing a broad front of democratic forces). The resolution also called on all local branches of the party to establish "People's Democratic Front Committees" with representatives from various progressive political groups: trade unions, cultural, public opinion, women's, youth, and guerrilla alliances, veterans' alliances, etc.

    【新华社陕北二十七日电】罗马讯：意社会党在建立民主势力新阵线中，决加强与共产党之合作，并号召各地成立“人民民主阵线”委员会。社会党书记巴苏在最近召开的该党中央委员会全会上作政治报告时，宣布该党目前党员数达九十万人。巴苏在全会上提出：“成立为意大利新民主主义而奋斗的广泛阵线”以及“人民参加国家行政与经济的管理”，作为该党在未来的政治斗争中的主要任务。巴苏力称：这一阵线不应只是选举联盟的性质，也不应局限于各领袖间的协议，为了要在意大利政治生活中实现其持久的影响，并在其中起领导作用，这个阵线将在各地付诸实现。全会通过决议，批准该党领导机关有主动权，将关怀保卫共和国和民主以及挽救国民经济的一切政治与社会势力，容纳入这一阵线，从而进一步扩大社会党与共产党联合行动的协定。决议亦批准了巴苏代表该党领导机关提出的建议：在今年底召开党的紧急大会，为了党的当前迫切任务（成立民主势力广大阵线）而动员该党党员。决议并号召该党所有地方支部应成立有各进步的政治团体：工会、文化、舆论、妇女、青年及游击队员联盟、退伍军人联盟等代表参加的“人民民主阵线委员会”。
