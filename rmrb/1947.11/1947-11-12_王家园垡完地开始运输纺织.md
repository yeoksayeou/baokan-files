　　【This newspaper, Taiyue, 10th】 Qinyuan Wangjiayuan's crash autumn land turning is complete, and it is transitioning into winter production. The Wangjiayuan Village Mutual Aid Team, under the leadership of Wang Shuihou, using 25 head of livestock, from October 16th to November 6th, in 20 days, turned all 174 mu of autumn land in the entire village. Since Wang Shuihou received the special commissioner's reward, everyone's morale has been unusually high, and they are tackling the autumn land turning with even more of a crash spirit. He said, "Wangjiayuan has never received a reward in generations. This time we have made contributions, and autumn land turning is even more important. We must continue to be model contributors!" Their ideological emphasis on autumn land turning has led them to carry it out in a more planned and organized manner. They divided the four natural villages into four detachments, selected autumn land turning team leaders, and let Wang Gennen, Wen Youhe, and others with high land turning skills specifically manage the livestock and lead the land turning. Women didn't use livestock for milling flour and other odd jobs, saving animal power. After the old men were commended, they also actively came out to handle plows. Under the overall mobilization, all the village's land was turned by the 6th of this month. Now, in addition to extracting Wang Sannian, Wen Youhe, and others with five head of livestock to help with land turning in Chengguan, they have also extracted five people and three head of livestock for transportation. All 90 of the village's female laborers have also set a three-month winter textile plan, with each person spinning ten jin of cotton.
