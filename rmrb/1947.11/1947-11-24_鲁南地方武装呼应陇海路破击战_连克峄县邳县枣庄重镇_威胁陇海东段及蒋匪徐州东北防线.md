Xinhua News Agency, East China, 22nd. In coordination with the large-scale destruction battle launched by the Su, Lu, Yu, and Wan Liberation Army west and south of Xuzhou, our local armed forces in southern Shandong successively captured important towns such as Yixian, Pixian, and Zaozhuang on the 17th and 18th, controlling over a hundred li of railways east of Meiyao on the Tai'erzhuang-Zaozhuang Road and north of Tai'erzhuang on the Lincheng-Zaozhuang Road, as well as the vast areas near Yi, Zao, and Pi. This seriously threatens the eastern section of the Longhai Railway and the northeast defense line of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Xuzhou. On the night of the 17th, we launched an offensive centered on Pixian city. After a night of fighting, with a casualty ratio of 30 to 1, we captured the city, annihilating most of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' five security teams and the county government. According to preliminary statistics, over 180 enemies were captured, a portion were killed or wounded, and over 70 strong laborers detained by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits were liberated. After our troops entered the city, they immediately opened warehouses to provide relief to the poor, distributing all of the over 200,000 jin of wheat hoarded by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits to the poor masses. The unit then took advantage of the victory to sweep away the puppet bandits, successively capturing strongholds such as Chahe and Guanhutun. Another unit of our army captured over 30 Chiang Kai-shek bandit town chiefs and others with four bullets on the same night, occupying Zaozhuang (once recovered on October 24th, this is the second time), and the remaining enemies fled south. On the morning of the 18th, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Yixian gathered over a thousand people from the county brigade and others to attempt a counterattack on Zaozhuang. At 11:00 AM, our army counterattacked, annihilating a portion of the enemy, and took advantage of the victory to occupy Tancheng, Peishan, and other places in the northeastern suburbs of Yicheng, directly approaching Yixian city. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the defending enemy fled south in a panic, and the city was recovered by us.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 20th. Late News: Bohai Comprehensive War Report: (1) On October 26th and 29th, our Jinan Local Corps scored a major victory on the north bank of the Jianhe River northeast of Qingxian, defeating a portion of the Chiang Kai-shek New 2nd Army and bandit puppet troops, totaling over a thousand, who were invading from Duliuzhen, Jinghai City, and Tangguantun. A total of 280 Chiang Kai-shek bandits were captured, and nine various cannons and 129 machine guns were seized. (2) Our Hui Muslim armed forces, active in the suburbs of Jinan, defeated over 300 Chiang Kai-shek bandits who invaded from Queshan on October 25th, killing and wounding over ten, including their company commander Qin Zhonglian. (3) In mid-to-late October, our 3rd Military Subdistrict troops swept away the enemy's Security 3rd Division on both sides of the Erhe River, and most of the area west of the Erhe River in Shouguang was recovered. (4) On October 23rd, the Bohai Cavalry Brigade killed and captured over a hundred enemies from Qi who were harassing the area in Heilizhai, south of Qingcheng, and seized two machine guns. In addition, the people of Shouguang, Guangrao, Gaoyuan, Yaonan, Huantai, Zouping, and other counties in our 3rd Military Subdistrict launched a political offensive and an anti-grain-grabbing and anti-conscription guerrilla war. Shouguang County destroyed 35 puppet regimes, dispersed 13 bandit special agent armed forces, suppressed 21 landlords and special agents who carried out retaliatory liquidation, and forced the retreat of 3 puppet strongholds. The militiamen of the San District of Yaonan killed 22 enemies, including the battalion commander and special agent captain Meng Qingxiu, and captured 16 alive. The militiamen of the Hexi District of Gaoyuan used sparrow warfare to harass a battalion of the enemy's 12th Army, causing them to be unable to eat or sleep peacefully. The militiamen of the Jinling District of Huantai cut nine li of enemy telephone lines, and the militiamen of the Cuilou District defeated the enemy who came out of Huancheng to conscript soldiers, rescuing more than 50 people. The Zouping Worker's Team militia defeated over a hundred enemies who were conscripting laborers to repair roads. A total of over 220 battles, large and small, were fought, killing, wounding, and capturing over 450 enemies.
