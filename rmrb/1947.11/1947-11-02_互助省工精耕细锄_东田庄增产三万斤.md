    [This report from Jinnan on the 31st] Mutual aid in Yuanchao's Dongtianzhuang village has increased grain production by more than 30,000 jin. They are now preparing to engage in large-scale sideline production in the winter. Last year, the mutual aid groups in Dongtianzhuang collapsed entirely due to formalism in leadership. When mutual aid was proposed this spring, the masses were unwilling. At this time, the leadership carried out different publicity and mobilization according to the different ideas of the masses, and used the specific examples of increased production through mutual aid in other villages to enlighten and educate them, which broke through the thinking of some of the masses. Then, a meeting of activists was convened, followed by individual liaisons, and the village's mutual aid situation was opened up. Of the 131 households in the village, 120 households were organized into 17 groups. Only nine households of landlords who had been struggled against and two households of military dependents without labor did not participate. In order to increase production, they were highly motivated. Therefore, this year's mutual aid has achieved significant results compared to last year's non-mutual aid. Last year, 1936.3 mu were cultivated, and this year it was 2075.9 mu. Last year, stubble land was 883 mu, and this year it was 1036.2 mu. The area of cultivated stubble land increased by 291.5 mu compared to last year. In addition, 12,917 trees were planted, 64.3 mu of cuttings were inserted, and 707 trees were planted along the field edges. In terms of leadership in accumulating fertilizer, last year there were 90 manure pits in the village, and a total of 1752 cartloads of fertilizer were accumulated. This year, after mutual aid was established, the groups launched challenges against each other. The number of manure pits increased to 124, and 3743 cartloads of fertilizer were accumulated, more than half as much as last year. During weeding, the groups competed to earn merit. Last year, the land was weeded two to three times, while this year it was weeded three to five times. Due to the above reasons, the village harvested a total of 126,477 jin of grain last year, and a total of 161,410 jin of grain this year, an increase of 34,933 jin over last year, with an average increase of 13 jin per mu of cultivated land. In the process of mutual aid, lazy people were also transformed; anyone who did not participate in mutual aid felt embarrassed and did less work. Xin Wu used to be a person who didn't work much, but since participating in mutual aid, he himself admits that he has done half as much work this year as last year. He said, "My 20 mu of land yielded 391 jin more grain than last year. Each mu yielded 15 jin more. It won't work without mutual aid." From concrete comparisons, the whole village recognized that mutual aid resulted in more work and more grain, and the enthusiasm for production was greatly increased. Now, after rushing to complete the wheat sowing, the village is preparing to engage in large-scale sideline production in the winter.

    互助省工精耕细锄
    东田庄增产三万斤
    【本报冀南三十一日电】元朝东田庄互助增产三万多斤粮，现正准备冬季大搞副业。东田庄去年互助组因领导上的形式主义，全部垮了。今春提出互助后，群众都不愿意。这时领导上根据群众的不同思想进行了不同宣传动员，又用外村互助多生产的具体事进行了启发教育，打通了部分群众思想。接着召开了积极份子大会再进行个别串连，该村互助遂打开了局面。全村一百三十一户，组织了十七个组一百二十户，仅有九家被斗地主和两户无劳力的军属未参加。他们为了增产，生产情绪很高。因此今年互助增产比去年不互助有了显著成绩。去年耕种了一九三六．三亩，今年二零七五．九亩，去年茬地八八三亩，今年一○三六．二亩，耕茬地比去年增二九一．五亩。另外还植树一二九一七株，插条子六四．三亩，地头庄条七零七棵，在领导积肥上，去年全村九十个粪坑，全体积肥一七五二车。今年互助起来后，组与组掀起了挑战，粪坑增至一二四个，积肥三七四三车，比去年多了一半。锄地时各组比赛立功，去年地都是锄两遍至三遍，今年锄到三遍至五遍。由于以上原因，去年全村共收粮一二六四七七斤，今年共收粮一六一四一零斤，比去年多收三四九三三斤，每亩耕地平均增产十三斤。在互助中，并改造了懒汉；谁不参加互助即感觉作难，少干活。辛武过去是不大干活的人，自参加了互助，自己承认今年比去年多干一半活。他说：“二十亩地比去年多打三九一斤粮。每亩多收十五斤，不互助可不行。”从具体对比中，全村都认了互助干活多，打的粮食多，生产情绪大大提高。现该村突击完成种麦后正准备冬季大搞副业。
