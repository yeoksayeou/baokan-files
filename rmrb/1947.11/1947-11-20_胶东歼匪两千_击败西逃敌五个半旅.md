Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 18th. On the eve of the October Revolution Day, the People's Liberation Army once again approached the Gao (mi) - Wei (xian) section of the Jiaoji Railway, completely defeating the entire reorganized 9th Division of the Chiang bandits, which had fled west for the second time, as well as remnants of the Chiang bandit reorganized 64th Division, the 198th Brigade of the reorganized 54th Division, and the 309th Regiment of the 103rd Brigade of the reorganized 8th Division – a total of five and a half brigades, annihilating over 2,000 enemies. It is reported that after the Chiang bandit reorganized 9th Division was attacked by our forces in the Jiaohe River battle at the beginning of this month and failed to flee west, it fled west again from Gaomi along the Jiaoji Railway on the 6th of this month. That night, our army suddenly appeared on their westward escape route and surrounded them. After three days and nights of fierce fighting, over 1,500 bandits were annihilated, and the remaining bandits were compressed into a few isolated strongholds such as Dama Bay northwest of Gaomi. On the 8th, the Chiang bandit reorganized 54th Division's 198th Brigade, which had fled south from Pingdu, joined with the remnants of the Chiang bandit reorganized 64th Division in the Jiao (xian) - Gao (mi) area and hurriedly moved west to reinforce. While our army took advantage of the victory to recover Pingdu city on the 8th, another crack force continued to block the enemy's westward escape route. By the 13th, the enemy troops had completely collapsed and were forced to turn around and flee back east. Our army rose up to pursue and killed, wounded, and captured over 500 more enemies, seizing a large number of materials and vehicles.

[Another dispatch] A unit of the People's Liberation Army attacked the enemy stronghold in Wangtuan, more than 60 li north of Jimo city, on the 7th, completely annihilating three local returnee corps, capturing 74 alive, killing and wounding 42, and seizing 30 rifles.
