Investigate Leaders, Investigate Understanding, Investigate Wages, Investigate Achievements:
Lucheng Second District Carries Out Four Investigations

[Our Newspaper, Lucheng News] In the villages of Xiliu, Huangniuti, Shanghuang, and others in the Second District, a "Four Investigations" movement—investigating leaders, investigating understanding, investigating wages, and investigating achievements—has been widely carried out within mutual aid teams in conjunction with the autumn harvest, wheat planting, and autumn plowing. This has greatly boosted the production enthusiasm of the peasants, further crushed the feudal landlords on the production front, and enabled the poor and hired peasants to seize great power, which has greatly promoted the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and wheat planting. The Xiliu village convened a meeting of poor and hired peasant families, and through casual conversations, discovered that the main reason for the lack of enthusiasm in mutual aid was that the poor and hired peasants were not in charge, and the heads of the groups and squads were still controlled by feudal rich peasants and old middle peasants. After two days of deliberation and coordination, a fierce Four Investigations movement was launched. In Guo Guoyan's group, although a poor peasant was the nominal leader, he was actually commanded by the rich peasant Li Jingou. On the surface, they were helping each other, but in reality, they were each looking after themselves. Group leader Guo Jinyi said, "I heard that others even expelled the poor peasant Shen Haiquan, which is really wrong." Jiang Xiaochou is a rich peasant, and his group of four households are all rich peasants. The mutual aid team is not expanding because he is afraid that others will get his property. Liu Jijun even became the captain of the brigade, and the masses have long wanted to replace him, but they are afraid that the village cadres will protect him. In this Four Investigations, these bad elements were unanimously squeezed out, and poor and hired peasant group leaders and squad leaders were replaced to lead everyone. In Huangniuti village, this year's production has been inconsistent, mainly due to the leadership of middle peasants and feudal landlords, who account for the majority in the village. On October 12th, a meeting of poor and hired peasants was convened, and the leaders immediately expressed their resolute support for everyone and used the "four comparisons"—comparing lives, comparing labor, comparing status, and comparing crops—to identify cadres such as the volunteer teacher, captain, group leader, and women's salvation propaganda who were still feudal landlords. The poor and hired peasants all said, "Shen Tuchang is an object of struggle, but he can still be a volunteer teacher. What is he? He still educates people. He hasn't bowed his head yet, and he has harvested more than ten stones of wheat this year. Which of us peasants can harvest so much? Speaking of labor, we are working ourselves to death from morning till night all year round. In name, we have been liberated, but in reality, we don't even have livestock. People who have been struggled against are still feeding half a donkey. What do they eat, what do they wear, and they are still cadres. We have been liberated, but we have nothing, except that we have more corvée labor than others." Liang Zhaoqun said, "I raised an opinion at a cadre meeting, and the chief scolded me like a mad dog." After discussion, the poor and hired peasants seized power, and quickly launched the autumn harvest, wheat planting, fallow land cultivation, and Four Investigations movement. Landlords and bad elements were quickly squeezed out, and poor and hired peasants were re-elected as leaders. The masses discussed and strictly managed the landlords. In the Shanghuang village, the village cadres boldly supported the poor and hired peasants and let the liberated peasants inspect the village leadership. Through mobilization, the ideological consciousness of the poor and hired peasants was raised, and they recognized the feudal landlords. It was found that Cai Liang Renfude, Jin Caixian, Zhang Junying, and other feudal rich peasants were still cadres. After the masses investigated the leaders and squeezed them out, the masses re-elected the poor and hired peasants to take charge and lead production, and the masses discussed and strictly managed the landlords. The "Four Investigations" movement is now being promoted throughout the district. (Shi Tuchang, Guo Zhuhai, Qin Buliu, Jin Liukuan)
