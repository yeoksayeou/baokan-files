Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th – The Chiang-US "Relief Agreement" was formally signed in Nanjing on the 27th. The content of the agreement fully exposes the US imperialists' intention to aid Chiang in the civil war and to invade China under the guise of "relief." The agreement was formulated in accordance with the US Congress's $350 million "Foreign Relief Act" passed in May this year, the purpose of which is to assist reactionary factions in various countries against the people of those countries, in order to facilitate US aggression. The agreement stipulates that relief materials may be used to support Chiang Kai-shek's "price controls," which are implemented to plunder the wealth of the people and supply his civil war. The distribution of relief materials is stipulated to be carried out through commercial channels and by so-called "voluntary organizations already established in China" agreed upon by both the Chiang government and the US. The "proceeds" from the sale of "relief materials" will be deposited into a "special account" in the name of the Chiang government and can only be disbursed with the consent of the US representative. All of this shows that these "relief materials" can be used for non-"relief" purposes. Under this agreement, US imperialism obtains the following privileges: First, the agreement repeatedly stipulates that the United States has "direct supervision and management rights" over this "relief," for which the US government will dispatch a large "delegation" to China. Second, these US representatives have the right to "travel freely throughout China," and the Chiang government must "permit and facilitate" this. Since the Japanese surrender, the United States has continuously sought the freedom to collect military intelligence and explore China's economic resources throughout China. The above provisions are precisely to implement this aggressive step. Third, the agreement also explicitly stipulates that Chiang Kai-shek should take "all feasible steps" to carry out "propaganda about the full and continued US aid" among the Chinese people, attempting to poison the national consciousness of the Chinese people and cover up the bloody crimes of the American bandits assisting Chiang Kai-shek in slaughtering the Chinese people. Fourth, based on the attempt to completely control the economy of the Chiang-controlled areas and to implement its "raw materials China" plan to enslave the Chinese people, the agreement requires the Chiang government to implement "effective production" and "grain collection," ordering the Chiang government to "make every possible effort" to engage in this "production" and "collection," and stipulates that the Chiang government must "provide US representatives with the most recent information on plans and progress toward achieving this goal." The agreement also strictly stipulates that "if any of the above provisions are not fulfilled, the US government may terminate any part or all of its relief assistance at any time." Since the agreement has already stipulated various privileges and conveniences for US imperialism to invade China, Chiang Kai-shek has further surrendered Chinese sovereignty, and US imperialism is happy to implement "relief" to Chiang Kai-shek "without (actually, no longer making) any request for compensation." According to Agence France-Presse Washington, the aid to the Kuomintang under this agreement will be $33 million.

    美蒋签订“救济协定”
    掩饰卖国侵华罪行
    【新华社陕北三十日电】蒋美“救济协定”已于二十七日在南京正式签订。协定内容充分暴露美帝国主义假“救济”名义援蒋内战和侵略中国之用心。协定系依照今年五月美国会通过之三亿五千万美元“对外救济法案”订立，而该“法案”之目的即在于援助各国反动派反对各国人民，以便利美国之侵略。协定规定救济物资得用以支持蒋匪为剥夺民间财富，供应其内战所实行之“物价管制”。救济物资之分配，规定经由商业途径，且规定由蒋政府及蒋美两方同意之所谓，“在华业已成立之志愿机构”代行办理，“救济物资”至出售所得之“钱带”则以蒋政府名义存入一特别帐户”，经美代表同意后即可开支，此皆显示此项“救济物资”得用于非“救济”目的。在这协定下美帝国主义获得如下特权：第一、协定反复规定美国对此项“救济”有“直接监督和管理之权”，为此美国政府将派遣庞大之“代表团”至中国。第二、此等美国代表有“在中国全境自由旅行”之权，蒋政府则必须“予以准许及便利”。自日本投降以来，美国曾不断谋取在中国全境搜集军事情报及探测中国经济资源之自由，上项规定，正为实行此项侵略步骤。第三、该协定且明白规定蒋匪应以“一切可行之步骤”在中国人民间进行“关于美国援助充分与继续之宣传”，妄图借此毒化中国人民的民族意识，与掩盖美国强盗援助蒋贼屠杀中国人民之血腥罪行。第四、基于由美国完全控制蒋区经济企图及为实行其奴役中国人民之“原料中国”计划，该协定要求蒋政府实行“有效之生产”及“粮食之征集”，命令蒋政府“尽一切可能之努力”从事此种“生产”与“征集”，并规定蒋政府必须以“对于达成此目的之计划与进度最近情报供给美国代表”。协定且严厉规定以上“任何条款未获履行时，美国政府得随时终止其救济援助之任何一部或全部。”由于协定业已规定给予美帝国主义各种特权及侵华便利，蒋介石已进一步断送中国主权，美国帝国主义遂乐于对蒋匪实行“救济”而“不作（实际是不再作）任何偿付之请求”。据法新社华盛顿消息，根据此次协定给予国民党之援助将为三千三百万美元。
