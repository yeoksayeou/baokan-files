　　Xinhua News Agency, East China, 23rd: A unit of the Jiaodong South Sea Military Sub-district local armed forces, cooperating with the Qingdao Ji(mo) East Two Armed Work Teams, wiped out the Chiang bandits on Wangcun Island, about 50 kilometers east of Jimo City, this month on the 14th. The entire enemy town team and two township teams were annihilated, capturing 413 enemy soldiers, killing and wounding 132, and seizing 87 rifles and 2 machine guns.

　　Xinhua News Agency, East China, 23rd: The people's guerrilla warfare in the Jiaodong Peninsula and along the Jiaoji Railway is being carried out extensively, constantly annihilating the enemy in coordination with the main forces, which has plunged the Chiang bandits who ventured into the area into a quagmire. After crushing the Chiang bandits' "encirclement and suppression" plan against the Kuangqi Mountain area and the Ai'gu Mountain area in late October and early this month, the Jiaodong local armed forces and militia, in coordination with the main forces, took advantage of the victory to advance into the enemy's heartland, cut off enemy transportation, and isolate enemy strongholds. The enemy in Laiyang can only rely on looting to satisfy their hunger within a few miles around the city. The Penglai People's Guerrilla Force is pressuring the enemy from the east, south, and west, forcing the retreat of the enemy strongholds in Miaoshan and Sanligou south of the city. The guerrilla forces in the four suburbs of Yantai have repeatedly repelled Chiang bandits who went out to rob food, inflicting casualties on the enemy. The enemy besieged in Cotton Mountain, northeast of Weihaiwei, has also been severely attacked every time they venture out. The Qingdao Armed Work Team is active in the periphery of Qingdao City and the suburbs of Jimo City. On October 12, they repelled four enemy battalions in the Lingshan area. The guerrilla forces along the Jiaoji Railway directly cooperate with the main forces in combat, compressing the enemy in the Weixian (County) southern area into the city and along the railway line, recovering more than 100 nearby villages. The local armed forces that penetrated deep into the enemy's rear south of Pingdu travel back and forth between Gaomi and Pingdu, attacking the enemy. On October 30, the Jimo local armed forces advanced southward to the Jiaoji Railway, eliminating the puppet organizations in more than 70 villages. On the 5th of this month, they again repelled the harassment of puppet bandits in Dongqibu area on the Yanqing Road. In the two battles, they captured more than 420 enemy soldiers and killed and wounded more than 80. The Lu Zhong Local Corps south of the railway, in order to coordinate the siege and annihilation of the Chiang bandits who penetrated deep into Jiaodong, launched an attack on the Zichuan Yidu border area in October, sweeping away all the Chiang puppets on the south side of the Jiaoji Railway in the area. After recovering Linqu, they once attacked Yidu City and the important towns of Xindian and Jinling on the Jiaoji Railway.

　　Xinhua News Agency, East China, 24th: Delayed news: The defense of Weihaiwei lasted for 36 days, annihilating more than 1,000 enemy soldiers. Having gloriously completed the established mission, on the morning of the 17th, our Weihai City garrison inflicted a heavy blow on the Chiang bandits, killing and wounding more than 300, and then proactively transferred.

　　Xinhua News Agency, East China, 24th: The third group of students of the East China Advanced Liberation Army Officer Corps (including 246 Chiang army general-level officers) held a graduation ceremony on October 28 and returned to their original residences.
