Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 24th. A light cavalry unit, active in the grasslands of Northern Chahar, after three months of heroic struggle, established a grassland guerrilla base area in the leased areas north of Kangbao, Tunxicheng Mandetang, and Zhengbai Banner and Xianghuang Banner. It has a population of over 10,000 and over a hundred villages and towns. In the fighting, our light cavalry destroyed eleven major puppet townships, including Wanxingdian, Danqinghe, and Jixiancun, and captured Habaga, a Mongolian-Han trading town. Wherever our army went, the masses rose up to join the army. Over six thousand poor peasants in twenty villages, including Longwangmiao, Qianhou Bantai, and Habaga, have launched a "counter-liquidation" movement, suppressing seven reactionary landlords, including Li Shusheng. A large amount of land, cattle, sheep, and movable property were liquidated. Currently, they are actively expanding the base area in coordination with our army.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 24th. Since September, the military and civilians in the liberated areas of Changping, Yanqing, Huailai, and Xuanhua, north of the Ping-Sui Railway, have captured twenty-seven important enemy strongholds along the Ping-Sui line, including Qianjiatai and Bailao, in the anti-"nibbling" struggle, posing a major threat to the Chiang bandit's Ping-Sui transportation. This autumn, the Chiang bandits planned to establish a blockhouse line with Nankou and Changping as bases, extending approximately one hundred li north to the Gaoliying line in northern Beiping, to maintain transportation on the Ping-Sui and Ping-Gu lines. Our local military and civilians immediately launched an anti-blockhouse construction struggle against the bandits, destroying over twenty newly built enemy blockhouses in Daxinfeng, Datangshan, Zhanggezhuang, and other places south of Changping, completely thwarting the enemy's blockhouse construction plan. A unit of our army took advantage of the situation to open up a large area in the enemy's rear south of Changping, carrying out land distribution struggles in villages near southern Beiping. The military and civilians in Huailai, Xuanhua, Xiahuayuan, and other places persisted in the anti-"enclosure" struggle, raiding Xiahuayuan and Zhaochuanpu, twenty li east of Xuanhua, in one fell swoop, liberating a large number of masses who had been "enclosed." The Xuanhua Armed Work Team also operated in the area twenty li from Zhangjiakou, greatly alarming the bandit Fu who was entrenched in Zhangjiakou.

　　察北建草原根据地
  　克贸易重镇哈巴嘎
  　平绥线克据点二十七处
    【新华社晋察冀二十四日电】活跃于察北大草原之我轻骑一部，经三月英勇奋斗，于康保、屯息城满德堂以北及正白旗、厢黄旗之租营地区建立草原游击根据地。拥有人口一万余，村镇百余处。战斗中我轻骑曾摧毁万兴店、丹清河、集贤村等伪大乡十一处，并攻占蒙汉贸易市镇哈巴嘎。我军所到之处，群众纷起参军，龙王庙、前后板台、哈巴嘎等二十余村六千余贫苦农民并已掀起反“倒算”运动，镇压了反动地主李树生等七人。清算出大批土地，牛羊和浮财。目前正配合我军积极扩展根据地中。
    【新华社晋察冀二十四日电】平绥路北侧昌平、延庆、怀来、宣化等地解放区军民自九月以来在反“蚕食”斗争中攻克平绥沿线前家台、白老等敌重要据点二十七处，使蒋匪平绥交通感受重大威胁。今秋蒋匪曾计划以南口、昌平为基点、向北平北约百里之高丽营一线建立碉堡封锁线，以维护平绥、平古两线交通，我当地军民即向匪展开反建碉斗争，于昌平南之大辛峰、大汤山、张各庄等地摧毁敌新建碉堡二十余处，敌建碉计划全告破产。我军一部更趁势于昌平南之敌后方开辟了大块地区，在北平南附近各村进行分田斗争。怀来、宣化、下花园等地军民则坚持反“人圈”斗争，一举袭入下花园及宣化东二十里之赵川堡，解放被“圈”走之大批群众。宣化武工队并活动于张垣二十里之地区，使盘踞张垣之傅匪大为之。
