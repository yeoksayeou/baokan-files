　　Read "Rural Survey" Postscript
　　Wèi Rán
　　Chairman Mao's book "Rural Survey" is the most important document for studying the Chinese land revolution. It has great guiding significance for our current land reform. This postscript was originally published in the Jin Sui Daily. The author's research on this book, starting from the Jin Sui land reform issues, can be used as a reference for our study and land reform.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　— Editor

　　With the great spirit of being a pupil of the masses, and using the Marxist-Leninist stance and methods, Chairman Mao personally collected extremely rich materials in the countryside from the Northern Expedition in 1927 until he left the Central Soviet Area in 1934, and wrote the book "Rural Survey". This book is a gospel for Chinese peasants; it is a key to guide us on how to serve the peasants with the Marxist-Leninist stance and methods.
　　The book records the materials of the land revolution in the Central Soviet Area. The first nine parts are from the early stage of the land revolution (of which the first part, "Xunwu Investigation," has been lost, leaving only eight parts), and the last two parts record the in-depth stage of the land revolution.
　　I have read this book in the past, but reading it today feels like reading it for the first time. This has a lot to do with my own understanding. Now I will write down some of my recent thoughts after reading it for the comrades to refer to. But I must declare that because I am very naive, my understanding is still extremely superficial, and there may even be errors. Please correct me without hesitation.
　　Equal distribution of land starts from eliminating the landlord class and all feudal exploitation, and solving the land, housing, farm tools, livestock, and rations problems of landless and land-poor peasants. The recently released "Letter to Peasants" has determined the four principles of thoroughly and equally distributing land and fairly and reasonably distributing all fruits: (1) Taking from the more and giving to the less; (2) Taking from the fertile and giving to the barren; (3) Using the administrative village as the unit of distribution; (4) Taking care of the degree of poverty. None of these four principles can be missing. Among them, the two principles of taking from the fertile and giving to the barren, and taking care of the degree of poverty are more important. The first three principles are mentioned in many places in "Rural Survey", but the last principle—taking care of the degree of poverty—although not explicitly stipulated during the Soviet land revolution period, after reading "Rural Survey", we have a very practical and profound understanding of the special importance of this principle. Here, I will first talk about this issue.
　　At the end of October 1930, Chairman Mao conducted a survey in Yongfeng District, the tenth district of Xingguo County, Jiangxi Province. He first observed eight families, and made extremely detailed and scientific investigations into the living conditions, production situation, and psychological state of poor peasants before and after the initial land revolution. When we look at the lives of poor peasants such as Fu Jiting and Li Changying, their figures and emotions vividly appear in our minds. This is the stance and method of basing all policies on the poor and lower-middle peasants. In the preface to the Xingguo investigation, Chairman Mao once told us: "Without this kind of investigation, there would be no basic concepts in the countryside." In the section "Old Land Relations in This District" of the same investigation, when talking about poor and hired peasants, Chairman Mao wrote: "...Poor peasants are very lacking in oxen power. Taking 100 poor families as an example, in this district, only 15 families have one ox each, 40 families share one ox between two families, 10 families share one ox between three families, 5 families share one ox between four families, and 30 families have no ox... Poor peasants can be divided into five classes according to the amount of oxen power." "Hired peasants and poor peasants were allocated land. ... Having been allocated land, they do not have oxen power or farm tools, and it is very difficult to cultivate. This problem has not yet been solved." "99% of hired peasants do not have wives, and they are the most miserable class in the countryside. Landlords and rich peasants not only have wives, but some have several wives. 90% of middle peasants have wives, and 10% do not. 70% of poor peasants have wives, and 30% do not... They dislike that the hired peasant's home does not have implements and utensils, and they also dislike that he is not often at home, so it is not easy for the hired peasant to solve the wife problem..." (This refers to the situation in the early stage of the land revolution - the author). From this, we can see that although "Rural Survey" does not put forward the principle of taking care of the degree of poverty, Chairman Mao's position and viewpoint of starting from the poor and hired peasants is extremely clear.
　　Regarding the issue of taking care of hired and poor peasants, this principle can be seen everywhere in "Rural Survey". I have only said a little bit above. Today, on the one hand, we must resolutely implement the principle of taking care of the degree of poverty stipulated in the "Letter to Peasants" issued by the Temporary Committee of the Border Region Peasants' Association; on the other hand, we should also seriously study "Rural Survey" to deeply understand the essence of this principle ideologically.
　　Secondly, in the section "Current Land Distribution Situation" in the Xingguo investigation, Chairman Mao detailed that in the early stage of the land revolution, dividing land by village (equivalent to our natural village here - the author) failed to meet the land requirements of the peasants, and in the issue of dividing green crops and renting out land, he pointed out the three malpractices of dividing land by village. In many places, he also detailed the process of dividing land by township (equivalent to administrative village - the author). In the part "Land Distribution Situation in Western Jiangxi", there is the following record: "The distant ones are ten li per township, and the township distributes evenly. The first distribution was in December last year (1929), the second distribution was in March this year, taking the original cultivation as the unit, taking from the more and giving to the less. Now the third distribution, taking from the fertile and giving to the barren..." In section 7 of the part "Dividing Green Crops and Renting Out Land", Chairman Mao pointed out in the correct method of "overall equal division of original cultivation": "In the past, taking the 'village' and 'family' as the unit and taking the original cultivation as the standard for equal division resulted in benefiting rich peasants and being unfavorable to poor peasants. The correct method should be: taking the township as the unit, according to the total population of the township, dividing the total number of people in the whole township (the total population of the whole township, those who originally cultivated in this township, and those who originally cultivated in other townships, combined) taking from the more and giving to the less, taking from the fertile and giving to the barren, moving the land if the land can be moved (villages with more land push a portion of the land to villages with less land), and moving the people if the land cannot be moved (too far away to move the land, so you can only move the people). This method is called 'overall distribution of original cultivation'." In the annotations added by Chairman Mao after the "Land Law" (made in December 1928, in Jinggang Mountain), he said: "...Regarding common cultivation and using labor as the standard for distributing land, it is announced that it will not be used as the main method, but private cultivation and using population as the standard for dividing land will be used as the main method. This is because although it was felt that the former was inappropriate at the time, there were many comrades who advocated it, so this was stipulated. Later, it was changed to only use the latter as the standard..." These records are of great guiding significance for our work today. At the same time, from these places, we realize how brilliant Chairman Mao's principles for solving the land problem of peasants are! If we further study the chapter "Errors in the Land Struggle in Jiangxi" recorded in "Rural Survey", we can further understand that in the land revolution, it is indeed a serious test to temper our position and viewpoint, and we realize the importance of working hard to study and understand Chairman Mao's thought!
　　"Rural Survey" not only provides us with rich historical knowledge of the land revolution struggle, but also gives us profound instructions on many major principle issues; moreover, Chairman Mao, with scientific investigation and analysis, tells us the class knowledge of the landlord class's cruel exploitation of the peasant class. In the second section "Old Land Relations in This District" of the Xingguo investigation, Chairman Mao conducted a thorough scientific investigation and analysis of the fact that landlords, feudal rich peasants occupied a large amount of land, as well as the horrible facts of rent exploitation, usury exploitation, tax exploitation, and so on. At the same time, in the section "Various Classes in the Struggle," he actually observed the reactionary essence of the landlord class and local bullies and rich peasants in the land revolution, awakening our confused concepts of unclear understanding of the landlord class. He also told us that the middle peasants gained both political and economic benefits in the land revolution, and thus were able to fight the landlords together with the poor and hired peasants through class analysis; in particular, using investigation and research, and a realistic approach, he explained the backbone role played by poor and hired peasants in the land revolution. It tells us the historical root cause of why hired peasants, the most oppressed and most resolute rural proletariat, did not hold power in the initial land revolution. This makes us more clearly and profoundly realize the importance of fully mobilizing the hired and poor peasants in today's equal distribution of land, so that they can play a leading backbone role in the struggle. Secondly, he also investigated and studied handicraft workers, small merchants, and peddlers, giving us a method to understand various strata in the countryside. All of these, we should seriously study and understand, and study with our hearts, so as to better and more correctly serve the masses.
　　Finally, the book gives us two most important inspirations in "Errors in the Land Struggle in Jiangxi". One is recorded: at that time, 80% of the Party in Ruijin were landlords and rich peasants. In Shangyou (place name), there were more than 80 Party members, and more than 30 of them were landlords and rich peasants, including the head of the guard regiment (then a KMT spy). They mixed into the Party and sabotaged the land revolution, and did not divide the land for two months. We should keep these inspirations in mind! Second, from this section, we are awakened that if cadres have an unclear understanding of the Party's policies and an unstable position, they will make political principle errors in their work. Therefore, humble and sincere learning is extremely urgent! Also, in the last two parts of this book: "Changgang Township Investigation" and "Caixi Township Investigation", they also give us important inspirations on building a new society during and after the equal distribution of land, especially in implementing the mass line, opposing bureaucracy, and absorbing mass creation and timely promotion, which should also attract our great attention. We should understand them well, so that we can earnestly and practically practice and train ourselves in our work.

　　读“农村调查”后记
    蔚然
    毛主席著“农村调查”一书，是研究中国土地革命问题最重要的文献，对于我们今天的土地改革，有着极大的指导意义。这篇读后记，原载晋绥日报，作者从晋绥土改问题出发对此书所作的研究，可供我们学习及进行土改中的参考。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——编者    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    毛主席以甘当群众小学生的伟大精神，用马列主义的立场方法，自一九二七年北伐战争起，至一九三四年离开中央苏区为止，亲手在农村中搜集了极丰富的材料，写成“农村调查”一书。这本书是中国农民的一本福音书；是指导我们如何用马列主义的立场方法为农民服务的一把锁。
    这本书里所记载的，都是中央苏区土地革命的材料，前九部分是土地革命初期的（其中第一部分“寻邬调查”已遗失，只留下八部分），后两部分是记土地革命深入后的。
    过去我也读过这本书，但在今天读起来，好象没有读过的一样，这和自己的理解力大有关系，现在将我最近读后的一点感想写出来，供同志们参考；但必须声明：因自己十分幼稚，还领会得极其肤浅，甚至可能有错误，请同志们不吝指正。
    平分土地，是从消灭地主阶级和一切封建剥削，解决无地少地农民的土地、房屋、农具、牲畜、口粮出发的。在最近发布的“告农民书”里面，已经确定：要彻底平分土地，和公平合理分配一切果实的四条原则：（一）抽多补少；（二）抽肥补瘦；（三）按行政村为分配单位；（四）照顾贫苦程度。这四个原则，一条也不能缺少。当中抽肥补瘦、照顾贫苦程度两个原则更为重要。前三个原则在“农村调查”里面，很多处都提到了，后一个原则——照顾贫苦程度一条，虽然在苏维埃土地革命时期，没有明确规定出来，但是在读了“农村调查”之后，却使我们对这一原则的特别重要有了非常实际与深刻的理解。这里首先谈谈这个问题。
    毛主席于一九三○年十月底，在江西兴国县第十区——永丰区作了一个调查，他首先作了八个家庭的观察，把贫苦农民的土地革命前和初期土地革命后的生活状况，生产情形和心理状况，作了极详尽与科学的调查。当我们看了傅济庭、李昌英等贫苦农民的生活，他们的身影情感，就活现于我们的头脑，这就是一切政策从贫雇农出发的立场和方法。毛主席在兴国调查的篇首里，曾经告诉我们说：“没有这种调查，就没有农村中的基础概念。”在同一调查“本区旧有土地关系”一节里面，说到贫雇农的时候，毛主席写道：“……贫农的牛力是很缺乏的，以贫农百家论，本区每家一个牛的只有十五家，两家共一牛的四十家，三家共一牛的十家，四家共一牛的五家，无牛的三十家……，贫农可以依照牛力多少，分为五个阶层。”“雇农和贫农一样分了田。……分了田，牛力农具没有，又很难耕种，此问题现在尚未解决。”“雇农没有老婆的占百分之九十九，是农村中最苦的一个阶级。地主富农不但人人有老婆，一人几个老婆的也有。中农百分之九十有老婆，百分之十没有。贫农百分之七十有老婆，百分之三十没有；……嫌雇农家中没有器具用品，又嫌他不常在家中，所以雇农不容易解决老婆问题……。”（这是指土地革命初期的情形——笔者）从这里我们可以看出“农村调查”里面，虽无提出照顾贫苦程度一条原则，但毛主席从贫雇农出发的立场观点，极为明确。
    关于照顾雇贫农问题，在“农村调查”中，随处可以窥见这种原则精神，我上面只说了一点点；今天我们一面要坚决执行边区农会临时委员会“告农民书”中所规定的照顾贫苦程度这条原则；一面还应认真学习“农村调查”，从思想上深刻理解这个原则的要义。
    其次，毛主席在兴国调查“现在土地分配状况”一节里，详载着土地革命初期，以村（相当于我们这里的自然村——笔者）为单位分田，未能满足农民土地要求，和在分青出租问题里，指出了以村为单位分田的三种弊病。在好多处，又详载了以乡为单位（相当于行政村——笔者）的分田经过；在“赣西土地分配情形”一部分中，有这样一段记载：“远的十里一乡，一乡好歹搭匀分。去年（一九二九）十二月分第一次，本年三月分第二次，以原耕为单位，抽多补少。现在分第三次，抽肥补瘦，……”在“分青与出租问题”一部分第七节里，毛主席指出：“原耕总合平分”的正确办法里面写道：“过去以‘村’以‘家’为单位照原耕为标准去平分，结果有利富农不利贫农。正当的办法应该是：以乡为单位，按乡人口总数，除全乡人口原来的总数（全乡人口，原来在本乡耕的，和原来在外乡耕的，和原来在外乡耕的，合计起来）抽多补少，抽肥补瘦，移得田动的移田（田多的村，把田推一部分给与田少的村）移田不动的移民（隔远了，无法移田，只好移民）。这个办法，叫做‘原耕总合分配’”。在“土地法”（一九二八年十二月制，在井冈山）后面，毛主席加的按语中说道：“……关于共同耕种与以劳动力为分配土地标准，宣布不作为主要办法，而以私人耕种与以人口为分田标准作为主要办法，这是因为当时虽感到前者不妥，而同志中主张者不少，所以这样规定，后来就改为只以后者为标准了……。”这些记载，对于我们今天的工作，均有极大的指导意义，同时从这些地方，我们领会到毛主席对于解决农民土地问题的原则，何等英明！如果我们再研究一下“农村调查”里所载“江西土地斗争中的错误”一章，就更加可以了解在土地革命当中，实为锻炼我们立场观点的严重考验，而且体会到努力学习，领会毛主席思想之重要了！
    “农村调查”，不仅给予我们以丰富的土地革命斗争历史知识，对于许多重大的原则问题，也给了我们以深刻的指示；而且毛主席以科学的调查分析，告诉了我们地主阶级对农民阶级残酷剥削的阶级知识，在兴国调查第二节“本区旧有土地关系”里面，毛主席把地主封建富农占有大量土地，以及对地租剥削，高利贷剥削，捐税剥削等等惨绝人寰的事实，作了周密的科学的调查分析。同时在“斗争中的各阶级”一节里面，他实际的观察了地主阶级、恶霸富农，在土地革命当中的反动本质，惊醒了我们对地主阶级认识不清的糊涂观念。还告诉了我们中农在土地革命当中，在政治上、经济上都得到好处，因而能同贫雇农一道斗争地主的阶级分析；特别用调查研究，实事求是的方法，说明贫农雇农在土地革命当中所起的骨干作用。告诉了我们雇农这一最受压迫革命最坚决的农村无产阶级，在初期土地革命当中，没有当权的历史根源。这就使我们更加明确而深刻的认识了在今天平分土地当中，充分发动雇贫农，使他们在斗争中起领导骨干的重要性。其次对于手工工人、小商、小贩都作了调查研究，给了我们了解农村中各个阶层的方法。所有这些，我们应该认真钻研与领会，用心学习，以便更好的更正确的为群众办事。
    最后，本书在“江西土地斗争的错误”里面，给我们两条最重要的启示，一条载着：当时瑞金的党有百分之八十是地主富农。上犹（地名）党员八十多人，地主富农占三十多人，内有警卫团总（当时蒋特），他们混进党内，破坏土地革命，两个月不分田。这些启示，我们应悟寐在心！二是从这一节里面，惊醒我们，干部对党的政策认识不清和立场不稳，是会在工作中犯政治原则性的错误的。因此，虚心诚恳的学习，万分迫切！又本书之最后两部分中：“长冈乡调查”与“才溪乡调查”，对平分土地当中和以后建设新社会上，也给我以重要启示，特别是在贯澈群众路线，反对官僚主义，及吸收群众创造及时推广等等，同样应该引起我们极大的注意，好好领会，以便在我们工作中，认真切实的去实践和锻炼。
