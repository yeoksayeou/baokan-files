(Jinan, Hebei, November 2nd) In Huazhuang Village, Yuanchao Seventh District, with 168 households, the village cadres are all poor peasants and are very enthusiastic about leading production. Last year, all four lumber mills in the village were controlled by poor peasants. For example, Wang Ruyi, a representative of the Farmers' Association, led 14 poor peasant households. Wang Guangwei and two others led a total of 19 households. In addition, there were three steamed bun shops, with a total of three households; two noodle shops, with four households; one oil press, with 20 households; and one confectionery store, with two households. The remaining 15 households were engaged in petty trading. A total of 77 households were engaged in business, accounting for 46 percent of the original households. Due to the profitability of the businesses and the efforts of the village cadres, the number expanded by another 32 households, with 95 percent of the households participating in flour milling. After the wheat harvest, eight mutual aid teams earned a total of 9.5 million yuan in dividends, and 20 households engaged in petty trading also earned 300,000 yuan. The entire village is now working hard to develop side businesses.

In Beixiaozhang Village, in the same district, with 93 households, including five landlord households and nine rich peasant households, although several struggles have taken place, the feudal forces have not been completely defeated, and the economic power is still in the hands of the landlords. For example, the doctor, accountant, and medicine-grinding workers in the village cooperative (medicine cooperative) were all from households that had been struggled against. The people of the village are good at doing business, with one-half originally engaged in business. People from other villages say, "The people of Beixiaozhang are all shrewd businessmen." Last spring, when the higher authorities proposed organizing mutual aid teams for side businesses, landlords and bad elements seized the opportunity to infiltrate. For example, all three lumber mills were manipulated by landlords. The landlord Wang Sibang became the team leader, while only nine poor peasants became team members. The landlord Han Denggui also became a team leader, and the landlord's henchman, Wang Wenshu, also manipulated a mutual aid team of 12 households. Another henchman, Wang Yuguang, controlled a six-household cotton ginning team. In the entire village, 47 households engaged in business were all manipulated by landlords. They stole money and sabotaged the teams, and spread the rumor that the side businesses were too burdensome, causing the side business mutual aid to collapse completely.

    元朝两个村的副业
    贫农领导搞得好
    地主操纵垮了台
    【本报冀南二日电】元朝七区化庄，一百六十八户，村干全是贫农，对领导生产上很是带劲。去年全村一共四个木料厂，全掌握在贫农手里。如农会代表王如意领导的有十四户贫农。王广维等三人领导的共有十九户。另外还有三个馒头坊，共三户。两个挂面坊，是四户。一个油坊，二十户。一个果子铺，两户。其余还有十五户做小买卖的，共做买卖的是七十七户，占原户的百分之四十六。由于买卖赚钱和村干的努力，又扩大了三十二户，有百分之九十五的户都参加了磨粉。麦后八个互助组共得红利九十五万元，二十户小买卖也赚了三十万元。现全村都正努力搞副业。该区北小丈村九十三户，地主五户，富农九户，虽经过几次斗争，但封建势力仍没有彻底打垮，经济大权仍在地主手里掌握着。如该村合作社（药社）先生、会计、拉药斗的都是被斗户。该村的人都善于做买卖，原做买卖的有二分之一。外村的人都说：“北小丈的人都是买卖精。”去年春天上级提出了组织副业互助组，地主坏分子就乘机钻进来。如三个木料厂都叫地主操纵着。地主王思帮当了组长，相反的九户贫民当组员。地主韩登贵也当了组长，地主狗腿子王文树也操纵着十二户的互助组。还有狗腿王玉广掌握着一个六户洋弓组。全村共做买卖四十七户，都被地主操纵着。他们在组内偷钱破坏，并散布副业负担重的空气，把副业互助全给弄垮了。
