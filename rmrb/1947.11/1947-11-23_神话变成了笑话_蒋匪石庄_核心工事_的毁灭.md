　　Mythology Turned Joke
  　The Destruction of Chiang Kai-shek's Stone Village "Core工事"
    【Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji Frontline, 21st】Our correspondent Yang Shuo reported on breaking through a corner of Chiang Kai-shek's core fortifications in Shijiazhuang, stating: The last and strongest defense line of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in Shijiazhuang—the so-called "core fortifications"—was built in the city center, using solid buildings such as the railway station, the Big Stone Bridge, and the Zhengtai Hotel as its main body. It was surrounded by trenches, gun holes, foxholes, hidden bunkers, and high碉楼(watchtowers), scattered like stars. Most were made of steel and reinforced concrete, equipped with light and heavy machine guns, and surrounded by electric fences, layered upon layered, interwoven into a tight fire net. The bandits thought they had a dangerous place to defend, so they made up the myth of "impregnability." On the 8th, bandit division commander Liu Ying even plucked up his courage and broadcast to the whole city, saying: "We should use the existing strong fortifications, wait for work at leisure, and eliminate the enemy in front of the position." However, the People's Liberation Army used its troops with lightning speed, capturing the inner and outer city moats in three days, killing the enemy so that they lost their souls. The remnants fled from all directions into the "core工事," which became turtles in a jar, easier to catch.
    At dusk on the 11th, our mighty troops surrounded the remnants led by bandit division commander Liu Ying like iron tongs, concentrating artillery fire for a fierce bombardment, lightning and thunder, with amazing power. The enemy used an armored train on the railway in front of the station to cover the infantry with gunfire to counterattack us. We concentrated machine guns to shoot head-on. The armored train fled in a hurry, leaving the infantry to drill around everywhere. The train, the warehouse, and the bunker became places to escape. Jiang Huancheng, the leader of the 9th squad of a certain unit, led five people, quickly crossed the railway, and approached a bunker, scaring the inside to shout: "We won't fight anymore!" They threw a large pile of guns out of the bunker.
    At this time, another enemy armored train was still driving back and forth, blocking our army's offensive route. Our soldiers immediately set up rocket launchers and anti-tank guns, firing nine rounds in a row. The enemies on the train were shocked and fainted. Before they could wake up, the soldiers swarmed up. The enemies raised their hands and jumped off the car as prisoners. At this time, our army had poured over the railway and rushed straight to the station. Near midnight, Zhang Yin, the deputy company commander of the 6th company of a certain unit, with dozens of people, went straight to the water tower. Although the tower was equipped with light and heavy machine guns, the building was very strong, but the victory in the battle of Qingfengdian had long frightened the enemy, and their morale was low. No matter how strong the工事 were, they were nothing more than empty shells lacking life. A row of grenades was thrown over, and the tower was occupied with one charge. Only the sound of gunfire was heard in the southwest. Our 6th company rushed over, but the enemy had already run away. Looking under the starlight, it was a large dark area, with dozens of cars, four tanks, and two howitzers. The soldiers counted them all. At dawn, our armies, with the spirit of counter-offensive, quickly seized the main positions, and bandit division commander Liu Ying had been captured. The remnants squeezed to the upstairs of the Zhengtai Hotel, and were finally wiped out by us at noon. And the myth of "the core工事 is impregnable" has become a joke.

　　神话变成了笑话
  　蒋匪石庄“核心工事”的毁灭
    【新华社晋察冀前线廿一日电】本社记者杨朔报导突破石庄蒋匪核心工事的一角称：石家庄蒋匪最后最坚的防线——所谓“核心工事”，修在市中心，以火车站、大石桥及正太饭店等坚固建筑做主体，周围遍挖壕沟、枪眼、伏地堡、暗堡、高碉，星罗棋布，多是钢骨水泥修成，里面配着轻重机枪，外面围着电网，层层叠叠，交织成严密的火网。匪徒们以为有险可守，就编出“不可攻破”的神话。八日，匪师长刘英还壮着胆子向全市广播说：“我们应利用既设之强固工事，以逸待劳，消灭敌于阵地前。”但解放军用兵神速，三日内连夺里外两道市沟，杀得敌人失魂落魄，残兵败将从四面八方逃进“核心工事”，却正好变成瓮中之龟，更易捕捉。
    十一日黄昏，我各路雄兵象铁箝一样，把匪师长刘英所率残部紧紧围住，集中炮火猛烈轰击，电闪雷鸣，威力惊人。敌用一列铁甲车在车站前之铁道上往来以枪炮掩护步兵向我反扑，我集中机枪迎头射击，铁甲列车怆惶逃走，撇下步兵到处乱钻，火车里、仓库里、地堡里都成了逃命的去处。我某部九班长蒋焕成领着五人，飞步越过铁路，迫近一地堡，吓得里边乱叫：“俺们不打了！”就从地堡内丢出一大堆枪。
    这时，敌又一铁甲车仍来往行驶，挡住我军进攻道路，我战士即架起火箭炮、反坦克炮，连打九发，车上的敌人震昏了，不等清醒，战士们就一拥而上，敌人高举双手，纷纷跳下车来作了俘虏。此时，我军已涌过铁道，直扑车站。时近半夜，某部六连副连长张银占领着几十人，又直奔水塔，塔上虽设有轻重机枪，建筑十分牢固，但清风店一战早使敌人闻风丧胆，士气颓丧。工事再坚，无非是缺乏生命的空壳。一排手榴弹扔过去，一个冲锋就将该塔占领了。只听西南还有枪声，我军六连紧奔过去，敌人却早跑得无影了。在星光下一看，黑黝黝的一大片，内有几十辆汽车，四辆坦克，两门加农炮，战士们就照数点收了。天明，我各路大军带着反攻的锐气，迅速地夺得各主要阵地，匪师长刘英已就擒。残敌挤到正太饭店楼上，终于在正午被我一网打尽。而“核心工事不可攻破”的神话，就变成笑话了。
