    Shexian County Mobilized Poor and Hired Peasants
    Only Then Was the Wheat Field Area Universally Expanded
    When Shexian County mobilized the masses to rush-plant wheat on a large scale, some districts grabbed hold of the poor and hired peasants in their initial efforts, and the movement quickly gained momentum. For example, in District One, Qu Jun started by focusing on the poor and hired peasants to calculate accounts and determine appropriate planting times. This year, there was less early autumn harvest and more late autumn harvest. If wheat wasn't rush-planted, it wouldn't be sown before the frost. Old man Song Shenxiu said, "I've rush-planted before. It's better to plant early than late. If it's too late, the soil won't be loose, and if there are crops above and the weather turns cold, the late planting will be suppressed and won't work." When the leadership adopted the opinions of the poor and hired peasants, 98 mu of wheat were rush-planted the next day. In District Five, after the poor and hired peasants of Pingshang reached a consensus, they led the way in initiating a major discussion on rush-planting wheat, widely recalling historical experiences. For example, poor peasant Geng Fanlong said, "Early silkworms and early wheat are better when rush-planted compared to late planting. The wheat I rush-planted in 1920 gave a good harvest in 1921." Chang Zhende said, "The wheat I rush-planted in 1929 yielded three dou, while the later plantings only yielded one dou." Breaking through confused thinking, they launched the rush-planting movement. Under the active leadership of the poor and hired peasants, 432 mu of wheat were rush-planted in five days. In Taizhuang, District Seven, 34 sickles, 29 shovels, and 280 jin of wheat seeds were allocated to poor and hired peasants to solve their difficulties in planting wheat, thus promoting the movement. Conversely, some leaders who did not grasp the key of mobilizing the poor and hired peasants failed to develop the movement, and couldn't push it forward. For example, in District Two, they only one-sidedly focused on paddy fields and abandoned the leadership of rush-planting in mountain gully drylands. In the Baiquan area, until the frost arrived, the masses were still waiting to harvest the late autumn crops before plowing and sowing. In some villages, the movement could not be carried out, and backward elements were squeezed out of mutual aid groups, left aside, and the movement stagnated.
    The county leadership studied the situation at the time and, after holding separate meetings, the responsible comrades of each district shifted their focus to leading production. Most districts held district cadre meetings, and some convened key point group leader meetings, changing their leadership methods from top to bottom. For example, after the meeting in District Two, the leadership first changed its leadership perspective and concentrated its efforts on the mountain village drylands, launching an inspection to break through the movement. In District Eight, the Donglutou key point went deep among the poor and hired peasants to inspect and solve their difficulties in planting wheat. After inspection, District Seven expanded by 1,273 mu, and District Three's Tongguang expanded from 75 percent to 85 percent. In general, throughout the county, after mobilizing the poor and hired peasants, the wheat field area was universally expanded. (Xu Yuancun, Jia Lin)

    涉县发动了贫雇
    才普遍扩大麦田
    涉县发动群众大量串麦时，有的区下去第一炮就抓住了贫雇，运动就迅速轰开。如一区曲峻，着手就以贫雇为主进行了算帐节令等，今年直秋少晚秋多，如不串麦，到霜降也种不上。宋甚修老汉说：“我过去串过，宜直不宜晚，迟了地不虚，上边再有庄稼气候又冷，压着迟了不行。”当领导上采纳了贫雇意见，第二天就串麦九十八亩。五区平上贫雇思想通后，以贫雇为首开展了串麦大酝酿，普遍回忆了历史串麦经验，如贫雇耿凡隆说：“早蚕直麦还是早串比迟了种强。民国九年上我串的麦子，十年上好收成。”常振德说：“我十八年串的麦子打三斗，后种的打斗把”。打破了糊涂思想开展了串麦运动。在贫雇的积极带领下，五天串麦四百三十二亩。七区台庄给贫雇调剂买镰卅四张，锨二十九张，麦种二百八十斤，解决了贫雇种麦困难推开了运动。相反有些领导上没有掌握了发动贫雇的关键，运动开展不开，推也推不动。如二区只偏面的重视了水地，放弃了山沟旱地串麦的领导，在白泉水一带到下霜时，群众还等着割了晚秋犁种，有部分村庄运动开展不了，就在互助里挤落后，没掌握住发动贫雇关键。相反把落后的贫雇都挤出了组去，扔在了一旁，运动停滞突不开。
    县领导根据当时情况作了研究，经分头开会以后，各区的负责同志，才将重点放到了领导生产上来，大部区都抓住开了区干部会议，有的召开了基点组长会议，由上到下的改换了领导方法。如二区会后，领导上首先改换了领导观点，集中力量到了山庄旱地去，开展检查突开运动。八区以东鹿头基点，深入贫雇检查解决贫雇种麦困难。七区检查后扩大一千二百七十三亩，三区童广由百分之七十五，扩到百分之八十五。总的在全县经过发动贫雇，普遍的扩大了麦田。（徐元存、贾林）
