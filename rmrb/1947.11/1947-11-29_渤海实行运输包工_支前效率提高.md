Xinhua News Agency, East China, 24th—Since the Bohai area implemented the support-the-front transport contracting system, according to preliminary experience in Bin County, Lijin County, and Huimin County, the results are good. 1. It has greatly eliminated the waste of manpower and materials. In the past, the stationing department often controlled 1,500 carts, and the consumption of materials was huge, and a large number of laborers could not carry out production. For example, in the Zhangchangdian station in August and September, 220 carts were often controlled, but in these two months, only 79 carts served once. 2. It has greatly improved transportation efficiency. When the contracted transportation task arrives, it is assembled on the spot, and the distance, weight, and importance of the transportation are explained. The more you load, the farther you go, and the more wages you get, which completely meets the needs of the masses and improves enthusiasm. Therefore, in the past, a cart loaded 500 to 700 catties, but now it has increased to 1,000 to 1,500 catties. The journey that used to take four days to travel back and forth now only takes three days. When departing, the civilians automatically divide the work and discuss the route, calculate the distance, and calculate the time for loading and unloading, eating, and drinking water. Once, when transporting 4,300 catties of materials, it was estimated that five carts would be needed according to the general load capacity, but the civilians transported them with three carts. In the implementation of the contracting system, the following problems have been discovered that must be solved: (1) It should be combined with meritorious service in supporting the front to avoid the simple economic views of the masses caused by simple wages and remuneration. (2) Before assigning tasks, it is necessary to clarify the location, route, mileage, and the type and quantity of materials, and correctly agree on the location, time, and person in charge of the contact, so as to avoid the contracted transportation team running blindly and wasting time. (3) The contracted transportation team should be universally organized; otherwise, the materials here will be transported by the contracted transportation team there, which will waste time, manpower, and materials. (4) It is necessary to deeply understand the organization of labor and tools and the distribution of wages, and strive for fairness and rationality.

　　渤海实行运输包工
  　支前效率提高
    【新华社华东二十四日电】渤海区实施支前运输包工制后，据滨县、利津、惠民等县初步经验，效果良好。一、大大杜绝了人力物力的浪费。过去兵站部经常掌握有一千五百辆大车，物力消费浩大，大批劳动力不能进行生产，如张常店一个站在八、九两月份，经常控制二百二十辆大车，但在这两个月中，只有七十九辆大车服务一次。二、大大提高了运输效率，包运任务一到临时就地集合，讲明运送远近轻重，越装得多，越走的远，越拿的工资多，完全适合群众要求，积极性提高。因此过去一辆车装五百斤至七百斤，现增到一千斤至一千五百斤，过去四天来回的路程，现三天即够了。出发时民工自动的分工讨论路线，计算路程，装货卸货吃饭喝水都计算时间。某次运送四千三百斤物资，按照一般载重量估计需用五辆大车，民工们用三辆就运走了。在实行包运制时，现已发觉有如下几个问题必须解决：（一）要与支前立功相结合，以免单纯的从工资报酬引起群众单纯的经济观点。（二）交代任务前，一定要把地点、路线、里程以及物资的种类数量弄清楚，并且正确约定接头的地点时间和负责人，以免包运队跑瞎路，耽误时间。（三）包运队要普遍组织，否则这里的物资要那里的包运队来运，耽误时间，浪费人力物力。（四）要深入了解劳动力与工具的组织和工资的分配，务求公平合理。
