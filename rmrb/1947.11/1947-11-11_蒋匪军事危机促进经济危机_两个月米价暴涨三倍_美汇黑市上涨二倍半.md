Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th. Comprehensive reports indicate that the price fluctuations in the Chiang-controlled areas since mid-August represent the fourth price surge this year, following the "February price surge," "April price surge," and "June price surge." On August 17th, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits issued new foreign exchange regulations, devaluing the Chiang currency by more than threefold. On August 18th, prices broke through the temporary stability that had lasted for more than a month since early July and rose sharply. Initially, it was export goods, followed by imported goods and domestic products and grains, all of which followed suit. Within three days, the prices of tung oil and tea in Shanghai rose by nearly 50%. Among imported goods, gasoline more than doubled in price within three days. From late August to September 21st, prices soared again, especially for rice, cotton, yarn, and US dollars. By September 22nd, rumors spread that the Chiang government would issue 50,000 yuan banknotes, and prices rose wildly for the third time. Only in late October, when the Chiang government frantically implemented terror and suppression, did the price surge show a slight pause. In total, it lasted for more than two months, longer than the previous three price surges this year. In addition, the speed of the increase was unprecedented. Taking rice prices as an example, the highest price reached 900,000 yuan per dan in mid-October, almost tripling in two months since August 17th. During the rice riots in the April price surge, it took one and a half months to increase by less than one and a half times. The black market price of US dollars rose by more than two and a half times in two months. From the gold rush in February to the end of June this year, it only increased by three times in nearly five months.

Although this price surge was directly caused by the new foreign exchange measures, its fundamental cause was the vicious inflation caused by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits engaging in the anti-people civil war. According to the "American Correspondence" quoted by experts in the Shanghai World Knowledge, Volume 16, Issue 3, published last month, the total financial expenditure of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits this year will require a total of 2 billion US dollars, which, even when converted at the official exchange rate, is more than 100 trillion Chiang currency. According to the estimate made by Yu Hongjun, the finance minister of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, the Chiang government's possible income this year is at most 17 trillion yuan, which means that more than 83% of the total expenditure, or more than 83 trillion yuan, relies on issuing banknotes to make up for it. This vicious inflation is still developing.

Secondly, the Chiang government's anti-people civil war military crisis is most clearly manifested in the market this time. The price surge suddenly soared again in early October. According to various reports, this was mainly due to the pessimistic sentiment in the market regarding the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' political and economic future and military situation. Zhang Qun, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's prime minister, also admitted at the Resident Committee of the Senate on October 18th that "the main reason for the sharp rise in prices is inflation, and the worrying military situation is also one of the reasons." Due to the failure of his civil war and the further shaking of people's hearts, the credit of the Chiang currency was almost completely lost. When prices soared wildly in mid-October, Shanghai became a dumping ground for the Chiang currency. Anyone with surplus Chiang currency rushed to sell it in exchange for goods with fixed value. In the Hankou market, transactions were simply conducted openly in silver dollars.

### 蒋匪军事危机促进经济危机　两个月米价暴涨三倍  美汇黑市上涨二倍半

　　蒋匪军事危机促进经济危机
  　两个月米价暴涨三倍
    美汇黑市上涨二倍半
    【新华社陕北九日电】综合报导，蒋管区自八月中起的物价波动，为继“二月涨风”，“四月涨风”，及“六月涨风”后之今年内第四次物价涨风。八月十七日蒋匪颁布的外汇新条例，将蒋币贬低三倍以上，十八日物价即冲破七月初起之一个多月的暂时稳定，而大涨起来。开始是出口货，继而进口货及国内土产及粮食亦均跟随上涨。三天以内，上海桐油茶叶价格上涨几达百分之五十，进口货中之汽油三日内即上涨二倍以上。八月低至九月廿一日，各物又再度狂涨，尤以米、花、纱布、及美汇价格为最烈。至九月二十二日，盛传蒋政府将发行五万元大钞，百物又第三度狂涨不已。直至十月下旬，蒋政府疯狂实行恐怖镇压，物价涨风才稍呈停止。前后为时共二月有余，波动时间之长为今年已往三次涨风所不及。此外，上涨速度亦为前所未有。以米价为例，至十月中旬最高价格每担达九十万元，自八月十七日起两月之内几乎激增三倍，四月涨风米骚动期间一个半月才上涨不到一倍半。美汇黑市价格两月中上涨二倍半以上，自今年二月黄金潮至六月底，将近五个月只不过上涨三倍。
    此次涨风虽由外汇新办法直接引起，但其基本原因则是蒋匪从事反人民内战所造成的恶性通货膨胀。据月前出版的上海世界知识十六卷第三期载“美国通讯”引述专家的估计，今年蒋匪财政总支出共需二十亿元美金，即按官定外汇牌价折合，亦在蒋币一百万亿元以上。又据蒋匪财政部长俞鸿钧所作估计，今年蒋政府可能得到之收入至多为十七万亿元，则总开支中有百分之八十三以上，即八十三万亿元以上，系依靠发钞弥补。这种恶性的通货膨胀还在继续发展。
    其次，蒋政府反人民内战军事危机表现于市场上，亦以此次最为明显。涨风发展至十月初突再度飞跃上升，据各方报导主要即由于蒋匪政治经济前途及军事局势之悲观情绪弥漫市场所致蒋匪行政院长张群于十月十八日在参政会驻委会上也承认：“物价猛涨之主因为通货膨胀，而军事局势之令人不安亦原因之一”。由于其内战军事之失败及人心之更加动摇，蒋币之信用几完全丧失。当十月中旬百物狂涨时，上海成了蒋币之倾销地，每一有剩余蒋币的人，均争先出脱以换取有固定价值之货物。汉口市场上简直公开以现洋进行交易。
