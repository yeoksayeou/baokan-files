　　Several Questions Regarding "Land Mutual Aid"

Editor:
    We have read the experiment on land mutual aid in Gengneng Village, Jincheng, published on page two of the November 3rd edition, several times. We all think that many aspects are similar to the land-for-shares method in Donggou Village, but there are several issues that are still unclear, preventing us from studying it in more detail. In order to understand the issues more specifically and facilitate mutual learning, we are raising the areas we are unsure about and request answers to facilitate our research and learning.
    1.  It is very good to distribute the part exceeding the yield according to work points, but should the amount of labor used per household's land also be evaluated in advance? What is the basis for calculating whether the whole village has a full or short output?
    2.  Livestock is pooled and used by the public. Does the livestock owner receive wages? (Or is it considered as offsetting work?) In addition, livestock varies in speed. Everyone wants to use the good and fast ones. If the livestock user doesn’t own the animal, they will want the animal to work harder. For example, when pulling a millstone, they will want to grind faster. Also, if Zhang San contributes a mule to the group, but when he needs it, the mule is unavailable and he is given a donkey instead, will he be dissatisfied? Furthermore, what happens if the livestock dies halfway through? Does the individual owner still receive dividends?
    3.  Accumulated manure is also used as shares to distribute sideline dividends. However, some households have more manure and some have less, meaning the shares are different. The dividends are, of course, distributed according to the number of shares. However, the fertilizer (i.e., capital) is gone once it is applied to the land. How will this fertilizer (capital) be calculated in the future? Will dividends still be distributed next year for this year's accumulated manure?
    4.  Livestock and fertilizer both share in sideline dividends. If the sideline doesn't make money or makes very little, what will happen? Also, if there are no dividends from agricultural income, or before the assessed yield is reached, the livestock will not be able to receive dividends. (Shahe Office)

Editor's Note: The practices in Shahe Donggou and Jincheng Gengneng are both attempts to further improve mutual aid production based on local conditions. Since conditions vary from place to place, forced adoption is not advisable. However, in order to exchange experiences and improve this practice, we hope that readers, especially those in charge of production, will raise any opinions or questions at any time. Please have the Taiyue Branch answer the questions raised by the Shahe Office based on the specific circumstances, and we hope to continue reporting on the progress of the experiment.

### 关于“土地互助”的几点疑问

1947-11-20
第2版()
专栏：读者来问

　　关于“土地互助”的几点疑问编者同志：
    十一月三日二版所登晋城庚能村土地互助的实验。我们几个人看了好几遍，都认为很多地方和东沟村的土地入股办法差不多，但有几个问题还闹不清楚，不能更祥细的研究，为了能够更具体的了解问题和互相学习起见，特把我们搞不清的地方提出来，请答复，以便我们研究和学习。
    一、超过产量的部分按工分红是很好，但是每户土地用工多少，是否在事先也要评议呢？全村满打满算，长得短出是依据什么计算呢？
    二、牲口集股归了公家使用，牲口主得工资不得？（或顶工不顶工？）另外是牲口有快有慢，谁也想用好的和快的，用牲口户如果不是自己的，都要让牲口多出力哩，如拉碾磨，能打快点就打快点，又如张三是个骡子入给组里，他用时要是骡子没空，给他一个驴用，他是否有不满意的呢？还有就是半路牲口死了。死主个人他是否还要分红？
    三、积肥也顶股金分副业红利，但是有的户肥多，有的户肥少，也即股金的多少不同，分红当然按股金多少分，但是肥（也就是本钱）上到地里就没有了，将来这肥料（资本）又怎样计算呢？今年积了肥明年还分红不呢？
    四、牲口、肥料都分副业红利，假如副业赚不下钱或赚的很少，那将怎样办？又如农业收入内如果没有红利，或者还没打够评议产量时，牲口就不能分红了。（沙河办公室）
    编者按：沙河东沟与晋城庚能的作法，都是按当地条件，进一步提高互助生产的尝试，各地条件不同，自然不能勉强采用。但为交流经验使这一作法更加完善起见，希望读者尤其领导生产的同志们，随时提出意见或疑问来。沙河办公室所提问题，请太岳分社根据具体情况予以答复，并望连续报导实验情形。
