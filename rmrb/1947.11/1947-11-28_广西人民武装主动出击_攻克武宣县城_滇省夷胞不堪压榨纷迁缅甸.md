　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. To cooperate with the People's Liberation Army's counter-offensive, the Guangxi People's Armed Forces have recently been continuously launching proactive attacks. According to a Liuzhou report in the Minjin Minguo Daily: The Rentian Armed Forces, active in southeastern Guangxi, captured Wuxuan County Town on the Qianhe River in early this month (note: the city is located only one hundred kilometers southeast of Liuzhou). The county magistrate of the Jiang bandits and county government officials were panic-stricken and fled in disgrace before the People's Armed Forces entered the city. The People's Armed Forces are also very active in Guixian and Hengxian, which are adjacent to Wuxuan. (Note: Guixian and Hengxian were once captured by the People's Armed Forces last month).

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. According to a Kunming special dispatch in the Tianjin Dagong Daily on the 4th of this month: Ethnic minorities in Cheli, Fo Hai, Nanqiao, and other counties on the southwestern border of Yunnan Province are selling off their cattle, horses, and household property and moving into Burma because they cannot bear the exorbitant taxes and levies imposed by the local government of the Jiang bandits. According to a Cheli dispatch: The people and livestock in the county must be registered and taxed. Each horse must pay 170,000 yuan in tax each year, and each head of cattle must pay 105,000 yuan per year (all in Jiang currency). Furthermore, in June and July of this year alone, hundreds of Baiyi Kala families were forced into Burma each month, mainly due to the Jiang authorities' frantic conscription and collection of cattle and horse license taxes.

　　广西人民武装主动出击
    攻克武宣县城
  　滇省夷胞不堪压榨纷迁缅甸
    【新华社陕北廿六日电】为配合人民解放军大反攻，广西人民武装近日不断主动出击。据民津民国日报柳州消息：活跃于广西东南部之人天武装于本月初，一举攻克黔河沿岸之武宣县城（按该城位于柳州东南仅一百公里），该县蒋匪县长及县府职员惊慌万状，于人民武装进城前纷纷狼狈逃命。武宣邻近之贵县、横县，人民武装亦甚活跃。（按贵县与横县上月间曾一度为人民武装所攻克）。
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】据天津大公报本月四日昆明专电报导：滇省西南边境车里、佛海、南桥等县夷胞，因不堪蒋匪地方政府苛捐杂税之压榨，均纷纷出售牛马家产，迁入缅甸境居住。据车里讯：该县人民、牲畜均须登记纳税，每一匹马每年要纳税十七万元，每头牛每年纳税十万五千元（均蒋币）。又今年六七月间，仅摆夷卡拉族被逼入缅境者每月即有数百家之多，其主要原因亦系由蒋当局疯狂征兵及收牛马牌照税等所致。
