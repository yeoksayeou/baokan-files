Pingshun Seventh District United Cooperative First Establishes Credit Department
　Poor Peasants and Hired Laborers Borrow Funds for Production

[Our Pingshun Dispatch] The Pingshun Seventh District United Cooperative, having accepted the spirit of the cooperative conference, corrected the cooperative's direction, and universally launched a credit cooperative movement. Director Shi and everyone studied how to promote the development of credit services and establish credit cooperatives (departments) in various villages. Everyone unanimously believed that to achieve universal development in various villages, it was necessary to start with the district cooperative as a pioneer and establish a credit department to promote the villages. Therefore, the production units operated by the district cooperative, such as pharmacies, were reorganized. Based on the needs of the masses, those that should be closed were closed, and those that should be transferred were transferred to the masses for self-management. Fifty million yuan was extracted from the funds as credit funds, and the county bank provided another fifty million yuan in assistance, totaling one million yuan to establish a credit department (district credit bank), which officially opened for business on the 13th of this month. After the opening, each village cooperative was immediately notified that any liberated peasants who had difficulties in production could come to the cooperative for loans. After learning this, the villages, mainly composed of poor peasants and hired laborers, organized production and went to the district cooperative for loans. Since its establishment, the cooperative has loaned out 250,000 yuan for transportation (monthly interest of 4.5%), 300,000 yuan for textiles, and 250,000 yuan for commerce (monthly interest of 8%), totaling 800,000 yuan in loans, and collected interest of 14,910 yuan. During the process of lending, the masses were constantly educated and propagandized, and the masses generally reflected, "In the past, we didn't understand that the credit cooperative was good for us, but today we understand." Under this influence, the masses voluntarily deposited money, and more than 500,000 yuan has now been absorbed.

This has had a significant direct impact on various villages and laid the foundation for the future development of credit cooperatives in the Seventh District. Now, the cadres of the district cooperative have gone to the countryside to explore experiences. According to the self-reports of various villages, eight villages, including Xingcheng, are preparing to establish them.

　　平顺七区联社首建信用部
  　贫雇纷纷贷款生产
    【本报平顺讯】平顺七区区联社，接受了合作会议的精神，扭正合作社方向，普遍开展信用合作运动。史社长和大家研究，怎样才能推动各村开展了信用业务，建立信用社（部），大家一致认为，要使各村普遍开展，必须从区社开始打头炮，建立信用部，来推动各村。于是就将区社经营的生产单位，如药铺等，打叠一下，根据群众需要，该停办停办，该转让的转让给群众自己经营，并从资金内抽出五十万元，作为信用资金，县银行又扶助五十万元，共百万资金建立信用部（区信用银号），于本月十三日正式开张营业。开张后随即通知各村社，凡是翻身农民在生产上有困难的，即可来本社贷款。各村知悉后，即以贫雇为主组织生产，纷纷到区社贷款。该社自成立起至今已贷出运输款二十五万元（月息四分五），纺织款三十万元，商业款二十五万元（月息八分），共贷出款八十万元，收利息洋一四九一○元。在进行放贷中，不断宣传教育群众，群众普遍反映说：“过去咱不懂信用社对自己好，今天可认识了。”在这种影响下，群众自动存款，现已吸收到五十余万元。
    这样给各村直接影响很大，给七区今后开展信用社打下了基础，现在区社干部已下乡摸索经验，据各村自报，有杏城等八个村，正在准备成立中。
