　　Snippets from Enlistment in Fushan
　　Good People are Allowed to Enlist
　　Zhang Shengde, a landlord from Yaodian Village, Xing Shu Yuan Administrative Village, Fifth District of Fushan, told his son, Zhang Deyi, to register for enlistment at the village office. During the mass review, people said, "He is a landlord, can he willingly serve us after we took back our houses and belongings from him?" As a result, he was resolutely rejected by the masses. Zhang Shengde then had his sons, Zhang Dezhi and Zhang Dexi, run to Qiushuzhuang to register overnight. The masses said, "No, no, how can a landlord enlist?" The bully Zhao Desheng wanted to register, but the masses found out that he had worked in the garrison, robbed the common people, and after being struggled against by the masses last May, he ran to the enemy in Hongdong. After being captured by our army, he escaped again. After research, the masses resolutely refused to let him enlist. Then there was Cheng Zhankui from Bao Dian Town, Changzi County, who lived in Yaodian and asked to enlist, but the masses knew that he had abducted a woman from his village this spring and ran to Yaodian to hide, so they didn't let him enlist either. He repeatedly asked, willing to find a guarantor for the masses and make a written statement, vowing not to desert, but the masses thought he was unreliable, thinking that if he could abduct a woman in the village, he could also cause problems in the army, so they sent him back to his original place to let the masses review him.
　　Returning Victorious, Then Getting Married
　　Guo Yuxiu, a student from Fushan Sixth High School, automatically signed up to join the army at school. When his father-in-law, Zhang Yanming, found out, he said to his family, "See, that kid isn't hopeless; signing up to join the army isn't just an honor for his family, it's an honor for our family too." After hearing this, Yuxiu's fiancée, Zhang Xiulan, thought for a while, and with her father's consent, on September 30th, the day the new recruits from the Second District gathered to go to the city, she took out the thousand yuan she had saved up and went with her father. After her father spoke with Guo Yuxiu, she said to Yuxiu with a shy face, "This thousand yuan is what I usually save, take it and spend it, work hard to fight Chiang Kai-shek, I hope that after you win the battle, we will get married." Yuxiu smiled and said, "Thank you for your trouble, go back! I won't come back until I defeat Chiang Kai-shek." The masses all shouted slogans: "Zhang Xiulan is so brave, sending her man to join the army," at this time Zhang Xiulan had long since scurried into the crowd and disappeared.
　　Brothers Compete to Go to the Front
　　Zhang Wenxue and Zhang Kexue, two brothers from Hutouling, Fourth District of Fushan, after hearing the news of victory at the enlistment meeting in their village, and seeing the glorious things like fathers sending sons and wives sending husbands, Zhang Wenxue rushed to say, "Our family is a turned-over household, I am twenty-seven years old this year, it is the time to be a soldier." Before he finished speaking, Kexue said, "Big brother, you have sores on your body and can't walk far, and you have two children, you take care of everything at home! I am only twenty-one years old now, it is better for me to join the army." Zhang Wenxue said, "You are young and not used to going out, I should go!" As the two brothers were arguing, their father, Zhang Chongyou, hurriedly interrupted and said, "Your big brother is sick and may not be able to join the army." Zhang Kexue said happily, "That's right! It is right for me to go." His wife, Kong Fanmei, said with a happy smile on the side, "Joining the army is glorious, go! I will definitely work hard in production, you don't have to worry about anything in the family." (Compiled by Zhao Han)

　　浮山参军点滴
    好人才让参军
    浮山五区杏树垣行政村尧店地主张盛德教他儿子张德义到村公所报名参军，群众审查时说：“他是地主成份，咱们把房子东西从他手里要回来，他还能甘心为咱们服务吗？”结果被群众坚决拒绝了。张盛德又叫他儿子张德智、张德喜连夜跑到秋树庄报名，群众说：“不要不要，地主还能参军？”奸霸赵德胜要报名，群众查出他过去在警备队干过事，抢过老百姓东西，去年五月被群众斗争后，他又跑到洪洞敌人那里，被我军俘虏后，又逃跑了，群众研究结果，坚决不让他参军。又有长子鲍店镇的程占奎，在尧店居住，要求参军，但群众知道他今春拐了他村一个女人，跑到尧店躲避，也不让他参军；他再三要求，情愿给群众找保人立字据，发誓不开小差，但群众认为他不可靠，以为他在村里能拐女人，到部队也能出问题，结果送他回原借让群众审查。
    胜利回来再结婚
    浮山六高学生郭毓秀，在学校自动报名参军。他丈人张严明知道了，给家里人说：“你看那娃可不是没出息的；报名参军，不惟他家光荣，咱家也很光荣”。毓秀的未婚妻张秀兰听了这话，想了想后，商得她爸爸同意，在九月三十日二区新战士集合进城的那天，拿出她平素节约下的一千元随她父亲去了。她父亲和郭毓秀谈话后，她满面含羞的向毓秀说：“这一千元是我平素节约下的你拿去花了，加油打蒋介石，我盼望你打了胜仗回来后，咱们再结婚”。毓秀微笑的说：“费心，你回去吧！我不打倒蒋介石不回来。”群众都喊起口号：“张秀兰真勇敢，送她男人把军参”，这时张秀兰早窜到人丛里找不见面了。
    兄弟争上前线
    浮山四区虎头岭张文学、张科学兄弟二人，在本村的参军会上，听了胜利消息，看到人家父送子妻送夫等光荣事情，回家后，张文学先抢着说：“咱家里是个翻身户，我今年二十七岁了，正是当兵的时候。”话还没落音，科学说：“大哥你身上害疮，不能走远路，又有两个孩子，你在家里照顾一切吧！我现在才二十一岁，还是我去参军好。”张文学说：“你年龄小出门不惯，还是我去吧！”弟兄二人正在争论，父亲张崇有就连忙插嘴说：“你大哥身上有病，去参军恐不行。”张科学就很高兴的说：“对啦！我去是正理”。他老婆孔繁梅在旁边喜眉笑眼的说：“参军是光荣的你去吧！我一定好好劳动生产，家中各样事情都不用你操心。”（赵寒整理）
