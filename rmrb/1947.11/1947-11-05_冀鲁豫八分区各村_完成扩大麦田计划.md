(Report from our newspaper in Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 3rd) A compilation of news from the Eighth Sub-district: According to reports from Kunwu, Weihe, Neihuang, and other places, villages have completed their wheat planting plans after a period of intense cultivation. In Kunwu County, 160,000 emancipated peasants celebrated the victory of the great counter-offensive with a burst of production, completing the wheat planting task in half a month (from the 15th of the eighth month to the 1st of the ninth month of the lunar calendar). Wheat fields account for more than 60% of the total cultivated land in the county. In Niuzhuang Village, in the Third District, 19 *qing* of land were planted out of the village's 29 *qing*. In Yanglou Village, in the First District, 50 laborers and 30 draft animals voluntarily combined their efforts to complete the sowing of 9 *qing* of early-season wheat in 20 days, in addition to the autumn harvest. The wheat has already sprouted like "chicken claws" or "inverted seedlings," and they are rushing to plant late-season wheat. Women in most villages have become the main force on the production front. Zhang Qiming, the director of the women's association of Zhanglou in the Seventh District, and Zhang Yinzhi, the village head, not only organized all the women in the village, but also personally led nine women to plow more than five *mu* of land in one day. Children and sister groups in Ximulou, in the Third District, took on daily tasks such as fetching water, grinding flour, picking cotton, and cutting grass for the whole village, freeing up full laborers and livestock for the autumn harvest and wheat planting. The enthusiasm for production this time is unprecedented. From the elderly of seventy to children of eleven or twelve, all have joined in this harvesting and planting campaign. The reason for such high enthusiasm is mainly that the peasants have been emancipated and have obtained land, livestock, vehicles, and farm implements. As Niu Shengtian, a tenant farmer in Niuzhuang, said: "In the past, when we farmed for others, we had to rush early and stay up late. Now that we are farming our own land, how can we not be more diligent?" Secondly, the planned promotion and control by the leadership, as well as the leadership of the village cadres, are also powerful reasons for the completion of wheat planting this time. In Lujialou, in the Third District of Weihe, taking advantage of the gaps in war support duties, they planted 843.5 *mu* of wheat in the eight days after October 7th, exceeding the number of *mu* planted in previous years. Niuzhangzhuang, in the Third District of Neihuang, put forward the slogans "Plan wheat planting early, achieve no idle time" and "Do a good job of wheat planting, and victory will come early" during the wheat planting, and in five days, all the land that could be planted with wheat was planted, except for 30% of the land that could not be planted.

[Another Dispatch] At a mass meeting in Tanzhuang, Fifth District of Nanfeng, Wang Futian raised the issue of planting more wheat, saying, "This year we must plant more wheat. This is the seed of victory. With more grain, any difficulty can be solved. If we have money, we have money; if we need bullets, we have bullets, and we can defeat Chiang Kai-shek." The masses spoke enthusiastically and unanimously expressed that in order to defeat Chiang Kai-shek, they had to plant a few more *mu* of wheat. Originally, Tanzhuang had already planted 75% of its wheat, but after this discussion, everyone said that they had to plant a few more *mu*. According to statistics, Tanzhuang has now planted 80% of its wheat, and in order not to waste a single piece of land, even the wasteland occupied by the former traitor Wen Dake's bunker has been planted with wheat. In Yangzhuang, under the slogan "The poor of the world are one family," men, women, old and young mobilized together. More than 200 people in the village organized 17 mutual aid teams. Under the leadership and influence of the poor peasant activists, the enthusiasm for wheat planting was very high. From the afternoon of the 10th, they plowed, harrowed, and sowed, and completed the task on the 17th, reaching 80% of the total cultivated land in the village.

    冀鲁豫八分区各村
    完成扩大麦田计划
    【本报冀鲁豫三日电】综合八分区消息：根据昆吾、卫河、内黄等地报导，各村经过紧张抢种，纷纷完成种麦计划。昆吾全县十六万翻身农民，在大反攻的胜利中，以突击的生产行动表示庆祝，半月内（古历八月十五至九月一日），完成了种麦任务。全县麦地占耕地总数百分之六十强。三区牛庄全村二十九顷地，赶种十九顷。一区杨楼全村五十个劳动力、三十个畜力，自愿结合起来，在二十天内，除秋收外，完成九顷早茬麦的播种任务，现已“鸡爪颗”或“倒股”，且正赶种晚茬麦。大部分村庄妇女成了生产战线上的主力军。七区张楼妇会主任张启明、村长张银之，除把全村妇女组织起来外，亲自带领九个妇女，一天翻地五亩多。三区西木楼儿童、姐妹团，担当了全村打水、推磨、摘花、割草等生活，省出全劳力牲口秋收种麦。这次的生产情绪是空前的，老至七十，小至十一、二岁的儿童、姐妹，统统卷入这次的收种运动里。情绪所以这样高，主要是农民翻了身，获得了土地、牲口、车辆、农具等，正象牛庄佃户牛生田说：“过去给人家种地，还赶早搭晚，现在种自己的地，还能不吃心。”其次，领导上有计划的推动掌握，以及村干的带头，也是这次完成种麦的有力原因。卫河三区吕家楼，抓紧战勤空隙，在十月七日以后的八天中，种了八百四十三亩五分麦子，超过了往年种麦的亩数。内黄三区牛张庄，在种麦时提出：“种麦早打算，做到四不闲”、“种麦搞的好，胜利来的早”的口号，五天的时间，除百分之三十的地不能种麦外，其余可能种麦的地全部种完了。
    【又电】南峰五区谭庄群众会上，王福田提出多种麦的问题，他说：“今年咱得多种麦，这是胜利的苗子，粮食多了啥困难也能解决，要钱有钱，要子弹有子弹，就能打败蒋介石。”群众发言甚为热烈，一致表示为了打倒蒋介石，得多种几亩麦，本来谭庄已种麦百分之七十五，经这一酝酿，最后都说还得多种几亩麦。据统计，现谭庄已种麦百分之八十，为了不荒一分地，把前汉奸文大可的堡垒占的荒也种上了麦。杨庄种麦在“天下穷人是一家”的口号下，男女老少齐动员，全村二百余口人，组织了十七个互助组，在贫农积极分子带头影响下，种麦情绪非常高涨，自十日下午起，连犁耙带种，至十七日即全部完成，全村种麦面积达到全耕地百分之八十。
