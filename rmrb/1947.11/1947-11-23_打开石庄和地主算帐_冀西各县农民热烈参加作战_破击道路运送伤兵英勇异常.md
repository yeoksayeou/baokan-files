Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀, November 21st: During the liberation of Shijiazhuang campaign, more than 40,000 militiamen and civilians from five counties including Lingshou and Pingshan, carrying more than 4,000 stretchers, more than 2,000 carts, and more than 3,900 livestock, rushed to the front line and successfully completed arduous tasks such as breaking roads and transporting the wounded. Li Jinshu, the squad leader of the Pingshan demolition team, led all members of his squad to assist the troops in digging fortifications in an open area 150 meters away from the enemy. They worked continuously for 15 hours and quickly completed the task. After receiving the task, the Tang County Expedition Team rushed to the front line overnight. The first company of militiamen in the county destroyed 120 zhang of traffic trenches in two hours. The eighth company of Zhao County militia, led by Company Commander Ma Bo, braved enemy fire to flatten the enemy's outer city moat, which was three or four zhang deep and two zhang wide. The militiamen of the company also rescued the wounded under the intense gunfire of the enemy, and returned to the front line three times in one night, and sent the wounded to the hospital again at dawn.

This newspaper's Taihang, November 21st: When Shijiazhuang was liberated, thousands of emancipated peasants from the first, second, and third districts of our Huolu, led by the county magistrate himself, wielding shovels and hoes amidst the fierce artillery fire on the night of the 10th, broke and filled more than two li long of the outer moat, which was more than one zhang wide outside the city, including ten large gaps, so that vehicles transporting ammunition and combat troops could pass smoothly. More than 500 peasants from the third district, in addition to breaking two large gaps, also built fortifications together with the soldiers fighting on the front line, showing infinite heroism. They carried out demolition competitions, successfully completing the task of assisting the main force in combat, and won the praise of the soldiers of the Jin察冀 Liberation Army.

This newspaper's Taihang, November 21st: The emancipated peasants of Huolu heard the artillery fire of our army's general attack on Shijiazhuang on the night of the 6th, and said, "Open Shijiazhuang and settle the general account!" They searched for high ground to watch the artillery fire attacking Shijiazhuang, and voluntarily collected goods to set up reception stations to comfort the wounded soldiers. Women in Liangjiazhuang village hugged their babies, children lined up, and old men draped in quilts, went to the top of Dongshan every night in the early winter night to visit our army firing artillery at Shijiazhuang. The sound of artillery was thunderous, and there was a blaze of fire. Everyone was happy, shouting and laughing, clapping their hands and cheering. The children pointed to the rows of artillery fire from our army, looked at the faces of the adults and said, "Look! It's clearing up, and Shijiazhuang is raining iron hailstones!" The old men stroked their beards and smiled. Hu Donghua, chairman of the Women's Rescue Association, immediately convened a meeting of members to discuss: "Our army is attacking Shijiazhuang, what should we do in the rear?" "We must comfort our army, quickly liberate Shijiazhuang, and settle the general account with the feudal landlords, special agents and traitors!" The women collected 223 eggs, 9 jin of noodles, 40 jin of flour, and 13 packs of cigarettes; they voluntarily established a "wounded soldier reception station", happily taking turns to serve there. The Farmers' Association saw the women's enthusiasm and voluntarily proposed: "We will not only be active with stretchers, but also offer some things to show our feelings." On the 9th alone, they comforted the wounded with 1,102 jin of red dates, 35 eggs, and 7 packs of cigarettes.

    【新华社晋察冀二十一日电】解放石家庄战役中，灵寿、平山等五县四万余民兵、群众，携带担架四千余付，大车两千余辆，牲口三千九百余头，奔赴前线，胜利完成破击道路、运送伤员等艰巨任务。平山破击队班长李金恕带全班队员至离敌百五十米之开阔地协助部队挖工事，连续工作达十五小时，迅速完成任务。唐县远征队接到任务后，星夜驰往前线，该县民兵第一连两小时破除交通沟一百二十丈。赵县民兵第八连，在连长马波率领下，冒敌炮火平毁敌三、四丈深、二丈宽的外市沟。该连民兵并在敌密集枪弹射击下，抢救伤员，一夜往返火线三次，黎明又将伤员送往医院。
    【本报太行二十一日电】石家庄解放时，我获鹿一、二、三个区的数千翻身农民，于十日夜，由县长亲自率领，在猛烈的炮火声中，挥动着锹、镢，将市外一丈多宽的外壕破击并填平了二里多长，其中还有十个大缺口，使运送弹药的车辆与作战部队能顺利通过。三区五百余农民除破了两个大缺口外，又和火线上正在战斗的战士，共同修筑工事，表现了无限英勇。他们进行着破击竞赛，胜利地完成协助主力作战的任务，获得晋察冀解放军战士的赞扬。
    【本报太行二十一日电】获鹿各村翻身农民，于六日夜听到我大军总攻石庄的炮声，都磨拳擦掌的说：“打开石庄算总帐！”纷纷寻找高地，观望攻打石庄的炮火，并自动募集物品，成立招待所，慰劳伤兵。梁家庄村妇女们抱着娃娃，儿童们排成队，老汉们披着被子，在初冬的寒夜，每晚到东山头上，看望我军往石庄市打炮。炮声如雷，一片火光，大家高兴得又叫又笑，拍手叫好。孩子们手指着我军一排一排的炮火，看着大人的脸说：“看！睛着天，石庄下铁冷子（雹子）了！”老汉们摸着胡子笑了。妇救会主席胡冬花等，马上召集会员讨论：“咱们军队打石庄，咱在后方该干啥？”“要慰劳咱们的军队，赶快解放了石庄，和封建地主特务汉奸算总帐！”妇女们凑合了二百二十三个鸡蛋，九斤挂面，四十斤白面，十三包纸烟；自动成立了一个“伤兵招待所”，高兴的轮流在那里伺候着。农会看见妇女这股劲，也自动提出：“我们不但担架积极，也要慰劳点东西表表心。”九号一天，就慰劳了红枣一千一百零二斤，鸡蛋三十五个，纸烟七包。
