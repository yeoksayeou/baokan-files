　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: Belgrade Dispatch: With more than a month remaining before the end of the year, good news of various industrial sectors in Yugoslavia completing and exceeding the first year's production plan of the Five-Year Plan are pouring in like snowflakes. In Belgrade alone, more than twenty industrial combinations have completed this year's plan. Among them, the electrical industry sector exceeded the plan by more than 5% on the 18th of this month. The largest shoe factory "Proletariat" in Belgrade completed the plan on the 8th of this month. The "Vardes" textile factory in Vrazdin completed the plan on the 5th of this month, and its production volume has exceeded the pre-war level of 1939 by 180%. The performance of the distillery in Zagreb is particularly amazing, and it has now exceeded this year's plan by 66%. In addition, the smelting and casting factory of Haras Mine completed the plan 80 days ahead of schedule. The "Vivichu" paper mill completed the plan 53 days ahead of schedule. The industrial departments that have completed the plan have all started production for the 1948 plan. The South Communist Party's "Combat News" published an article on the 19th, praising this achievement as "already foreshadowing the complete possibility of all enterprises completing and exceeding the plan before the end of the year." The Serbian National Front's newspaper "Glas" emphasized in its editorial that the reason for the development of production lies in the mechanization of production, the organization in production, and the high level of workers' political and cultural standards. The widespread and enthusiastic revolutionary competition is the most important factor. (Note: By the time the Southern Country's Five-Year Plan was completed in 1951, its total industrial output will have increased by 93% compared with the pre-war year of 1939.)

　　南国许多工业部门提前完成今年计划
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】贝尔格莱德讯：现离岁终尚一月有余，然南斯拉夫各地各工业部门完成并超过五年计划第一年生产计划之佳讯，已如雪片飞来。仅贝城一地，即有二十余个工业组合完成本年计划，其中电气工业部门在本月十八日已超过计划百分之五以上，贝城最大之“无产阶级”制鞋厂在本月八日即完成计划。伏拉兹丁之“瓦迭斯”大纺织厂则于本月五日完成计划，其生产量已超过战前水平百分之一百八十。萨格勒布之酒精厂成绩尤为惊人，现已超过本年计划达百分之六十六。此外如哈勒斯矿之冶炼及铸造工厂，较预定计划提前八十日完成。“维维区”造纸厂，提前五十三日完成计划。完成计划之各工业部门，均已开始一九四八年计划之生产。南共“战斗报”特于十九日撰论，颂扬此项成就“已预告一切企业在年底前完成并超过计划之完全可能”。塞尔维亚民族阵线机关报“格拉斯”报则于其社论中强调生产发展之原因在于生产之机械化，生产中之组织性，及工人政治文化水准之高涨。而广泛热烈之革命竞赛，尤为最重要之因索。（按：至一九五一年南国五年计划完成时，其工业总产量将较战前一九三九年增加百分之九十三。）
