Ji-Lu-Yu
Liberated Women Have High Awareness
Various Places Eagerly Offer Anti-Aggression Shoes

[Report from our newspaper in Ji-Lu-Yu, 20th] Liberated women have a high level of awareness, and various places are vying to donate anti-aggression shoes. In Weihui District alone, 1,300 pairs were donated within three days. At a women's meeting in Yingmancheng Village, Weihui District, the female village head said that when she was at a meeting in the district, other villages were donating anti-aggression shoes. Before she could finish speaking, Zhang Airong搶著 said, "The troops are fighting desperately at the front; how can we let them go barefoot? Let's make some too." Ma Jinxi said, "I used to beg for food, but now I've been liberated and become a cadre. I'll make two pairs." Everyone chimed in, and they immediately signed up to make 93 pairs. It was originally scheduled to be completed in three days, but when the shoes were delivered, 107 pairs were delivered. In five villages in Qingfeng District, 378 pairs were made, with some women making three pairs each. In Qian Sanliying Village, Fan County Fifth District, when the issue of donating anti-aggression shoes was discussed at a mass meeting, Wang Lianyi said, "After liberation, we have houses, and men, women, young, and old are changing clothes. Our lives are getting better. The soldiers are barefoot at the front; it is right for us to make shoes." After she finished speaking, everyone laughed, and the whole village made 40 pairs. Women in Zhuxian City made 156 pairs of shoes and 360 cotton-padded clothes for the East China Field Army within five days. The shoes made were stronger and better than those from public factories. In Li Shanyi Village, Neihuang Fifth District, all 32 women members of the village donated 29 pairs of shoes. In addition, Puyang County and other places are also stepping up their efforts. Furthermore, women in Qiaolou, Heze, made 700 quilts for the army in one and a half days and were commended by a circular from the county headquarters. On the 25th of last month, our army's × unit moved to Qiaolou Village. Most of the soldiers and cadres did not have cotton quilts. The women of the village took the initiative to help make them, and 60 militiamen helped to gin and card cotton, not resting all night. In addition to issuing a circular of commendation, the county headquarters ordered the responsible comrades in the district to assess and record merit for the village.
