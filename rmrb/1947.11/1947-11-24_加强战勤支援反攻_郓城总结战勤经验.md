　　Strengthen Wartime Support for the Counteroffensive
  　Yuncheng Summarizes Wartime Experience
    [This newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 19th dispatch] On the 3rd of this month, Yunbei County held a conference of district and village cadres from the entire county to summarize wartime support work. The conference lasted for three days, beginning with reports from typical districts, followed by more than a day of general discussion, and concluded with a summary by County Magistrate Ma. The summary covered the achievements of the past four months of wartime support work since the Liu-Deng army crossed the river to the south, as well as specific methods for rectifying wartime support work in the future. The achievements of the past four months of wartime support work have been significant. During this period, there were two "seesaw" battles and large-scale wartime support efforts, especially after the Chen-Su army crossed the river to the south. Despite continuous rainy days, district and village cadres ensured the completion of wartime support tasks under various difficult conditions. Secondly, the Yellow River flooded ten times. More than 30,000 carts and 4,500 laborers were used for building dams, emergency repairs, and transporting stones and grass. Wartime support tasks were even more demanding, especially along the banks of the dam and major transportation routes. However, some shortcomings are also worth noting and improving. For example, a lot of manpower and resources were wasted. According to statistics, there were four instances of stretcher teams assembling and then returning; waiting for tasks was common; the allocation of labor was uneven, with villages near ferry crossings and main roads contributing more; and finally, the commendation of model workers was not emphasized. In order to promote achievements and overcome shortcomings, the following methods were discussed for future wartime support work: (1) Reorganize the self-defense forces. (2) Improve the village command posts. (3) On the issue of work point calculation, oppose the practice of calculating work points per trip, and uniformly calculate work points per day. In order to encourage raising more cattle, one cow is counted as one person's work. As for the deployment of military dependents, if one person is serving in the military, a strong laborer in the family will be exempt from deployment; if there are two strong laborers, one will be deployed, but the village should not provide special care. Residents in the riverbed disaster area will be exempt from deployment. (4) The issue of always having stretchers ready: they should be constantly prepared, and the second batch should be ready to start work promptly after the first batch leaves. (5) Regarding the commendation of model workers, it is necessary to thoroughly convey this to the masses. After each stretcher team returns, model individuals should be selected, model teams should be selected in the village, model villages should be selected in the sub-district, and model districts should be selected in the county. Bad practices should be criticized, and righteousness should be established.

　　加强战勤支援反攻
  　郓城总结战勤经验
    【本报冀鲁豫十九日电】本月三日，郓北县召开全县各区区村干部大会，总结战勤工作。大会进行三天，首先是各区典型汇报，又经过一天多的大会讨论，最后由马县长作总结。总结自刘邓大军南渡后，四个月来的战勤工作成绩，及今后整顿战勤工作的具体办法。四个月来战勤工作成绩是很大的，其间经过两次“拉锯”与大战勤，尤其陈粟大军渡河南下后，每日阴雨连绵，而各区村干部在种种困难条件下，保证了战勤任务的完成。其次黄河发了十次水，打坝抢险送石送草，即用大车三万辆以上，民夫四千五百人。特别是大堤两旁及交通要道上，战勤任务更繁忙。但有些缺点也是值得警惕与改进的。如浪费不少人力物力，据统计有过四次担架队集合后，又回去了；时常等任务；再就是劳力调剂不均，凡靠渡口及大道的村庄出的多；最后是立功表模抓的不紧。为发扬成绩克服缺点，对今后战勤工作讨论出以下办法：（一）整理自卫队。（二）健全村指挥部。（三）计功问题、反对论趟计功，一律按天计功。为提倡多喂牛起见，一个牛按一个人计工，至于军属的出差问题，如果有一人在外参军，家有一个壮丁免差，有两个壮丁者出一人，但村里边不应照顾。河床灾民，一律免差。（四）长备担架问题，要经常准备好，第一批走后，第二批要及时准备上班。（五）关于立功表模，要具体贯澈到群众中去，每次出担架回来要选出模范人，村中选模范班，小区选模范村，县选模范区，坏的批评，树立正气。
