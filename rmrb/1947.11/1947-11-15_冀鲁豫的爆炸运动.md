　　The Explosion Movement in Hebei-Shandong-Henan

　　Since March to September, the explosion movement in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area has been initially launched, and good news of explosions has been constantly coming from various places. The statistics are as follows: Militiamen in the Second District of Changqing planted three mines, killing eight enemies. Militiamen in the First District of Tai'an West killed one enemy with a mine. In Juancheng, a mine laid by Tong Kou killed one enemy, and Yang Yongzhen's explosion team killed 31 enemies. Su Zengtian's team used a mine to scare away the enemy who were holding a meeting. Landmines bloomed at Black Tiger Temple in Kunshan, killing and wounding 11 enemies. Zhao Bingxiang of Junan killed nine enemies in three explosions. Militiamen in Dingtao killed and wounded three enemies in one explosion. The Changyuan explosion team killed and wounded 11 enemies in four explosions. The Minquan explosion team combined sniping with explosions to kill, wound, and capture six enemies, and seized two mules. Qibin combined landmines and gunfire to kill and wound five enemies and seize two rifles. The explosion team of the Seventh Sub-district deployed a large minefield in Xinkou Village, killing and wounding 21 soldiers of Chiang Kai-shek's New Fifth Army. The Dongping Flying Explosion Team traveled to Xiguan, Wenshang, killing and wounding three enemies with three mines. Based on the above materials alone, a total of 90 enemies were killed, wounded, and captured. These achievements are naturally not surprising compared to other military regions, but in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area, they are unprecedented. In the half-year struggle, the following experiences have been gained:

　　1. The key to carrying out explosions: (1) The leadership has attached importance to the transformation of this movement. Since the District Party Committee proposed carrying out the explosion movement this year, the Military Commission first held two training classes for county and district cadres on explosions. More than 100 cadres mastered explosion techniques, arousing the attention of cadres at all levels. For example, the Fourth Sub-district trained explosion experts. The Seventh District Committee instructed all counties that any difficulties in carrying out explosions must be resolved by any means. Wu of Dongping County called on Party, government, civilian, and military cadres to learn explosion techniques. Facts have proved that where the leadership attaches importance, the explosions are carried out well. (2) Overcome ideological obstacles. At the beginning, some cadres believed that landmines were not suitable for plains, and some believed that learning about explosions was dangerous, and they could be killed by explosions if they were not careful. Secondly, the idea of "steel guns only" was at play, believing that landmines were useless. The root cause of the above ideas was mainly a lack of understanding of the performance and power of landmines. After the leadership understood the situation, various places launched in-depth mobilizations, explaining the role and power of landmines in the current era. In education, they talked less and did more, and overcame everyone's ideological obstacles through practical experiments, and improved their confidence in learning about landmines before their emotions turned around. (3) Cadres take the lead. Because the vast majority of cadres have mastered explosion techniques, it has greatly promoted the development of the movement. For example, Comrade Jin Yishan, the military section chief of Changqing, actively and patiently educated the militiamen after being trained by the General Association, and fired the first shot with the spirit of personally taking the lead, killing eight enemies with three mines. Comrade Zhao Bingxiang of Junan carried out three explosions in 20 days, killing nine enemies. Comrade Yang Haiyan, director of the Seventh Sub-district, personally created two great victories in Kunshan, killing and wounding 32 enemies.

　　2. Creation of landmine tactics: (1) From defense to offense, changing dead mines into live mines. In the past, most cadres and militiamen believed that landmines could only be used for defense and not for offense. This idea has been broken by facts. For example, the Dongping Flying Explosion Team traveled to Xiguan, Wenshang, killing and wounding three enemies with three mines, which greatly threatened the enemy's morale. After being bombed, the enemies inserted wooden boards with words scolding the enemies and writing: "Only allowed to look, only allowed to read, whoever pulls it is a bastard." The enemies never dared to move. On the contrary, when the enemies went out, the vanguard used sticks to poke the ground inch by inch. (2) Boldness and calmness, combined with sniping, is an effective way to kill and wound the enemy. For example, Liu Jinxue of the Qibin Militia Team, attacked the west end of Chenzhuang at night and set up a mine. When the stubborn bandit Ni Jingkun approached the minefield, he pulled the mine while shouting to charge. Five pairs of enemies fell to the ground with the sound of the explosion, and the enemy dragged the dead and fled. We only consumed one mine and three bullets, and seized two steel guns.

　　冀鲁豫的爆炸运动
    三至九月以来，冀鲁豫爆炸运动已初步展开，各地爆炸捷音不断传来。计有：长清二区民兵埋雷三颗，毙敌八名。太西一区民兵一雷炸毙敌一名。鄄城童口雷毙敌一名，杨永祯爆炸组毙敌卅一名。苏增田组的接敌拉雷吓散敌人开会。昆山黑虎庙的地雷开花毙伤敌十一名。巨南赵秉祥的三次爆炸毙敌九名。定陶民兵一次毙伤敌人三名。长垣爆炸队四次爆炸毙伤敌十一名。民权爆炸队冷枪结合爆炸毙伤俘敌六名，获骡子两头。齐滨雷枪结合毙伤敌五名，获步枪二枝。七分会爆炸队在新口村大摆地雷阵毙伤蒋匪新五军二十一名。东平飞行爆炸组远征汶上西关三雷毙伤敌三名。仅以上材料，共毙伤俘敌九十名，这些成绩比起其他军区自然不足为奇，但在冀鲁豫区说来，还是空前的。在半年的斗争中，获得以下几点经验：
    一、开展爆炸的关键：（一）领导思想重视了这一运动的转变。自今年区党委提出开展爆炸运动后，武委总会首先召开两期县区干部爆炸训练班，百余名干部掌握爆炸技术，引起各级干部的重视。如四分会的大训爆炸手，七地委指示各县，凡是开展爆炸上的困难，只要提出，必想尽办法解决。东平县武号召党政民武干部都要学会爆炸技术，事实证明，那里领导上重视了，那里的爆炸就开展的好。（二）克服思想障碍。开始部分干部认为地雷在平原不适用，有的认为学习爆炸危险性大，一不小心就会被炸死，自己不光荣。其次是钢枪主义作怪，认为地雷不管事。以上的思想根源，主要是不了解地雷的性能与威力。领导上了解思想后，各地展开深刻的动员，说明地雷在现时代的作用与威力，在教育中少讲多做，从实际试验中克服了大家的思想障碍，提高了学习地雷的信心，情绪才转过来。（三）干部带头。由于广大干部掌握了爆炸技术，对运动的开展有很大推动。例如长清军事股长金益山同志，由总会受训回去就积极耐心的教育民兵，用亲自带头的精神打响了第一炮，三雷毙敌八名。巨南赵秉祥同志二十天内三次爆炸，毙敌九名。七分会主任杨海岩同志亲自动手创造了昆山两次大捷，毙伤敌三十二名。
    二、地雷战术的创造：（一）由防御到进攻，变死雷为活雷。过去大部干部和民兵认为地雷只能防守不能进攻，这种思想已被事实打破了。如东平飞行爆炸组，远征汶上西关，三雷三炸，这对敌人精神上威胁很大。敌人挨炸后，他们插着木板上写着骂敌人词句，并写着：只许看，只许念，谁要拔，王八蛋。敌人始终未敢动，相反的敌人出门，先头部队用棍子捣着地皮一步一步的往前移。（二）大胆沉着，以冷枪结合爆炸，是杀伤敌人有效办法，如齐滨武工队刘金学，夜袭陈庄西头，设雷一颗。当顽杂倪景昆走近雷圈，他一边拉雷一边喊冲杀，五双敌人随雷声倒地，敌拖死逃窜，我仅消耗一雷三弹，获钢枪二支。（董效良）
