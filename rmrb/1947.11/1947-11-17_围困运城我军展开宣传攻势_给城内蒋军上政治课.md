　　Our Army Launches Propaganda Offensive During Siege of Yuncheng
  　Giving Political Lessons to Chiang's Troops in the City
    [This Dispatch from Taiyue, 15th] Our army, besieging Yuncheng, has launched a propaganda offensive against the increasingly panicked Chiang's troops inside the city. Zhang Junwen, a squad leader of a certain company, loaded wooden rifle grenades with leaflets containing the People's Liberation Army declaration and policies towards prisoners of war. He also wrote "A righteous bullet that does not hurt people" on the wooden handles and launched them into Yuncheng. The third squad leader and fighter Li Shenglian of the fifth company secretly approached the Chiang bandit positions, threw in propaganda materials, and shouted, "The propaganda has gone in!" Battalion Commander Ma of a certain battalion led soldiers to conduct on-site appeals to Chiang's troops, giving them two political lessons in a row. He loudly said, "Chiang's officers and soldiers, think about it. Many of your hometowns have been captured by the People's Liberation Army. Your parents and wives are waiting for you to return. Don't be cannon fodder for the traitor Chiang Kai-shek!" When we shouted to Chiang's troops at the Yanchi stronghold, they listened silently. As soon as we finished shouting, they asked, "Did you hear that?" The other side replied, "We heard it!"

　　围困运城我军展开宣传攻势
  　给城内蒋军上政治课
    【本报太岳十五日电】围困运城之我军，对城内日益恐慌之蒋军展开宣传攻势。某连张俊文班长在木制枪榴弹中装入人民解放军宣言及俘虏政策等传单，并在木柄上写着“义气弹不伤人”字样，向运城城内放射。五连三班长与战士李生良偷偷的摸到蒋匪阵地将宣传品掷进去，并喊着：“宣传品进去啦！”某营马营长并带领战士向蒋军进行阵地喊话，先后给蒋军上了两次政治课。他大声的说：“蒋军官兵想想吧，你们有不少的家乡被人民解放军打下来了，你们的父母妻子都盼望着你们回去，再不要给卖国贼蒋介石当炮灰啦！”盐池据点之蒋军在我喊话时则默默的听着，在我喊话刚毕发问：“你们听见没有？”对方就回答道：“听见啦！”
