Xinhua News Agency, 19th: Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association, stated at a rally of various democratic parties protesting against U.S. imperialist aggression on the 18th that the most vicious enemy of the world's people, the head of the imperialist robber gang, U.S. President Eisenhower, has arrived in Asia, in our country's territory – Taiwan – amidst the condemnations of the world. On behalf of all members of the China Democratic National Construction Association, I express my utmost protest along with the Chinese people! Eisenhower came to Asia after burying the Four-Power Summit in Paris, plotting a new war in the Far East, and tearing off his mask of peace. He came to Taiwan after suffering strong opposition from the Filipino people and resolute rejection from the Japanese people. The arrival of this "plague god" is another serious provocation by U.S. imperialism against the Chinese people and a complete exposure of its plot to create "two Chinas" and permanently occupy Taiwan.

He said that the Chinese people cannot tolerate the serious provocations of U.S. imperialism, and we must "strike back against those who inflict strikes"! More than a year ago, when Dulles came to Taiwan, we used artillery to demonstrate our power to him; on the 18th, Eisenhower came again, and we used even more intense artillery fire to demonstrate our power to him. These rows of earth-shaking cannon fire represent the Chinese people's disdain and contempt for U.S. imperialism, and express our extreme anger and protest! In simple and clear words: The great Chinese people are not to be insulted! If U.S. imperialism does not stop its provocative activities against the Chinese people and does not get out of Taiwan, then it will bear all the serious consequences. Blood debts must be repaid in blood! The old era of imperialism flaunting its power is gone forever!

Huang Yanpei emphasized that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's sacred territory. The resolution of the Taiwan issue is China's internal affair, and U.S. imperialism has no right to interfere. The government of the People's Republic of China has repeatedly made solemn declarations, and these have been recognized and supported by the people of the world. Today, Eisenhower came to Taiwan with malicious intentions, and no matter what kind of conspiracy he engages in, it is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. The Chinese people must and have the power to smash these conspiracies.

Huang Yanpei said that the people of Taiwan have a glorious revolutionary tradition. In the past, the people of Taiwan resisted the brutal oppression of Japanese imperialism, unyielding and indomitable, for fifty years; thirteen years ago, on February 28th, the people of Taiwan also resisted the tyranny of the Kuomintang reactionaries; three years ago, on May 24th, the people of Taiwan protested the murder of Liu Ziran and destroyed the American embassy. The people of the motherland cheered for every one of their glorious struggles. Now Eisenhower, this "plague god," has come in person. He has come with the sinister intention of further enslaving the people of Asia, and he has come to permanently occupy Taiwan. The Filipino people have already slapped him in the face. The Japanese people have given him an even louder slap. For ten years, the people of Taiwan have suffered from U.S. imperialist military aggression, political control, economic plunder, and cultural poisoning, and the people of Taiwan must not lightly forgive Eisenhower, this "plague god."

He concluded by saying that all members of our China Democratic National Construction Association must unite closely around the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, along with the people of the whole country, to fight to the end against the serious provocations and conspiracies of U.S. imperialism, for the liberation of Taiwan, and for the defense of world peace!

    中国民主建国会主任委员黄炎培讲话
    一定要予打击者以打击
    新华社19日讯　民建主任委员黄炎培18日在各民主党派反对美帝侵略的抗议集会上说，全世界人民最凶恶的敌人、帝国主义强盗头子美国总统艾森豪威尔，在举世唾骂声中到了亚洲，到了我国的领土——台湾。我代表中国民主建国会全体成员同中国人民一道表示极大的抗议！艾森豪威尔是在巴黎埋葬了四国首脑会议，策划了远东新战争的阴谋，撕下了和平的假面具之后，来到亚洲的。他是在遭受了菲律宾人民的强烈反对，和日本人民的坚决拒绝之后，来到台湾的。这个“瘟神”的来到，是美帝国主义对中国人民的又一次严重挑衅，是制造“两个中国”以至永久霸占台湾的阴谋的彻底暴露。
    他说，中国人民不能容忍美帝国主义的严重挑衅，我们一定要“予打击者以打击”！一年多以前，当杜勒斯来到台湾的时候，我们曾经用大炮向他示过威；18日，艾森豪威尔又来了，我们就用更猛烈的炮火向他示威。这一排一排震动山河的炮声，表示了中国人民对美帝国主义的蔑视和鄙视，表示了我们极度的愤怒和抗议！简单明白的一句话：伟大的中国人民是不可侮的！美帝国主义如果再不停止它对中国人民的挑衅活动，如果不从台湾滚出去，那末，一切严重的后果都将由它承担。血债是要用血来偿还的！帝国主义耀武扬威的旧时代已经一去不复返了！
    黄炎培强调地说，台湾是中国神圣领土不可分割的一部分。台湾问题的解决，是中国的内政，美帝国主义无权干涉。中华人民共和国政府已经一再作了庄严的声明，并且得到全世界人民的公认和支持。今天艾森豪威尔满怀鬼胎地来到台湾，不论他搞这样或那样的阴谋，都是中国人民所绝对不能容许的。中国人民一定要而且有力量粉碎这些阴谋。
    黄炎培说，台湾人民有着光荣的革命传统。台湾人民过去反抗日本帝国主义的残暴压榨，英勇不屈，五十年如一日；十三年前的2月28日，台湾人民也反抗过国民党反动派的暴政；三年前的5月24日，台湾人民为了抗议刘自然的被杀，曾经捣毁了美国大使馆。祖国人民为他们每一次光荣的斗争而欢呼。现在艾森豪威尔这个“瘟神”亲自来了。他是抱着进一步奴役亚洲人民的罪恶企图而来的，他是为了永久霸占台湾而来的。菲律宾人民已经给了他一记耳光。日本人民给了他一记更响亮的耳光。十年来，台湾人民身受美帝国主义军事上的侵略，政治上的控制，经济上的掠夺和文化上的毒害，台湾人民决不能轻轻饶过艾森豪威尔这个“瘟神”。
    他最后说，我们中国民主建国会全体成员，一定要同全国人民一道紧紧地团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，为反对美帝国主义的严重挑衅和阴谋活动，为解放台湾，为保卫世界和平而奋斗到底！
