    Happiness Road

    One morning after a sudden rain, we traveled along the wide road to the southern suburbs of Luohe City to visit the longest local railway in Henan Province – the Luohe-Wuyang Railway.

    The Luohe-Wuyang Railway was not unfamiliar to us. In December 1959, when this railway was just completed, we came here to visit. This railway starts from the southern suburbs of Luohe City, passes through Yancheng County to Tieshan in Wuyang County, with a total length of 120 li. The tracks and carriages were all manufactured by local machinery factories. It undertakes the transportation of materials for the three steel plants in Luohe, Yancheng, and Wuyang, as well as the urban and rural areas of Luohe County, Yancheng County, and Wuyang County. At that time, because it had just been completed and had not yet started operating, there was nothing except the empty station buildings, freight yards, and a few workers setting up telephone lines along the line. Now, more than five months have passed, what has it become like, and what impact has it had on industrial and agricultural production?

    When we came here again with excitement, we were immediately attracted by the busy transportation scene here. On that straight railway, two small locomotives pulled thirty-seven carriages, running back and forth day and night at a speed of 24 li per hour. Goods piled up like mountains everywhere at the stations; large quantities of cotton, tobacco leaves, and ore were being shipped out; chemical fertilizers, pesticides, coal, agricultural tools, and daily necessities needed by the countryside were also constantly being shipped in from other places. The station building was even more lively, with people coming to transport goods and take trains, bustling and flowing endlessly. Now, trains run day and night on this railway line, with a daily transportation volume of 400 tons, equivalent to the transportation volume of 57 cars, and the freight rate is 40% lower than that of cars.

    From Luohe to Tieshan in Wuyang, there is a vast plain. In the past, due to inconvenient transportation, agricultural products and daily necessities here relied on animal power for transportation. From Wuyang and Yancheng counties to Luohe City, it was dozens of li for the near and more than a hundred li for the far, and it took several days to transport by ox cart. Some communes had large quantities of agricultural products accumulated for years and could not be shipped out. Some communes could not transport kerosene, so they had to use hemp stalks for lighting during meetings and studies at night. Some communes also used trees, tobacco stalks, and cotton stalks to burn boilers because they could not transport coal. After the railway opened to traffic, the situation changed greatly. Rural long-distance transportation has been completely replaced by trains. Many agricultural products were quickly shipped out from here in a steady stream, and many daily necessities were quickly shipped in from other places. Wucheng People's Commune in Wuyang County, which had always had inconvenient transportation in the past, not only completed the task of transferring agricultural products in 1959 within twenty days after the opening of traffic, but also transferred out more than 300,000 catties of cotton accumulated in 1958 and transported in the coal, chemical fertilizers, tools, and daily necessities they needed. In mid-April this year, just when spring sowing was in full swing, suddenly more than 10,000 mu of wheat was infected with red spiders and wheat midges, requiring tens of thousands of catties of pesticides to be eliminated. If ox carts were used to transport them from Luohe, sixty li away, it would take three days for a round trip, which would not only affect the completion of the spring sowing task, but also cause great losses to the wheat. Just as everyone was in trouble, the train happened to transport more than 100,000 catties of pesticides. The entire commune organized more than 8,000 people and sprayed the wheat with pesticides three times in a row, and quickly eliminated all pests and diseases.

    This railway not only shortened the distance between urban and rural areas along the line, but also connected steel plants and mining bases. In the past, the ore used by the Luohe and Yancheng steel plants built near the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway had to be transported to Tieshan, while the coal used for iron smelting by the Wuyang steel plant had to be transported from Pingdingshan via Luohe. Between Luohe and Tieshan, although more than 40 cars ran every day, the small blast furnaces were still often in a state of hunger; the situation was even more serious in rainy weather. In June last year, there were four consecutive days of heavy rain here, the highway was impassable, and the coal in the Wuyang steel plant was about to run out. The factory party committee immediately mobilized hundreds of workers from various workshops to find coal in places thirty to forty li away in the pouring rain, and made a two-day and one-night raid, transporting more than 100 tons of coal, so that the small blast furnace did not stop production. From then on, the factory assigned special personnel to listen to weather forecasts and organized a commando team of more than 300 people to carry out rush transportation. Now, regardless of sunny or rainy days, small trains transport large quantities of ore and coal to various steel plants every day, so that the small blast furnaces are not only full, but also have more than five days of reserves. The employees happily sang: The small train is really good, running back and forth day and night, completely eliminating manual labor, and not worrying about rain or snow. Now, these steel plants are actively building blast furnaces according to the railway transportation capacity; this year, five small blast furnaces with a volume of 13 to 28 cubic meters have been built and put into production, and some have also expanded power generation, coking, and machine repair workshops.

    The opening of the Luohe-Wuyang Railway has also brought great convenience to the masses along the line. Now, commune cadres can take the train to the county town to attend meetings, workers can take the train to the factory to work, and commune members can take the train to visit relatives in other places; old people who have not been out for many years can also come out to see the world and broaden their horizons.

    The Luohe-Wuyang Railway has brought so many benefits to the people, but the railway employees are not satisfied with this. In order to further improve the railway's transportation capacity, they launched a technical revolution movement throughout the railway. Zhang Qun, a worker at the Luohe Station, saw that four workers were struggling to move the switch by hand, and sometimes the locomotive derailed because the switch was not moved properly. He thought: It would be great to be able to manufacture a switch mover like the foreign railways! He and Technician Ye studied and designed it, failed, and continued to study, and finally successfully tested the switch mover. Using this switch mover to move the switch is both labor-saving and safe. The successful trial of the native switch mover greatly encouraged the workers' confidence in invention and creation. Then, carpenter Liu Maoan and two workers used a waterwheel and a water tank to make a native water tower. In the past, it took two hours to supply water to the locomotive once, but now it only takes 20 minutes, and the efficiency has increased five times. They also used native methods to make winches, railway switches, switch indicators, and siding signals. Now these devices have been installed and put into use in various stations, which has played a great role in accelerating vehicle turnover and ensuring the safe operation of trains.

    Now, the employees of the Luohe-Wuyang Railway are rushing to build cars, build garages and locomotive repair shops, and the beautification work of various workshops is also underway. The railway is full of a thriving scene.

    幸福路
    在一个骤雨初歇的早晨，我们沿着宽阔的马路到漯河市南郊去访问河南省最长的一条地方铁路——漯舞铁路。
    漯舞铁路对我们来说并不是陌生的。1959年12月，这条铁路刚刚建成的时候，我们就曾到这里来参观过。这条铁路从漯河市的南郊起，穿过郾城县到舞阳县的铁山，全长一百二十里，轨道和车厢都是当地机械厂制造的。它担负着漯河、郾城、舞阳三个钢铁厂和漯河县、郾城县、舞阳县城乡物资运输任务。当时，由于刚刚建成，还没有开始营业，除了沿线空荡荡的站房、货场和三三两两正在架电话线的工人外，什么都没有。现在，时隔五个多月了，它变得怎样了，给工农业生产带来了什么影响呢？
    当我们怀着激动的心情又来到这里的时候，立刻被这里繁忙的运输情景吸引住了。在那平直的铁路上，两台小机车牵引着三十七个车厢，以每小时二十四里的速度，不分昼夜地来回奔跑着。各车站到处货物堆积如山；大批的棉花、烟叶、矿石正源源外运；农村需要的化肥、农药、煤炭、农具和日用品等也不断从外地运来。站房里更是热闹非凡，前来运货和乘车的人们，熙熙攘攘，络绎不绝。现在，火车在这条铁路线上，昼夜行驶，日运量达四百吨，相当于五十七辆汽车的运量，运价比汽车低40％。
    从漯河到舞阳的铁山，是一片广阔的大平原。过去，由于交通不便，这里的农产品和生活用品都是依靠畜力来运。从舞阳、郾城两县到漯河市，近则数十里，远则百余里，用牛车运输，来回一次需要好几天。有的公社大批的农产品连年积压运不出去。有的公社运不来煤油，夜晚开会、学习只得用麻秆照明。还有的公社因为运不来煤炭，就用树木、烟秆、棉秆烧锅。铁路通车以后，情况就大大改变了。农村的长途运输已经完全由火车来代替。许多农产品很快的从这里源源运出，许多生活用品迅速从外地运进。过去一向运输不便的舞阳县吴城人民公社，在通车后二十天内，不仅完成了1959年农产品的上调任务，而且还调出了1958年积压的三十多万斤棉花和运进了他们需要的煤炭、化肥、工具和日用品。今年4月中旬，正当春播紧张的时候，突然有一万多亩麦子生了红蜘蛛和吸浆虫，需要数万斤农药才能消灭净。如果用牛车到六十里外的漯河去运，往返得三天，这不仅影响春播任务的完成，而且麦子要受到很大损失。大家正在为难的时候，恰巧火车运来了十几万斤农药。全社组织了八千多人，一连给麦子打了三次农药，很快就把病虫害全部消灭了。
    这条铁路不仅缩短了沿线城乡的距离，而且还把钢铁厂和矿山基地连结了起来。以往，建立在京广铁路附近的漯河和郾城钢铁厂所用的矿石，必须到铁山去运，而舞阳钢铁厂的炼铁用煤，却要从平顶山经漯河运来。在漯河和铁山之间，每天虽然有四十多辆汽车奔跑，小高炉仍然经常处在饥饿状态；一遇阴天下雨，情况更严重。在去年6月，这里一连下了四天大雨，公路不通，舞阳钢铁厂的煤炭眼看就要用完，厂党委马上从各个车间动员了数百名工人，冒着大雨，到三、四十里外的地方去找煤，一连突击了两天一夜，运来了一百多吨煤炭，小高炉才没有停止生产。从这以后，这个厂就指定专人收听天气预报，并组织了三百多人的突击队，以便进行抢运。现在，不管晴天下雨，小火车每天将大批的矿石、煤炭分别送到各钢铁厂，使小高炉不仅吃得饱，而且还有五天以上的储备量。职工们高兴地唱道：小火车真正好，昼夜不停来回跑，肩挑人抬全取消，下雨下雪不心焦。现在，这些钢铁厂正根据铁路运输能力，积极兴建高炉；今年已经有五个十三到二十八立方米的小高炉建成并投入了生产，有的还扩建了发电、炼焦和机修等车间。
    漯舞铁路建成通车，还给沿线群众带来了很大的方便。现在，公社干部能坐上火车到县城里去开会，工人们能坐上火车到工厂里去上班，社员们能坐上火车到外地去探望亲人；多少年不出门的老人们也能出来见见世面，开开眼界了。
    漯舞铁路给人们带来了这么多的好处，但是，铁路的职工们并没有以此为满足。他们为了进一步提高铁路的运输能力，在全路范围内掀起了一个技术革命运动。漯河车站的工人张群收看到四个工人用手搬道岔非常吃力，有时由于道岔没搬好，机车掉了道。他想：能够跟洋铁路一样，制造个搬道器多好啊！他就和叶技术员研究、设计，失败了，继续研究，终于把搬道器试验成功了。用这种搬道器搬道岔，既省力又安全。土搬道器的试验成功，大大鼓舞了工人们发明创造的信心，接着木工刘茂安和两个工人用一架水车和一个水柜又制成了土水塔。过去给机车上一次水，需要两个小时，现在只要二十分钟就够了，效率提高了五倍。他们还用土法制成了卷扬机、铁道岔、道岔表示器和壁板信号等设备。现在这些设备已在各个车站安装起来开始使用，对加快车辆周转，保证列车安全行驶都起了很大的作用。
    现在，漯舞铁路的职工们正在赶制车皮，修建车库和机车修配厂，各车间的美化工作也正在着手进行，铁路上到处充满了一片欣欣向荣的景象。
