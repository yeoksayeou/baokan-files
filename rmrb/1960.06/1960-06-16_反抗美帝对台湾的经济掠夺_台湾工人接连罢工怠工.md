Xinhua News Agency, June 15th, Taipei dispatch: A wave of anti-American struggle is surging among Taiwanese workers. Recently, multiple anti-American incidents involving strikes and work slowdowns have occurred, resisting the economic plunder of Taiwan by American imperialism and protesting the crimes of American capitalists in cruelly oppressing and exploiting Taiwanese workers.

According to reports from Taiwan's "Credit News," "Kung Lun Pao," and "China Evening News," this strong anti-American struggle wave among Taiwanese workers first occurred at the American-owned "Asia Air Survey Company" in Tainan City. In April, the company's American deputy manager, Weiss Tee, withheld workers' wages, arbitrarily insulted and injured Taiwanese workers Cai Jianhai and Zeng Binghui, and forcibly fired twenty-seven workers, including Gao Deshuo, Cai Jianhai, and Zeng Binghui. This aroused great indignation among the company's more than two thousand Taiwanese workers. In the past month or so, they have continuously carried out multiple work slowdowns and strike struggles. At the same time, with the support of all workers and the people of Tainan City, Gao Deshuo and others held a press conference, angrily exposing and denouncing the crimes of American imperialism. On the morning of June 1st, they collectively lay down in front of the company's automobile warehouse, blocking transportation to show their anger and protest, demanding that the Americans admit their guilt, immediately pay back wages, and allow them to return to work. Their heroic and reasonable struggle has received increasing support from people from all walks of life in Taiwan. The struggle is still ongoing.

Taiwan's "Credit News" reported that following the anti-American struggle of workers at "Asia Air Survey Company," more than one thousand Taiwanese employees of the Taiwan Shipbuilding Corporation in Keelung City also held their third major strike in nearly three years on June 2nd. This shipbuilding company was taken over by the American Ingalls Shipbuilding Corporation in February 1957. The workers have always harbored anger towards the American aggressors, and have held two collective strikes in October 1957 and September 1959. In this strike, the workers once again strongly protested the American capitalists' crimes of annexing the shipbuilding company and bullying and humiliating workers, demanding that the Americans get out of the Taiwan Shipbuilding Corporation.

Taiwanese newspapers also revealed that in some factories and mines in Taipei, Kaohsiung, and other places occupied by Americans, multiple strikes and work slowdowns have also erupted recently. Taiwanese workers, who are in dire straits, are increasingly aware that American imperialism is the root of all the suffering and disasters of the Taiwanese people. They have launched an unyielding anti-American patriotic struggle, determined to drive the American devils out of Taiwan.

    反抗美帝对台湾的经济掠夺
    台湾工人接连罢工怠工
    新华社15日讯　台北消息：台湾工人掀起反美斗争浪潮，最近多次发生罢工、怠工的反美事件，反抗美帝国主义对台湾的经济掠夺，抗议美国资本家残酷压榨和剥削台湾工人的罪行。
    据台湾“征信新闻”报、“公论报”、“中国晚报”报道，台湾工人这一强烈的反美斗争浪潮，首先发生在台南市美国“亚洲航空公司”里，这个公司的副经理美国人魏思梯在4月间扣发工人工资，肆意辱骂和打伤台湾工人蔡建海、曾炳辉，并且强行解雇高德硕、蔡建海、曾炳辉等二十七名工人，激起了全公司两千多名台湾工人的极大愤慨，他们在最近一个多月以来，连续进行了多次怠工和罢工斗争。同时，高德硕等在全体工人和台南市人民的声援下，举行了记者招待会，愤怒地揭露和痛斥美帝国主义的罪行后，又在6月1日清晨，集体卧倒在公司汽车仓库门口，阻止交通运输，以示愤怒和抗议，要求美国人认罪，并且立即补发工资和允许他们复工。他们的这一英勇、合理的斗争，愈来愈得到台湾各界人民的声援和支持，现在斗争还在进行中。
    台湾“征信新闻”报说，继“亚洲航空公司”工人反美斗争之后，设在基隆市的台湾造船公司的一千多名台湾职工，也在6月2日举行了近三年来的第三次大罢工。这个造船公司是在1957年2月被美国英加尔斯造船公司吞并的。工人们一直怀着对美国侵略者的怒火，曾经在1957年10月和1959年9月举行过两次集体大罢工。这一次大罢工中，工人们再一次强烈抗议美国资本家吞并造船公司和欺凌侮辱工人的罪行，要求美国人从台湾造船公司滚出去。
    台湾报纸还透露，在台北和高雄等地美国人霸占的一些厂矿企业中，最近也接连爆发多次罢工、怠工事件。处在水深火热中的台湾工人，越来越清楚地认识到，美帝国主义是台湾人民一切痛苦和灾难的根源，他们展开不屈不挠的反美爱国斗争，决心把美国佬赶出台湾。
