    Xinhua News Agency, June 15th. The All-China Youth Federation sent a telegram to the Iraqi Democratic Youth Federation on June 14th, congratulating them on the convening of the Second Congress of the Iraqi Democratic Youth Federation.
    The telegram said: "Currently, the international situation is very favorable to the struggle of people of all countries against imperialism and its running dogs, for democratic freedom, and to defend peace. The strength of socialism has surpassed the strength of imperialism, the strength of peace has surpassed the strength of war, and the strength of the people has surpassed the strength of reaction. The storm of Asian, African, and Latin American people against U.S. imperialism has risen even more. The lifespan of imperialism will not be long. We firmly believe that Iraqi youth will continue to carry forward the revolutionary tradition, persist in the struggle, hold high the banner of anti-imperialism and democracy, and advance bravely. In your just struggle, Chinese youth will always be your loyal friends."
