Xinhua News Agency, 15th. The Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Chinese Dramatists Association, Chinese Musicians Association, Chinese Dance Research Association, and China Photographic Society have recently sent telegrams to the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association and the drama, music, dance, and photography circles in Japan, resolutely supporting the Japanese people's 18th National Unified Action to demand the abolition of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi government, dissolve the Diet, and oppose Eisenhower's visit to Japan.

The Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries and the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles said in a telegram sent on the 13th to the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association and the National Council Against Revision of the Security Treaty that we Chinese cultural and art workers are extremely excited to see that the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic united front, after the "June 4th" general strike centered on the Japanese working class, has further strengthened the anti-American patriotic just struggle and achieved new victories. Japanese progressive literary and art figures have stood at the forefront of the Japanese people's struggle and made great contributions in the struggle. We firmly believe that the Japanese people's fight against U.S. imperialism and its running dog, the Nobusuke Kishi clique, will continue to move forward with the force of a thunderbolt. With the support of the people of the world, the Japanese people will surely smash the aggressive Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and will surely be able to completely drive the forces of U.S. imperialism out of Japan.

Tian Han, chairman of the Chinese Dramatists Association, and vice-chairmen Ouyang Yuqian and Mei Lanfang sent a telegram to Japanese drama figures Akita Ujaku, Takizawa Osamu, Uno Jukichi, Yamamoto Yasue, Sugimura Haruko, Chisaka Koreya, Murayama Tomoyoshi, Kinoshita Junji, Kawatazaki Chojuro, Nakamura Kanzaburo, Usuda Kenji, Miho Misami and others saying that the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic movement is like a raging tide, and we admire the Japanese drama friends who stand at the forefront of the movement and fight unyieldingly. We would like to pay our respects to you on behalf of the Chinese drama community, and we fully support you. Final victory will surely belong to you.

Lü Ji, chairman of the Chinese Musicians Association, said in a telegram to the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association forwarding it to the Democratic Musicians Association that the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs to revive Japanese militarism and plot new wars has been fully exposed. We believe that the Japanese people, who have been deeply tempered by the eighteen national unified actions and are becoming increasingly closely united, will ignite greater anger against U.S. imperialism, oppose Eisenhower's visit to Japan, and fight to further smash the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. As long as the Japanese people resolutely launch a broad mass struggle, no matter how many difficulties they encounter, they will eventually achieve final victory.

The Chinese Dance Research Association said in a telegram sent to Japanese dance friends on the 14th that all Chinese dance workers and all Chinese people stand forever on the side of the Japanese people and unswervingly and resolutely support your just struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dog, the Nobusuke Kishi clique. In a telegram sent to the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association forwarding it to the Japan Photographers Association, the China Photographic Society expressed its sincere respect and firm support to the Japanese photography community, which stands at the forefront of the anti-American patriotic just struggle, using photography as a weapon, and actively encouraging the people's struggle.
