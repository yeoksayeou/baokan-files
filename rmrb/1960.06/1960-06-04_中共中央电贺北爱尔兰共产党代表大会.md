Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The Congress of the Communist Party of Northern Ireland will open in Belfast on the 4th. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China specially sent a telegram of congratulations. The full text of the congratulatory telegram is as follows:

To the esteemed delegates of the Congress of the Communist Party of Northern Ireland:

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, on behalf of all its members and the entire Chinese people, extends warm congratulations to the Congress of the Communist Party of Northern Ireland, and through you, extends cordial greetings to all members of the Communist Party of Northern Ireland and the working class and all working people of Northern Ireland.

The Communist Party of Northern Ireland is the vanguard of the working class of Northern Ireland, and it has persistently struggled to safeguard the vital interests of the working people of Northern Ireland and to realize socialism.

The development of the current international situation is favorable to the struggles of the people of all countries. The strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is growing, the struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism and for national independence and freedom are becoming more intense, and the struggles of the working people in capitalist countries to defend peace, strive for democracy, and strive for socialism are also constantly developing. At the same time, the imperialist camp is showing greater difficulties and isolation, rotting away day by day. The life of imperialism will not be long, but the imperialists are not willing to die. The imperialist camp headed by the United States is now actively expanding its arms and preparing for war, pursuing policies of war and aggression, and recently sabotaged the four-power summit conference, continuing to intensify international tension. Faced with this situation, we constantly expose the true face of imperialism and actively lead the struggle of the masses of the people to win the victory of peace, democracy, and socialism.

We congratulate the Congress of the Communist Party of Northern Ireland on its complete success. We wish the Communist Party of Northern Ireland new achievements in uniting the working class and all working people and all progressive and democratic forces in the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism!

		The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China

    中共中央电贺北爱尔兰共产党代表大会
    新华社3日讯　北爱尔兰共产党代表大会将于4日在培尔法斯特开幕。中国共产党中央委员会特地拍电报致贺，贺电全文如下：北爱尔兰共产党代表大会亲爱的代表同志们：
    中国共产党中央委员会谨代表全体党员和全中国人民，向北爱尔兰共产党代表大会致以热烈的祝贺，并通过你们向北爱尔兰共产党全体党员和北爱尔兰工人阶级和全体劳动人民致以亲切的敬意。
    北爱尔兰共产党是北爱尔兰工人阶级的先锋队，它坚持不懈地为维护北爱尔兰劳动人民的切身利益、为实现社会主义而斗争。
    目前国际形势的发展对世界各国人民的斗争是有利的。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量日益壮大，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民反对帝国主义、争取民族独立自由的斗争愈加猛烈，资本主义国家劳动人民保卫和平，争取民主，争取社会主义的斗争也不断发展。与此同时，帝国主义阵营则表现出更加困难和孤立，一天一天地烂下去。帝国主义的寿命不会很长了，但是，帝国主义者是不甘愿死亡的。以美国为首的帝国主义阵营现在正在积极扩军备战，推行战争政策与侵略政策，最近又破坏了四国首脑会议，继续加剧国际紧张局势。面对着这种情势，我们不断地揭露帝国主义的真面目，积极地领导人民群众的斗争，争取和平、民主和社会主义的胜利。
    我们祝贺北爱尔兰共产党代表大会获得完满的成功。祝北爱尔兰共产党在团结工人阶级和全体劳动人民和一切进步民主力量为争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争中取得新的成就！
        中国共产党中央委员会
                1960年6月2日
