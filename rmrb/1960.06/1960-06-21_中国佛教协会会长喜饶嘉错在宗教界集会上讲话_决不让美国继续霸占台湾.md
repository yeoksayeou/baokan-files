Xinhua News Agency, 20th: Shirob Jaltso, President of the China Buddhist Association, spoke on the 19th at a gathering of religious figures in the capital protesting "Plague God" Eisenhower's stepping onto China's territory of Taiwan.

Shirob Jaltso said that war-monger and "Plague God" Eisenhower traveled across the ocean to "visit" the Far East, making an utter fool of himself in recent days. He has become a rat scurrying across the street after being beaten black and blue. Yesterday, he scurried in a wretched state, dragging his long tail, into our territory of Taiwan, stirring up trouble in the Taiwan Strait, giving a shot in the arm to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique long rejected by the Chinese people, and attempting to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, so as to fulfill his dream of permanently occupying our Taiwan. This is a serious provocation to our people. Such a serious crime of aggression and provocation against our country has ignited the anger of all ethnic groups in the country and all peace-loving and just people in the world. With incomparable anger, I, on behalf of the Chinese Buddhist community, firmly oppose the so-called "visit" of the "Plague God" to our Taiwan; I firmly support the armed demonstration by our artillery forces on the Fujian front.

The paper tiger of U.S. imperialism is the source of world disasters, and the old demon Eisenhower is the culprit for undermining world peace. After he sabotaged the Four-Power Summit Conference, he came to the Far East to openly commit crimes amid the condemnation of people all over the world. Because he has done all kinds of bad things, tidal waves of opposition to him have been stirred up wherever he has gone. When he was a guest in the Philippines, a scapegoat had to eat stone desserts for him; the Japanese people made him taste the spicy flavor of being turned away. It's really a case of a rat crossing the street, with everyone shouting "Kill it!" Now the "Plague God" has come to our territory of Taiwan. Our patriotic compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, you certainly will not allow the "Plague God" to swagger and bluster over your heads.

He said: Patriotic compatriots in Taiwan, you have 650 million compatriots as your backing, and peace-loving people all over the world as your support. Your just struggle against the U.S. and for patriotism will surely achieve brilliant victory.

Shirob Jaltso said that U.S. imperialism has been plotting "Taiwan autonomy" and creating opposition factions. One day, the United States will stage its specialty show of "cooking the running dog." The Americans will not talk about loyalty to their faithful running dogs. The fate of syngman rhee, manders, and the like is the inevitable result of being a running dog. He said that patriotism does not distinguish between early and late, and rewards and punishments have precedents. The people on the mainland of the motherland are willing to see the military and political personnel in Taiwan quickly wash their hands and return from their errors.

He said: Taiwan is an inseparable part of our territory, and the people of Taiwan are flesh and blood in our big family of nationalities. Since the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique was driven out of the mainland by the Chinese people and occupied Taiwan, Taiwan has been barbarously occupied by U.S. imperialists, and the people of all ethnic groups in Taiwan have lived a life of deep suffering in hell under the cruel oppression, exploitation, bullying, and humiliation of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique and U.S. imperialism. We brothers and sisters who live in the happy and bright socialist motherland on the mainland always cherish the brothers and sisters who are suffering in Taiwan, and are always ready to liberate the brothers and sisters in Taiwan from the sea of suffering, and jointly build a great socialist motherland and enjoy a happy and bright life together.

Shirob Jaltso said that now, U.S. imperialism is still occupying our territory of Taiwan, and Eisenhower has come to Taiwan to spread his plague and poison. We want to warn this dizzy-headed "Plague God" to wake up: the powerful People's Republic of China and its heroic people will liberate Taiwan, and will certainly be able to liberate Taiwan. We will never let these monsters and demons continue to occupy our territory. For the sake of the "Plague God," of the thirty-six strategems, running away is the best one. Now that you have come from afar, the hospitable Chinese people have held an "arrival and departure banquet" for the "Plague God" with a salvo of artillery fire to express our contempt and scorn, which will make the "Plague God"'s soul fly together with the shells, and let God summon your soul.

    中国佛教协会会长喜饶嘉错在宗教界集会上讲话
    决不让美国继续霸占台湾
    新华社20日讯　中国佛教协会会长喜饶嘉错19日在首都宗教界人士抗议“瘟神”艾森豪威尔踏上我国领土台湾的集会上讲了话。
    喜饶嘉错说，战争贩子艾森豪威尔“瘟神”远涉重洋“访问”远东，最近几天出尽了天下之大丑，变成了一只被打得遍体鳞伤的过街耗子，昨天他狼狈万状地拖着一条长尾巴窜进了我国的领土台湾，在台湾海峡兴风作浪，给中国人民久已唾弃的僵尸蒋介石卖国集团打强心针，并且妄图阻止中国人民解放台湾，以遂其永久霸占我国台湾的梦想，这是对我国人民的严重挑衅。这种对我国的严重侵略和挑衅罪行，已经燃起了全国各族人民和世界上一切爱好和平、正义的人民的怒火。我以无比愤怒的心情，代表中国佛教界对“瘟神”在我国台湾的所谓“访问”坚决表示反对；对我福建前线炮兵部队的武装示威坚决表示拥护。
    纸老虎美帝国主义者是制造世界灾难的根源，老妖魔艾森豪威尔是破坏世界和平的祸首。他在破坏四大国首脑会议后，又在全世界人民一片责骂声中，来远东公开做案。由于他做尽了坏事，所到之处，都掀起了反对他的朝天浪潮，当他在菲律宾作客时，一个替死鬼代他饱餐了石头点心；日本人民又请他饱尝了闭门羹的辛辣味；真是耗子过街、人人喊打。现在“瘟神”来到了我国领土台湾，我台、澎、金、马的爱国同胞们，你们当然不甘让“瘟神”在你们头上耀武扬威。
    他说：台湾的爱国同胞们，你们有六亿五千万同胞作后盾，有全世界爱好和平的人民作后盾，你们反美爱国的正义斗争，一定能够获得辉煌的胜利。
    喜饶嘉错说，美帝国主义一直策动在“台湾自治”，制造反对派。有朝一日，美国会演出“烹走狗”的拿手戏的。美国人不会对他的忠实走狗讲什么义气的，李承晚、曼德列斯之流的下场，就是当走狗的必然结果。他说，爱国不分先后，奖惩自有前例，祖国大陆上的人民，是愿意看见台湾军政人员快点洗手、迷途知返的。
    他说：台湾是我国领土不可分割的一部分，台湾人民是我国各民族大家庭中的骨肉。自蒋介石反动集团被中国人民逐出大陆窃踞台湾以来，台湾就一直为美帝国主义者所野蛮霸占，台湾各族人民在蒋介石反动集团和美帝国主义的残酷压迫剥削和欺侮凌辱下，过着灾难深重的地狱生活。我们生活在幸福光明的社会主义祖国大陆上的弟兄们，时刻怀念着在台湾受难的弟兄们，时刻准备着解放台湾的弟兄们脱离苦海，和我们共同建设伟大的社会主义祖国，共同享受幸福光明的生活。
    喜饶嘉错说，现在，美帝国主义还霸占着我国的领土台湾，艾森豪威尔还到台湾施瘟降毒，我们要警告这位头脑发昏的“瘟神”清醒一下：强大的中华人民共和国和它的英雄人民一定要解放台湾，也一定能解放台湾。决不让这些牛鬼蛇神继续霸占我国的领土。为“瘟神”计，三十六计，滚为上计。现在你既远道而来，好客的中国人民以万炮齐发的武装示威为“瘟神”举行了表示我们蔑视和鄙视心情的“迎送宴”，它将打得“瘟神”魂魄与炮弹齐飞，让上帝去给你招魂吧。
