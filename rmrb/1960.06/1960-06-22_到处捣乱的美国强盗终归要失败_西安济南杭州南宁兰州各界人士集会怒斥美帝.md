    Steadfastly Fight American Imperialism to the End
    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 21st – Responsible persons from local organizations of various democratic parties and people's organizations, as well as non-party democratic individuals in Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City, held a rally on the afternoon of the 20th to angrily condemn the "plague god" Eisenhower for planning aggression and war preparations in the Far East, expressing their determination to fight American imperialism to the end.
    Chang Lifu, Vice Chairman of the Shaanxi Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, said at the meeting that the head war monger Eisenhower's trip to the Far East, under the firm opposition of the Chinese people and the Asian people, failed to achieve his despicable goals, which further revealed the paper tiger nature of American imperialism. We must strengthen solidarity and mutual support with the people of Asia and the peace-loving people of the world, and carry the struggle against American imperialism to the end.
    Wu Shalang, Vice Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, said that the embarrassing situation encountered by the "plague god" Eisenhower during his trip to the Far East shows that the era of imperialism running rampant and doing whatever it wants in Asia is gone forever. Yuan Zhengting, Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, said that the powerful storm against American imperialism and its running dogs currently being set off by the people of Asian countries has placed the head of imperialism, Eisenhower, in a situation of being beaten everywhere and unprecedentedly isolated, like a rat crossing the street. As long as the people unite and wage a resolute struggle, they will surely be able to defeat all their conspiracies. Wang Juren, Vice Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, in his speech, expressed his hope that military and political personnel in Taiwan would recognize the future, unite as one, and work with the people of the whole country to drive American imperialism out of Taiwan. Han Wangchen, Chairman of the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, said that the most ferocious enemy of world peace, the war "plague god" Eisenhower, is a butcher stained with the blood of the people, and no matter what conspiracies and tricks he plays, he cannot deceive the Asian people and the people of the world.
    Responsible persons from the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Shaanxi Provincial Women's Federation also spoke at the meeting.

    Li Chengzhi, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang and Vice Chairman of the Provincial Political Consultative Conference, said that the action of our Fujian Front troops firing a barrage of artillery to "welcome" and "send off" the "plague god" Eisenhower fully expresses the wishes of our people. He sternly condemned Eisenhower's conspiracy to create "two Chinas," saying that the Chinese people resolutely oppose this sinful activity of American imperialism and will fight to the end against American imperialism's wars and aggressive schemes. The Chinese people's will to liberate our territory of Taiwan is unshakable, and he hopes that the patriotic compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu will unite closely with the people of the whole country and strive to drive American imperialism out of Taiwan.
    Zhang Weicen, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Working Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, Liu Minsheng, a non-party democratic individual and Vice Chairman of the Provincial Political Consultative Conference, Miao Hainan, Chairman of the Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce and Vice Chairman of the Provincial Political Consultative Conference, Huang Yunmei, Chairman of the Jinan Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League and Vice Chairman of the Municipal Political Consultative Conference, and Xu Meisheng, Chairman of the Jinan Branch of the Jiusan Society, also spoke at the meeting.

    Wu Shanmin, Vice Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, said that the fact that the American imperialist boss Eisenhower climbed onto our sacred territory of Taiwan is a serious provocation to the 650 million Chinese people who have stood up, and we express our strongest protest and condemnation. We will absolutely not allow the American imperialist conspiracy to create "two Chinas" to succeed, and we must liberate Taiwan. Li Maozhi, Vice Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, said that Taiwan is an inseparable part of our country's territory, and we will never allow the American imperialist conspiracy to permanently occupy Taiwan to succeed. Tang Xunze, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Working Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, said that the great Chinese people are not to be insulted, and American imperialism must stop its shameless provocations against the Chinese people and get out of our territory of Taiwan.
    Shen Ce, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, said that the workers of Zhejiang Province resolutely support the just struggles of the people of Japan, Korea, and all of Asia, and resolutely work together with the people of Asia and the world to overthrow American imperialism.
    Responsible persons from the Zhejiang Provincial Women's Federation, the Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the Zhejiang Branch of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions all issued statements severely condemning Eisenhower's war provocations in Taiwan.
          The People's Just Struggle Will Inevitably Accelerate the Demise of American Imperialism
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 21st – The war "plague god" Eisenhower's robber trip to the Far East has angered the people of all ethnic groups in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. On the morning of the 20th, local organizations of various democratic parties and non-party democratic individuals in the autonomous region held a protest rally. Li Renren, Chairman of the Autonomous Region Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, said: The Chinese people will never allow the American imperialist conspiracy to permanently occupy our territory of Taiwan to be realized. The artillery fire of the People's Liberation Army troops on the Fujian front expresses the will of our 650 million people to resolutely liberate Taiwan. Mo Naiqun, Vice Chairman of the Autonomous Region Branch of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and Chairman of the Autonomous Region Committee of the China Democratic League, said that the "visit" of the war "plague god" Eisenhower to the Far East has resulted in an increasingly high tide of Asian people opposing American imperialist aggression. The Asian people will use more resolute struggles to thoroughly defeat American imperialism's aggression and war policies. Qiu Chen, Vice Chairman of the Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Chairman of the Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, said that the just struggles of the Asian people and the people of the world will inevitably accelerate the demise of American imperialism. Lu Rongshu, Vice Chairman of the Nanning Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Vice Chairman of the Autonomous Region Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party, said that the "plague god" Eisenhower's experience in the Far East this time vividly shows that American imperialism is becoming increasingly isolated, and its true face is being exposed by more and more people.
            Absolutely Cannot Tolerate the War Plague God's Provocative Behavior
    Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 21st – Responsible persons from local organizations of various democratic parties and people from all walks of life in Gansu Province gathered on the 20th to strongly condemn the "plague god" Eisenhower's robber trip to the Far East and the provocative act of climbing onto our sacred territory of Taiwan, and warmly support the anti-American armed demonstration by the People's Liberation Army Fujian Front troops. They unanimously expressed: We must liberate Taiwan, and American imperialism must get out of Taiwan.
    Huang Zhengqing (Tibetan), Vice Chairman of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said at the meeting that after destroying the four-nation summit conference, the plague god Eisenhower shamelessly came to our territory of Taiwan to plan new aggressive activities, attempting to create the conspiracy of "two Chinas". This is an intolerable provocative act against the 650 million Chinese people and fully exposes that American imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the Chinese and peace-loving people of the world. He also said that our heroic artillery units of the People's Liberation Army Fujian Front firing artillery to "welcome" and "send off" the number one war monger Eisenhower fully expresses the angry feelings of the people of all ethnic groups in our country and represents the serious protest of the people of all ethnic groups in our country against the aggressive crimes of American imperialism.
    Deng Baoshan, Chairman of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, and Wu Hongbin, Chairman of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, also strongly condemned Eisenhower's robber trip in their speeches and warmly supported the anti-American armed demonstration held by our army on the Fujian front.
