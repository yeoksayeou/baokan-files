Xinhua News Agency, June 12th Dispatch from New Delhi: Some Indian newspapers are openly flattering American imperialism and slandering the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle. The "Indian Express," in its editorial on the 10th, described Eisenhower, a rat everyone shouts at and beats, as a "great politician who has been playing a role in strengthening the forces of peace for the past seven years," calling him a "leader of peace," and whitewashed his upcoming visit to Japan as a "goodwill visit." This newspaper even described the Japanese people's patriotic actions against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and Eisenhower's visit to Japan as "unfortunate demonstrations with some misunderstanding." This newspaper actually cheered for Kishi Nobusuke, saying that Kishi Nobusuke might be able to guarantee control of the people's demonstrations and ensure that the visit will proceed smoothly. This newspaper also complained that Kishi Nobusuke could not organize a "warm and spontaneous welcome" for Eisenhower.

The "Hindustan Times" even demanded that the Japanese people unanimously welcome the "great guest" it recognizes, and said that not doing so would be "unfortunate."

The Hindi "New India Times" on June 8th even used "Communist movement" as an excuse to undermine the Japanese people's struggle against the aggressive U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and against U.S. imperialism. It said that "if Japan suddenly opposes the United States under the propaganda of the Communist bloc, it will not only be dangerous for Japan, but also dangerous for the whole of Asia."

    印度三家报纸向美帝国主义献媚
    要岸信介保证制止人民示威
    说反美对整个亚洲是危险的
    新华社12日讯　新德里消息：印度一些报纸公然向美帝国主义献媚并诬蔑日本人民的反美爱国斗争。“印度快报”在10日的社论中把艾森豪威尔这只人人喊打的过街老鼠说成是“七年来一直对加强和平力量起着作用的伟大政治家”，称他是“和平的领袖”，并粉饰他即将对日本的访问是“亲善访问”。这家报纸还把日本人民反对新日美“安全条约”和艾森豪威尔访问日本的爱国行动说成是“带有某种误解的不幸的示威”。这家报纸居然为岸信介打气说，岸信介也许能够保证控制住人民的示威，保证这次访问将顺利进行。这家报纸还抱怨岸信介不能为艾森豪威尔组织“热烈而自发的欢迎”。
    “印度斯坦日报”居然要日本人民一致地来欢迎它认为的这位“伟大的客人”，而且说什么不这样做将是“不幸的”。
    6月8日的印地文“新印度时报”竟以“共产党运动”为借口，来破坏日本人民反对侵略性的日美军事同盟条约、反对美帝国主义的斗争。它说什么，“如果日本在共产党集团的宣传下突然反对美国，那末这不但对日本是危险的，就是对于整个亚洲也是危险的”。
