    Yang Fengyun Persists on the Front Lines for Four Years
    Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 10th. Yang Fengyun, the Party Secretary of the Changsha Power Plant in Hunan Province, has consistently gone deep into the front lines of production for more than four years, participating in and leading production. This has enabled the plant to consistently overfulfill its power generation tasks each month, reduce coal consumption month by month, and be repeatedly recognized as a red banner unit for sustained leaps forward in the provincial, municipal, and national power industry systems for several consecutive years. Comrade Yang Fengyun has also been recognized as an advanced worker in Changsha City.
    Since Comrade Yang Fengyun came to the Changsha Power Plant in 1956, he has rarely sat in the office except for meeting times. He chose the Ding Shift of the Operations Workshop as his experimental plot. The plant's experience in using old rice husks instead of coal for power generation was successfully tested by Comrade Yang Fengyun in this shift using the "three-way combination" method. In order to generate more electricity and ensure safe power generation, he also worked with the workers of this shift to conduct experiments to increase output. After more than a week of repeated exploration and experimentation, the output of the generator was increased by 500 kilowatts on the original basis. He is not only good at creating, but also pays great attention to summarizing advanced experiences. In the past year or so, he has summarized three or four sets of experiences, including methods for preventing abnormal operation, complete trial burning of old rice husks, and the leadership work of the work teams. These were quickly promoted and used throughout the plant by holding on-site meetings, organizing observations, and technical demonstrations.
    Comrade Yang Fengyun goes deep into the grassroots, grasping ideological mobilization work on one hand and the key points in production on the other, organizing the masses to continuously move forward. After the plant completed its May power generation target eight days ahead of schedule, Yang Fengyun insisted on going deep into the workshops to focus on key areas during the major battle in June. Recently, due to the hot weather and high water temperature, the vacuum decreased and the generator temperature increased, affecting power generation output. He and the members of the plant's Party Committee went deep into the operations workshops to focus on the key to increasing power generation. For the past few days, he has often stayed in the workshop with workers and technicians, and finally broke through this key point. The power generation in the first five days of June has increased by about 10% compared to the average power generation level in late May.

    和群众一起创造先进经验一起解决关键问题
    杨峰云四年坚持在第一线
    本报长沙10日电　湖南省长沙发电厂党委书记杨峰云同志，四年多来一直坚持深入生产第一线，参加生产领导生产，使这个厂保持了月月超额完成发电任务，煤耗月月下降，连续几年被评为省、市和全国电业系统持续跃进的红旗单位。杨峰云同志也被评为长沙市的先进工作者。
    1956年杨峰云同志来到长沙发电厂后，除了开会时间，他极少坐在办公室里。他选择了运行车间的丁班作为自己的试验田。这个厂创造的用老糠代替煤炭发电的经验，就是杨峰云同志在这个班用三结合的方法试验成功的。为了多发电、安全发电，他还和这个班的工人一道作提高出力的试验。经过一个多星期的反复摸索和试验，使发电机的出力在原有基础上提高了五百瓩的发电能力。他不仅善于创造，而且还十分注意总结先进经验。在最近一年多的时间内，就总结了异常运行防止办法、全部试烧老糠和班组的领导工作等三四套经验。通过召开现场会、组织观摩和技术表演等办法，迅速在全厂推广使用。
    杨峰云同志深入基层，一手抓思想发动工作，一手抓生产中的关键，组织群众不断前进。这个厂提前八天完成5月份发电量以后，在大战6月中，杨峰云又坚持深入车间抓关键。近来由于天气热、水温高，真空下降，发电机温度高，影响发电出力；他便和厂党委委员们一道，深入到运行车间狠抓提高发电量关键。几天来，他经常守在车间和工人技术员一道，终于突破了这个关键，6月份头五天的发电量，又比5月下旬平均发电水平提高10％左右。
