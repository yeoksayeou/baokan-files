Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 13th. A group of Overseas Chinese from the Surabaya area of East Java, Indonesia, arrived in Shantou on the "Da Bao An" ship on the 10th. The majority of them were forced to return to the motherland with their families because they could no longer make a living due to persecution by powerful groups in Indonesia.

The returning Overseas Chinese received a warm welcome upon their arrival at Shantou Port. Jiang Jinzhu, a female returning Overseas Chinese, gave birth to a child on the ship and was immediately taken to a hospital for recuperation after going ashore. Her husband, Guo Tianwen, said with emotion, "I suffered persecution and unemployment in Indonesia for half a year, and my family of five had no means of support. Now that I have returned to the motherland, I feel boundless warmth. I will do my best to contribute all my strength to the socialist construction of the motherland."

The returning Overseas Chinese angrily exposed the Indonesian authorities' insults and harassment towards them. Before returning to China, almost all of them were forced to put on one or two hundred fingerprints. Returning Overseas Chinese, Shen Shaohua, said, "I ran to thirteen agencies in total and was forced to put on two hundred and twenty-four handprints, which is worse than being a criminal. This is the greatest insult to our personal dignity."

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, June 13th. More than seven hundred Overseas Chinese who suffered persecution in Indonesia returned to Fuzhou City on the 12th, and were warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life.

This group of Overseas Chinese compatriots returned from the Xinzhu Island mining area, Java Island, and Sumatra and other places in Indonesia. Xu Deting, Liu Zhang, Huang Chuo, and He Hongqing, who had been miners in the Xinzhu Island mining area for decades, were laid off in December 1959, and were displaced and unable to maintain their livelihoods. This time, they only brought a few old clothes back to the motherland. Xu Deting, who is already sixty-five years old, pulled at his lapel and said, "I have worked in Xinzhu for more than thirty years, and all I brought back was a set of single clothes and a cotton undershirt." Xiao Kaizhang, an old lady who returned from Siantar, the only thing she carried in her hand was a bamboo basket. Whenever she met welcoming relatives, she would say, "Thank Chairman Mao, I have finally returned to the motherland."

After staying in Fuzhou City for a day or two, this group of returning Overseas Chinese will settle down in the Chi'gang Overseas Chinese Farm in Putian and various factories and enterprises to participate in the socialist construction of the motherland.

    两批华侨回到祖国
    受到各界人民热烈欢迎
    新华社广州13日电　一批印度尼西亚东爪哇泗水一带的华侨，在10日乘“大宝安”号轮船抵达汕头。他们大部分是在印度尼西亚有势力集团迫害下无以为生，举家回到祖国来的。
    归侨们到达汕头港时，受到了热情的接待。女归侨江金珠在船上生了一个孩子，上岸后立即被接到医院疗养。她的丈夫郭天文感动地说，“我在印度尼西亚遭受迫害失业半年，一家五口生活无着。如今回到祖国，感到无限温暖，我一定竭尽全力为祖国的社会主义建设贡献出全部力量。”
    归侨们愤怒地揭露了印度尼西亚当局对他们的侮辱和刁难。他们回国前，几乎全被强行打上一两百个手指印。归侨申少华说：“我前后一共跑了十三个机关，总共被按上二百二十四个手模，简直比犯人还不如，这是对我们人身尊严的最大侮辱。”
    新华社福州13日电　有七百多名在印度尼西亚遭受迫害的华侨12日回到福州市，受到各界人民的热烈欢迎。
    这批侨胞是从印度尼西亚新及岛矿区、爪哇岛和苏门答腊等地回国的。在新及岛矿区作了几十年矿工的许德亭、刘章、黄辍、何鸿庆，在1959年12月被解雇后，流离失所，连生活都难以维持，这次随身带回祖国的只是几件破旧衣服。年已六十五岁的许德亭用手拉了拉自己的衣襟说：“我在新及作了三十多年，带回来的只是身上穿的一套单衣和一件棉毛衫。由先达回来的萧开章老大娘，手上提的唯一的东西就是一只竹篮子。她逢到欢迎的亲人就说：“感谢毛主席，终算回到了祖国。”
    这批归侨在福州市逗留一两天后，将分别到莆田赤港华侨农场和各工厂企业安家落户，参加祖国社会主义建设。
