Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, May 31st: Zheng Senyu's full speech at the Presidium Meeting of the World Peace Council in Stockholm on May 29th:

Friends:

At a time when U.S. imperialism single-handedly wrecked the Four-Power Summit Conference and intensified the international situation, it is of particular importance that the Presidium of the World Peace Council is holding an emergency meeting here. I am very glad to be able to attend this meeting on behalf of Mr. Guo Moruo. I believe that this meeting will surely reflect the will of peace-loving people all over the world, severely condemn U.S. imperialism's crimes of sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference and threatening world peace, firmly support the Soviet Union's solemn stance against U.S. aggression and provocation, and call on the people of the world to fight to defeat U.S. imperialism's policies of war and aggression.

On the eve of the scheduled Four-Power Summit Conference, the U.S. government sent a spy plane to invade Soviet airspace and flagrantly rejected the Soviet government's solemn protests and reasonable demands, making it impossible for the Four-Power Summit Conference to be held. This is a heinous crime committed by U.S. imperialism in its deliberate attempt to undermine world peace. The Chinese people and all peace-loving and justice-upholding people throughout the world express their utmost indignation at the crimes of U.S. imperialism. The Chinese people fully support the solemn statement issued by Soviet Premier Khrushchev on May 16 and the just and forceful accusation made by Foreign Minister Gromyko at the United Nations Security Council on May 23. This statement and accusation fully demonstrate the principled stand of the great Soviet people in safeguarding national sovereignty and opposing imperialist aggression, thoroughly expose the aggressive nature and gangster logic of U.S. imperialism, and reflect the will of the people of the powerful socialist camp to resolutely stop U.S. imperialism's war provocations and safeguard world peace. In order to oppose the crimes of U.S. imperialism and firmly support the just position of the Soviet Union, the Chinese people have held unprecedented demonstrations throughout the country. So far, more than 50 million people have participated in these demonstrations. This action once again shows that the Chinese people unswervingly safeguard the interests of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the interests of world peace. The great unity of the 900 million people of China and the Soviet Union is unbreakable and will not waver under any circumstances.

The crimes of U.S. imperialism in invading the Soviet Union and deliberately sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference are supported by both material and human evidence and cannot be denied by any means. The incoherent and self-contradictory statements and talks made successively by U.S. Secretary of State Herter and President Eisenhower not only fail to defend the crimes of the U.S. government, but also discredit themselves, placing them in complete moral bankruptcy. In order to deceive the American and world people, to wash away its crimes, to get rid of its extremely passive situation, and to put on a new disguise for its war and aggression policy, Eisenhower delivered another radio address on May 25. In this speech, this arch war-monger shamelessly repeated his set of gangster logic, saying that the U.S. sending planes into the Soviet Union to gather information was "essential" and "useful" for the "security" of the U.S. and the "free world." In addition to confessing that the U.S. had been conducting spy flights over the Soviet Union for four years and that he bore "full responsibility" for these spy flights, he also bluntly admitted that the U.S. government's initial statements on the U-2 aircraft incident were lies, in order to "cover up the mission of the plane." After this president described U.S. aggression as a "matter of course" act, he brazenly questioned the Soviet Union, "Why the great fuss about one flight?" Not only that, after the U.S.'s shady crimes of aggression were thoroughly exposed, Eisenhower even fantasized about proposing a so-called "open skies" plan, attempting to legalize U.S. aggression. In order to escape the condemnation of world public opinion, U.S. representative Lodge also made a set of sophistries similar to the U.S. president's speech at the United Nations Security Council on May 23. But no matter whether it is Eisenhower or Lodge, the arguments they painstakingly concocted, apart from further exposing their gangster faces, will absolutely not alleviate the U.S.'s crimes of aggression in the slightest. Although the U.S. can manipulate the United Nations Security Council to veto the Soviet government's proposal to condemn and stop U.S. aggression against the Soviet Union, it will never be able to wash away its gangster reputation in front of the people of the world.

What is particularly surprising is that Eisenhower, after committing the heinous crime of undermining world peace, actually played new double-dealing tactics in his speech. On the one hand, he declared that the U.S.'s war and aggression policy "has not changed" and will continue to be pursued in the future. On the other hand, he talked a lot about making "peaceful efforts," negotiating with the Soviet Union, and hypocritically said that the U.S. was prepared to "make progress" on the issues of nuclear testing and disarmament. This is truly the height of shamelessness. Eisenhower's entire conspiracy is to use his already shattered "peace" banner to cover up his heinous activities of further expanding aggression and expansion throughout the world. Immediately after sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference, the U.S. instructed the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary clique to use violence to forcibly and illegally pass the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty in the Diet. The U.S. is also plotting to lift restrictions on West German armaments. The U.S. has violated our country's territorial waters and airspace one hundred times. The U.S. is intensifying its "alert" around the world, trying its best to incite war hysteria. All of this once again shows that the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism will not change, that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world, and that no unrealistic illusions should be held about it.

When the U.S.'s crimes of aggression were severely condemned by just world public opinion, and U.S. imperialism was in an extremely embarrassing situation, the U.S.'s lackeys in many countries could not wait to come out to cover up for the U.S., slander the Soviet Union, and confuse the public opinion of the world. They described the Soviet Union's just act of opposing aggression as an "unfortunate" event and said that the failure of the Four-Power Summit Conference was the "fault of the Soviet Union." In particular, the Yugoslav revisionists, headed by Tito, initially defended the U.S. in every possible way. After the U.S. confessed to its crimes of aggression, they described the Soviet Union's opposition to U.S. aggression as "restoring the Cold War" and "not in line with mankind's deep desire for peace." There are also some imperialist echoers who dress up as if they are "impartial," saying that the U.S. and the Soviet Union are both responsible for the failure of the Four-Power Summit Conference and should each be given fifty lashes, or that the U.S. is certainly responsible for this incident, but the Soviet Union has also gone "too far" and should bear some responsibility. No matter what banner these hypocritical gentlemen are flying and what words they are using, their purpose is to absolve the U.S. aggressors of their crimes and limit the Soviet Union and the world's people's just struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression. Their true face of serving imperialism cannot be concealed in any way. The eyes of the people of the world are discerning, and they cannot be deceived.

The series of aggressive crimes committed by U.S. imperialism have further educated the people of the world from the negative side, making them more clearly aware that the achievement of world peace must rely on the unyielding struggle of the broad masses of people of all countries. The people are the creators of history and the decisive factor in defending world peace. The foundation of the world peace movement is: the people of the socialist countries who resolutely defend world peace, the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries who oppose imperialism and colonialist oppression, and the increasingly awakened peace-loving people of imperialist countries. They are the vast majority of mankind and the powerful source of peace forces. To win peace, we must resolutely rely on them, reflect their voices, and mobilize their strength. The firm stance expressed by the Soviet representatives at the preparatory meeting of the Four-Power Summit Conference and at the meeting of the United Nations Security Council undoubtedly played a significant role in exposing the war policies of the U.S. aggressors and mobilizing the world's peace forces to wage a resolute struggle against the war forces headed by U.S. imperialism.

Here, I would like to happily mention the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference held in Conakry in April this year. This conference was a grand gathering of the Asian and African people's anti-imperialist unity, and it thoroughly implemented the spirit of strong anti-imperialism from beginning to end. The resolution passed by the conference severely condemned the crimes of the imperialist group headed by the United States in undermining national independence movements and threatening world peace, clearly declared that the oppressed nations and imperialism are incompatible, that imperialism and colonialism must be completely eliminated in order to achieve peaceful coexistence and world peace, and pointed out that the struggle against imperialism and colonialism is an inseparable and important part of the world peace movement. The conference called on the people of Asian and African countries to further unite and wage a persistent struggle against imperialism and colonialism. We fully support the spirit and resolutions of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference. We believe that the national democratic struggles of the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries have given and are giving increasingly heavy blows to imperialism and are making increasingly great contributions to the cause of defending world peace, and we should spare no effort to support them. We resolutely support the just struggle of the Cuban people against U.S. imperialist aggression and interference, and we resolutely support the national liberation war of the Algerian people against imperialism and colonialism. The victorious struggles of the Cuban people and the Algerian people have had and will continue to have a profound impact on the cause of liberation of oppressed nations around the world. We resolutely support the struggle of the South African people against racial discrimination and for freedom, and support all struggles for national independence and against colonialism.

I would also like to especially point out the fierce struggles of the broad masses of people in Asian countries such as Japan, South Korea, and Turkey against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in recent times. These countries are all places that U.S. imperialism considers to be most tightly controlled, and the reactionary rulers of these countries are the most loyal lackeys of U.S. imperialism. Therefore, the continuous storm of struggles that have occurred in these countries is of particular importance in disrupting U.S. imperialism's war plans. It is a signal that the struggle of the people of the world against U.S. imperialism will have a greater upsurge, and it has opened up a new front for the struggle of the people of the world against U.S. imperialism. In these storms of struggle, the U.S.'s loyal lackey, Syngman Rhee, has been driven out of power, the Menderes traitorous government has been overthrown, and Kishi Nobusuke has also fallen into the heavy encirclement of the Japanese people. We believe that this front will inevitably be further expanded, and the volcano under the feet of U.S. imperialism may continue to erupt at any time. In order to safeguard world peace, in order to disrupt the war plans of imperialism headed by the United States, we must resolutely support the Japanese people's just struggle to smash the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke traitorous government, and support the just and patriotic struggles of the people of South Korea, the people of Turkey, and the people of other countries enslaved by the United States.

The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is a strong fortress for defending world peace. Strengthening the unity of the socialist camp, strengthening the unity of socialist forces and national democratic forces, strengthening the unity of all peace-loving people in the world, and expanding the international united front for peace and anti-imperialism are reliable guarantees for world peace. Imperialism is most afraid of the awakening and unity of the people of all countries in the world, and it painstakingly tries to split the united front of the people of the world, but this conspiracy of imperialism will never be realized. Contrary to their wishes, the perverse actions of imperialism are promoting the awakening and unity of the people of the world, making the anti-imperialist united front unprecedentedly consolidated and expanded. We must spare no effort to develop the world people's anti-imperialist united front, unite all forces that can be united, and isolate imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, to the greatest extent. Only in this way can we constantly defeat the arrogant attempts of the imperialist war forces, effectively stop their war and aggression activities, and safeguard world peace.

The Chinese people have always adhered to a peaceful foreign policy, advocated the realization of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and have made unremitting efforts to ease international tensions. We have always advocated the prohibition of nuclear weapons, the implementation of general disarmament, and the conclusion of peace and non-aggression treaties between countries. We firmly advocate resolving all international disputes through peaceful negotiations rather than resorting to force, but we believe that any international negotiations must be based on the minimum conditions of non-aggression against the other party's sovereignty and non-interference in the other party's internal affairs. Our country has conducted negotiations with the United States in Panmunjom, Geneva, and Warsaw for many years. We know very well that U.S. imperialism is completely untrustworthy. Whether it is the negotiations on the cessation of nuclear testing, the disarmament negotiations, or the fact that the Four-Power Summit Conference was sabotaged, it has repeatedly proved that U.S. imperialism will not accept negotiations unless it is absolutely necessary, and even if it is forced to accept negotiations, it will not easily reach an agreement with us. Only by waging a resolute struggle against U.S. imperialism can it be possible to force it to sit down and negotiate with us, and only by constantly exposing and attacking the U.S. imperialism's sabotage conspiracies in the negotiations can it be possible to force it to reach an agreement with us on an equal footing that can be accepted by both sides.

Now, the Four-Power Summit Conference that the people of the world yearn for has been sabotaged by the U.S. government single-handedly. Despite this, we always believe that international disputes should be resolved through negotiations. However, without the resolute struggle of the people of the world; without thoroughly exposing the faces of war-mongers like Eisenhower and harboring illusions about them; if we rely only on negotiations and not mainly on the struggle of the people, it will not be possible to force imperialism to accept negotiations and force them to reach agreements with us that are beneficial to the cause of world peace.

Friends: The current situation is very favorable to the struggle for winning and defending world peace. The main enemy of peace, U.S. imperialism, has fallen into an unprecedentedly isolated position. As long as the peace-loving countries and people of the world further unite and continue to wage a tit-for-tat struggle against the imperialist war forces headed by the United States, constantly exposing and thwarting their war and aggression activities, we will surely be able to finally win a lasting world peace. I hope that this emergency meeting of the Presidium of the World Peace Council will make due contributions to the cause of safeguarding world peace.

    美帝国主义侵略本质是不会改变的争取和平必须依靠广大人民的斗争
    中国代表郑森禹在世界和平理事会主席团会议上的发言
    新华社31日讯　斯德哥尔摩消息：郑森禹5月29日在世界和平理事会主席团斯德哥尔摩会议上的讲话全文：各位朋友：
    正当美帝国主义一手断送了四国政府首脑会议、加剧了国际紧张局势的时候，世界和平理事会主席团在这里举行紧急会议，有着特别重要的意义。我很高兴能够代表郭沫若先生出席这次会议。我相信，我们这次会议一定能够反映全世界爱好和平人民的意志，严厉谴责美帝国主义破坏四国政府首脑会议、威胁世界和平的罪行，坚决支持苏联反对美国侵略和挑衅的严正立场，并且号召全世界人民为击败美帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策而斗争。
    美国政府在原定四国政府首脑会议召开的前夕，派出间谍飞机侵犯苏联国境，并且悍然拒绝苏联政府提出的严正抗议和合理要求，使四国政府首脑会议无法举行，这是美帝国主义蓄意破坏世界和平的一次滔天罪行。中国人民和全世界一切爱好和平、主持正义的人民对美帝国主义的罪行表示无比的愤慨。中国人民完全拥护苏联赫鲁晓夫主席5月16日所发表的严正声明和葛罗米柯外长5月23日在联合国安全理事会所作的义正辞严的控诉。这个声明和控诉充分表明了伟大苏联人民维护国家主权和反对帝国主义侵略的原则立场，彻底地揭穿了美帝国主义的侵略本质和强盗逻辑，反映了强大的社会主义阵营各国人民决心制止美帝国主义的战争挑衅和维护世界和平的意志。为了反对美帝国主义的罪行，坚决支持苏联的正义立场，中国人民在全国范围举行了空前规模的示威，参加这次示威的群众到目前为止已超过五千万人。这个行动再次说明：中国人民始终不渝地维护以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的利益，维护世界和平的利益，中苏两国九亿人民的伟大团结是牢不可破的，在任何情况下都不会动摇的。
    美帝国主义侵略苏联、蓄意破坏四国政府首脑会议的罪行，人证物证俱在，是用任何办法也抵赖不了的。美国国务卿赫脱和总统艾森豪威尔先后所发表的颠三倒四和自相矛盾的声明和谈话，不仅不能替美国政府的罪行辩护，反而使得自己声名狼借，在道义上陷于完全破产。为了欺骗美国和世界各国人民，为了洗刷自己的罪责、摆脱自己极端被动的处境，为了替自己的战争侵略政策披上新的伪装，艾森豪威尔在5月25日又发表了一篇广播演说。在这篇演说里，这个头号战争贩子厚颜无耻地重复了他的一套强盗逻辑，说什么美国派遣飞机侵入苏联去搜集情报，对美国和“自由世界”的“安全”是“必不可少的”，“有用的”。他除了供称美国对苏联的间谍飞行已经进行了四年之久，自己对这种间谍飞行“担负完全的责任”以外，还直言不讳地承认美国政府最初对U—2式飞机事件所作的声明是撒谎，为的是“掩盖这架飞机的使命”。这位总统把美国的侵略说成是“天经地义”的行为以后，他竟然恬不知耻地责问苏联“为什么要对某一次飞行大冒其火呢？”不仅如此，艾森豪威尔在美国见不得天日的侵略罪行被彻底揭露以后，居然异想天开地要提出所谓“开放天空”的计划，妄图使美国的侵略行为合法化。为了逃避世界舆论的谴责，美国代表洛奇在5月23日联合国安全理事会上也作了一套同美国总统演说相类似的狡辩。但是不管艾森豪威尔也好，洛奇也好，他们苦心孤诣编造出来的辩词，除了更加暴露他们的强盗嘴脸以外，绝对不可能一丝一毫减轻美国的侵略罪行。尽管美国可以操纵联合国安全理事会否决了苏联政府谴责和制止美国对苏联进行侵略的提案，但是它要想在全世界人民面前洗刷它的强盗名声是永远也办不到的。
    特别令人惊讶的是，艾森豪威尔在犯下了破坏世界和平的滔天罪行以后，竟然又在他的演说中玩弄新的两面手法。他一方面宣称美国的战争和侵略政策“没有改变”，以后也仍然要继续推行，另一方面又大谈什么要进行“和平努力”，同苏联谈判，并且假惺惺地说美国准备在核试验和裁军问题上“取得进展”。这真可谓无耻已极。艾森豪威尔的全部阴谋就是要打起他那早已破碎不堪的“和平”幌子，掩盖他在全世界进一步扩大侵略扩张的罪恶活动。美国在破坏了四国政府首脑会议以后紧接着指使岸信介反动集团使用暴力在国会强行非法通过日美军事同盟条约。美国还阴谋解除对西德的军备限制。美国对我国领海领空的侵犯已经达到了一百次。美国正在全世界范围加紧“戒备”，竭力煽动战争歇斯底里。所有这一切再一次说明美帝国主义的侵略本质是不会改变的，美帝国主义是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人，决不应该对它抱有任何不切实际的幻想。
    当美国的侵略罪行遭到世界公正舆论的严厉谴责，美帝国主义处于极端狼狈的境地的时候，美国在许多国家的走狗，就迫不及待地出来为美国打掩护，诽谤苏联，迷惑世界人民的视听。他们把苏联反对侵略的正义行为说成是“不幸”的事件，说四国政府首脑会议的未能举行是“苏联的过错”。特别是以铁托为首的南斯拉夫修正主义者，始则百般为美国辩护，及至美国供认了自己的侵略罪行以后，又把苏联反对美国侵略说成是“恢复冷战”，“不符合人类争取和平的深切愿望。”还有一些帝国主义的应声虫，他们装扮成一副似乎是“公正”的模样，说什么这次四国政府首脑会议开不成，美国和苏联都有责任，应该各打五十板，或者说什么这次事件美国固然有责任，但是苏联也做得“太过分”，应该负一部分责任。不论这些伪善的先生们打着什么招牌，使用什么言辞，其目的都是为了替美国侵略者开脱罪责，限制苏联和全世界人民反对美帝国主义侵略的正义斗争，他们为帝国主义服务的真实面目是怎样也掩盖不住的。全世界人民的眼睛是雪亮的，他们是欺骗不了的。
    美帝国主义一系列的侵略罪行，进一步从反面教育了全世界人民，使他们更清楚地认识到世界和平的取得，必须依靠各国广大人民群众不屈不挠的斗争。人民群众是历史的创造者，是保卫世界和平的决定性因素。世界和平运动的基础是：坚决捍卫世界和平的社会主义国家的人民，反对帝国主义、殖民主义压迫的亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国的人民，日益觉醒的帝国主义国家的爱好和平的人民。他们是人类的绝大多数，是和平力量的强大源泉。我们要赢得和平就唯有坚决依靠他们，反映他们的呼声，动员他们的力量。这次苏联代表在四国政府首脑会议的预备会议中，在联合国安全理事会会议中所表示的坚定立场，对于揭露美国侵略者的战争政策，对于动员世界和平力量向以美帝国主义为首的战争势力进行坚决的斗争，无疑地起着巨大的作用。
    在这里，我愿意高兴地提到今年4月间在科纳克里举行的第二届亚非人民团结大会。这次大会是亚非人民反帝大团结的盛会，自始至终贯彻着强烈的反帝精神。大会所通过的决议严厉谴责了以美国为首的帝国主义集团破坏民族独立运动、威胁世界和平的罪行，明确宣布被压迫民族同帝国主义是不能相容的，必须彻底消除帝国主义和殖民主义才能实现和平共处和世界和平，并且指出反对帝国主义、殖民主义的斗争是世界和平运动不可分割的重要部分。大会号召亚非各国人民进一步团结起来同帝国主义、殖民主义进行坚持不懈的斗争。我们完全拥护亚非人民团结大会的精神和决议。我们认为亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民的民族民主斗争已经和正在给予帝国主义以越来越沉重的打击，对保卫世界和平的事业做出了越来越大的贡献，我们应该不遗余力地给予支持。我们坚决支持古巴人民反对美帝国主义的侵略和干涉的正义斗争，坚决支持阿尔及利亚人民反对帝国主义、殖民主义的民族解放战争。古巴人民和阿尔及利亚人民的胜利斗争对全世界被压迫民族争取解放的事业，已经发生并且还将继续发生深远的影响。我们坚决支持南非人民反对种族歧视、要求自由的斗争，支持所有争取和维护民族独立、反对殖民主义的斗争。
    我还愿意特别指出最近在日本、南朝鲜和土耳其等亚洲国家所爆发的广大人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的激烈斗争。这些国家都是美帝国主义自认为控制得最严密的地方，这些国家的反动统治者都是美帝国主义最忠实的走狗。因此，在这些国家连续发生的斗争风暴对于打乱美帝国主义的战争部署具有特别重要的意义，它是全世界人民反对美帝国主义的斗争将有更大兴起的讯号，它为全世界人民反对美帝国主义的斗争开辟了一条新的战线。在这些斗争风暴中，美国的忠实走狗李承晚已经被撵下台了，曼德列斯卖国政府被推翻了，岸信介也已陷入日本人民的重重包围之中。我们相信，这条战线必然还会进一步扩大，美帝国主义脚下的火山随时都有继续爆发的可能。为了维护世界和平，为了破坏以美国为首的帝国主义的战争计划，我们必须坚决支持日本人民粉碎美日军事同盟条约、打倒岸信介卖国政府的正义斗争，支持南朝鲜人民、土耳其人民和其它在美国奴役下的人民反美爱国的正义斗争。
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营是保卫世界和平的坚强堡垒。加强社会主义阵营的团结，加强社会主义力量和民族民主力量的团结，加强全世界一切爱好和平的人民的团结，扩大和平反帝的国际统一战线，是世界和平的可靠保障。帝国主义最怕世界各国人民的觉悟和团结，处心积虑地要分裂世界人民的统一战线，但是帝国主义的这种阴谋是永远不能实现的。帝国主义的倒行逆施同它们的愿望相反，正在促进世界人民的觉悟和团结，使反帝统一战线空前巩固和扩大。我们必须不遗余力地发展世界人民的反帝统一战线，团结一切可以团结的力量，最大限度地孤立帝国主义特别是美帝国主义。只有这样，才能不断地击败帝国主义战争势力的狂妄企图，有效地制止它们的战争和侵略活动，维护世界和平。
    中国人民一贯坚持和平的外交政策，主张按照和平共处五项原则实现不同社会制度的国家的和平共处，并且为和缓国际紧张局势进行了不懈的努力。我们一贯主张禁止核武器，实行普遍裁军，缔结各国之间的和平和互不侵犯条约。我们坚决主张通过和平谈判解决一切国际争端，而不诉诸武力，但是我们认为任何国际谈判都必须以互不侵犯对方主权、互不干涉对方内政为起码条件。我国同美国在板门店、日内瓦和华沙进行过多年的谈判。我们深知美帝国主义是毫无信义的。无论是停止核试验的谈判、裁军谈判以及这次四国政府首脑会议被破坏的事实，都一再证明，非在万不得已的条件下，美帝国主义是不会接受谈判的，即使被迫接受谈判也是不会轻易同我们达成协议的。只有同美帝国主义进行坚决的斗争，才有可能迫使它坐下来同我们谈判，只有在谈判中不断揭露和打击美帝国主义的破坏阴谋，才有可能迫使它同我们在平等的基础上达成能为双方所接受的协议。
    现在，全世界人民所渴望的四国首脑会议已经被美国政府一手破坏了。尽管如此，我们始终认为应该通过谈判的方式解决国际争端。但是，如果没有全世界人民的坚决斗争；如果不对艾森豪威尔之流的战争贩子的面目进行彻底的揭露，而对他们抱有幻想，如果仅仅依靠谈判而不主要依靠人民的斗争，那就不可能迫使帝国主义接受谈判，迫使它们同我们达成有益于世界和平事业的协议。
    朋友们：目前形势十分有利于争取和保卫世界和平的斗争，和平的主要敌人美帝国主义已经陷于空前孤立的地位。只要全世界爱好和平的国家和人民进一步团结起来，再接再厉地同以美国为首的帝国主义战争势力进行针锋相对的斗争，不断地揭露和挫败它们的战争和侵略活动，我们就一定能够最后赢得世界的持久和平。我希望这次世界和平理事会主席团紧急会议将对维护世界和平的事业做出应有的贡献。
