Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 19th: The United States' conspiracy to forcibly impose the US-Japan military treaty on the Japanese people in order to further revive Japanese militarism is encountering increasing opposition from ordinary Americans at home.

    Four hundred American missionaries jointly issued a statement protesting the US-Japan military treaty. The statement pointed out that this treaty is clearly intended to pave the way for arming Japan with nuclear weapons.

    The statement exposed the collusion between US and Japanese monopoly capitalists, who are using military "aid" and military contracts to enrich themselves. It stated that more than 800 American companies have ties with Japanese companies, and that Japan has received more than $2 billion in loans in the post-war years. The statement also pointed out that the US government, which is pursuing a hostile policy towards China, is trying to turn Japan into a militarized nation. At the same time, the US Pentagon is unwilling to withdraw US troops from Japan.

    The statement emphasized that while the Soviet Union has announced its willingness to carry out complete and thorough disarmament and is calling for easing international tensions, the United States is pursuing a policy that goes in the opposite direction.

    A letter to the editor published in the "Washington Post" also condemned the aggressive nature of the US-Japan military alliance treaty. The reader, Inelst, pointed out in the letter that the Japanese people have excluded war from their constitution as a means of achieving national policy, "but we (the United States) are asking to rearm Japan." The Japanese people do not want to turn Japan into a US military outpost, "but we are putting pressure on it (Japan) to join a military treaty." Another reader emphasized that the Japanese people's opposition to Eisenhower's visit is undoubtedly due to their remembering the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

    美国四百名传教士发表声明
    抗议美日军事同盟条约
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社华盛顿讯：美国强把美日军事条约加于日本人民头上以便进一步复活日本军国主义的阴谋，在国内也愈来愈多地遭到普通美国人的反对。
    四百名美国传教士联合发表了一个声明，抗议美日军事条约。声明指出，这个条约显然是要为以核武器武装日本一事开辟道路。
    声明揭露了美日垄断资本家互相勾结，利用军事“援助”和军事合同来喂肥自己。它说，有八百家以上的美国公司同日本公司有联系，而且，在战后的年代中，日本已经得到二十亿美元以上的贷款。声明还指出，推行敌视中国政策的美国政府竭力使日本成为一个军国主义化的国家。同时，美国五角大楼也不愿意把美军撤出日本。
    声明强调指出，当苏联已经宣布愿意进行全面彻底裁军并且要求缓和国际紧张局势的时候，美国却在推行朝着相反的方向走的政策。
    发表在“华盛顿邮报”上的一封读者来信也谴责了美日军事同盟条约的侵略性质。读者英内尔斯特在信中指出，日本人民从宪法中排除了战争作为实现民族政策的手段，“而我们（美国）却要求把日本重新武装起来”。日本人民不希望把日本变成为美国的军事前哨，“而我们却对它施压力，要它（日本）参加军事条约”。另一位读者强调指出，日本人民反对艾森豪威尔的访问，无疑是由于他们想起了广岛、长崎所受到的原子弹轰炸。
