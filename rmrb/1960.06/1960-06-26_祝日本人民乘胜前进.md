    Wishing the Japanese People Continued Success
    Sha Ting
    When I was very young, I yearned for Japan and hoped to have the opportunity to visit. Because our Lu Xun and Guo Moruo both returned from studying in Japan, and through their introductions to Japan, I grew to like Japan even more.
    Thanks to the efforts of progressive cultural circles in Japan, many Russian revolutionary documents seemed to be introduced there faster and in greater quantity than in China for a period, which was another reason for my yearning for Japan. To this end, around 1930, I even studied Japanese in Shanghai for a period, forcing myself to read Chernyshevsky's "Art and Life" and some other things.
    Of course, I never went to Japan, nor did I know any Japanese friends. Later, the Sino-Japanese War broke out, and Japanese militarists shattered my hopes. But in the vast plains of central Hebei, I had the opportunity to come into contact with individual Japanese people. It was after the Battle of Datuanting Village, around 1939, that I met a wounded Japanese soldier in a brick-and-wood courtyard.
    This was an ordinary Japanese person, forcibly drafted to the front lines for less than three months. He had a family and already had three children. His wound was on his chest, slightly to the left, and our medic was changing his dressing. He told me about the situation of some Japanese soldiers in an angry tone: they all detested this dirty war of aggression against China. He cited two prominent examples to me: in Gaoyang, a young Japanese soldier shot himself in the mouth one night in the barracks and committed suicide; another committed seppuku while on guard duty...
    This incident impressed me deeply because it clearly showed that Japanese militarism and fascist reactionaries were the common enemies of the Chinese and Japanese people. Only by defeating Japanese militarism and fascist reactionaries could the Chinese and Japanese people be liberated. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people finally drove out Japanese imperialism, destroyed the Chiang Kai-shek dynasty and its master, American imperialism, and began to create a better and happier life with our own hardworking hands.
    I have just returned to Chengdu from Wusheng, Hongqi County, Sichuan. When I think of the heroic people active on the production front, I am even more sympathetic to the Japanese people's current struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. Because according to our own personal experience, unless this thoroughly aggressive treaty that revives Japanese militarism is opposed, unless the mastermind of this dirty treaty, American imperialism, is driven out of Japan, and unless the running dog of American imperialism, Nobusuke Kishi, is overthrown, the Japanese people will not be able to escape the enslavement of imperialism and domestic reactionaries.
    The facts before us prove that the Japanese people are indomitable. Due to their continuous and heroic struggle, and due to the continuous expansion of the scale and scope of the struggle, they have won one victory after another. The plague god Eisenhower, who dreamed of further planning wars of aggression on the sacred land of Japan, has already tasted rejection; the faithful lackey of American imperialism, Nobusuke Kishi, has also collapsed under the iron fists of the people.
    Chairman Mao Zedong said well when he met the Japanese literary delegation that he did not believe that a great nation like Japan would be ruled by foreigners for a long time. He said, "The independence and freedom of Japan are very promising." Now, the Japanese people are carrying out the struggle to the end without letting up! If the struggle is carried out to the end, victory will inevitably belong to the Japanese people.
    I remotely wish the Japanese people a complete victory through resolute struggle. Moreover, I firmly believe that it will not be long before I will be able to visit an independent, democratic, peaceful, and happy Japanese land as a citizen of the People's Republic of China with a relaxed mood.

    祝日本人民乘胜前进
    沙汀
    在我还很年轻的时候，我曾经向往过日本，希望有机会到日本去看看。因为我们的鲁迅、郭沫若都是日本留学回来的，通过他们对于日本的介绍，我也更喜欢日本了。
    由于日本进步文化界的努力，不少俄国革命文献，有个时期，好像比中国介绍得更快更多一些，这也是我向往日本的原因之一。为此，1930年前后，我在上海还学过一个时期的日文，硬着头皮阅读车勒内夫斯基的“艺术与生活”、以及别的一些东西。
    当然，我始终没有到过日本，也不认识一个日本朋友。后来，中日战争爆发了，日本军国主义者打破了我的希望。但在广阔的冀中平原，我却有机会接触到个别日本人。因为1939年我随同八路军的一二○师在河北中部的游击区住过一个时期。大约是大团丁村战役之后的事，一天，我在一所砖木结构的院子里，同一个负伤的日本士兵会见了。
    这是一个普通日本人民，他被迫征调到前线，还不到三个月。他是有家室的，已经有三个孩子了。他的伤口在胸部上，稍微偏左，我们的卫生员正在替他换药。他用一种愤怒的语调告诉了我一些日本士兵的情况：他们都很厌恶这一场肮脏的侵华战争。他还对我举了两个比较突出的例子，在高阳，一个年轻日本士兵，一天夜里，在军营房里对着自己的口腔放了一枪，自杀了；一个在放哨当中切腹而死……。
    这件事给我印象很深，因为它清清楚楚地说明了日本军国主义和法西斯反动派，是中日两国人民的共同敌人。只有打败日本军国主义和法西斯反动派，中日两国人民才能获得解放。在中国共产党领导下，中国人民终于赶走了日本帝国主义，摧毁了蒋介石王朝和它的主子美帝国主义，开始用我们自己的勤劳的双手创造美好幸福的生活。
    我是刚从四川的红旗县武胜回到成都来的，当我想到那些活跃在生产战线上的英雄人民的时候，我也更加对日本人民目前进行的反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争充满同情。因为根据我们自己切身的经验，不反对掉这个彻头彻尾复活日本军国主义的侵略性的条约，不把这个肮脏条约的主谋者美帝国主义赶出日本，不把美帝国主义的走狗岸信介打倒，日本人民将不可能摆脱帝国主义和国内反动派的奴役。
    眼前的事实证明，日本人民是不可屈服的。由于他们持续不断的英勇斗争，由于斗争规模和范围的不断扩大，他们已经赢得了斗争的一个又一个胜利。梦想在日本神圣国土上进一步策划侵略战争的瘟神艾森豪威尔，已经尝到闭门羹了；美帝国主义的忠实奴才岸信介也已经在人民的铁拳下坍了台。
    毛泽东主席在接见日本文学家代表团时说得好，他不相信，像日本这样伟大的民族会长期受外国人统治。他说：“日本的独立和自由是很有希望的。”现在，日本人民正在不松一口气地把斗争进行到底！斗争到底，胜利就必然属于日本人民。
    我遥祝日本人民通过坚决斗争获得彻底的胜利。而且，我万分相信，不会过很久，有那么一天，我能够以一个中华人民共和国的公民身份，心情舒畅地到一个独立、民主、和平幸福的日本国土上作客。
