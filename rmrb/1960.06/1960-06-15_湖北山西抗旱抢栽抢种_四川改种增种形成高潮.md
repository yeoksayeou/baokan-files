Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, June 13th: Hubei Province has experienced drought in some areas during the tense period of mid-season rice transplanting. These areas are using the experience of overcoming the hundred-day drought last year to find water sources in every possible way and fight the drought to transplant rice.

Since the beginning of summer, Hubei has had prolonged sunny weather with little rain, and drought has appeared in some hilly areas with poor water conservancy conditions and where ponds and reservoirs have not been filled. The Party organizations at all levels in these areas criticized the paralyzing idea of waiting for rain as soon as the drought appeared, established drought prevention and resistance headquarters, and led the masses to rise up to fight the drought. In order to ensure timely transplanting, the Xincheng Commune in Dawu County mobilized more than 900 people and more than 290 waterwheels on May 30th alone to draw water to irrigate the fields and rush to transplant 109 mu of mid-season rice. The captain of the third production team of the Shishan Management District of this commune also led 60 commune members to build seven dams across the river, so that nearly 100 mu of mid-season rice fields that originally had no water for transplanting were irrigated and transplanted. Due to the rational allocation and conservation of water, the Chenxiang Commune in Yingshan County not only ensured the irrigation and transplanting of the original paddy fields, but the entire commune can also expand the area of rice by more than 3,000 mu. During the drought resistance and rice transplanting, the Yuntai Management District of the Maping Commune in the same county also exceeded the original transplanting plan of 12,200 mu by 200 mu.

In order to fight the drought and rush to transplant mid-season rice, these areas actively opened up and extended the original reservoir channels, further leveraging the role of the original water conservancy projects; at the same time, some small ponds and reservoirs were also built. For example, the Hubichong Reservoir newly built in Yingshan County this spring had not yet been put into operation. In the recent drought resistance, more than 1,700 people were concentrated to fight day and night, opening a channel more than one li long to ensure timely water use. The Fengshou Production Team of the Chengjiao Commune in the same county added a branch canal to the Taoyuan Reservoir, which increased the irrigation area by more than 450 mu. From May 27th to June 2nd, the Wuyi Commune in Yichang County transplanted more than 11,000 mu of rice while resisting drought, and also renovated 503 ponds and reservoirs. In addition, in order to save water, many communes have further rectified the water use system.

Now, some drought-stricken areas have received rain and are organizing labor to store and conserve water, and continue to prepare for drought prevention and resistance.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, June 13th: A climax of summer planting to resist drought, centered on "ensuring expansion, ensuring proportion, and ensuring full seedlings," has been vigorously launched in Shanxi Province.

Since mid-May, there has been little rainfall in various parts of Shanxi, and the drought has continued to develop. The three special districts of Jinan, Jinbei, and Jindongnan have been more severely affected by the drought. The dry soil layer is generally two to three inches deep. It has a great impact on the current summer planting work and the growth of autumn crops. In order to ensure the timely completion of the summer planting tasks, the people's communes throughout the province have vigorously promoted the anti-drought experience of concentrated well-digging during spring planting, rational irrigation, and planting by carrying water, and have drawn a large number of laborers to rush to plant while harvesting wheat and irrigating under the slogan of "harvesting wheat, irrigating, and sowing simultaneously." People's communes in the Jinan area are rushing to harvest wheat and vigorously carry out summer planting to resist drought. Recently, more than 1.6 million mu of wheat stubble fields have been irrigated in the entire area, and 600,000 mu have been planted with various crops. The drought-resistant sowing army in the Jindongnan area implemented the principle of bringing surface water up the mountains and irrigating the plains with groundwater. By every possible means, they have rushed to intercrop more than 500,000 mu of crops such as corn and sorghum in the past five days. People's communes in the Jinbei area have also used wasteland, saline-alkali land, and scattered land to plant more than 1 million mu of various early-maturing crops while resisting drought and rushing to plant.

In the drought resistance and rushing to plant, all localities have paid attention to implementing the policy of taking grain as the key link and diversifying operations, and strived to expand the area of summer planting. The Jinbei Special District has expanded the area of summer planting by more than 1.3 million mu by reclaiming wasteland, implementing agroforestry intercropping, and combining water and soil conservation to expand cultivated land. Yangcheng County promoted the experience of intercropping corn in wheat fields, and the area of intercropping corn in the county has increased by 80,000 mu compared with last year. The Jinan Special District, which is rich in cotton and wheat, has not only completed the planting plan of 1.5 million mu of corn and 500,000 mu of potato crops during the summer planting, but also tried every means to expand the crops such as vegetables, millet, minor grains, and feed. In Yanggao County in the Jinbei area, everyone plants and plants everywhere. At present, more than 100,000 mu of Chinese yam, millet, oil crops, vegetables, hemp, and wild plants have been planted.

In order to improve the quality of summer planting, all localities have also carried out the "thousands of carts and ten thousands of dan" fertilizer accumulation, fertilizer production, and fertilizer transportation campaign during the gap time before wheat harvest. Thirteen counties including Yuncheng, Yicheng, Hongtong, and Yuanqu have accumulated more than 300 million dan of fertilizer for summer planting, exceeding the original plan by 50%, and more than 110 million dan have been delivered to the fields in advance.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, June 13th: Under the slogan of "seizing the season, racing against time, ensuring the area without reducing a cent," Sichuan has launched a movement to replant, resow, and increase planting, striving to plant more, plant fully, and ensure a bumper harvest of spring crops.

After more than a month of intense battle, the tens of millions of labor forces in Sichuan Province have achieved remarkable results in summer harvest and summer planting. The harvesting of small spring crops throughout the province was basically completed as early as the end of May. Recently, good news about the planting of large spring crops has been frequently reported. As of June 5th, more than 25 million mu of mid-season rice and more than 6 million mu of sweet potatoes have been planted throughout the province. Various localities have also widely used marginal land to increase planting of a large number of minor grains and bean crops.

In order to ensure quality and area, while grasping the planting of large spring crops, all localities have mobilized the masses to conduct a general inspection of various crops that have been planted. All those with missing seedlings or sparse planting have been immediately replanted and resown to ensure reasonable close planting, full seedlings, and complete seedlings. After the basic completion of mid-season rice transplanting in Xinfan County, the entire county immediately fixed special personnel to contract in sections and segments, and more than 90% of the mid-season rice has been inspected and replanted to ensure that every plot has full seedlings and every seedling is strong. The people's communes in the Yingxi District of Nanchong County organized a replenishment commando team of more than 2,100 people and adopted the method of inspecting plot by plot and storming in sections. In two days, they replanted seedlings for more than 9,000 mu of cotton and corn, and also transplanted more than 400,000 seedlings of sorghum and pumpkin.

For some paddy fields that have no guaranteed water source for transplanting, Party organizations at all levels have quickly resisted drought and resown high-yielding dryland crops such as corn and sweet potatoes. The people's communes in the Jiangjin Special District have resisted drought and resown more than 300,000 mu of dryland crops such as corn, sweet potatoes, and sorghum. In many places, after resowing, professional teams were immediately organized to topdress and weed the resown crops in a timely manner to ensure that the resown crops have full and strong seedlings and grow well.

While vigorously grasping replanting and resowing, all localities have also widely mobilized the masses to fully utilize all small pieces of vacant land to carry out an increased planting campaign focusing on sweet potatoes and corn. After overfulfilling the task of planting more than 400,000 mu of sweet potatoes in Pengxi County, the entire county also used vacant land to increase planting of more than 4 million sweet potato seedlings. The people's communes in Shehong County organized the masses to rush to plant during the early morning and evening hours. At present, the county has scattered more than 200,000 jin of soybean seeds and 100,000 jin of mung bean seeds on vacant land. After sowing, all localities have generally strengthened management to ensure that they are planted well, managed well, planted more, and harvested more.

    湖北山西抗旱抢栽抢种  四川改种增种形成高潮
    新华社武汉13日电　湖北省局部地区在紧张的中稻插秧期间出现了旱象。这些地区正运用去年战胜百日大旱的经验，千方百计大找水源，抗旱插秧。
    入夏以来，湖北地区久晴不雨，一些水利条件较差的丘陵地区和堰塘没有蓄满水的地方，先后出现旱象。这些地区的各级党组织，当旱象刚一露头就批判了等雨的麻痹思想，建立了防旱抗旱指导部，领导群众奋起抗旱。大悟县新城公社为保证适时插秧，5月30日一天就出动了九百多人、二百九十多部水车车水灌田，抢插中稻一百零九亩。这个公社的石山管理区第三生产队队长还带领六十个社员拦河筑坝七处，使原来无水插秧的近百亩中稻田灌水插了秧。应山县陈巷公社由于合理调剂用水和节约用水，不仅保证了原有稻田灌水插秧，全公社还可扩大水稻面积三千多亩。同县马坪公社云台管理区在抗旱插秧中间也超额二百亩完成了原订一万二千二百亩的插秧计划。
    为了抗旱抢插中稻，这些地区积极开通和延长了原有水库的渠道，进一步发挥了原有水利工程的作用；同时还修了一些小型塘堰。如应山县今春新建的虎弼冲水库原来还没通水，在最近抗旱中集中一千七百多人奋战一昼夜，开通一里多长的渠道，保证及时用水。同县城郊公社丰收生产队在桃园水库增开了一条支渠，就增加灌溉面积四百五十多亩。宜昌县五一公社从5月27日到6月2日间，抗旱插秧一万一千多亩，结合整修塘堰五百零三处。此外，为了节约用水，不少公社进一步整顿了用水的制度。
    现在，有部分受旱地区得雨，正在组织劳力蓄水保水，继续作好防旱抗旱准备。
    新华社太原13日电　以“保扩大、保比例、保全苗”为中心的抗旱夏种高潮，已在山西省蓬勃展开。
    5月中旬以来，山西各地落雨很少，旱象不断发展，晋南、晋北、晋东南三个专区受旱较重。干土层一般都在二至三寸。对当前夏种工作和大秋作物的生长有很大影响。全省各地人民公社为了保证夏种任务的适时完成，都大力推广了春播中突击打井，合理灌溉，担水点种等抗旱经验，在“边麦收、边灌溉、边下种”的口号下，抽出大批劳力突击抗旱下种。晋南地区各人民公社一面抢收小麦，一面大搞抗旱夏种。最近，全区已浇麦茬田一百六十多万亩，并有六十万亩已种上各种作物。晋东南地区的抗旱播种大军，实行地面水上山，地下水浇川，千方百计地在最近5日内就抗旱套种玉米、高粱等作物五十多万亩。晋北地区各人民公社在抗旱抢种中，还利用荒滩、碱地和零星地种植了各种早熟作物一百多万亩。
    各地在抗旱抢种中都注意了贯彻以粮为纲、多种经营的方针，力争扩大夏种面积。晋北专区通过开垦荒地，实行农林间作，结合水土保持扩大耕地，已扩大了夏种面积一百三十多万亩。阳城县推广麦田套种玉米的经验，全县套种玉米面积比去年扩大了八万亩。盛产棉、麦的晋南专区，夏种中除完成了一百五十万亩玉米、五十万亩薯类作物的种植计划以外，还千方百计地扩大蔬菜、谷子、小杂粮、饲料等作物。晋北地区的阳高县人人种、到处种，目前已种植山药、谷子、油料作物、蔬菜、麻、野生植物等十多万亩。
    为了提高夏种质量，各地在麦收前的一段空隙时间里还开展了“千车万担”的积肥、造肥、运肥运动。运城、翼城、洪洞和垣曲等十三个县，已为夏种积制肥料三亿多担，超过原计划50％，有一亿一千多担已提前送到地头。
    新华社成都13日电　四川各地在“抢季节分秒必争，保面积分厘不少”的口号下，掀起补种、改种、增种运动，力争多栽多种，满栽满种，保证大春作物大丰收。
    四川省几千万劳动大军，经过一个多月的紧张战斗，夏收夏种工作取得了显著成绩。全省小春作物的收割工作早在5月底就基本结束。最近，大春栽种捷报又频频传来。到6月5日，全省已栽中稻二千五百多万亩，甘薯六百多万亩。各地还广泛利用边角地增种了大批小杂粮和豆类等作物。
    为了保质量、保面积，各地一面抓大春栽种，一面发动群众普遍检查已栽的各种作物，凡是缺窝断苗或种植过稀的，都立即补栽补种，保证做到合理密植，苗全苗齐。新繁县在中稻栽插基本结束后，全县立即固定专人，分片分段包干，90％以上的中稻已进行了查补，保证了块块全苗，苗苗全壮。南充县濚溪区各人民公社组织了二千一百多人的查补突击队，采取逐块检查、成片突击的办法，两天时间就给九千多亩棉花、玉米补了苗，还移栽了高粱、南瓜四十多万窝。
    各级党组织对于部分确无水源保证栽插的稻田，都迅速抗旱改种玉米、甘薯等旱地高产作物。江津专区各人民公社已抗旱改种玉米、红苕、高粱等旱地作物三十多万亩。许多地方，在改种以后，都立即组织专业队伍，及时给改种的作物追肥薅草，确保改种作物苗全苗壮，生长良好。
    各地在大抓补种、改种的同时还广泛发动群众，充分利用一切小块空闲地，开展以甘薯、玉米为主的增种运动。蓬溪县在超额完成四十多万亩甘薯栽插任务以后，全县还利用空闲地增种了甘薯四百多万窝。射洪县各人民公社组织群众利用早晚时间突击抢种，现在全县已在空闲地撒播黄豆种子二十多万斤，绿豆种子十万多斤。播种以后，各地都普遍加强了管理，保证种好管好，多种多收。
