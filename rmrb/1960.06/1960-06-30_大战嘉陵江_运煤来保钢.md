Party Committee Secretary's Notes

    Great Battle of the Jialing River: Transport Coal to Guarantee Steel Production
    By Wei Zhaohong, Secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Water Transportation Company Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

    "Winding waterways, narrow shoals, water levels dropping to minus three (feet), transporting coal to guarantee steel production must be achieved by breaking through the dry season barrier!" This is the battle cry put forward by the Chongqing water transport workers. The rapid development of China's industrial and agricultural production has brought heavy tasks to transportation work. However, this year the Jialing River's water level has been relentlessly dropping, falling to an unprecedented low in twenty-three years, reaching minus three feet. The lower the water level, the narrower the waterway, the more turbulent the current, and the more dangerous the shoals. This has brought serious difficulties and tests to our water transportation, especially the ten major dangerous shoals that the Yu (Chongqing) Bai (Miaozi) line has to pass through. According to the instructions of the higher-level Party committee, the transportation of coal and coke must be guaranteed, and steel production cannot be affected by the lack of coal and coke supply. The slogan "Let the dry season surrender, let the dangerous shoals give way, go all out, make every effort, overcome the dry season, transport coal to guarantee steel production" has blown like a spring breeze onto all the ships and barges of our company, resounding like spring thunder on the Jialing River. Engage in a heroic and tenacious struggle with narrow waterways, dry water, dangerous shoals, and treacherous waters, to ensure no coal is left in the mines, no iron stays in the ports, strive for every second, every ounce, transport as much as possible, transport as much as comes. This has become the determination and guiding principle of every worker. The employees of our company fought day and night, worked selflessly, and won a great victory in transporting coal to guarantee steel production, writing a glorious page. From January to May this year, coal transportation volume increased by 120.63% compared with the same period last year, coke increased by 284.66%, pig iron increased by 181.03%, and steel and steel materials increased by 238.07%, ensuring the timely transportation of grain, fodder and steel materials for the steel mills.
      "Taking steel as the key link" is a great political task to change China's "poor and blank" state. Our water transport workers, in order to rush the transportation of coal and coke to ensure the normal production of steel, spent their days and nights overcoming the dry season on the Jialing River, racking their brains, and putting in hard work, enduring many sleepless nights. The employees of the beaching teams at several major dangerous shoals such as Litan, Huangpanshi, and Hongshaqi, inspired by the battle cries of "make way for difficulties and dangers, and let reefs bow their heads" and "fight hard against Hongshaqi, attack Huangpanshi fiercely, decisive battle at Datan, fight skillfully at Xiaojiguan, take down Zhuozijiao, and break through the 1,000-ton barrier," put forward the heroic slogan of "how many ships come, how many ships are pulled, how many ships are transferred, ensure that the day's tasks are completed on the same day." In order to solve the problem of insufficient labor, the workers on the barges achieved a major innovation of having two people release a heavy load. In the first quarter of this year alone, more than 500 boats were pushed and pulled by manpower. When the water was dry and the waterway was narrow, making direct navigation impossible, the tugboat workers came up with the method of segmented transshipment. The current was turbulent, there were few tugboats, and the speed was slow, which seriously affected the supply of grain and fodder to the steel mills. The workers adopted the method of using capstans and letting go of anchors to solve the problem. In the past, only three boats could be towed at a time at the Heiyangshi Shoal, but after adopting the "letting go of anchors" method, up to five boats could be towed at a time. When the water was shallow and the propeller needed to be raised, the workers used stones to press down the bow of the boat, lifting the stern. In overcoming the dry season and shallow shoals, heroes from all walks of life showed their extraordinary abilities. The employees of the No. 8 tugboat, under the action slogan of "be a good vanguard in transportation, and don't let the steel mills lack grain and fodder," created a record of towing eight barges of more than 500 tons on the Longxi River to Guabangshan route; all the employees of the No. 10 tugboat, inspired by the battle cry of "overcome the dry season, transport coal to guarantee steel production," achieved "everyone on duty during the Spring Festival, fighting through the night." Under the condition of 0.2 meters of water level in the Jialing River, they carried forward the spirit of daring to think and daring to do, and created a new record of towing sixteen barges, more than 700 tons. Comrade Zeng Huaxuan, a representative of the National Congress of Heroes, and all the employees of the No. 9 tugboat where he worked, were even more heroic and energetic in the battle to overcome the dry season and transport coal to guarantee steel production. In particular, Comrade Zeng Huaxuan, in order to ensure the completion of the coal and coke transportation task, humbly learned from his comrades, and worked with Comrade Xu Jianqing, an advanced producer in the city, and all the employees of the No. 8 tugboat to create a set of experiences to overcome the dry season, such as "active tow ropes, long towing methods for towing up and down shoals, and moth whiskers," which further solved the key problems of "flexibility, multi-towing, and safety." Comrade Zeng Huaxuan, due to the conscientious adoption of these advanced operating methods, successively created new records of towing sixteen, nineteen, twenty, and twenty-one barges. It is truly "giant dragons flying on the Jialing River, the dry season should not try to trap the dragons." Because the difficulties such as the dry season and narrow waterways of the Jialing River were overcome, the coal and coke needs of the steel mills were ensured.
    Mountains have tops, but there is no limit to the leap forward in production. The sea is wide and has edges, but the potential for tapping transportation is endless. The employees of the Water Transportation Company will set greater ambitions, never be arrogant, hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, redouble their efforts, make progress every day, and constantly move forward.

    大战嘉陵江　运煤来保钢
    中共重庆市水上交通运输公司委员会书记　魏兆鸿
    “塆曲漕道，狭窄的滩，水位降到零下三（尺），运煤保钢要实现，必须攻破枯水关”。这是重庆水上运输工人们提出的战斗口号。我国工、农业生产的迅速发展给运输工作带来了繁重的任务。可是今年嘉陵江的水，无情的往下降，降到了二十三年来从未有过的特枯水位，降到了零下三尺。水位越下降，漕口越狭窄，水流越湍急，滩口越险，这给我们水上交通运输带来了严重的困难和考验，特别是渝（重庆）白
  （庙子）线所要经过的十大险滩，更是突出。根据上级党委的指示，煤炭和焦炭运输必须保证，不能使钢厂的生产因为煤炭和焦炭供应不上而受到影响，提出要“枯水投降，险滩让路，鼓足干劲，全力以赴，战胜枯水，运煤保钢”的口号，像春风一样吹到我公司各艘轮、驳船上，像春雷响彻在嘉陵江上。与漕窄、枯水、凶滩、恶水开展一场英勇顽强的搏斗，做到矿不存煤，港不留铁，分秒必争，斤两不压，有多少运多少，来多少运多少，这已经是每个工人的决心和行动指南。我公司的职工日夜奋战，忘我劳动，赢得了运煤保钢巨大的胜利，写出了光辉的一页。今年1至5月煤炭运输量比去年同期增长120．63％，焦炭增长284．66％，生铁增长181．03％，钢、钢材增长238．07％，保证了钢厂粮草和钢铁物资的及时运输。
      “以钢为纲”，这是改变我国
  “一穷二白”面貌的一个伟大的政治任务。我们水上交通运输职工为了赶运煤焦，保证钢铁的正常生产，在战胜嘉陵江枯水的日日夜夜里，挖空心思，绞尽脑汁，付出了辛勤的劳动，熬过了多少不眠的夜晚。利滩、黄盘石、红沙碛等几个主要险滩的拉滩保钢队的职工们，在要
  “难险让路，礁石低头”和“大战红沙碛，猛攻黄盘石，决战大利滩，巧战小鸡冠，拿下桌子角，攻破千吨关”的战斗口号鼓舞下，又提出了“来多少船，拉多少船，转多少船，保证当天的任务当天完”的英雄口号。为了解决劳动力不足的问题，驳船上的工人们实现了两人放一重儎的重大创举。在今年第一季度里，光是人力推、拉就达五百余只船。拖轮工人在水枯漕窄不能直航的情况下，就提出了分段接运的办法。水流湍急，拖船少，行驶慢，严重影响钢厂粮草的供应，工人们就采取绞滩机和放碾的办法解决。黑羊石滩险过去一次只能拖三只，采取“放碾”后，一次可拖到五只了。水浅了要打车叶，工人们就用石头压船头，将船尾翘起。在战胜枯水和浅滩中，各路英雄大显奇能。运输八号拖轮职工在“当好运输先行官，不让钢厂缺粮草”的行动口号下，在龙溪河至挂膀山航线上创造了拖带八只五百余吨的纪录；十号轮全体职工，在“战胜枯水，运煤保钢”的战斗口号鼓舞下。做到了“春节期中人人出勤、奋战通宵。在嘉陵江零点二米水位的情况下，发扬了敢想敢干的精神，创造了拖带十六驳，七百余吨的新纪录。全国群英会代表曾华轩同志所在的
  九号轮全体职工，在战胜枯水运煤保钢的战斗中，更是气贯长虹，干劲冲天。特别是曾华轩同志，为了保证煤焦运输任务的完成，虚心地向同志们学习，并与市先进生产者徐鉴清同志和八号轮的全体职工创造出了“活动拖绳，上、下滩转拖长拖法、飞蛾纤须”等一套战胜枯水的经验，进一步解决了“灵活，多拖，安全”的关键问题，曾华轩同志由于认真采取了这些先进操作方法，先后创造拖驳十六、十九、二十、二十一只的新纪录。真是
  “嘉陵江上巨龙飞，枯水休想困长龙”。由于战胜了嘉陵江的水枯漕窄等困难，确保了钢厂煤焦需要。
    高山有顶，生产跃进可没有顶。海宽有边，挖掘运输潜力是无止境的。水上交通运输公司的职工们将树更大的雄心大志，永不骄傲，高举毛泽东思想红旗，再鼓干劲，天天向上，不断地迈进。
