Xinhua News Agency, June 23rd: The entire Chinese People's Liberation Army has extensively launched the "Propaganda Week Against US Imperialist Aggression, Resolutely Liberate Taiwan, and Defend World Peace" campaign. Broad masses of officers and soldiers, at their fighting posts, in barracks, and in streets, communes, schools and factories, are using diverse methods to carry out propaganda, fully exposing the aggressive nature of US imperialism and puncturing the paper tiger image of US imperialism.

Cultural troupes and amateur soldier performance teams from all services and arms of the PLA, as well as garrisons in major cities, have in recent days organized propaganda teams and staged performances with themes of opposing US imperialist aggression, including choruses, rhyming stories, dances, living newspapers, and folk arts. Units in Beijing, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Jinan, Kunming and other locations have organized street propaganda teams composed of cultural troupes, cadres, and soldiers, who perform in the streets. One street propaganda team organized by the Naval Cultural Troupe and sailors has over 250 members. Air Force propaganda teams are conducting propaganda performances in market towns and communes near airports; the Navy is doing the same in ports and wharves. Propaganda teams jointly organized by cadres, soldiers, and cultural troupe members of the Railway Corps are also performing in markets and residential areas where they are stationed. When officers and soldiers of a certain artillery unit went to the countryside to help the masses harvest wheat, they organized a propaganda team in the wheat fields, propagandizing to the masses while harvesting.

The propaganda activities against US imperialist aggression in all PLA units are in full swing. In army barracks, on naval warships, on air force airfields, and in anti-aircraft artillery positions, large-character slogans such as "US Imperialism Get Out of Asia!" and "Get Out of Taiwan!" and giant cartoons are posted everywhere. An engineering corps unit has drawn more than 80 cartoons exposing the paper tiger nature of US imperialism in the past few days. The Anti-US, Aid-Korea section of the military history exhibition hall in the Shenyang military region club has been opened to the public. The army's radio broadcasts, movies, slideshows, and blackboards are all being used to denounce US imperialist crimes of aggression. In the past few days, officers and soldiers of a certain unit on Hainan Island have written more than 1,500 big-character posters, angrily condemning Eisenhower's visit to Asia to plot new wars. Officers and soldiers of various units have written poems, composed songs, and created paintings to verbally and literally denounce US imperialism.

Garrisons in various places have also held anti-US imperialist report meetings, lecture meetings, and forums. The artillery leadership organs and directly subordinate units have held two report meetings of 700 and 500 people respectively, and also invited Hu Dean, a heroic artilleryman from the 1958 Jinmen artillery battle, to report on how the brave People's Liberation Army front-line artillery angrily opened fire to punish the enemy when US warships escorted the Jiang army.
