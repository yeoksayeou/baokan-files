Xinhua News Agency, 14th Dispatch: Amidst the global anti-American chorus, the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world, the chieftain of imperialism, U.S. President Eisenhower, has begun his so-called “visit” to the Far East. The areas of Eisenhower's activities—the Philippines, Japan, South Korea, Okinawa, and our country's Taiwan, which is occupied by U.S. imperialism—are all locations of major U.S. imperialist military bases in the Far East. Kyodo News called Eisenhower's activities as having "the color of inspecting the Far East front line." This shows that Eisenhower's trip is intended to intensify the arms race and war preparations in the Far East, create tension, and further enslave the people of these regions.

U.S. imperialism, in order to achieve its goal of enslaving the people of the world, has established military bases all over the world in an attempt to encircle socialist countries. These bases form two large arcs. The first large arc is in Western Europe, extending from Norway to Turkey, and the second large arc is in the Far East, extending from Alaska to Pakistan. In the areas of Eisenhower's activities, there are more than three hundred military bases of all sizes, with more than two hundred and fifty in Japan alone. Major Japanese ports such as Yokosuka, Sasebo, Yokohama, and Kobe have become U.S. naval bases. The "Akahata" revealed that the U.S. Air Force stationed in Japan completely controls the skies of Japan.

The U.S. military has established eight missile bases, more than ten air force bases, and two naval bases on Okinawa Island.

The U.S. military bases in the Philippines total twenty-three, the main ones being Clark Air Base, Subic Bay Naval Base, and the Sangley Point Base near Manila. According to the agreement, the United States can also use several other bases when it deems it "militarily necessary." The United States is currently stepping up the establishment of missile bases in the Philippines.

In South Korea, there are American missile bases and air and naval bases almost everywhere. These bases occupy a total of 100,000 cho (1 cho equals 15 mu) of cultivated land, and there are nearly 50,000 U.S. military officers and soldiers stationed in South Korea. To cooperate with Eisenhower's visit, the U.S. Third Marine Division stationed in Okinawa will conduct an amphibious exercise with the South Korean puppet army in Pohang, South Korea, in mid-June to display its "military prowess."

The United States still occupies China's territory of Taiwan, constantly infringing upon China's territorial waters and airspace, carrying out military provocations and war threats.

The aggressive spearhead of U.S. imperialism, which establishes military bases everywhere, is mainly aimed at China, the Soviet Union, and other socialist countries, but the first to suffer are the people of countries and regions where U.S. military bases are built. In countries where the United States establishes military bases, sovereignty is severely violated. In the recent struggle of South Korea against the Syngman Rhee fascist regime, the U.S. military in Korea carried out shameless interference and arrested thousands of Korean patriots. Wherever U.S. soldiers go, they commit all kinds of evil, and the people are often murdered and persecuted. In the past seven years, there have been approximately 66,000 documented cases of various crimes committed by U.S. soldiers in Japan, averaging twenty-nine cases per day. From 1951 to 1959, there were 3,305 incidents of Okinawan residents suffering from U.S. military disasters. U.S. military personnel stationed in the Philippines have also committed all kinds of atrocities, including murder, robbery, and rape. U.S. military personnel also use military bases to engage in black market business on a large scale. The local economy has been severely damaged. The crimes committed by U.S. soldiers in South Korea are even more uncountable. From January to November 1959, 1,276 South Korean residents died in car accidents, most of whom were killed by U.S. military vehicles. Some Korean children and elderly people were also shot dead by U.S. soldiers as "live targets." In the first four months of 1959, the U.S. military committed 102 atrocities such as murder, robbery, and rape. The U.S. military in Korea has occupied a large amount of civilian land, causing many farmers to be displaced and unable to make a living. The 90 members of the Wen family in Yuantun Village, Okgu County, North Jeolla Province, had to wander around begging because the land they cultivated was forcibly occupied by the U.S. military to build an airport. Six of the 90 people have starved to death.

The frantic establishment of military bases by U.S. imperialism everywhere has aroused resolute struggles by people in various regions against U.S. imperialism. The recent anti-American patriotic struggle of the Japanese people has reached an unprecedented climax. The vast people of Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, and Okinawa have either launched fierce anti-American struggles or are preparing to teach Eisenhower a good lesson when he arrives. U.S. imperialism is mired in a chorus of enemies on all sides, and every military base it establishes is a noose around its neck.

    准备侵略战争　奴役各国人民
    美国在远东设置大量军事基地
    新华社14日讯　在世界各地一片反美声中，全世界人民最凶恶的敌人，帝国主义的头子美国总统艾森豪威尔开始作所谓远东“访问”。艾森豪威尔这次活动的地区——菲律宾、日本、南朝鲜、冲绳以及被美帝国主义霸占着的我国的台湾等地都是美帝国主义在远东主要军事基地的所在地。共同社称艾森豪威尔这次活动具有“视察远东前线的色彩”。这就表明艾森豪威尔此行是要在远东地区加紧扩军备战，制造紧张局势，进一步奴役这些地区人民。
    美帝国主义为了达到它奴役全世界人民的目的，在世界各地到处建立军事基地，企图包围社会主义国家。这些基地形成两个大弧形。第一个大弧形在西欧，从挪威伸延至土耳其，第二个大弧形在远东，从阿拉斯加延长至巴基斯坦。在这次艾森豪威尔活动的地区里，大大小小有三百多个军事基地，仅在日本就有二百五十多个。日本的主要港口横须贺、佐世保、横滨、神户等都成了美国海军基地。美国空军基地几乎遍布日本各地。“赤旗报”揭露说，驻日美国空军完全控制着日本的天空。
    美军在冲绳岛建立了八个导弹基地，十多个空军基地和两个海军基地。
    美国在菲律宾的军事基地共有二十三个，主要的有克拉克空军基地、苏比克湾海军基地和在马尼拉附近的桑莱岬基地等。根据协定，在美国认为“军事需要时”还可使用其他若干基地。美国目前正加紧在菲律宾建立导弹基地。
    在南朝鲜，几乎到处都有美国的导弹基地和空、海军基地。这些基地共霸占耕地十万町步（每町步合十五市亩），驻在南朝鲜的美军官兵近五万人。为了配合艾森豪威尔的访问，美国驻冲绳的第三海军陆战师将于本月中旬同南朝鲜傀儡军队在南朝鲜浦项举行海陆军的两栖演习，以显示其“穷兵黩武”的力量。
    美国迄今仍然霸占着中国领土台湾，不断侵犯中国的领海和领空的主权，进行军事挑衅和战争威胁。
    美帝国主义到处建立军事基地，它的侵略矛头主要是针对中、苏和其它社会主义国家，但是首先遭殃的是建有美国军事基地的国家和地方的人民。在美国建立军事基地的国家，主权遭到严重侵犯。在这次南朝鲜反对李承晚法西斯政权的斗争中，侵朝美军就进行了无耻的干涉，逮捕了上千名朝鲜爱国者。美国大兵所到之处，无恶不作，人民经常遭到残杀和迫害。七年来，美国军人在日本所犯的各种罪行有案可查的就约有六万六千件，每天平均有二十九件。从1951年到1959年冲绳岛居民遭受美军祸害事件也有三千三百零五起。美国驻菲律宾的军人也做尽了坏事，杀人、抢劫、强奸妇女等无所不为。美国军人还利用军事基地大做黑市生意。当地的经济受到严重损害。美国兵在南朝鲜所犯的罪行更是无法统计。1959年1月到11月，南朝鲜居民由于车祸丧命的就有一千二百七十六人；大部分是美国军车撞死的。有的朝鲜儿童和老人走路也被美国兵当“活靶”打死。1959年头四个月内，美军所犯杀人越货，强奸妇女等暴行达一百零二起。侵朝美军占用了大量民田，使许多农民流离失所，无以为生。全罗北道沃沟群渊里农民文姓一族九十人由于他们耕种的土地被美军强占修了机场，不得不到处流浪，乞讨度日，九十人中已有六人饿死。
    美帝国主义到处疯狂地建立军事基地，引起了各地人民反对美帝国主义的坚决斗争。日本人民最近的反美爱国的斗争已达到空前高潮。日本、菲律宾、南朝鲜和冲绳的广大人民，有的早已展开猛烈的反美斗争，有的正准备在艾森豪威尔到达时好好地教训他一顿。美帝国主义已陷于四面楚歌声中，它所建立的每个军事基地都是它套在自己脖子上的绞索。
