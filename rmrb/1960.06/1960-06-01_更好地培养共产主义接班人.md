"June 1st" International Children's Day is here. Hundreds of millions of children in the motherland are growing up healthily under the care of the Party and the state. From Heilongjiang to Hainan Island, from the coast of the East China Sea to the Tibetan Plateau, the red flags of the "Young Pioneers" are flying everywhere, shouting the slogan "Always be prepared." On this joyous festival, we extend warm congratulations to the children all over the motherland and pay tribute to the children's workers across the country.
Children are the successors to communism and the flowers of the motherland. The Party and the state are very concerned about the growth of children. Our great leader Comrade Mao Zedong earnestly taught children to "study hard," "make progress every day," and "children unite and be masters of the new China." Our Party and the state have prepared good conditions as much as possible to enable our children to grow up healthily in terms of moral, intellectual, and physical education.
Since liberation, while vigorously developing school education, the Party and the state have paid attention to the development of preschool education and have established nurseries and kindergartens. However, due to the economic and cultural backwardness left over from old China, it was impossible for China's child care and education to develop greatly before the all-round Great Leap Forward in 1958. Since 1958, the Chinese people have held high the three red flags of the general line of socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, and have achieved unprecedented great victories on all fronts of socialist construction and socialist revolution. Nurseries and kindergartens have been established in urban and rural areas on a large scale, and tens of millions of children have received social education. Preschool child care has developed into a large-scale social undertaking. Social collective education has great advantages over family-based decentralized education. It can meet the needs of children of different ages, adjust their diets, cultivate good living habits, and conduct communist education in many ways, so that children can develop comprehensively in body and mind. At the same time, the Party and the state have implemented the policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, and have run education on a large scale by "walking on two legs." More than 90 million children have entered primary schools. Various sectors of society have established extracurricular children's education institutions to manage children's extracurricular learning, work, and life, and have gradually realized extracurricular social education. With the unprecedented development of children's care and education, a contingent of children's workers who are both red and expert has also gradually formed. All of this shows that China's child care and education has entered a new period of comprehensive development.
At present, urban people's communes are being established on a large scale across the country, and rural people's communes are developing and consolidating. The broad masses of women have participated in production, and various living service institutions have been universally established. The socialization of children's care and education has become a common requirement of the broad masses of people. The development of China's collective welfare undertakings for children has liberated the vast female labor force, given full play to the labor enthusiasm of parents, promoted the development of productive forces, and promoted the consolidation and improvement of urban and rural people's communes, and also prepared conditions for promoting the teaching reform of middle and primary schools. Conversely, the rapid development of productive forces and the growth of other factors have promoted the greater development and improvement of children's undertakings. In order to further improve children's care and education and enable it to play a better role in socialist construction, we should actively and gradually implement the policy of social education as the main form, combining social education with family education, publicize the superiority of collective child care through practical examples, vigorously promote the more rapid development and improvement of nurseries and kindergartens, and vigorously promote the development of social organizations for extracurricular children's education.
In order to adapt to the new situation of the all-round leap forward in socialist construction, and in order to cultivate successors to the socialist and communist cause, the Party requires us to better cultivate and educate children, so that they can grow up to become laborers with communist consciousness and culture, and grow into a new generation of people who dare to think, dare to speak, dare to do, dare to innovate and create, and dare to adhere to the truth and have a communist style. At present, the communist moral qualities of Chinese children have been greatly improved. We should continue to adopt various methods to strengthen communist education for children according to their characteristics. We must educate them to love the Party, love the leader, love the motherland, love socialism, love the people's communes, love the people, love labor, love science, and love public property. In the work of conducting communist education for children, it is also necessary to continue to overcome the bourgeois views and methods of children's education that are divorced from proletarian politics, divorced from production, and divorced from reality. For example, some people have used the excuse that children in the new China have not been affected by the reactionary classes to oppose communist education, especially class education, among children. This is wrong. It should be known that although the vast majority of today's children grow up in the new China and are brought up under the care of the Party, there are still classes and class struggle in our country, and the traditional habits of the old society will still have an impact on children. We must strengthen communist education for children and help them resist the corrosion of bourgeois ideology so that they can grow up healthily. The practice of only using animal stories such as kittens and puppies to educate children is obviously far from enough. Children demand to know more about social struggle and natural struggle, and demand to distinguish between the enemy and us and right and wrong. Therefore, we must educate children with more stories of revolutionary struggle and heroic and model deeds in real life, combine the cultivation and education of children with political struggle and productive labor, and organize children to participate in appropriate productive labor and necessary social and political life within their capacity. While actively carrying out teaching reform and imparting modern knowledge to children quickly, well, and economically, schools should lead young people and children into actual struggle to receive education and cultivate them to have the noble qualities of benefiting society and serving the people from an early age.
Children are in a period of physical and intellectual growth. The Party and the state require them to study well and be in good health. The children of our time are very enthusiastic about learning, work, and productive labor because they have been educated in socialism and communism. An important responsibility of children's workers is to help them arrange their studies, work, labor, and rest in accordance with the principle of combining work and rest, and to ensure that children have sufficient sleep and rest time, so as to better promote the healthy growth and all-round development of children's bodies and minds. Relevant leaders should also pay attention to the combination of work and rest for children's workers and ensure that they have enough time to study and rest. This will also help to further improve children's care and education.
The broad masses of children's workers are the implementers and embodiments of the Party's policies and guidelines for children's work. Most of them are ideologically red, energetic, adhere to the socialist and communist educational principles, study diligently, and constantly improve the quality of their work. Their work has been successful. The Party and the people entrust the children to the children's workers, which is an extremely glorious task for the children's workers. The hard work of the children's workers has been respected by the people. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the All-China Women's Federation, and the National Committee for the Protection of Children of the Chinese People jointly rewarded 10,000 advanced collectives and advanced children's workers before this year's "June 1st" Children's Day, including advanced collectives in various aspects of children's work, advanced child care workers, educators, primary school teachers, Young Pioneer instructors, medical staff related to children, model cadres, teachers and students of kindergarten teachers' colleges and nursing schools, and advanced workers in other aspects of children's work. This is the greatest honor given to them by the Party and the people, and also a major encouragement to children's workers in various aspects. All children's workers must value their work more and better shoulder the important responsibility of cultivating a new generation of communists.
Chinese children are happy "Red Scarves" today, and tomorrow they will be red flag bearers in building socialism and communism. The cause of cultivating children is a major cause related to the growth of the new generation of communism. Everyone should care and everyone should take action to do a better job in children's care and education. Let hundreds of millions of children across the country hold high the three red flags of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, and grow together with the leap forward of the motherland!

### 更好地培养共产主义接班人

    更好地培养共产主义接班人
    “六一”国际儿童节到来了。祖国亿万儿童，在党和国家的抚育下，正在茁壮成长。从黑龙江到海南岛，从东海之滨到西藏高原，到处飘扬着“星星火炬”的红旗，高呼着“时刻准备着”的口号。在这个欢乐的节日里，我们向祖国各地儿童致以热烈的祝贺，向全国儿童工作者致以敬意。
    儿童是共产主义的接班人，是祖国的花朵。党和国家十分关怀儿童的成长。我们伟大的领袖毛泽东同志殷切地教导儿童要“好好学习”，“天天向上”，“儿童们团结起来，做新中国的主人。”我们的党和国家，尽一切可能准备了良好的条件，使我国儿童在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到健康的成长。
    解放以来，党和国家在大力发展学校教育的同时，注意了发展学龄前儿童教育，举办托儿所、幼儿园。但由于旧中国遗留下来的经济和文化十分落后，在1958年全面大跃进以前，我国儿童的保育和教育工作，还不可能有很大的发展。1958年以来，我国人民高举社会主义建设总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，在社会主义建设和社会主义革命的各条战线上取得了空前伟大的胜利，城乡大办托儿所、幼儿园，几千万儿童受到了社会教养，学龄前儿童的保育工作已经发展成为大规模的社会事业。社会集体教养比起一家一户地分散教养，有着极大的优越性。它可以适合不同年龄儿童的需要，调剂饮食，养成良好的生活习惯，还可以多方面进行共产主义教育，使儿童身心得到全面的发展。同时，党和国家贯彻执行了教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，用“两条腿走路”的方法大办教育事业，九千多万儿童上了小学。社会各方面举办了校外儿童教育机构，把儿童校外的学习、劳动、生活管起来，逐步实现了校外的社会教育。随着儿童保育、教育事业的空前发展，一支又红又专的儿童工作者的队伍也逐步形成起来。所有这一切，都说明我国儿童的保育和教育事业，已经进入了一个全面发展的新的时期。
    目前，全国各地大办城市人民公社，农村人民公社正在巩固地发展，广大妇女参加了生产，各种生活服务机构普遍设立，儿童保育、教育事业的社会化已经成为广大人民的共同要求。我国儿童集体福利事业的发展，解放了广大的妇女劳动力，充分地发挥父母的劳动积极性，促进了生产力的发展，促进了城乡人民公社的巩固和提高，也为促进中、小学的教学改革准备了条件。反过来，生产力的迅速发展以及其它因素的成长，又促进了儿童事业的更加发展和提高。为了进一步提高儿童的保育和教育工作，使它对社会主义建设发挥更好的作用，我们应该积极地逐步地贯彻执行以社会教育为主、社会教育同家庭教育相结合的方针，通过实际事例宣传集体教养儿童的优越性，大力促进托儿所、幼儿园更加迅速地发展和提高，大力促进校外儿童教育的社会组织的发展。
    为了适应社会主义建设全面跃进的新形势，为了培养社会主义和共产主义事业的接班人，党要求我们更好地培养教育儿童，使他们长大成为有共产主义觉悟、有文化的劳动者，成长为敢想敢说敢做、敢于革新创造、敢于坚持真理的具有共产主义风格的一代新人。现在，我国儿童的共产主义道德品质，已经有了很大的提高。我们应当根据儿童的特点，继续采取各种方法，加强对儿童的共产主义教育。要教育他们热爱党，热爱领袖，热爱祖国，热爱社会主义，热爱人民公社，热爱人民，热爱劳动，热爱科学和热爱公共财产。在向儿童进行共产主义教育的工作中，还需要继续克服那种脱离无产阶级政治、脱离生产、脱离实际的资产阶级的儿童教育观点和方法。譬如有人曾借口新中国的儿童没有受到反动阶级的影响，反对在儿童中进行共产主义教育，特别是阶级教育。这是不对的。要知道，今天的儿童虽然绝大多数生长在新中国，是在党的抚育下成长起来的，但是我国还有阶级存在，还有阶级斗争，旧社会的传统习惯势力，还会对儿童发生影响。我们必须加强对儿童的共产主义教育，帮助他们抵制资产阶级思想的侵蚀，使他们得到健康的成长。那种只限于以小猫小狗一类动物故事来教育儿童的作法，显然是大大不够了。儿童要求更多地了解社会斗争和自然斗争，要求分清敌我和是非。因此，我们要以更多的现实生活中的革命斗争故事和英雄模范事迹来教育儿童，把儿童的培养教育工作和政治斗争、生产劳动结合起来，组织儿童参加力所能及的适当的生产劳动和必要的社会政治生活。学校要在积极进行教学改革、多快好省地向儿童传授现代知识的同时，把少年儿童带领到实际斗争中去受教育，培养他们从小就具有为社会造福、为人民服务的高尚品质。
    儿童正处在长身体、长知识的时期，党和国家既要求他们学习好、也要求他们身体好。我们时代的儿童，由于受到社会主义和共产主义的教育，学习、工作和生产劳动的热情都是很高的。儿童工作者的一项重要责任，就是要按照劳逸结合的原则，帮助他们安排好学习、工作、劳动和休息，保证儿童有足够的睡眠时间和休息时间，以便更好地促进儿童身心的健康成长和全面发展。有关领导方面也要注意到儿童工作者的劳逸结合，保证他们有足够的时间来进修和休息。这样，也就更有助于进一步把儿童的保育和教育事业办好。
    广大的儿童工作者是党的儿童工作政策方针的执行者和体现者。他们当中大多数人都是思想红，干劲足，坚持社会主义、共产主义的教育原则，刻苦钻研，不断地提高工作质量。他们的工作是有成绩的。党和人民把儿童委托给儿童工作者，这对儿童工作者来说，是极其光荣的任务。儿童工作者们的辛勤工作，受到了人民的尊敬。全国总工会、共青团中央、全国妇联、中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会四个团体，在今年“六一”儿童节前夕，联名奖励了一万名儿童工作先进集体和先进儿童工作者，包括各个方面的儿童工作的先进集体，先进的保育员、教养员、小学教师、少先队辅导员，有关儿童的医护人员，幼儿师范、保育护士学校的模范干部、教师和学生，以及其他各方面儿童工作的先进工作者。这是党和人民给予他们的最大荣誉，也是给予各个方面儿童工作者的重大鼓励。全体儿童工作者要更加看重自己的工作，更好地把培养共产主义一代新人的重大责任担当起来。
    我国儿童，今天是幸福的“红领巾”，明天就是建设社会主义和共产主义的红旗手。培养儿童的事业，是关系到共产主义新的一代的成长的重大事业。大家都来关心，大家都来动手，一定要把儿童的保育、教育事业办得更好。让全国亿万儿童，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，随着祖国大跃进的步伐一齐成长吧！
