Xinhua News Agency, Santa Clara, Cuba, June 22nd: The Chinese Art Troupe gave its tenth performance since visiting Cuba last night at the gymnasium hall here, to 5,000 enthusiastic spectators.

Two hours before the performance, people were already waiting at the entrance of the gymnasium. The performance began with the national anthems of Cuba and the People's Republic of China. The audience shouted slogans: "Cuba, yes! Yankees, no!" "Long live China!" "Mao Zedong!" The atmosphere in the gymnasium hall was filled with warm friendship.

At the end of the performance, the entire audience stood up, applauded, and sang the "July 26th Movement March" for as long as ten minutes. Representatives of women from Santa Clara presented a Cuban flag to the Chinese Art Troupe. Many people were reluctant to leave when the performance ended. They went on stage to offer warm congratulations to the performers and exchanged souvenirs with them.

The Santa Clara Municipal Government and the revolutionary organizations of the city held a luncheon on the 21st to entertain the Chinese artists. The mayor said at the banquet that the Cuban people and the Chinese people are united and love each other because they suffered the same hardships in the past, and now both countries have taken their destiny into their own hands. He hoped that the cultural ties between the two peoples would become even closer in the future.

Chen Zhongjing, head of the Chinese Art Troupe, paid tribute to the heroic citizens of Santa Clara at the banquet. He said that the Cuban people's slogan, "Cuba, yes! Yankees, no!" is absolutely correct. Not only the Cuban people and 200 million Latin American people, but also 650 million Chinese people and the people of other countries in the world, strongly support this slogan. The days of imperialism are not good now. It is U.S. imperialism that is isolated, not the Cuban people, and victory belongs to the Cuban people. After Chen Zhongjing's speech, those present enthusiastically shouted "Beijing, Beijing!" "Mao Zedong, Mao Zedong!"

The Chinese Art Troupe left here on the morning of the 22nd to continue its performances in Matanzas.

    古巴人民欢迎中国艺术团
    圣克拉拉市五千观众为中古人民友谊热情欢呼
    据新华社古巴圣克拉拉市22日讯　中国艺术团21日晚间在这里的体育馆大厅向五千名热情的观众作访问古巴以来的第十次演出。
    人们在演出前两小时就等候在体育馆的门口。演出是在古巴和中华人民共和国国歌声中开始的。观众高呼口号：“要古巴，不要美国佬！”，“中国万岁！”“毛泽东！”体育馆大厅里洋溢着一片火热的友情。
    演出结束时，全体观众起立鼓掌并高唱“7月26日运动进行曲”，达十分钟之久。圣克拉拉妇女代表把一面古巴国旗赠送给中国艺术团。许多人在散场时还不愿离去，他们到舞台上向演员们热烈祝贺，并同他们交换纪念品。
    圣克拉拉市政府和这个城市的革命组织21日举行午宴，招待中国艺术家们。市长在宴会上讲话说，古巴人民和中国人民是团结一致的，互相热爱的，因为他们在过去遭受到同样的苦难，而现在两国都已把命运掌握在自己的手中。他希望两国人民将来的文化联系更加密切。
    中国艺术团团长陈忠经在宴会上向英雄的圣克拉拉市民致敬。他说，古巴人民的口号：“要古巴，不要美国佬！”是完全正确的。不仅古巴人民和两亿拉丁美洲人民，而且还有六亿五千万中国人民以及世界其他各国人民，都有力地支持这个口号。现在帝国主义的日子很不好过。孤立的是美帝国主义而不是古巴人民，胜利属于古巴人民。陈忠经讲话结束后，在场的人们热烈高呼“北京、北京！”“毛泽东、毛泽东！”
    中国艺术团22日上午离开这里前往马坦萨斯继续举行演出。
