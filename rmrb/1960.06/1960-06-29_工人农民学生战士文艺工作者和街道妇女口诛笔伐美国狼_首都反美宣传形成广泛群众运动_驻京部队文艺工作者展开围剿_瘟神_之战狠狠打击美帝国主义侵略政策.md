Xinhua News Agency, 28th – The "Propaganda Week Against American Imperialist Aggression, Resolutely Liberate Taiwan, and Defend World Peace" in the capital has basically concluded. This unprecedented and large-scale mass anti-American struggle will continue to expand more deeply.

During this propaganda week, the broad masses of people from all walks of life in the capital expressed great indignation at the aggressive crimes of American imperialism and firm confidence in defending the motherland and resolutely liberating Taiwan. Over the past seven days, nearly 500,000 people in urban and rural areas of the capital watched anti-American films such as "Storm Over Asia" and the Korean film "Anti-Aircraft Shooting Group." More than 40 art troupes from Beijing, central ministries, military systems, and other places, as well as amateur art organizations of the masses, held various forms of art performances in factories, rural areas, schools, streets, military garrisons, and theaters. All theaters and cinemas staged anti-American plays, with millions of viewers. These performances formed one anti-American demonstration after another. Audiences and performers, young and old, raised their iron fists together and shouted in unison: "Down with American imperialism!", "Crush the aggressive and war policies of American imperialism!", "Long live world peace!"

The War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea Hall of the Chinese People's Revolution Military Museum concentrated on exposing the outwardly strong but inwardly weak paper tiger of American imperialism with more than 2,000 historical materials. The audience wrote in the guestbook: If the US imperialists dare to launch another war, they will be defeated even more miserably. People all over the world must ensure that they have no place to be buried.

During the propaganda week, large-scale art exhibitions and special anti-American radio programs were also held. Newspapers and periodicals published anti-American special pages and columns. Representatives of all strata of the people in the capital, famous poets, writers, and artists all took to the stage, verbally and in writing, to express the Chinese people's firm will to oppose American imperialist aggression, resolutely liberate Taiwan, and support the just anti-American struggles of the people of all countries.

The biggest characteristic of this anti-American propaganda week is that it has formed an unprecedentedly broad mass movement. The anti-American propaganda movement has rapidly expanded from professional art troupes performing in the streets and theaters to many grassroots units such as factories, mines, schools, and government offices. The broad masses of people, workers, peasants, students, soldiers, street women, and even children, held discussion meetings, posted big-character posters, wrote poems and paintings, and automatically participated in various literary and artistic propaganda activities. In the past few days, anti-American big-character posters, pictures, slogans, and the embarrassing appearance of the bandit leader Eisenhower could be seen everywhere in the windows of factories, workshops, farms, classrooms, and shops in Beijing. The Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Factory produced more than 3,000 anti-American poems and paintings in a few days, and more than 80% of the workers in many workshops picked up combat pens. More than 100 workers from the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory automatically organized a propaganda team and publicized and performed everywhere in the factory every night, exposing the conspiracy of American imperialism of false peace and real war preparation. Teachers and students of universities, middle schools, and primary schools such as Renmin University of China, Peking University, and the Central University for Nationalities have carried out anti-American propaganda through forums, reports, exhibitions, and art performances in recent days. The Central Conservatory of Music created more than 200 new anti-American songs in a short period of time and performed on the streets for four or five consecutive days. When the news of the downfall of the American imperialist lackey Nobusuke Kishi reached Tsinghua University, the students of the university immediately held a demonstration around the playground, and in less than five minutes, the demonstration team surged from more than 100 people to more than 1,000 people. Students of all ethnic groups from the Central University for Nationalities sang their newly composed song "Resolutely Bury the American Wolf" at the anti-American rally. Lin Qingchun, a graduate of the Gaoshan ethnic group from Taiwan, said: Our Taiwan compatriots, from the old to the young, know that they are Chinese, and have never heard of "two Chinas." For a hundred years, the Gaoshan compatriots have fought to the death with wooden sticks, stones, and even bare hands against the洋槍大炮 of imperialism. We must drive the American devils out of Taiwan. Medical workers at Peking Union Medical College Hospital, who have suffered deeply from American imperialist aggression and have seen with their own eyes American "doctors" using Chinese people as experimental products, have also denounced and exposed the bloody crimes of American imperialism in the form of big-character posters and forums. Qu Fuyou, an old waiter at the Beijing Hotel who had been beaten severely by the US military, stroked the scar on his nose and said: The days when the Chinese people were bullied by the American imperialists are long gone. The Chinese people are never afraid of American bandits. The peace-loving people of the world are not sleeping, we are all awake!

This newspaper also reports that the literary and art troupes and amateur performance teams of cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing have recently launched a large-scale campaign to encircle and suppress the "plague god." They use various art forms in various squares and streets to severely expose the gangster face of the "plague god" Eisenhower and severely attack the aggressive and war policies of American imperialism.

The literary and art troupes and amateur performance teams of various troops have all adapted Eisenhower's bandit trip and the unprecedented isolation of American imperialism in Asia into programs and brought them to the streets and squares. The General Political Department's political satire drama "Bandit Travel", the rhythmic storytelling "Rats Crossing the Street", Gao Yuanjun's allegro "Bombarding the Plague God", the Naval Cultural Troupe's living newspaper drama "Eisenhower, Get Out!" and the Air Force Cultural Troupe's Peking Opera "Eisenhower's Eastern Travel", the Beijing Military Region's Zhan You Cultural Troupe's "Fury Red on the Top of Mount Fuji", and the Beijing Artillery School's street drama "Asian People Expel the Plague God", the duo comic talk "Eisenhower's Confinement", etc., vividly portray the plight of the war "plague god" at the end of the road in Asia. An artillery student recited the poem "Salute Reception" to the crowd, exposing Eisenhower's embarrassed appearance after escaping from the wooden sticks and stones of the Filipino people and "visiting" Taiwan in a grey manner: "His soul has not settled, and he sees Taiwan again. The 'salutes' sound loudly, hitting him so hard that he is dizzy. He steps on Keelung with sorrow, and can only come and go in a hurry. He is very flustered, and the sound of artillery fire across the sea is booming."

In the past few days, the street propaganda teams of the capital troops participating in the battle to encircle and suppress the "plague god" have not only performed in the streets and squares of the city, but also carried out vigorous propaganda activities in the troops' garrisons, in front of department stores, in the threshing ground of the Yuyuantan Commune, in the villages and fields of Beiyuan.

    新华社28日讯　首都“反对美帝侵略、坚决解放台湾、保卫世界和平宣传周”活动已基本结束。这一规模空前、声势浩大的群众性反美斗争，将更加深入地继续扩展。
    在这次宣传周中，首都各阶层广大人民对美帝国主义的侵略罪行，表示莫大的激愤，对保卫祖国和坚决解放台湾，表示了坚定的信心。七天来，首都城乡近五十万人观看了“亚洲风暴”、朝鲜影片“对空射击组”等反美影片，北京市、中央各部、部队系统、各地来京的四十多个艺术团体和广大群众业余文艺组织，在工厂、农村、学校、街头、部队驻地以及剧场等处举行了各种形式的文艺演出，所有的剧场、影院都上演反美剧目，观众人次数以百万计。这些演出形成了一次又一次的反美大示威。扶老携幼的观众和演员们共举铁拳，同声高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！ ”，“粉碎美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策”，“世界和平万岁”。
    中国人民革命军事博物馆抗美援朝战争馆以二千多件史料，集中暴露了美帝国主义外强中干的纸老虎原形。观众们在留言簿上写道：如果美帝胆敢再次发动战争，就会败得更惨，全世界人民一定要让它死无葬身之地。
    宣传周中还举行了大型的美术展览、反美广播特别节目，各报刊出了反美专页、专栏，首都各阶层人民的代表、著名诗人、作家、艺术家人人上阵，口诛笔伐，表示出中国人民反对美帝侵略、坚决解放台湾、支持各国人民反美正义斗争的坚强意志。
    这次反美宣传周的最大特点是，它已经形成为一个空前广泛的群众运动。反美宣传运动已经由专业文艺团体在街头、剧场演出，迅速扩及到许多厂矿、学校、机关等基层单位。广大人民群众，工人、农民、学生、战士、街道妇女以至孩子们纷纷举行座谈会、贴大字报，写诗作画，并且自动参加各种文艺宣传活动。这几天，北京的工厂、车间、农场、教室和商店的橱窗里，到处可以看到反美的大字报、图片、标语以及强盗头子艾森豪威尔的狼狈相。北京第一机床厂几天内就出现了三千多首反美诗画，很多车间80％以上的职工都拿起了战斗的笔。北京农业机械厂一百多工人自动组织宣传队，每天晚上都在厂内各处宣传、表演，揭露美帝国主义假和平、真备战的阴谋。中国人民大学、北京大学、中央民族学院等大、中、小学师生，连日来通过座谈会、报告会、展览会和文艺演出等形式进行反美宣传。中央音乐学院短期内创作出二百多首新的反美歌曲，接连四五天上街演出。当美帝国主义走狗岸信介下台的消息传到清华大学时，这个大学的学生立即围着运动场举行了示威游行，不到五分钟游行队伍就由一百多人激增到一千多人。中央民族学院各族学生在反美集会上，同声高唱自己新编的歌曲“坚决埋葬美国狼”。台湾高山族毕业生林青春说：我们台湾同胞从老到小都知道自己是中国人，从来没听说过“两个中国”。高山族同胞百年来用木棍、石块甚至赤手空拳同帝国主义的洋枪大炮作殊死搏斗。我们一定要把美国鬼子赶出台湾去。深受美帝侵略毒害、亲眼看到过美国“医生”把中国人当作试验品的北京协和医院的医务工作者也纷纷以大字报、座谈会等形式，控诉和揭露美帝国主义人面兽心的血腥罪行。曾经受美军痛打过的北京饭店老服务员屈富有抚摸着鼻子上的伤痕说：中国人任凭美帝欺侮的日子早已经过去了。中国人绝不怕美国强盗。全世界爱好和平的人民并没有睡觉，咱们都醒着！
    本报讯　中国人民解放军驻北京部队陆海空军文工团和干部、战士业余演出队，近日来展开了一场规模宏大的围剿“瘟神”之战。他们在各个广场、街头，运用各种文艺形式，狠狠揭露“瘟神”艾森豪威尔的强盗嘴脸，狠狠打击美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策。
    各部队文工团和业余演出队，都把艾森豪威尔的强盗旅行和美帝国主义在亚洲的空前孤立，编成节目搬上街头、广场。总政治部文工团的政治讽刺剧“强盗旅行”、数来宝“老鼠过街”，高元钧的快书“炮轰瘟神”，海军文工团的活报剧“艾森豪威尔滚回去！”和空军文工团的京剧“艾森豪威尔东游记”，北京部队战友文工团的“富士山顶怒火红”，以及北京炮兵学校的街头剧“亚洲人民逐瘟神”、双簧“艾森豪威尔被困记”等等，把战争“瘟神”在亚洲日暮途穷的困境刻划得淋漓尽致。一个炮兵学员向人群朗诵了“礼炮迎送”的诗歌，揭露了艾森豪威尔从菲律宾人民的木棒、石块中脱身后，灰溜溜地到台湾“访问”的狼狈相：“惊魂未定，又见台湾影，‘礼炮’声声动地来，打得眼花头晕。含愁踏上基隆，只能来去匆匆，煞是心慌意乱，隔海炮声轰轰。”
    几天来，参加围剿“瘟神”之战的首都部队街头宣传队，不仅在市区的街头、广场演出，同时还在部队驻地，在百货商店门前，玉渊潭公社的麦场，北苑的村庄和田边，展开了热火朝天的宣传活动。（附图片）
