    Get-Together

    A few days ago, we went to the Sino-German Friendship People's Commune in the suburbs to help repair harvesters. After five days of hard work, a pile of harvesters that were about to become scrap were brought back to life. The commune members happily shook our hands, and specially held a get-together before we left. What kind of programs should we put on? Everyone thought, let's do more for our farmer brothers. Therefore, our first "performance" at the get-together was a lecture on "how to repair a broken harvester chain"; another program explained "what causes grain breakage." The commune's mechanics listened attentively and welcomed us to do another one. So we introduced "common sense for machine maintenance and upkeep." These programs were unexpectedly "popular" and won warm applause from the commune members. The head of the commune's mechanics department said, "The worker elder brothers have brought many valuable gifts to the commune, and we also hope they will take our regards back with them." As he spoke, he held up a rectangular flower mirror and gave it to us, with two lines of words written on it: "Let the flowers of worker-peasant cooperation bloom, and let the fruits of the worker-peasant leap forward be reaped." The next day, we left there with the deep friendship of our farmer brothers and went to another commune.

    联欢
    前几天，我们到郊区中德友好人民公社帮助修理收割机。经过五天奋战，一堆快要成废料的收割机复活了。社员们高兴地紧握住我们的手，临走时还专门举行了一次联欢会。我们出些什么节目呢？大家一想，还是为农民兄弟多做些事吧。因此，我们在联欢会上的第一个“演出”节目是讲“收割机的链子坏了如何修理”；另一个节目讲“麦粒破碎是什么原因”。公社的机械手听得很入神，都欢迎我们再来一个。于是我们又介绍了“机器的维护、保养常识”。这些节目都出乎意外的“叫座”，博得社员们的热烈掌声。公社机械部长说：“工人老大哥给社里送来了很多宝贵礼物，我们也希望他们把我们的心意带回去。”说着，他双手捧起一块长方形的花镜送给了我们，上面写着两行字：“开工农协作之花，结工农跃进之果”。第二天，我们带着农民弟兄深厚的友谊离开了那里，又赶到另外的公社去了。
