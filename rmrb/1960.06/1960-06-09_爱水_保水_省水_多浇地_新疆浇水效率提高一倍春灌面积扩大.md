    Love Water, Protect Water, Save Water, Irrigate More Land
    Xinjiang's Irrigation Efficiency Doubles, Spring Irrigation Area Expanded
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is carrying out a mass campaign to love water, protect water, and save water, increasing irrigation efficiency (acres irrigated per flow rate per day) by one time. The spring irrigation area has increased by more than 5 million mu compared with the same period last year, ensuring timely irrigation of various crops. In the main wheat-producing area of ​​southern Tianshan, wheat has been watered one to two times more than in the same period last year and has now begun to enter the booting stage. The wheat irrigation in the colder northern Xinjiang region is also timely and is now in the jointing stage.
    Xinjiang has little rain throughout the year and relies entirely on snowmelt for irrigation. Due to the cold spring this year and late snowmelt, the water volume of rivers in the region from February to April decreased by 10% to 30% compared to the past. However, the spring sowing area in the autonomous region has expanded by more than a quarter compared to previous years, and the area of ​​water-intensive rice has also increased significantly. Although a number of newly built water conservancy projects are playing a role this spring, expanding the irrigation area by more than 2.7 million mu, they still cannot adapt to the new situation of even greater increases in the sown area. Currently, winter wheat is in the booting and jointing stage, and field management of spring wheat, rapeseed, flax, early corn, and cotton has begun, making the contradiction of various crops competing for water very prominent.
    In order to ensure timely irrigation and a comprehensive harvest for various crops, all localities launched a mass campaign to love water, protect water, and save water through extensive publicity, mobilization, and careful calculation of water resources in mid-May. They also held an irrigation management shock month. Localities widely promoted the "three-determination" management method of fixed time, fixed land seedlings, and fixed water volume, organized irrigation management professional teams, scientifically allocated water volume, adopted furrow irrigation on the basis of land leveling and garden-style planting, eliminated string irrigation and uncontrolled irrigation, strengthened planned water use, and strived to return every drop of water to the fields to improve irrigation efficiency. After the launch of the water conservation movement, the average irrigation efficiency in the region has rapidly increased from less than 600 mu in the past to over 1,000 mu. Yingjisha County recently conducted a comprehensive inspection and repair of canals, sluice gates, and field ridges, ensuring that canals do not leak or evaporate excessively. One flow rate can irrigate more than 1,600 mu of land per day and night, guaranteeing timely irrigation of winter wheat, spring wheat, and oil crops. In the Yarkand River basin, Yecheng, Shache, and other five counties completed wheat jointing irrigation ten days to half a month earlier than last year. At the same time, due to the significant reduction in waste, the amount of water diverted per mu has not only decreased significantly compared to last year, but the quality of irrigation is also better than in previous years.
    While vigorously grasping irrigation management, all localities have adopted the method of assigning leaders, personnel, and land sections to strengthen the management and maintenance of existing and newly built water conservancy projects, improve and establish water conservancy management organizations at all levels, and make every effort to tap the potential of project water sources. In addition, all localities also used all conditions to dig wells and springs to increase water volume. The Dongfanghong People's Commune in Cele County, which has been short of water for years, extracted 50% of its labor force to dig more than 1,700 wells and spring eyes in half a month.
    Leaders at all levels in various localities attach great importance to the movement to love water, protect water, and save water. Hetian Prefecture put forward the slogan "Secretary on the canal mouth, cadres following the water, vigorously digging water sources, using water like oil." Many commune and management district general branch secretaries watered the fields with the masses during the day and stayed overnight by the canals to solve problems in a timely manner. In order to improve management levels and better conserve water, localities actively trained management personnel and leveled land as early as before spring planting. According to statistics from seven irrigation areas and Hetian Prefecture, 6.86 million mu of land has reached garden-style standards.

### 爱水　保水　省水　多浇地  新疆浇水效率提高一倍春灌面积扩大

    爱水　保水　省水　多浇地
    新疆浇水效率提高一倍春灌面积扩大
    据新华社讯　新疆维吾尔自治区各地开展全民性的爱水、保水、省水运动，浇水效率（一个流量一昼夜浇地亩数）提高一倍；春灌面积比去年同期增加五百多万亩，保证了各种作物的适时灌溉。自治区主要产麦区天山南部的小麦，比去年同期多浇一次到两次水，目前已开始孕穗；较寒的北疆地区的小麦灌溉也很及时，现在正在拔节。
    新疆终年少雨，全靠冰雪融水灌溉。由于今年春寒，积雪融化晚，境内各河流2至4月水量比过去减少10％到30％。但是自治区春播面积却比往年扩大四分之一以上，需水量多的水稻面积也增加很多。虽然有一批新修水利工程在今年春季发挥效益，可以扩大灌溉面积二百七十多万亩，仍不能适应播种面积增加更多的新形势。目前冬麦正在孕穗拔节，春麦、油菜、胡麻、早玉米、棉花的田间管理已经开始，各种作物争水的矛盾便十分突出。
    为了保证各种作物都能及时灌溉全面丰收，各地通过大宣传、大动员、大算水账，5月中旬迅速掀起了全民性的爱水、保水、省水运动，并举行了灌溉管理突击月。各地广泛推广定时间、定地苗、定水量的三定管理办法，组织灌溉管理专业队、科学分配用水量，在平整土地、园田化的基础上采取沟畦灌溉，消灭串灌、漫灌，加强计划用水，力求滴水归田，提高浇水效率。爱水、保水、省水运动开展后，全区平均浇水效率已由过去不到六百亩迅速提高到一千亩以上。英吉沙县最近全面检查、整修渠道、闸口和田埂，做到渠道不渗漏少蒸发，一个流量一昼夜能浇地一千六百多亩，保证了冬麦、春麦、油料作物的适时灌溉。叶尔羌河流域叶城、莎车等五个县的小麦拔节水比去年提前十天到半个月浇完。同时，由于浪费现象大大减少，每亩地的引水量不仅比去年减少很多，浇水质量也比往年要好。
    在狠抓灌溉管理的同时，各地都采取定领导、定人、定地段的办法，加强原有和新修水利工程的管理养护，健全和建立各级水利管理组织，千方百计挖掘工程水源潜力。此外，各地还利用一切条件掏井挖泉，增加水量。历年缺水的策勒县东方红人民公社抽出50％的劳力半月掏井挖泉眼一千七百多口。
    各地各级领导都极重视爱水、保水、省水运动。和田专区提出了“书记上渠口，干部跟水走，大力挖水源，用水如用油”的口号，许多公社和管理区总支书记白天同群众一起浇地，夜宿渠边及时解决问题。为了提高管理水平和更好地节约用水，早在春播前各地就积极训练管理人员和平整土地。据七个灌区和和田专区统计，已有六百八十六万亩土地达到园田化标准。
