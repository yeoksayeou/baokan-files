    Spreading Wings and Flying High
    Xin Jiagong, First Secretary of the CPC Chongqing Nan'an District Committee
    I and two comrades from the District Committee Office stepped onto the bustling and wide Shangxin Street, turned a corner, and arrived at the Nan'an Leather Factory. A row of shiny blackboards displayed the poems and articles of the workers. The carefully crafted blackboard newspaper editors added illustrations, decorating them with bright colors. It was truly a garden full of spring, an inspiring scene of a great leap forward atmosphere and a surging cultural tide.

    I stopped in front of a "Learning Corner," admiring the poems written by the workers. Comrade Liu Binghui, the party branch secretary of the factory, walked out from inside. I asked him whether the young and middle-aged people participating in the literacy campaign had all met the "four skills" standard after the re-examination. He replied firmly, "The young and middle-aged have all met the 'four skills' standard." After a pause, he continued, "Even the older workers who participated in the learning have reached the 'four skills' and have entered the higher primary school classes." From his answer, I could see that he could not suppress the joy in his heart. This factory was organized in 1952 by unemployed shoemakers under the leadership of the Party. Most of them were illiterate. Now every worker can read and write, can recognize, can write, can use, and can speak. What a remarkable thing this is!

    Master worker Gao Hanzhang was a bottom worker who originally could not even write his own name. In an anti-American and aid-Korea signature campaign, he asked someone else to sign for him. The other person looked at him and said, "Why don't you learn culture? You can't even write your own name!" These words stung his heart, and his face felt hot. He truly felt the difficulty of not having culture. News of the rapid progress and rapid changes in the socialist construction of the motherland came from the newspapers every day. As soon as the newspapers arrived, the workers rushed to read them, but Master Gao could not understand them. This also made him feel very uncomfortable.

    The development of production has put forward a new historical task for the workers: to master cultural and scientific knowledge, to arm their minds with culture and science, to reform technology, and to promote the continuous development of production. All of this made Master Gao deeply realize: without culture, one would be met with setbacks everywhere; without learning culture, one would lag behind. He resolutely expressed to the Party: "Although learning is difficult, I will drill into it even if it flattens my head!" With the urgent need to learn, coupled with a tenacious spirit, he was not afraid of any difficulties. In learning culture, Master Gao listened attentively in class, seized the time to review after class, and after work in the evening, he took the books home, lit the oil lamp, read for half an hour, and wrote for an hour, day after day, persisting for a long time. He marked the words he did not recognize with symbols and went back to the factory to ask other comrades for help. The leaders and comrades also enthusiastically helped him. Due to his firm will and tenacious study, he finally got rid of his illiteracy and is now a student in the higher primary school class.

    From Master Gao, we can see how urgent the workers and peasants are to learn culture, and how firm their steps are on the road of cultural revolution.

    The next afternoon, we drove to Danzishi, got out of the car and walked down a row of stone steps, passed through the clean and spotless streets and alleys, and turned around to arrive at the livestock products processing factory. Before we even entered the gate, a clear song came from the spring breeze. When we got inside, the song was accompanied by the erhu and flute, which was even clearer and more moving. "Where is this performance taking place?" I asked Comrade Huang Juncai, the party branch secretary of the factory, curiously. He told me that it was a group of newly literate workers who were rehearsing programs in the club after work, preparing to welcome the district's literacy cultural evening and report their achievements to the representatives. When we passed the front of the club door, the laughter inside attracted our footsteps. A comrade from the office told me, "In our district's technical revolution movement, there is a saying: wherever there is innovation, there is performance."

    I was thinking: the working people created culture, but it was taken away by the reactionary rulers. Workers and peasants, standing tall today, have broken their shackles, taken back their culture, taken their steps, opened their voices, and are running towards the future. Their footsteps shake the earth, and their songs float in the universe.

    Leaving the gate of the livestock products processing factory, passing through a small alley, a towering wooden frame appeared in front of us. That was the elevator of the Danzishi Grain Station. One had to look up to see the top. The grain was raised directly into the sky through the elevator tube, and then distributed to the processing workshop or warehouse for storage. When we went inside, we saw a central control station next to the elevator, which was full of red and green light bulbs, carrying out remote control. With the push of a button, the machine started to sound. This grain station has achieved a one-stop automated and linked production of transportation, storage, processing, and sales. Representatives from all over the country were sent to visit, and they expressed satisfaction after seeing it. When they learned that the realization of one-stop automated production was mainly created by several ordinary workers who had just become literate, they praised it even more. The "main general" who created this set of production automation was Comrade Li Maoqing, an excellent Communist Party member, a city and district advanced producer, and a worker who had just been promoted to technician. When the employees in the station were making winches in the technical revolution movement, according to the opinions of the designers, they had to demolish several houses and spend more than 300,000 yuan. Li Maoqing and several other workers disagreed. Relying on their limited cultural and technical knowledge, they liberated their minds, broke superstitions, and put forward a new suggestion. Not only did they not demolish the houses, but they only spent more than 5,000 yuan to successfully install a 210-meter-long winch. The station realized the transportation orbital, but because the terrain was narrow and there were too many turns, experts believed that the problem was difficult to solve. However, Comrade Li Maoqing and others created a wooden movable turntable, which solved the key problem of the wooden car turning. They also trial-produced separators and electric grain selling machines, realizing a dust-free and unmanned processing workshop. There are countless workers like Li Maoqing, who were intelligent and capable but had no culture in the past, and whose intelligence and talents could not be fully utilized.

    Culture is like a key. When it is in the hands of the working people, it can open the door of wisdom, arm people's minds, enlighten their thinking, and create miracles. The revolutionary workers and peasants have spread their wings of technical revolution and cultural revolution, soaring straight into the sky and flying to the communist paradise.

专栏：党委书记手记

    展翅高飞
    中共重庆市南岸区委第一书记　辛嘉功
    我和区委办公室的两个同志，踏上了热闹宽敞的上新街，转弯就到了南岸皮革厂。一排漆得发光的黑板，上面刊登着职工的诗歌和文章，精心的黑板报编辑给配上插图，点缀得色彩鲜明，图文并茂，真是满园春色，一片跃进气氛，一片文化高涨的动人景象。
    我走到一个“学习园地”跟前停下来，欣赏着工人所写的诗歌。厂党总支书记刘炳辉同志从里面走了出来，我问他参加扫盲学习的青壮年，经过再次测验，是否都符合“四会”标准。他斩钉截铁地回答我说：“青壮年都达到了‘四会’标准。”停了一下接着说：“就连参加学习的老工人也都达到了‘四会’，而且都进入了高小班学习。”从答话中，可以看出他压抑不住内心的喜悦。这个厂是在1952年由失业的皮鞋工人在党的领导下组织起来的，大多数都是文盲，现在每个工人都能读书写字，会认，会写，会用，会讲。这是一件多么了不起的大事呀！
    老师傅高汉章是个底工工人，原来连自己的名字都不会写。在一次抗美援朝签名运动中，他请别人替他签名，别人看了他一眼，说道：“你为什么不学文化，连自己的名字都写不起！”这句话刺痛了他的心，脸上觉得一阵火辣，确实感到了没有文化的困难。从此，下定决心学文化。祖国社会主义建设突飞猛进、日新月异的消息每天从报纸上传来；报纸一到，工人们即抢着阅读，而高老师傅却看不懂报纸。这也使他心里非常难受。
    生产的发展，给工人们提出了一个新的历史任务：掌握文化科学知识，用文化科学来武装头脑，改革技术，推动生产不断向前发展。这一切使高老师傅深深地体会到：没有文化到处碰壁，不学文化就要落后。他坚决地向党表示：“学习虽然有困难，我扁尖了脑壳也要钻进去！”有了学习的迫切要求，再加上顽强的钻劲，再大的困难他也不怕。高老师傅在学习文化中，上课专心听讲，下课抓紧时间复习，晚间下班后，把书本带回家去，点上油灯，读半小时的书，写一小时的字，天天如此，长期坚持了下来。认不得的字他就记上符号，回厂请教其他同志，领导上和同志们也热忱地帮助他。由于他坚韧的意志，顽强地钻研，终于摘掉了文盲帽子，现在已是高小班的学员了。
    从高老师傅身上，我们可以看到：工农群众学习文化的要求是多么迫切，在文化革命的道路上，步伐是多么坚定。
    第二天下午，我们驱车到弹子石，下车步行，走下一排石阶，经过干干净净、一尘不染的大街小巷，转弯抹角地来到了畜产品加工厂。还未进大门，迎面春风送来了嘹亮的歌声，到了屋里，歌声伴奏二胡、笛子，更加清晰，动人心弦。“这是哪里在表演？”我好奇地问厂党支部书记黄俊才同志。他告诉我，是一群刚脱盲的工人，下班后，在俱乐部里排演节目，准备迎接全区扫盲文艺晚会，向代表们汇报成绩。当我们经过俱乐部门前，里面的笑声吸住了我们的脚步。办公室的同志在旁告诉我：“我区技术革命运动中，出现了哪里有革新，哪里就有表演。”
    我在想：劳动人民创造了文化，但却被反动统治者抢走。工人、农民，今天昂然直立，斩断了枷锁，夺回了文化，迈开了步伐，打开了嗓门，奔向前途。他们的脚步声震响天地，他们的歌声飘荡在宇宙空间。
    走出畜产品加工厂的大门，穿过一条小巷，一个巍峨耸立，高插云霄的木架呈现在眼前，那是弹子石粮站的引升器，仰天落帽才能望到它的顶端。粮食通过引升管，直升到高空，然后分送到加工车间或仓库储存。我们到里面一看，引升器旁设置了一个中央控制台，上面安满了红绿色的灯泡，进行着远距离的操纵，一按电钮，机器就响动起来。这个粮站，已实现了运（输）、储（装）、加（工）、销（售）四线一条龙自动化、联动化生产。全国各地都派代表来参观，看后表示满意；当他们知道实现一条龙生产自动化，主要是几个刚脱盲不久的普通工人创造出来的时候，更是称赞不已。创造这一套生产自动化的“主将”，就是优秀共产党员，市、区先进生产者，刚由工人提拔为技术员的李茂清同志。站内职工在技术革命运动中大搞绞车时，按照设计人员的意见，要拆掉几幢房屋，花上三十多万元。李茂清和其他几个工人都不同意，他们凭着仅有的一点文化技术知识，解放了思想，破除了迷信，提出了一项新的建议，不仅未拆房子，而且只花了五千多元，就把长达二百一十米绞车安装成功了。站内实现运输轨道化，但因地势狭窄，转弯之处太多，专家都认为不好解决的问题，而李茂清等同志却创造了木质活动转盘，解决了木质车子转弯的关键问题。他们还试制出分离器、电动售粮器，实现了无尘、无人加工车间。像李茂清这样精明能干但过去没有文化，聪明才智不能充分发挥出来的工人，是举不胜举的。
    文化，就像一把钥匙，掌握在劳动人民手里，就能打开智慧的大门，武装人们的头脑，使思想开窍，创造出奇迹。革命的工农群众，展开了技术革命和文化革命的翅膀，直上云霄，飞向共产主义天堂。
