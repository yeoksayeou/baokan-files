    Henan Reaps and Threshes Wheat Carefully
    In Henan, after the basic completion of wheat harvesting, leading Party secretaries took charge, and the entire population mobilized to quickly launch a campaign to carefully reap and thresh again, ensuring that every grain was stored and every stalk was stacked.
    During the careful reaping and threshing campaign, various localities generally adopted the method of assigning areas to teams, blocks to groups, and rows to individuals, implementing a six-fixed responsibility system: fixed leadership, fixed labor, fixed tasks, fixed quality, fixed time, and fixed work points.
  Zhejiang Industrial and Commercial Departments Support Summer Harvesting and Planting
    Zhejiang's industrial and commercial departments are vigorously supporting summer harvesting and planting. Industrial and commercial departments in various localities have completed the manufacturing and promotion of new-style agricultural tools in terms of quantity, quality, and time. About 50% of the spring crops in the province were harvested and threshed using new-style tools. More than 20 factories, including Hangzhou Automobile Manufacturing Plant, Zhejiang Flax Mill, and Huafeng Paper Mill, were linked with more than 10 communes in the suburban areas of the city, actively supporting the communes' agricultural machinery repair and fitting capabilities. Various localities also formed a large number of iron, wood, and bamboo craftsmen, bringing their own tools and accessories to the fields for mobile repair and fitting, providing technical guidance while repairing.
      Shanxi Vigorously Collects Wild Plants
    Before the wheat harvest, some areas of Shanxi Province mobilized the masses to launch a concentrated effort to collect wild plants, achieving great harvests.
    Shanxi has many mountainous areas, and there are many wild plants that can be collected in the mountains during the summer and autumn seasons. After five days of concentrated effort, Licheng County collected more than three million jin of wild fibers, medicinal materials, spices, etc. Organizing people's communes to collect wild plants can not only solve the raw material needs of some commune-run industries and some market needs but also increase the income of the communes. For example, some communes in Yangquan City and Yuanqu County recently used lotus leaf shoots to make more than 40,000 jin of "tea."
      Huang Baolan Sets New Record for Machine Rice Planting
    National "March 8th Red Banner Pacesetter" and Guizhou Province's rice planting machine pacesetter, Huang Baolan, has set a new rice planting record this year. For more than half a month, she has been planting an average of more than 170,000 seedlings per day, with a qualification rate of over 98%, an increase of more than 70,000 seedlings compared to the more than 97,000 seedlings planted per day last year. More than 180,000 rice planting machine operators in Tongren Prefecture have launched a surging wave of learning from, catching up with, and surpassing Huang Baolan.
      Madoi County at the Source of the Yellow River is a Fish Reservoir
    Madoi County, at the source of the Yellow River, is being built into a fishery base in Qinghai Province. Madoi County is nearly 4,000 meters above sea level, with crisscrossing rivers and scattered lakes, including large lakes such as Gyaring Lake, Ngoring Lake, Black Sea, Xingxinghai, and Starry Sea. It has very rich fish resources, including big-headed naked carp, small-mouthed naked carp, mottled fish, and carp. At the same time, there are small shrimp, locally called "dog shrimp," in the Black Sea. The fish here are generally more than a foot long, weighing three or four jin, with tender meat and fat, and delicious taste.
      Linxian Combines Drought Resistance with Large-Scale Construction of "Three Fields"
    The people of Linxian County, Shanxi Province, are combining drought resistance with large-scale construction of "Three Fields." The "Three Fields" are: based on ensuring paddy fields and with high-yield plots as the core, establishing insurance fields with a yield of more than 400 jin per mu, capable of "guaranteeing a bumper harvest even without rain for a year"; based on semi-irrigated land, dam land, and low-lying land under river terraces and with high-yield ditches as the core, establishing moisture-retaining fields with a yield of more than 200 jin per mu, capable of "guaranteeing a ten percent harvest even without rain for a year"; and based on horizontal terrace fields and with high-yield ridges as the core, relying on water storage projects such as drought wells to carry water for spot planting, guaranteeing seed preservation fields that "guarantee full seedlings even without rain in the spring."
    After Linxian County put forward the call to establish the "Three Fields," in just about a month, the entire county built 240,000 mu of insurance fields, 320,000 mu of moisture-retaining fields, and 680,000 mu of seed preservation fields.

    河南复收细打小麦
    河南各地在小麦收割基本结束的基础上，书记挂帅，全民行动，迅速掀起了一个复收细打，颗粒归仓，寸草归垛的运动。
    在精收细打运动中，各地普遍采取了以队包片、组包块、人包垅的办法，实行定领导、定劳力、定任务、定质量、定时间、定工分的六定责任制。
  浙江工商部门支援夏收夏种
    浙江工商部门大力支援夏收夏种。各地工商部门按量、按质、按时地完成新式农具制造和推广任务。全省春花作物约有50％使用新式工具收割和脱粒。杭州市汽车制造厂、浙江麻纺厂、华丰造纸厂等二十多个工厂和市郊区十多个公社挂钩，积极支援公社农业机械修配力量。各地还组成大批铁、木、篾技工，自带工具配件，到田头巡回修配，边修理、边作技术辅导。
      山西大采野生植物
    山西省部分地区在麦收前曾发动群众上山突击采集了一次野生植物，收获很大。
    山西山地较多，山上夏、秋两季都有许多可以采集的野生植物。黎城县经过五天突击，采集了野生纤维、药材、香料等三百多万斤。组织人民公社采集野生植物，既可解决一部分社办工业原料和一部分市场的需要，又可增加公社的收入。如阳泉市和垣曲县的一些公社最近就利用莲条嫩叶制成“茶叶”四万多斤。
      黄宝兰再创机插秧新纪录
    全国“‘三八’红旗手”、贵州省插秧机标兵黄宝兰，今年又创插秧新纪录。她在持续半月以上的时间内，平均日插十七万多窝，合格率达98％以上，比去年日插九万七千多窝提高七万多窝。铜仁专区十八万多名插秧机手，已掀起了风起云涌的学、赶、超黄宝兰的热潮。
      黄河源头上的玛多县是个鱼库
    黄河源头上的玛多县，正在建设成为青海省的一个渔业基地。玛多县拔海近四千米，境内河流纵横，湖泊星罗棋布，较大的湖泊有扎陵湖、鄂陵湖、黑海、兴新海、星宿海等，鱼产资源非常丰富，有大头湟鱼、小嘴湟鱼、花鱼和鲤鱼等。同时，黑海里还有当地人们称为“狗虾”的小虾。这里的鱼一般身长一尺多，重三、四斤，肉嫩膘肥，味道鲜美。
      临县结合抗旱大建“三田”
    山西省临县人民结合抗旱，大建“三田”。三田是：以保证水田为基础，丰产方为核心，建立“一年无雨保丰收”的亩产四百斤以上的保险田；以半水地、坝地、川台下湿地为基础，丰产沟为核心，建立“一年无雨十成收”的亩产二百斤以上的保墒田；以水平梯田为基础，丰产梁为核心，靠旱井等蓄水工程担水点种的“一春无雨保全苗”的保种田。
    临县提出建立“三田”号召后，仅一个月左右的时间，全县就建起了保险田二十四万亩，保墒田三十二万亩，以及保种田六十八万亩。
