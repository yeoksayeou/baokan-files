    The Congo, which has always been called an "oasis of stability" by imperialism, is about to shake off 75 years of Belgian imperialist colonial rule and declare its independence on June 30 this year. This is a major victory in the Congolese people's long struggle for national independence.
    The impending independence of the Congolese people is the result of their long, tortuous, and heroic struggle. From the very first day of the colonialists' invasion of the Congo, the Congolese people launched heroic struggles against them. Despite the unprecedented barbaric massacres of the Congolese people by the Belgian colonialists, which reduced the Congolese population from 20 million in 1900 to about 12 million today, the Congolese people have not been intimidated. On the contrary, strikes, demonstrations, uprisings, etc., against Belgian colonial rule have sprung up one after another.
    After the Bandung Conference in 1955, and especially after the First All-African People's Conference in 1958, the Congolese people's struggle against Belgian colonial rule entered a new stage. In January 1959, Africans in Leopoldville took the lead in initiating the struggle. Within a few months, the struggle rapidly spread throughout the country, forming a massive and unprecedented mass movement. The Congolese working class, always at the forefront of the struggle, united the entire Congolese people in continuous struggle against the colonialists. From January to July last year alone, there were more than thirty mass demonstrations, parades, strikes, and protest rallies, each involving over ten thousand people, in various parts of the Congo. The Congolese people took up stones, bows and arrows, and spears to resist the armed suppression of the colonialists, demonstrating their staunch and unyielding heroic spirit.
    Faced with the irresistible tide of the Congolese people's demand for national independence, the Belgian colonialists, seeing that armed suppression was no longer effective, put forward a plan on October 16 last year for the so-called "phased independence" of the Congo within four years, attempting to paralyze the Congolese people's fighting spirit and strangle the Congolese national liberation movement. However, this conspiracy failed in the face of the awakened Congolese people. Last December, the Congo's local "elections," held according to this plan, suffered a shameful defeat under the Congolese people's resolute resistance. Through the heroic struggle of the Congolese people, the Belgian colonialists were finally forced to agree at the Belgian-Congolese Round Table Conference held in January this year that the Congo would achieve independence on June 30 this year.
    It is very clear that there is no question here of the Belgian colonialists suddenly becoming benevolent and voluntarily withdrawing from the Congolese colony. The Belgian colonialists, awed by the immense power of the Congolese people's increasingly high anti-colonialist struggle, had no choice but to make some temporary concessions in order to seize the opportunity to implement new conspiracies.
    Now, many facts show that the Belgian colonialists are by no means resigned to their defeat, and they are attempting to continue to maintain their colonial rule in the Congo in a disguised form. According to Western newspapers, the Belgian colonialists are attempting to continue to bring out the Belgian king politically to serve as the head of independent Congo, and are attempting to impose the so-called "Belgian-Congolese community" on the Congolese people. Recently, the Belgian colonialists planned a round table conference on the future of the Congo's economy, society, and finance. The conference passed eighteen resolutions to be submitted to the future Congolese government. These resolutions stipulate that the Congo will continue to maintain relations with the European "Common Market," the Congo's current "exchange management system" will remain unchanged, and Belgium and the Congo will carry out so-called "cooperation" in public and private affairs.... In a word, the Congo's finance and economy must still be controlled by Belgium. Militarily, the Belgian colonialists are trying to maintain their military bases in the Congo. Belgian Defense Minister Gilson openly stated that the Belgian government would not abandon its military bases in the Congo. The Belgian government not only refuses to hand over control of the Congolese army, but has also recently been sending troops from Belgium to the Congo. Currently, Belgium has three paratrooper battalions in the Congo, totaling 2,400 men. There are also about 20,000 colonial troops and a large number of colonial police.
    In addition, one of the despicable conspiracies being carried out by the Belgian colonialists is to divide the unity within the Congolese national independence movement, provoke tribal disputes, and even create bloody conflicts between Congolese people. The Belgian colonialists are attempting to split the rich Katanga province from the Congo in order to continue plundering the province's abundant mineral resources. In early March, the Belgian colonial authorities used the Conakat Party, which represents the interests of Belgian monopoly consortia in the province, to create a large-scale bloody conflict between Congolese people that resulted in hundreds of casualties. In the past month or so, more than fifteen bloody conflict incidents have occurred under the instigation of the colonialists. The Belgian colonialists are attempting to use the vicious method of creating tragedies of Congolese people killing each other in an attempt to prevent the Congolese people from achieving genuine independence.
    It is particularly worth pointing out that while the Belgian colonialists are plotting a sham independence conspiracy, US imperialism is also playing an insidious role in the Congo. On the one hand, it hypocritically expresses "sympathy" and "support" for Congolese "independence"; on the other hand, it supports the Belgian colonialists in carrying out repression and deception against the Congolese people. US military bases in Africa have been used to transport Belgian colonial troops to massacre the Congolese people. The US propaganda machine portrays the Belgian colonialists as "enlightened colonialists," while demanding that the Congolese people show "patience and reason." After the Congolese people forced the Belgian colonialists to agree to Congolese independence, the United States immediately sent a large number of officials and reporters to the Congo for "friendly" visits; at the same time, the United States colluded with Belgium to draft a plan for the so-called "development of the Congolese economy," granting Belgium a short-term loan of 20 million US dollars in an attempt to further control the Congolese economy. Currently, the United States is negotiating with the Belgian government for another long-term loan of 40 million US dollars. The reason why US imperialism is so vocal in "supporting" Congolese independence is simply to put a layer of hypocritical powder on its wolfish face in order to win the favor of the Congolese people, thereby achieving the sinister goal of replacing the Belgian colonialists and establishing a new colonial rule in the Congo. This cannot but arouse the serious vigilance of the Congolese people.
    However, neither Belgian old-line colonialism nor US neo-colonialism can stop the Congolese people from moving towards genuine independence. The Belgian colonialists' conspiracy to prevent the Congolese people from achieving genuine independence is increasingly opposed by people from all walks of life in the Congo. Now, from Stanleyville to Elisabethville, from Francqui Port to Tshikapa, the cry of "Colonialists get out of the Congo" is resounding everywhere. A mass movement against Belgian colonial rule is unfolding widely throughout the Congo.
    The large-scale strike movement launched by African workers in the Elisabethville area is continuing to expand. Workers on the 1,500-mile-long Lower Congo-Katanga Railway are also brewing a major strike. The Congolese nationalist parties, despite representing the interests of different classes and tribes, are forming a broad united front on the basis of opposing Belgian colonial rule. They have not only jointly boycotted the economic round table conference planned by the Belgian colonialists, but have also issued statements demanding that Belgium immediately withdraw its troops, abolish its military bases in the Congo, and immediately establish an interim government managed by Congolese people. All this shows that the era in which the Congo was arbitrarily manipulated by the colonialists is gone forever. The Congolese people are determined to struggle unyieldingly to achieve genuine national independence and freedom.

    刚果人民的胜利
    周明
    一向被帝国主义称作“安定的绿洲”的刚果，即将摆脱比利时帝国主义七十五年的殖民统治，在今年6月30日宣布独立。这是刚果人民长期以来所进行的争取民族独立斗争的重大胜利。
    刚果人民行将取得独立地位的这一胜利，是刚果人民长期以来进行反复曲折的英勇斗争的结果。从殖民主义者侵入刚果的第一天开始，刚果人民就掀起了反对殖民主义者的英勇斗争。尽管比利时殖民者对刚果人民进行了史无前例的野蛮屠杀，使刚果人口从1900年的二千万锐减到目前的一千二百万左右。但是刚果人民并没有被吓倒，反对比利时殖民统治的罢工、示威、起义等等，始终此起彼伏，连绵不断。
    1955年万隆会议以后，特别是1958年第一届全非人民大会以后，刚果人民反对比利时殖民统治的斗争，进入了一个新的阶段。1959年1月，利奥波德维尔的非洲人首先揭开了斗争的序幕。在短短的几个月内，斗争迅速蔓延全国，形成了声势浩大、规模空前的群众性运动。刚果的工人阶级，一向站在斗争的最前列，团结着全体刚果人民，同殖民主义者进行连续不断的斗争。仅在去年1月至7月，刚果各地爆发的万人以上的群众性示威、游行、罢工、抗议集会等，就达三十余起。刚果人民拿起石头、弓箭和长矛反抗殖民者的武装镇压，表现了坚强不屈的英雄气概。
    面对着刚果人民要求民族独立的势不可当的潮流，比利时殖民者眼看武装镇压已经无济于事，于是在去年10月16日提出了所谓刚果在四年内“分阶段独立”的计划，企图麻痹刚果人民的斗志，扼杀刚果的民族解放运动。然而，在觉醒了的刚果人民面前，这一阴谋计划没有得逞。去年12月，根据这一计划而举行的刚果地方“选举”，在刚果人民的坚决抵制下，遭到了可耻的失败。经过刚果人民的英勇斗争，终于迫使比利时殖民者，在今年1月召开的比利时—刚果圆桌会议上，同意刚果在今年6月30日实现独立。
    十分明显，这里丝毫也不存在比利时殖民者忽然大发慈悲，自愿退出刚果殖民地的问题。比利时殖民者慑于刚果人民反殖民主义斗争越来越高涨的巨大威力，而不得不作某些暂时的让步，以便伺机施展新的阴谋。
    现在，许多事实都说明，比利时殖民者绝不甘心于自己的失败，它企图以变相的形式，继续维护其在刚果的殖民统治。据西方报刊透露，比利时殖民者企图在政治上继续搬出比利时的国王，来充当独立的刚果的元首，企图把所谓“比—刚共同体”强加在刚果人民身上。最近，比利时殖民者策划了关于讨论刚果经济、社会和财政前途问题的圆桌会议。会议通过了将向未来的刚果政府提交的十八项决议。这些决议规定刚果仍同欧洲“共同市场”保持关系，刚果目前的“兑换管理制度”维持原状不变，比利时和刚果在公共事务和私人事务方面进行所谓“合作”……。一句话，刚果的财政经济仍须由比利时控制。在军事上，比利时殖民者力图继续保持在刚果的军事基地。比利时国防大臣纪耳松公然表示，比利时政府不会放弃在刚果的军事基地。比利时政府不仅拒不交出刚果军队的控制权，而且最近还从比利时本土向刚果源源增派军队。目前比利时在刚果有三个伞兵营，总共有二千四百人。还约有两万名殖民军队和大批的殖民警察。
    此外，比利时殖民者正在进行的一个卑劣阴谋是，分化刚果民族独立运动内部的团结，挑拨部族纠纷，甚至制造刚果人之间的流血冲突事件。比利时殖民者企图把富庶的加丹加省从刚果分裂出去，以便继续掠夺该省丰富的矿产资源。3月上旬，比利时殖民当局利用该省代表比利时垄断财团利益的科纳卡党，制造了一次造成数百人伤亡的刚果人之间的大规模流血冲突。最近一个多月来，在殖民主义者的挑唆下，发生流血冲突事件达十五起以上。比利时殖民者企图用制造刚果人自相残杀的惨剧的恶毒手法，以阻挠刚果人民实现真正的独立。
    特别值得指出的是，在比利时殖民者策划假独立阴谋的同时，美帝国主义在刚果也扮演了阴险的角色。它一方面假惺惺地表示“同情”和“支持”刚果“独立”；另一方面却支持比利时殖民者对刚果人民实行镇压和欺骗。美国在非洲的军事基地，曾经被用来运送比利时殖民军队，以屠杀刚果人民。美国的宣传机器把比利时殖民者说成是“开明的殖民者”，而却要刚果人民表现“忍耐和理智”。当刚果人民迫使比利时殖民者同意刚果独立之后，美国立即派遣大批官员和记者赴刚果进行“友好”访问；同时，美国勾结比利时草拟了所谓“开发刚果经济”的计划，给予比利时二千万美元的短期贷款，企图进一步控制刚果经济。目前，美国正在和比利时政府谈判另一笔四千万美元的长期贷款。美帝国主义所以口口声声地“支持”刚果独立，只不过是想给自己的豺狼嘴脸，涂上一层伪善的脂粉，以骗取刚果人民的好感，从而实现取代比利时殖民者的地位，在刚果建立新的殖民统治的罪恶目的。这不能不引起刚果人民的严重警惕。
    但是，不管比利时老牌殖民主义也好，美国新殖民主义也好，都不能阻挡刚果人民走向真正独立的道路。比利时殖民者阻挠刚果人民实现真正独立的阴谋，越来越遭到刚果各阶层人民的反对。现在，从斯坦利维尔到伊利沙伯维尔，从弗朗吉港到特希卡帕地区，到处响彻“殖民主义者滚出刚果”的呼声。一个反对比利时殖民统治的群众运动，正在刚果各地广泛展开。
    由伊利沙伯维尔地区非洲工人掀起的大规模罢工运动，正在继续扩大中。在长达一千五百英里的下刚果—加丹加铁路上工作的工人，也正在酝酿着大罢工。刚果的民族主义政党，尽管代表着不同阶层和部族的利益，但在反对比利时殖民统治的基础上正在结成广泛的统一战线。他们不仅对比利时殖民者策划的经济圆桌会议进行了共同抵制，并且纷纷发表声明，要求比利时立即撤退军队，取消在刚果的军事基地，立即成立由刚果人管理的临时政府。这些都说明，刚果由殖民主义者任意摆布的时代已经一去不复返了。刚果人民决心不屈不挠地进行斗争，以实现真正的民族独立和自由。
