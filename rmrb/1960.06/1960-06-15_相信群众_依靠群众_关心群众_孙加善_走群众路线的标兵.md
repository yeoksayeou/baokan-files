Believe in the Masses, Rely on the Masses, Care for the Masses
Sun Jiashan: A Model for Following the Mass Line

(Our report) Jinan — Sun Jiashan, the Party Secretary of the Duozhuang People's Commune in Zhangqiu County, Shandong Province, is always considerate of the masses, always believes in the masses, relies on the masses, and cares for the masses.

From his long revolutionary struggle, Sun Jiashan deeply understood that to accomplish a task, one must resolutely rely on the people under the leadership of the Party. He often said, "The power of the masses is the greatest, and they have the most ideas. No matter what, we can only do it well by relying on the masses." Guided by this thought, he always patiently listened to the opinions of the masses and, based on their correct opinions, made decisions that conformed to objective reality. When mountain management began in early spring last year, the commune Party committee decided to use the Changfang Brigade's management of Tongding Mountain as a pilot project. When Sun Jiashan went deep into the brigade to mobilize the masses, brigade cadre Zhao Zhongxiao suggested to him: Tongding Mountain is steep and has little land. Managing this mountain would be labor-intensive and slow to yield results. It would be better to manage Jiazishan first, which can protect the more than 300 mu of land at the foot of the mountain from being washed away by water and sand, ensuring high yields. He felt that this opinion was very correct, so he submitted it to the commune Party committee for research, and as a result, the original decision was revised. Because the decision conformed to the actual situation, the mountain management task was quickly completed. For example, in the early autumn of 1959, there was a severe drought. In order to ensure high yields on all the land on and off the mountain, it was necessary to solve the water source problem. But where did the water come from? Sun Jiashan invited five experienced old farmers from the Nanyu Production Team of the Changfang Brigade to discuss this issue. At that time, Zhao Taizhen's father suggested: "The higher the mountain, the higher the water. There are springs on the mountain, springs on the hillside, and even more springs at the foot of the mountain. In the past, water from mountain springs was used to irrigate the land under Jiuguan Mountain. As long as we are willing to dig, there will be water." Sun Jiashan thought this opinion was very reasonable, and immediately led Zhao Yanyi, the branch secretary of the Changfang Brigade, and team cadre Zhao Tinghua to conduct on-site research and experiments. As a result, three springs were intercepted in one afternoon. When the commune members saw the water, their enthusiasm was very high, and they quickly dug out 20 mountain springs, intercepted more than 10 places, and diverted water to irrigate more than 700 mu of land. After making a model, Sun Jiashan held a meeting of cadres above the level of small team leader in the entire commune in this team and promoted their experience, and the entire commune quickly launched a vigorous movement to dig water sources.

Sun Jiashan also deeply realized in his work that to rely on the masses, it is necessary to adhere to the Party's class line. Once, in order to divert water from the Tianping Canal to irrigate the land, a bridge had to be built at the Wai Kou of Dongyu, but some people did not understand and said it was wishful thinking. Sun Jiashan first found the team cadres Hu Yousheng, Zhao Zhongxiao, and transferred soldier Li Zhixin, and discussed with them. The cadres were even more motivated, and on the same day, five teams organized 120 laborers to start building the bridge. In just five days and nights, the bridge was built and irrigation began.

Sun Jiashan knows more than 300 cadres above the level of small team leader in the entire commune, and he knows the temperaments and characteristics of most of them. Li Shengshui, the deputy director of the sideline business of the Duozhuang Production Brigade, was not very active because of some difficulties in his work. Sun Jiashan knew that he was a transferred soldier, so he patiently educated him on the Party's fine revolutionary traditions, which enabled him to overcome his fear of difficulties and become active in his work again. Sun Jiashan also adopted the method of visiting families, visiting fields, and visiting commune-run factories to listen to opinions from all sides. He often kept track of the more than 1,100 households in the Duozhuang, Shixia, and Beiduozhuang production teams. In 1959, he visited every household, even the very remote Xiaoheyu, which was more than 20 li away from the commune's location, and he often went there to help them plan their production.

Sun Jiashan cares for the masses in every way. He often says to the cadres, "To rely on the masses, we must care for the masses. If we don't care for the masses, we can't talk about relying on the masses at all." He is always concerned about the masses' eating, clothing, and health problems. Every time he goes to a place, he always goes to the canteen or the nursery and kindergarten to take a look, and if he finds a problem, he solves it immediately. When Guo Enchang's son fell ill, Sun Jiashan learned about it at a meeting. As soon as the meeting ended, he ran to visit him and took out his own salary to help the patient with treatment.

Sun Jiashan always regards himself as a servant of the masses, and his eating, clothing, and living are the same as the masses. He has established a close relationship with the masses. Now the masses report to him as soon as they have something to do, and they ask him to solve problems. When he is in the office, there are often masses coming and going, and wherever he goes, he can integrate with the local masses. Zhao Yinxiang, an old commune member in his sixties from the Guanying Production Team, ran 20 li to the commune to report the activities of illegal landlords to him. An old man from the Xi'an Production Team ran more than 10 li to find him and reported that a cadre had a phenomenon of coercion and command. Whenever the commune implements a task, he can immediately grasp a lot of "first-hand" information, so that the commune Party committee can well implement various work policies. (Attached picture)

    相信群众　依靠群众　关心群众
    孙加善——走群众路线的标兵
    本报讯　山东章丘县垛庄人民公社党委书记孙加善，处处做群众的贴心人，事事相信群众，依靠群众，关心群众。
    孙加善从长期的革命斗争中深刻体会到，要完成一项任务，必须在党的领导下，坚决地依靠人民群众。他常说：“群众的力量最大、办法最多，无论什么事情依靠群众才能办好。”在这种思想指导下，他遇事总是耐心倾听群众意见，并根据群众的正确意见，作出符合客观实际的决定。去年春初治山开始，公社党委决定以长方大队治童顶山作为试点。孙加善在深入该队发动群众时，大队干部赵忠孝向他提出：童顶山山陡地少，治这个山费工多、收效慢，不如先治架子山，能保住山下的三百多亩土地不受水冲沙压，保证丰产。他觉得这个意见很对，就提交公社党委研究，结果修改了原来的决定。由于决定符合实际情况，结果很快完成了这次治山任务。又如，1959年秋初发生大旱，为了保证山上山下的土地全部丰产，必须解决水源问题。但是，水从那里来呢？孙加善到长方大队南峪生产小队请了五位有生产经验的老农，座谈这个问题。当时赵太祯的父亲提出：“山有多高，水有多高，山上有泉，山腰有泉，山下更有泉，在九泉山下过去就利用山泉浇过地，只要肯挖就有水。”孙加善认为这个意见很有道理，马上带领长方大队支部书记赵彦义和队干部赵廷华等实地研究试验，结果一下午截流三处。社员看到有水，情绪十分高涨，很快挖出山泉二十个，截流十多处，引水浇地七百多亩。做出样子后，孙加善在这个队召开了全社小队长以上干部会议，推广了他们的经验，全社迅速掀起了大挖水源运动。
    孙加善在工作中还深深地体会到要依靠群众，必须坚持党的阶级路线。曾经为了引天平渠的水浇地，要在东峪外口修一条渡桥，但是有的人不通，说这是心高妄想。孙加善就先找到了队干部胡由生、赵忠孝，转业军人李志信等五人商量，干部的干劲更足了，当天五个队就组织起一百二十个劳力动手修桥，仅仅五昼夜的时间，就把渡桥修好，并开始了浇地。
    孙加善对全社三百多名小队长以上的干部，他不但都认识，而且知道他们大部分人的脾气和特点。垛庄生产大队副业股长李胜水因为工作上有些困难不大积极。孙加善了解他是个转业军人，就耐心地对他进行了党的革命优良传统的教育，使他克服了畏难情绪，工作又积极起来。孙加善还采取到家庭访问、到田间访问、到社办工厂访问的办法，倾听各方面的意见。他经常掌握的垛庄、石匣、北垛庄等生产队共一千一百多户，在1959年一年中他每一户都访问过，就连十分偏僻的、离公社驻地二十多里路的小黑峪，他还经常前去访问，并帮助他们打生产谱。
    孙加善处处关心群众，他经常对干部说：“要依靠群众，就要关心群众，如果不关心群众，就根本谈不到依靠群众。”他对群众的吃饭、穿衣、疾病等问题，都时刻牵挂在心里。他每到一地，总要到食堂或托儿所、幼儿园内看一看，发现问题，立即解决。社员郭恩长的儿子生了病，在一个会议上孙加善知道了，会议刚一结束，就跑去看望，并把自己的工资拿出来帮助病人治病。
    孙加善始终把自己看成是群众的勤务员，吃、穿、住都和群众一样。他和群众建立了亲密的感情。现在群众一有事情就向他汇报，一有问题就找他解决。他在办公室里的时候常有群众来往，他到那里就能和那里的群众打成一片。官营生产队六十多岁的老社员赵寅祥，曾奔跑二十里路到公社向他汇报了不法地主的活动情况。西安生产队一位老大爷跑了十多里路找到他反映了某干部有强迫命令的现象。每当公社贯彻一项工作后，他马上就能掌握到许多“第一手”的情况，使公社党委对各项工作政策，都能很好贯彻。（附图片）
