    The people of Taiwan are waging an unyielding struggle against the US imperialist occupation of Taiwan, striving to return to the embrace of the motherland. The anti-American flames are burning throughout Taiwan, and burning ever more fiercely.

    The people of Taiwan are members of the great family of the Chinese people, inheriting and carrying forward the glorious tradition of the Chinese people in resisting foreign invaders. As early as the mid-17th century, the people of Taiwan heroically resisted the Spanish invaders, and under the leadership of the national hero Zheng Chenggong, drove away the Dutch colonialists and recovered Taiwan. During the 51 years of Japanese imperialist occupation of Taiwan, the people of Taiwan, in order to oppose the Japanese invaders' occupation of Taiwan and to return Taiwan to the motherland, held more than 40 armed uprisings, sacrificing more than 500,000 lives, and launching a tenacious struggle one after another. After Japan surrendered, the people of Taiwan, under the call of the motherland, launched a struggle against US imperialism and its running dogs. In February 1947, in order to support the "Shen Chong Incident" in Beijing and protest against the atrocities of the US military, young students and intellectuals in Taiwan held a demonstration of 5,000 people in Taipei, surrounding the US consulate for the first time, igniting the Taiwanese people's anger against the bloody rule of the US and Chiang, and twenty days later, the world-famous "February 28th Uprising" against the dark rule of the US and Chiang broke out.

    Since June 27, 1950, when the American bandits sent the Seventh Fleet to invade and occupy Taiwan, the people of Taiwan have suffered the devastation and ravages of US imperialism, and have fallen into a painful life of poverty, hunger, and terror. Not only that, but the United States also uses insidious and vicious means to create the conspiracy of "two Chinas," attempting to occupy Taiwan forever. All these monstrous crimes of the US aggressors constantly inspire the Taiwanese people's deep hatred and strong resistance against the US aggressors. On May 24, 1957, Taiwan compatriots launched a patriotic anti-American demonstration that shocked the world. Thirty thousand people in Taipei demolished the American "Embassy" in Taipei, tore up the American flag, and wrote a glorious page in the history of anti-American patriotic struggle. In August 1958, when the people of the motherland resolutely fought back against US imperialist military provocations and threats of war in the Taiwan Strait, the people of Taiwan once again launched an anti-American wave. In various parts of Taiwan, anti-American movements such as cutting off telephone lines, distributing leaflets "Opposing the US Military Occupation," and protesting against US military atrocities occurred. Under the impact of the anti-American struggle of the people of Taiwan, the terrified US imperialism instructed the Chiang Kai-shek clique to conduct another large-scale arrest. On August 29 alone, more than 770 Taiwan compatriots were arrested. However, the anti-American patriotic struggle of the people of Taiwan continues to develop.

    Due to the US imperialists' military, political, economic, and cultural aggression against Taiwan, the people of Taiwan are also launching anti-American struggles in all aspects. Taiwanese workers always stand at the forefront of the anti-American struggle, especially in those factories and mines that are plundered and controlled by the US aggressors, where the anti-American struggle of the workers is even stronger. In February 1957, the "Taiwan Shipbuilding Corporation" was annexed by US monopoly capital and renamed "Douglas Taiwan Shipbuilding Corporation." In the three years since then, more than 1,000 Taiwanese workers in this factory have held three collective strikes, demanding that US imperialists get out of the Taiwan Shipbuilding Corporation. Recently, in the factories and mines occupied by US imperialists in Tainan, Taipei, Keelung, Kaohsiung, and other places, there have been continuous anti-American incidents of strikes and go-slows.

    Taiwanese farmers have also launched continuous struggles to oppose the US military's seizure of fertile land and civilian houses to build military bases. In the past two years, farmers in Tainan, Chiayi, Taichung, Keelung, and other places have held protest demonstrations against US imperialism's seizure of civilian land. The vast number of farmers are also carrying out protests against the US dumping of surplus agricultural products and undermining Taiwan's rural economy.

    Taiwanese business and industrial circles have also launched a struggle against American economic plunder. US monopoly capital, such as American Feichou Pharmaceutical Factory, Fuller Milk Company, and Stevenson Shipping Company, have established factories in Taiwan, which have been strongly opposed by Taiwanese business and industrial circles. In January of this year, Taiwanese business and industrial circles also launched a "Love Local Products" movement, calling on the people of Taiwan to unite and boycott American goods. Patriotic people in Taiwan's business and industrial circles hate the so-called "aid" of US imperialism and satirize "US aid" as actually "aiding the US."

    The people of Taiwan, especially those in cultural and educational circles and young students, strongly oppose the cultural aggression of US imperialism, and have published articles in newspapers, opposing the American "slave education and yellow culture," and demanding the prohibition of the import of obscene and decadent American films and books.

    American soldiers run rampant in Taiwan, doing all kinds of evil, which has aroused the unparalleled anger of the people of all walks of life in Taiwan. In the past ten years, incidents of residents in cities and towns in Taiwan beating up American soldiers have continued to occur. Recently, in Kaohsiung and Pingtung, hundreds of citizens have surrounded and beaten American soldiers who insulted women and committed evil deeds. The citizens of Keelung City were angered by the inhuman atrocities of three American soldiers raping a thirteen-year-old girl, Huang Baozhu, and posted anti-American slogans such as "Avenge Huang Baozhu" and "Drive away the American beasts" on the streets. On the streets of Taiwan, citizens often throw stones at US military vehicles, and even children spit on American devils when they see them.

    Within the Chiang Kai-shek army, anti-American incidents also continue to occur. Near the Chiang army barracks, slogans and leaflets such as "Down with the unreasonable Americans" appear from time to time, and some are even posted on the walls of the residences of American "advisors." Dozens of students at the Anping Naval Academy once brewed a riot, preparing to shoot American "advisors." Even some "legislators" and "provincial assemblymen" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique have expressed dissatisfaction with the crimes of the American aggressors.

    All of the above fully demonstrates the hatred of compatriots from all walks of life in Taiwan towards the US aggressors. Even Western news agency reporters have to admit: "Most people in Taiwan are extremely anti-American." "It is expected that a larger-scale anti-American riot than 'May 24' will occur again." The people of Taiwan have tempered themselves in the struggle against US imperialism and are constantly strengthening their anti-American fighting spirit.

    The rising anti-American sentiment of Taiwan compatriots is inseparable from their love for the motherland and their thoughts and feelings for the motherland. In the past ten years, the more painful Taiwan compatriots are under the oppression of US imperialism, the more they miss their mother—the motherland. The people of Taiwan have always been very clear: away from the motherland, the future of Taiwan can only be a colony; without the motherland, the fate of the people of Taiwan is slavery. In recent years, every victory of the motherland has encouraged Taiwan compatriots to bravely rise up to fight the enemy, and to smash the shameless lies and conspiracies such as "Taiwan autonomy," "Taiwan independence," and "Taiwanese Taiwan" fabricated by US aggressors and their lackeys.

    The anti-American patriotic struggle of Taiwan compatriots is not isolated, it is an integral part of the anti-American struggle of the entire Chinese people. The people of the motherland on the mainland are deeply concerned about the painful life of Taiwan compatriots suffering from the devastation and plunder of US aggressors, and fully support and support the anti-American patriotic struggle of the people of Taiwan. In September 1958, more than 300 million people in urban and rural areas across China held powerful demonstrations against US aggressors, supporting the anti-American struggle of the people of Taiwan. The people of the whole country are building socialism at the speed of continuing leaps forward, strengthening national defense, and carrying out the sacred struggle to liberate Taiwan. The strong development of the motherland is the decisive guarantee for the liberation of Taiwan compatriots. US imperialism is being besieged by the people of Asia and the world, and its life will not be long. Under the encouragement of the anti-American wave of the people of the world, and with the support of the people of the whole country, the struggle of Taiwan compatriots against US imperialist occupation of Taiwan and striving to return to the embrace of the motherland will surely have a greater upsurge, and will surely be able to achieve final victory. The great Chinese people must liberate their sacred territory of Taiwan, and will never give up until they achieve their goal!

    台湾同胞的反美斗争日益高涨
    台湾民主自治同盟秘书长  徐萌山
    台湾人民为争取回到祖国怀抱，不屈不挠地进行着反对美帝国主义侵占台湾的斗争。反美怒火在台湾全岛燃烧着，而且越烧越炽烈。
    台湾人民是中国人民大家庭的一个成员，继承和发扬着中国人民反抗外国侵略者的光荣传统。早在十七世纪中叶，台湾人民就曾经英勇地反抗了西班牙侵略者，并在民族英雄郑成功的领导下，赶走了荷兰殖民者，收复了台湾。在日本帝国主义侵占台湾的五十一年中，台湾人民为了反对日本侵略者侵占台湾，使台湾归还祖国，举行过四十多次武装起义，牺牲了五十多万人的生命，前仆后继地展开了顽强的斗争。日本投降后，台湾人民在祖国的号召下，展开了反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争。1947年2月，台湾青年学生和知识界为了声援北京“沈崇事件”，抗议美军暴行，在台北举行了五千人的示威大游行，第一次包围了美国领事馆，点燃了台湾人民对美蒋血腥统治的怒火，二十天后爆发了全世界有名的反对美蒋黑暗统治的“二·二八起义”。
    自从1950年6月27日美国强盗派遣第七舰队武装侵占台湾以来，台湾人民受尽了美帝国主义的宰割和蹂躏，陷入贫穷、饥饿、恐怖的痛苦生活中。不仅如此，美国还使用阴险、毒辣的手段，制造“两个中国”的阴谋，企图永远霸占台湾。美国侵略者的这一切滔天罪行，每时每刻都激发着台湾人民对美国侵略者的切齿痛恨和强烈的反抗。1957年5月24日，台湾同胞掀起了震动全世界的爱国反美大示威。台北市三万群众捣毁了台北的美国“大使馆”，撕毁了美国国旗，写下了反美爱国斗争史上光荣的一页。1958年8月，当祖国人民坚决反击美帝国主义在台湾海峡的军事挑衅和战争威胁的时候，台湾人民再一次地掀起了反美的浪潮。在台湾各地发生了割断电话线，散发“反对美军侵占”的传单，以及抗议美军暴行的示威等反美运动。在台湾人民反美斗争浪潮的冲击下，胆战心惊的美帝国主义，指使蒋介石集团又一次进行大逮捕，仅仅在8月29日一天，就有七百七十多台湾同胞被捕。但是，台湾人民的反美爱国斗争，仍在继续发展着。
    由于美帝国主义对台湾实行军事、政治、经济、文化的侵略，台湾人民也在各方面展开反美斗争。台湾工人总是站在反美斗争的最前列，特别是在那些被美国侵略者掠夺和控制的工厂、矿山里，工人群众的反美斗争更加强烈。1957年2月“台湾造船公司”被美国垄断资本所并吞，改为“段格斯台湾造船公司”后，三年来这个厂的一千多名台湾工人，举行过三次集体大罢工，要求美帝国主义者从台湾造船公司滚出去。最近在台南、台北、基隆、高雄等地美帝国主义者霸占的厂矿中，都连续发生多起罢工、怠工的反美事件。
    台湾农民为反对美军强占良田、民房，建筑军事基地，也展开了连续不断的斗争。最近两年来，台南、嘉义、台中、基隆等地的农民，都举行过反对美帝国主义强占民田的抗议示威。广大的农民还为反对美国倾销剩余农产品、破坏台湾农村经济而进行着抗议活动。
    台湾工商界人士也对美国经济掠夺展开了斗争。美国飞筹药厂、福乐奶品公司、史蒂文森轮船公司等美国垄断资本在台湾设厂，都遭到台湾工商界的强烈反对。今年1月，台湾工商界还发起了一个“爱用本地货”运动，号召台湾人民团结起来抵制美国货。台湾工商界爱国人士痛恨美帝国主义的所谓“援助”，讽刺“美援”实际上是“援美”。
    台湾人民，特别是文化教育界人士和青年学生强烈反对美帝国主义的文化侵略，纷纷在报上发表文章，反对美国的“奴化教育和黄色文化”，要求禁止诲淫诲盗的美国影片和书刊的进口。
    美国兽兵在台湾横行霸道，为非作歹，更激起了台湾各阶层人民的无比愤怒。十年来台湾各地城乡居民痛打美军的事件，不断发生。最近在高雄、屏东都发生过几百个市民围打污辱妇女、为非作恶的美国兵的事件。基隆市市民为三个美国兵轮奸一个十三岁女童黄宝珠的灭绝人性的暴行所激怒，在街上张贴了“为黄宝珠报仇”、“赶走美国野兽”等反美标语。在台湾街道上，市民经常向美军汽车投掷石块，连小孩子见了美国佬，也向他们吐唾沫。
    在蒋介石军队内部，反美事件也不断发生。在蒋军兵营附近，不时出现“打倒蛮不讲理的美国佬”等标语和传单，有些还贴到美军“顾问”住宅的墙壁上。安平的海军士官学校的几十个学员曾经酝酿过暴动，准备枪杀美国“顾问”。连蒋介石集团的一部分“立法委员”和“省议员”，对于美国侵略者的罪行也表示不满。
    上述这一切，都充分说明了台湾各阶层同胞对美国侵略者的仇恨。甚至连西方通讯社记者也不得不承认：“台湾一般人都极为反美”。“再发生比‘五·二四’还要大规模的反美暴动，也是意料中的事。”台湾同胞在对美帝国主义斗争中锻炼了自己，不断地增强着反美的斗志。
    台湾同胞反美情绪的高涨，是和他们热爱祖国、向往祖国的思想和感情分不开的。十年来，台湾同胞在美帝国主义压榨下，越是痛苦就越怀念母亲——祖国。台湾人民从来就很清楚：离开了祖国，台湾的前途只能是殖民地；没有祖国，台湾人民的命运就是奴隶。几年来，祖国的每一个胜利，都鼓舞着台湾同胞勇敢地起来向敌人作斗争，粉碎美国侵略者及其奴才所制造的“台湾自治”、“台湾独立”、“台湾人的台湾”等等无耻谰言和阴谋。
    台湾同胞的反美爱国斗争不是孤立的，它是全中国人民反美斗争的组成部分。祖国大陆人民亲切地关怀台湾同胞备受美国侵略者摧残和掠夺的痛苦生活，全力声援和支持台湾人民的反美爱国斗争。1958年9月，全中国城乡人民有三亿多人举行了反对美国侵略者的强大示威，支持了台湾人民的反美斗争。全国人民正在以继续跃进的速度建设社会主义，加强国防力量，进行解放台湾的神圣斗争。祖国的强大发展，就是台湾同胞获得解放的决定性的保证。美帝国主义正处在亚洲和全世界人民的围攻中，它的寿命不会很长了。在全世界人民反美浪潮的鼓舞下，在全国人民的支援下，台湾同胞反对美帝国主义侵占台湾、争取回到祖国怀抱的斗争必将有更大的兴起，而且一定能够取得最后胜利。伟大的中国人民一定要解放自己的神圣领土台湾，不达到目的决不罢休！
