	Dear Comrade Tsedenbal, dear comrades and friends:

	Our friendly visit to the Mongolian People's Republic has come to a successful conclusion, and we are now about to set off on our journey home. At this moment of departure, I would like to express, on behalf of Comrade Chen Yi and all the visiting comrades, and in my own name, our gratitude to the Mongolian government, the Mongolian people, and Chairman Tsedenbal for their gracious hospitality and warm welcome.

	We came to Mongolia this time with the fraternal friendship of the Chinese people, and we will now return to China laden with the profound friendship of the Mongolian people. We are very happy about this visit and the results achieved.

	Through our visits and observations over the past few days, we have witnessed firsthand the tremendous achievements you have made in animal husbandry, agriculture, industry, and cultural undertakings, and we have seen firsthand the high degree of enthusiasm shown by the hardworking and courageous Mongolian people in creating their own happy lives. Your country is advancing rapidly along the socialist path. We believe that under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the Mongolian government, headed by Comrade Tsedenbal, the Mongolian people will certainly be able to build their country into a prosperous and strong nation.

	During this visit, we have seen the further consolidation and development of the fraternal friendship between China and Mongolia, which is something that deserves the jubilation and encouragement of our two peoples. We held talks with Mongolian leaders during this visit. Our two countries signed the historically significant Sino-Mongolian Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance. This will have a significant effect on promoting the fraternal and friendly relations between our two countries. Our two countries, China and Mongolia, will always cooperate closely and advance hand in hand in the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union!

	I wish the fraternal Mongolian people new and greater achievements in the cause of building socialism!

	May the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian peoples last forever!

	Bayartai (Goodbye).

    我们这次带着中国人民的兄弟友情来到蒙古，现在又将满载着蒙古人民的深厚友情回到中国。我们对于这一次的访问和所取得的成果感到十分高兴。
    通过几天来的参观访问，我们亲眼看到了你们在畜牧业、农业、工业和文化事业方面所获得的巨大成就，亲眼看到了勤劳勇敢的蒙古人民为创造自己的美好生活所表现的高度热情。你们的国家正在沿着社会主义的大道迅速地前进。我们相信，蒙古人民在以泽登巴尔同志为首的蒙古人民革命党和蒙古政府的领导下，一定能够把自己的国家建设得繁荣和昌盛。
    在这次访问过程中，我们看到中蒙两国的兄弟友谊有了进一步的巩固和发展，这是值得我们两国人民欢欣鼓舞的。我们这次同蒙古领导同志举行了会谈。我们两国签订了具有历史意义的中蒙友好互助条约。这对于促进我们两国的兄弟友好关系都将产生重大的作用。我们中蒙两国在以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭中将永远亲密合作，携手并进！
    祝兄弟的蒙古人民在建设社会主义的事业中获得新的更大的成就！
    祝中蒙两国人民的兄弟友谊万古长青！
    巴亚尔台（再见）。
