The Japanese Socialist Party Issues Statement Saying Kishi Nobusuke's Only Way Out is to Resign

The Japanese Socialist Party's statement said: "We solemnly swear to the people of the whole country that, in order to defend democracy, dissolve the Diet, and prevent the ratification of the new Security Treaty, the entire party will persist in fighting to the end."

The statement said: The June 4th general strike carried out by workers who stood up to prevent the ratification of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and demanded the resignation of Kishi Nobusuke and the dissolution of the Diet was consistently orderly and without any confusion.

The statement said: Kishi Nobusuke should now humbly listen to the public opinion expressed by this unified action. Kishi Nobusuke's only way out is to resign immediately. If the Prime Minister continues to defy public opinion and cling to power, the people's resentment will reach its peak, and unpredictable consequences will inevitably result. This responsibility should be borne by the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet.

    日本社会党发表声明说
    岸信介唯一出路就是下台
    日本社会党的声明说：“我们严肃地向全国人民宣誓，为维护民主、解散国会、阻止批准新安全条约的胜利，要全党坚持奋斗到底。”
    声明说：挺身起来阻止批准新日美“安全条约”、要求岸信介下台和解散国会的工人所进行的六·四总罢工，始终是秩序井然，一丝不乱地在进行。
    声明说：岸信介现在应该虚心倾听这个统一行动所表示的人民舆论。岸信介唯一的出路就是立即下台。如果首相依然违背舆论，霸占政权，那么人民的忿懑将达到极点，必然会造成不可预测的后果。这个责任应由岸信介内阁承担。
