    Inherit Comrade Lin Boqu's Revolutionary Fighting Spirit
    On October 1, 1949, when Chairman Mao announced the founding of the People's Republic of China at Tiananmen Square, Comrade Lin Boqu was on the rostrum.
    In 1905, Comrade Lin Boqu joined the Tongmenghui (Chinese Revolutionary Alliance) in Tokyo. After returning to China, he established the Zhenchu Academy in Changsha to conduct secret propaganda work for the Tongmenghui. Later, he went to Jilin in Northeast China to engage in revolutionary work in the frontier regions. He was recalled to Hunan only after the failure of the Huanghuagang Uprising. This is a photo of him during his work in Jilin.
    From 1937 to 1948, Comrade Lin Boqu served as the Chairman of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government. This is a photo of Comrade Lin Boqu working in a cave dwelling of the Border Region Government in Yan'an in 1945.
    In 1927, Comrade Lin Boqu participated in the famous Nanchang Uprising. This is a group photo of Comrade Lin Boqu (fourth from the right in the back row) in Nanchang in the spring of 1927 with Comrades Li Fuchun (first from the right in the front row), Guo Moruo (third from the right in the front row), and Li Yimang (fifth from the right in the back row).
    During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Party frequently sent Comrade Lin Boqu to Chongqing to persuade the Kuomintang authorities to resist Japan through reasoning and struggle. This is a photo of him at the Chongqing Coral Dam Airport in 1940.
    In 1958, Comrade Lin Boqu cordially talked with workers at the Yinchuan Power Plant during an inspection tour of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
