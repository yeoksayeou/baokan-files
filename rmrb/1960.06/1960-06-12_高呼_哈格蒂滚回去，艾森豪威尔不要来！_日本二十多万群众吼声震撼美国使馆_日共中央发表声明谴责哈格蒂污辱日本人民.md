Xinhua News Agency, June 11th, Tokyo dispatch: Demonstrations were held by the Japanese public in front of the US Embassy in Tokyo throughout the whole day today. More than 200,000 people demonstrated near the embassy. Sources say the US embassy received unprecedented shaking.

Despite the presence of 1,500 helmeted police officers surrounding the embassy, the demonstrators were not intimidated by the large number of police officers, and angrily surged towards the embassy entrance. The morale of the masses overwhelmed the pressure exerted on them by the large number of police officers. They shouted: "Hagerty get out," "Eisenhower, don't come."

The demonstration in front of the embassy continued until 9 p.m.

Sources say that the Japanese people's anger against US imperialism is rapidly rising with the progress of the demonstrations, because the US imperialists want to impose a notorious military alliance treaty on Japan, making Japan its loyal appendage.

The report said: Demonstrators held up many signs written in English: "We don't like Ike - warmonger!" "Hagerty get out and take the U-2 plane with you!"

Xinhua News Agency, June 11th, Tokyo dispatch: The Presidium of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement today pointing out that the large-scale demonstration on the 10th by more than 20,000 angry people surrounding US Presidential Press Secretary Hagerty at Haneda Airport in Tokyo is a patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people to protest Hagerty's visit to Japan and to oppose the US President's activities in Japan. It reflects the patriotic and just demands of the Japanese people who yearn for independence and peace.

The statement strongly condemned the Kishi Nobusuke group for instructing Liberal Democratic Party members and fascists to commit violence against representatives of the demonstrating masses, and for bowing its head to the US government to "apologize," claiming to punish the demonstrating masses, and also mobilizing the bourgeois propaganda machine to attack the people by reversing right and wrong.

The statement solemnly condemned Hagerty's rogue attitude of scolding the Japanese people, trampling on the will of the Japanese people, and threatening to forcibly implement the US President's visit to Japan plan.

The statement said that the attitude of the Kishi Nobusuke government and Hagerty has further aroused the anger and protests of the Japanese people.

The statement exposed the purpose of Eisenhower's visit to Japan, saying that he was to promote Japan's ratification of the new "security treaty" that would further drag Japan into an aggressive US-Japan military alliance and to prop up the tottering Kishi Nobusuke cabinet.

The statement also called on the Japanese people to strive for the victory of the June 11th, June 15th, and June 19th large-scale demonstrations and to complete the signature campaign.

    日本二十多万群众吼声震撼美国使馆
    日共中央发表声明谴责哈格蒂污辱日本人民
    新华社11日讯　东京消息：今天一整天，日本公众在美国驻东京大使馆前面举行示威。到大使馆附近去示威的群众有二十万人以上，消息说，美国大使馆受到史无前例的震动。
    尽管大使馆周围有一千五百名戴钢盔的警察。但是示威者没有被大批警察吓倒，愤怒地涌向大使馆门口，群众的志气压倒了大批警察对他们所施加的压力。他们高呼：“哈格蒂滚回去”，“艾森豪威尔，不要来”。
    在大使馆面前的示威一直继续到晚九点钟。
    消息说，日本人民反对美帝国主义的愤怒情绪随着示威的进行而迅速高涨，因为美帝国主义者要把臭名远扬的军事同盟条约强加在日本身上，使日本成为它的忠实附庸。
    消息说：示威群众高举着许多用英文写的标语牌：“我们不喜欢艾克——战争贩子！”“哈格蒂滚回去，把U—2飞机带走！”
    新华社11日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会干部会今天发表声明指出，两万多名愤怒的群众10日在东京羽田机场前包围美国总统新闻秘书哈格蒂的大示威，是日本人民抗议哈格蒂前来日本和反对美国总统到日本活动的爱国正义斗争，反映了渴望独立与和平的日本人民的爱国正义要求。
    声明强烈谴责岸信介集团指使自由民主党党徒和法西斯分子对示威群众代表施加暴行，并低头向美国政府“道歉”，声称要处罚示威群众，还动员资产阶级宣传机器颠倒是非地攻击人民。
    声明严正谴责哈格蒂谩骂日本人民、蹂躏日本人民意志、扬言要强行实施美国总统访日计划的无赖态度。
    声明说，岸信介政府和哈格蒂的这种态度更加激起了日本人民的愤怒和抗议。
    声明揭露艾森豪威尔访问日本的目的说，他是为了促使日本批准把日本进一步拖进侵略性日美军事同盟的新“安全条约”，并且给摇摇欲坠的岸信介内阁撑腰。
    声明还号召日本人民为争取6月11日和6月15日以及6月19日大示威的胜利和完成签名运动而奋斗。
