This newspaper Nanchang, June 21st dispatch: In the activity of supporting agriculture, Jiangxi Province's commercial departments have carried forward the work method of grasping details and working solidly, and have established, level by level, from the county and commune to the production team, a storage and transportation network, a technical instruction network, and a farm tool repair network centered on the commercial supply network. At present, more than 80 counties in the province have initially formed a complete set of "four networks," and the supply, storage, transportation, technical instruction, and repair work of production materials have been twisted into a new situation, greatly accelerating the process of supporting agricultural technology transformation.

Supplying agricultural production materials to the people's communes as early as possible is the primary task of the commercial departments in supporting the technical transformation of agriculture. In order to achieve the goal of speed, the commercial departments in various parts of Jiangxi first extended the original supply network and storage and transportation network to the communes, production brigades, production teams, and canteens. According to incomplete statistics, in more than 1,000 rural people's communes in the province, more than 120,000 supply points (including sales agents) have been adjusted and newly built. Through these dense supply points, in February of this year, the province transported and sold more than 20 million yuan worth of production materials directly to the front line of production, achieving the goal of having them whenever they were needed and wherever they were needed.

Because this year's demand for agricultural production materials is large and the variety is diverse, Jiangxi's commercial departments used the commercial supply network to actively organize people's communes to run small factories for the production of production materials by holding demonstration factories and disseminating technology. Since the beginning of this year, the province's commercial departments have helped people's communes to build and expand more than 80,000 small factories and mines; in the first quarter, this batch of commune-run industries manufactured more than 10 million pieces of various agricultural machinery; in addition, they also produced 1.5 million tons of local fertilizer and 390,000 tons of local pesticides.

Jiangxi Province's commercial departments not only send materials to the front line of agricultural production, but also give full play to the effectiveness of these materials by imparting technology. On the one hand, commercial departments in various places vigorously carry out technical革新, vigorously carry out technical training, so that commercial employees are versatile employees who are both salespersons and technicians and repairers; on the other hand, they adopt methods such as centralized training, roving instruction, on-site demonstrations, and on-site observation to help people's communes train technical personnel. At present, cadres of commercial departments throughout the province have helped communes train more than 150,000 technicians, with an average of two or three people per team. This huge mass technical force has played a significant role in ensuring the rapid promotion and normal use of more than 100,000 rice transplanters and a large number of agricultural machinery and irrigation and drainage machinery throughout the province. In addition, they also pay close attention to the repair and distribution of agricultural tools. At present, more than 20,000 agricultural tool repair factories (stations, groups) have been set up throughout the province. Since the beginning of this year, repair personnel from counties, communes, and teams, together with salespeople from commercial departments, have gone deep into communes and teams to repair more than 25 million pieces of agricultural tools and implements. When helping people's communes establish a farm tool repair network, the Pingxiang County Commercial Department adopted the method of "hen hatching eggs," first cooperating with local industrial departments to establish three machinery factories in the county, helping them quickly manufacture local lathes, local planers, and local drilling machines, as well as sawing machines and bamboo splitting machines; then, the commercial department transferred these equipment for sale to more than 20 people's communes throughout the county to equip commune farm tool repair factories. After the commune repair factories were established, they further manufactured simple equipment and tools to arm more than 600 brigade farm tool repair stations in the county; the brigade repair stations then helped the team establish farm tool maintenance groups. In this way, the county's farm tool repair reached the bottom, ensuring that small repairs were not made outside the team, medium repairs were not made outside the commune, and major repairs were not made outside the county.

    以供应生产资料为中心储运、修配、传授技术拧成一股绳
    江西商业支援农业“四网”成套
    全省办起十二万个供应点、八万多个农具修造厂，培训技术人员十五万名
    本报南昌21日电　江西省商业部门在支援农业活动中，发扬了抓得细、抓得扎实的工作方法，从县、公社到生产队，逐级建立了以商业供应网为中心的储运网、技术传授网和农具修配网。目前全省八十多个县已初步形成“四网”成套，生产资料的供应、储运、技术传授和修配工作拧成一股绳的新局面，大大加快了支援农业技术改造的进程。
    及早地把农业生产资料供应给人民公社，这是商业部门支援农业技术改造的首要任务。为了达到快的目的，江西各地商业部门首先将原有的供应网、储运网下伸到公社、生产大队以至生产小队和食堂。据不完全统计，在全省一千多个农村人民公社中，就调整和新建了十二万多个供应点（包括代销员）通过这些稠密的供应点，今年2月间全省曾把价值二千多万圆的生产资料一直运销到生产第一线，做到了随时要随时有，那里要那里有。
    由于今年农业生产资料需要量大、品种多，江西商业部门便通过商业供应网，采用举办示范工厂、传播技术等办法，积极组织人民公社大办生产生产资料的小型工厂。今年来，全省商业部门就帮助人民公社新建和扩建了八万多个小型厂矿；第一季度内，这批社办工业就制造出各式农业机具一千多万件；此外还生产了土化肥一百五十万吨，土农药三十九万吨。
    江西省商业部门不仅将物资送到农业生产第一线去，而且还通过传授技术，来充分发挥这些物资的效能。各地商业部门一方面大搞技术革新，大搞技术练兵，使商业职工既是营业员，又是技术员、修配员的多面手；一方面采取集中培训、巡回传授、现场表演和实地观摩等办法，帮助人民公社培训技术人员。目前全省商业部门干部已帮助公社培训了十五万余名技术人员，平均每个小队有二、三名。这支庞大的群众性的技术队伍，对保证全省十余万部插秧机和大批农业机具、排灌机械迅速推广，正常使用起了很大的作用。此外，他们还十分注意农具的修配工作。目前全省已办起农具修配厂（站、组）二万多个。今年以来，县、社、队的修配人员与商业部门的营业员一起，深入社队，修好了二千五百多万件农具和工具。萍乡县商业部门在协助人民公社建立农具修配网时，采取“母鸡孵蛋”的办法，先配合地方工业部门在全县建立了三个机械厂，帮助他们迅速制造土车床、土刨床和土钻床和锯木机、破篾机等设备；接着，商业部门便将这些设备转售给全县二十多个人民公社，装备公社农具修造厂。公社修造厂办起来以后，便进一步制造简易的设备和工具，把全县六百多个大队的农具修配站武装起来；大队修配站又帮助小队建立农具保养组。这样，就使全县农具修配一网到底，做到了小修不出队，中修不出社，大修不出县。
