Indonesia's Powerful Groups Suffer the Bitter Fruit of Their Actions
    The Anti-China Results are Like Lifting a Rock Only to Drop it on One's Own Feet
    It has deepened Indonesia's own economic difficulties, stagnated urban-rural exchange, severely damaged the rural acquisition and distribution system, and made people's lives more difficult. Facts have proven that the Overseas Chinese economy plays a positive role in Indonesia.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 15th: According to reports in Indonesian newspapers and news agencies, due to the Indonesian powerful groups' rejection of the Overseas Chinese economy, a positive factor in Indonesia's economic life, Indonesia's own economic difficulties have deepened. First, urban-rural exchange has stagnated, the rural acquisition and distribution system has been severely damaged, and people's lives have become more difficult.
    According to a report by Antara News Agency on May 7th, Indonesian Minister of Information Maladi admitted that after the ban on Overseas Chinese small traders operating in rural areas, no one was managing the acquisition of native products in Indonesian rural areas. He said that this situation "cannot be allowed to drag on for too long, because the people in the townships urgently need to sell their products and use the proceeds to maintain their agriculture and family expenses."
    The news agency reported on May 8th that the market situation in Juluk, the largest coffee market in the areas of Leran County and Bagkeram, was poor, so that farmers had no interest in growing coffee. "People's Ideology News" also reported that the Juluk market was generally extremely tired and silent, which was the result of the blow from the implementation of Presidential Decree No. 10. Due to the lack of buyers, the market price of coffee fell from 30 rupiahs per kilogram to 10 rupiahs, causing great losses to farmers.
    Earlier, Antara News Agency reporters reported from Kalimantan that because Overseas Chinese were forced to leave the inland areas of Kalimantan and return to China, the work of acquiring forest products from the residents of Kalimantan was stagnated and hindered. On the one hand, cities cannot get supplies of rattan, rubber, and many other forest products. On the other hand, in the forest areas of the Ta Kapuas River basin, Kahayan, and Berito, large quantities of forest products are piled up. For example, a large number of mature oilseeds in Uho Gan and Samarinda can only rot on the ground because no one buys them. This situation shows that the Overseas Chinese economy plays a positive role in urban-rural exchange in Indonesia. After the Indonesian powerful groups rejected the Overseas Chinese economy, it caused great difficulties to the lives of the Indonesian people. Kalimantan is one example. Even Antara News Agency said that the departure of many Overseas Chinese from Kalimantan to return to China would greatly affect the economic development of the region.
    The news agency also reported that at a plenary session of the East Java Regional Autonomous Region Council not long ago, the council's economic group put forward a proposal pointing out that the acquisition of native products in East Java was difficult due to the forced departure of Overseas Chinese small traders. The proposal also said that this meant that the mass economy was facing stagnation, which would lead to economic recession.
    This situation has also occurred in many other parts of Indonesia. Rum Pranbi, secretary of the National Council of the All-Indonesia Central Trade Union, said in a statement not long ago that after the ban on the commercial activities of Overseas Chinese in rural areas, Indonesian cooperatives and retailers could not replace them. As a result, the supply of people's daily necessities was stagnated, the prices of daily necessities soared, and the purchasing power of rural people dropped a lot.
    Indonesian News Agency reported on April 12th that the Deputy Speaker of the West Java Regional Council, Rahman Sainal, requested the relevant authorities to provide more freedom of activity and places for Overseas Chinese businessmen remaining in Indonesia in accordance with current regulations. He said that Overseas Chinese businessmen who have funds and are able to conduct trade actually have no opportunity to carry out such activities.
    The active planner of the ban on Overseas Chinese small traders, former Minister of Commerce and current manager of the Indonesian National Bank, Murjomi Seno, also had to admit at a press conference held in Tretes near Surabaya on April 8th that "due to the implementation of Presidential Decree No. 10, it seems that progress in the economic field is not smooth." However, he said that he would insist on continuing to do so.

    印度尼西亚有势力集团自食恶果
    反华结果是搬起石头砸了脚
    加深了印度尼西亚本身的经济困难，使城乡交流停滞，农村收购分配系统受到严重破坏，人民生活更加艰难。事实证明华侨经济在印度尼西亚起着积极作用。
    新华社15日讯　雅加达消息：据印度尼西亚报刊和通讯社报道，由于印度尼西亚有势力集团排斥华侨经济这个在印度尼西亚经济生活中的积极因素，结果加深了印度尼西亚本身的经济困难，首先是使城乡交流停滞，农村收购分配系统受到严重破坏，人民生活更加艰难。
    据安塔拉通讯社5月7日报道，印度尼西亚情报部长马拉迪承认了禁止华侨小商贩在乡村地区活动后，印度尼西亚乡村地区的土产收购工作无人经营的情况。他说，这种情况“不能任其过于长久地拖延下去，因为乡镇人民极需销售其产品并把所得现款维持他们农业和家庭的费用”。
    这家通讯社5月8日报道，来让县和百格业览一带的最大的咖啡市场朱鹿的市况不佳，以致农民对种植咖啡毫无兴趣。“人民思潮报”还报道，朱鹿市场一般都极度疲惫与沉寂，这是受到执行总统第十号法令的打击的结果。由于无人收购，咖啡的市价一公斤从三十盾下跌到十盾，使农民受到很大损失。
    早些时候，安塔拉通讯社记者自加里曼丹报道，由于华侨被迫离开加里曼丹内地回国，向加里曼丹居民收购林产品的工作即停滞受阻。一方面，城市不能得到藤、橡胶和其他许多林产品的供应，另一方面，在林产区太卡浦亚斯河流域，卡哈扬和贝里托等地又堆积着大量林产品，如在乌合甘和三马林达的大量成熟的油籽由于无人收购只好任其腐烂落地，这种情况说明，华侨经济在印度尼西亚城乡交流中起着积极作用，印度尼西亚有势力集团排斥了华侨经济以后，给印度尼西亚人民的生活造成很大困难，加里曼丹即是一例。甚至安塔拉通讯社也说，许多华侨的离开加里曼丹回国将大大影响这个地区的经济发展。
    这家通讯社还报道，在东爪哇一级自治区议会前不久举行的一次全体会议上，议会经济小组曾经提出一项提案指出，东爪哇地区的土产收购工作由于华侨小商贩被迫离开而出现困难。提案还说，这意味着群众经济面临停滞，它将造成经济衰退的后果。
    这种情况也在印度尼西亚其他许多地方发生。全印度尼西亚中央职工会全国理事会书记伦普兰比前不久发表的声明说，在禁止农村地区华侨的商业活动后，印度尼西亚的合作社和零售商代替不了他们，结果人民日用必需品的供应就陷于停滞状态，日用必须品的价格猛涨，农村人民的购买力下降很多。
    印度尼西亚新闻社4月12日报道西爪哇地方议会副议长拉赫曼·赛纳尔要求有关当局根据现行条例给留在印度尼西亚的华侨商人提供较多的活动自由和场所。他说，具有资金并能够进行贸易活动的华侨商人实际上没有机会进行这种活动。
    禁止华侨小商贩的积极策划者、前商业部长、现任印度尼西亚国家银行经理穆耳约米森诺4月8日在泗水附近特雷特斯举行的一次记者招待会上也不得不承认，“由于执行了第十号总统法令，看来在经济方面的进展是不顺利的。”可是他表示将坚持继续这么做。
