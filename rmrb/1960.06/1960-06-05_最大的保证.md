The greatest guarantee

Turning June into a month of significantly increased production is the aspiration of workers nationwide and a natural trend in the current excellent situation on the industrial and transportation front. How do we promote the rapid and universal realization of this great goal? The greatest guarantee lies in the Party organizations and leading cadres at all levels firmly grasping current production.

To grasp production, it is necessary to grasp it firmly, concretely, and meticulously. This requires leading cadres to go deep into the front line of production, participate in production, and lead production. This excellent style of work, consistently upheld by our Party, possesses immense power.

First, it can further strengthen the relationship between cadres and the masses, and inspire the revolutionary zeal and production enthusiasm of the masses. As many steelworkers say, "When the secretary and the factory director come to the furnace, we are filled with energy."

Second, it can timely and correctly identify and solve problems, clearing the way for a substantial increase in production.

Third, it can timely discover and summarize various advanced experiences created by the masses and quickly promote them, adding sharp weapons to the leap forward in production. ...

Leading cadres in many regions and units have gone deep into the front line of production and achieved good results in rapid production growth. The news from Huainan Coal Mine, Taiyuan Iron and Steel, and Taiyuan Heavy Industry Bureau published in today's newspaper are some examples.

Now, there are only twenty-odd days left until the end of June, a crucial moment for realizing the great call to "strive to complete half of the annual plan in the first half of the year." It is hoped that the leading comrades on the industrial and transportation fronts will all rush to the forefront of production with a fighting attitude, promote a vigorous new upsurge in production, and seize a great harvest in June!

    最大的保证
    把六月变为大幅度的高产月，这是全国职工的心愿，也是工业交通战线当前大好形势发展的必然趋势。怎样促使这一伟大目标迅速、普遍地变为现实？最大的保证是各级党组织和领导干部狠抓当前生产。
    要抓生产，就要狠狠地、具体地、细致地抓。这就要求领导干部深入生产第一线，参加生产领导生产。我们党一贯坚持的这一优良作风，具有极大的威力。
    第一、可以进一步密切干部和群众的关系，鼓舞群众的革命干劲和生产积极性。正如许多钢铁工人所说：“书记、厂长到炉边，我们浑身干劲添。”
    第二、可以及时、正确地发现问题和解决问题，为生产大幅度增长扫清道路。
    第三、可以及时发现和总结群众创造的各种先进经验，并迅速推广，为生产跃进增添犀利武器。……
    许多地区、许多单位的领导干部深入了生产第一线，收到了生产迅速增长的良好效果。今天本报发表的淮南煤矿、太钢、太原重工业局等单位的消息，就是一些例证。
    现在，离六月底只有二十几天了，是实现“力争上半年完成全年计划一半”这一伟大号召的决定性时刻。希望工业交通战线的领导同志们都以战斗的姿态奔赴生产第一线，推动轰轰烈烈的生产新高潮，夺取六月大丰收！
