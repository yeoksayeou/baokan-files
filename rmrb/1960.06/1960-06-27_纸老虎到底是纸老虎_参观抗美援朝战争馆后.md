    The Paper Tiger is Ultimately a Paper Tiger
    After Visiting the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea Museum
    Huang Yanpei
          (1) Having committed all kinds of evil deeds, U.S. imperialism's sins are monstrous. But, it is a paper tiger, easily punctured. As far back as ten years ago, on June 25, 1950. Suddenly, it opened fire, towards Korea, it collectively massacred the Korean people, it dashed across the 38th parallel like a mad dog, step by step, ambitiously, approaching the Yalu River.
        (2) It aroused the patriotic and loyal Korean People's Army, aroused the righteous and brave Chinese People's Volunteers, the two sides formed a righteous and irresistible force, five battles, five victories, killing 1,090,000 enemies, including more than 397,000 American soldiers. U.S. imperialism, remember forever:
  "Heartbreak Ridge" is heartbreaking. You want to drink the water of the Yalu River, smack your mouth. You want to break through the Shangganling position, take your life.
        (3) Land battles, sea battles, air battles, the devil's crimes are endless. It cultivated countless murderous bacteria, scattered them from airplanes, to cause disease in large groups of people, to end the lives of large groups of people. Poison! Poison! People call U.S. imperialism "the plague god," U.S. imperialism itself is a germ. But, the power of the people will wipe it out completely.
            (4)
    Have you done enough evil?
    Have you disgraced yourself enough?
    No, no.
    Eisenhower has come to Asia.
    Walking east and west,
    A helicopter always follows in the
        sky,
    Lowering a very long rope.
    Shout, something bad is happening!
    Immediately hoisted onto a two-hundred-foot-high
        ladder.
    In this way, human "disaster" may be
        avoided (note).
    Can you avoid it?
  The people of the world will never forgive you.
  Shame! Shame! U.S. imperialism is ashamed to death!
  Ugly! Ugly! U.S. imperialism is ugly to death!
    Is it a tiger? It is paper. (Note) This is what Smith, the White House reporter for United Press International who traveled with Eisenhower, said.

    纸老虎到底是纸老虎
    参观抗美援朝战争馆后
    黄炎培
          （一）坏事做尽了，美帝国主义罪
    恶滔天。但，它是纸老虎，一戳即
    穿。远在十年前，6月25日，1950年。忽然，它开炮，向着朝鲜，它集体屠杀朝鲜人民，它像疯狗一样窜过三八线，一步又一步，野心勃勃地，逼向鸭绿江
    边。
        （二）激起了爱国忠勇的朝鲜人民
    军，激起了仗义勇敢的中国人民
    志愿军，双方结成正义的不可抗的力
    量，五战五捷，杀死了敌人一百零九万，中间就有三十九万七千多美
    国兵。美帝，永远记住：
  “伤心岭”上伤心。你想喝鸭绿江的水，打你的嘴。你想破上甘岭的阵，要你的命。
        （三）陆战、海战、空战，恶魔的罪行说不尽。它培养了无数的杀人细菌，从飞机散布下去，要使一大群人发生疾病，要使一大群人断送生命。毒！毒！人称美帝是“瘟神”，美帝本身就是毒菌。但是，人民群众的力量，会把它消灭干净。
            （四）
    作恶作得够了么？
    丢丑丢得够了么？
    不，不。
    艾森豪威尔来亚洲了。
    走东走西，
    天空老是跟着一只直升飞
        机，
    宕下一条很长很长的绳子。
    喊一声，不好了！
    立即吊上二百多英尺高的天
        梯。
    这一来，人间“灾难”可能
        逃避（注）。
    能逃避吗？
  全世界人民决不饶恕你。
  羞！羞！美帝羞死！
  丑！丑！美帝丑死！
    是老虎吗？是纸。（注）跟着艾森豪威尔旅行的合众国际社白宫记者史密斯这样说。
