Plague God Crosses the Street

Ten, a crushing defeat and a return to obscurity, where is the old pomp and circumstance? Asia today belongs to the people.

"Peace and friendship" are mere pretenses, clever words and flowery language are empty sounds. A street crossing of ten thousand miles startles with nightmares, the three collapsing puppets are most heartbroken. Leaving the army before victory, the future dies, often causing the Plague God's tears to soak his lapel. It's hard to cover up a volcanic eruption, pointlessly running around the world, an ancient road, a west wind, a skinny horse, the setting sun in the west, the broken-hearted "Plague God" defeated and returns home.

专栏：瘟神过街

    瘟神过街十、大败而归往日威风何处寻？亚洲今日属人民。
  “和平友好”徒装扮，巧语花言空好音。万里过街惊噩梦，三垮傀儡最伤心。出师未捷前途死，常使瘟神泪满襟。火山爆发难遮，空自奔走天涯，古道西风瘦马，夕阳西下，断肠“瘟神”败回家。
