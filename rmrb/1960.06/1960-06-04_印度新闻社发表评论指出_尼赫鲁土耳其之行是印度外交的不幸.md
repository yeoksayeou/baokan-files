    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 2nd -- The Indian News Agency published a commentary on June 1st regarding Indian Prime Minister Nehru's recent visit to Turkey, stating that Nehru's trip to Turkey was "strange" and an "unfortunate incident in diplomacy."

    The commentary said, "Today, in New Delhi, it seems no one can explain why Nehru had to visit Turkey. Neither political nor economic ties can justify this major failure of the Indian statesman."

    The commentary mentioned the strong demonstrations by the Turkish people against the Menderes dictatorial government that occurred before Nehru's visit to Turkey, as well as the Soviet government's condemnation of the Turkish government for providing bases for American U-2 spy planes to violate Soviet airspace. The commentary said, "Under these circumstances, the signing of a joint communiqué with Prime Minister Menderes, who was about to fall from power, is perhaps a very strange insult to Indian foreign policy. The tragedy of this matter is that the person responsible for formulating this policy is himself responsible for the sad distortion of this policy."

    印度新闻社发表评论指出
    尼赫鲁土耳其之行是印度外交的不幸
    新华社新德里2日电　印度新闻社1日就印度总理尼赫鲁最近访问土耳其一事发表评论说，尼赫鲁土耳其之行是“奇怪的”，是“外交上的不幸”。
    评论说，“今天在新德里似乎没有人能够解释为什么尼赫鲁一定得到土耳其去访问。不管政治联系还是经济联系，都不能为这位印度政治家的大失败辩解。”
    评论谈到了在尼赫鲁访问土耳其之前发生的土耳其人民反对曼德列斯独裁政府的强大示威，以及苏联政府谴责土耳其政府向美国Ｕ—2型间谍飞机提供基地侵犯苏联领空的事件。评论说，“在这种情况下，（尼赫鲁）同快要倒台的曼德列斯总理签署联合公报，也许是对印度外交政策的非常奇怪的谩骂。这件事的悲剧是：这种政策的制定者本人对这种政策进行可悲的歪曲是负有责任的。”
