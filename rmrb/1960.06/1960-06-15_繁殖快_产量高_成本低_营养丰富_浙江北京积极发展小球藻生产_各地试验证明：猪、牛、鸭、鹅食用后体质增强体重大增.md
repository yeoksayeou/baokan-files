Fast Reproduction, High Yield, Low Cost, Rich Nutrition
Zhejiang and Beijing Actively Develop Chlorella Production
Local Trials Prove: Pigs, Cattle, Ducks, and Geese Gain Strength and Weight Significantly After Eating

(Our report) Since the beginning of this year, the area for cultivating chlorella in Zhejiang Province has reached more than 2,130 mu. Many counties and cities such as Rui'an, Yueqing, Pingyang, Wuxing, and Wenzhou have seen a mass movement of "everyone starting, farms, teams, and communes all cultivating chlorella."

Chlorella has strong photosynthesis, reproduces quickly, has a high yield, and its nutritional content is higher than barley, wheat bran, soybeans, and white rice. Using chlorella solution or dried powder mixed with flour or other grains can make fragrant and delicious pastries. Because it can be reproduced in large quantities in a short period of time, many places use it as pig feed, and the weight gain of pigs is very significant.

Initially, when using chlorella to feed pigs, many people did not believe that it could raise pigs well. However, after half a year of practice, it has been proven that chlorella is indeed a nutritious and good feed, establishing a high reputation among the masses. In Longshan Livestock Farm of Chengguan Commune, Rui'an County, 580 pigs gained an average of 10 liang (500 grams) of weight per day after being fed chlorella, while pigs fed ordinary feed gained an average of 8 liang (400 grams) of weight per day. Pingyang Seed Stock Farm used chlorella to feed pigs, with the highest average daily weight gain of one and a half jin (750 grams). Feeding geese with chlorella also resulted in significant weight gain. The livestock farm of Mayu Commune in Rui'an conducted an experiment with ten dairy cows. After eating chlorella, the average daily milk production increased from 53 jin (26.5 kg) to 64 jin (32 kg), a net increase of 11 jin (5.5 kg). The Yongjia County Organ Livestock Farm, Pingyang Seed Stock Farm, and Yueqing Baixiang Commune Livestock Farm fed chlorella to twenty third-class pigs, and after one and a half months, seventeen of them were upgraded to first-class pigs. These pigs had rosy skin, shiny coats, straighter backs, and stronger physiques. The breeders reflected that they did not believe "green water" could feed pigs in the past, but now they truly recognize that chlorella is a good feed.

The Party committees at all levels in Zhejiang Province attach great importance to the cultivation of chlorella and have listed it as an important measure for developing animal husbandry. In February of this year, the Provincial Party Committee promoted the experience of Rui'an County in large-scale chlorella cultivation at the provincial on-site animal husbandry production conference held in Rui'an County. Rui'an County has 1,150 production teams and 2,981 livestock farms cultivating chlorella on a large scale, producing more than 15 million jin (7.5 million kg) of algae solution in the past three months. Longshan Livestock Farm of Chengguan Commune used chlorella to replace fine feed for all 580 pigs, saving 5,000 jin (2,500 kg) of fine feed in two months. In order to cultivate chlorella on a large scale, the Yueqing County Party Committee determined that the secretary and minister in charge of animal husbandry and the director of the animal husbandry office would be responsible for chlorella production. They also vigorously promoted the advanced experience of Yuecheng Commune in using greenhouse seedlings to break through technical barriers, organized on-site visits, and strengthened the determination of the majority of cadres and masses to cultivate chlorella, quickly forming a mass movement of chlorella production throughout the county. Now, the county has cultivated 1.15 million jin (575,000 kg) of chlorella.

In the movement of large-scale chlorella cultivation, Zhejiang localities have solved the equipment and technical problems according to the principle of "taking soil as the main thing and making use of local resources." If there are no cultivation ponds, they use old wooden barrels, stone troughs, water tanks, etc. instead. If chemical fertilizers are too expensive, they use a certain proportion of fermented human manure instead. If there is insufficient technical strength, they adopt methods such as on-site meetings, short-term training classes, apprenticeships, and organizing technical instruction.

According to the experience of Wenzhou Prefecture, if brick and stone are used as cultivation ponds for chlorella seeds, the cost is too high and it is not easy to promote. Many places have successfully cultivated chlorella in mud pits and paddy fields, which can reduce the cost by 12 yuan per square meter. On the basis of the above achievements, the CPC Wenzhou Prefectural Committee and the county Party committees, in addition to continuing to summarize experience, are preparing to launch a mass movement of catching up, surpassing, and overtaking, to vigorously develop chlorella production more, faster, better, and more economically, requiring every 100 pigs in the region to have half a mu of production ponds, so that all 7 million pigs in the region can eat chlorella.

(Our report) The people's communes in the suburbs of Beijing are widely promoting and producing chlorella as pig feed. In the past month or so, more than 800 pig farms in the city have set up equipment for cultivating and reproducing chlorella and have begun large-scale production. Some units that started earlier have already used it to feed pigs and have achieved good results.

Chlorella is a green algae plant that grows in fresh water. It has a wide range of adaptability for living and reproduction, and has the characteristics of fast reproduction, high yield, rich nutrition, and easy cultivation.

The CPC Beijing Municipal Committee attaches great importance to the utilization of this algae. As early as this spring, it instructed the Beijing Academy of Agricultural Sciences to use algae seeds moved from the south and artificially propagated to produce and feed them in some pig farms. Shangmatou Livestock Farm in Tong County, which used it earlier, built four ponds for cultivating and reproducing chlorella in March, each with a volume of about eight cubic meters. Now, at a cost of more than five yuan per day (excluding equipment investment), it can produce nearly 3,000 jin (1,500 kg) of concentrated chlorella solution. This farm has done many sets of comparative experiments. They selected two batches of twelve fattening pigs. After eleven and fourteen days of comparative experiments, under the same feeding conditions, pigs fed with chlorella concentrate gained 81% and 107% more weight per day than ordinary pigs. The results of a twelve-day comparative experiment on sixteen weaned piglets showed that the nine pigs fed chlorella gained 0.53 jin (265 grams) per day, while the pigs that were not fed chlorella gained only 0.31 jin (155 grams) per day. Using chlorella to feed lactating sows and breeding boars, the piglets gain weight quickly, and the quality of boar semen is improved. The Beijing Food Company's duck farm has also achieved good results in using chlorella to stuff ducks. Some people who did not believe that a pond of green water could feed pigs in the past, now see the huge effect and praise it repeatedly, saying: "Chlorella is really good. Feeding pigs with it replaces fine feed, they grow fast and love to gain fat. Everyone calls it a treasure among treasures."

The technology for making chlorella is not complicated, and the equipment is very simple. It can be produced in greenhouses, or in open-air ponds, and even in large vats. In the process of cultivation and reproduction, chicken and pig manure or human urine are generally used as culture solution, mixed with a certain proportion of algae seed stock solution. After four to five days of reproduction, it can be precipitated, harvested and fed.

The promotion and spread of chlorella has begun to form a mass movement in the suburbs of Beijing. Party committees at all levels, in accordance with the instructions of the Municipal Party Committee, have formed professional teams led by the secretary to carry out production and organized special personnel to inspect and supervise. The relevant departments of the city and counties (districts) have also adopted training classes, on-site meetings and other methods to train technical personnel. The people's communes that have gained experience are responsible for providing technical guidance to the surrounding communes, with designated areas of responsibility. A trial promotion network composed of technical personnel from the city, counties (districts), communes, and pig farms has also been initially formed. Now there are 882 pig farms in the city producing chlorella. Under the leadership of the Party Secretary of Chengguan People's Commune in Shunyi County, cultivation and reproduction equipment was built in ten large and medium-sized pig farms overnight and quickly put into production. In more than twenty days, the entire commune cultivated more than 130,000 jin (65,000 kg) of algae seed stock solution. Driven by this commune, nearly 60% of the pig farms in Shunyi County have begun to produce chlorella. (Attached picture)

    繁殖快  产量高  成本低　营养丰富
    浙江北京积极发展小球藻生产
    各地试验证明：猪、牛、鸭、鹅食用后体质增强体重大增
    本报讯　今年以来，浙江全省繁殖小球藻的面积已达二千一百三十多亩，瑞安、乐清、平阳、吴兴、温州等许多县、市出现了“人人户户动手、场场、队队、社社繁殖小球藻”的群众运动。
    小球藻光合作用很强，繁殖快、产量高，营养成分比大麦、麸皮、大豆、白米高，用小球藻溶液或干粉拌在面粉或其他粮食中，可以制成香甜可口的糕点。由于能在短期内大量繁殖，许多地方用作猪饲料，猪增重十分显著。
    最初，用小球藻喂猪，很多人不相信可以把猪养好。但经过半年来实践证明，小球藻确实是营养丰富的好饲料，在群众中树立了很高的威信。瑞安县城关公社龙山畜牧场五百八十头猪，喂小球藻以后，平均每天体重增加十市两，喂一般饲料的猪平均每天增加体重八两。平阳种畜场用小球藻喂猪，最高的平均每天增重一斤半。用小球藻喂鹅增重也很显著。瑞安马屿公社畜牧场用十头奶牛做试验，吃小球藻后，日产奶量平均由五十三斤提高到六十四斤，净增十一斤。永嘉县机关畜牧场、平阳种畜场、乐清白象公社畜牧场原有二十头三类猪喂小球藻，一个半月后有十七头提升到一类猪，这些猪只皮肤红润，毛色光亮，背弓转平、体质健壮。饲养员反映说：过去不相信“绿水”能喂猪，现在真正认识到小球藻是个好饲料。
    浙江省各级党委十分重视小球藻的繁殖工作，把它列为发展畜牧业的一条重要措施。今年2月份，省委在瑞安县召开的全省畜牧生产现场会议上，推广了瑞安县大面积繁殖小球藻的经验。瑞安县全县有一千一百五十个生产队，二千九百八十一个畜牧场大量繁殖小球藻，近三个月来就生产了藻液一千五百多万斤。城关公社隆山畜牧场，五百八十头生猪全部用小球藻代替精饲料，在两个月中节省精饲料五千斤。乐清县为了大面积繁殖小球藻，县委确定由分管畜牧的书记、部长和畜牧办公室主任专管小球藻生产工作，并大力推广以乐城公社采用温室育苗，突破技术关的先进经验，组织现场参观，使广大干部和群众繁殖小球藻的决心更大，迅速在全县形成了生产小球藻的群众运动，现在全县已繁殖小球藻一百十五万斤。
    在大面积繁殖小球藻运动中，浙江各地根据“以土为主，因陋就简”的原则，解决了设备和技术关。没有培养池，他们就利用旧木桶、石槽、水缸等代替；化学肥料成本高，就改用一定比例的发酵人粪代替；技术力量不足就采用现场会、短期训练班、以师带徒、组织技术传授等办法解决。
    据温州专区经验证明：小球藻种池如用砖、石作培养池成本太高，不易推行；许多地方在泥坑和水田里培养小球藻已获得成功，这样每平方米面积中，能降低成本十二元。在取得以上成绩的基础上，中共温州地委和各县委除继续总结经验外，准备掀起追、赶、超群众性运动，更多、更快、更好、更省地大力发展小球藻生产，要求全区每一百头猪都有半亩生产池，使全区七百万头猪都能吃上小球藻。
    本报讯　北京郊区各人民公社广泛推广和生产小球藻作为猪饲料。最近一个多月以来，全市已经有八百多个猪场设置了培养繁殖小球藻的设备，开始大量生产，一部分动手较早的单位已经用来喂猪，收到了良好的效果。
    小球藻是在淡水中生长的绿藻植物，生活、繁殖的适应范围很广，具有繁殖快、产量高、营养丰富、容易培植的特点。
    中共北京市委十分重视这种藻类的利用工作，早在今年春天就指示北京市农业科学院用南方移来经过人工繁殖的藻种，在一部分猪场中生产和喂用。利用较早的通县上马头畜牧场3月份修建了四个培养繁殖小球藻的池子，每个容积约八立方米，现在每天化五元多的成本（不包括设备投资）可生产小球藻浓缩液近三千斤。这个场曾作了很多组对比试验，他们选择了两批共十二头育肥猪，经过十一天和十四天的对比试验，在同等饲养条件下，喂小球藻浓缩液的猪比普通猪每天分别增加体重81％和107％；对十六头断奶仔猪进行十二天对比试验的结果，九头喂小球藻的猪日增重零点五三斤，没有喂小球藻的猪日增重仅零点三一斤。用小球藻喂哺乳母猪和种公猪，仔猪增重快，公猪精液品质提高。北京市食品公司养鸭场用小球藻填鸭也收到良好效果。一些过去不相信一池绿水能喂猪的人，现在看到了巨大的效果都连连称赞说：“小球藻真正好，用它喂猪顶精料、长的快爱上膘，人人称它宝中宝。”
    制造小球藻的技术并不复杂，设备也很简单，能在温室内生产，也可在露天建池生产，甚至在大缸内也能繁殖。在培养繁殖过程中，一般是采用鸡、猪粪或人尿作培养液，掺入一定比例的藻种原液，经过四至五天的繁殖就可沉淀采收喂用。
    繁殖推广小球藻，在北京郊区现已开始形成群众运动。各级党委按照市委指示，由书记挂帅，组成了专业队伍进行生产，组织专人检查督促。市、县（区）有关部门还采取训练班、现场会等方式培养技术人材。已经取得经验的人民公社，对周围的公社负责进行技术指导，分片包干。一个由市、县（区）、公社、猪场的技术人员组成的试验推广网也已初步形成。现在全市生产小球藻的猪场已有八百八十二个。顺义县城关人民公社在党委书记主持下，一昼夜就在十个大中型猪场中建成培养繁殖设备，很快投入生产，在二十多天内，全公社培养了十三万多斤藻种原液，在这个公社的带动下，顺义县全县近60％的猪场都已开始生产小球藻。（附图片）
