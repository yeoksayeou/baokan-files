    Many Ways to Save Cotton Cloth!
    The Qianjin Canvas and Leather Goods Cooperative in Weiyang District, Xi'an, has vigorously promoted the comprehensive utilization of raw materials. In the past year or so, without requesting a single foot of cloth from the state, they have produced more than 50 kinds of products, totaling 856,000 pieces, saving the state more than 1.2 million meters of cotton cloth.
    The raw materials of this factory are entirely waste materials and scraps from factories and enterprises. The cooperative members steam, wash, and machine-process the acquired waste tarpaulins, water hoses, broken masks, fly waste, and rags, and then sort them according to material size and color. Large pieces are cut into aprons, small pieces are cut into shoulder pads, and even smaller pieces are sewn together to make leggings, foot covers, gloves, furnace hats, sock bottoms, shoe pads, and manure buckets. Some scraps less than a finger's width are beaten into shoe sole linings. Unusable materials are turned into fluff (recycled cotton) to replace good cotton as padding for shoulder pads and chair cushions. Last year, they used more than 30,000 jin of cotton in production, only more than 300 jin of which was supplied by the state, and the rest was solved by this kind of "poor man's method."
    The Qianjin Canvas Cooperative has fully utilized waste materials and tapped the potential of materials, powerfully supporting industrial construction and appropriately supplying the needs of the people's lives.

    节约棉布办法多！
    西安未央区前进帆布皮件社大搞原材料综合利用，一年多来，没有要国家拨给一尺布，却生产出产品五十多种，八十五万六千多件产品，为国家节约棉布一百二十多万米。
    这个厂的原料完全是工厂、企业的废料和下脚料，社员们把收购来的废棚布、水龙带、破口罩、飞花、破布等，经过蒸煮、洗刷、机器弹，按材料大小、色彩不同加以分选。大块的裁成围裙，小的裁成垫肩，再小的并缝在一起做成护腿、足盖、手套、溶炉帽、袜底、鞋垫、马粪斗等，有些不到一指宽的碎布，又打成鞋底褙；实在不能用的弹成绒毛（再生棉），来代替好棉花作垫肩、椅垫的絮棉。去年他们生产上用了三万多斤棉花，只有三百多斤是国家供应的，其它全靠这种穷办法解决。
    前进帆布社充分利用废旧料，挖掘物资潜力，是有力地支援了工业建设，适当供应了人民生活需要。
