    The Gravedigger's Journey
    Lin Ling
    There are people in this world who are digging their own graves. Everything they do hastens their own demise, because their impending fate is already sealed.
    What seals the fate of these people is not the "omnipotent" God, nor the King of Hell who controls the "book of life and death," but the laws of historical development that decree their death. As human society develops to the final stage of capitalism—imperialism—its inherent nature of monopoly and decay dooms it to a faster path to death. The financial oligarchs who control the military and political power of imperialism, and the officials who represent them, are accelerating imperialism's demise through their actions. The more they intensify the implementation of imperialist war and aggression policies, the more they encounter resolute opposition from the people of the world, and the closer they move step by step towards their graves. Chairman Mao said: "The days of the imperialists are numbered, because they do all kinds of evil, specially foster the reactionaries in all countries who are against the people, seize large amounts of colonies, semi-colonies and military bases and threaten peace with atomic war. In this way, they are forcing more than ninety percent of the people of the world to rise up against them." This is precisely the fate of death that the laws of historical development have decreed for imperialism. Therefore, in the final analysis, the gravediggers are the imperialists themselves.
    In order to maintain economic hegemony, monopoly capital has no choice but to forge an inextricable link with militarism. Militaristic countries are destined for a bad end. For example, Germany (under Wilhelm and Hitler) and Japan dug their own graves in the first and second World Wars, jumped in, and were buried in the earth. Now, U.S. imperialism is combining monopoly capital with militarism, and therefore they are bound to follow the same path as the German fascists, ending up in the graves they have dug for themselves. Eisenhower is the embodiment of this mixture of monopoly capitalism and militarism. Eisenhower and his ilk are scurrying around like homeless dogs, especially during his recent "visit" to Asia, to accelerate the execution of the gravedigger's task, precariously arranging for war, and ensuring that they bury the fate of U.S. imperialism in the wars they launch. In other words, American militarism and monopoly capital will be buried together in the graves they are diligently digging day and night, to fulfill their "historical mission".
    Eisenhower travels to Asia, covered in dust and dirt. This is the journey of a gravedigger. Strangely, it seems as if there really is a judge holding the book of life and death, supernaturally guiding Eisenhower, this chieftain of imperialism, through a nightmarish "death visit." Clearly hearing the people of the Philippines already voicing their opposition to the "visit," he still staggered to Manila to settle a matter of the heart; clearly seeing the anti-American upsurge erupting like a raging fire among the Japanese people, with angry shouts nationwide forbidding the plague god from entering their territory, he was still determined to go, until he fully realized, at the last moment, that if he stubbornly insisted on going, his dog's life would be in danger, only then did he "postpone" his trip, full of chagrin; and finally, he had no choice but to go to Okinawa to make a fool of himself; clearly hearing the roar of ten thousand cannons on the Fujian front of China, conveying the strong will of China's 600 million people to strike the plague god, he still fearfully sneaked into Taiwan, Chinese territory, to engage in conspiracies; clearly seeing the South Korean people, who had driven out Syngman Rhee, chasing Heo Jeong and sternly warning Eisenhower not to set his poisonous foot on Korean soil, he still went there with ulterior motives...
    All this makes us see more clearly that Eisenhower, this gravedigger destined by fate, is making a "journey" like a homeless dog, which is determined by the nature of imperialism. We see no "majesty", "deterrence" or "strength" of U.S. imperialism here, and even less do we see Eisenhower's personal "prestige." Here, we only see the gravedigger walking the dead end of the road, stubbornly enduring the people's scolding, and risking his life to take reckless chances.
    However, everything goes against his wishes, and will inevitably go against his wishes: Eisenhower thought that "visiting Japan and meeting with Kishi" would support his faltering partner Nobusuke Kishi and save the reputation of U.S. imperialism in Japan, which had already been "swept away," but the result was that the Japanese people opposed Nobusuke Kishi more fiercely, demanded the abolition of the U.S.-Japan military treaty more resolutely, and demanded that the U.S. military get out of Japan more decisively; Eisenhower thought that his "grand visit" to South Korea could consolidate the position of Heo Jeong, who had just been brought to power, but who knew that before the plague god's footprint even touched Korean soil, the roar of the Korean people made Syngman Rhee's "worshippers" lose face, made the U.S., which harbored Syngman Rhee, even more cursed, and made Heo Jeong's position even more shaky; the result obtained in the Philippines was also "contrary to expectations," and the result of going to Taiwan was even more disastrous.
    The life of U.S. imperialism is getting shorter and shorter, it is at the end of its rope, on its last breath, and death is waiting for them. The storm of struggle of the Asian people and the people of the world is getting stronger day by day; the flames of opposition to U.S. imperialism are getting more and more fierce day by day. Imperialism can never escape the inevitable fate of final destruction. Eisenhower's bandit trip did not achieve the purpose of robbery, but only dug his own grave deeper.

    掘墓者的旅行
    林陵
    世界上有一批人自己给自己掘坟墓。他们的所作所为，没有一件不是催促自己早日灭亡。因为他们即将死亡的命运已经被注定。
    注定这种人命运的，并不是“主宰一切”的上帝，也不是掌管“生死簿”的阎王爷，而是历史发展的规律注定了这种人的死期。人类社会的历史发展到资本主义的最后阶段——帝国主义，它那垄断的、腐朽的本性，就注定了自己的命运更快地走向死亡；而掌握帝国主义军政大权的金融寡头和代表他们的执政官，却用自己的行动加速帝国主义的死亡。因为他们越是加紧执行帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策，就越遭到世界人民的坚决反对；他们就越是一步一步走向死亡的坟墓。毛主席说：“帝国主义者的命运不会很长了，因为他们尽做坏事，专门扶植各国反人民的反动派，霸占大量的殖民地、半殖民地和军事基地、以原子战争威胁和平。这样，他们就迫使全世界百分之九十以上的人正在或者将要对他们群起而攻之。”这正是历史发展规律给帝国主义注定了死亡的命运。所以，归根结底，掘墓者就是帝国主义者自己。
    垄断资本为了维持经济的霸权，不得不和军国主义结不解之缘。军国主义国家的命运是没有好下场的。如像德国（威廉的和希特勒的）和日本在它们所发动的第一次和第二次世界大战中自己给自己掘好坟墓，跳下去葬身土中。现在美帝国主义又是把垄断资本和军国主义相结合，因而他们也必然和德国法西斯一样走到自己所掘的坟墓里去。艾森豪威尔是垄断资本主义和军国主义混合体的体现者。艾森豪威尔之流急急如丧家之犬似的东奔西走，特别是最近到亚洲来“访问”，就是为了加速执行掘墓者的任务，岌岌不可终日地布置战争，并使他们在自己所发动的战争中早日葬送美帝国主义的命运。也就是说，美国军国主义和垄断资本将一起深埋在他们日夜勤劳挖掘的坟墓里，以完成自己的“历史使命”。
    艾森豪威尔风尘仆仆地赶到亚洲来旅行。这是掘墓者的旅行。说也奇怪，好像真有执掌生死簿的判官，鬼使神差地牵引着艾森豪威尔这个帝国主义的头子进行恶梦般的
  “死亡访问”。明明听到菲律宾的人民已经发出反对“访问”的呼声，还是踉踉跄跄地闯到马尼拉去了却一段心事；明明看到日本人民正在如火如荼地掀起反美的怒潮，全国各地怒喊不许瘟神犯境，他还是决心要去走一遭，直到完全看到如果硬着头皮去碰，狗命就将危在旦夕的最后时分，才一肚子懊丧地“延期”前去，而最后，还是无可奈何地到冲绳岛去出一出丑；明明听到中国福建前线的万炮齐鸣，传出中国六亿人民痛击瘟神的坚强意志，还是胆颤心惊地钻到中国领土台湾去搞阴谋；明明看到轰走李承晚的南朝鲜人民正在赶许政并厉声警告不许艾森豪威尔的毒脚踏上朝鲜土地的时候，他还是心怀鬼胎地前去了……
    这一切就使我们更加看清楚，艾森豪威尔这个命里注定的掘墓者，进行丧家之犬的“旅行”，是被帝国主义的本性注定了的。这里丝毫看不出美帝国主义的“威严”、“威慑”和“强大”，也更看不出艾森豪威尔本人的“威望”，这里只看到掘墓者走着日暮途穷的末路，硬着头皮去承受人民的责骂，冒着生命危险去瞎碰运气。
    但是，一切事与愿违，而且必然会事与愿违：艾森豪威尔自以为“访日晤岸”是支持他摇摇欲坠的伙伴岸信介和挽回美帝国主义在日本已经“扫地”的威信，结果却是使日本人民更加激烈地反对岸信介，更加坚决地要求废除日美军事条约，更加决绝地要求美军滚出日本；艾森豪威尔自以为“大驾光临”南朝鲜，可以使刚被扶上台的许政能巩固地位，谁知道瘟神的脚迹还没有踏上朝鲜土地，朝鲜人民的怒吼声使李承晚的“崇拜者”无颜露脸，使窝藏李承晚的美国更受咒骂，使许政的地位更加动摇；在菲律宾得到的结果，也同样是“事与愿违”，到台湾去的结果，更是狼狈不堪。
    美帝国主义的寿命越来越短了，日暮途穷，奄奄一息，死亡在等待他们。亚洲人民和世界人民的斗争风暴，一天比一天强大；反对美帝国主义的火焰，一天比一天猛烈。帝国主义永远逃不脱最后灭亡的必然命运。艾森豪威尔的强盗旅行并没有达到打家行劫的目的，只不过是把自己的坟墓挖得更深一些罢了。
