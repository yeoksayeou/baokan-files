    Establishing High-Yield Plots, Implementing New Measures: Wheat Harvest Achieved
    Shandong Tancheng County Overcomes Drought by Implementing Intercropping of Soybeans and Wheat, Achieving Growth in Both Total and Per Unit Output
    Shanxi Linyi County Massively Constructs High-Yield Plots, Transforming Barren Land into Fertile Land, with Higher Unit Yields Than in Previous Years
    Hunan Shaodong County Changes Extensive Farming Techniques, Transforming Large Areas of Low-Yield Wheat into High-Yield Wheat
    Jinan, June 17th (Reported by this newspaper) – Shandong's Tancheng County has achieved a bumper wheat harvest on one million mu of land. According to the harvesting situation in various communes and teams, the average per mu yield of wheat in the county has increased compared to the bumper year of 1958. Due to the expansion of the sown area, the total output has increased even more.
    Multiple planting and multiple harvests, as well as high yields and multiple harvests, are the main characteristics of this year's bumper wheat harvest in the county. Two years ago, this county was still one of the ten low-yield counties in Shandong Province. After communization in 1958, the unified use of manpower and material resources, the adjustment of land, and the construction of water conservancy projects, reservoirs and wells were dotted everywhere, and canals crisscrossed, thus turning 600,000 mu of low-lying land that was afraid of drought and waterlogging into fertile land, and realizing the garden-like management of low-yield fields with rough cultivation, thus achieving continuous bumper harvests for two years. This year, one million mu of wheat was planted on 1.35 million mu of grain fields in the county, an increase of 150,000 mu compared to last year. The county vigorously developed more than 400,000 mu of high-yield wheat plots. These high-yield plots included early planting, late planting, and various types of wheat seedling demonstration fields. Cadres used the advanced experience of these high-yield plots and demonstration fields to guide general fields, achieving overall high yields.
    Another characteristic of the high wheat yield in this county is the planting of 400,000 mu of "wind-blown snow" – intercropping wheat and peas, an increase of more than 320,000 mu compared to last year. This is a major reform in the cropping system in the autumn of last year, summarized by the Tancheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China based on the experience of the masses. "Wind-blown snow" is an important measure to increase the yield per unit area. Under the same conditions, it increases production by more than 30% compared to single-cropping wheat. The benefits of planting "wind-blown snow" are: fully utilizing land and fertilizer efficiency; strong disaster resistance; high wheat yields and double harvests; wheat crop failure but still having peas to harvest; early planting and early harvest, which is conducive to adjusting crop rotations.
    The county's bumper wheat harvest was achieved in the face of severe drought. From sowing last year to the yellow ripening of wheat this year, the average rainfall in the county was only 53 millimeters, half less than the same period last year. Under these circumstances, Party committees at all levels fully mobilized the masses, organized an anti-drought army, and carried out a continuous four-month anti-drought struggle. In the face of severe drought, they adopted the method of deploying "five groups" – waterwheel groups, bucket-throwing groups, windlass groups, hoisting rod groups, and "鸳鸯罐" (a type of water carrying device) groups – so that "six waters" – rivers, reservoirs, Jiang (likely referring to the irrigation canal), springs, ponds, and wells – were all directed to the fields. With the heroic spirit of "if the sky doesn't rain, people will rain," they ensured the normal growth of one million mu of wheat. The idea that the harvest relies on people, not the heavens.
    Taiyuan, June 17th (Reported by this newspaper) – Shanxi Province's Linyi County has achieved a bumper harvest of wheat in large areas of high-yield plots.
    At the beginning of June, the joy of the first summer bumper harvest from vigorously developing high-yield plots enveloped the entire Linyi County. Along the well-connected field roads, rows and rows of endless high-yield plots were filled with rolling wheat waves, glittering with golden light, with tall and strong wheat stalks and full grains in the ears. In the Shuangchi Management Area of ​​Beixin Commune, which was previously known as the county's low-yield area, this year more than 3,000 mu of high-yield plots achieved a yield of 400 jin per mu. The county has already harvested 150,000 mu of wheat, with an average yield of 234 jin per mu, an increase of about 20% compared to previous years. According to the results of harvesting in three communes, they have generally exceeded the contracted production plan.
    Linyi County is one of the earliest and best counties in Shanxi Province to carry out the agricultural revolution. The county's 250,000 people launched a large-scale revolution in the agricultural cropping system last winter and this spring, thus completely changing the remnants of small-scale farming with scattered plots, excessive ridges, and uneven heights, so that more than 90% of the wheat fields were connected into continuous plots. With the progress of agricultural reform, a series of changes have also been realized in cultivation techniques. The county launched a competition campaign of infertile land catching up with fertile land, sloping land catching up with flat land, dry land catching up with irrigated land, small fields catching up with large fields, and rotational crops catching up with regular crops. The county has universally promoted the experience of having livestock pens, fertilizer pits, and toilets arranged in three directions around the fields. The 740,000 mu of wheat fields were universally top-dressed four times, with an average fertilizer application per mu increasing by 1.2 times compared to the past. At the same time, large-scale joint prevention and control measures were adopted to universally control pests three times, cultivate twice, and spray phosphorus once, controlling the development of pests and diseases.
    This year's wheat harvest in Linyi was achieved in the face of drought. Thanks to the 250,000 people in the county carrying out the anti-drought struggle, using water rationally, and irrigating rationally, the irrigated area was expanded by nearly one time in the face of a hundred days of drought. A new atmosphere of "drought in the sky but not drought in the land" has emerged in many high-yield plots. The unified leadership, unified measures, and unified standards of the high-yield plots have popularized high-standard operations, thus ensuring the balanced development of all cultivated land.
    Changsha, June 17th (Reported by this newspaper) – Shaodong, Hunan Province's famous red banner county for high wheat yields, has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of 80,000 mu of wheat this year, with both total output and average per mu yield exceeding last year. After threshing and acceptance inspection, many high-yield plots with per mu yields of over 200 jin have emerged in the county. The 4,152 mu of wheat in Huochangping Commune, after inspection plot by plot, achieved an average per mu yield of 305 jin of dry wheat.
    Shaodong County has a large population and little land, with an average of only one mu of land per person. In the past, although the masses planted some wheat after autumn every year, it was only to survive the spring and summer famine of the following year. Therefore, the cultivation was extensive, and the yield has been very low over the years, with only 70-80 jin per mu in bumper years. Thus, wheat has always been labeled as a "low-yield" crop, and many people regard it as a "miscellaneous grain." The fact that this county has achieved a bumper wheat harvest this year shows that the potential for increasing wheat production in the South is great. Reforming the cropping system and comprehensively promoting advanced technical measures are the main experiences of Shaodong County in achieving large-scale wheat production increases. In the main links of careful land preparation, deep plowing, promotion of improved varieties, application of sufficient base fertilizer, strip seeding with dense planting, and prevention and control of pests and diseases, all links are closely linked and grasped to the end. The county adopted the method of combining professional team management with the masses, fixed more than 31,000 members to form 4,100 permanent professional teams, and established a "one-whip" management responsibility system of "three guarantees" (guaranteeing work, guaranteeing output, and guaranteeing cost) to the team, and "five determinations" (determining area, determining work points, determining quality, determining time, and determining rewards and punishments) to the group, with measures implemented to the plot and responsibility assigned to the person, overcoming the "tight at the beginning and loose at the end" phenomenon in wheat field management over the years.
    The bumper wheat harvest has brought great encouragement and inspiration to the people of Shaodong. The county plans to expand wheat planting by 240,000 mu this winter, including 150,000 mu of newly reclaimed wasteland. (Attached pictures)

    建立丰产方　推行新措施　小麦获丰收
    山东郯城县战胜干旱实行豆麦混作，总产单产均有增长
    山西临猗县大建丰产方瘦地变肥地，单位产量高于往年
    湖南邵东县改变粗放耕作技术，大面积小麦低产变高产
    本报济南17日电　山东郯城县百万亩小麦获得丰收，据各社、队收打情况，全县小麦平均亩产量比丰收的1958年都有提高，由于播种面积扩大，总产量增长更多。
    多种多收和高产多收，是这个县今年小麦大丰收的主要特点。两年前，这个县还是山东省的十个低产县之一。1958年公社化以后，统一使用人力物力，调整了土地，兴修了水利，水库水井星罗棋布，渠道纵横成网，从而使怕旱怕涝的六十万亩洼地变成了良田，使耕作粗糙的低产田实现了园田化，因此取得了连续两年的大丰收。今年这个县一百三十五万亩粮田种上一百万亩小麦，比去年增加了十五万亩。全县大搞小麦丰产方四十多万亩，这些丰产方中有早茬，有晚茬，还有各种类型麦苗指挥田，干部以这些丰产方和指挥田的先进经验来指挥一般田，达到全面丰产。
    这个县夏粮高产的另一特点是种植四十万亩“风搅雪”——小麦与豌豆混作，比去年增加了三十二万多亩。这是中共郯城县委总结了群众的经验，去年秋季在耕作制度上的一项重大改革。“风搅雪”是提高单位面积产量的重要措施。同样的条件，它比单作的小麦增产30％以上。种“风搅雪”的好处是充分发挥地力和肥效；抗灾性强；小麦丰收双高产，小麦歉收有豌豆；早种早收，有利于调茬口。
    这个县小麦大丰收，是在战胜严重干旱情况下取得的。从去年播种到今年小麦黄熟，全县平均降雨量只有五十三毫米，比去年同期减少一半。在这种情况下，各级党委充分发动了群众，组织了抗旱大军，进行了持续四个多月的抗旱斗争。在干旱严重的情况下，他们采取了水车群、抛斗群、辘轳群、吊杆群、鸳鸯罐群“五群”上阵的办法，使河、库、江、泉、池、井“六水”统统归田，以天不下雨人下雨，丰收在人不在天的英雄气概，保证了百万亩小麦正常生长。
    本报太原17日电　山西省临猗县大面积丰产方的小麦获得了丰收。
    6月初，大搞丰产方第一个夏季大丰收的喜悦，笼罩了整个临猗县，沿着四通八达的田间公路，一排排一行行一望无际的丰产方里麦浪滚滚，金光闪闪，麦秆高大粗壮，麦穗籽饱粒满。过去被称为全县低产锅底的北辛公社双池管理区一带，今年三千多亩丰产方亩产达到四百斤。全县已打的十五万亩小麦，一般平均亩产二百三十四斤，比往年增产两成左右，据三个公社收打的结果，一般都超过了包产计划。
    临猗县是山西省大搞农田革命最早最好的一个县。全县二十五万人民，去冬今春开展了一次大规模的农田耕作制度的革命运动，从而彻底改变了地块零散、垅畔过多、高低不平的小农耕作遗迹，使90％以上的麦田连片成方。随着农田改革的进行，在耕作技术上也实现了一系列的改变。全县开展了瘦地赶肥地、坡地赶平地、旱地赶水地、小田赶大田、回茬赶正茬的麦田管理竞赛运动。全县普遍推广了畜圈、肥坑、厕所三到方的经验。七十四万亩麦田普遍追肥四次，每亩平均施肥量比过去增加了一点二倍。同时采取大面积联防突击扑治的办法，普遍治虫三次、中耕两次、喷磷一次，控制了病虫害的发展。
    今年临猗小麦丰收是在气候干旱的情况下获得的。由于全县二十五万人民开展了抗旱斗争，合理用水、合理浇灌，在大旱百日的情况下，扩大了灌溉面积将近一倍。许多丰产方出现了天旱地不旱的新气象。丰产方统一领导，统一措施、统一规格，使高标准操作达到普及化，因此保证了所有耕地平衡发展。
    本报长沙17日电　湖南省有名的小麦丰产红旗县——邵东，今年八万亩小麦获得空前丰收，总产量和平均亩产量都超过去年。经过脱粒验收，全县出现了许多大面积亩产二百斤以上的丰产片，火厂坪公社四千一百五十二亩小麦，经过逐丘验收，平均亩产干麦三百零五斤。
    邵东县人多田少，平均每人仅有一亩田土，过去群众每年虽然在秋后种点小麦，但只是为了在来年度过春夏荒。因此，耕作粗放，历年来产量很低，丰收年成每亩也只有七、八十斤，这样小麦一直就被戴上“低产”帽子，许多人把它当作“杂粮”。今年这个县小麦大丰收的事实说明，南方种小麦的增产潜力很大。改革耕作制度，全面推广先进技术措施，是邵东县获得小麦大面积增产的主要经验。在精细整地、深耕、推广良种、施足底肥、条播密植、防治病虫害等主要环节上，都是环环紧扣，一抓到底。全县采取专业队管理与群众相结合的办法，固定三万一千多个社员，组成四千一百个经常性的专业队，建立“三包”（包工、包产、包成本）到队，“五定”（定面积、定工分、定质量、定时间、定奖罚）到组、措施到丘，责任到人的“一条鞭”管理责任制，克服了历年来在麦田管理上“前紧后松”现象。
    小麦大丰收给邵东人民带来了巨大的鼓舞和激励。全县计划今冬扩种小麦二十四万亩，其中新垦荒地种植十五万亩。（附图片）
