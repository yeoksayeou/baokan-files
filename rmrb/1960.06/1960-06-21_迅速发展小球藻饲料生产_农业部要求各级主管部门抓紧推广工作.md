Xinhua News Agency, 20th. The Ministry of Agriculture issued a notice requiring all localities to rapidly and universally promote chlorella feed production.

The notice said: Chlorella is a fast-growing, high-yielding, single-celled algae plant that can be used as concentrated feed for livestock and poultry. Using it to replace part of the concentrated feed for livestock and poultry is not only an effective way to solve the current shortage of concentrated feed for livestock and poultry, but also has the potential to solve the problem of concentrated feed for the large-scale development of animal husbandry in the future. At the same time, using chlorella as feed can reduce feeding costs. More than 880 pig farms in Beijing have bred and fed chlorella. In Wusheng County, Sichuan Province, all 3,027 farms are cultivating chlorella, and 2,582 of them have universally used chlorella to feed pigs. Agricultural colleges and scientific research institutions in many regions are also actively experimenting with cultivation.

The notice said: In order to rapidly promote chlorella feed so that every people's commune can produce and feed it in large quantities within a short period of time, agricultural scientific research departments in various provinces and counties that have not yet carried out this experiment should immediately conduct cultivation experiments and establish chlorella seed source bases to supply the seed sources needed for reproduction by the people's communes; agricultural administrative departments from the province to the county should immediately open training classes for cultivating chlorella to train technicians for the people's communes to produce chlorella. Each county should also select one to three pig farms as key points for feeding comparison experiments, so as to further educate the masses with practical examples and make the promotion of chlorella feed a more extensive mass movement. The notice requires the leading departments in charge of agricultural (animal husbandry) production at all levels to seize this work as an important method to solve the current shortage of concentrated feed and improve the quality of live pigs.

    迅速发展小球藻饲料生产
    农业部要求各级主管部门抓紧推广工作
    新华社20日讯　农业部发出通知，要求各地迅速普遍推广小球藻饲料生产。
    通知说：小球藻是一种生长快、产量高、可当家畜和家禽精料的单细胞藻类植物，用它代替部分家畜精料，不但是解决目前畜禽精料不足的有效办法，而且有可能解决将来大量发展畜牧业的精料问题；同时利用小球藻作饲料，可以降低饲养成本。北京市已有八百八十多个猪场繁殖喂用小球藻。四川省武胜县三千零二十七个饲养场，场场培养小球藻，其中二千五百八十二个场已普遍用小球藻喂猪，不少地区的农业院校和科学研究机关也都在积极试验培养。
    通知说：为了迅速推广小球藻饲料，使每个人民公社在短期内能大量生产喂用，各地省、县农业科学研究部门还没有进行这项试验的，要立即进行培养试验，建立小球藻种源基地，供应人民公社繁殖需要的种源；农业行政部门从省到县立即开办培养小球藻的训练班，为人民公社培训生产小球藻的技术人员。各县还应该选一至三个养猪场作为重点进行喂养对比试验，以便于用实际事例进一步教育群众，使推广小球藻饲料成为更广泛的群众运动。通知要求各级主管农业（畜牧业）生产的领导部门抓紧这项工作，作为解决当前精料不足、提高生猪质量的一个重要办法。（附图片）
