Declarations, Resolutions, and Telegrams Adopted by the 11th Session of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council

Declaration on the Situation in South Vietnam

The 11th Session of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council, held in Beijing from June 5 to 9, 1960, strongly condemns the escalating intervention of U.S. imperialism in South Vietnam and firmly demands the withdrawal of all U.S. military missions from South Vietnam.

Beijing, June 9, 1960

Resolution on the Situation in Korea

The 11th Session of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council, held in Beijing, expresses its active solidarity with the workers and people of South Korea who have risen up against the fascist rule of U.S. imperialism and its agents. The meeting salutes the heroic struggle of the workers and people of South Korea, who overthrew the Syngman Rhee clique, for freedom, democracy, and the right to live.

However, U.S. imperialists, through brutal repression and treacherous means, are supporting new puppets in order to maintain their rule over South Korea, strengthen their aggressive military bases, and perpetuate the division of Korea. These actions seriously threaten peace in Korea and the world.

Therefore, the World Federation of Trade Unions Council calls on workers and their trade unions worldwide to actively support the struggle of the workers and people of South Korea for the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea and for the peaceful reunification of the country. The World Federation of Trade Unions urges workers and their trade unions worldwide, especially from June 25, 1960, the tenth anniversary of the U.S. imperialists' launch of the war of aggression against Korea, to take all steps that can effectively support this struggle.

Beijing, June 9, 1960

Resolution on the Situation in Japan

The 11th Session of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council, held in Beijing from June 5 to 9, 1960,

Reminds workers and trade unions worldwide to be vigilant about the serious situation created by U.S. militarists in Japan. With the support of the Kishi Nobusuke government, U.S. militarists have turned Japan into a military base for aggression and have restored Japan's war industry to support its imperialist aims in Asia, Africa, and the world;

Condemns the recently revised so-called "Mutual Security Treaty" by the Kishi Nobusuke puppet government and U.S. imperialists, as well as the restoration of military relations between the Adenauer revanchist regime in West Germany and Japanese militarists;

Emphasizes that these aggressive alliances, which subject Japan to the imperialist policies of the United States and the revanchist policies of West Germany, constitute an increasing threat not only to peace in Asia but also to world peace;

Therefore, supports the militant actions of Japanese workers and people to demand the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke government, the abolition of the treaty with U.S. imperialism, the removal of U.S. military bases, and the withdrawal of U.S. troops;

It assures the Japanese workers and people that the World Federation of Trade Unions actively supports their efforts to defend peace and restore Japan's independence;

Calls on workers and trade unions worldwide to work together domestically and internationally to actively and concretely support the great unified struggle of the Japanese workers and people.

Resolution on Algeria

The World Federation of Trade Unions Council, meeting in Beijing from June 5 to 9, 1960, reiterates the World Federation of Trade Unions' consistent position in support of the Algerian workers and people in their struggle for national independence.

The De Gaulle government bears full responsibility for the continued colonial war by refusing to negotiate with the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria (in this war, the Algerian people have sacrificed more than one million lives).

The Council salutes the heroic struggle of the Algerian workers and people and expresses its full support to the people who have been fighting French imperialism for six years.

It strongly exposes the material assistance given by U.S. imperialists and the accomplices of the war policy - West German militarists.

The Council is confident that the French workers' movement will realize their unity to stop the Algerian war, immediately release all detained and imprisoned people, and establish trade union freedoms and the right to self-determination.

The Council endorses the positive results achieved by the International Trade Union Committee of Solidarity with the Algerian Workers and People, established at the initiative of the Fourth Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions. It emphasizes the call for national and international trade union organizations to participate in this committee, which should strengthen the promotion of new and more numerous initiatives to support the Algerian people until their just cause is victorious.

The Council assures the General Union of Algerian Workers that the World Federation of Trade Unions will take all initiatives to promote support movements and support the actions of Algerian trade unions.

Beijing, June 9, 1960

Resolution Supporting the Struggle of the Cuban People

The 11th Session of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council extends warm greetings to the Cuban Workers' Confederation, the Cuban workers, and the Cuban people, who are fighting heroically alongside the Cuban revolutionary government to defend national sovereignty, economic independence, national welfare, and progress.

The meeting exposes the subversive and provocative activities of U.S. imperialism against Cuba and calls on workers worldwide to be vigilant about the danger of military intervention actively planned by U.S. imperialists.

The meeting condemns the economic offensive launched by U.S. monopolies against the Cuban revolutionary regime and calls on workers and their trade unions to be vigilant about the threat of U.S. attempts to boycott Cuban ships.

The World Federation of Trade Unions Council calls on workers in all countries to strengthen their support for the heroic struggle of the Cuban working class and people against North American imperialism.

The World Federation of Trade Unions will take all measures to further develop and materialize this international solidarity of the working class.

Beijing, June 9, 1960

Declaration on the Execution and Arrest of Iranian Workers and Patriots

Terror has shrouded Iran since 1953.

Last summer, the massive strike of 30,000 brick workers in Tehran and the powerful demonstrations of students in the Iranian capital this January were bloodily suppressed by armed military forces and U.S. imperialism.

On May 4, 1960, the Iranian government executed five Iranian patriots in Tabriz, the capital of Azerbaijan Province: Javad Faroughi, Hassan Shetab, Kozrov Achari, Ali Aghim Chad, and Azuri Keranchi. In addition, seventeen patriots and workers, including one woman, were sentenced by military tribunals to imprisonment ranging from ten years to life in penal servitude. The military tribunal's trials were conducted secretly and hastily, with no respect for the principles of judicial procedure.

Alarmed by the demonstrations of the Turkish people, the Iranian government launched a massive arrest of Iranian patriots. Four of those arrested, Borouchang, Youshafei, Sharia, and Gashenbou, have recently been sentenced to death.

The World Federation of Trade Unions Council expresses its deep solidarity with the Iranian workers and people, strongly protests against the Iranian government's repressive measures, demands that the sentences not be carried out, that the reign of terror be ended, and that imprisoned patriots be released.

The Council also calls on all trade union organizations and workers of all tendencies and affiliations to vigorously support the just struggle of the Iranian workers and people.

Beijing, June 9, 1960

Declaration on the Continuing Violations of Trade Union and Democratic Rights in Greece

The 11th Session of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council strongly protests against the continuing violations of trade union and democratic rights by the Greek government and employers.

The Council condemns the constant interference of the police and civil administration in trade union affairs and workers' meetings; condemns the new arrests, exiles, and imprisonments of patriotic trade union cadres, and the brutal attack on this peaceful demonstration in Athens. It extends warm greetings to the Greek working class and trade union cadres and assures them of its active support.

Beijing, June 9, 1960

To the Workers of Spain

The World Federation of Trade Unions Council, meeting in Beijing from June 5 to 9, 1960, extends warm fraternal greetings to the Spanish workers who are waging a heroic and arduous struggle against the Franco dictatorship, for the realization of their rights and demands, and for the restoration of democracy in Spain.

The Franco government, in an attempt to suppress this struggle, carried out a series of new repressions last month. In addition, hundreds of social and political prisoners have been imprisoned for fourteen, sixteen, or even twenty years, although the Spanish Civil War ended twenty-one years ago.

The World Federation of Trade Unions Council, on behalf of its 101 million members, lodges a strong protest with the government of General Franco, demanding an end to this persecution and amnesty for all political and social prisoners and exiles.

The Council condemns the establishment of U.S. military bases in Spain and condemns the plan to establish West German bases, both of which greatly increase the danger of war in Europe.

The World Federation of Trade Unions, its national member organizations, and workers worldwide have consistently supported and sympathized with the cause of the Spanish workers and people, and reiterate their solidarity with the current struggle to eliminate the Franco fascist regime and oppose the deterioration of the living conditions of the working masses and the expansion of unemployment.

The World Federation of Trade Unions Council believes that the united struggle of the Spanish workers and people, with international assistance and support, will certainly achieve their economic and social demands, amnesty for social and political prisoners, and the end of the Franco dictatorship.

Beijing, June 9, 1960

Telegram to the Government of Congo

The 11th Session of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council, meeting in Beijing, strongly protests the unjust arrest of Julien Bukambou, General Secretary of the General Union of Workers of Equatorial Africa and a member of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council, and other trade union leaders, the closure of the headquarters of this general union, and the confiscation of its files.

We demand that you immediately release these trade union leaders and restore and respect trade union rights.

    去年夏天，德黑兰三万制砖工人的声势浩大的罢工以及今年1月伊朗首都学生的强大示威受到武装军事力量及美帝国主义的血腥镇压。
    1960年5月4日伊朗政府在阿塞拜疆省省会塔勃里兹处决了五名伊朗爱国者贾瓦德·法芦基，哈桑·拾塔布，柯兹罗夫·阿查里，阿里阿祺姆·查德和阿左里·克朗祺。此外有十七名爱国者和工人，其中包括一名妇女，被军事法庭判处从监禁十年到终身劳役的徒刑。军事法庭的审判是秘密地匆忙地进行的，丝毫不尊重司法程序的原则。
