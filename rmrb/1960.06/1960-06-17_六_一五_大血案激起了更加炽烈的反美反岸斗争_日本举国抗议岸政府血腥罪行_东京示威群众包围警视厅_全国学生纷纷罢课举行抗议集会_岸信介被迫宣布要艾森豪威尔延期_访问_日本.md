Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 16th: The Japanese people's anti-American struggle against Eisenhower's visit to Japan has achieved initial victory. Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi was forced to issue a government statement at a press conference this afternoon, announcing that the Japanese government has decided to request Eisenhower to postpone his "visit" to Japan.

The Kishi Nobusuke government's statement said: Judging from the current situation in Japan, "it is not appropriate to welcome the state guest President Eisenhower. Therefore, it has been decided to request Eisenhower to postpone his visit to Japan and to ask him to postpone the date of his visit to Japan to a suitable time when the whole country can welcome him."

Under the pressure of the increasingly powerful struggle of the Japanese people, Nobusuke Kishi had to admit at the press conference that he "has been painstakingly trying to realize President Eisenhower's visit to Japan" but "there is no way to realize it." Eisenhower's plan to insist on "visiting" Japan has finally failed.

However, the Kishi Nobusuke clique still expressed its intention to struggle desperately in the statement, claiming that they "will not resign en masse nor dissolve the Diet until the new security treaty is naturally recognized and approved."

Before issuing this government statement, Nobusuke Kishi held an emergency cabinet meeting this afternoon. After the meeting, Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama formally made this request to the US Ambassador to Japan, MacArthur II.

According to the Associated Press, the US President's press secretary has issued an official statement announcing that Eisenhower, who is "visiting" the Philippines, has agreed to the Japanese government's request to postpone his "visit" to Japan.

US President Eisenhower was originally scheduled to "visit" Japan on the 19th, plotting to establish the new Japan-US security treaty and to prop up the tottering Kishi Nobusuke cabinet. This "visit" was an important step in US imperialism's plan to establish a Northeast Asian aggressive bloc in the Far East and create tension in Asia.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 16th: Thirty thousand people from all walks of life in Tokyo today angrily surrounded the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, strongly protesting the Kishi Nobusuke government's police killing of students participating in the demonstration yesterday.

The masses held a demonstration at the gate of the Metropolitan Police Department, shouting: "You are murderers!" "The police chief resign!" "We oppose repressive measures against the people!".

At 5:30 p.m., when the news came that the Kishi Nobusuke government was forced to announce that it would request Eisenhower to postpone his visit to Japan indefinitely, thunderous applause and cheers erupted in the demonstration ranks, and the fighting spirit of the masses was even higher.

Among the 30,000 demonstrators holding a rally in front of the Metropolitan Police Department, 20,000 were students, who had earlier met at Hibiya Park. The other 10,000 were workers, members of mass organizations, and members of the Communist and Socialist parties, who first held a mass rally near the Diet.

At the mass rally held near the Diet, representatives of students, the Socialist Party, and the Communist Party spoke.

Student representatives demanded that the people must overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and smash the new Japan-US "security treaty" to avenge the murdered female student.

Communist Senator Goro Sudo emphasized that the brutal suppression of students last night was the result of the US government blaming Kishi Nobusuke for his "weak attitude towards demonstrations."

After demonstrating in front of the Metropolitan Police Department, the students went to the Diet to demonstrate, while the others continued to demonstrate on the main streets of Tokyo.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 16th: The fascist crimes of the Kishi Nobusuke government in brutally massacring students participating in the anti-American and anti-Kishi demonstrations have angered students all over Japan. Schools in various places are going on strike one after another.

The University of Tokyo—where the murdered female student Michiko Kamba was a student—various departments held meetings attended by professors this morning. Joint protest rallies were held by many departments in the afternoon. At Meiji University, the president, faculty, staff, and all students went on strike. They held a protest rally on campus.

Hosei University, Tokyo University of Education, and all other universities in Tokyo held protest rallies. These conferences lodged the strongest protests with the Kishi Nobusuke government, condemning it for killing students.

Universities closer to Tokyo, such as Shizuoka University, have sent student delegations to Tokyo to participate in today's protest demonstration.

Osaka University, Kansai University, Osaka City University, and other universities in the Kansai region of Japan went on strike today and held separate protest rallies. Then, from the afternoon, a protest rally with 5,000 students participating was held in Osaka Prefecture's Otemae Park. After the rally, the students held up banners and paraded on the streets. The banners read: "Protest against the Kishi government and the police's atrocities, mourn the victims!". The students also surrounded the Osaka Prefectural Police Headquarters to express their strong protest.

Six thousand students from universities in Kyoto held a protest rally on the campus of Ritsumeikan University, and then held up red flags and school flags with mourning bands to parade on the streets in protest.

Student representatives from Hyogo Prefecture lodged a protest with the Hyogo Prefectural Police Headquarters today.

In Hokkaido, all university student organizations have decided to go on strike for three days from today. 2,600 students from universities such as Hokkaido University, Gakugei University, and Sapporo University held a protest rally in Sapporo today. After the rally, they marched in formation on the streets and went to the Hokkaido headquarters of the Liberal Democratic Party to lodge a strong protest. The Hokkaido headquarters of the Liberal Democratic Party actually instructed the police to suppress the demonstrating students, injuring twelve students.

In Fukuoka, Kyushu, 4,500 students from various universities lodged a serious protest with the Fukuoka Prefectural Police Headquarters. The police violently beat the students, injuring more than a dozen students. University students in Akita, Nagoya, Gifu, Wakayama, Okayama, and other places launched a struggle today to protest the Kishi Nobusuke government's bloody suppression of demonstrating students.

    “六·一五”大血案激起了更加炽烈的反美反岸斗争
    日本举国抗议岸政府血腥罪行
    东京示威群众包围警视厅　全国学生纷纷罢课举行抗议集会
    岸信介被迫宣布要艾森豪威尔延期“访问”日本
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：日本人民反对艾森豪威尔访日的反美斗争获得初步胜利，日本首相岸信介今天下午被迫在记者招待会上发表政府声明，宣布日本政府决定要求艾森豪威尔延期“访问”日本。
    岸信介政府的声明说：从日本的现状看来，“对于欢迎国宾艾森豪威尔总统一事是不相宜的，因此，决定要求艾森豪威尔延期访日，并且决定要请求他把访问日本的日期推迟到能够举国欢迎的适当的时候”。
    在日本人民日益强大的斗争的压力下，岸信介在记者招待会上不得不承认，他“一直苦心孤诣地要实现艾总统的来日”“已经没有办法实现”。艾森豪威尔坚持要“访问”日本的计划终于失败。
    但是，岸信介集团在声明中仍然表示要垂死挣扎，宣称他们“在自然承认和批准新安全条约完毕以前，也不实行全体辞职，也不解散国会”。
    岸信介在发表这个政府声明以前，曾经在下午召开了内阁紧急会议。会后，日本外务相藤山爱一郎向美国驻日本大使麦克阿瑟第二正式提出了这个要求。
    据美联社报道，美国总统新闻秘书已经发表官方声明，宣布正在菲律宾“访问”的艾森豪威尔已经同意日本政府关于延期“访问”日本的请求。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔原来预定在19日到日本进行“访问”，阴谋使新日美安全条约获得成立和为摇摇欲坠的岸信介内阁撑腰。这一“访问”是美帝国主义在远东策划建立东北亚侵略集团、在亚洲制造紧张局势的重要步骤。
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：东京各界三万人今天愤怒地包围了东京警视厅，强烈抗议岸信介政府的警察昨天残杀参加示威的学生。
    群众在警视厅大门口举行示威，振臂高呼：“你们是杀人犯！”“警察头子辞职！”，“我们反对对付人民的镇压措施！”。
    下午五点半，当关于岸信介政府被迫宣布要求艾森豪威尔无限期延期访问日本的消息传来以后，在示威队伍中发出雷动的掌声和欢呼声，群众的斗争情绪更加高涨。
    在警视厅前面举行大会的三万名示威群众中，有二万名学生，他们早些时候在日比谷公园会师。其他的一万人是工人、群众团体成员和共产党和社会党的党员，他们先在国会附近举行了群众大会。
    在国会附近举行的群众大会上，学生、社会党和共产党的代表讲了话。
    学生代表要求人民一定要推翻岸信介内阁和粉碎新日美“安全条约”来为被杀害的女学生报仇。
    共产党参议院议员须藤五郎强调指出：昨天晚间对学生的残暴镇压，是美国政府责怪岸信介“对付示威的软弱态度”的结果。
    学生们在警视厅前面示威以后又到国会示威，而其它的人则继续在东京的主要街道上示威。
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：为岸信介政府残酷屠杀参加反美反岸示威的学生的法西斯罪行，激怒了日本全国各地学生。各地学校正一个接着一个地进行罢课。
    东京大学——被杀害的女学生桦美智子是这个大学的学生——各系在今天上午举行了有教授参加的会议。下午举行了许多系的联合抗议大会。在明治大学，校长、教职员和所有的学生都举行罢课。他们在校内举行了抗议大会。
    法政大学、东京教育大学和东京其他所有的大学都举行了抗议大会。这些大会向岸信介政府提出最强烈的抗议，谴责它杀害学生。
    离东京比较近的各大学，如静冈大学，已经派学生代表团前往东京，参加今天的抗议示威。
    日本关西地区的大阪大学、关西大学、大阪市立大学等今天都罢课，并且分别举行抗议集会，然后从下午起在大阪府大手前公园举行有五千名学生参加的抗议大会。大会结束后，学生们高举标语牌，在街上示威游行。标语牌上面写着：“抗议岸政府和警察暴举，向牺牲者致哀！”。学生们还把大阪府警视厅包围起来，以表示强烈的抗议。
    京都各大学学生六千人在立命馆大学校园里举行抗议大会，然后高举带丧章的红旗和校旗到街上举行抗议游行。
    兵库县学生代表今天向兵库县警察总署提出抗议。
    在北海道，所有的大学生组织已经决定从今天起罢课三天；北海道大学、学艺大学和札幌大学等大学的学生两千六百人今天在札幌举行抗议大会，会后列队在街上举行示威游行，并且到自由民主党北海道总部，提出强烈抗议。北海道自由民主党总部竟指使警察镇压示威的学生，打伤了十二名学生。
    在九州福冈，各大学学生四千五百人到福冈县警察本部提出严重抗议。警察凶暴地殴打学生，致使十多名学生受伤。秋田、名古屋、岐阜、和歌山、冈山等地的大学生，今天都展开了抗议岸信介政府对示威学生进行血腥镇压的斗争。（附图片）
