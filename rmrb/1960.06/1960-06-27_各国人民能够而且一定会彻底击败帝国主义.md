The Chinese people, in view of the current world situation, have launched a new wave of struggle against U.S. imperialism. We have achieved liberation after years of arduous struggle and are now the masters of our own destiny; we are building a strong and prosperous socialist country. However, U.S. imperialism has adopted a hostile attitude towards us from the very first day of the founding of our People's Republic. They are constantly carrying out provocations, openly provoking wars against our neighbors, and are now preparing to launch even greater military offensives against the people of China, the Soviet Union, Korea, and Vietnam. In order to carry out their heinous plans, U.S. imperialism has militarily occupied China's territory of Taiwan and other islands; turning Japan, the Philippines, Thailand, and other countries into their military bases, which have become springboards for their constant subversive activities and military actions against China, other socialist countries, and countries pursuing a neutral policy. Thus, the people in those occupied areas are burdened with endless burdens, and their lives are destroyed and corrupted. Their despicable aim is to create opposition among the people of Asian countries, and finally make "Asians fight Asians," so that U.S. imperialism can benefit.

Are these not concrete facts of life? Is this not the actual situation for many years? Therefore, is it not surprising that the determination of the Chinese people to liberate our territory of Taiwan and other islands and our righteous indignation towards the U.S. imperialists should cause surprise and anxiety among some people in the West? We must say to these people: Friends, do not look for the source of tension in the Far East from China; we absolutely do not threaten anyone! The root lies in U.S. imperialism, which is openly aggressing against China and is preparing for even greater aggression, while regarding other Asian nations and countries as slaves! If you want to eliminate international tension, if you want to uphold justice and defend world peace, then join the people's struggle to eliminate imperialism!

Eisenhower has now fled home with his tail between his legs. His trip to Asian countries to "promote understanding" was indeed a "success" because it made the people of Asian countries thoroughly understand the evil intentions of U.S. imperialism towards them. However, the setbacks suffered by Eisenhower, the direct representative of the largest monopoly capitalist group in the United States, have shaken the entire Western diplomatic community like a huge wave. The anti-U.S. patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people, which has received the full support of the Chinese people, has exposed the face of this so-called "Prince of Peace" as a despicable conspirator who attempts to maintain and even expand the privileged imperialist exploitation and plans to use force and violence against the people of all countries in the world. Now he and his accomplices already know how the people of Asian countries, especially the people of Japan and China, react to this kind of robbery.

Eisenhower tried to blame China for the shameful failure of this "trip." He seems to think we are jealous of his "sensational success" as a "representative of peace"! A person who says such things is like slapping himself in the face only because he feels better after hitting himself!

It would be strange if there were no vulgar slanders against the People's Republic of China. Our peaceful foreign policy has always been slandered; the American propaganda machine has stepped up its activities, hoping to isolate China among its neighbors and alienate us from our great ally, the Soviet Union.

Gentlemen, you will never succeed! The People's Republic of China represents all 650 million of our people. Under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party, we have stood up, we are prepared and able to defend ourselves, and we are prepared and able to help all oppressed people in the just struggle for national independence, democracy, and peace. We stand shoulder to shoulder with the Soviet Union and other countries of the socialist camp. Our friendship is eternal. From the first day of the founding of our People's Republic, this has been China's policy. This is our policy today, and it will always be our policy in the future. The people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America know this clearly. They know that China is both the initiator of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit and one of the most steadfast defenders of these principles and spirit. They also know that the Chinese people have always been unambiguous in their opposition to imperialism.

The trained tools of the imperialist newspapers and radio stations slander China for being unwilling to coexist peacefully, saying that we have abandoned our basic policies. This is completely a lie.

China is willing to coexist peacefully with anyone, even with imperialism. In fact, we must coexist with it. The existence of imperialism is an objective reality. The existence of socialist countries is also an objective reality. Now they coexist in the world. However, our willingness to coexist peacefully with imperialism does not mean that we are willing to bow and scrape to imperialism. We will never allow U.S. imperialism to plunder our own territory. We have won the independence of our country and the fruits of our socialist revolution after countless sacrifices, and we will never abandon them for the unfounded fantasy of maintaining peace with insatiable imperialists. We are also unwilling to watch imperialism turn the people of other countries into cannon fodder and turn their lands into military bases against socialist countries and endangering world peace.

The question is whether there can be peaceful coexistence does not depend solely on us. The policies of the imperialists are determined by themselves. We are not their political advisors or their chiefs of staff after all. History and experience tell us that as long as imperialism has a breath, it will think of exploiting others and using violence to achieve the goal of dominating others while breathing this breath.

That is to say, if coexistence with imperialism is to be peaceful coexistence, the people of all countries must maintain a high degree of vigilance against the conspiracies and tricks of the imperialists, maintain a high degree of combativeness and fighting spirit, and clearly show them that we will never allow them to act recklessly.

From this perspective, necessary lessons can be drawn from the unprecedented and heroic struggle of the Japanese people against U.S. imperialism and Japanese reactionaries. If the Japanese people continue to express their will in this way, they will surely move from victory to victory. They have the full support of the Chinese people in this regard, who understand the justice of their cause and value the great contribution that the Japanese people are making to the struggle to maintain peace in the Far East and the world.

U.S. imperialism is the enemy of the people of all countries. Its nature will not and cannot be changed. But the era we live in is a different era. This is an era of the rise of the people, an era in which the people overwhelm all oppressors. Therefore, this is the era of the death of imperialism. As Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out, if the people of all countries, all the people who oppose imperialism, form the broadest united front to oppose this thing that poisons mankind, this good thing can be realized much faster. The strength of the united people of all countries is invincible. Let us warn the U.S. imperialists to go back to their old home, stop interfering in the affairs of others, and stop threatening world peace. The people of all countries, as long as they form a close team, with one heart and one mind, can and will thoroughly defeat imperialism.

    各国人民能够而且一定会彻底击败帝国主义
    宋庆龄
    中国人民鉴于目前的世界局势，掀起了反对美帝国主义的斗争的新浪潮。我们经过多年的艰苦斗争获得了解放，现在已成了自己命运的主人；我们正在建设一个强大繁荣的社会主义国家。但是，美国帝国主义从我们人民共和国成立的第一天起就对我们采取了敌对的态度。他们不断进行挑衅，公然对我们的邻国挑起战争，现在又在准备对中、苏、朝、越等国人民进一步发动更大的军事进攻。为了推行他们的穷凶极恶的计划，美帝国主义用军事力量霸占了中国的领土台湾和其他岛屿；把日本、菲律宾、泰国以及其他国家变成了他们的军事基地，成为他们对中国、其他社会主义国家和奉行中立政策的国家经常进行颠覆活动和采取军事行动的跳板。这样，被占领的那些地方的人民身上压着无穷的负担，他们的生活被破坏和败坏了。其卑鄙的目的是在亚洲各国人民中间造成对立，最后使“亚洲人打亚洲人”，而使美帝国主义得到好处。
    难道这些不是生活中的具体事实吗？难道这不是多年以来的实际情况吗？因此，中国人民解放我们的领土台湾和其他岛屿的决心和我们对美帝国主义者的义愤竟会在西方某些人士中间引起惊讶和不安，这难道不令人惊奇吗？我们必须对这些人说：朋友，不要从中国身上找远东紧张局势的根源；我们绝对不威胁任何人！根源在于公开侵略中国并且正在准备更大的侵略、同时把其他亚洲民族和国家视为奴隶的美帝国主义！如果你想消除国际紧张局势，如果你想维护正义和保卫世界和平，那就参加人民消灭帝国主义的斗争吧！
    艾森豪威尔现在已经夹着尾巴逃回家去了。他的“促进谅解”的亚洲国家之行的确是“成功”的，因为它使亚洲各国人民彻底了解美帝国主义对他们怀抱的罪恶意图。但是，美国最大的垄断资本集团的直接代表艾森豪威尔遭到的挫折像巨浪一样震动了整个西方外交界。得到中国人民全力支持的日本人民的反美爱国正义斗争，已经揭穿这个所谓“和平王子”的面目，原来他是一个企图保持甚至扩大帝国主义剥削特权、策划对全世界各国人民使用武力和暴力的卑鄙的阴谋家。现在他和他的同伙已经知道亚洲各国人民、特别是日本人民和中国人民对这种强盗行径有怎样的反应。
    艾森豪威尔企图把这次“旅行”的可耻的失败归咎于中国。他似乎认为我们妒忌他充当“和平代表”的“引起轰动的成功”！一个人说这种话就好像是打自己的耳光只是因为在打过以后会觉得好受一些！
    要是不对中华人民共和国进行下流的谩骂，那倒奇怪了。我们的和平的外交政策一直受到诽谤；美国宣传机器加紧进行活动，希望使中国在邻国中间陷于孤立，并离间我们和我们伟大的盟邦苏联的关系。
    先生们，你们永远不会成功！中华人民共和国代表着我们全体六亿五千万人民。在伟大的中国共产党的领导下，我们已经站起来了，我们准备并且有能力保卫自己，准备并且有能力帮助一切被压迫人民争取民族独立、民主和和平的正义斗争。我们同苏联和社会主义阵营的其他国家并肩站在一起。我们的友谊是永恒的。从我们人民共和国成立的第一天起，这一直是中国的政策。这在今天是我们的政策，将来也永远是我们的政策。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民清楚地知道这一点。他们知道中国既是和平共处五项原则和万隆精神的首倡者，又是这些原则和精神的最坚定的保卫者之一。他们也知道，中国人民在反对帝国主义方面一向是毫不含糊的。
    帝国主义报纸和电台的受过训练的工具诬蔑中国不愿意和平共处，说我们抛弃了我们的这些基本的政策。这完全是谎言。
    中国愿意同任何人和平共处，甚至同帝国主义和平共处。事实上，我们必须同它共处。帝国主义的存在是一种客观的现实。社会主义国家的存在也是客观的现实。现在它们并存在世界上。然而我们愿意同帝国主义和平共处，这并不意味着我们愿意对帝国主义卑躬屈节。我们决不容许美帝国主义掠夺我们自己的领土。我们经过无数的牺牲以后才赢得我们国家的独立和我们的社会主义革命的成果，决不会为了同贪得无厌的帝国主义者保持和平这种没有根据的幻想就放弃它们。我们也不愿意眼看帝国主义使其他国家的人民沦为炮灰，使他们的国土沦为反对社会主义国家和危害世界和平的军事基地。
    问题在于，有没有和平共处并不单单取决于我们。帝国主义者的政策是他们自己决定的。我们终究不是他们的政治顾问，也不是他们的参谋长。历史和经验告诉我们，只要帝国主义还有一口气，它在喘这一口气的时候就会想到剥削别人和使用暴力来实现统治他人的目标。
    这就是说，如果要同帝国主义的共处是和平共处，各国人民对帝国主义者的阴谋诡计必须保持高度的警惕，保持着高度的战斗性和斗争精神，并且明确地向他们表明我们决不容许他们胡作非为。
    从这个角度来看，可以从日本人民正在进行的反对美帝国主义和日本反动派的空前的、英勇的斗争中吸取必要的教训。如果日本人民继续以这种方式表现他们的意志，他们肯定将从胜利走向胜利。他们在这方面得到中国人民的全力支持，中国人民了解他们的事业的正义性，重视日本人民正在对维护远东和世界和平的斗争作出的巨大贡献。
    美帝国主义是一切国家人民的敌人。它的本性是不会改变的，也是不能改变的。但是我们所生活的这个时代是一个不同的时代。这是人民兴起的时代，人民压倒一切压迫者的时代。因此，这是帝国主义死亡的时代。如毛泽东主席所指出的，如果一切国家的人民，一切反对帝国主义的人民结成一个最广泛的统一战线来反对这个毒害人类的东西，这种好事情就能更加快得多地实现。团结一致的各国人民的力量是不可战胜的。让我们正告美帝国主义者，滚回他们的老家去，停止干涉别人的事务，停止威胁世界和平。各国人民只要结成紧密的队伍，一心一德，就能够而且一定会彻底击败帝国主义。
