Decisive Battle on the Front Line
This year's industrial production plan is a plan for continued and substantial growth on the basis of the two years of the Great Leap Forward, a plan that requires a great deal of effort to achieve.

The Party calls on us to break with convention and complete half of this year's annual plan in the first half of the year, which is an even more demanding requirement that requires a great deal of effort to achieve.

The requirements are high, but they are entirely achievable. The extraordinary technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the first five months of this year has given us the most powerful weapons and created the most favorable situation. Consolidating and promoting the achievements of this movement, and strengthening the new weak links that have emerged in the torrent of activity, can rapidly, comprehensively, and substantially increase production levels.

The problem now is: time is pressing, and the decisive moment is in June, the last month of the first half of the year. In this month, whoever can seize every minute and every second, promote advanced experiences at the fastest speed, and strengthen weak links at the fastest speed, will be able to achieve victory. And whoever acts more slowly will miss the opportunity. In a word, the key lies in what methods are used to promote advanced experiences and what methods are used to strengthen weak links.

Leading cadres going to the production front line, working with the masses, conducting on-site research, promoting on-site, and solving problems on-site is the fast method. Sitting in the office listening to reports, reading materials, making resolutions, and issuing instructions is the slow method.

In order not to miss the opportunity and to ensure the completion of half of the annual plan in June, we must unhesitatingly adopt the former method.

Go to the grassroots immediately, the decisive battle is on the front line.

    决战在第一线
    今年的工业生产计划，是在两年大跃进的基础上继续大幅度增长的计划，是必须花费很大的力气才能实现的计划。
    党号召我们打破常规，在上半年完成今年全年计划的一半，这更是要花费很大力气才能实现的要求。
    要求高，但又是完全可以实现的。今年前五个月不寻常的技术革新和技术革命运动，给了我们最有力的武器，造成了最有利的形势。巩固、推广这个运动的成果，加强在万马奔腾的激流中出现的新的薄弱环节，生产水平就可以迅速地、全面地、大幅度地上升。
    现在的问题是：时间紧迫了，决战的时刻就在六月，这是上半年最后的一个月。在这个月里，谁能够抓紧每一分每一秒，用最快的速度推广先进经验，用最快的速度加强薄弱环节，谁就能够取得胜利。而谁要是行动得缓慢一些，他就会坐失良机。一句话，关键在于用什么方法去推广先进经验，用什么方法加强薄弱环节。
    领导干部到生产第一线去，和群众一起，就地研究，就地推广，就地解决问题，这是快的方法。只是坐在办公室里听汇报，看材料，作决议，发指示，这是慢的方法。
    为了不失时机，确保在六月份内完成全年计划的一半，必须毫不迟疑地采取前一种方法。
    立即到基层去吧，决战是在第一线。
