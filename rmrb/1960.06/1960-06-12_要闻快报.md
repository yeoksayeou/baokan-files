	Party Committee Holds Enlarged Meeting in Key Workshop
	The Party Committee of the Nanjing Puzhen Rolling Stock Plant, in order to ensure a substantial increase in production in June, recently held an enlarged meeting of the Party Committee in the steelmaking workshop, which is the plant's weak link and also a key production department. Workers spoke freely and aired their views, fully exposing contradictions and proposing solutions to problems. The Party Committee immediately studied a plan to improve work, requiring workshop leaders and relevant departments to quickly resolve problems in production; and the Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee led a work team to work alongside the workers and assist in their work. As a result, key problems were quickly resolved, the workers' enthusiasm was greatly increased, and steel production rose sharply.

	Shanghai Launches Large-Scale Inventory Clearance Campaign
	In order to put all accumulated materials into production, Shanghai is carrying out a large-scale movement to clear out materials. Now, all districts, bureaus, factories, government offices, neighborhoods, military units, schools, and rural people's communes have taken action. The focus of the material clearing is scrap iron and steel and other metals, followed by machinery and equipment, etc. The Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant cleared out more than ten tons of scrap iron and steel from various corners in just one evening. Some factories with better-organized campaigns have begun to concentrate on sorting out materials, mobilizing the masses to comprehensively utilize them, and improving the material management system.

	Jiangxi Commerce Supports Agriculture with Complete "Four Networks"
	The commercial departments of Jiangxi Province, taking the county as a unit, have comprehensively adjusted commercial outlets, establishing a storage and transportation network, a technical instruction network, and an agricultural tool repair and fitting network from the county to the commune and production team levels, with the commercial supply network as the center, to comprehensively support agricultural technical transformation in a fast, efficient, high-quality, and economical manner. At present, more than eighty counties in the province have initially achieved complete "Four Networks."

		Regularly Summarize and Promote Innovation Achievements
	The Xi'an People's Enamel Factory holds regular technical revolution review meetings to ensure that the inspection, summary, and promotion of the technical revolution movement are regularized and institutionalized.
	The first and fifteenth of each month are the factory's technical revolution review days. On this morning, the Party, government, labor union, and youth league leaders of the factory and workshops form a review team to inspect the implementation and promotion of the originally planned innovation projects in each workshop, affirm achievements, and point out shortcomings. After the leaders' review, the workshops organize workers to learn from each other, conduct technical demonstrations, and exchange experiences. In the evening, a factory-wide employee meeting is held, at which the Party Committee Secretary makes a review report, summarizing the innovation achievements and experiences of the previous stage, and proposing the innovation direction and tasks for the next stage. This approach ensures the continuous development of the technical innovation movement.

		Mass Mobilization, Widespread Popularization of Experience
	When the Shanghai Huafeng Woolen Mill began to focus on consolidating, promoting, and improving the achievements of technical innovation, there were two different opinions: some people advocated that a small number of people should do it, organizing specialized technical forces to retrofit equipment; most people advocated "everyone should participate, everyone should promote it." The Party General Branch decided to adopt the latter approach, mobilizing all employees to speak freely, debate, appraise, and promote. As a result, in less than half a month, the utilization rate of innovation projects increased from 50% to 95%, and the output of the main product - knitting wool - increased by 24.5%.
