Not the Road (Three Poems)
— A Bandit's Travel Song

Why is Zhao Puchu so flustered, rushing here in such a hurry?
With the face of a jackal, darting east and west across the Pacific.
Playing tricks: Secretly calculating, deceiving heaven to cover the truth,
Ravenously swallowing, a deadly poison soup.
Putting on airs, Swelling his face to appear fat.
Forcibly paying a visit, forcibly paying a visit.
The anger of the Rising Sun, the running dog frantically has nowhere to hide.
A head-on blow, a cold shoulder for breakfast.
Consider this, A prodigy is not born from the sky,
Blood debts must ultimately be repaid in blood.
Hard to resist, enemies meet head-on everywhere.
Shouts from all directions, shouts from all directions.
Sacred China, would it allow demons to run rampant?
Cannon fire roars, providing a "grand performance" for you.
Laughing miserably, the soul is seen vanishing early in the street,
Praying to ghosts cannot prolong fate.
Mighty in prestige, hundreds of millions of people vow to bury the plague god.
The cannon fire roars even louder! The cannon fire roars even louder!

    不是路（三首）
    ——强盗旅行曲
    赵朴初为甚慌张，急急忙忙到这厢？豺狼相，东钻西窜太平洋。耍花腔：算盘暗打瞒天账，血口狂吞夺命汤。装模样，脸皮打肿充肥胖。硬来相访，硬来相访。怒火扶桑，走狗皇皇没处藏。当头棒，闭门羹当早茶尝。试思量，天骄不是从天降，血债终当用血偿。难招挡，冤家处处迎胸撞。八方喧嚷，八方喧嚷。神圣炎黄，肯许么魔任跳梁？炮声响，轰轰为汝做“排场”。笑凄惶，过街早见精魂丧，祷鬼难留命运长。声威壮，亿民誓把瘟神葬。炮声更响！炮声更响！
