How I Study Chairman Mao's Writings
Wei Shuqin, Salesperson, Harbin No. 7 Department Store

Learning to Do Revolutionary Work Well
I was born into a poor family. After liberation, I finished elementary school and was admitted to Jinzhou Trade School, but I dropped out after only half a year due to illness. In 1954, I became a salesperson at Harbin No. 7 Department Store.

After starting work, under the cultivation and education of the Party, I wanted to do more work for the Party and the people, but I always failed. Sometimes I even made mistakes. For example, during the clothing reform in 1956, I thought, how could customers look good in their new clothes without a nice pair of shoes to match? As a shoe seller, I should find a way, so I purchased 4,000 pairs of leather shoes from the leather shoe factory. But because the style of the shoes did not meet the customers' requirements, only a few pairs were sold in two years, causing a backlog of more than 60,000 yuan in state funds. I shed tears over this. The Party branch secretary talked to me, encouraging me not to lose heart, to learn from my failures, and to work boldly. He told me to study political theory and to learn from the working methods of Comrade Qiao Shuhua (an advanced worker and Party branch committee member in our store). I was interested in learning Qiao Shuhua's working methods, and I usually paid attention to learning from him. But studying political theory? Could I, with my limited education, understand it? Would I be able to use it? I was a little hesitant. One day, I said to Qiao Shuhua: How can I learn your working methods? He smiled and said, "First, you must have the correct stand and viewpoint. I used to be like you, wanting to do good work, but it didn't turn out as I imagined. If the Party hadn't sent me to Party school to study theory for half a year, I wouldn't have any methods." He gave me some study methods, encouraged me to study well as long as I was determined, and gave me a popular philosophy reader, inviting me to study with him. From that time on, I began to study theory. At the beginning, I was very enthusiastic, bought several books, and wanted to read all the books at once. But because I didn't study properly, just skimming through them like reading novels, the results were not very good. In addition, there were many terms that I didn't understand, so I became a little discouraged. I thought, I can't study "philosophy"; Qiao Shuhua can study because he went to Party school. Soon, right-wingers took advantage of the Party's rectification movement to launch an attack on the Party. Some people in our store also used big-character posters to spread right-wing fallacies. I was very angry when I saw this. I knew they were talking nonsense, but I couldn't argue with them at the debate. But Qiao Shuhua used many of Chairman Mao's words to argue with those people, refuting them to the point of silence. This made me realize that theory is not only a weapon for transforming our thinking and doing good work, but also a weapon for fighting against bad people and bad things. In the later stage of the rectification movement, Qiao Shuhua, Wang Honghua, and I, along with two others, organized a philosophy study group and began to study in a planned way.

Study Chairman Mao's Writings
We started by studying Ai Siqi's "Outline of Lectures on Dialectical Materialism." It took us more than half a year to learn some basic philosophical knowledge. We also learned many of Chairman Mao's words quoted in the book, but because we didn't know how Chairman Mao explained them in the original work, this led us to the idea of reading Chairman Mao's writings directly. Since I had never read Chairman Mao's books before, I wasn't sure if I could understand them. One night, I found a copy of "On Practice" and read it through. I felt that it was more comprehensive and deeper than reading the quotations in "Outline of Lectures on Dialectical Materialism." Although there were still some problems that I couldn't understand, and even some words that I didn't recognize, I felt more interested than reading other books, and the more I pondered, the more I felt that Chairman Mao's words were very correct. The next day, I told Qiao Shuhua and Wang Honghua about my idea of reading Chairman Mao's writings. They were very happy to hear this, because they had the same idea. In this way, several of us began to study Chairman Mao's philosophical works.

Chairman Mao's writings are simple and easy to understand, but to understand and grasp their essence, one must be down-to-earth, study hard, and put in hard work. I didn't realize this at the beginning of reading Chairman Mao's writings. I didn't think carefully when reading, but only memorized some idioms and interesting words. For example, "If you want to know the taste of a pear, you have to transform the pear and eat it yourself," "Failure is the mother of success," "A fall into the pit, a gain in your wit" etc. Although I remembered them, I didn't even understand the general meaning. Later, I changed this reading method, reading and studying carefully. If reading it once didn't work, I would read it twice. If two times didn't work, I would read it three or four times. If reading a long passage didn't work, I would read a short passage. And I would think, compare, analyze, and study in light of reality while reading, so that I could understand Chairman Mao's writings more deeply. For example, when I read "On Practice," when I read the principle that "If people want to achieve victory in their work, that is, to obtain the desired results, they must make their thinking conform to the laws of the objective external world, and if they do not conform, they will fail in practice," I thought of the past when we caused a backlog of goods because we did not conduct investigation and research and relied on "wishful thinking." This showed that our thinking did not conform to the laws of the objective external world and made the mistake of subjectivism. To do a good job as a salesperson, we must make our subjective understanding correctly reflect objective laws.

Constant Learning and Constant Practice
Studying Chairman Mao's writings is to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to transform our subjective world, correctly understand the objective world, and do a good job as a salesperson. For example, I used to think that if some salespeople argued with customers, it was not a one-sided affair, and some customers were "difficult to serve" and deliberately caused trouble for the salespeople. After studying "On Contradiction," and based on the principles of internal and external causes, the principal contradiction and the principal aspect of the contradiction, I analyzed it and realized that the main reason for the quarrel between customers and salespeople was on the salesperson's side, because no customer deliberately came to the store to quarrel with the salesperson and get angry. The quarrel between salespeople and customers was mainly caused by an insufficiently enthusiastic service attitude and improper work methods. In the second half of 1958, our store launched a competition to learn from "Tianqiao," and the service attitude was greatly changed. The phenomenon of salespeople arguing with customers disappeared. I thought, now I have found a way to solve the contradiction between salespeople and customers. But soon, some customers reported: Now, the store is very enthusiastic, but don't go if you don't have money. The enthusiasm of the salespeople makes it impossible for you to leave the counter. At that time, the leaders of the Party branch led us to find the reasons. I began to feel a little puzzled: If the salesperson's service attitude is not enthusiastic or proactive, the customer's reaction is like a "stake." If they are enthusiastic and proactive, they say "too enthusiastic." What is the best way to do it? I was a little confused. At this time, I consulted Chairman Mao's writings, looked for a theoretical basis, and studied the problems that I couldn't understand. Chairman Mao said that there is no thing in the world without contradiction, and there is no world without contradiction; when the old contradictions are resolved, new contradictions arise. After repeated deliberation, I realized that the contradictions that appeared after the change in service attitude were new contradictions that arose as the old contradictions were overcome. The emergence of new contradictions shows that our salespeople still lack a comprehensive understanding of the customers' psychology, and lack a concrete analysis of the contradictions. In order to find a way to solve this new contradiction, according to Chairman Mao's teaching that specific problems should be analyzed concretely, I paid attention to studying this problem in my work. Through observation, analysis, and research, I realized that this was mainly due to a lack of research on customer psychology, and that it was impossible to analyze and treat different customers specifically. In fact, among customers, there are distinctions between classes, men and women, old and young, and there are also distinctions in hobbies and personalities. Their living and working environments are also different. This requires our salespeople to investigate and analyze, and to judge the characteristics of various customers according to their appearance, gaze, and language. Whether they come to the store to visit, buy things, or choose first and then come back to buy, we must treat them differently according to their different purposes. For customers who come to the store to visit, we must show them the kind of goods they want to see, and make a key introduction to a certain characteristic (price, performance, etc.) of the kind of goods they want to know, so that customers have a understanding of the goods and give them a feeling of relaxation, which avoids not distinguishing the purpose of customers coming to the store, and persuading people to buy goods with all their strength, making some visiting customers embarrassed and having opinions on the salespeople. Observation and analysis in practical work also made me realize that the salesperson's language reception plays a great role for the customer. Because language is a tool for expressing thoughts, for the same thing, people's thoughts and feelings are different, and when speaking, the tone and feelings are also different. For example, an old lady came to buy cloth and asked, "Comrade, how much does this cloth cost per foot?" "Fifty cents!" "Tsk tsk! This jinx!" The old lady left dissatisfied. This is because the salesperson comrade was having a purely commercial mentality, thinking that the salesperson's work was inferior, and he had no good feelings to answer the customer, and was angry as if he wanted to quarrel with someone. However, a salesperson who wholeheartedly serves the people, every word of theirs should be full of the idea of ​​serving the people, and should be sincere and kind. Of course, some people lack the exercise of language art and are not good at expressing their thoughts and feelings, and say good things as bad things or say them unpleasantly. For example, when someone greets a customer, they say: "Comrade, are you buying these shoes?" It makes the customer say, "Don't you let me look if I don't buy them?" When taking care of customers trying on shoes, they say: "Comrade, do these shoes fit you?" The customer suspects that the salesperson is trying to take advantage of him. If you say: "Comrade, is this shoe size right for you?" The customer will not have any disgust. Through these practices, I deeply felt that to be a good salesperson, one must establish the idea of ​​wholeheartedly serving the people, study Mao Zedong Thought, and improve work methods, so that one's subjective wishes (good service attitude) are unified with objective reality (customer needs, psychology).

Through the study of Chairman Mao's world outlook and methodology, I realized that it is not enough to be a good salesperson with only a good service attitude. It is also necessary to have a strong view of serving politics, production, and consumers. We often encounter this situation in our work: a worker runs to the store three or five times to buy a satisfactory pair of shoes or a piece of clothing. This is inconvenient for customers and hinders production. How to solve this contradiction? Different contradictions require different solutions. I thought, if we could deliver the goods to construction sites and factories, wouldn't it be convenient for customers, save manpower, and increase production? The Party branch supported my view. From then on, we often braved the wind and rain and defied the severe cold to deliver goods to factories, construction sites, and workshops, achieving "delivery as needed, where needed," and even "night delivery." Changed the thinking of "waiting for customers at the door" and "waiting for goods at the door" and selling whatever we have. Many workers praised us and said: "The style of salespeople in the new society is high. We must learn from your spirit of preferring to work hard ourselves and not making it difficult for others."

Frequent Writing and Constant Improvement
After a period of repeated study and repeated practice, I felt that I had gained a lot, but it was difficult to say exactly what I had gained. I thought, when learning culture, you have to take an exam to test your grades at a certain stage, and when doing work, you have to summarize and draw lessons from experience at a certain stage. Then, what method can be used to summarize and improve the gains from studying theory? After a collective discussion in the group, everyone decided to use the method of writing study notes to summarize the gains from theoretical study. I was very happy, but I was also afraid of not writing well, because I had never written an article before, and I couldn't even write a letter. But then I thought, writing notes is to improve the quality of study, writing is better than not writing, and it doesn't matter if you don't write well. When I took the first draft of my study experience to the group discussion, everyone said that I was a "book copier." I spent several more days writing the second draft. After the group discussion, they said that theory and practice were separated. When I turned around to write again, I wrote it like this: One day, I received a female customer in her forties who came to buy sandals. According to the method of analyzing specific objects specifically, I recommended light gray sandals to her. I thought she would be satisfied, but she insisted on buying a pair of red sandals. I thought it was strange. I didn't help her choose, and she left unhappily. Later I learned that she was buying shoes for her daughter. I regret it very much… This is empiricism. During the discussion, some said it was very good, and others said it was principles plus examples. After several repeated discussions, I was a little unconfident that I could write an article. At this time, the secretary of the Party branch said to everyone at the group meeting: "You have never written anything before, and it is inevitable that you will not write well the first two times. Don't be discouraged. Writing study notes is a good way to check your learning achievements. Don't everyone say that the harvest is great? If you have a harvest, you can write." After listening to these words, I felt enlightened. At that time, I thought: Although I have not written it several times, I have forced myself to read a lot of books and think about a lot of problems. I have also improved somewhat in writing. So I plucked up the courage again and, after more than two months, wrote more than ten times, this note was finally recognized by the group. Later, under the guidance of the editorial department of the "Learning Theory" magazine, after modification and supplementation, it was published under the title "The Style That a Salesperson Should Have." After several months of theoretical study and adhering to the method of writing study notes, my confidence and enthusiasm in learning became more and more sufficient, and my gains became greater and greater. Practice made me realize that: writing study notes is not only a method of exercising one's writing ability, but more importantly, it deepens the understanding of theory and better uses theoretical viewpoints to analyze and study practical problems. For each note written, it is necessary to repeatedly study the theoretical articles, collect, analyze, and study many practical problems. Finally, write down the things you feel the deepest into notes. For two years, I have insisted on this method and have written more than fifty study notes and articles, and published more than twenty in newspapers and periodicals.

Due to the promotion of the Great Leap Forward situation, the thinking of the comrades in our study group has become more open. We thought that industry and agriculture are doing scientific research, so isn't there any scientific research topics in commercial work or salesperson work? But what to study? I couldn't figure it out for a while. One day, our group watched the movie "Looking for Love," and everyone discussed it, thinking that this movie distorted the image of the people's salesperson. Some people advocated studying the salesperson's work and writing a script to fight against it. Under the leadership of the Party branch, after several discussions by the group, it was decided to study nine topics such as "The Communist Style of Salespeople," "The Language Art of Salespeople," and "The Service Attitude of Salespeople." I was assigned three questions: "The Communist Style of Salespeople," "Salespeople Should Be Knowledgeable," and "The Language Art of Salespeople." In order to study "The Language Art of Salespeople," I studied Stalin's "Marxism and Linguistics" and "Soviet Salespeople" "Talk About Commodities" and other books, and also used string shifts and holidays to visit and observe in various stores. I wrote down whatever I gained. After continuous learning and research, I initially completed the topics I was assigned in half a year, and after discussion and modification by all the comrades in the group, I finally wrote them. Through this practice of theoretical research, I realized the importance of linking theory with practice more clearly, and more clearly realized that using theory to study business or writing articles are important methods for learning theory well. This method helped me deepen my understanding of theory, urged me to read a lot of books, and initially found out the working rules of salespeople. Now, the nine topics studied by our group have all been completed and compiled into a book called "The Communist Style of Salespeople," which has been published by Heilongjiang People's Publishing House.

In the past year or so, I have given more than sixty lectures. In so many lectures, I deeply realized that this is also a good way to learn. Because if you want to make others understand your lectures, you must first study hard yourself. Every lecture requires you to read more books, such as "On Contradiction," "On Practice," and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." These books have to be reviewed several times when preparing the draft. In the process of preparing the draft, from determining the topic, organizing the materials, to writing the draft, it is a learning process of repeatedly studying theory in light of practice. Especially because the audience is different each time, in order to make your lectures targeted, you have to understand the situation more, which is very beneficial to enriching your perceptual knowledge, exercising your thinking ability, and better learning theory and applying theory. Organizing a draft is much more difficult than writing a study note, and the gains are much greater. For example, when I was preparing the draft of "Establishing a Solid Proletarian World Outlook," in addition to repeatedly reading Chairman Mao's writings, I also read more than a dozen articles in Red Flag magazine and other related articles, and spent four nights writing the draft. After discussion by the study group, everyone believed that the draft did not explain the concept of the two worldviews thoroughly, especially the analysis and criticism of the bourgeois viewpoint was not deep enough. So I collected various bourgeois viewpoints on the mass movement, and reviewed the relevant parts of Chairman Mao's "Report on the Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" and the booklet "Be a Proletarian Revolutionary." It further made me realize that whether or not to have a revolutionary mass movement is a fundamental issue for our party to carry out revolution and construction, and it is also an important sign to distinguish bourgeois revolutionaries and proletarian revolutionaries. In order to better gain experience, receive education, and improve myself from each lecture, I carefully listened to the questions raised by the audience after each lecture, so that I was benefited. Giving theoretical lectures to others is not only a good way to publicize Marxism-Leninism, but also to urge and spur yourself to learn.

In the past two years, under the Party's kind teaching and cultivation, and with the enthusiastic help of comrades, I have drawn wisdom and strength from Chairman Mao's writings, and have done a little bit of work that I should do for the Party and the people. I assure the Party that I will always listen to Chairman Mao's words, study Chairman Mao's writings, be a good student of Chairman Mao, and be a people's salesperson who is both red and expert.

    我是怎样学习毛主席著作的
    哈尔滨市第七百货商店售货员　魏淑琴
    为做好革命工作而学习
    我生在一个贫苦的家庭里，解放后，念完小学，便考入了锦州贸易学校，因生病只念半年，就退学了。1954年到哈尔滨第七百货商店当售货员。
    参加工作以后，在党的培养教育下，很想为党为人民多做些工作，但总做不好，有时还犯错误。比如，在1956年服装改革时，我想，顾客要穿一身漂亮的服装，没有一双好鞋配搭着怎能相称呢？自己是卖鞋的，应当想办法，于是，我就到皮鞋厂购进了四千双皮鞋。但因鞋的样式不适合顾客要求，两年时间才卖了几双，给国家积压资金六万多元。为这事我背后掉过眼泪，党支部书记找我谈话，鼓励我不要灰心，要从失败中吸取教训，大胆地工作；他告诉我要好好学习政治理论，要学习乔淑华同志（我们商店的先进工作者、党支部委员）的工作方法。向乔淑华学习工作方法我倒有兴趣，平时也很注意向他学习。可是学政治理论，我这么点文化能学懂吗？学了会用吗？心里有些犹豫。一天，我跟乔淑华说：怎样才能学到你的工作方法呢？他笑了笑说：“首先要有正确的立场观点。我从前也跟你一样，心想做好工作，但作起来就不是想像的那样了。要不是党送我进党校学半年理论，我也不会有什么方法。”他给我讲了一些学习方法，鼓励我只要下决心就能学好，又送给我一本通俗哲学读本，约我同他一起学习。从这时起，我就开始学习理论。乍开始学习，积极性很高，买了好几本书，恨不得一口气把所有的书都读完。但由于学的不得法，像看小说似的一溜而过，结果收效不大，再加上有许多名词术语弄不懂，就有点信心不足了。心想，我学不了“哲学”；乔淑华能学是因为他进过党校。不久右派分子乘党整风的时机，向党发起了进攻，我们商店也有人利用大字报散布右派谬论。自己看到这些很生气，明知他们是胡说八道，可是在辩论会上说不出个道理来。而乔淑华却用了许多毛主席的话跟那些人论战，驳得他们哑口无言。这才使我认识到理论不仅是改造思想、做好工作的武器，而且也是跟坏人坏事作斗争的武器。在整风运动后期，乔淑华、王洪华和我等四人便组织了一个哲学学习小组，开始了有计划地学习。
    要学习毛主席的著作
    我们开始学习的是艾思奇著的“辩证唯物主义讲课提纲”，花了半年多时间，学到了一些哲学入门的知识，也学到了书里引证的不少毛主席的话，但因不知道毛主席在原著上是怎样解释的，这就引起了我们直接读毛主席著作的念头。由于我从没读过毛主席的书，还不敢肯定自己能不能读懂。有一天晚上，我找了一本“实践论”，先读一遍试试，觉得比读“辩证唯物主义讲课提纲”中引证的话领会的全面些，也深了一些。尽管有些问题还弄不通，甚至有个别字还不认识，但总觉得比读别的书有兴趣，越琢磨就越觉得毛主席的话非常对。第二天，我就把读毛主席著作的想法说给乔淑华、王洪华了，他们听了很高兴，原来他们也有这种想法。这样，我们几个人便开始学习毛主席的哲学著作了。
    毛主席的著作是深入浅出、亲切易懂的，但要理解和掌握它的精神实质，非得踏踏实实、刻苦钻研、下苦功不可。我在刚开始读毛主席著作时，就没认清这一点。读书不认真思考，只是挑一些成语和有趣的话死记硬背。像“你要知道梨子的滋味，你就得变革梨子，亲口吃一吃”，“失败者成功之母”，“吃一堑长一智”等等，虽然记住了，但连大意都没弄懂。后来，我改变了这种读书方法，细读细钻，读一遍不行，就读两遍，两遍不行，三遍、四遍；看一大段不行，就看一小段。并且一面读，一面联系实际进行思考、比较、分析、研究，这才对毛主席著作理解得深了一些。比如，当我读“实践论”时，读到“人们要想得到工作的胜利即得到预想的结果，一定要使自己的思想合于客观外界的规律性，如果不合，就会在实践中失败”的道理时，就联想到我们过去由于没有调查研究，凭“想当然”进货而造成积压的事，正说明了自己的思想没有符合客观外界的规律性，犯了主观主义的毛病。要做好售货员工作，就必须使主观认识正确的反映客观规律。
    不断学习不断实践
    学习毛主席著作，就是为了用毛泽东思想武器，改造自己的主观世界，正确地认识客观世界，做好售货员的工作。例如我过去认为有的售货员和顾客吵嘴，是一个巴掌拍不响，有些顾客就是“难侍候”，故意跟售货员找麻烦。经过学习“矛盾论”根据内因与外因，主要矛盾和矛盾的主要方面的原理，进行了分析，这才明白了顾客和售货员吵嘴的主要原因在售货员这方面，因为没有一个顾客故意来商店找售货员吵嘴，惹气生；而售货员和顾客吵嘴，主要是因为服务态度不够热情和工作不得法造成的。1958年下半年，我们商店掀起了学“天桥”的竞赛热潮，服务态度有了大转变，售货员和顾客吵架的现象也就没有了。我想：这下子算找到了解决售货员跟顾客之间矛盾的办法。可是不久，又有些顾客反映：现在到商店热乎到挺热乎，但没钱可别去，售货员那个热情劲，使你没法离开柜台。当时商店党支部领导我们找原因，我开始有点想不通：售货员的服务态度不热情、不主动，顾客反映像个“橛子”；热情、主动，又说“太热乎了”。到底怎么办好呢？真有点弄糊涂了。这时，我就向毛主席著作请教，找理论根据，研究自己想不通的问题。毛主席说，世界上没有无矛盾的事物，没有矛盾就没有世界；旧的矛盾解决了，新的矛盾又产生了。经过反复的琢磨，才使我明确了服务态度转变后出现的矛盾，是随着旧的矛盾被克服，产生的新矛盾。新矛盾的产生说明我们售货员对顾客心理还缺乏全面认识，对矛盾缺乏具体分析。为了找到解决这个新矛盾的办法，根据毛主席对具体问题要进行具体分析的教导，我在工作中就注意了研究这个问题。经过观察、分析和研究，我认识到这主要是对顾客心理缺乏研究，不能根据不同的顾客，具体分析，分别对待。其实，在顾客之中有阶层之分，男女之分，老少之分，还有爱好、性格之分。他们的生活环境和工作环境也各不相同。这就必须通过我们售货员的考察、分析，根据顾客的外貌、视线、语言来判断各种不同的顾客的特点。不管是来商店参观的、买东西的，还是先选而后再来买货的，我们都要根据他们各自不同目的给予不同的接待。对到商店来参观的顾客，要把他所想要看的某种商品给他看，并根据他们所想要知道的那种商品的某一特点（价格性能等等）做重点的介绍，让顾客对商品有认识，使他们有一种心情舒畅的感觉，这就避免了不分顾客来商店的目的，一股劲劝人家买货，弄得一些参观的顾客不好意思，对售货员有意见。在实际工作中的观察和分析，还使我体会到售货员的语言接待对顾客起很大的作用。因为语言是表达思想的工具，对于同一事物，人们的思想感情不同，说话时，语气感情也就不同，比如一位老大娘来买布，问：“同志，这布多少钱一尺？”“五角”！“啧啧！这个丧门神！”老大娘不满意的走了。这是因为那位售货员同志正在闹轻商思想，认为售货员工作低人一等，他根本没有好情感答对顾客，气冲冲的像要和人吵架。但是，一个全心全意为人民服务的售货员，他们的每句话，都应当充满为人民服务的思想，要作到诚恳、亲切。当然，也有一些人由于缺乏语言艺术的锻炼，不善于表达自己的思想感情，把好话说成坏话或说的不中听，像有的人接待顾客时说：“同志，你买这双鞋吗？”就惹得顾客说：“不买还不许看吗？”在照顾顾客试鞋号时说：“同志，你穿这鞋大小合适吗？”顾客就怀疑售货员找他的便宜，若说：“同志，你穿这鞋尺码合适吗？”顾客就没有反感了，通过这些实践，使我深切感到要当一个好售货员，必须树立全心全意为人民服务的思想，学习毛泽东思想，改进工作方法，使自己的主观愿望（服务态度好）和客观实际（顾客需要、心理）统一起来。
    经过对毛主席的世界观、方法论的学习，使我认识到，作一个好的售货员，仅有一个好的服务态度是不够的，还必须有强烈地为政治、为生产、为消费者服务的观点。我们在工作中常遇到这样的情形：一个工人，为了买到一双合意的鞋，一件衣服，三番五次往商店跑。这样，对顾客不便利，也有碍生产。怎么解决这个矛盾呢？不同的矛盾需要不同的解决方法。我想如果能把货送到工地、工厂，不是能既便利了顾客，又节省人力、提高生产吗？党支部支持我的看法。从这以后，我们常常不避风雨，不畏严寒，把商品送到工厂、工地、车间，做到“随用随到，哪用哪到”，甚至“夜间送货”。改变了“守门待客”和“守门待货”、有啥卖啥的思想。许多工人表扬我们说：“新社会售货员风格高，我们一定学习你们那种宁肯自己千辛万苦，不让他人为难的精神。”
    勤写常讲不断提高
    经过一个阶段的反复学习，反复实践，自己感到有很大收获，但到底有些啥收获，一下子很难说出来。我想，学习文化，到一个阶段就要考试，检验成绩，作工作到一定阶段要总结吸取经验教训，那么学理论的收获用什么办法总结提高呢，经过小组集体讨论，大家决定采用写读书心得笔记的办法，总结理论学习的收获。自己心里很高兴，但又怕写不好，因为自己从没动笔写过文章，连一封信都写不好；可是又一想，写笔记是为了提高学习质量，写总比不写强，写不好也没啥。当我拿出第一篇学习心得稿子到小组讨论时，大家都说我是“抄书先生”，我就又花了好几天时间，写了第二遍，经小组讨论，又说理论和实际分家了。回头又写，这次是这样写的：有一天接待一位四十多岁买凉鞋的女顾客，我根据具体对象要具体分析的方法，向她推荐浅灰色的凉鞋。我以为她能满意，可是她偏要买一双红色的凉鞋，我觉得奇怪。我没帮助她挑选，她不高兴的走了。后来才知道她是给女儿买鞋。我很后悔……这是经验主义。在讨论时，有的说挺好，有的又说是原则加例子。经过几次反复讨论，我心理有点不相信自己能写成文章。这时党支部书记在小组会上对大家说：“你们过去都没有写过东西，头两次写不好是难免的，不要灰心泄气。写心得笔记是检验学习成绩的好办法，大家不都说收获很大吗？有收获就能写成。”听了这番话，心里觉得开窍，当时想：虽然几次都未写成，但却逼着自己多读了不少书，想了不少问题。在写作上也有些提高。就这样又鼓起勇气，前后经过两个多月，写了十多次，这篇笔记才算被小组承认下来。后来，这篇笔记在“学理论”杂志编辑部的指导下，经过修改补充，以“售货员应有的风格”为题发表了。经过几个月的理论学习，和坚持写读书笔记的方法，学习的信心和劲头越来越足了，收获也越来越大了。实践使自己认识到：写读书心得笔记，不仅是锻炼自己写作能力的一种方法，而更重要是加深了对理论的理解，更好地用理论观点分析研究实际问题。每写一篇心得笔记，都要反复几次钻研理论文章，搜集、分析、研究许多实际问题。最后把自己感受最深的东西写成笔记。两年来，我一直坚持了这个方法，共写了五十多篇读书笔记和文章，在报刊上发表了二十多篇。
    由于大跃进形势的推动，使我们学习小组的同志们的思想更加开阔了。我们想工业、农业都在搞科学研究，难道商业工作、售货员工作就没有科学研究题目吗？可是研究什么呢？一时搞不清楚。有一天我们小组看“寻爱记”电影，大家议论纷纷，认为这个电影歪曲了人民售货员的形象，有人主张就研究售货员工作，写个剧本和它唱对台戏。在党支部领导下，经过小组先后几次讨论，确定研究“售货员的共产主义风格”、“售货员的语言艺术”、“售货员的服务态度”等九个题目。我分担了“售货员的共产主义风格”、“售货员要有学问”、“售货员的语言艺术”三个问题。为了研究“售货员的语言艺术”我学习了斯大林的马克思主义与语言学问题”和“苏联售货员”“谈谈商品”等书，还利用串班、假日时间到各商店访问、观摩，偶有所得就记下来。经过这样不断学习和研究，用半年的时间，初步写完了我分担的题目，又经全组同志讨论、修改，终于写出来了。经过这次理论研究工作的实践，使我更加认清了理论联系实际的重要性，更加清楚地认识到用理论研究业务或者写文章，都是学好理论的重要方法。这种方法，帮助我加深了对理论的理解，督促我多读了不少书，初步摸到了售货员的工作规律。现在，我们小组研究的九个题目都已经完成，并编成了“售货员的共产主义风格”一书，已由黑龙江省人民出版社出版了。
    一年多来，我做了六十余次讲演。在这么多次的讲演中，使我深切地体会到，这也是一种很好的学习。因为要想使别人听懂自己的讲演，就必须自己首先学好。每一次讲演都要督促自己多读些书，像“矛盾论”、“实践论”和“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”这些书，几乎在每次准备讲稿时，都要翻看几遍。在准备讲稿的过程中，从确定讲题、组织材料，到写讲稿，都是联系实际反复钻研理论的学习过程。特别是由于每次听讲的对象不同，要使自己的讲演作到有的放矢，自己就得多了解情况，这对丰富自己的感性知识，锻炼自己的思考能力，更好地学习理论、运用理论是很有益处的。组织一篇讲稿要比写一篇心得笔记艰苦得多，所得收获也大得多。例如，我在准备“树立巩固的无产阶级世界观”的讲稿时，除了反复阅读毛主席的著作以外，还看了红旗杂志和其它有关文章十余篇，花了四个晚上的时间，写出了讲稿。经学习小组讨论后，大家认为，讲稿中对两种世界观的概念讲的不透，特别是对资产阶级观点分析、批判得不够深。于是我就从多方面搜集了有关对待群众运动的资产阶级观点，又翻阅了毛主席的“湖南农民运动考察报告”的有关部分和“做无产阶级革命家”的小册子。进一步使我认识了要不要革命的群众运动是我们党进行革命和建设的一个根本性的问题，也是区别资产阶级革命家和无产阶级革命家的重要标志。为了更好地从每次讲演中取得经验，受到教育，提高自己，在每次讲演后，我都认真听取听众提出的问题，使自己受到教益。向别人作理论讲演，既是宣传马克思列宁主义，又是督促和鞭策自己学习的良好方法。
    两年来，在党的亲切教导与培养下，在同志们的热心帮助下，使我从毛主席的著作中吸取了智慧和力量，为党为人民作了我应该做的一点点工作。我向党保证：永远听毛主席的话，学习毛主席的著作，当毛主席的好学生，做一个又红又专的人民售货员。
