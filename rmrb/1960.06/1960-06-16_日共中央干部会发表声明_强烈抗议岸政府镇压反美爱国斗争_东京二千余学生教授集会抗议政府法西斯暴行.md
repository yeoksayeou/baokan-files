Xinhua News Agency, June 15th, Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese Communist Party Central Committee Cadre Meeting issued a statement on the 14th, strongly protesting the Kishida Nobusuke group's illegal suppression of the Japanese people's struggle against Eisenhower's "visit" to Japan.

The statement said that, as is well known, the purpose of Eisenhower's visit to Japan was to promote the forced approval of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," to stabilize the rule of Japan's traitorous and reactionary forces, and to piece together a military alliance of Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and the Philippines.

The statement condemned the Kishida Nobusuke government for attempting to declare martial law in practice and for mobilizing 25,000 police officers to suppress the masses on the day of Eisenhower's arrival. The statement said that the Japanese government's actions were a violent trampling on the rights enjoyed by the Japanese people under the Constitution.

The statement condemned the Kishida Nobusuke group's tyrannical suppression of the Japanese people who participated in the patriotic and just actions protesting Hagerty's visit to Japan. The statement said that the Japanese police's attacks on the Japan Iron and Steel Workers' Union and student self-government associations were illegal and unreasonable. The statement also said that the police's disregard for the protests of university school authorities, breaking into Tokyo University of Education to search, beat students, and journalists was the most heinous traitorous fascist atrocity.

The statement expressed that it would never allow the Kishida Nobusuke group's unbridled trampling of university autonomy.

The statement demanded that the Kishida Nobusuke government immediately cease its suppression of the people, release all those arrested, and cancel all deployments aimed at suppressing the people's struggle.

Xinhua News Agency, June 15th, Tokyo dispatch: Professors and students from Hosei University and Tokyo University of Education held separate rallies today to protest the Kishida Nobusuke government's police authorities' unreasonable search of their universities on the night of the 13th and the suppression of students participating in anti-American patriotic demonstrations against U.S. President's Press Secretary Hagerty.

　　At Hosei University, forty professors, including President Hiromi Arisawa, and approximately three hundred students participated in the rally. At this school's first joint teacher-student protest rally against the government, a resolution protesting the government's suppression of students was unanimously adopted. After the meeting, all participants, led by a group of professors, held a demonstration towards the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department. Arisawa Hiromi and several professors and students met with the Superintendent-General of the Metropolitan Police Department and lodged a strong protest.

　　At Tokyo University of Education, approximately fifty professors and two thousand students held a similar rally. The meeting passed a resolution opposing police suppression and opposing the ratification of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," demanding the resignation of the Kishida Nobusuke cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet. After the meeting, ten representatives of professors, students, and staff went to the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department to protest the police's barbaric suppression.

    新华社15日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会干部会14日发表声明，强烈抗议岸信介集团非法镇压日本人民反对艾森豪威尔“访问”日本的斗争。
    声明说，众所周知，艾森豪威尔访问日本的目的在于促使强行批准新日美“安全条约”，稳住日本卖国反动势力的统治，拼凑日本、南朝鲜、台湾和菲律宾军事同盟。
    声明谴责岸信介政府在实际上企图宣布戒严法，在艾森豪威尔到达的那天动员二万五千名警察镇压群众的行动。声明说，日本政府这样做，是强暴地践踏日本人民依据宪法所享有的权利。

    声明表示绝不容许岸信介集团肆无忌惮地蹂躏大学自治的暴行。
    声明要求岸信介政府立即制止对人民的镇压，释放所有被逮捕的人，并取消一切旨在镇压人民斗争的一切部署。
    新华社15日讯　东京消息：日本法政大学和东京教育大学的教授和学生今天分别举行大会，抗议岸信介政府的警察当局在13日夜间无理搜查他们的大学，镇压参加反对美国总统新闻秘书哈格蒂的反美爱国示威的学生。
    在法政大学，包括校长有泽广巳在内的四十位教授和大约三百名学生参加了大会。在这个学校第一次师生联合举行的反对政府的抗议大会上，一致通过了抗议政府镇压学生的决议。会后，所有参加大会的人，由一批教授带头，向东京警视厅举行了示威。有泽广巳和几位教授以及学生会见了警视厅总监，向他提出强硬的抗议。
    在东京教育大学，大约五十位教授和二千名学生举行了同样的大会。大会通过决议，反对警察镇压行动和反对批准新日美“安全条约”，要求岸信介内阁总辞职和解散国会。大会结束后，教授、学生和职员的十名代表到东京警视厅，抗议警察的蛮横镇压。
