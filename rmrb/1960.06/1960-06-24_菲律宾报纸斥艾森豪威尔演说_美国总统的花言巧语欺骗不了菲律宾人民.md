Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd, Manila: A columnist for the "Manila Chronicle," in criticizing Eisenhower's absurd speech to the Philippine Congress on the 18th, called on Filipinos not to be deceived by Eisenhower's hypocritical words. He pointed out that Eisenhower's guarantees of respecting Philippine sovereignty and treating Filipinos as sovereign partners were "worthless" until they were realized.

The columnist said, "We must never forget that he (Eisenhower) is the head of a country with its own needs and interests, and therefore, he is morally and legally obliged to defend these needs and interests, and sacrifice the interests of any other country."

The columnist also said that Eisenhower's remarks in the Philippine Congress denigrating Philippine nationalism would be seen as the most violent attack on Asia.

"It is to be expected that Eisenhower is uneasy about nationalism in underdeveloped countries like the Philippines."

The columnist said, "We should put our own interests first," and "under no circumstances should we act to please others."

A columnist for the "Philippine Herald" commented on the 16th, condemning the American conspiracy to arm the Philippines with modern weapons and use it as a military base for launching wars of aggression. The commentary pointed out that Filipinos, like the Japanese people and other Asian peoples, do not want such a war.

    菲律宾报纸斥艾森豪威尔演说
    美国总统的花言巧语欺骗不了菲律宾人民
    新华社22日讯　马尼拉消息：“马尼拉纪事报”专栏作家在18日抨击艾森豪威尔在菲律宾国会发表的荒唐演说时，要求菲律宾人不要受艾森豪威尔的伪善言辞的欺骗。他指出，艾森豪威尔关于尊重菲律宾的主权和要把菲律宾人作为拥有主权的伙伴来对待的保证在没有实现之前“是毫无价值的”。
    这位专栏作家说，“我们时刻不能忘记，他（艾森豪威尔）是有着自己的需要和利益的一个国家的首脑，因此，他在道义上和法律上不得不维护这些需要和利益，并且牺牲任何其它国家的利益”。
    这位专栏作家还说，艾森豪威尔在菲律宾国会讲话时诋毁菲律宾的民族主义的言论，将被认为是对亚洲的最猛烈的攻击。
  “艾森豪威尔对像菲律宾这样的不发达国家的民族主义感到不安，这是在意料之中的。”
    这位专栏作家说，“我们应该以我们自己的利益为重”，“在任何情况下我们都不能为了讨别人的喜欢行事”。
    “菲律宾先驱报”专栏作家在16日发表评论说，谴责美国阴谋用现代武器武装菲律宾，把它作为一个发动侵略战争的军事据点。评论指出，菲律宾人像日本人民和其它亚洲国家人民一样，不要这种战争。
