Deepen the Education Revolution and Carry Out Teaching Reform
Representative of Zunhua First Middle School, Hebei Province, Li Zhentang

    Established a Production Base with the Spirit of "Poor Stick"
    Since 1958, under the victorious encouragement of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune movement, and under the correct leadership of Party committees at all levels, our school has resolutely implemented the Party's educational policy and extensively and deeply carried out the education revolution centered on the integration of education and productive labor. In our school in this remote mountainous area, it was not without difficulties to start factories and farms on a large scale, but we were not intimidated by difficulties. We relied closely on the leadership of the Party, relied on the strength of the masses, set high ambitions, and with a spirit of continuous revolution, repeatedly and deeply carried out the struggle between the two roads and two ideologies. Through airing views, debates, and criticisms, we criticized various bourgeois ideas such as the opposition派, the "wait-and-see" 派, the "bean-counting" 派, and the theory of "only conditions matter," resisted the unhealthy tendencies that once appeared, and developed a communist style of daring to think and act. With the spirit of "poor stick" running the commune, we overcame various difficulties, from scratch to something, from small to large, from indigenous to modern, and established a production base with a certain scale and solidity. Currently, our school's production base includes three major systems: industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry. In terms of industry, in addition to a small chemical plant and a grain processing plant with a monthly output of 10,000 catties, there is also a machinery factory including seven workshops for mold making, sand casting, metalworking, fitting, forging, welding, and assembly; the metalworking workshop alone has thirteen machine tools of various types, realizing electrification and semi-automation. The farm has fifty-eight mu of land, including thirty mu for field crops, twenty mu for vegetables, and eight mu for forestry, with seven thousand poplar and willow trees and two hundred and four fruit trees. The livestock and poultry breeding farm covers twenty mu, with one hundred and thirty-three rooms. It raises three thousand two hundred and ten pigs, one hundred and forty-one sheep, six dairy cows, seven mules and horses, and nine hundred and seventy-seven various chickens and Beijing ducks. Along with the establishment and development of the production base, our school has gradually improved its organizational leadership and established a set of management systems. Productive labor is under the unified leadership of the school's Party branch, with the principal in charge; there is a production management office, managed by a deputy director of teaching affairs; five teachers serve as technical instructors, sharing the guidance work of each factory or workshop; teachers of all subjects participate in various productions according to the nature of the subjects they teach, working half a day each week. Students take turns participating in labor for one day each week, and grade-level divisions are implemented according to the content of their courses and taking into account their age, gender, and physical conditions. First-year junior high school students manage vegetables in conjunction with their botany lessons. Second-year junior high school students manage livestock and poultry in conjunction with their zoology lessons. Third-year junior high school students manage field crops and fruit tree cultivation on the basis of having learned the content of the botany course and having experience in vegetable management; physically strong students also do some grain processing. High school students participate in industrial production in combination with the study of mathematics, physics, chemistry and other courses; strong boys participate in forging and other labor, while girls and weak boys participate in fitting, sand casting, chemical industry and other labor. Agriculture is managed by class division, animal husbandry is divided into professional management, and industry is managed by factory or workshop; the production projects in which students participate are generally fixed with designated personnel; students working on a production project each day are formed into a group, and six groups each week are formed into a large group, which is convenient for leadership and also convenient for students to systematically learn and study technology. However, after a certain period of time, students' production projects are also appropriately adjusted to take care of the breadth of students' mastery of production technology and cultivate versatile talents. In addition, a succession system and a labor appraisal system have been established, and regulations for machine tool maintenance and safe operation procedures have been formulated to ensure that all production is carried out in a planned and orderly manner. In this way, the education revolution has been continuously deepened and developed in our school.

    Cultivate New People and Support Production
    Our school has established a production base to realize the integration of education and productive labor, and the quality of education has undergone significant changes and improvements compared to the past. First of all, the communist consciousness of teachers and students has been greatly improved. The vast majority of students have a correct understanding and actively support the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes; they also enthusiastically respond to the Party's various policies and calls. Through labor training and contact with workers and peasants, students have cultivated labor habits, established labor viewpoints, and changed their views of working people. For example, students were initially reluctant to call technical workers "masters"; after being infected by the workers' sincerity, enthusiasm, seriousness, and simplicity, they made close friends with the workers, and female students even automatically washed clothes and mended socks for the workers on Sundays. Students' sense of organization and discipline has also been strengthened, and public-mindedness, selflessness, unity, friendship, and returning lost property have become common practices; in 1959 alone, there were four hundred and fifty-nine good deeds. Now, a climax of studying Chairman Mao's works is rapidly developing among all teachers and students, which marks a new upsurge in Marxist-Leninist ideological education.
    Secondly, through labor practice, students have enriched their perceptual knowledge, learned and applied book knowledge thoroughly and flexibly, students' writing content has become richer, their ability to express themselves has been enhanced, and in particular, they can consolidate their mastery of the theoretical knowledge of physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, and other subjects and apply it to production practice. All students have learned a set of production technologies: junior high school students have generally learned a complete set of production technologies for various crops from planting to harvesting and knowledge of livestock and poultry breeding management. Three hundred and fifty-nine high school students have learned skills such as sand casting, casting, turning, and fitting, and one hundred and twelve people have basically reached the technical level of third to sixth grade workers; among them, third and fourth grade workers account for 70%, and fifth and sixth grade workers account for 23%. More notably, many high school students have also learned some modern production knowledge that exceeds the content of current teaching materials. Students in the drafting group, under the guidance of teachers, studied the basic specifications of drafting, geometric drafting, projection drafting, and the relevant parts of mechanical drafting; they learned to draw ellipses using the concentric circle method and the parallelogram method, as well as the drawing methods of ovals, hyperbolas, parabolas, Archimedean spirals, involutes of circles, and helixes; a total of one hundred and fifty people learned drafting and can view drawings, accounting for 41% of the total number of high school students. They also preliminarily mastered the knowledge related to drafting in analytic geometry, projective geometry, and approximate calculation. Since the metalworking workshop uses three-phase induction motors, many students have mastered the principle of the rotating magnetic field generated by three-phase motors, the delta connection and star connection of circuits, and can perform operations proficiently; semi-automatic lathes have been added to the metalworking workshop, and fourteen students now understand the structural principles and master the operating techniques.
    Thirdly, students' physical fitness has been significantly enhanced, and the incidence of diseases has been greatly reduced; common diseases in the past (such as neurasthenia and indigestion) and serious diseases (such as hepatitis and tuberculosis) have disappeared. Students have good eyesight, and only one out of more than one thousand and one hundred students in the school wears glasses. Last year, none of the graduates from two high school classes were unable to enroll in higher education institutions due to physical disqualification. At the county sports meeting this year's "May Day", all six groups of junior high school, high school, teachers, male and female, won the championship and won the first place in total score, receiving the "Sports Satellite" unit award flag from the county sports commission. In short, the education revolution centered on the integration of education and productive labor has made students new people who have both socialist consciousness and culture, and who are capable of both mental and physical labor.
    The in-depth development of the education revolution has not only cultivated all-round developed new people, but also created a large amount of wealth for the country and powerfully supported local industrial and agricultural production. Under the direct leadership of the county party committee, our school's industrial, agricultural, animal husbandry and other production has been closely linked to local production tasks. The scope of support and collaboration includes seven communes in this county, ten directly affiliated units in this county, ten factories in this county and other places, and thirteen brother schools. In the past two years, the machinery factory has manufactured five lathes, two drilling machines, one planer, eight universal bench vises, thirty-three steel mills, and five sets of eight-hole hot-air furnaces, and one hundred and seventeen tons of various machine parts to support local industrial construction. In order to support the fight against drought, in the past, it manufactured more than one hundred kinds of well water pump parts and various drainage and irrigation machine parts, totaling more than twenty-three tons. At present, county factories are producing drainage and irrigation machinery for drought resistance production, and our school is also undertaking the task of diesel engine oil pumps and fifty low-pressure steam water vehicles that county factories cannot yet manufacture. In order to support the tasks of spring plowing and autumn plowing, more than seven thousand nine hundred and ninety 坌铧 and tractor plows have been produced. In order to support water conservancy, five thousand small iron rails were cast for the reservoir construction site, reducing the physical labor of transportation for reservoir construction. According to the county party committee's instructions to support the communes' and commercial bureaus' industries, we also accepted orders from communes, commercial bureaus, transportation teams and other units for fifteen lathes, one hundred horse-drawn trains, ten water pumps, five thousand ploughs and fifty weeding machines. In the "double innovation" movement, two hundred sets of vehicles needed for the county's horse-drawn train mechanization have been completed. Recently, we have assisted ten directly affiliated units of the county to achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization. For example, a paper cutter was manufactured for the printing plant, and a hoist was manufactured for the construction company; in particular, the manufacture of the spinning rod machine enabled the hand-spinning of the county's woodworking factory to be mechanized, increasing work efficiency eighty times. In order to support the great development of animal husbandry, our school's pigs have achieved self-breeding and self-raising, with three hundred and twenty-eight pigs bred and three hundred and sixty fattened pigs in the past year; not only is the meat self-sufficient, but one hundred and ninety-eight have been sold to the state. In the past year, more than three hundred excellent piglets, more than thirty sheep, and one hundred and thirty excellent breeding poultry have been promoted to various communes in Beijing, Tangshan, and this county. In addition, more than six million catties of fertilizer have been provided to seven units in Chengguan Commune.
    Our school actively spreads various advanced agricultural production experiences and has played the role of an agricultural technology promotion station. In 1958, the farm created the experience of a bumper harvest of 900 catties of lint cotton per mu; when the county party committee held an agricultural exhibition, it organized cadres from various communes to conduct on-site visits and promoted it throughout the county. In December 1959, Tangshan City held an on-site meeting on "Ten Raisings" to promote our school's "Ten Raisings" experience centered on pig raising. In the past year or so, our school has promoted two hundred and eighty catties of nine kinds of fine seeds such as cotton and corn to local and foreign countries, and introduced six copies of high-yield experience materials. Teachers and students have also been sent to fourteen factories, rural areas, brother schools, etc. to introduce and teach various technologies for more than thirty person-times. Three students, Ma Guizhi, etc., introduced the school's cotton high-yield experience to the Erlizhuang production team, and managed it together with the members during the holidays, and the cotton seedlings were strong and knotted with many peaches, which attracted the members' visits and studies. Student Gao Shuzhen cured the diseases of a dozen pigs in her village, and the masses called her "Little Veterinarian". Students Zhang Guiyou, Zhao Ruixiang and other students from the fitter workshop went to Jianming Commune and Baozidian Commune to install and repair steel mills one after another, so that their grain processing plants were successfully put into production. This year, in the drought-resistant wheat irrigation campaign, students in the fitter workshop helped Xiaoche and other villages install and repair waterwheels, and imparted technology, contributing to the fight against drought and the capture of summer harvest.
    In addition to working in the school's production base, students also go to the countryside to work and participate in social welfare labor. In the past year, a total of eight thousand and forty agricultural labor days have been supported, including irrigating more than one thousand mu of wheat, opening one hundred and ninety-two meters of canals, planting more than seven thousand trees, repairing more than two hundred and ten meters of roads, and digging more than three thousand cubic meters of earth. From this, the teachers and students have established a communist labor attitude that does not count on remuneration, and have won the praise of the broad masses.

    Reform Teaching and Continuously Leap Forward
    Our school began to establish a production base, and attached importance to the issue of combining teaching with productive labor; under the leadership of the Party, it gradually deepened the education revolution into the teaching field. This is an inevitable trend. Our school's preliminary approach to reforming teaching is:
    First, boldly innovate courses and teaching materials and appropriately raise the level. The colorful socialist life has opened up a broad world for the all-round development of young students. They often participate in productive labor and social political activities, which greatly enriches their perceptual knowledge and greatly enhances their understanding. The current teaching materials can no longer meet their desire for knowledge. Therefore, it is imperative to reform courses and teaching materials and appropriately raise the level.
    1. Add production technology courses. Since the second half of 1959, our school has opened production technology courses in each grade; one class per week, conducted before labor. Junior high schools study production knowledge of agriculture and animal husbandry, and high schools study production knowledge of industry (mainly content such as metalworking, fitting, sand casting, casting, and drafting). A method of combining leadership, teachers, and students was adopted to formulate a teaching outline and teaching materials for industrial technology courses; high school students are required to reach the level of equivalent third to fourth-grade technicians upon graduation. In teaching, both theory and technology are taught. For example, when teachers explain the heat treatment of tool steel, they have referred to the teaching material content of metallurgy experiments in universities and colleges, and added the basic principles and technical knowledge of "in the quenching, annealing, and tempering of carbon steel, the structure of the steel changes due to different temperatures, thereby changing the mechanical properties of the steel", so that fitters can complete tasks well when manufacturing tools such as chisels, dies, taps, and vise jaws.
    2. Appropriately add new content to the current teaching materials. In the past, the junior high school chemistry teaching material explained the chemical properties of alkalis, acids, and salts, and students could only memorize the articles by rote and could not apply them in practice; the reason is that the teaching material did not explain the conditions for "alkalis and acids", "alkalis and salts", and "acids and salts" to undergo double decomposition reactions and the conditions for "metals and acids" and "metals and salts" to undergo displacement reactions; now, the relevant content in the high school chemistry teaching material is supplemented, and students can master it very well. Putting the "principle of ionization theory" in the high school chemistry teaching material into the "electrolysis of water" chapter in Chapter 5 of the junior high school chemistry teaching material can dispel students' doubts about the release of oxygen at the positive electrode and the release of hydrogen at the negative electrode. In the high school physics teaching material "casting", students have mastered the casting principle because they often work in the sand casting workshop, so there is no need to talk about it again; according to the needs, the main reasons for the formation of defective products in casting and methods to improve quality, as well as new content of casting technology, have been added. There is little content on material mechanics in the high school physics teaching material, and the production of the machinery factory urgently needs knowledge in this area; therefore, the deformation of solids, elongation, compression, shear, torsion, and bending in the elastic body in the physics textbook of universities and colleges have been added. In the "general properties of metals" chapter of the high school chemistry teaching material, in the "oxidation-reduction reaction" section, referring to the content of general chemistry in universities and colleges, according to the oxidation-reduction reaction theory based on the concept of electrons, the method of balancing the chemical formula of oxidation-reduction reaction is supplemented. There is no three-phase electricity content in the high school physics teaching material, and we have also supplemented it in the industrial technology course. It is convenient for students to solve practical problems in production after learning this new knowledge.
    3. Conduct mathematical system reform experiments. Due to the staleness, backwardness, repetition, and complexity of the contents of current secondary school mathematics teaching materials, they have long been unable to meet the production requirements of school electrification and semi-automation. After studying the speeches of Comrade Lu Dingyi and Minister Yang Xiufeng at the Second Session of the Second National People's Congress, our school teachers immediately launched a teaching reform movement. Now, one class in the second grade is used as a pilot to break the old system of mathematics course teaching materials, recompile mathematics teaching materials, and start teaching experiments. Set up elementary functions (including logarithms, complex numbers, high-order equations in the current high school algebra, solving triangles in trigonometry, inverse trigonometric functions), analytic geometry, calculus, probability theory and mathematical statistics, and drawing and approximate calculation methods (because students have mastered drawing and viewing drawing knowledge in production, and because the current class hours are limited, they are temporarily combined with the basic knowledge of industrial technology); the high school algebra, solid geometry, and trigonometry (algebra, trigonometry content is incorporated into elementary functions; solid geometry is canceled, of which "straight lines and planes" is incorporated into the drawing class, and the quadrature part is incorporated into calculus) and other courses are canceled. The specific arrangements are as follows:
    Second semester of the second year of high school: elementary functions three classes per week, calculus three classes per week.
    First semester of the third year of high school: analytic geometry (including plane and spatial parts) four classes per week, calculus two classes per week.
    Second semester of the third year of high school: calculus four classes per week, probability theory and mathematical statistics two classes per week.
    Students are required to master the basic knowledge of modern mathematics in order to prepare them for future engagement in modern industrial and agricultural production and further study in universities and colleges. After more than a year, the mathematics knowledge level of the second-year students at graduation is equivalent to the level of the first year of the current engineering university.
    Classes have been taught according to the new plan for two weeks, and the enthusiasm of teachers and students is very high; because students have rich practical production knowledge, they can easily understand and accept higher mathematics. For example, although students have learned the concept of functions, due to the limitations of the current teaching material, the concept of functions is understood as the one-to-one correspondence between the value of the independent variable and the value of the function. When the teacher explained the concept of functions in calculus, he used the amount of tool infeed when the semi-automatic lathe in the metalworking workshop was working as an example to inspire students to consciously correct their past one-sided understanding. For example, the continuous definition of non-monotonic variables is more difficult to accept, and the teacher used a bullhead planer with images to teach, and the students quickly understood its objective reality. The elementary functions of the second year of high school can complete the teaching task in only twenty-five class hours on the basis of past mathematics, achieving the purpose of commanding all the learned trigonometric and algebraic knowledge with functions as the guiding principle. At present, students can accept the new knowledge of elementary functions and calculus well, and 95% of the students in the class can complete the homework independently, and there are very few errors. Students are very interested in learning higher mathematics and have the confidence and determination to learn these two newly established courses well.

    Second, improve teaching methods accordingly and learn theoretical knowledge well. Teaching can overcome dogmatism and formalism only when it is closely linked to reality; engaging in productive labor on a large scale provides many favorable conditions in this regard.
    1. Formulate teaching plans based on teaching material content and in combination with production practice. In addition to organizing teachers to seriously study the scientific, systematic, and ideological nature of the teaching material, we also pay great attention to guiding teachers to collaborate, study the combination of teaching and productive labor, explore the factors in the teaching material that combine with production, and include them in the teaching plan. For example, in the teaching plan for the "trigonometric functions of acute angles" chapter of the geometry class, it is clearly proposed to combine the measurement methods of the angle of the air inlet of the iron melting furnace in the machinery factory and the dovetail angle of the self-made eight-foot lathe guide rail. The teacher of the botany class, combined with the fact that "when transplanting cabbage, removing some of the leaves to ensure survival", compiled a lesson plan on "transpiration of leaves". In this way, students find it easy to understand when they listen. Within a year, 881 classes in the teaching plans of mathematics, physics, chemistry, and other subjects were combined with production practice; of which 214 lessons in the high school plane geometry class had 152 lessons combined with production, accounting for 71% of the total number of lessons in the book.
    2. Use production examples and appropriately conduct on-site teaching to break through difficulties and explain key points thoroughly. In the classroom, in the past, when teachers taught the "combination of uniform linear motion at angles to each other" in the first grade physics class, students doubted the parallelogram law of motion synthesis; now, in connection with the movement of the lathe tool on the lathe, students quickly understand it. When teaching "hybridization" in the biology class, the teacher used the example of the new breed of Xinjiang fine-wool sheep cultivated by the school to teach, and the students understood the scientific knowledge deeply and specifically. Teachers sometimes also adopt on-site teaching methods, which makes it easy to thoroughly explain the key points of the teaching material. For example, when explaining electric motors in the workshop, first let the students observe the overall shape of the electric motor, then carefully observe its internal structure, then the teacher explains the principle and performs an operation demonstration, and finally the teacher summarizes; so that the students combine static observation and dynamic operation, combine perceptual knowledge and theoretical knowledge, and master knowledge deeply and save time.
    3. Use production equipment, organize "product summaries", and strengthen systematic review. For example, the use of lathes involves a lot of knowledge of mechanics in the first grade physics class, and the teacher reviews the relativity of motion and rest, the meaning and characteristics of translation and rotation, the synthesis and decomposition of motion and force, work, power and mechanical efficiency, transmission methods and principles, various frictions and their role in technology, etc. by analyzing and studying the partial structure and use methods of the lathe. This review method is fast, impressive, and also enables students to understand the structure and principles of production equipment.
    At the same time, "product summaries" were also organized in a planned manner. A product summary is a practical technical document written by teachers and students participating in production based on the operation of the entire production process and the book knowledge used. Through product summaries, students' knowledge can also be verified, consolidated and expanded, and students' ability to think independently and apply knowledge comprehensively can be cultivated, and a study style of linking theory with practice can be established. In the past year, fourteen "product summaries" have been made, including wheat, multi-spike sorghum, cotton, corn, lathes, planers, drilling machines, and furnaces.
    Although our work has achieved the above preliminary achievements, it cannot keep up with the development of the situation and cannot meet the requirements of the Party and the country for us. Therefore, we must raise the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, the red flag of the General Line, and the banner of the education policy even higher and forge ahead bravely. (Attached photo)

    深入 教育革命　进行教学改革
    河北省遵化第一中学代表　李振唐
    以“穷棒子”精神建立了生产基地
    从1958年以来，我校在总路线、大跃进、人民公社运动的胜利鼓舞下，在各级党委的正确领导下，坚决贯彻执行了党的教育方针，广泛深入地开展了以教育与生产劳动相结合为中心的教育大革命。在我们这个偏僻山区的学校里，开始大办工厂农场不是没有困难的，但是我们并没有为困难所吓倒。我们紧紧依靠党的领导，依靠群众力量，树雄心立大志，以不断革命精神，反复深入地开展了两条道路两种思想的斗争，通过鸣放辩论，批判了反对派、观潮派、算账派、唯条件论等形形色色的资产阶级思想，顶住了曾一度出现的歪风邪气，发扬了敢想敢干的共产主义风格，以穷棒子办社的精神，克服了各种困难，从无到有，由小到大，由土到洋，建立了具有一定规模而又巩固的生产基地。目前，我校的生产基地包括工业、农业、畜牧业三大体系：工业方面，除有一座小型化工厂和一座月产万斤的粮食加工厂外，还有一座包括制模、翻砂、金工、钳工、锻工、焊接、装配七个车间的机械厂；仅金工车间已有各种机床十三台，实现了电气化和半自动化。农场有土地五十八亩，其中大田作物三十亩，蔬菜二十亩，林区八亩，有杨柳树七千棵，果树二百零四棵。家畜家禽繁殖场占地二十亩，房舍一百三十三间。饲养着猪三千二百一十头，羊一百四十一只，奶牛六头，骡马等七头，各种鸡和北京鸭九百七十七只。伴随着生产基地的建立和发展，我校逐步健全了组织领导和建立了一套管理制度。生产劳动工作是在学校党支部统一领导下，由校长负责；设有生产管理处，由一名副教导主任兼管；教师五人兼任技术指导，分担各厂或车间的辅导工作；各科教师都根据所教的学科性质，分别参加各种生产，每周劳动半天。学生每周轮流参加劳动一天，是根据其所学的课程内容并照顾其年龄、性别、身体条件等实行了年级分工。初中一年级学生结合植物课的学习，管理蔬菜。初中二年级学生结合动物课的学习管理家畜家禽。初中三年级学生在已学过植物课内容和已有管理蔬菜经验的基础上，管理大田作物和果树栽培；身体强壮的学生，还兼做一些粮食加工。高中学生结合数学、物理、化学等课的学习，全部参加工业生产，身体强壮的男生参加锻工等劳动，女生和体弱的男生参加钳工、翻砂、化工等劳动。农业以班为单位划区管理，畜牧业分为专业管理，工业以厂或车间管理；学生参加的生产项目，一般是定人定职的固定下来；每天把在一个生产项目劳动的学生编成一个小组，每周的六个小组编成一个大组，便于领导也便于学生系统的学习和钻研技术。但经过一定时间后，还适当调换学生的生产项目，以照顾学生掌握生产技术的广度而培养多面手。此外，还建立了接班制度、劳动鉴定制度，制定了车床保养规程、操作安全规程等，保证各项生产有计划有秩序的进行。这样一来，教育大革命在我校就得到了不断深入和发展。
    培养新人　支援生产
    我校建立生产基地，实现教育与生产劳动相结合，教育质量比过去有了显著的改变和提高。首先，师生的共产主义觉悟大大提高。绝大多数学生对党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社认识正确，积极拥护；对党的各项政策、各种号召，也都热烈响应。通过劳动锻炼，通过和工农群众的接触，培养了学生的劳动习惯，树立了劳动观点，改变了对劳动人民的看法。如学生开始学技术，不愿意叫技术工人师傅；当受到工人的诚恳热情、认真朴实的感染后，就和工人交知心朋友，女学生还在星期天自动为工人洗衣裳、补袜子。学生的组织性纪律性也更为加强，大公无私、舍己为人，团结友爱、拾金不昧已成风气；只在1959年就出现好人好事四百五十九起。现在，一个学习毛主席著作的高潮正在全体师生中迅速的开展，这标志着马列主义思想教育的新高涨。
    其次，学生通过劳动实践，丰富了感性知识，学透学活了书本知识，学生写作内容丰富，表达能力增强，尤其能巩固地掌握理化、生物、数学等科的理论知识，并能应用于生产实践中。所有学生都学习了一套生产技术：初中学生一般都学会了各种作物从种到收的一整套生产技术和家畜家禽的饲养管理知识。高中学生三百五十九人都分别学会了翻砂、铸造、旋工、钳工等技术，并有一百一十二人基本上达到三至六级工的技术水平；其中三、四级工占70％，五级、六级工占23％。更突出的是不少高中学生还学习了一些超过现行教材内容的现代生产知识。制图组的学生在教师辅导下，学习了制图中的基本规格、几何制图、投影制图、机械制图的有关部分；学会了用同心圆法、平行四边形法画椭圆形，以及卵形、双曲线、抛物线、阿基米得螺线、圆的渐伸线、螺旋线的画法；学会制图的和能视图的共一百五十人，占高中学生总数的41％。他们还初步掌握了解析几何、投影几何、近似计算中的与制图有关的知识。由于金工车间使用三相感应电动机，许多学生已经掌握了三相电动机旋转磁场产生的原理、电路的三角形接法和星形接法，并能熟悉地进行操作；金工车间添设了半自动化车床，现已有十四名学生懂得构造原理和掌握操作技术。
    再次，学生的体质显著增强，发病率大大降低；过去常见的疾病（如神经衰弱、消化不良）和严重的疾病（如肝炎、肺结核等）已经绝迹。学生的视力良好，全校一千一百多名学生只有一人戴眼镜。去年两班高中毕业生没有因身体不合格而不能升学的。今年“五一节”全县运动会上，我校初中、高中、教师，男女共六组都获得冠军，获得总分第一名，得到县体委“体育卫星”单位奖旗。总之，以教育与生产劳动相结合为中心的教育革命，已使学生成为既有社会主义觉悟又有文化、既能脑力劳动又能体力劳动的新人。
    教育大革命的深入开展，不仅培养了全面发展的新人，而且还为国家创造了大量财富，有力地支援了当地工农业生产。我校的工业、农业、畜牧业等生产，在县委的直接领导下，已和当地的生产任务紧密结合着。支援和协作的范围，有本县的七个公社、本县的十个直属单位、本县和外地的十个工厂以及十三个兄弟学校。两年来，机械厂为支援地方工业建设，曾制造了车床五台，钻床二台，刨床一台，万能台钳八个，钢磨三十三台，八孔暖风熔炉五套，各种机器零件一百一十七吨。为了支援抗旱斗争，过去曾制造了机井水泵零件和各种排灌机械零件达一百多种，二十三吨之多。目前县各工厂正为抗旱生产排灌机械，我校还担负了县工厂还不能制造的柴油机油泵和五十台低压蒸汽水车的任务。为支援春耕和秋翻地的任务，曾制出了坌铧和拖拉机铧七千九百多块。为支援水利化，为水库工地铸造了小铁轨五千根，减轻了修水库的运输体力劳动。根据县委支援公社工业、商业办工业的指示，我们又接受了公社、商业局、运输队等单位的十五台旋床、一百辆马拉列车、十台水泵、五千块犁铧、五十台锄草机的订货。在“双革”运动中，已完成了全县马车列车化需要的车辆二百套。最近我们协助县的十个直属单位实现了机械化、半机械化。如为印刷厂制造了裁纸机，为建筑公司制造了卷扬机；特别是制成旋棒机后，使本县木器厂的手工旋棒实现了机械化，提高了工作效率八十倍。为支援畜牧业大发展，我校猪已达到自繁自养，一年多来繁殖的猪三百二十八口，育肥猪三百六十口；不仅肉食自给，还卖给国家一百九十八口。一年来向北京、唐山和本县各公社推广优良仔猪三百多口，羊三十多只，优种家禽一百三十只。此外，还支援城关公社七个单位肥料六百多万斤。
    我校积极传布各种农业生产先进经验，已起到了农业技术推广站的作用。1958年农场创造了棉花亩产皮棉九百斤的丰收经验；县委召开农业展览会时，组织各公社干部进行现场参观，在全县推广。1959年12月，唐山市召开“十大养”现场会，推广了我校以养猪为中心的“十大养”经验。一年多来，我校向当地和外地推广棉花、玉米等九种优良种籽二百八十斤，介绍了丰产经验材料六份。还曾派出师生到工厂、农村、兄弟学校等十四处介绍和传授各种技术达三十多人次。马桂芝等三个同学向二里庄生产队介绍了学校的棉花丰产经验，并在假期和社员一同管理，棉秧茁壮结桃多，引起社员们的参观和学习。高淑珍同学给本村十几口猪治好了病，群众称她为“小兽医先生”。钳工车间的张贵友、赵瑞祥等同学，先后到建明公社、堡子店公社安装和修理钢磨，使其粮食加工厂顺利投入生产。今年在抗旱浇麦运动中，钳工车间的同学帮助小河等村安装和修理水车，并传授了技术，为战胜旱魔、夺取夏季丰收贡献了一份力量。
    学生除在校内生产基地劳动外，还下乡劳动和参加社会公益劳动。一年来共支援农业劳动日八千零四十个，计浇麦一千多亩，开渠一百九十二米，植树七千多棵，修路二百一十多米，挖土三千多方。师生们从中树立了不计报酬的共产主义的劳动态度，获得广大群众的赞扬。
    改革教学　不断跃进
    我校开始建立生产基地，就重视了教学与生产劳动相结合问题；在党的领导下，还逐步把教育革命深入教学领域中来。这是一种必然的趋势。我校改革教学的初步做法是：
    第一、大胆革新课程、教材，适当提高程度。丰富多彩的社会主义生活，为青年学生的全面发展开辟了广阔的天地。他们经常参加生产劳动和社会政治活动，使他们的感性知识大大丰富了，理解力大大增强了，现行教材已不能满足他们的求知欲望。因此，改革课程、教材，适当提高程度，势在必行。
    一、增设生产技术课。从1959年下半年起，我校各年级都开设了生产技术课；每周一节，在劳动前进行。初中学习农业、畜牧业的生产知识，高中学习工业的生产知识（主要是金工、钳工、翻砂、铸造、制图等方面的内容）。采用领导、教师、学生三结合的办法制定了工业技术课的教学大纲和教材；要求高中学生毕业时，达到相当三至四级技术工人的水平。在教学中，既讲理论又学技术。比如，教师讲解工具钢的热处理时，曾参考了高等学校的金属学试验的教材内容，增讲了“在碳素钢的淬火，退火，回火处理中，由于温度不同，使钢的组织发生变化，从而改变钢的机械性能”的基本原理和技术知识，使钳工制造凿子、板牙、丝锥、虎钳口等工具时能很好完成任务。
    二、在现行教材中适当增加新的内容。过去初三化学教材讲碱、酸、盐的化学性质，学生只能死记条文，不能实际应用；原因是教材对“碱和酸”“碱和盐”“酸和盐”发生复分解反应的条件和“金属和酸”“金属和盐”发生置换反应的条件没有说明；现在把高一化学教材中的有关内容补充进去，学生都能很好掌握。把高二化学教材中的“电离学说的原理”下放到初中化学教材第五章的“水的电解”一章中，就能解除学生对正极放出氧、负极放出氢的疑问。在高中物理教材“铸造”中，由于学生经常在翻砂车间劳动已掌握了铸造原理，勿须再讲；就根据需要，增加了铸造形成废品的主要原因和提高质量的办法，以及铸造工艺的新内容。高中物理教材中关于材料力学的内容较少，而机械厂的生产又迫切需要这方面的知识；就补充了高等学校物理学教程中的弹性体力中的固体的形变、伸长、压缩、切变、扭转、弯曲等内容。在高中化学教材“金属的通性”一章的“氧化还原反应”一节中，参照高等学校普通化学的内容根据以电子观念为基础的氧化还原反应理论，补充了平衡氧化还原反应化学程式的方法。高中物理教材中没有三相电内容，我们工业技术课中也补充了。使学生学了这些新知识，才便于解决生产中的实际问题。
    三、进行数学体系的改革试验，由于现行中学数学教材内容的陈腐、落后、重复、繁琐，早已不能适应学校电气化、半自动化的生产要求了。我校教师们学习了陆定一同志和杨秀峰部长在人大二届二次会议上的发言后，立即掀起了教学改革运动。现以高二的一个班为试点，打破数学课程教材的旧体系，重编数学教材，开始进行教学试验。设置初等函数（包括现行高中代数中的对数、复数、高次方程三角中的解三角形、反三角函数）、解析几何、微积分、概率论和数理统计、及制图与近似计算法（制图与近似计算因学生在生产中已掌握制图，看图知识，又因目前课时所限，暂合并工业技术基础知识讲授）等课程；取消了高中代数、立体几何、三角（代数、三角内容并入初等函数；立体几何取消，其中“直线与平面”部分并入制图课求积部分并入微积分中）等课程。具体安排如下：
    高二下学期：初等函数每周三节，微积分每周三节。
    高三上学期：解析几何（包括平面和空间部分）每周四节，微积分每周二节。
    高三下学期：微积分每周四节，概率论与数理统计每周二节。
    要求学生掌握现代化数学基本知识，为使学生将来从事现代化工农业生产和升入高等学校深造作好准备。使高二学生经过一年多的时间，毕业时的数学知识程度相当于现在工科大学一年级水平。
    按新的计划已上课两周，师生积极性很高；由于学生有丰富的实际生产知识，容易理解和接受高等数学。例如，学生虽然学过函数概念，但由于现行教材的局限，把函数概念理解成自变量的值和函数值是一一对应的。教师在讲解微积分中的函数概念，就以金工车间半自动化车床工作时进刀量为例，启发学生自觉纠正了过去的片面理解。又如非单调变量的连续定义是较难接受的，教师就以牛头刨床，配合着图象来讲授，学生很快的理解了它的客观真实性。高二的初等函数，在过去的数学基础上，只用二十五课时，就能完成教学任务，达到以函数为纲统帅学过的三角、代数的全部知识的目的。目前学生对初等函数和微积分的新知识能很好的接受，全班四十个学生有95％能独立完成作业，并且错误很少。学生对学习高等数学感到很大兴趣，有信心和决心学好这两门新设课程。
    第二、相应地改进教学方法，学好理论知识。教学紧密联系实际，才能克服教条主义和形式主义倾向；大搞生产劳动，给这方面提供了许多有利条件。
    一、根据教材内容，结合生产实际，制定教学计划。我们除了组织教师认真研究教材的科学性、系统性、思想性而外，还十分注意引导教师协作，研究教学和生产劳动的结合问题，挖掘教材结合生产的因素，订入教学计划里。比如，几何课“锐角的三角函数”一章的教学计划内，就明确提出结合机械厂内熔铁炉进风口的角度和自制的八尺车床导轨的鸠尾角等的测定方法。植物课的教师，结合“移植白菜时，去掉一部分叶片，保证成活”的事实，编写了“叶的蒸腾作用”的教案。这样做，学生听起来就生动易懂了。一年内，在数学、物理、化学等学科的教学计划中，就有八百八十一节结合了生产实际；其中高中平面几何课的二百一十四节教材，就有一百五十二节结合了生产，占全书总节数的71％。
    二、利用生产实例和适当进行现场教学，突破难点，讲透重点。在课堂上，过去教师讲高一物理课“互成角度的匀速直线运动的结合”一节时，学生对运动合成的平行四边形法则怀疑；现在联系车床上车刀的运动，学生很快就理解了。在生物课上讲“杂交”，教师就以学校的新疆细毛羊育成新品种的实例进行教学，学生对科学知识理解得深刻具体。教师有时还采用了现场教学方法，很容易讲透教材重点。例如，到车间讲电动机，先让学生观察电动机的全形，进而详细观察它的内部构造，再由教师讲解原理，进行操作表演，最后教师总结；使学生把静的观察和动的操作结合起来，把感性知识和理论知识结合起来，掌握知识既深透又省时间。
    三、利用生产设备，组织“产品总结”，加强系统复习。比如，车床应用高一物理课的力学知识很多，教师通过分析研究车床的部分构造和使用方法，使学生复习了运动和静止的相对性，平动、转动的意义和特征，运动和力的合成与分解，功、功率和机械效率，传动的方法和原理，各种摩擦及其在技术中的作用等等。这种复习方法，进展快，印象深，还使学生理解了生产设备的构造和原理。
    同时，还有计划地组织了“产品总结”。产品总结是由参加生产的师生，根据整个生产过程的操作情况和所运用的书本知识，写成的理论联系实际的产品技术资料。通过产品总结，也可以印证、巩固与扩大学生所学知识，培养学生独立思考和综合应用知识的能力，树立理论联系实际的学风。一年来，曾做过小麦、多穗高粱、棉花、玉米、车床、刨床、钻床、熔炉等“产品总结”共十四份。
    我们的工作虽然取得以上初步成就，但赶不上形势的发展，达不到党和国家对我们的要求。因此我们一定要更高的举起毛泽东思想的红旗，总路线的红旗，教育方针的旗帜奋勇前进。（附图片）
