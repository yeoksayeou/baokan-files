    I Love My Work Even More
    Mu Chengkuan, Director of the Water Sports Department, Tianjin Institute of Physical Education
    The film "Spring and Autumn on the Water" has been released. This is China's first feature film reflecting the story of swimming in the nation's sports endeavors. Through the different experiences of Hua Zhenlong and his son Hua Xiaolong, it sharply contrasts the essence of the old and new societies; exposes the devastation of sports in the old society, praises the Party and Chairman Mao's care for sports, and the vigorous development of sports in New China; and also demonstrates the heroic miracles of Chinese swimmers who have achieved excellent results under the guidance of the Party.
    When I saw Hua Zhenlong participating in the International Swimming Competition and being detained in the mansion of Young Master Sun in the film, I was reminded of my own participation in the "International Swimming Competition." It was on the evening of August 23, 1941, that I competed against several foreigners. At that time, my participation in the competition was to win honor for the Chinese people. This thought inspired me to gather all my strength to swim. As soon as I entered the water, I surpassed them and reached the finish line before them. The conscientious Chinese people who were watching at the time were so excited and applauded vigorously for having gained some pride, just as shown in the film. However, after the competition, not only were the prizes not awarded, but those lackeys and slaves of imperialism also came to provoke fights.
    After Japan surrendered, I thought that this time, when the Chinese people themselves held sports events, it would not be like the last time. So I came from Tianjin to Beijing (then called Beiping) to participate in the swimming competition again. Who knew that this time I wasn't even able to participate in the competition before I was illegally detained by Kuomintang secret agents and locked up in a dark room. In the decades of the old society, I truly suffered all kinds of humiliation. I often thought: "In terms of money and power, I can't compare to you, but in terms of physical strength and real skills, you spoiled young masters are far behind! The bullying and intimidation of your reactionary ruling class cannot frighten me!" So at that time, I tried every possible way to participate in competitions, and each time I defeated them. The experiences of Hua Zhenlong in the old society, as reflected in the film, are a microcosm of thousands of sports workers who were devastated by the old society.
    Today, in the socialist New China, thanks to the Party and Chairman Mao's concern and emphasis on sports, sports activities have become a massive mass movement under the call to exercise, defend, and build the motherland. Sports workers are also treated with importance and warm care by the Party and the government, just like Hua Zhenlong after liberation as depicted in the film, fulfilling their long-cherished wish - to cultivate outstanding athletes for the motherland, to win glory for the motherland, and to contribute diligently to the sports cause of New China under the leadership of the Party.
    Take me, for example. Since the founding of New China, the Party and the people have given me great trust and honor. I gloriously hold the position of cultivating the new generation in sports education; and this time I was also invited to participate in the National Gathering of Heroes from the cultural and educational front. My son, Xiangxiong, broke the world record in the 100-meter breaststroke for the third time at the first National Games last year. This was my dream for decades, and today it has truly been realized in the younger generation. This is a happiness that can only be obtained under the cultivation of the Party and the superior socialist system. Looking back on the past and thinking about the present, I cannot help but love the socialist motherland even more, love my work even more, and thank the Party and Chairman Mao. I am constantly thinking: I can still work for the motherland for decades. I want to learn well from Hua Zhenlong's noble qualities of being wholeheartedly devoted to the country's sports cause, to popularize and improve people's sports, to cultivate more outstanding athletes like Hua Xiaolong who are resolute and brave, and to work even harder to win greater glory for the country!
    The film "Spring and Autumn on the Water" has also given me great inspiration: As a sports worker, we must be clear that we are to cultivate a sports team of the working class that is both red and expert. Therefore, we must first cultivate athletes with communist ideological consciousness and moral character, and at the same time strive to improve their technical level. We must go all out, study diligently, create boldly, and dare to innovate; be good at following the mass line, mobilize and organize the masses to participate in physical exercise, study diligently and practice hard, and work hard and cleverly to achieve excellent results, win greater glory for the motherland, and make sports better serve production and construction.

    我更加热爱我的工作
    天津体育学院水上系主任　穆成宽
    影片“水上春秋”上映了，这是我国第一部反映祖国体育事业中游泳运动的故事片。它通过华镇龙和华小龙父子俩的不同遭遇，把新旧社会的本质做了鲜明的对比；揭露了旧社会对体育事业的摧残，歌颂了党和毛主席对体育事业的关怀和新中国体育事业的蓬勃发展；同时也表现出了我国游泳运动员在党的教导下获得优异成绩的英雄奇迹。
    当我看到影片中华镇龙参加万国游泳比赛和被扣在孙大少公馆一节时，使我回忆起当年自己参加“万国游泳比赛”的情况。那是在1941年8月23日的一个傍晚，我同几个外国人比赛。当时我参加比赛就是要为中国人出口气。这一思想激发我鼓足了劲来游。一下水我就超过他们一头，比他们先到达终点。那时在场观看的有良心的中国人，都为出了一口气而兴奋得用力鼓掌，就像影片中所表现的那样。但是，比赛完了不但奖品不发，那些帝国主义的走狗奴才还来寻衅打架。
    日本投降以后，心想这回中国人自己办运动会就不会像上次那样了。所以我又由天津来到了北京（当时叫北平）来参加游泳比赛。谁知这次我连比赛都没参加上，就被国民党特务非法地扣了起来关在黑房子里。我在旧社会的几十年真是受尽了欺侮。我经常想：“论钱论势比不过你们，比身子骨，比真本事，你们这群少爷秧子差得远哩！你们反动统治阶级的欺侮和恫吓，吓不倒我！所以那时我想方设法参加比赛，每次我都战胜了他们。影片中反映的华镇龙在旧社会的遭遇，是千百个遭到旧社会摧残的体育工作者的一个缩影。
    今天，社会主义的新中国由于党和毛主席对体育事业的关怀和重视，体育运动在锻炼身体、保卫和建设祖国的号召下，已经成为规模巨大的群众运动。体育工作者也都和影片中所反映的华镇龙在解放后的情况一样，受到党和政府的重视和亲切关怀，实现了自己多年的宿愿——为祖国培养优秀的运动员，为祖国争光，在党的领导下，勤勤恳恳地为新中国体育事业贡献力量。
    拿我来说，新中国成立以来，党和人民给了我极大的信任和荣誉。我光荣地在体育教育岗位上担任着培养新的一代的工作；这次又被邀参加了全国文教战线的群英会。我的儿子祥雄在去年第一届全国运动会又第三次打破百米蛙泳世界纪录。这是我过去几十年的梦想，今天真个在他们青年一代的身上实现了。这只有在党的培养和优越的社会主义制度下才能获得的幸福。抚今思昔，不能不使我更加热爱社会主义的祖国，热爱自己的工作，感谢党和毛主席。我不时在想：我还可以为祖国工作几十年。我要很好地学习华镇龙忠心耿耿于祖国体育事业的高尚品质，为普及和提高人民体育运动，培养出更多的像华小龙那样的坚毅、勇敢的优秀运动员，为祖国争取更大的光荣而加倍努力工作！
    “水上春秋”这部影片也给了我很大的启示：作为一个体育工作者，必须明确，我们是要培养一支又红又专的工人阶级的体育队伍。因此，首先要培养运动员具有共产主义思想觉悟和道德品质，同时努力提高他们的技术水平。我们必须鼓足干劲，刻苦钻研，大胆创造，敢于革新；善于走群众路线，发动和组织群众参加体育锻炼，勤学苦练，苦干加巧干，才能取得优异成绩，为祖国争取更大光荣，使体育运动更好地为生产建设服务。
