Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 3rd: TASS reported from Moscow on June 3rd: Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev held a press conference in the Sverdlov Hall of the Kremlin on the 3rd. The Soviet Premier announced the Soviet Union's new proposals regarding the issue of complete and thorough disarmament.

The proposal, along with a letter from Nikita Khrushchev, has been sent to the heads of government of various countries.

The Soviet government's new proposal stipulates that, in the first stage of disarmament, all means of delivering nuclear weapons to their targets should be prohibited and destroyed without exception, and military bases on foreign territories should be removed simultaneously.

In this way, at the very beginning of the implementation of a broad disarmament plan, the danger of a sudden outbreak of nuclear war can be eliminated.

The new proposal also details regulations for the supervision of disarmament. It stipulates that an international supervisory organization should be established within the framework of the United Nations at the start of the first stage of disarmament.

Soviet Government's Proposal on Basic Provisions of a Treaty on Complete and Thorough Disarmament (Full Text)

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 3rd: TASS reported from Moscow on June 3rd: The full text of the Soviet government's proposal on the basic provisions of a treaty on complete and thorough disarmament is as follows:

On September 18, 1959, the Soviet government submitted a proposal for complete and thorough disarmament to the United Nations for discussion. The Soviet government put forward this proposal based on its firm belief that achieving complete disarmament in all countries and destroying all means of waging war is the most effective and, under the present conditions, the most realistic way to prevent a rocket-nuclear war that would be fatally harmful to all peoples and to ensure lasting world peace.

The current balance of power in the world makes it impossible for aggressors to launch a war against peaceful countries with impunity; modern weapons have unprecedented destructive power in human history, enough to quickly eliminate entire countries; it is now possible to deliver these weapons to any part of the earth almost instantaneously – all these factors make the idea of ​​relying on war as a means of resolving international disputes an obviously foolish act. The peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems, which the Soviet Union and other socialist countries have consistently advocated, is a reality. However, as long as the arms race continues, as long as countries possess the means of suddenly attacking other countries, and possess large quantities of weapons, including nuclear weapons, peaceful coexistence cannot be very consolidated, and peace cannot be considered reliably guaranteed.

Currently, truly unimaginable funds are being spent on armaments. It is enough to mention just one point: the value of some modern bombers is more expensive than gold equal to their own weight. It should be known that many types of weapons are obsolete and dismantled even before they leave the factory. The arms race has become a meaningless waste of human and material resources. Just taking a portion of the funds currently used by countries to manufacture and stockpile weapons would be enough to eliminate hunger around the world.

It is no longer permissible to allow the energy of hundreds of millions of people and the wealth they create to be used for war preparations. It is becoming increasingly clear that war preparations are intolerable. Modern humanity has made brilliant achievements in conquering nature and developing spiritual culture, and they should be entitled to a better destiny.

The great goal that people have dreamed of for generations – ending wars and fundamentally eliminating them from human society – has now become a realistic and achievable goal. This goal can be achieved by destroying all types of weapons and disbanding all the armies in the world, that is, through complete and thorough disarmament. This is the only truly reliable foundation on which a lasting and indestructible peace among nations can rely under current conditions.

Complete and thorough disarmament will not give any one side an advantage. This makes it possible to eliminate many obstacles caused by individual countries fearing that the implementation of partial measures for disarmament will disrupt the balance of power and endanger their security. Concluding an agreement on complete and thorough disarmament will greatly facilitate international supervision of disarmament measures: because if complete disarmament is achieved, countries will have no reason to hide anything from each other, and it will be possible to achieve thorough supervision.

The Soviet proposal for complete and thorough disarmament has been warmly endorsed by countries around the world. This proposal gives new strength to the desire of the people of all countries to forever get rid of the nightmarish threat of rocket-nuclear war. No government has opposed this proposal. The United Nations unanimously supports the idea of ​​complete and thorough disarmament and reaffirms that the issue of complete and thorough disarmament is the most important issue facing the world today. The United Nations General Assembly called on governments to make every effort to resolve this issue constructively as soon as possible. This appeal places a huge moral obligation on all countries.

In order to realize this call from the United Nations and the desire of the people of all countries for disarmament, the governments that primarily determine the achievement of international agreements on this issue must take concrete measures without delay to prepare and conclude such agreements.

The Soviet government is making every effort to achieve practical results as quickly as possible in disarmament negotiations – drafting and signing an agreement on complete and thorough disarmament.

As everyone knows, the Soviet Union's proposal on September 18, 1959 included a specific plan to achieve complete and thorough disarmament in three stages over a total period of four years. This refers to: in the first stage, greatly reducing the conventional armed forces and armaments of various countries under international supervision; in the second stage, disbanding the remaining armed forces and abolishing military bases on foreign territories; and in the third stage, destroying all types of nuclear and rocket weapons and implementing other measures to complete complete and thorough disarmament.

In proposing these gradual disarmament measures, the Soviet Union took into account the views of Western countries. In past disarmament talks, Western countries, citing the Soviet Union's advantage in armed forces and conventional forces, advocated moving measures on nuclear disarmament to the final stage. The Soviet government has always maintained that the use of weapons of mass destruction should be prevented from breaking out and believes that this measure should be implemented as soon as possible.

In recent months, during meetings and talks between national leaders, and during the meetings of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee, which was entrusted to formulate measures to implement the United Nations General Assembly resolution on complete and thorough disarmament, the views and suggestions of all parties on the issue of disarmament have been elaborated and clarified in detail.

The Soviet government consistently adheres to its proposal for complete and thorough disarmament, which is in line with the great goal of ensuring lasting world peace that is of concern to all peoples without exception. At the same time, the Soviet government is also prepared to consider any constructive considerations and wishes put forward by other participants in the negotiations that help to reach an agreement on the practical implementation of disarmament.

During the negotiations, some countries, such as France, have suggested that disarmament should begin with prohibiting and destroying the tools for delivering nuclear weapons, chemical weapons, and biological weapons to their targets, such as military rockets, military aircraft, and military ships, and that the need for countries to simultaneously remove their military bases occupied in other countries should be taken into account.

The Soviet government still believes, as before, that the procedures for implementing disarmament measures as stipulated in its proposal of September 18, 1959 are fully in line with the goal of practically achieving complete and thorough disarmament. However, in order to promote an agreement on this issue as soon as possible in order to ensure a lasting and unbreakable peace among nations, the Soviet government is once again prepared to accommodate Western countries and to reach an agreement on another procedure for implementing disarmament measures if this procedure is more acceptable to Western countries.

As a country that fervently advocates freeing humanity from the threat of rocket-nuclear war as soon as possible, the Soviet government proposes that an agreement be reached to begin the process of complete and thorough disarmament in the first stage by prohibiting and destroying, under international supervision, all means of delivering nuclear weapons to their targets and simultaneously removing military bases on foreign territories.

When combat rockets of various ranges, military aircraft, submarines and warships, artillery capable of firing nuclear warheads, and all other means of delivering weapons of mass destruction to their targets have been destroyed, and when countries no longer station armed forces and military installations outside their own borders, it will practically become impossible for one country to invade another with atomic and hydrogen weapons.

To this end, the Soviet Union expresses its willingness to start disarmament by destroying all means of delivering nuclear weapons to their targets, even though the Soviet Union possesses a recognized advantage in this most modern and effective means, namely intercontinental ballistic missiles.

In this case, in the next stage of the disarmament plan, namely the second stage, measures such as prohibiting nuclear weapons, biological weapons, and chemical weapons, destroying all stockpiles of such weapons, and stopping the reproduction of such weapons can be implemented, and the threat of nuclear war in any form will be eliminated forever. At the same time, the armed forces and conventional armaments of various countries must be substantially reduced.

The third stage is marked by the completion of complete and thorough disarmament, the disbandment of all armies, military departments, general staff, the abolition of conscription and military training for young people, and the complete cessation of expenditures for military purposes.

It is proposed that the entire disarmament plan be implemented on the basis of an international treaty within a certain period of time – four years or another mutually agreed period – under effective international supervision.

When international organizations discussed the issue of complete and thorough disarmament, they paid close attention to the issue of what measures should be taken to ensure peace and observe international legal systems in relations between countries in the event of complete and thorough disarmament. The Soviet government proposes that the contracting states should jointly and carefully study this issue and, in the process of implementing the third stage, that is, the final stage, take the necessary measures in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations to maintain peace under the conditions of complete and thorough disarmament, including: the obligation of each country to provide police (civilian police) forces for the use of the Security Council when necessary in order to guarantee the maintenance of peace. Of course, this police (civilian police) force can only be used to maintain peace among the people of all countries, and cannot be used to suppress the people of all countries striving for their independence and social progress, and cannot be used to interfere in the internal affairs of various countries.

All disarmament measures shall be implemented under strict international supervision from beginning to end. To this end, the contracting states should establish an international supervisory organization whose powers will extend to all disarmament measures taken and will expand as these measures become increasingly broad and far-reaching.

Based on the above, the Soviet government proposes a draft of the basic provisions of a treaty on complete and thorough disarmament.

Basic Provisions of the Treaty on Complete and Thorough Disarmament

The governments of the member states of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee established in 1959, following the resolution on "Complete and Thorough Disarmament" adopted by the 14th United Nations General Assembly on November 20, 1959, believe that it is necessary to immediately begin the practical task of resolving complete and thorough disarmament in order to free mankind from the threat of new wars and ensure lasting and unbreakable world peace. To this end, it is decided to formulate a treaty on complete and thorough disarmament. This treaty will include the following basic provisions.

Ⅰ. Complete and Thorough Disarmament stipulates:

-- Disband all armed forces of various countries and prohibit any form of restoration;

-- Prohibit and destroy all types of armaments and all stockpiles, and stop their production, including atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, chemical weapons, biological weapons, and other types of weapons of mass destruction:

-- Destroy all means used to deliver weapons of mass destruction to their targets;

-- Remove military bases of any type and withdraw and disband all foreign troops on the territory of any country;

-- Abolish all forms of conscription of citizens;

-- Stop military training for residents and close down all military schools;

-- Abolish all military departments, general staff, and their local organs, and abolish all other military and militarized organs and organizations;

-- Stop the allocation of funds for military purposes, whether through the state budget or through social organizations and individuals.

After the implementation of complete and thorough disarmament, countries will only have strictly limited police (civilian police) quotas agreed upon for each country. These forces will only be equipped with light weapons and will be tasked with maintaining domestic order and ensuring the personal safety of citizens.

Ⅱ. All countries shall implement complete and thorough disarmament within a negotiated, strictly limited period of time; at the same time, the process of disarmament will be gradually and sequentially implemented in three stages; it should be pointed out that no country, at any stage, will enjoy a military advantage over other countries due to disarmament.

A conference attended by all countries will be convened to discuss the issue of other countries participating in the agreement on complete and thorough disarmament.

Ⅲ. All disarmament measures will be carried out under strict and effective international supervision from beginning to end, namely:

(1) Immediately after the signing of the treaty, a preparatory committee will be established whose task is to implement the practical measures for establishing an international supervisory organization for complete and thorough disarmament.

(2) The supervisory organization shall be established within the framework of the United Nations when this treaty comes into effect. The supervisory organization will be composed of all contracting states, and representatives of the supervisory organization will hold regular meetings to discuss issues related to the implementation of effective supervision of disarmament. The meeting elects the supervisory committee, which is composed of permanent and non-permanent member states, and it establishes institutions in various places. The members of the supervisory committee include representatives of socialist countries, representatives of countries currently participating in Western military and political alliances, and representatives of neutral countries. Except in special cases, resolutions on substantive issues by the supervisory committee require a two-thirds vote to pass, and resolutions on procedural issues require only a simple majority vote to pass.

(3) The supervisory committee carries out the actual leadership of the supervisory system, formulates instructions, and promptly analyzes and organizes the reports received. Countries provide the supervisory committee with reports on their armed forces and equipment.

(4) The supervisory organization will deploy its personnel in all contracting states. These personnel are selected on an international basis, taking into account the principle of fair geographical distribution and in accordance with the provisions of the treaty. The supervisory organization dispatches its inspectors to the territories of various countries in order to be able to begin fulfilling its functions when countries begin to implement disarmament measures. The contracting states shall ensure that supervisors and inspection teams are able to reach any location within their territory where verifiable disarmament measures will be implemented promptly and without hindrance, or any area where on-site inspections of such measures will be conducted. The contracting states shall provide the supervisory organization with all necessary means of transport for this purpose for the passage of personnel of the supervisory organization within their territory, and the expenses shall be borne by the supervisory organization.

(5) The personnel of the supervisory organization shall enjoy within the territory of each contracting state all privileges and immunities necessary for the independent and unhindered supervision of the implementation of the disarmament treaty.

(6) All expenses of the international supervisory organization shall be provided by the contracting states. The standards for contributions from various countries shall be expressly stipulated in the treaty on complete and thorough disarmament.

The supervisory organization should have various full powers at each stage according to the scope and nature of the disarmament measures.

The basic disarmament measures that should be implemented in the three stages of the complete and thorough disarmament plan are stipulated as follows:

Third stage

1. The armed forces of various countries are completely disbanded. Countries only have strictly limited police (civilian police) with agreed upon quotas prescribed for each country. These personnel can only be equipped with light weapons, and their task is to maintain internal order and protect the personal safety of citizens.

2. Destroy various remaining conventional armaments and ammunition equipped by the armed forces and stored in armories, and military technical equipment should be eliminated or used for peaceful purposes.

After the complete and thorough disarmament plan is implemented, the supervisory organization remains and conducts regular supervision of the performance of obligations undertaken by various countries. The supervisory committee shall have the right to send mobile inspection teams to any location in the territory of any country to inspect any target.

Countries provide the supervisory organization with the following materials: the location of police (civilian police) personnel, the number of police in each location (area), and all transfers of large numbers of police (civilian police) near the border. The international inspection team conducts comprehensive supervision of whether the number of police (civilian police) and their armaments comply with the agreed upon quotas prescribed for various countries.

8. Enable other measures formulated to ensure compliance with the treaty on thorough disarmament to take effect.

9. Implement measures to maintain peace and security in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. When necessary, countries are obligated to provide teams from the police (civilian police) personnel remaining in various countries to the Security Council.

With the implementation of the disarmament plan and the reduction of military expenditures by various countries, a portion of the funds released as a result will be used for economic assistance to underdeveloped countries.

This is the Soviet Union's proposal for implementing the procedures for complete and thorough disarmament, taking into account the opinions of Western countries.

While presenting this proposal, the Soviet government expresses its willingness to prepare to reach an agreement on the implementation of disarmament on the basis of the current proposal (which is a development of the plan presented on September 18, 1959). The main issue lies in concluding an agreement and ultimately moving towards complete and thorough disarmament as expected by the people of all countries and called for by the United Nations. The Soviet government is prepared to do so without delay and without wasting time. It sincerely hopes that other countries will do the same and will fully realize the responsibility borne by all governments, especially the governments of major countries, for the cause of disarmament.

    赫鲁晓夫在克里姆林宫记者招待会上宣布
    苏联提出全面彻底裁军新建议
    主张在裁军的第一阶段就毫无例外地禁止和销毁一切把核武器送到目标的手段，并同时撤除在别国领土上的军事基地。详细拟定了有关裁军监督的规定。在第一阶段开始时，就要在联合国范围内成立国际监督组织。
    新华社4日讯　塔斯社莫斯科3日讯：苏联部长会议主席尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫3日在克里姆林宫斯维尔德洛夫大厅举行了记者招待会。苏联部长会议主席宣布了苏联关于全面彻底裁军问题的新建议。
    这个建议连同尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫的信件已经分别送给各国政府首脑。
    苏联政府的新建议规定在裁军的第一阶段就毫无例外地禁止和销毁一切把核武器送到目标的手段，并同时撤除在别国领土上的军事基地。
    这样，在执行广泛的裁军计划的最初期，便可以消除突然爆发核战争的危险。
    新建议还详细地拟定了有关裁军监督的规定。规定指出，在裁军第一阶段开始时，就要在联合国范围内成立国际监督组织。苏联政府关于全面彻底裁军条约基本条款的建议（全文）
    新华社4日讯　塔斯社莫斯科3日讯：苏联政府关于全面彻底裁军条约基本条款的建议，全文如下：
    苏联政府曾在1959年9月18日提请联合国讨论全面彻底裁军的建议。苏联政府提出这个建议的出发点是，坚信实现所有国家的彻底裁军、销毁进行战争的一切手段，是一个最有效的和在现今条件下最现实的方法，可以防止发生对各国人民有致命危害的火箭—核战争，保障世界持久和平。
    现在在世界上已形成的力量对比使侵略者不可能不受惩罚地发动反对和平国家的战争；现代化武器具有人类历史上空前的破坏力，足以迅速消灭整个整个的国家；现在有可能几乎在刹那间把这种武器送到地球上任何一处——所有这些因素使得指望拿战争作为解决国际争端的手段这种想法显然成为愚蠢的行动。苏联和其他社会主义国家一贯主张的不同社会制度国家的和平共处，是一个现实的事实。但是，只要继续进行军备竞赛，只要各国还拥有突然进攻它国的手段，拥有大量武器、其中包括核武器，那么和平共处就不可能十分巩固，和平就不能认为是得到了可靠的保证。
    现今，在军备方面花费着的确难以想像的资金。只要提出下列一点就够了：某些现代化的轰炸机的价值比等于它自身重量的黄金还要贵。要知道，还有这样的事：许多种类的武器甚至还没有出厂就已经过时而拆卸。军备竞赛变成了人力物力的无意义的消耗。只要拿出目前各国用于制造和储备武器的一部分资金，就足以消除世界各地的饥饿现象。
    再也不能容许把亿万人的精力和他们创造的财富用于备战，备战是不能容忍的事，这一点已经日益明显。现代人类在征服自然界和发展精神文化方面取得了辉煌成就，他们应当得到最好的命运。
    人们世世代代憧憬着结束战争、把战争根本从人类社会中消除掉，这一伟大目标现在已经成为现实的、可以达到的目标了。这个目标可以通过销毁各种类型的武器和解散世界一切军队来达到，即通过全面彻底裁军来达到。这就是在目前条件下各国间持久的、不可摧毁的和平所能够依靠的唯一真正可靠的基础。
    全面彻底裁军，不会使任何一方占优势。这就有可能消除由于只谈裁军的局部措施，个别国家担心这种措施的实现会破坏力量的对比和危害它们的安全而形成的许多障碍。缔结全面彻底裁军的协议，就可以大大便于对裁军措施实行国际监督：因为如果实现彻底裁军的话，各国就没有理由互相隐瞒什么，就将有可能实现彻底的监督。
    苏联关于全面彻底裁军的建议得到世界各国的热烈赞同。这个建议给各国人民希望永远摆脱火箭—核战争的梦魔般威胁的愿望以新的力量。没有任何一国政府反对这个建议。联合国一致支持全面彻底裁军的主张，并重申，全面彻底裁军问题是当前世界面临的最重要问题。联合国大会号召各国政府尽一切努力尽速建设性地解决这一问题，这一呼吁赋予一切国家一个巨大的道义义务。
    为了实现联合国的这一号召和实现各国人民要求裁军的愿望，必须使那些首先决定着就这个问题达成国际协议的政府毫不拖延地采取具体措施来准备和缔结这种协定。
    苏联政府尽一切努力争取能够在裁军谈判中尽可能快地取得实际结果——起草和签订全面彻底裁军协议。
    大家知道，苏联1959年9月18日的建议包括一个在总共四年的期限内分三个阶段实现全面彻底裁军的具体方案。这里指的是：第一阶段，在国际监督下大大裁减各国的常规武装部队和军备；第二阶段，解散剩下的武装部队并取消在别国领土上的军事基地；第三阶段销毁各种类型的核武器和火箭武器以及实现完成全面彻底裁军的其他措施。
    苏联在提出这些循序渐进的裁军措施时，考虑到了西方国家的观点。西方国家在过去就裁军进行会谈时，借口苏联在武装部队和常规部队方面占有优势，而主张把核裁军方面的措施移到最后一个阶段。苏联政府则一向主张应使运用大规模毁灭性武器的战争不能爆发，并认为这个措施越快实现越好。
    在最近几个月来国家领导人之间的会晤和会谈中，以及受委托制定的措施来实现联合国大会关于全面彻底裁军的决议的十国裁军委员会的会议期间，详细地阐述了和明确了各方关于裁军问题的观点和建议。
    苏联政府一贯坚持它的全面彻底裁军的建议，这个建议符合各国人民毫无例外都关心的保证世界持久和平的伟大目标，同时，苏联政府还准备考虑谈判的其他参加者所提出的有助于就实际实现裁军达成协议的任何建设性的考虑和愿望。
    在谈判过程中，某些国家，例如法国，曾提出这样的意见，即裁军应该从禁止和销毁把核武器、化学武器和生物武器送到目标的工具，例如军用火箭、军用飞机和军用船只等，并且考虑到各国同时撤除它们在别国领土上占有的军事基地的必要性。
    苏联政府仍同以前一样地认为，1959年9月18日它的建议中所规定的实现裁军措施的程序完全符合实际实现全面彻底裁军的目标。但是，为了用一切办法促使尽快地就这个问题达成协议以利于保证各国间持久的和牢不可破的和平，苏联政府再次准备迁就西方国家，而就实现裁军措施的另一个程序达成协议，如果这个程序更可以为西方国家所接受的话。
    作为一个热烈主张尽快地使人类摆脱发生火箭—核战争的威胁的国家，苏联政府建议达成下列协议：在第一阶段就在国际监督下禁止和销毁把核武器送到目标的一切手段，并同时撤除别国领土上的军事基地，以此作为全面彻底裁军过程的开始。
    当各种射程的战斗火箭、军用飞机、潜水艇和军舰、能够用核弹头来射击的大炮和其他一切把大规模毁灭性武器送到目标的手段都已经销毁的时候，而各国不再在本国国境以外驻扎武装部队和设有军用建筑物的时候，一国用原子武器和氢武器侵犯另一国的情况就将实际上成为不可能的了。
    为了这个目的，苏联表示愿意从销毁一切把核武器送到目标的手段来开始裁军，尽管苏联在这种最现代化、最有效的手段、即洲际弹道火箭方面拥有公认的优势。
    在这种情况下，在裁军计划的下一个阶段，即第二阶段，就可以实现这样一些措施，如禁止核武器、生物武器和化学武器，销毁这种武器的一切储备并停止再生产这类武器，无论何种形式的核战争威胁就会永远消除。同时还要大规模裁减各国的武装部队和常规军备。
    第三阶段的标志是完成全面彻底裁军，解散所有军队、各军事部、总参谋部，废除义务兵役制和对青年的军事训练，彻底停止用于军事目的的开支。
    建议在国际条约的基础上，在一定期间内——在四年或者在其他一致同意的期限内，在有效的国际监督下来实现整个裁军计划。
    在国际机构讨论全面彻底裁军问题时，都非常注意为在全面彻底裁军的情况下，在国与国的关系中保障和平并遵守国际法制而应该采取的措施问题。苏联政府建议，条约参加国要共同仔细地研究这个问题，在实现第三阶段、即最后阶段的过程中，根据联合国宪章采取必要措施在全面彻底裁军的条件下维护和平，其中包括：各国有义务在必要的情况下提供警察（民警）部队供安全理事会使用，以便保证维护和平。当然，这种警察（民警）部队只能用来维护各国人民间的和平，而不能用来镇压争取自己的独立和社会进步的各国人民，不能用来干涉各国的内政。
    裁军的一切措施自始至终都要在严格的国际监督下来实现。为此，条约参加国应该成立国际监督组织，这个组织的职权将扩及到所采取的一切裁军措施，并随着这些措施将具有越来越广泛和越来越深远的性质而扩大。
    根据以上所述，苏联政府提出全面彻底裁军条约基本条款的草案。
    全面彻底裁军条约的基本条款
    1959年成立的十国裁军委员会参加国政府，遵循着第十四届联合国大会于1959年11月20日通过的“关于全面彻底裁军”的决议，认为有必要立即着手实际解决全面彻底裁军的任务，以便使人类摆脱新战争的威胁和保障世界持久的和牢不可破的和平，为此，决定制定出关于全面彻底裁军的条约。这个条约将包括下列一些基本条款。
    Ⅰ，全面彻底的裁军规定：
    ——解散各国的全部武装部队并禁止任何形式的恢复；
    ——禁止和销毁一切类型的军备一切储备，并停止其生产，其中包括原子武器、氢武器、化学武器、生物武器和其他类型的大规模毁灭性武器：
    ——销毁一切用来把大规模毁灭性武器送到目标的手段；
    ——撤除任何类型的军事基地，撤出并解散在任何国家领土上的一切外国军队；
    ——取消公民的各种兵役义务；
    ——停止居民的军事训练，并封闭各种军事学校；
    ——取消各军事部、总参谋部及其地方机关，取消一切其他的军事和军事化的机关和组织；
    ——停止拨付用于军事目的的资金，不论是通过国家预算或者通过社会团体和个人的途径。
    在实现全面彻底裁军以后，各国将只拥有严格限定的、为每一个国家商定的警察（民警）名额，这种部队只配带轻武器，以维持国内秩序和保障公民个人安全为使命。
    Ⅱ，所有国家，应当在经过协商的、严格限定的期限内实现全面彻底裁军；同时，裁军的过程将逐步地、分三个阶段循序实现；应当指出，任何一个国家，在任何一个阶段中，都不会享有由于裁军产生的对其他国家的军事优势。
    为了讨论其他国家参加关于全面彻底裁军的协定的问题，将召开所有国家参加的会议。
    Ⅲ，所有裁军措施将自始至终地在严格的、有效的国际监督下进行，即：
    （1）签订条约以后，立即建立筹备委员会，其任务是实施建立全面彻底裁军国际监督组织的实际的措施。
    （2）监督组织应当在联合国范围内在本条约生效时建立。监督组织将由所有缔约国组成，监督组织的代表定期召开会议来讨论有关裁军有效监督的执行情况问题。会议推选出监督委员会，它由常任和非常任会员国组成，它在各个地方设立机构。监督委员会的成员有社会主义国家的代表、现在参加西方军事政治同盟的国家的代表以及中立国家的代表。除了特殊的保留情况以外，监督委员会对于实质问题的决议要有三分之二票才算通过，对于程序性问题的决议只要简单多数票就算通过。
    （3）监督委员会对监督系统进行实际的领导工作，制定指示，对于所收到的报告进行及时的分析和整理。各国向监督委员会提供关于自己的武装部队和装备的报告。
    （4）监督组织将在所有缔约国配置自己的人员，这些人员是在国际基础上考虑到公正的地理分布原则和根据条约各条款而选择的。监督组织在各国领土上所以派遣自己的检查人员，是为了在各国开始实施裁军措施时，能够着手履行自己的职能。缔约国应保证监督员和检查小组能及时地、无阻碍地到达本国境内将实施应受检验的裁军措施的任何地点，或是到达将对这种措施进行现场检查的任何地区。缔约国将为此目的的监督组织提供一切必需的交通工具，以供监督组织人员在它们境内通行，费用由监督组织负担。
    （5）监督组织人员在各缔约国境内将享有为独立地、无阻碍地实现对裁军条约执行情况进行监督所必需的各种特权和豁免权。
    （6）国际监督组织的一切开支由各缔约国提供。各国的缴费标准将在全面彻底裁军条约中明文规定。
    监督组织在每一个阶段上都应该根据裁军措施的范围和性质拥有各种全权。
    全面彻底裁军计划三个阶段上应实行的裁军基本措施规定如下：
    第一阶段
    1，从各国武装部队中取消、停止生产和撤销一切运送核武器的工具，其中包括：
    ——战略和战役—战术用途的火箭、各种类型的飞机导弹、能运送核武器的所有军用飞机；
    ——能用来作为核武器运送工具的水上军舰；
    ——各级和各种类型的潜水艇；
    ——各种炮兵以及其他能用来作为运送原子武器和氢武器的工具。
    2，一切外国军队从别国领土撤回本国境内。在军队撤出以后空出来的或者是后备的各种用途的外国军事基地和武器库都要销毁。
    3，从第一阶段一开始直到今后彻底销毁运送核武器的各种工具为止，禁止专门装置进入轨道或留在宇宙空间，禁止能运送大规模毁灭性武器的一切军舰驶出本国领水，禁止能运送大规模毁灭性武器的军用飞机飞越出本国领空。
    4，火箭的发射只为了和平目的以符合早先规定的互相同意的准则，同时要采取一致同意的检查措施，包括在现场检查这种火箭的发射台的配置情况。
    5，拥有核武器的国家有责任不把这种武器或生产这种武器所必需的资料转交给没有这种武器的国家。而没有核武器的国家应该保证不生产这种武器。
    6，各国相应地缩减用于军事目的的开支。
    7，在第一阶段实行下列监督措施：
    对销毁火箭武器、军用飞机、水上军舰、潜水艇以及其他可以被用来作为运送原子武器和氢武器的手段，建立现场的国际监督。
    把国际检查组派往设有军事基地的地方和外国军队在他国领土上驻扎的地方，以实现对撤除上述基地的监督，实现对把军事人员和军队撤回本国领土的监督，同时建立对机场和港口的监督，以保证不把这些机场和港口用于军事目的。同时在国际监督组织的监察下，撤销火箭发射场（发射用于和平目的的火箭的发射场除外）。
    监督组织将有权对以前曾经全部或部分从事生产火箭、飞机、水上军舰、潜水艇和一切其他运送核武器的手段的所有企业、工厂和造船厂进行不受阻碍的检查，以禁止组织能够作为原子武器和氢武器运送工具的军备的秘密生产。根据协议，可以对某些工厂和设备建立常设的监督组。
    监督组织派出的国际检查组将有权全面地检查用于和平目的的火箭装置，并在发射时亲临现场。
    监督员和监察委员会通过现有联络途径进行联系，并享有保证迅速地传送报告和命令的特权。
    8，在第一阶段将共同研究停止生产核武器、化学武器和生物武器和销毁这些类型的武器的储备的措施，这些措施应在第二阶段实现。
    9，第一阶段必须在一年到一年半的时间内结束。国际监督组织应总结第一阶段措施实施情况，以便向缔约国、安全理事会和联合国大会提出报告。
    第二阶段
    1，完全禁止核武器、化学武器、生物武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器，停止生产并销毁这些类型武器的一切储备。
    2，一切国家的武装力量缩减到规定的水平，其中美国和苏联的武装部队缩减到不超过一百七十万人的水平。所解除的常规武器和弹药必须销毁，而军事技术装备也必须销毁或者用于和平目的。各国的军费开支应相应地缩减。
    3，在第二阶段实行下列监督措施：
    监督组织的代表到当地去检查核武器、化学武器和生物武器的全部现有储备的销毁。监督组织将有权检查所有开采原子原料、生产或利用原子材料或原子能的企业。根据协议，可以对某些企业和设备建立常设的监督组。
    对解散军队和销毁军备，实行现场的国际监督。
    监督员的任务包括：对准确而按时地执行关于解散军队、取消和消灭常规军备的物质部分、军事技术装备和战斗储备品的决议进行监察；向监督委员会和驻在国政府提出报告。
    国际监督员小组的成员中，应该根据需要解散的部队的性质和应被销毁的军备的类型的不同而包括专家在内。
    监督组织可以不受阻碍地接触到关于各国用于军事目的的预算拨款的材料，其中包括各国立法机构和执行机构关于这个问题的一切决议。
    4，在第二阶段要共同研究应该在第三阶段实施的下列措施：
    （1）关于在实现了全面彻底裁军条约所规定的一切措施之后保证遵守这个条约的措施；
    （2）对于在全面彻底裁军的条件下根据联合国宪章维护和平与安全的措施。
    5，同从第一阶段向第二阶段过渡时一样，国际监督组织应总结第二阶段措施实施情况，以便向缔约国、安全理事会和联合国大会提出报告。
    第三阶段
    1，各国武装部队解散完毕。各国只剩有严格限制的、并经一致同意的、为每个国家规定的名额的警察（民警），这些人员只能装备轻武器，任务是维持内部秩序和保卫公民人身安全。
    2，销毁武装部队所配备的和武器库里储存的各种剩下的常规军备和弹药，军事技术装备则应该消灭或者用于和平目的。
    3，取消各工厂中的军备生产，其中包括停止常规军备生产，而在完成全面彻底裁军计划后各国剩下的警察（民警）所要用的轻武器的有严格限制的生产除外。
    4，撤销各军事部、总参谋部、一切军事的和军事化的机构和组织。停止任何后备兵员的征集。各国应根据自己的宪法程序通过法令，禁止对青年进行军事教育和取消各种形式的兵役。
    5，停止通过国家或通过私人和社会组织以任何形式为军事目的拨付资金。由于实行全面彻底裁军而腾出来的资金，用于缩减或完全取消居民的赋税，补助国民经济，给不发达国家提供经济和技术援助。
    6，在第三阶段实行下列进一步的监督措施：
    国际监督组织派监督员到当地去检查撤销各种军事部、总参谋部、各种军事和军事化的机构和组织的工作，检查停止军事训练和其他一切军事活动的工作。
    对停止拨付用于军事目的的资金一事建立监督。
    监督组织在必要时可以建立空中监察和在各国领土上进行空中摄影的制度。
    7，全面彻底裁军计划实现后，监督组织仍然保留，并对各国履行它们所承担的义务的情况进行经常的监督。监督委员会将有权派遣流动检查组到各国领土上任何地点对任何一个目标进行检查。
    各国向监督组织提供下列材料：警察（民警）人员分布地点、每一地点（地区）的警察人数以及在国境附近大批警察（民警）的一切调动情况。国际检查组对警察（民警）的人数和它的武装是否符合一致同意的为各国规定的定额进行全面监督。
    8，使为保证遵守彻底裁军条约而制定的其他措施生效。
    9，根据联合国宪章实行维护和平和安全的措施。在必要时，各国有义务从各国余下来的警察（民警）人员中提供队伍给安全理事会。
    随着裁军计划的实行和各国军费开支的缩减，由于这样而腾出来的资金的一部分，将用于为对不发达国家的经济援助。
    这就是苏联考虑到西方国家的意见而提出来的实现全面彻底裁军程序的建议。
    苏联政府在提出这个建议的同时，表示愿意准备在目前的建议（它是1959年9月18日提出的计划的发展）的基础上就实现裁军达成协议。主要问题在于缔结一项协定并最终能走向各国人民所期望的和联合国所呼吁的全面彻底裁军。苏联政府准备毫不拖延地、不浪费时间地这样做，它真诚地希望其他国家也能这样做，也能充分意识到所有国家政府，特别是大国政府对于裁军事业所承担的责任。
