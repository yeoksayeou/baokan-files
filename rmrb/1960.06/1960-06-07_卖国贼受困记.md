The Ordeal of a Traitor (Lyrics)
	Yi Heyuan

	Red flags flutter over the streets of Tokyo,
	A sea of people surges with wrathful tides.
	Two hundred thousand arms are raised high,
	Two hundred thousand hearts beat as one,
	Shouting "Down with the American lackey, Nobusuke Kishi!"
	Shouting: "Get out, American imperialists!"
	One shouts: "Abolish the US-Japan Security Treaty!"
	Another cries: "American military bases must be withdrawn!"
	Here they shout: "Oppose Eisenhower's visit to Japan!"
	There they cry: "Don't deal with wolves!"
	Slogans follow one after another,
	Shaking the earth and mountains!
	The crowd includes representatives from all walks of life,
	Workers, peasants, merchants, students, truly all-encompassing.
	Look at that old professor, full of fervor,
	The silver beard on his chest fluttering in the wind.
	Look, even housewives have come,
	The children in their arms wave their hands.
	Look, even peasant representatives have arrived,
	Banners made of straw mats are held high!
	The demonstration marches forward mightily,
	The Diet Building is the goal.

	The strength of the mass demonstration need not be described,
	Let us look at the embarrassing situation of Nobusuke Kishi.
	This day was May 26th,
	Just as the clock struck eleven in the morning,
	This traitor was trembling with anxiety, truly distressed,
	Unable to stand, unable to sit, head hot and ears burning.
	Slogans like sharp arrows shot through the wind,
	The storm of people's struggle raged like fire!
	He pondered: What is to be done?
	Where can a rat running across the street hide or escape?
	Someone said the Diet Building is the most reliable,
	Hiding there, no one will know.
	Nobusuke Kishi got in the car and sped away,
	Five thousand policemen as bodyguards.
	Once inside the building, his heart still pounded,
	Sweat dripped like rain.
	As soon as he entered, he tightly closed the door,
	Every window was shut tight.
	His secretary called his home to report:
	The Prime Minister has safely entered the Diet Building, don't worry.
	It was too early to mention the word "safe,"
	Nobusuke Kishi's anxiety was truly unbearable.
	From outside the window came shouts,
	Slogans that shook the sky:
	"Down with the Nobusuke Kishi government!"
	"Punish the traitors, never forgive!"
	The more he listened, the more frightened and annoyed he became,
	Afraid that it was more bad than good, and he would lose his life!
	The weather was hot and stuffy with little wind,
	He tightly closed the windows, not daring to open them even a bit.
	Sitting silently to the side, his expression was bad,
	His attendants anxiously watched him.
	At this time, there was not a soul in the Diet corridors,
	Like a large, quiet tomb.
	A terrible silence enveloped everything,
	Every minute and every second was unbearable.
	Suddenly, the clock struck four,
	Nobusuke Kishi sighed and said:
	"There's nothing to do here,
	Alas, I want to go out, but I can't." ...
	The Diet Building is surrounded,
	The demonstrators are watching closely.
	If you try to sneak out of that door,
	The masses will swarm there!
	Until 10:30 at night,
	Nobusuke Kishi hurriedly escaped through the back door.
	A large number of police escorted him,
	The car sped away.
	Although this lackey returned home,
	His heart was still pounding! ...

	This is a section of the story of Nobusuke Kishi's ordeal;
	It shows that the Japanese people are admirable and have high fighting spirit!

    卖国贼受困记（唱词）
    易和元
    东京街头红旗飘，
    人山人海涌怒潮。
    二十万只手臂高高举，
    二十万人心一条，
    高呼打倒美国走狗岸信介，
    高呼：滚开，美国佬！
    这个喊：“废除日美安全条约”，
    那个叫：“美军基地要撤消”！
    这里喊：“反对艾森豪威尔访
    问日本”，
    那里叫：“不和豺狼打交道”。
    口号一个接一个，
    直叫得地动又山摇！
    人群里各行各业有代表，
    工农商学真个是无所不包。
    你看那老教授慷慨激昂，
    胸前银须随风飘。
    你看那家庭主妇也来了，
    怀中的孩子在把手招。
    你看那农民代表也赶到，
    草席做的旗帜举得高！
    示威队伍浩浩荡荡往前走，
    国会大厦是目标。
    群众示威的声势且不表，
    再把岸信介的狼狈相瞧一瞧。
    这一天是五月二十六号，
    上午十一点刚把钟敲，
    这卖国贼胆战心惊真苦恼，
    站不是坐不是头热耳烧。
    一声声口号像利箭随风射到，
    人民斗争的风暴如火如潮。
    他左思右想：这如何是好？
    过街老鼠哪里躲来哪里逃？
    有人说国会大厦最可靠，
    躲在那里人不知来鬼不晓。
    岸信介坐上汽车就开跑，
    五千名警察作保镖。
    进了大厦心里还在蹦蹦跳，
    汗珠儿滴滴像雨浇。
    一进去就把大门紧紧来关好，
    一扇扇窗户都闭牢。
    他秘书给他家打电话汇报：
    首相平安进入大厦别心焦。
    平安二字未免提得早，
    岸信介提心吊胆实难熬。
    从窗外传来了一声声口号，
    一声声口号震云霄：
    “岸信介政府要打倒”！
    “惩办卖国贼决不恕饶”！
    这家伙越听越怕越烦恼，
    怕的是凶多吉少命难逃！
    这一天天气闷热风又少，
    他紧关窗户不敢打开半分毫。
    默坐一旁神色很不好，
    左右随从个个焦急把他瞧。
    这时候国会走廊没个人影，
    像一座大坟墓静静悄悄。
    可怕的沉寂在笼罩，
    一分一秒都难熬。
    猛然间时钟当当敲过四点，
    岸信介唉声叹气把话表：
    “留在这里没事做，
    哎，要想出去又办不到。”……
    国会大厦被包围，
    示威群众看得牢。
    想从那个门里溜出去，
    那里群众就涌来了！
    直到深夜十点半，
    岸信介才从后门仓皇往外逃。
    大队警察来护送，
    汽车嘟嘟如飞跑。
    这走狗虽然回家里去，
    心里还在怦怦跳！……
    这就是岸信介受困书一段；
    表明日本人民可钦可敬斗志高！
