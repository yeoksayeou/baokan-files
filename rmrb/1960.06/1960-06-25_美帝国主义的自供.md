American Imperialism's Confession

Editor's Note: American imperialism regards South Korea as an "outpost base" for promoting its aggressive policies and preparing for new wars in Asia, and has placed a huge bet on it. In 1950, it brazenly launched the war of aggression against Korea, but under the counterattack of the Korean and Chinese people, the aggressors suffered a shameful defeat.

Here are excerpts of some remarks made by American government heads and American warlords about Korea. From these remarks, it can be seen that although the aggressors' aggressive policy toward Korea has been defeated, their nature remains unchanged, and they refuse to repent. They are still staying in South Korea and stepping up war preparations, plotting new military adventures.

Truman openly clamored in his congressional message on June 7, 1949, to turn South Korea into an "anti-communist testing ground." He said that the existence of South Korea "has far-reaching implications for the people of Asia."

The "New York Herald Tribune" reported in 1950 that Roberts (head of the advisory group) said: "In Korea, American taxpayers have an army that is a good watchdog guarding America's investment in that country! It is also the least expensive and most effective force."

Dulles assured Syngman Rhee during his visit to Korea in December 1951 that signing the armistice agreement "does not mean abandoning North Korea forever..."

McCarthy said in June 1953: "Any armistice in Korea will only be a temporary respite."

Representative Judd, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee, said at a press conference on March 27, 1954, when discussing the Korean issue: "American policy must still regard Korea as an important anti-communist outpost and support the goal of achieving a free, independent, and unified Korea."

Dulles delivered a speech to the entire United States on May 8, 1954, mentioning: "In Korea, we have shown that we are prepared to take military action in appropriate circumstances and when necessary to safeguard our vital interests and the principles upon which a stable peace must be based." Former commander of the U.S. Tenth Corps, Almond, testified blatantly before the U.S. Congress in late 1954: "There is no better battlefield against the Chinese army than Korea... Korea is a strategic area of the first order."

Eisenhower said on January 25, 1956, when answering reporters' questions about "foreign aid": "Korea receives the largest amount of all this money. But they maintain an army of about twenty divisions." "We hope they will maintain these divisions there now. This is a question of where we can get the maximum effect for our dollars."

Dulles said during his visit to South Korea in March 1956: "The American people believe that justice will eventually prevail, and a free and unified Korea will eventually emerge. The peaceful liberation of the people of North Korea from the "yoke" of communism remains a firm goal of the American people."

MacArthur admitted in a letter published in the "New York Times" on February 4, 1957: "South Korea is a military outpost base of unlimited value."

Decker, Commander of the U.S. Eighth Army and Commander-in-Chief of the "United Nations Forces," said on July 6, 1958, when the Chinese People's Volunteers withdrew their troops in the second stage: "The U.S. military will be stationed in South Korea for the next ten years." He also said that in the event of another war in South Korea, "preparations for atomic warfare are underway, considering the possibility of using atomic weapons." "In order to maintain the atomic weapons currently imported into Korea, the Korean army will receive training to use those atomic weapons for attack."

Dulles issued a statement in 1958 regarding the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea, saying: If the American aggressor troops withdraw, "the mission of the United Nations forces with American participation in Korea has not yet been completed, which is the reunification of Korea achieved under conditions of free elections. I don't think the current situation is suitable for taking an action to withdraw all of our troops."

The U.S. military representative stationed in South Korea said in June 1959: "Once Washington gives the order, they can complete the "atomic offensive" against North Korea in thirty minutes."

Eisenhower said at a press conference on May 11, 1960, that he believed "there is no hope for a rapid and peaceful reunification of Korea."

Eisenhower issued a joint communiqué with Heo Jeong during his visit to South Korea in June 1960, clamoring that the United States would continue to maintain a so-called "strong position" in South Korea as it had in the past ten years, and said that this was a "major factor" in American policy.

    美帝国主义的自供
    编者按：美帝国主义把南朝鲜看作它在亚洲推行侵略政策和准备新战争的一个“前哨基地”，投下了巨大的赌注。1950年它悍然发动了侵朝战争，但在朝中人民的反击下，侵略者遭到了可耻的失败。
    这里摘录了一些美国政府头子和美国军阀关于朝鲜的一些言论，从这些言论中可以看出，侵略者虽然对朝鲜的侵略政策遭到过失败，但是他们本性不改，死不改悔，现在仍然赖在南朝鲜不走，并且在那里加紧备战活动，阴谋进行新的军事冒险。
    杜鲁门1949年6月7日在国会咨文中公开叫嚷要把南朝鲜变成“反共的试验场”。他说，南朝鲜的存在，“对于亚洲人民有远大的影响”。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”1950年报道罗伯茨（顾问团团长）说：“在朝鲜，美国纳税人有着一支军队，这支军队是看守美国在该国的投资的一头很好的看家狗！也是花钱最少而效果最大的一支兵力。”
    杜勒斯1951年12月访问朝鲜时对李承晚保证：签订停战协定，“并不意味着永远放弃北朝鲜……”
    麦卡锡1953年6月说：“朝鲜的任何停战将只不过是暂时的休息。”
    美国众议院外交小组委员会主席周以德1954年3月27日在记者招待会上谈朝鲜问题时说：“美国的政策必须仍然是把朝鲜看作一个重要的反共前哨，并支持实现一个自由、独立和统一的朝鲜的目标。”
    杜勒斯1954年5月8日向全美国发表演说提到：“在朝鲜，我们表明，我们准备在适当情况下，并在必要时采取军事行动，来维护我们的切身利益与稳固和平所必须依据的原则。”美国前第十军军长奥尔蒙德1954年末在美国国会提出的证词中明目张胆地说：“再没有比朝鲜更好的反对中国军队的战场……朝鲜是头等的战略地区。”
    艾森豪威尔1956年1月25日答记者提出的关于“援”外问题的时候说：“从所有这些钱中，朝鲜得到最大一笔。但是他们保持着一支大约二十师的陆军。”“我们希望他们现在在那里保持这些师。这是一个我们用我们的美元在什么地方可以得到最大效果的问题。”
    杜勒斯1956年3月访问南朝鲜时说：“美国人民相信，最后正义必然会取得胜利，一个自由和统一的朝鲜终于会出现。北朝鲜人民从共产党的“桎梏”下获得和平解放，这仍然是美国人民的一个坚定的目标。”
    麦克阿瑟1957年2月4日在“纽约时报”发表的信上招认：“韩国（南朝鲜）是有无限价值的军事前哨基地。”
    美国第八军和“联合国军”总司令德克尔1958年7月6日在中国人民志愿军第二阶段撤军时说：“今后十年间，美军将驻在南朝鲜。”他还说，在南朝鲜再一次发生战争的时候，“考虑到也许会使用原子武器的可能性，正在进行原子战争的准备工作。”“为了维持目前运入韩国内的原子武器，韩国军队将接受训练，以便使用那些原子武器进行攻击。”
    杜勒斯1958年就我志愿军撤出朝鲜一事发表谈话说：“美国侵略军如果撤退，“有美国参加的联合国部队到朝鲜执行的任务现在还没有完成，那就是在自由选举的条件下实现的重新朝鲜统一。我认为现在的形势不适宜于采取把我们的部队全部撤出这样一种行动。”
    美军驻南朝鲜代表1959年6月说：“一旦华盛顿有命令，他们就可以在三十分钟内完成对朝鲜北部的“原子进攻”。
    艾森豪威尔1960年5月11日在记者招待会上讲话时，认为“朝鲜没有迅速和平统一的希望。”
    艾森豪威尔1960年6月访问南朝鲜时与许政发表联合公报，叫嚷美国要像过去十年一样继续在南朝鲜保持所谓“强有力的阵地”，并且说，这是美国政策的“重大因素”。
