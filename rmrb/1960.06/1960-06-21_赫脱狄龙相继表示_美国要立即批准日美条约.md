Xinhua News Agency, Washington, June 20th: Following the Kishi Nobusuke government's declaration that the U.S.-Japan military treaty was "naturally ratified," the American ruling clique is, on the one hand, moving to quickly complete the "ratification" procedures for the U.S.-Japan military treaty by the United States, and on the other hand, clamoring to intensify its attack on the Japanese people.

According to reports, U.S. Secretary of State Herter has indicated to Senate leaders that any delay on the part of the United States in ratification work "runs the risk of creating a bad impression in Tokyo." Deputy Undersecretary of State Dillon, who is acting as Secretary of State during Herter's leave, stated in a television address yesterday that the Senate must immediately complete the treaty ratification procedures.

    赫脱狄龙相继表示
    美国要立即批准日美条约
    据新华社20日讯　华盛顿消息：在岸信介政府宣布美日军事条约“自然成立”之后，美国统治集团正一面着手迅速完成美国对美日军事条约的“批准”手续，一面叫嚣加紧进攻日本人民。
    据报道，美国国务卿赫脱已向参议院的领袖们表明，美国在批准工作方面的任何延迟都“将有在东京造成一种不良的印象的危险”。在赫脱休假期间代理国务卿职务的副国务卿狄龙为此昨天已在电视演说中表示，参议院必须立即完成批准条约的手续。
