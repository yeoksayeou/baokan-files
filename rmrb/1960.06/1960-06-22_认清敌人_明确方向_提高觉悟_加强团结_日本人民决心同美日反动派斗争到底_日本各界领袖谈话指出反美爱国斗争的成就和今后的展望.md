Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 21st: Japanese leaders from all walks of life issued statements today, pointing out the achievements and future prospects of the Japanese people's struggle to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty."

    Shiga Yoshio, member of the Central Committee Secretariat of the Japanese Communist Party, said that it is now necessary to gather the strength of all the Japanese people and direct the spearhead of the struggle towards declaring the new "Security Treaty" completely invalid.

    Shiga Yoshio pointed out that if the Japanese reactionaries insist on implementing the new "Security Treaty" in the future, they will certainly be resolutely resisted by the Japanese people.

    Shiga spoke of the cancellation of the US President's visit to Japan, saying that this was the biggest political and moral defeat suffered by US imperialism in the fifteen years since the war. He said that since the June 18th struggle, the political consciousness of the broad masses of the people has rapidly increased, and it is particularly noteworthy that the number of farmers participating in the struggle is increasing day by day.

    Eda Saburo, Secretary-General of the Japan Socialist Party, pointed out that the current central goal of activities is to strive for the victorious holding of the June 22nd general strike and the June 24th Michiko Kamba National Funeral.

    He stated that the Socialist Party will do its utmost in the future to echo the mass struggles outside the Diet and strive to establish an anti-Kishi united front.

    Yanagimoto Yoshio, Director of the Political Department of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) and Director of the National Council to Prevent the Revision of the "Security Treaty," pointed out that through the struggle to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty," workers and the broad masses of the people have more clearly recognized their two real enemies—US imperialism and the Japanese traitorous reactionaries—which is of great significance.

    Yanagimoto said that therefore, the workers' struggle has received the support of broad public opinion every time, and this struggle will continue to grow into a struggle for Japan's independence and peace.

    Yamada Hazume, Secretary-General of the National Railway Workers' Union, the main force of the June 4th and June 22nd general strikes, pointed out that through the victory of the June 4th general strike and the struggle to prevent Eisenhower's visit to Japan, the unity of the workers has been unprecedentedly strengthened, and their morale is very high. He said that the June 22nd general strike will deal a fatal blow to the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet.

    Yamada stated that in the future, "National Railway" workers will unite closely with workers in other industries, democratic forces, and the broad masses of the people to fight to the end for independence and peace.

    Maeda Minoru, Secretary-General of the Japan Democratic Youth League, pointed out that through participating in the struggle against the US-Japan military alliance treaty, Japanese youth have raised their political awareness, and more and more young people are gathering around the Democratic Youth League.

    Maeda said that especially the students, under the leadership of the working class, have made great contributions not only to the struggle for Japan's independence and peace, but also to safeguarding world peace.

    Maeda pointed out that with the firm unity and struggle of Japanese youth and the people, the new "Security Treaty" will inevitably completely lose its authority and function.

    Tanimoto Takeshi, Secretary-General of the Youth Department of the All-Japan Farmers' Association Federation, said: More and more farmers have participated in the movement against the new "Security Treaty." He cited an example, saying that 30% of the participants in the anti-"Security Treaty" rally held in Niigata City were farmers, and such participation of farmers in political movements is unprecedented.

    He said that the current task of Japanese farmers is to strengthen the struggle of farmers against the security treaty throughout the country.

    Susuda Moriyuki, Chairman of the Tokyo Federation of Commerce and Industry Associations, said that all members of the Federation of Commerce and Industry Associations believe that the so-called "natural establishment" or "ratification" of the "Security Treaty" is invalid.

    Susuda emphasized, "As for our organization, it will continuously hold strikes to protest this treaty and will conduct struggles to support the workers' strikes."

    认清敌人  明确方向  提高觉悟  加强团结
    日本人民决心同美日反动派斗争到底
    日本各界领袖谈话指出反美爱国斗争的成就和今后的展望
    据新华社21日讯　东京消息：日本各界领袖今天发表谈话，指出日本人民阻止修改“安全条约”斗争的成就和今后的展望。
    日本共产党中央委员会干部会委员志贺义雄说，今后必须汇集日本全体人民的力量，把斗争矛头指向宣布新“安全条约”完全无效的方向。
    志贺义雄指出，如果日本反动派今后硬要把新“安全条约”付诸实施，它一定遭到日本人民的坚决抵抗。
    志贺谈到取消美国总统访日时说，这是美帝在战后十五年来所遭到的政治上和道德上的最大的失败。他说，自从六·一八斗争以来，广大阶层人民的政治觉悟迅速提高，尤其引人注目的是农民参加斗争的人数日益增加。
    日本社会党书记长江田三郎指出，目前活动的中心目标在于争取六·二二总罢工和六·二四桦美智子国民葬仪的胜利举行。
    他表示，社会党今后将竭尽力量同国会外面的群众斗争相呼应，为争取建立反岸联合战线而奋斗。
    日本工会总评议会政治部长、阻止修改“安全条约”国民会议干事柳本美雄指出，通过阻止修改“安全条约”斗争，工人和广大人民更加认清他们的两个真正敌人——美帝国主义和日本卖国反动派，这是具有重大意义的。
    柳本说，因此工人的斗争每次都取得广大公众舆论的支持，这个斗争将继续成长为争取日本的独立与和平的斗争。
    作为六·四和六·二二总罢工主力部队的国营铁道工会书记长山田耻目指出，通过六·四总罢工和阻止艾森豪威尔访日斗争的胜利，工人的团结空前加强，士气非常振奋。他说，六·二二总罢工将对岸信介内阁给与致命打击。
    山田表示，今后“国铁”工人将同其他行业的工人、民主力量和广大人民紧密地团结起来，为争取独立与和平而斗争到底。
    日本民主青年同盟书记长前田稔指出，通过参加反对日美军事同盟条约斗争，日本青年提高了政治觉悟，越来越多的青年汇集在民主青年同盟的周围。
    前田说，尤其是学生在工人阶级的领导下不仅对于争取日本独立与和平，而且对于保卫世界和平作出了巨大贡献。
    前田指出，在日本青年和人民坚决团结和斗争下，必将使新“安全条约”完全丧失它的权威和机能。
    全日本农民协会联合会青年部总书记谷本巍说：有越来越多的农民参加了反对新“安全条约”的运动。他举例说，参加新潟市举行的反对“安全条约”大会的30％是农民，农民这样参加政治运动是空前的。
    他说，日本农民当前的任务是加强全国各地的农民反对安全条约的斗争。
    东京工商团体联合会会长漱田守幸说，工商团体联合会的全体会员认为，“安全条约”的所谓“自然成立”或“批准”是无效的。
    漱田强调说，“至于我们的组织，它将不断地举行罢市，抗议这个条约，并将进行斗争，支持工人的罢工。”
