    Hold High the Three Red Banners Even Higher, Fulfill and Overfulfill This Year's National Economic Plan
    Li Xiannian's Report on "The Current Economic Situation" at the National Conference of Outstanding Workers in Culture and Education
    Xinhua News Agency, June 4th. Li Xiannian, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, delivered a report entitled "On the Current Economic Situation" at the National Conference of Advanced Workers in Culture and Education on the 4th. In his report, he elaborated on the excellent situation of China's political economy and called on the people of the whole country to summon greater revolutionary vigor, fulfill and overfulfill this year's national economic plan, and strive to build China into a great socialist power with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture ahead of schedule.
    Vice Premier Li Xiannian began his report by explaining the great achievements made by China's national economy on all fronts since the beginning of this year. He pointed out that the current political and economic situation in China is very good. On the industrial front, we have changed the "conventional" pattern of the first quarter's production always being lower than the fourth quarter of the previous year, and achieved a "good start." The increase in industrial output value from January to mid-May this year was greater than originally expected, with substantial increases in major products such as steel, pig iron, coal, power generation, crude oil, wood, cement, and paper. The high-speed development of industrial production in the first five months has laid a good foundation for the continued leap forward in industry throughout the year. In terms of agricultural production, the sown area of ​​summer harvest crops this year increased by 110 million mu compared with last year, and the area of ​​spring-sown crops also expanded compared with last year. Since the beginning of spring, although many areas have suffered from severe droughts and other natural disasters, relying on the superiority of the people's communes, a great struggle against disasters has been launched, and the losses caused by the disasters have been greatly reduced. The summer harvest has already begun, and many areas have achieved bumper harvests. It seems that the overall harvest nationwide is good, and the summer harvest yield will definitely exceed last year. This year's capital construction is not only large in scale, but also fast in speed. From January to mid-May, the amount of investment in capital construction increased by 50% compared with the same period last year, and 29.5% of the annual plan has been completed. In the first four months of this year, a total of 212 large and medium-sized construction projects across the country have been fully or partially completed and put into production, and more than 7,000 "small modern groups" and "small indigenous groups" enterprises have been completed and put into production. People's communes in rural and urban areas have also established tens of thousands of small industrial enterprises.
    After explaining the achievements made in transportation, commerce and cultural and educational work, Li Xiannian went on to say that the current excellent political and economic situation is not only reflected in the huge growth in production and construction figures, but also in the further improvement of mass awareness and the further development of mass movements. He pointed out that since the beginning of this year, the mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution, with mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation as its main content, has been unfolding across the country, and is now advancing along the correct, scientific, and mass path indicated by Comrade Mao Zedong. Although the high tide of this movement has just begun, it has already achieved remarkable results. From January to April this year, industrial labor productivity increased by about 80% compared with the same period last year. The substantial increase in industrial output value during this period mainly relied on the improvement of labor productivity, rather than relying on increasing the number of employees. More importantly, this movement has opened up a path for us to carry out the technological transformation of the national economy in a faster, better, and more economical way, and has opened up a path for the widespread popularization, great improvement, and great development of science and technology.
    Li Xiannian specially talked about the issue of agricultural technological transformation. He said that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. The technological transformation of agriculture is an important aspect of the entire technological innovation and technological revolution movement. The tool reform movement of the vast number of peasants and the movement of all walks of life to support agriculture have converged into a new upsurge in agricultural technological transformation. Our worker-peasant alliance is being further consolidated and developed in the movement of agricultural technological transformation. It can be fully believed that Comrade Mao Zedong's great call for agricultural mechanization, namely, "small solution in four years, medium solution in seven years, and big solution in ten years," will definitely be realized.
    Li Xiannian then talked about the issue of urban people's communes. He pointed out that the widespread establishment of urban people's communes has brought about another profound, historic, and tremendous change in China's cities. By mid-May, more than 1,000 urban people's communes had been established across the country, with a population of more than 42 million, accounting for about 60% of the urban population. Many cities have basically realized communization. The establishment of urban people's communes has liberated approximately six million women laborers and established more than 60,000 industrial enterprises. Li Xiannian said that the rise of urban people's communes has flustered the propagandists of imperialism and reactionaries. When they were declaring that the rural people's communes in China had failed and the establishment of urban communes was far away, the first batch of urban people's communes that we started on a trial basis in 1958 had successfully passed the test and been consolidated, and a large number of new urban people's communes have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain, vigorously developing forward. The rural people's communes have long embarked on the path of consolidation, soundness, and development. No matter what new lies the propagandists of imperialism and reactionaries will fabricate, the people's commune, this rising sun, is emitting greater and greater brilliance, illuminating the earth.
    When Li Xiannian summed up the current excellent political and economic situation in China, he emphasized that our cause is advancing victoriously. Looking ahead to the whole year from now, the completion and overfulfillment of the national economic plan adopted by the National People's Congress in April this year is guaranteed. Our victory is the victory of the general line, the great leap forward, and the people's commune. It is the victory of the wise leadership of the Party, the victory of the great promotion of the revolutionary spirit of the masses, and ultimately, it is the victory of the Mao Zedong Thought, which combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of Chinese revolution and construction.
    Vice Premier Li Xiannian then emphatically explained the current tasks of the Chinese people. He said that our current task is to hold high the three red banners even higher, namely, the Party's general line for socialist construction, the great leap forward, and the people's commune, to summon greater revolutionary vigor from the people of the whole country, to ride the wind and waves, to strive for the upstream, to fulfill and overfulfill this year's national economic plan, and to strive to catch up with and surpass Britain in the output of major industrial products in less than ten years, to strive to realize the National Agricultural Development Program two or three years ahead of schedule, to strive to realize the Twelve-Year Science Development Plan ahead of schedule, and to build China into a great socialist power with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture.
    Li Xiannian said that there are many things we must do. At present, on the basis of the achievements already made, we should further grasp the movement of technological innovation and technological revolution as the center of the mass movement, so that it can better advance along the correct, scientific, and mass path, so that it has a wider mass character and a higher degree of science, and vigorously carry out the work of consolidation, promotion, and improvement; we should grasp agricultural production and agricultural technological transformation, more widely carry out the movement of all walks of life to support agriculture, and mobilize every department and every unit to do good things for agriculture; we should implement the policy of combining large, medium, and small scales and focusing on small and medium-sized enterprises, greatly develop "small modern groups" and "small indigenous groups" enterprises, and put it in a strategic position as a fundamental plan to accelerate China's industrial construction; we should vigorously engage in diversified operations and comprehensive utilization, realize the integration and continuity of production on the basis of specialization, and strive to make the best use of everything, turn useless things into useful things, turn one use into multiple uses, and turn harmful things into beneficial things; we should continue to consolidate and develop urban and rural people's communes, in order to further promote the development of production, further change the people's spiritual outlook, and accelerate China's socialist construction.
    Li Xiannian said that in our work, we must further implement the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily, running enterprises diligently and thriftily, running communes diligently and thriftily, and running all undertakings diligently and thriftily. We must advocate diligence and thrift, careful calculation and strict budgeting, oppose corruption, oppose waste, strive to accelerate construction in all aspects, and enrich reserve forces. In all leading organs, we must oppose bureaucracy, formalism, and commandism, and do our work down-to-earth. Our achievements are great, and the vast majority of our cadres are good cadres, but shortcomings and mistakes will always exist in our work, and some are unavoidable due to lack of experience. These shortcomings and mistakes must be taken seriously and resolutely corrected. We should, as Comrade Mao Zedong often taught us, wash our faces every day and sweep away dust every day. We must despise difficulties strategically, and at the same time, we must attach importance to difficulties tactically and conscientiously overcome them.
    Li Xiannian said that the people are the creators of history. The mass movement runs through all aspects of our work. Revolution requires mass movement, and construction also requires mass movement; the production management of enterprises requires mass movement, and the reform of production technology also requires mass movement; economic departments require mass movement, and cultural and educational departments and other departments also require mass movement. Under the leadership of the Party, adhering to the policy of putting politics in command and vigorously carrying out mass movements is universally applicable and invincible. In the mass movement, we must pay attention to cherishing the high revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses. In order to maintain this enthusiasm and drive for a long time, we must arrange the time for labor, study, and rest well, with both work and leisure, and combine work and rest; while grasping production, we must cordially care about the lives of the masses.
    Li Xiannian said that the technological revolution must be closely combined with the ideological revolution and the cultural revolution. The great leap forward of the national economy and the great development of technological innovation and technological revolution have put forward many new topics for our cultural and educational work. Comrades on the cultural and educational front, first of all, the delegates present here, must further devote yourselves to the fiery mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution with full enthusiasm, on the one hand, helping workers and peasants to improve their culture, improve their scientific and technological knowledge, inspire revolutionary vigor, strengthen publicity and reporting, carry out recreational activities, talk about hygiene and eliminate diseases, develop sports, and enhance physical fitness; on the other hand, learning from the workers and peasants, helping them to sum up experience, concentrate their wisdom, and systematize and theorize their great creations in production practice, so as to develop scientific theories and create new scientific theories. The technological revolution, the ideological revolution, and the cultural revolution converge into a huge tide, developing wave upon wave, which will accelerate our process of building socialism and moving towards communism.
    Li Xiannian said that in order to achieve greater victories on all fronts and to complete the great tasks of socialist revolution and socialist construction, the fundamental issue is to honestly further study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Comrade Mao Zedong's theory on socialist revolution and socialist construction, and study Comrade Mao Zedong's thought methods and work methods. Comrade Mao Zedong summarized the rich experience of the Chinese revolution and construction and the rich experience of the international communist movement. Comrade Mao Zedong inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism under new historical conditions. The three magic weapons of our Party's general line for socialist construction, the great leap forward, and the people's commune are based on Mao Zedong Thought as the theoretical foundation. In the past, we relied on the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought to achieve great victories; in the future, we must achieve greater victories under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. The upsurge of studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works that has recently been launched throughout the country is a great communist ideological movement, which will have an immeasurable impact on our revolutionary and construction undertakings.
    Li Xiannian finally called on the people of the whole country to advance bravely towards the highest ideal of communism with the soaring vigor and perseverance of conquering Mount Everest. He emphasized that we have the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, we have 650 million awakened and organized people, we have a strong socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and we have the support of the people of the world. Our future is infinitely bright, and our victory is certain. Recently, the tide of the people of the world opposing US imperialism and its running dogs, opposing all imperialism and reactionaries, has been rising higher and higher. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The life of imperialism will not be long. They have done all kinds of bad things, and all the oppressed people of the world will never forgive them." The future of the world belongs to socialism and communism.

    更高地举起三面红旗，完成和超额完成今年国民经济计划
    李先念在全国文教群英会上作“关于当前的经济情况”的报告
    新华社4日讯　中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理李先念4日在全国文教先进工作者代表大会上，以“关于当前的经济情况”为题作了报告。他在报告中详细说明了当前我国政治经济的大好形势，号召全国人民鼓足更大的革命干劲，完成和超额完成今年的国民经济计划，为提前把我国建设成为一个具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义强国而奋斗。
    李先念副总理在报告一开始就分别说明了今年以来我国国民经济各条战线取得的巨大成就。他指出，当前我国政治、经济形势好得很。在工业战线上，我们改变了过去第一季度生产总要低于前一年第四季度的“常规”，实现了“开门红”。今年1月至5月中旬工业产值增长的幅度比原来的预计更大，钢、生铁、煤炭、发电量、原油、木材、水泥、纸张等主要产品都有大幅度的增长。前五个月工业生产的高速度发展，为全年工业的继续跃进打下了良好的基础。在农业生产方面，今年夏收作物的播种面积比去年增加了一亿一千万亩，春播作物的面积也比去年扩大了。入春以来，不少地区虽然遭受了严重的旱灾和其他自然灾害，但是依靠人民公社的优越性，开展了伟大的抗灾斗争，灾害所引起的损失大为减轻。目前夏收已经开始，不少地区获得了丰收，看来全国总的收成是好的，夏收产量肯定会超过去年。今年的基本建设不仅规模大，而且速度快。1月至5月中旬，基本建设投资额比去年同期增长50％，已经完成全年计划29．5％。今年头四个月全国已经全部或部分建成投入生产的大中型建设项目共有二百一十二个，建成投入生产的“小洋群”“小土群”企业有七千多个。各地农村和城市的人民公社还兴办了几万个小型工业企业。
    李先念在说明了交通运输、商业工作和文教战线取得的成就后，接着说，目前政治经济的大好形势，不仅表现在生产建设数字的巨大增长上，而且表现在群众觉悟的进一步提高和群众运动的进一步发展上。他指出，今年年初以来，全国展开的以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为主要内容的技术革新和技术革命群众运动，现在正在沿着毛泽东同志所指示的正确的、科学的、全民的轨道前进。这个运动的高潮虽然还刚刚开始，但是已经收到显著的效果。今年1至4月份工业劳动生产率比去年同期提高80％左右。这个期间工业产值的大幅度增长主要是依靠劳动生产率的提高，而不是依靠增加职工人数。更重要的是，这个运动给我们开辟了一条多快好省地进行国民经济技术改造的道路，开辟了一条科学技术大普及、大提高、大发展的道路。
    李先念特别谈到了农业技术改造问题。他说，农业是国民经济的基础。农业的技术改造是整个技术革新和技术革命运动的一个重要方面。广大农民的工具改革运动和各行各业支援农业的运动已经汇成为农业技术改造的新高潮。我们的工农联盟正在农业技术改造的运动中得到进一步的巩固和发展。完全可以相信，毛泽东同志提出的关于农业机械化“四年小解决、七年中解决、十年大解决”的伟大号召，一定可以实现。
    李先念接着谈到了城市人民公社问题。他指出，城市人民公社的广泛建立，使我国城市经历着又一次深刻的历史性的巨大变化。到5月中旬，全国已经建立城市人民公社一千多个，入社人口四千二百多万人，约占城市人口的60％。不少城市已经基本上实现了公社化。城市人民公社的建立，已经解放了大约六百万妇女劳动力，举办了六万多个工业企业。李先念说，城市人民公社的兴起，使帝国主义和反动派的宣传家慌了手脚，当他们正在宣称中国农村人民公社已经失败，城市公社的建立，已经遥遥无期的时候，我国在1958年以来开始试办的第一批城市人民公社已经胜利地通过了考验而得到巩固，大量的新的城市人民公社像雨后春笋般地建立起来，生气勃勃地向前发展着，农村人民公社早已经走上巩固的健全发展的道路，不管帝国主义和反动派的宣传家还会编造什么新的谎言，人民公社这个已经升起的太阳越来越发出更大的光辉，普照着大地。
    李先念在总括当前我国政治经济的大好形势时，着重指出，我们的事业正在胜利地前进，从现在展望全年，今年4月全国人民代表大会通过的国民经济计划的完成和超额完成是有保证的。我们的胜利是总路线、大跃进、人民公社的胜利，是党的英明领导的胜利，是群众革命精神大发扬的胜利，归根到底，是马克思列宁主义普遍真理同中国革命和建设实践相结合的毛泽东思想的胜利。
    李先念副总理然后着重地说明我国人民当前的任务。他说，当前我们的任务，就是要更高地举起党的社会主义建设总路线、大跃进、人民公社这三面红旗，鼓起全国人民更大的革命干劲，乘风破浪，力争上游，完成和超额完成今年的国民经济计划，并且为争取在不到十年的时间内在主要工业产品产量方面赶上和超过英国，为争取提前两三年实现全国农业发展纲要，为争取提前实现十二年科学发展规划，把我国建设成为一个具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义强国而奋斗。
    李先念说，我们须要做的事情很多。当前应当在已经获得成绩的基础上，进一步抓紧作为群众运动中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，使它更好地沿着正确的、科学的、全民的轨道前进，使它具有更广泛的全民性和更高度的科学性，并且大力进行巩固、推广和提高的工作；应当抓紧农业生产和农业的技术改造，更广泛地开展各行各业支援农业的运动，发动每个部门每个单位为农业办好事；应当实行大中小并举和以中小型企业为主的建设方针，大大发展“小洋群”“小土群”企业，把它放在一个战略地位上，作为加速我国工业建设的一条根本之计；应当大搞多种经营和综合利用，在专业化的基础上实现生产的联合化和连续化，并且努力做到物尽其用，变无用为有用，变一用为多用，变有害为有利；应当继续巩固和发展城乡人民公社，以进一步推动生产的发展，进一步改变人民的精神面貌，加速我国的社会主义建设。
    李先念说，在我们的工作中，必须进一步贯彻执行勤俭建国、勤俭办企业、勤俭办社、勤俭办一切事业的方针。我们要在各方面提倡勤俭节约，精打细算，反对贪污，反对浪费，努力加速建设，并且充实后备力量。在一切领导机关中，要反对官僚主义、形式主义、命令主义的作风，踏踏实实地把工作做好。我们的成绩是伟大的，我们的干部绝大多数是好干部，但是在工作中缺点和错误总是会有的，有些由于缺乏经验是难以避免的。对于这些缺点和错误，必须认真对待，切实纠正。应当像毛泽东同志所经常教导我们的那样，天天洗脸，天天打扫灰尘。我们要在战略上藐视困难，同时又要在战术上重视困难，认真地克服困难。
    李先念说，人民群众是历史的创造者。群众运动贯彻到我们工作的一切方面。革命要搞群众运动，建设同样要搞群众运动；企业的生产管理要搞群众运动，生产技术的改革同样要搞群众运动；经济部门要搞群众运动，文化教育部门和其他部门同样要搞群众运动。在党的领导下，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动的方针，是放之四海而皆准的，是无往而不胜的。在群众运动中，要注意爱护群众高度的革命热情，为了使这种热情和干劲长期保持下去，要很好地安排劳动、学习和休息的时间，有劳有逸，劳逸结合；要在抓紧生产的同时，亲切地关心群众的生活。
    李先念说，技术革命要和思想革命、文化革命密切结合起来。国民经济的大跃进，技术革新和技术革命的大发展，给我们的文化教育工作提出了许许多多新课题。文化教育战线的同志们，首先是在座的代表同志们，要以满腔的热忱进一步投入到技术革新和技术革命这个火热的群众运动中去，一方面帮助工人农民提高文化，提高科学技术知识，鼓舞革命干劲，加强宣传报道，开展文娱活动，大讲卫生、消除疾病，发展体育，增强体质；另一方面向工人、农民群众学习，帮助他们总结经验，把他们的智慧集中起来，把他们在生产实践中的伟大创造加以系统化、理论化，从而发展科学理论，创造新的科学理论。技术革命、思想革命和文化革命汇合成巨大的潮流，一浪高一浪的发展，将会加速我们建设社会主义和走向共产主义的进程。
    李先念说，要在各个战线上取得更大的胜利，要完成社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大任务，根本的问题是老老实实地进一步学习和运用毛泽东思想，学习和运用毛泽东同志关于社会主义革命和社会主义建设的理论，学习毛泽东同志的思想方法和工作方法。毛泽东同志概括了中国革命和建设的丰富经验以及国际共产主义运动的丰富经验。毛泽东同志在新的历史条件下继承、保卫和发展了马克思列宁主义。我们党的社会主义建设总路线、大跃进、人民公社这三个法宝，就是以毛泽东思想作为理论基础的。在过去，我们依靠毛泽东思想的指引取得了伟大的胜利；在今后，我们更要在毛泽东思想的指引下取得更大的胜利。最近在全国范围内开展起来的学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东著作的高潮，是一个伟大的共产主义思想运动，它对于我们的革命和建设事业将发生不可估量的作用。
    李先念最后号召全国人民要以征服珠穆朗玛峰的冲天干劲和坚忍毅力，向着共产主义的最高理想勇猛前进。他强调说：我们有党中央和毛泽东同志的英明领导，有六亿五千万觉悟起来组织起来的人民，有强大的以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，有全世界人民的支持，我们的前途无限光明，我们的胜利是肯定了的。最近全世界人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的浪潮，反对一切帝国主义和反动派的浪潮越来越高涨。正如毛泽东同志所说：“帝国主义的寿命不会很长了，他们做尽了坏事，全世界一切受压迫的人民决不会饶恕他们。”世界的未来是属于社会主义和共产主义的。
