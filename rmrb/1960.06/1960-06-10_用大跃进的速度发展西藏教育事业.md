Develop Tibetan Education at Great Leap Forward Speed
Zha Xi Zhuo Ma, Teacher at Rikaze Primary School, Tibet

I am a teacher at Rikaze Primary School in Tibet. I was born into a poor serf family and was sent to a monastery as a nun when I was a child. It was not until 1954 that the Communist Party liberated me from the darkness. Under the Party's cultivation, I grew from an ignorant girl into a revolutionary people's teacher. My growth process is a process in which the Party constantly educated and improved me with infinite care, and it is also the result of the enthusiastic help of Han comrades.

When I first started working, I had very little cultural knowledge. I couldn't even do addition and subtraction in arithmetic, let alone teaching skills and work experience. It was difficult for me to teach even the lowest class, so there were many difficulties in my work. However, thanks to the Party's education and the kind help of Han comrades, and through my own hard work, I overcame various difficulties, and my cultural level and professional skills were quickly improved. Now, I can teach arithmetic and Chinese classes for the third grade of primary school, and I can also serve as an oral translator for natural science, geography and other courses with deeper content.

From my own experience, I deeply realize that the Communist Party is my reborn parent, it is the Party that gave me a new life, it is the Party that gave me wisdom and strength, and led me onto the bright and happy path. I am grateful to the Party, love the Party, and listen to the Party. Wherever the Party points, I will go there. I resolutely implement the Party's educational policies in my school work.

The Party's policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor is the key to running schools well and improving teaching quality. It is completely in line with the actual situation in Tibet and is warmly supported by the vast working people of Tibet. However, a small number of teachers, students, and parents from exploiting classes have a certain resistance to implementing this policy of the Party. They mistakenly believe that labor is a lowly thing and are unwilling to participate in the productive labor activities organized by the school. After the Party discovered these problems, it promptly educated them. I also repeatedly explained to them the great significance of the Party's education being combined with productive labor, and the principles of labor being glorious and exploitation being shameful, and influenced them with my own practical actions of actively participating in labor. Eventually, they corrected their thinking and actively participated in productive labor.

In order to continuously improve teachers' political consciousness, transform their thinking, strengthen unity, and do a good job in school work, I can often examine myself, strive to overcome shortcomings, and at the same time, I can also actively help others and carry out ideological mutual assistance among comrades.

When I recall my own changes, I cannot help but think of the development and changes in education in the Tibet region. In the past year, tremendous changes have taken place in Tibetan society. Under the leadership of the Party, the vast people of Tibet overthrew the reactionary rule of the serf owner class. Millions of serfs stood up like giants and became masters of the country.

Before the peaceful liberation of Tibet, under the reactionary rule of the feudal serf system, culture and education were very backward, and the vast serfs had no opportunity or right to learn culture and receive education. After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the Party attached great importance to the development of culture and education in Tibet, but due to the obstruction of the upper-level reactionary group, the education undertakings that the Party had set up for the Tibetan working people were greatly restricted, just like other undertakings.

The victory of the suppression of the rebellion and the democratic reform has opened up an unprecedentedly broad road for the development of socialist education in Tibet. The emancipated serfs and slaves urgently demand to learn culture. In order to meet the requirements of the cultural emancipation of the working people, the Party, based on the current actual situation in Tibet, formulated the policy of running primary education mainly by the people and supplemented by public schools. Under the correct guidance of this policy, a high tide of mass school running has been set off throughout the region in a short period of one year. People-run primary schools and mass night schools have sprung up like mushrooms. According to statistics, 456 people-run primary schools have been built in the region, with 21,136 students, which is ten times the number of public primary schools before the suppression of the rebellion. The development of mass night schools is also very rapid. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently 128 night schools in the region, with 8,926 young and middle-aged students. In addition, ten public primary schools and one teacher training class have been added in the past year. The achievements mentioned above are the victory of the Party in carrying out mass movements in education.

Once public and private schools are established, they actively implement the Party's educational policy of serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor. Schools carry out patriotic and socialist education for students, and the vast number of teachers and students enthusiastically participate in the great democratic reform struggle. On the one hand, they powerfully supported the emancipation of the vast number of serfs, and on the other hand, they also educated and trained the vast number of teachers and students to improve their class consciousness, making them love the Party and the working people even more. Various work-study activities have been carried out in combination with productive labor. In addition to the agricultural, animal husbandry, sideline, and handicraft production labor organized within the school, in order to support the peasants in winning a bumper harvest in agriculture in 1960, teachers and students also actively participated in the mass movement of accumulating fertilizer and vigorously building water conservancy projects. These productive activities played a great role in cultivating the labor concepts and labor habits of teachers and students; at the same time, some schools solved the problem of self-sufficiency in vegetables and school funding expenditures.

This conference has given me a profound education. I must bring the spirit of the conference back to Tibet and resolutely implement it in our school. The development of education in Tibet has just begun. We, the people of all ethnic groups in Tibet, firmly believe that under the correct leadership of the Party and under the brilliant light of the general line, we will surely be able to develop the socialist education in Tibet at a greater leap forward speed.

    用大跃进的速度发展西藏教育事业
    西藏日喀则小学教师　扎西卓玛
    我是西藏日喀则小学的教师，出身于贫苦农奴家庭，小时候，就被送进寺院当尼姑，直到1954年，共产党才把我从黑暗中解放出来。在党的培养下，我由一个一无所知的女孩子，成长为一个革命的人民教师，我的成长过程，是党以无限的关怀，不断的对我进行教育提高的过程，也是汉族同志经常对我热情帮助的结果。
    当我刚刚参加工作的时候，我可以说是没有什么文化知识的，算术连加减法都不会，更谈不上教学业务知识和工作经验了，连最低班的教学我都很难胜任，因此工作中困难是很多的。但是由于党的教育培养和汉族同志的亲切帮助，经过了自己刻苦地学习，克服了各种困难，使自己的文化程度和业务水平很快得到了提高。现在，我已经能教小学三年级的算术课和汉语课，还能担任内容较深的自然、地理等课的口语翻译。
    从我的亲身经历中，使我深深地认识到，共产党是我的再生父母，是党给了我新生，是党给了我智慧和力量，使我走上了光明幸福的大道，我从内心感激党、热爱党，听党的话，党指向哪里，我就奔向哪里，在学校工作中坚决贯彻执行党的教育方针政策。
    党的教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合的方针是办好学校提高教学质量的关键。它完全符合西藏的实际情况，为西藏广大劳动人民热烈拥护，但是，少数出身于剥削阶级的教师、学生和家长对贯彻党的这一方针却抱有一定的抵触情绪，他们错误的认为劳动是低贱的事，不愿参加学校组织的生产劳动活动，党发现这些问题后，即对他们及时的进行了教育，我也向他们反复说明党的教育必须与生产劳动相结合的重大意义，及劳动光荣、剥削可耻的道理，并以自己积极带头参加劳动的实际行动影响他们，而终于使他们端正了自己的思想，积极地参加了生产劳动。
    为了不断提高教师的政治觉悟，改造思想，增强团结，做好学校工作，我能经常检查自己，努力克服缺点，同时我也能主动地帮助别人，展开同志间的思想互助。
    当我回忆自己的变化的时候，使我不能不联想到西藏地区的教育工作的发展变化。在过去的一年时间里，西藏社会已经发生了翻天复地的巨大变化，西藏广大人民在党的领导下，推翻了农奴主阶级的反动统治，百万农奴像巨人一样站立起来成为国家的主人。
    西藏和平解放前，在封建农奴制度的反动统治下，文化教育十分落后，广大农奴根本没有学习文化和受教育的机会和权利。西藏和平解放后，党很重视发展西藏的文化教育事业，但是由于上层反动集团的百般阻挠，使党为西藏劳动人民所举办的教育事业也和其它事业一样受到了极大的限制。
    平叛和民主改革的胜利为发展西藏的社会主义教育事业开辟了空前广阔的道路，翻身的农奴和奴隶迫切要求学习文化，党为了满足劳动人民文化翻身的要求，根据西藏当前的实际情况，制定小学教育以民办为主、公办为辅的两条腿走路的办学方针，在这个方针的正确指导下，在短短的一年时间内，全区掀起了一个群众办学的高潮，民办小学和群众夜校，如雨后春笋般的蓬勃发展起来，据统计全区已兴建民办小学四百五十六所，学生人数达二万一千一百三十六人，较平叛前公立小学的人数增加了十倍，群众夜校的发展也很迅速。据不完全统计，全区现有夜校一百二十八所，青壮年学生达八千九百二十六人，此外一年来还增加了公立小学十所和师资训练班一所。以上成就的取得，是党在教育事业方面大搞群众运动的胜利。
    公办和民办学校一经建立，都积极地贯彻执行了党的教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的教育方针，校内对学生开展了爱国主义和社会主义教育，广大师生都踊跃地参加伟大的民主改革斗争。一方面有力地支援了广大农奴的翻身解放，另一方面也教育锻炼了广大师生提高了他们的阶级觉悟，使他们更加热爱党，热爱劳动人民。在结合生产劳动上展开了各项勤工俭学的活动，除校内组织的农、牧、副、手工业的生产劳动外，为了支援农民在1960年夺取农业上的大丰收，教师和学生还积极地参加了群众的大搞积肥，大力兴修水利运动，这些生产活动对于培养师生的劳动观点和劳动习惯起了很大的作用；同时部分学校解决了蔬菜自给和学校经费开支问题。
    这次大会使我受到了一次深刻的教育，我一定要把大会的精神带回西藏去，并且在我们学校里坚决贯彻执行。西藏教育事业的发展才刚刚开始，我们西藏各族人民坚信，在党的正确领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，一定能用更大跃进的速度，发展西藏社会主义的教育事业。
