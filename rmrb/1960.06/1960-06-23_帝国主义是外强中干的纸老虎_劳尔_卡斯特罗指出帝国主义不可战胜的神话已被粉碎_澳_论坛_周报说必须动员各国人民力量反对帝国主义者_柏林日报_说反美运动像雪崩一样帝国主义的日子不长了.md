Imperialism is a Paper Tiger, Appearing Strong But Being Weak
Raúl Castro Points Out That the Myth of Imperialism's Invincibility Has Been Shattered
Australian "Tribune" Weekly Says It Is Necessary to Mobilize the Power of the People of All Countries to Oppose the Imperialists
"Berliner Zeitung" Says the Anti-American Movement is Like an Avalanche, Imperialism's Days Are Numbered

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 20th - Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces Minister Raúl Castro said at a youth conference here last night that the struggle of Cuban youth has shattered the myth that imperialism is invincible. He said that history proves that American imperialism is an eagle with molting feathers, its claws wounded by plundering the peoples of Latin American countries. It has been flying lower and lower, and one day it will fall to the ground and crawl.

At the youth conference, held to prepare for the Latin American Youth Congress to be held in Havana on July 26 this year, Raúl Castro strongly expressed the Cuban youth's belief in defeating American imperialist aggression. He said that the graves that imperialism is digging for Cuba in Florida to bury the revolution may become their own graves.

He also said that the peoples of Latin American countries have understood that the Cuban revolution is their revolution, and our enemy is a common one. It is no accident that the entire Latin America is chanting the slogan "Cuba yes, Yankees no." The vicious slander propaganda carried out by imperialist news agencies has gone bankrupt.

He said that the eagle with molting feathers does not refer to the American people. We are friendly with the American people.

Referring to the U.S. sabotage of the summit conference, Raúl Castro pointed out that monopoly organizations profit from the Cold War, and continuing the Cold War enables them to continue manufacturing and selling rockets and armaments. He also said that the Cuban government would not take action against the American naval base at Guantanamo in Cuba, but he said, "One day it will be returned to us."

Also speaking at the meeting were Ricardo Alarcón, representative of the Cuban University Students Federation, and Luis Felipe Gracia, youth secretary of the Cuban Workers Federation. In their speeches, they expressed their contempt for American imperialism and their belief in breaking free from imperialist enslavement. Referring to the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, Alarcón said that in the face of united and fighting people, the American Seventh Fleet is a weak scarecrow.

Xinhua News Agency, 21st - Sydney News: The Australian Communist Party's organ, the "Tribune" Weekly, said in its June 22nd issue that it is now necessary to mobilize the strength of all countries' people to oppose the imperialists, because as long as the imperialists rule anywhere, there is still a danger of war.

"Tribune" Weekly said, "To avoid this danger, the Japanese have played and are playing their role. Now it remains for us to play our role."

The weekly said, "The major blow by the Japanese people is not only against the new U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty,' but also against the entire system of nuclear-armed military alliances used by the imperialists to encircle the globe."

The weekly said that the whole purpose of American imperialism is to make Japan a reliable "ally" and a fixed anchor of imperialism in the Pacific, but now the "ally" is no longer reliable, and the anchor is also drifting.

The weekly said that Eisenhower is not a messenger of goodwill, but a traveling warmonger.

"He was forbidden to enter the Soviet Union, forbidden to enter Japan, chased around like a fugitive on the small island of Okinawa, he lost face and crawled back home, something that no head of a major power has ever experienced before."

The weekly praised the role played by the Japanese Communist Party in this struggle for peace, praising the Japanese people who are sympathized with by the world's peace forces. It said that the Japanese people's struggle for world peace is worth learning by all Australians. "Tribune" Weekly also pointed out that taking violence against disciplined peaceful demonstrators makes the whole world see who is actually using violence.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 22nd - An article by Professor Stefan Heymann entitled "Imperialism is a Paper Tiger," published in the "Berliner Zeitung" on the 21st, pointed out that the movement against American imperialism has recently been advancing like an avalanche. Imperialism is the enemy of all people, and imperialism's days are numbered.

The article pointed out that in the past few weeks, American imperialists have suffered successive defeats. Due to the stormy actions of the people of Turkey and South Korea, supporters of the U.S. policy of encircling the socialist camp have been ousted, and Kishi Nobusuke will suffer the same fate as other dictators. Eisenhower's setback at the hands of the Japanese people is particularly painful for American imperialism. This is not only a failure for the United States in Japan, but also a failure for it in the entire Asia.

The article said that it is no accident that the movement against American imperialism is advancing like an avalanche. The events in South Korea, Turkey, Japan, and other countries clearly show that the entire imperialist system is now struggling in the throes of death. This system is approaching collapse more and more rapidly.

It has become increasingly clear that imperialism is the enemy of all people. It is the irreconcilable enemy of the sovereignty and equality of all countries, it suppresses democracy. As Comrade Stalin said at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, only the working class is qualified to hold high the banner of democratic freedom and national independence. Comrade Mao Zedong said that imperialism is a "paper tiger" because imperialism is outwardly strong but inwardly weak, because it does not have the support of the people. However, as long as imperialism exists, it is dangerous, and we must maintain close vigilance.

The article concluded that the struggle against imperialism in the past few weeks will strengthen the confidence of all working people, thereby accelerating the inevitable failure of the imperialist system and the inevitable victory of socialism.

    帝国主义是外强中干的纸老虎
    劳尔·卡斯特罗指出帝国主义不可战胜的神话已被粉碎
    澳“论坛”周报说必须动员各国人民力量反对帝国主义者
    “柏林日报”说反美运动像雪崩一样帝国主义的日子不长了
    新华社哈瓦那20日电　古巴革命武装部部长劳尔·卡斯特罗昨天晚上在这里的一次青年会议上说，古巴青年的斗争粉碎了关于帝国主义是不可战胜的神话。他说，历史证明，美帝国主义是一只羽毛脱落的老鹰，它的爪子由于掠夺拉丁美洲各国人民而受了伤。它已经飞得越来越低，终有一天它会掉在地上爬行。
    在这次为了筹备今年7月26日在哈瓦那举行的拉丁美洲青年代表大会而举行的青年会议上，劳尔·卡斯特罗强烈地表达了古巴青年战胜美帝国主义侵略的信念，他说，帝国主义正在佛罗里达给古巴挖掘的用来埋葬革命的坟墓，可能成为埋葬他们自己的坟墓。
    他还说，拉丁美洲各国人民已经懂得，古巴革命就是他们的革命，我们的敌人是共同的。整个拉丁美洲都高呼“要古巴不要美国佬”的口号，这并不是偶然的。帝国主义通讯社所进行的恶毒的诬蔑宣传破了产。
    他说，羽毛脱落的帝国主义老鹰指的不是美国人民。我们同美国人民是友好的。
    劳尔·卡斯特罗在谈到美国破坏最高级会议时指出，垄断组织是靠冷战来获利的，继续冷战使它们得以继续制造和出售火箭和军备。他还表示，古巴政府将不采取行动反对美国在古巴关塔那摩的海军基地，但是，他说，“终有一天它会归还我们”。
    在会上发言的还有古巴大学生联合会代表理卡多·阿拉孔和古巴工人联合会青年书记路易斯·费利佩·格拉等。他们在谈话中都表示了对美帝国主义的蔑视和摆脱帝国主义奴役的信念。阿拉孔在谈到日本人民反对日美安全条约的斗争时说，在团结一致进行斗争的人民面前，美国的第七舰队是软弱无力的稻草人。
    新华社21日讯　悉尼消息：澳大利亚共产党机关报“论坛”周报在6月22日的一期中说，现在必须动员所有各国人民的力量来反对帝国主义者，因为只要帝国主义者还统治着任何地方，就还存在着战争危险。
    “论坛”周报说，“为了避免这种危险，日本人已经发挥和正在发挥他们的作用。现在有待于我们发挥作用”。
    这家周报说，日本人民的重大打击不但是针对新日美“安全条约”的，“而且是针对帝国主义者用来包围地球的核武装军事联盟的整个体系。”
    这家周报说，美帝国主义的全部目的是要使日本成为一个牢靠的“盟国”和帝国主义在太平洋中固定的铁锚，但是现在“盟国”不再可靠，铁锚也漂动了。
    这家周报说，艾森豪威尔不是亲善的使者，而是旅行的战争贩子。
  “他被禁止进入苏联，被禁止进入日本，在小小的冲绳岛上像一个亡命者似的被追来追去，他丢尽了脸，爬回国去，这是一个大国首脑以前从来没有经历过的”。
    这家周报赞扬了日本共产党在这一争取和平的斗争中所发挥的作用，称赞受到全世界和平力量同情的日本人民。它说，日本人民争取世界和平的斗争值得所有澳大利亚人学习。“论坛”周报还指出，对有纪律的和平示威者采取暴力，这就使全世界看到，实际使用暴力的是谁。
    据新华社柏林22日电　“柏林日报”21日发表的斯特凡·海曼教授的题为“帝国主义是纸老虎”的文章中指出，反对美帝国主义的运动近来像雪崩一样向前发展。帝国主义是所有人们的敌人，帝国主义的日子不长了。
    文章指出，在过去几个星期中，美帝国主义者接连地遭到失败。由于土耳其和南朝鲜人民的暴风雨般的行动，美国包围社会主义阵营政策的支持者已被赶下台，岸信介也将会得到同其他独裁者同样的下场。艾森豪威尔遭受日本人民的打击，这对于美帝国主义来说是特别惨痛的。这不仅是美国在日本的失败，也是它在整个亚洲的失败。
    文章说，反对美帝国主义的运动像雪崩一样向前发展，这不是偶然的。南朝鲜、土耳其、日本等国家发生的事件清楚地表明，整个帝国主义体系现在正在死亡的痛苦中挣扎。这个体系正愈来愈迅速地临近垮台。
    帝国主义是所有人们的敌人，这一点已经日益清楚。它是所有国家的主权和平等的不共戴天的敌人，它镇压民主。正如斯大林同志在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上所说的，只有工人阶级有资格高举民主自由和民族独立的旗帜。毛泽东同志说，帝国主义是“纸老虎”，因为帝国主义是外强中干的，因为它没有人民的支持。然而，只要帝国主义存在，它便是危险的，我们必须严密地保持警惕。
    文章最后说，在过去几星期中的反对帝国主义的斗争，将加强所有劳动人民的信心，从而加速帝国主义制度的必然失败和社会主义的必然胜利。
