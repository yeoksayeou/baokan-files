Dear Comrade Haxhi Lleshi, Dear Comrade Liri Belishova, Dear Albanian Guests, Comrades, Friends:
    Today, the people of all walks of life in our capital are very happy to be here welcoming our distinguished guests, Comrade Haxhi Lleshi, Chairman of the Presidium of People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Albania, Comrade Liri Belishova, and other Albanian comrades. On behalf of all the people of Beijing, I extend a warm welcome to our distinguished guests.
    The Albanian people are heroic people with glorious revolutionary traditions. In order to win liberation, they carried out a long and heroic struggle against foreign imperialism and domestic reactionary rulers, and finally won a great victory. After liberation, the Albanian people, under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party, put forward the heroic slogan of "holding a pick in one hand and a gun in the other," defending their motherland while carrying out socialist revolution and socialist construction. Now Albania has changed from a backward agricultural country into a socialist agricultural-industrial country. In 1959, Albania's total industrial output value increased twenty-one times compared with 1938. The socialist transformation of agriculture has also achieved a decisive victory. The cultivated land area under cooperation has accounted for 83.2% of the country's total cultivated land area, and the plain areas have been completely cooperativized. Cultural and educational undertakings are booming, and illiteracy among people under the age of 40 has been eliminated nationwide.
    The Albanian people have achieved such amazing achievements in a short historical period, which eloquently proves the invincible and great vitality of Marxism-Leninism and the incomparable superiority of the socialist system, and proves that no matter how small a country is, and no matter how weak its past economic foundation is, once the working people have seized power, under the correct leadership of a Marxist-Leninist party, they will definitely be able to create real miracles and accomplish earth-shattering undertakings. The Chinese people are delighted and encouraged by these achievements of the Albanian people.
    The Albanian government has always unswervingly pursued a peaceful foreign policy, resolutely opposed the aggression and war policies of the imperialist bloc headed by the United States, and supported the national democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Especially in maintaining peace in the Balkan region, Albania has made tremendous efforts. Albania has become an important force in guaranteeing peace in the Balkan region and has been universally respected by peace-loving people all over the world.
    The Albanian people have consistently been loyal to proletarian internationalism and resolutely defended the great unity among the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union. The Albanian Labor Party and the people have always waged an irreconcilable struggle against Yugoslav modern revisionism in order to defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism. The Albanian Party and the people have used a large number of facts to relentlessly expose the ugly face of the Tito clique betraying the international communist movement and acting as a running dog of U.S. imperialism, and have given a strong rebuff to their various provocations and sabotage activities. The Chinese people sincerely admire the high degree of revolutionary principle and strong fighting will shown by the Albanian people in the struggle against modern revisionism.
    At present, the people of the world are facing the urgent task of further exposing the essence of U.S. imperialism, opposing its policy of aggression and war, and safeguarding world peace. After sabotaging the summit conference of the four heads of government, U.S. imperialism, despite talking about so-called "peace efforts" and expressing its willingness to continue negotiations with the Soviet Union, is actually creating tension everywhere and frantically stepping up its arms expansion and war preparations. The United States instructed Nobusuke Kishi of Japan to forcibly and illegally "pass" the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. The United States is plotting to lift the arms restrictions on West Germany and is stepping up the nuclear armament of West German militarism. The United States is further strengthening its control over the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the Central Treaty Organization. The United States is stepping up its military provocations against our country. All of this further proves that U.S. imperialism is continuing to employ double-dealing tactics, continuing to use the guise of "peace" to wash away its guilt of sabotaging the four-power summit conference, and covering up its activities of further aggression and expansion. This is worthy of high vigilance by the people of the world.
    The aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism are irrefutable and cannot be denied in any way. The Tito clique deliberately distorts the facts, confuses right and wrong, and defends its American master. It said that the Soviet Union's shooting down of the American spy plane was "an unfortunate action," and it described the Soviet Union's and the world people's condemnation of the U.S. government as "disrupting the international atmosphere." The Tito clique also shamelessly whitewashed U.S. imperialism and its chieftain Eisenhower, saying that "Eisenhower has more than once advocated maintaining peace," saying that "sympathy has turned to Eisenhower," and clamoring that the responsibility for sabotaging the four-power summit conference should not be pursued, otherwise it would commit "an unforgivable mistake." What a despicable slave face! The Tito clique's doing so not only cannot help U.S. imperialism and its chieftain Eisenhower, but once again exposes that the Tito clique is completely the most loyal running dog of U.S. imperialism.
    The nature of U.S. imperialism will never change. U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world, and it is also the best teacher by negative example for the people of the world. It uses its own aggressive actions to continuously promote the awakening and unity of the people of the world. The storm of struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs is rising and expanding. The united front of the people of the world against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs is developing. The result of U.S. imperialism's insistence on the policy of war and aggression can only lead to the opposite of its wishes. Comrade Mao Zedong said, "The life of imperialism will not be long. They have done all kinds of bad things, and the oppressed people of the world will never forgive them." This is the inevitable law of historical development, and it is something that no force can change.
    Our socialist camp has always adhered to a peaceful foreign policy and advocated peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. International disputes should be resolved through negotiations instead of resorting to force. Our position is firm and unwavering. However, countless experiences tell us that the achievement of world peace must mainly rely on the struggle of the world's people, and we must not have unrealistic illusions about imperialism. The Chinese people resolutely support Comrade Khrushchev's statement in Paris on May 16, and resolutely support the Soviet people's just struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression and provocation. The Chinese people have launched an unprecedented mass demonstration in support of the Soviet Union and against U.S. aggression. More than 50 million urban and rural people participated in this demonstration. The Chinese people will always stand together with the great Soviet people, with the people of socialist countries, and with all peace-loving people in the world to carry out an unremitting struggle against imperialist aggression and to safeguard world peace. The Chinese people resolutely support the national democratic struggles of the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries. The Chinese people resolutely support the heroic struggle of the Japanese people to demand the dissolution of the Diet, overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke government, and smash the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. The Chinese people resolutely support the struggle of the South Korean people and the Turkish people against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. The Chinese people resolutely support all struggles of oppressed nations and oppressed people for liberation. The people are the decisive factor in historical development. Only by relying on the unity and struggle of the people of the world, only by closely combining the struggle for world peace with the struggle for national liberation, democratic freedom, and socialism, can we effectively prevent imperialist war and aggression activities and achieve lasting world peace.
    China and Albania are close brothers in the socialist family. Our friendship is built on the common ideological foundation of Marxism-Leninism and is unbreakable. For more than ten years, our two countries have been supporting each other and cooperating in a friendly manner. We sincerely thank the Albanian people for their support to the Chinese people. We have always regarded supporting the Albanian people as our own internationalist obligation. We firmly believe that the friendship between the people of our two countries will continue to be consolidated and developed. Let us join hands more closely, encourage each other, and advance victoriously towards our common goals.
    Long live the unbreakable friendship and unity between the Chinese and Albanian people!

    Long live the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

Long live the great solidarity of people worldwide!
    Long live world peace!

    中阿是社会主义大家庭的亲密兄弟
    彭真市长在北京各界欢迎列希主席大会上的讲话亲爱的哈奇·列希主席同志，亲爱的利丽·贝利绍娃同志，亲爱的阿尔巴尼亚贵宾们，同志们，朋友们：
    今天，我们首都各界人民能在这里欢迎我们的贵宾、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国人民议会主席团主席哈奇·列希同志、利丽·贝利绍娃同志和其他阿尔巴尼亚同志，感到十分高兴。我代表北京市全体人民向我们的贵宾们表示热烈的欢迎。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民是具有光荣革命传统的英雄人民。他们为了争取解放，曾同外国帝国主义和国内的反动统治者进行了长期的英勇斗争，终于取得了伟大的胜利。解放后，阿尔巴尼亚人民，在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，提出了“一手拿镐，一手拿枪”的豪迈口号，一面保卫自己的祖国，一面进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设。现在阿尔巴尼亚已经从一个落后的农业国变为一个社会主义的农业—工业国。1959年，阿尔巴尼亚的工业总产值比1938年增加了二十一倍。农业的社会主义改造也取得了决定性的胜利，合作化的土地面积已占全国耕地面积的83．2％，平原地区已全部合作化。文化教育事业蓬勃发展，全国四十岁以下的文盲已经消灭。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民在短短的历史时期内，取得了这样惊人的成就，雄辩地证明了马克思列宁主义战无不胜的伟大生命力和社会主义制度的无比优越性，证明了国家不论大小，也不论过去的经济基础强弱，一旦劳动人民掌握了政权，在马克思列宁主义政党的正确领导下，就一定能够创造出真正的奇迹，做出翻天复地的事业。中国人民为阿尔巴尼亚人民的这些成就而欢欣鼓舞。
    阿尔巴尼亚政府始终不渝地执行和平外交政策，坚决反对以美国为首的帝国主义集团的侵略政策和战争政策，支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族民主运动。特别是在维护巴尔干地区的和平方面，阿尔巴尼亚进行了巨大的努力，阿尔巴尼亚已经成为保障巴尔干地区和平的重要力量，受到了全世界爱好和平人民的普遍尊敬。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民一贯忠于无产阶级国际主义，坚决捍卫以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国之间的伟大团结。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和人民，为了保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，始终不渝地对南斯拉夫现代修正主义进行不调和的斗争。阿尔巴尼亚党和人民用大量的事实，无情地揭露了铁托集团背叛国际共产主义、充当美帝国主义走狗的丑恶面目，并且对他们的各种挑衅和破坏行为给了有力的回击。中国人民衷心地敬佩阿尔巴尼亚人民在反对现代修正主义斗争中所表现的高度的革命原则性和坚强的战斗意志。
    目前，全世界人民正面临着进一步揭穿美帝国主义的本质，反对它的侵略和战争政策，维护世界和平的迫切任务。美帝国主义在破坏了四国政府首脑会议以后，尽管还大谈所谓“和平努力”，表示愿意继续同苏联谈判，实际上却到处制造紧张局势，疯狂地加紧扩军备战。美国指使日本岸信介强行非法“通过”日美军事同盟条约。美国阴谋取消对西德的军备限制，加紧西德军国主义的核武装。美国正在进一步加强对北大西洋公约组织、东南亚条约组织、中央条约组织的控制。美国加紧对我国进行军事挑衅。所有这一切都进一步证明，美帝国主义正在继续施展两面手法，继续利用“和平”伪装，洗刷它破坏四国政府首脑会议的罪责，掩护它进一步侵略扩张的活动。这是值得全世界人民高度警惕的。
    美帝国主义的侵略罪行铁证如山，是怎样也抵赖不了的。铁托集团故意歪曲事实，混淆是非，为它的美国主子辩护。它说什么苏联击落美国间谍飞机是“一个不幸的行动”，它把苏联和全世界人民对美国政府的谴责说成是“扰乱国际气氛”。铁托集团还恬不知耻地为美帝国主义和它的头子艾森豪威尔擦粉，说“艾森豪威尔不止一次地主张维护和平”，说“同情已转向艾森豪威尔”，并且叫嚷不要追究破坏四国政府首脑会议的责任，否则就会犯“不可宽恕的错误”。这是一副多么卑鄙的奴才嘴脸！铁托集团这样做不仅帮不了美帝国主义和它的头子艾森豪威尔的忙，反而再一次暴露了铁托集团完全是美帝国主义的最忠实的走狗。
    美帝国主义的本质是绝对不会改变的。美帝国主义是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人，同时也是全世界人民最好的反面教员。它用自己的侵略行动，不断地促进全世界人民的觉悟和团结。反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争风暴正在兴起和扩大。全世界人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的统一战线正在发展。美帝国主义坚持战争和侵略政策的结果，只能走向他的愿望的反面。毛泽东同志说，“帝国主义的寿命不会很长了，他们做尽了坏事，全世界一切受压迫的人民决不会饶恕他们。”这是历史发展的必然规律，是任何力量也不能改变的。
    我们社会主义阵营一贯坚持和平的外交政策，主张不同社会制度的国家和平共处，应该通过谈判解决国际争端，而不诉诸武力。我们的这种立场是坚定不移的。但是，无数的经验告诉我们，世界和平的取得必须主要依靠世界人民的斗争，对于帝国主义不能抱有不切实际的幻想。中国人民坚决支持赫鲁晓夫同志5月16日在巴黎的声明，坚决支持苏联人民反对美帝国主义侵略和挑衅的正义斗争。中国人民发动了空前规模的支援苏联、反对美国侵略的群众示威，参加这个示威的城乡人民超过五千万以上。中国人民永远同伟大的苏联人民一起，同社会主义国家人民一起，同世界一切爱好和平的人民一起，为反对帝国主义侵略、维护世界和平进行坚持不懈的斗争。中国人民坚决支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民的民族民主斗争。中国人民坚决支持日本人民要求解散国会、打倒岸信介政府、粉碎日美军事同盟条约的英勇斗争。中国人民坚决支持南朝鲜人民和土耳其人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争。中国人民坚决支持一切被压迫民族、被压迫人民争取解放的斗争。人民是历史发展的决定因素，只有依靠世界人民的团结和斗争，只有把争取世界和平的斗争同争取民族解放、民主自由和社会主义的斗争密切结合起来，才能有效地制止帝国主义的战争和侵略活动，取得世界的持久和平。
    中国和阿尔巴尼亚是社会主义大家庭的亲密兄弟。我们的友谊是建立在马克思列宁主义的共同的思想基础上的，是牢不可破的。十年多来，我们两国一直互相支持，友好合作。我们衷心感谢阿尔巴尼亚人民对中国人民的支援。我们也一向把支援阿尔巴尼亚人民作为自己的国际主义义务。我们深信，我们两国人民之间的友谊将不断得到巩固和发展。让我们更加紧密地携起手来，互相鼓舞，向着我们共同的目标，胜利前进。
    中阿两国人民牢不可破的友谊和团结万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营大团结万岁！
    全世界人民大团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
