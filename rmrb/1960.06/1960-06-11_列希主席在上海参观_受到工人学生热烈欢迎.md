The workers and cadres in the factory welcomed the distinguished guests at the gate with flowers.

He introduced the various machines created and improved by the workers in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement to the distinguished guests. Chairman Lleshi inquired with concern about the workers' work and living conditions. In the assembly workshop, he also presented a commemorative medal of Albanian advanced women to a female worker in this workshop who had completed her task very well, and warmly wished her greater achievements in her work. Chairman Lleshi also viewed samples of fifteen kinds of gold pens produced by the factory.

Chairman Lleshi and others then visited the Shanghai Revolutionary History Memorial Hall – the site of the First National Congress of the Communist Party of China. At the end of the visit, Chairman Lleshi also wrote an inscription as a souvenir. The inscription said: "The Albanian people and our party are infinitely happy for the great victories achieved by the fraternal Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by Chairman Mao Zedong. Glory to the Communist Party of China! Long live the friendship between the people of our two countries and the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!"

Comrade Belishova and other distinguished guests, accompanied by Yang Xiguang, Minister of Education and Health of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPC, and Sun Lan, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, visited Shanghai Jiaotong University and Shanghai High School, carefully observed the achievements made by teachers and students of these two schools in carrying out scientific research and participating in productive labor in implementing the policy of combining education with productive labor, and visited various laboratories, practice workshops and electro-optical teaching equipment of the two schools. At Jiaotong University, Comrade Belishova was very pleased to see various experimental instruments researched and manufactured by teachers and students themselves, as well as various new locomotive models, ship models, new alloy steels, and complete sets of dynamic simulation equipment for measuring the operation and performance of power systems jointly designed with factories, and highly praised the achievements made by teachers and students. Xie Bangzhi, President of Jiaotong University, told her that students spend about one-fifth of their study time participating in industrial and agricultural productive labor. In addition, they spend a certain amount of time on scientific research. The school has established contacts with more than 100 factories and frequently helps factories carry out technical innovations and design and trial-produce new products. Through these practical activities, students have consolidated their knowledge and improved the quality of their learning. Belishova was very happy to hear this. At Shanghai High School, Comrade Belishova came to the classroom of the first grade, where students were attending a political class. She encouraged the students and said: "You should study Marxism-Leninism well. Without Marxism-Leninism, it is like a person without eyes."

Chairman Lleshi, Comrade Belishova, and other distinguished guests also visited the Shanghai Arts and Crafts Research Institute successively. The distinguished guests appreciated the various folk arts and crafts works such as lanterns, sculptures, velvet embroidery, and artificial flowers with great interest. The distinguished guests praised the artists' skillful techniques. Zhao Kuoming, a famous dough figurine artist, and He Keming, a lantern artist, performed their exquisite craftsmanship for the distinguished guests. Zhao Kuoming also presented the small dough figurine he had just made, called "Happy Children of the Mao Zedong Era," to Chairman Lleshi and Comrade Belishova. Belishova warmly shook his hand and said, "Your hands are so skillful!"

In the afternoon, the distinguished guests drove around the city and ascended the 17th floor of the Shanghai Mansion, overlooking the entire city of Shanghai.
