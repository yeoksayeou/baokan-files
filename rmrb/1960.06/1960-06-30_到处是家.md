    Home is Everywhere

    To the Editor:
    On June 12th, just as dawn was breaking, Zhai Jiarun, the leader of the eleventh production team's work group of the Greening Brigade of the Donggong People's Commune in Xupu, went to the fields to work. He had not gone far from his door when he found a four- or five-year-old girl crying loudly in a puddle. Zhai Jiarun quickly scooped the child up. The child only knew to cry and call for her mother, and couldn't say where she lived. None of the commune members in the team recognized whose child she was. Zhai Jiarun took the child to the production team's kindergarten and asked the auntie to take care of her. The enthusiastic auntie busily dried the child's clothes and put on new shoes. The child was so happy that she jumped and played with her friends.
    It turned out that this little girl's name was Dai Huanlian, and she was the daughter of He Tazhen, a member of the Liyan Brigade. On the morning of June 12th, when He Tazhen returned to her mother's home, her daughter secretly followed her out and later got lost. It wasn't until the afternoon of June 15th, when He Tazhen returned from her mother's home, that she discovered her daughter was missing. When she found her beloved daughter, she was so moved that she said, "With Chairman Mao and the People's Commune, home is truly everywhere."

    到处是家编辑同志：
    6月12日，天刚麻麻亮。溆浦人东公社绿化大队十一生产队作业组组长翟家润就下地生产了。他刚走出门不远，发现一个四、五岁的小女孩在水坑里大哭。翟家润忙把小孩捞了上来。孩子只知道哭着喊妈妈，也说不出家住在那里。全组社员，也都认不出是谁家的小孩。翟家润把孩子送到生产队幼儿园，请阿姨照管。热情的阿姨忙给孩子烘干了衣服，换上了新鞋，孩子高兴得和小伙伴们一起跳着去玩了。
    原来这个小女孩名叫戴欢莲，是里岩大队队员何它贞的女儿。6月12日早晨，何它贞回娘家时，女儿悄悄跟在她背后走了出去，后来迷了路。直到6月15日下午，何它贞从娘家回来时，才发现女儿丢失了。她找到了心爱的女儿，感动得说：“有了毛主席，有了人民公社，真是到处是家。”
