Xinhua News Agency, 19th: Yang Mingxuan, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic League, said at the protest rally of various democratic parties against Eisenhower's "visit" to Taiwan on the 18th that Eisenhower, the archenemy of the people of Asia and the world, the number one lackey of the American monopoly capital group, and a war monger, began his "Far East trip" when the people of the world exposed his nature of false peace and true war preparations and was in unprecedented isolation. He plans to further collude with the reactionary rulers of the Philippines, Japan, South Korea, and even our territory of Taiwan to suppress the patriotic and righteous struggles of the people that are constantly rising in these regions, support the puppet regimes he has fostered, maintain the aggressive front of American imperialism in the Far East, and step up war preparations in an attempt to realize his consistent aggressive conspiracy against the Soviet Union, China, other socialist countries in Asia, and nationally independent countries.

He said that American imperialism has never been reconciled to its defeat in the Korean War. For ten years, it has adopted an aggressive policy of continuing to be enemies with the Chinese people, the Korean people, and the people of Asian countries. Ten years ago, American imperialism launched the Korean War and occupied our territory of Taiwan. In the Asian region, it pieced together aggressive military blocs, established military bases everywhere, interfered in the Indochina War, signed the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, rearmed Japan, and signed the so-called U.S.-Chiang "common defense treaty," and occupied our territory of Taiwan. These sinful activities of American imperialism have made the situation in the Asian region increasingly tense. It was only through the joint combat of the Chinese and Korean people and the joint efforts of the people of Asian countries that the aggressive flames of American imperialism in Korea were curbed.

Yang Mingxuan said that American imperialism has occupied our territory of Taiwan for ten years. The U.S. Navy's Seventh Fleet has been conducting war threats in the Taiwan Strait and along our coast for a long time. In the past two years, it has violated our territorial waters and airspace, and China has issued serious warnings as many as one hundred and nine times. In order to completely turn Taiwan into its colony, American imperialism has also been constantly carrying out conspiracies to create "two Chinas" in an attempt to occupy Taiwan for a long time. However, this conspiracy of American imperialism will forever be a dream. The Chinese people must drive American imperialism out of our territory of Taiwan.

He said that this time Eisenhower came to the Far East to plot new aggressive wars, interfere in the internal affairs of Asian countries, and the sinful activities of being enemies with the people of Asian countries have stirred up a wave of anger against resistance from the people of various countries. In recent days, the anti-imperialist struggles of the people of Asian countries have had new developments. In the face of the increasingly fierce anti-American and anti-Kishi Nobusuke struggle of the Japanese people, the Kishi Nobusuke government was forced to announce an indefinite postponement of Eisenhower's "visit" to Japan. This is a victory for the Japanese people and the result of the Japanese people's unyielding persistence in struggle. This victory of the Japanese people will naturally further inspire the fighting spirit of the Japanese people and the people of Asian countries, and will set off a greater patriotic and righteous struggle.

He said that Eisenhower's "Far East trip" is precisely a plan by American imperialism to intensify the tense situation in Asia and further deploy a war plan with Japan as the backbone. The people of Asian countries must be highly vigilant. The Chinese people, together with the peace-loving people of the world, resolutely support the just struggle of the Japanese people and the people of Asian countries. The sinister conspiracy of American imperialism to support its puppets in various countries in the Far East, organize aggressive fronts, and threaten Asian peace is doomed to failure.

Yang Mingxuan said that the Message to Compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu issued by the Fujian Front Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army completely represents the aspirations of the entire Chinese people. It expresses concern for the compatriots in Taiwan and hatred for American imperialism. The sound of ten thousand cannons on the mainland of the motherland is a head-on blow to the head of American imperialist aggression, a boost to the compatriots in Taiwan who are engaged in a struggle with American imperialism, and a contempt and disdain for American imperialism. Our Democratic League resolutely supports the armed demonstration of the Fujian Front against American imperialism. We will, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely oppose American imperialism's aggression against Taiwan, and resolutely drive American imperialism out. We must liberate Taiwan, and we will surely be able to liberate Taiwan!

    中国民主同盟副主席杨明轩讲话
    坚决把美帝国主义从台湾赶出去
    新华社19日讯　中国民主同盟副主席杨明轩，18日在各民主党派反对艾森豪威尔“访问”台湾的抗议集会上说，亚洲和世界人民的死敌、美国垄断资本集团的头号奴才、战争贩子艾森豪威尔，在世界人民揭穿了他的假和平、真备战的本质，陷于空前孤立的时候，开始了“远东之行”。他计划到菲律宾、日本、南朝鲜甚至我国领土台湾等地区，与这些地区的反动统治者进一步勾结，压制人民正在不断高涨的爱国正义斗争，扶植他所豢养的傀儡政权，维护美帝国主义在远东的侵略阵线，加紧战争准备，妄图实现其对苏联、中国、亚洲其他社会主义国家和民族独立国家的一贯的侵略阴谋。
    他说，美帝国主义一直不甘心它在侵朝战争中的失败。十年来采取了继续与中国人民、朝鲜人民和亚洲各国人民为敌的侵略政策。十年前美帝国主义发动了侵朝战争，侵占了我国领土台湾。在亚洲地区又拼凑侵略军事集团，到处建立军事基地，干涉印度支那战争，订立日美军事同盟条约，重新武装日本，订立所谓美蒋“共同防御条约”，霸占我国领土台湾。美帝国主义这些罪恶活动，使亚洲地区的局势日益紧张。由于中朝人民的并肩作战，和亚洲各国人民的共同努力，才遏止了美帝国主义在朝鲜的侵略凶焰。
    杨明轩说，美帝国主义侵占我国领土台湾十年了。美国海军第七舰队长期在台湾海峡及我国沿海，进行战争威胁。两年来侵犯我国领海领空，我国提出严重警告达一百零九次之多。为了想把台湾完全沦为它的殖民地，美帝国主义还不断进行制造“两个中国”的阴谋活动，企图长期霸占台湾。但是，美帝国主义的这一阴谋永远是一个梦想。中国人民一定要把美帝国主义从我国领土台湾赶出去。
    他说，这次艾森豪威尔到远东来策划新的侵略战争，干涉亚洲各国内政，与亚洲各国人民为敌的罪恶活动，掀起了各国人民反抗的怒潮。最近几天来，亚洲各国人民反帝斗争又有新的发展。岸信介政府在日本人民的更加炽烈的反美反岸信介斗争中，被迫宣布要艾森豪威尔无限期延期“访问”日本。这是日本人民的一个胜利，是日本人民不屈不挠坚持斗争的结果。日本人民的这一胜利，自然更加激励了日本人民和亚洲各国人民的斗志，将掀起更大的爱国正义斗争。
    他说，艾森豪威尔“远东之行”，正是美帝国主义加剧亚洲紧张局势，进一步布置以日本为骨干的战争计划。亚洲各国人民必须引起严重的警惕。中国人民同全世界爱好和平的人民一起，坚决支持日本人民和亚洲各国人民的正义斗争。美帝国主义扶植它在远东各国的傀儡，组织侵略阵线，威胁亚洲和平的罪恶阴谋是注定要失败的。
    杨明轩说，中国人民解放军福建前线司令部发表的告台、澎、金、马军民同胞书，完全代表了全中国人民的心意，它表示了对台湾同胞的关怀，对美帝国主义的愤恨。祖国大陆上的万炮齐鸣，是给美帝国主义侵略头子的当头一棒，是给正在和美帝国主义展开斗争的台湾同胞壮大声势，是对美帝国主义的蔑视和鄙视。我们民主同盟坚决支持福建前线对美帝国主义的武装示威，我们将和全国人民一道，坚决反对美帝国主义侵略台湾，坚决把美帝国主义赶出去，我们一定要解放台湾，一定能够解放台湾！
