Xinhua News Agency, June 5th: Xu Bing, Deputy Minister of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, stated at today's National Conference of Outstanding Workers in Culture and Education that the continuous great leap forward in socialist construction, the widespread development of people's communes in urban and rural areas, and the unprecedented consolidation of the people's democratic dictatorship have brought about new and profound changes in the balance of class forces in our country. The people's democratic united front led by the Chinese Communist Party and based on the worker-peasant alliance is more consolidated and developed than ever before. The people of the whole country have formed an unprecedentedly solid unity.

Xu Bing's speech was titled "On the Transformation of Intellectuals." He said that the work on bourgeois intellectuals is an important aspect of the Party's united front work. Our Party has always attached importance to the role of intellectuals in revolution and construction. Over the past decade, the Party and the state have carried out the work of uniting, educating, and transforming bourgeois intellectuals, fully mobilizing their positive factors to serve the cause of socialism, and making great progress in their political outlook, ideological status, and professional level. The majority of them have taken a big step forward in the process of transforming from bourgeois intellectuals to working-class intellectuals. However, Xu Bing pointed out, this does not mean that all their problems have been solved. They also have a negative side. They have made great progress, but they still need to continue to transform themselves until they are transformed into working-class intellectuals who can wholeheartedly serve socialist construction and, furthermore, communist construction.

Xu Bing said that bourgeois intellectuals generally do not possess the means of production and are not direct exploiters, but most of them come from landlord, bourgeois, and upper-petty-bourgeois families and have received imperialist and bourgeois education. Bourgeois ideology is deeply rooted in their minds. After the liberation of the whole country, thanks to the Party's policy of uniting, educating, and transforming bourgeois intellectuals, a part of the bourgeois intellectuals did accept the Party's socialist transformation policy, recognized the future, transformed themselves, and transformed into working-class intellectuals. But this is only a part. A considerable part of the bourgeois intellectuals have also accepted the leadership of the Party and have made progress to varying degrees in socialist transformation and socialist construction. However, because the roots of their bourgeois ideology are very deep and their bourgeois political stance has not fundamentally changed, they still retain a bourgeois worldview, have strong individualism, regard knowledge as private property, look down on the masses, are divorced from reality, favor the past over the present, and favor the foreign over the Chinese. These are objective realities. We must recognize the reality in order to transform this reality.

Xu Bing then explained the basic ways and methods of transforming intellectuals. He pointed out that the fundamental transformation of bourgeois intellectuals is a tortuous, complex, and arduous long-term process. Helping intellectuals to carry out self-transformation must be guided by Mao Zedong Thought and adhere to putting politics in command; resolutely follow the mass line; the basic way of transformation is the combination of practice and learning, and the basic method of transformation is the method of persuasion and education and criticism and self-criticism.

Xu Bing said that studying Mao Zedong Thought is of decisive significance for helping bourgeois intellectuals to carry out self-transformation. Mao Zedong Thought combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution and further develops Marxism-Leninism. It has been and will be the guide for all the Party's policies and work. Studying Mao Zedong Thought should be linked to reality, transform thinking, and break with the bourgeois standpoint, bourgeois idealism, and individualism. Only by earnestly studying Mao Zedong Thought can we correctly understand and master the Party's policies and do our work well.

Xu Bing said that in the process of self-transformation, bourgeois intellectuals must participate in production practice and carry out labor training. This is an effective way to realize the laborization of intellectuals, promote the combination of theory and practice, and the combination of intellectuals and the working masses. As long as you go into practice and go to the masses, you will gain something. And the size of the gain is directly proportional to the degree of going deep into practice and deep into the masses. If bourgeois intellectuals want to truly go deep into practice and deep into the masses, first, they must put down their airs, humbly learn from the working people, treat people equally, and appear as ordinary laborers. Second, don't worry about your own face, don't be afraid to expose your weaknesses, and abandon the bourgeois individualistic vanity. Third, jump out of the "literature" frame, break superstitions, take practice as the standard, enrich knowledge and exercise ability in practice. Regardless of participation in production practice and labor training, we should continue to adhere to the principle of consciousness, voluntariness, and doing what we can. We must adopt a variety of forms and combine them with business as much as possible.

Xu Bing said that the method of criticism and self-criticism is the basic method of self-education and self-transformation. After several years of study, criticism and self-criticism have been promoted among bourgeois intellectuals. This is a welcome thing. In helping bourgeois intellectuals to carry out self-transformation, we should continue to implement the spirit of persuasion and education, adhering to the formula of unity—criticism—unity, adopting the method of gentle breeze and drizzle, inspiring consciousness, exposing contradictions, and resolving contradictions. Continue to implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" in the academic and literary fields. Promote free debate among different schools and different opinions, and promote free competition among different forms and different styles.

Xu Bing said that in recent years, the democratic parties have done a lot of work under the leadership of the Party, and they have made great progress. They have played a positive role in political consultation, various political movements, as well as in leading their members to carry out self-education and self-transformation, and in socialist construction. This is helpful to the Party's work of uniting, educating, and transforming bourgeois intellectuals. In the future, the democratic parties should further promote their members and the masses they are in contact with to carry out ideological transformation, do a good job, and contribute more to socialist construction in accordance with the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision.

Xu Bing finally said that now, the technical revolution, the cultural revolution, and the urban people's commune movement are developing in depth, which cannot but impact the bourgeois political stance, world outlook, and way of life. This raises a question: Should we stand on the side of the revolutionary mass movement, love and promote the development of new things? Or should we stand on the opposite side of the movement and maintain the old things that will be eliminated? Or should we hesitate and waver between the two? Should we wholeheartedly care for the interests of the country, the people, and future generations? Or should we only care about personal interests? The essence of this question is where to go between the socialist road and the capitalist road. Xu Bing asked all intellectuals to lean to one side, to think for the country and the people, to think about realizing socialism and communism in our country, and that personal interests should be subordinate to overall interests, and should not put personal interests above overall interests. He said that this is the fundamental principle of socialism and the criterion for our work, study, and life.

    一心一意为社会主义建设
    徐冰在文教群英会上作“关于知识分子的改造问题”的报告
    新华社5日讯　中共中央统战部副部长徐冰在今天举行的全国文教先进工作者代表大会上讲话说，社会主义建设持续大跃进，城乡人民公社普遍大发展，人民民主专政空前巩固，使我国阶级力量的对比发生了新的深刻的变化，中国共产党领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主统一战线比过去任何时候都更加巩固，更加发展了，全国人民形成了空前牢固的大团结。
    徐冰的讲话，题目是“关于知识分子的改造问题”。他说，对资产阶级知识分子的工作，是党的统一战线工作的一个重要方面。我们党一贯重视知识分子在革命和建设中的作用。十年来，党和国家对资产阶级知识分子进行了团结、教育和改造工作，充分调动了他们的积极因素为社会主义事业服务，使他们的政治面貌、思想状况和业务水平，都大有进步。他们中的大多数人在由资产阶级知识分子到工人阶级知识分子的改造过程中，已经前进了一大步。但是，徐冰指出，这并不是说他们一切问题都已经解决了。他们还有消极的一面。他们有很大进步，但还需要继续改造，直到把他们改造成为工人阶级知识分子，能够一心一意地为社会主义建设并且进而为共产主义建设服务。
    徐冰说，资产阶级知识分子一般不占有生产资料，不是直接剥削者，但是他们大都是地主阶级、资产阶级和上层小资产阶级的家庭出身，都是受的帝国主义和资产阶级的教育，资产阶级思想意识在他们的头脑里是根深蒂固的。全国解放以后，由于党对资产阶级知识分子采取了团结、教育、改造的政策，资产阶级知识分子中的一部分的确接受了党的社会主义改造政策，认清了前途，改造了自己，转化成为工人阶级的知识分子。但这只是一部分。另有相当多的一部分资产阶级知识分子虽然也接受了党的领导，在社会主义改造和社会主义建设中也有不同程度的进步。但由于他们的资产阶级思想的根子很深，资产阶级的政治立场还没有根本改变，他们仍然保留着资产阶级的世界观，有浓厚的个人主义，把知识视为私有，看不起群众，脱离实际，厚古薄今，厚外薄中。这些都是客观的现实。应该承认现实，才能改造这个现实。
    徐冰接着就知识分子改造的基本途径和方法作了说明。他指出，资产阶级知识分子的根本改造是一个曲折的、复杂的、艰苦的长期过程，帮助知识分子进行自我改造，必须以毛泽东思想为指导，坚持政治挂帅；坚决走群众路线；改造的基本途径就是实践和学习相结合、改造的基本方法是说服教育和批评、自我批评的方法。
    徐冰说，学习毛泽东思想，对于帮助资产阶级知识分子进行自我改造有决定性的意义。毛泽东思想是把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命实践结合起来，并进一步发展了马克思列宁主义。它在过去和今后都是党的各项政策和工作的指针。学习毛泽东思想要联系实际、改造思想，破资产阶级立场、破资产阶级唯心主义和个人主义。只有认真地学习毛泽东思想，才能正确地领会和掌握党的政策，才能做好工作。
    徐冰说，资产阶级知识分子在自我改造的过程中，必须参加生产实践，进行劳动锻炼。这是实现知识分子劳动化、促进理论和实际相结合、知识分子和劳动群众相结合的有效方法。只要到实际中去，到群众中去，就有收获。而收获的大小又和深入实际、深入群众的程度成正比例。资产阶级知识分子要真正深入实际，深入群众，第一必需放下架子，虚心向劳动人民学习，平等待人，以普通劳动者的面目出现。第二，不要顾虑自己的面子，不怕暴露自己的弱点，丢掉资产阶级个人主义的虚荣心。第三，要跳出“文献”的框子，破除迷信，以实践为标准，在实践中丰富知识，锻炼能力。无论参加生产实践和劳动锻炼，都应当继续本着自觉自愿和力所能及的原则。要采取多种多样的形式，并尽可能和业务结合起来。
    徐冰说，批评和自我批评的方法，是自我教育和自我改造的基本方法。经过几年来的学习，批评和自我批评已经在资产阶级知识分子当中推行开了。这是一件值得欢迎的事。我们在帮助资产阶级知识分子进行自我改造中，应当继续贯彻说服教育的精神，本着团结—批评—团结的公式，采取和风细雨的方法，启发自觉，揭露矛盾，解决矛盾。在学术和文艺领域内继续贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针。促进不同学派、不同见解的自由争论，促进不同形式、不同风格的自由竞赛。
    徐冰说，这些年来，各民主党派在党的领导下做了很多工作，它们大有进步。它们在政治协商、历次政治运动，以及领导它们的成员进行自我教育和自我改造和在社会主义建设中，都发挥了积极的作用。这对于党团结、教育、改造资产阶级知识分子的工作是有帮助的。今后各民主党派还应该根据长期共存、互相监督的方针，进一步推动它们的成员和所联系的群众，进行思想改造，作好工作，为社会主义建设贡献更多的力量。
    徐冰最后说，现在，技术革命、文化革命和城市人民公社运动正在深入发展，不能不使资产阶级的政治立场、世界观和生活方式又受到冲击。这就提出了一个问题：是站在革命的群众运动方面，热爱和促进新事物的发展呢？还是站在运动的对面，维护将被消灭的旧事物呢？或者是徘徊犹豫，动摇于两者之间呢？是一心一意顾国家、顾人民和后代的利益呢？还是只顾个人利益呢？这个问题的实质，就是在社会主义道路和资本主义道路之间何去何从的问题。徐冰要求所有知识分子要顾一头、一边倒，要为国家和人民着想，为在我国实现社会主义和共产主义着想，个人利益应当服从整体利益，而不应当把个人利益摆在整体利益之上。他说，这是社会主义的根本原则，也是我们工作、学习和生活的准则。
