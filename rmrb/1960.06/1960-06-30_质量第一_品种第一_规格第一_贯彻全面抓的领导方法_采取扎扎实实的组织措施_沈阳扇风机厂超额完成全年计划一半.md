Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, June 29th: The Shenyang Fan Factory has achieved a great leap forward in output, quality, and variety, and has completed more than half of the annual state plan ahead of schedule in all aspects. As of June 20, the output of eleven products, including blowers and ventilators, exceeded half of the annual plan; the quality of the factory's products reached 100% of the national standards, and the scrap rate of processed parts also dropped from 10% in the past to 0.07%; labor productivity exceeded the plan; and costs were reduced by 6.85% compared to last year.

The Shenyang Fan Factory's plan this year is to produce blowers and fans for the metallurgical, coal and other national economic sectors. Both the output and quality will be greatly improved compared to last year. Among them, the output of large-scale turbo blowers will increase three times. At the same time, new varieties will be added. According to the factory's labor force, key equipment capacity, and raw material supply, it is very difficult to complete the above tasks. However, due to the factory's adherence to putting politics in command and taking concrete measures, it finally overcame these difficulties.

In organizing and leading production, the factory's Party committee resolutely implemented the method of comprehensive management, paying particular attention to grasping the variety and quality of products. In every competition campaign, the factory regards variety and quality as the main content. Since the beginning of this year, the factory has resolutely implemented various inspection systems. In addition to implementing the first-piece inspection, flow inspection, and intermediate sampling inspection, for large or key components, measures such as inspection personnel following the production process and inspecting several times a day are also taken, and they closely cooperate with the workers to jointly ensure quality. The personnel of the factory's inspection department also launched a zero-defect competition to eliminate wrong inspections and missed inspections to ensure product quality.

While adhering to putting politics in command and launching mass movements, the factory's Party committee also took solid organizational measures according to the different situations in each period. From the beginning of the year to the present, the factory has successively organized eighteen battles to attack the key points of production, pushing production from one climax to another. In order to solve the problem of insufficient raw material supply and improve product quality, the Party committee led the design department to actively reform product design. Within four months, sixty-one old products were reformed; among them, thirty-one were put into production this year, which can save 150,000 man-hours and the equivalent of 43% of the steel required by the entire factory this year. The quality of the reformed products is also better than before. The Party committee also organized crane, tool, transportation and other auxiliary personnel to carry out the "good, fast, and proactive" competition to serve production. For example, crane workers changed the past situation of going to work at the same time as production workers, and went to work early to hoist and transport the parts to be produced, ensuring that production workers could start production as soon as they went to work; in the past, production workers went to the tool room to collect tools themselves, and sometimes waited in line for a long time. After the competition, the staff of the tool room visited the machine tools and delivered the tools to the workers, greatly reducing the non-production time of the workers. The living welfare department also turned the canteens in the dormitories into "restaurants", serving meals at any time; and organized service teams to serve in the workshops. Because the Party committee cares about the lives of the workers, the workers' enthusiasm has always been very strong.

Since the beginning of this year, the factory's leading cadres have frequently gone deep into the front line of production to strengthen the leadership of production. Comrade Yang Zhongli, a member of the factory's Party committee, went to the second workshop, which had the worst completion of production tasks in May, to help the workshop and section cadres implement the leadership method of grasping three times a day (grasping the plan in the morning, grasping the inspection at noon, and grasping the evaluation and preparation for the next day in the evening), and mobilized all the workers in the workshop to carry out various competition activities. As a result, the May plan was successfully completed. The factory's leading cadres matched the advanced technology of machine tools into a complete set and vigorously promoted it, so that all the machine tools in the factory realized "multi-treasure machine tools," increasing the efficiency of each machine tool by one to four times. In June, the leading cadres who went deep into the front line of production also wrote twenty-three special investigation materials on the new experiences and new problems that appeared in the current production, which played a great role in deeply implementing the Party's instructions, changing the leadership style, and promoting the development of production.

### 质量第一　品种第一　规格第一  贯彻全面抓的领导方法　采取扎扎实实的组织措施  沈阳扇风机厂超额完成全年计划一半

    质量第一　品种第一　规格第一
    贯彻全面抓的领导方法　采取扎扎实实的组织措施
    沈阳扇风机厂超额完成全年计划一半
    新华社沈阳29日电　沈阳扇风机厂的产量、质量、品种齐跃进，提前全面超额完成了全年国家计划的一半。到6月20日止，这个厂生产的鼓风机和通风机等十一种产品的产量，都超额完成了全年计划的一半以上；出厂产品的质量100％地达到了国家标准，加工件废品率也由过去的10％降到了0．07％；劳动生产率超额完成了计划；成本比去年降低了6．85％。
    沈阳扇风机厂今年计划为冶金、煤炭等国民经济部门生产的鼓风机和扇风机，产量和质量都比去年大为提高，其中大型透平鼓风机产量增加了三倍；同时还要增加新的品种。按照这个厂的劳动力，关键设备能力和原材料供应情况，完成以上任务有很大困难。但由于这个厂坚持政治挂帅，采取了具体措施，终于战胜了这些困难。
    这个厂党委在组织领导生产中，坚决贯彻了全面抓的方法，特别注意了抓产品的品种和质量。每次竞赛运动，这个厂都把品种、质量作为主要内容。今年以来，这个厂坚决贯彻了各种检验制度，除了实行首件检查、流动检查、中间抽查外，对大型或关键部件，还采取了检查人员跟班生产、一天检查几次的办法，并和工人密切合作，共同保证质量。这个厂的检查部门人员还展开了无废品竞赛，消灭错检、漏查，来确保产品质量。
    这个厂党委在坚持政治挂帅大搞群众运动的同时，还根据各个时期的不同情况，采取了扎扎实实的组织措施。从年初到现在，全厂先后组织了十八次攻打生产关键的战役，使生产从一个高潮引向了另一个高潮。为了解决原材料供应不足和提高产品质量的问题，党委领导设计部门积极改革产品设计，四个月内就改革老产品六十一种；其中今年投入生产的三十一种，全年可节省十五万个工时和相当于今年全厂所需的43％的钢材，经过改革的产品质量也比以前更好了。党委还组织吊车、工具、运输等各种辅助人员开展了“好、快、一主动”的为生产服务的竞赛。例如吊车工改变了过去同生产工人同时上班的情况，提前上班把要生产的零件吊运好，保证生产工人一上班就能开始生产；过去生产工人自己到工具室领刀具，有时排队等很长时间，竞赛后，工具室工作人员到机床上访问，把刀具送到工人手里，大大减少了工人非生产时间。生活福利部门也把宿舍中的食堂办成了“饭馆化”，随到随吃；并组织服务队到车间服务。由于党委关心职工生活，因此，职工们的干劲始终都很旺盛。
    这个厂的领导干部，今年以来经常深入生产第一线，加强对生产的领导。工厂党委委员杨忠礼同志5月份深入到生产任务完成得最差的第二车间帮助车间、工段干部实行了一日三抓的领导方法（早晨抓计划，中午抓检查，晚上抓评比和第二天准备），并发动全车间职工开展了各种竞赛活动，结果胜利地完成了5月份计划。全厂的领导干部把机床方面的先进技术配套成龙，大力推广，使全厂所有的机床都实现了“多宝机床”，使每台机床提高效率一到四倍。6月份，深入生产第一线的领导干部，还就当前生产中出现的新经验和新问题，写出了二十三篇专题调查材料，对深入贯彻执行党的指示，转变领导作风促进生产的发展，起了很大作用。
