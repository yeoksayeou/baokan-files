Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, June 27th: The Myanmar "Pioneer" published an editorial today on the upcoming Sino-Myanmar Joint Boundary Committee meeting, saying, "At this auspicious moment, we wish the Sino-Myanmar talks success."

The newspaper pointed out, "The independent Union of Burma and the People's Republic of China must recognize that the Sino-Myanmar border dispute is a problem left over by the British imperialists." "The reason the two countries have been able to reach a solution to the border issue is because neither has forgotten the suffering they endured as victims of imperialist aggression, and both sides consider the border issue with sympathy."

The newspaper concluded, "If the talks that begin today are successful, we will be able to see a clearly defined border, agreed upon by both sides, on the maps of China and Myanmar. If this is the case, then there will be nothing to disturb our thoughts. We look forward to the results of the talks with great pleasure."
