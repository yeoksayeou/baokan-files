Xinhua News Agency, 31st Dispatch from Stockholm: The Presidium of the World Peace Council held a two-day meeting on the 28th and 29th to discuss John Bernal's report "on the international situation formed by the breakdown of the summit conference and on the tasks of the worldwide movement to defend peace." The following participated in the discussion: Zheng Senyu (People's Republic of China), Cassanova (France), Mrs. Gordon (France), Virlman (German Democratic Republic), Blum (Belgium), Luchatto (Italy), Dick (Australia), Roberts (United States), Mutran (Lebanon), Marengo (Argentina), Wen Youzhang (Canada), Yage (France), Ehrenburg (Soviet Union).

Opinions were exchanged on the practical tasks of the peace movement in the recent period. A decision was passed to convene an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council in the first half of July this year.

Xinhua News Agency, 31st, Stockholm News: The Presidium of the World Peace Council issued the following statement at its closing meeting on the 29th:

Peace advocates in all countries have worked for a long time to achieve a summit conference. The people of all countries have been watching the meeting of government heads with concern. They placed great hopes on the Four Powers meeting. The collapse of this meeting has caused them deep disappointment and serious anxiety. In this situation, the World Peace Council calls on all peace advocates to act more resolutely to prevent the revival of the evil and dangerous cold war practices; people are convinced that summit negotiations must be quickly restored, and they must take action to create an environment that makes it possible.

The common struggle must be intensified to ensure that the Geneva Conference on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapon Tests achieves results as soon as possible, and that the United Nations Ten-Nation Committee reaches a preliminary agreement on supervised disarmament. The current situation highlights the simple principle consistently adhered to by the World Peace Council: no disarmament without supervision, no supervision without disarmament.

But to achieve this, they must understand the circumstances that led to the failure of the Paris Conference: The leader of the U.S. government declared that he would abandon the policy of mutual concession and reaffirm the position of strength;

The agreement with Adenauer nullified the progress made at the foreign ministers' meeting on the Berlin issue and the representation of the two Germanys;

A decision was made to include Japan and West Germany in the U.S. military base network;

In the days before the conference, the Central Treaty Organization countries and the North Atlantic Treaty countries held meetings and decided on new rearmament measures;

On the eve of the summit conference, the United States announced that it would resume nuclear weapons testing;

Most importantly, U.S. military reconnaissance planes intruded into Soviet airspace—this is a violation of national sovereignty and international law;

And on the very day the meeting opened, U.S. military headquarters in all countries with U.S. military airfields issued alerts.

The responsibility that the U.S. government and the General Staff should bear for their aggressive policies has been criticized by many prominent political figures in the United States itself. It was precisely because the U.S. government refused to condemn the U.S. reconnaissance plane's intrusion into Soviet airspace, thereby violating international law, that the meeting could not be held. Therefore, the U.S. government should bear full responsibility for the failure of the summit conference.

World public opinion, including American opinion, is deeply disturbed by the U.S. government's claim to have the right to send aircraft to violate the sovereignty of other countries. The people of all countries recognize the danger of such actions, which completely undermine the conditions necessary for fruitful negotiations, namely mutual trust. They must take action to force their governments to stop such behavior, because the U.S. government not only does not abandon this violation of national sovereignty, but attempts to further propose the "open skies" proposal as a measure to prevent sudden attacks. This proposal, which is not related to disarmament, aims to legalize espionage. These recent events once again illustrate that military bases on foreign territories endanger the security and independence of all countries and endanger world peace.

Since its establishment, the World Peace Council has consistently fought for peaceful coexistence between all countries, for a permanent ban on nuclear weapon tests, for universal disarmament, and for the settlement of various disputes dividing the world through consultation. It condemns all acts of force against the people's right to national sovereignty and independence, and it recognizes that imperialism, colonialism, and racism are grave dangers to peace.

We reaffirm the truth of these principles.

The people of all countries must exert a decisive influence on their governments. The will of the people of all countries will be stronger than the obstruction of those who seek to maintain international tension. The efforts of the people of all countries to achieve true national independence and eliminate military bases, their opposition to the arms race, the rearmament of West Germany, and the new U.S.-Japan military treaty, as well as the growing worldwide opposition to nuclear weapons, are all contributions to peace and should receive the full cooperation of all those dedicated to peace.

True to our principles, we appeal to all good people around the world to work together to prevent the resumption of the Cold War, to establish peaceful coexistence, to achieve disarmament, and to create conditions conducive to summit conferences.

We firmly believe that these goals can be achieved.
				Stockholm, May 29, 1960

    世界和平理事会主席团声明
    帝国主义是和平的严重危险
    各国人民为争取真正的民族独立和取消军事基地的努力，对军备竞赛、重新武装西德和新的美日军事条约的反对以及全世界反对核武器的行动，都是对和平的贡献
    新华社31日讯　据塔斯社斯德哥尔摩讯：世界和平理事会主席团28和29日举行了两天会议，讨论了约翰·贝尔纳“关于由于最高级会议破裂所形成的国际局势和关于全世界保卫和平运动的任务”的报告。参加讨论的有：郑森禹（中华人民共和国）、加桑诺瓦（法国）、戈登夫人（法国）、维尔曼（德意志民主共和国）、布吕姆（比利时）、卢查托（意大利）、狄克（澳大利亚）、罗伯茨（美国）、穆特兰（黎巴嫩）、马伦戈（阿根廷）、文幼章（加拿大）、雅格（法国）、爱伦堡（苏联）。
    就最近期间保卫和平运动的实际任务的问题交换了意见。通过了关于在今年7月上半月召开世界和平理事会常务委员会扩大会议的决定。
    新华社31日讯　斯德哥尔摩消息：世界和平理事会主席团在29日的闭幕会议上发表声明如下：
    世界各国的和平拥护者，为争取最高级会议的召开已作了很久的努力。各国人民关切地注视政府首脑会议。他们对四大国会议寄予很大的希望。这次会议的垮台使他们深感失望和严重不安。在这种情况下，世界和平理事会号召一切和平拥护者更坚决地行动起来，阻止邪恶的、危险的冷战做法的复活；人们深信，必须迅速恢复最高级谈判，他们必须采取行动来造成使它成为可能的环境。
    必须加紧共同的斗争，以保证日内瓦禁止核武器试验会议尽早取得结果，并保证联合国十国委员会就有监督的裁军达成初步协议。目前的情况更突出了世界和平理事会一贯坚持的简单原则：不要无监督的裁军，不要无裁军的监督。
    但是要达到这一点，他们必须了解导致巴黎会议失败的情况：美国政府的领导人宣称抛弃互让政策，重申实力地位；
    与阿登纳的协议勾消了在外长会议上对柏林问题和两个德国的代表问题上所取得的进展；
    决定将日本及西德包括在美国军事基地网里；
    在会议前几天，中央条约组织国家和北大西洋条约国家举行会议，决定了新的重新武装的措施；
    在最高级会议前夕，美国宣布要恢复核武器试验；
    最重要的是美国军事侦察飞机侵入苏联领空——这是违犯国家主权和国际法的；
    并且就在开会的那天，凡有美国军用机场的各国的美军司令部发布了警戒令。
    美国政府和参谋部对其侵略政策应负的责任，在美国本国内已受到许多著名的政治人物的抨击。就是由于美国政府拒绝谴责美国侦察飞机侵入苏联领空，从而违反了国际法，结果使会议不可能举行。因此，最高级会议失败的责任完全应由美国政府担负。
    世界各国舆论，包括美国的舆论，都因美国政府宣称有权派飞机侵犯其他国家主权而深感不安。各国人民都认识到这种行为的危险性，它完全破坏了为有成果的谈判所必须的条件，即互相信任。他们必须采取行动迫使他们的政府制止这种行为，因为美国政府不仅不放弃这种对各国主权的侵犯行为，反而企图进一步提出“开放天空”的建议作为预防突然袭击的措施。这个与裁军没有联系的建议，目的是要使间谍行为合法化。最近发生的这些事情再一次说明在外国领土上的军事基地危害各国的安全和独立并且危害世界和平。
    世界和平理事会自从它成立以来一贯为一切国家之间的和平共处、为永久禁止核武器试验、为普遍裁军、并为通过协商解决分裂世界的各种争端而斗争。它谴责了一切反对人民要求民族主权和独立的权利的武力行动，它并且认识到帝国主义、殖民主义和种族主义是对和平的严重危险。
    我们重申这些原则的真实性。
    各国人民要对政府起决定性的影响。各国人民的意志将比那些寻求保持国际紧张局势的人的阻挠更为坚强。各国人民为争取真正的民族独立和取消军事基地所作的努力，他们对军备竞赛、重新武装西德和新的美日军事条约的反对以及全世界日益壮大的反对核武器行动，都是对和平的贡献，应该得到一切献身于和平的人们的充分合作。
    我们忠于我们的原则，向全世界一切善良的人们发出呼吁，要求他们为防止冷战的恢复、为树立和平共处、为实现裁军以及为创造有利于大国会议的条件而共同努力。
    我们深信这些目标是能够实现的。
                                  1960年5月29日于斯德哥尔摩
