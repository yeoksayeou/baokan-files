Xinhua News Agency, Addis Ababa, 17th. The Second Conference of Independent African States, which opened on the 14th, held plenary sessions on the 15th and 16th.

According to the agenda adopted on the afternoon of the 15th, the most important issues discussed at the conference included the elimination of colonialism in Africa and the Algerian war. In addition, the conference will also discuss the situation in Southwest Africa, racial discrimination in Africa, and the conduct of nuclear tests on African territory.

Representatives from Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria, Liberia, and other countries spoke at the general assembly during these two days. Ghanaian representative, Foreign Minister Ako Adjei, condemned colonialism in Africa, the racial discrimination policies of the Union of South Africa, and the war of aggression launched by French colonialists in Algeria in his speech. He said that colonial countries are attempting to achieve their conspiracy to continue their rule over Africa through a policy of dividing the African continent. Therefore, he called on African countries to work hard to thwart the sinister plots of colonial countries.

Guinean representative, Minister of Rural Economy Diallo Abdoulaye Rahman, said in his speech, "All of us African brothers must mobilize to fully restore our freedom and dignity, which have long been deprived by those who practice racism and exploitation as the basis of their civilization." He condemned France's heinous policy of using Africans to fight Africans and demanded that all Africans support the struggle of the Algerian people, who are shedding blood for freedom, saying that the Algerians' struggle "is the struggle of all of us."

The Guinean representative requested at the meeting that all independent African countries establish a support fund for Algeria; withdraw all Africans from the French army invading Algeria; inform public opinion of France's atrocities in Algeria; and recognize the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria. It is reported that in order to discuss the relevant issues on the conference agenda, the conference established three committees: the Political and Security Committee, the Special Political Committee, and the Economic and Social Committee. The three committees are chaired by the three vice-chairmen of the conference—the Foreign Ministers of Ghana, Sudan, and Cameroon, respectively. The committee meetings will be held in secret.
