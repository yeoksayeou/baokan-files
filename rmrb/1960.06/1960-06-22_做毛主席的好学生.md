Worker-Peasant Essays Selection

    I am sixteen years old this year. I joined production after finishing junior primary school in 1956. In 1958, our commune launched a mass movement to study philosophy, and I actively signed up to participate at that time. Over the past two years, I have successively studied articles such as "On Practice," "On Contradiction," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire," "Concern Ourselves with the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Methods of Work," and "In Memory of Norman Bethune." I have also studied the Party's General Line, the "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning the People's Communes," and the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, in connection with various central movements.

    Studying Chairman Mao's works has been of great help to me. First, I understood that a person must establish a correct purpose in life. When I returned to the countryside from school, I also had the thought that being a farmer was "unpromising," complaining that I couldn't study or do work to let my parents enjoy a better life. After studying philosophy and discussing the establishment of a correct world outlook, and that a person's life should have a correct purpose, I understood more deeply that a person's work and study should not be for personal gain, but for socialist construction. Especially after studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," my heart seemed to have a light lit in it, becoming even brighter. I thought, Chairman Mao teaches us to be a noble person who is selfless and dedicated to helping others, but what about me? I am a rural person myself, yet I say the countryside is not good, and my purpose in studying is also to let my parents "enjoy a better life," without a clear plan to contribute to the country and the people. These do not conform to Chairman Mao's thought and must be completely changed. So, I wrote on my notebook: "Be a good student of Chairman Mao." Whenever I encountered difficulties, I would open it up and look at it, and the courage to overcome the difficulties would come.

    Second, it improved my ability to distinguish right from wrong. After communization, I heard a few people say things like: "The people's communes were established too early," "The people's communes waste labor," "Public canteens waste food," and so on. I felt that these words were a bit wrong, but I didn't have more reasons to refute them, and I also had some confused ideas on the issue of wasting food. Later, after studying Chairman Mao's saying that we should look at problems from a class viewpoint, look at the essence and the main trend of the problem, and distinguish the relationship between nine fingers and one finger, I clearly realized that the commune is the inevitable product of China's political and economic development, and the best organizational form for China's transition from socialism to communism. It has a strong vitality, which is the essence and main trend of the commune. As for wasting a little labor and food, that was caused by the shortcomings of a few cadres' work methods. These shortcomings can be quickly overcome. But why do some people say that the people's communes are not good? Who are these people? They are the landlords and rich peasants who are unwilling to honestly reform themselves and a few wavering well-to-do middle peasants. Landlords and rich peasants used to live off exploitation without labor, and of course they are not satisfied after liberation; a few wavering well-to-do middle peasants only value personal interests and are bent on getting rich individually, taking the capitalist road, and are also dissatisfied with the commune; individual poor peasants are influenced by bourgeois ideology, or are fooled by the people mentioned above, and echo their voices. After such an analysis, my mind became clearer, and I knew that the people who shouted that the people's communes were established too early were speaking on behalf of the interests of the landlords and rich peasants, and we must resolutely oppose this kind of argument.

    Third, it completely overthrew my feudal superstition. Like other rural girls, I was also afraid of ghosts. I didn't dare to walk alone at night, and I had to find a companion to go to evening school. After studying philosophy, I knew that this was idealism, a ghost trick deliberately created by the reactionary ruling class to rule the people. The transformation of my uncle, Wang Daosheng, is the best proof. Wang Daosheng has been singing Taoist scriptures for generations and is very famous in our area. After studying philosophy, he also realized the truth, smashed his own household gods and Buddhas, burned the perpetual calendar, and also talked everywhere about the secrets of his "divine manifestations," exposing his own trickery of deceiving people.

    After studying Chairman Mao's works, I took the initiative to publicize to the masses, mobilizing them to participate in the study as well. My father was originally not very understanding of my participation in the study, let alone studying himself. One day, he had a quarrel with my younger brother, the cause of which was that my father planted a tree in the vegetable garden, and my younger brother planted a patch of vegetables next to the tree. My younger brother wanted the vegetables to grow faster, but the vegetables kept failing to grow, and in a fit of anger, he dug up the tree. My father was very angry when he found out and beat my younger brother. My younger brother had attended philosophy class and asked my father: "I asked you to study philosophy, but you didn't want to, and you look at problems so one-sidedly; if you had studied dialectics, you wouldn't have beaten me." My father was surprised and asked him why? My younger brother said: "You only saw the tree you planted, and you didn't see that I planted vegetables to complete the school's task, and it was more urgent." I felt that what my younger brother said was not comprehensive enough, so I said to them: "Although my younger brother has studied philosophy, he has not learned dialectics well. If you want to look at the problem comprehensively, you must protect both the growth of the vegetables and the tree. But you, one only looks at the tree and not the vegetables, and the other only looks at the vegetables and not the tree, both are one-sided." My father felt that what I said made a lot of sense. From then on, he never said, "I'm over fifty years old, it's useless to study philosophy," and actively participated in the study as well.

    After studying philosophy, I also tried to use some of Chairman Mao's viewpoints to analyze the actual problems of the production team. Once, the production team leader sent two commune members to harvest two mu of paddy fields. They completed the task on time. The next day, he sent these two people to harvest another two mu of paddy fields. They did not complete the task. The team leader thought that they had a bad attitude towards labor and wanted to deduct their work points. This incident caused dissatisfaction among some commune members, who said that the reason they did not complete the task was not because of a bad attitude towards labor, but because the conditions of the paddy fields were different. The first day, the fields were dry, and the rice had not fallen; the second day, they were rotten muddy fields, and the rice had fallen. After I learned about this, I suggested to the team leader: specific problems should be analyzed specifically, and specific contradictions should be resolved specifically. At the same time, I told the commune members: we must give play to subjective initiative, and it is not right to only emphasize conditions. The team leader and the commune members both felt that what I said made sense, so the contradiction was resolved, and both sides were happy.

    Through two years of study, I have realized that the philosophy of Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works are indeed a "treasure box" and a compass for our progress. We young people should strive to arm ourselves with the philosophy of Marxism-Leninism and with Chairman Mao's thought.

    做毛主席的好学生
    湖北省罗田县城关公社女社员　丁凤英
    我今年十六岁，1956年读完初小后就参加了生产。1958年我们社开展了全民学哲学的运动，我当时就积极报名参加。两年来，我先后学习了“实践论”、“矛盾论”、“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”、“中国社会各阶级的分析”、“星星之火，可以燎原”、“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”、“纪念白求恩”等文章。还结合各项中心运动学习了党的总路线、“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”和八届八中全会文件。
    学习毛主席的著作对我的帮助太大了。第一，我懂得了一个人要树立正确的生活目的。我从学校回农村的时候，也有当农民“没出息”的思想，埋怨自己不能读书、做工作，叫父母享些福。学了哲学，讨论了树立正确的世界观，一个人生活要有正确的目的，我才比较深刻地懂得一个人工作、读书，不应该为个人的私利，要为社会主义建设着想。特别在学了“纪念白求恩”以后，我心里好像点了一盏灯一样更加明亮了。我想，毛主席教导我们要做一个毫不利己、专门利人的高尚的人，可是我呢？自己是个农村人，还说农村不好，自己读书的目的也是为了让父母“享福”，没有明确的为祖国为人民作贡献的打算。这些都不符合毛主席的思想，要彻底改变。于是我就在练习本上写着：“要做毛主席的好学生”。一遇到困难，就打开看看，克服困难的勇气就来了。
    第二，使我提高了辨别是非的能力。公社化以后，我听到少数人说什么：“人民公社搞早了”，“人民公社浪费劳力”，“公共食堂浪费粮食”，等等。我觉得这些话有点不对头，但是也没有更多的道理去反驳人家，而且在浪费粮食等问题上我也有些糊涂思想。后来学习了毛主席说的要用阶级观点看问题，要看问题的本质与主流，分清九个指头和一个指头的关系，我才明确地认识到公社是我国政治经济发展的必然产物，是我国由社会主义过渡到共产主义最好的组织形式，它有强大的生命力，这是公社的本质与主流。至于浪费一点劳力和粮食，那是少数干部工作方法有缺点造成的。这些缺点是可以很快克服的。可是为什么有人说人民公社不好呢？是些什么人呢？他们都是些不肯老老实实地改造自己的地主富农和少数动摇的富裕中农。地主富农过去不劳而获，过着剥削生活，解放后他们当然不满意；少数动摇的富裕中农只看重个人利益，一心想个人发财，走资本主义道路，对公社也不满；个别贫农受了资产阶级思想的影响，或者上了前面这些人的当，也随声附和。经过这样一分析，我的头脑更清楚了，知道了喊叫人民公社搞早了的人是代表地主富农利益说话的，一定要坚决反对这种论调。
    第三，彻底打倒了我的封建迷信思想。和别的农村女孩子一样，我也怕鬼。一个人夜晚不敢走路，上业余学校一定要找个伴。学习哲学后，我知道这是唯心主义，是反动统治阶级为了统治人民，故意制造的鬼把戏。我舅爷王道生的转变，就是最好的证据。王道生几代都唱道士，在我们那里很出名。经过学哲学，他也觉悟了，把自己的家神菩萨打了，万年历也烧了，还到处讲自己“显神”的秘密，自己揭穿了自己骗人的鬼把戏。
    我学习了毛主席的著作以后，就主动地向群众作宣传，动员他们也来参加学习。我的父亲原来对我参加学习思想不太通，更谈不上自己学了。有一天，他和我弟弟发生了争吵，起因是父亲在菜园里栽了一棵树，弟弟又在树旁种了一块菜，弟弟想叫菜快点长，可是菜老是长不起来，他一恼火就把树挖掉了。父亲知道以后很生气，打了弟弟。弟弟听过哲学课，就问父亲：“叫你学哲学你不愿意，看问题真片面；要是你学了辩证法，就不会打我了。”父亲感到奇怪，问他为什么？弟弟说：“你只看到你栽的树，没看到我种菜是为了完成学校的任务，还紧急些。”我觉得弟弟说的也不够全面，就对他们说：“弟弟虽然学了哲学，但是辩证法也没学好，你要是看问题全面，就既要保护菜的生长，也要把树保护好。可是你们一个只看树不看菜，一个只看菜不看树，都是片面性。”父亲觉得我讲得很有道理，从那以后，再也不说“我五十几岁，学哲学没有用”的话，并且也积极地参加了学习。
    学了哲学以后，我还试着用毛主席的一些观点去分析生产队的实际问题。有一次，生产队长派两个社员去割二亩稻谷田。他们按时完成了任务。第二天，他又派这两个人去割另外二亩田。他们却没有完成任务。队长认为是他们劳动态度不好，要扣他们的工分。这件事引起了一些社员的不满，说是他们所以没有完成任务，不是因为劳动态度不好，主要是稻田的条件不同。头一天，田里是干的，谷没有倒；第二天却是烂泥田，谷又倒了。我知道这件事后，就向队长建议：具体问题要具体分析，具体矛盾要具体解决。同时又向社员讲了：要发挥主观能动性，光强调条件也是不对的。队长和社员都感到我讲的有道理，于是矛盾解决了，双方面都痛快了。
    经过两年来的学习，我认识到马克思列宁主义的哲学、毛主席的著作确实是“万宝箱”，确实是我们前进的指南针，我们青年应该努力用马克思列宁主义的哲学、用毛主席的思想武装自己。
