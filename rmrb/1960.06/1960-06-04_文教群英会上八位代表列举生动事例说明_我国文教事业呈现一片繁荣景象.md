Xinhua News Agency, June 3rd: Eight representatives from various positions on the cultural and educational front, at today's National Cultural and Educational Advanced Workers Representative Conference, respectively introduced their outstanding achievements and advanced experiences in teaching reform, youth education, learning theory, scientific research, rural cultural work, and the movement to eliminate pests and diseases. The representatives' speeches vividly demonstrated that all departments of China's cultural and educational front are presenting a flourishing and prosperous scene, and the high tide of the cultural revolution has begun to take shape throughout the country.
	Jia Guizhi, a representative from Beiguan Elementary School in Heishan County, Liaoning Province, reported on the achievements made by their school in the teaching reform experiment of Chinese and Mathematics in four first and second grade classes, and introduced their preliminary experiences. Beiguan Elementary School in Heishan County learned from the experience of high-speed literacy in rural areas in Chinese teaching, combined with the characteristics of children, used the method of singing to learn characters and reading pictures, compiled literacy textbooks, and conducted experiments on intensive literacy. In the process of teaching reform experiments, they also used the experience of "knowledge classification" and implemented the method of "step-by-step realization of learning tasks." In order to meet these requirements, they changed the past "cramming" teaching method to intensive lectures and more practice, so as to give play to students' ability to think independently. As a result of these reforms, the second-grade pilot class, after three semesters and two months of study, has now reached the fourth-grade level in Chinese; arithmetic is also equivalent to the fourth-grade level. The first-grade pilot class, which started in the spring of this year, has completed the first-grade curriculum after more than two months of study. Jia Guizhi finally emphasized that according to the preliminary experimental results of their school, it proves that teaching must be reformed, and it is entirely possible to reform.
	Inaiti Yimin, a representative from Yili Women's Middle School in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, introduced in her speech that in recent years, under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line, following the Party's policy of education serving proletarian politics, combining education with productive labor, and the Party's leadership over education, she has continuously carried out political and ideological education work in a class she led. Now, the students in this class have continuously improved their socialist consciousness, studied with peace of mind, and achieved remarkable results, becoming one of the best classes in the school.
	Li Ruihuan, leader of the youth shock brigade of the carpentry team of the Third Construction Company of Beijing, gave a speech at the conference today entitled "Use Chairman Mao's Strategic Thinking to Fight Production Battles." After he took office as the leader of the shock brigade in the spring of 1958, he has always insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works such as "On Practice," "On Contradiction," and "The Strategic Issues of China's Revolutionary War," and he has been constantly thinking and improving his leadership, so the production tasks have always been overfulfilled. Carpentry work starts with laying out the pattern, which is the conventional method for thousands of years. Obviously, it wastes materials and labor, but carpenters say, "If you don't want to lay out the pattern, unless you are Master Luban." Li Ruihuan, who only has a fourth-grade education, after studying Chairman Mao's article "The Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountains," decided to "overthrow Master Luban" and eliminate "enlarging the pattern." Under the guidance of the Party, he was determined to learn culture and master weapons, and finally created a set of "simple carpentry calculation method" to replace enlarging the pattern. Li Ruihuan recalled these achievements excitedly today and said: "Chairman Mao's thought is the truth. Using Chairman Mao's strategic thinking to fight production battles and technical revolution battles will be invincible and unconquerable."
	"Dedicate everything to educating the next generation!" This is the determination expressed by Shen Shuzi, an excellent educator in the kindergarten of Liudong Management District, Dehua People's Commune, Helong County, Jilin Province, at today's conference.
	She said that when she started running a kindergarten at the age of sixteen, she encountered many difficulties in her work. The equipment was not good, the children were disobedient, and the parents were not at ease. Under the education of the Party and inspired by the determination to serve the children, she overcame all these difficulties. Shen Shuzi also cultivated the children's labor habits through various methods; seized every opportunity to carry out communist moral education for children. According to the children's desire for knowledge, she experimented with literacy and mathematics teaching in the kindergarten. After two years of experiments, the children in the senior class can generally count one hundred numbers, can recognize and write numbers within twenty, can calculate addition and subtraction within ten digits, can write and read all the initial alphabets, all the children can write their own names, and they have also composed more than forty children's songs. She finally expressed that she would redouble her efforts and contribute all her strength to the Party's preschool education.
	Ren Jizhou, a representative from the Feed Production Teaching and Research Group of Gansu Agricultural University, reported to the conference on the achievements and experiences gained by this teaching and research group in improving teaching quality and establishing new grassland science theories by implementing the Party's education policy.
	Ren Jizhou said that in the past few years, they have gone deep into practice and conducted on-site teaching, enabling students to acquire practical knowledge, improve teaching quality, and promote production.
	Ren Jizhou said that the Feed Production Teaching and Research Group also undertook the teaching of grassland science and the arduous task of establishing China's own grassland science. They waged a fierce struggle against the reactionary theory of "the livestock in the Northwest pastoral area of China has reached the saturation point" spread by American grassland scientists in the minds of some animal husbandry workers. They spent several years conducting grassland surveys in Gansu and Qinghai provinces, and the results proved that there is no shortage of feed in China's pastoral areas, but there is huge potential.
	Ren Jizhou said that through the combination of teaching, productive labor and scientific research, the quality of teaching has been greatly improved, 80% of the students have achieved excellent results, and the training tasks of undergraduate students and graduate students have been completed. Now they are vigorously carrying out systematic research work on various grassland types, especially grassland research work in desert areas where feed problems are very serious, striving to increase the production of more livestock.
	Zhang Huaiying, a representative from Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, vividly described the cultural prosperity of Xiyang, the "land of abundance and home of art," after the people's communes were established throughout the county. At present, the vast numbers of workers and peasants in the county are actively participating in literary and artistic creation activities, and new examples of grandfathers writing songs and grandsons composing music, wives cutting paper and husbands writing lyrics have emerged. Zhang Huaiying said that in the past two years, through more than forty kinds of activities such as exhibitions and slides, they have praised and promoted the "Three Great Banners" from various aspects, widely carried out socialist and communist education among the masses, and combined with the central work of various periods to promote the great leap forward in production.
	The achievement of Yujiang County, Jiangxi Province, in eliminating schistosomiasis mentioned by the great leader Chairman Mao in his brilliant poem "Farewell to the God of Plague" is well-known throughout the country. Yang Longxiang, a representative from this county, gave a speech at the conference today entitled "'The God of Plague' is Sent Away and the God of Fortune Arrives." He said that in the spring of 1956, with the arrival of the upsurge of cooperation and the promulgation of the forty articles of the Agricultural Development Program, the Yujiang County Party Committee put forward a grand plan to eradicate schistosomiasis within two years, and mobilized tens of thousands of people to participate in the battle to fill ditches, dig ponds, and eliminate snails. After two years of hard work, every patient with schistosomiasis has been treated and recovered their health, and most of them have become the main force in production. Since then, schistosomiasis, which has been prevalent in Yujiang County for many years, has been eradicated, the "God of Plague" has been sent away, and the people's long-cherished wish has been realized, becoming the first victorious red flag in the country to eradicate schistosomiasis.
	Yang Longxiang said that as of now, hookworm disease, filariasis, malaria, and venereal diseases have been basically eliminated throughout the county, effectively protecting the health of the people and promoting the development of production.
	Liu Fonian, a representative of the Curriculum Reform Committee of Shanghai Middle and Primary Schools, presented to the conference, on behalf of the committee, a complete set of middle and primary school textbooks that they had newly compiled, consisting of one hundred and sixteen volumes and eight million nine hundred and fifty thousand words. Liu Fonian said that the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China attached great importance to the work of curriculum reform. Taking East China Normal University as the base, it mobilized forces from various aspects of universities, middle schools, and primary schools. Thirteen curriculum reform committees were established in accordance with the middle and primary school curricula, and mass movements combining specialized organizations and mobilizing the masses were adopted to carry out curriculum reform. Hundreds of teachers and students from East China Normal University and members of the middle and primary school curriculum reform committees successively went to more than 300 units, including universities, middle schools, primary schools, factories, urban and rural people's communes, and scientific research institutions, to conduct investigations and research. They also visited advanced workers, experts, parents of students, and even kindergarten children, and held more than 1,000 forums and investigation meetings. Through such a wide-ranging and in-depth mass movement, they obtained a large amount of materials and opinions and compiled a complete set of teaching materials.

    文教群英会上八位代表列举生动事例说明
    我国文教事业呈现一片繁荣景象
    据新华社3日讯　来自文教战线各个不同岗位的八位代表，在今天举行的全国文教先进工作者代表大会上，分别介绍了他们在教学改革、青少年教育、学习理论、科学研究、农村文化工作和除害灭病运动等方面所创造的突出成就和先进经验。代表们的发言生动地显示：我国文教战线各个部门呈现出一片繁荣兴旺的景象，文化革命的高潮已在全国开始形成。
    辽宁省黑山县北关小学代表贾桂枝发言中，汇报了他们学校对一、二年级四个班进行语文、数学两科教学改革试验所取得的成绩，并介绍了他们的初步经验。黑山县北关小学在语文教学中学习农村高速度扫盲的经验结合儿童特点，用以歌带字和看图识字的办法，编写了识字课本，进行了集中识字的试验。他们在教学改革实验过程中，还运用了“知识归类”的经验，实行了“学习任务分步实现”的方法，并适应这些要求，将过去“填鸭式”的教学方法改为精讲多练，以发挥学生独立思考的能力。由于这些改革，二年级的试点班，经过三个学期零两个多月的学习，现在语文，已达到四年级程度；算术也相当于四年级程度。今年春季始业的一年级试点班，经过两个多月的学习，就学完了小学一年级的课程。贾桂枝最后强调说：根据他们学校的初步试验结果，证明教学必须改革，而且是完全可能改革的。
    新疆维吾尔自治区伊犁女子中学代表在以乃提·伊敏，在发言中介绍了几年来她在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，遵循着党的教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合、教育工作要由党来领导的方针，对她所领导的一个班级不断进行政治思想教育工作的情况。现在，这个班学生的社会主义觉悟不断提高，学习安心，成绩显著，成为全校最好的班级之一。
    北京市第三建筑公司木工青年突击队长李瑞环，今天以“用毛主席的战略思想打生产仗”为题在大会上发言。他在1958年春天担任突击队长后，就一直坚持学习“实践论”、“矛盾论”、“中国革命战争的战略问题”等毛主席著作，并且边学边想，不断改进领导工作，因此生产任务一直超额完成。木工做活先放样，这是千年的常规。明明费材料又费工，木工却说“要想不放样，除非鲁班师”。只有小学四年级文化程度的李瑞环，在学了毛主席的“愚公移山”文章后，决心要“革鲁班爷的命”，消灭“放大样”。他在党的教导下，决心学习文化、掌握武器，终于创造了一套“木工简易计算法”，并用它代替了放大样。李瑞环今天回忆着这些成就兴奋地说：毛主席的思想就是真理。用毛主席的战略思想打生产仗、打技术革命的仗，都会无往不胜，无攻不克。
    “为教养后一代献出自己的一切！”这是吉林省和龙县德化人民公社柳洞管理区幼儿园优秀的教养员申淑子在今天的大会上表示的决心。
    她说，当她从十六岁开始办幼儿园时，工作上碰到不少困难，设备不好，孩子们不听话，家长不放心。在党的教育下，在为孩子们服务的决心鼓舞下，她克服了这一切困难。申淑子还通过各种方式，培养孩子们的劳动习惯；抓住每一个时机向儿童进行共产主义道德教育。根据孩子们求知欲望，在幼儿园里试验了识字和数学教学，经过两年试验，大班孩子一般都能数一百个数，能认、写二十以内的数，能计算十位数以内的加减法，朝文字母全部会写会念，所有的孩子都会写自己的名字，还编了四十多首儿歌。她最后表示要鼓足更大的干劲，为党的幼儿教育事业贡献出一切力量。
    甘肃省农业大学饲料生产教研组代表任继周向大会汇报了这个教研组贯彻党的教育方针，在提高教学质量、建立新的草原学理论等方面所获得的成就和经验。
    任继周说，几年来，他们深入实际，现场教学，使学生获得了实际知识，提高了教学质量，促进了生产。
    任继周说，饲料生产教研组还担任了草原学教学，和建立我国自己的草原学的艰巨任务。他们和美国草原学家流传在某些畜牧工作者思想中的“中国西北牧区家畜已达饱和点”的反动理论，进行了激烈的斗争，他们花了几年的时间，在甘肃、青海两省进行了草原调查，结果证明，我国牧区不是饲料不足，而是有巨大潜力。
    任继周说，通过教学、生产劳动和科学研究三结合，大大提高了教学质量，80％的学生都达到了优良成绩，完成了本科学生和研究生的培养任务。现在他们正在大力开展各个草原类型上的系统研究工作，特别是饲料问题十分严重的沙漠地区的草原研究工作，争取增产更多的家畜。
    山西省昔阳县代表张怀英的发言，生动地描绘出了昔阳这个“丰产之乡、艺术之家”在全县人民公社化以后，呈现的一片文化繁荣的景象。目前全县广大工人和农民群众都积极参加文艺创作活动，出现了爷编歌孙配曲、妻剪纸夫配词的新事例。张怀英说，两年来通过展览、幻灯等四十多种活动，从各个方面歌颂和宣传了“三大万岁”，向群众广泛进行了社会主义、共产主义的教育，并且结合各个时期的中心工作，推动了生产的大跃进。
    伟大领袖毛主席在“送瘟神”这首光辉的诗篇中所提到的江西省余江县消灭血吸虫病的成就，是全国闻名的。这个县的代表杨龙祥今天以“‘瘟神’送走福星到”为题在大会上发言。他说，中共余江县委在1956年春，随着合作化高潮的到来和农业发展纲要四十条的公布，提出了两年内根除血吸虫病的宏伟规划，动员了数以万计的群众参加了填沟挖塘、消灭钉螺的战斗。经过两年的苦战，使每一个血吸虫病患者都得到了治疗，恢复了健康，大部分都成为生产上的主力。从此，多少年来流行在余江县的血吸虫病得到了根除，送走了“瘟神”，实现了人民梦寐以求的宿愿，成为全国根除血吸虫病的第一面胜利红旗。
    杨龙祥说，截至目前止，钩虫病、丝虫病、疟疾、性病在全县范围内已经基本消灭，有力地保护了人民群众的健康，促进了生产的发展。
    上海市中、小学课程革新委员会代表刘佛年，代表这个委员会把他们新编出的一百一十六册、八百九十五万字的全套中、小学教科书向大会献礼。刘佛年说，中共上海市委对课程改革工作很重视，以华东师范大学作为基地，动员了大、中、小学各方面的力量，按照中小学课程成立了十三个课程革新委员会，采取专门组织与发动群众相结合的群众运动，来进行课程改革。华东师范大学几百名师生和中小学课程革新委员会的成员，曾先后到大、中、小学和工厂、城乡人民公社、科学研究机关等三百多个单位，作了调查研究，还访问了先进工作者、专家、学生家长以至幼儿园的小朋友，召开座谈会、调查会一千多次。通过这样一个广泛深入的群众运动，他们获得了大量的材料和意见，编出了一整套教材。
