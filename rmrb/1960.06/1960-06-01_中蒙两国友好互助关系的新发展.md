    New Development of Friendly and Mutual Assistance Relations Between China and Mongolia
    Premier Zhou Enlai, at the invitation of Comrade Tsedenbal, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Mongolian People's Republic, recently paid a friendly visit to our fraternal neighbor, Mongolia. Premier Zhou Enlai, carrying the profound friendship of the Chinese people for the Mongolian people, visited and toured Ulaanbaatar, the capital of the Mongolian People's Republic, and other cities and villages in Mongolia. Everywhere he was given a grand and warm welcome by the Mongolian government, party, and people, and everywhere he saw the fraternal friendship of the Mongolian people for the Chinese people. During the visit, Premier Zhou Enlai and Chairman Tsedenbal held sincere and friendly talks, exchanging views on specific issues concerning further consolidation and development of the fraternal friendship and comprehensive cooperation between the two countries, as well as on major international issues, and reached complete agreement. At the same time, Comrades Zhou Enlai and Tsedenbal also held cordial and friendly talks on behalf of the parties of the two countries. During the visit, Premier Zhou Enlai and Chairman Tsedenbal also signed the Sino-Mongolian Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance, the Agreement between the Governments of China and Mongolia on Economic and Technical Assistance from the Chinese Government to the Mongolian Government, and the Sino-Mongolian Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement on behalf of the two governments. The talks between the party and government leaderships of China and Mongolia and the signing of the new treaty and agreements have further strengthened the unbreakable friendship and unity between the two countries and two parties, and made new and significant contributions to peace in Asia and the world.
    There is a deep friendship between the peoples of China and Mongolia. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, this friendship has developed greatly on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. Over the past decade, our two countries' mutual assistance and cooperation in political, economic, and cultural fields have been continuously strengthened. The Sino-Mongolian Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement signed in 1952, and the agreements signed in 1956 and 1958 on the Chinese government's provision of gratuitous assistance and long-term loans to the Mongolian government, are of great significance to the common upsurge of the socialist construction of our two countries. This time, the two governments have signed the Sino-Mongolian Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance. The treaty stipulates that both contracting parties will make every effort to safeguard peace in Asia and the world and the security of all peoples; will consult on all major international issues concerning the common interests of China and Mongolia; will provide each other with all possible economic and technical assistance in the peaceful construction of the two countries; and reaffirms the continued consolidation and development of economic, cultural, and scientific and technological cooperation between the two countries in accordance with the Sino-Mongolian Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement signed in 1952. Undoubtedly, the signing of new treaties and agreements between China and Mongolia, and the development and consolidation of friendly and mutual assistance relations between the two countries, are fully in line with the vital interests of the peoples of China and Mongolia, and are also in line with the interests of the entire socialist camp and world peace.
    The peoples of China and Mongolia, together with the peoples of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, have always made unremitting efforts to ease the international situation. However, U.S. imperialism, under the guise of "peace," is stepping up arms expansion and war preparations, pursuing a policy of aggression, establishing missile bases, strengthening military blocs, and carrying out aggression and provocations against socialist countries. After the crimes of the United States in sending spy planes to invade Soviet airspace and sabotage the Four-Power Summit Conference were exposed, the people of the world further saw clearly the gangster face and aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism. In the joint statement of the two governments, both sides expressed their full support for all the peace initiatives of the Soviet government and its unremitting efforts in easing international tension and ensuring the security of all peoples; resolutely opposed U.S. imperialism's policy of stepping up arms expansion and war preparations and aggravating international tension; strongly condemned U.S. imperialism's provocative act of invading Soviet airspace and sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference, and resolutely supported the Soviet Union's just stand in exposing U.S. imperialism's aggression and safeguarding world peace in Paris. Both sides also believe that the people of all countries must heighten their vigilance, strengthen their unity, and continuously expose the conspiracies and tricks of the imperialist warmongers.
    The frantic suppression of national democratic movements in various countries by the imperialist aggressive bloc headed by the United States can only make the people of all countries awaken more quickly and arouse more resolute and widespread resistance from the people of all countries. In recent years, national democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have surged forward, especially the recent storms of the people of South Korea, Japan, and Turkey against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, which fully proves this point. The peoples of socialist countries have always regarded the national democratic movements of various countries as their allies in the struggle against imperialism. In the joint statement of the two governments, both sides expressed their firm support for the just struggle of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against colonialism and imperialism, for freedom, and for political and economic independence; firmly believed that the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference held in Conakry not long ago will further consolidate the unity of the Asian and African peoples and promote the realization of the great Bandung Principles; and strongly condemned U.S. imperialism's crime of reviving Japanese militarism and concluding a military alliance treaty with Japanese reactionaries, which directly threatens Asian security and world peace, and warmly supported the Japanese people's just struggle for national independence, peace, and democracy. All of these fully express the peace aspirations of the peoples of China and Mongolia and their determination to oppose imperialist aggression.
    In the joint statement, both sides also expressed their support for the reasonable aspirations of the Korean, Vietnamese, and German peoples for the reunification of their motherlands on a peaceful and democratic basis. The Mongolian government expressed its support for the just struggle of our people for the complete withdrawal of U.S. armed forces from our territory of Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait; Chairman Tsedenbal also gave high praise to Premier Zhou Enlai's recent visits to Burma, India, Nepal, Cambodia, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Chinese people express their heartfelt thanks to the Mongolian people for their fraternal support to our people!
    Premier Zhou Enlai visited the Mongolian People's Republic in 1954. In the past six years, the socialist construction of China and Mongolia has been advancing by leaps and bounds, and the face of the country has changed rapidly. As Chairman Tsedenbal said: "Every achievement we have made in economic construction has dealt a heavy blow to the aggressive forces of imperialism and the warmongers." At the same time, the parties and peoples of our two countries have consistently striven to strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, to safeguard the purity of Marxism-Leninism, and to wage a resolute struggle against the most dangerous enemy in the current international communist movement—modern revisionists. In the joint statement, both sides once again firmly stated that they will continue to do their utmost to further develop and expand the fraternal friendship and comprehensive cooperation between the two countries, consolidate the rock-solid unity of the peoples of all countries in the socialist camp, and safeguard world peace and the security of all peoples.
    As Premier Zhou Enlai concludes his visit to the fraternal neighbor of Mongolia and the new Sino-Mongolian treaties and agreements are signed, we sincerely wish the peoples of China and Mongolia to unite even more closely and achieve new and greater successes in the noble cause of building socialism and defending world peace!

    中蒙两国友好互助关系的新发展
    周恩来总理应蒙古人民共和国部长会议主席泽登巴尔的邀请，最近到我们的兄弟邻邦蒙古进行了友好访问。周恩来总理带着中国人民对蒙古人民的深厚友情，访问和参观了蒙古人民共和国首都乌兰巴托和蒙古其他的城市和乡村，到处受到蒙古政府、党和人民的隆重热烈的欢迎，到处看到蒙古人民对中国人民的兄弟友情。在访问期间，周恩来总理和泽登巴尔主席举行了真诚友好的会谈，双方就进一步巩固和发展两国间兄弟友谊和全面合作的具体问题以及国际间的重大问题交换了意见，并且取得了完全一致的看法。与此同时，周恩来同志和泽登巴尔同志还代表两国的党进行了亲切友好的会谈。在访问期间，周恩来总理和泽登巴尔主席又代表中蒙两国政府签订了中蒙友好互助条约、中蒙两国政府关于中国政府给予蒙古政府经济技术援助的协定和中蒙科学技术合作协定。中蒙两国党政领导人的会谈和新的条约和协定的签订，进一步加强了中蒙两国和两党之间的牢不可破的友谊和团结，并为亚洲和世界和平作出了新的重大贡献。
    中蒙两国人民之间有着深厚的友谊。中华人民共和国成立后，这种友谊在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的基础上有了巨大的发展。十年来，我们两国在政治、经济和文化各方面的互助合作关系都在不断地加强。1952年签订的中蒙经济和文化合作协定，以及1956年和1958年签订的关于中国政府给予蒙古政府无偿援助和长期贷款的协定，对于我们两国的社会主义建设事业的共同高涨具有重大意义。这次两国政府又签订了中蒙友好互助条约。条约规定：缔约双方将为维护亚洲和世界的和平和各国人民的安全而尽一切努力；将对有关中蒙两国共同利益的一切重大国际问题进行磋商；在两国的和平建设事业中，彼此将给予一切可能的经济和技术的援助；并且重申根据1952年签订的中蒙经济文化合作协定，继续巩固和发展两国间的经济、文化和科学技术的合作。根据新签订的经济技术援助协定，在1961年到1965年这一期间，中国政府将给予蒙古政府二亿卢布的长期贷款，并且帮助蒙古建设一些工业企业，水利工程和公用事业。无疑地，中蒙两国间新的条约和协定的签订，两国间友好互助关系的发展和巩固，是完全符合中蒙两国人民的切身利益的，同时也是符合整个社会主义阵营和世界和平的利益的。
    中蒙两国人民同以苏联为首的社会主义各国人民一起，始终不渝地为国际局势的和缓而努力。而美帝国主义则借着“和平”的幌子，加紧扩军备战，推行侵略政策，建立导弹基地，加强军事集团，并对社会主义国家进行侵略和挑衅。最近美国派遣间谍飞机侵犯苏联领空和破坏四国首脑会议的罪行被揭露后，全世界人民进一步看清了美帝国主义的强盗嘴脸和侵略本质。在两国政府联合声明中，双方表示完全支持苏联政府的一切和平倡议和在和缓国际紧张局势和保障各国人民安全方面所作的不懈努力；坚决反对美帝国主义加紧扩军备战和加剧国际紧张局势的政策；严正谴责美帝国主义侵犯苏联领空和破坏四国首脑会议的挑衅行为，坚决支持苏联在巴黎揭露美帝国主义的侵略行动、维护世界和平的正义立场。双方并且认为，各国人民必须提高警惕，加强团结，不断揭露帝国主义战争贩子的阴谋诡计。
    以美国为首的帝国主义侵略集团对各国民族民主运动的疯狂镇压，只能使各国人民更快地觉醒和激起各国人民更加坚决、更加广泛的反抗。近年来，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族民主运动风起云涌，特别是最近南朝鲜、日本和土耳其人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的风暴相继兴起，完全证明了这一点。社会主义各国人民一向认为，各国的民族民主运动是他们在反对帝国主义斗争中的同盟军。在两国政府联合声明中，双方表示坚决支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民反对殖民主义和帝国主义、争取自由、争取政治与经济独立的正义斗争；坚信不久前在科纳克里召开的第二届亚非人民团结大会，将进一步巩固亚非人民的团结和促进伟大万隆原则的实现；并且严正谴责美帝国主义复活日本军国主义和同日本反动派缔结军事同盟条约直接威胁亚洲安全和世界和平的罪行，热烈支持日本人民争取民族独立、和平民主的正义斗争。所有这些，都充分表达了中蒙两国人民的和平愿望和反对帝国主义侵略的决心。
    在联合声明中，双方还表示支持朝鲜、越南和德国人民在和平民主的基础上统一祖国的合理愿望。蒙古政府表示支持我国人民关于美国武装部队全部撤出我国领土台湾和台湾海峡的正义斗争；泽登巴尔主席并对周恩来总理最近对缅甸、印度、尼泊尔、柬埔寨和越南民主共和国的访问予以崇高的评价。中国人民对于蒙古人民给予我国人民的兄弟般的支持表示衷心的感谢！
    周恩来总理曾经在1954年访问过蒙古人民共和国。六年来，中蒙两国的社会主义建设一日千里，国家面貌迅速变化。正如泽登巴尔主席所说的：“我们在经济建设方面取得的每一个成就，都给予了帝国主义侵略势力和好战分子以沉重的打击。”同时，我们两国的党和两国人民，一贯为加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，为维护马克思列宁主义的纯洁性和反对当前国际共产主义运动中的最危险的敌人——现代修正主义者进行坚决的斗争。在联合声明中，双方再一次坚决表示，今后将继续竭尽全力来进一步发展和扩大两国间的兄弟友谊和全面合作，巩固社会主义阵营各国人民坚如磐石的团结一致，维护世界和平和各国人民的安全。
    当周恩来总理结束了对兄弟邻邦蒙古的访问和中蒙新的条约和协定签订之际，我们衷心地祝愿中蒙两国人民更加紧密地团结起来，在建设社会主义和保卫世界和平的崇高事业中取得新的更大的成就！
