Xinhua News Agency, London, June 11th: British newspapers today all featured news of the anti-American demonstrations in Tokyo on their front pages. The newspapers prominently displayed photographs of Eisenhower's representative, Hagerty, and U.S. Ambassador to Tokyo, MacArthur II, being surrounded by angry Japanese people and of crowds throwing stones at their cars.

The "Daily Telegraph" headline read, "Helicopter Saves Mr. Hagerty."

Reynold McColl, the "Daily Express" correspondent in Washington, reported from Washington today that "the predicament of poor Eisenhower is simply unimaginable."

McColl said, "A year ago, even three months ago, this planned visit (by Eisenhower) seemed like what Americans call a 'cinch'. But now, the nearly seventy-year-old president, who has a heart condition and has been ill while working, faces not a cool, pleasant trip, but a potentially serious ordeal."

McColl pointed out that Eisenhower, after "making an astonishingly big mistake" and "losing face in the U-2 plane incident," "particularly needs to enhance his prestige." McColl said that Eisenhower needs to do this not only because the United States wants to restore the prestige it has lost abroad, but also to enable the Republican Party to cope with the upcoming presidential election. However, McColl believes that Eisenhower's visit to Tokyo will become "the center of massive demonstrations."

The "Daily Telegraph," in its commentary, emphasized the intensity of anti-American sentiment in Japan, believing that Eisenhower will encounter "hostile demonstrations" like those encountered by Nixon in Caracas, Venezuela, in 1958.

The "Daily Telegraph" believes that Eisenhower is in a dilemma, stating that "if the visit is cancelled, then, as the Japanese government has warned, Kishi Nobusuke will have to resign."

The editorial in today's "New Statesman" weekly said that Kishi Nobusuke represents "the same social stratum" as Syngman Rhee of South Korea and Adnan Menderes of Turkey. The editorial stated, "Therefore, the Americans are bound to be as unpopular as he (Kishi Nobusuke) is."

The "Guardian" said in its June 10th editorial, "This visitor (Eisenhower) will not have a pleasant time traveling in a bulletproof car between many security lines as thick as walls."

### 英国报纸大登特登东京反美示威消息  指出艾森豪威尔访日时将面临空前困境

    英国报纸大登特登东京反美示威消息
    指出艾森豪威尔访日时将面临空前困境
    据新华社伦敦11日电　英国报纸今天都在头版地位刊登了东京举行的反美示威的消息。报纸用显著地位刊载了艾森豪威尔的代表哈格蒂和美国驻东京大使麦克阿瑟第二的汽车被愤怒的日本人民包围和群众向汽车扔石头的照片。
    “每日电讯报”的标题说，“直升飞机救了哈格蒂先生”。
    “每日快报”驻华盛顿记者雷纳·麦科尔今天从华盛顿报道说，“倒霉的艾森豪威尔所处的困境简直是无法想像的。”
    麦科尔说，“一年以前，甚至三个月以前，（艾森豪威尔）计划的这次访问似乎还是美国人所谓的“轻松的事情”。但是现在这位身患心脏病，并在工作时发过一次病的年将七十的总统所面临的不是凉爽的、愉快的旅行，而是很可能发展成为头等严重的考验。”
    麦科尔指出，艾森豪威尔在“犯了惊人的大错误”，“在U—2飞机事件上丢了脸”以后，“特别需要提高威信”。麦科尔说，艾森豪威尔需要这么做，不仅是因为美国想恢复在国外已经丧失的威信，而且也为了使共和党能够应付即将来到的总统选举。但是，麦科尔认为，艾森豪威尔访问东京将成为“大规模的示威所反对的中心”。
    “每日电讯报”在评论中着重指出了日本的反美情绪的激烈程度，它认为，艾森豪威尔这次将碰到像尼克松1958年在委内瑞拉的加拉加斯所碰到的那样的“敌视的示威”。
    “每日电讯报”认为艾森豪威尔处于进退两难的窘境，报纸说，“如果取消这次访问，那么就像日本政府警告那样，岸信介将不得不辞职”。
    今天出版的“新政治家”周刊的社论说，岸信介代表着同南朝鲜李承晚和土耳其曼德列斯“同样的社会阶层”，社论说，“因此，美国人必然同他（岸信介）一样地不得人心”。
    “卫报”在10日的社论中说，“这位访问者（艾森豪威尔）在许多如同墙壁一样厚的警戒线之间坐着防弹汽车旅行是不会怎么愉快的。”
