    Work in the Most Difficult Places and Completely Integrate with the Masses
    Shen Zhaoyun Transforms a Backward Team and Opens Up a New Situation
    Qinghai Provincial Party Committee Calls on Cadres to Learn from This Noble Spirit to Quickly Change the Face of Backward Teams

    (Our report) Qinghai—Shen Zhaoyun, the Party Branch Secretary of Xiguan Production Team of Chengguan Commune in Datong, Qinghai, who works wholeheartedly and diligently for the Party, has developed the communist style of "taking on difficulties," obeyed the commune Party committee's transfer order, and "settled down" from the advanced production team to the backward Dongguan Second Production Team. In his new work position, he paid attention to giving play to the fortress role of the Party branch, set an example in educating cadres and Party members to participate in labor, cared about the thoughts, production, and life of the masses, and extensively mobilized and relied on the masses, making the backward Dongguan Second Production Team jump to become an advanced production team in a short period of time. Recently, the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions to all prefectures, cities, and counties, determining to launch a "Learn from Shen Zhaoyun, Catch up with Shen Zhaoyun" campaign among all Party members and cadres, calling on Party members and cadres to learn from Shen Zhaoyun's noble style, go to backward teams, go to poor teams, go to the most difficult places to work, and help backward teams and poor teams quickly catch up with advanced teams and rich teams.

    The Xiguan Production Team where Shen Zhaoyun was originally located had extensively, deeply, and thoroughly mobilized the masses, had a good work foundation, and had been one of the advanced production teams in Chengguan Commune for several years. In February of this year, in order to strengthen the leadership of backward production teams, the commune Party committee decided to transfer Shen Zhaoyun to Dongguan Second Production Team, which had weaker cadre strength and a poorer work foundation, to serve as the Party branch secretary.

    In Dongguan Second Team, Shen Zhaoyun first concentrated his efforts on improving the Party branch's organization, educating and improving the political consciousness of Party members, and strengthening the core leadership role of the Party branch. When he learned that the Party branch of this production team did not have regular organizational life, he immediately convened a branch meeting to mobilize all Party members to examine their work and study the establishment and improvement of the organizational life system, stipulating that organizational life be conducted once a week, and that major matters of the production team be studied and decided by the branch committee or the general meeting of Party members. For Communist Party members with shortcomings or mistakes, he patiently persuaded and educated them, seriously pointed out the shortcomings, and then let them work freely, correcting shortcomings and errors in their work. For example, Qi Hongji, the cashier of the production team and a Communist Party member, often made excuses not to participate in labor. Shen Zhaoyun pointed out to him that being fond of ease and aversion to work was a bourgeois idea, and encouraged him to cherish the glorious title of Communist Party member and share weal and woe with the commune members. Qi Hongji was deeply moved and went to work with the commune members every day at dawn. After a series of work, all the Party members of Dongguan Second Team were united and worked together harmoniously, greatly strengthening the core leadership role of the branch.

    From the first day he arrived in Dongguan Second Team, Shen Zhaoyun used all the time he could to work with the commune members. As soon as he put down his luggage, he went to the fields to carry ash with the commune members, talking with them while working. In his contact with the commune members, he found that the production team did not have labor quotas, which affected labor efficiency. Therefore, he used his rest time to hold field symposiums to solicit the opinions of commune members on the formulation of labor quotas. Later, he convened a production team management committee to study and formulate a labor quota management system, solving a major problem in business management. Adhering to participating in labor enabled Shen Zhaoyun to accurately grasp and quickly solve key problems in production. For example, in the movement of reclaiming wasteland and sowing at the same time, he led the expedition wasteland reclamation team to set up camp on the wasteland for wasteland reclamation and sowing. In the wasteland reclamation, he studied the soil conditions of the wasteland and found that the soil here was relatively barren and that fertilizer problems had to be solved to ensure increased production. Therefore, he immediately organized labor to smoke and make ash fertilizer, and promptly imparted ash-burning technology, so that the wasteland was well reclaimed and the land was well planted. Under Shen Zhaoyun's leadership, cadres' participation in labor has become a common practice, and commune members have also been greatly encouraged. Commune member Xing Wangui said: "Secretary Shen is so energetic and wholeheartedly serving everyone, we must learn from him very well."

    Caring about the lives of the masses, and grasping life while grasping production, is also Shen Zhaoyun's consistent work style and method. He often visited the homes of commune members to understand their difficulties and needs, and helped them solve them. Once, during a visit, he found that a commune member was sick and had no cash to get medicine, so he immediately ran to the Chinese medicine clinic and signed a contract with the clinic: commune members could see a doctor with a letter of introduction, and the production team would pay the medical expenses uniformly. Shen Zhaoyun was even more concerned about collective welfare undertakings such as public canteens and nurseries. Under Shen Zhaoyun's influence, all the cadres of the production team also cared more about the lives of the masses. Because life was well arranged and difficulties in production could be solved in a timely manner, the commune members' labor enthusiasm increased day by day, and labor efficiency increased by several or several times. For example, in smoking ash fertilizer, generally a laborer can burn three ash piles a day, while this production team averaged five to seven piles.

    Thanks to Shen Zhaoyun's three months of in-depth work, Dongguan Second Team has formed a new situation in which everyone is united, cadres and Party members take the lead in everything, and the broad masses of commune members respond to every call. Wasteland reclamation, spring sowing, and field management have all jumped to the forefront of the entire commune.

    Now, the "Learn from Shen Zhaoyun, Catch up with Shen Zhaoyun" campaign has been launched in various parts of Qinghai. During the campaign, a group of excellent cadres in the "Shen Zhaoyun style" have emerged. For example, Ren Shiduo, the Party Branch Secretary of Xiakou Production Team of Anmenxia Commune in Huzhu Tu Autonomous County, was inspired by the spirit of Shen Zhaoyun and voluntarily applied to work in a backward team. The commune Party committee warmly supported his action and transferred him to the backward Gubian Production Team to serve as the branch secretary. Due to Ren Shiduo's in-depth work, the backwardness of Gubian Production Team has been greatly changed in a short period of time. (Wang Zhenye)

### 到最困难的地方工作　同群众完全打成一片  沈兆云改造后进队打开新局面  青海省委号召干部学习这一崇高精神迅速改变后进队面貌

    到最困难的地方工作　同群众完全打成一片
    沈兆云改造后进队打开新局面
    青海省委号召干部学习这一崇高精神迅速改变后进队面貌
    本报讯　忠心耿耿、勤勤恳恳为党工作的青海大通城关公社西关生产队党支部书记沈兆云，发扬了“见困难就上”的共产主义风格，服从公社党委调动，从先进生产队到后进的东关第二生产队“落户”。他在新的工作岗位上注意发挥党支部的堡垒作用，以身作则教育干部和党员参加劳动，关心群众的思想、生产和生活，并广泛发动和依靠群众，使后进的东关第二生产队在短期内一跃而为先进生产队。最近，中共青海省委给各州、市、县发出指示，确定在全体党员和干部中开展“学沈兆云、赶沈兆云”的运动，号召党员和干部学习沈兆云的崇高风格，到后进队去、到穷队去、到最困难的地方去工作，帮助后进队和穷队迅速赶上先进队和富队。
    沈兆云原来所在的西关生产队，群众发动得广、深、透，工作基础好，几年来一直是城关公社的先进生产队之一。今年2月，公社党委为了加强后进生产队的领导力量，决定把沈兆云调到干部力量较弱、工作基础较差的东关第二生产队任党支部书记。
    在东关二队，沈兆云首先集中力量健全党支部的组织，教育和提高党员的政治觉悟，加强党支部的核心领导作用。当他了解到这个生产队的党支部组织生活不够经常的情况以后，立即召开支部大会发动全体党员检查工作，研究建立和健全组织生活制度，规定每周过一次组织生活，生产队的重大事情由支委会或党员大会研究决定。对于有缺点或错误的共产党员，他耐心地进行说服教育，严肃地指出缺点，然后放手让他们工作，在工作中纠正缺点、改正错误。如生产队的出纳、共产党员祁洪吉，经常借故不参加劳动，沈兆云就向他指出好逸恶劳是资产阶级思想，并勉励他珍惜共产党员的光荣称号，和社员同甘共苦。祁洪吉深深受了感动，每天天一亮就和社员一起出工。经过一系列工作，东关二队的全体党员团结一致、和衷共济，使支部的核心领导作用大大加强。
    沈兆云从到东关二队的第一天起，就利用一切可能利用的时间，和社员一起劳动。他刚放下行李，就下地和社员一起背灰，边劳动边和社员交谈。在和社员接触中，他发现这个生产队没有劳动定额，对劳动效率有影响。于是，他就利用休息时间召开地头座谈会，征求社员对制定劳动定额的意见。以后，又召开生产队管理委员会，研究制定了劳动定额管理制度，解决了经营管理中的一个重大问题。坚持参加劳动，使沈兆云能够准确地抓住和迅速解决生产中的关键问题。比如在边开荒、边播种的运动中，他率领远征开荒队到荒地上安营扎寨，进行开荒和播种。在开荒中，他研究了荒地的土壤情况，发现这里的土壤比较贫瘠，必须解决肥料问题才能保证增产。于是，就立即组织劳动力熏造灰肥，并及时传授了烧灰技术，做到了开好荒、种好地。在沈兆云的带动下，干部参加劳动已经形成风气，社员也受到巨大鼓舞。社员邢万贵说：“沈书记劲头这么大，全心全意为大家办事，我们一定要很好地向他学习。”
    关心群众生活，在抓生产的同时抓生活，也是沈兆云一贯的工作作风和工作方法。他经常到社员家里串门子，了解社员的困难和要求，并且帮助解决。有一次，他在串门时发现一个社员病了，没现钱抓药，便随即跑到中医门诊所，和门诊所订立了一个合同：社员凭介绍信看病，由生产队统一支付医药费。公共食堂和托儿所等集体福利事业，沈兆云更为关心。在沈兆云的影响下，生产队的所有干部也都更加关心群众生活了。由于生活安排得好，生产中困难又能及时得到解决，社员的劳动情绪日益高涨，劳动效率成倍或几倍地提高。比如熏灰肥，一般一个劳动力一天能烧三个灰，而这个生产队平均达到五至七个。
    由于沈兆云三个月的深入工作，东关二队已经形成上下左右拧成一股绳的新局面，干部、党员凡事带头，广大社员一呼百应，开荒、春播和田间管理工作，都跃居全公社的前列。
    现在，“学沈兆云、赶沈兆云”的运动，已经在青海各地开展起来，在运动中，涌现了一批“沈兆云式”的优秀干部。如互助土族自治县闇门峡公社峡口生产队的党支部书记任世铎，在沈兆云的精神鼓舞下，自动申请到后进队工作。公社党委热烈支持他的行动，把他调到后进的古边生产队担任支部书记。由于任世铎深入进行工作，古边生产队的落后面貌，在短期内即有很大改变。（王振业）
