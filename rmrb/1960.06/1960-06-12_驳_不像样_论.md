    Refuting the "Unseemly" Argument
    Zhu Jindai, Maintenance Worker, State-Run No. 17 Cotton Mill
    In our factory, an old worker wanted to improve a part on the loom. After discussing it with a cadre in the workshop, the cadre said: Your modification is good, but it doesn't quite look like a loom anymore. The old worker replied well: If my modification makes the loom look unseemly, wouldn't the multi-head machine tool improved by the workers in the machinery factory look even more unseemly? The cadre smiled and had nothing to say.
    In the technical revolution, there are many similar criticisms of "unseemliness." Improving a machine so it doesn't look like the original is called "unseemly"; improvising with local methods and using native techniques, which don't resemble large, foreign machines, is also called "unseemly." In fact, whether a machine "looks good" or "unseemly" is secondary. The main thing is to see whether its actual efficiency is high and whether it plays a significant role in production. During the nationwide steelmaking campaign in 1958, we used "unseemly" equipment, "unseemly" materials, and "unseemly" operating methods to work hard. Compared with modern steel plants, it was indeed "unseemly," but the result was that we made steel and trained people. The "small-scale native groups" made great efforts and contributions to the high-speed development of China's steel industry. Now, these "unseemly" "small-scale native groups" have become more and more "seemly," and they continue to create many new records and new achievements. Facts are the standard for testing truth and the witness of right and wrong. People who used to say "unseemly" now have to admit defeat.
    During the arduous War of Resistance Against Japan, Comrade Wu Yunduo, under extremely difficult conditions, used native methods to establish a very "unseemly" arsenal. However, relying on this arsenal, he supplied the front lines with many "seemly" weapons, driving the Japanese devils to defeat. After visiting this "unseemly" arsenal, foreigners couldn't help but admire it, saying: This is the best arsenal in the world. What's wrong with being "unseemly" like this?
    In our workshop, after the speed of the machines was increased, many machine materials were in short supply. The workers used their brains and found many "unseemly" substitutes, weaving textiles that fully met the requirements and overfulfilling the production plan. What's wrong with being "unseemly" like this?
    From this, it can be seen that the so-called "unseemly" argument actually does not advocate the combination of native and foreign methods, nor does it advocate both "grasping the watermelon" and "picking up sesame seeds." They prefer foreign things and dislike native ones, prefer large things and dislike small ones. They cannot see the wisdom of the working masses, nor can they see the power of the Party's General Line and the whole set of "walking on two legs" policy. If it is said that only the old, the large, and the foreign are "seemly," and the new, the small, and the native are all "unseemly" and cannot be used, then how can we accelerate the change of our country's "poor and blank" face, and how can we develop our country's social productive forces at high speed?
    No new thing can be very "seemly" at the beginning, but must be continuously improved in practice. There is no such thing as a new thing being perfect from the beginning. The standard for measuring whether a new thing is "seemly" should be whether it has unleashed its potential and whether it has improved labor productivity. Our country is still "poor and blank." We cannot wait until every factory has been replaced with "seemly" new machines before making a great leap forward. We must mainly rely on our own hands to transform the old machines so that they can exert greater power and accelerate socialist construction.

    驳“不像样”论
    国棉十七厂保全工　朱金大
    我们厂里一位老工人，想改进布机上的一个部件。他向车间的一位干部谈了之后，这位干部说：你这样改，好是好，可就是有点不大像布机的样子了。这位老工人回答得好：我这样一改，布机不像样了，那末，机械厂工人改进的多头机床，不是更不像样了吗？这位干部笑笑没有话说了。
    在技术革命中，类似这样的“不像样”的批评是不少的。改进了机器，不像原来的样子了，这叫“不像样”；因陋就简，土法上马，不像大的洋机器，这也叫“不像样”。其实，机器“像样”不“像样”，这是次要的，主要是看它的实际效能高不高，在生产中发挥的作用大不大。在1958年全民炼钢运动中，我们用了不“像样”的设备、不“像样”的材料、用不“像样”的操作方法，大干起来，要和现代化的钢铁厂比起来，的确不“像样”，但结果是炼钢又炼人，“小土群”为高速度发展我国钢铁工业出了大力，立了大功。现在，这些“不像样”的“小土群”已经愈发展愈“像样”了，而且，不断地创造出了许多新记录和新成绩。事实是检验真理的标准，是是非的见证人，以前说“不像样”的人，现在不能不服输了。
    在艰苦的抗日战争时期，吴运铎同志在非常艰苦的条件下，用土而又土办法，建立了很“不像样”的兵工厂。但是靠了这个兵工厂，却供应了前线许多“像样”的武器，把日本鬼子打得落花流水。外国人在参观这个“不像样”的兵工厂后，也不得不佩服地说：这是世界上最好的兵工厂。像这样的“不像样”有什么不好呢？
    我们车间里，在车速加快后，许多机物料供不应求，工人们自己开动脑筋，找寻了许多“不像样”的代用品，织成了完全符合要求的纺织品，超额完成了生产计划。像这样的“不像样”又有什么不好呢？
    由此可见，所谓“不像样”的论调实际上是不主张用土洋结合的办法、不主张既要抱“西瓜”、又要扫“芝麻”。他们喜洋厌土、喜大厌小，看不见工人群众的智慧，看不见党的总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针的威力。如果说，老的、大的、洋的才“像样”，新的、小的、土的都“不像样”，都不能要，那又如何加速改变我们国家“一穷二白”的面貌呢，如何高速度地发展我国社会生产力呢。
    任何一件新的事物，不可能一开始就很“像样”，而必须在实践中不断改进。新事物一开始就完美无缺是没有的，衡量新事物“像样”不“像样”的标准，应该是看它是否发挥了潜在力量，是否提高了劳动生产率？我们的国家现在还是“一穷二白”，不能等每个工厂都换上了“像样”的新机器后再来跃进，主要地还要依靠我们用自己的双手，把旧机器加以改造，使它发挥出更大的威力，加快社会主义建设。
