    To Comrade Boqu’s Spirit

    Xu Terli

    After the Xinhai Revolution, the Tongmenghui collapsed, the Chinese Revolutionary Party, the European Affairs Research Association
    Boqu distinguished between the Jing and Wei rivers during that time, strictly. He practiced hand-to-hand combat to enforce discipline, Huang Xing opposed.
    Boqu focused on major principles, not worrying about minor details, generously practiced hand-to-hand combat, his spirit shattered mountains and rocks.
    After Chiang Kai-shek opposed the Communists, civil war dragged on for a long time. The Kuomintang and the Communists cooperated again, appearing united but with different goals.
    Between the enemy and us, Boqu distinguished with utmost care.
    Boqu was extremely peaceful, even political enemies feared him. He distinguished right from wrong in Yan'an and Chongqing, defeating the Participating Political Council.
    A model for Party members, sufficient to set an example for future generations.

    This is a poem I wrote fifteen years ago to celebrate Comrade Boqu’s sixtieth birthday. Comrade Boqu has passed away. I re-record this poem to express my grief.

    伯渠同志灵右
    徐特立
    辛亥革命后　同盟会崩溃　中华革命党　欧事研究会
    伯渠于其间　严格辨泾渭　纪律打手模　黄兴出反对
    伯渠重大节　小节无所谓　慷慨打手模　峥嵘山岳碎。
    蒋氏反共后　内战亘长期　国共重合作　貌合又神离
    敌友我之间　伯渠辨毫厘。
    伯渠极和平　政敌见之畏　延渝真是非　战胜参政会
    党员之模范　足以型后辈。
    这是我十五年前贺伯渠同志六十寿写的诗，伯渠同志逝世了，重录此诗以志哀感。
