Xinhua News Agency, Lima, May 31st: The Peruvian people's struggle against U.S. imperialist economic plunder and for democracy is continuing to develop. Following a rally of 50,000 people in the capital on May 25 to protest the persecution of students, 3,000 residents of the capital held a demonstration in front of the Ministry of Interior. On May 27, ten thousand residents of Cusco, the capital of Cusco Province in southeastern Peru, also held a rally and demonstration, chanting slogans such as "Down with U.S. Imperialism!" and "Long Live the Cuban Revolution!" Representatives of teachers, workers, and students, as well as congressmen Correa and Caro, severely condemned the policies that have created Peru's current tragic economic situation and the trampling on civil liberties.

On the same day, 6,000 residents of Chiclayo, the capital of Lambayeque Province in northern Peru, also held a rally demanding the recovery of the "La Brea-Pariñas" oil fields, which were seized by U.S. imperialism.

At the same time, the strike at the Chimbote metallurgical plant belonging to the U.S.-controlled Peruvian Corporation del Santa is still going on. They demand the immediate implementation of the agreement to increase wages according to the increase in living expenses.

At the beginning of May, the atrocities committed by the U.S. Cerro de Pasco Copper Corporation and Grace Company against Peruvian workers and peasants aroused widespread protests from the Peruvian public. After the government took repressive measures, the wave of opposition to the United States and defense of national and democratic rights is further rising throughout the country.

In a recent statement, the Political Committee of the Peruvian Communist Party stated that the current struggle of the Peruvian people is the second national liberation battle for Peru to get rid of imperialist and feudal shackles. The Peruvian Communist Party demands a thorough change in the country's political and economic policies.

At the demand of the people, the Minister of Education and the Minister of Interior of the Cabinet have resigned one after another.

    打倒美帝国主义　保卫民族民主权利
    秘鲁各地成千上万人集会游行
    在人民要求下内阁教育部长和内政部长相继辞职
    新华社利马5月31日电　秘鲁人民反对美帝国主义经济掠夺和要求民主的斗争正在继续发展中。继5月25日首都五万人举行大会抗议迫害学生之后，首都居民三千人又在内政部门前举行了示威游行。秘鲁东南部库斯科省省会库斯科一万居民在5月27日也举行了集会和游行，他们高呼“打倒美帝国主义”、“古巴革命万岁”等口号。教师、工人、学生的代表及众议员科雷亚和卡罗等在会上严厉谴责造成秘鲁目前悲惨的经济状况的政策和蹂躏公民自由。
    在同一天，秘鲁北部拉姆巴耶凯省省会契克拉约的六千居民也举行了集会，要求收回被美帝国主义强占的“拉布雷亚—帕里纳斯”石油矿藏。
    与此同时，受美资控制的秘鲁德尔桑塔公司所属契姆波特冶金工厂的罢工还在坚持中。他们要求立即履行按生活费用上涨增加工资的协定。
    5月初美国塞罗德帕斯科铜公司和格雷斯公司迫害秘鲁工人和农民的暴行，曾引起秘鲁全国公众的广泛抗议。在政府采取镇压措施以后，反对美国和保卫民族民主权利的浪潮，正在全国各地进一步高涨起来。
    秘鲁共产党政治委员会在最近发表的一项声明中说，秘鲁人民当前的斗争是秘鲁摆脱帝国主义和封建桎梏的第二次民族解放的战役。秘鲁共产党要求彻底改变国家的政治、经济方针。
    在人民要求下，内阁教育部长和内政部长已相继辞职。
