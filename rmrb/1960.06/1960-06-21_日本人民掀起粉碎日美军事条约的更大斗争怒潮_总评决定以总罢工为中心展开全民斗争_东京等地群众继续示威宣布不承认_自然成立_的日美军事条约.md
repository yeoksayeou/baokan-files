Xinhua News Agency, 20th, Tokyo Dispatch: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) held a meeting of representatives from various industrial unions in Tokyo today, deciding to hold a more powerful fourth nationwide general strike on the 22nd to struggle for the crushing of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and the overthrow of the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet.

According to the decision, the number of participants in this general strike will exceed six million, and the strike wave will sweep across more than 110 industrial sectors throughout Japan.

The general strike policy of Sohyo has received full support from various parties, including the "National Council Against Revision of the Security Treaty." Sohyo's plan is to coordinate the general strike of trade unions with student strikes and shop closures, making the 22nd a day of national uprising, with the trade union strike as the center. Kyodo News Agency said, "It is estimated that this action will greatly affect the (Japanese) political situation."

Sohyo decided that the main force of this general strike would be the National Railway Workers' Union, which had dealt heavy blows to the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries in the previous three general strikes, as well as the Japan Private Railway Workers' Union Confederation and the Japan Municipal Transport Workers' Union, and other transportation sector unions. Workers will also hold passenger rallies at major stations in Tokyo and Osaka, calling on passengers to demand the dissolution of the Diet and the resignation of Nobusuke Kishi before the U.S. and Japanese governments exchange the ratification instruments of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and to protest illegal suppression and strongly support the workers' general strike.

In order to successfully hold this general strike, Sohyo decided to establish a "June 22nd Struggle Committee" within its headquarters, with Sohyo Chairman Kaoru Ota as the chairman, to lead the struggle in the Kanto region; the headquarters will send Vice-Chairman Yoshinobu Kadoma to the Kansai region to lead the strike; at the same time, "June 22nd Struggle Regional Committees" will be established throughout the country to lead local strikes.

Sohyo also decided that in order to widely publicize the significance of the June 22nd protest strike, leaflets will be widely distributed before the 22nd; in the afternoon of the 20th, a meeting will be held with representatives from all walks of life, such as scholars, students, businessmen, and general small and medium-sized entrepreneurs, to make arrangements so that this general strike will become a strike of the whole people.

The Japan National Railway Workers' Union, with more than 350,000 members, decided today to participate in the "June 22nd General Strike" with the largest-scale strike and issued instructions to its local union organizations.

The union decided to hold two to three-hour workplace rallies at 770 important stations in Tokyo, Osaka, and other places.

Kyodo News Agency said that the strike by national railway workers will be "the largest strike in the history of the Japanese National Railways."

Xinhua News Agency, 20th, Tokyo Dispatch: The Japanese "National Council Against Revision of the Security Treaty" issued a statement tonight, protesting against the Kishi Nobusuke group's illegal passage of bills related to the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in the House of Councillors.

These bills, which are designed to implement the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, were illegally "passed" this morning by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party alone in the absence of the opposition parties. When they convened the meeting, they announced the opening of the meeting before the opposition party members of the Socialist Party and others entered the conference hall. Without any deliberation, the vote was quickly taken, taking only one minute in total.

The statement of the National Council stated that the Kishi Nobusuke government and the Liberal Democratic Party unilaterally voted on the bills related to the "Security Treaty" with lightning speed. This is a thieving and secretive act of violence. Such an action is a struggle for them who are completely isolated among the people, and also a fascist reactionary dictatorship. Due to this tyrannical act, the people's anger towards the Kishi cabinet will be like adding fuel to the fire.

The statement said, we are determined to launch a larger-scale unified action in order to demand the resignation of the Kishi cabinet, the dissolution of the Diet, and the prevention of the "Security Treaty."

The Japan Socialist Party also issued a statement today, announcing that it does not recognize the bills related to the "Security Treaty" unilaterally voted on by the Liberal Democratic Party in the House of Councillors.

The statement said that the Kishi Nobusuke group's behavior is a series of acts of undermining democracy since the 19th of last month. "At present, neither the Diet nor the law has any prestige, and under the one-party dictatorship of the Kishi cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party, everything has been destroyed, and the crisis of fascism is getting more and more serious." The statement said, "We do not recognize the new Security Treaty which is the source of this bill, and we also do not recognize the passage of this bill."

Xinhua News Agency, 19th, Tokyo Dispatch: Today, after the victorious conclusion of the eighteenth nationwide unified action, demonstrations, rallies, and strikes are continuing throughout Japan, striking at the Nobusuke Kishi traitorous government.

In Tokyo, workers and students continued their demonstrations and publicity activities on the streets today, after surrounding the Diet and the Prime Minister's residence for overnight protests.

Students carried placards at major stations for publicity, with placards reading, "The struggle is not over, continue to fight to reject the Security Treaty." The students appealed to pedestrians to declare the "naturally enacted" new "Security Treaty" invalid.

The students also called on citizens to support the fourth general strike scheduled for the 22nd.

More than 1,000 representatives from joint struggle organizations from all over the country first held a demonstration in front of the Diet this afternoon, and then went to the front of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department to hold a meeting, strongly protesting the police's bloody suppression of demonstrators. The meeting passed a resolution demanding the immediate release of arrested students and workers, demanding the resignation of Police Superintendent General Ogura, and severely punishing the murderers and fascist violent groups.

Another marching column also held a demonstration in front of Nobusuke Kishi's private residence in Nanpeidai.

Students at Meiji University launched an indefinite strike, declaring that they demanded that the Nobusuke Kishi government immediately release all arrested students.

Today, people continued to burn incense in front of the spirit tablet of Michiko Kamba in front of the South Gate of the Diet.

Gunma Prefecture held a prefectural citizen's rally today against the "Security Treaty" and demanding the resignation of the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet. 15,000 people, including workers, students, women, and Socialist Party members, participated in the conference. The conference first prayed for the heroic sacrifice of Michiko Kamba, and then passed resolutions to oppose the Security Treaty, demand the resignation of the Kishi cabinet, and dissolve the Diet. After the meeting, a demonstration was held.

10,000 students in Kyoto held a memorial service today for Michiko Kamba, protesting the fascist suppression of the Nobusuke Kishi government. After the meeting, the students held a demonstration in the rain.

The Kyoto Cultural Forum, composed of 23 cultural groups in Kyoto, issued a statement today demanding the resignation of Nobusuke Kishi and the immediate dissolution of the Diet.

Rallies were held in cities such as Osaka and Sapporo to oppose the new "Security Treaty" and demand the resignation of the Kishi cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet. (Attached picture)

    日本人民掀起粉碎日美军事条约的更大斗争怒潮
    总评决定以总罢工为中心展开全民斗争
    东京等地群众继续示威宣布不承认“自然成立”的日美军事条约
    新华社20日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会今天在东京举行各产业工会代表会议，决定在22日举行更加强大的第四次全国总罢工，为粉碎日美军事同盟条约、打倒岸信介内阁而斗争。
    根据决定，参加这次总罢工的人数将超过六百万，罢工浪潮将席卷日本全国各地的一百一十多个产业部门。
      “总评”的总罢工方针已经得到“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”等各方面的全面支持。“总评”的计划是，以工会的总罢工为中心，同学生的罢课、商店的罢市等行动配合起来，把22日作为国民总奋起行动日。共同社说，“人们估计这种行动将大大影响（日本）的政局”。
      “总评”决定，这次总罢工的主力是曾经在前三次总罢工中给美日反动派以沉重打击的国营铁道工会以及日本私营铁道工会总联合会、日本都市交通工会等交通部门的工会。工人们还要在东京、大阪的各主要车站举行乘客大会，呼吁乘客要求在美、日政府互换新日美“安全条约”的批准书以前解散国会和岸信介下台，并且抗议非法镇压，强有力地支援工人的总罢工。
    为了胜利举行这次总罢工，“总评”决定在总部内设立“六·二二”斗争委员会，由“总评”议长太田熏担任委员长，以便领导关东地区的斗争；由总部派遣副议长门间吉信前往关西地区领导罢工；同时，要在全国各地设立“六·二二斗争地区委员会”，领导各地罢工。
      “总评”并且决定，为了广泛宣传“六·二二”抗议罢工的意义，将在22日以前广泛地散发传单；在20日下午，还将同学者、学生、商人、一般中小企业家等各阶层的代表开会，进行安排，使这次总罢工成为全民的罢工。
    拥有三十五万多会员的日本国营铁道工会今天决定以最大规模的罢工参加“六·二二总罢工”，并且向它的各地工会组织发出了指令。
    这个工会决定在东京、大阪等七百七十个重要的车站举行二至三小时的工作场所大会。
    共同社说，国营铁路工人的罢工将会成为日本“国营铁道有史以来最大规模的一次罢工”。
    新华社20日讯　东京消息：日本“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”今天晚上发表声明，抗议岸信介集团在参议院非法通过同新日美“安全条约”有关的法案。
    这些为了执行日美军事同盟条约的法案是今天早晨在反对党没有出席的情况下由执政的自由民主党非法地单独“通过”的。他们在开会时，还没有等到社会党等在野党议员进入会议厅，就宣布开会。没有进行任何审议，就迅速地进行表决，前后总共只用了一分钟的时间。
    国民会议的声明说，岸信介政府和自由民主党以迅雷不及掩耳的手法单独表决了同“安全条约”有关的法案。这是小偷鼠窃的暴力行为。这样的行动是在国民中完全陷于孤立的他们的一种挣扎，同时也是法西斯的反动独裁政治。由于这种横暴行为，国民对岸内阁的愤怒将如火上添油。
    声明说，为了要求岸内阁下台、解散国会和阻止“安全条约”，我们已经下定决心展开更大规模的统一行动。
    日本社会党今天也发表声明，宣布不承认自由民主党在参议院单独表决的同“安全条约”有关的法案。
    声明说，岸信介集团的行为是从上月19日以来的一系列破坏民主的行为。“目前，国会也好，法律也好，它们的威信都已扫地，在岸内阁、自由民主党的一党独裁的情况下，一切都遭到破坏，法西斯化的危机越来越严重了。”声明说，“我们没有承认成为这个法案的根源的新安全条约，同样也不承认这个法案的通过。”
    新华社19日讯　东京消息：在十八次全国统一行动胜利结束的今天，日本全国各地继续进行着示威集会和罢课，打击着岸信介卖国政府。
    在东京，工人和学生在包围国会和首相官邸通宵进行抗议之后，今天又到街上进行示威和宣传活动。
    学生们在各主要车站举着标语牌进行宣传活动，标语牌上写着“斗争还没有结束，继续为拒绝接受安全条约而进行斗争”。学生们向行人呼吁，大家宣布“自然成立”的新“安全条约”无效。
    学生们还呼吁市民支援预定在22日举行的第四次总罢工。
    来自全国各地的共同斗争组织代表一千多人今天下午先在国会前面举行示威游行，然后前往东京警视厅前面举行大会，强烈抗议警察血腥镇压示威群众。大会通过决议，要求立即释放被捕学生和工人，要求警视总监小仓辞职，严惩凶手和法西斯暴力团体。
    另一支游行队伍还到南平台岸信介私人住宅前面举行了示威游行。
    明治大学的学生展开了无限期罢课的斗争，他们声明要求岸信介政府立即释放所有被捕学生。
    今天到国会南便门前面向桦美智子灵位烧香的人源源不绝。
    群马县今天举行了反对“安全条约”、要求岸信介内阁总辞职的县民大会。参加大会的有工人、学生、妇女和社会党议员等一万五千人。大会首先为英勇牺牲的桦美智子祈祷，然后通过了决定反对安全条约、要求岸内阁总辞职和解散国会等决议。会后举行了示威游行。
    京都的一万名学生今天为桦美智子举行了追悼大会，抗议岸信介政府的法西斯镇压。会后，学生们冒雨举行了示威游行。
    由京都二十三个文化团体组成的京都文化恳谈会，今天发表声明，要求岸信介下台和立即解散国会。
