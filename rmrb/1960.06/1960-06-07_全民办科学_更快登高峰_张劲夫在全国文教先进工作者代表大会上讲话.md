Xinhua News Agency, June 6th: Zhang Jingfu, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, delivered a speech this morning at the National Congress of Advanced Units and Advanced Workers in Socialist Construction in Education, Culture, Health, Sports, and Journalism, titled "The Whole Nation Runs Science, Ascending to the Peak Faster."

Zhang Jingfu summarized the main situation on China's current science front as "The whole nation runs science, continuous great leap forward." He said that a fundamental change in China's scientific undertaking in the past eleven years is that the situation in the past where only a few people engaged in scientific research in a cold and desolate manner is gone forever. The momentum of the whole nation running science is becoming more and more magnificent. Especially due to the vigorous rise of the national-scale technical innovation and technological revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, the mass movement of combining scientific research with production and construction has moved to a new stage, forming a nationwide scientific and technological popularization movement unprecedented in history, and also a nationwide scientific and technological improvement movement unprecedented in history. The movement is still developing. Its great significance and far-reaching influence will become clearer as time goes on. But judging from the initial development of the movement, it has already shown unparalleled power, enabling China's science and technology to develop in new ways: First, science and technology can comprehensively launch mass movements. Not only can general technology launch mass movements, but new technologies can also launch mass movements, and even theoretical science can launch mass movements. Second, research and application are closely combined, and the five-pronged approach of simultaneous research, design, trial use, promotion, and improvement is implemented, breaking the old method of mechanical division of stages, so that many research results are quickly applied and promoted in production as soon as they show good signs, and at the same time, they are supplemented and improved by the wisdom of the masses, making them more perfect. This greatly accelerates the progress of scientific research and enables the results to quickly play a role in production and construction. Third, we learn and apply, while also developing and creating. Through the practice of such a great, vivid, and colorful mass-based technical innovation and technological revolution movement, thousands of people and millions of practical experiments are conducting the most profound and rigorous inspection of all existing scientific and technological knowledge; enriching it, breaking through many outdated old and inapplicable theories and technologies, and developing and creating many new theories, new technologies, and new processes. Fourth, with the development of scientific activities on a national scale, scientific research institutions, such as various specialized or part-time research institutes, research offices, and even scientific research groups, have been widely established. A national scientific research network is being built.

Zhang Jingfu said that the current situation of scientific work is very good, but the tasks are arduous. The high-speed development of socialist construction and the vigorous development of the technological revolution movement, on the one hand, give great impetus to scientific work, and on the other hand, put forward higher requirements for scientific work, that is, to use a faster speed to make China's industrial and agricultural production and construction and national defense construction based on advanced scientific and technological foundations. He said, "If we do not advance quickly, we will fall back." If we do not advance quickly, we will lag behind. We must accelerate the leap forward in order to meet the requirements of the situation. "Higher speed, more leap forward" is our scientists' belief and determination.

Zhang Jingfu said that according to the arrangements and deployments of the State Science and Technology Commission, scientific work in 1960 mainly has the following tasks:

Closely combine with the needs of national construction, carry out research on major scientific and technological issues in the national economy, and accelerate the technological transformation of industry and agriculture. This is the primary task.

Vigorously develop research on cutting-edge science and technology. Cutting-edge science and technology are the most rapidly developing sectors in modern science. China's original foundation was too poor, so we must catch up and master the world's existing advanced achievements as soon as possible, and develop new creations.

Strengthen the research work of basic theory. The Great Leap Forward and the technological revolution movement have already created many miracles in production technology. Many of these phenomena have broken through the old theories and are pregnant with new scientific theories. If we study these problems clearly from a theoretical perspective, it is possible to further improve and develop those inventions and creations, and apply them in a wider range. In China's construction, it is difficult to solve many unique scientific and technological problems by relying on the world's existing theoretical achievements. We must have our own theoretical creations. At the same time, there are many important scientific theoretical fields, although they may not necessarily have a significant impact on production practice at present, but it can already be foreseen that they will open up avenues for mankind to increase productivity hundreds or thousands of times tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. This kind of work must also be grasped and studied as soon as possible.

In his speech, Zhang Jingfu talked about the issue of further carrying out the mass movement of the whole nation running science by holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. He said that the socialist revolution on China's scientific front was won under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. The road of China's scientific work was formed under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. The fact that scientific undertakings can achieve "the whole nation runs science, continuous great leap forward" is a victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out to us very early on the necessity and possibility of high-speed development of scientific undertakings. As early as 1955, Comrade Mao Zedong said: "In the future, there will be all kinds of undertakings that people have never imagined, several times, ten times, or even dozens of times the current yield of crops. The development of industry, transportation, and exchange will be beyond the imagination of our predecessors. The same is true for science, culture, education, health, and other undertakings." Then, at the beginning of 1956, Comrade Mao Zedong issued the great call to strive to quickly catch up with the world's advanced scientific level at the meeting on intellectual problems convened by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. This call was quickly and enthusiastically responded to by the vast number of workers, peasants, and intellectuals, and began the great march to conquer scientific and technological backwardness. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results" adopted by the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, and a whole set of two-legged walking policies for realizing the general line, provided a powerful ideological weapon for the Party to lead scientific undertakings, created a situation in which the whole Party and the whole people run science, and gave China's scientific undertakings the broadest and most profound mass foundation, thus unveiling a new page of high-speed development in the history of China's scientific development.

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out the truth that "the humble are the most intelligent, and the noble are the most foolish," and put forward the call to "liberate thought and break superstition," helping the broad masses and scientific workers break through the shackles of bourgeois scientific traditions, cut off self-abasement, and establish the fearless pioneering spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do. This pioneering spirit is invaluable for the high-speed development of science.

Comrade Mao Zedong's theory on the dialectical unity of theory and practice, and the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," revealed the objective law of scientific development, inspired people to consciously grasp and apply it, thereby leading scientific undertakings to a high degree of prosperity and activity.

Comrade Mao Zedong's philosophical thought is not only a theoretical weapon to guide us in carrying out social class struggle, but also a theoretical weapon to guide us in carrying out the struggle against nature.

From the above-mentioned aspects, it can already strongly illustrate that Mao Zedong Thought has an immeasurable great effect and far-reaching influence on scientific undertakings, and is an inexhaustible ideological treasure house.

Zhang Jingfu said that in order to further consolidate the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in all fields of our scientific work, and further carry out the mass movement of the whole nation running science, we must also grasp the following tasks:

Constantly liberate thought. We must not only constantly break through the framework of the shackles of bourgeois scientific traditions, but also constantly overcome the idea of ​​being complacent and conservative with a little achievement. Under the situation of the whole nation running science and continuous great leap forward, a mass and mighty impact has been made on the traditional methods and systems of bourgeois scientific work, breaking the old methods and old systems that are not suitable for socialism and not suitable for achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and gradually building a set of new working methods and systems that are suitable for the characteristics of China's socialist scientific undertakings and suitable for achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. However, the ideological shackles of bourgeois scientific traditions cannot be completely broken in a short period of time, but must be constantly revolutionized and constantly break through the framework in the development of the movement.

Carry forward the communist style, strengthen communist large-scale collaboration; better combine research institutions with factories and schools, better combine research work, education work, and production work, and better combine researchers with teachers, students, workers, and peasants. We must follow the principle of "improving on the basis of popularization and popularizing under the guidance of improvement" put forward by Comrade Mao Zedong, and engage in the large-scale popularization of science with the masses, and at the same time engage in the large-scale improvement of science, relying on the vast masses to open up the situation and break through the gaps; at the same time, we must grasp the most promising signs, grasp the most important contradictions of things, conduct detailed and in-depth research, consolidate the results, and rise to the theoretical form.

Scientific research should also vigorously promote the combination of indigenous and foreign methods. To vigorously promote mass movements, we must combine indigenous and foreign methods and start with indigenous methods. Without vigorously promoting indigenous methods, we cannot vigorously promote mass movements. In the past, one of the important reasons why some science and technology could not be widely promoted and used among the masses to form a mass movement was because they were restricted by the conditions of "foreign equipment." Without breaking through this framework, the mass movement of scientific research is difficult to carry out widely. The so-called "indigenous" must have new views. There is a type of "indigenous" that is relatively elementary and simple. It should be started first, and then gradually improved and upgraded, from elementary to advanced, from simple and rough to precise. There is also a type of "indigenous" that is native and has great creativity. It looks simple, but the principle is very advanced, "deep and simple," not only not inferior to foreign methods, but also has advantages that foreign methods do not have. This type of indigenous method is a supplement and development of foreign methods. In the future, it will not be from indigenous to foreign, but will be used in parallel, mutually infiltrate, and mutually supplement.

We must quickly cultivate a strong, both red and expert, scientific and technological team through the close combination of technical revolution, cultural revolution, and ideological revolution. Through the continuous development of such three combinations and three revolutions, we will definitely be able to cultivate a strong working-class scientific and technological team that is both red and expert in not too long a time. We will definitely be able to promote the continuous leap forward of our undertakings.

Zhang Jingfu finally said that the great helmsman who stands in front of the movement and guides our direction is our Party. As long as we all rely closely on the leadership of the Party, unite under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and carry out the mass movement of the whole nation running science more widely and deeply, we will definitely be able to realize the twelve-year science plan ahead of schedule, and we will definitely be able to climb to the highest peak of world science in not too long a time.

    全民办科学  更快登高峰
    张劲夫在全国文教先进工作者代表大会上讲话
    新华社6日讯　中国科学院副院长张劲夫今天上午在全国教育和文化、卫生、体育、新闻方面社会主义建设先进单位和先进工作者代表大会上以“全民办科学，更快登高峰”为题作了讲话。
    张劲夫把我国目前科学战线的主要形势概括为“全民办科学，连续大跃进”这一句话。他说，十一年来我国科学事业的一个根本变化，就是过去那种少数人冷冷清清搞科学研究的局面，已经一去不复返了，全民办科学的声势愈来愈壮阔。特别是由于以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的全民规模的技术革新技术革命运动蓬勃掀起以后，使科学研究与生产建设相结合的群众运动，走向了一个新阶段，形成一个历史上从未有过的全民的科学技术大普及运动，又是一个历史上从未有过的全民的科学技术大提高运动。目前运动还在发展，它的伟大意义和深远影响，时间愈久将会看得愈清楚；但就从运动的初步开展的情况来看，已经显出无比的威力，使我国的科学技术事业有了新的发展：第一，科学技术可以全面大搞群众运动。不仅一般技术可以大搞群众运动，就是新技术同样可以大搞群众运动，就是理论科学也可以大搞群众运动。第二，研究与应用密切结合，实行边研究、边设计、边试用、边推广、边改进的五边方法，打破了旧的机械划分阶段的办法，使许多研究成果一有了好用的苗头，迅速到生产中去运用推广，同时又依靠群众的智慧加以补充改进，使之更加完善。这样就使科学研究的进度大大加快并使成果迅速在生产建设中发生作用。第三，一面学习运用，一面发展创造。通过这样伟大生动、丰富多彩的群众性技术革新技术革命运动的实践，千千万人千千万次的实践试验，对于一切已有的科学技术知识进行着最深刻最严格的检验；并加以丰富，冲破了许多过时的旧的和不适用的理论和技术，发展和创造了许多新的理论、新的技术和新的工艺。第四，随着科学活动全民规模的发展，科学研究机构，如各种专业的或者兼业的研究所、研究室以至科学研究小组，广泛建立起来了。正在建成一个全国性的科学研究网。
    张劲夫说，科学工作的目前形势很好，但任务重大。社会主义建设高速度地发展和技术革命运动的蓬勃开展，一方面给予科学工作以很大的促进，另一方面又向科学工作提出更高的要求，就是要用更快的速度使我国工农业生产建设和国防建设立足于先进的科学技术基础之上。他说，“不快则退”，进而不快，就会拖后腿。必须加速跃进，才能适应形势要求，“高速更高速，跃进再跃进”，这就是我们科学工作者的信念和决心。
    张劲夫说，根据国家科学技术委员会的安排和部署，科学工作在1960年内，主要有以下几方面的任务：
    密切结合国家建设的需要，开展国民经济中重大科学技术问题的研究，加速实现工农业的技术改造。这是首要的任务。
    大力发展尖端科学技术的研究。尖端科学技术是现代科学中发展最迅速的部门，我国原有的基础太差，必须迎头赶上，尽快掌握世界上已有的先进成就，并发展新的创造。
    加强基本理论的研究工作。大跃进和技术革命运动，已经在生产技术上创造了许许多多的奇迹。其中有不少现象已经冲破了旧理论，孕育着新的科学理论。如果从理论上把这些问题研究清楚，就有可能进一步提高和发展那些创造发明，使它们在更广泛的范围内应用。在我国的建设事业中，许多独特的科学技术问题，依靠世界上已有的理论成果来解决，是有困难的，必须有我们自己的理论创造。同时，还有许多重要的科学理论领域，虽然目前还不一定就对生产实践起多么显著的作用，但是已经可以预见到它们将为人类明天、后天成百倍成千倍地提高生产力开辟途径。这一类工作也必须及早抓紧进行研究。
    张劲夫在讲话中谈到了高举毛泽东思想红旗进一步开展全民办科学的群众运动问题。他说，我国科学战线上的社会主义革命，是在毛泽东思想指导下取得胜利的。我国科学工作的道路，是在毛泽东思想指导下形成的。科学事业能够实现“全民办科学、连续大跃进”，这是毛泽东思想的胜利。
    毛泽东同志很早就向我们指出了科学事业高速度发展的必要与可能。早在1955年毛泽东同志就说过：“将来会出现从来没有被人们设想过的种种事业，几倍、十几倍，以至几十倍于现在的农作物的产量。工业、交通和交换事业的发展，更是前人所不能设想的。科学、文化、教育、卫生等项事业也是如此”。接着，在1956年初，毛泽东同志在中共中央召开的关于知识分子问题的会议上，发出了为迅速赶上世界科学先进水平而奋斗的伟大号召。这一号召，迅速地受到广大的工人、农民、知识分子的热情响应，开始了征服科学技术落后的伟大进军。在毛泽东思想的指导下，党的八大二次会议通过的“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线，和实现总路线的一整套两条腿走路的方针，为党领导科学事业提供了强有力的思想武器，开创了全党全民办科学的局面，使我国科学事业获得了最广泛最深刻的群众基础，从而揭开了我国科学发展史上高速度发展的新的一页。
    毛泽东同志指出了“卑贱者最聪明、高贵者最愚蠢”这一真理，提出了“解放思想，破除迷信”的号召，帮助了广大群众和科学工作者冲破了资产阶级科学传统的束缚，斫掉了妄自菲薄，树立了敢想、敢说、敢做的大无畏的首创精神。这种首创精神，对于高速度发展科学来说，是无价之宝。
    毛泽东同志关于理论和实践的辩证统一关系的学说，以及关于“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，揭示了科学发展的客观规律，启发人们自觉地去掌握和运用，从而把科学事业引向高度繁荣和活跃。
    毛泽东同志的哲学思想，不仅是指导我们进行社会阶级斗争的理论武器，同时也是指导我们进行向自然斗争的理论武器。
    从以上简单地说到的一些方面，已经可以有力地说明：毛泽东思想对于科学事业，具有不可估量的伟大作用和深远影响，是取之不尽，用之不竭的思想宝库。
    张劲夫说，为了把毛泽东思想的红旗进一步巩固地插在我们科学工作的所有领域里，进一步开展全民办科学的群众运动，我们还要抓紧以下的工作：
  不断解放思想。既要不断破除资产阶级科学传统束缚的框框，又要不断克服稍有成就就自满保守的思想。在全民办科学、连续大跃进的形势下，对于资产阶级的科学工作传统作法和制度，进行了群众性的声势浩大的冲击，把不适合于社会主义、不适合于多快好省的旧方法、旧制度破除掉，逐步建设起适合于我国社会主义科学事业特点的、适合于多快好省的一套新的工作方法、制度。但是对于资产阶级科学传统在思想上的束缚，并不是短期内就可以完全破除掉的，而是要在运动的发展过程中，不断进行革命，不断打破框框。
    发扬共产主义风格，加强共产主义的大协作；更好地把研究机构和工厂、学校结合起来，更好地把研究工作、教育工作和生产工作结合起来，更好地把研究人员和教员学生、工人农民结合起来。我们要遵循毛泽东同志提出的“在普及基础上提高，在提高指导下普及”的原则，和群众一起搞科学的大普及，同时又搞科学的大提高，依靠广大群众的千军万马，轰开局面，突破缺口；同时要抓住最有希望的苗头，抓住事物最主要的矛盾，进行细致深入的研究，巩固成果，并上升到理论的形态。
    科学研究也要大搞土洋结合。要大搞群众运动，就要土洋结合，土法上马。不大搞土法，就不能大搞群众运动。过去有些科学技术之所以不能广泛在群众中推广使用，形成群众运动，重要原因之一就是因为受了“洋设备”条件的限制。不突破这一框框，科学研究的群众运动就很难广泛地开展起来。所谓“土”，要有新的看法。有一类“土”，是比较初级简单的东西，先上马，以后逐步改进提高，由初级到高级，由简单粗糙到精密。还有一类“土”，则是土生土长的，带有重大的创造性。看起来简单，但原理是很先进的，“深入浅出”，不仅不比洋法差，而且还有洋法所没有的优点。这类土法，是洋法的补充和发展，今后不是由土到洋，而是要土洋并用，互相渗透，互为补充。
    要通过技术革命、文化革命和思想革命的密切结合，迅速培养出一支强大的又红又专的科学技术队伍。通过这样的三个结合和三个革命的不断发展，我们就一定能在不要很长的时间内，培养出一支又红又专的强大的工人阶级科学技术队伍。就一定能够推动我们的事业连续大跃进。
    张劲夫最后说，站在运动前面指引我们前进方向的伟大舵手是我们的党。只要我们大家紧紧依靠党的领导，团结在毛泽东思想旗帜下，更为广阔深入地开展全民办科学的群众运动，我们就一定能够提前实现十二年科学规划，一定能够在不太长的时间内攀登世界科学的最高峰。
