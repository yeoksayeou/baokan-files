Commune Nursery Rhymes
    Wen Bing

    Little sickle for picking wild vegetables,
    Cuts so fast, my brother and I pick wild vegetables;
    Shepherd's purse, daylilies,
    We'll carry a load to the street to sell.
    I sell wild vegetables, don't want money,
    Especially for the commune's animal keeper!

    Accumulating fertilizer, East Team,
    Accumulating fertilizer, West Team,
    A massive army makes fertilizer;
    Uncle's team, Aunt's team,
    Grandpa's, Grandma's, Elderly team;
    Everyone shouts "Add oil!",
    Everyone is as fast as flying;
    We're small but don't fall behind,
    Our little legs chase after Dad...

    Innovation Home
    Dad is an innovator,
    The cart hauls soil without pulling.
    Mom is also an innovator,
    Turn on the switch and spin yarn.
    Brother is also an innovator,
    Automatic pumping, gurgling.
    Grandma is also an innovator,
    Sewing soles with a foot pedal.
    Everyone becomes an innovator,
    Every household hangs red flowers at the door!

    挑野菜小镰刀，割得快，我和弟弟挑野菜；荠荠菜，黄花菜，挑它一担上街卖。我卖野菜不要钱，专送公社饲养员！
    积肥东一队，西一队，千军万马闹积肥；叔叔队，姑姑队，爷爷奶奶老人队；人人喊加油，个个快如飞；我们人小不落后，小腿直把爸爸追……。
    革新家爸爸是个革新家，车子运土不用拉。妈妈也是革新家，电门一开纺起纱。哥哥也是革新家，自动抽水哗哗哗。奶奶也是革新家，纳起鞋底用脚踏。人人都成革新家，户户门口挂红花！
