    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 14th: The National Movement Liaison Council for Solving the Okinawa Problem, composed of Japanese groups from all walks of life, today published an open letter to U.S. President Eisenhower, demanding that the United States immediately return Okinawa to Japan.

    The open letter listed a large number of facts and strongly condemned the serious disasters caused to the people of Okinawa by the U.S. military's occupation of Okinawa. For example, U.S. military aircraft frequently crash, endangering the lives and property of the Okinawan people; the U.S. military also forcibly requisitioned farmers' land to build bases, and deprived the Okinawan people of freedom of thought, assembly, speech, and publication, etc.

    The open letter demanded that the United States respect the wishes of the 850,000 Okinawan people, not bring nuclear weapons into Okinawa, and immediately stop expanding military bases.

    The National Movement Liaison Council for Solving the Okinawa Problem today sent three representatives to deliver the open letter to the U.S. Embassy in Japan.

    The representatives also met with Koichi Nakamura, Vice-Speaker of the Japanese House of Representatives, and asked the Japanese government to take measures to urge the United States to return Okinawa to Japan as soon as possible.
