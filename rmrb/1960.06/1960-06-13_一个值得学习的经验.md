    A Worthy Experience to Learn From
    廖由滨
    The Salachi People's Commune Health Center in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has been able to run a small, poorly equipped hospital well with a faster, better, and more economical approach, mainly because they relied on the leadership of the Party, launched a vigorous mass movement, and eliminated the idea that rural conditions were backward. In the early days of the hospital's establishment, it could be said that they started from scratch, without even the smallest equipment such as instrument tables, sponge forceps, and bowel depressors in the operating room. However, the Party leadership of this hospital was not restricted by the backward conditions. Through vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution, they fully utilized the enthusiasm and wisdom of the masses, turning unfavorable conditions into favorable ones, and "substituting local methods for foreign ones," solving one by one the things that were originally thought to be unsolvable. This shows that rural hospitals with poor conditions can be greatly improved through subjective efforts.
    The Salachi Health Center also focused on the training of technical personnel while changing the backward situation of rural hospitals. Their attitude towards this issue was not to wait for the state to send technical personnel, or to be content with the current situation where they could not treat any difficult or complicated diseases. Instead, they actively adopted a series of two-pronged approaches such as running schools in the hospital, studying while working, masters teaching apprentices, and experienced workers leading new workers to train personnel. As a result, a large number of technically skilled personnel were trained from the existing staff in five months. Those who were originally thought to have low levels of education and unable to learn technology also learned it, thereby raising the commune's medical technology to a new level. Now, they can perform many kinds of surgeries and treat many kinds of difficult and complicated diseases. As of January of this year, among the more than forty types and ninety cases of surgeries they performed, such as appendicitis, cesarean section, intestinal obstruction, gastrointestinal perforation, and joint resection, the rate of primary healing was 92.2%. This fact once again eloquently proves that as long as people's soaring enthusiasm is brought into play, backwardness can be transformed into advancement.
    The experience of the Salachi Commune Health Center in breaking the "theory of backward conditions" and running the hospital from small to large, from backward to advanced with a faster, better, and more economical approach, is worth learning from by other commune hospitals across the country.

    一个值得学习的经验
    廖由滨
    内蒙古自治区萨拉齐人民公社卫生院，能够采取多快好省的办法，把一个设备十分简陋的小医院办好，主要是他们依靠了党的领导，大搞群众运动，破除了农村条件落后论的思想。在医院成立初期，可以说完全是白手起家，连手术室里的器械台、海绵箝子和压肠板等最小的设备都没有。但是这个医院党的领导没有被落后的条件限制住，经过轰轰烈烈的大搞技术革新和技术革命，充分发挥了群众的干劲和智慧，就把不利条件化为有利条件，“以土代洋”，将原先认为不能够解决的一些东西都一一解决了，这说明条件不好的农村医院，只要经过主观的努力，就会大大改观。
    萨拉齐卫生院在改变农村医院的落后面貌中，还抓住了技术人材的培养工作。他们对待这个问题的态度不是等待国家给输送技术人材，或者是安于目前对什么疑难病症也不能治疗的现状，而是积极采取在医院办学校，一面工作一面学习、师傅带徒弟、老手带新手等一系列的两条腿走路的办法培养人材，结果五个月就从现有的人员中培养出了大批懂技术的人材，原先认为文化水平低、学不会技术的也都学会了，从而把公社医疗技术提高到了一个新的水平。现在，他们已经能动很多种手术和医治很多种疑难病症了。到今年1月份为止，他们所做的阑尾炎、剖腹产、肠梗阻、胃肠穿孔、关节切除等四十多种、九十例手术中，第一期愈合就占92．2％，这一事实再一次雄辩地说明：只要发挥出了人们的冲天干劲，落后也会变成先进。
    萨拉齐公社卫生院能够大破“条件落后论”而多快好省地把医院由小办大，由落后到先进，这个经验，是值得全国其他各地公社医院学习的。
