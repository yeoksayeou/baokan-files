    New Songs from the Wheat Field
    He Bo
    Beneath the blue sky of the wheat field, a vast ocean of wheat; oh, great commune, I praise your broad embrace. The dawn breeze blows gently from the horizon, the wheat waves roll, like surging sea waves. Seeing these thousands of layers of wheat waves, and this boundless wheat sea, the commune members' hearts are as happy as flying birds, the harvest songs are sung with such boldness. On the edge of this vast wheat sea, I truly feel like I have entered a wondrous realm; ah, it is the Party that leads us in tenacious struggle, turning our motherland's land into a golden sea.

    Combine Operator
    Young combine operator, I see you are inspecting the machine; your face is filled with joy, yet you are solemnly preparing for the wheat harvesting battle. This red combine harvester, do you know how long we have been waiting for it? Now the commune uses it to harvest, relying entirely on your skillful mind and strong hands. The combine is like your divine ox, and like your light boat sailing on the wheat sea; you are truly a giant from mythology, able to pile wheat into hills in the blink of an eye. The wheat, ah, is almost ripe, gently greeting you in the breeze; they want to safely enter the granary immediately, bowing their heads to you, with shy faces. Young combine operator, I see you are inspecting the machine; you love the wheat, and are preparing for the harvest battle.

    麦海新歌
    禾波
    麦海蓝色的天幕下，一片小麦的大海；伟大的公社啊，我赞美你宽阔的胸怀。黎明的清风，从天边阵阵吹来，麦浪滚滚，好像海波澎湃。看见这千层麦浪，和这无边的麦海，社员的心乐得像鸟飞翔，丰收的歌曲唱得多么豪迈。在这浩淼的麦海边上，我真像进到奇异的境界；啊，是党领导我们顽强战斗，把祖国的土地变成黄金的大海。
    康拜因手年轻的康拜因手啊，我看见你正在把机器检修；你的脸上洋溢着欢乐，却庄严地准备着麦收的战斗。这红色的联合收割机，你知道我们盼望了多久？如今公社用它来收割，全靠你灵巧的心和有力的手。康拜因像你的神牛，又像你航行麦海的轻舟；你真是神话中的巨人，能把小麦转眼间堆成山丘。小麦啊，已快成熟，在微风中向你轻声问候；它们想马上安全地进入粮仓，向你低垂着头，面带娇羞。年轻的康拜因手啊，我看见你正在把机器检修；你热爱小麦，正准备着丰收的战斗。
