Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, June 22nd.  Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Assembly of Albania, Haxhi Lleshi, and other distinguished Albanian guests, successfully concluded their visit to China and left Shenyang by special plane at 8:00 this morning to visit the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Today, the national flags of China and Albania flew in the wind over the Dongta Airport in Shenyang. After Haxhi Lleshi and other distinguished guests arrived at the airport, the military band played the national anthems of China and Albania. Chairman Lleshi, accompanied by Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Saifuddin, and Vice Governor of Liaoning Province, Huang Da, reviewed the honor guard.

Vice Chairman Saifuddin delivered a farewell speech. He said that Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Assembly of Albania, Haxhi Lleshi, and other distinguished guests, who came to our country for a friendly visit at the invitation of Chairman Liu Shaoqi, are about to leave our country. We are here with boundless reluctance to bid farewell to them, and we ask the distinguished guests to convey the cordial greetings of the Chinese people to the fraternal Albanian people.

Saifuddin said that during Chairman Haxhi Lleshi's stay in our country, he visited cities and villages, visited factories, urban and rural people's communes, and cultural and educational undertakings, and personally saw the life and labor of the Chinese people, as well as the Chinese people's love and respect for the fraternal Albanian people. The Chinese people have been greatly encouraged by the friendly visit of the distinguished Albanian guests from the fraternal country. Saifuddin said that Chairman Haxhi Lleshi's visit has greatly developed and strengthened the deep fraternal friendship between China and Albania. The increasing unity between China and Albania, based on Marxism-Leninism, will further strengthen the great unity and strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and give a strong blow to the imperialist camp headed by the United States and modern revisionism. Please allow me to convey here again Chairman Liu Shaoqi's deep gratitude to Chairman Haxhi Lleshi, Comrade Liri Belishova, and other Albanian comrades for visiting our country and for the significant contributions they have made to strengthening the fraternal friendship between our two peoples.

Finally, Saifuddin wished the heroic Albanian people even more brilliant achievements in the socialist construction of their motherland.

Next, Chairman Haxhi Lleshi delivered a farewell speech. He said that our visit to your great and hospitable country is coming to an end. During our stay in fraternal China, we have received a very warm, sincere, and fraternal reception wherever we went. This reception is a manifestation of the friendship and love of the fraternal Chinese people for the Albanian people.

Chairman Lleshi said that during our stay in China, we saw the tremendous and amazing achievements made by the talented Chinese people in all aspects of life in a short period of time under the leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong. What impressed us most was the drive and enthusiasm shown by the Chinese people in their labor, and the organization and determination shown in their great strides forward on the road to socialism and communism.

He said that China is becoming stronger year by year, her international prestige is increasing day by day, and her role as an important factor in defending and strengthening peace in Asia and the world is growing. We sincerely wish the great Chinese people new achievements on the road to socialism and communism, and wish the sacred territory of China, Taiwan, to return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible.

Chairman Lleshi said that under the present conditions, the continuous growth and strengthening of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, the firmness and vigilance of our people, the struggle of the people of all countries to seek liberation, and the broad movement of peace-loving people, hinder the imperialists from realizing their aggressive plans, and the imperialists and their running dogs, the Yugoslav modern revisionists, will inevitably be defeated. The future belongs to us, to the victory of Marxist-Leninist thought.

He said, I would like to thank Comrade Liu Shaoqi once again for inviting us to visit fraternal China.

After the speech, Chairman Lleshi and other distinguished guests walked to the front of the welcoming crowd to bid farewell to the masses. At this time, the lined-up masses waved colorful flags and shouted slogans such as "Farewell to Chairman Lleshi" and "Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Albanian people," expressing their high respect to Chairman Lleshi and the Albanian distinguished guests, and wishing them a safe journey. Before boarding the plane, Chairman Lleshi and other distinguished guests accepted flowers from the Young Pioneers.

Also at the airport to see them off today were Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei, Chinese Ambassador to Albania Luo Shigao, and Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Yu Peiwen.

Also at the airport to see them off were Li Huang, Li Dongye, Secretaries of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Ning Wu, Vice Governor of Liaoning Province, Wang Bojing, Secretary of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Liu Baotian, Mayor of Shenyang, General Chen Xilian, Commander of the Shenyang Garrison, and other party and government leaders, as well as heads of local organizations of various democratic parties and people's organizations.

Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd.  Chairman Liu Shaoqi received a letter from Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Assembly of Albania, Haxhi Lleshi, when he left our country, in which he expressed his gratitude for the warm and fraternal reception received in China. The full text of the letter is as follows: Beijing, Dear Comrade Liu Shaoqi:

As we leave your great country, please allow me to express once again my deep and heartfelt gratitude to you, on my own behalf and on behalf of the comrades who accompanied me. Thank you, Comrade Mao Zedong, and other leading comrades of the Party and the state, and the fraternal Chinese people, for the warm and fraternal reception given to us during our stay in China. The achievements of the Chinese people, the great friendship and love of the Chinese people for the Albanian people have left us with a very deep impression, and it is with this impression that we leave your country. Comrade Chairman, I assure you that the Albanian people also have the same feelings for the great and talented Chinese people.

We wish the fraternal Chinese people new and greater victories in socialist construction, in the struggle for their prosperity, for the prosperity of the entire socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and in the struggle to defend and strengthen peace, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong.

Goodbye!

    列希主席结束对我国的访问
    写信给刘少奇主席感谢对他的热情接待
    新华社沈阳22日电　阿尔巴尼亚人民议会主席团主席哈奇·列希和阿尔巴尼亚其他贵宾，圆满地结束了在中国的访问，于今天上午八时乘专机离开沈阳，前往朝鲜民主主义人民共和国访问。
    今天，沈阳东塔机场上空迎风飘扬着中阿两国国旗。哈奇·列希等贵宾来到机场后，军乐队奏中阿两国国歌。列希主席由人大常委会副委员长赛福鼎、辽宁省副省长黄达陪同检阅了仪仗队。
    赛福鼎副委员长致欢送词。他说，应刘少奇主席的邀请，前来我国进行友好访问的阿尔巴尼亚人民议会主席团主席哈奇·列希等贵宾，即将离开我国。我们怀着无限惜别的心情在这里欢送他们，并请贵宾们把中国人民的亲切的问候带给兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民。
    赛福鼎说，哈奇·列希主席在我国逗留期间，访问了城市和乡村，参观了工厂、城乡人民公社和文化教育事业，亲眼看到了中国人民的生活和劳动情况，以及中国人民对兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民的爱戴和敬佩。中国人民从来自兄弟之邦的阿尔巴尼亚贵宾的友好访问中，得到了极大的鼓舞。赛福鼎说，哈奇·列希主席的这次访问，大大发展和加强了中阿两国兄弟般的深厚友谊。中阿两国以马克思列宁主义为基础的团结的日益增强，必将进一步加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结和力量，给美国为首的帝国主义阵营和现代修正主义以有力的打击。请允许我在这里转达刘少奇主席再一次向哈奇·列希主席、利丽·贝利绍娃同志和其他阿尔巴尼亚同志表示深切的谢意，感谢你们访问我国和对加强我们两国人民的兄弟友谊所做出的重大贡献。
    赛福鼎最后祝英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民在自己祖国的社会主义建设中取得更加辉煌的成就。
    接着，哈奇·列希主席发表了告别讲话。他说，我们在你们伟大的、热情好客的国家的访问就要结束了。在兄弟的中国逗留期间，我们不论到什么地方，都受到了非常热情、诚恳和兄弟般的接待。这种接待是兄弟的中国人民对阿尔巴尼亚人民友好和热爱的表现。
    列希主席说，在中国逗留期间，我们看到了在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党领导下的天才的中国人民，在短短的时期内，在生活的各个方面所取得的巨大的令人惊异的成就。给我们印象最深刻的是中国人民在劳动中表现出的干劲和热情，在社会主义和共产主义道路上大踏步前进中所表现的组织性和坚定性。
    他说，中国变得一年比一年更加强大，她的国际威望日益提高，她作为保卫和加强亚洲和全世界和平重要因素的作用日益增强。我们衷心预祝伟大的中国人民在迈向社会主义和共产主义道路上取得新的成就，并祝中国神圣的领土台湾，早日重返祖国的怀抱。
    列希主席说，在现今条件下，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营力量不断壮大和团结的加强，我们人民的坚定性和警惕性，各国人民的谋求解放的斗争，以及和平人士的广泛运动，阻碍帝国主义者实现其侵略计划，帝国主义及其走狗南斯拉夫现代修正主义者，必将遭到失败。未来属于我们的，属于马克思列宁主义思想的胜利。
    他说，我要再一次感谢刘少奇同志邀请我们访问兄弟中国。
    讲话结束后，列希主席等贵宾走向欢送群众行列的前面与群众告别。这时，列队的群众挥舞着彩旗，不断高呼：“欢送列希主席”“中阿两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁”等口号，向列希主席和阿尔巴尼亚贵宾们表示崇高的敬意，并祝他们一路平安。列希主席等贵宾登机前，接受了少先队员们的献花。
    今天到机场欢送的还有，外交部副部长姬鹏飞、我国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使罗士高、外交部礼宾司司长俞沛文。
    到机场欢送的还有，中共辽宁省委书记李荒、李东冶，辽宁省副省长宁武，中共沈阳市委书记王伯瑾，沈阳市市长刘宝田，沈阳驻军首长陈锡联上将等党政负责人，以及各民主党派地方组织、各人民团体的负责人等。
    新华社22日讯　刘少奇主席收到了阿尔巴尼亚人民议会主席团主席哈奇·列希在离开我国的时候写给他的一封信，信中对在中国受到热情的兄弟般的接待，表示感谢。信的全文如下：北京亲爱的刘少奇同志：
    当我们离开你们伟大的国家时，请允许我以我个人的名义，并代表随同我的同志们再一次向你表示深切的、衷心的谢意。感谢你和毛泽东同志以及党和国家的其他领导同志和兄弟的中国人民，在我们逗留中国的期间所给予我们的热情的兄弟般的接待。中国人民的成就，中国人民对阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大友谊和热爱给了我们非常深刻的印象，我们就是带着这种印象离开你们国家的。主席同志，我向你保证，阿尔巴尼亚人民对伟大的、天才的中国人民也怀着同样的感情。
    我们祝兄弟的中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的英明领导下，在社会主义建设中，在为自己的繁荣，为以苏联为首的整个社会主义阵营的繁荣，在保卫和加强和平的斗争中取得新的更大的胜利。
