Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 16th: The government of the German Democratic Republic today issued a statement regarding the continuous revanchist gatherings in West Germany and West Berlin, warning against the revanchist agitation in West Germany. It also reminded the people of Europe, especially the peace-loving residents of West Germany and West Berlin, that the actions of revanchist and fascist elements in West Germany and West Berlin must be stopped.

The statement said that revenge has become the official national policy of the Bonn government. The "Landsmannschaften" (homeland associations) directed and funded by the Bonn government are political organizations preparing for revanchist war adventures. No one should ignore the danger that such actions by West German militarists and revanchist politicians pose to peace in Germany and Europe.

The statement said that under the protection of the Western occupation regime, West Berlin is, under Adenauer's instructions, preparing for revanchist war against the People's Republic of Poland and the German Democratic Republic.

The statement emphasized that the entire military leadership of the West German forces in NATO is filled with the spirit of revenge. Soldiers and officers are being mobilized to follow Strauss's example and actively participate in revanchist gatherings.

The statement concluded that concluding a peace treaty with the two Germanys is the best way to stop West German militarism and revanchism and to safeguard peace in Europe.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 14th: According to today's "Neues Deutschland," Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, said at the Greater Berlin District Party Congress on the 11th that eliminating the danger point in West Berlin is an urgent matter. He said that these danger points are still under the wings of foreign occupying authorities. Ulbricht also put forward five key points for changing the status quo of West Berlin.

In his speech, Ulbricht warned the Adenauer government that the German Democratic Republic would not be satisfied with defending itself from domestic hostile activities, but would also have to keep an eye on the bases that organize hostile activities.

Ulbricht then said that looking at the map, it is clear that the United States or Bonn has no reason to interfere in Berlin. However, the government of the German Democratic Republic is willing to make major concessions and proposes that West Berlin become a demilitarized free city. Ulbricht said that the German Democratic Republic would never do anything to harm the residents of West Berlin, but would do everything in its power to fight against the activities of the American and other countries' intelligence agencies in West Berlin.

Ulbricht said that the changes that must be made in West Berlin can be summarized in the following five points:

(1) No rocket weapons may be stored in West Berlin, and no troops may be recruited there for the West German Federal Defense Forces.

(2) Foreign troops must gradually withdraw. The Soviet Union has guaranteed that when the troops of Western countries withdraw from West Berlin, Soviet troops will immediately withdraw from the democratic sector of Berlin.

(3) The occupation status of West Berlin must end. The government of the German Democratic Republic is unwilling to allow the status quo of West Berlin to continue indefinitely.

(4) The West Berlin spy centers that conduct sabotage activities against the German Democratic Republic must be eliminated. The German Democratic Republic does not object to the establishment of a Four-Power supervisory body if this body can supervise the elimination of spy centers and the cessation of any hostile activities in West Berlin.

(5) West Berlin must become a truly free city in which West German law is invalid. It must have the right to conclude agreements with various countries.

Ulbricht said that after the German Democratic Republic concludes a peace treaty with those countries that are willing to conclude one with it, it will continue to seek a peaceful solution to the West Berlin problem. After the signing of the treaty, the German Democratic Republic will take over control of the Western countries' military lines of communication to West Berlin.

In his speech, Ulbricht also said that striving for united action by the entire German working class is one of the important tasks at present. He said that the basic contradiction in Germany is the contradiction between the interests of the imperialist bourgeoisie in West Germany and the interests of the working class and peace-loving masses. Therefore, it is possible and necessary to unite the working class throughout Germany and to establish fraternal relations between the working people of the two Germanys in the direction pointed out by the "People's Plan on the German Question."

    德国政府就西德和西柏林法西斯活动发表声明
    必须制止西德复仇主义活动
    乌布利希提出改变西柏林现状五项要点
    新华社柏林16日讯　德意志民主共和国政府今天就西德和西柏林不断举行复仇主义集会发表声明说，德意志民主共和国政府对西德的复仇主义煽动提出警告，并提醒欧洲人民，特别是西德和西柏林的爱好和平的居民：西德和西柏林复仇主义和法西斯分子的行为必须加以制止。
    声明说，复仇已经变成波恩政府的正式国家政策了。由波恩政府所指使和资助的“同乡会”是准备复仇主义战争冒险的政治组织。任何人都不应该忽视西德军国主义者和复仇政客们的这种行径给德国和欧洲和平所带来的危险。
    声明说，西柏林在西方占领制度的庇护下，正根据阿登纳的指示，为反对波兰人民共和国和德意志民主共和国进行复仇主义的战争准备。
    声明着重指出，北大西洋集团的西德部队的全部军事将领都充满了复仇精神。士兵和军官被动员追随施特劳斯的榜样，积极参加复仇主义分子的集会。
    声明最后说，同两个德国缔结和约是制止西德军国主义和复仇主义以及保障欧洲和平最好的道路。
    新华社柏林14日电　据今天的“新德意志报”报道，德国统一社会党中央第一书记乌布利希11日在大柏林区党代表会议上讲话时说，消除在西柏林的危险点，是迫不及待的事。他说，这些危险点至今仍然处于外国占领当局的卵翼之下。乌布利希还提出了改变西柏林现状的五项要点。
    乌布利希在讲话中向阿登纳政府提出警告说，德意志民主共和国将不满足于保卫自己不受国内敌对活动的侵扰，而且不得不注视那些组织敌对活动的基地。
    乌布利希接着说，看一下地图就明白，美国或者波恩丝毫没有理由干涉柏林。但是，德意志民主共和国政府愿意作出重大让步，而建议西柏林成为非军事化的自由城市。乌布利希说，德意志民主共和国决不会作出任何伤害西柏林居民的事，但是，针对美国及其他国家在西柏林的特务机构的活动，德意志民主共和国将竭尽一切努力进行斗争。
    乌布利希说，西柏林必须进行的改变，可以归结为下列五点：
    （一）不得在西柏林储存火箭武器，不得在那里为西德联邦国防军招募军队。
    （二）外国军队必须逐步撤退。苏联已经保证，当西方国家的军队撤出西柏林时，苏联军队将立即从柏林民主区撤退。
    （三）必须结束西柏林的占领状态。德意志民主共和国政府决不愿意让西柏林现状无限期地继续下去。
    （四）必须消除针对德意志民主共和国进行破坏活动的西柏林间谍中心。德意志民主共和国不反对建立四大国监督机构，如果这个机构在消除间谍中心和制止在西柏林进行的任何敌对活动方面能够监督的话。
    （五）西柏林必须成为真正的自由城市，在这个城市中西德的法律无效。它必须有权同各个国家缔结协定。
    乌布利希说，在德意志民主共和国同那些愿意同它缔结和约的国家缔结对德和约以后，它仍将继续寻求和平解决西柏林问题的办法。在签订和约以后，德意志民主共和国将接管西方国家通往西柏林的军事交通线的控制权。
    乌布利希在讲话中还说，争取全德国工人阶级行动一致是当前重要任务之一。他说，德国的基本矛盾是西德帝国主义资产阶级利益同工人阶级和爱好和平群众的利益之间的矛盾。因此，这就有可能和有必要团结德国各地的工人阶级，并且按照“人民关于德国问题的计划”所指出的方向建立两个德国劳动人民之间的兄弟关系。
