Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 28th: Saigon Dispatch: Under the influence of the rising struggle of the South Vietnamese people against the US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique, many soldiers in the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem puppet army are growing increasingly disgusted with the US-Diem clique. They are deserting and refusing to carry out "suppression" orders.

According to reports from South Vietnam cited by newspapers here today, in the southern part of central Vietnam, the US-Diem clique tricked soldiers from a regiment into believing they were being transferred to Hue. However, when they arrived in Quang Ngai Province, the US-Diem clique forced them to carry out "suppression" operations, which was met with resolute resistance from the soldiers of this regiment.

The report also stated that most of the soldiers in a platoon of puppet troops stationed in My Tho village, Cao Lanh district, Phong Thinh province, recently deserted. A platoon of the local "Security Forces" also threw down their weapons and refused to conduct "suppression" operations in Phong My district. Soldiers in Hong Ngu district also resolutely resisted "suppression" orders. In Long Xuyen province, many South Vietnamese puppet soldiers left their strongholds and handed over their weapons to the people.

    新华社河内28日电　西贡消息：在南越人民反对美国——吴庭艳集团的日益高涨的斗争情绪的影响下，南越吴庭艳伪军中不少士兵对美吴集团的厌恶情绪正在增长。他们纷纷逃跑和拒绝执行“扫荡”命令。
    据此间报纸今天援引来自南越的消息说，在中部南面地区，美吴集团哄骗一个团的士兵要他们开到顺化去；但是到了广义省，美吴集团却强迫他们进行“扫荡”，结果受到这个团的士兵坚决的抗拒。
    消息还说，驻在丰盛省高领县美寿乡的伪军一个排的大部分士兵最近纷纷逃跑。地方“保安团”的一个排也把枪扔掉，拒绝到风美区进行“扫荡”。鸿御县的士兵也坚决抗拒“扫荡”的命令。在隆川省，南越伪军许多士兵离开据点把武器缴给了人民。
