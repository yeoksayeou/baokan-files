Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, June 2nd: With the rainy season arriving, Fujian is launching a mass movement to prevent floods, fight droughts, and ensure a bumper harvest. Currently, hundreds of thousands of people fighting on various water conservancy construction sites and along river and sea dikes are rushing to repair flood control and water storage projects. At the same time, they are strengthening the inspection and patrol of mountain ponds, reservoirs, and dikes. Under the slogans "Seize the sunny days, make the most of rainy days," "The flood rises one foot, our will rises ten feet, defeat the floods and ensure a bumper harvest," local workers have recently rushed to complete 3.42 million cubic meters of earth and stone work in the past ten days or so, allowing most newly built water conservancy projects to exceed the flood control water level and expand the area benefiting by 19,000 mu. Nanping, Fu'an, Longxi and other regions have also renovated a large number of field drainage and irrigation projects in conjunction with flood prevention and drought resistance.

Since May, Fujian has experienced continuous overcast and rainy weather, with occasional heavy rains and torrential downpours. The water levels of all rivers have risen sharply, and many streams and rivers have exceeded the warning levels.

This year, Party committees at all levels have strengthened the leadership of flood prevention and drought resistance work early on, and strengthened the work of flood prevention headquarters at all levels. In Minhou County, located in the lower reaches of the Minjiang River, more than 5,500 cadres went to the grassroots level to mobilize the masses to prepare a large number of flood prevention materials such as sacks and wooden stakes. All of the county's 1,650 mountain ponds and reservoirs, 123 kilometers of sea dikes and river dikes have also been fully renovated and reinforced. Longxi and Haicheng counties, located in the lower reaches of the Jiulong River, organized tens of thousands of people into flood prevention and drought resistance shock teams to promptly wash seedlings and replant flooded fields, and to drain ditches in more than 189,000 mu of rice fields that might be lodged to prevent lodging.

All localities have paid special attention to the flood control work of key projects. In addition to contracting the reinforcement and maintenance of completed key projects at different levels and sections, they have also concentrated superior labor, materials and equipment to rush the repair of unfinished key water conservancy projects, and built dams and embankments above the flood level as soon as possible.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, June 2nd: Hunan Province has entered a tense period of flood prevention. Party committees at all levels are mobilizing the masses to actively prepare flood prevention materials and rush to complete the reinforcement of water conservancy projects. The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a decision on May 26 regarding the immediate launch of a major inspection of flood prevention and drought resistance. A flood prevention and drought resistance inspection team was established, personally directed by Zhou Hui, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, and dispatched to Changde, Xiangtan, Shaoyang, Hengyang, Chenzhou and other six regions to inspect flood prevention work.

This year's flood prevention and drought resistance work was planned early and started early. After achieving great victories in the mass water conservancy campaign, all localities, based on the new situation of many projects, large scale, and wide distribution, carried out inspection and acceptance work, and assigned flood prevention and drought resistance tasks at all levels. Flood prevention headquarters have been established in all special districts, cities, counties, and communes in the lake area, headed by the Party committee secretary himself. Flood prevention brigades were established at the brigade level, flood prevention squadrons at the production team level, and flood prevention professional teams at the polder level, with a total of more than 460,000 flood prevention and rescue personnel. In mountainous and hilly areas, 10,882 flood prevention and rescue teams were established with reservoirs as units, organizing more than 500,000 laborers in total. Shaoyang District has formed 2,916 flood control and rescue teams with more than 500,000 people.

During flood prevention, many places inspected the main structures of large and medium-sized projects, such as the dam quality, flood control standards, and water discharge equipment, item by item, and adopted countermeasures according to different situations. The hidden dangers of dangerous works on the dikes in the lake area are being urgently addressed. Hengyang District generally inspected the dangerous works, unfinished works, ideological preparations, organizational structure, and material preparations. Through the inspection, cadres and the masses have greatly improved their understanding of doing a good job in flood prevention and drought resistance, and immediately repaired projects that did not meet the standards. Chenzhou District's flood prevention and drought resistance inspection has been carried out repeatedly four or five times, and more than 300 problematic reservoirs have been dealt with, opening spillways, reinforcing dams, and consolidating the achievements of the water conservancy movement. In order to prevent mountain floods from collapsing reservoirs and ponds, Longhui County opened 130,000 mountain-encircling ditches. Changsha County also seized the favorable opportunity before the arrival of the major flood peak and built a one-meter-high sub-dike on all the major dikes. Drainage ditches have been prepared in general dike sections. At the same time, the flood prevention tasks of the reservoirs were assigned to individuals, contracts were signed, and cards were established. In conjunction with the flood prevention and rescue in mid-May, all communes conducted flood prevention exercises.

All localities have also prepared flood control materials. Sixteen large and medium-sized reservoirs in Dongkou County have prepared 868 cubic meters of timber for flood control, more than 12,000 cubic meters of Taiping soil, and more than 4,500 bundles of firewood. All localities vigorously raised funds for materials based on the principles of focusing on soil, combining indigenous and foreign methods, using local materials, and self-reliance. All localities in the lake area cleared the original flood control materials and newly collected 130,000 cubic meters of sand and gravel, 570,000 grass bags, and 17.85 million bundles of reed stalks. Water conservancy projects in mountainous and hilly areas have also collected a large number of timber, sand and gravel, and grass bags.

    加强领导　备足器材　突击扫尾工程
    福建湖南防汛抗洪保丰收
    新华社福州2日电　雨季来到，福建各地正在开展防汛抗洪保丰收的群众运动。目前，奋战在各水利建设工地和江、海堤防上的几十万防汛抗洪大军，正在突击抢修防洪蓄水工程，同时加强山塘水库和堤防的检查巡逻工作。各地民工在“抓晴天，抢雨天”“洪高一尺，志高一丈，战胜洪汛保丰收”的口号下，最近十多天来冒雨突击抢修的土石方工程有三百四十二万多立方米，使大部分新修水利工程超出拦洪水位，并扩大受益面积一万九千亩。南平、福安和龙溪等专区还结合防汛抗洪整修了大量田间排灌工程。
    5月以来，福建各地阴雨连绵，并时有大雨和暴雨出现，各江河暴涨，许多溪河水位都超过警戒水位。
    各级党委今年都及早加强了防汛抗洪工作的领导，加强了各级防汛指挥部的工作。地处闽江下游的闽侯县有五千五百多名干部深入基层，发动群众准备了大批麻袋、木桩等防汛抗洪物资。全县的一千六百五十个山塘水库、一百二十三公里的海堤和江堤也进行了全面地整修加固。九龙江下游的龙溪、海澄等县组织了数万人的防汛抗洪突击队及时给受淹田地洗苗补种，并在可能倒伏的十八万九千多亩的稻田中开沟排水，以防止倒伏。
    各地都特别重视重点工程的拦洪防汛工作，除了对已经完工的重点工程分层分段包干加固维修外，还集中优势劳力物资和器材突击抢修未完工的重点水利工程，及早把大坝和堤岸修出洪水位。
    新华社长沙2日电　湖南省已进入紧张的防汛时期，各级党委发动群众积极准备防汛器材，突击水利工程的加固扫尾工作。中共湖南省委在5月26日发出了关于立即开展防汛防洪大检查的决定。并成立了防汛防洪检查团，由省委书记周惠亲自指挥，分赴常德、湘潭、邵阳、衡阳、郴州等六个专区检查防汛工作。
    今年的防汛、防洪工作规划早，动手早。各地在取得大兴水利运动的伟大胜利后，即根据工程多、规模大、分布广的新情况，开展了检查验收工作，并层层布置了防汛防洪任务。湖区各专、市、县、公社的防汛指挥部都已先后成立，由党委书记亲自挂帅。并以大队为单位，成立了防汛大队，以生产队为单位，成立防汛中队，以垸为单位，成立防汛专业队，共有防汛抢险队员四十六万多人。山区丘陵区还以水库为单位，成立了防汛抢险队一万零八百八十二个，共组织劳力五十多万人。邵阳专区已组成防洪抢险队二千九百一十六个，人数达五十万人以上。
    在防汛中，很多地方对大、中型工程的大坝质量、防洪标准与放水设备等主体建筑物，逐项进行了检验，并分别不同情况，采取对策。湖区大堤上的险工隐患，正在加紧处理。衡阳专区普遍检查了险工尾工、思想准备、组织机构和器材准备等情况。通过检查，干部、群众对搞好防汛、防洪工作的认识有了很大的提高，对不合标准的工程立即进行了补修。郴州专区的防汛、防洪大检查已反复进行四、五次，对三百多处有问题的水库都作了处理，开好了溢洪道，加固了大坝，巩固了水利运动的成果。隆回县为了防止山洪冲垮水库和塘坝，开辟了围山大圳十三万条。长沙县还抓住目前大洪峰来到前的有利时机，在所有的大堤上，加筑了一米高的子堤。一般堤段，都准备了导滤沟。同时还将水库的防汛任务落实到人，签订了合同，建立了卡片。结合5月中的防汛抢险，各公社都进行了防汛演习。
    各地对防洪器材也准备好了。洞口县十六个大、中型水库就准备了防洪的木材八百六十八立方米，太平土一万二千余方，柴草四千五百余捆。各地根据以土为主，土洋结合，就地取材，自力更生的原则，大力自筹器材。湖区各地对原有的防汛器材进行了清理，并新筹集砂卵石十三万方，草袋五十七万个，芦柴一千七百八十五万捆。山区丘陵区的水库工程，也筹集了大批木材、砂卵石、草袋等。
