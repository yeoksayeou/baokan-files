    How to Identify Wild Fibers?
    To identify seed fiber plants, first hold the fiber from the seed between your left thumb and forefinger, then use the thumb and forefinger of your right hand to smooth the fiber and observe the length of the individual fibers. Generally, if the length is over two centimeters and it makes a slight sound when broken, it can be used for industrial textiles. If the fiber length is between one and two centimeters, it can be used for home spinning. If it is less than one centimeter and the content is high, it can be used to make rayon.
    To identify stem fiber plants, first peel off the raw bark, hold it between your thumb and forefinger of both hands, and use your thumbnail to scrape off the epidermis. Then gently rub it with the thumb and forefinger of both hands. The scraping and rubbing should be done continuously several times, preferably with a little water, so that the fiber part is exposed. Then you can hold a small amount of fiber and pull it outward with force. At this time, if slender fibers can be separated out, you can observe the thickness of the separated fibers. Generally, the thinner the better. Further, use the thumb and forefinger of both hands to break the fiber. If there is a sound when breaking it, it indicates that this fiber can be used. If slender fibers cannot be pulled out, you can gently pull it horizontally. If you can see a net-like, fine fiber, it indicates that the fiber is short and suitable for spinning linen fabrics. If you see the fiber in thin sheets, it can be used for making ropes. Various grass fibers can be identified using this method.

    怎样鉴定野生纤维？
    鉴定种子纤维类植物，应先将种子上的纤维，用左手大拇指及食指夹住，然后用右手的拇食指将纤维理平，观察单纤维的长度。一般长度在两厘米以上，拉断时有微细的声音者，可供工业纺织用；如纤维长度在一至二厘米之间，可供土纺使用；在一厘米以下，含量较高的，可供制人造丝用。
    鉴定茎纤维类植物，应先将生皮剥下，用两手拇食指夹住，以拇指甲刮去表皮，再用两手的拇食指轻轻搓动。在刮皮和搓动时，应连续进行数次，最好能加点水，这样纤维部分就暴露出来。然后可用手夹住少量纤维，用力向外拉。这时，如能有细长纤维分离出来，就可观察分出来的纤维的粗细情况。一般以细的为好。进一步用两手拇食指将纤维拉断，如拉断时有声响，说明这种纤维可以利用；如拉不出细长纤维，可以轻轻横拉，如能看到网状较细的纤维，说明纤维较短，适用于纺麻布织物；如看到成细片状的纤维，则可供制麻索用。各种草类纤维，均可用这种方法鉴定。
