    Mobilizing the Masses Yields Solutions

    Summer has arrived, and many factories and enterprises are actively taking measures to improve heatstroke prevention and cooling. However, some factories emphasize a lack of cooling equipment and have not actively taken steps to improve cooling efforts. In fact, as long as the leadership attaches importance to this, and mobilizes the masses to rely on their own efforts and use indigenous methods, even without ready-made mechanical equipment, heatstroke prevention and cooling work can still be done well. Take our glass factory as an example. The temperature in the factory workshops is generally around 40 degrees Celsius, and the factory buildings are old-style civilian houses that have been renovated, so natural ventilation is very poor; there are also very few fans and bellows. However, because our factory leaders attach importance to this and integrate heatstroke prevention and cooling work with the "four modernizations" movement, mobilizing the masses to come up with solutions, we have solved the problem without purchasing any mechanical equipment. For example, the water-pressure sprayers made by the workers from old waste materials in two days and nights cost only a few cents each, but are very effective and can also save electricity; installing six to eight water-pressure sprayers in a high-temperature workshop can replace electric sprayers worth more than 400 yuan. We also built a tunnel annealing kiln in the third workshop. With it, workers no longer have to operate in a furnace room with a temperature of 70 degrees Celsius. Because the heatstroke prevention and cooling work has been done well, the health and safety of employees have been ensured, and labor productivity has been greatly improved.

    发动群众就有办法
    夏季到了，不少工厂企业都积极地采取措施搞好防暑降温工作。但是，也有的厂强调缺乏降温机械设备，没有积极主动的去搞好降温工作。其实，只要领导重视，发动群众自力更生，土法上马，没有现成的机械设备，防暑降温工作是一样可以搞好的。就拿我们玻璃厂来说吧，厂内车间的温度一般都在摄氏四十度左右，而厂房又是旧式民房改建的，自然通风条件很差；风扇、风鼓也很少。但是由于我们厂领导重视，把防暑降温工作与“四化”运动结合起来，发动群众想办法，结果没有购置什么机械设备，也解决了问题。如职工们奋战两昼夜，利用旧废料制成的水压喷雾器，一个只花几分钱，收效大，而且还能节约用电；在高温车间安装了六至八个水压喷雾器，就能代替价值四百多元的电动喷雾器。我们还在第三车间搞了一条隧道退火窑。有了它，工人就不用再在摄氏七十度的炉房里操作了。由于防暑降温工作做得好，职工的健康与安全有了保障，劳动生产率大大提高。
