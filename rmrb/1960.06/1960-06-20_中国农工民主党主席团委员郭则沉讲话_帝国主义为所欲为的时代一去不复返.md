Xinhua News Agency, June 19th: Guo Zecheng, member of the Presidium of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, said at a rally of democratic parties and non-party democrats against U.S. imperialist aggression on the 18th that the notorious warmonger Eisenhower, disregarding the strong opposition of the people of Asian countries, insisted on going to the Philippines, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan for a "visit" to plot new wars. This is a new step by U.S. imperialism in escalating the situation in Asia. Undoubtedly, it will bring new threats to the people of Asia.

He said that not long ago, U.S. imperialism sabotaged the Four-Power Summit Conference, and its aggressive nature was further exposed to peace-loving people all over the world, thus falling into a more isolated situation. The struggles of the people of Japan, South Korea, Turkey and other countries against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs are rising. The puppets of the United States in these regions have either been overthrown or are teetering. Now, the head of U.S. imperialism, Eisenhower, has to take the risk and personally come to Asia to cheer up his servants, vainly attempting to suppress the patriotic and just struggles of the people of Asian countries, which has aroused strong opposition from the people of Asian countries.

Guo Zecheng said that Eisenhower was originally scheduled to arrive in Japan on the 19th for a "visit," but under the pressure of the massive struggle of the Japanese people, Eisenhower was forced to change his plan to insist on "visiting" Japan. The failure of his "visit" plan convincingly shows that no matter how stubborn and rampant imperialism and reactionaries are, as long as the people unite and carry out resolute struggles, they can defeat all their conspiracies.

Guo Zecheng said that in the raging fire of opposition to U.S. imperialism that has spread across Asia, Eisenhower went to Taiwan, our country's territory, on the 18th for a "visit." Obviously, this was with ulterior motives to create a "two Chinas" conspiracy. The heinous purpose of creating the so-called "two Chinas" is to permanently turn Taiwan into a U.S. colony, create a threat to mainland China, and facilitate maintaining and creating tension in the Far East to launch new wars. Such an aggressive policy that is resolutely hostile to us is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. We must warn Eisenhower that the era of letting imperialism do whatever it wants is long gone. Powerful socialist China has enough power to crush any aggression, and every provocation against us will be met with a doubled counterattack. Taiwan is an inseparable part of our sacred territory. No matter what tricks Eisenhower plays in Taiwan, he will never be able to stop the Chinese people's firm determination to liberate Taiwan.

Guo Zecheng finally said that the Fujian Front Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army issued a letter to the military and civilians in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu on June 17th. In order to support the just struggle of the people of Asian countries against Eisenhower's bandit trip, to support the just struggle of the patriotic compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu against Eisenhower's bandit trip, and to express the great Chinese people's contempt and disdain for Eisenhower, it was decided to hold an anti-American armed demonstration on the Kinmen front and fire cannons to "welcome" him. All members of our Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party express our warm support, vowing to join the people of the whole country in carrying out a resolute struggle against the U.S. imperialists. He indignantly shouted: Plague god Eisenhower, get out!

### 中国农工民主党主席团委员郭则沉讲话  帝国主义为所欲为的时代一去不复返

    中国农工民主党主席团委员郭则沉讲话
    帝国主义为所欲为的时代一去不复返
    新华社19日讯　中国农工民主党主席团委员郭则沉18日在各民主党派和无党派民主人士反对美帝侵略的抗议集会上说，臭名昭彰的战争贩子艾森豪威尔不顾亚洲各国人民的强烈反对，竟硬着头皮要到菲律宾、日本、南朝鲜、台湾进行“访问”，策划新战争，这正是美帝国主义加剧亚洲局势的一个新步骤。毫无疑问，它将给亚洲人民带来新的威胁。
    他说，不久以前，美帝国主义破坏了四国首脑会议，它的侵略本性在全世界爱好和平人民面前更加暴露无遗，因而陷于更加孤立的境地：日本、南朝鲜、土耳其等各国人民，反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争日益高涨，美国在这些地区的傀儡有的已被推翻，有的正在摇摇欲坠。现在，美帝国主义的头子艾森豪威尔不得不甘冒风险，亲自出马，到亚洲来给他的一些奴仆打气撑腰，妄想压制亚洲各国人民的爱国正义斗争，已经激起了亚洲各国人民的强烈反对。
    郭则沉说，艾森豪威尔原定在19日到达日本“访问”，但在日本人民声势浩大的斗争的压力下，艾森豪威尔被迫改变了他坚持“访问”日本的计划。他的这个“访问”计划的失败，令人信服地表明，不论帝国主义和反动派如何顽固和猖狂，只要人民团结起来进行坚决的斗争，就能够击败它的一切阴谋计划。
    郭则沉说，在亚洲燃遍了反对美帝国主义的烈火中，艾森豪威尔在18日到我国的领土台湾去进行“访问”，显然，这是心怀鬼胎地为制造“两个中国”的阴谋而去的。制造所谓“两个中国”的罪恶目的，就是企图把台湾永久变为美国的殖民地，造成对中国大陆的威胁，并便于保持和制造远东紧张局势发动新战争。这种坚决与我为敌的侵略政策，断然不是我国人民所能容忍的。我们必须警告艾森豪威尔，听任帝国主义为所欲为的时代早已一去不复返了。强大的社会主义的中国，有足够粉碎任何侵略的力量，你们对我们每一次的挑衅，都一定要受到加倍的回击。台湾是我国神圣领土的一部分，不论艾森豪威尔到台湾耍什么花招，都决不能阻碍我国人民一定要解放台湾的坚强意志。
    郭则沉最后说，中国人民解放军福建前线司令部于6月17日发表告台、澎、金、马军民同胞书，为了支持亚洲各国人民反对艾森豪威尔强盗旅行的正义斗争，为了支持台、澎、金、马爱国同胞反对艾森豪威尔强盗旅行的正义斗争，为了表示伟大的中国人民对艾森豪威尔的蔑视和鄙视，决定在金门前线举行反美武装示威，打炮“迎送”，我们农工民主党全体成员表示热烈的拥护，誓与全国人民一道，同美帝国主义者进行坚决的斗争。他激愤地高呼：瘟神艾森豪威尔滚回去！
