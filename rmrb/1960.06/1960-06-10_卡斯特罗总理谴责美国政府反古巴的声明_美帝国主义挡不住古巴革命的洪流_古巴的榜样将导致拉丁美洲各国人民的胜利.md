Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 8th - Prime Minister Castro this morning categorically rejected the anti-Cuban statement issued by the U.S. government on the 4th, and emphasized that the Cuban revolution can never be changed, contained, or defeated by the pressure, economic or military aggression of U.S. imperialism.
	
	Prime Minister Castro made these remarks at the closing session of the National Congress of the Barbers' Union held at the Workers' Palace here.

	Castro emphasized that despite the obstruction and growing hostility of that "powerful neighbor," the Cuban revolution is becoming stronger and more advanced, and will continue to move forward.

	Castro warned that the enemies will never let Cuba have peace; their aggression against Cuba will increase, and they will implement plans for economic aggression and even armed aggression. However, Castro emphasized, "If they attempt to invade and violate us, they will be defeated." He said, "The Pentagon strategists have forgotten that there is no greater force than love for one's country." He said that love for one's country is a force that can generate "power greater than that of uranium and hydrogen." Cuba's future is more reliable than ever before, "because we have become masters of everything we have, and we do what we deem appropriate with everything we have."

	Castro also condemned the anti-Cuban conspiracies being promoted by the United States abroad. He said that imperialism is engaging in activities against the Trujillo dictatorship in the Organization of American States. He pointed out that the Trujillo dictatorship was a product of the U.S. military occupation of the Dominican Republic, and it has always been supported by the U.S. government. The purpose of the United States in opposing Trujillo is only to create a precedent for intervention, and then use this means to deal with Cuba.

	Castro emphasized the great achievements of President Dorticos' trip to South America. He said that this shows that the attempt to isolate the Cuban revolution among the people of Latin American countries has failed.

	Castro said that the people of Latin America "are watching Cuba with hope, and they have no hesitation in recognizing that Cuba is an example, and their victory depends on the victory of Cuba." Castro emphasized, "This is the role we are playing in the first trench in Latin America," "This trench can never be taken by the enemy." He emphasized that Cuba's example "will lead to the victory of the people of Latin American countries."

	Castro concluded by emphasizing that the slogan of the Cuban people is: "We will win!"

    卡斯特罗总理谴责美国政府反古巴的声明
    美帝国主义挡不住古巴革命的洪流
    古巴的榜样将导致拉丁美洲各国人民的胜利
    新华社哈瓦那8日电　卡斯特罗总理今天早晨断然拒绝美国政府4日发表的反古巴的声明，并且强调说，古巴革命决不可能由于美帝国主义的压力、经济或军事侵略而改变方向、或者被遏止住、被击败。
    卡斯特罗总理的这番话是在理发师联合会在这里的工人宫举行的全国代表大会的闭幕会上讲的。
    卡斯特罗强调指出，古巴尽管受到那个“强大的邻国”的阻挠和日益增长的敌视，但是古巴的革命却越来越强大和先进，并将继续前进。
    卡斯特罗警告说，敌人决不会使古巴安宁下来，他们对古巴的侵略性将日益增长，他们将推行经济侵略甚至武装侵略计划。但是，卡斯特罗强调说，“如果他们企图侵略和侵犯我们，他们将被击败。”他说，“五角大楼的战略家们忘记了，没有比对祖国的热爱更大的力量了”。他说，对祖国的热爱是一种能产生“比铀和氢的威力更大的”力量。古巴的前途比以往任何时候都更可靠了，“因为我们成了我们的一切的主人，我们靠我们的一切来做我们认为适当的事情。”
    卡斯特罗还谴责了美国在国外推行的反古巴的阴谋。他说，帝国主义正在美洲国家组织中搞反对特鲁希略独裁者的活动。他指出，特鲁希略独裁者是美国在多米尼加的军事占领的产物，他从来就是得到美国政府的支持的。美国搞反对特鲁希略的目的，只是为了制造干涉的先例，然后再用这一手段来对付古巴。
    卡斯特罗强调指出了多尔蒂科斯总统南美之行所获得的极大的成就。他说，这表明，使古巴革命在拉丁美洲各国人民中孤立起来的企图失败了。
    卡斯特罗说，拉丁美洲人民“充满了希望地注视着古巴，他们毫不迟疑地认定，古巴是榜样，他们的胜利取决于古巴的胜利。”卡斯特罗强调指出，“这就是我们正在拉丁美洲的第一条战壕中所起的作用”，“这条战壕是永远也不可能让敌人拿下的”。他强调说，古巴的榜样“将导致拉丁美洲各国人民的胜利”。
    卡斯特罗最后着重指出，古巴人民的口号是：“我们必胜！”
