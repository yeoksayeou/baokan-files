    Secretary Wang in the Summer Harvest
    On May 28th, our Sangudong Brigade's summer harvest began. After the telephone conference, Zhang Baozhuo and Aunt Li, from the wheat harvesting team, had just arrived at the edge of the field when they looked up and saw Wang Yongfa, the brigade's Party Branch Secretary, already cutting wheat with a sickle. Aunt Li was stunned and asked, "Lao Wang! I just heard you speaking at the telephone conference, how did you start cutting wheat so quickly?" Secretary Wang smiled and said, "To rush the harvest and threshing, we must race against time." As he spoke, he continued to cut, always ahead of the others. The commune members couldn't catch up with him. In the afternoon, when transporting the wheat, Wang Yongfa worked even harder, carrying load after load to the threshing ground, until all the wheat was transported. Only then did he knock off work with the commune members.

    王书记在夏收中
    5月28日，我们三古垌大队夏收开始了。开完电话会议以后，张保琢和李大娘这个收麦小组，刚走到地边，抬头一看，大队总支书记王永法正在拿着镰刀割麦，李大娘愣住了，问道：“老王！刚才还听你在电话会议上讲话，怎么一转眼又割起麦来了？”王书记笑着说：“要抢收抢打，就得分秒必争。”他边说边割，总是割在别人前边。社员们怎么也追不上他。下午运麦的时候，王永法干的更欢，一担接着一担往场院担运，一直把麦子全部担完，才和社员们一起收工。
