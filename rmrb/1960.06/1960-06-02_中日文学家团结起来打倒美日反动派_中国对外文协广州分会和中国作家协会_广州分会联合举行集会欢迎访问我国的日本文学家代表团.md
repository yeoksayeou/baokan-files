Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 1st. The Guangzhou Branch of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the Guangzhou Branch of the Chinese Writers Association, jointly held a gathering this afternoon to welcome the Japanese literary delegation led by Hiroshi Noma, which was invited to visit China. At the meeting, Chinese and Japanese literary figures severely condemned Nobusuke Kishi, the running dog of US imperialism, for using force to illegally and forcibly "pass" the aggressive US-Japan military alliance treaty in the Japanese House of Representatives, and unanimously demanded that US imperialism get back to its old home.

    This seven-member delegation was invited by the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries to visit China and arrived in Guangzhou yesterday.

    More than 1,000 people from Guangzhou's cultural and artistic circles attended today's welcoming meeting.

    Du Guoxiang, president of the Guangzhou Branch of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, delivered a welcoming speech at the meeting. He first expressed a warm welcome to the Japanese literary delegation for making great contributions to the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle. Du Guoxiang pointed out that the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle has carried out sixteen magnificent unified actions, and an even larger seventeenth unified action is underway. The Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle is closely linked with the struggle against US imperialism, which is very correct. Because US imperialism is our most ferocious enemy. Du Guoxiang emphasized that the Japanese people's struggle is by no means isolated, and 650 million Chinese people resolutely support the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle.

    Hiroshi Noma, the head of the Japanese literary delegation, spoke amidst the enthusiastic slogans and warm applause of the masses. He vividly described the heroic deeds of the Japanese people in the patriotic and just struggle against the US-Japan military alliance treaty. He said that the Japanese people clearly see that the new "security treaty" regards the Soviet Union, China, and Asian countries as hypothetical enemies. When the delegation left Japan, the people's struggle had become an unstoppable force. We have the confidence and determination to fight to the final victory. Because the Japanese people deeply understand the importance of peace, democracy, and independence. Today's struggle has expanded to every corner of the country and is becoming stronger and stronger.

    Hiroshi Noma then pointed out that Syngman Rhee, the running dog of US imperialism in South Korea, and Adnan Menderes, the running dog in Turkey, were both driven away in the struggles of the South Korean and Turkish people, and the next to be overthrown will undoubtedly be Nobusuke Kishi. He finally said that while thanking the Chinese people for their great support for the Japanese people's struggle, the Japanese literary delegation will convey the fighting spirit of the Japanese people to the Chinese people, hoping to get greater support through this visit.

    Yoko Matsuoka, a famous Japanese female critic, also spoke at the meeting.

    The masses who participated in today's conference were in high spirits, and they kept shouting "US imperialism, get back to your old home!"

    "The people of China and Japan unite to overthrow US imperialism!" and other slogans.

    The delegation will go to Beijing on the 2nd.

    中日文学家团结起来打倒美日反动派
    中国对外文协广州分会和中国作家协会
    广州分会联合举行集会欢迎访问我国的日本文学家代表团
    新华社广州1日电　中国人民对外文化协会广州分会和中国作家协会广州分会，今天下午联合举行集会，欢迎应邀来我国访问的由野间宏率领的日本文学家代表团。中、日两国的文学家在会上严厉斥责美帝国主义的走狗岸信介用武力迫使日本众议院非法强行“通过”侵略性的日美军事同盟条约，一致要求美帝国主义滚回老家去。
    这个一行七人的代表团是应中国人民对外文化协会邀请来我国访问，在昨天到达广州的。
    参加今天欢迎会的有广州文化艺术界人士一千多人。
    中国人民对外文化协会广州分会会长杜国庠在会上致欢迎词，他首先对在这次日本人民的爱国正义斗争中作出了巨大贡献的日本文学家代表团表示热烈欢迎。杜国庠指出：日本人民的爱国正义斗争已经进行了十六次气势磅礴的统一行动，规模更大的十七次统一行动正在进行。日本人民的爱国正义斗争和反对美帝国主义的斗争紧密地连接在一起，这是十分正确的。因为美帝国主义是我们的最凶恶的敌人。杜国庠强调说：日本人民的斗争绝不是孤立的，六亿五千万中国人民坚决支持日本人民的爱国正义斗争。
    日本文学家代表团团长野间宏在群众激昂的口号和热烈掌声中讲话。他生动地叙述了日本人民在反对日美军事同盟条约的爱国正义斗争中的英勇事迹。他说，日本人民很清楚地看到，新“安全条约”就是把苏联、中国、亚洲各国作为假定的敌国来看待的，代表团离开日本的时候，人民的斗争已经愈来愈成为不可阻挡的力量。我们有信心、有决心斗争到最后胜利。因为日本人民从心里体会到和平、民主、和独立的重要性。今天的斗争已扩大到全国各个角落，并且愈来愈坚强壮大。
    野间宏接着指出，美帝国主义在南朝鲜的走狗李承晚和在土耳其的走狗曼德列斯都在南朝鲜和土耳其人民的斗争中被赶走了，下一个被打倒的不用说就是岸信介。他最后说，日本文学家代表团在感谢中国人民对日本人民的斗争给予极大支持的同时，要将日本人民意志昂扬的斗争面貌传达给中国人民，希望通过这次访问，得到更大的支持。
    日本著名女评论家松冈洋子也在会上讲了话。
    参加今天大会的群众情绪昂扬，他们不断高呼“美帝国主义滚回老家去！”
    “中日两国人民团结起来，打倒美帝国主义！”等口号。
    代表团将于2日前往北京。
