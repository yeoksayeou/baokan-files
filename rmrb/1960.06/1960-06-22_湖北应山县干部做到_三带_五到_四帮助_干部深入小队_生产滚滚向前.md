Hubei Province, Ying Shan County, Cadres Achieve "Three Carries," "Five Arrivals," and "Four Helps":
Cadres Go Deep into Production Teams, Production Rolls Forward

(Our Dispatch) Since May, Ying Shan County, Hubei Province, cadres at all levels have gone deep into production teams to participate in production and assist in work. This has greatly improved the political thinking and leadership abilities of team cadres, inspired the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses, and promoted the summer harvesting and planting production movement to advance wave after wave.

Since May, the county party committee has organized more than 3,500 cadres from agriculture, government offices, finance and trade, culture and education, and other fronts to go deep into 3,400 production teams and some pig farms and other grassroots units throughout the county to work. The fourteen county-level cadres, 590 county-level office cadres, and more than 2,000 cadres above the production team level, according to the requirements of the county party committee, have achieved "Three Carries" (carrying luggage, tools, and labor record books), "Five Arrivals" (arriving at the most difficult places, the most backward teams, the fields, the canteens, and the pig farms), and "Four Helps" (helping team cadres improve their political and ideological level, plan production, arrange life, and follow the mass line). As a result, the relationship between cadres and the masses has been further strengthened, and summer harvesting and planting have been carried out well.

Because cadres went deep into production units, problems were discovered in a timely manner and solved quickly. When Comrade Yang Xiangming, the first secretary of the county party committee, went deep into the 12th team of the Tuozi Management Area of Guangshui Commune to participate in production with the masses, he used his rest time to make close friends with poor peasants. In in-depth conversations, he found that some cadres and commune members had the idea of ​​neglecting cotton production. At the same time, he also found that some cotton fields had serious problems of missing seedlings, fertilizer deficiency, and weed overgrowth. Therefore, on the one hand, he helped the team cadres improve their ideological understanding and mobilized the masses to rush to plant and manage; on the other hand, he immediately convened a telephone conference of the commune party committee secretaries to criticize the idea of ​​underestimating cotton production and put forward specific requirements for planting cotton. In this way, in just five days, the entire commune rushed to plant and transplant more than 8,000 mu of cotton and carried out thinning, weeding, pest control, and topdressing on the more than 30,000 mu of cotton that had already been planted.

For teams with backward work, the communes have specially sent capable cadres to provide specific assistance. The leading cadres of Guangshui Commune conducted specific analysis and research on the 174 backward teams in the whole commune, and formulated a "Five Catch-Up" plan for backward teams to catch up with advanced teams, low-yield to catch up with high-yield, poor teams to catch up with rich teams, mountain areas to catch up with plains, and miscellaneous grains to catch up with staple grains. They also sent nine party committee members and more than 350 cadres above the team level to these areas to strengthen leadership, so that the appearance of these areas changed rapidly. Now 80% of these backward teams have caught up with the advanced teams. In the "Double Rush" campaign, these teams not only made rapid progress, but also reached the level of advanced teams in terms of production quality.

Because the broad masses of cadres carried forward the fine style of hard struggle and taking the lead in everything in the teams, many difficult problems were readily solved. The sixth team of the Ma'an Management Area of Yudidian Commune had no water source for transplanting mid-season rice. Fu Zhongwang, the secretary of the general branch, mobilized the masses and personally led more than 60 commune members to surround the mountain and open a canal. After two days of hard work, they erected a bridge and turned the water from the reservoir over the mountains to irrigate the fields, rushing to plant more than 100 mu of mid-season rice. The commune members praised: "When the secretary comes, the difficulties are gone, the thinking is clear, and the water is also there."

    湖北应山县干部做到“三带”“五到”“四帮助”
    干部深入小队  生产滚滚向前
    本报讯　湖北省应山县各级干部深入到生产小队参加生产，帮助工作，大大提高了小队干部的政治思想和领导能力，鼓舞了广大群众的劳动热情，推动了夏收夏种生产运动一浪高一浪的向前发展。
    5月份以来，县委组织了农业、机关、财贸、文教等战线的干部三千五百多名，深入到全县三千四百个生产小队和一部分养猪场等基层单位工作。下去的十四个县级干部、五百九十个县级机关干部和二千多个生产队以上干部，都根据县委的要求，做到了“三带”（带行李、工具、劳动手册），“五到”（到最困难的地方、到最落后的小队、到田间、到食堂、到养猪场），“四帮助”（帮助小队干部提高政策思想水平、计划生产、安排生活、走群众路线），因而进一步密切了干群关系，搞好了夏收夏种。
    由于干部深入生产单位，因而做到了发现问题及时，解决问题迅速。县委第一书记杨向明同志，深入广水公社驼子管理区十二队跟群众一道参加生产的时候，利用休息时间跟贫农交知心朋友。在深入交谈中，他发现有些干部和社员有忽视棉花生产的思想，同时还发现有一部分棉田有严重缺苗、脱肥，草荒现象。于是，他一方面帮助这个队干部提高思想认识，发动群众突击抢种和管理；另一方面，立即召开了公社党委书记电话会议，批判了轻视棉花生产的思想，并提出了播种棉花的具体要求。这样，只用了五天的时间，全公社就抢种、抢栽了棉花八千多亩，并对已种的三万多亩棉田进行了间苗、锄草、除虫和追肥。
    对工作后进的队，各公社特别加派了得力干部去具体帮助。广水公社领导干部对全社一百七十四个落后小队进行了具体分析研究，订出了后进赶先进、低产赶高产、穷队赶富队、山岗赶平原、杂粮赶主粮的“五赶”计划，并派出九名党委委员和三百五十多名队以上干部到这些地区加强领导，使这些地区面貌迅速改变。现在这些后进队已有80％赶上了先进队。在“双抢”运动中，这些队不仅进度快，生产质量也赶上了先进队的水平。
    由于广大干部在小队里发扬了艰苦奋斗、事事带头的优良作风，许多困难问题都迎刃而解。余店公社马鞍管理区第六队插中稻没有水源，总支书记傅仲望就发动群众，亲自带领六十多个社员，围山开渠。经过两天奋战，架起了天桥，把水库里的水翻过山岭灌到田里，抢栽了中稻一百多亩。社员赞扬说：“书记来了，困难走了，思想通了，水也有了。”
