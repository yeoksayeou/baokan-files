Xinhua News Agency, June 27th, Buenos Aires Dispatch: Nearly 300,000 construction workers in Argentina announced a 24-hour general strike on the 22nd, demanding higher wages and the conclusion of new collective contracts with employers.

The strikers pointed out that employers had refused to raise wages for seventeen months, even though domestic prices had risen by 130% during this period.

Xinhua News Agency, June 26th, Buenos Aires Dispatch: The plenary session of the Trade Union Solidarity and Cooperation Movement, which ended this morning, called on the Argentine working class to unite against the plans of the International Monetary Fund and against the repressive actions taken to ensure the implementation of this plan.

Representatives from 180 national trade unions, 15 local general trade unions, and major industrial enterprises attended the meeting. The fact that representatives of many agricultural workers' unions also attended this meeting was considered to be of particular importance.

The meeting unanimously adopted a report condemning the International Monetary Fund's plan, which has led to a sharp decline in the living standards of workers and the general population. The report emphasized that the working class must unite to fight against the colonial policies of U.S. imperialism and the threat of nuclear war. The report also pointed out the great victories achieved by people of all countries in their struggle against imperialism and for liberation from colonialism.

The meeting adopted a five-point action plan for the solidarity and unified leadership of the labor movement. These plans included immediate action to demand increased wages, oppose high living costs, demand the release of imprisoned political prisoners and workers, oppose torture, demand an end to martial law, cancel the Conintes Plan declaring a state of emergency in the country, reject the "Federal Emergency Law Against Terrorism," and oppose state interference in trade unions.
