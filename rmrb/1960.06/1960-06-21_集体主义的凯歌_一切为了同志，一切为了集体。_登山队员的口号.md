    A Triumphant Song of Collectivism
    "Everything for the Comrades, Everything for the Collective."
    -- Mountaineers' Slogan

In a foreign mountaineering adventure book, there is a record of a statement made by the British "explorer" Eric Shipton, who climbed Mount Everest twice:

Only a saint would not harbor such a wish: hoping that his companion would fall ill so that he could replace him and enjoy the honor of reaching the summit alone.

This is such a typical example of the selfish idea of harming others to benefit oneself in a capitalist social system.

Completely contrary to their despicable ideas, in the face of danger and difficulty, the slogan of our mountaineers is: "Give the last sip of water to the collective, use the left hand to help comrades if the right hand is broken!"

Recently, throughout the entire battle of our mountaineering team conquering Mount Everest, our mountaineers composed a moving triumphant song of collectivism with this communist spirit of self-sacrifice and altruism.

Although only three people reached the summit this time, their success was precisely due to relying on the strength of the collective. All two hundred and fourteen members of the mountaineering team were victors in conquering Mount Everest, and they all contributed indispensable strength to this glorious victory.

When the third acclimatization march to conquer Mount Everest began, the mountaineers braved the severe cold of minus 30 degrees Celsius and climbed the snow slopes above 7,600 meters above sea level. Because it was the first time ascending to such a height, the thin air made everyone dizzy, their chests constricted, and their physical strength greatly weakened. The mountaineering team headquarters immediately ordered that intermittent inhalation of artificial oxygen should begin from here. The team members put on oxygen masks one by one and turned on the oxygen cylinder switch. A warm current flowed through their bodies, making them feel light all over. However, team leader Shi Zhanchun was still breathing heavily and walking with difficulty. Although he also put on an oxygen mask and turned on the oxygen cylinder switch, he had not been able to inhale a single breath of oxygen for a long time. Upon careful inspection, it turned out that the intake port of the oxygen mask was frozen, and the ice blocked the flow of oxygen. It was very difficult to remove the ice in such a low-temperature environment. At this time, Liu Lianman, a firefighter from Harbin, took off his own oxygen mask and put it on Shi Zhanchun's face without hesitation. Shi Zhanchun shook his head gratefully and took it off to return it to Liu Lianman. However, Liu Lianman resolutely refused to accept it and insisted on putting it on Shi Zhanchun. He said: "You are the team leader, you have to command the mountaineering activities of the entire team. Not only for your personal sake, but more importantly for our entire collective. You must wear it!" Leaving the difficulties and dangers to themselves and giving safety and convenience to others, our mountaineers are such people with communist style.

Once, the team departed from the camp at 7,800 meters above sea level along an extremely steep mountain ridge, treading on snow and climbing ice to reach a place 8,100 meters above sea level. It was already a pitch-black night. Because the transport team was blocked by wind and snow and did not keep up, the team members had no food or fuel in their backpacks, and they were about to suffer from hunger and cold. At this time, Tibetan team members Laba Cairin and Tibetan team member Mima, who were already sore and tired after marching for more than ten hours, did not hesitate to risk falling off the cliff and returned to the camp at 7,600 meters above sea level overnight to find a solution. Later, when the reporter asked them: What power prompted you to do this? These two children born in Tibetan serf families smiled and asked in return: "For the happiness of us Tibetans, many Han workers and People's Liberation Army soldiers shed blood and sweat, and even contributed their lives. What do you say prompted them to do this?"

Mountaineering team members will never forget the contributions made by the meteorological staff in the victory of climbing Mount Everest this time. The meteorological staff used their ordinary labor to accurately calculate that the Mount Everest area would have first-class good weather from May 19 to May 25, thus enabling the mountaineering team to grasp the most favorable opportunity and launch a timely assault before the bad weather arrived, reaching the summit.

Once, the team was preparing to depart from the No. 3 camp at 6,400 meters above sea level on Mount Everest and climb to an area above 7,000 meters above sea level. The meteorological staff at the base camp suddenly received weather information: There would be heavy wind and snow above 7,000 meters above sea level. In order not to let the comrades on the mountain be attacked by the wind and snow, Wei Guangfu and Tan Keyuan, staff members of the base camp, braved the wind and snow to go to the camp at 6,400 meters above sea level to deliver letters to the team. The altitude increase from the base camp to the camp at 6,400 meters above sea level is nearly 1,300 meters, and they had to constantly pass through rugged rocks and dangerous ice plains. In the mountaineers' planned march, it originally took three days to walk. However, for the safety of their comrades, Wei Guangfu and Tan Keyuan insisted on marching for more than twenty hours and finally arrived at the place where the team was staying late that night, delivering the weather forecast to their comrades. At that time, they hardly had the strength to speak, but a victorious smile appeared on their lips.

In order to reduce the physical exertion of the team members assaulting the summit and ensure the victory of the entire mountaineering team, the transport team members put the heavy burden on their shoulders; in order to allow the team members assaulting the summit to get more artificial oxygen, the transport team members rarely or even did not use artificial oxygen, saving oxygen even in oxygen-deficient areas above 8,000 meters above sea level, carrying more than 30 kilograms of things on their backs.

In the mountaineering team, such "unsung heroes" are so worthy of our eternal praise and eternal learning! Doctor Wu Yongsheng himself was in poor health, but in order to ensure the health of his comrades, he braved the harsh climate and traversed the dangerous terrain to reach areas above 7,000 meters above sea level with the mountaineering team; the general affairs personnel of the mountaineering team were busy everywhere, transporting a large number of various materials and equipment from all over the motherland. They were the first to arrive in the mountainous area and the last to leave the mountainous area; the radio operators kept the mountaineering team in close contact with relevant departments all over the country day and night; the cooks made delicious meals for the mountaineers every day....

Yes, our mountaineers are fighting for the collective cause in this way. As a mountaineer wrote in his diary: "The collective is my mother, and I am the son of the collective. Without the collective, there would be no me. I want to unconditionally contribute my life and blood to the collective, so that the insignificant individual can emit light and heat in the great collective."

### 集体主义的凯歌  “一切为了同志，一切为了集体。”——登山队员的口号

    集体主义的凯歌
    “一切为了同志，一切为了集体。”
    ——登山队员的口号
    新华社记者　郭超人
    在一本外国登山探险的书籍中，记载着曾经两次攀登珠穆朗玛峰的英国“探险家”埃里克·希普敦讲过的一句话：
    只有圣人才不怀有这样的愿望：盼望他的同伴病倒而让自己取而代之，独享登上顶峰的荣誉。
    这是多么典型的资本主义社会制度下人与人之间的损人利己的思想。
    与他们这种卑鄙的想法完全相反，在危险和困难的面前，我国登山队员们的口号是：“把最后一口水让给集体，右手坏了用左手帮助同志！”
    最近，在我国登山队征服珠穆朗玛峰的整个战斗中，我国登山队员们就以这种自我牺牲和舍己为人的共产主义精神，谱成了一曲动人心弦的集体主义凯歌。
    这次登上顶峰的虽然只有三个人，但他们的成功正是由于依靠了集体的力量。登山队全部二百一十四个成员，每个人都是征服珠穆朗玛峰的胜利者，他们都为这个辉煌的胜利贡献了不可缺少的力量。
    当征服珠穆朗玛峰的第三次适应性行军开始以后，登山队员们冒着摄氏零下三十几度的严寒，登上了拔海七千六百米以上的雪坡。因为是第一次上升到这样的高度，稀薄的氧气使大家头昏眼花，胸脯梗塞，体力大大衰弱。登山队队部当即命令，从这里开始进行断续性的吸人造氧气。队员们一个个戴上了氧气面罩，扭开了氧气筒的开关，一股暖流流过了他们的全身，使他们顿时感到轻快起来。但是，队长史占春却仍然在沉重地喘着气，艰难地行走着。他虽然也戴上了氧气面罩，打开了氧气筒的开关，但是很长时间过去了，他却没有能够吸进一口氧气。仔细检查，原来是氧气面罩的吸气口结冰，冰块堵住了氧气的流通。想取掉冰块，在那种低气温的情况下是很困难的。这时，来自哈尔滨的消防员刘连满丝毫没有犹豫，就把自己脸上的氧气面罩取下戴到史占春的脸上。史占春感激地摇了摇头，又取下来还给刘连满。但刘连满坚决不肯接受，又硬给史占春戴上了。他说：“你是队长，你要指挥全大队的登山活动。不仅仅为了你个人，更重要的是为了我们整个的集体。你一定要戴上它！”把艰难和危险留给自己，把安全和方便让给别人，我国的登山队员就是这样具有共产主义风格的人。
    有一次，大队沿着极端险峻的山岭，从拔海七千八百米的营地出发，踏雪蹬冰登上了拔海八千一百米的地方，当时已是漆黑的夜晚。由于运输队员被风雪所阻，没有跟上，队员们的背包里没有食物，没有燃料，眼看就要遭到饥寒交迫的煎熬。而这时，经过十几个小时行军已经腰酸背痛的藏族队员拉八才仁和藏族队员米马，却毫不迟疑地冒着坠岩的危险，连夜返回拔海七千六百米的营地去想办法。后来，记者问他们：是什么力量促使你们这样去做的呢？这两个出生在西藏农奴家庭的子弟，笑了笑却反问了一句说：“为了我们西藏人的幸福，许多汉族工作人员和人民解放军战士流血流汗，甚至贡献出自己的生命，你说是什么力量促使他们这样去做的呢？”
    登山队队员永远也不会忘记气象工作人员在这次攀登珠穆朗玛峰的胜利中立下的功勋。气象工作人员就是以他们平凡的劳动，精确地计算出珠穆朗玛山区从5月19日到5月25日是一等好天气，从而使登山队掌握了最有利的时机，在坏天气到来以前，及时地发起突击，登上了顶峰。
    有一次，大队正准备从珠穆朗玛峰拔海六千四百米的第三号营地出发，攀登到拔海七千米以上的地区去。大本营的气象工作人员突然得到天气情报：拔海七千米以上将有大风雪降临。为了不让山上的战友们遭到风雪的袭击，大本营工作人员魏广福和谭克元，冒着风雪赶到拔海六千四百米的营地去为大队送信。从大本营到拔海六千四百米营地上升高度将近一千三百米，中间要不断穿过崎岖的山岩和危险的冰原。在登山队员们的计划行军中，原来需要走三天。但是，为了战友们的安全，魏广福和谭克元却坚持行进了二十多个小时，终于在当天深夜赶到了大队停留的地方，把天气预报交给了自己的战友们。当时，他们几乎连说话的力气都没有了，但是他们的嘴边显出了胜利的微笑。
    为了减轻突击顶峰的队员们的体力消耗，保证整个登山队的胜利，登山队的运输队员们把沉重的负担加到自己的肩上；为了让突击顶峰的队员们能够得到更多的人造氧气，运输队员们即使在拔海八千米以上的缺氧地区，背着三十多公斤重的东西，也很少甚至不用人造氧气，把氧气节省下来。
    在登山队里，像这样的“无名英雄”，是多么值得我们永远歌颂，永远学习的啊！医生吴永生自己身体不好，但他为了保证战友们的身体健康，冒着恶劣气候，穿过险峻的地形，随登山队到达了拔海七千米以上的地区；登山队的总务人员到处奔忙，从祖国各地运来了大批各种物资、装备，他们最先到达山区，又最后离开山区；报务人员使登山队日夜同祖国各地有关部门保持着紧密的联系；炊事人员每天为登山队员们作出可口的饭菜……。
    是的，我国的登山队员们就是这样地为集体事业而奋斗的。正如一位登山队员在自己的日记本上所写的：“集体是我的母亲，我是集体的儿子，没有集体也就没有了我。我要把生命鲜血无条件地全部贡献给集体，让微不足道的个人在伟大的集体中发出光和热。”
