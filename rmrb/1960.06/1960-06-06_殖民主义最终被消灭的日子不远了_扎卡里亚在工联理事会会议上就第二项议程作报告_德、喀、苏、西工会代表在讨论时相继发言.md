Xinhua News Agency, June 5th: The 11th Council Meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions continued this afternoon. Zakaria (Sudan), Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, reported on the second item on the agenda, "The Contribution of Trade Unions to the Struggle Against Colonialism."

Zakaria's report, delivered in Arabic and totaling over 20,000 words, was divided into four parts: (1) Development of the International Situation and the People's Struggle for National Independence; (2) The Plight of Workers Under Colonial Exploitation; (3) The Upsurge of Workers' Struggles; (4) Striving to Strengthen Unity.

In his report, Zakaria pointed out that the people's struggle against imperialism and colonialism for national independence is shaking the foundations of the outdated colonial system. The enormous development of the struggle against colonialism makes the day when colonialism is finally eliminated from the earth not far away, and the conditions for eliminating all forms of exploitation will also be more favorable.

The report mentioned that many newly independent countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have still not shaken off the serious remnants and influences of colonialism. Some territories of newly independent countries are still under colonial rule.

The report pointed out that US imperialism is the biggest enemy of the working class, and it is particularly important for the people of all colonial countries to strengthen their vigilance against US imperialism in the struggle for national independence.

The report called on the working class of the world to unite and further strengthen the struggle against colonialism. The report said that although the people of various colonial countries may still encounter many difficulties in the process of struggle, we believe that the day when the enslaved people of all countries will get rid of colonial rule is not far away.

After the second agenda item report ended, representatives of twenty advanced collectives and advanced producers from the capital, on behalf of all workers in Beijing, congratulated the Council.

Zhong Youzhi, driver of the China-Soviet Friendship Locomotive and National Advanced Producer, delivered a congratulatory message to the Council on behalf of the workers of Beijing, saying that we Chinese workers are building our motherland at high speed. The faster and larger the scale of our construction, the more it will add strength to the cause of defending world peace. He said that the awakened Chinese working class has long recognized that US imperialism is the number one enemy of world peace. The working class of the world and all peace-loving people should further unite, form a broad anti-imperialist united front, and persist in the struggle to surely defeat imperialism and achieve lasting world peace.

Then, the meeting began to discuss the two agenda items simultaneously.

Erich Wienke, Chairman of the Free German Trade Union Federation, spoke first. He emphasized that the attempt by US imperialism to tie West German and Japanese imperialism tightly to the Pentagon through the North Atlantic Treaty and military treaties is contrary to the interests of peace and the people of all countries, especially the interests of the people of West Germany, Japan, and the United States. He said that every blow against militarism is also a blow against US imperialism. For German workers, the struggle for peace is, in part, to build a close alliance between Japanese and German workers to counter the revival of German and Japanese militarism.

Wienke reminded people of the danger of collusion between the West German Adenauer Group and the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke Group to jointly develop nuclear armament. He said that the entire life of West Germany is increasingly subordinated to atomic armament and war preparations.

Wienke believed in his speech that if arms were ended, the West German people would not only be guaranteed lasting peace, but would also be able to save 12 billion marks of military spending each year, and the West German people would be able to enjoy an ever-improving standard of living.

He also expressed his support for signing a peace treaty that could truly subdue German militarism.

Wienke introduced the brilliant achievements created by the workers of the German Democratic Republic in socialist construction, and also particularly talked about the improvement of their workers' living standards.

Jacques Koum, Secretary-General of the Cameroon Workers' Union, spoke about the development of the African trade union movement and the Cameroon trade union movement in the past three years. He said that the African people's movement for national independence is surging, and struggles demanding an end to the colonial system have been launched everywhere. He said that the situation proves that the road for the African people to strive for freedom and liberation, oppose colonial enslavement, and demand the elimination of human exploitation in the world is correct.

Koum condemned the United States for sending spy planes to invade the Soviet Union, thereby undermining the summit conference. He said that this shows that US imperialism is unwilling to see reconciliation and peaceful coexistence between the major powers.

Viktor Grishin, Chairman of the Central Council of Trade Unions of the Soviet Union, emphasized at the beginning of his speech that maintaining and consolidating peace is the most important issue of concern to the people of all countries in the current situation. He said that the Soviet people are very concerned about maintaining peace, and the people of all countries hope for peace. But hope alone is not enough. What is important now is to raise the vigilance of the people, expose the conspiracies of imperialist aggressive forces, and strive to consolidate the principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems.

He said that the Soviet Union and other socialist countries are unremittingly struggling to stop a new war and ease international tensions.

Grishin exposed and condemned the aggressive crimes and war conspiracies of US imperialism. He said that while the Soviet Union and all socialist countries are engaged in constructive peaceful labor and tirelessly struggling to defend peace, a series of capitalist countries, especially the US imperialist bloc, are intensifying the arms race, fanning war hysteria, and carrying out blatant provocations against the Soviet Union and other socialist countries.

Grishin pointed out that the aggressive US imperialists are stepping up their arms expansion and war preparations, vigorously preparing all kinds of "spy satellites" and submarines that can launch missiles carrying nuclear weapons; American planes equipped with atomic and hydrogen bombs are flying day and night in the sky, and the US armed forces and the military bases established by US imperialism around socialist countries are conducting war preparations and various military exercises. He said that the unprecedented and shameless act of the United States sending planes to invade Soviet airspace and sabotage the Four-Power Summit has now been exposed before the world.

Grishin said that not long ago, the Presidium of the Central Council of Trade Unions of the Soviet Union, in the name of our 55 million members, unanimously supported and endorsed the position of Soviet Premier Khrushchev in Paris. This Leninist position, based on peaceful coexistence, equality, and respect for national sovereignty, is the only possible path to consolidate peace and the security of the people of all countries.

Grishin said that the Soviet Union now and in the future advocates peaceful coexistence, peaceful negotiations to reach reasonable, mutually acceptable agreements. He believes that if Western countries also work towards this end, if they stop their provocations against socialist countries, then the international situation will normalize, and in eight months, the Soviet Union will participate in the summit meeting. If this yields no results, our people will continue to wait for another US government, one that may show more rationality and more understanding of the urgent demands of the people of all countries and the current international situation. He added that, as facts show, the US imperialist bloc has taken aggressive actions against the Soviet Union, seeking to sharpen international relations.

The US Eisenhower administration played the shameful role of a gendarme, the role of a strangler of the freedom of the people of all countries, and it tried its best to support reactionary regimes that rely on US bayonets against the will of the people - the Spanish dictator Franco, the Chiang Kai-shek clique driven off the mainland by the great Chinese people, and the bloody executioner Syngman Rhee, who has been abandoned by the residents of South Korea. Eisenhower believes that these stranglers of the people are his best friends.

Grishin pointed out that the aggressive actions of the US ruling clique are a serious threat to world peace. Those countries that make their territories available as bases for US spy flights are in fact accomplices in US provocations.

Grishin spoke about the revival of West German and Japanese militarism, which seriously threatens world peace. He also spoke about the new proposals for complete and thorough disarmament put forward by the Soviet government on June 2.

Grishin said that the current international situation requires the working class and its trade union organizations and all working people to maintain a high degree of vigilance against the conspiracies of imperialism and to strengthen the struggle to maintain and consolidate peace. In his speech, Grishin spoke about the outstanding achievements of the Soviet people in implementing the seven-year plan for the comprehensive development of communist construction with unprecedented enthusiasm. Grishin described in detail the increase in wages, the reduction of working hours, and the improvement of the people's welfare in the Soviet Union in recent years and during the implementation of the seven-year plan.

Grishin said that the socialist camp is increasingly consolidated, and it is a strong fortress of peace and friendship among the people of all countries. The indestructible family of the Soviet Union, People's China, and all socialist countries is a great spiritual and material force, and it is a powerful obstacle in the path of imperialist conspiracies to push the people of all countries into a new abyss of world war.

He also said that all socialist countries, thanks to fraternal cooperation and mutual assistance, are accelerating their economic development. In 1965, the socialist camp will produce more than half of the world's industrial output. He believes that this will establish the prerequisites for eliminating world war from social life.

José Moix, President of the Spanish Workers' Confederation and a member of the World Federation of Trade Unions, spoke next. He said, "We agree to firmly condemn the provocative and aggressive actions of the United States against Soviet sovereignty and its double-dealing tactics, as well as the US government's violation of international law and international norms, the purpose of which is to undermine the holding of summit meetings."

José Moix said that after Eisenhower discussed with Franco the issue of setting up military bases in Spain for the revanchist troops of West Germany, "we see that the alliance formerly established by Hitler and Franco is now being re-established."

He said that the Spanish workers, together with other people, are increasingly and widely carrying out heroic struggles against the Franco fascist regime and its submission to US imperialism, for peace, against war, for democracy, freedom, social rights, and guaranteeing the people's living standards.

He said: "The change in the world situation gives us infinite confidence. We believe that the struggle of the Spanish working class and people, with international support, will be able to defeat the Franco tyranny, and a free and independent Spain will once again advance side by side with the most progressive people in the world."

At the afternoon meeting, congratulatory telegrams and letters from the General Union of Algerian Workers, the Jamaican Trade Union, the Council of the Greek Democratic Trade Union Movement, the Burmese People's Progressive Party, and the Cambodian Labor Progressive Association were also read. They expressed their firm belief that this meeting will contribute to the cause of opposing imperialism, opposing colonialism, and defending world peace and democracy.

    殖民主义最终被消灭的日子不远了
    扎卡里亚在工联理事会会议上就第二项议程作报告
    德、喀、苏、西工会代表在讨论时相继发言
    据新华社5日讯　世界工联第十一次理事会会议今天下午继续开会。世界工联书记扎卡里亚（苏丹）就会议的第二项议程“工会对反殖民主义斗争的贡献”作了报告。
    扎卡里亚用阿拉伯语言所作的长达两万多字的报告共分四个部分：（一）国际局势的发展和人民争取民族独立的斗争；（二）殖民剥削下的工人处境；（三）工人斗争的高涨；（四）争取加强统一团结。
    扎卡里亚在报告中指出，人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义争取民族独立的斗争，正在动摇着过了时的殖民主义制度的基础。反对殖民主义的斗争的巨大发展，使殖民主义最终从地球上被消灭的日子不远了，消灭一切剥削形式的条件也将要更加有利了。
    报告中谈到：亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的许多新独立的国家，仍然没有摆脱殖民主义的严重的残余和影响。新近独立的国家有一部分领土仍然在殖民主义统治下。
    报告指出，美帝国主义是工人阶级的最大的敌人，各殖民地国家的人民，在争取民族独立的斗争中，加强对美帝国主义的警惕是特别重要的。
    报告号召全世界工人阶级团结起来，进一步加强反殖民主义的斗争。报告说，尽管殖民地各国人民在斗争的进程中还可能遇到许多困难，但是我们相信被奴役的各国人民摆脱殖民统治的日子不远了。
    第二项议程报告结束以后，首都二十名先进集体的代表和先进生产者，代表北京全体工人向理事会祝贺。
    中苏友好号机车司机长、全国先进生产者钟有志，代表北京工人向理事会致贺词说，我们中国工人正在高速度地建设着自己的祖国，我们建设速度越快，规模越大，就会为保卫世界和平的事业增添力量。他说，觉悟了的中国工人阶级，早已认清了美帝国主义是世界和平的头号敌人。全世界工人阶级和一切爱好和平的人民进一步团结起来，结成广泛的反帝统一战线，坚持斗争，就一定能够打倒帝国主义，取得世界持久和平。
    接着，会议开始对两项议程同时进行讨论。
    自由德国工会联合会主席瓦恩克首先发言。他强调，美帝国主义通过北大西洋公约和军事条约把西德和日本帝国主义紧紧地拴在五角大楼的企图，是违反和平和各国人民的利益的，特别违反西德、日本和美国人民的利益。他说，对军国主义的每一次打击，同时也是对美帝国主义的打击。对于德国工人来说，争取和平的斗争，部分地是要在日本和德国工人之间建立紧密的同盟，以对付德国和日本军国主义的复活。
    瓦恩克提醒人们注意西德阿登纳集团和日本岸信介集团互相勾结，共同发展核武装的危险。他说，西德的整个生活都越来越厉害地从属于原子军备和战争准备。
    瓦恩克在讲话中这样认为，如果结束军备的话，西德人民就不仅能保证得到持久和平，而且每年有可能节省一百二十亿马克的军事预算，西德人民就能享受日益提高的生活水平。
    他还表示赞成签订一个真正能够制服德国军国主义的和约。
    瓦恩克介绍了德意志民主共和国工人在社会主义建设中创造的辉煌成就，还特别谈到他们工人生活水平提高的情况。
    喀麦隆工人联合会总书记杰克·高姆在发言中，谈到了非洲工会运动和喀麦隆工会运动近三年来的发展情况。他说，非洲人民争取民族独立的运动正在风起云涌，到处掀起了要求结束殖民主义制度的斗争。他说，形势证明，非洲人民争取自由、解放，反对殖民主义奴役，要求在世界上消灭人剥削人的现象的道路是正确的。
    高姆谴责美国派遣间谍飞机侵略苏联，从而破坏最高级会议的行为。他说，这表明美帝国主义不愿意看到大国之间的和解与和平共处。
    苏联工会中央理事会主席格里申在发言中一开始就强调，在当前形势下，维护和巩固和平是各国人民关心的最重要的问题。他说，苏联人民十分关心维护和平，各国人民都希望和平。但是只有一种希望是不够的。现在重要的是提高人民的警惕性，揭露帝国主义侵略势力的阴谋，力求使不同社会制度国家间的和平共处原则得到巩固。
    他说，苏联和各社会主义国家为制止新战争、和缓国际紧张局势，不懈地进行斗争。
    格里申揭露和谴责了美国帝国主义的侵略罪行和战争阴谋。他说，在苏联和所有社会主义国家从事着建设性的和平劳动，为保卫和平而不倦斗争的时候，一系列的资本主义国家、首先是美国帝国主义集团却正在加紧军备竞赛，煽起战争狂热，对苏联和其他社会主义国家进行公然的挑衅。
    格里申指出，侵略成性的美国帝国主义者正在加紧扩军备战，大力准备各种各样的“间谍卫星”以及携有核武器的能发射导弹的潜水艇；装有原子弹和氢弹的美国飞机昼夜不停地在天空飞行，美国的武装力量以及美帝国主义在社会主义国家周围建立的军事基地进行了战争准备，举行了各种各样的军事演习。他说，美国派遣飞机侵略苏联上空和破坏四国首脑会议的前所未闻的无耻行为，现在在全世界面前暴露了。
    格里申说，不久以前，苏联工会中央理事会主席团会议以我国五千五百万会员的名义，一致支持和赞成苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在巴黎声明的立场，这个以和平共处、平等和尊重国家主权为基础的列宁主义的立场，是巩固和平和各国人民安全的唯一可能的道路。
    格里申说，苏联现在和将来都主张和平共处，和平谈判争取达成合理的、双方能接受的协议。他认为，如果西方国家也为此努力，如果他们停止对社会主义国家的挑衅，那么国际局势就会正常，过了八个月之后，苏联将参加最高级会晤。如果这没有结果，我国人民就继续等待另一个美国政府，等到一个可能表示更多理智和对各国人民迫切要求和目前国际局势有更多理解的政府。他又说，正像事实所说明的那样，美帝国主义集团采取了反对苏联的侵略行动，力图使国际关系尖锐化。
    美国艾森豪威尔政府扮演了可耻的宪兵角色，扮演了各国人民自由的扼杀者的角色，他千方百计地支持违背人民的意志靠美国刺刀支撑的反动政权——西班牙的独裁者佛朗哥、被伟大的中国人民从大陆上赶出去的蒋介石集团、已被南朝鲜的居民所抛弃的血腥刽子手李承晚。艾森豪威尔认为，这些人民的扼杀者是他最好的朋友。
    格里申指出，美国统治集团的侵略行为是对世界和平的严重威胁。把自己的领土做为美国间谍飞行的基地的那些国家，实际上也做了美国挑衅的同谋者。
    格里申谈到西德和日本军国主义的复活，严重威胁着世界和平。他还谈到6月2日苏联政府提出的关于全面彻底裁军的新建议。
    格里申说，当前的国际局势要求工人阶级及其工会组织和全体劳动人民对帝国主义的阴谋保持高度的警惕性，加强维护和巩固和平的斗争。格里申在发言中谈到苏联人民正以空前的热情执行全面展开共产主义建设的七年计划并取得了杰出的成就。格里申详细叙述了最近几年来和实现七年计划过程中苏联提高工资缩短劳动日提高人民福利的情况。
    格里申说，社会主义阵营日益巩固，它是和平和各国人民之间友谊的强大堡垒，苏联、人民中国和所有社会主义国家的不可摧毁的大家庭，是一股伟大的精神力量和物质力量，它是帝国主义阴谋把各国人民推向新的世界大战深渊里去的道路上的强大障碍。
    他还说，所有的社会主义国家，由于兄弟般的合作和互助，都在加快自己的经济发展速度。在1965年社会主义阵营将生产全世界工业产品产量的一半以上。他认为，这样就将为从社会生活中消除世界大战建立先决条件。
    世界工联理事、西班牙工人联合会总主席何塞·莫伊克斯接着发言。他说，我们同意坚定地谴责美国对于苏联主权的挑衅性和侵略性的行动以及两面手法，也谴责美国政府违反国际法和国际的准则，其目的在于破坏高级会议的举行。
    何塞·莫伊克斯说，在艾森豪威尔同佛朗哥商谈在西班牙为西德复仇军队设立军事基地的问题之后，“我们就看到希特勒和佛朗哥从前建立的同盟，现在又建立起来了”。
    他说，西班牙工人和其他人民一道，正在日益广泛地开展着反对佛朗哥法西斯政权及其对美帝国主义的屈从，争取和平、反对战争，争取民主、自由、社会权利以及保障人民的生活水平的英勇斗争。
    他说：“世界局势的改变使我们具有无穷的信心。我们相信西班牙工人阶级和人民的斗争，在取得国际支援的情况下，将能击败佛朗哥暴政，自由和独立的西班牙将再度和世界上最进步的人民并肩前进。”
    在下午的会议上，还宣读了来自阿尔及利亚工会联合会、牙买加工会、希腊民主工会运动理事会、缅甸人民进步党和柬埔寨劳工进步协会的贺电和贺信。它们表示深信，这次会议将对反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义和保卫世界和平、民主的事业作出贡献。
