    The Erroneous Resolution of the International Commission for Vietnam Must Be Revoked
    By a Commentator of This Newspaper

    Xie Guangbao, Deputy Minister of National Defense of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, announced at a press conference held on June 3rd, a telegram sent by General Commander Vo Nguyen Giap of the Vietnamese People's Army to Mr. Ansari, Chairman of the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Vietnam, on May 27th. In the telegram, Vo Nguyen Giap expressed opposition to the International Commission's passing of a resolution, despite the Polish representative's firm opposition, which considered the U.S. imperialist military advisors replacing French military personnel in South Vietnam as "legal." In order to continue the implementation of the Geneva Accords, and to consolidate the cause of peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia, the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army requests the International Commission to: First, urge the South Vietnamese authorities to cease all activities that increase the number of U.S. military personnel stationed in South Vietnam, and to disband and withdraw the "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group." Second, rescind the aforementioned resolution of the International Commission to avoid serious consequences for the continued implementation of the Geneva Accords and the consolidation of peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia. The demands made by the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army to the International Commission for Vietnam are undoubtedly correct and reasonable, and the Chinese people express their firm support for them.

    As is well known, the "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group" stationed in South Vietnam is a tool for U.S. imperialism to carry out intervention and prepare for war in South Vietnam. This organization, which includes land, air, and naval forces, as well as various departments such as combat training, transportation, intelligence, inspection, and supply, is even larger than the South Vietnamese Ministry of National Defense. It has unlimited power, from training troops and mobilizing troops, to reviewing the South Vietnamese "defense" budget, and strictly controls the entire South Vietnamese army. After the restoration of peace in Indochina, the "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group" not only failed to withdraw from South Vietnam in a timely manner as stipulated by the Geneva Accords, but on the contrary, the number of military personnel has been increasing, and the military organization has been expanding. The number of U.S. military personnel has increased from two hundred at the time of the armistice to more than two thousand at present. They not only directly participated in the construction of armed forces, military bases, and strategic highways in South Vietnam, but also directly participated in the "mopping-up" campaigns to massacre former resistance personnel. Since the armistice, the continued existence of the "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group" and its activities over the years have fully demonstrated that it is a tool for U.S. imperialism to permanently divide Vietnam and turn South Vietnam into a U.S. colony and military base in Southeast Asia. It completely serves the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to invade Southeast Asia and the Far East. In order to guarantee the implementation of the Geneva Accords and maintain peace and security in Indochina, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has repeatedly requested the International Commission for Vietnam to urge the complete withdrawal of the "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group" from South Vietnam in accordance with the Geneva Accords. However, the International Commission for Vietnam has not only ignored the legitimate demands of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and taken necessary measures to maintain peace in the region, but has instead distorted the Geneva Accords to give the U.S. imperialist tool for preparing for war a legal veneer to remain in South Vietnam for a long time, paving the way for the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to intensify the tense situation in Indochina by using this tool. The consequences of this action by the International Commission for Vietnam are serious, and it cannot but arouse the attention and opposition of all countries and people concerned about peace and security in Indochina.

    The International Commission for Vietnam, disregarding the firm opposition of the Polish representative, passed a resolution considering the act of U.S. military advisors replacing French military personnel in South Vietnam as "legal," which is a complete violation of the Geneva Accords. The Geneva Accords and the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference clearly stipulate that French troops should withdraw from Vietnamese territory. At the same time, Article 16 of the Geneva Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam stipulates that "from the time this Agreement takes effect, all reinforcements of troops and additional military personnel are prohibited from entering Vietnam." Paragraph 4 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference also stipulates that foreign troops and military personnel are prohibited from entering Vietnam. It can be seen that the final withdrawal of French troops from Vietnam is a natural step and is in line with the obligations undertaken by the French government and confirmed by the Geneva Accords. Therefore, there is no question of any foreign troops or military personnel replacing French troops or military personnel. Making the excuse of replacing former French military personnel and recognizing the U.S. military advisors staying in South Vietnam, who are aimed at interfering in South Vietnam and preparing for war, as "legal" can only be regarded as a gross distortion of the Geneva Accords, and the result will inevitably be detrimental to peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia. The Polish representative of the International Commission for Vietnam took a firm stand against this resolution, which is entirely correct. It is regrettable that the representatives of India and Canada, the other two members of the International Commission for Vietnam responsible for supervising and monitoring the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam, have taken actions that are completely contrary to the letter and spirit of the Geneva Accords. This is not only an abandonment of duty, but in fact contributes to the actions of U.S. imperialism and the South Vietnamese authorities in undermining the Geneva Accords and endangering peace in Indochina. In order to ensure the continued implementation of the Geneva Accords, and to consolidate peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia, the Chinese people firmly support the two demands made by the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army to the International Commission for Vietnam: The "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group" must cease its activities and withdraw from South Vietnam! The resolution recognizing the stationing of U.S. military advisors in South Vietnam as "legal" must be rescinded!

    越南国际委员会的错误决议必须撤消
    本报评论员
    越南民主共和国国防部副部长谢光宝在6月3日举行的记者招待会上，公布了越南人民军总司令武元甲5月27日打给越南国际监督和监察委员会主席安萨里的一封电报。武元甲在电报中表示反对国际委员会不顾波兰代表的坚决反对，通过认为美帝国主义的军事顾问在南越取代法国军事人员的行为是“合法的”决议。为了继续执行日内瓦协议，为了巩固印度支那和东南亚的和平事业，越南人民军总司令部要求国际委员会：一、促使南越当局停止增加驻南越美国军事人员的一切活动，解散和撤走“美国军事援助顾问团”。二、取消国际委员会的上述决议，以避免对继续执行日内瓦协议和巩固印度支那和东南亚和平发生严重后果。越南人民军总司令部向越南国际委员会提出的要求无疑是正确和合理的，对此，中国人民表示坚决支持。
    如所周知，驻南越的“美国军事援助顾问团”是美帝国主义在南越进行干涉和准备战争的工具。这个包括陆、空、海军，以及作战训练、运输、情报、检查、供应等各部门的组织，比南越国防部还要庞大。它具有从训练军队、调动军队，一直到审查南越“国防”预算的无限权力，严密控制着整个南越军队。印度支那和平恢复后，“美国军事援助顾问团”非但不按照日内瓦协议的规定及时撤出南越，相反的，军事人员越来越增加，军事组织越来越庞大。美国军事人员由停战时的二百人增加到目前的二千多人。他们不仅直接参加了南越的武装力量、军事基地和战略公路的建设工作，而且直接参加了残杀前抗战人员的“扫荡”战役。停战以来，“美国军事援助顾问团”的继续存在和它几年来的活动已经充分证明：它是美帝国主义长期分割越南、把南越变成美国在东南亚的殖民地和军事基地的工具，它是完全服务于美帝国主义侵略东南亚和远东地区的阴谋的。为了保证日内瓦协议的实施，维护印度支那的和平与安全，越南民主共和国曾经多次要求越南国际委员会根据日内瓦协议促使“美国军事援助顾问团”全部撤出南越。然而，越南国际委员会非但无视越南民主共和国的正当要求，采取必要的措施以维护这一地区的和平，反而歪曲日内瓦协议，为美帝国主义的这个准备战争的工具长期赖在南越披上合法的外衣，为美帝国主义利用这个工具加紧制造印度支那紧张局势的阴谋开辟道路。越南国际委员会这一行动的后果是严重的，它不能不引起所有关心印度支那和平与安全的国家和人民的注意和反对。
    越南国际委员会不顾波兰代表的坚决反对，通过认为美国军事顾问在南越取代法国军事人员的行为是“合法的”决议，是完全违反日内瓦协议的。日内瓦协议以及日内瓦会议的最后宣言明白规定，法国军队应从越南领土撤退。同时日内瓦协议关于越南停止敌对行动的协定第十六条规定“自本协定生效时起，禁止一切增援部队和新增的军事人员进入越南”。日内瓦会议最后宣言的第四段也规定禁止外国军队和军事人员进入越南。可见，法国军队的最后撤出越南是当然的步骤，也是符合法国政府所承担并经日内瓦协议所确认的义务的。因此根本不存在任何外国军队或军事人员来代替法国军队或军事人员的问题。借口代替前法国军事人员，承认以干涉南越和准备战争为目的的美国军事顾问留在南越是“合法的”这种作法，只能被认做是对日内瓦协议的莫大歪曲，其结果必然对印度支那和东南亚地区的和平不利。越南国际委员会的波兰代表采取坚决反对这一决议的立场是十分正确的。遗憾的是，负责监督和监察日内瓦协议在越南实施的越南国际委员会其他两个成员印度和加拿大的代表，竟然采取了同日内瓦协议的文字和精神完全背道而驰的行动。这不仅是放弃职责，而且在实际上助长美帝国主义和南越当局破坏日内瓦协议、危害印度支那和平的行动。为了保障日内瓦协议的继续执行，为了巩固印度支那和东南亚的和平，中国人民坚决支持越南人民军总司令部对越南国际委员会提出的两项要求：“美国军事援助顾问团”停止活动、撤出南越！取消承认美国军事顾问驻留南越是“合法的”决议！
