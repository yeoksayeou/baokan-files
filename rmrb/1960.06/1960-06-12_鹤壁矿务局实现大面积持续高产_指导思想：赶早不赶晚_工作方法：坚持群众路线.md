    Hebi Mining Bureau Achieves Large-Scale Sustained High Yield
    Guiding Ideology: Sooner Rather Than Later; Working Method: Adhering to the Mass Line
    (Our report) The Hebi Mining Bureau in Henan Province, based on the spirit of "Rushing forward in everything, striving for initiative at every step," implemented a relatively complete set of mass line working methods. Since the beginning of this year, it has overfulfilled its coal production plan every month, winning the victory of a thriving production and sustained large-scale high yield.

    Coal Production Increases Month by Month
      High Quality and Low Consumption Achieve Overall Leap Forward
    In the first quarter of this year, the average daily output of raw coal at this bureau increased by 22.9% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The average daily output in April increased by 5.7% compared to the first quarter, and May increased by 14.1% compared to April. The efficiency of all employees averaged 1.268 tons per work shift last year, 1.613 tons in the first quarter of this year, 1.652 tons in April, and 1.921 tons in May. May's output increased by 51.5% compared to last year. The consumption of pit props and the cost of raw coal have gradually decreased. The ash content of raw coal has been lower than the planned control targets month after month, and the quality has met standards. The bureau has also eliminated major accidents and achieved safe production.
    The main reasons for the outstanding achievements of the Hebi Mining Bureau are: leading cadres at all levels recognized the objective situation of the sustained Great Leap Forward in China's socialist construction, strengthened their confidence in thoroughly breaking the old "routine" of being slack at the beginning of the year and tight at the end, slack at the beginning of the quarter and tight at the end, slack at the beginning of the month and tight at the end. They firmly established the guiding ideology of "Rushing forward in everything, striving for initiative at every step, grasping current high production with one hand, and grasping preparations for future high production with the other," and fully mobilized the masses through a relatively complete set of mass line working methods, concretely implementing this guiding ideology into practical work.

    Great Emphasis on the First Ten Days of Each Month
    Great Emphasis on the First Few Days of Each Ten-Day Period
    Great Emphasis on the First Shift of Each Day
    The bureau begins to arrange the production plan for the next month on the 20th of each month, and submits it to the workers for discussion before the 25th. Planning is arranged and issued early, measures are ordered at all levels, guarantees are proposed at all levels, and the plan is implemented among the masses, turning it into the actual actions of the masses. This lays a solid mass foundation for overfulfilling the state plan month after month.
    In terms of output arrangement in the operation plan, the bureau requires that the first ten days of the month complete 35% to 40% of the monthly plan, the cumulative completion of the monthly plan is around 75% by the middle ten days, and the monthly planned output is completed around the 25th of each month. In the last few days, while striving for a large overproduction, they free up enough time and manpower to prepare for the sustained high production of the next month.
    When implementing the operation plan, the bureau places great emphasis on the first ten days of each month, great emphasis on the first three to five days of each ten-day period, and great emphasis on the first shift of each day. The specific methods are: in the first three to five days of the first ten days of the month, a "good start" is launched to break through the production level of the previous month. The following days consolidate this new production level and prepare for production in the middle ten days; in the first three to five days of the middle ten days, a "high-yield day" is launched (some mines have a "high-yield day" every three days in the middle ten days) to further improve the production level of the first ten days; in the last ten days, while consolidating this new production level, great emphasis is placed on production preparation to ensure a good start for the next month. Each day is "the first shift exceeds, the second shift catches up, and the third shift takes responsibility." This approach has promoted the continuous advance of production surges.

    Grasp Current High Production with One Hand
      Grasp Preparations for the Next Step with the Other
    While organizing high production, the bureau always pays attention to preparing for the next stage of production. Each production mine has a deputy mine director responsible for production preparation. A balance check of mining (coal) and tunneling (development), electromechanical equipment maintenance, and material supply is conducted every ten days. The bureau conscientiously promoted various advanced experiences in rapid tunneling to ensure the normal continuation of mining and tunneling. It established a designated electromechanical responsibility system by district and line, and implemented the method of "breaking down into parts and rotating maintenance," making full use of the gaps in production to repair and maintain equipment, ensuring the safe operation of electromechanical equipment. Material management personnel also go deep into the front line to understand the urgent needs of production at any time, prepare materials on time, and deliver materials to the door, ensuring the timely supply of materials.
    The new upsurge of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement since the beginning of this year has played a significant role in the leap forward in production. The technical innovation and technical revolution movement of the bureau has always started from the needs of production and closely revolved around the key points of production. They organize battles in batches and phases, besiege key points, and constantly promote, consolidate, and improve innovation achievements. At present, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of the bureau has been greatly improved, and one hundred and eighteen electromechanical equipment have achieved single-machine automation, establishing forty-four automatic production lines and linkage lines, saving more than three thousand three hundred laborers, supporting new mines, and enriching the production front line.

    Leading Personnel Go Deep into the Front Line
      Constantly Overcoming Weak Links
    The leading cadres of the Hebi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Hebi Mining Bureau often go deep into the front line, lead the masses among the masses, lead production in production, and constantly discover and overcome weak links. In underground production, the party secretary or mine director works and directs production with the shift every shift. From the party secretary and mine director to all department cadres, they have fixed sections to participate in physical labor. Generally, the time spent in the well participating in labor accounts for one-third of the working days each month. They contract by district, contract for ideological mobilization, contract for completing tasks, contract for safe production, and contract for promoting advanced experience. This closely combines cadres participating in labor and going deep into the front line with promoting a leap forward in production.

    鹤壁矿务局实现大面积持续高产
    指导思想：赶早不赶晚　工作方法：坚持群众路线
    本报讯　河南省鹤壁矿务局根据“一切往前赶，步步争主动”的精神，实行了一套比较完整的群众路线的工作方法，今年以来月月超额完成产煤计划，赢得了生产蒸蒸日上、持续大面积高产的胜利。
    煤炭产量月月增长
      优质低耗全面跃进
    今年第一季度，这个局的原煤平均日产量比去年第四季度提高了22．9％，4月份平均日产量比第一季度提高了5．7％，5月份比4月份又提高了14．1％。全员效率去年每工平均为1．268吨，今年第一季度为1．613吨，4月份为1．652吨，5月份为1．921吨，5月份比去年提高了51．5％。坑木消耗量和原煤成本都逐步降低。原煤灰份月月低于计划控制指标，质量合乎标准。这个局还消灭了重大事故，作到了安全生产。
    鹤壁矿务局取得上述出色成就的主要原因是：各级领导干部认清我国社会主义建设持续大跃进的客观形势，坚定了彻底打破年初松、年末紧，季初松、季末紧，月初松、月末紧，这一旧“常规”的信心，巩固地树立了“一切往前赶，步步争主动，一手抓当前高产，一手抓以后高产准备”的指导思想，并且通过一套比较完整的群众路线的工作方法，充分发动群众，把这一指导思想具体贯彻到实际工作中去。
    每月大抓第一旬
    每旬大抓头几天
    每天大抓头一班
    这个局每月20日就开始安排下个月的生产计划，25日以前交给工人讨论。计划早安排，早下达，层层订措施，层层提保证，计划落实到群众，变成了群众的实际行动。这便为月月超额完成国家计划打下了巩固的群众基础。
    在作业计划的产量安排方面，这个局要求上旬完成全月计划的35％到40％，中旬累计完成全月计划的75％左右，每月25日前后完成全月计划产量，最后几天在争取大超产的同时，腾出足够的时间和力量为下月的持续高产做好一切准备。
    这个局在执行作业计划时，每月大抓上旬，每旬大抓头三、五天，每天大抓头一班。具体作法是：上旬头三、五天大搞“开门红”，突破上个月的生产水平，后几天巩固这一新的生产水平并为中旬做好生产准备；中旬头三、五天大搞“高产日”（有的矿在中旬每三天搞一个“高产日”）把上旬的生产水平再提高一步；下旬在巩固这一新的生产水平的同时，大抓生产准备，保证下月开门红，每天则是“头班超，二班赶，三班包”。这种作法推动了生产高潮一浪高一浪地滚滚向前。
    一手抓当前高产
      一手抓下步准备
    这个局在组织高产的同时，始终注意抓下一步生产的准备，各个生产矿井都有一个副矿长负责抓生产准备工作，每旬进行一次采（煤）掘（进）衔接、机电设备检修和材料供应的平衡排队。这个局认真推广了快速掘进的各项先进经验，保证了采掘的正常接续；建立了分区分线的机电专责制，推行了“化整为零、轮流检修”的办法，充分利用生产的间隙时间检修维护设备，保证了机电设备安全运转。材料管理人员也深入现场，随时了解生产急需，按时备料，送料上门，保证了材料的及时供应。
    今年以来的技术革新和技术革命运动新高潮对生产跃进起了很大作用。这个局的技术革新和技术革命运动始终是从生产需要出发，紧密围绕着生产关键进行的。他们分期分批地组织战役，围攻重点，并且不断地推广、巩固和提高革新成果。目前，这个局的机械化、半机械化程度已有很大提高，并且有一百一十八台机电设备实现了单机自动化，建立了四十四条生产自动线和联动线，节省出三千三百多个劳动力，支援了新井，充实了生产第一线。
    领导人员深入现场
      不断克服薄弱环节
    中共鹤壁市委和鹤壁矿务局的领导干部都经常深入现场，在群众中领导群众，在生产中领导生产，不断发现薄弱环节，克服薄弱环节。井下生产，班班都有党委书记或矿长跟班劳动，指挥生产。从党委书记、矿长到全体科室干部都固定了参加体力劳动的地段，一般每月下井参加劳动的时间占三分之一的工作日。他们分区包干，包思想发动，包完成任务，包安全生产，包推广先进经验。这样就使干部参加劳动、深入前线，同促进生产跃进紧密结合起来。
