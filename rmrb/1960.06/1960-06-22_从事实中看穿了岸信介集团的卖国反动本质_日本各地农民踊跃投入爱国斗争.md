　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 21st: News from Tokyo: Farmers across Japan are eagerly participating in the patriotic and just struggle against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

　　In the 18th National Unified Action from June 11th to 19th, the central and local organizations of the All-Japan Farmers Association Federation participated in unified actions against the new "Security Treaty" in various places, and sent representatives to Tokyo to participate in protest rallies and demonstrations in front of the Diet, the U.S. Embassy, and the Prime Minister's residence. The farmer representatives all held up banners made of straw mats, with political slogans written on them such as: "Kishi Nobusuke step down," "Dissolve the Diet," "Oppose Eisenhower's visit to Japan," and "Smash the Security Treaty." Japanese newspapers pointed out that this marks the beginning of Japanese farmers' active participation in the anti-U.S. movement.

　　With the deepening development of the movement against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, the rural areas that were once regarded by the Liberal Democratic Party as being under its control have undergone great changes today. Through the facts, the farmers have seen through the mask of the Kishi Nobusuke group, which is subservient to U.S. imperialism and intensifying its restoration of militarism, and they are bravely taking action. For example, on the day of the general strike on June 4th, there were as many as fifteen villages in Iwate Prefecture alone that held rallies against the new "Security Treaty"; Nagano Prefecture has more than two hundred organizations of farmers opposing the new "Security Treaty"; and farmers in Gunma, Okayama, and other prefectures have also participated in various patriotic activities.

　　Japanese rural youth are even more active in participating in the struggle against the new "Security Treaty." The Democratic Youth League in Nagano, Ibaraki, Fukuoka, Hiroshima and other prefectures, and the Japan Youth Council in Chiba, Kyoto, Ehime, Okayama and other prefectures, have launched vigorous activities.

　　The movement initiated by the Japanese Communist Party to collect three million signatures protesting against the signing of the new "Security Treaty" by the Japanese and U.S. governments is being widely carried out in rural Japan and has achieved great success. Niigata, Saga, Mie, Tokushima, Fukuoka, Nagano, Gifu, Fukui, Kumamoto, Oita and other prefectures have all exceeded their predetermined targets. Even some members of the Liberal Democratic Party in the rural department of Tokorozawa City, Saitama Prefecture, who were once "commended" by Kishi Nobusuke last year, have participated in the signature campaign against the new "Security Treaty" and protesting the Japanese and U.S. governments.

### 从事实中看穿了岸信介集团的卖国反动本质  日本各地农民踊跃投入爱国斗争

    从事实中看穿了岸信介集团的卖国反动本质
    日本各地农民踊跃投入爱国斗争
    新华社21日讯　东京消息：日本全国各地农民正在踊跃参加反对新日美“安全条约”的爱国正义斗争。
    在从6月11日到19日的第十八次全国统一行动中，全日本农民协会联合会的中央和地方组织，都参加了各地的反对新“安全条约”的统一行动，并且派代表到东京去参加在国会、美国大使馆和首相官邸前面的抗议集会和示威游行。农民代表都高举着用草席作的标语牌，上面写着：“岸信介下台”、“解散国会”、“反对艾森豪威尔访日”和“粉碎安全条约”等政治口号。日本报纸指出，这标志着日本农民开始积极参加反美运动。
    随着反对日美军事同盟条约运动的深入发展，过去一直被自由民主党看作是它可以控制的农村，今天已经起了很大变化。农民通过事实看穿了屈从美帝国主义、加紧恢复军国主义的岸信介集团的假面具，他们奋勇行动起来。例如，在6月4日总罢工那天，只在岩手县就有十五个农村举行了反对新“安全条约”的集会；长野县的农民反对新“安全条约”组织有二百多个；群马、冈山等各县农民也都参加了各种爱国活动。
    日本农村青年参加反对新“安全条约”的斗争更为积极。长野、茨城、福冈、广岛等县的民主青年同盟和千叶、京都、爱媛、冈山等县的日本青年协议会，都展开了强有力的活动。
    由日本共产党发起的征集三百万人签名抗议日、美两国政府签订新“安全条约”的运动，正在日本农村广泛展开，并且取得了很大成就。新潟、佐贺、三重、德岛、福冈、长野、岐阜、福井、熊本、大分等各县都突破了预定指标。去年曾经受到岸信介“表扬”的埼玉县所泽市的农村部的自由民主党党员，也有人参加了反对新“安全条约”和抗议日、美政府的签名运动。
