Inherit and Carry Forward the Glorious Tradition of the *Xiangjiang Review*
Zhang Pinghua, First Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

Editor's Note: The theoretical journal of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, *Study Guide*, will be renamed *New Xiang Review* starting from July 1st. The Hunan Provincial Committee stated in its decision on the renaming that the reason for renaming it *New Xiang Review* is to inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of the *Xiangjiang Review*. The *Xiangjiang Review* was a revolutionary publication founded by Comrade Mao Zedong in Hunan in 1919. It actively promoted anti-imperialist and anti-feudal democratic revolutionary ideas, and praised the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution. It played a pioneering role in spreading Marxism in our country, promoting the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party, and promoting the development of the Chinese revolutionary movement. This publication, with its simple materialistic viewpoint and fearless revolutionary spirit, advocated breaking superstitions, liberating the mind, not fearing imperialism, not fearing warlords and bureaucrats, not fearing capitalists, not fearing heaven, not fearing ghosts, uniting to make revolution, etc. It can be said to be the germination point of Mao Zedong Thought, which combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practices of the Chinese revolution. Over the past forty years, Comrade Mao Zedong's thought has been gloriously developed. In the historical conditions of the modern era, Comrade Mao Zedong has creatively and greatly developed Marxism-Leninism in various aspects. Under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, our country is in a new historical era of high-speed socialist construction. *New Xiang Review* must hold even higher the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further strengthen the Party spirit and combat effectiveness of Marxism-Leninism, strengthen the connection between theory and practice, and publicize Marxism-Leninism in a popular and vivid way, publicize the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, which combines the concrete practices of the Chinese revolution, and under the guidance of the Party's general line, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, educate and encourage the people of Hunan Province to bravely advance along the road of socialism and communism.

The inaugural issue of *New Xiang Review* features an article by Comrade Zhang Pinghua, First Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, expounding on the glorious tradition of *Xiangjiang Review*. The Party's newspapers and periodicals should inherit and carry forward this glorious tradition of the *Xiangjiang Review*. This newspaper specially publishes Comrade Zhang Pinghua's article here.

July 14th this year marks the forty-first anniversary of the founding of the *Xiangjiang Review*.

The *Xiangjiang Review* was a famous publication founded by Comrade Mao Zedong in Changsha in 1919. It was a very outstanding revolutionary publication during the "May Fourth" Movement in our country, and it was a glorious red banner in the history of the Chinese revolution. It played a positive role in promoting the development of the Chinese revolutionary struggle and the formation of the Chinese Communist Party.

Today, forty years later, in a time when the Chinese people's democratic revolution has achieved victory, and the socialist revolution and socialist construction have achieved great success, we feel very honored and delighted to be able to use the glorious title of *New Xiang Review* to call our theoretical journal of the Hunan Provincial Committee. At the same time, we also feel that our responsibility is very heavy. *New Xiang Review* is the *Xiangjiang Review* of the new era, and it must inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of the *Xiangjiang Review*, hold high the red banner of Marxism-Leninism, the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism combined with the concrete practices of the Chinese revolution and Mao Zedong Thought, and bravely advance.

The *Xiangjiang Review*, which was run by Comrade Mao Zedong, had its own temporality. At that time, the Chinese Communist Party had not yet been established. The anti-imperialist and anti-feudal political program promoted by the *Xiangjiang Review* could not be as thorough and complete as the New Democratic Revolution program later expounded by Comrade Mao Zedong; however, in the article "The Great Union of the Masses" published in the *Xiangjiang Review*, one can already see the seeds of the idea of the People's Democratic United Front. The *Xiangjiang Review* has many excellent characteristics worth learning from. Limited by my own historical knowledge and ideological level, I cannot comprehensively and systematically explain its characteristics. Here, I only put forward the following three points for comrades to study and research for reference.

First, it is the revolutionary spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, daring to act, and being unstoppable. Just open the inaugural issue and you can see:
	“Don't be afraid of anything, don't be afraid of heaven, don't be afraid of ghosts, don't be afraid of the dead, don't be afraid of bureaucrats, don't be afraid of warlords, don't be afraid of capitalists," and other inspiring and morale-boosting great calls. In its various regular issues and temporary supplements, every commentary and every piece of news fully demonstrates the militancy of mobilizing the masses to strike at the enemy. *Loud Remarks* and *Miscellaneous Comments* are a batch of daggers that stab the enemy's vital points. Reading the *Xiangjiang Review* can not only make people spirited and full of fighting spirit, but also enable people to break superstitions and liberate their minds.

Second, it is the scientific attitude of being targeted and seeking truth from facts. Although Comrade Mao Zedong had not yet been able to read the classic works of Marxism-Leninism at that time, the viewpoints and methods he used to analyze the Chinese situation and the international situation at that time were in line with Marxism-Leninism. For example, the analysis of the Revolution of 1911, the analysis of the degree of awareness and organization of the people during the "May Fourth" Movement, and the analysis of the historical situation of Hunan and the huge changes it was facing were all based on seeking truth from facts, and were both materialistic and dialectical. This simple dialectical materialist viewpoint and method has been gloriously developed in the subsequent revolutionary struggle and Party building process. The Chinese Communists, represented by Comrade Mao Zedong, not only studied and disseminated Marxism-Leninism, but also combined the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practices of the Chinese revolution, and developed Marxism-Leninism to a new stage according to the historical conditions of the new era. This is our Party's guiding ideology, namely the great Mao Zedong Thought. This is Comrade Mao Zedong's great contribution to creatively applying and developing Marxism-Leninism in the practice of the Chinese revolution. This is a great contribution to the cause of the Chinese Party and people, and also a great contribution to the international communist movement. Mao Zedong Thought is the victorious banner of the people's democratic revolution and socialist revolution, and is the guiding light for socialist construction and the communist movement. Tall buildings rise from the ground. From the *Xiangjiang Review*, which was originally run by Comrade Mao Zedong, one can see the initial foundation stones of the tall building of Mao Zedong Thought.

Third, it is the accurate, clear, and lively writing style. Comrade Mao Zedong ran the *Xiangjiang Review* without old stereotypes or foreign stereotypes. It accurately and fiercely attacked the enemy's vital points. It always guided and supported the revolutionary struggles and new things of the people with full enthusiasm. The establishment of academic research groups such as the "Healthy Society" was considered an insignificant "trivial matter" by those empty talkers, but Comrade Mao Zedong adopted a warm support and patient help attitude. The *Xiangjiang Review* used a lot of space to introduce it and comment on it. The writing of the *Xiangjiang Review* is lively, rich and colorful. It has "articles as long as a snake" (such as the article "The Great Union of the Masses" which was serialized in three issues); but more are concise and powerful short comments, miscellaneous comments and briefs, tens of words, hundreds of words, thousands of words, every word and every sentence has its weight, hitting the nail on the head, making people either furious, or relieved, or standing upright, or bowing their heads in deep thought. Whether it is a long article or a short article, it is made as popular and vivid as possible, so that even illiterate people can understand it.

All these characteristics reflect a common essence, that is, the Party spirit, the people's character, and the combativeness of the publication. We must inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of the *Xiangjiang Review*, mobilize the whole Party, and strive to run our theoretical journal well, so that it deserves to be a *Xiangjiang Review* of the new era.

    继承和发扬《湘江评论》的光荣传统
    中共湖南省委第一书记　张平化
    编者按：中共湖南省委的理论刊物《学习导报》，自7月1日起改名为《新湘评论》。湖南省委在关于改名的决定中说：所以要改名为《新湘评论》，是为了继承和发扬《湘江评论》的光荣传统。《湘江评论》是毛泽东同志1919年在湖南创办的一个革命刊物，它积极地宣传反帝反封建的民主革命思想，歌颂伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利，对于后来在我国传播马克思主义，促成中国共产党的建立和推动中国革命运动的发展，起了开路先锋的作用。这个刊物用朴素的唯物主义观点和大无畏的革命精神，提倡破除迷信，解放思想，不怕帝国主义，不怕军阀和官僚，不怕资本家，不怕天，不怕鬼，联合起来闹革命等等，可以说是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想的萌芽。四十年来，毛泽东同志的这种思想，得到了光辉的发展。在现代的历史条件下，毛泽东同志在各个方面创造性的大大发展了马克思列宁主义。在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，我国正处于高速度建设社会主义的新的历史时代。《新湘评论》必须更高地举起毛泽东思想的红旗，进一步加强马克思列宁主义的党性和战斗性，加强理论和实际的联系，通俗而生动地宣传马克思列宁主义，宣传马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想，在党的总路线的指引下，在党中央和毛泽东同志的英明领导下，教育和鼓舞湖南省人民，沿着社会主义、共产主义的大道奋勇前进。
    《新湘评论》发刊号，中共湖南省委第一书记张平化同志写了文章阐述《湘江评论》的光荣传统；党的报刊都应当继承和发扬《湘江评论》的这种光荣传统。本报特将张平化同志的文章发表在这里。
    今年7月14日，是《湘江评论》创刊的四十一周年。
    《湘江评论》是毛泽东同志1919年在长沙创办的著名刊物。它是我国“五四”运动时期一个非常出色的革命刊物，它是中国革命史上一面光辉的红旗。它对中国革命斗争的发展和中国共产党的形成起了积极的推动作用和组织作用。
    在四十年以后的今天，在中国人民民主革命已经获得胜利、社会主义革命和社会主义建设已经获得巨大成就的今天，我们能够用《新湘评论》这个光荣称号，来称呼我们湖南省委的理论刊物，我们感到非常的荣幸和喜悦，同时也感到我们的责任非常重大。《新湘评论》是新时代的《湘江评论》，必须继承和发扬《湘江评论》的光荣传统，高举起马克思列宁主义、马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想的红旗奋勇前进。
    毛泽东同志主办的《湘江评论》是有它的时代性的。当时中国共产党还没有成立。《湘江评论》所宣传的反帝、反封建的政治纲领还不可能像后来由毛泽东同志所阐明的新民主主义革命纲领那样彻底和完整；但就在《湘江评论》刊载的《民众大联合》一文中已可看到人民民主统一战线思想的萌芽。《湘江评论》有许多优良的特色值得学习。我限于自己的历史知识和思想水平，不可能全面系统地来说明它的特色。在这里只提出以下三点，供同志们学习和研究的参考。
    第一，是敢想敢说敢干、势如破竹的革命气概。只要翻开创刊号一看，就可以看到：
  “什么不要怕，天不要怕，鬼不要怕，死人不要怕，官僚不要怕，军阀不要怕，资本家不要怕”等类振奋人心、鼓舞斗志的伟大号召。在它的各期本刊和临时增刊中，每一篇评论，每一条新闻，都充分地表现了发动群众打击敌人的战斗性，而《放言》和《杂评》则是一批刺中敌人要害的匕首。读了《湘江评论》，不但能够使人意气风发，斗志昂扬，而且能够使人破除迷信、解放思想。
    第二，是有的放矢、实事求是的科学态度。毛泽东同志当时虽然还没有能够读到马克思列宁主义的经典著作，但是他当时用来分析中国情况和国际情况的观点和方法是符合马克思列宁主义的。例如对于辛亥革命的分析，对于“五四”运动时期人民群众的觉悟程度和组织程度的分析，对于湖南的历史情况和当时面临着巨大变化的分析，都是实事求是的，是唯物的又是辩证的。这种朴素的辩证唯物主义的观点和方法，在后来的革命斗争和党的建设过程中，得到了光辉的发展，以毛泽东同志为代表的中国共产党人，不仅学习和传播马克思列宁主义，而且把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践结合起来，根据新时代的历史条件，使马克思列宁主义发展到新的阶段。这就是我们党的指导思想，即伟大的毛泽东思想。这是毛泽东同志在中国革命的实践中，创造性地应用和发展马克思列宁主义的伟大贡献，这是对中国党和人民事业的伟大贡献，也是对国际共产主义运动的伟大贡献。毛泽东思想，是人民民主革命和社会主义革命的胜利旗帜，是社会主义建设和共产主义运动的指路明灯。万丈高楼从地起，毛泽东思想的万丈高楼，从毛泽东同志早期主办的《湘江评论》里可以看到它最初的若干基石。
    第三，是准确、鲜明、生动活泼的文风。毛泽东同志主办《湘江评论》，没有老八股，也没有洋八股，它针对着敌人的要害，准确地、猛烈地射击；它对于人民群众的革命斗争和新生事物总是满腔热情地加以引导和支持，像“健学会”这样的学术研究团体的成立，在那些空谈家看来是微不足道的“小事”，而毛泽东同志则采取了热情支持和耐心帮助的态度，《湘江评论》用了很大篇幅来介绍它和评论它。《湘江评论》的文字是生动活泼、丰富多彩的，它有“长蛇生马之文”（例如三期连载的《民众的大联合》一文）；而更多的则是精干有力的短评、杂评和简讯，几十字、几百字、几千字，每字每句都有它的分量，一针见血，针针见血，使人们看了或者怒发冲冠，或者吐气扬眉，或者挺胸而起，或者俯首深思。无论是长文、短文，都尽可能地做到通俗化和形象化，即使不识字的人，也能听得懂。
    所有这些特色，反映了一个共同的本质，这就是刊物的党性、人民性和战斗性。我们一定要继承和发扬《湘江评论》的光荣传统，全党动手，努力办好我们的理论刊物，使它不愧为一个新时代的《湘江评论》。
