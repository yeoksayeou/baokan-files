    The Blood-Stained Banner Fluttering in the Wind
    —Mourning the Martyrs Sacrificed in the Japanese “June 15th” Massacre
    Cheng Guangrui
    The streets of Tokyo are splattered with blood, the blood of Japanese patriotic youth, and the blooming cherry blossoms are broken by the strong wind. Every drop of blood turns into a flame, igniting the anger of millions of people, vowing to defend national independence and dignity! Japan, you were originally the land of the rising sun, your islands like a thousand flowers blooming on the sea. For over two thousand years, Mount Fuji has witnessed the spring of the motherland. But today, your land is shrouded in darkness. American tanks trample your flower-like islands at will, and American planes crash into the white hair on Mount Fuji's head! The new "Security Treaty" is like a new chain, binding the islands of Japan with American missiles, using them as a stake in a new war! Awakened people, how can we endure this utter humiliation? The Japanese nation has reached its most dangerous moment. Raise the fiery red banner and fight! Fight! Look at the raging "tsunami," one wave after another, not a magnitude nine, but a magnitude eighteen… as if the entire ocean suddenly stood up! Wanting to pour out the seawater to wash away the nation's shame, tear up that traitorous treaty, kick over that traitorous government, and not allow American plagues to set foot on Japanese soil! In the struggle, you sacrificed your blood, and the blood sprinkled on the flames, making the flames burn even more fiercely, the strong wind cannot extinguish it, the heavy rain cannot put it out! Your blood is splattered all over the streets, your blood makes the banner even redder, as beautiful as the morning glow, and ten thousand feet of red light will drive away the darkness of suffering! Only struggle, no sorrow, one person falls, ten thousand stand up, one drop of blood falls to the ground, and ten thousand flowers bloom! Look! The blood-stained banner flutters in the wind, and millions of people are stepping on the blood of the martyrs to move forward, to fight for dawn, to welcome a bright tomorrow!

    血染的旗帜迎风招展
    ——悼日本“六·一五”惨案牺牲的烈士
    程光锐东京街头洒遍了鲜血，日本青年爱国者的鲜血，盛开的樱花被狂风吹折。朵朵鲜血化为朵朵火焰，把千万人民的愤怒点燃，誓死保卫民族的独立和尊严！日本啊，你本来是日出的地方，你的岛屿像一千朵鲜花在海上
  开放，两千多年，富士山看尽了祖国
  的春光。可是，今天你的国土上是一片
  黑夜，美国坦克把你如花的岛屿任意
  践踏，美国飞机撞落了富士山头上的
  白发！新“安全条约”像一条新的锁
  链，要把日本的岛屿捆上美国的导
  弹，当作赌注，去投入一次新的大
  战！觉醒的人民，这奇耻大辱怎能
  忍受？日本民族已到了最危险的时
  候，高举起火红的旗帜，战斗！战
  斗！看那滔天的“海啸”一波未平
  一波又起，这不是九级浪，而是十八级…仿佛整个大海突然站立！要倾尽海水洗清民族的耻辱，撕碎那卖国条约，踢翻那卖国
  政府，不准美国瘟神踏上日本的国
  土！在斗争中，你们献出了鲜血，鲜血洒上火焰，火焰燃烧得更
  炽烈，狂风吹不熄，大雨浇不灭！你们的鲜血在街头遍洒，鲜血染得旗帜更鲜红，绚丽似
  朝霞，万丈红光将驱散苦难的黑夜！只有斗争，不要悲哀，一个人倒下去，千万人站起来，一滴血滴下地，千万朵鲜花开！看啊！血染的旗帜迎风招展，千万人民正踏着烈士的血迹向
  前，去为黎明战斗，去迎接灿烂的
  明天！
