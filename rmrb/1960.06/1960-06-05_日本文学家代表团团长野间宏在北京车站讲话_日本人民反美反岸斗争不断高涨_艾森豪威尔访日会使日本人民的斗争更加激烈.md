Xinhua News Agency, 4th: The Japanese literary delegation headed by Noma Hiroshi, who was invited to visit our country, arrived in Beijing by train at noon today and was warmly welcomed by the cultural circles of the capital.

As the train slowly entered the station, a burst of warm applause erupted from the welcoming crowd. Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Asian-African Solidarity, Mao Dun, Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and others warmly shook hands and greeted friends such as Noma Hiroshi, Kamei Katsuichiro, and Matsuoka Yoko, who stepped off the train. Literary and art figures from the capital presented flowers to the Japanese friends.

Also at the station to welcome the delegation were well-known figures from our cultural circles, including Yang Hansheng, Lao She, Shao Quanlin, Zhou Erfu, Xie Bingxin, Zhang Geng, Ma Shaobo, Yuan Xuefen, Chen Bohua, and Yang Shuying.

Japanese peace activist Kinkazu Saionji and his wife, and Korean peace activist Hwang Bong-koo, also welcomed the delegation at the station today.

Noma Hiroshi spoke amidst warm applause. The full text of his speech is as follows:

Chinese comrades, distinguished members of the Beijing cultural community:

We, the Japanese visiting Chinese literary delegation, express our deep gratitude for the warm welcome extended to us.

Our Japanese literary delegation would first like to express our deep gratitude to the China People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the Chinese Writers Association for inviting us to visit China at this particular moment. The moment we speak of is a time when the Japanese people's struggle against the new Security Treaty is raging fiercely. This visit to China will allow us to report in detail on the increasingly diligent and rising struggle of the Japanese people against the Security Treaty. Moreover, in China, we can join with Chinese comrades to carry out this struggle, further increasing its strength. The Kishi government, at a Diet session before dawn on May 20th, disregarding the petition of 13 million people against the Security Treaty, relied on conspiracy and violence to pass the new Security Treaty in the House of Representatives, attempting to complete the procedures for ratifying the treaty before the visit of US President Eisenhower to Japan on June 19th. Faced with this changed and extraordinary situation, the Japanese cultural community, academia, workers, citizens, farmers, and the entire Japanese people have risen up. Confronted with this crisis of democracy and peace, we have come to China with the support of the struggle against the Security Treaty (a struggle that has developed into an unprecedentedly large-scale struggle in Japanese history). We want to convey to our Chinese friends the breath and strength of this struggle, to convey the pulse that is beating ever more fiercely in the Japanese people's struggle against US imperialism and the Kishi government. Moreover, we want to draw immense strength for this struggle from China.

We had always thought that we must visit China no matter what. This is because we believe that this struggle against the US-Japan military alliance is a struggle to defend the common foundation for the development of Japan, China, and other Asian countries – democracy, peace, and independence. This is due to the reflection that the large-scale wars of the past caused great suffering to Asian countries, especially to the Chinese people. This reflection has turned into an increasingly strong emotion in the nationwide struggle against the new Security Treaty, generating action against US imperialism and Japanese militarism (which no Japanese person fears).

Eisenhower insists on visiting Japan, disregarding the Japanese people's request that he postpone his visit. However, the struggle of the Japanese people will definitely intensify as a result. Today – June 4th – is the most intense day of the seventeenth unified action against the new Security Treaty, centered on the general strike of the working class in Japan. At this moment, we have arrived at our destination for visiting China – the capital of the People's Republic of China, Beijing. There is a reason for this. We are participating in this seventeenth unified action against the new Security Treaty in Beijing. I would like to tell everyone during this unified action that the Japanese people sincerely thank the Chinese people for their strong support of the Japanese people's struggle.

Our Japanese literary delegation hopes that this visit to China will yield many fruitful results. We would like to exchange experiences with Chinese writers on literary matters, hold talks on the foundations of literature that oppose war and strive for national independence, and clarify the path to promote national culture and revive the long-standing civilizations of Asia and Africa. We would like to strive to promote the solidarity of Japanese and Chinese writers and the cooperation between the Japanese and Chinese people through this visit.

In Beijing, the Heroes' Conference of the Cultural and Educational Front is currently being held grandly, pushing the cultural revolution to its climax. We have come to Beijing at this time. We are very concerned about this conference and express our great respect. We hope that this conference will be a success, and we want to learn many things from it and take what we have learned back to Japan.

    日本文学家代表团团长野间宏在北京车站讲话
    日本人民反美反岸斗争不断高涨
    艾森豪威尔访日会使日本人民的斗争更加激烈
    据新华社4日讯　应邀来我国访问的以野间宏为首的日本文学家代表团，今天中午乘火车到达北京，受到首都文化界的热烈欢迎。
    当火车徐徐进站时，欢迎的人群响起了一片热烈的掌声。中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志、中国作家协会主席茅盾、中国人民对外文化协会会长楚图南等同走下火车的野间宏、龟井胜一郎、松冈洋子等朋友亲切地握手问好。首都文艺界人士向日本朋友们献了鲜花。
    到车站欢迎的还有我国文化界著名人士阳翰笙、老舍、邵荃麟、周而复、谢冰心、张庚、马少波、袁雪芬、陈伯华和杨淑英等。
    在北京的日本和平人士西园寺公一和夫人、朝鲜和平人士黄凤九今天也到车站欢迎。
    野间宏在热烈欢迎的掌声中讲话。他的讲话全文如下：
    中国的同志们，北京文化界的各位先生：
    我们日本访华文学家代表团受到这么多的人的欢迎，深深表示感谢。
    我们日本文学家代表团首先向在目前这个时期邀请我们来中国访问的中国人民对外文化协会和中国作家协会深深表示感谢。我们所说的目前这个时期，是日本人民反对新安全条约的斗争正在猛烈进行着的这个时期。我们这次访问中国，可以详尽地报告日本人民的日益努力进行、正在高涨着的反对安全条约斗争，而且可以在中国，同中国的同志们一道，进行这个斗争，进一步增加这个斗争的力量。岸政府在5月20日黎明以前的国会会议上，不顾一千三百万人签名请愿、反对安全条约的情况，依靠阴谋和暴力，在众议院通过新安全条约，想要在美国总统艾森豪威尔访问日本的6月19日以前完成批准这个条约的手续。碰到这个发生了变化的非常事态，日本文化界、学界、工人、市民、农民、日本全国人民站起来了。我们面临这个民主和和平的危机，受到反对安全条约斗争（这场斗争已经发展成为日本历史上空前大规模的斗争）的支持，到中国来了。我们想把这个斗争的气息和力量，想把逐时逐刻更加激烈地跳动起来的、日本人民反对美帝国主义和岸政府的斗争中跳动着的脉搏告知中国的各位。而且，我们想从中国汲取进行这个斗争的巨大力量。
    我们曾经想到，无论如何也要访问中国。这是因为，我们认为，这个反对日美军事同盟的斗争是保卫日本、中国、亚洲各国求发展的共同基础——民主、和平和独立的斗争。这是因为出于这样的反省：由于过去进行的大规模战争，给亚洲各国，尤其是给中国人民造成了很大的痛苦。这种反省，在席卷全国的反对新安全条约的斗争中变成越来越强烈的情绪，产生了反对美帝国主义和日本军国主义（任何一个日本人都不怕它们）的行动。
    艾森豪威尔不顾日本人民要他延期访问日本的要求，硬要访问日本。但是，日本人民的斗争一定会因此而更加激烈。今天——6月4日，在日本，是以工人阶级总罢工为中心的反对新安全条约第十七次统一行动展开得最激烈的一天。在这个时候，我们到达了我们访问中国的目的地——中华人民共和国的首都北京。这是有理由的。我们正在北京参加着这次反对新安全条约第十七次统一行动。我就在这次统一行动当中告诉各位：日本人民衷心感谢中国人民对日本人民斗争的大力支援。
    我们日本文学家代表团期望这次访华之行取得很多的成果。我们想同中国的文学家就文学方面进行经验交流，就反对战争、争取民族独立的文学的基础进行会谈，并且想弄清楚发扬民族文化、复兴亚洲和非洲历史悠久的文明的道路。我们想通过这次访问努力促进日本文学家和中国文学家的团结，促进日本人民和中国人民的合作。
    在北京，目前正在盛大地召开文教战线群英大会，要把文化革命推向最高潮。我们正在这个时候来到北京。我们对这次大会非常关心并且表示很大的敬意。我们希望这次大会获得成功，同时想从那里学习许多东西并且把学到的东西带回日本去。（附图片）
