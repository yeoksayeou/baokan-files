Premier Zhou Discusses the Excellent Current Domestic and International Situation
U.S. Imperialism and its running dogs are trapped in the encirclement of the world's people, the noose around their necks tightening. Our people, holding high the three red flags, with several movements promoting each other, have formed an excellent situation of an all-round Great Leap Forward.
Xinhua News Agency, 5th - Premier Zhou Enlai held a grand banquet in the banquet hall of the Great Hall of the People this evening to entertain all the representatives attending the National Congress of Cultural and Educational Heroes and to congratulate them on the brilliant achievements they have made on all fronts of culture and education.
Party and state leaders Zhu De, Deng Xiaoping, Peng Zhen, Li Xiannian, Lu Dingyi, Bo Yibo, Shen Junru, He Xiangning, Lin Feng, Xie Juezai and Vice Chairmen of the National Defense Council Zhang Zhizhong and Fu Zuoyi attended today's banquet. When they entered the banquet hall, all the representatives stood up and applauded warmly for a long time.
At half past six, the banquet began, and Premier Zhou Enlai spoke. He extended warm congratulations on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council to the heroes from all walks of life on the cultural and educational front. At this time, thunderous applause like spring thunder resounded in the banquet hall for a long time.
Premier Zhou Enlai then said: This conference is being held under the excellent domestic and international situation and under the unprecedented prosperity of our cultural and educational undertakings.
Premier Zhou said that the current international situation is extremely favorable for the struggle for world peace, national independence, democratic freedom, and socialism. The crimes of U.S. imperialism in invading Soviet airspace and sabotaging the Four-Power Summit have made the people of the world more aware of the essence of U.S. imperialism and strengthened their determination to fight against U.S. imperialist aggression and war policies. The Soviet Union's just struggle against aggression and in defense of peace has been supported by peace-loving and justice-upholding people all over the world. Premier Zhou pointed out that in order to encircle the socialist camp and prepare for a new world war, U.S. imperialism has filled the world with military bases. These military bases not only risk bringing the disaster of war to the local people, but also subject them to U.S. suppression and plunder. Therefore, the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are constantly launching storms of struggle against imperialism, primarily against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. Premier Zhou said that Syngman Rhee has fallen, Menderes has fallen, and Nobusuke Kishi is also tottering. U.S. imperialism and its running dogs have been trapped in the encirclement of the people of the world, and the noose around their necks is tightening. The united front of the world against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs is forming and expanding. As Chairman Mao said: "The days of the imperialists are numbered. They have done all sorts of bad things, and the oppressed people of the world will never forgive them."
Premier Zhou then said that the current domestic situation is very good. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country are holding high the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and are continuing to leap forward on all fronts. Premier Zhou said that while vigorously promoting industrial and agricultural production, the whole country is vigorously running urban people's communes, vigorously carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution, and vigorously promoting cultural revolution. Several movements coordinate and promote each other, forming an excellent situation of a comprehensive leap forward in our socialist construction.
Premier Zhou said that the situation on our cultural and educational front is also very good. In the past ten years, especially since the Great Leap Forward of 1958, we have made tremendous achievements in culture and education. The cultural backwardness caused by the long-term exploitation and oppression of imperialism and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang is rapidly changing. The ranks of the proletarian intellectuals have begun to form and are expanding. A high tide of ideological remolding centered on studying Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works and a cultural revolution centered on eliminating illiteracy and educational revolution has arrived.
Premier Zhou then said that the domestic and international situation is very favorable to our socialist revolution and construction. Cultural and educational work is an important aspect of socialist revolution and construction. All comrades working on the cultural and educational front must, together with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, continue to break superstitions, emancipate our minds, go all out, aim high, resolutely implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, resolutely carry the educational revolution to the end, and push the cultural revolution to a new climax, in order to rapidly change our country's poor and blank state, to rapidly build our country into a great socialist power, and to fight unremittingly for the future realization of our communist ideal.
Premier Zhou Enlai finally proposed: To celebrate the brilliant achievements of the national cultural and educational cause and the arrival of the cultural revolution climax, to celebrate the development and growth of the national cultural and educational team, to celebrate the continuous leap forward of all fronts of our socialist construction, to celebrate the health of all the advanced cultural and educational workers representatives present here from all regions, all nationalities, and all aspects of the motherland, and to celebrate the health of Chairman Mao, the great leader of the people of all nationalities of the country, cheers!
Premier Zhou Enlai's speech aroused bursts of applause from the representatives. They stood up from their seats for a long time and responded to the Party's call with the most enthusiastic applause.
The magnificent banquet hall was brightly lit and filled with joy tonight. Flowers were blooming on the rostrum, and more than 6,000 representatives smiled. They drank and talked with the Party and state leaders with infinite excitement.
Minister of Education Yang Xiufeng toasted on behalf of the cultural and educational departments of the State Council. Yang Xiufeng said that the leadership of the Party and the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought are the fundamental guarantee for the victory of all our work. In order to push the cultural revolution to a new climax, we must sincerely obey the leadership of the Party, earnestly study Chairman Mao's works, hold higher the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, unite more closely, constantly transform and improve ourselves, always be the promoters of cultural revolution and ideological revolution, and develop cultural and educational undertakings in a faster, better, and more economical way, so as to realize the great task of intellectualizing workers and peasants and laborizing intellectuals.
During the banquet, representatives from the central organs and delegations from various provinces, cities, and the People's Liberation Army toasted the Party and state leaders. They expressed their infinite gratitude for the care of the Party and state leaders for them, and unanimously stated that they would resolutely implement the spirit of the conference, conscientiously promote advanced experience, hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, and push the cultural revolution to a new climax.
At the end of the banquet, Chairman Zhu De once again congratulated the representatives and toasted for the health of the representatives. The banquet hall once again resounded with long and enthusiastic applause. (Attached picture)

    在招待全国文教群英大会代表的盛大宴会上
    周总理谈当前国内外大好形势
    美帝国主义及其走狗已陷于世界人民包围中，套在脖子上的绞索越抽越紧我国人民高举三面红旗，几个运动互相促进，形成全面大跃进的大好局面
    新华社5日讯　周恩来总理今天晚上在人民大会堂宴会厅举行盛大宴会，招待出席全国文教群英会的全体代表，祝贺他们在文教各条战线上取得的辉煌成就。
    党和国家领导人朱德、邓小平、彭真、李先念、陆定一、薄一波、沈钧儒、何香凝、林枫、谢觉哉和国防委员会副主席张治中、傅作义等出席了今天的宴会，当他们步入宴会厅时，全体代表起立，长时间的热烈鼓掌。
    六时半，宴会开始，周恩来总理首先讲话。他代表中共中央和国务院，向在座的文教战线各路英雄致热烈祝贺。这时，宴会厅里响起了经久不息的春雷般的掌声。
    周恩来总理接着说：这次大会是在国内外的大好形势下召开的，是在我国文化教育事业空前繁荣的大好形势下召开的。
    周总理说，当前的国际形势，对于争取世界和平、民族独立、民主自由和社会主义的斗争空前有利。美帝国主义侵犯苏联领空、破坏四国政府首脑会议的罪行，使全世界人民更加看清楚了美帝国主义的本质，更加增强了反对美帝国主义侵略和战争政策的斗争的决心。苏联反对侵略、保卫和平的正义斗争得到了全世界爱好和平主张正义的人民的支持。周总理指出，美帝国主义为了包围社会主义阵营，为了准备发动新的世界大战，在世界各地布满了军事基地。这些军事基地不仅有可能为当地人民带来战争的灾难，而且首先使他们遭到美国的镇压和掠夺。因此，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民，不断掀起反对帝国主义，首先是反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争风暴。周总理说，李承晚垮台了，曼德列斯垮台了，岸信介也摇摇欲坠。美帝国主义及其走狗已经陷于世界人民的包围之中，套在他们脖子上的绞索越抽越紧，世界上反对美帝国主义及其走狗的统一战线正在形成和扩大。正像毛主席所说的：“帝国主义的寿命不会很长了，他们做尽了坏事，全世界受压迫的人民决不会饶恕他们。”
    周总理接着说，当前的国内形势好得很。在党和毛主席的领导下，全国人民正高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，在各个战线上继续大跃进。周总理说，在工农业生产大跃进的同时，全国正大办城市人民公社，大搞技术革新和技术革命，大闹文化革命。几个运动互相配合，互相促进，形成了我国社会主义建设事业全面大跃进的大好局面。
    周总理说，我国文教战线的形势也好得很。十年来，特别是1958年大跃进以来，我们在文化教育方面，已经取得了巨大成就。帝国主义和国民党反动统治长期剥削和压迫所造成的文化落后状态，正在迅速改变。无产阶级知识分子队伍已经开始形成并且正在扩大。以学习马克思列宁主义和毛主席著作为中心的思想改造运动和以扫除文盲、教育革命为中心的文化革命高潮已经到来。
    周总理接着说，国内外的形势，对我们的社会主义革命和建设事业十分有利。文化教育工作，是社会主义革命和建设的一个重要方面。在文化教育战线上工作的所有同志，必须同全国人民一道，在党和毛主席的领导下，继续破除迷信，解放思想，鼓足干劲，力争上游，坚决贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，坚决把教育革命进行到底，把文化革命推向一个新的高潮，为迅速改变我国一穷二白的面貌，为迅速把我国建成伟大的社会主义强国，为将来实现我们共产主义的最高理想，进行坚持不懈的斗争。
    周恩来总理最后提议：为祝贺全国文化教育事业的光辉成就和文化革命高潮的到来，为祝贺全国文化教育队伍的发展壮大，为祝贺我国社会主义建设事业各个战线的持续跃进，为祝贺在座的、来自祖国各个地区、各个民族、各个方面的全体文教先进工作者代表的健康，为全国各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席的健康，干杯！
    周恩来总理的讲话，激起了代表们的一阵又一阵的掌声。他们从座位上长时间地站立起来，用最热烈的掌声来表示响应党的号召。
    瑰丽的宴会厅，今晚灯光灿烂，一片喜气洋洋。主席台上鲜花竞放，六千多代表笑逐颜开，他们以无限激动的心情同党和国家的领导人饮酒畅谈。
    教育部长杨秀峰代表国务院文教各部门敬酒致词。杨秀峰说，党的领导和毛泽东思想红旗，是我们一切工作获得胜利的根本保证。为了把文化革命推向一个新的高潮，我们一定要诚心诚意地服从党的领导，认真学习毛主席著作，更高地举起毛泽东思想红旗，更加紧密地团结起来，不断改造和提高自己，永远作文化革命、思想革命的促进派，多快好省地发展文教事业，实现工农群众知识化，知识分子劳动化的伟大任务。
    宴会进行中，中央机关、各省、市和解放军代表团的代表，分别向党和国家的领导人敬酒。他们对于党和国家领导人对他们的关怀表示无限感激，并且一致表示要坚决贯彻大会精神，认真推广先进经验，高举毛泽东思想红旗，把文化革命推向新的高潮。
    宴会结束时，朱德委员长再次向代表们祝贺，并为代表们的身体健康干杯，宴会厅里又一次响起了经久不息的热烈掌声。（附图片）
