    Hold High the Marxist-Leninist Revolutionary Banner of the Moscow Declaration
    The representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries attending the Third Congress of the Romanian Workers' Party held talks in Bucharest and issued a press communique. The communique stated: "The participants in the meeting unanimously affirmed that the international situation and the entire course of development of the socialist world system fully confirmed the correctness of the Marxist-Leninist arguments in the two declarations adopted by the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries in Moscow in November 1957." The communique also stated, "The participants in the meeting affirmed their loyalty to the principles of the two declarations and considered the two declarations to be the charters of the modern communist movement and the workers' movement and their programs for peace, democracy and socialism."
    We believe that in the current situation, it is necessary and of great significance for the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries to reaffirm the correctness of the 1957 Moscow Declaration.
    The 1957 Moscow Declaration was formulated based on the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism and the new characteristics of our time. The declaration analyzes the two world systems of socialism and capitalism, analyzes the current situation of imperialism, analyzes the issues of war and peace, analyzes how to strive for world peace, analyzes that the basis of the foreign policy of socialist countries is the peaceful coexistence of countries with two different social systems, analyzes the common laws of socialist revolution and socialist construction, analyzes the different forms of peaceful or non-peaceful transition for capitalist countries to realize socialist revolution, analyzes the national liberation movements of colonies and semi-colonies, analyzes the mutual relations and solidarity and cooperation between socialist countries and between the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries in the world. These analyses are not only completely suitable for the current situation, but also the guidelines for the future struggles of the people of all countries in the world.
    Since the publication of the Moscow Declaration, the socialist construction and socialist transformation of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union have achieved greater and greater victories in the past two years. The strength of the socialist camp is developing vigorously. The socialist camp is playing an increasingly important role in international life. In the past two years, the struggle of the people of all countries in the world against imperialism has been continuously developing and has now entered a new stage of upsurge. The struggle for national independence, democratic freedom, and world peace is sweeping through Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The struggle against monopoly capital and against the bellicose groups of imperialism, carried out by the masses of the people headed by the working class, is shaking the heart of the capitalist world - North America and Western Europe.
    In the past two years, the imperialist group headed by the United States has become increasingly mired in difficulties, and their internal contradictions are constantly increasing. American imperialism is increasingly isolated among the people of the world. The general crisis of capitalism is becoming increasingly profound, and the relative stability of capitalism is no longer possible.
    In short, the development of the world situation is constantly proving with new facts the assertion made in the Moscow Declaration: "The development of socialism and the national liberation movement has dramatically accelerated the process of the collapse of imperialism"; "Socialism is developing upward, while imperialism is declining."
    The characteristic of the current situation is that the East wind continues to prevail over the West wind, the socialist forces surpass the imperialist forces, and the peace forces surpass the war forces. Under this situation, the possibility of preventing imperialism from launching a new world war exists and is growing. However, imperialism is imperialism after all. The monopoly bourgeoisie is the monopoly bourgeoisie after all. The imperialists will never automatically abandon their policies of aggression and war, nor will they automatically withdraw from the stage of history because of their difficult situation. The closer they get to death, the more frantically they will struggle.
    The Moscow Declaration exposed the aggressive and plundering nature of imperialism, pointing out the danger of war caused by the existence of imperialism. The declaration pointed out that "the imperialist aggressive group of the United States is trying to rely on the so-called 'position of strength' policy to rule most countries in the world and is trying to hinder mankind from advancing according to the laws of social development." American imperialists "have become the center of reactionary forces in the world and the most ferocious enemies of the masses of the people."
    For the past two years, the imperialist group headed by the United States has persisted in the cold war situation and international tensions they have created. American imperialism is intensifying its arms expansion and war preparations, strengthening its overseas military bases, piecing together aggressive military blocs, vigorously supporting the militaristic forces of West Germany and Japan, plotting wars against the socialist camp, infringing upon the independence and sovereignty of many countries, and interfering with and suppressing the national independence movements and people's revolutionary movements of various countries. Not long ago, the US government sent spy planes to invade Soviet airspace, brazenly sabotaging the long-planned four-power government summit. The American imperialist chieftain Eisenhower, in his plundering trip to the Far East, spread the seeds of war everywhere, attempting to maintain and strengthen the American aggressive front in Asia.
    All of this is not accidental, but is caused by the nature of imperialism. The monopoly capital forces in the imperialist countries headed by the United States have become more concentrated after the Second World War. Their plunder of their own people and the people of colonies, semi-colonies, and dependencies has become more brutal. They are taking various measures to expand capital exports and extract high profits. And American imperialism is frantically and cunningly controlling and plundering many countries in the capitalist world through the form of so-called "US aid." In order to achieve their plundering goals and to eliminate obstacles to achieving this goal, the imperialists headed by the United States stubbornly adhere to their policies of aggression and war.
    The Moscow Declaration said: "As long as imperialism exists, there will be soil for aggressive wars." Countless facts prove that this assertion is completely correct. The Moscow Declaration pointed this out, certainly not to make people lose confidence in defending world peace, on the contrary, it is precisely to arouse "the people of all countries in the world must maintain the greatest vigilance against the danger of war caused by imperialism," so that the people of all countries can more effectively fight to defend world peace.
    The Moscow Declaration emphasized that "at present, the struggle for peace and for peaceful coexistence has become the demand of the broadest masses of people in all countries in the world. The Communist Parties of all countries consider the struggle for peace to be their primary task. They will work together with all peace-loving forces and do everything possible to prevent war."
    The socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union have always adhered to a peaceful foreign policy, advocating peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, striving to resolve international disputes through negotiations, and making unremitting efforts to ease international tensions. As early as 1954, our country jointly initiated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence with India and Burma, and at the Bandung Conference in 1955, we jointly formulated the Ten Principles of Peaceful Coexistence with Asian and African countries. For many years, we have been handling our relations with our friendly neighboring countries in Southeast Asia and other countries in accordance with these principles, and we have achieved remarkable results. This year, our country signed treaties of friendship and peaceful coexistence with Burma and Nepal respectively. In order to strive to solve major international issues, the Soviet Union has been working for several years to promote the four-power government summit. This effort, like the Soviet Union's disarmament proposals and other propositions to ease international tensions, has consistently been supported by China and other socialist countries. After the four-power government summit was sabotaged by the United states, the Soviet Union and other socialist countries still did not give up the path of peaceful negotiations. All these facts prove that the obstacle to achieving peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems lies not on the side of socialist countries, but on the side of imperialist countries headed by the United States.
    Experience has shown that imperialists are always unwilling to conduct serious negotiations with socialist countries unless they have no other choice. Imperialists often tear up or sabotage agreements that have been reached in negotiations. For example, the Potsdam Agreement signed at the end of World War II could not be fully implemented due to the perfidy of the imperialists headed by the United States. The Korean Armistice Agreement and the Indochina Armistice Agreement have also been partially undermined by American imperialism in their implementation.
    In order to make it impossible for imperialists to disagree with negotiations, in order to make negotiations effective, it is necessary to continuously strengthen the strength of socialist countries and continuously strengthen the struggle of the people of all countries in the world against the imperialist policies of aggression and war. If an agreement is reached in negotiations, to prevent the agreement from being sabotaged, it must also rely on the unremitting efforts of socialist countries and the people of all countries in the world. In no case should imperialism be trusted lightly.
    The Moscow Declaration emphasized that the united struggle of powerful anti-imperialist forces is necessary to defend world peace. The declaration said: "The powerful forces of the present era that safeguard the cause of peace are: the indestructible socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union; the peace-loving countries of Asia and Africa that stand on the anti-imperialist position and together with the socialist countries constitute a vast area of peace; the international working class, first of all its vanguard - the Communist Party; the liberation movement of the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries; the mass movement of the people of all countries in the world for peace. The people of European countries who have declared neutrality, the people of Latin America, and the masses of people in imperialist countries are also firmly opposed to the planning of a new war. The union of these powerful forces can prevent the outbreak of war. If the imperialist war maniacs insist on launching a war at all costs, then imperialism is doomed to destruction, because the people will never continue to tolerate the system that has brought them such great pain and sacrifice."
    For the past two years, the united struggle of these powerful anti-imperialist forces has been continuously thwarting and continuing to thwarting the aggressive policies and war policies of imperialism headed by the United States. The Moscow Declaration pointed out: "At present, the forces of peace have grown greatly, and it is practically possible to prevent war." The imperialist bellicose groups and their running dogs in various countries are only a small handful of people in the world. The workers, peasants, and most of the intellectuals in various countries, the national bourgeoisie of oppressed nations, and the peace-loving people in capitalist countries are all victims of the imperialist war policy, and they all stand or can stand on the side of defending world peace and opposing imperialism, and they account for the vast majority of mankind. Revolutionary people account for more than ninety percent. Everyone see, will the result of the struggle fall into the hands of the revolutionary people who account for more than ninety percent? Or will it fall into the hands of the imperialists and reactionaries of various countries who account for less than ten percent? Please see today's world, whose world is it after all?
    The main task of the people of all countries in the world now is to form the broadest united front against imperialism headed by the United States and resolutely fight against the aggressive policies and war policies of American imperialism. The people of all countries are striving to achieve disarmament, eliminate overseas military bases, ban nuclear weapons, establish collective security in Europe and Asia, and achieve independence for all colonies, in order to stop imperialist wars and defend world peace. The more widely the people of all countries in the world unite into this united front against imperialism headed by the United States and carry out a common struggle, the more guaranteed world peace will be. However, as mentioned above, as long as imperialism exists, there must be no unrealistic peace illusions, and the danger of imperialism launching a war must not be relaxed. Only when the imperialist system and the capitalist system are eliminated on earth, and when classes are truly eliminated, will there truly be permanent world peace.
    No matter how frantically imperialism headed by the United States expands its arms and prepares for war, and conducts a dying struggle, it will not be able to escape its ultimate fate of destruction. The declaration said well: "The policies pursued by these anti-people imperialist aggressive forces are self-defeating, creating the gravediggers who will bury themselves." The imperialist system will eventually be overthrown by the people of all countries, and the capitalist system will eventually be replaced by the socialist system. This is the objective law of social development, and it is independent of the subjective will of any class, any group, any political party, and any individual.
    The Moscow Declaration discussed the issue of the different forms of transition from capitalism to socialism, believing that in some capitalist countries, the working class, headed by its advanced ranks, must, according to specific possibilities, "prepare the necessary conditions for the peaceful realization of the socialist revolution." However, "under the conditions that the exploiting classes use violence against the people, another possibility must be considered, that is, the non-peaceful transition to socialism."
    The working class and the working people certainly want to seize power and transition to socialism in a peaceful way. It would be wrong not to use this possibility if it exists. However, the ruling class will never give up power automatically, and will always carry out violent suppression when the people rise up to carry out revolution. Therefore, the working class and its political party must never build all their work on the possibility of a peaceful transition, but must at the same time prepare for two possibilities, namely the possibility of a peaceful transition and the possibility of a non-peaceful transition. It is completely wrong to groundlessly say that peaceful transition is the only possibility.
    The Moscow Declaration emphasized that "revisionism and dogmatism must be resolutely overcome in the ranks of the Communist Party and the Workers' Party." At the same time, the declaration believes that "under the current conditions, the main danger is revisionism, or right-wing opportunism." The declaration pointed out: "The existence of bourgeois influence is the domestic root of revisionism. Succumbing to the pressure of imperialism is the foreign root of revisionism."
    The Moscow Declaration said: "Modern revisionism attempts to slander the great doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, saying that it is 'outdated' and that it seems to have lost its significance for social development at present. Revisionists try to corrode the revolutionary soul of Marxism and undermine the confidence of the working class and the working people in socialism. They deny the historical necessity of the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat in the period of transition from capitalism to socialism, deny the leading role of the Marxist-Leninist party, deny the principles of proletarian internationalism, demand the abandonment of the basic principles of Leninism on party building, first of all the abandonment of democratic centralism, and demand that the Communist Party be transformed from a fighting revolutionary organization into some kind of club where arguments are never settled."
    These arguments of the Moscow Declaration on modern revisionism have increasingly shown their correctness and importance in the development of the international communist movement in the past two years. All Marxist-Leninists must adhere to the struggle against modern revisionism. Of course, dogmatism must be opposed. Dogmatism is divorced from the masses and divorced from reality. Without opposing dogmatism, it is impossible to guide our cause to victory. However, we must never abandon the basic theoretical position of Marxism-Leninism under the pretext of opposing dogmatism, and revisionism must never be allowed to replace Marxism-Leninism.
    The Moscow Declaration said: "In order to effectively unite the working class, unite all working people and progressive mankind, and unite the forces of freedom and peace in the world, it is necessary first of all to strengthen the unity of the Communist Parties and the Workers' Parties themselves, and to strengthen the unity between the Communist Parties and the Workers' Parties of all countries. This unity is the core of all broader unity and the most fundamental guarantee for the victory of the cause of the working class."
    The unity of the international proletariat, the unity of the Communist Parties and the Workers' Parties of all countries, the unity of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union, and the unity of the two countries and the two parties of China and the Soviet Union are based on Marxism-Leninism and on the basis of the Moscow Declaration. This unity is unbreakable and can stand the test. The provocation of any socialist country by imperialist countries is a provocation against all socialist countries. The socialist countries resolutely support the solemn position of Comrade Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, at the preparatory meeting of the four-power government summit in Paris, which once again demonstrated the great unity of the socialist camp. It is futile for the imperialists and modern revisionists to sow discord and attempt to undermine our unity, and their purpose will never be achieved.
    The current world situation is very good. The enemy is rotting day by day, and we are getting better day by day. The aggressive policies and war policies of imperialism headed by the United States are arousing increasingly strong resistance from the masses of the people all over the world. The national democratic revolutionary struggles of the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries, the heroic struggle of the Japanese people against American imperialism and its running dogs, the heroic struggle of the Cuban people against American imperialism, the struggle of the Algerian people against colonialism and for independence, as well as the struggles of the people of South Korea and the people of Turkey, all these struggles are heavy blows to the imperialists headed by the United States, and have played a great role in defending world peace. These struggles have been supported by the people of all countries in the world, supported by the proletariat of the world, supported by the entire socialist camp, and supported by people of all countries who love peace and uphold justice.
    We believe that with the development of the struggle of the people of all countries to defend world peace and oppose imperialism, with the development of the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries, with the development of the international communist movement, and with the development of Marxism-Leninism, the international unity of the proletariat will surely be continuously consolidated and continuously developed. As the press communique of the socialist countries' Communist and Workers' Parties attending the Third Congress of the Romanian Workers' Party stated: "The Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries will continue to strengthen the unity of the socialist countries of the world system in the future, and will cherish their unity in the struggle of the people of the world for peace, security, and the victory of the great cause of Marxism-Leninism as they cherish the pupils of their eyes."
    Let us hold high the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary banner of the Moscow Declaration and march forward courageously!

    高举莫斯科宣言的马克思列宁主义革命旗帜
    出席罗马尼亚工人党第三次代表大会的社会主义国家共产党和工人党的代表，在布加勒斯特举行了会谈，并发布了会谈公报。这个公报说：“会议参加者一致确认，国际事态和世界社会主义体系各国发展的整个进程，完全证实了各国共产党和工人党于一九五七年十一月在莫斯科通过的两个宣言的各个马克思列宁主义论点的正确性。”公报又说，“会议参加者确认自己忠实于两个宣言的各项原则，认为两个宣言是现代共产主义运动和工人运动的宪章，是它们争取和平、民主和社会主义的纲领。”
    我们认为，在目前形势下，社会主义各国共产党和工人党重申一九五七年的莫斯科宣言的正确性，是必要的，是有重大意义的。
    一九五七年的莫斯科宣言是根据马克思列宁主义的基本原理和我们时代的新特点而制定的。宣言中对于社会主义和资本主义两个世界体系的分析，对于现代帝国主义情况的分析，对于战争与和平问题的分析，对于如何争取世界和平问题的分析，对于社会主义国家对外政策的基础是两种不同社会制度国家的和平共处问题的分析，对于社会主义革命和社会主义建设的共同规律的分析，对于资本主义各国实现社会主义革命是通过和平过渡还是通过非和平过渡的不同形式问题的分析，对于殖民地半殖民地的民族解放运动问题的分析，对于社会主义各国之间和世界各国共产党、工人党之间的相互关系和团结合作问题的分析，这些分析不但完全适合于目前的情况，而且是今后世界各国人民斗争的指针。
    自从莫斯科宣言发表以后，两年多来，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的社会主义建设和社会主义改造取得了越来越大的胜利。社会主义阵营的力量正在蓬蓬勃勃地发展。社会主义阵营在国际生活中起着越来越大的作用。这两年多来，世界各国人民反对帝国主义的斗争不断地向前发展，现在已经进入了一个新高涨的阶段。争取民族独立、民主自由、世界和平的斗争，正在席卷亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲。以工人阶级为首的人民群众所进行的反对垄断资本、反对帝国主义好战集团的斗争，震动着资本主义世界的心脏——北美和西欧。
    这两年多来，以美国为首的帝国主义集团越来越陷入重重的困难，他们的内部矛盾正在不断增长。美帝国主义在世界人民中越来越陷入孤立。资本主义总危机越来越深刻化，资本主义的相对稳定早已不可能再次出现。
    总之，世界局势的发展正在不断地以新的事实来证明莫斯科宣言所提出的论断：“社会主义和民族解放运动的发展剧烈地加速了帝国主义的没落过程”；“社会主义在向上发展，而帝国主义却在衰退”。
    目前形势的特点是东风继续压倒西风，社会主义力量超过帝国主义力量，和平力量超过战争力量。在这种形势下，制止帝国主义发动新的世界大战的可能性是存在的，而且是日益增长的。但是，帝国主义终究是帝国主义。垄断资产阶级终究是垄断资产阶级。帝国主义者决不会因为处境困难而自动放弃他们的侵略政策和战争政策，自动退出历史舞台。他们越是接近死亡，就越是要进行疯狂的挣扎。
    莫斯科宣言揭露了帝国主义侵略的、掠夺的本性，指出了由于帝国主义的存在而造成的战争的危险。宣言指出，“美国的帝国主义侵略集团，力图依靠所谓‘实力地位’政策统治世界上的大多数国家，并且企图阻挠人类按照社会发展规律前进。”美帝国主义者“成为全世界反动势力的中心，成为人民群众的最凶恶的敌人”。
    两年多来，以美国为首的帝国主义集团一直坚持它们所造成的冷战局面和国际紧张局势。美帝国主义正在变本加厉地进行扩军备战，加强它的国外军事基地，拼凑侵略性的军事集团，大力扶植西德和日本的军国主义势力，策划对社会主义阵营的战争，侵犯许多国家的独立和主权，干涉和镇压各国民族独立运动和人民革命运动。不久以前，美国政府派遣间谍飞机，侵犯苏联领空，悍然破坏了酝酿已久的四国政府首脑会议。美帝国主义头子艾森豪威尔在他的远东的强盗旅行中，到处撒播战争的种子，企图维持和加强美国在亚洲的侵略阵线。
    所有这一切，都不是偶然的事情，而是由帝国主义的本性所产生的。以美国为首的帝国主义国家内的垄断资本势力，在第二次世界大战后更加集中了。它们对于本国人民和殖民地、半殖民地、附属国人民的掠夺更加残酷了。它们采取各种办法扩大资本输出，榨取高额利润。而美帝国主义还疯狂地同时也更狡猾地通过所谓“美援”的形式，控制和掠夺资本主义世界的许多国家。为了实现他们的掠夺的目的，并且为了排除实现这个目的的障碍，以美国为首的帝国主义者顽固地坚持他们的侵略政策和战争政策。
    莫斯科宣言说：“只要帝国主义还存在，就有发生侵略战争的土壤”。无数事实证明，这个论断是完全正确的。莫斯科宣言指出这一点，当然不是为了使人们丧失保卫世界和平的信心，相反的，正是为了唤起“世界各国人民对于帝国主义所造成的战争危险必须保持最大的警惕”，从而使各国人民能够更有效地为保卫世界和平而斗争。
    莫斯科宣言强调指出，“现在，争取和平、争取和平共处，成了世界各国最广大群众的要求。各国共产党认为争取和平的斗争是自己的首要任务。它们将同一切爱好和平的力量在一起，竭尽全力来防止战争”。
    以苏联为首的社会主义各国一贯坚持和平外交政策，主张不同社会制度的国家和平共处，争取经过谈判解决国际争端，始终不懈地为和缓国际紧张局势而努力，我国早在一九五四年就同印度、缅甸共同倡导了和平共处的五项原则，在一九五五年的万隆会议上又同亚非各国共同制定了和平共处的十项原则。多年来，我们一直根据这些原则来处理我国同东南亚各友邻国家及其他国家的关系，并且获得了显著的成就。今年，我国同缅甸和尼泊尔分别签订了和平共处的友好条约。苏联为了争取解决国际上的重大问题，几年来为促成四国政府首脑会议而努力。这种努力，正如同苏联提出的裁军建议和其他和缓国际紧张局势的主张一样，都一贯受到中国和其他社会主义国家的支持。在四国政府首脑会议被美国破坏以后，苏联和其他社会主义国家仍然不放弃和平谈判的途径。所有这些事实都证明，实现不同社会制度国家的和平共处，障碍不在社会主义国家方面，而在以美国为首的帝国主义国家方面。
    经验证明，帝国主义者非到万不得已的时候，总是不愿意同社会主义国家进行认真谈判。对于在谈判中已经达成的协议，帝国主义也常常加以撕毁或破坏。例如，在第二次世界大战结束时签订的波茨坦协定，就由于以美国为首的帝国主义者背信弃义而不能全部执行。朝鲜停战协定和印度支那停战协定，在执行中也部分地受到了美帝国主义的破坏。
    为了使帝国主义不能不同意进行谈判，为了使谈判能有成效，就必须不断地增强社会主义国家的力量，还必须不断地加强世界各国人民反对帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策的斗争。如果在谈判中达成协议，要使协议不被破坏，也必须依靠社会主义国家和世界各国人民的不懈努力。在任何时候都不能轻信帝国主义。
    莫斯科宣言强调指出，必须有反帝国主义的强大力量联合的斗争，才能保卫世界和平。宣言说：“维护着和平事业的是当代的这些强大的力量：不可摧毁的以苏联为首的社会主义阵营；站在反帝立场上并且同社会主义国家一起构成广大和平地区的亚非爱好和平的国家；国际工人阶级，首先是它的先锋队—共产党；殖民地和半殖民地人民的解放运动；世界各国人民争取和平的群众运动。坚决反抗新战争的策划的，还有欧洲宣布中立各国的人民，拉丁美洲的人民以及帝国主义国家的人民群众。这些强大力量的联合可以阻止战争的爆发。如果帝国主义的战争狂人硬要不顾一切发动战争，那么帝国主义就注定灭亡，因为人民绝不会再继续容忍那个给他们带来如此惨重的痛苦和牺牲的制度。”
    两年多来，这些反帝国主义的强大力量联合的斗争，不断地挫败了并且在继续挫败着以美国为首的帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策。莫斯科宣言指出：“目前，和平的力量已经大大成长，已经有实际可能来防止战争。”帝国主义好战集团及其在各国的走狗，在全世界上只是一小撮人。各国的工人、农民、大多数的知识分子、被压迫民族的民族资产阶级以及资本主义国家中的和平人士，都是帝国主义战争政策的受害者，他们都站在或者可以站在保卫世界和平、反对帝国主义的方面来，他们占全人类的绝大多数。革命人民有百分之九十以上。大家看，斗争的结果，是落到百分之九十以上的革命人民的手里呢？还是落到不到百分之十的帝国主义及各国反动派的手里呢？请看今日之域中，竟是谁家之天下？
    现在全世界各国人民的主要任务就是要结成最广泛的反对以美国为首的帝国主义的统一战线，坚决地同美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策进行斗争。各国人民正在为争取实现裁减军备、取消在国外的军事基地、禁止核武器、建立欧洲和亚洲的集体安全、使一切殖民地得到独立等等而努力，以达到制止帝国主义战争、保卫世界和平的目的。全世界各国人民越来越广泛地团结到这个反对以美国为首的帝国主义的统一战线中来，进行共同的斗争，世界和平就越有保障。但是，正如上面所述的，在帝国主义还存在的时候，决不能抱有不切实际的和平幻想，决不能对帝国主义发动战争的危险性放松警惕。只有在地球上消灭了帝国主义制度和资本主义制度，真正消灭了阶级的时候，才会真正出现世界的永久和平。
    不管以美国为首的帝国主义怎样疯狂地扩军备战，进行垂死挣扎，它们终究不能逃避最后灭亡的命运。宣言说得好：“这些反人民的帝国主义侵略势力所实行的政策使它们自取灭亡，自己造成埋葬自己的掘墓人。”帝国主义制度终归要被各国人民所推翻，资本主义制度终归要被社会主义制度所代替，这是社会发展的客观规律，是不依任何阶级、任何集团、任何政党、任何个人的主观意志为转移的。
    莫斯科宣言论述了关于从资本主义向社会主义过渡的不同形式的问题，认为在一些资本主义国家里，以自己的先进队伍为首的工人阶级要根据具体的可能性，“为和平实现社会主义革命准备必要的条件”。但是，“在剥削阶级对人民使用暴力的条件下，就必须考虑另外一种可能，即非和平地过渡到社会主义。”
    工人阶级和劳动人民当然愿意用和平方式取得政权，过渡到社会主义。如果有这种可能而不加以利用，是错误的。但是，统治阶级总是不会自动让出政权，在人民起来进行革命的时候，总是实行暴力镇压。所以工人阶级和它的政党绝不能把自己的全部工作建筑在和平过渡的一种可能性上，而必须同时准备两种可能性，即和平过渡的可能性和非和平过渡的可能性。如果没有根据地把和平过渡说成是唯一的可能性，那是完全错误的。
    莫斯科宣言强调指出，“必须在共产党和工人党的队伍中，坚决克服修正主义和教条主义”。同时，宣言认为，“在目前条件下，主要的危险是修正主义，或者说右倾机会主义”。宣言指出：“资产阶级影响的存在，是修正主义的国内根源。屈服于帝国主义的压力，则是修正主义的国外根源。”
    莫斯科宣言说：“现代修正主义企图诽谤马克思列宁主义的伟大学说，说它是‘过了时的’，似乎目前对于社会发展已经丧失了意义。修正主义者力图腐蚀马克思主义的革命灵魂，破坏工人阶级和劳动人民对于社会主义的信心。他们否认在从资本主义向社会主义过渡的时期实行无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的历史必要性，否认马克思列宁主义政党的领导作用，否认无产阶级国际主义原则，要求放弃列宁主义关于党的建设的基本原则，首先是放弃民主集中制，要求把共产党从一个战斗的革命组织变成某种争论不休的俱乐部。”
    莫斯科宣言关于现代修正主义的这些论断，在两年多来的国际共产主义运动的发展中，越来越显示了它们的正确性和重要性。一切马克思列宁主义者必须坚持反对现代修正主义的斗争。当然，教条主义是必须反对的。教条主义脱离群众，脱离实际，不反对教条主义，就不可能引导我们的事业达到胜利。但是，决不能够借口反对教条主义，而抛弃马克思列宁主义的基本理论阵地，决不允许以修正主义代替马克思列宁主义。
    莫斯科宣言说：“为了有效地团结工人阶级，团结全体劳动人民和进步人类，团结全世界爱好自由和和平的力量，必须首先加强共产党和工人党本身的团结，加强各国共产党和工人党之间的团结。这种团结是一切更广泛的团结的核心，是工人阶级事业胜利的最基本的保证。”
    国际无产阶级的团结，各国共产党和工人党的团结，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的团结，中苏两国和中苏两党的团结，建立在马克思列宁主义的基础上，建立在莫斯科宣言的基础上。这种团结是牢不可破的，是经得起考验的。帝国主义国家对于任何一个社会主义国家的挑衅，就是对于一切社会主义国家的挑衅。社会主义各国坚决地支持苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫同志在巴黎四国政府首脑会议预备会议上的严正立场，又一次表现了社会主义阵营的伟大团结。帝国主义者和现代修正主义者进行挑拨离间，企图破坏我们的团结，那是徒劳的，他们的目的是永远达不到的。
    现在的世界形势很好。敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来。以美国为首的帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，在全世界到处激起人民群众越来越强烈的反抗。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民的民族民主革命斗争，英勇的日本人民反对美帝国主义和它的走狗的斗争，英勇的古巴人民反对美帝国主义的斗争，阿尔及利亚人民反对殖民主义、争取独立的斗争，还有南朝鲜人民、土耳其人民的斗争，所有这些斗争，都是对以美国为首的帝国主义者的沉重打击，都对保卫世界和平起了伟大的作用。这些斗争受到了全世界各国人民的支持，受到了全世界无产阶级的支持，受到了整个社会主义阵营的支持，受到了各国爱好和平、主持正义的人士的支持。
    我们相信，随着各国人民保卫世界和平、反对帝国主义的斗争的发展，随着各国人民革命斗争的发展，随着国际共产主义运动的发展，随着马克思列宁主义的发展，无产阶级的国际团结一定会不断地巩固起来和不断地发展起来。正如出席罗马尼亚工人党第三次代表大会的社会主义国家共产党和工人党的会谈公报所说：“各国共产党和工人党今后仍将继续加强世界社会主义体系各国的团结，并将像爱护自己的眼珠一样维护自己在世界人民争取和平、安全和马克思列宁主义伟大事业的胜利的斗争中的一致。”
    让我们高举莫斯科宣言的马克思列宁主义的革命旗帜，奋勇前进吧！
