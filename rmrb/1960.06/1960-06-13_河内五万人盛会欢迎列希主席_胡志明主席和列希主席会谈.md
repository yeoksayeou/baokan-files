Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 12th June: Over 50,000 people from all walks of life in Hanoi held a grand rally this morning at Ba Dinh Square to warmly welcome the Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Assembly of Albania, Haxhi Lleshi, and the distinguished guests accompanying him on his visit.

Chairman Haxhi Lleshi spoke at the rally. He said that the Albanian people have been and will continue to firmly support the fraternal Vietnamese people's just struggle for the unification of their motherland and the implementation of the Geneva Accords.

Lleshi pointed out that the action of the U.S. authorities in sabotaging the Paris Four-Power Summit Conference proves that the peace and security of all nations are threatened by the aggressive U.S. imperialists.

Lleshi stressed that modern revisionism and its most dangerous representative, the Yugoslav revisionists, are a grave danger to the international communist and workers' movement. The revisionists not only attempt to divert the ideological orientation of the working class, but also attempt to make the working class abandon the path of Marxism-Leninism, making it weak and powerless in the face of capitalism and international reactionary groups. Chairman Lleshi pointed out that the Yugoslav revisionists are apologists for imperialism and condemned Yugoslavia for trying every means to oppose our country for seventeen years. He pointed out that their evil deeds have failed and will always fail.

Speaking about his impressions of his visit to China, Lleshi said that in China, we personally witnessed the drive, firm will, and selfless labor of the fraternal Chinese people engaged in the great cause of socialist construction. The great Chinese people, who were oppressed and impoverished in the past, are now advancing along the broad road of history.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh spoke at the meeting. He praised the great achievements made by the Albanian people and called on Vietnamese workers, farmers, intellectuals, and people from all walks of life to compete with the Albanian people based on their actual conditions.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 12th June: It was announced that the Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Albania, Haxhi Lleshi, held talks with Chairman Ho Chi Minh this afternoon at the Presidential Palace.
