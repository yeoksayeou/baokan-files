    Fully Utilize Every Inch of Fabric

    Save Fabric, Save Materials, New Style
    Recently, a Chinese-Western style Shanghai shirt has appeared on the Shanghai market. In the past, when making clothes, the main body was laid out in the middle of the fabric for cutting, and the remaining small pieces could not be used. Now, the main body is laid out on one side of the fabric, and the sleeves are cut on the other side, leaving as many scraps as possible for rational arrangement. The characteristic of this garment is its novel style. When the collar is buttoned up, it is a Chinese-style garment, and when opened, it looks like a Western-style garment. It saves one foot of fabric compared to a Western-style garment of the same specifications and is comfortable to wear.

    省布省料式样新
    最近，上海市场上，出现一种中西式上海衫。过去做衣服都是把正身摊在料子中间裁剪，剩下的小料不能利用。现在把正身摊在料子的一边，另一边裁袖子，尽量让出碎料，使小料合理安排。这件衣服的特点是式样新颖，领口钮起来是一件中式服装，翻开来又像一件西式服装，比一件同样规格的西式服装要节省一尺布料，而且穿着舒适。
