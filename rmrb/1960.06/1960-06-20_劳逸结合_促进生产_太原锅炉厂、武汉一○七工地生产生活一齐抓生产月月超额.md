Combining Work and Rest to Promote Production
Taiyuan Boiler Factory and Wuhan 107 Construction Site Focus on Both Production and Life, Exceeding Monthly Production Targets

This newspaper reports that the Taiyuan Boiler Factory adheres to the principle of combining work and rest, ensuring that over 95% of its employees can eat, rest, study, and enjoy recreation on time. As a result, the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers have been continuously rising, and production has been steadily advancing. As of June 10th, the factory had already exceeded 5.7% of its annual target, completing half of the year's plan ahead of schedule, and fulfilling 100.3% of the semi-annual plan, representing a 157.4% increase compared to the same period last year.

Since the beginning of the year, the factory has conscientiously followed the Party's policy of grasping both production and life. While comprehensively arranging various tasks, it has included ensuring workers have adequate work and rest on the Party committee's agenda and made specific arrangements. Specific regulations have also been made regarding the allocation of time for after-work collective activities. In addition, appropriate arrangements have been made for militia training, sports, and recreational activities. For necessary temporary after-work activities, such as large meetings, it was decided to be approved by the Party committee and solved by combining the exchange of original activities with long-term planning and short-term arrangements. Through the above series of rational arrangements and strict implementation, the factory's employees have truly achieved a combination of work and rest for over five months, reaping a triple harvest in production, technological revolution, and cultural revolution.

Reforming production management plays a significant role in ensuring the realization of combining work and rest. At the beginning of this year, they emphasized the spirit of catching up early and avoiding delays in production management and insisted on promoting the advanced experience of focusing on production in the first and middle ten days of the month and focusing on preparation in the last ten days. By the 25th of each month, the next month's work plan was issued to each workshop and team, and the drawings, materials, and blanks for the next month were prepared. At the same time, in arranging work plans, the past practice of low output in the first ten days and high output in the last ten days was completely changed. Based on the spirit of striving to catch up step by step and striving for initiative, it was specifically determined that 40% of the monthly plan would be completed in the first ten days, 45% in the middle ten days, and 15% in the last ten days. As a result, the monthly plan has been exceeded by four to seven days ahead of schedule for five months. After completing the current month's plan, they seized the opportunity to concentrate their efforts on preparing for the next month. In the process of grasping production, they always implemented a guiding ideology, namely "Grasp output value daily, grasp complete sets every ten days, and do everything possible to grasp measures." The "Daily Red, Ten-day Complete Set" red flag competition was widely and continuously carried out in various teams and workshops, doing the work of ten to twelve hours in eight hours; thus greatly promoting production and greatly reducing the phenomenon of working overtime to rush tasks, ensuring that workers get off work on time and rest on holidays.

Launching the masses to concentrate their efforts on making a technical revolution by issuing topics based on the key production periods and promoting a substantial increase in production is another important measure taken by this factory to ensure the realization of combining work and rest. For example, the boiler workshop plans to increase boiler production four times this year compared to last year. To overcome this hurdle, twelve major key problems were successively overcome, 416 various tools were manufactured, and mechanization and semi-mechanization were realized in sixteen processes, increasing boiler production from an average of eight units in the fourth quarter of last year to fourteen units, with a maximum of seventeen units; overtime was reduced from an average of more than 5,000 hours per month last year to 200 hours; and 15% of the labor force was also saved.

This newspaper reports from Wuhan on the 19th that the 107 Construction Site of the First Construction Engineering Company of Wuhan City conscientiously implements the policy of combining work and rest, comprehensively arranging the production, life, and study of employees, and achieving a combination of work and rest.

Since March 1959, more than 800 workers at the 107 Construction Site have adhered to the system of working eight hours and studying two hours every day. At the same time, they have also vigorously grasped the production of non-staple foods and actively run the canteen well. Their recreational activities are also relatively active, often drumming and singing. Because they paid attention to the combination of work and rest, it greatly promoted the development of production. Since 1959, this construction site has exceeded its targets every month and has been rising every quarter. In the first quarter of this year, with a 41.2% reduction in personnel, the production tasks increased by 109.39% compared to the same period last year, and the state plan was completed 4.78% ahead of schedule and 28 days ahead of schedule. By the end of May, they had completed 61.81% of the annual plan.

The main reason why this construction site can adhere to the combination of work and rest for a long time and achieve sustained leap forward in production is the firm implementation of the Party's instructions. They regard ensuring that employees sleep and rest well, like ensuring good production, as an important task of leadership. At the beginning of this year, under the circumstances of increasing production and reducing personnel, many employees and cadres had the idea that they could only complete the production tasks by working overtime. The Party Branch immediately seized this important issue and launched a large-scale debate on "Can work efficiency be doubled in eight hours of work?" from within the Party to outside the Party and from cadres to the masses. Through the debate, the ideas that "more people are good for doing things, and hard work is the most realistic" were criticized, and a climax of technical innovation and technical revolution was launched. From January to May, the construction site promoted more than 400 new equipment and new tools, saving 42.3% of the labor force.

Secondly, the leadership method is good. While comprehensively planning various work tasks, they adopted the method of "major matters are decided collectively, minor matters are carried out separately, tasks are divided into lines, in-depth division into areas, grasping everything when going down, and re-separating when coming up," and carried out various tasks in an orderly manner. In management work, they deeply realized that grasping production with one hand and preparing with the other, striving for initiative and overcoming passivity, is an important measure to ensure a combination of work and rest and rhythmic production.

Streamlining meetings, changing work styles, going deep into production to solve problems are another important experience of this construction site in effectively leading production and leading rest. In March of this year, the Party Branch inspected the phenomenon of "five more and five less" and streamlined the meetings, enabling the leading cadres to be "liberated" from the meetings and often go deep into production, eat, live, and work with the masses, and jointly study and solve problems. In early June, when Zhang Shuiqing, the secretary of the Party Branch, inspected the work of the First Engineering Section, he found that the two production automatic lines of concrete and plastering in the engineering section were stopped due to equipment and technical problems. He studied with the workers and worked hard with them until the two automatic lines resumed production before transferring the position. The workers said excitedly: "When Secretary Zhang came, he saved two dragons." In May, when the First Engineering Section canteen had problems because of the bad attitude of individual cooks and poor hygiene, the chairman of the trade union moved his luggage to the canteen to live with the cooks and study solutions. He did not leave the canteen until the canteen was well run and the masses were satisfied.

At present, all employees of this construction site, with communist ambition and aspirations, are guaranteeing that 80% of the annual plan will be completed in the first half of the year, and dedicating themselves to "July 1st" with gifts.

    劳逸结合　促进生产
    太原锅炉厂、武汉一○七工地生产生活一齐抓生产月月超额
    本报讯　太原锅炉厂坚持有劳有逸的原则，95％以上的职工都能按时吃饭、休息、学习、娱乐。因此，广大职工的劳动积极性、创造性日益高涨，生产持续跃进。截至6月10日，全厂已经超额5．7％提前完成全年计划的一半，完成上半年计划的100．3％，为去年同期的157．4％。
    这个厂从年初开始就认真遵照党的一手抓生产、一手抓生活的方针，在全面安排各项工作的同时，把保证职工有劳有逸列入党委的议事日程，并做了具体的安排。在业余集体活动的时间分配方面，也作了具体规定。此外，对于民兵训练，体育、文娱等业余活动，也都作了适当的安排。对于必要的临时性业余活动，如开大会等，决定由党委批准，采取与原定活动调换和长计划与短安排相结合的办法解决。通过上述一系列的合理安排和严格执行，五个多月来这个厂的职工真正做到了有劳有逸，获得了生产和技术革命、文化革命三丰收。
    改革生产管理，对保证实现有劳有逸，起的作用也很大。今年一开始，他们就在生产管理方面十分强调赶前不拖后的精神，坚持推行了上中旬狠抓生产、下旬狠抓准备的先进经验。每月都做到了25日给各车间、小组下达下月作业计划，准备好下月的图纸、材料和毛坯。同时，在安排作业计划中，彻底改变了过去上旬低、下旬高的作法，根据步步赶前、力争主动的精神具体确定：下旬完成月计划的40％，中旬完成45％，下旬完成15％，因而五个月来每月的计划都能提前四至七天超额完成。在完成本月计划后，又乘胜集中精力为下月作准备。在抓生产的过程中，他们始终贯彻了一条指导思想，即“日抓产值，旬抓成套，千方百计抓措施”。各小组、车间普遍地、持续地开展了“日日红、旬成套”红旗竞赛，在八小时做十至十二小时的活；从而大大地促进了生产，大大减少了加班加点突击赶任务的现象，保证了职工们按时下班和假日的休息。
    针对每个时期的生产关键，用出课题的方式发动群众集中火力大闹技术革命，促进生产大幅度增长，是这个厂保证实现有劳有逸的另一项重要措施。如锅炉车间今年锅炉生产要比去年提高四倍，为了突破这一关，相继攻克了十二个重大关键问题，制造成各种工具四百一十六件，在十六道工序上实现了机械化半机械化，使锅炉产量从去年第四季度平均八台提高到十四台，最高达到十七台；加班加点由去年每月平均五千多小时，降低到二百个小时；同时还节约出15％的劳动力。
    本报武汉19日电　武汉市第一建筑工程公司一○七工地认真贯彻劳逸结合的方针，全面安排职工的生产、生活、学习，做到了有劳有逸。
    从1959年3月以来，一○七工地八百多名工人就一直坚持每天劳动八小时，学习二小时的制度。同时还大抓副食品生产，积极办好食堂。他们的文娱活动也比较活跃，经常敲锣打鼓，有说有唱。由于注意了劳逸结合，大大促进了生产的发展。这个工地从1959年以来，月月超额，季季上升。今年一季度，在人员减少41．2％的情况下，生产任务却比去年同期增长了109．39％，提前二十八天超额4．78％完成了国家计划。至5月底，他们已完成全年计划的61．81％。
    这个工地能够长期坚持有劳有逸，实现生产持续跃进，主要是坚决贯彻了党的指示。他们把保证职工睡好休息好，像保证生产好一样，作为领导工作的一项重要任务来看待。今年年初，在增产又减人的情况下，不少职工和干部曾产生了只有加班加点，才能完成生产任务的思想。党总支立即抓住这个重要问题，从党内到党外，从干部到群众，开展了“工作八小时，能不能工效翻一番”的大鸣大放大辩论。通过辩论，批判了那些认为“人多好办事，苦战最现实”的思想，掀起了技术革新和技术革命高潮。从元月至5月份，工地推广了各种新设备、新工具四百多件，节约了42．3％的劳动力。
    其次是领导方法好。他们对各项工作任务进行全面规划的同时，采取了“大事集体定，小事分头行，任务分线，深入分片，下去一把抓，上来再分家”的办法，有条不紊地开展各项工作。在管理工作上他们深深体会到，一手抓生产，一手抓准备，争取主动，克服被动，是保证有劳有逸有节奏生产的一项重要措施。
    精简会议，转变作风，深入生产解决问题，是该工地切实领导好生产、领导好休息的另一条重要经验。今年3月份，党总支检查了
  “五多五少”现象，精简了会议，使领导干部从会议中“解放”出来，经常深入生产，与群众同吃同住同劳动，一起研究解决问题。6月初，党总支书记章水清到一工段检查工作时，发现该工段混凝土和粉刷两条生产自动线，因设备和技术问题停止了生产。他就与工人共同研究，一同苦战，一直到两条自动线恢复了生产，才转移了阵地。工人兴奋的说：“章书记一来，救活了两条龙”。5月份当一工段食堂因个别炊事人员态度不好，清洁卫生差，群众有意见时，工会主席就把行李搬到食堂里去和炊事人员住在一起，研究解决办法。一直到食堂办好了，群众满意了，他才离开食堂。
    目前，这个工地的全体职工，正以共产主义的雄心壮志，保证上半年完成全年计划80％，向“七一”献礼。
