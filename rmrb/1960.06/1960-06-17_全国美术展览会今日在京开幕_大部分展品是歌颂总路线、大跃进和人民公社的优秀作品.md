Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The National Art Exhibition opened in Beijing on the 17th. This exhibition features nearly nine hundred selected art pieces from provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country. The exhibits include various forms such as Chinese paintings, oil paintings, prints, sculptures, New Year pictures, propaganda posters, cartoons, comic strips, paper cuttings, illustrations, watercolors, sketches, and quick sketches. The majority of these works are outstanding pieces depicting real life since the Great Leap Forward, praising the three red banners of the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes from various aspects and angles, and demonstrating the new spiritual outlook of the Chinese people. The exhibits also include landscapes, flowers and birds, scenery, portraits, and some works depicting historical themes, all filled with new ideological content and new vitality. This exhibition showcases the achievements of the great leap forward in art creation in our country over the past two years.

Among the more than two hundred and fifty exquisite traditional Chinese paintings, there are not only magnificent large-scale paintings depicting the Chinese people's efforts to move mountains and seas, transform nature, and the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, but also moving scenes full of life and depicting every corner of real life. It can be seen that Chinese painters, by going deep into life and constantly improving their skills, have become increasingly mature in using traditional techniques to express new realistic themes. The oil paintings exhibited this time have greatly improved in terms of ideological and artistic level. They not only reflect vivid real life, but also shape the images of various heroic figures, and new attempts have also been made in the nationalization of oil painting. The prints, with their concise composition and novel style, are very thought-provoking, showing the leap forward progress of Chinese print art. New Year pictures with strong folk colors, cartoons with strong combativeness, and propaganda posters closely related to various central movements are all works that have been deeply loved by the broad masses. The latest creations in the exhibits include the oil paintings "Red Flag Planted on Mount Everest," "Chairman Mao and the Latin American People Together," and the sculpture "Awakening," which depicts the African people breaking free from their shackles.

The authors participating in this exhibition include well-known veteran painters from across the country, a large number of young painters, amateur art authors from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and many collective creations. In particular, many excellent works have been produced in remote areas where artistic creation was previously weak, such as Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, and Xinjiang. This exhibition is held separately in the Forbidden City, Beihai Park, and the Art Exhibition Hall. Previews were held on the 15th and 16th, and famous figures from all walks of life in the capital were invited to visit the exhibition.

    全国美术展览会今日在京开幕
    大部分展品是歌颂总路线、大跃进和人民公社的优秀作品
    新华社16日讯　全国美术展览会17日在北京开幕。这次展览会展出了来自全国各省、市、自治区精选的近九百幅美术作品。展品中包括中国画、油画、版画、雕塑、年画、宣传画、漫画、连环画、剪纸、插图、水彩、素描、速写等多种形式。这些作品，大部分是表现大跃进以来现实生活的优秀作品，从各个方面、各种不同角度歌颂党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，表现了我国人民新的精神面貌。展品中也有充满新的思想内容、新的生活气息的山水、花鸟、风景、人像和部分表现历史题材的作品。这次展出，显示了近两年来我国美术创作大跃进的成就。
    在二百五十多幅精美的国画中，不仅有气魄雄伟的、表现我国人民群众移山倒海、改造大自然、工农业大跃进的巨幅画图，也有富于生活情趣的、表现现实生活各个角落的动人图景，可以看出国画家们由于深入生活不断提高技巧，在运用传统技巧表现新的现实题材方面，已日渐成熟。这次展出的油画，在思想和艺术水平方面都有很大提高，不但反映了生动的现实生活，还塑造了各种英雄人物的形象，在油画民族化方面也进行了新的尝试。构图简明、风格新颖的版画，十分耐人寻味，显示了我国版画艺术的飞跃进步。富有浓厚民间色彩的年画、具有强烈战斗性的漫画和紧密结合各项中心运动的宣传画，都是曾深受广大群众喜爱的作品。展品中最新的创作有油画“红旗插上珠穆朗玛峰”、“毛主席和拉丁美洲人民在一起”，还有表现非洲人民挣断枷锁的雕塑“觉醒”等。
    参加这次展品的作者，有全国著名的老画家，有大批青年画家，也有工农兵业余美术作者，还有不少集体的创作。特别是过去美术创作力量薄弱的边远地区，如青海、内蒙古、新疆等地，都产生了不少优秀作品。这次展览会分别在故宫、北海公园、美术展览馆展出。15、16日举行了预展，首都各界著名人士应邀参观了展览会。
