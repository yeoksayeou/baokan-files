Xinhua News Agency, June 14th: The China-Latin America Friendship Association held an opening ceremony for the "Peruvian Cultural and Artistic Exhibition" this morning at the Water Pavilion in Zhongshan Park.

    Chu Tunan, President of the China-Latin America Friendship Association, delivered the opening speech, first congratulating the opening of the exhibition. He said that this is the first exhibition from Peru to our country, and it marks a new development in the friendship between the Chinese and Peruvian people. It will promote the Chinese people's understanding of Peruvian culture.

    Chu Tunan said that in recent years, the national and democratic movements in Peru and other Latin American countries have flourished. The struggles of the people of Latin American countries against the oppression and plunder of U.S. imperialism have achieved a series of victories. The Chinese people have always been concerned with the just struggles of the people of Peru and other Latin American countries with brotherly feelings, and have been overjoyed by their continuous victories. As Chairman Mao said: Our common enemy is U.S. imperialism. We all stand on the same front and need to unite and support each other. The Peruvian people can count on the firm support of the 650 million Chinese people in their struggle to safeguard national independence and fight for democracy.

    Dr. Manuel Beltroy Vera, head of the Peruvian cultural friendship delegation, spoke. He said that presenting this small exhibition to the Chinese people expresses the warm friendship of our Peruvian people to the brotherly Chinese people, and our admiration for China's great achievements in socialist construction and safeguarding world peace. He emphasized that the exhibition also signifies that our two countries have formed a brotherly friendship in the common task and struggle of supporting oppressed nations in their fight for liberation, defeating and eliminating oppressors.

    The exhibition was jointly organized by the Cultural Promotion Department of the University of San Marcos in Lima, Peru, and the Peru-China Friendship Association.
