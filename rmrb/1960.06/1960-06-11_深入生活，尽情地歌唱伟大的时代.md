Plunging into Life, Singing Enthusiastically of the Great Era
Sun Laikui, Actor of the Hebei Province Qu Yi Troupe

I am a Qu Yi actor who has been singing Xihe Dagu (a form of Chinese folk storytelling) for over twenty years. From a young age, I remember my family having 1.8 mu of land, which was later forced to be sold to the landlord. To survive, I had to take my mother to Northeast China, where I went from being a coolie to learning storytelling, living a life of beatings, suffering, and darkness in hunger and cold all year round. At that time, let alone creating, I didn't even understand the term "creation." After liberation, the government gave me the glorious title of literary and art worker. My political status improved, and my life also improved. I am sincerely grateful to the Communist Party and the People's Government. I, a Dagu singer, what can I do for the Party and the government? I thought in my heart that I could speak and sing. I wanted to express the people's gratitude to the Communist Party and the People's Government, but I couldn't find such lyrics. When the government called us to meetings, they encouraged us to write our own lyrics. At that time, I thought to myself: my cultural level is limited, and my political level is low, how can I have the ability to write books! However, the government repeatedly encouraged me, saying: "Good books are written by people too, try it, practice slowly if you don't write well." So I started to try writing. I wrote in my heart and sang with my mouth, what I saw, what I thought in my heart, that's how I sang. Because what I sang was all in everyone's heart, they were happy that I spoke for them, so the masses loved to listen. Because I made a little achievement, the leadership encouraged me even more, and also told me what to sing, what to write, what to pay attention to, and how to cooperate with the central work. The more the leaders talked, the happier I was, and the more motivated I was to work. In this way, under the kind guidance and specific help of the Party and the government, I cooperated with a series of political movements and the central work of various periods. For example, "Liberating Northeast China" and "China and the Soviet Union as One Family," which I composed in Dalian, promoted the great and profound friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union; "Production Joy" and "Bright Sky in the Northeast," which I composed and sang, promoted the new face of the people of Northeast China under the leadership of the democratic government. In 1949, I returned to my hometown of Hengshui, farming and storytelling at the same time. During the literacy campaign, I wrote "Illiteracy Suffers Losses"; during the army expansion, I wrote "Xue Lanfang Enrolls"; when reactionary sects were banned, I wrote and sang "Accusing the Yiguandao"; when Shanghai and Jinan were liberated, I wrote "Liberating Shanghai" and "Capturing Wang Yaowu Alive"; during the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, I wrote "Lovely Motherland." In 1951, I joined the county's Qu Yi troupe. When publicizing the Marriage Law, I wrote "Village Government Gets Married"; during the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Campaigns, I wrote "Big Road Hand"; during the unified purchase and sale, I wrote "Selling Surplus Grain"; at the beginning of the cooperative movement, I wrote "Mutual Aid Group's Cotton" and "Model Breeder"; when publicizing hygiene and science, I wrote "New and Old Obstetrics." From 1953 to now, I estimate that there are more than 130 pieces. Through writing these hundred and more pieces, I went from not daring to write to daring to write, from not knowing how to knowing how, from slow to fast, from little to much. Although the writing is still very rough, I have gained a lot and received a great deal of education, and learned a lot of valuable knowledge. I deeply realized that as long as I listen to the Party, rely on the Party, and rely on the masses, there is nothing that cannot be done. No matter what kind of work you do, you will inevitably encounter difficulties. As long as you are not scared by difficulties, there is no task that cannot be completed. For example, when I first started writing, my cultural level was very low, my literacy was limited, and it was difficult to even hold a pen. I wanted to ask people for words I couldn't write, but I was afraid of interfering with their work. What to do? I bought a homophone dictionary myself. If I couldn't write a word, I would look it up. If I couldn't write well, I would practice hard. Now, I not only recognize many words, but also write them properly.

    The Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1958 made me very excited. As soon as the Great Leap Forward began, the leadership told me: "Get ready to write! Sing!" Sure enough, in a few days, An'guo County saw the miracle of high-yield wheat. The leadership immediately assigned me the task of composing and singing about this, and personally led us to participate in field labor, visited the wheat stubble field where the high-yield miracle occurred, interviewed the members who managed the wheat field, and also learned about the ideological remarks of the "observer" faction; and also learned about the causes and consequences of the matter in detail from the branch secretary. The more I listened, the more I was moved. I couldn't write it down in time, and I couldn't stand not singing it out. I mustered my courage and sang it out that night while wading through the water! "Wading through the water" means not writing a manuscript, but composing and singing in my heart. Although the words and sentences were rough, the members loved to listen to it, and provided many valuable opinions to help modify it. The leaders of the Provincial Department of Culture attached great importance to this first draft and said to me: "Great Leap Forward, the members have created such an amazing miracle, we must also leap forward. This work must be written well." I was determined to write it well. The Party and the masses were very concerned when I was writing this thing. The leaders of the Provincial Department of Culture sent someone to tutor me, organized discussions, and revised it repeatedly, telling me how to arrange the structure, contradictions, and struggles of the story, how to use exaggeration techniques, and how to combine revolutionary romanticism and revolutionary realism. At that time, my head was buzzing with tension. After the manuscript of this program was finalized, I calmed down and recalled it. I was extremely happy! Through writing this work, I took a big step forward in my creative level. I also learned some new knowledge about creation. In 1958, I participated in the first National Qu Yi Performance and was praised by the central leaders and people from all walks of life in the capital. After the performance, I also gloriously participated in the Fujian Front Comfort Group organized by the Central Ministry of Culture, went deep into the front lines, and personally fired cannons to punish the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. What made me particularly excited was that this work was published in full in our Party newspaper, the People's Daily, which I never dared to think about in the past. This year, the Provincial People's Congress and the Political Consultative Conference also invited me to participate and sit with the leaders to discuss national affairs. Today, I am attending the National Conference of Heroes in Culture and Education. I am both excited and moved. I fully understand that this is the result of the thorough liberation of Qu Yi artists, the result of implementing the Party's literary and art policy and studying Chairman Mao's literary and art thoughts! It is the honor given by the Party. Glory belongs to the Party, to the collective!

    Chairman Mao taught us that life is the source of creation, and without life, there is no literary and artistic creation. This has a great educational effect on me. After the people's communes were established, the leadership encouraged me to vigorously reflect this new thing. So I found some materials and started writing in the room. For three consecutive days, I wrote a lot, but it was just a pile of waste paper. Because I hadn't seen what a people's commune was like. How could this be written? So I went home. My wife worked as a cook in the commune's canteen. I helped her cook in the canteen for more than ten days, chatting with the members in my spare time, hearing and seeing, understanding the situation, and quickly wrote "Model Cook" and "Old Man and County Head."

    In the spring of 1959, I was transferred to the Provincial Qu Yi Troupe. The leadership gave me the task of reflecting the thousand-mu field in An'guo County. This time, I didn't squat in the room and get bored. I quickly went to the Wurenqiao Commune in An'guo. I was excited when I saw the thousand-mu field. I was born in the countryside since I was a child, and I had never seen such a good wheat field. It was really as straight as a line, the ground was as flat as a mirror, a thousand mu was boundless, like a wonderfully ingenious picture. I thought to myself, without the Great Leap Forward and the people's commune, how could there be such a wheat field? I couldn't wait to sing it out immediately and let everyone know the achievements of the Great Leap Forward and the superiority of the people's commune. There, I performed, visited, and wrote at the same time. I stayed for more than ten days and finished writing. When the leader saw it after I came back, he said it was not good, not vivid and not profound. He also said: "The thousand-mu field is a big thing with many people. It can't be written by just taking a quick look for ten days. Go back quickly and eat, live, and work with the members, and make friends with the members!" I went back to the thousand-mu field and lived with the professional team that managed the wheat field, working and resting together, and performing for them. After a long time, everyone was familiar with each other. Before, people called me Comrade, but later they all called me Comrade Sun. As soon as there was a little free time, they would tell me stories about the thousand-mu field. How the land was cultivated, how the ridges were leveled. They even told me about their love affairs. In this way, I listened, thought, labored, and wrote at the same time. After finishing writing and coming back, after the leaders put forward their opinions, I went back again, sang to the members for their opinions, and also asked the leaders to help process it. In this way, after going to An'guo three times and revising the first draft nine times, I finally wrote it into its current form. Because I lived there for a long time, I understood it in detail, and continued to write the second and third paragraphs, forming the "Thousand-Mu Field Trilogy," as a small gift to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country. At the end of the year, I took the first paragraph of this trilogy to participate in the central government's performance of excellent Qu Yi programs from some provinces and cities, and received praise from the leaders and comrades. The People's Daily published the full text of "Night Visit to the Thousand-Mu Field."

    In October 1959, the leadership gave me the task of Yuecheng Reservoir. I was so happy. It was a great honor to be able to participate in such a large project and to sing for the heroes who tamed the Zhang River. Moreover, I could also familiarize myself with the life of building a large reservoir. This was also a good opportunity for me to learn. When I set off, the leaders told me that I had to go deep into life and submit my work when I came back. I happily accepted this task. As soon as I arrived at the reservoir construction site, the Party committee attached great importance to and supported my work, introducing me to the situation of the reservoir and typical heroic deeds. At first, they asked me to stay in the guest house. Most of the people living in the guest house came to the reservoir to study, visit, and work. I thought to myself that this was not a place to go deep into life. The next day, I and my accompanist moved to the workers' shed and lived with the migrant workers! Before arriving at the reservoir, I was always afraid that I would not be able to write any pieces. Who knew that once I lived in the workers' shed and ate, lived, and worked with the migrant workers, the themes that I heard, saw, and should reflect were too numerous to count. I was so moved that I wrote and sang at the same time, always afraid that I would not be able to finish singing. In seventeen days, I composed and sang five pieces from the construction site. These five pieces were not only welcomed by the migrant workers, but were also published in magazines.

    The work I have done is far behind the achievements of the comrades on the industrial and agricultural fronts, and my enthusiasm is far behind. But the Party and everyone encourage me, saying that I am a "red banner bearer in Qu Yi" and a "model in Qu Yi." I understand that this is the Party and the comrades cultivating and encouraging me. I, a Qu Yi artist with a very low level of education, what can I do? In the past few years, I have deeply realized that relying on the Party and relying on the masses can do a good job; standing firm on the proletarian stand can correctly analyze things and handle themes; studying Chairman Mao's works hard can improve my political and ideological level; constantly going deep into life and throwing myself into the fiery production struggle can write good works that suit the tastes of the working people. I heard some people say that "going to the mountains and countryside and cooperating with the central task will damage art and reduce the quality of art" and "more and faster cannot be good and economical." I will never believe these statements. Because the countless excellent programs that have appeared in the country in the past two years fully prove that these statements are wrong. Cooperating with the central task can be more, faster, better, and more economical. I personally have had a personal experience with this. However, the little work I have done is far from enough. This is just a little bit of the countless heroic and exemplary deeds in real life that I have reflected with my pen and mouth by following the teachings of the Party and accepting the help of the masses. In the future, I will guard against arrogance and rashness, exert greater efforts, study Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works hard, and strive to make greater achievements in 1960 to respond to the encouragement of the Party and the people. I must further play the role of "vanguard," closely cooperate with political tasks, and create more and better works to dedicate to the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the great Communist Party of China.

    深入生活，尽情地歌唱伟大的时代
    河北省曲艺队演员　孙来奎
    我是一个唱了二十多年西河大鼓的曲艺演员。从小时就记得家里有一亩八分地，后来也被迫卖给地主了。为了活命，我只得带着母亲下了关东，由卖苦力到学会说书，常年过着挨打、受气、暗无天日的饥寒生活。那时，别说搞创作，就连“创作”这个名词我也不懂。解放后政府给了我文艺工作者的光荣称号，政治地位提高了，生活也得到了改善。我从心眼里感激共产党和人民政府。我，一个说大鼓的，能给党和政府干些什么呢？我心里就想，我能说能唱，我要把人们心眼里感激共产党、人民政府的话都说出来，唱出来，可就是找不到这样的鼓词。政府一找我们去开会，就鼓励我们大家自己编。那时我心里想：自己文化有限，政治水平又低，怎么会有编书的能力呀！可是，政府再三地鼓励说：“天好的书也是人编的，试试看，编不好慢慢练。”我这才开始试编。心里编嘴里唱，怎么见到的，心里怎么想的，就怎么唱。因为我唱的全是大家心里的事，他们的高兴都叫我替他们说出来了，所以群众都爱听。由于作出了一点成绩，领导上就更加鼓励我，还告诉我应该唱什么，编什么，注意什么问题，怎样配合中心工作。领导讲的越多，我心里也就越高兴，干着也就越带劲。就这样，在党和政府的亲切教导和具体帮助下，我配合了一系列的政治运动和各个时期的中心工作。如在大连时编的“解放东北”和“中苏一家人”，宣传了中苏两国人民伟大深厚的友谊；编唱的“生产乐”和“关东地区明朗天”，宣传了东北人民在民主政府领导之下的新面貌。1949年，我重新回到了我的老家——衡水，一边种地，一边说书。在扫盲时我编了“文盲吃亏”；扩军时编了“薛兰芳报名”；取缔反动会道门时编唱了“控诉一贯道”；上海、济南解放时，编了“解放上海”和“活捉王耀武”；抗美援朝时，编了“可爱的祖国”。1951年我参加了本县的曲艺队，在宣传婚姻法时，编了“村政府上轿”；三反、五反时，编了“大路手”；统购统销时，编了“卖余粮”；合作化开始时，编了“互助组的棉花”和“模范饲养员”；宣传讲卫生、讲科学时，编了“新旧接生法”。这从1953年到现在，粗略估计足有一百三十多段。通过编这一百多个段子，我由不敢编到敢编，由不会到会，由慢到快，由少到多。虽然编的还很粗糙，我可得了不少收获，受到了很大教育，学习了许多宝贵知识。我深深地体会到，只要听党的话，依靠党，依靠群众，就没有做不了的事。无论搞什么工作，也难免遇到困难，只要不叫困难吓住，就没有完成不了的任务。例如：我才写作时，文化很低，识字有限，拿笔都困难。不会写的字想去问人，但又怕妨碍人家的工作。怎么办？自己就买了个同音字典，不会写就查。字写不好，就用心练，练到现在，字不但认了很多，而且写的也像个样子了。
    1958年工农业生产大跃进，使我非常兴奋。大跃进一开始，领导上就告诉我：“你作好准备盯着写吧！唱吧！”不错，日子不多，安国县就出现了小麦高额丰产的奇迹。领导上立即把这个编唱任务交给我，又亲自带我们到那里参加了田间劳动，参观了出现丰产奇迹的那块麦茬地，访问了管理麦田的社员，也了解了观潮派人物的思想言论；又向支部书记详细地了解了事情的前因后果。我越听越受感动，现写来不及，不唱出去又憋的难受，鼓了鼓劲，当天晚上就趟着水唱出去啦！“趟水”就是不写稿，心里编嘴里唱。“趟水”尽管是词句粗糙，社员可都很爱听，还提供了很多宝贵的意见，帮助修改，省文化局领导上对这个初稿非常重视，对我说：“大跃进，人家社员搞出这样了不起的奇迹，咱们也得跃进，这个作品要把它写得好好的。”我就下定决心，要把它写好。写这个东西时党和群众非常关怀。省文化局领导上派专人辅导，组织讨论，反复修改，告诉应该怎样安排故事的结构、矛盾、斗争，怎样的运用夸张手法，革命浪漫主义和革命现实主义如何结合等。当时我紧张得脑子里嗡嗡的直响。等到把这个节目的稿子定下来之后，冷静地回忆了一下，我高兴极啦！通过写这篇作品，我在创作水平上大大地跃进了一步。我又更多地知道了一些创作上的新知识。1958年我就以这个节目参加了第一届全国曲艺汇报演出，受到中央首长和首都各界人民的好评。在会演以后，我又光荣地参加了中央文化部组织的福建前线慰问团，深入前沿阵地，并亲自开炮惩罚蒋贼。特别使我兴奋的，过去连想也不敢想的是，这个作品在我们的党报——人民日报上全文发表了。今年省人代会、政协会还邀请我参加，和首长坐在一起，讨论国家大事。今天我又出席全国文教群英大会。我是又兴奋又感动。我完全懂得，这是曲艺艺人彻底翻身解放的结果，是贯彻党的文艺方针和学习毛主席文艺思想的结果！是党给的荣誉。光荣归于党，归于集体！
    毛主席教导我们，生活是创作的源泉，离开了生活就没有文艺创作。这对我有极大的教育作用。人民公社化后，领导鼓励我，要大力反映这一新生事物。于是我找了些材料，蹲到屋里就写开了。一连三天，写了很多，可就是字纸一堆。因为人民公社是个啥样我还没有见到过。这怎能写成呢？于是我就回了家。我爱人在公社食堂当炊事员。我帮她在食堂做了十几天饭，抽空和社员一起聊天，耳闻目睹，了解了情况，回来后很快就写出了“模范炊事员”、“老人与县长”等作品。
    1959年春天，我调到了省曲艺队。领导上给了我反映安国县千亩田的创作任务。这次我可不蹲在屋里挨憋了，很快就到了安国伍仁桥公社。一见到千亩田我就激动。我自幼生在农村，真没见过这么好的大麦田，真是埂直如线，地平如镜，千亩无边，像是一张工巧绝妙的图画。我心想若没有大跃进和人民公社，哪能有这样的麦田呢？我恨不能马上就唱出去，叫人人都知道大跃进的成就和人民公社的优越性。在那里，我边演出、边访问、边编写，呆了十几天就写完了。回来后领导一看，说不行，不生动不深刻。又说：“千亩田事大人多，决不是走马观花十几天就能写出来的，赶紧回去和社员们同吃同住同劳动，和社员们交朋友去吧！”我又回到千亩田，和管麦田的专业队住在一起，一同干活一同休息，给他们演唱，日子一长全熟啦。先前人家叫我同志，后来都叫我孙伙计，一有点空就给我讲千亩田的故事。地是怎么搞的，岗是怎么平的。他们连搞恋爱的事都要向我说。就这样，我一边听，一边想；一边劳动，一边编写。写完回来，等领导提出修改意见后又回去，向社员唱完征求意见，还请领导帮助加工。就这样，经过三下安国，九改初稿，最后才写成了现在这个样子。因为在那里生活的日子较长，了解得细致，又继续写出第二段、第三段，组成了“千亩田三部曲”，作为献给建国十周年的薄礼。年底又拿这三部曲的第一段，参加了中央举行的部分省市优秀曲艺节目汇报演出，得到了首长和同志们的好评。人民日报全文发表了“夜逛千亩田”。
    1959年10月，领导上给了上岳城水库的任务，别提我心里多高兴啦。能去参加这样大的工程，能为驯服漳河的英雄演唱，是很光荣的。并且，我还可以熟悉一下修大型水库的生活。这也是我学习的好机会。出发时，领导就告诉我，去后要认真地深入生活，回来时一定要交作品。我愉快地接受了这个任务。一到水库工地党委非常重视和支持我的工作，给我介绍水库的情况和典型的英雄事迹。起先他们叫我住招待所。招待所里住的人，多数是到水库来学习的、参观的和办公的。我一琢磨，这地方可不是深入生活的地方。第二天便和我的伴奏搬到工棚和民工住到一块了！未到水库以前，自己老怕写不出段子来。谁知往工棚一住，和民工们同吃同住同劳动，听到的，见到的，应该反映的题材，多得数都数不过来，感动得我一面写一面唱，老怕唱不完。十七天，我就编唱了五个工地上的段子。这五个段子不但受到民工同志们的欢迎，而且还都在刊物上发表了。
    我所做的工作，比起工农业战线上同志们所做的成绩还差的多，干劲也差的远。可是党和大家伙都鼓励我，说我是“曲艺界的红旗手”、“曲艺界的标兵”。我明白，这是党和同志们对我的培养和鼓励。我，一个文化水平挺低的曲艺艺人，能干出个什么来呢？这几年来，我深深体会到，依靠党依靠群众，才能做好工作；站稳无产阶级立场，才能正确地分析事物，处理题材；努力学习毛主席的著作，才能提高自己的政治思想水平；不断地深入生活，投入火热的生产斗争中去，才能写出适合劳动人民口味的好作品来。我听到有个别人说什么“上山下乡，配合中心任务会损伤艺术，会降低艺术质量”、“多快就不能好省”。我决不相信这些说法。因为两年来全国出现无数的优秀节目，完全说明了这些说法是错误的。配合中心任务既能多快也能好省。我个人对这事已经有了亲身的体会。不过我做的这一点点工作还十分不够。这只不过是我遵循了党的教导，接受了群众的帮助，用笔和嘴反映了现实生活中无数英雄、模范事迹的一点一滴而已。今后我要戒骄戒躁，鼓更大的干劲，努力学习马克思列宁主义和毛主席的著作，争取在1960年做出更大的成绩，来回答党和人民对我的鼓励。我一定要进一步发挥“尖兵”作用，紧密地配合政治任务，创作出更多更好的作品来，向伟大的中国共产党诞生四十周年献礼。
