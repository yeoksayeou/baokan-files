Xinhua News Agency, June 11th, Washington Dispatch: News of U.S. President's Press Secretary Hagerty being surrounded by angry Japanese patriotic masses at Tokyo Airport on the 10th has caused a shock in Washington. White House Acting Press Secretary Whetton told a press conference that Eisenhower "felt uneasy" about the situation.

The White House spokesman said that Hagerty, after escaping from the airport, immediately reported the "airport incident" to the White House by telephone. The White House Records Secretary, Goodpaster, promptly informed Eisenhower about this matter as soon as he woke up.

When a reporter asked whether Eisenhower was surprised to hear the news, Mrs. Whetton said, "He (Eisenhower) certainly felt uneasy."

A reporter asked whether Eisenhower would still go to Japan in view of Hagerty's embarrassing encounter. The White House spokesman replied, "As far as I know, the plan has not changed."

However, Hagerty's experience in Tokyo has caused the U.S. ruling clique to once again descend into confusion and argument over Eisenhower's trip to Japan. Several important senators have expressed doubts as to whether Eisenhower's visit to Japan is "wise." However, other figures, such as Senator Jackson, while admitting that the Hagerty incident "presents a serious problem" to the White House, worry that cancelling the visit would have "unthinkable consequences" for America's "allies" in the Far East.

After the Hagerty incident, Eisenhower held a three-quarter-hour meeting with Herter.

    哈格蒂被轰　华盛顿震动
    艾森豪威尔“感到不安”但仍要去日
    新华社11日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统新闻秘书哈格蒂10日在东京机场遭到愤怒的日本爱国群众包围的消息在华盛顿引起震动。白宫代理新闻秘书惠吞夫人在记者招待会上说，艾森豪威尔对这种局势“感到不安”。
    白宫的发言人说，哈格蒂在逃出机场之后立刻用电话向白宫报告了“机场事件的经过”，而白宫的文牍秘书古德帕斯特在艾森豪威尔刚刚睡醒的时候就连忙把这件事情告诉了他。
    有记者问，艾森豪威尔听到这个消息是否感到吃惊，惠吞夫人说：“他（艾森豪威尔）当然感到不安。”
    有记者问道，鉴于哈格蒂的狼狈遭遇，艾森豪威尔是否仍然要去日本。白宫发言人回答说：“据我所知，计划没有改变。”
    然而，哈格蒂在东京的遭遇使得美国统治集团在艾森豪威尔日本之行的问题上再度发生混乱和争吵。好几个重要的参议员都对艾森豪威尔访问日本是否“明智上表示怀疑。但是另外一些人物如参议员杰克逊虽然承认哈格蒂事件给白宫“提出了一个严重的问题”，不过他担心，如果取消访问，就会对美国在远东的“盟国”产生“不堪设想的影响”。
    在哈格蒂事件发生以后，艾森豪威尔同赫脱会谈了三刻钟。
