Learning from Jin Yuji
Taiyuan City Wuyi Road Primary School Teacher Zhang Xiuyuan

    In the flames of the Northeast Anti-Japanese War, an ordinary Korean woman, Jin Yuji, appeared before our eyes. She put on the uniform of the guerrillas and fought alongside her husband, not only trekking through mountains and rivers like a man, enduring all kinds of hardships, but also excellently completing the combat missions assigned by the Party. Isn't this the true nature of a proletarian revolutionary fighter? When the situation changed and the Party needed her to go underground, she stepped forward without hesitation. In her work, her ability to organize the masses, mobilize the masses, and integrate with the masses embodies the working method of the mass line that Chairman Mao often taught us, doesn't it?
    Her husband unfortunately sacrificed in battle, and she herself was captured and executed by the enemy due to the betrayal of a traitor. At various critical junctures, the heroine showed her ability to grit her teeth, instantly transform her grief into strength, and generously dedicate her life to the great Party and the great revolutionary cause. "I am not so easy to die." How powerful this sentence is! Isn't it the common heroic declaration of unyielding people?
    For the victory of the revolution, for the cause of communism, she advanced forever, towards the lighthouse pointed out by the Party. The struggle also made her stronger and stronger. She said to Li Da Niang's son, the young guerrilla - Xiao Lizi: "A revolutionary, after defeating Japan, must still fight for the cause of communism!" "You must learn well from the captain and be a brave and strong revolutionary fighter." Aren't these words giving us ideological education in revolutionary heroism? Holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, "bravely and strongly fighting for the cause of communism," this is precisely the "motto" that Jin Yuji helped me summarize ideologically forever.

    学习金玉姬
    太原市五一路小学女教师  张秀媛
    在东北抗日战争的烽火中，一位普通的朝鲜族妇女金玉姬出现在我们眼前。她穿起游击队的军装和丈夫并肩作战，不但和男人一样跋山涉水，受尽千辛万苦，而且能够出色地完成党所交给的战斗任务。这不正是无产阶级革命战士的本色吗？当形势变化，党需要她转入地下工作时，她毫不犹豫地挺身而出，在工作中她那样善于组织群众，发动群众和群众打成一片的所作所为，不正是体现毛主席经常教导我们的走群众路线的工作方法吗？
    丈夫在战斗中不幸牺牲了，在叛徒的陷害下自己又被敌人抓去处死。在各种紧要关头，女英雄所表现的是咬紧牙关，把万分悲痛顿时化为力量，慷慨不屈地把生命献给伟大的党，伟大的革命事业。“我不是那么容易死的。”这句话多么有力量，不正是不屈的人们通常的豪言壮语吗？
    为了革命的胜利，为了共产主义的事业，她永远向前，朝着党所指给的灯塔前进。斗争也使她越来越坚强了。她向李大娘的儿子、小游击队员——小李子，说：“一个革命者，打败了日本还要为共产主义事业而奋斗！”“你要好好学习队长，做一个勇敢的坚强的革命战士。”这些话不就是在向我们进行革命英雄主义的思想教育吗？高举毛泽东思想的红旗，“勇敢，坚强地为共产主义事业而奋斗”，这正是金玉姬帮助我在思想上概括的一条永远的“座右铭”。
