Everywhere in the remote mountain valleys, blossoms of preschool education bloom.

I am Zhang Guangyu, a teacher and a gardener in the Julong Commune Kindergarten in Guzhang County, Hunan Province, and I am a Tujia person.

In the mountains of Guzhang County, Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, since communization, kindergartens have been established in every village. The flowers of preschool education are blooming everywhere, enabling women to work as early and late as men, going up the mountains and down to the fields. The children live happily in the kindergartens, each well-educated, clever, lively, chubby, and healthy. Our kindergarten is one of them. I went through a period of ideological struggle when I first started working in the kindergarten. In September 1958, the Julong Commune was established, and the Party Committee considered establishing kindergartens universally to liberate women's labor force. On September 7, it was officially decided to establish the first kindergarten in the entire commune and county. The Commune Party Committee also decided to transfer me from the Youth Collective Farm to work in the kindergarten.

When I received the notice, I tossed and turned in bed all night, wondering what a kindergarten was all about. I remembered what a female commune member, Tian Sanmei, said to me during the day: "A kindergarten is just for leading children, and you, so young, are going to lead children, wipe their bottoms, and do the work of an old woman!" Should I go or not? My mind was in a fierce struggle, more turbulent than a pot of boiling water. I thought: A senior elementary school graduate, vice chairman of the farm… such a young person leading children… But I am a Communist Party member, can I disobey the leadership of the Party? And I remembered how solemnly I raised my right hand under the Party flag when I joined the Party. The past flashed before my eyes like a movie. Since graduating from senior elementary school in 1956, I happily participated in agricultural production. Later, I became the director of the credit cooperative. When the Youth Collective Farm was established, I was the first to sign up and, together with a group of young people, started from scratch to establish a collective farm in the mountains, and served as the vice chairman of the farm. In 1957, I was honored to attend the Provincial Conference of Rural Intellectual Youth Activists in Building Socialism. In the first half of 1958, I gloriously joined the Party. I thought of the past, and because I always listened to the Party and followed the Party, I did not go wrong. So, I made up my mind that whatever work the Party assigned, I would do it, and I would do it well.

The next day, I went to report to the commune office. At that time, Tian Zuyou, the general branch secretary of the Gaoqiao Brigade, joked to me: "Zhang Guangyu! Congratulations, congratulations, you've become a child's mother!" I blushed when I heard this, and I didn't dare to look up when I walked down the street, afraid of seeing acquaintances. The Commune Party Committee Secretary and the Women's Federation Director, Comrade Wu Shunying, found me immediately and talked to me, and introduced me to some books about preschool education. When I saw what Chairman Liu Shaoqi said, "Taking care of children should be more important than managing tractors and water pumps," I thought for a long time. At the same time, I remembered that some women often complained to me about the difficulty of participating in production, meetings, and cultural studies while dragging their children with them. Some, although they participated in production, had no one to take care of their children. Some were burned, scalded, or even drowned in the water. If children could be taken care of, women could happily participate in production and make production even greater. How good would that be! And isn't the establishment of kindergartens now solving these problems? If it weren't for the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, if it weren't for the People's Commune, how could we propose to establish kindergartens in this remote mountain valley! This work of wiping bottoms and leading children, though ordinary and unremarkable, is so meaningful. I finally happily accepted the task and enthusiastically devoted myself to the work of the kindergarten.

Rely on the Masses, Run the Kindergarten Diligently and Frugally

My work in the kindergarten was not smooth sailing. I encountered many difficulties in running the kindergarten. When the kindergarten was first opened, it was still using a classroom borrowed from the elementary school, and there was nothing else. The Commune Party Committee instructed that we should rely on the masses and run the kindergarten diligently and frugally. So, I went to the commune and government offices to collect unused posters and pictures to decorate the room neatly and beautifully. There were no stools in the kindergarten, so I mobilized the parents to borrow stools. But the borrowed stools were still not enough. So, I and the other caregivers used long boards on bricks as benches, with heights suitable for the children's physical development. Therefore, the children liked them very much.

The kindergarten gradually improved, and the number of children increased from more than twenty to more than sixty. The parents also requested that the children have meals in the kindergarten. There were so many children, but there were no cooking utensils or tableware. What should we do? Buy them with money? The commune was just established, where could we get so much money? We should still rely on the masses and follow the mass line. I went to the east family and the west family to mobilize the parents to support us. In this way, buckets, water tanks, pots, shovels, rice bowls, and dining tables were all voluntarily sent to the kindergarten by the commune members without spending a penny. With the support of the commune and the parents, we quickly built a stove.

The children are so innocent and lively, and everyone loves toys. But the kindergarten lacked toys. To solve the toy problem, I went to department stores and stationery stores to collect many cardboard boxes for packing goods, and also went to government offices to collect small pieces of wood, scraps of cloth, and cotton to make cloth dolls, cars, building blocks, and use clay to make fruits, dyed in various colors, diverse and beautiful. Now, we have made dozens of kinds of toys, reaching several hundred pieces.

In running the kindergarten, I always adhere to the principle of running the kindergarten diligently and frugally, and try to consider how to spend less money and use less labor to do more things and do them well. When the weather turned cold in winter, we built a safe heating pit ourselves for the children to keep warm. There was no charcoal. Although the brigade prepared to arrange a laborer to burn charcoal for the kindergarten, I saw that the commune members were busy with the three-management movement of managing mountains, managing water, and managing soil. A laborer was worth a thousand gold, so I decided not to have the brigade withdraw a laborer, but to arrange the work in the kindergarten well, and have one person go to the mountain to burn fuzz charcoal every day. Last winter, we burned as much as three thousand catties of fuzz charcoal, saving the brigade more than one hundred and twenty yuan in charcoal expenses.

In order to let the children eat their fill, eat well, and improve their lives, our staff planted several acres of vegetables, planted a lot of pumpkins, and raised a fat pig. At the same time, we went to the mountains to cut firewood. Since November of last year, we have cut tens of thousands of catties of firewood, reducing the expenses on firewood and vegetables. The children's living expenses have been reduced from four yuan per month to two yuan and five jiao. Moreover, they eat very well. The children have three meals a day, with two dishes and one soup for each meal. The rice is sometimes hard and sometimes thin, with rice tofu and also Baba, which are often mixed and eaten. During the New Year and holidays, they eat even more lavishly, and their lives are good. The children are all growing up chubby and strong. The food has improved, and money has been saved. From August of last year to March of this year, we have saved the brigade a total of more than one thousand two hundred yuan. Running the kindergarten diligently and frugally has blossomed and borne fruit.

Auntie is Better Than One's Own Parents

"Taking care of children should be more important than managing tractors and water pumps." This sentence has been firmly engraved in my mind. From more than a year of work, I have deeply realized that if the children are not taken care of well, it will affect production. The children are the future of the motherland and the builders of communism. Therefore, we must treat the children like our own younger siblings.

When the kindergarten was first established, some parents were not at ease, and some children were not used to the kindergarten life and were unwilling to come to the kindergarten. Those who came to the kindergarten also cried and screamed, clamoring to go home all day long. So, we went to each house every day to pick them up, and sent them home one by one in the evening. The commune member Li Zuyou's child, Li Zeling, was unwilling to come to the kindergarten. Every day after the child left the kindergarten, I would go to her house to play, gradually establishing a relationship with Li Zeling. Later, Li Zeling finally came to the kindergarten, and she didn't want to go home all day long. We paid attention to cultivating the children's habits of loving cleanliness and paying attention to hygiene. When we saw that their faces were covered with snot, we would fetch water to wash them clean. When we saw that their hair was messy, we would comb it and tie it with a bow. If the children's clothes were dirty, we would wash them clean. Because of this, the parents reflected that "the kindergarten is the child's home, and the kindergarten teacher is the child's own mother." The children like the kindergarten, and the parents are also at ease to send their children to the kindergarten. Therefore, the number of children enrolled in the kindergarten quickly increased from more than twenty to more than two hundred.

Making it convenient and beneficial for the people, taking good care of the children, teaching them well, and making the parents feel at ease in production, is what we are thinking about at all times. Some parents, because they have to go out or go up the mountain, can also temporarily board their children in the kindergarten. The commune member Wang Zhengyou had to go to Longbizui, more than fifty miles away, to do half a month of transportation work, so he put his child in the kindergarten. This child was not in good health, and he would wet the bed four or five times every night. Sometimes, he would wet his own quilt, but he had no complaints. I feel that being able to do more for the parents is my greatest comfort and happiness.

In my mind, I am always thinking about the children. Usually, I pay special attention to children's health care. If I find that a child is sick, I will go to the doctor in time. Sometimes, if a child is sick at home, I will often go to see him. The child Wu Qingliang was seriously ill and hospitalized. I would go to see him several times a day and bring brown sugar. The parent Zhang Shimei was moved to tears and said: "Teacher Zhang cares for the children more than her own parents. Open your eyes and take a look at your Teacher Zhang!"

Nothing is Difficult in the World if One Sets One's Mind to It

"Nothing is difficult in the world if one sets one's mind to it." I always use this sentence to encourage myself in the face of difficulties.

At first, I was a novice in managing and teaching children. The children cried and made noise, and I couldn't think of a good way, so I just closed the door tightly. Some children even ran home. I realized that this method would not work, and I had to manage and teach them with new ideas and new methods. So, on the one hand, I asked Teacher Wu Gongying, who had worked as a kindergarten teacher in the elementary school, for advice. On the other hand, I went to the bookstore to buy books on educating young children to study. I was not very good at singing and dancing, and I usually didn't like to sing and dance. However, when I thought about the task assigned by the Party, cultivating the flowers of the motherland, I had to learn even if I couldn't. So, I looked for short and simple children's songs, humming them wherever I went, humming them until I was familiar with them, and then asking the elementary school teacher if they were correct. Sometimes, I practiced until late at night, and I was still practicing in bed, often falling asleep unconsciously. The next day, before the children came to the kindergarten, I practiced the basic movements of singing and dancing in the yard. In this way, I slowly learned to sing and dance. Now, not only can I sing and dance, but I can also write my own short and simple songs and dances! In the past year or so, I have also written more than twenty children's songs and dances, and more than fifty stories. At the same time, I always insist on studying one or two articles on preschool education every night and learn to write lesson plans. The kindergarten life is very regular. And set up music, painting, language, sports and other courses, the teaching methods are diverse, closely linked to production, combined with the central work, such as during the Great Leap Forward in steelmaking, they took the children to visit the commune's steelmaking, organized children's costume performances to promote, children holding small red flags and shouting "Long live the general line", "Long live the Great Leap Forward", "Long live the people's commune." In the rush to harvest, they organized children to select tea seeds, which strongly supported production, strengthened ideological education for the children, and each child was educated to be both smart and lively, polite, and laid a good foundation for entering elementary school.

In order to do a good job in the kindergarten's health care work, I often went to the hospital to ask for advice. It was not easy to learn hygiene and epidemic prevention knowledge and technology. At the beginning of learning BCG vaccination, I was always unable to grasp the dosage. So, I put empty bottles filled with water by my side, and practiced whenever I had time, and finally learned it. At the same time, I also learned the prevention methods for various seasonal epidemics, and vaccination. I can prevent various seasonal epidemics in time.

To run the kindergarten well, we must rely on the collective strength of all the staff and give full play to everyone's active role. Therefore, we must also help them continuously improve their political and professional level. I organized several caregivers into study groups, concentrated on studying every night, exchanged work experience, and taught them some of the things I had learned. Because of this, the other four kindergarten teachers in the kindergarten are also basically familiar with their business. Usually, I pay close attention to the ideological dynamics of the staff in the kindergarten, strengthen political and ideological work. If I find any problems, I will talk to them. Some kindergarten teachers want to enter factories, some want to go to school, and sometimes they waver when they encounter difficulties. On the one hand, I helped them solve practical difficulties, on the other hand, I used my own experience to persuade them, unite and educate all the kindergarten teachers, establish everyone's sense of career, and work actively.

It is not enough to run our own kindergarten well. I always hope that all the kindergartens in our commune can be run well, so that women can feel at ease in production and children can receive a certain education. Therefore, I also took the initiative to organize the kindergarten teachers of the eight kindergartens in SiYuanqiao, Gaoqiao, and Hongxing brigades, and concentrated on studying every Saturday night, and also carried out mutual competitions. When I came back from the provincial conference of heroes, I saw that more than twenty children in the Hongshaxi production team of the Hongxing Brigade were not organized to enter the kindergarten. They ran around in the mountains and fields all day long, fighting and quarreling. This place was also close to the road and the river, which was very unsafe. The parents were often worried about their children when they were producing. I contacted the team branch, and although the kindergarten was established, the kindergarten teacher Yang Qingying was not familiar with her work and could not control the children. Only more than ten children came to the kindergarten every day. She also felt distressed and did not want to do it anymore. It was in danger of collapsing. If it was established, it could not be allowed to collapse. So, I took five days to help her in the Hongshaxi Kindergarten. I saw that each child was covered in mud and dirt, with thick dirt on their clothes. I took advantage of a sunny day to take the children to the river to play, and washed their dirty clothes and dried them before putting them on. The children returned home clean, and the parents were all smiles, praising them repeatedly. Under the urging of the parents, all the more than twenty children came to the kindergarten again on the fifth day.

In the past year or so, under the leadership of the Party and with the support of the masses, we have done some work and achieved some results, but we are not satisfied with the existing achievements. We must continue to revolutionize and move forward bravely. All the staff of our kindergarten have made new plans and created greater achievements. Now, all the staff of our kindergarten love this work more and more. If anyone asks me, what work do you like to do the most, I will firmly answer: "I want to be red in the kindergarten, expert in the kindergarten, and let my hair turn white in the kindergarten."

    红在幼儿园　专在幼儿园
    湖南省古丈县巨龙公社幼儿园教师　张光玉
    大山沟处处盛开幼儿教育之花
    我是湖南古丈县巨龙公社幼儿园的一个园丁，是土家族人。
    在湘西土家族苗族自治州古丈县的万山丛中，公社化以来村村都办起了幼儿园，处处盛开着幼儿教育之花，妇女们都能和男子一样，早出晚归，上山下田，孩子在园里幸福的生活着，个个教养得聪明活泼，肥肥胖胖。我们幼儿园就是其中的一个。我参加幼儿园工作有过一段思想斗争过程。1958年9月，巨龙公社成立了，党委就考虑要普遍建立幼儿园，解放妇女劳动力，9月7日，正式决定办起全公社也是全县的第一所幼儿园，公社党委并确定把我从青年集体农庄调到幼儿园去工作。
    当我接到通知后，一夜辗转在床上翻来复去地想，到底幼儿园是搞什么的呢？记起白天女社员田三妹对我说的：“幼儿园就是给人引伢儿，你年纪轻轻的给人引伢儿，揩屎倒尿，干老婆婆的事呀！”到底去不去呢？思想在激烈地斗争着，脑子里比一锅子开水还要翻腾得厉害，我想：一个高小毕业生，农庄副主席……，年轻轻的引伢儿去……，但我是一个共产党员，能不服从党的领导？并记得自己在入党时是如何庄重地举起右手在党旗下向党宣誓的，往事就像电影一样一幕一幕地在我眼前闪过。我自从1956年高小毕业后，就愉快地参加了农业生产，后来，当上了信用社主任，建立青年集体农庄时，我首先报名和一群年青人一道，白手起家，在高山上建立起集体农庄，并担任了农庄副主席，1957年光荣地出席了全省农村知识青年建设社会主义积极分子大会，1958年上半年光荣地入了党。我想到过去的一段，由于自己处处听党的话，跟着党走，才没有错，于是下定决心，党分配的工作，不管什么，都要去干，而且要坚决干好。
    第二天，我就到公社办公室去报到。当时，高?桥大队总支书田祖佑向我开玩笑说：“张光玉呀！恭喜恭喜，当上伢儿娘了”，我听了不觉脸一红，走到街上也不敢抬头，怕见熟人。公社党委书记和妇联主任吴顺英同志知道后，马上找我谈话，并介绍了一些有关幼教书籍给我看。当我看到刘少奇主席说的“管孩子应当比管拖拉机、抽水机还重要”时，想了很久很久，同时，记得平常总有些妇女向自己诉说拖儿带女不能参加生产、开会、学习文化的苦处，有的虽然参加生产，但孩子无人看管，有的被烧伤，烫伤，甚至掉进水里去活活被淹死，要是孩子都有人管，妇女们就都能愉快地参加生产，使生产能更大跃进，这该多好呀！而现在办幼儿园不正是解决这些问题的吗？要不是党和毛主席的领导，要不是有了人民公社，那能提出在这大山沟中办幼儿园啊！这揩屎倒尿引伢儿的工作，虽平凡无奇，但又多么有意义，我终于愉快地接受了任务，热情地投入了幼儿园的工作。
    依靠群众　勤俭办园
    我在幼儿园里工作并不是一帆风顺的，在办园中遇到了重重困难。幼儿园开办时，还是借用小学的一间房子，其他什么东西也没有，公社党委指示，要依靠群众，勤俭办园，于是我就到公社和机关去收集不用的挂图、画片，把房子布置得整洁美观，园里没有坐凳，我就发动家长借出坐凳，但借来的凳子仍不够用，我又和其他几个教养员们就用长板子架在砖上，当作板凳，高矮适合孩子的身体发育，因此，孩子们都很喜欢。
    幼儿园逐步办好了，孩子越来越多，由二十多个增加到六十多个，家长们又要求孩子们在园内开餐，幼儿这么多，而炊具、用具一样也没有，怎么办呢？花钱买吧，公社刚建立，哪来这么多钱，还是依靠群众，走群众路线。我又奔东家，走西家，发动家长支援，这样，水桶、水缸、锅、铲、饭钵、餐桌社员们都主动地送到了幼儿园，没花一文钱，用具样样都齐备了，在公社和家长支援下很快地砌起灶来了。
    孩子是那么天真活泼，个个喜爱玩具。但幼儿园缺乏玩具，为解决玩具问题，我便到百货商店、文具店，收集许多装货的纸盒，又到机关收集零碎木块、破布片、棉花，制成布娃娃、汽车、积木、用泥巴捏成水果，染上各种颜色，多样美观，现共制成了玩具几十种，达好几百件。
    在办园中我总是本着勤俭办园的原则，尽量考虑如何少花钱和少用劳力，达到多办事，办好事。冬天天气冷了，我们自己修了个安全烤火坑道给孩子们取暖，没有炭火，虽然大队准备安排一个劳力为幼儿园烧炭，但我看到当时社员们正是在大搞治山、治水、治土的三治运动，一个劳力值千金，就决定不要大队抽劳力，而把园内工作很好安排，每天抽出一个人来上山烧毛毛炭，去冬烧的毛毛炭就达三千斤，为大队节省了炭火开支一百二十多元。
    为了让孩子们吃饱吃好，改善生活，我们几个工作人员自己种了几亩菜，种了不少南瓜，喂养了一头肥猪，同时，上山砍柴，从去年11月以来，就砍了好几万斤柴，减少了柴菜开支，孩子生活费由以前每月四元，降到二元五角。并且，吃得很好，孩子每天三餐，每餐两菜一汤，饭有硬有稀，有米豆腐，也有粑粑，经常调配着吃，逢年过节，吃得更加丰盛，生活过得好，孩子都长得肥胖健壮。伙食改善了，钱也节约了，从去年8月到今年3月，先后共为大队节约达一千二百多元，勤俭办园开出了鲜花，结出了硕果。
        阿姨赛过亲爹娘
    “管孩子应当比管拖拉机、抽水机还要重要”这句话，已经牢牢地铭刻在我的心上。从一年多来的工作中我深深体会到，如果孩子稍一带得不好，就要影响生产，孩子是祖国的未来，是共产主义的建设者，因此对孩子要像对亲弟妹一样。
    初办园时，有的家长不放心，有的孩子不习惯园内生活，不肯来园，来园的也都哭哭叫叫，整天嚷着要回家。于是，我们就天天挨家挨户去接，晚上又一个个送回家，社员李祖佑的孩子李泽玲不肯来园，每天等孩子离园后，我就到她家去玩，渐渐地和李泽玲建立了感情，后来李泽玲终于进园了，一天到晚还不想回家。我们注意了培养孩子们爱清洁、讲卫生的习惯，见他鼻涕花脸的，就打水给他洗净，见头发蓬乱，就给梳好，打上蝴蝶结，孩子衣服脏了就洗得干干净净，由于这样，家长们反映说：“幼儿园就是孩子的家，幼师是孩子的亲妈妈”，孩子喜欢幼儿园，家长也放心把孩子送进园。因此入园的孩子由二十多个，很快就增加到二百多个。
    便民利民把孩子带好、教好、使家长安心生产，这是我们时时刻刻在考虑的问题。有的家长因要出外或上山，要求临时把孩子寄宿在园内也可以。社员王正友要到远离五十多里的龙鼻嘴去搞半个月搬运劳动，他就把孩子放到幼儿园，这孩子身体不太好，每晚给他把四、五次尿。有时让孩子把自己的花被单尿湿了也毫无怨言。我感到能多给家长们作点事就是我最大的安慰和幸福。
    在我脑子里时刻想着的就是孩子，平常我特别注意儿童的卫生保健，发现孩子有病，就及时就医，有时孩子在家病了，我就不时的去看，孩子吴庆良病重住院，我一天要去看他几次，还带去红糖，家长张世妹感动得流下泪来说：“张老师关心孩子赛过亲爹娘，你快睁开眼来看一看你们的张老师呀！”
    世上无难事，只怕有心人
    “世上无难事，只怕有心人”，我在困难面前总是用这句话鼓励自己。
    起初，对管教孩子我还是个生手，孩子哭哭闹闹，想不出好办法，只是把门关得紧紧的，有的孩子还偏跑回家，我认识到，这个办法不行，必须以新的思想，新的方法管教他们。于是，我一方面请教小学曾搞过幼师工作的吴恭英老师，一方面，到书店买有关教育幼儿的书籍进行学习。我不大会唱歌、跳舞，并且平时也不爱跳跳唱唱，但是，一想到这是党交给的任务，培养祖国的花朵，不会也得学会，于是，我就找短浅的幼儿歌曲，走到那里，哼到那里，哼熟了再去请教小学老师看对不对，有时一直练习到深夜，睡在被窝里也还在练习，往往不知不觉的睡着了。第二天天未亮，趁着孩子未来园，我又在院子里练音和舞蹈的基本动作。就这样，慢慢地学会了唱歌跳舞了，现在不单会唱会跳，还能自编短浅的歌曲和舞蹈哩！一年多来，我还自编了幼儿歌曲和舞蹈二十多个，故事五十多个，同时，我每晚总要坚持学习一两篇有关幼儿教育的文章，学会编写教案。园内生活很有规律。并设了音乐、图画、语言、体育等几门课，教育方法多种多样，紧密地结合生产，结合中心工作，如在大炼钢铁时，就带孩子参观公社炼钢，组织幼儿化装表演宣传，小朋友举着小红旗高呼“总路线万岁”、“大跃进万岁”、“人民公社万岁”。在抢收中，组织孩子选茶子，有力地支援了生产，加强了对幼儿的思想教育，孩子个个教养得既聪明又活泼，有礼貌，为进入小学打下了良好的基础。
    为了把园内卫生保健工作搞好，我又常去医院请教。要学习卫生防疫知识和技术不是很容易的，学种卡介苗开始时总是不能掌握剂量，我就用空瓶子装上水放在身边，一有空就练习，终于学会了。同时还学会了各个季节各种流行疾病的预防方法，打防预针，对于各个季节流行疾病都能及时预防。
    要把幼儿园办好，必须依靠全园工作人员的集体力量，发挥每个人的积极作用，因而也就要帮助他们不断提高政治、业务水平。我把几个教养员组织了学习小组，每晚集中学习，交流工作经验，并把自己所学的一些东西都教给他们。由于这样，园内其他四个幼师也基本熟悉了业务，平时我很注意园内工作人员的思想动态，加强政治思想工作，发现有什么问题，就找他们谈心，有的幼师想进工厂，有的想升学，有时遇到困难就动摇不定，我一方面帮助她们解决实际困难，一方面就用自己的体会说服他们，团结教育全体幼师，树立大家的事业心，积极地工作。
    光把自己这所幼儿园办好还不行，我总希望我们全公社的幼儿园都能办好，使妇女们安心生产，孩子们受到一定教育。因此，我还主动地把思源桥、高?、红星等大队的八所幼儿园幼师组织起来，每星期六晚上集中进行学习，并且相互开展竞赛。当我从省里开群英会回来后，看到红星大队红沙溪生产队有二十多个孩子未组织进园，整天在山野里跑、打架吵架，这里又近公路和河道，很不安全，家长生产时常记挂着小孩，我和该队支部联系，虽把这个园办起来了，但幼师杨清英工作不熟悉，管不住孩子，每天到园只有十多个，她也感到苦恼，并不愿再搞了，眼看就有垮掉的危险。办起来了就不能让它垮下去。于是我就抽了五天的时间，到红沙溪幼儿园去帮助她，见孩子一个个弄得花脸泥脚污手，衣服上的灰垢厚厚的，就趁一个大晴天，一面带孩子到河边去游玩，一面把他们脏衣服脱下洗好晒干给穿上。孩子个个洗得干干净净回到家里，家长见了个个喜笑颜开，连连称赞，在家长的督促下，第五天二十多个孩子又全部到了园。
    一年多来，在党的领导和群众的支持下，我们虽做了一点工作，取得了一点成绩，但决不满足现有成绩，我们要不断革命，勇猛前进。我们全园工作人员已作出了新的规划，创造更大的成绩。现在我们全园的工作人员越来越热爱这一工作了，如果谁要问我，你最喜爱干什么工作，我将坚定的回答：“我要红在幼儿园，专在幼儿园，让青发白在幼儿园。”
