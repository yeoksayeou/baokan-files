Shanghai: Promoting New Technologies and Experiences, Quality and Variety Catch Up with Open Hearth Furnaces

(By our correspondent from Shanghai, June 26) In the ongoing battle to seize steel, Shanghai converter steelmaking workers have further tightened the technical transformation of pig iron furnaces and widely promoted the advanced experiences and new technologies of converter steelmaking, achieving good results in ensuring high converter output, high quality, and low consumption.

At the beginning of this year, Shanghai's converter steelmaking workers set ambitious goals to make the variety and quality of steel catch up with and surpass that of open hearth furnaces while continuing to use high-sulfur pig iron to make good steel.

After the steel seizure battle began in June, Shanghai's converter steelmaking workers, while continuing to promote advanced experiences, first concentrated their efforts on tackling the melting process of pig iron furnaces, trying every means to increase the pig iron output of pig iron furnaces and ensure that converters receive high-quality iron with high quantity.

In order to increase pig iron output, all factories are currently deeply mobilizing the masses, vigorously carrying out high air pressure and large air volume operations, and focusing on the construction of hot blast stoves, and have also carried out a series of work on the quality of pig iron furnace masonry and material yard management. After the promotion of full air and sufficient pressure operation on the pig iron furnace of the No. 3 converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1, the pig iron output per hour reached 21.8 tons, an increase of more than 90% compared to before the use of large air volume.

In the process of promoting new experiences and technologies, leading cadres of various factories have successively conducted experimental furnaces together with workers and technicians, and insisted on fully promoting some effective advanced experiences into production. Due to the adoption of these measures, at present, the pig iron furnaces in some converter workshops in the city have reached the requirements of long service life, high pig iron temperature, fast melting speed, and good desulfurization effect. The pig iron output per hour of many pig iron furnaces has reached or exceeded the design capacity of the equipment, ensuring the continuous increase in converter steel production.

Tianjin: Establishing a Furnace Life Committee to Formulate a Converter Longevity Plan

(By our correspondent from Tianjin, June 26) Leading cadres of Tianjin No. 3 Steel Plant went deep into the furnace front, established a specialized organization in the form of "three combinations," headed by the Party Committee Secretary, formulated a plan to ensure converter longevity, and focused on converter furnace life. In the first six days of mid-June, the average furnace life of converters increased from 23.9 heats in the first ten days of the month to 34 heats. The new five-ton converter also created a new record of continuous steelmaking for 63 heats without baking the furnace, and the daily production level of steel ingots increased sharply by 36.5% compared with the first ten days of the month.

At the beginning of June, after a major overhaul, the plant established a "three-combination" furnace life committee headed by the Party Committee Secretary, and formulated a plan to improve furnace life. Leading cadres of the plant went deep into the furnace front, participated in production, directed production, and focused on the three key factors affecting furnace life: pig iron furnaces, furnace repair, and steelmaking, so that the furnace life of converters rapidly increased. On the 13th, when the furnace life reached 47 heats, the lower interface leaked. At that time, some people thought, "It's over, we can't smelt any more." At this time, the Party Committee Secretary called on everyone to find ways to seize higher furnace life and strive for higher output. Song Yuzhang, the workshop director who came from an old worker's background, immediately made a detailed analysis from a technical point of view, and then worked with the furnace repair team leader and steelmaking workers to quickly solve the problem of steel leakage at the lower interface. Then, they successively created new records of 53 heats and 63 heats.

Changchun: Attack Teams Vigorously Attack the "Lifespan" Barrier of Pig Iron Furnaces

(By our correspondent from Changchun, June 26) Since mid-May, the steel front in Changchun has successively organized fourteen "three-combination" attack teams focusing on extending the life of pig iron furnaces, greatly extending the life of pig iron furnaces. At present, the average furnace life of 80% of the city's pig iron furnaces has reached 140 hours, doubling that of early May.

Changchun's steel industry was established in a relatively short period of time. In the past, the life of pig iron furnaces was generally around 70 hours. Due to the long furnace repair time, bottom-freezing accidents often occurred due to low temperature. In order to improve this situation, the Changchun Metallurgical Bureau organized an advanced experience promotion team for "long life" pig iron furnaces in mid-May, and widely disseminated advanced experience. Subsequently, each steel plant also successively organized fourteen attack teams composed of cadres, technicians, and workers. After each attack team "investigated key issues" and "found the source of the disease," they finally found four key problems affecting the "long life" of pig iron furnaces. These are: small furnace hearth, excessively long furnace cooling water nozzles, large gaps in furnace masonry, and short life of the iron crossing bridge. In response to these four key issues, each steel plant carried out comprehensive technical transformations on the existing pig iron furnaces, resulting in a significant increase in furnace life.

At present, all steel industry workers in Changchun are working harder and are determined to resolutely break through the 200-hour mark for pig iron furnaces in a short period of time and achieve "long life" for furnace life.

Jiangxi: Increased Pig Iron Furnace Life, Improved Converter Furnace Life

(By our correspondent from Nanchang, June 26) Workers on the steelmaking front in Jiangxi Province, with great enthusiasm, fought fiercely in June, attacking the barrier of furnace lining life, resulting in a large increase in the life of pig iron furnaces, a large increase in the life of small converters, a steady increase in steel production, and a general reduction in iron and coke ratios.

According to statistics from the first ten days of June, the smelting time of pig iron furnaces throughout the province generally increased by more than 20 hours compared with the past. The average furnace life of small converters increased from 17 heats in the past to 25 heats, and steel production increased by 14.9% compared with the same period in early May. Pig iron consumption decreased by about 12% compared with the past, and coal and coke consumption also achieved a great reduction.

At present, the steelmaking front workers throughout the province are advancing victoriously, continuing to improve the life of furnace linings, and striving for a greater leap forward in steel production in June.

Lanzhou: Grasping Hot Air and Breaking Low Temperatures to Seize Steel from Furnace Life

(By our correspondent from Lanzhou, June 26) Lanzhou Donggang Steel Plant actively improves the life of pig iron furnaces and the life of converters, reduces the consumption of pig iron and coke, rapidly increases production, and greatly improves the quality of converter steel.

In order to focus on converter furnace life, Donggang Steel Plant launched a major debate at the end of May centered on "Resisting Cold Air, Changing Climate, Grasping Hot Air, Breaking Low Temperatures, Fighting for Furnace Life, Ensuring High Output, Grasping Materials, and Eating Iron Mountain," and proposed the slogan of seizing steel from furnace life. Then, a comprehensive technical performance and production battle were launched. After the technical performance was launched, the furnace life of converters increased by more than double, and the output of steel also increased by two times. Through technical performance, the pig iron furnace created a method of rapid heating, shortening the heating time from three hours to half an hour, and the furnace life was more than doubled compared with the past.

Tangshan: Continuously Creating New Records for Using Pig Iron Furnaces for Ten Days and Nights

(By our correspondent) Workers at Tangshan Steel Plant have continuously created new records for using pig iron furnaces for ten days and nights, with furnace life of 250 heats, 300 heats, and 377 heats. The average furnace life of all pig iron furnaces in the plant reached 200 heats. Due to the increase in furnace life, the steel output of the entire plant has increased substantially. The average daily output in the first ten days of June increased by 20% compared with the last ten days of May. The daily output in mid-June increased by 13% compared with the first ten days of the month.

In order to seize the overproduction of steel ingots, the Party Committee of Tangshan Steel Plant analyzed the current production situation and believed that the main problems affecting the increase in steel output were the short life of pig iron furnaces, low furnace temperature, low melting rate, and high sulfur content in molten iron. In order to overcome these key points, the Party Committee proposed to solve the problem of short pig iron furnace life with the spirit of "tiger fighting."

The workers actively responded to the call of the Party Committee, and each pig iron furnace quickly launched a competition of "three highs" (high furnace temperature, high melting rate, high life) and "one low" (low sulfur content in molten iron). In the competition to encircle and suppress the short life of pig iron furnaces, the workers of this plant created the "seven-character method." These seven characters are: Strict, strictly implement operating procedures; Break, break the old habits of three-shift boundaries and stopping the blast during handover; Connect, keep in close contact and cooperate closely between shifts, between types of work, and between left and right; Check, check frequently; Poke, poke frequently to keep the tuyeres clear; Clean, discharge slag completely; Plug, plug early and plug well, and do not see slag when discharging iron. The implementation resulted in excellent results throughout the plant.
