The Young Pioneers are a School for Young Children to Learn Communism
Wang Wei, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League

With the continuous leap forward in our country's socialist construction, our country's education for young children has also achieved great success. The children's education network is rapidly forming. Nurseries and kindergartens have greatly developed, and the enrollment rate of school-age children is over 80%. Extracurricular education institutions are developing rapidly, and many extracurricular activity places have been established in some cities and rural areas. The Young Pioneer organization is growing stronger, with 50 million Young Pioneers nationwide. Since the Great Leap Forward, the publication of children's books has greatly increased. In 1958 and 1959, a total of 3,923 kinds of children's books were printed, with 153,486,000 copies.

In the past few years, under the leadership of the Party and inspired by the Great Leap Forward, the Young Pioneer organization has carried out a vigorous children's movement, achieved great results, and effectively promoted the growth of new communist qualities in young children. Since last winter and this spring, in conjunction with the nationwide socialist education movement, the Young Pioneers have widely carried out the education activity of "Long Live the Three Red Banners," achieving "every team has activities, everyone receives education," and a surge of talking about the Three Red Banners, singing songs of the Three Red Banners, and contributing to the Three Red Banners has appeared everywhere. The Young Pioneers have also widely carried out education activities to advance under the banner of Mao Zedong, studying the deeds of Chairman Mao leading the revolutionary struggle, and educating young children to listen to Chairman Mao and be good children of Chairman Mao. The Young Pioneers actively guide young children to participate in social activities within their capabilities, help socialist construction, and do good things for the collective. In 1959, young children across the country planted a total of 3 billion trees and harvested 170 million catties of oil crops such as sunflowers and castor beans. In the patriotic health movement, young children have become the most active propaganda team and assault team, all striving to be small pioneers in eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene. The Young Pioneers also vigorously guide young children to participate in productive labor within their capabilities. According to incomplete statistics, 490,000 small factories, 410,000 small farms, and many small breeding farms and nurseries have been established in primary schools across the country. Recently, in conjunction with the nationwide technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the Young Pioneers have more widely organized young children to carry out activities to learn science and technology. In Shanghai alone, 700,000 young children participated. Many Young Pioneers in Harbin primary schools above the third grade have learned to make crystal radios. These activities have enhanced the ideological feelings of young children in loving the Party, loving Chairman Mao, and loving socialism, cultivated their communist spirit of benefiting society from an early age, made young children love labor from an early age, regarding labor as the most glorious cause, inspired their revolutionary ambition to conquer the earth and transform the world in the future, and began to establish the lofty ideals of striving for the communist cause and the communist style of daring to think and act, becoming a new generation full of revolutionary vigor.

The achievement of these results is due to the leadership of the Party, the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, and the great victory of the Party's educational policy of serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor.

The Party has always advocated educating young children with the communist spirit, so that they can develop in an all-round way in moral, intellectual, and physical education, and cultivate them into laborers with socialist consciousness and culture. Therefore, we not only require young children to study hard in the classroom, but also actively guide them to participate in social and political life and productive labor within their capabilities, so that they can be influenced by the proletarian world outlook from an early age, learn cultural and scientific knowledge, and develop a strong physique.

Our education is to create proletarian fighters. The communist spirit cannot be cultivated from a static life. Therefore, we must guide young children to participate in political life from an early age, and we must influence young children with the images of revolutionary leaders and revolutionary heroes, and educate them with the facts of class struggle, so that they can be tempered in participating in socialist political life. Lenin said well: Without work, without struggle, then, obtaining bookish communist knowledge solely from communist pamphlets and works is worth less than a penny.

Under the leadership of the Party, our country's children's movement has been closely linked with the revolutionary struggle from the first day of its inception. Today's Young Pioneer organization has inherited this glorious revolutionary tradition, putting political and ideological work in the first place, and has achieved great results. The Young Pioneers guide young children to read books about revolutionary leaders and revolutionary struggles, commemorate revolutionary festivals, sweep the tombs of martyrs, and meet with heroic models, etc., and carry out many political and ideological education activities suitable for the characteristics of young children, so that they can receive profound socialist and communist education in the activities, be inspired by great ideals, and greatly stimulate the revolutionary spirit of "making progress every day" in young children. Everyone sets high aspirations and lofty ambitions. After carrying out the education activity of "Long Live Chairman Mao," the students of Guxiang Primary School in Luoyang City wrote poems praising Chairman Mao, saying: "Reversing the Yellow River with our feet, knocking down Mount Tai as a pillow, industry and agriculture leap forward together, surpassing England is not a worry." Political and ideological education has also greatly improved the learning consciousness of young children and established the concept of studying for the motherland. Facts have proved that conducting political and ideological education for young children and organizing young children to participate in social and political life is the fundamental work of cultivating new people and the basic experience of the Young Pioneer work. We must adhere to this correct direction.

Communist laborers must be cultivated in labor. Labor can make people aware, make people smart, and make people healthy. We should guide young children to participate in some productive labor within their capabilities from an early age, so that they can recognize the glory of labor from an early age, that there is no distinction between high and low in labor, and establish the concept of long live labor. The Young Pioneers have always paid attention to guiding young children to participate in appropriate productive labor, so that the children's movement is combined with the national production movement. In the past few years, the Young Pioneers have combined the actual situation of our country's socialist construction, selected facts that are educational for young children and within their capabilities to carry out productive labor activities, so that young children have acquired some production knowledge and skills, developed labor habits, cultivated ideological feelings of respecting working people, and established the idea of serving the people. Facts have proved that young children's participation in labor is important for their intellectual, physical, and ideological development. The Young Pioneers of Jingshi Street Primary School in Luoyang City, Henan Province, participated in the labor of small factories, and all learned to make single-tube radios, and could design their own circuit diagrams. They also made five-purpose radios that can receive radio, play records, etc. Their electrical knowledge far exceeds the level of ordinary primary school students. People with bourgeois ideas do not allow young children to be tempered in actual labor, but only let them study behind closed doors, eat ready-made meals, and enjoy ready-made blessings. This can only cultivate selfish, lazy, and cowardly people. This is contrary to our goal of cultivating new communist people. We resolutely oppose bourgeois educational ideas such as "free growth" and "ideology is intangible, classroom scores are real," adhere to the direction pointed out by the Party, and further organize young children to participate in productive labor and political and social activities within their capabilities, to create a new generation.

Widely carrying out scientific and technological activities among young children is a task with far-reaching significance. Today's young children are the reserve force of our country's scientific and technological team. We must inspire them to love science and aspire to climb the高峰 of science from an early age. There are also two different ideas in guiding young children to carry out scientific and technological activities: one is that as long as you learn the knowledge in the textbook, it will hinder learning to carry out scientific and technological activities. The other is that not only should we learn textbook knowledge, but we should also organize young children to carry out scientific and technological activities. At present, young children's scientific and technological activities have developed rapidly. They take extracurricular activity places and small factories and farms in schools as bases to carry out various scientific experiments and innovations. Automatic production lines have appeared in the small factories run by primary schools in Harbin, and the Young Pioneers of Shangta Primary School in Qingpu County, Shanghai, have learned a complete set of rabbit raising knowledge, and farmers nearby come to ask them to treat rabbits. Some young children, together with workers, extracted alcohol from fruit peels, extracted useful chemical medicines from sludge, and cultivated chlorella with human urine. The Young Pioneers of Qingtou Primary School in Shanxi Province planted a "three-story building" plant with tomatoes on the top, eggplants in the middle, and potatoes at the bottom, and cultivated red cotton. There is also a 13-year-old county scientific researcher in Jiangxi, who successfully crossed rice and sorghum and cultivated many new plant varieties. Facts have proved that the development of scientific and technological activities has further enhanced young children's desire for knowledge, and their knowledge has greatly exceeded the scope of textbooks. More importantly, it has increased the revolutionary ambition of young children. They said: "What the predecessors didn't think of, we must think of, and what doesn't exist in the world, we must create." These facts powerfully refute the bourgeois ideas that underestimate the strength of children and isolate book knowledge from scientific and technological activities. In order to better cultivate young children, we must vigorously carry out mass scientific and technological activities to arm them with the latest scientific achievements.

The communist education of young children should be mainly social education. Collectivism needs to be cultivated in the collective. Taking social education as the main focus is the characteristic of communist education. With the development of the people's commune movement, the majority of housewives have embarked on the posts of productive labor. Their ideological awareness has been increasing day by day, and they also urgently demand to gradually realize the socialization of the education of young children. Taking social education as the main focus will play an increasingly huge power in the communist education of young children, and will cultivate young children in our country into a new generation without selfishness and full of collectivist ideas. Of course, it does not mean that family education is not needed. Families also have the responsibility of educating their children, and they should educate their children with the communist spirit. This is also the responsibility that families should fulfill to society.

The Communist Youth League organizations should closely cooperate with relevant departments to run social education for children well, further strengthen the Young Pioneer work, and widely organize young children to participate in the activities of extracurricular education institutions.

Loving children and caring for children is a communist virtue. Young children are in the stage of growing up and gaining knowledge. We should care for the new generation with the spirit of communists, so that they can truly "have good health, good learning, and good work." We must adhere to the principle of combining work with rest for their study, work, and rest, and arrange them properly and comprehensively.

Under the cordial care and leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, great achievements have been made in the work of young children, and rich experience has been accumulated. Accelerating the cultivation of a new generation of communists is an arduous and glorious task. The future of our great motherland is brilliant and bright, and the future of our new generation is boundless. Let us hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and push the children's movement further forward.

    少年先锋队是少年儿童学习共产主义的学校
    中国共产主义青年团中央委员会书记处书记　王伟
    随着我国社会主义建设的不断跃进，我国的少年儿童教育事业也取得了伟大的成就。儿童教育网正在迅速形成。托儿所、幼儿园有了很大的发展，学龄儿童的入学率已在80％以上。校外教育机构正在迅速发展，有些城市和农村已经建立了不少的校外活动场所。少先队组织日益壮大，全国有少先队员五千万人。大跃进以来，儿童读物的出版有很大的增长。1958、1959两年共印行儿童读物三千九百二十三种、一亿五千三百四十八万六千册。
    几年来，少先队组织在党的领导下，在大跃进形势的鼓舞下，开展了蓬蓬勃勃的少年儿童运动，取得了很大的成绩，有力地促进了少年儿童共产主义新品质的成长。去冬今春以来，结合全民社会主义教育运动，少先队广泛开展了“三面红旗万万岁”的教育活动，做到了“队队有活动，人人受教育”，出现了到处讲三面红旗的事、唱三面红旗的歌、为三面红旗出力的热潮。少先队还广泛地开展了在毛泽东旗帜下前进的教育活动，学习毛主席领导革命斗争的事迹，教育少年儿童听毛主席的话，作毛主席的好孩子。少先队积极引导少年儿童参加力所能及的社会活动，帮助社会主义建设，为集体做好事情。1959年，全国少年儿童共植树三十亿株，收向日葵、蓖麻等油料一亿七千万斤。在爱国卫生运动中，少年儿童已成为一支最活跃的宣传队和突击队，个个争做除四害讲卫生的小先锋。少先队还大力引导少年儿童参加力所能及的生产劳动。据不完全的统计，全国小学中已建立了四十九万个小工厂，四十一万个小农场，以及许多小饲养场、小苗圃。最近一个时期，结合全民的技术革新和技术革命运动，少先队更加广泛地组织少年儿童开展学习科学技术的活动，仅上海市就有七十万少年儿童参加。哈尔滨市小学三年级以上的少年儿童，许多人都学会制作矿石收音机。这些活动增强了少年儿童热爱党、热爱毛主席、热爱社会主义的思想感情，培养了他们从小为社会造福的共产主义精神，使少年儿童从小就热爱劳动，把劳动当作最光荣的事业，激发了他们将来战胜地球、改造世界的革命志气，开始树立为共产主义事业而奋斗的远大理想和敢想敢干的共产主义风格，成为充满革命朝气的崭新一代。
    这些成绩的取得，是由于党的领导，毛泽东思想的光辉照耀，是党的教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针的伟大胜利。
    党一贯主张以共产主义精神教育少年儿童，使他们在德育、智育、体育方面能够全面发展，把他们培养成为有社会主义觉悟、有文化的劳动者。因此，我们不仅要求少年儿童在课堂中用功读书，而且还积极引导他们参加社会政治生活和力所能及的劳动，使他们从小接受无产阶级世界观的影响，学习文化科学知识，锻炼强健的体魄。
    我们的教育事业，是要造就无产阶级战士。共产主义精神是不可能从静止的生活中培养出来的。因此，我们必需从小引导少年儿童参加政治生活，必需以革命领袖和革命英雄的形象去影响少年儿童，用阶级斗争的事实教育他们，使他们在参加社会主义的政治生活中受到锻炼。列宁说得好：没有工作，没有斗争，那么，单从共产主义小册子和著作中求得书本上的共产主义知识，可以说一文钱不值。
    在党的领导下，我国的少年儿童运动，从开始的第一天起，就是和革命斗争紧密联系起来的。今天的少先队组织继承了这一光荣的革命传统，把政治思想工作放在首要地位，取得了很大的成绩。少先队引导少年儿童阅读革命领袖、革命斗争故事的书籍，纪念革命节日，祭扫烈士陵墓，和英雄模范会见等，以及开展了许多适合少年儿童特点的政治思想教育活动，使他们在活动中受到深刻的社会主义共产主义教育，为伟大的理想所鼓舞，大大激发了少年儿童“天天向上”的革命精神。个个树雄心，立大志。洛阳市古香小学的学生在开展了“毛主席万万岁”的教育活动以后，写诗歌颂毛主席说：“脚踏黄河水倒流，扳倒泰山当枕头，工业农业双跃进，超过英国不发愁。”政治思想教育也大大提高了少年儿童的学习自觉性，树立了为祖国而学习的观念。事实证明，对少年儿童进行政治思想教育，组织少年儿童参加社会政治生活，是培养新人的根本工作，是少先队工作的基本经验。我们必须坚持这一正确的方向。
    共产主义劳动者必须在劳动中培养，劳动可以使人觉悟、使人聪明、使人健康。我们应该从小引导少年儿童参加一些力所能及的劳动，使他们从小认识劳动光荣，劳动没有高低贵贱之分，树立起劳动万岁的观念。少先队一向注意引导少年儿童参加适当的生产劳动，使少年儿童运动同全民生产运动结合起来。几年来，少先队结合我国社会主义建设的实际，选择对少年儿童富有教育意义的又是他们力所能及的事实来开展生产劳动活动，使少年儿童获得了一些生产知识和技能，养成了劳动习惯，培养了尊重劳动人民的思想感情，树立了为人民服务的思想。事实证明：少年儿童参加劳动，无论对他们的智力、体力的发展和思想的提高，都有重要的作用。河南洛阳市敬事街小学的少年儿童，参加了小工厂的劳动，都学会了制作单管收音机，会自己设计线路图，他们还制成了可以收音、电唱等的五用收音机。他们的电学知识，远远超过了一般小学生的水平。具有资产阶级思想的人，不让少年儿童到实际劳动中去受锻炼，只让他们闭门读书，吃现成饭，享现成福。这样只能培养出自私自利、意志消沉的懒汉和懦夫。这和我们培养共产主义新人的目标是背道而驰的。我们坚决反对“自由成长”、“思想是无形的，课堂分数是实在的”等资产阶级的教育思想，坚持党所指出的方向，进一步组织少年儿童参加力所能及的生产劳动和政治社会活动，造就新的一代。
    在少年儿童中广泛地开展科学技术活动，是一项具有深远意义的任务。今天的少年儿童是我国科学技术队伍的后备军。我们要从小就启发他们热爱科学，立志攀登科学高峰。在引导少年儿童开展科技活动方面也存在两种不同的思想：一种是认为只要学好课本上的知识就行了，开展科学技术活动会妨碍学习。另一种认为不仅要学习课本知识，而且要组织少年儿童开展科学技术活动。目前，少年儿童的科学技术活动有了迅速的发展，他们以校外活动场所和学校的小工厂、小农场为基地，进行各种科学试验和革新创造。哈尔滨市小学办的小工厂里已经出现了生产自动线，上海市青浦县商榻小学的少先队员学会了整套的养兔知识，近处农民都来请他们给兔治病。有的少年儿童和工人在一起，从果皮中提炼出酒精，从污泥中提炼出有用的化学药品，用人尿培植了小球藻等。山西卿头小学少先队员种出了上长西红柿、中结茄子、下生马铃薯的“三层楼”植物，培育出了红色棉花。江西还出现了十三岁的县科学研究员，他成功地使水稻和高粱杂交，并培育出许多植物新品种。事实证明，科学技术活动的开展，更增强了少年儿童的求知欲，他们的知识大大超过了课本的范围。更重要的是增长了少年儿童的革命志气。他们说：“前人没想到，我们要想到，世上没有的，我们要创造。”这些事实有力地驳斥了轻视儿童力量，把书本知识和科技活动相隔离的资产阶级思想。为了更好地培养少年儿童，我们必须大力开展群众性的科学技术活动，以最新的科学成就武装他们。
    少年儿童的共产主义教育要以社会教育为主。集体主义精神是需要在集体中培养的。以社会教育为主，正是共产主义教育的特征。随着人民公社化运动的发展，广大家庭妇女走上了生产劳动的岗位，她们的思想觉悟日益提高，也迫切要求逐步实现少年儿童教育的社会化。以社会教育为主，将在少年儿童的共产主义教育中发挥越来越巨大的威力，将把我国少年儿童培养成为毫无自私之心、充满集体主义思想的新一代。当然，并不是说不要家庭教育了。家庭对子女也负有教养的责任，应该以共产主义精神教育自己的子女。这也是家庭对社会应尽的责任。
    共青团组织应该密切协同有关部门，办好儿童的社会教育，进一步加强少先队工作，广泛地组织少年儿童参加校外教育机关的活动。
    热爱儿童，关心儿童，是一种共产主义的美德。少年儿童正处在长身体、长知识的时期，我们应该以共产主义者的精神去关心新的一代，使他们真正做到“身体好、学习好、工作好”，对他们的学习、工作和休息必须坚持劳逸结合的原则，妥善地全面地加以安排。
    在党和毛主席的亲切关怀和领导下，少年儿童工作取得了很大的成绩，积累了丰富的经验。加速培养共产主义新一代，是艰巨而光荣的任务。我们伟大祖国的未来光辉灿烂，我们新生一代的前途鹏程万里。让我们高举毛泽东思想的红旗，把少年儿童运动更加推向前进。
