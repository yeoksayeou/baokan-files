Xinhua News Agency, June 16th, TASS Moscow, June 15th: Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko received Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Kiichi Kadowaki, on June 15th and handed him a statement from the Soviet government to the Japanese government. The statement is as follows:

　　The Soviet government, in a note to the Japanese government on May 20th of this year, urged the Japanese government to pay attention to the dangerous consequences that may arise from the presence of American military aircraft stationed on Japanese territory that are engaged in aerial reconnaissance and provocative activities against the Soviet Union. The note also emphasized that the Japanese government’s signing of a new military treaty with the United States and providing its territory as a base for American aircraft aimed at hostile activities against the Soviet Union undermine the foundation of peaceful and good relations between the two countries.

　　The Japanese government has not yet responded to the aforementioned note from the Soviet government. The Japanese government's delayed response to the note concerning important issues related to Soviet-Japanese relations and ensuring peace and security in the Far East leads one to conclude that the Japanese government apparently does not take into account the seriousness and danger of the situation that may arise from the use of American aircraft stationed in Japan to take aggressive actions against the Soviet Union.

　　Exposing the American policy of violating the sovereignty and inviolability of the borders of other countries, and revealing the piratical acts of American aircraft using bases on the territory of other countries to invade Soviet airspace, should have prompted the Japanese government to take a fresh look at the true role of American military bases in Japan and to recognize the dangers arising from providing Japanese territory for such bases. If the Japanese side does not understand the path that the American militarist circles are pushing Japan down, then the Japanese government's current policy will bring serious disasters to Japan.

　　However, the Japanese government is trying to avoid a sober assessment of the situation, trying to avoid a serious study of the issues raised by the Soviet government, and, according to all circumstances, it is making every effort to ratify the Japan-U.S. military treaty, whose mission is precisely to ensure that Japanese territory is provided to foreign countries to carry out aggression against the Soviet Union and other neighboring countries of Japan.

　　U.S. Secretary of State Herter said on June 7th of this year that the effective scope of this treaty extends to the territories of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other countries in the region; this shameless statement is another proof of the aggressive nature of this treaty. Of course, anything can be written on paper. Those who make such shameless statements can freely declare the Soviet Far East or any other part of the Soviet Union to be within the effective scope of this or that treaty. However, as the saying goes, one's strength does not match one's ambitions. They should not forget the lessons that the Soviet people have given more than once to all those who violate our country. The Soviet Union has sufficient means to eliminate any aggressor's desire to test the solidity of the Soviet borders.

　　Some leaders of the Japanese government (including Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi and Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama), in order to justify the fact that Japanese territory is being used for provocative activities against neighboring countries, have constantly made statements saying that American military aircraft taking off from Japanese bases and violating the borders of other countries are merely conducting harmless meteorological research flights. It is surprising that the Japanese leaders made the above remarks after the U.S. government was exposed to the world as a vicious destroyer of international law, an organizer of aggressive activities against other countries, and it abandoned the set of lies it had fabricated to deceive the world about the mission of the American aircraft that invaded Soviet airspace on May 1st of this year.

　　The criminal activities of American aircraft taking off from Japanese territory and the Japanese government's attempts to justify its actual participation in such activities once again clearly demonstrate the aggressive nature of the new Japan-U.S. military treaty.

　　According to all circumstances, the Japanese government is pursuing the policy of forces that are determined to hinder the establishment of good relations between Japan and the Soviet Union and other neighboring countries, and ultimately bring Japan into conflict with these countries. These forces clearly associate the conclusion of the Japan-U.S. treaty with such intentions as turning Japanese territory into some kind of shelter for the United States, so that Japan will bear the first retaliatory strikes in the event of a military conflict erupting due to the sins of the American aggressor groups.

　　The Soviet government considers it necessary to express once again its attitude towards the Japan-U.S. military treaty and the use of bases in Japan by American aircraft for aggressive activities through this statement, so that the Japanese government has no doubt about the dangerous path it is pushing Japan down.

　　Japanese Ambassador Kiichi Kadowaki stated that he would immediately forward the Soviet government's statement to the Japanese government.

### 苏联政府向日本政府提出照会  美国利用在日本的军事基地侵略苏联  日本政府现行方针将使日本招致灾难

    苏联政府向日本政府提出照会
    美国利用在日本的军事基地侵略苏联
    日本政府现行方针将使日本招致灾难
    新华社16日讯　塔斯社莫斯科15日电：苏联外交部长葛罗米柯在6月15日接见了日本驻苏联特命全权大使门胁季光，并把苏联政府给日本政府的声明交给了他。声明如下：
    苏联政府在今年5月20日曾给日本政府一份照会，促请日本政府注意由于在日本领土上驻扎着从事空中侦察和对苏联进行挑衅活动的美国军用飞机而可能产生的危险后果。在这份照会中还强调指出，日本政府同美国签订新的军事条约，提供本国领土给旨在对苏联采取敌对活动的美国飞机作为基地，这就破坏了两国间的和平和良好关系的基础。
    日本政府对苏联政府的上述照会至今还没有答复。日本政府对涉及到苏日关系和保障远东和平与安全的重要问题的照会迟迟不作答复，这就使人有根据得出一个结论：日本政府显然没有考虑到由于利用驻扎在日本的美国飞机来对苏联采取侵略行动而可能形成的那种局势的严重性和危险性。
    揭露美国所执行的侵犯其他国家主权和边境不可侵犯性的政策、揭发美国飞机利用在别国领土上的基地强盗式地入侵苏联领空的行径，本应该促使日本政府以新的眼光来看待美国在日本的军事基地的真正作用，认识到由于提供日本领土作这种基地而产生的危险性。如果日本方面不理解到，美国军国主义集团正在把日本推上怎样的道路，那么，日本政府现行的方针就会给日本招致严重的灾难。
    但是，日本政府力图回避对局势作清醒的估计，力图回避认真研究苏联政府提出的问题，而且，根据一切情况看来，它正竭尽全力来批准日美军事条约，而这个条约的使命正是保证把日本领土提供给外国，用来对苏联、对日本的其他邻国进行侵略。
    美国国务卿赫脱今年6月7日说，这个条约的有效范围扩及苏联、中华人民共和国和这个地区其他国家的领土；这一无耻声明是这个条约具有侵略性的又一证明。当然，在纸上什么都可以写。发表这种无耻声明的人可以随便宣布苏联的远东或者苏联的任何其他部分为这种或那种条约的有效范围。但是，俗话说得好，力不从心。他们不应当忘记苏联人民不止一次地给予侵犯我国的一切人的教训。苏联拥有充分的手段，来打掉任何侵略者企图试试苏联国界的巩固性的欲望。
    日本政府的某些领导人（其中包括岸信介首相和藤山爱一郎外务相）为了替日本领土被用来对邻国进行挑衅活动一事辩解，不断发表声明，说什么从日本基地起飞侵犯别国国境的美国军用飞机，只不过是进行着于人无害的气象研究飞行。不能不使人奇怪的是，在美国政府在全世界面前被揭穿了它是国际法的凶恶破坏者、是对别国进行侵略活动的组织者、它自己放弃了就今年5月1日入侵苏联领空的美国飞机的使命编造的一套欺骗世人的谎话以后，日本领导人发表了上述论调。
    从日本领土起飞的美国飞机的罪恶活动和日本政府企图为它实际参与这种活动辩解的做法，再一次明显地说明了新的日美军事条约的侵略性质。
    根据一切情况看来，日本政府追随着这样一些势力的政策，这些势力一心要阻挠日本同苏联、同其他邻国建立良好关系，并且最终使日本同这些国家发生冲突。这些势力显然把缔结日美条约同这样的打算联系在一起，即把日本的领土变为美国的某种掩体，一旦由于美国侵略集团的罪过而爆发军事冲突时，让日本承受第一批报复性打击。
    苏联政府认为必须通过这个声明，再一次表示自己对日美军事条约、对美国飞机利用在日本的基地进行侵略活动所采取的态度，以便使日本政府毫不怀疑，它正在把日本推上怎样危险的道路。
                                      1960年6月15日
    日本大使门胁季光表示，他立即把苏联政府的声明转交日本政府。
