Xinhua News Agency, New York, June 7th (TASS dispatch): Gus Hall, General Secretary of the Communist Party USA, issued a statement to the press on behalf of the Communist Party's National Committee, stating that President Eisenhower's visit to Japan is "an inappropriate and dangerous interference in Japan's internal affairs, and the visit should be canceled immediately."

    The statement said, "The vital interests of the American people require President Eisenhower to abandon his scheduled visit to Japan on June 19th, because the purpose of this visit is to once again impose a policy of war and militarism on that country."

    The statement pointed out that the whole world knows that the vast majority of the Japanese people oppose Eisenhower's visit and oppose the so-called "mutual security treaty" with the United States. Despite this, the State Department stubbornly insists on the President's visit.

    The statement emphasized, "The so-called mutual security treaty is nothing but an attempt to turn Japan into a fortress of reactionary forces and strengthen the State Department's control over it. This treaty serves the purposes of the Cold War and will greatly increase the danger of a hot war and nuclear war in the Far East, which could endanger the entire world. This treaty preserves military bases in Japan, from which Allen Dulles' 'U-2' planes will continue to conduct provocative and aggressive espionage flights against the sovereignty of China and other countries."

    In discussing the widespread public opposition in Japan to Eisenhower's visit, the statement said: "This visit is an attempt to do what the Kishi Nobusuke government could not do: force the Japanese people to accept this military treaty. The visit will only lead to an exacerbation of international tensions, especially in the Far East, and will poison the friendly relations between the Japanese and American people. Moreover, it is clear that Kishi Nobusuke is just another Syngman Rhee."

    The Communist Party USA finally called on "all workers and peace-loving democrats to support the Japanese people with all kinds of gatherings, through resolutions, organizing pickets and demonstrations."

    美共全国委员会发表声明指出
    艾森豪威尔访日将加剧国际紧张局势
    据新华社7日讯　据塔斯社纽约7日讯：美国共产党总书记葛斯·霍尔以共产党全国委员会的名义向报界发表声明指出，美国总统艾森豪威尔访问日本“是不适当地和危险地干涉日本的内政，应当立即取消这次访问”。
    声明说，“美国人民的切身利益，要求艾森豪威尔总统放弃原定在6月19日到日本的访问，因为这次访问的目的是想再一次把战争和军国主义的政策强加于这个国家。”
    声明指出，全世界都知道，绝大多数日本人民都反对艾森豪威尔的访问，反对同美国签订所谓“共同安全条约”。尽管如此，国务院还是顽固地坚持要总统前往访问。
    声明强调指出，“所谓共同安全条约不是别的，正是把日本变为反动势力的堡垒和加强国务院对它的统治的企图。这个条约服务于冷战的目的，并将大大增加远东的热战和核战争的危险，这场战争将可能危及全世界。这个条约保存了在日本的军事基地，艾伦·杜勒斯的‘U—2’飞机今后还将从这些基地进行反对中国和其他国家主权的挑衅性的侵略的间谍飞行。”
    声明在谈到日本公众广泛地反对艾森豪威尔的访问时说：“这次访问是企图做到岸信介政府所不能做到的事情：强迫日本人民接受这个军事条约。访问只会导致国际紧张局势的加剧，特别是远东局势的加剧，并将毒化日本和美国人民之间的友好关系。此外，很明显，岸信介只不过是另一个李承晚而已。”
    美国共产党最后号召“全体工人和爱好和平的民主人士以各种集会、通过决议、组织纠察队和示威来声援日本人民”。
