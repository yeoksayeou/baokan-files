Xinhua News Agency, June 9th. TASS commentator Kharikov wrote on June 8th: U.S. Secretary of State Herter recently told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the effective range of the U.S.-Japan military treaty extends to the entire Far East, and that the territories of the Soviet Union and China are also included in this range. In this way, the leader of the U.S. foreign affairs department has very blatantly admitted the bandit nature of the U.S.-Japan military alliance, exposing its aggressive essence.

The commentator continued, the effective range of the U.S.-Japan military treaty actually means the range within which U.S. and Japanese armed forces jointly take military action. Because, according to this treaty, Japan not only provides bases for the United States, but also has the obligation to wildly assist the U.S. military in its activities. Obviously, the effective range of the U.S.-Japan treaty far exceeds the borders of Japan and the surrounding areas. Where is the defense here! There is none. This is a full-blown aggressive purpose exuding the stench of old expansionist conspiracies.

The commentator pointed out that Japanese militarists are intoxicated by the delusion that cooperation with the United States can help them realize their plans to invade neighboring democratic countries.

The commentator wrote, it is quite obvious that any attempt by Japanese militarist elements to collude with other forces to launch military adventures to invade the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China is tantamount to national suicide. The patriotic forces of Japan understand this, and therefore they believe that blocking the conspiracy of the U.S.-Japan aggressors is the greatest task of the Japanese nation.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 10th. The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published a commentary today stating that U.S. Secretary of State Herter's speech on June 7th before the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee exposed that the collusion between U.S. imperialism and Japanese militarists is indeed for the purpose of invading the Soviet Union, China, and other Asian countries.

The commentary pointed out that the U.S. ruling clique and the Kishi Nobusuke clique have constantly concealed the aggressive purpose of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, saying that it only has a "defensive" nature, that its purpose is to "defend" peace and security in Asia, and to strengthen the "friendly" relationship between Japan and the United States. However, Herter's remarks completely negated all the above clumsy arguments, enabling the Japanese people, the American people, and the people of the world to further recognize the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and Japanese militarists, and to further recognize the extremely reactionary and dangerous nature of the U.S.-Japan military treaty.

The commentary expressed its firm belief that the Japanese people will further carry out the struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

The commentary warned that if the U.S.-Kishi group dares to launch a war, they will definitely be wiped out.

    塔斯社和越南“人民报”评赫脱讲话
    日美条约侵略本质充分暴露
    新华社9日讯　塔斯社评论员哈里科夫8日写道：美国国务卿赫脱最近对参议院外交委员会说美日军事条约的有效范围及于整个远东，还说苏联和中国的领土同样包括在这个范围之内。这样一来，美国外交主管部门的领导人就十分露骨地承认了日美军事联盟的强盗性质，暴露了它的侵略本质。
    评论员接着说，美日军事条约的有效范围实际上意味着，这是美日武装力量共同采取军事行动的范围。因为，根据这个条约，日本不仅向美国提供基地，而且还有义务猖狂地协助美国军队进行活动。显然，美日条约的有效范围远远超过了日本国界和日本周围的地区。这里有什么国防呢！没有。这是十足的、散发着老扩张主义阴谋气味的侵略目的。
    评论员指出，日本军国主义者迷醉于这样的妄想：同美国的合作可以帮助他们实现侵略毗邻的民主国家的计划。
    评论员写道，日本军国主义分子想勾结其他势力发动侵略苏联和中华人民共和国的军事冒险，任何这样的企图都等于民族自杀，这是十分明显的。日本爱国力量理解这一点，因此他们认为阻挡美日侵略者的阴谋是日本民族的最大任务。
    新华社河内10日电　越南“人民报”今天发表评论说，美国国务卿赫脱6月7日在美国参议院外交委员会上的讲话暴露了美帝国主义同日本军国主义者的勾结确是为了侵略苏联、中国和其他亚洲国家。
    评论指出，美国统治集团和岸信介集团不断掩饰日美军事同盟条约的侵略目的，说它只具有“防御”性质，它的目的是“保卫”亚洲的和平安全，密切日美的“友好”关系。但是赫脱的谈话完全否定了上述一切笨拙的论调，使日本人民、美国人民和全世界人民进一步认清了美帝国主义和日本军国主义者的阴谋，进一步认清了日美军事条约的极其反动和危险的性质。
    评论表示坚信，日本人民定将进一步开展反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争。
    评论警告说，如果美岸集团胆敢发动战争，它们一定会被消灭。
