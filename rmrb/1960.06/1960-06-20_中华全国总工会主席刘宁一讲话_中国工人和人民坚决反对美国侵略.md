Xinhua News Agency, June 18th: Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, made a speech at a gathering of leading members from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and various industrial trade unions. He said that the chieftain of the American imperialist bandits, Eisenhower, after shamelessly dispatching spy planes to invade the Soviet Union and sabotaging the Four-Power Summit, recently traveled more than 10,000 kilometers to the Western Pacific region to intensify aggression and war preparations, in order to maintain its aggressive positions in Asia and strengthen its oppression of the people of various Asian countries. This "plague god's" "visit" to Taiwan is another blatant provocation against the 650 million Chinese people and the people of Asian countries. The Chinese workers express extreme anger at this. On June 17th, the Fujian Front Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army issued a letter to the military and civilians of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu, deciding to bombard Jinmen to hold an anti-American armed demonstration. This decision fully expresses the firm will and determination of the Chinese workers and the people of the whole country to oppose American imperialism, as well as the contempt and disdain for the American imperialist chieftain Eisenhower. Our entire workforce in China completely supports this great anti-American armed demonstration and is determined to fight to the end against American imperialism's shameless aggression and military provocations against our country.

Liu Ningyi said that American imperialism has occupied our country's territory of Taiwan by force for ten years. It has consistently and cruelly enslaved and oppressed our compatriots in Taiwan, and has conspired to create "two Chinas," turning Taiwan into its colony and a springboard for launching wars of aggression. All righteous people in the world express indignation and protest against this naked act of aggression by American imperialism.

Liu Ningyi stated that the workers and people of various Asian countries are currently whipping up a revolutionary storm against American imperialism and its lackeys. The magnificent and heroic struggles of the people of Japan, South Korea, Turkey, and other Asian countries have placed American imperialism in an unprecedentedly isolated situation, like a rat running across the street, chased and beaten by everyone. Eisenhower's trip to Asia this time does not indicate the strength of American imperialism, but fully exposes its weakness and ugliness. Under the siege of accusations from people all over Asia, he stubbornly tried to save the fate of his lackeys, continue to interfere in the internal affairs of various countries, suppress the patriotic and just struggles of the people of various countries, and resolutely antagonize the Chinese and Asian people. This once again nakedly exposes that American imperialism is the pillar of the most reactionary and decadent forces in various Asian countries and the most ferocious enemy of the people of Asia and the world. The sinful activities of American imperialism can only arouse greater anger and opposition from the people of Asia and the world. The people of Asia will teach American imperialism and its lackeys a lesson with greater and more resolute struggles! The Chinese workers and people resolutely stand with the workers and people of various Asian countries and fight to the end against American imperialism's aggression and to drive American imperialism out of the Western Pacific. Liu Ningyi concluded by saying: The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan! People of Asia, unite and overthrow American imperialism!

    中华全国总工会主席刘宁一讲话
    中国工人和人民坚决反对美国侵略
    新华社18日讯　中华全国总工会主席刘宁一在全总和各产业工会负责人的集会上发表谈话，他说，美帝国主义强盗头子艾森豪威尔，在无耻地派遣间谍飞机对苏联进行侵略并破坏了四国首脑会议之后，最近为了维持它在亚洲的侵略阵地，加强它对亚洲各国人民的压迫，跑了一万多公里到西太平洋地区来加紧侵略和备战活动。这个“瘟神”到台湾去“访问”，是对中国六亿五千万人民和亚洲各国人民又一次公然的挑衅。中国工人对此表示极大的愤怒。6月17日，中国人民解放军福建前线司令部发表了告台、澎、金、马军民同胞书，决定炮轰金门举行反美武装示威。这个决定充分表示了中国工人和全国人民反对美帝国主义的坚强意志和决心，以及对美帝国主义头子艾森豪威尔的蔑视和鄙视。我们中国全体职工完全拥护这个伟大的反美武装示威，坚决同美帝国主义对我国的无耻侵略和军事挑衅斗争到底。
    刘宁一说，美帝国主义武装侵占我国的领土台湾已经十年了。它一贯残酷地奴役和压迫我国的台湾同胞，并阴谋制造“两个中国”，把台湾变为它的殖民地，变为它发动侵略战争的跳板。全世界一切正义人民对美帝国主义这种赤裸裸的侵略行为莫不表示愤慨和抗议。
    刘宁一表示，目前亚洲各国的工人和人民正在掀起反对美帝国主义及其走狗的革命风暴。日本、南朝鲜、土耳其和其他亚洲国家人民波涛壮阔的英勇斗争已使美帝国主义像老鼠过街，人人喊打一样，陷于到处挨打、空前孤立的境地。这次艾森豪威尔亚洲之行决不是表示美帝国主义的强大，而是充分暴露了它的虚弱和丑态。他在亚洲人民到处声讨的围攻下，硬着头皮企图挽救它的走狗的命运，继续干涉各国内政，压制各国人民的爱国正义斗争，坚决与中国及亚洲人民为敌。这再一次赤裸裸地暴露美帝国主义是亚洲各国最反动、最腐朽势力的支柱，是亚洲和全世界人民的最凶恶的敌人。美帝国主义的罪恶活动只能激起亚洲和全世界人民更大的愤怒和反对。亚洲人民将以更大的、更加坚决的斗争行动来教训美帝国主义及其走狗们！中国工人和人民坚决和亚洲各国工人和人民在一起为反对美帝国主义的侵略、把美帝国主义从西太平洋赶出去而斗争到底。刘宁一最后说：中国人民一定要解放台湾！亚洲人民团结起来，打倒美帝国主义！
