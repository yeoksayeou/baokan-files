	Shanxi: 90% of Communes Have Chemical Factories
	90% of the communes in Shanxi Province have chemical factories, producing over a thousand kinds of products. The output value of county and commune chemical factories accounts for more than 30% of the total output value of the province's chemical industry.

	In the great effort to establish county and commune chemical industries, various localities have mobilized the masses to carry out technical reforms on a large scale, enabling many "small, indigenous groups" to rapidly transition to "small, modern groups." The "March 8th" Pesticide Factory of the Sudian Commune in Changzhi City relied entirely on manual operation when it was established in March of this year. In recent months, it has independently created and assembled crushers, steel rollers, electric screens, and mixers, basically achieving mechanization.

	Xinjiang Makes Full Use of Water Surfaces for Fish Farming
	The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region is developing its aquaculture industry on a large scale. Currently, some fish fry introduced from Wuhan and fish fry caught in Ili and other places have been successively released into ponds and river forks in areas along the railway lines of Urumqi, Changji, Miquan, Turpan, and Shanshan.

	The number of aquatic animals and plants cultivated this year is not only dozens of times more than the total of the past few years, but also includes many new varieties.

	Xinjiang began aquaculture production after the Great Leap Forward in 1958. After several years of vigorous water conservancy construction, the autonomous region currently has rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and waterlogged areas totaling 200 million square meters.

	Anhui Utilizes Over 5 Million Mu of Vacant Land to Plant Crops
	Various localities in Anhui Province have utilized over 5 million mu of vacant land to plant food crops, oil crops, melons, and vegetables. Currently, in addition to seizing the opportunity to continue planting, various localities are strengthening the field management of the crops that have already been planted.

	The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party called on various localities to "utilize all available vacant land to plant crops, ensuring that every inch of land is used and that more is planted and harvested." Party committees at all levels have regarded this work as an important task, and have mobilized the masses to calculate the benefits of planting more and harvesting more, creating a surge of enthusiasm for expanding planting without wasting an inch of land.

	In order to achieve high yields and abundant harvests from crops planted on vacant land, various localities have promptly carried out management work such as checking seedlings and replacing missing ones, applying fertilizer, and weeding after planting, and have rationally arranged labor, universally promoting the field management responsibility system.

	Heilongjiang Province Overfulfills Sugar Beet Planting Plan
	Heilongjiang Province has overfulfilled its sugar beet planting plan by 9,000 mu. The quality of sugar beet planting in Heilongjiang Province this year is very good, with the area of deeply ploughed sugar beet land increasing by 10% compared to the past, and the amount of fertilizer applied per mu exceeding 2,600 jin. In order to achieve the sugar beet production increase plan, various localities have established 44 large-scale sugar beet bases, covering an area of over 490,000 mu.

	Hulunbuir League Builds Water Power Stations on a Large Scale
	A mass movement to build simple water power stations on a large scale is underway in various parts of the Hulunbuir League in Inner Mongolia. This year, the Mongolian and Han farmers and herdsmen of the Zalaite Banner have built some water power stations without using a single jin of cement or a single steel bar, using only stones, willow branches, and wooden water turbines. Each water power station simultaneously drives a steel mill, a stone mill, and a fodder cutter for production. This type of water power station can save six man-days and nine animal-days of labor each day. The Hulunbuir League Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently decided that 600 simple water power stations should be built throughout the region before "July 1st."
