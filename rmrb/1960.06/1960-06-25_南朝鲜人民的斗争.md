    The struggle of the South Korean people against US imperialism and its running dog traitors truly encompasses the entire population. Therefore, this struggle is gradually developing more broadly and deeply.

    Children around the age of ten, holding up slogans, block the enemy's tanks, shouting, "Who are your guns pointed at? Don't shoot our fathers, mothers, brothers, and sisters, turn your guns around!" Even they know that the guns should be aimed at the national enemy—US imperialism and its running dogs. Old men and women in their seventies and eighties say, "Our sons and grandsons have fallen, what are we living for?" They also participate in demonstrations, joining their sons and grandsons in the sacred battle to strike the enemy. Students launched a struggle to expel reactionary, pro-government faculty members; workers in factories, mines, docks, and transportation departments held strikes or engaged in various struggles and demands; farmers whose families were murdered by US imperialism and its running dogs shouted to punish the executioners, demonstrating and taking direct action against the enemy.

    We still remember that on June 19, 1950, the notorious Dulles came to South Korea for a so-called inspection, and six days later, on June 25, the enemy suddenly ignited the flames of aggression against North Korea… It has been ten full years since then. On June 19 this year, the bandit chieftain Eisenhower came to South Korea again. It can be estimated that this fellow will reminisce about Dulles's past and will see again the flames that were lit ten years ago.

    However, the era has completely changed, and the footprints of the past ten years eloquently demonstrate this. These ten years have seen changes with unparalleled speed, both in the world and in Korea. But, in a word, during this period, the world and history have never stood with the enemies of mankind and their new weapons. Instead, they have proven to always stand with the Korean people who are fighting for justice, peace, and the unification of their motherland.

    During the decisive period of the war, the 650 million Chinese people, who became the masters of a new history, aided us with their most precious blood, wisdom, and love. The Soviet people and other socialist countries, as well as kind people from all countries, supported the Korean people. These significant, world-changing facts all demonstrate this. Therefore, the South Korean people, in the man-made hell created by the US military and in an environment called the festering sore of the earth, have grown towards the sun and finally, today, have broken through the circumstances imposed upon them by the US imperialist bandits and stood up.

    Eisenhower recently came here, still fantasizing about one day igniting the flames of war. Therefore, his "visit" to South Korea is merely the "demonstration" of a corpse. Who can be intimidated by his "demonstration"? It can only inspire contempt, hatred, and anger.

    The North and South Korean people, with the support of their righteous brothers—the Chinese people and the kind people of the Soviet Union and the world—are rising up more vigorously and launching a sacred struggle to end the evil world created by US imperialism.

    Today, we still clearly remember an incident that happened in Busan three years ago. A fuel pipeline forcibly installed by US imperialism in a residential area of Busan caused a fire. In an instant, forty-five residents were burned to death, and 140 houses were destroyed. Despite this, the US imperialist invading army was indifferent at the time and is even more indifferent now, strutting arrogantly through the streets of Busan.

    But the residents remember this incident deeply! When the news came that the bandit chieftain Eisenhower, this street rat, was coming to South Korea to stay for a few hours and expose his ugly face, the new and old hatreds of the victims' families and citizens burned like flames. More than six hundred family members and citizens decided to rush into the US military barracks in Busan when the enemy's leader arrived, shouting slogans such as "US troops get out!" and "Eisenhower get out immediately!" to demonstrate.

    Now, let's look at how the South Korean people in another place responded to Eisenhower's visit!

    On June 14, more than three thousand farmers in the suburbs of Daegu held a mass rally in Fire Station Square, demanding immediate payment of compensation for the more than 400,000 pyeong of farmland forcibly requisitioned by the US imperialist invading army, and solemnly declared that they would achieve their goals by force.

    From this, we see the seeds of the South Korean people's final victory. In particular, the collective uprising of farmers in various places, in step with the continued expansion of the South Korean workers' struggle, is undoubtedly a decisive condition for the victory of the South Korean people's struggle.

    After Eisenhower "visited" Chiang Kai-shek, his blood-stained feet stepped on Seoul. Although the US imperialist running dogs mobilized more than twelve thousand wolf-like police officers to temporarily suppress the masses, the masses who came out to see the bandit did not shout "Long live!" or applaud once. A girl was arrested for throwing a stone. This gang of bandits dared not walk the main streets and had to sneak through alleys. All these facts illustrate the inner feelings of the South Korean people. There is no doubt that this feeling, like a volcano, will erupt one day.

    The South Korean people clearly know how the people of North Korea obtained their current situation, happiness, and the development of the people's economy. They know that our amazing people's economic construction was not achieved by begging and wishes, but through an unyielding struggle against US imperialism and all enemies.

    The South Korean people, like the North Korean people, know that there can be no co-existence or co-prosperity with the imperialists. Therefore, even unarmed, with bare hands, they must struggle and advance in victory.

    The flames of resistance of the South Korean people are now truly expanding to the cities and countryside of South Korea, extending to all classes: students, workers, farmers, merchants, citizens, veterans, disabled soldiers, unemployed civilians, beggars, etc. Except for the extremely small number of human dregs who share the enemy's fate, it can be said that no one is not participating in this struggle. The struggle encompasses the broad masses. The forms of struggle include: general strikes by workers and sit-down strikes to implement various demands and conditions, student strikes and the expulsion of reactionary, pro-government faculty members, resistance to taxes or demands for tax reductions, the abolition of various fascist laws and exorbitant taxes and levies, the liquidation of executioners, and demands for compensation or the return of land requisitioned by the US imperialist invading army. The struggle to protect the right to survival and against US imperialism and reactionary rule is developing widely with new forms and methods. At the same time, these demands all stem from pressing life needs! Therefore, these demands, in the final analysis, inevitably trace back to the US imperialist invading army and its running dogs, which threaten the life and survival of the South Korean people. Therefore, none of these demands or struggles are exceptions to the demand for the abolition of US imperialism's colonial policies. Thus, the South Korean people's struggle is gradually transforming its central slogan into "US troops get out!" Yes! The resistance of the South Korean people is clearly a struggle against US imperialism, and it proves that this struggle will inevitably drive the US imperialist invading army out of our motherland. This struggle is the prelude and march of final victory. The people continue to advance with full of hope. But how does US imperialism respond to the people?

    When international tensions eased and preparations were being made for a summit conference, US imperialism transported new weapons such as "Honest John" and "Matador" missiles into South Korea and conducted various atomic war exercises. After the summit conference was sabotaged by US imperialism, it seemed to have seized a good opportunity and further extended its claws of aggression towards South Korea. Now, US imperialism is openly clamoring to prepare for launching a war in South Korea and has invested most of the funds for aggression in the Far East in South Korea.

    Their news agencies are also openly clamoring that they recently dispatched two thousand US airborne troops to Okinawa Island, and that they can participate in local wars and all-out wars in the Western Pacific region. The US imperialists, disregarding the unanimous condemnation of the Japanese people and all peace-loving people around the world, forcibly fabricated the US-Japan military alliance treaty, revived Japanese militarism, and attempted to use Japan as a new springboard for aggressive wars against socialist countries such as Korea, China, and the Soviet Union, and peace-loving people in Asia. At the same time, US imperialism is also attempting to create a new aggressive "Northeast Asia Alliance" with Japan as its core, linking it to aggressive military groups manipulated by US imperialism such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the Central Treaty Organization. All these facts prove that US imperialists, while verbally preaching peace, are pursuing new aggressive wars behind their backs.

    The power of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union is infinitely stronger than the imperialist aggressive forces. If the imperialists dare to launch a new aggressive war, they will suffer a disastrous defeat.

    Unite all peaceful forces opposing imperialism and colonialism, expose and shatter the aggressive attempts of imperialism, especially US imperialism, tie their hands and feet, and prevent them from easily launching aggressive wars. It is important to raise vigilance and further unite all forces opposing imperialism and colonialism.

    The consolidation and peace of Korea also lie in: only by consolidating the revolutionary democratic base in the north of the Republic more firmly than a bronze wall, raising vigilance, monitoring the enemy's every move, uniting all patriotic forces in North and South Korea, and driving the US imperialist aggressors out of the southern part of our motherland.

    The socialist great leap forward in North Korea and the support and yearning for it by the South Korean people are a material guarantee for opposing and finally defeating the US imperialist aggressors and the fascist rule they have created.

    The North and South Korean people are confident in the unification and true peace of the motherland and are fighting for it.

    Based on these, we say: history has changed. But what has changed is definitely not imperialism.

    The great transformation we see is: the heroic struggle of the South Korean people against US imperialism and its running dogs. This is a huge event in our historical development.

    Here, I would like to finally talk about a fragment of the South Korean people's struggle—the heroic struggle of the Geochang farmers. They seized and burned to death the running dogs of US imperialism who massacred their families ten years ago. However, the puppet police began to arrest some people under the pretext of investigating the masterminds. At this time, two thousand farmers all shouted that they were the masterminds. They became more united. Therefore, the US military and the puppet police had no choice but to release all the arrested personnel. Of course, this is just a small example, but from this, we can see that no force can stop the power of the people's unity. However, this is not limited to the Geochang farmers; it is a common phenomenon among all the South Korean people. From this, people can truly understand the heroic struggle of the South Korean people today. In fact, following the Geochang farmers' uprising, peasant uprisings continued to erupt in Sancheong, Hamyang, Jeju Island, Busan, Daegu, Dalseong, Yeongdeok, Jangheung, Hampyeong, Jangseong, Damyang, Hwasun, Yangsan, Gachang, Gyeongsan, Chilgok, Sindong, Miryang, Namwon, Sunchang, Cheongju, Daejeon, Jeonju, Gwangju, Imsil, Suncheon, Chungju, Tongyeong, Haman, etc.

    I would like to introduce here a song sung by a farmer about the Geochang farmers' uprising, which was the first eruption of this great power, to see the feelings of the North and South Korean people today.

    Everyone is a hero, thirty million are all heroes,
    The Geochang farmers are united as one, setting an example,
    The enemy beats the drums, attacking them.
    The damned cannot live even if they want to,
    Lofty righteousness makes death afraid to approach them,
    The two thousand farmers of Geochang are all like this.
    We cannot believe in co-existence with the enemy,
    US imperialism uses sharp knives against the backs of our compatriots at all times,
    Only by making the enemy die can we live.
    The power of unity of purpose can overcome the heavens,
    Heroes and good men should all learn from Geochang,
    The three thousand miles of rivers and mountains are one world,
    Like one body, one family.

### 南朝鲜人民的斗争

    南朝鲜人民的斗争
    朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会委员长　韩雪野
    南朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义和他的走狗卖国贼的斗争，真正地包括了全体人民，所以这一斗争逐步地更加广泛、更加深入地发展着。
    十岁左右的儿童们高举着标语挡住敌人的坦克，高呼“你们的枪口对着谁？不要打我们的爸爸、妈妈、哥哥、姐姐，把枪口调过去！”连他们也知道枪口应该对准民族的敌人——美帝国主义和它的走狗。七八十岁的老头、老太太说：“儿子、孙子都倒下去了，剩下我们还活着干什么？”他们也参加示威，同儿子、孙子一道投入打击敌人的神圣的战斗中去。学生们展开了驱逐反动的御用教职员的斗争；工厂、矿山、码头、交通部门的工人举行了罢工，或者进行各种斗争和要求；被美帝国主义和他的走狗屠杀了家属的农民，呼喊要惩办刽子手，以示威和直接行动起来反对敌人。
    我们还记得，1950年6月19日臭名远扬的杜勒斯来到南朝鲜进行所谓视察的六天后的6月25日，敌人突然燃起了侵略北朝鲜的战火……。从那时起，整整过了十年了。今年的6月19日，强盗头子艾森豪威尔又来了南朝鲜。可以估计到，这个家伙会怀念杜勒斯的往事，会重新看到十年前点起来的那股火焰。
    但是，时代已经完全变了，过去十年的脚印比什么都雄辩地说明这一点。这十年来，在世界上也好，在朝鲜也好，都以无比的速度变化着。但是，一句话，在这一期间，世界和历史决没有同人类的敌人和它们的新式武器站在一起，而是证明始终是同为了正义、和平和为争取祖国统一而斗争的朝鲜人民站在一起。
    在战争的决定性时期，成为新历史的主人的六亿五千万中国人民以最宝贵的鲜血、智慧和热爱援助了我们，苏联人民和其他社会主义国家以及各国善良的人们支持了朝鲜人民，这些重大的具有世界意义的事实都说明了这一点。所以，南朝鲜人民在美军制造的人间地狱和在被人们称为地球上的浓疮的环境里，向着太阳成长，终于在今天突破了美帝国主义强盗强加给他们的处境站起来了。
    艾森豪威尔最近来到这里，还幻想有一天燃起战争火焰。所以，他的“访问”南朝鲜，只不过等于一具僵尸的“示威”。谁能被他的“示威”吓倒呢？只能使人对他鄙视、憎恨和愤怒。
    南北朝鲜人民在仁义的兄弟——中国人民和苏联及全世界善良的人民支持下，更加奋发地站起来，展开了结束美帝国主义制造的罪恶世界的神圣斗争。
    如今我们还清楚地记得三年前在釜山发生的一件事情。美帝国主义在釜山居民区强行设置的输油管引起了火灾，转瞬间，烧死了四十五个居民，烧掉了一百四十家居民的房屋。虽然如此，美帝国主义侵略军在当时却若无其事，现在更加若无其事了，而且傲慢地昂首阔步地在釜山街道上横冲直撞。
    但是，居民们可是刻骨地记着这件事情！当强盗头子艾森豪威尔这只过街老鼠要来南朝鲜停留几个小时，暴露出他丑恶的面目的消息传来时，死难者的家属和市民们的新仇旧恨像火焰一样燃烧起来了。六百多名家属和市民决定在敌人的头子到来的时候冲进釜山的美军兵营，高呼“美军滚出去！”“艾森豪威尔立即滚蛋！”等口号，进行示威。
    再看另一个地方的南朝鲜人民对艾森豪威尔的访问的回答吧！
    6月14日大丘市郊的三千多农民，在消防队广场举行了群众集会，要求立即付给美帝国主义侵略军强征的四十多万坪耕地的赔偿费，并严正宣布，要以实力来达到自己的目的。
    我们从这里看到了孕育着南朝鲜人民的最后胜利。特别是同南朝鲜工人的继续扩大的斗争步调一致的各地农民的集体的奋起，无疑地是南朝鲜人民斗争胜利决定性的条件。
    当艾森豪威尔“访问”了蒋介石以后，他的沾满了鲜血的两脚踏上汉城。美帝国主义的走狗虽然动员了一万二千多个狼一般的警察，一时制止了群众，但是出来看强盗的群众未喊一声“万岁”，未鼓一次掌。一个姑娘却因扔了石头被逮捕。这一伙强盗不敢走大街，只好钻小巷。这一切事实就说明了南朝鲜人民内心的感情。毫无疑问，这个感情像火山一般，爆发的日子必将到来。
    南朝鲜人民清楚地知道，北朝鲜人民的今天这样处境、幸福和人民经济的发展是怎样得来的。他们知道，我们的惊人的人民经济建设决不是依靠乞求和愿望而得来的，而是在同美帝国主义和一切敌人进行不屈不挠的斗争中所获得的成果。
    南朝鲜人民同北朝鲜人民一样地知道同帝国主义者是不能两立或者共存的。所以，手无寸铁、赤手空拳也要进行斗争，同时在胜利中前进。
    现在的南朝鲜人民抗争的火焰真正地扩大到了南朝鲜的城市和农村，扩大到了各阶层，学生、工人、农民、商人、市民、退伍军人、残废军人、失业平民、乞丐等等，除了同敌人共命运的极少数人类渣滓以外，可以说没有不参加这个斗争的。斗争包括了广大群众。斗争形式有：工人的总罢工和为贯彻各种要求条件的静坐斗争，学生的罢课和驱逐反动的御用教职员，抗税或要求减税，废除各种法西斯法令和苛捐杂税，肃清刽子手，要求赔偿或交还被美帝国主义侵略军征用的土地等。为保卫生存权利和反对美帝国主义和反动统治的斗争，日益以新形式和新方法广泛地发展着。同时，这些要求，都是从迫切的生活要求出发的！所以这些要求归根溯源都不可避免地要追查到使南朝鲜人民的生活和生存受到灭亡的威胁的美帝国主义侵略军和它的走狗身上。所以，这些要求或斗争一个也不例外地都要求废除美帝国主义的殖民政策。从而，南朝鲜人民的斗争逐渐地将其中心口号转变成为“美军滚出去！”对！南朝鲜人民的抗争，分明是面对美帝国主义的斗争，同时证明，这一斗争必然要从祖国疆土上赶走美帝国主义侵略军。这一斗争是最后胜利的前奏曲和进行曲。人民越满怀着希望继续前进。但是，美帝国主义以什么来回答人民呢？
    当国际紧张局势缓和并准备召开首脑会议的时候，美帝国主义把“诚实的约翰”和“斗牛士”式火箭导弹等新式武器运进南朝鲜，并进行了各种原子战争的演习。当首脑会议被美帝国主义破坏以后，它又好像抓住了一个好机会，向南朝鲜又进一步伸出了侵略魔掌。现在，美帝国主义公然地叫嚣在南朝鲜进行发动战争的准备，并把侵略远东的经费大部分投入了南朝鲜。
    他们的通讯社还公然的叫嚣，最近把美国的二千名空降部队人员派到了冲绳岛，还说他们能够参加西太平洋地区的局部战争和全面战争。美帝国主义者不顾日本人民和全世界爱好和平人民的一致谴责，以强盗方法制造了美日军事同盟条约，复活日本军国主义，企图把日本当成反对朝鲜、中国和苏联等社会主义国家和亚洲爱好和平人民的新的侵略战争的跳板。与此同时，美帝国主义还企图制造以日本为核心的新的侵略性的“东北亚同盟”，把它从北大西洋公约组织、东南亚条约组织、中央条约组织等美帝国主义操纵下的侵略性军事集团联接在一起。这一切事实证明，美帝国主义者虽然口头上侈谈和平，而在背后却追求新的侵略战争。
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的威力比帝国主义侵略势力无比强大。如果帝国主义者胆敢发动新的侵略战争，即将遭到惨败。
    把一切反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义的和平力量团结起来，揭露和粉碎帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义者的侵略企图，捆紧他们的手脚，使他们不敢轻易发动侵略战争。重要的是：提高警惕，进一步团结一切反对帝国主义，反对殖民主义的力量。
    朝鲜的巩固和和平也在于：只有更加铜墙铁壁般地巩固共和国北部的革命的民主基地，提高警惕，监视敌人的一举一动，团结南北朝鲜的一切爱国主义的力量，从我们祖国的南部赶走美帝国主义侵略者。
    北朝鲜的社会主义大跃进和南朝鲜人民对它的支持和向往，是反对和最后战胜美帝国主义侵略者和他制造的法西斯统治的物质保证。
    南北朝鲜人民确信祖国的统一和真正和平的到来，并为此进行着斗争。
    我们根据这些说：历史变了。但是，变了的决不是帝国主义。
    我们所看到的大转变是：南朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义和它的走狗的英勇的斗争。这是在我们历史发展中的巨大事件。
    我在这里，最后想谈一谈南朝鲜人民斗争的片断——居昌农民的英勇斗争。他们抓住和烧死了十年前屠杀了他们的家属的美帝国主义的走狗。可是，傀儡警察以追查主谋者为借口开始逮捕了一些人。这时有两千农民都高呼自称是主谋者。他们更加团结起来了。所以，美军和傀儡警察也不得不释放了全部被捕的人员。当然，这仅仅是一个小例子，但是，我们可以由此看到任何力量也阻挠不了人民团结的力量。但是，这不是局限于居昌农民中间的事情，而是全体南朝鲜人民的普遍现象，从这里人们可以真正地理解今天南朝鲜人民的英勇斗争。事实上紧接着居昌农民的起义，在山清、咸洋、济州岛、釜山、大丘、达城、盈德、长兴、咸平、长城、潭阳、和顺、梁山、嘉昌、庆山、漆谷、新洞、密阳、南原、淳昌、清州、大田、全州、光州、任实、顺天、忠州、统营、咸安等各地继续爆发了农民起义。
    我想在这里介绍一个农民对这一巨大力量最先爆发的居昌农民起义唱的一首歌子，来看今天的南北朝鲜人民的心情。
    个个是英雄，三千万都是英雄，
    居昌农民团结一致，作出了榜样，
    敌人敲着鼓，向他们进攻。
    该死的人想活也不行，
    凛然的大义，使死亡也不敢靠近他们，
    居昌的二千农民，都是这样的人。
    我们不能相信，同敌人共存，
    美帝国主义无时无刻不用尖刀对着我们同胞的背
      瘠，
    只有使敌人死亡，我们才能活下去。
    同心同德团结的力量能胜天，
    是英雄是好汉都来学居昌，
    三千里江山是一个天下，
    像一个身体，一个家庭。
