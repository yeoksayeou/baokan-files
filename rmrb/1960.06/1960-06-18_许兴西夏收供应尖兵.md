In the Days of Summer Harvest and Summer Planting

    Xu Xing, a pacesetter in summer harvest supply in Xi'an

    The tense battle of the summer harvest has begun, and Comrade Xu Xingxi, a red banner bearer of the means of production department of the Hongqing Commune Store in Baqiao District, Xi'an City, and an advanced worker in the city, is extremely excited. He thought that this year's bumper harvest was a victory over the struggle with nature, and it was not easy. If the summer harvest tools were not adequately prepared, it would be terrible if the harvest was affected. On June 1, the most tense day of the harvest, he took the initiative to ask to deliver goods to the production team. On this day, braving the scorching sun, he ran all over the 19 production teams in the three management areas of Huokou, Chezhanggou, etc., traveling more than ninety miles back and forth, and delivered 372 sickle beds and blades to the wheat harvesters in time. Everyone was moved by his actions and expressed that they would complete the harvesting task ahead of schedule, thresh, dry, and store the grain quickly, to thank the commercial department for its enthusiastic support. This further encouraged Xu Xingxi's enthusiasm. That very evening, he and the eight comrades in the department went to various production teams in the Baimiao and Huangdeng management areas to sell goods door-to-door. He alone ran to four teams and sold more than 70 sickle beds and blades door-to-door.

    许兴西夏收供应尖兵
    夏收紧张的战斗开始了，西安市灞桥区洪庆公社商店生产资料门市部的红旗手、市先进工作者许兴西同志，心情激动极了。他想，今年的丰收是向自然斗争的胜利，可不容易啊，要是万一夏收工具准备不足，影响了收割才不得了。在收割最紧张的六月一日，他主动要求到生产队去送货。这一天，他顶着火热的太阳跑遍了豁口、车丈沟等三个管区的十九个生产队，往返跑了九十多里路，把三百七十二件镰床、刀片及时送到了割麦人的手中。大家都为他的行动所感动，表示一定要提前完成收割任务，快碾、快晒、快入仓、来感谢商业部门的热情支援。这一来更加鼓舞了许兴西的干劲。就在当天晚上，他又和门市部的八个同志分别到白庙、黄邓两个管区的各个生产队叫门售货，他一个人就跑了四个队，叫门售出镰床刀片七十多个。
