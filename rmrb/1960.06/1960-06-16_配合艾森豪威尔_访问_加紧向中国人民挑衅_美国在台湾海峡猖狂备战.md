Xinhua News Agency, 15th: On the eve of Eisenhower's "visit" to Taiwan, U.S. imperialism has been carrying out a series of war deployments and military provocations in the Taiwan Strait.

An Associated Press dispatch from Taipei on the 8th reported that a "mixed air strike force" reassigned to Taiwan by the U.S. Tactical Air Command "will remain on the island throughout President Eisenhower's visit on June 18-19." According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Taipei on the 14th, U.S. and Kuomintang naval and air forces have begun combat deployments. Dean, commander of the U.S. Air Force's 13th Air Force forward command in Taiwan, openly threatened that the "mixed attack force" composed of U.S. Air Force units invading Taiwan could "quickly reach the target area to attack the enemy in the shortest possible time."

Taiwan newspapers reported that before Eisenhower arrived in Taiwan, high-ranking U.S. military personnel and secret agents arrived in Taiwan, Kinmen and other places one after another to conduct activities. U.S. Pacific Air Force Commander General O'Donnell arrived in Taiwan in early June and conducted war deployments with senior U.S. military personnel invading Taiwan. On June 2, Brigadier General Blanchard, the newly appointed deputy head and army group leader of the U.S. Military Advisory Group, went to Kinmen with Luo Lie, the "Commander-in-Chief" of the Chiang army, and gave speeches to the island's Chiang army "senior generals," and "inspected" the Chiang army's positions and fortifications. In addition, U.S. special agent "Father" Max, "U.S. Aid Investment Development Consultant" Little and Johnson, and Haraldson, director of the Taiwan branch of the U.S. International Cooperation Administration, also went to Kinmen in late May and early June to visit military equipment. News also said that a group of U.S. officers and Chiang Kai-shek's troops on Kinmen Island are now "drafting an action plan to cope with emergencies."

U.S. imperialism has also instructed the Chiang Kai-shek clique to step up military provocations. A dispatch from Kaohsiung by the Chiang gang's "Central News Agency" on the 13th said that the Chiang army's navy had "strengthened the preparedness of its ships" and was "now patrolling the Taiwan Strait day and night, maintaining a mobile state, and preparing to fight at any time." The Chiang army's air force has also recently held joint exercises. Taiwan's "New Life Daily" reported on the 5th that "just as Eisenhower is about to visit Taiwan," the Chiang Kai-shek clique "has ordered the three armed forces stationed on the front lines of Kinmen and Matsu and in various parts of the island to actively prepare for war. The front-line islands have entered a state of emergency preparedness."

    配合艾森豪威尔“访问”加紧向中国人民挑衅
    美国在台湾海峡猖狂备战
    新华社15日讯　在艾森豪威尔“访问”台湾的前夕，美帝国主义在台湾海峡进行了一连串的战争部署和军事挑衅活动。
    美联社8日从台北发出的消息说，由美国战术空军司令部增调到台湾的一支“混合空军打击力量”，“将在艾森豪威尔总统6月18—19日整个访问期间留在这个岛上”。据法新社台北14日消息说，美国和国民党的海军和空军部队已展开了战斗部署。美国空军第十三航空队驻台湾前进指挥部司令迪安并且公然威胁说：由侵台美国空军组成的“混合攻击部队，能在最短时间内迅速到达目标区攻击敌人”。
    台湾报纸说，在艾森豪威尔未到台湾以前，美国的高级军事人员和特务们接二连三地到台湾、金门等地进行活动。美国太平洋空军司令奥当纳耳上将6月上旬到达台湾与侵台美军高级军事人员进行了战争部署。6月2日，新到职的美军顾问团副团长兼陆军组长白兰查准将和蒋军陆军“总司令”罗列一起到了金门，并召集岛上的蒋军“高级将领”讲话，“巡视”蒋军的阵地和工事。另外，美国特务“神父”麦斯，“美援投资发展顾问”里特尔和约翰逊、美国国际合作署台湾分署署长哈拉德森，也在5月底和6月初先后前往金门参观军事设备。消息还说，现在在金门岛上的一批美国军官和蒋介石军队“拟订了行动计划，以应付紧急状态”。
    美帝国主义还指使蒋介石集团加紧进行军事挑衅活动。蒋帮“中央社”13日从高雄发出的消息说，蒋军海军已经“加强舰艇备战”，“现正在台湾海峡日夜巡逻，保持机动状态，准备随时作战”。蒋军空军最近也举行了联合演习。台湾“新生报”5日报道，“正当艾森豪威尔即将来台访问之际”，蒋介石集团“业经命令驻防金、马前线以及本岛各地之三军将士积极备战。前线岛屿已进入紧急备战状态”。
