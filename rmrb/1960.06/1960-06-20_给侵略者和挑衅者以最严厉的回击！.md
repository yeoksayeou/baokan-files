    Give the Aggressors and Provocateurs the Most Severe Retaliation!
    Xu Guangping
    Eisenhower, the most ferocious enemy of people worldwide, cannot conceal his sinister purpose in coming to the Far East this time with any amount of flowery words. After the Four-Power Summit was sabotaged, the "peace" mask of U.S. imperialism and Eisenhower has been completely torn off by their own ugly words and deeds. The gangster face of imperialism is nakedly exposed before the people of the world, its reputation is even more tarnished, and its situation is more isolated. At the same time, the storm of struggle stirred up by the people of Asian countries such as Japan, South Korea, and Turkey is becoming stronger and higher, putting U.S. imperialism and its running dogs in a desperate situation. The two lackeys, Syngman Rhee and Menderes, have been forced to step down. It is under these circumstances that Eisenhower insists on coming to the Far East. His arrival does not show how powerful imperialism is, but precisely how terrified and weak they are. He is eager to seize this opportunity to interfere in the internal affairs of various countries, suppress the just struggles of the people of various countries, support those tottering puppet regimes and running dogs, strengthen the position of U.S. imperialism and the rulers of those countries tied to the American war chariot, maintain its aggressive front in Asia to prevent it from collapsing completely, and conspire to use this opportunity to secure the conclusion of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. In addition to the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, he also wants to establish a Northeast Asia aggressive bloc with Japanese militarism as its core, prepare for the United States to launch aggressive wars in the Far East, and aggravate the "Cold War" and tension in the Far East. As for Eisenhower's purpose in going to Taiwan this time, it is even clearer: he wants to use this to strengthen the aggressive policy of hostility towards our people and obstruction of our liberation of Taiwan, and continue to promote the conspiracy to create "two Chinas." It can be asserted that these sinister conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and Eisenhower are doomed to fail.
    The increasingly strong just struggle of the Japanese people has forced Eisenhower to announce the postponement of his "visit" to Japan. At the same time, in the Philippines and South Korea, large-scale struggles against U.S. imperialism and Eisenhower have also been launched. More and more people around the world, especially in Asian countries, are realizing that U.S. imperialism is the deadly enemy of people of all countries, and no illusions should be held about imperialism; only by resolutely fighting against it. The patriotic compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu have suffered oppression and humiliation from U.S. imperialism for many years. All Chinese people with patriotism, who are unwilling to be American running dogs, and unwilling to be enslaved and deceived, should unite and wage a tenacious struggle against the American aggressors. We must not allow Eisenhower and his servants to run rampant and show off their power on our motherland's territory.
    Our people have solemnly declared long ago: Taiwan is our territory, and our people must liberate Taiwan. No matter what tricks Eisenhower plays in Taiwan this time, it cannot shake our people's firm will to liberate Taiwan. The U.S. imperialism's attempt to create "two Chinas" and permanently occupy Taiwan is a barbaric infringement upon our country's sacred territory and sovereignty, and a gross interference in our internal affairs. The large-scale provocative "exercises" conducted by the United States armed forces in the Taiwan Strait and other regions in the Far East, and the various war preparations carried out by the United States in Asia, seriously threaten our country's security and peace in Asia. U.S. imperialism and Eisenhower must bear full responsibility for the consequences of these criminal activities. (Attached picture)

    给侵略者和挑衅者以最严厉的回击！
    许广平
    艾森豪威尔这个全世界人民最凶恶的敌人，这次到远东来的罪恶目的不是任何花言巧语所能掩盖得了的。在四国首脑会议遭到破坏之后，美帝国主义和艾森豪威尔的“和平”画皮已经被自己的丑恶言行完全撕毁了，帝国主义的强盗嘴脸赤裸裸地暴露在全世界人民面前，声名更臭了，处境更孤立了；同时，在日本、南朝鲜、土耳其等亚洲国家人民所掀起的斗争风暴，越来越强烈，越来越高涨，使得美帝国主义和它的走狗们陷入绝境，李承晚和曼德列斯这两个奴才已经被迫滚下了台。正是在这种情况下，艾森豪威尔坚持要到远东来。他这一来，并不能说明帝国主义有多么厉害，而恰恰说明它们是多么惶恐，多么虚弱。他急于要抓住这个机会，干涉各国内政，压制各国人民的正义斗争，为那些摇摇欲坠的傀儡统治和走狗们撑腰打气，以加强美帝国主义和缚在美国战车上的那些国家的统治者的地位，维护它在亚洲的侵略阵线，使它不致全面崩溃，并且阴谋利用这个机会，使日美军事同盟条约获得成立。在东南亚侵略集团之外，又建立以日本军国主义为核心的东北亚侵略集团，为美国在远东发动侵略战争作好准备，并加剧远东的“冷战”和紧张局势。至于艾森豪威尔这次到台湾去的目的，那就更清楚，他想借此加强敌视我国人民和阻挠我们解放台湾的侵略政策，继续推行制造“两个中国”的阴谋。可以断言，美帝国主义和艾森豪威尔的这些罪恶阴谋是注定要失败的。
    日本人民日益强大的正义斗争已经迫使艾森豪威尔宣布延期“访问”日本。同时，在菲律宾，在南朝鲜，也都掀起了声势浩大的反对美帝国主义和反对艾森豪威尔的斗争。世界人民特别是亚洲各国人民，越来越多的人都认识到美帝国主义是各国人民的死敌，对于帝国主义，绝不能存有任何幻想；只有坚决对它进行斗争。在台、澎、金、马的爱国同胞，多年来受尽了美帝国主义的压迫和屈辱。一切有爱国心、不甘做美国走狗、不甘让人奴役和欺骗的中国人，都该团结起来，同美国侵略者进行顽强的斗争，决不容许艾森豪威尔和他的仆从们在我们祖国的土地上恣意横行，耀武扬威。
    我国人民早经庄严宣布：台湾是我国的领土，我国人民一定要解放台湾。不论艾森豪威尔这次到台湾耍弄什么花招，都丝毫不能动摇我国人民一定要解放台湾的坚强意志。美帝国主义妄想制造“两个中国”和永久霸占台湾，是对我国神圣领土、主权的野蛮侵犯，是对我国内政的粗暴干涉；美国武装在台湾海峡和远东其他地区进行大规模挑衅性的“演习”，美国在亚洲所进行的各种备战活动，都严重地威胁我国安全和亚洲的和平。美帝国主义和艾森豪威尔必须对这些罪恶活动的后果负完全责任。（附图片）
