Xinhua News Agency report: In Jiangxi Province, people's communes are launching a high tide of field management centered on topdressing, overcoming the extremely unfavorable effects of prolonged rain and low temperatures on the growth of early rice seedlings, and ensuring a comprehensive bumper harvest of early rice. Now, from the Nanling Mountains to Poyang Lake, everything is lush green, and most of the seedlings have begun to tiller and close ranks, with first- and second-class seedlings accounting for more than 80%.

This year, Jiangxi Province suffered eight cold waves and more than a month of continuous rain from the time of soaking and sowing early rice seeds until transplanting, resulting in congenital deficiencies. After the early rice seedlings were transplanted, the weather still did not clear up and warm up, which affected the normal growth of the seedlings. In order to overcome this unprecedented bad weather in the past ten years, the five million members of the people's communes in Jiangxi, after successfully completing the task of expanding early rice planting, also launched a battle with "Heaven," and put forward the fighting slogan of "Make up for congenital deficiencies with acquired advantages; if heaven doesn't grow crops, people will." Aiming at the characteristics of prolonged rain, low temperature, little sunshine, and slow tillering of yellow and thin seedlings, they quickly launched a high tide of field management production centered on topdressing and attacking the early rice tillering stage.

This year, there is a lot of rain, and after fertilizers are applied, they are often washed away by rainwater with little effect. Therefore, a battle to seize fertilizer from the sky has rapidly unfolded throughout the province. In the vast mountainous areas, people actively improve irrigation conditions, digging ditches for drainage on the sides of "over-water fields" to turn "over-water fields" into "sitting-water fields," so that the flowing water no longer passes through the fields and takes away fertilizer. In the plains, fertilization methods have also been improved to ensure that fertilizer is not washed away.

People's communes in various places have actively strengthened the leadership of field management work, improved field management methods, and set up "field hospitals" in the fields, headed by the secretary, and adopted a method of combining cadres, veteran farmers, and technicians to "diagnose and treat" the seedlings and promptly solve the problems that arise during the growth of the seedlings. In the Ganzhou area, people's communes have set up more than 40,000 "field hospitals" in the fields with 700,000 people, carefully nursing the seedlings, and inspecting, diagnosing, prescribing, and treating the seedlings hill by hill and stalk by stalk every day, with very good results.

Xinhua News Agency report: Zhejiang Province is fully mobilizing the masses, concentrating its main forces, and vigorously grasping early rice cultivation, accelerating the progress of weeding, accumulating fertilizer, and applying fertilizer, and attacking the tillering stage.

The early rice field management high-standard competition movement, centered on weeding, topdressing, ensuring full seedlings, and strong seedlings, has been launched vigorously throughout the province. Various localities are taking effective measures to vigorously attack the early rice tillering stage, and strive to ensure that there are no weeds, no fertilizer deficiency, no missing plants, no water shortage, and no pests and diseases in the fields. As of May 23, 87.6% of the early rice in the province had been weeded and topdressed once, and 51% of the early rice had been weeded and topdressed twice. This has laid a good foundation for a comprehensive and high yield of early rice.

Leaders at all levels and the vast number of cadres have vigorously grasped ideology and measures in early rice field management, and greatly boosted their morale through summary appraisals and field rectification. More than 21,000 cadres and more than 70,000 commune members from Qingtian, Taishun, Huangyan, and Linhai counties in the Wenzhou area participated in the general inspection of field management.

In early rice field management, various localities have also promoted a large number of new-style tools, which has greatly accelerated the progress of early rice field management, and the quality has also been significantly improved. At present, more than 600,000 pieces of various weeding tools and rotary cultivators such as six-row, three-row, iron movable, drum-type, and shoe-brush type have been promoted and used throughout the province. The efficiency of these tools is generally two to ten times higher than that of manual operation.

Changsha, this newspaper, 1st dispatch: In early rice field management, Hunan Province has strengthened the Party's leadership, promoted advanced technical measures, topdressed early, and cultivated early, doing everything possible to promote early maturity and high yield of early rice. As of May 18, of the 33 million mu of early rice in the province, more than 11 million mu had been topdressed with fertilizer for the first time, and more than 7 million mu had been cultivated for the first time. At present, the vast majority of early rice has returned to green and is tillering.

The task of transplanting early rice in Hunan Province was completed in early May. During the period of transplanting early rice, Party committees at all levels took some revolutionary measures and insisted on planting and managing at the same time, which played a great role in shortening the greening period of early rice and restoring normal growth. However, due to the several cold waves that hit the province this year, the transplanting time was delayed. After transplanting, many places encountered several low temperatures, storms, and floods. In order to overcome various natural disasters, promote early maturity and high yield of early rice, and ensure the timely sowing and transplanting of late rice and autumn miscellaneous crops according to the season, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China promptly put forward the battle slogan of "Improving the level of field management and promoting early maturity and high yield of early rice" and strengthened the leadership of field management work. Zhang Pinghua, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, and Secretaries Zhou Hui and Hu Jizong have all gone deep into the fields to help local cadres and the masses summarize their experiences and improve the level of field management. Party committees at all levels have also strengthened the leadership of field management work.

In order to implement the technical measures of early topdressing and early cultivation, the province launched a mass movement of large-scale collection and cleanup after the completion of early rice transplanting, and first applied all kinds of fertilizers currently available at home; at the same time, it is launching a large-scale summer fertilizer accumulation movement. The province has universally promoted the advanced technology of diligent drainage and shallow irrigation and moist irrigation, and combined with cultivation and topdressing, it has also carried out a blitz insect control campaign. In the early rice field management work, various localities have carried out a tool reform movement. At present, there are more than 2.6 million laborers in the province participating in professional field management.

Fuzhou, this newspaper, 2nd dispatch: The main summer harvest crop, early rice, in Fujian Province is growing vigorously, and early rice in the southern region, where the season is earlier, has already headed and flowered.

This year's early rice in Fujian is not only planted more, but also managed well and growing vigorously. The planting area of early rice reaches 9 million mu, an increase of nearly 40% compared with the same season last year. The planting quality is also higher than in previous years, achieving deep plowing and fine harrowing, more base fertilizer, and the universal promotion of close planting and standardization. At present, most localities have concentrated 50% to 80% of the labor force, accumulating and producing large quantities of fertilizer, applying concentrated and quick-acting fertilizers and soil fertilizers, while strengthening cultivation, weeding, and disaster prevention and resistance. By the end of May, more than 75% of the early rice in the province had been topdressed, cultivated, and weeded once, and more than 40% had been treated two to three times. According to the comparison of more than 1.74 million mu of early rice in Nanping, Longyan, Longxi Prefectures, and Xiamen suburbs, first- and second-class seedlings account for about 90%.

This year, the area of high-yield and high-yielding early rice fields in the province is very large, generally reaching about 30% of the total area, and some reaching 50% to 60%. In order to enable high-yielding fields and general fields to achieve balanced high yields and achieve a comprehensive bumper harvest, various localities have organized professional teams for high-yielding fields, professional teams for remote and low-yielding fields, and remote cultivation teams, and frequently strengthened field management and launched competition movements.

Recently, there has been a lot of rain in Fujian, and various localities have strengthened the struggle against rain, flood prevention, and the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests.

    先天不足后天补　天不长禾人长禾
    江西浙江湖南精心培育受害的早稻
    福建以追肥除草防灾为中心加强早稻管理
    据新华社讯　江西省各人民公社掀起以追肥为中心的田间管理生产高潮，战胜了久雨低温给早稻禾苗生长带来极其不利的影响，确保早稻全面大丰收。现在，从南岭到波阳湖，到处是一片葱绿，大部分禾苗已经开始分蘖封行，一、二类苗达80％以上。
    今年，江西省从早稻浸种、播种直到插秧，连续遭到八次寒潮袭击和连续一个多月的阴雨侵扰，致使先天不足。早稻插秧后天气仍不放晴转暖，又影响了禾苗正常生长。为战胜这种十年来前所未有的恶劣气候，江西五百万人民公社社员在胜利完成了早稻扩种任务后，又与“天公”展开了搏斗，提出了“先天不足后天补，天不长禾人长禾”的战斗口号，针对久雨低温日照少，禾苗黄瘦分蘖慢的特点，迅速掀起了一个以追肥为中心，猛攻早稻分蘖关的田间管理生产高潮。
    今年雨水多，肥料追施以后，往往都被雨水冲散流失，收效不大，因而一场与天夺肥的战斗又在全省迅速展开。在广大山区，人们积极改善灌溉条件，在“过水田”边开沟排水，使“过水田”变为“坐水田”，使流水不再从田中经过，带走肥料。在平原地区也改善了施肥方法，保证肥料不被冲失。
    各地人民公社都积极加强了田间管理工作的领导，改进了田间管理的方法，并以书记为首在田间广设“田头医院”，采取干部、老农、技术员三结合的办法，给禾苗“会诊看病”，及时解决禾苗生长过程中出现的问题。赣南地区各人民公社有七十万人在田间办起了四万多个“田头医院”，细心护理禾苗，每天逐丘逐蔸对禾苗进行检查、诊断、开方、治疗，效果很好。
    据新华社讯　浙江省各地正在充分发动群众，集中主要力量，大抓早稻培育、加快耘田、积肥、施肥进度，猛攻发棵关。
    以耘田、追肥、全苗、壮苗为中心的早稻田间管理高标准竞赛运动，已在全省轰轰烈烈地展开。各地正采取有效措施，猛攻早稻发棵关，力争田间无杂草、无脱肥、无缺株、无缺水、无病虫。到5月23日止，全省已经有87．6％的早稻耘田追肥一次，有51％的早稻耘田追肥二次。这为早稻全面高产打下了良好的基础。
    各级领导和广大干部，在早稻田间管理中，大抓思想，大抓措施，通过总结评比，田头整风，大鼓干劲。温州专区青田、泰顺、黄岩、临海等四县有二万一千多干部、七万多社员参加了田间管理大检查。
    各地在早稻田间管理中，还推广了大批的新式工具，使早稻田间管理的进度大大加快，质量也有显著提高。目前，全省已推广使用的六行式、三行式、铁制活动式、滚筒式、鞋刷式等各种耘田器和中耕锄六十多万件，这些工具的工效一般比双手操作提高两倍到十多倍。
    本报长沙1日电　湖南省在早稻田间管理中，加强党的领导，推广先进技术措施，早追肥、早中耕，千方百计促使早稻早熟高产。到5月18日，全省三千三百万亩早稻，有一千一百多万亩追了第一次肥料，有七百多万亩进行了第一次中耕。目前，绝大部分的早稻都已回青分蘖。
    湖南省的早稻插秧任务已在5月初完成。在早稻插秧期间，各级党委就采取了一些具有革命性的措施，坚持边播边管，对缩短早稻回青期、恢复正常生长起了很大的作用。但是，由于今年全省遭受了几次寒潮的侵袭，推迟了插秧时间，插秧以后，许多地方又接连遇到了几次低温和狂风暴雨以及洪水等的侵袭。为了战胜各种自然灾害，促使早稻早熟高产，并保证晚稻和秋杂作物按季节及时播种、插秧，中共湖南省委及时提出了“提高田间管理水平，促使早稻早熟高产”的战斗口号和加强了对田间管理工作的领导。省委第一书记张平化，书记周惠、胡继宗等都先后深入田间，帮助当地干部群众总结经验，提高田间管理水平。各级党委也都加强了对田间管理工作的领导。
    为了贯彻早追肥、早中耕的技术措施，全省在早稻插秧结束后，通过一个大搜集、大扫除的群众运动，首先把家里现存的各种肥料全部追施下去；同时，正在开展一次大规模的夏季积肥运动。全省普遍推广了勤排浅灌和湿润灌溉的先进技术，结合中耕追肥，还开展了一次突击治虫运动。在早稻田间管理工作中各地都开展了工具改革运动。现在，全省参加专业田间管理的劳动力已有二百六十多万个。
    本报福州2日电　福建省夏收主要作物早稻生长茁壮，季节较早的南部地区的早稻已经抽穗扬花。
    福建今年的早稻不仅种的多，而且管的好、长的旺。早稻种植面积达九百万亩，比去年同季扩大近40％。种植质量也较往年高，作到深犁细耙，基肥多，并普遍推广了密植规格化。目前各地一般都集中了50％到80％的劳动力，大积、大造肥料，大追精肥、速效肥和土化肥等，同时加强了中耕除草和防灾抗灾斗争。到5月底，全省早稻追肥、中耕、除草一遍的有75％以上，两次到三次的有40％多。据南平、龙岩、龙溪专区和厦门郊区等一百七十四万多亩早稻排队比较情况来看，一、二类苗占90％左右。
    今年全省早稻高额丰产田的面积很大，一般都达到总面积的30％左右，有的达50％到60％。为了使高产田和一般田能够均衡高产，实现全面大丰收，各地都组织了丰产田专业队，边远田、低产田专业队和远耕队，经常加强田间管理，展开竞赛运动。
    近来，福建多雨，各地加强了防雨、防汛和防治病虫害的斗争。
