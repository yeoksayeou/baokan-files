(Reported by this newspaper) In the summer hoeing campaign in Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, more than 6,600 cadres at the county, commune, district, and team levels, led by the first secretaries of the Party committees at all levels, converged in the fields, living, eating, and working alongside commune members. They conducted thorough and practical work, promptly promoted advanced experiences, solved key problems in production, helped backward areas catch up with advanced ones, and accelerated the progress of summer hoeing. The daily progress of summer hoeing shovels in the county steadily increased. By June 14th, all two million mu of cultivated crops had been hoed for the first time despite the rainy conditions, three days earlier than the previous year, which was affected by spring drought.

Comrade Zhao Jiazeng, the first secretary of the County Party Committee, after going to the Democratic Management Area of the Gucheng Commune, discovered that the fourth team was using animal-powered improved weeding machines for hoeing. Due to insufficient animal power, only four sets of plows were used, hoeing 150 mu of land per day, with only 90 mu being smoothed. Hoeing and smoothing were disconnected. After studying, they decided to combine the animal power and change the single plow operation to a multiple plow operation. A five-horse carriage could carry three plows, saving four horses compared to a single plow operation. After implementing this method, the whole team could use seven plows every day, solving the contradiction of disconnected hoeing and smoothing. After discovering this experience, Comrade Zhao Jiazeng believed that this was not only a good way to solve the disconnection between hoeing and smoothing but also the key to ensuring improved tools and achieving more hoeing and smoothing. In order to further promote the Gucheng experience, Secretary Zhao summoned the first secretaries of the neighboring Henan, Hebei, and Keshan Town communes to visit Gucheng. After vigorously promoting the Gucheng experience throughout the county, in three days, the number of improved tools used throughout the county increased sharply from 2,157 to 7,039, and the daily progress of land hoeing in the county increased from 52,000 mu to 270,000 mu, and the daily progress of land smoothing increased from 35,000 mu to 150,000 mu.

Leading cadres of Keshan County also went to remote and backward areas to strengthen leadership over weak links. The progress of the Beilian Commune in preparing for and spring plowing had always been slow. At the beginning of summer hoeing, County Party Secretary Wang Di went to this commune to help change the situation. Comrade Wang Di, together with the commune Party secretary, went to the Xinxin Management Area, which had less labor and more land, to set an example. Each laborer in this management area was responsible for hoeing 140 mu of planted crops, which normally required 27 days to hoe for the first time. Comrade Wang Di and the cadres and commune members jointly studied and focused on the main link of giving full play to the role of improved tools. After five days of concentrated effort, the entire area produced 48 improved weeding machines of various models. Among them, the three-ridge weeding machine, converted from a horse-drawn seeder, was operated by two people and could hoe 75 mu of land per day, equivalent to the workload of 15 laborers per day. All 48 improved tools in the entire area were contracted by cadres, and they were all put into use on May 24th. By May 30th, in just seven days, they took the lead in the county and completed the first hoeing task on 11,000 mu of land. The miracle created by the Xinxin Management Area shocked the entire commune, and skilled craftsmen throughout the commune worked day and night to convert 480 improved weeding machines and put them into summer hoeing. Comrade Wang Di also personally went to the canteen as a waiter to help the canteen improve its hygiene and improve its food. The commune Party committee also strengthened the leadership of the commune's health and welfare work, ensuring the health of the labor force and inspiring the commune members' enthusiasm for labor. As a result, the Beilian Commune became the first in the county to complete the first hoeing task on May 13th. Due to the strengthening of leadership over backward areas and teams, in the first hoeing and smoothing, the Beilian and Hebei communes and 27 management areas in the county had jumped from the downstream position during spring plowing to the upstream position.

    克山县各级党委书记到夏锄第一线
    总结经验，推广新式农具，帮助后进地区，加快夏锄进度
    本报讯　黑龙江克山县在夏锄运动中，各级党委第一书记带领县、社、区、队几级干部六千六百多人，到田间会师，和社员们同吃同住同劳动，深入踏实地工作，及时推广先进经验，解决生产中的关键问题，帮助后进地区赶上先进，加快了夏锄进度，全县夏锄铲的日进度节节上升，到6月14日全县二百万亩中耕作物在多雨情况下铲完头遍，比春旱的去年提前了三天。
    县委第一书记赵稼增同志深入到古城公社民主管理区后，发现四队用畜力牵引改良锄草机锄草，因畜力不足，只出四副趟犁，每天锄草一百五十亩，只能趟九十亩。铲趟脱节。大家研究把畜力合起来用，改单犁作业为多犁作业，五马拉车能带三副犁，比单犁作业能省四匹马。实行这个办法后，全队每天能出七副犁，解决铲趟脱节的矛盾。赵稼增同志发现这一经验后，认为这不仅是解决铲趟脱节的好办法，也是保证改良工具和实现多铲多趟的关键。为了进一步推广古城经验，赵书记召集临近的河南、河北、克山镇等公社的第一书记到古城参观。全县大张旗鼓推广古城经验后，三天时间，全县改良工具使用数由二千一百五十七台猛增至七千零三十九台，全县铲地日进度由五万二千亩增至二十七万亩，趟地日进度由三万五千亩增至十五万亩。
    克山县领导干部还深入边远和后进地区，加强对薄弱环节的领导。北联公社在备耕、春耕中，生产进度一直较慢。夏锄一开始，县委书记王地同志到这个公社帮助转变局面。王地同志和公社党委书记一道，深入劳力少土地多的西新管理区搞点。这个管理区每个劳力负担铲槎作物一百四十亩，按常年作法，需二十七天铲完头遍地。王地同志和干部社员共同研究，紧紧抓住发挥改良工具作用这一主要环节，经过五天突击，全区造出四十八台各种型号改良锄草机，其中用马拉播种机改装的三垅锄草机用两人操作，一天能锄草七十五亩，相当于十五个劳力一天的工作量。全区四十八台改良工具，台台由干部包干，5月24日全部使用，到5月30日，七天时间，即在全县一马当先，完成一万一千亩地头遍锄草任务。西新管理区创造的奇迹，震动了全公社，全社能工巧匠昼夜突击，改制了四百八十台改良锄草机，投入夏锄。王地同志还亲自到食堂当服务员，帮助食堂改进卫生面貌，改善饭菜。公社党委也加强对全公社卫生福利工作的领导，保证劳动大军身体健康，鼓舞了社员劳动积极性，结果北联公社5月13日在全县第一个完成了头遍锄草任务。由于加强对后进区、队的领导，在头遍铲趟中，全县已有北联、河北两个公社和二十七个管理区由春耕期间的下游地位跃居上游。（附图片）
