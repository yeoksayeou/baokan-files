Xinhua News Agency, Kampala, June 25th: British colonialists are intensifying their troop deployments to threaten the imminent independence of the Congo. According to a public announcement by the British colonial authorities in Uganda, an African Rifle Company and a special police force have moved towards the border region between Uganda and the Congo. The British colonial authorities occupying Central Africa have also recently massed troops on the Congolese border under the pretext of suppressing African national movements in the Northern Rhodesia region adjacent to southern Congo.

    据新华社25日讯坎帕拉消息：英国殖民主义者正加紧派兵威胁即将独立的刚果。据东非乌干达英国殖民当局公开宣布，一个非洲步枪连和一支特别警察部队已经向乌干达和刚果接壤的边境地区移动。霸占在中非的英国殖民当局最近也曾以镇压北罗得西亚同刚果南部相邻地区的非洲民族运动为名，向刚果边境大量集结军队。
