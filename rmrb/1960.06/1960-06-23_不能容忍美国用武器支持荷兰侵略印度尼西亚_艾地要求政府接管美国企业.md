Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 21st: The Indonesian newspaper "People's Daily" reported today that in view of the fact that American imperialism is currently openly allowing the Dutch to use American weapons in West Irian to carry out aggression against the Indonesian people, the Chairman of the Indonesian Communist Party, D.N. Aidit, yesterday sent a telegram to the Indonesian Cabinet, demanding the takeover of American enterprises.

The telegram stated that the Indonesian Communist Party requests the Indonesian government to take over all American enterprises in Indonesia in accordance with the Political Manifesto of the Republic of Indonesia, until the US government prohibits the use of its weapons and other means of war in West Irian. The telegram pointed out that tolerating the Dutch use of American weapons in West Irian is tantamount to allowing the United States to slaughter the Indonesian people.

The telegram also requested the Indonesian government to implement measures to nationalize all Dutch capital within Indonesia, including Dutch capital in joint ventures, because the Dutch are stubbornly trying to strengthen their military position in West Irian.

    不能容忍美国用武器支持荷兰侵略印度尼西亚
    艾地要求政府接管美国企业
    新华社雅加达21日电　印度尼西亚“人民日报”今天报道，印度尼西亚共产党主席艾地鉴于美帝国主义目前公开允许荷兰人在西伊里安使用美国武器来对印度尼西亚人民进行侵略，昨天打电报给印度尼西亚内阁，要求接管美国企业。
    电报说，印度尼西亚共产党要求印度尼西亚政府按照印度尼西亚共和国政治宣言，接管美国在印度尼西亚的所有企业，直到美国政府禁止在西伊里安使用它的武器和其他战争手段时为止。电报指出，容忍荷兰在西伊里安使用美国武器，就等于容许美国屠杀印度尼西亚人民。
    电报还要求印度尼西亚政府，贯彻把印度尼西亚境内所有的荷兰资本，包括在联合企业中的荷兰资本收归国有的措施，因为荷兰人在顽固地力图加强它在西伊里安的军事地位。
