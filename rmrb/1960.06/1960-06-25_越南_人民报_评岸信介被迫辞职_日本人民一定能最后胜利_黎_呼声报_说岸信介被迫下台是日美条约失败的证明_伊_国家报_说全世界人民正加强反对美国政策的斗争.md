Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 24th: The "People's Daily" today published a commentary on Nobusuke Kishi's announcement of his resignation, stating that Kishi's resignation is a new victory for the Japanese working class and people in their struggle for peace, democracy, and national independence.

The commentary pointed out that Kishi's resignation is the result of several years of resolute and heroic struggle by the Japanese working class and people, and the result of the high tide of the anti-American and anti-Kishi struggle launched by the Japanese people to oppose Eisenhower's "visit" to Japan.

The commentary pointed out that Kishi's forced resignation is only one of the goals achieved by the Japanese working class and people in their struggle. The Japanese working class and people will never recognize the new Japan-U.S. military treaty that Kishi secretly exchanged "instruments of ratification" with the United States. The Japanese Communist Party and various Japanese patriotic organizations have announced that they will continue to wage a strong struggle with the people of all strata in Japan to abolish the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The commentary said that as long as they continue to advance in the right direction, carry forward the recent victories, further strengthen unity, wage a strong struggle, and adhere to the national and democratic united front against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, the heroic Japanese people will surely achieve final victory.

The commentary said that the Vietnamese working class and people resolutely support the new struggle of the Japanese people, and resolutely stand shoulder to shoulder with the Japanese people to continue the struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance, against the aggression and war plots of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs.

The "People's Daily" published a commentary on June 23rd on U.S. President Eisenhower's trip to the Far East, saying, "The people of Asia fully realize from Eisenhower's trip that they must constantly be vigilant against the aggression and war plots of U.S. imperialism."

The newspaper believes that an anti-American united front has been formed in Asia and is continuing to develop. The people of Asia fully realize that unity and perseverance in struggle are invincible forces to defeat any imperialism.

The commentary pointed out: "U.S. imperialism must get out of Asia! This is the common slogan of the Asian people."

Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, June 23rd: The Lebanese "Al-Hayat" published an article today saying that the Japanese people's struggle will eventually be victorious with the result of tearing up the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," because the people of the world and all forces of freedom and peace are supporting and sympathizing with the Japanese people's just struggle against this treaty.

The newspaper said, "In the face of widespread anger among the Japanese people, Kishi's resignation seems inevitable." The newspaper pointed out that Kishi's resignation itself "is proof of the failure of this treaty." The newspaper pointed out, "Kishi and U.S. imperialism insisted on signing this treaty at all costs, which is a huge threat not only to the Japanese people but also to peace in the region. Because the purpose of this treaty is to tighten the United States' control over Japan, expand U.S. military bases in Japan, and use these bases to carry out aggression against other countries."

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, June 22nd: The Iraqi "Al-Jumhuriya" published a commentary on June 22nd on the failure of Eisenhower's "visit" to the Far East, saying that this "visit" was a blow to the policy of the United States, which is increasingly hated by the people of the world, and the people of the world are strengthening the struggle against American policy. The commentary said that Eisenhower's "visit" was carried out under tight security, which shows that the people in these places regard this American leader, who intensifies the Cold War and creates international crises, as an enemy.

The newspaper added that the failure of this "visit" shows that the reputation of the United States is declining in the eyes of the world.

The newspaper said that what is worse is that Eisenhower could not even "visit" Japan, a country connected with U.S. imperialism and ruled by a group headed by an imperialist agent. (Attached picture)

In the anti-American patriotic struggle, the Japanese people raised the demand for "returning Okinawa Island." This is the large-scale parade held by the Japanese people on April 28th this year, demanding that the United States return Okinawa Island and opposing the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

This parade traveled 2,500 kilometers in 96 days from Kagoshima in the south to Tokyo. Xinhua News Agency Draft

    越南“人民报”评岸信介被迫辞职
    日本人民一定能最后胜利
    黎“呼声报”说岸信介被迫下台是日美条约失败的证明
    伊“国家报”说全世界人民正加强反对美国政策的斗争
    新华社河内24日电　“人民报”今天就岸信介宣布下台发表评论指出，岸信介的下台是日本工人阶级和人民在为和平、民主、民族独立的斗争中取得的一个新胜利。
    评论指出，岸信介的下台，是日本工人阶级和人民几年来坚决和英勇斗争的结果，是日本人民为反对艾森豪威尔“访问”日本而掀起的反美反岸斗争高潮的结果。
    评论指出，岸信介被迫宣布下台，仅是日本工人阶级和人民达到自己的斗争目标之一。日本工人阶级和人民决不承认岸信介偷偷地同美国交换了“批准书”的新日美军事条约。日本共产党和日本各爱国团体已经宣布将同日本各阶层人民继续进行强烈的斗争，以废除新日美“安全条约”。
    评论说，只要继续遵循正确的方向前进，发扬最近取得的胜利，进一步加强团结进行强烈的斗争，坚持反对美帝国主义及其走狗的民族、民主统一战线，英勇的日本人民一定会取得最后的胜利。
    评论说，越南工人阶级和人民坚决支持日本人民的新的斗争，坚决同日本人民并肩一起，继续进行反对日美军事同盟、反对美帝国主义及其走狗的侵略和战争阴谋的斗争。
    “人民报”23日就美国总统艾森豪威尔远东之行发表评论说，“亚洲人民从艾森豪威尔此行中充分认识到必须对美帝国主义的侵略和战争阴谋不断提高警惕。”
    这家报纸认为，反美统一战线已经在亚洲形成，并且正在继续发展。亚洲人民充分认识到，团结一致，坚持斗争，是战胜任何帝国主义的无敌力量。
    评论指出：美帝国主义必须滚出亚洲！这是亚洲人民的共同的口号”。
    新华社贝鲁特23日电　黎巴嫩“呼声报”今天发表文章说，日本人民的斗争最后终将以撕毁新日美“安全条约”的结果而获得胜利，因为全世界的人民和一切自由与和平力量都在支持和同情日本人民反对这项条约的正义斗争。
    这家报纸说，“在日本人民普遍愤怒的情况下，岸信介的辞职看来已是不可避免”。报纸指出，岸信介的辞职本身“就是这个条约失败的证明”。这家报纸指出，“岸信介和美帝国主义不顾一切硬要签订这个条约，不仅对日本人民而且对这个地区的和平是巨大的威胁。因为这个条约的目的是加紧美国对日本的控制，扩大美国在日本的军事基地以及利用这些基地对其他国家进行侵略。”
    新华社巴格达22日电　伊拉克“国家报”22日就艾森豪威尔“访问”远东遭到失败发表评论说，这次“访问”是对日益遭到全世界人民痛恨的美国的政策的一个打击，全世界人民正在加强反对美国政策的斗争。评论说，艾森豪威尔的“访问”是在警卫森严的情况下进行的，这表明这些地方的人民把这个加剧冷战、制造国际危机的美国首脑当作敌人看待。
    报纸又说，这次“访问”的失败表明，美国的声誉在世界面前日益下降。
    这家报纸说，更糟的是，艾森豪威尔竟不能“访问”日本这个同美帝国主义联系着的、而且由一个以帝国主义代理人为首的集团统治着的国家。（附图片）
    日本人民在反美爱国斗争中，提出了“归还冲绳岛”的要求。这是今年四月二十八日日本人民举行的要求美国归还冲绳岛、反对日美军事同盟条约的大游行。
    这次大游行队伍，经过二千五百公里的路程，历时九十六天，从南部的鹿儿岛到达东京。　新华社稿
