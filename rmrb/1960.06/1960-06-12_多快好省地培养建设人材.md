Cultivating and Building Talent Quickly, Efficiently, and Economically
Representative of the State-owned Tianjin Electrical Appliance Factory, Ye Maolin

	For more than a year, the in-depth development of teaching reform in our factory has strongly promoted the great development and great improvement of employee education. By 1959, our factory had established an educational system consisting of 68 classes ranging from elementary school to university. The enrollment rate of employees reached 98.2%, and the attendance rate remained stable above 90%. Comparing the cultural level of all employees in 1960 with 1958, those with a university degree increased from 3.15% to 11.2%, those with a technical secondary school and high school degree increased from 13.72% to 49.7%, those with a junior high school degree decreased from 42.09% to 20.4%, and those with a primary school degree also decreased from 39.79% to 19.89%. The illiteracy rate, which accounted for 1.25% of the employees, was completely eliminated in April 1960. The rapid improvement of the political, cultural, and technical level of all employees has become an important driving force for promoting the continuous leap forward in production in our factory. Taking 1957 as 100, the total output value of our factory was 363 in 1958 and 498 in 1959. The planned total output value for 1960 is 78% higher than in 1959.
	For more than a year, we have mainly done the following work in teaching reform:

	Exposing the Phenomena of "Less, Slower, Worse, and More Expensive" in Teaching Work

	The specific opinions of employees on teaching work are: First, the length of schooling is too long. Some workers criticized the spare-time school for "only seeing the opening ceremony and not the graduation ceremony." Second, the teaching plan is divorced from production, what is used is not taught, and what is taught is not used. Third, the teaching method is divorced from the original foundation of the workers and divorced from production reality.
	After the Party committee mobilized the masses to expose the phenomena of "less, slower, worse, and more expensive" in teaching, it felt that teaching reform must be carried out. At the same time, it was believed that the main problems in teaching work were the failure to combine with production and the failure to teach students according to their aptitude, but simply copying the set of full-time schools in isolation from reality. The root cause of these problems was that the Party's education policy had not been implemented, and we had not yet been liberated from the shackles of bourgeois educational thought. Therefore, to carry out teaching reform, it is necessary to deeply develop the struggle between the two roads and the two ideologies, and carry out the ideological revolution of promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology.

	Adhering to Putting Politics in Command and Strengthening Political and Ideological Work

	The proposal of teaching reform problems caused a great ideological fluctuation among teaching staff. In the early stage of teaching reform, ideological struggle was the most intense. Some people said that they "cannot lead education work and do not understand the business." They believed that the original set was very good, and it was formed after hundreds of years of practice. Changing it would destroy the scientific system. Some people also disagreed with using the calculation problems in production as examples for teaching mathematics. When it came to accelerating the training of talents, some said, "Learning can only be done step by step, there are no shortcuts to find," "If it is too fast, the quality cannot be guaranteed," and other erroneous arguments. At this time, the measures taken by the Party committee in political and ideological work, in addition to paying close attention to ideological trends and analyzing and studying them in a timely manner, were mainly to organize learning and physical labor.
	First, it organized all teaching staff to repeatedly study the Party's education policy, called on everyone to open their minds and engage in great debates. The leadership took the Party's general line and education policy as a yardstick, deeply mobilized the masses, established and promoted correct understanding, criticized and overcame erroneous understanding, and analyzed and criticized bourgeois viewpoints one by one, greatly improving the awareness of all teaching staff. At the same time, due to the lack of practice, some people still had many concerns. How to change it? How to combine it with production? What if we don't understand production? The teachers raised a series of new questions. In order to solve these problems, we organized teaching staff to go to workshops to participate in labor, further transform their thinking in labor, and improve their consciousness and enthusiasm for teaching reform.
	Participating in labor in the workshop is a new subject for teachers from intellectual backgrounds, and there is also an ideological struggle here. This struggle is a process of criticizing and overcoming the bourgeois ideas of despising labor and despising working people. Teachers not only took production classes in labor, but also took political classes. They gradually became familiar with production. At the same time, they saw that workers were full of energy, but the lack of certain scientific and cultural knowledge limited their ability to play a greater role (that is, because they could not calculate, they could not bring out a lot of valuable experience). Therefore, they further acknowledged the shortcomings of teaching being divorced from production and the necessity of carrying out teaching reform. More importantly, teachers deeply felt in labor that workers were more knowledgeable than themselves in practical production knowledge. They began to change their views on workers; they began to realize that workers with rich production experience could learn in another shortcut instead of following the original schooling system. These further paved the way ideologically for teaching reform.

	Strengthening Investigation and Research, Grasping the Characteristics of Workers, and Implementing the Principle of "Combining Production and Teaching Students According to Their Aptitude"
	To change the phenomenon of teaching work being divorced from production and divorced from reality, it is necessary to implement the principle of "combining production and teaching students according to their aptitude." However, what are the requirements of production for education work? What kind of "material" are our teaching objects? Teachers have no idea in their minds and need to conduct investigation and research. We first investigated the situation of veteran workers above the fourth grade. The survey results show that the actual knowledge level of veteran workers far exceeds their academic qualifications (generally only read higher elementary school). In many years of production practice, they have explored and actually applied a lot of basic cultural knowledge and advanced scientific and technical principles. This knowledge actually involves many courses in junior high school, high school, and university. In terms of professional craft knowledge, it has reached the level of university. Because they have mastered this knowledge, they can solve process problems, carry out certain designs and simple calculations, and continuously innovate technology. What they lack is theoretical knowledge and calculation methods. In general, the knowledge mastered by veteran workers has the characteristics of "one more and one less." That is, in terms of professional knowledge, there is more process knowledge and less theoretical calculation; in terms of professional and cultural basic knowledge, there is more knowledge of phenomena and less mastery of principles; in mathematics, there is geometry, less trigonometry, and a lack of algebra. These characteristics of veteran workers in mastering knowledge are determined by the special ways they master knowledge. At the same time, it also determines that their further study of scientific and cultural knowledge needs to start from practice and then improve and systematize and theorize.
	When conducting the above investigation, we also emphasized the need to see the political characteristics of veteran workers. After discussion, everyone realized that our teaching object—veteran workers—are members and backbones of the Chinese working class who shoulder the important task of building socialism at high speed. This characteristic determines that they have a clear purpose in learning, sufficient energy, great perseverance, and, like in production, can maximize their subjective initiative, overcome all difficulties, and move forward at high speed. With such superior political conditions and a wealth of production experience as a foundation, veteran workers will inevitably be able to improve at high speed. Veteran workers who currently only have a higher elementary school level do not need more than ten years, but only three or four years to improve to the level of university graduates. This is the conclusion we reached after the investigation.

	Conducting Typical Experiments of Teaching Reform

	The experiment of teaching reform was carried out in two stages: The first stage was to conduct trial teaching one-on-one with Zhu Yonghe, a seventh-grade electrician who graduated from higher elementary school, with Zhao Muliang, a full-time teacher who graduated from university. In the second stage, a veteran worker class was opened in the factory's spare-time university, absorbing nineteen (later developed to forty-eight) turners to participate, and Zhao Muliang was still the teacher to continue the experiment. The experiment in this class has been going on for ten months.
	The plan to trial teach Zhu Yonghe was formulated according to his production needs. At that time, what bothered him the most was that he "could do it but couldn't calculate it," and most of the calculation problems he raised involved trigonometry. Therefore, it was decided to start learning trigonometry. However, because the old framework in the mind of the teacher Zhao Muliang, who was in charge of the trial teaching, had not been broken, he took a detour in the teaching method when he began to trial teach. Zhao Muliang believed that trigonometry could be learned, but it had to be learned from the beginning, and some algebra geometry had to be learned first, otherwise it would be impossible to teach trigonometry. Under the guidance of this idea, he taught Zhu Yonghe algebra and gradually talked about the basic concepts of trigonometry. After about two weeks, Zhu Yonghe didn't want to learn anymore. He said to Zhao Muliang, "I don't understand what you are talking about, and after talking about trigonometry for a few days, it hasn't solved my production problems. My anxiety is still there, how can I learn it?" Zhao Muliang suspected, "Is it because Zhu Yonghe's culture is too low and he can't learn trigonometry?" The principal helped him analyze the reasons and pointed out that the reason for his poor teaching effect was that the teaching method was old-fashioned. He should change the abstract teaching method of talking about theory in isolation from production and from concept to concept. Instead, he should start from solving production problems, thereby leading to and explaining relevant scientific and cultural knowledge, and then reverse it to guide production. In this way, workers will definitely be able to understand and learn. Inspired by the facts, Zhao Muliang changed the teaching method. For example, Zhu Yonghe said that he couldn't calculate the length of the wires (that is, the wires on both sides of the electric pole) when erecting electric poles. In the past, one person would climb to the pole and one person would be below to measure with a rope, and then cut the wires according to the length of the rope. This time, Zhao Muliang taught him how to calculate the length of the wires. First, calculate the length of the wires, and then when you encounter trigonometric formulas, teach the formulas, and when you encounter theorems, teach the theorems, that is, first solve the production problem and then talk about the theory. Once the method changed, Zhu Yonghe's interest came, so he quickly learned this calculation method, as well as the trigonometric theorems, concepts, and operations derived from it. After Zhao Muliang found this teaching method suitable for the characteristics of veteran workers, he used this new teaching method to help Zhu Yonghe learn the relevant parts of algebra, geometry, trigonometry, physics, electrical engineering, and motor design in half a year (nine hours three times a week). Zhu Yonghe mastered this knowledge, and the calculation problems that could not be solved in the past can now be solved, and the books that could not be understood in the past can now be understood. At the same time, he can also change the number of motor phases and speed through his own calculations, and, with a little guidance, he can also design motors and power grids. Zhu Yonghe happily said, "The problems that have been stuck in my heart for more than ten years have now been solved. This time I can relax and do more for socialist construction."
	After the trial teaching, Zhu Yonghe transferred to the factory's technical secondary school class (equivalent to high school) to study, and also served as a part-time teacher in the apprentice technical secondary school class, teaching them electrical engineering. Zhu Yonghe has made a leap in improving his cultural and technical level in the past six months. This powerfully proves that as long as we implement the principle of "combining production and teaching students according to their aptitude" and carry out teaching reform in a practical way, we can achieve the goal of cultivating construction talents in a faster, better, and more economical way. At the same time, it also points out the specific way to quickly improve veteran workers, that is, to take learning with production tasks, teach what is needed, first make up for what is missing, and then improve.
	With the experience of the first stage of the experiment, when opening the veteran worker university class for the second stage of the experiment, we determined the schooling system, curriculum setting, and teaching plan based on the training objectives and the investigation of the knowledge level of veteran workers. The schooling system of this class is set at two and a half years (from higher elementary school level to university graduation), and the entire teaching is carried out in two stages according to the spirit of making up for what is missing and then improving. The main teaching task in the first stage is to "make up for what is missing." The method is to combine with production, attack calculations, and consciously teach them the relevant parts of high school algebra, trigonometry, as well as college courses such as tolerances, metal material science, advanced mathematics, physics, mechanical principles, and mechanical manufacturing in the process of solving the production problems raised by the students, so that they can design and manufacture general machine tools and components. The second stage is mainly to improve. The specific method is to take production as the key, take professional knowledge as the basis, and comprehensively utilize the knowledge of various scientific disciplines. Starting from the design of single-machine automation, we will study courses such as process design, engineering drawing, strength calculation, design calculation, and electrical engineering, so that they can reach the level of a considerable engineer who can independently design, skillfully master operating techniques, and organize and lead production. Among them, political classes account for one-sixth of the total class hours. The main study is Chairman Mao's works.
	The veteran worker university class has been in session for ten months, and the relevant parts of courses such as algebra, trigonometry, tolerances, and metal material science have been completed. Currently, in order to cooperate with the technical revolution movement centered on mechanization and automation, we are teaching the design of automated machine tools. Through this period of study, the common gains of these veteran workers are: they have initially solved the problem of "being able to do but not being able to calculate," they can read relevant technical books, and when solving production problems, their minds are broadened and they have more methods. Therefore, they have played a greater role in the technical revolution movement. Veteran workers Liu Futang and Liu Rongxing used the knowledge they learned to design and manufacture a scribing machine, which is not only more precise than manual scribing, but also improves efficiency tenfold. Veteran worker Su Shangyi also solved the key problem of a large number of product scraps due to errors in the design of silver contacts through learning.
	Through more than a year of practice in teaching reform, our main experience is: strengthening the Party's leadership and adhering to putting politics in command are the fundamental guarantees for thoroughly carrying out teaching reform. And taking Chairman Mao's "On Practice" as the theoretical basis for our teaching reform, so that every reform of teaching work conforms to the theoretical principles of "On Practice." At the same time, it is emphasized that teachers participating in labor and humbly learning from workers is also an important key to accelerating teaching reform.
	In the past year or so, the teaching reform in our factory has achieved some results due to the correct leadership of the Party and the active support of the masses. The achievement of these results is the victory of the Party's general line and education policy, and the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. In the future, we must further strengthen leadership and strengthen planning with the spirit of continuous revolution, learn from the experience of fraternal units, and carry out teaching reform more deeply, so that employee education can better meet the needs of the continuous leap forward in socialist construction. Now, all employees of our factory are fighting to complete the annual task half a year ahead of schedule. We will use the same soaring energy to complete the task of cultivating talents and ensure a double leap forward and double harvest in production and education.

    多快好省地培养建设人材
    国营天津电器厂代表　叶茂林
    一年多以来，我们工厂由于教学改革的深入开展，有力地促进了我厂职工教育的大发展，大提高。至1959年，我厂就建立了由六十八个班组成的从小学到大学的教育体系，职工入学率达98．2％，出席率稳定在90％以上。全厂职工的文化水平，以1960年同1958年相比，大学程度的已由3．15％提高到11．2％，中专和高中程度的由13．72％提高到49．7％，初中程度的则由42．09％降至20．4％，小学程度的也由39．79％降至19．89％，占职工数1．25％的文盲已于1960年4月全部扫除。全厂职工政治、文化、技术水平的迅速提高，已成为推动我厂生产持续大跃进的重要动力。我厂的总产值，如以1957年为一百，则1958年为三百六十三，1959年为四百九十八。1960年总产值计划比1959年又提高78％。
    一年多以来，在教学改革中，我们主要做了以下几件工作：
    揭发教学工作中的少、慢、差、费现象
    职工对教学工作的具体意见是：第一，学制年限太长。有的工人批评业余学校“只见开学典礼，不见毕业典礼”。第二，教学计划脱离生产，用的不学，学了没用。第三，教学方法脱离工人原有的基础，脱离生产实际。
    党委发动群众揭发了教学中的少、慢、差、费的现象以后，感到必须进行教学改革。同时，认为教学工作中的主要问题是一不结合生产，二不因材施教，只是脱离实际地照搬全日制学校的一套。而产生这些问题的根本原因则是党的教育方针没有得到贯彻，我们还没有从资产阶级教育思想的束缚下解放出来。因此，进行教学改革，必须深入开展两条道路、两种思想的斗争，进行兴无灭资的思想革命。
    坚持政治挂帅，加强政治思想工作
    教学改革问题的提出，在教学人员中引起了较大的思想波动。在教学改革初期，思想斗争最为激烈，有的人说“领导不了教育工作，不懂业务”。认为原有的一套就很好，而且是经过几百年实践才形成的，改了就要破坏科学系统性。也有的人不同意将生产中的计算问题作为讲数学的例题。提到加速培养人材，有的说“学习只能按部就班，没有什么窍门可找”，“快了，就不能保证质量”等等一些错误论点。这时，党委在政治思想工作方面采取的措施，除了密切注意思想动向，及时分析研究外，主要是组织学习和劳动锻炼。
    首先是组织全体教学工作人员反复地学习党的教育方针，号召大家敞开思想，大争大辩。领导上则以党的总路线和教育方针为标尺，深入发动群众，树立和发扬正确认识，批判和克服错误认识，对资产阶级观点一一作了分析批判，使全体教学工作人员的觉悟程度大为提高。同时，由于没有实践，有些人还有不少顾虑。究竟怎样改呢？怎样结合生产？我们不懂生产怎么办？教员们又提出了一系列的新问题。为了解决这些问题，我们就组织教学人员下车间参加劳动，在劳动中进一步改造思想，提高他们进行教学改革的自觉性和积极性。
    下车间参加劳动，对于知识分子出身的教师是一个新的课题，这里也有一场思想斗争。这个斗争过程是批判和克服轻视劳动、轻视劳动人民的资产阶级思想的过程。教师们在劳动中既上了生产课，又上了政治课。他们对生产逐渐熟悉了，同时，看到工人干劲冲天，只是由于缺乏某些科学文化知识，限制了他们发挥更大的作用（就是因为不会计算，一肚子宝贝拿不出来）。因而，进一步承认了教学脱离生产的缺点和开展教学改革的必要性。更重要的是教师在劳动中深深感到，工人在实际生产知识方面比自己高明，开始改变了对工人的看法；开始意识到生产经验丰富的工人可以不按照原来的学制学习，而走另外一条捷径。这些都进一步为教学改革从思想上铺平了道路。
    加强调查研究，掌握工人特点，贯彻
      “结合生产，因材施教”的原则
    要改变教学工作脱离生产，脱离实际的现象，必须贯彻“结合生产，因材施教”的原则。但是，生产对教育工作的要求是什么？我们施教的对象是什么样的“材”？在教师里是心中无数的，需要进行调查研究。我们首先对四级以上老工人的情况作了调查。调查结果说明，老工人的实际知识水平，远远超过了他们的学历（一般只读过高小），在多年的生产实践中，他们已经摸索到并且实际运用了很多基础文化知识和高深的科学技术原理，这些知识实际上已涉及到初中、高中、大学的许多课程内容，在专业工艺知识方面，则已达到大学的水平。正因为他们掌握了这些知识，所以他们才能解决工艺问题，进行某些设计和简单的计算，不断革新技术。他们所缺少的只是理论知识和计算方法。总起来看，老工人所掌握的知识有“一多一少”的特点。就是在专业知识方面，工艺知识多，理论计算少；在专业和文化基础知识方面，知道现象多，掌握原理少；在数学方面，是有几何，少三角，缺代数。老工人在掌握知识方面的这些特点，是由于他们掌握知识的特殊途径决定的。同时，它也决定了他们进一步学习科学文化知识需要从实践入手再提高，再系统化和理论化。
    在进行上述调查时，我们还强调了必须看到老工人政治上的特点。经过讨论，大家认识到，我们施教的对象——老工人，是肩负高速度建设社会主义重任的中国工人阶级的成员和骨干。这个特点决定了他们在学习上的目的性明确，干劲足，钻劲大，也像在生产上一样，能够最大限度地发挥主观能动性，排除万难，高速前进。有这样优越的政治条件，又有丰富的生产经验为基础，老工人必然能够高速度的提高，目前只有高小程度的老工人不需要十几年，只要三、四年就可以提高到大学毕业的水平。这就是我们进行调查后，得到的结论。
      进行教学改革的典型试验，
    教学改革的试验，分两个阶段进行：第一阶段，以高小毕业的七级电工朱永鹤为对象，配备一名大学毕业的专职教师赵慕梁，一对一地进行试教。第二阶段，在本厂业余大学中开设老工人班，吸收十九名（后发展为四十八人）车工参加，仍由赵慕梁担任教师，继续进行试验。现在这个班的试验已经进行了十个月。
    试教朱永鹤的计划，是根据他生产上的需要制订的。当时，他最感苦恼的是“会干不会算”，而他提出的计算问题，又以涉及三角的问题为最多，因此，确定从学三角开始。但是，由于担任试教的教师赵慕梁思想上的旧框框没有破，开始试教时，在教学方法上走了弯路。赵慕梁认为三角可以学，可是必须从头学起，而且还要先学一部分代数几何，不然没法讲三角。在这种思想指导下，他就教朱永鹤学代数，逐步讲到了三角的基本概念。讲了约两周，朱永鹤不愿意学了，他对赵慕梁说“你讲的我听不懂，而且讲了几天三角，也没有解决我生产上的问题，心病没有去，我怎么学得下去呢？”赵慕梁怀疑“是不是朱永鹤文化太低，学不了三角？”校长帮助他分析了原因，指出他教学效果不好的原因，关键问题在于教学方法老一套，应该把那种脱离生产、从概念到概念的抽象讲理论的方法，改为从解决生产问题入手，从而引出并讲解有关的科学文化知识，然后再反转来用于指导生产，这样，工人一定能听懂，一定能学会。赵慕梁在事实的启示下，改变了教学方法，如朱永鹤提出他在立电线杆时不会算丝线（即电杆两旁的铁丝）的长度。过去总是一个人爬到杆子上，一个人在下面，用绳子测量，然后根据绳子长短下线。这次，赵慕梁就给他讲计算丝线长度的方法，先把丝线的长算出来，然后遇到三角公式，讲公式，遇到定理讲定理，即先解决生产问题，后讲理论。方法一改变，朱永鹤的兴趣就来了，从而他就很快地学会了这个计算方法，以及由此引出的三角定理、概念和运算方法。赵慕梁在找到了这个适合老工人特点的教学方法后，他就用这种新的教学方法，在半年的时间里（每周三次九小时），帮助朱永鹤学了代数、几何、三角、物理、电工学、电机设计等课程的有关部分。朱永鹤掌握了这些知识，过去解决不了的计算的问题，现在能解决了，过去看不懂的书籍，现在能看懂了。同时，他也能通过自己的计算改变电机相数和转速，而且，在稍加辅导的情况下，还能进行电机和输电网的设计。朱永鹤高兴的说“憋在心里十几年的问题现在解决了，这回可轻松愉快了，可以为社会主义建设做更多的事了”。
    试教结束后，朱永鹤转入本厂中技班（相当高中）学习，并且担任了徒工中技班的兼职教师，给他们讲电工学。朱永鹤在这半年里，在提高文化、技术水平方面实现了一个飞跃。这就有力地证明了，只要贯彻“结合生产，因材施教”的原则，切实地进行教学改革，就可以达到多、快、好、省地培养建设人材的目的。同时，它也指出了迅速提高老工人的具体途径，就是以生产任务带学习，需要什么教什么，先补缺，后提高。
    有了第一阶段试验的经验，在开办老工人大学班进行第二阶段试验时，我们根据培养目标和对老工人知识水平的调查，确定了学制、课程设置和教学计划。这个班的学制定为两年半（由高小程度到大学毕业），整个教学按照先补缺后提高的精神，分为两段进行。第一段主要的教学任务是“补缺”。方法是结合生产，突击计算，在解决学员提出的生产问题的过程中，有意识地把他们所缺的高中代数、三角以及公差、金属材料学、高等数学、物理、机械原理和机械制造等大学课程的有关部分传授给他们，使他们能够设计和制造一般机床和部件。第二段主要是提高。具体办法是以生产为纲，以专业带基础，综合利用各门科学知识，从单机自动化设计开始，学习工艺设计、工程制图、强度计算、设计计算、电工学等课程。使他们达到能够独立进行设计、熟练掌握操作技术和组织领导生产的相当工程师的水平。其中，政治课占总学时的六分之一。主要学习毛主席著作。
    老工人大学班上课已经十个月，代数、三角、公差、金属材料学等课程的有关部分已经讲完。目前，为了配合以机械化、自动化为中心的技术革命运动，正在讲自动化机床设计。通过这一段学习，这些老工人的共同收获是：初步解决了“会干不会算”的问题，能够阅读有关的技术书籍了，解决生产问题时，脑子开阔了，办法多了。因而，他们在技术革命运动中发挥了更大的作用。老工人刘福堂、刘荣兴，运用学到的知识，设计并制造了一台划线机，不仅比手工划线精确，而且提高效率十倍。老工人苏尚义，通过学习也解决了某些产品因银接点设计有错误而大量报废的关键问题。
    通过一年多教学改革的实践，我们的主要体会就是：加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，是彻底进行教学改革的根本保证。并以毛主席的“实践论”作为我们进行教学改革的理论基础，使教学工作的每一项改革都符合“实践论”的理论原则。同时强调教师参加劳动，虚心向工人学习也是加速教学改革的一个重要关键。
    一年多来，我厂的教学改革，由于党的正确领导和群众的积极支持，已经取得了一些成绩。这些成绩的取得是党的总路线和教育方针的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利。今后我们要本着不断革命精神，进一步加强领导，加强计划性，学习兄弟单位的经验，更加深入地开展教学改革，使职工教育更加适应社会主义建设持续大跃进的需要。现在，我厂全体职工正在为提前半年完成全年任务而奋战，我们将用同样的冲天干劲，来完成培养人材的任务，保证生产、教育双跃进、双丰收。
