Developing Liming Amateur Agricultural University
Representative of Liming Amateur Agricultural University, Dongsheng People's Commune, Yanji County, Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, Jilin Province: Jin Shilong

Our Liming Amateur Agricultural University of Dongsheng People's Commune, Yanji County, Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, Jilin Province, was established on May 1, 1958, during the Great Leap Forward. Over the past two years, under the leadership of the Party, this school has been increasingly consolidated, grown, and strengthened, demonstrating a strong vitality. The development and consolidation of this school fully illustrates that the Party's policy of "walking on two legs" in running schools is completely correct. The farmers call their university the "cradle of new-type farmers."

Water Flows, a Channel is Formed

Before liberation, the farmers here suffered the cruel exploitation and oppression of Japanese imperialism and feudal forces, living a miserable life of being poorly clothed and fed half the year with chaff and vegetables. They were also severely devastated culturally; the Korean nationality did not have the freedom to learn their own language and writing, let alone the development of education. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, with the development of production and the improvement of the people's material lives, literacy and spare-time education have also flourished. By the end of 1957, illiteracy had been eliminated among 95% of young and middle-aged farmers. Currently, there are 1,289 students in senior elementary classes, 1,043 students in junior high classes, 172 students in senior high classes, 74 students in spare-time universities, and 157 students in various spare-time technical schools, totaling 2,735 students, accounting for 91.2% of the total number of young and middle-aged people, forming an interwoven educational system.

With the development of production, the masses' demands for learning culture, science, and technology have become increasingly higher, and the scope of management has become wider. Livestock farms and poultry farms have been established one after another, horse-drawn farm implements have gradually increased, and tractors have also arrived. New technologies in agricultural production have been proposed one after another. For example, "Atomic No. 2" rice is a late-maturing, high-yielding variety. When applying fertilizer to the seeds, phosphorus and potassium fertilizers are needed. Due to a lack of understanding of fertilizer effects, excessive nitrogen fertilizer was applied, resulting in lodging for four consecutive years. The ducks in the duck farm did not receive potassium feed during the egg-laying period, and they plucked each other's feathers, resulting in many deaths. Especially since the Great Leap Forward in production in 1958, the old production targets have been continuously broken, and new and higher production targets have been proposed. It is necessary to build water conservancy projects, open power plants, apply fertilizer rationally, engage in deep plowing on a large scale, comprehensively implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, and accelerate the speed of agricultural mechanization on the basis of the existing four tractors. The masses felt that ordinary spare-time education could no longer meet the higher requirements of production, culture, and technology, and proposed to establish higher-level spare-time schools. Therefore, running spare-time agricultural universities in rural areas became a natural and inevitable situation.

Growing in Struggle

The broad masses of working people, especially young farmers with a senior high school education, actively advocated that several cooperatives should jointly run a spare-time agricultural university. They said, "We can unite to build large-scale water conservancy projects and open power plants. Why can't we unite to run a university?" But some individuals said, "There are no professors, no school buildings, no teaching materials, and no equipment in the countryside. The cultural level of farmers is low, and they are unsophisticated. It is impossible to run a university at all." Some old intellectuals said, "Since ancient times, universities have been run in cities. It is a daydream for country bumpkins to run a university." Based on these ideological situations, the township Party committee launched a debate among cadres and the masses centered on "Is it necessary and possible to run a university in the countryside?" The view that a university could not be run was resolutely refuted by the masses. The township Party committee firmly supported the masses' demand for running a school, affirming that with the rapid development of production, it was necessary and possible to run a university in the countryside. Thus, this farmers' spare-time university was born.

When the red sun of the People's Commune rose on the Chinese horizon, its brilliance shone in all directions. Everything was refreshed, and everything was thriving. Under its brilliant illumination, this newborn seedling—the spare-time agricultural university—grew vigorously. The establishment of the People's Commune opened up broad avenues for running spare-time education on a large scale. At that time, the problems of the spare-time university, such as the scattered residences of students, the contradiction between production and learning time, and the lack of a production base, were all smoothly resolved.

After the university had been running for a period, some people came out again and pointed fingers, saying that it was "famous but empty, and the students it taught were not useful." These people were the kind who "would not turn back until they hit the south wall." In order to clarify whether the students were "useful" or not, at the end of August 1959, according to the actual progress of the spare-time university, using the same examination questions for the first-year students of full-time agricultural colleges and the same grading standards, three courses were tested. The results showed that among the 16 undergraduate students who took the exam, 9 scored 5 points and 7 scored 4 points in Fruit and Vegetable Science; 7 scored 5 points and 9 scored 4 points in Crop Cultivation; 11 scored 5 points, 3 scored 4 points, and 2 scored 3 points in Botany. Among the 26 preparatory students who took the test, 10 scored 5 points, 7 scored 4 points, and 7 scored 3 points in Meteorology; 11 scored 5 points, 10 scored 4 points, and 5 scored 3 points in Plant Physiology; 4 scored 5 points, 9 scored 4 points, 10 scored 3 points, and 3 scored 2 points in Mathematics. The test results showed that although the spare-time university had less learning time than the agricultural college, the results were not bad, especially in the Crop Cultivation course, where the results were slightly higher than those of the agricultural college. This test silenced those who said that the students were "not useful."

A Pearl on the Banks of the Hailan River

"The spare-time agricultural university is the hope of the farmers. It is more precious than a pearl salvaged from the Hailan River!" This is the common language of our Dongsheng people. Here, how deep trust and expectation are placed, and how proud and honored the farmers feel for their university. The whole society supports it wholeheartedly. When there were no school buildings, the commune members contributed labor and materials to build them themselves. When poor peasant Jin Heji heard that there was no wood for building the school, he sent the twenty pieces of lumber he had prepared for building his own house. Through the labor of the students and commune members, the school buildings were built. It only cost two yuan to start the university. Now it has 40,000 yuan worth of property and equipment, including six microscopes, more than 1,000 experimental instruments, and more than 40,000 books.

Production Team, School, Research Institute

After the establishment of the People's Commune, it allocated seven hectares of paddy fields, eleven hectares of dry land, two hectares of orchards, six pigs, seven cattle, and two carts to the spare-time university, and regarded the school as a directly affiliated production team of the commune. This not only provided the students with a base for production and scientific research, but also concentrated the students scattered in various places, making it easier to study. They are both students and farmers, both mental laborers and manual laborers.

The learning content of the spare-time university is determined according to the production needs of the commune, achieving the combination of politics, culture, and technology. The political course focuses on Chairman Mao's works, and currently, they are studying "On Contradiction" and "On Practice." The Party's various policies and guidelines are also an important part of the political course. The basic courses mainly include mathematics, physics, chemistry, and botany. The technical courses include twelve types, such as soil, agricultural machinery, horticulture, and animal husbandry, according to production needs. In addition, there are six hours of Chinese language classes every week.

In the arrangement of production and learning time, the principles of "learn more during slack periods, learn less during busy periods, learn flexibly during the busiest periods, and strive not to stop" and the spirit of ensuring that both production and learning are not neglected are implemented. In addition to completing the production tasks of fixed land, they also undertake the production tasks uniformly assigned by the commune. During the tense stages of spring plowing, summer weeding, and autumn harvest, the method of combining classroom and field learning is adopted, with four to five hours of study per week. In winter, they generally study for twelve hours. The second-year students have studied for a total of 823 hours.

From the beginning of its establishment, the university has resolutely implemented the policy of combining education with productive labor, adhering to the principle of linking theory with practice and learning for application. The students all have a senior high school education and have undergone four to ten years of labor training or grass-roots work experience. Among them, production team leaders and cadres above the management area accountant account for 38% of the existing 74 students. More than 30% of the students have participated in various agricultural scientific research groups in agricultural production, which provides favorable conditions for linking theory with practice and learning and applying simultaneously. The book knowledge learned in the classroom is closely linked with production practice. When encountering difficult problems in production, they are brought back to the classroom for research. Classroom teaching is combined with on-site teaching, physical dissection, experiments, observation, and visits. When studying the sowing amount of rice and the function of plant roots, under the guidance of teachers, outlines are drawn up, and students are organized to debate. Finally, the teacher summarizes and draws conclusions. Some classrooms also adopt the method of introducing typical experiences, which has a very good effect because the students have practical knowledge in this regard. In March last year, students from the third grade of Changchun Agricultural College and the fourth grade of Yanbian Agricultural College came to our commune to conduct a soil survey, and students from Liming Spare-time Agricultural University also participated. Although their knowledge of soil was much less than that of the two regular university students, they were familiar with the local situation and had practical knowledge. After they studied with the experienced farmers, they were able to distinguish the nature of the soil, which played a significant role in the soil survey and was praised by the teachers and students of the two agricultural colleges.

In production, the students made glass warm bed seedling cultivation, transplanted rice seedlings twenty days in advance, implemented single-row and single-irrigation, increased water temperature, prevented rice blast, carried out rational fertilization, and used the "two, two, six" close planting method. Therefore, their crops are the best in the whole commune, yielding an average of 4,000 jin more per hectare than the whole commune. The commune members constantly asked their university students to introduce their high-yield experiences.

In order to adapt to the needs of commune production development, the spare-time university has formed six scientific research groups: crop, plant protection, soil and agricultural chemistry, horticulture, agricultural machinery, and surveying. During the deep plowing of land and water conservancy construction in the winter of 1958, they used the chemical knowledge they had learned to create 500 jin of indigenous explosives. Last year, during the preparation for plowing, they researched and manufactured 35 kinds of indigenous pesticides based on the common diseases and insect pests of various local crops. Student Hong Chengyi used cattail, tomatoes, tobacco, wolfsbane, quicklime, sulfur, mountain apricot kernels, etc. to trial-produce more than 20 kinds of indigenous pesticides. The various scientific research groups of the spare-time university have established regular contact with the more than 30 technical research groups in the spare-time schools of various management areas. They used on-site meetings, wired broadcasts, and other forms to publicize technical issues such as rice seedling cultivation, field management, rational fertilization, and prevention of diseases and insect pests to the masses, enabling the commune to achieve an unprecedented bumper harvest. They also planted 150 ping of rice fine variety experimental fields, experimented with twelve rice varieties, and set up a rice water demand measurement station, preparing to solve the problem of measuring the water demand per mu per plant of rice within two years. According to Michurin's theory that grafting temperate apples can improve cold resistance and improve varieties, they used wild grapes and domestic grapes from within the Pass to solve the problem that domestic grapes could not survive the winter here due to the cold weather. They and the old farmers jointly experimented to solve the question that the scientific community here had been debating for a long time—whether rice is better planted in north-south rows or east-west rows. It was proposed that rice planted in north-south rows can receive full sunshine, the water temperature is higher than that of east-west rows, and it can also prevent lodging. The hybridization experiment of sorghum and rice has been successful, and the second generation can be cultivated next year. At the same time, they also wrote more than 130 scientific papers. For example, student Bai Funv's article "Grass and Wood Ash Should Not Be Mixed with Human Manure" put forward some very convincing insights. The students also jointly compiled the book "Folk Pesticide Production Methods" based on the experience of the old farmers. Student Lü Genze's book "Questions and Answers on Rice Cultivation Techniques" has been published by the Yanbian Science and Technology Association and is welcomed by the masses. Student Jin Bingqian researched and trial-produced an animal-powered rice thresher, which increased efficiency by one time. Then, he researched and developed a hydraulic rice thresher, which increased efficiency by four times.

In the past two years, the students have also created many folk songs, essays, songs, scripts, and other literary works, and published more than 100 articles in magazines such as "Yanbian Literature," "Hailan River," "Changbai Mountain," and the Yanbian Daily.

Reaching a New Level

The growth and strengthening of Liming Spare-time Agricultural University proves the victory of the Party's education policy. At present, our school is still in the spirit of continuous revolution and reaching a new level. According to the requirements of the new situation, new stage, and new tasks of high-speed production development and comprehensive technological transformation, and according to the labor force situation of the commune, it is planned to gradually transform from a spare-time to a part-work, part-study university. It is planned to develop into five departments this year on the basis of the spare-time university. The tractor station will run the agricultural machinery department, the 10,000-pig farm will run the animal husbandry department, the orchard will run the horticulture department, the hydroelectric station will run the electrical engineering department, and the existing production base of the spare-time university will run the agricultural department. In this way, the students are both production personnel, students, and scientific researchers. The number of students will also increase to 114, and it is planned to increase to 208 by 1962. By 1963, higher education can be popularized throughout the commune. This development plan will create conditions for eliminating the difference between mental and manual labor in rural areas. Every commune member will become a new type of farmer with socialist and communist consciousness and a high level of scientific and cultural knowledge. This is no longer a distant ideal, but something that is about to be realized.

    发展中的黎明业余农业大学
    吉林省延边朝鲜族自治州延吉县东盛人民公社黎明业余农业大学代表　金时龙
    我们吉林省延边朝鲜族自治州延吉县东盛人民公社的黎明业余农业大学是在大跃进的1958年5月1日成立的。两年来，在党的领导下，这个学校日益巩固、成长、壮大，显示了强大的生命力。这所学校的发展和巩固，充分说明了党的办学的两条腿走路的方针是完全正确的。农民把自己的这所大学称之为“新型农民的摇篮”。
    水到渠成
    解放前，这里的农民饱受日本帝国主义和封建势力的残酷剥削和压迫，过着衣不遮体、糠菜半年粮的悲惨生活。在文化上更受到严重的摧残，朝鲜民族没有学习自己语言文字的自由，更谈不到教育事业的发展。解放后，在党的领导下，随着生产的发展和人民物质生活的提高，扫盲和业余教育也得到了蓬勃发展，到1957年末，在95％的青壮年农民中扫除了文盲。现在高小班学员一千二百八十九人，初中班学员一千零四十三人，高中班一百七十二人，业余大学七十四人，各类业余技术学校学员一百五十七人，共有学员二千七百三十五人，占青壮年总数91．2％，形成了一个纵横交错的教育体系。
    随着生产的发展，群众对学习文化科学技术的要求越来越高，经营范围越来越广，畜牧场、家禽场陆续兴办，马拉农具逐渐增多，拖拉机也来了；农业生产上新的技术一个个提了出来。例如“原子二号”水稻是个晚熟产量高的品种，度籽粒时需要上磷钾肥料，因不懂肥效，过多地上了氮肥，结果一连四年贪青倒伏；养鸭场的鸭子到产卵时得不到钾质饲料，互相钳毛，死了很多。特别是1958年生产大跃进以来，旧的生产指标不断被突破，新的、更高的生产指标提出来了。要兴修水利，开办发电厂，合理施肥，大搞深耕，全面贯彻农业“八字宪法”，在已有四台拖拉机的基础上加快农业机械化的速度。群众感到普通的业余教育已经不能满足生产和文化技术的更高要求，提出来要办更高一级的业余学校。因此，在农村中举办业余农业大学，便成为水到渠成势在必办的局面了。
          在斗争中成长
    广大劳动群众主张，特别是具有高中文化程度的青年农民更积极主张几个社联合起来办业余农业大学。他们说：“大搞水利，开办发电厂能联合起来干，办大学为什么不能联合起来办呢？”但也有个别人说：“农村没教授，没校舍，没教材，没设备，农民文化水平低，土气大，根本不能办大学。”有的旧知识分子说：“自古以来，大学都是城里办的，乡下佬办大学，真是“痴蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉。”乡党委根据这些思想情况，在干部和群众中，以“农村需不需要办大学？能不能办大学？”为中心展开了辩论，认为不能办大学的说法，受到了群众的坚决驳斥。乡党委坚决支持了群众办学的要求。肯定了生产的迅速发展，在农村办大学是必要的和可能的。于是，这所农民业余大学出世了。
    当中国地平线上，升起了人民公社这颗红太阳，它的光芒普照四方，真是万象更新，一切欣欣向荣。在它的光辉照耀下，这颗新生的幼苗——业余农业大学，茁壮地成长起来了。人民公社的建立，为大办业余教育开辟了广阔的道路。当时业余大学存在的学生居住分散，生产和学习时间矛盾以及缺乏生产基地等问题，都顺利地解决了。
    大学办了一个阶段之后，又有些人出来指手划脚地说它是：“名声好、里头空，教出的学生不顶用。”这些人，他们是“不碰南墙不回头的”。为了弄清学生究竟“顶不顶用”，在1959年8月末，按着业余大学的实际进度，用全日制农学院一年级同科考试题目，统一评卷标准，测验了三门课程，结果本科参加考试的十六个人中，果树蔬菜学得五分的九人，四分的七人；作物栽培学得五分的七人，四分的九人；植物学得五分的十一人，四分的三人，三分的二人。预科参加测验的二十六人中，气象学得五分的十人，四分、三分的各七人；植物生理学得五分的十一人，四分的十人，三分的五人；数学得五分的四人，四分的九人，三分的十人，二分的三人。测验结果表明：业余大学虽然比农学院学习时间少，但成绩并不差，特别是作物栽培课，成绩还略高于农学院。这次测验，使那些说，“不顶用”的人哑口无言了。
          海兰江畔一颗珍珠
    “业余农业大学是农民的希望，要比从海兰江里涝出来的珍珠还要贵重！”这是我们东盛人民共同的语言。这里寄与多么深切的信任和期望，农民为他们的大学感到怎样的骄傲和自豪。社会全力支持它，没有校舍，社员就献工献料自己动手盖，贫农金河吉听说修校舍没有木料，就把自己准备盖房子用的二十根木方子送来。经过学生和社员的劳动，校舍修成了。只花了两元钱就把大学办起来。现在已有四万元的财产和设备。有显微镜六台，实验仪器一千多件，图书四万多册。
        生产队、学校、研究所
    人民公社成立后，拨给业余大学七公顷水田，十一公顷旱田，两公顷果园，六口猪，七头耕牛，两辆车，并把学校当成公社的一个直属生产队。这不仅使学生有了生产和科学研究的基地，而且使分散在各地的学生集中起来，便于学习。既是学生又是农民。既是脑力劳动者，又是体力劳动者。
    业余大学的学习内容，是根据公社的生产需要确定的。作到政治、文化、技术三结合。政治课是以毛主席著作为中心，目前正在学习“矛盾论”、“实践论”，党的各项方针、政策也是政治课的一个重要内容；基础课以数学、物理、化学、植物学为主；技术课根据生产需要，设有土壤、农业机械、园艺、畜牧等十二种。另外每周还有六小时的汉语课。
    在生产和学习的时间安排上，贯彻了“平时多学，忙时少学，大忙机动学，力争不停”的原则和保证生产学习两不误的精神。除了完成固定土地的生产任务外，还负担公社统一分配的生产任务。春耕、夏锄、秋收的紧张阶段，用课堂和地头学习相结合的方法，每周学习四五小时；冬季一般学习十二小时。二年级的学生共学习了八百二十三小时。
    从建校起就坚决贯彻了教育和生产劳动相结合的方针，坚持了理论联系实际，学以致用的原则。学生都是具有高中文化程度，并经过四年到十年的劳动锻炼或经过基层工作锻炼的青年农民和农村骨干。其中生产队长，管理区会计以上的干部占现有七十四名学员的38％。并有30％以上的学员在农业生产中参加过各种农业科学研究小组，这就为在学习中理论联系实际，边学边用提供了有利条件。课堂上学到的书本知识和生产实践紧密的联系起来，在生产中碰到疑难问题，再提到课堂上来研究。课堂教学与现场教学，实物解剖、实验、观察、参观等相结合。在学习水稻的播种量和植物根的作用时，在教师主持下，列出提纲，组织学员辩论，最后由教师归纳得出结论。有的课堂还采取了典型经验介绍的办法。因为学员有这方面的实践知识，效果很好。去年3月，长春农学院三年级，延边农学院四年级的学生，到我们公社进行土壤普查，黎明业余大学的学生也参加了。虽然他们的土壤知识比两个正规大学生少的多，但是他们熟悉本地情况，有实践知识。经过他们和老农一研究就分清土壤性质了，对土壤普查起了很大作用，受到两个农学院师生的称赞。
    在生产上学生们做了玻璃温床育苗，提前二十天插秧，实行了单排单灌，提高了水温，防止了稻热病，进行了合理施肥，运用了“二、二、六”密植法。因此，他们的庄稼是我们全社最好的，比全社每公顷平均产量多打四千斤。社员不断要他们大学生介绍丰产经验。
    业余大学为了适应公社生产发展需要，组成了农作物、植物保护，土壤与农业化学、园艺、农业机械、测量等六个科学研究小组。1958年冬季深翻土地和水利建设时，用学过的化学知识创造了五百斤土炸药；去年备耕时，根据当地各种农作物常发生的病虫害，研究和制造了三十五种土农药。学员洪成一用香浦、西红柿、烟草、狼毒、生石灰、硫磺、山杏仁等试制成了二十多种土农药。业余大学的各种科学研究小组和各管理区业余学校里的三十多个技术研究小组建立了经常联系。利用现场会议，有线广播等形式，向群众宣传了水稻育苗、田间管理、合理施肥、防止病虫害等技术问题。使公社获得了空前大丰收。他们还种了一百五十坪水稻优良品种试验田，试验了十二种水稻品种，搞了一个水稻需水测量站，准备在两年内，解决水稻每垧每株需水量的测定工作。根据米丘林的寒带苹果接枝后能提高抗寒力和改进品种的学说，用野生葡萄和关内的家葡萄接枝的办法，解决了这里因天气寒冷家葡萄不能过冬的问题。他们与老农共同试验解决了这里科学界争论很久的——水稻南北行栽好还是东西行栽好的问题。提出了南北行栽，水稻能全面得到日照，水温比东西行的高，还能防止倒伏。高粱和水稻的杂交试验已经成功，明年就可以培育出第二代。同时他们还写出一百三十多篇科学论文。例如：学员白福女写的“草木灰与人粪尿不应混合”一文，提出了一些很有说服力的见解，学员们还根据老农的经验，共同编写了“民间农药制作法”一书，学员吕根泽写的“水稻栽培技术问答”一书，已由延边科学技术协会出版，受到群众的欢迎。学员金炳千，研究试制成一台畜力打稻机，提高效率一倍。接着又研究出水力打稻机，提高效率四倍。
    两年来学员们还创作了很多民歌、散文、歌曲、剧本等文艺作品。在“延边文学”、“海兰江”、“长白山”等杂志和延边日报上发表了一百多篇。
            更上一层楼
    黎明业余农业大学的成长壮大，证明了党的教育方针的胜利。目前我们学校还以不断革命，更上一层楼的精神，根据生产高速度发展和全面进行技术改造的新形势、新阶段、新任务的要求，按照公社劳动力情况，计划由业余逐步转向半工半读性质的大学。计划今年在业余大学的基础上，发展成五个系，以拖拉机站办农业机械系，以万头猪场办畜牧系，以果园办园艺系，以水电站办电机系，以业余大学现有的生产基地办农业系。这样，学员既是生产人员又是学生，又是科学研究员。学生的人数，也将增加到一百一十四名，计划到1962年发展到二百零八名，到1963年就可以在全公社范围内普及高等教育了。这个发展规划，将为农村消灭脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别创造条件。社员个个成为有社会主义、共产主义觉悟的，有高度科学文化水平的新型农民。这已不是遥远的理想，而是快要实现的事情了。
