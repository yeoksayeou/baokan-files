    Congo
    June 30th marks the day the Congolese people gained independence from Belgium's eighty years of colonial rule.
    Congo is located in the center of the African continent, bisected by the equator. Its area is 2,343,000 square kilometers, approximately 77 times the size of Belgium, and its population is over 13 million.
    Known as the "Jewel of Central Africa," Congo possesses abundant resources. Its production of radium, uranium, cobalt, and diamonds ranks first in the capitalist world. Among these, uranium reserves account for 40% to 80% of the capitalist world's total, and production accounts for about 90% of the capitalist world's total.
    Congo's rich resources have long attracted the covetous eyes of Western colonial powers. In 1884-1885, at the Berlin Conference, where European colonial powers divided up colonial spoils, Congo became the private property of the Belgian King. In 1908, Congo was transformed into a Belgian colony. The Congolese colonial government possessed unlimited despotic power, politically depriving the Congolese of all political rights. The colonial authorities established nineteen detention camps throughout Congo to imprison Congolese patriots and those deemed to have "evil thoughts." Economically, the monopoly companies enjoyed staggering profits, more than double the profit rate in Belgium itself. According to official Belgian statistics from 1957, of Congo's total national income of 59.5 billion Belgian francs, the 100,000 Europeans, less than 1% of the total population, received 46%, while the 13 million Congolese received only 54%. That is to say, the income of Europeans was sixty-three times that of the Congolese.
    After World War II, American imperialism made a large-scale incursion, viewing Congo as a vast "raw material warehouse" and an important base for military expansion. The United States plundered 90% of Congo's uranium production. The United States also colluded with the Belgian authorities to draft a so-called "Congo Economic Development" plan, providing loans to Belgium in an attempt to further control Congo's economy.
    Under the plunder and aggression of the colonialists, the Congolese people have continuously and wave after wave launched anti-colonial struggles that have spread throughout the country. On January 4, 1959, the African people of Leopoldville took the lead in launching a massive struggle, which formed an unprecedented mass movement on a national scale. In January-July alone, more than thirty mass demonstrations, parades, strikes, and protest rallies involving more than 10,000 people broke out in various parts of Congo. The Belgian government finally had to agree to grant it independence on June 30th of this year, which is the result of the Congolese people's long-term, repeated, tortuous, and heroic struggle.

    刚果
    6月30日，是刚果人民摆脱比利时八十年之久的殖民统治取得独立的日子。
    刚果位于非洲大陆的中部，赤道横贯其境。它的面积达二百三十四万三千多平方公里，约等于比利时七十七倍，人口有一千三百多万。
    号称“中非的宝石”的刚果，拥有丰富的资源。镭、铀、钴和金刚石产量都占资本主义世界第一位。其中，铀的蕴藏量占到资本主义世界的40％到80％，产量占资本主义世界的90％左右。
    拥有丰富资源的刚果，早就引起了西方殖民主义国家的垂涎。1884—1885年，在欧洲殖民国家进
  行殖民地分赃的柏林会议上，刚果成为比王私人采地。1908年，刚果被变成了比利时的殖民地。刚果殖民政府，拥有无限的专横权力，在政治上剥夺刚果一切政治权力，殖民当局在全刚果设立了十九个拘留营来囚禁刚果的爱国志士和所谓“中了恶念的人”。在经济上，垄断公司的利润惊人，比比利时本土利润率高出一倍多。据1957年比官方统计，全部刚果的五百九十五亿比法郎的国民收入中，不到总人口1％的十万欧洲人的收入占了46％，而一千三百余万刚果人的收入只占54％，就是说欧洲人为刚果人的收入的六十三倍。
    第二次世界大战后，美帝国主义大举侵入，把刚果看作是一个巨大的“原料仓库”和军事扩张重要基地。美国掠夺刚果铀产量达90％。美国还勾结比利时当局草拟了所谓“开发刚果经济”的计划，给予比利时贷款，企图进一步控制刚果的经济。
    在殖民者掠夺和侵略下，刚果人民一直连绵不断地、此起彼伏地对殖民者展开了反殖民主义的斗争蔓延全国，1959年1月4日，利奥波德维尔的非洲人民首先揭开了声势浩大的斗争，这个斗争形成了全国规模空前的群众性运动。仅在1月—7月，刚果各地爆发万人以上的群众性示威、游行、罢工、抗议集会等，就达三十余起。比利时政府最后不得不同意它在今年6月30日实现独立，这是刚果人民长期以来进行反复曲折的英勇斗争的结果。（新华社）（附图片）
