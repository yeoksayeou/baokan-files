    The People Who Defend the Harvest
    By our reporters Zhai Qiyin, Wang Chang, and Qiao Yingheng
    The heavy ears of wheat on both banks of the Bailong River and Baishui River have begun to turn yellow, rustling in the wind. The vast wheat sea brings the people of the Longnan mountainous area joy on the eve of the harvest. People are joyfully engaged in the final, intense battle to defend the harvest.

    Under the leadership of the Party, the Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, old farmers, technicians, women, and children of the Si Ji Qing Production Team of the Chengguan People's Commune in Wen County, Gansu, are all consciously taking action to defend the fruits of the harvest. The surging tide of people is even more heroic, enthusiastic, and magnificent than the Baishui River rushing beside them... Natural disasters no longer seem so terrifying in their presence.

    The Joy of the Blind
    The joy of the harvest envelops the entire village and also infects the blind man, Yuan Guoan. Every day, when he walks past the wheat fields with his cane, he always stops to touch the large, full ears of wheat when he hears the "rustling" sound. The events of more than twenty years ago then climb into his mind. That year, he suffered a serious illness, and the puppet Baozhang took the opportunity to seize his only piece of land. His eyes were blinded in that tragic era.

    After liberation, his life got better and better. Now that the crops are growing so well again, Yuan Guoan can't suppress the joy in his heart. These days, he is busier than ever, just like a healthy person, helping the feeders sift grass and helping the canteen. He has only one wish: to free up more time for others to defend the harvest. When people are still asleep, he gets up, puts on his clothes. Relying on his familiarity with every ridge and every door, he wakes up the cooks first to prepare the meals early. Before the dawn of the East has even appeared, the blind man's whistle sounds. This is the signal for a day of battle, and the peaceful earth suddenly boils.

    The Night of Wind and Rain
    One evening, the wind brought a humid smell that was biting. In the middle of the night, the wind blew harder and harder, a sign that a rainstorm was coming.

    Han Jiuying was coaxing her child, lying in bed, tossing and turning unable to sleep. The shadow of last year's hailstorm, which left the team's rice ears bare, struck her heart. At two o'clock, the night grew darker and the rain grew heavier. Han Jiuying could no longer contain her anxiety, pushed aside the child next to her, and ran outside without even putting on her clothes properly. Outside was a large, dark expanse, so dark she couldn't see her fingers, only the sound of rustling wheat ears churning on the earth. A terrible thought occupied her mind: "If the wheat falls, it'll all be chaff!" No, she must not let a single stalk of wheat fall! She rushed out into the wind and rain.

    Technician Lao Zhang's house was blown open. Han Jiuying didn't say a word, picked up an electric baton, turned around, and ran outside. She followed the ditch and the field ridges along the river, holding a flashlight, checking field by field. She stopped in front of a wheat field; a small patch of wheat stalks had been blown down. At this time, a group of women, following the light, also ran over noisily, and they quickly tied up the fallen wheat.

    The rain poured down. Jiuying persuaded everyone to go home and rest, but insisted on staying to guard the wheat. The women, seeing this, refused to go back. The rain streamed down their hair and soaked their clothes, but they still struggled forward through the ankle-deep mud. In this dark night filled with wind and rain, only Jiuying and her comrades' bright eyes shone like stars.

    Treat the Wheat Like It Knows Warmth and Cold
    Xiao Taoshou is an expert in wheat and rice cultivation. He has been farming for decades and has never cultivated wheat as good as this year's, so he is particularly fond of it. He tends to it during the day and cares for it at night, truly treating it like it knows warmth and cold. When the leaves of Bima No. 1 turned yellow and developed rust disease, Xiao Taoshou carried a basket on his back to find wild flower roots and cattails and other medicinal materials, boiled them into water, and taught everyone how to prevent and control the disease. When the wind picked up at night, he would worry so much that he couldn't sleep all night. Before dawn, he rushed ahead of everyone else and plunged into the dense wheat fields to bind the stalks. At this time, the dew was heavy, and older people were prone to catching colds, so others didn't let him go in. He said, "A grain of wheat, a drop of sweat, if you're late to support it, it will be like a bruise on a person's body, and it will be difficult to recover!"

    When encountering critical moments, this quick-witted old man always offers unique insights to help everyone untangle the knots in their hearts. A few days ago, Secretary Xiao Shuchang was considering applying the final topdressing of flowering and grain-filling fertilizer to the wheat. At that time, it was the busy season for rice seedling cultivation. If only the wheat fields in the river valley areas were topdressed, the labor force could barely manage, but if the high-mountain wheat fields were to be topdressed, the transportation labor force could not be spared. Xiao Taoshou, knowing this, ran to offer a rational suggestion: keep more of the manure fertilizer in the river valley, as it would not be difficult to transport; save the chemical fertilizer for sending up the mountains, as it would not require much labor. "Applying chemical fertilizer requires a lot of watering, where will you get so much water in the high mountains?" a young man reminded him in a sarcastic tone. In fact, Xiao Taoshou had already discussed it with the meteorologist beforehand and predicted that it would rain in the next two days, so he chewed on his dry tobacco pipe and slowly lit it before confidently answering, "There will be rain, applying chemical fertilizer will surely work."

    Clever Girls' "Water Gun" Shows its Power
    In the Si Ji Qing Production Team's wheat high-yield area professional team, there are twenty or so "clever girls" who are almost identical in appearance. In terms of age, they are all between eighteen and twenty-four years old; in terms of skill, they are dexterous; in terms of energy, they are all full of vigor. Each of them is like a rising sun, full of vitality. The first person to discover rust disease was the clever girl Zhang Qingxiang. With a worried heart, she ran into the command post in one breath. At this time, the cadres, technicians, and old farmers of the command post were also studying the problem of rust disease prevention and control, and based on the spirit of "treat one plant when you find it, treat one area when you find it, and treat a large area when you find an area," they decided to immediately carry out large-scale prevention and control work to completely eradicate rust disease. However, the team's existing sprayers were not enough, and time did not allow for delay, so the cadres of the command post, seeing Zhang Qingxiang burst in, assigned this task to her.

    Zhang Qingxiang quickly turned around to find Han Jiuying, Li Qiulian, and the other clever girls to discuss. Look at the girls' enthusiasm, with each of them chipping in ideas, and a solution was quickly found. They decided to use the "water guns" that children play with to replace the sprayers. Everyone immediately set about cutting bamboo and borrowing tools. The careful clever girls quickly made several "water guns" that day, filled them with homemade pesticides, and used different spraying methods to experiment in a small wheat field. They would wait until the next day to observe the actual effects of various spraying methods in order to determine large-scale promotion. This experiment proved that the advantages of "water gun" spraying are: it shoots far, spreads evenly, costs little money, and has a strong killing power.

    That night, using three bamboo poles, by the dim light, they sawed, shaved, and drilled holes. Everyone crowded into the room, talking and laughing, singing non-stop, and they worked until late at night to make more than sixty "water guns." The next morning, everyone mobilized and, in one breath, sprayed sixty-three mu of wheat fields, controlling the spread of rust disease.

    The Far-Sighted Commander
    The command post of the Si Ji Qing Production Team's wheat high-yield area is located in a small house north of the Party branch's command field. Every night, when the commune members are already asleep, the command post is still lit by a kerosene lamp. The commanders, led by branch secretary Xiao Shuchang, fight alongside the commune members during the day to defend the harvest; at this time, they meet again to discuss the next day's battle deployment.

    Xiao Shuchang is still a young man of twenty-four years old. He farmed with his father as a child and has rich knowledge of production. In addition, he is good at using the mass line working method, which keeps the team's production organized. He runs around the mountains all day, sometimes directing "battles," sometimes convening meetings, and sometimes asking the meteorologist about weather changes. It seems that he has inexhaustible energy.

    The reporter met Xiao Shuchang in the command post. He talked about the lessons learned from some failures in previous years and the harvest experience of this year, from the upcoming summer harvest to striving for a comprehensive harvest this year... From his conversation, it can be understood that his thinking has already considered the next season's rice production and the preparation for next year's production. In fact, they have already selected and reserved seeds for next year's wheat sowing, and based on the different characteristics of several varieties and the team's different natural conditions, they have determined the distribution plan for next year's wheat production step by step. He said: "Production should be done sooner rather than later. Sowing wheat ahead of schedule last winter laid a good foundation for early rice transplanting this year. To be honest, early is early in everything. The arrangement of various production activities this year is more handy than in previous years. Undoubtedly, if we take one step firmly this year, we will follow up step by step next year!" His strong confidence and strength, and his far-sighted thinking in production, left a deep impression on the reporter.

    保卫丰收的人们
    本报记者　翟其寅　王昌　乔应衡
    白龙江和白水江两岸沉甸甸的麦穗开始黄熟，随风发出“沙沙”声响。波涛万顷的麦海给陇南山区的人们带来了丰收前夕的喜悦。人们在欢乐中卷入最后一场紧张的保卫丰收的战斗。
    甘肃文县城关人民公社四季青生产队的共产党员、共青团员、老农、技术员、妇女和儿童，在党的领导下，都自觉地行动起来保卫丰收的果实。汹涌湃澎的人流，比起奔腾在他们身边的白水江，更加豪迈、热烈、宏伟……，自然灾害在他们面前已经显得并不是可怕的了。
    盲人的喜悦
    丰收的喜悦笼罩着全村，也感染了盲人袁国安。他每天扶着拐杖路过麦地的时候，听到“沙沙”的声响总要停下来抚摸一阵这穗大粒饱的麦子。二十多年前的往事这时就爬上他的心头。那年他患了一场大病，伪保长乘机夺走了他仅有的一块土地，他的双眼就是在那个悲惨的年代急瞎了。
    解放后他的日子愈过愈好了。如今庄稼又长得这般好，袁国安真是压抑不住内心的喜悦。这些天来，他就像健康人一样，忙得格外起劲了，一会帮饲养员筛草，一会帮食堂做事。他只有一个愿望：让别人多腾些功夫保卫丰收。当人们还在熟睡的时候，他就披衣起床了。凭着自己摸熟了的每一道坎，每一扇门，先叫醒炊事员，提早烧饭。东方的曙光尚未露头，盲人的哨音便吹响了。这是一天战斗的信号，平静的大地顿时沸腾起来。
    风雨之夜
    一天晚上，风里带点潮湿味扑鼻而来。半夜，风吹得一阵紧似一阵，这是将有一场暴雨的征兆。
    韩九英哄着孩子，躺在床上，翻来复去睡不着。去年一场冰雹把全队稻穗打得精光的阴影撞击着她的心。两点钟了，夜更深，雨更急。韩九英再也按捺不住不安的心情，推开身边的孩子，顾不得披好衣服便往外跑。外面黑黝黝的一大片，伸手不见五指，只听得沙沙的麦穗声在大地上翻腾，一个可怕的念头占据了她的心：“麦倒一把糠哟！”不，决不能让一株麦倒伏！她便迎着风雨冲了出来。
    技术员老张的房屋被撞开了，韩九英二话没说，拿起一根电棒，转身往外跑。她顺着水渠和河边的田埂，捏着手电，一块块地检查。在一块麦田前面她停住了，有一小片麦秆被风吹倒了。这时，一群妇女迎着这边的亮光，也都吵吵嚷嚷跑来了，七手八脚地把倒了的麦子绑好了。
    雨水倾注而下，九英劝大家回家休息，自己却坚持要留下来守麦。妇女们看到这情景，也不肯回去，雨水顺着她们的头发往下淌，衣服淋湿了，但仍然在困难地踏着没脚深的泥泞前进。在这风雨弥漫的黑夜，只有九英和她的战友们的明眸像星星在闪光。
    待麦真是知暖知寒
    萧桃寿是一个务麦、务稻的能手。他种了几十年的庄稼，从来没有务过像今年这样好的小麦，所以他也特别疼爱它。白天侍候它，夜晚关心它，真是知暖知寒。碧玛一号的叶子萎黄了，生了锈病，萧桃寿便背上背斗，去找野花根和苍蒲等药材，煮成水教给大家防治。夜里起了风，他就会急得整夜睡不着觉。天色未明，他一脚抢在大伙前面，一头钻进密密层层的麦地去绑扎。这时露水大，年纪大的人容易受凉，别人不让他进去，他说：“一粒麦，一滴汗，扶迟了，会像人身上有伤的地方淤了血，就难复原了！”
    遇上紧要关口，这个心眼明快的老人，总是拿出独到的见解帮助大家解开心头的疙瘩。前些天，萧树昌书记在考虑给小麦追施最后一次扬花灌浆肥的问题。当时因正赶上水稻育秧的大忙季节，如果单给川坝地区的麦田追肥，劳力还勉强可以应付，要给高山麦田追肥，运输劳力就抽不出来。萧桃寿知道这件事，便跑去提了一个合理化建议：把粪肥多留在川坝，送起来不吃力；省下化肥往山上送，花不了多少劳力。“施化肥要多浇水，高山上那来那么多水呀？”一个小伙子用抬杠的口气提醒他。其实萧桃寿事先已同气象员商量过了，预测近两天要下雨，因此他嚼着旱烟斗，不紧不慢地给烟斗点着火，才满有把握地回答：“有雨，上化肥准成。”
    巧姑娘“水枪”显神威
    四季青生产队的小麦丰产方的专业队里，有二十几个差不多是一般模样的“巧姑娘”。论年纪，都不过是十八岁至二十四岁；论本领，心灵手巧；论劲头，个个十足。她们一个个好似刚出山的太阳，生气蓬勃。第一个发现锈病的人，就是巧姑娘张青香。她怀着焦急的心情，一口气跑进指挥部。这时指挥部的干部、技术员、老农，也正在研究防治锈病的问题，并且根据“发现一株治一方，发现一方治大片”的精神，决定立即开展大面积防治工作，彻底扑灭锈病。可是，队里现存的喷雾器不够用，时间又不允许拖延，指挥部的干部见张青香撞进来，便把这个任务交给了她。
    张青香急忙转身去找韩九英、李秋莲一伙巧姑娘商量。你看姑娘们那个乐劲，你一言，我一语，办法很快想出来了。她们决定用孩子们玩的“水枪”来代替喷雾器。大伙随即分头动手砍竹子，借工具。细心的巧姑娘们当天赶做了几管“水枪”，汲上土农药，采用不同的喷射方法，在一小块麦田里先做试验，等第二天观察各种喷射方法的实际效果，好确定大面积推广。这次试验证明“水枪”喷射的优点是：射得远，晒得匀，花钱少，杀伤力强。
    这天夜里，她们用了三根竹竿，就着微微的灯光，锯的锯，削的削，钻眼的钻眼，大家挤在屋子里，有说有笑，歌声不断，直忙到深夜，赶制出六十多管“水枪”。翌晨，全体出动，一股作气，便喷洒了六十三亩麦地，控制了锈病的蔓延。
    高瞻远瞩的指挥员
    四季青生产队的小麦丰产方指挥部，就设在党支部指挥田的北面一间小屋子里。每天深夜，当社员已经熟睡的时候，指挥部里依然点着马灯。以支部书记萧树昌为首的指挥员们，白天同社员一道战斗，保卫丰收；此刻又会师一块，合计次日的战斗部署了。
    萧树昌还是一个二十四岁的青年人，他小时跟父亲务农，在生产上有丰富的知识，加上他善于运用群众路线的工作方法，把全队的生产搞的井井有条。他成天山上山下地奔波忙碌，一会指挥“战斗”，一会召集会议，一会又找气象员询问气象的变化，好像在他身上蕴藏着用不尽的精力。
    记者在指挥部里见到了萧树昌，他从往年的一些失败教训谈到今年的丰收经验，从将要到来的夏收谈到争取今年全面丰收……。从他的谈话里，可以了解到他的思想已经考虑到下一季的水稻生产和明年的生产准备工作。事实上，他们已经给明年播种小麦选留好种子，并且根据几个品种不同特性和本队不同的自然条件，分步确定了明年小麦生产分布计划。他说：“生产宜早不宜迟，去冬把小麦播种抢前了一步，就给今年水稻早插秧打好了基础。说实在，一早百早，今年各项生产活动的安排比往年都要得心应手，无疑地，今年一步踏上了，明年也会步步跟上！”他那强烈的信心和力量，他那在生产上高瞻远瞩的思想，给记者留下了深刻的印象。
