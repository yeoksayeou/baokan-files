    Smooth Loading and Unloading, More, Faster, Better, and More Economical
    Results of Implementation in Beijing Stations, Loading and Unloading Efficiency Universally Improved
    (Our Newspaper) Beijing railway departments are vigorously promoting a mass movement for the smooth loading and unloading of goods. They are using various smooth equipment and tools to load and unload goods, increasing loading and unloading efficiency by one to thirty times, with the highest reaching several hundred times, greatly shortening loading and unloading operation time. This loading and unloading method accelerates the turnaround of vehicles.
    Smooth loading and unloading is based on the principle of "water flowing downhill," allowing goods to automatically slide down from a high place along smooth tools using their own weight. It is more effective than using machinery to lift the goods up and then lower them. This loading and unloading method was developed on the basis of the advanced experience of high platforms and low cargo positions created in 1958. In the past month or so, the staff of various freight stations in the Beijing railway department have been engaged in a technical innovation movement to vigorously promote smooth operations, and have successfully created more than a dozen types of smooth equipment and tools such as sliding frames, chutes, sliding boards, sloping warehouses, and automatic opening and closing doors for open-top cars. They are not only suitable for loading and unloading bulk goods such as coal and sand, but also can load and unload various long, bulky, and packaged goods that are not afraid of falling. When loading, the train is driven under the high platform, and the goods are slid from a high place into the carriages. When unloading, the loading and unloading workers only need to put the smooth tool on the carriage, creating a 40-degree slope, and the goods can automatically slide down the slope slowly. In the past, when loading five-meter-long round steel at Xibianmen Station, two workers were required to carry it, walk across a narrow scaffolding board, and load the goods from bottom to top. It took twelve workers two hundred and forty minutes to load each freight car. After implementing mechanized loading and unloading, they switched to using cranes to lift bundles into the carriages, requiring only two workers ninety minutes per freight car. Recently, they built a sloping platform, and two workers put the round steel on the slope. In a short while, the round steel automatically slid into the carriages, and each freight car was loaded in less than a minute. Employees at Guang'anmen Station created a "three-section sliding ladder" that can be lengthened or shortened according to the distance of the cargo position. This sliding ladder can slide any packaged goods within fifty kilograms, except for explosive and liquid goods, and the efficiency is doubled compared to mechanical loading and unloading.
    Using smooth methods to load and unload goods can also allow the entire train to be loaded and unloaded simultaneously, creating favorable conditions for fast loading and unloading. For example, on the one-stop transportation line from the Mentougou coal mine to the coal yard, loading and unloading workers use high-platform coal storage bins to load coal. Once the discharge outlet of the coal storage bin is opened, the entire train can be filled in just a few minutes. The train uses wind power to automatically open the doors. When it is pulled to the destination, the coal automatically flows from the bottom of the carriage into the low cargo positions on both sides by pressing the wind valve. This greatly accelerates the turnover of vehicles and materials, reducing the time to unload a train of goods from one hour to ten minutes.
    Smooth equipment and tools have nine major advantages: simple structure, easy to move, easy to obtain materials, quick to repair and build, low cost, no power required, convenient operation, significant efficiency, guaranteed safety, and large, medium, and small stations can build them in large quantities according to local conditions.

### 滑溜装卸  多快好省  北京各车站推行结果，装卸效率普遍提高

    滑溜装卸  多快好省
    北京各车站推行结果，装卸效率普遍提高
    本报讯　北京铁路部门大搞装卸滑溜化的群众运动，采用各种滑溜设备和工具装卸货物，使装卸效率提高一倍到三十倍，最高达到几百倍，大大缩短了装卸作业时间。这种装卸方法，加快了车辆周转速度。
    滑溜化装卸，是根据“水往低处流”的原理，使货物借本身的重量，自动由高处沿着滑溜工具滑下来。它比用机械把货物吊上去再放下来，更加事半功倍。这种装卸方法，是在1958年创造的高站台、低货位的先进经验基础上发展起来的。一个多月来，北京铁路部门各个货运车站的职工，在大搞滑溜化的技术革新运动，已经创造成功滑架、滑梯、滑板、滑坡仓、敞车自动开关门等十几种滑溜设备和工具。它们不仅适合装卸煤、砂石等散装货物，而且可以装卸各种不怕摔的长大、笨重和包装货物。在装货时，列车开到高站台底下从高处把货物溜到车厢里面，卸车时，装卸工人只要把滑溜工具搭在车厢上，成为四十度的斜坡，货物就能自动沿着斜坡缓缓滑下。西便门车站过去在装五米长的圆钢时，需要两个工人扛着，走过狭长的脚手板，由下往上装货。每装一辆货车，需要十二名工人装二百四十分钟。实行装卸机械化后，他们改用起重机一捆一捆地往车厢内吊装，每辆货车只要两个工人装九十分钟。最近，他们修成一座滑坡站台，由两名工人把圆钢放在滑坡上，一会儿功夫，圆钢就自动滑到车厢内，每辆货车不到一分钟就装完了。广安门车站职工创造一种可以根据货位远近伸长或缩短的“三节式滑梯”。这种滑梯除爆炸货物和液体货物不能滑溜外，凡是在五十公斤以内的包装货物都能滑溜，效率比机械装卸提高一倍。
    利用滑溜的办法装卸货物，还能使整个列车同时装卸，替快装快卸创造了良好的条件。例如，从门头沟煤矿通往煤场的一条龙运输线上，装卸工人采用高站台储煤仓装煤，一打开储煤仓的溜口，整列车只要几分钟就能装满。列车是利用风力自动开门的，拉到目的地一按风阀，煤就从车厢底部自动流到两旁的低货位。这样就大大加速了车辆和物资的周转，卸一列火车货物的时间从一小时缩短到十分钟。
    滑溜化的设备和工具，具有九大优点：结构简单，移动轻便，取材容易，修造迅速，成本低廉，不要动力，操作方便，效率显著，确保安全，大、中、小车站都能因地制宜大批建造。（附图片）
