Xinhua News Agency, June 23rd dispatch from Port Elizabeth: Recently, the flames of resistance against the cruel rule of the South African authorities have ignited in the Transkei and Pondoland African "Reserves" in the eastern Cape Province of the Union of South Africa.

It is revealed that recently, in the Transkei area, which has two million Africans, from the Kei River in the Cape Province to Natal, the light of burning thatched houses illuminates everywhere at night. They vehemently oppose the South African authorities' implementation of the so-called "land rehabilitation plan" in these "Reserves," driving large numbers of scattered Africans out of their homes and concentrating them in designated areas for settlement, and they oppose the South African authorities' appointment of a large number of puppet chiefs to control, exploit, and harm the Africans.

In the Pondoland area, despite the South African authorities' sending troops, police, and aircraft on June 2nd to carry out a bloody suppression of the resisting Africans, and establishing a police rule there, the local Africans are still persisting in the struggle in the mountains. Angry Africans continue to punish those puppet chiefs.

The Johannesburg "Golden City Post" reported that Africans often hold meetings on a mountain ten miles southeast of Pondoland. Tribal people from the plantations there said, "They will persist, and the police will never be able to catch them."

It is reported that hundreds of Africans in this area once fought back with guns against the suppression of a large number of armed police.

    坚决反抗当局的残酷统治
    南非非洲人上山坚持斗争
    新华社23日讯　伊丽莎白港消息：在南非联邦开普州东部的特兰斯克和庞多兰非洲人“保留地”，最近燃起了反抗南非当局残酷统治的烽火。
    据透露，最近以来，在拥有二百万非洲人的特兰斯克地区，从开普州的凯河到纳塔尔，每到夜间，到处都被焚烧着的草屋的火光所照亮。他们剧烈反对南非当局在这些“保留地”实行所谓“土地复兴计划”，把大批散居的非洲人赶出他们的家园而集中到指定的地方集居，反对南非当局任命了大批傀儡酋长来控制、剥削和残害非洲人。
    在庞多兰地区，尽管南非当局6月2日派军警和飞机对反抗的非洲人进行血腥镇压，并在那里建立了警察统治，但是当地的非洲人仍在山中坚持斗争。愤怒的非洲人不断惩罚那些傀儡酋长。
    约翰内斯堡的“金城邮报”报道说，非洲人在庞多兰东南十英里的一座山上经常开会。那里的种植园的部族人说，“他们将坚持下去，警察永远也没办法抓到他们”。
    据报道，这个地区的数百名非洲人曾经开枪反击大批武装警察的镇压。
