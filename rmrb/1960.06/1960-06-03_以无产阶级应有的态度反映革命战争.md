Reflecting the Revolutionary War with the Attitude Expected of the Proletariat
	Yang Hansheng

After watching the films "Kim Ok-hee" and "Youth in the Flames of War," my overall impression is very good, and I am very excited. I believe that the primary measure of their success is to see what position and viewpoint the authors use to treat the revolutionary war: Is the revolutionary war destroying our personal happiness and bringing us suffering? Or will it ultimately bring us happiness and complete liberation? I think these two films are very correct in their treatment of this issue, and it is something we should be happy about. These two films have some common characteristics: that is, they sing the praises of revolutionary optimism, a high degree of self-sacrifice, and the spirit of class friendship. They never give people another impression: that war is always war, that war brings us suffering, brings us sorrow, brings us heavy misfortune, thus making people feel confused, bleak, pessimistic, and disappointed. Instead, they use the greatest perseverance to persevere in the national revolutionary war and the war of liberation. In any difficult environment, they optimistically believe that we will surely defeat the enemy and eliminate the enemy, and that we will surely achieve the final victory. The protagonists of "Kim Ok-hee" and "Youth in the Flames of War" and the revolutionary soldiers in the troops are full of this spirit. This is the greatest success of these two films.

We Chinese people love peace and oppose war, but when the enemy imposes war on our heads, forcing us to take up arms and wage a just war, the Chinese people are very resolute, brave, and full of confidence in victory. This is reflected very clearly and strongly in our classical literature and art. When depicting a just war, our classical literature and art never emphasize or exaggerate its cruelty and horror to shake our fighting will. For example, the Yang family generals, in their war against aggression, although their environment was so difficult, and the internal and external enemies they encountered were so sinister, they were always full of touching heroism. Even if only some widows and orphans were left after the battle, they were still full of confidence and took up arms to fight the enemy to the end. Our two films are also full of this spirit, which gives us a deep impression. Therefore, I think that the attitude of these two films towards the issue of war is the attitude that the proletariat should have, and it is completely correct. This is the first point I want to make.

Second, these two films have achievements in terms of script, direction, and performance. The screenwriters of the two plays wrote these two different war themes according to the spirit I just mentioned, and they wrote them relatively well. Wang Jia-yi, the director of "Kim Ok-hee," has the courage and is good at grasping some exciting scenes and focusing on depicting them. The director of "Youth in the Flames of War" is also very good, and the film is handled smoothly, concisely, and clearly, without wasting any words. The actors are also very good. For example, Bai Yang has been working in the film industry for a long time and has had certain achievements in the past, but today, under the care and leadership of the Party, her artistic life is still developing and becoming more and more mature. In the film "Kim Ok-hee," her performance is very successful. For example, after Kim Ok-hee's lover is sacrificed, her comrades resolutely advocate to retrieve his body. In order to avoid greater sacrifices, Kim Ok-hee suppresses her emotions in grief and prevents them from doing so with a decisive action; after severely scolding Xiao Li-zi, she gives him motherly, kind comfort; and finally, when she reunites with Xiao Li-zi, the political commissar, and her old comrades after enduring thousands of hardships, her feelings are mixed and her joy is infinite. Bai Yang's performance in these places has depth and is very touching. I am also very happy after watching the young actors. Gao Shan in "Youth in the Flames of War" is a modern Mulan in our War of Liberation. She is a girl who concealed her gender and threw herself into the revolutionary army with deep-seated hatred. In terms of her inner self, the environment she is in and the problems she encounters in the struggle are not simple. In terms of her appearance, she cannot be very much like a woman, nor can she be completely like a man, let alone like a weirdo who is neither male nor female. Although this is a role that actors like to play, it is also a role that actors cannot easily play well. If this role is played too much or not enough, it will immediately fail and there is danger. Wang Suya, who plays Gao Shan, has performed very well and appropriately, and in many places, she can perform appropriately with respect to changes and development of the character’s thinking and feelings. This is too difficult. Therefore, I believe that the creation of the character Gao Shan is successful.

Third, I would also like to talk about my views on some issues in these two films.

In terms of shortcomings, I think that the scene in the cave in "Kim Ok-hee" was not handled well by the screenwriter and director, so it was difficult for the actors to perform it well. I think that in that kind of situation, a person like Kim Ok-hee who has been trained and tested for a long time would not shout like that: "Help!" I think it would be best to have a silent scene at this time, and then let her slowly recall and look at the surrounding environment. Based on her combat experience and life knowledge, she might be able to estimate that someone saved her. It might be better to handle it this way. The way it is handled now shows some unnecessary emotional sentiments to a certain extent. Later, the mountains and rivers, I don’t understand what kind of atmosphere that is setting off? This is a small shortcoming, it can only be regarded as a small flaw.

Now let's talk about "Youth in the Flames of War." I heard from comrades that some people have some opinions about this film. To sum up, there are probably three points: one is the issue of love, the second is the issue of Gao Shan's personal prominence, and the third is the issue of the handling of the platoon leader.

Let's talk about the issue of love first. I think the love shown in this film is healthy. The protagonists in the film were not talking about love from the beginning. The theme of this film is not about writing about love. Because the play is almost over, the platoon leader still doesn't know that Gao Shan is a woman, so how can they fall in love? It only wrote such an inevitable result: that is, this pair of young comrades-in-arms developed from combat friendship to mutual admiration. I think this stroke is still well written, don't avoid it. If it is love built on the foundation of combat friendship and class friendship, why can't it be written? This is a very natural combination. So I think this love is healthy. Of course, I also think that some puns are unnecessary, and they sound harsh and uncomfortable.

Regarding the issue of Gao Shan's personal prominence, I don't think Gao Shan is personally prominent. The problem is that the author did not clearly write about the process of Gao Shan being politically and ideologically more mature than the platoon leader. The author only explained that the heroine has been a party member for three years and was a district team leader, which is not enough. This does not explain why she is so politically mature so early and can embody the spirit of the Party so well right away, and be more enlightened than the platoon leader. In fact, when she criticized the platoon leader's shortcomings, she said that this was told to her by the Party branch, not her personal opinion, that is to say, she has the leadership of the Party behind her. I think Gao Shan had already grasped the situation of this platoon before she came to this platoon. Her company commander must have told her and must have given her a task, asking her to help the platoon leader more. It would be great if this could be added, instead of just talking about it. I think, suppose that in the scene where she fights with the platoon leader, the platoon leader looks down on her and doesn't take her opinions seriously, and she feels very difficult, and at this time, she recalls how the instructor explained to her when she first came, if this point is added and this scene appears, then Gao Shan's criticism of the platoon leader is well-founded and has a source, then what is the problem of personal prominence?

In addition, there is the issue of the handling of the platoon leader. Some comrades say that it seems that the author appreciates individual heroism to some extent. However, I think the criticism of individual heroism in this play is still relatively profound. Where is the problem? The platoon leader is not completely an individual hero, he has good qualities, and he is not a negative character. His individual heroism should be severely criticized, but this person has many advantages, he is brave, decisive, firm, fearless, loyal to the Party, loves comrades, and has a spirit of self-sacrifice. Therefore, this person also has a good side, and it is the main side. Therefore, this character is not a very easy character to create. On the one hand, you have to get rid of his individual heroism, and on the other hand, you have to affirm the good things in his character. If he is described as unlovable, it will be a failure—of course, if you don’t criticize him, you are wrong. I think this kind of handling is still possible, criticizing his wrong side and affirming his lovely and good side. After all, he is a class warrior!

    以无产阶级应有的态度反映革命战争
    阳翰笙
    《金玉姬》和《战火中的青春》这两部片子我看了之后，总的印象都很好，非常兴奋。我认为衡量它们的成功与否，首先要看作者用什么样的立场、观点来对待革命战争：革命战争是破坏我们个人幸福，给我们带来了苦难呢？还是终于会给我们带来了幸福，带来了彻底解放？我觉得这两部片子在对待这个问题上都是非常正确的，是值得我们高兴的。这两部影片有一些共同的特点：那就是歌颂革命的乐观主义，高度的自我牺牲精神和阶级友爱精神，绝没有给人另一种印象：战争总是战争，战争给我们带来了苦难，带来了忧伤，带来了重重的不幸，因而使人看后感到迷惑渺茫，悲观失望。而是用艰苦卓绝的最大的毅力，坚持民族革命战争，坚持解放战争。在任何艰险的环境中，都很乐观地相信我们一定能战胜敌人消灭敌人，一定能够取得最后的胜利。“金玉姬”和《战火中的青春》的主人翁以及部队里的革命战士都充满了这种精神。这正是这两部影片最大的成功之处。
    我们中国人民是热爱和平反对战争的，但是当敌人把战争强加在我们的头上，迫使着我们不得不拿起武器来，进行正义战争的时候，中国人民是很坚决英勇，充满必胜的信心的。这在我国的古典文学艺术里就有着很鲜明强烈的反映，我国的古典文艺在描绘正义战争的时候，向来不强调和渲染它的残酷性、恐怖性来摇撼自己的战斗意志。比如杨家将，在他们进行反对侵略的战争中，虽然他们的环境是那么艰苦，碰着的内外敌人是那样的险恶，但他们却始终充满着感人的英雄气概，最后那怕战死下来只有一些寡妇孤儿，她们却还是信心百倍地拿起武器来同敌人战斗到底。我们这两部影片也都充满了这种精神，这点给我们的印象很深。因此我觉得这两部影片在对待战争问题的态度上，是无产阶级应有的立场，是完全正确的，这是我要说的第一点。
    第二，这两部影片在编、导、演方面都有成就。两个戏的编剧是根据了我刚才所说的精神来写这两个不同的战争题材的，而且写的比较好。《金玉姬》的导演王家乙同志有魄力，善于抓着一些动人心弦的场面，集中地加以描写。《战火中的青春》的导演也很好，影片处理得流畅，精练，简单明了，不多费笔墨。演员也很好，比如白杨同志，她从事电影工作时间比较长，过去已有一定的成就，但今天在党的关怀和领导下，她的艺术生命还正在发展，愈来愈走向成熟。在《金玉姬》这部影片里，她是演得很成功的，如金玉姬的爱人牺牲后，战友们坚决主张去把他的尸身抢回来，金玉姬为了避免更大的牺牲，在悲痛中压制着自己的感情，阻止他们这样做时那种当机立断；痛责小李子后而又像母亲样的给以慈祥的爱抚；以及最后当她经过千磨百难后同小李子、政委和老战友们重逢时的百感交集和无限的欢欣，这些地方白杨都演得有深度，很感动人。年轻的演员我看后也很高兴，《战火中的青春》中的高山，是我们解放战争中的现代花木兰，她是一个隐瞒着自己的性别怀着血海深仇投身到革命军队中来的一个少女，就她的内心来说，她所处的环境，她在斗争中碰到的问题，都很不简单，就她的外形来说，她既不能很像一个女人，也不能完全像一个男人，更不能像一个不男不女的怪人，这虽是一个演员们喜欢演的角色，却也是演员们不易演好的角色，这个角色演的过火了或者演的不够都不行，都有立即遭到失败的危险，扮演高山的王苏娅同志却演得很有分寸，对于这个人物的思想感情的变化和发展，很多地方都能演得恰如其分，这就太不容易了，因此我认为高山这个人物的创造是成功的。
    第三，我还想就这两部影片中的一些问题，谈谈我的看法。
    在缺点方面，我认为《金玉姬》山洞里那场戏编导都没处理好，因此演员演起来也很困难。我想在那种情景之下，像金玉姬这样一个久经锻炼和考验的人，不会那样喊：“来人啊！”我想这个时候最好是静场，然后让她慢慢地回想一下，看看周围的环境，以她的战斗的经验和生活知识来说，她有可能会估计到是有人救了她的，这样来处理也许会好一点，现在这样处理在某种程度上还表现了一些不必要的伤感情绪。后来接下去是山啊、水啊，我不懂那是烘托个什么气氛？这是个小缺点，只能算作小疵吧。
    现在谈谈《战火中的青春》。听同志们说，有人对这片子有些意见。归纳起来大概有三点：一是恋爱问题，二是高山个人突出的问题，三是对排长处理的问题。
    先谈谈恋爱问题。我觉得这部影片所表现的恋爱是健康的。影片中的主人翁并不是一开始就在那里谈恋爱。这个影片的主题也并不是写恋爱。因为戏都快完了，排长还不知道高山是女的，怎么恋爱得起来呢？它只写了这样一个必然的结果：就是这对青年战友，从战斗的友谊发展到了相互爱慕。我觉得这一笔写的还是好的，不要避讳。如果是建筑在战斗的友谊和阶级的友谊之上的恋爱，为什么不可以写？这是很自然的结合。所以我觉得这恋爱是健康的。当然，有些双关语我也觉得没有必要，听起来反而刺耳、不舒服。
    关于高山个人突出的问题，我觉得高山没有个人突出，问题是作者没有把高山在政治上思想上比排长成熟的过程写清楚，作者只交代了女主人翁有三年党龄，当过区小队长这是不够的，这并不能说明她政治上为什么成熟得那么早，能一来就比排长高明，能那么好的体现党的精神。其实，她在批评排长缺点时，她就曾说这是党支部告诉她的，不是她个人的意见，也就是说她的背后是有党的领导的。我想高山在来这个排以前，对这个排的情况早就已经掌握了。她的连首长一定要交代她并一定会给她一个任务，叫她对排长得多加帮助的。这里要是别光凭嘴说能多加一笔就好了。我这样想，假设她跟排长斗争的那场戏，排长看不起她，不把她的意见当回事，她感到很困难，这时候她就回想起初来时指导员怎么交代她，如果加上这一点，出现一下这个场面，那高山之批评排长是有根有据有来源的，那还有什么个人突出的问题呢。
    另外，是排长这个人的处理问题，有同志说，好像作者对个人英雄主义有所欣赏。不过，我看这个戏对个人英雄主义的批判倒还是比较深刻的。问题在哪里呢？排长这个人物不完全是个个人英雄主义者，他有好的品德，不是个否定的人物。他的个人英雄主义应该受严厉的批判，但是这个人有很多好处，他英勇、果敢、坚定、无畏、忠于党、热爱同志、富有自我牺牲精神。所以，这个人也有好的一面，而且是主要的一面，因此这个人物是一个不大好创造的人物，一方面要整掉他的个人英雄主义，一方面又要肯定他在品质上的好的东西。如果把他形容的不可爱了，就失败了，——当然你不批评他，又错了。我觉得这样处理还是可以的，批判他错误的一面，肯定他可爱的好的一面，他毕竟是个阶级的勇士啊！
