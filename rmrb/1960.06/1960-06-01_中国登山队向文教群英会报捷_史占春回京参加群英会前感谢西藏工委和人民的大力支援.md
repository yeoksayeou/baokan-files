Xinhua News Agency, Mount Everest, May 31st: The Chinese Mountaineering Team sent a telegram today to the upcoming National Conference of Advanced Workers in Culture and Education, reporting their victory.

In the telegram, they said, "As we victoriously conquered the world's highest peak – Mount Everest – the heroes on the national cultural and educational front will also hold a conference in the capital, Beijing, which makes us extremely excited. The convening of the conference gives all mountaineering team members great encouragement and strengthens our confidence and strength to overcome difficulties."

"Now, with great excitement, we report to you: Under the kind leadership and care of the Party and the government, all the mountaineering team members have victoriously completed the task after two months of arduous struggle. At 4:20 AM Beijing time on May 25th, three young mountaineers successfully ascended its 8,882-meter summit from the north slope of Mount Everest for the first time in world mountaineering history."

The telegram stated, "All of us mountaineering team members deeply know that the victory of conquering Mount Everest should be attributed to the correct leadership of the Party and the support of the people of the whole country. Therefore, we must guard against arrogance and impetuosity, continue to work hard, plant the five-star red flag all over the peaks of the motherland, and contribute all our strength to the socialist construction of the motherland." The telegram concluded by saying, "We wish the conference success on the roof of the world and wish all the delegates good health."

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, May 31st: Shi Zhanchun, the captain of the Chinese Mountaineering Team, returned to Lhasa from the Chinese Mountaineering Team's base camp on the 30th. He will travel from here to Beijing to represent the Chinese Mountaineering Team at the upcoming National Conference of Advanced Units and Advanced Workers on the Cultural and Educational Front.

This leader and organizer of the Chinese Mountaineering Team, during the third acclimatization march to climb Mount Everest, along with athlete Wang Fengtong, climbed over huge rock slopes along a ridge less than one meter wide, reaching near the top of the famous "Second Step" on the north slope of Mount Everest at an altitude of 8,600 meters. Braving the severe cold of minus 40 degrees Celsius, he stayed in a snow cave overnight, and the next day reconnoitered a safe route for the mountaineering team's fourth march to attack the summit.

The marks left on Shi Zhanchun's face by the high-altitude wind, snow, and strong sunlight have not completely faded yet. Before leaving Tibet for the capital, he gave an energetic interview to Xinhua News Agency reporters. In his talk, Shi Zhanchun once again emphasized that the honor of the mountaineering team's ascent of Mount Everest should first be attributed to the Party and to the people of the whole country, because the mountaineering team has received the care of the Party and the people of the whole country from the first day of its formation.

Shi Zhanchun said that it should also be especially mentioned that the Tibet Work Committee of the Communist Party of China and the people of Tibet provided great help and support to the mountaineering team, which was an important guarantee for completing the task. He expressed his heartfelt thanks on behalf of all the mountaineering team members.

    新华社珠穆朗玛31日电　中国登山队今天打电报给即将在北京召开的全国文教先进工作者代表大会，报告他们胜利的消息。
    电报中说，当我们胜利地征服了世界最高峰——珠穆朗玛峰的时候，全国文教战线上的英雄们也将在祖国首都北京举行大会，这使我们异常振奋。大会的召开，给我们全体登山队员以极大的鼓舞，增强了战胜困难的信心和力量。
    现在，我们以万分兴奋的心情向你们报捷：在党和政府的亲切领导关怀下，全体登山队员经过了两个月的艰苦奋斗，已经胜利地完成了任务。5月25日北京时间四点二十分，三位年轻的登山队员在世界登山史上第一次成功地从珠穆朗玛峰的北坡，登上了它拔海八千八百八十二米的顶峰。
    电报中说，我们全体登山队员深深地知道，这次征服珠穆朗玛峰的胜利，应当归功于党的正确领导和全国人民的支援。因而，我们一定戒骄戒躁，继续努力，把五星红旗插遍祖国的高峰，为祖国的社会主义建设事业贡献出全部力量。电报最后说，我们在世界屋脊上预祝大会成功，并祝全体代表同志们身体健康。
    新华社拉萨31日电　中国登山队队长史占春30日从中国登山队大本营回到拉萨。他将从这里前往北京，代表中国登山队出席即将开幕的全国文教战线先进单位和先进工作者代表大会。
    这位中国登山队的领导者和组织者，在攀登珠穆朗玛峰的第三次适应性行军中，曾和运动健将王凤桐沿着不到一米宽的山脊，翻过巨大的岩坡，登上了珠穆朗玛峰北坡拔海八千六百米的著名“第二台阶”顶部附近的地方，并冒着摄氏零下四十度的严寒，在雪洞里住了一夜，第二天为登山队第四次行军突击顶峰侦察了一条安全的路线。
    目前高山风雪和强烈阳光留在史占春脸上的印记，还没有完全褪去。在他即将离开西藏前往首都以前，精神奕奕地向新华社记者发表了谈话。史占春在谈话中再次强调，登山队这次攀登珠穆朗玛峰的荣誉，首先应归功于党，归功于全国人民。因为登山队从组成的第一天起，就受到党和全国人民的关怀。
    史占春说，还应该特别提到的是，中共西藏工委和西藏人民给予了登山队的大力帮助和支援，这是完成任务的重要保证。他代表全体登山队员表示衷心的感谢。
