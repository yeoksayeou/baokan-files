    Five Days in the Countryside
    Wang Chuanfei, First Secretary of the Anren County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Hunan

    May 28th
    A ray of dawn pierced through the east window, drilling straight into the room. Today is another clear day. How much the current crops need such good weather!

    The statistics team sent a daily production progress report. I took it and looked at it carefully. The county plans to expand the planting of summer sweet potatoes by 60,000 mu, but as of today, only more than 4,000 mu have been planted, with more than 50,000 mu still uncompleted, and the season is already very tight. Why is the progress not fast? I repeatedly pondered this question and did not get a satisfactory answer. After discussing it with Comrade Zeng Chuntao, the secretary at home, we decided to go to Nanping Commune, where the sweet potato production task is large, to dissect this "sparrow."

    I got in the car and immediately began to think. Objectively analyzing it, the slow progress of sweet potato planting in the county is greatly related to the erratic weather this year. Since the beginning of spring, the county has suffered from six major and minor cold waves, followed by continuous drizzling rain. Sweet potato seedlings naturally cannot grow under these environmental conditions. But we Communists must not be at the mercy of fate! "Man has the power to tame the sky, and the sky has no power to tame man," this is an irrefutable truth. Therefore, upon careful analysis, the main reason for the slow progress of planting is still the word "ideology."

    When we arrived in Nanping, Commune Secretary Liu Xiangwu had gone to the production team. After listening to a brief report from the other two comrades, we learned that the sweet potato seedlings in the Dongqiao Brigade were growing well, but not many had been planted, mainly because the soil was too wet due to the rain, and they were afraid that planting them would not result in sweet potatoes, harboring a "waiting for the weather" mentality. So that's where the problem lies! This time, the root cause was dug out.

    As the saying goes, "Grains before Qingming, sweet potatoes before Mangzhong," if the sweet potato planting season is further delayed, the county's grain increase plan will be affected. Therefore, it is crucial to rush to plant all the planned summer sweet potatoes. This matter should first be clarified and highly valued ideologically by leaders at all levels.

    May 29th
    In order to specifically help a brigade organize the rush planting of sweet potatoes and set an example of completing the sweet potato planting task at high speed, I went to the Dongqiao Brigade after breakfast. Along the way, bypassing the Datang and Hanshi Brigades, the rice seedlings in the fields were growing very vigorously, and it seemed that we were fully confident of winning a great harvest in the first season.

    Dongqiao Brigade is a well-known sweet potato producing area in the county. Not only is the area large, but the yield is also relatively high. The planned summer sweet potatoes to be planted this year have almost doubled compared to last year. However, due to the weather, 50% has not been planted as of today. Based on this situation, I discussed it with the secretary of the brigade party branch and decided to make a concentrated effort tomorrow to complete it all. Therefore, it was decided to immediately convene a joint meeting of production team leaders, branch secretaries, and experienced farmers to specifically study the issue of sweet potato planting.

    This meeting was successful, both as an ideological mobilization meeting and as a meeting for Zhuge Liang to offer suggestions. Everyone was full of confidence in completing the sweet potato planting task in one day.

    May 30th
    The weather station predicted yesterday that there would be light rain today. Sure enough, when I got up, I saw light drizzle filling the sky. But this did not dampen the commune members' fighting spirit to rush to plant sweet potatoes in the slightest. In order to save time and race against the clock, people went to work at 5:30 am, and the people from the Datang and Hanshi Brigades who came from afar to provide support came even earlier. The construction sites of the five sweet potato planting zones suddenly became lively, and the songs of labor competition rose one after another.

    The commune members worked hard in the drizzle all day. When they stopped work in the evening, statistics showed that they had completed more than 520 mu.

    May 31st
    After a day of drizzling rain, it finally stopped this morning. Soon, white sails of clouds were raised above our heads again. Gradually, the sun's round face also poked out from the eastern corner of the sky, gently scattering sunlight on the beautiful mountains and rivers of the great motherland. The commune members who braved the rain to rush to plant sweet potatoes yesterday began a new battle.

    On the way back to the commune this day, I went to the Guanqiao Brigade. Encouraged by the battle slogan of "Learn from Dongqiao, Catch up with Dongqiao, Compete with Dongqiao," they are also marching towards barren and vacant land today. It seems that the call to open up wasteland and rush to plant has resounded in every corner of the county. Everyone is fighting hard to plant one more seed, plant one more seedling, and harvest one more jin of grain.

    June 1st
    I got up early and went to the Nanping Brigade to see the rice seedlings. Although only three days had passed, the changes in the rice seedlings were great. The rows were denser than three days ago, and the plants were three or four inches taller than three days ago. A gust of morning breeze blew them constantly nodding and smiling at the people, making them more and more lovely to look at.

    Today, comrades from various communes have arrived in Nanping one after another. They are here to hold an on-site meeting. According to statistics, the county has completed 94% of the summer sweet potato planting task, which marks that we have won another initiative in winning a comprehensive bumper harvest in 1960. This once again proves that as long as the leadership is determined and fully mobilizes the masses, any production difficulty can be overcome.

    下乡五天记
    中共湖南安仁县委第一书记　王川飞
    5月28日
    一缕曙光穿过东窗笔直地钻进了房内。今天又是一个晴朗天气。当前的农作物是多么需要这样的好天气呀！
    统计组送来了一张生产进度日报表，接过来仔细一看，全县计划扩种六万亩夏薯，到今天为止，只插了四千多亩，还有五万多亩没有完成，而季节已经十分紧迫了。为什么进度不快呢？我反复思索着这个问题，没有得到满意的答案。和在家的书记曾春桃同志研究后，决定到红薯生产任务较大的南坪公社去解剖这个“麻雀”。
    上了汽车，我又立即思索起来。客观地分析一下，全县插红薯进度慢与今年的天气变化无常是有很大关系的。自从开春以来，全县经受了大小六次寒流的侵袭，接着就不断地下着绵绵的阴雨。薯苗在这种环境条件下当然长不起来。可是我们共产党人决不能听天由命呀！“人有力量驯服天，天没力量驯服人”，这是确凿的真理。因此，仔细分析起来，插薯进度慢的主要原因还是在于“思想”二字了。
    到了南坪，公社书记刘祥武同志下生产队去了。听了另外两个同志的简短汇报，得知东桥大队薯苗长得好，但插的还不多，主要是由于天气下雨土太湿，怕插了不结薯，存在着“盼天”思想。原来问题就出在这里啊！这一下可把根子挖出来了。
    俗话说：“谷不过清明，薯不过芒种”，如果再把插薯的季节推迟，全县的粮食增收计划就要受到影响了。因此，把全部计划的夏薯突击插下去已是分秒不容了。这件事从各级领导干部的思想上是应该首先明确而引起高度重视的。
    5月29日
    为了具体帮助一个大队组织抢插红薯，树立高速度完成插薯任务的榜样，吃过早饭就奔往东桥大队。一路上绕过大塘、韩市大队，满垅的禾苗生长得非常茁壮旺盛，看来夺取头季大丰收是满有把握的。
    东桥大队是全县有名的红薯产地，不但面积大，产量也较高，今年计划插的夏薯比去年将近增加了二倍。但由于天气关系，到今天为止还有50％没插下去。根据这一情况，我与大队党总支书记商量了一下，准备明天突击一天，全部完成，因此决定马上召开一个生产队长和分支书、老农联席会议，具体研究一下插薯的问题。
    这个会开得成功，既是思想动员会，又是诸葛亮献计会，大家对一天完成插薯任务都充满了信心。
    5月30日
    昨天气象站预报今天有小雨。果然不错，一起来就见满天飞着毛毛雨。但这丝毫也没挫折社员们抢插红薯的斗志。为了抢时间，争分秒，人们在五点半就出了工，远道赶来支援的大塘、韩市两个大队的人来得更早。五个插薯战区的工地上顿时热闹起来，劳动竞赛的歌声此起彼伏。
    社员们顶着细雨干了一天，到傍晚收工时统计，完成了五百二十多亩。
    5月31日
    下了一天的毛毛雨，到今天早上才停下来，头顶上不一会又扬起了洁白的云帆，渐渐地太阳的圆脸也从这天幕的东角露出头来了，温柔地把阳光散射在伟大祖国的锦绣山河上。昨天冒雨抢插红薯的社员们又开始新的战斗了。
    这天在回公社的途中，顺便到官桥大队去了一趟。他们在“学东桥、赶东桥、赛东桥”的战斗口号鼓舞下，今天也在向荒土空闲地进军了。看来，大开荒、大抢种的号角已经响彻到全县每个角落去了。人人都在为多播一粒种、多栽一根苗，多收一斤粮食而奋发地战斗着。
    6月1日
    一早起来就到南坪大队去看禾苗，虽然只过了三天，禾苗的变化可大啦，行子比三天前封得更密了，植株比三天前又高出了三四寸。一阵阵晨风吹得它们不断地向人们点头微笑，叫人越看越可爱。
    今天，各公社的同志都先后赶到南坪来了，他们是来开现场会议的。经过统计，全县已完成了夏薯播种任务的94％，这标志着我们夺取1960年全面大丰收又打胜了一个主动仗。从这里又一次证明：只要领导有决心，充分把群众发动起来，任何生产难关都是可以突破的。
