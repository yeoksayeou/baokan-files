    Japanese Socialist Party Issues Statement
    Use Struggle to Bury the U.S.-Japan Military Treaty
    General Election Should Be Held Under a Caretaker Cabinet; Oppose the Ascension of a Second Nobusuke Kishi

    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 23rd: The Japanese Socialist Party issued a statement today, condemning the Kishi Nobusuke government's exchange of ratification documents with the United States for the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and expressing its determination to struggle to crush this military treaty.

    The statement said that the new "Security Treaty" has no binding force or authority over the Japanese people. The Socialist Party pledges to wage a struggle to bury the new "Security Treaty" and to crush the political and social system maintained by the "Security Treaty."

    The Socialist Party held a meeting of the Central Executive Committee today and decided that Socialist Party Diet members will return to their respective constituencies from June 25th to launch a mass movement to deny the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and demand the immediate dissolution of the Diet.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 23rd: Inejiro Asanuma, Chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party, said at a press conference on the afternoon of the 22nd that the next government should be a caretaker government, and a general election should be held under this government. He went on to say that after the collapse of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, the parties responsible for hastily "passing" the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" should be excluded from the government. Asanuma pointed out that, therefore, the Socialist Party should become the core of the caretaker cabinet that replaces the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet.

    Kiyoshi Katsumata, Director of the Education and Propaganda Bureau of the Socialist Party, when clarifying Asanuma's remarks to Japanese newspaper reporters, said that the Socialist Party and the people will never recognize Nobusuke Kishi transferring power to another conservative leader whose hands are as dirty as Kishi's.

    Katsumata also said, "We have not yet reached a definitive agreement on which parties should be included in the caretaker government. But I can say that, regarding the formation of the next cabinet, we will encourage the anti-Kishi faction, the anti-Ikeda faction, and the anti-Yoshida faction among the ruling party's anti-mainstream groups."

    日本人民决心粉碎日美军事同盟条约
    日本人民决不容许第二个岸信介内阁上台
    日本社会党发表声明
    要用斗争葬送日美军事条约
    应在看守内阁下主持大选　反对第二个岸信介登台
    据新华社23日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天发表声明，抨击岸信介政府同美国交换新日美“安全条约”批准书，表示要为粉碎这项军事条约而斗争。
    声明说，新“安全条约”对日本人民既没有约束力，也没有权力。社会党保证将进行斗争来葬送新“安全条约”和粉碎“安全条约”所维持的政治和社会制度。
    社会党今天召开中央执行委员会会议决定，社会党国会议员将从6月25日起分别回到各地选区，展开不承认新日美“安全条约”、要求立即解散国会的群众运动。
    新华社23日讯　东京消息：日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎22日下午在记者招待会上说，下届政府应当是一个看守政府，应当在这个政府之下举行大选。他接着说，在岸信介内阁垮台以后，应对匆匆“通过”新日美“安全条约”负责的各政党应当被排除在政权之外。浅沼指出，因此，社会党应成为接替岸信介内阁的看守内阁的核心。
    社会党教育宣传局局长胜间田清一在阐明浅沼的谈话时向日本报纸记者说，社会党和人民决不承认岸信介把权力转移给双手同岸信介一样肮脏的另一名保守党领袖。
    胜间又说，“我们对于哪一些政党应包括在看守政府以内还没有达成肯定的协议。可是我可以说，关于成立下届内阁问题我们将鼓励执政党反主流派中的反岸派、反池田派和反吉田派”。
