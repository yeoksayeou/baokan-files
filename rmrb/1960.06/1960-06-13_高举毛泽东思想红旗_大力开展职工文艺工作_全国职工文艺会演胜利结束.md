Xinhua News Agency, 12th: The National Workers' Art Festival held in the capital has concluded successfully. In this festival, delegations from various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions presented over six hundred rich and colorful music, dance, drama, and ballad programs, enthusiastically praising the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, extolling the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, the People's Commune, and heroes from all fields, vividly reflecting the current rapidly developing technical revolution, cultural revolution, and urban People's Commune movement. More than 80% of these programs were created by workers, and one-third of the performers were advanced producers and advanced workers.

During the festival, Party and state leaders watched the workers' performances and met with all the delegates, giving them great encouragement. Responsible comrades from relevant central departments also gave reports to the delegates. Literary and art workers from the capital held various professional seminars with the workers participating in the festival, learning from each other and exchanging experiences. Professional literary and art workers unanimously praised the workers' creative and performing arts programs as not only possessing a strong spirit of the times and a rich atmosphere of life but also being artistically bold in creation and courageous in innovation, providing great inspiration for professional literary and art work. They admired the worker-amateur actors' ability to use short, concise, vivid programs to express new things and were pleasantly surprised by the emergence of so many outstanding performing arts talents in the workers' art teams, as well as "double standard bearers" who were good at both production and art. After watching this festival, many professional art workers further realized that the fiery political struggle and production struggle are an inexhaustible source of artistic creation.

On the evening of May 31, a grand closing ceremony was held at the Great Hall of the People in the capital. Zhu De, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Li Xiannian, Vice Premier of the State Council, as well as representatives from various countries attending the World Federation of Trade Unions Council, attended the closing ceremony. At the closing ceremony, more than 2,700 representatives of worker-amateur art workers participating in the festival unanimously passed "A Letter to National Worker Art Activists." The representatives expressed that they would hold even higher the banner of Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art, vigorously develop workers' cultural and artistic work, promote the more extensive and in-depth development of the technical revolution, cultural revolution, and urban People's Commune movement, and create more and better literary and artistic works worthy of the great Mao Zedong era. At the closing ceremony, Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of Culture, presented awards to the performers on behalf of the five organizers: the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Ministry of Culture, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the All-China Women's Federation, and the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles. Delegations from various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions jointly performed wonderful programs such as the chorus "The East is Red," "Song of the Builders," and "Condemning the Imperialist Wolfish Ambitions," and the festival ended in an exceptionally warm atmosphere.

During the festival, delegates from various regions also performed in factories, people's communes, troops, schools, and government agencies in the capital. (Attached picture)
