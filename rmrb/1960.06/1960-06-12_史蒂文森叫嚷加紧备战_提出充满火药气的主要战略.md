Xinhua News Agency, Washington, June 11th: Former Democratic presidential candidate Stevenson, often referred to as the Democratic Party's "titular leader," has recently delivered a series of speeches, emulating Republican figures by vehemently slandering the Soviet Union and vigorously advocating for intensified arms expansion and war preparations.

In a speech delivered on June 5th, Stevenson maligned the Soviet Union, stating that "Russia's failure to expand its territory during its rapid economic and scientific growth is a major factor in the Soviet Union's shift towards a more aggressive foreign policy."

Like Eisenhower, Nixon, Herter, and others, Stevenson seized upon the opportunity presented by the United States' sabotage of the Four-Power Summit to promote the intensification of the "Cold War" and preparations for a "hot war."

In a speech delivered on June 1st, he proposed a "major strategy" to "regain the initiative in the Cold War" and "restore confidence in American leadership." This plan, filled with the scent of gunpowder, advocated for the establishment, together with the NATO countries, of a "deterrent force and the capacity for limited warfare," targeting the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, "without relying on bureaucratic budget management." Regarding this, he explicitly stated the need to spur Western European countries to greater efforts, saying, "Our European allies can make greater contributions to the common military force." He clamored for the "free world to establish a stronger political and economic bloc" and to establish an Atlantic Council to strengthen the Western alliance. This council would formulate "joint" military and economic policies of the NATO aggressive bloc countries "within a larger economic scope." He also proposed to rally allies to participate in controlling "long-term aid programs for impoverished countries." He clamored to "formulate new and bolder principles for aiding underdeveloped areas."

He also confused right and wrong by attributing the United States' sabotage of the Four-Power Summit to a "failure of policy on both sides, Eisenhower and Khrushchev." Prior to this, Stevenson had slanderously claimed that the Four-Power Summit "was sabotaged by Khrushchev."

In a speech at the end of May, when talking about the West Berlin issue, Stevenson also clamored that the West should adhere to its position against the normalization of the situation in West Berlin, and that the United States must "firmly" oppose the so-called "Communist threat in Berlin."

    史蒂文森叫嚷加紧备战
    提出充满火药气的主要战略
    据新华社11日讯　华盛顿消息：被称为美国民主党“名义领袖”的前民主党总统候选人史蒂文森近来连续发表演说，像共和党的头子们一样，极力诬蔑苏联并大力鼓吹加紧扩军备战。
    史蒂文森在5日发表的一篇演说里诬蔑苏联说，“俄国在经济和科学方面迅速增长的期间，没有能够扩张它的领土，这是苏联转向更加富有侵略性的对外政策的一个主要因素。”
    同艾森豪威尔、尼克松、赫脱之流一样，史蒂文森利用美国破坏四国政府首脑会议的机会来鼓吹加紧进行“冷战”和准备“热战”。
    他在6月1日发表的一篇演说中，提出了“挽回（美国）在冷战中的主动权”和“恢复对美国领导的信心”的“主要战略”。这个充满火药气味的计划鼓吹同北大西洋集团国家一起建立一支针对苏联和其他社会主义国家的“不依靠管理预算的官僚们的威慑力量和进行有限战争的能力”。关于这一点，他明白表示要鞭策西欧国家更多卖力，他说，“我们的欧洲盟国可以对共同的军事力量作出更大的贡献”。他叫嚣“自由世界建立一个更强有力的政治和经济集团”，并建立一个大西洋理事会，加强西方的联盟。这个理事会拟订北大西洋侵略集团国家“在一个更大经济范围内的”“共同”的军事和经济政策等。他还提出要纠集盟国参加控制“贫困国家的长期援助计划”。他叫嚷要“为援助不发达地区制定新的、更大胆的原则”。
    他还混淆黑白地把美国破坏四国首脑会议说成是艾森豪威尔和赫鲁晓夫“双方政策的失败”。在这以前，史蒂文森曾颠倒黑白地诽谤说四国政府首脑会议“是赫鲁晓夫破坏的”。
    史蒂文森在5月底的一次讲话中谈到西柏林问题时，还叫嚷西方要固守反对西柏林局势正常化的立场，美国必须“坚定地”反对所谓“共产党在柏林的威胁”。
