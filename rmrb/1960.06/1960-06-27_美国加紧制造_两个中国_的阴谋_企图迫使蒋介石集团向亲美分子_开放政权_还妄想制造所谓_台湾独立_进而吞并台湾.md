Xinhua News Agency, June 26th – In the period surrounding the "visit" of U.S. imperialism's chieftain Eisenhower to Taiwan, numerous reports from Washington, New York, London, Taipei, Hong Kong, and other places indicate that the United States is intensifying its conspiracy to "isolate Taiwan" and then "trusteeship Taiwan."

When Eisenhower was still in Taipei on June 19th, the BBC in London issued a commentary stating, "We cannot predict what changes will immediately occur in American policy," but in the United States, "the idea of 'two Chinas,' or even placing Formosa under United Nations 'trusteeship,' will be discussed more and more frequently. ... The American side has already hinted that Eisenhower should strive to promote such a solution during his visit."

Before Eisenhower's visit to Taiwan, United Press International reported from Washington that one of Eisenhower's original purposes in going to Taiwan was to contact pro-American elements in Taiwan. The report said that U.S. Democratic Congressman Porter had suggested that Eisenhower hold talks with so-called "Taiwanese leaders," and Eisenhower replied through his administrative assistant that he would "guarantee consideration."

The day after Eisenhower and Chiang Kai-shek issued a joint communiqué on June 19th, the U.S. magazine "Newsweek" published in its "Periscope" column on June 20th a report from Taipei stating that Eisenhower had made two "tough suggestions not included in the official communiqué" to Chiang Kai-shek: First, "Reduce your (referring to Chiang Kai-shek) garrison in Kinmen and Matsu;" Second, "Let more of the eight million Formosan natives participate in the Kuomintang administration." The purpose of this American scheme is to force the Chiang Kai-shek clique to "open up the government" to opposition parties supported by the United States, such as Taiwan's "Free China elements," Taiwanese local forces, and a small group of "Taiwan independence elements" led by the traitor Liao Wenyi, to facilitate the U.S. implementation of the policies of "Taiwan independence" and "trusteeship of Taiwan."

As early as October 22nd of last year, Eisenhower had already put forward the fallacy of more than forty countries "recognizing the independence of Formosa" at a press conference. On February 27th of this year, the U.S. magazine "National Review" published a report stating that U.S. "Secretary of State Herter and his special advisor on Soviet affairs, Bohlen, secretly met with Eisenhower twice, trying to find a way to make Eisenhower accept their solution to the Taiwan problem, which is to force Chiang Kai-shek to step down and make Formosa a protectorate of the United Nations." After these reports came out, for several months, the calls for "Taiwan independence," "UN trusteeship of Taiwan," and "referendums" in the United States have been more intense than before. The common point of these calls is to advocate that the United States quickly abandon its current policy of supporting the Chiang Kai-shek clique and find another guise such as "Taiwan independence" or "trusteeship" and support another group of puppets to achieve the U.S. goal of directly annexing Taiwan. According to a report in the U.S. "Christian Science Monitor" on April 16th, the "Foreign Policy Association" in the United States even held a so-called "opinion poll," saying that "many people are in favor of establishing 'an independent Taiwan.'" Former U.S. Ambassador to India Bowles wrote in an issue of the American "Foreign Affairs" quarterly published in March, advocating that the United States build Taiwan "into a free entity," "an independent Formosa," and that the American occupation army "guarantee its security." The "suggestions" published by former U.S. Representative to the United Nations Jessup on May 4th further exposed the specific content of the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to seize Taiwan through a so-called "referendum." Jessup said that the United States should "offer the people of Taiwan a free referendum under the supervision of the United Nations" to allow Taiwanese residents to choose "as a separate country," or "recombine with Japan," or "be under the trusteeship of the United Nations," etc. And "no matter which solution is adopted," the United States must "maintain a collective self-defense treaty with Taiwan, either alone or together with other countries," that is, the U.S. military will continue to occupy Taiwan. U.S. Democratic Senators Clark, Porter, Engel, etc., have also repeatedly made noises about "Taiwan independence," "trusteeship of Taiwan," and Taiwan "internationalization."

At the same time, some influential bourgeois newspapers in the United States have recently repeatedly rehashed the cliché of "two Chinas." On June 16th, the "New York Times" and the "New York Post" both published news of pro-American elements in Taiwan issuing anti-Chiang statements and expressed their support. The "New York Post" also published an editorial fiercely attacking the Taiwan Kuomintang authorities and inciting so-called "Taiwanese independence."

With the support and instigation of the United States, pro-American elements in Taiwan are also cooperating with American policy and launching fierce attacks on the Chiang Kai-shek clique. These pro-American Taiwanese "Free China elements" Lei Zhen and Taiwanese local forces Li Wanjü, Gao Yushu, etc., were very active during Eisenhower's "visit" to Taiwan and announced on June 15th that they were preparing to establish an "opposition party." On June 17th, anti-Chiang slogans appeared in several places on the streets of Taipei.

As early as March 8th of this year, the West German "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" exposed the American attempt to establish a "Republic of Taiwan" and replace Chiang Kai-shek and Chen Cheng with Hu Shi in a report entitled "One China and One Taiwan." The newspaper's reporter, Lily Abegg, wrote, "American people are willing to see today's Vice President Chen Cheng succeed Chiang Kai-shek as President of the Republic of China (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek clique). It is said that Chen Cheng's successor is the liberal and realistic Professor Hu Shi. Then, Hu Shi may be the first president of an independent Republic of Taiwan."

The Taiwan "Free China" bi-monthly, which is sponsored by pro-American elements such as Hu Shi and Lei Zhen, is cooperating with their activities to organize an "opposition party" and has recently been constantly advocating that the United States should abandon the Chiang Kai-shek clique as soon as possible. It said that Eisenhower's visit to Taiwan "is a very powerful spiritual encouragement and moral support to the pro-American elements in Taiwan, and its significance and value will be inestimable." It "demands that the dictatorial anti-communists (referring to Chiang Kai-shek) step down and be replaced by true democratic anti-communists" from the United States, that is, the "opposition party" to be established will replace the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

Pro-American anti-Chiang elements in the United States and Hong Kong are also echoing the event of pro-American elements in Taiwan organizing an "opposition party." The Hong Kong "United Review" weekly and "Motherland Weekly," etc., which are printed with American money, have successively published articles and commentaries such as "About Chiang Kai-shek" and "Removing the Root of Disaster in Taiwan - Chiang Ching-kuo," "complaining" to the Americans that "Chiang Kai-shek's coffin has not yet been closed but his fate has already been decided" and that he cannot better act as an American lackey, and urging Eisenhower to abandon the Chiang Kai-shek clique as soon as possible. Pro-American elements Wu Jingfu, Xie Fuya, etc., who live in the United States, also scolded Chiang Kai-shek in publications such as the New York "China-America Weekly," saying that he should be subject to "severe American sanctions," and repeatedly said that they "deny that Chiang Kai-shek is the legitimate third-term president."

Another pawn the United States has placed in Tokyo is a small group of "Taiwan independence elements" led by the traitor Liao Wenyi, who, under the instruction of the United States, issued a scream on June 18th, calling for Eisenhower to advocate "the immediate supervision of Taiwan by the United Nations." Under the support of the United States and the protection of Japanese militarism, Liao Wenyi announced the establishment of the so-called "Provisional Government of the Republic of Taiwan" in Tokyo as early as February 1956. This puppet organization, in coordination with the American conspiracy to annex Taiwan, has repeatedly requested the United Nations to "trusteeship Taiwan."

Taiwan's Kuomintang official newspapers and periodicals such as "Chung Hwa Daily News" and "Political Review" bi-monthly have recently published articles exposing the United States' support for pro-American elements in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and other places, and the fact that the United States Information Service, the Asia Foundation, and other organizations have used a large amount of "U.S. aid" to provide pro-American elements with publications such as the Taiwan "Free China" bi-monthly, the Hong Kong "United Review" weekly, "Motherland Weekly," and the establishment of the anti-Chiang "Youlian Bookstore," etc.

Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory, and the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan. The Chinese people will never allow U.S. imperialism's any "trusteeship of Taiwan," "Taiwan independence," etc., conspiracies to create "two Chinas" to permanently occupy Taiwan to succeed.

### 美国加紧制造“两个中国”的阴谋  企图迫使蒋介石集团向亲美分子“开放政权”  还妄想制造所谓“台湾独立”进而吞并台湾

    美国加紧制造“两个中国”的阴谋
    企图迫使蒋介石集团向亲美分子“开放政权”
    还妄想制造所谓“台湾独立”进而吞并台湾
    新华社26日讯　在美帝国主义头子艾森豪威尔“访问”台湾前后，从华盛顿、纽约、伦敦、台北、香港等地传来许多消息，表明美国正在加紧推行其“孤立台湾”进而“托管台湾”的阴谋。
    当艾森豪威尔在6月19日还逗留在台北的时候，英国广播公司即从伦敦发表了一篇评论说，“我们还不能预言美国的政策马上会有什么变化”，但是，在美国，“‘两个中国’的主张，或者甚至把福摩萨交由联合国‘托管’的谈论将越来越频繁。……美国方面早已经有了这种暗示：艾森豪威尔在他的访问中应该努力促进这样一种解决办法”。
    在艾森豪威尔访台前，美国合众国际社曾从华盛顿发出消息，说艾森豪威尔去台湾的原定目的之一是想和台湾的亲美分子接触。消息说，美国民主党众议员波特尔曾建议艾森豪威尔同所谓“台湾人领袖”举行会谈，艾森豪威尔通过他的行政助理复信说“保证将予考虑”。
    艾森豪威尔和蒋介石在6月19日发表会谈联合公报的次日，美国“新闻周刊”即在6月20日在“潜望镜栏”中刊载了来自台北的消息说，艾森豪威尔曾向蒋介石提出了两个“没有列入正式公报里的强硬建议”，内容是：一、“削减你（指蒋介石）在金门和马祖的驻军；”二、“国民党政务让八百万福摩萨本地人当中有更多的人来干。”美国这一图谋的目的就是要蒋介石集团“开放政权”给美国支持下的反对派，如台湾“自由中国分子”、台湾地方势力分子和以汉奸廖文毅为首的一小撮“台湾独立分子”，以便于美国推行“台湾独立”、“托管台湾”的政策。
    早在去年10月22日，艾森豪威尔已在记者招待会上提出所谓有四十多个国家“承认福摩萨的独立”的谬论。到了今年2月27日，美国“国民评论”周刊又登载了一条消息说，美国“国务卿赫脱和他的苏联事务特别顾问波伦同艾森豪威尔秘密会晤了两次，想设法使艾森豪威尔接受他们的台湾问题的解决办法，这就是使蒋介石下台，使福摩萨成为联合国的保护国”。这些消息传出以后，几个月来，美国国内关于“台湾独立”、“联合国托管台湾”和“公民投票”等等叫喊，比以前更加厉害。这些叫喊的共同点是主张美国赶快抛弃目前支持蒋介石集团的政策，而另找一件“台湾独立”或“托管”之类的外衣和扶植另外一帮傀儡，来达到美国直接吞并台湾的目的。据美国“基督教科学箴言报”4月16日报道，“美国外交政策协会”为此还举办了所谓“民意测验”，说是“有很多人赞成成立‘一个独立的台湾’”。前美国驻印度大使鲍尔士在3月出版的一期美国“外交”季刊上著文，鼓吹美国把台湾建立“成为一个自由的实体”的“独立的福摩萨”，而由美国占领军“保障它的安全”。前美国驻联合国代表杰塞普在5月4日发表的“建议”，更暴露了美国帝国主义企图通过所谓“公民投票”霸占台湾的阴谋的具体内容。杰塞普说，美国应该“向台湾人民提供在联合国监督下举行自由的公民投票”，让台湾居民选择“作为一个单独的国家”、或“重新和日本结合”、或“由联合国托管”等。而且“不管通过的是那种解决办法”，美国都要“单独地或和其他国家一起同台湾保持一项集体自卫条约”，也就是由美军继续霸占台湾。美国民主党参议员克拉克、波尔特、恩格尔等，也一再发出“台湾独立”、“托管台湾”和台湾“国际化”等喧嚷。
    与此同时，美国的一些有影响的资产阶级报纸近来也一再重弹
  “两个中国”的滥调。6月16日，
  “纽约时报”和“纽约邮报”都刊登了台湾亲美分子发表反蒋声明的消息，并且表示给予支持。“纽约邮报”还发表社论猛烈攻击台湾国民党当局，并且鼓动所谓“台湾人独立”。
    在美国的支持和策动下，台湾的亲美分子也配合着美国的政策，而对蒋介石集团发动了猛烈的攻击。这些亲美的台湾“自由中国分子”雷震和台湾地方势力分子李万居、高玉树等，在艾森豪威尔“访问”台湾的时候大肆活跃，在6月15日宣布筹备成立“反对党”。6月17日，台北市街头几个地方出现了反蒋标语。
    早在今年3月8日，西德“法兰克福汇报”在一篇题为“一个中国和一个台湾”的报道中，已暴露了美国企图成立“台湾共和国”和以胡适取代蒋介石、陈诚的位置。该报记者莉莉·阿贝格写道，“美国人士愿意看到今日的副总统陈诚接替蒋介石出任中华民国（指蒋介石集团）总统。据说，陈诚的后继人就是自由派的、现实的教授胡适。然后，胡适就可能是独立的台湾共和国的第一任总统。”
    由胡适、雷震等亲美分子主办的台湾“自由中国”半月刊，配合着他们组织“反对党”的活动，最近不断鼓吹美国应该尽快抛弃蒋介石集团。它说，艾森豪威尔访问台湾，对台湾的亲美分子“是一个至为有力的精神鼓励与道义支持，其意义与价值，将是无法估计的”。它向美国“要求独裁的反共者（指蒋介石）下台，而代之以真正的民主反共”，即由将成立的“反对党”取代蒋介石集团的位置。
    在美国和香港等地的亲美反蒋分子，也与台湾亲美分子筹组“反对党”事件遥相呼应。由美国人出钱印行的香港“联合评论”周刊和“祖国周刊”等，连续发表“关于蒋介石”、“除去台湾的祸根——蒋经国”等文章和评论，向美国人“告状”说“蒋介石棺未盖而论已定”，不能更好地充当美国走狗的脚色，要艾森豪威尔尽快抛弃蒋介石集团。居住在美国的亲美分子吴敬敷、谢扶雅等，也在纽约“中美周报”等出版物上大骂蒋介石，说他应受美国“严厉之制裁”，并且口口声声说他们“否认蒋介石是合法的第三届总统”。
    美国摆在东京的另一着棋子是以汉奸廖文毅为首的一小撮“台湾独立分子”，也在美国的授意下，在6月18日发出嘶喊，要艾森豪威尔倡导“立即由联合国监督台湾”。在美国的扶植和日本军国主义的包庇下，廖文毅早在1956年2月即在东京宣布成立所谓“台湾共和国临时政府”。这个傀儡组织配合着美国吞并台湾的阴谋，一再要求联合国“托管台湾”。
    台湾国民党官方报刊“中华日报”、“政治评论”半月刊等，最近连续刊载文章揭发美国支持台湾、香港、东京等地的亲美分子，并且由美国新闻处、美国亚洲基金会等用大量“美援”供给亲美分子出版台湾“自由中国”半月刊、香港“联合评论”周刊、“祖国周刊”和开设反蒋的“友联书报公司”等事实。
    台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分，中国人民一定要解放台湾。中国人民决不容许美帝国主义任何“托管台湾”、“台湾独立”等等制造“两个中国”企图永远霸占台湾的阴谋得逞。
