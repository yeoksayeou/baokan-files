    Buying Oil

    At noon on June 8th, the blue sky was without a single cloud. Li Encai, the accountant of the Wenchengying District Credit Cooperative in our county, had just returned from Wangqiansi Bank, twenty *li* away, after reporting accounts under the scorching sun, sweating profusely. He was just about to take a break by the roadside when he heard that our oil for the "pot camel" machine was running low. The commune members had gone to three distribution stores around to buy it, but all the oil had been sold out. Li Encai thought: If we can't buy oil today, the "pot camel" machine won't be able to start to rush-plant corn tomorrow, and that's a big deal. He forgot his fatigue, and while eating two cornbread buns, he volunteered to buy oil. He rode a bicycle, first to a place twenty *li* away to buy, then to a place thirty *li* away, and then to a place forty *li* away. Finally, in one breath, he rode to the Fucheng Central Store in Jiaohe, fifty *li* away, and bought fifty-two *jin* of oil for the "pot camel" machine. By the time he rushed back to the location of our drought resistance army, it was already after 11 o'clock at night. Li Encai's spirit of wholeheartedly serving agricultural production moved everyone, and everyone actively prepared overnight to welcome the battle before dawn.

    买油
    6月8日的中午，蓝蓝的天上没有一丝云彩。咱们县文成营区信用部的会计李恩才，头顶烈日刚从二十里外的王千寺银行报账回来，热得满头大汗。他正想在路旁歇歇，可是听说我们的锅驼机油不够了，社员们跑到周围的三个分销商店去买，油都卖光了。李恩才想：如果今天买不到油，明天锅驼机就不能开动赶种玉米，这可是件大事。他忘记了疲累，一边拿上两个窝窝头吃着，一边自告奋勇去买油。他骑了一辆自行车，先到二十里路外去买，接着又跑到三十里路外、四十里路外去买，最后一口气跑到五十里路外的交河阜城中心商店才买到了五十二斤锅驼机用的油。等他赶回我们抗旱大军所在地时，已是深夜十一点多钟了。李恩才热心为农业生产服务的精神感动了大家，大家连夜积极准备迎接黎明前的战斗。
