Three Parts Planting, Seven Parts Management: Manage Early, Manage Well, Ensure a Bumper Harvest
Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, and Sichuan Vigorously Strengthen Field Management of Spring-Sown Crops

    (Our newspaper Hohhot, 8th) Inner Mongolia's various ethnic farmers are launching a field management campaign with high efficiency and good quality. Now, the early-sown crops have generally emerged from the soil, and the fields are green everywhere. The earliest-sown spring wheat seedlings are more than three inches tall, and some of the wheat seedlings irrigated in the Hetao Plain are about a foot tall. Currently, the vast majority of wheat fields in the region are first and second-class fields with full, uniform, and strong seedlings.

    "Early start leads to complete proactivity" is the prominent characteristic of Inner Mongolia's agricultural production this year. While rushing to plant large fields, farmers of all ethnic groups began field management work. All localities have established field management command organizations headed by party committee secretaries, and have organized professional labor to carry out this work. After the crops were sown, the farmers of all ethnic groups conducted a large-scale inspection and comparison campaign to check and replant seedlings, and increased labor and additional measures to upgrade weak seedlings. According to incomplete statistics, more than 2.8 million mu of various crops have been hoed, 700,000 mu of green seedlings have been irrigated, and 184,000 mu have been replanted with fertilizer. The commune members of all ethnic groups on the Hetao Plain, one of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's "granaries," are now working day and night to intensively irrigate, weed, and apply additional fertilizer to strengthen field management. The 1.1 million mu of spring wheat that has been managed is presenting a lush green scene.

    Timely and appropriate irrigation is the main experience that has led to bumper harvests in the Hetao Plain for years. This year, the main canals in the Hetao irrigation area generally released water for greening half a month to twenty days earlier than last year. By May 22, the entire irrigation area had irrigated more than 477,000 mu of spring wheat and 29,000 mu of rice. At the same time, 455,000 mu of wheat fields were weeded and 97,000 mu were top-dressed with fertilizer. Many people's communes in Linhe County, Wuyuan County, and Hangjin Rear Banner renovated field water conservancy projects and established and improved irrigation and flood control organizations before watering, and promoted the advanced irrigation system of "shallow watering, quick rotation, and economical water use," improving the quality of irrigation.

    Inner Mongolia has achieved great success this year in implementing the agricultural production policy of simultaneous multiple planting and high-yield multiple harvests during spring sowing. Now, the region has successfully completed the task of planting large fields ahead of schedule. The planting area of ​​major food crops such as wheat, corn, millet, and sorghum has exceeded the original plan by more than 1%. The planting area of ​​high-yield crops in various places has reached 30 million mu. In the eastern part of Inner Mongolia, mixed planting of corn and soybeans has been universally promoted, and soybeans have also been planted in millet fields in the western part. The mixed planting area in Hulunbuir League and Zhaowuda League alone has reached more than 4.36 million mu. More than half of the newly reclaimed 4 million mu of wasteland has been sown. At the same time, large-scale high-yield campaigns have been launched in various places, and more than 6.21 million mu of low-yield fields have been improved. Based on the above situation, the Autonomous Region Party Committee pointed out that various crops will grow at the same time, weeds will be numerous, technical requirements will be high, management will be labor-intensive, and labor will be tight during the summer hoeing season this year. Therefore, it called on party committees at all levels to properly arrange rural labor, vigorously promote the reform of summer hoeing tools, and vigorously organize all walks of life to support agricultural production, lead farmers of all ethnic groups to start early, manage as soon as they plant, manage well and carefully, manage to the end, and strive for a complete victory in field management to ensure a bumper harvest in agricultural production this year.

    (Xinhua News Agency) Under the guiding ideology of managing as soon as planting and managing early and well, Shaanxi Province immediately launched a high tide of seedling management centered on checking seedlings and replanting, preventing insects, thinning seedlings, and cultivating in the middle of the field as soon as spring sowing ended.

    This year, Shaanxi Province has planted more and better spring-sown crops of various types than in previous years. Most of the spring-sown fields have been carefully cultivated, strip-sown by machine, and more fertilizer has been applied than in previous years.

    However, due to the lack of soil moisture before planting and excessive rain after planting, and the fluctuating temperature, some spring-sown fields had broken ridges and missing seedlings. In response to this situation, all localities immediately launched a mass campaign to check seedlings and replant them as soon as the seedlings emerged from the soil. After the inspection, Yan'an Prefecture found that more than 10,000 mu of spring-sown fields were missing seedlings, and immediately organized labor to replant all of them. In the cotton-producing areas of Guanzhong Weinan and other six counties, one million farmers were organized to transplant seedlings to more than 700,000 mu of cotton fields, and replanting was carried out in places where sowing was not possible, such as roadsides, canal sides, field edges, and corners. In Hanzhong Prefecture in southern Shaanxi, where the most rice is grown, the people's communes in these areas immediately took measures to shallowly irrigate, sun the fields, and apply quick-acting fertilizers to ensure that the rice fields were full of strong seedlings due to the repeated attacks of cold air that slowed down the growth of rice seedlings.

    This year, the area where cotton aphids occurred in the cotton-growing areas of Shaanxi Province is larger than last year. All cotton-producing areas have carried out blitzkriegs against cotton aphids. From the beginning of May to the 15th, Huxian County organized more than 1,750 insect prevention commando teams, mobilized all the medicine and machinery, and sprinkled 666 powder on the cotton fields with cotton aphids. As of May 25, more than 2 million mu had been treated in the province. In conjunction with the prevention and control of cotton aphids, the province also carried out middle-plowing and weeding on more than 2 million mu of cotton fields.

    (Xinhua News Agency) Sichuan is strengthening field management of spring-sown crops to promote full, uniform, and healthy growth of seedlings, and strive for high yields and bumper harvests.

    This year, the planting area of ​​various spring-sown crops in Sichuan Province has been expanded compared with previous years, and the planting has been earlier and better. After sowing, all localities immediately conducted large-scale inspections and comparisons, and educated commune members with the facts that field management was different last year and the yield was very different, so that the broad masses further realized the importance of "three parts planting, seven parts management." Party organizations at all levels have made comprehensive arrangements for labor and strengthened the organization and leadership of field management of spring-sown crops. Each commune in Jiajiang County formed field management professional teams by crop, and generally achieved watering once every three days, fertilizing once every five days, no drought in sunny days, and no flooding in rainy days. The early rice, early corn, sweet potatoes, cotton, peanuts and other crops in the county have basically achieved no weeds, no diseases and insect pests, no missing nests, and no weak seedlings. In order to manage early corn well, many communes in Wanxian Prefecture had a deputy secretary and captain in charge of leading corn production from the commune to the team. Various places have also generally formed corn field management professional teams and groups with the management area or production team as the unit, and implemented production responsibility systems such as fixed plots, fixed labor, fixed time, and fixed quality.

    In the field management of spring-sown crops, leading cadres at all levels have vigorously developed command fields to guide and promote large-scale production. The leading comrades of the Nanbu County Party Committee discovered soil silkworms and armyworms in the command fields of Nanlong Commune, and immediately held a telephone conference to carry out a blitz to control insects and eliminate insect pests as soon as possible. Now, the cotton fields in the county have been replanted with all the missing nests, and they are growing neatly and strongly.

    In view of the characteristics that the temperature was high last winter and this spring, the number of overwintering pests that died was small, so the number of major spring pests this year was large, the reproduction was fast, and the time for harming crops was also advanced, various places strengthened the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests as early as possible. Each commune in Xinfan County established a professional group for the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests with the management area as the unit, and sprayed all early spring crops with pesticides two or three times to ensure the normal growth of crops.

    三分种七分管　管早管好保丰收
    内蒙古陕西四川大力加强春播作物田间管理
    本报呼和浩特8日电　内蒙古各族农民展开工效高、质量好的田间管理运动。现在，早种的农作物已经普遍出土，田野到处一片翠绿，播种最早的春小麦苗高都在三寸以上，河套平原经过灌溉的麦苗有的已有一尺左右。现在，全区绝大部分麦田都是苗全、苗齐、苗壮的一、二类田。
    “一早百早，步步主动”是内蒙古今年农业生产的突出特点，各族农民在抢种大田的同时，便开始了田间管理工作。各地普遍成立了以党委书记为首的田间管理指挥机构，组织了专业劳动力进行这项工作。各族农民在农作物播种以后，便进行了大检查、大评比的查苗补苗运动，并增加劳力，追加措施，使弱苗升级。据不完全统计，全区现已锄过各种作物二百八十多万亩，浇青苗七十万亩，有十八万四千亩补追了肥料。内蒙古自治区“粮仓”之一的河套平原上的各族公社社员，现正在日夜突击灌溉、锄草和增施肥料，加强田间管理工作。经过管理的一百一十多万亩春小麦，呈现出一片碧绿。
    适时适量地进行灌溉，是河套平原历年获得丰收的主要经验。今年河套灌区各大干渠普遍比去年提前半个月到二十天放水浇青。到5月22日，全灌区已灌溉春小麦四十七万七千多亩、水稻二万九千多亩。同时锄麦田四十五万五千亩，追肥九万七千多亩。临河县、五原县和杭锦后旗不少人民公社，在浇地前整修了田间水利工程和建立与健全了灌溉防洪机构，推行“浅浇快轮和经济用水”的先进灌溉制度，提高了灌溉质量。
    内蒙古今年在春播中，贯彻执行多种多收与高产多收同时并举的农业生产方针获得很大成绩。现在，全区已提前一个节令胜利完成大田播种任务。小麦、玉米、谷子、高粱等主要粮食作物播种面积都比原订计划超额1％以上。各地高产作物播种面积达三千万亩。内蒙古东部地区普遍推行了玉米、大豆混种，西部地区也在谷子地里种植了大豆。仅呼伦贝尔盟和昭乌达盟混种面积便达四百三十六万多亩。新开垦的四百多万亩荒地，有一半以上已经播种。同时，各地都展开了大面积丰产运动，并改良了六百二十一万多亩低产田。根据以上情况，自治区党委指出，今年在夏锄时期将出现各种作物齐头并长，杂草多，技术要求高，管理费工和劳动力紧张等特点。因而号召各级党委妥善安排农村劳动力，大搞夏锄工具改革运动和大力组织各行各业支援农业生产，领导各族农民及早动手，种上就管，管好管细，一管到底，争取田间管理工作获得全胜，保证今年农业生产大丰收。
    据新华社讯　在种下就管、管早管好的指导思想下，陕西省春播一结束就立刻掀起了一个以查苗补苗、防虫、间苗、中耕为中心的幼苗管理高潮。
    今年陕西省各类春播作物比往年种得又多又好。绝大部分春播田都作到了精耕细作，采取条播机播，施肥也比往年多。
    但由于种前缺墒，种后多雨，气温忽高忽低，因此有部分春播田断垅缺苗。针对这种情况，各地在幼苗一出土，就立即开展了群众性的查苗补苗运动。延安专区在检查后，发现有一万多亩春播田缺苗，立即组织劳力全部进行了补种。棉产区的关中渭南等六县，组织了百万农民，对七十多万亩棉田进行了移苗补苗，并在路边、渠边、畔角、地角等播种不到的地方进行了补种。种植水稻最多的陕南汉中专区，由于冷空气多次袭击，秧苗生长慢，这些地区的人民公社立即采取措施，分别浅灌、晒田，加施速效肥料，保证块块稻田苗全苗壮。
    今年陕西棉区蚜虫发生的面积比去年大。各产棉区对棉蚜虫都进行了突击围剿。鄠县从5月初到15日，全县组织了一千七百五十多个防虫突击队，全部药械齐出动，对有棉蚜的棉田都撒了六六六药粉。全省到5月25日止已防治了一百多万亩。结合防治棉蚜，全省并有二百多万亩棉田进行了中耕除草。
    据新华社讯　四川各地加强春播作物田间管理，促使苗齐苗全、健壮生长，力争高产丰收。
    今年四川省各项春播作物的播种面积都比往年扩大，而且播得早、播得好。各地在播种以后，立即进行大检查、大评比，并用去年田间管理不同、产量悬殊的事实教育社员，使广大群众进一步认识到“三分种，七分管”的重要意义。各级党组织并全面安排劳力，加强了春播作物田间管理的组织领导。夹江县各公社分作物组成田间管理专业队，普遍做到三天一次水，五天一次肥，晴天不干，雨天不淹。全县早稻、早玉米、红苕、棉花、花生等作物，都基本做到了无杂草、无病虫、无缺窝和无弱苗。万县专区为了管好早玉米，许多公社从社到队都有一名副书记和队长负责领导玉米生产。各地还普遍以管理区或生产队为单位，组成玉米田间管理专业队、组，推行定地段、定劳力、定时间、定质量等生产责任制度。
    在春播作物田间管理中，各级领导干部大搞指挥田，指导和推动大面积生产。南部县县委领导同志在南隆公社指挥田里发现土蚕、粘虫，就立即召开电话会议，突击治虫，及早消灭了虫害。现在，全县棉田已补齐缺窝，长得整齐健壮。
    各地针对去冬今春气温高，越冬害虫死亡少，因而今年大春害虫数量大、繁殖快、危害农作物的时间也提早的特点，及早加强病虫防治工作。新繁县各公社都以管理区为单位成立防治病虫害专业组，把全部早春作物喷了两三次农药，保证了作物正常生长。
