Xinhua News Agency, 18th. Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, spoke at the mass rally against U.S. imperialist aggression, saying: Eisenhower, this head of U.S. imperialism, the No. 1 war monger, actually came to Taiwan himself. A robber can't do anything good when he goes out. Everyone knows that his so-called trip to the Far East and his arrival in Taiwan are conspiracies to plan new wars of aggression and try to maintain his shaky hegemonic position in the Far East. I fully support the "Letter to the Military and Civilians of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu" issued by the Fujian Front Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the 17th. I think it is very necessary to use artillery fire as an armed demonstration to express the contempt of our great Chinese people for this robber chief.

Guo Moruo said that U.S. imperialism has occupied our sacred territory of Taiwan for ten years. For ten years, the American aggressors have been running amok in Taiwan, constantly carrying out military provocations against us, and attempting to create "two Chinas." The people of Taiwan have suffered oppression and humiliation under the iron heel of U.S. imperialism. We hate the crimes of U.S. imperialism and sympathize with the plight of the people of Taiwan. The banditry of U.S. imperialism on our territory is intolerable to every Chinese person. The people of Taiwan have also shown great anger. Their destruction of the so-called American Embassy three years ago is proof of this. Recently, in many places in Taiwan, there have been many slogans such as "Drive American soldiers out of Taiwan." American soldiers no longer dare to walk alone in remote places. The anti-American sentiment of the people of Taiwan is rising day by day.

Guo Moruo said that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of people of all countries and world peace. It does evil everywhere and acts arrogantly. On May 1, it sent a U-2 aircraft to invade the Soviet Union and sabotage the four-nation government summit, exposing its imperialist face time and time again. U.S. imperialism is full of evil deeds, and now it is being beaten everywhere. Although Eisenhower shows his greedy wolf head on the one hand, and wears a charming sheepskin on the other, the wolf head cannot scare people, and the sheepskin cannot deceive people. This robber chief, who has been coldly received in the Philippines, was so frightened by the roar of the Japanese people that he did not dare to go to Japan. The Korean people are also angrily preparing to drive him away. This plague god is unwelcome everywhere and has become a rat running across the street. The lackeys raised by U.S. imperialism are also collapsing one by one and will not end well. Although U.S. imperialism still wants to continue to support those unpopular lackeys of his, it is a clay Bodhisattva crossing the river, unable to save himself. U.S. imperialism itself is already panic-stricken, and its doomsday is not far off. Can his gang of accomplices like Nobusuke Kishi have a better way out than Syngman Rhee and Menderes?

Guo Moruo finally said that Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. We will never allow U.S. imperialism to occupy Taiwan, and we will never allow the creation of "two Chinas." The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan, and all patriotic compatriots must unite to drive U.S. imperialism out of Taiwan!

### 郭沫若在和大反对美国侵略集会上讲话  美帝国主义的末日不远了

    郭沫若在和大反对美国侵略集会上讲话
    美帝国主义的末日不远了
    新华社18日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若在和大反对美帝侵略的抗议集会上发表谈话说：艾森豪威尔，这个美帝国主义的头子、头号战争贩子，居然自己也到台湾来了。强盗出门做不出好事，他这次的所谓远东之行并且来到台湾，大家都知道，是阴谋策划新的侵略战争，想来维持他在远东摇摇欲坠的恶霸地位。我完全拥护中国人民解放军福建前线司令部在17日所发表的“告台、澎、金、马军民同胞书”，我认为，用打炮武装示威来表示我们伟大的中国人民对这个强盗头子的蔑视与鄙视，是很必要的。
    郭沫若说，美帝国主义霸占我国的神圣领土台湾已经十年了。十年来，美国侵略者在台湾胡作非为，还对我们不断进行军事挑衅，并且企图制造“两国中国”。台湾同胞在美帝国主义的铁蹄下，受尽了压迫和凌辱，我们痛恨美帝国主义的罪行，同情台湾同胞的遭遇。美帝国主义在我国领土上的强盗行为，是每一个中国人民所不能容忍的，台湾同胞也表现了极大的愤怒，三年前他们捣毁了所谓美国大使馆就是一个证明。近来，在台湾许多地方，不断出现“把美国大兵从台湾赶出去”等许多标语，美国兵已经不敢单独在偏僻地方行走了。台湾同胞的反美情绪正在一天天高涨。
    郭沫若说，美帝国主义是各国人民和世界和平的最凶恶的敌人。它到处为非作歹，横行霸道。5月1日，它派遣U—2型飞机侵犯苏联，破坏四国政府首脑会议，一次又一次暴露了它的帝国主义真面目。美帝国主义恶贯满盈，现在到处挨打。艾森豪威尔虽然一面伸着贪婪的狼头，一面披着迷人的羊皮，但是狼头吓不倒人，羊皮骗不了人。这个在菲律宾已经受到冷遇的强盗头子，在日本人民的怒吼下，吓得不敢去日本了。朝鲜人民也在愤怒地准备驱逐他。这个瘟神到处不受人们的欢迎，成为过街老鼠。美帝国主义所豢养的走狗，也在一个个垮台，不得好下场。美帝国主义虽然还想继续替他的那些不得人心的奴才们撑腰，但是，泥菩萨过河，自身难保，美帝国主义自身都已经是惶惶不可终日，末日不远了。它的那群狐群狗党岸信介之流难道还能有比李承晚和曼德列斯更好的出路吗？
    郭沫若最后说，台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分，我们绝不容许美帝国主义霸占台湾，绝不容许制造“两个中国”，中国人民一定要解放台湾，一切爱国同胞团结起来，把美帝国主义赶出台湾去！
