    Accumulate Farm Manure on a Large Scale; Manufacture Indigenous Fertilizer on a Large Scale
    Fujian and Jiangsu Mobilize the Masses to Seize the Opportunity to Accumulate Fertilizer and Topdress Quickly According to Local Conditions
    (Reported by our newspaper) A mass movement to accumulate large amounts of topdressing fertilizer for early rice is unfolding vigorously in various parts of Fujian Province.
    This year, the planting area of double-cropping early rice in Fujian Province has expanded by about 30% compared to last year. In order to win a comprehensive bumper harvest of early rice, after the transplanting was basically completed, various localities widely mobilized the masses to adopt a combination of specialized teams and mass shock tactics to accumulate and apply fast-acting fertilizers in large quantities. In Qingning County, where the early rice planting area has expanded two times compared to last year, the original third-class seedlings accounted for 21%. After applying a large amount of fast-acting fertilizer, not only were the third-class seedlings quickly eliminated, but also the first-class seedlings increased from the original 51% to 80%.
    In the large-scale accumulation and manufacturing of topdressing fertilizer, various localities implemented the policy of walking on two legs, both focusing on raising pigs to accumulate fertilizer and on the production of green manure. In a relatively short period of time, they accumulated and manufactured a large amount of farmyard manure, compost, indigenous fertilizer, ash fertilizer and other fast-acting fertilizers. Changtai, Zhouning, Jian'ou, Wuping and other counties established specialized teams for manufacturing indigenous fertilizer, using the locally abundant potassium, phosphorus, sulfur, nitrogen and other mineral fertilizer sources, and successively processed and manufactured more than twenty kinds of indigenous fertilizers and mixed fertilizers such as potassium nitrate, superphosphate, and lime nitrogen, totaling more than 2.5 million dan, averaging nearly 100 to several hundred jin of indigenous fertilizer that could be applied to each mu of early rice. Counties such as Fu'an, Minqing, Gutian, and Liancheng took pig farms and livestock farms as fertilizer production bases, strengthened bedding and cleaning, and rushed to accumulate a large amount of fast-acting manure and pen manure. The mountainous Nanping, Changting, Yongding and other counties and the coastal Lianjiang, Jinjiang and Zhangpu counties used the locally very abundant green manure, ash fertilizer and sea fertilizer resources, and in a short period of time accumulated more than 80 million dan of compost, ash fertilizer and sea fertilizer, averaging an increase of 30 to 40 dan to more than 100 dan of fast-acting fertilizer per mu.
    In carrying out the competition of large-scale accumulation, manufacturing and application of topdressing fertilizer, various localities universally reformed tools, saving a large amount of labor. In the accumulation and transportation of fertilizer, the counties in Nanping Prefecture, in addition to dispatching more than 30,000 vehicles (ships), also newly erected more than 900 kilometers of wooden tracks, bamboo slides and overhead cableways, increasing the efficiency of fertilizer transportation by two to three times to dozens of times. Longdou Brigade of Shibei Commune in Shaowu County also created new tools such as a "scissor-shaped green cutting device", a fertilizer gravity flow trough and a fertilizer application boat, making the tools for collecting, transporting and applying fertilizer a complete set, averaging an increase in work efficiency by three times. The entire brigade originally had 260 people engaged in fertilizer, and now only 56 people are needed to take charge.
    (Xinhua News Agency report) Jiangsu Province will launch a large-scale summer fertilizer production and accumulation movement after the summer harvest and planting to prepare sufficient fertilizer to ensure continued comprehensive and large-scale production increases of autumn-ripening crops.
    The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China called on the province to bring out the energy used in large-scale water conservancy construction to vigorously grasp fertilizer; and pointed out that: Developing pig raising, planting green manure, especially using all available water surfaces in the province to plant aquatic green manure, is the main measure to quickly solve the problem of high-efficiency refined fertilizer, and is the main way to solve the fertilizer problem in a more, faster, better and more economical way. On this basis, promote the advanced experience of applying heavy base fertilizer and skillfully applying topdressing fertilizer.
    To this end, Jiangsu has recently held several symposiums on fertilizer issues with the participation of some counties to exchange experiences in raising pigs to accumulate fertilizer and planting green manure on a large scale. According to the experience of Suining, Siyang, Qidong and Changshu counties, Jiangsu will plant green manure with high fertilizer efficiency, long fertilizer power, less labor and low cost in this summer and autumn, using all short-term fallow land and intercropping methods. The facts of the above four counties prove that: green manure can be planted in all seasons, planting green manure can cultivate soil fertility and improve the soil. Planting green manure can increase the yield of both grain and cotton. Therefore, this year, various parts of Jiangsu will take various measures such as intercropping green manure in cotton fields, increasing a season of green manure in late stubble fields, and intercropping spring corn and green manure to plant various green manure crops. In particular, in the Lianbei single-ripening wheat area, the land will be used for summer fallow planting of green manure after the wheat harvest this year, and efforts will be made to eliminate summer fallow land.
    Aquatic green manure will be planted on a large scale in the water network polder area of the province. There are many aquatic green manures in Jiangsu. According to a survey in Wujiang County, there are 380,000 mu of water surface. Last year, some water surfaces harvested more than 20 million dan of various aquatic green manures such as aquatic weeds, duckweed, winter sheep grass, water chestnut vines, wormwood, and gorgon fruit.
    In addition to developing green manure on a large scale, various parts of Jiangsu also pay great attention to raising pigs to accumulate fertilizer, and are promoting the experience of Binhai, Taizhou, Liyang and other counties in rapidly developing pig raising. Various localities also attach great importance to various ways of fertilizer production and accumulation such as cutting grass and composting green fertilizer in summer, making indigenous fertilizer and accumulating miscellaneous fertilizer, dredging river mud, smoking soil, digging sludge, and organizing urban manure to go to the countryside.

    大积农家肥　大造土化肥
    福建江苏发动群众抓紧时机因地制宜多积肥快追肥
    本报讯　一个为早稻积造大量追肥的群众运动正在福建省各地轰轰烈烈展开。
    今年，福建省双季早稻种植面积比去年扩大30％左右。为了夺取早稻全面丰收，各地在插秧基本结束后，广泛发动群众，采用专业队和群众性突击相结合的办法，大量积制和追施速效肥料。早稻种植面积比去年扩大两倍的清宁县，原来三类苗占21％，经过增施了大量速效性肥料以后，不仅迅速消灭了三类苗，而且使一类苗由原来的占51％增加到80％。
    各地在大积大制追肥中贯彻了两条腿走路的方针，既抓养猪积肥，又抓绿肥的生产，在较短的时间内就积制了大量厩肥、沤肥、土化肥、灰肥等速效性肥料。长泰、周宁、建瓯、武平等县建立了制造土化肥专业队，利用当地盛产的钾、磷、硫、氮等矿物质肥源，先后加工制造了硝酸钾、过磷酸钙、石灰氮等二十多种土化肥和混合肥料二百五十多万担，平均每亩早稻可追施土化肥近百斤到几百斤。福安、闽清、古田、连城等县以养猪场和畜牧场为肥料生产基地，加强垫栏和清厩等工作，赶积大量速效性粪肥和栏肥。多山的南平、长汀、永定等县和沿海的连江、晋江和漳浦各县，用当地非常丰富的绿肥、灰肥和海肥等资源，在短期中就积制了沤肥、灰肥和海肥等八千多万担，平均每亩能增施三、四十担到一百多担速效性肥料。
    在开展大积、大造和大施追肥竞赛中，各地普遍改革工具，节省了大批劳力。南平专区各县在积运肥料中，除了出动三万多辆（艘）车船外，还新架设了木轨道、竹滑道和架空索道等九百多公里，使运肥效率提高二、三倍到几十倍。邵武县水北公社龙斗大队还创造了“剪形割青器”、肥料自流槽和施肥船等新工具，使采、运、施工具配套成龙，平均提高工效达三倍，全大队原来二百六十人搞肥料，现在只需五十六个人就包下来了。
    据新华社讯　江苏全省将在夏收夏种后开展一个声势浩大的夏季造肥、积肥运动，为保证秋熟作物继续全面大增产准备充足的肥料。
    中共江苏省委会号召全省拿出大搞水利建设的劲头来大抓肥料；并指出：发展养猪，种植绿肥，特别是利用全省所有可利用的水面种植水生绿肥，是当前迅速解决高效精肥的主要措施，是多快好省地解决肥料问题的主要道路。在这个基础上，推广重施基肥和巧施追肥的先进经验。
    为此江苏最近连续召开了几次有部分县参加的肥料问题座谈会，交流了养猪积肥和大种绿肥的经验。根据睢宁、泗阳、启东、常熟四县的经验，江苏将在今年夏季和秋季，利用一切短期的休闲土地和利用套作间种办法，大种肥效高、肥力长、花工少、成本低的绿肥。上述四县的事实证明：绿肥一年四季能种，种植绿肥能培养地力，改良土壤。种绿肥后无论种粮食和棉花都能增产。为此，今年江苏各地将分别采取棉地套种绿肥、晚茬田增种一季绿肥、春玉米和绿肥间作等各种办法来种植各种绿肥作物。特别是联北一熟麦田地区，今年麦收后将利用土地夏季休闲种植绿肥，争取消灭夏季休闲田。
    全省水网圩区将大规模种植水生绿肥。江苏水生绿肥很多，据吴江县调查就有水面三十八万亩，去年部分水面就捞取了水草、水浮萍、冬羊草、菱藤、蒿草、芡实等各种水生绿肥二千多万担。
    除大规模发展绿肥外，江苏各地还很注意养猪积肥，正在推广滨海、泰州、溧阳等县的快速发展养猪的经验。各地对于夏季割草沤制青肥，造土化肥和积杂肥、罱河泥、熏土、挖污泥、组织城粪下乡等多种多样的造肥积肥道路也很重视。（附图片）
