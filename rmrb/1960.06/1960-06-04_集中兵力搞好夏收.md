Local Newspaper Commentary Excerpts:

    Concentrate Forces to Do a Good Job in Summer Harvesting
    On June 2nd, the Hebei Daily published an editorial entitled "Concentrate Forces to Do a Good Job in Summer Harvesting." The abstract is as follows: The production tasks during the summer harvest and planting season are very busy, and they are very time-sensitive. This requires arranging the farm work in order of priority. Arranging in order means a process of analysis and comparison, which enables us to distinguish between the primary and secondary, and the urgent and less urgent, thereby rationally arranging labor to ensure the comprehensive and timely completion of the summer harvest and planting. Arranging farm work in order should clarify that the summer harvest is the most urgent task at this stage and must be completed on time, with quality, and in quantity. All other farm work should be centered around the summer harvest and should not compete with the summer harvest for labor. Only by clarifying this point can we make scientific arrangements for the labor required for other farm work. For example, drought resistance to protect seedlings and drought-resistant planting are also very time-sensitive tasks, but they can be arranged in advance. Before the summer harvest, organize campaigns to carry out shock work on the final stages of drought-resistant planting of spring-sown crops, intercropping summer-sown crops in wheat fields, and carry out shock drought resistance to protect seedlings. In this way, both the strong time sensitivity of these farm tasks is adapted to, and the farm work during the summer harvest is rationally arranged, ensuring that the main forces are concentrated to fight an annihilation war.
    The fundamental guarantee for scientifically allocating labor is to strengthen the leadership of the Party and launch a large-scale mass movement. The masses have accumulated rich experience in production practice, and they continue to accumulate rich experience. As long as the masses are mobilized and the wisdom of the masses is concentrated, thousands of brilliant ideas can be put forward. Sometimes, some experiences may seem like small points, but thousands of small points of experience can be combined into an ocean of wisdom, which surpasses the wisdom of any individual. Xinle County took this path, matching bits and pieces of experience into a complete set, and formed ten methods for allocating labor. This is a powerful proof. Allocating labor is also a specific arrangement of the actions of the masses, which requires a high degree of awareness and enthusiasm from the masses to ensure that it is implemented well. Therefore, in the summer harvest and planting, the leadership of the Party must be further strengthened. Party secretaries at all levels should go deep into the masses, mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and launch a large-scale mass movement.

### 集中兵力搞好夏收

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    集中兵力搞好夏收
    6月2日，河北日报以“集中兵力搞好夏收”为题发表社论。摘要如下：夏收夏种期间的生产任务十分繁忙，而且时间性很强。这就需要进行农活排队。排队，这就是分析、比较的过程，可以使我们分清主次和轻重缓急，从而合理地来安排劳力，保证夏收夏种全面适时完成进行农活排队，应当明确夏收是这一阶段最紧张的任务，必须按时、按质、按量完成，其他一切农活都应当围绕夏收进行，不能与夏收争劳力。明确了这一点，才能对其他农活所需要的劳力进行科学的安排。例如抗旱保苗和抗旱播种，这也是时间性很强的任务，但是它可以提前进行安排，要在夏收以前，组织战役，突击春播作物的抗旱播种的扫尾工作，在麦田套种夏播作物，突击抗旱保苗。这样，既适应了这些农活的强烈时间性，又合理安排了夏收期间的农活，保证集中主要力量打歼灭战。
    科学支配劳动力的根本保证，是加强党的领导，大搞群众运动。群众在生产实践中，积累了丰富的经验，而且继续积累着丰富的经验，只要把群众发动起来，把群众的智慧集中起来，就可以提出千条万条妙计。有时，看来一些经验是点滴的，但是千万条点滴的经验，就可以汇集为智慧的海洋，他超过任何个人的智慧。新乐县走这条道路，把点滴经验配套成龙，就形成了支配劳力的十项办法，这是有力的证明。支配劳力又是具体安排群众的行动，更需要有群众高度的自觉性和积极性，才能保证推行得好。因此，在夏收夏种中，必须进一步加强党的领导，各级书记应当深入到群众中去，发动群众，依靠群众，大搞群众运动。
