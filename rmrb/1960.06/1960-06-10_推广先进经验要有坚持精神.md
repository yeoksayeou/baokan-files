    Promoting Advanced Experiences Requires Perseverance

    Under the leadership of the factory Party committee and the workshop Party branch, our team promoted the semi-automatic doffing machine. Comrades happily said, "We have been liberated for the second time!"

    When we started using the semi-automatic doffing machine, everyone excitedly said, "We never thought that doffing would also use machines." "With the doffing machine, our production can be even faster!" However, after only two days, some comrades were unwilling to use it anymore. Why? Apart from some shortcomings in the doffing machine itself at the time, the main reason was that the operating techniques had not kept up. Therefore, it was not easy to get used to using it, it was very laborious, the speed was not fast, there were many thread breaks, the downtime was long, and the output not only did not increase, but decreased instead. After the Party branch learned about this situation, it promptly held a meeting in our team to organize everyone to recall the experience of adhering to high speed and high output in 1958. At that time, it was the same; after speeding up the machine, the output did not increase accordingly because the measures had not kept up. At that time, some comrades had also wavered, but later they finally achieved victory in high speed and high output.

    Through the review, the comrades realized that any new thing cannot be perfect from the beginning; only by persisting in using it can it go from incomplete to complete, and only in practice can it be continuously improved and enhanced. With ideological understanding, confidence has also increased. Everyone said: We must persist in using it to the end and strive for a double harvest in production and innovation.

    After the comrades worked hard to learn and adopted the "talk (every day after work, the team holds a meeting to exchange experiences and problems), watch (according to the problems raised by everyone, go to the machine to do slow-motion demonstrations, observe each other, and find the reasons), discuss (jointly study solutions), try (actually experiment on the machine), compete (improve operational proficiency through competitions)" "five-character method," they finally overcame the difficulties, mastered the new technology, consolidated and improved the results of technological innovation, and made it a huge driving force for the development of production.

### 推广先进经验要有坚持精神

    推广先进经验要有坚持精神
    在厂党委和车间党支部的领导下，我们小组推广了半自动落纱机。同志们高兴地说：“我们又得到了第二次解放！”
    我们开始使用半自动落纱机的时候，大家都兴高彩烈地说：“想不到落纱也用上机器了。”“用上落纱机，我们的生产更能高速度了。”可是，仅仅两天，有的同志就不愿意再用它了。为什么呢？除了当时落纱机本身还有些缺点，主要是因为操作技术没有跟上去。因此，使用起来不习惯，很费力气，速度不快，断头多，停台时间长，产量不仅没有提高，反而下降了。党支部了解到这一情况以后，及时在我们小组里召开了会议，组织大家回忆1958年坚持高速高产的经验。那时候，也是这样，加快车速以后，由于措施没有跟上去，产量并没有相应地提高。当时，有的同志也曾动摇过，可是后来终于取得了高速高产的胜利。
    通过回忆，同志们认识到：任何新生事物，不可能一开始就十全十美，只有坚持使用下去，才能从不完整到完整，才能在实践中不断地改进和提高。思想通了，信心也就增强了。大家表示：一定要坚持使用到底，争取生产、革新双丰收。
    经过同志们勤学苦练和采用“谈（每天下班后，小组开会交流经验和问题）、看（根据大家提出的问题，到车上去做慢动作表演，相互观察，找原因）、议（共同研究解决办法）、试（到车上实际试验）、赛（通过竞赛提高操作熟练程度）”“五字法”以后，终于战胜困难，掌握了新技术，巩固和提高了技术革新成果，使它成为发展生产的巨大动力。
