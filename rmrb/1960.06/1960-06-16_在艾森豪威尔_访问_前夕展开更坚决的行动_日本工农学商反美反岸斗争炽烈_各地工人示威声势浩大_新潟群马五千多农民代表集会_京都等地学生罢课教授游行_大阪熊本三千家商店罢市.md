Xinhua News Agency, 15th Dispatch: Tokyo News: A massive parade composed of 15,000 Japanese workers departed from Hibiya Park at 11:00 this morning, forming 18 columns and proceeding mightily towards the National Diet Building. This was the vanguard of today's 100,000-strong mass demonstration in Tokyo against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, demanding the resignation of Nobusuke Kishi, and opposing Eisenhower's "visit" to Japan.

This contingent, composed of transportation workers, teachers, and government employees who had taken leave or left their jobs to participate in the demonstration, first proceeded to the National Diet Building and Kishi Nobusuke's official residence, and then marched in front of the U.S. Embassy. The marching crowd also distributed tens of thousands of leaflets to passersby, calling on them to join the struggle to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" and to oppose the U.S. President's visit to Japan.

Prior to this, all the demonstrators held a meeting. At the meeting, Hirozo Minaguchi, Secretary-General of the "National Council to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty," Seiichi Katsumada, Director of the Education and Propaganda Bureau of the Socialist Party, and Ushitaro Okamoto, Chairman of the Tokyo Metropolitan Trade Union Council, spoke.

Minaguchi Hirozo pointed out that Eisenhower's "visit" to the Far East and Japan this time is clearly aimed at strengthening the Northeast Asian military alliance mechanism and propping up the tottering Kishi Nobusuke government. This is interference in Japan's internal affairs and will also exacerbate the tense situation in Asia.

Minaguchi demanded that all participants fight to the end to force the cancellation of Eisenhower's "visit" to Japan.

Katsumada emphasized the important tasks of the organized workers at this critical moment. He said that as long as the organized workers strengthen their unity and resolutely launch struggles, final victory belongs to the people.

Okamoto Ushitaro said that since the "Security Treaty" is the root of the Japanese people's suffering, it is the inherent right of the working class to strike against it.

Okamoto called on workers to unite and, when Eisenhower comes to Japan despite the opposition of the Japanese people, to express their firm opposition to the war policy of U.S. imperialism with action.

Xinhua News Agency, 15th Dispatch: Tokyo News: Workers and people from all walks of life across Japan held powerful demonstrations centered on general strikes, resolutely opposing the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, opposing Eisenhower's "visit" to Japan, demanding the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke government, and demanding the immediate dissolution of the Diet.

In Osaka Prefecture, 400,000 workers participated in the second nationwide general strike, the largest number of strikers in the Osaka area since the launch of the struggle against the "Security Treaty."

Civil servants and private enterprise workers held workplace meetings and half-day or scheduled strikes.

Two thousand stores of the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry Federation held strikes ranging from one hour to half a day. In the afternoon, 1,700 store owners also took to the streets by car for demonstrations and protested at the tax office.

In Osaka City, 130,000 workers and citizens held rallies in five locations to protest against the Kishi Nobusuke government and the U.S. government. After the meeting, they marched to Nakanoshima Park in the center of Osaka. Professors from various universities in Osaka participated in the parade, holding high signs reading "Down with the Kishi Cabinet!" and "Smash the Security Treaty!" The entire cast of the "Bugei" theater troupe, which is currently performing in Osaka, and cultural figures from Osaka also participated in the parade. The signs they held read: "Oppose Eisenhower's Visit to Japan!" Textile workers and 5,000 middle school students also participated in the parade.

In Kyoto City, 20,000 workers and citizens held rallies in eight locations. Students from Kyoto University, Doshisha University, and Ritsumeikan University went on strike and held student rallies respectively. They then gathered at Maruyama Park for a grand Kyoto All-Student General Uprising Conference attended by 8,000 students. After the conference, all participants marched on the streets. In addition, more than 600 professors and associate professors from Kyoto University held a conference in the afternoon. Hiroshi Suekawa, President of Ritsumeikan University, and Kakuichi Oshita, President of Doshisha University, spoke at the meeting. After the meeting, the professors marched on the streets.

More than 70,000 people in Kobe held rallies in eight locations today and held demonstrations in the city.

Workers in all sectors in the Kyushu region joined the struggle today. 85,000 coal miners simultaneously launched a 24-hour strike. The Locomotive Engineers' Union and the National Railway Workers' Union held a two-hour workplace meeting at the Kashiire train depot starting at 8:30 a.m., causing 30 trains, including special express trains, to be suspended for two hours. In Omuta, railway workers, with the support of workers from the Miike Coal Mine, held a two-hour workplace meeting, causing four passenger trains and many freight trains to be delayed.

In Hiroshima, 110,000 workers held strikes and gatherings in 1,200 workplaces. This is the largest number of strikers in Hiroshima City.

High school students from five schools in Kochi Prefecture went on strike, unanimously expressing their opposition to the new "Security Treaty." 16,000 middle school students in the prefecture participated in local protest rallies.

In Hokkaido, at the northern tip of Japan, railway workers' strikes have paralyzed traffic.

Xinhua News Agency, 15th Dispatch: Tokyo News: According to today's report in the Japanese "Akahata" (Red Flag) newspaper, 2,000 farmer representatives in Niigata Prefecture passed a resolution at a conference held in Niitsu City on the 12th, opposing Eisenhower's "visit" to Japan.

The resolution declared that the Diet's vote on the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" was invalid, and demanded that Kishi Nobusuke step down immediately and dissolve the Diet.

The resolution also demanded higher rice purchase prices and opposed trade "liberalization."

The conference decided to send 300 farmer representatives to Tokyo on the 18th and 19th to participate in central unified actions.

After the meeting, farmer representatives held a demonstration march on the streets, holding high signs.

On the 13th, 3,500 farmer representatives in Gunma Prefecture held conferences in 22 locations, demanding the dissolution of the Diet, the overthrow of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, the prevention of the ratification of the new "Security Treaty," and opposition to Eisenhower's "visit" to Japan.
