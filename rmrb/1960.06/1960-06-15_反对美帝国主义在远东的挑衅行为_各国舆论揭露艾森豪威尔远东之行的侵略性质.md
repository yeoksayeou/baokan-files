Xinhua News Agency report: International public opinion continues to comment on Eisenhower's trip to the Far East.

    **Vietnam's "People's Daily" says**

    **The Aggressive Nature of U.S. Imperialism Has Been Seen Through**

    Vietnam's "People's Daily" published a commentary on the 14th, pointing out that Eisenhower's activities in the Philippines, Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea aim to promote the realization of U.S. imperialism's plan to prepare for war against the Soviet Union, China, and other Asian countries, and to support the reactionary authorities in these places so that they can continue their traitorous and harmful activities.

    The commentary said: "Eisenhower's statement that the alliance between the United States and the authorities in the four places he is about to visit is 'of vital importance to the United States' precisely admits the dark and extremely dangerous purpose of his visit."

    The commentary refuted Eisenhower's deceptive talk about having many friends in those places, saying that only a small group of people who kowtow to the United States are friends of the United States. "On June 11 alone, two million people in Japan marched, demanding 'Hagerty get out!' and 'Eisenhower don't come!'"

    The commentary said: "The reason why the Japanese people and other peoples are increasingly resolutely opposing the United States is because they have seen through the aggressive and bellicose truth of U.S. imperialism."

    **Indonesia's "People's Daily" says**

    **The U.S. Policy of Being Keen on Military Treaties is Increasingly Bankrupt**

    Indonesia's "People's Daily" published a commentary on the 14th on Eisenhower's trip to Asia, saying that the actions of Asian people resisting American rule will be even more intense.

    The commentary said that Eisenhower's "visit" will arouse great indignation among the Asian people against the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and other aggressive military treaties and colonial rule.

    The newspaper said that the supporters of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization who created riots in Indonesia cannot escape the punishment of the Indonesian people.

    The newspaper pointed out that Eisenhower, disregarding the opposition of the people in the regions he is going to, still risks going to those places. The Asian people will see more clearly that the system and policy of aggressive military treaties that the United States is keen on are increasingly bankrupt.

    The newspaper also said that the Asian people's attitude towards Eisenhower's trip to Asia will provide important experiences and lessons for the Indonesian people and the people of other Southeast Asian countries on how to deal with and oppose the interference and aggression of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

    The newspaper also published an editorial supporting the struggle of the Japanese people. The editorial said that if Eisenhower insists on going to Japan, he will personally witness the funeral of the Kishi Nobusuke government and the prestige of the United States.

    The editorial said that the Japanese people are now indeed speaking in their own language, which is the language of demonstration, revolution, and insubordination.

    **Cuba's "Revolución" says**

    **Eisenhower's Trip Will Open the Eyes of Many People**

    Cuba's "Revolución" published a commentary on the 13th, saying that Eisenhower's trip to Japan is a Pentagon-planned attempt to once again impose the signing of the so-called Japan-U.S. "Security" Treaty on the Japanese people, regardless of their opposition.

    The newspaper pointed out that Eisenhower is actually a tool in the hands of the largest interest groups that rule the United States, and the result of his visit to Japan is not difficult to predict: it will be "new jokes, new failures, and new lessons." "Revolución" said that just as "Eisenhower's visit to Latin America opened the eyes of many people, (his) trip to Japan will undoubtedly be equally educational." The commentary said, "The people of all countries will finally see what is hidden behind the great myth of this twentieth century - the myth of the great 'American democracy'."

    **Czechoslovakia's "Svobodné Slovo" says**

    **The People's Struggle Intensifies Wherever Eisenhower Goes**

    Czechoslovakia's "Svobodné Slovo" published a commentary on the 11th, saying: In the Far Eastern countries and regions that Eisenhower is about to visit, the struggle of the people against the abhorrent pro-American regimes is intensifying. In this situation, the U.S. President's trip to the Far East is an attempt by the United States to preserve what it can preserve in the role of a gendarme.

    The commentary said that the United States regards Japan as the main link in the Far East's "anti-communist front." Therefore, although Eisenhower cannot expect this to be a pleasant visit, he still does not cancel his visit.

    The commentary continued, in another "bastion" of the "free world" - South Korea, Eisenhower will no longer see his "good friend" Syngman Rhee, but will encounter the opposition of the South Korean people, who have not relaxed their struggle after overthrowing Syngman Rhee.

    The newspaper said that the U.S. ruling groups are doing everything possible to help the followers of their Far Eastern aggression policy escape disaster, but this will certainly not help improve the current situation, but is only another manifestation of the deep crisis of American foreign policy.

    **Bulgarian and Polish Newspapers Say**

    **Eisenhower's Visit is a Despicable Step by the United States**

    Bulgaria's "Rabotnichesko Delo" published an article on the 13th, saying that the most important item on Eisenhower's Far East trip is his visit to Japan. The purpose of his visit to Japan is to try to consolidate the Kishi Nobusuke government, which is already in a serious state, and to curb the powerful mass movement of the Japanese people against the United States.

    The article went on to point out that Eisenhower's visit to Japan is a despicable step in American foreign policy. The Japanese Communist Party, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and many other social organizations in Japan, uniting tens of millions of people, fiercely oppose Eisenhower's visit and the U.S.-Japan military treaty. The entire Japanese people are fighting for democracy and peace with unprecedented determination and will.

    Poland's "Trybuna Ludu" and "Sztandar Młodych" published commentaries on Eisenhower's trip to the Far East on the 13th.

    "Trybuna Ludu" said that the unpleasant days Eisenhower is experiencing today are probably not experienced by any former U.S. president. Washington's adventurous policy of sabotaging the Paris summit has exposed itself everywhere. At the same time, America's "darling" Syngman Rhee has stepped down, and then another pillar of the "free world" - Turkish Prime Minister Menderes - has been overthrown, and the pillar of the United States in Japan - Kishi Nobusuke - also feels unsafe. Now Eisenhower is visiting Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines, facing unusual difficulties.

    The newspaper wrote that the Japanese people saw very clearly from the U.S. spy plane incident that the U.S. military treaty harbors the danger of dragging Japan into war.

    Poland's "Sztandar Młodych," referring to the military bases established by the United States on Japanese territory, said that these bases are used against the Soviet Union and China. The commentary pointed out that the Soviet Union has warned that bases used by the United States for aggression will be punished as they deserve.

    **Pakistan's "Construction" Monthly Says**

    **The United States is a Notorious and Brutal Criminal**

    The latest issue of Pakistan's "Construction" monthly published an editorial exposing Eisenhower's warmongering face, saying that Eisenhower himself, who prays for world peace in sacred churches, is leading a conspiracy against peace.

    The editorial strongly condemned the U.S. spy plane's violation of Soviet airspace. It pointed out that those who dare to send spy planes to Russia are the greatest enemies of mankind, and no worse criminals have appeared in history.

    The editorial pointed out that the attitude of the U.S. warmongers shows that they are not ashamed of their stupidity, shamelessness, and their provocative behavior. It said, "The United States stands before the court of history as a notorious and brutal criminal."

    反对美帝国主义在远东的挑衅行为
    各国舆论揭露艾森豪威尔远东之行的侵略性质
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：各国舆论继续评论艾森豪威尔的远东之行。
    越南“人民报”说
    美帝国主义的侵略本性已被看透
    越南“人民报”14日发表评论指出：艾森豪威尔到菲律宾、日本、台湾和南朝鲜活动的目的，在于促进实现美帝国主义准备战争来反对苏联、中国和亚洲其他国家的计划，扶植这些地方的反动当局，使它们继续进行卖国殃民的活动。
    评论说：“艾森豪威尔说，美国同他即将访问的四个地方的当局的联盟‘对美国具有生死存亡的价值’的这番话，恰恰供认了他这次访问的黑暗和其极危险的目的。”
    评论驳斥了艾森豪威尔所吹嘘的他在那些地方有许多朋友的欺人之谈，评论说，只有向美国屈膝的一小撮人是美国的朋友。“仅在6月11日一天，日本就有两百万人游行，要求‘哈格蒂滚出去’、‘艾森豪威尔不要来’！”
    评论说：“日本人民和其他地方人民所以越来越坚决地反对美国，就是因为他们看透了美帝国主义的侵略和好战的真相。”
    印度尼西亚“人民日报”说
    美国热中军事条约的政策日益破产
    印度尼西亚“人民日报”14日就艾森豪威尔的亚洲之行发表评论说，亚洲人民反抗美国统治的行动将更加猛烈。
    评论说，艾森豪威尔的“访问”将激起亚洲人民对东南亚条约组织以及其它侵略性军事条约和殖民统治的极大愤慨。
    这家报纸说，在印度尼西亚制造骚乱的东南亚条约组织的支持者无法逃避印度尼西亚人民的惩罚。
    这家报纸指出，艾森豪威尔不顾他将去的地区的人民的反对，还是要冒险到那些地方去。亚洲人民将更清楚地看到：美国所热衷的侵略性军事条约的体系和政策正在日益破产。
    这家报纸又说，亚洲人民对待艾森豪威尔的亚洲之行的态度，将向印度尼西亚人民和其它东南亚国家的人民提供重要的经验和教训，以便怎样去对付和反对东南亚条约组织的干涉和侵略。
    这家报纸还发表社论，支持日本人民的斗争。社论说，如果艾森豪威尔硬要到日本去，他将亲眼看到岸信介政府以及美国威望的葬礼。
    社论说，日本人民现在的确是在用自己的语言讲话，这是示威、革命和不屈服的语言。
    古巴“革命报”说
    艾森豪威尔此行将使许多人擦亮眼睛
    古巴“革命报”13日发表评论说，艾森豪威尔的日本之行是五角大楼所策划的、再一次企图把所谓的日美“安全”条约的签字强加给日本人民，而不顾日本人民的反对。
    这家报纸指出，艾森豪威尔实际上是统治着美国的最大利益集团手中的工具，他这次访问日本的结果是不难预测的：它将是“新的笑柄，新的失败和新的教训”。“革命报”说，正像“艾森豪威尔对拉丁美洲的访问使许多人擦亮了眼睛一样，（他的）日本之行无疑将是同样有教育意义的”。评论说，“世界各国人民终于会看到，在这个二十世纪的伟大神话——伟大的‘美国民主’的神话后边，究竟隐藏着什么货色。”
    捷克斯洛伐克“自由言论报”说
    艾森豪威尔所到之处人民斗争日益加强
    捷克斯洛伐克“自由言论报”11日发表评论说：艾森豪威尔所要访问的远东国家和地区中，人民反对令人痛恨的亲美政权的斗争，正日益加强，在这种情况下，美国总统的远东之行，是美国试图以宪兵的角色来保全它能保全的东西。
    评论说，美国把日本看作是远东“反共阵线”的主要环节，因此，艾森豪威尔虽然不能期望这是一次愉快的访问，他还是不取消他的访问。
    评论接着说，在“自由世界”的另一个“堡垒”——南朝鲜，艾森豪威尔将不会再看到他的“好朋友”李承晚，而将遭遇南朝鲜人民的反对，他们在推翻李承晚之后，并没有放松斗争。
    报纸说，美国统治集团千方百计地使他们的远东侵略方针的追随者逃避灾祸，但这肯定不会有助于改善目前的局势，而只是美国外交政策的深重危机的另一个迹象的表现。
    保加利亚和波兰报纸说
    艾森豪威尔访问是美国的卑鄙步骤
    保加利亚“工人事业报”13日发表文章说，艾森豪威尔远东之行的最重要日程是对日本的访问。他访问日本的目的是企图巩固已经陷于严重状态的岸信介政府和阻遏日本人民反对美国的强大的群众运动。
    文章接着指出，艾森豪威尔到日本的这次访问，是美国对外政策的一个卑鄙步骤。团结着数千万群众的日本共产党、工会总评议会和日本其他许多社会组织激烈反对艾森豪威尔的访问和日美军事条约。全日本人民正以前所未有的决心和意志为民主及和平而进行着斗争。
    波兰“人民论坛报”和“青年旗帜报”13日就艾森豪威尔远东之行发表了评论。
    “人民论坛报”说，艾森豪威尔今天经受的不好过的日子，大概是任何前任美国总统所不曾经历过的。破坏了巴黎首脑会议的华盛顿的冒险政策到处暴露了自己。与此同时，美国的“宠儿”李承晚下台了，紧接着，“自由世界”的另一支柱——土耳其总理曼德列斯被推翻了，美国在日本的支柱——岸信介也感觉不安全。现在艾森豪威尔到日本、南朝鲜、菲律宾访问，面临着不平常的困难。
    这家报纸写道，日本人民从美国间谍飞机事件完全看得很清楚，美国的军事条约孕育着把日本拉入战争的危险性。
    波兰“青年旗帜报”在谈到美国在日本领土上建立的军事基地时说，这些基地是用来反对苏联和中国的。评论指出，苏联已经警告过，被美国用来进行侵略活动的基地将受到应得的惩罚。
    巴基斯坦“建设”月刊说
    美国是一个罪恶昭彰的残暴的罪犯
    最近一期的巴基斯坦“建设”月刊发表社论揭露艾森豪威尔的好战面目时说，就是在神圣的教堂中祷告世界和平的艾森豪威尔本人正在领导反对和平的阴谋。
    社论强烈谴责美国间谍飞机侵犯苏联的领空的行为。它指出，那些敢于向俄国派出间谍飞机的人是人类最大的敌人，历史上还没有出现比他们更坏的罪犯。
    社论指出，美国好战分子的态度表明，他们不以他们的愚蠢、无耻和他们的挑衅行为感到羞耻。它说，“美国是以一个罪恶昭彰的、残暴的罪犯站在历史的法庭上”。
