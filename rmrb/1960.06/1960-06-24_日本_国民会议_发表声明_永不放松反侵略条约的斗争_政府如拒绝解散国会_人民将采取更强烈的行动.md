Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 23rd: The National Conference to Prevent Revision of the "Security Treaty" issued a statement today saying, "We are extremely angered to hear that the government has secretly exchanged instruments of ratification for the new security treaty with the United States today."

The statement pointed out that the Nobusuke Kishi group "has taken a series of impermissible, absurd, and extremely bizarre procedures" to complete the "ratification" process. The statement said, "We once again declare that the Japanese people refuse to have this treaty 'take effect' in complete disregard of the people's will for independence and autonomy."

The statement said, "Although Nobusuke Kishi has announced his intention to resign, he is mocking the people if he thinks that simply making such a resignation statement can appease them."

The statement said, "We believe that not only should Nobusuke Kishi himself bear the responsibility for forcibly passing the new 'Security Treaty,' but also all those reactionary politicians who actively promoted the conclusion of this aggressive treaty should bear this responsibility."

The statement said, "We will never relax the struggle until the Security Treaty is declared illegal, the Diet is dissolved, and the reactionary initiators of this treaty are expelled from the political arena."

The statement pointed out that the Supreme Court's understanding of the new "Security Treaty" only represents the views of a small handful of the Japanese ruling class. According to this interpretation, the new "Security Treaty" is said to be unrestrained by the Japanese Constitution, even if it has obvious characteristics that violate the Constitution. This interpretation of the "Security Treaty" by the Supreme Court reflects the ruling class's conspiracy to establish a dictatorial regime in Japan based on the new "Security Treaty."

The statement said that the only weapon that can guarantee not to suffer the destruction of this conspiracy is the resistance of the Japanese people. Currently, dissolving the Diet and holding general elections is a way for the people to express their will to resist the rulers' intention to establish a dictatorial regime. If the Japanese government refuses to dissolve the Diet, the Japanese people's dissatisfaction will erupt into actions that are stronger than ever before.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 23rd: Secretary-General Hirozo Mizuguchi of the National Conference to Prevent Revision of the "Security Treaty" said today: "Despite Nobusuke Kishi's resignation, the movement against the new Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty' will not change."

Mizuguchi said: "The National Conference" does not recognize the new "Security Treaty," and the movement against the "Security Treaty" will continue in the future.

Mizuguchi said that since the Nobusuke Kishi group forcibly voted on the new "Security Treaty" in the House of Representatives on May 19, its approach has been to disregard the fierce protests of the people, avoid the people's sight, and attempt to rely on this treaty to implement dictatorial politics.

Mizuguchi made these remarks after the "National Conference" held an emergency meeting today to decide on future struggle strategies.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 23rd: The Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs issued a statement today declaring that it will never recognize the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" as valid.

The statement emphasized that the new "Security Treaty" will realize Japan's nuclear armament, allow the United States to transport nuclear weapons into Japan, and stifle democracy. Therefore, the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs opposes this treaty.

The statement emphasized that since the Nobusuke Kishi group hastily "passed" the new "Security Treaty" in the House of Representatives on the morning of May 20, the Japanese people have shown their great strength in opposing this aggressive treaty. The Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs will draw strength from this magnificent movement against the "Security Treaty" and make the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, scheduled for August, a great success.
Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 23rd: The Japan International Trade Promotion Association issued a statement today declaring that the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," which the Kishi government used undemocratic methods to "establish," is invalid, and demanded that the Kishi Cabinet step down immediately.

    日本“国民会议”发表声明
    永不放松反侵略条约的斗争
    政府如拒绝解散国会　人民将采取更强烈的行动
    新华社23日讯　东京消息：阻止修改“安全条约”国民会议今天发表声明说，“听到政府今天已同美国偷偷地交换了新安全条约批准书的消息，我们感到十分激怒”。
    声明指出，岸信介集团“采取了一系列不能容许的荒谬绝伦和非常离奇的程序”来完成“批准”手续。声明说，“我们再一次宣布，日本人民拒绝在完全漠视人民独立自主的意志情况下‘生效’的这项条约。”
    声明说，“虽然岸信介宣布了他辞职的意图，但是如果他认为只要发表这样的辞职声明就能安慰人民，那等于是嘲弄人民。”
    声明说，“我们认为，不仅岸信介本人应当承担强行通过新‘安全条约’的责任，而且所有那些积极促使缔结这项侵略条约的反动政客，也应当承担这方面的责任。”
    声明说，“我们将永远不放松斗争，直到安全条约被宣布为非法，国会被解散和这个条约的反动的发起人被逐出政界为止。”
    声明指出，最高裁判所对新“安全条约”的理解，只代表一小撮日本统治阶级的意见。按照这种解释，据说新“安全条约”不受日本宪法的约束，即便它具有明显的违反宪法的性质。最高裁判所对于
  “安全条约”的这种解释，反映出统治阶级企图根据新“安全条约”在日本建立专制政权的阴谋。
    声明说，能够保证不遭受这种阴谋破坏的唯一武器是日本人民的反抗。目前，解散国会和举行大选，是人民应当借以表示其意志来反抗统治者建立专制政权的意图的一个途径。如果日本政府拒绝解散国会，日本人民的不满将爆发成为比过去任何时候更加强烈的行动。
    据新华社23日讯　东京消息：阻止修改“安全条约”国民会议事务局长水口宏三今天说：“尽管岸信介辞职，反对新日美“安全条约”的运动不会改变。
    水口说：“国民会议”不承认新“安全条约”，反对“安全条约”的运动今后还要继续进行。
    水口说，自从岸信介集团5月19日在众议院单独强行表决新“安全条约”以来，它所采取的办法是无视国民的激烈抗议和躲避国民的视线，并且企图依靠这项条约来实行独裁政治。
    水口是在“国民会议”今天召开紧急会议决定今后斗争方针之后，发表这番谈话的。
    新华社23日讯　东京消息：日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会今天发表声明宣布，它决不承认新日美“安全条约”是有效的。
    声明强调说，新“安全条约”将实现日本的核武装，由美国把核武器运进日本和扼杀民主，因此日
  本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会反对这个条约。
    声明强调说，自从5月20日清晨（岸信介集团）匆匆在众议院
  “通过”新“安全条约”以来，日本人民一直显示出他们反对这项侵略性条约的巨大力量。日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会将从这个波澜壮阔的反对“安全条约”的运动中吸取力量，并且使预定在8月份举行的第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会取得伟大的胜利。据新华社23日讯　东京消息：日本国际贸易促进协会今天发表声明，宣布岸信介政府用不民主方法使之“成立”的新日美“安全条约”无效，并且要求岸内阁立即下台。
