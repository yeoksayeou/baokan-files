Contemporary Hero
    Aizizihan (Tajik ethnicity), a model postman and Communist Party member from the Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County in Xinjiang, has been trekking across the Pamir Plateau for six years as a postman, regardless of ice, snow, or scorching sun. He does everything possible to deliver the mail to the masses quickly, and also often takes time to read the newspaper to the masses and write letters for them. Because he diligently serves the people, he is loved by people of all ethnic groups.

    当代英雄
    新疆塔什库尔干塔吉克自治县模范邮递员、共产党员艾再孜汗（塔吉克族）从担任邮递员以来，不论冰天雪地还是烈日炎炎，六年如一日地奔走在帕米尔高原上，想尽办法把邮件迅速地送到群众手里，并且还经常抽空给群众读报和代群众写信。由于他勤勤恳恳地为人民服务，所以受到各族人民的热爱。
