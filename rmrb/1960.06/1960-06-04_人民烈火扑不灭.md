    The people's烈火Cannot Be Extinguished
    Cheng Li
    Imperialism and its running dog reactionaries, faced with the raging revolutionary flames, have dispatched troops, horses, police batons, water cannons, tear gas, rifles, tanks, airplanes, artillery, and other weapons. They have exhausted all kinds of intimidation, threats, divisions, bribery, deception, and other tricks in an attempt to extinguish these revolutionary flames. But all this is in vain. The people cannot be intimidated, and the revolutionary flames cannot be extinguished. In South Korea, U.S. imperialism dispatched police and tanks, and issued deceptive statements, threatening and deceiving the masses, but it did not save Syngman Rhee from collapsing and meeting his doom. In Cuba, U.S. imperialism dispatched airplanes, bought off special agents, and carried out threats, but the Cuban people's revolutionary struggle has become increasingly resolute. France in Algeria, Belgium in the Congo, and Britain in Northern Rhodesia have used all kinds of repressive weapons and exhausted all means of intimidation, but the result is that the anti-colonialist struggle flames are burning ever more vigorously. Nobusuke Kishi has also exhausted all means of threat and deception, but the masses in the struggle have grown from hundreds of thousands to millions to tens of millions, surging mightily onto the streets of Tokyo, towards the Diet, and towards Nobusuke Kishi's official residence.
    The people's revolutionary flames can never be extinguished. As long as imperialism is not finished, the flames of the people of the world against imperialism will burn ever more vigorously, until imperialism is completely finished. As long as the cruel exploitation of monopoly capitalism is not eliminated, the struggle flames of the exploited people will burn ever more fiercely, until exploitation is completely eliminated. As long as colonialism does not collapse, the revolutionary flames of the colonial people will burn ever higher, until colonialism completely collapses. This is an objective law that cannot be shifted by human will!

    人民烈火扑不灭
    承里
    帝国主义及其走狗反动派，在熊熊的革命烈火面前，出动了军马、警棍、水龙、催泪弹、步枪、坦克、飞机、大炮等等武器，施尽了恐吓、威胁、分裂、收买、欺骗等等伎俩，企图扑灭这革命烈火。但这一切，都是枉费心机。人民是吓不倒的，革命烈火是扑不灭的。美帝国主义在南朝鲜，出动过警察、坦克，发表过欺骗声明，威胁、欺骗群众，但并没有挽救李承晚垮台完蛋。美帝国主义在古巴，出动过飞机，收买过特务，进行过威胁，但古巴人民的革命斗争越来越坚决。法国在阿尔及利亚、比利时在刚果、英国在北罗得西亚，使用了种种镇压武器，耍尽了恐吓手段，结果是反殖民主义斗争烈火，越烧越旺盛。岸信介也用尽一切威胁、欺骗手段，但斗争的群众却从几十万、几百万到上千万，浩浩荡荡冲向东京街头，冲向国会，冲向岸信介的官邸。
    人民的革命烈火，是永远扑不灭的。只要帝国主义不完蛋，全世界人民反对帝国主义的烈火，就会越烧越旺，直到帝国主义彻底完蛋。只要垄断资本主义的残酷剥削不消灭，被剥削人民的斗争烈火，就会越烧越炽烈，直到彻底消灭剥削。只要殖民主义不垮台，殖民地人民的革命火焰，就会越烧越高，直到殖民主义彻底垮台。这是不以人的意志为转移的客观规律！
