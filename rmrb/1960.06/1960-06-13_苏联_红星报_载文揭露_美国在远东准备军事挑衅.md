Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 11th. The Soviet newspaper "Red Star" today published an article pointing out that U.S. militarists are preparing military provocations in the Far East against the Chinese people. The article said that fabricating rumors is the second profession of American diplomats and military leaders. For example, U.S. Secretary of State Herter said on May 27th that "Communist China" is planning to "take military action" in the Far East. The article pointed out that the essence of this clamor is very simple: it is because U.S. imperialism itself is preparing new military provocations against the Chinese people. First of all, they are instigating Chiang Kai-shek elements to carry out new adventures.

　　The article pointed out that U.S. warships and aircraft are constantly violating China's territorial waters and airspace. American "U-2" spy planes have penetrated deep into Chinese airspace three times. The article said that the facts show that someone is indeed preparing military provocations in the Far East, but it is not China that is preparing military provocations, but the U.S. militarists and their running dogs, the Chiang Kai-shek elements.

　　The article said, as the proverb says, "A duck cannot crush a person to death." The American puppet in Taiwan will never be able to control the Chinese mainland forever. As for the provocateurs, the Chinese people have ways to teach them a lesson.

    苏联“红星报”载文揭露
    美国在远东准备军事挑衅 　 新华社莫斯科11日电　苏联“红星报”今天发表文章指出，美国军国主义者正在远东地区准备军事挑衅，来反对中国人民。文章说，造谣是美国外交家和军事领导人的第二职业。例如，美国国务卿赫脱5月27日就说什么“共产党中国”正打算在远东“采取军事行动”。文章指出，这种叫嚣的实质很简单，这是因为美帝国主义自己正在对中国人民准备着新的军事挑衅，首先，他们正在唆使蒋介石分子进行新的冒险活动。　　文章指出，美国军舰和飞机不断侵犯中国领海和领空，美国“U—2”型间谍飞机曾三次深入中国领空。文章说，事实表明，在远东确是有人在准备着军事挑衅，然而，准备军事挑衅的不是中国而是美国军国主义者及其走狗蒋介石分子。　　文章说，正如谚语所说：“鸭子踩不死人”，在台湾的美国傀儡已经永远控制不了中国大陆了，至于挑衅者，中国人民是有办法教训他们的。
