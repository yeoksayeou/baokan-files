    Go to the Front Lines to Solve Problems
    Chen Zhiyan
    Offering ideas and devising solutions are regular tasks for every comrade engaged in enterprise leadership. However, some ideas and solutions both raise and resolve problems; some raise problems but don't quite solve them; and some don't even grasp the problem. What is the key? It lies in whether your ideas and solutions are tailored to the actual situation and whether they concentrate the wisdom of the masses.

    To truly discover problems and then offer ideas, devise solutions, and solve problems, you must go to the production front lines. Can you raise and solve problems by listening to reports, making phone calls, and issuing instructions in the office? Of course, you can, and this is one method of managing production. However, in the midst of the fervent mass movement of technological revolution, and in the high tide of production that is rising wave upon wave, the situation is developing rapidly, and this method often cannot adapt to the needs of the situation. Many problems cannot be addressed with good ideas and solutions unless you delve into the workshops and mines to investigate.

    But this is not the main point. The main point is that even the best leader cannot be omniscient and devise solutions to all problems alone. In the movement, new problems emerge endlessly. If you don't go to the front lines, discuss and study with the workers, and concentrate the opinions of the masses, you cannot solve problems specifically and meticulously. After the Party Secretary of the Huainan Coal Mine in Anhui Province went deep into the Xinzhuangzi Mine and studied with the workers, he found ten key problems affecting production. Then, he organized the workers to discuss, everyone acting as a Zhuge Liang, and the leader then concentrated everyone's opinions and solved the ten key problems one by one. As a result, the daily coal output increased in late May. Could these ten key problems have been discovered sitting in the Coal Bureau's office? Generally speaking, it is unlikely. Even if they were discovered, without the Zhuge Liang that is the working masses, could the Party Secretary alone have quickly and specifically solved all ten problems? It would also be difficult.

    In order to achieve a substantial increase in production in June and complete half of the annual plan in the first half of the year, many leading cadres in various places have gone to the front lines in a mighty contingent. This is a signal. A signal that production is bound to reach a new high. Going to the front lines to solve problems, this is in terms of grasping production. The great significance of leading cadres going deep into the grassroots and participating in production together with the workers also lies in the fact that this is a fundamental system for the proletariat to run enterprises.

    到第一线去解决问题
    陈之衍
    出主意、想办法，这是每个做企业领导工作的同志的经常工作。可是，有的主意和办法，既提出了问题又解决了问题；有的主意和办法，提出了问题，却不大解决问题；有的主意和办法，甚至连问题也没有抓住。关键何在呢？在于你的主意和办法是否切合实际情况，是否集中了群众的智慧。
    要想真正发现问题，然后出主意、想办法，解决问题，就必须到生产第一线去。在办公室中听汇报、打电话、发指示，能不能提出问题、解决问题呢？当然也能，这也是抓生产的一种工作方法。但是在如火如荼的技术革命的群众运动中，在一浪高一浪的生产高潮中，形势的发展日新夜异，这个方法常常不能适应形势的需要。许多问题，你不深入到车间中、矿井里去摸摸，就提不出好主意、好办法。
    这还不是主要的。主要的是一个最好的领导者，也不可能万事皆通，一个人就能想出解决一切问题的办法。在运动中新问题层出不穷，如果不到第一线去，和工人群众在一起商量研究，把群众的意见集中起来，就不可能具体地细致地解决问题。安徽淮南煤矿的党委书记深入到新庄孜矿以后，和工人一起研究，找到了影响生产的十个关键问题，然后组织工人讨论，人人当诸葛亮，领导者再集中大家的意见，把十个关键问题一一解决了，结果5月下旬煤的日产量提高了。坐在矿务局的办公室里能不能发现这十个关键问题呢？一般地说不大可能。即便发现了，如果没有工人群众这个诸葛亮，党委书记一个人，能不能很快地把这十个问题都具体解决呢？也是困难的。
    为了实现6月份大幅度增产，上半年完成全年计划一半，各个地方许多领导干部都浩浩荡荡上前线去了。这是一个信号。生产必然有一个新高涨的信号。到第一线去解决问题，这是就抓生产来讲。领导干部深入基层和工人一起参加生产的重大意义，还在于这是无产阶级办企业的一项根本性的制度。
