Xinhua News Agency, 18th. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the heads of the various Chinese industrial unions held a meeting this afternoon, angrily condemning "Plague God" Eisenhower's activities in Taiwan to plot aggression and preparation for war, and expressing firm support for the People's Liberation Army Fujian Front troops' bombardment of Kinmen to hold anti-American armed demonstrations, and firm support for the just and patriotic anti-American struggles of the people of Asian countries.

The meeting was presided over by Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. In his speech, he said that the Chinese People's Liberation Army's bombardment of Kinmen to hold anti-American armed demonstrations fully demonstrated the firm will and determination of the Chinese workers and the people of the whole country to oppose US imperialism, as well as their contempt and disdain for the head of US imperialism, Eisenhower. All Chinese workers fully support this great anti-American armed demonstration and are determined to fight to the end against the shameless aggression and military provocations of US imperialism against our country.

Liu Ningyi sternly condemned the crime of US imperialism's armed occupation of our country's territory of Taiwan and its conspiracy to create "two Chinas" in an attempt to turn Taiwan into a springboard for launching wars of aggression. He solemnly stated that the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan.

Liu Ningyi pointed out that the magnificent and heroic struggles of workers and people in Japan, South Korea, Turkey, and other Asian countries have put US imperialism in a situation where it is like a rat running across the street, chased and beaten by everyone, and is trapped in an unprecedentedly isolated situation. Eisenhower, under the siege of accusations from Asian people everywhere, stubbornly tried to save the fate of his running dogs and resolutely opposed China and the people of Asia. This once again nakedly exposed that US imperialism is the pillar of the most reactionary and most decadent forces in Asian countries and is the most ferocious enemy of the people of Asia and the world.

Liu Ningyi finally said that the people of Asia will teach US imperialism and its running dogs with greater and more resolute struggle actions. The Chinese workers and people stand firmly with the workers and people of Asian countries to fight to the end against the aggression of US imperialism and to drive US imperialism out of the Western Pacific.

Zhao Guoqiang, Chairman of the National Committee of the China Heavy Industry Trade Union, said in his speech that he resolutely supported the anti-American armed demonstration held by the People's Liberation Army Fujian Front troops on behalf of steelworkers across the country. He said that we steelworkers feel extremely angry at Eisenhower's "visit" to Taiwan and his crime of openly provoking the great Chinese people. We are determined to support the struggle to liberate Taiwan with the practical action of producing more high-quality steel.

Li Chunming, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the China Coal Miners' Trade Union, pointed out that Eisenhower's trip to Asia was a conspiracy to plan a new war and to resolutely oppose the Chinese people. He said that Chinese coal miners are determined to accelerate coal mine construction and at the same time produce more coking coal and prime coking coal to support the steel industry and use practical actions to fight back against the provocations of US imperialism.

He Yingcai, Chairman of the National Committee of the China Agricultural and Forestry Trade Union, said that the Chinese People's Liberation Army's use of artillery fire to "welcome and send off" war criminal Eisenhower is a powerful support for the anti-American patriotic struggle of the people of Asian countries and will further encourage the determination and confidence of the people of Asia and the world to fight US imperialism to the end. He stated that agricultural and forestry workers across the country are irreconcilable with US imperialism and are determined to do a good job in production, strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture, support the front lines, and at the same time strengthen militia training, learn skills well, and be ready at any time to smash the aggression and provocations of US imperialism.

Xiao Hongqi, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the China Railway Trade Union, said that Chinese railway workers have a glorious tradition in the struggle against imperialism, and we are irreconcilable with imperialism. US imperialism's occupation of our country's territory of Taiwan and its rampage in Asia have aroused great anger among railway workers across the country. We resolutely support the decision of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Fujian Front Command to hold an anti-American armed demonstration and are determined to support the struggle against US imperialism with practical actions such as completing transportation tasks, stepping up railway construction, and carrying out technical innovations.

Yang Zhihua, Director of the Women Workers' Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Zhang Jing, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the China Textile Workers' Trade Union, said in their speeches that they fully supported the anti-American armed demonstration held by the People's Liberation Army Fujian Front troops on behalf of women workers and textile workers across China. They said that Chinese women workers have a very clear understanding of the robber face and paper tiger original form of US imperialism and unanimously hate, despise, and disdain it. During the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, thousands upon thousands of women workers enthusiastically donated planes and cannons, and many women workers also sent their loved ones to the front lines to fiercely attack the US aggressors. As a result, the US robbers were beaten until their skin was broken and they bled, revealing their paper tiger original form in front of the people of the world. US imperialism is not reconciled to its defeat and is now provoking the great Chinese people and the people of Asia. Women workers across China are determined to transform anger into strength, unite with sisters in Asia and around the world, continuously strengthen the struggle, and overthrow US imperialism.

Fang Ming, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the China Education Trade Union, said that the vast number of teachers and students in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have already widely launched a storm against US imperialism, which shows that more people have seen that US imperialism is a "Plague God," causing it to be hit everywhere. He said that Chinese educators resolutely oppose "Plague God" Eisenhower's trip to Asia and fully support the decision of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Fujian Front Command.

Heads of industrial unions such as machinery, water conservancy and electric power, post and telecommunications, light industry, construction, petroleum, highways, seamen, and finance and trade also spoke at the meeting. They were all filled with righteous indignation and expressed their determination to fight US imperialism to the end.

Also participating in today's meeting were Liu Changsheng and Xu Zhizhen, Vice Chairmen of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Secretariat Secretaries Li Zaiwen, Zhang Xiuzhu, Kang Yonghe, and Xi Zhanyuan, and heads of various departments of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.

Xinhua News Agency, 18th. More than 1,500 staff members from the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China, China Youth Daily, China Youth Publishing House, Central Youth League School, and the Asian-African Student Sanatorium held meetings today, resolutely supporting and backing the People's Liberation Army Fujian Front troops' bombardment of Kinmen to hold anti-American armed demonstrations. Everyone believed that the bombardment boosted the morale of the people and diminished the prestige of the enemy. The great Chinese people despise and scorn the US imperialist robbers and know best what means to use to "teach" the enemy.

Liu Xiyuan, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Communist Youth League Central Committee and Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, delivered a written statement at the meeting of the Communist Youth League Central Committee. In his statement, he said that Eisenhower, the mortal enemy of the Chinese people, dared to break into our country's sacred territory of Taiwan during his robber's trip. This is another serious provocation against the people of our country. The People's Liberation Army has launched a large-scale anti-American armed demonstration on the Kinmen front, and the artillery fire is well executed. It expresses the strong anger and contempt of the 650 million great Chinese people for US imperialism. We express our warm support and resolute backing for this.

Liu Xiyuan said that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people and Chinese youth will never allow US imperialism to stay in Taiwan. We must liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu. The evil conspiracy of US imperialism to create "two Chinas" must be resolutely smashed.

Staff members of the China Youth Publishing House said at the meeting that Eisenhower's robber trip once again proved that the nature of imperialism will not change. Even though Eisenhower was resolutely opposed by the people of Japan and other countries before his trip, he still had to come out to plot aggression and resolutely oppose the Chinese people and the people of Asian countries. Medical personnel from the Asian-African Student Sanatorium said that Eisenhower's trip to Taiwan was interfering in our country's internal affairs and conspiring to completely turn Taiwan into an American colony. This completely exposed his ugly face of "fake peace, real preparation for war; fake relaxation, real aggression." We must not have any unrealistic illusions about US imperialism but must fight them resolutely to the end.

Many people expressed great excitement in their speeches about the increasingly large storm of anti-imperialist struggle by the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. They said: These facts are fully in line with Chairman Mao's brilliant judgment that imperialism is a paper tiger. As long as the people unite and struggle, they will eventually be victorious.

Trainees at the Central Youth League School said at the meeting that in the past, revisionists always tried to whitewash US imperialism, trying to portray Eisenhower as a "messenger of peace." Now, the aggressive face of US imperialism has been greatly exposed, and the revolutionary fighting spirit of the people has been greatly enhanced. This time, wherever Eisenhower announced he would "visit," waves of opposition were launched everywhere.

Xinhua News Agency, 18th. Leaders of the National Women's Federation and the National Committee for the Defense of Children of China held a meeting today, resolutely supporting the anti-American armed demonstration by the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front in bombarding Kinmen, and firmly supporting the just struggle of the people of Asia and the patriotic compatriots of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu against Eisenhower's robber trip.

Cai Chang, Chairman of the National Women's Federation, delivered a written statement. She said: US imperialism has done all kinds of bad things. Now, anti-American waves are being launched everywhere, especially in Asia, where there is strong opposition to Eisenhower's robber trip. The Japanese people raised their fists, giving the Plague God a cold reception. The Philippine people welcomed him with stones. The Korean people also firmly opposed his "visit" to South Korea. He is truly like a rat crossing the street, chased and beaten by everyone. Our anti-American armed demonstration is precisely to support the just struggle of the Asian people and the just struggle of the patriotic compatriots of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu. The earth-shattering artillery fire on the Fujian front fully expresses the angry mood of the people and women of our country and expresses the solemn protest of the people and women of our country against the crimes of aggression by US imperialism. She called on all patriotic Taiwan compatriots to unite and cooperate with our army's anti-American armed demonstration of bombarding Kinmen to wage a resolute struggle against the US aggressors.

Luo Qiong, First Secretary of the Secretariat of the National Women's Federation, said: From deliberately sabotaging the four-nation government summit to this robber trip, Eisenhower has further exposed the unchanging nature of imperialist aggression. US imperialism is the mortal enemy of the people all over the world. Now, the great storm of the Asian people's revolution has been launched. The head of US imperialism is being beaten everywhere, and the bombardment of Kinmen on the Fujian front shows our great Chinese people's contempt and disdain for the US paper tiger.

Members of the Presidium, Shen Zijiu and Cao Mengjun, and Secretaries of the Secretariat, Li Baoguang and Yang Yunyu, all pointed out in their speeches that the Chinese people are not to be trifled with, and the Asian people are not to be trifled with. Although the situations in various Asian countries are different, the people of various countries have taken united action against Eisenhower's robber trip. No matter what tricks US imperialism plays, Taiwan is ours, and our artillery fire is to express our determination to liberate Taiwan, to support the struggle of the Asian people, and to strive for peace in the world.

Responsible cadres of the National Women's Federation and the National Committee for the Defense of Children of China spoke one after another, condemning Eisenhower's robber trip, and unanimously believed that the ugly face of US imperialism has been completely exposed. It is becoming more and more isolated, and the final victory is ours.

Xinhua News Agency, 18th. The China Peace Committee held a meeting this afternoon, resolutely supporting the "Letter to the Military and Civilian Compatriots of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu" from the Fujian Front Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, opposing the aggressive crimes of US imperialism and its head Eisenhower, and supporting the just struggle of compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu.

Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, first made a speech at the meeting. He said that robbers cannot do good deeds when they go out. The Far East trip of Eisenhower, the number one war criminal, and his visit to Taiwan, are conspiracies to plan new wars of aggression and an attempt to maintain his precarious bully status in the Far East. He believed that it is very necessary to use artillery fire to express our great Chinese people's contempt and disdain for this robber boss.

After Guo Moruo's speech, sixteen people spoke one after another. They were: Chen Shutong, Li Dequan, Chu Tunan, Da Puhan, Shi Liang, Xirao Jiacuo, Lao She, Zhou Peiyuan, Yan Jici, Zhao Puchu, Wang Yunsheng, Ji Chaoding, Ma Jian, Mei Lanfang, Tian Han, and Zhuang Mingli. They unanimously pointed out that the bombardment of the "Plague God" expresses the anger and will of the 650 million Chinese people. The Chinese people will never allow Eisenhower, the culprit of war who is stained with the blood of peaceful people, to continue to run rampant. The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan and must fight US imperialism to the end.

Chen Shutong said that the front-line troops' artillery fire to "welcome and send off" Eisenhower is a warning from the Chinese people to him. Eisenhower is the number one war criminal, and using artillery fire to "welcome and send off" him is the best "courtesy."

Li Dequan said that Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the Chinese people will never allow Eisenhower to pollute our sacred territory. The Chinese people must drive the US military from Taiwan back to their old home!

Chu Tunan said that the US imperialists and their head Eisenhower have done all kinds of bad things in the world and are the common enemies of the people of the world. Now Eisenhower has actually run to our sacred territory of Taiwan, and we fully support the bombardment of this "Plague God."

Da Puhan said that Eisenhower, this "Plague God," is too hateful, and he can only be bombarded with artillery. The people of the whole of China support our army in bombarding him with artillery and driving this "Plague God" back to his old home.

Shi Liang said that we were very indignant when we heard the news that Eisenhower, the notorious American robber boss, had arrived in Taiwan, and we were infinitely excited when we heard the news that the front-line troops had bombarded the "Plague God." The people of the whole of China, including the compatriots of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, must unite to oppose US imperialism. Taiwan is our sacred territory, and the robber boss Eisenhower must not be allowed to pollute our land! Drive US imperialism out of Taiwan!

Xirao Jiacuo said: Eisenhower's trip to the Far East was to plot war and was strongly opposed by the people all over the world. Taiwan is China's sacred territory, and the war culprit Eisenhower's visit to Taiwan further exposed his ambition for Chinese territory. We will never allow US imperialism to continue to occupy our territory of Taiwan. He said that I clap my hands together a thousand times to support the front-line troops' bombardment of the "Plague God." This kind of "visit" from this kind of "guest" is truly a "miracle of the ages." Everywhere, he is regarded by the people as a demon, a plague god, and a disaster. The people use demonstrations and bombardments to "welcome and send off" him.

Lao She said that in the world, there is only sending off "Plague Gods," not welcoming "Plague Gods." If you want to welcome "Plague Gods," you have to fire artillery. He also said that we pay our respects to the Japanese people. If the Japanese people do not let Eisenhower go, he cannot go. This shows that the people are not afraid of imperialism, and imperialism must be afraid of the people. As long as the people struggle resolutely, the "Plague God" will definitely be driven away, and the people will definitely be victorious.

Zhou Peiyuan said that we fully support the bombardment of the "Plague God." We must drive US imperialism back to their old home from the Taiwan Strait. US imperialism is holding an olive branch and pretending to be peaceful, but it is actually carrying out aggressive activities. We warn US imperialism that where you launch a war, we will wipe you out there!

Yan Jici said: The "Plague God's" arrival in Taiwan has aroused the great anger of the Chinese people. We shout: "Plague God," get out of Taiwan! Get out of Asia!

Zhao Puchu immediately recited three poems he had written on the spot. The first is: The stolen goods are seized here, and the bandit's nest collapses there. I don't want to reveal the wolf's head, but the sheepskin is stripped off. It stinks, it stinks, it's a real robber. The second is: The bloody case in Tokyo the other day, who is the murderer? A silver-like wax spearhead, how can the public's anger be ignored? I dare not, I dare not, hurry up and shrink your head and get out. The third is: A complete thief, holding a ghost fetus. China's Taiwan, can you run rampant? Fire the artillery, fire the artillery, to send away the "Plague God."

Wang Yunsheng said that the artillery fire on the front line is the voice of 650 million Chinese people. This voice heralds the expulsion of the "Plague God," and this artillery fire expresses the firm will of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan. The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan!

Ji Chaoding said that the encounter of Eisenhower's robber trip this time clearly shows that the Asian people are seeing the essence of Eisenhower, the war criminal, more and more clearly.

Ma Jian said that the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who oppose US imperialism should unite and drive US imperialism back to their old home.

Mei Lanfang said that wherever the war culprit goes, the people there roar with anger and ignite raging fires. This fire, which burns brighter and brighter, will burn US imperialism and its running dogs to ashes.

Tian Han said that more than a year ago, I saw the scene of 10,000 cannons shaking Kinmen to welcome and send off the "Plague God" Dulles on the Fujian front. Today, the front line has sounded the roar of 10,000 cannons to welcome another "Plague God" Eisenhower. The "Plague God" Dulles has gone to the ground, and Eisenhower's ending will not be good.

Zhuang Mingli said that the place where the "Plague God" is bombarded is his hometown, and he speaks the same language as the Taiwan compatriots. He said that US imperialism has done too many bad things in Taiwan in the past few years, and the suffering and humiliation suffered by the Taiwan compatriots are too deep and too great. It is our responsibility to save Taiwan compatriots from the misery, and we must liberate Taiwan. Eisenhower, who is covered in the blood of peaceful people, came to Taiwan, which is a provocation to the Chinese people and must be resolutely countered.

Before the end of the meeting, Guo Moruo spoke again, sternly condemning the despicable behavior of US imperialism in undermining the four-nation government summit, and also severely scolded Eisenhower's robber trip. He used two Chinese idioms to describe the difficult situation of US imperialism, which are: When a house leaks, it rains all night; when sailing a boat, you encounter a headwind.

Xinhua News Agency, 18th. The Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee held a meeting this afternoon, warmly supporting the anti-American armed demonstration by the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front in bombarding Kinmen, resolutely opposing the aggressive crimes of US imperialism and its head Eisenhower, and supporting the just struggle of the people of Asian and African countries and the patriotic compatriots of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu against Eisenhower's robber trip.

Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee, spoke at the meeting. He said that the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee fully supports the "Letter to the Military and Civilian Compatriots of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu" issued by the Fujian Front Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. He pointed out that the purpose of Eisenhower's robber trip this time is to continue to escalate the tense situation, prepare for new wars of aggression, and attempt to further oppress and enslave the people of Asia. He said: "It is very clear that the purpose of Eisenhower's 'visit' to Taiwan is also to step up the promotion of 'two Chinas' and realize the conspiracy to permanently occupy our country's Taiwan. This is another intolerable provocation against our 650 million Chinese people."

He said: "The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, and must complete the great cause of the reunification of the motherland. If US imperialism does not get out of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu as soon as possible, the great Chinese people will definitely drive the invaders back to their old home."

Liao Chengzhi finally said: "The Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee declares that the Chinese people will strengthen unity with the people of South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, and other Asian and African countries with greater determination and strength, support each other, and carry out the just struggle against the aggression of US imperialism and for the defense of world peace until the final and complete victory is achieved."

Mao Dun, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee, said that the anti-American armed demonstration by the Fujian front troops using artillery fire to bombard Kinmen to answer the "Plague God's" visit to Taiwan shows that the people of the motherland resolutely support the just struggle of the patriotic compatriots of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu against Eisenhower's robber trip, and also expresses the great Chinese people's contempt and disdain for Eisenhower. He said that we have the determination and the strength to completely liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, and bring them back to the embrace of the motherland.

The members of the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee spoke enthusiastically at the meeting. They expressed their full support for the "Letter to the Military and Civilian Compatriots of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu" from the Fujian Front Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and supported the just struggle of the patriotic compatriots of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu and the people of Asian countries against Eisenhower's robber trip.

Ju Zan said that the anti-American armed demonstration by the Fujian front troops is completely just. This shows that we have the full strength to oppose the war provocations of US imperialism. He sternly condemned the aggression and war provocations of "Plague God" Eisenhower against the Asian people. He said that the people of the world must be vigilant, strengthen unity and struggle, and completely smash the war conspiracy of US imperialism.

Chen Hansheng said that Eisenhower's trip to the Far East this time to deploy a war of aggression also contains the conspiracy to use Asians to fight Asians. The Fujian front troops have already used artillery fire to express the Chinese people's contempt and disdain. We will also use our pens to fight, to unite the people of all countries, and to defeat the war policy of US imperialism.

Zhuang Mingli said that Eisenhower's "visit" to Taiwan is an insult to the people of Taiwan. He said: The people of Japan, the Philippines, and South Korea have already used practical actions to declare that Eisenhower is an unwelcome person, and the mood of the Taiwan compatriots in opposing Eisenhower's robber trip can also be imagined. He said that overseas Chinese firmly support the armed demonstration of the Fujian front troops and will resolutely fight against the war policy of US imperialism.

Huang Changshui said that the armed demonstration of the Fujian front troops against US imperialism shows the great strength of the motherland and that it is not afraid of the war provocations of US imperialism. It also expresses the Chinese people's resolute support for the struggle of the people of Asian countries against US imperialism. He said that Eisenhower's running into snags everywhere in the Far East vividly illustrates that it is the power of the people, not the reactionaries, that determines the fate of the world.

Zhao Fusan said that the artillery fire of the Fujian front troops bombarding Kinmen will encourage the fighting spirit of the Asian people against the aggression and war provocations of US imperialism and will make the US imperialists tremble. He said that the Chinese people will unite more closely with the people of the world and resolutely fight to send US imperialism to its grave, and that day is not far away.

Da Puhan said that Eisenhower, this "Plague God's" robber trip in various parts of Asia, has made the flames of the anti-American struggle of the people of Asian countries burn higher and higher. He said that all the Chinese people, including the compatriots of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, uniting together, and all the Asian people uniting together, will surely be able to drive US imperialism back to its old home.

Gu Yifan said that the aggressive face of US imperialism has long been exposed, but it is just a paper tiger. As long as the people of all countries unite and resolutely struggle, they will definitely be able to defeat it. The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu. We must wage a resolute struggle against US imperialism.

Le Songsheng and Chen Yifan also spoke at the meeting. They pointed out that the Chinese people will fight more resolutely against the aggressive policy of US imperialism and defend world peace.

Li Dequan, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee, spoke at the end of the meeting. She said that the anti-American armed demonstration by the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front shows the efforts made by the Chinese people to defend world peace. She said: "We will never allow Eisenhower, a war criminal disguised in the cloak of peace, to come to Asia to carry out war provocations. We fully support the Letter to the Military and Civilian Compatriots of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu from the Fujian Front Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. We will never allow US imperialism to occupy our territory of Taiwan! The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan!" Her speech won warm applause from the audience.

    全总、共青团、妇联、和大、亚非团结委员会分别集会庄严表示：
    坚决粉碎美帝国主义策划新战争阴谋
    中国人民一定要解放祖国领土台湾
    新华社18日讯　中华全国总工会和中国各产业工会负责人今天下午举行集会，愤怒谴责“瘟神”艾森豪威尔到台湾策划侵略和备战活动，表示坚决支持中国人民解放军福建前线部队炮轰金门举行反美武装示威，坚决支持亚洲各国人民的反美爱国正义斗争。
    会议由中华全国总工会主席刘宁一主持。他在讲话中说，中国人民解放军炮轰金门举行反美武装示威，充分表示了中国工人和全国人民反对美帝国主义的坚强意志和决心，以及对美帝国主义头子艾森豪威尔的蔑视和鄙视。中国全体职工完全拥护这个伟大的反美武装示威，坚决同美帝国主义对我国的无耻侵略和军事挑衅斗争到底。
    刘宁一严厉谴责美帝国主义武装侵占我国领土台湾，并且阴谋制造“两个中国”，企图把台湾变为它发动侵略战争的跳板的罪行。他庄严表示，中国人民一定要解放台湾。
    刘宁一指出，日本、南朝鲜、土耳其和其他亚洲国家工人和人民波涛壮阔的英勇斗争，已使美帝国主义像老鼠过街、人人喊打一样，陷于到处挨打、空前孤立的境地。艾森豪威尔在亚洲人民到处声讨的围攻下，硬着头皮企图挽救它的走狗的命运，坚决与中国及亚洲人民为敌。这再一次赤裸裸地暴露了美帝国主义是亚洲各国最反动、最腐朽势力的支柱，是亚洲和全世界人民的最凶恶的敌人。
    刘宁一最后说，亚洲人民将以更大的、更坚决的斗争行动来教训美帝国主义及其走狗们。中国工人和人民坚决同亚洲各国工人和人民在一起，为反对美帝国主义的侵略、把美帝国主义从西太平洋赶出去而斗争到底。
    中国重工业工会全国委员会主席赵国强在讲话中，代表全国钢铁工人表示坚决拥护人民解放军福建前线部队举行反美武装示威。他说，我们钢铁工人对艾森豪威尔到台湾“访问”、公然向伟大的中国人民进行挑衅的罪行，感到极大的愤怒。我们决心以生产出更多的优质钢的实际行动，来支援解放台湾的斗争。
    中国煤矿工会全国委员会副主席李春明指出，艾森豪威尔的这次亚洲之行是阴谋策划新的战争，坚决同中国人民为敌。他说，中国煤矿工人决心加速煤矿建设，同时生产更多的炼焦煤和主焦煤支援钢铁工业，用实际行动回击美帝国主义的挑衅。
    中国农林工会全国委员会主席何英才说，中国人民解放军用炮轰来“迎送”战争贩子艾森豪威尔，这对亚洲各国人民的反美爱国斗争是强有力的支持，必将进一步鼓舞亚洲人民和全世界人民同美帝国主义斗争到底的决心和信心。他表示，全国农业和林业工人同美帝国主义誓不两立，决心搞好生产，争取农业大丰收，支援前线，同时要加强民兵训练，学好本领，随时准备着粉碎美帝国主义的侵略和挑衅。
    中国铁路工会全国委员会副主席萧洪启说，中国铁路工人在反对帝国主义的斗争中具有光荣的传统，我们同帝国主义誓不两立。美帝国主义占领我国领土台湾，并且在亚洲横行霸道，更激起全国铁路工人的极大愤怒。我们坚决支持中国人民解放军福建前线司令部举行反美武装示威的决定，并决心以完成运输任务、加紧铁路建设和开展技术革新等实际行动，来支持反对美国帝国主义的斗争。
    全国总工会女工委员会主任委员杨之华和中国纺织工会全国委员会副主席张静在讲话中，代表全中国女工和纺织工人表示完全拥护人民解放军福建前线部队举行反美武装示威。她们说，中国女工对美帝国主义的强盗嘴脸和纸老虎原形认识得很清楚，一致对它仇视、蔑视和鄙视。抗美援朝期间，千千万万女工曾踊跃捐献飞机大炮，许多女工还送自己的亲人上前线狠狠打击美国侵略者，结果把美国强盗打得皮破血流，在全世界人民面前现出了它的纸老虎原形。美帝国主义不甘心它的失败，现在又向伟大的中国人民和亚洲人民挑衅，全中国女工决心化愤怒为力量，同亚洲以及全世界姊妹们团结在一起，不断加强斗争，打倒美帝国主义。
    中国教育工会全国委员会副主席方明说，目前亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的广大教师和学生已经广泛掀起一个反对美帝国主义的风暴，这说明已经有更多的人看出美帝国主义是“瘟神”，使它处处受到打击。他说，中国教育工作者坚决反对“瘟神”艾森豪威尔的亚洲之行，完全拥护中国人民解放军福建前线司令部的决定。
    在会上发言的，还有机械、水利电力、邮电、轻工业、建筑、石油、公路、海员、财贸等产业工会的负责人。他们个个义愤填胸，表示坚决同美帝国主义斗争到底。
    参加今天集会的，还有中华全国总工会副主席刘长胜、许之桢，书记处书记栗再温、张修竹、康永和、郗占元和全国总工会各部门的负责人。
    据新华社18日讯　中国共产主义青年团中央机关、中国青年报社、中国青年出版社、中央团校和亚非学生疗养院的工作人员一千五百多人今天纷纷举行集会，坚决拥护和支持人民解放军福建前线部队炮轰金门举行反美武装示威。大家认为，这次炮轰长了人民的志气，灭了敌人的威风。伟大中国人民鄙视、蔑视美帝国主义强盗，最懂得用什么手段来“教训”敌人。
    共青团中央书记处书记、中华全国青年联合会主席刘西元在共青团中央机关的集会上发表了书面谈话。他在谈话中说，中国人民的死敌艾森豪威尔在他的强盗旅行中，竟敢闯进我国的神圣领土台湾，这是对我国人民的又一次的严重挑衅。人民解放军在金门前线掀起了反美武装大示威，大炮打得好，它表达了六亿五千万伟大的中国人民的强烈愤怒和对美帝国主义蔑视和鄙视，对此，我们表示热烈的拥护和坚决支持。
    刘西元说，在中国共产党和毛主席领导下中国人民和中国青年，决不容许美帝国主义赖在台湾不走。我们一定要解放台、澎、金、马。美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的罪恶阴谋必须坚决粉碎。
    中国青年出版社的工作人员们在会上说，艾森豪威尔的强盗旅行，再一次证明了帝国主义的本性是不会改变的。尽管艾森豪威尔在出行之前，就受到日本等国人民的坚决反对，但是他还是要出来策划侵略阴谋，坚决与中国人民及亚洲各国人民为敌。亚非学生疗养院的医疗人员说，艾森豪威尔到台湾去是干涉我国的内政，阴谋把台湾完全沦为美国殖民地。这就完全暴露了他的“假和平、真备战，假和缓、真侵略”的丑恶面目。我们决不能对美帝国主义存在任何不切实际的幻想，而必须同它们坚决斗争到底。
    许多人在发言中，对于最近亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民反帝斗争的风暴越来越大都感到非常兴奋。他们说：这些事实完全符合毛主席所说的帝国主义是纸老虎的英明论断。只要人民团结起来进行斗争，最后终能得到胜利。
    中央团校的学员们在会上说，过去修正主义者老是为美帝国主义搽脸抹粉，想把艾森豪威尔打扮成“和平使者”。现在，美帝国主义的侵略面貌大暴露了，人民的革命斗志大大提高了。这次艾森豪威尔宣布要“访问”的地方，就到处掀起了反对的浪潮。
    据新华社18日讯　全国妇女联合会及中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会的负责人，今天举行集会，坚决拥护福建前线我人民解放军炮轰金门的反美武装示威，坚决支持亚洲人民和台澎金马爱国同胞反对艾森豪威尔强盗旅行的正义斗争。
    全国妇联主席蔡畅发表了书面谈话。她说：美帝国主义做尽了坏事。现在到处掀起了反美浪潮，特别是亚洲各地强烈反对艾森豪威尔的强盗旅行。日本人民高举拳头，给瘟神吃了闭门羹；菲律宾人民用石头欢迎他；朝鲜人民也坚决反对他到南朝鲜“访问”，真正是老鼠过街，人人喊打。我们举行反美武装示威，正是支持亚洲人民的正义斗争，支持台、澎、金、马爱国同胞的正义斗争。福建前线震天动地的炮声，充分表达了我国人民和妇女愤怒的心情，表示了我国人民和妇女对美帝国主义侵略罪行的严正抗议。她呼吁一切有爱国心的台湾同胞团结起来，配合我军炮击金门的反美武装示威，同美国侵略者作坚决斗争。
    全国妇联书记处第一书记罗琼说：艾森豪威尔从蓄意破坏四国政府首脑会议到这次进行强盗旅行，更进一步暴露了帝国主义侵略的本性难移。美帝国主义是全世界人民的死敌。现在，亚洲人民革命的大风暴已经掀起来了。美帝国主义的头子到处挨揍，福建前线的炮轰金门，是表示了我们伟大中国人民对美国纸老虎的蔑视和鄙视。
    主席团委员沈兹九、曹孟君、书记处书记李宝光、杨蕴玉都在发言中指出：中国人民不是好欺的，亚洲人民不是好欺的。尽管亚洲各国的情况不同，但是各国人民对艾森豪威尔强盗旅行却采取了一致行动。不管美帝国主义耍什么花招，台湾是我们中国的，我们开炮，是表示坚决解放台湾的意志，是为了支持亚洲人民的斗争，是为了争取全世界的和平。
    全国妇联和中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会的负责干部纷纷发言，谴责艾森豪威尔强盗旅行，一致认为：美国帝国主义的狰狞面目完全败露了，它越来越孤立，最后胜利是我们的。
    据新华社18日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会今天下午举行集会，坚决拥护中国人民解放军福建前线司令部“告台、澎、金、马军民同胞书”，反对美帝国主义及其头子艾森豪威尔的侵略罪行，支持台、澎、金、马同胞的正义斗争。
    和大主席郭沫若首先在会上发表谈话。他说，强盗出门做不出好事，头号战争贩子艾森豪威尔的远东之行并且来到台湾，是阴谋策划新的侵略战争，想来维持他在远东摇摇欲坠的恶霸地位。他认为：用打炮武装示威来表示我们伟大中国人民对这个强盗头子的蔑视与鄙视，是很必要的。
    在郭沫若讲话以后，有十六个人先后发言。他们是：陈叔通、李德全、楚图南、达浦生、史良、喜饶嘉措、老舍、周培源、严济慈、赵朴初、王芸生、冀朝鼎、马坚、梅兰芳、田汉、庄明理。他们一致指出，炮轰“瘟神”表达了六亿五千万中国人民的愤怒和意志，中国人民决不容许沾满和平人民鲜血的战争祸首艾森豪威尔继续横行霸道，中国人民一定要解放台湾，一定要同美帝国主义斗争到底。
    陈叔通说，前线部队发炮“迎送”艾森豪威尔，这是中国人民对他的警告。艾森豪威尔是头号战争贩子，用炮轰来“迎送”他，这是最好不过的“礼遇”。
    李德全说，台湾是中国的领土，中国人民决不许艾森豪威尔沾污我国神圣的领土，中国人民一定要把美国军队从台湾赶回老家去！
    楚图南说，美帝及其头子艾森豪威尔在世界上做尽了一切坏事，是世界人民的共同敌人。现在艾森豪威尔竟然跑到我国神圣领土台湾来，我们完全拥护炮轰这个“瘟神”。
    达浦生说，艾森豪威尔这个“瘟神”太可恨了，对它只有用大炮轰。全中国人民支持我军用大炮轰他，把这个“瘟神”轰回老家去。
    史良说，听到臭名远扬的美国强盗头子艾森豪威尔到台湾的消息，我们非常愤慨，听到前线部队炮轰“瘟神”的消息，我们又无限兴奋。全中国人民包括台、澎、金、马同胞在内，要团结起来反对美帝。台湾是我国神圣领土，绝不允许强盗头子艾森豪威尔沾污我们的土地！把美帝国主义从台湾赶出去！
    喜饶嘉措说：艾森豪威尔远东之行，是来策划战争，受到全世界人民强烈的反对。台湾是中国的神圣领土，战争祸首艾森豪威尔到台湾，更暴露了他对中国领土的野心，我们绝不容许美帝国主义继续霸占我们的领土台湾。他说，我一千次地合掌拥护前线部队炮轰“瘟神”。这种“客人”的这样的“访问”真是“千古奇观”，到处被人民看成是魔鬼、瘟神、灾难，人民用示威、炮轰来“迎送”他。
    老舍说，世界上只有送“瘟神”，没有迎“瘟神”的，要迎“瘟神”，就得开炮。他又说，我们向日本人民致敬，日本人民不让艾森豪威尔去，他就不能去。这说明，人民不怕帝国主义，帝国主义就得怕人民。人民只要坚决斗争，“瘟神”一定能驱除，人民一定能胜利。
    周培源说，我们完全拥护炮轰 “瘟神”。一定要从台湾海峡把美帝赶回老家去。美帝手里拿着橄榄枝假装和平，实际上在进行侵略活动。我们警告美帝国主义你在那里发动战争，就在那里把你消灭掉！
    严济慈说：“瘟神”到台湾，激起了中国人民的极大愤怒。我们高呼：“瘟神”从台湾滚出去！从亚洲滚出去！
    赵朴初即席读了他即席写的三首词。第一首是：这里贼赃抓到，那里匪巢倒灶。不想露狼头，无奈羊皮剥掉。臭了臭了，道地一名强盗。第二首是：前日东京血案，谁是杀人凶犯？银样腊枪头，众怒岂容轻犯。不敢不敢，赶快缩头滚蛋。第三首是：十足贼头贼脑，怀着鬼胎来到。中国的台湾，容你横行霸道？开炮开炮，要把“瘟神”送掉。
    王芸生说，前线的炮声，是六亿五千万中国人民的声音。这声音预告着要驱走“瘟神”，这炮声表示了中国人民一定要解放台湾的坚强意志，中国人民一定要解放台湾！
    冀朝鼎说，艾森豪威尔这次强盗旅行的遭遇，明显地说明了亚洲人民对艾森豪威尔这个战争贩子的本质是看得越来越清楚了。
    马坚说，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲反对美帝国主义的人民团结起来，把美帝国主义赶回它的老家去。
    梅兰芳说，战争祸首到了那里，那里的人民都响起愤怒吼声，燃起熊熊烈火，这越燃越旺的大火将把美帝国主义及其走狗焚烧净尽。
    田汉说，一年多以前，在福建前线曾经看见万炮震金门迎送“瘟神”杜勒斯的情景，今天，前线又响起了万炮迎另一个“瘟神”艾森豪威尔的吼声。杜勒斯这个“瘟神”入地了，艾森豪威尔的下场是不会好的。
    庄明理说，炮轰“瘟神”的地方就是他的家乡，他和台湾同胞讲着同一的语言。他说，美帝国主义这几年在台湾作的坏事太多了，台湾同胞受的苦难和侮辱太深太大了。从水深火热的苦难中拯救台湾同胞是我们的责任，我们一定要解放台湾。浑身沾满了和平人民鲜血的艾森豪威尔到台湾，是对中国人民的挑衅，必须坚决给予回击。
    集会结束前，郭沫若再一次讲话，他严厉谴责美帝国主义破坏四国政府首脑会议的可鄙行为，又痛骂艾森豪威尔的强盗旅行。他用中国的两句成语来形容美帝国主义的困难境地，这就是：屋漏遇到连夜雨，行船又碰顶头风。
    新华社18日讯　中国亚非团结委员会在今天下午举行集会，热烈拥护中国人民解放军福建前线部队炮轰金门举行反美武装示威，坚决反对美帝国主义及其头子艾森豪威尔的侵略罪行，支持亚非各国人民和台、澎、金、马爱国同胞反对艾森豪威尔强盗旅行的正义斗争。
    中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志在会上讲话。他说，中国亚非团结委员会完全拥护中国人民解放军福建前线司令部发表的“告台、澎、金、马军民同胞书”。他指出，艾森豪威尔这次强盗旅行的目的是继续加剧紧张局势，准备新的侵略战争，企图进一步压迫和奴役亚洲人民。他说：“很明显，艾森豪威尔‘访问’台湾的目的，还想加紧推行‘两个中国’和实现永久霸占我国台湾的阴谋，这是对我们六亿五千万中国人民又一次不可容忍的挑衅行为。”
    他说：“中国人民一定要解放台、澎、金、马，一定要完成伟大的祖国统一事业。美帝国主义如不早日从台、澎、金、马滚出去，伟大的中国人民一定要把侵略者赶回老家去。”
    廖承志最后说：“中国亚非团结委员会声明，中国人民将以更大的决心和力量来和南朝鲜、日本、菲律宾及亚非各国人民加强团结，互相支持，把反对美帝国主义侵略和保卫世界和平的正义斗争进行到取得最后的、彻底的胜利。”
    中国亚非团结委员会副主席茅盾说，福建前线部队用炮轰金门的反美武装示威来回答“瘟神”到台湾来这一行动，表示祖国人民坚决支持台、澎、金、马爱国同胞反对艾森豪威尔强盗旅行的正义斗争，同时也表示了伟大的中国人民对艾森豪威尔的蔑视和鄙视。他说，我们有决心也有力量把台、澎、金、马完全解放，使它们回到祖国怀抱来。
    中国亚非团结委员会的委员们在会上热烈发言，他们表示完全支持中国人民解放军福建前线司令部的“告台、澎、金、马军民同胞书”，支持台、澎、金、马爱国同胞和亚洲各国人民反对艾森豪威尔强盗旅行的正义斗争。
    巨赞说，福建前线部队的反美武装示威完全是正义的，这说明我们完全有力量反对美帝国主义的战争挑衅。他严厉谴责了“瘟神”艾森豪威尔对亚洲人民的侵略和战争挑衅，他说：全世界人民必须提高警惕，加强团结和斗争，彻底粉碎美帝国主义的战争阴谋。
    陈翰笙说，艾森豪威尔这次到远东来部署侵略战争，还包含着利用亚洲人打亚洲人的阴谋。福建前线部队已经用炮火来表示中国人民的鄙视和蔑视，我们也将用笔来战斗，来团结各国人民，击败美帝国主义的战争政策。
    庄明理说，艾森豪威尔的“访问”台湾，是对台湾人民的侮辱。他说：日本、菲律宾、南朝鲜人民已经用实际行动来宣布艾森豪威尔是不受欢迎的人，台湾同胞反对艾森豪威尔强盗旅行的心情也是可以想到的。他说，国外华侨坚决支持福建前线部队的武装大示威，并且将为反对美帝国主义的战争政策而坚决斗争。
    黄长水说，福建前线部队对美帝国主义的武装示威，表现了祖国的伟大力量，不怕美帝国主义的战争挑衅，也表示了中国人民对亚洲各国人民，反对美帝国主义斗争的坚决支持。他说，艾森豪威尔在远东到处碰壁，生动地说明了决定世界命运的是人民的力量，而不是反动派。
    赵复三说，福建前线部队轰击金门的炮声，将鼓舞亚洲人民反对美帝国主义侵略和战争挑衅的斗志，将使美帝国主义者战栗。他说，中国人民将和全世界人民更紧密地团结起来，为把美帝国主义送进坟墓而坚决斗争，而这个日子已经不远了。
    达浦生说，艾森豪威尔这个“瘟神”在亚洲各地的强盗旅行，使亚洲各国人民反美斗争的火焰越烧越高。他说，包括台、澎、金、马同胞在内的全中国人民团结起来，全亚洲人民团结起来，就一定可以把美帝国主义打回它的老家去。
    顾一凡说，美帝国主义的侵略面目早已暴露无遗了，但它不过是一只纸老虎而已。只要各国人民团结起来坚决进行斗争，就一定能把它打倒。中国人民一定要解放台、澎、金、马。我们一定要同美帝国主义进行坚决斗争。
    在会上讲话的还有乐松生、陈依范。他们指出，中国人民将更坚决地进行斗争，反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和保卫世界和平。
    中国亚非团结委员会副主席李德全在集会结束的时候讲了话。她说，中国人民解放军福建前线部队的反美武装示威表示了中国人民为保卫世界和平所作的努力。她说：“我们绝不容许披着和平外衣的战争贩子艾森豪威尔到亚洲来进行战争挑衅，我们完全拥护中国人民解放军福建前线司令部的告台、澎、金、马军民同胞书，我们决不容许美帝国主义侵占我国的领土台湾！中国人民一定要解放台湾！”她的讲话博得了全场的热烈掌声。
