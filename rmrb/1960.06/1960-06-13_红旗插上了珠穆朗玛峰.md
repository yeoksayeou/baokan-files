    "Spring" in the Mount Everest Area
    Dense white clouds began to rise among the silver peaks of Mount Everest. The ice on the Rongbuk River broke, and the rushing torrents crashed against the rocks with a resounding sound; the permafrost softened, and tender green shoots sprouted from the withered yellow grass on the mountainsides; the agile Himalayan eagles suddenly increased in number, circling in twos and threes over the Mount Everest area…
    It was already mid-May, and the weather was gradually warming up. Experienced people knew that soon, the monsoon from the Indian Ocean would blow across the Mount Everest area, followed by a continuous rainy season.
    The meteorological staff at the Mount Everest base camp became more nervous and busy than ever. Red weather balloons were constantly rising into the sky; various meteorological instruments standing on the slopes and beside the rocks were in constant motion. People waited anxiously for the last good weather "cycle" in the Mount Everest area before the rainy season arrived, in order to begin the battle to conquer the summit of Mount Everest.

    Ready to Go
    This period of good weather finally arrived.
    Starting from May 14th, batches of transportation team members set off from the base camp one after another, first transporting a large amount of high-altitude technical equipment and food to an altitude of over 7,600 meters, waiting for the arrival of the team members who would assault the summit.
    In the past few days, many slogans have suddenly appeared outside the tents at the base camp, fully demonstrating the mountaineers' determination to conquer Mount Everest.
    On the morning of May 17th, the Rongbuk Valley was shrouded in clouds and mist. The brave mountaineers were all full of energy and ready to go.
    At 9:00 AM Beijing time, the mountaineers held a grand oath-taking ceremony at the base camp square at an altitude of 5,120 meters.
    The mountaineering team entrusted a five-star red flag and a white plaster bust of Chairman Mao to the team members who would assault the summit, asking them to overcome all difficulties, advance bravely, and be sure to let the five-star red flag of the motherland fly on the world's highest peak – Mount Everest.
    The mountaineers stood in neat rows, and led by Deputy Captain Xu Jing, they all excitedly raised their right hands and swore:
    Respected Party, respected Chairman Mao, under your guidance, we have unwavering confidence and infinite strength, and no difficulties can stop our victorious advance.
    Our perseverance is unstoppable, our unity is invincible, and all our team members guarantee to you that we will not retreat until we conquer the summit in the fourth march.

    The Fourth March – The Battle to Assault the Summit Begins
    Amidst the deafening sound of gongs and drums and cheers, the mountaineers bid farewell to their comrades at the base camp and embarked on their journey, advancing towards the cloud-covered mountains.
    In order to save time, the mountaineers reached Camp III at an altitude of 6,400 meters with a day of rapid marching. The next day, they climbed the "North Col" ice slope and arrived at Camp IV at an altitude of 7,007 meters.
    After several days of arduous marching, on the afternoon of the 23rd, Xu Jing led thirteen mountaineers to a place at an altitude of 8,500 meters, and here they rebuilt the eighth camp, which had been established on a rocky slope during the third march, on a rare snow slope with an inclination of about 30 degrees. This was the last high-altitude camp of the Chinese mountaineering team on the north slope of Mount Everest – the "Assault Camp".
    At 10:00 PM Beijing time on May 23rd, a signal flare was launched from Camp III at an altitude of 6,400 meters, indicating that "May 24th would be a day of good weather."
    This good news greatly excited the mountaineers and strengthened their confidence in conquering the summit.

    Advancing to the Summit
    On the morning of May 24th, the sun was shining brightly, and the cone-shaped peak of Mount Everest stood out against the blue sky, with朵朵 white clouds lingering among the mountains.
    At 9:30 AM Beijing time, the team members who would assault the summit, led by Deputy Captain Xu Jing, set off from the "Assault Camp" at an altitude of 8,500 meters.
    Xu Jing had been assigned the reconnaissance mission in the previous marches, and his physical strength had been greatly depleted. He only advanced about ten meters before feeling unable to continue. At this time, it was decided that athlete Wang Fuzhou would lead athlete Liu Lianman, Qu Yinhua, and first-class athlete Gonbu (Tibetan), carrying high-altitude backpacks and holding ice axes, to begin the march towards the final three hundred and eighty meters of Mount Everest.
    In order to minimize the load, they only carried oxygen cylinders and a national flag, a plaster bust of Chairman Mao about twenty centimeters high, which the mountaineering team had entrusted them to take to the summit, as well as pencils, notebooks, and movie cameras for writing commemorative notes. But even so, their progress was very slow. Because since they went up the mountain on May 17th, they had experienced a week of arduous marching, and their physical strength had been greatly depleted.

    Fighting Against Numerous Difficulties
    The team members who were assaulting the summit walked for about two hours before ascending seventy meters and arriving at the famous "Second Step" below the summit of Mount Everest. The "Second Step" stood like a city wall on the road to the summit. People advanced with extreme difficulty on its steep and slippery rock face, and after much effort, they could only climb a few steps, and would slip back to the original place with the slightest carelessness. People used various methods to persevere and persevere, and it took them a full five hours to climb the entire rock face with a relative height of about thirty meters and reach the top of the "Second Step" at an altitude of 8,600 meters.
    Although the first hurdle to the summit – the "Second Step" – had been overcome, they still had more than two hundred and eighty meters to go to reach the summit. At this time, the sun had already begun to set, and gusts of cold wind blew from the mountains, making a whistling sound.
    People had previously thought that they could reach the summit before dark, but now it seemed that this estimate was clearly insufficient. Darkness was about to become the second hurdle on their way forward. In the final two or three hundred meters of the north slope of Mount Everest, where humans had never been before, it was really difficult to accurately estimate what difficulties people would encounter and how long it would take.
    As the altitude increased and the marching time lengthened, the oxygen in the oxygen cylinders on people's backs was being consumed more and more; people's physical strength was also becoming weaker and weaker. This meant that they were about to encounter the two most serious hurdles – the threat of severe high-altitude hypoxia and weakness in their limbs.
    Performing high-altitude marching in the dark under conditions of physical weakness and severe hypoxia is very dangerous. But what difficulties can stop the brave Chinese mountaineers from advancing! For the honor of the motherland, to fulfill the entrustment of the people of the whole country, and to reach the summit during the last good weather cycle before the rainy season, the four warriors still forged ahead and continued to advance on the rugged mountain road.

    The Final Moment
    When they reached an altitude of 8,700 meters, Liu Lianman fell to the ground easily due to overwork. Wang Fuzhou, Qu Yinhua, and Liu Lianman quickly held a Party group meeting and decided to leave Liu Lianman behind, while the remaining three would continue to advance even if it was dark.
    After Wang Fuzhou, Qu Yinhua, and Gonbu embarked on their journey, Liu Lianman – this 27-year-old Communist Party member – resolutely saved the little oxygen left in his oxygen cylinder, preparing to leave it for his comrades to use when they returned victoriously. And he himself spent the freezing night by a large rock on this desolate mountain, risking his life.
    The night was dark and hazy all around. Wang Fuzhou and the other two crawled on the ground, relying on the faint reflection of the snow to identify the road, approaching the summit at an extremely slow pace.
    When there were only fifty-two meters left to the summit, the three men ran out of artificial oxygen, and the threat of severe high-altitude hypoxia was imminent. But they were not frightened by the difficulties. Because they had only one belief: to continue to advance and never retreat.
    They threw away the empty oxygen cylinders, encouraged each other, and helped each other, beginning a dangerous and arduous journey unprecedented in human history.
    People were already exceptionally exhausted and could hardly move an inch. However, when there were only five meters left to the summit, they suddenly encountered a cliff again. Gonbu, the 27-year-old Tibetan team member, first climbed up, rested on it for about half an hour, mustered his strength, and helped the other two comrades up. In this way, the summit of the world's highest peak was already within their reach.

    Reaching the World's Highest Peak
    At 4:20 AM Beijing time on May 25th, the three mountaineering heroes endured the test of numerous difficulties and finally reached the summit of the world's highest peak, writing a glorious and brilliant page in the history of Chinese sports.
    Although the weather was very cold at the summit at that time, the joy of victory filled them with enthusiasm. They wrapped the plaster bust of Chairman Mao in the five-star national flag and left it at the summit. Wang Fuzhou – this 25-year-old graduate of the Beijing Institute of Geology – wrote a note on behalf of the three of them, groping in the dark, about their arrival at the summit, and put it in a glove, piling it on the summit with fine stones.
    In order to commemorate the fact that under the leadership of the Party, they had the strong will to complete the first feat in human history of ascending the 8,882-meter summit of Mount Everest from the north slope, they also picked up nine stones at the summit, preparing to bring them back to Beijing to our people's most beloved leader, Chairman Mao.
    Since it was dark at the time and they could not take pictures, they stayed at the summit for about a quarter of an hour and decided to return.
    Soon, the east began to brighten, and the beautiful sunrise first welcomed their triumphant return.
    They saw the footprints they had left on the snow when they climbed the summit, and Qu Yinhua, a 25-year-old forestry worker from Sichuan, immediately captured it in a movie camera – this will be one of the most precious scenes in the film documenting this great mountaineering feat.
    The three men returned to the 8,700-meter point and reunited with their comrade Liu Lianman, who had demonstrated great heroic spirit of self-sacrifice, and continued to walk slowly down the mountain.
    It was not until 6:00 PM Beijing time that day that they returned to the "Assault Camp" at an altitude of 8,500 meters. At this time, a full thirty-two and a half hours had passed since they set off from here on May 24th. During this day and a half, although they did not eat a bite of food or drink a drop of water, their indomitable and invincible will finally led them to victory.

    Victory News Spreads Around the World
    The news of the Chinese mountaineering team's victory quickly spread throughout the country and around the world via radio waves. Sports organizations or friendly organizations from the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Nepal, Japan, India, and the United Kingdom, as well as international peace activists, sent telegrams congratulating the Chinese mountaineering team on completing the most glorious task in the history of world mountaineering – ascending the summit of Mount Everest from the north slope, which had always been considered "insurmountable."
    Although some Western newspapers spread various skeptical atmospheres, they could not help but admit that "the Chinese achievement is outstanding," "the honor was won by China," "they climbed the north slope, which was previously considered unscalable"...
    What is the reason that these young Chinese mountaineers used only two months to break through the most complex difficulties in the history of human mountaineering that had not been broken through for decades?
    As Shi Zhanchun, the captain of the Chinese mountaineering team, said: "Because we have the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and the support of the powerful socialist motherland and the people of all China. These are the sources of our invincible and invincible strength; because we have a sincere heart of infinite loyalty to the cause of the Party, we can do what capitalist countries cannot do."
    Yes, the answer is very clear: because we are the heroic Chinese people! (To be continued) (Attached photo)

    红旗插上了珠穆朗玛峰
    新华社记者　郭超人
    珠穆朗玛山区的“春天”
    珠穆朗玛峰银色的山峦间开始升起浓密的白色云雾，绒布河上的冰层破碎了，奔腾而下的激流撞击着岩石发出响亮的声音；冻土松软了，山坡上枯黄的野草丛中又吐出淡绿色的嫩苗；矫健的喜马拉雅巨鹰突然增多了，三三两两旋飞在珠穆朗玛山区的上空……。
    已是5月中旬，天气渐渐转暖，有经验的人都知道，不久，印度洋上的季风就要吹过珠穆朗玛山区，接着，连绵的雨季就要开始了。
    珠穆朗玛峰下登山大本营的气象工作人员，变得比任何时期都更加紧张繁忙。红色的探空气球不断地升上高空；矗立在山坡上和岩石旁的各种气象仪表，不停地运动。人们怀着焦急的心情，等待着珠穆朗玛山区在雨季到来之前最后一个好天气的“周期”，以便开始夺取珠穆朗玛峰顶峰的战斗。
    整装待发
    这个好天气的周期终于等到了。
    从5月14日起，一批批运输队员就陆续从大本营出发，先把大量高山技术装备和食品提前运送到拔海七千六百米的高度以上，等待突击顶峰的队员们的到来。
    这几天来，在大本营帐篷外面，突然增加了许多标语，充分显示了登山队员们坚决征服珠穆朗玛峰的雄心壮志。
    5月17日清晨，绒布河谷上空云雾迷茫，勇敢的登山队员们一个个精神饱满，整装待发。
    北京时间上午九点，登山队员们在拔海五千一百二十米的登山队大本营广场上，举行了隆重的誓师大会。
    登山队把一面五星红旗和一座毛主席半身白色石膏像委托给突击顶峰的队员们，要他们克服一切困难，奋勇前进，一定要让祖国的五星红旗在世界第一高峰——珠穆朗玛峰上飘扬。
    登山队员们排着整齐的队伍，在副队长许竞率领下，一个个都激动地举起右手，他们宣誓说：
    敬爱的党，敬爱的毛主席，我们在您的教导下，有着坚定不移的信心和无穷无尽的力量，任何困难都阻挡不住我们胜利前进。
    我们的毅力势不可当，我们的团结力大无穷，我们全体队员向您保证，在第四次行军中不征服顶峰，誓不收兵。
    第四次行军——突击顶峰的战役开始了
    在震天响的锣鼓声和欢呼声中，登山队员们告别了大本营的战友，踏上了征途，向云雾重重的山岭间挺进。
    登山队员们为了争取时间，以一天时间的急行军速度，就赶到了拔海六千四百米的第三号营地。第二天，就登上了“北坳”冰坡，到达了拔海七千零七米的第四号营地。
    经过几天的艰苦行军，23日中午，许竞带着十三名登山队员赶到了拔海八千五百米的地方，并在这里把第三次行军时建立在岩坡上的第八号营地，改建在极其难得的一块倾斜度约三十度的雪坡上。这是中国登山队在珠穆朗玛峰北坡上的最后一座高山营地——“突击营地”。
    5月23日晚上北京时间十点钟，从拔海六千四百米的第三号营地发出信号弹，表明“24日为好天气”。
    这个好消息使登山队员们十分兴奋，增强了他们征服顶峰的信心。
    向顶峰进军
    5月24日清晨，阳光灿烂，珠穆朗玛峰尖锥形的顶峰耸立在蓝天之际，朵朵白云在山岭间缭绕不散。
    北京时间上午九点半，突击顶峰的队员们由副队长许竞率领，从拔海八千五百米的“突击营地”出发了。
  许竞在前几次行军中担任了侦察任务，体力消耗很大，他只前进了约十米，感到不能支持。这时，决定由运动健将王富洲带领运动健将刘连满、屈银华和一级运动员贡布（藏族），背着高山背包，扶着冰镐，开始向珠穆朗玛峰最后三百八十多米的高度进军。
    为了尽量减轻负重，他们只携带了氧气筒和登山队委托他们带到顶峰的一面国旗、一个高约二十厘米的毛主席半身石膏像，以及准备写纪念纸条用的铅笔、日记本和电影摄影机等。但即使是这样，他们前进的速度也是非常慢的。因为从5月17日上山以来，他们已经经历了一个星期的艰苦行军，体力有了巨大的消耗。
    与重重难关搏斗
    突击顶峰的队员们约莫走了两个钟头，才上升了七十米，来到珠穆朗玛峰顶峰下著名的“第二台阶”跟前。“第二台阶”像城墙一样，屹立在通向顶峰的路上。人们在它陡滑的岩壁上，前进得异常困难，费了很大劲儿刚刚攀上几步，稍一不小心就又滑落到原来的地方。人们运用各种办法坚持再坚持，整整花了五个多小时的时间，才全部攀登上这个相对高度约三十米的岩壁，到达拔海八千六百米的“第二台阶”的顶端。
    通向顶峰的第一道难关——“第二台阶”虽然克服了，但他们离顶峰还有二百八十多米的高度要走。而这时太阳已经偏西，阵阵寒风从山岭间刮过，发出阵阵啸鸣。
    人们事先以为在天黑以前就能登上顶峰，现在看来，这种估计显然是不足的。黑夜，即将成为他们前进道路上的第二道难关。在这人类从未到达过的珠穆朗玛峰北坡最后二、三百米的路途中，人们将要遇到什么困难，要走多长时间，确实很难精确估计。
    随着高度的上升和行军时间的加长，人们背上氧气筒里的氧气，已消耗得越剩越少；人们的体力，也变得越来越弱。这就是说，他们即将遇到最严重的两道难关——高山严重缺氧和四肢无力的威胁。
    在体力虚弱和严重缺氧的情况下，进行黑夜高山行军，是具有很大危险性的。但是，有什么困难能阻挡得住勇敢的中国登山队员们前进的步伐呢！为了祖国的荣誉，为了完成全国人民的委托，为了在雨季到来以前最后一个好天气的周期内登上顶峰，四位勇士仍然勇往直前，继续行进在崎岖的山路上。
    最后的时刻
    到达拔海八千七百米时，刘连满由于过度疲劳，动不动就跌倒在地上。王富洲、屈银华和刘连满连忙举行了党的小组会，决定让刘连满留下，而其余的三个人即使是天黑，也要继续前进。
    当王富洲、屈银华和贡布走上征途以后，刘连满——这位二十七岁的共产党员，毅然把自己氧气筒里所剩不多的氧气保存起来，准备留给战友们胜利归来时使用。而他自己，就在这荒漠的山岭上，冒着生命危险，在一块大岩石旁度过了严寒之夜。
    夜色浓厚，四周朦胧一片，王富洲等三人匍伏在地面上，依靠着微弱的雪光反照辨认路途，以极其缓慢的速度向顶峰接近。
    距离顶峰还剩下五十二米的高度时，三个人的人造氧气都用完了，高山严重缺氧的威胁已经临头。但他们并没有被困难所吓倒。因为他们只有一个信念：继续前进，绝不后退。
    他们抛掉了空氧气筒，彼此鼓励，你我帮助，开始了人类历史上从未有过的危险而艰巨的历程。
    人们已经异常疲惫，几乎寸步难行。但是，距离顶峰还剩五米时，忽然又遇到一个峭壁，二十七岁的藏族队员贡布首先攀登上去，他在上面休息了约半个小时，鼓起力气又帮助其他两个战友上去。这样，世界最高峰的顶峰已经近在他们咫尺了。
    登上世界最高峰
    5月25日清晨北京时间四点二十分，三位登山英雄经受了重重困难的考验，终于登上了世界最高峰的顶峰，为中国体育史上写下了光辉灿烂的一页。
    当时，山顶天气虽然很冷，但胜利的喜悦使他们热情洋溢。他们把毛主席的石膏像用五星国旗包好，留在顶峰。王富洲——这位二十五岁的北京地质学院毕业生，并代表三个人摸着黑写了个他们三个人到达顶峰的纸条，并把它放进一支手套里，用细石垒起把它压在顶峰上。
    为了纪念在党的领导下，使他们有坚强的毅力完成人类历史上第一次从珠穆朗玛峰北坡登上拔海八千八百八十二米顶峰的创举，他们还在顶峰上拣了九块石头，准备将来回北京时带给我国人民最敬爱的领袖毛主席。
    由于当时天黑，不能拍照，他们在顶峰上停留了大约一刻钟，就决定返回征途。
    不久，东方开始发亮，美丽的旭光首先欢迎他们凯旋归来。
    他们看到自己攀登顶峰时在雪上留下的脚印，二十五岁的四川林业工人屈银华立即把它摄入了电影镜头——这将是纪录这次伟大登山事迹的影片中最宝贵的画面之一。
    三个人回到拔海八千七百米处时，同曾经表现了伟大自我牺牲英雄气概的战友刘连满汇合在一起，继续缓慢地往山下走去。
    直到当天下午北京时间六点钟，他们才回到了拔海八千五百米的“突击营地”。这时，离他们5月24日从这里出发的时间，已经整整过去了三十二个半小时了。在这一天多的时间内，他们虽然没吃上一口饭、喝上一口水，但无坚不摧，无攻不克的毅力，终于使他们获得了最后胜利。
    胜利消息传遍全世界
    中国登山队获得胜利的消息，通过无线电波很快就传遍了全国，传遍了全世界。苏联、保加利亚、尼泊尔、日本、印度、英国的体育组织或友好组织，以及国际和平人士等，纷纷打电报来，祝贺中国登山队完成了世界登山史上最光荣的任务——从过去一直被认为“无法超越的”北坡，登上了珠穆朗玛峰顶峰。
    某些西方报纸尽管散布了种种怀疑气氛，但也不得不承认说：“中国人的成就是杰出的”“荣誉被中国得去了”“他们登上了过去被认为是登不上去的北坡”……。
    是什么原因使得这些年轻的中国登山队员们仅仅用了两个月的时间，就突破了人类登山史上几十年来没能突破的最复杂的难关呢？
    这正如中国登山队长史占春所说的：“因为我们有伟大的中国共产党的领导，有强大的社会主义祖国和全中国人民的支持。这些是我们攻无不克，战无不胜的力量的源泉；因为我们有着一颗对党的事业无限忠诚的赤诚的心，因而我们就能够做到资本主义国家所不能做的事。”
    是的，答案非常清楚：因为我们是英雄的中国人民！（续完）（附图片）
