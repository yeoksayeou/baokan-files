　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 16th: Seoul News: The South Korean people's struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, striving for democracy and the right to survival, is continuing to develop. Some demonstrations and struggles have been victorious.
　　According to South Korean Tonghwa News Agency, citing the reduced statistics of the pseudo "Ministry of Health and Social Affairs," from late April to June 15th, the struggle of South Korean workers to win democracy and demand improved treatment spread to thirty-three factories and enterprises. The workers in these factories and enterprises put forward demands such as "increase wages," "immediately pay overdue wages," and "oppose layoffs," and launched struggles in various forms such as strikes, demonstrations, and sit-in demonstrations.
　　According to reports, fifty to one hundred automobile drivers in Seoul held a demonstration in front of the U.S. Embassy on the 15th. They held large white and blue flags printed with English and Korean characters, and sat on the sidewalk in front of the U.S. Embassy, shouting slogans against the U.S. aggressor authorities' unwarranted dismissal of them. The report said that these demonstrators represented 200 drivers of a transportation company that drives cars for the U.S. military under contract. They held a strike at the beginning of this month to demand higher wages. The U.S. aggressor authorities not only did not agree to their demands, but also ruthlessly fired them.
　　According to the Contract News Agency, the struggle of workers at the Chungju Fertilizer Factory against the collective dismissal of four workers was victorious on the 15th. The news agency said that the struggle of students at Chungbuk University in Cheongju City, North Chungcheong Province, to expel the pro-government president has also been successful. According to reports, the students of this school held demonstrations on May 4th and June 5th, demanding that the president, who colluded with the Syngman Rhee group, get out of the school. Finally, the president had no choice but to resign.
　　In addition, 300 food and beverage industry employees in Jeonju City held a demonstration in the streets on the 13th to protest excessive taxes and levies. They shouted slogans such as "Abolish entertainment and food tax!", "Abolish head tax!", "Reduce business tax!", and held a sit-in demonstration in front of the Jeonju pseudo "Tax Bureau."
　　According to Daejeon Broadcasting Station, the struggle of more than 1,500 merchants in Daejeon City, which began on June 3rd, demanding a reduction in this year's "private business tax" was victorious on the 10th, and the puppet authorities were forced to accept the merchants' demands.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 16th: "Democratic Korea" published a commentary today, condemning U.S. imperialism and the South Korean puppet group for playing the trick of "constitutional amendment."
　　The commentary said: The South Korean puppet National Assembly passed the so-called "cabinet responsibility system constitutional amendment" on the 15th, attempting to use this to deceive the South Korean people who are struggling, in order to maintain the colonial rule of U.S. imperialism.
　　The commentary pointed out that the basic content of the "amended" "constitution" of the South Korean puppet National Assembly is not essentially different from the old "constitution" created by Syngman Rhee to slaughter the people, but only some changes in the wording. For example, the provision on "basic human rights" says that "all freedoms and rights of the people may be restricted by law when it is necessary to maintain order and public welfare." It also says that "it is guaranteed within the basic order of the constitution." However, everyone knows that the so-called "basic order" is the order of the colonial rule of U.S. imperialism.
　　The commentary said that the so-called "cabinet responsibility system constitutional amendment"条款条款"条款条款"条款条款条款条款"条款条款" clauses, which U.S. imperialism and its running dogs have been clamoring about this time, are just changing the "presidential responsibility system" to the "cabinet responsibility system," and changing the colonial rule of U.S. imperialism through the pseudo "president" to carry it out through the pseudo "prime minister."
　　The commentary pointed out that the reactionary nature of this "constitutional amendment" is caused by the reactionary nature of the puppet National Assembly that made it.
　　The commentary emphasized that the South Korean people will never allow the "cabinet responsibility system constitutional amendment" manufactured by U.S. imperialism and its puppets. The South Korean people will thoroughly eliminate the corrupt remnants of the Syngman Rhee regime such as the "caretaker cabinet" and "National Assembly," and must strive for a new politics, a new life, and a new system.

    汉城汽车司机在美国大使馆前示威
    “民主朝鲜报”揭露美许集团玩弄“改宪”骗局迷惑人民
    新华社平壤16日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜各界人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗、争取民主和生存权利的斗争正在继续发展。有的示威斗争取得了胜利。
    据南朝鲜同和通讯社引用伪“保健社会部”缩小了的统计材料报道，从4月下旬到6月15日为止，南朝鲜工人展开的争取民主和要求改善待遇的斗争蔓延扩大到了三十三个工厂企业。这些工厂企业的工人提出了“提高工资”、“立即发给拖欠的工资”、“反对解雇”等要求，并且以罢工、示威、静坐示威等各种形式展开了斗争。
    据报道，汉城有五十到一百名汽车司机15日在美国大使馆门前举行示威。他们举着印有英文和朝鲜文的白色和蓝色大旗，坐在美国大使馆门前的人行道上，高呼口号，反对美国侵略军当局无故解雇他们。报道说，这些示威者代表根据合同为美军驾驶汽车的一家运输公司的二百名司机。他们在本月初曾经举行罢工，要求提高工资。美国侵略军当局不仅不答应他们的要求，而且凶狠地把他们解雇了。
    据合同通讯社报道，忠州肥料工厂的工人们反对集体解雇四名工人的斗争在15日得到了胜利。这家通讯社说，忠清北道清州市的忠北大学学生展开的驱逐御用校长的斗争也已经取得成功。据报道，这个学校的学生曾经在5月4日和6月5日举行示威，要勾结李承晚集团的校长滚出学校。最后这个校长不得不辞职下台。
    另外，全州市三百名饮食业从业人员为反对苛捐杂税13日在大街上举行示威。他们高呼“废除娱乐饮食税！”、“全部废除人头税！”、“降低营业税！”等口号，并在全州伪“税务署”门前举行静坐示威。
    据大田广播电台广播，大田市一千五百多名商人从6月3日展开的要求降低今年“私人营业税”的斗争在10日取得胜利，傀儡当局被迫接受了商人们的要求。
    新华社平壤16日电　“民主朝鲜报”今天发表评论，谴责美帝国主义和南朝鲜傀儡集团玩弄“改宪”骗局。
    评论说：南朝鲜傀儡国会15日通过了所谓“内阁责任制改宪案”，企图以此来欺骗正在进行斗争的南朝鲜人民，以维持美帝国主义的殖民统治。
    评论指出，南朝鲜傀儡国会“修改”后的“宪法”的基本内容，同过去李承晚为了屠杀人民而制造的老“宪法”在本质上没有丝毫差别，只不过是在字句上做了某些调换。如关于“基本人权”的规定说，“国民的一切自由和权利，在为了维持秩序和公共福利有必要的情况下，得以法律加以限制”。又说，“在宪法的基本秩序的范围内加以保障”。但是，谁都知道，所谓“基本秩序”就是美帝国主义殖民统治的秩序。
    评论说，美帝国主义及其走狗这次大肆叫嚷的所谓“内阁责任制改宪”的条款，只不过是把“总统责任制”换为“内阁责任制”，把通过伪“总统”实现美帝国主义的殖民统治改为通过伪“国务总理”来进行罢了。
    评论指出，这次制造的“改宪”的反动性，是由制造它的傀儡国会的反动性而产生的。
    评论强调说：南朝鲜人民决不容许美帝国主义和它的傀儡制造的“内阁责任制改宪案”，南朝鲜人民将彻底清除“看守内阁”、“国会”等李承晚政权的腐败的残渣，一定要争取新的政治、新的生活和新的制度。
