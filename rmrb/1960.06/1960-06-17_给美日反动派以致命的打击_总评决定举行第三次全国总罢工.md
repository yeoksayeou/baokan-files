    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 16th: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan decided tonight to launch a third nationwide twenty-four hour general strike on June 22nd to give the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet and the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" a fatal blow.
    The "Sohyo" also decided that all its member unions will hold one-hour workplace rallies on June 18th. This is, in effect, a one-hour general strike on June 18th.
    This decision was made at an emergency meeting of representatives of "Sohyo" member unions. "Sohyo" convened this meeting to study the new situation created by Nobusuke Kishi's request to the U.S. President for an indefinite postponement of his "visit" to Japan. Earlier in the day, the Japanese "National Council Against Revision of the Security Treaty" had decided to hold demonstrations every day from June 17th to 20th, demanding the resignation of the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, the dissolution of the Diet, and the abolition of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and protesting the police's bloody suppression of the demonstrating masses. According to the decision of the "National Council Against Revision of the Security Treaty," the Japanese people will hold a massive rally of 300,000 people on June 19th.

    给美日反动派以致命的打击
    总评决定举行第三次全国总罢工
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会今天晚上决定，在6月22日发动第三次全国二十四小时总罢工，给予岸信介内阁和新日美“安全条约”以致命的打击。
    “总评”还决定，它所属的所有工会在6月18日举行一小时的工作场所大会。这实际上就是在6月18日举行一小时的总罢工。
    这个决定是“总评”会员工会的代表所举行的紧急会议作出的。“总评”召开这个会议是为了研究由于岸信介要求美国总统无限期延期“访问”日本而造成的新形势。这一天的早些时候，日本“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”已经决定，从6月17日到20日每天都举行示威，要求岸信介内阁辞职、解散国会和废除新日美“安全条约”，并且抗议警察血腥镇压示威群众的暴行。按照“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”的决定，日本人民将在6月19日举行有三十万人参加的声势浩大的群众大会。
