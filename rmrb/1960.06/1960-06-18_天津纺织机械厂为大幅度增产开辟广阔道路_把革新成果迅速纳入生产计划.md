Tianjin, June 17th (From Our Newspaper) - The Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory has promptly incorporated the achievements of technical innovation and technical revolution into its production plans, ensuring that every innovation yields results in production. This has promoted a substantial increase in production. The product output from January to May this year has already completed 45% of the annual plan, 8% more than the actual output from January to November last year.

	Personnel Reduced, Tasks Doubled
	One Method——Technical Revolution

The textile machinery factory's production target for this year is more than double that of last year. In addition, more than 200 people have been transferred to support the new factory. Under these circumstances, the factory leaders did not bow to difficulties, but tried every possible means to mobilize all factory workers to seek equipment, manpower, and raw materials from the technical revolution. Their method was to incorporate the technical innovation projects realized in the previous month into the monthly production plan when formulating the factory's monthly production plan, as a basis for the growth of various indicators such as output, output value, and labor productivity. At the same time, the economic effects of the major innovation measures to be realized this month are also incorporated into the production plan.

	As soon as There is Technical Innovation
	Adjust Indicators Immediately

This practice of quickly reflecting the achievements of innovation in production has powerfully ensured that the monthly production plans are advanced. For example, in May, 35 major innovations were put into production in the factory. When formulating the production plan for June, the indicators were comprehensively adjusted. Based on the achievements of innovation, production increased substantially, and the output target for June was more than 17% higher than the state plan. In May, the Third Workshop reformed the design of the spindles of the roving frame, changing the spindle head from high-quality steel to nodular cast iron, and the spindle rod to cold-drawn non-cutting processing. The high-quality steel used per spindle was reduced from 67 kilograms to 15 kilograms, and the man-hours were reduced from 180 to 38. In the production plan issued in June, the output of spindles increased from 20,000 pieces in May to 60,000 pieces.

	The Innovation Achievements of the First Shift
	Are the Production Plans of the Second Shift

After the technical innovation and technical revolution movements were widely launched, the projects were realized more and faster, and some projects were often unforeseen. If these projects were to be incorporated into the production plan until next month, the achievements of innovation could not be reflected in the production plan in a timely manner. In order to solve this problem, the factory adopted the method of adjusting the daily shift production plan of the workshop sections at any time. The workers in the sixth section of the Second Workshop completed a seventeen-head universal grinding, burring, chamfering, and polishing machine in two days, replacing the manual operation of the entire section, and the production efficiency increased by an average of about 50%. After the previous shift realized this innovation, the second shift adjusted the daily production plan. At the end of April, the factory vigorously improved product design. The workers put forward 780 suggestions for improving design and product technology. The workshops and sections improved and put them into production at the same time, revising the plan. By the end of May, 540 items had been realized. They adopted this method to ensure that the more than 2,900 technical innovation measures realized this year could be reflected in production in a timely manner, so that technical innovation measures could be implemented immediately, and results could be seen in production immediately after implementation.

	Production Plans Set Topics for Technical Revolution
	Technical Revolution Guarantees Production Plans

The Textile Machinery Factory has done a meticulous and in-depth job of incorporating technical innovation achievements into production plans, paying attention to solving new problems in production at any time. The production plan and the technical revolution plan complement each other and promote each other. The production plan puts forward topics for the technical revolution plan according to the needs of production, and the technical revolution plan in turn guarantees the comprehensive and balanced completion of the production plan and continuous improvement. For example, some processes of the iron plate parts in the Eighth Workshop were originally manual operations. After other workshops realized mechanization and automation, the production plan increased substantially, but the iron plate parts in the Eighth Workshop were in short supply. The assembly workshop posted big-character posters to challenge them, demanding that they catch up quickly. The workshop mobilized the workers to launch a fierce competition to attack the "Iron Plate Mountain," focusing on the "one-dragon" key. As a result, 23 innovation measures such as the iron plate leveling spring hammer and the roller six-hole punching machine were realized using indigenous methods and a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, replacing the manual operations of 85 people. In May, these innovation achievements were incorporated into the production plan, and as a result, the task was overfulfilled ten days ahead of schedule.

    天津纺织机械厂为大幅度增产开辟广阔道路
    把革新成果迅速纳入生产计划
    本报天津17日电　天津纺织机械厂把技术革新、技术革命的成果及时纳入生产计划，作到每项革新成果都在生产上见效，促进了生产大幅度上升，今年1至5月份的产品产量已经完成全年计划的45％，比去年1至11月份实际产量还多8％。
    人员减少　任务翻番
    办法一条——技术革命
    纺织机械厂今年的产量任务比去年翻了一番多。又抽调了二百多人支援新厂。在这种情况下，工厂领导干部没有向困难低头，千方百计发动全厂职工向技术革命要设备、要人力、要原料材料；他们采取的办法是在制订全厂月生产计划的时候，把上月实现的技术革新项目纳入生产计划，作为产量、产值、劳动生产率等各项指标增长的依据；同时把本月份将要实现的重大革新措施的经济效果，也纳入生产计划中去。
      一有技术革新
      马上调整指标
    这种把革新成果迅速反映到生产上去的做法，有力地保证了每月的生产计划都订得很先进。例如，5月份全厂投入生产的重大革新有三十五项，在制订6月份生产计划的时候，就全面调整了指标，根据革新成果使生产大幅度上升，6月份的产量指标就比国家计划多17％以上。第三车间5月份改革了并纱机锭子的设计，锭子头由优质钢改为珠墨铸铁，锭杆改为冷拉无切削加工，每台锭子使用的优质钢由六十七公斤减到十五公斤，工时由一百八十个减到三十八个。在6月份下达的生产计划中，锭子的产量由5月份的两万件增加到六万件。
      第一班的革新成果
    是第二班的生产计划
    技术革新、技术革命运动广泛开展起来以后，项目实现的又多又快，有些项目往往是事先预料不到的。这些项目如果等到下个月再纳入生产计划，就不能把革新成果及时地反映到生产计划中来。为了解决这个问题，这个厂就采取了随时调整车间的工段日轮班生产计划的办法。第二车间六工段的工人两天内搞成了一台十七头的万能磨刺倒角刨光机，代替了全工段的手工操作，生产效率平均提高了50％左右。上一班实现了这个革新以后，第二班就调整了日生产计划。4月底工厂大搞改进产品设计，职工提出七百八十项改进设计和产品工艺的建议，各车间工段就边改进、边投入生产，修改计划，到5月底已实现了五百四十项。他们就是采取这个办法，使今年以来实现的两千九百多项技术革新措施，都能及时地反映到生产上来，作到有了技术革新措施立即促其实现，实现以后立即在生产上见效。生产计划给技术革命出课题
    技术革命给生产计划提保证
    纺织机械厂把技术革新成果纳入生产计划的工作作得细致深入，注意随时解决生产出现的新问题，生产计划和技术革命计划相辅相成，互相促进。生产计划根据生产的需要给技术革命计划提课题，技术革命计划又反过来保证生产计划的全面均衡完成和不断提高。例如第八车间的铁板件原来有些工序是手工操作，其它车间实现了机械化、自动化以后，生产计划大幅度上升，而第八车间的铁板件却供应不足，装配车间就贴大字报去叫阵，要求他们迅速赶上去。车间发动了职工开展猛攻“铁板山”关键的“一条龙”大竞赛，结果用土法上马、土洋结合的办法实现了铁板调平弹簧锤、滚筒六孔冲眼机等二十三项革新措施，代替了八十五个人的手工操作。5月份就把这些革新成果纳入了生产计划，结果提前十天超额完成了任务。
