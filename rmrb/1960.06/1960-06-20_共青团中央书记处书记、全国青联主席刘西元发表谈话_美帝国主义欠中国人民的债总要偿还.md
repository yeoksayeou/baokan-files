Xinhua News Agency, June 18th. Liu Xiyuan, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, issued a statement. He said that Eisenhower, the deadly enemy of the Chinese people, dared to intrude into China's sacred territory of Taiwan during his robber trip, which is another serious provocation to the Chinese people. The Fujian Front Command of our People's Liberation Army issued a letter to the military and civilians of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu, launching an anti-American armed demonstration on the Jinmen front, with cannons roaring and shaking the earth. The cannons fired really well, expressing the strong anger of the 650 million great Chinese people and their contempt and disdain for U.S. imperialism. We express our warm support and firm support for this.

Liu Xiyuan said that U.S. imperialism is determined to be enemies with the people of the world to the end. The war-monger Eisenhower's robber trip was intended to come to Asia to plot new wars, strengthen its aggression and oppression of the people of Asian countries, and continue to promote the despicable plan of creating "two Chinas." But contrary to its wishes, the evil activities of U.S. imperialism, in front of the Asian people who have awakened and are awakening, are like adding fuel to the fire, and cannot but ignite greater flames of anger. Wherever Eisenhower announced he would "visit," a wave of resistance was set off. The Japanese people did well, and the South Korean people did well. Even in the Philippines, which has been under long-term U.S. control, the people there also roared against Eisenhower. The ugly face of U.S. imperialism has been exposed more thoroughly. Although it seems that it is still rampant and flaunting its power, it is actually like a rat running across the street, with everyone shouting to beat it, and it is even more deeply trapped in a predicament of being besieged on all sides.

Liu Xiyuan said that Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu are the sacred territory of our great motherland. The Chinese people and Chinese youth under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao will never allow U.S. imperialism to stay in Taiwan. We must liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu. The patriotic compatriots of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu also warmly hope to return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible. Grievances have their source, and debts have their debtors. U.S. imperialism's debt to the Chinese people must always be repaid. The sinister plot of U.S. imperialism to create "two Chinas" must be resolutely crushed. Eisenhower, this "plague god's," sinister activities in Taiwan this time have further aroused the determination and fighting spirit of our people against U.S. imperialism, and will surely further arouse the spirit of common hatred among the patriotic compatriots of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu to carry out the struggle against U.S. imperialism to the end.

    共青团中央书记处书记、全国青联主席刘西元发表谈话
    美帝国主义欠中国人民的债总要偿还
    新华社18日讯　共青团中央委员会书记处书记、中华全国青年联合会主席刘西元发表谈话。他说，中国人民的死敌艾森豪威尔在他的强盗旅行中，竟敢闯进我国的神圣领土台湾，这是对我国人民又一次的严重挑衅。我人民解放军福建前线司令部发表了告台、澎、金、马军民同胞书，在金门前线掀起了反美武装大示威，万炮齐鸣，震天动地。大炮实在打得好，它表达了六亿五千万伟大的中国人民的强烈愤怒和对美帝国主义的蔑视与鄙视。对此，我们表示热烈的拥护和坚决支持。
    刘西元说，美帝国主义决心与全世界人民为敌到底。战争贩子艾森豪威尔的强盗旅行就是想到亚洲来策划新战争，加强它对亚洲各国人民的侵略和压迫，继续推行制造“两个中国”的卑鄙计划。但是事与愿违，美帝国主义的罪恶活动，在已经觉醒和正在觉醒的亚洲各国人民面前，犹如火上加油，不能不燃烧起更大的愤怒火焰。凡是艾森豪威尔宣布要去“访问”的地方，都掀起了反抗的浪潮。日本人民干得好，南朝鲜人民干得好。就是受美国长期控制的菲律宾，那里的人民也发出了反对艾森豪威尔的怒吼。美帝国主义的丑恶面目暴露得更加彻底了，尽管看起来它还在那里横行霸道，耀武扬威，实际上已经是老鼠过街，人人喊打，更深地陷入了四面楚歌的困境。
    刘西元说，台、澎、金、马是我们伟大祖国的神圣领土，在中国共产党和毛主席领导下的中国人民和中国青年，决不容许美帝国主义赖在台湾不走。我们一定要解放台、澎、金、马，台、澎、金、马的爱国同胞也热烈希望早日回到祖国的怀抱。冤有头、债有主，美帝国主义欠下中国人民的债，总是要偿还的。美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的罪恶阴谋必须坚决粉碎。艾森豪威尔这位“瘟神”这次在台湾的阴谋活动，更大的激起了我国人民反对美帝国主义的决心和斗志，也必将更进一步激发起台、澎、金、马爱国同胞同仇敌忾的精神，把反对美帝国主义的斗争进行到底。
