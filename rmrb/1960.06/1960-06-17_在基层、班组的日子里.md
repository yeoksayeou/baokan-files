Party Committee Secretary's Notes

In the Days of the Grassroots and Teams
Li Keliang, Secretary of the Changning County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Hunan

The team is the most basic organizational unit in factories and mines, the foundation of mass movements. It directly connects with the masses, directly organizes and commands production. The implementation of the Party's policies and all measures, and the completion of various production tasks, all rely on the team to realize. Therefore, leaders who frequently delve into teams, discover problems, grasp key issues, solve them in a timely manner, and provide comprehensive guidance can promote continuous leaps in production.

From May of last year, I have been stationed at the Songbai Iron Factory, and over the past year, apart from the time spent attending meetings at the provincial, prefectural, and county party committees, 90% of my time has been spent at the Songbai Iron Factory. I frequently visit workshops and teams to understand the production situation and work with the workers to study and solve production problems.

When I first came to the factory, I was unfamiliar with many people besides the responsible cadres. Therefore, the information I obtained was only a general overview, and I could not promptly grasp the most fundamental practical problems in production. So, I resolved to further delve into the teams, integrate with the workers in production and life, and often watch production and discuss production with them. Gradually, I became familiar with the workers. When the workers saw me, they were no longer as reserved as before. They greeted me with smiles and laughter, which allowed me to understand many situations. Within less than a month of arriving at the factory, I had figured out the reasons for the low furnace output, poor quality, and short lifespan. Tan Shouzhe, the furnace chief of Furnace No. 4, even took the initiative to lead me to inspect the quality of the furnace repairs. I discovered that many refractory bricks were not laid according to specifications. So, I organized cadres and workers to conduct furnace-by-furnace inspections. The workers said, "So that's why the furnace life was so short." After reinforcing the furnace lining with refractory mud, the furnace was repaired very firmly. The furnace no longer had a short life.

After delving into the grassroots and teams, the most important thing is to adhere to conducting "experimental plots" and to do so persistently, regularly, and unremittingly. This will create a "model" for cadres and the masses, better summarize experience, establish a banner, and continuously point out the direction of progress for the masses. I focused on Furnace No. 4, the Communist Youth Furnace, as the key and used it as an experimental furnace. At that time, the furnace's output was not high, and the utilization coefficient was not high. I gathered the furnace cadres and workers to discuss why the output was not high. As a result, we found the reason and improved the furnace's utilization coefficient.

This March, some people developed conservative ideas, believing that "there is no way to improve the utilization coefficient any further." In order to educate cadres and the masses with facts, I went to the front and top of Furnace No. 4 for detailed understanding and observation. I discovered that the furnace top often showed signs of flames. I immediately convened cadres and workers of the entire furnace at the furnace side for discussion. Chen Molin, the foreman of the furnace front, said, "The current air volume is very large, and the amount of ore charged into the furnace per batch is too small, so the furnace top is flaming." I further inquired: Is it possible to charge more ore? Everyone said, "The technicians disagree, fearing that charging too much ore will cause the furnace to die. If the furnace does not die, slowing down the charging speed is the same as using less ore." So, I further induced everyone to discuss whether charging more ore would cause the furnace to die. Zhao Fuming, the deputy director in charge of the furnace, said, "Previously, we used light batches and fast charging mainly because the air volume was low. Now that the air volume has increased, we can increase the load and use large ore batches." I felt that this made a lot of sense. The vast majority of workers agreed with this opinion. I encouraged everyone to experiment boldly. As a result, the amount of ore was increased, and the furnace top no longer flamed. The cadres and workers of the entire furnace further emancipated their minds, and their courage grew. The utilization coefficient continued to break through.

Frequently delving into the grassroots and teams is for discovering problems, breaking through key issues, gaining experience, and guiding the overall situation. Although I have been at the Songbai Iron Factory since May of last year, I have not relaxed the work of other factories and mines. With the guidance of key experiences, the leadership has been further strengthened. I moved the County Party Committee's Industry and Transportation Work Office to the Songbai Iron Factory for work, making the key unit the on-site command headquarters. County-wide industrial meetings and telephone conferences were held at the Songbai Iron Factory. I often introduced the problems I discovered in the teams and the process of solving them to everyone, and emphasized that leading cadres should take the lead in delving into the teams. A movement to go to the workshops, to the teams, to the furnace side, and to the underground working faces was formed, reaching a climax. Now, most of the county-level industrial organizations and cadres of factories and mines directly under the county have delved into the workshops and teams, establishing a total of six "experimental furnaces," twelve "experimental wells," sixty-four "experimental working faces," and one hundred and twelve key teams, which greatly encouraged the masses' enthusiasm for innovation and production, and powerfully promoted production.

    在基层、班组的日子里
    中共湖南常宁县委书记  李克良
    班组是厂矿中最基层的组织单位，是群众运动的基础，它直接联系群众，直接组织和指挥生产，党的方针政策和一切措施的贯彻，各项生产任务的完成，都要依靠班组来实现。因此，领导经常深入班组，发现问题，抓住关键，及时解决，指导全面，就能推动生产不断跃进。
    从去年5月起，我就经常驻在松柏铁厂，一年来，除了在省委、地委和县委开会的时间以外，90％的时间都是在松柏铁厂，经常到车间班组里了解生产情况，和工人一道研究和解决生产中的问题。
    我初来厂里的时候，除了负责干部以外，和许多人都不熟悉，因此，了解的情况只是一个大概，不能及时的了解到生产中最根本的实际问题。于是我下定决心进一步深入到班组去，在生产、生活中和工人们打成一片，经常和工人在一起看生产谈生产，因此和工人慢慢地熟悉起来。工人们见了我以后，再也不像以前那样拘束了，一见面就有说有笑，使我了解到很多情况，到厂不满一个月的时间，就摸清了炉子产量不高，质量差、寿命不长的原因。4号炉的炉长谭寿泽，还主动地领我去检查修炉的质量，发现有很多耐火砖砌得不合规格，于是就组织干部和工人进行炉炉检查。工人们都说：“原来炉子寿命不长，原因就在这里”，经过用耐火泥加固炉缸，把炉子修得非常牢固扎实，炉子再也不短命了。
    深入基层，班组去以后，还有最重要的一条，就是坚持搞“试验田”，并且要长期地、经常地、坚持不懈地搞下去。这样就能给干部和群众做出“样子”来，更好地总结经验，树立旗帜，给群众不断地指出前进的方向。我在厂内确定以4号共青炉为重点，把4号炉作为试验炉。当时炉子的产量不高，利用系数不高，我就召集包炉干部和工人商量，为什么产量不高。结果找出了原因，提高了炉子的利用系数。
    今年3月有些人产生了保守思想，认为：“利用系数再也没有办法提高了。”为了用事实教育干部和群众，我又到4号炉炉前炉顶进行详细的了解和观察，发现炉顶经常有冒火的现象，便立即在炉边召集全炉的干部和工人商量。炉前班长陈谟林说：“现在的风量很大，每批料入炉的矿石太少，所以炉顶冒火”。我进一步探问：是不是可以多下矿石呢？大家说：“技术人员不同意，怕下多了矿石会死炉，如果不死炉，料速放慢了，就和少矿石是一样的。于是我又进一步诱导大家讨论，多下矿石，会不会死炉的问题。包炉的副厂长赵福明同志说：“以前采用轻批快料，主要是风量少了，现在风量加大，可以加重负荷，采用大料批”。我觉得这话说得很有道理。绝大多数工人都同意这个意见。我便鼓励大家大胆试验，结果增加了矿石，炉顶也不冒火了。全炉干部和工人进一步解放了思想，胆子越来越大，利用系数接连不断的突破。
    经常深入基层、班组是为了发现问题，突破关键，取得经验，指导全面。从去年5月起，我虽然在松柏铁厂，但是对于其他厂矿的工作，不但没有放松，由于有了重点经验作指导，领导更加强了。我把县委工业交通工作办公室也搬到松柏铁厂办公，将重点单位成为现场指挥部，全县性的工业会议，电话会议，都在松柏铁厂召开。我经常把自己在班组里发现的问题和解决的经过，介绍给大家，并强调领导干部带头深入班组。这样一个到车间去、到班组去、到炉边去、到井下壋头去的运动，便形成了高潮。现在全县县级工业机关及县直属厂矿的干部已大都深入到车间、班组，一共搞了六个“试验炉”，十二个“试验井”，六十四个“试验壋头”，一百一十二个重点班组，大大鼓舞了群众的革新热情和生产积极性，有力地推动了生产。
