    We Must Liberate Taiwan
    Guo Moruo

    Taiwan, you have been occupied by American imperialism for a full ten years! The motherland is concerned about you, concerned about our eight million brothers and sisters, who are living in misery under the iron heel of the United States. The longer you are away from the motherland, the worse your experiences, the deeper your longing for the motherland; you must never have forgotten the warmth of the motherland for a single moment. Today's motherland is mastering the three magic weapons and is continuously leaping forward. We will reach the highest peaks in the world in every aspect, just like our mountaineers who have climbed Mount Everest; we can catch up with and surpass Britain in less than ten years. We must liberate Taiwan and let our Taiwan compatriots return to the embrace of the motherland. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly strong, which is the fortress of peace and the core of the forces for peace. Socialist countries are advancing by leaps and bounds on the production and cultural fronts at a speed of one day equaling twenty years, demonstrating the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system and the unparalleled vitality of Marxism-Leninism. We are moving forward hand in hand and heart to heart towards a common goal; we are getting better day by day, and the enemy is rotting day by day. The wheel of history cannot be reversed by any reactionary force, and the East Wind is increasingly overwhelming the West Wind. American imperialism is on its last legs, and its life will not be too long! Although it is still flaunting its power, it is only a dying flash. It is the most tyrannical and ferocious enemy of world peace, and therefore it is also subjected to the deepest hatred of the people of the world. The encounter of the bandit leader Eisenhower is the best evidence. The Soviet Union canceled his visit, the Japanese people gave him the cold shoulder, he was hit by stones in Manila, bombarded in the Taiwan Strait, and relied on a helicopter to flee half an hour early in Okinawa. In Seoul, he was surrounded by the masses and dared not move in the streets. The plague god is fleeing for his life, which is the doomsday scene of American imperialism. A drowning person grabs at a straw as a life preserver, and American imperialism is doing just that, grabbing at straws everywhere. In Turkey, it grabs Menderes, in South Korea, it grabs Syngman Rhee, in Japan, it grabs Nobusuke Kishi, in South Vietnam, it grabs Ngo Dinh Diem... Menderes, Syngman Rhee, and Nobusuke Kishi have all been overthrown by the people, how long can the remaining few straws be relied upon? Awakened people, united, the power is irresistible. The people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are all awakened, and everyone is uniting more closely to strive for national independence; everyone is uniting more closely to strive for the liberation of all mankind! Taiwan compatriots, you must also unite further, please take the Korean people and the Japanese people as your example, and show the power you displayed three years ago when you smashed the American embassy! If someone is willing to be Syngman Rhee, Nobusuke Kishi, or Menderes, it is his own choice to walk the road to ruin, and he is willing to be a gravedigger for American imperialism. The life of American imperialism will not be long, how can the life of its lackeys be long? The American Seventh Fleet and aircraft carriers are just targets to be hit; American military bases and rockets and missiles are weapons to hit themselves. Those things are used to scare people, but they can't scare people; if you are afraid of it, it will eat you; if you are not afraid of it, it will be afraid of you. There is no doubt that the final victory will definitely belong to the people! We must resolutely strive for this final victory of the people, we must liberate Taiwan and let Taiwan return to the embrace of the motherland! We must make American imperialism and its servants tremble with fear! We must make the traitorous modern revisionists tremble with fear! We will never invade others, but we will never tolerate others invading us; we love peace, but we will never beg for it from the aggressors. If the aggressors want to launch a war, that is their own self-destruction! The twentieth century is undoubtedly the century of the demise of imperialism. This is a scientific prediction, and this is the law of the development of human history.

    一定要解放台湾
    郭沫若台湾，你被美帝国主义侵占整整十年了！祖国在关切着你，关切着八百万的兄弟姊妹，你们在美国铁蹄下过着水深火热的日子。离开祖国愈久，遭遇愈坏，怀念祖国便愈深；你们也一定没有一刻忘记了祖国的温暖。今天的祖国正掌握着三大法宝不断地跃进，无论在哪一方面我们都要攀上世界最高峰，就像我们的登山队员攀上了珠穆朗玛那样；我们不到十年就可以赶上英国，超过英国了。我们一定要解放台湾，让台湾同胞归回祖国的怀
  抱。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营正日益强大，这就是和平力量的堡垒，和平力量的核心。社会主义国家都在以一天等于二十年的速度，在生产战线上，文化战线上不断地飞跃进展，显示着社会主义制度的无比的优越性，显示着马克思列宁主义的无比的生命力。我们正手携手，心连心，向着一个目标前进；我们一天天的好起来，敌人一天天的烂下去。历史的车轮是任何反动力量所不能逆转的，东风正一天天的进一步地压倒了西风。美帝国主义是日落西山，它的寿命不会太长了！它虽然还在耀武扬威，那不过是回光返照。它是世界和平的最横暴、最凶恶的敌人，因而它也受着了世界人民的最深沉的憎恨。强盗头子艾森豪威尔的遭遇是最好的证据，苏联取消了他的访问，日本人民享以闭门羹，在马尼拉挨到石块，在台湾海峡受到炮轰，在那霸靠着直升飞机提前半小时匆匆逃跑，在汉城受到群众的包围，不敢在大街上行动。瘟神逃命，这就是美帝国主义的末日景象。落下水的人抓着一根稻草也当作救生圈，美帝国主义也正是如此，在四处抓着稻草。在土耳其抓着曼德列斯，在南朝鲜抓着李承晚，在日本抓着岸信介，在南越抓着吴庭艳，……曼德列斯、李承晚、岸信介都被人民轰垮了呵，剩下的几根稻草又能够依靠到几时呢？觉醒了的人民，团结起来，力量是不可抵抗的，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的人民都一齐觉醒了，大家正在加倍地团结，争取本民族的独立；大家正在加倍地团结，争取全人类的解放！台湾同胞们，你们也进一步团结起来，请以朝鲜人民、日本人民作你们的榜样，显示出三年前你们捣毁美国使馆的威力吧！如果有人甘愿做李承晚、岸信介、曼德列斯，那是他自走绝路，自己甘愿做美帝的殉葬者。美帝的寿命不会长，难道走狗的寿命还会长吗？美国的第七舰队、航空母舰只是挨打的靶子；美国的军事基地、火箭导弹是打自己的武器。那些东西是拿来唬骇人的，但也骇不倒人；如果怕它，它就吃你；如果不怕它，它就怕你。毫无疑问，最后的胜利一定是属于人民的！我们要坚决地争取这最后的人民的胜利，我们一定要解放台湾，让台湾归回祖国的怀抱！我们要让美帝国主义和它的仆从们骇得发抖！我们要让现代修正主义者的叛徒们骇得发抖！我们决不侵略人，但也决不能忍受别人侵略；我们热爱和平，但也决不向侵略者乞求。侵略者如果要发动战争，那就是他自掘坟墓！二十世纪毫无疑问是帝国主义灭亡的世纪，这是科学性的预言，这是人类历史的发展规律。
