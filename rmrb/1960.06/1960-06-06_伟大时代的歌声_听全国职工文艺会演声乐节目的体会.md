The Song of a Great Era
    ——Reflections on Vocal Music Programs at the National Workers' Art Performance
    Meng Yu, Zheng Xingli, Zhao Zhangwu

    In this National Workers’ Art Performance, various regions presented outstanding programs with unique characteristics. Among the six hundred plus programs, vocal music accounted for over two hundred and thirty, most of which possessed high ideological and artistic merit, as well as excellent singing skills, and were warmly welcomed by the audiences in the capital. They were truly rich and colorful, a feast for the senses. In terms of content, they vividly sang the praises of the Party and the leaders from various perspectives, celebrated the "Three Great Banners" and new people and new deeds, and lauded the earth-shaking changes in the motherland. The themes were clear, the forms were novel, the styles were prominent, and they possessed the characteristics of the times.

    The chorus "Singing Beside Chairman Mao," created and performed by workers from Beijing, stirred every audience member with its passionate singing. Their resounding voices displayed their determination and will to overcome difficulties in the construction of the motherland. The stage presented a vibrant, optimistic image of the working class, full of youthful vigor. The vocal timbre was unified, and the articulation was clear. The enthusiastic singing conveyed the immense happiness of living beside Chairman Mao, the boundless happiness of the Chinese people living in the era of Mao Zedong.

    Among the works that praised heroic figures with noble communist qualities, the chorus "Singing of Ling Wenming" from the Jiangxi delegation described the deeds of Ling Wenming, an outstanding son forged in the crucible of revolution, a hero on the battlefield, and a vanguard in construction. The music was written in a simple and powerful style, and the use and development of local folk songs made it sound particularly intimate and moving. The chorus ended in a majestic song, singing of the people of Jinggangshan continuing to leap forward under the inspiration of Ling Wenming's communist spirit of selflessness. Other excellent choral works included selections from "Chopping the Yellow River in Two," "Militia Supporting the Front," "Singing of Heroic Jianming Commune," "Spring in the Miao Mountains," and the Mei-Hu joint performance "Offering Songs."

    The performance song and small chorus were also one of the forms in this performance that reflected a wide range of subjects. For example, the Shandong delegation’s ballad medley “A Thunderclap in Spring” sang about the fierce struggle in 1922 when the carpenters of Changsha, under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao, drove away the feudal headmen and established their own organization - the Carpenters' Union. The performance was very successful, and both the form and the music had new developments compared to the original ballad, while also being different from the general performance song. The Shandong delegation's "Leap Forward Songs Never End" expressed the people's love for the new society. The dialogue of several old men expressed their different personalities, and the musical tune appropriately expressed the content of the lyrics. Although several verses used the same tune, each verse felt fresh, creative, and humorous. The Hebei delegation's "Eight Sisters Herding Pigs" successfully portrayed the image of working women in New China who dared to think and act, and advanced alongside men. Their voices were bright and natural, and the classical dance movements they used were uniform and powerful. Musically, they created a new melody by integrating Tangshan shadow play tunes and folk song materials, which was beautiful and moving. The small chorus "Female Militia" from the Jilin delegation also had the above characteristics. The Henan Opera performance song "Innovation Expert Qiao Wenshan," the Gansu delegation's "Pig-Raising Model Fan Xiucai," Shanghai's Pingtan small chorus "Revolutionary Sparks Bloom All Over the City," Jiangsu's Pingtan small chorus "Singing of the Eighth Plenary Session," and Beijing's female small chorus "Ode to the Great Hall of the People" all developed on the original forms and created new melodies in order to express new ideas and characters, while still maintaining the original characteristics. With the cooperation of creators and performers, we believe that new achievements will continue to be made in using local operas and storytelling music to write small choruses and performance songs that express new content.

    In terms of male small choruses, Shaanxi's "This Car Is Not Simple," Hunan's "Yuan River Boat Song," Heilongjiang's "Striving for First Place in Production Games," and Hubei's "John Bull Stares Blankly" all broke through the previous performance forms and more vividly expressed the content.

    Many solo performances in the performance left a deep impression on the audience. The singers sang the achievements of the motherland's construction with full enthusiasm, their emotions were full, and their performances were sincere. For example, Geng Wanpeng's singing of the Hua'er "Forever Following the Party," with its bright and vast voice, simply and movingly sang the heartfelt gratitude of the grassland people to Chairman Mao; he had a good grasp of the local style, and his breath control was free. Comrade Gao Wenxiu has made achievements in her efforts to learn from folk traditional operas, as can be proven from her performance of the Henan Opera "Hongniang."

    The old cook Xue Chuanxun sang the Liuqin song "The More I Sing, the Happier I Feel," which he wrote himself after shedding his illiteracy this year. This performance truthfully wrote about his own joyful mood of no longer being an illiterate, and wrote about his gratitude to the Party and his determination to study culture. The lyrics were so concise, simple, and vivid. He not only wrote well, but also sang very kindly and movingly.

    There are also many solo performers who have their own characteristics in terms of emotional expression, voice, vocal skills, and mastery of style, such as Wu Pei, Wu Fuerhasen, Dong Kedu, Li Jingyi, Liu Xinming, Zhou Yingdi, Yang Songshan, Jiang Jingru, He Jiaqing, Jin Lianhua and other comrades who have shown their talents in singing and are deeply welcomed by the audience.

    The large number of excellent vocal programs and many excellent actors that emerged in this performance deeply touched us with the working class's full enthusiasm, soaring energy, heroic temperament, and cheerful personality, and are worthy of our good study.

    Judging from the vocal music programs of the performance, we feel that the following points are particularly noteworthy:

    First, more than 90% of the programs reflect reality, not only are the themes wide-ranging, but they also quickly coordinated with the central tasks. For example, after American imperialism undermined the Four-Power Summit Conference, songs, clapper talk, and cross talk immediately appeared at the evening party, expressing the Chinese people's anger at American imperialism. Because the worker comrades have continuously improved their socialist consciousness under the leadership of the Party, have the ambition and determination to overcome difficulties, and have a rich life, they write about themselves and sing about themselves, and are very truthful, simple, and optimistic in their thoughts and feelings, showing the temperament of the working class.

    Second, the program forms are novel and diverse, especially the small chorus and performance song, which promote the tradition of singing and dancing of various ethnic groups in our country, and at the same time have new creations, and also well express the new life and characters. This form is deeply loved by the broad masses of people. The singing is mainly based on folk singing methods, with a distinct style, and it sounds intimate and moving. A few people also used Western singing methods to sing, and made a lot of efforts in the nationalization of Western singing methods.

    Third, the creation and performance showed the collectivist spirit of the working class. The large chorus "Singing Beside Chairman Mao," written by several workers in Beijing, went through more than 20 discussions and revisions by all the more than 400 actors, and solicited the opinions of professional artists, so that the work was more perfect in terms of ideology and artistry. Another example is the song "The More I Sing, the Happier I Feel" written by Comrade Xue Chuanxun, which was also helped and revised by many comrades from the performance and lyrics, so that it became more concise. The combination of professional and amateur, the combination of individual wisdom and mass wisdom, is a good practice for prospering creation.

    With the growth of the workers' cultural and artistic team, many talented actors have emerged. They are experts and models in production, and they are also active propagandists, singers, and outstanding creators in literature and art. This shows that only in socialist countries can the wisdom and talents of the working people be fully utilized. This performance was very successful and showed the great victory of Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art! Through the performance, the vigorous development of workers' amateur cultural and artistic activities will be accelerated, and the construction of the motherland will be promoted more forcefully to leap forward.

    伟大时代的歌声
    ——听全国职工文艺会演声乐节目的体会
    孟于　郑兴丽　赵章武
    这次全国职工文艺会演，各地都有独具特色的优秀节目，在六百多个节目中，声乐占了二百三十多个，大都具有较高的思想性、艺术性和演唱技巧，受到了首都观众的热烈欢迎。真是丰富多彩，美不胜收。在内容上，它们从各个不同的角度生动地歌颂了党和领袖，歌颂了“三大万岁”以及新人新事，歌颂了祖国翻天复地的变化。主题鲜明，形式新颖，风格突出，具有时代特征。
    北京市工人创作和演唱的大合唱“在毛主席身边歌唱”，热情的歌声激动着每一个观众。他们响亮的歌声显示了对祖国建设不怕困难的决心和意志。舞台上出现了充满青春活力的、乐观主义的工人阶级形象。演唱的音色统一，吐字清晰。从热情的歌声中，使人感到生活在毛主席身边的无比幸福，生活在毛泽东时代的中国人民的无比幸福。
    在歌颂具有共产主义高贵品质的英雄人物的作品中，江西代表团的合唱“歌唱凌文明”，描写了革命的熔炉锻炼出来的优秀儿子凌文明，在战场上是英雄，在建设事业中是尖兵的事迹。音乐写得朴实有力，特别是采用了当地的民歌加以发展，听起来更是亲切动人。合唱结束在雄壮的歌声中，唱出了井冈山人民在凌文明舍己为人的共产主义精神鼓舞下的继续跃进。在合唱方面还有“腰斩黄河”选曲、“民兵支前”、“歌唱英雄的建明社”、“苗岭的春天”、郿鄠联唱“献歌”等等都是优秀的作品。
    表演唱和小合唱也是这次会演节目中反映题材很广泛的形式之一，如湖南代表团的弹词联唱“霹雳一声春雷动”，唱出了1922年长沙泥木工人在毛主席亲自领导下，赶走封建把头，成立工人自己的组织——泥木工会这一场激烈的斗争。演唱得很成功，在形式上和音乐上都较原来的弹词有了新的发展，同时又不同于一般的表演唱。山东代表团的“跃进歌儿唱不绝”表现了人民对新社会的热爱。几个老汉的对白，表现了他们不同的性格，音乐曲调也恰如其分地表现了歌词的内容，虽然几段歌词采用了同一曲调，但每段都使人觉得新鲜，有创造，有风趣。河北代表团的“八姐妹赶猪”成功地塑造了新中国劳动妇女敢想敢干，与男子并肩前进的形象。她们的声音明亮、自然，所采用的古典舞动作，运用得整齐有力。在音乐上，采用了唐山皮影调和民歌素材融合创作出新的曲调，优美动听。吉林代表团的小合唱“女民兵”也具有上述的特点。河南梆子表演唱“革新能手乔文山”、甘肃代表团的“养猪模范范秀才”、上海的评弹小合唱“革命火花开满城”，江苏的评弹小合唱“歌唱八中全会”、北京的女声小合唱“人民大会堂颂”，为了表现新的思想和人物，在原有的形式上有了发展，唱腔上有了新的创造，但仍然保持了原有特色。在创作者和演员的合作下，我们相信，运用地方戏曲和说唱音乐来编写表现新内容的小合唱、表演唱方面，会不断地获得新的成就。
    在男声小合唱方面，陕西的“这个汽车不简单”、湖南的“沅水行牌”、黑龙江的“生产运动会上争第一”、湖北的“约翰牛干瞪眼”等都突破了以往的表演形式，更生动地表达了内容。
    会演中有许多独唱节目给予听众很深的印象。演唱者以充沛的热情来歌唱祖国建设的成就，情绪饱满，表演真切。如耿万鹏演唱的花儿“永远跟着党”，那明亮而辽阔的声音，朴实动人地唱出了草原人民对毛主席的衷心感谢；他较好地掌握了地方风格，气息运用自如。高文秀同志在努力向民间传统戏曲的学习上是有成绩的，从她演唱豫剧“红娘”的表演上就能得到证明。
    老炊事员薛传训演唱的柳琴唱“越唱心里越快活”，是他在今年摘掉文盲帽子之后自己编写的。这个演唱真实地写出了他自己不再做睁眼瞎的喜悦心情，写出了他对党的感激和努力学文化的决心。歌词是那么简练、朴素、生动。他不仅编写得好，演唱得也非常亲切动人。
    还有很多独唱演员在情感的表现上、声音上，在声乐技巧上，在掌握风格上都各有特点，如吴沛、吴甫尔哈森、董克笃、李静一、刘心明、周英娣、杨松山、蒋静茹、何家庆、金莲花等同志在演唱上都显示了自己的才能，深为观众所欢迎。
    这次会演中涌现出的大批优秀声乐节目和很多优秀演员，表现的工人阶级那种充沛的热情、冲天的干劲、豪迈的气质、爽朗的性格等方面，深深地感动了我们，值得我们好好地学习。
    从会演的声乐节目看来，我们觉得以下几点是特别值得注意的：
    第一，90％以上的节目都是反映现实的，不仅题材很广泛，而且迅速地配合了中心任务。如美帝国主义破坏了四国政府首脑会议后，马上晚会上就出现了歌曲、快板、相声，表示中国人民对美帝国主义的愤怒。由于工人同志们在党的领导下，不断提高了社会主义觉悟，有着战胜困难的雄心壮志，有着丰富的生活，因此写自己，唱自己，在思想感情上很真实、淳朴、乐观，表现出工人阶级的气质。
    第二，节目形式新颖多样，特别是小合唱和表演唱发扬了我国各民族载歌载舞的传统，同时有新的创造，又很好地表现了新的生活和人物，这种形式深为广大人民所喜爱。在演唱上是以民间唱法为主的，风格鲜明，听起来亲切动人。也有少数人运用了西洋唱法来演唱，在西洋唱法民族化的方面作了不少的努力。
    第三，在创作和表演上显示了工人阶级集体主义的精神。北京几位工人写的大合唱“在毛主席身边歌唱”，经过全体演员四百多人二十多次的讨论和修改，并征求了专业艺术工作者的意见，因而使作品在思想性上，艺术性上更加完善。又如薛传训同志自己写的“越唱心里越快活”一歌，也是经过很多同志从表演上，歌词上帮助修改，才更为精练。专业与业余结合，个人智慧与群众智慧结合，是繁荣创作的很好的作法。
    随着职工文艺队伍的壮大，不断涌现出很多有才能的演员，他们在生产上是能手、是模范，在文艺上又是活跃的宣传员、歌手、出色的创造者，这说明了只有在社会主义国家里才能充分地发挥劳动人民的智慧和才能。这次会演是很成功的，显示了毛泽东文艺思想的伟大胜利！通过会演将加速职工业余文艺活动的蓬勃发展，更有力地推动祖国建设事业向前跃进。
