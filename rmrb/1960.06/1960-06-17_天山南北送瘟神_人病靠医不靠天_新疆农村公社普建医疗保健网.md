Sending Away the God of Plague North and South of the Tianshan Mountains: People's Illnesses Depend on Doctors, Not Heaven
Rural Communes in Xinjiang Universally Establish Medical and Healthcare Networks

(Reported by our newspaper) Rural people's communes in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have universally established hospitals and maternity hospitals. Among the region's 451 people's communes, more than 1,000 commune hospitals, management district health centers, production team health stations, and various levels of maternity hospitals have been established, possessing more than 3,000 beds. A rural medical and healthcare network with the commune as the unit has taken shape throughout the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. The backward situation historically left behind, where "there is no medicine in the rural areas of the frontier, and people rely on heaven when they are sick," has been fundamentally changed.

Xinjiang accounts for about one-sixth of the country's land area, but has a population of only over six million. Transportation is inconvenient, and rural areas are very dispersed. Before liberation, due to the long-term oppression of reactionary rule, rural health services were extremely backward, with almost no medical institutions, widespread diseases, and a high mortality rate. After liberation, in order to protect the health of all ethnic groups, the Party and the government established hospitals and health centers in all counties and some districts. However, due to the dispersed population, it was often inconvenient for farmers to travel tens or even hundreds of miles to see a doctor. After communization, each people's commune, based on production needs and the urgent demands of the masses, launched a large-scale campaign to develop rural health and medical services in early 1959, universally establishing small hospitals, setting up health centers in management districts, and establishing non-full-time health stations in many production teams. Maternity hospitals were also established one after another.

In developing rural medical services, each people's commune has adhered to the principle of self-reliance and diligence in running all undertakings, giving full play to the superiority of the commune's large organizational scale and abundant human and material resources, mobilizing the masses to raise funds and run things themselves, and successfully overcoming difficulties such as insufficient funds, equipment, and lack of medical personnel. Dozens of commune and management district hospitals in Turpan, Usu, and other counties used old houses as hospital sites, and beds, tables, and chairs were also made from old wood and old bed boards. Some commune hospitals in the Qapqal Xibe Autonomous County were built by cadres and the masses through voluntary labor. It generally costs only a few dozen yuan to dozens of yuan to establish a small hospital. The most lacking medical personnel were also trained through self-reliance. In addition to the dispatch of a small number of intermediate-level medical personnel by the autonomous region's health department to serve as doctors in commune hospitals, the vast majority of medical personnel in communes were trained by county hospitals to help communes. Aksu, Kashgar, Makit, and other 13 counties and cities alone have trained more than 1,000 medical personnel for the people's communes. This year, the Makit County Hospital provided intensive training for more than 80 junior medical assistants and midwives for the communes. They were all commune members selected by the communes to establish medical institutions. After a short period of training, they underwent clinical practice in the county hospital and became the backbone of rural medical work.

The newly built healthcare network of rural people's communes, with the support of the autonomous region's health department, has extensively launched disease prevention and eradication work. Through various prevention and treatment methods, many local diseases in rural areas that seriously endangered people's health have been eliminated or their harm has been reduced. After a general survey and treatment in Shache County, venereal diseases have been basically eliminated, and most cases of favus (head scab) and goiter (enlarged thyroid) have gradually recovered. Malaria, which has been prevalent in the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture for many years, has been basically eliminated. Because rural medical institutions are located in basic production units, they closely cooperate with production. Health units in Turpan arranged medical work according to the agricultural season. For example, during the autumn harvest and water conservancy construction, temporary medical stations were set up in the fields and construction sites. Medical personnel and commune members worked and treated diseases at the same time, ensuring that wherever there was labor, medicine would follow, ensuring the labor attendance rate during the busy farming season. After the establishment of health stations in production teams in Yutian, Usu, and other places, production became more convenient. Whether in the fields or at home, commune members could receive medical treatment whenever they were sick, and patients could have their illnesses cured without leaving their homes. The establishment of maternity hospitals in various places has increased the use of modern midwifery for rural women from 1.5% last year to 94%, and most of the women deliver in hospitals, greatly reducing the infant mortality rate.

    天山南北送瘟神　人病靠医不靠天
    新疆农村公社普建医疗保健网
    本报讯　新疆维吾尔自治区农村人民公社普遍办起医院、妇产院，全区四百五十一个人民公社，已经建立的公社医院、管理区卫生所、生产队保健站和各级妇产院达一千多所，拥有病床三千多张。一个以公社为单位的农村医疗保健网已在天山南北各地形成。历史上遗留下来的“边疆农村无医药，生病靠老天”的落后面貌根本改观。
    新疆约占全国土地面积的六分之一，但是人口只有六百多万，交通不便，农村非常分散。在解放前，由于反动统治的长期压榨，农村卫生事业十分落后，几乎没有什么医疗机构，疾病蔓延，死亡率很高。解放后，党和政府为了保障各族人民的健康，在所有县份和部分区设立了医院和卫生所。但是，由于居住太分散，农民看一次病往往要走几十里，甚至一、二百里，很不方便。公社化以后，各人民公社根据生产需要和群众的迫切要求，1959年初就开展大办农村卫生医疗事业，普遍建立小型医院，管理区普遍设置卫生所，许多生产队建起不脱产的保健站，妇产院也纷纷举办起来。
    各人民公社在兴办农村医疗事业中，都本着自力更生、勤俭办一切事业的原则，充分发挥了公社组织规模大和人力物力雄厚的优越性，发动群众自筹自办，顺利克服了资金、设备不足和医务人员缺乏等困难。吐鲁番、乌苏等县几十个公社和管理区的医院都利用旧房舍作院址，病床、桌椅也是用旧木料、旧床板改制成的。察布查尔锡伯自治县一些公社医院，都是由干部和群众义务劳动兴建的。一般建立一所小医院只用十数元至数十元。最缺乏的医务人员也是靠自力更生办法培养的，除自治区卫生部门调派少数中级医务人员到公社医院担任医生职务外，绝大部分公社的医务人员都是由各县的医院帮助公社培训的。仅阿克苏、喀什、麦盖提等十三个县市就为人民公社训练了一千多名医务人员。麦盖提县医院今年为公社集训的八十多名初级医士和助产士，都是各公社为建立医疗机构选送的社员，他们经过短期训练后，又在县医院进行临床实习，成为农村医务工作骨干。
    农村人民公社新建的保健网，在自治区卫生部门的支援下，广泛展开了防病灭病工作。经过多种防治，农村中不少严重危害人们健康的地方病，有的已被消灭，有的减轻了危害。莎车县经过普查和治疗，性病已基本消灭，头癞和甲状腺肿（大脖子）大部分也已逐步痊愈。伊犁哈萨克族自治州多年流行的疟疾，已基本消灭。由于农村医疗机构都设置在基层生产单位中，紧密配合了生产。吐鲁番各卫生单位根据农时安排医疗工作，如秋收和兴修水利时，便在田间和工地设临时医疗站，医务人员和社员边劳动边治病，作到了哪里有劳动，医药就跟到哪里，保证了农忙时期的劳动出勤率。于田、乌苏等地生产队保健站普遍建立起来后，更便利了生产，不管在田间和家里，社员生病随时都可得到医治，病人不出门就把病治好。各地妇产院的建立，使农村妇女用新法接生的已由去年的1．5％增加到94％，产妇大部都住院生产，大大降低了婴儿死亡率。　　　　　　　　　　（谈风）
