    We Started a Primary School for the Buyi People
    Chen Mingxue, Teacher at Azhi Private Primary School, Balai Commune, Langdai County, Guizhou Province

    To Prevent Children from Remaining Illiterate
    In 1955, I was discharged from the army and returned to my hometown, the Azhi Management District of Balai Commune, Langdai County, Guizhou Province. This is a remote village inhabited by the Buyi ethnic group. Before liberation, under the cruel rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, there wasn't a single school. Among the hundred-plus households of working people, not a single person could read or write. It was truly a "poor and blank" backward mountainous area. After liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, with the development of production, agricultural producers' cooperatives were established. However, in our Muzhe and Muyi villages, we couldn't even find a work-point recorder. The villagers used corn or knotted ropes to record work points. Seeing this, I couldn't help but think of the suffering of poor peasants without education before liberation. For example, Zhao Minggui owed the puppet government one *sheng* of "self-defense soldier rice," but the puppet *baozhang* Chen Mingxuan deliberately recorded it as seven *sheng*, and forced him to pay seven *sheng* of rice. Another example is Chen Yaoting, who asked the landlord Chen Mingsi to write an IOU for two yuan, and was charged five *jiao* for the pen and ink. These many past events made me more and more excited, and I resolved to start a school in my hometown. When I brought up the matter of starting a school to discuss with the commune members, the masses were very happy. Commune members Wang Chenggju, Wei Qixian, and others said, "Other places have schools and literate people. Mingxue, we agree with your idea to jointly run a school in our Muzhe and Muyi villages so that our children will no longer be illiterate." With the support of the masses, I immediately consulted with the Party branch secretary and commune cadres, and expressed my determination to start a school in my hometown. At that time, the secretary strongly supported and encouraged me, saying, "You were a good soldier in the army, and you are an active and leading good commune member in agricultural production. The Party believes that you will definitely be able to run the school well." Thus, under the leadership of the Party branch and with the support of the masses, the Muzhe Private Primary School was established in just one month.

    There were forty students when the school started. The school building was temporarily borrowed from the house of farmer Chen Yaoting. Without desks and benches, stones were used to prop up boards to make desks and benches. Without a blackboard, a plaque from the former landlord's house was used as a blackboard. Without textbooks, with the support of the county Bureau of Culture and Education and the district and township schools, some old textbooks were collected for the students to read. The school officially started. But soon, Chen Yaoting wanted to take the house back to receive his daughter-in-law, and the classroom became a problem again. Fearing that it would delay the students' classes, I built a thatched shed and moved my family to the thatched shed, giving up my own tile-roofed house as a classroom. At the same time, I took out my thirty-five yuan demobilization pay to buy wooden boards to make desks and benches and repair the classroom, so that the school could continue. When I gave up the house, my wife didn't understand, and she was even more unwilling to use the demobilization pay, so she snatched the money away. I had to explain to her carefully, saying, "You know, running a school is a good thing, it's beneficial to the masses, and it's right to contribute money and effort. You think, I wasn't afraid to sacrifice myself when fighting the American devils in Korea. Today, I've returned home, production in the commune is doing well, and we don't have to worry about food and clothing. If the demobilization pay given by the state isn't used for public welfare, are we going to take the capitalist road?" After I said this, although her thinking wasn't completely clear, she still let me take the money, so that the school not only had a fixed school building, but also some necessary equipment.

    Over the years, in the process of running the school, in order not to increase the burden on the masses and to make the masses slightly better off, I used my demobilization pay to cover all the school's operating expenses, except for my own meals. Although my own life was a little harder, I didn't want to add my own meals and other personal expenses to the masses. For these small matters, I constantly carried out ideological and political education on my wife. With the leadership of the Party, anything can be learned. I had never taught before, and I had no experience in running a school, but I knew that with the leadership of the Party, anything can be learned, and any difficulty can be overcome. My cultural level was very low, and I wasn't familiar with teaching skills. In the teaching process, I initially simply thought that, like in the past, I would pick up a book and teach, explain individual new words, and as long as the students could read, recognize, and speak the new words, it would be done. But the results of the test showed that half of them failed, and I was very anxious. After the Party branch learned about it, they pointed out to me that "you must study hard and humbly learn from others." So I ran to the complete primary school five or six *li* away to learn how to prepare lessons and write lesson plans, and borrowed some teaching syllabuses and reference materials such as Chinese and arithmetic to learn on my own. After a period of exploration, I gradually had a clue and could write lesson plans, prepare lessons, and teach in light of the actual situation. In teaching, if some students didn't understand Mandarin, I would translate it into our Buyi language, and the students would easily understand it. When teaching Chinese Pinyin, I initially only told the students how to pronounce and showed them how to read, but the students still didn't understand and couldn't remember it. Later, I combined it with the ethnic minority language, such as teaching "a" by reading "the 'a' in 'du a' (Buyi sound for crow)"; teaching "an" by reading "the 'an' in 'bang an' (Buyi sound for celery)". In this way, the students could understand, read correctly, and not easily forget. When teaching arithmetic, I used flowers, pebbles, and wooden sticks as teaching aids, such as teaching "12 ÷ 4", I first arranged 12 flowers and asked the students to divide them equally into 4 piles, and then explained how the quotient "3" came about. In this way, the students quickly understood and remembered it firmly. The students' academic performance also improved greatly.

    Implement the Party's Education Policy and Cultivate New Moral Qualities in Students
    In order to better implement the Party's education policy, our school also engaged in productive labor. In 1958, I and the students cultivated 1.8 *mu* of experimental fields and achieved a good harvest of 800 *jin* of rice per *mu*. Through production practice, the students developed a habit of loving labor and also enriched their knowledge. During the "small autumn harvest" in 1959, the students actively participated in the rush harvest activities in their spare time, and also rushed to harvest tung oil seeds in the rain. In just two days, they completed the task assigned by the commune. The students also used their rest time to automatically go up the mountain to pick up scattered tung oil seeds, and picked up more than 50 *dan* of raw tung oil in just over 20 days. In order not to affect the classes, when we helped the team peel tung oil seeds, we took the small blackboard with us, and taught wherever we peeled, moving the classroom to the construction site, so that learning and production were "both not delayed", and we were repeatedly praised by the township leaders and the masses.

    When I was in the army, the leaders often cared about our life and study. I thought that as a teacher, I should also care about everything about the children, care about their studies, and even more care about their lives and the growth of new moral qualities. There is a small river in front of our school. When the river rises during the rainy season, it is very dangerous for the children to cross the river. I often go to the river, carrying the students over when they go to school and carrying them back after school to prevent drowning accidents. In order to cultivate new moral qualities in the students, in addition to guiding them to actively participate in labor, I often told the students about the heroic deeds of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Korean battlefield, who were not afraid of sacrifice and bloodshed and bravely killed the enemy, and conducted communist ideological education for the students. In this way, the excellent qualities of loving labor, loving the people, and being resourceful and courageous were constantly developing among the students. Once, there was a fire in the village, and an old woman was surrounded by the raging fire, and was about to be burned to death. This was seen by two third-grade students, who bravely rushed into the fire and rescued the old woman. Their faces were burned, and their clothes were torn, but they were not bothered by this, but felt happy to have rescued the old woman. The masses unanimously said, "The good students educated by the Party are truly good heroes of the people."

    Under the leadership of the Party branch, in addition to completing the school's teaching tasks, I also tried my best to help the commune organize the accounts. Whenever the commune distributed [profits], I organized the senior students to first teach them the calculation methods, and then assigned them to various production teams to assist the masses in clearing work points. Through these activities, the relationship between the school and the masses became closer. When the school planted experimental fields and lacked cattle and farm tools, the masses actively supported us when they knew about it. When transplanting seedlings, I and the students did not know how to transplant "new-style seedlings," so the production team sent experienced farmers to guide us. During the autumn harvest, when the school's rice could not be harvested in time, the commune members helped us harvest the rice. Under the leadership of the Party branch and with the strong support of the masses, all difficult problems were solved in a timely manner. For example, in the early stage of running the school, some commune members only cared about increasing work points and did not allow their children to attend school. After the secretary and commune cadres learned about it, they patiently educated the masses at large and small meetings, so that these people allowed their children to go to school and study, and the number of students quickly increased to more than 140. When the Muzhe Private Primary School and the Azhi Complete Primary School merged, and the school expanded the school building, the masses took the initiative to contribute labor and materials to support the construction of the school. This year, they did not rest during the Spring Festival, and helped the school demolish three tile-roofed houses and move them to the new school address to build houses. Now the school is developing and consolidating day by day, and the students and the masses love this school led by the Party even more.

    Although I have done a little something for the masses and gained the trust of the masses, this is mainly due to the result of the Party's education and cultivation of me, and is due to the strong support of the masses and the help of all the teachers. Therefore, it should be attributed to the leadership of the Party, the support of the masses, and the help of the teachers. In my future work, I will always listen to the Party's words, continue to study hard, and contribute all my energy to the Party's education cause.

    我们办起了布依族人民的小学
    贵州省郎岱县巴赖公社阿志民办小学教师　陈明学
    让小孩不再当睁眼瞎
    1955年，我由志愿军复员，回到了家乡贵州省郎岱县巴赖公社阿志管理区。这是一个偏僻的布依族聚居的村寨，解放前，在国民党反动派的残酷统治下，一所学校都没有，一百多户劳动人民中，一个识字的人也找不出来，真是一个“一穷二白”落后山区。解放后，在党和毛主席的正确领导下，随着生产的发展，建立了农业生产合作社，但是我们木易和木则这两个寨子，连一个记分员都找不到，乡亲们都用苞谷子或用绳子打疙瘩记工分。我看到这种情况，就连想到解放前贫苦农民没有文化的痛苦。如赵明贵欠伪政府的一升“自卫兵食米”，被伪保长陈明选有意记成七升，结果硬逼着要去了七升米。又如陈耀廷找地主陈明思写一张二元的借条，就被他扣去了五角的笔墨钱。这许许多多的往事，使我越想越激动，决心要在本地开办学校。当我把办学校的事情提出来与社员们商量时，群众都非常高兴，社员王成举、韦起贤等说：“别的地方有了学校就有识字的人。明学，我们同意你的意见，在我们木则、木易这两寨子里合办一所学校，让我们的小孩不要再当睁眼瞎。”我得到了群众的支持，便立即找乡党支书和社干部商量。并表示了一定要在家乡办起一所学校的决心。当时支书极力支持和鼓励我说：“在部队上你是好战士，在农业生产上你积极带头是个好社员，党相信你一定能把学校办起来”。就这样在党支部的领导和群众的支持下，仅仅一个月的时间，木则民办小学就办起来了。
    开学时有四十个学生。校舍是暂时借用农民陈耀廷家的一间房子，没有桌凳就用石头垫上板子做桌凳，没有黑板就拿原来地主家的一块匾来做黑板；没有课本，在县文教局和区、乡学校的支持下，搜集了一些旧课本给学生读。学校就这样正式开课了。但是不久，陈耀廷要把房子收回去接媳妇，教室又成了问题。我怕耽误学生上课，便动手搭了间茅草棚，动员家里人搬到茅草房里去住，让出了自己的瓦房来做教室，同时又拿出我的三十五元复员费去买木板制桌凳、修理教室，使学校继续上课。在我让房子时，我的爱人思想不通，拿复员费去用时，她更是不肯，把钱抢了去。我只得好好地向她解释说：“你晓得，办学是好事，对群众有益处，出力贴钱是应该的。你想，我在朝鲜打美国鬼子，还不怕牺牲，今天回家来，社里生产搞好了，我们吃用不愁，国家给的复员费不拿来办公益事，难道要拿去走资本主义道路吗？”经我这样一说，虽然她的思想还没有彻底搞通，但还是让我把钱拿了出来，使学校不但有了固定的校舍，同时也有了一些必要的设备。
    几年来，在办学过程中，为了不给群众增加负担，让群众稍微宽裕一些，我除了吃自己的伙食外，学校的一切办公费用我都用我的复员费开支，虽然我自己生活苦一点，但我不愿把自己的伙食等个人费用加在群众身上。为了这些小事，我不断对我的爱人进行思想政治教育。有党的领导，什么事都可以学会我没有教过学，更没有办学的经验，但我知道，有党的领导，什么事都可以学会，甚么困难都是可以克服的。我的文化水平很低，教学业务又不熟，在教学过程中，开始我只简单的认为，像过去一样拿起书本教，个别生字讲一下，只要学生会读、能认、会讲生字生词便算完事。可是测验的结果有半数人不及格，我很着急。党支部知道后，便给我指出“要刻苦钻研，虚心向别人学习”，于是我就跑到五、六里远的完小去学备课，写教案，借些教学大纲和语文、算术等参考资料来自学，经过一段时间的摸索，渐渐有了头绪，能写教案、备课等，并能结合实际情况讲课。在教学中，有的学生不懂汉语，我就用我们布依族话来翻译，学生就容易懂了。在教汉语拼音的时候，开初只对学生讲如何发音，告诉学生的读法，作示范，但学生始终不懂，更记不住。后来我就结合民族语音来教，如教“a”读“独a（布依族音即乌鸦）的a”；教“an”读“棒an（布依族音即芹菜）的an”。这样学生听得懂，又读得对，也不易忘记。教算数时，我又用花、石子、木棒等做教具，如教“12÷4”，就先摆12朵花叫学生平均分成4堆，然后讲商数“3”是怎样来的。这样学生很快就懂了，记得也牢实了。学生的学习成绩也就大了。
    贯彻党的教育方针，培养学生新的道德品质
    为了很好贯彻执行党的教育方针，我们的学校也搞了生产劳动。1958年我和学生耕种了一亩八分试验田，获得了水稻亩产八百斤的丰收。通过生产实践，养成了学生爱劳动的习惯，也丰富了学生的知识。1959年“小秋收”中，学生在课余时间积极参加抢收活动，还冒雨抢收桐子，仅两天的时间，就完成了公社布置的任务。学生并利用休息的时间，自动上山去拾零星桐子，只二十多天就拣了五十多担毛桐。为了不影响上课，我们帮队里剥桐子的时候，便带着小黑板走，剥到哪里便在哪里上课，把课堂搬到了工地，使学习生产“两不误”，获得了乡领导和群众的一再表扬。
    我在部队时，首长经常关心我们的生活和学习。我联想到当老师也应该关心孩子们的一切，要关心他们的学习，更要关心他们的生活与新的道德品质的成长。我们的学校门前有条小河，雨季河水上涨的时候，孩子们经过小河是很危险的，我就经常到河边去，上学时我把学生背过来，放学后又把他们背过去，以防止学生落水事故的发生。为了培养学生新的品德，除引导他们积极参加劳动外，我常给学生谈志愿军在朝鲜战场上不怕牺牲流血，英勇杀敌的英雄事迹，对学生进行共产主义思想教育。这样，在学生中爱劳动、爱人民、机智勇敢等优良品质不断的得到成长。有一次村边失火，一个老太婆被烈火包围住，眼看快要被烧死了。这被两个三年级的学生看见了，他们就奋不顾身地钻进火海，救出了老太婆，他们的脸被烧烂了，衣服也烧破了，但他们没有为这些烦恼，却为救出了老太婆感到愉快。群众一致反映说：“党教育出来的好学生，真是人民的好英雄”。
    在党支部的领导下，我除完成学校的教学任务外，还尽量帮助社里整理账目，每当社里分配时，我便组织高年级学生，先教会他们计算方法，然后分到各个生产队协助群众清理工分。通过这些活动，学校与群众的关系更加密切了，学校种试验田时缺乏耕牛、农具，群众知道了就积极支持。插秧时，我和学生不会栽“新式秧”，生产队就派有经验的农民来指导。秋收时，学校谷子来不及割，社员们就帮助我们收谷子。在党支部的领导和群众大力支持下，一切困难问题都得到了及时的解决，如办学初期，个别社员只顾增加工分，不让自己的子女上学，支书及社干部知道后，就在大小会上耐心的教育群众，使这些人都让子女上学读书，学生人数很快地增加到一百四十多人。在木则民办小学与阿志完全小学合并，学校扩建校舍时，群众又主动献工献料，支援学校的建设。今年过春节他们也不休息，帮助学校拆了三间瓦房，把它搬到新校地址来盖房子。现在学校一天天更发展巩固了，学生和群众也更爱这所党领导办起来的学校。
    我虽然为群众做了一点事，获得了群众的信任，但这主要是由于党对我的教育和培养的结果，是群众的大力支持和全体老师的帮助得来的，因此应归功于党的领导，归功于群众的支持和老师们的帮助。我要在今后的工作中，永远听党的话，继续努力学习，为党的教育事业贡献出我全部的精力。
