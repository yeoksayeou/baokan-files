Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 10th June: A total of 1.3 million French civil servants held a 24-hour general strike today, demanding a 3% wage increase and a higher minimum wage.

	The strike has paralyzed public services throughout France. Flights and shipping from Paris airports have been halted, post offices closed, and telephone services disrupted.

	In Paris, 90% of sanitation workers participated in the strike, as did 80% of postal and telecommunications workers, and the majority of market workers. Only a very small number of people in administrative departments were present to deal with urgent work. In the education sector, professors and teachers, with the exception of those supervising examinations, all participated in the strike. Representatives of Parisian civil servants' unions held a large-scale demonstration this morning in front of the French Ministry of Finance building. Demonstrators held signs and banners with slogans such as: "Increase our wages," "Strive for unified action," "All civil servants demand satisfaction of their rights, increase wages and subsidies." The areas surrounding the demonstration were filled with police forces and so-called "Republican Security Companies." Police helicopters constantly circled over the city center.

	Most Parisian newspapers today published commentaries on the general strike of 1.3 million civil servants. "L'Humanité" pointed out that the general strike of civil servants has received the firm support of all workers. The newspaper demanded that the government cut military spending and stop the colonial war in Algeria, using the money saved to meet the legitimate demands of civil servants.

	"Le Parisien Libéré" expressed concern about the impact of the strike. It said that the government should hear the warnings contained in these strikes. It pointed out that minimizing the significance of this strike would be "dangerous."

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 10th June: French metallurgical workers are rising up in response to their union's call to fight for workers' rights. The Federation of Metalworkers, affiliated with the General Confederation of Labour (CGT), issued a statement saying, "Hundreds of thousands of metalworkers have already taken action."

	The statement said: "This day of demands, organized under the call of the CGT, is a large-scale day of action held in workplaces by many unions affiliated with the CGT, the French Confederation of Christian Workers (CFTC), the Workers' Force General Confederation (CGT-FO), and several other unions." The statement continued: "During the preparation for this national day of action, demands in the Paris region, Seine-Maritime, Nord, and other areas have already yielded results. To achieve more results, actions in factories are continuing and strengthening in ever-closer solidarity."

	"L'Humanité" published an article commenting on this important "day of action," saying: A notable fact is that there are many street parades and demonstrations, and the scale of the parades and rallies is enormous.

    一百三十万人要求增加工资
    法国公务人员总罢工
    新华社巴黎10日电　法国全国一百三十万公务人员今天举行二十四小时总罢工，要求增加工资3％和提高最低工资。
    这次罢工使全法国的公共机关都处于瘫痪状态。从巴黎机场起飞的飞机和航运停止了，邮局关门，电话中断。
    巴黎90％的清洁工人参加了罢工，80％的邮电职工和大多数菜市工人也参加了罢工。行政部门只有极少数的人在那里应付紧急工作，教育部门除监考的人全部工作以外，教授和教员都参加罢教。巴黎公务人员工会的代表今天上午在法国财政部大楼门前举行了大规模的示威。示威者举着的标语和口号牌上写着：“提高我们的工资”，“争取统一行动”，“全体公务人员要求满足自己的权利，增加工资和补助金”。在举行示威地区的四周，满布了警察部队和所谓“共和国保安队”的部队。警察的直升飞机不断在市中心上空盘旋。
    巴黎大部分报纸今天都对一百三十万公务人员大罢工一事发表评论。“人道报”指出，公务人员的总罢工得到了所有工人的坚决支持。这家报纸要求政府削减军事费用和停止在阿尔及利亚进行的殖民战争，把节省下来的钱用来满足公务人员的正当要求。
    “解放了的巴黎人报”对罢工的影响表示不安。它说，政府应该听见这些罢工所包含的警告。它指出，缩小这次罢工意义将是“危险的”。
    新华社巴黎10日电　法国冶金工人群起响应他们的工会关于争取工人权利的号召。隶属法国总工会的五金工人联合会发表公报说：“已经有几十万冶金工人行动起来了。”
    公报说：“在法国总工会号召下组织的这次权利要求日，是隶属法国总工会、天主教工人联合会、工人力量总工会以及另外几个工会的许多工会联合在工作场所举行的一次规模巨大的行动日。”公报接着说：“在这次全国行动日的准备期间，巴黎区、塞纳海滨省、诺尔省等地的权利要求已经取得成果。“为了争取更多的成果，工厂里的行动正在继续，并且在日益紧密的团结中不断加强。”
    “人道报”发表文章，评论这次重要的“行动日”说：显著的事实是，在大街上，游行示威很多，游行和集会的规模巨大。
