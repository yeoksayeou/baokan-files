Xinhua News Agency, June 19th: The capital's literary and art circles held a symposium on June 18th against American imperialism's aggression, resolutely liberating Taiwan, and defending world peace.

The meeting was presided over by Zhou Yang, Vice Chairman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles.

Zhou Yang, Vice Chairman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, pointed out at the meeting that opposing American imperialism is the common task of the people of the world and the Chinese people, and it is also the most important task of the literary and art circles at present. Now, the people of the world have awakened, and the struggle against American imperialism will surely achieve final victory. Zhou Yang emphasized that modern revisionism shamelessly defends imperialist aggression, but in the face of the facts, their fallacies have been shattered. Zhou Yang said that the literary and art circles should use various weapons to expose American imperialism and support the struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism.

Mao Dun, Vice Chairman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, said in his speech that the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front used artillery fire to welcome and send off Eisenhower, this "God of Plague." Our literary and art circles should use pens, brushes, musical instruments, dances and other literary and artistic weapons to expose and encircle this "God of Plague."

Writer Lao She said, we will not allow American imperialism to occupy Taiwan, nor will we allow it to create two Chinas. We have the determination to oppose American imperialism and the experience to oppose American imperialism. We will certainly be able to defeat it. The people of the world unite, and they will surely achieve victory.

Playwright Tian Han said that in the current upsurge of the people of the world against American imperialism, our drama workers must step forward, take up the weapon of drama, and go to the forefront of anti-Americanism and support the national and democratic struggles of various countries.

Dramatist Mei Lanfang said that now that Eisenhower has arrived in Taiwan, the compatriots in Taiwan must understand that his intentions are not good. All patriotic Chinese should unite and wage a resolute struggle against American imperialism.

Musician Ma Sicong said that our music is our weapon. We must, like the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front, bomb hard, bomb, bomb, and never stop until we drive away American imperialism.

Painter Wu Zuoren said that the people of Asia gave war-mongering ringleader Eisenhower a resounding slap in the face with earth-shattering roars. The best way to deal with the imperialist elements who are frantically preparing for war is for hundreds of millions of people to unite and fight against them.

Xu Guangping, Cai Chusheng, Liu Kaiqu, Zhao Shuli, Cai Ruohong, Hu Guogang and other figures from literary and art circles also spoke at the meeting.
