    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 31st: The broad masses of Soviet working people continue to hold meetings or write letters to newspapers, expressing unanimous agreement with Khrushchev's speech at the All-Union Conference of Advanced Workers in the Competition for the Title of Communist Labor Teams and Shock Workers. They sternly warn the American imperialists: If they continue to play with fire, they will face complete destruction.

    Blyumov, a worker at the Moscow Grinding Machine Factory, pointed out at a factory meeting that Khrushchev, in his speech, once again warned the adventurers and provocateurs on behalf of the Soviet people. We believe that any attempt by adventurers to disrupt our peaceful life will suffer a shameful defeat like the American spy plane.

    At a meeting held on the 30th at the Moscow Automobile and Tractor Electrical Equipment Factory, employees expressed unanimous agreement with the Soviet government's stance against American aggressors. Production team leader Shashero said: Our people are peace-loving, but we will not allow anyone to infringe upon our motherland. Speakers at the meeting unanimously pointed out that American aggressors should know that the Soviet Union has never shown weakness to those who threaten us. It is always ready to defend its just cause.

    Abshin, a rolling machine worker at the Kiev Ukrainian Cable Factory, said at a meeting that we wholeheartedly agree with the Leninist policy pursued by the Soviet government to defend the sovereignty of the motherland and strengthen world peace. The spy flights of the American imperialist aerial bandits cannot frighten the Soviet people. To counter the aggressors' provocations, we will unite more closely around the Communist Party and continue to strengthen the power of the Soviet motherland through selfless labor.

    Stronnikova, a female worker at the Krupskaya Textile Factory in Ivanovo, and Korolev, the captain of a Communist Labor Team, published an article in the "Soviet Russia" newspaper on the 31st, saying: The American government has used every means to try to place us in an unequal position at the summit conference, but the imperialists across the ocean have miscalculated. We are not afraid of any threats, we have powerful weapons to defend the Soviet regime, and we have ways to punish any aggressor. We will continue to strengthen the cause of peace with creative labor. Ibragim, the chairman of a collective farm in Tajikistan, said: American imperialists should not even think of making our great socialist country submit; it was impossible in the past, and it is still impossible now. He pointed out that the Soviet people are building a life that was previously only imagined in myths. They will work tirelessly to strengthen peace and the power of socialist countries.

    Khlopkova, a female worker at the Vladimir Tractor Factory, said that war instigators cannot stop us from moving forward. We are moving towards the victory of communist labor.

    Soviet Air Force Major and Hero of the Soviet Union Zakharov published an article in the "Red Star" newspaper on the 31st, saying that American imperialists are pursuing a policy of promoting the Cold War and the arms race. They have obviously forgotten the lessons of World War II, but if necessary, we will remind them. The Soviet army is powerful and invincible, and we will not allow anyone to carry out espionage and sabotage activities against our country, or use threats, and will not allow any infringement on our sacred borders. If the hotheads in the United States try to impose war on us, we will give them a resolute rebuff. He emphasized that the Soviet army, equipped with top-notch military technology, is capable of annihilating any invading aggressor.

    基辅乌克兰电缆工厂的辗压机工阿布申在集会上说，我们衷心地赞同苏联政府执行的保卫祖国主权和加强世界和平的列宁的政策。美帝国主义者空中强盗的间谍飞行吓不倒苏联人民。为了回击侵略者的挑衅，我们将更加紧密地团结在共产党的周围，将继续以忘我的劳动来加强苏维埃祖国的威力。
