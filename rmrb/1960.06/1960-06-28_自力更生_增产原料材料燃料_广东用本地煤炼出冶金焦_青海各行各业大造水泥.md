Guangzhou, June 27th (By Our Newspaper) – A major technical innovation in Guangdong Province’s metallurgical industry – using local coal to produce coke – has been promoted throughout the province and has achieved good results. This has not only shattered the past superstitious belief that "Guangdong coal cannot be used to make coke," but also provides extremely important conditions for changing the unreasonable situation of transporting coal from the north to the south and for developing Guangdong's steel industry at high speed.

In the past, because Guangdong's coking coal production was relatively small, and the ash and sulfur content of raw coal were generally high, and the bonding properties were also relatively poor, people always believed that Guangdong coal could not be used to make coke. The coke needed was made from northern coal produced in Hegang, Pingdingshan, Fengfeng and other places. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, workers in various places emancipated their minds, broke superstitions, and began to use indigenous methods to produce coke from Guangdong coal to supply the many small blast furnaces that were smelting iron. However, due to a lack of experience and the necessary coal washing, crushing, and other equipment, the technology was not fully mastered at that time. With the development of industry and agriculture in various places, the supply of northern coal could no longer meet Guangdong's coking needs. On the other hand, Guangdong's coal production has greatly developed in recent years, and output has continued to rise. Therefore, using local coal to make coke has become a key issue in developing Guangdong's metallurgical industry in a faster, better, and more economical way.

In response to this situation, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee decided to organize forces to overcome this key. After a small-scale test of using Guangdong coal to make coke, the Provincial Metallurgical Industry Department assisted the Shaoguan Hongqi Steel Plant in conducting an industrial production test on a simple No. 2 coking furnace in February this year. During the test, seventeen coal blending schemes were made using eleven coal types, and corresponding technical measures were taken to address the characteristics of high ash and sulfur content in the raw coal. Finally, nine coal blending schemes including bituminous coal and anthracite coal produced high-quality metallurgical coke with dense coking, strong and hard, proving that Guangdong coal can not only be used to make coke, but some coal has good coking performance, high coking rate, and normal coking time, exceeding the requirements of the original coking furnace coking time.

After gaining experience in using Guangdong coal to make coke through testing, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee immediately decided to promote it as an important advanced experience throughout the province. Metallurgical units in various parts of the province organized visits and studies, and used indigenous methods and self-reliance to add necessary equipment such as coal washing and crushing, and quickly put them into production. According to statistics from relevant departments, all of the dozens of simple No. 2 coking furnaces in the province have successfully used Guangdong coal to produce metallurgical coke for blast furnaces and chemical steel furnaces. The 55-cubic-meter blast furnaces of Guangzhou Iron and Steel Plant and "August 1st" Iron and Steel Plant, the largest in Guangdong Province, also used coke made from Guangdong coal. In the past few months, these coking furnaces have been able to use all or part of Guangdong coal for coking, depending on the coal supply situation.

Xining, June 27th (By Our Newspaper) – The Qinghai Provincial Party Committee issued a call to the province, requiring the vigorous production of cement to replace steel and wood. According to incomplete statistics, more than 30 "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups" cement plants have been established throughout the province, and more than 30 are being planned and built. Due to the widespread cement production, cement production has been increasing month by month and ten days by ten days. The province's daily cement output in the first ten days of June increased by 47.65% compared with the entire month of May, and in the middle ten days of June it increased by 46% compared with the first ten days.

In April, the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee discussed and arranged a preliminary plan for cement production in 1960. According to this plan, cement plants will be established in all departments, bureaus, prefectures, and counties; organs, factories, mines, and people's communes should vigorously establish cement plants if conditions permit. The Provincial Party Committee emphasized that there are many benefits to various industries vigorously producing cement. First, if prefectures and counties establish cement plants, they can avoid long-distance transportation of materials and greatly save transportation capacity; second, Qinghai Province has extremely rich resources for developing the cement industry, and using indigenous methods can achieve results in a short period of time; third, it can save a lot of steel and wood.

Then, a mass movement in which the whole party was mobilized, and the whole people took action, to vigorously engage in cement production, was vigorously launched throughout Qinghai Province. The construction department used "waste materials" such as slag and furnace slag from industrial production to vigorously produce slag cement and furnace slag cement suitable for general building construction. Now, from the company to the work area and section, small cement plants are being built. All seven construction companies in the Xining area have universally established factories producing cement using indigenous methods. Kilns for firing this cement can be seen everywhere next to scaffolding and bridge construction sites. Workers in the iron and steel, brick and tile, glass, and ceramic industries have vigorously engaged in diversified operations, using the slag and furnace slag from their factories to produce cement. Several larger cement plants have either been completed or are under construction or are being actively planned.

In the movement to vigorously produce cement, workers vigorously carried out technical revolutions, fiercely attacked the technical and equipment barriers of cement production, and continuously improved the cement's grade and output. The workers of the Xining Railway Bureau Cement Plant, which originally had simple equipment and could only produce 200-grade cement, with the heroic spirit of "having high-grade ideas can produce high-grade cement," vigorously carried out technical innovations, and gradually manufactured mechanized and semi-mechanized equipment combining indigenous and foreign methods in the main links of crushing, balling, lifting, and forging, replacing manual operations. The Party branch of this factory also mobilized workers to break through the "four barriers" of ball milling, forging, machinery, and experimentation, and began to produce high-grade cement that can be used to build bridges and tunnels in large quantities. The Qinghai Provincial Party Committee held an on-site meeting at this factory to promote their experience. Workers in cement plants across the country immediately launched a upsurge in learning from, catching up with, and surpassing the Xining Railway Bureau Cement Plant. Various places also relied on their own efforts to manufacture equipment such as ball mills and crushers, and promoted the use of indigenous methods that were appropriate to local conditions, such as using water mills for crushing and wind blowing instead of sieves, to solve the difficulties of insufficient equipment and produce cement in large quantities.

    自力更生  增产原料材料燃料
    广东用本地煤炼出冶金焦
    青海各行各业大造水泥
    本报广州27日电　广东省冶炼工业中的一项重大技术革新——用本省煤来炼焦已经在全省范围内推广，并获得了良好的效果。这不仅打破了过去那种“广东煤无法炼焦”的迷信思想，而且对改变北煤南运的不合理状况和高速度发展广东钢铁工业提供了极其重要的条件。
    过去由于广东焦煤产量比较少，而且原煤的灰分和含硫分一般比较高，粘结性也比较差，因此，人们一向认为广东煤不能炼焦，所需的焦炭都是用鹤岗、平顶山、峰峰等地所产的北方煤来炼成的。在1958年大跃进中，各地职工解放思想，破除迷信，开始用广东煤土法炼焦，以供应大炼钢铁时成群小高炉炼铁的需要。但当时由于缺乏经验，和缺少必要的洗煤、破碎等设备，因此在技术上还没有完全过关。随着各地工农业发展，北方煤的供应已经不能满足广东炼焦的需要；另一方面，这几年广东煤炭生产有了很大发展，产量不断上升，因而用本地煤来炼焦便成为多快好省地发展广东冶炼工业的一个关键问题。
    针对这个情况，中共广东省委决定组织力量攻破这一关键。省冶金工业厅在经过用广东煤炼焦的小型试验后，今年2月间，协助韶关红旗钢铁厂在简易二号炼焦炉上进行工业性生产试验。试验中曾用十一个煤种作出了十七个配煤方案，并针对原煤含灰分和含硫分较高的特点，采取了相应的技术措施，终于有九个包括烟煤和无烟煤的配煤方案炼出了结焦细密、强度坚硬的优质冶金焦，证明了广东煤不仅能炼焦，而且有些煤的结焦性能良好，结焦率较高，结焦时间也正常，并超过了原焦炉结焦时间的要求。
    在经过试验获得用广东煤炼焦的经验后，中共广东省委立即决定作为一项重要先进经验在全省范围内推广。省内各地的冶炼单位纷纷组织参观学习，并用土法上马、自力更生的办法增加洗煤、破碎等必要的设备，迅速投入了生产。据有关部门统计，全省现有的几十个简易二号焦炉已经全部成功地用广东煤炼出了供应高炉和化钢炉用的冶金焦。广东省最大的广州钢铁厂和“八一”钢铁厂的五十五立方米高炉，也用上了广东煤炼的焦。几个月来，这些炼焦炉都已做到了根据煤的供应情况，全部或部分地用广东煤来炼焦。
    本报西宁27日电　中共青海省委向全省发出号召，要求大造水泥，用水泥代替钢材、木料。据不完全统计，目前全省已办起“小土群”“小洋群”水泥厂三十多个，正在筹建和兴建的有三十多个。由于水泥生产遍地开花，因而水泥产量逐月、逐旬增长。全省水泥日产量6月上旬比5月全月增长47．65％，6月中旬又比上旬增长46％。
    4月份，中共青海省委讨论和安排了1960年水泥生产的初步规划，按照这个规划，各厅、局及各州、县都将建立水泥厂；机关、厂矿企业以及人民公社，凡有条件的都要大办水泥厂。省委强调指出，各行各业大造水泥的好处很多。一、州、县都办起水泥厂，可以避免远道运输材料，大大节省运输力；二、青海省发展水泥工业的资源异常丰富，采取土法上马的办法，短期内就能收到效果；三、可以节省大量钢材、木材。
    接着，一个全党动员、全民动手，大搞水泥生产的群众运动，就在青海省各地蓬勃展开。建筑部门利用工业生产中的矿渣、炉渣等“废料”，大造适用于一般房屋建筑的矿渣、炉渣水泥。现在，从公司到工区、工段，都在兴建小型水泥厂。西宁地区的七个建筑公司都已普遍建立起土法生产水泥的工厂。在脚手架旁、桥梁工地上，到处可以看到烧制这种水泥的土窑。钢铁、砖瓦、玻璃、陶瓷等行业的职工，大搞多种经营，利用本厂的矿渣、炉渣等生产水泥。几个规模较大的水泥厂有的已经建成，有的也正在加紧施工或积极筹建。
    在大搞水泥生产运动中，职工们大闹技术革命，猛攻水泥生产的技术关、设备关，不断提高水泥的标号和产量。原来设备简陋、只能生产二百号水泥的西宁铁路局水泥厂的职工们，以“有高标号思想，就能生产高标号水泥”的豪迈气概，大搞技术革新，在粉碎、成球、提升、锻烧等主要环节，逐步制造出土洋结合的机械化、半机械化设备，代替了手工操作。这个厂的党支部还发动职工突破了球磨、锻烧、机械、实验“四关”，开始大量生产修建桥梁、隧道都能使用的高标号水泥。中共青海省委在这个厂召开现场会议，推广了他们的经验。各地水泥厂职工立即掀起了一个学、赶、超西宁铁路局水泥厂的热潮。各地还自力更生制造球磨机、粉碎机等设备，推广利用水磨粉碎、风吹代替箩筛等因地制宜的土办法，解决设备不足的困难，大量生产水泥。
