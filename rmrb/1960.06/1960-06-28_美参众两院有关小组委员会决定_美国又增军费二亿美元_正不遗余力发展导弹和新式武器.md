    US Senate and House Subcommittees Decide
    US Military Spending Increased by $200 Million Again
    Spare No Effort in Developing Missiles and New Weapons
    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 27th—News: The relevant subcommittees of the US Senate and House of Representatives held a secret joint meeting on the 25th, deciding to allocate an additional $200 million "to accelerate the modernization of (US) Army combat equipment."
    This joint meeting was convened to coordinate the opinions of the US Senate and House of Representatives on the huge military budget of $40.05 billion for the fiscal year beginning July 1st in the United States. A spokesman said after the meeting that it was decided to increase the $1.337 billion allocation specifically requested by Eisenhower to modernize the US military by $200 million. This extra $200 million will be used to produce small nuclear weapons, new rifles, new tanks and other equipment.
    According to other reports, the United States is actively developing missiles at all costs and using missiles to strengthen the equipment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's aggressive forces. "New York Times" chief foreign correspondent, Sulzberger, revealed on the 25th that the United States is vigorously promoting its "Polaris" missile program within the North Atlantic Group. He said that the "ultimate goal of this plan is to set up 300 'Polaris' solid-fuel medium-range ballistic missiles that do not require fixed locations in Europe" to strengthen the "attack power of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." US Secretary of Defense Gates had already put forward the initial proposal for this plan when he attended the meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council held in Paris in April, and emphasized that "Polaris" missiles can be set up on mobile launch bases such as railway vehicles or trucks. In addition, the American "Army, Navy and Air Force Magazine" recently revealed that the US Army and Air Force authorities suggested using the solid-fuel American "Pershing" missile as the "standard weapon" to arm Western Europe.
    At the same time, the United States has stepped up a series of missile tests. US officials boasted that one "Polaris" missile each, test-fired from an underground launch tube and a naval vessel on the 23rd, had been "successful." The US Air Force then test-fired a "Titan" intercontinental ballistic missile for the sixth time at Cape Canaveral on the 24th. The US Air Force also announced that it was preparing to begin testing the longer-range "Titan-J" intercontinental missile soon.

    美参众两院有关小组委员会决定
    美国又增军费二亿美元
    正不遗余力发展导弹和新式武器
    新华社27日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国会参、众两院有关小组委员会25日秘密举行了联席会议，决定增拨二亿美元“以加速（美国）陆军作战装备的现代化”。
    这次联席会议是为了协调美国参议院和众议院对美国从7月1日开始的财政年度总数达四百零五亿美元的庞大的军事预算的意见而召开的。会后一个发言人说，会议决定把艾森豪威尔专门为使美国军队现代化而要求的十三亿三千七百万美元的拨款增加两亿美元。这笔额外的二亿美元将用来生产小型核武器、新型步枪、新式坦克和其他装备。
    另据报道，美国正不遗余力地积极发展导弹，并用导弹来加强北大西洋公约侵略集团军队的装备。“纽约时报”首席驻外记者苏兹贝格25日透露，美国正在北大西洋集团中大力推行它的“北极星”式导弹计划。他说，这个计划“最终的目的是要在欧洲设置三百枚不需要固定场所的‘北极星’式固体燃料的中程弹道导弹”以加强“北大西洋公约组织的攻击力量”。美国国防部长盖茨4月出席北大西洋公约组织理事会在巴黎举行的会议时早已提出了这个计划的初步建议，并强调“北极星”式导弹可以设置在铁路车辆或卡车之类的机动发射基地上。此外美国“陆海空军杂志”最近透露，美国陆军和空军当局建议把使用固体燃料的美国“潘兴”式导弹作为武装西欧的“标准武器”。
    同时，美国加紧进行了一连串的导弹试验。美国官员吹嘘说，23日分别从地下发射管和海船上试射的“北极星”式导弹各一枚已获得“成功”。美国空军24日接着在卡纳维拉尔角第六次试射“大力神”式洲际弹道导弹。美国空军还宣布，准备不久就开始试验射程更远的
  “大力神—J”式洲际导弹。
