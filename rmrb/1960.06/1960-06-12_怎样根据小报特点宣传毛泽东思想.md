How to Propagandize Mao Zedong Thought Based on the Characteristics of Small Newspapers
Representative of Mindong Daily, Fujian Province, Li Yude

I, representing Mindong Daily of Fujian Province, will report on how we propagandize Mao Zedong Thought based on the characteristics of small newspapers. Over the eight years since its founding, under the leadership of the CPC Fuan Prefectural Committee, with the support of a broad network of correspondents and the efforts of all employees of the newspaper, the political quality of the newspaper has significantly improved with the continuous development of the situation. Readers enjoy reading Mindong Daily; some compare the newspaper to a "close friend," and grassroots organizations even regard the newspaper's editorials and news as teaching materials for propaganda among the masses. The newspaper plays the role of "organizing, encouraging, inspiring, criticizing, and promoting" in practical work.

Our newspaper propaganda over the past two years can be summarized in the following phrases: one red line, five methods, and three guarantees.

One Red Line

Our propaganda over the past two years has been permeated by a clear red line, which is to propagandize Mao Zedong Thought in conjunction with the central tasks of the Party in various periods. We use this fundamental thought to arm the millions of people in Mindong, and to strive to complete the central tasks of the Party in various periods and to realize the Party's general line of building socialism, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune!

Some people describe the Mindong area as "high mountains, cold water, barren land, and poor people." The following poem once appeared on the Liangting Pavilion on the high mountains of Shouning: "The mountains are high and the ridges are large, climbing is frightening, leaving Shouning, I never want to think about it." Some people are not firm in their revolutionary will; they do not see the strong revolutionary nature of the Mindong masses, and they do not see that this revolutionary nature is the main driving force for changing the backward face of Mindong. This kind of regional determinism seriously shackles people's subjective initiative. In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, many miracles occurred. Mindong, which had always been backward, won first place in the province for early rice yields, and continuously jumped to the upper reaches of the province in the battle for steel. In particular, the smallest and poorest counties, Zhouning and Shouning, won the upper reaches of the province in steel production. How should we publicize this moving miracle? The prefectural committee instructed us: We must take this opportunity to greatly enhance the ambition of the people of Mindong and make a big splash. We studied Chairman Mao's works, and with Chairman Mao's brilliant assertions that "poverty gives rise to the desire for change, to work, to revolution" and "a blank sheet of paper is good for drawing the newest and most beautiful pictures," we enthusiastically reported this major victory. We organized a large special page with the title: "Cold Water Only Fears a Hot Heart, High Mountains Cannot Match High Enthusiasm, Poor People and Poor Land Must Revolutionize, The Red Flag of First Place in the Province Flies." It emphasized that precisely because Mindong is particularly poor, the people, under the leadership of the Party, are full of enthusiasm and high morale. This is the decisive factor in changing the face of poverty. This propaganda played a strong mobilizing role, and the slogan "The People of Mindong Wield Colorful Pens, Drawing New Pictures in the Poor White Mountain Areas" penetrated the hearts of the people. Inspired by such slogans from the Party and the newspaper, the members of the Fushan Brigade in Ningde were greatly motivated and caught up with the rich teams in one year. Another poem appeared on Liangting Pavilion in Shouning Mountain: "The mountains are high and the ridges are large, we are not afraid, to build a new Shouning, we must green the barren mountains."

Chairman Mao taught us: "A spirit can be boosted but not deflated," and instructed us to be good at identifying the wind direction and grasping the mainstream. We resolutely implemented this instruction. During the rural rectification and accounting last year, right-leaning opportunists and some wealthy middle peasants stirred up an evil wind, attacking the Party's general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune. Our newspaper then inserted red flags, commended advanced elements, and greatly boosted morale. In that year, 159 articles reporting on advanced figures were published in the top positions of the first and second pages of the newspaper and in important sections, and 189 advanced units were commended. Concrete examples were used to publicize the superiority of the People's Commune and the correctness of the general line and the Great Leap Forward. This greatly boosted the morale of the masses and defended the three red flags. The members and cadres of the Fengyu Brigade in Luoyuan praised the newspaper during this period, saying: "Reading the newspaper every day is hot, it is really giving us courage." In May and June, some people doubted the possibility of thousand-jin rice and ten-thousand-jin sweet potatoes. According to the prefectural committee's instruction to "organize competitions and break the dull atmosphere," we reported the news of the thousand-jin rice and ten-thousand-jin sweet potato competition in Shouning County, and published articles such as "On the Summer Situation" and "Great Efforts in Thousand-Jin Rice and Ten-Thousand-Jin Sweet Potatoes are Advantageous," and also reported the typical example of the Hantou Production Team in Shouning, where the yield per mu was a thousand jin despite the high mountains and cold water, promoting the agricultural competition throughout the entire district. When some people attacked activists, we used nearly a full page to report on Chen Lansheng, the production team leader who worked well, labored well, and loved the People's Commune, making the grassroots cadres feel proud.

In the early spring of this year, in the technical revolution movement, we focused on publicizing Chairman Mao's teaching that the working people are the most intelligent, and organized six special pages, such as "Scientific Achievements from Production Practice, The Working People are the Most Intelligent" and "Commune Members Have Great Ambitions, Riding the Scientific Thousand-Li Horse," and used a lot of space to report on mass scientific research achievements, and in the editorial "Labor, Practice, Science" elaborated on the principle that science comes from practice and the working people are the most intelligent. After studying these reports and editorials, more than 70 technicians organized by the Wuliyang and other communes in Ningde County broke superstitions, liberated their minds, and established four automated factories. Fujian Daily also made a special report and reprinted the editorial "Labor, Practice, Science."

After the technical revolution was launched, some people thought that it would be a great success if a few processes were reformed, and they could be satisfied. According to Chairman Mao's principle that "contradictions constantly appear and are constantly resolved, which is the dialectical law of the development of things," we promptly criticized this theory of the end of revolution, and combined with the specific example of the Luoyuan Agricultural Machinery Factory, pointed out that as some manual operations are changed to machine operations, new imbalances have appeared, and labor organization, quotas, etc. must be changed accordingly, so as to continuously improve productivity.

Because we always pay attention to combining the central tasks with the propaganda of Mao Zedong Thought, this greatly improves the ideological nature of the newspaper.

Five Methods

According to the Party's instructions on propaganda work, we use the local farmers' experience to make detailed analysis to the farmers. At the same time, we grasp the local characteristics, adopt forms that the masses like to see and hear, and conduct popular propaganda through five methods.

First, use theoretical viewpoints to command factual materials and reveal the essential meaning of things. In the spring of 1959, there was a lot of rain in Mindong, and spring farming was very urgent, and many tasks were stopped. According to the prefectural committee's instructions to use the favorable side of the spring rain, and studying Chairman Mao's principle that good things and bad things can be transformed into each other, we published a report under the headline "Use the Favorable Side of the Spring Rain to Limit its Unfavorable Side," reporting on one area using the spring rain and large streams to float timber, and another place burning grass and wood ash indoors, and also matched a short essay: "Advantageous and Disadvantageous" dialectically explaining the principle of using spring rain to serve the people. A farmer who was afraid of too much spring rain said after reading the newspaper: "I understand this, and I will quickly find a way to control the rain." This raised a dynamic piece of news to a theoretical height.

Second, use lively people, lively events, and lively truths to discuss the imaginary with the real and to promote the real with the imaginary. Farmers are easy to accept image education, but they cannot just list some specific examples, but should follow the law of the development of things, grasp the most typical facts, and promote them to a theoretical height for propaganda, so that they have a strong persuasive power. For example, Qiongse in Zhouning County was originally in very unfavorable conditions, and the masses said that there were three pests: animal pests, barren land, and few people. However, the masses here made great ambitions, organized forces to carry out a large encirclement and suppression to eliminate animal pests; built water conservancy projects to improve the soil, and changed the barren land, and achieved a great harvest. We reported this fact with the idea that the masses have great enthusiasm and Qiongse has become rich. This gives readers a clear conclusion: enthusiasm is the main factor in promoting the transformation from backward to advanced.

Third, establish opposites, conduct comparative reports, and reveal the essence of things. We once published a comparative report of two communes. The two communes had the same conditions, but the yield differed by more than 20%. On the surface, it was because of differences in measures: one commune resolutely implemented close planting, and the other commune relaxed close planting. So, is it simply a difference in technical measures? The report further explored the reasons: It turned out that one commune was striving to be the best; the other commune was content to be in the middle. We used the following title in the report: "A Truth Proved by a Harvest," which shows that the increase in production does not depend on the quality of the conditions, but on whether or not to strive for the top.

Fourth, use mass language that is easy to understand, so that people can understand it at a glance and never forget it. For example: use "pulling an ox must pull the ox's nose" to illustrate that work must grasp the key; use "where there is a spear, there must be a shield" to illustrate that there is a way to deal with difficulties; use "a golden phoenix flies out of a poor mountain" to compare the fact that miracles can be created in places with poor conditions, and use "sharpening a knife does not delay cutting firewood" to illustrate the principle that the technical revolution does not delay production. For example, in the newsletter "Mountain Area Top Scholar" describing the enthusiasm of the members of the Hantou Production Team in Shouning, there is a passage: "This mountain village, where the sun comes out late and sets early, has always been called a 'black hole' and a 'coffin hole' in the past. It was so poor that it could not bleed when the meat was cut, it could not lift its head, and it could not speak loudly... With the leadership of the Party, everyone is someone who can move the ladder, and I dare to go to the sky, determined to use my own hands to repair the earth." These languages are relatively vivid, lively, and easy to understand, and have a profound impact on the masses. In many places, our editorials are used as teaching materials and report content for civil schools.

Fifth, put forward some slogans and titles with strong motivation and use mountain songs to publicize Mao Zedong Thought. For example, we have used some of the following headlines: "High Speed Forces Out Great Wisdom and Great Courage," "Develop Subjective Initiative, Turn All Difficulties into Ashes," "Every Industry Has Real Knowledge, Every Line Produces Local Experts," etc. The masses often use the titles from our newspapers as slogans. We seize the characteristics of the Mindong masses' love for mountain songs, and consciously use mountain songs to publicize Mao Zedong Thought and guide work. For example, a mountain song writes:

Mao Zedong's works are a magic weapon, arming the mind and raising awareness,
Identify the direction in the waves and fog, and rely on it to build the motherland.
With reliance, high morale, dare to pick the sun as a ball and throw it,
A hundred-foot deep ravine can be crossed, and needles can be fished out of the sea.
The newspaper has mountain songs every day, every page has mountain songs, and the titles are mountain songs. Since the Great Leap Forward, many high-quality mountain songs have been published. For example, "Red Flag Ballads" selected six folk songs from Fujian, four of which were published in Mindong Daily. The farmer Lin Xiaowei's mountain song "Small Peasant Economy" and another mountain song "Singing to the Moon" published in this newspaper were also well received.

Three Guarantees

Combining practical work to publicize Mao Zedong Thought is a serious political task of the newspaper. To publicize it well, there must be the following three guarantees:

First, absolutely obey the leadership of the Party. Wherever the Party committee points, we rush to it. Generally, the report was published on the second or third day after the prefectural committee issued instructions. The secretary of the prefectural committee often gives us ideas and talks about intentions. All the more outstanding reports in our newspaper were proposed by the prefectural committee. This is an important guarantee for our propaganda of Mao Zedong Thought.

Second, implement the principle of running newspapers by the whole Party. Propagandizing Mao Zedong Thought is the task of the whole Party, and it must be done well by mobilizing the strength of the whole Party. The prefectural committee has always attached importance to the leadership of the newspaper. Many Party committees proposed: "Work must strive for the first, and reports must strive for the upper reaches." "Who is a hero, who is a good man, compare it in Mindong Daily" has become a popular saying among cadres and the masses during the competition. More than 140 Party committee reporting groups headed by the first secretary of the Party committee and more than 1,000 correspondents in the whole region have formed a strong reporting network. The reporting groups send articles to the newspaper in a planned way, which greatly improves the quality of the articles. Many Party committee secretaries often compile special pages and propose topics for us, so that the newspaper can promptly understand the new situations and new problems in practical work and promptly reflect them in the newspaper. We have also particularly strengthened the training of farmer correspondents. There are more than 400 backbone farmer correspondents. Many of them were illiterate at first, but after several years of training and education by the newspaper, they have become amateur writers or folk singers. For example, the small novels by the farmer writer Hu Banglun have been published in magazines such as "People's Literature" and "Hot Wind," and Lin Xiaowei's mountain songs have been included in Red Flag Ballads. Through them, Mindong Daily has established close ties with the broad masses of workers and peasants.

Third, organize editors and reporters to seriously study Mao Zedong Thought and transform their world outlook. After several years of political movements, especially the anti-rightist and anti-right-leaning struggles, the political level of editors and reporters has been greatly improved. In order to continuously improve the ideological nature of the newspaper, we persist in 12 hours of theoretical study every week. The Selected Works of Mao Zedong are often placed on the table, and we consult Chairman Mao whenever we encounter difficulties in our work. We also implement rotation of labor and going to the countryside and factories, so that the political and ideological level of editors and reporters has been greatly improved. Now, all comrades in the newspaper are full of enthusiasm and are continuing to work hard to become a first-class prefectural newspaper in the country.

    怎样根据小报特点宣传毛泽东思想
    福建省闽东日报代表　李裕德
    我代表福建省闽东日报汇报一下我们是怎样根据小报的特点宣传毛泽东思想的。闽东日报创刊八年来在中共福安地委的领导下，在广大通讯员的支持和报社全体职工的努力下，随着形势的不断发展，报纸的政治质量有显著的提高。读者喜欢看闽东日报，有的把报纸比作“知心朋友”，基层组织还把报纸的社论、新闻当作向群众宣传的教材。报纸在实际工作中起了“组织、鼓舞、激励、批判和推动的作用”。
    我们两年来的报纸宣传，可以概括为这样几句话：一根红线，五个办法，三个保证。
              一根红线
    我们两年来的宣传贯串着一根鲜明的红线，就是结合党的各个时期的中心工作宣传毛泽东思想。用这个根本的思想来武装闽东的百万群众，为完成党的各个时期的中心任务，实现党的建设社会主义的总路线、大跃进和人民公社而奋斗！
    有人形容闽东地区是“山高、水冷、地瘦、人穷”。在寿宁高山的凉亭上出现过这么一首诗：“山高岭大，爬起害怕，离开寿宁，绝不想它”。有些人革命意志不坚定，他们看不到闽东群众的坚强的革命性，看不到这种革命性是改变闽东落后面貌的主要动力。这种地区条件论严重地束缚了人们的主观能动作用。1958年大跃进，出现了许多奇迹，向来是落后的闽东，早稻单产争得全省第一，大战钢铁连续跃居全省上游。特别是最小、最穷的周宁、寿宁县，在钢铁上争得了全省上游。怎样来宣传这个动人的奇迹呢？地委指示我们：要借这件事大长闽东人民的志气，大作文章。我们学习了毛主席的著作，以毛主席的“穷则思变，要干、要革命”、“一张白纸好画最新、最美的图画”的英明论断，满腔热情地报道了这个重大的胜利。组织了一个大专页，标题是：“水冷只怕心火热，山高那及干劲高，人穷地穷要革命，全省第一红旗飘”。着重阐明正因为闽东特别穷，所以人民在党的领导下干劲冲天，斗志昂扬，这是改变穷白面貌的决定因素。这个宣传起了强烈的鼓动作用，“闽东人民挥彩笔，穷白山区画新图”的口号深入人心。宁德福山大队社员们在党和报纸这样的口号鼓舞下，干劲大起，一年就赶上了富队。寿宁山凉亭上又出现了一首诗：“山高岭大，我们不怕，建设新寿宁，要把荒山绿化。”
    毛主席教导我们说：“气可鼓不可泄”，并且指示我们要善于辨风向，抓主流。我们坚决地贯彻了这一指示。在去年农村整风算账时，右倾机会主义分子和一些富裕中农刮起了一阵歪风，攻击党的总路线、大跃进和人民公社。我们报纸就大插红旗，表扬先进，大鼓干劲。这一年，以报纸一、二版头条地位及重要篇幅发表报道先进人物的文章一百五十九篇，表扬一百八十九个先进单位，用具体事例宣传了人民公社的优越性，宣传了总路线、大跃进的正确。大大鼓舞了群众干劲，保卫了三面红旗。罗源丰余大队社员、干部赞扬这个时期的报纸说：“每天看报纸都是热腾腾的，真是在给我们壮胆。”5、6月间，有人怀疑千斤稻、万斤薯的可能性，我们又根据地委“组织竞赛，打破沉闷空气”的指示，报道寿宁县开展千斤稻、万斤薯竞赛的消息，发表了“论夏季形势”、“大搞千斤稻、万斤薯有利条件”等文章，又报道了山高水冷的寿宁含头生产队亩产千斤的典型，推动了全专区的农业竞赛。当有人攻击积极分子时，我们又用了将近一个版的篇幅，报道了工作好、劳动好、热爱人民公社的生产队长陈兰盛，使基层干部看了扬眉吐气。
    今年初春，在技术革命运动中，我们着重宣传了毛主席教导的劳动人民最聪明的观点，组织了“生产实践出科学，劳动人民最聪明”
  “公社社员志气大，骑上科学千里马”等六个专页，以大量的篇幅报道了群众性的科学研究成果，并在“劳动、实践、科学”的社论中阐明了科学来自实践，劳动人民最聪明的道理。宁德县五里洋等公社组织七十多个技术员学习这些报道和社论后，破除迷信，解放思想，建立了四个自动化工厂。福建日报还专门作了报道，并转载了“劳动、实践、科学”这篇社论。
    技术革命开展之后，有些人认为改革几道工序就万事大吉了，就可以满足了。我们根据毛主席“矛盾不断出现又不断解决，就是事物发展的辩证规律”的原理，及时批驳了这种革命到顶论，结合罗源农械厂的具体事例，指出：随着一部分手工操作改变为机器操作，出现了新的不平衡，劳动组织、定额等必须跟着改变，这样才能不断提高生产力。
    由于我们时刻注意结合中心工作宣传毛泽东思想，这就使报纸的思想性大大提高。
                五个办法
    我们根据党对宣传工作的指示，拿当地的农民经验向农民作细致分析。同时，抓住地方特点，采用群众喜闻乐见的形式，通过五个办法进行通俗的宣传。
    第一、用理论观点来统帅事实材料，揭示事物的本质意义。在1959年春天，闽东雨水很多，春耕农活十分紧迫，许多工作停顿下来。我们根据地委利用春雨有利一面的指示，又学习了毛主席的好事坏事可以互相转化的原理，在“利用春雨有利一面，限制它的不利的一面”的大标题下，发表了一个地区利用春雨多溪水大来流放木材，和另一个地方在屋内烧草木灰的消息，还配合一篇短论：“有利和不利”辩证地说明利用春雨来为人们服务的道理。一个怕春雨多的农民看了报纸说：“这么一点就明白了，赶紧设法把雨水管住。”这就把一个动态性的消息提高到理论的高度。
    第二、运用活人活事活道理，以实论虚，以虚推实。农民易于接受形象化教育，可是又不能光罗列一些具体事例，而要按照事物发展的规律，抓住其中最典型的事实，提到理论高度上来宣传，这样就有强烈的说服力。比如周宁县穷濑这个地方，原来条件十分不利，群众说有三害：即兽害、地瘦、人少。可是，这里的群众立下雄心大志，组织力量进行大围剿，消灭兽害；兴修起水利，改良了土壤，改变了瘦地，取得了大丰收。我们以群众干劲大，穷濑变富濑的思想来报道这个事实。这就给读者一个明确的结论：干劲是促进后进向先进转化的主要因素。
    第三、树立对立面，进行对比报道，揭示事物的本质。我们曾经发表过两个社的对比报道。这两个社条件相同，产量相差二成多，表面上看是因为措施有差别：一个社是坚决贯彻了密植，另一个社放松了密植。那么，是不是单纯技术措施上的差别呢？报道进一步探索了原因：原来一个社是人人争上游；另一个社是甘居中游。我们在报道时用了这样的标题：“一条收成证明的真理”，说明增产不在条件好坏，而是在于是否力争上游。
    第四、运用群众语言、通俗易懂，使人一目了然，一见不忘。比如：用“牵牛要牵牛鼻子”来说明工作要抓关键；用“有矛必有盾”来说明有困难就有办法；用“穷山飞出金凤凰”来比喻条件差的地方也可以创造出奇迹，用“磨刀不误砍柴工”来说明技术革命不误生产的道理。又如描写寿宁含头生产队社员干劲的通讯“山区中状元”里，有这样一段话：“就是这个太阳迟出早落的山村，过去一直被人称做‘黑洞洞’、‘棺材洞’，穷得割肉不出血，抬不起头，说不响话……有了党的领导，个个都是你能搬梯子，我就敢上天的人，决心要用自己的双手来修理地球。”这些语言，比较形象、生动，通俗易懂，给群众的影响很深刻。不少地方，拿我们的社论作民校的教材和报告内容。
    第五、提出一些有强烈的鼓动性的口号和标题并运用山歌来宣传毛泽东思想。如我们曾经用过这样一些大标题：“高速度逼出大智大勇”、“发扬主观能动性，一切困难化灰尘”、“业业有真学问，行行出土专家”等。群众常常用我们报上的标题作标语、口号。我们抓住闽东群众喜爱山歌的特点，有意识地通过山歌来宣传毛泽东思想，来指导工作。如一首山歌这样写：
    毛泽东著作是法宝，武装思想觉悟高，
    浪里雾里辨方向，建设祖国有依靠。
    有依靠，干劲高，敢摘太阳当球抛，
    百丈深涧能跳过，大海也能把针捞。
    报纸天天有山歌，版版有山歌，标题山歌化。大跃进以来，发表了不少质量较高的山歌。如“红旗歌谣”选了福建民歌六首，其中四首是闽东日报发表过的。本报发表的农民林孝为的山歌“小农经济”和另一首山歌“唱给月亮听”也得到好评。
                三个保证
    结合实际工作宣传毛泽东思想，这是报纸的一项严肃的政治任务，要宣传得好，必须有下列三个保证：
    第一、绝对服从党的领导。党委指向哪里，我们就奔向哪里。一般在地委指示后，第二天、第三天就见了报。地委书记经常给我们出点子，讲意图。我们报上所有比较出色的报道，无一不是地委出的题目。这就是我们宣传毛泽东思想的一个重要保证。
    第二、贯彻全党办报。宣传毛泽东思想是全党的任务，必须动员全党的力量才能做好。地委一贯重视对报纸的领导，许多党委提出：工作要争第一，报道要争上游。”谁英雄、谁好汉，闽东日报上比比看”，这已成为干部群众在竞赛时流行的话。全区一百四十多个以党委第一书记为首的党委报道组，和一千多个通讯员，形成了一个强有力的通讯网，报道组有计划地向报社发稿，使稿件的质量大大提高。许多党委书记经常给我们编专页、出题目，使报纸能及时了解实际工作中的新情况、新问题，并及时反映在报纸上。我们还特别加强了对农民通讯员的培养。现有农民骨干通讯员四百多人，有不少原来一字不识，经过报社几年的培养教育，已成为业余作者或民间歌手。如农民作者胡邦伦的小小说，曾在“人民文学”、
  “热风”等杂志刊物上发表，林孝为的山歌被编入红旗歌谣。通过他们，使闽东日报和广大工农群众建立了密切的联系。
    第三、组织编辑人员认真学习毛泽东思想，改造世界观。经过几年来的政治运动，特别是反右派和反右倾斗争，使编辑、记者的政治水平大大提高。为了不断提高报纸的思想性，每周坚持十二小时的理论学习，毛泽东选集经常放在桌上，工作中一遇困难就请教毛主席。还实行了轮流下放劳动和下乡下厂，使编辑、记者政治思想水平有很大的提高。现在，报社全体同志干劲冲天，正为争取成为全国第一流专区报而继续努力。
