Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, June 26th: More than a thousand overseas Chinese who suffered persecution in Indonesia arrived in Fuzhou by train from Guangzhou on the 23rd.

This group of returned overseas Chinese used to be miners, workers, and small vendors in places like Belitung, Bangka, and Penang in Indonesia. They are extremely angry at the arrogant and unreasonable persecution of overseas Chinese by powerful groups in Indonesia. Old tin miners Chen Ya San and Gao Wen Sheng said: In Belitung, there are many old miners like us with decades of service who have worked hard all their lives and are sick from overwork, but are kicked away and their lives are in desperate straits. Recently, another three hundred Chinese miners were unreasonably laid off. We will never tolerate such anti-China and anti-Chinese atrocities by powerful groups in Indonesia. The old miner Li Lu, holding a tattered blanket he brought back, said sadly: "I was sold to Belitung at the age of nineteen and have been mining tin for more than forty years, but I am too poor to start a family. Now that I have returned to the embrace of the motherland and have been properly resettled, I sincerely thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao."

This group of returned overseas Chinese, who are about to take up work, have expressed their determination to work hard to participate in the socialist construction of the motherland. Xie Lian Shou, a returned overseas Chinese worker, said that after powerful groups in Indonesia launched an anti-Chinese wave, the small grocery stores run by overseas Chinese were forced to close, and he lost his job; Chinese schools were closed, and his children also lost their schooling, and the whole family was displaced and unable to make a living. He said: "Now that the motherland has rescued us from desperation, I must work hard and contribute to building the motherland and building our hometown."

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, June 26th: More than six hundred and eighty returned overseas Chinese who recently returned from Indonesia to Yunnan to participate in socialist construction have all been properly resettled.

Among these six hundred returned overseas Chinese, more than sixty students remained in Kunming to continue their studies, more than one hundred workers with technical expertise were assigned to industrial and mining enterprises such as Gejiu, and the remaining five hundred were all settled in the Pingyuan Street Overseas Chinese Farm in Wenshan County, which has fertile land and a warm climate.

These overseas Chinese, who were forced to return to the country due to the anti-Chinese activities of powerful groups in Indonesia, expressed their gratitude for the proper resettlement by the motherland. Yang Jinlong, an overseas Chinese who returned from East Java, was very happy to be assigned to the Pingyuan Street Overseas Chinese Farm in Wenshan County, which has 200,000 mu of land, more than twenty (standard) tractors, and fairly good water conservancy facilities. He said: "I will work hard to produce and build my new home." Wu Wentong, who returned from West Java, was assigned to drive a car in Gejiu, and his wife and mother-in-law and their family of eight went with him. Wu Wentong said gratefully: "I am very satisfied with the way the motherland has arranged my work and life. I believe that my relatives overseas will be happy to hear this news." Weng Deyu and other three students who love sports such as weightlifting and swimming were recommended to study at the Yunnan Provincial Institute of Physical Education, and they all expressed that they would study hard and create excellent results to bring glory to the motherland.

During their stay in Kunming, this group of returned overseas Chinese received a warm reception from the leaders of the Yunnan Province and Kunming City Party and government and the people of Kunming. On the afternoon of the 16th, Zhang Chong, Vice Governor of Yunnan Province, Zhang Zizhai, Secretary-General of the Provincial People's Committee, Jing Zhu Ru, Vice Mayor of Kunming City, and others, all went to the residence of the returned overseas Chinese to express their condolences. Liu Minghui, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Governor of Yunnan Province, also had a dinner with the overseas Chinese, encouraging them to work and study hard.

On the 26th, another group of more than ninety overseas Chinese students who returned from Indonesia arrived in Kunming from Guangzhou, and received a warm welcome from the Yunnan Provincial Reception and Resettlement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese, as well as more than five hundred ethnic minority youth students and returned overseas Chinese students. They will be settled in middle schools in Kunming City to continue their studies.
