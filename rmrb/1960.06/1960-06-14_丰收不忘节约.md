    Bumper Harvest, Don't Forget Thrift
    After harvesting 294 mu of barley and buckwheat, the members of the Xiduo Production Team of the Guomeng Commune in Yancheng County were all smiles, celebrating the great harvest of the first year of the 1960s. But everyone immediately thought: This year the wheat grew better and yielded more than in previous years. Based on past experience of eating grain, we must be careful and meticulous in our calculations, achieve a steady flow, and ensure that life gets sweeter and sweeter. At the meeting to discuss saving grain, many people shared their experiences of managing their daily lives. For example, poor peasant Wang Jinpei said: "Eating grain requires a plan. Without a plan, you cannot live a good life. As the saying goes, 'Eating won't make you poor, dressing won't make you poor, but a lack of planning will make you poor for life.'" Team member Yuan Zhaojiang also calculated an account: "If the production team saves five qian of rice per person per day, the entire team of 316 people can save 5,688 jin of grain per year, which can feed twelve people for a year."
    After enhancing our thinking and unifying our understanding, the production team leader led everyone in formulating many methods for planned grain consumption and saving grain.
    At the same time, saving grain has also improved everyone's lives. The canteen offers rice, porridge, soup, and vegetables, all complete with variety. We eat meat once every ten days.
    Currently, we have saved about 400 jin of grain, and everyone has developed a habit of planned grain consumption and saving grain.

    丰收不忘节约
    我们盐城县郭猛公社西垛生产队收完了二百九十四亩大麦、元麦以后，个个社员笑逐颜开，欢庆六十年代头一年的大丰收。但是大家马上就想到：今年麦子比往年长得好、收得多，根据往年的吃粮经验，必须精打细算，做到细水长流，保证生活越过越甜。在节约用粮的讨论会上，许多人都谈出自己过日子的经验。例如贫农王金培说：“吃粮要计划，没有计划就不能过好日子，俗话说，‘吃不穷，穿不穷，不会计划一世穷’”。社员袁兆江还算了一笔帐：“如果生产队每人每天省五钱米，全队三百十六个人每年就能节省五千六百八十八斤粮食，能供十二个人吃一年。”
    在提高思想统一认识以后，生产队长就领导大伙订出了计划用粮节约用粮的许多办法。
    同时，通过节约粮食还改善了大伙的生活。食堂做到有饭有粥，有汤有菜，各样俱全，每十天吃荤一次。
    目前我们已节约了约四百斤粮食，大家都形成了计划用粮，节约粮食的风气。
