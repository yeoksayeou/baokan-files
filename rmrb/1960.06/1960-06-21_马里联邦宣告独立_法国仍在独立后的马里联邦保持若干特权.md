Xinhua News Agency, Dakar, June 20th: The Mali Federation, located in West Africa, formally declared its independence today.

At midnight on the 20th, Sangaré, Speaker of the Mali Federation Assembly, read the declaration of independence for the Mali Federation in the Federal Assembly, at which time the representatives stood up and cheered. Simultaneously, the capital of the Mali Federation, Dakar, fired 101 cannon salutes, and the bell towers rang for a long time.

The Mali Federation was formed in April 1959 by the union of Senegal and Sudan, member states within the "French Community." It has a total population of over 5.9 million and a territory almost twice the size of mainland France.

Senegal and Sudan were successively invaded by French colonialists from 1885 and incorporated into French West Africa, becoming French colonies. The people there have been engaged in heroic struggles against colonial rule, demanding national independence.

Faced with the Mali Federation people's resolute demand for independence, the French government was finally forced to agree to its independence in April of this year.

According to the so-called "cooperation agreements" signed between France and the Mali Federation, France still retains certain privileges in the independent Mali Federation. The agreement stipulates that the Mali Federation will participate in the adjusted "Community"; France will retain its military bases in the Mali Federation; and both parties will consult on diplomatic matters to coordinate their foreign policies. In addition, in terms of finance, the Mali Federation will continue to remain within the Franc Zone and the monetary and customs union of French West African countries.

    马里联邦宣告独立
    法国仍在独立后的马里联邦保持若干特权
    新华社20日讯　达喀尔消息：位于西非的马里联邦今天正式宣告独立。
    20日零时，马里联邦议长桑戈尔在联邦议会宣读了关于马里联邦的独立声明，当时，代表们都起立欢呼。在这同时，马里联邦首都达喀尔鸣放礼炮一百零一响，各钟楼长时间地发出钟声。
    马里联邦是在1959年4月由“法兰西共同体”内的成员国塞内加尔和苏丹联合组成的，总人口五百九十多万，国土比法国本土几乎大两倍。
    塞内加尔和苏丹自1885年相继为法国殖民主义者侵入，并被法国并入法属西非洲，成为法国的殖民地。那里的人民一直展开英勇的斗争，反对殖民统治，要求民族独立。
    面对着马里联邦人民坚决要求独立的斗争，法国政府在今年4月终于被迫同意它独立。
    根据法国同马里联邦签订的所谓“合作协定”，法国仍在独立后的马里联邦保持若干特权。协定规定，马里联邦参加调整后的“共同体”；法国将保留它在马里联邦的军事基地；双方要在外交方面进行协商，以协调它们的外交政策。此外，在财政方面，马里联邦将继续留在法郎区和法属西非国家的货币和关税联盟内。
