    This newspaper reports: The CCP Lujiang County Committee Writing Group reported: Shang Yishun, the General Branch Secretary of the Model Brigade of Tongda People's Commune in Lujiang County, Anhui Province, has consistently worked diligently and selflessly for the past ten years. He adheres to the principle of running the commune diligently and frugally, which has been praised by commune members and has promoted sustained leaps in production.
    Shang Yishun is forty-five years old this year. There are five people in his family, and the labor force is not large. Because of his saving and careful use, he has a surplus every year. In the past few years, the government and the commune have awarded him personal prizes and more than 600 yuan in bonuses, but he has not spent a penny and has given all of it to the commune as public property. Shang Yishun cherishes public property as if it were his own eyes.
    In 1958, when he went to Beijing for a meeting, the commune members asked him to withdraw more money to buy some new clothes. But he disagreed, and only brought a few clean old clothes and two days' worth of dry food, which he ate on the train. For the fourteen-day round trip to Beijing, he only reimbursed 2 yuan and 53 fen for travel expenses. This incident greatly influenced and educated the brigade's cadres and commune members. In 1959, the brigade's cadres went to Beijing, Hefei, and the county for meetings two or thirty times. They all brought their own dry food and walked as much as possible. They only reimbursed 23 yuan and 50 fen for travel expenses, saving 186 yuan compared to the expenditure standards stipulated by the commune and the brigade.
    The two old desks in the brigade office had two legs broken, so Shang Yishun used an axe to cut wooden sticks and repair them himself. Office paper is used on both sides, and red and blue inks are also made by himself using pigments. The pen holder is made by nailing old toothpaste boxes together. When there are many people at meetings in the evening, large lights are used, and when there are few people, small lights are used, never wasting a bit of oil. Over the year, administrative expenses were saved by 469 yuan. He often said to the accountant: "The commune members trust us and hand over tens of thousands of yuan of property to us. How can we be worthy of the commune members if we don't use it frugally?" In order to save expenses and improve the commune members' meals, he also planted one mu of vegetable experimental field himself. Last year alone, he sent more than 10,000 jin of vegetables to the canteen and kindergarten.
    "The family has property in the thousands, the key is handed over to the commune members to manage, democratic financial management is clear in everything, everyone is honest and there are no objections." This is Shang Yishun's characteristic of managing finances and implementing economic accounting. When formulating the production and financial plan in 1959, in addition to strengthening the education of financial personnel in honesty and selflessness through the Party organization and formulating financial accounts, cash management, and other systems, he paid special attention to democratic management. He said: "There is so much property, if you want to manage it well, you can only hand over the key to the commune members. The commune members know when to use it and when not to use it." When the brigade ran a pig farm and a chicken farm, it was calculated that eighty-five houses would require at least 2,720 yuan and 1,500 labor days. Shang Yishun handed this issue over to the commune members for discussion. Based on the principle of "saving as much as possible and using the money for production," the commune members proposed many simple and crude methods, and as a result, only 520 yuan and 436 labor days were used. Shang Yishun was not stingy with the money that should be used. In order to improve labor efficiency, the brigade invested more than 26,000 yuan last year to buy a power water pump, modified more than 2,600 large and small farm tools, and made fourteen animal-powered water pumps. During the drought resistance and water extraction in 1959, the water pump played a great role, increasing efficiency by fifteen times and saving more than 8,800 labor days.
    In order to enable the commune members to understand the brigade's assets, all accounts can be announced on time. Once, he went to the first production team to listen to the accountant announce the accounts. Some elderly commune members reflected: "The announcement is an announcement, but the words are too long, and we can't remember so much; the characters are too small, and we can't see them clearly." He then discussed with the accountant a "one glance clear" announcement table, changing small characters to large characters, writing and drawing each item of income and expenditure, and also composing local folk songs and jingles. The commune members could see clearly, understand clearly, and were very happy. Commune member Ding Nengcheng said: "The secretary's method is really good, not only can we understand the accounts, but we can also learn to read and sing while looking at the accounts." In addition, each labor force in the commune members' families has three handbooks: work point accounts, income accounts, and expenditure accounts. The accountant also often goes deep into the fields and the commune members' homes to visit and check, so that no errors occur in any account.
    The brigade's work is increasing, but Shang Yishun never forgets to participate in production. He said: "To chop firewood, you have to go up the mountain; to catch fish, you have to go into the water. If you don't participate in production yourself, you can't do a good job in production." In his work, he adopted six methods: planting (planting experimental fields well), squatting (squatting in poor teams), moving (moving the office to the fields when production is busy), squeezing (making full use of time), leading (taking the lead in the most difficult production), and learning (learning political culture and technology, learning to use advanced tools), to properly combine work and production. In 1959, he worked a total of 231 labor days, and also planted 8.5 mu of various experimental fields with the commune members as a base for regular production. In his experimental field, he held fifty-six on-site meetings on deep plowing, rice seedling cultivation, and cotton topping. The early rice, middle rice, and sweet potato experimental fields he planted set a high-yield red flag for the entire brigade. The commune members generally said: "The secretary planted experimental fields, and all production is leading. He takes the lead in labor and sets an example, and the experimental field has become a promotion station." Shang Yishun does not relax at all about production time. Whether he goes to the commune or the production team, he always makes good use of the journey. In order to accumulate fertilizer, he usually takes small roads instead of big roads when he goes to other places, and goes around the back of the village instead of the front of the village, accumulating more than 10,000 jin of manure a year. The manure basket he started using was made of bamboo, which could not hold much manure and was not strong; later, he came up with a method of wrapping the manure basket with iron wire, which could hold much more manure than before. A 70-year-old man, Ding, from the seventh production team, said after seeing it: "The secretary is really diligent and frugal, wrapping the manure basket with iron wire. He never goes empty-handed, and carries a big load when he goes out. Accumulating fertilizer is like accumulating gold, and all the old people follow suit." Later, fifteen elderly commune members formed a "white beard fertilizer accumulation team," accumulating more than 1,000 loads of fertilizer a year.
    Under the influence of Shang Yishun's diligent and frugal style, the commune members' enthusiasm for production is getting higher and higher, and the face of production is changing with each passing day. In 1959, the average grain yield per mu reached more than 1,300 jin, an increase of more than six times compared to 1949, and an increase of 37% compared to 1958. This brigade has been rated as a national model unit twice, a provincial model unit five times, a prefectural model unit four times, and a county model unit seven times.

    珍惜公家点滴财产　带头生产树立榜样
    商宜顺同志克勤克俭十年如一日
    本报讯　中共庐江县委编写组报道：安徽省庐江县同大人民公社模范大队总支书记商宜顺，十年来一贯勤勤恳恳，克己奉公，并坚持勤俭办社原则，受到了社员赞扬，推动了生产持续跃进。
    商宜顺今年四十五岁，家中五口人，劳力不多，由于他节省使用，年年有余额。几年来，政府和公社奖给他个人的奖品和六百多元奖金，他分文未用，全部交给社里为公共财产。对公共财产，商宜顺更是像爱护自己的眼珠一样。
    1958年，他到北京开会，社员叫他多支一些钱，买几件新衣服。可是他不同意，只带了几件洗干净的旧衣服和两天的干粮，在火车上吃。去北京来回十四天，他只报销了两元五角叁分钱的旅差费。这件事，大大影响和教育了大队的干部和社员。1959年，大队的干部到北京、合肥和县里开会，不下二、三十次，他们都自带干粮，能步行尽量步行，仅报销车旅费二十三元五角，比公社、大队规定开支标准，节约了一百八十六元。
    大队办公室里的两张旧办公桌，断了两条腿，商宜顺就自己用斧头砍木棍修好。办公用纸，都是两面用，红蓝墨水也是自己买颜料做。笔筒，是用旧牙膏盒子钉起来的。晚上开会，人多用大灯，人少用小灯，从不浪费一点油。一年来，节约了行政费四百六十九元。他经常向会计说：“社员信赖我们，把几十万元的财产交给我们，不节约使用，怎么对得起社员。”为了节省开支，改善社员的伙食，他自己还种了一亩蔬菜试验田。去年一年，送给食堂、幼儿园的蔬菜，就有一万多斤。
    “家有财产千千万，钥匙交给社员管，民主理财事事清，人人廉洁无意见。”这是商宜顺管理财务，实行经济核算的特点。1959年制订生产财务计划时，他除了通过党的组织，对财务人员加强廉洁奉公的教育和制订财务账目、现金管理等制度外，特别重视民主管理。他说：“财产这样多，要想管得好，只有把钥匙交给社员，当用不当用，社员知道。”大队办养猪场、养鸡场时，据计算，八十五间房子，至少要两千七百二十元和一千五百个劳动日。商宜顺就把这个问题交给社员讨论。社员根据“能省就省，把钱用在生产上”的原则，提出很多因陋就简的办法，结果只用了五百二十元和四百三十六个劳动日。当用的钱，商宜顺一点也不吝啬。为提高劳动工效，大队根据社员要求，去年投资两万六千多元，买了一架动力抽水机，改了大小农具两千六百多件，自制十四部畜力抽水机。在1959年抗旱车水时，抽水机发挥了很大作用，工效提高十五倍，节省劳动力八千八百多个。
    为了使社员都了解大队的家底，各项账目都能按时公布。有一次，他到第一生产队听会计公布账目，有些老年社员反映：“公布是公布，不过话讲得长，记不了那么多；字又小，也看不清楚。”他便同会计研究了“一见清”的公布表，改小字为大字，哪项收入，哪项支出，一边写字，一边画图，还编上山歌顺口溜。社员看得清楚，听得明白，都很高兴。社员丁能成说：“书记这个办法真好，不仅了解了账目，还能边看账，边识字，学唱歌。”此外，社员家里每个劳力都有工分账、收入账和支出账三本手册，会计还经常深入到田间、社员家里访问查对，不使一笔账发生错误。
    大队工作越来越多，可是商宜顺永不忘记参加生产。他说：“砍柴要上山，捉鱼要下水，自己不参加生产，不能把生产搞好。”在工作中，他采用种（种好试验田）、蹲（蹲到穷队）、搬（生产忙时，办公室搬到田间）、挤（充分利用时间）、带（带头干最困难的生产）、学（学习政治文化技术、学习使用先进工具）六个办法，妥善地做到工作与生产的结合。1959年他共做劳动日二百三十一个，还和社员一起，种了各种试验田八亩半，作为经常生产的基地。在他的试验田里，他召开了深耕、育秧、棉花打叉等五十六次现场会议。他种的早稻、中稻、山芋试验田，为全大队树立了高产红旗。社员普遍说：“书记种了试验田，样样生产都领先，劳动带头作榜样，试验田变成推广站。”对生产的时间，商宜顺一点也不放松。不论到公社或生产队去，都是路不空行。为了积肥，平常他到别的地方去，大路不走走小路，村前不走走村后，一年共拾粪一万多斤。他开始用的粪箕，是竹子编的，装的粪少，也不牢固；以后他想了个办法，用铁丝把粪箕盘起来，比过去多装很多粪。第七生产队一位七十多岁丁老大爷看了，说：“书记真勤俭，粪箕铁丝盘。来回不空手，出门一大担，积肥如积金，老年个个跟上前。”以后，就有十五个老年社员成立了“白胡子积肥队”，一年积肥一千多担。
    在商宜顺克勤克俭的作风影响下，社员的生产积极性越来越高，生产面貌日新月异。1959年粮食平均亩产达一千三百多斤，比1949年提高六倍多，比1958年增加37％。这个大队先后两次被评为全国模范单位，五次被评为省的模范单位，四次被评为专区的模范单位，七次被评为县的模范单位。
