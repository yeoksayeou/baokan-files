    Vigorously Develop National Defense Sports in Coordination with Militia Training
    Representative of the National Defense Sports Committee of Shou Zhang County, Shandong Province, Tian Jianmin
    Our county has implemented Chairman Mao's military thought, combined with militia training, and rapidly developed national defense sports by adopting "native methods" and "poor methods."
    "Communism is paradise, and the people's commune is the bridge." After realizing the people's commune, our county, holding high the red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, achieved farmland water conservancy and raised-bed cultivation with soaring enthusiasm, overcame drought, and reaped a bumper harvest in the drought year of 1959. The average yield per mu of 1.2 million mu of grain fields in the county was 620 jin, an increase of 24% compared with the Great Leap Forward year of 1958; the total industrial output value also doubled compared with 1958, reaching 4.6 million yuan. The whole county presented a scene of prosperity and prosperity. The great development of production, the great improvement of living standards, and the great improvement of the degree of people's organization have opened up a broader world for the popularization of sports activities. More than 360,000 people in the county regularly participate in sports activities, accounting for 68% of the population. With the development of the mass militia division movement, a new upsurge of vigorously developing national defense sports throughout the county has been set off, and great achievements have been made. It was once circulated among the masses:
    The three great banners shine brightly, and production leaps forward to produce more grain;
    Increased production requires good health, and regular exercise strengthens physique;
    National defense sports are widely carried out, and the fragrance of flowers spreads throughout Shou Zhang.
    This ballad is a praise from the broad masses of Shou Zhang for strengthening their physique, reducing diseases, cultivating reserve forces for national defense, and promoting production, work, and study since the development of sports activities and the vigorous development of national defense sports.
    Combining sports activities with militia training is our good tradition. In the Jingyanggang area of our county, whenever military training and rectification were carried out in the past, sports activities such as martial arts, running, jumping, playing basketball, and climbing poles were carried out. Since Chairman Mao issued the great call for running mass militia divisions, under the organization and leadership of the county party committee, the people of our county have established 19 militia divisions and carried out military training activities. Due to the development of national defense, simply carrying out the original sports activities cannot meet the requirements of modern national defense construction, as young people reflect: "Carrying big guns and practicing running are only suitable for the tastes of the older generation of militia." In order to enrich the content of military training, enable the people to learn more modern military science knowledge, and cultivate technical talents for the realization of agricultural mechanization, the county party committee, in accordance with Chairman Mao's military thought, strengthened the leadership of national defense sports work. Since 1958, the county has successively established shooting, radio, navigation, motorcycle, aviation, parachuting, and air defense clubs, and more than 1,000 amateur clubs have also been established at the grassroots level, extensively carrying out various activities.
    The development process of national defense sports in our county is also a process of struggle between two ideologies. For example, some people believe that "doing sports cannot increase grain production and delays production"; "Schools have physical education classes, doing national defense sports affects learning, and advocate doing less or not doing it at all," and so on. The county party committee resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's instruction of "developing sports and strengthening the people's physique," and led the people of the county to actively carry out national defense sports in the spirit that sports must serve labor production and national defense construction. In order to improve the masses' understanding of sports, we first started with sports projects that have immediate results. The county party committee instructed the navigation, motorcycle, aviation model, radio and other clubs to focus on training backbones and instructors in factories, production teams, government agencies, and schools. The result was very good. For example, flag communication personnel who had been trained in Houmiao, Taiqian and other communes along the Yellow River used semaphore to transmit the commander's orders during last year's flood prevention, and timely dispatched manpower to protect dangerous projects; in the large-scale locust control, they used semaphore to express their actions and unified the extermination of insects, eliminating the harm of locusts to crops; they trained broadcasters for broadcasting stations and telegraphers for post and telecommunications bureaus, improving the quality of work and speeding up the completion of tasks; motorcycle drivers trained for post and telecommunications, public security and other nine departments have repeatedly issued emergency official documents such as preventing frost, preventing freezing, rescuing and exterminating insects in a timely manner, and assisted public security departments in solving four major cases such as counter-revolutionaries and murderers; many middle schools have applied mathematics and physics knowledge in the process of carrying out aviation model activities, consolidating and deepening students' understanding of natural sciences. The vivid facts that sports promote production, work, and study have educated the masses and corrected all kinds of wrong ideas. According to this situation, the county party committee made a new resolution, including sports work on the agenda of the Standing Committee meeting, implementing the responsibility system at all levels of county magistrate, conscription bureau chief, commune chief, management district director, and production team leader, strengthening leadership, increasing the number of sports committee cadres, and instructing the conscription bureau, sports committee, trade union, youth league and other relevant departments to cooperate closely, twist into a rope, and vigorously carry out national defense sports activities.
    In the early stage of vigorously developing national defense sports in Shou Zhang County, there were practical difficulties such as lack of equipment and technical personnel. But difficulties cannot scare the masses. Shou Zhang No. 3 Middle School was the first to respond to the call of the county party committee. With the revolutionary spirit of "starting from scratch," they held a "swearing-in meeting to launch mass movements with indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods." In five days, 820 students in the school solved all equipment problems with "poor methods" and initially learned the basic knowledge of aviation models, radio, semaphore communication, shooting and other projects, proving that "starting with indigenous methods" has great potential. Therefore, the county party committee held an on-site meeting on sports work in the county in the Third Middle School and disseminated the experience in a timely manner. A wave of everyone offering suggestions and plans, and vigorously launching "indigenous methods" quickly swept the county. People used broken wooden box boards, reeds, Hanglian paper, fish bladders, water glue, bicycle horns, as well as bullet casings, screws, etc. to make model airplanes, earth keys, oscillators, and converted old wooden boats into sampans. A total of more than 200,000 pieces of sports equipment were produced. For example, an earth microphone made of a microphone and two batteries can be used for meetings of 1,000 people in communes and teams. An earth telephone made of two handsets and receivers connected to batteries and installed with indicator lights and electric bells is suitable for government agencies, schools, and production brigades. Some schools and production brigades have also made model rockets. The county motorcycle club used the method of finding a steep slope for scrap cars to slide down to train beginners to master the technical operation procedures, and then used good cars for training. In a short time, they were able to fully master the driving skills. This not only saved expenses but also ensured safety, and it not only utilized scrap cars but also accelerated the training speed, and also completed the training task, playing the role of "killing four birds with one stone."
    Under the leadership of the county party committee, the people of Shou Zhang, after overcoming the difficulties of equipment, tried every means to attack the "technical barrier." In addition to the training classes held in the county, communes, teams, factories, and schools carried out large-scale cooperation, adopting methods such as inviting in, sending out, the capable as teachers, delivering equipment to the door, linking middle schools with primary schools, and middle schools with production teams, to train a large number of technical backbones, who served as amateur coaches or instructors in shooting, radio and other items at the grassroots level, and led more than 100,000 people to participate in national defense sports activities. On the basis of the popularization of mass national defense sports, 840 graded athletes and 499 graded referees appeared in the county, and they repeatedly achieved excellent results in the special district sports meet.
    After the mass movement has developed, how to make it improve every day and better serve production and national defense construction is a major event that the county party committee leaders are very concerned about. The county party committee instructed: Around production, combined with militia training, make full use of spare time to carry out national defense sports activities. The specific method is three grasps and five unifications. That is, grasp the plan, grasp the measures, and grasp the evaluation; on the premise of doing a good job in production, sports work is unified in leadership, unified in arrangement, unified in inspection, unified in summary, and unified in rewards with production. Liu Chuanyou, the first secretary of the county party committee, and other leading comrades took the lead by example. While inspecting production and participating in labor, they participated in sports activities with the commune members, which greatly encouraged the masses. At the same time, each production team universally promoted the experience of Zhangqiu Commune, and every time they went to the field to work, they made military training to the field and sports equipment to the field, so that production, military training, and sports were twisted into a rope, which was very popular with the masses. People sang happily: "Labor production is full of energy, sports activities are rest, practice steps on the way back and forth, and practice shooting in the gap of production," and a new situation has emerged in which there are fewer people who do not abide by labor discipline, fewer sick people, and fewer idlers inside and outside the village; more people attend work, more people participate in training, and more people love to sing. Due to the development of sports activities and people's persistence in regular training, the incidence of disease in the county has decreased from 4.5% before the establishment of the commune to 0.9%; the labor attendance rate has increased from 89% to 99%. In this year's anti-drought struggle, flag communication, light communication, radio, earth broadcasting, motorcycles, etc. were brought to the fields to direct production, which played a great role, so that one million mu of wheat in the county was universally watered one to three times, and 6,000 to 7,000 jin of standard fertilizer was applied per mu, and the wheat successfully passed the greening, jointing, and grouting stages. At the same time, national defense sports and militia training are closely combined. For example, trained radio operators, navigation athletes, motorcycle riders, and aviation model athletes are respectively compiled into communication soldiers, sailors, motorcycle soldiers, aviation soldiers, etc. in the militia, and reserve soldiers are cultivated for national defense construction. Last year, 20 radio operators enlisted in the army as communication soldiers, and four of the 12 motorcyclists in Taiqian Commune enlisted in the armored forces.
    The basic reason why we can achieve the above results lies in the wise and correct instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and in the strengthening of our leadership by the State Sports Commission and the provincial and prefectural party committees. However, our work is still far from the requirements of the Party and the needs of the development of the situation. We are determined to hold even higher the red flag of Mao Zedong's military thought, continue to move forward with the spirit of continuous revolution, and make sports better serve the strengthening of the people's physique and the construction and defense of our great motherland.

    配合民兵训练大搞国防体育
    山东省寿张县国防体育委员会代表　田健民
    我县贯彻毛主席军事思想，结合民兵训练，采用“土办法”、“穷办法”迅速地发展了国防体育运动。
    “共产主义是天堂，人民公社是桥梁。”我县在实现人民公社化以后，高举总路线、大跃进和人民公社的红旗，以冲天的干劲，实现了农田水利化，畦田化，战胜了干旱，夺得1959年大旱年的大丰收。全县一百二十万亩粮田平均亩产六百二十斤，比大跃进的1958年又增长24％；工业总产值也比1958年增长了一倍，达到四百六十万元，全县呈现了一片繁荣兴旺的景象。由于生产的大发展，生活的大改善，人民组织程度的大提高，为体育运动的大普及开拓了更为广阔的天地。全县有三十六万多人经常参加体育活动，占人口的68％。随着大办民兵师运动的发展，又掀起了一个全县大搞国防体育的新高潮，并取得了很大的成绩。群众中曾流传着：
    三大万岁放光芒，生产跃进多打粮；
    增产要有好身体，经常锻炼体质强；
    国防体育大开展，花开香遍全寿张。
    这首歌谣，是寿张广大人民对开展体育运动、大搞国防体育以来，增强了体质，减少了疾病，培养了国防后备力量，促进了生产、工作和学习的赞扬。
    结合民兵训练开展体育活动，是我们的良好传统。我县景阳岗一带，过去每逢练兵整训时，都要开展武术、跑、跳、打篮球、攀杠子等体育活动。自从毛主席发出大办民兵师的伟大号召以后，我县人民在县委的组织领导下，建立了十九个民兵师，开展了军事训练活动。由于国防事业的发展，仅仅开展原有体育活动，不能满足现代国防建设的要求，正如青年人反映：“背大枪、练跑步，只适合老一辈民兵的口味”。为了丰富军事训练的内容，使人民学会更多的现代化的军事科学知识，并为实现农业机械化培养技术人才，县委遵照毛主席的军事思想，加强了国防体育工作的领导。1958年以来，县里先后建立了射击、无线电、航海、摩托车、航空、跳伞和防空等俱乐部，基层也建立了一千多个业余俱乐部，广泛地开展了各项活动。
    我县国防体育运动的发展过程，也是两种思想的斗争过程。如有的人认为“搞体育不能增产粮食，耽误生产”；“学校有体育课，搞国防体育，影响学习，主张少搞或不搞”等等。县委坚决执行了毛主席“发展体育运动，增强人民体质”的指示，本着体育必须为劳动生产、国防建设服务的精神，领导全县人民，积极开展国防体育运动。为了提高群众对体育运动的认识，先从立竿见影的运动项目着手，县委责成航海、摩托车、航空模型、无线电等俱乐部，有重点的在工厂、生产队、机关、学校训练骨干与辅导员。这样作的结果很好，如沿着黄河的侯庙、台前等公社经过训练的手旗通讯员，在去年防汛期间，用旗语传达指挥员的号令，及时抽调人力，抢护了险工；在大面积的治蝗中，通过旗语表达行动，统一灭虫，消灭了蝗虫对庄稼的危害；给广播站代训广播员，给邮电局代训报务员，提高了工作质量，加快完成了任务的速度；给邮电、公安等九个部门训练的摩托手，曾多次及时地下达了防霜、防冻、抢险、灭虫等紧急公文，并协助公安部门破获反革命、杀人犯等四起重要案件；许多中学在开展航空模型活动的过程中，运用了数学、物理学知识，巩固与加深了学生对自然学科的理解。体育促进生产、工作和学习的生动事实，教育了群众，纠正了形形色色的错误思想。县委根据这一情况作了新的决议，将体育工作列入常委会议事日程，实行县长、兵役局长、社长、管理区主任、生产队长的层层负责制，加强领导，增配了体委干部，并责成兵役局、体委、工会、团委等有关部门通力合作，拧成一股绳，大力开展国防体育运动。
    寿张县大力开展国防体育运动的初期，存在着缺乏器材、缺技术人员的实际困难。但困难吓不倒群众。寿张第三中学第一个响应了县委的号召，他们以“白手起家”的革命精神，召开了“土法上马，土洋并举，大搞群众运动的誓师大会。全校八百二十名同学，在五天时间内用“穷办法”解决了全部器材问题，并初步学会了航空模型、无线电、手旗通讯、射击等项目的基本知识，证明了“土法上马”大有可为。于是，县委在三中召开了全县体育工作现场会议，及时地传播了经验。一个人人献策，个个献计，大搞“土法上马”的浪潮很快地席卷全县。人们利用破木箱的板子、芦苇、杭连纸、鱼鳔、水胶、自行车的喇叭，以及子弹壳、螺丝钉等制成了模型飞机、土电键、振荡器，用旧木船改制成舢舨等。共制作了体育器材二十余万件。像用一个送话器和两节电池作成的土麦克风，可供社、队开一千人的会议使用。用两个通话器和受话器串连电池，安上指示灯和电铃，制成的土电话，适合机关、学校、生产大队使用。有的学校和生产大队还制成了模型火箭。县摩托车俱乐部利用废车找一陡坡滑下来的办法训练初学的人掌握技术操作程序后，再用好车进行训练，短时间就完全能掌握驾驶技术，这样既节约了开支，又保证了安全，既利用了废车，又加快了训练速度，同样完成了训练任务，起到了“一举四得”的作用。
    寿张人民在县委的领导下，在克服器材的困难之后，又想尽办法猛攻“技术关”。除县里举办训练班外，社社、队队、厂厂、校校开展了大协作，采取请进来，派出去，能者为师，器材送上门，中学与小学，中学与生产队挂钩等方法，培训大批技术骨干，在各基层分别担任射击、无线电等项的业余教练员或辅导员，带动了十余万人参加国防体育活动。在群众性国防体育普及的基础上，全县出现了八百四十名等级运动员和四百九十九名等级裁判员，并多次在专区运动会上获得优异成绩。
    当群众运动发展起来之后，如何使它天天向上，使其更好地为生产和国防建设服务，这是县委领导十分关怀的一件大事。县委指示：围绕生产，结合民兵训练，充分利用业余时间，开展国防体育活动。具体办法是三抓五统一。即抓计划，抓措施，抓评比；在搞好生产的前提下，体育工作与生产统一领导、统一布置、统一检查、统一总结、统一奖励。县委第一书记刘传友等领导同志以身作则，在检查生产、参加劳动的同时，和社员们一起参加体育活动，对群众鼓舞很大。同时，各生产队普遍推广了张秋公社的经验，每逢下田劳动，作到军事训练到田，体育器材到田，使生产、军训、体育拧成一股绳，很受群众欢迎。人们兴高彩烈地唱道：“劳动生产劲头足，体育活动是休息，来回路上练步伐，生产空隙练射击”，出现了不遵守劳动纪律的少，有病的少，村里村外闲人少；出勤的人多，参加训练的人多，爱演唱的人多的新局面。由于体育活动的开展和人们坚持了经常训练，全县发病率由公社成立前的4．5％，下降到0．9％；劳动出勤率由89％提高到99％。在今年抗旱斗争中，把手旗通讯、灯光通讯、无线电、土广播、摩托车等带到田间指挥生产，起了很大作用，使全县百万亩小麦普浇一至三次水，每亩追标准肥六、七千斤，胜利地渡过了小麦返青关、拔节关和灌浆关。同时，国防体育与民兵训练紧密结合起来，例如经过训练的无线电报务员、航海运动员、摩托车手、航空模型运动员分别编成民兵中的通讯兵、水兵、摩托兵、航空兵等，为国防建设培养了后备兵员。去年有二十名无线电报务员应征当了通讯兵，台前公社十二名摩托手有四名应征到装甲部队服役。
    我们所以能取得以上的成绩，基本原因在于党中央和毛主席指示的英明正确，在于国家体委和省、地委加强了对我们的领导。但我们的工作离党的要求和形势发展的需要还相差很远，我们决心更高地举起毛泽东军事思想的红旗，以不断革命的精神，继续前进，使体育运动更好地为增强人民体质，为建设和保卫我们伟大的祖国服务。
