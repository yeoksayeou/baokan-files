    Salespersons Must Be Knowledgeable
    Wei Shuqin, Salesperson, Harbin No. 7 Department Store
    Chairman Mao said in "On Practice": "A person's knowledge consists of two portions only, that of direct experience and that of indirect experience." Therefore, on the one hand, we must study the knowledge in books, that is, the experience of our predecessors and others; on the other hand, we must be good at summarizing our own work experience.
    As the ancients said, "When three men are walking together, there is sure to be one who can act as my teacher." This saying is very true. It shows that everyone has a certain amount of knowledge. No matter what kind of work you do, you may know more about this aspect than others, while they may know more about another aspect than you do. Salespersons do not know how to build houses, and house builders do not know sales procedures. Obviously, house builders have the knowledge of house building, and salespersons have the knowledge of sales; there are different specialized knowledge in different jobs. Although there are many kinds of knowledge, generally speaking, they are nothing more than what Chairman Mao said: there are two branches of knowledge in the world, one is the knowledge of class struggle, and the other is the knowledge of the struggle for production. It can be said that these two branches of knowledge are essential for everyone.
    Knowledge can never be completely learned by one person, even any professional knowledge cannot be fully mastered by one person. Because with the development of production and the progress of society, knowledge is constantly enriched and perfected. Precisely because of this, everyone must make unremitting efforts to learn any kind of knowledge. Even the knowledge of a salesperson is the same, there is no end to learning. It is wrong to say that there is nothing to learn about the knowledge of a salesperson, or to think that you have completely mastered the knowledge of a salesperson and there is no need to learn. If you really don't learn, then you will definitely fall behind. In short, knowledge is endless, and you must never be complacent or stop learning at any time. Chairman Mao said: "The enemy of learning is one's own complacency. To learn something seriously, one must start from not being complacent." We must always remember this sentence.
    In the old society, we proletarians had very few opportunities to learn, because the bourgeoisie turned knowledge into a tool for them to rule the so-called lower classes. The bourgeois rulers tried every means to carry out enslavement education for the laborers, or simply did not allow you to acquire knowledge at all. In other words, they were afraid that the laborers would acquire knowledge and see the truth, because once the laborers saw the ugly face of the bourgeoisie, they would immediately overthrow their rule. Just as Lenin said at the First All-Russian Congress on Education: "The working people are thirsting for knowledge, because knowledge is necessary for them to win victory. Nine-tenths of the working masses already understand that knowledge is their weapon for liberation, that they have suffered setbacks because of a lack of education, and now it is entirely up to them to ensure that everyone can truly receive education." This shows how important knowledge is to everyone. Without knowledge, there are no weapons, and you cannot liberate yourself, nor can you get rid of backwardness and poverty. Stalin also said at the Eighth Congress of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League that if the working class "does not master science; if it does not know how to manage the economy according to scientific principles, then it cannot truly become the master of the country"; "To build, one must have knowledge, one must master science. And to have knowledge, one must learn. Learn tenaciously, patiently, and learn from everyone." This shows that it is impossible not to learn. We as salespersons must also learn tenaciously and patiently. We must learn culture, we must learn theory, we must learn professional skills. Without learning, we cannot better serve the people, and we cannot truly become the masters of the country.
    Some people think that being a salesperson is just selling goods, and that it is enough to know the names, brands, and unit prices of the goods. Whether you learn or not, you still sell goods. As for learning theory, this kind of thinking is even more prominent. Is this really the case? Of course not. Especially the countless facts since the Great Leap Forward have proved this point. With the continuous development of society and the improvement of the people's material and cultural living standards, for us salespersons, the idea of simply selling goods can no longer meet the current needs, and we must work hard to learn and make the work of salespersons adapt to the needs of social development. In the past, it was selling goods, but now we need to establish political viewpoints, production viewpoints, and mass viewpoints in sales activities. We must not only sell goods, but also understand and be familiar with some business links in sales, such as: sales skills, language arts, studying the purchasing power level of the people, the laws of change in needs, participating in business management, and so on. We must not only be salespersons, but also become propagandists of the party's political and economic life; we must not only be able to sell goods, but also understand the performance, construction principles, processing and modification, production processes, and other knowledge of the goods. In addition, we must establish a communist style and become ideal salespersons and little experts for customers. All of these are the knowledge that we as socialist commercial salespersons should possess, so sales work also has a lot of knowledge, which requires us to carefully study and research.
    Since the Great Leap Forward, many workers and peasants, including us salespersons, have begun to study philosophy. Facts have proved that they can not only learn but also learn very well, and they can also write articles and even become lecturers to teach philosophy to others. In the past, probably no one would have believed this, but today it has become an undeniable fact. There are many such examples among us salespersons. For example, some comrades have improved their ideological awareness and work ability by learning, examining the shortcomings in their past work, and summarizing the experience in their work. In the past, one comrade, in order to welcome "May Day", saw that other stores were selling balloons very quickly, and came back and asked the purchasing agent to order 10,000 of them. As a result, they were not sold and all deteriorated, causing great losses to the country. Did she not want to do a good job? No. She was wholeheartedly trying to do a good job, but the result was the opposite, and she could not find the reason, and she was also very distressed. If you have theoretical knowledge and are good at analysis, you can avoid some mistakes in your work, and even if you make mistakes, you can find the reasons, so as to learn from the lessons and avoid making them again in the future. This comrade realized after studying that she had made a subjective error due to a lack of investigation and research. Therefore, if you want to do a good job and make fewer or no mistakes, you must study theory, transform your own thinking, and make your own thinking better conform to objective reality. This is the reason why we particularly emphasize the study of theory.
    So, how exactly do you learn? I have the following two personal experiences for comrades to refer to.
    First, implement the principle of combining culture, theory, and business. Our study is mainly in work, in spare-time schools or in various groups. There is an important issue here, which is that we must implement the principle of combining culture, theory, and business. How to combine them? Some people say: Salespersons stand in front of the counter all day long, where do they have time to learn so much! Through the Great Leap Forward, it has been confirmed that salespersons not only have time, but also have plenty of time to learn these things very well. The salespersons in many stores study culture in the morning on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, study philosophy in the morning on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, study business in the evening, summarize the work of the day, and find ways to learn from books, from millions of salespersons, from the general customers, and from factory workers. Therefore, they have greatly improved in culture, theory, and business, and a new atmosphere has emerged in their work.
    Second, implement the principle of learning for application. Learning is for application, so we must combine what we learn with our work. For example, when we learn that all objective things are independent of people's will, we go to analyze the actions and behaviors of customers in order to understand why some customers concentrate their attention on a certain commodity when they walk to the counter and are unwilling to leave: it turns out that this is the effect of material reflection, that is, the commodity is reflected in the person's mind, and the customer is interested in this commodity. Therefore, we must take the initiative to take out the commodity and show it to the customer, and say: "Comrade, please take a look at it. It doesn't matter if you don't buy it. Come back and buy it when you need it in the future. Prepare your mind first." Some customers really don't buy the commodity, but they also buy it after our publicity and explanation. Because some commodities were not understood by the customers before, but after our publicity and explanation, the customers realized that this commodity is needed for themselves. But this is not simply for sales, but to explain and publicize the commodity truthfully according to the needs of the customers. Chairman Mao said in "Must Learn to Do Economic Work": There is one problem that must be brought to everyone's attention again, that is, our thinking must be adapted to the environment in which we are currently located, that is, we must determine the working policy according to objective and actual conditions. This tells us that we must conduct specific analysis of specific problems. For a salesperson, they should work according to the needs of the customers. Chairman Mao's instruction made us further value the study of sales laws and customer psychology. We not only observe and understand the psychology of customers in front of the counter, but even when walking, taking the bus, attending meetings, and in all entertainment venues, we must pay attention to observing people's clothing, shoes, hats, and other hobbies, and conduct analysis and research. We salespersons all clearly realize in our minds that we are not selling goods to make money, but to meet the needs of the masses, so we try every means to expand sales and try every means to meet the needs of the people.

    售货员要有学问
    哈尔滨市第七百货商店售货员  魏淑琴
    毛主席在“实践论”中说：“一个人的知识，不外直接经验的和间接经验的两部分。”因此我们一方面要学习书本上的知识，即先人的和别人的经验；一方面还要善于总结我们自己的工作经验。
    古人说得好，“三人行，必有我师焉”。这句话是很有道理的。它说明了每个人都是有一定的知识的，不管你从事任何一项工作，你在这个方面比他人的知识多，他在另一方面又会比你的知识多。售货员不懂得怎样盖楼房，盖楼房的不懂得售货规程。显然，盖楼房的有盖楼房的学问，售货员有售货的学问；在不同的工作当中有着不同的专门知识。虽然知识的种类很多，总的说来不外毛主席说的：世界上的知识有两门，一门是阶级斗争的知识，一门是生产斗争的知识。可以说这两门知识对任何一个人来说都是必不可少的。
    知识对一个人来讲是永远学不完的，就是任何一门专业知识，对于一个人来说，也不会有学到家的时候。因为随着生产的发展和社会的进步，知识也在不断地丰富和完善。正因为这样，任何一个人对于任何一门知识都要不懈地努力学习。就是营业员这套知识，同样没有学完的时候。如果说营业员这套知识没啥学的，或者认为自己已经完全掌握了营业员的知识，用不着学了，那是错误的。如果你真的不学了，那你就一定会落后。总之，知识是无穷无尽的，在任何时候都不能自满，不能不学。毛主席说：“学习的敌人是自己的满足，要认真学习一点东西，必须从不自满开始。”我们要永远记住这句话。
    在旧社会，我们无产阶级很少有学习的机会，因为资产阶级把知识变成他们统治所谓下等人的工具了。资产阶级统治者千方百计来对劳动者进行奴化教育，或根本不叫你获得知识。也就是说，他们害怕劳动者获得知识，看到真理，因为劳动者一旦看清资产阶级的丑恶面目，便立刻会打翻他们的统治。正像列宁在全俄教育工作第一次代表大会上所说的一样：“劳动者渴求知识，因为知识是他们获得胜利所必需的。十分之九的劳动群众已经懂得：知识是他们争取解放的武器，他们受到挫折就是因为缺少教育，现在要使大家都能真正受到教育是全靠他们自己的。”由此可见，知识对于每一个人是多么重要，没有知识就是没有武器，就不能解放自己，就不能使自己摆脱落后和贫困的状况。斯大林在苏联列宁共产主义青年团第八次代表大会上也说过，如果工人阶级“不掌握科学；不善于根据科学的原则管理经济，那它就不能真正成为国家的主人”；“要建设，就必须有知识，必需掌握科学。而要有知识，就必须学习。顽强地、耐心地学习，向所有的人学习”。这就说明不学习是不行的。我们作营业员的也同样必须顽强地、耐心地学习。要学习文化，要学习理论，要学习业务技术，不学习，我们就不能更好地为人民服务，就不能真正成为国家的主人。
    有人认为，售货员就是卖货呗，认得品名、牌号、单价就行啦，学不学还不是一样卖货。至于提到学习理论，这种想法就更为突出。事实上是不是这样呢？当然不是。特别是通过大跃进以来的无数事实证明了这一点。随着社会的不断发展、人民物质文化生活水平的提高，对我们售货员来说，那种单纯卖货的想法，已经不能适应当前的需要，而必须努力学习，使售货员的工作和社会发展的需要相适应。过去是卖货，现在需要我们在售货活动中，树立起政治观点、生产观点、群众观点，不仅售货而且要懂得和熟悉售货当中的一些业务环节，如：售货技巧、语言艺术、研究人民的购买力水平、需要的变化规律、参与经营管理等等。不仅是当售货员，而且还要成为党的政治经济生活的宣传员；不仅要会卖商品，还要懂得商品的性能，构造原理，加工改制，生产过程等知识。除此之外，还要树立共产主义风格，成为人民理想的售货员和顾客的小专家。所有这些，都是我们作为社会主义商业售货员所应具备的知识，所以售货工作也是有很多学问的，需要我们认真加以学习和研究。
    大跃进以来，很多的工人、农民，其中也包括我们售货员，开始学习哲学。事实证明，不仅能学而且还学习得很好，还能写文章，甚至还当了讲师，给别人去讲哲学。这在过去大概不会有人相信，可是今天已经成了千真万确的事实了。在我们售货员中，这样的例子也很多。例如有的同志通过学习，检查了过去工作中的缺点，总结了工作中的经验，从而提高了思想觉悟和工作能力。过去有一个同志为迎接“五·一”，看别的商店气球卖得很快，回来就叫进货员进一万个，结果没有销出去，都变质了，给国家造成了很大损失。是不是她不想干好呢？不是的。她一心一意的想干好，但干的结果却相反，而且还找不出原因来，自己也很苦恼。如果有理论知识，善于分析，就可以避免工作中的一些错误，即使出了错误也能找出原因来，从而吸取教训，避免今后再犯。这个同志就是在学习以后，才认识到她是由于缺乏调查研究，犯了主观主义的错误。所以，要想把工作干好，少犯或不犯错误，就必须学习理论，改造自己的思想，使自己的思想更好地符合于客观实际。这就是我们特别强调学习理论的理由。
    那么，到底怎样学呢？我个人的体会有以下两点，供同志们参考。
    一、贯彻文化、理论、业务三结合的原则。我们的学习，主要是在工作中学习，在业余学校或各种小组中学习。这里有一个重要的问题，就是必须贯彻文化、理论、业务三结合的原则。如何结合呢？有的人说：售货员一天从早到晚都站在柜台前，哪有时间学习那么多呀！通过大跃进，证实了售货员不仅有时间，而且还有充足的时间把这些东西学得很好。很多商店的售货员，他们一、三、五早晨上文化课，二、四、六早晨就学哲学，晚上就研究业务，总结一天的工作，并找出了向书本学、向千百万售货员学、向广大顾客学、向工厂工人学的途径。因此，不管在文化上、理论上、业务上都有很大提高，在工作上也出现了新的气象。
    二、贯彻学以致用的原则。学是为了用，所以必须把学习的东西和工作结合起来。比方我们学习到一切客观事物是不依赖人们的意志为转移的时候，就去分析顾客的举动行为，才能懂得为什么有的顾客走到柜台前会把视线集中到某种商品上，而不愿再走：原来这是物质反映的作用，就是商品反映到人的脑子里，顾客对这种商品有了兴趣。因此，我们就要主动地把商品拿出给顾客看，并说：“同志请随便看一看，不买没啥，以后用时再来买，先做思想准备。”也有的顾客确实是不买商品，但经过我们宣传解释后也买了。因为有的商品原来顾客不了解，经我们的宣传解释后，使顾客了解到这种商品为自己所需要。但这绝不是单纯地为了推销，而是根据顾客的需要实事求是地去解释和宣传商品。毛主席在“必须学会做经济工作”一文里说：有一个问题必须再一次引起大家的注意，就是我们的思想要适合于目前我们所处的环境，这就是说，必须按着客观实际情况决定工作方针。这就告诉我们，要对具体问题进行具体分析。对于一个售货员来说，应该根据顾客的需要，来进行工作。毛主席的这一指示，使我们更进一步地重视研究售货规律和顾客心理，不仅在柜台前观察和了解顾客的心理，甚至在走路、坐车、开会和一切娱乐场所里，我们都要去注意观察人们的服装、鞋帽等爱好，并进行分析研究。我们售货员在思想上都明确认识到，我们不是为了赚钱而售货，而是为了满足群众需要而售货，所以才千方百计地扩大销售和千方百计地满足人民的需要。
