To the Editorial Comrades of a Bookstore That Enthusiastically Serves Readers:

    The Xinhua Bookstore in Gulou District, Nanjing, is a service department with a communist spirit. In their work, they exhaust all means and spare no effort to make things convenient for readers.

    Not long ago, our school was studying Chairman Mao's works, and before proceeding to the lesson on "On Contradiction," we urgently wanted to purchase a popular reference material, "How to Study On Contradiction" (compiled by Xu Ti), to better help the students understand. This book was published by Jiangsu Publishing House in Nanjing, so we wrote a letter requesting the Nanjing Gulou District Xinhua Bookstore to try to purchase and mail it on our behalf. Who knew that the book had long been out of stock? After receiving our letter, the bookstore contacted all the local bookstores, but they could not find the book. Finally, they checked at the Nanjing Library, but the library only had one copy, which could not be sold. In this situation, the comrade in charge of the store organized the staff to hand-copy a copy during their spare time. The book contained 64,000 characters, and they copied it with clear handwriting, with the table of contents and chapters accurate to the last word and sentence, even redrawing the illustrations.

    When this book was delivered to us by airmail, the students were moved for a long time and could not calm down. Everyone praised it one after another, saying that they would make the greatest efforts to seriously study Chairman Mao's works to repay the help of these comrades.

专栏：读者来信

    一个热心为读者服务的书店编辑同志：
    南京市鼓楼区新华书店，是一个具有共产主义风格的服务部门，他们在业务上想尽办法，不惜一切，为读者找方便。
    不久前，我校在学习毛主席著作，进行到“矛盾论”一课前，为了更好地帮助学生们理解，急欲购一本通俗参考资料“怎样学矛盾论”（编者徐替），这本书系南京江苏出版社出版，因此，我们写信请求南京鼓楼区新华书店设法代购并邮寄。谁知这本书早已缺售，该店接到我们的去信后，向当地所有的书店都联系过了，也没有买到这本书。最后，他们到南京图书馆查询，但该馆只有一本不能出售。在这种情况下，该店的负责同志，便组织店内的工作人员利用业余时间照抄了一本。这本书共六万四千字，他们抄得字迹清晰，目录、章节一字、一句不错，甚至连附图也照画了下来。
    这本书，经过航空邮寄送到我们的手中时，学员们被感动得久久不能平静下来，大家你一言我一语赞不绝口，都表示要用最大的努力认真学习毛主席著作，来回答这些同志的帮助。
