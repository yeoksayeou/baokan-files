Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 25th. The latest issue of the Indian "New Century" weekly published an article commenting on the performance of the Indian Congress Party and People's Socialist Party coalition government in Kerala over the past four months, saying that the direction this government is taking is that "the hungry will become even hungrier, the unemployed will never find work, and the laws and regulations only benefit the followers chosen by the ruling party."

The article pointed out that the current Kerala government has completely changed the main policies implemented by the previous government led by the Indian Communist Party in four months.

The article listed facts saying that the current Kerala government had announced that it would do its utmost to restore police rule, allowing the landed gentry and wealthy people in the countryside, as well as members of the Congress Party and People's Socialist Party, to manipulate the law in their own hands. These people have direct contact with police officers and even ministers, and can direct police actions.

The article said that in Kerala, landlords in many places have reclaimed leased land. Many farmers' houses have been demolished, and their families driven away. Local Congress Party leaders directly helped this terror campaign. Communists and sympathizers were attacked and even killed.

The article said that the state government has also changed the cooperative policy of the previous government led by the Communist Party, giving the benefits of the cooperatives to the upper classes.

According to reports in local newspapers, the Kerala Legislative Assembly on the 23rd, despite the opposition of Communist Party members, also passed a bill to temporarily repeal Article 11 of the Education Act formulated by the former state government regarding the appointment of teachers before January 1, 1961.

The "New Century" weekly pointed out in this article that the reason why this provision, which is conducive to helping backward villages in the appointment of teachers, is to be temporarily repealed, is the result of huge pressure exerted on the state government by vested interest groups and the "Nair Service Society."

The "New Century" weekly article said that the Kerala government has revoked cases related to the atrocities of the anti-communist "Liberation Struggle" organization. During the presidential takeover after the Communist Party-led state government was dissolved, 2,700 illegal cases were revoked. After the formation of the coalition government, another 273 cases of infringement of personal and property rights were revoked. However, cases against Communists continue to be retained. The article said that the state government has begun to persecute those who refuse to follow the leaders of the Congress Party and the People's Socialist Party. About thirty people have been ordered to be suspended from their duties by the police bureau and other departments. Under the rule of the current government, incidents of dismissing government officials or demoting and transferring them on a large scale out of partisan considerations have become commonplace.

The article said that in today's Kerala, candidates for government positions must undergo police screening. It also said that in the four months since the new state government took office, the prices of food and other consumer goods have risen, and murders and thefts have also increased greatly.

### 印度“新世纪”周报载文揭露  喀拉拉邦政府对人民权利大举进攻  地主仗势收回租地　许多农民家屋被毁　共产党人受到迫害

    印度“新世纪”周报载文揭露
    喀拉拉邦政府对人民权利大举进攻
    地主仗势收回租地　许多农民家屋被毁　共产党人受到迫害
    新华社新德里25日电　最近一期的印度“新世纪”周报著文评论印度喀拉拉邦国大党和人民社会党联合政府的四个月来的施政情况时说，这个政府所走的方向是，“饥饿的人还会更饥饿，失业者决不会找到工作，法律规章只有利于执政党挑选的追随者”。
    文章指出，喀拉拉邦现政府在四个月期间完全改变了由印度共产党领导的前政府所推行的主要政策。
    文章列举事实说，目前的喀拉拉邦政府曾经宣布，它将竭力恢复警察统治，使乡下的有土地的绅士和有钱人以及国大党人和人民社会党人把法律操纵在自己的手中。这些人同警官、甚至同部长有直接的接触，可以指使警察的行动。
    文章说，在喀拉拉邦，许多地方的地主都收回了租地。许多农民的房屋被拆毁，他们的家庭被赶走。当地的国大党领袖直接帮助了这种恐怖运动。共产党员和同情者受到打击，甚至遭到杀害。
    文章说，邦政府还改变了共产党领导的前政府的合作社政策，把合作社的利益给予上层阶级。
    另据这里的报纸报道，喀拉拉邦立法会议在23日还不顾共产党议员的反对，通过一项法案，要在1961年1月1日以前把前邦政府制订的教育法中关于任命教师的第十一条暂时作废。
      “新世纪”周报在这篇文章中指出，这一条在任命教师方面有利于帮助落后乡村的规定所以要被暂时作废，是既得利益集团和“奈尔服务社”对邦政府施加巨大压力的结果。
    “新世纪”周报的文章说，喀拉拉邦政府已经撤销了同反共的“解放斗争”组织的暴行有关的案件。在共产党领导的邦政府被解散以后的总统接管期间，曾经撤销了二千七百起违法的案件。在联合政府成立以后，又撤销了二百七十三起关于侵犯人身和财产的案件。但是反对共产党人的案件却继续被保留。文章说，邦政府已经开始迫害那些拒绝跟随国大党和人民社会党的头子走的人。已经有大约三十人被警察局和其他部门命令停职。在现政府的统治下，出于党派的考虑而解雇政府官员或把他们降级和大规模调动的事件已经成为家常便饭。
    文章说，在今天的喀拉拉邦，候选人在政府中就职要经过警察甄别。它还说，在新邦政府执政的四个月中，食品和其他消费品的价格都已上涨，谋杀案和偷盗案也大为增加。
