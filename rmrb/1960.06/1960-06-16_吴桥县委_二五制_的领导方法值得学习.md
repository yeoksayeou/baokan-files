    The Leadership Method of the Wuqiao County Party Committee's "Two-Five System" is Worth Learning
    The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently promoted throughout the province a new and effective leadership method from Wuqiao County, the "Two-Five System" leadership method. The specific content of this leadership method is that within a week, the county party committee, the commune party committee, and the management district general branch (including county and commune departments) each spend two days holding meetings, inspecting and studying work, and studying; and five days going to the production teams (factories, workshops, grassroots stores) to participate in production, lead production, and specifically help grassroots cadres solve problems in production and work. This leadership method has not only been universally implemented in Hebei Province, but is also being promoted in many other places across the country. Facts have fully proven that the "Two-Five System" is a very good leadership method and is well worth learning by party committees below the county level throughout the country.
    Under the situation of continued overall leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, all tasks are changing with each passing day, requiring the broad masses of cadres to lead production more deeply, carry out work more effectively, and improve their political and theoretical level better. This means that leadership style and leadership methods must adapt to the current excellent situation. The implementation of the "Two-Five System" leadership method by party committees below the county level is a result of adapting to the needs of the new situation. It is a new achievement in implementing the Party's principle of combining leadership with the masses under the new situation. Promoting the "Two-Five System" allows cadres to concentrate their main time, go deep into the masses, go deep into reality, go to the front line of production to personally lead production. Moreover, it allows cadres time to inspect, summarize, and study work, and time to study policies and theories. In the past, we have accumulated rich experience in improving leadership methods, such as "planting experimental fields," holding on-site meetings, cadres participating in labor, participating in production, and leading production, and so on. The "Two-Five System" leadership method systematically organizes and institutionalizes these effective experiences, and further enriches and improves them. It not only relatively properly solves the contradictions that exist in some aspects, such as too many meetings and too little contact with the masses; too many documents and reports and too few experience summaries; too much time spent in offices and too little serious investigation and research; too many affairs and too little study; too many general calls and too little detailed organization of work, etc.; but also relatively properly arranges the relationship between participating in labor, conducting investigations and research, summarizing experience, strengthening leadership, and studying theory, and reasonably fixes cadres' production, work, and study into a system. This is of great benefit to further developing rural production, improving cadres' ideological level, and improving cadres' work style.
    How should we lead production? Is it better to lead from an office or to lead by going into production? The experience of promoting the "Two-Five System" answers this question very well. The implementation of the "Two-Five System" ensures that more cadres can concentrate their main time and go down to the front line of production to participate in production and lead production, changing the situation where cadres at the county, commune, and management district levels spend too much time in offices. The personal participation in production by these three levels of cadres can greatly promote and educate team cadres to participate in production. The direct participation and leadership of production by the broad masses of cadres can further stimulate the production enthusiasm of the masses. More importantly, this will promote the broad masses of cadres to not only become ordinary laborers who eat, live, and work with the masses, but also become excellent production leaders who go deep into reality and deep into the masses. The Wuqiao County Party Committee stipulates that cadres, during their time in the production team, should adopt the working method of "turning around in the morning" (comprehensively checking the production work situation), "working during the daytime" (participating in production with the masses in the morning and afternoon), and "helping in the evening" (helping team cadres plan and arrange work, offering ideas, and thinking of solutions). In this way, cadres not only participate in production, but also lead production, and quickly solve problems in production. Comrade Mao Zedong said, "In all practical work of our Party, all correct leadership must be from the masses, to the masses." Only when cadres participate in production and mingle with the masses can they change the situation of vagueness and seeing flowers in a fog, personally experience the problems in production, listen to the voices of the masses, and concentrate the wisdom of the masses to help grassroots cadres propose practical and feasible solutions. This is the process of coming from the masses and going to the masses. Some people believe that if cadres participate in production, they will not be able to do their work. The facts in Wuqiao County have dispelled this concern. In the two months of promoting the "Two-Five System" in Wuqiao County, two thousand five hundred and forty-four cadres not only completed a total of sixty-nine thousand two hundred plus working days, but also powerfully promoted the particularly high production upsurge in the county. The peasant masses praised them, saying, "Cadres' speeches have become peasants' speeches," and "principle cadres" have become "concrete cadres." In production labor, the broad masses of cadres have also established deep feelings with the working peasants, which has also played a great role in transforming and improving their own thinking and improving their leadership work ability. All of this shows that the implementation of the "Two-Five System" can enable cadres to be active on the front line of production, mingle with the working people, always maintain revolutionary vigor and creative spirit, and ensure good leadership of production and promote continuous leap forward in production.
    The implementation of the "Two-Five System" leadership method can better reflect Comrade Mao Zedong's mass line working method of "from the masses, to the masses; concentrate, persevere." Only after cadres of higher-level organs go deep into the masses and understand the situation is it possible to concentrate the demands of the masses, and, after research, transform them into concentrated and systematic opinions, and then go to the masses to do propaganda and explanation, transform them into the opinions of the masses, and persevere. Then concentrate again from the masses and persevere to the masses again. In this era of great leap forward, things are developing rapidly, and new situations, new problems, and new experiences are constantly emerging, which must be studied, sorted out, and summarized in a timely manner to find out the laws of the development of things. The task of leadership work is to discover and solve problems in a timely and effective manner, summarize new experiences in a timely manner, and promote them in a timely manner to guide work and ensure better leap forward in work. The "Two-Five System" leadership method in Wuqiao County correctly solves this problem. It stipulates that cadres at the county, commune, and management district levels should use five days to go deep into the production team, and also have two days to return to the leadership organ for everyone to conduct collective learning and collective research on how to lead the overall work well, with both division of labor and responsibility and centralized leadership. Each time they are concentrated in the leadership organ, everyone timely sorts out and improves the situation and problems they have learned about each time, exchange information and exchange experiences, jointly discuss and study problems, summarize experiences, and jointly study specific methods to continue implementing the Party's policies and guidelines. When cadres go deeper, they may be able to better guide work. This concentration, persistence, and endless cycle can continuously improve our work, making it more correct, deeper, more vivid, and richer each time. In this way, the work of the leading organs has been greatly improved, the quality of meetings has been improved, the number and time of meetings have been reduced; the quality of documents has also been improved, the number of documents has also been reduced, and the number of reports has also been greatly reduced; the effectiveness of leadership work has been improved, and the enthusiasm and creativity of cadres has also been improved. Of course, this is a new leadership system, and at the beginning of its implementation, some people may feel unaccustomed to coming up and down. However, should that kind of situation of being divorced from the masses, divorced from reality, and being busy and chaotic in the organs all day long be what we are accustomed to? Not at all. Chairman Mao wants us to wash our faces every day, just so as not to be contaminated with even a little bit of bureaucratic work style. The broad masses of cadres have done so, and their work has achieved very good results. Now it is a hundred feet pole, a step further. The implementation of the "Two-Five System" leadership method ensures that more cadres can use more time to go deep into the masses, participate in labor, and implement specific guidance, while using a certain amount of time to study and summarize in the organs. This is a normal leadership order, and we should fully get used to this scientific leadership method.
    The "Two-Five System" leadership method not only gives cadres time to participate in production and lead production, but also gives them time to hold meetings and study and summarize work, and also gives them time to study the Party's policies and study theory. Cadres in Wuqiao County can take some time each week to study policies and theories. They combine the study of Mao Zedong's works, the study of the Party's guidelines and policies, and investigation and research work to better achieve the combination of theory and practice, so that work and study can promote and drive each other. This can more quickly cultivate and improve the ideological and theoretical level and professional work level of cadres. It should be admitted that the three levels of cadres in our counties, communes, and management districts have made great progress since the Great Leap Forward. Their hard work and leadership ability have gradually improved, and they have played a huge role in the overall leap forward in rural work, but the improvement of the working ability of many of them still cannot keep up with the needs of the new situation, which requires them to work hard to go deep into reality and deep into the masses to improve practical experience, and on the other hand, requires them to work hard to study policies and learn theories to improve policy level and theoretical level. In the case of very tense practical work, the three levels of cadres in counties, communes, and management districts are busy all day long, and the easiest thing to be squeezed out is study. Many comrades always think that they are busy with work and have no way to study. The experience of Wuqiao County proves that grassroots cadres can learn very well in busy work. The problem is to have the correct leadership method, that is, to correctly arrange the time for grassroots cadres' work, labor, and study. After the "Two-Five System" leadership method was implemented, it proved that in busy work, not only should we study, but we can also study very well, because this method of both going deep and concentrating up is a good method of closely combining work and study and closely combining theory and practice. The more cadres need to carry out in-depth leadership work, the more urgently they need to study. Because they personally feel that only by strengthening study, only by arming their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, can they continuously solve the problems raised in practice. And only by combining the current urgent problems to be solved to carry out study can we enhance the confidence and effectiveness of study.
    The "Two-Five System" leadership method is a very good way to adapt to the development of productive forces and adjust production relations. It is applicable to party committees and government departments at all levels below the county. Of course, the "Two-Five System" leadership method can be applied to different regions and different industries, and can be tailored to people, time, and place, and can be "three-seven system," "two-eight system," and so on. Attention should be paid to learning some of the most basic experiences of the "Two-Five System" in reflecting the Party's leadership methods. With the continued leap forward in agricultural production and the consolidation and improvement of people's communes, we should continuously sweep away bureaucratic dust, create new leadership experiences based on the Marxist worldview and methodology, further improve leadership methods, and continuously improve leadership levels.

### 吴桥县委“二五制”的领导方法值得学习

    吴桥县委“二五制”的领导方法值得学习
    中共河北省委最近在全省推广了吴桥县委行之有效的一个新的领导方法——“二五制”的领导方法。这个领导方法的具体内容是，在一周以内，县委、公社党委、管理区总支（包括县、公社各部门），分别以两天时间，各自开会、检查研究工作和学习；以五天时间深入到生产小队（工厂、车间、基层商店）去参加生产、领导生产，具体帮助基层干部解决生产和工作中的问题。这种领导方法不只是在河北省全省普遍推行了，全国其他不少地方也正在推行。事实已经充分证明，“二五制”是一种很好的领导方法，很值得全国县以下的党委学习。
    在工农业生产继续全面跃进的形势下，各项工作日新月异，要求广大干部必须更深入地领导生产，更有成效地进行工作，更好地提高政治理论水平。这就是说，领导作风、领导方法必须同当前的大好形势相适应。县以下的党委实行“二五制”的领导方法，就是适应新的形势的需要而产生的。它是在新形势下执行党的领导与群众相结合的原则的新成果。推行“二五制”，就可以使干部集中主要时间，深入群众，深入实际，走上生产第一线去亲自领导生产，不仅如此，还可以使干部有时间检查、总结和研究工作，有时间学政策和理论。过去我们在改进领导方法方面已经取得了丰富的经验，比如“种试验田”、开现场会、干部参加劳动、参加生产、领导生产，等等。“二五制”的领导方法，正是把这些行之有效的好经验，加以系统化和制度化，并进一步充实和提高。它不仅比较妥善地解决了在某些方面存在的会议多，联系群众少；文件、表报多，经验总结少；蹲在机关多，认真调查研究少；事务多，学习少；一般号召多，细致地组织工作少，等等矛盾；而且比较妥善地安排了参加劳动、调查研究、总结经验、加强领导和学习理论等方面彼此间的关系，把干部的生产、工作、学习比较合理地固定成制度。这对于进一步发展农村生产，提高干部思想水平，改进干部工作作风，都有很大好处。
    应当怎样领导生产呢？蹲在机关里领导好？还是到生产中去领导好？“二五制”推行的经验，很好地回答了这个问题。推行了“二五制”，保证了更多的干部能够集中主要的时间扎扎实实地深入生产前线，参加生产，领导生产，改变了县、公社和管理区三级干部蹲在机关多的情况。这三级干部亲自参加生产，可以大大推动和教育小队干部参加生产。广大干部直接参加和领导生产，更可以激发群众的生产热情。更重要的是，这将促使广大干部不仅成为与群众同吃同住同劳动的普通劳动者，而且成为深入实际深入群众的优秀的生产领导者。中共吴桥县委规定干部在深入生产小队的期间，采取早晨起来转（全面检查生产工作情况），正当时间干（上下午与群众一同参加生产），晚上帮（晚上帮助队干部计划安排工作，出主意，想办法）的工作方法。这样一来，干部既参加了生产，又领导了生产，迅速解决了生产中的问题。毛泽东同志说，“在我党的一切实际工作中，凡属正确的领导，必须是从群众中来，到群众中去。”干部只有参加了生产，同群众打成一片，才能改变若明若暗、雾里看花的情况，亲身体会到生产中的问题、倾听到群众的声音，并且能集中群众的智慧，帮助基层干部提出切实可行的解决问题的办法。这就是从群众中来，到群众中去的过程。有人认为，干部参加了生产，就做不了工作。吴桥县的事实打破了这种顾虑。吴桥县推行“二五制”两个月中，二千五百四十四名干部，不只是一共完成了六万九千二百多个劳动日，而且有力地推动了全县特别高涨的生产高潮，农民群众赞扬道，“干部讲话变成了农民话，”“原则干部”变成了“具体干部”。广大干部在生产劳动中，还同劳动农民建立了深厚的感情，对改造和提高自己的思想，提高自己的领导工作能力，也起了很大的作用。所有这些都说明，实行“二五制”，可以使干部活跃在生产的最前线，同劳动人民打成一片，永远保持革命朝气和创造精神，能够保证领导好生产，促使生产不断跃进。
    推行“二五制”的领导方法，可以更好地体现毛泽东同志的“从群众中来，到群众中去；集中起来，坚持下去”的群众路线的工作方法。上级机关的干部只有在深入群众，了解情况以后，才有可能把群众的要求集中起来，经过研究，化为集中的系统的意见，又向群众去做宣传解释，化为群众的意见，并且坚持下去。然后再从群众中集中起来，再向群众坚持下去。在这大跃进的年代里，事物发展很快，新情况、新问题、新经验不断产生，必须及时研究、整理、总结，找出事物发展的规律。领导工作的任务是，及时有效地发现问题和解决问题，及时总结出新的经验，及时推广出去，用以指导工作，保证工作更好地跃进。吴桥县的“二五制”领导方法，正确解决了这个问题。它规定县、公社和管理区三级干部要用五天的时间分工深入到生产小队，还要有两天时间回到领导机关，大家进行集体学习和集体研究如何领导好全面的工作，既有分工负责，又有集中领导。在每次集中到领导机关的时候，每个人把每次了解到的情况和问题及时加以整理和提高，互相交流情况、交换经验，共同讨论和研究问题，总结经验，共同研究出继续贯彻党的政策方针的具体办法。干部再深入下去时，就可能更好地指导工作。这样集中起来、坚持下去，循环不已，就可以使我们的工作不断提高，一次比一次更正确，更深入，更生动，更丰富。这样一来，领导机关的工作就大为改善了，会议的质量提高了，开会的次数和时间都少了；文件的质量也提高了，文件的数量也减少了，表报的数量也大大减少了；领导工作的成效提高了，干部的积极性和创造性也提高了。当然，这是一个新的领导制度，在开始实行的时候，也可能有人感到上来下去，不习惯。可是，那种脱离群众，脱离实际，整日在机关忙忙乱乱的状况，难道就应该是我们习惯的吗？一点也不。毛主席要我们天天洗脸，就是为了不沾染哪怕是一点点的官僚主义作风的习惯。广大干部是这样做了，他们的工作都取得了很好的成绩。现在是百尺竿头，更进一步。推行“二五制”的领导方法，保证更多的干部能用更多的时间深入群众，参加劳动，实行具体指导，同时用一定的时间在机关研究、总结。这是正常的领导秩序，我们完全应当习惯这种科学的领导方法。
    “二五制”的领导方法，不仅使干部有了参加生产、领导生产的时间，也不仅有了开会、研究总结工作的时间，还有了学习党的政策和学习理论的时间。吴桥县的干部每周都可以抽出一定时间学习政策和学习理论，他们把学习毛泽东著作，学习党的方针、政策和调查研究工作结合起来，更好地做到了理论与实际相结合，使工作和学习互相促进，互相推动。这就可以更快地培养和提高干部的思想理论水平和业务工作水平。应该承认，我们县、公社和管理 区的三级干部，在大跃进以来有很大的进步，他们的辛勤努力和领导能力逐步提高，对农村工作的全面跃进起了巨大的作用，但是他们中很多人的工作能力的提高仍然赶不上新形势的需要，一方面要求他们努力深入实际，深入群众，提高实践经验，另一方面又要求他们努力学习政策学习理论，提高政策水平和理论水平。在实际工作十分紧张的情况下，县、公社和管理区三级干部整天忙碌，最容易被挤掉的就是学习，很多同志也总认为工作繁忙，没有办法进行学习。吴桥县的经验证明，基层干部在繁忙的工作当中，完全可以学得很好。问题是要有正确的领导方法，也就是要正确地安排基层干部的工作、劳动和学习的时间。“二五制”领导方法推行以后，证明在繁忙的工作当中，不仅应该学习，而且能够学习得很好，因为这样既能深入下去又能集中上来的办法，是工作和学习密切结合、是理论和实践密切结合的好办法。干部越要深入地进行领导工作，就越迫切要求学习。因为他们切身感到，只有加强学习，只有用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，才能不断解决实践当中提出来的问题。而且也只有结合当前迫切需要解决的问题来进行学习，才能增强学习的信心和学习的成效。
      “二五制”的领导方法，是适应生产力的发展，调整生产关系的一个很好的办法。它对于县以下各级党委、各政府部门都是适用的。当然，“二五制”的领导方法，运用到不同地区，不同行业，还可以因人、因时、因地制宜，可以“三七制”，“二八制”，等等。应当注意学习“二五制”在体现党的领导方法方面一些最基本的经验。随着农业生产的继续跃进，人民公社的巩固和提高，我们应该不断扫除官僚主义灰尘，依据马克思主义的世界观与方法论，创造新的领导经验，进一步改进领导方法，不断地提高领导水平。（这篇社论是河北日报编辑部和本报编辑部共同写作的）
