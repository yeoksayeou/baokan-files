	From Hell to Heaven
	--What I Saw in Wangjiapo, a National Model Health Unit
	By Our Correspondent Li Xiangtao

	Standing on the Liangyang Road in the mountain city of Chongqing and looking down, Wangjiapo, the nationally famous model health area, resembles a magnificent garden on the banks of the Yangtze River. More than six million trees form a lush and dense forest. Newly built buildings are exposed in the woods. Among the red buildings and green trees, there are more than a hundred gardens, with bursts of floral fragrance from time to time.

	In the residential area of Wangjiapo, the glass windows of every household are wiped bright, with curtains of various colors hanging on the windows and potted flowers on the window sills. Those living downstairs have also built small flower beds of various forms in front of their doors, planting cannas, monthly red and other flowers. Various furniture and sundries in the room are arranged in an orderly manner, and some families also have calligraphy and paintings on the pink walls.

	In the residential area, we visited the family of old lady Zheng Yongquan. Old lady Zheng Yongquan is an old resident of Wangjiapo. Before liberation, she gave birth to ten children, but nine of them were taken away by disease one after another. Now, when we talked to her about the environmental sanitation of today's Wangjiapo, she couldn't help but talk about the past with emotion. From the conversation of this old resident, the horrible scene of the old Wangjiapo, like a demon cave, appeared unpleasantly in front of us:

	Before liberation, Wangjiapo was a slum famous throughout Chongqing for its poverty, dirt, stench, and dilapidation. To the east was a garbage mountain specializing in accumulating dirt and filth, and to the west was a coffin slope with desolate graves. There were more than 30 stinking ditches in the area, flowing everywhere. The stench was everywhere, and passers-by could not help but cover their noses. At that time, poor people built "earth cage" houses among the graves, garbage heaps, and sewage ditches, struggling to survive. In winter, the northwest wind passed through the walls, and in summer, large-tailed maggots crawled directly onto the beds. Dysentery, cholera and other infectious diseases often plagued Wangjiapo. In the summer of 1949, when the infectious disease was the most serious, more than 60% of the residents of Wangjiapo were ill, and more than 500 people were killed by the plague. There was once a folk song that vividly depicted the scene of Wangjiapo at that time: Poor, dirty, smelly, and rotten Wangjiapo, corpses everywhere and a lot of feces and urine, garbage piled up like mountains and sewage rivers, the stench is unbearable, covering your nose as you pass, there are all kinds of bull demons and snakes, dark and terrifying coffin slope, if the plague comes, nine out of ten people will see the King of Hell.

	Now all this is gone forever. Residents enthusiastically praise today's Wangjiapo, saying: The red sun rises in the east, shining on Wangjiapo, the working people have turned themselves over, and from now on, hell becomes heaven.

	Zheng Yongquan and Wei Yunzhi, the director of culture and education of Wangjiapo Commune, accompanied us to visit Hongqi Street. The street is a three-earth road, planted with poplars on both sides, a spittoon every ten steps, and a trash can every twenty steps. The most striking thing is people's good habit of loving cleanliness and paying attention to hygiene. Although there are very few flies here, everyone can still be seen holding fly swatters. As we were walking, we suddenly saw a pedestrian spitting phlegm carelessly outside the spittoon. A Young Pioneer immediately ran over to wipe the phlegm clean with paper and made a polite suggestion. At this time, Grandma Zheng said with emotion: "Today's children pay more attention to hygiene than adults. A child named Zhao Zhiping near me, one day at noon, the family was eating lunch around the table, he pulled his grandfather's sleeve and wouldn't let him pick up the food. The adults asked him, and he said, why doesn't grandpa use public chopsticks?"

	We walked into the shopping area on the left, and we saw a neat row of shops, uniformly red walls and green counters. There were Xinhua Bookstore, department store outlets, libraries... In a room with a wooden sign hanging on it that read "Red Room", a large group of people were quietly reading books and newspapers. The walls were covered with poems and pictures. Director Wei said: "People's ways of resting have also changed. In the past, whenever they had free time, they would drink, gamble, and quarrel. Now, whenever they have free time, they read books, read newspapers, and write articles. The residents have also organized amateur cultural troupes, often rehearsing programs and performing dramas!"

	Behind Hongqi Street is the commune hospital. There are very few patients inside. We met the chief physician in the office. He introduced the health care situation here in detail: Wangjiapo not only did not have a hospital before liberation, but even did not have a medicine peddler. Now, a medical prevention network has been built here, with commune-run hospitals and all health stations (rooms). On average, one out of every five residents has a health worker who can treat minor injuries and illnesses. In addition, there are simple maternity hospitals, infant homes, and convalescent homes, specializing in taking care of pregnant women, children, the elderly, and patients. This residential area eliminated some major infectious diseases such as cholera and dysentery last year. The incidence rate among residents has dropped from 60% in the early days of liberation to 0.1%-0.2%, and everyone understands general health knowledge.

	We visited a nearby health station. The station was well-stocked with medicines. The health worker, Wang Yufen, was originally a housewife. In the past, she would ask Bodhisattva when she got sick. Now that she is a health worker, she has acquired the health knowledge level of a general hospital nurse. She said with a smile to us: "Now the health of the residents is getting better and better. There hasn't been a serious illness in a month or two." We flipped through the registration cards, which recorded in detail the past and present health status of each resident. Wang Yufen said: "With this, we can plan prevention and treatment. In the past, life and death were all in the hands of God. Now, we control our own destiny."

	Coming out of the health station, we met Tang Tingzhen, who used to be the director of the street, in the Party committee office. She gave us a detailed introduction to the transformation of Wangjiapo: After the democratic reform movement, people fought against bullies and foremen, and they felt very comfortable. At this time, some people discussed cleaning up the whole slope. This suggestion was immediately supported by the Party and League organizations. At this time, Chairman Mao issued a call for a national patriotic health campaign, and people were extremely happy. Dozens of shock teams were immediately established to carry out environmental sanitation. The momentum was like a war. Men, women, old, and young had their own teams and their own tasks. The elderly rummaged through boxes and cabinets at home, washing pots and wiping dishes; the young and strong carried hoes and baskets, digging ditches and filling pits. Soon, the whole slope took on a new look, and at the end of the year, it was named a national model health unit. With this, everyone's enthusiasm was even greater. There was a small assault every three days and a big assault every five days. It never stopped. In February 1957, it became a "four noes" area.

	Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, Wangjiapo's health work has entered a new stage of thoroughly improving environmental sanitation. The Party and the government proposed to turn bamboo sheds into tile houses. The district and city sent technical personnel to help plan and design, and allocated a sum of money. The residents of Wangjiapo were even more energetic. They organized a construction team themselves, prepared materials everywhere, and worked day and night. With the help of the government, they completed the reconstruction plan of Wangjiapo ahead of schedule.

	Not long after the residents moved into the new building, the residents of Group 9 of Section 6 took the lead in beautifying the environment. Every household had a small garden at the door and flower pots on the window sills. The next day, the whole slope held an on-site meeting in Group 9. Within a few days, every household learned to do it. Later, the whole slope further carried out large-scale afforestation. Every household was mobilized, and everyone took action. After more than a year of efforts, trees were everywhere and flowers were in full bloom.

	When we said goodbye to Director Tang and walked out of Wangjiapo, the beautiful banks of the Yangtze River were already brightly lit. However, our hearts were unable to calm down for a long time. We thought that if we want to specifically understand the great role of the patriotic health movement in changing customs and transforming the world, isn't Wangjiapo a typical example that can best explain the problem!

    从此地狱变天堂
    ——全国卫生模范红旗单位王家坡见闻
    本报记者　李祥涛
    站在山城重庆的两杨公路上向下俯视，全国著名的卫生模范地区——王家坡，就像长江边上一座瑰丽的花园。六百多万株树连成一片翠绿茂密的丛林。树丛中露出幢幢新建起来的楼房。在红楼绿树中间，散布着一百多座花园，不时飘来阵阵花香。
    在王家坡的居民宿舍区，每一户的玻璃窗都擦得明晃晃的，窗上挂着各色的窗帘，窗台上摆着瓶花，住在楼下的，门前还砌有各种形式的小花坛，栽着美人蕉、月月红等各种花草。室内各种家具杂物陈设得井井有条，有的家庭还在粉墙上贴着字画。
    在居民宿舍区，我们访问了老婆婆郑永全的家庭。老婆婆郑永全，是王家坡的老住户，解放前她生了十个孩子，却先后被病魔夺去了九个。现在，当我们和她谈起今天的王家坡的环境卫生时，她不禁感慨万端地谈起了过去的情景。从这位老住户的谈话里，旧日的王家坡那幅魔窟般的惨景，不愉快地出现在我们面前：
    解放前的王家坡是个以穷、脏、臭、烂闻名重庆全城的贫民窟。东边是专门积垢纳污的垃圾山，西边是一片荒坟垒垒的棺山坡。区内有三十多条臭水沟到处乱流。处处臭气熏天，行人无不掩鼻。那时穷困的人们就在坟堆、垃圾堆和污水沟间，搭起“地笆笼”房子，挣扎过活。冬天，西北风穿墙而过，夏天，大尾巴蛆直往床上爬。痢疾、霍乱等各种传染病经常缠着王家坡。传染病最严重的1949年夏天，王家坡的居民中，患病的达60％以上，有五百多人被瘟神夺去了生命。曾经有首民歌，生动地描绘了王家坡当时的景象：穷脏臭烂王家坡，尸骨遍地屎尿多，垃圾成山污水河，臭气难当掩鼻过，牛魔神蛇样样有，黑暗恐怖棺山坡，如遇瘟神来降临，十人九口见阎罗。
    现在这一切都一去不复返了。居民们热情歌颂今天的王家坡说：东方升起红太阳，王家坡上放光芒，劳动人民把身翻，从此地狱变天堂。
    郑永全和王家坡公社的文教主任魏云志同志陪着我们参观了红旗街。街道是三合土路面，两旁栽着白杨，十步一个痰盂，二十多步一个垃圾箱。最引人注意的是人们那种良好的爱清洁、讲卫生的习惯。虽然这里已经很少见到苍蝇，路上仍见人人手执蝇拍。我们正走着，忽见一个行人吐痰时不注意吐在盂外了，立刻有个红领巾跑来用纸把痰擦净，并且有礼貌的提出了意见。这时，郑婆婆触景生情的说：“现在的娃娃比大人还讲卫生。我附近的一个小孩赵支平，有天中午，一家人正围着吃午饭，他拉着爷爷的衣袖不让挟菜，大人问他，他说，爷爷为啥不用公筷呢？”
    我们走进左边的商店区，只见整整齐齐的一排铺面，清一色的红墙绿柜台，这里有新华书店、百货门市部、图书室……。在一间挂有“红室”木牌子的房子里，一大群人正在静静地看书读报，墙上贴满了诗歌和图画。魏主任说：“人们的休息方式也变了。过去，一有空就酗酒、赌博、吵架，现在，一有空就读书、看报、写文章，居民们还组织了业余文工团，经常排节目演剧哩！”
    红旗街后面是公社医院，里面病人很少，我们在办公室内碰到了主任医师，他详细地介绍了这里的卫生保健情况：王家坡解放前不但没有过医院，连卖药的郎中也没有。现在，这里建起了医疗预防网，社有医院，所有保健站（室），平均五个居民中就有一个能治小伤小病的保健员，此外还有简易产院、婴儿院、康乐园，专门照顾孕妇、小孩、老人和病人。这个居民区去年就消灭了霍乱、痢疾等一些主要传染病，居民中发病率已由解放初期的60％下降到0．1％—0．2％，而且人人都懂得了一般的卫生知识。
    我们参观了附近的一个保健站，站内药品很齐全，保健员王育芬原来是家庭妇女，过去有了病就求菩萨，现在她当了保健员，已经具备了一般医院护士的卫生知识水平。她笑着对我们说：“现在居民的健康状况越来越好，已经一两个月没有害重病的了。”我们翻了翻登记卡，上面详细记载着每个居民过去和现在的健康状况，王育芬说：“有了这个，就能有计划的进行预防和治疗，过去，生老病死，命全在天，现在，命运由我们自己掌握了。”
    从保健站出来，我们在党委办公室碰到了过去担任过街道主任的唐廷贞，她给我们详细介绍了王家坡改造的经过：经过民主改革运动，人们斗倒了恶霸、把头，心里舒畅极了。这时就有人议论要把全坡打整打整。这意见立刻得到党团组织的支持。这时毛主席发出全国大搞爱国卫生运动的号召，人们高兴极了，立时成立起几十个突击队，大搞环境卫生。那阵势简直像打仗一样，男的、女的、老的、少的，各有各的队伍，各有各的任务。年老的在家翻箱倒柜，洗锅抹盏；年壮的扛锄挑筐，掏沟填坑。很快就使全坡面貌一新，年底被评为全国卫生模范单位，这末一来，大家的劲头更大啦，三天一小突击，五天一大突击，一直没间断过，1957年2月成了“四无”地区。
    1958年大跃进以来，王家坡的卫生工作又进入彻底改善环境卫生的新阶段，党和政府提出要把竹篷变成瓦房。区里、市里都派了技术人员来帮着筹划、设计，又拨来一笔款。王家坡的居民更是干劲冲天，他们自己动手，组织了修建队，四处筹备材料，白天黑夜的干，在政府的帮助下，提前完成了王家坡的改建计划。
    居民们搬进新楼不久，第六段九组的居民首先动手美化环境，家家门口有小花园，窗台上有花盆。第二天全坡就在九组开了现场会，几天功夫，家家都学着干起来了。后来全坡又进一步大搞绿化，家家动员，人人动手，经过一年多的努力，就已处处绿树成荫，鲜花盛开。
    当我们告别了唐主任，走出了王家坡，秀丽的长江两岸，已经灯火齐明了。可是，我们的心却是久久不能平静，我们想，如果要具体的理解爱国卫生运动在怎样的起着移风易俗、改造世界的伟大作用，王家坡不就是一个最能说明问题的典型吗！
