Xinhua News Agency, June 2nd: The memorial speech delivered by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China at the public memorial service held by people from all walks of life in the capital for Comrade Lin Boqu. The full text is as follows:

Comrade Lin Boqu, the great revolutionary fighter and outstanding political activist of the Chinese people, unfortunately passed away on May 29, 1960. Our entire Party and the people of the whole country feel deep sorrow.

Comrade Lin Boqu joined the Communist Party of China in 1921. At the enlarged Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1938, he was elected as a member of the Central Committee. At the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 1945 and the Eighth National Congress in 1956, he was re-elected as a member of the Central Committee and elected as a member of the Central Political Bureau. In 1949, he was elected Secretary-General of the Central People's Government. In the First National People's Congress in 1954 and the Second National People's Congress in 1959, he was elected Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

Comrade Lin Boqu devoted himself to the great revolutionary cause of the Chinese people from his youth. His life was the fighting life of a professional revolutionary. He experienced three historical stages: the old democratic revolution led by the bourgeoisie, the new democratic revolution led by the proletariat, and the socialist revolution. In each historical stage of the revolution, he was a thorough revolutionary, making indelible contributions to the cause of the liberation of the Chinese people.

Comrade Lin Boqu participated in the Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution led by Sun Yat-sen in his early years. After the October Revolution in Russia, he found the correct path for the complete liberation of the Chinese people and joined the Communist Party of China. In 1923, Sun Yat-sen accepted the proposal of the Communist Party of China and decided to implement the three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to workers and peasants. Comrade Lin Boqu actively assisted Sun Yat-sen in reorganizing the Kuomintang and participated in the leadership work of the Kuomintang Central Committee. During the First Revolutionary Civil War, he presided over political work in the Sixth Army of the National Revolutionary Army and established political leadership centered on Communist Party members, which enabled the Northern Expedition to achieve rapid victory. After Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution, he steadfastly participated in the Nanchang Uprising on August 1, 1927. At the critical juncture of the revolution, Comrade Lin Boqu resolutely stood on the side of the revolution, demonstrating the heroic spirit of the proletariat and his infinite loyalty to the cause of people's liberation.

After the failure of the Great Revolution in 1927, Comrade Lin Boqu went to the Soviet Union to study. He returned to China in 1932 and entered the Jiangxi Revolutionary Base Area, serving as the Minister of National Economy and Minister of Finance of the Central Government of Workers and Peasants' Democracy, firmly implementing Comrade Mao Zedong's correct line. Since then, whether during the Long March, during the War of Resistance Against Japan when he served as Chairman of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government, in the united front work he held for a long time, or during the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction, Comrade Lin Boqu consistently stood on the side of the correct line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong, waged irreconcilable struggles against right-leaning opportunism and "left"-leaning opportunism, resolutely safeguarding the interests of the Party and consolidating the unity of the Party, demonstrating the high principle of a Communist Party member.

Comrade Lin Boqu always believed in the great strength of the people and had infinite confidence in the victory of the revolution and a high degree of revolutionary optimism. In the Jiangxi Revolutionary Base Area, during the 25,000-li Long March, throughout the War of Resistance Against Japan, and in the most difficult years of the struggle to smash Hu Zongnan's attack on the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, he always shared the destiny of the people, breathed the same air, worked hard, advanced bravely, feared no difficulties, and disregarded personal safety, demonstrating the noble qualities of a proletarian fighter.

Comrade Lin Boqu was one of Comrade Mao Zedong's closest comrades-in-arms. His life was wholeheartedly devoted to the cause of people's liberation and the cause of communism. Comrade Lin Boqu's great revolutionary fighting spirit, his firm stance in safeguarding the correct line of the Party, and his style of closely linking with the masses and working hard and living plainly are forever worthy of learning by the entire Party and the people of the whole country. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China calls on all Party members and the people of the whole country to inherit Comrade Lin Boqu's lofty revolutionary spirit, unite as one under the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, to strive to build our country into a powerful socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, modern science, and modern culture.

Rest in peace, Comrade Lin Boqu!

    邓小平同志代表中共中央在公祭会上的悼词
    新华社2日讯　中共中央总书记邓小平代表中国共产党中央委员会在首都各界人民公祭林伯渠同志大会上的悼词。全文如下：
    中国人民的伟大革命战士和杰出的政治活动家林伯渠同志，不幸于1960年5月29日逝世。我们全党和全国人民都感到深切的悲痛。
    林伯渠同志于1921年加入中国共产党。在1938年中国共产党扩大的第六届中央委员会第六次全体会议上，被选为中央委员会委员。在1945年中国共产党第七届全国代表大会和1956年第八届全国代表大会上，都继续被选为中央委员，并当选为中央政治局委员。1949年，被选为中央人民政府秘书长。在1954年第一届全国人民代表大会和1959年第二届全国人民代表大会上，都当选为全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长。
    林伯渠同志，从青年时代就献身于中国人民的伟大革命事业。他的一生，是职业革命家战斗的一生。他经历了资产阶级领导的旧民主主义革命、无产阶级领导的新民主主义革命和社会主义革命三个历史阶段。在每个革命的历史阶段，他都是彻底的革命派，为中国人民的解放事业作出了不可磨灭的贡献。
    林伯渠同志，早年曾经参加孙中山领导的中国资产阶级民主革命。俄国十月革命以后，他找到了中国人民获得彻底解放的正确道路，加入了中国共产党。1923年，孙中山接受中国共产党的建议，决定实行联俄、联共、扶助工农的三大政策，林伯渠同志积极地协助孙中山改组国民党并且参加了国民党中央的领导工作。在第一次国内革命战争时期，他在国民革命军第六军中主持政治工作，建立了以共产党员为中心的政治领导，使北伐战争迅速获得胜利。在蒋介石叛变革命后，他坚定不移地参加了1927年8月1日的南昌起义。林伯渠同志在革命的紧要关头，坚决地站在革命的方面，表现了无产阶级的英雄气概和对人民解放事业的无限忠诚。
    1927年大革命失败以后，林伯渠同志赴苏联学习。1932年回国，进入江西革命根据地，担任了工农民主中央政府国民经济部部长、财政部部长，坚定地执行了毛泽东同志的正确路线。此后，无论在长征中，在抗日战争时期担任陕甘宁边区政府主席的工作中，在长期担任的统一战线工作中，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期中，林伯渠同志都是一贯站在以毛泽东同志为代表的正确路线方面，向右倾机会主义和“左”倾机会主义进行了不调和的斗争，坚决维护党的利益，巩固党的团结，表现了共产党员的高度的原则性。
    林伯渠同志，从来相信人民群众的伟大力量，对于革命胜利具有无限的信心和高度的革命乐观主义。他在江西革命根据地，在二万五千里长征、整个抗日战争时期和粉碎胡宗南进攻陕甘宁边区斗争的那些最艰苦的年月里，他始终与人民群众同命运，共呼吸，艰苦奋斗，勇往直前，不怕任何困难，不计个人安危，表现了无产阶级战士的高贵品质。
    林伯渠同志是毛泽东同志最亲密的战友之一。他的一生，全心全意地从事于人民解放事业和共产主义事业。林伯渠同志的伟大革命斗争精神，维护党的正确路线的坚定立场和密切联系群众、艰苦朴素的作风，永远值得全党和全国人民学习。中国共产党中央委员会号召全体党员和全国人民，继承林伯渠同志崇高的革命精神，在以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的领导下，团结一致，为把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的强大的社会主义国家而奋斗。
    安息吧，林伯渠同志！（附图片）
