    Preparing to Protest US President's Visit with Large Demonstrations and Hanging Black Banners
    Japanese People Determined to Launch a Larger-Scale Anti-American Struggle
    Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch from Tokyo: The Japanese people's movement against US President Eisenhower's visit to Japan is intensifying.
    The Japanese "National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty" decided today that when Eisenhower's press secretary, Hagerty, is scheduled to arrive in Tokyo on June 10th, it will organize one to two thousand workers and students to demonstrate at Tokyo International Airport and along the road from the airport to the US Embassy to express their opposition to the US President's visit to Japan. Hagerty decided to come to Japan in advance to prepare for Eisenhower's visit.
    In addition, Japanese labor unions, women's groups, peace organizations, and other mass organizations have also decided to meet with him at the US Embassy or Hagerty's residence on the day Hagerty arrives in Tokyo to request the cancellation of Eisenhower's trip to Japan.
    The Central Executive Committee of the Japan Socialist Party held a meeting today and decided to submit a "Statement of Reasons for Requesting the Cancellation of Eisenhower's Visit to Japan" to Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama and Chief Cabinet Secretary Etsusaburo Shiina tomorrow.
    The Socialist Party also decided to hold a press conference to express the Socialist Party's views against Eisenhower's visit to Japan to domestic and foreign reporters and to distribute the "Statement of Reasons."
    According to reports, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) decided today to hang black mourning banners throughout Tokyo on the 19th, the day Eisenhower arrives in Japan, and to hold large-scale demonstrations and rallies in various places to protest Eisenhower's visit.
    Sohyo also plans to hold rallies and demonstrations across the country on the 11th, with the participation of people from all walks of life, including workers, farmers, cultural figures, and women. In Tokyo, a large-scale protest demonstration involving 200,000 people will be held. A large-scale strike will be held on the 17th to oppose the Japan-US military alliance treaty and Eisenhower's visit.
    In addition, according to Kyodo News, approximately 50,000 students from twenty-seven universities in Tokyo will hold a demonstration at the airport on the 19th to protest Eisenhower's visit to Japan.
    According to radio reports, the "Anti-Mainstream Faction" of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, the "Like-Minded Parliamentarians Roundtable," also held a meeting on the 6th and unanimously advocated postponing Eisenhower's visit to Japan.
    According to reports, even "New York Times" Tokyo correspondent Trumbull had to admit that Eisenhower's Far East trip has acquired an unwelcome militaristic connotation in the minds of many Japanese who belong neither to the left nor to the neutral group. As for Eisenhower's visits to Japan and South Korea, many Japanese believe that this visit is less of a goodwill visit and more of an inspection tour of US overseas bases.
    Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch from Tokyo: The Japan-China Friendship Association issued a statement firmly opposing US President Eisenhower's activities in Japan.
    The statement, issued on June 2nd, pointed out that the Japanese people's struggle against the ratification of the Japan-US military alliance treaty has received the support of the Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world.
    The statement said that at such a critical time, Eisenhower, the mastermind behind sending spy planes to invade the Soviet Union and the culprit who disrupted the Four-Power Summit, is deliberately coming to Japan to boost the morale of the crumbling Nobusuke Kishi government, which is something the Japanese people cannot ignore.
    The statement said that Eisenhower's visit to Japan is against the wishes of the Japanese people and will undermine friendly relations between Japan and China.
    The statement expressed firm opposition to Eisenhower's visit to Japan and demanded the immediate cancellation of the US President's visit plan.
    Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch from Tokyo: The Tokyo Metropolitan Student Self-Government Association Liaison Council decided on the 6th to launch a series of vigorous demonstrations and strikes to oppose US President Eisenhower's visit to Japan and to force the dissolution of the Japanese Diet.
    They decided: On the 10th of this month, the day US Presidential Press Secretary Hagerty arrives in Japan, to mobilize 10,000 students to hold demonstrations around Tokyo's Haneda Airport, the US Embassy, and dormitories; on the 11th, to hold a protest rally jointly with cultural figures with the participation of 40,000 students, and then participate together in the large-scale demonstration led by the "National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty"; to hold a strike on the 17th when large-scale unified actions are launched nationwide; and on the 19th, the day Eisenhower comes to Japan, to mobilize 50,000 students to hold a protest rally, and plan to sit down on the runway of the airport to demonstrate, preventing Eisenhower from getting off the plane.

    日本人民反美爱国斗争势不可当
    准备以大示威和吊黑幡抗议美国总统访问
    日本人民决定掀起更大规模反美斗争
    新华社7日讯　东京消息：日本人民反对美国总统艾森豪威尔访问日本的运动日益高涨。
    日本“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”今天决定，当艾森豪威尔的新闻秘书哈格蒂预定到达东京的6月10日，将组织一、两万名工人和学生在东京国际机场和从机场到美国大使馆的道路两旁举行示威，向他表示反对美国总统访问日本。哈格蒂是为了替艾森豪威尔的访问进行准备而决定提前到日本的。
    此外，日本工会、妇女、和平和其他群众团体也决定在哈格蒂到达东京的那天到美国大使馆或哈格蒂的住处去见他，要求取消艾森豪威尔的日本之行。
    日本社会党中央执行委员会今天举行会议，决定在明天向日本外务相藤山爱一郎和内阁官房长官椎名悦三郎提出“要求取消艾森豪威尔访问日本的理由书”。
    社会党并且决定要举行记者招待会，向国内外记者表示社会党反对艾森豪威尔访问日本的见解，并且散发“理由书”。
    据报道，日本工会总评议会今天决定要在19日艾森豪威尔到达日本那天，在东京市内各地挂起黑色的吊幡，并在各地举行大规模的示威和集会，抗议艾森豪威尔的访问。
    “总评”还计划11日在全国各地举行由工人、农民、文化界人士、妇女等各界人民参加的大会和示威。在东京，将举行二十万人参加的声势浩大的抗议示威。17日将举行大规模的罢工，反对日美军事同盟条约和艾森豪威尔访问。
    另外，据共同社报道，东京的二十七个大学的共约五万名学生将在19日在飞机场举行抗议艾森豪威尔访问日本的示威。
    据电台报道，日本执政党自由民主党的“反主流派”的反岸组织“志同道合议员恳谈会”6日举行会议，也一致主张艾森豪威尔访日延期。
    据报道，连“纽约时报”驻东京记者特兰布也不得不承认：艾森豪威尔的远东之行，在许多既不属于左派也不属于中立集团的日本人的心目中，具有了不受欢迎的军国主义的意味。至于谈到艾森豪威尔到日本和南朝鲜的访问，许多日本人都认为，这次访问与其说是亲善访问，不如说是到美国的海外基地的视察访问。
    据新华社7日讯　东京消息：日中友好协会发表声明，坚决反对美国总统艾森豪威尔到日本活动。
    这项在6月2日发表的声明指出，日本人民反对批准日美军事同盟条约的斗争受到了中国人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民的支持。
    声明说，在这样重大的时期，派间谍飞机侵犯苏联的元凶、破坏四国首脑会议的凶手艾森豪威尔特意要来日本访问，给摇摆欲坠的岸信介政府打气，这是日本人民不能忽视的事情。
    声明说，艾森豪威尔访问日本是违背日本人民愿望的，这将对日中两国友好关系起破坏作用。
    声明表示坚决反对艾森豪威尔访问日本，并且要求立即取消美国总统访日计划。
    新华社7日讯　东京消息：日本东京都学生自治会联络会议6日决定连续展开强有力的示威和罢课斗争，反对美国总统艾森豪威尔访问日本，并且迫使日本国会解散。
    他们决定：在本月10日美国总统新闻秘书哈格蒂到达日本的当天，动员一万名学生到东京羽田机场、美国大使馆和宿舍周围举行示威游行；11日，联合文化界人士举行有四万名学生参加的抗议大会，然后一同参加由“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”领导的大示威；在17日全国展开大规模的统一行动时举行罢课；19日，艾森豪威尔到日本来的当天，动员五万名学生举行抗议大会，并预定到飞机场的滑行道上就地坐下示威，阻止艾森豪威尔从飞机上下来。
