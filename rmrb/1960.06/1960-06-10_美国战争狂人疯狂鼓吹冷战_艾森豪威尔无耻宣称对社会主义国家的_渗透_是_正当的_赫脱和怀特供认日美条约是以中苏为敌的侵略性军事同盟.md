Xinhua News Agency Comprehensive Report: According to Xinhua News Agency, Eisenhower once again clamored for "infiltration" of socialist countries at a Republican Party banquet held near West Point, New York, on the 4th.

In his speech, Eisenhower slandered the socialist camp as "a closed society" and shamelessly said: "We are trying to infiltrate it, and I think we are justified in doing so."

U.S. Secretary of State Herter also slandered socialist countries as "closed societies" in a speech at the University of Pittsburgh on the 8th, and clamored that "as long as there are closed societies composed of oppressed and unfree people, the central political problem of our time will be difficult to solve."

Herter nonsensically claimed that "one of the great problems of our time is the conflict between the concept of an open society and a closed society," and he reiterated Eisenhower's ambition: "Eventually (the world) must become a global family composed of open societies (should be open to the United States)."

Herter frantically attacked socialist countries with the robber logic of imperialism, saying that "the emphasis on secrecy" is "a danger" to the so-called "global family" of the United States. He attacked the Soviet Union by reversing black and white, saying that "it is this superstitious attitude towards secrecy that hinders" the progress of disarmament negotiations, and that the Soviet Union "is unwilling to accept" inspection arrangements for a supervised disarmament system.

Herter advocated that the United States should "explore all available opportunities" to carry out aggression and infiltration against socialist countries, and he emphasized "the special significance of exchange programs in this regard." He said that the U.S. government "will increasingly emphasize that exchange programs are an indispensable component of (America's) sound foreign policy."

Xinhua News Agency, June 8th: Washington News: Although U.S. Secretary of State Herter tried to conceal the aggressive nature of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" while testifying in Congress on the 7th, he inadvertently proved that this treaty is an aggressive military alliance against China and the Soviet Union that U.S. imperialism has been planning for a long time since the war.

In response to Fulbright's questioning before the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Herter openly stated that the "Far East region" referred to in the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" includes China and the Soviet Union. Herter's statement not only proved that the new treaty is hostile to China and the Soviet Union, but also exposed the deception of the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government on this issue.

In narrating and explaining the terms of the new treaty, Herter indicated that the substantive content of the new treaty is consistent with the military alliance treaties concluded by the United States and other vassal states and the treaties of the North Atlantic Aggression Group.

Herter admitted that Article 3, which stipulates that the two countries should "continuously" develop "the ability to resist armed attacks," "embodies" the infamous "Vandenberg Resolution," and "this resolution is also included in other Pacific treaties." As everyone knows, the so-called "Vandenberg Resolution" is a law passed by the U.S. Senate stipulating that the United States should promote its vassal states to accelerate arms expansion and establish aggressive blocs.

Herter also said that the new treaty stipulates that the U.S. military can "use Japanese facilities and areas" to carry out aggressive activities throughout the "Far East."

As for the issue of U.S. troops stationed in Japan using Japanese bases to engage in combat operations and significant changes in the equipment of U.S. troops stationed in Japan, he stated that the United States only "agrees to consult with Japan in advance" "under certain circumstances." However, when asked by a member of Congress whether the United States would agree to all of Japan's demands, Herter refused to discuss this issue further in a public meeting.

Herter also stated that the United States will continue to occupy Okinawa. He said that this island "continues to be controlled administratively by the United States." He also revealed that Japan has expressed its willingness to send troops to this strategic island in the Pacific. That is to say, through this treaty, the United States can use Okinawa as a base to link Japan with the Chiang Kai-shek Group, the Philippines, and South Korea. This is because the military treaties that the United States has concluded with these vassals all include Okinawa within the treaty area.

Herter admitted that concluding this military alliance treaty with Japan is a goal that the United States has been "persistently pursuing" throughout the postwar period.

Xinhua News Agency, June 9th: Washington News: Following Secretary of State Herter, U.S. State Department spokesman White reiterated on the 8th that the aggressive region of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty includes the Soviet Union, and that U.S. troops stationed in Japan can be dispatched to any region to carry out aggression.

White commented on the testimony of U.S. Secretary of State Herter before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the 7th. When he talked about the scope of the "Far East" region referred to in the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," he said that Fulbright had asked Herter: Does the Far East include the Soviet Union? Secretary of State Herter affirmed that it was included.

In order to conceal the aggressive nature of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty against China and the Soviet Union, the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government issued a deceptive "unified interpretation" on February 8th, saying: "The so-called Far East refers to the area around Japan north of the Philippines, and the (Soviet) Primorsky Krai and the Chinese coast are not included in the Far East."

However, White's statement on the 8th once again exposed the Kishi Nobusuke's deception and proved that the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is an aggressive alliance against the Soviet Union and China.

White also said that the U.S. government agreed with Kishi Nobusuke's statement that if the Far East region "is subjected to armed attack, or the security of this region is threatened by the development of the situation in the surrounding areas," the "scope of actions that the United States may take" will "not necessarily be limited to that specific region." That is to say, according to the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," U.S. troops stationed in Japan can be dispatched to any place outside the Far East to carry out aggressive activities under the pretext of any fabricated name by the United States.

    坚决揭穿帝国主义的侵略好战本性

    艾森豪威尔无耻宣称对社会主义国家的“渗透”是“正当的”
    赫脱和怀特供认日美条约是以中苏为敌的侵略性军事同盟
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：艾森豪威尔4日在纽约州西点附近举行的一次共和党宴会上再一次叫嚷要对社会主义国家进行“渗透”。
    艾森豪威尔在讲话中诬蔑社会主义阵营是“一个封闭的社会”，并且无耻地说：“我们尝试渗透它，我认为我们是做得正当的”。
    美国国务卿赫脱8日在匹兹堡大学发表演讲时也污蔑社会主义国家为“封闭的社会”，并且叫嚷说，“只要还存在被压迫和不自由的人民组成的封闭的社会，我们时代的中心的政治问题就很难解决。”
    赫脱胡说什么“我们时代的巨大问题之一，就是开放的社会和封闭的社会的概念的冲突问题”，他重申艾森豪威尔的野心：“最后必须（使世界）成为一个由开放的（应为向美国开放的）社会组成的世界大家庭”。
    赫脱疯狂地本着帝国主义的强盗逻辑，攻击社会主义国家“崇尚保密”对美国的所谓的“世界大家庭”是“一个危险”。他颠倒黑白地攻击苏联说，“也就是这种迷信保密的态度阻挠了”裁军谈判的进展，苏联“不愿意接受”有监督的裁军制度的视察安排。
    赫脱鼓吹美国要“探索一切可以取得的机会”来对社会主义国家进行侵略和渗入，他强调“交流计划在这方面的特殊意义”。他说，美国政府“将要越来越强调交流计划是（美国）健全的外交政策的不可或缺的组成部分之一”。
    据新华社8日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿赫脱7日在国会作证时虽然力图掩饰新日美“安全条约”的侵略本质，但是他却欲盖弥彰地证明：这个条约是美帝国主义在战后策划已久的、以中苏为敌的侵略性军事同盟。
    赫脱在美国参议院外交委员会上答复富布赖特的质询时公然说：新日美“安全条约”所指的“远东地区”包括中国和苏联。赫脱的这个发言不仅证明了新条约是以中苏为敌的，而且揭穿了日本岸信介政府在这个问题上的骗局。
    赫脱在叙述和解释新条约的条款时表明，新条约的实质性的条款内容都是同美国和其他仆从国家缔结的军事同盟条约和北大西洋侵略集团的条约一致的。
    赫脱承认：规定两国要“不断地”发展“抵御武装进攻能力”的第三条“体现了”臭名远扬的“范登堡决议的原则”，并且“这个决议也包含在其他太平洋条约中”。大家知道，所谓“范登堡决议”是美国参议院通过的一项规定美国要促使仆从国加速扩充军备和建立侵略集团的法律。
    赫脱还说，新条约规定美军可以“使用日本的设备和地区”。在整个“远东”进行侵略活动。
    至于驻日美军利用日本基地出动作战和驻日美军的装备有重大改变的问题，他表示美国只“同意在某种情况下”才同日本“事先协商”。但是当议员问到美国是否会同意日本的一切要求时，赫脱拒绝在公开的会议上进一步谈这个问题。
    赫脱还表示美国要继续霸占冲绳岛。他说，这个岛屿“在行政上继续由美国控制”。他并且透露，日本表示它能够派兵到这个太平洋的战略岛屿上去。这就是说，美国通过这个条约，可以以冲绳为据点，把日本和蒋介石集团、菲律宾、南朝鲜联结在一起。因为美国同这些仆从们缔结的军事条约都把冲绳包括在条约地区以内。
    赫脱承认：同日本缔结这个军事同盟条约是美国在战后整个时期“一直在坚持不懈地追求”的目标。
    新华社9日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院新闻官怀特8日继国务卿赫脱之后，重申美日军事同盟条约的侵略地区包括苏联在内，并且驻日美军可以出动到任何地区进行侵略。
    怀特就美国国务卿赫脱7日在参议院外交委员会上的证词发表了评论。他谈到新日美“安全条约”所指的“远东”地区的范围时说，富布赖特曾经问赫脱：远东是否包括苏联。赫脱国务卿肯定，它是包括在内的。
    为了掩饰日美军事同盟条约的以中苏为敌的侵略本质，日本岸信介政府曾经在2月8日发表骗人的“统一解释”，说：“所谓远东，是指菲律宾以北的日本周围地区，（苏联）滨海地区和中国沿岸不包括在远东里面”。
    但怀特8日的发言再次暴露了岸信介这个骗局，证明了新日美“安全条约”是针对苏联和中国的侵略同盟。
    怀特还说美国政府同意岸信介的如下的声明：如果远东地区“遭到武装攻击，或者这个地区的安全因周围地区的局势发展而受到威胁”，美国对此“可能采取的行动范围”将“不一定限于那个具体的地区”。这就是说，根据新日美“安全条约”，驻日美军可以假借美国任意制造的名义，派遣到远东以外的任何地方进行侵略活动。
