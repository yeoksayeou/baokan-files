Improve Urban Short-Distance Transportation Capacity and Reduce the Physical Labor of Transportation Workers
Shenyang Transforms Tricycles into Battery-Powered Vehicles

    (Our newspaper's Shenyang dispatch, June 6th) Battery-powered vehicles driven by DC motors are increasingly appearing on the streets of Shenyang. The original rickshaw and tricycle workers are now sitting comfortably and happily on the driver's seats of these new types of vehicles, transporting goods in a continuous stream. These new vehicles, which are fast and can carry large loads, are rapidly replacing manual handcarts and tricycles, becoming an important tool for short-distance transportation within the city.

    Following the vigorous implementation of mechanization of loading and unloading tools, the Shenyang Municipal Transportation Department has launched a mass movement to transform manual vehicles into battery-powered vehicles, striving to greatly improve the city's short-distance transportation capacity in the short term, and further liberate transportation workers from heavy physical labor. At present, the city has already modified and manufactured more than 1,000 various battery-powered vehicles. To cooperate with the large-scale use of battery-powered vehicles, the city has also established twenty charging stations to undertake the task of charging the battery-powered vehicles.

    The battery-powered tricycles in Shenyang are simple in structure. They simply have three or four storage batteries, a small DC motor, and a set of transmission devices installed on the original manual tricycles. When the power of the storage battery is used up, it can be charged during the time when industrial electricity consumption is the lowest at night, without the need to add additional power sources. Because this type of vehicle directly uses the power of the storage battery to drive, it has no exhaust gas and no noise, making it very suitable for use in cities.

    The emergence and promotion of battery-powered tricycles has opened up a new and important way to solve the current weakness in transportation – the shortage of short-distance transportation capacity. According to preliminary estimates by the Shenyang Municipal Transportation Department, the current battery-powered vehicles in Shenyang have a speed of 12 to 20 kilometers per hour and a carrying capacity of 500 to 2,500 kilograms. Calculated at the lowest efficiency, if only the 9,800 manual vehicles in the professional transportation sector are converted into battery-powered vehicles, the annual transportation capacity will increase by more than 85% compared to the original.

    Transforming manual handcarts and tricycles into battery-powered vehicles has liberated the vast number of transportation workers from heavy physical labor. They drive the battery-powered vehicles briskly back and forth, like car drivers and motorcycle riders. Many of the original rickshaw workers praised the benefits of battery-powered vehicles, saying: "Now we complete the task in a day as if we are playing. We go home in the evening feeling relaxed and happy, have more energy to study culture, and have more time to watch operas."

    After liberation, the Shenyang Municipal Professional Transportation Department added many transportation vehicles, but by the end of last year, manual handcarts and tricycles still undertook 43% of the short-distance transportation tasks; in terms of the number of people, handcart and tricycle workers accounted for 56% of the total number of transportation workers, and if horse-drawn carriage transportation workers are included, the proportion reached more than 96%. At the end of last year, Xifeng and Kaiyuan counties in Shenyang and several auto repair and parts factories in the city successively trial-produced battery-powered vehicles using indigenous methods. After the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee discovered this initiative, it gave it a high evaluation and, through on-site meetings and other means, mobilized the masses to quickly launch a major technical reform of short-distance transportation tools to manufacture battery-powered vehicles on a large scale and to electrify and motorize handcarts and tricycles. The Municipal People's Committee also established a manual vehicle transformation office, and each district was headed by the district party secretary or district head to establish a manual vehicle transformation command or leading group to specifically lead this movement. Many factories, schools, and commercial departments also actively invested in this battle and extensively carried out communist collaboration. Heping District unearthed more than 1,200 old storage batteries and hundreds of tons of metal materials in a few days. Dozens of small and medium-sized factories in Shenyang District contracted to manufacture small DC motors for battery-powered vehicles. While ensuring the completion of the national production plan, the Shenyang Storage Battery Factory rushed to produce a large number of storage batteries. The vast number of transportation workers were even more enthusiastic about investing in the installation and manufacturing of battery-powered vehicles. Many workers' family members also brought scissors, files, and hammers to install them together with the workers.

### 提高城市短途运输能力　减轻运输工人体力劳动  沈阳变三轮车为电瓶车

    提高城市短途运输能力　减轻运输工人体力劳动
    沈阳变三轮车为电瓶车
    本报沈阳6日电　沈阳街头最近出现了越来越多的以直流电动机作动力的电瓶车。原来的人力车和三轮车工人轻松愉快地坐在这种新型车辆的驾驶台上，川流不息地运送着货物。这种速度快、运量多的新车辆，正在迅速代替着人力手推车和三轮车，成为市内短途运输的一种重要工具。
    沈阳市交通运输部门继大搞装卸工具机械化之后，掀起了这一变人力车为电瓶车的群众运动，力争短期内把市内短途运输能力大大提高，使运输工人进一步从笨重的体力劳动中解放出来。现在，全市已经改装制造出的各种电瓶车达一千多辆。配合电瓶车的大量使用，全市还建立了二十座充电站，担负起为电瓶车充电的任务。
    沈阳市的电瓶三轮车结构简单，只是在原来的人力三轮车上安装了三、四个储电池，一个小型直流电动机和一套传动装置。当储电池的电用完以后，可以在夜间工业用电最少的时间里充电，不需要另增加电源，这种车辆由于直接利用储电池的电力推动行驶，既无废气，又无噪音，很适合在城市使用。
    电瓶三轮车的出现和推广，为解决当前交通运输的一个薄弱环节——短途运输能力不足的问题开辟了新的重要途径。据沈阳市交通部门初步测定，目前沈阳的电瓶车，每小时速度达十二公里到二十公里，运载重量达五百公斤到二千五百公斤。按最低效率计算，仅专业运输部门的九千八百辆人力车改装成电瓶车，每年的运输能力就将比原来提高85％以上。
    把人力手推车和三轮车变成电瓶车，使广大运输工人从笨重的体力劳动中解放了出来。他们轻快地驾驶着电瓶车往来奔驰，像汽车司机、摩托车驾驶员一样。许多原来的人力车工人称赞电瓶车的好处说：“现在一天像玩似的就把任务完成了，晚上到家轻松愉快，学文化更有精神，看戏也更有时间了。”
    解放后，沈阳市专业运输部门增加了不少运输汽车，但是到去年年底，人力的手推车和三轮车依然担负着43％的短途运输任务；按人数计算，手推车和三轮车工人，占运输工人总数的56％，如果加上马车运输工人，则比重达到96％以上。去年年底，沈阳市西丰、开原等县及市内几个汽车修配厂，先后用土办法试制出了电瓶车。中共沈阳市委发现这一创举以后，给以很高的评价，通过现场会等，发动群众迅速掀起了大造电瓶车，使手推车、三轮车电气化、机动化的短途运输工具技术大改革的热潮。市人民委员会还建立了人力车改造办公室，各个区也由区委书记或区长挂帅成立了人力车改造指挥部或领导小组，具体领导这一运动。许多工厂、学校、商业部门也积极投入这一战斗，广泛开展了共产主义大协作。和平区在几天之内就挖掘出一千二百多个旧储电池，几百吨金属材料。沈阳区几十个中、小型工厂分工包干，制造电瓶车上的小型直流电动机。沈阳储电池厂在保证完成国家生产计划以外，突击赶制了大批储电池。广大运输工人更是热情洋溢地投入了电瓶车的安装制做工作。很多工人家属也带着剪刀、锉刀、锤子，来和工人一起安装。
