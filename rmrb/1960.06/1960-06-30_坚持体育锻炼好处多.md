    Many Benefits to Persisting in Physical Exercise
    To the Editor:
    Before liberation, I was a child laborer in Yangquan Coal Mine at the age of twelve. The Japanese devils broke my right arm, and the Kuomintang reactionaries bent my spine. Since then, my health has been severely damaged.
    In 1955, under the care of the Party, I was admitted to university, but my weak body made it difficult for me to persist in my studies. At that time, I was extremely anxious. Later, the Party organization encouraged me to participate in physical exercise. In this way, I finally passed the first and second levels of the Labor and Defense System and became a national third-level marathon athlete. With a healthy body, my grades also reached a score of five.

### 坚持体育锻炼好处多

    坚持体育锻炼好处多编辑同志：
    解放前，我十二岁就在阳泉煤矿当童工，日本鬼子打坏了我的右臂，国民党反动派又打弯了我的脊骨，从此，我的健康受到了严重的摧残。
    1955年，在党的关怀下我考上了大学，但病弱的身体使我难以坚持学习。当时，我焦急万分。后来党组织鼓励我参加体育锻炼。就这样，我终于通过了劳卫制一级、二级，成了国家马拉松三级运动员。有了健康的身体，学习成绩也都达到了五分。
