Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou: Leading cadres at all levels of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee went deep into the coal mines to participate in and lead production. This enabled the province's coal industry to quickly overcome the serious threat of storms. The average daily raw coal output in early June increased by 4.5% compared to the same period in May.

During this period, leading cadres at all levels went deep into the mines, leading the masses in flood prevention and drainage. The secretary of the Lianyuan Coal Mine Party Committee led 80% of the mine's cadres to participate in drainage, enabling the flooded mine to quickly resume production. In early June, the average daily coal production of this mine increased by 11% compared to May.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang: Jiangxi Province's coal production has been rising daily since the beginning of June. The daily output level in early June increased by an average of 12% compared to late May. In the five days from June 11th to 15th, production increased again, with the average daily output level soaring another 42% compared to early June.

Since the beginning of June, leading cadres at all levels on the coal front have resolutely improved their leadership style, deeply mobilized the masses, and created a mass movement in all coal mines throughout the province, with everyone striving for coal and high output. Workers in hundreds of small and medium-sized coal mines, which account for a significant proportion of the province's coal production tasks, also displayed soaring enthusiasm, overcame the harm of the rainy season, and achieved substantial increases in production.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan: The Hubei Provincial Party Committee is firmly grasping coal production, and the province's coal production from June 1st to 13th increased by 12% compared to the same period in May.

Li Erzhong, Standing Committee member of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee and Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee Secretariat, and others, successively led cadres to the E'nan Mining Bureau and Tongshan, Puqi, Xianning, and other counties in western Hubei that produce coal to inspect coal production. This prompted the leading cadres in this region to go deep into the mines and work with the workers to solve problems such as mine drainage, equipment installation, and technological transformation, thereby increasing coal production. The output of Puqi Coal Mine in the first five days of June increased by 64% compared to the same period in May, and the tunneling efficiency increased by 75% compared to the same period in May.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei: Since the beginning of June, leading cadres at all levels in Anhui Province's coal industry departments have further penetrated into large and small mining areas, firmly grasped key production areas and weak links, and extensively mobilized workers to carry out production competitions, greatly stimulating the workers' production enthusiasm and promoting increased production in all large and small mines throughout the province. According to statistics, from the 1st to the 15th, the average daily coal output of the province increased by 5.4% compared to the first half of May, with Suixi Coal Mine increasing by 18.6%, Huainan Coal Mine increasing by 6.3%, and the output of small coal mines in Fuyang, Bengbu, Tongling and other places also increasing by 9.5% to 27% respectively.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou: A great overproduction movement has been launched on the coal and coke front in Henan Province. The province's average daily raw coal output level in May increased by 15.5% compared to the first quarter, and in early June it increased by another 1.03% compared to late May. By June 9th, coke production had already exceeded the annual plan by 0.4%, and the output increased by 86.12% compared to the same period last year.

Since the beginning of May, leading cadres of various coal mines have gone deep into the front line of production, focusing on key innovation projects such as eliminating heavy manual labor, simplifying the production process, and saving pit props. One hundred and eighteen pairs of small mines throughout the province have been transformed into small-scale modern mines or semi-modern mines, and coal mining efficiency has generally increased by about one time.

The development of coke production in Henan Province is also very rapid. At present, all two hundred and eight No. 2 simple coke ovens in the province have undergone comprehensive technological transformation, greatly increasing the output and quality of coke.

Xinhua News Agency: Workers on the coal and coke front in Beijing are doing everything possible to increase the production of raw coal and coke to support the increase in pig iron production. In the first half of June, the city's raw coal and coke production completed 58% and 50.6% of the national plan for the entire month, respectively, and the daily output level increased by more than 4% compared to the same period in May.

From the 10th to the 15th, the Jingsi Mining Bureau successively created the highest daily output record since the beginning of this year twice, with the average daily output level increasing by 8.37% compared to the first ten days of the month, and the tunneling footage increasing by an average of 1.99% compared to the first ten days of the month.

Workers at the coking plant of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company launched a vigorous "key problem solving campaign." The time for each coking furnace in the entire plant to refine a furnace of coke was shortened by thirty to eighty minutes compared to the past.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun: Nine key coal mines and mining bureaus in Jilin Province, including Shulan, Taixin, and Jiaohe, overfulfilled the coal production plan for the first half of the month by 14%. The average daily raw coal output of these enterprises in the first half of June increased by 4.5% compared to May.

In order to make June surpass May, the Jilin Provincial Coal Management System successively dispatched more than two thousand cadres, who went deep into the front line, participated in production, and directed production at the same time. All coal mines in the province also implemented a method of promoting advanced experience within a limited time. After Shulan, Jiaohe, and Yingcheng mines implemented the four-eight staggered operation in June, labor efficiency increased by 20% to 35% respectively.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining: By June 10th, workers in Qinghai Province's coal industry had completed 57% of the annual raw coal production plan, an increase of 48% compared to the same period last year. Coke production increased by 69% compared to the same period last year.

Since the beginning of this year, the Qinghai Provincial Bureau of Fuel Industry has adopted various methods such as leading cadres going down to the mines to strengthen leadership on the front line of production, and further launched a competition movement among workers centered on comparing output, labor efficiency, cost, and safety, and promoted new technologies and new experiences that are effective in the coal industry, promoting production. The raw coal output in early June increased by 6% compared to the same period in May, and the average daily output in the first five days of mid-June increased by another 3% compared to the first ten days of the month.
