Xinhua News Agency, 19th. The broad masses of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army land, sea, and air forces angrily condemned the bandit trip of the U.S. warmonger Eisenhower, protested this sworn enemy of the Chinese people defiling our sacred territory of Taiwan, and warmly cheered the Fujian Front's shelling of the "Plague God" as a good thing. They unanimously expressed their firm support for their comrades on the front lines to severely teach Eisenhower a lesson, their determination to liberate the territory of the motherland, Taiwan, and their resolve to fight U.S. imperialism to the end.

    From the two days that Eisenhower, amidst the earth-shattering demonstration of our army's firepower, climbed despondently onto Taiwan and scurried away from Taiwan in disgrace, anti-American fury has spread like wildfire among the heroic officers and soldiers of the three services. The heroic fighters on the coastal defense and border defense lines, after listening to the broadcast of the "Message from the Fujian Front Command to the Military and Civilians of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu," held meetings and demonstrations one after another, denouncing the "Plague God" Eisenhower. They said that Eisenhower personally sabotaged the Four-Power Summit Conference and came to Asia with a body full of gunpowder to plot new wars. Regarding this war monger's bandit trip, the people of the Philippines taught him a lesson with stones, the people of Japan gave his advance guard a beating, and he was given the cold shoulder, forcing him to postpone his "visit." The liberated Chinese people gave him a head-on blow and a post-mortem attack, which was truly gratifying. They said, "American aggressors, hurry up and get out of Taiwan, get out of Japan, get out of Korea, get out of Asia!"

    In Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Shenyang, Wuhan, Lanzhou, Jinan, Kunming, and other places, heroic soldiers have been holding rallies in airports, barracks, on warships, and at various posts for days, denouncing the "Plague God." Soldiers of a certain unit guarding the southeastern coastal defense of the motherland said that Eisenhower, the U.S. imperialist war monger, after personally sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference, came to Asia to spread the germs of war, climbing onto our territory of Taiwan and resolutely making himself an enemy of our people. This once again nakedly exposed his bandit face of false peace and true war preparation. To deal with such a bandit leader, we must thoroughly expose his hypocritical mask and resolutely fight him to the end. Liu Qinggan, an advanced worker of the Nanjing troops, said, "The 'Plague God' Eisenhower is the sworn enemy of the Chinese people. The United States' occupation of our territory of Taiwan, its conspiracy to create 'two Chinas,' and a series of other criminal activities must be punished justly. We will never give up until the American aggressors get out of the Taiwan Strait."

    The broad masses of officers and soldiers warmly supported their comrades on the Fujian Front in angrily shelling and driving away the "Plague God." They said that this shelling was truly satisfying. The anti-American armed demonstration on the Fujian Front was a heroic feat of the great Chinese people's anti-American struggle. Every shell burst forth with the fury of the great Chinese people's anti-American struggle, representing the heroic Chinese people's extreme contempt and scorn for the "Plague God" Eisenhower. In Lanzhou, Tianjin, Harbin, and other places, many soldiers immediately spread the news after hearing the news of the angry shelling to drive away the Plague God. Old Red Army soldier Wu Jiguang said, "The roar of cannons driving away the 'Plague God' Eisenhower expresses our firm will and unwavering determination to oppose American aggression, resolutely liberate Taiwan, and defend world peace. We Chinese people have always scorned and despised American aggressors. As long as the peace-loving people of the world unite, we can certainly defeat imperialist aggression." Ling Jiayin, a Buyi soldier from the Kunming troops, said: "We Buyi people have been fighting jackals since we were little. Jackals are like this, if you don't hit them, they will harm you. We must deal with U.S. imperialism like we deal with jackals! Resolutely fight it to the end!"

    Some former Chinese People's Volunteers heroes who had volunteered to participate in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea expressed their great contempt and scorn for U.S. imperialism with their own victorious war achievements in striking at American aggressors. Hu Zhanfang, former company commander of Yang Liandi's company of the Volunteers, said: "War monger Eisenhower, we warn you, you are our defeated foe. If you dare to launch a war, we will make you suffer head injuries!" Liu Yudi, a former first-class combat hero of the Air Force of the Volunteers, who shot down and damaged eight enemy aircraft on the Korean front, said: "We are now soldiers defending the airspace of the motherland. We must keep our eyes wide open and prepare our aircraft well. If U.S. imperialism dares to touch even a hair of our body, we will definitely cut off its claws!"

    伟大中国人民蔑视鄙视美帝国主义
    一定要把美国侵略者赶出我国台湾
    三军反美怒火炽烈工商、各族人士、宗教和文艺界举行抗议集会
    新华社19日讯　中国人民解放军陆、海、空军各部队广大官兵愤怒谴责美国战争祸首艾森豪威尔的强盗旅行，抗议这个中国人民的死敌沾污我国神圣领土台湾，热烈欢呼福建前线炮轰“瘟神”打得好。他们一致表示坚决支持前线战友狠狠地教训艾森豪威尔，一定要解放祖国领土台湾，坚决与美帝国主义斗争到底。
    从艾森豪威尔在我军震天动地的示威炮火声中黯然爬上台湾和灰溜溜地滚离台湾这两天来，反美怒火在英雄的三军官兵中势如燎原。在海防和边防线上的英雄战士们，收听了“福建前线司令部告台、澎、金、马军民同胞书”的广播，纷纷集会、示威，怒斥“瘟神”艾森豪威尔。他们说，艾森豪威尔亲手破坏了四国首脑会议，又带着一身火药味，到亚洲来策划新战争。对于这个战争头子的强盗旅行，菲律宾人民用石头教训了他，日本人民给了他的先行官一顿杀威棒，又给他吃了一顿闭门羹，迫使他延期“访问”，解放了的中国人民更给了他一顿当头炮和马后轰，真是大快人心。他们说，美国侵略者赶快从台湾滚出去，从日本滚出去，从朝鲜滚出去，从亚洲滚出去！
    北京、上海、广州、南京、沈阳、武汉、兰州、济南、昆明等地英雄战士们连日在机场上、营房里、舰艇上，在各个岗位上举行集会，声讨“瘟神”。守卫祖国东南海防的某部战士们说，艾森豪威尔这个美帝国主义战争头子，一手破坏四国首脑会议之后，又来亚洲散布战争毒菌，爬上我国领土台湾，坚决与我国人民为敌。这又一次赤裸裸地暴露了他的假和平真备战的强盗面目。对付这样的强盗头子，我们一定要彻底扒开他伪善的画皮，坚决和他斗争到底。南京部队先进工作者刘清干说，“瘟神”艾森豪威尔是中国人民的死敌。美国霸占我国领土台湾，阴谋制造“两个中国”等等一系列的罪恶活动，一定要受到正义的惩罚。美国侵略者不滚出台湾海峡，我们决不罢休。
    广大官兵热烈拥护福建前线战友怒炮轰逐“瘟神”。他们说，这一顿炮打得真痛快。福建前线反美武装示威是伟大中国人民反美斗争的英雄壮举。每一发炮弹都迸发着伟大中国人民反美斗争的怒火，都代表着英雄中国人民对“瘟神”艾森豪威尔的极端蔑视和鄙视。兰州、天津、哈尔滨等地许多战士听到怒炮轰逐瘟神的消息，立即奔走相告。老红军吴吉光说，万炮怒吼轰逐“瘟神”艾森豪威尔，表达了我们反对美国侵略、坚决解放台湾、保卫世界和平的坚强意志和不可动摇的决心。我们中国人民从来就是蔑视和鄙视美国侵略者的。只要全世界爱好和平的人民团结起来，就一定可以打败帝国主义的侵略。昆明部队布依族战士岭家银说：“我们布依族人民从小就会打豺狼。豺狼就是这样，你不打它，它就害你。我们对付美帝国主义，就要像对付豺狼一样！坚决和它斗争到底！”
    一些曾经志愿参加过抗美援朝战争的前中国人民志愿军英雄，以自己亲身打击美国侵略者的胜利战绩，对美国帝国主义表示了极大的鄙视和蔑视。前志愿军英雄杨连第连连长胡占芳说：“战争贩子艾森豪威尔，我们警告你，你是我们的手下败将。如果胆敢发动战争，我们就叫你碰得头破血流！”曾在朝鲜前线击落击伤敌机八架的前志愿军空军一级战斗英雄刘玉堤说：“我们现在是保卫祖国领空的战士，我们要把眼睛睁得大大的，把飞机准备得好好的，如果美帝国主义敢于触犯我们一根毫毛，我们一定斩断它的魔爪！”
