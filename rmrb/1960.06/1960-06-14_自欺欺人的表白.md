A Self-Deceiving Confession
By People's Daily Commentator

On the eve of starting his Far East "volcano" trip, U.S. President Eisenhower issued a statement on the 12th. This statement is a deceptive propaganda and a self-exposure. He wanted to conceal the true purpose of his visit to the Far East, but it helped the people of all countries to see more clearly the true purpose of his trip.

Eisenhower obviously realized that the aggressive face of the United States has been further exposed to the world recently. At the same time, he saw the strong opposition of the people of Asian countries, including the people of the countries he will visit, to his visit. Therefore, he felt it necessary to patch up the "peace and amity" cloak that had been torn to pieces before he set off. He attempted another effort to use flowery words to confuse the people of all countries, in order to alleviate some of the strong opposition he would encounter during his Far East trip. However, facts will prove that Eisenhower's efforts are futile.

Eisenhower admitted that he had received "public warnings" that "he shouldn't visit the Far East at this time," but he still decided to "neither postpone nor cancel my visit to the Far East." What is it that makes Eisenhower's trip to the Far East so necessary and urgent? The reason is very simple, because recently the struggle of the people of Asian countries against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs has greatly risen. The United States' puppets everywhere have either been overthrown by the people or are teetering on the brink of collapse. The cornerstones of the United States' policy of aggression in the Far East are becoming increasingly unstable. Therefore, the U.S. President had no choice but to brave the risks and personally come forward to put pressure on the people of these countries and regions, to cheer up and support the U.S. lackeys, and at the same time strengthen the Far East strategic system centered on Japan, and step up the implementation of the U.S. policy of aggression and war in the Far East. Therefore, the people of Japan, the Philippines and other countries regard Eisenhower's visit as an interference by the United States in their internal affairs and a threat to their national democratic movements, which is completely in line with the facts and does not wrong Eisenhower in the slightest.

However, Eisenhower tried his best to conceal this sinister purpose of his trip. In his statement, he insisted that his visit was not primarily "to support a regime or a treaty or a controversial policy," nor "to support a particular plan or to achieve a limited goal." Can this kind of "a guilty person gives himself away" confession deceive anyone? In fact, Eisenhower revealed the true purpose of his visit to the Far East in his own statement.

Eisenhower said that the reason he went to Japan was to "plan and arrange our partnership." It is well known what kind of partnership the reactionary factions of the United States and Japan are currently maintaining, that is, colluding with each other to prepare for aggression in the Far East. The militarist forces in Japan are taking advantage of U.S. assistance to stage a comeback, and the U.S. aggressive group is using the militarist forces in Japan as its aggressive accomplices. They are now trying to formally fix this mutually beneficial and collusive partnership with the U.S.-Japan alliance treaty. Needless to say, if the Japanese people overthrow the rule of the U.S. lackey Nobusuke Kishi group, smash the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, and embark on the road of peace, democracy, independence and neutrality, the "partnership" between the United States and the Japanese reactionaries will inevitably collapse completely. Eisenhower went to Japan precisely to save the Kishi Nobusuke group, save the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, and suppress the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people. Isn't this a clear and obvious thing?

Eisenhower said that the reason he went to South Korea was because maintaining "a bastion" on "the front line of the free world" was essential to the "security" of the United States. Everyone knows that South Korea, this U.S. aggressive "bastion," was shaken from within by the South Korean people not long ago. Although the United States carried out some repairs, this "bastion" is also very unstable. Eisenhower went to South Korea from the perspective of U.S. aggressive interests to contain the South Korean people's impact on the new puppet regime and maintain this "bastion." Isn't this a clear and obvious thing?

Eisenhower said that the reason he went to the Philippines was because the United States and the Philippines "have the closest ties that began sixty years ago," and he was going to "accelerate the realization of helping a developing nation to achieve prosperous independence." In fact, more and more Filipinos have realized that the history of the past sixty years is the history of their being invaded, oppressed, and plundered by the United States, and they have risen up to strive for genuine independence and genuine prosperity. Anti-American sentiment is rising not only among the Filipino people but also among some members of the ruling class. Eisenhower went to try to reverse this situation and continue to implement the major plan of enslaving the Filipino people that the United States "began many years ago." Isn't this a clear and obvious thing?

As for Eisenhower's purpose of going to Taiwan, he himself said it more bluntly, that is, to continue to help the Chiang Kai-shek group, which he praised as "able to maintain a valuable national heritage," and "resist all efforts to destroy this heritage." If we understand the "national heritage" in Eisenhower's mouth as "treacherous acts," then it is very clear that he went to Taiwan to strengthen the policy of antagonizing the Chinese people, continuing to occupy our territory, and preventing the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan.

Can Eisenhower's sinister plots be concealed by beautiful words such as "promoting an atmosphere of international understanding"?

What is particularly nauseating is that Eisenhower talked a lot in his statement about the "friendship" between U.S. imperialism and the people of Asian countries. He said shamelessly that in the countries he will visit, "we have millions of warm and sincere friends, and in every country, this is the vast majority of the people." U.S. imperialism has shown the people of Asia with countless acts of aggression that it is the common enemy of the people of all Asian countries. It is because of the United States' policy of aggression that the Japanese people are being pushed into the abyss of war, the Korean people cannot achieve the reunification of their motherland, the people of Taiwan cannot return to the embrace of their motherland, and the Filipino people are still in a state of oppression. It is because of the United States' policy of aggression that peace and security in Asia and the Far East are seriously threatened. The vast majority of people in Asian countries oppose the United States' policy of aggression and war. Only a small handful of national scum who sell their country for glory and are raised by the United States are willing to act as running dogs who obey the United States' orders. Only they are the United States' "warm and sincere friends." U.S. imperialism is very isolated among the people of Asian countries. Eisenhower cannot hide his panic about this isolation. Are not the tens of millions of Japanese people who participated in the struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty the majority, and is the Kishi Nobusuke group, which is on the verge of collapse under the siege of the people, a small group the majority? Are not the millions of South Korean people who have risen up to oppose the U.S.-backed tyranny the majority, and are not Syngman Rhee and his replacement Heo Jeong, who have helplessly stepped down and secretly fled to the United States, the majority? Are not the 650 million Chinese people and the 9 million compatriots in Taiwan who are devoted to the motherland the majority, and is not a small group of Chiang Kai-shek groups who are willing to be controlled by the United States the majority? If not the vast majority of people in Japan opposed the United States' policy of aggression and war and opposed Eisenhower's visit, why would the Kishi Nobusuke group be so uneasy about the "arrival" of the U.S. "state guest"? Why, according to Kyodo News, would they even consider "using special measures to deal with emergencies 'Police Law', temporarily commanding the police by the Prime Minister; mobilizing U.S. troops stationed in Japan, Self-Defense Forces and fire brigades in the form of welcome" to "escort"? Although Eisenhower used this kind of "self-deceiving" delirium to embolden himself before his departure, he could not help but reveal his uneasiness about the "unpleasant incidents and sporadic disturbances" he was about to encounter.

Eisenhower's statement once again shows that he is the embodiment of the U.S. policy of aggression and war. His trip to the Far East will undoubtedly be a "test trip" regarding U.S. policy. He will see how powerfully the people of Asian countries will show their strong will to oppose U.S. imperialism. Eisenhower's pre-trip lies will certainly not help reduce the "risks" he will encounter on this trip. Let the U.S. President pray to God to bless him along the way.

    自欺欺人的表白
    本报评论员
    美国总统艾森豪威尔在开始他的远东“火山”之行前夕，于12日发表了一项声明。这个声明是一个欺骗宣传，也是一个自我暴露，他想掩盖自己这次访问远东的真正目的，但是却帮助了各国人民更加看清楚他此行的真正目的。
    艾森豪威尔显然是鉴于最近美国的侵略面目已进一步在全世界面前暴露，同时也看到亚洲各国人民，包括他将要访问的国家的人民，对他这次访问所表现的强烈反对情绪，因此认为有必要在动身之前把自己身上那件被扯破得不成样子的“和平和亲善”的外衣作一番补缀。他企图再进行一次用花言巧语来迷惑各国人民的努力，来减轻一点他远东之行将会遇到的强烈反对。虽然，事实将证明，艾森豪威尔的这番努力是徒劳无功的。
    艾森豪威尔承认他受到了“公开的警告”，要他“不应当在目前访问远东”，但是他还是决定了“既不推迟也不取消我对远东的访问”。究竟是什么事情使得艾森豪威尔的远东之行有如此重大的必要性和迫切性呢？其实道理也很简单，就是因为最近以来亚洲各国人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争有了很大的兴起。美国在各处的傀儡不是已经被人民推翻，就是也正在摇摇欲坠。美国在远东推行侵略政策的几个基石
  日益不稳。所以美国总统才不得不甘冒风险、亲自出马，来对这些国家和地方的人民施加压力，给美国的奴仆们打气撑腰，同时加强以日本为中枢的远东战略体系，加紧在远东推行美国的侵略政策和战争政策。因此日本、菲律宾等各国人民把艾森豪威尔的前来访问看作是美国对他们本国内政的干涉，是对他们的民族民主运动的威吓，这是完全符合事实的，是一点也没有冤枉艾森豪威尔的。
    但是艾森豪威尔却竭力想掩藏他此行的这种罪恶目的。他在声明中硬说他的这次访问主要不是“为了支持一个政权或是一个条约或是一个引起争论的政策”，不是“为了支持某一个计划或者实现一个有限的目标”。这种“此地无银三百两”的表白，能骗得了谁呢？事实上，艾森豪威尔在自己的声明中把他访问远东的真正目的揭露出来了。
    艾森豪威尔说，他所以要去日本，是为了“计划和安排我们的伙伴关系”。美国和日本的反动派目前维持着什么样的伙伴关系是人所共知的，那就是互相勾结准备在远东进行侵略。日本的军国主义势力利用美国的帮助东山再起，美国侵略集团利用日本的军国主义势力当它的侵略帮凶。他们现在正在企图用日美同盟条约把这种互相利用和勾结的伙伴关系正式固定下来。不用说，如果日本人民推翻了美国奴才岸信介集团的统治，粉碎了日美军事同盟条约，走上了和平、民主、独立和中立的道路，美国和日本反动派的“伙伴关系”就必然要彻底垮台了。艾森豪威尔到日本去，正是为了挽救岸信介集团，挽救美日军事同盟条约，把日本人民的爱国正义斗争压下去，这不是明明白白的事情吗？
    艾森豪威尔说，他所以要去南朝鲜，是因为在“自由世界的前线”保持“一个堡垒”，对于美国的“安全”是必不可少的。谁都知道，南朝鲜这个美国的侵略“堡垒”不久以前已经被南朝鲜人民从内部动摇了，美国虽然进行了一番修补工作，这个“堡垒”也是很不稳固的。艾森豪威尔正是从美国的侵略利益出发，到南朝鲜去遏止南朝鲜人民对新傀儡政权的冲击，维护这个“堡垒”，这不是明明白白的事情吗？
    艾森豪威尔说，他所以要去菲律宾，是因为美国同菲律宾“有着从六十年以前就开始的最密切的联系”，他是去“加速实现帮助一个正在发展中的民族来取得繁荣的独立”。事实上却是越来越多的菲律宾人民已经认识到过去六十年的历史就是他们受美国侵略、压迫和掠夺的历史，纷纷起来争取真正的独立和真正的繁荣。反美情绪不仅在菲律宾人民当中而且在一部分统治阶级的人士当中也日益高涨。艾森豪威尔前去正是想扭转这样的局面，而继续推行美国“在许多年以前就开始了”的那个奴役菲律宾人民的重大的计划，这不是明明白白的事情吗？
    至于艾森豪威尔要到台湾去的目的，他自己就说得更露骨了，那就是继续帮助他称赞为“能够保持宝贵的民族遗产”的蒋介石集团，“抵抗要毁灭这种遗产的一切努力”。把艾森豪威尔嘴里的“民族遗产”理解为“卖国行径”，那就很清楚，他去台湾是为了加强敌视中国人民、继续霸占我国领土、阻挠中国人民解放台湾的政策。
    艾森豪威尔的这些罪恶图谋，岂是什么“促进国际谅解的气氛”一类漂亮言词所能掩盖得了的吗？
    特别令人作呕的是，艾森豪威尔在他的声明中大谈特谈美帝国主义同亚洲各国人民的“友谊”。他毫不脸红地说什么在他将要访问的国家中，“我们有数以百万计的热诚和真挚的朋友，在每一国中，这都是人民的绝大多数”。美帝国主义已经用无数的侵略行为向亚洲人民表明，它是亚洲各国人民的共同敌人。正是由于美国的侵略政策，日本人民正在被推向战争的深渊，朝鲜人民不能实现祖国的统一，台湾的人民不能回到祖国的怀抱，菲律宾人民至今仍然处在被压迫的地位。正是由于美国的侵略政策，亚洲和远东的和平和安全受到严重的威胁。亚洲各国绝大多数的人民都是反对美国的侵略和战争政策的，只有一小撮卖国求荣的、受美国豢养的民族败类，甘心充当唯美国之命是从的走狗，只有他们是美国的“热诚和真挚的朋友”。美帝国主义在亚洲各国人民当中是十分孤立的。艾森豪威尔想掩藏他对这种孤立的恐慌不安是办不到的。难道几千万参加反对日美军事同盟条约斗争的日本人民不是多数，而在人民围攻之下朝不保夕的岸信介集团一小伙倒是多数吗？难道千百万起来反对美国支持的暴政的南朝鲜人民不是多数，而无可奈何地下台并且偷偷逃往美国去的李承晚和他的替身许政之流倒是多数吗？难道六亿五千万中国人民和心向祖国的九百万台湾同胞不是多数，而甘受美国控制的一小撮蒋介石集团倒是多数吗？如果在日本，不是绝大多数的人民反对美国的侵略战争政策，反对艾森豪威尔前去访问，岸信介集团为什么要为美国“国宾”的“莅临”寝食不安呢？为什么据共同社透露，他们甚至要考虑“利用应付紧急情况的特别措施‘警察法’，暂时由首相指挥警察；以欢迎的形式动员驻日美军、自卫队和消防队”来“护驾”呢？尽管艾森豪威尔在出发之前用这种“自欺欺人”的呓语来替自己壮行色，但是他也禁不住为他将要遇到的“不愉快事件和零星的骚乱”而流露出不安了。
    艾森豪威尔的声明，再一次表明他就是美国侵略和战争政策的化身。他的远东之行无疑的将是一次关于美国政策的“试验性旅行”。他将会看到亚洲各国人民将怎样有力地显示出他们反对美帝国主义的坚强意志。艾森豪威尔行前的一席骗人的鬼话，也肯定无补于减少他此行将要遇到的“风险”。让美国总统去祈求上帝保祐他一路平安吧。
