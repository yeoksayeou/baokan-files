Xinhua News Agency, 6th June: Vice Premier Chen Yi received all members of the Japanese Writers Delegation, headed by Hiroshi Noma, this morning.

During the meeting, Vice Premier Chen Yi held friendly talks with the friends from the Japanese literary world. He paid tribute on behalf of the Chinese Government and the Chinese people to the Japanese people who are standing on the front line of the struggle against U.S. imperialism. He said that the Japanese people are carrying out a magnificent movement against the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, against the Nobusuke Kishi government, and against Nobusuke Kishi's collusion with U.S. imperialism, demanding the realization of Japan's true independence, democracy, and freedom. The progress of this struggle has achieved great victories. The Japanese people have changed the views of the Chinese people and the people of all countries in the world towards Japan through their own actions. The Japanese people are very good people. The tide of the Japanese people's struggle for independence, democracy, and freedom cannot be stopped, and the final victory of the struggle must belong to the Japanese people. The 650 million Chinese people firmly support the just struggle of the Japanese people.

The head of the Japanese Writers Delegation, Hiroshi Noma, expressed his warm gratitude for the Chinese people's support for the Japanese people's just struggle. He said that the Japanese people have stood up. The Japanese people must overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi government and drive U.S. imperialism out of Japanese territory. Katsuiro Kamei said that Japan is currently experiencing a great historical event, the true beginning of Japanese history. He believes that the Japanese people and the Chinese people should form a united front and fight to defend world and Asian peace. He said that the Japanese people must strengthen unity and carry out a long-term and unremitting struggle against imperialism and colonialism until the final victory. Yoko Matsuoka said that the so-called Japan-U.S. Security Treaty was forcibly passed on the evening of May 19th under the protection of the police and gangsters, and the police and gangsters are the essence of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. This treaty is not only intended to cruelly suppress the Japanese people but is also aimed at New China. Therefore, the Japanese people and the Chinese people shoulder a common struggle task. She said that the more the Japanese people put into the struggle, the greater the gains will be, and the Japanese people will persevere in the struggle and attract more and more people to participate in the struggle. Minoru Takeuchi said that the Japanese people must continue to fight, resolutely oppose the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, and achieve true independence, democracy, and freedom. Kenzaburo Ooe said that the Japanese people now have a consistent struggle goal, which is an epoch-making event. Japanese politicians throughout history have never exposed their faces as nakedly as the current politicians. Nobusuke Kishi is a deeply hated person who has done all kinds of bad things, and at the same time, he is a typical "negative teacher." Nobusuke Kishi's tragic end is inevitable. Kenzaburo Oe said that in the struggle against the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, Japanese youth focused their struggle goal on one point, which is to strive for Japan's true independence, and this struggle will surely be victorious.

Present at the meeting were Liao Chengzhi, Shen Yanbing, Chu Tunan, Lao She, Yang Hansheng, Shao Quanlin, Zhou Erfu, Yang Shuo, Yang Zheng, Sun Pinghua, and the Japanese peace advocate in Beijing, Kinkazu Saionji.

    中国人民坚决支持日本人民的正义斗争
    陈毅接见日本文学家代表团并进行友好谈话
    新华社6日讯　陈毅副总理在今天上午接见了以野间宏为首的日本文学家代表团的全体成员。
    在接见的时候，陈毅副总理同日本文学界的朋友们进行了友好的谈话。他代表中国政府和中国人民向站在反对美帝国主义斗争最前线的日本人民致敬。他说，日本人民正在开展波澜壮阔的运动，反对日美安全条约，反对岸信介政府，反对岸信介同美帝国主义勾结，要求实现日本真正的独立、民主和自由，这一斗争的进展，已经取得了伟大的胜利。日本人民以自己的行动，改变了中国人民和世界各国人民对日本的看法。日本人民是很好的人民。日本人民争取独立、要求民主、自由的斗争潮流是阻挡不住的，斗争的最后胜利一定属于日本人民。六亿五千万中国人民坚决支持日本人民的正义斗争。
    日本文学家代表团团长野间宏在谈话中，热烈感谢中国人民对日本人民正义斗争的支持。他说，日本人民已经站起来了。日本人民一定要把岸信介政府打倒，一定要把美帝国主义从日本国土上赶出去。龟井胜一郎说，现在日本正经历着一个伟大的历史事件，是日本历史的真正开始。他认为，日本人民和中国人民应该结成统一战线，为保卫世界和亚洲的和平而斗争。他说，日本人民一定要加强团结，长期地、再接再厉地进行反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争，直到最后胜利为止。松冈洋子说，5月19日晚上所谓日美安全条约是在警察和流氓的保护下强行通过的，警察和流氓就是日美安全条约的实质。这个条约不仅是为了更加残酷的镇压日本人民，而且是针对着新中国的，因此，日本人民和中国人民就担负着共同的斗争任务。她说，日本人民付出的斗争力量越大，斗争的收获也就会越大，日本人民一定会坚持斗争下去，而且会吸收越来越多的人参加到斗争中来。竹内实说，日本人民一定要继续斗争下去，坚决反对日美安全条约，实现真正的独立、民主和自由。开高健说，现在日本人民有了一致的斗争目标，这是一个划时代的事件。日本历代的政治家从来没有像现在的政治家这样赤裸裸地把自己的面目暴露出来，岸信介是一个作尽了坏事值得深恶痛绝的人，同时他又是一个典型的“反面教员”，岸信介的可悲结局是不可避免的。大江健三郎说，在反对日美安全条约的斗争中，日本青年把斗争目标集中在一点上，这就是争取日本真正的独立，这个斗争一定会得到胜利。
    接见时在座的，有廖承志、沈雁冰、楚图南、老舍、阳翰笙、邵荃麟、周而复、杨朔、杨正、孙平化等人，以及在北京的日本和平人士西园寺公一。
