That "Time" Will Never Come
    Su Hai
    Faced with the powerful demonstrations of the Japanese people, the Kishi Nobusuke group was finally forced to announce the postponement of Eisenhower's "visit" to Japan. The Kishi Nobusuke government's statement said: Considering the current situation in Japan, "it is not appropriate to welcome state guest President Eisenhower. Therefore, it has been decided to request Eisenhower to postpone his visit to Japan and to request him to postpone the date of the visit to Japan to an appropriate time when the whole country can welcome him." The Kishi Nobusuke group originally wanted to suppress the fighting anger of the masses through the bloody suppression of "June 15th" to pave the way for the god of plague. However, contrary to their wishes, the bloody suppression aroused even more fervent anti-American and anti-Kishi anger among the people. Kishi Nobusuke government's Minister of Education Matsuda admitted that the ability of the Japanese police was no longer able to "maintain public order." "A clay Bodhisattva crossing the river cannot even save itself." In this situation, how dare they guarantee the safety of their master?
    Of course, the reactionaries will never give up. But even this initial victory fully proves that to stop imperialism from launching wars of aggression, we can only rely on the resolute struggle of the people. This victory gives the heroic Japanese people confidence to advance victoriously and strive for final victory. Japanese student Kuno Kunikiyo said well: "We don't want him to come at any time. If he comes, we will demonstrate." The Japanese people have great hope. The Japanese people will definitely carry out the struggle to the final victory, and Kishi Nobusuke's dream of "national welcome" for Eisenhower will never be realized.

    那个“时候”永远不会来

    在日本人民强大的示威运动面前，岸信介集团终于被迫宣布请艾森豪威尔延期“访问”日本了。岸信介政府的声明说：从日本的现状看来，“对于欢迎国宾艾森豪威尔总统一事是不相宜的，因此，决定要求艾森豪威尔延期访日，并且决定要请求他把访问日本的日期推迟到能够举国欢迎的适当的时候”。岸信介集团原想通过“六·一五”的血腥镇压，把人民群众的斗争怒火压下去，为瘟神开路。然而事与愿违，血腥的镇压反而激起了人民更加炽烈的反美反岸怒火。岸信介政府的松田文相供认，日本警察的能力已经无法“维持治安”。“泥菩萨过江，自身难保”，在这种情况下，又怎敢保证主子的安全？
    当然，反动派是绝对不会就此罢休的。但即便是这个初步的胜利，也充分证明了：要遏止帝国主义发动侵略战争，只有依靠人民群众的坚决斗争。这个胜利，给英勇的日本人民乘胜前进争取最后胜利以信心。日本学生久野邦清说得好：“我们在任何时候都不希望他来，如果他来，我们就示威。”日本人民是很有希望的。日本人民一定会把斗争进行到最后胜利，岸信介“举国欢迎”艾森豪威尔的梦想是永远也无法实现的。
