Xinhua News Agency, Washington, June 24th: Alarmed by the surging anti-American, patriotic, and righteous struggle of the Japanese people, the American authorities are plotting to permanently occupy Okinawa and the Ryukyu Islands, turning them into bases for aggression and suppression against the people of Asian countries.

U.S. Army Civil Affairs Chief Major General Meade revealed this conspiracy yesterday while testifying before the Senate Military Subcommittee. Meade said that the Pentagon plans to "retain indefinitely" the Ryukyu Islands. He expressed unease about the heroic struggle of the Japanese people, saying, "If someone can tell me what Japan will be like in six months, he's a lot better than I am." He then clamored that the Ryukyu Islands are "extremely important" to U.S. "defense" in the Western Pacific.

The United States has air force, naval, and missile bases in Okinawa, and this U.S. outpost occupies an important position in the war schemes planned by the United States. The people of Okinawa, who are constantly engaged in anti-American struggles, recently rose up in demonstrations and drove away the plague god Eisenhower when he "visited" there.

Meade's clamoring at the Military Committee was applauded by some senators. Democratic Senator Thurmond said, "We (the United States) may have to rely on Okinawa and the Ryukyu Islands to protect our forces in the Far East." Republican Senator Case brazenly and shamelessly described Okinawa, Japanese territory, as a "stronghold over which" the United States "has full sovereignty."

### 美国陆军少将米德透露  美国要长期霸占琉球群岛

    美国陆军少将米德透露
    美国要长期霸占琉球群岛
    新华社24日讯　华盛顿消息：在日本人民汹涌澎湃的反美爱国正义斗争面前感到惊慌的美国当局，正在阴谋永久霸占冲绳和琉球群岛，把它们变成侵略和镇压亚洲各国人民的根据地。
    美国陆军部民政处处长米德少将昨天在参议院军事小组委员会上作证时泄露了这个阴谋。米德说，五角大楼计划“无限期地保留”琉球群岛。他对日本人民的英勇斗争表示不安，他说：“如果有人能告诉我日本在六个月后会怎么样，那他就要比我强得多。”他接着叫嚷说，琉球群岛对美国在西太平洋的“防御极关重要”。
    美国在冲绳设有空军、海军和导弹基地，这个美国前哨据点在美国策划的战争阴谋中占有重要的地位。不断进行反美斗争的冲绳人民不久前曾奋起示威，轰跑到那里去“访问”的瘟神艾森豪威尔。
    米德在军事委员会上的叫嚷，得到了一些参议员的喝彩。民主党参议员索孟德说：“我们（美国）可能要靠冲绳和琉球群岛来保护我们在远东的力量。”共和党参议员凯斯公然无耻地把日本的领土冲绳说成是美国“拥有全部主权的据点”。
