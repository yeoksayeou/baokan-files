New Record for Rapid Steelmaking

The challenge selection competition at the No. 3 Steelmaking Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel is in full swing. The area in front of Furnace No. 1 was like a scene of celebration, with everyone concerned about this heat of rapid steelmaking being demonstrated by first assistant Shi Baoqian. Workshop director Wu Jingtao stayed right behind Shi Baoqian, sometimes signaling to raise the furnace door to observe the furnace conditions, and sometimes running to the instrument room to help check the temperature of the regenerator. Section Chief Dan Tingguo was constantly helping to coordinate the raw materials, ingots, and operations on and around the furnace, afraid that anyone would delay him for even a minute.

Sweat dripped like beans from Shi Baoqian's face onto his neck, and his heat-resistant suit and the leather belt tightly tied around his waist were soaked through.

Suddenly, a shout of slag running came from behind the furnace, and with the sound, workers from the ingot casting section came looking for the open-hearth furnace. Shi Baoqian, demonstrating rapid steelmaking for the first time, never expected this, and was stunned for a moment, unsure of what to do. At this tense moment, someone patted Shi Baoqian's shoulder, "Don't panic, stay calm. If this step didn't go well, grab the next one." He turned around and saw Party Branch Secretary Hu Zhongli. A warm current flowed through Shi Baoqian's entire body. He took off his coat and said firmly, "Secretary Hu, I will definitely take down this heat of steel."…

"Furnace No. 1, carbon content one hundred, Furnace No. 1, carbon content one hundred..." The results of the first steel sample analysis from the laboratory came over the loudspeaker. When Shi Baoqian heard this, the carbon was too high, and he immediately directed his comrades to blow air. Small repair workers and ingot casting workers from other open-hearth furnaces came to support, helping to lift the air pipes and carry the steel bars, pushing one red-hot steel bar and iron pipe after another in front of the furnace, measuring the temperature and taking samples again, and then blowing air. After several minutes of busyness, Section Chief Dan Tingguo patted Shi Baoqian's shoulder and said, "Okay, pour the steel immediately." Instantly, a cloud of thick smoke rose, followed by sparks flying in all directions. Three giant streams, like three giant dragons, stretched out, and half of the factory lit up in a red glow, creating the highest record for rapid steelmaking this year. Someone exclaimed in admiration, "What a beautiful heat of steel!"

    快速炼钢的新纪录
    鞍钢第三炼钢厂攻关选拔赛搞得热火朝天。一号炉炉前像出了喜事一样，人们都在关心着一助手石宝千表演的这炉快速炼钢。工长吴静涛一直跟在石宝千的身后，一会儿示意炉门抬起来观察炉况，一会儿跑到仪器室帮助查看蓄热室温度；值班长单廷国一直在原料、铸锭、炉上、炉下帮助联系，恐怕别人耽误他一分钟。
    汗珠像豆粒似的从脸上淌到石宝千的脖子上，防热服和腰间紧扎的牛皮带都湿透了。
    突然，炉后传来了跑渣的呼喊声，随着声音铸锭工段的工人找上平炉来。头一次表演快速炼钢的石宝千怎么也没料到这一着，一时惊得呆了，不知如何是好。正在这个紧张的时刻，有人拍了一下石宝千的肩膀，“别着慌，要冷静，这一步没搞好，抓紧下一步。”回头一看是党支部书记胡忠礼，一股暖流通过了石宝千的全身，他顺手脱去外衣，坚定地说：“胡支书，我一定拿下这炉钢。”…………
    “一号炉炭素一百，一号炉炭素一百……”。广播器里传来化验室化验第一个钢样的结果。石宝千一听，炭高了，马上指挥战友们吹风。其他平炉的小修理工人和铸锭工人都来支援了，帮助抬风管扛钢棒，把一根接着一根被烧红的钢棒和铁管推到炉前，测量温度再取样，然后再吹，一直忙了几分钟，值班长才拍拍石宝千的肩膀说：“好了，马上出钢”。霎时，一团浓烟升起，接着火花四溅，三股巨流如同三条巨龙，延伸开去，半个厂房闪起一片红光，创造了今年以来快速炼钢的最高纪录，不知是谁赞叹地说：“好漂亮的一炉钢！”
