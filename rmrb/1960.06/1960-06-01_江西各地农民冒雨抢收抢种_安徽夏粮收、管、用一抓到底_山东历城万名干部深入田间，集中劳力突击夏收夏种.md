Farmers in Jiangxi brave rain to rush harvest and planting
Anhui grasps summer grain harvesting, management, and usage to the end
Shandong Licheng sends ten thousand cadres deep into the fields, concentrating labor to launch a summer harvest and planting blitz

(Our Dispatch) Farmers in various parts of Jiangxi Province, braving wind and rain, are launching a crash harvest and planting campaign, generally achieving harvesting and planting wherever crops are ripe, and ensuring good harvests and plantings.

More than six million mu of spring-ripening crops in Jiangxi Province have been successively harvested and stored. To date, the area of spring-ripening crops that has been harvested has reached more than five million mu, accounting for over 90% of the area to be harvested. Among them, silkworm cocoons, peas, and rapeseed have been completely harvested, and wheat has been harvested by 90%. 60% of the harvested area has been promptly planted with rice, miscellaneous grains, and cash crops. In many places, the goal of “yellow in the morning, green in the evening, no white fields overnight” has been achieved.

The Yichun Special District of Jiangxi organized more than 700,000 laborers, dividing them into two groups, one to rush the harvest and planting, and the other to focus on field management of early rice. The entire district has harvested more than 1.26 million mu of spring-ripening crops and rapidly brought them in, and all have been planted with various crops. Sanli Commune in Jinxian County even erected thatched sheds in the fields, organizing more than 8,000 laborers to camp on the edge of the fields, cutting and binding on the spot, harvesting in sunny weather, and threshing in rainy weather. To overcome the yin and rain, and to overcome the shortcomings of the red soil's high acidity, many communes opened ditches and created ridges in the wheat stubble land to be planted with sesame, applying about 200 jin of lime per mu. In order to ensure that harvesting and planting do not miss the farming season, Linchuan County organized experienced veteran farmers to conduct a comprehensive inspection and ranking of crop growth before harvesting. When to harvest and what to plant were marked with signs in the fields, making harvest and planting plans. In order to achieve planting immediately after harvesting, fertilizers were delivered to the fields in advance, and field fertilizer cellars were established. Seedlings were also transplanted.

In order to ensure timely harvesting and planting, and to prevent continuous rainy weather from causing spring-ripening crops to fail to achieve a bumper harvest and affecting the planting season, Jiangxi Province made full use of the advantages of the people's communes’ large organizational scale and wide range of activities. According to multiple processes such as harvesting, planting, etc., harvesting, transportation, threshing, drying, plowing, fertilizing, planting and other professional teams and shock combat groups were organized, implementing a "one-stop" assembly line operation of side-by-side harvesting, plowing, and planting, achieving harvesting one plot, planting one plot, harvesting wherever it's ripe, planting wherever it's ripe. Therefore, although the harvest season in various places has been prolonged by the rainy weather, the progress of harvesting and planting is generally ten to fifteen days earlier than in previous years. According to the situation that Shanggao County has heavy production tasks, many projects, and tight labor, each commune, with the production brigade as the unit, organized male laborers and young and middle-aged women into harvesting, transportation, plowing, and planting groups, women who could not work in the fields into threshing and drying groups, elderly commune members into winnowing groups, and commune members who could not engage in physical labor into watching and drying groups, ensuring that there were enough laborers to participate in the rush harvest and planting, and ensuring that summer harvesting, rice transplanting, and management were not neglected.

(Our Dispatch) Anhui Province has formulated a complete set of methods for the harvesting, management, and use of summer grain.

Now, from both sides of the Huai River to the north and south of the Yangtze River, wheat waves are rolling, and gold is spread on the ground, and it is about to enter a full-scale harvest climax.

From the county to the production team, Anhui established specialized organizations to lead the summer harvest at all levels; and generally established various wheat harvesting professional teams such as harvesting, threshing, drying, transportation, and warehousing; and arranged the maturity period of crops, determined the harvesting time, and achieved harvesting as soon as a piece is ripe. The Wuhu Special District recently established more than 21,100 harvesting professional teams, organizing more than 374,000 laborers, which greatly accelerated the harvesting and transporting progress. Because the people's communes in the suburbs of Anqing City organized professional teams and implemented the assembly line operation method, they rushed to harvest and thresh all 8,300 mu of ripe barley and yuan wheat in only seven days. While speeding up the rush harvest, the broad masses of people paid great attention to the quality of the rush harvest.

In terms of the layout of the threshing floor, the people's communes generally built a threshing floor of about 200 mu. Now, more than 132,000 threshing floors have been built in the province. These threshing floors are selected in the center of concentrated and contiguous wheat fields in the sun-facing and dry terrain, and field-concentrated threshing greatly reduces transportation labor and grain round-trip loss.

In managing summer grain well, various places focus on three links: building warehouses, training grain management personnel, and establishing management systems. The communes throughout the province, with the brigade as the unit, uniformly plan grain warehouses, store food grain, seeds, feed, and reserve grain in separate warehouses, and use special grain for special purposes. According to the principle of both easy eating and easy management, the layout of warehouses and the size of the storage capacity are reasonably planned to achieve simplicity and economy. Now, more than 99,000 various warehouses have been built in the province, and cleaning and disinfection have been universally carried out. Strict management systems have been established in the grain warehouses in various places, so that receipts and expenditures are accounted for, and access and exits are documented. It is required that the grain entering the warehouse meets the prescribed quality; after entering the warehouse, the custodians promptly record it in the accounts and report the statistics.

On the basis of good harvesting and management, various places, in line with the principle of "looking forward and backward, prosperity does not forget the deficit, a trickle of water, and leaving room," allocate the living grain indicators of commune members to households by season, and the grain is regularly allocated to the canteen to ensure that they eat enough, eat well, and save.

(Our Dispatch) Wheat in Licheng County, Shandong Province, has generally begun to be harvested. More than 10,000 cadres from the county, communes, and teams gathered in the fields, contracted by districts, and took responsibility from harvest to warehousing, and from planting to full seedlings. All of them participated in the first line of production, launched a blitz to harvest wheat, and achieved harvesting and planting.

This year's summer harvest and planting tasks in Licheng County are particularly heavy, and the labor and tools are unprecedentedly tight. According to the original calculation, the labor force is generally short of 30% to 50%. Only by concentrating more than 90% of the labor force can this contradiction be solved. The Licheng County Party Committee recognized this situation, made a decisive decision, and took several measures such as rushing, stopping, transferring, and replacing to quickly concentrate more than 90% of the labor force for summer harvesting and planting. Rushing is to rush the farm work in the wheat season forward to pave the way for harvesting and planting; stopping is to temporarily stop things that can be stopped. For example, during the wheat harvest period, various departments stopped holding meetings, middle and primary schools stopped classes, and sideline occupations and non-urgent community-run industries stopped production to make way, which alone freed up 70,000 to 80,000 people to participate in the summer harvest; transferring is to temporarily transfer professional teams such as forestry and fishery to harvest wheat, and scientifically adjust the labor force and production plans, distinguishing priorities, primary and secondary, and urgent matters; replacing is to replace the weak with the strong and the old with the strong from departments such as breeding, cooking, sewing, hairdressing, and childcare. In order to ensure the smooth completion of the summer harvest and planting tasks, Licheng County also strengthened ideological mobilization work, such as explaining to the masses the policies on food grain, purchase tasks, seed retention, and explaining the policies on excess production rewards, wage and fertilizer payment in a quarter allocation. In this way, the masses have a clear idea, the direction is clear, and the enthusiasm is greater. (Attached picture)

    江西各地农民冒雨抢收抢种
    安徽夏粮收、管、用一抓到底
    山东历城万名干部深入田间，集中劳力突击夏收夏种
    本报讯　江西各地农民，顶风冒雨，突击抢收抢种，普遍做到熟到那里，收到那里，种到那里，收好种好。
    江西省六百多万亩春熟作物，已陆续登场入库。到目前止，已经收割的春熟作物面积达五百多万亩，占应收面积的90％以上，其中蚕、豌豆、油菜已收割完毕，大小麦已收割90％，60％的收割面积已及时种上了水稻、杂粮和经济作物。有许多地方做到了朝黄夕绿，白田不过夜。
    江西宜春专区组织七十多万劳动力，兵分两路，一路抢收抢种，一路狠抓早稻田间管理，全区已收割一百二十六万多亩春熟作物迅速收获上场，并全部种上了各种作物。进贤县三里公社还在田间搭起了茅棚，组织八千多个劳动力在田边安营扎寨，就地割、就地捆，晴天收割、雨天脱粒。为战胜阴雨，克服红壤酸性大的缺点，许多公社在待种芝麻的麦茬地里开沟造畦，每亩施二百斤左右石灰。临川县为做到边收边种不误农时，还在收割前组织有经验的老农，对作物生长情况全面进行了检查排队，什么时候收，种什么，都在田头插牌立标，作出了收种规划。为做到随收随种，都事先把肥料送到田边，建立田头肥窖，并采取插寄秧的办法。
    江西各地为做到适时收割、适时播种，不因连绵阴雨给春熟作物造成丰产不能丰收，和影响播种季节，全省各地都充分运用了人民公社组织规模大、活动范围广的有利条件，按照收、种等多道工序，组织了收割、搬运、脱粒、翻晒、耕翻、施肥、播种等各种专业队和突击战斗小组，实行边收、边翻、边种“一条龙”的流水作业法，做到了熟一丘、种一丘，熟到那里、种到那里。因而各地收割季节虽久处阴雨，但收种进度一般都比往年提早了十天到半个月。上高县根据生产任务重、项目多、劳力紧张的情况，各公社以大队为单位，把男劳动力、青壮年妇女编成收割、搬运、耕翻、播种组，不能下田的妇女编成脱粒、翻晒组，老年社员编成风扬组，不能从事体力劳动的社员组成看晒组，保证了有足够的劳力参加抢收抢种，做到了夏收、插秧、管理三不误。
    本报讯　安徽省各地制定了夏粮收管用的一整套办法。
    现在，从淮河两岸到大江南北，麦浪翻滚，黄金铺地，即将进入全面收割高潮。
    安徽各地从县到生产队，都层层建立了领导夏收的专门机构；普遍成立了收割、脱粒、整晒、运输、入仓等各种麦收专业队；并按作物成熟期排队，确定收割时间，做到熟一块、收一块。芜湖专区最近成立了各种收打专业队二万一千一百多个，组织劳力三十七万四千多人，大大加快了收打运进度。安庆市郊各人民公社因为组织了专业队，实行流水作业方法，仅七天时间，就将八千三百多亩黄熟的大麦、元麦全部抢收登场。广大群众在加快抢收的同时，非常注意抢收质量。
    在打谷场的布局上，各人民公社一般按二百亩左右建一块打谷场，现在全省已建打谷场十三万二千多块。这些打谷场都选定向阳高燥的地势，设在集中连片的麦田中心，就田集中打场，大大减少了运输劳力和粮食往返损耗。
    各地在管好夏粮工作中，着重抓修建仓库、培训粮食管理人员和建立管理制度等三个环节。全省各公社以大队为单位统一筹划粮食仓库，将口粮、种子、饲料和储备粮，分仓储存，专粮专用。并根据既便于吃用，又便于管理的原则，合理规划了仓库的摆布和库容的大小，达到因陋就简，经济实用。现在全省已建各种仓库九万九千多座，并普遍进行了打扫和消毒工作。各地的粮食仓库都建立了严格的管理制度，做到了收支有账目，出入有凭证，要求入仓的粮食要符合规定质量；入库以后，保管员及时登账，统计上报。
    在收好、管好的基础上，各地本着“瞻前顾后，丰不忘歉，细水长流，留有余地”的原则，将社员的生活用粮指标，分季安排到户，粮食定期拨到食堂，保证吃饱吃好吃省。
    本报讯　山东历城县小麦普遍开镰收割，县、社、队一万多名干部会师到田，分片包干，从收到入仓，从种到全苗，一包到底，边干边指挥。各公社都集中了90％以上的整半劳力，参加生产第一线，突击收麦，做到随收随种。
    历城县今年夏收夏种的任务特别繁重，劳力工具空前紧张。原来计算，劳动力一般缺30％到50％，只有集中90％以上的劳力，才能解决这个矛盾。中共历城县委认清了这一形势，当机立断，采取赶、停、调、换等几个办法，把90％以上的劳力迅速集中起来，用于夏收夏种。赶是把麦季农活向前赶，为收、种开道；停是把可以停办的事情，暂时停下来。如麦收期间各部门停止开会，中、小学校停课，副业和非当务之急的社办工业，停产让路，只此一项，即腾出七、八万人参加夏收；调是把林业、渔业等专业队伍，临时调去收麦，并把劳力、生产规划，科学的加以调整，分出先后主次，轻重缓急；换是从饲养、炊事、缝纫、理发、托儿等部门中，以弱换强，以老换壮。为了保证顺利地完成夏收夏种任务，历城县还加强了思想发动工作，如向群众交代口粮、征购任务、种子留量，以及说明超产奖励、一季分配中工资及肥料价款兑现等政策。这样群众心中有数了，方向明确了，干劲就大。（附图片）
