Xinhua News Agency, June 17th, Manila Dispatch: After a three-day visit to the Philippines, U.S. President Eisenhower boarded the U.S. heavy cruiser "St. Paul" late on the 16th and left Manila for Taiwan to engage in new conspiracy activities.

According to the Associated Press, "he looked very somber" because the fact that he was forced to cancel his visit to Japan due to the fierce protests of the Japanese people "spoiled this trip." Eisenhower's farewell speech was very brief, avoiding any mention of his forced cancellation of his trip to Japan. The Associated Press admitted that one "notable" thing during his last few hours in the Philippines was "receiving a slap in the face from the Japanese people."

According to the Associated Press, he "looked tired and grim" at a banquet held at the U.S. Embassy in the Philippines before leaving Manila.

Eisenhower is scheduled to arrive in Taipei on the morning of the 18th.

    去台湾进行新的阴谋活动
    艾森豪威尔离开马尼拉
    新华社17日讯　马尼拉消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔在菲律宾活动三天后，16日深夜搭乘美国重型巡洋舰“圣保罗号”离开马尼拉去台湾进行新的阴谋活动。
    据美联社报道，“他的神情很沉重”，因为在日本人民激烈抗议下被迫取消访问日本这个事实“败坏了这次旅行”。艾森豪威尔发表的告别演说很简短，避而不谈他被迫取消他的日本之行的事情。美联社承认，他在菲律宾的最后几小时中“引人注意的”一件事是“挨了日本人民的一记耳光”。
    据美联社报道，他在临离开马尼拉前在美国驻菲律宾大使馆举行的宴会上，“面色看起来很疲乏，很阴森”。
    艾森豪威尔预定在18日上午到台北。
