    Exposing the Lies of Modern-Day Münchhausen
    Dong Feng
    The American bandit chieftain Eisenhower, amidst the shouts of condemnation from the people of Asian countries, tucked his tail between his legs, shrank back, and scurried away in fear, ending his shameful Far East trip and fleeing back to his lair.
    Eisenhower’s bandit journey was a case of arriving adventurously and leaving with a bloody nose. This American president, who had always flaunted his power before the people of the world, became a drenched chicken in the storm of the Asian people’s anti-American struggle.
    Eisenhower's trip exposed the true nature of American imperialism as a paper tiger, revealing its utter ugliness. This farce aroused a chorus of mockery from world opinion. Even the American bandits' own propaganda machine had to admit that it was an "embarrassing and costly failure," but this shameless bandit pretended to be calm and tried his best to put lipstick on his shameful failure. When Eisenhower left Seoul under the condemnation of the Korean people to return home, he shamelessly said that he had received "cordial reception" and spent a "wonderful day," and also vigorously touted the "strength" of the American invading army in Korea. When the United Press International reported on the end of Eisenhower's bandit journey, it also reversed black and white and said that this "plague god" received an "extremely warm welcome." These self-aggrandizing shouts are truly laughable.
    American imperialism and its lackeys are most accustomed to spreading blatant lies in the face of ironclad facts to confuse the public. This shameless ugly appearance reminds people of the story of the lying master Baron Münchhausen in European fairy tales.
    The German writer Gottfried August Bürger wrote a book called "The Adventures of Baron Münchhausen." The protagonist of the book, Baron Münchhausen of the eighteenth century, boasted about his travels in a wildly exaggerated way. He fabricated that once while out hunting, he saw a row of wild geese flying in the sky, so he nocked an arrow and shot it, and with just one shot, he shot the row of geese onto the arrow like a string of candied haws.
    Baron Münchhausen is naturally a ridiculous "braggart." However, the lies of Eisenhower and his servants, the modern-day players of Baron Münchhausen, are even more ridiculous than the actions of that lying master. Baron Münchhausen's lies are just wild fabrications, boasting that he is a "heroic knight." But the lies of Eisenhower and his ilk have a more shameful purpose than Münchhausen. Eisenhower and the American bandit propaganda machine, in a state of utter poverty and panic, still have to cover up their shame; in the face of serious setbacks, they still have to boast of their "strength." The purpose is nothing more than: first, to make excuses for themselves, and second, to resolutely antagonize the Asian people, and try every means to intimidate and deceive them. However, no matter what tricks the American imperialists play, they cannot escape the fate of facing death. The increasingly awakened people of the world will neither be deceived by the American imperialists nor intimidated by the "brinkmanship policy." On the contrary, they will surely use more fierce struggles to defeat American imperialism until they send it to its grave. Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until extinction—this is the logic of imperialism. The lies of American imperialism cannot cover up the facts of its failure, and the attempt to make trouble again cannot escape the historical logic of its demise.

    揭穿现代慕恩好森的谎言
    东锋
    美国强盗头子艾森豪威尔，在亚洲各国人民一片喊打声中，锻羽缩首，抱头鼠窜，胆战心惊地结束了可耻的远东之行，逃回他的老窝去了。
    艾森豪威尔的强盗旅行，真是冒险而来，碰壁而去。这位一向在世界人民面前耀武扬威的美国总统，在亚洲人民反美斗争的风暴中，却成了落汤之鸡。
    艾森豪威尔的出行，使得美帝国主义纸老虎原形毕露，丑态百出。这一幕丑剧，引起世界舆论一片嘲笑声。就连美国强盗自己的宣传机器也不得不承认这是一次“丢脸的和代价重大的失败”，但是，这个厚颜无耻的强盗却故作镇静，竭力为自己这次可耻的失败涂脂抹粉。艾森豪威尔在朝鲜人民声讨之下离开汉城回国的时候，却厚着脸皮说是受到了“殷勤接待”，度过了“绝妙的一天”，并且还大肆吹嘘美国侵朝军队的“力量”。合众国际社在报道艾森豪威尔结束强盗旅行的时候，也颠倒黑白地说这个“瘟神”受到了“极其热烈的欢迎”。这些自吹自擂的叫嚷，听来真令人笑破肚皮。
    美帝国主义和它的奴仆们，最惯于在铁的事实面前散布弥天大谎，混淆视听的。这种不知羞耻的丑相，使人想起了欧洲童话中那个撒谎大师慕恩好森男爵的故事。
    德国作家高特弗立特·奥古斯特·毕尔格写过一本“慕恩好森旅行历险记”。书中的主人公、十八世纪的慕恩好森男爵信口开河地为自己的旅行吹嘘。他胡诌说，有一次外出行猎，看见空中飞着一行大雁，于是就拈弓搭箭，只一射，便把一行雁像一串冰糖葫芦似的射在箭上了。
    慕恩好森男爵自然是一个可笑的“牛皮大王”。然而，慕恩好森男爵的现代扮演者艾森豪威尔和他的仆从们的谎言，却比那个撒谎大师的行径更加可笑。慕恩好森男爵的谎言不过是信口开河，吹嘘自己是一位“英雄骑士”。可是艾森豪威尔之流的谎言，要比慕恩好森更加有着可耻的目的。艾森豪威尔和美国强盗的宣传机器，在穷相毕露、张惶失措的情形下，还要替自己掩丑遮羞；在受到严重打击的困境下，还要吹嘘自己“强大”。其目的不过是：一来为自己解嘲，二来坚决同亚洲人民为敌，千方百计地进行恫吓和欺骗。但是，不管美帝国主义者玩弄什么把戏，都解脱不了面临死亡的命运。日益觉悟的世界人民，既不会受美帝国主义者的欺骗，也不会被“战争边缘政策”吓倒，相反地，一定会用更猛烈的斗争战胜美帝国主义，直到把它送进坟墓。捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直到灭亡，这是帝国主义的逻辑。美帝国主义的谎言掩盖不了失败的事实，而企图再捣乱却是逃脱不了灭亡的历史逻辑的。
