    Another Self-Confession
    Luoding

    Eisenhower and Dulles, and their ilk, have always used the slander that the socialist camp is a "closed society" that "worships secrecy and concealment" as an excuse to prove that their despicable espionage and aggression are "necessary" and "justified." Now, they have gone a step further, using this gangster excuse as a new banner for advocating the Cold War and seeking world domination, revealing the full aggressive plan hidden behind this dark scheme.

    On June 4, Eisenhower openly clamored at a Republican Party dinner for "penetration" of socialist countries, "determined to make freedom ultimately triumph over tyranny." He shamelessly said, "We try to penetrate it, and I think we are doing the right thing." This means that the espionage activities carried out by the United States against socialist countries are merely part of its overall "penetration" activities, and this "penetration" activity is a means of "defeating" the socialist camp. Eisenhower confessed without being forced that the "penetration" devil he had been shouting about for a long time was not the socialist countries, but American imperialism and its head, Eisenhower himself; originally, it was not the socialist countries that attempted to "conquer the world" by force, but American imperialism and its head, Eisenhower himself.

    Following closely, Dulles reiterated Eisenhower's arrogant ambition, which he had publicly put forward in 1958, in a speech at the University of Pittsburgh: "Ultimately, (the world) must become a world family composed of open societies." At that time, Eisenhower was only trying to impose the "open skies plan," which aimed at military reconnaissance, on socialist countries to establish this "world family." In recent years, Eisenhower and other responsible American government officials have made it clear that this is actually the United States attempting to establish a "world order," or so-called "family of free men," that eliminates the sovereignty of the socialist camp and all independent countries and is dominated by the United States. Now, this extremely arrogant aggressive goal has been thoroughly exposed.

    Dulles bluntly said, "As long as there are...closed societies, the central political problems of our time will be difficult to solve." Doesn't this expose very bluntly that the ultimate goal of the United States in solving "political problems" is to eliminate socialist countries? Dulles specifically mentioned the issue of disarmament. He insisted that the key to disarmament is to "make progress in arms supervision." Since socialist countries are unwilling to "open" their societies to the United States, the political problem of disarmament cannot be solved. In the eyes of the United States, the issue of disarmament is just a matter of allowing the United States to penetrate and subvert socialist countries and establish the American "world family." For those who still fantasize that the United States will accept disarmament, thereby permanently eliminating war, Dulles is truly a good negative example.

    Dulles only expressed great interest in the "political problem" of "East-West exchange." He particularly emphasized that the main thing is not "cultural and educational exchange," but "should be political," including "the interaction of leaders." In this regard, such a ferocious monster as Dulles immediately transforms into a kind "peace-loving person," saying that the United States is willing to "explore all opportunities to put our (relationship with the socialist camp) at a more hopeful level where understanding and common cooperation are increased." How beautifully said! However, Dulles's fox tail cannot be hidden at all. He said that this "exchange" is "the foundation for building a real world family!" Dulles also cited the words of the notorious former Secretary of State Dulles to prove the "special significance" of the "exchange program" for the United States to establish a "world family." He said that this program can "strengthen the ties between friends and narrow the gaps between adversaries." Using the report issued by the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee to annotate, this is to "try to establish extensive contacts with intellectuals in the communist bloc, and finally with middle and upper-level politicians," and use the "attraction of Western economic recovery" and "the ties of traditional culture" to "promote the evolution within the communist bloc." It can be seen that the "East-West exchange" referred to by American imperialism is only for the purpose of "penetration" and "opening."

    The Eisenhower government has intensified its arms expansion and war preparations after sabotaging the summit conference, and its hideous face has been exposed. Now, Eisenhower and Dulles and their ilk have come out to talk a lot of fallacies such as "open society," which will help people to recognize the essence of American imperialism.

    又一次自我招供
    洛丁
    艾森豪威尔和赫脱之流，一直以诬蔑社会主义阵营是一个“封闭的社会”，“崇拜保密和隐藏”为借口，来证明他们实行卑鄙的间谍侵略活动是“必要的”、“正当的”。现在，他们更进了一步，把这种强盗借口作为鼓吹冷战、鼓吹独霸世界的新的旗号，和盘托出了隐藏在这个黑色勾当背后的全部侵略计划。
    6月4日，艾森豪威尔在共和党宴会上公然叫嚷要对社会主义国家进行“渗透”，“决心要使自由最后战胜专制”。他并无耻地说，“我们尝试渗透它，我认为我们是做得正确的”。这就是说，美国对社会主义国家进行的间谍活动，不过是它的整个“渗透”活动的一部分，而这个“渗透”活动又是“战胜”社会主义阵营的一种手段。艾森豪威尔不打自招地供认了，原来他长期来大叫大嚷的“渗透”魔鬼，不是社会主义国家，而是美帝国主义及其头子艾森豪威尔自己；原来妄图以武力“征服世界”的，不是社会主义国家，而是美帝国主义及其头子艾森豪威尔自己。
    赫脱紧跟着在匹兹堡大学发表演说中，重申了艾森豪威尔在1958年就公开提出的狂妄野心：“最后必须（使世界）成为一个由开放的社会组成的世界大家庭。”艾森豪威尔在当时还只是企图把旨在进行军事侦察的“开放天空的计划”，强加在社会主义国家身上，来建立这个“世界大家庭”。近年来艾森豪威尔和其他美国政府负责官员表明，这实际上是，美国妄图建立一个消灭社会主义阵营和一切独立国家的主权、而由美国独霸世界的“世界秩序”，或所谓“自由人的大家庭”。现在，这一嚣张到了极点的侵略目标，更是彻底地暴露出来了。
    赫脱毫不讳言地说，“只要还存在……封闭的社会，我们时代的中心的政治问题就很难解决。”这不是十分露骨地暴露了：美国解决“政治问题”的终极目的，都是为了消灭社会主义国家吗？赫脱特别提到裁军问题。他坚持裁军的关键是“在军备监督方面取得进展”。由于社会主义国家不愿把自己的社会“开放”给美国，裁军这个政治问题就不能够解决。在美国看来，裁军问题就只是应该任由美国渗透和颠复社会主义国家，建立美国的“世界大家庭”的问题。这对于那些还幻想美国会接受裁军，从而可以永远消除战争的人来说，赫脱真是一个很好的反面教员。
    赫脱只有对“东西方交流”这个“政治问题”，表示极大的兴趣。他特别强调，主要的不是“文教交流”，而“应当是政治性的”，包括“领袖的交往”。在这方面，赫脱这样的凶神恶煞，就立即摇身一变而为善良的“和平人士”，说什么美国愿意“探索一切可以取得的机会，来使我们（同社会主义阵营）的关系处于了解和共同合作有所增进这一更富有希望的水平上”。说得多么漂亮呀！但是，赫脱的狐狸尾巴一点也掩藏不住，他说，这种“交流”是“建立一个真正的世界大家庭的基础！”赫脱还援引臭名远扬的故国务卿杜勒斯的话，来证明“交流计划”对美国建立“世界大家庭”的“特殊意义”。他说，这个计划可以“加强朋友之间的联系，缩小敌对者之间的鸿沟”。用美国参议院外交委员会发表的报告来注释，这就是，要“设法同共产主义集团的知识分子，最后同中上层政治家建立广泛的联系”，并利用“西方经济恢复的吸引力”和“传统文化的联系”，以“促进共产主义集团内部的演变”。可见，美帝国主义所说的“东西方交流”，目的只是为了“渗透”和“开放”。
    艾森豪威尔政府在破坏首脑会议之后，加紧进行扩军备战活动，使它的狰狞面目已暴露无遗。现在，艾森豪威尔和赫脱之流，又出来大讲一通“开放社会”等等的谬论，更有助于人们认识美帝国主义的本质。
