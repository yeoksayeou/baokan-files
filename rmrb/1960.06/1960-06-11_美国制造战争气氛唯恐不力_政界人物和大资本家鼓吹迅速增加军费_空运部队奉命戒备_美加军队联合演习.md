Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 9th June: The United States continues to take measures to strengthen its arms expansion and war preparations.

The Senate Appropriations Subcommittee passed a resolution on the 8th, advocating an increase of $850 million in the military budget to fully develop the Air Force's B-70 bomber system. The subcommittee also intends to restore funding for the development of the "Bomarc" missile system.

Monopoly capital magnate and Governor of New York State, Rockefeller, held secret talks with Republican leaders yesterday, and he also issued a special statement demanding an increase of $3.5 billion in military spending to develop new weapons.

Activities to create war hysteria within the United States are also being intensified. The 82nd Airborne Division, with a strength of 10,000 troops, was suddenly assembled at Fort Bragg yesterday for "alert" status. Yesterday, a joint military "exercise" between the United States and Canada, simulating the use of intercontinental missiles, was also held in Colorado.
