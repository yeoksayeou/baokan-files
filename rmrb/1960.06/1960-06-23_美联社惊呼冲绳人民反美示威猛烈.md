Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd. American news agencies are still shaken after the fierce demonstrations by the people of Okinawa who rose up to drive away the plague god Eisenhower. The Associated Press, in a dispatch from Tokyo yesterday, said that "the United States has once again been subjected to 'very effective' demonstrations in its most strategically important Far East stronghold," the dispatch exclaimed. The demonstration was "much larger than predicted" and "exceeded, in both numbers and the intensity of its militancy," any "activities that openly troubled the United States" for many years.

The dispatch admitted that the American occupation has made it impossible for "the 850,000 Okinawans to maintain a life better than mere survival."

    美联社惊呼冲绳人民反美示威猛烈
    新华社22日讯　美国通讯社对冲绳人民奋起轰走瘟神艾森豪威尔的猛烈示威，事后犹有余悸。美联社昨天在从东京发出的一条电讯中说，“美国又一次在它的最有战略意义的远东据点”遭到了“很有成效”的示威斗争，电讯惊呼。这次示威比“预测的要大得多”，而且，“在人数上和战斗性的强烈程度上都超出了”许多年来“公开同美国为难的活动”。
    这条电讯承认，美国的占领使得“八十五万冲绳人没有可能保持比荀延残喘的水平更好的生活”。
