Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Public opinion in various countries commemorates the tenth anniversary of the Korean people's war of resistance against American aggression.

　　　　Vietnam's "Nhan Dan" says
　　　　U.S. Defeat in Korea Exposed the Paper Tiger Nature
Vietnam's "Nhan Dan" published an editorial on the 25th for "Day of Joint Struggle to Force the Withdrawal of US Troops from South Korea," stating that the Vietnamese people resolutely support the Korean people in driving the US aggressor troops out of South Korea. The editorial pointed out that only by uniting as one, fighting resolutely, driving US imperialism out of South Korea, and overthrowing the dictatorial rule of the Heo Jeong group, can South Korea be liberated and Korea be unified.

"Nhan Dan" also published an article on the 25th pointing out that when US imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea ten years ago, it suffered the most devastating defeat in the history of American aggression, thereby exposing the paper tiger nature of US imperialism. The article said that the great victory of the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers in defeating US imperialism made a significant contribution to defending peace and security in Asia and the Pacific region and powerfully encouraged the world's forces of peace.

　　　　Bulgaria's "Otechestven Front" says
　　　　The Greatest Enemy of the Korean People is US Imperialism
Bulgaria's "Otechestven Front" wrote, "Now, the Korean people know more clearly than ever that their greatest enemy is US imperialism." The newspaper said that it has been seven years since the Korean armistice, but US troops are still occupying South Korea, obstructing the Korean people from unifying their country through peaceful means.

"Zemedelsko Zname" wrote, "In the face of the heroic Korean and Chinese soldiers, the American robbers were forced to sign the armistice agreement." The newspaper pointed out, "As long as the American aggressors do not withdraw from South Korea and the Far East, there can be no peace and security in these regions."

　　　　Czechoslovakia's "Rude Pravo" says
　　　　American Aggressors Can Be Defeated
Czechoslovakia's "Rude Pravo" published an article on the 25th stating that the victory achieved by the Korean people with the support of socialist countries, especially China, has proven that, like the German, Italian, and Japanese aggressors during World War II, American aggressors can be defeated.

The newspaper said that imperialism has no way to stop the collapse of their positions one after another.

The article concluded by expressing full support for the Korean people's struggle to demand the withdrawal of American occupation forces and the unification of the country, believing that this is part of a strong struggle to strengthen world peace.

　　　　"Sovetskaya Rossiya" says
　　　　US Troop Withdrawal from Korea is the Only Way to Peaceful Reunification
A commentary in "Sovetskaya Rossiya" said that only the withdrawal of US troops from Korea can lay the foundation for the peaceful reunification of Korea.

"Trud" wrote that recent events in South Korea have proven the complete bankruptcy of the anti-people policy. The American occupation troops should withdraw from South Korea. Only the Korean people themselves have the right to decide their own destiny.

　　　　Hungary's "Népszabadság" says
　　　　The U.S. and its Puppets Obstruct Peaceful Reunification of Korea
Hungary's "Népszabadság" published an article on the 25th on the tenth anniversary of the Korean people's war of resistance against US imperialist aggression, pointing out that the peace of the world should be vigilantly defended, because the reactionary forces that invaded Korea ten years ago are still active today and threaten human tranquility.

The article said that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has put forward many proposals for the peaceful reunification of Korea, but the US occupiers and their puppets in South Korea have been obstructing the implementation of these proposals. The article pointed out that the biggest obstacle to Korean unification is the foreign military presence.

　　　　Cuba's "Hoy" says
　　　　Imperialism Cannot Stop People Determined to Defend Their Country to the Death
Cuba's "Hoy," on the tenth anniversary of the US launching the war of aggression against Korea, pointed out that the Korean War proved that US imperialism is not invincible.

The commentary said that Korea has given the American aggressors a lesson: "No puppet army, no imperialist army, and no kind of terror can stop people who are determined to defend their homeland to the death."

The commentary pointed out that the chain of Washington's defeats is beginning to grow longer and longer, and Japan is the most recent example.

　　　　Secretary-General of the All-India Peace Council, Chandra, says
　　　　US Troops Should Pack Up and Go Back to America
Secretary-General of the All-India Peace Council, Romesh Chandra, published an article in a recent issue of the "New Age" weekly, saying that let Indian workers and farmers and all the people, on this day of the tenth anniversary of the outbreak of the war of aggression against Korea, demand in unison: US troops should pack up their luggage, nuclear weapons, rockets, missiles, etc., and go back to America, and let the Korean people decide their own destiny.

The article pointed out that the US military occupation is the root cause of the darkness and hardship brought to South Korea, and said that Eisenhower's hasty trip to South Korea to try to suppress the flames of freedom was in vain. These flames of freedom will rise higher and higher until the US military occupation is eliminated from the land of Korea.

The article pointed out that "the struggle for the withdrawal of US troops is part of the struggle for peace in Asia and the world, and for the independence and sovereignty of the people of all Asian countries."

　　　　The Burmese Trade Union Congress issued a statement
　　　　US Troops Must Withdraw from South Korea Immediately
The Burmese Trade Union Congress issued a statement on the 24th stating that US troops must withdraw from South Korea immediately. The unification of Korea must be realized in accordance with the will and aspirations of the Korean people.

The statement also demanded that the US aggressors immediately withdraw from Japan, South Vietnam, Taiwan, and other regions.

The statement praised the heroic struggle of the Korean people against the tyranny of Syngman Rhee and condemned Eisenhower's recent "visit" to South Korea. The statement said that Eisenhower's "visit" was to strengthen the US suppression of the South Korean people.

      美国及其傀儡阻挠朝鲜和平统一

    文章指出，美军占领是给南朝鲜带来黑暗和困难的根本原因，并且说，艾森豪威尔匆匆赶到南朝鲜去企图镇压自由的火焰是枉费心机。这种自由火焰将更加高涨起来，直到美军的占领在朝鲜的土地上被消除为止。
