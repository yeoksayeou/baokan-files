Xinhua News Agency, 7th (Washington dispatch) – U.S. authorities are continuing to stage all kinds of war-mongering hysterical "drills" domestically.

An official U.S. research institution in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, drove twenty-nine American citizens into a small cave supposedly designed to protect against nuclear weapons damage for an "experiment." Among these twenty-nine people used as "experimental animals" were seven-year-old children and seventy-two-year-old elderly people. They entered the cave on June 5 and will stay there for two weeks, where their diet will be restricted.

It is reported that this "experiment" is being conducted by the U.S. Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization.

In addition, Burlington, New Jersey, also held a so-called "civil defense exercise" on the 4th and 5th. All three hundred households in this small city were forced to leave their homes and spend two nights in the nearby forest.

    在国内举行煽动战争歇斯底里的演习竟用小孩老人作“防避核武器”试验
    新华社7日讯　华盛顿消息：美国当局正继续在国内举行各式各样的煽动战争歇斯底里的“演习”。
    美国一个官方研究机构在宾夕法尼亚州的匹兹堡驱使二十九名美国公民进入一个所谓防避核武器伤害的狭小的洞穴里进行“试验”。在这二十九个作为“试验动物”的人中，有七岁的小孩，也有七十二岁的老人。他们从6月5日进入这个洞穴，要在里面停留两个星期。在那里，他们的饮食将受到限制。
    据报道，这个“试验”是由美国民间和国防动员署主持的。
    另外，新泽西州的柏林敦在4日和5日也举行了一次所谓“民防演习”。这个小城市的全部三百户人家被迫离家，到附近的森林里度过两个晚上。
