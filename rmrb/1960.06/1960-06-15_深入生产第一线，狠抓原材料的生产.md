Since the beginning of this year, the situation on the industrial front has been very good. The surging technical revolution movement has produced tremendous results. In the first five months, the industrial output value increased much more than originally expected compared with the same period last year. Labor productivity has greatly improved, and many major products have seen significant growth. Our task now is to continue our efforts, delve deeply into the front lines of production, earnestly solve the various practical problems currently faced, and ensure a substantial increase in industrial production. A crucial issue that needs to be vigorously addressed right now is to greatly increase the production of raw materials. We must vigorously grasp the production of raw materials, materials, and fuels, and make increasing production and practicing economy in raw materials, materials, and fuels the main direction of attack for the current sustained leap forward in industrial production.

With the further development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the production capacity of all industrial sectors has greatly improved. The large increase in production capacity inevitably leads to a sharp increase in the demand for raw materials, materials, and fuels. For example, major raw materials such as steel, iron, and coal have all seen significant growth in the first five months of this year compared with the same period last year. However, the production capacity of processing industries using raw materials has increased at a greater rate and faster speed. For example, after the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory reformed the technology of the tapping process, the annual output of taps immediately increased from 320,000 pieces to 2.7 million pieces. Thus, the demand for raw materials for this process increased by more than seven times. The rapid increase in the demand for raw materials is a great thing, indicating that our industrial production is in a good situation of substantial growth. As long as we vigorously grasp the production of raw materials and, at the same time, continuously strengthen transportation and other related production aspects, we will be able to achieve a new balance between the manufacturing and processing capacity and the demand for raw materials in industrial production, and make production take another big leap forward. Therefore, tightly and vigorously grasping the production of raw materials is the key to ensuring the completion and over-fulfillment of this year's continued leap forward plan.

Since the production of raw materials is the key to sustained leap forward, can the production of raw materials be substantially increased? The fact that the Zhao Gezhuang Mine of Kailuan Coal Mine in Hebei Province increased coal mining efficiency by one to two times after adopting new coal mining methods powerfully illustrates that the production potential of raw material departments is very large. As long as leading cadres go deep into the front lines of production, widely mobilize the masses, vigorously carry out technical revolutions, and adhere to the use of new technologies and new experiences in production, production capacity can be greatly increased. In addition to raw material production departments accelerating the expansion and improvement of production capacity and increasing the production of raw materials as much as possible, it is also necessary to grasp an important link, which is that the finished product manufacturing and processing departments that use raw materials should also develop diversified operations in accordance with local conditions and factory conditions, vigorously carry out comprehensive utilization, and increase the production and conservation of raw materials through self-reliance. Whether it is the raw material production department or the finished product manufacturing and processing department that uses raw materials, this approach of breaking down industry boundaries and having everyone work together to grasp the production of raw materials is a revolutionary measure that adapts to the requirements of the current objective situation and has extremely important significance. Processing enterprises producing part of the raw materials themselves is not only of great importance to ensuring the sustained leap forward of the enterprise, but also of great benefit to the development and rational layout of existing industrial enterprises, and is a correct way to solve the problem of raw material production and supply. Is it really possible for processing enterprises to produce a portion of the raw materials themselves? The example of Luoyang Mining Machinery Factory in Henan Province shows that it is entirely possible. Because the degree of mechanization of this factory has increased in the technical revolution, this year's production plan has more than doubled compared with last year. Although the raw materials allocated to them by the state in the first quarter of this year increased by 50% compared with the same period last year, they could only meet their needs for two months. In this case, they immediately adopted the method of producing raw materials themselves, vigorously established satellite factories, and established their own raw material bases. In the past few months, they have produced twelve kinds of raw materials such as steel and ferrosilicon. The ferrosilicon produced not only met the needs of the factory, but also supported more than 30 fraternal units. They also established a steel rolling workshop to ensure the need for various specifications of round steel. As a result, although the raw materials allocated to this factory this year were insufficient, they still managed to over-fulfill their production plan every month.

While increasing the production of raw materials, vigorously carrying out comprehensive utilization of resources, widely finding various substitutes, and continuously carrying out reforms in production methods, process methods, and product design are another important aspect that cannot be ignored in grasping raw materials. It is not only conducive to increasing production and saving raw materials, but also an effective way to improve industrial technology and give the fullest play to equipment utilization efficiency. For example, many reforms in coal mining methods that have recently emerged in the coal production sector have not only increased coal production and saved wood, but also greatly simplified the production process, making coal production more scientific and rational, and improving the technical level of the coal industry. Another example is that the Shenyang Low-Voltage Switch Factory improved the design of explosion-proof magnetic starters. The material that was originally used to make one unit can now be used to make four units, and the service life of each unit has been increased four times compared with the past. This proves that the avenues for saving raw materials are also very wide.

Increasing production and saving raw materials is an important key to ensuring a sustained leap forward in production and guaranteeing the completion and over-fulfillment of this year's annual production leap forward plan. However, to do this work well, it is necessary to have a focus. Only by carrying out this movement on the premise of ensuring the rapid growth of key raw materials can it truly be conducive to the leap forward of the entire production. The key raw materials for increasing production and conservation at present are steel, iron, coal, ore, coke, as well as petroleum, chemical raw materials, wood, cement, light industrial raw materials, and so on. Among them, steel must be taken as the key link, and the increase in production and transportation of coal, pig iron, ore, and coke must be vigorously grasped. For steel production, ore, as a raw material, is a link that particularly needs to be grasped at present. With steel, other things will also be driven. Steel is the most used, widest used, and most important raw material in production and construction. Its increase in production is not only related to industrial production and construction, but also related to the leap forward in agriculture, and is the foundation for the sustained leap forward of the entire national economy. Making every effort to promote a substantial increase in steel production will inevitably drive the sustained leap forward of the entire industrial production.

At present, many enterprises across the country have launched a new upsurge of mass movements to increase production and save raw materials, materials, and fuels; many enterprises have found successful experiences in promoting a substantial increase in raw material production. As long as we earnestly improve our leadership style, delve deeply into the front lines of production, further mobilize the masses, vigorously grasp the central link of raw material production, and continuously create, continuously promote, and adhere to the use of new technologies and new experiences in increasing raw material production, there will inevitably be a high tide of great development and great growth in raw material production.

    深入生产第一线，狠抓原材料的生产
    今年以来工业战线上的形势很好。奔腾澎湃的技术革命运动已经产生了巨大的效果。前五个月的工业产值和去年同期相比，增长的幅度比原来预期的要大得多，劳动生产率大大提高了，许多主要产品都有了很大的增长。现在我们的任务是再接再厉，深入生产第一线，切切实实地解决当前各种实际问题，保证工业生产大幅度地增长。当前需要狠狠抓紧的一个十分重要的关键问题，就是大力增加原材料生产。狠抓原料、材料和燃料的生产，把增产节约原料、材料和燃料作为当前工业生产持续跃进的主攻方向。
    随着技术革新和技术革命运动的进一步深入开展，一切工业部门的生产能力都大大地提高了。生产能力的大提高，就必然带来原料、材料和燃料需要量的猛烈增长。例如钢、铁、煤等主要原材料，今年头五个月比去年同期都有很大增长。但是使用原材料的加工工业的生产能力增长的幅度更大、速度更快。比如哈尔滨量具刃具厂改革了制丝锥这个工序的技术以后，丝锥的年产量立即由三十二万件上升为二百七十万件。这样，这个工序的原材料需要量一下就增长了七倍多。原材料需要量的急速增加，是一件大好事情，这说明我们的工业生产正处在大幅度增长的良好形势下，只要我们狠抓原材料的生产，同时，不断地加强交通运输及其它有关生产方面的工作，就能够使工业生产中的制造加工能力和原材料需求之间的不平衡达到新的平衡，使生产再向前大大地跃进一步。所以，紧抓、狠抓原材料的生产，是保证完成和超额完成今年继续跃进计划的关键。
    原材料的生产既然是持续跃进中的关键，那末，原材料生产能不能大幅度增加呢？河北开滦煤矿赵各庄矿采用新的采煤法以后，采煤工效提高一至二倍的事实，有力地说明了原材料部门的生产潜力是很大的，只要领导干部深入生产第一线，广泛发动群众，大搞技术革命，并且在生产中坚持使用新技术、新经验，生产能力完全可以大幅度增长。除了原材料生产部门要尽量加速扩大和提高生产能力，增产原材料而外，还要抓紧一个重要环节，这就是在使用原材料的成品制造加工部门，也要因地制宜，因厂制宜地发展多种经营，大搞综合利用，自力更生地增产和节约原材料。无论是原材料生产部门还是使用原材料的成品制造加工部门，这种打破行业界限大家一齐动手抓原材料生产的作法，是适应当前客观形势要求的一项革命措施，有着极为重要的意义。加工企业自己生产部分原材料，不仅对保证本企业持续跃进有着重大作用，而且对现有工业企业的发展与合理布局也有很大好处，是一条解决原材料生产、供应问题的正确途径。加工企业自己生产一部分原材料究竟能不能办到呢？河南洛阳矿山机器厂的例子说明是完全可以办到的。这个厂由于在技术革命中机械化程度提高了，今年生产计划比去年增长了一倍多。今年第一季度国家分配给他们的原材料虽然比去年同期增长了50％，却只能满足他们两个月的需要。在这种情况下，他们立即采取了自己动手生产原材料的办法，大办卫星工厂，自己建立原料基地。几个月来他们已经生产钢材、矽铁等十二种原材料，生产的矽铁不但满足了本厂需要，还支援了三十多个兄弟单位。他们还建立了轧钢车间，保证了各种规格圆钢的需要。结果是，这个厂今年以来虽然分配到的原材料不足，却仍然做到了月月超额完成生产计划。
    在增产原材料的同时，大搞资源的综合利用，广找各种代用品，不断地进行生产方法、工艺方法和产品设计的改革，是大抓原材料中不可忽视的另一个重要方面。它不仅有利于增产和节约原材料，也是提高工业技术水平和最充分地发挥设备利用效能的有效途径。例如最近煤炭生产部门中出现的许多采煤方法的改革，不但增产了煤炭，节约了木材，还大大简化了生产过程，使煤炭生产更加科学合理，提高了煤炭工业的技术水平。再比如沈阳低压开关厂改进了防爆磁力起动器的设计，原来做一台的材料可以做四台了，而且每台的使用寿命比过去提高了四倍。这证明了节约原材料的门路也是十分宽广的。
    增产节约原材料是确保生产持续跃进，保证完成和超额完成今年全年生产跃进计划的重要关键。但是，要作好这件工作还必须要有重点。只有在确保重点原材料迅速增长的前提下开展这个运动，才能真正有利于整个生产的跃进。当前增产节约的重点原材料是钢、铁、煤、矿石、焦炭以及石油、化工原料、木材、水泥、轻工业原料等等。其中又必须以钢为纲，狠抓煤炭、生铁、矿石、焦炭的增产和运输。对于钢铁生产来说，矿石这个原料又是当前特别需要抓紧的一个环节。有了钢铁，也就带动了其它。钢铁是生产建设中使用最多最广最重要的原材料，它的增产不仅关系到工业的生产和建设，也关系到农业的跃进，是整个国民经济持续跃进的基础。千方百计促进钢铁生产大幅度增长，就必然会带动整个工业生产持续跃进。
    现在，全国各地许多企业已经掀起了以增产节约原料、材料和燃料的群众运动的新高潮；许多企业已经找到了促进原材料生产大幅度增长的成功经验。只要我们认真改进领导作风，深入生产第一线，进一步发动群众，狠狠地抓住原材料生产这个中心环节，不断创造、不断推广和坚持使用增产原材料的新技术、新经验，原材料生产必然会有一个大发展、大增长的高潮。
