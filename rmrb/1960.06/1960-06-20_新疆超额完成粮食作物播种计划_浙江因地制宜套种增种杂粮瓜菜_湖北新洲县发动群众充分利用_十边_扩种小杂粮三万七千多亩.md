    Xinjiang has launched a campaign to exceed its planting plans, focusing on increasing grain production. Currently, people's communes across the region have concentrated approximately 30% of their labor force to open up wasteland, build water conservancy projects, and sow seeds in the vast wilderness north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. Farmers of all ethnic groups are determined to seize the opportunity before the busy summer harvest season to rush planting, striving to exceed the planned grain planting area by 15%. As of the end of May, the total grain planting area in the autonomous region had exceeded the state plan, reaching over 27 million mu, an increase of more than 32% compared to the same period last year.

    Adhering to the simultaneous pursuit of "more production through more planting" and "more production through high yields" is the main experience of the autonomous region's Party committee in leading agricultural production in recent years. Xinjiang has a small population and a cultivated area of just over 40 million mu, with relatively extensive farming practices. Therefore, only by striving to plant more can the needs of the rapidly extending Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway and the major development of the autonomous region's industry be guaranteed. This year, from the very beginning of spring planting, Party committees at all levels have focused on the three key aspects of "planting more, planting early, and planting well." The planting area for winter and spring wheat has been expanded by more than 4 million mu, an increase of over 37%, exceeding the plan by 13%. The planting area for early corn has been expanded by 38%, and the planting quality is also better than in previous years.

    In order to ensure that the planting area could be exceeded, people's communes in various regions have organized wasteland reclamation professional teams this year, giving full play to the superiority of the people's communes' "large scale and high degree of public ownership," rationally arranging labor, and persisting in farmland capital construction such as year-round wasteland reclamation and water conservancy projects. They have also implemented a strategy of simultaneous wasteland reclamation and planting, changing the past practice of generally concentrating large-scale wasteland reclamation in winter, ensuring a rapid increase in the planting area. According to incomplete statistics, the area of wasteland reclaimed and planted this year is more than 4 million mu, an increase of about 100% compared to last year. As of now, the counties in the Hotan area have reclaimed over 900,000 mu of wasteland with water conservancy facilities, an average increase of more than one mu of paddy field per person, which can basically be planted this year. As of now, the Turpan County has reclaimed 110,000 mu of wasteland that can be planted, an increase of more than 400% compared to last year, and is now rushing to plant sorghum.

    Currently, people's communes in Xinjiang are actively tapping potential to plant more and more. According to statistics from thirteen regions, including Hotan, Kashgar, Hami, Tacheng, Changji, and the counties in the Turpan Basin, the planting of grain and oil crops will be expanded by more than 3 million mu.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou. Zhejiang: People's communes in various regions are implementing the policy of "multiple planting, high yield, and more income," making full use of forest land, gardens, and scattered land to intercrop and expand planting of crops such as melons, vegetables, coarse grains, feed, and oil crops, totaling more than 6 million mu.

    While vigorously carrying out field management of early rice, cotton, and hemp crops, people's communes in Zhejiang have adopted a combination of establishing professional teams and organizing mass shock campaigns to widely carry out intercropping and expanded planting. Thanks to the concerted efforts of the vast number of commune members, intercropping and expanded planting in many areas have been both plentiful and rapid. In addition to transferring more than 13,000 commune members to establish nearly 400 professional teams dedicated to intercropping and expanded planting, the communes in Linhai County organized more than 150,000 commune members to launch a five-day shock campaign after the completion of early rice transplanting, planting 280,000 mu of melons, vegetables, coarse grains, and oil crops.

    In the large-scale intercropping and expanded planting, all regions have been making every effort to plant more according to local conditions based on the different characteristics of mountainous areas, plains, and coastal areas. In mountainous areas, communes have focused on intercropping in forests. The communes in Chun'an County transferred 15,000 commune members to organize more than 500 intercropping professional teams, intercropping 80,000 mu of corn, peanuts, soybeans, and vegetables in tea gardens, orchards, and oil tea gardens. In the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou plain area, in addition to intercropping in mulberry gardens, the "Ten Edges" were widely utilized for expanded planting. Many communes have also utilized water surfaces such as rivers, ponds, lakes, and reservoirs to raise aquatic plants. People's communes in the coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang have also made full use of tidal flats (beach land) for expanded planting.

    Currently, more than one million mu of sweet potato vines have been pressed throughout the province. In some counties and communes in southern Zhejiang, where the season is earlier, the planting plan for sweet potatoes has been completed.

    Currently, Zhejiang is stepping up the cultivation and management of intercropped and expanded planted crops.

    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan. Hubei: Xinzhou County is trying every possible means to expand the area of summer crops.

    The county's actual harvested wheat area this year is about 100,000 mu larger than last year, which is the result of the large-scale mountain and lake management campaign centered on water conservancy last year. Can the area of summer crops be further expanded this year? After discussions among cadres and the masses at all levels, the county made a plan for "five expansions." The so-called "five expansions" are: first, expand the summer planting area; second, expand the late autumn replanting area; third, expand high-yield crops; fourth, expand the area of oil crops and various small grains; fifth, expand the area of improved varieties. How can the "five expansions" be realized? The main thing is to mobilize the masses to utilize all available idle land according to local conditions, truly achieving "planting whenever soil is seen" and "inserting needles in every crack." After leading cadres went deep among the masses for visits and discussions, measures were proposed to utilize the "Ten Edges," that is, to reclaim and utilize the vacant land along lake edges, river edges (the county is along the river and lake), embankment edges, canal edges, reservoir edges, ditch edges, mountain edges, field edges, road edges, and village edges. According to a preliminary investigation, the "Ten Edges" can be used to plant tens of thousands of mu of summer crops. In order to ensure that all these lands are planted, planted well, managed well, and harvested, it is necessary to correctly and thoroughly publicize and implement the wasteland reclamation policy, and clearly stipulate based on the different situations of land concentration and dispersion: large pieces of wasteland should be operated by the commune or production team (wherever the production team has the strength to operate, the commune should try its best to let the production team operate it), small pieces of land should be operated by the small team, and scattered land in front of and behind houses should be operated by individual commune members in order to improve the production and management enthusiasm of production teams and commune members.

    The specific measures of using the "Ten Edges" to carry out the "Five Expansions" have taken root in the hearts of cadres and the masses at all levels in this county, and have quickly formed a mass action. In addition to early rice, mid-season rice, wheat stubble cotton, and other miscellaneous grain crops, which have all completed the planting tasks according to the "Five Expansions" planning indicators, the county's 200,000-strong labor force is now fighting in shifts in a led and orderly manner. A fixed group of special classes is responsible for wheat threshing, striving to return the grain to the granary. Another batch of teams is launching a shock attack on the field management of the autumn-harvested crops that have already been planted. There is also a batch of teams that are continuing to make unremitting efforts to carry out the task of rushing planting on the "Ten Edges" and the "Five Expansions," adopting the "simultaneous wasteland reclamation, land preparation, fertilization, and planting" approach, with a very strong momentum. The vast number of commune members also used their spare time to plant small grains and vegetables in front of and behind their houses as a source of income for their household sideline businesses. As of now, the county has expanded the planting of more than 37,000 mu of small grains using the "Ten Edges," and another 30,000 mu of newly opened wasteland is also being prepared for planting.

    新疆超额完成粮食作物播种计划  浙江因地制宜套种增种杂粮瓜菜
    湖北新洲县发动群众充分利用“十边”扩种小杂粮三万七千多亩
    本报讯　新疆农村掀起了一个以增种粮食为中心的超计划播种运动。目前各地人民公社集中了30％左右的劳力，在天山南北大片荒原上，边开荒、边修水利、边播种。各族农民决心利用夏收大忙季节到来以前的时机抢播，力争粮食播种面积超过计划15％。截至5月底统计，全自治区粮食播种面积已经超额完成了国家计划，达到两千七百多万亩，比去年同期增加32％以上。
    坚持多种多收和高产多收同时并举，是自治区党委几年来领导农业生产的主要经验。新疆人口少，耕地面积不过四千多万亩，耕作比较粗放。因此只有尽力多种才能保证兰新铁路迅速延伸和自治区工业建设大发展对粮食的需要。今年各级党委从春播一开始，就狠抓了多种、种早、种好这三个环节，冬春小麦的播种面积比去年扩大了四百多万亩，增加了37％以上，超过计划13％，早玉米播种面积扩大了38％，播种质量也都较往年为好。
    各地人民公社为了保证播种面积能够超额完成，今年都组织了开荒专业队，充分发挥了人民公社一大二公的优越性，合理安排了劳力，坚持了常年开荒、修水利等农田基本建设，并实行边开荒、边播种，改变了过去一般都集中在冬季进行大规模开荒的状况，保证了播种面积迅速增加。据不完全统计，今年开荒今年播种的面积有四百多万亩，比去年增加一倍左右。和田专区各县到目前已开出有水利设施的荒地九十多万亩，每人平均增加一亩多水田，基本上今年都能播种。吐鲁番县到目前已经开出可以播种的荒地十一万亩，比去年增加四倍以上，现正抢种高粱。
    现在，新疆各人民公社正积极挖掘潜力，多种、再多种。据和田、喀什、哈密、塔城、昌吉以及吐鲁番盆地各县等十三个地区的统计，将扩大播种粮食和油料作物三百多万亩。
    本报讯　浙江各地人民公社贯彻执行多种高产多收的方针，充分利用林地、园地和零星土地套种扩种瓜菜、杂粮、饲料和油料等作物六百多万亩。
    浙江各人民公社在大力做好早稻、棉、麻等作物的田间管理的同时，采取建立专业队和组织群众性突击相结合的办法，广泛进行套种扩种。由于广大社员齐动手，许多地区套种扩种又多又快。临海县各公社除了抽调一万三千多社员建立近四百个专业队专门进行套种扩种外，又在早稻插秧结束以后，组织十五万多社员突击五天，种下二十八万亩瓜菜、杂粮和油料作物。
    各地在大搞套种扩种中，都根据山区、平原和沿海等不同特点，因地制宜尽量多种。在山区，各公社大抓林间套种。淳安县各公社抽调一万五千名社员组织了五百多个套种专业队，在茶园、果园、油茶园地套种上八万亩玉米、花生、大豆、蔬菜。杭（州）嘉（兴）湖（州）平原地区除了在桑园套种外，广泛利用“十边”扩种。许多公社还利用了河、塘、湖、库等水面，放养水生植物。浙东沿海地区的人民公社还充分利用海涂（海滩地）扩种。
    目前全省已压薯藤一百多万亩。季节较早的浙南地区部分县、公社已完成甘薯栽种计划。
    现在，浙江各地正在加紧对套种扩种作物的培育管理。
    本报讯　湖北新洲县千方百计扩大夏种作物面积。
    这个县今年实收小麦面积比去年扩大十万亩左右，这是去年大搞以水利化为中心的治山治湖运动的结果。今年夏种作物面积能不能进一步扩大？经过各级干部和群众讨论，全县作出了“五扩大”的规划，所谓“五扩大”是：第一扩大夏季播种面积；第二扩大晚秋复种面积；第三扩大高产作物；第四扩大油料作物和各种小杂粮面积；第五扩大优良品种的面积。“五扩大”如何实现？主要是发动群众，把一切可以利用的闲散土地都因地制宜地利用起来，真正作到见土就种，见缝插针。经过领导干部深入群众，访问座谈，提出了利用“十边”的措施，就是开垦和利用湖边、江边（这个县沿江滨湖）、堤边、河边、水库边、渠道边、山边、田边、路边和村边等空隙土地，据初步调查摸底，利用“十边”可以播种几万亩夏种作物。为了保证把这些土地都种上，并且种好、管好、保种保收，就要正确和深入地宣传和执行开荒政策，并根据土地集中与分散的不同情况，明确规定：凡是大片荒地由公社或生产队经营（凡生产队有力量经营的，公社应尽量让生产队去经营），小块土地由小队经营，房前屋后的零散土地，则由社员个人经营，以提高生产小队和社员的生产经营积极性。
    利用“十边”进行“五扩大”的具体措施，已经在这个县的各级干部和广大群众中深入人心，并迅速地形成了群众性的行动。除了早稻、中稻、麦茬棉花及其他的杂粮作物，都已经按“五扩大”的规划指标完成播种任务外，现在全县二十万劳动大军，正在有领导有秩序地分班作战。固定一批专班负责小麦脱粒，争取颗粒归仓。另一批班子突击已经种上的秋收作物的田间管理工作。还有一批班子正在继续不懈地大搞“十边”、“五扩大”的抢种任务，采取了“边开荒、边整地，边施肥，边播种”一条鞭的办法，声势十分浩大。广大社员还利用业余时间，在屋前屋后都种上小杂粮和蔬菜，作为家庭副业的一项收入。全县到目前为止，利用“十边”已经扩种了三万七千多亩小杂粮，另有新开出的三万亩荒地，也在准备播种。（附图片）
