This newspaper reports from Zhengzhou on June 3rd: A mass movement to greatly grasp coal, coke, minerals, transportation, and electricity to ensure the great production of steel is developing vigorously throughout Henan Province. The movement is progressing rapidly and achieving remarkable results. The monthly output of pig iron and steel in May both exceeded the production level of April. The average daily output of pig iron in the last ten days of the month increased by more than 15% compared to the average daily output of the previous quarter, and increased by 12% compared to the average daily output of the early and mid-May. Steel and steel products exceeded 15% and 50% respectively, thus opening a victorious prelude to the realization of a new leap forward in steel production throughout the province.

Henan Province's great steel production movement is being carried out under the guiding ideology of taking steel as the key link and vigorously grasping several basic links such as coal, coke, minerals, electricity, and transportation. In various regions, the first secretaries of the prefectural, municipal, and county Party committees took the lead and went deep into the production front lines to direct operations, quickly setting off a "steel guarantee" upsurge of thousands of troops and horses firing in unison. Ji Dengku, the first secretary of the Luoyang Prefectural Party Committee, and responsible persons from relevant units, led seven working groups to seven steel bases, including Guanlin, Sanmenxia, and Mianchi. They organized a one-stop steel guarantee and seizure campaign from mines to coal pits, from railways and highways to short-distance transportation. Forty coal transport wagons were transferred from the regional railway department, and dozens of kilometers of special railway lines were built from the station to the various steel production points, among which the special line from Luoyang Station to Guanlin Steel Plant has been completed. The entire district has established a steel and transportation command, with five dispatch stations under it specifically managing transportation scheduling. The Luoyang Municipal Party Committee instructed large machinery manufacturing enterprises throughout the city, such as Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant, to rush-produce forty small railway wagons to participate in coal, coke, and mineral transportation. In order to strengthen the guarantee of steel production exceeding targets, the Luoyang Prefectural Party Committee mobilized corresponding personnel and launched a four-pronged attack to vigorously develop "small-scale and native" methods. In addition to shifting the focus of mining from mines with inconvenient transportation to mines with convenient transportation, they also opened up one hundred small mines with reserves of thousands to tens of thousands of tons of iron ore in convenient transportation conditions, with the people's communes assisting the highway motorcade in transporting ore to various steel bases. The Yi County Party Secretary personally took charge, transferring one hundred horse-drawn carts to work day and night on the coal and ore transportation lines. Luoyang Steel Plant also established seventy native coke ovens at the Gaoshan Coal Mine, which have already produced more than 1,000 tons of coke to supply the blast furnaces of this plant.

In the fiery battle to guarantee and seize steel, various regions focused on their weakest links and key points of production, concentrating superior forces to break through. In the Xinxiang area, the first secretary of the Prefectural Party Committee served as the commander-in-chief, leading the commissioner, director of the Prefectural Party Committee Office, secretary-general, and director of the Industry Department to form a Steel Office. They also designated the directors of the metallurgy, machinery, coal, transportation, and commerce bureaus to lead the production technology group, equipment matching group, coal transportation group, and material supply group, respectively, strengthening the organizational leadership from top to bottom and overcoming the phenomenon of some links being disconnected that had previously affected steel production. The cities and counties throughout the area also formed five major collaboration zones, each with a Party Committee Secretary in command, enabling the orderly and rapid interweaving of tasks such as ore and coal transportation, metallurgical equipment maintenance, and equipment matching, promoting the steady increase in steel production. The Xinyang Special District focused on both mine transformation and transportation. Currently, vehicle tires and parts have been matched to form complete vehicles. After vigorously carrying out highway maintenance, tens of thousands of tons of ore will be transported down the mountains by June 10th. As a result of innovation in mine blasting, the output of ore has increased sharply, basically balancing the supply and demand relationship between mining and iron smelting. This area also established a power supply command, speeding up the construction of the No. 1 generator unit of the Nan Shui Wan reservoir on the one hand, and vigorously building thermal power plants on the other. While vigorously developing mine construction, Zhengzhou City vigorously grasped transportation, using the method of contract transportation, contract repair, and three unchanged factors of vehicles, personnel, and wages, mobilizing one hundred vehicles from city agencies and enterprises to cooperate with the highway transportation company in coal and ore transportation. The Xuchang Special District vigorously promoted the entire district and the people to run power plants in response to the lack of power, which also powerfully promoted the region's steel production.

In order to fight the key month of the second quarter—June—and continue to seize greater overproduction of steel, the Henan Provincial Party Committee recently convened telephone conferences of prefectural and municipal Party committee secretaries and industry ministers. It called on all localities to further boost their energy on the steel guarantee front, vigorously tap production potential, and seize a greater harvest of steel production in the second quarter. At the same time, a transportation command was formed, adopting measures such as combining native and foreign methods, combining water and land transportation, and combining professional transportation forces with mass transportation forces, strengthening short-distance centralized transportation, and uniformly arranging the transportation of coal, coke, minerals, and iron.

    干部深入第一线集中优势力量猛攻薄弱环节
    河南狠抓煤、矿、运大力保钢
    本报郑州3日电　一个大抓煤、焦、矿、运、电，确保钢铁大生产的群众运动，正在河南全省蓬蓬勃勃的开展。运动进展迅速，成效卓著。5月份生铁和钢的月产量，都超过了4月份的生产水平。下旬生铁平均日产量比上一季度平均日产量又上升了15％以上，和本月上、中旬的日平均产量比较，提高12％，钢和钢材分别超过15％和50％，从而为实现全省钢铁生产新跃进，揭开了胜利的序幕。
    河南省钢铁大生产运动是在以钢为纲，大抓煤、焦、矿、电、运等几个基本环节的指导思想下进行的。各地区在地、市、县各级党委第一书记挂帅、深入生产前线指挥作战中迅速掀起了千军万马、万箭齐发的“保钢”热潮。中共洛阳地委第一书记纪登奎和各有关单位负责人，带领七个工作组，分赴关林、三门峡、渑池等七个钢铁基地，由矿山到煤窑，由铁路、公路到短途运输，组织一条龙保钢夺钢战役，从地区铁路部门抽调运煤车皮四十个，修建由车站到各钢铁生产点的铁路专用线数十公里，其中洛阳站到关林钢铁厂的专用线已经竣工。全区设立了钢铁、运输指挥部，下设五个调度站专管交通调度事宜。洛阳市委指示全市洛阳矿山厂等大型机械制造企业，赶制了小火车皮四十辆，参与煤、焦、矿运输。洛阳地委为了加强保证钢铁大超产的各个环节，动员了相应的人员，四路出兵，大搞“五小洋”，除了将采矿重点由交通不便利的矿点移到交通便利的矿点外，还在运输便利的条件下，新开辟一百个储量千吨到万吨铁矿石的小矿点，由各个人民公社协助公路汽车队向各个钢铁基地运送矿石。宜阳县委书记亲自出马，抽调一百部马车，昼夜不息地奔忙在煤炭、矿石运输线上。洛阳钢铁厂并在高山煤矿建立七十个炼焦土窑，已炼出一千多吨焦炭，供应这个厂的高炉需用。
    在热火朝天的保钢夺钢战斗中，各地区都针对自身最薄弱的环节和生产关键所在，集中优势兵力，加以突破。新乡地区由地委第一书记任总指挥，率领专员、地委办公室主任、秘书长、工业部长等，成立了钢铁办公室，并指定冶金、机械、煤炭、交通运输、商业等各专业局长分别领头组成生产技术组、设备配套组、煤炭运输组、物资供应组，自上而下地加强了组织领导工作，克服了以往因某些环节脱节而影响钢铁生产的现象。全区各市、县还组成了五个大协作区，区区都有党委书记坐镇指挥，使矿石、煤炭运输、冶金设备检修、配套等工作快而井井有条的交错进行，促进钢铁生产稳定上升。信阳专区一手抓矿山改造，一手抓交通运输，目前车辆轮胎、零件已经配套成车，在大搞公路维修后，在6月10日以前，将有数万吨矿石运下山来；由于矿山爆破革新的结果，矿石产量激增，基本上平衡了采矿和炼铁的供求关系。这个地区还成立了供电指挥部，一方面加紧南水湾库一号发电机组的建设，另方面大建火电厂。郑州市在大闹矿山建设的同时，大抓交通运输，用包运包修，和车、人、工资三不变的办法调动全市机关、企业汽车一百部，配合公路运输公司搞煤运矿运，许昌专区针对动力不足状况大搞全区全民办电，也有力地推动了地区钢铁生产。
    为了大战第二季度关键月——6月，继续夺取钢铁更大的超产，中共河南省委近日连续分别召开了地市委书记和工业部长电话会议。号召各地在保钢战线上进一步鼓足干劲，大挖生产潜力，夺取第二季度钢铁生产的更大丰收。同时组成了交通运输指挥部，采取土洋并举、水陆并举、专业运输力量和群众运输力量并举，加强短途集运等措施，统一安排了煤、焦、矿、铁的运输。（附图片）
