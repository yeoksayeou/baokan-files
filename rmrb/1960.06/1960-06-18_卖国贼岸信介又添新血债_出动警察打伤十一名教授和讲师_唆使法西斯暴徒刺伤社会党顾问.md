　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 17th: Following the massacre of demonstrating masses, the traitorous Nobusuke Kishi government of Japan dispatched police on the 16th to brutally beat university professors.

　　According to a statement released on the 16th by Japanese university professors and scholars' groups, at dawn on the 16th, three hundred professors and scholars were on their way to the front of the Diet building to participate in a demonstration rally. However, as they approached the Diet gates, the Nobusuke Kishi government's police suddenly pounced on them, shouting, "Kill them all! Kill them all!" while wielding clubs and other weapons, beating them. As a result, eleven professors and lecturers were seriously injured.

　　The Japanese "National Council to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty" announced on the 16th that, as of the evening of the 16th, in addition to Michiko Kanba's death, two more people were in critical condition and seventy-two others were seriously injured from being beaten by police and violent groups. The "National Council" also announced the circumstances of the savage beating to death of female student Michiko Kanba, who was murdered by the Nobusuke Kishi government's police on the night of the 15th. It said that the autopsy results of Michiko Kanba's body proved that a ruptured pancreas was her fatal injury. Her neck was ruptured in front, her head was smashed, and her body had countless injuries.

　　According to the evening edition of the "Tokyo Shimbun" on the 16th, as of 10:00 a.m. that day, one hundred and seventy-four students had been arrested by the police.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 17th: Japan Socialist Party member of the House of Representatives and advisor Jotaro Kawakami was suddenly stabbed in the shoulder by a Fascist thug with a knife at six o'clock this evening, suffering serious injuries. At the time, Kawakami was giving a speech to demonstrators gathered near the House of Councillors. When the assailant tried to stab a second time, nearby Socialist Party members wrestled him to the ground, confiscated his knife, and handed him over to the police.

　　This is yet another attack by the Nobusuke Kishi government, instigating Fascist thugs against the people who are engaged in the anti-American and anti-Kishi patriotic struggle.

　　Kawakami was immediately taken to the hospital for treatment after being stabbed.
