Xinhua News Agency, June 21st, Washington Dispatch: Assistant Secretary of State for Latin American Affairs Rubottom, speaking before the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Cuban Revolution and the national democratic movements in other Latin American countries on the 20th, deliberately fabricated the claim that "international communism is using Cuba as an example to promote similar revolutions south of [America's] borders." He then brandished the new "Monroe Doctrine" club, clamoring that the United States is "determined" to keep the entire Western Hemisphere free from so-called "foreign aggression."

Rubottom made the above remarks as the United States intensifies its planning of new conspiracies to interfere with Cuba in multiple ways. According to a report by United Press International on the 17th, citing Washington diplomatic sources, the US government is preparing to submit to the Organization of American States' Inter-American Peace Committee "a large number of diplomatic charges against Cuba" in order to use this American-controlled organization to invade Cuba. According to these sources, "this matter may be raised next month." Among the "charges" against Cuba that the United States is preparing to submit to the Organization of American States are "accusations that the Castro regime took over American property in Cuba without providing compensation," even though the Cuban revolutionary government has refuted this accusation.

Prior to this, former US Ambassador to Cuba Smith, in a conversation with the "Miami Herald," had incited the Organization of American States to "send its own troops" under the guise of "supervising free elections" to carry out armed intervention in Cuba.

In addition to attempting to interfere in Cuba through the Organization of American States, the United States is also continuing to enlist Cuban counter-revolutionaries, plotting to use them as vanguards for subverting the Cuban revolutionary government. According to the "New York Times" on June 10th, five key counter-revolutionary figures, including former Prime Minister Antonio Varona, under the protection of the United States, have established a so-called "Revolutionary Front" in Miami, USA, and are carrying out activities against the Cuban revolution. As is well known, Miami, which is teeming with all kinds of Cuban counter-revolutionary elements, has long been a dark city of anti-Cuban conspiracies on American territory.

In order to create "public opinion" for new conspiracies to further interfere in Cuba, in recent days, members of the United States Congress have been particularly blatant in stirring up a clamor for intervention in Cuba. US House Foreign Affairs Committee member Leonard Farbstein and Judiciary Committee Chairman Emanuel Celler launched a brutal attack on the Cuban revolution in a television broadcast on the 19th. Farbstein also suggested that the US State Department announce the severance of diplomatic relations with Cuba and the cessation of purchases of Cuban sugar. Prior to this, US Congressman Daniel Flood publicly clamored at a meeting of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the 17th that "Congress should take action, invoking the principles of the Monroe Doctrine" to deal with Cuba. Another Congressman, Charles Bennett, advocated that the United States subvert the revolutionary government unanimously supported by the Cuban people under the pretext of so-called "helping" Cuba hold "free elections."

According to Reuters, Flood and Bennett also issued these frenzied calls for intervention in Cuba while releasing the smokescreen of "freeing Cuba from their so-called Soviet control." On the same day, US Senate Democratic Leader Lyndon Johnson clamored in the Senate that "the United States must consider how we will deal with the increasingly close cooperation between the Soviets and the Cuban government."

    美国加紧策划武装侵略古巴
    企图利用美国控制的美洲国家组织作侵略工具
    继续网罗古巴反革命分子充当颠复古巴急先锋
    新华社21日讯　华盛顿消息：美国负责拉丁美洲事务的助理国务卿鲁博特姆20日在众议院外交小组委员会会议上谈到古巴革命和其它拉丁美洲国家的民族民主运动时，故意捏造说：“国际共产主义利用古巴作为榜样，正在（美国的）疆界以南鼓吹类似的革命。”他就此挥舞新的“门罗主义”的大棒，叫嚷美国已经“下定决心”，要使整个西半球不受所谓“外来的侵略”。
    鲁博特姆是在美国加紧策划多方面对古巴进行干涉的新阴谋的情况下发表上述讲话的。据合众国际社17日援引华盛顿外交人士的话透露，美国政府正在准备向美洲国家组织所属的美洲国家和平委员会
  “提出告发古巴的一大批外交罪状”，以便通过这个由美国控制的组织来侵略古巴。据这些人士说，“这件事可能在下月就提出”。在美国准备向美洲国家组织提出的古巴的
  “罪状”中，还包括“指责卡斯特罗政权接管美国在古巴的财产而不给予赔偿”，尽管古巴革命政府已经驳斥了这种指责。
    在这以前，前美国驻古巴大使史密斯对“迈阿密先驱报”发表谈话时，曾经鼓动由美洲国家组织“派出自己的军队”，在所谓“监督举行自由选举”的烟幕下来武装干涉古巴。
    除了企图通过美洲国家组织干涉古巴以外，美国还在继续网罗古巴的反革命分子，阴谋利用他们来充当颠复古巴革命政府的急先锋。据“纽约时报”6月10日透露，包括前总理安东尼奥·巴罗纳在内的五名反革命首要分子在美国的庇护下，已经在美国的迈阿密成立一个所谓“革命阵线”，并且正在展开反对古巴革命的活动。如所周知，麕集着形形色色古巴反革命分子的迈阿密早已成为美国领土上反古巴阴谋的黑城。
    为了替进一步干涉古巴的新阴谋制造“舆论”，最近几天来，美国国会议员们特别嚣张地掀起一片干涉古巴的叫嚷。美国众议院外交委员会委员伦纳德·法布斯坦和司法委员会主席伊曼纽尔·塞勒19日在电视广播中对古巴革命进行了粗暴的攻击。法布斯坦还建议美国国务院宣布同古巴断绝外交关系和停止购买古巴食糖。在这以前，美国众议员丹尼尔·弗勒德17日在众议院外交小组委员会的会议上，曾经公然叫嚷“国会应该采取行动，援用门罗主义的原则”来对付古巴。另一名众议员查尔斯·贝奈特则鼓动由美国在所谓“帮助”古巴举行
  “自由选举”的借口下，颠复古巴人民所一致支持的革命政府。
    据路透社报道，弗勒德和贝奈特也都是在放出“使古巴摆脱他们所谓的苏联的控制”的烟幕下，发出干涉古巴的狂热叫嚣的。同一天，美国参议院民主党领袖林登·约翰逊则在参议院中叫嚷，“美国必须考虑，我们将如何对付苏联人同古巴政府之间的日益紧密的合作。”
