What We Saw on the Production Front Line
By our reporters Xu Bingzhong and Shao Quan

On the morning of June 13th, we arrived at the Muchengjian Coal Mine in western Beijing. Here, the miners were full of energy, busily working, presenting a tense and enthusiastic fighting atmosphere. However, the office building was quite quiet. Leading cadres and office staff had all gone deep into the production front line, into the mine.

Small Problems, Big Key
Down in the mine, we ran into Deputy Mine Director An Bulu, who was considering a new problem: the existing working face was about to run out of raw coal, but the rock excavation speed had not increased accordingly. The main target of the deputy mine director's deep dive into the front line was excavation.

In the excavation team, several pneumatic drills were roaring. The drillers would stop from time to time to fiddle with the switches, testing the wind force. An Bulu took a pneumatic drill from a worker's hand and found that some screws were loose and tied with wire; the air pipe was leaking, and the wind force was weak. The workers said, "We have large parts, but small parts are temporarily unavailable." An Bulu thought to himself, the excavation speed can't be increased, the problem lies here. Although the parts are small, the impact is great. A "small problem" is a big key! After clarifying the situation, he immediately left the mine and went to the electromechanical repair workshop.

It turned out that the electromechanical repair workshop had been focusing on producing large spare parts, but had neglected the manufacturing of small parts. An Bulu immediately decided to transfer a small lathe and two workers to specialize in the production of small parts. Three days later, all six pneumatic drills working with "illnesses" were repaired. The daily rock footage of the entire mine immediately increased from eight meters to more than fourteen meters.

Like An Bulu, more than 30 leading cadres in this mine went deep into the field to solve specific problems. The chief engineer and the chairman of the trade union led working groups to help workers summarize and promote the operating experience of the new coal mining method. The transportation section chief went down the mine to inspect the electric train tracks and organized manpower to repair 30 unqualified places. In this way, the entire mine won a large-area high yield, completing the state plan for the 1st to 14th exceeding 12.4%. And on June 3rd, they completed half of the annual state plan ahead of schedule.

You Have to Cook Before You Can Eat
In the roadway of the 17th coal extraction team, squad leader Gao Fengyou was deploying the day's tasks to the miners. Some were going to drill holes, some to transport materials, some to release coal, ... In the end, a new worker was left without an assignment, who was the mine's deputy chief engineer, Zhao Yuxiang. Gao Fengyou looked at the deputy chief engineer and was about to ask him to do some light work - guarding the coal leakage point. At this time, Zhao Yuxiang spoke first:

"Master Gao, shouldn't we send a few people to excavate the west slope roadway?"

"We don't have enough people today, let's talk about it later!" Gao Fengyou casually agreed.

"The coal here will be mined in a few days. If we don't excavate the roadway now, a new coal mining working face won't be prepared in the future, and it won't be able to take over, which will affect production. We have to look ahead!" Zhao Yuxiang thought of the Party committee secretary's words, improving production management and organizing the handover of working faces were important keys to winning high yields in June, so he unhesitatingly made a suggestion to Gao Fengyou.

Gao Fengyou originally wanted to produce more coal and didn't plan to allocate manpower to excavate the roadway. After Zhao Yuxiang said this, he went to the west slope roadway to inspect.

Zhao Yuxiang found the two cadres who came with him and also came to the west slope roadway. He said to Gao Fengyou, "You don't have enough people, let's take over this work, the three of us." As he spoke, he started working. They worked continuously for six hours and excavated more than one meter.

This incident deeply moved Gao Fengyou. Afterwards, he inspected his one-sided thinking of only focusing on producing more coal in his own shift and neglecting production preparation work to the Party branch. With the help of the Party branch, he and the three shifts jointly formulated a progress chart for coal mining and excavation. He said, "We can't just eat, we have to cook first." This sentence has now become a common saying among the workers of the three shifts.

"Close the Door to Prevent Thieves"
Party Committee Secretary Zhao Wenhuan had just solved a key production problem at one site and rushed to another site. Like a housekeeper, he cared about every worker, and cared about every nail and wood in the roadway. He carefully looked at the ceiling, observed every support, and thought to himself: "This year, the entire mine has not had any serious injuries, and minor injuries have also been greatly reduced. Now it is another high-yield battle, and everyone is looking forward to producing more coal. At such a time, it is easiest to become numb and neglect safety. As leaders, we must be especially clear-headed..."

As he thought, he walked to a section of the fifth team. This team is the mine's safety pacesetter. For more than two years, not even a minor injury accident had occurred. Not long ago, under the personal leadership of Zhao Wenhuan, this team successfully promoted the "three-no working face" new coal mining method. Since June, the team's daily coal output has increased from about 800 tons to more than 1,000 tons. Zhao Wenhuan saw that the supports in the roadway were neatly arranged, and secretly praised them. At this time, he turned into an inconspicuous side alley. A new worker, Ma Ertie, was smashing large pieces of coal. Not far from him, a large stone resting on two supports protruded from the middle of the supports. Zhao Wenhuan saw it at a glance.

"Ertie! Is this stone safe?"

Ertie stood up, looked at it, and replied, "Not safe."

"Why wasn't it discovered during the inspection?"

"Sigh! We were negligent." Squad leader Hao Shanfang walked over, carefully checked it again, and said embarrassedly:

"It would be too late to deal with it after something happened! We can't wait for the thief to run away before closing the door!" After Zhao Wenhuan finished speaking, he went to inspect other teams. He knew that he didn't need to say much. As long as he pointed it out, the workers would know what to do.

When he came back again, a thick wooden beam had indeed been erected under the stone. Secretary Zhao's "close the door to prevent thieves" thinking quickly spread among the workers.

Joint Office Work
After the leading cadres went down the mine, the number of office staff significantly decreased. However, production management work has been strengthened. In the past, the production report for the first ten days of each month would not be sent out until the 13th, but the report for the first ten days of June was delivered to Party Committee Secretary Zhao Wenhuan on the 11th. When the section cadres reported the ten-day indicators to the Mining Bureau office at eleven o'clock in the morning, the comrades in the bureau were both happy and surprised. They called and asked, "Why did you report so quickly this time?"

It turned out that while the leading cadres were on the front lines, the section cadres also studied the issue of improving management work under the new situation. The cadres of the six sections of planning, dispatching, wages, materials, and accounting, put forward the slogan of "finish a day's work in half a day, and work on the front line for half a day", and decided to hold joint office work every month on the 1st and 6th, to jointly formulate work plans, conduct economic activity analysis, and create ten-day and monthly reports, ... In order to concentrate everyone's wisdom, improve work efficiency and management level, and better help the leadership organize production.

June 11th was the first joint office day. The long table in the conference room was full of people. Sixteen cadres from six sections, with materials and computers, gathered together to rush to make the report for the first ten days. Some were calculating, some were checking numbers, some were mimeographing, and some were busy with the final process of binding the reports into volumes. The planning section and the material section were originally more than a mile apart. Every month at this time, the statisticians of the two sections would frequently make phone calls, sometimes reporting the wrong numbers on the phone, sometimes the phone couldn't get through, and they had to run errands. Now, they sit together, and asking for a number, a word, a reach solves the problem. Within four hours, three thousand and fifty-eight ten-day report numbers were accurately calculated and filled in. Under the new Great Leap Forward situation, the section work has also become a "one-stop shop".

    生产第一线见闻
    本报记者　徐炳忠　邵泉
      6月13日清晨，我们来到了京西木城涧煤矿。这里矿工们精神抖擞，往来忙碌，呈现一片紧张而热烈的战斗气氛。可是，办公大楼里却显得相当宁静。领导干部和科室人员，都深入生产第一线到井下去了。小问题　大关键
    来到井下，碰上了副矿长安步闾，他正在考虑一个新的问题：现有工作面上的原煤很快就要采完了，但是岩石掘进速度还没有相应的提高。副矿长深入第一线的主攻目标就是掘进。
    在掘进队，几部风钻发出达达的吼叫声，钻工们不时停下来搬弄着开关，试量风力的大小。安步闾从工人手中接过风钻，发现有的螺丝松了，用铁丝绑着；风管漏风，风力很弱。工人们说：“大零件倒有，小零件一时却领不到。”安步闾心想，掘进速度提不高，原来问题就出在这里，零件虽小，影响却大，“小问题”是个大关键啊！他问明了情况以后，马上就走出矿井，到机电修理车间去了。
    原来，机电修理车间注意了生产大型备件，却忽略了小零件的制造。安步闾立即决定抽调一台小车床和两名工人，专门负责小零件的生产。三天以后，六部带“病”工作的风钻都修好了。全矿每天岩石进尺，立即由八米提高到十四米以上。
    像安步闾一样，这个矿的三十多名领导干部，都深入现场具体解决问题。总工程师、工会主席分别带领工作小组，帮助工人总结推广新采煤法的操作经验，运输段长到井下检查电车轨道，组织人力把三十处不合格的地方修好。就这样，全矿夺得了大面积高产，1至14日超额12．4％完成了国家计划。并且在6月3日，提前完成了全年国家计划的一半。
    要吃饭得先做饭
    回采十七组的巷道里，班长高凤友正在给矿工们部署一天的任务。有的去钻眼，有的去运料，有的去放煤，……最后剩下一名新来的工人没有分配工作，他是矿里的副总工程师赵玉祥。高凤友看了看副总工程师，正想让他去干点轻微活——照管漏煤眼。这时，赵玉祥却先开了口：
    “高师傅，西坡巷道得派几个人去掘进吧？”
    “今天人不多，以后再说吧！”高凤友随口应承着。
    “这里的煤还有几天就采完了，要是现在不掘进巷道，以后新的采煤工作面准备不出来，接替不上，生产就会受到影响。咱们得走一步看两步才行呀！”赵玉祥想到党委书记的话，改进生产管理，组织好工作面的接替，是夺取6月高产的重要关键，于是就毫不迟疑地对高凤友提出了建议。
    高凤友本来一心想多出煤，不打算分出人力去掘进巷道。经赵玉祥一说，就走到西坡巷道察看去了。
    赵玉祥找到同来的两名干部，也来到了西坡巷道。他对高凤友说：“你的人不够，我们三个人包了这活吧。”说着就动手干起来，他们一连工作了六小时，掘进了一米多。
    这件事使高凤友深为感动。事后，他向党支部检查了自己只顾本班多出煤、忽视生产准备工作的片面思想。在党支部的帮助下，他和三班共同制订了采煤与掘进的进度图表。他说：“咱们不能光吃饭，还得先做饭。”这句话，现在成了三班工人的口头禅了。
    “关门防贼”
    党委书记赵文焕刚刚在一个现场解决了生产关键，又急忙地赶到另一个现场。他像一个管家人一样，关心着每一个工人，关心着巷道里的一钉一木。他仔细地打量着顶棚，观察着每一根支柱，心里想：“今年全矿没出过重伤事故，轻伤也大大减少。眼前又是高产战斗，大家都盼着多出煤，在这样的时刻，最容易麻痹大意，忽视安全。当领导的，头脑可要特别清醒。……”
    他一边想，一边走，来到了一段五组。这个小组是全矿的安全标兵，两年多来，连个轻伤事故也没发生过。不久以前，这个小组在赵文焕亲自领导下，成功地推行了“三无工作面”新采煤法，6月份以来，全组每天产煤量从八百吨左右提高到一千吨以上。赵文焕看见巷道里支柱架得整整齐齐，心里暗暗夸奖。这时，他拐进一条不为人注意的支巷里来。新工人马二铁正在砸碎大块煤，在他身边不远的地方，一块搭在两根支架上的大石头，从支架当中露出了头，赵文焕一眼就看到了。
    “二铁！这块石头，安全吗？”
    二铁站起来看了看回答说：“不安全”。
    “为什么验收时没发现呢？”
    “咳！我们疏忽了。”班长郝善方走过来，仔细检查了一遍，不好意思地说：
    “要是出了事再处理可就晚啦！咱们不能等贼跑了再关门呀！”赵文焕说完，就往别组检查去了。他知道不用多讲，只要一点明，工人们就知道自己该怎么办。
    当他再回来的时候，石头下面，果然已经架上了一根粗大的木梁。赵书记“关门防贼”的思想，在工人中就很快传播开来了。
    联合办公
    领导干部下井以后，办公室的人员显著减少。可是，生产管理工作反而加强了。往常，每月上旬的生产表报，要到13日才能报出去，而6月上旬的表报，在11日就送到了党委书记赵文焕的手里。当科室干部在早晨十一点钟把旬报指标报到矿务局办公室的时候，局里的同志又高兴又奇怪。他们打电话来问：“你们这次怎么报得这样快？”
    原来，在领导干部亲临前线的同时，科室干部也研究了在新形势下改进管理工作的问题。计划、调度、工资、材料、会计等六个科室的干部，提出了“一天工作半天完、半天工作在前线”的口号，决定每月逢一逢六，举行联合办公，共同制订作业计划，进行经济活动分析，制作旬和月的报表，……以便集中大家的智慧，提高工作效率和管理水平，更好地帮助领导上组织生产。
    6月11日，是第一个联合办公日，会议室的长桌子周围，坐满了人。六个科室的十六个干部，带着资料和计算机，集中到一起赶制上旬的报表。有的进行计算，有的核对数字，有的刻版油印，有的忙最后一道工序，把表报装订成册。计划科和材料科原来相隔一里多路。每月到这个时候，两科的统计人员，早就频繁地打起电话来，有时电话里报错了数字，有时电话打不通，还得跑路。现在，他们坐在一块，要个数字，一句话、一伸手就解决了问题。四个小时之内，三千零五十八个旬报数字，都准确地计算填报出来。在新的大跃进形势下，科室工作也变成“一条龙”了。（附图片）
