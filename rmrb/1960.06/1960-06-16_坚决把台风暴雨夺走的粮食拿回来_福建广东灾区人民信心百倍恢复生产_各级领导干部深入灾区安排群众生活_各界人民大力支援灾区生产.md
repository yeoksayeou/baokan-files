Xinhua News Agency report: A massive production campaign of "ensuring increased production in severely affected areas, ensuring good harvests in lightly affected areas, and striving for overproduction in unaffected areas" is vigorously unfolding in Fujian. Having overcome the typhoons and rainstorms, the people of Fujian are determined to use the soaring spirit of "recovering ten times what was lost by one point" to regain the losses from the disaster and ensure a bumper summer harvest.

The typhoon and rainstorm attack caused significant losses to Fujian Province. Major rivers and low-lying areas experienced extensive flooding. Some early rice, which was heading and flowering, will suffer reduced production or crop failure due to the flooding. After the disaster, the CPC Fujian Provincial Committee and Party committees at all levels, while vigorously rushing to rescue and resettle residents of flooded villages, dispatched more than 100,000 cadres to go deep into the fields to lead the disaster-stricken areas in production self-relief and the non-disaster areas in overproduction campaigns.

Fujian Province's industrial, commercial, transportation, medical, and health departments are also fully supporting the disaster areas in restoring production and arranging people's lives. On June 12th alone, the Fuzhou industrial departments transported more than 120 tons of supplies to various disaster areas. The departments and communes in the Nanping Special Zone rushed to transport 100,000 mao bamboo poles, timber, and 40,000 dan of firewood in one day to support the coastal disaster areas. The Provincial Coal and Iron Headquarters and the Transportation Headquarters also rushed to transport more than 10,000 tons of coal from inside and outside the province to support the restoration of production in disaster-stricken towns.

While rushing to allocate and transport supplies, various departments have dispatched large numbers of cadres and medical personnel to the disaster areas to help residents arrange production and life. In addition to transferring hundreds of boxes of medicines and equipment to support the disaster areas, the medical and health departments of Fuzhou, Jinjiang, and other places have also dispatched more than 600 medical personnel to the disaster areas to carry out epidemic prevention and health work.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 15th: Under the leadership of the Party, the people of Shantou and Foshan Special Zones in Guangdong Province, after fighting against typhoons, rainstorms, and floods, have plunged into a new battle of restoring production with high morale and redoubled efforts, determined to recover all the losses caused by typhoons and floods, and even exceed them significantly. Now that the typhoons and rainstorms have passed, and the floods have begun to recede, the flood control struggle has achieved a great victory.

At present, a massive upsurge in production recovery is taking place in the disaster-stricken counties. To help the people in the disaster areas overcome difficulties, the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee has promptly allocated 6 million yuan in relief funds and a large amount of grain, seeds, and other materials to support the disaster areas. Guangdong Provincial Health Department has also organized a large number of medical and health personnel to go to the affected areas to carry out post-disaster medical work and lead the masses in carrying out environmental sanitation work, and allocated a large number of drugs to support the disaster areas, to protect the health of the people in the disaster areas. The Provincial Party Committee, the Provincial People's Committee, and the Shantou and Foshan Prefectural Party Committees and Administrative Offices jointly organized two condolence groups, led by Lin Qiangyun and Wei Jinfei, members of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and Vice Governors respectively, to visit the Shantou and Foshan Special Zones, which were severely affected by the disaster.

Cadres at all levels have also gone deep into the disaster areas, eating, living, working, and discussing with the masses, arranging people's lives, and leading the restoration of production. With the care and support of the Party, the people in the disaster areas have plunged into a new battle of restoring production with high morale and redoubled efforts. In Lufeng County, more than 150,000 people are mobilized every day to carry out production recovery and reconstruction of their homes. In the past two days alone, they have drained waterlogged fields and washed seedlings on more than 40,000 mu, rescued more than 29,000 mu of sweet potatoes, replanted more than 500 mu of rice seedlings, and harvested more than 3,000 mu of ripe rice and sweet potatoes and more than 3,900 mu of miscellaneous grains. Party and government cadres and commune leaders in Haifeng County have all gone deep into the most difficult places, sharing weal and woe with the masses, which has greatly inspired the masses. In the past two days, more than 120,000 people have been mobilized throughout the county to work hard to remove standing water, wash and replant seedlings, topdress and cultivate soil, and repair dikes and fill breaches. The people of Chao'an, Chenghai, and Shantou, three counties and cities that have just overcome the largest flood peak in the history of the Han River, have also transferred part of the labor force from the flood control front to prepare for summer harvesting and planting from yesterday, while the locally affected areas are making every effort to repair dikes and close breaches. The people of Huiyang County, who overcame the extraordinary flood in the Dongjiang River last year, put forward "no reduction in production in severely affected areas, increased production in lightly affected areas, and a bumper harvest in non-disaster areas." The people of the whole county are exerting even greater efforts than last year, vowing to recover everything taken away by typhoons and floods. All communes in the county are classifying the rice crops affected by flooding and wind damage according to the growth stage of the seedlings, and taking different measures to rescue them. For late-transplanted rice crops that are in the late tillering stage and the round stem elongation stage, additional topdressing is applied; for rice crops that have already conceived and are heading and flowering, foliar fertilization is adopted to promote grain filling and protect the panicles.

    坚决把台风暴雨夺走的粮食拿回来
    福建广东灾区人民信心百倍恢复生产
    各级领导干部深入灾区安排群众生活　各界人民大力支援灾区生产
    据新华社讯　一个声势浩大的“重灾保增产，轻灾保丰收，无灾争超产”的大生产运动正在福建各地蓬勃开展。战胜了台风暴雨的福建人民决心用“损失一分，夺回十分”的冲天干劲，夺回灾害损失，确保夏季大丰收。
    这次台风暴雨的袭击，给福建省带来了重大损失，各江河流域低洼地区大都发生内涝灾害，有些正在抽穗扬花的早稻将因受淹减产或失收。灾情发生后，中共福建省委和各级党委在大力突击抢救和安置受淹村庄居民同时，就抽派十多万名干部深入田间，领导受灾地区的生产自救运动和非灾区的超产运动。
    福建省工业、商业、交通运输和医药卫生等各部门也全力支援灾区人民恢复生产，安排生活。福州市工业部门12日一天运往各灾区的物资，即达一百二十多吨。南平专区各部门和公社在一天中赶运了十万根毛竹、木材和四万担柴火，支援沿海灾区。省煤铁指挥部和运输指挥部也从省内外赶运一万多吨煤炭，支援灾区城镇恢复生产。
    在赶调和赶运物资的同时，各部门都派出大批干部和医务人员，到灾区帮助居民安排生产和生活。福州、晋江等地医药卫生部门除了调运几百箱药品、器材支援灾区以外，还派出六百多个医疗人员前往灾区，开展防疫卫生工作。
    据新华社广州15日电　广东省汕头、佛山专区人民在党的领导下，在抗击了台风、暴雨和洪水的袭击后，又斗志昂扬、干劲百倍地投入了恢复生产的新战斗，决心把台风、洪水所造成的损失全部夺回来，并且要大大超过。现在，台风暴雨已经过去，洪水也开始退泄，抗洪斗争已经取得了巨大的胜利。
    目前，灾区各县正在掀起一个声势浩大的恢复生产的高潮。为了帮助灾区人民克服困难，中共广东省委已及时拨出六百万元救济款和大批粮食、种子以及其他物资，支援灾区。广东省卫生部门也组织了大批医药卫生人员到受灾地区，进行灾后医疗工作和领导群众开展环境卫生工作，并调拨大批药物支援灾区，以保障灾区群众的健康。省委、省人民委员会，汕头、佛山地委和专署共同组织两个慰问团，分别由省委常委、副省长林锵云、魏今非率领前往灾情较重的汕头、佛山专区进行慰问。
    各级干部也都深入到灾区，与群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，安排群众生活，领导恢复生产。灾区人民在党的关怀和支持下，斗志昂扬、干劲百倍地投入了恢复生产的新战斗。陆丰县每天都出动十五万多人进行恢复生产、重建家园的工作。仅在最近两天内，就排涝洗禾四万多亩，抢救甘薯二万九千多亩，补播秧苗五百多亩；抢收已熟的水稻、甘薯三千多亩，杂粮三千九百多亩。海丰县的党政干部和公社的领导干部全部深入到最艰苦的地方，和群众同甘共苦，对群众的鼓舞很大，两天来，全县就出动了十二万多人，大闹除积水，洗苗补苗，追肥培土，修堤填决。刚刚战胜韩江历史上最大洪峰的潮安、澄海、汕头三个县市的人民，也从昨天起在抗洪前线上调回一部分劳动力，投入夏收夏种的准备工作，局部受灾地区则在全力进行复堤堵口。去年曾经战胜东江特大洪水的惠阳县人民提出“重灾区不减产，轻灾区要增产，非灾区要大丰收”，全县人民发挥比去年更大的干劲，誓把台风、洪水抢去的全部夺回来。全县各公社对被淹和受风灾的稻禾，都按禾苗的生长期进行排队，并采取不同的措施进行抢救。对正在分蘖后期和圆身拔节的迟插稻禾，加施追肥；对于已经含胎和扬花吐穗的稻禾，采取根外施肥的办法，攻粒保穗。
