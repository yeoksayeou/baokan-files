Colorful slogans were posted everywhere on the walls, welcoming the envoys of the fraternal Albanian people to visit. When Chairman Lleshi and other distinguished guests arrived at the edge of Fanjia Village by car, male and female commune members lined the streets to welcome them, shouting slogans: "Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Albanian people!"

Fanjia Village, known as the "Ten Mile Fragrant Flower," is a famous flower production area in Beijing. Today, commune members picked the most beautiful peonies, roses, and magnolia flowers to present to Chairman Lleshi and other distinguished guests, including Belishova, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party. After accepting a flower offering, Belishova said happily: "What beautiful flowers, just like the friendship between our two peoples."

The distinguished guests visited the commune's internal combustion engine repair factory, agricultural machinery repair and manufacturing factory, and visited the mechanized farming team, gardening team, kindergarten and commune members' families. Wherever the distinguished guests went, there was a burst of warm applause. During the visit, the distinguished guests inquired caringly about the commune's production and construction and the living conditions of the commune members, and praised the commune members for their high enthusiasm, the good operation of the commune's factories, the rapid development of water conservancy construction and mechanized farming production, and the healthy growth of the children. Chairman Lleshi and Comrade Belishova visited the home of commune member Zhang Qingquan, who used to be a poor peasant, and talked with Zhang Qingquan's seventy-year-old father, Zhang Zihe, and fifteen-year-old son, Zhang Lihua. Chairman Lleshi presented Zhang Lihua with a commemorative medal. Belishova told the old man Zhang Zihe: "The friendship between the Albanian and Chinese people is developing day by day." During the time the distinguished guests stayed in the commune, the village was filled with an atmosphere of friendship between the Chinese and Albanian people from beginning to end.

    黄土岗中匈友好人民公社办公室所在地樊家村，今天十分热闹。墙壁上到处张贴彩色标语，欢迎兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民的使者来参观。当列希主席等贵宾乘车到达樊家村村边时，男女社员们夹道欢迎，高呼口号：“中阿两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！”“以苏联为首的社会主义阵营团结万岁！”这时，锣鼓齐鸣，鞭炮连响，公社乐队吹奏阿尔巴尼亚民歌“含苞欲放的花”。被称为“十里花香”的樊家村是北京著名花卉产地，今天社员们采来最鲜艳的芍药、月季、玉兰花，献给列希主席和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员贝利绍娃等贵宾。贝利绍娃在接受一次献花以后，高兴地说：“多么鲜艳的花，就像我们两国人民的友谊一样。”

    贵宾们在这里参观了公社办的内燃机修配厂、农业机械修造厂，访问了机耕队、园艺队、幼儿园和社员家庭等。贵宾们走到哪里，哪里便响起一阵阵热烈的欢迎掌声。在参观中，贵宾们关怀地询问了许多关于公社生产建设和社员生活的情况，并且赞许社员的积极性高，公社工厂办得好，水利建设和机耕生产发展快，孩子们长得挺健康。列希主席、贝利绍娃同志访问了过去是贫农的社员张清泉的家庭，同张清泉的七十岁的父亲张子和和十五岁的儿子张利华谈了话。列希主席送给张利华一枚纪念章。贝利绍娃告诉张子和老人说：“阿尔巴尼亚人民和中国人民的友谊正在日益发展。”贵宾们在公社逗留的时刻里，村庄上自始至终洋溢着中阿两国人民友谊的气氛。
