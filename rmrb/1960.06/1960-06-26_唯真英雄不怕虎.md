Only True Heroes Fear No Tigers
Zheng Ge
	Back then, on Jingyang Ridge, a fierce tiger hurt people, causing anxiety among passing merchants, and everyone feared Jingyang Ridge. Only Wu Song was unafraid, dared to fight the tiger, and killed the "big worm with hanging eyes and white forehead." This proved that tigers can be fought and can be killed. Wu Song, who killed the real tiger, is forever praised by the people as a hero.

	Dealing with the outwardly strong but inwardly weak American imperialism is the same.

	In 1946, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. It looks like the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality, they don't have much strength." The Chinese people, according to the truth pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong, adopted a policy of resolute blows and unwavering determination against imperialism and domestic reactionaries. They defeated Japanese imperialism, defeated Chiang Kai-shek's eight million troops, and defeated the American imperialist aggression. The struggle to resist America and aid Korea exposed the true nature of American imperialism as a paper tiger. At that time, American imperialism was very strong and tyrannical. It had a large amount of steel, a large amount of military equipment, and gathered the armies of more than a dozen vassal states, thinking it was invincible. However, the Chinese and Korean people were heroes who were not afraid of tigers, dared to fight tigers, and after three years of competition, exposed the true face of this enemy: just a paper tiger!

	More and more people in the world have gradually understood this truth from their own actual lives and struggles. If you are polite and compromise with imperialism and its running dogs, and "actively coexist," the result will be to fall into their trap, bind your own hands and feet, and be led by the nose; if you fight them resolutely, then the more you fight, the stronger you become, turning the imperialist trap into a noose around their own necks. In the end, you will break the superstition of imperialism and expose the original face of these paper tigers.

	Isn't the anti-American storm of the Asian people once again clearly proving this truth? Syngman Rhee, Menderes, Nobusuke Kishi, riding on the heads of the people, flaunting their power, "were once heroes of their time, but where are they now!" American imperialism and its running dogs, with no shortage of money, no lack of strong military equipment, and meticulous plans, however, under the iron fists of the South Korean people, the Turkish people, and the Japanese people, their ending is only failure, failure, and more failure. Why? It is because the people are no longer lambs to be slaughtered, but have been tempered into heroes who are not afraid of tigers in the struggle!

	Heroes who are not afraid of tigers, even if they are unarmed, will engage in resolute fighting. Didn't Wu Song break his club and kill the fierce tiger on Jingyang Ridge with his bare hands? Conversely, even if weapons are sophisticated and material resources are abundant, if you are timid and dare not fight, the result will definitely be self-defeating.

	Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out long ago: "In front of beasts, you must not show the slightest timidity. We must learn from Wu Song on Jingyang Ridge. In Wu Song's view, the tiger on Jingyang Ridge, whether you provoke it or not, it will eat you anyway. Either kill the tiger, or be eaten by the tiger, one of the two must happen." ("On the People's Democratic Dictatorship")

	Let us learn from the heroic Cuban people. Compared to many countries, Cuba has a small population, a small land area, an underdeveloped economy, and it is right next to the tiger. From Florida in the United States to Cuba is only half an hour away. However, look at the heroic spirit of the Cuban people in resisting American imperialist aggression! The United States says: If you don't listen, we will stop your "aid"! Cuba says: Take back your hypocritical "aid," we don't care! When the United States sends planes to make trouble, the Cuban people shoot them down. When the United States sends agents to sabotage, the Cuban people suppress them. Raúl Castro, the Minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Cuba, said well: Cuba's struggle shattered the myth that imperialism is invincible. He said: History proves that American imperialism is an eagle with plucked feathers, and its claws are injured by plundering the people of Latin American countries. It has been flying lower and lower, and one day it will fall to the ground and crawl.

	Such heroes who are not afraid of tigers are increasing in Japan, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Just as Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out to the delegation of Japanese writers: "The Japanese people's victorious struggle against American imperialism and its agents in Japan, demanding national independence and democratic freedom, is a great support for the Chinese people and the people of the world in their struggle against American imperialist aggression and in defense of world peace." The people of the world always encourage and support each other in the battle of fighting tigers.

	Only true heroes fear no tigers! Those who dare not fight tigers either do not have enough understanding of the tiger's nature, or still have some unrealistic fantasies of seeking cooperation with the tiger. In short, they are a little "afraid." These people should wake up quickly and know that no matter what era it is, tigers always eat people. In Wu Song's time, it was necessary to fight tigers, and in the 1960s, it is still necessary to fight tigers. This principle will never be "outdated." As for those modern revisionists who play the role of accomplices, deceiving people to feed the tigers, they are even more hateful and shameless.

    唯真英雄不怕虎
    郑歌
    当年景阳冈上猛虎伤人，闹得过往客商不安，人人怕过景阳冈。独有武松不怕，敢于打虎，把“吊睛白额的大虫”打死。证明老虎是能够打、而且能够打死的。打死真老虎的武松永远被人民传颂为英雄。
    对付外强中干的美帝国主义，也是如此。
    1946年，毛泽东同志就指出：“一切反动派都是纸老虎，看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。”中国人民按照毛泽东同志指出的真理，对帝国主义和国内反动派都是采取坚决打击、决不动摇的方针。打垮了日本帝国主义，打垮了蒋介石八百万军队，打败了美帝国主义的侵略。抗美援朝的斗争，使美帝国主义这只纸老虎原形毕露。当时美帝国主义十分强暴，它有大量的钢铁，大量的军备，纠合了十多个仆从国家的军队，不可一世。然而，中朝人民是不怕虎的英雄，敢于打虎，三年较量下来，戳穿了这个敌人的真面目：不过是纸老虎一只！
    世界上越来越多的人，从自己的实际生活和斗争里，逐渐懂得了这个真理。如果同帝国主义和它的走狗们客气，妥协，“积极共处”，结果就上了它们的圈套，缚住自己的手脚，被人牵着鼻子走；如果同它们坚决地斗呢，那就越斗越强，把帝国主义的圈套变为套住它们自己的绞索，最后，就破除了对帝国主义的迷信，戳穿了这些纸老虎的原来面目。
    亚洲人民的反美风暴，不是清清楚楚地再一次证明这个真理了吗？李承晚、曼德列斯、岸信介，骑在人民头上，耀武扬威，“固一世之雄也，而今安在哉！”美帝国主义和它的走狗们，金元，非不少也，军备，非不坚也，计划，非不密也，然而，在南朝鲜人民、土耳其人民和日本人民的铁拳下，它们的结局只有失败、失败、再失败。为什么？就是因为人民再也不是任人宰割的羔羊，而是在斗争里锻炼成为不怕虎的英雄了！
    不怕虎的英雄，纵使手无寸铁，也会进行坚决的搏斗。武松当年不也是断了哨棒，赤手空拳地打死景阳冈上的猛虎的么？反过来，纵使武器精备，物力充足，却畏畏缩缩，不敢斗争，结果一定自讨苦吃。
    毛泽东同志早就指出了：“在野兽面前，不可以表示丝毫的怯懦，我们要学景阳冈上的武松。在武松看来，景阳冈上的老虎，刺激它也是那样，不刺激它也是那样，总之是要吃人的。或者把老虎打死，或者被老虎吃掉，二者必居其一。”（“论人民民主专政”）
    让我们学习英雄的古巴人民吧。比起许多国家，古巴人口是少的，国土是小的，经济是不发达的，而且就在老虎身边，从美国的佛罗里达到古巴，只有半小时的路程。然而，请看一看古巴人民反抗美帝国主义侵略的英雄气概吧！美国说：你不听话，就要停止对你的“援助”！古巴说：收起你那个伪善的“援助”吧，我们不稀罕！美国派飞机来捣蛋，古巴人民就打下它。美国派特务搞破坏，古巴人民就镇压他们。古巴革命武装部部长劳尔·卡斯特罗说得好：古巴的斗争粉碎了帝国主义是不可战胜的神话。他说：历史证明，美帝国主义是一只羽毛脱落的老鹰，它的爪子由于掠夺拉丁美洲各国人民而受了伤。它已经飞得越来越低，终有一天它会掉在地上爬行。
    这样的不怕虎的英雄，在日本，在亚洲，在非洲，在拉丁美洲，越来越多。正像毛泽东同志对日本文学家代表团指出的：“日本人民反对美帝国主义及其在日本的代理人、要求民族独立和民主自由的胜利斗争，对于中国人民和世界人民反对美帝国主义侵略、维护世界和平的斗争是一个极大的支持。”全世界人民在打虎的战斗中，总是互相鼓舞、互相支持的。
    唯真英雄不怕虎！那些不敢打虎的人们，或者是对虎性认识不足，或者是还有些与虎谋皮的不切实际的幻想，总之是有点“怕”。这些人应该赶快觉悟起来，要知道，不管什么时代的虎，总是要吃人的。武松的时代要打虎，二十世纪六十年代仍然要打虎，这道理，永远也不会“过时”。至于那些现代修正主义者，扮演了为虎作伥的角色，哄骗人来供虎吃，那就更是可恶之至，无耻之尤了。
