　　Autumn Festival is approaching, celebrating the bright moon. Thousands of households are preparing fragrant cakes in abundance. If American flour is used, the cakes themselves are impure. Flour from the Stars and Stripes contains the blood of China. People eat it with unease, and the gods disapprove. All my compatriots feel disgust. Repay kindness with kindness, change course. It is better to make rice cakes, which is the fastest way. The taste is high, the price is low, and the strength of the collective is united. This thing, this aspiration, we eat with our own strength. The sun and moon shine again on China, first seen in Guangdong.

    倡说不用美面月饼歌
    佛山自强社
    时将秋节，庆贺明月。千户万家，香饼盛设。倘用美面，饼自不洁。花旗之面，中华之血。人食不甘，神鉴不屑。凡我同胞，均皆齿切。赠李投桃，改弦易辙。宁制米饼，最为快捷。味高价廉，魄团体结。此物此志，吾食吾力。日月重华，先睹吾粤。
