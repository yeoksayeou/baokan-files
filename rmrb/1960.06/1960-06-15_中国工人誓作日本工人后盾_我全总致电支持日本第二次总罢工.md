Xinhua News Agency, June 14th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions today sent a telegram to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) and the National Council Against Revision of the Security Treaty, warmly supporting the Japanese workers and people in their nationwide second general strike and mass demonstrations on June 15th to smash the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and oppose Eisenhower's visit to Japan.

The telegram said, "U.S. imperialism and its running dog Nobusuke Kishi clique have done all kinds of evil, and their days are numbered. The angry volcano of the Japanese workers and people is waiting for Eisenhower. In your raging anti-American patriotic struggle, the Chinese workers and the people of the whole country vow to be your strong backing. We wish the 'June 15th' general strike and the 18th unified action a glorious success."
