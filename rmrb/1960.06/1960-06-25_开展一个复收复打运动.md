Launch a Campaign for Repeated Harvesting and Threshing
By a Commentator from this Newspaper

Recently, the Luoyang, Xuchang, and Kaifeng special districts in Henan Province launched a “Wheat Re-harvesting” campaign for repeated harvesting and careful threshing. More than 2.3 million people were mobilized daily to glean wheat, and have already recovered over 75 million jin of wheat ears and grains. Many regions in Shaanxi, Shandong, Hebei and other provinces have also done this and achieved great results.

This year, all regions have paid attention to careful harvesting and threshing during the summer harvest. Generally speaking, the summer harvest work has been done more meticulously than in previous years. However, it cannot be said that this work has been done perfectly. This year, there are particularly many large-area high-yield areas, and wheat matures simultaneously, so it is inevitable that the harvest and threshing are not completely clean during the rush to harvest. This year, various regions have used a large number of new tools for harvesting wheat. Some people were not very skilled in the beginning, which may also affect the quality of the summer harvest. Therefore, it is very appropriate and important to have a "wheat re-harvesting" campaign in a timely manner.

When it comes to increasing production and income, there is nothing more "cost-effective" than launching a "wheat re-harvesting" campaign. According to estimates in Zhenning County, Guizhou Province, the wheat and rapeseed recovered through repeated harvesting and threshing in one week account for about 7% of the total wheat and rapeseed production. According to estimates based on materials from various regions, it is possible to increase production by about 5% through repeated harvesting and threshing. To increase production by 5% during the crop growing season requires tremendous effort. Now, as long as some non-major labor forces are organized for a few days of repeated harvesting and threshing, a 5% increase in income can be achieved, or the 5% of labor results that might have been wasted can be recovered, achieving twice the result with half the effort. Why not do it!

Some people may think that 5% is a small number and not very significant. In fact, there is a lot to gain here. In the era of small-scale peasant economy, each household only cultivated a few acres of wheat, and a 5% increase in income would amount to no more than dozens of jin, which is indeed a small number. Now, for a large and prosperous commune, a 5% increase in income means tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of jin of grain. Can we say that this is insignificant? This year, there are a total of 360 million mu of winter wheat in the country. If repeated harvesting and careful threshing are universally implemented, and each mu yields an additional five jin, 1.8 billion jin of wheat can be increased. This is a huge gain. Our agricultural economy is a large economy of people's communes with a high degree of collectivization, and our country is a large country with a population of 650 million. When considering issues such as repeated harvesting and threshing, we should also start from a broad perspective, focus on details, and calculate small accounts as large accounts in order to see the true significance of various things.

Many places have launched repeated harvesting and threshing campaigns and have achieved good results. Now, this experience should be further used to universally promote this campaign. Generally, carrying out this work will not compete with other work for labor. With proper arrangements, organizing the elderly, children, and students can clean up the crops in the fields and on the roads, and clean up the threshed crops in just a few days. We must truly achieve clean fields and threshing grounds, with every grain stored in granaries and every stalk stacked in piles, in order to achieve both high yield and increased income!

    开展一个复收复打运动
    本报评论员
    河南省洛阳、许昌、开封三个专区，最近开展了一个复收细打的“小麦收”运动，每天有二百三十多万人出动拣麦，已经收回麦穗、麦粒七千五百多万斤。陕西、山东、河北等省许多地区也都这样作了，并且获得了很大的成绩。
    今年各地在夏收中，都注意了细收细打，一般说来，夏收工作比往年做得更加细致。但是，并不能说这个工作已经做到家了。今年大面积丰产方特别多，小麦同时成熟，大家突击抢收，收打不净是难免的。今年各地采用大量新式工具收麦，有些人开始的时候技术不大熟练，也可能影响夏收的质量。因此，及时来个“小麦收”，很应该，很重要。
    谈到增产增收，再没有比开展“小麦收”运动更“划算”的了。据贵州镇宁县估计，通过复收复打，在一周内收回的小麦和油菜籽，大约占小麦、油菜总产量的7％。根据各地的材料估算，通过复收复打，增加5％左右的产量是可能的。在农作物生长期间，要想增产5％，需要付出极大的努力才行。现在，只要组织一些非主要劳动力进行几天复收复打，就可增收5％，或者说把可能浪费了的5％的劳动成果收回来，事半功倍，何乐不为！
    有人也许认为，5％数字很小，油水不大。其实，这里面油水大的很。在小农经济时代，一家一户只种几亩小麦，增收5％，充其量不过几十斤，数字确实很小。现在，一个家大业大的公社，增收5％，就是几万甚至十几万斤粮食，能说油水很小？今年全国共有三亿六千万亩冬小麦，如果普遍实行复收细打，以每亩增产五斤计，可以增收十八亿斤小麦，这油水就太大了。我们的农业经济是集体化程度很高的人民公社的大经济，我们的国家是一个拥有六亿五千万人口的大国家，考虑像复收复打这样的问题，也应该从大处着眼，小处落笔，把小账作大账算，才能看到各种事情的真意义。
    很多地方开展复收复打运动，已经取得了良好的成绩。现在应该进一步运用这个经验，把这个运动普遍开展起来。开展这项工作，一般不会发生跟别的工作争劳力的问题。只要加以适当的安排，把老年人、儿童、学生组织起来，几天工夫就可以把田间、路上的庄稼拣净，把打过的庄稼弄净。我们要真正做到地净场光，颗粒入仓，秸秆归垛，才算丰产增收！
