New Developments in the Whole Party Running Newspapers

More than 260 journalists gloriously attended the National Congress of Advanced Workers in Culture and Education. Among them were editors, reporters, and broadcasters from newspapers and periodicals, news agencies, and broadcasting systems at the central, provincial (municipal), prefectural, and county levels; there were also representatives of non-professional correspondence writing organizations. The deeds of various news units they reported to the congress showed that China's news industry, under the direct leadership of the Party and relying on the strength of the whole Party, has become the Party and the people's loyal eyes, ears, and voice, an important bridge for the Party to connect with hundreds of millions of people every day, and a powerful tool for the Party to guide the revolutionary struggle and construction.

"Walking on Two Legs" and "Three-Way Combination"

The representative of Anhui Daily said that since 1958, Anhui Province, according to Chairman Mao's instruction that the first secretary of the Party committee should take the lead in leading the newspaper work, has established writing groups led by the first secretary from the provincial Party committee to the local (city) Party committees, county Party committees, commune Party committees, factories, mines, and university Party committees, responsible for writing news, comments, and articles for newspapers, periodicals, news agencies, and broadcasting departments. The writing groups of leading organs above the county Party committee alone number 182, with 2,354 full-time and part-time members, each writing group having five to ten full-time personnel. Such a huge writing force is not unique to Anhui Province; in other provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, communication organizations under the direct command of the Party committee are also rapidly growing. In Henan Province, Baihe People's Commune in Mengjin County alone has 64 communication groups, with 428 activists from all fronts of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, under the leadership of the commune Party committee secretaries in charge of different areas and fronts, combining their own work to carry out reporting work. Over the past year, they have provided more than 3,600稿件(manuscripts) to county newspapers, radio stations, and even central-level newspapers and broadcasting units, of which more than 1,170 have been adopted.

These examples show the high concern and importance attached to the news industry by Party committees at all levels, which has given our news industry an unparalleled mass foundation. At present, from the central government to the provinces, cities, prefectures, and counties, down to the people's communes and industrial and mining enterprises, a powerful and thorough communication network has been established under the direct leadership of Party committees at all levels. This is a further development of the whole Party running the newspaper policy in the new historical period.

The whole Party running newspapers is the glorious tradition of our Party's news industry. Since the founding of the country, especially in recent years, with the Great Leap Forward in socialist revolution and construction, this tradition has undergone new and significant developments. Now, a new situation of "walking on two legs" and "three-way combination" has emerged in our news work. Those engaged in the Party's news work every day include not only the growing ranks of professional journalists, but also a large number of full-time and part-time correspondents spread across various posts and corners; many major propaganda tasks are completed by the "three-way combination" of leading cadres of the Party, professional journalists, and staff directly participating in actual struggles. The formation of this "walking on two legs" and "three-way combination" not only opens up an extremely wide and rich source of news reports, but also greatly improves the quality of news work, especially because "walking on two legs" and "three-way combination" have many aspects of content, thus demonstrating strong vitality in the development of the news industry.

The "two legs" in news work, on the one hand, refer to the professional journalism team and the non-professional communication organization, and on the other hand, to the full-time members and non-full-time members of the Party committee's communication groups and writing groups; the so-called "three-way combination," in terms of the entire news work, is the combination of the leadership of the Party committee, professional news workers, and the vast number of correspondents; in terms of an important report, it is the combination of leading cadres, news workers, and the masses; in terms of working methods, it is the combination of work, study, and writing. The content of this "walking on two legs" and "three-way combination" is constantly developing with the continuous leap forward situation. The experience of Jiangsu Xinhua Daily, Xinhua News Agency Jiangsu Branch, Shaanxi Daily and other news units proves that the further in-depth implementation of the whole Party running the newspaper policy will enable newspapers to be more closely linked to the masses, linked to reality, and better fulfill the organizational, encouraging, inspiring, critical, and promoting role of newspapers.

Promoters of the Great Leap Forward

The representative of Yancheng Masses Daily in Jiangsu Province, with its glorious history of seventeen years, brought to the congress a series of experiences in publicizing the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune over the past two years. From the deeds of this newspaper, just one example can show the enormous power brought to news work by the whole Party running newspapers, "walking on two legs" and "three-way combination." After the Yancheng Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the task of "catching up with the south of the Yangtze River" at the end of last year, the newspaper's editors, reporters, and more than 6,000 correspondents cooperated closely, under the direct guidance of responsible cadres of the prefectural committee, and in just two and a half months, published 20 relevant editorials, more than 40 articles of various styles, more than 200 news reports and communications, and more than 80 diverse literary works. In addition, it organized 11 issues of reports in the form of discussions, prominently, systematically, and deeply conducting propaganda, playing a huge role in organizing and promoting the local masses to achieve this historically significant and great task.

The new development of the whole Party running newspapers has brought a new look to news work, ensuring that the Party's line, principles, and policies are accurately, comprehensively, and profoundly reflected in news work. In a series of movements such as vigorously building water conservancy, achieving agricultural bumper harvests, vigorously developing steel, communization of the people, technological revolution, and cultural revolution, our newspapers, news agencies, and broadcasting departments have always held high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, enthusiastically publicizing the "three magic weapons" of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, becoming the most steadfast and enthusiastic promoters of socialist revolution and construction. The deeds of every news unit attending this conference can illustrate this point. Historically, the eastern region of Fujian Province has always been described as a place of "high mountains, cold water, barren land, and poor people," so the "backwardness theory" has long seriously bound the thinking of the masses here. According to the instructions of the CPC Prefectural Committee, Mindong Daily seized the fact that Mindong's early rice yield per unit area ranked first in the province and other facts. Under the big title of "Cold Water Only Fears Hot Hearts, High Mountains Can't Compare to High Enthusiasm, Poor People and Barren Land Must Revolutionize, the Provincial First Red Flag is Flying," it vigorously, continuously, and repeatedly publicized Chairman Mao's instruction of "poverty gives rise to the desire for change," criticized the "backwardness theory," encouraged the masses to break superstitions, liberate their minds, and inspire people to give full play to their subjective initiative and quickly change the face of "poverty and blankness." Under the powerful encouragement of the newspaper, the poor teams in the local rural people's communes launched a competition to catch up with the rich teams. Some poor teams mustered the greatest enthusiasm and, as a result, caught up with or surpassed the rich teams in just one year.

In the Great Leap Forward, Harbin Daily in Heilongjiang Province created a short and lively "reporting victory news" format, reflecting the new creations, new achievements, and new experiences emerging in various tasks in the local area to the newspaper at the fastest speed, which was widely welcomed by readers. The authors of this "reporting victory news" are the creators and organizers of the achievements and experiences reported—Party organizations or advanced collectives—so it is more combative and inspiring. The "reporting victory news" column has become a position for various departments and the masses to compare their efforts and strive to be upstream. The newspaper's organization of this news directly played the role of organizing the competition. The deeds of Harbin Daily and many other news units prove that the implementation of "walking on two legs" and "three-way combination" in news work has effectively implemented the Party's mass line in news work, and the connection between news reports and reality and the masses is unprecedentedly close, so that the achievements and experiences created by the masses in the Great Leap Forward can be reflected in a timely, accurate, and comprehensive manner, becoming the wealth of the whole people.

The Whole Party Runs Newspapers, the Whole Party Uses Newspapers

In our country, Party organizations and cadres at all levels regard the news industry as an important component of the Party's entire cause, regard news work as one of their responsibilities, and provide journalists with various convenient working conditions. Major reporting tasks are completed under the direct leadership of Party organizations, with collective wisdom and strength, which has incomparable superiority over news reporters carrying out interview activities alone. When reporters from the Anhui Branch of Xinhua News Agency went to Fuyang County to collect reports on various high-yield crops, the First Secretary of the CPC County Committee convened two meetings with the participation of secretaries of the County Party Committee Secretariat, ministers of rural work, directors of offices, county heads, directors of agriculture bureaus, and directors of water conservancy bureaus to jointly discuss and study the theme and content of the report with the reporters, formulate a writing outline, and organize relevant personnel to help collect materials, successfully completing this reporting task. Of the稿件(manuscripts) sent by this branch to the Xinhua News Agency headquarters and the People's Daily from January to April this year, 40% were provided by the writing groups of Party committees at all levels.

With the expansion of the writing team and communication network led by the Party committee, the news, articles, commentaries, etc., published daily by newspapers, periodicals, news agencies, and radio stations, are increasingly provided by workers who directly participate in and guide actual struggles, thus ensuring that news propaganda is increasingly rich and colorful, and closely linked to the Party's intentions and the masses' demands. Taking the commentaries and articles that are relatively difficult to master in news writing as an example, the theses written by non-professional authors, especially leading cadres of Party committees at all levels, have occupied a prominent place in newspapers and periodicals. The representative of the People's Daily mentioned in his speech that in the first quarter of this year, 40 articles were published by the secretaries of provincial, municipal, and autonomous region Party committees, more than double the average of 18 articles per quarter last year. More than 70% of the editorials in the Liaoning Province Lüda Daily were written by leading cadres of Party committees at all levels and various departments. Because they have rich practical work experience, a deep understanding of the Party's principles and policies, and direct contact with the masses, the reports and articles they write can be targeted, rich in content, easy to understand, and very popular among readers.

In the era of the Great Leap Forward, inserting red flags, establishing benchmarks, and encouraging hundreds of millions of people to learn from the advanced in every possible way is one of the most important tasks that newspapers often do. Shanxi Daily has done a relatively prominent job in this regard. The advanced models established by this newspaper for the people of the province numbered 295 in 1958, increased to 420 in 1959, and reached 149 from January to April this year. This newspaper has made valuable contributions to the vigorous mass competition movement of "red, diligent, skillful, and thrifty" in all walks of life in Shanxi Province.

From the materials introduced by many news units, it can be seen that Party organizations and leading cadres at all levels now not only actively participate in running newspapers, but also use newspapers to guide their work anytime and anywhere in their work. They all regard the use of news reports as an important way to promote work and improve the work of the areas or departments they lead based on the advanced experiences introduced in the newspapers.

The whole Party running newspapers enables our news work to fully achieve from the masses, to the masses, and be closely linked to the broad masses of the people. The people have a very cordial and trusting feeling about news reports. Whenever people have problems they cannot figure out, they always say: "Let's see what the newspaper says!" If someone does a good deed, the people around them will say: "Give him a report in the newspaper!" Workers and peasants reflect: "If you don't read the newspaper for a day, it's like sleeping; if you don't read the newspaper for two days, you don't know anything; if you don't read the newspaper for three days, your brain doesn't work; if you want to leap forward in production, you must read the newspaper every day." Whenever a newspaper or radio station reports a successful experience, many people immediately travel hundreds or thousands of miles by plane or train to visit and learn.

The Working Class News Team is Growing

In the process of implementing the whole Party running the newspaper policy, the working class news team is growing rapidly. A large number of cadres with practical revolutionary struggle experience and outstanding correspondents from workers and peasants have joined the ranks of professional journalists. News units such as Heilongjiang Daily, Xinhua News Agency Heilongjiang Branch, and Harbin Daily are now training and training a group of advanced workers who have both production experience, a certain level of culture, and high political awareness to serve as editors and reporters. Harbin Daily alone has transferred 200 workers, and some of them have been able to conduct interview activities independently after a short period of training in interview and editing work. At the same time, the original professional journalists, after the rectification movement, have made political command, resolutely listened to the Party, strictly followed the Party's intentions, often went deep into reality, deep into the masses, shared the fate and breathed with the masses, completed the propaganda tasks, and also transformed their ideological style. In the revolutionary furnace, they gradually burned the remaining poison of bourgeois news views, accepted the arming of Mao Zedong Thought, and became loyal soldiers of the Party and simple and diligent servants of the masses. During the Great Steelmaking Movement, reporters from the Qinghai People's Broadcasting Station and the Guangxi Daily fought alongside workers and peasants beside the furnace, making steel while interviewing, writing touching reports, and also refining their own thinking. Two reporters from the Xinhua News Agency Tibet Branch interviewed the news of the Chinese mountaineering team climbing Mount Everest. They shared weal and woe with the mountaineers, not only reporting the great victory of the Chinese mountaineering team's ascent to the world's highest peak to the people of the country and the world in a timely and detailed manner, but also climbing to an altitude of 6,600 meters above sea level themselves. This is an unprecedented record in the history of Chinese and foreign reporters interviewing mountaineering news.

Comrade Lin Feng said in his report at this conference: "China's news industry has given full play to its combat effectiveness in the international scope of class struggle and in the domestic class struggle, becoming a more powerful propaganda tool for the proletariat and a more powerful tool for educating the broad masses of the people with Marxism-Leninism and modern scientific and cultural knowledge." This is the greatest glory and reward the Party has given to journalists, and it also puts forward a lofty and arduous task for us. Comrades in arms on the news front, let us hold high the red banner of invincible Mao Zedong Thought, continue to adhere to and develop the glorious tradition of the whole Party running newspapers, better give play to the role of the Party's propaganda weapon, and always be revolutionary vanguards and promoters.

    全党办报的新发展
    二百六十多名新闻工作者，光荣地出席了全国文教先进工作者代表大会。他们当中有中央、省（市）、专区、县等各级报刊和通讯社、广播系统的编辑、记者、广播员等；也有非专业的通讯写作组织的代表。他们向大会汇报的各个新闻单位的事迹表明，我国的新闻事业，在党的直接领导下，依靠全党力量，已经成为党和人民群众的忠实的耳目喉舌，成为党每天联系亿万群众的重要桥梁，成为党指导革命斗争和建设事业的有力工具。
    “两条腿走路”和“三结合”
    安徽日报的代表说，安徽省从1958年开始，根据毛主席关于党委第一书记挂帅领导报纸工作的指示，从省委起，各地（市）委、县委、公社党委、厂矿和大专学校的党委，都建立了由第一书记挂帅的写作小组，负责为报刊、通讯社、广播部门写新闻、评论、文章等。光是县委以上领导机关的写作小组就有一百八十二个，拥有专职和非专职的成员两千三百五十四人，其中每个写作小组都有五个到十个专职人员。这样庞大的写作队伍，不只安徽一个省有，其他省、市和自治区在党委直接指挥下的通讯组织也在迅速壮大起来。河南省单是孟津县一个白合人民公社，就有六十四个通讯小组，有四百二十八名工、农、商、学、兵各条战线的积极分子，在公社党委书记们的分片分战线的领导下，结合本身工作，进行报道工作。一年来，他们向县报、广播站直到中央一级报刊、广播单位共提供了三千六百多篇稿件，被采用一千一百七十多篇。
    这些事例显示，各级党委对新闻事业的高度关怀和重视，因而使我们的新闻事业具有无比雄厚的群众基础。目前，从中央到省、市，到专区、县，直到人民公社和工矿企业，已经建立起一个在各级党委直接领导下的强大而周密的通讯网。这是全党办报方针在新的历史时期的进一步发展。
    全党办报，是我们党的新闻事业的光荣传统。建国以来，特别是近几年来，随着社会主义革命和建设事业的大跃进，这个传统又有了新的重大发展。现在，在我们新闻工作中出现了“两条腿走路”和“三结合”的新局面。每天从事党的新闻事业的，不仅有日益壮大的专业新闻工作者队伍，而且有广布各个岗位、各个角落的专职和非专职的大量通讯员；许许多多重大的宣传任务，都是由党的领导干部、专业新闻工作者和直接参加实际斗争的工作人员“三结合”完成的。这种“两条腿走路”和“三结合”的形成，不仅为新闻报道开辟了极其广泛和丰富的来源，而且大大提高了新闻工作的质量，特别是因为“两条腿走路”和“三结合”具有多方面的内容，因而在新闻事业的发展中表现了强大的生命力。
    新闻工作中的“两条腿”，一方面是指专业新闻工作队伍和非专业的通讯组织而说，另方面是指党委的通讯组、写作组的专职成员和非专职成员而说；所谓“三结合”，就整个新闻工作说，是党委的领导、专业新闻工作人员和广大通讯员相结合；就一项重要报道来讲，是领导干部、新闻工作者和群众相结合；就工作方法来说，是工作、学习、写作相结合。这种“两条腿走路”和“三结合”的内容，正随着持续跃进的形势不断有所发展。江苏新华日报、新华社江苏分社、陕西日报等新闻单位的经验证明，全党办报方针的进一步深入贯彻，将会使报纸更加密切地联系群众、联系实际，更好地完成报纸的组织、鼓舞、激励、批判、推动的作用。
    大跃进的促进派
    有十七年光荣历史的江苏省盐阜大众报的代表，给大会带来了他们两年多来宣传总路线、大跃进、人民公社的一系列经验。从这家报纸的事迹里，只要举一个例子，就可以看到全党办报，“两条腿走路”和“三结合”，给新闻工作带来的巨大威力。这家报纸，在中共盐城地委去年年底提出“赶江南”的任务以后，报纸的编辑、记者和六千多名通讯员密切合作，在地委负责干部的直接指导下，在短短的两个半月里，就发表了二十篇有关的社论，四十多篇各种体裁的文章，二百多篇消息和通讯，八十多篇多种多样的文艺作品，此外还组织了十一期讨论会形式的报道，突出地、系统地、深入地进行了宣传，对组织和推动当地群众实现这一具有历史意义的伟大任务，发挥了巨大的作用。
    全党办报的新发展，给新闻工作带来了新的面貌，保证了党的路线、方针、政策在新闻工作中得到了准确、全面、深刻的体现。在大兴水利，农业丰产、大办钢铁、人民公社化、技术革命、文化革命等一系列的运动中，我们的报纸、通讯社和广播部门，都一直高举毛泽东思想的红旗，满腔热情地宣传总路线、大跃进、人民公社“三大法宝”，成为社会主义革命和建设事业最坚定、最热情的促进派。出席这次大会的每一个新闻单位的事迹，都能说明这一点。福建省的东部地区，在历史上一向被人形容为“山高、水冷、地薄、人穷”的地方，因此地区“落后论”长期的严重地束缚这里群众的思想。闽东日报根据中共地委的指示，抓住闽东早稻单位面积产量跃居全省第一位等事实，曾在“水冷只怕心火热，山高哪及干劲高，人穷地薄要革命，全省第一红旗飘”的大标题下，大张旗鼓的连续的反复的宣传了毛主席指示的“穷则思变”的思想，批判了“落后论”，鼓励群众打破迷信，解放思想，激励人们发挥最大的主观能动性，迅速改变“一穷二白”的面貌。在报纸这样有力的鼓舞下，当地农村人民公社里的穷队，发起了赶富队的竞赛，有些穷队鼓起了最大的干劲，结果一年就赶上或超过了富队。
    黑龙江省哈尔滨日报在大跃进中，创造了短小活泼的“报捷新闻”形式，每天将当地各项工作中涌现的新创造、新成就、新经验，以最快的速度反映到报纸上，受到读者的普遍欢迎。这种“报捷新闻”的作者，就是所报道的成就和经验的创造者和组织者——党组织或先进集体，因此它富有更大的战斗性和鼓舞作用。“报捷新闻”栏已经成为各部门和群众比干劲，争上游的一个阵地。报纸组织这种新闻，直接地起到了组织竞赛的作用。哈尔滨日报及其他许多新闻单位的事迹都证明，在新闻工作中实行“两条腿走路”和“三结合”，使党的群众路线在新闻工作中得到了有效的贯彻，新闻报道同实际和群众的联系空前紧密，使群众在大跃进中所创造的成就和经验，及时地、准确地、全面地反映出来，成为全民的财富。全党办报全党用报
    在我国，党的各级组织和干部，都把新闻事业看作是党的整个事业的一个重要组成部分，把新闻工作当作自己的职责之一，并且给新闻工作者提供了各种便利的工作条件。各项重大的报道的任务，都是在党组织的直接领导下，以集体的智慧和力量完成的，这比新闻记者单枪匹马的进行采访活动，有着不可比拟的优越性。新华社安徽分社的记者，到阜阳县采写多种高产作物的报道过程中，中共县委第一书记曾经召开两次有县委书记处书记、农村工作部长、办公室主任和县长、农业局长、水利局等负责干部参加的会议，和记者一道共同讨论研究报道的主题思想、内容，拟定写作提纲，组织有关人员帮助搜集材料，圆满地完成了这次报道任务。这个分社今年1月到4月，发给新华总社和人民日报的稿件中，40％是各级党委的写作小组供给的。
    随着党委所领导的写作队伍和通讯网的扩大，报刊、通讯社、广播电台每天所发表的消息、文章、评论等，由直接参加和指导实际斗争的工作者提供的稿件越来越多，从而保证了新闻宣传日益丰富多彩，同党的意图和群众的要求息息相通。就以新闻写作中比较难于掌握的评论和文章来说，非专业的作者、特别是各级党委领导干部写的论文，已经在报刊上占据显著的篇幅。人民日报的代表发言中提到，今年第一季度发表的各省、市和自治区党委书记写的文章，就有四十篇，超过去年平均每季度十八篇的一倍以上。辽宁省旅大日报70％以上的社论，是各级党委和各部门的负责干部写的。由于他们有着丰富的实际工作经验，对党的方针政策有深刻的理解，和群众有着直接的联系，因而他们写的报道和文章都能作到有的放矢，内容丰富，通俗易懂，很受读者欢迎。
    在大跃进的时代里，插红旗，树标兵，鼓舞亿万人民千方百计地向先进的看齐，是报纸经常的最重要的任务之一。山西日报在这方面作的比较突出，经过这家报纸给全省人民树立起来的先进榜样，1958年有二百九十五个，1959年增加到四百二十个，今年1月到4月就达一百四十九个。这家报纸对山西省各行各业开展轰轰烈烈的“红、勤、巧、俭”群众性竞赛运动，作出了宝贵的贡献。
    从许多新闻单位介绍的材料中，可以看到现在各级党组织和领导干部，不仅积极参加办报，而且在工作中，随时随地运用报纸指导工作。他们都把运用新闻报道，作为推动工作的重要途径，根据报纸上介绍的先进经验，来改进自己所领导的地区或部门的工作。
    全党办报，使我们的新闻工作全面地作到了从群众中来，到群众中去，和广大群众血肉相联，人民群众对新闻报道感到非常亲切和莫大的信赖。每当人们有弄不清楚的问题时，总是说：“看看报纸怎样说吧！”有谁作了一件好事，周围的人就会说：“给他登个报！”工人、农民反映：“一天不读报，好像睡了觉，两天不读报，啥也不知道，三天不读报，脑筋不开窍，生产要跃进，天天要读报。”每当报纸或广播电台报道一个成功的经验时，立刻就有不少的人，从远自几百里、几千里以外坐飞机、乘火车前往参观、学习。
    工人阶级新闻队伍在成长
    在执行全党办报的方针过程中，工人阶级的新闻工作队伍正在迅速成长。大批有着实际革命斗争经验的干部，和工、农出身的优秀通讯员，加入了专业的新闻工作者行列。黑龙江日报、新华社黑龙江分社、哈尔滨日报等新闻单位现在正培养和训练一批既有生产经验，又有一定文化水平，政治觉悟高的先进工人，担任编辑、记者，仅哈尔滨日报就调进二百名工人，其中一部分人经过短期参加采访编辑工作的锻炼，已经能够独立地进行采访活动。同时，原有专业新闻工作者经过整风运动，作到了政治挂帅，坚决听党的话，严格地按照党的意图办事，经常深入实际，深入群众，同群众共命运，同呼吸，完成了宣传任务，也改造了自己的思想作风。在革命的熔炉里，逐步烧掉了资产阶级新闻观点的遗毒，接受了毛泽东思想的武装，成为党的忠诚战士，群众的朴实勤务员。青海人民广播电台和广西日报的记者在大办钢铁运动期间，同工人、农民一起战斗在炉旁，一边炼钢铁，一边采访，写出了感动人的报道，也炼红了自己的思想。新华社西藏分社有两位记者，采访中国登山队攀登珠穆朗玛峰的消息，他们同登山队员们同甘共苦，不仅将我国登山队登上世界第一高峰的伟大胜利，及时地详细地报道给全国全世界的人民，而且他们自己也曾攀登到拔海六千六百米的高度，这在中外记者采访登山消息的历史上，还是前所未闻的记录。
    林枫同志在这次大会上的报告中说：“我国的新闻事业，在国际范围内的阶级斗争中，在国内的阶级斗争中，都发挥了充分的战斗性，成为无产阶级的更加有力的宣传工具，成为用马克思列宁主义思想和现代科学文化知识教育广大人民群众的更加有力的工具。”这是党给新闻工作者的莫大光荣和奖励，同时也向我们提出了崇高和艰巨的任务。新闻战线上的战友们，让我们高举战无不胜的毛泽东思想的红旗，继续坚持和发展全党办报的光荣传统，更好地发挥党的宣传武器的作用，永远做革命的尖兵和促进派。
