	Simple Methods, High Efficiency
	He Qing
	In the vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the creations and inventions of workers are numerous, and many of them do not require complex equipment and technology, but can achieve high efficiency. The "smooth sliding" of loading and unloading at Beijing Freight Station is an example. It simply uses the basic principle of "water flowing downwards," utilizing the weight of the object itself to allow goods to slide automatically from high to low. The required equipment is very simple, doesn't cost much money, and the operation is not complicated, but it saves a lot of labor and increases loading and unloading efficiency several times, even dozens or hundreds of times, thereby greatly speeding up the turn-around of vehicles.
	People's habits often lead them to associate complex things with the word "advanced," and simple things with the word "low-level." This concept often invisibly binds people's minds and hinders bold changes. In fact, the standard of "advanced" versus "low-level" is never complexity versus simplicity, but is measured by the level of efficiency and quality. Look, when Beijing Xibianmen Station was handling round steel, using machinery to load a car took two people ninety minutes during the initial innovation stages; now, with the implementation of smooth sliding, it only takes two people to push it down from a high place, and loading a car takes only one minute. It can be seen that simple is sometimes more economical and more efficient, that is, more "advanced."
	We must not only break the view of looking down on "simple," but also vigorously promote those simple, economical, and efficient creations and inventions. Because the more such creations and inventions are, the easier they are to implement, the easier they are to promote, the easier it is to achieve twice the result with half the effort, and the more they conform to the spirit of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results.
	It is hoped that large and small stations, as well as enterprises with large loading and unloading workloads, will promote the most economical and efficient loading and unloading method—smooth sliding. It is hoped that more of the most economical and efficient creations and inventions will emerge in all walks of life!

    土办法　高效率
    河清
    在轰轰烈烈的技术革新和技术革命运动中，职工们的创造发明千千万万，其中有很多不需要什么复杂的设备和技术，却能取得很高的效率。北京货运车站装卸滑溜化就是一例。它只是根据“水往低处流”的简单原理，利用物体自身重量，让货物从高到低自动滑下，需要的设备很简单，花钱不多，操作也不复杂，但是却节省了大量的劳动力，使装卸效率提高几倍以至几十倍、几百倍，从而大大加快了车辆周转的速度。
    人们的习惯，常常是一看到复杂的东西，就容易跟“高级”两个字联系起来；一看到简单的东西，就容易跟“低级”联系起来。这种观念，常常无形中束缚了人们的头脑，阻碍了人们大胆地变革。实际上，“高级”与“低级”的标准绝不是复杂与简单，而是以效率、质量的高低来衡量的。请看，北京西便门车站搬运圆钢，开始革新时用机械，装满一车要两个人用九十分钟；现在实行滑溜化，只要两个人从高处往下一推，装一车只要一分钟。可见，简单的有时更经济，效率更高，也就是说，更“高级”。
    我们不仅要打破看不起“简单”的观念，而且要大力推崇那些简单的、经济的、效率高的创造发明。因为越是这样的创造发明，愈容易实行，愈容易推广，愈容易取得事半功倍的效果，愈符合多快好省的精神。
    希望大、小车站，以及装卸作业量大的企业都来推广最经济的高效率的装卸方法——滑溜化，希望各行各业出现更多的最经济的高效率的创造发明！
