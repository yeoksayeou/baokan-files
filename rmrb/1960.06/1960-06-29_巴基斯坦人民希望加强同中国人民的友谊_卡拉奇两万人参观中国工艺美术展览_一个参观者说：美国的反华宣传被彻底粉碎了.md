Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, June 26th: The Chinese Arts and Crafts Exhibition closed in Karachi on the evening of the 26th. Over the past eighteen days, more than 20,000 Pakistani people from all walks of life visited the exhibition.

Tonight, the exhibition hall was particularly crowded. Some people who had already visited the exhibition came here again tonight to say goodbye. They shook hands with the Chinese exhibition staff, expressing their congratulations and friendly feelings towards the Chinese people. Many visitors said that they learned about the real situation in China through this exhibition. An employee of the Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation said to the Chinese exhibition staff, "The exhibits themselves say everything. They have thoroughly smashed American anti-China propaganda."

Another visitor said, "I am very happy to know that China is more advanced than Western countries in art and culture. I wish China and its people will become more prosperous."

Many people crowded around the visitors' book, patiently waiting for the opportunity to write down their good wishes for China. One visitor enthusiastically wrote: "The Chinese people are our friends and dear brothers."

An employee of an oil company enthusiastically shook hands with the Chinese staff and said, "Congratulations to you. All the exhibits are outstanding, wonderful, and unparalleled. Your country is the pride of Asia." He continued that he hoped to become a member of the Pakistan-China Friendship Association so that he could do something to promote friendship between the two countries.

An elderly man from Lahore said to the Chinese exhibition staff, "My father went to China fifty years ago. When I was a child, he told me a lot about the Chinese people. Today, I am very happy that China has become so prosperous and strong. I hope our friendship will be strengthened."

Among the visitors were also some Indians. A girl of about twenty years old enthusiastically wrote in the guest book under the name of "A visitor from India": "I am very fortunate to see the fascinating Chinese exhibition here. We are proud of our Chinese brothers for creating such beautiful art. I hope to learn the art of the Chinese people."

In the visitors' book, one can see many such words: "Long live the People's China!" "Long live the Chinese people!" "Salute to the New China."

    新华社卡拉奇26日电　中国工艺美术品展览会26日晚上在卡拉奇闭幕。在过去十八天中，有两万多巴基斯坦各阶层人士参观了展览会。
    今天晚上，展览厅里特别拥挤。一些已经参观过展览会的人今晚再一次到这里来告别。他们握着中国展览会工作人员的手，表示他们的祝贺以及对中国人民的友好的感情。很多参观者表示，他们通过这次展览会了解到中国的真实情况。巴基斯坦工业发展公司的一个雇员向中国展览会的工作人员说，“展览品本身就说明了一切。它们彻底粉碎了美国的反华宣传。”
    另一个参观者说，“我非常高兴地知道，中国在艺术和文化方面比西方国家更进步。我愿意中国和它的人民将更加繁荣。”
    很多人挤在参观者留言簿的周围，耐心地等待机会写下他们对中国的良好愿望。一位参观者热情地写道：“中国人民是我们的朋友和亲爱的兄弟。”
    一位食油公司的雇员热情地握着中国工作人员的手说，“祝贺你们。一切展览品都是杰出的、奇妙的和无以伦比的。你们的国家是亚洲的骄傲。”他继续说，他希望成为巴基斯坦—中国友好协会的一名会员，以便做一些事情来促进这两个国家的友谊。
    来自拉合尔的一个老年人对中国展览会的工作人员说，“我的父亲在五十年前去过中国。在我小时候，他曾经告诉我很多关于中国人民的事情。今天中国变得这样繁荣和强盛，我感到非常高兴。我希望我们的友谊有所加强。”
    在参观者中间还有一些印度人。一个大约二十岁的女孩子在留言簿上以“来自印度的一个参观者”的名义热情洋溢地写道：“我非常幸运地在这里看到迷人的中国展览会。我们对中国兄弟创造出这样美好的艺术感到骄傲。我希望学习中国人民的艺术。”
    在参观者留言簿上人们能够看到很多这样的话：“人民中国万岁！”“中国人民万岁！”“向新中国致敬。”
