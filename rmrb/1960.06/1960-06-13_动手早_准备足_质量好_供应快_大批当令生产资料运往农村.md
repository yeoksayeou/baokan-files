    Xinhua News Agency, June 12th: Commercial departments across the country are actively supplying production materials for the summer harvest and summer planting, supporting current agricultural production.

    This year's summer crop planting area is large, yields are high, and harvests are early. In accordance with these characteristics, commercial departments in various regions, adhering to the spirit of "early" as the priority, have arranged and prepared various production materials for the summer harvest and summer planting one month earlier than in previous years, ensuring early action, adequate preparation, good quality, and quick supply. As of the end of May, Henan Province had supplied 21.06 million pieces of major small farm tools, which can meet the needs; the number of harvesters, threshers, seeders, etc., has increased significantly compared to last year. Shanxi Province has prepared 85% of the farm tools needed for the summer harvest and summer planting in rural areas. The supply of production materials for the summer harvest, summer planting, and summer hoeing in Shaanxi, Hubei, Jilin and other provinces has increased by about 40% compared to the same period last year.

    Among the summer harvest and summer planting farm tools supplied this year, the number of agricultural machinery such as harvesters, threshers, and rice transplanters has greatly increased. In order to give full play to the existing agricultural machinery in the summer harvest and summer planting, commercial departments in various regions have sent a large number of technicians to the countryside to hold training courses and help communes train technicians. Some have gone deep into production teams and fields to conduct demonstration operations and promote new technologies. Commercial departments in many areas also work closely with industrial departments to establish farm tool maintenance stations, adopting the method of simultaneous inspection, repair, parts manufacturing, and matching to repair and match large agricultural machinery in a timely manner, so that the supplied agricultural machinery is put into operation and plays a powerful role in the summer harvest.

    Commercial departments in various regions have conscientiously implemented the policy of "walking on two legs" in the supply of summer harvest and summer planting production materials. In addition to doing a good job in the supply of state-allocated materials, they also actively help commune industries use local steel and local iron to manufacture new farm tools. In mid-May, various regions of Shandong Province had independently produced 3,329 harvesters, 841 threshers, 4.05 million sickles, and more than 10 million other farm tools, meeting production needs in a timely manner. Commercial departments in Jilin Province helped various regions establish 24,000 local fertilizer plants.

    动手早　准备足　质量好　供应快
    大批当令生产资料运往农村
    据新华社12日讯　全国各地商业部门积极供应夏收夏种生产资料，支援当前农业生产。
    今年夏季作物种植面积大、产量多、收获早。根据这一特点，各地商业部门都本着“早”字当先的精神，比往年提前一个月安排准备好夏收夏种的各种生产资料，做到动手早、准备足、质量好、供应快。河南省截至5月底，已供应主要小农具二千一百零六万件，可以满足需要；收割机、脱粒机、播种机等的数量比去年增加很多。山西省农村需要的夏收夏种农具已准备好85％。陕西、湖北、吉林等省今年夏收夏种夏锄用的生产资料供应量比去年同期增长40％左右。
    今年供应的夏收夏种农具中，收割机、脱粒机、水稻插秧机等农业机械的数量有了很大增长。为了使已有的农业机械在夏收夏种中充分发挥作用，各地商业部门都派出大批技术人员到农村，举办训练班，帮助公社训练技术人员。有的深入到生产队、田间，进行示范操作，推广新技术。许多地区的商业部门还与工业部门紧密配合，建立农具维修站，采取边检查、边修理、边制零件、边配套的办法，对大型的农业机械及时进行修理和配套，使供应的农业机械都开动起来，在夏收中发挥威力。
    各地商业部门在夏收夏种生产资料供应工作中认真贯彻了两条腿走路的方针，除做好国家分配的物资供应以外，还积极帮助公社工业用土钢土铁制造新农具。在5月中旬，山东省各地已自行生产收割机三千三百二十九部，脱粒机八百四十一部，镰刀四百零五万张，还有一千多万件其他农具，及时地满足了生产的需要。吉林省商业部门帮助各地建立了二万四千个土化肥厂。
