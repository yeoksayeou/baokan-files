Millions of workers and peasants in Jiangsu Province have entered various levels and types of spare-time schools to study. The mass spare-time learning movement has entered a new stage of large-scale promotion, consistent persistence, and gradual improvement.

While continuing to eliminate the remaining illiteracy, Jiangsu Province has vigorously developed all levels and types of spare-time schools. The number of students enrolled in spare-time primary schools has reached 6.82 million, spare-time junior high schools have more than 760,000 students, spare-time senior high schools have more than 90,000 students, and spare-time universities and secondary specialized schools have more than 70,000 students.  The entire province has spare-time primary schools in every team and spare-time secondary schools in every commune. Some counties have not only universally established spare-time primary schools, but also spare-time junior high schools in every production brigade and spare-time senior high schools in every commune. Factories and mining enterprises have adopted the approach of focusing on both ends and leading the middle, and while vigorously developing spare-time primary schools, spare-time specialized schools and spare-time universities have also greatly developed.  The number of workers studying at Nanjing Spare-time University has increased from more than 4,200 to more than 9,800. Nantong, Yangzhou and other cities have also established many spare-time secondary vocational schools and spare-time elementary technical schools.  On a province-wide scale, a spare-time education system from primary school to university is beginning to take shape. The masses are full of enthusiasm for learning, saying, "Shed the illiteracy label, rise to a higher level, finish primary school and go to middle school, never give up until we go to university."

This spring, many regions held large-scale examinations, promotions, and inspections. In the eleven cities and counties of the Huaiyin Special District, 970,000 students from spare-time schools participated in the examinations, accounting for approximately 75% of the total number of students, of which more than 630,000 passed the examinations and were promoted to spare-time primary schools. Liyang County organized a county-wide general examination for 100,000 young and middle-aged people. More than 93% of the students in spare-time schools participated in the examination. After the examination, the results were published, certificates were issued, and congratulations were sent. The masses saw the results, which greatly encouraged their enthusiasm for running, teaching, and learning schools. Through the examination, the number of students in spare-time primary schools in the county increased from nearly 50,000 to more than 95,000, and the number of students in spare-time junior high schools increased from more than 8,000 to more than 16,000. The Shuyang County Committee also organized a 10,000-person cultural and technical promotion team to conduct inspections in various communes, water conservancy construction sites, and factories. After the inspection, the number of students enrolled in the county reached 200,000, more than doubling the number of students in the past. The communes in each county that were lagging behind in learning have also quickly caught up with the advanced units through inspection.

Party committees at all levels, in carrying out the mass spare-time learning movement, have conscientiously implemented the policy of combining teaching with production and serving politics and production.  Generally, all localities can do what they learn, learn where they produce, and have both fixed textbooks and supplementary materials. In order to make learning more adaptable to the characteristics of busy production, many regions have adopted the method of "overall deployment, specific arrangements, division of labor, and division of management," so that the spare-time learning of the front and rear, cadres and commune members in rural areas can be taken into consideration in a coordinated manner. After the Jiangyin County Party Committee proposed the slogan of "Learn from Yangzhong, catch up with Yangzhong, surpass Yangzhong, and strive to become a county with 1,000 catties of three crops of wheat" in December last year, more than 7,200 classes (groups) of all levels and types of spare-time schools throughout the county universally launched a mass movement of "writing 1,000 catties, teaching 1,000 catties, learning 1,000 catties, doing 1,000 catties, everyone has a 1,000-catty technical book, and every class has a 1,000-catty experimental field." The county's people-run school experimental fields covered 12,405 mu, with 4,950 scientific and technological research groups. Most classes and groups cultivated high-yield champions. Teachers and students of the county's people-run schools cultivated more than 650 mu of three-crop wheat champions, more than 60,000 rapeseed champions, more than 9,400 pig champions, and more than 25,000 broad bean champions. This teaching method that combines politics, culture, and technology, and combines production, teaching, and scientific research, plays an extremely significant role in promoting and popularizing technological transformation and technological innovation in rural areas, thereby promoting the county's production and construction movement.

In order to adapt to the new development of spare-time education and the ever-increasing needs. Party committees at all levels also attach great importance to the training and improvement of mass teachers.  Generally, a large number of spare-time normal schools have been established with communes as schools and production brigades as classes, and some part-work, part-study normal schools and worker-peasant normal schools have been established on a trial basis. The number of people-run teachers participating in spare-time normal school studies in the province has reached more than 310,000, accounting for approximately 60% of the people-run teachers. In addition, according to the principle of combining long-term training with short-term training, counties, cities, communes, and brigades have universally strengthened the short-term training of people-run teachers and extensively carried out various forms of teaching guidance and teaching research activities. The political, cultural, and professional level of many people-run teachers has been significantly improved.

    千万工农进学校　生产学习样样能
    江苏业余教育体系开始形成
    本报讯　江苏省一千零六十万工农进入各级各类业余学校学习。群众业余学习运动已进入大办特办、常年坚持、逐步提高的新阶段。
    江苏省群众业余学习，在继续扫除一批剩余文盲的同时，大办各级各类业余学校，业余小学入学人数达到六百八十二万人，业余初中入学人数达七十六万多人，业余高中九万多人，业余大学、中专有七万多人。全省已经队队有业余小学，社社有业余中学。有的县不仅普遍地举办了业余小学，而且每一个生产大队有业余初中，每一个公社有业余高中。厂矿企业单位采取抓两头、带中间的做法，在大办业余小学的同时，业余专科学校和业余大学也有了很大的发展。南京市业余大学学习的职工人数由四千二百余人增到九千八百余人，南通、扬州等市还举办了许多业余中等专业学校和业余初等技术学校。就全省范围来说，从小学到大学的业余教育体系正在开始形成。群众学习情绪饱满、旺盛，他们说：“脱掉文盲帽，更上一层楼，读完小学读中学，不上大学不罢休”。
    今年春季，不少地区举行了大考试、大升学和大检查。淮阴专区十一个市县业余学校，参加考试的学员达九十七万余人，约占学员总数的75％，其中通过考试升入业余小学学习的有六十三万多人。溧阳县在全县范围内组织了十万青壮年大会考，93％以上的业余学校学员参加了考试，考试后出榜、发证书，贺喜报喜，群众看到了成绩，大大鼓舞了群众办、教、学的积极性，通过考试，全县业余小学学员由近五万人上升到九万五千多人，业余初中学员由八千多人上升到一万六千多人。沭阳县委还组织了一支万人文化技术促进团，深入各公社、水利工地和工厂进行检查。经过检查全县入学人数已达到二十万人，在学人数比过去增加一倍多。各县学习较为落后的公社，通过检查，也迅速地赶上了先进单位。
    各级党委在开展群众业余学习运动中，都认真贯彻教学结合生产和为政治、为生产服务的方针。各地基本上都能做到做什么学什么，生产到那里，学习到那里，既有固定课本，又有补充教材。为使学习更适应生产大忙的特点，很多地区采取“全面部署，具体安排，分线作战，分工管理”的办法，使农村的前方和后方、干部和社员的业余学习都能做到统筹兼顾。江阴县委在去年12月提出“学扬中、赶扬中、超扬中，力争三麦千斤县”的口号后，全县各级各类业余学校七千二百多个班（组）普遍地掀起了“编千斤，教千斤，学千斤，干千斤，人人有千斤技术书，班班有千斤试验田”的群众运动，全县民校试验田有一万二千四百零五亩，科学技术研究小组四千九百五十个，大部班组都搞了高产大王，全县民校教师和学员搞的三麦大王有六百五十余亩，油菜大王六万多棵，猪王九千四百多头，蚕豆大王二万五千多棵，这种政治、文化、技术三结合和生产、教学、科学研究三结合的教学方式方法，对于在农村中宣传和推广技术改造、技术革新，从而对全县生产建设运动起着极其巨大的推动作用。
    为了适应业余教育新的发展和不断提高的需要。各级党委还十分重视对群众教师的培养和提高。各地一般以公社建校、生产大队设班，开办了大量的业余师范，试办了一部分半工半读师范和工农师范。全省参加业余师范学习的民师达三十一万余人，约占民师的60％。此外，根据长期培养和短期训练相结合的原则，各县市和公社、大队普遍地加强了民师的短期训练工作，广泛地开展了各种形式的教学辅导和教学研究活动。不少民师的政治、文化、业务水平都有了显著的提高。
