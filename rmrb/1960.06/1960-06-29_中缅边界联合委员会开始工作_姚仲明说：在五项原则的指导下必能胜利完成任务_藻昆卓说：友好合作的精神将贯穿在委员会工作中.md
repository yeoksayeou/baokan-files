Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, June 28th: The Sino-Burmese Joint Boundary Committee began discussions this morning to formulate methods for resolving specific issues related to the Sino-Burmese border.

    The Chinese side present at the meeting included Chief Representative Yao Zhongming, Representatives Cheng Zhiping, Senior Colonel Cheng Xueyu, Lieutenant Colonel Chen Yanbin, and Huang Fenglin.

    The Burmese side present at the meeting included Chief Representative Brigadier General Aung Gyi, Representatives Brigadier General Kyaw Win, U San Lwin, Senior Colonel Soe Myint, and U Khun Aung Kha.

    Advisors from both the Chinese and Burmese delegations also attended the meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, June 27th: The inaugural ceremony of the Sino-Burmese Joint Boundary Committee was held this afternoon in Rangoon.

    Attending the ceremony were Burmese Foreign Minister Sao Khun Kyi, Chief Representative of the Chinese delegation to the Sino-Burmese Joint Boundary Committee Yao Zhongming, and Chief Representative of the Burmese delegation Brigadier General Aung Gyi.

    Also attending the ceremony were Burmese Chief Justice of the Supreme Court U Myint Thein, Kachin State Affairs Minister Duwa Sinwa Nawng, and former Foreign Minister U Chan Htoon Aung.

    Chinese Ambassador to Burma Li Yimang, as well as diplomatic officials from the Chinese Embassy, also attended the ceremony.

    Speaking at the ceremony, Yao Zhongming, on behalf of the Chinese government, expressed heartfelt congratulations on the establishment of the Sino-Burmese Joint Committee. He said, "The Sino-Burmese boundary issue is a complex problem left over by history. However, because both countries have successively shaken off imperialist oppression and plunder and achieved independence, because the leaders of both countries have an ardent desire to maintain and develop the friendly and cooperative relations between the peoples of the two countries like relatives, and because of the joint efforts of the Chinese government and successive Burmese governments, the two countries finally signed an agreement on border issues in January this year when Burmese former Prime Minister General Ne Win visited Beijing, and also signed a treaty of friendship and non-aggression. This has paved the way for the final and comprehensive settlement of the border issue between the two countries and for the establishment of a peaceful and tranquil border for the peoples of the two countries, bringing the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries into a new stage."

    Yao Zhongming said, "When Premier Zhou Enlai visited Burma in April this year, Prime Minister U Nu further proposed the suggestion that the Sino-Burmese Joint Committee speed up its work so that a Sino-Burmese border treaty could be signed when he visits China in early October this year. Premier Zhou Enlai warmly welcomed and supported this suggestion, and expressed that although the time is short, as long as both sides cooperate closely, it is entirely possible to overcome technical difficulties and complete this task in a timely manner."

    Yao Zhongming said, "We recognize that our task is arduous and time is pressing. However, we believe that, under the guidance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and in the spirit of friendly consultation and mutual understanding and accommodation established by the leaders of the two governments in discussing this issue over the years, we and the Burmese representatives, headed by Brigadier General Aung Gyi, will be able to conduct friendly cooperation and complete the glorious task entrusted to us in a timely and satisfactory manner, and make all necessary preparations for the early signing of the border treaty between the two countries, so as to realize the common aspirations of the governments and peoples of the two countries."

    Yao Zhongming said, "I believe that the smooth completion of our work will not only ensure that the complex and long-pending border issue left over by history between the two countries is finally resolved reasonably, but also make a significant contribution to the development of friendly relations between the two countries in the future, which will further promote the spirit of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence."

    Yao Zhongming finally expressed his heartfelt thanks to the officials of the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and military officials who have given much specific help to enable the meeting of the Joint Committee to proceed smoothly.

    Sao Khun Kyi first made a speech at the ceremony saying, "We all know that the border problem between Burma and China is not a recent one. It is a long-standing problem which could not be solved for more than half a century. The emergence of independent Burma and New China—both eager to promote traditional friendship between the two countries—inevitably made the issue of the not fully demarcated border between the two countries a focus of attention, because such an abnormal situation, if it persists for a long time, could lead to unfortunate incidents which might harm their good relations. Therefore, in the past few years, our two countries, in a friendly spirit and under the guidance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, have been striving to seek a fair and reasonable way to solve this problem."

    Sao Khun Kyi said, "Thanks to the joint efforts of our leaders, Burma and China have for the first time in history found a mutually agreed basis for a comprehensive solution to the border issue and have prepared the conditions for the final and complete demarcation and marking of the Burmese-Chinese border."

    Sao Khun Kyi pointed out, "The task of the Joint Committee is very important, because the final and comprehensive solution to this long-pending problem depends on the successful completion of this task. He said, "I believe that the spirit of friendly understanding and cooperation which has characterized the negotiations of our two governments will permeate the work of the Joint Committee."

    Sao Khun Kyi expressed his conviction that "the Joint Committee will spare no effort to successfully complete its conclusions in the shortest possible time." He said, "The final settlement of the border issue between our two countries will be a lasting monument and a proper tribute not only to the traditional friendship between Burma and China but also to the unchanging reality and dynamic nature of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence which guide the relations between our two countries. There is no doubt that the elimination of this long-standing problem will bring great benefits to both Burma and China, which will usher in a new era of deeper understanding and friendship between the two countries."

    Sao Khun Kyi finally wished the work of the Joint Committee complete success.

    Brigadier General Aung Gyi said in his speech, "Our two countries have reached the advantageous stage of finally resolving our border issues left over from the past. These problems could not be solved by the governments which governed our two countries in the past. Only now will the governments of our two countries finally resolve these issues in the fairest way. Such a fair solution is largely based on the principle of mutual concession."

    Aung Gyi said, "Now, at this meeting, when resolving these outstanding issues in the most sincere and friendly manner, we are always convinced that, by using the lofty principle of mutual love as the guiding principle of our views, these issues will finally be resolved very smoothly to the satisfaction of both parties. At the same time, we must never forget the five basic principles of peaceful coexistence, which are the principles that we jointly follow in the relations between our two countries."

    Aung Gyi extended the warmest welcome to the Chinese delegation in his speech. He quoted a Burmese proverb saying, "Don't let the nourishing hand dry out, the newly blooming flower of friendship must bloom forever." He said, "I believe that this friendship, which will blossom from such close relations, will surely truly benefit the future generations of our two countries."

    Aung Gyi finally expressed that the Burmese side will spare no effort to realize the ardent desire of the Chinese and Burmese governments and peoples to peacefully resolve the border issue.

    中缅边界联合委员会开始工作
    姚仲明说：在五项原则的指导下必能胜利完成任务
    藻昆卓说：友好合作的精神将贯穿在委员会工作中
    新华社仰光28日电　中缅边界联合委员会今天上午开始讨论和拟订有关解决中缅边界的一些具体问题的办法。
    中国方面出席会议的有首席代表姚仲明，代表程之平、成学俞上校、陈雁彬中校和黄凤麟。
    缅甸方面出席会议的有首席代表昂季准将，代表叫温准将、吴山伦、苏敏上校和吴昆翁佳。
    中国和缅甸两国代表团的顾问们也出席了会议。
    新华社仰光27日电　中缅边界联合委员会成立仪式今天下午在仰光举行。
    出席成立仪式的有缅甸外交部长藻昆卓、参加中缅边界联合委员会会议的中国代表团首席代表姚仲明和缅甸代表团首席代表昂季准将。
    出席仪式的还有缅甸最高法院首席法官吴敏登、克钦邦事务部长杜瓦信瓦瑙、前外交部长吴千吞昂。
    中国驻缅甸大使李一氓以及中国大使馆的外交官员们也出席了成立仪式。
    姚仲明在仪式上讲话时，代表中国政府对中缅联合委员会的成立表示衷心的祝贺。他说，“中缅边界问题是一个历史遗留下来的复杂的问题。但是由于两国先后摆脱了帝国主义的压迫和掠夺而取得独立，由于两国领导人具有保持和发展两国人民亲戚般的友好合作关系的热切愿望，由于中国政府和缅甸历届政府的共同努力，两国终于在今年1月间在缅甸前总理奈温将军访问北京的时候签订了关于边界问题的协定，同时还签订了友好和互不侵犯条约。这就为两国最后地、全面地解决边界问题，为两国人民建立一条和平、安谧的边界铺平了道路，使两国之间的友好合作关系进入了新的阶段。”
    姚仲明说，“今年4月间周恩来总理访问缅甸的时候，吴努总理进一步提出建议，希望中缅联合委员会加速工作，以便在他今年10月初访问中国的时候能够签订中缅边界条约。周恩来总理热烈欢迎和支持这个建议，并表示时间虽然短促，但是只要双方密切合作，完全有可能克服技术上的困难，及时完成这项任务。”
    姚仲明说，“我们认识到，我们的任务是繁重的，时间是紧迫的。但是，我们相信，在和平共处五项原则的指导下，本着两国政府领导人多年来商谈这个问题所确立的友好协商态度和互谅互让的精神，我们和以昂季准将为首的缅方代表将能够进行友好的合作，及时而圆满地完成我们所担负的光荣任务，为早日签订两国边界条约作好一切必要的准备，以实现两国政府和两国人民的共同愿望。”
    姚仲明说，“我相信，我们工作的顺利完成将不仅使两国历史上遗留下来的复杂的久悬未决的边界问题最后得到合理解决，而且对今后两国友好关系的发展，也将作出重大贡献，这又将使和平共处五项原则的精神得到进一步的发扬光大。”
    姚仲明最后向给予很多具体帮助、使联合委员会这次会议能够顺利进行的缅甸外交部官员和军部官员表示衷心的感谢。
    藻昆卓首先在仪式上发表讲话说，“我们大家都知道，缅甸和中国之间的边界问题并不是最近发生的问题。这是一个长期存在的、在大半世纪中无法解决的问题。独立的缅甸和新中国——它们都渴望促进两国之间的传统友谊——的出现不可避免地使两国之间没有完全划定的边界的问题成为集中注意的问题，因为这样一种不正常的情况如果长期存在下去，会导致不幸的事件，这种事件可能损害它们的良好关系。因此，在过去几年中，我们两国本着友好的精神、并且在和平共处五项原则的指导下，努力寻求解决这个问题的公平合理的办法。”
    藻昆卓说，“由于我们的领导人的共同努力，缅甸和中国在历史上第一次找到了双方同意的全面解决边界问题的基础，并且为最后和完全划定和标出缅中边界准备了条件。”
    藻昆卓指出，“联合委员会的任务是非常重要的，因为这个长期悬而未决的问题的最后的全面解决取决于这个任务的胜利完成。他说，“我相信，成为我们两国政府的谈判的特点的那种友好谅解和合作的精神将贯穿在联合委员会的工作中。”
    藻昆卓表示确信，“联合委员会将不遗余力地在最短的时间内成功地完成它的结论。”他说，“我们两国边界问题的最后解决，不仅对于缅中两国的传统友谊，而且对于指导我们两国关系的和平共处五项原则的不变的现实和富有活力的性质，将是一个永存的纪念碑和适当的颂赞。毫无疑问，这个长期存在的问题的消除将使缅中两国获得很大的好处，这将揭开两国之间更深的谅解和友谊的新纪元。”
    藻昆卓最后祝联合委员会的工作完全成功。
    昂季准将在讲话中说，“我们两国已经达到了要最后解决过去遗留下来的我们的边界问题这个有利的阶段。这些问题是过去治理我们两国的政府所不能解决的。只有在现在，我们两国政府才将以最公平的办法来最后解决这些问题。这样一种公平的解决办法在很大程度上是以互让的原则为基础的。”
    昂季说，“现在在这次会议上，当以最热诚和友好的态度解决这些悬而未决的问题的时候，我们始终坚信，通过我们以互相友爱的崇高原则作为我们的观点的准绳，这些问题最后将十分顺利地在双方都感到满意的情况下获得解决。同时，时刻也不忘记和平共处的五项基本原则，这些原则是我们在我们两国之间的关系中所共同遵循的。”
    昂季在讲话时向中国代表团致最热诚的欢迎。他援引了缅甸的一则谚语说，“不要使滋润的手干掉，必须让初放的友爱之花永远盛开”。他说，“我相信，将从这样亲切的关系中开出花朵来的这种友爱，肯定会真正造福于我们两国的后代。”
    昂季最后表示，缅甸方面将不遗余力地实现中缅两国政府和人民共同怀有的和平解决边界问题的热烈愿望。
