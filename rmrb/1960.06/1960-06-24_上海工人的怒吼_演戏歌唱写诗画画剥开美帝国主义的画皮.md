Shanghai Workers' Roar
Acting, Singing, Writing Poetry, Painting - Tearing Off the Mask of American Imperialism
By Our Correspondent

The six-story building of the Shanghai Workers' Cultural Palace, standing in the center of Shanghai, roared with anger against American imperialism on the evening of the 21st. More than two thousand workers, just off work, carrying drums, accordions, and pens, gathered here to act, sing, write poetry, compose essays, and paint, tearing off the mask of American imperialism's false peace and strongly condemning the plague god Eisenhower's crimes of aggression.

The war drums thundered, a volley of arrows flew, and the flames of hatred spewed towards the wolf-hearted and dog-lunged American imperialist bandits, burning them, stabbing them, mocking them! In the theater on the ground floor, workers from the Shanghai Cable Factory were performing a crosstalk play: "A Bandit's Travelogue." On the stage, a rat-eyed fellow wearing a black top hat, followed by a slave-like monster, were walking with hesitant steps. At a glance, people knew that this was the warmonger Eisenhower and his lackey on a "bandit's tour" of the Far East. Frightened by the anti-American rage of the people, the lackey suddenly howled, scaring the ugly Ike into a state of panic. "What's that sound?" When the master asked, the lackey was startled and immediately replied, "These are salutes." The artillery fire grew fiercer, and the two wolves kept screaming, "Something's not right!" "This isn't good!" At this moment, a series of strong and resolute roars came from behind the curtain: Ugly Ike get out of Taiwan, fire! Smash the US-Japan military alliance treaty, fire! The two dogs screamed, "God bless us," "Let us return home safely."

This unique crosstalk play was created by Cheng Zhenyuan, a worker at the Shanghai Cable Factory. He and Wang Bin, a trade union cadre from his workshop, collaborated to play Hagerty and Ugly Ike. They heard the audience laughing at them from beginning to end, and said: It's not that we played well, but that these two things are too dirty and too smelly. In recent days, the staff and workers of the Shanghai Cable Factory have created many poems, paintings, and literary programs to counter the aggression of American imperialism, and many staff and workers have also created high-yield and high-quality achievements in production as practical actions to counter the aggressive acts of American imperialism.

In the cultural lounge on the second floor, the Shanghai opera "Blood Debt" was being performed. On the stage, an angry crowd held high the banner of "Down with Kishi Nobusuke" and shouted anti-American imperialist slogans. These were the students marching and demonstrating in the streets of Tokyo, Japan. These patriotic students were subjected to bloody suppression by Kishi Nobusuke, a loyal lackey of American imperialism. Innocent female student Michiko Kanba was killed on the spot. The demonstrating students were even more enraged, and they shouted, "A blood debt must be paid in blood." Many viewers in the audience hated the atrocities of the Japanese and American reactionaries so much that they gnashed their teeth, bringing the whole play to a climax. The staff and workers of the Commercial Bureau No. 1 could not contain their anger after seeing the news of Kishi Nobusuke's bloody suppression of the anti-American struggle of the Japanese people and the murder of female student Michiko Kanba. So everyone created overnight and wrote the script "Blood Debt." In today's performance, they were filled with indignation from beginning to end, reflecting the impassioned anti-American sentiments of the Japanese people. The Michiko Kanba incident has been adapted into scripts, songs, and storytelling by workers and cultural and educational workers in Shanghai and sung in every corner of the city.

The audience, enraged by the crimes of aggression of American imperialism, heard that the Fujian Provincial Staff and Workers' Literary and Art Performance Troupe, which was standing on the front line of the anti-American struggle, had made a special trip to perform, and gave them a long and stormy applause, paying tribute to the heroes. The Third Sister of the famous "Frontline Ten Sisters" and the Little Eighth Route Army from the "Heroic Little Eighth Route Army" participated in the performance. The curtain opened, the vast seaside, the morning sun was shining on the faces of two sentries standing on the rocks. A group of apple-cheeked Young Pioneers were jumping and picking up shells on the beach. Suddenly, a barrage of shells flew over, and a child was sacrificed. The loudspeaker behind the curtain roared with a mountain-shaking roar: The Chiang Kai-shek bandits, supported by American bandits, bombed our peaceful residents, and our army decided to give the heinous enemy a severe punishment. This was August 23, 1958. No sooner said than done, streaks of red light flickered on the blue sky curtain, and the entire audience, sitting and standing, kept applauding vigorously, as if this was not applause, but our army's artillery shells giving a devastating blow to American imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. In the sound of artillery fire, the frontline militia, the Frontline Ten Sisters, and the children all joined this great struggle, some delivering water, some transporting ammunition, and some standing guard, sharing the same hatred and enemy. It made the audience feel that they were not in the theater, but on the front line, not watching a performance, but personally participating in the battle. All this fully demonstrates the powerful strength of the Chinese people to defend world peace and resolutely liberate Taiwan.

In the poetry, painting, and essay competitions, the drums reverberated, accompanying the workers' recitation of poems. It was truly "a poem, an artillery shell," and every sentence hit the key points of American imperialism.

Listen, this is what Zhang Guanglei, a young worker from the August 1st Film Machinery Factory, wrote on the spot: "Beat the Bandit!"

"Welcome" the Plague God
The cannons laugh heartily
Generous gifts are prepared --
Fire!
The divine cannons fire well
The "peace" mask falls off
Ike reveals his true colors --
Bandit!
The Eastern dragon dances
The sea stirs up waves
The "Plague God" dares to come again --
No escape!

The poems, sentence by sentence, stripped off Eisenhower's true colors; the drums, beat after beat, made this plague god lose his soul, and every time a poem was finished, the entire audience immediately burst into warm applause.

The poems and paintings hanging on the walls around the venue were all exposing and satirizing the aggressive crimes of American imperialism. The cartoon "Ugly Ike's Far East Trip Trilogy," composed of three frowning Eisenhower faces, depicted the plague god taking a plane, being hit by stones, and lying down, and labeled them with three subtitles: "Bad Guy!" "Get Out!" "Finished!" exposing the inevitable fate of this plague god. This painting was created by Fei Fuquan, a staff member of the Shanghai Railway Bureau. The Shanghai Railway Bureau has two or three hundred amateur art workers in the Shanghai area. In the first two days of the "Anti-American Aggression, Resolutely Liberate Taiwan, and Defend World Peace Propaganda Week," they had already painted more than 100 propaganda paintings and cartoons against the United States, which were exhibited on the walls of the Railway Bureau Building. Six of their employees participated in the poetry, painting, and essay competitions, painting fifteen cartoons on the spot.

The essay "Mad Dogs Don't Turn Into Sheep," written by Zhou Baolin, a worker at the Qiuxin Shipyard, with nearly a thousand words, succinctly revealed the nature of imperialism. Zhou Baolin is a member of the Qiuxin Shipyard philosophy group, which is known throughout the country for workers studying theory. When "Mad Dogs Don't Turn Into Sheep" was read out at the meeting, it was unanimously praised by the audience. The skit "The Last Days of Wolves and Dogs," recitation of "Full of Evil Deeds, Meeting Death," a combination of national musical instruments, orchestral music "Anti-American Demonstration Medley," pantomime "Bombing Jinmen," and Pingtan, magic, and performing singing performed at the meeting tonight were also warmly welcomed by the people. The staff and workers also expressed that they must carry out a more extensive and in-depth anti-American struggle after returning to the factory, and use more production good news to combat American imperialism.

    上海工人的怒吼
    演戏歌唱写诗画画剥开美帝国主义的画皮
    本报记者
    屹立在上海市中心的工人文化宫六层大厦，21日晚上发出了反对美帝侵略的怒吼。两千多刚下班的工人，携带着鼓、手风琴和笔，汇集到这里来演戏、唱歌、写诗、作文、画画，剥开了美帝国主义假和平的画皮，强烈地谴责了瘟神艾森豪威尔的侵略罪行。
    战鼓轰鸣，万弩俱发，仇恨的火焰向狼心狗肺的美帝国主义强盗喷射，烧它，刺它，嘲笑它！在底层的剧场里，上海电缆厂的工人正在演出相声剧：“强盗旅行记”。只见舞台上一个头戴黑色高帽的鼠眉贼眼的家伙，同一个奴才似的怪物，一前一后一步一探地在走。一看人们便知道这是战争贩子艾森豪威尔和他的哈巴狗随从正在作远东的“强盗旅行”。被人民的反美怒潮吓怕了的哈巴狗忽然嚎叫起来，吓得丑艾克心惊肉跳。“什么声音？”哈巴狗见主子一问，吓了一跳，随即答道：“这是礼炮。”炮火越来越猛，这两只狼狗不断惊叫起来：“不对！”“不好！”这时幕后发出阵阵刚强、果决的吼声：丑艾克滚出台湾去，开炮！粉碎美日军事同盟条约，开炮！两只狗东西吓得哇啦哇啦喊：“上帝保佑”，“让我们平安回到老家。”
    这个别开生面的相声剧，是上海电缆厂工人程振远创作的。他和自己车间的工会干部王彬合作扮演了哈格蒂和丑艾克，他们听见观众自始至终的嘲笑声，说：不是我们扮演得好，是这两个东西实在太肮脏，太臭。近几天来，上海电缆厂的职工们创作了许许多多反击美帝国主义侵略的诗画和文艺节目，不少职工还在生产上创造了高产优质成绩作为反击美国帝国主义侵略行为的实际行动。
    在二楼的文化休息厅里，正演着沪剧“血债”。舞台上愤怒的人群高举着“打倒岸信介”的旗子，高呼反对美帝国主义口号，这是在日本东京街头游行示威的学生，这些爱国的学生遭到了美帝国主义的忠实走狗岸信介的血腥镇压。无辜的女学生桦美智子当场被杀害。示威学生更加怒火冲天，他们高呼着“血债要用血来还”，台下的许多观众对日美反动派的暴行恨得咬牙切齿，使全剧达到了最高潮。演出这出戏的商业一局的职工们，在看到岸信介血腥镇压日本人民的反美斗争和女学生桦美智子被害的消息后，怎么也抑制不住心头的愤怒，于是大家连夜进行了创作，写出了剧本“血债”。在今天的演出中，他们自始至终地充满了激愤的心情，把日本人民慷慨激昂的反美情绪反映了出来。桦美智子事件已被上海的工人，文教工作者编成了剧本，写成了歌曲、说唱等，在上海全市各个角落演唱。
    被美帝国主义侵略罪行激怒的观众听说站在反美斗争前哨的福建省的职工文艺会演代表团特地赶来演出，报以长时间的暴风雨般的掌声。向英雄们致敬。著名的“前沿十姐妹”中的三姐和“英雄小八路”中的小八路都参加演出。幕启，辽阔的海边，朝阳正辉映着两个屹立在岩石上的哨兵的脸。一群苹果脸蛋的红领巾在海滩中欢跳，捡贝壳。忽然飞来一阵炮弹，一个孩子牺牲了。幕后扩音器里传出震撼山岳的怒吼：美国强盗支持下的蒋匪军向我和平居民轰击，我军决定给万恶的敌人以严厉惩罚。这是1958年的8月23日。说时迟，那时快，蓝天的幕布上，一道道红光闪耀不停，全场观众，坐着的，站着的，不住使劲鼓掌，仿佛这不是掌声，而是我军对美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石匪帮以歼灭性打击的炮弹。炮火声中，只见前线民兵、前沿十姐妹以及孩子，都投入这个伟大的斗争中去，有的送水，有的运炮弹，有的放哨，敌忾同仇。使观众感到不是在剧场，而是在前线，不是在看演出，而是亲身参加了战斗。所有这些，充分显示了中国人民保卫世界和平、坚决解放台湾的强大力量。
    赛诗、赛画、赛文场里，震荡回响的大鼓冬冬地伴着工人朗诵诗篇。真是“一句诗，一颗炮弹”，句句击中了美帝国主义的要害。
    听吧，这是八一电影机械厂的青年职工张广雷即席写的：“打强盗！”
    “欢迎”瘟神到
    大炮哈哈笑
    厚礼准备齐——
    开炮！
    神炮打得好
    “和平”假帽掉
    艾克现原形——
    强盗！
    东方巨龙舞
    大海掀浪涛
    “瘟神”敢再来——
    难逃！
    诗，一句一句剥出了艾森豪威尔的原形；鼓，一声一声打得这个瘟神失魂落魄，当每一诗篇朗诵结束的时候，全场立即报以热烈的掌声。
    挂满在场子四周墙壁上的诗篇和画幅，全部是揭露和讽刺美帝国主义的侵略罪行的。由三张愁眉苦脸的艾森豪威尔脸谱组成的漫画“丑艾克远东之行三部曲”，作者描绘瘟神乘飞机、挨石块、躺下了三个画面，并且给它标上三个小题：“坏蛋！”“滚蛋！”
  “完蛋！”把这个瘟神必然的命运揭露得淋漓尽致。这幅画是上海铁路总局的职工费富泉创作的。上海铁路总局在上海地区就有业余美术工作者二、三百人，他们在“反对美帝侵略、坚决解放台湾、保卫世界和平宣传周”的头两天，已画了一百多幅反美斗争的宣传画和漫画，展出在铁路局大厦的墙壁上，在赛诗、赛画、赛文场里，他们有六个职工参加，当场画出十五幅漫画。
    求新造船厂工人周宝林写的一篇近千字的杂文“疯狗不会变绵羊”，把帝国主义的本性一语道破了。周宝林是以工人学理论闻名全国的求新造船厂哲学小组的成员。“疯狗不会变绵羊”在会上宣读时，受到全场一致赞扬。今晚在会上演出的活报“狼和狗的末日”，朗诵“恶贯满盈、死到临头”，民族乐器合奏、管弦乐“反美示威大联奏”、哑剧“炮轰金门”和评弹、魔术、表演唱……也受到人们热烈的欢迎，职工们还表示回到工厂后一定要更广泛深入地开展反美斗争，以更多的生产捷报来打击美帝国主义。（附图片）
