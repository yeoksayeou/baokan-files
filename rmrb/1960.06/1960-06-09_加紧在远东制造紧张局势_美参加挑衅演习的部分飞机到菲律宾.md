Xinhua News Agency, Manila, June 5th: Fifteen of the one hundred and twenty military aircraft dispatched by the United States to Southeast Asia for provocative "exercises" arrived at the U.S. Air Force base in Clark, Philippines, this morning from Okinawa.

This is one of a series of actions by the United States to intensify tensions in the Far East after sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference. Sources say that this "exercise" is also to coordinate with Eisenhower's upcoming conspiratorial activities in Asia.

According to a U.S. Air Force spokesman, these aircraft will fly to Bangkok on the 6th, where they will "exercise" for three days before flying back to Clark Air Base. He also said that another batch of aircraft would fly directly from Okinawa to Taiwan.

It is reported that this "Air Force Composite Strike Team," composed of one hundred and twenty U.S. fighter planes, reconnaissance planes, and other military aircraft, will conduct so-called "training exercises" separately in the Philippines, Thailand, and Taiwan.

    加紧在远东制造紧张局势
    美参加挑衅演习的部分飞机到菲律宾
    新华社5日讯　马尼拉消息：美国派遣到东南亚进行挑衅性“演习”的一百二十架军用飞机中的十五架，已经在今天上午从冲绳到达菲律宾克拉克的美国空军基地。
    这是美国在破坏四国首脑会议以后加紧在远东制造紧张局势的一系列行动之一。有消息说，这次“演习”还是为了配合艾森豪威尔即将到亚洲进行阴谋活动。
    据美国空军发言人说，这批飞机将在6日飞往曼谷，在那里“演习”三天以后再飞返克拉克基地。他又说，另外一批飞机将直接从冲绳飞往台湾。
    据报道，这批由一百二十架美国战斗机、侦察机和其他军用飞机组成的“空军混合突击队”将分别在菲律宾、泰国、台湾进行所谓“训练演习”。
