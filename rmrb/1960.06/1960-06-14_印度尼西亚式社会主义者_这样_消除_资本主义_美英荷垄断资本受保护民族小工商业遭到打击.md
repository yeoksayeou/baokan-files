Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 9th. Sakirman, a member of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party, published an article in the Indonesian "People's Daily" today entitled "A New Way to Protect Foreign Investment," criticizing certain people who verbally claim to "eliminate" capitalism but in reality protect large foreign capital groups.

Sakirman said that among those who support "Indonesian-style socialism," there is a type of person who believes that it is now necessary to "eliminate" capitalism and immediately realize "socialism." The capitalism they are referring to is actually the small-scale production system in Indonesia, the system of shops and small industries owned by Indonesia's small national capitalists. The "anti-capitalist" measures they demand to be taken quickly involve "nationalizing and socializing" the small manufacturing and small shops in Indonesia. However, they remain silent about the American, British, and Dutch monopoly capital with modern technology and equipment in the oil fields and plantations. They do not consider foreign capital giants such as Mobil Oil, Texaco, and Shell, as well as landlords, to be the most dangerous enemies of Indonesia's national security and prosperity.

Sakirman pointed out that this kind of action is very dangerous. It actually protects the real enemies of the people while attacking the people's strength. Because this action will divide the forces of revolution and construction, making it impossible to unite millions of small manufacturers, shopkeepers, and small business owners in a united front to thoroughly defeat the main enemies of the revolution – imperialism, colonialism, feudalism, and their running dogs. Sakirman pointed out that such "anti-imperialist" cries are actually a new guise for protecting foreign capital investment.

### “印度尼西亚式社会主义者”这样“消除”资本主义  美英荷垄断资本受保护民族小工商业遭到打击

    “印度尼西亚式社会主义者”这样“消除”资本主义
    美英荷垄断资本受保护民族小工商业遭到打击
    新华社雅加达9日电　印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会委员萨基尔曼今天在印度尼西亚“人民日报”上发表一篇题为“保护外国投资的一个新办法”的文章，批评某些在口头上说要“消除”资本主义而在实际上却保护外国大资本集团的人。
    萨基尔曼说，在那些支持“印度尼西亚式的社会主义”的人当中，有一种人认为，现在必须“消除”资本主义，而应该一下子实现“社会主义”。他们所说的资本主义，实际上是印度尼西亚的小规模生产体系，为印度尼西亚的小民族资本家所拥有的商店和小工业的体系。他们要求迅速采取的“反对资本主义”的措施，是要把印度尼西亚国家中的小制造业和小商店“国有化和社会化”。但是，他们对在油田和种植园中拥有现代技术装备的美国、英国和荷兰的垄断资本却保持沉默。他们并不认为，如美孚油公司、德士古石油公司和壳牌石油公司这些外国大资本以及地主是印度尼西亚国家安全和繁荣的最危险的敌人。
    萨基尔曼指出，这种行动是非常危险的。它实际上是保护人民的真正敌人，而打击人民的力量。因为，这种行动将分裂革命和建设力量，使它不能把千百万小制造商、店主和小店主团结在一个统一战线之中以彻底打击革命的主要敌人——帝国主义、殖民主义、封建主义和它们的走狗。萨基尔曼指出，这样的“反对帝国主义”叫嚷实际上是保护外国大资本投资的新外衣。
