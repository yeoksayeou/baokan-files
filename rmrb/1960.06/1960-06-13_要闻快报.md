　　Innovation Spearhead Aimed at Increasing Production and Saving Raw Materials
　　The broad masses of workers on the industrial front in Zhejiang Province are concentrating the main direction of the technical revolution on increasing production and saving raw and processed materials, and are vigorously carrying out a mass movement to comprehensively increase production and save raw and processed materials, centering on coal and iron. This movement is currently developing rapidly in four aspects: tapping equipment potential and doing everything possible to increase production; practicing strict economy, using one portion of material to serve as several; developing diversified operations and comprehensive utilization, opening up new sources of raw and processed materials; and vigorously running "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups" to develop the production of raw and processed materials.

　　Incorporating Technical Innovation Achievements into Product Design
　　Harbin No. 1 Machine Manufacturing Plant is concentrating the innovation achievements of the user departments, design departments, and manufacturing departments to carry out a major revolution in product design. So far, the plant has carried out 2,900 reforms on two products, excavators and crawler cranes, and simplified 476 unnecessary parts. After the reform of the "Swan" brand excavator, the number of parts was reduced by 460, but the excavation capacity was increased by 25%. It can also be used to replace heavy cranes, with a lifting capacity of up to 20 tons each time. After the crawler crane was reformed, the number of parts was reduced by one-third, and the total weight of the body was reduced from the originally designed 21.5 tons to 17 tons, and the lifting capacity was increased from 8 tons to 10 tons. After the reform of these two products, the entire plant can save more than 1,500 tons of steel and more than 10,000 meters of steel wire rope per year.

　　Dalian Shipyard Saves Materials to Build More Ships
　　Dalian Shipyard, with the spirit of continuous revolution, insists on carrying out a regular mass movement of product design revolution and process revolution. Since the beginning of this year, through process and design revolutions and the adoption of new technologies, more than 2,000 tons of materials such as steel, iron, and copper have been saved. Since May 25, the entire plant has launched a new upsurge of a mass "material grabbing" campaign, carrying out a "complete transformation" design revolution on five products including cargo ships, cargo barges, and fishing barges. At present, a new design has been created to build two fishing barges with the materials for one fishing barge.

　　Five Levels of Cadres Meet at the Furnace
　　Leading cadres of relevant departments in Hebei Province, Tianjin Municipality, Hedong District, and Tianjin No. 2 Steel Plant, together with the leading cadres and workshop cadres of the plant, met at the furnace to vigorously carry out a one-stop "experimental field" centered on improving the lifespan of converters, doing everything possible to break through the key to improving steel production. Because the five levels of leading cadres went deep into the furnace front, it was easy to discover and solve problems in a timely manner, and the production of the entire plant was thriving. The steel output on the 6th increased by 16% compared with the 5th, and on the 8th it increased by 41% compared with the 6th. The average lifespan of the converter increased by 38% compared with May.

    要闻快报
    革新矛头指向增产节约原材料
    浙江省工业战线广大职工把技术革命主攻方向集中到增产节约原料材料方面，正在蓬勃开展以煤铁为中心的全面增产节约原料材料的群众运动。这个运动目前正向着四个方面迅猛发展：挖掘设备潜力，千方百计搞增产；厉行节约，一份材料顶几份材料使用；发展多种经营、综合利用，开辟原料材料新来源；大办“小土群”、“小洋群”，发展原料材料生产。
    把技术革新成果纳入产品设计
    哈尔滨第一机器制造厂集中使用部门、设计部门和制造部门的革新成果，进行产品设计大革命。到目前为止，这个厂已经在挖掘机、履带吊车两种产品上，进行了二千九百多项改革，简化了四百七十六个不必要的部件。“天鹅”牌挖掘机改革后，部件比原来减少了四百六十个，挖掘能力却提高了25％。它还可以代替重型吊车使用，每次吊装能力可达二十吨。履带吊车改革后，部件比原来减少三分之一，机身总重量由原设计的二十一点五吨减少到十七吨，吊装能力由八吨提高到十吨。这两种产品经过改革之后，全厂一年就可以节约一千五百多吨钢铁和一万多米钢丝绳。
    大连造船厂节约材料多造船
    大连造船厂以不断革命的精神，坚持开展经常性的产品设计革命和工艺革命的群众运动。今年以来，通过工艺、设计革命和采用新技术，节约了钢、铁、铜等材料二千多吨。从5月25日开始，全厂又掀起了群众性夺材大战新高潮，在货轮、货驳船、渔驳船等五种产品上，展开了“脱胎换骨”的设计革命，目前已经创造出一种用一条渔驳船的材料造两条渔驳船的新设计。
      五级干部会师炉前
    河北省、天津市、河东区有关部门的领导干部和天津第二钢厂的领导干部、车间干部在炉前会师，同职工一起大搞以提高转炉炉龄为中心的一条龙“试验田”，千方百计突破影响钢产量提高的关键。由于五级领导干部深入炉前，便于及时发现问题，解决问题，全厂生产蒸蒸日上。6日钢产量比5日提高16％，8日又比6日提高41％，转炉炉龄平均比5月份提高38％。
