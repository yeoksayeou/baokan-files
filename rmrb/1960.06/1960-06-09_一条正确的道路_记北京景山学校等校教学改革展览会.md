A Correct Path
——On the Beijing Jingshan School and Other Schools' Teaching Reform Exhibition
By Our Reporter

During the National Conference of Outstanding Individuals in Culture and Education, the joint teaching reform exhibition held by Beijing Jingshan School and the Experimental School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University opened. This exhibition uses vivid facts to tell people: teaching must be reformed, and new things are invincible!

An Exhibition Declaring War on Bourgeois Educational Thought

This exhibition is not very large, only four classrooms in total. However, people can see from here a struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eradicate bourgeois ideology that is currently taking place in the field of education in our country. Bourgeois educators once asserted that education cannot meet the needs of national construction and cannot achieve great, rapid, good, and economical results or a leap forward. One of their theories is the so-called "principle of measuring ability," which says that if teaching is fast, efficient, and economical, it is "against the will of nature (or God)"; they also emphasize the particularity of education, saying that the ancient curriculum system established by the bourgeoisie, despite being far removed from the level of modern scientific development and the needs of our country's production and construction, is immutable and untouchable. This small exhibition, however, uses exciting facts to sharply criticize these bourgeois ideas and bourgeois educational theories. This is an exhibition that declares war on the bourgeoisie. From every chart, photo, and piece of student work in the exhibition, people can see and hear revolutionary new things shouting and striving to open up a path forward for themselves.

Beijing Jingshan School and the Experimental School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University began experimenting with the nine-year consistent system teaching reform plan proposed by Beijing Normal University in March of this year. The current school system is twelve years, totaling 10,620 hours; implementing the nine-year consistent system uses a total of 8,678 hours to reach the current level of a first-year university student. This fact definitely tells people: not only can teaching be great, fast, good, and economical, but teaching reform will write a glorious page in the history of education in our country.

A Revolution in the Mathematics Teaching System

The nine-year consistent system teaching reform plan mainly involves a fundamental reform of mathematics teaching. The mathematics reform plan not only aims to enable students to learn useful mathematical knowledge in nine years that they used to learn in twelve years, but also to adapt to the needs of scientific and technological development. It also aims to enable students to learn higher mathematics content such as analytic geometry, calculus, probability theory, mathematical statistics, and drafting, greatly improving students' ability to use mathematical knowledge to solve practical problems. Why can the new plan achieve this? This is because the new plan, in accordance with the viewpoint of dialectical materialism, uses the achievements of modern mathematics, boldly breaks the old, backward, isolated, fragmented, repetitive, and cumbersome old mathematics teaching system, especially the Euclidean geometry axiom system, and establishes a new scientific mathematics teaching system based on functions, combining numbers and shapes, and unifying concepts and calculations.

Can the new plan be accepted by students? Please see:

Children in the experimental class at Jingshan School who started school at the age of six are doing algebra exercises. Among the 45 of them, 38 have mastered calculation methods such as X+8=12 X=12-8=4; students in the second-grade experimental class are drawing triangles, and they have begun to learn elementary geometry knowledge; third-grade students have already grasped the preliminary concept of functions, and look at how clearly and correctly they answer their homework and test papers; fifth-grade students can already use algebraic equations to solve application problems. They do it quickly and correctly. Second-year high school students at the Experimental School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University are also fully capable of learning higher mathematics. Currently, 95% of the students in the class can independently complete analytic geometry exercises. In the teaching reform experiment, the adoption of new teaching materials and new teaching methods has stimulated students' interest and enthusiasm for learning. After mastering this knowledge, students apply it in their daily lives. They use the principle of similar figures to measure the height of trees, houses, or electric lights at any time. One student doubted the accuracy of this measurement and actually climbed the tree to verify it. When he found that the results measured on the ground and on the tree were the same, he was so happy that he had obtained this simple method of measuring height. These achievements, although only a beginning, have attracted the attention of all visitors. Yes, not only in mathematics teaching, but also in physics and chemistry teaching, and in the entire education cause, we must surpass all capitalist countries.

Quickly Master the Language Tool

In the Chinese language teaching exhibition, we also saw the bankruptcy of the bourgeois education's "principle of measuring ability." In Chinese language teaching, first learn Pinyin, use Pinyin as a crutch, learn a large number of characters, and strive to break through the character recognition barrier in one to two years, be able to independently read children's publications, and be able to write short articles. Combine character recognition with reading and writing, combine classroom learning with extracurricular practice, and combine writing with production labor and social practice. This enables children to master and use the beautiful language of the motherland more quickly, and also enables children to receive communist ideological education in Chinese language teaching. The teachers of Jingshan School and the Experimental School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University adopted new Chinese language teaching methods for the experimental classes, giving play to children's initiative. In just over two months, the children learned a large number of new characters, and some children wrote very good short articles. Please see: In an essay titled "What I Will Do When I Grow Up," Lu Guangyi, a six-year-old first-grade child at the Experimental School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University, wrote: "I will be a soldier in the People's Liberation Army when I grow up. I will carry a gun and stand on the border of the motherland to defend the motherland. If the imperialists come, I will shoot them dead. If they hit me, I will blow them up with grenades and make contributions to the motherland." Du Fan, a six-and-a-half-year-old first-grade student at Jingshan School, wrote the following letter to Chairman Mao two months after learning Chinese:

Chairman Mao, we love you
We all listen to you
We must study hard
No talking in class
No fighting after class
Love reading, love labor,
When we grow up, we will be workers and peasants.
These essays and letters are not only written in neat handwriting, but also in clear, vivid, and thoughtful prose. In ancient times, there was a good story of a seven-year-old prodigy writing poetry. In today's era of Mao Zedong, what is so strange about this? Aren't the many wonderful short articles and heartfelt and vivid poems displayed at the exhibition the masterpieces of six- and seven-year-old children? These seedlings, as soon as they master the written language, are good at using this tool to promote their own daily progress. Second-grade students at Jingshan School's elementary school started a wall newspaper named "Star Torch." Posted on the wall newspaper are short articles they wrote very carefully in pencil. Some praise good people and good deeds; some guarantee to be good children; some express their determination to overcome their shortcomings...

At the exhibition, many visitors listened to the recordings of children learning foreign languages over and over again. Children at Jingshan School begin learning foreign languages from the first grade. Some classes learn Russian, some learn English, some learn German, and some learn French or Spanish. It is a bold experiment for children to learn foreign languages. However, some children have learned seventy or eighty words and short sentences in twenty class hours. The recordings broadcast children singing Russian songs, children reciting short English poems, simple German conversations among students, and French questions and answers between teachers and students in the classroom. What reason is there not to believe that these children can learn a foreign language well in nine years of middle school! Perhaps some people will raise such a question: "Why learn so many foreign languages from a young age?" The exhibition quoted a saying from Marx: "Foreign language is a weapon in the struggle of life." This is the best answer!

Cultivate the Habit of Taking Labor as the First Need of Life

The combination of education and productive labor is the communist direction for cultivating the new generation. After the teaching reform in Jingshan School and the Experimental School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University, labor has begun to be institutionalized and has increased by 5% to 15% compared to before. In this exhibition, we can see these distinct slogans: "Labor every day, labor from a young age"; "There is no distinction between high and low in labor"; "Physical labor is the most valuable"; "Actively participate in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement." Look at how earnestly the children in the experimental class are wiping glass and wiping tables and chairs, and how interested they are in watering vegetables. Labor is the foundation of our education. The pictures in the exhibition vividly show that labor makes people smarter, labor makes people healthier, and labor raises awareness. Cultivating children's labor habits from an early age, making them regard physical labor as the first need of life from an early age, and cultivating them from an early age to become well-rounded new people who combine physical and mental labor, so that this generation of children can combine mental and physical labor well under our education system. Isn't this actively preparing conditions for the transition to communism in the future? Marx said: "This kind of education combines productive labor with intellectual, physical, and moral education for every child who has reached a certain age. This is not only a method of increasing social production, but also the only method of cultivating well-rounded human beings." This ideal is becoming a glorious reality.

Teaching Reform Must Be Led by the Party

Teaching reform is a profound revolution, and it is impossible to do well without the leadership of the Party. Strengthening the leadership of the Party and adhering to putting politics in command are the fundamental guarantees for doing a good job in teaching reform. The last part of the exhibition allows us to see how Jingshan School and other schools are carrying out teaching reform under the leadership of the Party.

In the teaching reform, the Party organizations of Jingshan School and other schools resolutely rely on teachers who support teaching reform, strive to unite those who basically support teaching reform but still have some doubts, eliminate their doubts, help them clear their minds, and raise their awareness; and adopt methods such as collective lesson preparation, observation and teaching, and further study to help them improve their professional level and overcome difficulties in teaching, so that they can dispel their doubts, put down their ideological burdens, and devote themselves to teaching reform with a happy mood. Now, most teachers are determined to do what the Party has instructed under the leadership of the Party: appropriately shorten the duration of schooling, appropriately increase the level of study, appropriately control class hours, and appropriately increase labor. Combine experienced teachers with less experienced teachers, and combine teachers with new experience with teachers with old experience. Under the leadership of the Party, the vast number of teachers have fully developed the communist spirit of cooperation and are actively carrying out teaching reform.

People who come out of the exhibition have a common feeling: This is an exhibition with a clear direction. They are taking a correct path. Although this teaching reform experiment has only just begun, although the specific experience is not yet mature, and some new problems and difficulties will continue to arise. But what new things in the world are perfect from the moment they are born? The important thing is that they dare to revolutionize, which is a very valuable spirit. We sincerely wish this revolutionary seedling to grow strong, blossom, and bear fruit under the rain and dew of Mao Zedong Thought! (Attached pictures)

    一条正确的道路
    ——记北京景山学校等校教学改革展览会
    本报记者
    在全国文教群英会期间，北京景山学校和北京师范大学附属实验学校联合举办的教学改革展览会开幕了。这个展览会用活生生的事实告诉人们：教学必须改革，新生事物不可战胜！
    一个向资产阶级教育思想宣战的展览会
    这个展览会并不很大，一共只有四间教室。但是人们却从这里看到了目前正在我国教育领域里进行的一场兴无灭资的斗争。资产阶级的教育学家们，曾经断言教育是不能配合国家建设的需要，不能多快好省、实现跃进的。他们的理论中有一条所谓“量力性原则”，说什么教学如果多快好省，那是“违反自然（或者上帝）的意志”的；他们又强调教育的特殊性，说什么资产阶级所建立的古老的课程体系，尽管远远地脱离了现代科学发展的水平和我国生产建设的需要，却是万世不变，动不得的。这个小小的展览会，却用激动人心的事实，对这些资产阶级思想、资产阶级教育理论进行了尖锐的批判。这是一个向资产阶级宣战的展览会。从展览会上的每一张图表照片、每一件学生作业中，人们都可以看到、听到革命的新生事物，在大喊大嚷，奋力为自己开辟前进的道路。
    北京景山学校、北京师大附属实验学校，从今年3月开始，按照北京师范大学提出的九年一贯制的教学改革方案进行试验，现行学制是十二年，共一万零六百二十学时；实行九年一贯制共用八千六百七十八学时就达到目前大学一年级的水平。这个事实肯定地告诉人们：教学不仅能够多快好省，而且教学改革将为我国教育史写下光辉灿烂的一页。
    数学教学体系的革命
    九年一贯制教学改革方案中主要是对数学教学进行了根本的改革。数学改革方案不但要在九年的时间内，使学生学到过去十二年所学到的有用的数学知识，而且适应科学技术发展的需要，还要使学生学到解析几何、微积分、概率论、数理统计和制图学等高等数学的内容，大大提高学生运用数学知识解决实际问题的能力。新的方案为什么能做到这一点呢？这是因为新方案按照辩证唯物主义的观点，利用近代数学的成就，大胆地打破了陈旧落后、孤立、割裂、重复、繁琐的旧的数学教学体系，特别是其中的欧几里德几何公理体系，建立起以函数为纲、数形结合，概念与计算统一的新的科学的数学教学体系。
    新方案能不能为学生所接受呢？请看：
    景山学校六岁入学的实验班儿童们在作代数习题，他们四十五人中，有三十八人已掌握了X＋8＝12　X＝12－8＝4的这类计算方法；二年级实验班的学生正在画三角形，他们已开始学初级的几何知识了；三年级学生就已经掌握了函数的初步概念，看他们的作业和试卷解答得多么清楚、正确；五年级学生已能运用代数方程解应用题了。他们做的又快又正确。师大附属实验学校高中二年级的学生也完全能学高等数学。现在全班95％的学生能独立完成解析几何习题。在教学改革试验中，由于采用新教材、新教法，启发了学生的兴趣和学习积极性。学生们掌握了这些知识后，在日常生活中就应用起来。他们利用相似形原理，随时测量树木、房屋或电灯的高度。有一个学生怀疑这样测量的准确性，竟爬上树去核验，当他发现在地上和在树上测量的结果是一样时，他多么高兴自己已获得了这种简便的测量高度的方法。这些成绩，虽然还只是开始，但它们已引起了所有参观者的重视。是的，不仅在数学教学上，而且在物理、化学教学上，在整个教育事业上，我们都要超过一切资本主义国家。
    迅速掌握语文工具
    在语文教学展览中，我们同样看到资产阶级教育学“量力性”原则的破产。在语文教学上，先学好拼音，以拼音做拐杖，大量识字，争取用一年到两年的时间突破识字关，能独立阅读少年儿童读物，能写短文。又把识字和阅读、作文结合起来，把课内学习和课外练习结合起来，把写作和生产劳动、社会实践结合起来。这就使得儿童能更快地掌握和运用祖国的优美文字，同时也在语文教学中使儿童受到共产主义的思想教育。景山学校和北京师大附属实验学校的教师，对实验班采用新的语文教学方法，发挥儿童主动性，两个多月，儿童们就学会了大量的生字，有的儿童写出了很好的短文。请看：在以“我长大了作什么”为题的作文中，北京师大附属实验学校一年级六岁儿童陆光义这样写道：“我长大了当解放军。我背着枪，站在祖国的边疆，保卫祖国。帝国主义来了，我就用枪打死他。他要是打我，我就用手榴弹炸死他们，为祖国立功劳”。景山学校小学一年级的六岁半儿童杜凡，学习语文两个月后，给毛主席写了下面的信：
    毛主席，我们爱您
    我们都听您的话
    我们一定要努力学习
    上课不讲话
    下课不打架
    爱读书，爱劳动，
    长大了，当工农。这些作文和信，不仅写的字迹端正，而且文笔清晰、生动，有思想性。古人曾有七岁神童作诗的佳话，在今天毛泽东时代的儿童中，这有什么奇怪的呢？展览会上陈列的许多精彩的短文和感情真挚的生动的诗篇，不都是六、七岁儿童的杰作么？这些像嫩苗一样的幼儿，一开始掌握文字，就善于运用这个工具来促进自己天天向上。景山学校小学二年级学生办起了命名为“星星火炬”的墙报。墙报上张贴着他们用铅笔写得十分工整的短文。有的表扬好人好事；有的保证做一个好孩子；有的表示决心克服自己的缺点……。
    在展览会上，许多参观者一遍又一遍地听着录音机放送儿童们学外语的录音。景山学校的儿童从一年级开始就学外语了。有的班学俄语，有的班学英语，有的班学德语，还有的班学法语或西班牙语。儿童学外语，这是一个大胆的试验。但是，有些孩子们在二十课时内，就学会七、八十个单词和短句了。录音机放送着孩子们唱的俄文歌，孩子们朗诵短小的英文诗；在同学中进行简单的德语会话，以及师生在课堂上的法语问答。有什么理由不相信这群孩子们能在九年中学好一种外国语呢！也许有人会提出这样的疑问：“从小学习那么多的外语干什么？”展览会上引马克思的一句话说得好：“外国语是人生斗争的一种武器。”这就是最好的回答！
    培养把劳动当作生活的第一需要的习惯
    教育与生产劳动相结合，是培养新的一代的共产主义方向。景山学校和师大附属实验学校教学改革以后，劳动已经开始形成制度，而且比以前增加了5％到15％。在这个展览会上，我们可以看到这样几条鲜明的标语：“天天劳动，从小劳动”；“劳动没有高低贵贱之分”；“体力劳动最可宝贵的”；“积极参加技术革新和技术革命运动。”看，实验班的儿童们多么认真地在擦玻璃，抹桌椅，他们对浇菜多么感兴趣。劳动是我们教育的基础。展览会上的图片，生动地表现出：劳动使人聪明，劳动使人健康，劳动提高觉悟。从小养成儿童的劳动习惯，从小使他们把体力劳动当作生活的第一需要，从小培养他们成为体力劳动和脑力劳动相结合的全面发展的新人，使这一代的儿童在我们的教育制度下把脑力劳动和体力劳动很好地结合起来。这不正是为着在将来过渡到共产主义而积极准备条件么？马克思说过：“这种教育使每一个已达一定年龄的儿童，都把生产劳动和智育、体育、德育结合起来，这不仅是增加社会生产的一个方法，并且是培养全面发展的人类的唯一方法。”这种理想正在成为光辉的现实。
    教学改革必须要由党来领导
    教学改革是一场深刻的革命，没有党的领导是绝不可能作好的。加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，是做好教学改革工作的根本保证。展览会的最后一部分使我们看见了景山学校等校是如何在党的领导下进行教学改革的。
    景山学校等校的党组织在教学改革中，坚决依靠拥护教学改革的教师，争取团结那些基本上拥护教学改革但是还有若干疑虑的人，消除他们的疑虑，帮助他们打通思想，提高觉悟；并采取集体备课、观摩教学、进修等办法，帮助他们提高业务水平，克服教学中的困难，使他们解除疑虑，放下思想包袱，心情舒畅地投入到教学改革工作中来。现在，大部分教师决心在党的领导下做到党所指示的：适当缩短年限，适当提高程度，适当控制学时，适当增加劳动。使经验多的教师和经验少的教师结合起来，使有新经验的教师和有老经验的教师结合起来。广大教师在党的领导下充分发挥了共产主义的协作精神，积极进行教学改革。
    从展览会走出来的人，都有一个共同的感觉：这是一个方向明确的展览会。他们正在走一条正确的道路。虽然这个教学改革的试验才刚刚开始不久，尽管具体经验还不够成熟，并且还会不断出现一些新的问题和困难。但是世界上有什么新生事物一诞生就完美无缺呢？重要的是他们敢于革命，这是十分可贵的精神。我们衷心地预祝这个革命的幼苗，在毛泽东思想的雨露下，茁壮成长，开花结果！（附图片）
