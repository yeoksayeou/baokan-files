Strive for a Bumper Harvest of Minor Oilseed Crops
Commentator of This Newspaper

Since this spring, a massive mass movement to plant sesame, sunflowers, and other minor oilseed crops on vacant lots and reclaimed land has been launched across the country. According to incomplete statistics, over 40 billion plants of sesame, sunflowers, etc., have been planted nationwide. What is the concept of over 40 billion minor oilseed plants? It is equivalent to 50 million mu of oil crops. If all of these over 40 billion minor oilseed plants survive and are harvested, with each plant producing one tael of seeds, more than 4 billion jin of oilseeds can be harvested, with a total oil yield of 1.6 billion jin. At the same time, more than 2 billion jin of oil cake can be produced, sufficient to fertilize 20 million mu of farmland. Therefore, strengthening the management of these minor oilseed crops to ensure planting and harvesting is of great significance for increasing oil production.

There is a relatively long period from sowing to harvesting minor oilseed crops, and regular field management is required to ensure a bumper harvest. This is because, on the one hand, minor oilseed crops are generally planted on scattered plots of land, which are easily trampled and damaged; on the other hand, these scattered plots of land are mostly relatively barren, and only by earnestly strengthening management, applying more fertilizer, and watering frequently can we ensure planting and harvesting, and a bumper harvest for every plant.

The management of minor oilseed crops mainly includes seedling care, watering and fertilization, inter-tillage and weeding, and prevention and control of diseases and pests, etc. Localities should manage according to the characteristics of various minor oilseed crops and their growth conditions at different stages. At present, sesame and sunflowers have mostly emerged, and thinning, seedling establishment, and necessary transplanting should be carried out in a timely manner. At the same time, seedling care should be strengthened, drought-stricken areas should be watered in a timely manner, and additional fertilizer should be applied where base fertilizer is insufficient, and trampling by people and livestock should be prevented to ensure vigorous seedling growth.

At present, many regions have paid attention to the field management of minor oilseed crops. Some regions have also established special management agencies. In Jiaohe County, Hebei Province, from the county party committee to the communes and production teams, a secretary is in charge to strengthen leadership in this work, and professional teams have been widely organized to adopt the method of assigning areas and contracting for everything from planting to harvesting and selling. The Taizhou County Party Committee in Jiangsu Province recently conducted a general inspection of seedling checking, seedling replenishment, and seedling establishment for all minor oilseed crops in the county. With the promotion of the inspection team, additional fertilizer has been universally applied once in various places, achieving complete and strong seedlings with good growth. However, there are still a few regions that do not pay enough attention to the management of minor oilseed crops. It is hoped that these regions can quickly pay attention, take effective measures, strengthen the field management of minor oilseed crops, and ensure that every planted seedling is harvested, and every mu planted is harvested. As long as the leadership pays attention and earnestly mobilizes the masses to strengthen field management, this year's minor oilseed crops will surely achieve a bumper harvest.

    要小油料大丰收
    本报评论员
    今春以来，全国各地曾掀起了一个声势浩大的利用空闲地和开荒地大种芝麻、向日葵等小油料的群众运动。据不完全统计，全国共种芝麻、向日葵等四百多亿株。四百多亿株小油料是个什么概念呢？它相当于五千万亩的油料作物。如果这四百多亿株小油料全部成活、全部收获，按每株产籽一两计算，便可收获四十多亿斤油料，总的产油量可达十六亿斤，同时还可以产二十多亿斤油饼，足供肥田二千万亩。因此，加强对这些小油料的管理工作，做到保种保收，对于增加油料产量具有很大意义。
    小油料从播种到收获有一段较长的时间，需要做好经常性的田间管理工作，才能保证丰收。这是因为一方面小油料一般都是利用零星土地种植的，容易遭受践踏伤害；另方面这些零星土地大都比较贫瘠，只有认真加强管理，多施肥、勤浇水，才能保证有种有收，株株丰收。
    小油料的管理工作，主要包括苗期护理、浇水施肥、中耕除草和防治病虫害等等。各地应当根据各种小油料的特性和不同时期的生长情况，进行管理。目前，芝麻、向日葵大部已经出苗，应该及时地进行间苗、定苗和必要的移苗补植。同时，要加强苗期护理工作，干旱地区要及时浇水，底肥不足的要进行追肥，并防止人畜践踏，保证幼苗生长茁壮。
    目前很多地区对小油料的田间管理工作已经引起重视。有些地区还成立了专管机构。河北省交河县从县委到公社、生产队，都由一位书记挂帅，加强对这个工作的领导，并普遍地组织了专业队，采取划片包干的办法，从种到收到交售一包到底。江苏省泰州县委最近对全县小油料普遍进行了一次查苗、补苗、定苗的检查工作，经过检查团的推动，各地已普遍追肥一次，做到了苗全苗壮、生长良好。但也还有少数地区对小油料的管理工作重视不够，希望这些地区能很快地重视起来，采取有效措施，加强小油料的田间管理，保证小油料种一棵，收一棵，种一亩，收一亩。只要领导上重视，并认真发动群众加强田间管理，今年的小油料一定能获得大丰收。
