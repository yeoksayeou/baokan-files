Glimpses of the Wheat Harvest (Two Poems)
    Sun Jun

    The Old Man and the Sickle
    The cuckoo calls,
    The summer harvest has arrived,
    The old man hurriedly picks up his sickle,
    Pauses, then puts it down again.
    The old man looks at the sickle,
    The blade is narrow and small,
    How many whetstones have worn away,
    Harvesting thousands of acres of wheat and rice.
    The old man looks at the sickle,
    Joy fills his smiling face,
    The first year of the commune,
    The sickle sings like a flying knife.
    The old man looks at the sickle,
    His heart leaps with joy,
    The second year of the commune,
    Machines replace the clumsy sickle.
    The old man looks at the sickle,
    Holding it close to his chest,
    His heart remembers the Communist Party,
    Thanks to Chairman's good leadership.

    Tall Wheat Stacks
    The commune's threshing ground is truly bustling,
    New songs float in the sky.
    The young men seem to be on the tenth floor,
    The girls stand as if on the ninth pavilion.
    Not a building, not a pavilion,
    Wheat stacks are high, reaching the blue sky.

    麦收小景（诗两首）
    孙隼
    老汉和镰刀
    布谷鸟儿叫，
    夏收已来到，
    老汉急忙拿起镰，
    一怔，忽又放下了。
    老汉对镰瞧，
    镰头窄又小，
    磨洼多少磨镰石，
    收过千顷麦和稻。
    老汉对镰瞧，
    心喜脸上笑，
    公社成立第一年，
    镰儿沙沙像飞刀。
    老汉对镰瞧，
    喜心蹦蹦跳，
    公社成立第二年，
    机器代替笨镰刀。
    老汉对镰瞧，
    握镰怀中抱，
    心头思念共产党，
    多亏主席好领导。
    麦垛高
    公社麦场真红火，
    半天空里飘新歌。
    小伙子像在十重楼，
    姑娘们如站九重阁。
    不是楼，不是阁，
    头顶蓝天麦垛高。
