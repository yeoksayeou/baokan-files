    In the Mount Everest region, there are magnificent ice and snow landscapes, as well as lush green worlds, vast primeval forests, and colorful wildflowers and grasses. However, like other aspects of science, our understanding of the distribution of plants on this "roof of the world" has been very limited for many years. Not long ago, we organized a larger-scale professional comprehensive scientific expedition to investigate the distribution of plants in the Mount Everest region.

    The botanical team of the scientific expedition consisted of four young people. After several months of investigation, we drew a vegetation map of the survey route at a scale of 1:200,000 (the coverage of plants on the ground), and a simplified forest distribution map of certain river valley areas at a scale of 1:100,000; we collected many specimens, and preliminarily understood and summarized the climate and agricultural conditions of this area.

    Our survey area was the east, west, and north sides of the peak. In the east and west, the climate is relatively mild. Here, almost every slightly flat area in the river valleys has been cultivated by the industrious Tibetan people into farmland, where they grow highland barley, potatoes, rapeseed, radishes, and other crops. The vegetation in this area is very lush, especially the primeval forests, which look green and verdant from a distance, truly resembling a green sea. We conducted a detailed survey of the various types of primeval forests. In the lower-altitude areas near the river mouths within this forest, various dwarf ferns grow, giving off the atmosphere of a subtropical forest. In this primeval forest, the fastest-growing trees with the largest timber reserves and the best quality are the Abies georgei forest, birch forest, and maple trees. Among them, the timber quality of Abies georgei is the best. Its trunk is thick, round, straight, and tall, reaching more than 30 meters. It grows very densely, and local Tibetans often use it as a building material.

    Going up along the river valley, out of the "forest sea," another scene appears before us. There are no more verdant primeval forests here. On the eastern slopes of the peak, red, purple, yellow, pink, and white rhododendrons bloom all over the mountains and fields. Clumps of prostrate dark green Juniperus squamata var. wilsonii are interspersed among them, covering the slopes on both sides of the river valley with brocade of flower clusters. Especially in places with glaciers and glacial lakes, you can see wonderful scenery: in the distance are towering snow-capped mountains reaching into the clouds, and nearby are patches of emerald green lake water. The blooming rhododendrons and mountains are reflected in the lake, and silky thin clouds drift slowly, truly resembling a fairyland from mythology.

    On the north side of the peak, the areas we surveyed were all above 5,000 meters above sea level. High mountains block the warm and humid air currents from the Indian Ocean in the south, and the dry and cold air currents from the north have a significant impact on this area. Therefore, the climate in this area is very dry and cold, and the soil is poor. The plants here have survived by overcoming harsh climatic conditions. This area is known as the alpine desert zone, with long severe winters and little rainfall. In general areas, spring is always a season of blossoming flowers, but the plants here do not flower and bear fruit until July; the growing season for general plants is from May to July. Due to the short growing season, the development stages of many plants are relatively compact, and the development cycle is very short. They just begin to grow in mid-May and bloom by mid-June. Here, the length of the growing season is closely related to altitude. The closer the plants are to the snow line, the later they start growing and the shorter their growing season. Conversely, the lower the altitude at which they grow, the earlier they bloom and the longer their growing season. Plants growing in this alpine desert zone also have many other characteristics adapted to the dry and cold climate, such as: many branches that are densely interwoven into mats; "Oxytropis" and "Astragalus" are typical examples. They form such mats to retain warmth and moisture, and also to resist high winds and strong solar radiation in the plateau. The leaves are very small and densely covered with fluff, the stomata are sunken, and the epidermis has a thick cuticle, etc., all to resist high winds and strong solar radiation, and to reduce water evaporation. Some plants have white fluff on their leaves, which can further reflect solar radiation.

    In areas with even higher altitudes, there are exposed rocks everywhere. Even if you occasionally see small grasses, they only grow sporadically in the cracks of the rocks. But is there no plant life here other than that? No, if you look closely, you can find patches of things clinging tightly to the surface of these rocks. These are lower plants called "lichens." They are the vanguard of plant occupation; they can grow where other plants cannot grow, and they can provide living conditions for other plants.

    The Mount Everest region is a palace of ice and snow, but it is also a rich and colorful botanical garden, waiting for us to further investigate, research, and develop its resources.

### 世界屋脊上有些什么树木花草？

    世界屋脊上有些什么树木花草？
    梁崇鋕
    在珠穆朗玛峰地区，有奇丽的冰雪景象，也有葱郁的绿荫世界，有茫茫的原始森林，也有五颜六色的野花野草。可是，人们对于这个世界屋脊上的植物分布情况，正像其他各方面的科学情况一样，过去许多年来，一直了解得很少。不久以前，我们组织了一个较大规模的专业综合科学考察队，到珠穆朗玛峰地区考察植物分布的情况。
    科学考察队的植物小组是由我们四个年轻人组成的。经过几个月的考察，我们绘制了一幅二十万分之一的考察路线植被图（植物在地面上被复的情况），某些河谷地区的十万分之一森林分布简图；采集了许多标本，并初步了解和总结了这个地区的气候和农业概况。
    我们考察的地区是峰的东、西、北部。在东部和西部，气候比较温和。这里的河谷地区几乎每一块稍微平坦的地方，都已被勤劳的藏族人民开辟为农田，种植着青稞、马铃薯、油菜、萝卜等作物。这一带植物生长十分茂盛，特别是原始森林，远远望去，郁郁苍苍，真似一片绿海。我们对这片原始森林的各个类型作了较详细的调查。这片森林里面的河口附近海拔较低的地区，生长着各种矮小的蕨类植物，具有亚热带森林的气息。在这原始森林中，生长比较迅速、木材蓄积量较大、材质优良的，要算亚东冷杉林、桦木林和槭树，其中又以亚东冷杉的木材质量最佳，它的树干粗大，圆整而修直，高达三十多米，生长得很茂密，当地藏民常利用它作为建筑材料。
    沿着河谷往上，走出“林海”，出现在我们眼前的又是另一番景象了。这里没有郁郁苍苍的原始森林，在峰的东部山坡上，满山遍野地盛开着红色、紫色、黄色、粉红色和白色的杜鹃花，一丛丛匍伏地面的墨绿色的滇藏方枝柏掺杂其间，使河谷两侧山坡披上了花簇的锦缎。尤其是在有冰川冰湖的地方，可以看到绝妙的景色：远处是一座座高入云霄的皓皓雪山，近处是一块块碧绿的湖水，盛开的杜鹃和山峦倒映在湖中，丝绢一般的薄云徐徐飘荡，真似神话中的仙境一般。
    峰北面，我们考察的地区都在拔海五千米以上。高山阻隔着南来的印度洋暖气流，北方的干寒气流对这地区却影响颇大，因此这一地区的气候很干寒，土壤贫薄。这里的植物，是战胜了严酷的气候条件才活下来的。这个地区被称为高原寒漠带，严冬漫长，雨量稀少。在一般地区，春天总是百花盛开的季节，而这里的植物要到7月才开花结实；一般植物的生长期是5月至7月。由于生长期短促，许多植物的发育阶段比较紧凑，发育周期很短，在5月中旬刚开始生长，到6月中旬便开花了。在这里，植物生长期的长短同海拔高度密切相关，向上越是接近雪线的植物，生长开始越晚，生长期越短。相反地，生长在拔海越低的地区，开花越早，生长期越长，生长在这高原寒漠地带的植物，还有着其他许多适应干寒气候的特点，例如：分枝繁多，且密集交织成垫状，“棘豆”、“紫云英”等便是典型的例子。它们形成这样的垫状是为了保温保湿，同时也为了抵抗高原大风和强烈的太阳辐射等生活条件，叶子很小，并且密生茸毛，气孔下陷，表皮外具有较厚的角质层，等等，也都是为了抗御大风和强烈的太阳辐射，并且可以减少水分蒸发，有些植物叶子有白色茸毛，更可以反射太阳辐射。
    在拔海再高一些的地区，到处都是裸露的岩石，即使偶见小草，也只是零星地生长在石缝中。但除此以外，这里是不是就没有植物生存了呢？不，只要仔细一看，就可以发现有一片片斑状的东西紧紧贴附在这些岩石表面，这是一种名叫
  “地衣”的低等植物，它们是植物占领阵地的先锋，别的植物不能生长的地方，它却能生长，并能为别的植物提供生活条件。
    珠穆朗玛地区是一个冰雪的宫殿，但同时也是一个丰富多彩的植物园，正待我们去进一步调查研究和开发利用。
