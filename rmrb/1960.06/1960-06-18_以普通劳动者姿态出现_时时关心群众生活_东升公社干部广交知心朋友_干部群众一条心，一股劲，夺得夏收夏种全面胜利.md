    (Reported by this newspaper) The broad masses of members of the Dongfeng People's Commune in Shishou County, Hubei Province, sing praises of the cadres in this way: "We eat in the canteen, hold meetings in the fields, carry hoes and shovels with us, and they come whenever there is a difficulty." The 1,410 cadres above the level of small team leader in this commune have each made an average of four close friends from among the poor peasants, forming a situation in which all Party members and the masses, cadres and commune members, are of one heart and one mind, and with one mighty effort, on the basis of achieving a great bumper harvest in the great disaster of 1959, they have successively overcome the attacks of six cold waves and three storms this year, further arranged the lives of the commune members well, and won a comprehensive victory in the summer harvest and summer planting.
    The trend of Dongfeng Commune making close friends was formed through studying Chairman Mao's instructions on "caring for the lives of the masses and paying attention to working methods" and continuous rectification during the period from last winter to this spring. Cadres at all levels, in accordance with the commune Party committee's call to "grasp things deeply and specifically, cadres and the masses are one family, talk heart-to-heart and make friends, and don't say half a lie," carried forward the work style of visiting the poor and asking about their hardships, striking roots and connecting them during the land reform period, and consulting with the masses in case of trouble, making themselves one with the working people in terms of thought, life, and work style through conducting experiments and setting up prototypes together with the masses. Comrade Zou Guangjian, deputy secretary of the commune Party committee, alone made more than seventy close friends in the Zhuangcheng management district. Wherever he went, someone would speak their mind to him. Under his leadership, eighteen cadres in the management district made a total of one hundred and forty-eight close friends. At present, making close friends has developed from cadres making close friends to close friends making close friends. Pi Debao, the leader of the fourth team of the Xieli production team in the Jiaoshan management district, has made seven close friends, forming a strong core led by poor peasants in this team.
    Cadres making close friends with the masses has further promoted a great change in the work style of the cadres and closer relations between the cadres and the masses. On March 6th this year, when the commune suffered from a tornado disaster, Comrade Wan Haitang, the secretary of the Jiaoshan management district's general branch, selflessly rescued many commune members and took off his clothes and gave them to the mother of poor peasant commune member Liu Jiaqing, who had just been rescued. Mother Liu said at the time with emotion: "Parents are dear, but the Communist Party is even dearer. Sons and daughters are good, but the Party's cadres are even better." Cadres love the commune members, and the commune members also love the cadres. When Comrade Guo Fating, deputy secretary of the commune Party committee, was working in the Jiaoshan management district, he fell ill, and the commune members took care of him as if he were their own relative.
    As a result of cadres making close friends with the masses, there is a complete connection between the upper and lower levels of the entire commune, like countless blood vessels connected to each other. According to incomplete statistics from the entire commune, since 1959, close friends have reflected more than 39,000 opinions. Because cadres listen to the words of close friends, they have further implemented the Party's instructions to grasp production with one hand and life with the other, and have comprehensively arranged the lives of the masses well. Yu Benxian, a close friend of Comrade Xia Yunchang, the secretary of the Zhuangcheng management district's general branch, reflected to him that vegetable production had not been grasped well. Xia Yunchang studied the situation with the cadres in the team, fixed six cadres to specialize in growing vegetables, and mobilized the commune members to universally apply fertilizer to the existing vegetables, ensuring the normal growth of vegetables. At present, this commune is vigorously grasping the welfare undertakings centered on the canteens. Of the 226 canteens in the entire commune, 176 have reached the "five-good" standard. Three hundred and twenty specialized vegetable teams have been established, and the area planted with vegetables has reached an average of 1.7 fen of land per person. Twenty-five production teams have basically achieved the goal of paying wages every month, and resolutely do not add night shifts, and rest one to two days per month. Because the Mingguang production team combines work and rest well, the commune members are even more enthusiastic, and labor efficiency has generally improved.
    Cadres and the masses making close friends has further stimulated the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members. This spring, when the early and mid-season rice seedlings were attacked by cold waves, many poor peasant activists automatically stayed in the fields to guard them, and actively put forward methods for protecting the seedlings, such as "bathing, taking medicine, and adding meals." When some seedlings were damaged, they quickly rushed to sow 200,000 jin of grain seeds, thus ensuring that the 51,000 mu of early and mid-season rice were transplanted half a season earlier than in previous years, and the area was also expanded by 10% compared with last year. The early and mid-season rice are generally growing well, and a bumper harvest is in sight. 50% of the early rice has begun to ear, and a large area of mid-season rice is also tillering in large quantities. More than half of the production teams have completed the transplanting of one season of late japonica rice, and are marching towards the barren lakes, planning to expand the cultivated area by another 6,000 mu and transplant deep-water rice to the bottom of the lake. The people of the entire commune are full of confidence and are determined to achieve a greater leap forward in agriculture this year.

    以普通劳动者姿态出现  时时关心群众生活
    东升公社干部广交知心朋友
    干部群众一条心，一股劲，夺得夏收夏种全面胜利
    本报讯　“饭在食堂吃，会在田里开，铣子挖锄随身带，一有困难他就来”。这是湖北石首县东升人民公社的广大社员对干部们的一首赞歌。这个社的一千四百一十个小队长以上干部，平均每一个干部交上了四个贫农知心朋友，形成全公社党员和群众、干部和社员一条心，一股劲，在取得1959年大灾大丰收的基础上，接连战胜了今年六次寒潮和三次暴风的袭击，进一步安排好了社员的生活，夺得了夏收夏种的全面胜利。
    东升公社交知心朋友之风是通过学习毛主席“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”的指示和去冬今春不断整风后形成的。各级干部根据公社党委提出的“深入具体抓，干群是一家，谈心交朋友，不说半点假”的号召，发扬土改时期访贫问苦，扎根串连，遇事和群众商量的作风，通过和群众一起搞试验，办样版，使自己从思想上、生活上、作风上和劳动人民打成了一片。公社党委副书记邹光鉴同志一个人就在庄城管理区交了七十多个知心朋友，他走到那里，那里便有人向他说知心话。在他的带动下，管理区十八个干部，共交了一百四十八个知心朋友。目前还从干部交知心朋友发展到知心朋友交知心朋友，焦山管理区协力生产队四小队队长皮德保的知心朋友张友良就交了七个知心朋友，使这个队形成了以贫农为领导的坚强核心。
    干部和群众交知心朋友，进一步促进了干部作风的大转变，密切了干部和群众的关系。今年3月6日，这个公社遭受龙卷风灾的时候，焦山管理区总支书记万海唐同志奋不顾身地抢救了许多社员，并把自己身上的衣服脱给了刚抢救出来的贫农社员刘家清的母亲。刘大婆当时感动的说：“爹亲娘亲，没有共产党亲，儿好女好，没有党的干部好”。干部爱社员，社员也爱干部。公社党委副书记郭发廷同志在焦山管理区工作时生了病，社员们照顾他像对待自己的亲人一样。
    干部和群众交知心朋友的结果，全公社上下之间，像无数根血管一脉相通。据全社不完全统计，从1959年以来，仅知心朋友反映的意见就达三万九千多条。由于干部听知心朋友的话，进一步贯彻了党的一手抓生产，一手抓生活的指示，全面安排好了群众生活。庄城管理区总支书记夏运昌同志的知心朋友喻本先，向他反映了蔬菜生产没抓好的情况。夏运昌同队里干部研究，固定了六个干部专种蔬菜，并发动社员对现有蔬菜普遍施了一道肥，保证了蔬菜的正常生长。目前这个公社大抓以食堂为中心的生活福利事业。全社二百二十六个食堂，有一百七十六个达到了“五好”。建立了三百二十个专业蔬菜队，种的蔬菜面积达到平均每人一点七分田。有二十五个生产队基本做到了月月发工资，并且坚决不加夜班，每月休息一天到两天。民光生产队由于劳逸结合好，社员干劲更大，劳动工效普遍提高。
    干部和群众交知心朋友，进一步激发了广大社员的劳动热情。今年春天，当早、中稻秧苗受到寒潮袭击时，许多贫农积极分子自动守在田间看护，并且积极地提出了“洗澡、吃药、加餐”的保苗办法。当部分秧苗受损时，他们又很快地赶播了二十万斤谷种，因而保证了五万一千亩早中稻面积比往年提早半个季节插完了秧，面积还比去年扩大了10％。早中稻普遍生长良好，丰收在望，已有50％的早稻开始孕穗，大面积中稻也正在大量分蘖。在半数以上的生产队里已经插完一季晚粳，并且正在向荒湖进军，计划再扩大耕地面积六千亩，把深水稻插到湖底。全社人民满怀着信心，决心实现今年农业更大跃进。
