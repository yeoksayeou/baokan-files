    Yunnan Province, through the collaboration of industry, agriculture, and commerce, has produced ahead of schedule a large number of tools for mid-season cultivation, summer weeding, and autumn harvesting to support the mid-season cultivation and summer weeding campaign. To date, the province has produced more than 8.85 million small farm tools such as weeding rakes and hoes, more than 88,000 pieces of various transportation equipment, nearly 13,000 units of processing and irrigation machinery, as well as a large number of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and rain gear.
    The spring plowing and planting work in Yunnan Province was generally started earlier and progressed faster and with better quality than in previous years. At present, the planting work has largely entered the final stage and mid-season cultivation and summer weeding have begun half a month to a month earlier than in previous years. Party committees at all levels have organized the production of mid-season cultivation and summer weeding tools in advance. Various localities have adopted the method of industry-commerce collaboration to go deep into the countryside and jointly study and formulate plans with farmers to organize production. Furthermore, based on the characteristics of this year's large planting area and the concentrated need for various agricultural tools, they have arranged the production and supply time according to the priority and urgency. Many areas have also established registration cards to record the tools that each commune, management area, and production team needs to repair and add, according to specifications, time, and quantity, to ensure that the supply work is ahead of the season.
    The broad masses of workers and staff on the industrial and commercial fronts in various localities have played an active, proactive, and creative role in supporting the agricultural movement, ensuring that whatever agriculture needs is produced, and arranging the production of urgently needed items as early as possible.
    This newspaper also reports that Jiangxi is launching a large-scale bumper harvest campaign for economic crops, vigorously grasping the field management of economic crops with the same energy as grasping early rice, striving to keep pace with early rice and achieve an all-round leap forward.
    This year, Jiangxi Province has implemented the policy of taking grain as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward. The planting area of economic crops such as cotton, hemp, sugarcane, and tobacco has reached more than 2.4 million mu, an increase of nearly 400,000 mu over last year. After these crops were planted, due to the abnormal climate in the previous period, some economic crops, especially cotton, began to experience the phenomenon of seedling blight and missing seedlings, and some seedlings did not grow strong enough. To this end, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently instructed all localities to grasp the field management of economic crops with the same energy as grasping early rice while grasping the current field management of early rice, and to launch a large-scale bumper harvest campaign for economic crops throughout the province, focusing on vigorous efforts to check seedlings and replant, weed and topdress, and prevent and control plant diseases and insect pests, striving to ensure that all seedlings are complete and strong.
    At present, the large-scale bumper harvest campaign for economic crops has been launched throughout the province. The Gannan Administrative Region is grasping both early rice and economic crops, and is launching a "hundred, thousand, ten thousand" bumper harvest campaign to strive for over 100 jin of ginned cotton, over 1,000 jin of jute, and over 10,000 jin of sugarcane. The first secretaries of the district party committees, county party committees, and commune party committees at all three levels are personally in charge, going deep into the economic crop areas, and leading the broad masses of commune members to vigorously carry out field management of cotton, hemp, and sugarcane. Under the leadership of the county party secretary, the county party committee members and responsible cadres of agricultural departments in Nankang County are assigned to contract areas, with division of labor and responsibility. The county has organized more than 24,000 people to check seedlings and replant on the one hand, and to carry out a shock weeding, soil cultivation, and topdressing campaign on the other. More than 1,800 mu of cotton have been weeded and topdressed once or twice; more than 52,000 mu of sugarcane have been weeded and topdressed two to three times; and more than 4,700 mu of jute have also been weeded and topdressed for the first time, and all have achieved complete seedlings.

    云南赶制出大量夏锄和秋收工具
    江西农民积极给棉麻蔗烟等经济作物除草追肥
    本报讯　云南省工农商协作提前生产出大批中耕夏锄和秋收工具，支援中耕夏锄运动。到目前为止，全省已生产薅秧耙、锄头等小农具八百八十五万多把，各种运输工具八万八千多件，加工机械和排灌机械近一万三千台，以及大批化肥、农药和防雨用具。
    云南省春耕栽插工作普遍比往年抓得早，并且进度快，质量好。目前栽种工作大都已经进入扫尾阶段，并比往年提前半个月到一个月开始了中耕夏锄。各级党委都提前组织了中耕夏锄工具的生产。各地都采取工商协作深入农村，和农民一道共同研究制订计划的办法组织生产，并且根据今年播种面积大，各种农具需要量多而集中的特点，按轻重缓急安排生产供应时间。不少地区还建立了登记卡片，将各公社、管理区、生产队需要修补和新增加的工具，按规格、时间、数量登记，保证供应工作走在季节前面。
    各地工业、商业战线上的广大职工，在支援农业运动中发挥了积极、主动和创造精神，保证农业需要什么就生产什么，把急需要的尽量安排提前生产。
    本报讯　江西各地开展经济作物大面积丰产运动，以抓早稻的劲头大抓经济作物田间管理，力争与早稻并驾齐驱，实现全面跃进。
    今年江西省贯彻以粮为纲全面跃进的方针，棉、麻、蔗、烟等经济作物播种面积达到二百四十多万亩，比去年扩大近四十万亩。这些作物播种以后，由于前一时期气候不够正常，有些经济作物、特别是棉花开始出现了枯苗缺苗现象，有些幼苗生长不够茁壮。为此，中共江西省委最近指示各地在抓好当前早稻田间管理的同时，要以抓早稻的劲头，狠狠抓好经济作物的田间管理工作，在全省范围内掀起一个以大搞查苗补苗、除草追肥、防治病虫害为中心的经济作物大面积丰产运动，力争丘丘苗全、苗壮。
    目前经济作物大面积丰产运动已在全省展开。赣南行政区一手抓早稻、一手抓经济作物，展开争取皮棉超百斤、黄麻超千斤、甘蔗超万斤的“百、千、万”丰产运动。全区区党委、县委、公社党委三级书记亲自挂帅，深入经济作物地区，领导广大社员大搞棉、麻、甘蔗的田间管理工作。南康县在县委书记率领下，县委委员和农业部门负责干部分片包干，分工负责，全县组织了二万四千多人对经济作物一面查苗补苗，一面突击锄草、培土、追肥，已为一千八百多亩棉花普遍锄草、追肥一到二次；五万二千多亩甘蔗锄草、追肥二到三次；四千七百多亩黄麻也进行了第一次锄草、追肥，并且全部达到了苗齐苗足。
