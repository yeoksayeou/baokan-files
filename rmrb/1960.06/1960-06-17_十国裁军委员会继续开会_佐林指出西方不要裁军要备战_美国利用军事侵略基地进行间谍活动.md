Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 14th: The Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee held a meeting on the 14th, chaired by the representative of the Romanian People's Republic, Mishingescu. The head of the Soviet delegation, Zorin, made a lengthy speech at the meeting, accusing Western countries of not wanting disarmament but continuing to expand their armies and prepare for war.

Zorin exposed the position taken by the US representative, Eaton, on the first phase of measures in the Soviet plan for complete and thorough disarmament. The US representative had said that implementing the measures stipulated in the first phase of the Soviet plan would deprive the West of the "basic possibility of defending against aggression." Zorin pointed out that Eaton's speech was related to the new measures of the arms race recently adopted by the US government.

Zorin said, we know that certain groups in the United States pay special attention to those military bases close to the socialist borders, and we know what role these bases play in the American strategic plans. And how these bases are used in peacetime—this is something the whole world now knows. Bases for military aggression, and bases for espionage and intrusion into the airspace of peaceful countries in peacetime—this is the role of the military bases set up by the United States on the territory of other countries.

Zorin made a preliminary summary of the work of the committee in the past period. He said,

　　First, the committee has not yet substantially studied the main issues of the Soviet disarmament plan. It can be seen that Western countries are clearly evading this issue.

　　Second, the US representative has shown a negative attitude towards certain basic arguments of the Soviet proposal. It seems that the policy of the United States is to oppose complete and thorough disarmament, continue the arms race, and exacerbate tensions in international relations. The facts of the recent period give sufficient reason to draw this conclusion.

　　Third, the attitude of the Western delegations towards the Soviet proposals proves that the West is unwilling to move forward on the road to genuine and serious negotiations for the conclusion of a treaty on complete and thorough disarmament.

    十国裁军委员会继续开会
    佐林指出西方不要裁军要备战
    美国利用军事侵略基地进行间谍活动
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦14日讯：十国裁军委员会14日在罗马尼亚人民共和国代表米辛契斯库的主持下举行会议。苏联代表团团长佐林在会上作了长篇发言，指责西方国家不要裁军，而是要继续扩军备战。
    佐林揭露了美国代表伊顿就苏联全面彻底裁军计划第一阶段措施所采取的立场。美国代表曾经说，实现苏联计划第一阶段所规定的措施会剥夺西方“防御侵略的基本可能性”。佐林指出，伊顿的发言同美国政府最近采取的军备竞赛的新措施有联系。
    佐林说，我们知道，美国某些集团特别注重于那些靠近社会主义边界的军事基地，我们知道，这些基地在美国战略计划中起怎样的作用。而这些基地在和平条件下是怎样被利用的——这是全世界现在都知道的事情。进行军事侵略的基地，而在和平时期是进行间谍活动和侵入和平国家领空的基地——这就是美国在别国领土上设置的军事基地的作用。
    佐林对委员会过去一个时期的工作初步作了一些总结。他说，
    第一，委员会对苏联裁军计划的主要问题实质上还没有进行研究。可以看出，西方国家显然在回避这个问题。
    第二，美国代表对苏联建议的某些基本论点表现出否定的态度。看来，美国的政策在于反对全面彻底裁军，继续进行军备竞赛，加剧国际关系中的紧张局势。最近一个时期的事实使得有充分的根据得出这种看法。
    第三，西方代表团对待苏联建议的态度证明，西方不愿意在为缔结全面彻底裁军条约而进行真正认真的谈判的道路上向前迈进。
