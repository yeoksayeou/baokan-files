Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, June 26th: Tianjin held a radio rally of people from all walks of life on the 25th to oppose American aggression against Korea and support the Korean people's peaceful reunification of their motherland.

Guo Fang, Vice Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, spoke at the meeting. He said that the victory of the great War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea exposed the true nature of the US imperialist paper tiger and inspired the world's people to fight against US imperialism. He stated that the Chinese people are determined to be the strong backing of the Korean people, resolutely oppose US imperialist aggression against Korea, and resolutely support the Korean people's just struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland. Xu Guang, a representative of Tianjin's people's organizations, Hu Yi, a representative of various democratic parties, and Zhang Xiaocai, the former battalion commander of the Wuyin Mountain Meritorious Battalion of the Volunteer Army, also spoke at the meeting.

On the night of the 25th, nearly 100,000 professional and amateur artists in the city took to the streets in the rain to carry out large-scale propaganda activities against US imperialism. A chorus of 600 young students sang loudly in the square. The famous "No. 6 Gate" art troupe organized by dockworkers and the amateur choir of Tianjin No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory also came to participate in the performance despite the rain. Binjiang Road in the city center was filled with cartoons, propaganda paintings and pictures exposing US imperialism. More than 30,000 professional and amateur artists performed skits, song and dance dramas, and folk art programs here.

He said that the 54 million people of Shandong, like the people of the whole country, will always stand closely with the heroic Korean people and be ready at any time to smash any aggression and war provocations by US imperialism together with the Korean people. Xia Zhengong said that US imperialism is playing the two-faced trick of "false peace, real war preparations, false relaxation, real aggression," attempting to deceive and paralyze the world's people. However, the awakened people of the world, especially the people of Asia, clearly know that US imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of world peace, and the aggressive nature of imperialism will never change. As long as imperialism exists, world peace will be seriously threatened. Xia Zhengong concluded by saying that China and Korea are as closely related as lips and teeth, and have forged an unbreakable friendship in blood in the past in the common struggle against US imperialism; the Chinese people will always stand with the Korean people and severely strike at US imperialist aggression.

Also speaking at the meeting were the heads of various democratic parties and people's organizations.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, June 26th: More than 5,000 people from all walks of life in Shanxi Province and Taiyuan City held a rally yesterday to oppose American aggression against Korea and support the Korean people's just struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland.

He represented the 16 million people of Shanxi Province in expressing firm support for the Korean people's unyielding and just struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland. He said: We believe that the heroic Korean people, with the support of the people of socialist countries and the people of all countries in the world, will eventually win the final victory. The American aggressors will be driven out of South Korea sooner or later. He also said that the tens of millions of compatriots in the Taiwan region of our country, like the people of South Korea, are still living in a living hell and suffering extremely deeply. We must liberate Taiwan.

Also speaking at today's meeting were the heads of democratic parties and people's organizations.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, June 26th: More than 2,100 people from all walks of life in Jiangxi Province and Nanchang City held a rally in Nanchang on the evening of the 25th to oppose American aggression against Korea and support the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland.

Bai Dongcai, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Guo Guangzhou, Alternate Secretary, attended the meeting. Mo Xun, Vice Chairman of the Jiangxi Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, spoke at the meeting.

Mo Xun said that US imperialist aggression against Korea eloquently shows that imperialism is the root cause of modern war. In order to defend world peace, we must resolutely oppose the war policy and aggressive policy of imperialism, especially US imperialism, and thoroughly expose all the conspiracies and peaceful disguises of US imperialism to undermine world peace and create international tensions. He said that the great victory of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea also fully proved that US imperialism is a paper tiger that looks strong but is weak inside.

Mo Xun exposed the crimes of US imperialism in obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea, occupying our country's territory of Taiwan, and frantically carrying out arms expansion and war preparations. He pointed out that facts prove that US imperialism is the pillar of all the most reactionary and decadent forces in the world and the common enemy of the people of the world.

Mo Xun said that we will never forget that our country's territory of Taiwan is still under the occupation and trampling of American robbers. We must drive the American robbers out of Taiwan.

Mo Xun then talked about the unbreakable fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean people. He pointed out that the Chinese people firmly support the Korean people's sacred struggle against American aggression and for the peaceful reunification of their motherland, and firmly believe that the Korean people's great struggle will surely be victorious.
