Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 8th: The Japanese Socialist Party today issued a statement strongly condemning U.S. Secretary of State Herter's remarks on the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the 7th.

The statement pointed out that Herter's testimony clearly stipulated that the meaning of the term "Far East" includes China and the Soviet Union, which is obviously contradictory to the Japanese government's interpretation of this region. The Socialist Party's statement attached great importance to the vague definition given by Herter to the "prior consultation" provision. According to his interpretation, "prior consultation" is optional for the United States when deploying troops from Japan. The statement said that this also contradicts the Japanese government's interpretation of the "prior consultation" provision.

The statement also criticized the Senate for holding a closed-door meeting when discussing "prior consultation," and condemned this as "an attempt to conceal the truth and prevent the Japanese people from knowing."

The statement attacked Herter's remarks during his testimony that Japan must aid the United States when the United States is in a hostile state with the Soviet Union. The statement said that Herter's statement confirms the Socialist Party's view that the revised "Security Treaty" is a military alliance that takes the Soviet Union as Japan's potential enemy.

The Socialist Party statement pointed out, referring to Herter's claim that the United States needs Japanese bases so that the United States can fulfill its obligations under the treaties with the Philippines, Chiang Kai-shek, and South Korea, that the U.S. Secretary of State's statement shows that the United States is attempting to organize a Northeast Asia Treaty Organization through the revised Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty". The statement pointed out, "It is no accident that Eisenhower wants to go to all the places mentioned in Herter's speech."

    日本社会党发表声明谴责赫脱讲话
    指出日美条约是以苏联为敌的军事侵略同盟
    新华社8日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天发表声明，强烈谴责美国国务卿赫脱7日在参议院外交委员会上关于新日美“安全条约”的发言。
    声明指出，赫脱的证词明确地规定，“远东”一词的含义包括中国和苏联在内，这同日本政府关于这个地区的解释是显然有矛盾的。社会党的声明很重视赫脱对“事先协商”的规定所下的含糊的定义，按照他的解释，在美国从日本派出部队时，对美国来说，“事先协商”是可有可无的。声明说，这也是同日本政府对“事先协商”这一规定的解释相抵触的。
    声明还指责说，当讨论到“事先协商”时，参议院就举行秘密会议，声明谴责说，“这是企图隐瞒真象，不让日本人民知道。”
    声明抨击赫脱作证时所说的如下的话：当美国同苏联处于敌对状态时，日本必须援助美国。声明说，赫脱这种说法，证实了社会党的看法，即修改后的“安全条约”是以苏联为日本潜在敌人的军事同盟。
    社会党声明在提到赫脱所谓美国需要日本的基地以便美国履行美菲、美蒋和美国同南朝鲜的条约规定的义务这种说法时指出，美国国务卿这种说法表明美国企图通过修改后的日美“安全条约”来组织东北亚条约组织。声明指出，“艾森豪威尔要到赫脱发言中所提到的所有这些地方去，这不是偶然的”。
