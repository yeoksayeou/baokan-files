    Presented to Elder Ōtani Kōjun
    Zhao Puchu
    Elder Ōtani Kōjun leads Japanese Buddhists in a righteous struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance, and recently announced his withdrawal from the Liberal Democratic Party. His righteous voice is widely admired. Gazing afar at Japan, I joyfully present this verse. I hope for your approval.
    The hearts of tigers and wolves know no end,
    The actions of the伥gui know no shame.
    Breaking through the miasma with a thunderous sound,
    Raising a spine like a true Buddhist!
    Supporting righteousness and being strong and heroic,
    What difficulty is there in subduing the poisonous dragon with collective strength?
    Do not say the black wind blows dangerous waves,
    Already we see the morning sun shining red in the sky.

    寄赠大谷莹润长老
    赵朴初
    大谷莹润长老领导日本佛教徒为反对日美军事同盟进行正义斗争，近复宣布退出自由民主党。义声所播，遐迩同钦。遥望扶桑，喜拈此偈。即希印可。虎狼之心不知止，伥鬼之行不知耻。冲开瘴雾震雷音，竖起脊梁真佛子！扶持正气健为雄，群力何难制毒龙？莫道黑风吹浪险，已看朝旭照天红。
