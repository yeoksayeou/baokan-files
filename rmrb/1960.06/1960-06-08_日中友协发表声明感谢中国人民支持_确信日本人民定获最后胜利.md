    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 7th: The Japan-China Friendship Association issued a statement thanking the Chinese people for their support in the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

    The statement, issued on June 3rd, emphasized that the Japanese people, with the working class at the center, launched the 17th nationwide unified action to crush the new "Security Treaty," which dealt a heavy blow to the U.S.-Japan reactionaries. U.S. imperialism and the Nobusuke Kishi clique, which betrays national interests, have been completely isolated and are increasingly trapped in a difficult situation.

    The statement said that the large-scale demonstrations launched by the Chinese people across the country to support the Japanese people's opposition to the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty have given our struggle enthusiastic support and encouragement, further strengthening the Japanese people's confidence in victory.

    The statement pointed out that the current struggle waged by the Japanese people is a struggle against the common enemy of the people of Asian countries and its running dogs.

    In its statement, the Japan-China Friendship Association stated that it will do its utmost to wage unremitting struggle to completely crush the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and to establish a government that normalizes relations between Japan and China. The statement is confident that final victory will surely belong to the Japanese people. (Attached picture)
