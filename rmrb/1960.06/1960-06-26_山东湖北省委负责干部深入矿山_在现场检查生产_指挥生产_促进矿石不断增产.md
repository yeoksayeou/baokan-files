Shandong, Hubei Provincial Party Committee Responsible Cadres Deep Dive into Mines
On-site inspection of production, directing production, promoting continuous increase in ore production

Jinan, June 25th (From Our Newspaper) Leading cadres at all levels in Shandong Province are going deep into iron mines, participating in production, inspecting production, and directing production, which has promoted the continuous improvement of ore production throughout the province. The average daily output from June 1st to 20th increased by 8.3% compared to the same period last month, and the average ore reserves of steel units throughout the province are now more than eight days.

Deng Chenxi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee, and responsible persons from the province's relevant industrial leadership departments, have successively gone to iron mines in Yantai, Zibo, Jinan, and other places to inspect and guide mine production and technological transformation, which greatly encouraged the broad masses of workers. Leading cadres of the Provincial Industrial Production Committee and the Provincial Metallurgical Department recently helped Jinling Iron Mine in Zibo summarize advanced experiences, and quickly promoted them through the province's on-site meeting on the "Four Transformations" of mines. This has enabled the province's ore production to make leaps again and again. The Linyi area established a "Mining Headquarters" composed of leading cadres such as the Commissioner, the Director of the Industrial Department of the Prefectural Party Committee, the Secretary of the Linyi Municipal Party Committee, the Director of the Municipal Metallurgical Bureau, and the Party Secretaries of major mines. They went to various mines to eat, live, and work with the workers, vigorously grasped effective measures, and attacked key production areas, so that the average daily output of ore in the district increased sharply from more than 2,790 tons in early June to more than 3,800 tons in mid-June.

Jinling Iron Mine, one of the province's key mines, the Secretary of the Mine Party Committee, the Mine Director, and others went deep into the production site, taking turns on duty day and night. Aiming at the weak link of stripping, on the one hand, they educated the masses to adhere to both mining and stripping, and on the other hand, they conscientiously organized the masses to vigorously promote advanced technologies such as hopper stripping and trench stripping, thereby increasing stripping efficiency by more than 50%, increasing the amount of ore recovered, and reducing the labor intensity of workers. Ore production in the first and middle ten days of June increased sharply by 24.3% compared with the same period in May, and more than half of the annual production plan has been completed.

Wuhan, June 25th (From Our Newspaper) Leading cadres at all levels of the Daye Iron Mine of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation are going deep into the front line of production at all levels, working with the masses to focus on key and weak links in production, and promoting a substantial increase in ore production. In May, the main indicators such as iron concentrate, lump ore, and powder ore increased by 28.5% to 37% respectively compared with April. In the first and middle ten days of June, there was a large increase compared with the same period in May. As of June 17, finished ore had completed more than half of the annual plan thirteen days ahead of schedule.

Since the battle to seize ore and protect steel began in early May, Wang Shucheng, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee, Han Kehua, Minister of Industry, Tang Ruipu, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Huangshi Municipal Party Committee, and Lu Shengliang, Deputy Manager of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, and other leading comrades, have successively gone to the mine to study key issues in production with the mine leaders, vigorously grasp ore production, encourage the masses to work hard, and ensure that the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's blast furnaces are well-fed and well-nourished. With the specific assistance of responsible comrades from the provincial, municipal party committees, and Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, leaders at all levels of the mine have gone deep into the front line of production, implemented division of labor and contracting, sat in key positions, and mobilized the masses to focus on key production areas. Chen Mingjiang, Secretary of the Mine Party Committee, and Liu Qing, Deputy Mine Director, led Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League cadres to go deep into the mining workshop to specifically help the workshop organize production. For example, the Jianshan Work Area is the main mining area of ​​this workshop, but because the layout of the mining area is unreasonable and the equipment efficiency cannot be fully utilized, it affects the rapid increase of ore output. The Party Committee Secretary went deep into the work area and jointly studied with the work area party branch, put forward a plan to open two trenches and three lines, and launched a high-efficiency competition among the masses for thousand-meter-ton drilling rigs, ten-thousand-ton electric furnaces, and ten-thousand-ton locomotives. This expanded the working face, increased the spoil ground, and shortened the transportation distance, which greatly improved the efficiency of the equipment, and the daily output level of the entire work area rapidly increased from 8,000 tons to more than 16,000 tons.

Driven by this work area, the entire mine, from mining to ore dressing, from the foot of the mountain to the top of the mountain, launched a high-efficiency competition in full swing, promoting the steady increase of ore production.

    山东湖北省委负责干部深入矿山
    在现场检查生产　指挥生产　促进矿石不断增产
    本报济南25日电　山东各级领导干部深入铁矿山，参加生产，检查生产，指挥生产，促进了全省矿石生产不断提高，6月1日至20日的平均日产量比上月同期增长8．3％，并使全省钢铁单位平均已有八天多的矿石储量。
    中共山东省委书记处书记邓辰西，以及省有关工业领导部门的负责人，都先后到烟台、淄博、济南等地铁矿山检查、指导矿上的生产和技术改造，使广大职工受到很大鼓舞，省工业生产委员会和省冶金厅的领导干部，最近帮助淄博金岭铁矿总结先进经验，并通过全省矿山四化现场会议，迅速予以推广，从而使全省矿石生产一跃再跃。临沂地区成立了由专员、地委工业部长、临沂市委书记、市冶金局长以及主要矿山的党委书记等领导干部组成的“采矿指挥部”，分头深入各矿，通过和职工同吃、同住、同劳动，猛抓有效措施，力攻生产关键，使全区矿石平均日产量由6月上旬的二千七百九十余吨猛增到中旬的三千八百余吨。
    全省重点矿山之一的金岭铁矿，矿党委书记、矿长等深入生产现场，昼夜轮流值班，针对剥离这一薄弱环节，一方面教育群众坚持采剥并举，另一方面，认真组织群众大力推行漏斗剥岩、斩槽剥岩等先进技术，从而使剥离工效提高50％以上，增加了回采矿量，减轻了工人劳动强度，6月上、中两旬的矿石生产，比5月同期猛增24．3％，并已完成全年生产计划的一半以上。
    本报武汉25日电　武钢大冶铁矿各级领导干部层层深入生产第一线，同群众一道狠抓生产上的关键和薄弱环节，促进了矿石生产大幅度的增长。5月份铁精矿、块矿、粉矿等主要指标，比4月份分别增长28．5％到37％。6月上中两旬又比5月同期有了很大增长，截至6月17日止，成品矿提前十三天完成了全年计划的一半以上。
    5月初，这个矿的夺矿保钢战斗开展起来以后，中共湖北省委书记处书记王树成、工业部长韩克华、中共黄石市委书记处书记汤瑞普和武汉钢铁公司副经理卢盛量等领导同志，先后深入到这个矿山，和矿领导一起研究生产中的关键问题，狠抓矿石生产，鼓励群众大干特干，确保武钢高炉吃饱、吃好。在省、市委和武钢总公司负责同志具体帮助下，该矿各级领导纷纷深入生产第一线，实行分工包干，坐镇重点，发动群众狠抓生产关键。矿党委书记陈明江、副矿长刘清带领党政工团干部深入采矿车间，具体帮助这个车间组织生产。例如尖山工区是这个车间的主要采矿区，但是由于采场布置不合理，设备效率不能充分发挥，影响矿石产量的迅速提高。党委书记深入这个工区和工区党支部共同研究，提出了开辟两沟三线的方案，发动群众掀起了一个千米吨钻机、万吨电炉、万吨机车的高工效竞赛热潮。因而扩大了掌子面，增加了排土场，缩短了运距，使设备效率大大发挥，全工区日产水平由八千吨迅速提高到一万六千吨以上。
    在这个工区的带动下，全矿从采矿到选矿、从山下到山上都热火朝天地开展了高工效的大竞赛，促进了矿石产量节节上升。
