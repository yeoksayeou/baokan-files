    A Short History of Shipbuilding
    Fei Bai
    In the great leap forward of 1958, the workers of the Dalian Shipyard spent only a few months building the 5,000-ton freighter "Peace No. 25." In 1959, China's own designed 10,000-ton freighter was launched, and recently China's shipyards have been actively building ocean-going vessels. At this time, reviewing some fragments of materials about ships in China for thousands of years is still an interesting thing.
    When did China begin to have ships? Legend has it that the Yellow Emperor ordered Gong Gu to hollow out wood to make boats, which is difficult to confirm, but it also shows that the appearance of boats was very early. By the Yin Dynasty, 3,000 years ago, people often used ships to transport goods and conduct trade. There is an inscription on a large bronze ding with a gluttonous pattern from the Yin Dynasty, which is an image of a person carrying shells in front and back standing on a boat, with a hand holding an oar and rowing behind, which is a vivid and powerful evidence.
    Archaeologists have discovered many ship models from the Han Dynasty, which show that shipbuilding at that time was very advanced. The wooden boat model in the Western Han Tomb in Changsha has slightly upturned bows and sterns, a curved bottom, three cabins, and sideboards on both sides. It is equipped with sixteen oars and a rudder with a knife-shaped blade. A wooden boat unearthed in Guangzhou is smaller in scale, with only four oars and one rudder, but it is equipped with five wooden figurines, making gestures of rowing, steering, and driving the boat forward. Another pottery boat from the Eastern Han Dynasty in Guangzhou is exquisitely made and complex in structure, with a total length of nearly 55 centimeters, with a vaulted front cabin and several cabins with ridged roofs. In addition to the rudder at the stern, the bow is also hung with an anchor, which seems to be a step further than the Western Han Dynasty.
    In ancient times, ships were often used for combat. At that time, the scale of warships was not small. During the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, buildingships more than ten feet high could be built. The Book of Jin records that the warship built by Wang Jun could carry 2,000 people. By the Sui and Tang Dynasties, the scale of warships was even larger. Yang Su of the Sui Dynasty built a "five-tooth" battleship, which had five floors and was more than a hundred feet high. The striking poles on the ship used to hit enemy ships were each fifty feet high.
    In the copy of the Luoshen Fu Tu painted by Gu Kaizhi of the Jin Dynasty, there is a beautiful two-story pavilion ship, which shows the situation of the ruling class enjoying themselves on yachts at that time. As for the emperor's dragon boat, it was even more luxurious. Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty built hundreds of ships, the largest of which was forty-five feet high, fifty feet wide, and two hundred feet long, with four floors of cabins. The upper floor had a main hall, an inner hall, and east and west courts. The middle two floors had more than a hundred rooms, all decorated with exquisite彩画 (colorful paintings). This fact, on the one hand, reveals the luxury and shamelessness of the rulers, and on the other hand, it also shows that the shipbuilding technology of our working people had reached a very high level at that time.
    In addition to ships using sails and oars, Zu Chongzhi of the Jin Dynasty invented a "thousand-mile ship." This ship could travel a hundred miles a day during its trial voyage, which was a "wheel boat" that used rotating wheels to propel water forward. By the Tang Dynasty, the warship built by Li Gao in Hongzhou, "clamped with two wheels and stepped on them, as fast as hanging sails," was this kind of "wheel boat." On this basis, the Yang Mo rebel army in Dongting Lake during the Song Dynasty built a warship with four wheels propelling water, which moved as fast as flying. In addition to combat, there were also "wheel boats" in West Lake in Hangzhou during the Southern Song Dynasty, which were driven by wheels and pedals.
    During the Sui and Tang Dynasties, the economy was prosperous, and the inland waterway ships dedicated to canal transportation and commerce were also of considerable scale. At that time, inland waterway ships generally had a carrying capacity of eight or nine thousand shi, and some were even larger. The National History Supplement records "...during the Dali and Zhenyuan periods, Yu Da Niang's ship was the largest, where residents lived, died, married, and were buried. The opening of the port was a garden, and hundreds of workers were employed for driving." This shows the prosperity of inland waterway transportation at that time.
    After the Tang and Song Dynasties, ocean voyages became increasingly frequent, and Chinese merchant ships were active in the vast waters of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. According to the records of Xu Jing of the Northern Song Dynasty, the passenger ships going to sea at that time were "more than ten feet long and three feet deep, and could carry two thousand hu of grain." The main warehouses and 篷屋(awning houses) were more than ten feet high. The large masts on the ship were ten feet high, and the head masts were eight feet high. There were various sails such as cloth sails, awnings, and small sails, which could sail freely even if the wind direction was different. Each boat had about sixty sailors. The application of the compass, one of China's great inventions, to navigation paved the way for ocean voyages. By the Ming Dynasty, the treasure ships Zheng He rode on when he went to the "Western Ocean" were as long as forty-four feet and as wide as eighteen feet. As for the ship that Lu Kan used to envoy to Ryukyu in the sixteenth year of Jiajing (1537), although it was only fifteen feet long and two feet six feet wide, it is estimated that its carrying capacity was also around a thousand tons. Until the seventeenth century, Chinese sailing ships with flat bottoms, curved sides, and wide beams still maintained a world-leading level in design. In 1605, the Spanish Governor-General of the Philippines built a large number of Chinese-style sailing ships.
    However, under the long-term feudal rule, China's shipbuilding industry gradually lagged behind, so that after the nineteenth century, China's ocean-going sailing ships could not compete with the merchant ships of Western capitalist powers in terms of technology and performance.
    After the Opium War, some upper-level rulers of the Qing Dynasty also ran some "foreign affairs" in order to maintain the corrupt dynasty and suppress the people. In the fifth year of Tongzhi (1866), Zuo Zongtang spent more than 300,000 taels of silver to establish the Fuzhou Shipping Administration Bureau in Mawei, Fujian, which was the largest shipyard at that time. After construction began, more than a dozen large and small ships were built, forming the Fujian Navy. However, during the Sino-French War, due to the Qing government's traitorous capitulationism, all the dozen or so warships of the Fujian Navy were sunk by the French army, and the shipyard in Mawei was also destroyed.
    After the Qing Dynasty, there were years of warlord melee and the dark rule of the Kuomintang reactionary group. China never had a real shipbuilding industry. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party and with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, the shipbuilding industry of New China has flourished. Various types of ships designed and manufactured by ourselves have long been sailing throughout the country, serving socialist construction. Soon, the giant ships of New China will carry the friendship of the Chinese people to every corner of the world. (Attached pictures)

    造船小史
    非白
    1958年全国大跃进声中，大连造船厂的职工仅用几个月的时间修造了五千吨海轮“和平25号”。1959年，我国自己设计的万吨海轮又下了水，最近我国的造船厂正在积极修造远洋大船。在这个时候重温我国几千年来有关船舶的一些片断材料，还是一件饶有趣味的事。
    我国什么时候开始有船？传说黄帝命共鼓化狐刳木为舟，虽难确信，却也说明船的出现是很早的了。到距今三千年前的殷代，人们就常用船只装运财货和进行贸易。在一件殷代饕餮纹大铜鼎内有个铭文，是一个前后挑着贝的人站在船上的形象，后面刻着一只手持桨划船，正是一个生动有力的证据。
    考古工作者发现过不少两汉时期的船只模型，它们表示出当时舟船的制造已很进步。长沙西汉墓中的木船模型，首尾微翘，船底呈弧形，上有三间舱房，两侧装舷板。备有十六只棹和一支叶呈刀形的舵。广州出土的一只木船规模较小，只有四桨一舵，但是上面安设着五个木俑，作出操桨握舵驾船前进的姿态。广州的另一只东汉陶舟，制作精致，结构复杂，全长近五十五厘米，设有拱顶的前舱和几间有起脊屋顶的舱房，除船尾有舵外，船头还悬着船锚，看来较西汉时又进了一步。
    古代，船只常被用来作战。当时战船的规模并不小，汉武帝时已能建造高十余丈的楼船了。晋书载王浚所建战船可以乘载两千人。到隋唐时期，战船规模更大，隋杨素建造了“五牙”大舰，上有楼五层，高百余尺，船上用来撞击敌船的拍竿，各高五十尺。
    晋顾恺之画的洛神赋图摹本中，有只两层楼阁的大船，很漂亮，可以看出当时统治阶级乘游艇享乐的情状。至于皇帝的龙舟，就更富丽奢华了。隋炀帝时造了几百艘船，其中最大的龙舟高四十五尺，阔五十尺，长二百尺，有舱房四层，上一层有正殿、内殿和东西朝堂，中二重有一百多个房间，都装饰了精美的彩画。这一事实，一方面揭露出统治者的奢侈无耻，另方面也显示了我国劳动人民的造船技术在当时就已有很高的水平。
    除了用帆、桨的船外，晋祖冲之发明了一种“千里船”。这种船在试航时可日行百里，这是一种用转轮激水前进的“轮船”。到了唐代，李皋在洪州造出的战舰，“挟两轮踏之，疾若挂帆席”，正是这种“轮船”。在这基础上，宋代洞庭湖中的杨么起义军，建成以四轮激水，其行如飞的战船。除作战外，南宋时杭州西湖中也有这种用车轮脚踏而行的“车船”往来行驰。
    隋、唐时代，经济繁荣，专供漕运及经商的内河航船亦具相当规模。当时内河航船一般载重量达八九千石，也有更大的。国史补记“……大历、贞元间有俞大娘航船最大，居者养生送死嫁娶悉在其间。开港为圃、操驾之工数百。”可见当时内河航运之盛。
    唐宋以后，远洋航行日渐频繁，中国的商船活跃在太平洋、印度洋的广大海域内。据北宋徐竞的记载，当时出洋的客舟是“其长十余丈，深三丈，可载二千斛粟”，其主仓和?屋，高丈余。船上的大樯高十丈，头樯高八丈，有布颿、利篷、小颿等各色风帆，虽风向不同，仍可行驶自如。每舟水手约六十人。由于我国伟大发明之一的指南针之用于航海，更为远洋航行准备了条件。到了明代，郑和下“西洋”所乘的宝船，更长达四十四丈，宽十八丈。至于嘉靖十六年（1537年）陆侃使琉球的乘船虽只长十五丈，阔二丈六尺，但估计载重量也在千吨左右。直到十七世纪以后，平底、侧舷弯曲、横梁宽大的中国帆船，在设计上仍居世界先进水平。1605年西班牙菲律宾总督曾建造了大批中国式帆船。
    但在长期的封建统治下，中国的造船工业逐渐落后，以致十九世纪以后，中国的远洋帆船在技术和性能方面都无法和西方资本主义列强的商船相抗衡了。
    鸦片战争后，一些清朝上层统治者为了维护腐朽的王朝，镇压人民，也办了些“洋务”。同治五年（1866年）左宗棠用了三十余万两银子在福建马尾创立了当时规模最大的造船厂——福建船政局。开工以后造了大小十几艘轮船，组成了福建水师。但到中法战争时，由于清廷的卖国投降主义，福建水师的十几艘军舰全部被法军击沉，在马尾的造船厂也被轰毁。
    清朝以后，接着是连年的军阀混战和国民党反动集团的黑暗统治，我国一直没有真正的造船工业。解放以后，在党的领导下，在苏联无私的援助下，新中国的造船事业蓬勃发展，我们自己设计和制造的各式舰轮，早已驶行在全国各地，为社会主义建设服务。不久，新中国的巨轮将会把中国人民的友谊载运到世界各个角落去。（附图片）
