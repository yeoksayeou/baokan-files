Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 10th: Shandong is promoting the spirit of great collaboration of "prioritizing the outside over the inside" and is continuously transferring pig iron to support key enterprises in Shanghai and other places. In the past five months, the province has transferred nearly 500,000 tons of pig iron to supply Shanghai and other places, an increase of more than 70% compared with the same period last year.

The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has always attached great importance to the transfer of pig iron and has repeatedly instructed relevant departments to resolutely complete this task and has continuously conducted supervision and inspection. In order to better complete this task, the Provincial Committee has recently stipulated that in the order of pig iron distribution, external transfer should be ranked first.

All localities and relevant departments in the province have also taken practical and effective measures to implement the instructions of the Provincial Committee and ensure the completion of the external transfer of pig iron.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 10th: Steel plants, stations, and ports in Anhui Province are closely cooperating to vigorously promote the external transfer of pig iron, ensuring the needs of key enterprises in Shanghai and other places for steelmaking. The province transferred a total of 120,000 tons of pig iron in May, an increase of 12.2% compared with April; of which more than 104,900 tons were transferred to Shanghai. In the first nine days of June, the province's external transfer of pig iron increased by 3,849 tons compared with the same period last month.

Since entering May, leading cadres of the transportation system in various parts of Anhui have gone deep into the front lines to personally grasp the work of iron transfer. They make arrangements (plans) every five days, arrange once a day, grasp twice a day, and promptly discover and help solve specific problems such as transportation equipment and labor. Steel plants, handling, shipping, railway and other departments in various parts of Anhui Province have closely cooperated, which has greatly accelerated the progress of iron transfer.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 10th: Henan Province has transferred a large amount of pig iron to support key iron and steel enterprises in Beijing, Daye, Shanghai and other places for steelmaking and other needs. From January to the end of May, the province's external transfer of pig iron increased by 30.7% compared with the same period last year. In the first week of June, the average daily external transfer of pig iron increased by 16% compared with the average daily external transfer volume in May.

Vigorously grasping transportation is an important reason why Henan's external transfer of pig iron is more, faster, and better. To this end, the province convened a meeting of the directors of the Joint Transportation Office in late May to make special arrangements. After the meeting, the external transfer of pig iron transportation greatly improved. From the end of May to June 7, the average daily transportation volume more than doubled.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 10th: Jiangsu Province, in the spirit of prioritizing the outside over the inside, transported 40% of the iron produced from January to May to Shanghai to ensure the production of key national iron and steel enterprises. At present, the transfer of pig iron is still in progress.

Since the beginning of this year, although Jiangsu's pig iron production has increased significantly, with the further development of industrial and agricultural production, especially the increased task of supporting agricultural technological transformation, the demand for pig iron has also greatly increased. Under such circumstances, all localities in the province still resolutely adhere to the spirit of prioritizing the outside over the inside, prioritizing national key points and then guaranteeing their own production, and first transferring the best pig iron to Shanghai steelmaking enterprises.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 10th: Jiangxi Province resolutely implements the idea of ​​the whole country as a chess game. From January to May this year, the amount of pig iron transferred to Shanghai has reached 50,932 tons, which is 143.3% of the amount transferred to Shanghai in the same period last year, supporting Shanghai's steelmaking industry. At present, the province is still vigorously transferring.

The party committees of relevant areas in Jiangxi Province have strengthened the leadership, supervision and inspection of the pig iron transfer work, organized production and transportation departments to closely cooperate and connect with each other, so as to achieve production, concentration, and transportation.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 10th: Fujian Province is concentrating its efforts to transfer pig iron to support Shanghai steelmaking. In early June, the province's support for Shanghai's pig iron was equivalent to the total of April and May.

The Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China personally grasped the work of pig iron transfer, resolutely implemented the policy of prioritizing the outside over the inside, and first ensured the completion of the external transfer task. The Fujian Provincial Transportation Command, in accordance with the instructions of the Provincial Committee, uniformly arranged the transportation of materials to ensure that pig iron was continuously transported to Shanghai.

    全局第一　重点第一  密切协作　调铁保钢
    山东安徽河南江苏江西福建  快运多运生铁支援重点钢厂
    据新华社济南10日电　山东各地发扬“先外后内”的大协作精神，正在源源调运生铁支援上海等地重点企业。在过去的五个多月里，全省已调出了将近五十万吨生铁供应了上海等地，比去年同期增加了70％以上。
    中共山东省委对外调生铁一贯非常重视，屡次指示有关部门坚决完成这项任务，并且不断进行督促检查。为了使这项任务完成得更好，省委最近又规定，在生铁分配的次序上，把外调列于第一位。
    省内各地和各有关部门为贯彻省委指示，保证完成外调生铁任务，也都采取了切实有效的措施。
    据新华社合肥10日电　安徽省各地钢铁厂、车站、港口密切配合，狠抓生铁外调工作，保证上海等地重点企业炼钢的需要。全省5月份共调出生铁十二万吨，比4月份增长12．2％；其中调往上海的即有十万四千九百多吨。6月份开头九天，全省外调生铁又比上月同期增加了三千八百四十九吨。
    进入5月以来，安徽各地运输系统领导干部纷纷深入现场，亲自抓调铁工作。他们每五天一布置（计划），一天一安排，一天抓两次，及时发现和帮助解决运具、劳力等具体问题。安徽省各地钢铁厂、搬运、航运、铁路等部门，密切协作，也大大加快了调铁进度。
    据新华社郑州10日电　河南省调出大批生铁支援北京、大冶、上海等地重点钢铁企业炼钢以及其它方面的需要。从1月至5月底，全省外调的生铁比去年同期增加30．7％。6月第一周平均每天外调的生铁又比5月份平均日外调量增长16％。
    大抓交通，是河南生铁外调又多、又快、又好的重要原因。为此省里曾在5月下旬召开运输联合办公室主任会议，专门进行了部署。会后，生铁外调运输大有起色，从5月底到6月7日，平均日运量比过去猛增一倍以上。
    据新华社南京10日电　江苏省本着先外后内的精神，在1至5月将所产生铁的40％运给上海，确保国家重点钢铁企业的生产。目前，生铁调运工作还在进行。
    今年以来，江苏生铁产量虽然有了较大的增长，但是随着工农业生产的进一步发展，特别是支援农业技术改造任务的加重，生铁的需要量也大大增加。在这种情况下，省内各地仍旧坚决本着先外后内，先保国家重点、后保自己生产的精神，把最好的生铁首先调给上海炼钢企业。
    据新华社南昌10日电　江西省坚决贯彻全国一盘棋的思想，今年1至5月调往上海的生铁已达五万零九百三十二吨，为去年同期外调上海数量的143．3％，支援了上海炼钢工业。目前省内还在大力调运。
    江西省各有关地区的党委对生铁调运工作加强了领导和督促检查，组织生产和运输部门紧密配合，相互衔接，做到随生产、随集中、随运输。
    据新华社福州10日电　福建省正在集中力量，调运生铁支援上海炼钢。6月上旬全省支援上海的生铁，相当于4、5两个月的总和。
    中共福建省委亲自抓紧生铁调运工作，坚决贯彻先外后内的方针，首先保证外调任务完成。福建省交通指挥部根据省委的指示，统一安排了物资运输，保证生铁陆续运到上海。
