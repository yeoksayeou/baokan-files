    Do a Good Job in Rural People's Commune Health Work
    Xu Yunbei, Vice Minister of Health

    At present, the rural people's communes are moving forward on the road of sound development. On the basis of two consecutive years of great leaps forward in China's socialist construction, a new stage of sustained leaps forward at a higher speed has begun; under the principle of developing the national economy with agriculture as the foundation and with the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, the technological transformation of agriculture has unfolded in a magnificent manner. Health work must keep up with this new situation and continue to leap forward along with the leaps forward in industrial and agricultural production.

    In this new situation, health work must more clearly proceed from the development of production, coordinate with production, and serve production. Under the leadership of the Party, we should continue to widely and deeply mobilize the masses, coordinate all aspects, make great fanfare, create momentum, and carry out health campaigns centered on eliminating the four pests, promoting hygiene, and eliminating major diseases with the revolutionary spirit of changing customs and transforming the world. We should complete the tasks of eliminating pests and diseases as stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, improve the people's health, and establish a new social custom of taking hygiene as glory and unhygienic behavior as shame. Doing a good job in hygiene in collective production and life is the central issue of current rural health work. We should combine agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries with seasonal characteristics to do a good job in labor protection and hygiene in collective production such as in the fields, water conservancy projects, and transportation construction sites. The health work of commune-run industries must be given attention and actively carried out. Rural public canteens are increasingly becoming the center of people's political, economic, and cultural life, and are forming a "one-stop" situation centered on canteens, including collective living welfare undertakings such as nurseries, kindergartens, clubs, barbershops, bathhouses, supply and marketing cooperatives, and sewing groups. Health work must also form a "one-stop" service. First of all, we must eliminate the four pests and promote environmental hygiene in the canteens, ensuring that "no flies are seen during the day and no rats are seen at night." Every aspect of collective life must have specific content and requirements for health work, with dedicated or part-time health workers, and effective measures should be taken to actively prevent diseases. Managing manure well is extremely important for preventing parasitic diseases, intestinal infectious diseases, and improving environmental hygiene. Public toilets and manure storage pools should be established in conjunction with fertilizer accumulation and biogasification, with dedicated personnel for management. Attention should also be paid to arranging work and rest, ensuring that there is both work and rest, so that commune members can engage in production energetically and rhythmically. With the development of socialist new rural construction, health work must cooperate with basic construction to make new residential areas more suitable for hygiene requirements.

    Strengthen the Construction of Commune Health Organizations

    In order to adapt to the needs of the situation and better carry out the health work of rural people's communes, a more complete health care network closely integrated with production is needed from the county to the production team. We need a health workforce that combines Chinese and Western medicine, combines high, middle, and primary health personnel, and combines full-time and part-time health personnel.

    The commune health organization is the center of the rural health care network. The establishment of commune health organizations should be based on the characteristics of rural areas, starting from serving production and facilitating the masses. Health organizations should be established at all levels from the commune to the production team, linking one to another, and gradually creating a set of systems and working methods that meet the needs of the production and life of the people's communes and are welcomed by the vast number of commune members. In terms of organizational structure, generally, the commune establishes a health center (hospital), the production brigade establishes a health station (health center), and the production team establishes a health room (health center) composed of part-time health personnel, connecting with a wide range of mass health work backbones and activists (health workers, midwives, childcare workers, cooks, feeders, manure managers, Red Cross members, etc.). Mountainous areas and ethnic minority areas should actively establish appropriate health organizations according to the characteristics of their regions.

    Maternity hospitals are also a collective health and welfare undertaking run by the commune. They should be actively run well. In some places, midwifery groups or midwives can also be appropriately set up. The maternity hospitals, midwifery groups, and midwives should all be under the unified leadership of the health centers.

    Nurseries and kindergartens are an important part of the commune's collective living welfare undertakings. In the future, collective living will become the main way of life in socialist society, and childcare organizations will inevitably develop further. Commune health organizations should vigorously strengthen the professional leadership of nurseries and kindergartens, train childcare workers with health knowledge in a planned way, and cooperate with relevant departments to truly run nurseries and kindergartens well. Children should truly receive better upbringing than at home, and the vast number of women can concentrate on production labor and political and cultural studies. Some places combine maternity hospitals, nurseries, and kindergartens, which is more convenient to strengthen leadership, save manpower and material resources, and better carry out maternal and child health care work. This method can be promoted in various places in combination with specific situations.

    At present, commune health organizations should focus on actively running commune health centers well, and should gradually strengthen the technical force and medical equipment of commune health centers. Production brigade health stations should strive to be established universally within a certain period, and maternity hospitals should carry out consolidation and improvement work.

    Commune health centers and stations are collective health and welfare undertakings run by the people's communes, and are an indispensable part of the people's communes protecting people's health and ensuring production. In financial management, the principle of "running undertakings diligently and frugally" should be implemented, but it should not be regarded as a sideline or enterprise management.

    The Main Tasks of Commune Health Centers and Stations

    Commune health centers and stations are comprehensive health institutions, responsible for various health tasks such as medical treatment, prevention, health and epidemic prevention, maternal and child health care, and health propaganda and education in the entire commune and team. They must clearly establish the viewpoint of serving production and serving commune members, conscientiously implement the principle of "prevention first," and do a good job in health work in collective production and life centered on eliminating the four pests, promoting hygiene, and eliminating major diseases. The specific tasks can be roughly summarized as follows:

    (1) Under the leadership of the Commune (Production Brigade) Party Committee, put forward plans for health work according to the central focus of production in each period. Proceed from the development of production, cooperate with production, actively carry out mass health campaigns centered on eliminating the four pests, promoting hygiene, and eliminating major diseases, and provide timely technical guidance in the campaigns.

    (2) Improve the service attitude of health personnel, improve the quality of medical treatment, combine with production, go deep into the fields and construction sites, divide areas and assign responsibilities, universally promote mobile medical services, and actively carry out prevention work.

    (3) Designate special personnel to be responsible for and conscientiously do a good job in the hygiene work of collective living units (mainly public canteens, kindergartens, nurseries, schools, etc.), do a good job in manure management, and cooperate with relevant departments to do a good job in labor protection and hygiene work in construction sites, fields, and factories and mines.

    (4) Actively prevent and control acute infectious diseases and local diseases that most seriously endanger the people. Discover diseases in a timely manner, take prevention and control measures in a timely manner, and report epidemics in a timely manner.

    (5) Promote new methods of delivery, publicize scientific knowledge of child-rearing, strengthen women's labor protection, and carry out maternal and child health care work.

    (6) Carry out health propaganda, popularize health knowledge, cultivate part-time mass health backbones and activists in a planned way through various methods, regularly guide and help them carry out mass health work, and continuously improve their health knowledge level.

    (7) Organize the political and professional learning of commune health personnel, participate in certain production labor; and train new medical personnel by taking apprentices and other methods.

    (8) Cooperate with relevant departments to formulate production plans for Chinese medicinal materials, actively participate in the production, harvesting, and purchasing of Chinese medicinal materials, do a good job in technical guidance, and strengthen the inspection of drug quality.

    Cultivate New Forces and Improve Technical Level

    The rural health team has developed greatly in the past few years, but both the quantity and quality are far from meeting the needs of the people. We must further implement the principle of "walking on two legs" and adopt various methods to cultivate new forces and improve the political and professional level of in-service health personnel. We must vigorously advocate that county and people's commune hospitals (health centers) run schools, and strive to basically achieve that every county has a secondary health school and most communes have a commune health school within two or three years. County and commune-run schools should adhere to the principle of self-reliance and local materials, advocate that those who are capable be teachers, and the method of sending students from communes, factories and mines, who will return to their original places of work after graduation, to solve the problems of teachers and student sources. Health institutions and medical colleges at all levels should actively strive to cultivate doctors with a higher level for the communes. Taking apprentices is a traditional Chinese method of training Chinese medicine, and experience has proven that it is also feasible for Western medicine. We must continue to encourage Chinese and Western medical personnel to take apprentices, especially the work of elderly Chinese medicine practitioners taking apprentices should be properly arranged, and strive to inherit their academic experience as soon as possible. Widely carrying out spare-time education and organizing cadres to study further is an important method for training and improving health cadres, and should be actively carried out in combination with work, adapting to local conditions and people, and adopting various forms. At present, some adopt the method of teaching layer by layer, learning and teaching at the same time, learning whatever is done; some adopt correspondence courses to organize Chinese medicine practitioners to study and review; some adopt the method of drawing in-service health personnel to hospitals or medical colleges above the county level for rotation training and further study in batches and phases, which are all very good. In recent years, the method of urban medical colleges and hospitals providing technical guidance to rural hospitals at all levels has also been very effective and should be continued to be promoted. Part-time mass health backbones and activists play an important role in rural health work, and should be actively and boldly cultivated in large quantities through various methods, and continuously improved. Health workers are required to understand the basic scientific knowledge of eliminating pests and diseases and promoting hygiene; to master first aid and labor protection knowledge; to master the prevention knowledge of common acute infectious diseases and the prevention and treatment methods of diseases that most seriously endanger the local people.

    Strengthening the unity of Chinese and Western medicine and giving full play to the role of Chinese medicine and Chinese herbal medicine is of particular importance in rural areas. Chinese and Western medicine should help each other, learn from each other, learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, and cooperate closely. It is advocated that Western medicine practitioners voluntarily and actively learn Chinese medicine, and Chinese medicine practitioners with conditions should also learn some basic knowledge of modern medicine. Folk remedies, secret recipes, and empirical prescriptions are an important part of the treasure house of traditional Chinese medicine, and should continue to be explored, sorted out, and studied, and those that are indeed effective should be promoted. Ethnic minority medicine, herbal medicine, and many medical talents with special skills should also be given sufficient attention and their role should be fully发挥.

    Promote the Collective Health Care System

    The medical system of the people's commune is a matter of the development of commune health work, the consolidation of commune health organizations, and the vital interests of commune members in disease treatment. It should be considered from several aspects: the level of local production development, the degree of awareness of the masses, appropriately reducing the burden on the masses, rationally resolving the salary and treatment of medical personnel, strengthening their ideology of serving the people, and gradually developing health undertakings. At present, many places have implemented a collective health care system, that is, the "health care fee" method or "cooperative medical care" mentioned in various places, whereby commune members pay a certain health care fee every year, and only pay a small amount of registration fee or medicine fee for seeing a doctor, and within the possible scope, the commune and production team's public welfare fund subsidizes a part. This is a better medical system to adapt to the current situation. The implementation of the collective health care system is necessary because it is conducive to carrying out health prevention work, conducive to commune members' medical treatment, conducive to consolidating and developing commune health organizations, conducive to production, and is the urgent requirement of the vast number of commune members. It is hoped that all localities will adopt a positive attitude and conscientiously and step by step promote this system.

    Rely on the Leadership of the Party and Serve Production with All Our Strength

    Doing a good job in the health work of the people's commune is a glorious and arduous task. The key lies in strengthening the leadership of the Party and adhering to putting politics in command. Include health work in the overall plan, with dedicated personnel in charge of leadership; continue to strengthen the backbone force of commune health centers and production brigade health stations, and gradually establish and improve the Party's organization and strengthen the Party's leadership. Health personnel must resolutely rely on the leadership of the Party, listen to the Party, conscientiously carry out ideological transformation, implement the Party's principles and policies, regularly ask the Party committee for instructions and report, conscientiously study Mao Zedong Thought, take Mao Zedong Thought as the guide for our actions, and establish the ideology and work style of wholeheartedly serving the people's commune, serving production, and serving the people's health. Go deep into production and life, and do a good job in eliminating pests and diseases in the process of production and life.

    When solving the problems of commune health work (such as organizational structure, cadre training, medical system, etc.), there must be consistency in principle, but flexibility in methods and practices, and at the same time, it must be closely combined with the needs and possibilities of production development, and consult with the masses more and adapt to local conditions.

    Strengthening the work of county hospitals is an important measure to strengthen commune health work and support agriculture at present. The county hospital should become the technical guidance center for health care, scientific research, and cadre training in the county, and it is also the advanced outpost on the medical and health front to support agriculture. The direction of the county hospital's work should be oriented towards rural areas and people's communes. It is necessary to establish a system of professional guidance for commune health centers and health stations, and adopt methods such as sending down and transferring up, helping to solve difficult problems, and conducting pilot projects around the center to improve the technical level of commune health centers (stations). In the future, new graduates of higher medical colleges should be assigned a certain proportion to work in county hospitals, and a certain number of experienced health personnel should be transferred or sent down from urban health institutions to county hospitals as backbone personnel in a planned way. Ensure that all major departments of county hospitals are equipped with doctors with a higher level. At the same time, the beds of county hospitals should be expanded in batches and phases. Health institutions at all levels should regard supporting agriculture and supporting the construction of rural health institutions as an important political task, and vigorously support them in terms of cadre training, technical guidance, and medicines and equipment.

    The current situation is extremely good, and the production front has set off a high tide of sustained great leaps forward. The health front must closely cooperate. Let us hold high the glorious banner of the general line, the great leap forward, and the people's commune, resolutely rely on the leadership of the Party, rely on the masses, give full play to the superiority of the people's commune, and push the health work of the people's commune further forward on the existing basis.

    做好农村人民公社的卫生工作
    卫生部副部长　　徐运北
    当前农村人民公社正在健全发展的道路上向前迈进。我国社会主义建设在两年连续大跃进的基础上，已开始了一个更高速度持续跃进的新的阶段；在发展国民经济以农业为基础，工农业并举的方针下，农业技术改造已经波澜壮阔地展开。卫生工作必须跟上这一新的形势，随着工农业生产的跃进继续跃进。
    在这新的形势下，卫生工作必须更加明确从发展生产出发，配合生产，为生产服务。应当在党的领导下，继续广泛、深入地发动群众，各方面配合，大张旗鼓，大造声势，大作宣传，以移风易俗，改造世界的革命精神，开展除四害、讲卫生、消灭主要疾病为中心的卫生运动，提前完成全国农业发展纲要所规定的除害灭病任务，提高人民健康水平，树立以卫生为光荣，以不卫生为耻辱的新的社会风尚。作好集体生产、生活中的卫生工作，是当前农村卫生工作的中心问题。应当结合农、林、牧、副、渔和季节特点，作好田间、水利、交通工地等集体生产中的劳动保护和卫生工作。社办工业的卫生工作必须予以重视，积极作好。农村公共食堂正日益成为人民政治、经济、文化生活的中心，并正在形成以食堂为中心，包括托儿所、幼儿园、俱乐部、理发室、洗澡堂、供销部、缝纫组等集体生活福利事业“一条龙”的形势。卫生工作也必须形成“一条龙”。首先要以食堂为中心大除四害，大搞环境卫生，做到“日不见蝇，夜不见鼠”，并对集体生活的每一环节，都有卫生工作的具体内容和要求，要有专管或兼管卫生工作的人员，采取切实可行的措施，积极预防疾病。管好粪便，对防止寄生虫病、肠道传染病及改善环境卫生，极关重要，应当结合积肥，结合沼气化，建立公共厕所和蓄粪池，实行专人管理。还要注意劳逸安排，做到有劳有逸，使社员能以精力充沛有节奏地进行生产。随着社会主义新农村建设工作的开展，卫生工作必须配合基本建设，使新建居民点更加适合卫生的要求。
    加强公社卫生组织建设
    为了适应形势的需要，更好地开展农村人民公社的卫生工作，从县到生产队需要一个更加健全和生产紧密结合的卫生医疗保健网，需要有一支中西医相结合，高、中、初级卫生人员相结合，脱产与不脱产卫生人员相结合的卫生工作队伍。
    公社卫生组织是农村卫生医疗保健网的中心。公社卫生组织的建立，应当根据农村的特点，从服务生产，便利群众出发，从公社到生产队层层都应建立卫生组织，一环紧扣一环，并逐步创造出一套适合人民公社生产和生活的需要，为广大社员所欢迎的制度和工作方法。在机构设置方面，一般采取公社设卫生院（医院），生产大队设卫生所（保健站），生产队设由不脱产卫生人员组成的卫生室（保健室），下面联系广大的群众卫生工作骨干和积极分子（卫生员、助产员、保育员、炊事员、饲养员、粪管员、红十字会员等）。山区和少数民族地区应当根据本地区的特点，积极建立适宜的卫生组织。
    产院也是公社举办的一种集体卫生福利事业。应当积极办好。有些地方还可适当地设置接生组或助产员，产院、接生组、助产员，在业务上都应受卫生院所统一领导。
    托儿所、幼儿园是公社集体生活福利事业的重要组成部分。今后集体生活将成为社会主义社会的主要生活方式，托儿组织必将更大发展。公社卫生组织要大力加强托儿所、幼儿园的业务领导，有计划地训练有卫生工作知识的保育工作人员，配合有关部门切实把托儿所、幼儿园办好。使儿童真正得到比在家里更好的教养，并使广大妇女能以专心从事生产劳动和政治文化学习。有的地方把妇产院、托儿所、幼儿园结合在一起，更便于加强领导，节约人力物力，和更好地开展妇幼保健工作，各地可结合具体情况推行这种办法。
    目前公社卫生组织应以积极办好公社卫生院为重点，应逐步加强公社卫生院的技术力量和医疗装备。生产大队卫生所应该争取在一定时期普遍建立起来，产院应进行巩固提高的工作。
    公社卫生院、卫生所是人民公社举办的集体卫生福利事业，是人民公社保护人民健康，保证生产不可缺少的组成部分。在财务管理上应当贯彻“勤俭办事业”的方针，但不应当把它当作副业或企业管理。
    公社卫生院、所的主要任务
    公社卫生院、所是综合性的卫生事业机构，负责全社、全队医疗预防、卫生防疫、妇幼保健、卫生宣传教育等各项卫生工作。它必须明确树立为生产服务、为社员服务的观点，认真贯彻“预防为主”的方针，以除四害、讲卫生、消灭主要疾病为中心，做好集体生产生活中的卫生工作。具体任务大体可归纳为如下几项：
    （1）在公社（生产大队）党委领导下，根据各个时期生产的中心，提出卫生工作的规划。从发展生产出发，配合生产，积极开展以除四害、讲卫生、消灭主要疾病为中心的群众卫生运动，并在运动中及时进行技术指导。
    （2）改善卫生人员的服务态度，提高医疗质量，结合生产，深入田间、工地，分片包干，普遍推行巡回医疗，积极开展预防工作。
    （3）指定专人负责，切实作好集体生活单位（主要是公共食堂、幼儿园、托儿所、学校等）的卫生工作，作好粪便管理，配合各有关部门作好工地、田间、厂矿的劳动保护和卫生工作。
    （4）积极防治急性传染病和当地危害人民最严重的疾病。及时发现疾病，及时采取防治措施，并及时报告疫情。
    （5）推行新法接生，宣传科学育儿知识，加强妇女劳动保护，开展妇幼保健工作。
    （6）开展卫生宣传，普及卫生知识，有计划地采取各种方式培养不脱产的群众卫生骨干和积极分子，经常指导和帮助他们开展群众性的卫生工作，并不断提高他们的卫生知识水平。
    （7）组织公社卫生人员的政治业务学习，参加一定的生产劳动；并采取带徒弟等办法培养新的医务人员。
    （8）协同有关部门制订中药材生产规划，积极参加中药材生产、采挖、收购工作，作好技术指导，并加强对药品质量的检验工作。
    培养新生力量，提高技术水平
    农村卫生队伍几年来有了很大的发展，但是无论数量或质量都还远不能满足人民的需要，必须进一步贯彻“两条腿走路”的方针，采取多种多样的方式来培养新生力量和提高在职卫生人员的政治业务水平。要大力提倡县、人民公社医院（卫生院）办学校，争取二三年内基本上达到县县都有中级卫生学校，大部分公社都有公社卫生学校。县、社办校要坚持自力更生就地取材的方针，提倡能者为师，和由公社、厂矿保送学员，毕业后仍回原地工作的办法，解决师资和学生来源问题。各级卫生机构和医药院校都要积极努力为公社培养具有较高水平的医生。带徒弟是我国传统的培养中医的方法，经验证明对西医也是可行的。要继续鼓励中西医务人员带徒弟，尤其老年中医的带徒弟工作要适当安排，力求把他们的学术经验尽快地继承下来。广泛开展业余教育，组织干部进修，是培养提高卫生干部的一个重要方法，应当结合工作因地因人制宜，采取多种形式，积极进行。目前有的采取层层传授，边学边教，作什么学什么的办法，有的采取函授组织中医进修温课，有的采取分期分批抽调在职卫生人员到县以上医院或医学院、校轮训进修等办法，都是很好的。几年来各地的城市医学院校和医院对乡村医院实行逐级的业务技术指导等办法，效果也很好，应继续推广。不脱产的群众卫生骨干和积极分子，在农村卫生工作中起着重要的作用，应该积极地放手地采取各种方式大量培养，不断提高。对卫生员要求能够懂得除害灭病讲卫生的基本科学知识；能够掌握急救和劳动保护知识；能够掌握常见急性传染病的预防知识及危害当地人民最严重的疾病的防治办法。
    加强中西医团结，充分发挥中医中药的作用，在农村中有着特别重要的意义。中医西医应该互相帮助，互相学习，取长补短，密切合作。提倡西医自愿积极地学习中医，有条件的中医也应学习一些现代医学的基础知识。流传民间的单方、秘方、验方是祖国医学宝库的重要组成部分，应继续发掘，整理研究，对确有疗效的加以推广。对于少数民族医、草药医及许多具有一技之长的医药人材，也应予以足够的重视和充分发挥他们的作用。
     推行集体保健医疗制度
    人民公社的医疗制度，是关系公社卫生工作开展，公社卫生组织的巩固，和社员疾病医疗的切身利益的问题。应从当地生产发展水平，群众的觉悟程度，适当减轻群众负担，合理解决医务人员工资待遇，加强他们为人民服务的思想和逐步发展卫生事业等几个方面来考虑。目前许多地方实行了集体保健医疗制度，即各地所说的“保健费”办法或“合作医疗”，每年由社员交纳一定的保健费，看病只交少量挂号费或药费，在可能的范围内，由公社、生产队的公益金补助一部分。这是适应当前形势的一种较好的医疗制度。实行集体保健医疗制度之所以必要，因为它有利于开展卫生预防工作，有利于社员治病，有利于巩固和发展公社的卫生组织，有利于生产，是广大社员的迫切要求。希望各地采取积极的态度，认真地有步骤地推行这一制度。
    依靠党的领导，全力为生产服务
    作好人民公社的卫生工作，是一个光荣的艰巨的任务。关键在于加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅。把卫生工作列入总的规划，有专人分工领导；继续加强公社卫生院和生产大队卫生所的骨干力量，逐步建立和健全党的组织和加强党的领导。卫生人员必须坚决依靠党的领导，听党的话，认真进行思想改造，贯彻执行党的方针政策，经常向党委请示报告，认真学习毛泽东思想，把毛泽东思想作为我们行动的指南，树立全心全意为人民公社服务，为生产服务，为人民健康服务的思想和工作作风。深入生产生活，在生产生活的过程中，做好除害灭病工作。
    各地在解决公社卫生工作的问题时（比如机构设置、干部培养、医疗制度等），既要有原则上的一致性，又要有方式作法上的灵活性，同时必须密切结合生产发展的需要和可能，多和群众商量，因地制宜。
    加强县医院的工作是当前加强公社卫生工作，支援农业的一项重要措施。县医院要成为全县卫生医疗、科学研究的技术指导中心和培养干部的基地，也是当前医药卫生战线上支援农业的前哨阵地。县医院的工作方向，应当面向农村，面向人民公社，要建立对公社卫生院、卫生所的业务指导制度，要采取派下去调上来和帮助解决疑难问题，围绕中心搞试点等办法来提高公社卫生院（所）的技术水平。今后高等医药院校的新毕业生，应分配一定比例到县医院工作，并有计划地从城市卫生机构中抽调一定数量有经验的卫生人员分配或下放到县医院作骨干。作到县医院各主要科室都配备上有较高水平的医生。同时要分期分批扩充县医院的病床。各级卫生机构都要把支援农业支援农村卫生机构的建设当作一项重要的政治任务，从培养干部，技术指导，药品器材等方面大力支援。
    目前形势极为良好，生产战线已掀起了持续大跃进的高潮，卫生战线必须紧密配合。让我们更高地举起总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光辉旗帜，坚决依靠党的领导，依靠群众，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，把人民公社的卫生工作在现有基础上向前推进一步。
