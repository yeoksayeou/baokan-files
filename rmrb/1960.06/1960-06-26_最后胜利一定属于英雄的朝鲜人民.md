Final Victory Will Surely Belong to the Heroic Korean People
Vice Chairman of the China Peace Committee, Liu Ningyi

Ten years ago, on June 25, 1950, U.S. imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea. It usurped the name of the United Nations, gathered sixteen countries, and attempted to eliminate the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in one fell swoop. Immediately afterward, on June 27, 1950, the United States forcibly occupied our sacred territory of Taiwan. The U.S. Seventh Fleet entered the Taiwan Strait, interfering in our internal affairs and threatening our security. At the same time, the United States intensified its arming of Japan, turning Japan into a military base for U.S. aggression, attempting to provoke a new war to realize its wild ambition of dominating Asia and the world.

The Chinese and Korean peoples are peace-loving people, and also resolutely oppose aggression. U.S. imperialism imposed the flames of war on the heads of the Korean people, and the flames of war burned to the Yalu River, and sent planes to bomb Northeast China, directly pointing the spearhead of aggression at our country. The Chinese people could no longer tolerate it, and sent the most outstanding sons and daughters of the motherland—the Chinese People's Volunteers, holding high the great banner of justice of "Resisting America, Aiding Korea, Protecting Our Homes, and Defending the Country," crossed the Yalu River on October 25, 1950, and fought side by side with the Korean People's Army. After three years of arduous and tenacious struggle, the Chinese and Korean people severely attacked the most ferocious enemy in the world—U.S. imperialism and its accomplices, and gave them the severe punishment they deserved, forcing the invaders to sit down and negotiate, and had to sign the armistice agreement. The Korean War ended with the enemy's casualties of 1,090,000 (including 390,000 American soldiers) and unprecedented losses, becoming the biggest defeat in American military history, thus dispelling the superstition that "America cannot be touched" and the myth that "the U.S. military cannot be defeated."

The great victory of the Chinese and Korean peoples in resisting U.S. imperialist aggression set a brilliant example for the people of all countries in dealing with imperialism. It not only defended the independence of Korea and the security of our country, but also disrupted U.S. imperialism's war and aggression plan to dominate the Far East and the world, made a significant contribution to safeguarding world peace, and greatly encouraged the confidence of the people all over the world in opposing imperialist aggression, striving for national independence, and defending peace. This victory fully proves the wise conclusion of Chairman Mao that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. It declared to the people of the world: as long as the people of all countries unite, dare to wage a resolute struggle, and are not intimidated by imperialist war threats, they will surely be able to stop aggression and defend peace. Similarly, it once again more clearly proved that to force the imperialists to accept negotiations and sign agreements, we must be backed by tenacious struggle, and we must constantly be vigilant, thoroughly expose and smash the enemy's various conspiracies and tricks. It can be imagined that if we dare not resolutely struggle, do not resist the aggressors, and only dream of relying on negotiations, there will never be the current situation that is beneficial to peace. On the contrary, the flames of war may spread wider. This experience has great practical significance for the current struggle of the people of all countries against U.S. imperialism. In the Korean War, the Chinese and Korean people defeated a powerful enemy with military equipment inferior to the enemy's, which proves again that the main factors determining a war are not superior weapons, but the nature of the war and the unity and struggle of the people.

The Korean people, in the arduous battle to defeat the ferocious American aggressors, demonstrated a noble heroic spirit and received the infinite respect and warm praise of the people all over the world. The great contributions made by the Korean people to the cause of peace and progress will shine forever in human history. Since the Korean armistice, the Korean people have consistently abided by the armistice agreement and have made unremitting efforts to achieve peaceful reunification of Korea. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has put forward a series of reasonable initiatives to resolve the Korean issue, which have been welcomed and supported by the people of all countries. However, in contrast, U.S. imperialism has always adhered to the war policy. The U.S. aggressor troops not only lingered in South Korea, but also intensified their efforts to wantonly undermine the armistice agreement, obstruct the unification of North and South Korea, and constantly transport new weapons, including atomic weapons, in large quantities into South Korea, stepping up the planning of a new war of aggression. At the same time, U.S. imperialism accelerated the colonization of South Korea, instructed its lackeys to implement fascist terrorist rule in South Korea, turning South Korea into a living hell. The South Korean people could no longer tolerate it and launched a fierce tide of struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, driving the puppet Syngman Rhee off the stage. Now the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its new lackeys continues to develop and deepen. The South Korean people are increasingly aware that only by driving out all the American aggressors can they reunify the divided motherland and obtain national independence and a democratic and free life.

The Chinese people are also pleased to see that under the wise leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and Premier Kim Il-sung, the people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have completely restored the war wounds and are carrying out socialist construction vigorously at the speed of Chollima, and have achieved brilliant achievements in all aspects. In the industrial field, the total industrial output value of the first five-year plan (1957-1961) has been completed two and a half years ahead of schedule. In 1959, the total industrial output value increased by 6.1 times compared with 1949, completely eliminating the past distorted state of industry. In agriculture, socialist cooperation has been fully implemented, water conservancy has been basically completed, and it is now moving towards the glorious goal of basically completing agricultural mechanization by 1962. The Chinese people and the people of all countries sincerely and warmly congratulate and cheer for the brilliant achievements made by the fraternal Korean people in socialist construction. The achievements of the Korean people once again show the unparalleled superiority and great vitality of the socialist system to the people all over the world. Every victory and achievement of the Korean people adds important strength to the cause of defending world peace and promoting human progress, and is a powerful encouragement and support to the Chinese people and the people of all countries.

China and Korea are as closely related as lips and teeth and as closely connected as flesh and blood. The unbreakable fighting friendship forged by the Chinese and Korean people with blood is invincible and is a major guarantee for maintaining peace in the Far East and Asia. In the common cause of opposing U.S. aggression, defending peace, and building socialism, the people of our two countries have been, are, and will always be united, supporting each other, and helping each other. The fraternal friendship between our two countries is constantly being consolidated and developed. The 650 million Chinese people have always firmly supported the just struggle of the Korean people to demand the withdrawal of U.S. aggressor troops from South Korea and strive for the peaceful reunification of their motherland. We fully support the "Appeal to the Peace-Loving People of the World" recently issued by the Korean Peace Committee and other six organizations. We severely condemn and resolutely oppose the crimes of U.S. imperialism in invading Korea.

After suffering a disastrous defeat in the war of aggression against Korea, U.S. imperialism pieced together aggressive blocs in the Far East and around the world, expanded military bases, especially missile bases, constantly created tense situations, and plotted new war conspiracies. U.S. imperialism also wantonly interfered in the internal affairs of various countries everywhere, supported the most reactionary and corrupt forces, and suppressed the patriotic and progressive movements of the people of various countries with violence. U.S. imperialism carried out sabotage and subversive activities against socialist countries, and even military provocations and war threats, seriously threatening peace in the Far East and the world.

Recently, the American bandit leader Eisenhower, after sabotaging the four-nation summit conference, came to the Far East with a conspiracy to plan a new war of aggression. Wherever this plague god goes, disaster follows, and the people there rise up to attack him. The people of the Far Eastern countries taught him a severe lesson, causing the American president to flee in embarrassment and return to his old nest with his tail between his legs. Eisenhower, in this "visit," acted as a negative teacher for the people of the Far Eastern countries, educating the people to further recognize the two-faced tactics of "fake peace, real war preparations" and "fake easing, real aggression" of U.S. imperialism, and the ugly robber face of Eisenhower himself. The ironclad facts have irrefutably proved that the aggressive and bellicose nature of U.S. imperialism has not changed at all, but has only intensified; it has also powerfully exposed the ugly faces of modern revisionists who "powder" and "support" U.S. imperialism and its leader Eisenhower.

Wherever there is imperialist aggression and oppression, there is resistance and struggle of the people. From South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Turkey, to Cuba, the storms of struggle against U.S. imperialism are constantly rising and expanding. Its momentum is so great and fierce, the number of people is so large and widespread, and the struggle is so heroic and tenacious, that they are unprecedented in history. What is particularly important is that this irresistible anti-American patriotic surging wave is happening in places under the strict control of U.S. imperialism, in places where American military bases are dotted, and in places that receive the most dollar "aid," which more powerfully encourages the struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world against imperialist aggression and defending world peace.

Following Syngman Rhee and Menderes being overthrown by the people, another die-hard old lackey of U.S. imperialism, Nobusuke Kishi, has now been defeated by the people. The victory of the Japanese people against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys is a major encouragement to the people of Asia and the world.

At present, the international situation is very favorable to the people of all countries. The forces opposing imperialism and defending world peace are unprecedentedly powerful. U.S. imperialism is in an unprecedentedly isolated position in the encirclement of the vast ocean of the people. As Chairman Mao pointed out, imperialism has done all kinds of bad things, and its lifespan will not be very long. The Chinese people, inspired by the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the three magic weapons of the People's Commune, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and the great leader Chairman Mao, must better exert their efforts, strive for the upstream, leap forward in an all-round way, accelerate socialist construction, and enhance the strength to defend world peace. We will never tolerate U.S. imperialism occupying our sacred territory of Taiwan, and we must liberate Taiwan. The 650 million Chinese people will support with greater strength the struggle of the Korean people to demand the withdrawal of U.S. aggressor troops from South Korea and the peaceful reunification of their motherland. We firmly believe that the reunification of the three thousand miles of the Korean River and Mountains will surely be realized, the American aggressive forces will surely get out of South Korea, and the final victory will surely belong to the heroic Korean people.

Long live the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples!

    最后胜利一定属于英雄的朝鲜人民
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席　刘宁一
    十年前，1950年6月25日，美帝国主义发动了侵略朝鲜的战争。它盗用联合国的名义，纠合十六个国家，妄图一举消灭朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。紧接着，1950年6月27日，美国武装侵占了我国的神圣领土台湾，美帝国主义第七舰队进驻台湾海峡，干涉我国内政，威胁我国安全。同时美国又加紧武装日本，把日本变成美国的进行侵略的军事基地，妄想挑起新的大战，以实现它独霸亚洲和世界的狂妄野心。
    中朝两国人民是热爱和平的人民，也是坚决反对侵略的人民。美帝国主义把战火强加在朝鲜人民的头上，把战火烧到了鸭绿江边，并派飞机轰炸我国东北，把侵略的矛头直接指向我国。我国人民忍无可忍，派遣了祖国最优秀的儿女——中国人民志愿军，高举着伟大的“抗美援朝、保家卫国”的正义大旗，于1950年10月25日跨过鸭绿江，与朝鲜人民军并肩作战。经过三年艰苦顽强的斗争，朝中人民狠狠打击了全世界最凶恶的敌人——美帝国主义及其帮凶，给了它们应得的严厉惩罚，迫使侵略者坐下来谈判，并且不得不在停战协定上签了字。朝鲜战争以敌人一百零九万人（其中有三十九万美军）的伤亡和空前的损失而告终，成为美国军事史上最大的惨败，从而破除了“美国碰不得”的迷信和“美军打不败”的神话。
    朝中人民反抗美帝国主义侵略的伟大胜利，为各国人民对付帝国主义树立了一个光辉的范例。它不仅保卫了朝鲜的独立和我国的安全，并且打乱了美帝国主义妄图独霸远东及世界的战争侵略计划，对保卫世界和平作出了重大的贡献，同时也大大鼓舞了全世界人民反对帝国主义侵略、争取民族独立和保卫和平的胜利信心。这一胜利充分证明了毛主席所说帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的英明论断。它向全世界人民宣告：只要各国人民团结起来，敢于进行坚决的斗争，不为帝国主义的战争威胁所吓倒，就必定能够制止侵略、保卫和平。同样的，它再一次更清楚地证明：要迫使帝国主义者接受谈判和签订协议，必须以顽强的斗争作后盾，必须不断提高警惕，彻底揭露和粉碎敌人的各种阴谋诡计。可以设想，如果不敢坚决进行斗争，不去反抗侵略者，而幻想仅仅依靠谈判，就绝不会出现目前这样有利于和平的局面。相反，战火有可能蔓延更广。这条经验，对于当前各国人民反对美帝国主义的斗争，具有重大的现实意义。在朝鲜战争中，中朝人民以逊于敌人的军事装备，战胜了强大的敌人，这又证明：决定战争的主要因素不是优势的武器，而是战争的性质和人民的团结和斗争。
    朝鲜人民在打败凶恶的美国侵略军的艰苦战斗中，表现了崇高的英雄气概，受到全世界人民的无限尊敬和热烈颂扬。朝鲜人民对和平和进步事业所创立的伟大功勋，在人类历史上将永放光芒。自从朝鲜停战以来，朝鲜人民一贯遵守停战协定，并且为实现朝鲜的和平统一进行了不懈的努力。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府，提出一系列合理解决朝鲜问题的创议，受到了各国人民的欢迎和支持。但是，与此相反，美帝国主义始终坚持战争政策，美国侵略军不仅赖在南朝鲜不走，而且变本加厉，肆意破坏停战协定，阻挠朝鲜南北部的统一，而且不断把包括原子武器在内的新式武器大量运进南朝鲜，加紧策划新的侵略战争。同时，美帝国主义在南朝鲜加速殖民化，指使它的走狗们在南朝鲜实行法西斯恐怖统治，把南朝鲜变成人间地狱。南朝鲜人民忍无可忍，掀起了猛烈的反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争怒潮，把傀儡李承晚轰下了台。现在反对美帝国主义及其新走狗的斗争还在继续开展和深入。南朝鲜人民愈来愈觉悟到，只有把美国侵略者全部赶出去，他们才能使分裂的祖国重新统一。才能得到民族独立，民主自由的生活。
    中国人民还高兴地看到，在朝鲜劳动党和金日成首相的英明领导下，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民已完全恢复了战争创伤，并且正以千里马的速度轰轰烈烈地进行着社会主义建设，并已在各方面取得了辉煌的成就。在工业方面，已经提前两年半完成了第一个五年计划（1957—1961）的工业总产值，1959年工业总产值比1949年提高六点一倍，完全消除了过去工业的畸形状态。农业方面，已完全实行了社会主义合作化，基本上完成了水利化，现在正向1962年基本上完成农业机械化的光荣目标前进。中国人民和各国人民都衷心地、热烈地祝贺和欢呼兄弟的朝鲜人民在社会主义建设中所取得的辉煌成就。朝鲜人民的成就再一次向全世界人民表明社会主义制度的无比优越性和伟大的生命力。朝鲜人民的每一个胜利和成就都给保卫世界和平和促进人类进步事业增添了重要的力量，都是对中国人民和各国人民的有力鼓舞和支持。
    中朝两国是唇齿相依，血肉相连。中国人民和朝鲜人民用鲜血凝结成的牢不可破的战斗友谊，是不可战胜的，是维护远东和亚洲和平的重大保证。在反对美国侵略、保卫和平、建设社会主义的共同事业中，我们两国人民过去、现在和将来永远团结一致，互相支持，互相帮助。我们两国的兄弟友谊正在不断巩固和发展。中国六亿五千万人民一贯坚决支持朝鲜人民要求美国侵略军撤出南朝鲜和争取祖国和平统一的正义斗争。我们完全拥护朝鲜和平委员会等六团体最近发表的“致全世界爱好和平人民的呼吁书”。我们严厉谴责和坚决反对美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的罪行。
    美帝国主义在侵略朝鲜的战争遭受惨败后，在远东和全世界各地拼凑侵略集团，扩建军事基地特别是导弹基地，不断制造紧张局势，策划新战争阴谋。美帝国主义还到处横蛮地干涉各国内政，扶植最反动、最腐朽的势力，并以暴力镇压各国人民的爱国进步运动。美帝国主义对社会主义国家进行破坏、颠覆活动，以至军事挑衅和战争威胁，严重地威胁远东和世界的和平。
    最近，美国强盗头子艾森豪威尔在破坏四国政府首脑会议之后，又怀着策划新的侵略战争阴谋到远东来。这个瘟神到那里，灾难就到那里，那里的人民就群起攻之。远东各国人民狠狠地教训了他一顿，使这位美国总统狼狈奔逃，夹着尾巴滚回了老家。艾森豪威尔在这次“访问旅行”中，充当了远东各国人民的反面教员，教育人民更加认清美帝国主义“假和平、真备战”和“假缓和、真侵略”的两面手法，和艾森豪威尔本人丑恶的强盗面目。铁的事实已经无可辩驳地证明：美帝国主义的侵略好战本性，是丝毫没有改变，而且只有变本加厉；也有力地揭穿了现代修正主义者为美帝国主义和它的头子艾森豪威尔“搽粉”、“捧场”的走狗嘴脸。
    那里有帝国主义侵略压迫，那里就有人民的反抗斗争。从南朝鲜、日本、菲律宾、土耳其，直到古巴，反对美帝国主义的斗争风暴不断兴起和扩大。其声势之浩大和猛烈，人数之众多和广泛，及斗争之英勇和坚韧性，都是历史上空前未有的。具有特别重要意义的是这个不可阻挡的反美爱国的汹涌浪潮，是发生在美帝国主义严密控制的地方，发生在美国军事基地星罗棋布的地方，发生在接收美元“援助”最多的地方，这就更加有力地鼓舞着亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲及全世界人民反对帝国主义侵略、保卫世界和平的斗争。
    继李承晚、曼德列斯被人民轰下台之后，另一个死心塌地的美帝国主义的老走狗岸信介，现在又被人民打倒了。日本人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的胜利，对于亚洲和世界各国人民是一个重大的鼓舞。
    目前，国际形势对各国人民十分有利。反对帝国主义、保卫世界和平的力量空前强大。美帝国主义在人民群众汪洋大海的包围中，陷于空前孤立。正如毛主席所指出的，帝国主义作尽了坏事，它的寿命不会很长了。中国人民在党的总路线、大跃进和人民公社三大法宝的鼓舞下，在党中央和伟大的领袖毛主席的英明领导下，要更好的鼓足干劲、力争上游，全面跃进，加速社会主义建设，增强保卫世界和平的力量。我们决不能容忍美帝国主义侵占我国神圣领土台湾，我们一定要解放台湾。中国六亿五千万人民将以更大的力量，全面支持朝鲜人民要求从南朝鲜撤出美国侵略军和和平统一祖国的斗争。我们深信，朝鲜三千里江山的统一是一定要实现的，美国侵略势力是一定要滚出南朝鲜的，最后胜利一定属于英雄的朝鲜人民。
    中朝两国人民牢不可破的兄弟友谊万岁！
