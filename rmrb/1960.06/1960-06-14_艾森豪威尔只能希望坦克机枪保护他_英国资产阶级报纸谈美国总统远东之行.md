Xinhua News Agency, London, June 13th. Many British bourgeois newspapers today depicted with sarcasm the extremely embarrassing situation of the US President's visit to his puppet friends in Asia. They called Eisenhower's visit a "troublesome visit" and Eisenhower an "unwelcome guest."

The "Daily Herald" reporter John Sampson, in a dispatch from New York today titled "Very Grim-Faced Ike Sets Off on Troublesome Visit," said that although Eisenhower's itinerary in Japan was "unpublished for security reasons," it was "almost certain that he will travel by helicopter from the airport to Tokyo. This will avoid the possible repetition of the scene where White House Press Secretary Hagerty was insulted by ‘anti-visit demonstrators’ last Friday."

Sampson pointed out that Eisenhower's "friendly visit" to Japan has stronger security than any US president in history, because "during his visit, forty-five special agents will serve as his personal guards."

The "Daily Herald" published an article by Ian Aitken on the same day, satirizing Eisenhower's visit to Japan by saying, "The arrangements for this visit have been changed, and it seems very likely that the old gentleman will rush off like Elvis Presley in a helicopter and armored car."

The author mocked, "If I were President Eisenhower, I would ask, how did I get into this hole?
This would not be like a politician, nor would it be stylish, but my curiosity would dominate me. I want to know who dug this hole—who decided I should be pushed into it."

The "Daily Mirror" commentator Cassandra, in an article, said that Eisenhower "can only hope that there are enough tanks, helicopters, machine guns and police to protect him from being attacked by the many people who come to admire him."

The "Guardian" wrote in an editorial today that Eisenhower's Far East trip "will be the least pleasant, possibly the most dangerous visit."

The editorial said, "The atmosphere in which he is conducting the visit must be heartbreaking and disappointing for someone who intends to act as a peacemaker during his presidency."

The "Guardian" said, "He will not be able to avoid receiving blame for Dulles' foreign policy, and unfortunately, the State Department has shown little sign of gradually breaking away from this policy."

The "Guardian" said, "The whole world is watching Tokyo, where the President will face the greatest danger. But there is danger elsewhere." The newspaper believes that in every place Eisenhower is about to visit, "there is a latent anti-American sentiment, and the precedent of the Japanese demonstrators may encourage people to express this sentiment openly."

### 艾森豪威尔只能希望坦克机枪保护他  英国资产阶级报纸谈美国总统远东之行

    艾森豪威尔只能希望坦克机枪保护他
    英国资产阶级报纸谈美国总统远东之行
    据新华社伦敦13日电　英国许多资产阶级报纸今天都以讽刺的口气描绘美国总统访问他在亚洲的傀儡朋友时那种极端尴尬的处境。它们把艾森豪威尔的访问叫做“伤脑筋的访问”，把艾森豪威尔叫做“不受欢迎的客人”。
    “每日先驱报”记者约翰·桑普森今天以“神色非常严峻的艾克出发进行伤脑筋的访问”为题从纽约发出的电讯说，虽然艾森豪威尔访问日本的日程“由于安全原因而不加发表”，但是“几乎可以肯定，他将从机场乘直升飞机到东京。这样将避免上星期五白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂被‘反访问示威者’侮辱的那种场面的可能的重演”。
    桑普森指出，艾森豪威尔对日本的“友好访问”比历史上任何一个美国总统有更强的警卫，因为“在他访问期间，将有四十五名特务人员担任他的私人警卫”。
    “每日先驱报”同一天刊载江·阿卡斯写的一篇文章，挖苦备至地评论艾森豪威尔对日本的访问说，“这次访问的安排已作了改变，看来很可能，这位老绅士将像埃耳维斯·普雷斯莱一样乘直升飞机和防弹汽车急急地跑掉。”
    作者挖苦说，“假使我是艾森豪威尔总统的话，我倒要问问，我怎么会进入这个洞里。
    这将不像是政治家了，也没有气派了，但是我的好奇心支配了我。我想知道，谁掘了这个洞——谁决定应该把我推进这个洞里。”
    “每日镜报”评论员卡桑·德拉在一篇文章中说，艾森豪威尔“只能希望有足够的坦克、直升飞机、机关枪和警察来保护他，使他不至于受到许许多多来瞻仰他的人的攻击”。
    “卫报”今天在社论中写道，艾森豪威尔的远东之行“将是最不令人感到愉快的、可能是最危险的访问。”
    社论说，“他进行的访问的气氛对一个想到用担任总统期间充当和平缔造者的人说来，一定是会感到伤心失望的。”
    “卫报”说，“他将不能不去领受对杜勒斯外交政策的责备，不幸的是，国务院几乎没有表明正在逐步摆脱这种政策的迹象。”
    “卫报”说，“全世界都注视着东京，总统在那里将受到最大的危险。但是在其他地方也有危险。”这家报纸认为，在艾森豪威尔将要访问的每一个地方，“都潜藏着一种反美情绪，而日本示威者的先例，可能鼓励人们公开表示这种情绪。”
