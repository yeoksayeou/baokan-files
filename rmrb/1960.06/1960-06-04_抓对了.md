	Caught it Right
	Li Fu
	Recently, the Party Committee of the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant did something that workers called "caught it right, caught it accurately, and caught the root of the problem," that is, vigorously grasping the normal usage rate of new machinery. At the beginning of April, the factory made a check and statistics: out of the 445 pieces of new equipment successfully trial-produced in the technical revolution movement throughout the factory, only 54.8% were used frequently; 31.9% were used intermittently or rarely; and some were not used at all. This ratio number shocked both the leadership and the masses. The contradiction was revealed, and a great airing of views, great debate, and big-character posters promoted the solution of the problem. More than 100 rarely used new machines were put into operation, and production efficiency immediately improved. The enthusiasm of the workers and masses for making technical revolutions was even higher, and the production plan for the first half of the year was completed ahead of schedule and overfulfilled. This is a very good example of applying the achievements of technical innovation and technical revolution to production generally and promoting a great increase in production.
	Creation is for promotion, for universal application, that is to say, for improving labor productivity, for using the new machines, new equipment, new technologies, and new processes we create to ensure the better completion of the state production plan. Therefore, the birth of a new machine does not mean the end of the revolution. It is also necessary to see whether it is universally applied in production, whether it has improved labor productivity, and whether it is坚持used continuously. Grasping this point is grasping the root of the problem.
	However, to achieve the universal promotion and continuous use of new machines, a general call from the leadership will not be effective. The facts of the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant tell us that this requires the leadership to carry out a lot of meticulous ideological work, organizational work, and technical work. Ideological revolution is the prerequisite for technical revolution. In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, when a new machine is born, the ideological revolution becomes more acute. In the process of promoting and using new machines, the ideological struggle between the advanced and the conservative is more intense. For example, some people think that new tools have this or that shortcoming, and therefore cannot solve big problems, so they do not support or encourage them; some people are bound by the force of habit, and feel that new tools are not easy to use, so they are unwilling to use them, or they stop using them after encountering a little difficulty. From this it can be seen that in the process of promoting new machines, new equipment, new technologies, and new processes, we must continue to strengthen ideological and political work. Otherwise, empty talk about promotion will still not be effective.
	June is the last month of the first half of the year, a month to strive for a substantial increase in industrial production and to strive to complete half of the state's annual plan. Whether production can increase substantially and whether the state plan can be completed depends on an important factor: how well the advanced technologies and advanced experiences created in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement are consolidated and promoted. The Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant has grasped this point correctly, and other enterprises should also vigorously grasp this work.

    抓对了
    黎夫
    最近，太原矿山机器厂党委作了一件被工人称为“抓对了、抓准了、抓住问题的根子了”的工作，那就是狠抓新机具的正常使用率。4月初，这个工厂作了一个检查和统计：全厂在技术革命运动中试制成功的四百四十五台（件）新设备，经常使用的只占54．8％；时用时停和很少使用的占31．9％；还有一些根本没有用。这个比例数字使领导和群众都吃了一惊。矛盾被揭露了，一场大鸣大放大辩论，促进了问题的解决，一百多台很少使用的新机具上阵了，生产效率立即提高了，工人群众大闹技术革命的积极性更高了，上半年的生产计划提前超额完成了。这是把技术革新和技术革命的成果，普遍应用于生产，促进生产大增长的一个很好的例子。
    创造是为了推广，为了普遍运用，也就是说，是为了提高劳动生产率，为了用我们创造出的新机器、新设备、新技术、新工艺来保证国家生产计划的更好完成。因此，一台新机具诞生了，并非革命结束了，还要看它是否在生产中普遍应用，是否提高了劳动生产率，是否坚持使用下去。抓住了这一条才是抓住了问题的根子。
    但是，要作到新机具普遍推广，坚持使用，却不是领导上一般号召所能够奏效的。太原矿山机器厂的事实告诉我们，这需要领导上进行许多细致的思想工作、组织工作和技术工作。思想革命是技术革命的前提。在技术革新和技术革命运动中，一种新机具诞生了，思想革命更尖锐了。在推广、使用新机具的过程中，先进和保守的思想斗争更加剧烈了。例如，有人认为，新工具有这样那样的缺点，因而解决不了大问题，就不支持，不鼓励；还有一些人受习惯势力的束缚，觉得新工具用起来不顺手，因而不愿用，或者用了以后遇到一点困难又不用了。由此可见，在推广新机器、新设备、新技术、新工艺的过程中，必须继续加强思想工作和政治工作。否则空谈推广，仍不能收到实效。
    6月，这是上半年的最后一个月，是力争工业生产大幅度上升、力争完成国家全年计划一半的月份。生产能不能大幅度地增长，国家计划能不能完成，一个重要的因素是，要看技术革新和技术革命运动中创造的先进技术和先进经验巩固、推广得怎么样。太原矿山机器厂抓这一条抓对了，其它的企业也应当狠狠地抓这项工作。
