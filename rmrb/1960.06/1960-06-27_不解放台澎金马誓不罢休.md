We Will Never Stop Until Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu Are Liberated
Lieutenant General Liu Peishan

    On June 27, 1950, while launching the war of aggression against Korea, American imperialism dispatched the U.S. Seventh Fleet to illegally occupy our territory of Taiwan, and it has been a full ten years since then.

    In the past ten years, American imperialism has committed all kinds of evils in Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area, attempting to turn Taiwan into a permanent colony of the United States, into an important military base in the Far East, and especially into a springboard for attacking our mainland. American aggressor troops run rampant and commit all kinds of atrocities in Taiwan, turning our motherland's treasure island—Taiwan—into an economic depression, with people living in misery, diseases rampant, and a hell on earth! This time, the American bandit chieftain Eisenhower came to the Far East amidst the condemnation of the world, and on June 18, climbed onto Taiwan amidst the deafening artillery fire of our army, to promote his war policy and aggression policy. Although this bandit chieftain quickly slipped away under the contempt and scorn of the Chinese people, under the just struggle of patriotic compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu against Eisenhower's bandit trip, and under the bombardment of anti-American armed demonstrations by our front-line troops; for the Chinese people, it has once again sounded the alarm, reminding the Chinese people: Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu must be liberated. As long as American imperialism stays in Taiwan for one day, we will not have peace for one day.

    Fujian and Taiwan face each other across the sea, and are the southeastern barrier of the motherland's mainland and the advanced base for liberating Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu. The military and civilians on the Fujian front have been closely watching the provocations and aggressive activities of American imperialism. In the past ten years, the military and civilians on the Fujian front have clearly seen the various actions of American imperialism, determined to be enemies with the Chinese people to the end: After armed occupation of Taiwan, American imperialism signed the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek clique on December 2, 1954, attempting to legalize the occupation of Taiwan by American imperialism, and using Taiwan as a base to expand its aggression against our country and Southeast Asia; on July 15, 1958, while invading Lebanon, American imperialism instigated the Chiang Kai-shek clique to intensify harassment and sabotage against our country from coastal islands such as Kinmen and Matsu, and then it dispatched a large number of warships and airplanes from its own country and the Mediterranean to create tension in the Taiwan Strait. In October 1958, Dulles went to Taiwan to promote the conspiracy to create "two Chinas". Dulles is dead, but the ambition of American imperialism to annex Taiwan has not died. This time, Eisenhower came to Taiwan after he personally destroyed the four-power summit meeting and gathered lackeys of the Southeast Asia Group in Washington to plan a new war conspiracy in the Far East, extending his bloody claws to the people of Asia and the people of China. We clearly see that for ten years, American imperialism has continued to increase the strength of American troops stationed in Taiwan, build and expand air and naval bases, and accelerate the arming of the Chiang Kai-shek clique's army as a tool for attacking the Chinese people. American imperialism not only instructed the Chiang Kai-shek clique's air and naval forces to carry out harassment and sabotage activities against our mainland and coastal islands, but also directly sent airplanes and warships to invade our country's airspace and territorial waters, and carry out military provocations and war threats against our people. In the most recent year and nine months, incidents of American planes and warships infringing on our country's airspace and territorial waters have reached one hundred and seventy-two, including two hundred and fifty-five invading enemy planes and one hundred and eighty-three various ships. From September 7, 1958 to June 22 this year, the spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been ordered to issue one hundred and thirteen serious warnings to the United States. The armed occupation of Taiwan by American imperialism is not an isolated event, but an integral part of American imperialism's entire policy of aggression and war.

    The Chinese people's resolute struggle against American imperialism's aggression against Taiwan is not only to defend China's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, but also to defend peace in the Far East and the world. From 1950 to 1953, the American aggressors repeatedly attempted to expand the war from Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam to the Chinese mainland. If the Chinese people had not resolutely carried out the just war of resisting America and aiding Korea, and together with the Korean people, driven the American aggressors from the Yalu River back to the 38th parallel, it would not only have been impossible to achieve the armistice in Korea, but also impossible to contain the conspiracy of American imperialism to launch a war in the Taiwan Strait. In 1958, the American aggressors gathered a large number of naval and air forces to the Taiwan Strait to carry out war threats against our people. If the Chinese people had not carried out a resolute struggle, it would not have been possible for the American aggressors to be somewhat apprehensive and dare not act rashly. All the facts of the past ten years tell us that the tension in the Taiwan Strait is entirely created by the United States. As long as the American aggressors withdraw from Taiwan, there will be no tension in the Taiwan Strait at all. Conversely, the reason why the conspiracy of the United States to repeatedly provoke war in the Taiwan Strait has failed in the past ten years is precisely because the Chinese people have insisted on liberating Taiwan and resolutely carried out a just struggle against the American aggressors.

    While maintaining vigilance and resolutely carrying out the struggle against American imperialism's aggression, the Chinese people have always been unremittingly committed to easing international tensions and striving to resolve international disputes through peaceful negotiations. Even under the circumstances of the United States occupying our territory of Taiwan, we still maintain ambassadorial-level negotiations with the United States. The Chinese people's consistent and sincere efforts for peace are obvious to the people of the world. However, now American imperialism is reversing black and white, and falsely accusing the Chinese people of resolutely liberating their own territory of Taiwan as creating tension and being warmongering; modern revisionists, succumbing to the imperialist policy of war blackmail, have even absurdly claimed that the Chinese people's just struggle is "stimulating imperialism." This is actually asking the Chinese people to abandon the just struggle to suit the needs of imperialism. And if this is done, the result will inevitably be to promote imperialism to launch war more frantically, and it can only be to ruin peace. The Chinese people will never do this. We will neither be intimidated nor be fooled. In order to realize the reunification of the motherland and to safeguard world peace, we must liberate Taiwan, and we will certainly be able to liberate Taiwan.

    Taiwan has always been Chinese territory. During the fifty-one years that Japanese imperialism occupied Taiwan, the Taiwanese people never stopped resisting the Japanese bandits and striving to return to the embrace of the motherland. In the ten years that American imperialism has occupied Taiwan, the compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu have suffered the ravages of the American aggressor troops, and the threat of the American government's conspiracy to create "two Chinas" and turn Taiwan into an American colony. They have increasingly realized that imperialism is the most vicious enemy of the Chinese people. The compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu can no longer tolerate the American aggressors continuing to show off their might in Taiwan. The outbreak of the anti-American anger of patriotic compatriots in Taiwan three years ago proved this. Eisenhower's recent bandit trip is arousing even higher anti-American patriotic struggles among the compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu. This American bandit chieftain, on the one hand, came to Taiwan to intensify the planning of war conspiracies, and on the other hand, openly promoted his conspiracy to create "two Chinas". All this is not only intolerable to the patriotic compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, but even those who have been following the United States, facing this situation, cannot but carefully consider their future. It should be seen that the American aggressors have done all the bad things, which has aroused the anger of the people all over the world. It is rapidly going downhill, and its days are getting worse and worse. Eisenhower has become a rat running across the street during this trip to the Far East, and everyone is shouting to beat him. The life of American imperialism will not be very long. Relying on American aggressors is unreliable and untrustworthy. Now is a good opportunity, and all patriotic Chinese should unite, form a broad united front, and resolutely struggle against the common enemy of the Chinese people and the people of the world, the American aggressors; drive the American aggressors out of Taiwan and realize the reunification of the motherland!

    The ten years since the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea and armed occupation of our territory of Taiwan have been ten years of failure of the United States' policy of aggression and war everywhere in the world. The era in which American imperialism ran rampant in front of the people of the world and the Chinese people has gone forever. A series of inspiring events have recently taken place in the world: Syngman Rhee, Menderes, and Nobusuke Kishi have all been driven off the stage by the people, and American imperialism has fallen into "besieged on all sides". All imperialists and reactionaries are always digging their own graves. The more vicious they are, the more they arouse the revolutionary will of the people. The more their aggressive activities expand, the more nooses are tied around their necks. The more frantic their provocative activities are, the tighter the noose they hand over to the people becomes. American imperialism continues to adhere to the policy of aggression and insisting on making nooses to put around its own neck. The result can only be: the day when it is sentenced to hang by the people of the world is getting closer and closer.

    The days of American imperialism are indeed getting worse and worse. However, American imperialism's aggressive nature and war policy will never change because of this. Modern revisionists say that as long as the "distrust" of imperialism is eliminated, imperialism will give up pursuing its own goals through war. This is really shameless and absurd! American imperialism will never "lay down the butcher knife". This is determined by its class nature and corrupt system, and has been proved by historical facts, especially by the facts of the past ten years. From the beginning of the twentieth century to the present, the United States has changed nine presidents, including three Democrats and six Republicans, and a total of sixteen secretaries of state, including Hull. When have we ever seen American imperialism abandon its policy of aggression? No! American imperialism's policy of aggression has not only not changed, but has become more and more blatant. We must never fantasize about peace and be fooled by the imperialists' false peace and real preparation for war!

    The military and civilians on the Fujian front deeply know that the imperialist system is the root cause of modern war. As long as imperialism exists, the threat of war can never be eliminated. We have not forgotten for a moment that American imperialism still occupies our territory of Taiwan by force. American imperialism has recently conducted large-scale military exercises in the Far East, some of which are openly directed against our country. When Eisenhower "visited" Taiwan, he recklessly clamored to "defend" Kinmen and Matsu. All officers and soldiers of the Fujian front troops must strengthen their vigilance under the leadership of the Party and with the support of the people, accelerate the construction of our army, thoroughly crush any provocation and sabotage activities of American imperialism, and resolutely fight for the liberation of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, defend the motherland, and defend world peace. We will never stop until we reach our goal!

    不解放台澎金马誓不罢休
    中将　刘培善
    1950年6月27日，美帝国主义在发动侵朝战争的同时，派遣美国第七舰队，非法侵占我国领土台湾，至今已经整整十年。
    十年来美帝国主义在台湾及台湾海峡地区作尽了坏事，它企图把台湾变成美国的永久殖民地，变成它在远东的重要军事基地，特别是变成进攻我国大陆的跳板。美国侵略军在台湾横行霸道，无恶不作，把我们祖国的宝岛——台湾，摧残成为一个经济萧条、民不聊生、疾病流行、惨绝人寰的人间地狱！这次美国强盗头子艾森豪威尔在举世唾骂声中来到了远东，并于6月18日在我军震天动地的炮火中爬上了台湾，推行他的战争政策和侵略政策。虽然这个强盗头子在我国人民的鄙视和蔑视之下，在台澎金马爱国同胞反对艾森豪威尔强盗旅行的正义斗争下，在我前线部队反美武装大示威的炮火轰击下，很快溜走了；但对于中国人民来说，却又一次敲起了警钟，它提醒中国人民：台澎金马一定要解放。美帝国主义赖在台湾一天，我们就一天不能安宁。
    福建和台湾隔海相望，是祖国大陆的东南屏障，是解放台澎金马的前进基地，福建前线军民一直密切注视着美帝国主义的挑衅和侵略活动。十年来福建前线军民清楚地看到了美帝国主义决心与中国人民为敌到底的种种行径：美帝国主义在武装侵占台湾之后，于1954年12月2日同蒋介石集团签订了所谓“共同防御条约”，企图使美帝国主义侵占台湾合法化，并以台湾为基地扩大对我国和东南亚的侵略；1958年7月15日美帝国主义在侵略黎巴嫩的同时，唆使蒋介石集团从金门马祖等沿海岛屿加紧对我国的骚扰和破坏，接着它又从本国和地中海调派了大批军舰和飞机在台湾海峡制造紧张局势。1958年10月，杜勒斯到了台湾，推行制造“两个中国”的阴谋计划。杜勒斯死了，美帝国主义并吞台湾的野心并没有死。这次艾森豪威尔又在他亲手破坏四国首脑会议及在华盛顿纠集东南亚集团的仆从策划远东新战争阴谋之后，来到了台湾，向亚洲人民和中国人民伸出血腥的魔手。我们清楚地看到：十年来美帝国主义还不断增加侵台美军的兵力，修建和扩建空海军基地，并且加紧武装蒋介石集团的军队作为它进攻中国人民的工具。美帝国主义不但指使蒋介石集团的海空军对我国大陆和沿海岛屿进行骚扰和破坏活动，而且还直接派飞机军舰侵犯我国的领空、领海，向我国人民进行军事挑衅和战争威胁。在最近一年零九个多月中，美国飞机军舰侵犯我国领空领海的事件已达一百七十二次，其中入侵的敌机达二百五十五架，各种舰只一百八十三艘。从1958年9月7日至今年6月22日我外交部发言人已奉命向美国提出了一百一十三次严重警告。美帝国主义武装侵占台湾不是一件孤立的事件，它是美帝国主义整个侵略政策和战争政策的一个组成部分。
    中国人民为反对美帝国主义侵略台湾而进行的坚决斗争，这不但是为了保卫中国的独立、主权和领土的完整，而且也是为了保卫远东和世界的和平。在1950年到1953年期间，美国侵略者屡次企图从朝鲜、台湾和越南，把战火扩大到中国大陆。如果不是中国人民坚决进行抗美援朝的正义战争，同朝鲜人民一起把美国侵略者从鸭绿江边打回三八线，就不但不可能实现朝鲜的停战，而且也不可能遏制住美帝国主义在台湾海峡发动战争的阴谋。1958年，美国侵略者调集了大量的海空军到台湾海峡，对我国人民进行战争威胁，如果不是中国人民进行坚决斗争，也就不可能使美国侵略者有所顾虑而不敢轻举妄动。十年来的全部事实告诉我们，台湾海峡的紧张局势，完全是由美国一手造成的。只要美国侵略者撤出台湾，台湾海峡也就根本不会存在任何紧张局势。反之，十年来美国在台湾海峡一再企图挑起战争的阴谋，所以未能得逞，又正是因为中国人民坚持了一定要解放台湾和坚决进行了反对美国侵略者的正义斗争。
    中国人民在保持警惕、坚决进行反对美帝国主义侵略斗争的同时，始终不懈地致力于缓和国际紧张局势，争取用和平谈判来解决国际争端。就是在美国侵占我国领土台湾的情况下，我们至今还同美国保持着大使级的谈判。中国人民为和平所作的一贯的真诚努力，是全世界人民有目共睹的。但是，现在美帝国主义却颠倒黑白，反诬中国人民坚决要解放自己领土台湾的正义斗争为制造紧张局势，为好战；现代修正主义者，屈服于帝国主义的战争讹诈政策，竟然胡说中国人民的正义斗争是“刺激了帝国主义”。这实际上是要求中国人民放弃正义的斗争，以适应帝国主义的需要。而如果这样去做的结果，就必然是促使帝国主义更加疯狂地发动战争，就只能是断送和平。中国人民是决不会这样做的。我们既不会被吓倒，也决不会上当。为了实现祖国的统一，为了保卫世界的和平，我们一定要解放台湾，而且一定能解放台湾。
    台湾历来是中国的领土，在日本帝国主义侵占台湾的五十一年期间，台湾人民就从不曾停止过反抗日本强盗和争取重归祖国怀抱的斗争。在美帝国主义侵占台湾的十年来，台、澎、金、马同胞身受美国侵略军的蹂躏，身受美国政府制造“两个中国”，沦台湾为美国殖民地的阴谋的威胁，更日益认识到帝国主义乃是中国人民最凶恶的敌人。台、澎、金、马同胞越来越不能容忍美国侵略者继续在台湾耀武扬威了。三年前台湾爱国同胞反美怒火的爆发，就证明了这一点。艾森豪威尔最近的强盗旅行，正在激发起台、澎、金、马同胞更加高涨的反美爱国斗争。这个美国的强盗头子，一方面到台湾来加紧策划战争阴谋，一方面又公开推行其制造“两个中国”的阴谋。这一切不但是台、澎、金、马的爱国同胞所绝不能容忍的，就是一直跟着美国走的人，面对这种情况，也不能不对自己的前途慎重考虑。应当看到，美国侵略者把坏事做绝了，它引起了全世界人民的愤怒，它已经迅速地在走着下坡路，它的日子越来越不好过了。艾森豪威尔在这次远东之行中变成了老鼠过街，人人喊打。美帝国主义的寿命是不会很长了。靠美国侵略者是靠不得的，也是靠不住的。现在是一个很好的时机，一切有爱国心的中国人都应当团结起来，结成广泛的统一战线，向中国人民和世界人民的共同的敌人美国侵略者坚决斗争；把美国侵略者赶出台湾，实现祖国的统一！
    美国发动侵朝战争、武装侵占我国领土台湾的十年，是美国的侵略政策和战争政策在世界范围内到处失败的十年。美帝国主义在世界人民和中国人民面前横行霸道的时代已经一去不复返了。最近一个时期世界上发生了一系列振奋人心的事件：李承晚、曼德列斯、岸信介都已被人民赶下台来，美帝国主义已经陷身于“四面楚歌”之中。一切帝国主义和反动派总是自掘坟墓。他们愈是穷凶极恶，结果就愈加激发人民的革命意志。他们的侵略活动愈是扩大，套在他们脖子上的绞索就愈来愈多。他们的挑衅活动愈是疯狂，它交在人民手中的绞索就愈拉愈紧。美帝国主义继续坚持侵略、坚持自己制造绞索套自己脖子的政策，结果只能是：它被全世界人民宣判绞刑的日子就愈益临近。
    美帝国主义的日子，确实是一天比一天不好过了。但是，美帝国主义的侵略本性和战争政策，却决不会因此改变。现代修正主义者说什么只要消除对帝国主义的“不信任”，那么帝国主义就会放弃用战争的方式来追求自己的目的。这真是厚颜无耻、荒唐透顶！美帝国主义永远不会“放下屠刀”，这是它的阶级本性和腐朽制度所决定了的，并已为历史事实，特别是近十年来的事实所证明。从二十世纪开始到现在，美国先后换过九个总统，其中民主党三个、共和党六个，连赫脱在内一共换过十六个国务卿，几曾看到过美帝国主义放弃侵略政策？没有！美帝国主义的侵略政策不仅没改变，而且越来越露骨，我们绝不能幻想和平，上了帝国主义假和平真备战的当！
    福建前线军民深深知道帝国主义制度就是现代战争的根源，只要帝国主义存在，战争的威胁就一定不能消除。我们一刻也没有忘记，美帝国主义至今仍以武力侵占我国的领土台湾，美帝国主义最近在远东地区不断进行大规模军事演习，其中有些演习公然针对我国，艾森豪威尔“访问”台湾时竟肆无忌惮地叫嚣“保卫”金马。我们福建前线部队全体官兵一定要在党的领导下，在人民群众的支援下，加强戒备，加速我军建设，彻底粉碎美帝国主义任何挑衅和破坏活动，坚决为解放台澎金马，保卫祖国，保卫世界和平而奋斗。不达目的誓不罢休！
