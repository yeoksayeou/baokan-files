Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 1st: Some Japanese public opinion believes that the raging fire of the Japanese people's massive struggle against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and against the Kishi Nobusuke clique will further burn the U.S. imperialism.

    Yesterday, the Japan Broadcasting Corporation's radio station commented on Eisenhower's visit to Japan and the Japanese political situation, saying: The current situation is that the movement against Kishi Nobusuke has developed into an anti-American movement. The commentary revealed that the United States is worried that if an "unpleasant" incident occurs during Eisenhower's visit to Japan, it will damage Japan-U.S. "friendly" relations.

    The commentary also said that U.S. President Eisenhower seems to be very troubled by the current situation in Japan. The commentary pointed out that the Japanese people and opposition parties are opposing Eisenhower's visit to Japan. It is reported that Japanese police authorities, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, and the Imperial Household Agency officials responsible for Eisenhower's "security" have no confidence in preventing "unfortunate incidents." They are particularly afraid of the Japanese people demonstrating against Eisenhower on June 19. According to reports, the police from neighboring prefectures of Tokyo may all be mobilized, but it is still considered insufficient. Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials said that adding armored vehicles to the front and rear of the motorcade would not be elegant. Therefore, these relevant authorities secretly hope that Eisenhower can cleverly cancel his trip to Japan.

    The "Asahi Shimbun" reported that Japanese police authorities believe that the Japanese people's opposition to the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" should not be underestimated. If Eisenhower visits Japan, he will definitely encounter a sea of red flags.

    It is reported that the Japanese police also advised Eisenhower not to visit Japan, because opposition to the U.S. President's visit to Japan has become a widely adopted slogan like opposition to the "Security Treaty."

    反岸斗争和反美运动高涨
    美日反动派大为惊慌
    新华社1日讯　东京消息：日本一些舆论认为，日本人民声势浩大的反对新日美“安全条约”和反对岸信介集团的斗争的烈火将进一步烧到美帝国主义身上。
    日本广播协会电台昨天就艾森豪威尔访问日本和日本政局发表评论时说：现在的形势是反对岸信介的运动已经发展成为反美运动。评论透露，美国担心艾森豪威尔访问日本时万一发生“不愉快”的事情，将损害日美“友好”关系。
    评论还说，对目前日本形势感到很麻烦的，看来是美国总统艾森豪威尔。评论指出，日本人民和在野党派都在反对艾森豪威尔访问日本。据报道，负责艾森豪威尔“安全”的日本警察当局、外务省、法务省和宫内厅人士对能否防止“不幸事件”丝毫没有把握。他们特别害怕6月19日那天日本人民向艾森豪威尔示威。据报道，东京邻县的警察可能全部出动，但是还嫌不够。外务省人士说，汽车行列的首尾都加上装甲车又不大雅观。因此，这些有关当局都暗中希望艾森豪威尔能机智地取消他的日本之行。
    “朝日新闻”报道，日本警察当局认为，不应当低估日本人民反对新日美“安全条约”的情绪。如果艾森豪威尔访日，肯定会遇到一片红旗的海洋。
    据报道，日本警察也建议艾森豪威尔不要访问日本，因为反对美国总统访日已经像反对“安全条约”一样成为被广泛采用的口号。
