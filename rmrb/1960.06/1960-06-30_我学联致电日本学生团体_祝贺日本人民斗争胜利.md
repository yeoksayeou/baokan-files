    Xinhua News Agency, June 28th. The All-China Students' Federation today sent a telegram to the Tokyo Metropolitan Student Autonomy Association Liaison Council and the Japanese "Student Assembly for the Abolition of the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty' and Demanding Immediate Dissolution of the Diet," supporting their just struggle against U.S. imperialism and its agents in Japan.
    In the telegram, the All-China Students' Federation warmly congratulated the Japanese people on their new victory in the patriotic and just struggle against the U.S.—the successful thwarting of the U.S. imperialist chieftain Eisenhower's plot to "visit" Japan, and the forcing of the traitor Kishi Nobusuke to shamefully announce his resignation. The telegram said that the new victory of the Japanese people once again proves that the power of the people is incomparably strong, and that the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries are paper tigers. The Japanese people and students, tempered by struggle, need only to make persistent efforts, advance on the crest of victory, strengthen unity, and persist in struggle, and the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries can be completely defeated.
    The telegram said: "Chinese students firmly support your struggle. The great Japanese nation will never endure foreign rule for long. U.S. imperialism must be driven out of Japan by the Japanese people. The people and young students of China and Japan must unite more closely to overthrow our common enemy, U.S. imperialism."

    我学联致电日本学生团体
    祝贺日本人民斗争胜利
    新华社28日讯　中华全国学生联合会今天致电日本东京都学生自治会联络会议、日本“废除日美“安全条约”和要求立即解散国会学生大会”，支持他们反对美帝国主义及其在日本的代理人的正义斗争。
    全国学联在电报中热烈祝贺日本人民反美爱国正义斗争的新胜利——成功地粉碎了美帝国主义头子艾森豪威尔“访问”日本的阴谋计划，迫使岸信介卖国贼不得不可耻地宣布下台。电报说，日本人民的新胜利再一次证明人民的力量是强大无比的，美日反动派都是纸老虎。经过斗争锻炼的日本人民和学生只要再接再厉，乘胜前进，加强团结，坚持斗争，美日反动派是完全能够被击败的。
    电报说：“中国学生坚决支持你们的斗争。伟大的日本民族决不会长期忍受外国的统治。美帝国主义一定要被日本人民赶出日本。中日两国人民和青年学生更紧密地团结起来，打倒共同敌人美帝国主义。”
