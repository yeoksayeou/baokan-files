Yesterday, with the full support of people from all walks of life, 5.6 million Japanese workers, through resolute and unified action, smashed the sabotage and suppression of the Kishi Nobusuke government and held the largest strike since the war. This general strike demonstrated the powerful strength of the increasingly conscious Japanese working class, and also demonstrated the Japanese people's high-spirited fighting will to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, demand the dissolution of the Diet, abolish the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, and oppose Eisenhower's visit to Japan. As Kenji Miyamoto, General Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, pointed out, all the Japanese people have stood up, not only the workers, but also university professors and students. This event marks this struggle as a patriotic and just struggle.
    At 4:00 a.m. on June 4, the action of the national railway workers, the main force of this general strike, began. Trains on all lines and streetcars in Tokyo Station, known as the gateway to Japan, were completely suspended from the first train. Trains at stations in Osaka, Nagoya, Okayama, Shizuoka, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Sapporo belonging to the National Railway Workers' Union were also suspended on time. Traffic in various places was completely paralyzed. At the same time, bus workers in Kyoto and sailors in Yokohama Port, as well as telecommunications, postal, steel, coal, hardware, shipbuilding, shipping, chemical, printing, banking and other workers belonging to the 57 industrial unions of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan and the 19 industrial unions of the Federation of Independent Unions, joined the battle, setting off a storm of general strikes. 30,000 stores across Japan held a market strike in enthusiastic support of the general strike. Civil servants in government departments and teachers in various places also held workplace meetings to support their heroic worker brothers with practical actions. People from all walks of life in Japan poured into the streets, distributing leaflets, collecting signatures, and carrying out propaganda and agitation, acting in unison with the workers on general strike in various ways. 20,000 students in Tokyo, as well as many actors, painters, and well-known figures in the cultural circles, guarded the main stations, preventing the police authorities from sabotage and suppression, encouraging the workers' morale, and staying up all night. Leaders of the Japanese Socialist Party and the Communist Party and members of the Diet from both parties personally went to various gathering places in Tokyo to boost morale, and workers and students sang progressive songs to inspire the masses. Everywhere erupted the passionate emotions of the broad masses of the Japanese people fighting to save the national crisis, and everywhere could be heard people's angry roars against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. The victorious general strike of 5.6 million Japanese workers with the support of the people across the country not only demonstrated the consciousness, organization, and unity of the Japanese working class, but also marked the broad united front formed by the Japanese people of all strata to oppose the Kishi Nobusuke traitorous government and the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. Without the support and sympathy of the broad masses of the people, it would be impossible to carry out such a large-scale strike. As the joint statement of the National Railway Workers' Union and the National Railway Locomotive Workers' Union of Japan said: "This general strike is evidence that the people demand the resignation of the entire Kishi cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet." This is not only a serious warning to the Kishi Nobusuke clique of reactionary elements, but also a serious warning to the United States' decision to approve the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty quickly in advance and Eisenhower's "visit" to Japan.
    In order to prevent this political general strike, the Kishi Nobusuke group had taken all kinds of despicable and shameless means. It not only issued administrative orders to threaten and intimidate, but also instructed the police to suppress and sabotage, and even kidnapped train drivers, attempting to force them to drive. However, with the people united as one, all of Kishi Nobusuke's conspiracies were declared bankrupt in the face of the united Japanese people! The great victory of the general strike of 5.6 million Japanese workers proved that when the workers' strike is closely combined with the struggles of the people of all strata, it forms an unparalleled powerful force. Iwai Akira, Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, which has 3.6 million members, announced yesterday that "Sohyo" will further develop effective unified action and continue the struggle, and will never give up until Kishi Nobusuke steps down, the Diet is dissolved, and the ratification of the "Security Treaty" is prevented!
    We cannot help but be deeply moved by the indomitable spirit and heroism shown by the Japanese working class in the struggle of the general strike. The Chinese people extend their highest respect to the heroic Japanese worker brothers and congratulate them on the great victory of the general strike. The struggle of the Japanese working class and the broad masses of the people against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty is the common struggle of the Chinese and Japanese people and the people of Asia. The Chinese people firmly support the anti-U.S. patriotic struggle of the Japanese workers and people of all strata. We firmly believe that the Japanese working class and the broad masses of the people, tempered by this general strike, will, as long as they persist in unity, persist in the anti-U.S. patriotic united front, and persist in the struggle, eventually defeat any counterattack by the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary clique and achieve final victory!

    对美日反动派的当头棒喝
    昨天，日本五百六十万工人在各阶层人民全力支持下，以坚决一致的行动，粉碎岸信介政府的破坏和镇压，举行了战后最大规模的罢工。这次总罢工，显示出日益觉悟起来的日本工人阶级的强大威力，也显示了日本人民打倒岸信介内阁、要求解散国会、废除日美军事同盟条约和反对艾森豪威尔访问日本的昂扬斗争意志。正如日本共产党总书记宫本显治指出的，全体日本人民站起来了，不仅工人，而且大学教授和学生都站起来了。这件事情标志这个斗争是爱国正义斗争。
    6月4日凌晨4时，这次总罢工的主力国营铁道工人的行动开始了。被称为日本大门的东京车站的各线路的火车和市内电车从第一班车起全部停驶。属于国营铁道工会的大阪、名古屋、冈山、静冈、广岛、长崎和扎幌各车站的火车也一律准时停驶。各地交通完全陷于瘫痪状态。与此同时，京都的公共汽车工人和横滨港的船员，属于日本工会总评议会系统的五十七个产业工会和中立工会联合会的十九个产业工会的各地电信、邮政、钢铁、煤炭、五金、造船、海运、化学、印刷、银行等职工纷纷投入战斗，兴起了总罢工的风暴。日本全国三万家商店举行罢市，热烈支持总罢工。政府各部门的公务人员和各地教职员也召开工作场所大会，以实际行动声援英勇的工人弟兄。日本各阶层人民涌向街头，散发传单、征集签名、进行宣传鼓动，用各种方式同举行总罢工的工人们一致行动。东京两万名学生以及许多演员、画家和文化界著名人士，守备在各个主要车站，阻止警察当局的破坏和镇压，鼓励工人斗志，通宵达旦。日本社会党、共产党的领导人和两党的国会议员，亲自到东京各个集会场所鼓舞士气，工人和学生高唱进步歌曲激励群众。到处迸发出广大日本人民为挽救民族危机而斗争的激昂情绪，到处可以听到人们坚决反对日美军事同盟条约的怒吼。日本五百六十万工人在全国人民支持下胜利举行的总罢工，不仅表现出日本工人阶级的觉悟性、组织性和团结起来的威力，并且标志日本各阶层人民为了反对岸信介卖国政府、反对日美军事同盟条约，已经结成了广泛的统一战线。如果没有广大人民的支持和同情，要进行这样大规模的罢工，是不可能的。有如日本国营铁道工会和国营铁道机车工会的联合声明所说的：“这次总罢工是国民要求岸内阁全体辞职和解散国会的证据。”这不只是对岸信介一小撮反动分子的严重警告，并且也是对于美国决定提前迅速批准日美军事同盟条约以及艾森豪威尔“访问”日本的严重警告。
    为了阻止这次政治性的总罢工，岸信介集团曾采取了一切卑鄙无耻的手段。它不仅发布行政命令进行威胁和恫吓，还指使警察镇压、破坏，甚至绑架火车司机，企图迫使他们开车。然而，众志成城，岸信介的一切阴谋，在团结起来的日本人民面前都宣告破产了！日本五百六十万工人总罢工的大胜利，证明了当工人的罢工同各阶层人民的斗争紧密地结合起来以后，就形成了无比强大的力量。拥有三百六十万会员的日本工会总评议会事务局长岩井章昨天宣布，“总评”将进一步发展有效的统一行动，继续斗争，不使岸信介下台、国会解散、阻止批准“安全条约”，绝不罢休！
    日本工人阶级在总罢工的斗争中所表现出来的那种不屈不挠的坚毅精神和英雄气概，不能不使我们深受感动。中国人民谨向英勇的日本工人弟兄致以崇高的敬意，并且祝贺他们总罢工的重大胜利。日本工人阶级和广大人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争，是中日两国人民、亚洲人民的共同斗争。中国人民坚决支持日本工人和各阶层人民的反美爱国斗争。我们坚信，经过这一次总罢工锻炼的日本工人阶级和广大人民群众，只要坚持团结，坚持反美爱国统一战线，坚持斗争，终将击败岸信介反动集团的任何反扑，取得最后胜利！
