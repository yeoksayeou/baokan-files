    Strive to Overfulfill the Higher Education Enrollment Task
    Yesterday, the Ministry of Education issued the regulations for the 1960 higher education entrance examinations. This year's higher education enrollment work will begin during the summer vacation.
    Since the issuance of the instructions on education work by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council in 1958, China's higher education has developed greatly. The number of students enrolled in higher education institutions has reached 810,000, and together with the 300,000 students in part-time higher education institutions, the target of 850,000 students in higher education institutions stipulated in the Second Five-Year Plan has been exceeded. In order to adapt to the needs of the continued leap forward in China's industrial and agricultural production and other construction undertakings, this year's full-time higher education institutions plan to enroll 280,000 students, an increase of 30,000 compared to last year's plan. The increase in the number of enrollments indicates that China's higher education is developing rapidly, which is a great thing. However, on the other hand, the number of high school graduates this year does not meet the needs of higher education enrollment, and the number of candidates from other aspects is also relatively small. This is a problem in the midst of progress, a problem that is bound to arise from the rapid development of higher education, and it can be completely solved with serious effort. We believe that under the leadership of the Party committees at all levels, all relevant parties will give play to their enthusiasm, fully tap potential, expand student sources, and ensure that this year's higher education enrollment task will be completed or overfulfilled.
    Expanding student sources should be approached from many directions. First, high school graduates are the main source of higher education enrollment. Therefore, all localities should correctly understand the country's current needs, mobilize high school graduates to actively apply for higher education institutions, and not divert them to other uses. After the higher education enrollment task is completed, if there is still a surplus, the localities can make other arrangements. Second, it is necessary to select and send a portion of employees, cadres, and commune members from factories, mines, enterprises, farms, state organs, and people's communes who meet the conditions to apply for higher education institutions. This is an important aspect of expanding student sources. In recent years, China's on-the-job employee education has developed greatly, and the scientific and cultural level of employees has greatly improved. The number of people who meet the conditions for applying to higher education institutions is increasing day by day. Absorbing on-the-job employees and cadres into higher education institutions is not only an important measure to expand student sources, but also has great political significance for improving the scientific and cultural level of employees and cadres, improving the quality of new higher education students, improving the quality of national talent cultivation, promoting technological revolution and cultural revolution, and accelerating China's socialist construction. After carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution movements, factories and mines in various localities have increased labor productivity and saved labor, and therefore it is also possible to withdraw a portion of people to leave production for study. We hope that the relevant departments of the central and local governments and the factories, mines, and enterprises can deeply understand the great significance of this measure of selecting and sending employees and cadres to schools, proceed from the long-term interests and the overall perspective, actively tap potential, overcome temporary difficulties, and be determined to select and send a group of excellent young employees and cadres to higher education institutions to study. For other sources of candidates, efforts should also be made to open them up as much as possible. For example, transferring a portion of outstanding graduates from secondary vocational schools to apply, mobilizing demobilized and transferred soldiers and other educated youth to apply, and so on. In short, all localities and departments should pay special attention to this work, study it carefully, strengthen leadership, and do everything possible to expand student sources, striving to have more people apply for higher education institutions this year.
    Higher education enrollment is a serious political task. The quality of new students directly affects the quality of talent cultivation in higher education institutions. Therefore, what kind of people to select, what standards to use to select, and who should do the selecting are the key issues in enrollment work. Enrollment work, like other aspects of education work, must strengthen the Party's leadership and adhere to putting politics in command; in selecting students, we must first pay attention to the political conditions of the students, and on the premise of ensuring political quality, combine the academic and health conditions of the candidates to select the best; we must resolutely implement the class line, give priority to enrolling worker-peasant students, and rapidly increase the proportion of worker-peasant students in higher education institutions. In particular, key schools should pay special attention to implementing these principles. Only in this way can we do a good job in the first step of higher education cadre training, and only then is it possible for higher education institutions to cultivate a scientific and technological cadre contingent and a theoretical cadre contingent of Marxism-Leninism that is both red and expert in a more, faster, better, and more economical way for the country.
    According to the "walking on two legs" policy of combining popularization and improvement, higher education enrollment should also pay attention to implementing the principle of separately guaranteeing the quality of new students according to the situation of the schools. According to the principle of the entire country as a chess game, priority should be given to guaranteeing the quality of new students in key schools, especially national key schools. This is one of the prerequisites for running key schools well. In this regard, all localities did a better job last year, and the quality of new students in key schools has improved significantly compared to the past. We hope that all localities can proceed from the overall situation in future higher education enrollment work, continue to implement these principles, and take effective measures to enable key schools, especially national key schools, to enroll the best quality students. It should be understood that concentrating major efforts on running a number of key schools well and improving the quality of cadre training in these schools has great significance for the development of China's economic construction and scientific and cultural undertakings. At the same time, key schools taking the lead can also drive other schools forward and promote the development of the entire education undertaking. Of course, saying that priority should be given to guaranteeing key schools does not mean that other schools should not be taken care of. On the premise of giving priority to guaranteeing key schools, other schools should also be given appropriate consideration. Higher education enrollment work should be under the unified leadership of the local Party committees, with overall planning and separate guarantees, giving priority to guaranteeing key schools and also giving appropriate consideration to general schools.
    In order to adapt to the new situation of the rapid development of higher education, the organization of this year's enrollment work must also be changed and further improved accordingly. The principle of combining unified leadership and decentralized handling should be further implemented. In addition to some necessary standards and methods that need to be unified nationally, the enrollment work of various types of higher education institutions should be organized by the provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, strengthening the leadership of the local Party committees over this work and handling the enrollment work in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. In enrollment work, it is also necessary to continuously improve working methods, improve work efficiency, and complete the increasingly large higher education enrollment task with less manpower and shorter time.

### 力争超额完成高等学校招生任务

    力争超额完成高等学校招生任务
    昨天，教育部发布了1960年高等学校招考新生的规定。今年暑假的高等学校招生工作就要开始办理了。
    自从1958年中共中央和国务院发出关于教育工作的指示以来，我国的高等教育事业有了巨大的发展。高等学校在校学生已达到八十一万人，连同业余高等学校三十万人，已经超额完成了第二个五年计划中规定的高等学校学生八十五万人的指标。为了适应我国工农业生产及其他各项建设事业继续跃进形势的需要，今年全日制高等学校计划招生二十八万人，比去年的计划增加了三万人。招生人数的增长，说明了我国的高等教育事业正在飞速发展，这是一件大好事。但是另一方面，今年高中毕业生的人数满足不了高等学校招生的需要，其他方面的考生人数也较少。这是前进当中的问题，是高等教育事业飞速发展所必然产生的问题，只要经过认真的努力，是完全可以解决的。我们相信，在各级党委的领导下，各有关方面发挥积极性，充分挖掘潜力，扩大学生来源，今年的高等学校招生任务一定能够完成或超额完成。
    扩大学生来源应当从多方面想办法。首先，高中毕业生是高等学校招生的主要来源，因此，各地应当正确地认识国家当前的需要，动员高中毕业生踊跃报考高等学校，不要抽作他用，等到完成高等学校招生任务以后，如果还有余额，地方再作其他安排。其次，必须从厂矿企业、农场、国家机关和人民公社选送一部分条件适合的职工、干部和公社社员报考高等学校。这是扩大学生来源的一个重要方面。几年来，我国职工业余教育有了很大的发展，职工的科学文化水平有很大的提高。合乎报考高等学校的条件的人数日益增多。吸收在职职工和干部进入高等学校学习，这不仅是扩大学生来源的一条重要措施，而且对于提高职工和干部的科学文化水平，提高高等学校新生的质量，提高国家培养建设人才的质量，促进技术革命和文化革命，加速我国社会主义建设，也都具有重大的政治意义。各地厂矿在开展技术革新和技术革命运动以后，提高了劳动生产率，节省了劳动力，因而也有可能抽出一部分人来脱离生产学习。我们希望中央和地方各有关部门和各厂矿企业，能够深刻理解选送职工和干部入学这一措施的重大意义，从长远利益和全局观点出发，积极挖掘潜力，克服暂时困难，下决心选送一批优秀的青年职工和干部进入高等学校学习。对于其他方面的考生来源，也应当尽量开辟。例如抽调一部分条件优秀的中等专业学校毕业生报考，动员复员、转业军人及其他知识青年报考，等等。总之，各地、各部门应当特别重视这项工作，认真研究，加强领导，千方百计地扩大学生来源，争取今年能够有更多的人报考高等学校。
    高等学校招生工作，是一件严肃的政治性工作。新生的质量，直接影响着高等学校培养建设人才的质量。因此，挑选什么样的人，以什么标准来挑选，由谁来挑选，这是招生工作中的关键问题。招生工作和教育工作的其他方面一样，必须加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅；挑选学生，必须首先注意学生的政治条件，在保证政治质量的前提下，结合考生的学业、健康条件，择优录取；必须坚决贯彻阶级路线，优先录取工农学生，使高等学校学生中工农成份学生的比重迅速增长。尤其是重点学校，更要特别注意贯彻这些原则。只有这样，才能作好高等学校培养干部的第一步工作，才有可能使高等学校多快好省地为国家培养又红又专的科学技术干部队伍和马克思列宁主义的理论干部队伍。
    根据普及与提高相结合的“两条腿走路”的方针，高等学校招生，还应当注意根据学校的情况，贯彻分别保证新生质量的原则。要根据全国一盘棋的原则，优先保证重点学校，特别是全国重点学校的新生质量。这是办好重点学校的先决条件之一。在这方面，去年各地做得都比较好，重点学校的新生质量比以往有显著提高。我们希望各地在今后的高等学校招生工作中，能够从全局出发，继续贯彻这些原则，采取有效措施，使重点学校、特别是全国重点学校能够招收到质量最好的学生。要知道，集中主要力量办好一批重点学校，提高这些学校培养干部的质量，对我国经济建设以及科学文化事业的发展都有着重大的意义。同时，重点学校先走一步，又可以带动其他学校前进，促进整个教育事业的发展。当然，说优先保证重点学校，并不是说其他学校就不要照顾，在优先保证重点学校的前提下，对其他学校也要适当照顾。高等学校招生工作，应当在地方党委的统一领导下，统筹安排，分别保证，既要优先保证重点，也要适当照顾一般。
    为了适应高等教育事业迅速发展的新形势，今年招生的组织工作也必须相应地改变和进一步提高。应当进一步贯彻统一领导与分散办理相结合的原则，除了一些必要的标准、办法需要全国统一规定以外，各类高等学校的招生工作，都应当由各省、市、自治区来组织进行，加强地方党委对这一工作的领导，多快好省地办理招生工作。在招生工作中还必须不断地改进工作方法，提高工作效率，用较少的人力和较短的时间来完成越来越大的高等学校招生任务。
