Emphasize national style, perform well

I would like to report to the conference on the creation of the group calisthenics I prepared for the first National Games. Shortly after arriving in Beijing, the Party assigned me to be in charge of this creation team. This creation team was conducted under the direct leadership of the Beijing Municipal Sports Commission. Vice Premier He Long personally convened a meeting on the creation of group calisthenics, instructing us: "When doing a ten-thousand-person group calisthenics performance, we must emphasize national style and perform well." Seeing the Party's attention and care, and hearing Vice Premier He Long's instructions, I was both excited and afraid. Excited that the Party had entrusted us with such a glorious task, giving us the opportunity to contribute to the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China; afraid that creating large-scale group calisthenics was a first in our country's history, and we lacked experience and practice, and there was little reference material.

Under the wise leadership of the Party, after about a year, and with the strong support of all parties, all comrades in the group worked day and night to actively create "National Celebration," the first large-scale gymnastics involving nearly ten thousand people in the history of our country, and successfully completed the task assigned to us by the Party and the people of the motherland.

The entire gymnastics is composed of five sections: "Happy Children," "Blossoms of Youth," "Heroes Competing in Martial Arts," "Healthy and Beautiful Youth," and "Long Live the Motherland." The performance of the "National Celebration" group calisthenics greatly inspired and encouraged the people of our country. Many reporters, poets, and painters, after seeing it, wrote enthusiastic articles and poems of praise, and drew beautiful pictures; some dancers even wanted to put it on the stage. The performance of "National Celebration" group calisthenics also received enthusiastic praise from many foreign dignitaries. The Chairman of the Romanian General Trade Union said: "China's group calisthenics has a very high level of artistry and skill." The Vice Chairman of the Bulgarian Sports Federation said excitedly: "Each program of China's group calisthenics has political content, not only are the movements neat and beautiful, but the naming is also very meaningful. Organizing such a large-scale mass gymnastics performance is quite difficult, but you have organized it very well." Members of the French delegation said: "Such a large-scale performance cannot be organized in France at all." Some foreign old ladies and young women were moved to tears while watching the performance. Some foreign friends were very surprised and said: "The Chinese are really amazing!"

Reflect the spiritual outlook of the great era and the great people

In short, under the leadership of the Party, the creation and performance of the ten-thousand-person group calisthenics have achieved certain successes.

I have the following important situations and experiences in participating in this group calisthenics creation process.

When I accepted this work, I realized that this was a political task assigned to me by the Party. We must create group calisthenics that are grand in scale, diverse in form, prominent in national style, able to reflect the magnificent picture of our country's socialist construction, reflect the spiritual outlook of the Chinese people in this great era, and have an international level, so that it can have a major political impact at home and abroad and win glory for the motherland.

We had never learned or done the creation of large-scale group calisthenics. After looking at some materials and having a preliminary impression of large-scale group calisthenics, we began to try to create a few sets of exercises. However, most of these exercises were considered purely from the use of equipment or from personal preferences, the theme was not clear, it was not in line with the situation of the Great Leap Forward across the country, and it could not reflect the great spiritual outlook of the Chinese people. After the enlightenment and guidance of the Party leadership, I revisited Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and other articles, and found the direction from Chairman Mao's works. I thought: the exercises we create should not only look at their artistic level, but more importantly, look at their political level. If we want to create the exercises well, we should make them rich in strong ideology. Each part of the group calisthenics must first have a clear theme, but where can the theme be found? At this time, victories on various fronts followed one after another, and miracles followed miracles, which fully demonstrated the Party's correct leadership, so we determined that we must sing praises of the beloved Party and sing praises of the great motherland. This gave me the motivation to create "Blossoms of Youth" and also constituted the theme of "Blossoms of Youth." I thought that the motherland should be compared to a beautiful garden, and the Party's various undertakings are all bright and beautiful flowers, and each flower dances in one direction under a unified melody, symbolizing that all undertakings are advancing towards socialism and communism under the unified leadership of the Party. According to the requirements of this theme, the "Blossoms of Youth" exercise was composed of three parts: "Red Flowers Facing the Sun," "Butterflies and Gardens," and "Flourishing."

In order to reflect the drive of the people across the country and the characteristics of the era, after the enlightenment and instructions of the leadership, we found the theme of "Long Live the Motherland." Using the scenery of agricultural bumper harvests, golden wheat waves rolling everywhere, to set off the diligence and joy of the peasants, to sing praises of the superiority of the people's communes; using small blast furnaces all over the place to set off the soaring enthusiasm of the working class, to show the magnificent feat of the people's mass steelmaking. In this way, according to Chairman Mao's instructions on the criteria for measuring art—politics first, art second—we boldly gave the group calisthenics a clear theme that reflected the times and the people's lives, breaking through the routine of simple movement combinations in general group calisthenics, giving it a strong ideology; and expressing it with revolutionary romanticism. This gave the group calisthenics a new life and found a correct path for the development of group calisthenics.

With a clear theme, it must also be expressed in a very good artistic form in order to conform to Chairman Mao's instructions on "the unity of politics and art, and the unity of content and form." I knew that we could not stick to foreign and general gymnastics forms, because it was inconsistent with the content, and simple gymnastics forms could not express its ideological content. This could only be achieved by liberating our minds and creating boldly.

In the "Blossoms of Youth" exercise, the reason why a group of butterflies were used to fly in the garden, and the flowers and butterflies echoed each other, forming a lively and energetic scene to symbolize the happy motherland and the joyous youth, was inspired by the traditional Chinese painting "Ode to Peace."

In the "Long Live the Motherland" exercise, a large area of wheat waves and the scene of a bumper harvest reflected the superiority of the people's communes. However, in the initial creation, only the expression of wheat fields and wheat waves was considered, which led to the problem of seeing things but not people. When I thought that traditional Chinese paintings often have the dynamics of people in landscapes with mountains and rivers, I considered that the activities of peasants should be expressed in the wheat fields, so I absorbed the movements of the folk dance "Carrying Loads," and added rows of peasants coming and going in the wheat fields, expressing the peasants' enthusiastic labor and joy for the harvest. In this way, not only did it not destroy the basic appearance of the group calisthenics, but it also enriched its content, highlighted the national style, improved the artistic quality, and more powerfully expressed the theme.

In order to highlight the national characteristics, we moved the traditional Chinese martial arts into the gymnastics. This was a bold attempt. Martial arts are not suitable for collective performance by a large number of people. Some people have tried it without success, because it is not easy to be neat and consistent, the movements are complex, and the rhythm is not as fixed as gymnastics. At the beginning, we asked comrades from the martial arts team to compile it. After several revisions and diligent study and hard practice, we mastered the basic movements of martial arts, studied its rules, found its typical movements, removed some complex and difficult-to-unify small movements, and fixed its rhythm. This made it suitable for collective performance. In order to make it easier for female comrades to master, martial arts and classical dance were combined to make it more beautiful and coordinated. This prominently showed the heroic spirit and boldness of our Chinese nation, inherited the essence of martial arts, and explored a direction for the application of national-style martial arts in large-scale group calisthenics performances.

In the movements of the group calisthenics, we absorbed some of the better things from foreign countries, created some new movements, and transformed them into Chinese things. For example, the "Healthy and Beautiful Youth" exercise mainly performs acrobatic skills. In order to make it a performance with national characteristics, we absorbed the superb skills in the original acrobatic movements, and also absorbed the lifting movements of ballet and folk dance, and the typical movements of Chinese classical dance, and integrated them into a complete acrobatic performance with Chinese style. These movements appear in the exercise, not only have the open characteristics of foreign movements, but also have the implicit beauty of Chinese classical movements, are rich in inner emotions and the lively character of folk dance, and enrich the movements of gymnastics. In the entire group calisthenics, we implemented the unified law of hand, eye, body, and footwork, highlighted the national characteristics, and improved the artistic level.

Learn humbly, study hard, learn and create at the same time

In order to continuously improve the quality of the exercise and complete the political task assigned to us by the Party, we studied the Party's policies and current affairs throughout the entire creation process, so that we could constantly recognize the revolutionary situation. In terms of professional work, we learned and created at the same time, learning everywhere and learning humbly. In addition to watching various literary and artistic performances, we also went to acrobatic troupes, song and dance troupes, and martial arts teams to ask for advice; we looked at magazines, street murals, and even observed Beijing's new and old buildings; and so on. These studies and observations have continuously given us rich nourishment. In this process, we spent a lot of time practicing martial arts and learning to play with meteors, often sweating all over. But we knew that only through hard study could we create the exercise well.

Learning from all aspects enlightened our thinking. For example, the last scene of "Blossoms of Youth" is a passionate song of praise for the motherland and the Party, for peace and happiness, and it should be like a hymn. The first scheme was created and failed after experimentation; the form of expression was generalized, neither beautiful nor moving. We pondered and thought for a long time but could not find a suitable form, but we were inspired by the chorus at a concert. I felt that the last scene of this exercise should be like a chorus, and the form of expression should have several groups of different movements, forming a coordinated whole under the same rhythm; but we were also troubled by the fact that the movements could not break the mold. Another time, at a dance performance, I saw the "Sunflower Dance," in which a sunflower turns to the sun, which was both meaningful and particularly beautiful. I was very happy and decided to move it from the stage to the sports field, and after appropriate processing, make it more beautiful. In this way, the artistic quality of the final scene of "Blossoms of Youth" was even higher, the meaning was richer, and the theme was more clearly highlighted, with a unique national form. Every time it was performed, it won warm applause from the audience.

At the beginning of creating the peasant exercise, due to insufficient clarity of thought, the design scheme was overthrown several times. At this time, I saw the murals created by the masses in the streets, such as "Playing Hide-and-Seek Under the Chinese Cabbage" and "Children Riding Fat Pigs," and the spirit of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism deeply inspired me. I also saw many "satellite" agricultural products in the agricultural exhibition hall, and learned that agricultural production was a large-scale bumper harvest, so I seized this key and decided to use agricultural bumper harvests to sing praises of the people's communes. I also studied the wheat wave movements of the Soviet Union and Nanjing group calisthenics, and adopted large-scale formation changes in the form of expression to give it a majestic momentum. In this way, we not only learned the techniques to reflect the theme and the best forms of expression, but also learned how to embody the principles of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism in gymnastics.

The process of creating group calisthenics for more than a year was also a process of the Party leading us to constantly carry out two ideological struggles. We waged struggles against individualism, the pursuit of the limelight, failure to attach importance to the political and ideological nature of the exercise, the pursuit of so-called formal beauty, and disbelief in the masses and failure to follow the mass line, and other bourgeois ideologies. At the beginning of the work, we were divided into several groups to create separately, which led to the phenomenon of each group taking care of its own affairs. Regardless of whether it was appropriate, we tried our best to incorporate good formations and forms of expression into our own exercises, resulting in the repetition of forms of expression in several exercises, which could not make the exercises diversified and highlight the characteristics of each exercise. It also caused disunity and affected the smooth progress of the creation. Because we relied on the Party and received the Party's education, the comrades proceeded from the overall situation, cared about the work of the collective, changed the past situation of only taking care of themselves, and embarked on the road of truly collective creation.

Following the mass line can achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results

After the exercise was created, there were only twenty-odd days for rehearsal, and the performers were more than 10,000 people from more than 40 primary and secondary schools in Beijing. Under such a tight schedule and heavy task, the question of how to organize the rehearsal arose again. Some comrades were afraid that others would rehearse the exercise incorrectly and wanted to rehearse it themselves; some comrades could not humbly listen to the opinions of the teachers in the schools where the rehearsal took place. We organized a discussion, unified our thinking, and, according to the Party's instructions, insisted on following the mass line in the rehearsal and delegated the exercise to each school to coach. This mobilized the enthusiasm of the teachers in each school, and they also put forward many useful suggestions for revision during the coaching. As a result, the group calisthenics was successfully rehearsed quickly, well, and economically.

Through the entire process of group calisthenics creation and rehearsal, we have further realized that only by relying on the leadership of the Party, arming ourselves with proletarian ideology, and constantly criticizing bourgeois ideology can the work continue to move forward.

The reason why all the comrades in our creation team were able to achieve such results after more than a year is first of all due to the leadership of the Party and the result of the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. Because only with the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao could we find the correct direction, find the way to create, and generate wisdom and strength. Secondly, it is also due to the vigorous cooperation of relevant units and performing schools in Beijing and across the country; it is also due to the encouragement of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes to us; and it is also due to the collective wisdom of all the comrades in the group. I myself have only done a little bit of what I should have done in the collective work. I should say that the biggest gain in this process is that I have received profound education in many aspects. I deeply appreciate that the Party has given me such a good opportunity to be educated.

Group calisthenics is an indispensable item in large-scale sports meets, and it is a means of reviewing the level of mass sports in the country. In the future, I will continue to study group calisthenics and strive to popularize and improve group calisthenics. I want to create newer and more beautiful group calisthenics. I want to win greater glory for the motherland, for the Party, and for Chairman Mao in this project.

    为祖国体育事业争光
    长春体育学院讲师　杨瑞雪
    要突出民族风格，要演得好
    我向大会汇报一下我参加第一届全运会准备的团体操的创编工作；到北京不久党让我负责这个创编组的工作。这个创编组是在北京市体委直接领导下进行的。贺龙副总理亲自召开团体操创编工作会议，指示我们说：“搞万人团体操表演，要突出民族风格，要演得好。”看到党这样重视和关怀，听了贺龙副总理的指示，我又是激动，又是害怕。激动的是党把这么光荣的任务交给了我们，使我们有机会为庆祝建国十周年贡献一份力量；害怕的是创编大型团体操，在我国历史上还是第一次，我们缺乏经验与实践，而且参考资料又很少。
    在党的英明领导下，经过一年左右的时间，经过各方面大力支援，全组同志日以继夜地积极工作，终于创编出总名为“全民同庆”的我国有史以来第一个将近万人的大型体操，胜利地完成了党和祖国人民交给我们的任务。
    全操是由“幸福儿童”、“青春的花朵”、“群英比武”、“健美青春”、“祖国万岁”等五个操组成的。“全民同庆”团体操的演出，大大地振奋和鼓舞了我国人民，许多记者、诗人和画家看了后，都写下了热情洋溢的赞美文章和诗篇，画下了美丽的画面；有的舞蹈家还想把它搬上舞台。“全民同庆”团体操的演出，也得到了许多外国贵宾的热情赞赏。罗马尼亚全总主席说：“中国的团体操，艺术水平和技巧水平都很高超。”保加利亚体育联合会副主席兴奋地说：“中国的团体操每个节目都具有政治内容，不但动作整齐优美，而且命名很有意义。组织那样大规模的群众性体操表演是相当困难的，但是你们组织得很好。”法国代表团团员说：“这样大型的表演在法国是根本组织不起来的。”有的外国老太太和青年妇女，一边看表演一边感动的流下了眼泪。有的外国朋友非常惊奇地说：“中国人真了不起！”
    反映伟大的时代伟大的人民的精神面貌
    总之，万人团体操在党的领导下无论是创编或表演都获得了一定的成就。
    我在参加这次创编团体操过程中有以下一些重要的情况和体会。
    当我接受这个工作时，认识到这是党交给自己的一项政治任务。我们一定要编出规模宏大、形式多样、民族风格突出、能反映我国社会主义建设的壮丽图景的、反映出这个伟大时代中我国人民的精神面貌的、有国际水平的团体操，要它在国内和国际上产生重大的政治影响，为祖国争光。
    创编大型团体操我们从没有学过也没有作过。看过一些资料后，对大型团体操有了一个初步印象，我们就开始试编出几个操来。但这些操多数是单纯从使用器械或从个人的爱好出发来考虑的，主题思想不明确，和全国大跃进的形势不相适应，不能体现出我国人民的伟大精神面貌。经过党领导的启发指导，我重温了毛主席的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”等文章，从毛主席著作中找到了方向。我想：我们编的操，不仅要看它的艺术水平，更重要的是要看它的政治水平，要想把操编好，应该使它富有强烈的思想性。团体操每个部分首先要有鲜明的主题，可是主题从哪里去找呢？这时，各个战线上胜利接着胜利，奇迹跟着奇迹，都充分说明了党的正确的领导，因此我们确定必须歌颂亲爱的党，歌颂伟大的祖国。这就使我产生了创编“青春花朵”的动机，也构成了“青春花朵”的主题思想。我想应该把祖国比作一个美丽的大花园，党的各项事业都是一朵朵鲜艳美丽的花朵，各个花朵都在一个统一的旋律下朝一个方向起舞，象征各项事业都是在党的统一领导下，向社会主义、共产主义前进。根据这样主题思想的要求，便把“青春花朵”这个操用“红花向太阳”、“蝴蝶与花园”、“欣欣向荣”三个部分组成。
    为了反映全国人民的干劲与时代的特征，经过领导的启发和指示，又找到了“祖国万岁”的主题。用农业大丰产，遍地黄金麦浪滚滚的景象，衬托着农民的勤劳和喜悦，来歌颂人民公社的优越；用遍地小高炉，衬托出工人阶级的冲天干劲，来表现出全民大炼钢铁的宏伟壮举。我们就这样根据毛主席的关于衡量艺术的标准——政治第一，艺术第二的指示，大胆地给予了团体操以鲜明的反映时代的、人民生活的主题，突破了一般团体操单纯动作组合的陈规，使它有强烈的思想性；并用革命的浪漫主义手法表现出来。这就给团体操以新的生命，为团体操的发展找到了一条正确的道路。
    有了鲜明的主题，还必须用很好的艺术形式表现出来，才能符合毛主席的“政治与艺术统一，内容与形式统一”的指示。我知道，是不能拘泥于外国的和一般的体操形式中，因为它与内容不一致，而且单纯的体操形式也不能表现出它的思想内容，这只有解放思想大胆的创作了。
    在“青春的花朵”一操中，所以采用了一群蝴蝶在花园里飞舞，让花朵与蝴蝶互相呼应，构成一个活泼有生气的情景，来象征幸福的祖国，欢乐的青春，这是由于看了国画“和平颂”得到的启发。
    在“祖国万岁”一操中，用大片的麦浪，丰收的情景反映了人民公社的优越。但在创编初只考虑麦田、麦浪的表现，产生了见物不见人的问题。当我想到国画中常常在有山有水的风景中，又衬托有人的动态时，就考虑在麦田中应该表现出农民的活动，于是就吸收了民间舞“担担子”的动作，加上一行行农民在麦田里来往穿梭，表现出农民热情的劳动和对丰收的喜悦。这样，不仅没有破坏团体操的基本面貌，而且更加丰富了它的内容，突出了民族风格，提高了艺术性，更有力地表现出主题思想。
    为了突出民族特点，我们把民族传统的武术搬到体操中来。这是一个大胆的尝试。武术不适于多数人集体表演，有些人试验过没成功，因为它不易整齐一致，动作复杂，节奏不像体操那样固定。开始时，请武术队同志编，经过几次修改和勤学苦练，掌握了武术的基本动作，研究了它的规律，找出了它的典型动作，去掉一些复杂及难以整齐的小动作，固定它的拍节。这样就适合于集体表演了。为了使女同志更易于掌握，又使武术和古典舞相结合，使它更加优美和协调。这样就突出地显示了我国民族的那种英雄气概和豪放性格，继承了武术的精华，为民族形式的武术在大型团体操表演中的运用摸索到了一个方向。
    在团体操的动作中，我们吸收了一些外国较好的东西，创造了一些新动作，并把它变成了中国的东西。比如“健美的青春”这个操，它主要是表演双人技巧动作。为了使它成为一个有民族特色的表演，我们吸收了原有技巧动作中的高超的技术，也吸收了芭蕾舞的和民间舞的托举动作，中国古典舞的典型动作，把它们融合在一起，成为具有中国风格的完整的双人技巧表演。这些动作在操中出现，不仅有外国动作的开朗的特点，而且有中国古典动作的含蓄的美，富于内在情感和民间舞的活泼的性格，丰富了体操的动作。在整个团体操中，我们贯彻了手、眼、身、步法统一规律，突出了民族特点，提高了艺术水平。虚心学，刻苦学，边学边作
    为了不断提高操的质量，完成党交给我们的政治任务，在整个创编过程中，我们学习了党的方针政策和时事，使自己不断的认清革命的形势；在业务上边作边学，处处学，虚心学，除了看各种文艺演出外，还到杂技团、歌舞团、武术队去请教；看杂志，看街头壁画，甚至观察北京的新型与古老的建筑物；等等。这些学习和观察，都不断地给了我们丰富的营养。在这过程中，我们曾花费很多时间去练武术、学流星，常常汗流满身。但我们知道只有刻苦的学习，才能把操编好。
    向各方面学习，启发了我们的思想。比如“青春的花朵”最后一个场面是对祖国和党、对和平和幸福的热烈歌颂，它应该像赞美诗一样。编出的第一方案经过实验后失败了；表现形式一般化，既不美也不感人。又苦思苦想很久也找不到恰当的形式，但在一次音乐会的大合唱中受到了启发，我觉得这个操的最后一场应该像大合唱一样，在表现形式上应该有几组不同的动作，在同一节奏下形成一个协调的整体；但又苦于动作不能破格。又有一次在舞蹈观摩会上看到了“向日葵舞”，其中一个葵花向着太阳转的场面，既有意义又特别好看，我真非常高兴，便决定把它从舞台上搬到运动场，经过适当的加工，使它更加优美。就这样，“青春的花朵”最后的场面艺术性更高了，含意更丰富了，从而更鲜明地突出了主题，有独特的民族形式，每演到这一场都博得观众热烈的掌声。
    开始创编农民操时，也由于思想不够明确，曾几次推翻了设计的方案。这时我看到了街道群众创作的壁画“大白菜下捉迷藏”、“小孩骑着肥猪跑”等，那种革命现实主义与革命浪漫主义相结合的精神，深深地启发了我。又看到农业展览馆里许多“卫星”农产品，了解到农业生产都是大面积的丰收，因此就抓住了这个关键，决定用农业大丰产来歌颂人民公社。又学习了苏联及南京团体操的麦浪动作，表现形式上采用大片的队形变化，使它有雄壮的气魄。这样，我们不仅学到了反映主题的手法与最好的表现形式，而且学习了如何在体操中体现革命现实主义与革命浪漫主义相结合的原则。
    一年多的团体操创编过程，也是党领导我们不断地进行两种思想斗争的过程。我们与个人主义，风头主义，不重视操的政治思想性，追求所谓的形式美和不相信群众，不走群众路线等资产阶级思想进行了斗争。工作开始时，我们分成几个小组，分头创编，就产生了各顾一摊的现象，把好的队形和表现形式不管是否恰当，尽量地编进自己的操里，产生了几个操表现形式的重复，不能使操多样化和突出每个操的特点；也造成了不团结现象，影响了创编的顺利进行。由于我们依靠了党，得到了党的教育，因而使同志们从全局出发，关心集体的工作，改变了过去那种只顾自己的局面，走向真正集体创编的道路。
    走群众路线就能多快好省
    操编成后，只有二十几天的排练时间，而参加表演的是北京市大、中、小学共四十几个学校的一万来人。在这样时间紧、任务重的情况下，又出现了如何组织排练的问题。有的同志怕别人排走了样，要由自己排练；有的同志到了排练的学校不能虚心地听取学校教师的意见。我们组织了讨论，统一了思想，根据党的指示，坚持在排练中走群众路线，把操下放给各校去教练。这样就调动了各校教师的积极性，他们在教练中也提出了不少有益的修改意见。因而使团体操多快好省地排练成功。
    通过团体操创编与排练的全部过程，使我们进一步认识到：只有依靠党的领导用无产阶级思想武装自己，不断地批判资产阶级思想，才能使工作不断前进。
    我们创编组全体同志经过一年多的时间，所以能取得这样的成绩，首先是由于党的领导，是由于毛主席思想指导的结果。因为只有党和毛主席的领导，我们才找到了正确的方向，摸到了创编的门路，产生了智慧和力量。其次，也是由于北京及全国有关单位和演出学校大力协作的结果；也是由于总路线、大跃进、人民公社对我们的鼓舞的结果；也是由于全组同志发挥了集体智慧的结果。我自己只不过是在集体工作中，作了一点我应该作的事情。我在这个过程中，应该说最大的收获是受到了多方面的深刻的教育。我深切地感激党给了我这么一个很好的受教育的机会。
    团体操是大型运动会所不可缺少的一项，它是检阅国家群众性体育运动水平的一个手段。今后我要继续研究团体操，为团体操的普及和提高而努力。要创作出更新更美的团体操。要在这个项目上，为祖国为党为毛主席，争取更大的光荣。
