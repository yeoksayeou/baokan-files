Cultural Revolution, Hygiene Takes the Lead
Yi Yaowen, First Secretary of the Jishan County Party Committee, Shanxi Province

    Walking into Jishan County, looking east, west, north, and south:
    Everywhere is clean and tidy, the four pests are hard to find,
    Everyone emphasizes hygiene, everyone is healthy.
    These are the words left by people from all over the country who came to visit Jishan in the "Suggestion Book."

    Jishan County is a good place with fertile land, abundant resources, and a mild climate. To the north are the rolling Lvliang Mountains, to the west is the roaring Yellow River, and to the south and east is a vast, boundless plain. The Fen River flows through the center year-round, producing all kinds of grains and miscellaneous crops. Every year when autumn harvests ripen, the famous plate jujubes fill the branches, shaking their red faces, smiling and celebrating the harvest with the busy commune members.

    But on this beautiful and rich land, during the era of the Chiang Kai-shek/Yan Xishan bandit gang's rule before liberation, it was scarred and pockmarked. The county's more than 300,000 people suffered deep oppression. Villages were deserted, land was barren, and people lived in misery. Everywhere was a desolate scene, and the state of culture and hygiene was even more backward. Landlords, ghosts and gods, quack doctors, witches, and plagues became the five poisonous snakes entrenched above the people. The countryside was littered with bricks, tiles, feces, and garbage. Plagues occurred year after year, and the mortality rate of the masses reached an alarming level.

    After liberation, the people of Jishan County completely freed themselves from exploitation and poverty. With the development of production, thousands of households spontaneously launched a broad and in-depth patriotic hygiene movement centered on eliminating pests and diseases. Over the past few years, through several large-scale mass movements and the persistent work of professional teams, urban and rural areas have become clean and flat everywhere, and streets and courtyards are filled with gardens; commune members' homes have improved windows and added sanitary facilities such as running water washbasins; toilets have all been improved to achieve no flies, no maggots, no odor, and new sanitary field toilets have been built; new types of sanitary pigsties, sheepfolds, livestock pens, and chicken farms have also been established; every village has implemented harmless treatment of feces; rats, bedbugs, flies, and mosquitoes have basically disappeared; health care organizations have achieved a situation where every commune has a hospital, every district has a health center, and every team has a health room, with one health worker for every ten households; collective welfare undertakings have added dust-free stoves, soil mechanization equipment, and public health facilities such as shower bathhouses in canteens. Hygiene has become regular, institutionalized, and habitual throughout the county. Since last winter and this spring, no epidemic of infectious diseases has occurred in any area of the county, and everyone is healthy and energetic.

    Emphasizing hygiene has not only brought a healthy and civilized life to the working people, but has also made everyone smarter. They have become masters of their own affairs and masters of their own destiny. In Xuejiabao, a small village of dozens of households, there is a 72-year-old woman named Huang Fengying. In the old society, because feudal superstition dominated her thinking, when her husband became ill, she did not ask a doctor but burned incense and kowtowed everywhere, praying to gods and Buddhas. As a result, her husband's illness became more and more serious, and he died soon after. She thought this was due to her own destiny, and she ran around to "do good deeds." When her children got sick, she did not treat them, and they all died as a result. During the patriotic hygiene movement, Huang Fengying's ideological awareness gradually improved. When she saw the incense burner that had been used by her ancestors for generations on the table, she became angry, so she took it down and used it as a spittoon. She is now very happy and wholeheartedly takes care of the children in the team's nursery, spending her happy life in her later years.

    The development of the hygiene cause has driven the entire cultural revolution in the county to a new stage of increasing prosperity. Profound changes have taken place in education, culture, science, sports, and other aspects. The county has basically achieved that every commune has a middle school, every district has a complete primary school, and every village has a junior primary school, and amateur senior primary school classes and amateur middle school classes have been established, with the number of participants reaching 92% of the total number of young and middle-aged people. Various sports teams have developed to nearly a thousand, with 310 youth sports schools, and the number of people participating in sports accounts for two-thirds of the county's population. Communes and management districts have established scientific research organizations, which are divided into experimental fields, crop cultivation, fertilizer, agricultural machinery, agricultural implement reform, animal husbandry, and agricultural meteorology groups according to production needs. Entertainment activities are even more rich and colorful, from small poems, novels, essays, travel notes, and biographies created by the masses to playing, pulling, plucking, playing, performing, singing, painting, clay sculpture, paper cutting, carving, embroidery, and so on, it is truly diverse and all-encompassing. The whole county, from toddlers, young men and women to the elderly, has been involved in this activity, and a large number of activists have emerged.

    The people of Jishan praise their hometown:

    Cultural Revolution, hygiene takes the lead,
    Build a good home, happiness is endless.

### 文化大革命，卫生打先锋

    文化大革命，卫生打先锋
    中共山西稷山县委第一书记　仪耀文
    走进稷山县，东西南北看：
    到处干干净，四害难找见，
    人人讲卫生，个个身康健。
    这是全国各地来稷山参观的人们，在“意见簿”上留下的字句。
    稷山县是个土地肥沃，资源丰富，气候温和的好地方。北面是峰峦起伏的吕梁山，西面紧靠着金涛滚滚的黄河，南面和东面是一望无际的辽阔大平原，中部终年汾水流贯，五谷杂粮，样样出产。每年到秋禾成熟的季节，著名的板枣压满枝头，摇着红艳艳的脸儿，向忙碌的社员们含笑欢庆丰收。
    但就在这块美丽富饶的土地上，在解放前蒋阎匪帮统治的年代里，却满身疮疤，全县三十多万人民受着深重的压迫，村无人烟，土地荒芜，民不聊生，到处一片凄凉的景象，文化卫生状况，更是落后不堪，地主、鬼神、庸医、巫婆、瘟病，成为盘踞在人民头上的五条毒蛇。农村遍地砖头、瓦块、粪便、垃圾。瘟病连年，群众死亡率达到惊人的程度。
    解放后，稷山县的人民彻底摆脱了剥削和贫困。随着生产的发展，千家万户，自动开展起了一个广泛深入的以除害灭病为中心的爱国卫生运动。几年来，经过多次大搞群众运动和专业队伍的坚持工作，城乡到处整洁平坦，街心庭院布满花园；社员家里改良了窗户，添置了流水洗脸器等卫生设备；厕所全部进行了改良，达到无蝇、无蛆、无臭味，并新建起了合乎卫生要求的田间厕所；新型的卫生猪圈、羊圈、牲口圈、鸡场也建立起来了；村村实行了粪便无害化处理；老鼠、臭虫、苍蝇、蚊子，基本根绝踪迹；卫生保健组织实现了社社有医院、区区有保健站、队队有保健室，十户一个卫生员；集体福利事业中增设了食堂的无尘灶、土机械化设备和淋浴澡塘等公共卫生设备。卫生已在全县形成了经常化、制度化、习惯化。去冬今春以来，在全县任何一个地区，根本没有发生过传染病的流行，人人身体健康，精神旺盛。
    讲卫生不但给劳动人民带来了健康文明的生活，而且使每个人都变得聪明了。他们当了家，作了主，自己成为命运的主宰。在薛家堡这个数十户人家的小村庄里，有个七十二岁的黄凤英老大娘，在旧社会时由于封建迷信统治着她的思想，丈夫得了病不去请医生，整天到处烧香磕头，求神拜佛的结果使她丈夫的病越来越严重，不久便死了。她以为这是自己命运造就的，还是东奔西跑去“行善”，孩子得了病也不去治疗，结果又都死去了。在开展爱国卫生运动中，黄老大娘的思想觉悟逐渐提高了，这时她一看到桌子上放着祖祖辈辈使用的香炉，心里就气起来，于是便把它搬下来做了痰盂。她现在心里非常愉快，一心一意在队里托儿所照管着孩子，正在度着自己晚年幸福的生活。
    卫生事业的发展，带动了全县整个文化革命也走上了一个日益繁荣昌盛的新阶段，教育、文化、科学、体育等各方面都起了深刻的变化。全县基本上实现社有中学、区有完小、村有初小，并建立起了业余高小班，业余中学班，参加学习的人数达到青壮年总人数的92％。各种体育锻炼队发展到近一千个，青少年体育学校三百一十座，参加运动的人数占全县人口的三分之二。公社、管理区都成立了科学研究组织，按生产需要分为试验田、作物栽培、肥料、农业机械、农具改革、畜牧饲养、农业气象等小组。文娱活动更是丰富多彩，从群众创作的小诗歌、小说、散文、游记、传记一直到吹、拉、弹、奏、演、唱和绘画、泥塑、剪纸、雕刻、刺绣等，真是五花八门，应有尽有。全县从幼儿、男女青年到老人，都卷入到这个活动中来，并涌现出大批积极分子。
    稷山人民赞美自己的家乡道：
    文化大革命，卫生打先锋，
    建设好家园，幸福乐无穷。
