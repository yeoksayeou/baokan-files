Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Japanese Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and other opposition parties strongly condemned the fascist act of the Kishi Nobusuke group in starting a separate "deliberation" of the aggressive U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty in the Senate on the 8th.

On the afternoon of the 8th, members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party of Japan began a separate discussion of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in the Senate "Special Committee on the Security Treaty." Members of all parties other than the Liberal Democratic Party did not participate in the discussion.

The Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on the 9th, pointing out, "The Kishi group is now attempting to have the so-called plenary session of the Senate approve the revised Security Treaty without waiting for the treaty's so-called 'natural establishment' on June 19. The Kishi group's doing so once again exposes its traitorous nature."

The statement said, "Our party declares that any decision made in the Senate, which is boycotted by all opposition parties, is invalid both legally and morally." The statement said, "We reiterate our demand: the Kishi government should immediately be replaced by a caretaker government composed of all parliamentary forces except the Kishi group, and a general election should be held under the auspices of this government."

The Japanese Socialist Party issued a statement on the 8th, stating: The Liberal Democratic Party's separate deliberation is a destruction of the parliamentary system. The government and the Liberal Democratic Party should bear full responsibility for the chaos in the Diet caused by this crude behavior.

The Socialist Party demanded in the statement that deliberations on the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" be stopped immediately.

The Democratic Socialist Party's Senate caucus issued a statement on the 8th, saying that the Liberal Democratic Party's actions would only deepen the crisis. The root of the current political crisis is the Liberal Democratic Party's hasty "passage" of the treaty in the House of Representatives. The statement said, "We cannot consider the ruling party's one-sided attitude of starting its own discussion in the Senate to be correct."

Otaké Heihachiro, chairman of the Diet Countermeasures Committee of the "Senate Comrades Association," told reporters that his organization clearly opposes the ruling party's adoption of this fascist attitude. He went on to say, "We will never participate in Senate meetings until the Diet returns to normal. The Liberal Democrats dare to start discussing the treaty on their own; they will inevitably be subjected to sharper criticism from public opinion."

Many newspapers opposed the Kishi Nobusuke group's separate deliberation of the treaty in the Senate, regarding it as lawless action.

The "Tokyo Shimbun" published an editorial on the 8th, saying that the ruling party's forced separate deliberation of the treaty will inevitably make the people more distrustful of the government.

Yabe Teiji, president of Takushoku University, wrote in this newspaper that the best way to end the abnormal state of the Diet is to immediately dissolve the House of Representatives and re-debate the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in the new Diet.

An article written by Waseda University professor Yoshimura Tadashi said that the only possible way to get the Diet out of its current "crisis" is for the Kishi Nobusuke government to resign en masse and for the House of Representatives to be dissolved by a caretaker government.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 9th: According to the "Mainichi Shimbun" today, the Kishi Nobusuke group, which started separate deliberations on the new "Security Treaty" in the Senate on the 8th, intends to forcibly "pass" the treaty on June 15 or 16 in order to avoid meeting Eisenhower's visit to Japan in the even more disgraceful situation of the treaty's "natural establishment" on June 19.

Today's "Sankei Shimbun" and "Tokyo Times" reported that the Kishi Nobusuke government plans to exchange ratification documents with the U.S. government in Tokyo on June 25.

At the same time, there are reports that Miki Takeo, a member of the "anti-mainstream faction" within the Liberal Democratic Party, met with the party's Secretary-General Kawashima Shojiro on the 8th and expressed his dissatisfaction with the Kishi Nobusuke group's decision to deliberate on the new "Security Treaty" separately in the Senate.

The Kyushu Asahi Broadcasting Corporation reported that representatives of the Matsumura-Miki faction, the Kono faction, and the Ishibashi faction, among other "anti-mainstream factions," held a liaison meeting on the 9th. At the meeting, some strongly advocated that Kishi Nobusuke should be forced to step down before the new "Security Treaty" is passed. The meeting decided to convene the anti-Kishi Diet members' assembly, originally scheduled for the 17th or 18th, earlier, on June 14.

    自由民主党在参议院开始单独“审议”日美条约
    日本在野党谴责岸信介集团新罪行
    日共再次声明要求岸内阁辞职并举行大选
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：日本共产党、社会党和其他在野党等强烈谴责岸信介集团8日在参议院开始单独“审议”侵略性日美军事同盟条约的法西斯行为。
    日本执政党自由民主党议员8日下午开始在参议院“安全条约特别委员会”单独讨论新日美“安全条约”。除了自由民主党以外，其他各政党的议员都没有参加讨论。
    日本共产党中央委员会干部会9日发表声明指出，“岸集团现在企图使所谓参议院全体会议批准修改后的安全条约而不等到6月19日条约的所谓‘自然成立’。岸集团这样做再次暴露了它的卖国贼的性质。”
    声明说，“我党声明，在受到所有反对党抵制的参议院中所作出的任何决定，无论在法律上和道义上都是无效。”声明说，“我们重申我们的要求：岸政府应当立即由除了岸集团以外的所有议会力量所组成的看守政府来代替，并在这个政府主持下举行大选。”
    日本社会党8日发表声明说：自由民主党的单独审议是破坏议会制度的。由于这种粗暴行为而使国会陷于混乱状态的责任应该完全由政府和自由民主党承担。
    社会党在声明中要求立即停止审议新日美“安全条约”。
    民主社会党参议院议会团8日发表声明说，自由民主党这样做只会加深危机，产生目前的政治危机的根源就是自由民主党人匆匆在众议院“通过”条约。声明说，“我们不能认为执政党开始在参议院独自讨论的片面态度是对的。”
    “参议院同志会”的国会对策委员会委员长大竹平八郎对记者说，他的组织明确地反对执政党采取这种法西斯的态度。他接着说，“在国会恢复正常状态以前，我们决不参加参议院的会议。自由民主党人竟敢开始独自讨论条约，他们必将遭到舆论更尖锐的指责。”
    许多报纸对岸信介集团在参议院单独审议这项条约表示反对，认为这是无法无天的行动。
    “东京新闻”8日发表社论说，执政党强行单独审议条约必将使人民对政府更加不信任。
    拓殖大学校长矢部贞治在这家报纸上著文说，结束国会不正常状态的最好办法是立即解散众议院，在新国会重新辩论新日美“安全条约”。
    早稻田大学教授吉村正写的文章说，使国会脱离目前“危机”的唯一可能的办法是岸信介政府总辞职和由看守政府把众议院解散。
    据新华社9日讯　东京消息：据“每日新闻”今天揭露，岸信介集团从8日开始在参议院单独审议新
  “安全条约”，是打算在6月15日或16日强行“通过”这项条约，以避免在6月19日条约“自然成立”这种更不体面的形势下迎接艾森豪威尔访日。
    今天的“产经新闻”和“东京时报”报道，岸信介政府打算在6月25日在东京同美国政府交换批准书。
    同时，有消息说，自由民主党内“反主流派”的三木武夫8日会晤这个党的干事长川岛正次郎，对岸信介集团决定在参议院单独审议新“安全条约”表示不满。
    九州朝日广播电台报道，松村—三木派、河野派和石桥派等“反主流派”的代表9日举行联络会议，会上有人强烈主张应该在通过新“安全条约”以前迫使岸信介下台。会议决定提早在6月14日召开原定在17日或18日召开的倒岸议员大会。
