    The National Congress of Advanced Units and Advanced Workers in Socialist Construction in Education and Culture, Health, Sports, and Journalism is convened in Beijing today. This marks the high tide of the cultural revolution in our country. The more than six thousand representatives attending this grand gathering of heroes, coming from all corners of the motherland, represent numerous advanced collectives and advanced workers on the cultural and educational front, and represent the seven million professional and thirty million amateur cultural and educational workers across the country, bringing with them the glorious achievements and valuable experiences on the cultural and educational front. We extend our congratulations to the representatives, to the vast number of advanced collectives and advanced workers on the cultural and educational front, and to all cultural and educational workers across the country! This congress will review the brilliant achievements of the cultural and educational front in the past, commend the advanced, exchange experiences, strengthen unity, and inspire greater revolutionary enthusiasm to push our country's cultural revolution to a new high tide. This is a congress of celebration, as well as a congress of learning, a congress of unity, and a congress of oath-taking. We warmly congratulate the success of the congress!
    As we extend our warm congratulations to the representatives of the cultural and educational heroes with excitement, we hear a huge voice: "The era when the Chinese people were considered uncivilized has passed. We will appear in the world as a nation with a high degree of culture." This is the solemn declaration made by Comrade Mao Zedong at the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in September 1949. Only a little over ten years have passed since then, and our country's cultural revolution has begun to achieve great successes. We are beginning to draw the newest and most beautiful pictures on a blank sheet of paper. Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the Chinese people have resolutely eliminated the influence of feudalism, bureaucratic capitalism, and imperialism, especially American imperialism, in the fields of culture and education, while at the same time extensively developing socialist cultural and educational undertakings, and have also persistently launched the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, socialism and capitalism in the field of culture and education, establishing the leadership of the proletariat over cultural and educational undertakings. In this way, with the development of socialist revolution and socialist construction, our country's socialist cultural and educational undertakings have also developed greatly. In particular, since the Party Central Committee formulated the General Line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism in 1958, and the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the great task of the cultural revolution and the policy of "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor," the development of our country's cultural and educational undertakings has since entered a new stage.
    The cultural revolution is to intellectualize the worker and peasant masses, and at the same time to laborize the intellectuals. This is an extremely profound revolution. In this revolution, the worker and peasant masses and intellectuals in our country have been deeply tempered, their spiritual outlook has undergone tremendous changes, and a contingent of cultural and educational cadres with proletarian intellectuals as the backbone has begun to take shape. An unprecedentedly prosperous scene has emerged in our country's cultural and educational undertakings. By implementing the Party's policy of "walking on two legs," with the whole Party and the whole people engaged in running education, we have found the correct path to popularizing and improving universal education with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. At present, our country has eliminated illiteracy for more than 100 million people, the enrollment rate of school-age children has reached more than 80%, the number of students in full-time secondary schools and secondary vocational schools has reached 12.9 million, exceeding 5.8 times the highest year in old China (1946), the number of students in full-time colleges and universities has reached more than 810,000, exceeding 4.2 times the highest year in old China (1947), and agricultural middle schools and all levels and types of spare-time education have developed extremely rapidly like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. The vast number of schools have combined education with productive labor, eliminating the influence of the separation of theory from practice left over from bourgeois education, and opening up a broad road for cultivating intellectuals of the working class. Our literary and art workers are advancing along the road of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers, vividly expressing the new era, new people, and new ideas of socialism, making the cultural life of the broad masses of people flourish and become rich and colorful. We have launched a patriotic health campaign to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene, which is unprecedented in history, and has achieved the effects of changing customs and habits and "increasing production in the fields and increasing the lifespan of people." We have extensively developed mass sports activities in accordance with the principle of sports serving labor production and national defense construction, enhanced the physical fitness of the people, and made our country's sports reach international levels in many aspects. The scale and speed of the development of our cultural and educational undertakings are not only unprecedented in our country's history, but also beyond the reach of any capitalist country that prides itself on bourgeois "civilization."
    The achievements of our country's cultural revolution have been great. However, our country's cultural revolution is now only just beginning. For us, the achievement of any great success is only the starting point for moving towards new and greater achievements. We must continue to carry out the cultural revolution continuously, so that our country's cultural and educational undertakings have a larger scale and a higher level.
    The current task of the cultural revolution is, on the one hand, to accelerate the popularization and improvement of universal education, so that hundreds of millions of workers and peasants have increasingly higher cultural and scientific knowledge, and to realize the intellectualization of workers and peasants; on the other hand, to adhere to the policy of intellectuals participating in physical labor and combining education with productive labor, and to realize the laborization of intellectuals. The intellectualization of workers and peasants and the laborization of intellectuals are unified and inseparable. It is one-sided and incorrect to regard the cultural revolution as merely a problem of popularizing education, or merely a problem of intellectualizing workers and peasants.
    Popularizing and improving universal education is a major task of the cultural revolution. In terms of long-term goals, the universal education we require is not only to eliminate illiteracy and popularize primary and secondary education, but also to popularize higher education. We must make unremitting efforts to achieve this goal. At present, the first priority is to strive to basically complete the elimination of illiteracy among young and middle-aged workers and peasants and basically popularize primary education among school-age children during the Second Five-Year Plan period, that is, by 1962; and strive to basically popularize junior high school education during the Third Five-Year Plan period; At the same time, vigorously develop senior high school education, secondary vocational education, and higher education, vigorously develop spare-time education at all levels and types, and vigorously develop preschool education. This is an extremely arduous and glorious task, requiring huge work from Party committees at all levels, all cultural and educational workers, and all the people. In order to accelerate the popularization and improvement of universal education, it is necessary to further implement the policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, and to carry out educational revolution and teaching reform in a planned and step-by-step manner. At present, it is particularly necessary to reform the current primary and secondary school system in accordance with the principles of appropriately shortening the duration of schooling, appropriately increasing the level of education, appropriately controlling class hours, and appropriately increasing labor. Full-time colleges and universities must also carry out teaching reforms. The purpose of the reforms is to improve students' level of basic scientific knowledge, and at the same time enable students to learn more extensive knowledge and become "one specialty with multiple skills" talents. In order to popularize and improve universal education, it is necessary to further establish a more complete education system throughout the country, including various regions. Provinces, cities, autonomous regions, counties, and people's communes should all consider the rational layout of education, run full-time and part-time schools of all levels and types and spare-time education in a big way, and develop various cultural, health, sports, and other undertakings.
    We must consciously carry the class struggle in the ideological field through to the end. This is the basic core of the cultural revolution. The struggle of the Chinese people against the bourgeois rightists in 1957 and the struggle against right-leaning opportunism in 1959 were great victories of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. These victories cleared the way forward for the great leap forward in our country's economic and cultural construction. However, we must estimate the long-term nature of the struggle. As Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out, "The struggle to decide who will win between socialism and capitalism in the ideological field will still take a considerable amount of time to resolve. This is because the influence of the bourgeoisie and intellectuals from the old society will continue to exist in our country for a long time, and as the ideology of a class, it will continue to exist in our country for a long time." And the American imperialists, as well as the modern revisionists who serve American imperialism, have recently been intensifying their efforts to implement their conspiracies to use bourgeois ideology to corrupt the people of socialist countries. Of course, this conspiracy of imperialism is doomed to fail, but it must arouse our serious attention and vigilance to continue to conduct in-depth struggles against domestic bourgeois ideology, against the ideological influence of imperialism and modern revisionism in all areas of ideology, until this struggle achieves a complete victory.
    Countless historical experiences have proven that learning and mastering Marxism-Leninism, learning Mao Zedong Thought, which combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution and construction, is the most important guarantee for us to be invincible in this struggle. In recent years, the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works has been widely carried out among cultural and educational workers, and ideological transformation has been continuously carried out. This has greatly improved people's political and ideological level and ideological awareness, enabling people to enhance their immunity and combat effectiveness in the struggle against bourgeois ideology. It has also greatly improved people's ability to use the dialectical method of Marxism-Leninism to analyze things, thereby more consciously implementing the Party's guidelines and policies and carrying out creative work. The task of the cultural revolution before us is glorious and huge. To achieve this task, we must study Mao Zedong's works even harder, further criticize and overcome the bourgeois worldview, establish and consolidate the proletarian worldview, and apply dialectical materialism in practical work. Cultural and educational workers must raise their political and ideological level to a new height in order to more powerfully promote the new upsurge of the cultural revolution unfolding before us.
    The advanced units and advanced workers in socialist construction in the fields of culture, education, health, sports, and journalism across the country, you have played the role of vanguards in the past struggles and have set a good example for all cultural and educational workers. We believe that inspired by the great cause of the Party's cultural revolution, you will continue to play a better leading role, backbone role, and bridge role. The cultural revolution is a personal undertaking of hundreds of millions of people. It is necessary for the whole Party to take action, for the whole people to take action, to unite all forces that can be united, to go all out, aim high, and carry out the work of socialist cultural revolution and construction with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Comrade Mao Zedong once issued a solemn call in "On New Democracy": "We must not only transform a China that is politically oppressed and economically exploited into a China that is politically free and economically prosperous, but also transform a China that is ruled by the old culture and is therefore ignorant and backward into a China that is ruled by the new culture and is therefore civilized and advanced." Now, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the people of our country are making the greatest efforts to realize this great historical mission. Let us hold high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought and push our country's cultural revolution and socialist construction to new heights!

    迎接新的更大的文化革命高潮
    全国教育和文化、卫生、体育、新闻等方面社会主义建设先进单位和先进工作者代表大会今天在北京召开，这是我国文化革命高潮的标志。参加这次盛大的群英会的六千多位代表，从祖国的四面八方，代表着文化教育战线上许许多多的先进集体和先进工作者，代表着全国七百多万专业的和三千多万业余的文化教育工作者，带来了文教战线上的光辉的成就和宝贵的经验。我们谨向代表们祝贺，向文化教育战线上广大的先进集体和先进工作者祝贺，向全国所有的文化教育工作者祝贺！这次大会将检阅过去文教战线上的辉煌成就，表扬先进，交流经验，加强团结，鼓起更大的革命干劲，把我国的文化革命推向新的高潮。这是一个庆功的大会，也是一个学习的大会、团结的大会、誓师的大会。我们热烈地祝贺大会成功！
    当着我们以兴奋的心情向文教群英会的代表们致以热烈祝贺的时候，我们的耳边响着一个巨大的声音：“中国人被人认为不文明的时代已经过去了，我们将以一个具有高度文化的民族出现于世界。”这是1949年9月毛泽东同志在中国人民政协第一届全体会议上发出的庄严的宣告。从那时到现在，时间仅仅过去了十年多，我国的文化革命已经开始取得巨大的成绩，我们在一张白纸上，开始描绘出最新最美的图画。解放以来，中国人民在党的领导下，坚决肃清文化教育领域里的封建主义、官僚资本主义和帝国主义特别是美帝国主义的影响，同时大量地兴办社会主义文化教育事业，又在文化教育领域中坚持不懈地展开无产阶级和资产阶级、社会主义和资本主义的斗争，确立了无产阶级对文化教育事业的领导权。这样，随着社会主义革命和社会主义建设的发展，我国的社会主义文化教育事业也相应地有了很大的发展。特别是1958年党中央制定了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，党中央和毛泽东同志提出文化革命的伟大任务，提出“教育为无产阶级的政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针以后，我国文化教育事业的发展，从此就进入了一个新阶段。
    文化革命就是使工农群众知识化，同时使知识分子劳动化。这是一个极其深刻的革命。在这个革命中，我国工农群众和知识分子受到了深刻的锻炼，他们的精神面貌发生了巨大的变化，以无产阶级知识分子为骨干的文化教育干部队伍已经开始形成。我国的文化教育事业出现了空前繁荣的景象。由于执行了党的“两条腿走路”的方针，全党全民动手大办教育，我们找到了多快好省地普及和提高全民教育的正确道路。目前我国已经扫除了一亿以上的文盲，学龄儿童的就学率达到80％以上，全日制中等学校和中等专业学校学生达到一千二百九十万人，超过旧中国最高年份（1946年）五点八倍，全日制高等学校学生达到八十一万多人，超过旧中国最高年份（1947年）四点二倍，农业中学和各级各类的业余教育更如雨后春笋，发展极快。广大学校把教育与生产劳动结合起来，消除了资产阶级教育遗留下来的理论与实际脱节的影响，开创了学与用相结合的新局面，从而为培养工人阶级的知识分子开辟了一条宽广的道路。我们的文艺工作者沿着与工农兵结合的道路大步前进，生动活泼地表现了社会主义的新时代、新人物和新思想，使广大人民的文化生活百花齐放，丰富多彩。我们开展了历史上从未有过的除四害讲卫生的爱国卫生运动，收到了移风易俗和“田增产、人增寿”的效果。我们按照体育为劳动生产和国防建设服务的原则，广泛发展群众性的体育运动，增强了人民的体质，并且使我国的体育运动在许多方面达到了国际水平。我们文化教育事业发展的规模和速度，不但在我国历史上是空前的，也是以资产阶级“文明”自诩的任何资本主义国家所望尘莫及的。
    我国文化革命已经取得的成就是巨大的。但是，我国的文化革命现在还仅仅是开始。对于我们说来，任何伟大成就的取得只不过是迈向新的更伟大的成就的起点。我们必须把文化革命不断地进行下去，使我国的文化教育事业，具有更大的规模和更高的水准。
    当前文化革命的任务是，一方面要加快全民教育的普及和提高，使几亿工农群众具有越来越高的文化和科学知识，实现工农群众知识化；一方面要坚持贯彻知识分子参加体力劳动，和教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，实现知识分子劳动化。工农群众知识化和知识分子劳动化是统一而不可分的，如果把文化革命看作只是一个普及教育问题，或者只是一个工农群众知识化问题，是片面的，不正确的。
    普及和提高全民教育，是文化革命的一个主要任务。从长远的目标来说，我们所要求的普及教育，不仅是要扫除文盲、普及中小学教育，而且要普及高等教育。我们必须坚持不懈地努力达到这一目标。而在当前，首先是要力争在第二个五年计划，即到1962年为止的期间，基本上完成在青壮年工农群众中扫除文盲，和在学龄儿童中基本上普及小学教育；力争在第三个五年计划期间基本上普及初中教育；同时大力发展高中教育、中等专业教育和高等教育，大力发展各级各类业余教育，大力发展幼儿教育。这是一个极其艰巨而又光荣的任务，需要各级党委、全体文化教育工作者和全体人民进行巨大的工作。为了加快全民教育的普及和提高，必须进一步贯彻教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，有计划、有步骤地进行教育革命和教学改革。当前，特别需要根据适当缩短年限、适当提高程度、适当控制学时、适当增加劳动的原则，改革现行中小学学制。全日制高等学校也要进行教学改革，改革的目的，是在于提高学生的基础科学知识水平，同时使学生学习到更广博的知识，成为“一专多能”的人才。为了普及和提高全民教育事业，必须在全国包括各个地区在内进一步建立起更完整的教育体系。省、市、自治区、县、人民公社，都应该考虑教育事业的合理布局，大办各级各类全日制、半日制学校和业余教育，和发展各项文化、卫生、体育等事业。
    我们必须自觉地把思想领域里的阶级斗争进行到底，这是文化革命的基本核心。1957年我国人民反对资产阶级右派的斗争，和1959年反对右倾机会主义的斗争，是政治战线和思想战线上社会主义革命的伟大胜利。这些胜利为我国经济和文化建设事业的大跃进扫清了前进道路上的障碍。但是，必须估计到斗争的长期性，正如毛泽东同志所指出的，“社会主义和资本主义之间在意识形态方面谁胜谁负的斗争，还需要一个相当长的时间才能解决。这是因为资产阶级和从旧社会来的知识分子的影响还要在我国长期存在，作为阶级的意识形态，还要在我国长期存在。”而美帝国主义者，以及为美帝国主义服务的现代修正主义者，近来正在加紧施展其以资产阶级思想来腐蚀社会主义国家人民的阴谋诡计。当然，帝国主义的这种阴谋是注定要失败的，但是，必须引起我们的严重注意和警惕，在意识形态的各个领域里，继续深入地同国内的资产阶级思想，同帝国主义的思想影响和现代修正主义思想进行斗争，直到这个斗争获得彻底的胜利。
    历史的无数次经验证明，学习和掌握马克思列宁主义，学习马克思列宁主义普遍真理同中国革命和建设的具体实际相结合的毛泽东思想，是我们在这个斗争中无往而不胜的最重要的保证。几年来在文化教育工作者中间，广泛地开展了马克思列宁主义和毛泽东著作的学习，不断地进行思想改造。这就大大提高了人们的政治思想水平和思想觉悟程度，使得人们在同资产阶级思想的斗争中增强了免疫力和战斗力。这也大大提高了人们运用马克思列宁主义的辩证方法分析事物的能力，从而比较自觉地贯彻执行党的方针政策，进行创造性的工作。摆在我们面前的文化革命的任务是光荣的，也是巨大的。要实现这个任务，我们就必须更加努力地学习毛泽东著作，进一步批判和克服资产阶级世界观，树立和巩固无产阶级世界观，在实际工作中运用辩证唯物论。文化教育工作者必须把自己的政治思想水平提到新的高度，才能更有力地推动展现在我们面前的文化革命新高潮。
    全国文化、教育、卫生、体育、新闻等方面的社会主义建设先进单位和先进工作者，你们在过去的斗争中已经发挥了尖兵的作用，为全体文化教育工作者作出了良好的榜样。我们相信，在党的文化革命的伟大事业的鼓舞下，你们必将继续更好地发挥带头作用、骨干作用、桥梁作用。文化革命是亿万人的切身事业。必须全党动手，全民动手，团结一切可能团结的力量，鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地进行社会主义的文化革命和建设的工作。毛泽东同志在“新民主主义论”中曾经发出庄严的号召：“我们不但要把一个政治上受压迫、经济上受剥削的中国，变为一个政治上自由和经济上繁荣的中国，而且要把一个被旧文化统治因而愚昧落后的中国，变为一个被新文化统治因而文明先进的中国。”现在，我国人民正在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的英明领导下，以最大的努力实现这一伟大的历史使命。让我们高举毛泽东思想的旗帜，把我国的文化革命和社会主义建设事业推向新的高峰！
