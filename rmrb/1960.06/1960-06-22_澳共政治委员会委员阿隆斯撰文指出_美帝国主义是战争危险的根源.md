Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch from Sydney: The Australian Communist Party's organ, "Communist Review," published an article in its June issue written by Laurie Aarons, a member of the Political Committee of the Australian Communist Party, entitled "America Wrecks Summit Conference." The article pointed out that the fact that the United States wrecked the four-power summit conference once again proves that "US imperialism is a constant source of war danger." The article also emphatically pointed out: "As long as imperialism still rules in any country, the threat of war continues to exist."

The article said that the history of the twentieth century has proven more than once that imperialism is the root of war. The huge monopoly forces in imperialist countries drive them to carry out economic penetration, military conquest, and enslavement of other countries.

The article said, "This is manifested in the two world wars, in the colonial wars of British imperialism in Malaya, Cyprus, and Suez, in the wars of French imperialism in Vietnam and Algeria, in the United States' intervention in Korea and the Middle East, and in their constant intervention in Europe and Asia." The article said that US imperialism still clings to its nightmare of an "American century."

The article pointed out that the US ruling clique has never been sincere about holding a summit conference. They are even less willing to end the "Cold War."

The article then listed in detail the various conspiratorial activities of the United States in trying every possible means to sabotage the four-power summit conference after being forced to agree to hold it, such as signing the so-called "security treaty" with the old war criminal Nobusuke Kishi, continuing to violate China's territorial waters and airspace, announcing the implementation of a policy of "preemptive war," resuming nuclear weapons testing, and sending U-2 spy planes to intrude into Soviet airspace, etc.

The article also pointed out that Wall Street's reaction to the destruction of the four-power summit was a sharp rise in arms stocks, which once again fully demonstrated the economic interests behind the imperialist policies of the US ruling class.

The article said, but the imperialists and their social system are doomed to die. They cannot intimidate the socialist countries, nor can they win in the wars they plan. The people of the colonial world will no longer succumb to their commands. The article cited South Korea and Turkey as examples to show that imperialism and its lackeys are not safe anywhere.

The article also said that the working class in capitalist countries is launching a firm struggle against its rulers' war plans.

The article pointed out that the actions of the US imperialists in sabotaging the four-power summit conference only further exposed them, making the forces for peace vigilant and stronger, thus, they themselves hammered another nail into the coffin of world imperialism.

The article said that the forces of peace are stronger than the forces of imperialism and war. However, only if the forces of peace remain vigilant, combative, and determined can they defeat the forces of imperialism and war.

    澳共政治委员会委员阿隆斯撰文指出
    美帝国主义是战争危险的根源
    只要帝国主义仍然在任何国家内统治着，战争的威胁就继续存在；只有和平力量保持警惕，富有战斗精神并且坚强决心，才能战胜帝国主义和战争的力量。
    新华社21日讯　悉尼消息：澳大利亚共产党机关刊“共产主义者评论”6月号发表了澳大利亚共产党政治委员会委员劳里斯·阿隆斯写的一篇题为“美国破坏最高级会议”的文章。文章指出，美国破坏四国首脑会议的事实又一次证明，“美帝国主义是经常存在的战争危险的根源”。文章还着重指出：“只要帝国主义仍然在任何国家内统治着，战争的威胁就继续存在”。
    文章说，二十世纪的历史不止一次地证明了帝国主义是战争的根源。帝国主义国家里巨大的垄断势力驱使它们到其他国家进行经济渗透，军事征服和奴役其他国家。
    文章说，“这表现在两次世界大战，表现在英帝国主义在马来亚、塞浦路斯和苏伊士的殖民战争，表现在法帝国主义在越南和阿尔及利亚的战争，表现在美国对朝鲜和中东进行干涉，表现在他们不断地在欧洲和亚洲进行的干涉。”文章说，美帝国主义仍然抱住他们“美国世纪”的恶梦不放。
    文章指出，美国统治集团从来没有诚意举行一次政府首脑会议。他们更不乐意结束“冷战”。
    这篇文章接着详细地列举了美国在被迫同意举行四国首脑会议以后千方百计地破坏这个会议的各种阴谋活动，如它同老牌战犯岸信介签订了所谓“安全条约”，继续侵犯中国的领海和领空，宣布要执行“先发制人的战争”政策，恢复核武器试验，并且派遣U—2型间谍飞机侵入苏联领空等。
    这篇文章还指出，华尔街对破坏四国首脑会议的反应是军火股票的猛涨，这又一次充分表明了美国统治阶级的帝国主义政策后面的经济利益。
    文章说，但是帝国主义者和他们的社会制度注定要死亡。他们吓不倒社会主义国家，他们也不能在他们所计划的战争中取得胜利。殖民地世界的人民将不再屈服于他们的指挥。这篇文章举出南朝鲜和土耳其的例子说明帝国主义及其走狗在任何地方都不保险。
    文章还说，资本主义国家的工人阶级正在发起一个反对它的统治者战争计划的坚定斗争。
    文章指出，美帝国主义者破坏四国首脑会议的行动只是进一步暴露了他们，使争取和平的力量保持警惕和更加强大，从而，他们自己把另一枚钉子钉进世界帝国主义的棺材上。
    文章说，和平力量比帝国主义和战争的力量强大。但是，只有和平力量保持警惕，富有战斗精神并且坚强决心，才能战胜帝国主义和战争的力量。
