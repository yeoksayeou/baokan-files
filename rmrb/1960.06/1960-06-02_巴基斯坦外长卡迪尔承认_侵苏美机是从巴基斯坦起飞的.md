Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, 31st. According to a press release issued here by the Pakistani government on the evening of the 31st, Pakistani Foreign Minister Manzur Qadir plainly admitted during an interview on the American Broadcasting Company's television program in Washington on May 29th that the U.S. spy plane that violated Soviet airspace was one of many American planes that took off from the Peshawar airport.

Qadir said, "Since the United States has not denied the claim that the plane shot down in the Soviet Union took off from the Peshawar airport, we must say that the plane shot down in the Soviet Union was one of the planes that took off from the Peshawar airport."

Qadir further admitted that U.S. planes not only took off from the Peshawar airport, but also from other airports in Pakistan.

Qadir also discussed the issue of maps published in the U.S. "New York Times" and "Newsweek" that depicted Pakistan as a U.S. base. He said that Pakistan does provide facilities to the United States in terms of airports. He also said that the U.S. government requested certain "facilities" to conduct "weather reconnaissance flights," and Pakistan has granted those "facilities" to the United States.

Qadir said that U.S. espionage activities put Pakistan in greater danger.

Qadir also said that Pakistani President Ayub Khan had suggested a joint defense between India and Pakistan and is now awaiting Nehru's acceptance of this proposal.

    巴基斯坦外长卡迪尔承认
    侵苏美机是从巴基斯坦起飞的
    新华社卡拉奇31日电　据巴基斯坦政府31日晚间在这里发表的新闻公报说，巴基斯坦外交部长曼祖尔·卡迪尔5月29日在华盛顿美国广播公司的电视节目中讲话时明白地承认美国侵犯苏联的那架间谍飞机是从白沙瓦机场起飞的许多美国飞机之一。
    卡迪尔说，“由于在美国并没有否认在苏联被击落的那架飞机是从白沙瓦机场起飞的这种说法，我们必须说，在苏联被击落的那架飞机是从白沙瓦机场起飞的飞机当中的一架。”
    卡迪尔还进一步承认，美国飞机不仅从白沙瓦机场起飞，而且还从巴基斯坦其他的机场起飞。
    卡迪尔还谈到了美国“纽约时报”和“新闻周刊”刊出的地图上把巴基斯坦画成是美国的一个基地的问题。他说，巴基斯坦在机场方面为美国提供便利，那是有的。他还说，美国政府要求得到进行“气候侦察飞行”的某些“方便”，巴基斯坦也已经把那些“方便”给了美国。
    卡迪尔说，美国的间谍活动使巴基斯坦面临更大的危险。
    卡迪尔还说，巴基斯坦总统阿尤布汗曾建议印度和巴基斯坦进行联合防御，现在正期待尼赫鲁接受这项建议。
