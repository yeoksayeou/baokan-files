    Chongqing Metallurgy, Coal, Transportation and Other Departments Launch "One-Dragon" Competition
    Production, Transportation and Sales Collaborate to Ensure High Steel Production in June
    Huainan Coal Mine Achieves a Flying Start in June, Creating the Highest Daily Output Record of the Year

    (Reported by our newspaper) In order to further strengthen the cooperation and coordination between the production, transportation, and sales departments, and to ensure the successful completion of the steel protection transportation tasks in June, recently, Chongqing's metallurgy, coal, electricity, port, and railway transportation departments launched a joint steel protection production, transportation, and sales "one-dragon" competition.

    Many Chongqing steel protection materials such as coal coke, pig iron, and ore must be transported by rail. To accelerate transportation turnover and improve transportation efficiency, in addition to the railway department's own efforts, coal mines, steel plants, and other production and sales departments must also speed up loading and unloading times, so that each link of a train, from loading, transportation, to unloading, is closely connected. The one-dragon joint steel protection competition of metallurgy, coal, electricity, port, railway and other production, transportation and sales departments specially organized sixteen direct trains from coal mines to Chongqing Iron and Steel, from iron plants to Chongqing Iron and Steel, from coal mines to Chongqing Power Plant, and from coal mines to iron plants and other factories and mines, responsible for transporting steel protection materials. In order to ensure the smooth operation of the above-mentioned sixteen direct trains, the Chongqing Office of the Chengdu Railway Bureau guarantees to transport as much as is produced, ensuring that every train is on time and every trip is safe. Coal mines, steel plants and other units ensure sufficient supply of goods, so that trains are fully loaded, and do everything possible to compress loading and unloading times.

    Before launching the one-dragon competition for steel protection production, transportation, and sales, all relevant units actively took measures to create favorable conditions for the smooth operation of the sixteen trains. The Chongqing Office of the Chengdu Railway Bureau actively improved vehicle scheduling, adjusted the flow of vehicles in a timely manner according to the supply and flow of goods, in order to eliminate the "six waits" (waiting for leaks, waiting for decoupling, waiting for collection, waiting for delivery, waiting for loading, waiting for unloading). Yutianbao Coal Mine plans to actively expand its original coal storage and build a landslide-type coal storage to speed up loading efficiency. Chongqing Iron and Steel Corporation, on the one hand, expanded the stockyard and expanded the cargo space; on the other hand, added hand-held electric shovels, lotus grabs and other machines to further improve the mechanization of unloading. They also launched a heated competition and technical performance competition among the company's transport workers. The employees were enthusiastic and unanimously guaranteed to shorten the unloading time and transport the "grain and grass" to the vicinity of the steelmaking furnace in a timely manner.

    (Reported by our newspaper) After achieving a complete victory in production in May, the staff and workers of the Huainan Coal Mine worked hard and cleverly without stopping, and the output continued to increase sharply at the beginning of June. From the 1st to the 3rd, the coal production plan was completed by 101%, which was 9% higher than the average production level of the previous month. Among them, 47,300 tons of coal were produced on the 1st, setting the highest daily output record of this year.

    In order to realize the continuous leap forward in production, the Huainan Coal Mine convened a meeting of responsible cadres such as the Party Committee Secretaries and mine directors of the nine production mines under its jurisdiction on May 31 to promptly summarize the experience of May and study the main measures for completing the production tasks in June. On the same day, various mines took the method of carrying things through to the end in one go and held general meetings of all employees to fully mobilize the masses to discuss production plans and formulate specific measures for each production unit to complete the plan. The workers put forward the resounding slogan of "Winning in May and fighting again in June, ensuring that June exceeds May," and everyone was full of confidence and enthusiasm, and devoted themselves to the new battle to seize coal. The workers in the third and fourth coal mining districts of Li No. 1 Mine launched a heated production competition from June 1, with everyone racing against time and working closely together in each shift. On the 1st and 2nd, they both overfulfilled the production plan by 180 tons and 188 tons of coal respectively. The workers in the second coal mining district of Xie No. 2 Mine carried out a competition between production teams, and on June 1, they produced more than 200 tons of coal than on May 31.

    Entering June, leading cadres at all levels of the Huainan Coal Mine further went deep into the front line of production, participated in production, led production, and solved many key problems in production. Kang Zhijie, Director of the Huainan Mining Bureau, led more than 20 cadres to Xinzhuangzi Mine on the 2nd to go deep into the site, carefully observe the production situation, and study problems with the workers, which greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the employees and put forward many specific opinions on improving production work. Xinzhuangzi Mine accepted the opinions of Comrade Kang Zhijie to further improve its work, and coal production continued to rise in recent days. The average production level in the first three days was more than 10% higher than the previous month. He Shenfu, the Secretary of the Party Committee of Xie No. 3 Mine, and other leading cadres discovered that the hydraulic coal mining equipment had failed, and immediately directed the repair on the spot. From the 1st to the 3rd, the water mining output increased by 31% compared with the average output of the previous month. (Attached picture)

    重庆冶金、煤炭、交通等部门开展“一条龙”竞赛
    产运销环环协作确保六月多产钢
    淮南煤矿六月旗开得胜创造今年日产量最高纪录
    本报讯　为了进一步加强产、运、销部门之间的协作配合，确保6月份保钢运输任务的胜利完成，最近，重庆市冶金、煤炭、电力、港务、铁路运输部门，开展了联合保钢的产、运、销“一条龙”竞赛。
    重庆市许多煤焦、生铁、矿石等保钢物资都要通过铁路运输，而要加速运输周转，提高运输效率，除了铁路部门本身需要作努力外，还必须煤矿、钢铁厂等产销部门相应地加快装卸时间，使一列火车由装车、运输一直到卸车的各个环节紧密衔接起来。冶金、煤炭、电力、港务、铁路等产、运、销部门的一条龙联合保钢竞赛，是从煤矿到重钢，从铁厂到重钢，从煤矿到重庆发电厂，从煤矿到铁厂等厂矿之间专门组织十六条直达列车，负责运输保钢物资。为了保证上述十六条直达列车顺利开行，成都铁路局重庆办事处保证产多少运多少，作到列列正点，趟趟安全。煤矿、钢铁厂等单位保证货源充足，使火车列列满载，并且千方百计压缩装卸车时间。
    在开展保钢的产、运、销一条龙竞赛之前，各有关单位都积极采取措施，为十六条列车顺利开行创造有利条件。成都铁路局重庆办事处积极改进车辆的调度工作，根据货源货流情况及时调整了车流，以消灭六待（待漏、待解、待取、待送、待装、待卸）。鱼田堡煤矿计划积极扩大原有的煤仓，增建滑坡式煤仓，以加快装车效率。重庆钢铁公司一方面扩大料场，扩大货位；一方面添置手扶电铲、荷花抓斗等机具，进一步提高卸车的机械化程度。他们还在公司的运输工人之间开展了热火朝天的对手赛、技术表演赛，职工们热情高涨，一致保证要缩短卸车时间，把“粮草”及时运送到炼钢炉旁。
    本报讯　淮南煤矿职工继5月份生产满堂红之后，马不停蹄地苦干巧干，6月开头产量继续猛增。1日至3日，完成煤炭生产计划101％，比上月平均生产水平提高9％。其中1日生产煤炭四万七千三百多吨，创今年日产量最高纪录。
    为了实现生产不断跃进，淮南煤矿在5月31日召开所属九个生产矿场党委书记和矿长等负责干部会议，及时地总结5月份经验，研究完成6月份生产任务的主要措施。当天，各个矿场就采取一竿子到底的办法，纷纷召开全体职工大会，充分发动群众讨论生产计划，制订各个生产单位完成计划的具体措施。职工们提出了“5月获胜再战6月，保证6月超5月”的响亮口号，人人信心百倍，干劲冲天，投入新的夺煤大战。李一矿采煤三区和采煤四区工人，自6月1日起开展了热火朝天的生产竞赛，人人争分夺秒，班班密切协作，在1、2两日都分别超额一百八十吨和一百八十八吨煤炭完成了生产计划。谢二矿采煤二区工人以生产小组为单位开展小组与小组竞赛，6月1日比5月31日增产煤炭二百多吨。
    进入6月份，淮南煤矿各级领导干部进一步深入生产第一线，参加生产，领导生产，解决生产中的许多关键问题。淮南矿务局局长康志杰在2日率领二十多名干部，到新庄孜矿深入现场，细致观察生产情况，和工人们一起研究问题，大大地鼓舞了职工的生产干劲，提出了许多改进生产工作的具体意见。新庄孜矿接受康志杰同志的意见进一步改进工作，煤炭产量连日不断上升。头三天的平均生产水平比上月提高10％以上。谢三矿党委书记贺申府等领导干部发现水力采煤设备发生故障，立即在现场指挥检修，1至3日水采产量比上月平均产量还提高31％。（附图片）
