Comrades:

On this day, the tenth anniversary of the U.S. imperialists' armed occupation of our sacred territory of Taiwan, the entire militia of the Lugouqiao People's Commune Militia Division cannot contain the anger in our hearts. Everyone grinds their teeth, hates the U.S. imperialists' acts of aggression, and is determined to work hard to improve production, practice our skills well, and be ready at any time to support the People's Liberation Army, resolutely liberate Taiwan, and defend world peace. We will never give up until we drive the American jackals back to their lair!

U.S. imperialism is the number one enemy of the people of the world and has done nothing but evil for the past ten years. A few days ago, the American gangster chieftain Eisenhower sabotaged the Four-Power Summit and, wearing a false mask of peace, ran to Asia to make trouble, engage in new war conspiracies, and interfere in the internal affairs of Asian countries. He even dared to run to our territory of Taiwan, stepped up preparations for war, and engaged in the "Two Chinas" conspiracy, trying to turn Taiwan into an American colony. We, the emancipated Chinese people, will never agree to these shameless gangster acts, and the peace-loving people of Asia will never agree either. Wherever he runs, the people there will rise up and teach him a lesson, making him get out. We Chinese people are not to be trifled with. If the U.S. imperialists refuse to learn their lesson, we have the strength to beat the invaders until their heads are bloody, just as we did on the Korean battlefield.

Before liberation, the U.S. imperialists colluded with their running dog Chiang Kai-shek, oppressing the Chinese people bitterly. However, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, stood up and tore apart the paper tiger skin of the U.S. imperialists and their running dog Chiang Kai-shek, driving the American devils out of mainland China. For the past ten years, the U.S. imperialists have not given up their ambitions and have continued to occupy Taiwan, making the compatriots in Taiwan live a life worse than that of beasts of burden. We must show the spirit of Wu Song fighting the tiger and resolutely fight to the end for the liberation of the sacred territory of our motherland, Taiwan.

These days, all the militiamen of our militia division have held meetings to denounce the U.S. imperialists, and we are stepping up production, stepping up military training, learning military skills, and raising revolutionary vigilance. We are ready at any time to respond to the call of the motherland and take up arms to eliminate the enemy.

U.S. imperialism is becoming more and more stinking and isolated in the world, and its running dogs are collapsing one after another. The lifespan of imperialism is not long. We are determined to unite with the people of

    时刻准备支援解放台湾
    农民民兵代表李世明同志们：
    在美帝国主义武装侵占我国神圣领土台湾整整十年的今天，我们芦沟桥人民公社民兵师的全体民兵，忍不住心头怒火，人人咬牙切齿，痛恨美帝国主义的侵略行动，决心努力提高生产、练好本领，时刻准备支援解放军，坚决解放台湾，保卫世界和平。不把美国野心狼赶回老窝去，我们绝不罢休！
    美帝国主义是全世界人民的头号敌人，十年来做尽了坏事。前些天，美国强盗头子艾森豪威尔破坏了四国首脑会议，又戴着假和平的鬼脸，跑到亚洲来捣鬼，搞新的战争阴谋，干涉亚洲各国的内政。他还胆敢跑上我国的领土台湾，加紧备战，搞“两个中国”的阴谋，想将台湾变成美国的殖民地。对于这些无耻的强盗行为，我们翻了身的中国人民决不答应，爱好和平的亚洲人民也绝不答应。他跑到那里，那里的人民就起来教训他 ，让他滚蛋。我们中国人民决不是好惹的，美帝国主义者要是再不接受教训，我们有力量像在朝鲜战场上一样，将侵略者打得头破血流。
    解放以前，美帝国主义勾结着它的走狗蒋介石，把中国人民欺侮苦了。可是，我们全中国人民在共产党和毛主席的领导下，站起来了，一把就撕破了美帝国主义和它的走狗蒋介石这些纸老虎的皮，将美国坏蛋赶出中国大陆。十年来，美帝国主义野心不死，一直霸占着台湾，使台湾的同胞过着牛马不如的生活。我们一定要拿出武松打虎的劲头，坚决为解放祖国神圣的领土台湾而奋斗到底。
    这些天，我们民兵师的全体民兵都开了会，痛骂美帝国主义，并且加紧生产，加紧练武，学习军事技能，提高革命警惕。随时准备响应祖国的号召，拿起武器消灭敌人。
    美帝国主义在世界上愈来愈臭，愈来愈孤立，他的走狗们一个接着一个垮了台。帝国主义的寿命不长了。我们坚决同全世界人民一起，结成广泛的统一战线，同帝国主义斗争到底。我们高呼：美帝国主义从台湾滚出去！从南朝鲜滚出去！从日本滚出去！从菲律宾滚出去！从南越滚出去！从西太平洋滚出去！
