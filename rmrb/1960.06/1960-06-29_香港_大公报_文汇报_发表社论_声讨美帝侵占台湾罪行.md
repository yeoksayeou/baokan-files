Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 28th. Hong Kong's "Ta Kung Pao" and "Wen Wei Po" published editorials on the 27th, denouncing the crimes of U.S. imperialism in occupying China's territory of Taiwan for ten years.

　　The "Ta Kung Pao" editorial stated that the fact that the American robbers have been occupying China's territory of Taiwan by armed force for the past ten years shows that U.S. imperialism is the most stubborn enemy of the Chinese people and the most vicious enemy of world peace. The editorial said that for the past ten years, Taiwan has been under the occupation of the U.S. imperialists, like a living hell, with all industries withered, the people living in misery, and the Taiwanese people suffering all kinds of bullying and humiliation. Everyone feels that they would like to see the invaders gone soon. This is a debt of blood owed to the Chinese people by the U.S. imperialists, which will have to be repaid sooner or later. The sea can flow westward, but the Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan will never change.

　　The editorial said that the Chinese people deeply understand the nature of U.S. imperialism and have never had any illusions about it. In the cause of defending peace and opposing aggression, they will unite with all the forces of justice of the people to wage unremitting struggle against U.S. imperialism. The editorial finally paid tribute to the patriotic compatriots in Taiwan and emphasized that the Kuomintang people in Taiwan must now recognize the general trend. If they do not want to be buried with U.S. imperialism, they should change their course and work with the people of the whole country to oppose U.S. imperialism and strive to liberate Taiwan.

　　"Wen Wei Po" wrote in an editorial entitled "Drive Out the U.S. Imperialists and Liberate Taiwan": For the past ten years, the United States has invaded Korea, occupied Taiwan, and continuously carried out military provocations, threatening China's security. U.S. imperialism is the deadly enemy of the Korean and Chinese people. The people of the motherland have repeatedly stated: We must liberate Taiwan and complete the great cause of the reunification of the motherland. The people of the motherland also actively support the patriotic and anti-U.S. struggle in Taiwan, and regard the anti-U.S. demonstration by the people of Taipei three years ago as a glorious record of the anti-U.S. patriotic struggle. We firmly believe that the people of the mainland and the compatriots in Taiwan will never be separated for long, and will eventually unite to resist foreign aggression together.

    香港“大公报”“文汇报”发表社论
    声讨美帝侵占台湾罪行
    新华社香港28日电　香港“大公报”和“文汇报”27日发表社论，声讨美帝国主义侵占我国领土台湾十年的罪行。
    “大公报”的社论说，美国强盗武装侵占我国领土台湾十年来的事实，说明美帝国主义是中国人民最顽固的敌人，也是世界和平最凶恶的敌人。社论说，十年来，台湾在美帝的霸占下，形同炼狱，百业雕敝，民生涂炭，台胞受尽欺凌侮辱，对于侵略者人人都有时日曷丧之感。这是美帝所欠中国人民血债中的一笔，早晚必要清偿。海水可以西流，中国人民解放台湾的决心绝不会改变。
    社论说，中国人民深知美帝的本性，对它向来不存任何幻想。在保卫和平、反对侵略的事业中，将与所有人民正义的力量联合一起，对美帝进行不懈的斗争。社论最后向在台湾的爱国同胞致意，并且强调指出，现在台湾的国民党人更须认清大势，如果不想为美帝殉葬，就应幡然改图，与全国人民一起，为反对美帝和解放台湾而奋起努力。
      “文汇报”在题为“赶走美帝，解放台湾”的社论中写道：十年来，美国侵略朝鲜，侵占台湾，不断进行军事挑衅，威胁我国安全。美帝国主义是朝中人民的死敌。祖国人民已一再申明：一定要解放台湾，完成祖国统一大业。祖国人民也积极支持台湾爱国反美斗争，并把三年前台北人民的反美大示威，看成反美爱国斗争的光荣纪录。我们坚决相信，大陆人民和台湾同胞决不会长期被隔开，而终能团结一致，共御外侮。
