Xinhua News Agency report: Hangzhou Qiantang United Commune Leaving People's Commune cadres go deep into the production team, and after summarizing the "unified leadership, contracted by region, implementation at all levels, the combination of point and surface" working methods, and vigorously led the overall work.

In order to achieve a comprehensive and sustained leap forward in agricultural production this year, Liuxia Commune divided the entire commune into five zones at the beginning of the spring plowing and preparation campaign. The commune's party secretaries led 124 cadres above the brigade level (including business departments) to go deep into the production teams in each zone to participate in production and lead production.

After the implementation of zonal leadership, the commune Party committee promptly put forward the slogan of "to get methods, look downwards; if there are difficulties, consult with the masses," and vigorously promoted the working method of investigation and research, requiring everyone to know everything in their hearts and be decisive in handling affairs. Yu Wenxiao, the secretary of the Commune Party Committee, first investigated the situation of seedling cultivation in the Friendship Production Team, summarized the experience and problems in implementing seedling cultivation and early rice expansion tasks, and wrote the commune's first investigation report. This investigation report was sent to each zone and played a great guiding role in the work at that time. Huang Jinzhang, deputy secretary of the Party committee, was greatly inspired after reading the investigation report. When he was investigating in the Samsung Production Team, he found that the number of mulberry leaf increases could not meet the needs of spring silkworms, so he immediately discussed solutions with the commune members and promoted advanced technologies to accelerate the growth of mulberry leaves. The Samsung Team's investigation was also widely valued by all zones, and a nationwide upsurge in increasing mulberry leaf production was quickly set off throughout the commune. As a result of the leading cadres taking the lead, the atmosphere of investigation and research became very strong throughout the commune.

After the cadres generally went deep into reality and the masses, the new question before the Party committee was how to combine point and surface to make the work of the whole commune leap forward in an all-round way. Zhang Guigen, the deputy secretary of the Party Committee who was in charge of animal husbandry production throughout the commune, in addition to assisting the Wuchang Brigade Party General Branch in strengthening the overall leadership of production, also went deep into the animal husbandry farm of the Jingfeng Production Team, lived, ate, and worked with the breeders, worshiped the breeders as teachers, learned breeding technology, and created a fermentation agent that converts coarse feed into fine feed with the breeders, and realized the automation of washing column water and established a contract-based responsibility system. Then, he promoted the above experience and practices to the entire commune, making the commune's pig production an unprecedented boom.

The Commune Party Committee quickly summarized and promoted Zhang Guigen's working method of "doing a good job in one point and using the point to drive the area."

After Liuxia Commune adopted this working method of going deep into reality, a new atmosphere of "good at participating in production, good at investigation and research, good at solving problems, good at innovation and creation, and good at adhering to learning" emerged among the cadres of the entire commune, becoming an advanced commune in all-round leap forward.

Xinhua News Agency report: Cadres at all levels in Lingbi, Quanjiao, Lu'an, Qingyang, Taihe and other counties in Anhui Province went deep into the production teams, lived and worked with the masses, strengthened the leadership of the front line of production, and greatly accelerated the progress of summer harvesting and planting.

This year, the summer harvesting and planting tasks in Lingbi, Quanjiao, Lu'an, Qingyang and other places are generally larger than in the past, and the quality requirements are higher. In order to seize the season, achieve rapid harvesting and threshing, clean harvesting and threshing, harvesting and planting at the same time, planting enough and planting well, the local county party committees, in addition to making comprehensive arrangements for the summer harvest and planting work, have transferred a large number of cadres to go deep into the production teams to strengthen leadership, so that the summer harvest and planting work in these places has been done quickly and well. Quanjiao County has transferred more than 1,000 cadres at all levels to the brigade and production teams. Among the cadres who went deep into the grassroots labor in Lingbi County, there were 38 secretaries of the county party committee secretariat, county party committee members, and directors and deputy directors. The Lu'an County Party Committee transferred more than 500 cadres directly under the county-level agencies, and together with the commune cadres, formed more than 40 work groups, and determined that the secretaries of party organizations at all levels should personally contract a key commune, team, or field, set an example, and promote the general.

Because cadres at all levels went deep into the front line of production to directly participate in production and lead production, they found problems quickly and solved them in a timely manner. Jiang Zicai, the secretary of the Quanjiao County Party Committee Secretariat, after arriving at the Chenqian Commune, found that the progress of rice planting in this commune was slow, and immediately went deep into the Chenqian Brigade to find out the reason, and held an on-site meeting in this team, so that the daily progress of rice transplanting in the entire commune increased sharply from the original 100 mu to 1,083 mu. Some people in Zheng Guang Brigade, Weiji Commune, Lingbi County, believed that it was still early for the summer harvest and planting time, and there was no need to be busy, so the summer harvest and planting work had not been carried out for a long time. Chen Jiazhen, deputy secretary of the Commune Party Committee, went to this team and found the above problems, and immediately helped the brigade cadres to carry out propaganda and education on quick harvesting and threshing, good harvesting and good planting, so that the number of people participating in the summer harvest and planting every day increased from the original 1,300 to 1,900.

After the cadres at all levels went deep into reality, they found good experiences, quickly summarized and promoted them, and accelerated the progress of summer harvesting and planting.

    深入基层遇事同群众商量
    留下公社干部参加生产，依靠群众，生产出现新气象
    灵璧等县干部跟群众“三同”，夏收夏种又快又好
    据新华社讯　杭州市钱塘联社留下人民公社干部深入到生产队后，摸索出一套“统一领导，分片包干，层层落实，点面结合”的工作方法，有力地领导了全面工作。
    留下公社为了实现今年农业生产的全面持续大跃进，今春在备耕运动初期就将全社划为五个片，公社的党委书记们带领全社大队以上的干部（包括业务部门）一百二十四人，分别深入到各片的生产队去参加生产、领导生产。
    实行分片领导以后，公社党委又及时提出了“要办法，眼睛向下望；有困难，与群众商量”的口号，大力提倡调查研究的工作方法，要求大家做到事事心中有数，办事多谋善断。公社党委书记俞文孝首先在友谊生产队调查了秧苗培育情况，总结出了秧苗培育和早稻扩种任务落实的经验和问题，写出全社第一份调查报告。这份调查报告发到各片后，对当时的工作起了很大的指导作用。党委副书记黄锦章看了调查报告后，受到很大启发。他在三星生产队进行调查时，发现了桑叶增长数不能满足春蚕的需要时，就立即和社员讨论解决问题的办法，并且推广了促使桑叶加速生长的先进技术。三星队的调查，也受到各片普遍重视，全社范围内很快就掀起了增产桑叶的热潮。领导干部带头的结果，全公社作调查研究的风气大盛。
    干部普遍深入实际、深入群众以后，摆在党委面前的新问题，是怎样做到点面结合，使全社工作全面跃进。分工领导全社畜牧生产的党委副书记张桂根，除了协助五常大队党总支加强对生产的全面领导以外，还深入到荆丰生产队畜牧场，与饲养员同吃同住同劳动，拜饲养员为师，学会了饲养技术，并且与饲养员一起创造了一种化粗饲料为精饲料的发酵剂，实现了洗栏水自流化，建立了包工包产责任制。接着，他又向全公社推广了以上经验和做法，使全社生猪生产出现了空前兴旺的景象。
    公社党委迅速总结和推广了张桂根这种“搞好一点，以点带片”的工作方法。
    留下公社在采取这种深入实际的工作方法后，全社干部中出现了“参加生产好，调查研究好，解决问题好，革新创造好，坚持学习好”的新气象，成为全面跃进的先进公社。
    据新华社讯　安徽省灵璧、全椒、六安、青阳、太和等县各级干部深入生产队，和群众同生活同劳动，加强生产第一线的领导，大大加快了夏收夏种进度。
    今年灵璧、全椒、六安、青阳等地的夏收夏种普遍比过去任务大，质量要求高。为了抓住季节，做到快收快打、收净打净、边收边种、种足种好，各地县委除了对夏收夏种工作作了全面安排以外，都抽调大批干部深入生产队，加强领导，使这些地方的夏收夏种工作搞得又快又好。全椒县共抽调了各级干部一千多人下到大队、生产队。灵璧县深入到基层劳动的干部中，有县委书记处书记、县委委员和正、副部长三十八人。六安县委抽调县直属机关干部五百多人，和公社干部一起组成四十多个工作组，并确定各级党组织的书记都要亲自包干一个重点社、队或田块，作出榜样，推动一般。
    由于各级干部深入生产第一线直接参加生产，领导生产，因而发现问题快，解决问题及时。全椒县委书记处书记姜自才到陈浅公社以后，发现这个公社的栽秧进度缓慢，立即深入到陈浅大队找出原因，并在这个队召开现场会，使全社的插秧日进度由原来的一百亩猛增到一千零八十三亩。灵璧县韦集公社郑光大队有些人认为夏收夏种时间还早，用不着忙，因而夏收夏种工作迟迟没有开展起来。公社党委副书记陈家贞下到这个队发现上述问题，立即帮助大队干部开展了快收快打、收好种好的宣传教育，使每天参加夏收夏种的人数由原来的一千三百多人增加到一千九百多人。
    各级干部深入实际以后，发现好的经验，迅速总结推广，还加快了夏收夏种进度。
