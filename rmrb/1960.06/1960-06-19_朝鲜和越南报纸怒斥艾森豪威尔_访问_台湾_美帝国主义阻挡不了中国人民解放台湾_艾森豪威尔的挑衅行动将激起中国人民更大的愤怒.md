Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 18th. "Democratic Korea" published a commentary today, strongly condemning Eisenhower's "visit" to Taiwan and the U.S. imperialist plot to create "two Chinas."

The commentary said that Eisenhower, escorted by the U.S. Seventh Fleet, went to Taiwan to conduct activities, which has aroused the anger of the 650 million Chinese people. Eisenhower stubbornly plunged into the flames of the Chinese people's anger with the aim of challenging the Chinese people and attempting to realize the U.S. imperialist sinister plot to permanently occupy Taiwan. In order to attempt to permanently occupy Taiwan, U.S. imperialism is stubbornly using all means to create the "two Chinas" plot.

The commentary emphasized that Taiwan is an inseparable part of China's territory. The Chinese people's liberation of their own territory, Taiwan, is something that no one can interfere with. This is China's internal affair and the sacred right of the Chinese people. U.S. imperialism must immediately get out of Taiwan. No matter how frantically the U.S. imperialist aggressors act, they cannot stop the great force of the Chinese people who want to liberate Taiwan. If it insists on occupying Taiwan, it will inevitably suffer the due blow from the Chinese people.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 18th. The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published a commentary today emphasizing that Eisenhower's conspiratorial activities on Chinese territory in Taiwan are clearly a blatant provocation against the Chinese people. It will further arouse the anger of the 650 million Chinese people and make them more determined to liberate Taiwan. For the Taiwanese people, who have an anti-American tradition, Eisenhower's activities will certainly "add fuel to the fire" of their anti-American sentiment.

The commentary pointed out that Eisenhower's "visit" to Taiwan is, to be precise, a "visit" by a ringleader who has been caught red-handed and condemned by the people of the world.

The commentary cited Western news pointing out that Eisenhower went to Taiwan to continue the plot to create "two Chinas" in an attempt to permanently occupy China's territory of Taiwan.

The commentary also severely condemned the recent stepped-up provocative activities by the United States in creating tension in the Taiwan Strait.

The commentary said: One of the purposes of Eisenhower's activities in Taiwan, the Philippines, and South Korea is to try to save the prestige of U.S. imperialism and the fate of American running dogs, but the taste Eisenhower has experienced during this "visit" is completely contrary to his wishes.

    朝鲜和越南报纸怒斥艾森豪威尔“访问”台湾
    美帝国主义阻挡不了中国人民解放台湾
    艾森豪威尔的挑衅行动将激起中国人民更大的愤怒
    新华社平壤18日电　“民主朝鲜报”今天发表评论，严厉谴责艾森豪威尔“访问”台湾，谴责美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋。
    评论说，艾森豪威尔由美国的第七舰队“保驾”到台湾活动，已经激起了六亿五千万中国人民的愤怒。艾森豪威尔硬着头皮跳进中国人民的愤怒的火焰中的目的是：向中国人民挑战，企图实现美帝国主义永远霸占台湾的罪恶阴谋。美帝国主义为了企图永久霸占台湾，正顽固地用一切手段制造“两个中国”的阴谋。
    评论强调说，台湾是中国不可分割的领土。中国人民解放自己的领土台湾，是任何人也不能干涉的。这是中国内政问题，是中国人民的神圣的权利。美帝国主义必须立即从台湾滚出去。无论美帝国主义侵略者怎样疯狂，也阻挡不了中国人民要解放台湾的伟大力量。如果它坚持霸占台湾，就必将遭到中国人民给予的应有的打击。
    新华社河内18日电　越南“人民报”今天发表评论强调指出，艾森豪威尔到中国领土台湾进行阴谋活动，显然是对中国人民的明目张胆的挑衅。它将更加激起六亿五千万中国人民的愤怒，使他们更加坚决地要解放台湾。对于具有反美传统的台湾人民说来，艾森豪威尔的活动一定会使他们的反美情绪“火上添油”。
    评论指出，艾森豪威尔到台湾的“访问”，确切地说，是一个被抓到赃证和受到全世界人民谴责的一个匪首的“访问”。
    评论援引西方消息指出，艾森豪威尔到台湾去，是为了继续制造“两个中国”的阴谋，妄图永远占领中国的领土台湾。
    评论还严厉谴责最近美国加紧进行挑衅活动，在台湾海峡制造紧张局势。
    评论说：艾森豪威尔到台湾、菲律宾和南朝鲜等地活动的目的之一，是企图挽救美帝国主义的威信、挽救美国走狗的命运，但是艾森豪威尔这次“访问”所尝到的味道，完全同他的愿望相反。（附图片）
    6月17日，平壤三十万人举行大会和示威游行，强烈反对和谴责艾森豪威尔到南朝鲜进行阴谋活动。
