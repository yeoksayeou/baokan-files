Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 2nd: On the eve of the Japanese working class's general strike on June 4th, every corner of Tokyo is filled with an active atmosphere of struggle. Calls for support of the strike and signature-gathering campaigns are intertwined, and people are fighting for the victory of the general strike.

Every day, Tokyo's various trade unions send propaganda teams to train stations and major subway stations to distribute leaflets to travelers, calling for support for the general strike.

The leaflets distributed by the National Railway Workers' Union ("Kokutetsu") propaganda team read: On June 4th, National Railway vehicles will be out of service. The time has come for all the people to take action to force the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet, which is trampling on democracy, to resign, to force the dissolution of the Diet, and to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty." Please understand and support our struggle.

The central offices of each union have dispatched staff to various factories to carry out propaganda and organizational work. Activists in various factories are responding to the instructions of the union central office, stepping up the establishment of a strike system, and preparing to meet the June 4th general strike.

Five hundred workers from the Tokyo "Kokutetsu" Union and the Locomotive Engineers' Union held a general mobilization meeting in Shinagawa Ward yesterday, resolutely expressing their determination to fight for the complete victory of the June 4th general strike.

Former Tokyo Metropolitan University Professor Yoshimi Takeuchi went to Chiba City to participate in the "Kokutetsu" workers' conference and spoke at the meeting in support of the "Kokutetsu" workers' struggle.

The union of Kyodo Printing, one of Japan's largest printing factories, distributed 10,000 copies of a special issue of the union's newspaper to its workers and workers in nearby small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as to citizens, to publicize the importance of the June 4th strike.

Activists from the "Nippon Kokan" Kawasaki Steel Works union recently automatically collected 5,000 signatures on the street against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." Shigeru Sakata, an executive committee member of the union, pointed out that the workers' political consciousness is constantly improving, and the workers of the Kawasaki Steel Works are closely united. He believes that the June 4th general strike will surely be victorious.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 2nd: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), Japan's largest trade union, issued a statement today announcing that Japanese workers will hold a general strike on June 4th as originally planned, regardless of the Kishi Nobusuke government's suppression.

Before the "Sohyo" issued its statement, the Kishi Nobusuke government issued a statement expressing its intention to suppress the general strike to be held by Japanese workers on June 4th. The statement said that the strike by Japanese workers against the ratification of the aggressive Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, demanding the resignation of the reactionary Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet "exceeds the scope of the right to collective action guaranteed by the Constitution" and is an "illegal collective action." After the release of this statement, Chief Cabinet Secretary Etsusaburo Shiina, Finance Minister Hayato Ikeda, Postal Minister Haruhiko Uetake, and Japanese National Railways President Shinji Sogō of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet issued "warnings" to civil servants in their respective departments, clamoring for "severe punishment" for workers participating in the general strike.

In its statement, "Sohyo" refuted the Kishi Nobusuke government's attack on the general strike. The statement said that it is the right of workers to express their will on national policy through strikes. The statement emphasized that when the Diet is on the verge of destruction under the tyrannical behavior of the ruling party, the people have an obligation to protest. The statement indicated that workers will hold a general strike according to the original plan.

The statement also demanded the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, the dissolution of the Diet, and opposition to the ratification of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The statement called on all Japanese people to understand the dangerous nature of the current situation and to fully support the workers who are holding a protest strike.

The Japan Socialist Party also issued a statement today pointing out that the workers' strike scheduled for June 4th is an exercise of workers' legitimate rights. The statement said:
	"The workers' resolute action will demonstrate the people's anger at the shameless Kishi Nobusuke."

The statement called on all the people to express their support for the planned strike.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 2nd: The Presidium of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued an appeal today regarding the nationwide general strike scheduled for June 4th, calling on all Japanese people to take resolute action on the upcoming general strike day to support striking workers in various forms. A special edition of the "Akahata" (Red Flag) newspaper, which contained this appeal, has been widely distributed at Tokyo train stations, streets, and rallies.

In this appeal, the Japanese Communist Party demanded: "Declare invalid the Diet's decisions on the new Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty' and the extension of the Diet session! The Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet must resign collectively now! Organize a provisional cabinet to be responsible for the general election! Dissolve the Diet immediately! Eisenhower, do not come to Japan!"

The appeal said, "The above are the demands put forward by the vast majority of the Japanese people. If we are to save the Japanese nation from the brink of destruction, it is right to make the above demands."

The appeal said, "In order to realize these demands, the Japanese people are preparing to take large-scale action centered on the workers' powerful strike on June 4th. The working class is now taking the most militant and powerful action - a nationwide strike - in order to save the Japanese nation. It is their legitimate right to do so."

The appeal said, "However, the Kishi Nobusuke clique stubbornly insists on preventing the powerful expression of public anger, claiming that the workers' planned strike is illegal and threatening to suppress the workers. If the Kishi Nobusuke clique dares to take suppressive measures against the striking workers, the Japanese people will resolutely rise up and deal them a fatal blow."

The appeal said, "The days when Kishi Nobusuke is in power can be counted on one's fingers. It is only a matter of time before Kishi Nobusuke is overthrown. Just like Syngman Rhee in South Korea and Adnan Menderes in Turkey were overthrown."

The appeal called: "Let all workers participate in the scheduled strike! Let us organize a great unified movement against the 'Security Treaty' on June 4th, including all the Japanese people! Let us repel all attacks and suppression by the government and the police! All communists should stand at the forefront of this great struggle!"

    总评宣布不顾政府镇压如期举行罢工　日共号召人民全力支持罢工
    据新华社2日讯　东京消息：在日本工人阶级6月4日举行总罢工前夕，东京的各个角落充满着活跃的斗争气氛，支持罢工的呼声和征集签名运动交织在一起，人们在为总罢工的胜利而奋斗。
    东京各个工会每天都派出宣传队到火车站和地下铁道主要车站去向旅客散发传单，呼吁支持总罢工。
    国营铁道工会（“国铁”）宣传队散发的传单上面写着：6月4日国营铁道的车辆将停驶，全体人民行动起来迫使蹂躏民主的岸信介内阁辞职、迫使解散国会和阻止批准新“安全条约”的时候已经到来，请各位理解和支持我们的斗争。
    各工会中央都分别派遣工作人员到各个工厂去进行宣传和组织工作。各工厂的积极分子正在响应工会中央的指令，加紧建立罢工体系，准备迎接六·四总罢工。
    东京“国铁”工会和动力车工会的五百名工人昨天在品川区举行总奋起大会，坚决表示要为争取六·四总罢工彻底胜利而奋斗。
    前东京都立大学教授竹内好到千叶市参加了“国铁”工人的大会，并且在会上讲话声援“国铁”工人的斗争。
    日本最大印刷厂之一的共同印刷厂的工会向所属工人和附近中小企业工人以及市民散发了一万份工会机关报专刊，宣传六·四罢工的重要意义。
    “日本钢管”川崎制铁厂工会的积极分子们最近自动到街上征集了五千名反对新日美“安全条约”的签名。这个工会的执行委员坂田茂指出，工人的政治觉悟不断提高，川崎制铁厂的工人紧紧地团结起来了。他相信六·四总罢工必将取得胜利。
    新华社2日讯　东京消息：日本最大的工会日本工会总评议会今天发表声明，宣布日本工人将不顾岸信介政府的镇压，将按照原定计划在6月4日举行总罢工。
    在“总评”发表声明以前，岸信介政府曾经发表声明，表示要镇压日本工人将在6月4日举行的总罢工。声明说什么日本工人反对批准侵略性日美军事同盟条约，要求岸信介反动内阁总辞职、解散国会的罢工“是超越了宪法所保障的团体行动权的范围的”，是“违法的集体行动”。在这个声明发表以后，岸信介内阁的官房长官椎名悦三郎、大藏相池田勇人、邮政相植竹春彦、日本国营铁道总裁十河信二等分别向他们所属的部门的公务人员发出“警告”，叫嚷要对参加总罢工的工人给予“严重处分”。
    “总评”在声明中驳斥了岸信介政府对总罢工的攻击。声明说，通过罢工来表示他们对国家政策的意志，是工人的权利。声明强调说，当国会在执政党的横暴行为下处在毁灭的边缘时，人民有义务提出抗议。声明表示，工人将按照原定方针，举行总罢工。
    声明并且要求岸信介内阁下台、解散国会，反对批准新日美“安全条约”。
    声明要求所有的日本人民理解目前局势的危急性，并且全力支持举行抗议罢工的工人。
    日本社会党今天也发表声明指出，定于6月4日举行的工人罢工是行使工人的合法权利。声明说：
  “工人的坚决行动将表现出人民对厚颜无耻的岸信介的愤怒。”
    声明要求所有的人民表示他们支持预定的罢工。
    新华社2日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会干部会今天就定于6月4日举行全国总罢工发出呼吁书，号召全体日本人民在即将到来的总罢工日采取坚决行动以各种形式支持罢工工人。刊登有这份呼吁书的“赤旗报”特刊已在东京火车站、街道和集会上普遍散发。
    日本共产党在这一呼吁书中要求：“宣布国会就新日美‘安全条约’以及延长国会会期作出的决定无效！岸信介内阁现在集体辞职！组织临时内阁来负责大选事宜！立刻解散国会！艾森豪威尔，不要到日本来！”
    呼吁书说，“以上各项，是绝大多数日本人民提出的要求。如果要把日本民族从毁灭的边缘上拯救出来，提出上述要求是正确的。”
    呼吁书说，“为了实现这些要求，日本人民正在准备于6月4日采取大规模的以工人的强有力的罢工为中心的行动。工人阶级现在正在采取最具有战斗性的有力行动——全国范围的罢工，以便拯救日本民族。工人们这样做，是他们的正当权利。”
    呼吁书说，“可是，岸信介集团顽固地执意要阻止公众愤怒的强有力的表示，硬说工人预定举行的罢工是非法的，并威胁说要对工人进行镇压。如果岸信介集团竟然对罢工工人采取镇压措施，日本人民将坚决奋起给予他们以致命的打击。”
    呼吁书说，“岸信介当权的日子已经屈指可数了。岸信介被推翻，只是时间问题。正如南朝鲜的李承晚和土耳其的曼德列斯被推翻一样。”
    呼吁书号召说，“让全体工人都参加预定举行的罢工！让我们在6月4日组织包括全体日本人民在内的伟大的反对‘安全条约’的统一运动！让我们击退政府和警察的一切进攻和镇压！全体共产党员应当在这个伟大的斗争中站在最前列！”
