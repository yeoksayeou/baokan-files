Upholding the Theory of Integrating Workers, Peasants, and Students
Hu Yimei, Secretary of the CPC Xiangyin County Miluo Commune Committee

    As early as the spring of 1958, many of our comrades felt that we must intensify our theoretical study to improve our leadership level and working methods to meet the requirements of the Great Leap Forward in production. It happened that at this time, the cadres of Heping Small Cooperative (now the production team) only focused on accumulating manure and kept the spring plowing cattle in the pens without working. Comrade Zhu Xianle, a member of the Miluo Township Party Committee, asked them, "Spring cattle are like warhorses, why are they kept in the pens?" The cooperative cadres said, "The Township Party Committee has instructed us to vigorously accumulate manure!" Comrade Yang Jingguo, the original Secretary of the Township Party Committee, seized on this matter and gave a lesson to all the cadres, explaining the principle of grasping both the main contradiction and the secondary contradictions, and having both principle and flexibility in their work. The cadres responded well, believing that this kind of study solved problems. From then on, a mass movement to study Marxism-Leninism and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong was widely and deeply launched in our Miluo Commune. Up to now, the number of participants in the study accounts for 85% of the adult population. Party schools, Communist Youth League schools, and Red and Expert schools have been continuously expanded and increased, especially the "Report Meetings on Studying Mao Zedong Thought," "Mao Zedong Works Study Groups," and "Lectures on Mao Zedong Works," which have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain. The whole commune presents a new atmosphere of "carrying books with you, classrooms everywhere, giving lectures at every meeting, discussing theory in everything, everyone learning theory, everyone writing articles." Since 1958, political theory books, especially Chairman Mao's works, have become sought-after reading materials, with the Miluo Xinhua Bookstore selling more than 38,000 copies. In the past two years, cadres have written more than 160 articles in newspapers and magazines, and have also compiled and printed six booklets such as "Miluo People Studying Theory," "Selected Philosophical Poems," "Collection of Farmers' Essays," and "Workers and Peasants Talking About Philosophy."

    The Vast Number of Cadres and Commune Members Have Gained a Great Deal from Studying Theory

    The vast number of cadres and commune members have gained a great deal through two years of theoretical study. First of all, the cadres have improved their working methods and style, greatly improved their policy level, and mastered the working methods of the mass line. More than 95% of the cadres in our commune are from peasant backgrounds. Although they have a high degree of class consciousness, great enthusiasm, and abundant revolutionary zeal, their working style was relatively simple and rigid, and they were not good at making scientific analysis and following the mass line because of their low theoretical level. Since adhering to the study of theory, they have generally learned to grasp the main contradictions in their work, "pulling the ox by the nose." They have learned to "walk on two legs," grasping both production and life, both central work and departmental work, and overcoming the style of working in isolation. In particular, they have mastered the working methods of the mass line, consulting with the masses on everything, explaining the reasons, persuading and educating, raising the consciousness of the masses, and turning the Party's various policies into the conscious actions of the masses. Originally, eleven of the forty-five cadres in the commune had a style of coercion and command, but now they have all corrected it. For example, He Xinbi, the Secretary of the General Branch of the Sanhe Brigade, was previously described by the masses in a jingle: "He Xinbi, doesn't study, three baskets of cow dung and six dustpans, unreasonable and domineering, coercion and command is his priority." Some farmers would turn up their noses when they saw him coming. Now He Xinbi has changed, chatting and laughing with the masses like one family. The masses have given him another jingle: "He Xinbi, loves to study, analyzes and reasons in everything, hard-working and takes the lead, connecting with the masses is his priority."

    Secondly, the knowledge of the laws of social development and class struggle has armed the cadres and the masses, so that in the sharp and complex class struggle in the countryside, they can distinguish right from wrong, stand firm, and resolutely support the Party's policies. During the communization in 1958, we had just built the framework of the People's Commune, and a few people had doubts about why we should run People's Communes. After studying the theory that "the relations of production must be adapted to the nature of the development of the productive forces," these people's doubts were dispelled, and they realized that in the situation of the Great Leap Forward in production, the productive forces were developing forward, which required further improvement of the relations of production, which was an inevitable trend of social development. For example, Yu Fake, a commune member of the Baizhang Brigade, originally thought that "People's Communes are good, but it's not bad to run advanced cooperatives for a few more years," but at this time he suddenly realized that "Everything is like climbing stairs, rising step by step. It turns out that running communes is also like bamboo shoots growing; it doesn't happen until the time is right!" In the second half of 1959, through the study of the theory of class struggle during the period of socialist construction, the class consciousness of the broad masses was further enhanced, and many people were able to stand on the correct position and launch a struggle against right-leaning ideas. For example, Yang Guitang, the head of the work group of the Guiyi Brigade, said: "I originally thought there was no class struggle, and I almost got fooled; after studying this lesson, I realized that the exploiting class was just playing the turtle trick, shrinking its head on weekdays, and poking its head and stirring up trouble at the slightest disturbance." Yang Qitao, the captain of the Menlou Production Team, overcame his right-leaning ideas after studying, and reported the crimes of unlawful landlords Yang Mengcheng and Yang Zilian in destroying public canteens and collective pig-raising undertakings, and used these facts to educate the commune members, arousing the class hatred of the broad masses. At the same time, the broad masses of commune members also clarified that criticizing the capitalist ideas represented by a few wealthy middle peasants in the countryside is a continuation of the struggle between the two roads. The commune members of the Outang Production Team voluntarily exposed the fact that the wealthy middle peasant Yang Liulian stole public property, and seized on this matter to conduct a great debate, enabling the masses to distinguish between right and wrong and raise their socialist consciousness.

    Thirdly, it broke superstitions, liberated minds, and further brought into play people's subjective initiative. The water conservancy conditions in the whole commune were originally very poor. In the past, there was a saying that "Seven flats and six embankments, three days of drizzle and flooding, three days of sunshine and drought." Under the brilliant light of the general line, the broad masses of commune members studied materialist dialectics, criticized the theory of sole reliance on conditions, and realized that under certain conditions, contradictions can be transformed, no water can be transformed into water, and water disasters can be transformed into water conservancy. As long as people's subjective initiative is brought into play, we can transform nature and win a bumper harvest. This liberated people from the fatalistic view of "three points rely on people, seven points rely on heaven." In the large-scale water conservancy construction movement, everyone's enthusiasm soared. In the past two years, the Red Flag Reservoir and the Miluo Reservoir were built, and the whole commune achieved water conservancy, ensuring a great agricultural harvest. In 1958, the average rice yield per mu increased by 24.9% compared to 1957. In 1959, although there was an unprecedented drought, the average rice yield per mu still increased by 7.6% compared to 1958. For example, Zheng Lizhou, the Secretary of the General Branch of the Jiacheng Brigade, always believed in the past that the work foundation of the Jiacheng Brigade was not good and the natural conditions were very poor. He said, "Don't marry a daughter to the Bai Mu Du (location of the brigade), two mouths of earthen bricks to support a pot. If it doesn't rain for three days, don't expect rice in the pot for a year." Therefore, he was always very distressed in his work. But after studying the lesson of "catching up from behind," he understood that difficulties are temporary, conditions can be changed, and as long as we work hard, "the backward can become advanced, and the poor team can become rich." During last year's severe drought, he resolutely implemented the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, fully mobilized the masses, organized more than 200 laborers to draw water from the river, connected with water pumps, and finally overcame the drought demon, ensuring a great agricultural harvest, an increase of 18.2% compared to the Great Leap Forward in 1958. In addition, the broad masses of commune members, through studying the Party's general line for building socialism and Chairman Mao's philosophical thought, understood that building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results is the correct policy, established a style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, and played a very important role in promoting the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the whole commune.

    It is particularly worth mentioning that most of the commune members in our commune used to have a relatively strong belief in gods and ghosts. For example, in the Miluo area, many people believed in the so-called "Four Great Grandfathers" (four great gods). However, after the commune members studied materialism and launched a great debate between atheism and theism, many people have understood from theory and fact that the world is material and that gods and ghosts do not exist, thus breaking down superstitious beliefs. For example, Yang Ximei, a woman from the Baizhang Brigade, did not dare to go out to meetings at night in the past because she believed in gods and ghosts. After studying, she released the shackles on her spirit and actively attended meetings. Someone sent her a jingle: "Yang Ximei from the Baizhang Brigade, she's afraid of ghosts when attending meetings at night, if you force her to attend, she frowns and pouts. Since studying materialism, she never refuses to attend every meeting, someone asks her if she's still afraid? She says there are no gods and ghosts in the world." Now she has become an active advocate of atheism.

    In short, the study of theory by workers and peasants has far-reaching significance for transforming both the subjective and objective world. After studying theory, the cadres and commune members of the Baizhang Brigade came to the conclusion: "Theory is a treasure, everyone needs it, learning it can enlighten you, and production will be booming."

    A Few Experiences in Organizing and Upholding the Study of Theory by Workers and Peasants

    The Party committee's active leadership and adherence to the struggle between two roads and two kinds of understanding in the study movement is an important experience in organizing workers and peasants to study theory well. The commune Party committee has always attached importance to the work of studying theory and resolutely struggled against various erroneous ideas that hindered the development of the movement. At the beginning of the movement, the first question we encountered was whether workers and peasants should study theory. Most people thought they should. However, some comrades did not realize the benefits of studying theory for work and production, and thought that it didn't matter whether they studied or not, as long as they did their work well; they were too busy with work to study. In response to these one-sided understandings, the commune Party committee organized everyone to debate, making them realize that "without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary movement," and criticizing the empiricist view that "work can be done well even without studying." In the debate, a large number of facts were cited to illustrate that the working people should not only study theory, but also be able to study theory well, breaking down the mysterious concepts of theory held by many cadres and the masses.

    After the questions of whether they should study and whether they could study were resolved, the question of how to study arose. There were also two different opinions at the beginning. Most people believed that theoretical study should serve politics, serve production, and solve practical problems in work, production, and thought. However, some people advocated studying the book systematically from beginning to end, and did not agree with studying according to the needs of actual work. They one-sidedly saw the difference between study and work, but did not see the unity between the two, mistakenly believing that "to study is not to work, to work is not to study." The Party committee resolutely supported the views of the majority, adopted the method of focusing on practical problems, discussing theory based on practice, and combining the practical and the theoretical, closely coordinating with the needs of political movements and production movements, arranging study content, and combining situation and task lessons with basic lessons and theoretical lessons, so as to achieve the goal of integrating learning and application. For example, when establishing the People's Commune, we organized the masses and cadres to study the resolution of the Party Central Committee on establishing People's Communes in rural areas, study the theory that "the relations of production must be adapted to the nature of the development of the productive forces," and study dialectics. In the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, we organized the masses to study the importance of implementing the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture and its dialectical relationship, and, in accordance with the philosophical principles of grasping the main contradiction and the interrelationship of things, we spoke extensively about the status of agriculture in the national economy and the great significance of taking grain as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward. In 1959, when our commune suffered an unprecedented severe drought, we organized the masses to study the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and other documents, speaking extensively on the principles of "bringing into play people's subjective initiative" and "planning is up to people, success is up to people," and criticizing the cowardly and lazy worldview of "three points rely on people, seven points rely on heaven." In the winter of 1959, in coordination with the rectification movement, we organized the study of class struggle during the period of socialist construction, the "three long lives," the struggle between the two worldviews, and the correct distinction between the main stream and the tributaries, phenomena and essence, and other issues. This spring, in conjunction with the discussion and formulation of the annual production plan, we organized the study of the lesson on "the relationship between high speed and proportion." Because the policy of combining theory with practice was implemented from beginning to end, and the problems in actual work were raised to the theoretical level for analysis, and revolutionary theory was used to guide practice, the study achieved a "immediate results," and work and study promoted and promoted each other, so that the theoretical study of workers and peasants could be sustained.

    In our work of organizing workers and peasants to study theory, there is another important experience, that is, to do this work well, we must adhere to carrying out mass movements on a large scale. In this regard, we have handled the following issues in this way:

    1. The issue of popularization and improvement: To carry out a mass movement of studying theory, the first thing to do is to popularize it. At the beginning, we did it among grassroots cadres, and also among some peasant activists. These people have a higher enthusiasm for learning and a stronger ability to accept. Later, they all became the core force of the mass movement of workers and peasants studying theory. When their enthusiasm came, their interest in learning became strong, and further popularization became possible. When the study movement has been going on among these people for a period of time, on the one hand, we carry out the consolidation and improvement work of this group of people studying theory, inserting red flags and establishing pacesetters among them; on the other hand, we actively carry out popularization, expanding the objects of studying theory to Party and Communist Youth League members and activists, and also among the general public. In this way, the mass movement of studying theory has continued to develop forward, negating the idea of trying to fix the study of theory by workers and peasants forever within the scope of grassroots cadres.

    2. Combining key improvement with general improvement. At the beginning of the movement, we focused on improving the comrades of the commune Party committee and the commune cadres, and then further expanded the core force, making all Party and Communist Youth League members the key objects of improvement. We have taken some specific measures, such as establishing a philosophy research institute, running Party and Communist Youth League schools, and holding training courses for activists, which play a great role in cultivating and improving key personnel.

    3. Organizing the teaching force and solving the problem of teaching strength: We have adhered to the method of the mass line, and adopted a combination of "native and foreign," a combination of full-time and part-time, and a combination of middle and primary school teachers and farmer teachers. There have also been two views on the question of "who will teach." One is to advocate the "expert" route, hoping that full-time theory instructors will be sent from above; the other is to advocate the mass line, that is, to train a large number of part-time theory instructors from the masses and cadres. We have adhered to the latter route, and unanimously believe that for workers and peasants to study theory, it is certainly necessary for full-time theory instructors to undertake teaching tasks, but the important thing is to rely on part-time theory instructors and the broad masses of cadres. Because part-time theory instructors and the cadres in the commune have practical work experience and are familiar with the current local situation, as long as they are given assistance, they can give lectures and give the lectures very well. Starting from this understanding, the Party committee studied and taught at the same time, taking the lead in giving lectures. Under the influence of the Party committee, the secretaries of the general branches of the major brigades, the secretaries of the production team branches, and Party and Communist Youth League members, activists, etc., have also begun to give theory lessons. In the past two years, the whole commune has trained a team of more than 800 workers and peasants who are engaged in theoretical work. They are a strong leading force for further developing the study of theory by workers and peasants.

    坚持工农学理论的群众运动
    中共湘阴县汨罗公社委员会书记　胡逸梅
    早在1958年春天，我们的很多同志就感觉到必须加紧学习理论，以提高领导水平和改进工作方法，适应生产大跃进的要求。恰好在这个时候发生了和平小社（现在的生产队）的干部只抓积肥，把春牛关在栏里不出工的事，汨罗乡党委委员朱先乐同志问他们：“春牛如战马，为什么把牛关在栏里呢？”社干部说：“乡党委布置要大搞积肥呀！”原乡党委书记阳敬国同志就抓住这件事，向全体干部上了一课，讲了在工作中既要抓主要矛盾，又要抓次要矛盾，既要有原则性，又要有灵活性的道理。干部听了，反映很好，认为这样的学习很解决问题。从这以后，一个学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛泽东同志的著作的群众运动，便在我们汨罗公社广泛深入地开展了起来。到现在为止，参加学习的人数占成年人的85％。党校、团校、红专学校，不断扩大和增加，特别是“学习毛泽东思想的报告会”、“毛泽东著作学习小组”、“毛泽东著作讲座”，有如雨后春笋般地建立起来了。全社呈现出“书本随身带，到处是课堂，逢会便讲课，遇事都论虚，大家学理论，大家写文章”的新气象。从1958年以来，政治理论书籍，特别是毛主席的著作，已成为争购的读物，汨罗新华书店已销售三万八千多册。两年来，干部在报纸杂志上写的文章有一百六十多篇，还先后编印过“汨罗人民学理论”、“哲学诗歌选”、“农民论文选集”、“工农谈哲学”等六种小册子。
    广大干部和社员学习理论的收获很大
    广大干部和社员经过两年来的理论学习，收获很大。首先是干部改进了工作方法和工作作风，大大提高了政策水平，掌握了群众路线的工作方法。我们全社95％以上的干部都是农民出身，虽然阶级觉悟很高，干劲很大，有充沛的革命热情，但由于理论水平较低，因而工作作风比较简单生硬，遇事不善于作科学分析和走群众路线。自从坚持学理论以来，一般学会了在工作中抓主要矛盾，“牵牛要牵牛鼻子”。学会了“两条腿走路”，既抓生产、又抓生活，既抓中心工作、又抓部门工作，克服了单打一的作风。特别是掌握了群众路线的工作方法，遇事和群众商量，讲道理，说服教育，提高群众觉悟，把党的各项政策变为群众的自觉行动。原来公社四十五个干部中有十一个人存在着强迫命令作风，现在都改正过来了。如三和大队总支书记何新毕，过去群众给他送了一首快板说：“何新毕，不学习，三担牛屎六簸箕，遇事霸蛮不讲理，强迫命令他第一。”有些农民看到他来了，就把嘴巴翘起来。现在何新华变了，和群众有说有笑，亲如一家人。群众又给他送了一首快板：“何新毕，爱学习，遇事分析讲道理，又艰苦、又带头，联系群众他第一。”
    其次是用社会发展的规律和阶级斗争的知识武装了干部和群众，因而在农村尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，他们能够明辨是非，站稳立场，坚决拥护党的方针政策。1958年公社化时，我们刚刚搭起人民公社的架子，有少数人对为什么要办人民公社有怀疑。经过学习“生产关系一定要适合生产力发展的性质”的理论以后，这些人的怀疑解除了，他们认识到在生产大跃进的形势下，由于生产力向前发展了，就要求进一步改善生产关系，这是社会发展的必然趋势。如百丈大队社员喻发科，原来认为“人民公社好是好，但再办几年高级社也不差”，而这时他恍然大悟了，说：“一切事情像上楼梯一样，步步高升。原来办公社也像楠竹生笋一样，不到时候还不生哩！”1959年下半年，通过学习社会主义建设时期的阶级斗争的理论，又进一步提高了广大群众的阶级觉悟，许多人都能站在正确的立场上，同右倾思想展开斗争。如归义大队作业组长杨桂堂说：“原来认为没有阶级斗争了，差点儿上了当；学了这课，我才懂得剥削阶级只不过是耍了乌龟法，平日缩着头，一有风吹草动，便探头探脑，兴风作浪。”门楼生产队队长杨其桃，学习后克服了右倾思想，检举了不法地主杨盂成、杨子连破坏公共食堂和集体养猪事业的罪行，并运用这些事实向社员进行了教育，激发了广大社员的阶级仇恨。同时，广大社员也明确了农村中批判以少数富裕中农为代表的资本主义思想，是两条道路斗争的继续。藕塘生产队的社员就自动地揭发了富裕中农杨六连盗窃公共财产的事实，并且抓住这件事进行了一场大辩论，使群众分清了大是大非，提高了社会主义觉悟。
    第三是破除了迷信，解放了思想，进一步发挥了人们的主观能动作用。全社原来水利条件很差，过去有所谓“七坪六垸，三天麻雨遭淹，三天太阳遭干”的说法。在总路线的光辉照耀下，广大社员学习了唯物辩证法，批判了唯条件论，认识到在一定条件下，矛盾是可能转化的，无水能变有水，水害能变水利，只要发挥人的主观能动性，就能改造大自然，夺得大丰收。这样就把人们从“三分靠人、七分靠天”的宿命论的观点下解放出来了。在大修水利运动中，人人干劲冲天，两年来修建了红旗水库、汨罗水库，全社实现了水利化，保证了农业大丰收。1958年稻谷平均亩产比1957年增加24．9％，1959年虽然遭了历史上从未有过的特大干旱，但是，稻谷平均亩产仍比1958年增加7．6％。如夹城大队总支书记郑力舟，过去总认为夹城大队工作基础不好，自然条件很差，说什么“有女莫嫁百亩圫（大队所在地），两口土砖架口锅，若是三天不下雨，一年莫想米下锅”，因而他在工作中一直很苦恼。但是在学了“后来居上”一课以后，懂得了困难是暂时的，条件是可以改变的，只要积极努力，“后进可以变先进，穷队可以变富队”。在去年特大干旱中，他坚决地贯彻了党的八届八中全会的精神，充分发动群众，组织两百多劳力下河车水，与抽水机连成一气，终于战胜了旱魔，保证了农业大丰收，比大跃进的1958年还增产18．2％。另外，广大社员通过学习党的建设社会主义总路线和毛主席的哲学思想，懂得了多快好省是建设社会主义的正确方针，树立了敢想、敢说、敢干的风格，对推动全社的技术革新和技术革命运动，起了很重要的促进作用。
    特别值得提出的是，我们公社的大部分社员过去有比较浓厚的神鬼观念，如汨罗地区就有不少人相信所谓“四大爹爹”（四大神），但在社员学习了唯物论，开展了无神论与有神论的大辩论之后，已经有许多人从理论上和事实上懂得了世界是物质的，神鬼是不存在的道理，因而破除了神鬼迷信。如百丈大队妇女杨细美过去由于迷信神鬼，晚上不敢出门开会。经过学习以后，她解除了精神上的枷锁，积极地到会了。有人给她送了一首快板说：“百丈队杨细美，晚上开会她怕鬼，若是硬要她到会，愁眉苦脸又翘嘴。自从学习唯物论，每次开会不辞退，有人问她还怕不？她说世上无神鬼。”现在她变成了宣传无神论的积极分子。
    总之，工农群众学习理论，不论对改造主观世界和客观世界，都有着深远的意义。百丈大队干部和社员经过学习理论，得出了这样一个结论：“理论是个宝，人人少不了，学了能开窍，生产呱呱叫。”
          组织和坚持工农群众学理论的几点体会
    党委积极领导，在学习运动中坚持两条道路、两种认识的斗争，是组织工农群众学好理论的一条重要经验。公社党委一贯重视学习理论的工作，坚决地向各种阻挠运动开展的错误思想进行斗争。运动一开头，我们碰到的第一个问题，就是工农群众要不要学理论？大部分人认为应该学。但是也有一部分同志由于没有认识到学理论究竟对工作、生产有什么好处，认为学不学没关系，干好工作就行；现在工作很忙，没有时间学。公社党委针对这些片面的认识，组织大家进行了辩论，使大家认识到“没有革命的理论，就没有革命的运动”，批判了“不学习也能搞好工作”的经验主义的看法。在辩论中，还列举大量事实，说明了工农劳动人民不但应该学理论，而且能够学好理论，破除了不少干部和群众对于理论的神秘观念。
    应该学和能够学的问题解决以后，又发生了怎样学的问题。开始时也有两种不同意见。大多数人认为，理论学习应该为政治服务、为生产服务，解决工作上、生产上、思想上的实际问题。但是，有的人却主张按书本的系统从头至尾顺序地学，不赞成按照实际工作的需要去学。他们片面地看到学习与工作差异的一面，而看不到两者统一的一面，错误地认为：“要学习就不能工作，要工作就不能学习。”党委坚决支持大多数人的主张，采取了以实际问题为中心，就实论虚，虚实并举的方法，紧密配合政治运动和生产运动的需要，安排学习内容，把形势任务课和基础课、理论课结合起来，达到学用一致的目的。例如，在建立人民公社的时候，就组织群众和干部学习党中央关于在农村建立人民公社的决议，学习“生产关系一定要适合生产力发展的性质”的理论和辩证法。在农业生产大跃进中，就组织群众学习贯彻农业八字宪法的重要性及其辩证的关系，并按照抓主要矛盾和事物互相联系的哲学原理，大讲农业在国民经济中的地位，和以粮为纲、全面跃进的重大意义。在1959年我社遭到历史上未有的特大干旱的时候，就组织群众学习党的八届八中全会决议等文件，大讲“发挥人的主观能动性”、“谋事在人，成事在人”的道理，批判“三分靠人，七分靠天”的懦夫与懒汉的世界观。1959年冬，配合整风运动，又组织学习了社会主义建设时期的阶级斗争，“三个万岁”，两种世界观的斗争，以及正确区分主流与支流、现象与本质等问题。今年春天又结合讨论和制定全年生产计划，组织学习了“高速度和按比例的关系”的一课。由于自始至终贯彻了理论与实际相结合的方针，把实际工作中的问题提到理论上来分析，又用革命的理论来指导实践，因而使学习收到了“立竿见影”的效果，做到了工作学习互相推动、互相促进，从而使工农群众的理论学习得以坚持下来。
    我们在组织工农群众学理论的工作中，还有一条重要的经验，就是要把这一工作搞好，必须坚持大搞群众运动。在这方面，我们对下列几个问题是这样处理的：
    一、普及与提高的问题：搞学理论的群众运动，首先就是要搞普及。开始时，我们在基层干部中间搞，同时也在一部分农民积极分子中间搞。这些人的学习积极性较高，接受能力较强。后来，他们都成了工农学理论的群众运动的核心力量。他们的劲头来了，学习兴趣浓了，进一步普及就有了条件。当学习运动在这部分人中进行一段时间以后，我们一方面搞这批人学理论的巩固提高工作，在他们中间插红旗，树标兵；另一方面，就积极地搞普及，把学习理论的对象扩展到党、团员和积极分子中间去，同时也在一般群众中进行。这样就使学理论的群众运动不断地向前发展，否定了企图把工农学理论永远固定在基层干部范围内的想法。
    二、重点提高与一般提高相结合。运动开展之初，我们是以公社党委会的同志和公社干部为核心进行提高，然后再进一步地扩大核心力量，把所有的党、团员作为重点提高的对象。我们采取了一些具体措施，例如成立哲学研究所，开办党、团学校，举办积极分子训练班等，这对于重点培养提高骨干很起作用。
    三、组织教学队伍和解决教学力量的问题：我们坚持了群众路线的方法，采取了“土洋”结合，专职和兼职结合，中、小学教师与农民教师相结合的办法。在“谁来教”这个问题上也有过两种主张，一种是主张走“专家”路线，希望上面派来专职理论教员；一种是主张走群众路线，即从群众和干部中培养大批兼职理论教员。我们坚持了后一种路线，一致认为工农群众学理论，固然要有专职理论教员担任教学任务，但重要的是依靠兼职理论教员和广大干部。因为兼职理论教员和社里的干部，有实际工作经验，又熟悉当时当地情况，只要给以帮助，就能够讲课，并且能把课讲得很好。从这一认识出发，党委就边学边教，带头讲课。在党委的影响下，各大队总支书记、生产队支部书记和党、团员、积极分子等也都先后讲起理论课来了。两年来，全社共培养了一支拥有八百多人的工农理论队伍，他们是今后进一步开展工农学理论的一支强大的领导力量。
