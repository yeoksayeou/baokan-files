Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 8th: Terrified by the upsurge of the Japanese people's anger against American imperialism, the Kishi Nobusuke government decided on the 7th that on June 19th, the day US President Eisenhower arrives in Japan, it will deploy 20,000 police officers to patrol the entire area around Tokyo International Airport and the entire street from the airport to the Imperial Palace.

The report said that the Kishi Nobusuke government's National Police Agency decided that on that day, a police post would be set up every two meters along both sides of the road. In addition, security teams will also be deployed at important checkpoints.

This police force will consist of 12,000 police officers from Tokyo and 8,000 police officers from neighboring prefectures. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department's request for police support from other prefectures is the first time since the war.

The newspaper said that the Kishi Nobusuke government's police are trying to prevent ordinary people from approaching certain areas, especially near the US Embassy, before Eisenhower arrives in Tokyo.

According to the "Yomiuri Shimbun," the Japanese National Police Agency, worried about Eisenhower's "safety," decided to suggest to the US government that Eisenhower should not ride in a convertible car after arriving at Tokyo's Haneda Airport, but should instead ride in a sedan with bulletproof glass.

    调集两万警察放哨  出动一批喽罗捧场
    岸信介为艾森豪威尔的访问准备种种戒备
    新华社8日讯　东京消息：据日本“产业新闻”透露，在日本人民反对美帝国主义怒潮前面胆战心惊的岸信介政府，7日决定，6月19日美国总统艾森豪威尔到日本那天，将派二万名警察在东京国际机场周围的整个地区以及艾森豪威尔从机场到皇宫的整条街道上实行戒备。
    消息说，岸信介政府警察厅决定，那一天，道路两旁每隔两米就设一个警察哨。另外，在重要的岗口还部署警备队。
    这支警察力量将由东京都的一万二千名警察和邻县的八千名警察组成。东京警视厅要求其他县支援警察，这在战后还是第一次。
    这家报纸说，岸信介政府的警察企图在艾森豪威尔到达东京之前禁止一般人走近某些地区，特别是美国大使馆附近。
    据“读卖新闻”报道，日本警察厅担心艾森豪威尔的“安全”，决定向美国政府建议，艾森豪威尔到东京羽田机场后，不要乘敞篷汽车，而改乘装有防弹玻璃的轿车。
