    Henan Persists in the Fight Against Drought, Determined to Plant Summer Crops Well
    By June 20th, over 40 million mu had been rushed into planting across the province. The rush planting campaign is progressing at a rate of over 4 million mu per day. The areas that have not yet been planted are mostly those with poor or very poor water source conditions. Therefore, Henan's fight against drought and rush planting has entered a more arduous stage.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, the broad masses of rural people in Henan Province, with the support of urban residents and government departments and troops, are making every effort to fight drought and rush plant. The drought situation is severe, but the determination of the Henan Party and people to fight drought and rush plant is also very strong. Their slogans are: "Not an inch of land will be given up, every second counts, we will not wait for rain, and we will not stop for light rain." They are determined to ensure that all wheat stubble land is planted well under any circumstances.
    In early June, the summer harvest in Henan Province was basically completed, and the intense summer planting began. Henan has a large summer harvest area and a heavy summer planting task. At this critical juncture, however, a long-lasting drought was encountered. The soil moisture content of most of the cultivated land in the province awaiting planting after the wheat harvest was only about 10%, and some was below 10%, making it impossible to plant. This situation seriously threatens this year's autumn harvest. The Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately issued a call for drought resistance and rush planting, requiring Party organizations at all levels and the people of the province to mobilize, fight tenaciously against the drought, and do everything possible to resist drought and rush planting. Cadres at all levels immediately went to the countryside, leading commune members to join the battle against drought and rush planting. Teachers and students of schools, factory workers, and officers and soldiers of the garrison also strongly supported this battle. As of the 20th, the province had already taken advantage of soil moisture or irrigated and rushed planted 40.5 million mu. The rush planting movement is continuing to advance at a rate of more than 4 million mu per day. From the 18th to the 20th, it rained in the Xinyang and Nanyang prefectures in southern Henan and in parts of Xuchang, but most of the province remained without rain. The areas that have not yet been planted are mostly those with poor water source conditions or very poor water source conditions, some of which are hilly and mountainous areas. Irrigating and planting in these areas is more difficult. Therefore, the province's fight against drought and rush planting has entered a difficult stage.
    This year's summer drought in Henan Province covers a large area and came early. Since late May, most parts of the province have had little rain and the drought is severe. Last year's summer drought occurred during the planting of late autumn crops, but this year it occurred before summer planting, more than a month earlier than last year. Secondly, this year's summer drought occurred in the context of continuous drought in the past. Since July last year, the total rainfall in most parts of Henan Province has only been about half of the same period in previous years, and in fourteen counties it has been less than half of the same period in previous years. Due to the drought lasting for nearly a year, water sources are now also reduced compared to the past, and the water storage capacity of reservoirs and ponds is more than half less than last year, and the Yellow River flow is also two-thirds less than the same period in previous years. The lack of water sources has increased the difficulty of drought-resistant planting, but at the same time it is precisely a manifestation of the tenacity of the entire Party and people of Henan. In this drought-resistant rush planting campaign, the province has organized and mobilized more than 400,000 cadres at all levels and an army of more than 18 million people to fight drought. Drought-resistant planting and seedling protection are the overriding central tasks of the province at present, and urban residents, commercial departments, factories, and schools are also vigorously supporting drought resistance in rural areas. At present, more than 700,000 students and teachers, more than 100,000 enterprise employees, and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army have gone to the countryside to support drought resistance. A large number of workers who have gone to the countryside are repairing tools while fighting the drought. A large number of drought-resistant materials are being continuously transported to rural areas.
    In this fight against drought, the various water conservancy projects built in the past have once again made great contributions. However, due to the continuous development of the drought and the gradual reduction of water sources, under this situation, all localities are doing everything possible to increase sources and reduce expenditure, expand the irrigation area, irrigate one more mu if possible, and plant one more fen to ensure one more fen. In addition to giving full play to the benefits of the original water conservancy projects, Xuchang Prefecture has also drilled more than 13,000 temporary drought-resistant wells, deepened more than 17,000 shallow wells, deepened more than 1,560 ponds, and renovated and newly opened more than 2,940 canals since June. The machine wells in Nanyang Prefecture have played a significant role in this drought resistance, and now there are still more than 5,000 well-drilling professional teams working day and night to drill machine wells, drilling and watering the land at the same time.
    At present, more than 10 million mu of cultivated land in mountainous and hilly areas of Henan Province are in dire need of water for planting, and at the same time, they need to resist drought and rush plant, and also irrigate spring crops. There is also a shortage of water-lifting tools. More than half of the province's ordinary wells and machine wells have not been fully utilized due to a lack of water-lifting tools or tools that are not complete. Due to the drought, there is also a shortage of sweet potato seedlings planned for summer planting. Under the leadership of the Party, the people of the province are relying on the superiority of the people's communes to continue their tenacious struggle against difficulties. In addition to doing everything possible to develop water sources, some fields planned to grow rice are preparing to grow dry crops due to insufficient water sources. Due to the shortage of sweet potato seedlings, they are preparing to plant corn, sesame, beans and other crops on some sweet potato land first, and then replant sweet potato seedlings later, implementing intercropping.

    河南坚持抗旱斗争  决心种好夏播作物
    到六月二十日全省已抢种四千多万亩。抢种运动正以每天四百多万亩进度前进。现在还未种上的地区，多是水源条件较差或很差的地区，因此河南抗旱抢种斗争，已进入更加艰苦的阶段。
    据新华社讯　河南省广大农村人民在各级党委的领导下，在城市人民和机关、部队的支援下，正在全力突击抗旱抢种。旱情严重，但河南党和人民抗旱抢种的决心也很大。他们的口号是：“寸土不让，分秒必争，无雨不等，小雨不停”，任何情况也要保证把全部麦茬地种上、种好。
    6月上旬，河南全省的夏收基本结束，紧张的夏种开始了。河南夏收面积大，夏种任务也重。当此紧要关头，却遇到了长期持续的干旱，全省割麦待种的耕地大部土壤含水率仅10％左右，有的在10％以下，无法播种。这种情况严重地威胁着今年的秋季丰收。中共河南省委立即发出了抗旱抢种的号召，要求各级党组织和全省人民公社动员起来，同干旱作顽强的斗争，想尽一切办法抗旱抢种。各级干部立即下乡，带领公社社员投入了抗旱抢种的战斗。各地学校师生、工厂职工、驻军官兵也大力支援这个战斗。截至20日止，全省已经趁墒或浇水抢种了四千零五十万亩。抢种运动正以每天四百多万亩的进度继续前进。18日到20日，河南南部信阳、南阳两专区和许昌部分地区下雨，但全省大部地区仍然无雨。现在还未种上的地区，多是水源条件较差或水源条件很差的地区，其中有些是丘陵山区。这些地区浇水下种比较艰苦。因此全省抗旱抢种的斗争，已进入了艰苦的阶段。
    河南省今年夏旱面积大，而且来得早。全省绝大部分地区从5月下旬以来就雨水稀少，旱象严重。去年夏旱是在晚秋作物播种时发生的，今年在夏种前就发生，比去年提前了一个多月。其次，今年夏旱是在过去连续干旱的情况下出现的。从去年7月份以来，河南大部地区总降雨量仅及往年同期的一半左右，有十四个县还不到往年的一半。由于旱情连续将近一年，现在水源也比过去减少了，水库坑塘的蓄水量都比去年减少一半以上，黄河流量也比往年同期减少三分之二。水源缺乏增加了抗旱播种的艰苦性，但同时也正表现了河南全党全民的顽强性。这次抗旱抢种，全省共组织动员了四十多万名各级干部和一千八百多万群众的抗旱大军。抗旱抢种保苗是全省当前压倒一切的中心工作，城市居民、商业部门、工厂、学校也都大力支援农村抗旱。现在全省已有七十多万名学生和教师，十万多名企业职工和解放军官兵下乡支援抗旱。大批下乡工人，边抗旱边修理工具。大批抗旱物资，源源运向农村。
    在这次抗旱斗争中，过去兴修的各项水利工程又立下了汗马功劳。但是由于干旱持续发展，水源逐渐减少，在这种情况下，各地都千方百计地开源节流，扩大灌溉面积，多浇一亩是一亩，多种一分保一分。许昌专区除了充分发挥原有水利工程效益外，6月以来还打临时抗旱井一万三千多眼，加深浅井一万七千多眼，加深坑塘一千五百六十多个，整修和新开渠道两千九百四十多条。南阳专区的机井在这次抗旱中发挥了显著的作用，现在全区还有五千多个打井专业队在日夜赶打机井，边打边浇地。
    目前，河南省山区和丘陵地区还有一千多万亩耕地下种所需的水源极感缺乏，而且，一面要抗旱抢种，一面又要浇灌春耕作物；提水工具又感不足，全省有一半以上的普通水井和机井，由于缺乏提水工具或工具未能配套，还没有充分利用；计划夏栽的甘薯，由于干旱，薯秧也感不足。全省人民在党的领导下，正依靠人民公社的优越性，再接再厉地同困难展开顽强斗争。除了千方百计地开辟水源以外，有些计划种植水稻的田地，因水源不足，准备改种旱作物；薯秧不足，准备在一部分薯地上先种上玉米、芝麻、豆子等作物，以后再补栽薯秧，实行间种。
