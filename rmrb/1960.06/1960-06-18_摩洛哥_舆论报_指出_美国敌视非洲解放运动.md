Xinhua News Agency, Rabat, June 11th: The Moroccan "Opinion Newspaper" condemned the United States for supporting colonialism in Africa, especially supporting France in the Algerian war. The newspaper said that the United States "openly declares its support for French colonialism."

The newspaper pointed out that the United States, instead of drawing useful lessons from the South Korean, Iraqi, Cuban, and Turkish events, stubbornly persists in its policy of hostility and even aggression towards the African liberation and progress movements.

The "Opinion Newspaper" concluded by writing that if the United States continues to support colonialism, sooner or later it will encounter in Africa what it has encountered in Asia and Latin America, because it adopts a colonialist policy that is hostile to the people of those countries.

    摩洛哥“舆论报”指出
    美国敌视非洲解放运动
    据新华社讯　塔斯社拉巴特11日讯：摩洛哥“舆论报”谴责美国支持在非洲的殖民主义，特别是支持法国在阿尔及利亚的战争。这家报纸说，美国“公开宣称它支持法国殖民主义”。
    这家报纸指出，美国不但不从南朝鲜、伊拉克、古巴和土耳其事件中吸取有益的教训，反而顽固地坚持对非洲解放和进步运动的敌视乃至侵略的政策。
    “舆论报”最后写道，如果美国仍然继续支持殖民主义的话，那末，它在非洲早晚会遇到它在亚洲和拉丁美洲所遇到的事情，因为它采取敌视那些国家的人民的殖民主义政策。
