Xinhua News Agency, June 17th, Tokyo: The National Council Against Revision of the "Security Treaty" held a meeting of its executive committee today, deciding on an emergency action plan that includes a rally of 270,000 people on the 18th.

According to this plan, the "National Council" will hold a conference on the 18th at Miyakezaka Plaza in Tokyo, with representatives from all sectors and groups participating, to demand the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet, the immediate dissolution of the Diet, the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and to protest the bloody suppression of demonstrators.

The plan stipulates that on the 18th, there will be two routes for the demonstrations: one will hold demonstrations in front of the Liberal Democratic Party headquarters, the Diet, the Prime Minister's official residence, the U.S. Embassy, and Kishi Nobusuke's private residence; the other will pass through Tokyo's main streets such as Ginza and demonstrate in front of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department.

The executive committee also decided to hold a funeral service for Michiko Kamba, the female student killed by the police authorities, on June 23rd at the Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium.

Xinhua News Agency, June 17th, Tokyo: In protest against the Kishi Nobusuke government's "June 15th" massacre of demonstrating student Michiko Kamba, many universities in Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka held strikes and protest rallies today. Almost all professors have joined this protest movement.

Tokyo University, where Michiko Kamba was studying, held a protest rally today and decided to hold an indefinite strike starting today until the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet is overthrown. Tomorrow, the entire student body will hold a campus funeral for the heroically sacrificed Michiko Kamba, then demonstrate in front of the Diet and carry out protest activities all night. The faculty of the Faculty of Law also decided to suspend classes.

Today, in front of the bulletin board near the front gate of Tokyo University, crowds of students were gathered. The bulletin board was covered with many protest telegrams and messages of condolence, as well as a statement of protest from President Seiichi Kaya to Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke and the police authorities. In the afternoon, students wearing mourning badges distributed leaflets to citizens in Tokyo's downtown area.

Waseda University, which decided to hold an indefinite strike yesterday, held a protest rally today in the large square in the center of the campus. All entrances to the school buildings were blocked with tables and chairs, with photos of police brutality against demonstrating students on the Diet grounds pasted on the tables and chairs.

The entire faculty and students of Meiji University went on strike and suspended classes to protest the police brutality that injured many students and seven professors from the school.

Four thousand students from Hosei University held two rallies today. Professors and students at this university are preparing to hold a joint protest strike and suspension of classes.

Tokyo University of Education, which was searched by the police authorities on June 13th, is holding a five-day strike, which will continue until tomorrow.

Near the main stations in Tokyo, groups of students are conducting fundraising campaigns to help the victims of police brutality. Students fundraising near Ikebukuro Station in Tokyo raised more than 320,000 yen in one day yesterday.

The flames of anger protesting the "June 15th" tragedy are also burning in other universities across the country. Universities across the country have launched strikes and demonstrations, demanding the resignation en masse of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet, the dissolution of the Diet, the dismissal of the Superintendent General of the Metropolitan Police Department, and the severe punishment of the murderers of the students.

Kyoto University, Doshisha University, and Ritsumeikan University all began strikes and held protest rallies today.

Three thousand students in Nagoya held a general mobilization rally at 3:30 p.m. today below the Nagoya TV Tower.

Hosei University, Tokyo Women's University, and Gakushuin University held meetings on June 16th, attended by representatives of professors and students, and passed resolutions strongly condemning the fascist atrocities of the Kishi Nobusuke government and the police authorities in suppressing demonstrating students, demanding Kishi Nobusuke's resignation and the immediate dissolution of the Diet.

Xinhua News Agency, June 17th, Tokyo: The Central Executive Committee of the Japan Socialist Party held a meeting today, deciding to do everything possible on the 17th and 18th to prevent the House of Councillors from "passing" the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and firmly demanding that the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet resign and dissolve the Diet before the treaty "naturally takes effect" on the 19th.

The Socialist Party also decided that in order to prevent the Kishi Nobusuke group from forcibly "voting" on the new "Security Treaty" in the House of Councillors, its members of both houses of the Diet would unite and act together, even resorting to force. The Socialist Party pointed out that the new "Security Treaty" illegally "passed" unilaterally by the Kishi Nobusuke group in the House of Representatives on May 20th has always been invalid and does not recognize that the treaty will "naturally take effect" on the 19th.

Xinhua News Agency, June 17th, Tokyo: Five women's groups in Japan issued a joint statement today, protesting the Kishi Nobusuke government's suppression of students and creation of a bloody tragedy, and demanding the immediate resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet. The statement said that the police not only wielded batons to beat students, but also deliberately condoned the violence of violent gangs. As mothers, we feel extremely indignant.

The five women's groups that issued the joint statement are: the Japanese Women's Suffrage League, the Young Women's Christian Association of Japan, the Women's Christian Temperance Union of Japan, the Japan Women's Peace Association, and the Tokyo Regional Women's Group Federation.

They also sent representatives to the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Superintendent Ogura today to lodge a strong protest and delivered the statement to the Kishi Nobusuke government.
