    Rushing to Produce Spare Parts Under the Stars
    In the 14th Residents Committee building of the Fanrong People's Commune in Tiexi District, Anshan, there is a small iron factory that processes tools and auxiliary parts for various factories and mines of Ansteel.
    This small factory was started by nine housewives, so for a time, they couldn't master forging techniques, and they often bumped their hands and feet while working. But none of this stumped them. Under the guidance of Ansteel workers Huang Wanquan and Ma Xibo, they quickly became proficient. The call to support the steel production battle has made these nine women even more motivated. They are rushing to produce spare parts day and night. Now they have processed more than a thousand various parts, including shovels for the Refractory Plant, as well as road plates, hammer heads, etc.

    星夜赶制备件
    鞍山铁西区繁荣人民公社第十四居民委员会楼头，有一座为鞍钢各厂矿加工工具和辅助零件的小铁工厂。
    这座小工厂是由九名家庭妇女办起来的，因此，一时掌握不了锻造技术，干起活来，经常碰手砸脚的。可是这都没有难倒她们，在鞍钢工人黄万全、马锡波的指导下，她们很快的就干熟练了。支援夺钢大战的号召，使这九名妇女的干劲更足了。她们星夜赶制备件。现在已经加工出各种零件一千多个。有给耐火厂的铲刀；还有道板、锤子头等。
