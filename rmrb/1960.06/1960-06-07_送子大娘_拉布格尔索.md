    "Child-Giving Mother" Labugersuo
    By our reporters Liao Youbin and Tao Ya
    At the National Conference of Outstanding Workers in Culture and Education, there was an elderly Mongolian woman, nearly sixty years old, named Labugersuo. For seven years, day in and day out, she has been traveling the Haosu Wusu grassland, delivering babies for the local Mongolian and Han herders. Every baby she delivers is strong and healthy, and both mother and child are safe. People call her "The Child-Giving Mother Sent by Chairman Mao."
    Four years ago, in the Heping Management Area of the Hongge'er Commune, Siziwang Banner, Inner Mongolia, a Mongolian herding woman named Bademahala had a difficult labor. After two days and nights, the baby still hadn't been born, and the whole family thought that the lives of both mother and child were in danger. Upon hearing this, the amateur Mongolian midwife Labugersuo rushed over. After she performed a delivery using the new method, a plump baby boy was safely delivered. The whole family was moved to tears, saying, "This little descendant is a gift from Chairman Mao to our grassland." Soon after, another Mongolian herding woman, Gajjida Chao, thirty-seven years old, gave birth with Labugersuo's help. In the past, due to using the old delivery methods, several of her babies had died one after another. This time, she gave birth to a seemingly stillborn baby boy. In the past, herders would have considered a stillborn baby dead. However, after Labugersuo used the new method of artificial respiration, she revived the seemingly dead infant. The name "Child-Giving Mother" has since spread throughout the neighborhood.
    Labugersuo is very enthusiastic about her amateur midwifery work. Not only does she respond to every request, but she also often proactively seeks out those in need. If you want to know how many women are pregnant in the Heping Management Area of Hongge'er Commune and when they are due, just ask the "Child-Giving Mother," and she will know. She performs prenatal check-ups and postnatal care for every pregnant woman in the vicinity. If she discovers any illness, she immediately helps them find a doctor to treat it, until she helps the mother hold her healthy baby. This spring, when the grassland was covered with snow, the herding woman Caojidega gave birth. At this time, Labugersuo, who was fifty-seven years old, was suffering from gastroenteritis. The herder who came to ask for her help was reluctant to ask her to deliver the baby because she was ill. However, Labugersuo said, "My minor illness will get better quickly with some medicine. I can't let anything happen to the mother and child because of me!" So, Labugersuo mounted her horse while ill, braved the white snowy wind, and rushed to Caojidega's home. After guarding her day and night, she finally helped the baby to be born safely. Immediately afterward, she delivered four more babies while still ill, and each one was healthy and strong. Labugersuo's spirit of not being afraid of hardship is very touching. The Mongolian woman Exi Sadalama named her newborn son Bodebulaga (meaning eternal congratulations) to thank her.
    Particularly touching is the story of Mongolian-Han unity that Labugersuo has left behind in her midwifery work. Last spring, Zhao Xiulan, a young Han female cadre working in the countryside, suddenly experienced abdominal pain one day, making it difficult to move. It seemed like she was about to give birth. However, because she had just arrived in the pastoral area, there was a language barrier, and being her first time, she was embarrassed to talk to others. Labugersuo took the initiative to approach her.
    "Xiulan, you are about to give birth, right? You can hide it from others, but you can't hide it from me. Coming here to our place is like returning to your own home. You can talk about anything you need."
    From then on, Labugersuo took care of Xiulan. A few days before the expected delivery, she noticed that Xiulan hadn't prepared anything. What should she do? Suddenly, she remembered that she had more than ten feet of cloth coupons at home. She secretly went to the store to buy cloth and then spent the evenings sewing clothes, blankets, and mattresses for the child under the kerosene lamp. Soon, she had prepared everything. After Zhao Xiulan gave birth and was unable to produce enough milk, the baby's crying made Labugersuo restless. She went out every day to find milk, cooked it, and fed it to the baby one spoonful at a time until Xiulan was able to produce milk. At the same time, Labugersuo asked someone to write a letter and quickly brought Xiulan's husband to her. When Xiulan left after a month, she held Labugersuo's hand and said with tears in her eyes, "Grandma, I will never forget your kindness in my life." Labugersuo smiled and said, "We should all thank Chairman Mao. It is his old man who has united the Mongolian and Han people into one family."
    Labugersuo spent half her life in the old society. In the past, she had personally witnessed the tragic scene of the spread of venereal diseases and other various diseases on the grassland, the gradual decline of the population, and the worsening of life day by day. She herself gave birth to four children before liberation, two of whom were taken away by old delivery methods and diseases. After liberation, in order to prosper the population of the Mongolian and other minority nationalities, the Party dispatched a large number of medical personnel to go deep into the pastoral areas. Through free treatment, they cured the herders' venereal diseases, enabling Mongolian women who had been unable to bear children for many years to start having children. These new things deeply moved Labugersuo. Later, when the new method of delivery began to be promoted in the pastoral area, Labugersuo heard that this method could improve the survival rate of infants, she couldn't hold back any longer, so she signed up to study in the banner, determined to work for the happiness and prosperity of the people on the grassland. During the two months of study, she overcame the many difficulties of being illiterate and having a poor memory due to old age. Finally, she mastered the delivery techniques and knowledge of new methods of childcare. After returning, Labugersuo often promoted knowledge of maternal and child health, enabling more than forty Mongolian and Han herder households in the Heping Management Area to change their past unhygienic practices of using sand and furnace ash as padding during childbirth. In terms of raising infants, after her efforts to promote awareness, she also completely changed the old habits of wrapping infants in sheepskin and felt and feeding them with cow horns, which were harmful to infants' health. Before liberation, there were only a few infants here, but now there are groups of children, and the population is flourishing.

    “送子大娘”拉布格尔索
    本报记者　廖由滨　陶娅
    全国文教群英会上，有个年近六旬的蒙古族老大娘，名字叫拉布格尔索。她七年如一日地奔波在好苏乌斯草原上，为这儿的蒙汉族牧民接生婴儿。她接生的婴儿个个健壮，母子平安。人们都称她是“毛主席派来的送子大娘”。
    四年前，在现在的内蒙古四子王旗红格尔公社和平管理区，有一个蒙古族牧民妇女巴德玛哈拉，因为难产，两天两夜婴儿还未生下，一家人都认为母婴生命难保了。蒙古族业余接生员拉布格尔索闻讯匆忙赶到，经过她施用新法接生的手术后，一个肥胖的男孩便平安地降生了。全家人一见，都感动地流下眼泪，说：“这个小后代是毛主席送给咱们草原的。”不久，另外一个三十七岁的蒙古族牧民妇女嘎吉达朝，在拉布格尔索的帮助下分娩了。她过去因为用旧法接生，生的好几个婴儿都相继死去。这回，又生了个假死的小男孩。往常牧民们见了假死婴儿，便认为死了。可是，经过拉布格尔索用新法接生的人工呼吸法，却将假死婴儿救活了。“送子大娘”的名字，从此便在邻里传开了。
    拉布格尔索对待自己的业余接生工作非常热心，不仅有求必应，还经常自动找上门来。如果你想了解红格尔公社和平管理区有多少妇女怀孕，什么时候分娩，问一下“送子大娘”，就都知道了。她对邻近的每个产妇，都做到产前检查，产后护理，如发现有病时，她就立刻帮助请医生治疗，直到帮助产妇抱上胖娃娃为止。今年春天，白雪复盖着草原，牧民妇女曹吉德嘎分娩了。这时候，五十七岁的拉布格尔索正患胃肠炎病。来请接生的牧民见她有病，不忍心叫她前去接生。但是，拉布格尔索却说：我这点小病，吃点药很快就会好的，可不能因为我让母子们有个好歹啊！于是，拉布格尔索便带病上马，冒着白茫茫的风雪，赶到曹吉德嘎家。经过她日夜守护，终于使婴儿平安地生了下来。紧接着，她又带病一连接下了四个婴儿，个个健壮。拉布格尔索这种不辞劳苦的精神，很令人感动。蒙族妇女额喜萨德拉玛为了感谢她，将自己初生的男孩命名为博德布拉嘎（永远祝贺的意思）。
    令人特别感动的，是拉布格尔索在接生工作上留下的蒙、汉团结的故事。去年春天，下乡工作的年青汉族女干部赵秀兰，有一天腹部突然疼痛起来，行动不便，看样子快分娩了。但她因为初到牧区，语言隔阂，加之又是初次，不好意思向旁人讲。拉布格尔索便主动接近她。
    “秀兰，你快要分娩了吧，别人瞒得过，你可瞒不过我，来到我们这里，就像回到自己的家一样，有啥事你就只管谈好了。”
    从此以后，拉布格尔索大娘便经常照看着秀兰。快到临产的前几天，发现秀兰什么东西也没准备，这该怎么办？忽然她想起自己家里还有十多尺布票，便瞒着秀兰，跑到店里把布买回来，然后又利用晚上的时间，在煤油灯下，一针一线地给小孩缝起衣服、被子和褥子，不久便把这些东西准备齐全了。赵秀兰分娩后，又缺奶，婴儿的啼哭声，使拉布格尔索坐立不安，她便每天出去找牛奶，找来后煮熟了，又一匙匙地喂，直到秀兰有了奶方止。同时，拉布格尔索还托人写信，把秀兰的爱人很快找了来。当秀兰满月离开的时候，握住拉布格尔索的手，热泪盈眶地说：“大娘，我一辈子也忘记不了您的恩情”。拉布格尔索却微笑着说，“我们都应该感谢毛主席，是他老人家使我们蒙汉族人民团结成一家人”。
    拉布格尔索大娘，在旧社会度过了半生。过去，她亲眼看到过草原上性病和其他各种疾病蔓延，人口逐渐下降，生活一天不如一天的悲惨景象。她自己解放前生了四个孩子，就有两个被旧法接生和疾病夺去了生命。解放后，党为了繁荣蒙古族和其他少数民族的人口，派遣大批医务人员深入牧区，通过免费治疗，给牧民们治好了性病，使多年不能生儿养女的蒙族妇女开始了生育。这些新鲜事，深深地感动了拉布格尔索大娘。后来，当牧区开始推行新法接生时，拉布格尔索听说用这个方法能够提高婴儿的成活率，她再也憋不住了，便报名到旗里学习，决心为草原人们幸福和繁荣而努力。在两个月的学习中，她克服了没有文化和年老记忆力不强的重重困难，最后终于掌握了接生技术和新法育儿的知识。回来后，拉布格尔索经常宣传妇婴卫生知识，使和平管理区的四十多户蒙汉族牧民，改变了过去分娩时垫沙土、铺炉灰等不卫生的做法。在抚育婴儿方面，经过她的努力宣传，也彻底改变了过去用羊皮、毛毡包裹婴儿和用牛角喂乳等有损婴儿健康的旧习惯。解放前，这里只有几个婴儿，现在这里孩子成群，人丁兴旺。
