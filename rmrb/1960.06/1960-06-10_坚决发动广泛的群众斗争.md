Resolutely Launch a Broad Mass Struggle
    *People's Daily* Commentator

    Just as the victory of the Seventeenth National Unified Action centered on the June 4th general strike made the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries uneasy, Japan once again sounded the battle horn preparing to launch a new unified action. The Japanese "National Council to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty" decided to launch the Eighteenth National Unified Action from the 11th to the 19th: to hold a large-scale anti-U.S. and anti-Kishi demonstration on the 11th on the scale of a "second May Day"; to launch the second nationwide general strike on the 15th; and to launch a mass movement protesting the U.S. President's visit to Japan on the 19th. This is a most intense struggle by the heroic Japanese people, redoubling their efforts, on the eve of the U.S. imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke group's attempt to force the entry into force of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, and will surely deal a heavier blow to the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries.

    According to the current struggle deployment of the Japanese "National Council to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty," the Eighteenth Unified Action will have a larger scale and mass character. Factories, schools, mines, rural areas, streets... all over Japan will be drawn into the new struggle. In a resolute statement at the Socialist Party's extraordinary representative conference on the 6th, Chairman Inejiro Asanuma said that Japan "is currently at such an important juncture," because "Kishi Nobusuke's reactionary politics has turned the parliament into a mere formality under the dictatorship of the Liberal Democratic Party," "we now only have one road to take: to launch a mass struggle to the end with all the people, unite the angry people to overthrow the Kishi cabinet, and strive for the dissolution of the Diet."

    Indeed, the current struggle situation facing the Japanese people is very serious. The Japanese reactionaries, represented by the Kishi Nobusuke group, are becoming increasingly isolated and difficult under the relentless impact of the waves of struggle by the Japanese people; however, relying on the fact that the parliament, army, police, prisons, and other coercive organs are still in their hands, and relying on the support of U.S. imperialism and MacArthur II, sent to Japan by the United States as a supreme emperor, they are still carrying out the most violent and frenzied resistance. Following the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee's commencement of deliberations on the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty on the 7th, the Kishi Nobusuke traitorous government also unilaterally "deliberated" on this military treaty, which violates the interests of the Japanese nation and threatens Asian peace, in the Senate by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the 8th, and is preparing to have it unilaterally voted on by the Liberal Democratic Party around the 15th. Kishi Nobusuke openly stated that he has no intention of resigning or dissolving the Diet, and even declared that it is the "mission" of the Liberal Democratic Party to resolutely have the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty ratified; he "will never yield" to demonstrations. To this end, he has deployed police formations, mobilized fascist organizations, and conspired to take large-scale suppression measures to persecute the Japanese people participating in the struggle, especially the participants in the June 4th general strike. And in order to protect Eisenhower's visit to Japan, he has also made security plans to deal with the people's demonstrations and marches with "force." Therefore, in order to thwart the plans of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, as decided by the Socialist Party, only by carrying out a mass struggle to the end with all the people can Kishi Nobusuke be thrown under the wheels of history like Syngman Rhee and Menderes!

    The Japanese people, who have been profoundly tempered by seventeen national unified actions, have greatly improved their political awareness. And the great victory of the June 4th general strike not long ago has even more powerfully demonstrated that the Japanese people's organization and awareness cannot be slighted by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. If they dare to take bloody suppression measures, they will only accelerate their own demise. Even Kishi Nobusuke's master, U.S. imperialism, has felt seriously uneasy about this. A "Mainichi Shimbun" dispatch from Washington said that "the U.S. State Department and Congress's optimism about Japan has gradually turned into disappointment and anxiety"; Americans "worry that the United States will eventually 'lose' Japan." History has repeatedly told people that imperialism and all reactionaries, even if they appear temporarily strong and ferocious on the surface, do not take the people seriously and seem to be able to do whatever they want regardless of the will of the people. But when they have done all the bad things and their evil is full, the broad masses of the people are forced to find no other way to go, and they stand up and fight to the death, they will be like a volcano, burying the reactionaries in the raging flames of the people's anger. Were not Nuri al-Said's dynasty in Iraq, Batista's dictatorial government in Cuba, and even Syngman Rhee, protected by American bayonets, all collapsed in one night?

    The U.S.-Japanese reactionaries collude with each other, disregarding the increasingly strong opposition of the broad masses of the Japanese people, and attempt to force the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty into effect before June 19. This kind of acting willfully can only awaken more and more Japanese people. At present, the broad masses of the Japanese people are not only determined to fight to the end to abolish the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, but are also actively launching various actions to force Kishi Nobusuke to dissolve the Diet, force Kishi Nobusuke to step down, oppose Eisenhower's visit to Japan, demand the withdrawal of U.S. U-2 spy planes, oppose the U.S. Seventh Fleet's entry into Kobe port, and demand that the United States withdraw its military bases. It can be predicted that all these constantly developing patriotic and just struggles will converge into an irresistible huge torrent, and one day, sweep the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries into the Pacific Ocean together!

    The Chinese people, who have always shown great concern and support for the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people, express warm support for the larger-scale mass struggle that the Japanese people are about to launch. From our own experience of carrying out a long-term struggle against imperialism, we deeply realize that to finally defeat imperialism and all reactionaries, we must rely closely on the masses of the people to carry out a persistent struggle. We firmly believe that as long as the Japanese people resolutely launch a broad mass struggle, no matter how many difficulties they encounter, they will eventually win the final victory against U.S. imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries!

    坚决发动广泛的群众斗争
    本报评论员
    正当以六·四总罢工为中心的第十七次全国统一行动的胜利使得美日反动派惶惶不安的时候，日本又响起了准备掀起新的统一行动的战斗号角。日本“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”决定将在11日到19日期间展开第十八次全国统一行动：在11日举行“第二个五一节的规模”的反美反岸大示威；在15日展开第二次全国性总罢工；19日展开抗议美国总统访日的群众运动。这是英勇的日本人民再接再厉，在美帝国主义和岸信介集团企图强使日美军事同盟条约生效的前夕，进行的一场最激烈的斗争，必将给予美日反动派以更加沉重的打击。
    根据日本“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”目前的斗争部署，第十八次统一行动将具有更大的规模和群众性，日本全国的工厂、学校、矿山、农村、街头……都将卷入新的斗争。日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎6日在社会党临时代表大会上坚决表示：日本“目前正处于这样一个重要关头”，由于“岸信介的反动政治已经把议会变为自由民主党独裁下的形骸”，“我们现在只有这样一条道路可以走了：同全体人民群众一道，展开群众斗争到底，团结愤怒的国民去打倒岸内阁，争取解散国会”。
    的确，日本人民目前面临的斗争形势，是十分严重的。以岸信介集团为代表的日本反动派，在日本人民的斗争波涛滔滔不绝地冲击下，虽则处境已日益孤立和困难；但是，它自恃议会、军队、警察、监狱以及其他强迫机关迄今掌握在自己手中，仗着有美帝国主义和美国派到日本的太上皇麦克阿瑟第二的撑腰，还在进行最猛烈、最疯狂的反抗。继美国参议院外交委员会在7日开始审议日美军事同盟条约之后，岸信介卖国政府8日也在参议院由执政的自由民主党单独“审议”了这项违背日本民族利益和威胁亚洲和平的军事条约，并准备在15日左右由自由民主党单独表决。岸信介公然表示他既不打算辞职，也不打算解散国会，甚至扬言：坚决使日美军事同盟条约获得批准是自由民主党的“使命”；他“绝不向”示威屈服。为此，他摆下了警察阵势，调动法西斯组织，阴谋采取大规模镇压措施，迫害参加斗争的日本人民、特别是六·四总罢工的参加者。而为了保护艾森豪威尔访日，他还作出戒备计划，以“实力”对付人民的示威和游行。因之，为了挫败美日反动派的计划，正如社会党所决定的，只有同全体人民群众一道开展群众斗争到底。只有运用日本人民强大的实力斗争，才能把岸信介像李承晚、曼德列斯一样，抛到历史的巨轮底下去！
    经过了十七次全国统一行动深刻锻炼的日本人民，政治觉悟已经大大提高。而不久前举行的六·四总罢工的巨大胜利，更有力地表明：日本人民的组织性和觉悟性，是美日反动派所不能轻侮的。如果它们敢于采取血腥镇压的手段，只会加速自己的灭亡。这一点，即使岸信介的主子美帝国主义也感到了严重不安。日本“每日新闻”发自华盛顿的消息说，“美国国务院和国会对日本的乐观看法逐渐变成失望和忧虑”；美国人“担心美国终将‘丧失’日本。”历史一再告诉人们，帝国主义和一切反动派，纵使表面上一时还很强大和凶恶，不把人民放在眼里，似乎可以不顾人民的意志，为所欲为。但是等到它们做尽了坏事、恶贯满盈的时候，广大人民被逼得再也找不出别的路好走，而站了起来拼死地抗争，就会像火山一样，把反动派埋葬在人民的怒火烈焰当中。伊拉克的努里·赛义德王朝、古巴的巴蒂斯塔独裁政府以至美国刺刀保护下的李承晚，不都是这样在一个晚上就垮台了的吗？
    美日反动派互相勾结起来，不顾广大日本人民日益强烈的反对，企图在6月19日以前强使日美军事同盟条约生效。这种一意孤行，只能促使越来越多的日本人民觉醒。目前，广大日本人民不仅决心为废除日美军事同盟条约斗争到底，而且正在积极展开各种行动迫使岸信介解散国会、迫使岸信介下台、反对艾森豪威尔访问日本、要求撤走美国U—2型间谍飞机、反对美国第七舰队开进神户港，要求美国撤销军事基地。可以预计，所有这些不断发展中的爱国正义斗争，将汇合成一股势不可当的巨大洪流，总有一天，把美日反动派一起冲进太平洋里去！
    一向对日本人民的爱国正义斗争寄以莫大关心和支持的中国人民，对于日本人民行将展开的更大规模的群众斗争，表示热烈的支持。我们从自己对帝国主义进行长期斗争的经历中，深深地体会到，要最后击败帝国主义和一切反动派，只有紧紧地依靠人民群众进行坚持不懈的斗争。我们深信，只要日本人民坚决发动广泛的群众斗争，不管还会碰到多少困难，终将赢得反对美帝国主义和日本反动派的最后胜利！
