Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. Hu Keshi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League, congratulated the National Conference of Advanced Workers in Culture and Education on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League today. In his speech, he discussed in detail the relevant issues of youth education, and called on the Communist Youth League members and youth on the cultural and educational front to hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, be proletarian cultural and educational fighters, and contribute their lives to the great cause of communism.

In his speech, Hu Keshi began by talking about the issue of cultivating communist new people. He said that China's more than 200 million young people are the main target of cultural and educational work. They are in a period of growth, and they need to establish their worldview in terms of political ideology, be armed with scientific and cultural knowledge, and be better exercised and strengthened physically. Cultivating them into a new generation with communist consciousness, modern scientific and cultural knowledge, who can engage in both physical and mental labor, is a direct requirement for high-speed socialist construction, and also relates to the future of the great motherland and the inheritance and development of our revolutionary cause.

Hu Keshi requested that the Communist Youth League organizations, under the leadership of the Party and together with all cultural and educational workers, must better adhere to the communist education direction, and guide the vast number of young people to bravely advance on the road of intellectualizing workers and peasants and laborizing intellectuals.

Hu Keshi then talked about how spare-time education is a way for workers and peasant youth to achieve intellectualization in a faster, better, and more economical way. He pointed out that the vast majority of young people in our country are on the posts of industrial and agricultural production, and they are the most active factors in developing social productive forces. With the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the huge development of the mass technological revolution movement, the demands of workers and peasant youth to learn culture are becoming more and more intense. They are determined to completely remove the "illiterate" label culturally while fundamentally changing the "poor" face economically. At present, more than 80 million young people across the country have participated in spare-time learning, and nearly 10 million have entered spare-time middle schools. More than 300,000 people are studying in on-the-job workers' spare-time universities, which is more than twice the total number of college students in school in the highest year before liberation.

Hu Keshi said that the current issue is to make the spare-time learning movement consistent and continuously improve. Learning culture and science is a long-term and huge task. Without regular political and ideological work and correct and effective measures, learning and stopping, doing something for a few days and then doing nothing for a few days, cannot achieve results. We must educate the vast number of workers and peasant youth to establish the lofty aspiration to march towards culture, carry forward the spirit of hard work, perseverance, and continuous revolution. As long as we persevere and persist, from literacy, to elementary school, to middle school, to university, we can completely succeed by carrying out one battle after another.

When talking about organizing educated youth to participate in production labor, closely combining with production, and carrying out mass scientific and technological activities, as well as the achievements of youth scientific and technological activities on various fronts, Hu Keshi emphasized that closely combining with production and carrying out youth scientific and technological activities can not only stimulate the enthusiasm of young people to learn and study science, but also cultivate the communist style and the spirit of serving the people of young people, and not only promote the leap forward in production, but also produce a large number of scientific and technological talents from working people and closely linked to workers and peasants, which is of great significance for accelerating the realization of the intellectualization of workers and peasants and the laborization of intellectuals. We should, while actively organizing young people to participate in production labor, further carry out the mass movement of science and technology, and we must get all the high, large, sophisticated, cutting-edge, and new science and technology in our hands.

Hu Keshi then spent a relatively long time talking about the issue of further carrying out the movement of studying Marxism-Leninism and studying Mao Zedong's works among young people. He demanded that theoretical study be further combined with the current domestic and international political struggles, combined with the current production struggle centered on technological revolution, and combined with carrying out cultural revolution and conducting ideological transformation, so as to greatly improve the communist consciousness and moral character of young people, and improve the ability of young people to understand the world and transform the world. He said that this is the fundamental issue of the ideological construction of our country's youth, and also the major responsibility of the Communist Youth League organizations and cultural and educational workers.

Hu Keshi especially mentioned that in order to save its dying fate, imperialism headed by the United States not only continues to pursue a policy of war and a policy of aggression under the guise of peace, but also uses its loyal lackeys, the modern revisionists, to spread bourgeois ideological toxins and tamper with Marxism-Leninism in order to disintegrate people's revolution, oppose socialism, and enslave the whole world. They vainly attempt to find a market among some young people, especially some educated young people, in socialist countries. However, the youth of our country, who have grown up in long-term revolutionary struggles, have a high degree of political consciousness. Under the guidance of the Party and Chairman Mao, they have a deep understanding of the wolfish nature of imperialism and the ugly face of modern revisionism, firmly believe that the people's revolutionary struggle is the decisive force, and never have any illusions about the enemy. They have shown unparalleled firmness and courage in the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism. The enemy's conspiracies have been and will continue to be shamefully defeated.

Hu Keshi finally said that Mao Zedong Thought is our invincible and powerful weapon for engaging in political and ideological struggle, and it is of great and decisive significance for guiding the healthy growth of the younger generation. Armed with Mao Zedong Thought, we can enable young people to establish a firm and correct political direction, improve the ability of class analysis, establish a proletarian worldview, eliminate the political and ideological influence of the bourgeoisie, and in complex and sharp struggles, always be able to identify enemies and friends, will not lose their way forward, and become strong communist fighters.

    胡克实在全国文教群英会上号召共青团员和青年
    做无产阶级文化教育战士
    新华社3日讯　中国共产主义青年团中央书记处书记胡克实今天在全国文教先进工作者代表大会上，代表共产主义青年团中央委员会向大会祝贺。他在讲话中详细地谈到了青少年教育的有关问题，并且号召文教战线的共青团员和青年，高举毛泽东思想红旗，做无产阶级的文化教育战士，为共产主义的伟大事业贡献出自己的一生。
    胡克实在他的讲话中，一开始就谈到了培养共产主义新人的问题。他说，我国二亿多青少年是文化教育工作的主要对象。他们正处在成长时期，他们在政治思想上需要确立自己的世界观，在知识上需要科学文化的武装，在体质上需要更好地锻炼和增强。把他们培养成具有共产主义觉悟，又有现代科学文化知识，既能从事体力劳动，又能从事脑力劳动的新一代，是高速度建设社会主义的直接要求，也关系着伟大祖国的未来，关系着我们革命事业的继承和发展的大事。
    胡克实要求共青团组织，一定要在党的领导下，和全体文化教育工作者一起，更好地坚持共产主义的教育方向，引导广大青少年，在工农群众知识化和知识分子劳动化的道路上奋勇前进。
    胡克实接着谈到了业余教育是使工农青年多快好省地达到知识化的途径。他指出，我国绝大多数青年都在工农业生产岗位上，他们是发展社会生产力的最活跃的因素。随着工农业生产的继续跃进和全民技术革命运动的巨大发展，工农青年学习文化的要求越来越强烈。他们决心在根本改变经济上“穷”的面貌的同时，彻底摘掉文化上的“白”帽子。现在全国已有八千多万青年参加了业余学习，进入业余中学的近千万人。在职工业余大学学习的也有三十多万人，这个数字比解放前最高年份在校大学生的总数还要多一倍。
    胡克实说，现在的问题就是要使业余学习运动做到坚持经常、不断提高。学习文化科学是一个长期的巨大的任务，没有经常的政治思想工作和正确有力的措施，学学停停，三天打鱼，两天晒网，是不能获得成效的。我们必须教育广大工农青年树立向文化进军的雄心壮志，发扬刻苦顽强、不断革命的精神，只要持之以恒，坚持不懈，从扫盲、上小学、上中学到上大学，一个战役又一个战役地进行下去，是完全可以成功的。
    在谈到组织知识青年参加生产劳动、密切结合生产，大搞群众性的科学技术活动，以及各战线上青年科学技术活动的成就时，胡克实强调指出，密切结合生产，开展青年科学技术活动不仅可以激发青年学习和研究科学的热情，而且可以培养青年的共产主义风格和为人民服务的精神，不仅可以促进生产的跃进，而且可以生长出大批劳动人民出身的和与工农密切联系的科学技术人才，这对于加速实现工农群众知识化和知识分子劳动化，都具有重大的作用。我们应当在积极组织青年参加生产劳动的同时，进一步大搞科学技术的群众运动，一定要把一切高、大、精、尖、新的科学技术都拿到手里。
    胡克实然后以较长的时间讲述了在青年中进一步开展学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛泽东著作运动的问题。他要求，进一步把理论学习同当前国内外的政治斗争结合起来，同当前以技术革命为中心的生产斗争结合起来，同开展文化革命、进行思想改造结合起来，极大的提高青年的共产主义觉悟和道德品质，提高青年认识世界、改造世界的战斗能力。他说，这是我国青年思想建设的根本问题，也是共青团组织和文化教育工作者的重大责任。
    胡克实特别提到，以美国为首的帝国主义为了挽救其垂死的命运，不仅在和平的伪装下，继续推行战争政策和侵略政策，并且利用其忠实走狗现代修正主义者来散布资产阶级思想毒素，篡改马克思列宁主义，以达到瓦解人民革命，反对社会主义和奴役全世界的目的。他们妄想在社会主义国家的一部分青年，特别是一部分知识青年中间，来寻找市场。但是，在长期革命斗争中成长起来的我国青年，具有高度的政治觉悟。他们在党和毛主席的教导下，深刻认识到帝国主义的豺狼本性和现代修正主义的丑恶面目，坚信人民革命斗争才是决定一切的力量，从不对敌人抱有任何的幻想，他们在对帝国主义和现代修正主义的斗争中表现了无比的坚定和勇敢。敌人的阴谋诡计已经遭到并且必将继续遭到可耻的失败。
    胡克实最后说，毛泽东思想是我们从事政治和思想斗争的战无不胜的强大武器，对指导青年一代的健全成长具有伟大的决定性意义。用毛泽东思想武装起来，就能使青年树立坚定正确的政治方向，提高阶级分析的能力，树立无产阶级世界观，肃清资产阶级的政治影响和思想影响，在复杂尖锐的斗争中，永远能够识别敌我真伪，不会迷失自己前进的方向，成为共产主义的坚强战士。
