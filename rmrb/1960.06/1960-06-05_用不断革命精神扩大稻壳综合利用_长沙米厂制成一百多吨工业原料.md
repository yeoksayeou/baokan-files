Changsha, June 4th (By Our Correspondent) The First Changsha Rice Mill in Hunan Province, with the spirit of continuous revolution, has achieved great success in expanding the comprehensive utilization of rice husks. The mill now uses rice husks to produce eight kinds of industrial raw materials in batches, including activated carbon and water glass, an increase of four kinds compared to last year. From January to April of this year, the total output reached 125 tons, equivalent to 1.8 times that of the same period last year; the output value was more than 20,000 yuan, an increase of 201 times compared to the same period last year; the quality has also improved significantly. These products, in addition to meeting the needs of chemical, pharmaceutical, and leather factories in Changsha, Zhuzhou, Shaoyang and other cities in the province, are also sold to other provinces and cities.

Adhering to the spirit of continuous revolution and constantly struggling against right-leaning conservative thinking are the main reasons for the continuous expansion of the comprehensive utilization of rice husks in the First Changsha Rice Mill. At the beginning of the trial production of mixed liquid, some workers had mysterious ideas, believing that extracting industrial raw materials from rice husks required good technology and their own level was too low to do it. The Party branch educated everyone to dare to think and dare to do, and to study hard. As a result, the mixed liquid was successfully trial-produced. After the mixed liquid was successfully trial-produced, some workers were still not confident in trial-producing other new products. At this time, the Party branch organized the workers to carry out experimental research on the one hand, and sent people to learn from experience on the other hand. Worker He Guobin was originally a rice carrier with only a primary school education. When he was trial-producing activated carbon, he didn't understand the principles of chemistry. During the day, he sought advice from teachers and friends, and at night, he tried to make it according to the formulas dictated by others. After more than sixty experiments failed, he felt a little discouraged. The Party branch educated him, explaining that the emergence of new things is not always smooth sailing. As long as there is perseverance and determination, the experiment will definitely succeed. He Guobin plucked up his courage and continued to conduct many experiments, and finally made a kind of powdered activated carbon.

Implementing the policy of using indigenous methods and making do with whatever is available is another key to the First Changsha Rice Mill's expansion of the comprehensive utilization of rice husks. With the continuous increase of products and the continuous expansion of production, the factory encountered difficulties in equipment such as insufficient factory area and lack of basic construction raw materials. However, under the leadership of the Party branch, they solved the problem by adopting indigenous methods and being frugal. They merged part of the rice processing workshop, giving up 800 square meters of factory space, which doubled the rice husk comprehensive utilization workshop. When building the activation furnace, they lacked bricks, so they demolished the rotten and broken walls in the factory, totaling more than 50,000 pieces, accounting for half of the required number, and built a total of twelve activation furnaces, hydrolysis furfural stoves, etc. Making granular activated carbon requires a strip pressing machine, which is estimated to cost more than 500 yuan. In order to save expenses, they found a discarded rice milling machine and modified it. As a result, it only cost more than 10 yuan to make a copper plate, and the rest was made of materials from the discarded rice milling machine. Through these methods, the factory's equipment capacity has been greatly improved. For example, the daily output of powdered activated carbon has increased from more than 50 jin to more than 200 jin.

Expanding comprehensive utilization has greatly increased the value of rice husks. Every 100 jin of rice produces 20 jin of rice husks. Calculating by producing mixed liquid, powdered activated carbon, water glass, and other three products, the value exceeds one times the price of the original rice.

### 用不断革命精神扩大稻壳综合利用  长沙米厂制成一百多吨工业原料

    用不断革命精神扩大稻壳综合利用
    长沙米厂制成一百多吨工业原料
    本报长沙4日电　湖南长沙市第一大米厂用不断革命的精神，扩大稻壳综合利用，取得了很大成绩。现在这个厂已利用稻壳成批地生产活性炭、水玻璃等八种工业原料，比去年增加四种。今年1月到4月总产量达一百二十五吨，等于去年同期的一点八倍；产值二万多元，比去年同期增加二百零一倍；质量也有显著提高。这些产品除供应省内长沙、株洲、邵阳等市化工、制药、制革等工厂的需要外，有的还外销其他省市。
    坚持不断革命的精神，经常与右倾保守思想作斗争，是长沙市第一大米厂稻壳综合利用不断扩大的主要原因。在开始试制混合液时，有的工人存在神秘观念，认为从稻壳中提炼工业原料，需要好的技术，自己水平低，搞不了。党支部便教育大家要敢想敢做，刻苦钻研。结果试制成了混合液。混合液试制成以后，有些工人对试制其他新产品仍是信心不足。这时，党支部一面组织工人大搞试验研究，一面派人到外面取“经”。工人何国斌原先是个背米工人，只有初小文化程度，在试制活性炭时，不懂化学原理，白天就去求师访友，晚上根据人家口授的配方试制，试验六十多次没有成功，这时有些灰心了。党支部便向他进行教育，说明新鲜事物的产生不是一帆风顺的，只要有恒心，有决心，就一定可以试验成功。何国斌鼓起了勇气，又继续进行了多次试验，终于制成了一种粉状活性炭。
    贯彻土法上马、因陋就简的方针，是长沙市第一大米厂扩大稻壳综合利用的又一关键。随着产品不断增加，生产不断扩大，这个厂在设备上遇到了厂房面积不够、基建原材料缺少等困难。但他们在党支部的领导下，采用土法、勤俭节约的办法解决了。他们把大米加工车间合并了一部分，让出厂房八百平方米，这样使稻壳综合利用车间扩大了二倍。修建活化炉时缺少砖，他们便把厂内的烂墙破墙拆掉，一共有五万来块，占需用数的一半，一共修建了活化炉、水解糠醛灶等十二座。制颗粒活性炭要用压条机，估计要五百多元，为了节省开支，他们便找来一部废打米机改装，结果只用十多元制了一块铜板，其余全部是用废打米机的材料制成的。通过这些办法，这个厂的设备能力大大提高。例如粉状活性炭日产水平就由原来的五十多斤提高到二百多斤。
    扩大综合利用大大提高了稻壳的身价。每百斤稻谷产稻壳二十斤，以它生产混合液、粉状活性炭、水玻璃等三种产品计算，价值超过原稻谷价格的一倍。
