A Thoughtful Person Sells Fans (Clapper Talk)
    Mingming
    (Fast Tempo) Pooling capital, custom-made, Japanese paper fans.
  (Slow Tempo) Transported back to Guangdong, sold at reduced prices, two cents each. Those willing to buy, take a look, at the fan surface, drawn with, two paintings, with profound meaning contained therein. One side depicts, a beauty, coming to China to work; the other side depicts, an ox being whipped. Please also look at, the inscription, the meaning is clear and simple. Spend two cents, to buy one, you will understand. You must know, I sell fans, not for profit. But rather, borrowing from the paintings, to inspire the hearts of our compatriots. (Medium Tempo) Asking compatriots, do you know, natural selection, the superior win, the inferior lose, striving for survival. Our China, has been weak until now, reaching its limit, repeatedly subjected to, foreign bullying, truly pitiful! Today, the United States, is even more sinister, treating our compatriots, with all kinds of harshness, unspeakable suffering! Even more unbearable, they want to make treaties forbidding Chinese laborers, from coming to the Americas. Our people, have no grudges against other countries, so why are we viewed with such suspicion? Foreigners, coming to China to make a living, are also numerous, truly, in today's world, there is no justice, only power. Asking, my compatriots, are we to let foreigners trample upon us? At this time, if we don't think about resistance, when will we? Various charitable halls, and people of lofty ideals, have already convened many meetings, hoping that, they will not give up halfway, and must have courage and determination. I today, sell these fans, only to supplement what they have not yet finished, so that everyone, knows, the disaster is at hand. Hoping that compatriots, still need to, unite and strive. (Concluding Tempo) Form organizations, plan boycotts, do not delay.

    有心人卖扇（班本）
    明明
    （扫板）醵资本，定制那，东洋纸扇。
  （慢板）运回粤，减价平沽，每把二仙。愿买者，看一看，那扇子上面，绘着的，两幅画，原有深意存焉。有一边，绘的是，那美人，将来华工作践；这一边，绘的是，牛受笞鞭。更请看，那题词，语意显浅。费二仙，买一把，自可了然。须知道，我卖扇，非为牟利起见。不过是，借那画，激发同胞心田。（中板）问同胞，可晓得，物竞天演，优者胜，劣者败，争生竞存。我中国，积弱至今，已达极点，屡受那，外人欺侮，真是可怜！今日里，那美国，立心更险，将我同胞，种种苛待，苦不堪言！更难堪，还要立约禁我华工，不准到他美洲这便。我国人，与他国素无仇怨，却为何这等见嫌？他国人，到我中国营生，亦有不鲜，真果是，今之世界，并无公理，只有强权。问一声，我同胞，难道任外人作践？到此时，不思抵抗，更待何年？各善堂，诸志士，经已集议多遍，更望他，切莫半途而废，须要志勇心坚。我今日，卖这扇，只算补他未尽，令人人，皆知道，祸在目前。望同胞，还须要，合群奋勉。（收板）结团体，谋抵制，不可迟延。
