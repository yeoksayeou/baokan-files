Use Mao Zedong's Strategic Thinking to Fight the Battle of Production
Li Ruihuan, Leader of the Youth Shock Brigade of Carpenters, Beijing Third Construction Company

Leadership of Production Cannot Be Separated from Mao Zedong Thought

Before 1958, I had studied some of Chairman Mao's works, but I didn't study them seriously and didn't grasp them profoundly. In March and April of 1958, I became the leader of the Youth Shock Brigade of Carpenters. I had to direct the production of the entire team, and I was full of energy, but I lacked methods and didn't know where to start. So, I tried to study. I studied Chairman Mao's works "On Practice," "On Contradiction," "Concern for the Well-being of the Masses and Attention to Methods of Work," and "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War" very carefully. I read "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War" several times, reading some paragraphs over and over again. The more I read, the more enlightened I became and the more inspired I was. I had seen the movie "Southward Expedition and Northward War," which showed Chairman Mao's brilliant strategic policy, and I was also very inspired. I thought that whether we were fighting Japan or the Kuomintang reactionaries, our weapons were worse than the enemy's, but in the end, we completely defeated the enemy. Wasn't this a victory for Chairman Mao's strategic thinking? However, this time I studied Chairman Mao's works in connection with the situation in the team, and I learned and applied them, and I saw the results. My understanding was even greater. Over the past two years, I have deeply realized one thing: although production is not exactly the same as fighting a war, because the object of war is living people and the situation changes more complicatedly, production is also a kind of war. Leading production and commanding operations are the same, and all cannot be separated from Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao taught us: strategically, we should despise the enemy, and tactically, we should pay attention to the enemy. This truth also applies to leading production. Some specific issues that Chairman Mao talked about, such as how to scout, how to make decisions, how to use troops, and how to change operational plans according to the situation, are also completely applicable to leading production. Therefore, when I was studying, I studied, thought, and applied it according to the needs of my work. Sometimes I simply memorized what Chairman Mao said. Looking back at our shock brigade from its establishment to the present, the reason why we have been able to overfulfill various production tasks, and in 1959, the completion of production tasks averaged 155.3% of the quota, and we also carried out 198 technical innovations, all of which were the results of carrying out mass movements on a large scale under the leadership of the Party, and all were some achievements we made under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. Below, I would like to focus on two things to talk about my experience.

Only by Using Mao Zedong's Strategic Thinking to Fight the Battle of Production Can Production Achieve Great Development, Great Victory, and Great Leap Forward

In the second quarter of 1959, our shock brigade was responsible for making the floor of the banquet hall of the Great Hall of the People. The floor of the banquet hall was technically complex, with strict quality requirements, and the construction period was tight. However, of the 32 members of our team, only two master craftsmen had done this kind of work before, and everyone else had never done it. Therefore, some team members lacked confidence and were very afraid of not being able to complete the task. How should this battle be fought? I remembered that Chairman Mao said: "Know the enemy and know yourself, and you will not be defeated in a hundred battles." I understood that this meant that we must first conduct investigation and research, understand the situation thoroughly, and then correctly make decisions and enter the battle. I was clear about the situation in the team at the time, but I was not familiar with other technical situations. Therefore, I decided to go to the site with several master craftsmen to investigate the situation and study it thoroughly. There were four types of floors in the banquet hall. After analysis, we determined that the key was the herringbone floor. This work was not only difficult to do, but also if it was not completed, the other two types of floors (long strips and checkerboard hearts) could not be started. However, according to the old method, a maximum of only two people could operate on the herringbone floor at the same time. This was another problem: too many people, it was too crowded; too few people, it was impossible to break through, which could delay the entire project. Therefore, we continued to understand and repeatedly pondered. Finally, we found the angular relationship between the herringbone boards and came up with a new method: first nail the middle row of herringbone boards, and then divide the unnailed area into several equal parts, with each equal part operated by one member. According to the stubble of the middle row of herringbone boards, as long as the angle is adjusted well, all the herringbone boards will definitely match the stubble. In this way, we formulated a battle plan based on Chairman Mao's strategic thinking: focus our attention on the most important and decisive parts of the overall situation, and use our main force to fight the battle of the herringbone floor first. After this battle, we will then fight the battle of the long strip floor and the checkerboard heart floor; at the same time, we will use secondary forces to make the reed mat pattern floor. The original construction period for this task was 45 days, and we completed it in eight days.

In "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War," Chairman Mao taught us: after the battle begins, we must check the original plan at any time. If we find that it does not conform to the actual situation, or if the situation has changed, we must decisively make a decision and modify it. We have had a lot of experience in this regard, and it was the same when making the floor of the banquet hall. At that time, we were competing with three other shock brigades and groups, and everyone was full of energy, all holding their breath to complete the task ahead of schedule. However, when it came to the night shift when we were about to finish, I found that due to insufficient material supply, no matter how hard we tried, we would not be able to finish it overnight. If we did not change the plan at this time, we would be like the "reckless man" that Chairman Mao said, blindly working hard, and the result would be nothing but hitting a wall. Therefore, we immediately decided: to withdraw the main force to rest, leaving only a small force to continue preparing, and the next day, let the small force rest and the large force go into battle and carry out a major assault. I told the deployment of our team to another production team that was with us, and asked them to consider not launching an assault, otherwise they might get into a dead end and suffocate themselves. They did not agree with my opinion and insisted on working hard. As a result, they worked and stopped, wasting manpower. They had not completed the task by ten o'clock the next morning, and the team members were so tired that they had to go down to rest. The main force of our team had a good night's sleep, and after going to work, they worked hard and completed the task in half a day. From this incident, I deeply realized the truth of Chairman Mao's saying about "profitable business" and "loss-making business." On the surface, we delayed one night that day and reduced some troops the next day, which seemed to be a "loss-making business," but in fact it was a "profitable business." Retreating in order to advance, and taking detours in order to take the straight road, looks slow, but it is actually the fastest.

Not only was this time that we successfully completed the task under the guidance of Chairman Mao's strategic thinking, but the victories in dozens of competitions were also because we studied and applied Chairman Mao's brilliant strategic thinking. First of all, we strategically despise the enemy. No matter what new task comes, the first thought is that it must be completed and can be completed. Sometimes some team members are not at ease, so we engage in "务虚" [务虚 is a term used in Chinese Communist Party discourse that means "to discuss principles and strategies"] to make everyone understand the significance of the work, understand the objective conditions, and know the overall battle deployment, so that everyone has the confidence to win. When the battle plan needs to be changed temporarily, we also immediately call "assembly," and all team members hold a small meeting for ten or twenty minutes to explain the reasons and boost morale, without letting anyone panic or lose heart. At the same time, we tactically attach importance to the enemy, and after accepting the task, we make full preparations and do not fight unprepared battles. Our preparations often have two sets. If one trick doesn't work, we quickly change to another. This is very important to ensure the victory of the battle. Once, when we were supporting formwork on a construction site of a dormitory building in the western suburbs, we needed to find a few boards to set up to step on to work. We made two sets of preparations the night before. One set was to put the wooden boards on the wall, which would save time; the other set was to find a ladder for backup. Although this was more troublesome, it would not greatly affect the work. The next morning, as soon as we went into battle, the bricklayers thought that putting the wooden boards on the wall would hinder their work, and the first set did not work. So, we immediately moved out the ladder and started working, and as a result, we still overfulfilled the task by seven times. Chairman Mao said that fighting a war requires striving for the initiative. We realize that whether or not we take the initiative, the most important thing is whether we have made good preparations in advance. Of course, things are constantly developing and changing. No matter how thorough we consider when making the plan, new situations may occur, and we must make partial changes or even complete changes, and then we must adapt to the situation. In general, from the experience of our many battles, we increasingly realize the brilliance and greatness of Chairman Mao's strategic thinking. We will win if we follow it, and we will fail if we don't follow it. Only by using Mao Zedong's strategic thinking to fight the battle of production can production achieve great development, great victory, and a great leap forward!

With the Armed Forces of Mao Zedong Thought, Having Lofty Aspirations, and Developing the Spirit of Hard Study and Hard Work, Any Problem Can Be Solved

According to my personal experience, in order to win a beautiful battle in technical innovation and technical revolution, we must also use Mao Zedong's strategic thinking as the guide. Last year alone, our team realized 198 large and small innovation proposals because, under the teachings of the Party, we dared to strategically despise difficulties and tactically attach importance to difficulties. In particular, the creation process of the carpenter's simple calculation method made me deeply realize that as long as we have the armed forces of Mao Zedong Thought, have lofty aspirations, and develop the spirit of hard study and hard work, all problems can be solved.

In the past, there was a saying popular among carpenters: "Laying out is a highly skilled technique that is unattainable, and unless you are Lu Ban, you can't do it without laying out." This means that no matter what kind of work a carpenter does, a master craftsman with high skills must first draw a full-size sample on a flat wooden board, measure the dimensions and angles of each part according to the sample, and make a template before cutting the material for construction. This method is wasteful of materials and labor. An ordinary roof truss actually only takes one worker to make, but it takes one and a half days to lay out, and only "old hands" can do this work. In 1956, I began to ponder: could I think of a scientific method to replace laying out? But when I opened the book, it said how to lay out, and it didn't mention anything about not laying out. When I asked the master craftsmen, they all thought it was difficult. Someone also told me a legendary story, saying that there was a corner beam in the southeast corner of the Hall of Supreme Harmony in Beijing. Before construction, it was not laid out. It was done by an old man with a white beard. After he finished, he disappeared. Later, I found out that it was Lu Ban who came down to earth. Who would dare not lay out except Lu Ban? Some people also heard that I wanted to change this stupid method and thought it was wishful thinking and would definitely not work. However, at that time, the Party branch secretary supported my idea, and I also learned "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," which gave me a lot of ambition. The Foolish Old Man can move mountains, why can't we eliminate laying out? So, I wrote two poems: "Set up the ambition of the Foolish Old Man, why fear the current of the Wise Old Man?" to encourage myself. However, at that time, I only had a fourth-grade education, and my experience and theory were all poor, so I thought hard for several months without any progress. The facts educated me: it is not enough to despise difficulties, we must also pay attention to difficulties. Having lofty aspirations requires culture and ability. The Party branch secretary also told me: "If you want to climb the peak of science and technology, you must first conquer the fortress of culture." So, under the teachings of the Party, I was determined to study culture, master weapons, prepare well, and launch a tenacious attack on the millennium-old routine.

At first, for a period of time, I only thought about how to eliminate laying out, and I didn't think about mastering it well, so I couldn't start. Chairman Mao said: to defeat the enemy, we must first understand the enemy; to eliminate war, we can only wage war, and use just wars to oppose unjust wars. However, I didn't look at the problem that way at first. It was only after taking detours that I slowly understood that only by first mastering laying out can we finally eliminate laying out. From then on, I was enthusiastic about learning the techniques and principles of laying out everywhere. I learned the knowledge in books, and I also learned the experience of the master craftsmen. Some people said that I was "obsessed" and thought that I had given up, but I kept holding my breath, learning science and culture, and learning laying out techniques, and combining them to repeatedly ponder and experiment. When I encountered a master craftsman laying out, I not only watched, but also calculated according to mathematical principles to see if it was right. If it was right, my confidence was even stronger; if it was not right, I would carefully study why. As a result of this research, I discovered two aspects of the problem: on the one hand, the laying out itself was not very scientific, and some places were not as accurate as calculated; on the other hand, it was not enough to rely solely on book knowledge, and we must learn from the rich operational experience of the master craftsmen. Take the size of the crotch root of the roof truss as an example. It must be fixed with screws, and this problem must be considered when calculating, otherwise, when the screws are tightened and pressure is applied, the size will not meet the requirements. I compared the calculations with the layout, and after about ten months, I accumulated a lot of successful and failed experiences and lessons. The set of calculation methods to replace the layout was finally slowly explored.

In September last year, our team accepted a task of supporting the outer eaves formwork at the construction site of the Great Hall of the People. I formally proposed not to lay out, but to cut the material according to the calculated numbers. However, the supervising technician resolutely disagreed, thinking it was not safe, and the quality inspector did not agree either. Some asked me: "If it doesn't work out, can you afford this responsibility?" Some also said to me: "If you want to show your face, you will definitely be embarrassed." At this time, the Party gave me strong support again, asking me to dare to do things that no one had done before, as Chairman Mao said, and at the same time, pay attention to listening to the opinions of the masses. The Party's support strengthened our courage, and we actively prepared. In order to ensure that there were no mistakes and not to fight unprepared battles, on the night before cutting the material, I not only repeatedly verified the calculation using the formula I created, but also made a small sample on the paving board for checking and asked for the opinions of several master craftsmen. At two o'clock in the morning, I ran to the front of the Monument to the People's Heroes with several team members and made several of the most important diagonal lines on the stone slab, and once again checked the calculated numbers. After repeated tests, there were no problems at all. The next day, we boldly abandoned the millennium-old routine of laying out and cut a total of 69 cubic meters of wood, moved it to the roof, and pieced it together. The dimensions were completely correct, and we completed the original seven-day task in only three days. Since 1956, I have always wanted to revolutionize "Grandpa Lu Ban's" life. In 1959, under the encouragement and education of Mao Zedong Thought, I finally realized this wish. However, at first, the comrades with low culture found it difficult to learn my calculation method. A master craftsman said: "If this method can be simplified and turned into several numbers, and can be checked when applied, that would be great." These words gave me a lot of inspiration. I continued to work hard and transformed the original set of formulas, some into easy-to-learn formulas, and some simply into tables, forming a set of simple carpenter's calculation methods. Some time ago, the Architectural Engineering Publishing House has compiled this method into a booklet and published it. Any worker who knows addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can use it to replace laying out.

Mao Zedong Thought is the Truth

For more than two years, from my personal experience, I have deeply realized that Mao Zedong Thought is the truth, and this is absolutely true and not wrong at all. Using Mao Zedong's strategic thinking to fight the battle of production and the battle of technical revolution, we are also invincible and invincible. Of course, this does not mean that no difficulties or failures will occur in the process of battle. Chairman Mao has long said that we cannot demand a general who is always victorious, but only a general who is generally victorious, intelligent and brave. Our team has encountered many obstacles in production. However, we always keep in mind Chairman Mao's teaching: failure is the mother of success. As long as we learn a lesson from every setback and do not suffer a muddleheaded loss, we will turn failure into success, and one victory after another. There are many difficulties in every battle. However, we always keep in mind Chairman Mao's teaching: "A strategist cannot attempt to win a war beyond the limits permitted by the material conditions, but a strategist can and must strive to win a war within the limits permitted by the material conditions. The stage for the activities of a strategist is built on the objective material conditions, but the strategist, relying on this stage, can direct many vivid, colorful, powerful, and magnificent dramas." We fully believe that as long as we give full play to subjective initiative, no matter how difficult the conditions are, we will definitely complete the task brilliantly and achieve the best results. Now, under the leadership of the Party, all our team members are full of fighting spirit. We have realized the complete mechanization and semi-mechanization of all operations, but everyone is not satisfied and is confidently advancing towards linkage. I can guarantee to everyone that in the future, we will definitely study Chairman Mao's works more diligently, further arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, and in the movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, in the great struggle to realize the continuous leap forward in this year and the entire 1960s, we will fight more beautiful battles and make greater contributions to socialism and communism!

    用毛主席的战略思想打生产仗
    北京市第三建筑公司木工青年突击队长　李瑞环
    领导生产不能离开毛泽东思想
    1958年以前，我学过一些毛主席著作，可是学得不认真，领会很不深刻。1958年3、4月间，我当了木工青年突击队长，要指挥全队生产，劲头挺足，但缺少办法，不知道该从哪儿下手，就想办法学习。对毛主席的著作“实践论”、“矛盾论”、“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”、“中国革命战争的战略问题”，我都认真地学习。特别是“中国革命战争的战略问题”，我把它读了好几遍，有些段落翻来复去地读，真是越读思想越开窍，受到极大启发。过去我看过电影“南征北战”，里面表现了毛主席英明的战略方针，我也很受启发，想到不管打日本，打国民党反动派，我们武器都比敌人差，最后却彻底打败了敌人。这不是毛主席战略思想的胜利吗？不过，这回联系队里的情况学习毛主席著作，学了就应用，用了就见效，我的领会就更多一些了。两年来，我深深体会到一条：生产跟打仗虽然不完全一样，因为打仗的对象是活人，情况变化更复杂，但是生产也是一种打仗，领导生产和指挥作战一样，全都不能离开毛泽东思想。毛主席教导我们：在战略上要藐视敌人，在战术上要重视敌人，这个真理也适用于领导生产。毛主席讲的一些具体问题，像如何侦察、下决心，如何用兵，如何根据情况改变作战计划等等，对领导生产也是完全适用的。所以，我在学习的时候，就根据工作需要，边学、边想、边用，有时简直把毛主席说的话都背了下来。回想我们突击队从建队到现在，所以能够超额完成各项生产任务，在1959年，完成生产任务平均达到定额155．3％，还进行了一百九十八项技术革新，这全是在党的领导下大搞群众运动的结果，也全是我们在毛泽东思想指导下取得的一些成绩。下面，我想着重通过两件事，说一说我的体会。
    只有用毛主席的战略思想打生产仗，生产才能大发展、大胜利、大跃进
    1959年第二季度，我们突击队担任做人民大会堂宴会厅的地板。宴会厅的地板技术很复杂，质量要求很严，工期又紧。可是我们全队三十二名队员只有两位老师傅干过这种活，别人全没干过，所以一部分队员信心不足，很怕完不成任务。这个仗怎么打才好呢？记得毛主席说过：“知彼知己，百战不殆”。我领会这意思，就是先要做调查研究，把情况了解周到，才能正确地下决心，投入战斗。当时队里的情况，我还清楚，对其他技术情况却很不熟悉。所以，我就决定和几位老师傅一起，到现场去摸情况，一定把它研究透。宴会厅的地板共有四种，我们经过分析，确定关键是人字地板，这个活不但难做，而且它不完工另外有两种地板（长条的和棋盘心的）就不能开工。可是，按照旧办法，人字地板最多只能两个人同时操作。这又是一个难题：人多了，挤不开；人少了，突不破，有可能使整个工程拖期。于是，我们就继续了解，反复琢磨。最后，终于找到了人字板之间的角度关系，想出一个新办法：先把中间一趟人字板钉好，然后把没钉的地方分成若干个等分，每一个等分由一个队员操作。按照中间一行人字板的碴儿，只要把角度弄好，就一定能使所有的人字板全都对上碴儿。这样，我们就根据毛主席的战略思想订出了作战计划：把注意的重心放在对全局最重要、最有决定意义的地方，用主力先打人字地板仗，打完这一仗，接着再打长条地板和棋盘心地板的仗；同时，用次要兵力去做芦席纹地板。这个任务本来工期是四十五天，我们八天就完工了。
    在“中国革命战争的战略问题”里，毛主席教导我们：战斗开始以后，要随时检查原来的计划，发现与实际情况不符合的地方，或者情况有了变化，就要当机立断，下决心加以修改。我们在这方面，有过不少经验，作宴会厅地板的时候也是这样。当时，我们和另外三个突击队、组比武，上阵后大家劲头都很足，全都憋着劲儿提前完成任务。可是，临到快完工的那个夜班，我发现由于材料供应不足，怎么努力一夜也干不出来了。这时候如果不改变计划，那就会像毛主席说的“鲁莽家”一样，一味盲干下去，结果非碰壁不可。因此，我们马上决定：把主力兵团撤下来休息，只留一个小兵团继续作准备工作，第二天再让小兵团休息，大兵团上阵，大搞突击。我就把我们队的部署告诉和我们在一起的另一个生产队，请他们考虑别再突击了，不然就可能走进死胡芦头里，自己憋自己。他们不同意我的意见，还是一个劲地要干下去，结果干干停停，浪费了人力，到第二天上午十点还没有完工，队员却累得非下去休息不可了。我们队的主力睡好了觉，上班后一阵猛干，半天就完成了任务。从这件事情里，我更深深体会到毛主席讲的“赚钱生意”和“蚀本生意”的道理。表面看来，我们那天耽误了一个夜晚，第二天也减少了一些兵力，好像是“赔本生意”，其实这是“赚钱生意”。为了前进而后退，为了走直路而走弯路，看起来慢了，其实是最快的。
    我们不但这一次是在毛主席的战略思想指导下胜利完成了任务，几十次比武的胜利，也都是因为我们学习和运用了毛主席的英明的战略思想。首先，我们在战略上藐视敌人，不管来了什么新任务，头一个想法就是必须完成，能够完成。有时候一些队员心里不踏实，我们就务虚，使大家认识工作的意义，了解客观条件，知道整个战斗部署，使每个人都有必胜的信心。当战斗计划需要临时改变的时候，我们也马上一声“集合”，全体队员开个十几分钟的小会，说明道理，鼓足干劲，不叫一个人慌神泄气。同时，我们又在战术上重视敌人，接受了任务先作充分的准备工作，不打无准备之仗。我们的准备往往有两套，一招不灵，赶紧换一招，这对于保证战斗的胜利十分重要。有一次，我们在西郊一座宿舍楼工地支摸板，需要找几块板子架起来蹬着干，头天晚上就作了两套准备，一套是把木板架在墙上，这样可以省时间；另一套是找一个梯子备用，这虽然比较费事，但有了它工作不至于受到大影响。第二天清早一上阵，瓦工认为把木板架在墙上碍他们的事，第一套果然行不通了，于是我们马上搬出梯子干起来，结果仍然超额七倍完成了任务。毛主席说打仗要力争主动，我们体会主动不主动，最重要的就是事先是否作好准备。当然，事物是不断发展、变化的，订计划的时候考虑多周到，也可能发生新的情况，必须作部分改变甚至于全部改变，那就得随机应变了。总起来说，从我们多次战斗的经验中，越来越体会到毛主席战略思想的英明伟大，照着它办就胜利，不照着办就失败，只有用毛主席的战略思想打生产仗，生产才能大发展、大胜利、大跃进！
    有了毛泽东思想的武装，立下雄心壮志，发扬苦学苦钻精神，什么问题都能解决
    根据我的亲身体会，在技术革新和技术革命中，要想打出漂亮仗，也必须用毛主席的战略思想挂帅。去年一年，我们队实现了一百九十八项大大小小的革新建议，就是因为在党的教导下，敢于在战略上藐视困难同时又在战术上重视困难。特别是木工简易计算法的创造过程，更使我自己深深体会到：只要有了毛泽东思想的武装，立下雄心壮志，发扬苦学苦钻的精神，什么问题全都可以解决。
    过去在木工当中，流行着一句话：“放样技术高不可攀，不放大样除非鲁班”。这就是说：木工不管干什么活儿，都要由技术较高的老师傅，先在铺平的木板上画出实样，根据实样量出各部分的尺寸和角度，并且作出样板，然后再下料施工。这个办法又费料，又费工。一个普通屋架，实际制作只要一个工，放大样就得一天半，而且只有“老把式”才干得了这活。1956年，我就开始琢磨：能不能想个科学办法来代替放大样呢？可是翻开书看，书上都是说如何放大样，根本没提不放大样的事。问老师傅，他们也都认为不好办。有人还给我讲了一个传说的故事，说北京太和殿东南角有个角梁，施工前没有放大样，那是一个白胡子老头干的，干完他就不见了，后来打听才知道是鲁班下界，除了鲁班谁敢不放大样？还有些人听说我想改掉这个笨办法，觉得那是胡思乱想，准不行。可是，当时党支部书记支持我的想法，我又学了“愚公移山”，更长了不少志气，愚公能移山，我们为什么不能消灭放大样？我就写了两句诗：“立下愚公志，何惧智叟流？”用它来勉励自己。不过，那时候我只有小学四年级的文化程度，经验、理论全都差得很，所以苦思了好几个月也没有进展。事实教育了我：光藐视困难还不够，还要重视困难，有了雄心大志还得有文化，有本事。党支部书记也告诉我：“要想攀上科学技术的高峰，必须先攻下文化堡垒”。于是，我就在党的教导下，下决心学习文化，掌握武器，作好准备，向着千年常规发动顽强的进攻。
    起初有一段时间，我只想着怎么消灭放大样，没想过好好掌握它，结果就无从下手。毛主席说：要打败敌人，首先必须了解敌人；要消灭战争，只有进行战争，用正义战争反对非正义战争。可是，我起初就没有这样看问题，直到走了弯路才使我慢慢明白过来：只有首先掌握放大样，才能最后消灭放大样。从此以后，我到处热心学习放大样的技术和道理，书上的知识也学，老师傅的经验也学，有人说我“入了迷”，以为我认输了，可是我一直憋着劲，一面学科学文化，一面学放样技术，并且把它们结合起来，反复地琢磨、试验。碰到老师傅放样，我不光是看，还根据数学原理作计算，看看对头不对头。对上头了，我的信心更加强；对不上头，我就认真研究为什么。这样钻研的结果，我发现了两方面的问题：一方面是放样本身不很科学，有的地方不如计算出来的准确；另一方面是光靠书本知识也不行，必须学习老师傅丰富的操作经验。就拿屋架岔根的尺寸来说吧，它要用螺丝钉固定，这问题在计算的时候就得考虑进去，不然一紧螺丝钉，加了压力，尺寸就不符合了。我用计算和大样做比较，前后大约十个月，积累了不少成功和失败的经验教训，代替放大样的一套计算方法，终于慢慢摸索出来了。
    去年9月，我们队在人民大会堂工地接受了一项支外檐模板的任务，我正式提出不用放大样，就按计算的数字下料。但是主管技术员坚决不同意，认为不保险，质量检查员也不赞成。有的问我：“弄不好你负得起这份责任吗？”有的还说我：“想露大脸，必现大眼。”这时候，党又给了我有力的支持，要我像毛主席所说的那样，敢作前人没有做过的事情，同时注意多听群众的意见。党的支持壮了我们的胆，我们积极地准备起来了。为了保证不出错，不打无把握之仗，在下料的前一天晚上，我不但一次又一次地用自己创造的公式进行验算，而且在铺板上放了小样来核对，征求了好几位老师傅的意见。深夜两点又和几个队员一起跑到人民英雄纪念碑前面，在石板地上做了几条最重要的斜线，再一次校对了计算出来的数字。经过反复试验全没问题了，第二天，我们就大胆地抛开了放大样的千年常规，把总计六十九立方米的木料截好，搬到屋顶上拼在一起，尺寸完全正确，只用三天时间就完成了原订七天的任务。1956年以来，我就一直想革“鲁班爷”的命，到了1959年，我终于在毛泽东思想的鼓舞、教育下，把这个愿望实现了。不过，起初我那个计算方法，文化低的同志不好学，一位老师傅说：“要是把这个办法简化一下，变成几个数，应用的时候一查就行，那就好了。”这话使我受到了很大启发，我又继续努力，把原来那一套公式，有的变成容易学习的公式，有的干脆作成表格，形成一套木工简易计算法。前些时候，建筑工程出版社已经把这种方法编成小册子出版，只要会加减乘除的工人，全能用它来代替放大样了。
    毛泽东思想就是真理
    两年多以来，我从亲身经验中，深深体会到：毛泽东思想就是真理，这话是千真万确，一点没错的。用毛泽东的战略思想打生产仗、打技术革命的仗，我们也都是无往不胜，无攻不克的。当然，这不是说在战斗的过程中，一点困难、失败都不会发生。毛主席早就说过：我们不能要求事实上的常胜将军，只能要求一般地打胜仗的智勇双全的将军。我们队在生产中碰过的钉子是不少的。不过，我们始终牢牢记住毛主席的教导：失败是成功之母。只要吃一堑能长一智，不吃糊涂亏，那就会把失败变为成功，一个胜利接着又一个胜利。每一次打仗都有很多困难。不过我们始终牢牢记住毛主席的教导：“军事家不能超过物质条件许可的范围外企图战争的胜利，然而军事家可以而且必须在物质条件许可的范围内争取战争的胜利。军事家活动的舞台建筑在客观物质条件的上面，然而军事家凭着这个舞台，却可以导演出许多有声有色威武雄壮的活剧来。”我们完全相信：只要高度地发挥主观能动性，无论条件多么困难，都一定会出色地完成任务，取得最好的成绩。现在，我们全体队员在党的领导下，斗志都很旺盛，我们已经实现了全部操作机械化、半机械化，但是大家并不满足，正在满怀信心地向着联动化进军。我可以向大家保证：今后我们一定更努力地学习毛主席的著作，进一步用毛泽东思想武装起来，在技术革新和技术革命运动中，在实现今年和整个六十年代的持续跃进的伟大斗争中，打出更多的漂亮仗，为社会主义、共产主义作出更大的贡献！
