Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 5th: According to a report by the Indian Press Trust, Indian National Congress President Reddy, speaking at a National Congress Committee meeting on the 4th, repeated the so-called "Chinese aggression" slander, claiming that India "faces a serious problem of Chinese aggression."

Reddy falsely accused China of "occupying more than 12,000 square miles of our (India's) land," and clamored, "This is aggression, there is no doubt about it."

He also shouted, "The Bangalore annual meeting was right, aggression has taken place and aggression must be eliminated."

When discussing how to remedy the internal divisions of the National Congress Party, Reddy incited National Congress Party members to tighten their ranks and build a strong and united organization in order to "not only cope with the challenges of other parties, but also face the dangers from the northern border of India."

In his speech, Reddy also attacked the Communist Party of India, clamoring that "greater efforts and determination must be made to eliminate this (Communist Party) threat."
