    Six Thousand Representatives Share a Common Wish: Everyone Should Establish Lofty Ambitions and Aspirations to Let the Flowers of the Cultural Revolution Bloom All Over China.
    Many Representatives Wrote Letters and Made Phone Calls During the Congress to Transmit Advanced Experiences Back to Their Localities
    (Our dispatch) On June 11th, more than six thousand heroes from the cultural and educational front, with the joy of a rich harvest and excited hearts, received awards from the Party and the state in the brightly lit Great Hall of the People. They solemnly guaranteed to the most beloved Party Central Committee and the great leader Chairman Mao: We will, with the spirit of continuous revolution, muster even greater revolutionary drive and usher in a new high tide of the Cultural Revolution.
    Jin Zhong, a health worker from Urad Front Banner in the Inner Mongolian grasslands, told reporters excitedly that she had been very excited every day during the conference, always thinking about how to perfectly bring back the Party's teachings and everything she had heard and learned inside and outside the conference, so that these advanced seeds could be sown throughout the grasslands. Jin Zhong's words reflected the common wish of all the representatives. They unanimously expressed their intention to bring the advanced experiences they had learned and summarized at this conference back to their respective regions, so that they could blossom and bear fruit in every corner of the country.
    At this conference, which was filled with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, the representatives once again received a profound education in Mao Zedong Thought. They will hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, return to their posts, and create even greater achievements in the Cultural Revolution. Li Ruihuan, leader of the youth shock brigade of the Beijing Third Construction Company, said that he had deeply realized from countless facts that Mao Zedong Thought is the truth. They have always been invincible in construction by fighting production battles and technological revolution battles with Mao Zedong's strategic thinking; they are also invincible in fighting cultural revolution battles with Mao Zedong Thought. He told the representatives at the conference that in the future, he would work harder to study Chairman Mao's works, further arm himself with Mao Zedong Thought, and fight bigger and more beautiful battles in the technological revolution and cultural revolution, and in the great struggle of the continuous leap forward in the entire 1960s. Representatives from the literary and art circles expressed that they would use various forms of literary and artistic works to spread Mao Zedong Thought to the broad masses of people. Film director Xie Tian said that he would hold higher the red banner of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, so that the film industry could leap forward again and again. Representatives from the press unanimously stated that they would take the dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought as their most glorious and important task.
    More than three thousand nine hundred heroes from the education front enthusiastically responded to the Party's call and put forward a resounding slogan: Always be promoters of the education revolution! Both older and younger teachers exchanged their various experiences in teaching reform during the conference, learning from and encouraging each other.
    Lobsang Tsering, from a private primary school in Linzhi County, Tibet, had been a servant for serf owners for decades. After being liberated, he became a primary school teacher and also served as the leader of the teaching and research group for private primary school teachers in three townships. He usually carried zanba and traversed mountains and rivers, achieving great results. Now, he said: This conference has given me a lot of education and inspiration. I must bring the spirit of the conference and the advanced experiences of education work in various regions and among various ethnic groups back to Tibet and resolutely implement them in light of the specific conditions of Tibet. There are also advanced units like Xujiazhuang Agricultural Middle School in Hengshui County, Hebei Province, who have even greater ambitions and higher aspirations. This school has been established for less than two years, but it has already ranked first in the unified examinations for ordinary middle schools and agricultural middle schools in the county in terms of teaching, and its production labor is doing very well, and it has also made great achievements in scientific and technological research. Now, Li Zhanzhong, the representative of this school, put forward a new slogan at the conference: "Oppose right-leaning, encourage vigor, establish lofty ambitions, set great aspirations, learn from Fujian, catch up with Jiangsu, continuously revolutionize, advance victoriously, strive for first place in the province, and strive for excellence in the country." The representatives of Pingyuan County in Shandong Province and Wanrong County in Shanxi Province, which have become national red flags in the work of popularizing phonetic literacy and eliminating illiteracy, often visited each other and exchanged experiences during the conference. They said that after returning from this "pilgrimage," they would launch a friendly competition with each other to hold the red flag even higher.
    Many representatives not only "learned from the scriptures" from various places inside and outside the conference, but also transmitted these "scriptures" back to their localities. The Guangxi delegation told Guangxi Normal College about the news of the education-related exhibition held during the conference. President Zhang Rongying immediately took more than 30 teachers to Beijing to visit. They also planned to go to Peking University and Tsinghua University to learn from their experiences. Yi Yaowen, the representative of Jishan County, Shanxi Province, the red flag of the national rural health campaign, and the first secretary of the Jishan County Party Committee, wrote letters, made phone calls, and sent telegrams back to the county during the heroes' meeting to convey the spirit of the conference in a timely and concise manner. He said that the county party committee has now made a plan to organize 350,000 people in the county to widely and deeply study the main documents of the conference, and to continue to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution in the field of health campaigns to improve the efficiency and quality of health work.
    Eleven days ago, more than six thousand representatives came to the capital from all corners of the motherland with red hearts to pay tribute to the Party; today, they are bringing back the fruits of the rich harvest from participating in the conference for eleven days, determined to set off an even higher and greater revolutionary wave, letting the flowers of the Cultural Revolution bloom in every corner of the motherland.

    六千代表一个心愿　人人树立雄心大志
    让文化革命花朵开遍全中国
    许多代表在大会期间写信、打电话把先进经验传回本地
    本报讯　6月11日，六千多名文教战线的英雄们，怀着丰收的喜悦和激动的心情，在灯光辉煌的人民大会堂里，接受了党和国家的奖励。他们庄严地向最敬爱的党中央和伟大领袖毛主席保证：我们要以不断革命的精神，鼓起更大的革命干劲，掀起文化革命的新高潮。
    来自内蒙古草原上乌拉特前旗的保健员金钟，激动地对记者说，她在参加大会期间，每天都很兴奋，总是在想：怎样把党的教导和会内会外听到、学到的一切，完满地带回去，让这些先进的种籽撒遍整个草原。金钟的这些话，反映了全体代表的共同心愿。他们一致表示要把在这次大会上学到的和总结起来的先进经验，带回各地去，在全国各个角落开花结果。
    在这个充满着毛泽东思想光辉的大会上，代表们又一次受到了毛泽东思想的深刻教育。他们将高举着毛泽东思想红旗，回到自己的岗位，创造更大的文化革命硕果。北京市第三建筑公司青年突击队长李瑞环说，他从无数事实中深深体会到，毛泽东思想就是真理。他们在建设事业中，用毛泽东的战略思想打生产仗，打技术革命仗，一向战无不胜；用毛泽东思想打文化革命仗，也是攻无不克。他在大会上向代表们表示，今后要更加努力学习毛主席的著作，进一步用毛泽东思想把自己武装起来，在技术革命和文化革命中，在整个六十年代的持续跃进的伟大斗争中，打更大更漂亮的仗。文艺界的代表们表示，要以各种形式的文艺作品，把毛泽东思想传播给广大人民。电影导演谢添说，要更高地举起毛泽东文艺思想的红旗，让电影事业跃进，再跃进。新闻界的代表一致表示，要把宣传毛泽东思想，作为自己最光荣最重要的任务。
    教育战线上三千九百多名英雄们，热烈响应党的号召，提出了响亮的口号：永远做教育革命的促进派！年老的、年轻的教师们，都在会议期间交流了他们在教学改革中的各种经验，互相学习，互相鼓励。
    从西藏林芝县民办小学来的洛桑次仁，他过去为农奴主当佣人做了几十年牛马，翻身后当了小学教师，又担任三个乡的民办小学教师教学研究组的小组长，平常背着糌粑，翻山涉水，取得了很大成绩；现在，他说：这次大会使我受到了很多教育与启发，我一定要把大会的精神和各地区各兄弟民族教育工作方面的先进经验带回西藏，结合西藏的具体情况坚决予以贯彻。还有像河北省衡水县徐家庄农业中学这样的先进单位，他们的心更雄，志更大。这个学校成立还不到二年，但在教学上在全县普通中学、农业中学统一考试中已名列第一，生产劳动搞得很好，科学技术研究也取得了很大成绩；现在，这个学校的代表李展中在会上提出了新的口号：“反右倾，鼓干劲，树雄心，立大志，学福建，赶江苏，不断革命，乘胜前进，在全省争第一，全国争上游”。在推广注音识字、扫除文盲工作中成为全国红旗的山东省平原县和山西省万荣县的代表，在大会期间，经常互相访问，交流经验，他们表示在这次“取经”回去后，要互相展开友谊竞赛，把红旗举得更高。
    许多代表一面在会内会外向各地“取经”，一面就把这些“经”传回本地。广西代表团把会议期间举行有关教育的展览会消息告诉广西师范学院，院长张荣莹听了马上带着三十多个教师到北京来参观，他们还打算去北京大学、清华大学取经。全国农村卫生运动的红旗——山西省稷山县的代表、中共稷山县委第一书记仪耀文在群英会期间，接连写信、打电话、发电报回去，及时地、简要地传达了大会的精神。他说，现在县委已经订了计划，要组织全县三十五万人民群众广泛深刻地学习大会的主要文件，在卫生运动方面继续开展技术革新和技术革命，提高卫生工作的效率和质量。
    十一天前，六千多位代表带了颗颗红心从祖国的四面八方来到首都，向党献礼；今天他们又要把十一天来参加大会中丰收的果实带回去，决心掀起更高更大的革命巨浪，让文化革命的鲜花开在祖国的各个角落。（附图片）
