    I Became an Electric Tricycle Driver
    Du Wanjun, Worker of the 7th Transportation Team, Heping District Transportation Company, Shenyang City
    April 21st was the most unforgettable day of my life. From that day on, I threw away the human-powered tricycle I had pedaled for over twenty years and drove an electric tricycle freight vehicle with ease and joy. Something I couldn't even dream of in the past, today, under the leadership of the Communist Party, we have achieved it with our own hands.
    The night before, the leaders decided to assign me one of the first batch of electric tricycle freight vehicles that we modified ourselves. I was so happy that I didn't sleep all night. The next morning, before five o'clock, I ran to the team headquarters. Under the guidance of the technicians, I sat in this beloved vehicle for the first time and started learning to drive. It didn't take half a day to learn. When I got home from work that day, as soon as I entered the door, my youngest son clapped his little hands and shouted, "Daddy drives an electric car!" My wife was also happy to ask me all sorts of questions. Looking at the family's excitement and thinking about the different lives in the old and new societies, I was so moved that I shed tears.
    From the moment our transportation team proposed building electric vehicles, we a group of tricycle workers were overjoyed. Some people even said, "We have been pulling carts for decades, now it is time to let the carts pull us." To convert the human-powered tricycles into electric vehicles, we needed to add some parts, and there was a shortage of materials, so everyone took out the scrap metal from their homes. After finishing my work every day, I ran to the technical innovation factory of the transportation team and worked with everyone to modify the electric vehicles. I thought, "Although I don't understand technology, I can always do some physical labor. We must liberate ourselves with our own hands. If we put in an extra effort today, we will save ten times the effort tomorrow; if we sweat one more drop today, we will transport one more ton of goods tomorrow."
    Now, I drive an electric car every day, hauling all kinds of industrial raw materials and daily necessities on the wide roads, and my heart is really beautiful, indescribably happy. Once, I was carrying goods and passing in front of Nanhu Park when I met an acquaintance, Old Zhang. He saw me driving an electric car, stopped me, and said, "Old Du, this is great! You've become a driver!" I also said with a smile, "I won't need you to push your bicycle behind me when I deliver goods to you in the future. Let's race to see who runs faster!" After this month or so, I deeply feel that electric vehicles are really good! Not only do they save effort, but also the transportation efficiency is much higher. In the past, I used a human-powered tricycle to transport 200 kilograms of goods from Shanshan to Nanhu, a distance of five kilometers, and I could only transport it four times a day; now I use an electric tricycle to transport 400 kilograms of goods, and I can pull eight trips a day over the same distance. The problem of insufficient transportation capacity can be better solved. Since driving an electric car, my life has also changed a lot. I have more time to study politics and culture after work every day, and I have more energy and time to watch movies and plays.
    This great liberation of our physical labor is the result of the Party leading us to make great efforts in technical innovation and technical revolution. In order to repay the Party's concern, I am determined to be an excellent electric vehicle driver and better complete the transportation tasks.

    我当上了电瓶三轮车司机
    沈阳市和平区运输公司第七运输队工人　杜万君
    4月21日，是我一生中最难忘的一天。从那天起，我扔掉蹬了二十多年的人力三轮车，轻松愉快地驾驶上电瓶三轮货车。过去做梦都想不到的事，今天，共产党又领导着我们依靠自己的双手实现了。
    头天晚上，领导决定从我们自己改装出的第一批电瓶三轮货车当中，分配一台由我驾驶，我高兴得一宿都没有睡着。第二天清早，没到五点钟我就跑到队部。在技术工人指导下，我第一次坐在这辆心爱的车子上，开始学驾驶。没用半天工夫就学会了。当天下班回家，一进门，我的小儿子就冲我拍着小手喊着：“爸爸开电瓶车啦！”我的爱人也高兴地向我问长问短。看着全家人这股喜欢劲，想想新旧社会的不同生活，我激动得流出了眼泪。
    从打我们运输队提出大造电瓶车以后，我们一群三轮车工人就乐得不得了。有的人还说：“过去咱们拉了几十年车，现在也该让车拉拉咱们了。”把人力三轮车改成电瓶车，要增加一些零件，缺少材料，大家就把家里的破钢烂铁都拿了出来。我每天拉完活，就跑到运输队的技术革新工厂里，跟大伙一起改装电瓶车。我想：“虽然我不懂技术，干点力气活总是可以的。我们要用自己的双手解放自己。今天多花一分劲，明天就省十分劲；今天多滴一滴汗，明天就多运一吨货。”
    现在，我每天开着电瓶车，拉着各种工业原料、日用百货奔驰在宽阔的马路上，心里真是美滋滋的，说不出来的高兴。有一次，我拉着货从南湖公园前面经过，碰到了一位熟识的顾客老张。他看见我开着电瓶车，把我喊住，对我说：“老杜，这回可好啦！当上司机了！”我也笑着说：“以后再给你们运货不用你推着自行车跟着走了。咱们赛赛看谁跑得快吧！”经过这一个来月，我深深感到电瓶车确实是好！不但省力气，运输效率也高多了。过去我用人力三轮车运二百公斤货物，由砂山到南湖，五公里远，一天只能运四次；现在用电瓶三轮车运四百公斤货物，在同样距离内，一天能拉八趟。运力不足的问题可以更好地解决了。自从驾驶电瓶车以后，我的生活也起了很大变化。每天下班后有了更多时间学习政治、文化，想看看电影看看戏也更有精力和时间了。
    我们这一次体力劳动大解放，是党领导我们大闹技术革新和技术革命的结果。为了报答党的关怀，我决心做一名优秀的电瓶车驾驶员，更好地完成运输任务。
