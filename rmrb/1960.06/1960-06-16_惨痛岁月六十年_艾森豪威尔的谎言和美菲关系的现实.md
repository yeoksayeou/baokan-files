Sixty Years of Bitter Years
Eisenhower's Lies and the Reality of US-Philippine Relations
Luo Erzhuang

President Eisenhower's plane landed at Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines on June 14. Eisenhower finally set foot on Philippine soil, beginning his three-day visit to the Philippines. According to the Associated Press, at the very moment the American president "arrived" in the Philippines, the island nation in the Pacific was covered in dark clouds and light rain. Even if this is a coincidence, the gloom perfectly symbolizes the meaning of the American president's "friendly visit."

In a statement issued on the eve of his visit to the Far East, Eisenhower said that he was visiting the Philippines because the United States and the Philippines "have had the closest ties since sixty years ago" and because the United States wanted to "help a developing nation achieve prosperous independence." Upon arriving at Manila Airport, the capital of the Philippines, he tirelessly promoted the idea that the United States wanted to be a "true partner" of the Philippines and to be "friends" with the Philippines forever. Eisenhower hoped to wear this cloak made of lies to deceive and appease the dissatisfaction of the Filipino people with American imperialism. However, all awakened Filipino people who have personally experienced American "friendship" are fully capable of seeing through: Eisenhower is actually just a Big Bad Wolf from across the ocean.

What kind of "relationship" is this "close relationship that began sixty years ago"? What kind of friendship is the US-Philippine "friendship" that Eisenhower repeatedly sings about? Of course, people will not forget. In 1898, the United States, a rising imperialist country, seized the Philippines from Spanish colonialists amid the roar of artillery fire. In the years that followed, it also used bloodshed to drown the Filipino people's heroic resistance to American colonialism. At that time, the United States also hypocritically said that it was helping the Philippines to achieve "independence." However, for forty-eight long years, until 1946, when the United States was forced to declare the Philippines "independent" in name, the United States implemented its colonial rule in the Philippines one hundred percent. The cruel exploitation, plunder, enslavement, and oppression of colonialism enriched the tycoons of Wall Street, but brought indescribable disasters and suffering to the Filipino people. Needless to say, the "closest ties" in Eisenhower's mouth are actually just the relationship between the colonial oppressor and the colonized oppressed people.

Take the situation after 1946, when the United States was forced to declare the Philippines "independent"! In fact, after the "independence" of the Philippines, the United States still controlled the lifeline of all aspects of it with new colonialist methods. Economically, the United States forced the Philippines to add the so-called "Equal Rights Amendment" to its constitution, which opened the door for Americans to continue plundering Philippine natural resources. The United States enjoys the same rights as Filipinos to exploit natural resources and operate public utilities in the Philippines, and to maintain the assets it had occupied during the colonial rule. The so-called US-Philippine "trade agreement" guarantees that the United States can dump its goods into the Philippines without restriction, and unilaterally restrict, depress prices, and discriminate against Philippine goods. Through the so-called "US-Philippine Military Base Agreement," "US-Philippine Military Assistance Agreement," and "US-Philippine Mutual Defense Treaty," etc., the sovereignty of the Philippines has been severely damaged politically. American military bases have not only become a source of war that could plunge the Philippines into disaster at any time, but also a "country within a country" where American troops smuggle, commit murder, and commit crimes. Even American troops can arbitrarily kill local Filipinos, and the Philippines has no right to intervene. Every year, the Philippines not only has to painstakingly spend a huge amount of 1.1 million pesos to support American military "advisors," but its army is also under strict American control. The Philippines was also dragged into the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc pieced together by the United States. In terms of diplomacy, the Philippines is almost forced to follow the United States' lead in everything, and is even called an American "rubber stamp." The above-mentioned US-Philippine "friendship" relations have brought endless suffering to the Filipino people. The Philippine national economy has suffered serious damage, and there is a huge trade deficit of about 200 million US dollars every year; the national financial economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, and government budgets and deficits are increasing almost every year. Due to the frequent impact of the American economic crisis, many factories have been shut down. In a country with only 24 million people, the number of unemployed people often reaches as high as 2 million. Not only that, since the independence of the Philippines, the United States has been playing rogue, trying every means to evade the wartime losses and other compensation it should pay to the Philippines. At the same time, the United States stubbornly and repeatedly refused to revise the "trade agreement" and military base agreements, which seriously damage Philippine sovereignty and interests, as requested by the Philippines. The United States not only maintains its colonial interests in the Philippines in all aspects such as economy and politics, but also always regards itself as the master in its dealings with the Philippines, displaying an extremely arrogant attitude. It is somewhat ironic to say that even ten years after the Philippines declared its independence, the United States has refused to hand over the title deed of the Philippine Presidential Palace, Malacañang Palace, to the Philippines. This is such a typical robber attitude. No wonder the "Manila Chronicle" once angrily accused in 1958 that the ownership of the Philippine Presidential Palace, Malacañang Palace, is still technically in the hands of the United States. Isn't this an extremely sharp irony to the so-called American "respect" for the "independence" of the Philippines?

Admittedly, Eisenhower was honest about the timing when he sang about the "closest ties" between the United States and the Philippines. Indeed, it's been "sixty years." This is a long time, but it is by no means the "friendly" years of the so-called "true partners" of the Eisenhower clique, but the painful years of the Filipino people suffering from the despicable and shameless oppression and plunder of American imperialism. The awakened Filipinos not only see through the essence of the problems they face through the guise of "independence" "bestowed" by the United States, but also increasingly deeply realize that only by smashing the new colonial chains that the United States still puts around their necks can they obtain true independence and freedom. In recent years, especially since 1959, the anti-American voices in the Philippines have not only been rising, but have also increasingly swept across all levels except the extreme pro-American faction. Prominent Philippine Senator Recto pointed out last year that the Philippine Declaration of Independence issued and read by Americans was "a document like a state document of the United States, which showed the mind of American imperialism." He said that even after the Philippines had achieved political independence, it was still bound by relevant laws of the US Congress. He compared the Philippines to a family that owns its own home but must obey the orders of outsiders in the house. He directly denounced the United States as an aggressor. These words basically point out the essence of US-Philippine relations. Prominent Philippine economist Lava also pointed out that the US-Philippine "trade agreement" and the "Bell Trade Act" actually reduced Filipinos to second-class citizens in their own country. Regarding the so-called loans from the United States, Congressman Sousa once pointed out sharply that it was a thick rope around the neck of the Philippines. Even in the Philippine Congress, last year was full of anti-American voices. At the same time, the general public and public opinion were even more indignant, and anti-American demonstrations have been constantly occurring. As Senator Recto said, the Americans can be told that Philippine nationalism is not the emotion of a few people, but almost the emotion of the entire people.

The storm in US-Philippine relations that began to emerge last year shocked the gentlemen in Washington. It is precisely because of this situation, as well as the military aggression activities that the United States has stepped up around the world before and after undermining the summit conference, that Eisenhower had to travel long distances to "visit" the Philippines in person. In short, easing anti-American sentiment in the Philippines, stabilizing American control over the Philippines, maintaining American positions in the Western Pacific, and conspiring to step up the deployment of atomic missiles in the Philippines are the sinister main purposes of Eisenhower's visit to the Philippines. Because of this, while he arrived at Manila Airport and loudly talked about "friendship," he could not help but admit stutteringly: "Between us, as often happens between members of a family, there are some issues that need to be discussed, talked about, and negotiated." He also wanted the Philippines to show "dedication" and not to "separate" from the United States because of "any minor differences."

Let Eisenhower go ahead and talk nonsense about "friendship" and the so-called "closest ties that began sixty years ago"! Let him fabricate whatever he wants, that his "visit" is to "accelerate the realization of helping a developing nation to achieve prosperous independence," and put on that "famous smile" that the United Press International specifically promoted! A thousand lies cannot cover up any living facts. The Filipino people will one day thoroughly settle accounts with American imperialism. People have already seen from the United Press International's reports that even though the Philippine authorities have gone to great lengths to operate the scene of "welcoming" Eisenhower in order to please the United States, at this time, in front of Eisenhower, there appeared "We don't want friendship with conditions," "We want economic independence," "The United States pays our compensation claims" and other anti-American slogans. Could it be said that this scene that appeared under such circumstances does not reflect the true emotions of the Filipino people?

An American reporter once lamented last year about the fierce rise of the anti-American wave in the Philippines that "the honeymoon between the United States and the Philippines is over." Although, in the sixty years of US-Philippine relations, the Philippines has never received any "sweetness," but on the other hand, the United States, this capitalist imperialist rogue, has done all the bad things in the Philippines. With its evil deeds full, its so-called "friendship" relationship with the Philippines is nearing its end. This is something that Eisenhower and his ilk cannot salvage no matter how much sweet talk they say.

    惨痛岁月六十年
    艾森豪威尔的谎言和美菲关系的现实
    罗尔庄
    美国总统艾森豪威尔的座机在6月14日在菲律宾的克拉克空军基地着陆了。艾森豪威尔终于踏上了菲律宾的国土，开始了他为时三天的对菲访问。据美联社报道，恰在这位美国总统“莅临”菲律宾的一刹那，这个太平洋上的岛国乌云密布，细雨霏霏。纵使这是巧合吧，但是一片阴霾，却正好为这位美国总统的“友好访问”底含义做出了象征性注脚。
    艾森豪威尔在他这次出访远东前夕发表的声明中说，他之所以访问菲律宾，是因为美国同菲律宾“有着从六十年以前就开始的最密切的联系”，是因为美国要“帮助一个正在发展中的民族来取得繁荣的独立”。在到达菲律宾首都马尼拉机场的时候，他又不厌其烦地宣扬美国要做菲律宾的“真正的伙伴”，要与菲律宾永远做“朋友”。艾森豪威尔指望披着这件谎言缀成的外衣，招摇撞骗，并缓和菲律宾人民对美帝国主义的不满。但是，一切对美国“友谊”有着切身体会的觉醒了的菲律宾人民，是完全能够看透：艾森豪威尔实际上只不过是一只从大洋彼岸闯来的狼外婆。
    “六十年以前就开始的密切联系”，到底是怎样的一种“联系”呢？艾森豪威尔一再高唱的美菲“友谊”，又是一种什么样的友谊呢？当然，人们是不会健忘的。1898年，美国这个后起的帝国主义国家，是在隆隆的炮声中从西班牙殖民者手中夺取了菲律宾的。在其后的年月里，它还以血泊来淹没过菲律宾人民对于美国殖民主义的英勇反抗。那时候，美国也曾假惺惺地说，这是为帮助菲律宾争取“独立”。但是，直到1946年美国被迫不得不在名义上宣布给予菲律宾“独立”时为止，在漫长的四十八年中，美国百分之百地在菲律宾推行着它的殖民统治。殖民主义残酷的剥削、掠夺、奴役、压迫，养肥了华尔街的大亨，但却使菲律宾人民遭受到难以形容的灾难和痛苦。不言而喻，艾森豪威尔口中的“最密切的联系”，实际上只不过是殖民主义压迫者与殖民地被压迫人民之间的关系。
    就以1946年美国被迫宣布给予菲律宾“独立”之后的情况看吧！实际上，在菲律宾的“独立”以后，美国仍然以新的殖民主义的手法控制着它各个方面的命脉。在经济上，美国迫使菲律宾在宪法中附加的所谓“平等权利法案”，为美国人打开了继续掠夺菲律宾天然资源的方便大门。美国在菲律宾享有与菲律宾人同等的开采自然资源和经营公用事业的权利，和保持其在殖民统治时期就已占有的资产。所谓美菲“贸易协定”，保证了美国能够无限制地向菲律宾倾销它的商品，单方面地对菲律宾的货物实行限制、压价与歧视。通过所谓“美菲军事基地协定”、“美菲军事援助协定”、“美菲联防条约”等，在政治上，使菲律宾的主权遭到极其严重的损害。美国军事基地不仅成为随时有可能把菲律宾推向战争灾祸的根源，而且还成为美军偷私漏税，杀人行凶，为非作歹的“国中之国”，甚至美军可以任意杀死当地的菲律宾人，菲律宾也无权过问与干涉。菲律宾每年不仅要吃力地以一百一十万比索的巨额经费供养美国的军事“顾问”，并且，它的军队也受着美国的严格控制。菲律宾并被拖进美国一手拼凑的东南亚侵略集团。在外交方面，菲律宾也几乎处处被迫唯美国马首是瞻，以至被人称为美国的一个“橡皮图章”。以上种种美菲“友谊”关系，给菲律宾人民带来无穷无尽的苦难。菲律宾民族经济遭到了严重的损害，对外贸易每年大约出现二亿美元左右的巨额逆差；国家财政经济濒于破产，政府预算和赤字几乎年年激增。由于经常受到美国经济危机的冲击，许多工厂停工倒闭了。在一个仅有二千四百万人口的国家，失业人数竟然经常高达二百万。不仅如此，在菲律宾独立以来，美国就一直耍无赖，千方百计地企图逃避它应该偿付给菲律宾的战时损失等项赔偿。同时，美国顽固地一再拒绝按照菲律宾的要求，修改严重损害菲律宾主权和利益的“贸易协定”及军事基地等协定。美国不仅在经济、政治等各个方面对菲律宾保持着它的殖民利益，而且在与菲律宾的交往中，从来都以主子自居，摆出极其傲慢骄横的态度。说来这多少是带有讽刺意味的：甚至在菲律宾宣布独立之后十年，美国还一直不肯把菲律宾总统府马拉坎南宫的地契交给菲律宾。这是多么典型的强盗态度。无怪乎“马尼拉纪事报”曾经在1958年愤慨地指责，菲律宾总统府马拉坎南宫的所有权在技术上说仍然在美国手里。难道说，这对于所谓美国“尊重”菲律宾的“独立”，还不是一个极其尖锐的讽刺吗？
    诚然，艾森豪威尔高唱美菲之间“最密切的联系”时，在对时间的计算这一点上还是诚实的。的确，“六十年”了。这是一个漫长的岁月，但决不是艾森豪威尔之流所谓“真正的伙伴”的“友好”岁月，而是菲律宾人民遭受着美帝国主义卑鄙无耻地压迫、掠夺的痛苦岁月。觉醒了的菲律宾人不仅透过美国“恩施”的“独立”的外衣，看到他们面临的问题的实质，并且日益深刻地认识，只有粉碎美国仍然套在他们脖子上的新殖民主义的锁链，他们才能获得真正的独立自由。连年来，特别是自1959年以来，在菲律宾响起的反美声浪，不仅日益高涨，并且日益广泛地席卷了除极端亲美派之外的各个阶层。菲律宾著名参议员雷克托在去年指出过，由美国人颁布和宣读的菲律宾独立宣言是“一项像美国一个州的文件，它表明了美帝国主义的心意”。他说，菲律宾即使在它取得了政治上的独立以后，也仍然受美国国会有关法令的约束。他把菲律宾比作这样的一个家庭：他们拥有自己的家园，然而却必须听从屋里的外来者的命令。他直截了当地斥责美国是侵略者。这些话，基本上指出了美菲关系的实质。菲律宾著名经济学家拉瓦也指出，美菲“贸易协定”和“贝尔贸易法”实际上使菲律宾人在自己国土上降到二等公民的地位。对于美国的所谓贷款，众议员索萨曾一针见血地指出过，它是套在菲律宾脖子上的一根粗绳。甚至在菲律宾国会，去年也都充满反美呼声。与此同时，广大人民和舆论界更是群情激愤，反美示威游行，曾经不断发生。正如参议员雷克托所说，可以告诉美国人，菲律宾的民族主义不是少数人的情绪，而几乎是全国人民的情绪。
    从去年开始出现的美菲两国关系上的风雨，震动了华盛顿的老爷们。正是由于这种情况，以及美国在破坏首脑会议前后竭力在世界各地加紧的军事侵略活动，促使艾森豪威尔不得不仆仆风尘，远涉重洋，亲自“访问”菲律宾。总之，缓和菲律宾的反美情绪，稳定美国对菲律宾的控制，保住美国在西太平洋的阵地，以及阴谋加紧在菲律宾设置原子导弹，就是艾森豪威尔这次出访菲律宾的阴险的主要目的。正因这样，在他到达马尼拉机场，放声高谈“友好”的同时，也不能不吞吞吐吐地承认：“在我们之间，犹如一个家庭的成员之间常有的一样，有一些问题需要讨论，需要交谈，需要谈判。”他并要菲律宾表现出“献身精神”，和不要因为“任何一种微小的分歧”而与美国“分开”。
    让艾森豪威尔去瞎说什么“友好”和所谓“六十年以前就开始的最密切的联系”吧！让他胡诌什么他这次“访问”是为了“加速实现帮助一个正在发展中的民族来取得繁荣的独立”，和装出那副为合众国际社所特别加以宣扬的“著名的笑容”吧！千句谎言，都掩盖不了任何一点活生生的事实。菲律宾人民总有一天，会彻底地向美帝国主义算账的。人们从合众国际社的报道中已经看到，即使菲律宾当局为了讨好美国，煞费苦心去经营“欢迎”艾森豪威尔的场面，但是，正在这个时候，在艾森豪威尔面前，却出现了“我们不要附有条件的友谊”，“我们要经济独立”，“美国偿还我们的赔偿要求”等反美标语牌。难道说，在这种情况下出现的这种场面，不正反映了菲律宾人民的真正情绪吗？
    美国一位记者去年曾经就菲律宾反美浪潮的猛烈兴起而哀叹“美菲两国的蜜月已经过去了”。虽然，在六十年的美菲关系中，菲律宾从来没有领受过任何“甜蜜”，但另方面，美国这个资本帝国主义恶棍已在菲律宾做尽了坏事。恶贯满盈，它同菲律宾的所谓“友谊”关系已经接近宣告终结的时候了。这是艾森豪威尔之流无论说多少甜言蜜语也无法挽回的。
