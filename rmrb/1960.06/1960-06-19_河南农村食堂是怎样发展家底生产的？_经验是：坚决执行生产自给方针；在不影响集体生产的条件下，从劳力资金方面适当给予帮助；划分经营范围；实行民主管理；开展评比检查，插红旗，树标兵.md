Most canteens in Henan Province have built vegetable bases, livestock farms, fish ponds, as well as flour mills, tofu workshops, pickle gardens, and other small workshops. As a result, the canteens have achieved diversified meals. Last year, the autumn vegetable harvest from the province's canteen vegetable bases was over 50 billion jin, averaging over 1,000 jin per person, and they also mobilized the collection of various dried vegetables. Sufficient vegetables not only improved the lives of commune members but also saved grain. In some places, canteens used the money from family production to carry out restaurant and other basic construction.

Canteens actively develop family production, canteens are getting better and better, and the broad masses of commune members love the canteens even more.

Henan Province has mastered the following principles in developing family production in canteens:

First, resolutely implement the policy of self-sufficiency in production. The purpose of developing family production is to improve and raise the living standards of commune members. If there is a surplus in family production, it can be sold to state commercial departments. Under the current circumstances, canteen pig raising must still sell a portion to the state according to state plans. At the same time, this part of production should be actively strengthened in leadership and vigorously developed, but it cannot affect and weaken the production of pig farms in production brigades and production teams.

Second, managing family production mainly relies on the spare time of cooks and managers or the labor saved after cooking equipment reforms. However, production teams can also organize some auxiliary labor to help production when necessary. Some public canteens sometimes organize commune members to do a small amount of voluntary labor before and after meals, which is also permissible. The funds for managing family production are mainly solved by the canteen through self-reliance. Production brigades or production teams should lend a small amount of funds to canteens with difficulties to help them develop family production smoothly. The feed for raising livestock and poultry mainly relies on the canteen to solve itself. If it is insufficient, commune members can also be mobilized to help collect some leaves and weeds. On the premise of ensuring that commune members have enough vegetables to eat, a portion of vegetable land can also be used to plant feed.

Third, the scope of family production is mainly: operating vegetables to ensure that commune members have enough vegetables to eat throughout the year. Raising livestock and poultry such as pigs, sheep, chickens, and ducks, developing production such as raising rabbits and bees, and those with conditions can also raise dairy cows and dairy goats; fully utilizing pits and ponds to raise fish and plant lotus roots, utilizing idle land to cultivate Chinese toon, prickly ash, fennel, and daylilies; establishing self-sufficient flour mills, tofu workshops, pickle gardens and other small workshops, pickling various pickles, making tofu, bean sprouts, vermicelli, etc., and carrying out non-staple food processing and condiment production.

Fourth, developing family production in public canteens is an important part of building and improving public canteens. The management of family production should be closely integrated with the entire canteen management. In the process of developing family production in canteens in Henan Province, most canteens adopt the democratic management method: under the leadership of the production team's party branch and team affairs committee, the members' living representative meeting or the members' congress discusses and formulates the plan for developing family production and the plan for income and expenditure, etc. The canteen management committee is responsible for specific work and establishes financial, storage, and other systems. Accounts are cleared daily and settled monthly, and published regularly. Generally, they have made it so that the canteen's family production and all the property of the production team are managed separately, with separate accounts and separate management. Strictly implement warehousing procedures to ensure that there are vouchers for entry and exit, and procedures for withdrawals. Specific regulations have also been made for the use of family production, mainly: improving the lives of commune members; solving expenses such as oil, salt, condiments, and fuel; expanding investment in family production; adding and repairing canteen cooking utensils; repairing restaurant utensils; and drawing a certain percentage as bonuses for those participating in family production. Some have also established a "three guarantees and one reward" method, that is, guaranteeing quantity, guaranteeing work, guaranteeing income, and rewarding for exceeding the quota. The establishment of the above system ensures the healthy development of family production.

Fifth, carrying out major inspections, major evaluations, planting red flags, and establishing models, and timely summarizing and exchanging advanced experience has played a huge role in the development of family production. When Ruyang County developed family production in canteens, it carried out evaluation competitions throughout the county based on the conditions of "six comparisons and six observations." The "six comparisons and six observations" are: comparing high ideological awareness, and observing the development of family production being abundant, fast, good, and economical; comparing strengthening leadership, and observing the catering management personnel being enthusiastic about family production; comparing the rapid development and good quality of livestock and poultry, and observing the canteen's income being large; comparing feeding management, and observing the healthy development of livestock and poultry; comparing the management of vegetable production, and observing the quantity of vegetable income; comparing the completeness of the establishment of various workshops, and observing the abundance of non-staple foods processed by the canteen. Through evaluation and competition, everyone's enthusiasm was boosted, and the county quickly realized pig raising, vegetable planting, and the establishment of self-sufficient small workshops in every canteen. Baihe Commune in Mengjin County adopted the method of holding on-site meetings with selected points to promote the development of family production. This commune focused on Baihe and Qili brigades, and successively held four on-site meetings to promote the experience of comprehensive utilization of persimmon processing. In five days, the entire commune made 150,000 jin of persimmon sauce, vinegar, and other condiments. At the same time, many places also used the method of half-monthly inspections, monthly evaluations, and regular rewards to promote the continuous development and improvement of family production.

    河南农村食堂是怎样发展家底生产的？
    经验是：坚决执行生产自给方针；在不影响集体生产的条件下，从劳力资金方面适当给予帮助；划分经营范围；实行民主管理；开展评比检查，插红旗，树标兵
    ＊中共河南省委农村部＊
    河南省绝大部分食堂都建有蔬菜基地、畜牧场、鱼塘，以及粉坊、豆腐坊、酱菜园等各种小作坊。因而，食堂已做到了饭菜多样化。去年全省食堂蔬菜基地收获的秋菜有五百余亿斤，每人平均千斤以上，另外又发动了采集各种干菜。蔬菜充足，不仅改善了社员生活，而且还节约了粮食。有些地方的食堂用家底生产的钱，进行了餐厅及其他基本建设。
    食堂积极发展家底生产，食堂越办越好，广大社员更加热爱食堂。
    河南省在发展食堂家底生产中掌握以下几条原则：
    第一，坚决执行生产自给方针。发展家底生产的目的是改善和提高社员的生活。家底生产如有多余时可以卖给国家商业部门。在目前情况下食堂的养猪还必须根据国家计划出售给国家一部分。同时，这部分生产应当积极加强领导，大力发展，但不能影响和削弱生产大队、生产队猪场的生产。
    第二，经营家底生产，主要依靠炊管人员业余时间或炊具改革后节省的劳力。但生产队在必要时也可以组织一些辅助劳力来帮助生产。有些公共食堂有时组织社员饭前、饭后进行少量的义务劳动的办法也是可以的。经营家底生产的经费以食堂自力更生解决为主，对有困难的食堂，生产大队或生产队应当借给少量的资金帮助他们顺利发展家底生产。饲养家畜家禽的饲料，主要依靠食堂自己解决，不足时也可以发动社员帮助采集一些树叶、杂草。在保证社员蔬菜够吃的前提下，也可以抽一部分菜地种植饲料。
    第三，家底生产的经营范围主要是：经营蔬菜，保证社员一年四季都有足够的蔬菜吃。饲养猪、羊、鸡、鸭等家畜家禽，发展养兔、养蜂等生产，有条件的还可以饲养奶牛、奶羊；充分利用坑塘养鱼、种藕，利用空闲地栽培香椿、花椒、茴香和黄花菜等；建立自给性的粉坊、豆腐坊、酱菜园等小作坊，腌制各种咸菜，制作豆腐、豆芽、粉菜等，开展副食品加工和调料生产。
    第四，发展公共食堂的家底生产是建设提高公共食堂的重要内容。对于家底生产的管理，应当和整个食堂管理紧密结合起来。河南省在发展食堂家底生产的过程中，多数食堂采用的民主管理办法是：在生产队党支部和队务委员会的领导下，由社员生活代表会议或社员大会，讨论制定发展家底生产的规划和收支计划等。食堂管理委员会负责具体工作，并建立财务、保管等制度。账目实行日清月结，定期公布。一般的都作到了食堂家底生产和生产小队所有财产，分别经营，单独建账，分别管理。严格出入库手续，作到出入有凭证，动支有手续。对于家底生产的用途也作了具体规定，主要是：改善社员生活；解决油、盐调料、燃料等费用；扩大家底生产的投资；添置、修理食堂炊具；修补餐厅用具；抽出一定比例作为参加家底生产人员奖金。有的还建立了三包一奖的办法，即包数量、包工、包收入，超额奖励。上述制度的建立，保证了家底生产的健康发展。
    第五，开展大检查、大评比、插红旗、树标兵，及时总结交流先进经验，对发展家底生产发挥了巨大的作用。汝阳县发展食堂家底生产时，在全县范围内以六比六看的条件，开展了评比竞赛，六比六看是：比思想觉悟高，看家底生产发展的多、快、好、省；比加强领导，看炊事管理人员热心家底生产；比家畜家禽发展的快，质量好，看食堂的收入多；比饲养管理，看家畜家禽发展的健壮；比蔬菜生产的管理，看蔬菜收入的数量；比各种作坊建立的全，看食堂加工的副食品多。通过评比竞赛，鼓舞了大家的干劲，全县迅速的实现了堂堂养猪、种菜和建立自给性的小作坊。孟津县白合公社采用了以点带面召开现场会议的方法，促进了家底生产的发展。这个社以白合、七里两个大队为重点，先后召开了四次现场会，推广了柿子加工综合利用的经验，五天时间全社即做出柿子酱、醋等调味品达十五万斤。同时不少地方还运用半月一检查、一月一评比，定期进行奖励的办法，推动了家底生产的不断发展和提高。
