Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 30th: The Kishi Nobusuke clique, disregarding the Japanese people's rising voices against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," is plotting to force the Senate to "pass" this aggressive military treaty, which violates the interests of the Japanese nation and endangers Asian peace, before June 15th.

According to Radio Japan, some leaders of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party held a meeting on the evening of the 28th and decided to begin "deliberations" on the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in the Senate this week and to "aim for June 15th" to "make a resolution approving the new Security Treaty."

The Kishi Nobusuke clique also decided on the 26th that, during the Senate's "deliberation" and "passage" of the new "Security Treaty," it would seek "cooperation" from the "Senate Comrades Association" and other independents in order to make its illegal act of unilaterally "passing" the new "Security Treaty" appear superficially to conform to normal parliamentary procedures.

However, the "Senate Comrades Association" decided at the Senate plenary session this morning that if parliamentary activities do not return to normal, its ten senators will no longer participate in any Senate deliberations.

Prior to this, the Japan Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and the Independent Club had already expressed their refusal to participate in the Senate's deliberation of the new "Security Treaty."

    岸信介集团一意孤行
    阴谋强使参议院“通过”日美条约
    新华社30日讯　东京消息：岸信介集团不顾日本人民日益高涨的反对日美“安全条约”的呼声，阴谋在6月15日以前强使参议院“通过”这项违背日本民族利益和危害亚洲和平的侵略性军事条约。
    据日本电台报道，自由民主党当权派一些首脑28日晚间举行会议，决定要在本周内在参议院开始“审议”新日美“安全条约”，并且要“以6月15日为目标”，“作出批准新安全条约的决议”。
    岸信介集团还曾经在26日决定，在参议院“审议”和“通过”新“安全条约”时寻求“参议院同志会”和其他无党派者的“合作”，以便使它单独“通过”新“安全条约”的非法行为在表面上看来符合国会的正常程序。
    但是，“参议院同志会”今天上午在参议院全体议员会议上决定，如果国会的活动不恢复正常，它的十名参议员今后将不参加参议院的一切审议。
    在这以前，日本社会党、共产党和无党派俱乐部已经表示拒绝参加参议院对新“安全条约”的审议。
