The Underwater World
Shi You

Do you know what it's like deep down in the azure sea?

A Silent World

While the sea surface is surging with waves and white crests, the seabed is very calm. It turns out that even the biggest storms on the surface can only affect depths of a few dozen meters. The seabed is always a silent world. As the depth increases, the light gradually diminishes. From 500 meters below the surface, the ocean is dominated by darkness. But amidst the pitch black, there are twinkling stars. These are deep-sea fish with luminous organs. The cells on their bodies can secrete luciferin and luciferase, which emit light after oxidation. These deep-sea fish are the only messengers of light in the underwater world.

Fish "Language"

Is the seabed so quiet that there isn't a sound? No, it isn't. The inhabitants of the water are often whispering to each other. You can hear them with an underwater listening device: the buzzing sound like bees comes from small catfish; the chirping sound like small birds comes from large schools of bluefish; some fish make sounds like snoring; some fish even imitate the barking of dogs.... According to Soviet scientists, fish can emit sounds and ultrasonic waves, and they also rely on their ears and the "lateral lines" distributed on both sides of their bodies and heads to receive sound waves. They make one kind of sound when they are eating, and another when they are moving; they become particularly talkative during reproduction, and they will also send out alarms when they encounter danger. The Soviet Union is now experimenting with using instruments that mimic fish calls to lure schools of fish.

Amazing Swimmers

It is now known that there are about 30,000 species of animals in the sea, and they swim in a variety of interesting ways. The "sea snail" – the sea cucumber – crawls by contracting its muscles, advancing only four meters per hour. The sailfish, with its spindle-shaped body, can swim 90 kilometers per hour when attacking other underwater animals, which is faster than an ordinary train. Squid and octopus can rapidly squirt water from the funnel tube in their bodies, using the reaction force of the water to move backwards, no wonder they are called "rockets of the ocean." Some shellfish have meat feet like sails, extending out of the water, raising their sails and breaking through the waves. Some shellfish are even more ingenious, they attach themselves to the bottom of ships, making free long-distance trips.

The Topography of the Seabed

The average depth of the seabed is 4,000 meters. It is generally flat, but there are also canyons and abysses. The deepest of these was recently discovered by the Soviet "Vityaz" in the Pacific Ocean, the Mariana Trench, which is 11,000 meters deep. There are also many mountain ranges on the seabed: the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in the Atlantic Ocean; the Central Indian Ridge in the Indian Ocean; the Lomonosov Ridge in the Arctic Ocean; and even underwater volcanoes in the Pacific Ocean. The forests and grasslands on the seabed are more colorful than those on land, with brown, light purple, and red colors. The smallest of these underwater plants are invisible to the naked eye, while some seaweeds are as long as two or three hundred meters, making them the longest living things on earth. Underwater plants can be used as fodder, and some (such as kelp) are also very nutritious foods.

Our Treasure Trove

The seabed contains rich deposits of coal and oil. Not long ago, vast areas of the seabed in the southern Pacific Ocean were discovered to contain manganese and iron nodules, with one area containing tens of billions of tons. Not only that, the seabed also has rare metals that are scarce on Earth, such as rubidium, a raw material for manufacturing photoelectric tubes, which is stored in seawater with 300 million tons. In addition, we must not forget that every cubic kilometer of seawater contains 30 million tons of salt. And most importantly, future thermonuclear boilers can obtain an inexhaustible source of raw materials from seawater - heavy hydrogen. The vast ocean is truly the most abundant reserve force of minerals on Earth!

    海底世界
    石友
    你可知道，在那蔚蓝色大海的深处到底是怎样的呢？
    静静的世界
    当海面上波涛澎湃、白浪滔天的时候，海底却很平静。原来海面上最大的风浪也只能影响到几十米深，海底永远是个静静的世界。随着深度的增加，光线就逐渐减弱，从水下五百米开始，大海就被黑暗统治了。可是在一片漆黑之间却有点点星光在闪烁，这是具有发光器官的深水鱼，它们身上的细胞能分泌出萤光素和萤光素酶，经过氧化就会发出光来。这些深水鱼是海底世界唯一的光明使者。
          鱼类的“语言”
    海底是否静穆得一点声音也没有呢？不是的。水中居民们常常在切切私语，你用水中听音器就可以听见：那像蜜蜂嗡嗡的声音是小鲇鱼发出的；那像小鸟叽叽的声音是大群青鱼发出的；有的鱼发出的声音像打鼾；有的鱼竟会模仿狗叫……。据苏联科学家的研究：原来鱼会发出声音和超音波，也会依靠耳朵和分布在身体两侧及头部的“侧线”来接受音波。他们在吃食时发出一种声音，在行进时又是一种；在繁殖时变得特别爱唠叨；遇到危险还会发出警报。现在苏联正在试验利用摹拟鱼鸣声的仪器来诱捕鱼群。奇妙的游泳家
    现在知道海中动物约有三万种，他们游起泳来形形色色，非常有趣。“海底蜗牛”—海参依靠肌肉收缩爬行，每小时只前进四米。而身体像梭子一样的旗鱼在攻击其它海底动物时每小时可游九十公里，比普通火车还快。乌贼和章鱼可以把水从身体的漏斗管中急速地喷出来，利用水的反推力向后进，无怪乎人称“海洋中的火箭”。有些贝类长着帆一样的肉足，伸出水面，扬帆破浪。还有些贝类更妙，他们吸附在轮船底下，作免费长途旅行。
          海底的地形
    海底的平均深度是四千米，它大体上是平坦的，但也有峡谷和深渊，其中最深的是苏联“勇士号”最近在太平洋发现的，即里的马利亚纳海沟深达一万一千米。海底的山脉也不少：在大西洋有大西洋山脉；在印度洋有中央印度洋山脉；在北极有罗蒙诺索夫山脉；在太平洋甚至还有海底火山。海底的森林和草地比陆地上的更绚烂多彩，有褐色的，有淡紫色的，还有红色的。这些海底植物最小的连肉眼都看不见，而有些大海藻却长达两、三百米，是地球上最长的生物。海底植物可以用作饲料，有的（如海带）还是很有营养价值的食品。
          我们的宝库
    海底蕴藏有丰富的煤和石油。不久以前，还在太平洋南部的大片海底发现含锰、铁的凝结物，有一处达几十亿吨。不仅如此，海底还有地球上很少的稀有金属，如制造光电管的原料铷在海水中就储藏有三亿吨。此外，我们不要忘记了每一立方公里的海水就含有三千万吨食盐。而最重要的是，未来的热核锅炉可以从海水中获得取之不尽的原料——重氢。汪洋大海真是地球上矿藏最丰富的后备军！
