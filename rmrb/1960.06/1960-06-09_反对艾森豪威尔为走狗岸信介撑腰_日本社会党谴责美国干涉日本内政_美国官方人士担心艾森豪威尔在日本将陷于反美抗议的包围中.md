Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 8th: The Japanese Socialist Party today once again demanded that Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi and Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama take measures to cancel Eisenhower's planned visit to Japan.

The Socialist Party's Secretary-General Saburo Eda and four other Socialist Party leaders submitted this request in a letter to Chief Cabinet Secretary Etsusaburo Shiina.

The request condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government's intention to use Eisenhower's visit to Japan to prolong his political life. The request stated that the United States' doing so is equivalent to interfering in Japan's internal affairs.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, June 7th: Faced with the raging struggle of the Japanese people against the new US-Japan "Security Treaty," some people in the US ruling group have expressed concern about Eisenhower's upcoming visit to Japan, believing that the US president should reconsider this visit.

Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman, Democrat J. William Fulbright, told reporters on the evening of June 6th: Given the development of the situation in Japan, Eisenhower's "postponement of his visit to Japan may be wise."

Democratic Senator John Stennis also said on June 6th that, in view of the demonstrations taking place in Japan, he felt "uneasy" about Eisenhower's upcoming visit to Japan. He said that although this visit "is, of course, a matter for him (Eisenhower) to decide," "the atmosphere of goodwill has been clouded," and he "regrets the situation that has formed."

Democratic Deputy Leader Mike Mansfield also said: "I also feel uneasy."

United Press International reporter Hansley reported from Washington that the "Ike stay home" demonstrations erupting in Japan "have caused some officials to doubt whether the president should make the trip."

The "Chicago Sun-Times" Washington correspondent reported that some US "senior officials" were advising Eisenhower to abandon his visit to Japan. These advisors were concerned that Eisenhower might be "insulted" in Japan. They believe that "if police use clubs against Japanese protesters, it will undermine the spiritual and psychological importance of the president's visit."

The Associated Press expressed concern on June 6th that Eisenhower "will be caught in a riot of anti-American protests during his visit to Japan," and expressed concern that Eisenhower will experience "the most unpleasant experience of his life" in Japan.

    反对艾森豪威尔为走狗岸信介撑腰
    日本社会党谴责美国干涉日本内政
    美国官方人士担心艾森豪威尔在日本将陷于反美抗议的包围中
    新华社8日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天再度要求日本首相岸信介和外务相藤山爱一郎采取措施，取消艾森豪威尔访问日本的计划。
    社会党书记长江田三郎和另外四位社会党领袖在递交内阁官房长官椎名悦三郎的一封要求书中提出了这个要求。
    这封要求书谴责岸信介政府打算利用艾森豪威尔访问日本来达到延长他的政治生命的目的。要求书说，美国这样做就等于是干涉日本的内政。
    新华社7日讯　华盛顿消息：面对着日本人民怒火燎原的反对日美新“安全条约”的强大斗争，美国统治集团中有些人对艾森豪威尔即将到日本的访问表示担忧，他们认为美国总统应该重新考虑这次访问。
    参议院外交委员会主席、民主党人富布赖特6日晚上对新闻记者说：鉴于日本局势的发展，艾森豪威尔“延期访问日本也许是明智的”。
    民主党参议员史坦尼斯6日也表示，鉴于在日本发生的示威，他对艾森豪威尔即将访问日本感到“不安”，他说，虽然这次访问“当然是由他（艾森豪威尔）决定的事”，但是“亲善的气氛被乌云笼罩起来了”，他“对形成的局势感到很遗憾”。
    民主党代理领袖曼斯菲尔德也说：“我也感到不安”。
    合众国际社记者汉斯莱从华盛顿发出的一条消息谈到，在日本爆发的“艾克留在家里”的示威“使得某些官员们怀疑总统是否应当进行这次访问”。
    “芝加哥太阳时报”驻华盛顿记者报道说，某些美国“高级官员”劝艾森豪威尔放弃对日本的访问。这些劝告者耽心的是，艾森豪威尔可能在日本“遭到侮辱”，他们认为，“如果警察用木棍对付日本的游行者，那末，这将破坏总统这次访问精神上和心理上的重要意义。”
    美联社6日表示担心，艾森豪威尔“在他访问日本时将陷入一场反美抗议的骚乱中”，并且表示担心，艾森豪威尔在日本将体验到“他一生中最不愉快的经验”。
