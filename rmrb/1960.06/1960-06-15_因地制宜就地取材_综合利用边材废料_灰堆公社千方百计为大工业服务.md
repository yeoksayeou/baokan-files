    Adapting to Local Conditions, Utilizing Local Materials, Comprehensively Utilizing Edge Materials and Waste
    Hui Dui Commune Makes Every Effort to Serve Large-Scale Industry

    (By our newspaper) The Hui Dui People's Commune, organized around the state-owned Tianjin Paper Mill, is running industries that serve the large factories and the market by utilizing the edge materials and waste materials from the large factories, and comprehensively organizes the lives of workers and commune members around the large factories. The commune and the Tianjin Paper Mill support and cooperate with each other, promoting high-speed development of production.

    Under the guidance of the idea of "serving large-scale industry," the commune-run industries of the Hui Dui Commune are built by adapting to local conditions, utilizing local materials, comprehensively using the edge materials, waste materials, and scraps from the paper mill, and relying on self-reliance. The Tianjin Paper Mill produces a large amount of waste materials and scraps every day. For example, the pulping workshop produces about 200 tons of sulfite waste liquor every day. In the past, these waste liquids flowed into the Haihe River through large pipes, and a lot of pulp was lost from the wastewater. In addition, furnace ash, waste gas, shredded paper, waste paper edges, etc., were not well utilized in the past. As soon as the People's Commune was established, it set up nine satellite factories, making every effort to comprehensively utilize these waste materials and scraps. They used waste pulp to run a small paper mill; used sulfite waste liquor to run a plasticizer factory and an adhesive factory; and used dilute sulfuric acid, waste gas, and furnace ash discarded by the paper mill in the past as raw materials to run an aluminum sulfate factory. They carefully sorted out the damaged paper that the paper mill used to treat as waste, and the bookbinding factory used it to make various booklets. They also set up a flower-pulling factory, dyeing shredded paper and paper strips to make lanterns, streamers, etc., which became decorations for arranging auditoriums and meeting places. These commune-run factories have ample raw materials, and their products are very much needed by large factories and the market, so they have developed rapidly. The small paper mill has produced more than 430 tons of wrapping paper, slogan paper, and straw board paper in the past year or so using waste pulp. The bookbinding factory has produced more than 23 million various exercise books using damaged paper. The adhesive factory produces more than 880 tons of adhesive, which supplies Anshan Iron and Steel, Baotou Iron and Steel, and many refractory material factories. The plasticizer produced by the commune's plasticizer factory is a necessary material for large-scale reinforced concrete pouring projects such as bridges and reservoirs. It has produced more than 2,000 tons in the past year or so, supporting the construction of large-scale reservoirs such as the Sanmenxia and Miyun Reservoirs.

    In the process of developing production, the Party Committee of the Hui Dui Commune also educated some cadres and commune members who simply relied on large factories, so that the commune and the Tianjin Paper Mill established a relationship of mutual cooperation and mutual support, jointly promoting high-speed development of production. Aluminum sulfate is a widely used material in paper mills. The commune uses waste dilute sulfuric acid, waste gas, and furnace ash to produce aluminum sulfate, which is all supplied to the paper mill, which can meet a quarter of the paper mill's needs. In the past, there was an insufficient supply of straw ropes used by the paper mill to package its products. The commune overcame all difficulties to set up a straw rope factory, which guaranteed all the straw ropes needed by the paper mill.

    Starting from production, the Hui Dui People's Commune also organized a life service network centered on the paper mill, comprehensively organizing the lives of workers and commune members. Of the more than 2,700 households and more than 17,000 residents in the Hui Dui Commune, more than 80% are family members of the paper mill workers. After the establishment of the commune, it successively set up fifteen public canteens, fifteen childcare organizations, and a hospital with eleven medical departments in the workers' new villages and neighborhoods where workers lived, and established eight life service stations, commodity consignment stores, and other life service organizations and more than 240 service groups, forming a dotted service network. In November last year, in order to enable large factories to concentrate on production, the commune unified the management of the life service organizations of the paper mill as conditions gradually matured. After the commune took over these service organizations, it improved the management system, added service management personnel, and made these life service organizations better than before. After the commune took over the factory's nurseries, it took care of the children's bathing, haircuts, medical treatment, disassembly and washing of clothes, etc., and extended the pick-up time, so that the female workers had more time to rest and participate in learning and other activities. In the past, only 49% of the female workers in the paper mill's finishing workshops participated in cultural learning, but now the vast majority of female workers participate.

    因地制宜就地取材  综合利用边材废料
    灰堆公社千方百计为大工业服务
    本报讯　以国营天津造纸总厂为中心组织起来的灰堆人民公社，利用大工厂的边材废料大办为大工厂和市场服务的工业，并且以大工厂为中心全面组织职工和社员的生活。公社和天津造纸总厂互相支援、互相协作，促进了生产的高速度发展。
    灰堆公社的社办工业是在“为大工业服务”的思想指导下，因地制宜，就地取材，综合利用造纸总厂的边料、废料和下脚料，自力更生办起来的。天津造纸总厂每天都要出大量的废料和下脚料。例如，制浆车间每天就要出二百吨左右的亚硫酸盐废药液，这些废液过去都顺着大管道流进海河，从废水里流失的纸浆也很多。此外，炉灰、废气、碎纸头、废纸边等等，过去也没有很好利用起来。人民公社一成立，就办起九个卫星工厂，千方百计地综合利用这些废料和下脚料。他们利用废纸浆办了一个小型造纸厂；利用亚硫酸盐废药液办了塑化剂厂和粘合剂厂；利用过去造纸总厂扔掉的稀硫酸、废气和炉灰当原料，办起了硫酸铝厂。他们把造纸总厂过去当做废料处理的损纸经过精心整理，由制本厂用来制作各种簿册；他们还办了一个拉花厂，把碎纸头和纸条染色后制成灯笼、彩条等，成为布置礼堂、会场的装饰品。这些社办工厂有了充足的原料，产品又都是大工厂和市场上非常需要的，因此发展很快。小型造纸厂利用废纸浆一年多来生产了四百三十多吨包装纸、标语纸和草板纸。制本厂利用损纸制出了二千三百多万本各种练习本。粘合剂厂生产的八百八十多吨粘合剂，供应着鞍钢、包钢和许多耐火器材厂。公社塑化剂厂生产的塑化剂，是桥梁、水库等大型钢筋浇注工程必需的材料，一年多来已经生产两千多吨，支援了三门峡、密云等大型水库的建设。
    灰堆公社在发展生产的过程中，公社党委也曾对某些干部和社员单纯依赖大工厂的思想进行了教育，使公社和天津造纸总厂建立了互相协作、互相支援的关系，共同促进生产的高速度发展。硫酸铝是造纸厂里用途很广的材料，公社利用废稀硫酸、废气和炉灰生产出了硫酸铝，全部供应造纸总厂，可以满足造纸总厂需要量的四分之一。过去造纸总厂包装产品用的草绳供应不足，公社就克服一切困难办起一个草绳厂，使造纸厂需要的全部草绳有了保证。
    灰堆人民公社从生产出发，还以造纸总厂为中心组织了生活服务网，全面组织职工和社员的生活。在灰堆公社的两千七百多户共一万七千多居民中，有80％以上是造纸总厂的职工家属。公社成立以后，先后在职工聚居的工人新村和里巷办起了十五个公共食堂、十五个托儿组织和设有十一个医疗科目的卫生院，并且成立了八处生活服务站、商品代销店等生活服务组织和二百四十多个服务小组，形成了星罗棋布的服务网。去年11月间，公社为了使大工厂集中精力搞好生产，在条件逐步成熟的情况下，把造纸总厂的生活服务组织也统一管理起来。公社接管这些服务组织以后，改善了管理制度，增添了服务管理人员，使这些生活服务组织比以前办得更好。公社接办工厂的托儿所以后，把孩子的洗澡、理发、看病、拆洗衣服等都包了下来，而且延长了收托时间，使女工们有更多的时间休息和参加学习等活动。造纸总厂完成车间的女工过去只有49％的人参加文化学习，现在绝大部分女工都参加了。
