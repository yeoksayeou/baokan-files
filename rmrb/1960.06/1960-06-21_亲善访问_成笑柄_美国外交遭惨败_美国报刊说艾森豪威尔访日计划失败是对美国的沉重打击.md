Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch from Washington: American newspapers and news agencies continue to comment with considerable dismay on the major failure suffered by the United States over Eisenhower's "visit" to Japan.

    The "Wall Street Journal" published a commentary on the 17th, saying that the purpose of Eisenhower's "visit" to Japan was originally "to spread (US-Japan) goodwill" and "to help the government of Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, to deeply impress Asians, especially Communist Chinese." The newspaper said, however, that "the result was completely the opposite," and "the United States has been made to look ridiculous in the eyes of all of Asia." Moreover, the newspaper wrote, "It is quite inadequate to say merely that the United States has failed to obtain from Eisenhower's visit the things it hoped to obtain. It is not excessive to say that we have encountered things exactly the opposite of our hopes in every place.”

    The Boston "Herald" wrote, "One cannot close one's eyes to the fact that canceling the visit is a defeat." The Milwaukee "Journal" said, "Now the inevitable has happened: the cancellation of the invitation is a disgrace." The "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" pointed out, "The President's cancellation of his visit to Japan is a failure of Western diplomacy, a failure as disastrous as the U-2 aircraft incident... Cancelling the visit is a heavy blow."

    Associated Press news analyst Marrow emphasized on the 17th that Eisenhower's failure "is just the latest disaster in a series of disasters (suffered by the United States)." Associated Press reporter Scully, who accompanied Eisenhower on his "visit," said in a dispatch sent en route that the "rebuff" Eisenhower received was the "culmination" of a series of blows recently suffered by the United States. The reporter wrote sarcastically: "Rarely in diplomatic history has an American president encountered three such great defeats in succession as those suffered by Eisenhower."

    The reporter pointed out that "the President, in 31 days of continuous crisis," suffered three blows: the American spy flight incident, the Soviet Union's cancellation of Eisenhower's invitation to visit the Soviet Union, and the "complete end" of the planned visit to Japan.

    New York "Herald Tribune" reporter Donovan wrote in a report that when Eisenhower received Nobusuke Kishi's message asking him to cancel the "visit," "a look appeared on his face like the one he has when he bites into a lemon."

    “亲善访问”成笑柄　美国外交遭惨败
    美国报刊说艾森豪威尔访日计划失败是对美国的沉重打击
    新华社18日讯　华盛顿消息：美国的报刊和通讯社继续以十分沮丧的口吻评论美国在艾森豪威尔“访”日问题上所遭到的大失败。
    “华尔街日报”17日发表评论说，艾森豪威尔“访问”日本的目的本来“是要散布（美日）亲善”并且“给岸信介首相政府助一臂之力，使亚洲人、特别是共产党中国人有深刻印象”。报纸说，但是，“结果完全相反”，“美国已经被弄得在整个亚洲的眼光中看来很可笑”，而且，报纸写道，“如果仅仅说美国未能取得它希望从艾森豪威尔访问中取得的东西，那是太不够了。如果说我们在每一个地方都碰到了跟我们的希望恰恰相反的事情，这并不过分。
    波士顿“先驱报”写道，“不能闭眼不看这样的事实：取消访问就是失败。”密尔窝基“新闻报”说，“现在发生了不可避免的事情：取消邀请是一种耻辱。”“圣路易邮报”指出，“总统取消对日本的访问是西方外交上的失败，这种失败像U—2式飞机事件遭到惨败一样。……取消访问是一个沉重的打击。
    美联社新闻分析员马劳17日强调说，艾森豪威尔这次失败“不过是（美国所遭到的）灾难中最近一个灾难而已”。随艾森豪威尔“访问”的美联社记者斯卡利在途中发出的一篇消息中说，艾森豪威尔这次吃的“闭门羹”是美国最近所受到的一系列打击的“顶点”。这个记者讽嘲地写道：“在外交史上很少有一位美国总统接连遭遇到三次像艾森豪威尔所忍受的那么大程度的挫败”。
    记者指出，“这位总统在31天接连不断的危机中”受到了三件事情的打击，即美国间谍飞行事件，苏联撤消对艾森豪威尔访问苏联的邀请和这次访问日本的计划“宣告完蛋”。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”记者杜诺万在一篇报道中写道，当艾森豪威尔收到岸信介要他取消“访问”的消息时，他的脸上“出现了像他啃柠檬时那样的表情”。
