Fighting the Summer Heat to Seize High Yields

    Secretary Takes Charge of Heatstroke Prevention
    With the sudden hot weather, most of the exhaust fans and spraying cooling equipment in the Tianjin No. 2 Steel Plant and Electrolytic Copper Plant have been put into operation.
    This year, both plants have increased their heatstroke prevention and cooling equipment compared to last year. The number of exhaust fans in the Electrolytic Copper Plant has increased from 31 last year to 69 this year. In the Ferroalloy Workshop of the No. 2 Steel Plant, water curtain insulation equipment has been added this year, reducing the temperature in front of the furnace by about 20 degrees Celsius compared to last year; the converter steelmaking workshop has also added more than 30 exhaust fans. Leading cadres and safety personnel of both plants have been going deep into the workshops for days to check the use of heatstroke prevention and cooling equipment. In Workshop No. 1 of the Electrolytic Copper Plant, the Party Committee Secretary discovered that although cool sheds had been erected in front of the furnaces, sunlight was still shining in, preventing workers from resting. He immediately organized manpower to rebuild the cool sheds and vacated a large office specifically for workers to rest in.

    书记抓防暑
    天气骤热，天津市第二钢厂和电解铜厂的大部分排风扇和喷雾等降温设备都已经开动起来了。
    今年，这两个厂的防暑降温设备都比去年增加了。电解铜厂的排风扇由去年的三十一个增加到六十九个。第二钢厂的铁合金车间，今年增加了水幕隔热设备，炉前温度比去年降低了二十度左右；转炉炼钢车间又增加了排风扇三十多台。两个厂的领导干部和安全部门的人员，连日深入车间检查防暑降温设备使用情况。电解铜厂党委书记在一车间发现炉前虽搭了凉棚，太阳光仍然要照进来，工人不得休息，当即一面组织人力重新搭凉棚，一面又腾出一大间办公室，专供给工人休息。
