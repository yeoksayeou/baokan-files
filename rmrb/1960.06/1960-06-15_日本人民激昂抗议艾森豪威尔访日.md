Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 14th: Approximately five thousand Japanese youth, men, and women workers held a large-scale demonstration near the Diet, the official residence of Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, and the U.S. Embassy tonight.

They expressed strong protest against the American President's "visit" to Japan and against the police suppression of labor unions and student groups who demonstrated against Hagerty at the airport on June 10th.

In front of the U.S. Embassy, there were a thousand Japanese policemen wearing helmets guarding it today. However, the protesters still held a demonstration there for more than an hour. They passionately shouted: "Ike, don't come!", "Take back the black jets!", "We want to defend peace in Asia!".

Before starting the demonstration, the workers held a meeting in the square near the Diet. Speaking at the meeting were Kozo Minaguchi, Secretary-General of the National Council Against Revision of the "Security Treaty," Toshio Tanaka, Chairman of the Social Democratic Party's National Movement Committee, and Yoshio Shiga, Communist Party member of the Diet.

Kozo Minaguchi emphasized that Eisenhower's visit to Japan has the task of strengthening the military alliance in Northeast Asia. He said: Eisenhower "is definitely not executing a mission of peace."

Toshio Tanaka criticized the police suppression of mass organizations, saying that when the police broke into student union and labor union offices late at night on June 13, their actions were like thieves. Tanaka called on the participants to unite their ranks and defeat the Nobusuke Kishi government's conspiracy to persecute the people's anti-"Security Treaty" movement.

Yoshio Shiga emphasized that workers should successfully hold a general strike tomorrow, thereby expressing their firm determination to crush all attempts to attack the anti-"Security Treaty" movement.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 14th:  Tadao Sata, Director of the International Bureau of the Japanese Socialist Party, said on the 13th regarding the statement issued by Eisenhower before his departure for the Far East on the 12th, that the U.S. President's visit to Japan is in fact an interference in Japan's internal affairs.

Sata pointed out that U.S. Presidential Press Secretary Hagerty said, "The anti-U.S. President's visit to Japan movement is influenced and incited by foreign countries," and "The Social Democratic Party's attitude does not represent the opinions of all party members," which is a distortion of the facts.

Sata also said that the U.S. President emphasized in his statement that "this visit to Japan has no political intentions" and "does not mean supporting a certain regime, treaty, or policy that is the focus of discussion"; however, at a time when the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet is attempting to use the U.S. President's visit to Japan for domestic politics and suppress the majority of the Japanese people who are demanding the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet's resignation for democracy, the U.S. President's visit to Japan is in fact an interference in Japan's internal affairs.

Sata said that the Japanese people are very worried that Eisenhower's visit to Japan will strengthen the Japan-U.S. "security system," pull Japan into the U.S. military alliance with the Philippines, the Chiang Kai-shek Group, and South Korea, intensify the tension between Japan and China and the Soviet Union, and involve Japan in war.

Sata emphasized that in order to avoid such a result, the U.S. President's visit to Japan should be cancelled.

Chairman Inejiro Asanuma of the Socialist Party refuted the cliché that the anti-American demonstrations by the Japanese people were "incited by the Communist Party." Asanuma said: This statement is "baseless nonsense."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 14th: The Japanese Communist Party's newspaper "Akahata" published an editorial today, calling on the Japanese people to resolutely oppose Eisenhower's visit to Japan and wage a relentless struggle against U.S. imperialism.

The editorial pointed out that the purpose of Eisenhower's visit to Japan is to show U.S. support for Nobusuke Kishi and to impose the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" on Japan.

"Akahata" pointed out that the Nobusuke Kishi clique is now attempting to threaten the Japanese people by calling the incident in which the Japanese people surrounded U.S. Presidential Press Secretary Hagerty at Tokyo Airport on June 10 "an unprecedented crime committed by mobs."

"Akahata" said that MacArthur II's position in Japan is only that of an ambassador, but he is also attempting to threaten the Japanese people not to oppose Eisenhower's visit by issuing a statement emphasizing that the airport incident "has had a very bad impact in the United States."

"Akahata's" editorial said: "When we are threatened by the U.S. imperialists and the traitor Nobusuke Kishi and his army, how can we Japanese people welcome President Eisenhower as we would welcome an ordinary foreign head of state?"

"Akahata" said: "The dignity of the Japanese nation and our correct judgment do not allow us to do so."

"Akahata" emphasized: "Eisenhower is indeed a foreign head of state. But he is the foremost and primary representative of the U.S. imperialists who are keen on enslaving the Japanese people. Therefore, he cannot represent the American people, just as Japanese imperialists cannot represent the Japanese people."

The editorial concluded by emphasizing: "We insist on waging a relentless struggle against U.S. imperialists. This struggle is a just and patriotic struggle to defend the Japanese nation and safeguard the dignity of the Japanese people."

    日本人民激昂抗议艾森豪威尔访日
    东京五千工人在岸信介官邸和美国大使馆前示威
    社会党声明艾森豪威尔访日是干涉日本内政压制日本人民斗争的行为
    “赤旗报”说反对艾森豪威尔访日是维护日本人民尊严的爱国正义斗争
    新华社14日讯　东京消息：大约五千名日本青年男女工人今天晚间在国会附近、岸信介首相官邸和美国大使馆前面举行了声势浩大的示威。
    他们表示强烈抗议美国总统  “访问”日本和抗议警察镇压6月10日在机场举行反对哈格蒂的示威的工会和学生团体。
    在美国大使馆前，今天有一千名头戴钢盔的日本警察守卫。但是抗议者仍然在那里举行了一个多小时的示威。他们激昂地高呼：“艾克不要来！”，“把黑色喷气机撤回去！”，“我们要保卫亚洲的和平！”。
    工人们在开始示威以前，在国会附近的广场上举行了大会。在大会上讲话的有阻止修改“安全条约”国民会议事务局长水口宏三、社会党国民运动委员会委员长田中稔男和共产党议员志贺义雄。
    水口宏三着重指责了艾森豪威尔来日本负有加强东北亚军事同盟的任务。他说：艾森豪威尔“决不是执行和平的使命”。
    田中稔男指责警察镇压群众团体说，当警察在6月13日深夜闯进学生会和工会办公室的时候，他们的举动像小偷。田中呼吁与会者团结它们的队伍，击退岸信介政府迫害人民反对“安全条约”运动的阴谋活动。
    志贺义雄着重指出，工人们应当在明天胜利地举行总罢工，从而表示他们的坚强决心：粉碎一切企图向反对“安全条约”运动进攻的尝试。
    新华社14日讯　东京消息：日本社会党国际局长佐多忠隆13日就艾森豪威尔在12日启程前往远东访问之前发表的声明发表谈话说，美国总统访日事实上是对日本内政的干涉。
    佐多指出，美国总统新闻秘书哈格蒂说，“日本的反对美国总统访日运动是受到外国的影响和煽动的”，“社会党的态度没有代表全体党员的意见”，这是对事实的歪曲。
    佐多又说，美国总统在声明中强调“这次访日并无政治意图”，“也并不意味着支持某一个政权、条约或者是成为议论焦点的政策”；但是，在岸信介内阁企图把美国总统访日利用于国内政治，压制多数的日本人民为了民主要求岸信介内阁下台的时候，美国总统要前来访问日本，事实上是对日本内政的干涉。
    佐多说，日本人民非常担心，艾森豪威尔这次访日将会加强日美“安全体系”，把日本拉入美国同菲律宾、蒋介石集团、南朝鲜的军事同盟中，加剧日本同中国和苏联之间的紧张局势，并会使日本卷入战争。
    佐多强调说，为了避免招致这样的结果，美国总统访日应该取消。
    社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎驳斥了所谓日本人民的反美示威是“共产党煽动的”这种滥调。浅沼说：这种说法是“没有根据的胡说”。
    新华社14日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论，号召日本人民坚决反对艾森豪威尔访问日本；并同美帝国主义进行无情的斗争。
    社论指出，艾森豪威尔访问日本的目的是要表示美国支持岸信介和把新日美“安全条约”强加于日本。
    “赤旗报”指出，岸信介集团现在企图用把日本人民在6月10日在东京飞机场包围美国总统新闻秘书哈格蒂的事件叫作“暴民所犯的空前的罪行”来威胁日本人民。
    “赤旗报”说，麦克阿瑟第二在日本的地位只不过是一个大使，但他也企图通过发表强调机场事件“在美国引起了很坏的影响”的声明，来威胁日本人民不要反对艾森豪威尔的访问。
    “赤旗报”的社论说：“当我们受到美帝国主义者和卖国贼岸信介以及他的军队的威胁的时候，我们日本人民怎么能够像接待普通的外国首脑那样来欢迎艾森豪威尔总统呢？”
    “赤旗报”说：“日本民族的尊严以及我们的正确的判断不容许我们这样作。”
    “赤旗报”强调说：“艾森豪威尔的确是一个外国的首脑。但是，他是热中于奴役日本人民的美帝国主义者的第一个和最主要的代表。因而他不能代表美国人民，正如日本帝国主义者不能代表日本人民一样。”
    社论最后强调说：“我们坚持对美帝国主义者进行无情的斗争。这场斗争是保卫日本民族和维护日本人民的尊严的正义的和爱国的斗争。”
