    A Trip to Mount Da Mao
    Wang Zhuyu

    I
    Mount Da Mao, located in the northeast of Jiangxi Province, was once a glorious Soviet area, the home of the Red Army.

    Thirty years ago, our revolutionary martyr, Comrade Fang Zhimin, led Red Army soldiers in battles on Mount Da Mao. In those days of white terror and darkness, they held high the red flag and torches, engaging in life-and-death struggles with the enemy in close combat.

    Every inch of land on Mount Da Mao bears the footprints of the Red Army; every mountain valley was lit by Red Army campfires; every cave served as Red Army trenches…

    Today, whenever we, the revolutionary descendants, step on this heroic land and climb this heroic mountain, everyone's heart is filled with awe. Yes, the jade belt among the mountains—the rushing streams—resemble the Red Army's war songs; the forest music—the roaring pine waves—seems to be praising the immortal achievements of the revolutionary martyrs!

    II

    In 1958, during the days of the Great Leap Forward, Comrade Fang Zhichun, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee and younger brother of the revolutionary martyr Fang Zhimin, led the first group of Jiangxi's "up to the mountains and down to the countryside" cadres to Mount Da Mao. Following the glorious footsteps of the Red Army, they cut through thorns and brambles, and established a large-scale state-owned comprehensive reclamation farm and a branch of the Communist Labor University in this "poor and blank" desolate mountain valley.

    Now, socialist Mount Da Mao has become even more lovely. The east wind blows strong, the sun shines brightly, and everywhere presents a thriving and vibrant scene. At the foot of Mount Da Mao, in the mountain valley surrounded by cliffs and peaks, the newly built buildings and bungalows, with their green bricks and red tiles, are set off by the verdant pines and bamboos covering the mountains, resembling a magnificent landscape painting. The noisy construction sites and factory buildings, with their humming motors and buzzing electric saws, accompanied by the songs and laughter of the pioneers, compose a movement of mountain construction.

    During the day, red flags flutter everywhere on the mountainside and riverside, and there are laboring crowds everywhere. Those transporting bamboo and wood pull self-made wooden carts and navigate self-made bamboo boats, with a constant flow of traffic. Look, cart after cart, boat after boat, loaded with the fruits of labor, loaded with the joy of harvest, stepping on mountain paths and treading through rapids, heading forward in a mighty stream…

    At night, moonlight spills down the mountain, and stars are embedded in the trees. Wisps of smoke cling to the white clouds, wriggling in the sky; bright electric lights, like stars, dot the mountain valley. At this time, the people who have toiled all day appear even more active: some go to the gurgling streams, cupping the cool spring water, washing away the day's fatigue; some sit around the radio, attentively listening to the sounds of Beijing; some frolic in the club, singing and dancing lightly, singing "Da Mao Mountain, oh, a good place"; some sit quietly in the reading room, absorbed in their books, intently reading "Selected Works of Mao Zedong"…

    III

    This scenic spot, this lovely "mountain city" that never sleeps, is the location of the Jiangxi Da Mao Mountain Comprehensive Reclamation Farm and the Da Mao Mountain Branch of the Communist Labor University. It is they—the masters of Mount Da Mao—who have painted this latest and most beautiful picture with their diligent hands. But who would have thought that this large-scale state-owned farm and this brand-new labor university were established two years ago on a desolate mountain covered with cogongrass and devoid of human habitation!

    Mount Da Mao is a revolutionary mountain; the people of Mount Da Mao are glorious people. Their brilliant labor has earned them high honors. The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee jointly presented the people of Mount Da Mao with a banner, on which were written two lines of shining golden characters:

    "The standard-bearer of building a new socialist mountain area,
    A model for training cadres to be both red and expert!"

    大茅山纪行
    王主玉
    一
    江西省东北境内的大茅山，曾经是光荣的苏区，是红军的故乡。
    三十年前，我们的革命先烈方志敏同志，曾率领着红军战士，战斗在大茅山上。在那白色恐怖、天昏地暗的日子里，他们高举着红旗、火把，和敌人短兵相接，进行着出生入死的斗争。
    大茅山，每一寸土地，都走过红军的脚印；每一条山坞，都燃过红军的篝火；每一个岩洞，都作过红军的战壕……
    今天，每当我们革命后代，踏上这块英雄的土地，攀登这座英雄高山的时候，人人的心情都会肃然起敬。是的，那山间玉带——奔腾的溪流，正似当年红军的战歌；那森林音乐——轰鸣的松涛，像在歌颂先烈的万古千秋的伟业！
    二
    1958年，在那大跃进的日子里，中共江西省委书记、革命先烈方志敏的弟弟——方志纯同志，率领着江西第一批“上山下乡”的干部，来到了大茅山。他们踏着当年红军的光荣脚印，斩荆披棘，在这“一穷二白”的荒山坳里，建立了一个大型的国营综合垦殖场，创办了一所共产主义劳动大学分校。
    现在，社会主义的大茅山，变得更可爱了。东风劲吹，阳光普照，处处呈现着欣欣向荣、一派生机的景象。在大茅山的脚下，在悬岩陡壁、峰峦拱抱的山坳里，那新建的楼房平屋，青砖红瓦，映衬着漫山的苍松翠竹，宛如一幅绝妙的山水画。那喧闹的工地厂房，马达欢唱，电锯??，伴着拓荒者的歌声笑语，谱成了一首建设山区的乐章。
    白天，山麓河畔，到处红旗招展，到处是劳动的人群。那运送竹木的人们，拉着自制的木车，驾着自制的竹船，车水马龙，川流不息。看呵，一车又一车，一船又一船，满载劳动的成果，满载丰收的喜悦，踏着山路，踩着激流，浩浩荡荡地奔向前方……
    夜晚，月光泻在山下，星星嵌在树上。袅袅的炊烟，贴着白云在高空蠕动；晶亮的电灯，像繁星缀满山谷。这时，辛劳一天的人们，显得更加活跃：有的走到潺潺的小溪边，捧着沁凉的泉水，洗去一天的疲劳；有的围坐在收音机旁，凝神屏息，聆听着北京的声音；有的嬉闹在俱乐部里，轻歌曼舞，唱着“大茅山呀好地方”；有的静坐在阅览室里，伏案攻书，全神贯注地读着“毛泽东选集”……三
    这个景色秀丽的地方，这个可爱的不夜“山城”，就是江西大茅山综合垦殖场和共产主义劳动大学大茅山分校的所在地。就是他们——大茅山的主人，用自己勤劳的双手，画下了这幅最新最美的图画。但谁能想到，这个大型的国营农场、这所全新的劳动大学，是二年前，在一片茅草丛生、渺无人迹的荒山上建立起来的呢！
    大茅山，是革命的山；大茅山的人，是光荣的人。他们的光辉劳动，换来了崇高的荣誉。中共江西省委和省人委共同给大茅山的人们送了奖旗，上面写着两行闪光的金字：
    “建设社会主义新山区的旗手，
    锻炼干部又红又专的榜样！”
