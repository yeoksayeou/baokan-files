Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 24th: Saigon Dispatch: Since the American-Ngô Đình Diệm clique enacted the so-called "Law No. 10 of 1959" in May of last year, violating the Geneva Accords, they have more frantically persecuted and massacred the people, especially those in former anti-Japanese base areas, carrying out large-scale "sweeps" and forcing people to "move into densely populated areas" and "reclamation areas," which are disguised concentration camps. In order to survive, the broad masses of the South Vietnamese people in various regions have risen up and adopted various methods to carry out heroic struggles against the brutal American-Ngô Đình Diệm clique. The scale and momentum of this struggle are growing.

	Slogans Against America Posted on Mỹ Tho City Streets
In Mỹ Tho City, the capital of Mỹ Tho Province, not long ago, the streets were plastered with slogans such as "Down with the Aggressive and Belligerent American Imperialism!" and "Oppose Law No. 10 of 1959!" At the same time, leaflets denouncing the crimes of the American-Ngô Đình Diệm clique and mobilizing the people to rise up in resistance appeared everywhere.
In Cái Bè, Cái Nhây, Châu Thành, and Mỹ Tho districts of Mỹ Tho Province, tens of thousands of people recently held demonstrations, with angry masses shouting slogans such as "Yankee Imperialists Get Out!" "Down with the traitor Ngô Đình Diệm!" "Resolutely Defend the Land! Oppose Conscription, Oppose the Establishment of 'Densely Populated Areas,' Oppose the Establishment of American Military Bases!" Many people ran out of the "Densely Populated Areas" to participate in the demonstrations, and strikes and market boycotts were held everywhere.

	More Than 2,000 People in Bến Tre Province Demonstrate at the District Government Office
In Bến Tre Province, which has suffered large-scale "sweeps" and brutal suppression, incidents have recently occurred in which two to three thousand people demonstrated at the district government office. They demanded that murderers be punished, that those who killed their relatives at the hands of the American-Ngô Đình Diệm clique pay with their lives, and that their arrested parents, husbands, and sons be released. The puppet district chief, frightened by the momentum of the demonstrators, attempted to escape, but was surrounded by children, women, and the elderly. Under the massive accusations, this "district chief" had to publicly admit the bloody crimes of the American-Ngô Đình Diệm clique and was forced to release some of the arrested people.
In Hậu Mỹ Commune, Cái Bè District, Mỹ Tho Province, in order to oppose the American-Ngô Đình Diệm clique clearing the way for American advisors to "inspect," they sent a battalion to carry out "sweeps" there. The men, women, old, and young people of the entire commune rose up in resistance, with many people carrying spears, knives, and sticks to fight.

	Quảng Nam Province Masses Launch Anti-Forced Relocation Struggle
In Điện Bàn, Đại Lộc, Hòa Vang, Duy Xuyên, and Quế Sơn districts of Quảng Nam Province, the people resolutely opposed forced relocation to "Densely Populated Areas." They put forward the slogan "Do not go to the concentrations, resolutely live in our own homes." In many villages, all the residents united to stop the American-Ngô Đình Diệm clique from demolishing people's houses. Recently, the people of Thừa Thiên Province and Đồng Tháp Mười area, who were forced to go to the Tây Nguyên "Reclamation Areas," resolutely opposed living an inhuman life in the "Reclamation Areas" and demanded to go home. They launched strikes, hunger strikes, and other united struggles, achieving preliminary victories. The authorities were forced to let them go home.

	People in Đồng Tháp Mười Area Reclaim Land and Ponds Seized
As a result of the heroic struggle of the people in the former well-known anti-Japanese base area of Đồng Tháp Mười area in South Vietnam against the American-Ngô Đình Diệm clique, they reclaimed the land and ponds that the American-Ngô Đình Diệm clique had seized in recent years, which had been distributed during the Anti-Japanese War. Recently, the people of the Đồng Tháp Mười area organized large-scale rallies and demonstrations under the slogans "Defend against the American-Ngô Đình Diệm clique robbing the people's fields and ponds" and "Down with the American Imperialist Aggressors and the Traitor Ngô Đình Diệm!"
In a village in Cà Mau Province, the people launched more than one hundred struggles against exploitation, conscription, forced relocation, and concentration in one month. Many local residents have also organized to resist local reactionary organizations. Whenever a suspected person enters the village, they strike the wooden fish to widely notify everyone. Some villages have also filled in the military canals dug by the American-Ngô Đình Diệm clique.
In Duy Xuyên District, Quảng Nam Province, when the authorities arrested a person to participate in the so-called "Study Communism Control," hundreds of people immediately rose up to stop and resist. In some "study classes," the elderly stood up and sternly condemned the Ngô Đình Diệm clique's massacre crimes face to face.

	American-Ngô Đình Diệm Clique Extremely Alarmed by People's Struggle
The increasingly powerful people's struggle activities have made the American-Ngô Đình Diệm clique extremely alarmed. A Saigon dispatch from United Press International on the 20th said, "It is a definite fact that this flat, rice-producing area (referring to South Vietnam) is very unsafe." The French newspaper Le Monde recently reported on the puppet authorities' panicked situation, saying that on some roads in the plateau area, patrolling armored vehicles were constantly moving. Sometimes, at certain locations, cars had to be blocked for an hour or two, waiting to form a convoy before daring to continue driving under the cover of cars carrying heavy machine guns. An Associated Press dispatch on May 3 acknowledged that American "military advisors" believed that the "wave" of the people's struggle "is making South Vietnam and the United States increasingly uneasy" and were worried that the Ngô Đình Diệm clique would be "unable to control" the situation.

    “美帝国主义滚出去！”“打倒吴庭艳卖国贼！”
    南越广大人民斗争怒火日益扩大
    新华社河内24日电　西贡消息：美国—吴庭艳集团违反日内瓦协议在去年5月颁布所谓“1959年第十号法令”以来，更加疯狂地迫害和残杀人民，特别是对前抗战根据地的人民，进行大规模“扫荡”，强迫人民
  “迁入稠密区”、“垦荒区”等变相集中营去。南越广大地区人民为求生存，纷纷起来采取各种方式，向残暴的美国—吴庭艳集团进行英勇的斗争，这种斗争的规模和声势正越来越大。
      美荻市街道上贴满反美标语
    在美荻省省会美荻市，前不久街道上贴满了写着“打倒侵略和好战的美帝国主义！”、
  “反对1959年第十号法令；”等口号的标语。同时，控诉美吴集团的罪行和动员人民起来反抗的传单到处出现。
    在美荻省的丐累、丐排、洲城、米市等县，成千上万的人最近也举行了示威游行，愤怒的群众高呼“美帝国主义滚出去！”
  “打倒吴庭艳卖国贼！”“坚决保卫土地！反对抓兵拉伕，反对成立‘稠密区’，反对建立美国军事基地；”等口号。许多人从“稠密区”跑出来参加游行，各地都举行罢工和罢市。
    槟椥省二千余群众到县府示威
    在受到大规模“扫荡”和残酷镇压的槟椥省，各地最近发生了二、三千人到县府示威的事件。他们要求惩办杀人凶手，为被美国—吴庭艳集团杀害的亲人偿命，要求释放他们被捕的父母、丈夫和儿子。被示威群众的声势吓坏了的伪县长企图逃跑时，曾被小孩、妇女和老人层层围住，在声势浩大的指责下，这个“县长”不得不当众承认了美国—吴庭艳集团的血腥罪行，并被迫释放了一部分被捕的人。
    美荻省丐?郡后美乡人民为了反对美吴集团替美国顾问去“视察”开路，派出一个营到那里进行“扫荡”，全乡男女老少群起反抗，许多人带了长矛、刀、棍子进行斗争。
      广南省群众展开反迫迁斗争
    在广南省的奠盘、大禄、和芝、维川和桂山等县，人民坚决反对迫迁集中到“稠密区”去。他们提出了“不去集中，坚决住在自己家园”的口号。许多村庄全村居民团结一致，阻止美国—吴庭艳集团拆毁人民的房子的行动。最近在被迫赶往西原“垦荒区”的承天省和同塔梅地区人民坚决反对在“垦荒区”过非人的生活，要求回家。他们举行罢工、绝食等团结一致的斗争，取得了初步胜利，当局被迫让他们回家。
  同塔梅地区人民夺回被抢土地和池塘
    南越前著名抗战根据地同塔梅地区的人民，最近同美国—吴庭艳集团进行英勇斗争的结果，夺回了几年来美吴集团所抢去的在抗战时期分得的土地和池塘。最近，同塔梅地区的人民在“防备美吴集团抢劫人民的田地和池塘”、“打倒美帝国主义侵略者和吴庭艳卖国贼！”的口号下组织了大规模的集会和示威游行。
    在金瓯省有一个村庄的人民在一个月中就进行了一百多次反对剥削、拉伕、迫迁和集中的斗争。许多地方居民还组织起来抵制当地的反动组织。每当有被怀疑的人进村的时候，就敲起木鱼普遍通知。有些村庄还把美吴集团挖掘的军用河渠填塞掉。
    在广南省维川县，当局抓走了一个人去参加所谓“控共学习”，立刻就有上百人起来阻止反抗。在有些“学习班”里，老人们起来当面严词谴责吴庭艳集团的屠杀罪行。
              美吴集团对人民斗争十分惊慌
    日益强大的人民斗争活动，使得美国—吴庭艳集团十分惊慌。合众国际社20日的一则西贡消息说，“这块平坦产米的地方（指南越）很不安全是一个确切的事实。”法国“世界报”前不久报道傀儡当局惊慌失措的情况说，在高原地区的一些公路上，巡逻的装甲车不断地行驶，有的时候，在某些地点汽车要被挡住一两个钟头，等待结成一队才敢在带着重机枪的汽车的掩护下继续行驶。美联社5月3日的消息承认，美国“军事顾问”认为人民的斗争“浪潮正在使南越和美国日益不安”，并且担心吴庭艳集团将“无法控制”局势。
