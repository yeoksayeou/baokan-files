Learn From Huanghua Salt Field

A great hundred-day salt-seizing competition against the heavens is underway among the vast number of salt industry workers in our country. In this competition, the Huanghua Salt Field in Hebei Province is taking the lead, creating a record of high-speed, large-area abundant production. As of June 5th, it had completed 72% of its annual production plan. The Huanghua Salt Field is now an advanced red flag in the salt-making industry and a model for all salt fields in the sea salt region to learn from. Learning from Huanghua, catching up with Huanghua, and surpassing Huanghua can allow us to take advantage of the current excellent salt-making opportunity to produce more salt for the country and better meet the needs of our chemical industry, animal husbandry, fisheries, and people's livelihoods for crude salt.

The Huanghua Salt Field is a newly built salt field. Compared to other salt fields of similar size (including old salt fields), it lacks power equipment and has a weak technical force. Last year, its production lagged behind other salt fields in Hebei Province. Therefore, some people once believed that it would be impossible for a newly established unit like the Huanghua Salt Field to catch up with other old salt fields in terms of production without the state increasing its power equipment or technical force. Now, the state has neither increased the power equipment nor the technical force for the Huanghua Salt Field, but the Huanghua Salt Field has moved to the forefront of other salt fields. The Huanghua Salt Field not only lacks the unique material and technical strength, but it also lacks the conditions possessed by other salt fields. The reason why the Huanghua Salt Field can take the lead and first complete 72% of its annual production plan is mainly the result of all employees, under the leadership of the Party, adhering to putting politics in command, going all out, overcoming difficulties, and fully发挥发挥 (fā huī) [giving full play to] the enthusiasm and creativity of the employees.

To learn from Huanghua Salt Field, the first thing to learn is their firm idea that man will conquer nature. The process of material production is originally a process of man fighting against nature and man conquering nature. In crude salt production, the struggle between man and nature is even more obvious. The size of the tide, the level of concentration, and the weather all have a direct impact on the level of crude salt production, and these natural phenomena are independent of people's will. In such a situation, what should we do? Should we completely submit to the forces of nature and wait for God to show mercy? Or should we muster our energy, actively understand the laws of nature, master them, utilize them, and fight stubbornly against nature? These are two completely different ideologies. The former is the idea of "relying on heaven for food," ignoring the subjective initiative of man; the latter is the idea of "man will conquer nature," which fully estimates the objective laws of nature and gives full play to man's subjective initiative. The employees of the Huanghua Salt Field have established this idea that man will conquer nature and actively understand and master the laws of weather changes. They considered that the weather has its good and bad sides, and they prepared "two hands" in production, both planning for good weather and arranging for bad weather. Planning for good weather is to maximize the role of favorable weather conditions and prevent possible unfavorable factors. Arranging for bad weather is to minimize the scope of unfavorable factors and turn unfavorable factors into favorable factors with the greatest effort. For example, in order to prepare sufficient salt-making raw materials, they organized a large army of thousands of people as early as winter to chisel ice and collect tides, and carry out mass brine-making campaigns to increase brine. Learning from Huanghua is learning their spirit of adhering to putting politics in command, boldly mobilizing the masses, actively understanding the laws of nature, mastering and applying the laws of nature, and constantly fighting against nature. We must establish the idea that man will conquer nature. Only in this way can we come up with ways to overcome nature and achieve high-speed, large-area abundant production.

Now is the peak season for sea salt production. In the past few months, the employees of each salt field have made great achievements in the hundred-day salt-seizing battle, laying the foundation for completing and overfulfilling this year's salt-making plan. As long as we learn from the advanced experience of Huanghua Salt Field and other salt fields, muster greater energy, the leadership goes deep into the front line of production, and grasps, tightens, and meticulously manages production, we will definitely be able to make even more outstanding achievements in the current favorable season! "The latecomer surpasses the former." Learning from Huanghua, catching up with Huanghua, and surpassing Huanghua is definitely achievable.

### 向黄骅盐场看齐

    向黄骅盐场看齐
    我国广大盐业职工正在开展一场与天争时的百日夺盐大竞赛。在这一场竞赛中，河北省黄骅盐场一马当先，创造了高速度、大面积丰产的纪录，到6月5日为止，已完成全年产量计划的72％。黄骅盐场是现在制盐工业中的一面先进红旗，是海盐区各个盐场学习的榜样。学黄骅、赶黄骅、超黄骅，就可以利用当前制盐的大好时机，为国家生产更多的盐，更好地满足我国化学工业、畜牧、渔业和人民生活对原盐的需要。
    黄骅盐场是一个新建盐场，比起规模相当的其他盐场（包括老盐场）来，动力设备不足，技术力量薄弱，去年它的生产落在河北省其他盐场后面。因此，曾经有人认为，像黄骅盐场这样新建单位，国家不给增加动力设备，不给增加技术力量，要在生产上赶上其他老盐场是不行的。现在呢，国家既没有给黄骅盐场增加动力设备，也没有给它增加技术力量，但黄骅盐场却赶到其他盐场的前头去了。黄骅盐场不但没有得天独厚的物质技术力量，而且连别的盐场所拥有的条件它都没有。黄骅盐场所以能一马当先，首先完成全年产量计划的72％，主要是全体职工在党的领导下，坚持政治挂帅，鼓足干劲，克服困难，充分发挥职工积极性创造性的结果。
    学黄骅盐场，首先要学的是他们坚定的人定胜天的思想。物质生产的发展过程，本来就是人和自然斗争、人征服自然的过程。在原盐生产中，人和自然的斗争更为明显。潮水的大小，浓度的高低，天气的好坏，对原盐产量的高低，都有直接的影响，而这些自然现象，又是不以人们的意志为转移的。在这样的情况下，怎么办呢？完全屈服在自然力的面前，等待天老爷开恩呢？还是鼓起干劲来，积极地认识自然规律，掌握它，利用它，顽强地跟自然作斗争？这是两种截然不同的意识形态。前一种是“靠天吃饭”思想，无视人的主观能动作用；后一种是“人定胜天”思想，既充分估计自然界的客观规律，又充分发挥人的主观能动作用。黄骅盐场的职工同志就树立了这种人定胜天思想，积极地认识和掌握天时变化的规律。他们考虑到天时有好有坏，在生产上就准备“两只手”，既作好天打算，又作坏天安排。作好天打算，为的是最大限度地利用有利天时的作用，防止可能发生的不利因素。作坏天的安排，为的是尽最大的努力缩小不利因素发生作用的范围，化不利因素为有利因素。例如，他们为了准备好充裕的制盐原料，早在冬季就组织了千人大军，凿冰纳潮，开展群众性的制卤运动，增加卤水。学黄骅，就是学习他们坚持政治挂帅，放手发动群众，积极认识自然规律，掌握和运用自然规律，跟自然作不断斗争的精神。我们必须树立人定胜天的思想，只有这样，才能想出战胜自然的办法，取得高速度的大面积丰产。
    现在正是海盐生产的旺季。在过去的几个月内，每个盐场的职工，都在百日夺盐大战中，做出了很大的成绩，为完成和超额完成今年制盐计划奠定了基础。只要好好地学习黄骅盐场和其他盐场的先进经验，鼓起更大的干劲，领导深入生产第一线，狠抓、紧抓、细抓生产，一定能够在当前有利的季节，做出更出色的成绩来！“后来者居上”，学黄骅、赶黄骅、超黄骅，是一定可以做到的。
