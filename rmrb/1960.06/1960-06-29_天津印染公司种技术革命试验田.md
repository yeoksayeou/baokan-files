The characteristics of this leadership method are: leading cadres go deep into the front line of production, jointly study, summarize, and improve advanced experiences with the masses, and at the same time, promptly concentrate the advanced experiences scattered in other units in the same industry into the "experimental plots" for mutual supplementation, mutual promotion, selection and finalization, integration, and then rapidly promote them.

Tianjin, June 28th (reported by this newspaper) – Leading cadres of the Tianjin Printing and Dyeing Industrial Company have been going deep into the front line of production to plant "experimental plots," accelerating the technological transformation of the entire industry, and changing the backward state of production in the entire industry in just over a month, achieving a large-scale bumper harvest. In May, after transferring three factories and more than 870 laborers from the company's eight dyeing and finishing factories to support fraternal industries, the company still overfulfilled its production plan, increasing by 8.52% compared to the same period last year. Comparing the first half of this year with the same period last year, output increased by 13.29%, output value increased by 20.33%, profit increased by 94.35%, labor productivity increased by 49.38%, and costs decreased by 4.5%. With the reduction of factories and personnel, the company's colored cloth output this year will increase by more than 49% compared to last year, and labor productivity will increase by 70%.

The company's innovation in leadership methods is to first plant "experimental plots" in one factory, establish a model standard-bearer in the entire industry, and then make a breakthrough at one point, lead the whole area, and quickly reap results in the entire industry. The factories under the Printing and Dyeing Industrial Company are all small and medium-sized dyeing and finishing factories, originally merged from more than 30 joint state-private small factories. Production was scattered, equipment was outdated, and technical strength was weak. During the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the factories put forward more than 10,000 innovation proposals, but some major innovation projects could not fully exert their power in production, and it was urgently necessary to consolidate, promote, and improve these innovation achievements.

Adapting to this new situation, the company's manager, deputy managers, and other leading cadres decided to go deep into the factories and workshops to explore the laws of the development of the movement. After gaining an in-depth understanding of the situation, they found that many major innovation projects in each factory had universal significance for the technological transformation of the entire industry, but they were scattered in various factories and processes, and could not be connected to comprehensively improve production. For example, the automatic console of the Huada Dyeing Factory could control the operation of several machines at the same time, but the factory was producing single machines, and could not apply it well; the Yongxing Dyeing Factory, due to the lack of an automatic console, although it created electromagnetic automatic switches and realized continuous automatic production from sewing to mercerization, from color drying to hanging codes, it could not take the segmented continuous production to a higher level. The company's leading cadres were enlightened by these facts, and after repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's works on "Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership," they more deeply understood the truth that Chairman Mao said, "All correct leadership must be from the masses, to the masses," and realized that summarizing and promoting advanced experiences also requires concentrating the scattered and unsystematic experiences of the masses, researching them, removing the dross and selecting the essence, turning them into concentrated and systematic experiences, integrating them, and then promoting them to the masses. Therefore, led by the manager and deputy managers, a special team was organized to go deep into the factories and, together with the factory's technical innovation experts, veteran workers, and technical personnel, appraise and supplement each experience, summarize and improve it. Finally, twenty-seven major innovation experiences scattered in various factory processes were selected, and a set of systematic experiences for the entire production process of a dyeing and finishing factory was initially assembled. Next, a promotion team for complete sets of innovation experiences, composed of veteran workers, innovation experts, and electricians from various factories, was organized, led by An Buzhou, the company's manager and Party branch secretary. The Yongxing Dyeing Factory, which had a relatively poor equipment foundation but was full of energy among the leading cadres and the masses, was selected as the "experimental plot," and the masses were mobilized with great fanfare to carry out a vigorous blitz battle for complete integration. Leading cadres personally directed, assigned people according to the items, and contracted each item. Soon, the major innovation experiences of automatic consoles, broken-end stoppers, automatic liquid controllers, and other factories blossomed and bore fruit in the Yongxing Dyeing Factory. However, in the end, the single-machine production dyeing vat was left without continuity, becoming the key to affecting the complete integration of the entire production line. Manager An Buzhou studied with the workers and, based on the operating experience of the veteran workers, proposed the method of rope dyeing. At that time, some technicians believed that this was a native method and could not succeed, and a gust of cold wind blew. However, with the support of the leaders and the enthusiasm of the workers, they withstood the cold wind and finally succeeded in trial production, making the entire production line an automatic line. The factory's daily production level increased by 44%, and labor was saved by 40%. This huge change took only seven days.

The "experimental plot" of the Yongxing Dyeing Factory became a model standard-bearer in the entire industry. The promotion team for complete sets of experiences immediately moved on and rushed to Huada, Yida, Xintai, and other dyeing factories one after another, using one point to lead the whole area, making breakthroughs one by one, and comprehensively promoting the experience of the Yongxing Dyeing Factory, so that advanced experience quickly blossomed and bore fruit in the entire industry. The production capacity of the entire industry suddenly increased by 40%, and the appearance was completely new.

    天津印染公司种技术革命试验田
    这种领导方法的特点是：领导干部深入到生产第一线，和群众共同研究、总结、提高先进经验，同时，又及时地把分散在同行业中其他单位的先进经验，集中到“试验田”里来，互相补充，互相促进，选择定型，成龙配套，再迅速推广开去。
    本报天津28日电　天津市印染工业公司领导干部深入生产第一线种“试验田”，加速了全行业的技术改造，一个多月改变了全行业的生产落后面貌，获得大面积丰收。5月份，在把全公司所属的八个染整工厂中的三个工厂、八百七十多名劳动力调出去支援了兄弟行业以后，仍然超额完成了生产计划，比去年同期增长8．52％。今年上半年与去年同期比较，产量增加13．29％，产值增加20．33％，利润增加94．35％，劳动生产率提高49 ．38％，成本降低4．5％。全公司在减厂、减人的情况下，今年的色布产量要比去年增长49％多，劳动生产率提高70％。
    这个公司革新领导方法是采取先下一个工厂种“试验田”，在全行业中树立起样板标兵，然后突破一点，以点带面，一厂开花，迅速在全行业结果。印染工业公司所属各厂都是中小型染整工厂，原是由三十多个公私合营小厂合并的。生产分散，设备陈旧落后，技术力量薄弱。在技术革新、技术革命运动中，各工厂提出了一万多件革新建议，但是一些重大革新项目不能在生产上充分发挥威力，迫切需要巩固、推广、提高这些革新成果。
    适应这种新形势，公司经理、副经理等领导干部决定深入到工厂和车间，摸索运动发展的规律。经过深入了解情况以后，他们发现各工厂有不少重大革新项目对全行业的技术改造有普遍意义，但都是分散在各工厂和工序里，不能连续起来，全面提高生产。如华大染厂的自动操纵台，能同时控制几个机器操作，而这个厂却是单机生产，不能很好地应用；永兴染厂由于没有自动操纵台，虽然创造了电磁自动开关，实现了从缝纫到丝光、从色干燥到挂码等几道工序的连续自动化生产，却不能把分段的连续化生产再提高一步。公司的领导干部从这些事实中受到了启发，又反复学习了毛主席“关于领导方法的若干问题”的著作，更深刻地体会到毛主席所说的“凡属正确的领导，必须是从群众中来，到群众中去”的道理，认识到总结推广先进经验，也需要把群众中分散的、不系统的经验，集中起来，经过研究，去粗存精，变为集中系统的经验，配套成龙，再拿到群众中去推广。于是以经理和副经理为首，组织了专门小组，深入到各厂，同工厂的技术革新能手、老工人、技术人员一起，对每一项经验进行鉴定和补充，加以总结提高，最后选出了分散在各工厂工序的二十七项重大革新经验，初步配成一套染整工厂整个生产过程的系统经验。接着，就组织了有各厂老工人、革新能手和电工参加的成套革新经验推广队，由公司经理、党支部书记安步洲挂帅，选择了设备基础比较差而领导干部和群众干劲十足的永兴染厂作“试验田”，大张旗鼓地发动群众，开展了声势浩大的成龙配套突击战，领导干部亲自指挥，按项定人，分项包干，很快就把各厂的自动操纵台、断头停车器、自动控制液量器等重大革新经验在永兴染厂开花结果。但是最后还剩下了单机生产的染槽没有连续化，成为影响生产全线成龙的关键。经理安步洲就和工人一起研究，根据老工人的操作经验，提出了采用绳状染色的办法。当时有些技术人员认为这是土办法，不能成功，吹起了一股冷风。但是有了领导的支持，工人的干劲，顶住了冷风，终于试制成功，使全程生产连成了一条自动线。全厂的日产水平提高了44％，劳动力节约了40％。这一巨大的变化只花了七天的时间。
    永兴染厂的“试验田”在全行业中成为样板标兵，成套经验推广队立即人不离鞍，马不停蹄，又陆续开赴华大、义大、信泰等染厂，以点带面，逐个突击，全面推广永兴染厂的经验，使先进经验迅速在全行业普遍开花结果。全行业的生产能力一下提高了40％，面貌一新。
