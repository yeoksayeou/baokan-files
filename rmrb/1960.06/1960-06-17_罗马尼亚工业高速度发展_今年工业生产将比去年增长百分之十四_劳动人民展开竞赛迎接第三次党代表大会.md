Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, June 16th: Currently, Romania's industrial production is developing at the highest speed in six years. According to the plan, Romania's overall industrial production will increase by 14% this year compared to last year, reaching the highest speed of Romanian industrial production in the last six years.

It is expected that the task put forward by the Second Congress of the Romanian Workers' Party to increase industrial production by 60%-65% between 1956 and 1960 will be successfully completed this year.

In recent years, the Romanian Party and government have continued to implement the national industrialization policy of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, and have paid special attention to the development of major industrial sectors such as machine manufacturing, steel, electricity, chemicals, and petroleum. At present, the steel produced every 63 days, the machines manufactured every 42 days, and the electricity generated every 60 days in Romania are equal to the annual output of these products in 1938.

In recent years, the Romanian steel industry has achieved tremendous development. A series of important equipment has been put into production during this period, including a large blast furnace with an annual pig iron production 50% higher than the national output in 1938, the Roman Steel Pipe Plant, one of the largest steel pipe plants in Europe, and a modern coking plant with a coke production accounting for more than 50% of the national total. In 1959, Romania's steel output reached more than 1.41 million tons, an increase of 85% compared to 1955 and 52% compared to 1958, which is the fastest growth rate in the past nine years.

This year, the production of Romania's machine manufacturing industry will increase by more than double compared to 1955. Before liberation, 95% of the machinery and equipment used in Romania were imported, but now, its machine manufacturing industry can produce more than 1,000 kinds of products. The various machinery and equipment it now produces can not only meet domestic needs, but also rank second in export trade this year. Raising production technology and product quality to world levels is the current goal of Romanian machine manufacturing workers.

The implementation of the ten-year electrification plan has guaranteed the tremendous development of Romania's power industry. The task of producing 1.7 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity in 1960, as stipulated in the plan, was nearly completed last year, and this year's output will exceed the above plan by 10%. In order to meet the needs of the rapid development of the national economy, the construction of some large power stations is currently being accelerated.

The chemical industry is an industrial sector that Romania has attached great importance to in recent years. During the period from 1956 to 1959, the production of the chemical industry approximately doubled. In the future, Romania's production of synthetic fibers, synthetic rubber, and plastics will have great development.

In recent years, Romania has made great achievements in petroleum exploration, promotion of advanced oil extraction methods, and the most effective utilization of petroleum. Due to the increase in petroleum processing equipment, Romania is now able to process all the petroleum it produces.

Romanian industry has provided tremendous support to agriculture. In the three years from 1956 to 1958, the output of agricultural machinery and equipment increased by nearly two times. Now, there are sixteen factories across the country producing various agricultural machinery and equipment such as tractors and combine harvesters.

Since the Second Congress of the Romanian Workers' Party in 1955, these tremendous achievements made by Romanian industry have been inseparable from the socialist production competition movement and technological innovation movement carried out in the same year. Through these mass movements, the labor enthusiasm of the workers and staff has been greatly stimulated, advanced production methods have been promoted, and labor productivity has been improved.

Currently, the Romanian people are carrying out a socialist competition movement with unprecedented labor enthusiasm. They want to use new production achievements to greet the upcoming Third Congress of the Romanian Workers' Party.

    罗马尼亚工业高速度发展
    今年工业生产将比去年增长百分之十四
    劳动人民展开竞赛迎接第三次党代表大会
    新华社布加勒斯特16日电  目前，罗马尼亚的工业生产正在以六年来最高的速度向前发展。按计划规定，今年罗马尼亚整个工业生产将比去年增长14％，从而达到罗马尼亚工业生产最近六年来的最高速度。
    预计，罗马尼亚工人党第二次代表大会提出的在1956—1960年间把工业生产提高60％—65％的任务，将在今年顺利完成。
    最近几年来，罗马尼亚党和政府继续贯彻了优先发展重工业的国家工业化政策，特别注意发展了机器制造、钢铁、电力、化学、石油等主要工业部门。目前，罗马尼亚每六十三天生产的钢、每四十二天制造的机器、每六十天发出的电力，就等于1938年这些产品的全年产量。
    近年来，罗马尼亚钢铁工业获得了巨大的发展，在这一时期有一系列的重要设备投入了生产，其中包括年产生铁比1938年全国产量还多50％的一座大型高炉，欧洲最大钢管厂之一的罗曼钢管厂和一座产焦量占全国总产量50％以上的现代化炼焦厂等。在1959年，罗马尼亚的钢产量达到了一百四十一万多吨，比1955年增长了85％，比1958年增长了52％，这是过去九年来最快的增长速度。
    今年罗马尼亚机器制造业的生产将比1955年增长一倍多。解放前，罗马尼亚使用的95％的机器设备都是进口的，而现在，它的机器制造业能生产一千种以上的产品，它现在生产的各种机器设备不但能满足国内的需要，而且在今年出口贸易中已跃居第二位。把生产技术和产品质量提高到世界水平——这是当前罗马尼亚机器制造工人的奋斗目标。
    十年电气化计划的执行保证了罗马尼亚电力工业的巨大发展。计划规定1960年生产十七亿度电的任务，在去年已接近完成，今年的产量将超过上述计划的10％。为了适应国民经济迅速发展的需要，目前正在加速建设一些大型发电站。
    化学工业是近年来罗马尼亚十分重视的一个工业部门。在1956年到1959年期间，化学工业的生产约增长了一倍。今后，罗马尼亚人造纤维、人造橡胶和塑料等的生产，将有很大的发展。
    最近几年来，罗马尼亚在石油勘探、推广先进采油方法和最有效地利用石油等方面都取得了很大成绩。由于石油加工设备的增加，罗马尼亚现在已能加工所生产的全部石油。
    罗马尼亚工业对农业进行了巨大的支援。在1956年到1958年的三年中，农业机器设备的产量增长了将近两倍。现在全国有十六个工厂生产着拖拉机、谷物联合收割机等各种农业机器设备。
    自1955年罗马尼亚工人党第二次代表大会以来，罗马尼亚工业所取得的这些巨大成就，是同年年进行的社会主义生产竞赛运动和技术革新运动分不开的。通过这些群众运动，大大激发了职工的劳动热情，推广了先进生产方法，提高了劳动生产率。
    目前，罗马尼亚人民正以空前高涨的劳动热情开展着社会主义竞赛运动。他们要用新的生产成就来迎接即将召开的罗马尼亚工人党的第三次代表大会。
