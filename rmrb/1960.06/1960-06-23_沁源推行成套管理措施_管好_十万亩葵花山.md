Qinyuan Implements Comprehensive Management Measures
Manage the "100,000 Mu Sunflower Mountain"

(Our report) Qinyuan County, Shanxi Province, launched a mass movement to create a "100,000 Mu Sunflower Mountain" this spring, planting a total of 100,120 mu of castor and sunflowers.

In order to ensure a good harvest of minor oil crops, the county organized a specialized team of more than 44,000 people, implementing a contracted responsibility system by area, with all-inclusive management. They also formulated a complete set of management measures, which are gradually implemented according to the seasonal timing and seedling growth. These measures are: (1) When the seedlings grow to about three inches, perform the first thinning and weeding; when they grow to five to seven inches, perform the second weeding and seedling fixing. (2) From the summer solstice to before the major heat, carry out two cultivations and topdressing. (3) Open wells and dig ponds to increase water sources, prevent drought, and protect seedlings. (4) For edible sunflowers, promptly remove branches to reduce unfilled grains. (5) Prevent lodging. (6) Harvest in a timely manner to prevent losses.

    沁源推行成套管理措施
    管好“十万亩葵花山”
    本报讯　山西省沁源县今春大搞“十万亩葵花山”的群众运动，共种蓖麻、向日葵十万零一百二十亩。
    为了确保小油料丰收，这个县共组织了四万四千多人的专业队，实行划片包干，一包到底的管理办法，并且制定了一整套管理措施，根据季节时令和苗子生长情况，逐步付诸实施。这套办法就是：（一）幼苗长至三寸左右时，进行第一次间苗、锄草；长至五至七寸时，进行第二次锄草、定苗。（二）从夏至到大暑前，进行两次中耕和追肥。（三）开井挖池，增加水源，防旱保苗。（四）对食用向日葵，及时打掉枝杈，减少秕粒。（五）防止倒伏。（六）及时摘收，防止损失。
