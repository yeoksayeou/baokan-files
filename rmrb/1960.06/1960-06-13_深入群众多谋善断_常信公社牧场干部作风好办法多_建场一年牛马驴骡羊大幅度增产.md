Go Deep Among the Masses, Seek Advice and Make Decisive Decisions
Changxin Commune Ranch Cadres Have a Good Work Style and Many Methods
Major Increase in Cattle, Horses, Donkeys, Mules, and Sheep Production in the First Year of Construction

(Reported by this newspaper) Since its establishment a year ago, the Changxin Commune Livestock Farm in Helan County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, has increased its large livestock such as cattle, horses, donkeys, and mules from 279 to the current 375, a net increase of 34%; Tan sheep have increased from 1,021 to 1,546, a net increase of 51.4%; all kinds of livestock, large and small, have achieved "every herd is fat and healthy, and every pen is full of pregnancies without disease."

What is the reason for the outstanding performance of this livestock farm? The main reason is that the leading cadres of the commune and the farm have always adhered to putting politics in command and vigorously grasping ideological education work since the beginning of the farm's construction. For example, some herdsmen were initially unaccustomed to the farm life and were not at ease with their work; some inseminators believed that doing insemination work was "lowly" and "shameful," etc. In response to these thoughts, the commune Party committee and the farm Party branch repeatedly educated the herdsmen on "taking the farm as home" and "insemination is glorious." Veterinarian Lu Shan was not at ease with his work on the farm, so Qian Jinyuan, the first secretary of the commune Party committee, Sun Huanlin, the deputy head of the commune, and others talked to him kindly every time they inspected the work, asking him to strengthen his political study, which finally made Lu Shan gradually settle down to work. Last winter, herdsman Zhang Shan lost eight cattle while grazing, and the farm did not find them all until the next day. The Party branch seized on this incident, organized the herdsmen to discuss "whether it is right to lose livestock" and "how not to lose livestock," summarized and exchanged grazing experience, and put forward the "three diligences" (diligent legs, diligent mouth, diligent eyes) grazing rules for herdsmen. Since then, the farm has never had another livestock loss accident.

The leading cadres of this ranch actively participate in production and lead production. When the ranch was building sheds in the wasteland and had no wood, Dai Cunfu, the secretary of the branch, led the herdsmen to build more than 30 sheds using stones and dead branches, ensuring the safe wintering of the livestock. At the beginning of insemination, Dai Cunfu personally took the lead in pulling the matching equipment and patiently taught the inseminators the technique, so that the insemination work of the whole farm was immediately carried out. Last autumn, when a mountain flood occurred, the farm's horses were grazing in the gully. At that time, some people were at a loss and thought that the horses would definitely be drowned by the flood. But at this critical moment, the branch secretary made a decisive decision and said to everyone: "Horses are the property of the commune, and we must not let them be lost!" With that, he led the herdsmen into the gully in the pouring rain. Some of them had their feet broken by stones, and their legs were scratched by thorns, but they finally rescued the horses. When the farm was first built, there was no grassland planning, and forage was lacking, with weak livestock accounting for 60%. In order to change this situation, Dai Cunfu and Song Zhanxiang, the head of the farm, surveyed the grassland with the herdsmen during the day, studied ways to improve feeding management, and got up several times at night to add grass and feed to the livestock. During the busy season of lambing this spring, they worked with the herdsmen every day to deliver lambs and feed the lambs with milk. They also usually participate with the herdsmen in cleaning livestock pens, cutting grass, planting fields, and cooking. Therefore, the herdsmen praised their secretary and farm manager as "one person兼 three staff members (inseminator, breeder, administrator), doing all the hard and dirty work."

Under the leadership of the farm Party branch, all the staff of the farm summarized a complete set of scientific livestock feeding management methods, implemented a "five-fixed" system of fixed special person for grazing, fixed herds, fixed pens, fixed zoning rotation, and fixed leadership, and a "four-combination" method of combining politics and technology, combining grazing and barn feeding, combining artificial insemination and natural mating, and combining prevention and treatment. They also implemented separate feeding of different herds, large and small, strong and weak, and a system of inspection and acceptance of livestock when they come out of and enter the pens, and adopted different grazing methods according to the seasons, grasslands, and livestock characteristics. In this way, the high-speed development of farm production was guaranteed from the technical management.

The Changxin Commune Party Committee and the farm Party branch also paid special attention to the lives of the masses. When the farm was first built, the commune Party committee, considering the poor living conditions on the farm, transported more than 7,000 kilograms of vegetables to the herdsmen, and appropriately increased the vegetable money for the staff. The herdsmen ran all over the mountains and beaches with livestock all day long, so the commune gave each herdsman half a catty of hemp and some shoe soles for them to make shoes. The ranch purchased kettles and raincoats for the herdsmen who needed to carry water and rain gear when they went out to graze. Last winter, herdsman Wang Zhankui suffered from back pain, so the ranch sent him to the hospital for treatment. During Wang Zhankui's convalescence, the ranch also sent him mutton and vegetables. Soon, Wang Zhankui recovered and was discharged from the hospital. As soon as he stepped into the ranch, he said to Secretary Dai with tears in his eyes: "The ranch takes better care of me than my family." Because the leaders grasped production with one hand and life with the other, the whole farm formed a close-knit, intimate relationship between cadres and the masses, and production was active.

    深入群众多谋善断
    常信公社牧场干部作风好办法多
    建场一年牛马驴骡羊大幅度增产
    本报讯　宁夏回族自治区贺兰县常信公社畜牧场建场一年来，牛、马、驴、骡等大家畜，由二百七十九头发展到目前的三百七十五头，净增殖34％；滩羊由一千零二十一只发展到一千五百四十六只，净增殖51．4％；各种大小家畜达到了“群群膘肥无乏瘦，圈圈满怀无疫情”。
    这个畜牧场办得这般出色，原因何在呢？主要是这个公社和牧场的领导干部，从建场开始，始终坚持政治挂帅，狠抓思想教育工作。例如，有的牧工开始不习惯牧场生活，不安心工作；有的配种员认为搞配种工作“下贱”、“丢人”等等。公社党委和牧场党支部针对这些思想，向牧工反复进行了“以场为家”、“配种光荣”的教育。兽医路山不安心牧场工作，公社党委第一书记钱金元、副社长孙焕林等就在每次检查工作时，亲切地和他谈话，要他加强政治学习，终于使路山逐渐安心工作。去年冬天，牧工张山放牧回来不小心丢失了八头牛，牧场直到第二天才找齐。党支部抓住这件事，组织牧工讨论“丢了牲畜对不对”、“怎样才不丢牲畜”，总结交流了放牧经验，提出了“三勤”（腿勤、嘴勤、眼勤）的放牧员守则，此后，牧场再未发生过丢失牲畜的事故。
    这个牧场的领导干部积极参加生产，领导生产。牧场在荒滩上修盖圈棚没有木料，支部书记戴存福就带领牧工，利用石头和枯树枝修搭了三十多个圈棚，保证了牲畜安全过冬。开始配种时，戴存福亲自带头拉配，并耐心教给配种员技术，使全场配种工作立即开展起来。去年秋季发生山洪时，场里的马群正在山沟里吃草，当时有些人束手无策，认为马匹一定会被洪水淹死。但支部书记在这紧张关头，当机立断，对大家说：“马匹是公社的财产，绝不能让它损失！”说着他领着牧工们冒着倾盆大雨，向山沟奔去。他们中间有的人被石头碰破了脚，腿被荆棘刺破了，但终于把马群抢救出来。刚建场时，草原没有规划，饲草缺乏，乏弱牲畜占60％。为了改变这种状况，戴存福和场长宋占祥，白天和牧工一起勘查草原，研究改善饲养管理方法，夜里还几次起来为牲畜加草添料。今年春季羊只产羔大忙季节，他们天天同牧工一起接羔，给小羊配奶。他们平常还和牧工们一起参加清扫畜圈、打草、种田、作饭。因此牧工们称赞他们的书记和场长是“一身兼三员（配种员、饲养员、管理员），苦活、脏活无所不干”。
    在牧场党支部的领导下，全场职工总结了一整套科学的牲畜饲养管理方法，实行了固定专人放牧，固定畜群，固定圈棚、固定划区轮放，固定领导的“五定”制度，和政治与技术结合，放牧与舍饲结合，人工授精与本交结合，预防与治疗结合的“四结合”办法，还实行了不同畜群、大小强弱分群饲养，出圈入圈检查验牧制度，并根据季节、草原及牲畜特点，采取了不同的放牧方法。这样就从技术管理上保证了牧场生产的高速度发展。
    常信公社党委和牧场党支部还特别关心群众生活。初建场时，公社党委考虑到牧场生活条件较差，就给牧工运去蔬菜七千多斤，并且适当增加了职工的菜金。放牧员整天赶着牲畜满山满滩跑，公社就发给每个牧工半斤麻和一些鞋掌子，供他们做鞋用。放牧员出外放牧需要带水和防雨设备，牧场就给购置了水壶、雨衣。去年冬季，放牧员王占奎患了腰痛病，牧场就送他到医院治疗。王占奎疗养期间，牧场还给他送去羊肉、蔬菜，不久，王占奎恢复健康出院，他刚踏进牧场就热泪盈眶地向戴书记说：“场里照顾得比我家里还好”。由于领导上一手抓生产，一手抓生活，因而全场形成了干部群众心连心，亲密无间，生产积极。
