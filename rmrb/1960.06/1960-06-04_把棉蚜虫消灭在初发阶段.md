    Eliminate Cotton Aphids in the Early Stages of Infestation
    Currently, in most parts of the country, cotton has emerged and begun to sprout true leaves. While strengthening cotton field management and striving for full and robust seedlings, we must seize the favorable opportunity to thoroughly control cotton aphids and eliminate them in the early, localized stages of infestation.
    Cotton aphids spread quickly and cause serious damage, making them a major enemy of cotton. After cotton aphids appear, they cause cotton seedlings to curl and their growth to stagnate. If cotton seedlings cannot grow and develop normally, they cannot produce early buds, bloom, and produce more cotton bolls, which will greatly affect cotton production.
    This spring was relatively dry and the temperature was high, which is conducive to the development of insect pests. According to some typical investigation materials, the number of cotton pests surviving the winter this year is higher than in previous years, and they hatched earlier. For example, in Shaanxi Province, the number of cotton aphid eggs this year is twice as many as in previous years, and the hatching period is about ten days earlier. At present, cotton aphids in many areas are migrating to cotton fields, and in some areas the momentum is very strong and the spread is very fast, increasing several times in three days. Therefore, all localities must seize the opportunity and prevent and control them as early as possible. If cotton plants with aphids are not treated early, they will become curled-leaf plants in ten days, resulting in reduced production. Leading departments at all levels in cotton-producing areas, especially people's communes and production teams, should immediately grasp the prevention and control of cotton aphids and check the pest situation and various preparations at any time. In areas where cotton aphids have already appeared in localized patches, pest control teams should be quickly sent to the front line of aphid eradication and seedling protection to completely eliminate cotton aphids in the localized stages. Early treatment saves labor, effort, and pesticides, and ensures that cotton growth is not affected, which is a good way to achieve twice the result with half the effort. In northern areas, we should take advantage of the favorable opportunity before wheat harvesting to conduct a general treatment of cotton aphids; after wheat harvesting, we should continue to do a good job in eliminating residual aphids according to the pest situation.
    This year, there are more favorable conditions for completely eliminating cotton aphid damage than in previous years, the experience of preventing and controlling cotton aphids in various places is richer, and the material conditions for preventing and controlling cotton aphids are also better than in previous years. As long as we make full use of these favorable conditions and strengthen organizational leadership, we will be able to completely eliminate cotton aphids and strive for a bumper cotton harvest.

    把棉蚜虫消灭在初发阶段
    现在全国大部分地区棉花已经齐苗出土，开始吐真叶。当前在加强棉田管理，争取苗全苗壮的同时，要抓住有利时机，彻底防治棉蚜虫，把棉蚜虫消灭在初发生的点片阶段。
    棉蚜虫蔓延快，危害严重，是棉花的大敌。棉蚜发生后，会使棉苗卷叶，生长停滞。棉苗不能正常生长发育，就不能提前现蕾、开花和多结棉桃，当然要大大影响棉花产量。
    今年春天较干旱，气温较高，有利于虫害的发展。据一些典型调查材料，今年棉花害虫要比往年越冬存活的数量多，孵化早。例如陕西省，今年棉蚜卵比往年多二倍，孵化期提早十天左右。目前，不少地区棉蚜正在向棉田迁移，而且有些地区来势很猛，蔓延很快，三天内增长了几倍。因此，各地必须抓紧时机，及早防治。现在有蚜虫的棉株，如不早治，十天以后就会变成卷叶株，造成减产。产棉区各级领导部门，尤其是各人民公社和生产队，应该立即抓紧棉蚜的防治工作，要随时检查虫情和各项准备工作。棉蚜已经有点片发生的地区，要把治虫专业队迅速开上灭蚜保苗的战线，把棉蚜彻底消灭在点片阶段。早治，既省工省力省药，又能使棉花生长不受影响，是个事半功倍的好办法。北方地区，应利用麦收前这一段有利时机，进行一次棉蚜的普治工作；麦收以后，根据虫情，再继续做好扫残工作。
    今年彻底消灭棉蚜为害的有利条件比往年多，各地防治棉蚜的经验更为丰富，防治棉蚜的物质条件也比往年更好。只要充分利用这些有利条件，加强组织领导，一定能够彻底消灭棉蚜虫，争取棉花大丰收。
