Xinhua News Agency, June 21st: Amidst the triumphant news of artillery fire driving away the god of plague, literary and art workers in Beijing and from other places across the country are taking up their artistic weapons with fervent passion to oppose the war conspiracies of American imperialism. Over the past few days, many literary and art troupes have been working day and night to create a large number of diverse artistic programs with the theme of opposing American imperialism. This evening, they performed in the streets and alleys of the capital, vividly exposing the essence of American imperialism's false peace and true war preparations to the broad masses, igniting an even higher tide of anti-American anger among the people. This street performance became an important part of the first day of the capital's "Propaganda Week Against American Imperialist Aggression, Resolutely Liberating Taiwan, and Defending World Peace."

In front of the Monument to the People's Heroes in Tiananmen Square, the performance by actors from the "August First" Film Studio began at just after 4:00 PM. The masses, braving the scorching sun, formed circles to watch. When the large-scale living newspaper play "Eisenhower Get Out" depicted people around the world putting a noose around the necks of Eisenhower and his running dogs, the audience and actors together raised their arms and shouted "Down with American Imperialism," "Eisenhower Get Out," and "Resolutely Liberate Taiwan!"

Actors such as Tian Hua and Zhang Yongshou recited the poem "Open Fire on the God of Plague" by the poet Yuan Ying. Tian Hua said that Eisenhower's provocation against the people of Asia and his engagement in war conspiracies in Taiwan and elsewhere cannot be tolerated by the people of the world. We must expose the conspiracy of American imperialism's false peace and true war preparations. She said that she was very excited to hear the news of the People's Liberation Army shelling Jinmen, and expressed her determination to use artistic weapons like artillery shells to strike down American imperialism. After the actors' troupe from the "August First" Film Studio finished their performance here, the China Youth Art Theater, the China Acrobatic Troupe, and the Air Force Political Department Song and Dance Troupe jointly performed many programs here, including the Beijing Opera living newspaper play "The Plague God's Eastern Tour." Some of the actors had previously participated in the shelling of Jinmen on the Fujian front lines. When they saw the news published in the newspaper about sending off the god of plague with a barrage of artillery fire, they felt very happy and immediately wrote this living newspaper play, incorporating their personal experiences of firing artillery on the front lines into the script.

On the square in front of the Working People's Cultural Palace, the delegation members from Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Sichuan, and Anhui, who remained in Beijing after participating in the National Workers' Art Festival, organized a joint propaganda team of more than 100 people and performed six programs including singing, recitations and living newspaper plays. When the living newspaper play depicted Eisenhower and Hagerty being surrounded by the masses, the surrounding audience also raised their fists and gathered around, becoming more and more tightly packed. They also became actors, and the actors and the audience shouted slogans such as "Down with American Imperialism" together. After the end of the play, the crowd was filled with indignation, and the audience was reluctant to leave for a long time.

More than one hundred students from the Beijing Coal Mine Art School performed poetry recitations, choruses, living newspaper plays, crosstalk, satirical singing, clapper talks, and mime shows at the Beijing Railway Station, attracting many local residents and travelers at the station. Cao Yunping and Lu Zijie, members of the Jianguomen People's Commune, pointed to the American depicted in the program and said that the American robbers in Beijing in the past were just as tyrannical and domineering. They clearly remembered the various crimes committed by American soldiers at that time in the Jianguomen area, such as running over Chinese people with cars and refusing to take responsibility, and raping women in Dongdan Square. Cao Yunping said to the audience next to her: It is necessary to stop American imperialism from launching wars of aggression, and Taiwan must be liberated; if American imperialism dares to launch wars of aggression, the people of the world will unite and surely eliminate them.

This evening, there were also street performances by literary and art workers outside Andingmen and in Tiananmen Square.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 21st: Eisenhower's gangster trip to the Far East has aroused unparalleled anger among cultural and artistic workers in Guangzhou. They have been creating and performing literary and artistic programs with the theme of opposing American imperialism and its war leader, Eisenhower.

At 9:00 PM on the 19th, Cantonese opera, Beijing opera, drama, opera, dance, and folk art troupes from across the city took to the streets with their own created programs to carry out literary and artistic propaganda activities in various districts of the city. Many amateur artistic teams also raised banners with the slogan "Eisenhower Get Out of Taiwan" and joined the performance teams of professional artistic groups, forming countless propaganda teams. Wherever these propaganda teams went, they beat gongs and drums and performed in costumes, arousing the people's strong hatred for American imperialism. On and off the stage, fists were raised together, and slogans were shouted in unison. Some audience members on Fengyuan Road shouted slogans and said: If Eisenhower, this robber, dares to make a move, we will beat him until his head is broken and bleeding.

All cinemas in the city screened films related to opposing American imperialist aggression, resolutely liberating Taiwan, and defending world peace on the 19th. The Xinhua Bookstore's branches dispatched sixteen propaganda teams to publicize and sell books exposing the history and acts of aggression by American imperialism on Zhongshan Road, Yonghan Road, and the main transportation routes of Dongshan.

Since the evening of the 18th, all art troupes in the city have been creating and rehearsing literary and artistic programs overnight with the theme of opposing American imperialist aggression and driving Eisenhower out of Asia and out of Taiwan. The Guangdong Drama Troupe created and adapted seven living newspaper plays and small songs overnight; the Guangdong Cantonese Opera Institute created a large-scale one-act play "Sweeping Away the God of Plague," small living newspaper plays "Opposing American Imperialist Aggression" and "Eisenhower Get Out," as well as more than twenty other forms of programs. While creating, the group's art office sent dedicated personnel to distribute the works to various groups for rehearsal in the middle of the night. The newly established Guangzhou Drama Troupe was also full of fighting spirit, creating seven or eight programs such as the performance song "We Will Definitely Liberate Taiwan" overnight.

    北京广州街头巷尾广泛展开反美宣传活动
    文艺团体街头演出戳穿美帝画皮
    新华社21日讯　在万炮怒发轰逐瘟神的捷报声中，北京和外地来京的文艺工作者怀着激昂的心情，拿起文艺武器，反对美帝国主义的战争阴谋。许多文艺团体连日来夜以继日地编排了大批以反对美帝为内容的多种形式的文艺节目，今天傍晚在首都各处街头巷尾演出，通过生动的形象向广大群众揭露了美帝国主义的假和平、真备战的本质，鼓起了群众更高的反美怒潮。这次街头演出成了首都人民“反对美帝侵略、坚决解放台湾、保卫世界和平宣传周”第一天中的重要内容。
    天安门人民英雄纪念碑前面，今日下午四点多钟，就出现“八一”电影制片厂的演员的演出。群众冒着火热的太阳围起圈子来。当大型活报剧“艾森豪威尔滚回去”中表演全世界人民用绞索套上艾森豪威尔和他的走狗的脖子的时候，观众和演员一起振臂高呼“打倒美帝国主义”、“艾森豪威尔滚回去”、“坚决解放台湾！”
    田华、张勇手等演员朗诵了诗人袁鹰的作品“向瘟神开炮”。田华说，这次艾森豪威尔向亚洲人民挑衅，到台湾等地搞战争阴谋，是全世界人民不能容忍的，我们一定要揭露美帝假和平真备战的阴谋，她说她听到解放军炮轰金门的消息很兴奋，表示要用文艺武器像炮弹一样来打倒美帝国主义。“八一”制片厂演员剧团在这里演完了节目以后，中国青年艺术剧院、中国杂技团、空军政治部文工团三个单位接着在这里联合演出了京剧活报“瘟神东游记”等许多节目。演员中有些人过去曾在福建前线参加过炮击金门。这次他们看到报上刊载万炮齐发送瘟神的消息后，感到大快人心，立即编写了这个活报剧，把他们亲自在前线打炮的情况编到了剧本中去。
    在劳动人民文化宫前面的广场上，参加全国职工文艺会演后留京的河北、内蒙古、四川、安徽四个代表团，组织了有一百多人参加的联合宣传队，演出了演唱、活报等六个节目。当活报剧中演到艾森豪威尔、哈格蒂被群众包围的场面时，四周观众也高举拳头围拢起来，越围越紧，他们也成了演员，演员和观众一起高呼打倒美帝国主义等口号。剧终以后，群情激愤，观众们久久不肯散去。
    北京煤矿艺术学院的一百多个学生在北京车站演出了诗歌朗诵、合唱、活报、相声、讽刺演唱、快书、哑剧等节目，吸引了当地许多居民以及车站上的旅客。建国门人民公社的社员曹云屏和吕子杰指着节目中出现的美国佬说，过去在北京的美国强盗就是这副横凶霸道的样子。他们清楚地记得美国军人那时在建国门一带开汽车压死了中国人不认账，在东单广场强奸妇女等种种罪行。曹云屏对她旁边的观众说：一定要制止美帝国主义发动侵略战争，台湾一定要解放；如果美帝国主义胆敢发动侵略战争，全世界人民团结起来，一定会消灭他们。
    今天傍晚，在安定门外和前门广场，也都有文艺工作者的街头演出。
    新华社广州21日电　艾森豪威尔在远东的强盗旅行，激起了广州市文化艺术工作者无比的愤怒。他们纷纷创作、演出以反对美帝国主义和它的战争头子艾森豪威尔为题材的文艺节目。
    19日晚九时，全市粤剧、京剧、话剧、歌剧、舞蹈、曲艺等艺术团体都带着自己创作的节目走上街头，在市内各区开展了文艺宣传活动。许多业余文艺队伍也高举“艾森豪威尔滚出台湾去”的标语参加到专业艺术团体的演出队伍里来，形成无数支宣传队。这些宣传队所到之处，都敲起锣鼓，化装表演，引起群众对美帝国主义强烈的仇恨，台上台下拳头齐举，同呼口号。逢源路有的观众一边呼口号，一边说：要是艾森豪威尔这个强盗敢动一动手，我们就要打得它头破血流。
  全市各电影院在19日就上映有关反对美帝侵略、坚决解放台湾、保卫世界和平的影片；新华书店各门市部派出了十六个宣传队，在中山路、永汉路、东山各交通要道宣传和出售揭露美帝侵略历史、侵略行为的书籍。
    全市各艺术团体从18日晚间起，连夜进行创作、排练以反对美帝国主义侵略、把艾森豪威尔赶出亚洲、赶出台湾为题材的文艺节目。广东话剧团在一夜间创作、改编了活报剧和小演唱七个；广东粤剧院创作了大型独幕话剧“扫瘟神”、小型活报剧“反对美帝侵略”和“艾森豪威尔滚出去”以及其他各种形式节目二十多个。这个团艺术室在深夜一边创作，一边派专人把作品分送各团排练。成立不久的广州话剧团，也是斗志昂扬，一夜创作了表演唱“一定解放台湾”等七、八个节目。
