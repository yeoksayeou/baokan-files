    Make Flood Prevention Preparations Early

    The southern provinces of our country have already entered the flood season, and the flood season in the northern provinces will follow closely. The annual flood prevention struggle has begun.

    This year's flood prevention struggle faces some new situations that are different from previous years. In the past, flood prevention tasks mainly focused on the dikes along the middle and lower reaches of rivers. Since the Great Leap Forward, especially in the past year and this year, various regions have built many reservoirs. The large number of completed reservoirs have played a decisive role in containing floods, irrigating farmland, and transforming water hazards into water resources. This is an advantage that did not exist in the past. Precisely because of this, the importance of reservoir flood prevention is particularly prominent. In some provinces, the total length of reservoir dams greatly exceeds the total length of river dikes in the past, and most are scattered in mountainous areas. How to ensure the safety of completed and under-construction reservoirs and maximize their potential benefits is an important task in this year's flood prevention struggle. In terms of river flood prevention, due to the large amount of runoff intercepted by reservoirs and the gradual control of river key projects, the water situation in the downstream reaches of rivers has also changed. Many past hazardous sections have become normal sections, and some past normal sections may become hazardous sections. We cannot only see the favorable conditions and ignore the various new situations. Therefore, attention should still be paid to river flood prevention work.

    Flood prevention is an arduous struggle between humans and nature, and this struggle is related to the safety of the lives and property of millions of people and the speed of the country's economic construction and development. Although our water conservancy construction has made great achievements in the past ten years, especially in recent years, greatly enhancing the material strength to overcome floods and win the victory in flood prevention, there should still be no negligence or complacency. It should be understood that water conservancy construction is a long-term struggle between mankind and nature. Although many areas can now overcome general floods and droughts, they cannot completely control particularly large floods, and particularly large floods may occur every year. Flood prevention is like combat, and we must "plan for the worst and strive for the best." We must have countermeasures and methods for all types of floods, and resolutely ensure that no dams collapse and no breaches occur. The safety of large and medium-sized reservoirs and important sections of major rivers must be ensured. On the premise of ensuring safety, we will continue to implement the policy of "focusing on storage, overall planning, and comprehensive utilization" to maximize the role of completed water conservancy projects in terms of flood prevention and benefits.

    Reservoir flood prevention is the focus of this year's flood prevention work, and arrangements must be made before the flood season. For reservoirs that are planned to contain floods this year, have been closed, but whose dams have not been filled to the flood control level, all effective measures must be taken to speed up the project progress, race against the arrival of floods, and prepare preventive measures for the early arrival of floods to ensure safety; reservoirs that are not sure to contain floods during this year's flood season must be postponed until after the flood season. For reservoirs under construction across the flood season, various protective measures and flood prevention arrangements should be made to ensure safe construction. For newly built and old reservoirs that have been completed or whose dams have been filled to the flood control level, a careful inspection should be carried out immediately. Problems should be identified and solved in time to ensure that these projects safely pass the flood season and fully play their role in flood prevention and benefit.

    The high or low flood control standard of a reservoir is the key to the safety of the reservoir. A thorough inspection of the flood control standards of all reservoirs should be carried out before the flood season. Large and medium-sized reservoirs should strive to reach the standard of being able to withstand a flood that occurs once in a century. The standard should be appropriately increased for those with important towns, industrial and mining enterprises, and railway transportation lines downstream of the project. For those with low standards, measures such as reinforcing and raising the dams, adding emergency spillways, and widening and deepening the original spillways must be taken before the flood season according to the actual conditions of the project to reach the safety standard.

    The principle of river flood prevention is to ensure that important dike sections do not collapse or breach. In order to overcome possible particularly large floods, it is necessary to earnestly summarize the flood prevention experience of previous years, conduct in-depth and meticulous organizational work and ideological work, improve the vigilance of the broad masses of cadres and people along the river, and do a good job in annual dike maintenance, rectification, reinforcement, and elimination of hidden dangers.

    Mobilizing the masses, starting early, and making all preparations ideologically, organizationally, and materially is an important experience in winning flood prevention victories over the years. Flood prevention agencies at all levels should fully rely on the people's communes to quickly organize flood prevention and rescue teams. Every reservoir should set up a flood prevention organization and make a flood prevention plan. The reservoir construction site under construction should designate a special person to organize a flood prevention team, establish a reservoir water situation forecast, and establish telecommunications contact with the downstream area to ensure timely command and dispatch and rapid transmission of flood information. Strengthening close ties and mutual support between upstream and downstream, between regions, and between departments, unified dispatch of manpower and material resources, and unified management of water conservancy facilities are indispensable conditions for doing a good job in flood prevention.

    Time is very tight, and floods wait for no one. Party committees at all levels should immediately take action to organize a major inspection before the flood season to check ideas, check the project situation, check the flood prevention organization, check material preparation, check the water situation forecast, check preventive measures for particularly large floods, and so on. Only by thoroughly understanding the flood prevention situation can we ensure that flood prevention preparations are implemented item by item.

    The conditions for this year's flood prevention work are unprecedentedly good. The General Line and the Great Leap Forward are more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, the people's communes are becoming increasingly consolidated and strengthened, and the large number of water conservancy projects built over the years, especially last year and this year, have greatly enhanced the ability to control floods. We believe that as long as we seize the time, fully utilize the favorable conditions, and effectively do the above work, we will be able to overcome any type of flood that may come, we will be able to fully exert the benefits of the project, ensure the great development of industrial and agricultural production, and win a complete victory in this year's flood prevention work!

    及早做好防汛准备工作
    我国南方各省已经进入汛期，北方各省的汛期也将接踵而至。一年一度的防汛斗争开始了。
    今年的防汛斗争，面临着跟往年不同的一些新情况。过去的防汛任务，主要是在江河中下游的堤线上。大跃进以来，特别是去年和今年，各个地区修筑了许多水库，已经建成的大量水库对于拦蓄洪水、灌溉农田、变水害为水利，起了决定性的作用。这个有利条件是过去所没有的。正是因为这样，水库防汛的重要性，就特别显得突出了。有的省区水库大坝的总长度大大超过了过去江河堤防的总长度，而且大多数分散在山区。如何保证已经完工和正在施工的水库的安全，并且最大限度地发挥它们可能发挥的兴利效益，是今年防汛斗争中一个重要的任务。在江河防汛方面，由于大量水库对径流的拦蓄，河道枢纽工程的节节控制，江河下游的水势工情也随着发生了一些变化，许多过去的险工变成平工，某些过去的平工也可能变成险工。我们不能只看到有利条件，而忽视了各种新情况。因此，对于河道防汛工作，仍然应该加以注意。
    防汛是人与自然的艰苦的斗争，这个斗争关系着千百万人民生命财产的安全，关系着国家经济建设发展的速度。虽然十年来，特别是最近几年来，我们的水利建设取得了伟大的成就，大大增强了战胜洪水和取得防汛斗争胜利的物质力量，但仍不能有任何疏忽大意和麻痹思想。应该了解，水利建设是人类对自然的长期的斗争，目前许多地区虽然已能战胜一般的水旱灾害，但对特大的洪水灾害还不能完全控制，而特大洪水每年都有发生的可能。防汛如作战，要“从最坏处打算，向最好处努力”。对于各种类型的洪水都要有对策，有办法，坚决保证不倒坝，不决口。大、中型水库和主要江河的重要堤段，更要确保安全。在确保安全的条件下，继续贯彻“以蓄为主，全面安排，综合利用”的方针，使各项已经完成的水利工程，在防害兴利方面发挥最大作用。
    水库防汛是今年防汛工作的重点，必须在汛前作好安排。对于计划今年拦洪、已经合龙、但大坝尚未填筑到拦洪高程的水库，必须采取一切有效措施，加快工程进度，抢到洪水前面，并且做好洪水提前到来的预防措施，以确保安全；对于今年汛期拦洪没有把握的水库，在当前汛期已经到来的情况下，要一律推迟到汛期以后合龙。对于跨汛期施工的水库，要做好各种防护措施和防汛安排，保证安全施工。对于已经建成，或大坝已经填筑到拦洪高程的新旧水库，要立即进行一次仔细的检查，发现问题，及时解决，保证这些工程安度汛期，并充分发挥防洪兴利的作用。
    水库防洪标准高低是水库安全与否的关键。在汛前要对所有水库的防洪标准进行一次周密的检查。大、中型水库要力争达到能抵御百年一遇洪水的标准。工程下游有重要城镇、工矿企业、铁路交通干线的，标准还应适当提高。凡是标准偏低的，必须根据工程的实际状况，在汛前采取加固加高大坝，添设非常溢洪道，加宽加深原有溢洪道等措施，达到安全标准。
    江河防汛的原则是确保重要堤段不溃不决。为了战胜可能发生的特大洪水，需要认真总结历年的防汛经验，进行深入细致的组织工作和思想工作，提高沿河广大干部、群众的警惕性，作好堤防岁修、整险、加固、消除隐患等工作。
    发动群众，及早动手，从思想上、组织上、物料上做好一切准备，是历年来防汛胜利的一条重要经验。各级防汛机构要充分依靠人民公社，把防汛抢险队伍迅速组织起来。每一个水库都要设立防汛组织，作出防汛计划。正在施工的水库工地要指定专人组织防汛队伍，建立水库水情预报，跟下游地区建立电讯联系，保证指挥调度及时，汛情传递迅速。加强上下游之间、地区与地区之间、部门与部门之间的密切联系和互相支援，统一调度人力、物力，统一管理水利设施，是做好防汛工作不可缺少的条件。
    时机很紧迫，洪水不等人。各级党委应该立即行动起来，组织一次汛前大检查，查思想，查工程情况，查防汛组织，查物料准备，查水情预报，查特大洪水预防措施等等。只有把防汛情况摸清摸透，才能作到防汛准备件件落实。
    今年防汛工作的条件空前良好。总路线、大跃进更加深入人心，人民公社日益巩固壮大，历年来、特别是去年和今年修建的大量水利工程，大大增强了控制洪水的能力。我们相信，只要抓紧时间，充分运用有利条件，切实作好上述工作，一定能够战胜可能到来的任何类型的洪水，一定能够充分发挥工程效益，保证工农业生产的大发展，夺取今年防汛工作的彻底胜利！
