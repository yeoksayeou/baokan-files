Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 4th: Jinan Iron and Steel Plant, a backbone enterprise of Shandong's iron and steel industry, has adopted the method of simultaneous design and construction. At present, it has built two medium-sized blast furnaces, a set of converters, an electric furnace, and a rolling mill. This factory has become a joint enterprise from iron smelting and steelmaking to steel rolling.

　　Jinan Iron and Steel Plant started construction in July 1958. Thanks to the workers' earnest implementation of the Party's General Line, giving play to their high labor enthusiasm, actively carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution movements, and with the strong assistance of relevant units, the construction progress has greatly exceeded the original construction plan. The construction time for the two blast furnaces was 103 days for one and only 96 days for the other. At present, the actual production level of the two blast furnaces has exceeded the designed capacity. In the past year and ten months, most of the factory's capital construction projects have been completed ahead of schedule, and the project quality basically meets national requirements.

　　Due to the early completion and smooth commissioning of many capital construction projects of this factory, it has produced more pig iron, steel, and steel products for the country.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 4th: Guangzhou Iron and Steel Plant, which started construction in Guangzhou in 1957, has rapidly developed into an iron and steel joint enterprise. The successively built iron smelting, coking, steelmaking, and rolling workshops have been put into production one after another. Now, this factory has two small blast furnaces, one coke oven, eight converters, and a rolling mill. In addition, around the development of production, this factory has also built a machine repair workshop, a dolomite workshop, a wharf raw material processing plant, and railway and highway transportation lines inside and outside the factory.

　　Guangzhou Iron and Steel Plant has always been engaged in construction and production simultaneously. Not long after the start of construction, it began to actively support the industrial and agricultural production and construction inside and outside the province with the iron and steel it produced. In the past, the iron for casting in Guangzhou's factories was all transferred from other places, but now it is basically supplied by Guanggang. This spring, rural areas in various parts of Guangdong Province vigorously built water conservancy projects. At that time, there was a shortage of steel. Guanggang immediately played its role and transferred more than 3,000 tons of steel to support the construction of water conservancy in rural areas throughout the province in a short period of time.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 4th: After one year and eight months of construction, Anyang Iron and Steel Company in Henan Province has formed an iron and steel joint enterprise with mining, coking, iron smelting, steelmaking, and steel rolling.

　　At present, this factory has built and put into production more than a dozen medium-sized and small blast furnaces, as well as several small steelmaking converters. In terms of steel rolling, two rolling mills have been built and put into production.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 2nd: The newly built Hongfeng Hydropower Station on the Maotiao River in Guizhou Province officially generated electricity on the morning of May 29. On that morning, representatives of people from all walks of life in the province and city, and the builders of the power station, held a grand celebration meeting. Zhou Lin, First Secretary of the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee and Governor of the province, also came to congratulate.

　　The power generation capacity of Hongfeng Power Station is 20,000 kilowatts. Its completion and power generation not only provides strong power for the Guiyang area, but also creates rich experience for the construction of large-scale hydropower stations in the province.

    发展小洋群提高小洋群为钢铁工业开辟更多的基地
    济南广州安阳建成钢铁联合企业
    贵州新建二万瓩猫跳河水电站正式发电
    新华社济南4日电　山东的钢铁骨干企业——济南钢铁厂，采取边设计、边施工的方法进行建设，目前已经建成了两座中型高炉和一组转炉、一座电炉、一套轧钢机。这个工厂已经变成了一个从炼铁、炼钢到轧材的联合企业。
    济南钢铁厂是在1958年7月动工兴建的。由于建厂职工认真贯彻了党的总路线，发挥了高度的劳动热情，积极开展技术革新和技术革命运动，并在有关单位的大力协助下，建设进度大大超过了原来的建设规划。两座高炉的施工时间，一座用了一百零三天，另一座只用了九十六天。目前两座高炉的实际生产水平，都已超过了设计能力。一年十个月来，这个厂的各项基建工程，绝大部分都提前完工，工程质量基本上都符合国家规定要求。
    由于这个厂的许多基建工程提前建成并顺利投入生产，已为国家生产了更多的生铁、钢和钢材。
    新华社广州4日电　广州市在1957年动工兴建的广州钢铁厂，已经迅速发展成为一个钢铁联合企业。先后建成的炼铁、焦化、炼钢、轧钢等车间，已经相继投入生产。现在，这个厂已拥有两座小高炉、一座焦炉、八座转炉、一套轧钢机。此外，围绕着生产的发展，这个厂还建成了机修车间、白云石车间、码头原料加工场、厂内外铁路和公路交通运输线等。
    广州钢铁厂一直是边基建、边生产的。开工建设不久，就开始以自己生产出来的钢铁积极支援了省内外的工农业生产建设。过去广州市各工厂的铸造用铁都靠外地调拨，现在已基本上由广钢供应了。今年春天，广东省各地农村大力兴修水利，当时缺乏钢材，广钢立即发挥了它的作用，在短短的时间中，调出支援全省农村兴建水利的钢材达三千多吨。
    据新华社郑州4日电　河南省安阳钢铁公司经过一年零八个月的建设，已经形成了一个有采矿、炼焦、炼铁、炼钢、轧材的钢铁联合企业。
    目前，这个工厂已经建成和投入生产的有中、小型高炉十多座，以及好几座炼钢小转炉。在轧钢方面已有两套轧钢机建成投入生产。
    据新华社贵阳2日电　贵州省新建的猫跳河红枫水电站已在5月29日上午正式发电。这天上午，省市各界人民代表和电站建设者们，举行了隆重的庆祝会。中共贵州省委第一书记、省长周林也前来祝贺。
    红枫电站的发电能力为两万瓩。它的竣工发电，不仅为贵阳地区提供了强大的电力，而且为省内建设大型水电站创造了丰富经验。
