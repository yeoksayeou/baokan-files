Determined to Catch Up with Sun Village
Representative of Zhongying People's Commune, Puan County, Guizhou Province, Cai Jinming

	Our commune is a high and cold mountainous area inhabited by more than 32,000 people of the Buyi, Miao, and Han nationalities. Before liberation, under the dark rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the people lived in poverty, with insufficient clothing and wild vegetables as their staple food. The sanitary conditions were extremely poor: garbage piled up like mountains, excrement and urine were everywhere, rats swarmed, mosquitoes and flies buzzed, livestock had no shelters, and humans and animals lived together. As a result, infectious diseases such as malaria, dysentery, typhoid fever, and relapsing fever were prevalent year-round, and about 95% of the people were plagued by illness every year. Therefore, people called this place a place where "even immortals passing by would suffer three bouts of chills." Because the broad masses of people were poor and unable to afford medical treatment, and were also constrained by superstitious ideas, they only knew to burn incense and make vows, praying to gods and worshiping Buddha when they fell ill. Huagong was originally a large village with more than a hundred households, but due to deaths from illness and fleeing famine, only two people remained by the time of liberation. Of the fifty-seven households in Huana, only three remained. Truly, the fields were barren, nine out of ten houses were empty, and the scene was desolate.

	After liberation, under the correct leadership and cordial care of the Party and the government, with the continuous development of agricultural production and the increasing improvement of material and cultural life, our commune launched a mass patriotic health campaign, eliminating infectious diseases such as smallpox, relapsing fever, and typhus that seriously endangered people's health. Under the glorious illumination of the General Line, relying on the favorable organizational form of the People's Commune, a mass upsurge of eliminating pests and diseases was launched, bringing about fundamental changes in the sanitary outlook of the entire commune. Since 1959, in just over a year, the four pests have been basically eliminated, 214 wells have been improved, and 188 new public toilets have been built, each with three pools (i.e., a manure pool, a sealed manure storage pool, and a medicinal pool), and 1,008 private toilets have been improved. In addition, 168 new bathing ponds have been built, basically achieving one pond per village. At the same time, all sewage ditches were dredged and improved, stagnant water ponds were filled in, and excrement, garbage, and waste were treated harmlessly. Humans and animals were separated, and five management areas, eleven production teams, and thirty-two villages built village center gardens. In terms of canteen hygiene, a meal-sharing system was generally implemented. Each canteen has dustproof and flyproof gauze covers, tap water and sand filter tanks. Bowls and chopsticks are steam-sterilized. There is always an adequate supply of tea. Cooks wear masks and work clothes and hats. Commune members have developed good hygiene habits such as brushing their teeth every day, bathing frequently, changing clothes frequently, airing quilts frequently, and washing their hands before meals. With the widespread and in-depth development of the pest elimination and disease prevention movement, the incidence of various diseases has decreased significantly year by year. For example, the incidence of malaria was 1.4% in 1957, 0.11% in 1958, and 0.21% in 1959; the incidence of dysentery was 19.7% in 1957, 1% in 1958, and 0.17% in 1959. No whooping cough cases occurred in 1959, and the occurrence of neonatal tetanus was prevented. The labor attendance rate has remained as high as 95% or more year-round, which has powerfully promoted the development of production. The total value of agricultural and sideline production in the entire commune in 1959 increased by 74.4% on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, achieving a sustained leap forward in production.

	Since the beginning of spring this year, in order to make the movement both vigorous and down-to-earth, the Commune Party Committee has adhered to the working method of combining shock tactics with routine work. In addition to continuing to implement the system of carrying out a major cleaning once per campaign, the masses were also organized to carry out shock repairs on sewage ditches and toilets that needed to be repaired, fill in large and small pits and depressions, properly handle mosquito and fly breeding grounds, improve 349 wells, build 38 new public toilets, and 91 barbershops, accumulating enough sanitary fertilizer for each mu, amounting to 1,400 catties, which strongly supported agricultural production. In particular, after studying the Party Central Committee's instructions on health work, the people of all nationalities in the entire commune became even more invigorated, their enthusiasm redoubled, and their morale was high. The commune held a mobilization rally and organized the masses to carry out continuous shock campaigns. The scale of the campaign, the speed of action, and the effectiveness were unprecedented. From April 7th to 11th, in just five days, the entire commune mobilized more than 25,000 people, eliminating a total of 10,600 rats, accumulating 4,665 tons of sanitary fertilizer, and building 70 new public toilets, thereby achieving public toiletization. In addition, 20 wells were improved, 521 square meters of large and small pits and depressions were filled in, and all 8,200-plus houses in the entire commune were washed and scalded once, and all clothes and quilts were washed and scalded with boiling water. In addition, 1,208 cooks, nursery workers, health workers, and feeders in the entire commune were given hygiene training in batches; health personnel were organized to go deep into the fields and villages to complete a general survey and registration of several major diseases, establish files, and inject typhoid fever vaccine and take decoctions to prevent malaria and dysentery for more than 5,000 commune members. Since the beginning of this year, none of these diseases have occurred, and the attendance rate of commune members has increased from 95% last year to more than 98%, and production efficiency has also been greatly improved, making spring planting work fast and good.

	With the fundamental improvement of the sanitary outlook, the mental outlook of the commune members has also undergone profound changes. The superstitious ideas used by the ruling class in the old society to deceive the working people have been swept away. Now, commune members immediately seek medical treatment when they fall ill, and a fashion of everyone paying attention to hygiene and everyone loving cleanliness has been formed. Commune members think about the past, look at the present, and look forward to the future, and they love the Party and Chairman Mao even more. They sing like this: "The Communist Party is truly good, giving the people 'Lingzhi grass'; eliminating the root of thousands of years of disease, happy life is forever beautiful." "The People's Commune shines brightly, and the commune members are all happy; the commune is a thousand times better in a year, and the four pests and 'plague gods' are swept away."

	The main experiences of Zhongying People's Commune in achieving a double harvest in production and health are:

	Strengthening Party leadership and adhering to putting politics in command

	Under the correct leadership of the Party committees at all levels, the people of all nationalities in Zhongying Commune resolutely implemented the Party Central Committee's instructions on eliminating pests and diseases and the health work policy of "prevention first," adhered to putting politics in command, and launched a mass movement on a large scale, combining the elimination of pests and diseases with various tasks. The Commune Party Committee implemented the leadership method of "unified leadership, comprehensive arrangement, division of labor and cooperation, and responsibility to the end" for various tasks. The commune and management areas have established pest elimination and disease prevention command organizations, with the Party Committee Secretary as the commander. The Party Committee also implemented the "three grasps" and "five unifications" methods. The "three grasps" are: grasping the implementation of policies and guidelines, grasping the ideological leadership of the health department, and grasping the timely promotion of typical experiences. The "five unifications" are: unified leadership, unified deployment, unified action, unified inspection, and unified evaluation. Not only that, but the three secretaries of the Party Committee personally built a toilet. Because of the strengthened leadership, with the Party Committee in command and the secretary taking the lead, the masses were highly motivated in each movement, and the development of the movement surged wave after wave.

	Extensively carrying out health propaganda and fully mobilizing the masses

	In each movement, a large-scale propaganda team was organized to use slogans, blackboards, big-character posters, dramas, clappers, local broadcasts, and especially mountain songs, utilizing mealtimes in the canteen, breaks in the fields, time before and after evening meetings, and ways of chatting to carry out extensive and in-depth propaganda and education work, so that the masses could understand the great significance of eliminating pests and diseases, and popularize health knowledge. This is the guarantee for the sustained upsurge of the movement. In the pest elimination and disease prevention movement, many obstacles were encountered at the beginning. Some people believed that "rats can drill holes; flies and mosquitoes fly all over the sky, and it is difficult to eliminate them"; as well as "blocking rat holes will cause deafness," "eliminating the four pests is harmful to nature," and so on. To address these superstitious and right-leaning ideas, the Commune Party Committee launched a large-scale debate from inside and outside the Party, and organized the masses to visit and conduct on-site education. At the on-site meetings, facts were presented, reasons were explained, and detailed accounts were calculated, which greatly improved the ideological understanding of the masses. In particular, the greatest effect was achieved by organizing the masses to recall and compare the past and present, complain about the suffering of diseases, and dig out the roots of diseases. Therefore, the elimination of pests and diseases became a conscious action of the masses. Old man Deng Xingtian caught more than 700 rats within a few days after the meeting; Long Hongfu, who previously believed that eliminating the four pests was "harmful to nature," also actively participated in the movement after the meeting; Yang Shanzhang, who originally believed that "blocking rat holes would cause deafness," also actively participated in blocking rat holes. Many traditional Chinese medicine practitioners contributed secret and effective recipes for killing rats. Dozens of witches and sorcerers handed over superstitious props and actively participated in production, and some even became active health propagandists. Since 1958, commune members have created more than 80 kinds of tools for eliminating the four pests, totaling 120,000 pieces; and drugs for killing rats and maggots.

	Hygiene for production, production talks about hygiene

	The Commune Party Committee conscientiously implemented the policy of "health serving production," and made specific arrangements for health work according to the different central tasks in each period. For example, in conjunction with summer harvesting and topdressing of crops and spring planting and fertilization, a large-scale cleanup of feces, garbage, sludge, and sewage was carried out, and a large amount of sanitary fertilizer was accumulated. In conjunction with raising pigs on a large scale, sanitation of livestock pens was promoted. In conjunction with running canteens on a large scale, the construction of dietary hygiene and canteen sanitary facilities was given great attention. In agricultural production, in order to make health work serve production, the Commune Party Committee summed up an experience, which is: with serving production as the goal, starting from production, combining with the central work, seizing every opportunity, inserting efforts at every meeting, and firmly grasping the "three grasps" (i.e., grasping holiday shock tactics, large-scale efforts during slack seasons, and keeping up during busy seasons); "five cleans" (i.e., combining fertilizer accumulation to clear weeds around houses, remove sludge from yin and yang ditches, clear garbage, sweep dust from houses, and pick up cattle and horse manure from mountains and roadsides); "three cleans" (i.e., combining cultivation and fertilization to mobilize the masses to wash houses, wash furniture, and wash clothes); and "three turnovers" (i.e., combining spring plowing and sowing to turn over livestock pens, turn over stove soil, and turn over "eternal" residue). This kept health work regularized, ensuring the health of the masses, improving labor production attendance, and ensuring the sustained leap forward in agricultural production.

	Forming a medical and health network and improving the health system

	Strengthening leadership over grassroots health organizations, replenishing professional teams, and continuously improving their political and professional levels is one of the important keys to doing a good job in health work. Zhongying Commune has one commune hospital (with internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, traditional Chinese medicine, and other departments), 11 management area health clinics, production brigades have health rooms and midwifery stations, and small teams have health workers and midwives. The existing 300-plus health workers in the entire commune have been uniformly deployed to form a relatively complete medical and health network throughout the commune. Due to the soundness of the grassroots health organizations, and the active efforts of all health workers, they went deep into the fields and construction sites to carry out mobile medical treatment, establish an epidemic reporting system, timely and comprehensively grasp the epidemic situation, and effectively control the occurrence of various diseases. Since the spring of 1959, health workers have also conducted general surveys of diseases such as measles and whooping cough throughout the commune. A total of 7,132 measles-susceptible children were found, all of whom took one to two doses of medicine-soaked eggs. At the same time, measles patients were isolated and treated in a timely manner, thereby controlling the spread. In the pest elimination and disease prevention movement, this professional team provided timely technical guidance, promoting the in-depth development of the movement.

	In order to regularize health work, health covenants were formulated, and a series of health systems were established and improved. For example, a rotating duty system is implemented, with one duty group responsible for cleaning the environment every day, and a major cleaning is carried out every six days. Each village has someone specifically responsible for checking cleanliness and hygiene, and it is stipulated that each person must take a bath and change clothes at least once a week. Each village has a manure manager, who is specifically responsible for managing public toilets and harmless treatment of manure; some villages also have a professional health fertilizer accumulation team composed of several semi-able-bodied laborers. Each canteen has established a "report illness card" and "menstrual card." In addition, regular red flag evaluation competitions are carried out, with the commune evaluating once a month and the brigade evaluating every half month, thereby consolidating and developing the movement.

	Give full play to the role of traditional Chinese medicine in eliminating pests and diseases

	The Commune Party Committee conscientiously implemented the Party's traditional Chinese medicine policy, incorporating all 58 traditional Chinese medicine practitioners in the commune into health organizations at all levels to work, and properly solved the problem of wages and remuneration; regularly convened meetings to understand their opinions and requirements, and strengthened leadership over them. In order to improve their political awareness and professional level, 11 traditional Chinese medicine practitioners were selected and sent to the county Red and Expert Health School for study in 1959. The other health workers were given education on uniting with traditional Chinese medicine to give full play to the enthusiasm of traditional Chinese medicine and folk medicine. In recent years, they have contributed more than 1,000 secret and effective prescriptions, among which the dysentery decoction is not only significantly effective but also plays a preventive role. For example, in 1959, due to its widespread use, the incidence of dysentery decreased from 1% in 1958 to 0.1%. Folk prescriptions and acupuncture were widely used to prevent and treat diseases throughout the commune, and more than 100 kinds of drugs for killing rats, maggots, and mosquitoes were made with traditional Chinese medicine. The three traditional Chinese medicine practitioners in the commune hospital treated more than 260 patients in half a year, saving the country more than 800 yuan in medical expenses. Among them, Miao traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Yang Zhengfang contributed more than 60 secret prescriptions and boldly innovated, successfully trial-producing 54 kinds of traditional Chinese medicine formulas, curing more than 100 patients. All other health workers in the commune can now not only skillfully use acupuncture to treat diseases but also use 10 to 30 herbal formulas to treat diseases.

	The above is a general overview of the development of health work in our commune. Although we have achieved some results, we are still far from the requirements of the Party. In the future, we must hold high the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune to continuously advance production and health work. We are currently carrying out a movement to transform open ditches into covered ditches, completely eliminate breeding grounds for the four pests, and completely achieve harmless treatment of feces and garbage. We are determined to catch up with Jishan Sun Village.

    决心赶上太阳村
    贵州省普安县中营人民公社代表　蔡金明
    我社是一个高寒山区，境内居住着三万二千多布依族、苗族和汉族人民。解放前，在国民党反动派的黑暗统治下，人民过着衣不蔽体，野菜当粮的日子，卫生状况极为恶劣：垃圾堆成山、屎尿遍地、老鼠成群、蚊蝇扑面、畜无棚舍、人畜共居。因此，疟疾、痢疾、伤寒、回归热等传染病终年流行，每年有95％左右的人被病魔纠缠。因而人们称这里是“神仙过路也要打三个摆子”的地方。广大群众由于生活贫困，无力就医，加之受到迷信思想束缚，得了病只知道烧香许愿，求神拜佛。花贡原来是个百多户的大寨，由于病死、逃荒，到解放时，只剩下两个人；五十七户的花纳也只剩下三户。真是田园荒芜，十室九空，一片凄凉。
    解放后，在党和政府的正确领导和亲切关怀下，随着农业生产不断发展，物质文化生活日益提高，我社开展了群众性的爱国卫生运动，消灭了严重危害人民健康的天花、回归热、斑疹伤寒等传染病。在总路线的光辉照耀下，依靠人民公社的有利组织形式，掀起了群众性的除害灭病运动高潮，使全社的卫生面貌发生了根本的变化。1959年以来，在短短的一年多的时间里，基本消灭了四害，并改良了二百一十四个水井，新建一百八十八个公共厕所，个个都有三池（即粪池、密封贮粪池、药池），并对一千零八个私厕进行了改良。还新建了一百六十八个洗澡塘，基本上实现一寨一塘。同时疏通和改良了所有的污水沟，填平了积水塘，对粪便、垃圾、污物进行无害化处理，人畜分居，并有五个管理区，十一个生产队，三十二个村寨，修起了寨心花园。在食堂卫生方面，普遍推行了分餐制，每个食堂都有防尘、防蝇的纱罩，自来水和沙滤缸，碗筷食具做到蒸汽消毒，随时有充足的茶水供应；炊事人员有口罩和工作衣、帽。社员养成了每天刷牙，勤洗澡，勤换衣，勤晒被，饭前洗手等良好的卫生习惯。随着除害灭病运动广泛深入地开展，各种疾病的发病率逐年显著下降。如疟疾的发病率1957年为1．4％，1958年为0．11％，1959年为0．21％；痢疾发病率1957年为19．7％，1958年为1％，1959年为0．17％。1959年没有发生一个百日咳病人，并杜绝了新生儿破伤风的发生。劳动出勤率常年高达95％以上，从而有力地促进了生产的发展。全社1959年农副业总产值在1958年大跃进的基础上增长了74．4％，获得了生产的持续跃进。
    今年入春以来，为了使运动既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实，公社党委坚持了突击与经常相结合的工作方法，除继续执行每场开展一次大扫除的制度外，还组织了群众对应修整的污水沟、厕所都进行了突击修整，填平了大小坑洼，妥善处理蚊蝇孳生地，还改良了水井三百四十九个，新建公共厕所三十八个，理发室九十一个，积制卫生肥每亩合一千四百斤之多，有力地支援了农业生产。特别是学习了党中央对卫生工作的指示以后，全社各族人民精神更加振奋，干劲倍增，意气风发，斗志昂扬；公社召开了誓师大会，组织群众进行连续突击，其声势之大，行动之速，效果之好为前所未有。从4月7日至11日，仅五天的时间，全社出动了二万五千多人，共消灭老鼠一万零六百只，积卫生肥四千六百六十五吨，新建公共厕所七十个，从而实现了公厕化。还对二十个水井进行了改良，填平大小坑洼五百二十一平方米，全社八千二百多栋房屋全部洗烫一遍，所有衣服被子均用开水洗烫一道。此外还分批的对全公社一千二百零八名炊事员、保育员、保健员和饲养员进行了卫生培训；组织了卫生人员深入田间和村寨，完成了几种主要疾病的普查和登记，建立了档案，对五千多社员注射了伤寒疫苗和服用了预防疟疾、痢疾的药汤。今年以来，这几种疾病都未发生过，社员出勤率从去年的95％上升到98％以上，生产效率也大为提高，使春播工作做得既快又好。
    随着卫生面貌的根本改观，社员的精神面貌也发生了深刻的变化。旧社会统治阶级用来蒙蔽劳动人民的迷信思想，已经一扫而光。现在社员们得了病立即请医生诊治，一个人人讲卫生、个个爱清洁的风尚已经形成。社员们想想过去看看现在，展望将来，他们更加热爱党和毛主席，他们这样歌唱着：“共产党来真正好，给了人民‘灵芝草’；千年的疾病除了根，幸福生活永美好”。“人民公社放光芒，社员个个喜洋洋；公社一年胜千载，四害‘瘟神’一扫光。”
    中营人民公社取得生产、卫生双丰收的主要体会是：
    加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅
    在各级党委正确领导下，中营公社各族人民坚决贯彻执行了党中央关于除害灭病的指示和“预防为主”的卫生工作方针，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，把除害灭病和各项工作拧成了一股绳，公社党委对各项工作实行“统一领导，全面安排，分工协作，负责到底”的领导方法。公社和管理区都成立了除害灭病指挥机构，由党委书记任指挥长。党委又实行了“三抓”“五统一”的办法。“三抓”即：抓政策方针的执行情况，抓卫生部门的思想领导，抓典型经验的及时推广。“五统一”即：统一领导，统一布置，统一行动，统一检查，统一评比。不仅如此，党委的三个书记还亲自动手修建了一个厕所。由于加强了领导，党委挂帅，书记出马，在历次运动中，群众干劲冲天，运动的发展一浪高一浪。
    广泛开展卫生宣传，充分发动群众
    在历次运动中，组织了大规模的宣传队伍，采用标语、黑板报、大字报、戏剧、快板、土广播，特别是山歌等形式，利用食堂吃饭、田间休息、夜晚会前会后的时间和摆家常等方式，进行广泛深透的宣传教育工作，使群众了解除害灭病的伟大意义；普及了卫生知识。这是运动得以持续高涨的保证。在除害灭病运动中，开始也遇到很多障碍。有人认为“老鼠会钻洞；苍蝇、蚊子满天飞，难得消灭”；以及“堵鼠洞会耳聋”，“消灭四害伤天害理”等等。对这些迷信和右倾思想，公社党委一面从党内到党外展开大鸣大放大辩论，一面组织群众参观，进行实地教育。在现场会上用摆事实、讲道理、算细账等方法，大大提高了群众的思想认识，特别是通过组织群众回忆对比、诉疾病的苦、挖病害的根，收效最大。因此，除害灭病形成了群众自觉的行动。邓兴田老汉会后不几天，就捕捉了老鼠七百多只；过去认为除四害是“伤天害理”的龙洪福，会后也积极地投入了运动；原来认为“堵鼠洞会耳聋”的杨善章也积极参加了堵鼠洞。很多中医献出了杀灭鼠的秘方、验方。数十个巫婆、魔公交出迷信道具，积极参加了生产，有的还成为积极的卫生宣传员。从1958年以来社员创造了除四害工具八十余种，计十二万件；和杀鼠杀蛆药物。
    卫生为生产、生产讲卫生
    公社党委认真贯彻了“卫生为生产服务”的方针，根据各个时期不同的中心任务，对卫生工作进行具体布置。如结合夏收作物追肥、春播施肥，大搞粪便、垃圾、污泥、污水清除，大积卫生肥。结合大养其猪，大搞畜圈卫生。结合大办食堂，大抓饮食卫生和食堂卫生设施的建设。在农业生产中，为了使卫生工作为生产服务，公社党委总结出了一条经验，这就是：以服务生产为目的，从生产着眼，结合中心工作，见缝插针，遇会插脚，紧紧抓住了“三抓”（即抓节日突击、农闲大搞、农忙跟上）；“五光”（即结合积肥把住房周围杂草铲光，阴阳沟污泥掏光，垃圾清除光，房屋扬尘扫光，山上、路旁的牛马屎捡光）；“三洗”（即结合中耕施肥，发动群众大洗房屋、洗家具、洗衣服）；“三翻身”（即结合春耕播种，搞牲畜圈翻身、灶土翻身、“万年”渣翻身）。这样使卫生工作保持了经常化，保障了群众的身体健康，提高了劳动生产出勤率，保证了农业生产的持续跃进。
    组成医疗卫生网，健全卫生制度
    加强对基层卫生组织的领导，充实专业队伍，不断地提高其政治、业务水平，是做好卫生工作的重要关键之一。中营公社现有公社医院一所（设有内、外、妇产、中医等科），管理区卫生所十一所，生产大队有保健室、接生站，小队有保健员、接生员。并对全社现有的三百多个卫生人员作了统一调配，在全社范围内组成了一个比较完整的医疗卫生网。由于基层卫生组织的健全，以及全体卫生人员的积极努力；深入田间、工地，开展巡回医疗，建立疫情报告制度，及时全面地掌握了疫情，有效地控制了各种疾病的发生。从1959年春天以来，卫生人员还在全社内进行了麻疹、百日咳等疾病的普查工作。查出麻疹易感儿童七千一百三十二人，均服用了一至二次药泡鸡蛋。与此同时，还及时隔离治疗麻疹病人，从而控制了蔓延。在除害灭病运动中，这支专业队伍及时地进行了技术指导，促进了运动的深入发展。
    为了使卫生工作经常化，订有卫生公约，建立与健全了一系列的卫生制度。如实行轮流值日制度，每天有一个值日组负责打扫环境卫生，六天进行一次大扫除，每个寨子有一个专门负责检查清洁卫生，并规定每人每星期至少洗一次澡、换一次衣。每个村寨设有粪管员，专门管理公共厕所，和粪便无害化处理；有的村寨还有由几个半劳动力参加的卫生积肥专业队伍。每个食堂建立了“报病牌”“月经牌”。此外还开展定期的红旗评比竞赛，公社一月一评，大队半月一评，从而使运动巩固发展。
    充分发挥中医在除害  灭病运动中的作用
    公社党委认真贯彻执行了党的中医政策，将全社五十八位中医，全部吸收到各级卫生机构中工作，并妥善地解决了工资报酬；经常召集开会，了解他们的意见和要求，加强了对他们的领导。为了提高他们的政治觉悟和业务水平，1959年选派十一名中医到县红专卫校学习。对其他卫生人员，进行团结中医的教育，以充分发挥中医和民间医的积极性。几年来，他们献出了一千多个秘验方，其中痢疾汤不但疗效显著，并能起到预防作用，如1959年由于广泛地服用，使痢疾的发病率从1958年的1％下降到0．1％。在公社范围内普遍采用了民间验方和针灸来防治疾病，用中药制成灭鼠、杀蛆、灭蚊等药物一百余种。公社医院三个中医，在半年内就治疗了二百六十多个病人，为国家节约了八百多元的医药费，其中苗族中医杨正芳献出了六十多个秘方，并大胆革新，试制成功中草药方剂五十四种，治好了一百多个病人。全社其他卫生人员现在不但能熟练地用针灸治疗疾病，还能使用十到三十个草药方剂治疗疾病。
    以上是我们公社卫生工作开展的概况。我们虽然取得了一些成绩，但是离党的要求还很远。今后，我们一定要高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，使生产和卫生工作不断跃进。目前正在开展变明沟为暗沟，彻底消除四害孳生地，和彻底实现粪便、垃圾无害化处理的运动。我们决心赶上稷山太阳村。
