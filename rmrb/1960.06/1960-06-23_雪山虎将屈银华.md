    At the "Assault Camp" on Mount Everest, 8,500 meters above sea level, athlete Qu Yinhua was so excited that he couldn't sleep all night after receiving the order from the mountaineering team headquarters to join the assault on the summit. On the morning of May 24, the day of the summit assault, he got up at four o'clock to light the gas stove and boil water for everyone. He thought: if everyone can drink enough water, it will greatly increase their strength for the summit assault. But because the marching pot brought to the assault camp had been blown away by the wind, he had to use the iron tea box to boil water six times in a row, so that all the comrades who were assaulting the summit with him could drink their fill.

    At 9:30 a.m., Qu Yinhua and his comrades Wang Fuzhou, Liu Lianman, and Gonbu set off to assault the summit. More than two hours later, as they spiraled up to the middle of the famous "Second Step" of Mount Everest, Qu Yinhua, who was leading the way, found it difficult to keep his footing on the steep, slippery rocks, even though he was wearing specially made high-mountain boots with steel spikes. He struggled to climb up a few steps, but then slipped back to where he had started.

    At this altitude, known as the "Death Zone," Qu Yinhua thought: "If you don't conquer difficulties, you will be conquered by them. Are we, like the mountaineers of capitalist countries, willing to submit to the power of nature on Mount Everest? No, definitely not. We are mountaineers taught by the Party and Chairman Mao. If we retreat, how can we face the Party when we return?" So, he simply took off his six or seven-pound high-mountain boots, wore only thin cotton socks, took a few breaths of artificial oxygen, perked himself up, and used his toes to grip the cracks in the rocks and climbed upwards. In the severe cold of minus 30 degrees Celsius, Qu Yinhua's feet quickly went from pain to numbness and loss of sensation, and every step upwards required tremendous effort. But he persevered and finally opened the way forward for his comrades.

    When they reached the bottom of the last three-meter vertical rock face at the top of the "Second Step," the task of opening the way was taken over by athlete Liu Lianman. Liu Lianman climbed four times and slid down four times, finally using his own body to lift his comrades one by one to the top, using his own energy to pave the way forward for his comrades. Liu Lianman's noble communist style greatly encouraged Qu Yinhua, and he demanded of himself: "Only victory is allowed, failure is not allowed, resolutely reach the summit!" Finally, he and his comrades Wang Fuzhou and Gonbu reached the summit of the world's highest peak.

    Why does Qu Yinhua possess such heroic and tenacious spirit, perseverance, lofty collectivist spirit, and revolutionary optimism? According to his own and other members of the mountaineering team's answers, it is the gift of a working-class family, the result of the Party's nurturing and education, and the influence of the motherland's magnificent and splendid nature.

    Twenty-five years ago, Qu Yinhua was born into a worker's family in Yunyang County, Sichuan, on the banks of the Yangtze River. His grandfather, father, and older brother were all loggers living in the deep mountains and forests.

    His working-class family gave Qu Yinhua a tenacious character of resisting the exploiting classes from an early age. He often asked his father and brother: "We work all day long, why do we eat bad food and wear rags, while the landlords are idle, and they wear good clothes and eat good food?" One day, he was playing with a group of children when the landlord's daughter fell into a paddy field. The landlord insisted that he had pushed her and beat him up. He thought: I won't just let you beat me for nothing. From then on, he often took revenge.

    After liberation in 1952, all four members of his family became workers in a state-owned logging farm. In 1953, he was transferred to the original forests of Aba to cut timber. The leaders educated him: now logging is not just for making a living, but more importantly for building our great socialist motherland and building our own factories, mines, and cities. He felt that his work had a new meaning. At that time, the eighteen-year-old Qu Yinhua was broad-shouldered and thick-waisted, with a burst of energy. He always exceeded the prescribed daily production target and always volunteered to cut down the large trees on the steep rocky slopes.

    The primeval forest is charming, but also frightening. In summer and autumn, there is thunder and lightning, and the roar of pine waves; in winter and spring, there is ice and snow, and fierce north winds. But on warm and sunny days, it is a scene of lush forests and blooming flowers. The clanging of axes, the roar of falling trees, and the resounding calls weave together into melodious music. The high mountains and primeval forests developed Qu Yinhua's brave and optimistic character, and he completed the logging tasks well every month. In 1954, he was admitted to the Communist Youth League.

    In 1956, he honorably joined the Communist Party of China. The team he led also became an advanced logging team. He himself was also elected as a model worker and attended the model worker meeting of the Sichuan Provincial Forestry Industry Department. At the meeting, he received another profound education. He realized that it was nothing for a Communist Party member to work hard to complete the task, but to work hard and cleverly, and to creatively complete the tasks assigned by the Party. After returning to the forest farm, he mobilized everyone to carry out technical innovations, improve logging methods and tools, and the efficiency was multiplied, and the task was over-fulfilled again and again. At the same time, their forest farm life became more active. The basketball team they organized persisted in training, studied once after each defeat, and finally won the championship of the entire forest farm. On holidays, he also liked to participate in mountaineering and hunting teams, climb steep cliffs, and race with mountain goats and wild rabbits. The Party's education and training made Qu Yinhua a brave, tenacious, collective-loving, and revolutionary-loving proletarian fighter.

    Qu Yinhua's mountaineering life began in September 1958. At that time, as a member of China's mountaineering team, he went to the Soviet Union to climb Lenin Peak, 7,134 meters above sea level, with Soviet athletes. At that time, he was like a newborn calf unafraid of tigers, with a physique known as "three and a half tons," but he did not have mountaineering skills and could not master the characteristics and laws of high-mountain sports. When climbing cliffs and ice slopes, he often slipped and rolled down; when carrying heavy loads, he would be out of breath after a while. However, he never despaired, and tirelessly learned from the Soviet mountaineers, initially mastering how to move on ice and snow, how to climb rock walls, how to protect himself when slipping and falling, and how to make fire and cook in high-mountain oxygen-poor conditions, and how to live in high mountains, etc., and finally reached the summit of Lenin Mountain.

    In July 1959, Qu Yinhua, as a member of the Chinese mixed-gender mountaineering team, climbed Mount Muztagh Ata, 7,546 meters above sea level, in Xinjiang.

    In the battle to climb Mount Everest, under the care and education of the Party, and with the help and encouragement of his comrades, Qu Yinhua showed even more heroic and tenacious perseverance, thus becoming an outstanding mountaineer who won glory for the motherland. During the third march to conquer Mount Everest, Qu Yinhua took on the task of organizing the transportation of supplies. Together with other transportation team members, he faced the strong high-mountain winds, carrying twenty kilograms of supplies on his back, and advanced to a height of 8,000 meters above sea level. On the way, two Tibetan team members suddenly fell. Qu Yinhua immediately added the supplies from his comrades to his own. On his body, the oxygen cylinders had increased from three to five, and there was also a movie camera and his own complete set of mountaineering equipment, weighing more than 40 kilograms in total. Carrying such a heavy load at such an altitude is something that people living on the plains can hardly imagine, but Qu Yinhua firmly took one step after another and successfully completed the transportation task with his comrades.

    Now, on the highest point of our planet, the footprints of Qu Yinhua, a snow mountain tiger general taught by the Party, have been left. At the end of the interview, he said: The great Party and Chairman Mao have given us the spirit of collectivism and the determination and perseverance to overcome difficulties. In the future, on our way forward, even if there are peaks more difficult and dangerous than Mount Everest, we will definitely be able to conquer them. We will definitely be able to plant the five-star red flag all over the high peaks of our motherland!

    雪山虎将屈银华
    新华社记者　赵家烈
    在珠穆朗玛峰拔海八千五百米的“突击营地”，运动健将屈银华接到登山队队部决定让他参加突击顶峰的命令后，兴奋得彻夜不眠。突击顶峰这一天——5月24日清晨四点钟，他便起来点燃煤气炉，给大家烧水。他想：大家能喝足水，对突击顶峰就能增加很大的力气。但因为带到突击营地的行军小锅已经被风吹跑了，他只好用装茶叶的铁盒一连烧了六次水，让一起突击顶峰的战友们都喝得足足的。
    上午九点半，屈银华和突击顶峰的战友王富洲、刘连满和贡布一起出发了。两个多小时以后，当他们盘旋登越到珠穆朗玛峰著名的“第二台阶”中部时，在前面开路的屈银华尽管脚上穿着特制的带有钢钉的高山靴，也很难在陡滑的岩石上踏稳。他费了很大的劲刚刚攀上几步，就又滑落到原来的地方。
    在这被人称为“死亡地带”的高度，屈银华想：“不征服困难，就要被困难征服。难道我们就像资本主义国家的登山家们一样，甘心屈服在珠穆朗玛峰大自然的威力下吗？不，决不，我们是党和毛主席教导出来的登山队员，如果后退，有什么脸回去见党呢？”于是，他干脆脱掉六、七斤重的高山靴，只穿着薄薄的线袜，吸了几口人造氧气，提了提神，就用脚趾踩住岩缝又向上攀登。在摄氏零下三十多度的严寒里，屈银华的脚很快就由疼痛变得麻木而失去知觉，每上升一步都要付出巨大的精力。但他坚持着，终于为战友们打开了前进的道路。
    在来到距离“第二台阶”顶端最后三米的垂直岩面下时，开路任务被运动健将刘连满接过去了。刘连满连攀登四次滑下四次，最后以自己的身体把战友们一个个托上顶端，用自己的精力来为战友们铺平前进的道路。刘连满这种崇高的共产主义风格，使屈银华受到很大鼓舞，他要求自己：“只准胜利，不准失败，坚决登上顶峰！”最后他终于和战友王富洲、贡布登上了世界最高峰的顶峰。
    屈银华为什么能具有这种英勇顽强的气魄，坚韧不拔的毅力，崇高的集体主义精神和革命的乐观性格呢？按他自己和登山队其他队员们的回答，是工人阶级家庭的天赋，是党的培养和教育的结果，是受到了祖国雄伟壮丽的大自然的陶冶。
    二十五年前，屈银华出生在四川长江边云阳县一个工人家庭里。他的祖父、父亲和哥哥，都是在深山老林中生活的伐木工人。
    工人的家庭，使屈银华从小就有一副反抗剥削阶级的顽强性格。他常问父兄：“我们整天干活，为什么吃坏的穿破的，而地主们游手好闲，还穿好的吃好的？”一天，他和一群孩子在一起玩，地主的女儿失落到水田里去了，地主强词夺理说是被他推下去的，揍了他一顿，他心想：白挨你打就算了不成。从此，他就常常进行报复。
    解放后的1952年，他家父兄四人全成为国营伐木场的工人。1953年，他被调到阿坝原始森林里采伐木材。领导上教育他说：现在伐木不是单独为了谋生活，更重要的是建设我们劳动人民的伟大祖国，建设我们自己的工厂、矿山和城市。他感到干活有了新的意义。当时，十八岁的屈银华长得膀阔腰圆，有股子猛劲，规定的日产指标，他总要超额完成，并且老争着去伐险陡岩坡上的大树。
    原始森林是媚人的，也是令人恐惧的。夏秋，雷鸣电闪，松涛呼啸；冬春，冰雪交加，朔风凛烈。而在天暖气晴的日子，却是一幅林木苍翠、百花盛开的景色。锵锵的斧声，树倒的轰鸣，高亢的号子，织成了动听的乐曲。高山峻岭和原始森林把屈银华锻炼出一副勇敢乐观的性格，采伐任务他月月都完成得很好。1954年，他被吸收加入了青年团。
    1956年，他又光荣地加入了中国共产党。他领导的小组，也成为先进的伐木小组。他本人还被选为劳动模范，出席了四川省森林工业厅的劳动模范会议。会上，又给他一次深刻的教育。他认识到，一个共产党员苦干完成了任务算不得什么，要苦干加巧干，创造性地完成党所交给的任务。回到林场后，就发动大家大搞技术革新，改善了伐木操作方法和工具，工效成倍地提高，任务一翻再翻地超额完成。同时，他们的林场生活更活跃了，他们组织的篮球队坚持锻炼，失败一次研究一次，最后终于夺得了全林场的冠军。假日，他也喜欢参加登山打猎队，攀登陡岩峭壁，与山羊野兔赛跑。党的教育培养，使屈银华成为一个勇敢顽强、热爱集体、热爱革命事业的无产阶级战士。
    屈银华的登山生活，是从1958年9月开始的。那时候，他作为我国登山队的一员，到苏联同苏联运动员一起攀登拔海七千一百三十四米的列宁峰。当时，他像初生之犊不怕虎，有一副被人称为“三吨半”的体格，但却没有登山技术，掌握不了高山运动的特点和规律，攀峭壁、登冰坡，常常一失手就古噜噜地滚了下来；负重行军不一会，就弄得气喘不止。可是，他从不灰心，不倦地向苏联登山运动员们学习，初步掌握了怎样在冰雪上行动，怎样攀登岩壁，怎样在滑跌时保护自己，以及如何在高山氧气少的情况下生火、做饭，如何在高山生活等等，最后终于登上了列宁山的顶峰。
    1959年7月，屈银华作为中国男女混合登山队的一员，又在新疆境内登上了拔海七千五百四十六米的慕士塔格峰。
    在攀登珠穆朗玛峰的战斗中，屈银华在党的关怀和教育下，在战友们的帮助和鼓舞下，更加表现出英勇顽强、坚韧不拔的毅力，从而成为一名为祖国争得荣誉的出色的登山运动员。在征服珠穆朗玛峰的第三次行军中，屈银华担任了组织物资运输工作的任务，他同其他运输队员们一起，迎着强烈的高山风，背着二十来公斤的物资，向拔海八千米的高度前进。在途中，突然有两个藏族队员摔倒了，屈银华立即把战友们身上的物资加在自己身上。在他的身上，氧气筒已由三个增加到五个，还有一部电影摄影机和自己的全套登山装备，共重四十多公斤。在这样的高度负重这么多，是生活在平原的人难以想像的事情，可是屈银华却坚强地一步步地向上迈去，同战友们一起胜利地完成了运输任务。
    现在，在我们这个星球的最高点上，已经留下了党教导出来的雪山虎将屈银华的足迹。他在记者访问结束时说：伟大的党和毛主席，给了我们集体主义精神和战胜困难的决心与毅力。今后，在我们前进的道路上，就是有比珠穆朗玛峰更难更险的高峰，我们也一定能征服它。我们一定能把五星红旗插遍祖国所有的高山顶峰！
