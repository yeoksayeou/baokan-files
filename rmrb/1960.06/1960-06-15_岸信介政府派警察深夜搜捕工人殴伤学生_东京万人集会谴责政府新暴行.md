Xinhua News Agency, June 14th, Tokyo Dispatch: Over ten thousand workers, students, intellectuals, and housewives gathered in Tokyo today for a "National Rally to Defend Democracy," strongly opposing the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," opposing Eisenhower's visit to Japan, and condemning the police's brutal suppression of students.

Renowned commentator Kenzo Nakajima emphasized at the rally that the democracy-loving Japanese people will surely win victory because they are the majority.

Nakajima said that Kishi Nobusuke imposed the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" on the Japanese people, relying on the voice of a ghost – which he calls "the silent voice of the people."

Tomitaro Kaneda, Vice Chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), emphasized regarding Eisenhower's visit to Japan that when the government asks the people to warmly welcome him on the grounds that the US president is a guest of the Japanese Emperor, the government is deceiving the Japanese people.

Kaneda Tomitaro said, "We firmly oppose Eisenhower's visit to Japan!"

Masae Shimosaka, representative of the All-Japan Farmers Association, pointed out in his speech that the voters who originally elected the Kishi Nobusuke group are rapidly turning against the Liberal Democratic Party, especially since the Diet incident on May 19th (i.e., the Kishi Nobusuke group forcibly "passed" the new "Security Treaty" in the House of Representatives), farmers have abandoned their conservative views.

Eijun Otani, who withdrew from the Liberal Democratic Party, expressed anger at the policies of the Liberal Democratic Party, saying that he was prepared to sacrifice himself for the cause of peace, as taught by Buddhist doctrine. He condemned the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." He said, "This treaty dooms Japan to be drawn into war."

Professor Tetsuzo Tanikawa of Hosei University and a representative of professors from Tokyo University of Education protested at the meeting against the police's brutality of entering the university this morning to arrest students. They said that university professors from various universities have risen up to strongly protest the police's brutality of infringing upon the principle of university independence and autonomy.

Other speakers included Kazuko Yamaji, representative of the Japan Mothers' Congress Liaison Committee, Buddhist priest Keibun Nishikawa, Shunma Kano, representative of the National Federation of Trade and Industrial Organizations, Shizuko Hirasawa, representative of nursery school teachers opposing the security treaty, Saburo Ishijima, representative of the Christian Peace Association, musician Kyosuke Kami, Professor Isao Kikuchi, former president of Kyushu University, and writer Tomoji Abe.

In their speeches, they all emphasized that the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet should resign immediately and the Diet should be dissolved.

Letters and telegrams from political parties such as the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, as well as from Shigeru Nambara, former president of Tokyo University, and physicist Hideki Yukawa, were read out at the meeting.

After the rally, the participants began a demonstration to march towards the Diet, where they will meet with youths and women holding demonstrations there.

This afternoon, the Socialist Party sent four Diet members, including Ritsuko Tobe, to the Supreme Public Prosecutor's Office, the National Police Agency, and the Metropolitan Police Department to file protests. Representatives of the Socialist Party pointed out: "Last night's search disregarded the existence of university authorities and trampled on the spirit of university autonomy."

Xinhua News Agency, June 14th, Tokyo Dispatch: At the request of its American masters, the Kishi Nobusuke government has begun arresting workers and students who participated in the demonstration on the 10th to protest the visit of US President's Press Secretary Hagerty to Japan.

According to reports, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department suddenly searched the labor union of the Nippon Kokan K.K. Kawasaki Factory on the night of the 13th and arrested five workers.

At the same time, the police of the Kishi Nobusuke government also searched the offices of the student associations of Tokyo University of Education and Hosei University, injuring many students.

    岸信介政府派警察深夜搜捕工人殴伤学生
    东京万人集会谴责政府新暴行
    新华社14日讯　东京消息：日本一万多工人、学生、知识分子和家庭妇女今天在东京举行“保卫民主全国大会”，强烈反对新日美“安全条约”，反对艾森豪威尔访问日本，谴责警察镇压学生的暴行。
    著名评论家中岛健藏在大会上强调说，爱民主的日本人民一定会赢得胜利，因为他们是大多数。
    中岛健藏说，岸信介把新日美“安全条约”强加在日本人民头上，他依靠的是幽灵的声音——他把这称为“人民的无声的声音”。
    日本工会总评议会副议长兼田富太郎谈到艾森豪威尔访问日本时强调说，当政府以美国总统是日本天皇的客人为理由要求人民热烈欢迎他时，政府是在欺骗日本人民。
    兼田富太郎说，“我们坚决反对艾森豪威尔访问日本！”
    全日本农民协会联合会的代表下坂正英在大会讲话中指出，原来选举岸信介集团的选民们正在很快地转过来反对自由民主党，因为特别自从5月19日国会事件（即岸信介集团用暴力在众议院强行“通过”新“安全条约”）以来，农民们放弃了他们的保守的看法。
    退出了自由民主党的大谷莹润对自由民主党的政策表示愤怒，他说，他准备像佛教教义教导的那样，为和平事业牺牲自己。他谴责新日美“安全条约”。他说，“这个条约使日本注定要卷入战争”。
    法政大学教授谷川彻三和东京教育大学教授的代表在会上对今天上午警察进入大学搜捕学生的暴行提出抗议。他们说，各大学的大学教授已经纷纷起来强烈抗议警察侵犯大学独立自主的原则的暴行。
    其他发言的有日本母亲大会联络委员会代表山字和子，佛教法师西川景文、全国商工团体联合会代表狩野俊马、反对安全条约的保育员代表平泽静子、基督教和平协会代表石岛三郎、音乐家纸恭助、前九州大学校长菊池勇夫教授和作家阿部知二。
    他们在发言时都强调指出，岸信介内阁应当立即辞职，国会应当解散。
    会上宣读了共产党、社会党等政党和前东京大学校长南原繁和物理学家汤同秀树的函电。
    在大会后，与会者开始举行示威向国会前进，他们将在国会附近同在那里举行示威的青年和妇女会合。
    社会党今天下午派户叶里子等四位国会议员向最高检察厅、警察厅、警视厅分别提出抗议。社会党代表指出：“昨晚的搜查是无视大学当局的存在，蹂躏了大学的自治精神”。
    据新华社14日讯　东京消息：岸信介政府根据美国主子的要求，竟然开始逮捕10日参加抗议美国总统新闻秘书哈格蒂访问日本的示威的工人和学生。
    据报道，东京警视厅13日夜里突然搜查日本钢管公司川崎工厂的工会，并且逮捕了五名工人。
    与此同时，岸信介政府的警察还搜查了东京教育大学、法政大学学生会的办公室，打伤了许多学生。
