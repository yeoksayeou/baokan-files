Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 13th: In the struggle to resist floods and provide disaster relief, the broad masses of cadres in the Shantou Special Zone of Guangdong Province have fully promoted the Party's fine traditions, taking the lead, enduring hardships, and going deep into the front lines of flood resistance and the most dangerous places to fight alongside the masses.

According to the decision of the CPC Shantou Prefectural Committee, all levels of leading cadres throughout the special zone have recently, without exception, left their offices, gone deep into production, deep into the grassroots, and deep into backward units to eat, live, and labor with the masses. This resolute revolutionary measure has been further implemented in this battle to resist typhoons and floods.

When typhoons and rainstorms struck, leading cadres at all levels in the region personally commanded the battle at the front lines. Luo Tian, First Secretary of the CPC Shantou Prefectural Committee, and Zhang Gengsheng, Secretary-General of the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee, who came to inspect, went deep into the most dangerous areas day and night to direct the rescue. More than 1,000 cadres from the Prefectural Committee and the Commissioner's Office also went to the dikes to participate in the rescue work with the masses. Leading cadres in Chao'an, Chenghai, Shantou and other counties and cities located in the lower reaches of the Han River all personally went to the front lines of flood prevention and rescue to prevent floods and rescue with the masses. All secretaries and members of the CPC Chenghai County Committee were responsible for all dangerous sections, fighting day and night with the masses. After Liu Bin, Secretary of the CPC Chao'an County Committee, received the news that the dam of the Fenghuang Hydropower Station in the county was in danger, he immediately led cadres and the radio station, climbed mountains and crossed rivers for dozens of miles at 2:00 a.m. to rush to the scene to direct the rescue.

Under the leadership of the Prefectural Committee and the County Committee, the broad masses of grassroots cadres in communes and brigades also ate and lived with the masses day and night, struggling hard in the wind and rain, forgetting to eat and sleep. In the battle to resist floods and protect the Han River Dam in Chao'an County, the first secretaries of the Party committees of various communes along the river and more than 60% of the members of the Party committees took the lead in going to the dikes to participate in the rescue. Cai Mingsong, Secretary of the Fuyang Commune Party Committee, crawled back and forth to transport stones in the strong wind, and he also dived more than 20 times in a row, and finally led the workers to rescue the dangerous section. Xiao Yanhua, Secretary of the Party Branch of Guanbi Brigade of Nipi Commune in Xingning County, went to the embankment with illness and fought day and night, and finally blocked two loopholes in the Guanbi section of the Ningjiang River embankment with the commune members. Chen Ruiqing, Secretary of the Oushang Brigade General Branch of Xia Peng Commune in the suburbs of Shantou City, who led the commune members to guard the river embankment, took the lead in diving into the water to block the loopholes whenever a loophole was found on the embankment. In this disaster relief, Hongcao Commune in Haifeng County commended and praised 236 cadres who took the lead in leading the masses in arduous struggles.

The broad masses of people praised the hard-working and in-depth work style of cadres at all levels, and said: "Only under the leadership of the Communist Party can there be such good cadres." Under the leadership of the cadres, the broad masses of people are in high spirits and determined to overcome the disaster.

At 8:00 p.m. today, the water level of the Xiangzi Bridge on the Han River has dropped to 13.33 meters, which is 0.17 meters lower than the local warning water level of 13.5 meters. After repelling the unprecedented extraordinary flood, the masses in various places are now launching labor competitions to further raise and strengthen the dikes and actively restore production.

    抗洪抢险  干部在前
    汕头专区广大干部发扬党的优良传统受到群众赞扬
    新华社广州13日电　广东省汕头专区广大干部在抗洪抢险斗争中，充分发扬了党的优良传统，身先士卒，吃苦在前，深入到抗洪的最前线和最危险的地方，和群众一起共同战斗。
    根据中共汕头地委的决定，全专区各级领导干部最近都毫无例外地走出办公室，深入生产、深入基层，深入到后进单位，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动。这种坚决的革命措施，在这次抗御台风、抗御洪水的战斗中，得到了进一步的贯彻执行。
    当台风暴雨袭来的时候，全区各级领导干部亲临前线指挥战斗。中共汕头地委第一书记罗天和前来视察的中共广东省委秘书长张根生一起，日夜深入到最危险的地区指挥抢险。地委和专署机关的一千多名干部也上堤和群众一起抢险。地处韩江下游的潮安、澄海、汕头等县市的领导干部全部亲临防洪抢险的最前线和群众一道防洪抢险。中共澄海县委的所有书记和委员包干负责所有险段，日夜和群众一起奋战。中共潮安县委书记刘斌接到县内凤凰水电站堤坝告急的消息后，立即带领干部和电台，在深夜二时爬山涉水一口气走了几十里，赶到现场指挥抢救。
    在地委、县委的带动下，公社和大队的广大基层干部也日夜和群众一起同吃同住，一同顶风冒雨，废寝忘餐的艰苦奋战。潮安县在抗洪抢险、保卫韩江大堤的战斗中，沿江各公社党委第一书记和60％以上的党委委员都带头上堤抢险，浮洋公社党委书记蔡名松在狂风下爬着来回运石头，他还一连潜水二十多次，终于带领民工抢救了险段。兴宁县坭陂公社官陂大队党总支书记萧炎华带病上堤日夜奋战，终于和社员一起堵塞了宁江河官陂堤段的二个漏洞。率领社员坚守河堤的汕头市郊下蓬公社鸥上大队总支书记陈锐清，每当堤上一发现漏洞的时候，他就带头潜到水里去堵塞。海丰县红草公社在这次抗灾中，就评比和表扬了二百三十六个身先士卒带领群众艰苦奋战的干部。
    广大群众对各级干部的这种艰苦深入的工作作风，都赞不绝口，他们说：“只有在共产党的领导下才有这样好的干部。”广大群众在干部的带动下，斗志昂扬，决心战胜灾害。
    到今天下午八时，韩江湘子桥的水位已经下降到十三点三三米，比当地警戒水位十三点五米低零点一七米。各地群众在击退空前未有的特大洪水后，现在展开劳动竞赛，进一步加高加固堤围，并积极恢复生产。
