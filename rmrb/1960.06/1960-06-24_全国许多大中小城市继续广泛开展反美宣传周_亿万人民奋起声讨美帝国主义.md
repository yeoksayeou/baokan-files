The people pointed out that as long as the people of the world unite and form the broadest united front, and isolate American imperialism to the greatest extent, they can stop American imperialist aggression and defend world peace.

In Guangzhou, literary and art workers have taken up literary and artistic weapons to denounce American imperialist aggression and provocation. Throughout the city's streets and alleys, anti-American imperialist songs and slogans resound, forming a massive propaganda performance activity against American imperialist aggression, resolutely liberating Taiwan, and defending world peace. On the evening of the 21st, twelve professional art troupes in the city, including Cantonese opera, drama, song and dance, Beijing opera, folk art, puppet shows, and music, jointly held a grand opening ceremony for the "Anti-American Imperialist Aggression, Resolutely Liberate Taiwan, Defend World Peace" art performance week at the Southern Theater; writers and artists worked day and night on creations.

This is a meritorious cannon. In the famous Battle of Shangganling, the Seventh Squad of the Eighth Company of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army used this 75mm field gun to support the infantry, defeating the enemy's many charges and regaining the ground positions once occupied by the enemy, annihilating more than 1,400 enemies, earning a collective special merit, and winning the title of Second-Class Hero Squad.
