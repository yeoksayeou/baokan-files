Xinhua News Agency report: Henan Province is not only engaged in intense wheat harvesting but is also universally carrying out mass-based variety identification, seed selection, and seed retention work, preparing ample superior seeds for an even greater wheat harvest next year. Amidst the busy wheat harvest, the seed selection army and the harvesting and transportation army are working side by side. Superior wheat varieties selected through plant selection, ear selection, grain selection, and block selection are harvested, threshed, and stockpiled separately, creating mountains of grain. Xin County in Xinyang Prefecture, where wheat matures early, has not only selected and retained over 2.7 million jin of superior seeds but has also supported fraternal counties with 400,000 jin of superior seeds.

Henan Province has always valued superior seed selection work. Many communes and teams have established superior seed breeding farms and seed experimental fields, implementing regionalized variety cultivation. This year, over 80% of the summer-harvested wheat in the province consists of superior varieties such as "Nanda 2419," "Huixian Red," "Zhongnong 28," and "Baiyupi." Luoyang Prefecture convened a meeting of county heads, agricultural bureau chiefs, and farmer breeders in Yanshi County to promote Yanshi County’s experience of “one variety per field, one variety per storage,” ensuring that all superior seeds are retained and that seed fields are given priority during harvesting. In Neixiang County, the four levels of Party organization secretaries (county, commune, management area, and brigade) led over 10,000 cadres, technicians, soil experts, and experienced farmers to participate in the evaluation. They used the commune as a unit and the three-level superior seed breeding farm as a base, going deep into the fields to evaluate each block, identify each block, register each block on cards, and mark each block with a sign, having already evaluated 3,600 wheat seed retention fields, totaling over 110,000 mu. Xiangcheng County stipulated "five selections and eight non-selections" during seed selection, namely: select large ears, select uniform ears, select ears with consistent maturity, select ears with large and plump grains, select ears with strong disaster resistance; do not select wheat from field edges, ditch banks, well pits, manure piles, with weak stalks, lodging, diseased plants, or small ears.

Xinhua News Agency report: Zhejiang Province has launched a seed selection and retention campaign during the summer harvest to prepare superior seeds for next year's spring-sown crops. By the end of May, the province had selected and retained over 64.4 million jin of superior barley and wheat seeds, including 8.48 million jin selected by ear.

This year, all localities particularly emphasize selecting and retaining early-maturing, high-yielding, and disease-resistant spring-sown superior seeds. All localities are seriously conducting ear selection, plant selection, or plot selection for superior wheat varieties such as early wheat, Nanda 2419, and Dwarf Grainy Many, superior barley varieties such as Lixia Yellow, Two-Row Rice Wheat, and Dongyang March Yellow, and superior rapeseed varieties such as 325, 322, and Jinhua Red Seed, and are implementing separate harvesting, separate threshing, separate drying, and separate storage.

Zhejiang Province has a large area of spring-sown crops this year, with a tight timeframe and heavy harvesting tasks. Therefore, many areas have properly arranged labor to ensure the completion of the spring-sown seed selection task. Qingtian County has organized a total of 1,687 specialized seed selection teams with nearly 10,000 commune members participating. The county has already selected and retained over 2.11 million jin of superior barley and wheat seeds. The wheat seeds selected and retained by the seed selection team of the Wenxi Commune Seed Breeding Farm in this county have a purity of 99%. Many communes in Ningbo and Jiaxing Prefectures have also organized specialized seed selection teams, implementing separate harvesting, separate threshing, separate drying, and separate storage. On the basis of field seed selection, all localities have also arranged labor for field selection to make up for the shortcomings of field seed selection and ensure that spring-sown superior seeds are selected well and retained in sufficient quantities.

    河南浙江选留夏收作物良种
    据新华社讯　河南省各地在紧张抢收小麦的同时，普遍开展群众性的品种鉴定和选种、留种工作，为明年小麦更大丰收，准备充足的良种。在繁忙的麦收里，各地的选种大军和收割、运输大军并肩作战。经过株选、穗选、粒选、块选的优良小麦品种都单收单打，堆积如山。信阳专区小麦成熟早的新县不但自选自留了二百七十多万斤良种，还支援兄弟县良种四十万斤。
    河南省各地历年来都重视选育良种工作，许多社、队建立了良种繁殖场，种子试验田，实行品种种植区域化。今年全省夏收的小麦中，80％以上是“南大二四一九”、“辉县红”、“中农二十八”和“白玉皮”等优良品种。洛阳专区在偃师县召开了全区县长、农业局长、农民育种家会议，推广偃师县一种一场、一种一仓，良种全部留，种子田优先收打的经验。内乡县的县、社、管理区、大队四级党组织书记，带领干部、技术员、土专家和老农等一万多人参加评选。他们以社为单位，以三级良种繁育场为基地，深入田间，逐块评选，逐块鉴定，逐块登记入卡片，逐块地头插标，已评选出小麦留种田三千六百块，十一万多亩。襄城县在选种中规定“五选八不选”，即：选大穗、选整齐穗、选成熟期一致的穗、选籽大粒肥的穗、选抗灾力强的穗；不选地头、地边、井坑、粪堆、基秆低弱、倒伏、病株、穗小的麦子。
    据新华社讯　浙江省各地在夏收期间掀起了选种、留种运动，为明年春花作物丰收准备好良种。到5月底全省已选留大麦、小麦良种六千四百多万斤，其中穗选的有八百四十八万斤。
    今年各地特别重视选留早熟、高产、抗病力强的春花良种。各地对小麦良种早小麦、南大二四一九、矮粒多，大麦良种立夏黄、二棱米麦、东阳三月黄，油菜良种三二五、三二二、金华红子等，都认真进行穗选、株选、或片选，并实行单收、单打、单晒、单藏。
    浙江今年春花作物面积大、时间紧、收获任务繁重。因此，许多地区都妥善地安排了劳动力，保证春花选种任务完成。青田县全县共组织选种专业队一千六百八十七个，参加专业队的社员近一万人，全县已选留大麦、小麦良种二百一十一万多斤。这个县温溪公社良种繁育场选种专业队选留的麦种纯度达到99％。宁波、嘉兴等专区许多公社也都组织了选种专业队，实行单收、单打、单晒、单藏。在田间选种的基础上，各地还安排劳力进行场选，以弥补田间选种不足，保证选好留足春花良种。
