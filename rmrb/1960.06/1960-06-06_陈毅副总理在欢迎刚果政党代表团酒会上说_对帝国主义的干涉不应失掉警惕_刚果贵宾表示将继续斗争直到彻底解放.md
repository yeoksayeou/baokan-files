Xinhua News Agency, June 5th: At a reception this afternoon to welcome the Congolese political party delegation, Vice Premier Chen Yi, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, warmly wished the Congo success in achieving independence on June 30th.

He said: The victory of the Congo is the result of the long-term struggle of the Congolese people. The Congolese people have forced imperialism to bow its head, to concede, and to retreat. This experience of struggle is true in the Congo, and it is also true in China.

Hu Yuzhi, Vice President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, held a reception this afternoon to warmly welcome all the distinguished guests of the Congolese political party delegation to China. In his speech at the reception, Vice Premier Chen Yi also introduced the experience of the Chinese revolution to the guests, pointing out that after the Chinese people defeated Japanese imperialism in the eight-year War of Resistance, they then defeated American imperialism, which aided Chiang Kai-shek, and established the People's Republic of China. Finally, when American imperialism launched the Korean War, the Chinese people sent volunteers to fight alongside the Korean people and defeat the American aggressors. Only in this way have we achieved today's brilliant construction achievements.

Vice Premier Chen Yi emphasized that the Chinese people today have not lost their vigilance against imperialist interference and threats, nor should they lose their vigilance. The Congolese people, who have achieved independence, will surely understand this valuable experience of the Chinese people. In the struggle against imperialism and colonialism, we will surely find a common meeting point. China and the Congo unite!

This afternoon, Guo Moruo, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Li Siguang, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, and others attended the reception.

Hu Yuzhi spoke at the beginning of the reception to welcome the guests. He said that China and the Congo have a common historical experience and destiny, and imperialism is our common enemy. On the road of the Congolese people striving for complete independence and freedom, 650 million Chinese people will always stand by the Congolese people. The Chinese and Congolese people have fought, are fighting, and will fight together against imperialist aggression and oppression.

Hu Yuzhi said: The victory of the Congolese people once again powerfully proves that imperialism is nothing but a paper tiger. As long as the broad masses of the people unite and resolutely fight against it, they will surely achieve final victory.

Hu Yuzhi pointed out that the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world, American imperialism, is even more using all kinds of insidious means to invade Africa, trying to put new colonial shackles on the people of the Congo and Africa. But we firmly believe that in the face of the heroic Congolese and African people who are determined to control their own destiny, any of their conspiracies are doomed to failure. All patriotic political parties and anti-imperialist forces in the Congo will surely strengthen their unity, continue their efforts, fight imperialism to the end, achieve greater victories, and realize complete and thorough independence.

Three guests spoke at the reception one after another, expressing the Congolese people's friendship with the Chinese people. They were: Alphonse Makwambala, Chairman of the Political Bureau of the People's Party, Arthur Mayamba, Chairman of the Bayanzi Alliance, and Henri Kasongo, head of the third group of members of the Congolese political party delegation to China, who arrived yesterday.

Alphonse Makwambala said that the colonialists have spread the flames of hatred among the Congolese people and are plotting the most shameful conspiracies. Despite their provocations and bribery, the failure of colonialist policies is undoubtedly certain. Because the crimes of colonialism can only make the will of the Congolese people more firm, they will continue the struggle until complete liberation. Colonialists will not be able to stop this powerful trend no matter what methods they use.

He said that the Congolese people urgently need some material assistance, which will guarantee that we give the colonialist demons a fatal blow. He finally shouted: Down with colonialism! Long live the eternal friendship between China and Africa!

Arthur Mayamba said that we have been treated with frank, sincere, and warm hospitality everywhere in China. The facts have once again proved to us that only socialism can make mankind happy and can establish mankind's great, truly color-blind family.

He said, how much we cherish the words "brother." Brothers understand and help each other. Let us understand each other and help each other as much as possible. Tomorrow the Congo will gain independence. Tomorrow our brotherly friendship will be even more consolidated.

Henri Kasongo said that the Congo and China are far apart, but we are all fighting against imperialism, defending world peace, and fighting for the happy life of the people. This struggle has linked us together.

He said that we have come to China to see China's amazing achievements and understand the methods of achieving these achievements, so that we can bring them back and enable independent Congo to achieve achievements that could not be achieved under imperialist rule. He also conveyed the Congolese people's admiration, respect, and sympathy for the Chinese people.

Also attending today's reception were Cai Tingkai, Shi Liang, Li Dequan, Gao Chongmin, Chu Tunan, Nan Hanchen, Wu Han, Zhang Youyu, Mei Lanfang and other well-known figures from various democratic parties, people's organizations and all walks of life, totaling more than 200 people.

    陈毅副总理在欢迎刚果政党代表团酒会上说
    对帝国主义的干涉不应失掉警惕
    刚果贵宾表示将继续斗争直到彻底解放
    新华社5日讯　陈毅副总理今天下午在欢迎刚果政党代表团的酒会上讲话时，代表中国政府和人民热烈预祝刚果在6月30日取得独立。
    他说：刚果的胜利是刚果人民进行长期斗争的结果，刚果人民迫使帝国主义不得不低头、不得不让步、不得不退却。这个斗争的经验在刚果如此，在中国也是如此。
    中国人民外交学会副会长胡愈之在今天下午举行酒会，热烈欢迎刚果政党访华代表团的全体贵宾。陈毅副总理在酒会上的讲话中还向贵宾们介绍了中国革命的经验，指出中国人民经过八年抗战打败了日本帝国主义以后，接着又打败援助蒋介石的美国帝国主义，建立了中华人民共和国，最后当美帝国主义发动侵朝战争的时候，中国人民又派出志愿军同朝鲜人民一道打败了美国侵略军。这样才取得了今天的辉煌的建设局面。
    陈毅副总理强调指出，中国人民在今天，对帝国主义的干涉和威胁，没有失掉警惕，也不应该失掉警惕。取得独立的刚果人民，一定能够理解中国人民这一宝贵经验，在反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争中，我们一定会找到共同汇合点，中国和刚果联合起来！
    今天下午，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长郭沫若，政协全国委员会副主席李四光，中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志等都出席了酒会。
    胡愈之在酒会开始的时候讲话欢迎贵宾。他说，中国和刚果具有共同的历史遭遇和命运，帝国主义是我们的共同敌人。在刚果人民争取彻底独立和自由的道路上，六亿五千万中国人民将永远站在刚果人民一边，中国和刚果人民过去、现在和将来，都要为反对帝国主义侵略压迫而共同奋斗。
    胡愈之说：刚果人民的胜利，再一次有力地证明了帝国主义不过是纸老虎。只要广大人民团结起来坚决与之斗争，就一定能够取得最后的胜利。
    胡愈之指出，全世界人民最凶恶的敌人，美帝国主义更在施展一切阴险手段侵入非洲，力图把新的殖民主义枷锁套在刚果和非洲人民身上。但是我们深信，在决心掌握自己命运的英勇的刚果人民和非洲人民面前，他们的任何阴谋都注定要失败。刚果一切爱国的政党和人民反帝力量一定能够加强团结，再接再厉，和帝国主义斗争到底，取得更大的胜利，实现完全和彻底的独立。
    有三位贵宾在酒会上先后讲话表达刚果人民对中国人民的友情。他们是：人民党政治局主席阿方斯·马克万巴拉、巴阳齐联盟总主席阿图尔·玛扬巴和昨天到达的刚果政党访华团第三批成员的负责人亨利·卡松戈。
    阿方斯·马克万巴拉说，殖民主义者向刚果人民散布了仇恨的怒火，策划着最可耻的阴谋。尽管它们进行挑衅和收买活动，殖民主义政策的失败是确定无疑的。因为殖民主义的罪行只能使刚果人民的意志更加坚定，他们将继续斗争直到彻底解放为止。殖民主义者不论用什么方法都不能阻止这强有力的潮流。
    他说，刚果人民十分需要得到某些物质上的帮助，这能保证我们给殖民主义魔鬼以致命的打击。他最后高呼：打倒殖民主义！中国、非洲永恒的友谊万岁！
    阿图尔·玛扬巴说，我们在中国到处受到人们坦率的、真诚的、热情的接待，事实又一次向我们证明了，只有社会主义能够使人类幸福，能够建立人类伟大、真正的不分人种肤色的大家庭。
    他说，我们是多么珍视兄弟这两个字。兄弟之间是彼此了解和相互帮助的。让我们彼此了解，并尽可能地相互帮助。明天刚果将获得独立了。明天我们兄弟般的友谊将更巩固。
    亨利·卡松戈说，刚果和中国相距遥远，但是我们都为反对帝国主义、保卫世界和平和人民幸福生活而斗争，这个斗争把我们联系在一起了。
    他说，我们到中国来是为了看看中国的惊人成就和了解取得这些成就的方法，以便带回去，使独立的刚果取得在帝国主义统治下所不能取得的成就。他还转达了刚果人民对中国人民的钦佩、敬意和同情。
    参加今天酒会的，还有蔡廷锴、史良、李德全、高崇民、楚图南、南汉宸、吴晗、张友渔、梅兰芳等各民主党派、人民团体和各界著名人士，共二百多人。
