Xinhua News Agency, Havana, June 11th: Cuban Prime Minister Castro pointed out in a television address last night that the several anti-Cuban notes recently presented to Cuba by the US government are for other countries to see, and their purpose is to prepare conditions for implementing US imperialism's aggression plan against Cuba.

Castro listed facts to condemn the US for carrying out anti-Cuban military provocations and espionage activities. He exposed the activities of US warships and military aircraft constantly intruding into Cuban territorial waters and airspace, saying that a US submarine once sailed at night very close to the Cuban coast, and the Cuban Revolutionary Navy fired at the submarine to prevent aggression.

Castro once again pointed out that the United States is preparing to sacrifice the Dominican Republic's dictator Trujillo through the Organization of American States, intending to use this precedent to intervene in Cuba.

Castro also revealed a new conspiracy manufactured by the US State Department to interfere in Cuba, which was uncovered by the Cuban Armed Forces Intelligence Service: Chester, the Nicaraguan running dog of the US State Department, is fabricating a so-called "military expedition" from Cuba to Latin American countries, the purpose of which is to provide "evidence" to "accuse" the Cuban government of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, so that the United States can launch a collective intervention against Cuba.

Castro said that the Cuban authorities have arrested Leslie Bradley, an American agent who came to Cuba to carry out this conspiracy, and seized from him documents for recruiting armed personnel, transceivers, and maps used by the US Navy.

Castro presented on the spot many incriminating evidences that had been seized concerning Chester: two photos of this American agent walking out of the US State Department and his meeting with US Assistant Secretary of State Rubottom; a telegram informing him that Herter had agreed to meet him; a letter from this American agent describing his meeting with Rubottom and Herter at the State Department.

Xinhua News Agency, June 11th: TASS, Moscow, June 10th: Jiménez, head of the Cuban economic delegation visiting the Soviet Union and director of the Cuban National Institute of Agrarian Reform, said in an article published in the Moscow newspaper "Lenin's Banner" on the 10th that the Cuban revolution is aimed at imperialism. Every attack by Cuba on imperialism will be met with a counterattack. "The day is not far off when other Latin American countries will raise our banner."

Referring to the US government's recent statement that it would not give Cuba economic "aid" several months later, Jiménez emphasized: "If the Americans don't bother themselves for so long, the Cubans will be very grateful. There are many other countries that are always ready to help revolutionary Cuba."

    古巴革命针对帝国主义
    卡斯特罗谴责美国反古巴的军事挑衅和间谍活动
    希门尼斯指出人民非常感谢美国停止经济“援助”
  据新华社哈瓦那11日电　古巴总理卡斯特罗在昨晚发表的电视演说中指出，美国政府最近向古巴提出的几项反古巴的照会是为了给其它国家看的，其目的在于为执行美帝国主义对古巴的侵略计划准备条件。
    卡斯特罗列举事实，谴责美国正在进行反古巴的军事挑衅和间谍活动。他揭露美国军舰和军用飞机不断窜扰古巴领海、领空的活动说，一艘美国潜水艇曾经在夜间在距离古巴海岸很近的地方航行，古巴革命海军为了防止侵略，向这艘潜水艇进行了射击。
    卡斯特罗再一次指出，美国正在准备通过美洲国家组织来牺牲多米尼加共和国的独裁者特鲁希略，打算随后援用这个先例来干涉古巴。
    卡斯特罗还揭露古巴武装部队情报处破获的一个美国国务院制造的干涉古巴的新阴谋：美国国务院的尼加拉瓜走狗切斯特正在制造一个所谓从古巴出发的对拉丁美洲国家的“军事远征”，其目的是为“控告”古巴政府干涉他国内政提供“证据”，以便美国发动对古巴的集体干涉。
    卡斯特罗说，古巴当局已经逮捕到古巴来进行这个阴谋活动的美国特务莱斯利·布莱德雷，并且从他那里缴获了招募武装人员的文件、收发报机和美国海军使用的地图。
    卡斯特罗当场拿出已经缴获的关于切斯特的许多罪证：这个美国特务正从美国国务院走出来以及他同美国助理国务卿鲁博特姆进行会谈的两幅照片；一份通知他关于赫脱答应接见他的电报；一封这个美国特务讲述他在国务院同鲁博特姆和赫脱会谈的信件。
    据新华社11日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科10日讯：正在苏联访问的古巴经济代表团团长、古巴土地改革全国委员会主任希门尼斯，10日在莫斯科“列宁旗帜报”上发表文章说，古巴革命是针对帝国主义进行的。古巴对帝国主义的每次进攻都将给以回击。“拉丁美洲其他国家举起我们的旗帜的日子已经不远了”。
    希门尼斯在谈到不久前美国政府曾声明几个月以后不给古巴以经济“援助”时强调指出：“如果美国人不再花这么长的时间来打扰自己的话，那么古巴人会是非常感谢的。有许多其他永远准备帮助革命的古巴的国家”。
