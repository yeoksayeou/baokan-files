Utilizing Every Inch of Cloth

    Skilled Tailors Show Their Talents
    The Taiyuan Municipal Commercial Bureau recently invited ten tailoring workers from various clothing factories to perform their skills. During the performances, they not only displayed their individual talents like the Eight Immortals crossing the sea, but they also jointly assessed and improved the cutting methods for four types of work clothes. Originally, each set of work clothes required an average of more than fourteen feet of cloth; now, it only requires twelve feet three inches, saving one foot seven inches per set, exceeding the national advanced level of twelve feet six inches for work clothes. Thus, based on Taiyuan City's annual production of 350,000 sets of various sizes of work clothes, 664,300 feet of cotton cloth can be saved.
    Through this cutting skill assessment, the cutting techniques and design methods were further improved, achieving uniformity in materials, marking, patterns, and specifications, and changing the inconsistent phenomenon in Taiyuan City's work clothes tailoring.

    巧裁缝各显神通
    太原市商业局管理处，最近请了十个服装厂的剪裁工人，进行技术表演。在表演中，不仅八仙过海，各显其能，他们还共同鉴定和改进了四种工作服的裁剪方法。原来每套工作服平均用布十四尺多，现在只用十二尺三寸，一套节约一尺七寸多布，超过了全国工作服用布十二尺六寸的先进水平。这样，按太原市全年生产各号工作服三十五万套计算，可节约棉布六十六万四千三百尺。
    通过这次裁剪技术鉴定，进一步提高了裁剪技巧和设计方法，做到了用料、划线、样板、规格四统一，改变了太原市裁剪工作服不统一的现象。
