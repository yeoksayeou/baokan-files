Xinhua News Agency, June 24th: The All-China Women's Federation, in a telegram sent on the 23rd to the Japanese Women's Organizations Federation and forwarded to the "National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty," pointed out that the forced resignation of Nobusuke Kishi, the faithful lackey of U.S. imperialism, is a victory for the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic and just struggle.

    The telegram was sent for the Japanese people's national funeral for Kamba Michiko. The telegram first expressed deep condolences to the Japanese people and women and extended sincere sympathy to the martyr's family.

    The telegram said that Ms. Kamba Michiko sacrificed her precious life for the just cause of the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle. The martyr's blood will not be shed in vain. After thwarting Eisenhower's plot to "visit" Japan, the Japanese people and women, under the unprecedentedly high tide of the Japanese people's anti-American and anti-Kishi patriotic struggle and the strong pressure of world public opinion, finally forced the faithful lackey of U.S. imperialism, Nobusuke Kishi, to step down. This is a victory for the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic and just struggle.

    The telegram pointed out that Nobusuke Kishi, the lackey of U.S. imperialism, before stepping down, shamelessly exchanged instruments of ratification for the U.S.-Japan treaty with the United States, disregarding the Japanese people's firm opposition. This despicable act will surely arouse even greater anger among the Japanese people and women. We believe that the Japanese people and women, tempered in the raging struggle, will continue to strive forward, advance valiantly on the blood of martyrs, and fight to the end to completely crush the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty until the final victory is achieved.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 23rd: Indonesian people's organizations continue to support the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic and just struggle.

    The Indonesian Women's Movement Association, the largest women's organization in Indonesia, expressed condolences in a telegram on the 22nd for the female student Kamba Michiko, who sacrificed herself while participating in a demonstration against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and expressed sympathy and support for the anti-American patriotic struggle waged by Japanese women and people to safeguard peace and security in Asia and the world.

    The Indonesian Youth and Student Federation issued a statement expressing support for the patriotic actions of Japanese students. It called on all schools in Indonesia to become fortresses supporting the struggle of Japanese students.

    The Indonesian University Student Movement Alliance recently also sent telegrams to Japanese student organizations, supporting the Japanese students' struggle for a bright future for the Japanese people. In a telegram to the University of Tokyo, the University Student Movement Alliance expressed condolences for the students who sacrificed themselves in the demonstrations.

    The Surabaya Dock Workers Union recently held a rally to support the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military treaty.

    The "Youth Daily" published an editorial today saying that the Japanese people should be allowed to handle their own affairs without any foreign interference so that the Japanese people can organize their new government according to their own wishes; the Japanese people should decide whether American troops should continue to be allowed to remain in Japan, whether American U-2 aircraft should be allowed to operate in Japan, and whether they want the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

    全国妇联致电哀悼桦美智子
    日本人民将踏着烈士鲜血前进
    印度尼西亚人民团体支持日本人民反美爱国斗争
    新华社24日讯　全国妇女联合会在23日发给日本妇女团体联合会并转“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”的电报中指出，美帝国主义的忠实走狗岸信介的被迫下台，是日本人民反美爱国正义斗争的胜利。
    这封电报是为日本人民举行桦美智子国民葬仪而发出的。电报首先向日本人民和妇女表示沉痛的哀悼，并向烈士的家属致以亲切的慰问。
    电报说，桦美智子女士为日本人民反美爱国斗争的正义事业献出了宝贵的生命。烈士的鲜血是不会白流的，日本人民和妇女在挫败艾森豪威尔“访问”日本的阴谋计划之后，接着又在日本人民空前高涨的反美反岸爱国斗争和世界舆论的强大压力下，美帝国主义的忠实走狗岸信介终于被迫下台了，这是日本人民反美爱国正义斗争的胜利。
    电报指出，美帝国主义的走狗岸信介在下台前，竟厚颜无耻不顾日本人民的坚决反对，与美国互换了日美条约批准书，这种卑鄙的行为必将更加激起日本人民和妇女无比的愤怒。我们相信，在如火如荼的斗争中，经受过锻炼的日本人民和妇女必将再接再厉，踏着烈士的鲜血奋勇前进，为彻底粉碎日美军事同盟条约斗争到底，直到取得最后的胜利。
    据新华社雅加达23日电　印度尼西亚人民团体继续支持日本人民反美爱国正义斗争。
    印度尼西亚最大的妇女团体印度尼西亚妇女运动协会22日在一份电报中，对于因参加反对日美“安全条约”示威而牺牲的女学生桦美智子表示哀悼，并且表示同情和支持日本妇女和人民为维护亚洲和全世界的和平与安全而进行的反美爱国斗争。
    印度尼西亚青年学生联合会发表声明，表示支持日本学生的爱国行动。它号召印度尼西亚各学校成为声援日本学生斗争的堡垒。
    印度尼西亚大学生运动联盟最近也打电报给日本学生组织，支持日本学生争取日本人民光明的未来的斗争。大学生运动联盟在致东京大学的电报中，对示威游行中牺牲的学生表示哀悼。
    泗水码头工人工会最近举行集会，支持日本人民反对日美军事条约的斗争。
    “青年报”今天发表社论说，应当让日本人民在没有任何外国干涉的情况下处理自己的事务，以便使日本人民可以根据自己的意愿组织自己的新政府；应当让日本人民来决定：是否应当继续容许美国军队留在日本、是否应当容许美国的U—2型飞机在日本进行活动、他们要不要日美“安全条约”。
