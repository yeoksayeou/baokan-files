Xinhua News Agency, 19th: Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Jiu San Society, stated at the rally of various democratic parties and non-party democratic figures against American imperialist aggression on the 18th that the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world, the head of imperialism, and the number one war element, Eisenhower, arrived today in Taiwan, our territory occupied by American imperialism, to further arrange for aggressive war. This is a grave provocation to the 650 million Chinese people who have stood up, and also a grave threat to the peace-loving people of Asia and the world. We, the members of the Jiu San Society, express our utmost anger and serious protest against this criminal activity of American imperialism, which is resolutely hostile to the people of our country. I fully support the "Letter to Compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu" issued by the Fujian Front Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on June 17th. The artillery fire from the Fujian Front represents the just and angry voice of the 650 million Chinese people.

He said that after Eisenhower undermined the Four-Power Summit Conference, his facade of false peace and genuine war preparations was completely exposed, and he was in an even more isolated position. However, disregarding the opposition of the people of Asia and the world, he hardened his heart and came to the Far East for a "visit" filled with the smell of gunpowder. The people of the world know that this executioner, whose hands are stained with the blood of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, is making this bandit trip entirely to prepare and arrange for new wars of aggression. This fully proves that the nature of American imperialism's war and aggression will never change. American imperialism is indeed the most ferocious common enemy of the Chinese people, the Asian people, and the people of the world. There can be no peace without smashing the aggressive schemes of American imperialism and overthrowing American imperialism. Only modern revisionism will serve American imperialism, spreading the poison of bourgeois pacifism and paralyzing the fighting spirit of the people of the world. However, in the face of serious facts, the fallacies of modern revisionism have gone bankrupt.

Xu Deheng said that Taiwan is our sacred territory. American imperialism's occupation of our territory Taiwan is originally a part of its policy of aggression and war. Its plot to create "two Chinas" and to create so-called "Taiwanese Taiwan" are all attempts to permanently occupy our sacred territory as a base for launching new wars of aggression in Asia. The entire Chinese people, including the Taiwan compatriots, will never tolerate American imperialism's long-term occupation of Taiwan. Taiwan must be liberated, and no force can stop the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan. Eisenhower's criminal activities in Taiwan have further strengthened our determination and fighting spirit to liberate Taiwan and oppose American imperialism. Our just struggle is bound to be victorious.

Xu Deheng finally said that Eisenhower's announcement of this war-preparing trip has aroused unanimous opposition from the people of Asian countries. We Chinese people will never allow its aggressive and war-scheming plots to succeed. The Chinese people, the Japanese people, the Korean people, and all the people of Asia must give the American imperialists a good lesson. Our just struggle against American imperialism is common and consistent, and we support each other. We must unite firmly and fight to the end with American imperialism, our sworn enemy! American imperialism must get out of Taiwan! Get out of South Korea! Get out of Japan! Get out of the Philippines! Get out of all of Asia!

    九三学社主席许德珩讲话
    没有任何力量可以阻挡中国人民解放台湾
    新华社19日讯　九三学社主席许德珩18日在各民主党派和无党派民主人士反对美帝侵略的抗议集会上说，全世界人民最凶恶的敌人、帝国主义的头子、头号战争贩子艾森豪威尔，今天到达美帝国主义侵占下的我国领土台湾，进一步布置侵略战争，这是对站起来了的六亿五千万中国人民的严重挑衅，也是对亚洲和全世界爱好和平人民的严重威胁，我们九三学社社员，对于美帝国主义这种坚决与我国人民为敌的罪恶活动，表示无比的愤怒和严重的抗议。我完全拥护中国人民解放军福建前线司令部6月17日发表的告台、澎、金、马军民同胞书，福建前线炮声，代表六亿五千万中国人民正义的、愤怒的声音。
    他说，艾森豪威尔破坏四国首脑会议之后，假和平、真备战的面目完全暴露，他陷于更加孤立的境地。但是，他不顾亚洲和全世界人民的反对，硬着头皮来远东进行充满火药气味的“访问”。全世界人民都知道，这个双手沾满了亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民鲜血的刽子手，这一次的强盗旅行完全是为了准备和布置新的侵略战争。完全证明美帝国主义的战争和侵略的本质是决不会改变的，美帝国主义确是中国人民、亚洲人民和全世界人民最凶恶的共同敌人，不粉碎美帝国主义的侵略阴谋，不打倒美帝国主义，就决没有和平可言。只有现代修正主义才会为美帝国主义效劳，散布资产阶级和平主义的毒素，麻痹世界人民的斗志。但是，在严重的事实面前，现代修正主义的谬论已经破产。
    许德珩说，台湾是我们中国的神圣领土。美帝国主义占领我国的领土台湾，本来就是它的侵略政策战争政策的一部分，它想搞“两个中国”的阴谋以及制造所谓“台湾人的台湾”，都是企图永久霸占我国神圣的领土，作为在亚洲发动新的侵略战争的一个基地。包括台湾同胞在内的全中国人民，决不能容忍美帝国主义长期霸占台湾，台湾一定是要解放的，没有任何力量可以阻挡中国人民解放台湾。艾森豪威尔到台湾进行罪恶活动，更加加强了我们解放台湾、反对美帝国主义的决心和斗志，我们这个正义的斗争是必然要胜利的。
    许德珩最后说，在艾森豪威尔宣布这次准备战争的旅行时，就激起了亚洲各国人民一致的反对。我们中国人民决不让它的侵略和战争阴谋得逞，中国人民、日本人民、朝鲜人民，以及全亚洲人民，一定要对美帝国主义者好好教训一番。我们反对美帝国主义的正义斗争是共同一致的，是互相支援的，我们必须坚强地团结起来，同我们势不两立的美帝国主义斗争到底！美帝国主义必须从台湾滚出去！从南朝鲜滚出去！从日本滚出去！从菲律宾滚出去！从全亚洲滚出去！
