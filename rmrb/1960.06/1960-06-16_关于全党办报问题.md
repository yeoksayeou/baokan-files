Editor's Note: The People's Daily and Xinhua News Agency recently held a meeting of domestic branch chiefs in Hefei. Comrade Zeng Xisheng, First Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, gave a speech at the meeting on the issue of the whole party running newspapers. Comrade Zeng Xisheng revised this speech into an article and published it in the sixth issue of Anhui's theoretical journal "Xu Yu Shi" (虚与实, Emptiness and Reality). Before reprinting this article, Comrade Zeng Xisheng made some further revisions to it.

The whole party running newspapers, in a broad sense, means the whole party running news undertakings, including newspapers, periodicals, news agencies, and radio stations. The whole party running newspapers is our Party and Comrade Mao Zedong's consistent guiding ideology in news work, and it is also a concrete application of the Party's mass line in news work.

In his speech at the meeting of editors of the Jin-Sui Daily in 1948, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "Running a newspaper is like doing anything else; it must be done seriously to be done well and to be full of vitality. Our newspapers must also be run by everyone, by the masses of the people, and by the whole Party, and not just by a few people behind closed doors." Indeed, news undertakings, like all other undertakings of our Party, must rely on the whole Party and the masses of the people.

Newspaper work, due to its own characteristics, needs even more to rely on the whole Party and the masses of the people. The characteristics of newspaper work are its wide scope, rich content, strong ideological nature, and timeliness. It not only needs to publicize and implement the Party's general line and various policies, but also involves the Party's specific work, the thoughts and actions of the whole Party and the entire people, and all areas of production and life. Everything the Party committee wants to grasp, everything the masses are concerned about, except for state secrets, must be reflected and publicized by the newspaper in a timely manner. The enormous role of newspapers is just as Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in his letter to Comrades Liu Jianxun and Wei Guoqing in 1958: "A provincial newspaper has a tremendous organizational, inspiring, motivating, critical, and promoting effect on the work of the entire province and the entire people." It is very clear that a newspaper cannot fulfill such a major mission by relying on just a few people. Only under the direct leadership of the Party committee, relying on the strength of the whole Party and the masses of the people, can it truly become the ears, eyes, and mouthpiece of the Party and the masses, a powerful tool for guiding and promoting work, and an important link connecting the Party with millions of the masses.

Our newspapers have always followed the teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong and worked according to the principle of the whole party running newspapers, but the degree of implementation has varied. The facts over the years have proved that wherever the principle of the whole party running newspapers is well implemented, the newspapers are full of vitality; wherever the principle of the whole party running newspapers is not well implemented, the newspapers are lifeless. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the whole party running newspapers has entered a new stage. Party organizations at all levels have greatly strengthened their leadership over newspapers, the relationship between newspapers and Party organizations, as well as the vast number of Party members and the masses, has been greatly strengthened, the appearance of newspapers has generally undergone significant changes, and the quality of newspapers has generally greatly improved. This is the result of further implementing the principle of the whole party running newspapers and further implementing Comrade Mao Zedong's thinking on running newspapers.

Several Relationship Issues That Must Be Resolved to Implement the Principle of the Whole Party Running Newspapers

The principle of the whole party running newspapers has been put forward for a long time, and its necessity and correctness are known to everyone. However, how to implement it well in practice is an issue that needs to be constantly studied. Based on our explorations in recent years, we have realized that to truly achieve the whole party running newspapers, we must solve the following relationship issues well.

	The Relationship Between the Party Committee and the Newspaper

	First, the relationship between the Party committee and the newspaper. This is an issue of organizational leadership in newspaper work, and it is the most fundamental issue in implementing the whole party running newspapers.

The newspaper is the Party's newspaper and the Party's tool for propaganda and mobilization. Therefore, the Party committee and the newspaper have a relationship of leadership and being led, which is understood by everyone, and the Central Committee has long had a decision on this. The question is, what kind of leadership and being led relationship should they have?

	On this issue, there used to be two different situations in Anhui Province: one was a general and broad leadership relationship, and the other was a close and interconnected leadership relationship. The main manifestation of the first relationship was: on the Party committee's side, it simply entrusted the propaganda department to manage the newspaper. It is correct and necessary for the propaganda department to manage the newspaper, but the Party committee directly grasped it less. The success or failure of the newspaper was the responsibility of the comrades in the newspaper office. The Party committee only asked them to attend some meetings on issues related to principles and policies and reviewed some important manuscripts. On the newspaper office's side, it did not rely on the Party committee well, only attended some meetings as usual, and did not understand the Party committee's intentions well, so it could not proactively and creatively act according to the Party committee's intentions. In the second relationship, the situation was very different: the Party committee personally grasped the newspaper work, and the various departments of the Party committee also grasped the propaganda and reporting related to themselves, unified planning for what must be publicized and reported, made regular arrangements, and regularly checked and urged, truly regarding the newspaper as a powerful tool for realizing their leadership tasks and regarding running the newspaper well as their own responsibility. The newspaper office also consciously regarded itself as a component of the Party committee, proactively raised issues in its work, and acted according to the Party committee's intentions in everything.

	Regarding the relationship between the reporters of higher-level Party newspapers and news agencies and lower-level Party committees, there were also two different situations: one was the relationship between "host" and "guest," and the other was the relationship of being integrated as one. The so-called "host-guest" relationship meant that the Party committee treated the reporters with courtesy as guests, did not proactively and actively help solve their difficulties, did not criticize their shortcomings, and in reality, let them grow on their own; the reporters believed that they were sent by the higher levels, did not proactively understand the intentions of the local Party committee, and did not actively rely on the local Party committee to carry out their work, forming a single-handed, lone-wolf style; and some individual reporters with poor awareness looked down on leading cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds and did not respect their opinions, resulting in detachment from reality and detachment from the masses. Because the relationship between the reporters of higher-level Party newspapers and news agencies and lower-level Party committees was a relationship between vertical lines and local areas, it was easy to form a "host-guest" relationship if one was not careful. The relationship of being integrated as one meant that the Party committee regarded the reporters sent by the higher levels as members of the local organizational structure and as their own strong assistants; the reporters also proactively relied on the Party committee to carry out their work, consulted the Party committee on matters, and acted according to the guidance of the Party committee. In this situation, the reporters were able to obtain support and better complete their tasks. Lenin said in the "Notice on the Publication of 'Worker's Newspaper'": "We must rely on the help of local organizations and various worker groups, because only their active assistance to the newspaper, only their support, their reflections, their articles, manuscripts, reports, and opinions, can make the 'Worker's Newspaper' stand on its feet and guarantee its publication." Although Lenin's words were said a long time ago, they are still the principles we must follow to run newspapers well today. In 1958, the People's Daily and Xinhua News Agency delegated their branches (reporter stations) to the provincial Party committees, and the branches were directly under the leadership of the provincial Party committees, and the branches became a component of the provincial Party committees. The provincial Party committees not only led the work of the branches politically but also professionally; the branches completely obeyed the leadership of the provincial Party committees and proactively, actively, and creatively did a good job of sending articles to the People's Daily and Xinhua News Agency according to the instructions of the provincial Party committees. This is a new development in the relationship between the reporters of the central newspapers and news agencies and the provincial Party committees, and the facts of the past two years have proven that this is very correct.

	The responsibility of the Party committee is to prevent and change the former abnormal relationship and establish and improve the latter normal relationship. To this end, Party committees at all levels must earnestly improve and strengthen their leadership over news work, and, as Comrade Mao Zedong instructed, grasp it four times a year, once a quarter, and usually ask more about newspaper work. News cadres must consciously strengthen their organizational discipline and resolutely rely on the Party's strength to carry out news business work, completely combining their activities with the Party's ideology and the Party's work. Only by establishing and improving such a relationship can the newspaper truly become a powerful tool of the Party.

	The Relationship Between Party Members and the Newspaper

	Second, the relationship between Party members and the newspaper. Party members participating in running the newspaper and the vast number of readers participating in running the newspaper are one of the main signs of the whole party running newspapers. Correctly resolving the relationship between Party members and the newspaper and the relationship between the vast number of readers and the newspaper is an important guarantee for running the newspaper well.

	Comrade Mao Zedong said in the "'China Worker' Inaugural Speech": "Once a newspaper is started, it must be treated as a matter to be done, and it must be done well. This is not only the responsibility of the people who run it, but also the responsibility of the people who read it. It is very important for the people who read it to put forward opinions, write short messages and articles to send in, and express what they like and dislike. Only in this way can the newspaper be run well." Here, the relationship between the newspaper reader, that is, the reader, and the Party newspaper is very clearly stated. Even the general readers of the Party newspaper should do so, and Party member readers should especially care about and support the Party newspaper. The newspaper is an important part of the Party's cause, and Party members are the Party's cells. Therefore, the newspaper should care about the Party's life and activities, improve the ideological and theoretical level of Party members, and help Party members solve difficulties in their work; Party members should actively work for the newspaper, actively write articles, give opinions to the newspaper, organize the masses to read the newspaper, and expand the newspaper's influence among the masses.

	In the relationship between Party members and the newspaper, the fundamental issue is the attitude of Party members towards the newspaper, because only when Party members actively help the newspaper, participate in newspaper work, and run the newspaper vividly and colorfully can the newspaper suit the needs of Party members themselves. On the issue of Party members' attitude towards the newspaper, there are two different situations: one is to only read and not help, or only read the news and not seriously study the important articles in the newspaper, and some individuals even do not pay attention to reading the newspaper at all. The other is to both read and study, both study and help, submit manuscripts, report situations, and help with distribution. The former has not fulfilled the obligations that Party members should have, and the latter is the attitude that Party members should have towards the newspaper.

	The responsibility of the Party committee is to regularly educate and urge Party members to establish a correct relationship with the newspaper. All Party members must understand that every Party member has a responsibility for whether the Party newspaper is run well or not, and every Party member should contribute their own strength to the Party's organ newspaper. Lenin once said: "It is hoped that all those who regard this organ newspaper as their own organ newspaper, all those who recognize the obligations of a Social Democrat (note: later the Communist Party) member, will forever abandon the bourgeois ideas and habits of action that are usually taken towards legal newspapers: their business is to write, and our business is to read. All Social Democrats should work for the Social Democratic newspaper." Here, Lenin clearly pointed out to us the correct attitude that Party members should take towards the Party newspaper.

	Therefore, the responsibility of readers, especially Party members, to the newspaper can be summarized as reading, writing, using, and helping. Reading means reading the newspaper seriously, learning current affairs, learning policies, learning experience, and learning cultural and scientific knowledge from the newspaper to improve their own political, theoretical, and business level. Writing means actively writing articles, reflecting the work of their own region and department, summarizing experience in their work, and expressing opinions on various theoretical and practical work issues. Not only should they write themselves, but they should also organize others to write. Using means regularly using the newspaper to guide work, conduct propaganda and education, raise the consciousness of the masses, inspire the enthusiasm of the masses, and promote various successful experiences. Helping means helping the newspaper improve its work, regularly providing information to the newspaper, reflecting the opinions of the masses, making criticisms and suggestions, and assisting in the distribution of the newspaper. Only when everyone earnestly assumes such responsibilities can it be guaranteed that the newspaper is run well and that its propaganda and organizational role is fully发挥.

	The Relationship Between Professional and Non-Professional Personnel

	Third, the relationship between professional and non-professional personnel in news work. This is the issue of cultivating and strengthening the Party's writing force.

	Professional and non-professional personnel in news work each have their own characteristics. The former have richer business knowledge and a certain writing level, and are a very valuable force, but they specialize in running newspapers and news agencies, cannot participate in practical work, and are fewer in number; the latter are numerous and widespread, are direct participants in practical struggle, have the most specific and reliable materials, and can reflect the actual situation in work and the demands of the masses from various different angles, but their writing level is generally worse, although some of them have a higher writing level. This is another important writing force. These two forces must be well combined to fully发挥 their role in the whole party running newspapers.

	Between professional and non-professional personnel, there are two different relationships: one is that they do their own thing and do not interact with each other, or professional personnel look down on non-professional personnel; the other is that everyone learns from each other's strengths, helps each other, and jointly completes the writing task. Only by working according to the latter relationship can the newspaper be run well and can everyone improve rapidly. Lenin once said: "Prevent a very common and extremely harmful misunderstanding. This misunderstanding is that it seems that only writers and only writers (in the professional sense) can successfully participate in the work of the organ newspaper; on the contrary, if five leading, regularly writing writers are added to five hundred or five thousand non-writer staff, the organ newspaper will be lively and energetic." Comrade Mao Zedong spoke more clearly on the relationship between experts and non-experts. He said: Specialists should "on the one hand help them (referring to non-experts - translator), guide them, and on the other hand learn from them, absorb the nutrients from the masses, enrich themselves, enrich themselves, and make their specialty not become an ivory tower that is detached from the masses, detached from reality, without content, and without vitality." Although this passage is said to literary workers, it is also completely applicable to news workers. Therefore, professional news workers must bear more responsibility, strengthen their connection with non-professional personnel, help them improve their business level, and obtain their help for themselves.

	The responsibility of the Party committee is to prevent and overcome the former abnormal relationship and establish and strengthen the latter normal relationship. If we use an analogy, it is to help them establish a relationship like the main force (reporters of the central newspapers), local forces (reporters of the local newspapers), and militia (correspondents) of the army. The main force and local forces are the backbone and mobile forces of the army, and the militia are the strong assistants and reserve forces of the main force and local forces. The militia should assist the main force and local forces in combat and learn technology from them; the main force and local forces should guide the militia in combat and help them improve. On the news front, only by combining the reporters of the central newspapers, the reporters of the local newspapers, and the correspondents well and fighting together can we enhance the strength of running newspapers, cultivate more authors, make the newspaper closely linked with the masses, guarantee that the newspaper is rich and colorful, and make the newspaper more popular and suitable for the tastes of the masses.

	The Collaborative Relationship Between News Agencies and Between News Agencies and Other Departments

	Fourth, the collaborative relationship between news agencies and between news agencies and other departments. This is the issue of the use of force, an important issue of how to complete the writing task more, faster, better, and more economically.

	Now there are many things to write, but the writing force is very lacking. How to strengthen collaboration, improve writing efficiency, and fully发挥 the writing force of news agencies and other departments is an important issue that needs to be seriously resolved.

	On this issue, there are also two different situations: one is that some news agencies like to divide their forces and do their own thing, and do not organize and use the writing force of other departments well; some news cadres like to work alone, do not interact with each other, and only believe in themselves and do not believe in others. The other is unified arrangement, division of labor and responsibility, mutual support, and mutual collaboration. The former relationship inevitably leads to less, slower, worse, and more expensive results due to the dispersal of forces, poor collection of materials, and limited personal levels, resulting in omissions, delays, low quality, and duplication. The latter situation shows that due to the proper use of force, writing can be carried out in a planned manner, so that everyone has an appropriate division of labor and can cooperate closely, and everyone can concentrate on completing the topic assigned to them with the help of the collective, so that the writing task can be completed in a timely manner and the writing quality can be continuously improved.

	The responsibility of the Party committee is to continue to criticize and overcome departmentalism and championshipism in news agencies and news cadres, help them change the style of working alone and detached from the masses, and educate them to establish an overall concept and carry forward the spirit of collaboration. The propaganda departments of Party committees at all levels should earnestly grasp the organizational work of collaboration, regularly make plans for what should be written, unify arrangements, and organize the forces of all aspects to ensure completion. Various news agencies should cooperate closely, use their forces rationally, and carry out division of labor and cooperation according to work needs; various departments of the Party and government should actively organize forces to write articles for newspapers and news agencies according to their own business work. In this way, we can fully发挥 the role of existing personnel and write more and better works with less manpower.

	The Relationship Between Investigation and Research and Writing and Processing

	Fifth, the relationship between investigation and research and writing and processing. This is the basic method of writing and the key to improving the quality of work.

	An important task of news work is to reflect reality and guide reality. To achieve this requirement, we must not only collect rich practical materials, but also seriously analyze and improve them; we must not only see the problem, but also express it well and write articles with a higher ideological content.

	On this issue, there are also two different practices: one is to separate investigation and research from writing and processing. Some article writers do not do investigation and research work, or are too busy with writing tasks to squeeze out time for investigation and research. The articles written in this way are bound to be full of empty talk and not based on reality; some people who engage in investigation and research do not use the materials collected to write articles, or do not analyze and improve the materials when writing articles, resulting in a list of phenomena and vague viewpoints. The other is to combine the two, both engaging in investigation and research and engaging in writing and processing. The articles written in this way have both rich materials and correct and clear viewpoints. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "Occupy materials in detail and draw correct conclusions from these materials under the guidance of the general principles of Marxism-Leninism." This is the working method of dialectical materialism and the fundamental principle of writing. It is not easy to write a good article. The most fundamental problem is to conduct serious investigation and research and analyze and improve the materials obtained from investigation and research. Writing articles is like factory processing. It is impossible without raw materials. However, professional writing cadres generally do not do practical work, and they do not produce "raw materials" themselves. The raw materials are created by the masses, and they only play the role of "processing." Therefore, professional writing cadres must first collect materials and occupy materials, otherwise it is processing without raw materials, and it is impossible to "add" useful products in this way. Of course, it is not enough to just occupy materials, but also to be good at analysis and improvement, and also to pay attention to logic and rhetoric, otherwise it is still impossible to make what is written accurate, clear, and vivid.

	The responsibility of the Party committee is to strengthen the education of linking theory with practice among cadres, so that those who lack practice and those who lack theory can each attack their own weaknesses, thereby effectively changing the former incorrect practice and constantly promoting the latter correct practice, and combining investigation and research with writing and processing well. Because only in this way can we improve the quality of writing and improve the ideological and guiding nature of newspapers.

	The Relationship Between Points and Surface, Central Work and General Work

	Sixth, the relationship between points and surface, central work and general work in news reporting. This is the issue of layout in reporting, an important issue of how to comprehensively reflect the Party's cause, and also the issue of how news workers strengthen their connection with various aspects.

	Breaking through a point and driving the whole situation, grasping the central work and promoting the general work, this is Comrade Mao Zedong's consistent working method, and our newspapers must reflect this spirit. However, we must also take care of the whole situation when grasping the key points, and we must also take care of the general work when grasping the central work. This is also Comrade Mao Zedong's consistent working method, and newspapers must also reflect this spirit. Only in this way can we avoid losing sight of the other, reflect the full picture of the Great Leap Forward that is both high-speed and proportional, better encourage the enthusiasm of various regions and departments, and also more universally and widely attract cadres and the masses from various regions and aspects to care about newspapers, use newspapers, and help newspapers.

	On this issue, there are also two situations: one is that the points are grasped, but the surface is lost; the central work is grasped, but the general work is lost; or the key points are not discovered and grasped by relying on the Party committee, but are framed by their own subjective ideas. The other is that both the key points are grasped and the overall situation is taken care of, both actively cultivating the original key points and discovering new key points from objective conditions, and both grasping the central work and taking into account the general work.

	Since the Great Leap Forward, the issue of reporting on central work and general work has been basically resolved, but some people are still not clear about the issue of reporting on points and surface. They have not deeply understood that under the unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, the general principles and principles of various regions are the same, but because the development of various regions is different and the progress of work is different, the work steps and practices are often different. If only individual key points are grasped for reporting, it is impossible to represent the whole, and therefore it is impossible to promote the whole; if only attention is paid to the key points that they cultivate or the key points that they often grasp, and the new things that emerge in the mass movement are not discovered, then the initiative of the masses will inevitably be buried. Moreover, the so-called key areas are also relative. Today they are in the front, tomorrow they may be in the back. This matter is in the front, and another matter may be in the back. Therefore, grasping key points must proceed from reality in order to accurately reflect the key points and better promote the whole.

	The responsibility of the Party committee is to educate news cadres to always pay attention to the actual situation below, help them make overall arrangements in their work, not only grasp the key points in a planned manner, but also grasp the key points flexibly, and not only grasp the central work well, but also take care of the general work, and combine the points and surface and the central work and general work well, in order to adapt to the new situation of overall leap forward.

	The above six issues, in summary, are how to run newspapers well under the unified leadership of the Party committee, linking with reality, linking with the masses, organizing and using the forces of all aspects, and improving working methods. Only by correctly resolving these relationships can the principle of the whole party running newspapers be truly reflected, and can newspapers be run better.

	Some Experiences in Implementing the Principle of the Whole Party Running Newspapers

	To solve the above-mentioned relationship issues well and truly achieve the whole party running newspapers, we must work from two aspects: on the one hand, strengthen ideological education, and on the other hand, strengthen organizational leadership and improve working methods.

	Judging from the situation in Anhui, some relationships in newspaper work were not completely resolved before the Great Leap Forward, primarily due to the existence of many problems in the ideological understanding of some cadres. For example, some Party committees did not adequately recognize the importance of grasping ideology and the role of newspapers and periodicals in guiding work; some news work cadres had serious "purely business viewpoints" and "expert-run newspaper thinking"; some Party members did not clearly recognize their responsibilities and obligations to the Party newspaper, and so on. If these ideological problems are not resolved, it will be difficult to handle the various relationships in newspaper work well. Therefore, we must constantly strengthen ideological education, improve everyone's understanding of the principle of the whole party running newspapers, and thereby mobilize the forces of all aspects to work together to run newspapers well.

	In terms of strengthening ideological education, we have done a lot of work in various ways in recent years. First, we conscientiously implemented the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong on newspaper work. Since 1957, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have made many important instructions on newspaper work, such as emphasizing the important role of newspapers, requiring Party committees at all levels to grasp newspapers well, and calling on the whole Party to learn to write, and Party committees at all levels in Anhui Province have conscientiously discussed them. Second, on the basis of the rectification and anti-rightist struggle, on the one hand, we criticized the phenomenon of some Party committees not caring about newspapers and some news cadres not relying on the Party committee, and on the other hand, we persisted in implementing the system of cadres being sent down to labor and editors and reporters rotating with each other, so that editors and reporters further established the viewpoint of relying on the Party committee and relying on the whole Party to run newspapers in criticism and self-criticism and practical exercise. Third, we regularly used various meetings to talk about the whole party running newspapers, calling on all Party members to care about newspapers and participate in newspaper work, and using this as a standard to check the strength of Party members' Party spirit. Fourth, we arranged reporting and writing tasks at the same time as arranging work, so that reporting and writing work became a part of the entire work, thereby arousing the attention of Party committees at all levels and various departments to this work. Because these measures were adopted, a solid ideological foundation was laid for further implementing the principle of the whole party running newspapers.

	With improved ideological understanding and a corrected attitude, if there are no good organizational forms, no appropriate leadership methods, and no appropriate working methods, it will still be impossible to fully mobilize the forces of all aspects and implement the principle of the whole party running newspapers. This forces us to adopt new methods to adapt to the new situation. Our methods are mainly:

	First, the first secretary takes command to grasp newspaper work, changing the past practice of simply handing newspapers over to the propaganda department. Newspapers are an important aspect of the Party's ideological work, and they are related to the implementation of the Party's various principles and policies, and they must be done well by the first secretary personally grasping them. If the first secretary does not grasp them, in the situation of an all-round leap forward in various tasks, it will be difficult for newspaper work to be put on the agenda of the Party committee and it will be squeezed out by other tasks, so that the Party's leadership over newspapers cannot be strengthened and the whole party running newspapers cannot be realized.

	Second, establish a leading group. It is not enough for the first secretary to take command alone, but there must also be some assistants, an organization, and a "General Staff" to coordinate the relations of all aspects. We have established a writing leading group in Party committees above the county level, with the first secretary as the leader and the heads of the propaganda department and other relevant departments and news units participating, to uniformly study and arrange the reporting and writing plans of the Party newspapers and Party periodicals at this level and to the Party newspapers and Party periodicals at the higher level and the Xinhua News Agency, determine important reporting and article topics, discuss the basic content of important manuscripts, and assign writing tasks.

	Third, strengthen and expand the writing force and combine writing work with investigation and research work. It is not enough to have a leading group, but there must also be some writers to carry out the work of collecting materials and analyzing and processing them. Otherwise, there will be no soldiers with generals, and many writing plans will fall through. Especially in the situation of the Great Leap Forward, the experience of all aspects is very rich, and there are many things to write, and it is necessary to expand the writing force to meet the needs. Party committees and various departments in various places, cities, and counties in our province have established writing groups in accordance with the instructions of the provincial Party committee, drawing a group of cadres from leading cadres and theoretical teams at all levels to engage in writing full-time, and combining the writing groups with the original investigation and research groups into a writing force directly under the leadership of the Party committee. The Party committees' correspondent groups of communes and factories and mines have also been equipped with part-time writing cadres.

	Fourth, we insisted on the practice of decentralizing writing and decentralizing reporters. The newspaper editorial department handed over some editorials, typical reports, or special pages to the Party committees below to write; the reporters were handed over to the Party committees in the resident areas to lead and used as a part of the local writing force for unified use, fully relying on the Party committees at all levels to run newspapers.

	These methods, in summary, are the method of walking on two legs and the method of three combinations under the leadership of the Party committee. The so-called walking on two legs, in terms of the entire news work force, there are professional and non-professional; in terms of the non-professional force, there are full-time and part-time writing cadres directly led by the Party committee, and a large number of correspondents distributed on various fronts and in various corners; in terms of a Party committee's communications organization, there are full-time and part-time. The so-called three combinations, in terms of the entire newspaper work, is the combination of Party committee leadership, professional news workers, and the vast number of correspondents; in terms of an important report, it is the combination of leading cadres, writers, and the masses; in terms of the working methods of writers, it is the combination of work, writing, and learning.

	What should be particularly pointed out here is that the writing group led by the first secretary is a new development in implementing the whole party running newspapers in the past two years, and it is a good organizational form for realizing the method of walking on two legs and the method of three combinations. Because it works directly under the leadership of the Party committee, has a closer connection with practical work, and can take the time to specialize in writing, it has become an important reliance of newspapers and news agencies, a good school for cultivating writing cadres, and a link connecting the vast number of correspondents. As a result, not only has the correspondent team grown stronger and more complete, but the connection between them has also become closer, so that they can better complete the writing tasks in the Great Leap Forward.

	This set of methods was inspired by the spirit of the general line and gradually developed in the situation of the Great Leap Forward. Facts have proved that as long as we conscientiously implement the methods of walking on two legs and the methods of three combinations, we can better solve the above-mentioned six relationship issues.

	Some Effects of Implementing the Principle of the Whole Party Running Newspapers

	In the past two years, after we adopted the above-mentioned series of methods in implementing the principle of the whole party running newspapers, new situations have emerged in both newspaper work and writing work. We can now see some of the following benefits:

	First, we have resolved the contradiction between tasks and forces and have completed the propaganda and reporting tasks of various periods in a more timely, accurate, comprehensive, and profound manner. In the past, important interview tasks mainly relied on reporters, and writing reviews mainly relied on editors, but the number of reporters and editors was limited, so they often lost sight of the other, and many important reports and reviews could not be carried out, or were carried out very slowly, or were of low quality. Now, the situation is different. Four-tenths of the manuscripts issued by the Anhui Branch of Xinhua News Agency in the first quarter of this year were contributions from the writing groups below. This is a new change that has never happened before. Of the reviews published by Anhui Daily from July last year to April this year, 93 were written by the writing groups of the prefectural, municipal, and county Party committees and the units directly under the provincial government, of which 32 were written by the responsible comrades of the prefectural, municipal, and county Party committees. In the past year, Hefei Daily has had 50 pages and special pages, which were mainly written by the Party committees below. Because the writing groups in various places work directly under the leadership of the Party committee, they can grasp the situation and understand the intentions of the Party committee, so they can achieve: (1) Timely reporting. As soon as a task is arranged, manuscripts are sent as the work progresses; when the newspaper editorial department encounters urgent reporting tasks, it can quickly receive the required manuscripts by soliciting manuscripts from the writing groups. (2) Accurate reporting. The topic selection and content have been studied by the Party committee, and the manuscripts have been carefully revised by the Party committee after they are written, so the facts are more reliable and the viewpoints are clearer. For example, the Fuyang County Party Committee discussed three times at the meeting of commune Party committee secretaries in order to introduce a model production team to Anhui Daily, and after repeated comparisons, it selected a Taoyuan production team, which was not only reliable but also of good quality. (3) Comprehensive reporting. There are writing groups in various regions and departments, so it helps to comprehensively reflect various tasks and helps to make the reports roughly balanced. For example, the Anhui Branch of Xinhua News Agency is now focusing its efforts on grasping the main reports, but it has not affected the overall care, and in the first quarter of this year, 52 counties have sent manuscripts to them. (4) Profound reporting. It can grasp the typical examples, grasp the key issues, give a more profound analysis of new things, and summarize and improve advanced experiences.

	Second, a group of writing cadres has been cultivated more quickly. At present, there are more than 2,000 full-time and part-time cadres in the writing groups of Party committees at all levels in our province (some were drawn from various departments, and some were cadres from the original investigation and research groups, without increasing the number of staff). In writing, because they have received direct guidance from leading cadres and the help of the masses, their political level, theoretical level, and writing level have all improved relatively quickly. Many people could not even write simple news in the past, but now they can write more substantial communications and essays. For example, the Xiaoxian County Party Committee's writing group began to write manuscripts for the provincial Party journal "Xu Yu Shi", and 34 manuscripts were not used. After the leading cadres personally intervened, the writers conducted in-depth investigation and research, and everyone worked together to improve the quality of the manuscripts. Since last year, "Xu Yu Shi" has adopted five of their manuscripts, and the People's Daily has also published seven of their manuscripts since this year. For example, the red flag manuscripts selected by Anhui Daily in April: of the 20 essays, 11 were written by the heads of the Party committees and the writing groups; of the 41 news articles, 25 were written by the writing groups; of the 11 communications, 6 were written by the writing groups. This proves that the method of three combinations not only opened up the source of manuscripts, but also opened up a new path for cultivating, strengthening, and improving the writing force.

	Third, it has promoted Party committees at all levels to earnestly summarize experience, thereby powerfully promoting work. Because to grasp the reporting, it is necessary to further understand the situation, check the materials, and find typical examples; in order to write articles, it is necessary to strengthen research, comprehensively analyze the materials, and analyze the problems. It often happens that new things are discovered in the search for reporting topics, which arouses the attention of the Party committee; in the process of writing

    关于全党办报问题
    中共安徽省委第一书记　曾希圣
    编者按：人民日报和新华总社最近在合肥召开了国内分社社长会议。中共安徽省委第一书记曾希圣同志在会上就关于全党办报问题讲了话。曾希圣同志曾将这个讲话改为文章刊登在安徽理论刊物“虚与实”第六期上。本报转载这篇文章之前，曾希圣同志又对这篇文章作了一些修改。
    全党办报，广义地来说，也就是全党办新闻事业，包括报纸，刊物，通讯社，广播电台都在内。全党办报，是我们党和毛泽东同志在新闻工作方面一贯的指导思想，也是党的群众路线在新闻工作中的具体运用。
    毛泽东同志1948年在晋绥日报编辑人员会议上的讲话中指出：“办报和办别的事一样，都要认真地办，才能办好，才能有生气。我们的报纸也要靠大家来办，靠全体人民群众来办，靠全党来办，而不能只靠少数人关起门来办。”的确，新闻事业同我们党的其他一切事业一样，都必须依靠全党，依靠全体人民群众来办。
    报纸工作由于它本身的特点，更需要依靠全党来办，依靠全体人民群众来办。报纸工作的特点是范围广，内容多，思想性强，时间性强。它不但要宣传贯彻党的总路线和党的各种方针政策，而且涉及到党的各项具体工作，涉及到全党全民的思想和行动，涉及到生产和生活的各个领域。凡是党委要抓的事情，凡是群众所关心的事情，除有关国家机密以外，报纸都要及时地反映和宣传。报纸的巨大作用正像1958年毛泽东同志给刘建勋、韦国清同志的信中指出的：“一张省报，对于全省工作，全体人民，有极大的组织、鼓舞、激励、批判、推动的作用。”问题很明显，报纸要完成这样重大的使命，决不是少数人所能办到的，只有在党委直接领导下，依靠全党的力量，依靠全体人民群众的力量，才能使自己真正成为党和群众的耳目喉舌，成为指导工作和推动工作的有力工具，成为党联系千百万群众的重要纽带。
    我们的报纸一向就是遵循着毛泽东同志的教导，根据全党办报的方针来进行工作的，但贯彻的程度是各有不同的。多年来的事实证明：哪里全党办报的方针贯彻得好，哪里的报纸就办得生气勃勃；哪里全党办报的方针贯彻得不好，哪里的报纸就办得死气沉沉。1958年大跃进以来，全党办报进入了一个新的阶段，各级党组织对报纸的领导大大加强了，报纸同党组织以及广大党员、广大群众的关系大大密切了，报纸的面貌普遍起了显著的变化，报纸的质量普遍有了很大的提高，这就是进一步执行全党办报方针的结果，就是进一步贯彻毛泽东同志办报思想的结果。
    贯彻执行全党办报方针必须解决的几个关系问题
    全党办报的方针提出已经很久了，它的必要性和正确性是大家都知道的。但是，怎样才能在实际工作中贯彻得好，这是需要经常进行研究的问题。根据这几年来的摸索，我们体会到，要真正做到全党办报，必须很好地解决以下几个关系问题。
     党委与报纸的关系
     第一，是党委与报纸的关系问题。这是办报工作中的组织领导问题，是贯彻全党办报的最根本的问题。
    报纸是党的报纸，是党的宣传鼓动工具，因此党委和报纸是领导与被领导的关系，这是大家都理解的，而且中央早有决定。问题在于它们之间究竟应当成为一种什么样的领导与被领导的关系。
     在这个问题上，安徽省过去曾经存在这样两种不同的情况：一种是泛泛的一般的领导关系，另一种是密切的、呼吸相关的领导关系。第一种关系的主要表现：在党委方面，单纯委托宣传部管报纸，宣传部管报纸是对的，而且是必须的，但党委直接抓的少，报纸办好办坏交由报社同志负责，党委只是找他们参加一些有关方针、原则问题的会议，审阅一些重要稿件。在报社方面，不是很好地依靠党委，只是照例参加一些会议，对党委的意图不甚了解，因而就不能主动地、创造性地按照党委的意图办事。第二种关系，情况就大不相同：党委亲自抓报纸工作，党委各部门也抓与自己有关的宣传报道，把必须宣传报道的东西统一规划，定期安排，并经常检查督促，真正把报纸当成实现自己领导任务的有力工具，把办好报纸当成自己应负的责任。报社也自觉地把自己当作党委的一个组成部分，在工作中积极主动地提出问题，处处按照党委意图办事。
    在上级党报、通讯社的记者与下级党委的关系上，也有两种不同的情况：一种是“主人”和“客人”的关系，一种是结成一体的关系。所谓“主客”关系，就是党委对记者以客礼相待，他们有困难不主动积极地去帮助解决，有缺点不予批评，实际上是让他们自生自长；记者则认为自己是上级派来的，不主动了解当地党委的意图，不积极依靠当地党委进行工作，形成单枪匹马，孤军奋斗；还有个别意识不好的记者，在下面看不起工农出身的领导干部，不尊重他们的意见，结果脱离实际，脱离群众。由于上级党报、通讯社的记者与下级党委之间是条条与块块的关系，所以稍不注意，便容易形成“主客”关系。结成一体的关系，就是党委把上级派来的记者当作本地组织机构的组成人员，当作自己的有力助手；记者也主动依靠党委进行工作，遇事请示党委，按照党委的指导办事。在这种情况下，记者就能够取得支持，较好地完成自己的任务。列宁在“关于出版‘工人报’的通知”中曾说过：“我们要依靠地方组织和各个工人小组的帮助，因为只有他们对报纸的积极协助，只有他们的支持，他们的反映，他们的文章、稿件、报道和意见，才能使‘工人报’站得住脚，并保证出下去。”列宁的这些话虽然是很早以前说的，但今天仍然是我们办好报纸必须遵循的原则。1958年人民日报和新华总社把分社（记者站）下放给省委，分社直接归省委领导，分社就完全成为省委机关的一个组成部分。省委对分社的工作，不只是在政治上领导，在业务上也领导；分社完全服从省委的领导，主动、积极而且创造性地按照省委的指示作好对人民日报和新华总社的发稿工作。这是中央报纸和通讯社记者和省委的关系的一个新的发展，两年来的事实证明，这样做是十分正确的。
    党委的责任，就是要防止和改变前一种不正常的关系，建立和健全后一种正常的关系。为此，各级党委要切实改进和加强对新闻工作的领导，要像毛泽东同志所指示的那样，一年抓四次，一季抓一次，并要在平时多过问报纸工作。新闻干部要自觉地加强组织性、纪律性，坚决依靠党的力量开展新闻业务工作，把自己的活动和党的思想、党的工作完全结合起来。只有建立和健全这样的关系，才能使报纸真正成为党的有力工具。党员与报纸的关系
    第二，是党员与报纸的关系问题。党员参加办报以及广大读者参加办报是全党办报的主要标志之一，正确解决党员与报纸的关系、广大读者与报纸的关系，是办好报纸的一个重要保证。
    毛泽东同志在“‘中国工人’发刊词”中说：“一个报纸既已办起来，就要当作一件事办，一定要把它办好。这不但是办的人的责任，也是看的人的责任。看的人提出意见，写短信短文寄去，表示欢喜什么，不欢喜什么，这是很重要的，这样才能使这个报办得好。”这里把看报人，也就是把读者同党报的关系说得非常清楚。党报的一般读者尚且应该如此，作为党员读者对党报尤其应该关心和支持。报纸是党的事业的重要部分，党员是党的细胞。因此，报纸要关心党的生活、党的活动，提高党员的思想理论水平，帮助党员解决工作中的困难；党员要积极为报纸工作，积极写稿，给报纸提意见，组织群众读报，扩大报纸在群众中的影响。
    在党员与报纸的关系上，根本的问题是党员对待报纸的态度问题，因为只有党员积极帮助报纸，参加报纸工作，把报纸办得生动活泼，丰富多彩，才能使报纸适合党员自己的需要。在党员对待报纸的态度问题上，有两种不同的情况，一种是只看不帮，或者只看消息，不认真学习报纸上的重要文章，甚至有个别的人根本不注意看报。另一种是既看又学，既学又帮，投寄稿件，反映情况，帮助发行。前一种没有尽到党员应有的义务，后一种才是党员对报纸应有的态度。
    党委的责任就是要经常教育和督促党员，建立起和报纸的正确关系。要使所有党员懂得，党的报纸办得好不好，每个党员都有一份责任，每个党员都应当对党的机关报贡献自己的力量。列宁曾经说过：“希望所有把这个机关报看作自己的机关报，所有认识到社会民主党（按：即后来的共产党）人党员义务的人，永远抛掉通常对待合法报纸那种资产阶级的想法和行动的习惯：他们的事是写，我们的事是读。所有社会民主党人都应当为社会民主党的报纸工作。”在这里列宁向我们明确指出了党员对党报所应当采取的正确态度。
    因此，读者，尤其是党员对报纸的责任，归纳起来说，就是读，写，用，帮。读就是要认真读报，从报纸上学习时事，学习政策，学习经验，学习文化科学知识，提高自己的政治、理论和业务水平。写就是要积极写稿，反映本地区、本部门的工作情况，总结工作中的经验，发表对于各种理论问题和实际工作问题的意见。不但自己动手写，还要组织别人写。用就是要经常利用报纸指导工作，进行宣传教育，提高群众的觉悟，鼓舞群众的干劲，推广各种成功的经验。帮就是要帮助报纸改进工作，经常向报纸提供情况，反映群众的意见，提出批评建议，并协助做好报纸的发行工作。只有大家都切实担负起这样的责任，才能保证把报纸办好，才能充分发挥它的宣传作用和组织作用。
    专业人员与非专业人员的关系
    第三，是新闻工作的专业人员和非专业人员的关系问题。这是培养和壮大党的写作队伍的问题。
    新闻工作的专业人员与非专业人员各有特点，前者有较丰富的业务知识和一定的写作水平，是一支很宝贵的力量，但他们以办报和办通讯社为专业，不能参加实际工作，人数也较少；后者人多面广，是实际斗争的直接参加者，掌握的材料最具体、最可靠，能从各个不同的角度反映工作中的实际情况，反映群众的要求，但写作水平一般要差一些，当然也有一些人写作水平较高。这是另一支重要的写作力量。这两股力量必须很好结合起来，才能充分发挥他们在全党办报中的作用。
    在专业人员与非专业人员之间，有两种不同的关系：一种是各行其事，互不来往，或者专业人员看不起非专业人员；另一种是大家取长补短，互相帮助，共同完成写作任务。只有按照后一种关系进行工作，才能把报纸办好，并使大家迅速得到提高。列宁曾经说过：要“防止非常普遍而且对事业危害极大的误会。这种误会就是，似乎就是作家而且仅仅是作家（从职业的意义上讲）能够成功地参加机关报的工作；恰恰相反，如果五个做领导工作的、经常写作的作家加上五百、五千个非作家的工作人员，机关报就会是生动活泼、有生命力的。”毛泽东同志对专家与非专家的关系问题说的更清楚，他说：专门家要“一方面帮助他们（按指非专家——引者），指导他们，一方面又向他们学习，从他们吸收由群众中来的养料，把自己充实起来，丰富起来，使自己的专门不致成为脱离群众、脱离实际、毫无内容、毫无生气的空中楼阁。”这段话虽然是对文艺工作者说的，但对新闻工作者也是完全适用的。因此，专业新闻工作者必须担负更多的责任，加强和非专业人员的联系，帮助他们提高业务水平，并取得他们对自己帮助。
    党委的责任，是要防止和克服前一种不正常的关系，建立和加强后一种正常的关系。如果打个比喻，就是要帮助他们建立起像部队的主力军（中央报纸的记者）、地方军（地方报纸的记者）和民兵（通讯员）那样的关系。主力军和地方军是部队的骨干和机动力量，民兵是主力军和地方军的有力助手和后备力量。民兵要协助主力军和地方军作战，向他们学习技术；主力军和地方军应该指导民兵作战，帮助他们提高。在新闻战线上，只有把中央报纸的记者、地方报纸的记者和通讯员很好结合起来，协同作战，才能增强办报力量，培养出更多的作者；才能使报纸和广大群众密切地联结在一起，保证报纸内容丰富多彩；才能使报纸更加大众化，适合群众的口味。
    新闻机关之间以及新闻机关与其他部门的协作关系
    第四，是新闻机关之间以及新闻机关与其他部门的协作关系的问题。这是力量的使用问题，是如何多快好省地完成写作任务的一个重要问题。
    现在要写的东西很多，但写作力量很缺乏，如何加强协作，提高写作效率，充分发挥新闻机关和其它部门的写作力量，是需要认真解决的一个重要问题。
    在这个问题上，也有两种不同的情况：一种是有些新闻机关喜欢分兵把口，各搞一套，对其它部门的写作力量不去很好地加以组织、运用；有些新闻干部喜欢单干，互不往来，只相信自己，不相信别人。另一种是统一安排，分工负责，互相支持，互相协作。前一种关系由于力量分散，材料收集不好，个人水平有限，必然造成少慢差费，发生遗漏、迟缓、质量不高和重复的现象。后一种情况说明，由于力量使用得恰当，能够有计划地进行写作，使大家既有适当分工，又能亲密合作，每个人都能在集体的帮助下集中精力去完成自己分配到的题目，这样就能及时完成写作任务，保证写作质量不断得到提高。
    党委的责任，就是要在新闻机关和新闻干部中继续批判和克服本位主义和锦标主义思想，帮助他们改变脱离群众的单干作风，教育他们树立整体观念，发扬协作精神。各级党委的宣传部门要认真抓好协作的组织工作，定期把应当写的东西作出规划，统一安排，组织各方面的力量去保证完成。各个新闻机关要密切配合，合理使用力量，根据工作需要，进行分工合作；党和政府的各个部门，要根据自己掌管的业务工作，积极组织力量为报社、通讯社写稿。这样，就能充分发挥现有人员的作用，以较少的人力写出较多较好的作品。调查研究与写作加工的关系
    第五，是调查研究与写作加工的关系问题。这是写作的基本方法问题，也是提高作品质量的关键问题。
    新闻工作的一个重要任务，就是反映实际、指导实际。要达到这个要求，既要搜集丰富的实际材料，又要认真地分析提高；既要看得出问题，又要表达得好，写出思想性较高的文章。
    在这个问题上，也有两种不同的做法：一种是把调查研究和写作加工分割开来，有些写稿的人不作调查研究工作，或者忙于写作任务，不去挤出时间进行调查研究，这样写出来的稿子必然是空话连篇，不着实际；有些搞调查研究的人，不去利用搜集来的材料写成稿子，或者在写稿的时候不把材料分析提高，结果是现象罗列，观点模糊。另一种是把两者结合起来，既搞调查研究，又搞写作加工，这样写出来的稿子，既有丰富的材料，又有正确鲜明的观点。毛泽东同志教导我们：要“详细地占有材料，在马克思列宁主义一般原理的指导下，从这些材料中引出正确的结论”。这是辩证唯物主义的工作方法，也是写作的根本原则。文章要写得好是不容易的，最根本的问题是要认真进行调查研究，并把调查研究得来的材料加以分析提高；写文章就像工厂加工一样，没有原料是不行的。但专业写作干部一般并不做实际工作，自己也不生产“原料”，原料都是群众创造的，自己只起“加工”的作用。所以专业写作干部首先要收集材料，占有材料，否则就是没有原料的加工，这样加工是不可能“加”出有用的产品的。当然仅仅占有材料也是不够的，还要善于分析提高，还要讲究逻辑和修辞，不然还不可能使写出的东西具有准确性、鲜明性和生动性。
    党委的责任，就是要在干部中加强理论联系实际的教育，使缺乏实际和缺乏理论的人各自向着自己的弱点突击，从而有效地改变前一种不正确的做法，不断发扬后一种正确的做法，把调查研究和写作加工很好地结合起来。因为只有这样，才能提高写作质量，提高报纸的思想性和指导性。
    点与面、中心工作与一般工作的关系
    第六，是新闻报道方面的点与面、中心工作与一般工作的关系问题。这是报道上的布局问题，是如何全面反映党的事业的重要问题，也是新闻工作人员如何加强与各个方面联系的问题。
    突破一点，带动全盘，抓住中心工作，推动一般工作，这是毛泽东同志一贯的工作方法，我们的报纸必须体现出这种精神。但在抓重点时又必须照顾全面，在抓中心工作时又必须照顾一般工作，这也是毛泽东同志一贯的工作方法，报纸也必须体现出这种精神。只有如此，才不致顾此失彼，才能反映出既高速度又按比例的大跃进的全貌，才能更好地鼓舞各地区、各部门的积极性，也才能更普遍更广泛地吸引各个地区各个方面的干部和群众来关心报纸、利用报纸和帮助报纸。
    在这个问题上，同样存在着两种情况：一种是抓住了点，丢掉了面，抓住了中心工作，丢掉了一般工作，或者不依靠党委来发现和掌握重点，而以自己主观的想法来框定重点。另一种是既抓住重点，又关照全面，既积极培养原有重点，又从客观情况中去发现新的重点，既抓住中心工作，又兼顾一般工作。
    大跃进以来，中心工作与一般工作的报道问题已经基本上得到解决，但是对于点与面的报道问题，仍然有一些人认识不大清楚，他们没有深刻理解到：各个地区在党中央统一领导下，总的方针、原则都是一致的，但由于各个地区发展情况不同，工作进度不同，因此在工作步骤和做法上也常常有所不同。如果只抓住个别重点进行报道，就不可能代表全面，因而也就不可能推动全面；如果只注意自己培养的重点，或自己经常抓的重点，不去发现群众运动中涌现出来的新事物，就必然会埋没群众的首创精神。而且，所谓重点地区也是相对的，今天在前，明天可能在后，这件事在前，另一件事可能在后。所以抓重点必须从实际出发，这样才能准确地反映重点，也才能更好地推动全面。
    党委的责任，就是要教育新闻干部时时刻刻重视下面的实际情况，帮助他们在工作中做好全面安排，既要有计划地抓住重点，又要灵活地掌握重点，既能抓好中心工作，又能照顾一般工作，把点与面、中心工作和一般工作很好地结合起来，以适应全面跃进的新形势。
    上面六个问题，归总起来，就是如何在党委的统一领导下，联系实际，联系群众，组织和运用各方面的力量，改进工作方法来办好报纸的问题。只有正确地解决这些关系，全党办报的方针才能真正体现出来，才能把报纸办得更好。贯彻执行全党办报方针的几点体会
    要解决好上面所说的几个关系问题，真正做到全党办报，必须从两方面进行工作：一方面加强思想教育，一方面加强组织领导和改进工作方法。
    就安徽地区的情况来看，大跃进以前在报纸工作中有些关系没有完全解决好，首先是由于部分干部在思想认识上存在着许多问题。例如，有些党委对抓意识形态的重要性认识不足，对报纸、刊物在指导工作中的作用认识不足；有些新闻工作干部存在着严重的“单纯业务观点”、“专家办报思想”；有些党员没有明确认识到自己对党报应尽的责任和义务，等等。这些思想问题不解决，就很难处理好报纸工作中的各种关系。所以必须不断加强思想教育，提高大家对全党办报方针的认识，从而调动各方面的力量，共同努力办好报纸。
    在加强思想教育方面，这几年来我们通过各种方式进行了许多工作。第一、认真贯彻了党中央和毛泽东同志关于报纸工作的指示。1957年以来，党中央和毛泽东同志关于报纸工作所作的多次重要指示，如强调报纸的重要作用，要求各级党委抓好报纸，号召全党学习写作等，安徽省各级党委都认真地进行了讨论。第二、在整风和反右派斗争的基础上，一方面批判了某些党委不关心报纸，某些新闻干部不依靠党委的现象，一方面坚持执行了干部下放劳动，编辑、记者互相轮换等制度，使编辑、记者在批评自我批评和实际锻炼中进一步树立了依靠党委、依靠全党办报的观点。第三、经常利用各种会议，大讲全党办报，号召全体党员关心报纸，参加办报工作，并以此作为检查党员党性强弱的一个标准。第四、在布置工作的同时布置报道写作任务，使报道写作工作成为整个工作的一部分，从而引起各级党委和各个部门对这一工作的重视。由于采取了这些措施，就为进一步贯彻全党办报的方针，打下了牢固的思想基础。
    思想认识提高了，态度端正了，如果没有好的组织形式，没有适当的领导方法和工作方法，仍然不能将各方面的力量充分调动起来，把全党办报的方针贯彻下去。这就逼使我们必须采取新的办法，来适应新的形势。我们的办法主要是：
    第一、第一书记挂帅抓报纸工作，改变了过去把报纸单纯交给宣传部的做法。报纸是党的思想工作的一个重要方面，它关系到党的各项方针政策的贯彻执行，必须由第一书记亲自抓才能搞好。第一书记如果不抓，在各项工作全面跃进的情况下，报纸工作就很难排上党委的议事日程，就会被别的工作挤掉，这样党对报纸的领导就不可能加强，全党办报也就不可能实现。
    第二、建立领导小组。单是第一书记挂帅还不行，还要有一些助手，有一个组织，有一个“参谋部”，才能使各方面的关系协调起来。我们在县以上党委建立了以第一书记为组长，有宣传部以及其它有关部门和新闻单位的负责人参加的写作领导小组，统一研究和安排本级党报党刊以及对上级党报党刊和新华社的报道、写作计划，确定重要的报道和文章选题，讨论重要稿件的基本内容，分配写作任务。
    第三、加强和扩大写作队伍，把写作工作与调查研究工作结合起来。有了领导小组也还不够，还要有一些写作人手，进行收集材料和分析加工的工作。否则，有将无兵，许多写作计划就会落空。特别是在大跃进的形势下，各个方面的经验都很丰富，要写的东西很多，只有扩大写作队伍，才能适应需要。我省各地、市、县委和各个部门都根据省委指示成立了写作小组，从各级领导干部和理论队伍中抽调了一批干部，专职从事写作，并把写作小组和原有的调查研究组合为一体，形成了一支在党委直接领导下的写作队伍。公社和厂矿企业的党委通讯组，也配备了兼职的写作干部。
    第四、坚持了写作下放，记者下放的做法。报纸编辑部把部分社论、典型报道或者专页，交下面党委编写；把记者交给驻地党委领导，作为当地写作力量的一部分统一使用，充分依靠各级党委办报。
    这些办法，概括起来，就是在党委领导下的两条腿走路和三结合的办法。所谓两条腿走路，就整个新闻工作队伍讲，有专业与非专业；就非专业的队伍讲，有党委直接领导的专职和兼职的写作干部，有分布在各个战线、各个角落的大批通讯员；就一个党委通讯组织讲，有专职与兼职。所谓三结合，就整个报纸工作讲，是党委领导、专业新闻工作人员与广大通讯员相结合；就一个重要报道讲，是领导干部、写作人员和群众相结合；就写作人员的工作方法讲，是工作、写作和学习相结合。
    这里特别要指出的是，以第一书记挂帅的写作小组，这一组织形式是近两年来贯彻全党办报的新发展，是实现两条腿走路、三结合的很好的组织形式。因为它在党委直接领导下进行工作，对实际工作有较密切的联系，又能抽出时间专门担任写作，所以它就成为报纸、通讯社的重要依靠力量，成为培养写作干部的良好学校，成为联系广大通讯员的纽带。结果不仅通讯队伍壮大了，兵种更全了，而且他们彼此之间的联系更加密切起来了，所以就能够较好地完成大跃进中的写作任务。
    这一套办法，是受了总路线精神的启示而摸索出来的，是在大跃进的形势下逐步发展起来的。事实证明，只要认真实行两条腿走路和三结合的办法，就可以较好地解决上面所说的六个关系问题。
    贯彻执行全党办报方针的一些效果
    两年来，我们在贯彻全党办报的方针上采取了上述一系列办法以后，报纸工作和写作工作都出现了新的局面。现在已经能看到这样一些好处：
    第一，解决了任务和力量的矛盾，比较及时、准确、全面、深刻地完成了各个时期的宣传报道任务。过去重要的采访任务主要靠记者，写评论主要靠编辑，而记者和编辑人数有限，所以常常顾此失彼，有很多重要的报道和评论搞不起来，搞得很慢，或者质量不高。现在，情况就不同了。新华社安徽分社今年第一季度所发的稿件，有十分之四是下边写作组的来稿。这是过去从来没有过的新变化。安徽日报去年7月至今年4月发表的评论中，地、市、县委和省直属各单位写作组写的有九十三篇，其中地、市、县委负责同志写的就有三十二篇。合肥日报去年一年中，有五十个版面和专页，主要是依靠下边党委编写的。各地的写作组由于在党委直接领导下进行工作，能掌握情况，了解党委意图，所以能够做到：（1）报道及时。一项工作布置下去，随着工作的进行就有稿件寄来；报纸编辑部遇到紧急报道任务，向写作组约稿，很快就可以收到需要的稿件。（2）报道准确。选题和内容经过党委研究，稿子写成后又经过党委认真修改，所以事实比较可靠，观点比较鲜明。例如阜阳县委为向安徽日报介绍一个模范生产队，曾在公社党委书记会议上讨论了三次，经过反复比较，才挑选出了一个桃园生产队，结果不仅确实可靠，而且质量也较好。（3）报道全面。各个地区、各个部门都有写作小组，所以有助于全面反映各项工作，有助于使报道大体平衡。例如新华社安徽分社现在集中力量抓主要报道，可是并没有影响全面的照顾，今年第一季度，就有五十二个县向他们发稿。（4）报道深刻。能抓住典型，抓住关键问题，对新生事物能给以较深刻的分析，对先进经验能总结提高，有实有虚。
    第二，较快地培养了一批写作干部。现在我省各级党委写作组共有专职和兼职干部两千多人（有的是从各部门抽出来的，有的是原来的调查研究组干部，未增加编制名额）。他们在写作中，由于得到领导干部的直接指导和群众的帮助，所以政治水平、理论水平、写作水平的提高都比较快。不少人过去连简单新闻也写不好，现在已能写出较有分量的通讯、论文。例如萧县县委写作组开始给省委党刊“虚与实”写稿，连投三十四篇未用，经过领导干部亲自动手，写作人员深入调查研究，大家集体努力，提高了稿件质量，去年以来，“虚与实”已采用他们五篇稿子，今年以来人民日报也发表了他们七篇稿子。又如安徽日报4月份评选的红旗稿件：论文二十篇，其中十一篇是党委负责人和写作组写的；新闻四十一篇，其中二十五篇是写作组写的；通讯十一篇，其中六篇是写作组写的。这就证明：三结合的办法，不仅开辟了稿源，而且为培养、壮大和提高写作队伍开辟了新的道路。
    第三，推动了各级党委认真地总结经验，从而有力地推动了工作。因为要抓报道，就必须进一步摸情况，查材料，找典型；为了写文章，就必须加强研究，综合材料，分析问题。常常有这样的情况：在找报道题材中发现了新的事物，引起了党委对它的重视；在写文章的过程中，总结了经验，提高了认识，使经验更完善起来。例如东至县1959年春季实现了耕牛配种满怀县，写作组开始写了一篇稿子，没有写好，后来召集全县畜牧技术干部和兽医座谈，又派写作干部深入公社调查，经过集体研究，分析提高，稿子写好了，一套经验也就总结出来了。又如合肥市委对文教大协作虽然很重视，但是经验没有总结起来，为了组织报道，由书记挂帅，调集了十多个写作干部，吸收有关文教单位参加研究，搞了十多天，把问题摸透了，把经验系统地总结出来了；稿件发表后，又推动了全市文教大协作的进一步发展。
    以上事实说明，采取两条腿走路和三结合的办法，对办报、培养写作干部、推动工作，都起到了多快好省的作用，都符合于总路线的要求。现在看来这一套办法，对实现新闻工作持续的全面的大跃进，是一个可靠的保证。
    我们在全党办报方面虽然做了一些工作，收到了一些效果，但是也还存在不少问题，主要是：发展还不平衡，有的党委对写作报道工作抓得还不认真；有些干部在写作中还没有很好运用三结合的方法，写作的稿件质量还不高。此外，还出现了一个新的问题，稿件增多了，但报刊篇幅有限，许多稿件登不出来，有些干部的写作情绪因此受到了影响。对于这些问题，我们采取了以下办法来解决。第一，要求各地党委进一步加强对报纸工作的领导，普遍贯彻两条腿走路和三结合的办法，经常抓计划、抓检查、抓重点题目。第二，要求写作干部努力学习理论，学习党的政策，学习写作技巧；在写作中要养成调查研究和分析问题的习惯。要主动取得领导干部的指导和群众的帮助，以不断提高写作质量。第三，要求各级组织加强对写作干部的思想教育工作，把他们的写作积极性引导到正确的方向，防止因稿件未被采用而泄气。同时，要帮助写作干部扩大写作范围，不但写报道，还要写论文，写经验总结；要和各地报刊加强联系，争取有更多的稿件在各种报刊和各级报刊发表。
    现在，社会主义建设事业正在以大跃进的速度持续前进，在这种形势下，报纸所肩负的任务更加重大了。这就要求我们在贯彻全党办报的方针方面，作出更大的努力，充分发扬已有的成绩，及时解决新出现的问题，把报纸办得更好，更有力地推动大跃进飞速发展。我们相信，在毛泽东思想的指引下，只要我们坚持贯彻全党办报的方针，不断努力，不断前进，就一定能够完成报纸所担负的光荣任务！
