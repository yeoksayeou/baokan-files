Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 31st: The "Soviet Sports Newspaper" today published on its seventh page, with substantial space, the congratulatory telegrams from the Soviet Sports Association and the Federation of Sports Organizations, and the Soviet Mountaineering Association, to the Chinese National Sports Commission and the Mountaineering Association, along with commentaries, interviews, and pictures related to the Chinese mountaineering team's ascent to the highest peak.

In a commentary written by Novikov, it was pointed out that for a long time, people have been unable to conquer the highest point on our planet. Ascending Mount Everest has always been the "number one problem" in mountaineering. Many experts have consistently believed that climbing from the north slope of the Himalayas is impossible. The author wrote: The news that three Chinese mountaineers reached the summit of Mount Everest from the north slope surprised experts studying the Himalayas.

The newspaper also published short articles by three prominent Soviet mountaineers, with an editor's note: "Extraordinary sporting event."

Soviet Hero, Honored Test Pilot Siyanov said, "I participated in climbing the highest peak in the Soviet Union, Stalin Peak (7,495 meters). Therefore, I can appreciate the difficulties experienced by the Chinese athletes who conquered Mount Everest. We used to only dream of climbing such a high peak, but for man, nothing is impossible. The free sons of a free people – Communist Party member Wang Fuzhou and Qu Yinhua, and People's Liberation Army soldier Gonbu – have once again brilliantly proven this."

Soviet Honored Mountaineer Abalakov and prominent Soviet mountaineer Rototaev also wrote articles praising the great achievements of the Chinese mountaineers.

    祝贺中国健儿登上地球最高峰
    苏联“体育报”载文盛赞我国登山运动员的光辉创举
    据新华社莫斯科31日电　“苏联体育报”今天在第七版以大量篇幅刊登了苏体育协会和体育组织联合会和苏联登山协会给中国国家体委及登山协会的贺电，有关中国登山队登上最高峰的评述、谈话和图片。
    在诺维科夫写的一篇评述中指出，人们很久以来都不能征服我们行星上的最高点。登上珠穆朗玛峰在登山运动中一直是个“第一号问题”。许多专家一直都认为从喜马拉雅山的北坡攀登是不可能的。作者写道：三位中国登山运动员从北坡登上了珠穆朗玛峰的消息使得研究喜马拉雅山的专家都表示惊奇。
    这家报纸还在加上“卓越的体育事件”的按语后发表了三位苏联著名登山运动员的短文。
    苏联英雄、功勋试飞员希亚诺夫说，我曾参加过攀登苏联最高的斯大林峰（七千四百九十五米）。因此征服珠穆朗玛峰的中国运动员所经历的困难，我是能够体会的。我们过去曾经只是向往过攀登这样的高峰，但对人来说，是没有不可能的事情的，自由人民的自由儿子——共产党员王富洲和屈银华，中国人民解放军战士贡布又一次光辉地证明了这一点。
    苏联功勋登山运动员阿巴拉科夫、苏联著名的登山运动员罗托塔耶夫，也分别撰文盛赞中国登山运动员所取得的伟大成就。
