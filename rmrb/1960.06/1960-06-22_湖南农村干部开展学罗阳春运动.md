Xinhua News Agency report:

    Hunan rural cadres are vigorously launching a movement to "learn from Luo Yangchun, catch up with Luo Yangchun, and be like Luo Yangchun." Through discussions of Luo Yangchun's deeds, various localities have further promoted the fine style of hard work and in-depth action and the mass line working methods among cadres.

    Luo Yangchun is a young woman of twenty-one years old. She was originally the Women's Director of the Sihu Brigade of the Shuanghua Commune in Yuanjiang County. This spring, she was appointed as the Party Branch Secretary of the backward Dongting Red Production Team. On the morning of the second day after she arrived at the production team, she invited female commune member Sun Xiuying to go out to work together to accumulate fertilizer. On the third day, she braved the torrential rain and mobilized everyone to dredge drainage ditches for the green manure fields and rapeseed fields. Under her leadership, all the male and female commune members who had rain gear turned out, and in one afternoon, the drainage ditches for eighty-four mu of land were neatly dug and the water flowed out. Because Luo Yangchun often worked with the masses in production, the commune members reported many situations to her, which enabled her to understand the reasons for the backwardness of this production team. Therefore, under the leadership of the Party General Branch, she conducted education on the class line and the mass line for the branch members and made specific divisions of labor. In addition to taking the lead in production themselves, they also ensured that their whole families took the lead to achieve "red families." Under the leadership of the Party Branch, a high tide of fertilizer accumulation and spring plowing was rapidly launched in the team, and a group of selfless, active poor and lower-middle peasants participated in the leadership of the production team, forming the team's leadership advantage.

    In order to improve production, in addition to actively taking the lead in production, she also went deep into the canteen, planted "experimental fields," mobilized the planting of vegetables, and engaged in sideline occupations, so that the commune members could eat their fill and eat well at every meal. Everyone was satisfied, and their enthusiasm was even greater.

    Now, this backward production team has been transformed into an advanced production team in the whole commune, full of enthusiasm and vitality everywhere. The whole team completed the transplanting of early rice before the Beginning of Summer, and the seedlings are currently growing lush green. The commune members are taking advantage of the victory to do a good job in field management, striving for early ripening and high yield of early rice.

    In mid-May, the Xin Hunan Bao (New Hunan Daily), the organ of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, published Luo Yangchun's model deeds and published an editorial entitled "Learn from Luo Yangchun." Then, it launched a discussion in the newspaper on "Learning from Luo Yangchun, promoting the fine style of the mass line." This is a mass line self-education movement for rural grassroots cadres, which has received widespread attention from Party organizations at all levels throughout the province. Many prefectural and county committees have issued notices on learning from Luo Yangchun's model deeds.

    In the movement of "learning from Luo Yangchun, catching up with Luo Yangchun, and being like Luo Yangchun," the vast number of cadres not only learned Luo Yangchun's method of using class analysis to view things, but also paid attention to cultivating such a strong class feeling as Luo Yangchun. Many cadres made close friends with poor and lower-middle peasants, enlightening and helping them to raise their ideological awareness. Especially during the Great Battle of Red May, many cadres took the lead in overcoming difficulties, eating, living, working, and discussing with the masses, which vigorously promoted the current central work. Encouraged by Luo Yangchun's model deeds, many cadres have asked the organization to transfer them to the most difficult places.

    湖南农村干部开展学罗阳春运动
    罗阳春深入实际，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动，办好食堂，搞好生产，模范地执行了党的群众路线的工作方法，迅速改变了后进队的面貌。
    据新华社讯　在湖南省广大农村干部中，正在蓬勃地展开一个“学罗阳春、赶罗阳春、和罗阳春一个样”的运动。各地通过对罗阳春事迹的讨论，在干部中进一步发扬了艰苦深入的优良作风和群众路线的工作方法。
    罗阳春是一个二十一岁的年轻姑娘。她原来是沅江县双华公社泗湖大队的妇女主任，今年春天才到后进的洞庭红生产队任党支部书记。她到了生产队的第二天清早，就邀了女社员孙秀英一起出工积肥。第三天，她又冒着倾盆大雨，发动大家为绿肥田、油菜田开沟排水。在她的带动下，全队有雨具的男女社员都出动了，一个下午，八十四亩田的排水沟都开得整整齐齐，水都流了出去。由于罗阳春经常和群众在一起生产劳动，社员们向她反映了许多情况，使她弄清了这个生产队落后的原因。于是，她在党总支的领导下，对支部党员进行了阶级路线和群众路线的教育并作了具体分工，他们除自己带头生产外，并且保证全家带头，做到“全家红”。在党支部的领导下，队里的积肥、春耕高潮迅速开展起来，一批大公无私、工作积极的贫农和下中农参加了生产队的领导，形成了队里的领导优势。
  为了把生产搞得更好，她除了在生产中积极带头外并深入食堂，种“试验田”，发动种蔬菜，搞副业，使社员每餐都吃得饱，吃得好，人人满意，干劲更足。
    现在，这个后进生产队已一变而为全公社的先进生产队，处处热气腾腾，生气勃勃。全队在立夏前就插完了早稻，目前禾苗长得一片葱绿，社员们正乘胜搞好田间管理，力争早稻早熟高产。
    5月中旬，中共湖南省委机关报——新湖南报刊载了罗阳春的模范事迹，并且发表了题为“向罗阳春学习”的社论；接着又在报纸上开展了“学赶罗阳春、发扬群众路线的优良作风”的讨论。这是一次农村基层干部进行群众路线自我教育的运动，它受到了全省各地各级党组织的普遍重视，许多地委、县委都发出了关于学习罗阳春模范事迹的通知。
    在“学罗阳春、赶罗阳春、和罗阳春一个样”的运动中，广大干部不仅学习了罗阳春用阶级分析的方法来看待事物，而且注意培养像罗阳春那样强烈的阶级感情。许多干部同贫农、下中农交了知心朋友，启发和帮助他们提高思想觉悟。特别是在大战红五月中，许多干部带头克服困难，和群众同吃同住同劳动同商量，有力地推动了当前中心工作。不少干部在罗阳春模范事迹的鼓舞下，纷纷要求组织把他们调到最困难的地方去。
