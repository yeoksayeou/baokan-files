Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch from Tokyo: Two million Japanese people today launched the massive Eighteenth National Unified Action in 350 locations nationwide, holding demonstrations and rallies to strongly demand the abolition of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," the overthrow of the Kishi Nobusuke government, the cancellation of Eisenhower's visit to Japan, and the dissolution of the Diet.

This unified action will continue from today until the 19th.

In Tokyo, 240,000 people held a powerful demonstration near the Diet. This is the largest demonstration since the movement against the "Security Treaty" began.

At around 2:00 PM, the area near the Diet began to fill with workers, students, farmers, intellectuals, and citizens. They gathered on the streets around the Diet, shouting slogans such as "Down with the Kishi Cabinet" and "Oppose the 'Security Treaty.'" At 4:00 PM, demonstrators from various locations successively converged in front of the Diet.

Today's demonstrators included an unprecedentedly wide range of social strata. Farmers from Ibaraki, Niigata, Nagano, and other prefectures stopped working in the fields during the busy farming season to come to Tokyo to participate in the anti-American patriotic struggle. The delegation from Kyoto was composed of one hundred merchants—members of the Kyoto Association of Business and Industry Organizations—who held banners reading: "Don't come, Ike! Hagerty, get out!"

Many housewives and children appeared in today's demonstration ranks. Three hundred housewives from Tokyo's Koishikawa district waved small flags in demonstration near the Diet; many housewives led their children in the march.

The demonstrators carried flags with clear anti-American slogans. The flags were printed in English with "Ike and U-2, Don't come to Japan."

The Kishi Nobusuke government, intimidated by the power of the people's struggle, actually laid barbed wire around the Diet and used many police armored vehicles to "defend" the Diet grounds.

While the demonstration was taking place in front of the Diet, several groups of demonstrators began to march from the Diet to the U.S. Embassy, which was heavily guarded by Japanese police. There, people indignantly shouted slogans such as "Ike, don't come" and "American soldiers, get out!"

An army of students surrounded Kishi Nobusuke's private residence at around 6:00 PM. They were there to stage a sit-in to prevent Hagerty from going to Kishi Nobusuke's residence for talks. When they learned that Hagerty had secretly slipped away from Tokyo, a victorious laughter erupted from the demonstration ranks.

The large-scale demonstrations and rallies in Osaka, Kobe, Nagoya, and other places are also powerfully shaking the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet. It is reported that 100,000 people held a demonstration in Osaka City today.

Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch from Tokyo: The Eighteenth National Unified Action of the Japanese people against the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" began today.

The vanguard of this unified action—demonstrators composed of representatives of workers, farmers, and citizens from forty-six prefectures, shouting anti-American and anti-Kishi slogans—entered Tokyo in four mighty columns at around 9:00 AM today. At the same time, a large number of demonstrators came to Tokyo by train from various places. According to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan this afternoon, the number of these demonstrators has reached 75,000.

The large-scale demonstration is unfolding with the goal of surrounding the Diet, the U.S. Embassy, and the official residence of Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke. At the forefront of each demonstration column, huge banners are held high: "We oppose the ratification of the revised U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty.'" The straw mat banners held by farmer representatives are particularly eye-catching, with slogans written on them: Down with the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet! Dissolve the Diet immediately! Eisenhower, do not come to Japan!

This afternoon, demonstration representatives from various places first gathered at the Hibiya Open-Air Concert Hall in Tokyo, and then lined up to march to the front of the Diet Building to participate in the 200,000-person demonstration led by the National Council to Prevent Revision of the "Security Treaty."

Ioka Daiji, a member of the Diet from the Socialist Party and a representative of the National Council, spoke to all members before the departure of this mighty procession. He emphasized that Eisenhower's visit to Japan is intended to prop up the tottering Kishi Nobusuke cabinet in order to promote the ratification of the new "Security Treaty." He said that Kishi Nobusuke is attempting to solve problems with the help of foreign forces, which is the root cause of the current serious situation in Japan.

He went on to accuse Eisenhower of undermining the Four-Power Summit and then plotting to strengthen its aggressive military alliance in Asia through this visit to the Philippines, Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan.

Ioka emphasized that the peace-loving Japanese people will absolutely not allow Eisenhower, who has such a purpose, to visit Japan. Today, we will use the power of 200,000 people to surround the Diet, the Prime Minister's official residence, and the U.S. Embassy to express our strong protest.

Demonstration representatives from various places described their struggles to the press.

Yamahana Yoshitaro, a representative from Ishikawa Prefecture, said that in the movement against the new "Security Treaty," farmers in Ishikawa Prefecture are rapidly mobilizing and are conducting an anti-American and anti-Kishi struggle together with the workers. He said, "This is mainly due to the active activities of the workers in the rural areas, who helped us hold mass rallies against the 'Security Treaty,' so that the propaganda against the 'Security Treaty' penetrated deeply into the farmers."

Kawasakin Kiyomatsu, the leader of the demonstration in Gunma Prefecture, said, "In Gunma Prefecture, the movement has begun to expand to merchants, not to mention farmers, and most farmers are actively participating in the movement." Kawasakin Kiyomatsu emphasized that even if Kishi Nobusuke forces the House of Representatives to forcibly pass the new "Security Treaty," the people of Gunma will reject this treaty. Now, we are doing our best to prepare for a general strike to oppose Kishi Nobusuke's forcing the Senate to pass this treaty.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch from Tokyo: The Seventeenth National Unified Action of the Japanese people against the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," which began on May 31, ended victoriously today. Over the past eleven days, the heroic Japanese people have launched a struggle against their two main enemies—U.S. imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke clique—that was even more powerful and fierce than before, and have achieved brilliant successes.

Mizuguchi Kozo, the Director of the Secretariat of the National Council to Prevent Revision of the "Security Treaty," pointed out when talking about the characteristics of this national unified action: First, the working class victoriously held an unprecedented political general strike on June 4; second, people from all walks of life took action to participate in this struggle; and third, through this struggle, the activities against Eisenhower's visit to Japan became a political struggle for the whole people.

The June 4 general strike was an important component of this unified action and a clear symbol of the great victory of this unified action. Five million six hundred thousand workers, disregarding the suppression and sabotage of the Kishi Nobusuke government, went on strike in various enterprises and departments across the country; farmers, students, women, professors, scientists, religious figures, jurists, poets, and actors all stayed up all night with the workers from the evening of the 3rd to launch the struggle; 30,000 stores went on strike; and ordinary citizens also joined the fiery battle. Although their occupations and beliefs were different, they shouted anti-American slogans in unison, such as opposing the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, opposing Eisenhower's visit to Japan, demanding that the U.S. military withdraw "U-2" spy planes, and overthrowing the traitorous Kishi Nobusuke cabinet. This shows that the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic united front is rapidly expanding through the June 4 general strike, and the anti-American struggle has undergone new developments.

In the Seventeenth National Unified Action, the broad masses of the Japanese people became stronger and stronger in battle. Workers held strike struggles, people from all walks of life continuously held protests and demonstrations against the U.S. Embassy and the Diet every day, and more than 20 million people signed petitions demanding that Kishi Nobusuke step down and dissolve the Diet. They converged various forms of struggle into a torrent, violently impacting the foundation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, and expressed with firm confidence in victory that they would never give up until the anti-American and anti-Kishi struggle achieved final victory.

    十七次统一行动胜利结束　十八次统一行动乘胜开始
    日本两百万人民展开反美反岸新斗争
    先锋部队四路浩浩荡荡进入东京二十四万人在国会外举行大示威
    新华社11日讯　东京消息：日本两百万人今天在全国三百五十个地方举行了示威和集会等规模宏大的第十八次全国统一行动，强烈要求废除日美新“安全条约”、打倒岸信介政府、取消艾森豪威尔访问日本和解散国会。
    这次统一行动从今天起将进行到19日。
    在东京，二十四万人在国会附近举行了强大的示威。这是举行反对“安全条约”运动以来最大的一次示威。
    下午两点钟左右，国会附近开始挤满了工人、学生、农民、知识分子和市民。他们聚集在国会周围的街道上，并且高呼“打倒岸内阁”和“反对‘安全条约’”等口号。四点钟，来自各地的示威群众相继在国会前面会师。
    今天参加示威的群众中，包括着空前广泛的社会阶层。茨城、新潟、长野等各县的农民都在农忙的季节中停止了田间工作，赶到东京来参加反美爱国斗争。京都的代表团是由一百名商人——京都工商业者团体联合会会员组成的，他们举着的横幅标语上写着：“不要来，艾克！哈格蒂，滚出去！”
    许多家庭妇女和儿童出现在今天的示威行列中。东京小石川区的三百名家庭妇女在国会附近挥舞着小旗示威；许多家庭妇女牵着自己的孩子游行。
    示威群众拿着写有鲜明反美口号的旗子。旗上用英文字印着“艾克和U—2，别到日本来”。
    岸信介政府慑于人民的斗争威力，竟在国会周围敷设了铁丝网，并且在国会场地内用许多警察的铁甲车来“设防”。
    在国会前举行示威的同时，几批示威队伍开始从国会附近开往由日本警察严加守卫的美国大使馆。人们在那里激愤地高呼“艾克，别来”和“美国兵士滚回去”等口号。
    一支由学生组成的示威大军在晚六点左右包围了岸信介私人住宅。他们是为了阻止哈格蒂前往岸信介住宅进行会谈而在那里进行静坐斗争的。当获悉哈格蒂已经偷偷地从东京溜走的消息时，从示威队伍里发出了胜利的笑声。
    大阪、神户、名古屋等地的大示威和奋起大会，也在有力地震撼着岸信介内阁。消息说，大阪市今天有十万人举行了示威游行。
    新华社11日讯　东京消息：日本人民反对新日美“安全条约”第十八次全国统一行动今天开始。
    这次统一行动的先锋部队——从全国四十六个都道府县赶来的由工人、农民和市民代表组成的示威队伍，今天上午九时左右高呼反美反岸口号分四路浩浩荡荡进入东京。同时，有大批示威者从各地乘火车来到东京。据日本工会总评议会今天下午宣布，这些示威者的人数已达到七万五千人。
    大示威是以包围国会、美国大使馆和岸信介首相官邸为目标而展开的。在每一批示威队伍的最前列，都高举着巨幅标语：“我们反对批准经过修改的美日‘安全条约’。农民代表举着的草席标语牌特别引人注意，草席标语牌上面写着：打倒岸信介内阁！立即解散国会！艾森豪威尔不要前来日本！
    各地示威代表今天下午先在东京日比谷露天音乐堂集合，然后排队前往国会大厦前面参加由阻止修改“安全条约”国民会议领导的二十万人大示威。
    国民会议代表、社会党国会议员井冈大治在这支声势浩大的游行队伍出发之前向全体队员讲话。他强调指出，艾森豪威尔访日目的是要为摇摇欲坠的岸信介内阁撑腰，以促进批准新“安全条约”。他说，岸信介企图借助外国力量来解决问题，这就是目前日本形势严重的根源所在。
    他接着指责艾森豪威尔在破坏四国首脑会谈后又阴谋通过这次对菲律宾、台湾、南朝鲜和日本的访问，加强它在亚洲的侵略军事同盟。
    井冈强调说，爱好和平的日本人民绝对不容许具有这种目的的艾森豪威尔访日。今天我们要以二十万群众的力量包围国会、首相官邸和美国大使馆，表达强烈的抗议。
    来自各地的示威代表向新闻界叙述了他们的斗争情况。
    来自石川县的代表山花义太郎说，在反对新“安全条约”的运动中，石川县的农民正在迅速行动起来，同工人一道进行反美反岸斗争。他说，“这主要归功于工人在农村地区的积极活动，他们帮助我们举行反对‘安全条约’的群众大会，使反对‘安全条约’的宣传深入到农民中去”。
    群马县的示威领队人河崎清松说，“在群马县，运动已经开始扩大到商人，更不必说农民了，大部分农民都很积极地参加运动。”河崎清松强调指出，即使岸信介强迫众议院强行通过新“安全条约”，群马人民也将拒绝这个条约。现在，我们正在竭尽全力准备总罢工，反对岸信介强迫参议院通过这个条约。
    据新华社10日讯　东京消息：从5月31日开始的日本人民反对新日美“安全条约”第十七次全国统一行动今天胜利结束。十一天来，英雄的日本人民对他们的两个主要敌人——美帝国主义和岸信介集团展开了比以前声势更大、更加猛烈的斗争，并且取得了辉煌的成就。
    阻止修改“安全条约”国民会议事务局长水口宏三在谈到这次全国统一行动的特点时指出：首先是工人阶级胜利地举行了史无前例的六·四政治总罢工；其次是各阶层人民都行动起来参加这一斗争；第三是通过这次斗争使反对艾森豪威尔访日的活动成为全民性的政治斗争。
    6月4日总罢工是这次统一行动的重要组成部分，也是这次统一行动的重大胜利的鲜明标志。五百六十万工人不顾岸信介政府的镇压和破坏，在全国各地各企业部门举行罢工；农民、学生、妇女、教授、科学家、宗教家、法学家、诗人、演员等都从3日晚上开始通宵和工人在一起展开斗争；三万家商店举行了罢市；一般市民，也投入了火热的战斗。他们的职业和信仰虽然不同，但是异口同声地喊出了反对日美军事同盟条约、反对艾森豪威尔访问日本、要求美军撤走“U—2”型间谍飞机和打倒卖国的岸信介内阁等反美口号。这表明，日本人民的反美爱国统一战线经过六·四总罢工正在迅速扩大，反美斗争有了新的发展。
    在第十七次全国统一行动中，日本广大人民愈战愈强。工人举行罢工斗争，各界人民每天不断地向美国大使馆和国会的抗议示威，两千多万人签名要求岸信介下台和解散国会，他们把各种方式的斗争汇集成为一股洪流，猛烈地冲击着岸信介内阁的基础，并且怀着对胜利的坚定信心表示，反美反岸斗争不取得最后胜利绝不罢休。（附图片）
