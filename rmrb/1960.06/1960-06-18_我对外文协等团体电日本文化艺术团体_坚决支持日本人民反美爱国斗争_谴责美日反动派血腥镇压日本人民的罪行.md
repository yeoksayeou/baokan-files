Xinhua News Agency, 17th. The Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Chinese Writers Association, Chinese Theatre Association, Chinese Musicians Association, Chinese Dance Research Association, and the China Photographic Society, on the 16th, sent cables to Japanese cultural and artistic organizations, condemning the heinous crimes of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries in bloodily suppressing the Japanese people, expressing their firm support for the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic just struggle.

The Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, in a cable sent to the Japan-China Friendship Association, the National Council Against Revision of the Security Treaty, and forwarded to various Japanese student groups, stated that the atrocities committed by the Nobusuke Kishi traitorous clique to "protect" their American master Eisenhower's visit to Japan will not intimidate the heroic Japanese people. When one person falls, ten thousand stand up. Such atrocities by the Kishi Nobusuke clique have made the flames of anger of the Japanese people burn even more fiercely and violently. In this raging fire, the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries have completely exposed their ugly faces and schemes to deceive the people. The Japanese people will surely defeat the new conspiracies of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries.

The China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, in a cable sent to the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, the National Council Against Revision of the Security Treaty, and forwarded to the "Anti-U.S.-Japan Security Treaty Critique Society," stated that the Nobusuke Kishi government's assignment of police and thugs to create a massive massacre of students is an outrageous crime that makes people's hair stand on end, and we express our utmost anger. We express our deep condolences for the heroic sacrifices of the Japanese patriotic martyrs, and we express our sincere sympathy to the injured patriotic students and the families of the deceased. We hope you will turn grief into strength and demand a blood debt from the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries.

The Chinese Writers Association, in a cable sent to the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, the National Council Against Revision of the Security Treaty, and forwarded to all Japanese students, stated that Nobusuke Kishi, who sells out his country for personal gain, in order to please his American master and welcome the war-monger Eisenhower's visit to Japan, dares to suppress the Japanese people's thunderous anti-American patriotic struggle with barbaric fascist means, slaughtering passionate patriotic students, and we express our utmost indignation at this. For the common and vital interests of the people of China and Japan, and for the peace of Asia, Chinese writers will, from beginning to end, support the heroic Japanese people with all their heart and soul.

The Chinese Theatre Association, in a cable sent to the Japan Theatre Association and forwarded to all Japanese theatre workers, stated that the atrocities of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries only prove the strength of the Japanese people's struggle against the "Security Treaty," and demonstrate the fragility of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries; this is their death throes, and they will never be able to intimidate the spirited Japanese people. We firmly believe that the patriotic and just struggle of Japanese theatre workers and the Japanese people will surely achieve final victory. Chinese theatre workers resolutely stand behind you and fully support your just struggle.

The Chinese Musicians Association, in a cable sent to the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association and forwarded to the Democratic Musicians' Association, stated that we express our deep condolences for the students who gloriously sacrificed in the anti-American patriotic just struggle, and extend our deepest sympathy to the injured students. Opposing the aggression and war policies of U.S. imperialism and opposing the revival of Japanese militarism by U.S. imperialism is the common task of the people of China and Japan. For the interests of our two peoples, for the defense of peace in Asia and the world, we Chinese music workers and all the Chinese people will always be with you, resolutely supporting your struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dog, the Nobusuke Kishi clique.

The Chinese Dance Research Association, in a cable sent to the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, the National Council Against Revision of the Security Treaty, and forwarded to the Japanese students, stated that we express our warmest support for the heroic counterattack by Tokyo students on June 15 against the bloody suppression by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, express our warmest sympathy to the students injured in the struggle and their families, and express our condolences to the students who gloriously sacrificed in the struggle. We firmly believe that the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle against U.S. imperialism and against Nobusuke Kishi will surely achieve final victory.

The Chinese Photographic Society, in a cable sent to the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association and forwarded to the Japan Photographers Association and all Japanese photographers, stated that the Nobusuke Kishi reactionary government's massacre atrocities against the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle have aroused great indignation among the Chinese people. Chinese photographers express their condolences to the injured students and masses, express their condolences to the heroic martyrs, and express their deep sympathy and condolences to their families. We resolutely support the Japanese people's anti-American and anti-Nobusuke Kishi patriotic and just struggle.
