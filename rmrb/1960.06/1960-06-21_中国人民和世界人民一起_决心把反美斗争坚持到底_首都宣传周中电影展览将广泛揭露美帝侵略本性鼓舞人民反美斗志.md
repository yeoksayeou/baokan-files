Xinhua News Agency, 20th. The opening ceremony of the film exhibition in the capital during the propaganda week against U.S. Imperialism, resolutely liberating Taiwan, and defending world peace, was held tonight. Liu Ningyi, Qian Junrui, Luo Guibo, Liu Changsheng, Bao Erhan, Shi Liang, Li Dequan, Yang Hansheng, Wang Kunlun, Shu Sheyu, Cai Chusheng and others attended the opening ceremony.

More than 1,400 people from all walks of life in Beijing attended the opening ceremony.

Foreign guests attending the opening ceremony included diplomatic envoys and officials from various countries stationed in China, as well as peace advocates from various countries in Beijing.

Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of Culture, delivered the opening speech. He said: U.S. imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people, the mortal enemy of the people of all Asian countries, and the mortal enemy of the people of the whole world. The number one representative of U.S. imperialism, the "plague god" Eisenhower, is now making his unlucky robber trip in the Western Pacific. In five days, June 25, will be the tenth anniversary of U.S. imperialism's armed attack on Korea. In seven days, June 27, will be the tenth anniversary of U.S. imperialism's armed occupation of China's sacred territory, Taiwan. For more than ten years, U.S. imperialism has done all kinds of bad things and said all kinds of nice things to the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America and the world, including the American people. The people of the whole world have truly suffered enough from it. From their own painful experiences, the people of all countries have gradually recognized the predatory nature of U.S. imperialism and seen through its wolfish true colors. Now it is in unprecedented isolation in the face of the people of the world, and it is already in the midst of the righteous encirclement of the people of the world. Now the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is unprecedentedly strong; the struggle for peace, independence, democracy and socialism in Asia, Africa, Latin America and other parts of the world is also unprecedentedly strong; and imperialism and all reactionaries are nothing but paper tigers, and their lifespan will certainly not be very long. As long as the people of the world unite closely, form a broad united front, and resolutely carry out the struggle, we can stop U.S. imperialism's aggression, defend world peace, and achieve complete victory in the struggle.

Qian Junrui said that our film week will screen several feature films and short films, which reflect part of the struggle of the Chinese people and the people of all countries in the world against U.S. imperialism. Reviewing this ten-year history is of great benefit to us in further recognizing the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism and further inspiring our fighting spirit against U.S. imperialism.

Liu Ningyi, representative of various people's organizations and chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, spoke at the meeting. He said that the head of U.S. imperialism, the "plague god" Eisenhower, actually set foot on our territory, Taiwan, on June 18. This robber trip has aroused the infinite anger of the people of our country. Liu Ningyi pointed out that the nature of imperialism's aggression and plunder will never change. In order to save its dying fate, U.S. imperialism is further expanding its arms race and stepping up its enslavement of its own and other countries' people. Now U.S. imperialism has fallen into unprecedented isolation in the face of the peace-loving people of the world. Its reputation is getting worse and worse, and it is like a rat running across the street, with everyone shouting to beat it. Wherever Eisenhower, this "plague god," announced he would "visit," a storm of struggle against U.S. imperialism has been set off. The heroic Japanese people have already forced Eisenhower to postpone his plan to "visit" Japan with a nationwide, massive, and increasingly resolute struggle.

Liu Ningyi said that although the United States instructed the South Korean traitorous clique to carry out bloody massacres and suppression of the South Korean people, Syngman Rhee was still driven off the stage by the South Korean people. Liu Ningyi emphasized that the patriotic and just struggle of the South Korean people has not only received the strong support and solidarity of the people in northern Korea, but also the active support of the 650 million Chinese people and the people of all countries in the world. The just struggle of the Korean people for the peaceful reunification of their motherland will surely achieve final victory.

Liu Ningyi emphasized that the purpose of U.S. imperialism's head Eisenhower's "visit" to Taiwan this time is clearly to step up the realization of the "two Chinas" and the conspiracy to permanently occupy our Taiwan, attempting to turn Taiwan into a springboard for launching a new war of aggression. This is another intolerable provocative act against our 650 million Chinese people. In order to express the great Chinese people's contempt and disdain for Eisenhower, and in order to support the just struggle of the people of Asian countries against Eisenhower's robber trip, we resolutely and fully support the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front in its armed demonstration against U.S. imperialism. He said that we must unite with the Asian people and the people of the world to form a broad anti-American united front and carry the struggle against U.S. imperialism to the end.

Liu Ningyi emphasized that now, the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly powerful, the national democratic movement in Asia, Africa, and Latin America is surging forward, and the struggle of the people of all countries in the world against imperialist wars of aggression and in defense of peace is rising to an unprecedented level. We firmly believe that our struggle, the struggle of the people of the whole world, will surely be victorious.

After the meeting, the documentary "Asian Storm" and the feature film "Shangganling" were shown. "Asian Storm" recorded the great scenes of the anti-American struggle of the people of Asian countries in full swing, and at the same time exposed the true face of U.S. imperialism's false peace, true arms buildup, false detente, and true aggression.

    中国人民和世界人民一起  决心把反美斗争坚持到底
    首都宣传周中电影展览将广泛揭露美帝侵略本性鼓舞人民反美斗志
    新华社20日讯　反对美帝侵略、坚决解放台湾、保卫世界和平宣传周首都电影展览今晚举行开幕式。刘宁一、钱俊瑞、罗贵波、刘长胜、包尔汉、史良、李德全、阳翰笙、王昆仑、舒舍予、蔡楚生等出席了开幕式。
    出席开幕式的有北京各界人士一千四百多人。
    出席开幕式的外宾，有各国驻华使节和外交官员以及在京的各国和平人士。
    文化部副部长钱俊瑞致开幕词。他说：美帝国主义是中国人民的死敌，是亚洲各国人民的死敌，是全世界人民的死敌。美帝国主义的头号代表、“瘟神”艾森豪威尔现在正在西太平洋作他的倒霉的强盗旅行。再过五天，6月25日，就是美帝国主义发动武装进攻朝鲜的十周年。再过七天，6月27日，又是美帝国主义武装侵占我国神圣领土台湾的十周年。十多年来，美帝国主义对亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和世界各国人民、包括美国人民在内，做尽了一切坏事，也说尽了一切好话。全世界人民真正吃尽了它的苦头。各国人民从自身的苦痛经历中，逐渐认清美帝国主义的强盗本质，看穿了它的豺狼真相。现在它在全世界人民面前已经陷于空前的孤立，它已经处于全世界人民的正义的包围之中。现在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营空前壮大；亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和世界其他地方的争取和平、独立、民主和社会主义的斗争也是空前强大；而帝国主义和一切反动派都只不过是纸老虎，他的寿命肯定不会很长了。全世界人民只要紧密地团结起来，结成广泛的统一战线，坚决进行斗争，我们就能阻止美帝国主义的侵略，保卫世界和平，取得斗争的完全胜利。
    钱俊瑞说，我们这个电影周将放映几部长片和短片，它们反映了中国人民和世界各国人民反对美帝国主义的斗争的一部分。重温这十年的历史，对于我们进一步认清美帝国主义侵略的本性，进一步鼓舞我们反对美帝国主义的斗志，是有极大的好处的。
    各人民团体代表、中华全国总工会主席刘宁一在会上讲话。他说，美帝国主义的头子“瘟神”艾森豪威尔在6月18日竟然踏上我国领土台湾，他这次强盗旅行，激起了我全国人民无比的愤怒。刘宁一指出，帝国主义的侵略和掠夺本质是永远不会改变的。美帝国主义为了挽救它垂死的命运，正在进一步扩军备战，加紧奴役本国和别国人民。现在美帝国主义在全世界爱好和平人民的面前已经陷于空前孤立的境地，它的名声越来越臭，活像一只过街的老鼠，人人喊打。艾森豪威尔这个“瘟神”宣布要“访问”的地方，到处掀起了反对美帝国主义的斗争风暴。英勇的日本人民已经用举国一致、声势浩大、一浪高过一浪的坚决斗争，迫使艾森豪威尔不得不推迟“访问”日本的计划。
    刘宁一说，尽管美国指使南朝鲜卖国集团对南朝鲜人民实行血腥屠杀和镇压，李承晚还是被南朝鲜人民赶下了台。刘宁一强调指出，南朝鲜人民的爱国正义斗争，不仅受到朝鲜北部人民的有力支持和声援，而且还受到六亿五千万中国人民和世界各国人民的积极支援。朝鲜人民的和平统一祖国的正义斗争，一定能够得到最后的胜利。
    刘宁一强调指出，这一次美帝国主义头子艾森豪威尔“访问”台湾的目的，很明显是想加紧实现“两个中国”和永久霸占我国台湾的阴谋，企图把台湾变成它发动新的侵略战争的跳板。这是对我国六亿五千万中国人民又一次不可容忍的挑衅行为。为了表示伟大的中国人民对艾森豪威尔的蔑视和鄙视，为了支持亚洲各国人民反对艾森豪威尔强盗旅行的正义斗争，我们坚决地、全力地支持福建前线人民解放军对美帝国主义的武装示威。他说，我们要和亚洲人民一起，和全世界人民在一起，结成广泛的反美统一战线，把反对美帝国主义的斗争坚持到底。
    刘宁一强调指出，现在，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营日益强大，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族民主运动风起云涌，全世界各国人民反对帝国主义侵略战争、保卫和平的斗争空前高涨。我们坚决相信，我们的斗争，全世界人民的斗争，一定胜利。
    会后放映了纪录片“亚洲风暴”和故事片“上甘岭”。“亚洲风暴”纪录了亚洲各国人民如火如荼的反美斗争的伟大场面，同时揭露了美帝国主义的假和平、真备战，假和缓、真侵略的本来面目。（附图片）
