Xinhua News Agency, 8th. Park Sang-hong, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Federation of Trade Unions, stated at the 11th Council meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions on the afternoon of the 7th that U.S. imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Korean people. The South Korean people, through their heroic resistance struggle, have opened a huge gap in the aggressive policy of U.S. imperialism. This is a victory for the Korean people and also a victory for all anti-imperialist people.

Park Sang-hong said that at present, the struggle of the people of all countries against imperialist aggression is like a raging tide. In every corner of the world, in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, one wave rises after another, magnificent and sweeping, everywhere striking down imperialist aggressors and their running dogs. On the other hand, the imperialists, incorrigible by nature, are more blatantly preparing to launch new wars and stepping up aggression against other countries. It dispatched military reconnaissance planes to invade Soviet airspace and sabotaged the summit conference, thereby once again exposing the bandit nature of U.S. imperialism in front of the people of the world, and further clearly proving that Eisenhower is a number one war-monger.

Park Sang-hong listed a series of facts such as U.S. imperialism actively reviving Japanese militarism, occupying China's territory of Taiwan, instructing the South Vietnamese puppets to obstruct Vietnam's reunification, interfering in the Cuban people's revolution, and colluding with French imperialism in a conspiracy to suppress the Algerian people's national liberation struggle, pointing out that U.S. imperialism is the most aggressive and most ferocious imperialism. He said that the Korean Federation of Trade Unions firmly supports the struggles of the people of Japan, Cuba, and Algeria.

Park Sang-hong pointed out that what U.S. imperialism says about "peace" and "negotiation" is actually just wearing a mask to pursue a policy of war and aggression. A wolf cannot become a gentle sheep. U.S. imperialists, since their birth, have lived by plunder and aggression, and as long as they exist on this earth, they will do such dirty deeds.

He said that the truth about the aggression of U.S. imperialism has also been thoroughly exposed in Korea, and the people's anger and hatred are erupting like a volcano.

South Korean workers and people have been holding heroic uprisings against the fascist terror rule of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs for three months. The uprising has proved and is proving that as long as the people launch struggles to fight for freedom and the right to survival, no matter who you are, you cannot stop their struggle.

He said that although the Syngman Rhee gang has been overthrown, the fruits of the workers' and people's bloody struggle have not fallen into their own hands.

Standing at the crossroads of life and death, the South Korean people, although embarking on the road of solving their own destiny, U.S. imperialism has instructed the Syngman Rhee gang to organize a massacre of the people, and under the guise of "transferring command," dispatched troops under its command to directly carry out bloody suppression. Therefore, the blood of innocent people is now staining the land of South Korea red.

U.S. imperialism is also playing cunning tricks to deceive the people, creating a so-called "caretaker cabinet" and clamoring for some kind of "reform." However, this "caretaker cabinet" is nothing more than a continuation of the Syngman Rhee regime, which was originally pieced together by U.S. imperialist running dogs.

Park Sang-hong said that the Korean working class and the people of the whole country will never forgive the new crimes of U.S. imperialism.

He said that the struggle of the South Korean workers and people has entered a new stage. Recently, large-scale demonstrations and struggles of workers and people have broken out again in various regions of South Korea, such as Seoul, Daegu, and Jeonju.

He said that as long as the U.S. imperialist colonial system exists, as long as the anti-people fascist rule continues, the struggle of the workers and the masses will continue.

This uprising is an explosion of the anger accumulated in the hearts of the South Korean workers and people during the fifteen years of fascist rule by U.S. imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique.

The fifteen years of U.S. imperialism's occupation of South Korea are full of records of colonial plunder, enslaving exploitation, and brutal strangulation of freedom and democracy, full of heinous criminal records of murder.

Under the guise of "aid," U.S. imperialism has pursued a colonial plunder policy, resulting in South Korea becoming a commodity dumping market and raw material supply base for the United States. The national economy has been completely bankrupted.

He said that U.S. imperialism is not only an aggressor, a plunderer, and an enemy, but also a heinous war criminal. It attempts to forever divide our country and isolate our nation. It is the mortal enemy of our nation, with whom we cannot live under the same sky. When the flames of war ceased in our country, the whole world hoped that the tragedy of the Korean War would not be repeated, and hoped for the peaceful reunification of Korea. However, U.S. imperialism has trampled on all these wishes.

U.S. imperialism is answering the Korean people's efforts to peacefully resolve the Korean issue by preparing to launch a new war. U.S. imperialism occupying South Korea - this is the root cause of all the disasters suffered by the Korean people.

Park Sang-hong said that if U.S. imperialism gets out and stops pursuing its aggressive policy, the South Korean workers and people would not live in such dire straits today, and Korea would be unified by the Korean people themselves and develop into a strong and unified country with a solid economic foundation, regardless of North and South. The changes that have taken place in the northern half of the Republic prove this.

From liberation to today, for fifteen years, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, the socialist system that thousands of working people have longed for and fought for has been firmly established in the northern half. At present, the flag of the Republic has become a symbol of the freedom and happiness of the Korean people.

Park Sang-hong emphasized that the masters of Korea are the Korean people, and the fate of Korea must be decided by the Korean people themselves. This is the national right of the Korean people, which does not allow anyone to infringe upon it, and does not allow U.S. imperialism to interfere. U.S. imperialism must put away its atomic and rocket weapons and immediately withdraw from South Korea.

Park Sang-hong said that the struggle to force the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea is also a struggle to safeguard peace. I hope that our just call to condemn the U.S. military's occupation of South Korea and demand their withdrawal will merge with the more majestic voices of the working class around the world.

He said that the upcoming June 25th is the tenth anniversary of the day U.S. imperialism launched a bloody war in Korea. Therefore, I suggest to this meeting: establish an International Solidarity Week to support the just struggle of the Korean working class and people demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea.

Park Sang-hong emphasized that imperialism is the enemy of the working class and all mankind in the world, and the enemy of peace and national independence. Without eliminating imperialism, the working class cannot improve its social status and economic situation; without crushing the imperialist war policy, there can be no hope for peace; without driving away the imperialist aggressor forces, national independence and freedom cannot be obtained. He said that U.S. imperialism must be forced to withdraw from South Korea, forced to get out of Japan, Taiwan, and South Vietnam, and driven out of all regions of Asia and Africa. This is a common task facing the working class and trade unions in this region, and it must be made a cause closely related to the working class around the world.

### 美帝国主义永远靠掠夺和侵略过日子

    朝鲜职业总同盟中央委员会副委员长朴尚弘发言指出
    美帝国主义永远靠掠夺和侵略过日子
    不消灭帝国主义，工人阶级就不能改善自己的地位
    不粉碎帝国主义的战争政策，就不可能期望有和平
    不赶走帝国主义侵略势力，就不可能获得独立自由
    新华社8日讯　朝鲜职业总同盟中央委员会副委员长朴尚弘7日下午在世界工联第十一次理事会会议上说，美帝国主义是朝鲜民族的死敌。南朝鲜人民通过英勇的反抗斗争，给美帝国主义的侵略政策打开了一个巨大的缺口，这是朝鲜人民的胜利，同时也是所有反帝国主义的人民的胜利。
    朴尚弘说，目前，各国人民反对帝国主义侵略的斗争，势如怒涛，在全世界的每一个角落，在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲，此起彼伏、波澜壮阔，到处都在打倒帝国主义侵略者和它们的走狗。另一方面，帝国主义者们本性难移，更加露骨地准备发动新战争，加紧对别国进行侵略。它派遣军事侦察机侵犯了苏联领空，破坏了最高级会议，从而在全世界人民面前再一次暴露了美帝国主义的强盗本性，进一步清楚地证明了艾森豪威尔是头号战争贩子。
    朴尚弘列举美帝国主义积极复活日本军国主义，霸占中国领土台湾，指使南越傀儡阻挠越南统一、干涉古巴人民革命、伙同法帝国主义阴谋镇压阿尔及利亚人民的民族解放斗争等一系列事实，指出美帝国主义是最富有侵略性、最凶恶的帝国主义。他表示，朝鲜职业总同盟坚决支持日本、古巴和阿尔及利亚人民的斗争。
    朴尚弘指出，美帝国主义嘴里讲什么“和平”和“谈判”，实际上却不过是戴着假面具奉行战争和侵略政策。狼不可能变成温和的羊。美帝国主义者自从它出世以来，就靠掠夺和侵略过日子，而且今后它在地球上存在一天，就会干一天这种勾当。
    他说，美帝国主义者的侵略真相，在朝鲜也彻底暴露出来，人民的愤怒和憎恨有如火山爆发。
    南朝鲜工人和人民举行英勇起义，反对美帝国主义及其走狗的法西斯恐怖统治，已经持续了三个月。起义证明了并且正在证明：只要是人民掀起斗争，争取自由和生存权利，那么任你是谁，也阻挡不住他们的斗争。
    他说，李承晚匪帮虽然被打倒了，但是工人和人民流血斗争的果实，并没有落到他们自己的手里。
    站在生和死这两岔路口上的南朝鲜人民，虽然走上了自己解决自己命运的道路，美帝国主义却指使李承晚匪帮，组织了对人民的大屠杀，在“移交指挥权”的名目下，出动受它指挥的军队，直接进行流血镇压。因此，现在无辜人民的鲜血染红了南朝鲜的土地。
    美帝国主义还玩弄狡猾的伎俩欺骗人民，制造了所谓“看守内阁”，叫嚣要搞什么“改革”。但是，这个“看守内阁”不是别的，而是原先由美帝国主义走狗拼凑起来的李承晚政权的延续。
    朴尚弘说，朝鲜工人阶级和全国人民一道，决不饶恕美帝国主义的新罪行。
    他说，目前南朝鲜工人和人民的斗争进入了新阶段。最近汉城、大丘、全州等南朝鲜各个地区重又爆发了工人和人民的大规模示威斗争。
    他说，只要是美帝国主义殖民制度还存在，只要是反人民的法西斯统治还在继续，工人和人民群众的斗争就会持续下去。
    这次起义是南朝鲜工人和人民在美帝国主义和李承晚集团法西斯统治的十五年中积压在心坎中的愤怒的爆发。
    美帝国主义侵占南朝鲜的十五年，充满了殖民地掠夺、奴役性榨取和残暴绞杀自由和民主的记录，充满了令人发指的罪恶的杀人记录。
    美帝国主义在“援助”的幌子下，奉行殖民地掠夺政策，结果使南朝鲜沦为美国的商品倾销市场和原料供应地。民族经济业已完全破产。
    他说，美帝国主义不仅是侵略者、掠夺者、敌人，而且是凶恶的战争罪犯。它企图永远使我国国土分裂、民族隔绝。它是我们民族不共戴天的死敌。当战争的炮火在我国停息的时候，全世界都希望朝鲜战争的惨祸不再重演，期望朝鲜和平统一。但是，美帝国主义竟然践踏了这一切愿望。
    美帝国主义正用准备发动新战争来回答朝鲜人民争取和平解决朝鲜问题的努力。美帝国主义霸占南朝鲜——这是朝鲜人民所遭受的一切灾难的祸根。
    朴尚弘说，如果美帝国主义滚出去，停止奉行它的侵略政策，南朝鲜工人和人民就不会生活在今天这种水深火热之中，而朝鲜也就会由朝鲜人民自己统一起来，发展成为一个不分南北、具有稳固经济基础的富强的统一国家。共和国北半部所发生的变化，证明了这一点。
    从解放到今天，十五年来，在朝鲜劳动党领导下，北半部已经牢固地建立了千千万万劳动人民所渴望并为之而奋斗的社会主义制度。目前，共和国的旗帜已经成为朝鲜人民自由和幸福的象征。
    朴尚弘强调，朝鲜的主人是朝鲜人，朝鲜的命运必须由朝鲜人民自己来决定。这是朝鲜人民的民族权利，不容许任何人侵犯，不许美帝国主义干涉。美帝国主义必须收起它的原子和火箭武器，立即撤出南朝鲜。
    朴尚弘说，迫使美军撤出南朝鲜的斗争，也就是维护和平的斗争。我期望我们痛斥美军霸占南朝鲜、要求它们撤走的正义呼声，将同全世界工人阶级更雄壮的呼声汇合在一起。
    他说，即将到来的6月25日，是十年前美帝国主义在朝鲜发动流血战争的日子。因此，我向这次会议建议：设立支援朝鲜工人阶级和人民要求美军撤出南朝鲜正义斗争国际团结周。
    朴尚弘强调指出，帝国主义是全世界工人阶级和全人类的敌人，是和平和民族的独立的敌人。不消灭帝国主义，工人阶级就不能改善自己的社会地位和经济情况；不粉碎帝国主义的战争政策，就不可能期望有和平；不赶走帝国主义侵略势力，就不可能获得民族独立和自由。他说，必须迫使美帝国主义撤出南朝鲜，迫使它滚出日本、台湾和南越，把它赶出亚非一切地区。这是摆在这一地区工人阶级和工会面前的共同任务，必须使之成为与全世界工人阶级息息相关的事业。
