(Dispatch from Lanzhou, June 10th) Nearly 100,000 cadres in Gansu Province are enthusiastically responding to the call of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to overcome the general approach to leadership. They are going to the forefront of production to strengthen leadership over weak links, promote balanced development in various regions, and comprehensively leap forward in all tasks.

Gansu's rural situation this year is excellent, and agricultural production in all aspects has taken another leap forward compared to last year. However, there are still a few production teams lagging behind, and their completion of various tasks is also relatively poor. In response to this situation, the Provincial Party Committee specifically convened a telephone conference on May 10, requiring all localities to grasp weak links and strengthen leadership over backward teams. At the same time, it issued instructions on analyzing specific problems and overcoming the generalized leadership style. Cadres throughout the province responded to the call of the Provincial Party Committee, and in mid-May, provincial-level agencies transferred a total of 1,400 cadres to strengthen the forefront of production. More than 90,000 leading cadres at all levels from various special districts, counties, cities, and communes were transferred to reinforce the forefront. In strengthening leadership at the forefront of production, current efforts are particularly focused on strengthening leadership over weak areas.

After this group of cadres went to the countryside, many regions have achieved the following: leading cadres personally grasp all important links, key issues, and various measures to increase production. Their current main tasks are to launch a crash program of drought resistance planting, plant more and more, and strive to comprehensively overfulfill the state's planting plan in all regions and for all crops, laying the foundation for greater harvests. In areas where winter wheat ripens early, they are also simultaneously grasping the preparations for summer harvesting and planting.

After this group of cadres went to the forefront of production, they have adopted the method of conducting specific analysis of specific problems in their work, generally implementing the practice of eating, living, and working with the masses, consulting with the masses on everything, overcoming difficulties with the masses, and taking effective measures to solve problems based on the existing problems in their respective regions. The measures taken for the majority of backward teams are: strengthening socialist education, raising the ideological awareness of cadres and the masses, improving the leadership core, and adhering to the principle of putting politics in command; publicizing and implementing the Party's policies, mobilizing the masses to vigorously improve production; doing a good job in the management of communes, helping to improve public canteens, etc. The Wangtuan Production Team of the Tianshui People's Commune in Tianshui City was originally lagging behind in production. When the secretary of the Commune Party Committee came here, he conducted in-depth investigation and research among the masses and found that the main reason for the slow pace of work was the backwardness of the leadership. He patiently helped the branch secretary to raise his ideological awareness, improve his leadership style, rationally arrange farm work, and solve the problem of insufficient animal power, which significantly accelerated the planting progress. They also adopted the method of advanced teams leading backward teams, convening on-site meetings to promote the rapid catching up of backward teams with advanced teams. In the originally backward Siba Production Team of Pingchuan Commune in Gaotai County, the secretary of the Commune Party Committee found that the planting progress was slow, so he organized labor to go to the forefront of production, took off his shoes and went into the fields, and worked with more than 100 cadres to cultivate 18 mu of rice stubble land, which motivated the vast number of commune members, and rushed to plant more than 530 mu of cotton in four days.

After the vast number of cadres went to the forefront of production, a leap forward situation quickly emerged in the rural areas of the province. According to statistics on May 30, the daily planting progress of the province significantly accelerated compared to the end of April. The Tianshui Special District planted 100,000 mu per day, an increase of 80% compared to the beginning of the month.

(Dispatch from Changsha, June 10th) The Guiyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the increasingly hot weather and the tense agricultural work situation, has comprehensively arranged the summer life of the masses to ensure that commune members eat well, sleep well, and rest well, so that commune members have full energy and vigorous labor enthusiasm, which vigorously promotes the summer production movement.

The Guiyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has always attached great importance to the arrangement of the masses' lives in various periods and has always regarded grasping the masses' lives as a major measure to complete various production tasks. From the end of April to mid-May, the County Party Committee has successively studied and deployed the issue of summer life through two meetings.

Further improving public canteens so that commune members can eat their fill and eat well is a major event in the summer life arrangement. The County Party Committee comprehensively rectified all 5,230 canteens in the county, carried out inspections and evaluations, and further launched the "Five-Good" canteen competition movement. In terms of food arrangement, in the spirit of planned food consumption and economical food consumption, it further clarified the entire food base and specifically arranged the food consumption plan for the 50 days or so before the early rice harvest. While arranging canteens, it vigorously grasped vegetable production. By mobilizing the masses and making full use of open spaces, the county expanded the planting of summer vegetables by more than 30,000 mu, ensuring that each person could eat more than two catties of vegetables per day.

In addition to grasping food, the County Party Committee appropriately arranged the labor and rest time of the masses according to the long days and short nights in summer, so that they could have both work and rest and combine work with rest. The County Party Committee stipulated that each commune member should be guaranteed eight hours of sleep and four hours of eating and rest time. In order to ensure good sleep and rest, three measures were taken: (1) Vigorously carry out tool reform and universally promote new-style tools. Fifteen kinds of new-style advanced tools are used throughout the county, and labor efficiency is significantly improved. (2) Implement the "Four-Fixed" system, that is, fixed time to stop work, fixed time to start work, fixed time to eat, and fixed time to sleep. (3) Appropriately control the time for evening meetings and carry out cultural and recreational activities. Cultural stations and amateur art troupes have been established in every brigade throughout the county, and small concerts are held in the evening or during rest time to enliven the cultural life of the commune members.

The summer patriotic health movement was continued to protect the health of commune members. Bathhouses have been built in every canteen by using local materials.

Production teams arranged labor to help commune members repair more than 1,000 leaky houses. A portion of cash was pre-distributed to commune members to purchase daily necessities for the summer.

Because the whole region carried out the "Four-Good" movement and the Party's meticulous concern for the lives of the masses, and the summer life of the masses was arranged early, the commune members were all in a happy mood and full of energy, and their labor enthusiasm was even higher, which vigorously promoted the current production.

    突击抗旱播种　多种再多种　全面完成计划
    甘肃十万干部深入基层抓薄弱环节
    湖南桂阳全面安排生活保证社员吃好睡好有劳有逸
    本报兰州10日电　甘肃省近十万名干部热烈响应中共甘肃省委对于克服一般化领导作风的号召，走上生产第一线，加强对薄弱环节的领导，促使各类地区平衡发展，各项工作全面跃进。
    甘肃今年农村形势极好，农业生产各方面都比去年又跃进了一步。但是仍有少数生产队落在后面，各项任务完成的也都比较差。省委针对这一情况，在5月10日专门召开电话会议，要求各地抓薄弱环节，加强落后队的领导。同时，发出了具体问题具体分析、克服一般化领导作风的指示。全省干部纷纷响应省委号召，在5月中旬，省级机关共抽调了一千四百名干部，加强生产第一线。各专区和县、市、公社抽调出来充实第一线的各级领导干部在九万人以上。在加强生产第一线的领导中，当前又特别加强了对薄弱地区的领导。
    这批干部下到农村后，许多地区都已经做到：所有重要环节、关键问题和各项增产措施都有领导干部亲自抓。他们当前的主要任务是突击抗旱播种，多种更多种，力争各个地区、各种作物全面超额完成国家播种计划，为多收打下基础。在冬麦早熟地区，还同时抓紧进行夏收夏种的准备工作。
    这批干部走上生产第一线以后，在工作方法上做到了对具体问题作具体分析，普遍实行了与群众同吃、同住、同劳动，有事和群众同商量，有困难和群众同克服，根据所在地区存在问题，分别采取有效措施加以解决。对多数落后队采取的措施是：加强社会主义教育，提高干部和群众的思想觉悟，健全领导核心，坚持政治挂帅；宣传和贯彻党的政策，发动群众大力搞好生产；作好公社经营管理、帮助健全公共食堂等。天水市天水人民公社汪团生产队原来生产落后，公社党委书记来到这里，深入群众调查研究，找到工作赶不上的主要原因是领导落后，便耐心帮助支部书记提高思想觉悟，改进领导作风，合理安排农活，解决畜力不足等问题，播种进度显著加快。他们还采取先进带落后的办法，召开现场会议，促使落后队迅速赶上先进队。在原来落后的高台县平川公社四坝生产队，公社党委书记发现播种进度慢，便组织劳力到生产第一线，并脱鞋下田，和一百多名干部整稻槎地十八亩，带动了广大社员，四天时间抢种棉花五百三十多亩。
    广大干部深入生产第一线以后，全省农村又迅速出现跃进局面。据5月30日统计，全省播种日进度比4月底显著加快，天水专区每日播种十万亩，比月初进度提高80％。
    本报长沙10日电　中共湖南省桂阳县委根据天气日渐炎热、农活又很紧张的情况，对群众夏季生活全面地作了安排，保证社员吃好、睡好、休息好，使社员有饱满的精力和旺盛的劳动热情，有力地推动了夏季生产运动。
    中共桂阳县委对群众各个时期的生活安排一直是非常重视的，总是把抓好群众生活作为完成各项生产任务的一项重大措施。从4月下旬到5月中旬，县委曾先后通过两次会议研究布置了夏季生活问题。
    进一步办好公共食堂使社员吃饱、吃好，是夏季生活安排中的一件大事。县委对全县五千二百三十多个食堂，全面进行了整顿，开展了检查评比，进一步开展“五好”食堂的竞赛运动。在粮食安排方面，本着计划用粮、节约用粮的精神，进一步摸清了全部粮食底子，具体安排了到早稻收割前的五十来天的用粮计划。在安排食堂的同时，大抓蔬菜生产，通过发动群众，充分利用空坪隙地，全县扩种夏菜三万多亩，保证了每人每天能吃到二斤以上的蔬菜。
    除了抓好粮食以外，县委根据夏季日长夜短，适当安排群众的劳动和休息时间，做到有劳有逸，劳逸结合。县委规定保证每个社员有八小时睡眠，四小时的吃饭和休息时间。为了保证睡好、休息好，采取了三条措施：（1）大搞工具改革，普遍推广新式工具。全县使用十五种新式先进工具，劳动工效显著提高。（2）实行“四定”制度。即定时收工、定时出工、定时吃饭、定时睡眠。（3）适当控制晚上开会时间，开展文化娱乐活动，全县每个大队都建立了文化站，业余文工团，利用晚上或休息时间进行小演唱，活跃社员文化生活。
    继续开展了夏季爱国卫生运动，保护社员身体健康。各个食堂都因陋就简地建了澡堂。
    对一千多间漏雨的住房，由生产队安排劳力，帮助社员修缮。预分了一部分现金给社员，购买夏季日常生活用品。
    由于全区开展“四好”运动和党的无微不至的关心群众生活，及早安排好了群众夏季生活，社员个个心情舒畅，干劲冲天，劳动热情更加高涨，有力的推动了当前生产。（附图片）
