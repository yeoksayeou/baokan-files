Installing Automatic Equipment to Ensure Safe Boiler Operation
    Changchun Asbestos Factory Develops Three New Devices Including Boiler High-Low Water Level Controller

    (Our newspaper Changchun, 4th dispatch) The boiler section workers of the Changchun Asbestos Factory have recently successfully created automatic control devices for high and low water levels in boilers and automatic water supply alarms, as well as automatic control valves for boiler overpressure. These devices effectively ensure the safe operation of the boilers.

    The boilers in this section were left over from the period of enemy and puppet rule. Most of them have been in use for over forty years. Although various measures have been taken in recent years to ensure production safety, everyone was always worried about the safe operation of the boilers because there were no reliable safety control devices on the boilers. The most common accidents with boilers are related to water and gas. In the past, water levels in boilers were controlled manually, requiring constant attention to the water level. In situations with heavy smoke and malfunctioning water level gauges, explosions could easily occur.

    After the launch of the technical revolution movement, the factory Party committee promptly proposed the innovative requirement to conquer the automatic control of high and low water levels and gas pressure in the boilers to the boiler section. All twenty-two employees in the section enthusiastically responded to this call. Subsequently, they quickly proposed more than one hundred and twenty innovation suggestions for safe production and implemented sixty-three of them. At the same time, they also created important equipment and instruments to ensure the safe production of boilers, such as automatic control devices for high and low water levels in boilers with automatic water supply alarms, and automatic control safety valves for boiler overpressure. The successful manufacture of these safety devices makes it possible to automatically control the high and low water levels and gas pressure of the boiler entirely according to human will. When the water level is lower than the specified standard, the automatic control device for high and low water levels in the boiler and the automatic water supply alarm can immediately light up and sound an alarm, sending a low water level warning, and simultaneously start the water pump to automatically supply water; when the water level exceeds the specified standard, it can automatically stop. The automatic control safety valve for boiler overpressure was also created based on the principle of manufacturing alarms. When the boiler gas pressure exceeds the specified standard, the valve can be automatically opened, and the overpressure gas in the boiler will be discharged in large quantities.

    The emergence of automatic controllers for high and low water levels and automatic water supply alarms, and automatic controllers for overpressure, is the result of the factory's workers learning from the advanced experience of fraternal enterprises and further researching, developing, and creating them successfully. In February of this year, Wang Debin, an old worker and Communist Party member with more than ten years of boiler operating experience, was greatly inspired when he visited the "Low Water Level Automatic Controller" at the Qiqihar Rolling Stock Plant. After returning to the factory, he proposed a suggestion to trial-produce automatic control devices for high and low water levels and automatic water supply alarms. This suggestion immediately received the attention of the Party committee, which mobilized the entire factory to provide support. They didn't know how to make drawings or understand electrical technology, so they studied, made, and experimented simultaneously.

    In the creation process, the automatic alarm and automatic water supply of electric bells, sirens, and indicator lights were all critical. They found a lot of reference materials and overcame these difficulties. After more than twenty trials and ten days and nights of hard work, they successfully manufactured the automatic control device for high and low water levels in the boiler and the automatic water supply alarm. Subsequently, with the help of the electrical team, all the employees in the section continued to work hard for ten days and successfully created the boiler overpressure automatic safety valve, thereby achieving complete automation of safe boiler operation.

    装上自动设备保证锅炉安全运行
    长春石绵厂制成锅炉高低水位控制器等三项新装置
    本报长春4日电　长春石绵厂锅炉工段职工，最近创造成功锅炉高低水位自动控制和自动送水警报器、锅炉超压自动控制阀等自动化装置，从而切实有效地保证了锅炉的安全运行。
    这个工段的锅炉是敌伪时期遗留下来的。大多使用了四十多年。几年来，虽然采取了各种措施，保证了生产的安全，因为锅炉上还没有很可靠的安全控制设备，大家对锅炉的安全运行总是悬着心。锅炉最易发生事故的是水和气。过去锅炉上水都是用手掌握，需要时刻注意水位高低，在烟气大，水位仪表失灵的情况下，极容易发生爆炸事故。
    技术革命运动开展以后，厂党委及时向锅炉工段提出了攻下自动控制锅炉高低水位和气压的革新要求。全段二十二名职工，热烈响应了这一号召。接着，他们很快就提出了安全生产革新建议一百二十多件，实现了六十三件。同时还制成了锅炉高低水位自动控制和自动送水警报器、锅炉超压自动控制安全阀等保证锅炉安全生产的重要设备和仪器。这些安全装置的制造成功，从而可以做到完全按照人的意志，自动控制锅炉水位和气压的高低。当水位低于规定标准时，锅炉高低水位自动控制和自动送水警报器能立即灯亮、铃响，发出低水位警报，同时使水泵自动上水；当水位超出规定标准时，又能自动停车。锅炉超压自动控制安全阀，也是根据制造警报器的原理创造出来的。当锅炉气压超过规定标准时，阀门能自动拨开，锅炉中的超压气体就会大量排出。
    高低水位自动控制器和自动送水警报器、超压自动控制器的出现，是这个厂的工人学习了兄弟企业的先进经验，进一步研究发展创制成功的。今年2月，有十多年锅炉操作经验的老工人、共产党员王德彬，在参观齐齐哈尔市车辆厂“低水位自动控制器”时，受到很大启示。回厂后，就提出了试制高低水位自动控制和自动送水警报器的建议。这项建议，立即得到了党委的重视，并发动全厂职工进行支援。他们不会制图，不懂电气技术，就边研究，边制作，边试验。
    在创制中，电铃、汽笛、指示灯自动发出警报和自动送水都是关键，他们找了很多参考资料，攻下了这些难关。经过二十多次试验，苦战了十多个昼夜，才把锅炉高低水位自动控制和自动送水警报器制造成功。接着全段职工在电气小组的帮助下，又继续苦战了十天，创制成功了锅炉超压自动安全阀，从此使锅炉安全运行达到了全部自动化。
