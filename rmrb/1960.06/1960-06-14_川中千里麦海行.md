    A Thousand Miles of Wheat Fields in Central Sichuan
    Written by a Collective of Reporters Stationed in Sichuan for this Newspaper
    We traveled from Nanchong to Wusheng, from Guang'an to Yilong, traversing ten counties and cities, a round trip of over a thousand li. Everywhere we saw bountiful wheat harvests, and everywhere we heard joyous singing.

     Red Mountain Barren Land Transformed into Granaries
    Central Sichuan is characterized by undulating hills and overlapping peaks, with red mountains and bare ridges everywhere. Dig down a few inches and layers of red sandstone appear. The consecutive years of good harvests here are not due to particularly favorable natural conditions.

    We arrived at the Jianshe (Construction) People's Commune in Wusheng County, where we saw vast expanses of fertile terraced fields, like brocade belts encircling the mountains. The wheat was uniform and even, its heavy ears filling people with joy.

    More than one hundred and fifty days ago, Yin Zhuocheng, the Party Branch Secretary of the First Management District, held a rally on the northern slope in this area. He pledged to the commune Party committee on behalf of all the commune members in the district: "We will connect small plots into large fields, we will transform barren land into fertile land, and we will resolutely achieve a great turnaround for the land!" Look! Here, hoes are swung, moving soil layer by layer from the top of the slope to the bottom. There, transport teams carry fertile soil and mud from miles away. Mountain peaks are leveled, steep slopes are gentled, and hundreds of scattered plots are transformed into large terraced fields. This heroic feat, like a prairie fire, quickly spread throughout the commune. In one winter, most of the barren and sloping land in the commune underwent a great transformation.

    The large-scale soil improvement movement in the central Sichuan region began in 1958. Last year, another winter saw the transformation of thousands upon thousands of such red barren ridges, enabling both sloping and flat lands, good and bad soils, to achieve increased production.

    Dry Slopes and Arid Lands Sing of Bumper Harvests
    Traveling northwest from Nanchong, we arrived at Xichong County. Central Sichuan suffers from spring droughts every year. This spring, the rainfall in the entire region was more than 20% lower than in previous years. Xichong was the most severely affected by the drought. However, the fields here were still filled with a scene of a bountiful harvest.

    In the wheat fields of the Shuangfeng (Double Phoenix) Commune, groups of commune members were busily harvesting. Here, the girls sang mountain songs loudly: "The people's commune is powerful, not afraid of great disasters; We have grown a large dam of wheat, each ear plump and large"; There, the young men immediately replied with a poem: "Green mountains and lush songs surround us, thousands of acres of wheat fields roll like waves, today the golden waves have just passed, tomorrow we will paint again with a green brush." The songs seemed to make the golden, carved wheat ears dance along with the music.

    No wonder people are so jubilant, this harvest was indeed hard-won! The wheat seedlings were threatened by drought from the moment they emerged from the soil. With great difficulty, by carrying water bucket by bucket, load by load, they ensured the normal growth of the wheat seedlings. But then came a severe frost. The tips of the wheat leaves withered, and the water stored in the original ponds and dams had already been used up. What to do? The commune held an emergency meeting. The youth suggested drawing water from the river堰 (weir) several miles away, and they all eagerly signed up to join the water-drawing team.

    The next morning, from the riverbank to the hillside, hundreds of waterwheels were lined up in a row on the newly built ditches, with red flags fluttering on the waterwheels. The members of the youth team and the girls' team, who had been competing against each other since sowing, were unwilling to show weakness. Su Shaopu, a young man, didn't get off the waterwheel after finishing his shift. Chen Bofen of the girls' team immediately asked someone to bring food to the wheel so he could work another shift. For five whole days, everyone worked hard in shifts, drying up a river堰, soaking all the wheat fields to a depth of more than four inches. Three days later, the withered wheat seedlings turned green.

    The Shuangfeng Commune is a microcosm of the entire region's fight against drought for a good harvest. For several months, along the Jialing River, the Qu River, and hundreds of large and small rivers, countless "long dragons" worked day and night to transport sweet dew to the wheat fields. According to statistics, more than four million person-times were mobilized in the region for just three anti-drought campaigns, irrigating about half of the drought-affected wheat fields.

    Mountainous Areas and Plains are the Same
    Entering the mountainous areas of Cangxi and Yilong, large slogans such as "Mountainous areas catch up with the plains, one season equals one year" can be seen everywhere on the mountains, rocks, and walls.

    The Jiangjun (General) People's Commune in Yilong County was the first heroic commune in the county to propose that mountainous areas should catch up with the plains. From the beginning of wheat planting, they organized several visiting groups to learn high-yield experiences from Wusheng and Xichong in the plains and hilly areas. Each time they returned, the entire commune immediately launched discussions, made plans, and proposed measures. Commune members said, "What they can do, we can definitely do!"

    There is a towering General Mountain here, covered with thorns and rocks, where one mu of land used to yield only two hundred jin in two seasons. One winter night last year, countless torches lit up the mountains and fields. He Renliang, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch, led a youth shock team to the most dangerous rocky slope on the mountain. The young people, like tigers descending from the mountains, took up steel chisels, cross shovels, and carried explosives, camping on the mountain to transform the barren mountain. Lin Changjin, a member of the Communist Youth League, accidentally injured his foot with a stone. Everyone persuaded him to rest, but he said, "What does this count for in order to catch up with the plains?" After applying medicine, he immediately returned to the construction site. When this matter spread, it set off a wave of learning from Lin Changjin throughout the commune. In just a few days, more than three thousand high-efficiency red-flag workers emerged.

    In the past, after the wheat fields here were planted, management was always lacking. However, everything changed this year. The wheat in the entire commune was cultivated five times, fertilized every five days, and pest control was carried out every three days, implementing a series of advanced measures such as suppressing seedlings and cultivating soil.

    When we arrived here, the wheat had already been harvested, and hard work had finally yielded a bumper harvest.

    The County Party Secretary's Demonstration Plot
    During these wheat harvest days, we have been to so many places and visited so many high-yield wheat fields. Each one is more productive than the last, and each one is more endearing than the last. However, the best wheat fields are often those personally planted by Party secretaries at all levels.

    Everyone who sees the wheat demonstration plot of the Xichong County Party Committee cannot help but be amazed. In those one hundred mu of wheat fields, the wheat plants are densely packed, and the ears of wheat are heavily stacked, with each mu reaching four to five hundred thousand ears. Most ears have seventy to eighty grains, and many exceed one hundred grains. Walking into the field, people cannot be seen on either side. People call this demonstration plot the best among the best, and it truly deserves the title. From sowing to harvesting, it is impossible to calculate how many districts, how many cadres, and how many masses have come to visit. In many places in central Sichuan, whenever we ask about the origin of a new technology or new measure, we almost always get the same answer: "We learned it from Xichong!"

    Just as this wheat was being harvested, we came here. In front of the gathered visitors, a man wearing a straw hat and straw sandals was eloquently introducing the planting techniques of this field, and talking about the experience of preventing insects and wind. He knew everything about every plant in the field. This is Comrade Li Junwen, the County Party Secretary.

    However, this County Party Secretary, who is known as an "expert," only began learning to grow wheat when he established a demonstration plot here in October 1958. From that time on, he lived, ate, and worked with the commune members, jointly studying agricultural technology. On nights with heavy wind and rain, he and the commune members went to the mountains dozens of miles away in the rain to transport branches and rescue the lodged wheat... In this way, he went from familiar to specialized, and successively studied many advanced technologies with the commune members in soil improvement, rational close planting, fertilization, and soil cultivation. Once, he unintentionally discovered that the wheat seedlings trampled down when carrying manure had thick bases and grew particularly short and strong, so he associated this with seedling suppression during the seedling period. There was no habit of seedling suppression here. He personally experimented again and again, observing the effect in the field every day, and discussing it with veteran farmers and technical cadres. Finally, he summarized a complete set of seedling suppression techniques of early suppression, severe suppression, and frequent suppression, making the wheat grow better and effectively preventing lodging. This experience has been promoted to the entire prefecture this year.

    川中千里麦海行
    本报驻四川记者集体采写
    我们从南充到武胜，从广安到仪陇，先后历经十个县、市，行程往返一千多里。到处看到的是丰收的小麦，听到的是欢乐的歌唱。
     红山瘦土变粮仓
    川中，丘陵起伏，峰峦重叠，到处是红山、秃岭，挖下去几寸就现出一层层的赤色砂岩。这里连年丰收，并不是由于自然条件特别优惠。
    我们来到武胜县建设公社，只见大片大片肥沃的梯田，锦带般地环绕山间。麦子一崭齐，一个样，沉甸甸的麦穗，引得人心花怒放。
    一百五十多天以前，第一管理区支部书记尹卓成就在这一带地方的北山坡上誓师，他代表全管区社员向社党委保证：“要叫小土连大片，要叫瘦地变良田，坚决让土地大翻身！”看吧！这边，锄头挥舞，一层层把土从坡顶向坡下放去。那边，运土队从几里路以外挑来肥土肥泥。一个个山嘴削平了，陡坡放缓了，几百块零星地块变成了大片梯田。这个壮举像燎原之火，很快就烧遍全社，一个冬天，全社大部瘦土坡地就大变样。
    川中地区从1958年就开始了大规模的改良土壤运动。去年，一个冬天又改造了成千上万这样的红瘦岭，使坡上坡下、好土坏土全都获得了增产。干坡旱地唱丰收
    从南充西北行，来到了西充县。川中地区年年春旱。今年春天全区雨量又比往年少20％以上。而西充受旱最严重。但是，这儿田野上仍然洋溢着一片丰收的景象。
    在双凤公社的麦地里，一群群社员正在紧张地收割。这边，姑娘们高唱着山歌：“人民公社威力大，天大灾害也不怕；种出麦子一大坝，穗穗小麦肥又大”；那边，小伙子马上回诗一首：“青山翠谷歌声绕，千顷麦田翻波涛，今天金浪刚涌过，明朝又用绿笔描。”直唱得那赤金雕镂样的麦穗，似乎也伴和歌声翻飞起舞。
    难怪人们这样欢腾，这场丰收得来的确不易！麦苗从出土就受到干旱威胁。好容易靠着一挑挑、一担担地浇灌，才保证了麦苗正常生长。但接着又来了一场严霜。麦苗叶尖萎缩了，而原有塘堤蓄水早已用光了。怎么办？社里开了紧急会议，青年们建议从几里外河堰里引水，一个个争着报名参加车水队。
    第二天清晨，从河岸到山坡，在连夜赶修的沟渠上，成百架水车一字儿排开，水车上红旗飘飘。从播种时就开展了对手赛的青年队和姑娘队的队员们，谁也不肯示弱。小伙子苏绍普车完一班不下水车，姑娘队的陈伯芬立即请人把饭送到车上，要再干一班。整整五天，大家轮班苦战，把一座河堰车干，使全部麦地浸透四寸以上。三天后，干枯的麦苗就转青了。
    双凤公社是全区抗旱夺丰收的一个缩影。几个月来，沿着嘉陵江、渠江等千百条大小河川、有多少条“长龙”日夜不停地为麦田运送着甘露。据统计，全区仅三次抗旱高潮就出动了四百多万人次，使一半左右的受旱麦地得到灌溉。
    山区平坝一个样
    进入苍溪、仪陇山区，在山岩上、墙壁上到处可以看到“山区赶平坝，一季顶一年”的大幅标语。
    仪陇县将军公社是全县第一个提出山区赶平坝的英雄公社。从种麦开始，他们就几次组织了参观团到平坝丘陵区的武胜、西充去学习高产经验。每次一回来，全社立即展开讨论，订规划，提措施。社员们说：“他们能做到的事，我们也一定能做到！”
    这里有个高耸的将军山，满山荆棘岩石，过去一亩地两季只收二百多斤。去年冬天的一个深夜，无数火把照亮了山野。共青团支部书记何仁亮带着一支青年突击队，来到山上最艰险的石坡。青年们个个像出山的猛虎，拿起钢钎，十字锹，抬上炸药，在山上安营扎寨，改造荒山。共青团员林长金不小心被石头打伤了脚，大家劝他休息，他说：“为了赶上平坝，这算得了什么？”擦上药，马上又回到工地。这个事情一传开，全社掀起了学习林长金的热潮。短短几天就涌现了高工效红旗手三千多人。
    从前，这里的麦地种下以后，管理总是跟不上，然而，今年一切都变了。全社的麦子中耕达到五次，五天一次追肥，三天一次治虫，实行了压苗、培土等一系列先进措施。
    当我们来到这里时，麦子已经收完了，苦干终于获得了丰收。
    县委书记的指挥田
    在这麦收的日子里，我们走过多少地方，参观过多少高产麦田，真是一片比一片高产，一片比一片逗人爱。但是，最好的麦田，往往都是各级党委书记亲手参加种植的。
    每一个看到西充县委小麦指挥田的人，都不禁要为之惊叹。那一百亩麦田，麦株密密层层，麦穗重重叠叠，每亩达到四、五十万穗，一般麦穗都有七八十粒，许多超过一百粒。走到地里，两边看不见人。人们把这片指挥田称做标兵中的标兵，的确当之无愧。从播种到收获，已经无法计算有多少地区、多少干部和群众来参观过。在川中许多地方，每当我们问及一样新技术、新措施的由来，几乎都得到了同样的回答：“从西充学来的！”
    正当这片麦子收割时，我们来到这里。在群集的参观者面前，一位头戴草帽，脚穿草鞋的汉子，滔滔不绝地介绍着这片田的种植技术，谈着防虫防风的经验。他对地里的一草一木都了如指掌。这就是县委书记李君文同志。
    但是，这位被人称为“专家”的县委书记，学种麦也只是从1958年10月在这里建立指挥田时才开始的。他从那时起，便在这里和社员同吃同住同劳动，共同钻研农业技术。大风雨的夜里，他和社员们一块冒雨到几十里外的山上赶运树枝，抢救倒伏的小麦……。就这样，他由熟到专，先后和社员们研究出改造土壤、合理密植、施肥培土等方面的许多先进技术。有一次，他无意中发现挑粪时踩倒的麦苗，基部粗壮，长得分外矮健，于是联想到苗期镇压。这里从没有压苗的习惯，他亲自一次次地试验，天天到田间观察效果，和老农、技术干部共同探讨。最后总结出了早压、狠压、多压的成套压苗技术，使麦子长的更好，又有效地防止了倒伏。这一经验今年已经推广到全专区。
