    Train Rushes Forward
    Méi Yuán
    Upon arriving in the coal city of Hegang, what first caught my interest was not only the tall headframes of the mines but also the newly erected trolleybus lines in the city's streets. Building trolleybus lines in a city is no easy task. Yet Hegang, a city on the northeastern frontier of our motherland, is about to become a city with trolleybuses. Why is it developing so rapidly in this regard? Why does it not require new state investment to establish trolleybuses? It turns out that this is the result of the people's commune in Hegang.
    Hegang's railway transport, like the entire city, is undergoing tremendous transformation. In the past, the Hegang Mining Bureau and the railway department each had their own railway lines and locomotives, two separate teams, operating and managing independently. Railway lines crisscrossed the entire city, and coal loading points were scattered in forty locations. Often, the mining bureau and the railway department each had a station at the same location. When the railway department drove the wagons into the mining area, it had to go through many complicated transfer procedures with the mining bureau's railway, and it took a long time to load the coal from the various loading points onto the wagons before the coal could be transported out. As a result, a coal-loading train took thirteen or fourteen hours from entering Hegang to leaving Hegang. The turnover of wagons was slow, and the phenomenon of wagons waiting for coal or coal waiting for wagons often occurred.
    In the upsurge of communization, Hegang, based on the characteristics of local coal mine production, established the Hegang People's Commune, a single commune for the entire city. The People's Commune brought people new relations of production and organizational forms. In the commune, the mining bureau and the railway department became one family, transforming the original complex lines into a ring railway, establishing large coal storage yards, centralizing coal loading points, and unifying the management and dispatch of vehicles. After the transformation, a coal-loading train only took four hours from entering Hegang to leaving Hegang, saving a large number of railway lines and locomotives. And some of the power lines from the electric locomotives that originally ran on the mining bureau's lines were used to erect the city's trolleybuses.
    Our socialist system provides ample conditions for continuously improving the relations of production and developing the productive forces. This is the incomparable superiority of the socialist system. Our socialist enterprises produce according to the needs of the state and the production plan, which is impossible for capitalist enterprises. However, before the establishment of urban communes, some of our enterprises often arranged their operations only from the perspective of their own system's leadership, only from the perspective of their own enterprise, and only from the "convenience" of their own unit. This is the reason why some places in the past had unreasonable phenomena such as overlapping technical equipment and redundant personnel between various enterprises. The establishment of urban people's communes integrates a region into a unified whole, unified planning, making the production of the entire society more scientific and rational. The Hegang People's Commune is a prominent example.
    Since the establishment of the Hegang People's Commune, a situation of comprehensive leaps forward in various undertakings is now emerging. The ring railway is only one example. On the day the eastern ring railway of Hegang was opened to traffic, we had the opportunity to ride the first train around the ring line for a week. Now, the train no longer needs to go to the transfer station between the mining bureau and the railway department to go through complicated procedures. People on the train and along the way sang and cheered, celebrating the opening of the ring railway and feeling extremely excited. Sitting on the train, I suddenly thought: what we are sitting on is not an ordinary train, but a train rushing towards communism. Our train, under the leadership of the glorious Party – the locomotive – is running smoothly and rushing forward along the track of the urban people's commune – the road to communist happiness…

    列车奔驰向前

    到达煤城鹤岗，首先引起我兴趣的，不仅是那高大的竖井，还有街道上空新架设的无轨电车线路。在城市里建设起无轨电车，这不是一件容易的事，然而鹤岗这个祖国东北边疆的城市，却要成为有无轨电车的城市了。为什么它在这方面发展如此迅速？为什么它建立无轨电车并不需要国家新的投资呢？原来这是鹤岗人民公社化的结果。
    鹤岗的铁路运输，和整个城市一样，正进行着巨大的改造。过去鹤岗矿务局和铁路部门各有自己的铁路线和火车头，两套人马，分别经营管理，全市铁路纵横交错，列车装煤点分散在四十处。往往在同一个地点，矿务局和铁路部门各设一个车站。铁路部门将车辆驶进矿区，需要同矿务局的铁路办理许多复杂的交接手续，需要花很长的时间把各个装煤点的煤炭装上车才能把煤运出去。这样，一辆装煤的列车，从进鹤岗到出鹤岗，需要十三、四个小时，车皮周转慢，经常出现车等煤或煤等车的现象。
    在公社化高潮中，鹤岗根据当地主要是煤矿生产的特点，建立了一市一社的鹤岗人民公社。人民公社给人们带来了新的生产关系和组织形式。在公社里，矿务局和铁路部门成为一家，把原有的繁杂的线路改造成环行铁路，建立大型贮煤仓，集中装煤点，统一管理和调度车辆。经过改造，一列装煤的火车，从进鹤岗到出鹤岗，只要四个小时，节约了大量铁路线和机车，而一些原先行驶在矿务局线路上的电气机车的电线就被用来架设市内的无轨电车了。
    我们的社会主义制度为不断改进生产关系、发展生产力提供了充分的条件。这是社会主义制度的无比优越性。我们的社会主义企业，是按照国家需要和生产计划进行生产的，这是资本主义企业无法做到的。但在城市公社化前，我们有些企业，往往因为只从本系统的领导，只从本企业的角度考虑问题，只从本单位的“方便”出发来进行企业的安排。这是过去有些地方各个企业之间发生技术装备设置重叠、人员重复等等不合理现象的原因。城市人民公社的建立，把一个地区结成一盘棋，统一规划，使整个社会的生产，组织得更科学，更合理。鹤岗人民公社就是一个突出的例子。
    鹤岗人民公社建立以后，现在正在出现各项事业齐跃进的局面，环行铁路，只是其中的一个例子而已。在鹤岗东部环行铁路通车的那天，我们有机会乘上了第一列火车绕环行路一周。现在，列车已经用不着到矿务局和铁路部门之间的交接站去办理复杂的手续了。列车上的和沿途的人们歌唱、欢呼，庆祝环行铁路的通车，感到无比的兴奋。我坐在车上，顿时想到：我们坐的并不是一列普通的火车，而是奔向共产主义的列车。我们的列车在火车头——光荣的党的领导下，正沿着城市人民公社的轨道——通向共产主义的幸福之路，畅行无阻，奔驰向前……
