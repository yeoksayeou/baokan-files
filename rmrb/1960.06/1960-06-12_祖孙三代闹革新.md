    Three Generations of a Family Making Revolution
     By Our Reporter Zhou Xichen
    At the foot of beautiful Mount Hui, there is a rising factory – the Wuxi Ceramics Factory No. 1. Yu Hedi, a national "March 8th" Red Banner holder and advanced producer of Wuxi City, is a female worker in the factory's blank-making workshop. Her mother, Xia Jinmei, her husband, Gao Xiaofan, her eldest daughter, Gao Zhiyun, and her second son, Gao Yaogang, are also workers in the factory. In the surging tide of the technological revolution, each of the five members of this family is bravely advancing, with each making innovations and no one falling behind. Therefore, people call this family a glorious family of technological revolution.
      Innovation Suggestions at the Dinner Table
    One day, lunch was already on the table, and Yu Hedi's younger children and their grandmother had already started eating. Hedi, while urging the children to eat, kept looking towards the door, thinking, "Why hasn't Zhiyun returned yet?"
    Before long, a pretty girl hurried in, sat down without a word, picked up a bowl of rice, and ate with her head down. This was Zhiyun. Hedi felt strange and kept looking at her eldest daughter, wondering, "Why is this child so silent today? Is something on her mind?"
    After the grandmother and the children finished eating and left the table, Hedi asked Zhiyun, "Has the pipe bending machine been made?" "The pipe bending machine has been successfully trial-produced, but the pipe bending joints can't keep up. We are now thinking of making a pipe bending joint machine. The base is already made, but the pipe bending part is not stable on top and always falls down." The daughter frowned tightly, answering with a troubled mind.
    Hedi felt both pain and love seeing her daughter so worried. This female worker, who has thirty years of blank-making experience, pondered for a moment and said, "How about thinking of a way to make a loop with a rope to hang one end of the bent pipe? That way, maybe it won't fall." "Oh, that's a good idea. I thought about it before, but I didn't know if it would work." The daughter's frown relaxed, and she looked at her mother gratefully, her face showing the playful, cheerful expression of the past.
    That night, Gao Zhiyun, the captain of the technological revolution youth rocket squad, and the girls gathered again in the workshop and started a tense experiment according to the method mentioned by Gao Zhiyun's mother. By 11 o'clock, the pipe bending joint machine was finally successfully trial-produced. The bent pipe blank was placed on a potter's wheel, and a ring was placed on top of it, so the pipe rotated quickly and steadily with the potter's wheel. It only took two minutes to join the head of a bent pipe. What used to take a day's work can now be completed in an hour. The girls' happy laughter broke the silent night sky.
        Family Meeting Breaks the Key
    The news of the cracking of twenty-four acid storage tanks spread throughout the factory in an instant. This major event in the factory became the topic of Yu Hedi's entire family.
    After dinner, Yu Hedi's home was very lively, with the children talking and laughing. The four-year-old daughter, without being urged, stood on the bed and shook her head while singing the songs she learned in the nursery. Yu Hedi, while taking care of the children, was thinking about the cracking of the twenty-four acid storage tanks.
    Just then, her husband, Gao Xiaofan, returned. He sat down silently at the table, lit a cigarette, and silently looked at everyone. He was also thinking about what Director Gao said at the kiln meeting that afternoon. Yes, a kiln fires a total of twenty-six tanks, and twenty-four of them broke at once. This is no small matter. And how much hard work did so many people put in before these tanks were taken to the kiln!
    "You, the workshop director, are responsible for this matter!" Hedi broke the silence and said to her husband. Zhiyun also said loudly to her father indignantly, "You, you manage this and manage that, but you can't manage your own firing workshop well." "Alas, if this continues, the factory will collapse!" Hedi's mother, Xia Jinmei, a sixty-year-old glazing worker, sighed softly on the side. This old worker, who had lived in the old society for most of her life, could never forget those days of hunger and cold. In 1958, when the ceramics factory No. 1 was first built, the whole place was overgrown with weeds and graves. Although Xia Jinmei was already an elderly person, she also rolled up her trouser legs like the young people and participated in the construction of the factory. Now, she felt particularly heartbroken when she heard about this.
    "What do you think is the reason for this accident?" Hedi asked her husband. Gao Xiaofan, relying on his decades of experience working at the kiln, said with certainty, "It was when cooling down, cold air entered the kiln and cracked the tanks." Cold air entered the kiln and cracked the tanks. How can we prevent cold air from entering the kiln? Everyone was thinking about this problem in silence.
    "How about making a ceramic tube and putting it on the peephole?" Gao Xiaofan spoke first. Zhiyun said, "The peephole is slanted, how can the tube be put on?" "That's easy, just cut the ceramic tube slanted too." Yao Gang said slowly. After a while, Zhiyun raised another question: "If you connect a straight tube, won't the wind still blow in?" "That's right, installing a straight tube is the same as not installing one." Hedi agreed with her daughter's opinion. With that, everyone had nothing more to say.
    "Can we install something movable on the tube, like a hat, so that if the wind comes from the east, the opening turns to the west; if the wind comes from the north, the opening turns to the south..." After Gao Xiaofan said this, everyone became active again. "Yes, that's a good idea." So everyone chimed in with ideas, and as a result, they decided to make a rotatable windbreak tube. But who could make this tube? "Isn't Mom a 'March 8th' Red Banner holder? Can't she help with this little thing?" The children were putting their mother "on the spot." The husband also looked at his wife with a smile. This made Hedi a little embarrassed. This family meeting lasted until after ten o'clock. This key production problem of the entire factory was solved at this family meeting.
        Husband and Wife Experiment Late at Night
    The rainy days came. The ceramic blanks made by the ceramics factory could not dry for a long time, which seriously threatened the factory's production. The leadership called on everyone: "We can't rely on the weather. We must actively think of ways to solve this problem."
    This time, it was Gao Xiaofan's turn to urge Yu Hedi: "What are you going to give us to fire? You have to use your brains and make innovations!" Hedi was even more anxious. The couple often lay in bed discussing until late at night. "We can't rely on the weather. We should bake with fire." This was the unanimous opinion of the two. But they were also afraid that the volume of the tanks was too large and the heat would not be uniform, causing cracks. "Put the charcoal fire in an iron wire cage and suspend it in the tank to bake. Wouldn't the heat dissipation be even?" The husband, who had been dealing with charcoal fire, finally thought of this wonderful method.
    One night, it was raining outside, but a corner of the first blank-making workshop was still shining with the light of charcoal fire. Yu Hedi and her husband were surrounding a large tank blank, with a small stove burning brightly inside the tank. It turned out that they were quietly conducting an experiment on furnace drying!
    The couple looked at the stove fire and touched the tank blank from time to time, while talking about work and study. Yu Hedi felt warm in her heart and felt unprecedented pleasure. She and Gao Xiaofan had been married for more than twenty years, and their relationship could be considered good, but they had never cared for and cared for each other so much, studied production together, and made innovations together as they did today.
    The couple was talking enthusiastically around the gradually drying tank blank when the chairman of the factory trade union, Lu, inspected here in the rain. "Good, you two are hiding here making innovations!" So, the three of them carefully checked again and found that the tank blank was heated evenly and contracted normally. They immediately designed a small stove with fire on all four sides based on this principle and promoted its use in the factory on a large scale.
        Old Grandmother Not to be Outdone
    The technological revolution movement in the factory became more and more enthusiastic. Yu Hedi, Gao Zhiyun, Gao Xiaofan, and Gao Yaogang had all completed many innovation projects. Yu Hedi's mother – Xia Jinmei, a sixty-year-old glazing worker, although she had also made innovations in glazing and repairing ceramic blanks, she was not satisfied with these. One day, when her eldest grandson, Gao Haigang, who worked at the Dingshan Ceramics Factory, came home, she said to Haigang: "Haigang! Your mother, your father, and your younger brother and sister have all made many innovations, leaving only me, this old woman, behind! Good boy, you also help your great aunt to come up with an idea!" Haigang readily agreed: "Okay, great aunt, don't worry, I will definitely think of a good way for you."
    Later, Haigang helped his grandmother design a glaze sprayer. Originally, to glaze the inner wall of a ceramic jar, you had to use a small spoon to scoop the glaze in and then shake and rotate it many times to coat the inner wall. Now, a small hole is opened in the glaze-filled tank, a leather tube is connected, one end is immersed in the glaze, and the other end is connected to a leather ball. As long as the ceramic jar is dipped into the glaze tank and the leather ball is stepped on, not only is the outside glazed well, but the inner wall is also evenly sprayed with glaze. This is both light and fast. This ingenious design made the old grandmother smile from ear to ear. (Attached picture)

    祖孙三代闹革新
     本报记者　周惜晨
    在美丽的惠山脚下，有一座新兴的工厂——无锡陶瓷一厂。全国“三八”红旗手、无锡市先进生产者虞荷娣，就是这个厂制坯车间的女工。她的母亲夏金妹、丈夫高肖范、大女儿高织云、二儿子高耀刚也都是这个厂的工人。在汹涌澎湃的技术革命浪潮里，这一家五口人，个个奋勇向前，每人都有革新，没有一个掉队的。因此，人们称这个家庭为技术革命光荣之家。
      饭桌上的革新建议
    一天，中午饭菜都已经摆在桌上，虞荷娣的几个小的孩子和他们的外婆已经吃将起来。荷娣一面招呼孩子们吃饭，一面向门口张望，心想：“织云怎么还不回来？”
    不多会，一个俏丽的姑娘匆匆忙忙走了进来，坐下来一声不响，端起一碗饭闷着头就吃。这就是织云。荷娣心里奇怪，不住地用目光打量着大女儿，“这孩子今天怎么闷声不响的，有了什么心事？”
    外婆和小孩们吃完饭离开饭桌以后，荷娣问织云：“弯管机做好了没有？”“弯管机倒是试制成功了，可是弯管接头又跟不上了。我们现在正想做个弯管接头机，底座已经做好了，就是弯管朝上一套，上面立不牢，总是要倒下来。”女儿紧紧地皱着眉头，满腹心事地回答。
    荷娣看女儿愁得这个样子，心里又疼又爱。这个已经有三十年制坯经验的女工，沉思了一会儿说：“好不好想个办法，用绳子做一个环，把弯管的一头吊起来？那样也许就不会倒了。”“嗳，这倒是个好法子。我本来也这样想过，就是不知行不行。”女儿的愁眉舒展了，她感激地看着母亲，脸上又露出了往日那种调皮、欢快的神情。
    当天晚上，技术革命青年火箭突击队队长高织云和姑娘们又聚到车间里，按照高织云的母亲谈的办法，开始了紧张的试验活动。到十一点多钟，弯管接头机终于试制成功了。把弯管的坯子放在辘轳车上，上面用一个圈子一套，管子就平稳地随着辘轳车飞快转动，只需二分钟，一只弯管的头就接好了。过去一天的工作，现在一个小时就可以完成。姑娘们快乐的说笑声划破了寂静的夜空。
        家庭会议破关键
    二十四只储酸缸破裂的消息，霎时传遍全厂。这件厂内的大事，成为虞荷娣全家的议题。
    晚饭后，虞荷娣的家里显得很热闹，孩子们又说又笑。四岁的小女儿不用人动员，自己就站在床上摇头摆脑地唱起了她在托儿所学的歌曲。虞荷娣一边照应着孩子，一边在想着二十四只储酸缸破裂的事情。
    正在这个时候，丈夫高肖范回来了。他不声不响地在桌旁坐下，点燃一支烟，沉默地望着大家。他也正在想着高厂长下午在窑上开会时说的话。是啊，一窑总共烧二十六只缸，一下子就坏了二十四只，这不是件小事。而且这些缸在拿到窑上烧以前，曾花费了多少人的辛勤劳动啊！
    “这件事情，你这个车间主任要负责任啊！”荷娣打破了沉默，对丈夫说。织云也愤愤地对着父亲大声说：“你呀，东也管管，西也管管，就是你自己的烧成车间管不好。”“唉，照这样下去，厂子不要搞垮啦！”荷娣的母亲、六十岁的老上釉工人夏金妹在一旁轻轻地叹息着说。这个老工人，在旧社会里生活了大半辈子，她怎么也不会忘记那些饥寒交迫的日子。1958年，陶瓷一厂刚建厂的时候，这里全是一片荒草和坟堆。夏金妹虽然已经是上了年纪的人了，但她也像青年人一样，卷起裤脚管，参加了建厂工作。现在，她听到这件事格外心痛。
    “你说这次事故究竟是什么原因呢？”荷娣问丈夫。高肖范凭着在窑上干了几十年的经验，有把握地说：“是在冷却的时候，窑里进了冷风，把缸激破了。”进了冷风把缸激破了，怎样才能使窑里不进冷风呢？大家都在默默地想着这个问题。
    “做一只陶管，套在灵眼洞上怎么样？”还是高肖范先开口。织云说：“灵眼洞是斜的，管子怎样套上去？”“那还不好办，把陶管也切成斜的就是了。”耀刚慢条斯理地说。过了一会儿，织云又提了个问题：“接上个直筒子的管子，风还不是一样吹进去？”“那就是，装个直管子和不装没有两样。”荷娣同意女儿的意见。这样一来，大家又没得话讲了。
    “能不能在管子上装个活动的东西，像帽子一样，风从东边来，口就转向西边；风从北边来，口就转向南边……”经高肖范这么一说，大家顿时又活跃起来。“对，这办法不错。”于是大家七嘴八舌地出主意，结果，决定做一只可以转动的避风管。可是，谁能做这个管子呢？“娘是‘三八’红旗手，帮这点小忙还不成吗？”儿女们在“将”自己母亲的“军”。丈夫也笑迷迷地看着妻子。这倒把个荷娣闹得有点不好意思起来。这个家庭会议，直开到十点多钟。这个全厂的生产关键问题，就在这个家庭会议上解决了。
        夫妻俩深夜搞试验
    多雨的日子来了。陶瓷厂制成的泥坯迟迟不能干燥，严重地威胁着全厂的生产。领导上号召大家：“不能靠天吃饭，要积极想办法解决这个问题。”
    这一回该高肖范催虞荷娣了：“你们拿什么给我们烧呀，得动动脑筋搞搞革新啦！”荷娣心里更是焦急。两口子常常趟在床上商量到深夜。“不能靠天吃饭了，应当用火烘。”这是二人一致的意见。但是又怕缸的体积太大，受热不匀要裂缝。“把炭火放在铁丝笼子里悬在缸里烘，散热不就均匀了吗？”丈夫不愧是同炭火打交道的，终于想到了这个妙法。
    一天深夜，外边下着雨，第一制坯车间的一角却还闪射着炭火的光亮。虞荷娣和她的丈夫正围在一只大缸坯旁边，缸里吊着一个烧得正旺的小火炉。原来，他们正在悄悄地进行炉火干燥的试验哩！
    夫妇俩一边不时看看炉火，摸摸缸坯，一边扯着工作、学习的事儿。虞荷娣心里暖烘烘的，感到从来没有过的快意。她和高肖范结婚已经二十多年，夫妻感情也算得上是好的了，但是像今天这样互相关心，互相体贴，一起研究生产，一同搞革新，还是从来没有过的事情。
    这一对夫妻正围着渐渐干燥的缸坯，谈得热烈，厂工会陆主席冒雨巡视到这里。“好啊，你们两口子躲在这里搞革新哪！”于是，三个人又仔细检查一番，发现缸坯受热均匀，收缩正常。他们当场就根据这个原理设计了一种四面透火的小炉子，在厂里大量推广使用。
        老外婆不甘示弱
    厂里技术革命运动搞得越来越热烈。虞荷娣、高织云、高肖范、高耀刚都搞成了不少革新项目。虞荷娣的妈妈——六十岁的上釉工人夏金妹，虽然在上釉、整修陶坯等方面也有过革新，但是她对这些都不满足。有一天，在丁山陶瓷厂做工的大外孙高海刚一回家，她就向海刚说：“海刚啊！你娘、你爹和你弟弟、妹妹都有好多革新啦，就剩我这个老太婆落后啦！好孩子，你也帮舅婆出出主意吧！”海刚满口答应：“好的，舅婆你放心，我一定给你想个好办法。”
    后来，海刚帮助外婆设计了一个喷釉器。原来给陶罐内壁上釉，要用小勺子把釉舀进去，再晃呀晃的转动多次才能涂遍内壁。现在，把盛釉的缸上开个小孔，通进一根皮管，一头浸在釉里，另一头接上一只皮球，只要将陶罐向釉缸里一浸，用脚将皮球一踩，不仅外边上好了，内壁也均匀地喷满了釉。这样，既轻便又快当。这个巧妙的设计直乐得老外婆笑不合口。（附图片）
