    The Soviet government submitted new proposals on the disarmament issue to governments of all countries on June 2nd. This is another effort by the Soviet Union to consolidate world peace and ensure international security. The Chinese government and people support this effort by the Soviet government.
    As everyone knows, the Soviet Union proposed a proposal on general and complete disarmament to the United Nations General Assembly on September 18, 1959. This proposal received enthusiastic support from the vast number of people in various countries. Under the pressure of world public opinion, Western countries, led by the United States, had to agree to resume negotiations on the issue of disarmament. However, in the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee meeting that began on March 15, they insisted on a stubborn position, insisting on using supervision without disarmament to replace disarmament with supervision, and doing everything possible to evade and obstruct the discussion of the Soviet disarmament plan. Due to the deliberate obstruction by the United States and its Western partners, the first phase of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee meeting yielded no results. Now, on the eve of the resumption of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee, the Soviet Union has put forward new disarmament proposals. The new Soviet proposal adopts some of the opinions of Western countries. In this way, it further eliminates the excuses Western countries used in the past to evade comprehensive disarmament. People have every reason to demand that Western countries earnestly conduct negotiations on the issue of disarmament on the basis of the new Soviet proposal at the resumed Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee meeting. As pointed out in our government's statement, "The Soviet government's new disarmament proposal is a test for imperialist countries, and rejecting this proposal will further expose the peace deception of imperialist countries headed by the United States."
    Past historical facts show that imperialist countries, led by the United States, are unwilling to disarm, especially they are absolutely unwilling to carry out complete and thorough disarmament. Before World War II, as early as 1922, the Soviet Union put forward the proposition of disarmament, and in 1928, it proposed a comprehensive and thorough disarmament proposal. In 1932, it proposed at the International Disarmament Conference held in Geneva to pass an international disarmament convention, but all of these were rejected by imperialist countries. The victorious countries, such as the United States, Britain, and France, on the one hand, stepped up the arms race, and on the other hand, connived with Hitler's Germany to rearm, enabling it to make a comeback within a few years and launch another war of aggression. After the end of World War II, the Soviet Union made unremitting efforts to achieve general disarmament, and put forward disarmament proposals time and time again. However, imperialist countries, led by the United States, always came up with various excuses to oppose and refuse to accept them. Western countries' tricks to obstruct disarmament are endless. Every time when the Soviet Union adopted some of the proposals of Western countries in order to bring the opinions of both sides closer, they always went back on their words and immediately retreated from their original proposals, setting up new obstacles. Therefore, disarmament negotiations for more than ten years are simply like a game of hide-and-seek. You advance one step, and they retreat two steps, and an agreement can never be reached. In the activities of Western countries obstructing disarmament for many years, the United States has played a leading role, while other Western countries have followed the US policy step by step. Therefore, it is not surprising that the work of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee has never achieved any success.
    Who wants war and who wants peace has become clearer to the people of the world due to the recent blatant provocations by the United States against the Soviet Union and its blatant destruction of the Four-Power Summit Conference. After destroying the Four-Power Summit Conference, the United States has made every effort to incite war hysteria, intensify international tension, and step up its arms race. US Secretary of the Army Bruck openly announced that the United States should "strengthen" its "defense" including "the entire world." US President Eisenhower also vigorously advocated in a radio address on May 25: "We must maintain our strength and maintain it for a long time." The continued intensification of war preparations by the United States in the past half month fully proves that the US destruction of the Four-Power Summit Conference was a predetermined step in its plan to carry out aggression and prepare for war. Facing the war conspiracy of the United States, the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union naturally has to be a hundred times more vigilant and be ready at any time to give the provocateurs and aggressors a merciless rebuff.
    Imperialist countries, led by the United States, are doing everything possible to obstruct disarmament because they are unwilling to abandon their policies of aggression and war. After World War II, the revolutionary movement of the people of the world rose to an unprecedented level, and imperialism had to rely more on military force to maintain its rule. US imperialism, the largest and most greedy imperialism in the world, pinned its plan to dominate the world entirely on the arms race. For more than ten years, US imperialism, under the guise of anti-Soviet and anti-communist, has desperately expanded its military forces, established military bases everywhere, and pieced together aggressive military blocs. The purpose of the United States in doing so is first of all to suppress the people's revolutionary movements in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and even European countries, and to place these countries under its control for plunder and exploitation. In order to maintain its rule and exploitation of its own working people, in order to maintain its oppression and plunder of other countries, in order to maintain its colonial rule over the people of colonies and semi-colonies, in order to maintain its bases of aggression and war all over the world, and in order to maintain its so-called "deterrent power," imperialism, led by the United States, will never agree to complete and thorough disarmament. Because the imperialist monopoly capitalist groups, who live by sucking the blood of the working people, know that if complete and thorough disarmament is really achieved, their cannibalistic rule will not last even for a day.
    The history of the disarmament struggle since the war best illustrates that the aggressive nature of imperialism will never change, and that the vigilance of the people of all countries against the danger of war must not be relaxed as long as imperialism still exists. At present, due to the changes in the balance of world forces and the unprecedented strength of the forces of world peace, the possibility of preventing a world war exists, but it cannot be said that "war can now be eliminated forever," it cannot be said that "there is now a real possibility of fundamentally eliminating any war from modern social life," and even less can it be said that "mankind has entered an era of permanent peace." Spreading any unrealistic illusions of peace will only numb the masses of the people, which is conducive to the imperialists' conspiracy to prepare for a new war and is detrimental to the cause of world peace.
    On the issue of disarmament, the different attitudes of socialist countries and imperialist countries reflect the different foreign policies of the two social systems. Imperialism always uses force as a tool to pursue its foreign policy. In contrast, socialist countries have always advocated resolving international issues through peaceful consultation and advocated peaceful coexistence among countries with different social systems. However, facing the fully armed and ambitious imperialist group headed by the United States, socialist countries have every reason to maintain a high degree of vigilance and strengthen their armed forces in order to defend the socialist motherland and defend world peace. Of course, whenever possible, we always advocate reducing armaments in order to ease international tensions. The Chinese people have always supported the Soviet government's past efforts to achieve disarmament. The Chinese government has also stated that China has never hesitated to undertake all international obligations it undertakes. However, without the formal participation of the People's Republic of China and its representatives' signatures, international agreements on disarmament and all other international agreements will, of course, not be binding on China in any way.
    The new disarmament proposal put forward by the Soviet Union should be another call to the people of all countries in the world to strengthen the struggle for peace. The struggle of the people of all countries for disarmament is a struggle to expose and oppose imperialism, especially US imperialism's frenzied arms race. This struggle is increasingly mobilizing the peace forces of the world and powerfully attacking the US imperialist policies of aggression and war. The people of socialist countries have always stood at the forefront of this struggle. In the United States and other capitalist countries, more and more people can no longer endure the heavy burden of military spending imposed on them and strongly oppose the war policy of US imperialism. In those countries tied to the US chariot, more and more people realize the dangerous situation to which US imperialism is dragging their countries, and they are opposing their governments for "pulling chestnuts out of the fire" for the United States. If general disarmament can be achieved, it will be beneficial to the people of all countries. However, war is inseparable from the nature of imperialism, and the war policy of US imperialism has not changed. Therefore, the people of all countries must strengthen the struggle, constantly expose the US imperialist arms race activities, and attack all its conspiracies to obstruct disarmament and undermine peace. The statement of our government pointed out: "Only through the unremitting struggle of the people of all countries in the world, and by isolating imperialism, headed by the United States, to the greatest extent, can it be possible to force the imperialist countries to sit down for serious disarmament negotiations, to postpone or even prevent the imperialist plan to launch a new world war, and to ensure world peace." The people of all countries should further mobilize and launch a larger-scale struggle against US arms expansion and war preparations and to safeguard world peace.

### 加强人民斗争，保障世界和平

    加强人民斗争，保障世界和平
    苏联政府在6月2日向各国政府提出了关于裁军问题的新建议，这是苏联为巩固世界和平和保障国际安全而作的又一次努力。中国政府和人民支持苏联政府的这一努力。
    大家知道，苏联在1959年9月18日曾经向联合国大会提出了一项关于普遍裁军的建议，这个建议得到了各国广大人民的热烈支持。在世界舆论的压力下，以美国为首的西方国家不得不同意恢复裁军问题的谈判。但是，它们在从3月15日开始举行的十国裁军委员会会议中却一直坚持顽固的立场，硬要用没有裁军的监督来代替有监督的裁军，竭力逃避和阻挠讨论苏联的裁军方案。由于美国和它的西方伙伴故意制造障碍，十国裁军委员会的第一阶段的会议毫无成果。现在苏联在十国裁军委员会复会的前夕，提出了新的裁军建议。苏联的新建议，采纳了西方国家的某些意见。这样，就进一步解除了西方国家过去逃避全面裁军的借口。人们完全有理由要求西方国家在复会后的十国裁军委员会上认真地在苏联新建议的基础上就裁军问题进行谈判。正如我国政府声明所指出的，“苏联政府的新的裁军建议，是对帝国主义国家的一个考验，拒绝这个建议将进一步揭露以美国为首的帝国主义国家的和平欺骗”。
    过去的历史事实表明，以美国为首的帝国主义国家是不肯裁军的，特别是绝不肯全面彻底裁军。第二次世界大战之前，远在1922年，苏联就提出裁军的主张，1928年提出全面彻底裁军建议，1932年又在日内瓦召开的国际裁军会议上，建议通过一个国际裁军公约，但是都遭到了帝国主义国家的拒绝。美、英、法等战胜国一方面加紧进行军备竞赛，另一方面纵容希特勒德国重整军备，使它能够在几年之内东山再起，再一次发动侵略战争。第二次世界大战结束以后，苏联又为争取实现普遍裁军进行不懈的努力，一次又一次提出裁军建议。但是，以美国为首的帝国主义国家总是拿出各种各样的借口来反对和拒绝接受。西方国家阻挠裁军的把戏是层出不穷的。每一次当苏联为了使双方意见接近，采纳了西方国家建议中的一些主张的时候，它们又总是出尔反尔，立即从自己原来的主张后退，设置新的障碍。因此十多年来裁军谈判，就简直像是一场捉迷藏。你进一步，他退两步，怎么也达不成协议。在西方国家多少年来一直阻挠裁军的活动中，美国起着主导的作用，而其他西方国家则对美国的政策亦步亦趋。因此，十国裁军委员会的工作始终没有成就是毫不奇怪的。
    究竟谁要战争，谁要和平，由于最近美国对苏联进行明目张胆的挑衅和悍然破坏四国首脑会议，全世界人民已经看得更清楚了。美国在破坏了四国首脑会议以后，竭力煽动战争歇斯底里，加剧国际紧张局势，加紧扩军备战活动。美国陆军部长布鲁克公开宣布，美国要“加强”包括“整个世界”的“防务”。美国总统艾森豪威尔在5月25日的广播演说中也大肆鼓吹：“我们必须保持我们的实力，并且长期保持下去”。最近半个月来美国继续加紧准备战争的活动，完全证明了美国破坏四国首脑会议，是它进行侵略和准备战争计划中一个预定的步骤。面对着美国的战争阴谋，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营自然不能不百倍提高警惕，随时准备好给予挑衅者和侵略者以无情的回击。
    以美国为首的帝国主义国家千方百计阻挠裁军，是因为它们不肯放弃侵略政策和战争政策。第二次世界大战以后，世界人民的革命运动空前高涨，帝国主义更加要依靠军事力量来维持它们的统治。美帝国主义，这个世界上最大、最贪婪的帝国主义，把它独霸世界的计划完全寄托于扩军备战。十几年来，美帝国主义在反苏反共的幌子下，拼命地扩充军备，到处建立军事基地，拼凑侵略性的军事集团。美国这样做的目的首先是镇压亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲甚至欧洲国家的人民革命运动，把这些国家置于它的控制之下，进行掠夺和剥削。以美国为首的帝国主义为了保持对本国劳动人民的统治和剥削，为了保持对其他国家的压迫和掠夺，为了保持对殖民地、半殖民地人民的殖民统治，为了保持它们在全世界各地的侵略和战争基地，为了保持它们的所谓“威慑力量”，它们是决不会同意全面彻底裁军的。因为靠吸吮劳动人民膏血生活的帝国主义垄断资本集团知道，如果真的实现全面彻底裁军，它们的吃人生番的统治连一天也维持不了。
    战后以来裁军斗争的历史，最好不过地说明了帝国主义的侵略本性是永远不会改变的，也说明了在帝国主义还存在的情况下，各国人民对于战争危险的警惕就决不能放松。目前由于世界力量对比的变化，世界和平力量的空前强大，制止世界大战的可能性是存在的，但是决不能说“现在可以永远消灭战争”，决不能说“现在已经有了从现代社会生活中根本消灭任何战争的现实可能性”，更不能说“人类已经进入永久和平的时代了”。散布任何不切实际的和平幻想，都只会麻痹人民群众，有利于帝国主义准备新战争的阴谋，而不利于世界和平事业的。
    在裁军问题上，社会主义国家和帝国主义国家的不同态度，反映了两种社会制度的不同的对外政策。帝国主义总是把武力作为推行它的对外政策的工具。与此相反，社会主义国家一贯主张以和平协商方式来解决国际问题，主张社会制度不同的国家和平共处。但是，面对着全副武装的野心勃勃的以美国为首的帝国主义集团，社会主义国家完全有必要保持高度的警惕和加强自己的武装力量，以保卫社会主义祖国，保卫世界和平。当然，只要有可能，我们总是主张裁减军备，以和缓国际紧张局势。对于苏联政府过去的争取实现裁军的努力，中国人民一贯给予支持。中国政府并曾声明，中国从来毫不犹豫地承担它所承担的一切国际义务。但是，没有中华人民共和国正式参加和它的代表签字，有关裁军的国际协议和其他一切国际协议，当然都不能对中国具有任何约束力。
    苏联提出的新裁军建议，应当是对世界各国人民加强争取和平斗争的又一号召。各国人民争取裁军的斗争，就是揭露和反对帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义疯狂地进行扩军备战活动的斗争。这场斗争，正日益广泛地动员全世界的和平力量，有力地打击着美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策。社会主义各国人民一直站在这个斗争的最前列。在美国和其他资本主义国家中，越来越多的人再也不能忍受强加在他们身上的沉重的军费负担，强烈地反对美帝国主义的战争政策。在那些被绑在美国战车上的国家里，越来越多的人民群众认识到美帝国主义把他们的国家拖向何等危险的境地，纷纷反对他们的政府为美国“火中取栗”。如果能够实现普遍的裁军，对于各国人民是有利的。但是，战争是同帝国主义本性分不开的，美帝国主义的战争政策并没有改变。因此，各国人民必须加强斗争，不断地揭露美帝国主义的扩军备战活动，打击它阻挠裁军、破坏和平的一切阴谋。我国政府的声明指出：“只有经过世界各国人民坚持不懈的斗争，最大限度地孤立以美国为首的帝国主义，才有可能迫使帝国主义国家坐下来进行认真的裁军谈判，才有可能推迟以至制止帝国主义发动新的世界大战的计划，才有可能使世界和平得到保障。”各国人民应当进一步动员起来，展开一个更大规模的反对美国扩军备战和保障世界和平的斗争。
