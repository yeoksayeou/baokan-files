    "Hindustan Standard" believes: Opposing the Japan-U.S. treaty is not beneficial to the Japanese people; American military occupation is greatly beneficial to Japan.
    Xinhua News Agency, 18th: New Delhi Dispatch: Contrary to the people of the world and just public opinion, some newspapers in India are defending the U.S.-Japan reactionaries and the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" they concluded, and even openly insulting the heroic struggle of the Japanese people.
    The "Hindustan Standard" reverses black and white and says that the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" "does not mean any further damage to Japan's sovereignty," and "it is difficult to see what benefits preventing the ratification of the new treaty would bring to the Japanese people." The newspaper also said that to abolish all foreign military bases in Japan "seems impossible."
    This Indian newspaper even openly praises the U.S. imperialism's occupation of Japan. It actually says, "If it were not for the American occupation in the years after World War II, the Japanese people may not have been able to achieve the degree of democratic self-confidence manifested in the recent anti-government demonstrations." It even said that during the American occupation, "there were revolutionary changes in Japan's social, economic, and political life."
    The Urdu "Daily Glory" on the 18th said with ulterior motives that the Kishi Nobusuke government knew that "it could not confront China and Russia on its own, and was therefore naturally forced to conclude military treaties with other countries."
    The "Indian Express" in today's editorial slandered the Japanese people's anti-American demonstrations as "part of an international red movement." At the same time, it clamored that if the "free" world wants to maintain the cause of "democracy," it must form a "united front" to deal with the "totalitarian world" represented by Moscow and Beijing.

    为谁捧场为谁忙
    “印度斯坦旗报”认为：反对日美条约对日本人民没有好处，美国军事占领对日本倒有很大利益
    新华社18日讯　新德里消息：同全世界人民和公正舆论相反，印度的一些报纸却为美日反动派和它们缔结的新日美“安全条约”辩解，甚至公然侮辱英勇斗争的日本人民。
    “印度斯坦旗报”颠倒黑白地说，日美“安全条约”“并不意味着对日本主权的任何进一步损害”，“很难看出，阻止批准新条约，对日本人民有什么好处”。这家报纸还说，要取消在日本的一切外国军事基地“看来是不可能的”。
    这家印度报纸甚至公然吹捧美帝国主义对日本的占领。它竟说，
  “要不是因为美国在第二次世界大战后若干年的占领，日本人也许就不可能达到表现在最近反政府的示威中的那种程度的民主自信心。”它甚至说，在美国占领期间，“日本的社会、经济和政治生活中有着革命性的改变”。
    乌尔都文的“荣耀日报”18日别有用心地说什么岸信介政府知道“不能单靠自己来对抗中国和俄国，因此自然地被迫同其它国家缔结军事条约”。
    “印度快报”在今天的社论中诬蔑日本人民的反美示威是什么“国际赤色举动的一部分”。同时，它叫嚣，“自由”世界如果要维护“民主”事业，必须结成“统一阵线”，来对付莫斯科和北京所代表的“极权世界”。
