Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 17th: Japanese Socialist Party Chairman Inejiro Asanuma met with Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi this evening, firmly demanding that the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet resign en masse or dissolve the Diet before the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" "naturally comes into effect" on the 18th.

    Asanuma said during the meeting, "Currently, Japan's parliament and democracy are in crisis. If the Prime Minister considers his responsibility and the domestically turbulent atmosphere, resignation or dissolution of the Diet is only natural."

    Asanuma believes that the conditions for dissolving the Diet are already in place. For example, outside the Diet, voices demanding the resignation of Nobusuke Kishi are everywhere; petitions expressing opposition to the "Security Treaty" have reached 20 million, etc. He said that holding a general election at this time is only natural.

    Asanuma also pointed out: The new "Security Treaty" did not make a complete resolution in the House of Representatives. The House of Councillors has never had an example of "natural enactment." The Kishi Nobusuke government's actions are invalid.

    In response, Nobusuke Kishi insisted that he does not intend to step down "before resolving the security treaty issue" and said that "it is impossible to carry out a collective resignation or dissolve the Diet on the 18th and 19th."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 17th: The Japanese Socialist Party issued a statement today regarding the stabbing of the party's advisor, Jotaro Kawakami, by a right-wing thug, demanding that the Nobusuke Kishi government be held responsible. The statement said that today we received a report that many right-wing thugs would go to the vicinity of the Diet to commit violence, therefore, from the morning, we repeatedly suggested that the Metropolitan Police Department carry out strict precautions. However, this unfortunate incident finally occurred. This is undoubtedly negligence on the part of the Metropolitan Police Department and there is suspicion of collusion between the Metropolitan Police Department and right-wing violent groups.

    The statement said that this incident exposed the fascist face of the Nobusuke Kishi government. The statement said that because the incident occurred within the Diet, we must also hold the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Ichiro Kiyose, responsible.

    日本社会党委员长浅沼同岸信介会谈
    坚决要求岸政府立即总辞职
    社会党要追究岸政府对河上被刺事件的责任
    新华社17日讯　东京消息：日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎今天晚间同日本首相岸信介举行会谈，坚决要求岸信介内阁在新日美“安全条约”“自然成立”以前的18日实行总辞职或者解散国会。
    浅沼在会谈中说：“目前，日本的议会和民主已经陷于危机中，假如首相考虑自己的责任和国内动荡不安的空气，辞职或者解散国会是理所当然的。”
    浅沼认为，解散国会已经具备了各种条件，如在国会外面，到处都是要求岸信介下台的声音；请愿表示反对“安全条约”的人已经达到二千万等，他说，在这个时候，举行大选是理所当然的。
    浅沼还指出：新“安全条约”在众议院并没有作出完全的决议。参议院也从来没有过“自然成立”的例子。岸信介政府这样做是无效的。
    岸信介在答复时坚持说，“在解决安全条约问题以前”他不打算下台，并且说，“要在十八、十九两天实行全体辞职或者解散国会，那是办不到的”。
    新华社17日讯东京消息：日本社会党今天就这个党的顾问河上丈太郎被右翼暴力分子刺伤事件发表声明，要求追究岸信介政府的责任。声明说，今天接到报告说将有不少右翼暴力分子前往国会附近行凶，因此，从上午我们屡次提议警视厅进行森严戒备。但是像这种不幸事件终于发生了。这无疑是警视厅的怠慢，同时有警视厅和右翼暴力团体同谋的嫌疑。
    声明说，这件事情暴露了岸信介政府的法西斯面目。声明说，因为事件发生在国会境内，我们也要追究众议院议长清濑一郎的责任。
