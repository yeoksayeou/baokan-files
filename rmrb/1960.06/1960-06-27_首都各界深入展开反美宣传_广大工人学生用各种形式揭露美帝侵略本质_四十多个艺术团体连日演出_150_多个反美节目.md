Xinhua News Agency, June 25th: The activities of the "Anti-US Imperialism Aggression, Resolutely Liberate Taiwan, Defend World Peace Propaganda Week" are being deeply carried out among the broad masses of workers and students in Beijing.

　　During the propaganda week, employees of various factories and mines not only strike the enemy hard with greater and more outstanding production achievements, but also actively and enthusiastically devote themselves to creation and singing activities, using literary and artistic weapons to thoroughly expose the aggressive nature of US imperialism and conduct propaganda among the broad masses. The Beijing Finance and Trade System Employees' Amateur Art Troupe created and rehearsed fourteen programs, including clapper talk, crosstalk, and living newspaper plays, in just one and a half days. Employees of the Beijing Xinhua Printing Factory used more than 200 works such as poems, cartoons, clapper talk, and living newspaper plays to severely attack US imperialism. The Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory performed a living newspaper play "The Plague God's Embarrassment," created by the workers' amateur creation group, at a factory-wide demonstration against US imperialism. When the war criminal Eisenhower appeared on stage to "visit" the Philippines, Taiwan, and South Korea, the audience erupted with the slogan "Eisenhower, the ‘Plague God,’ get back home from the Philippines, from our territory Taiwan, from South Korea!" The Beijing Railway Bureau's various offices have organized literary and art propaganda teams to conduct propaganda at the grassroots level. Employees of the Beijing Ivory Carving Factory and other factories, as well as amateur art groups, are actively creating and rehearsing various programs in preparation for more in-depth propaganda activities.

　　Workers in various factories have published a large number of articles, poems, and paintings on factory newspapers and blackboards with the theme of "Oppose US Imperialism Aggression, Resolutely Liberate Taiwan, Defend World Peace." Many factories have picture exhibition windows displaying pictures exposing the true face of US imperialism's aggression.

　　Teachers and students from Renmin University of China, Peking University, and the Central Conservatory of Music actively participated in the propaganda week activities. Students sang war songs and used various forms of propaganda to expose, satirize, and condemn the aggressive conspiracy of Eisenhower, the number one war criminal of US imperialism. Each department, grade, and class of Renmin University of China performed entertainment programs against US imperialist aggression. The school's library also held a picture exhibition to expose the aggressive crimes of US imperialism. Teachers and students of the Central Conservatory of Music eagerly plunged into the creative and performance activities of the anti-US imperialism movement. The Composition Department and the Musicology Department created 78 lyrics and more than 200 songs overnight. Zhang Qingfu, a student of Renmin University of China who had personally taught US imperialism a lesson in the War of Liberation and the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, said at a meeting: "The Chinese people know how to teach this paper tiger a lesson. If it dares to launch a new war, it will be completely defeated!" Peking University students also wrote letters to support the just struggle of Japanese students against US imperialism and expressed extreme indignation at the Kishi Nobusuke clique, fostered by US imperialism, for slaughtering patriotic student Michiko Kamba.

　　According to this newspaper, over the past few days, more than forty art troupes in the capital have performed more than 150 new and retained programs against US imperialist aggression in theaters, squares, parks, streets, and radio stations, receiving a strong response from the angry and indignant audience. The audience used ridicule, slogans, and thunderous applause to express their contempt and disdain for US imperialism and their determination to fight against US imperialist aggression.

　　In more than thirty large and small theaters, large-scale programs such as the Peking Opera "Storm in the Pacific," the Ping Opera "The East Wind Prevails Over the West Wind," and the drama "The Roar of the People of Taiwan" were performed. Before the performances, a large number of living newspaper plays such as "The Bandit's Journey," "The Plague God's Eastern Tour," "The Madman in the White House," and "Anti-American Fury" were added, which were warmly welcomed by the audience. Since the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army began performing anti-US programs in various forms such as music, dance, living newspaper plays, and folk art at the Zhongshan Park Concert Hall on the 23rd, the huge concert hall has been packed. Whenever the "Anti-US Storm Chorus" reached an excited point, many audience members could not help but stand up and shout slogans with the performers: "Oppose US Imperialism, Defend World Peace!"

　　The famous plays "Strike the Aggressors," "Long Live the Heroes," "On the 38th Parallel," and "Steel Transport Soldiers," which depict the glorious historical facts of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, have been performed again and have been sold out every night.

　　In order to widely and deeply carry out the propaganda activities against US imperialism, literary and art workers in Beijing and from other places who came to Beijing to perform demonstrated a high degree of political enthusiasm and energy. When the Fourth Troupe of the China Peking Opera Theatre and the Experimental Peking Opera Troupe of the China Opera School were creating the Peking Opera living newspaper "Storm in the Pacific," the young actors worked hard and creatively used Peking Opera water flags, somersaults, and other martial arts techniques in the scene and dance design to vividly and symbolically depict Eisenhower in the front line of Fujian amid the "welcoming" gun sounds, and disoriented and embarrassed in the stormy waves of the Pacific and the people of the world opposing US imperialism. The China Ping Opera Theatre has recently created more than forty short programs against US imperialism in succession. While performing the large-scale opera "Strike the Aggressors," the Central Experimental Opera House actively created and rehearsed many new programs. Actors such as Guo Lanying and Wang Kun repeatedly practiced the small chorus "Eisenhower, I Ask You." This song, with a Henan Opera melody, accused Eisenhower's heinous crimes with passionate anger. The actors of the Beijing Quyi Troupe all took action to create, paying close attention to the actions of US imperialism and creating many new programs in a timely manner. When Hagerty was trapped in Tokyo, they compiled and performed "The Sadness of the Front Station"; when our heroic artillerymen on the Fujian front drove away the "Plague God," the actors immediately created the Western River Drum "Sending Eisenhower to His Funeral." When these programs were performed, the audience kept applauding and cheering. Many audience members also asked the actors for scripts to perform in their own units and expand the propaganda effect.

　　The Shandong Lu Opera Research Institute's Lu Opera Troupe, the Hunan Drama Troupe, the Sichuan Song and Dance Troupe, the Changchun Acrobatic Troupe and other art troupes from other places who came to Beijing to perform also enthusiastically participated in various performance activities of the "Anti-US Imperialism Aggression, Resolutely Liberate Taiwan, Defend World Peace Propaganda Week."

    据新华社25日讯　北京市广大工人、学生中“反对美帝侵略、坚决解放台湾、保卫世界和平宣传周”的各项活动正在深入开展。
    各厂矿企业职工在宣传周里不仅以更大的、出色的生产成绩来狠狠地打击敌人，并且积极、热烈地投入创作演唱活动，用文艺武器，彻底揭露美帝的侵略本质，向广大群众进行宣传，北京市财贸系统职工业余文工团仅在短短的一天半时间内，就创作和排练了快板、相声、活报剧等十四个节目。北京新华印刷厂职工运用诗、漫画、快板和活报剧等二百多件作品，狠狠地打击美帝国主义。北京第一棉纺织厂在全厂反对美帝国主义示威大会上演出了工人业余创作小组创作的活报剧“瘟神洋相”，当台上出现战争贩子艾森豪威尔到菲律宾、台湾和南朝鲜“访问”时，台下爆发出“艾
  ‘瘟神’从菲律宾、从我国领土台湾、从南朝鲜滚回老家去”的口号声。北京铁路局各办事处都组织了文艺宣传队到各基层进行宣传。北京象牙雕刻厂等厂职工和业余文艺团体正在积极创作和排练各种节目，准备进行更深入的宣传活动。
    各工厂的工人在工厂的小报和黑板报上，以“反对美帝侵略、坚决解放台湾、保卫世界和平”为题，发表了大量文章和诗画。不少工厂有图片展览窗，展出了暴露美帝侵略真面目的图片。
    中国人民大学、北京大学和中央音乐学院师生积极投入宣传周的活动。同学们高唱战歌，以各种宣传形式揭露、讽刺、谴责美帝国主义头号战争贩子艾森豪威尔的侵略阴谋。中国人民大学各系、级、班都演出了反对美帝侵略的文娱节目。学校的图书馆并举办了图片展览揭露美帝国主义的侵略罪行。中央音乐学院师生，个个摩拳擦掌地投入反美帝国主义运动的创作和演出活动。作曲系和音乐学系连夜创作歌词七十八首，歌曲二百余首。中国人民大学学生、曾在解放战争和抗美援朝战争中亲手教训过美帝国主义的复员转业军人张庆福在一次会上说：“中国人民是知道怎样教训这只纸老虎的，如果他胆敢发动新战争，就把它彻底打败！”北京大学学生还写信支持日本学生的反美帝国主义的正义斗争，并对美帝国主义豢养的岸信介集团屠杀爱国学生桦美智子表示万分愤慨。
    本报讯　首都四十多个艺术团体连日来在剧场、广场、公园、街头、广播电台演出了一百五十多个反对美帝国主义侵略的新节目和保留剧目，得到怒火填膺的广大观众的强烈反应。观众们用嘲笑声、口号声和雷动的掌声，表示自己鄙视、蔑视美帝的心情和反对美帝侵略的斗争意志。
    三十几个大小剧场里，演出了京剧“太平洋的风暴”、评剧“东风压倒西风”、话剧“台湾人民的怒吼”等大型剧目。演出之前都加演了“强盗旅行”、“瘟神东游记”、“白宫的疯子”、“反美怒潮”等大批活报剧，受到观众的热烈欢迎。解放军总政文工团23日起在中山公园音乐堂演出音乐、舞蹈、活报、曲艺等多种形式的反对美帝节目以来，庞大的音乐堂座无虚席。每当“反对美帝风暴大合唱”演唱到激愤之处，许多观众情不自禁地起立和演员们一起高呼口号：“反对美帝国主义，保卫世界和平！”
