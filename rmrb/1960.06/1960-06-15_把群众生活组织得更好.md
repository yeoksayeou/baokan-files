    Organizing the Masses' Life Better
    Chen Jinrong, First Secretary of the CPC 克东 (Kèdōng) County Committee, Heilongjiang
    After more than eight years of effort in 克东 (Kèdōng) County, Heilongjiang Province, the rural welfare work has been vigorously developed and blossomed everywhere. The county has basically achieved that every commune has a health center, maternal and child health station, and home for the elderly; every district has a maternity hospital, health clinic, bathhouse, and barbershop; and every team has a canteen, nursery, kindergarten, and service station, forming a welfare network centered on the canteen throughout the county.
    Everything from eating, clothing, fuel, and utensils to housing, from dismantling, sewing, washing, and mending to weddings, funerals, and marriages, from birth, aging, illness, and death, and all household chores have been contracted by the society. The low and dilapidated houses in the countryside have been continuously renovated and repaired, and vigorous efforts have been made to eliminate pests and diseases. The county has basically eliminated the four pests, controlled the 克山 (Kèshān) disease which seriously endangers people's health, and carried out the prevention and treatment of trachoma and the large-scale expulsion of human tapeworms. The old way of life has been replaced by a new way of life, realizing the socialization of housework and the collectivization of life. The emerging welfare institutions have converged into a surging torrent, fiercely washing away all the traces left over from the old society with their vigorous vitality and unparalleled superiority, and drastically changing the political, economic, cultural, and living aspects of the entire society. Therefore, there has emerged a new scene of great leaps forward in industrial and agricultural production, increased purchasing power, improved people's lives, and great changes in sanitation, with abundant harvests, longevity, thriving livestock, and prosperity.
    As early as more than twenty years ago, our great leader Chairman Mao told us to care about the people's lives and pay attention to working methods. After the realization of the people's commune, the Party Central Committee repeatedly instructed us: the greater the enthusiasm of the masses, the more the Party should care about the people's lives; the more the Party cares about the people's lives, the greater the enthusiasm of the masses will be, and we must pay attention to comprehensively grasping ideology, production, and life. According to the instructions of the Party, the county committee, on the one hand, led the broad masses of commune members to actively do a good job in production, and on the other hand, earnestly organized the people's economic life and strengthened the leadership over rural collective welfare work.
    Vigorously developing rural collective welfare undertakings is not only related to the vital interests of the masses, but also something that the masses have strong desires and urgent demands for. As long as we earnestly mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, make use of local conditions and resources, and launch a mass movement, many practical problems can be readily solved. In the process of running welfare undertakings, the broad masses of commune members unanimously expressed: "Collective welfare is for everyone, everyone is responsible for building it; whatever is lacking, as long as we have it, we will use whatever we have; we will vacate our houses if we can, and take out our things if we can; if we have no houses or things, we will contribute labor, and jointly cultivate the flowers of welfare." The masses voluntarily lent various wood, houses, and other materials, solving the problems of funds, wood, and houses; the nurseries and kindergartens lacked toys, so the rural Communist Youth League branch launched a movement for each member and youth to make a toy; the lack of talents in running welfare undertakings led everyone to use their hands and brains, striving to be local experts, and inventions and creations emerged endlessly. Due to the great development of production, collective welfare undertakings have also been continuously developed and improved, and the quality has been greatly improved, achieving diligent service, and thoughtful and comprehensive care. Therefore, the broad masses of commune members unanimously praised: "The Party's care is like parents, welfare undertakings are blooming, eating, clothing, fuel, and housing are all well thought out, the commune is stronger than our own family, we can wholeheartedly engage in production, and go all out to build the country."

    把群众生活组织得更好
    中共黑龙江克东县委第一书记　陈金荣
    黑龙江省克东县的农村生活福利工作，经过八年多的努力，农村生活福利事业已在全县蓬勃发展，遍地开花。全县基本达到了社社有卫生院、妇幼保健站、敬老院，区区有产院、保健室、浴池、理发所，队队有食堂、托儿所、幼儿园和服务站，在全县范围内构成了一个以食堂为中心的生活福利网。
    人们从吃、穿、烧、用、住到拆、缝、洗、浆、补，从婚、丧、嫁、娶到生、老、病、死等一切家务琐事，已由社会全部承包下来。农村中的低矮破漏的房屋已进行了不断的改造，整修，并大力进行了除害灭病工作。全县基本消灭了四害，控制了严重危害人民身体健康的克山病，开展了防治砂眼、大驱人身条虫工作。旧的生活方式已被新的生活方式所代替，实现了家务劳动社会化和生活集体化。新兴的福利机构，汇成一股汹涌澎湃的巨流，以其旺盛的生命力和无比的优越性，猛烈地冲刷着旧社会残留下来的一切斑痕，急剧地改变着整个社会的政治、经济、文化和生活的面貌。因此，出现了工农业生产大跃进，购买力提高，人民生活改善，卫生面貌大改观的五谷丰登，人寿年丰，六畜兴旺，欣欣向荣的新景象。
    早在二十多年前，我们伟大的领袖毛主席就告诉我们要关心群众生活，注意工作方法。实现人民公社化以后，党中央又一再指示我们：群众的干劲越大，党越要关心群众生活；党越是关心群众生活，群众的干劲也会越大，必须注意全面地抓思想、抓生产、抓生活。县委根据党的指示，一方面领导广大社员积极搞好生产，一方面又认真地组织人民经济生活，加强了对农村集体生活福利工作的领导。
    大办农村集体生活福利事业，既关系到群众的切身利益，又是群众抱有强烈愿望和迫切要求的事情。只要认真发动群众，依靠群众，因陋就简，大搞群众运动，许多实际问题就可迎刃而解。在兴办福利事业中，广大社员一致表示说：“集体福利为大家，人人有责建设它；缺啥只要我们有，用啥我们就拿啥；使房我们就给腾，用物我们就给拿；没房没物出人力，共同栽培福利花。”群众自动借出各种木料、房屋和其他物资解决了资金、木料、房屋等问题；托儿所和幼儿园缺少玩具，农村共青团支部就开展了每个团员和青年做一样玩具的运动；兴办福利事业缺少人材，就人人动手动脑，争当土专家，发明创造层出不穷。由于生产的大发展，集体生活福利事业也得到了不断的发展和完善，质量大大提高，作到了殷勤服务，周到全面。因此，广大社员一致赞扬说：“党的关怀像爹妈，福利事业开红花，吃穿烧住想周到，公社强于自己家，一心无挂搞生产，鼓足干劲建国家。”
