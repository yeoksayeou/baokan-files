Xinhua News Agency, June 8th: More than 1,500 people from all walks of life in the capital held a grand meeting this afternoon to warmly welcome the Japanese literary delegation headed by Hiroshi Noma and resolutely support the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle against the United States. A huge banner hung in the venue read: "Drive U.S. Imperialism Back Home!" "Salute to the Heroic Japanese People!"

This meeting was jointly organized by the Chinese Committee for Asian-African Solidarity, the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, The China National Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the Chinese Writers Association. Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, delivered the opening remarks on behalf of the four organizations, warmly welcoming the friends of the Japanese literary delegation who came to our country for a visit, bringing with them the fraternal fighting friendship of the Japanese people to the Chinese people. He said: "At present, the anti-U.S. and patriotic struggle of the Japanese people is surging, wave after wave fiercely impacting the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and achieving a series of victories, severely hitting the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression in the Far East and greatly encouraging the struggles of people of all countries against U.S. imperialism."

He condemned the desperate Eisenhower, who, disregarding the firm opposition of the Japanese people and the serious protests of peace-loving people all over the world, decided to visit Japan as scheduled and continue to pursue his aggressive war policy in the Far East. He said: Eisenhower is the number one war-monger and the most ferocious imperialist head. We must not harbor any unrealistic illusions about him. To defeat such an enemy, we must mainly rely on the people to unite and wage a resolute struggle. The 650 million Chinese people have always regarded supporting the Japanese people's just struggle as their sacred duty, regarded the Japanese people's struggle as their own struggle, and resolutely and unswervingly give their support.

Chu Tunan finally said, "With the firm support of the people of all countries, the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle against the United States will surely continue to advance! Continue to win victories!"

Mao Dun, Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, spoke. He talked about the great world significance of the Japanese people's anti-U.S. patriotic movement and enthusiastically expressed: The 650 million Chinese people will always firmly support the Japanese people's struggle for an independent, democratic, peaceful, and neutral Japan! (Mao Dun's speech will be issued separately)

The audience warmly welcomed the speech by Hiroshi Noma, head of the Japanese literary delegation. Noma Hiroshi gave a detailed introduction to the Japanese people's anti-U.S. patriotic struggle. He said: "The Japanese and Chinese people must form a united front to oppose the common enemy - U.S. imperialism; and overthrow it in this struggle." Noma Hiroshi strongly condemned Eisenhower's planned visit to Japan. He said, "The Japanese people are determined not to let Eisenhower set foot on Japanese soil." (Noma Hiroshi's speech will be issued separately)

Japanese literary delegation members Katsuiro Kamei and Yoko Matsuoka also spoke at the welcome meeting. In his speech, Katsuiro Kamei pointed out that from the forced passage of the so-called Japan-U.S. Security Treaty to Eisenhower's planned visit to Japan, "it shows that Kishi Nobusuke has completely betrayed the Japanese people and sold Japan to the United States." He condemned the evil consequences caused by Japan under the control of U.S. imperialism in various aspects, pointing out that to eliminate these evil consequences, the Japanese people need to abolish U.S. military bases, withdraw U.S. troops from Japan, and get rid of the rule of U.S. financial capital. He said that the Japanese people "must use their own strength to build a truly independent, peace-loving, and happy country with a stable life." He emphasized that the people of Japan and China must establish a united front to jointly oppose the most ferocious enemy in the world today - U.S. imperialism. In her speech, Yoko Matsuoka vividly depicted the situation of the Japanese people's anti-U.S. patriotic struggle. She said: "The Japanese people have hope, and our struggle has a future." She said: "For us, the most important thing is not to relax the struggle for a moment." "Our struggle is becoming increasingly acute, but we must never, and should never, go downhill." She finally said: "We will resolutely fight to the end until we completely sweep the stinking things out of Japan."

All the speeches at the conference were warmly welcomed.

Other members of the Japanese literary delegation: Minoru Takeuchi, Takehiro Kaikō, Kenzaburō Ōe, Saburō Shiroto, Japanese painting delegation Deputy Head Hitoshi Shiraishi and members, Japanese peace personage in Beijing Kinkazu Saionji, Korean peace personage Hwang Bong-koo, Sudanese peace personage Khair, etc., were all invited to participate in the meeting.

    首都盛会欢迎日本文学家代表团
    楚图南和茅盾说：中国人民永远支持日本人民正义斗争
    日本友人说：日中人民要携手反对共同敌人美帝国主义
    据新华社8日讯　首都各界人民一千五百多人今天下午举行盛大集会，热烈欢迎以野间宏为首的日本文学家代表团，坚决支持日本人民反美爱国的正义斗争。会场上悬挂的巨幅大标语上写着：“把美帝国主义赶回老家去！”“向英勇斗争的日本人民致敬！”
    这个大会是由中国亚非团结委员会、中国人民对外文化协会、中国文学艺术界联合会和中国作家协会联合举办的。中国人民对外文化协会会长楚图南代表四团体致开会词，热烈欢迎带着日本人民对中国人民的兄弟战斗友谊来到我国访问的日本文学家代表团的朋友们。他说：“目前，日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争浪潮，正波澜壮阔，一浪高过一浪地向着美日反动派猛烈地冲击，并且取得了一系列的胜利，严重地打击了美帝国主义在远东的侵略政策，大大地鼓舞了各国人民反对美帝国主义的斗争。”
    他谴责日暮途穷的艾森豪威尔不顾日本全国人民的坚决反对和全世界爱好和平人民的严重抗议，竟然决定如期访问日本，继续在远东推行它的侵略战争政策。他说：艾森豪威尔是天字第一号战争贩子，是最凶恶的帝国主义的头子，对他绝对不能抱有任何不切实际的幻想。要战胜这样的敌人，主要依靠人民团结一致，进行坚决的斗争。六亿五千万中国人民一向把支持日本人民的正义斗争看成是自己的神圣义务，把日本人民的斗争看成是自己的斗争，始终不渝地坚决给予支持。
    楚图南最后说，“在各国人民的坚决支持下，日本人民的反美爱国正义斗争，一定能够继续迈进！继续胜利！”
    中国作家协会主席茅盾讲话。他谈到了日本人民反美爱国运动的伟大世界意义，并热情表示：六亿五千万中国人民永远坚决支持日本人民为独立、民主、和平、中立的日本而进行的斗争！（茅盾的讲话另发）
    全场热烈欢迎日本文学家代表团团长野间宏讲话。野间宏详细介绍了日本人民反美爱国斗争的情况。他说：“日本人民和中国人民要结成统一战线，反对共同的敌人——美帝国主义；在这个斗争中把它打倒。”野间宏强烈谴责艾森豪威尔将对日本的访问。他说，“日本人民下定决心，决不让艾森豪威尔跨上日本国土一步。”
  （野间宏的讲话另发）
    日本文学家代表团团员龟井胜一郎和松冈洋子也先后在欢迎大会上讲了话。龟井胜一郎在讲话中指出，从所谓日美安全条约的强行通过到艾森豪威尔将访问日本的计划，“都说明岸信介是完全背叛日本人民，将日本出卖给美国的”。他控诉了日本在美帝国主义控制下在各方面所造成的恶果，指出要清除这些恶果，日本人民就需要废除美军基地、美军撤出日本和摆脱美国金融资本的统治。他说，日本人民“要以自己的力量建立一个真正独立、维护和平和生活安定的幸福国家。他强调日中两国人民要建立统一战线，共同反对目前世界上最凶暴的敌人——美帝国主义。松冈洋子在讲话中生动地描绘了日本人民反美爱国斗争的情形。她说：“日本人民是有希望的，我们的斗争是有前途的。”她说：“对我们来说，最重要的是一刻也不能放松斗争。”“我们的斗争日益尖锐了，但是我们绝对不能也不应该走下坡路。”她最后说：“我们坚决斗争到底，一直到把臭的东西彻底的扫出日本。”
    大会上的所有讲话都受到了热烈的欢迎。
    日本文学家代表团的其他成员：竹内实、开高健、大江健三郎、白土吾夫，日本画家代表团副团长白石凡和团员，在京的日本和平人士西园寺公一、朝鲜和平人士黄凤九、苏丹和平人士凯尔等，都应邀参加了大会。
