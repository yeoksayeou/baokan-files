Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The Ministry of Education recently issued the "Regulations on Enrollment of New Students in Higher Education Institutions in 1960." The full text is as follows:

The enrollment work of higher education institutions in 1960 should continue to implement the class line under the leadership of the Party committees at all levels, and in accordance with the policy of developing education with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, actively tap potential, make every effort to expand student sources, ensure priorities, and strive to overfulfill the enrollment tasks. The principle of admitting new students should be: ensuring political quality, combined with the candidates' academic performance and health conditions, and selecting the best.

In accordance with the above principles, the following regulations are made for the enrollment work of higher education institutions this summer:

I. The enrollment of higher education institutions adopts a combination of unified leadership and decentralized handling, basically with provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions as units for handling enrollment work. Under the leadership of the provincial, municipal, and autonomous region Party committees and people's committees, the education departments (bureaus) and higher education bureaus (departments) of each province, municipality, and autonomous region, in conjunction with relevant departments, organize the higher education institutions in their provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions to establish enrollment agencies, and uniformly handle all enrollment work in their provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in accordance with these regulations and relevant enrollment work arrangements.

Key higher education institutions and other higher education institutions under the leadership of central departments adopt a nationally unified enrollment method. The enrollment methods of other higher education institutions are determined by the provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions themselves. They can participate in the nationally unified enrollment, or they can conduct separate enrollment after the nationally unified enrollment.

Art and sports colleges (including art and sports departments of normal colleges) have special requirements for students. In addition to subject examinations, they must also conduct practical skills examinations. Therefore, art or sports colleges of the same nature can jointly handle enrollment work in advance under the unified leadership of the provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions.

Some higher education institutions that run preparatory courses or five-year vocational programs and need to recruit junior high school graduates can handle enrollment work together with local senior high schools. The specific methods shall be determined by the relevant departments and the provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions themselves.

All higher education institutions should carry out enrollment work under the unified leadership of the local Party committees and enrollment agencies.

II. In addition to recruiting senior high school graduates and other candidates, higher education institutions should also recruit a portion of on-the-job workers, cadres, and commune members from factories, mines, enterprises, farms, state organs, and people's communes. The political and health conditions of these students should also meet the prescribed standards; their cultural level must be qualified by the accepting school's test (able to keep up with classes after enrollment).

III. Any citizen of the People's Republic of China who has a senior high school diploma or equivalent cultural level, is under the age of thirty (the age for workers, peasants, demobilized and transferred soldiers, and on-the-job cadres can be appropriately relaxed by the local authorities), and meets one of the following conditions can apply to take the entrance examination for higher education institutions:

(6) Other educated youth, holding a certificate from the people's commune or people's committee above the district level.

IV. Schools participating in the nationally unified enrollment will hold examinations in three categories according to the different nature of the enrolled majors. The examination subjects are as follows:

(1) All science and engineering majors (including geography departments of normal colleges and natural geography majors of comprehensive universities), majors in agricultural mechanization, agricultural meteorology, land planning, agricultural physics, agricultural chemistry, agricultural electricity, agricultural machinery design and manufacturing, farmland water conservancy, food processing, livestock product processing, forest logging and transportation, forest area road construction, timber water transport, timber mechanical processing, forest product chemical processing, forest management machinery manufacturing, timber processing machinery manufacturing, forest logging and transport machinery manufacturing, industrial fishing, fishery machinery, and aquatic product processing in agricultural and forestry colleges; pharmacy majors in medical colleges, biophysics, and biochemistry majors, examination subjects: Chinese, politics, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and foreign language.

(3) All majors in literature, history, political science, law, economics, and art, economic geography majors in comprehensive universities, examination subjects: Chinese, politics, history, and foreign language.

Candidates applying for economics majors, economic geography majors, and philosophy majors must take an additional mathematics test (professional cadres engaged in financial and economic work can apply for exemption from the mathematics test when applying for economics majors). Additional examination subjects for art, sports, and other majors (departments) with special requirements shall be determined by the relevant departments and schools themselves.

Foreign languages include Russian and English. Candidates can choose one based on their studies when taking the examination. Those who have not studied a foreign language can apply for exemption. Candidates applying for foreign language majors cannot apply for exemption.

The examination subjects for other schools that do not participate in the nationally unified enrollment shall be determined by the provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions themselves with reference to the above regulations.

V. The entrance examinations for schools participating in the nationally unified enrollment will be held from July 20 to 22. The dates for the entrance examinations of other schools shall be determined by the provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, and relevant departments themselves.

VI. The number of students enrolled by higher education institutions under the central departments in each province, municipality, and autonomous region shall be formulated and allocated by the Ministry of Education.

The names of higher education institutions and departments (majors) enrolling students in each province, municipality, and autonomous region shall be announced by each province, municipality, and autonomous region.

VII. The examination areas and examination rooms for enrollment in various types of higher education institutions shall be determined and announced by the provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions.

IX. In principle, all expenses required for various types of candidates to apply for higher education institutions shall be borne by themselves. The travel expenses to the school after admission shall be paid by the work unit (school) for on-the-job personnel, transferred soldiers, and this year's graduates of secondary vocational schools; other new students should, in principle, bear their own expenses, and those who are indeed unable to raise travel expenses due to the long distance to the school and family financial difficulties may apply for subsidies from the education administrative departments or enrollment agencies of the provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions where they are located.

X. Higher education institutions should conduct political and health re-examinations immediately after the new students enroll. Those who fail the re-examination will have their admission qualifications revoked. However, if the medical unit diagnoses that new students who fail the health re-examination can meet the health examination standards for new students admitted to higher education institutions after a short period of recuperation and treatment, the school may consider granting them the right to retain their admission qualifications for one year.

XI. The enrollment agencies of each province, municipality, and autonomous region and the schools that jointly enroll students in advance should formulate and announce enrollment brochures separately based on these regulations and in conjunction with the specific conditions of the province, municipality, autonomous region, and school.
