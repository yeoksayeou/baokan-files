Xinhua News Agency report: Shaanxi Province's summer harvest has entered its busiest period. In the Guanzhong and Han River plains, as well as the Qinling and Bashan mountainous areas, there is a busy scene of rushing to harvest everywhere. As of May 31, the province has harvested more than 5,824,400 mu of wheat, summer coarse grains, and rapeseed. At present, all parts of the province are closely monitoring the ripening of wheat and changes in the climate, harvesting as it ripens, and the progress is very fast. Manychuan Commune in Shanyang County in the Qinling Mountains has already harvested and weighed 619 mu of hillside wheat, with an average yield per mu increasing by more than 60% compared to last year. The Zhujiawan Production Team of the Wuli Commune in Ankang County in southern Shaanxi harvested 31.5 mu of hillside barley, with an average yield per mu doubling compared to last year.

Shaanxi's summer harvest this year was achieved by overcoming various natural disasters. The province's summer harvest crops suffered from drought ever since planting last year, and wheat stripe rust and pests such as wheat spider mites, aphids, and wheat midges were also more severe than in recent years. However, under the leadership of the Party, the people of the province declared war on the drought, put forward the bold slogan of ensuring a bumper harvest without rain, and launched a tenacious struggle against drought, overcoming the spread of pests and diseases time and again. Due to the large-scale water conservancy projects built to combat drought, many drylands and sandy wheat fields that had no water sources in the past were able to extract groundwater for irrigation, thus achieving a bumper harvest.

In previous years, Shaanxi's summer harvest was generally carried out in sequence from south to north and from east to west. Wheat in western Guanzhong matured about ten to fifteen days later than in the central part, and stubble wheat in various places also matured later than the first crop. However, this year, due to good management, the wheat grew uniformly, and the harvest period in Qian County and other places in western Guanzhong was roughly the same as in the central part; the late-maturing stubble wheat also matured at the same time as the first crop this year. Under these circumstances, in order to avoid losses due to over-ripening and grain shattering, various localities have promptly deployed harvesting forces, striving to harvest in a timely manner, quickly, carefully, and well, to ensure high yields and bumper harvests. To this end, a large number of non-agricultural laborers have been mobilized to support the summer harvest. In Xingping and four other counties alone, more than 350,000 people were mobilized to support the rush harvest. Provincial-level agencies, troops, and schools dispatched 18,000 cadres and organized two mechanical harvesting teams to help rush harvest in areas with more wheat fields and fewer laborers. Pucheng County transferred more than 800 cadres to serve as deputy team leaders in production teams, setting up the command post in the fields. As soon as the wheat ripened, they immediately organized a large-scale blitz combining harvesting, transportation, and stacking. In Hanzhong City, ten of the twelve secretaries and county heads went deep into the communes and teams to lead the summer harvest. Zhang Shucheng, the first secretary, found that the wheat in the Wuyi Production Team of the Zhongsuo Commune turned yellow all of a sudden, and immediately organized 900 commune members to rush the harvest, recovering all 1,200 mu of ripe wheat in one day and one night. In order to seize sunny days and avoid rainy days, various localities have also strengthened mass meteorological observation and forecasting work in order to rush the harvest in a timely manner.

Xinhua News Agency report: The mountainous areas of Guizhou, which had been suffering from prolonged drought, have recently received widespread welcome rains. The commune members of all ethnic groups in the province are taking advantage of this opportunity, with the joyful mood of "making good use of the precious water to fill granaries with grain," to vigorously intercept and store rainwater, while irrigating and preparing fields, and transplanting rice seedlings.

In order to ensure full planting and transplanting and to win a bumper grain harvest this year, the rural areas of the province are making rushing for water, preparing fields, and transplanting rice seedlings the central task that overrides everything else. In many areas, a moving scene has emerged: "A yellow patch in the morning, a pool of water at noon, and a patch of seedlings in the afternoon." After widespread heavy rains in the Bijie area, 630,000 people and 210,000 head of draft cattle were mobilized throughout the area on the 26th to rush for water. In one day, they irrigated and prepared more than 110,000 mu of fields and transplanted more than 80,000 mu of rice seedlings.

In order to solve the problem of insufficient labor, the people's communes are carrying out large-scale cooperation, centralizing and unifying the use of labor, and extensively promoting the use of rice transplanters. While the production teams in Zhijin County are carrying out five major collaborations based on the principle of equivalent exchange, such as labor, draft animals, farm tools, seedlings, and fertilizers, they have also organized a support army of 95,000 people and more than 3,000 head of draft cattle to go wherever assistance is needed, greatly accelerating the progress of irrigating fields, preparing fields, and transplanting seedlings throughout the county.

Guizhou's progress in rushing for water, preparing fields, and transplanting seedlings is fast and of high quality, especially in grasping several important links such as deep plowing, applying sufficient base fertilizer, and rational close planting. Generally, deep plowing in the fields is more than eight inches, achieving three plowings and three harrows.

After the widespread welcome rains, various localities resolutely implemented the provincial party committee's instructions of "machine transplanting as the main method and manual transplanting as the supplementary method." More than 200,000 rice transplanters throughout the province went into action to accelerate the progress of transplanting.

Xinhua News Agency report: Yunnan's field management of early rice has been done "early, well, carefully, and comprehensively." After overcoming the continuous six-month-long severe drought, as well as natural disasters such as insect pests and frost, at present, a bumper early rice harvest is in sight throughout the province, and harvesting has begun in the southern regions.

This spring, the climate in various parts of Yunnan was not normal. In the process of field management of early rice, commune members in various localities launched a tenacious struggle against natural disasters. Yuanjiang County in Yuxi Prefecture, which transplanted early rice the earliest, after completing the planting in December last year, did not receive a drop of rain until early May this year. The average temperature was between 38 and 40 degrees Celsius, and the evaporation rate was high. Just as the early rice was budding and heading, more than 5,000 mu of fields in the county were cracked by the sun. The commune members of this county, with the heroic spirit of "making the Red River climb the mountains," formed an anti-drought army of more than 15,000 people, installed 21 water pumps, 100 horse-drawn water carts, and tens of thousands of water-lifting tools along the Red River in ten days, and dug 500 wells and three 10-kilometer-long ditches to divert water for irrigation beside the dry rice fields, thereby ensuring that all drought-stricken early rice was irrigated in a timely manner. The Shagoutou Management Area of the Honghe Commune, the most severely drought-stricken area in the county, has recently harvested and threshed 864 mu of early rice. After harvesting and testing, the average yield per mu reached 840 jin.

Due to the drought and high temperatures, which are conducive to the breeding of insect pests, various localities have also launched insect extermination campaigns while combating drought. In some areas of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, activities to check for insect pests, drought conditions, and seedling conditions were carried out universally as soon as the seedlings were transplanted. The Liaoyuan Commune in Pu'er County, after conducting three checks on each plot and each paddy in the results, found that armyworms had occurred in four or five management areas. The commune immediately adopted the method of weeding, topdressing, and exterminating insects simultaneously, using 666 powder and native pesticides to kill and prevent insects, achieving a combination of insect extermination and drought resistance, and quickly eliminating the insect pests.

Due to the tight grasp of drought-resistant irrigation, weeding, fertilization, seedling replenishment, and pest control, step by step without letting up, a bumper early rice harvest was finally won.

    陕西战胜严重干旱获得夏粮丰收  贵州抓紧雨后时机灌田抢插水稻
    云南抗住大旱　早稻丰收在望　南部地区开镰收割
    据新华社讯　陕西省夏收已进入大忙时期。关中和汉水平川以及秦岭、巴山山区，到处都是一片繁忙的抢收景象。截至5月31日，全省已收割小麦、夏杂粮和油菜五百八十二万四千多亩。目前全省各地都密切地注意着小麦的黄熟程度和气候变化，随黄随收，进度很快。秦岭山区山阳县漫川公社已收打过秤的六百一十九亩山坡小麦，平均亩产比去年增产六成多。陕南安康县五里公社朱家湾生产队三十一亩半山坡大麦，平均亩产比去年高一倍。
    陕西今年的夏季丰收是战胜种种自然灾害获得的。全省夏收作物从去年播种后一直受旱，小麦条锈病和麦蜘蛛、麦蚜、吸浆虫等病虫害也是近几年中较重的一年。但是全省人民在党的领导下，向干旱宣战，提出无雨保丰收的豪迈口号，展开了顽强的抗旱斗争，一次又一次地克服了病虫害的蔓延。由于抗旱大修水利，使许多过去没有水源的旱地和沙滩麦田也取出了地下水，获得了灌溉，从而获得了丰收。
    往年陕西夏收一般是由南而北、由东到西依次收割。关中西部小麦要比中部迟熟约十天半月，各地回茬麦也比正茬麦成熟迟。可是今年由于管理好，小麦生长整齐，关中西部的乾县等地的收割期，大致和中部相同；迟熟的回茬小麦今年也都与正茬小麦同期成熟。在这种情况下，为了避免造成过熟落粒的损失，各地都及时的部署了收割力量，争取适时收、收快、收细和收好，确保丰产丰收。为此各地动员了大量非农业劳力支援夏收。单是兴平等四县支援抢收的就达三十五万多人。省级机关、部队、学校就抽出一万八千名干部，还组织了两个机械收割大队，分赴麦田多、劳力少的地区帮助抢收。蒲城县抽调了八百多名干部，分别到生产小队担任副队长，把指挥部设在田间，麦子一熟，立即组织收割、搬运、堆积三结合的大兵团突击。汉中市十二名书记、县长有十一名深入社队领导夏收。第一书记张树诚在中所公社五一生产队发现小麦一下变黄，就立即组织九百名社员进行抢收，一天一夜把已熟的一千二百亩小麦全部收回。为了抢晴天，躲雨天，各地还加强了群众性的气象观测预报工作，以便及时抢收。
    据新华社讯　久旱不雨的贵州山区，最近普降喜雨。全省各族社员正以“用好金银水，粮食堆满仓”的喜悦心情，一面大力拦蓄雨水，一面灌田整田，移栽水稻。
    为了保证满栽满插，夺取今年粮食大丰收，全省农村把抢水整田插秧作为当前压倒一切的中心任务。很多地区出现了“上午一片黄，中午水汪汪，下午一片秧”的动人局面。毕节专区普降大雨之后，26日全区出动了六十三万多人、二十一万头耕牛抢水，一天内灌田整田十一万多亩，插秧八万多亩。
    为了解决劳力不足的问题，各人民公社开展大协作，集中统一使用劳力，并大量推广使用插秧机。织金县各生产队在根据等价交换的原则，开展劳力、耕畜、农具、秧苗、肥料等五大协作的同时，组织了九万五千人，三千多头耕牛的支援大军，哪里需要协助就奔赴哪里去支援，全县灌田整田插秧进度大大加快。
    贵州抢水整田插秧进度快，质量高，特别是抓住了深耕、施足底肥、合理密植等几个重要环节。一般田深耕都在八寸以上，做到三犁三耙。
    普降喜雨后，各地坚决贯彻执行了省委“机插为主、手插为辅”的指示，全省有二十多万部插秧机上阵突击，大大加速了插秧进度。
    据新华社讯　云南早稻的田间管理工作做得“早、好、细、全”，在战胜了连续六个多月的大旱以及虫害和霜冻等自然灾害后，目前，全省早稻丰收在望，南部地区已开镰收割。
    今春云南各地气候不够正常，在早稻田间管理过程中，各地社员同自然灾害展开了顽强的斗争。早稻插秧最早的玉溪专区元江县从去年12月栽完后，直到今年5月上旬，滴雨不下，平均气温在摄氏三十八度至四十度，蒸发量大，正当早稻打苞抽穗期间，全县有五千多亩田晒得龟裂。这个县的社员以“要红河上山”的英雄气概，组成了一万五千多人的抗旱大军，十天内沿红河安装了二十一部抽水机、一百台马拉水车和上万部提水工具，并在干涸的稻田边打井五百多口，开挖了十公里长的三条水沟引水灌田，从而保证了全部受旱早稻及时得到灌溉。这个县干旱最严重的红河公社沙沟头管理区已经收割的八百六十四亩早稻，最近经过收打核实验收，平均每亩产量达到了八百四十斤。
    由于天旱气温高，有利虫害滋生，各地在抗旱同时，还开展了灭虫运动。西双版纳傣族自治州的部分地区，刚栽完秧就普遍开展了查虫害、查旱情、查苗情的活动。普洱县燎原公社逐块逐丘三查的结果，发现四、五个管理区发生粘虫，这个社就立即采取了边薅边追边灭虫的办法，使用六六六粉和土农药杀虫、防虫，做到灭虫抗旱两结合，迅速的消灭了虫害。
    由于抗旱灌水、锄草、施肥、补苗、治虫环环抓紧，一步不让，终于夺得了早稻的丰收。
