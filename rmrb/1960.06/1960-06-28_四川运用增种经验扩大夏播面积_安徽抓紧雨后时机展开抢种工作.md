    Sichuan Expands Summer Planting Area Using Experience in Additional Planting
    Anhui Seizes the Opportunity After Rain to Launch Crash Planting
    (Our newspaper Chengdu, 27th dispatch) Sichuan Province is carrying out a mass additional planting movement of "seizing every opportunity and making full use of every inch of land" while planting major spring crops, striving to plant more and harvest more. Various localities are making full use of the successful experience of additional planting of minor spring crops, and are planting grain, oil, melons, beans, vegetables and other crops on field ridges, embankments, beside houses, roadsides, rock edges, river banks and all other scattered gaps. In Wusheng County, where the movement is best carried out, the average amount of seeds needed for additional planting per person is eight catties, and the average number of pumpkin seedlings planted per household is more than 250. Many places have put forward the fighting goal of planting all the field ridges and completing all the empty land, realizing "mountains full of green".
    The province vigorously carried out additional planting last year, which played a great role in overcoming drought. This year's summer harvest shows that the output of additional planting in various places accounts for a certain proportion of the total output, with some counties accounting for about 21%. According to the original additional planting habits of farmers, after continuous summary and improvement, the province's additional planting work has gradually become regularized and institutionalized, and the laws of doing a good job in additional planting have been explored. At the beginning of this year, the additional planting work was more planned and more scientific. Various localities have relatively complete experience in making full use of land and planting various crops according to local conditions. Nanchong Prefecture has created a set of methods of planting sorghum, corn, and loofah on field edges, land edges, and roadsides, planting soybeans and mung beans on field ridges, and planting pumpkins on the roofs of every household according to the characteristics of the crops; Mabian County has increased the planting of ten kinds of melons, ten kinds of beans, ten kinds of vegetables, and four kinds of grains on the "ten sides" such as roadsides and ditch sides. These all ensure that the land is fully utilized, and the crops are planted more and grow well.
    Many places have established spring planting command organizations at all levels. From the county party committee to the commune management district party branch, a secretary is in charge and provides specific leadership. Su Lin, the first secretary of the Wusheng County Party Committee, led more than 100 office cadres to cultivate a pumpkin additional planting command mountain and three additional planting command roads, and organized the secretaries of the district committees and commune party committees to study on the spot, thereby driving the vigorous development of the county's spring additional planting movement. In just two days, the county increased the planting of more than 30 million pumpkin seedlings.
    The practice in various parts of Sichuan Province proves that in order to plant more and better, it is necessary to prepare early and make overall arrangements, especially to solve the contradiction between additional planting and regular planting competing for seeds, fertilizers and labor. Various localities have taken the method of organizing mutual adjustment between regions, communes, and management districts as the main method, supplemented by the supply from national granaries, and prepared sufficient seeds as early as possible. In order to solve the contradiction between additional planting and regular planting competing for labor, various localities have generally established additional planting professional teams, assigned plots and contracted them, and are solely responsible for them; and organized the masses to cooperate with concentrated efforts during busy intervals, so that both regular planting and additional planting are not delayed, and the management of additional planting crops is guaranteed.

    (Our newspaper Hefei, 27th dispatch) Various parts of Anhui Province are seizing the favorable opportunity after the end of the summer harvest and the rain to vigorously launch a crash summer planting. Seven million people across the province are participating in the crash planting and transplanting every day. As of June 16, more than 21 million mu of summer crops such as mid-season rice, sweet potatoes, soybeans, and tobacco have been planted, and the daily sowing progress has accelerated by more than two times compared with before.
    Since June 6, Anhui Province has experienced continuous rainfall. The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed all localities to concentrate their efforts to fully launch the crash planting work to ensure a complete victory in the summer planting. Party committees at all levels, according to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, quickly took measures to speed up the sowing progress. Many first secretaries of the prefectural and county party committees have gone deep into the grassroots level and organized a large number of strong cadres to go deep into the front line of production to strengthen specific leadership. Sixteen communes in Funan County dispatched 850 cadres to the production teams, assigned plots and contracted them, and organized more than 340,000 people to crash plant various crops. Bengbu Prefecture has mobilized more than 2.8 million people every day in recent days to crash transplant summer crops such as rice, sweet potatoes, and tobacco.
    This year, Anhui Province has greatly expanded the area of summer planting to half of the total cultivated land area through vigorous land reclamation and full utilization of vacant land. During the summer planting, various localities tried every means to expand the sowing area and improve the sowing quality. Xuancheng County, through accounting and queuing the tasks, land and crops of the summer planting, took measures to vigorously utilize wasteland and intercropping, mixed planting, and relay intercropping, and planted all barren mountains and wastelands with sweet potatoes; intercropped sesame in sweet potato, cotton, and young forest land; planted corn on the edges of pumpkin ridges, and planted soybeans on field ridges. The county's summer planting area can reach 500,000 mu, an expansion of about 35% compared with last year.

    四川运用增种经验扩大夏播面积
    安徽抓紧雨后时机展开抢种工作
    本报成都27日电　四川省各地在种好大春正种作物的同时，开展了“见缝插针，寸土不闲”的全民增种运动，力争多种多收。各地充分运用小春作物增种的成功经验，利用田坎、地埂、屋侧、路旁、岩畔、河边以及其他一切零星隙地，大种粮食、油料、瓜、豆、蔬菜等作物。运动开展得最好的武胜县，平均每人增种需用的种子就有八斤，平均每户种南瓜二百五十窝以上。许多地方提出了把田坎种尽，把空地种完，实现“满山青”的奋斗目标。
    全省去年大搞增种，对战胜干旱起了很大作用；今年夏收中，各地增种粮食产量在总产量中都占有一定比重，有的县占21％左右。根据农民原有的增种习惯，经过不断总结、提高，全省增种工作已逐步正规化和制度化，摸索出搞好增种的规律。今年一开始，增种工作就更有计划、更科学。各地在利用土地，因地制宜增种各项作物方面，都有了比较成套的经验。南充专区按照作物的特点，创造了田边、地边、路边种高粱、玉米、丝瓜，田背坎种黄豆、绿豆，家家户户屋顶种南瓜的一套办法；马边县在路旁、沟旁等“十旁”增种十瓜、十豆、十菜、四粮。这些都保证了土地利用得充分，作物种得多、长得好。
    许多地方都层层建立了大春增种指挥机构，从县委到公社管理区党支部都有书记一人挂帅，具体领导。武胜县委第一书记苏林率领一百多个机关干部，培植了一座南瓜增种指挥山和三条增种指挥路，并组织各区委和公社党委书记，到现场学习，从而带动了全县大春增种运动的蓬勃开展。仅两天时间，全县即增种南瓜三千多万窝。
    四川省各地的实践证明，要多种、种好，必须及早准备，全面安排，特别是要解决增种与正种争种子、争肥料、争劳动力的矛盾。各地采取组织地区与地区、公社与公社、管理区与管理区之间相互调剂为主，国家粮库供应为辅的办法，及早备足了种子。为了解决增种与正种争劳动力的矛盾，各地一般都建立了增种专业队，划片包干，专门负责；并组织群众利用大忙间隙配合突击，做到了正种增种两不误，并且保证了增种作物的管理。
    本报合肥27日电　安徽省各地正抓住夏收结束和雨后的有利时机，大力突击夏种。全省每天参加抢栽抢种的有七百万人，到6月16日，已栽种中稻、山芋、大豆、烟叶等夏种作物达二千一百多万亩，播种日进度比以前加快两倍多。
    自6月6日以后，安徽省连续降雨。中共安徽省委指示各地集中力量，全面开展抢种工作，保证夺取夏种的全胜。各级党委根据省委指示，迅速采取措施，加快播种进度。很多地委、县委第一书记，都深入下去，并组织大批强有力的干部，深入生产第一线，加强具体领导。阜南县十六个公社，抽调了八百五十多名干部深入社队，划片包干，组织三十四万多人抢种各种作物。蚌埠专区连日来每天出动二百八十多万人，抢栽水稻、山芋、烟叶等夏种作物。
    安徽省今年经过大力开荒和充分利用空隙地，使夏种面积达到总耕地面积的一半。在夏种中，各地千方百计地扩大播种面积，提高播种质量。宣城县通过夏种任务、土地、作物的算账排队，采取大力利用荒地和间种、混种、套种等办法，将荒山荒地全部种山芋；在山芋、棉花、幼林地里套种芝麻；南瓜垱边种玉米，田埂地边种大豆。全县夏种面积可达到五十万亩，比去年扩大35％左右。
