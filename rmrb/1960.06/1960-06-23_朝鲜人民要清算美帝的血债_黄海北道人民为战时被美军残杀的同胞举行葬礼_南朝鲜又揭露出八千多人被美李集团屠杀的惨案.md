Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 21st - Newspapers here reported today: On the 20th, the people of Pingsan Township, Pingsan County, North Hwanghae Province, North Korea, held a funeral for more than two thousand six hundred compatriots who were brutally murdered by the U.S. imperialist invading army during the war. The remains of these victims were discovered in various parts of Pingsan County in early June this year.

More than 10,000 people, including family members and relatives of the deceased, as well as party and government leaders of North Hwanghae Province and representatives from various parts of the province, attended the funeral.

At the funeral ceremony, Li Jae-young, Chairman of the North Hwanghae Provincial Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, delivered a memorial speech. Zhang Shangyuan, a worker from the Hwanghae Iron and Steel Works, said in his speech: Recalling the scene when his entire family of ten were tied with wire by the enemy and thrown into the river to drown, he felt boundless anger! He said: In order to prevent such tragedies from happening again, we must drive the U.S. imperialists out of South Korea and peacefully reunify the motherland.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 20th - According to a South Korean dispatch cited by the Korean Central News Agency, two days before Eisenhower’s "visit" to South Korea, more cases of South Korean people being massacred by the U.S.-Rhee clique were exposed. According to reports, a total of 8,800 people were massacred and more than 13,000 houses were burned down in North Gyeongsang Province, South Gyeongsang Province, North Jeolla Province, South Jeolla Province, and Jeju Island.

This figure was announced by the puppet "National Assembly's" "Massacre Investigation Team" on June 18 under the pressure of South Korean public opinion demanding the punishment of the executioners.

Prior to this, it had already been revealed that 70,000 people had been massacred on Jeju Island and tens of thousands in Busan.

Since 1951, more than one million innocent South Korean people have been killed by the U.S.-Rhee clique.

In condemning these atrocities, the Korean Central News Agency pointed out that today, the chief murderer Eisenhower has once again entered South Korea, clamoring about "freedom," "friendship," and "peace." However, the people who have lost their children, husbands, and parents fully understand the true meaning of his so-called "freedom" and "friendship."

The Korean Central News Agency said that the Korean people will one day try this chief murderer and settle the general account with him.

    朝鲜人民要清算美帝的血债
    黄海北道人民为战时被美军残杀的同胞举行葬礼
    南朝鲜又揭露出八千多人被美李集团屠杀的惨案
    新华社平壤21日电　这里报纸今天报道：朝鲜北部黄海北道平山郡平山邑20日为战争时期被美帝国主义侵略军残杀的二千六百多名死难同胞举行葬礼。这些死难者的遗骸是今年6月初在平山郡各地发现的。
    参加葬礼的有死者的家属、亲友以及黄海北道的党政领导人和道内各地代表等一万多人。
    在葬礼仪式上，朝鲜劳动党黄海北道委员会委员长李在英致了追悼词。黄海制铁所的工人张尚源讲话时说：回想起当年全家十口人被敌人用铁丝捆起来投入河中淹死的情景，心中无比的愤怒！他说：为了不让这种惨剧重演，必须把美帝国主义从南朝鲜赶出去，和平统一祖国。
    据新华社平壤20日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社援引南朝鲜消息报道，在艾森豪威尔“访问”南朝鲜以前两天，又有南朝鲜大批人民被美李集团屠杀的案件被揭露出来。据揭露，在庆尚北道、庆尚南道、全罗北道、全罗南道和济州岛，共有八千八百人被屠杀，一万三千多间房子被烧毁。
    这个数字是伪“国会”的“屠杀情况调查小组”6月18日在南朝鲜人民要求惩办刽子手的舆论压力下宣布的。
    在这以前，已经揭露了济州岛有七万人，釜山有好几万人被屠杀的情况。
    自从1951年以来，有一百多万名无辜的南朝鲜人民被美李集团杀害。
    朝鲜中央通讯社在谴责这些惨案时指出，今天，杀人头子艾森豪威尔再次进入南朝鲜，叫嚷“自由”、“友谊”和“和平”。但是，失去子女、丈夫和父母的人民是完全懂得他所谓的“自由”和“友谊”的真正含义的。
    朝鲜中央通讯社说，朝鲜人民总有一天会审判这个杀人头子，会同他算清总账的。
