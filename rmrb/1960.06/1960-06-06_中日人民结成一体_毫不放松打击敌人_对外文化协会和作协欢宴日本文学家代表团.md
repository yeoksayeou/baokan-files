Xinhua News Agency, June 5th: The Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the Chinese Writers Association held a banquet this noon to warmly welcome the Japanese Writers Delegation headed by Hiroshi Noma.

Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and Mao Dun, Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, attended the banquet and gave toasts and speeches.

Mao Dun, Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, spoke at the beginning of the banquet. The full text is as follows: Friends, today, the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the Chinese Writers Association are holding a banquet here to warmly welcome our colleagues—the Japanese Writers Delegation headed by Mr. Hiroshi Noma—to visit China. We are pleased to see that progressive Japanese literary and art circles are standing at the forefront of the Japanese people, carrying out heroic struggles against U.S. imperialism and its running dog, the Nobusuke Kishi's traitorous government. You have made tremendous contributions in this surging and magnificent struggle. The Chinese people, writers and artists express their deep admiration and firm support for the patriotic and just struggle being waged by the Japanese people, writers and artists. We express our heartfelt gratitude to you for coming to our country to visit, conduct cultural exchanges, and enhance the friendship between the two peoples at this important juncture of the struggle.

Currently, the Japanese people are launching the 17th unified action, waging a powerful struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dog, the Nobusuke Kishi's traitorous government, demanding Kishi's resignation, the dissolution of the Diet, the abolition of the "U.S.-Japan Military Treaty," and opposing U.S. President Eisenhower's visit to Japan. Yesterday's successful general strike by 5.6 million Japanese workers was a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism and its running dog, Kishi Nobusuke, and further demonstrated the powerful strength of the Japanese people. We firmly believe that this unified action will inevitably continue to achieve greater victories.

U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese people, and the common enemy of all peace-loving people in the world. The Chinese people and artists have always regarded supporting the Japanese people's struggle as their sacred duty, and the Japanese people's struggle as their own struggle. We firmly believe that with the support of the people of the world, the Japanese people will surely be able to smash the aggressive U.S.-Japan military alliance and completely drive the forces of U.S. imperialism out of Japan. Victory belongs to the Japanese people!

I propose a toast: to the friendly unity of the Chinese and Japanese people, to the further development of literary and artistic exchanges between China and Japan, to the victory of Japan's cause of independence, peace, democracy, and neutrality, and to the good health of Mr. Hiroshi Noma, head of the Japanese Writers Delegation, and all the other gentlemen!

Hiroshi Noma spoke amidst warm applause. The full text is as follows: Dear friends, dear sirs:

Thanks to the friendly invitation of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the Chinese Writers Association, we—the Japanese Writers Delegation to China—have arrived in Beijing, our long-awaited destination. We express our heartfelt gratitude. We could not be happier. We were welcomed at Shenzhen by Mr. Li Yingru of the Chinese Writers Association, who had come specially from Beijing, and then welcomed in Guangzhou by Mr. Sun Pinghua, Deputy Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries. Yesterday, at the Beijing Railway Station, we were welcomed by Mr. Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, Mr. Mao Dun, Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, Mr. Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and more than 200 other prominent figures from Beijing's cultural circles. Today, we are honored to attend this grand welcome banquet at this Sichuan restaurant. We express our heartfelt gratitude.

We are now in China, which we had been picturing in our minds until just a few days ago. Our dear Chinese friends are by our side. China, which is carrying out the great socialist construction we are pursuing, is now within our reach. We are breathing the air of China, no, we are breathing China. Moreover, we are receiving a sincere and precious hospitality that far exceeds what we had imagined. At the station, at customs, on the train, and in the hotel, we have come into contact with the deep feelings of the Chinese people, which we cannot estimate. This first impression of coming to China is deeply engraved in our hearts and will probably be unforgettable for a lifetime. We are here to express our gratitude by frankly stating what our first impression is.

Regarding the purpose of our—the Japanese Writers Delegation to China—visit to China, as mentioned in the speech delivered by the Japanese Writers Delegation at the Beijing Railway Station yesterday. We learned in detail through the news published in the People's Daily that our 5.6 million comrades in Japan achieved great success yesterday—June 4th—in the struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance, centered on the general strike of the working class. We feel very excited and happy. We were able to participate in this advancing struggle on the first day of our arrival in Beijing, which was entirely possible after receiving the great strength of the Chinese people's support for the struggle against the new security treaty. Although we knew in Japan that the Chinese people were giving very great support to the Japanese people's struggle against the security treaty, after arriving in China, we realized that this support was far beyond our imagination and on a huge scale. Moreover, we know that this support is not merely limited to supporting the Japanese people with all their strength, but has become a struggle integrated with the Japanese people, a struggle itself. From the first day of our arrival, we were able to use our weapon—our voice—to fly across the ocean through the radio and directly appeal to and encourage Japanese workers, students, cultural circles, commercial and industrial associations, and housewives; we were also able to use our weapon—our pen—to participate in the 17th unified action and carry out this struggle. All of this is due to the tremendous strength of the Chinese people's struggle, which is integrated with the Japanese people, against the common enemies of the Japanese people—U.S. imperialism and Japanese militarism. In Beijing, we are working as Japanese literary workers to carry out this powerful struggle that unites Japan and China. We once again thank the Chinese comrades and comrades in Beijing's cultural circles for giving us this opportunity. The Japanese people clearly recognize that all the undemocratic and unconstitutional atrocities committed by the Kishi government before dawn on May 20 are directly related to U.S. imperialism, which flew the U-2 aircraft and sabotaged the Paris summit conference. It is very clear that the Kishi government's attempt to forcibly pass the new security treaty in the Senate is closely related to President Eisenhower's visit to Japan and the SEATO Foreign Ministers' Conference. However, we are convinced that the more obvious these conditions become, the more the struggle of the Japanese and Chinese people united will advance, relentlessly and increasingly fiercely pursuing the enemy.

We would like to reiterate in this speech that the Japanese people's determination and strength to fight stems from the Japanese people's recognition that peace, democracy, and independence are the most precious things. We would also like to state that this determination and strength comes from the constant reflection that the large-scale wars Japan waged in the past caused great suffering to the people of Asian countries, especially the Chinese people. In the struggle against the new security treaty, which is developing on the largest scale and most broadly in the Japanese people's struggle, the Japanese people are demanding the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, believing that this is precisely what Japan should prioritize above all else. We are waging the struggle against the new security treaty from the desire to oppose military alliances aimed at war and aggression and to restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China and North Korea. We see great significance in this. Syngman Rhee, the U.S. imperialism's ally in South Korea, and Adnan Menderes, the U.S. imperialism's ally in Turkey, have both been ousted in the struggles of the South Korean and Turkish people. It goes without saying that the next one is Nobusuke Kishi.

Our Japanese Writers Delegation will learn many things from Chinese writers in Beijing while conducting the struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance. We will draw strength from China to create and develop Japanese literature, following the many previous visits to China by Japanese writers' delegations.

Finally, we would like to deeply express our gratitude for the generous assistance given to the Japanese Writers Delegation by the Chinese Writers Delegation at the Tashkent Conference to conclude my speech.

Liao Chengzhi said in his toast that we sincerely thank our Japanese friends for giving great support to the cause of the Chinese people. We congratulate the Japanese people on their continuous victories in the struggle against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and the Nobusuke Kishi's traitorous government. We hope that our friends in the Japanese literary and art circles will advance victoriously in the struggle and continue to achieve greater victories.

The speeches and toasts of the hosts and guests received wave after wave of warm applause.

The banquet was filled with an atmosphere of friendly unity. Chinese writers and Japanese writers gathered together and talked cordially. Chu Tunan, Katsuiro Kamei, Yoko Matsuoka, Minoru Takeuchi, Ken Kaiko, Kenzaburo Oe and other famous figures from Chinese and Japanese cultural circles frequently raised their glasses to toast the victory of Japan's cause of independence, peace, democracy and neutrality, to the victory of the patriotic struggle against U.S. imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary clique, to the friendly unity of the Chinese and Japanese people, and to the further development of literary and artistic exchanges between China and Japan.

More than 60 famous figures from Chinese literary and art circles attended the banquet, including Yang Hansheng, Lao She, Shao Quanlin, Ouyang Yuqian, Lü Ji, Wu Zuoren, Liu Kaiqu, Cai Chusheng, and Xie Bingxin.

Japanese peace activist Kinkazu Saionji and his wife, and Korean peace activist Hwang Bong-gu were also invited to attend the banquet.

    中日人民结成一体  毫不放松打击敌人
    对外文化协会和作协欢宴日本文学家代表团
    据新华社5日讯　中国人民对外文化协会、中国作家协会，今天中午举行宴会，热烈欢迎以野间宏为首的日本文学家代表团。
    中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志、中国人民对外文化协会会长楚图南、中国作家协会主席茅盾出席了宴会。并且在宴会上祝酒、讲话。
    中国作家协会主席茅盾在宴会开始时讲话。全文如下：朋友们：今天，中国人民对外文化协会、中国作家协会在这里举行宴会，热烈欢迎我们的同行——以野间宏先生为首的日本文学家代表团前来中国访问。我们高兴地看到，日本进步文艺界人士站在日本人民的前列，同美帝国主义及其走狗岸信介卖国政府进行了英勇的斗争。你们在这风起云涌波澜壮阔的斗争中，做出了巨大的贡献。中国人民和文学家艺术家，对日本人民和文学家艺术家正在进行的爱国正义斗争表示十分钦佩和坚决支持。你们在斗争的重要关头，前来我国访问，进行文化交流，增进两国人民之间的友谊，我们表示衷心的感谢。
    目前，日本人民正在掀起第十七次统一行动，向美帝国主义及其走狗岸信介卖国政府展开强大的斗争，要求岸信介辞职、解散国会，废除“日美军事条约”，反对美国总统艾森豪威尔访问日本。昨天日本工人五百六十万人胜利的总罢工，是给美帝国主义及其走狗岸信介一个沉重的打击，更表现出日本人民强大的力量。我们坚信，这次统一行动，必然会继续取得更大的胜利。
    美帝国主义是中日两国人民共同的敌人，是全世界爱好和平人民的共同敌人。中国人民和文艺家始终把支持日本人民的斗争当做自己的神圣义务，把日本人民的斗争当做自己的斗争。我们坚信日本人民在全世界人民的支持下，一定能够粉碎侵略性的日美军事同盟，一定能够把美帝国主义势力从日本彻底驱逐出去。胜利属于日本人民！
    我建议：为中日两国人民的友好团结，为中日两国文学艺术交流的进一步发展，为日本独立、和平、民主、中立事业的胜利，为以野间宏先生为首的日本文学家代表团各位先生的身体健康，干杯！
    野间宏在热烈的掌声中讲话。全文如下：各位朋友、各位先生：
    由于中国人民对外文化协会、中国作家协会的充满友情的邀请，我们——日本访华文学家代表团来到了我们一直憧憬着的目的地北京。我们衷心地表示感谢。我们再没有比这更高兴的了。我们在深圳受到特地从北京赶来的中国作家协会李英儒先生的欢迎，接着在广州受到中国人民对外文化协会副秘书长孙平化先生的欢迎，昨天，在北京车站，受到中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志先生、中国作家协会主席茅盾先生、中国人民对外文化协会会长楚图南先生等北京文化界著名人士二百余人的欢迎，今天，又承在这家四川饭店举行盛大的欢迎会，我们衷心地表示感谢。
    我们现在是在我们直到几天以前的时候止还一直在心目中描绘着的中国。中国的亲爱的朋友们就在我们的身旁。正在进行着我们所追求的伟大的社会主义建设的中国，现在就在我们挥手可及的地方，我们正在呼吸着中国的空气，不，正在呼吸着中国。而且，我们正受到远远超过我们曾经想像过的真诚的、最可贵的款待。在车站、在海关、在列车中、在饭店，我们接触到了深厚的我们所不能估量的中国人民的情谊。这个来到中国的第一个印象已经深深地铭刻心中，恐怕是一生难忘的。我们在这里表明我们首先得到什么样的印象，从而坦率地表明我们的谢意。
    关于我们——日本访华文学家代表团这次访问中国的目的，就像日本文学家代表团昨天在北京车站发表的讲话中谈到的那样。我们通过人民日报登载的消息，详尽地获知，我们在日本的五百六十万同志们在昨天——6月4日，为了反对日美军事同盟，以工人阶级的总罢工为中心而进行的斗争取得了很大的成功。我们感到非常兴奋和高兴。我们能够在到达的第一天在北京参加了这场正在前进着的斗争，这完全是在得到中国的反对新安全条约的斗争的巨大力量的支持之后才有可能的。我们在日本虽然知道中国人民给予日本人民的反对安全条约斗争以非常大的支援，可是，到了中国以后，我们才知道这个支援是远远超出了我们所想像的范围的、有着巨大规模的。而且，我们知道这个支援不是仅仅停留在用全力支援日本人民的地步，而是变成了同日本人民结为一体的斗争，变成了斗争本身。从我们到达的第一天起，能够通过广播用我们的武器——声音，飞越海洋，直接向日本的工人、学生、文化界、商工会、主妇们发出呼吁、进行鼓舞；还能够用我们的武器——笔参加第十七次统一行动，进行这个斗争，都是由于中国的同日本人民结成一体的、对日本人民的共同敌人——美国帝国主义和日本军国主义的斗争的巨大力量。我们在北京作为日本文学工作者正进行着这场日本和中国结成一体的、有着巨大威力的斗争。我们再一次感谢给我们以这个可能的中国同志们、北京文化界的同志们。日本人民清楚地认识到岸政府在5月20日黎明以前进行的不民主的、破坏宪法的全部暴行是直接同驾驶U—2型飞机、破坏了巴黎的首脑会议的美国帝国主义有关系的。非常明显，岸政府企图在参议院强行通过新安全条约的行动同艾森豪威尔总统访问日本、东南亚条约组织外交部长会议有密切的关系。但是，我们确信，这样的条件越是明显，日本人民和中国人民结成一体的斗争就越会前进，毫不松弛地、愈来愈猛烈地追击敌人。
    我们想在这个讲话中再次说明，日本人民进行斗争的决心和力量是产生于日本人民的这样一种认识，日本人民透彻地知道和平、民主和独立是最最宝贵的东西。我们还想说明，这种决心和力量产生于这样的不断的反省：由于日本过去进行的大规模战争，曾经使亚洲各国的广大人民，尤其是中国人民遭受到很大的痛苦。在日本人民的斗争中最大规模地、最广泛地发展着的反对新安全条约的斗争中，日本人民要求恢复日中邦交，认为这正是日本应当比其他一切事情都要优先地做到的事情。我们从反对目的在于战争和侵略的军事同盟、要求恢复日本同中国、同朝鲜的邦交的愿望出发，进行着反对新安全条约的斗争。我们从这里看到了巨大的意义。美帝国主义在南朝鲜的同盟者李承晚、在土耳其的同盟者曼德列斯，都在南朝鲜和土耳其人民的斗争中被驱逐出去了。不言而喻，下一个就是岸信介了。
    我们日本文学家代表团，在北京将一面进行反对日美军事同盟的斗争，一面向中国的文学家们学习许多东西。我们要继迄今多次访问过中国的日本文学家代表团之后，从中国汲取创造并发展日本文学的力量。
    最后，我们对于日本文学家代表团在塔什干会议时受到中国文学家代表团的许多盛情帮助，深深表示感谢，来结束我的讲话。
    廖承志在祝酒中说，我们衷心地感谢日本朋友对中国人民的事业予以很大的支持。我们祝贺日本人民反对日美“安全条约”和岸信介卖国政府的斗争不断取得更大的胜利，我们希望日本文学艺术家的朋友们在斗争中乘胜前进，继续不断取得更大的胜利。
    宾主的讲话和祝酒获得了一阵又一阵热烈的掌声。
    宴会上，充满了友好团结的气氛，中国文学家和日本文学家，欢聚在一起，亲切地交谈。楚图南、龟井胜一郎、松冈洋子、竹内实、开高健、大江健三郎等中日文化界著名人士相互频频举杯，为日本独立、和平、民主中立事业的胜利，为反对美帝国主义和岸信介反动集团爱国斗争的胜利，为中日两国人民的友好团结，为中日两国文学艺术的交流进一步发展干杯。
    出席宴会作陪的有阳翰笙、老舍、邵荃麟、欧阳予倩、吕骥、吴作人、刘开渠、蔡楚生、谢冰心等中国文学艺术界著名人士六十多人。
    日本和平人士西园寺公一和夫人、朝鲜和平人士黄凤九也应邀出席了宴会。（附图片）
