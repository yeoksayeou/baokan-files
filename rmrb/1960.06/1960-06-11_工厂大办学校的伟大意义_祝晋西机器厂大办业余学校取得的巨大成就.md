The urgent question posed to us by the high-speed development of socialist construction in our country is: Can all our factories, mines, and enterprises run amateur schools and part-work, part-study schools on a large scale? And can these amateur schools and part-work, part-study schools cultivate intellectuals from the working class at high speed and with high quality?

Factories running schools is not news to us. Since liberation, many factories, mines, and enterprises have run full-time primary schools for the children of employees, employee literacy classes, employee primary schools, as well as full-time or part-work, part-study technical schools and secondary technical schools, and so on. However, the concept of factories running schools has evolved from a relatively narrow old concept with great limitations to a new concept where a factory is both a factory and a school, and the factory must cultivate new communist people while producing material goods. This is a product of the Great Leap Forward of 1958. Since then, two years of practice have proven that all factories, mines, and enterprises can not only run amateur primary schools, amateur secondary schools, and part-work, part-study secondary schools on a large scale, but also run amateur and part-work, part-study institutions of higher learning (large factories can run several schools, and small factories can jointly run one school). Some large-scale factories, mines, and enterprises can also gradually establish a full-time educational system from primary school to university. At the same time, the successful experiences of the Jinxi Machine Factory in Taiyuan and many other advanced factories, mines, and enterprises have also proven that the amateur and part-work, part-study schools run by factories, mines, and enterprises, from lower to higher levels, are fully capable of cultivating intellectuals from the working class at high speed and with high quality. It is evident that factory-run schools have entered a new stage of development. That is to say, it has become an important component of the great cultural revolution movement currently underway in our country. Clearly, all factories, mines, and enterprises running various forms of schools on a large scale from lower to higher levels, especially running employee amateur schools on a large scale, is an inevitable trend adapting to the high-speed development of socialist construction in our country.

Do all leading cadres of factories, mines, and enterprises have a correct understanding of this inevitable trend of factories running schools on a large scale? No. As long as we conduct a serious comparison and analysis, we can see that the actual situation is as follows: Most leading cadres show great enthusiasm and correct methods for factories running schools, and therefore the effect is great; a small number of leading cadres show inconsistency and conservative methods, and therefore the effect is not great; and a very small number of leading cadres have not even put this issue on the agenda. Obviously, these latter two types of people cannot be said to have a correct understanding of such a major event as factories running schools on a large scale. They are still in a state of skepticism or semi-skepticism. In their view, factories running schools can only be done on a small scale and not on a large scale. What are the reasons? It is nothing more than that factories running schools on a large scale will delay production, and factories running schools on a large scale lack teachers and textbooks. Therefore, their conclusion is that factories running schools on a large scale must be slow and of low quality, "not worth the effort," and so on. In short, they see a pile of "insurmountable difficulties" in front of them. In fact, just by looking at the vivid facts of the Jinxi Machine Factory, one can see at a glance that their pessimistic views are nothing more than a complete reflection of the worldview of the lazy and cowardly.

The Jinxi Machine Factory began running amateur schools on a large scale in 1956, and in just three or four years, the cultural and spiritual outlook of all employees in the factory has undergone a dramatic change. Now, this factory has truly become both a factory and a school. Nearly 90% of the employees in the factory are studying in schools of various levels and types. These school formats are: amateur primary schools, secondary schools, and universities; part-work, part-study secondary technical schools and engineering colleges. In addition, there is also a full-time secondary technical school. To date, 306 employees have graduated from amateur junior high school, 137 employees have graduated from amateur senior high school and part-work, part-study secondary technical school, and 54 employees have graduated from amateur and part-work, part-study universities (equal to 74% of the total number of college graduates assigned to the factory by the state in the past ten years). Among all employees in the factory, there are no more illiterates. The proportion of employees with primary school education increased from 32% of the total number of employees before 1956 to 42%, the proportion of employees with junior high school and senior high school education increased from 41% of the total number of employees before 1956 to 50%, and the proportion of employees with university education increased from 2% of the total number of employees before 1956 to 8%. Moreover, about 90% of the employees in the factory have organized 480 Mao Zedong Thought study groups, and have also established a theoretical lecturer group with more than 400 workers participating. It can be seen that they not only attach great importance to the study of culture, science and technology, but also attach great importance to the study of political theory. What is particularly encouraging is that the engineering college established by the factory in 1958 cultivated its first batch of 43 graduates in May of this year. Among these 43 university graduates, apart from 12 who were originally technicians with a considerable level of education, the rest were all production workers. Among them, ten (all veteran workers with more than ten years of service) were illiterate before 1953. These ten people, after about six years of studying in amateur schools, basically reached the cultural level of senior high school graduates, and then after one year and eight months of part-work, part-study in the engineering college and the final three months of studying away from production, that is, using half the time of a full-time university, they reached the level of graduates from full-time universities of the same nature. Their graduation theses and graduation designs are in no way inferior to those of graduates from full-time universities. Moreover, their ability to solve scientific and technological problems in production far exceeds that of ordinary university students. The example of these ten veteran workers is an excellent inspiration for all workers who are still illiterate, semi-illiterate, or whose cultural level is not high enough. People will naturally ask, since they can climb to the peak of scientific and cultural knowledge at such a rapid pace, why can't people who are in the same conditions as them or even have more favorable conditions do the same? At the same time, the example of these ten veteran workers is also an excellent inspiration for all leading cadres of factories, mines, and enterprises. This makes them realize that gradually popularizing higher education in factories, mines, and enterprises is not as mysterious and unattainable as those mediocre people see it. Now, the part-work, part-study university and amateur university run by the Jinxi Machine Factory have ten majors including machinery, metallurgy, electrical engineering, mathematics, physics, Chinese language, medicine, pharmacy, Russian language, and business management, with a total of more than 800 students. And they have already made the following plan: starting from the second half of this year, strive to popularize junior high school in one year, senior high school in three years, and university in seven years. That is, by 1966, the number of existing employees entering university and graduating from university will account for more than 80% of the total number of existing employees. It can be predicted that their plan is entirely possible to achieve, and it is by no means an unfounded fantasy.

All the above facts eloquently refute the fallacies of those skeptics and semi-skeptics that factories running schools on a large scale must be slow and of low quality.

Does factories running schools on a large scale necessarily delay production? The facts of the Jinxi Machine Factory also happen to be the opposite. The result of factories running schools on a large scale is not to delay production, but to greatly promote production. Since November 1957, the factory has had a continuous thirty months of full production every month and every quarter. Obviously, they have merged the torrent of the cultural revolution with the torrent of technological innovation and technological revolution into a mighty torrent. Therefore, the creative inventions of the employees are emerging one after another. Not only is the number of creative inventions increasing, but its quality is also getting higher and higher. Taking the employees who graduated from the engineering college this time as an example. During their studies, they put forward a total of 319 suggestions for technological innovation, of which 232 have now been implemented. The implementation of these innovation suggestions has increased production efficiency by dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of times. On the eve of their graduation, they also made eight graduation designs of great value, and five of them have now been implemented. It can be seen that the popularization and improvement of the scientific and cultural level of the working masses has made them as powerful as tigers with wings in the technological revolution movement, thus continuously generating waves of labor productivity that are higher than the previous ones. Is there any need for any doubt about this?

Are the difficulties of factories running schools lacking textbooks and teachers insurmountable? Speaking of textbooks and teachers, the conditions of the Jinxi Machine Factory are not particularly superior to those of other factories, mines, and enterprises. They did encounter these difficulties in the process of running schools on a large scale. However, they did not bow to difficulties, but adopted a bold revolutionary spirit to overcome these difficulties one by one, step by step. On the issue of reforming the school system, curriculum, textbooks, and teaching methods, they encountered resistance from people with bourgeois educational viewpoints. These people spread various fallacies, saying: "Amateur schools and part-work, part-study schools must be run like the current general full-time schools to be considered formal." "Textbooks are written by experts and authorities, and cannot be changed." "The teaching syllabus is law, and is sacred and inviolable." And so on. In short, they pretended to be "experts" to scare people. They dared not cross the line of the school system, curriculum, textbooks, and teaching methods left over from the bourgeoisie that were divorced from reality and production. The working masses gave a sharp and incisive criticism of their bourgeois viewpoints. The working masses said: "Amateur schools are taking the formal road, adults are reading children's books, the curriculum is too much, the progress is too slow, it is not useful, and it cannot be finished." That's right, the Jinxi Machine Factory relied on the working masses to carry out the struggle between the two lines of more, faster, better, and more economical and less, slower, worse, and more expensive. In all aspects of the school system, curriculum, textbooks, and teaching methods, according to the principle that factory-run schools must combine with production, link with reality, suit the characteristics of adults, learn for application, and the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical, they adopted the spirit of continuous revolution and the working method of the mass line, and boldly carried out various reform attempts. Through such bold attempts, they began to explore a correct road of more, faster, better, and more economical. Of course, this road still needs to be continuously tested and developed in practice in order to gradually improve it. However, the series of teaching reform measures they have adopted have achieved remarkable results, and the iron facts have finally forced those who advocate less, slower, worse, and more expensive to admit defeat. In solving the problem of the lack of teachers, they also adopted revolutionary methods. That is, in addition to transferring a number of qualified full-time teachers from the factory's technical personnel and hiring part-time teachers from inside and outside the factory, they paid special attention to cultivating and selecting teachers from among the workers. Now, more than 160 workers are serving as part-time teachers, accounting for 45% of the total number of part-time teachers. They have been warmly welcomed by the students. The first worker teacher to take the stage, Chang An, a fifth-grade electrician, because he already has a considerable level of education, rich practical knowledge, and is familiar with the psychology and requirements of the workers, when he explained the principles of long-distance power transmission and transformers in the physics class of the secondary technical school, it was both vivid and specific, and was unanimously praised by the students. In the past, when many teachers from intellectual backgrounds explained this principle, the students tried their best, but still failed to grasp the essentials. It can be seen that since teachers can come from the working masses, then the difficulty of the lack of teachers can also be solved easily. Of course, people with bourgeois educational viewpoints will not believe this. However, the facts of the Jinxi Machine Factory are indeed so.

It should be pointed out that the root cause of those who still hold skeptical or semi-skeptical views on the matter of factories running schools on a large scale is that they do not understand the great significance of factories running schools and the need to implement educational revolution. What are the great significances? Based on the above, it is necessary to point out the following:

First, it is the foundation for promoting the technological revolution movement to develop continuously forward at high speed and with high quality, and therefore it is an indispensable condition for ensuring a continuous Great Leap Forward in socialist construction. Socialist factories, mines, and enterprises should not only strive to produce material products, but more importantly, strive to cultivate new communist people. Because the quality of human products directly affects and determines the material products. Therefore, only by making people's communist consciousness and scientific and cultural level universally and continuously improved can we achieve continuous production leaps in the long period of building socialism and transitioning to communism.

Second, factories, mines, and enterprises are the best places to implement the Party Central Committee's educational policy of education serving proletarian politics and education combining with productive labor, and are the best places to implement educational revolution in accordance with this educational policy. As long as all factories, mines, and enterprises, and even all urban and rural people's communes, run schools on a large scale, and continuously and correctly implement teaching reforms, then the scientific and cultural level and the theoretical level of Marxism-Leninism of the broad masses of workers and peasants will be greatly improved. We can also achieve the main task of the cultural revolution pointed out by the Party Central Committee with more, faster, better, and more economical means, that is, "to establish a contingent of tens of millions of working-class intellectuals, including a contingent of technical cadres (which is the largest in number), professors, teachers, scientists, journalists, writers, artists, and Marxist theorists."

Third, the Party Central Committee's resolution on the issue of establishing people's communes in rural areas pointed out that the great improvement of the communist ideological awareness and moral qualities of the entire people, the popularization and improvement of universal education, and the elimination of the differences between mental and manual labor are components of several basic conditions for the transition from socialism to communism. And to achieve these goals, it is clearly far from enough to rely solely on full-time schools run by the state. Therefore, we must implement the policy of running schools by the state and running schools by factories, mines, enterprises, and people's communes simultaneously, and the policy of running full-time schools and part-work, part-study schools and amateur schools simultaneously, which is the policy of "walking on two legs." It should be seen that amateur schools have a bright future. With the improvement of industrial and agricultural production technology and the development of industrial and agricultural production, working hours will be shortened. At this time, there will be no difference between amateur schools and part-work, part-study schools. The rapid development of amateur schools and part-work, part-study schools and their role in popularizing education and improving the political and ideological level of the workers and peasants are far from comparable to full-time schools run by the state. Clearly, this is the only way for the workers and peasants to become intellectuals. If our education cause does not have such a leg, it will be fundamentally impossible to make the communist ideological awareness and moral qualities of the entire people greatly improved, to popularize and improve universal education, to gradually eliminate the differences between manual and mental labor, that is, to transition to the communist era. Of course, in order to gradually eliminate the differences between manual and mental labor, it is also necessary to implement the policy of full-time schools running factories and farms, and students regularly participating in manual labor in people's communes, factories, mines, and enterprises. That is, we must implement the policy of intellectualizing labor. This policy has now been generally implemented and is achieving increasingly significant results.

From the above, it can be seen that as a Marxist-Leninist fighter, if he does not see the above great significance, if he does not regard the large-scale running of schools by factories, mines, enterprises, and people's communes as a major event of the entire party and the entire people, if he does not rely on the entire party and the entire people to run various forms of schools on a large scale, but only relies on certain business departments to run them, if he does not continuously and correctly implement the educational revolution in accordance with the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical, then it is inevitable to commit right-leaning opportunist errors.

More than 110 years ago, Marx and Engels put forward the great ideal of "combining education with material production" in the "Communist Manifesto." Lenin also wrote at the end of the last century: "Without the combination of the education of the younger generation and productive labor, the ideal of the future society is unimaginable. Neither teaching and education divorced from productive labor, nor productive labor without simultaneous teaching and education, can reach the level required by modern technology and the current state of scientific knowledge." Is this great ideal of Marx, Engels, and Lenin now being realized and becoming a living reality under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought at a rapid pace?

    工厂大办学校的伟大意义
    ——祝晋西机器厂大办业余学校取得的巨大成就
    中共山西省委第一书记　陶鲁笳
    我们所有的厂矿、企业能不能大办业余学校和半工半读学校，业余学校和半工半读学校能不能高速度、高质量地培养出工人阶级的知识分子？这是我国社会主义建设高速度发展向我们提出来的迫切问题。
    工厂办学校，这对于我们来说，并不是一件新闻。许多厂矿、企业，从解放以后，就举办有供职工子弟上学的全日制小学、职工业余扫盲学校、职工业余小学以及全日制的或者半工半读的技工学校和中等技术学校，等等。但是，工厂办学校这个概念，由比较狭隘的具有很大局限性的旧概念，发展到既是工厂又是学校，工厂在生产物质资料的同时必须培养共产主义新人的新概念，这还是1958年大跃进的产物。从那时起，经过两年来的实践证明，所有的厂矿、企业，不但可以大办业余小学、业余中学和半工半读的中学，而且可以大办业余和半工半读的高等学校（大厂可以一厂办数校，小厂可以数厂联合办一校）。一部分大型的厂矿、企业，还可以逐步建立从小学到大学的全日制的教育体系。同时，太原市晋西机器厂以及其他许多先进厂矿、企业的成功经验还证明，厂矿、企业举办的由低级到高级的业余学校和半工半读学校，完全能够高速度、高质量地培养出工人阶级的知识分子。由此可见，工厂办学校已经进到一个新的发展阶段。也就是说，它已经成为我国正在进行的伟大的文化革命运动的一个重要的组成部分了。很显然，所有厂矿、企业由低到高地大办各种形式的学校，尤其是大办职工业余学校，这是适应我国社会主义建设高速度发展的必然趋势。
    是不是所有的厂矿、企业的领导干部，对于工厂大办学校的这种必然趋势，都有了正确的认识呢？否。只要我们认真地进行一下比较和分析，就可以看到实际情况是这样的：对于工厂大办学校，大部分的领导干部表现干劲很足、方法对头，因而效果很大；一小部分的领导干部则表现忽冷忽热、办法保守，因而效果不大；另有极少数的领导干部，还根本没有把这个问题提到议事日程上来。显然，后面的这两种人，对于工厂大办学校这样的大事，还不能说已经有了正确的认识。他们还处在怀疑派或者半怀疑派的精神状态。照他们看来，工厂办学校，只能小办而不能大办。理由何在呢？无非是，工厂大办就要耽误生产呀，工厂大办学校缺乏师资、缺乏教材呀。因而他们得出的结论是，工厂大办学校，速度必慢，质量必低，“得不偿失”，等等。总之，在他们的面前是一堆“不可克服的困难”。其实，只要看一看晋西机器厂的生动事实，就可以一眼看他们的悲观论调不过是十足地反映了懒汉懦夫的世界观。
    晋西机器厂从1956年开始大办业余学校，到现在仅仅三、四年的时间，全厂职工的文化面貌和精神面貌已经发生了一个飞跃的变化。现在，这个厂真正做到了既是工厂，又是学校。全厂已有近90％的职工在各级各类学校学习。这些学校的形式是：业余的小学、中学、大学；半工半读的中等技术学校和工学院。另外还有一座全日制的中等技术学校。到目前为止，业余初中毕业的职工有三百零六人，业余高中和半工半读的中等技术学校毕业的职工有一百三十七人，业余的和半工半读的大学毕业的职工有五十四人（等于过去十年国家分配给这个厂的大专毕业生总数的74％）。在全厂职工中，文盲没有了。小学毕业程度的由1956年以前占职工总数的32％，上升到42％，初中和高中毕业程度的由1956年以前占职工总数的41％，上升到50％，大学毕业程度的由1956年以前占职工总数的2％，上升到8％。而且全厂有90％左右的职工组织了四百八十个毛泽东著作的学习小组，还建立了一个包括有四百多工人参加的理论讲师团。可见他们不但非常重视文化和科学技术的学习，同时也十分重视政治理论的学习。特别令人鼓舞的是，这个厂1958年举办的工学院，今年5月，培养出了第一批毕业生共四十三名。在这四十三名大学毕业生中，除开十二人原来是具有相当文化水平的技术人员以外，其余都是生产工人。他们之中有十个人（都是具有十年以上工龄的老工人），在1953年以前还是目不识丁的文盲。这十个人大约经过六年的业余学校的学习，就基本上达到了高中毕业的文化水平，又经过了在工学院一年零八个月的半工半读和最后三个月的脱离生产的学习，即用了全日制大学一半的时间，就达到了同等性质的全日制大学毕业生的水准。他们所作的毕业论文和毕业设计，同全日制大学的毕业生相比是毫无逊色的。而且他们在解决生产中有关科学技术问题的能力上远远超过一般大学生。这十个老工人的榜样，对于所有现在还处于文盲、半文盲或者文化程度还不高的工人群众是一个极好的启示。人们很自然地会问，既然他们能够以如此迅速的步伐攀登上科学文化知识的高峰，为什么和他们处于同样条件的人甚至比他们的条件更为优越的人不能做到呢？同时这十个老工人的榜样，对于所有厂矿、企业的领导干部也是一个极好的启示。由此使他们认识，在厂矿、企业逐步普及高等教育，并不是像那些庸夫俗子们看得那样神秘，那样高不可攀。现在，晋西机器厂举办的半工半读大学和业余大学，设有机械、冶金、电机、数学、物理、语文、医学、药学、俄文、企业管理等十个专业，共有八百多个学员。并且他们已经作了如下的规划：从今年下半年开始，争取一年普及初中，三年普及高中，七年普及大学。即到1966年，现有职工入大学学习和大学毕业的人将占现有职工总数的80％以上。可以预断他们的这个规划是完全可能实现的，而决不是没有根据的空想。
    所有以上这一切事实，雄辩地驳倒了那些怀疑派、半怀疑派所谓工厂大办学校，速度必慢、质量必低的谬论。
    工厂大办学校，就势必要耽误生产吗？晋西机器厂的事实，也恰好与此相反。工厂大办学校的结果，不是耽误了生产，而是大大促进了生产。这个厂从1957年11月以来，连续三十个月，全厂生产月月季季满堂红。很明显，他们把文化革命的洪流和技术革新、技术革命的洪流汇合成一股巨流了。所以职工群众的创造发明层出不穷。不但创造发明的数量越来越多，而且它的质量也越来越高。以这次工学院毕业的职工为例。他们在学习期间，共提出了三百一十九项技术革新的建议，现在已经实现了二百三十二项。这些革新建议的实现，使生产效率几十倍、几百倍甚至成千倍地增长了起来。他们在毕业的前夕又做出了八项具有重大价值的毕业设计，并且现在有五项已经付诸实现了。由此可见，工人群众的科学文化水平普及和提高起来了，他们在技术革命运动中，就像老虎添了翅膀一样，大显神通，从而不断地产生出一浪高过一浪的劳动生产率。难道这还用得着有任何的怀疑吗？
    工厂大办学校缺乏教材、缺乏师资，这些困难无法克服吗？说到教材和师资，晋西机器厂的条件，并不比其他厂矿、企业有什么特别优越之处。他们在大办学校的过程中，的确也碰到了这些困难。然而他们没有向困难低头，而采取大胆的革命精神，把这些困难一个一个地一步一步地战胜了。在改革学制、课程、教材和教学方法等问题上，他们曾经遇到来自具有资产阶级教育观点的人们的抵抗。这些人散布种种谬论，说什么：“业余学校和半工半读学校必须像现在一般的全日制学校那样去办，才算正规。”“教科书是专家权威人士编写的，改动不得。”“教学大纲是法律，是神圣不可侵犯的。”等等。总之，他们装着“内行”的模样来吓唬人。他们对于资产阶级遗留下来的那一套脱离实际、脱离生产的学制、课程、教材和教学方法，不敢越过雷池一步。工人群众对于他们的这种资产阶级观点，给了一针见血的尖锐批评。工人群众说：“业余学校走的正规路，大人念的儿童书，课程多，进度慢，用不上，学不完。”正是这样，晋西机器厂依靠工人群众开展了多快好省和少慢差费的两条路线的斗争。他们在学制、课程、教材和教学方法等各个方面，根据工厂办学校必须结合生产、联系实际、适合成人特点、学以致用的原则和多快好省的方针，采取不断革命的精神和群众路线的工作方法，大胆地进行了各种改革的尝试。经过这样大胆的尝试，他们开始摸索到了一条多快好省的正确道路。当然，这条道路还有待于在实践中继续检验和发展，以便使之逐步趋于完善。但是，他们所采取的一系列的教学改革的措施，已经取得显著的效果，铁的事实使那些少慢差费论者终究不能不认输。在解决师资缺乏的问题上，他们同样是采取革命的办法。这就是除了从全厂技职人员中抽调一批称职的专职教师和从厂内厂外聘请兼职教师以外，特别重视在工人中培养和选择师资。现在工人担任兼职教师的已经达到一百六十多人，占兼职教师总数的45％。他们受到了学员的热烈欢迎。第一个走上讲台的工人教师、五级电工常安同志，由于他已经具有相当的文化水平，又有丰富的实践知识，并且熟知工人的心理和要求，所以他在给中等技术学校的学员讲解物理课中远距离输电和变压器的原理时，既生动、又具体，受到学员的一致赞扬。而过去许多知识分子出身的教师，讲解这个原理时，学员们费尽心机，还是落个不得要领。由此可见，既然师资可以来自工人群众，那么师资缺乏的困难也就可以迎刃而解了。当然，对于这一点，具有资产阶级教育观点的人是不会相信的。然而晋西机器厂的事实确是如此。
    应当指出，对于工厂大办学校这件事，至今还抱有怀疑派或者半怀疑派的观点的人，他们的病根还在于他们不了解工厂大办学校和必须实行教育革命的伟大意义。究竟有哪些伟大的意义呢？根据以上所述，指出下列的几点是有必要的：
    第一，它是促进技术革命运动高速度、高质量地不断向前发展的基础，因而也是保证社会主义建设持续大跃进的一个不可缺少的条件。社会主义的厂矿、企业，不仅应当努力生产物的产品，更重要的还要努力培养共产主义的新人。因为人的产品的质量，直接影响和决定着物的产品。所以只有使人们的共产主义觉悟和科学文化水平普遍地不断地提高起来，才能在由建设社会主义并向共产主义过渡的长时期内实现连续的生产大跃进。
    第二，厂矿、企业是贯彻执行党中央提出的教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育同生产劳动相结合这一教育方针的最好的场所，是根据这一教育方针实行教育革命的最好的场所。只要所有的厂矿、企业以至所有城乡人民公社都大办起学校来，并且不断地正确地实行教学改革，那末，广大工农群众的科学文化水平和马克思列宁主义的理论水平，就都会飞跃地提高起来。我们也就可以多快好省地实现党中央曾经指出过的文化革命的主要任务之一，即“建立一支成千万人的工人阶级的知识分子队伍，其中包括技术干部的队伍（这是数量最大的）、教授、教员、科学家、新闻记者、文学家、艺术家和马克思主义理论家的队伍。”
    第三，党中央关于在农村建立人民公社问题的决议中指出的，全体人民的共产主义的思想觉悟和道德品质的极大提高，全民教育的普及和提高，脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别的消失，是由社会主义过渡到共产主义的若干基本条件的组成部分。而要实现这些目标，仅仅依靠国家举办的全日制学校显然是大大不够的。所以，必须实行国家办学与厂矿、企业、人民公社办学并举，全日制学校与半工半读、业余学校并举的方针，也就是“两条腿走路”的方针。应当看到，业余学校有远大的前途，随着工业和农业生产技术的提高，随着工农业生产的发展，劳动时间将会缩短，这时候，业余学校和半工半读的学校就没有区别了。业余学校和半工半读学校发展的迅猛和普及教育、提高工农群众的政治思想水平的作用，远非国家举办的全日制学校所能比拟。很显然，这是工农群众知识化的必由之路。我们的教育事业如果没有这样一条腿，要想使全体人民的共产主义的思想觉悟和道德品质有极大的提高，全民教育作到普及和提高，体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别逐步消失，也就是说，要想过渡到共产主义时代，是根本不可能的。当然，为了使体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别逐步消失，还必须在全日制学校实行办工厂、办农场，学生定期到人民公社、厂矿、企业参加体力劳动的方针。也就是必须实行知识分子劳动化的方针。这个方针，现在也已经普遍实行起来并且取得越来越显著的效果。
    由上可知，作为一个马克思列宁主义的战士，如果看不到上述这些伟大的意义，如果不把厂矿、企业和人民公社大办学校看作是全党全民的大事情，如果不依靠全党全民去大办各种形式的学校，而仅仅依靠某些业务部门去办，如果不按照多快好省的方针，不断地正确地实行教育革命，那就不可避免地要犯右倾机会主义的错误。
    一百一十多年以前，马克思和恩格斯在“共产党宣言”中就提出了“把教育同物质生产结合起来”的伟大理想。列宁在上一世纪末也曾写道：“没有年轻一代的教育和生产劳动的结合，未来的社会的理想是不能想像的。无论是脱离生产劳动的教学和教育，或是没有同时进行教学和教育的生产劳动，都不能达到现代技术水平和科学知识现状所要求的高度。”马克思、恩格斯和列宁的这个伟大理想，现在，我们不是正在毛泽东思想的光辉的照耀下，一日千里地实现了，而成为活生生的现实了生活吗？
