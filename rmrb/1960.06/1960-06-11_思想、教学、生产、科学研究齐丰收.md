    A Bumper Harvest in Ideology, Teaching, Production, and Scientific Research
    Wu Zimu, Representative of Xishiqiao Agricultural Middle School, Jiangyin County, Jiangsu Province

    For more than two years, under the leadership of the Party and with the care and love of the broad masses, Xishiqiao Agricultural Middle School in Jiangyin County, Jiangsu Province, has gone through the process of establishment, development, consolidation, improvement, re-development, and re-consolidation and improvement. It has become a school of a certain size with nine classes and 536 students. The consolidation and improvement of agricultural middle schools is a major victory in defeating bourgeois educational thought, a victory for the Party's general line of building socialism, a victory for the Party's education policy, and a victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

    I
    In more than two years of work, we have deeply realized that it is of great significance for agricultural middle schools to engage in production for self-sufficiency. Achieving production self-sufficiency can reduce the expenses of the state, the commune, and the students' families. Achieving production self-sufficiency can lay a solid material foundation for the consolidation, development, and improvement of agricultural middle schools. It can also accumulate funds for the commune and create more material wealth for the country. Since the Provincial Party Committee put forward the call for agricultural middle schools to strive to achieve production self-sufficiency, we have adopted the principle of "adapting to local conditions, using simple methods, starting with indigenous methods, proceeding from the easy to the difficult, and gradually improving" since April last year, and have vigorously engaged in production for self-sufficiency. Now, the production of agriculture, industry, and sideline occupations in our school has taken initial shape.

    (1) Under the guidance of focusing on sideline occupations (handicrafts) and high-yield cash crops, and implementing a policy of combining agriculture and sideline occupations, we have comprehensively arranged the production of industry, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, and have consolidated the normal teaching and labor order. Our school's existing production bases include 400 mu of cultivated land, of which 92 mu are for field crops, accounting for about 25% of the cultivated land area, 250 mu are for orchards, and 58 mu are for vegetables and fodder, totaling about 75%. More than 200 heads of livestock such as pigs and sheep are raised, as well as more than 2,000 poultry such as chickens, ducks, and rabbits, and 50,000 fish. Handicrafts include several small factories such as a machinery repair shop, an instrument bearing factory, a glass instrument factory, a chemical factory, and a tile and carpentry factory. In addition, there are five reserve workshops for seasonal production and production during rainy days, such as brick blanks, straw sandals, straw curtains, cattail bags, and straw bags, to ensure that there is work in all seasons and arrangements for both sunny and rainy days. Students participating in industrial production study industry during normal times and engage in agriculture during busy seasons, while students participating in agricultural production cultivate fields on sunny days and enter factories on rainy days. This achieves a rational use of labor, flexible allocation of time, changes the phenomenon of excessive crash work in production, consolidates the normal teaching and labor order, and ensures that teaching and production promote each other.

    (2) In terms of production scale and technology, it has developed from indigenous methods to modern methods, and from manual operation to mechanized and semi-mechanized operation. Students can learn various processes such as lathe work, forging, and welding, and master the skills of manufacturing and repairing simple mechanical parts and some electrical equipment. In this way, students not only learn knowledge and skills in agricultural production, but also learn and master certain knowledge and skills related to machinery, electricity, etc., creating favorable conditions for realizing agricultural technical transformation and cultivating technical reserve forces.

    (3) The industrial production base has been initially expanded, some modern production equipment has been added, and the school's economic income has been greatly increased. After the Jiangsu Provincial Agricultural Middle School Advanced Units and Advanced Workers Representative Conference in December last year, we overcame various difficulties according to the principle of serving local agricultural production, and established small factories such as a machinery repair shop, a chemical factory, and a glass instrument factory in just over four months. In addition, cash crops were planted in the farmland, and intensive cultivation was implemented, which led to an increase in yields and a significant increase in income. Through careful accounting and the formulation of measures, all teachers and students established ambitious goals and strived to achieve the annual output value target of 500,000 yuan.

    (4) With the continuous increase in production income, the scope of supply and collective welfare are gradually expanding. Since January this year, we have adjusted teachers' salaries from self-sufficiency expenditure. Students, regardless of whether they are new or old, enjoy free books, notebooks, and meals. At the same time, safety protection equipment and health care equipment have been improved, further improving the lives of teachers and students and stimulating students' enthusiasm for learning.

    To do a good job in production self-sufficiency in agricultural middle schools, we deeply realize that: we must conscientiously study Chairman Mao's thought of continuous revolution, resolutely listen to the Party's words, rely on the masses, give play to subjective initiative, seize the favorable situation in each period, actively create conditions, overcome all difficulties, and continuously push production self-sufficiency forward. In the winter of 1958, after the people's communes were established, the school shifted from decentralization to centralization, and students shifted from working mainly outside the school to working mainly inside the school. We seized this favorable opportunity. In addition to agricultural labor, we used the method of exchanging straw shoes for rice straw to obtain some rice straw, which was woven into straw bags and sold to supply and marketing cooperatives. In addition, we made brick blanks for brick factories and obtained some income to purchase ink, paper, and chalk for teaching. In the spring of 1959, the Provincial Party Committee put forward the policy of production self-sufficiency for agricultural middle schools, pointing out the important significance of agricultural middle schools doing a good job in production labor and striving for self-sufficiency. Teachers and students took production self-sufficiency as a goal of struggle. After smashing the "theory of conditions," they established several handicraft workshops for straw shoes, straw bags, cattail bags, farm tools, and carpentry on the basis of weaving straw bags and making brick blanks, using simple methods and indigenous methods. At the same time, the Commune Party Committee gave us strong support, allocating an additional 400 mu of land and sending old farmers to the school to provide technical guidance. In this way, production self-sufficiency was carried out vigorously. In June last year, Comrade Chen Guang, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, came to our school for inspection for the second time. Based on the characteristics of agricultural middle schools, from the perspective of being conducive to self-sufficiency, conducive to teaching, and suitable for the age characteristics of students, he pointed out that the production layout of agricultural middle schools is suitable for focusing on sideline occupations (handicrafts) and high-yield cash crops, and implementing a policy of combining agriculture and sideline occupations. We immediately focused on sideline production, expanded and improved the original workshops, changed hand-woven straw bags to iron and wood machine-woven straw bags, expanded the instrument bearing factory, and added a hardware factory. In agricultural production, we adjusted the production layout and expanded the area of cash crops. By implementing this policy, the school's production self-sufficiency greatly improved, and it achieved full self-sufficiency by October. The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party issued a call to oppose rightism and boost morale, and put forward the task of accelerating the realization of agricultural technical transformation. At the Jiangsu Provincial Agricultural Middle School Advanced Units and Advanced Workers Representative Conference, the Provincial Party Committee called on all agricultural middle schools in the province to "catch up with ordinary middle schools in teaching, be pioneers in production, and make teachers and students ideologically red and professional." We boosted our morale, and with the help of the county and commune Party committees, we equipped ourselves with power. On the basis of the hardware factory, we adopted the method of producing while expanding to establish a machinery repair shop, and added a glass instrument factory and a chemical factory. In agricultural production, we strengthened management, carefully cultivated, and achieved production gardenization, which made new progress in production self-sufficiency.

    In order to build factories, we also encountered obstacles in our thinking, and encountered many difficulties in terms of equipment and funds. At first, some comrades were worried that the scale was too large, the projects were too many, and there was no one to guide them, and they were afraid that they would not be able to do it. Comrades in charge of agricultural production believed that "farming is already tiring enough, how can we have the energy to engage in industry?" and said how to solve the problems of equipment, funds, and technology. We immediately started with situational education, explaining that agricultural middle schools engaging in production are not only pursuing economic value, but also have far-reaching significance in cultivating technical talents and cultivating new-type intellectuals who are both red and expert. We focused on debating the significance of agricultural middle schools entering a new stage and the new tasks they shoulder in the new situation. In this way, we achieved a clear understanding of the situation and liberated our thinking. Where did the production funds come from? We first seized the production of the original factories, increased output, saved raw materials, reduced costs, and expanded capital accumulation. On the one hand, we tightened our expenses, and on the other hand, we repaid some equipment funds in installments. For some production projects, we adopted the method of collecting deposits in advance. We followed the spirit of accumulating small amounts to make a large amount, accumulating sand to form a tower, and saving money as soon as we had it, and did everything possible to gradually lay the foundation for expanding and building new factories. How to solve the problem of technical strength? With the strong support of the County Party Committee and the Commune Party Committee, we implemented factory-school cooperation. We used the method of "inviting people in to teach" and "sending people out to study" to solve it. Regarding the purchase and sale of raw materials and products, according to the principle of serving local agricultural production, we tried our best to incorporate them into the production plans of the commune and the county, and focused on cooperating with factories and enterprises in the county and commune to ensure the normal operation of production. This is how our school's road to production self-sufficiency has come about.

    Students' collectivist spirit and communist style have been further cultivated in labor. In the distribution of income, we resolutely changed the practice of "evaluating work and assigning points, and distributing according to work," and adopted the principle of collective labor, joint enjoyment, and mainly meeting the collective needs of the school for distribution. Students' collectivist thinking has been significantly improved. Now, what everyone cares about is no longer the number of individual work points, but the collective interests of more than 500 students in the school. Student Huang Meizhen burned her foot in labor and was staying in the hospital. She asked her classmates to help her to the school to see what was going on. She said, "The school is changing every day. If I don't go to the school to see it for a few days, I feel like something is wrong and I can't let it go." The students thought: studying doesn't cost money, and we eat and live at school. If we don't work hard, it's like exploiting other people's labor results. Therefore, in labor, they can do everything, such as transporting manure to plant vegetables, accumulating fertilizer to improve the soil, harvesting rice and threshing, and everyone is eager to be the first. The qualities of caring for the collective, loving life, and using both hands and brains are shining on them.

    II

    Agricultural middle school is a new type of school that is half-work and half-study. It must not only produce well, but also teach well. Doing a good job in teaching can enable the younger generation to accept modern cultural and scientific knowledge and cultivate qualified talents for the commune. At the beginning, some people thought that agricultural middle schools, with half-work and half-study, could not learn anything and the quality of teaching could not be improved. However, we resolutely implemented the half-work and half-study system, properly arranged the time for teaching and production labor according to the age characteristics of the students, and established a teaching order with the characteristics of agricultural middle schools. Because our school is a school where study, labor, and life are all collectivized, and we have initially established our own production base; in addition, all 14 teachers are young students and have a strong desire to be red in agricultural middle schools and specialized in agriculture. They eat, live, and work with the students and establish a new comrade-like teacher-student relationship; most of the students are from poor and lower-middle peasant families (poor and middle peasants account for 94%), and they are also more conscious in their studies; these conditions are conducive to us improving the quality of teaching. In teaching, we firmly grasp the principle of "systematic improvement and integration with practice." Each grade offers political, language, mathematics, and agricultural knowledge courses. With the different grades, we added physics and chemistry in cultural courses, and constantly supplemented new teaching content from newspapers and periodicals in language courses; thus, we constantly improved students' cultural knowledge level. With the different content of labor, we supplemented animal husbandry, fattening, breeding of fine varieties, veterinary medicine (first grade), fruit tree cultivation, lathe work, fitter work, planer work (second grade), and agricultural meteorology, agricultural machinery (third grade), as well as professional knowledge such as soil pesticides and fertilizers in agricultural knowledge courses. In particular, running factories on a large scale, carrying out technical innovation on a large scale, and carrying out scientific research on a large scale have further stimulated students' desire for knowledge and expanded their knowledge field. Of course, the process of improving the quality of teaching has also gone through a period of study and struggle. Because the teachers in our school are all young students and are unfamiliar with teaching, we adopted the methods of "sending them out" (sending teachers to ordinary middle schools to listen to cultural courses, sending teachers and students to learn agricultural meteorology), "inviting them in" (inviting ordinary middle school teachers to demonstrate teaching, inviting technicians from scientific research institutions and farms to teach at the school), cooperating with ordinary middle schools (conducting two teaching and research activities with ordinary middle schools every week), and leading teachers and students to go deep into practice to enrich teachers' perceptual knowledge and improve the quality of teaching. For example, Teacher Cao Hanguo had never learned agricultural knowledge before, but after hard study, he was able to conduct teaching creatively. When teaching "the nature and effect of fertilizers," he led the students to study and discuss, and proposed to manufacture a comprehensive fertilizer including the three elements of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Just a few days before teaching, they found peat containing nitrogen on the river embankment, and analyzed that grass ash contained potassium, stove soil contained potassium and nitrogen, and shells contained phosphorus. Therefore, they used seven or eight kinds of free raw materials to make a three-element soil fertilizer. After the three-wheat fertilization test, the wheat in the field where soil fertilizer was applied was two or three inches higher than the wheat in other fields, and it grew slowly and oily. Everyone who passed this field was surprised and said: "Why does this field grow so well this year?" This is an example of our teachers improving and improving teaching through production practice. Mathematics teachers also try their best to apply mathematical knowledge to production practice. Mathematics teacher Yang Maohua taught mathematics courses on measuring earthwork and led students to practice. Students reflected: "This has brought the knowledge in the books to life. We have not only learned knowledge, but also learned how to measure in practice, which has greatly consolidated the learning results." In terms of language teaching, language teachers have also created experiences to improve language teaching. Twenty-two-year-old young teacher Yu Chengliang started teaching language courses. Because he didn't know how to teach, he once escaped from the classroom. Now, through learning and teaching, he has learned "grasping ideology (mastering the ideological content of the教材and the ideological conditions of the students), grasping new materials" (in addition to the content of the textbooks, he often pays attention to supplementing new教材, such as "Xiang Xiuli" and "Let's See How the Rivers and Mountains Are Rebuilt Today"), "grasping the integration with practice" (leading students to write articles on production and social activities), and "grasping the reform of teaching methods" These four links have enabled students' language level to improve rapidly. In short, we have begun to explore four links to improve the quality of teaching, namely: first, we must grasp ideology, second, we must grasp the improvement of teachers, third, we must grasp the integration with practice, and fourth, we must grasp the improvement of the degree. Therefore, students' scores have been continuously improved in the past two years. In particular, since this semester, the total average score of mathematics and language in junior high school has risen to more than 80 points after several stage tests, basically eliminating the phenomenon of failing grades, and initially catching up with the teaching level of ordinary middle schools held in the same period. Because teaching is closely integrated with production practice, and the content of labor is relatively comprehensive and extensive, students' knowledge field is more extensive and rich. Students not only learn the knowledge in books, but also learn production skills, and truly achieve learning for application. In breeding management, 45 students have mastered the management knowledge of fattening pigs and preventing general diseases of pigs, so the survival rate of pigs has been increased to more than 98%; in agricultural production, nearly half of the students have basically mastered the cultivation technology of three-wheat rice, and 182 people have mastered 15 methods of preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests; in industrial production, 30 people have initially mastered the operation technology of lathe work, fitter work, and foundry work, 17 people have learned to manufacture glass instruments, and 28 people have learned carpentry work, of which 12 people have already caught up with the level of master craftsmen. Scientific research, combined with production and teaching, has been better developed. The school has established four stations, under the scientific research institute, there are new agricultural tool promotion station, disease and insect pest control station, animal husbandry and veterinary station and meteorological station.

    III

    The practice of more than two years has proved that putting politics in command, doing a good job in labor production, and improving the quality of teaching are two interrelated and important keys to consolidating and improving agricultural middle schools. Therefore, agricultural middle schools have played an increasingly significant role in cultivating talents needed by the commune and conducting agricultural scientific research and promoting advanced production skills.

    This year is the third year of running agricultural middle schools. Our school has 76 graduates this year, who will be assigned to various fronts by the commune. According to the commune's preliminary plan, 30 people will be sent to schools in the first grade of high school, 8 people will be arranged to work in the commune's meteorological station, veterinary station, and scientific research institute, and 38 people will serve as brigade accountants, spare-time school teachers, and agricultural technicians. Now we are strengthening the guidance of the first graduates in accordance with the spirit of the Provincial Party Committee's instructions to ensure that we cultivate the first batch of qualified talents needed by the country and the commune.

    In our work, we deeply realize that listening to the Party's words and acting in accordance with the Party's instructions is the guarantee of victory in all our work. The continuous growth and expansion of our Xishiqiao Agricultural Middle School is the result of acting in accordance with the Party's instructions. In the future, under the leadership of the Party, under the brilliant light of the three red banners, and under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we will advance side by side with agricultural middle schools across the country, ordinary middle schools, and spare-time middle schools, and cultivate more new-type proletarian intellectuals with socialist and communist consciousness and a certain level of culture needed by the country and the commune in a faster, better, and more economical way, and contribute all our strength to the great goal of accelerating the intellectualization of the working people and eliminating the difference between mental and physical labor.

    思想、教学、生产、科学研究齐丰收
    江苏省江阴县西石桥农业中学代表　吴子沐
    两年多来，江苏省江阴县西石桥农业中学在党的领导、广大群众的关心、爱护之下，经过了创办、发展、巩固提高，再发展、再巩固提高的过程，已经成为一所具有九个班，五百三十六个学生的一定规模的学校。农业中学的巩固提高是战胜资产阶级教育思想的一个重大胜利，是党的建设社会主义总路线的胜利，是党的教育方针的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利。
    一
    在两年多的工作中，我们深深体会到，农业中学搞生产自给有着重大的意义。实现生产
  自给，可以减轻国家、公社和学生家庭的开支。实现生产自给，可以为农业中学的巩固发展和提高，奠定雄厚的物质基础。它还可以为公社积累资金，为国家创造更多的物质财富。自从省委提出了农业中学力争实现生产自给的号召，我们从去年4月份起，采取了“因地制宜，因陋就简，土法上马，先易后难，逐步提高”的原则，大搞生产自给。现在我校农、工业副业的生产已初具规模。
    （一）在以副业（手工业）和高产经济作物为主，实行农副业并举的方针下，全面地安排了工、农、林、牧、副、渔的生产，巩固了正常的教学和劳动秩序。我校现有的生产基地，有耕地四百亩，其中大田作物九十二亩，占耕地面积25％左右，果园二百五十亩，蔬菜、饲料田五十八亩，共计占75％左右。饲养猪、羊等家畜二百多头，鸡、鸭、兔等家禽两千多只，鱼五万尾。手工业有机械修配厂、仪表轴承厂、玻璃仪器厂、化工厂和瓦木工厂等几个小型工厂。此外，还有季节性和调剂阴雨天生产的砖坯、草鞋、草帘、蒲包、草包等五个后备工场，做到四季有工作，晴雨有安排。参加工业生产的学生是平时学工、大忙搞农，参加农业生产的学生是晴天种田，雨天进厂。这样做到了合理地使用劳力，灵活地支配时间，改变了生产上突击过多的现象，巩固了正常的教学和劳动秩序，做到教学、生产相互促进。
    （二）在生产规模和技术上已经由土到洋，由手工操作发展到机械化、半机械化的操作。学生可以学习到车工、锻工、焊工等各种工艺，掌握制造和修理简单的机械零件和电气上的一些装备的技能。这样，学生不仅学到了农业生产方面的知识和技能，并将学习和掌握某些有关机械、电气等方面的知识和技能，为实现农业技术改造、培养技术后备力量创造了优越的条件。
    （三）初步扩大了工业生产基地，增添了部分现代生产设备，大大增加了学校的经济收入。在去年12月江苏省农业中学先进单位和先进工作者代表会议以后，我们根据为当地农业生产服务的方针，克服种种困难，在短短的四个多月中，先后建立了机械修配厂、化工厂、玻璃仪器厂等小型工厂。加上农田上种植了经济作物，实行精耕细作，这就带来了产量的提高，使收入有了很大增长。通过算细账，定措施，全校师生树立了雄心壮志，力争实现全年产值五十万元的指标。
    （四）随着生产收益的不断增加，供给范围和集体福利正逐步扩大。从今年1月份起，我们在自给经费支出中，调整了教师工资。学生不分新、旧生，一律享受书籍、簿本和伙食等的免费待遇。同时改善了安全保护设备和卫生医疗设备，进一步提高了师生生活，激发了学生学习的积极性。
    要搞好农业中学生产自给，我们深深体会到：一定要很好地学习毛主席的不断革命的思想，坚决听党的话，依靠群众，发挥主观能动性，抓着各个时期的有利形势，积极创造条件，克服一切困难，将生产自给不断推向前进。1958年冬天，在人民公社化以后，学校由分散走向集中，学生从校外劳动为主走向校内劳动为主，我们抓着了这个有利时机，除进行农业劳动外，就以打草鞋换稻草的办法，搞到一些稻草，编成草包，出售给供销社。另外替砖窑厂制砖坯，得到一些收入，给教学上添置墨水、纸张、粉笔。1959年春天，省委提出了农业中学生产自给的方针，指出了农业中学搞好生产劳动，争取自给的重要意义后，师生们把生产自给作为奋斗目标，大破“唯条件论”以后，就在编草包打砖坯的基础上，因陋就简、土法上马，办起了草鞋、草包、蒲包、农具、木工等几个手工工场。同时，公社党委给予我们大力支持，增拨土地四百亩，派老农到校作技术指导，生产自给就这样轰轰烈烈地搞起来了。去年6月间，省委书记陈光同志第二次来我校视察，根据农业中学特点，从有利于自给，有利于教学，适合学生年龄特点出发，指出了农业中学生产布局适宜于以副业（手工业）和高产经济作物为主，实行农副业并举。我们即大抓副业生产，扩大和改进原有工场，将手编草包改为铁木机织草包，扩大了仪表轴承厂，新添了五金工厂，在农业生产上调整了生产布局，扩大经济作物面积。执行了这个方针，学校的生产自给大有起色，到10月份即实现了全部自给。党的八届八中全会发出了反右倾、鼓干劲的号召，提出加速实现农业技术改造的任务。在江苏省农业中学先进单位和先进工作者代表会议上，省委号召全省农业中学“教学赶普中，生产当先锋，师生思想红又红”。我们大鼓干劲，在县和公社党委的帮助下，装备了动力，在五金工厂的基础上采取边生产、边扩建的办法，建立起机械修配厂，增加了玻璃仪器厂、化工厂等。在农业生产上，加工管理、精心培植，做到了生产园田化，使生产自给取得了新的进展。
    为了建厂，我们在思想上也曾遇到阻碍，设备上和资金上都曾遇到不少的困难。起初有的同志顾虑摊子大、项目多、无人指导，怕搞不了。管农业生产的同志，认为“种田已经够累了，哪有精力再搞工业”，又说设备、资金、技术如何解决等等。我们即从形势教育入手，说明农业中学搞生产不只是追求经济价值，而且在培养技术人才、培养又红又专的新型知识分子上有着深远的意义。着重辩论了在新的形势下，农业中学本身进入新阶段和它担负的新任务的意义。这样，做到了认清形势、解放思想。生产资金从哪里来？我们首先抓住原有工厂的生产，提高产量，节约原料，降低成本，扩大资金积累。一方面紧缩开支，对有些设备资金，则分期归还。有些生产项目，采取预收定金。我们本着积少成多，聚沙成塔，有钱即存的精神，千方百计地为扩建、新建工厂逐步打下了基础。技术力量如何办？我们在县委和公社党委的大力支持下，实行厂校挂钩。用“请进来教”和“派出去学”的办法来解决。对于原料和产品的购销问题，根据为当地农业生产服务的原则，尽量争取纳入公社和县的生产计划，有重点的与县、社工厂和企业挂钩，保证了生产的正常进行。我校的生产自给的道路，就是这样走过来的。
    在劳动中进一步培养了学生的集体主义精神，和共产主义风格。在收益分配上，我们坚决改变了“评工论分、按劳分配”的做法，采取了集体劳动、共同享受，以满足学校集体需要为主来进行分配的原则，学生的集体主义思想已有了显著的提高。现在每个人所关心的已经不是个人的工分多少，而是全校五百多个同学的集体利益。学生黄梅珍在劳动中烫伤了脚，住在医院中，她还要叫同学扶她到学校来看看，她说：“学校天天在变样，几天不到学校中看看，心里好像有着一件什么事似的，放不下心来。”同学们心中想：读书不要钱，吃、住都在学校，如果不好好劳动，等于剥削了别人的劳动成果。因而在劳动上，他们运粪种菜，积肥垩田，割稻脱粒等，样样能做，人人争先。关心集体，热爱生活和手脑并用的新人的品质，在他们身上闪露着光芒。
    二
    农业中学是半工半读的新型学校，不仅要生产好，并且要教学好。搞好教学，才能使青年一代接受现代的文化科学知识，为公社培养
  合乎规格的人才。开始，也有人认为农业中学半工半读学不到东西，教学质量提不高，但是，我们坚决地贯彻半工半读制度，根据学生的年龄特点，妥善地安排了教学与生产劳动的时间，建立起具有农业中学特点的教学秩序。由于我们学校是一所学习、劳动、生活都集体化了的学校，并且初步建立了自己的生产基地；加之，十四个教师都是青年学生出身，都有红在农中专在农中的强烈愿望，他们与学生同吃同住同劳动，建立起新的同志式的师生关系；学生中贫雇农子弟较多（贫中农占94％），学习自觉性也较高；这些条件均有利于我们提高教学质量。在教学上我们紧紧掌握“系统提高，结合实际”的原则，各年级均开设了政治、语文、数学、农业知识。随着年级的不同，在文化课方面我们增设了物理化学，在语文课方面还不断补充报纸刊物上新的教学内容；从而不断提高学生的文化知识水平。随着劳动内容的不同，农业知识课方面补充了动物饲养、育肥、培养良种、兽医（一年级）、果树栽培、车工、钳工、刨工（二年级）和农业气象、农业机械（三年级）以及土农药、肥料等专业知识。特别是大办工厂，大搞技术革新，大搞科学研究，更加激发了学生的求知欲望和扩大了学生的知识领域。当然，在提高教学质量的过程中，也是经过一番学习和斗争的。由于我们学校教师都是青年学生出身，对教学都是生疏的，但是我们采取“派出去”（送教师去普中听文化课，派师生去学农业气象）、“请进来”（请普中教师来示范教学，请科学研究机关和农场的技术员来校上课）、同普中挂钩（每周与普中进行两次教研活动）和领导教师学生深入实际等办法，来丰富教师的感性知识，以提高教学质量。如曹汉国老师原来未学过农业知识，但是他经过苦学苦钻，就能够创造性地进行教学。在教“肥料的性质和效用”时，他领导学生边学边讨论，并提出制造包括氮磷钾三种元素的综合性肥料，正好，在教学前几天他们在河工上发现有泥炭，其中有氮，又分析草木灰里有钾，灶土里有钾和氮，贝壳里有磷，因而就用七、八种不花钱的原料制成了三元素的土化肥。经过三麦施肥试验，施了土化肥的田里的麦子比其他田里的高二三寸，而且慢慢地长得黑油油的，凡是经过这块田的人都惊奇地说：“这块田今年怎么长得这么出色？”这就是我们教师通过生产实践改进和提高教学的一个实例。数学教师也尽量把数学知识运用到生产实践中去，数学教师杨茂华上过测量土方的数学课并率领学生进行实践，学生都反映：“这下把书本知识学活了，不但学了知识，还会实际测量，大大巩固了学习成果”。在语文教学方面，语文老师也创造了提高语文教学的经验，二十二岁青年教师俞承良开始上语文课，由于不会教，曾从课堂逃下来，现在他通过边学边教，学会了“抓思想（掌握教材的思想性和学生的思想状况）、抓新材料”（除了课文内容外，并经常注意补充新的教材，如“向秀丽”、“且看今日河山再造”等）、“抓结合实际”（领导学生写作生产和社会活动等题材的文章）、“抓改革教学方法”四个环节，因而使学生语文水平迅速提高。总之，我们在教学上已开始摸索出提高质量的四个环节，即：一要抓思想，二要抓提高教师，三要抓结合实际，四要抓提高程度，因而两年来学生的成绩不断提高，特别是本学期来，初三数学和语文经过几次阶段测验，总平均成绩已经上升到八十分以上，基本上消灭了不及格的现象，初步赶上了同期举办的普通中学的教学水平。由于教学紧密结合生产实际，加之劳动内容比较全面、广泛、学生的知识领域更加广泛丰富，学生不仅学到书本上的知识，而且学到了生产技能，真正做到了学以致用。在饲养管理上，有四十五个学生掌握了猪的育肥和防治猪的一般疾病的管理知识，因而猪的成活率提高到98％以上；在农业生产上已有近半数同学基本上掌握了三麦水稻的栽培技术，有一百八十二人掌握了十五种防治病虫害的方法；在工业生产上，有三十人初步掌握了车工、钳工、铸工等操作技术，有十七人学会制造玻璃仪器，有二十八人学会了瓦木工，其中十二人已经赶上老师傅的水平。科学研究结合生产和教学，有了更好的发展。学校成立了一所四站，在科学研究所下面设新式农具推广站、病虫害防治站、畜牧兽医站和气象站。

    两年多来的实践证明，政治挂帅，搞好劳动生产，和提高教学质量是巩固和提高农业中学的两个互相联系的重要关键，因而使农业中学在培养公社所需要的人才和进行农业科学研究推广先进生产技能方面，已经愈来愈发挥其巨大的作用。
    今年已是创办农业中学的第三年了，我们学校今年有毕业生七十六人，即将被公社分配到各条战线上去。据公社初步打算，输送升入高一年级学校的三十人，安排到公社气象站、兽医站、科研所有八人，担任大队会计、业余学校教员、农业技术员的有三十八人。现在我们正在按照省委指示精神，加强第一届毕业生的指导工作，保证培养出第一届为国家和公社所需要的合格人才。
    在工作中，我们深切体会到，听党的话，按照党的指示办事，是一切工作胜利的保证。我们西石桥农业中学的不断成长壮大，正是按照党的指示办事的结果。今后在党的领导下，在三面红旗的光辉照耀下，在毛泽东思想的指引下，我们将和全国农业中学一样，同普通中学、业余中学并肩前进，多快好省地培养出更多的符合国家和公社所需要的具有社会主义、共产主义觉悟的有一定文化的新型的无产阶级知识分子，为加速劳动人民知识化，为消灭脑力劳动与体力劳动差别的伟大目标，贡献出一切力量。
