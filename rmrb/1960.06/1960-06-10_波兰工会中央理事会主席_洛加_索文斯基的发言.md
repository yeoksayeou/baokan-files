Xinhua News Agency, June 9th – Loga-Sowinski, Vice-Chairman of the World Federation of Trade Unions and Chairman of the Polish Central Council of Trade Unions, spoke at the World Federation of Trade Unions Council meeting on the morning of June 8th.

    Loga-Sowinski began by saying that Polish workers, like working people all over the world, have expressed their indignation and condemned the US imperialist bloc's obstruction of the summit conference. Polish trade unions and the masses of the people support the counterattack against the forces of the Cold War. The Polish trade unions and the masses of the people support the position taken by Comrade Khrushchev, which is the only correct position, and it opens the way for a new stage in the struggle to ease international tensions and to prevent any provocations or acts of aggression in international relations.

    He said that our World Federation of Trade Unions Council is holding this meeting to formulate new tasks for the struggle to achieve a higher stage of easing international tensions and lasting peace.

    Peace cannot be defended through passive wishes, but through the active struggle of hundreds of millions of working people around the world against imperialism. A peaceful solution to all international problems will always be in the interests of the working class, working people, and all progressive mankind.

    Loga-Sowinski believes that a peaceful solution to international problems is the basis of the World Federation of Trade Unions' general line of striving for the easing of international tensions and peace among nations, and for complete and thorough disarmament.

    He believes that "the strength of socialism and the higher stage of development of the consciousness of the people of all countries have formed an international situation that provides a new basis for discussing the issue of arms reduction." "The arms race is the result of the Cold War, and arms reduction should be the result of peaceful coexistence. An increasing number of people in the world recognize that the production and stockpiling of highly destructive modern weapons that can destroy life on Earth in a matter of hours will inevitably lead to the destruction of all mankind's rich achievements."

    He said that the proposals made by Comrade Khrushchev in his letters to the major powers and in the Soviet government's statement of June 2, 1960, opened up new prospects for the realization of a program of complete and thorough disarmament. These proposals have received the full support of the Polish government and all working people of People's Poland.

    He believes that "arms reduction can provide economic and technical assistance to underdeveloped countries while respecting the equality and independence of all nations, opening up new prospects for them. In these countries, one can build industrial enterprises and create the foundations that allow them to utilize their own raw material resources." "In addition, arms reduction can enable people to develop various peaceful industries and ensure full employment. With arms reduction, international trade without any discrimination will become an effective way for countries to get closer and will accelerate the economic development of all countries."

    Loga-Sowinski believes that "in the current situation, the forces of aggression can no longer impose the Cold War on the world in the same way as in the previous period. Today, the balance of power has changed, and the level of consciousness of the people of all countries is different today. It is precisely for this reason that imperialists today can no longer pursue their policies of yesterday in Asia, Africa, and, in the long run, also in Latin America and Europe."

    He said that the working masses of Poland are very concerned about defending peace and complete and thorough disarmament because they are concerned about the peaceful construction of socialism. He then introduced some important economic and social problems that Poland needs to solve in the coming years.

    Loga-Sowinski said that the victory of socialism over capitalism in the world-wide peaceful competition is not a propaganda slogan under a certain situation in international politics. This process reflects the normal development of history. He believes that "to interpret this issue in another way would be to deny this normal development and would only be the result of underestimating the forces of peace, the forces of socialism, and underestimating the fact that the East wind is prevailing over the West wind."

    He said that none of us should therefore ignore the threat to peace caused by the objective laws of imperialism and the conscious activities of imperialist aggressive blocs. The laws that determine the actions of the imperialist system and that breed war have not ceased to function and have not ceased to push towards war.

    We are very clear that imperialism and the imperialist bourgeoisie have not become better, but they are no longer so powerful as to do whatever they want. We all agree with the fact that the essence of imperialism itself does not bring independence to the people of all countries, just as it has never brought peace and peaceful coexistence. Imperialism must be forced to achieve peace.

    He said that the significance of our struggle for the realization of unified trade union action on a world scale lies precisely in relying on the growing strength of the socialist camp countries, in mobilizing the masses, and in the tremendous pressure generated by the growing influence of the national liberation movements in semi-colonial and dependent countries, that people can and should force imperialism to agree to maintain peace.

    It is impossible to expose and isolate the aggressive forces of the Cold War and the imperialist aggressive blocs if we do not fight for the united action of the working class ranks, if we do not attract workers, the masses of the people, and all peaceful and progressive forces into a united front, and it is impossible to achieve the united action of the working class without condemning and isolating the imperialist aggressive blocs, it is impossible to attract the broad masses of the people, all peaceful and progressive forces in the world, into this united front. These two aspects are closely related.

    He said that at the appropriate time, firm action must be taken to strongly warn the imperialist aggressive forces to behave themselves. We are very clear that as long as imperialism exists, the danger of war exists.

    Loga-Sowinski said, "In our struggle to achieve unified action, we are willing to reach understanding and hold meetings with different national trade unions, and even the World Federation of Trade Unions and the 'International Confederation of Free Trade Unions' are willing to hold talks. But talks alone are not enough. We hope to achieve real progress, not superficial progress, on this historically significant path. We strive to consolidate the forces of peace, develop unified trends, and achieve unified action in the trade union movement."

    Loga-Sowinski said that the program formulated by this meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council is correct, and the Polish delegation fully supports it. The Polish trade unions will follow the policy of unified action to implement the action program formulated by the Eleventh Council meeting; they will contribute to the struggle for peace among the people of countries living under two different social systems.

    He believes that "the proposition of peaceful coexistence, the transition from the arms race to striving to improve the living standards between the socialist world system and the capitalist world system, this is our socialist proposition put forward by Lenin and realized by the Soviet Union for decades, this is the policy implemented by all countries in the socialist camp, which was developed by the 20th and 21st Congresses of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union under the current conditions."

    He sends the best wishes to the great Chinese people who are transitioning to a great socialist power. He said that the Polish People's Republic and the People's Republic of China are linked together by common goals. Together with the first and most powerful socialist country—the Soviet Union, with the People's Republic of China, with all countries building socialism, we have formed a powerful, close-knit socialist camp, which is the hope and inspiration for the people of all countries in the struggle for peace and progress.

    Loga-Sowinski concluded by saying, Long live the World Federation of Trade Unions, fighting against imperialism and colonialism, for the independence of all countries, for the unity of workers and trade union rights, for the defense of peace, and for the realization of complete and thorough disarmament throughout the world.

    波兰工会中央理事会主席
    洛加—索文斯基的发言
    新华社9日讯　世界工联副主席、波兰工会中央理事会主席洛加—索文斯基8日上午在世界工联理事会会议上发言。
    洛加—索文斯基首先说，波兰的劳动者像全世界劳动群众一样，对美帝国主义集团阻挠最高级会议举行的行为，表达了自己的愤慨并且加以谴责。波兰工会和人民群众支持对冷战势力的回击。波兰的工会和人民群众支持赫鲁晓夫同志所采取的立场，这种立场是唯一正确的立场，它为争取国际局势缓和，为使国际关系中不再出现任何挑衅或侵略行为而进行的斗争，走上新的阶段开辟道路。
    他说，我们世界工联理事会举行这次会议，是为争取缓和国际局势和持久和平的更高阶段的斗争制定新的任务。
    不可能通过消极的愿望来保卫和平，而是要通过全世界千百万劳动人民反对帝国主义的积极斗争来保卫和平。和平解决一切国际问题，将始终对工人阶级、劳动者和整个进步人类有利。
    洛加—索文斯基认为，和平解决国际问题，是世界工联争取缓和国际紧张局势和各国人民之间的和平、争取彻底和全面裁军的总路线的基础。
    他认为，“社会主义的力量和各国人民觉悟达到更高的发展阶段，形成这样的一种国际形势，从而为讨论裁减军备问题提供了新的基础。”“军备竞赛是冷战的结果，裁减军备则应该是和平共处的结果。世界上日益众多的人认识到，生产和储存能够在几小时之内消灭地球上的生命的毁灭性很大的现代武器，不可避免地将导致人类一切丰富成就的毁灭。”
    他说，赫鲁晓夫同志在致各大国的信件中和苏联政府1960年6月2日的声明中所提出的建议，为实现彻底和全面裁军纲领开辟了新的前景。这些建议得到了波兰政府和人民波兰全体劳动者的完全支持。
    他认为，“裁减军备，可以在尊重各国人民的平等与独立的情况下，向不发达国家提供经济和技术援助，将为他们开辟新的前景。人们可以在这些国家中兴建工业企业，创建使它们可以利用自己的原料资源的基础。”“此外，裁减军备还可以使人们发展各种和平工业和保证完全就业。随着裁减军备，没有任何歧视的国际贸易，将成为各国人民接近的有效办法，并将加速各国的经济发展。”
    洛加—索文斯基认为，“在目前形势下，侵略势力已经不能用前一时期的方式把冷战强加于全世界。今天，力量对比已发生了变化，各国人民的觉悟水平今天也不同了。正是因为这个缘故，帝国主义者今天已经不能再在亚洲、非洲，从长远看来也不能再在拉丁美洲和欧洲奉行他们昨日的政策。”
    他说，波兰的劳动群众十分关心保卫和平和彻底全面裁减军备，因为他们关心社会主义的和平建设。他接着介绍了波兰在今后几年中需要解决的一些重要的经济和社会问题。
    洛加—索文斯基说，社会主义在世界规模上同资本主义进行和平竞赛中的胜利，不是一句在国际政治某一种形势下的宣传口号。这个过程反映了历史的正常发展。他认为，“以另外一种方式来阐述这一问题，将是否认这种正常发展，将只是由于低估和平力量、社会主义力量，低估东风压倒西风这一事实的结果。”
    他说，我们当中不论何人并不因而忽视由于帝国主义的客观规律和帝国主义侵略集团有意识的活动而造成的对和平的威胁。决定帝国主义体系的行动和孕育战争的规律，并没有停止起作用而且也没有停止推向战争。
    我们十分清楚，帝国主义和帝国主义资产阶级没有变好，但已经不再是那么强大而能为所欲为。我们都同意这一事实，即：帝国主义的本质本身并不带来各国人民的独立，正如它从来没有带来和平和和平共处一样。必须迫使帝国主义实现和平。
    他说，我们为争取实现世界规模的工会统一行动而进行的斗争的意义，恰好在于依靠社会主义阵营各国日益增长的力量、在于动员群众和由于半殖民地和附属国民族解放运动日益增长的影响而产生的巨大压力，人们能够而且应该迫使帝国主义不得不同意维护和平。
    如果不为工人阶级队伍的统一行动而斗争，如果不把工人、人民群众和一切和平和进步力量吸引到统一阵线中来，就不可能揭露和孤立冷战的侵略势力和帝国主义侵略集团，如果不谴责和孤立帝国主义侵略集团，就不可能达到工人阶级的统一行动，就不可能把广大的人民群众、全世界一切和平和进步力量吸引到这一统一阵线中来。这两方面是紧密相联的。
    他说，在适当的时候，必须坚决地采取行动，有力地正告帝国主义侵略势力放老实一些。我们非常清楚地知道，只要帝国主义存在，战争的危险就存在。
    洛加—索文斯基说，“在我们争取统一行动的斗争中，我们愿意同不同的全国性工会取得谅解和进行会晤，甚至愿意世界工联和‘国际自由工联’举行会谈。但是仅仅会谈是不够的。我们希望在这一具有历史意义的道路上取得真正的进展，而不是表面的进展。我们力求巩固和平力量，发展统一的趋向和在工会运动中实现统一行动。”
    洛加—索文斯基说，世界工联理事会这次会议所制定的纲领是正确的，波兰代表团完全支持。波兰工会将遵循统一行动的政策，来实现理事会第十一次会议制定的行动纲领；他们将为生活在两个不同的社会制度中的各国人民之间的和平而进行的斗争作出贡献。
    他认为，“和平共处的主张，在社会主义世界体系和资本主义世界体系之间从进行军备竞赛过渡到争取提高生活水平，这就是列宁提出的、苏联几十年来实现了的我们的社会主义主张，这是苏联共产党第二十次和第二十一次代表大会在目前条件下发展了的、社会主义阵营所有国家实行的政策。”
    他向正在过渡到一个伟大的社会主义强国的伟大的中国人民致最好的祝愿。他说，波兰人民共和国和中华人民共和国是由共同的目的联结在一起的。我们同第一个最强大的社会主义国家——苏联、同中华人民共和国、同所有建设社会主义的国家一起，形成了强大的亲密无间的社会主义阵营，它是各国人民在争取和平和进步的斗争中的希望和鼓舞力量。
    洛加—索文斯基最后说，为反对帝国主义和殖民主义、为争取各国人民的独立、为争取工人的团结和工会权利、为保卫和平和争取在全世界实现全面彻底裁军而斗争的世界工联万岁。
