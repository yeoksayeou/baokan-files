    Exploiting Equipment Potential to Increase Power Supply
    Suzhou Comprehensively Adjusts Electric Motors
    (Our newspaper, Nanjing, June 24th) Suzhou City’s factories and mines have broken down the boundaries between factories and industries, adopting methods of matching, combining, adjusting, and modifying to comprehensively and rationally adjust electric motors. After unified adjustment throughout the city, a total of nearly two thousand kilowatts of electric motors and corresponding power have been discovered. Suzhou City's approach provides a new method for solving the shortage of electric motors and conserving electricity.
    Suzhou City's rational adjustment of electric motors includes: First, matching, which means using small motors to replace larger ones within a factory or between factories, freeing up excess electric motors. Second, combining, which means adopting the method of combining machines within units to fully utilize large-capacity, lightly-loaded electric motors. Third, adjusting, which means organizing unified adjustment within enterprises and between industries based on matching and combining. Fourth, modifying, which means freeing up electric motors by improving equipment, or reforming the structure of electric motors to increase output. As a result, a large number of power equipment has been discovered.

    挖掘设备潜力　增加电力供应
    苏州全面调整电动机
    本报南京24日电　苏州市各厂矿企业打破厂与厂、行业与行业之间的界限，采取套、并、调、改的办法，全面合理调整电动机。全市经过统一调整，共挖掘出近两千瓩的电动机和相应的电力。苏州市的这种做法，为解决电动机不足、节约电力提供了一项新的办法。
    苏州市合理调整电动机的做法：一是套，就是厂内或厂与厂之间，以小套大，套出多余的电动机。二是并，就是在单位内部采取并机台的办法，使大容量轻负荷的电动机得到充分利用。三是调，就是在套和并的基础上，组织企业内部行业与行业之间统一调整。四是改，就是通过改进设备，腾出电动机，或者改革电动机结构，提高出力。这样做的结果，挖掘出了大批的电力设备。
