Xinhua News Agency, June 20th. Famous returned overseas Chinese in Beijing gathered today to angrily protest Eisenhower's heinous activities in plotting war on our country's territory of Taiwan. They resolutely stated that overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese compatriots will, together with the people of the whole country, thoroughly smash the US imperialist plot to create "two Chinas" and resolutely fight to the end for the liberation of Taiwan.

Responsible persons from the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese compatriots from Indonesia, Japan, Malaya, Singapore, Mexico, Vietnam and other places spoke enthusiastically at the meeting. You Yangzu, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said that the awareness of the people of Asian countries has increased, and the "plague god" Eisenhower is opposed by the people wherever he goes. Our army on the Fujian front fired cannons to "welcome and send off," expressing the contempt and disdain of the Chinese people for US imperialism and the war "plague god" Eisenhower.

Wang Yuanxing, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said that we overseas Chinese, like the people of the whole country, are extremely indignant at Eisenhower's robber trip to the Far East and his war provocations on our country's territory of Taiwan. The head of US imperialism is now in such a sorry state, and as the days of imperialism rot away day by day, we must remind those reactionary groups who collude with US imperialism that there is no future in being lackeys of US imperialism, following others' lead.

Zhuang Mingli, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said that the evil wolf Eisenhower ran to our sacred territory of Taiwan to set fires. His plot to create "two Chinas" has been exposed by us, and the paper tiger's true form has been revealed. It is of great significance that we use cannons to "welcome and send off" this plague god. Eisenhower is the head of US imperialism, and such people must be severely beaten and violently bombarded. It is not acceptable not to beat them or bombard them.

Chen Qiyuan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said in a written statement that US imperialism is a paper tiger, and Eisenhower is a "plague god." This "plague god's" conspiratorial activities in the Far East have been repeatedly defeated, and he has made an ugly spectacle of himself in front of the people of the world. The life of imperialism is not long, and the "plague god" will be consumed by his own evil deeds. Our army's cannon fire to drive away the "plague god" on the Fujian front is truly gratifying. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we, the people of the whole country, will unite with the people of the world and will surely be able to completely smash all the conspiratorial activities of US imperialism.

Zhuang Xiquan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said that Eisenhower is a genuine "plague god." His robber trip to the Far East this time has suffered a disastrous defeat.

Wang Yuting, Secretary-General of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said that Eisenhower is the number one war-monger. Our people's use of cannons to bombard him has strongly supported the struggle of the people of the Far East and the world against US imperialism.

Zhang Chukun, Deputy Secretary-General of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said that overseas Chinese are distributed in Southeast Asian countries, and overseas Chinese and the people of Southeast Asian countries have learned from their own experience that US imperialism is the common enemy of the Asian people. Only by waging a resolute struggle against US imperialism can we avoid enslavement, poverty, disaster, and death. Overseas Chinese cheered for the cannon fire in the Taiwan Strait: Well done!

Wu Yixiu, Standing Committee Member of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and Vice Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said that US imperialism has carried out a series of aggressive activities in Asia: occupying our country's territory of Taiwan, creating the "two Chinas" plot, and attempting to revive Japanese militarism. All of this has been resolutely opposed by the Chinese people and the Asian people. Wu Yixiu stated that in order to defend the motherland and liberate our territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu, we overseas Chinese are prepared to contribute all our strength.

Huang Dingchen, Standing Committee Member of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said that our army on the Fujian front used cannons to "welcome and send off" the head of US imperialism, Eisenhower, which greatly supported the struggle of the people of Japan, Korea, and the Philippines against US imperialism. Eisenhower came to the Far East to shore up and encourage his lackeys, but the result was the opposite.

Also speaking at the meeting were responsible persons from the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese from various countries in Beijing, including Huang Changshui, Liu Jinhan, Wei Zhengming, Cai Zhongchang, Li Mei, Yan Naiqing, Zhou Xiqing, Weng Huihao, Guan Jianfang, Hong Jinshan, Qiu Weicai, Huang Wenzhe, Zhang Guoji, Cai Zhongsi, and Zhu Hanjie.

    在京归侨著名人士集会谴责艾森豪威尔强盗旅行
    侨胞决为解放台湾斗争到底
    新华社20日讯　在京的归国华侨著名人士今天集会，愤怒抗议艾森豪威尔到我国领土台湾策划战争的罪恶活动。他们坚决表示：海外华侨和归国侨胞将同全国人民一道，彻底粉碎美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋，为解放台湾而坚决斗争到底。
    全国侨联负责人和来自印度尼西亚、日本、马来亚、新加坡、墨西哥、越南等地的归国侨胞在会上踊跃发言。全国侨联副主席尤扬祖说，亚洲各国人民的觉悟提高了，“瘟神”艾森豪威尔每到一地，就受到人民的反对。福建前线我军开炮“迎送”，表示了我国人民对美帝国主义和战争“瘟神”艾森豪威尔的蔑视和鄙视。
    全国侨联副主席王源兴说，我们国外华侨同全国人民一样，对艾森豪威尔的远东强盗旅行，并到我国领土台湾进行战争挑衅，表示极为愤慨。美帝国主义头子现在这样狼狈，帝国主义的日子一天天烂下去的时候，我们要提醒那些勾结美帝国主义的反动集团，当美帝国主义的走狗，随人俯仰，是没有前途的。
    全国侨联副主席庄明理说，恶狼艾森豪威尔跑到我国神圣的领土台湾是来放火的，他妄图制造“两个中国”的阴谋，已经被我们拆穿了，纸老虎的原形毕露。我们用大炮“迎送”这个瘟神，意义很大。艾森豪威尔是一个美帝国主义的头子，对这种人就要狠狠地打，猛烈地轰，不打、不轰是不行的。
    全国侨联副主席陈其瑗在书面发言中说，美帝国主义是纸老虎，艾森豪威尔是“瘟神”。这个“瘟神”在远东的阴谋活动节节失败，在全世界人民的面前丑态百出。帝国主义的寿命不长了，“瘟神”作恶多端必自焚。我军在福建前线炮逐“瘟神”真是大快人心。我们全国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，同全世界人民团结起来，一定能够彻底粉碎美帝国主义的一切阴谋活动。
    全国侨联副主席庄希泉说，艾森豪威尔是货真价实的“瘟神”。他这次到远东的强盗旅行，已遭到惨败。
    全国侨联秘书长王雨亭说，艾森豪威尔是天字第一号的战争贩子，我国人民用大炮轰他，有力的支持了远东和全世界人民的反对美帝国主义的斗争。
    侨联副秘书长张楚琨说，华侨分布在东南亚各国，华侨同东南亚各国人民从切身经验中认识到：美帝国主义是亚洲人民的共同敌人。只有同美帝国主义进行坚决的斗争，才能免于奴役、贫困、灾难和死亡。国外华侨为台湾海峡的炮声而欢呼：打得好。
    全国侨联常务委员、北京市侨联副主席吴益修说，美帝国主义在亚洲进行了一系列的侵略活动：霸占我国领土台湾，制造“两个中国”的阴谋，妄图复活日本军国主义，这一切都遭到了中国人民和亚洲人民的坚决反对。吴益修表示：为了保卫祖国，解放我国领土台、澎、金、马，我们华侨准备贡献我们的全部力量。
    全国侨联常委黄鼎臣说，福建前线我军用大炮“迎送”美帝国主义的头子艾森豪威尔，这大大支持了日本、朝鲜、菲律宾人民的反对美帝国主义的斗争。艾森豪威尔到远东来活动，想给他的走狗撑腰、打气，结果适得其反。
    在会上讲话的还有全国侨联的负责人和在北京的各国归侨黄长水、刘锦汉、魏正明、蔡钟长、李梅、颜乃卿、周锡卿、翁会好、关简芳、洪进山、丘卫才、黄文哲、张国基、蔡钟泗、朱汉杰等人。（附图片）
