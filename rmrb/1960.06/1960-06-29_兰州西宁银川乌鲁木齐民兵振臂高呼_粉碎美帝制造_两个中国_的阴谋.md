    Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, June 28th: Twenty-five thousand militiamen in Lanzhou City, Gansu Province, held an anti-U.S. demonstration rally on the 27th, strongly opposing U.S. imperialism's occupation of our country's territory of Taiwan, and firmly stating that they must liberate Taiwan and defend world peace.
    Liang Yimin, Secretary of the Lanzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, spoke first at the meeting. He solemnly pointed out that if U.S. imperialism insists on obstructing and undermining our liberation of Taiwan, we will resolutely strike the aggressors.
    Xu Guozhen, the head of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Lanzhou, called on all militiamen in his speech to be a hundred times more vigilant against the conspiracies and tricks of imperialism, to be ready at any time to smash all preparations for a war of aggression, to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instruction on "arming the whole people," and to strive to realize the "Ten Proposals" of the National Militia Representative Conference. If U.S. imperialism dares to launch a war of aggression, we will let it be trapped in the vast ocean of our country's armed forces.
    After the meeting, 25,000 militiamen held a large-scale anti-U.S. demonstration.

The Chinese people must liberate our country's territory of Taiwan and never let U.S. imperialism's plot to create "two Chinas" succeed.

  “Resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism's aggression against our country's territory of Taiwan!” “We must liberate Taiwan!” Angry slogans rose one after another, resounding over the "ancient city of the frontier."
    Feng Mao, Political Commissar of the Yinchuan City Militia, spoke at the demonstration rally. He said: The inherently aggressive U.S. imperialism cannot change its nature. We must be a hundred times more vigilant against U.S. imperialism and resolutely fight it to the end.

Let the American aggressors be drowned in the vast ocean of the whole people being soldiers. Wang Weiguo, a peasant militia representative who attended the National Militia Representative Conference, said that he would actively train the militia, learn military skills well, and be ready at any time to respond to the call of the motherland and give the American aggressors a head-on blow.
