Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd, Washington dispatch: U.S. Secretary of State Herter admitted during testimony before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on the 21st that Eisenhower being forced to cancel his visit to Japan was "a very unfortunate thing." He also admitted that the U.S. government "did" "misjudge" the situation in Japan. He said the U.S. government originally expected the situation in Japan to "calm down," but "this did not happen."

A large part of Herter's statement was in response to accusations from Senate Democratic leader Johnson. Johnson expressed his unease about the anti-American struggle of the Japanese people and worried that U.S. military bases in Japan would be "endangered" as a result. Johnson also attacked the U.S. government's foreign policy. He said that although the United States has spent hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign countries, it has still suffered a "major failure." He believes that the development of major events in the past month has been "discouraging" for the United States. The breakdown of the four-nation summit, the development of the situation in Japan, etc. have "caused worries in the United States that have not appeared for many years," and "the borders of the free world are more chaotic than ever before."

In his response, Herter tried to calm people's hearts. He stubbornly said that he disagreed with "the assessment of a major failure of (U.S.) policy" and emphasized that the U.S. policy of aggression remains unchanged. He clamored that "today's international atmosphere emphasizes the need to maintain unity and strengthen the strength of our allies." What is needed now is not "a major change in the direction of our diplomatic efforts," but "what is needed is to maintain and strengthen its quality and continuity."

In his testimony, Herter also urged the Senate to quickly approve the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" which creates tension in the Far East and prepares for wars of aggression.

    赫脱供认对日本局势“判断错误”
    民主党议员攻讦政府花费大量美元仍不免外交政策“大失败”
    新华社22日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿赫脱21日在参议院拨款小组委员会作证时承认，艾森豪威尔被迫取消对日本的访问是“一件非常不幸的事”。他并且承认，美国政府对日本的局势“确实是”“判断错误了”。他说，美国政府原来预料日本局势会“平静下去”，但是“这都没有发生”。
    赫脱的发言很大一部分是回答参议院民主党领袖约翰逊的指责。约翰逊对日本人民的反美斗争表示很不安，担心美国在日本的军事基地将因此而“受到危害”。约翰逊同时还攻击美国政府的外交政策。他说，尽管美国向外国花了数以亿计的美元，但还是遭到了“大失败”。他认为，一个月来重大事件的发展对美国说来是“令人丧气”的。四国政府首脑会议破裂的事件，日本局势的发展等等在美国“已经引起了许多年来都没有出现过的忧虑”，“自由世界的边界比以前任何时候都要混乱”。
    赫脱在回答时力图稳定人心，他顽固地说，他不同意“关于（美国）政策遭到重大失败的估价”，并且强调美国的侵略政策仍坚持不变。他叫嚷说，“今天的国际气氛强调说明了保持团结和加强我们的盟国的力量的必要性”，目前需要的不是“大大改变我们外交努力的方针”，“所需要的是维持和加强它的质量和持续性。”
    赫脱在作证中还要求参议院迅速批准在远东制造紧张局势和准备侵略战争的美日新“安全条约”。
