    Beautiful Evening
    Xu Kang
    Old Wu and I finished work at the factory, had dinner, and went for a walk to Guan'erya Village, not far from our factory.

    Guan'erya is south of the Longhai Railway, a typical small village surrounded by a sea of wheat. Tall poplars and weeping willows swayed gently in the evening breeze around the village. The walls of every house in the village were whitewashed, and the afterglow of the setting sun shone on them, making the small village look very quiet and beautiful.

    We entered the village and felt that it was much more beautiful than before. Not a speck of dust could be found in any corner of the village, as if it had been washed with water. "Look, what a beautiful village!" Old Wu said to me, "This is the rural area after collectivization."

    There was a large, mirror-smooth square in the center of the village. Several white-haired old ladies sat on small stools in the center of the square, chatting and laughing, not knowing what they were talking about. Along the edge of the square, a row of pigsties had been built, from which came a chorus of squealing piglets.

    At the head of the village, there were three children, five or six years old, collecting fine sand on the ground and then piling it up to build an earth dragon. A smaller child said excitedly, "Even the biggest flood can't wash away our flood barrier." It turned out that the children were also setting lofty goals and aspiring to conquer nature.

    At the end of the road, a burst of singing wafted over. In the beautiful and intoxicating sunset, a group of women returning from work carried hoes on their shoulders. They sang and joked as they walked.

    "Hey! Honghua, don't run, you'll fall. Mom will be back soon." I turned my head and saw a child of about three or four years old running on small steps towards the group of women. Behind her, a woman in a white coat was chasing after her, it was the nanny from the nursery. She ran and called to the child.

    Sure enough, a young woman ran out from the group of women in front, shouting, "Honghua, Mom is here, don't run."

    Ah! What a beautiful picture! It's a pity I'm not a painter, I can't depict it.

    Old Wu and I continued to walk forward. We heard the familiar singing of a motor in front of us. It turned out that the commune's cotton ginning factory and flour mill were still busy!

    At this time, the village rang the "dong—dong—dong" bell. The resounding bell echoed in the fields, telling people that the commune canteen was serving food.

    We walked a little further and suddenly heard a "?, ?" sound in the endless wheat field, but we couldn't see anything in the field, which we found strange. We listened carefully, and there was still a "?, ?" sound. I stood on tiptoe and saw a few wriggling heads in the middle of the wheat field, and occasionally a machine spreading 666 pesticide powder was visible. Then I understood. Just then, I heard voices inside, "Xiao Hong, you go back to eat first, the bell has already rung." The voice was sharp and crisp, it was the voice of a young girl.

      "No! You should go back first, you've been spraying dozens of acres and haven't rested yet." This was also a girl's voice.

    We watched here for a long time, but we didn't see anyone come out, and the "?, ?" sound was still ringing inside.

    At this time, the sun had hidden behind the mountains, but the gorgeous sunset was still shaking its colorful clothes on the top of the western mountains. The gentle evening breeze stirred the waves of the wheat sea... I looked at the natural scenery before the harvest and thought to myself, "Our country will soon be built into a beautiful paradise."

    美丽的傍晚
    徐康
    我和老吴在工厂里下了班，吃过晚饭，到离我们工厂不远的关儿崖村去散步。
    关儿崖在陇海路的南边，是个麦海环抱的不太大的普通农村，村的周围有着高高的白杨和倒垂的杨柳，随着晚风轻轻地飘动。村子的每家人家的墙壁上都刷上白石灰，夕阳的余辉照在上面，使这个小村子显得十分幽静而美丽。
    我们进入村子，感到这村子比从前漂亮多了。在村子里无论哪个墙角，都找不到一丝尘灰，仿佛水洗过似的。“你看，多漂亮的村子！”老吴对我说，“这就是公社化的农村”。
    村中有一块平整如镜似的大广场，场中央的小凳上，坐着几位白发苍苍的老太太，她们在嘻笑地谈论着，不知在说些什么。在广场的边沿上，又筑起一排猪圈，从里面传出来吱吱哇哇的一片猪娃子的叫声。
    在村头上，有三个五六岁的孩子，在地上搜集着细砂，然后又把它堆起来，筑成一条土龙。有个较小的孩子兴奋地说：“哪怕天大的洪水，也冲不倒我们这个拦洪坝了。”原来孩子们也在树雄心立大志征服大自然呢。
    路的尽头，飘来了一阵歌声，在美丽的醉人的晚霞下，有一群收工的妇女扛着锄头回来了。她们一边唱着歌，一边嬉闹着。
    “喂！红花不要跑，要摔跤的，妈妈就要回来了。”我掉头看到一个大约三四岁的小孩，踏着小步子，向那群妇女跟前跑去。后面有一位穿着白罩衣的妇女追着，那是托儿所里的阿姨。她在一面跑，一面向小孩叫唤着。
    果然，从前面的妇女群里，奔来了一位青年妇女，喊着：“红花，妈妈来了，不要跑。”
    呵！这是多么美丽的一幅图画呀！可惜我不是画家，不能把它描绘下来。
    我和老吴继续往前走，前面有我们挺熟悉的马达歌唱声，原来公社的轧棉厂和磨粉厂还正在忙着呢！
    这时村子里敲起了“当——当——当”的钟声，这响彻云霄的钟声，在田野里回荡，它在告诉人们：公社食堂开饭了。
  我们又朝前走了一段路，突然听到在一望无际的麦田里，有“?，?”的声音，但又看不到田里有任何东西，感到奇怪。侧耳听听，仍有“?，?”的声响，我踮起脚看，这才见到麦田的中央有几个蠕动的人头，偶然露出一部撒六六六药粉的机器，我这才明白了。就在这时，听到里面的说话声，“小红，你先回去吃饭吧，钟已敲过了。”这声音尖而脆，是一个年青的姑娘的声音。
      “不！还是你先回去，你撒了几十亩还没休息呢。”这也是个姑娘的声音。
    我们在这里看了好一会，可谁也没看到出来，里面仍响着“?，?”的响声。
    这时太阳已躲到山后面去了，但绚烂的晚霞，仍在西山头上抖动着它的彩衣。柔和的晚风掀动着麦海的波浪……我望着丰收前的自然景色，心里想着：“我们的国家，很快就能建成一个美丽的天堂。”
