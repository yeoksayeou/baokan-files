    Peat is Good Feed
    In the great development of animal husbandry, many regions have opened up sources of feed, and peat is one of the new feeds. Xin Dian Commune in Bin County, Heilongjiang Province, has already used a large amount of peat to feed pigs. Feeding results have proven that pigs fed with peat gain the same weight as pigs fed with ordinary feed.
    Peat can be used as feed because it contains a certain amount of nutrients. According to tests, peat generally contains 7.8% crude protein, 0.9% crude fat, 21.24% crude fiber, and more than 30% nitrogen-free extract.
    To feed pigs with peat, first dry and crush the peat, then mix it with 50% clear water for fermentation (keeping the temperature at 2-30 degrees Celsius, sealed tightly for six to seven days). The feeding amount is generally two to three tenths of the prepared peat added to the original feed.
    In some areas of Heilongjiang Province, when using peat as feed, they first use potatoes to cultivate yeast, and then add five catties of yeast and fifty catties of warm water to every hundred catties of dry peat for mixing and fermentation.

    草炭是好饲料
    在畜牧业大发展中，不少地区开辟了饲料来源，草炭就是新饲料的一种。黑龙江省宾县新甸公社已经大量使用草炭喂猪。饲用的结果证明，加喂草炭的猪，比喂一般饲料的猪增重相同。
    草炭能充饲料是因为他含有一定数量的营养物质。据化验，草炭一般含粗蛋白质百分之七点八，粗脂肪百分之零点九，粗纤维百分之二十一点二四，无氮侵出物百分之三十多。
    用草炭喂猪，先把草炭晒干粉碎，然后拌入百分之五十清水发酵（温度保持摄氏二至三十度，严封六、七天）。饲喂数量一般是在原饲料中加制好的草炭二、三成。
    黑龙江省一些地区在利用草炭作饲料中还采用了先用马铃薯培养酵母，然后每百斤干草炭加入五斤酵母和五十斤温水拌搅发酵。
