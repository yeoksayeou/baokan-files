Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd dispatch from New York: While lamenting the disastrous failure of Eisenhower's Far East trip, American bourgeois newspapers are openly encouraging the reactionary Japanese government to further suppress the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people.

    The *New York Times* wrote in an editorial on the 21st with concern: "The situation in Japan in recent weeks clearly shows... Japan's pivotal position as a stronghold in the free world's defense structure is currently at a critical juncture." The newspaper stated, "Under these circumstances, the ultimate fate of the security treaty and our bases in Japan must depend on the outcome of the seemingly inevitable (Japanese) new elections." It worriedly said, "Left-wing riots, which seem likely to occur," and "It is almost worthless to establish bases in a hostile country."

    The *New York Times* blamed "the Japanese government for not having been strong enough to effectively deal with the agitators before the unrest began." It wants the Japanese government to "effectively" suppress the patriotic and just actions of the Japanese people against the United States and its running dogs. The *New York Times* even openly suggested that Japanese right-wing groups emulate Hitler's example, saying that if the current situation in Japan "does not change, one result seems inevitable... The right-wing, which has already taken the stage, will unite to organize right-wing 'stormtroopers'. Japanese democracy may be crushed between the forces of communism and fascism, just as democracy was crushed in Weimar Germany."

    The American magazine *Time* admitted on the 21st that "Japan, which was previously considered a pro-Western fortress, is now questionable."

    The recently published American magazine *Newsweek* wrote in a commentary: Today, the danger for the United States lies in the fact that other Asian countries will react to America's setbacks in a way that is extremely unfavorable to the United States. "America's staunch allies in Europe are asking the question: After the U-2 aircraft incident and the Tokyo incident, can we follow America's leadership?"

    害怕日本人民觉醒哀叹美国政策失败
    美报要日本政府加紧镇压活动
    并示意日本右翼集团效法希特勒
    据新华社22日讯　纽约消息：美国资产阶级报刊在悲叹艾森豪威尔远东之行的惨败的同时，公然鼓励日本反动政府进一步镇压日本人民的爱国正义斗争。
      “纽约时报”21日在社论中忧心忡忡地写道：“最近几周的日本局势清楚地表明……日本作为自由世界防务结构中的举足轻重的堡垒地位目前处在紧要关头”。这家报纸说，“在这种情况下，安全条约和我们驻日基地的最终命运必须取决于：看来不可避免的（日本）新选举”的结果。它担心地说，“左翼的骚乱，看来大概还会发生”，“在一个敌对的国家里设立基地几乎毫无价值”。
      “纽约时报”责怪“日本政府迄今一直没有力量在骚动开始以前就有效地对付骚动者”。它要日本政府“有效地”镇压日本人民反对美国及其走狗的爱国正义行动。“纽约时报”甚至公开示意日本右翼集团效法希特勒的榜样，它说，如果日本目前情况“不改变的话，一个结果看来是不可避免的。……已经走上舞台的右翼将团结组织右翼‘突击队’。日本的民主可能在共产主义和法西斯主义两派势力之间被粉碎，正如民主在魏玛德国被粉碎一样。”
    美国“时代”周刊21日承认，“日本在以前一直被认为是亲西方的堡垒，现在却该打个问号了。”
    最近出版的美国“新闻周刊”在一篇评论中写道：今天对美国来说，危险在于其他亚洲国家将以对美国极为不利的方式对美国的挫折作出反应。“美国在欧洲的坚定的盟友提出这样的问题：在发生U—2飞机事件和东京事件之后，能够追随美国的领导吗？”
