    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, June 12th: U.S. President Eisenhower left Washington by plane today to begin his trip to the Far East to plot aggression and war conspiracies.

    During his trip to the Far East, Eisenhower will visit the Philippines, the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea. During his visit, he will also inspect U.S. military bases in Okinawa.

    Accompanying Eisenhower are Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Parsons and a large number of White House officials.

    Before his departure, Eisenhower issued a statement emphasizing his determination to promote the U.S. policy of aggression in the Far East. He said: There have been many warnings based on different considerations that I should not visit the Far East at this time. Ignoring the opposition and condemnation of the Asian people and public opinion, he shamelessly said, "These warnings prompted me to reconsider and re-examine my personal responsibility in the mission of the United States leading the free world. And in this process, I decided not to postpone or cancel my trip to the Far East."

    Eisenhower tried his best to use the words "peace" and "friendship" to cover up the true purpose of his trip, saying that the "supreme goal" of U.S. policy has been and still is "to improve the atmosphere of international understanding." However, he admitted that his trip is most directly related to the U.S. government's efforts to support some of the slave regimes it has fostered in the Far East. In order to disguise his aggressive activities, he emphasized that during the visit, he "can continue to learn more about the current problems and goals of our friends, and continue to promote a better understanding of the United States abroad, which is an urgent responsibility for me as President of the United States under the current circumstances." He also said that the reason he is going to Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and the Philippines is because America's "ties with them are extremely important to the security of the United States and the security of the free world." Eisenhower's trip to the Far East is a direct step taken by the U.S. government to intensify the creation of tense situations and deploy aggressive plans in various parts of the world, especially in the Far East, immediately after the breakdown of the four-nation government summit. Prior to this, at the SEATO Council meeting held in Washington at the end of May and the beginning of June, the U.S. government had just plotted conspiracies to intensify arms expansion and war preparations in the region and interfere in the national democratic movements in the region. The U.S. government has recently taken a series of measures to intensify aggressive activities and military deployments in Asia. For example, the U.S. military has recently frequently conducted provocative military exercises in China's Taiwan region, South Korea, the Philippines, and Thailand; the Senate has begun to accelerate the passage of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, increase troops in Okinawa, and transport armaments and weapons to the Far East to arm its servants. Some American newspapers admit that Eisenhower's trip to the Far East has a strong military flavor. The areas he is visiting are all "advanced bases or rearguard bases" in the aggressive military chain in the Pacific region that the United States is targeting at China and the Soviet Union, and are also the Northeast Asian region where the United States is trying to piece together new military blocs.

### 加紧推行侵略政策　竭力扶植傀儡政权  艾森豪威尔怀着鬼胎来远东  美国报刊承认总统此行有浓厚的军事气味

    加紧推行侵略政策　竭力扶植傀儡政权
    艾森豪威尔怀着鬼胎来远东
    美国报刊承认总统此行有浓厚的军事气味
    新华社12日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔今天乘飞机离开华盛顿，开始他到远东策划侵略和战争阴谋的旅行。
    艾森豪威尔这次远东之行中将访问菲律宾、台湾蒋介石集团、日本和南朝鲜。他在访问期间并将到冲绳视察美国在那里的军事基地。
    随同艾森豪威尔前来的有负责远东事务的助理国务卿帕森斯和白宫的一大批官员。
    艾森豪威尔在动身前发表一个声明，强调他要到远东推行美国的侵略政策的决心。他说：有着许多出自不同考虑的警告，说我不应该在这个时候访问远东。他不顾亚洲人民和舆论的反对和谴责，却厚颜无耻地说，“这些警告促使我重新考虑和重新研究我在美国领导自由世界的使命中的个人责任。而在这个过程中，我决定不推迟或者取消我的远东之行。”
    艾森豪威尔竭力用“和平”和“友谊”的词句来掩盖他此行的真实目的，说什么美国政策的“最高目标”过去是目前仍然是“改善国际谅解的气氛”。不过他承认，他此行同美国政府要设法支持美国在远东扶植的一些奴才政权有着最直接的关系。为了掩饰他的侵略活动，他这样强调说，在访问中，他“可以继续更多地了解我们的朋友当前的问题和目的，继续促进国外对美国有更好的了解，这一点在目前的情况下是我作为美国总统的一个迫切的责任”。他还说，他所以去日本、南朝鲜、台湾和菲律宾，是因为美国同它们的“联系对美国的安全和自由世界的安全都是极为重要的”。艾森豪威尔这次远东之行是美国政府破坏四国政府首脑会议以后，紧接着在世界各地、特别在远东地区加紧制造紧张局势和部署侵略计划的一个直接步骤。在这以前，在5月底和6月初在华盛顿举行的东南亚侵略集团理事会会议上，美国政府刚刚策划了在这个地区加紧扩军备战和干涉这个地区的民族民主运动的阴谋。美国政府最近还接二连三地采取了一系列措施在亚洲加紧侵略活动和军事部署。例如美国三军最近频频在中国的台湾地区、南朝鲜、菲律宾和泰国举行挑衅性军事演习，参议院着手加快通过日美军事同盟条约，增兵冲绳，并把军火武器源源运来远东武装其仆从。美国一些报刊承认，艾森豪威尔这次远东之行具有浓厚的军事气味。他这次访问的地区全都是美国在太平洋地区矛头指向中苏的侵略性军事链锁中的“先进基地或后卫基地”，而且是美国力图在那里拼凑新的军事集团的东北亚地区。
