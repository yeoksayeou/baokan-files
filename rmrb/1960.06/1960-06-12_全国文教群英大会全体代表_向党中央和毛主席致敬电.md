Xinhua News Agency, June 11th: The following is the full text of the congratulatory telegram from the National Conference of Advanced Units and Workers in Socialist Construction in Education and Culture, Health, Sports, and Journalism to the CPC Central Committee and Chairman Mao:

Respected Party Central Committee, Respected Chairman Mao:

We, the entire body of representatives attending the National Conference of Advanced Units and Workers in Socialist Construction in Education and Culture, Health, Sports, and Journalism, have gathered in Beijing, the capital of our great motherland, amidst the current excellent domestic and international situation, to receive the review of the Party and the state. With unparalleled excitement, we extend our most sublime and sincere greetings to our beloved Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao!

Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, all the people of the country, holding high the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, have realized a comprehensive and sustained leap forward in socialist construction. Currently, while there is a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the whole country is vigorously establishing urban people's communes; technological innovation and technological revolution have become a nationwide Marxist-Leninist economic and technological revolution movement in both urban and rural areas; on the cultural and educational front, the state of cultural backwardness caused by the long-term exploitation and oppression of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary rule is being rapidly changed, a contingent of proletarian intellectuals has begun to form and is expanding, and a high tide of ideological remolding centered on studying Marxism-Leninism and the works of Mao Zedong and a cultural revolution centered on eliminating illiteracy and educational revolution has arrived. We deeply realize that all these great achievements have been made under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. We are able to contribute our strength to the cause of socialist construction in our respective jobs and make some achievements, which is also the result of faithfully following the instructions of the Party and the teachings of Chairman Mao.

Under the education and nurturing of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, a cultural and educational work force with proletarian intellectuals as the backbone has begun to form, and bourgeois intellectuals have made great progress after continuous ideological remolding. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies on the cultural and educational front. We deeply realize that only under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and only in our great socialist motherland, can cultural and educational workers receive such cordial care and achieve such rapid progress politically, ideologically, and professionally. We wholeheartedly thank the great Chinese Communist Party, and thank our great leader Chairman Mao!

At this conference, the Party Central Committee instructed us that cultural and educational work should cooperate with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the movement of people's communes in urban and rural areas, and the movement of technological innovation and technological revolution. We must, together with the people of the whole country, push the cultural revolution to a new high tide, greatly promote the cause of socialist construction and strive to build our country into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, modern science and technology and a modern national defense.

The Party Central Committee instructed us that before the establishment of a communist society, the main content of the cultural revolution is the struggle between socialism and capitalism in the ideological field as to who will win. We must fight to thoroughly eliminate the political and ideological influence of the bourgeoisie, greatly enhance the communist ideological awareness and moral character of all the people, popularize and improve national education, and realize the intellectualization of workers and peasants and the laborization of intellectuals.

The Party Central Committee instructed us that the characteristics of the cultural and educational undertakings of New China lie in its opposition to imperialism, its irreconcilable opposition to imperialist "civilization," and in that it is led by the proletariat, not by the bourgeoisie. We must resolutely oppose American imperialism, the most ferocious enemy of the people of all countries in the world, and resolutely oppose the so-called "Western civilization" and the so-called reactionary ideas of "freedom, equality, and fraternity" it spreads. We must completely shatter the great conspiracy of the imperialists to attempt to "peacefully evolve" socialist countries into capitalism. We must, together with the people of the world, isolate American imperialism to the greatest extent, concentrate all our forces to defeat the forces of war and aggression headed by American imperialism, resolutely support the national democratic movements of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and resolutely support the struggle of the people of capitalist countries for democracy, freedom, and socialism.

Modern revisionism is the product of imperialist policy. Modern revisionists, represented by the Yugoslav Tito clique, try their best to confuse the distinction between ourselves and the enemy, spread bourgeois pacifism and bourgeois humanitarianism, weaken the revolutionary will of the people, and attempt to abolish the revolutionary struggle of the proletariat and permanently maintain the reactionary rule of imperialism. We must thoroughly expose the traitorous face of modern revisionists, thoroughly eliminate the ideological toxins they spread, and thoroughly smash all their destructive activities to split the proletariat.

Respected Party Central Committee, Respected Chairman Mao: We will never fail to live up to the expectations of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. In the future, we must redouble our efforts, strengthen unity, connect with the masses, and guard against arrogance and rashness; strive to study Marxism-Leninism and the works of Mao Zedong; carry forward the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, and a down-to-earth working style. We must, with the spirit of continuous revolution, fight to the end to further set

    全国文教群英大会全体代表
    向党中央和毛主席致敬电
    新华社11日讯　全国教育和文化、卫生、体育、新闻方面社会主义建设先进单位和先进工作者代表大会向中共中央和毛主席致敬电，全文如下：敬爱的党中央、敬爱的毛主席：
    我们出席全国教育和文化、卫生、体育、新闻方面社会主义建设先进单位和先进工作者代表大会的全体代表，在当前国内外大好形势下会集在伟大祖国的首都——北京，接受党和国家的检阅。我们以无比兴奋的心情，向我们敬爱的党中央和毛主席致以最崇高最诚挚的敬礼！
    在党中央和毛主席的领导下，全国人民高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，实现了社会主义建设的全面的持续的跃进。目前，在工农业生产大跃进的同时，全国正在大办城市人民公社；技术革新和技术革命，已经成为全民的马克思列宁主义的城乡经济技术革命运动；在文化教育战线上，帝国主义和国民党反动统治长期剥削和压迫所造成的文化落后状态，正在迅速改变，无产阶级知识分子队伍已经开始形成并且正在扩大，以学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛泽东著作为中心的思想改造运动和以扫除文盲、教育革命为中心的文化革命高潮已经到来。我们深深地体会到，所有这一切伟大成就，都是在党中央和毛主席的领导下取得的。我们能够在各自的工作岗位上为社会主义建设事业贡献自己的力量，做出一些成绩，也是忠实地遵从了党的指示和毛主席的教导的结果。
    在党中央和毛主席的教育和培养下，以无产阶级知识分子为骨干的文化教育工作队伍已经开始形成，资产阶级知识分子经过不断的思想改造，已经有了很大进步。这是毛泽东思想和党的方针政策在文化教育战线上的伟大胜利。我们深深地体会到，只有在党中央和毛主席的领导下，只有在我们社会主义的伟大祖国，文化教育工作者才能受到如此亲切的关怀，才能在政治上、思想上和业务上获得如此飞速的进步。我们衷心地感谢伟大的中国共产党，感谢我们的伟大领袖毛主席！
    在这次大会上，党中央指示我们，文化教育工作要配合工农业生产的大跃进，配合城乡的人民公社化运动，配合技术革新和技术革命运动。我们一定要和全国人民一起，把文化革命推向一个新的高潮，大大促进社会主义建设事业，为把我国迅速地建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化和现代国防的社会主义强国而斗争。
    党中央指示我们，在共产主义社会建成以前，文化革命的主要内容是社会主义和资本主义之间在意识形态方面谁胜谁负的斗争。我们一定要为彻底肃清资产阶级的政治影响和思想影响，极大地提高全体人民的共产主义思想觉悟和道德品质，普及和提高全民教育，实现工农群众知识化和知识分子劳动化而斗争。
    党中央指示我们，新中国文化教育事业的特点，就在于它是反对帝国主义的，是同帝国主义的“文明”势不两立的，在于它是由无产阶级领导的，而不是由资产阶级领导的。我们一定要坚决反对美帝国主义这个世界各国人民的最凶恶的敌人，坚决反对它所传播的所谓“西方文明”、所谓“自由、平等、博爱”等反动思想。我们一定要彻底粉碎帝国主义者企图使社会主义国家向资本主义“和平演变”的大阴谋。我们一定要同全世界人民一道，最大限度地孤立美帝国主义，集中一切力量，击败以美帝国主义为首的战争侵略势力，坚决支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的民族民主运动，坚决支持资本主义国家人民争取民主自由和社会主义的斗争。
    现代修正主义是帝国主义政策的产物。以南斯拉夫铁托集团为代表的现代修正主义者，竭力混淆敌我界限，传播资产阶级和平主义和资产阶级人道主义，涣散人民革命斗志，企图取消无产阶级的革命斗争，永远维持帝国主义的反动统治。我们一定要彻底揭穿现代修正主义者的叛徒面目，彻底消除他们所散布的思想毒素，彻底粉碎他们分裂无产阶级的一切破坏活动。
    敬爱的党中央、敬爱的毛主席：我们决不辜负党中央和毛主席的期望，今后要更加鼓足干劲，加强团结，联系群众，戒骄戒躁；努力学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛泽东著作；发扬敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格和踏踏实实的工作作风。我们要以不断革命的精神，为进一步掀起文化革命的新高潮，为加速社会主义建设，为在将来实现我们的最高理想共产主义而斗争到底。
    伟大的正确的光荣的中国共产党万岁！
    我国各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
      全国教育和文化、卫生、体育、新闻方面社会主义建设先进单位和先进工作者代表大会全体代表
                1960年6月11日
