    Historical Records and Witness
    Cai Chusheng
    Crushing the US imperialist policy of aggression and war is the common struggle task of the people of the world and the Chinese people. We must resolutely liberate Taiwan and not allow US imperialism to continue its aggression. The heroic People's Liberation Army first represented the people of the whole country with the best "speech" – ten thousand cannons roared, driving the "plague god" Eisenhower out of Taiwan.
    We must continue to "speak out." Oppose US imperialism's continued occupation of our territory of Taiwan, expose its "false peace, true war preparation; false relaxation, true aggression" sinister face, and encircle this "plague god."
    The "speech" of Chinese film workers is first and foremost our works. In the past ten years, we have used film, this sharp weapon, to wage unremitting struggles against US imperialism. Many good films exposing the aggressive nature of US imperialism and reflecting the people's anti-imperialist struggles are still textbooks for conducting patriotism and internationalism education among the people. From June 21st to 27th, during the grand "Week of Propaganda Against US Imperialist Aggression, Resolutely Liberate Taiwan, and Defend World Peace" held in eight major cities across the country, a batch of newsreels, feature films, and some excellent films from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will be screened successively in the capital, major cities across the country, and vast rural and industrial and mining areas. These films include: "Storm Over Asia," "The Plague God Exposed," "Shangganling," "Wings in the Sky," "Heroic Island," "Oppose Germ Warfare," and the Korean films "How Can We Live Separated," "Young Guerrillas," "Anti-Aircraft Shooting Team," and twenty-seven others. From these works, people can see the heroic Chinese and Korean people standing on the front lines of defending peace, making earth-shattering struggles to combat US imperialist aggression; they can see the brutal, heinous, and bloody crimes of US imperialism; they can also see the heroic Japanese people, waging a magnificent and righteous struggle to oppose the ugly American faithful lackey, the traitor Nobusuke Kishi, and the US imperialists signing the US-Japan military alliance treaty, as well as the rising tide of anger among the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against US imperialist aggression policies. These films truthfully record the heroic struggles of the people of our time against US imperialism, deeply expose the warlike and aggressive ferocious face of US imperialism, and powerfully declare that this paper tiger of US imperialism will inevitably be driven out and overthrown in shame when hundreds of millions of people rise up to fight.
    These films are true historical records and true historical witnesses. Our audiences will gain confidence and strength from these films, and will be more high-spirited and more confident in fighting to the end against US imperialist aggression, resolutely liberating Taiwan, and defending world peace.

    历史的纪录和见证
    蔡楚生
    粉碎美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，是全世界人民和中国人民的共同斗争任务，我们要坚决解放台湾，不许美帝国主义继续侵略。英勇的人民解放军首先代表全国人民作了最好的“发言”——万炮怒发，轰逐“瘟神”艾森豪威尔滚出台湾。
    我们还要继续“发言”。反对美帝国主义继续霸占我国领土台湾，揭露它“假和平、真备战，假缓和、真侵略”的狰狞面目，围剿这个“瘟神”。
    中国电影工作者的“发言”，首先是我们的作品。过去十年里，我们运用电影这个犀利的武器，同美帝国主义进行了不懈的斗争。许多揭露美帝国主义侵略本性、反映人民反帝斗争的好影片，至今还是向人民进行爱国主义和国际主义教育的教科书。从6月21日到27日，全国八大城市举行的规模盛大的“反对美帝侵略、坚决解放台湾、保卫世界和平宣传周”中，首都和全国各大城市以及广大的农村与工矿区，将先后放映一批新闻纪录片、故事片和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的一些优秀影片。这些影片有：“亚洲风暴”“瘟神现原形”“上甘岭”“长空比翼”“英雄岛”“反对细菌战”和朝鲜片“分开怎能活下去”“少年游击队”“对空射击组”等二十七部。从这些作品中，人们可以看到站在保卫和平最前线的英勇的中朝人民，为打击美帝国主义的侵略所做的惊天动地的斗争；可以看到美帝国主义残暴的、令人发指的血腥罪行；也可以看到英勇的日本人民，为反对丑恶的美国忠实走狗、卖国贼岸信介和美帝签订日美军事同盟条约所进行的波澜壮阔的正义斗争，以及亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民掀起的反对美帝国主义侵略政策的怒潮。这些电影真实地纪录了我们这个时代人民反对美帝国主义所进行的英勇斗争，深刻揭露了美帝国主义好战、侵略的凶残面目，有力地宣告了美帝国主义这只纸老虎，在亿万人民奋起斗争时，必然要被轰出去、要被打倒的可耻下场。
    这些电影是历史真实的纪录，也是历史真实的见证。我们的观众将从这些电影中获得信心和力量，更加斗志昂扬、更加信心百倍地为反对美帝侵略、坚决解放台湾和保卫世界和平而斗争到底。
