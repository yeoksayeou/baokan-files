Xinhua News Agency, 7th. World Federation of Trade Unions Executive Committee member and Ceylon Federation of Trade Unions Chairman Mendis spoke at the World Federation of Trade Unions Council meeting on the afternoon of the 6th.

Mendis first pointed out: We are holding the important meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council in this great Asian city - Beijing. This city is where the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference of the World Federation of Trade Unions was held immediately after the great victory of the Chinese revolution eleven years ago. At that historic meeting, attended by Chairman Liu Shaoqi, the World Federation of Trade Unions formulated the general line for trade unions and progressive movements in Asian and Australian countries. This Council meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions will undoubtedly make a far-reaching contribution to the great cause we are engaged in.

He then introduced the trade union activities in Ceylon. He said that in the two and a half years since the Fourth World Trade Union Congress, there has been important progress in the Ceylon trade union movement. Our country's trade unions have formed a tradition of uniting in the struggle against common enemies. In the general election in March this year, the working class played an important role in defeating the reactionary parties and electing a progressive government. Progressive parties won a majority of seats. However, due to the interference of the US and British ambassadors, the Governor-General dissolved Parliament. Another general election will be held next month, and three parties have already formed an election alliance to defeat the reactionary parties. US and British imperialists and foreign capitalists are attempting to defeat the election alliance of progressive parties in the next election and elect their pawns into Parliament. I believe that one of the most important tasks of trade unions today is to study and analyze the influence of US imperialism in every capitalist country, and to launch a movement among workers and other classes of people to expose it.

Mendis said: A few years ago, US imperialism shamelessly made the following demands as conditions for granting Ceylon the "Point Four" aid plan: 1. Restrict trade union rights and suppress progressive movements; 2. Facilitate US investment; 3. Provide convenience for the "Asia Foundation" to carry out activities; 4. Allow the United States to use bases for military purposes. Due to the opposition of the people, we did not accept this aid. Experience has proven that any country that accepts US aid will become a US colony.

He emphasized: Today, the sole purpose of US imperialism is to dominate the world. US imperialism is playing the role of Nazism, but on a larger scale and with more sinister methods. On the eve of the summit conference, the United States sent U-2 aircraft to the Soviet Union for espionage activities, which proves that Eisenhower's "peace talks" are nothing but deception and falsehood.

Mendis pointed out: In order to strengthen peace, we must struggle to free some countries from the control and influence of US imperialism. The most reliable guarantee for lasting peace is to isolate and weaken US imperialism. The struggle of the colonial and oppressed people of all countries is another great contribution to lasting peace.

He said: Today, the oppressed people all over the world are waging a resolute struggle against the oppressors. After describing the heroic struggles of the people of Algeria, Cuba, Iraq, Turkey, and South Korea, Mendis said that the struggles of the people of Latin America, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East prove that the struggle of the colonial and oppressed people of all countries is surging forward vigorously, and no force on earth can stop and defeat this struggle, no matter how cruel and powerful these oppressors may be. He said that the struggle of the Japanese people against the "US-Japan Military Treaty" and to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke group is developing and growing stronger. These struggles will continue to develop, and will continue to develop with greater strength and greater determination. It will continue to strengthen the peace camp. Mendis emphasized that the sacred task of the World Federation of Trade Unions is to strengthen these forces for problem solving, because they are a strong army that will stand on the side of the progressive forces that defend world peace. Socialist countries, especially the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the German Democratic Republic, are giving tremendous fraternal assistance to the oppressed and the oppressed people fighting against colonialism, and are in contact with their representatives. This activity is achieving very good results.

He said: Before I conclude my speech, I want to say a few words to express our attitude towards the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. We must continue to strive for unity at all levels, but we have not exposed the agents of US imperialism within the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" enough. We did criticize, but it was not enough. Let the members of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions understand what kind of people some of their leaders are. Leaders of the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" like George Meany are traitors and running dogs of imperialism. They actively support the war plans of imperialist warmongers and curry favor with monopoly capitalists. They must be mercilessly exposed as the deadly enemies of the working class. If we want to win over the upright elements and masses in the leadership of the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions", we must correctly expose these people. He also pointed out that we must develop friendly contacts and connections with upright trade union workers in the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and its member organizations.

    世界工联执委、锡兰工联主席曼迪斯发言指出
    接受美援将变成美国的殖民地
    孤立和削弱美帝国主义才能保障和平
    新华社7日讯　世界工联执行委员、锡兰工联主席曼迪斯6日下午在世界工联理事会会议上发言。
    曼迪斯首先指出：在这个伟大的亚洲城市——北京，我们正在举行世界工联理事会的重要会议，这个城市是十一年前在中国革命取得伟大的胜利之后，立即举行世界工联亚澳工会会议的地方。在有刘少奇主席出席的那次具有历史意义的会议上，世界工联制订了亚澳国家工会和进步运动的总路线。世界工联的这次理事会会议，无疑将为我们所从事的伟大事业作出具有深远意义的贡献。
    他接着介绍了锡兰的工会活动情况。他说，从第四届世界工会大会以来的二年半期间，锡兰工会运动有了重要进展。我国工会已形成了一种在反对共同敌人的斗争中团结在一起的传统，在今年3月的大选中，工人阶级在击败反动政党和选出进步政府的斗争中起了重要作用。进步的政党得到了大多数席位。但是由于美英大使的干涉，总督解散了国会。下月又将举行大选，现在已有三个政党结成了击败反动政党的选举联盟。美英帝国主义者以及外国资本家企图在下次选举中击败进步党派的选举联盟，并把他们的爪牙选进国会。我认为，在今天，工会最重要的任务之一是研究并分析美帝国主义在每个资本主义国家中的影响，并且在工人以及其他阶层人民中展开运动，进行揭发。
    曼迪斯说：几年以前，美帝国主义无耻地提出下列要求，作为给予锡兰“第四点”援助计划的条件：1、限制工会权利，镇压进步运动；2、便利美国投资；3、给予“亚洲基础会”进行活动的便利；4、允许美国为军事目的使用基地。由于人民的反对，我们没有接受这个援助。经验已经证明，任何接受美国援助的国家，都将变成美国的殖民地。
    他强调说：今天，美帝国主义的唯一目的就是要统治世界。美帝国主义正在扮演着纳粹主义的角色，但是规模更大，作法更为凶恶。在首脑会议的前夕，美国派遣U—2型飞机到苏联去进行间谍活动，这证明艾森豪威尔的“和平之谈”只不过是欺骗和虚假的。
    曼迪斯指出：为了加强和平，我们必须进行斗争，使一些国家摆脱美帝国主义的控制和影响。持久和平最可靠的保证就是孤立和削弱美帝国主义。殖民地以及各国被压迫的人民的斗争，也是对持久和平的另外一个巨大贡献。
    他说：今天，全世界被压迫的人民正在进行坚决的斗争，反对压迫者。曼迪斯在叙述了阿尔及利亚、古巴、伊拉克、土耳其、南朝鲜人民所进行的英勇斗争以后说，拉丁美洲、非洲、亚洲以及中东人民的斗争证明：殖民地以及各国被压迫人民的斗争正在汹涌澎湃地前进，地球上没有任何力量能够阻止和击败这个斗争，无论这些压迫者可能是如何的残酷和强大。他说，日本人民反对“日美军事条约”和推翻岸信介集团的斗争，正在发展壮大。这些斗争将继续发展，并且将继续以更大的力量和更大决心发展。它将继续加强和平阵营。曼迪斯强调指出：世界工联的神圣任务，就是要加强这些争取问题解决的力量，因为它们是坚强的大军，这支大军将站在维护世界和平的进步力量这一边。社会主义国家，特别是苏联、中华人民共和国以及德意志民主共和国，正在给被压迫者及与殖民主义作斗争的被压迫人民以巨大的兄弟般的援助，并和他们的代表联系。这个活动正在取得非常良好的结果。
    他说：在我结束讲话以前，我要讲几句话表明我们对自由工联的态度。我们必须为各级的团结而继续奋斗，但是，我们对于“自由工联”内部的美帝国主义的代理人揭露得不够。我们的确进行了批评，但是这是不够的。让自由工联的会员了解他们的某些领袖是怎样的人物吧。像乔治·米尼这些变节的“自由工联”的领袖们，是帝国主义的走狗，他们积极地支持帝国主义战争贩子的战争计划，巴结垄断资本家。必须把他们当作工人阶级的死敌加以无情的揭露。如果我们要争取“自由工联”领导机构中的正直分子和群众，必须正确地揭露这些人。他还指出，我们必须同自由工联及其会员团体里面的正直的工会工作者发展友好接触和联系。
