    Song of the Storm
    Guo Xiaochuan

    Dark clouds roll, lightning tears through the night,
    Thunder rumbles, violent waves shatter cliffs.
    The petrel dances in the sky, the dragon stirs the sea,
    The eagle spirals, fish and shrimp cry in woe.
    The anti-American struggle storm
            sweeps across the land,
    The anti-American struggle storm
            sweeps across the land.
    Whether you're at the earth's edge or the sky's corner,
            there is no exception!
    War drums beat on Mount Fuji,
    Resentment fills the Mediterranean,
    A great fire burns the Pacific Ocean,
    Fresh blood dyes the azaleas red.
    The hottest places
            are where the fighting is sweetest,
    The sweetest countries
            have become the hotbeds of struggle.
    The anti-American struggle storm
            sweeps across the land,
    The oppressed slaves
            will raise their heads high today
              with pride!
    Young students charge forward,
    Humble miners become commanders,
    Illiterate peasants sing war songs,
    Black people produce heroes.
    Jump onto the bed of the foreign overlords
                  and stomp three times,
    Ensuring that the shackles of colonialism
                  fall to dust.
    The anti-American struggle storm
            sweeps across the land,
    The suffering people
              will settle their debts of blood and sweat!
    Return my freedom,
    Return the heads on our shoulders,
    Return our motherland's rivers and mountains,
    Return our nation's lifeline!
    The imperialist war machine
              must not move a single step,
    Foreign puppets
            must obediently step down!
    The anti-American struggle storm
          sweeps across the land,
    “Plague gods,” liars, and lackeys
                      reveal their ugly forms.
    The press secretary becomes a prisoner,
    The plague god’s follower has his skull cracked,
    MacArthur sneaks out the back door,
    The dignified prime minister dares not leave his residence.
    Rats crossing the street
        are met with "eliminate the four pests,"
    "Eisenhower, get out!"
                    --That is considered
                    good hospitality.
    The anti-American struggle storm
            sweeps across the land,
    Never in human history
          has there been such a great
              era!
    Slaves are now turning themselves over,
    Imperialism is about to collapse,
    Heroes and martyrs soar in the sky,
    Colonialism is buried underground.
    The great revolution
          will transform the world's landscape,
              Living in such times
              is more joyful than being an immortal!
    The anti-American struggle storm
            sweeps across the land,
    Whether you are gold or dung,
                it’s hard to conceal.
    Are you marching ahead with enthusiasm,
    Or standing lazily outside the circle?
    Are you fiercely becoming a traitor,
    Or shamefully becoming a petty bourgeois?
    You must make a decision
              in this very moment;
    The impartial history
            will properly
                arrange you.
    The anti-American struggle storm
            sweeps across the land,
    On the road to victory
              grow a few patches of mud.
    Some have had enough of revolution,
    And talk about dressing up instead;
    Some are blinded by illusions,
    Wanting to beg for "peace" like beggars.
    The fake foreigners
          are waving their mourning sticks:
  "No revolution!"——
  Still obediently allowing themselves to be carved up.
    The anti-American struggle storm
            sweeps across the land,
    We cheer ten thousand times
              and applaud countless times.
    With a red heart for the revolution,
    Not afraid of robbers framing thieves,
    With a heart full of blood for friends,
    Not engaging in love with jackals.
    We do not fire the first shot,
              nor do we vaguely hang up
                a no-war sign,
    We sincerely love peace,
              but we do not abandon struggle and idly
                wait.
    The anti-American struggle storm
            sweeps across the land,
    You come so well,
          such heroic spirit!
    Clouds, fly even more bravely,
    Lightning, tear open the gates of heaven!
    Thunder, roar even louder,
    Violent waves, shatter the obstacles on the road ahead!
    Great storm,
        blow even more fiercely,
        Blow in a new
              era of red flowers blooming all over the ground and
              wonderful colors filling the sky!

    风暴之歌
    郭小川怒云滚滚，闪电把暗夜撕开，雷声隆隆，骇浪撞碎悬崖。海燕舞长空，蛟龙闹大海，苍鹰旋转飞，鱼虾叫声哀。反美斗争风暴
            铺天盖地来，反美斗争风暴
            铺天盖地来。管你地角天边
            哪能有什么例外！富士山头擂战鼓，地中海上怒满怀，大火烧开太平洋，鲜血染红金达莱。最热的地方
            战斗正甜，最甜的国家
          成了斗争的热带。反美斗争风暴
            铺天盖地来，被压迫的奴隶
            今天要扬眉吐气把
              头抬！年青的学生打冲锋，卑贱的矿工当统帅，目不识字的农民唱战歌，黑人群里出英才。跳上洋老爷的牙床
                  踩三踩，管叫殖民主义的枷锁
                  碎落尘埃。反美斗争风暴
            铺天盖地来，受苦受难的人民
              要算血汗债！还我身上的自由，还我肩上的脑袋，还我祖国的江山，还我民族的命脉！帝国主义的战车
              一步不许开，外国人的傀儡
            给我乖乖滚下台！反美斗争风暴
          铺天盖地来，“瘟神”、骗子、奴才
                      现丑态。新闻秘书当了阶下囚，瘟神随员破了天灵盖，麦克阿瑟偷偷走后门，堂堂首相不敢出住宅。老鼠过街
        碰上了“除四害”，“艾森豪威尔，滚回去！”
                    ——就算是
                    好招待。反美斗争风暴
            铺天盖地来，人类历史上
          何曾有过这样的大时
              代！奴隶于今要翻身，帝国主义要垮台，英雄志士天上飞，殖民主义地下埋。伟大的革命
          要把全世界的江山
              改，活在这样的年头
              比神仙还痛快！反美斗争风暴
            铺天盖地来，你是金子、是粪土
                都难以遮盖。是兴冲冲走在前头，还是懒洋洋站在圈外？是凶煞煞当个叛徒，还是灰溜溜当个市侩？全要你一时三刻
              作出抉择；铁面无私的历史
            将要把你妥安
                排。反美斗争风暴
            铺天盖地来，通向胜利的大道上
              长了几片泥苔。有人革命够啦，不讲革命讲穿戴；有人被幻想迷住啦，想讨“和平”当乞丐。假洋鬼子们
          更将那哭丧棒子甩：
  “不准革命”——
  还是服服贴贴任人割宰。    反美斗争风暴
            铺天盖地来，我们千万次欢呼
              万万声喝彩。一片红心为革命，不怕强盗把贼栽，满腔热血为朋友，不跟豺狼谈情爱。我们不打第一枪，
              也不含含糊糊挂
                起免战牌，我们诚心爱和平，
              却不丢下斗争空
                等待。反美斗争风暴
            铺天盖地来，你来得好呵，
          好一派英雄的气概！云头呵，更勇敢地飞吧，闪电呵，把天门打开！雷声呵，更大声地响吧，骇浪呵，击碎前进路上的障碍！大风暴呵，
        更猛烈地吹吧，吹来一个满地红花、
              满天异彩的新
                    时代！
