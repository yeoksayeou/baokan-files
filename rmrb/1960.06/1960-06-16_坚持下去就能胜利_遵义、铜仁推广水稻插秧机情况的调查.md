    Persistence Leads to Victory
    —An Investigation into the Promotion of Rice Transplanters in Zunyi and Tongren
    Agricultural Machinery Administration Working Group of the Ministry of Agriculture, Office Working Group of the Guizhou Tool Reform Committee
    The Superiority of Machine Transplanting
    Guizhou Province is determined, makes early arrangements, and has a fast manufacturing progress in promoting the use of rice transplanters. Some communes even cultivated seedlings early in order to test the transplanters. During the manufacturing process, during the training of operators, and during the promotion and use, party secretaries at all levels went deep into factories and fields to personally inspect and learn how to use the transplanters. Therefore, they have created and explored some valuable experiences in manufacturing and promotion, and trained a large number of manufacturing workers and machine transplanting operators. In the areas where we have seen more and better use of transplanters, the superiority of transplanters has been fully demonstrated. In Changping Management Area of Bahuang Commune in Tongren County (the key area of the county party first secretary), 428 mu of paddy fields used to take more than half a month to transplant by hand. This year, using 30 transplanters, all were machine transplanted and completed in five days. All communes that use transplanters more and better have greatly improved labor efficiency due to the use of transplanters. Many women and a few semi-laborers also use transplanters, thus freeing up a large number of strong laborers to devote themselves to the wheat and rapeseed harvest and field preparation. The more than 400 mu of machine-transplanted rice in Xieqiao Production Team of Xieqiao Management Area were transplanted using Jiangxi 59-type transplanters. The quality is good, the row and plant spacing is straight, and the number of seedlings per hill is uniform and neat. In terms of density, it is even better than manual transplanting. This is the greatest advantage of machine transplanting.
    The daily work efficiency of machine transplanting, as it appears now, is generally 1.5 to 2 mu; 1 mu and 4 to 5 mu are in the minority. In Mowan Management Area, three people with one machine transplant 2 mu per day, averaging about 0.7 mu per person. At a density of 3×7, the daily work efficiency of manual transplanting is generally only 0.3 to 0.5 mu. Moreover, most of the labor force投入 in machine transplanting are young women, while manual transplanting requires experienced and strong laborers. This is another advantage of machine transplanting.
    Five Main Experiences
    The experiences of mass promotion and use of transplanters can be summarized as follows:
    1. Persistence leads to victory. In the places we have seen, from manufacturing transplanters to training operators, from practicing with pine needles and straw to real combat, the general rule is that at the beginning, the enthusiasm is high, things are seen as very easy, and the situation is estimated to be very optimistic; but later, some difficulties arise, such as the poor manufacturing quality of some machines, the unfamiliarity of operators, the small number of seedlings transplanted, and the poor quality, so people waver. In the face of wavering thoughts among the masses and cadres, the Party strengthened its leadership, first solved ideological problems, and then solved specific problems one by one. By persevering, the situation was opened up and victory was achieved. Take Xieqiao Commune in Tongren County as an example: This commune started trial transplanting in Qiujiazhai on May 7th, with more than 40 people and five machines in the field. Each person only transplanted 0.2 to 0.3 mu per day. Some cadres and the masses began to waver. Some cadres suggested that the seedlings were getting older and older, and most of the fields had been prepared. The machine transplanting progress was slow, and the transplanters were unreliable. They wanted to abandon machine transplanting and switch to manual transplanting. Under the leadership of Comrade Yao Hongxian of the Agricultural and Industrial Department of the Prefectural Party Committee, the Party Committee held a meeting and proposed that the tighter the time, the more necessary it was to use transplanters, and it was necessary to persist. The first secretary of the Party Committee personally went to the fields, bringing nails and repair tools. When he found that the machine had problems, he adopted the method of using and repairing at the same time. Seeing that some seedling boxes were not loaded well, he directed the loading of the seedling boxes. On May 11th, a skill competition was held, with 40 machines in the field, and each person transplanted 0.4 to 0.5 mu in half a day. On the 21st, another skill competition was held, with 13 machines achieving a daily work efficiency of more than 3.5 mu, and the highest reaching 4.2 mu. Xieqiao Production Team transplanted a total of more than 900 mu, of which more than 800 mu were machine-transplanted, with high transplanting efficiency and meeting quality requirements. This fact shows that leading cadres must have firm thinking and a positive attitude towards the new thing of promoting the use of transplanters in order to help the masses use the transplanters well.
    2. There must be a reasonable labor organization to give full play to the power of the transplanter. It is not enough to have the means of production changed and productivity improved without a corresponding labor organization. All the communes that use transplanters more and better have initially explored some experiences. Some have organized specialized transplanter teams, which are divided into specialized groups according to work types such as transplanting, pulling seedlings, transporting seedlings, loading seedlings, and replanting seedlings. Some have two people per machine, packaging and transplanting, and others are responsible for supplying seedlings specifically for pulling and transporting seedlings. Others have three or four people as a machine transplanting group, taking care of pulling, transporting, loading, transplanting, and replanting. Still others organize machine transplanting teams by accounting unit (brigade), with three or four people equipped with one machine, fixing the plots, and moving to another plot after finishing one plot; among the three or four people, transplanting, loading, and replanting are rotated in the morning and afternoon; pulling and transporting seedlings are done by designated personnel. Another type is the nature of the shock team, which is specifically responsible for helping backward management areas or production teams with rush transplanting. Among the above organizational forms, it seems that organizing transplanting teams by accounting unit (brigade), dividing into groups according to the number of machines and tasks, contracting plots, and contracting tasks is better. Its advantages are that it meets the needs of production, facilitates centralized leadership, clarifies responsibilities, makes it easy to check the quality of transplanting and assess labor remuneration, and also facilitates the cooperation of carpenters for repairs, the exchange of experience between skilled and unskilled workers, and the development of red flag competitions. Some places implement the experience of matching people, machines, and fields, and having several contracts and several determinations, which is very good. However, which form is the best, and how many people should be in a machine group to be the most suitable still needs to be adapted to local conditions, time, and people, and further exploration and creation of experience are needed.
    3. It is necessary to create the necessary conditions for using transplanters. Promoting transplanters requires overcoming three hurdles—ideology, manufacturing, and technical skills. However, in actual transplanting, if the land is not leveled, the seedlings are not washed clean, the seedlings are not loaded neatly, and the depth of water is not appropriate, even if the machine is of good quality and the operating skills are proficient, it will still not be transplanted well. These are secondary problems, and if they are not resolved in time, they will develop into major contradictions.
    4. In the first year of mass use of transplanters, it is absolutely necessary to supplement machine transplanting with manual replanting. All the places that have done this have done well, ensuring the quality of transplanting. Machine transplanting has at least 20,000 hills per mu, and as many as 25,000 to 26,000 hills. Even the slowest three people can transplant 1.4 mu per day, which is also impossible for manual transplanting. Even if 20% of the hills are replanted by hand, it is still worthwhile in terms of labor accounting. As the skills of machine transplanting operators continue to improve, the rate of missed transplanting is gradually decreasing.
    5. Establishing pacesetters and launching the learn from, compare with, catch up with, surpass, and help movement is a good way to impart technology. At present, a large number of transplanting pacesetters and experts have emerged in various places, some of whom have a daily work efficiency of as much as 7 or 8 mu, but most ordinary transplanting operators are not yet skilled and have low work efficiency. How to improve the operating skills of the majority of transplanter operators to the existing level of pacesetters and experts is an important task. Widely launching the learn from, compare with, catch up with, surpass, and help movement can solve this problem well.
    Several Issues Worth Noting
    Guizhou Province has already achieved great success in promoting the use of transplanters. However, to achieve the goal of basically realizing the mechanization of transplanting throughout the province, as proposed by the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, arduous work is still required. Here are some issues and suggestions that we have seen for research and reference.
    1. Uneven development of work. Wherever the leadership is determined, enthusiastic, and the work is done thoroughly, the transplanters are promoted and used well; conversely, the promotion is poor. To overcome the problem of imbalance, on the one hand, it is necessary to promptly summarize and promote the experience of advanced regions, and on the other hand, it is necessary to help backward regions analyze the reasons for slow progress and the inability to promote transplanters. If there are ideological problems, solve the ideological problems; if there are practical problems, solve the practical problems. In particular, it is necessary to strengthen the confidence of the leaders of these regions in promoting transplanters, overcome the ideological tendency that "the season is urgent, there are many problems with the transplanters, and there is no time," and establish the idea that the tighter the time, the more necessary it is to do a good job in promoting transplanters. At the same time, carrying out cooperation and support between communes and teams is one of the important measures to promote the balanced development of work.
    2. Continue to improve the quality of transplanters. The best way is to combine leadership, manufacturing workers, and machine transplanting operators to conduct inspections and repairs through actual field operations. Machine models that have not been tested in production practice should not be manufactured in large quantities.
    3. How to correctly understand and implement the spirit of walking on two legs, with machine transplanting as the main and manual transplanting as the auxiliary, as pointed out by the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, still requires further work. The leaders of some communes have unclear thinking, and coupled with some problems encountered at the beginning of machine transplanting, which cannot be solved, some masses have concerns about machine transplanting, so they waver. On the surface, it is walking on two legs, but in reality, they simply give up machine transplanting and do not even try it. This issue is also worth noting.

    坚持下去就能胜利
    ——遵义、铜仁推广水稻插秧机情况的调查
    农业部农业机械管理局工作组  贵州工具改革委员会办公室工作组
    机插的优越性
    贵州省推广使用插秧机，决心大，部署早，制造进度快。有些公社为了试验插秧机，曾提早培育秧苗。在制造插秧机的过程中，在训练操作手时，在推广使用时，各级党委书记都深入工厂、田间，亲自进行检查和学习使用插秧机。因此在制造和推广使用方面，都创造和摸索了一些宝贵的经验，培养了大批制造工人和机插手。就我们看到的使用插秧机较多、较好的地区，都充分显示了插秧机的优越性。铜仁县坝黄公社长坪管理区（县委第一书记的重点）四百二十八亩水稻，往年插秧需要半个多月，今年使用三十部插秧机，全部机插，五天时间就完成了。凡是使用插秧机较多较好的公社，由于使用插秧机大大提高了劳动效率。使用插秧机的还有不少妇女和少数半劳动力，因而腾出了大批强壮劳动力投入抢收小麦、油菜和整田工作。谢桥管理区谢桥生产队的四百多亩机插水稻，有的是使用江西59型插秧机插的，质量好，行株距笔直，窝数、根数均匀整齐，在密度上更是手插所不及的。这是机插的最大优越性。
    机插的日工效，现在看来，一般是一亩半到二亩；一亩和四、五亩的都是少数。磨湾管理区三人一机日插二亩。平均每人七分左右；按3×7的密度，手插的日工效一般只能插三、五分地。而投入的劳动力，机插多数是青年妇女，手插则必须是老手、强壮的劳动力才行。这又是机插的一个优越性。
    五项主要经验
    大量推广使用插秧机的经验，可以概括为以下几点：
    一、坚持下去，就是胜利。我们看过的几个地方，从制造插秧机到训练操作手，从用松毛、稻草练武到真刀真枪上阵，一般规律是开始时劲头很大，把事情看得很容易，把情况估计得很乐观；但后来出现一些困难，如有些机子的制造质量不好，操作手不熟练，插的数量少，质量差，于是就动摇了。在群众、干部思想动摇不定的情况下，党加强了领导，首先解决思想问题，然后又一个一个地解决具体问题，坚持下来，就打开了局面，结果取得胜利。以铜仁县谢桥公社为例：这个公社，在5月7日从丘家寨开始试插，四十多个人，五部机子下田，一人一天只插二、三分。有些干部、群众便动摇了。有的干部提出，秧子越来越老，田也打好一大半了；机插进度慢，插秧机靠不住。他们想放弃机插，改用手插。在地委农工部姚洪显同志领导下，党委开了会，提出时间越紧，越需要使用插秧机，一定要坚持下去。党委第一书记亲自下田，自带钉子和修理工具，发现机子有毛病，采取边用、边修；看到有的装秧不好，就指挥装好秧箱。5月11日召开比武会，四十部机子下田，每人半天插到四、五分。21日又一次比武，有十三部机子日工效达到三亩半以上，最高的四亩二。谢桥生产队共插九百多亩，其中机插的就有八百多亩，插秧工效高，并达到质量要求。这一事实说明，对推广使用插秧机这件新事物，领导干部必须有坚定的思想和积极的态度，才能帮助群众用好插秧机。
    二，必须要有合理的劳动组织，才能充分发挥插秧机的威力。生产工具改变了，生产力提高了，没有相应的劳动组织形式是不行的。凡是使用插秧机较多、较好的公社，都初步摸索了一些经验。有的是组织了插秧机专业队，以下按工种分为插秧、扯（拔）秧、运秧、装秧、补秧等专业小组。有的是两个人一部机子，包装、包插，另有专门扯秧、运秧的人负责供应秧苗。也有的是三人或四人为一个机插组，扯、运、装、插、补完全包下来。还有的是以核算单位（大队）组织机插队，三人或四人配备一部机子，固定田块，这一块插完再到另外一块；三人或四人中，按上下午轮换插秧、装秧、补秧；扯秧、运秧都另设专人。再一种是突击队的性质，专门负责帮助落后的管理区或生产队进行抢插。上述这些组织形式，看来以核算单位（大队）组织插秧队，根据机子的数量和任务分成小组、包田块、包任务的办法较好。它的优点是适应生产的需要，便于集中领导，责任分明，容易检查插秧的质量和评记劳动报酬，同时便于木工配合修理，生手熟手交流经验，开展红旗竞赛等。有的地方实行人、机、田对号，几包、几定的经验是很好的。但是究竟那一种形式最好，一个机组到底要有几个人最适合，还需要因地、因时、因人制宜，进一步摸索和创造经验。
    三、必须给使用插秧机创造必要的条件。推广插秧机要过三关——思想、制造和使用技术。但是在实际插秧中，如果整地不平，洗秧不净，装秧不整齐，放水深浅不合适，就是机子质量好，操作技术熟练，也同样插不好。这些属于次要的问题，如不及时解决，就会发展成主要的矛盾。
    四、第一年大量使用插秧机，配合机插，用手插补苗，是完全必要的。各地凡是这样做了的，都很好，保证了插秧质量。机插每亩至少有两万窝，多的到两万五、六千窝。最慢的三个人日插一亩四，这也是手插办不到的。就是有20％的窝数用手插补，算劳力账也合得来。而随着机插手的技术不断提高，漏插率正在逐渐减少。
    五、树立标兵，开展学、比、赶、超、帮运动，是传授技术的好办法。目前各地都涌现出一大批插秧标兵和能手，他们之中有的日工效达七、八亩之多，但大多数普通插秧手，技术还不熟练，工效还低，如何把广大插秧机手的操作技术提高到标兵能手的现有水平，是一件重要的工作。广泛地开展学、比、赶、超、帮运动，可以很好地解决这个问题。几个值得注意的问题
    贵州省在推广使用插秧机这个工作上，已经获得很大成绩。但达到中共贵州省委提出的全省基本实现插秧机化的要求，还需作艰巨的工作。这里提出我们看到的几个问题和意见，供研究参考。
    一、工作发展不平衡。凡是领导决心大，干劲足，工作做得深透的地方，插秧机就推广使用的好，反之就推广的差。克服不平衡的问题，一面需要及时总结、推广先进地区的经验，一面要帮助落后地区分析进度慢和不能推广插秧机的原因，有思想问题就解决思想问题，有实际问题就解决实际问题，特别要坚定这些地区领导对推广插秧机的信心，克服那种“认为季节紧迫，插秧机问题多，时间来不及”的思想倾向，树立时间愈紧，愈要做好推广插秧机的思想。同时开展社与社、队与队之间的协作支援，是促进工作平衡发展的重要措施之一。
    二、继续改进插秧机的质量。最好的办法，是领导、制造工人、机插手三结合，通过田间实际操作，进行检查和修理。对没有在生产实践中考验过的机子型号，就不应大批制造。
    三、如何正确理解和贯彻执行中共贵州省委指出的以机插为主、手插为辅的两条腿走路的精神，还要进一步作些工作。有的公社领导思想不明确，加上开始机插遇到的一些问题，得不到解决，有些群众对机插有顾虑，于是就动摇起来，表面上是两条腿走路，实际上则干脆放弃机插，连试验都不试验。这个问题也很值得注意。
