Xinhua News Agency report:

    Jian'ou County in Fujian Province, while vigorously cultivating and utilizing wild plants, is also actively establishing wild fiber processing factories. Currently, the county has already set up 222 processing factories.

    Jian'ou County is located in the mountainous area of northern Fujian, with very abundant wild plant resources. After investigation, it has been initially discovered that there are more than 1,230 species that can be utilized, of which the annual output of wild fiber plants alone reaches 200 million jin. In light of the above situation, relevant departments and people's communes in Jian'ou County, under the unified leadership of the county party committee, put forward the slogan "Demand sugar, oil, and wine from barren mountains, and ask wild grass to contribute cotton, cloth, and hemp." The commercial department organized more than 500 cadres and technicians to cooperate with local stores and purchasing stations to establish wild plant collection and processing service stations, working with the people's communes to mobilize commune members to collect and utilize wild plants. At the same time, adopting the methods of self-reliance, using indigenous methods, and combining indigenous and foreign methods, 222 wild fiber processing factories were established.

    Jian'ou County pays great attention to the protection and cultivation of wild fiber resources, educating commune members to adopt methods such as cutting stems and leaving roots, removing branches and leaving trunks, and digging side stems and leaving mother stems when collecting. They also combine afforestation, land reclamation, and other production activities to artificially cultivate wild plants, gradually transforming some wild plants into domesticated ones. In the first four months of this year, communes, organizations, and schools throughout the county have utilized barren and vacant land to plant more than 5,000 mu of wild fiber plants.

    建瓯大办野生纤维加工厂
    据新华社讯　福建省建瓯县在大力培植和利用野生植物的同时，大办野生纤维加工厂。目前全县已办起加工厂二百二十二个。
    建瓯县地处闽北山区，野生植物资源非常丰富，经过调查，已初步发现可以利用的有一千二百三十多种，其中，仅野生纤维植物的产量每年就达两亿斤。根据上述情况，建瓯县各有关部门和人民公社都在县委统一领导下，提出“向荒山要糖要油要酒，叫野草献棉献布献麻”的口号，由商业部门组织了五百多名干部和技术人员，配合各地门市部、收购站建立野生植物采集加工服务站，协同人民公社发动社员采集和利用野生植物。同时，采取自力更生、土法上马、土洋结合的办法，建立了野生纤维加工厂二百二十二个。
    建瓯县很注意野生纤维资源的防护培养工作，教育社员在采集时，采用砍茎留根、去枝留干、挖边茎留母茎等办法，还结合造林、开荒等生产，人工培植野生植物，使某些野生植物逐步变为家生。在今年头四个月中，全县各公社和机关、学校已利用荒地空地种植了五千多亩野生纤维植物。
