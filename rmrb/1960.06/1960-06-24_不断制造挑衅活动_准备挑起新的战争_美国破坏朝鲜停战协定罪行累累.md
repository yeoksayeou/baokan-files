Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 19th: Our correspondent reports: Since the Korean armistice on July 27, 1953, the US imperialism headed by Eisenhower has been systematically and brutally violating the armistice agreement, strengthening its military forces in South Korea, turning South Korea into its atomic strategic base for launching a new war, and preparing to provoke a new war. The crimes of US imperialism in undermining the armistice agreement are too numerous to mention.

	Illegally Detaining Korean and Chinese Prisoners of War

	Before and after the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the US side broke its word and illegally detained more than 48,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, forcibly incorporating them into the armies of the Syngman Rhee group and the Chiang Kai-shek group. After the Korean armistice, US imperialism violated the armistice agreement by illegally transporting large quantities of war materials into South Korea and expanding the Syngman Rhee puppet army from sixteen divisions to thirty-one divisions (including ten reserve divisions).

	Forcibly Expelling the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission

	In June 1956, US imperialism unilaterally and forcibly expelled the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, which was supervising the Korean armistice, from South Korea. Moreover, in June 1957, it unilaterally abolished Article 13(d) of the Korean Armistice Agreement, which prohibited the introduction of reinforcing combat equipment from outside Korea, blatantly turning South Korea into a US atomic base.

	Illegally Importing Various Missiles

	Subsequently, in 1957, US imperialism reorganized the Seventh Division and the First Cavalry Division stationed in South Korea into atomic divisions, and successively illegally transported "Honest John" rockets, 280mm atomic cannons, and "Matador" missiles into South Korea. Disregarding repeated protests and condemnations from the Korean and Chinese sides, US imperialism recently went further and illegally transported "Nike-Hercules" and "Hawk" missiles into South Korea. Furthermore, on February 26 and April 19 this year, it launched "Matador" missiles and "Honest John" rockets in South Korea. Magruder, the commander of the US forces occupying South Korea, has also continuously clamored to continue transporting new weapons, including various missiles, into South Korea to "enhance" the "atomic strike capability" of the US forces occupying South Korea; he also clamored to equip the South Korean puppet army with modern weapons. Manufacturing Provocative Incidents on the Military Demarcation Line

	At the same time, US imperialism has continuously created provocative activities along the military demarcation line. According to statistics, from the armistice to October 14, 1959, the US side committed 863 hostile acts against the Korean and Chinese sides, which were formally submitted to the Armistice Commission by the Korean and Chinese sides.

	Taking recent incidents as an example, on May 19 and June 11 this year, US military aircraft illegally crossed the military demarcation line and intruded into the airspace over Anxia and Jiuhuali (approximately five kilometers north of the military demarcation line) in the Korean and Chinese area for reconnaissance activities. On May 4, US naval vessels also intruded into the waters of the Korean and Chinese area and fired machine cannons at Korean and Chinese vessels for more than 20 minutes.

	According to Major General Zhu Changjun, the chief commissioner of the Korean and Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, who revealed at the 119th meeting of the Military Armistice Commission, the US side recently violated Article 1, paragraph 1 of the Armistice Agreement, actively preparing for war in the demilitarized zone and openly carrying out military provocations and reconnaissance activities against the Korean and Chinese side. US personnel even secretly or openly laid mines in the demilitarized zone, illegally brought automatic weapons such as machine guns and carbines into the demilitarized zone, and fired at the civil police of the Korean and Chinese side. On March 29 this year, US personnel fired more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition from heavy machine guns into the Korean and Chinese area. In addition, the US side has continuously dispatched a large number of special agents to intrude into the Korean and Chinese area for reconnaissance and sabotage activities.

	Constantly Holding Military Exercises

	Since the armistice, the US aggressor troops have also continuously conducted various provocative military exercises in South Korea. Just before Eisenhower's visit to South Korea, a total of 63 vessels from the US Seventh Fleet and the South Korean puppet navy conducted a joint landing operation exercise in the Yingil Bay area of Pohang Port in South Korea for five days starting from the early morning of June 14.

### 不断制造挑衅活动　准备挑起新的战争  美国破坏朝鲜停战协定罪行累累

    不断制造挑衅活动　准备挑起新的战争
    美国破坏朝鲜停战协定罪行累累
    新华社平壤19日电　本社记者报道：以艾森豪威尔为头目的美帝国主义自从1953年7月27日朝鲜停战以来，一直有计划地粗暴地破坏停战协定，在南朝鲜增强军事力量，把南朝鲜变为它发动新战争的原子战略基地，准备挑起新的战争。美帝国主义破坏停战协定的罪行罄竹难书。
  非法扣留朝中被俘人员
    在朝鲜停战协定签字前后，美方背信弃义，非法扣留了朝中方面被俘人员四万八千多名，把他们强迫编入李承晚集团和蒋介石集团的军队。朝鲜停战后，美帝国主义就违反停战协定，非法把大量的作战物资运入南朝鲜，把李承晚伪军由十六个师扩充到了三十一个师（其中包括十个预备师）。
  强行驱逐中立国视察小组
    美帝国主义在1956年6月又片面强行将监督朝鲜停战的中立国视察小组由南朝鲜驱逐出去，而且在1957年6月又片面废除了关于禁止自朝鲜境外运入增援性作战物资的朝鲜停战协定第十三款卯项，明目张胆地把南朝鲜变为美国的原子基地。
    非法运入各式导弹
    接着，美帝国主义在1957年把驻在南朝鲜的第七师和骑兵第一师改编为原子师，并且陆续把“诚实的约翰”式火箭、二百八十公厘原子炮和“斗牛士”式导弹等非法运入南朝鲜。美帝国主义不顾朝中方面屡次的抗议和谴责，不久以前又进而把“奈克—赫尔克里士”式和
  “隼”式导弹非法运入南朝鲜，而且在今年2月26日和4月19日，在南朝鲜发射了“斗牛士”式导弹、
  “诚实的约翰”式火箭。强占在南朝鲜的美军的司令马格鲁德还不断叫嚣要继续把包括各种导弹在内的新式武器运入南朝鲜，“增强”霸占南朝鲜的美军的“原子攻击能力”；他还叫嚷要以现代化武器装备南朝鲜的伪军。在军事分界线制造挑衅事件
    与此同时，美帝国主义连续不断地在军事分界线一带制造挑衅活动。据统计，自从停战以来到1959年10月14日，美方对朝中方面的敌对行为，仅朝中方面正式向停战委员会提出的就有八百六十三起。
    拿最近发生的事件来说，在今年5月19日和6月11日，分别有美方军用飞机非法越过军事分界线，侵入朝中方面地区安峡、九华里
  （军事分界线以北约五公里）等地上空进行侦察活动。5月4日还有美方的海军舰艇侵入朝中方面地区的海面，向朝中方面舰艇发射机关炮二十多分钟。
    据军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员朱昌骏少将在军事停战委员会第一百一十九次会议上揭露，美方最近违反停战协定第一条第一款，竟在非军事区内积极备战，公开对朝中方面进行军事挑衅和侦察活动。美方人员甚至秘密地或公开地在非军事区内敷设地雷，把机关枪和卡宾枪等自动武器非法带入非军事区，并且向朝中方面民政警察射击。今年3月29日，美方人员竟用重机关枪向朝中方面地区发射了一千多发子弹。另外，美方还不断派遣大量特务侵入朝中方面地区进行侦察和破坏活动。
    不断举行军事演习
    停战以来，美国侵略军还不断在南朝鲜进行各种挑衅性军事演习。就在艾森豪威尔来南朝鲜的前夕，美国第七舰队和南朝鲜傀儡海军的舰艇共六十三艘在南朝鲜浦项港的迎日湾一带从6月14日清晨开始进行为时五天的联合登陆作战演习。
