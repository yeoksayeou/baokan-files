Comrade Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Honorable Mayor Peng Zhen, Dear Comrades, Citizens of Beijing:

I feel very happy to have the opportunity to pay tribute here to the representatives of the working class, laboring farmers, and people's intellectuals of brotherly China, and through you to convey the warmest brotherly respect of the Albanian people to the excellent Chinese people. Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people, united in eternal friendship with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, are smoothly building a beautiful socialist life and making extremely significant contributions to the cause of defending world peace.

At the invitation of Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, we have come to your country for a friendly visit to gain an in-depth understanding of the great achievements you have made, and to see with our own eyes the inspiring and selfless labor and tireless efforts of the 650 million great Chinese people who are rapidly changing the face of their motherland.

We sincerely thank Comrade Chairman Liu Shaoqi for the invitation and the kind reception given to us. Today is the third day since we arrived in your beautiful capital and lived with the hard-working, humble, and kind Chinese comrades. From the first day at the airport, and afterwards at Comrade Liu Shaoqi's banquet, in meeting with thousands of university students at "Tsinghua" University, and in visiting the Summer Palace and the Agricultural Exhibition, we saw and once again experienced the great Chinese people's love, special respect, and brotherly friendship for the Albanian people.

Such a reception once again clearly illustrates the new type of completely equal and genuine fraternal relations between the countries of our socialist camp.

Today, the whole world is witnessing the great socialist transformation of the Chinese people in the economic and cultural fields. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Chinese people have achieved a very great leap forward. The invincible Marxism-Leninism, patriotism, and creative drive, as well as the great mobilization of all the working people under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, are the sources of your brilliant achievements on the road of progress and creation of happiness. The victories achieved by the fraternal Chinese people in socialist construction make the Albanian people and all our friends rejoice, while frightening our common enemies - the imperialists and revisionists.

The entire socialist world and all adults and children in our country are proud of your achievements, while China's enemies are terrified. Because these achievements are beneficial to socialism and peace, and are a blow to capitalism and warmongers.

Dear comrades, the Albanian people have also made significant achievements, changing the face of their motherland. Albania is being built from a backward agricultural country of sixteen years ago into a prosperous socialist country. Industrial production has increased twenty-one and a half times compared to pre-war levels. Agricultural collectivization has been almost entirely completed, and a genuine cultural revolution is currently being implemented to advance education, science, and art. The Albanian people have achieved these accomplishments under the long-tested Marxist-Leninist leadership of the Albanian Party of Labor, and with the generous and decisive assistance from the Soviet Union, the liberator and great friend of the Albanian people. In our struggle to construct socialism, the Chinese people and other people's democratic countries have also given us tremendous assistance.

All these common victories and achievements of ours demonstrate the undeniable superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system and the tremendous power of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

Dear comrades and friends!

The current international situation shows that the balance of power in the world is in favor of socialism, that the socialist system is infinitely superior to the capitalist system, and that the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has become an indestructible pillar of peace and freedom for all peoples.

The recent events in South Korea, Turkey, and Japan, as well as the rising tide of national liberation movements in Africa and South America, illustrate the further weakening of the capitalist system. However, imperialism is doing its best to intensify international tensions by adopting new methods, opposing peaceful coexistence, and hindering the solution of outstanding issues.

The U.S. sending spy planes to violate Soviet airspace is an anti-Soviet act of aggression and a criminal policy. The official attitude of the U.S. government indicating that it will continue to implement this espionage policy in the future is not only a challenge to the Soviet Union's many efforts to defend and strengthen peace, but also a deliberate act of sabotage against the Four-Power Summit Conference that should have been held in Paris.

The U.S. imperialist policy of espionage and sabotage threatens the national sovereignty and freedom of all countries. Therefore, our entire socialist camp and all progressive forces in the world unanimously condemn this despicable act of the U.S. government and fully support the correct position of the Soviet Union.

The Soviet Union's historically great victories on the road of communist construction, its astonishing achievements in science and technology, and its unswerving struggle to ease international tensions, ensure peace, avoid atomic disaster, and resolve outstanding issues through negotiation, unite the people of the world around the Soviet Union. We regard the Soviet Union as the standard-bearer and powerful defender of safeguarding the vital interests of mankind.

Despite the fact that U.S. imperialists responded to the Soviet Union's peaceful policies with acts of aggression and provocation, the people of our countries will continue to fight for the peaceful resolution of outstanding issues.

The prospect of socialist victory and ensuring peace is becoming increasingly clear to the people of the world. The big family of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is advancing and strengthening, and is more united than ever.

The People's Republic of China has entered its eleventh year. With its peaceful policies, it plays a significant role on the international stage, and it has become an important factor not only for peace in Asia, but also for world peace. No international problem can be resolved without the participation of the People's Republic of China. The United Nations Organization cannot become a true international institution if the representative of the People's China, which accounts for a quarter of the world's population, has not had its legitimate seat restored.

The short-sighted diplomatic strategy of the United States and some other countries is unwilling to recognize the legitimate government of the People's Republic of China, the sole representative of the great Chinese people. The United States makes itself a laughingstock to the world with its unreasonable attitude. U.S. imperialists are vainly trying to spread and defend its reactionary and hostile "two Chinas" theory. The United States forcibly and barbarously occupies Taiwan, attempting to separate the island from its motherland. However, the imperialists have forgotten the facts of history, and the times are not developing in their favor. Taiwan is China's sacred territory, and no one can separate it. The provocative and aggressive actions of U.S. imperialism against China are provocative and aggressive actions against the entire socialist camp.

Comrades,

The establishment and prosperity of the People's Republic of China, the People's Republic of Albania, and all people's democratic countries clearly demonstrate the victory of the immortal ideas of Marxism-Leninism. Our friendship is cemented by our Marxist-Leninist parties in the sacred struggle for freedom, peace, and socialism, intertwined with love for the glorious Soviet Union, and illuminated by Marxist-Leninist thought; it will last forever as a shining example of the high principles of proletarian internationalism. The world-historical victory of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is due to the scientific creation of immortal Marxism-Leninism. Our strength lies in loyalty to this invincible theory, in the ideological unity and policy consistency of our camp. Our enemies are launching frenzied attacks on our unity and solidarity. For this sinister purpose, they use the Yugoslav revisionists bought with American dollars to serve them. The recent congress of the Socialist Alliance of Yugoslavia is a new example of the close cooperation between the Belgrade revisionists and U.S. imperialism. This proves that the Yugoslav revisionists have not abandoned their despicable role of playing the "Trojan horse." The Albanian Party of Labor and the Communist Parties and Workers' Parties of other countries, headed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, have fulfilled their internationalist obligations, and have resolutely and principally waged and will continue to wage the struggle against modern revisionism, especially against the Belgrade revisionist group, the advance detachment of U.S. imperialism, because, as the historical Moscow Declaration pointed out and as life has fully confirmed, the main danger of the international workers' movement and the communist movement remains right opportunism and revisionism.

The despicable mission of the Yugoslav revisionists, at the behest of imperialism, to "break the fortress from within" in order to split our socialist camp has been and will continue to be defeated. The socialist family headed by the Soviet Union is unbreakable, and it is more united than ever. No force can split our unity, because our friendship and unity are required by life and have become an objective historical necessity.

Dear Comrades,

The Albanian people heartily thank the great Chinese people for the fraternal assistance given in the construction of socialist society. He will always cherish the precious friendship that unites the peoples of our two countries. Although the peoples of our two countries are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, and vast oceans, the correct policies of our Marxist-Leninist parties have forever eliminated this distance and obstacle. Our friendship has taken root and sprouted deep in the hearts of the peoples of our two countries who are fighting for socialism and communism. They will always remain vigilant against all attempts by imperialism, and will defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism and the unity and solidarity of the socialist camp as they would protect their eyes. Our two countries will work side by side with the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries to maintain and ensure world peace, smash the imperialist policy of aggression, and make every effort for the victory of the immortal Marxist-Leninist ideas.

Long live the eternal friendship linking the Albanian and Chinese peoples!

Long live the heroic Communist Party of China and its outstanding leader Mao Zedong!

Long live the People's Republic of China, headed by Comrade Liu Shaoqi!

Long live the great Soviet Union and the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

Long live world peace!

    我们要像保护眼睛一样捍卫马克思列宁主义
    哈奇·列希主席在北京各界欢迎大会上的讲话尊敬的刘少奇主席，尊敬的彭真市长，亲爱的同志们，北京的市民们：
    我感到非常幸福，有机会在这里荣幸地向兄弟中国的工人阶级、劳动农民和人民知识界的代表们致以敬意，并通过你们转达阿尔巴尼亚人民对优秀的中国人民的最热烈的兄弟般的敬意。中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的英明领导下，同苏联和社会主义阵营的其他国家结成永恒的友谊，正在顺利地建设着社会主义的美好生活，并且为保卫世界和平的事业作出极其重大的贡献。
    我们应中华人民共和国主席刘少奇同志的邀请，来到你们的国家进行友好访问，以便深入地了解你们所取得的巨大成就，亲眼看看你们鼓舞人心的和忘我的劳动和正在迅速改变自己祖国面貌的六亿五千万伟大的中国人民的不倦的努力。
    我们衷心地感谢刘少奇主席同志的邀请和给予我们的良好接待。今天是我们到达你们美丽的首都，同热爱劳动、谦虚和亲切的中国同志，在一起生活的第三天，从第一天在飞机场上，以及其后，在刘少奇同志的宴会上，在同“清华”大学的数千名大学生的会见中，在参观颐和园和农业展览会中，我们看到并且再一次体会到伟大的中国人民对阿尔巴尼亚人民的热爱、特别的尊重和兄弟般的友谊。
    这样的接待再一次清楚地说明了我们社会主义阵营各国之间的新型的完全平等的真正的兄弟关系。
    今天，全世界都是中国人民在经济和文化方面进行着伟大的社会主义改造的见证人。中国人民在共产党的领导下，实现了非常巨大的跃进。战无不胜的马克思列宁主义，爱国主义和创造性的干劲，以及在中国共产党英明领导下的全体劳动人民的伟大动员是你们在前进和创造幸福的道路上取得这些光辉成就的源泉。兄弟的中国人民在社会主义建设中取得的胜利使阿尔巴尼亚人民和所有我们的朋友欢欣鼓舞，而使我们的共同敌人——帝国主义和修正主义者胆战心惊。
    整个社会主义世界和我们国家的所有大人和小孩都为你们的成就而自豪，而中国的敌人却胆战心惊。因为这些成就有利于社会主义和和平，是对资本主义和战争挑拨者的打击。
    亲爱的同志们，阿尔巴尼亚人民也取得了重大的成就，改变了祖国的面貌。阿尔巴尼亚从十六年以前的落后农业国正在建成为一个繁荣的社会主义国家。工业产量比战前增长了二十一点五倍。农业合作化差不多已全部完成，目前正在实现把教育、科学和艺术引向前进的真正的文化革命。阿尔巴尼亚人民是在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的久经考验的马克思列宁主义领导下，在阿尔巴尼亚人民的解放者和伟大的朋友——苏联的慷慨和具有决定意义的援助下取得这些成就的。在我们建设社会主义的斗争中，中国人民和其他人民民主国家也给予了我们巨大的援助。
    我们的所有这些共同的胜利和成就显示了社会主义制度对资本主义制度的不容置疑的优越性、以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的强大威力。
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们！
    当前的国际局势说明世界的力量对比有利于社会主义，说明社会主义制度无比优越于资本主义制度，说明以苏联为首的社会主义阵营成了各国人民和平和自由的不可摧毁的支柱。
    最近，在南朝鲜、土耳其、日本发生的事件，以及非洲和南美的民族解放运动的高涨，说明了资本主义制度的进一步削弱。但是，帝国主义正尽力企图采用新的手段加剧国际紧张局势，反对和平共处，阻碍悬而未决问题的解决。
    美国派遣间谍飞机侵犯苏联领空这种反苏的侵略行为和罪恶政策，以及美国政府表示今后继续执行这一间谍活动政策的官方态度，不仅是对苏联为保卫和加强和平的多次努力进行挑战，而且是对应当在巴黎召开的四国政府首脑会议的蓄意破坏行为。
    美帝国主义的间谍破坏政策威胁着各国的国家主权和自由。因此，我们整个社会主义阵营和世界全体进步力量一致谴责美国政府的这一卑鄙行为，全力拥护支持苏联的正确立场。
    苏联在共产主义建设道路上取得的具有历史意义的伟大胜利，在科学和技术方面取得的惊人成就，为缓和国际紧张局势、确保和平和避免原子灾难、用谈判方式解决悬而未决的问题而进行的始终不渝的斗争，把全世界的人民团结在苏联的周围，我们把苏联看成是保卫人类切身利益的旗手和强有力的保卫者。
    尽管美国帝国主义者用侵略和挑衅的行动回答了苏联的和平政策，我们各国人民仍将继续进行为以和平方式解决悬而未决的问题的斗争。
    社会主义胜利和确保和平的前景对于世界各国人民愈益明显。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营大家庭正在前进并增强，比任何时候都更加团结。
    中华人民共和国进入了它的第十一个年头。它以其和平政策在国际舞台上起着重大的作用，它成了不仅是亚洲和平、而且是世界和平的重要因素。没有中华人民共和国的参加，任何国际问题都不能得到解决。如果占世界人口四分之一的人民中国的代表没有恢复在联合国中的合法席位，联合国组织就不能成为一个真正的国际机构。
    美国和某些其他国家的短见的外交战略，不愿意承认伟大的中国人民的唯一代表中华人民共和国的合法政府。美国以其无理的态度而贻笑于全世界。美帝国主义者徒劳无益地拼命散布并辩解它的反动的、敌视的关于两个中国的“理论”。美国用武力野蛮地侵占着台湾，企图把这个岛屿同它的祖国母亲分离开。但是，帝国主义者忘记了历史事实，而且时代也并不是向有利于他们的方向发展。台湾是中国的神圣领土，任何人也不能分离它。美帝国主义对中国进行的挑衅和侵略行动，也就是针对整个社会主义阵营的挑衅和侵略行动。
    同志们，
    中华人民共和国、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国和所有人民民主国家的成立和繁荣明显地表现了马克思列宁主义不朽思想的胜利。我们的友谊是我们马克思列宁主义党在为自由、和平和社会主义的神圣斗争中凝结起来的，是以对光荣的苏联的热爱交织起来的，是受马克思列宁主义思想所照耀的；它将如无产阶级国际主义高度原则性的光辉典范一样地永世长存。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的具有世界历史性的胜利，归功于不朽的马克思列宁主义的科学创造。我们的力量就在于对这无往不胜的理论的忠实性，在于我们阵营的思想团结和政策的一致性。我们的敌人对我们的团结和一致进行疯狂的进攻。为了这一罪恶的目的，他们便将美金收买的南斯拉夫修正主义者用来为己服务。南斯拉夫社会主义联盟最近的一次代表大会是贝尔格莱德修正主义者与美帝国主义紧密合作的新例证。这证明了南斯拉夫修正主义者还没有放弃它扮演“特洛伊木马”的卑鄙角色的作用。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和以苏联共产党为首的其他各国共产党和工人党完成了它们的国际主义义务，曾经并将继续坚决和原则地进行反对现代修正主义特别是反对美帝国主义前哨别动队——贝尔格莱德修正主义集团的斗争，因为正如历史性的莫斯科宣言所指出的，和生活所完全证实了的一样，国际工人运动和共产主义运动的主要危险仍然是右倾机会主义和修正主义。
    南斯拉夫修正主义奉帝国主义之命“从内部攻破堡垒”以分裂我们社会主义阵营的卑鄙使命遭到了并将继续遭到失败，以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭是牢不可破的，它比任何时候都更团结一致，没有一种力量能分裂我们的团结，因为我们的友谊和团结一致是生活所要求的，已成为客观历史的必然性。
    亲爱的同志们，
    阿尔巴尼亚人民衷心地感谢伟大的中国人民在社会主义社会的建设中所给予的兄弟般的援助。他将永远珍惜团结我们两国人民的珍贵友谊。我们两国人民相隔千山万水，汪洋大海，但我们马克思列宁主义的党的正确政策永远消除了这种距离和障碍，我们的友谊在为社会主义和共产主义而斗争的我们两国人民的心灵深处已经生根发芽。对于帝国主义的一切企图，他们都将永远保持着警惕性，将像保护眼睛一样的捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性、社会主义阵营的团结和一致。我们两国将同苏联和其他兄弟国家并肩携手为维护和确保世界和平，粉碎帝国主义的侵略政策，为不朽的马克思列宁主义思想的胜利而进行一切努力。
    联结阿尔巴尼亚人民和中国人民的永恒友谊万岁！
    英雄的中国共产党和其卓越的领袖毛泽东万岁！
    以刘少奇同志为首的中华人民共和国万岁！
    伟大的苏联和以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
