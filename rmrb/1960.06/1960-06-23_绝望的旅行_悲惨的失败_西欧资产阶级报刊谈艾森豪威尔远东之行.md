Xinhua News Agency, June 21st - Western European bourgeois newspapers admit that the failure of Eisenhower's robber trip to the Far East once again reflects the bankruptcy of American foreign policy.

The British "News Chronicle" today published an article by James Cameron, mocking Eisenhower's speeches during his Far East tour as "showing astonishing unwisdom."

Cameron quoted the lies Eisenhower told to the angry masses in Okinawa: "We (the United States) want to maintain the good relationship that exists between you and our country," and he mocked, "This relationship is so intimate that it requires 12,000 armed personnel to protect the president."

Cameron sarcastically said, "It is easy to blindly attribute what happened in Japan and Okinawa to Chinese Communism, but that is tantamount to Pavlov's dog used to test conditioned reflexes."

The "Daily Express" today published an article by Michael Foot, who wrote that the bankruptcy of American policy "is due to the American idea of pretending that Communist China does not exist, and trying to organize the rest of the world entirely into military treaties against Communist countries."

Foot pointed out that the American "policy just doesn't work," which is "a problem of the failure of the entire Western policy."

The West German "Deutsche Wochenzeitung," in its June 22nd issue published in advance, published an editorial believing that Eisenhower originally intended to "gloriously end" his presidency with a visit to the Far East and emphasize America's "power and influence," but precisely the large-scale demonstrations in Tokyo have clearly shown the world that America's "influence is increasingly disappearing."

The magazine said that in South Korea, Turkey, and Japan—three countries where the American military base system plays a decisive role—American policy has suffered severe blows. The magazine pointed out that Syngman Rhee and Menderes have already fallen, and the "lifespan" of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet is not long.

The "Neue Rhein Zeitung" editorial on the 20th said, "Kishi Nobusuke's days are numbered." The newspaper said, "It cannot be assumed now that the (U.S.-Japan) security treaty is already effective and the issue has been resolved."

The Italian Milanese newspaper "ABC" commented on the policy of the U.S. State Department, saying, "This is a mistaken great power policy." The newspaper believes that American military bases in other countries should be abolished.

The weekly "Forum" pointed out that Eisenhower's Far East trip was a "desperate trip."

The Turin "People's Daily" admitted that "the events of recent months, especially the serious and sensational events that occurred in Tokyo, have put the representatives of us in the West in the dock…".

The "Sunday Times" commented on the 19th under the title "Tokyo Disappointment," saying that the United States in the Far East "often encounters difficulties, and now it has encountered difficulties in its key location, Japan." The newspaper admitted that the anti-American sentiment of the Japanese people is due to the American acts of slaughtering Asian people with atomic bombs, occupying Japan for many years, and imposing a policy of hostility towards China on the Japanese people.

### 绝望的旅行  悲惨的失败  西欧资产阶级报刊谈艾森豪威尔远东之行

    绝望的旅行  悲惨的失败
    西欧资产阶级报刊谈艾森豪威尔远东之行
    据新华社21日讯　西欧国家资产阶级报刊承认，艾森豪威尔在远东的强盗旅行的失败，再一次反映了美国外交政策的破产。
    英国“新闻纪事报”今天发表詹姆斯·凯麦隆的一篇文章，嘲笑艾森豪威尔在远东旅行中的讲话“显出惊人的不智”。
    凯麦隆引用了艾森豪威尔向冲绳怒吼的群众所说的谎话：“我们（美国）希望保持你们和我们国家之间存在的良好关系”，他嘲笑说，“这种关系竟亲切到如此程度，以致要一万二千名武装人员来保护这位总统。”
    凯麦隆挖苦说，“把日本和冲绳发生的情况盲目地归咎于中国共产主义，那是很容易的事情，但是这样就无异于巴甫洛夫用以试验条件反射的一条狗了。”
    “每日快报”今天发表迈克尔·富特的一篇文章，作者写道，美国政策的破产“是由于美国人装作共产党中国不存在的主意，以及试图把世界的其余部分完全组织在针对共产党国家的军事条约中”。
    富特指出，美国“这个政策就是不起作用”，这是“整个西方政策失败的问题”。
    西德提前出版的“德意志周报”6月22日一期发表社论认为，艾森豪威尔本来打算以访问远东来“辉煌地结束”他的总统职务，并强调一下美国的“势力和影响”，但是，恰好东京的大示威已经向全世界清楚地表明美国的“影响日益消失”。
    这家杂志说，在南朝鲜、土耳其和日本——美国的军事基地体系起决定性作用的三个国家里，美国的政策遭到严重的打击。杂志指出，李承晚和曼德列斯已经垮台了，岸信介内阁的“寿命”已经不长了。
      “新莱因报”20日的社论说，“岸信介的日子屈指可数了”。这家报纸说，“现在决不能认为（美日）安全条约已经有效，问题已经解决了。”
    意大利米兰的“ABC”报评论美国国务院的政策时说，“这是一个错误的大国政策”。报纸认为，应该取消美国在别国的军事基地。
      “论坛”周刊指出艾森豪威尔的远东之行是“绝望的旅行”。
    都灵“人民日报”承认，“最近几个月的事件，特别是在东京发生的严重的轰动一时的事件，把我们西方的代表推到被告席上……”。
    “星期日泰晤士报”19日以“东京沮丧”为题的评论说，美国在远东“常常遇到困难，而现在竟然在它的关键性地点日本遭到了困难”。报纸承认，日本人民的反美情绪，是由于美国用原子弹屠杀亚洲人民、多年占领日本并且以敌视中国的政策强加在日本人民身上等种种行径而引起的。
