Chapter Five
    Matsuyama Airport is most desolate, welcoming and seeing off two hundred people coming and going. Wearing a smile like attending a great funeral, I am more desolate than the airport. Across the shore, only the sound of cannons booming, head-on blows, and pursued from behind. Daring not utter a sound, a tortoise shrinking into an iron cage. Hurriedly fleeing to Naha City, only to be besieged by a hundred thousand people. Shouting for the plague god to get back, I had to rush to escape for my life. Ten days ago, Hagerty, relied on helicopters to escape. This experience saved me, at least I had some success in going first. MacArthur is most hateful, he completely misjudged the situation. Having been given the cold shoulder in Japan, I was almost imprisoned on the Ryukyu Islands. It seems my evil deeds have reached their limit, I am jumping into a fire pit with my eyes open. The wolf's head breaks through the sheepskin, only crows come to welcome me.

Chapter Six
    Dulles, ten years ago, planned to occupy all of Korea. Ten years later, I came again, and the Korean people are furious. Not daring to walk on the main streets, I crept through small alleys, revealing the true nature of a robber. The wind howls, and every blade of grass seems like a soldier, only seeing police batons waving before my eyes. The plague god has lost his soul, and the whole street, the whole city seems like a funeral procession. Thirteen people were injured by cars, and this was presented as a welcome. The car windows were smashed, I almost became Syngman Rhee. The press secretary, Hagerty, blatantly spread lies with his eyes open. What's the use of deceiving oneself? The paper tiger is full of holes. As you sow, so shall you reap, yet you still want to daydream! Fortunately, I was able to return to Hawaii, my soul uneasy like a corpse. The image of American imperialism is me, and my image is American imperialism.

    艾森豪威尔独白
    郭沫若
  第五章松山机场最凄凉，迎送二百人来往。装着笑脸大出丧，我比机场更凄凉。隔岸但闻大炮轰，迎头痛击追尾送。不敢出头哼一声，乌龟缩进铁牢笼。匆匆逃到那霸城，又被十万人围困。高喊瘟神滚回去，只好提前忙逃命。十日之前哈格蒂，直升逃难靠飞机。这个经验救了我，先行总算有成绩。麦克阿塞最可恼，情况完全估错了。既吃日本闭门羹，几乎囚在琉球岛。看来恶贯已满盈，自己睁眼跳火坑。狼头碰破羊皮烂，但见乌鸦来欢迎。
  第六章杜勒斯在十年前，策划占领全朝鲜。十年之后我又来，朝鲜人民怒冲天。大街不走走小巷，强盗行径露本相。风声鹤唳草木兵，但见警棍眼前晃。瘟神已经失了魂，满街满市看出殡。撞伤群众十三位，示众说成受欢迎。汽车玻璃被打烂，险些成了李承晚。新闻秘书哈格蒂，睁着眼睛瞎宣传。欺骗自己有何用？纸虎浑身都是洞。种豆得豆理当然，还想再做白日梦！幸能回到夏威夷，惊魂难定如死尸。美帝形象就是我，我的形象是美帝。
