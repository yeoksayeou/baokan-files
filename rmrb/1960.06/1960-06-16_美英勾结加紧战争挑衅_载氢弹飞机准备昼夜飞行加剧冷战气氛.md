    Xinhua News Agency, London, June 14th: British newspapers here report that the United States and Britain are jointly formulating a plan for bombers carrying hydrogen bombs to "patrol" the world around the clock.

    This plan was reported by the "News Chronicle" on the 13th. The plan stipulates that two hundred British bombers and one thousand five hundred American aircraft carrying hydrogen bombs will fly non-stop around the globe from base to base.

    This is another step by Britain to follow the United States in creating tension and war hysteria after British Prime Minister Macmillan supported US President Eisenhower in sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference.

    According to the "News Chronicle," "Whether in flight or temporarily stationed at bases in Britain or ten thousand miles away, these aircraft are ready to attack their chosen targets at any time."

    The newspaper said, "These aircraft will carry nuclear weapons—first hydrogen bombs, then Blue Steel missiles with a range of 300 miles, and finally Lightning missiles with a range of 1,000 miles."

    The newspaper wrote: "This plan is the foundation of Defense Minister Watkinson's new policy, which stipulates maximum cooperation between British bombers and the US Strategic Air Command...

    "The Air Force has begun training flight personnel for long-range bombers. In addition, flight personnel have been sent to the Far East and Commonwealth countries to familiarize themselves with airports there."

    According to other reports in the British press, hydrogen bomb-carrying bombers will be stationed in the British colonies of Kenya, Cyprus, and Singapore.

    The "Daily Herald" wrote that the implementation of this plan "requires an additional allocation of 100 million pounds." The newspaper believes that this plan, politically speaking, is a step from the "Cold War" to a hot war.

    The "Daily Worker" reported today that Eisenhower and Macmillan agreed on the outline of a plan during their Camp David talks in March this year to have British bombers join the US nuclear air fleet in 24-hour airborne patrols. The "Daily Worker" pointed out that British Defense Minister Harold Watkinson raised this plan again during his visit to Washington last week.

    James Gardner, secretary of the British Peace Committee, said that this Anglo-American plan is a provocative action and a crazy act against peace-loving people all over the world. He said that efforts must be made everywhere in Britain to stop these flights and abolish all hydrogen bomb bases.

### 美英勾结加紧战争挑衅  载氢弹飞机准备昼夜飞行加剧冷战气氛

    美英勾结加紧战争挑衅
    载氢弹飞机准备昼夜飞行加剧冷战气氛
    新华社伦敦14日电　此间英国报纸报道，美英两国正在联合制定由载有氢弹的轰炸机昼夜二十四小时在全世界“巡逻”的计划。
    这项计划是“新闻纪事报”在13日报道的。这项计划规定：二百架英国轰炸机和一千五百架携带氢弹的美国飞机不停地从这个基地到那个基地围绕地球飞行。
    在英国首相麦克米伦支持美国总统艾森豪威尔破坏四国政府首脑会议后，这是英国追随美国制造紧张局势和战争歇斯底里的又一步骤。
    据“新闻纪事报”说：“不论在飞行中，还是临时停在英国或一万英里以外的基地上，这些飞机都随时准备着袭击它选中的目标”。
    报纸说，“这些飞机将携带核武器——首先是氢弹，其次是三百英里射程的蓝钢飞弹，最后是一千英里射程的闪电导弹”。
    报纸写道：“这个计划是国防大臣沃金森新政策的基础，它规定在英国轰炸机和美国战略空军之间进行最大限度的合作……
    “空军已经开始训练远程轰炸机的飞行人员。此外，飞行人员已经派往远东和英联邦国家，以便在那里熟悉机场。”
    据英国报纸的另一些报道说，携带氢弹的轰炸机将驻扎在英国的殖民地怯尼亚、塞浦路斯和新加坡。
    “每日先驱报”写道，实现这项计划，“还需要增加一亿英镑的拨款”。这家报纸认为，这项计划，在政治方面来说，是一个从“冷战”到热战的步骤。
    “工人日报”今天报道，艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦在今年3月的戴维营会谈中，同意让英国轰炸机同美国的核航空队一起在空中进行二十四小时巡逻的计划大纲。“工人日报”指出，英国国防大臣哈罗德·沃金森上星期在访问华盛顿时再次提出这项计划。
    英国和平委员会书记詹姆斯·加德纳说，这项英美计划是挑衅行动，是反对全世界爱好和平人民的疯狂行动。他说，英国各地必须亟尽努力来制止这种飞行和废除一切氢弹基地。
