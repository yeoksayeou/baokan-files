    Ode to the "People of the Great Northern Wilderness"
    Li Chao
    The Mudanjiang Reclamation Bureau Drama Troupe of the Ministry of Agricultural Reclamation, hailing from the Great Northern Wilderness, recently performed "People of the Great Northern Wilderness" on the stage of the people's capital. This play reflects the heroic deeds of the People's Liberation Army veterans who, under the leadership of the Party, overcame the ice and snow, and the swampy marshes, to develop Swan Goose Island in our country's desolate frontier region, the Great Northern Wilderness.
    Although the play depicts people reclaiming land and farming, and how they overcame the obstacles of the "Big Soy Sauce Jar" (swamp), and how to operate tractors in the low-lying swamps, etc., the authors, having lived in this fiery struggle for a long time, are able to bring the life of the Great Northern Wilderness to the audience in vivid and distinct dramatic artistic images.
    In the severe winter of thirty degrees below zero Celsius, Gao Jianmin, the secretary of the farm's Party committee, led the tractor drivers to the vicinity of Swan Goose Island. In order to introduce this precious island, and to more organically connect some of the characters in the play, the authors arranged a beautiful and moving story: The son of the old hunter Huang Zhiqing, who lived in the River God Temple, had shared life and death with Gao Jianmin twenty years ago, and Gao Jianmin, in the name of a Communist Party member, saved Huang Zhiqing's granddaughter, who was in his arms, and buried his comrade-in-arms—Huang Zhiqing's son. This plot not only makes the emotions of the characters like fish and water, but also more deeply and developmentally depicts the heroic image of Gao Jianmin, this Communist Party member; at the same time, it historically shows that although the Japanese warlords were ferocious, they failed to conquer this rich isolated island, while the invincible soldiers cultivated by our Party launched a struggle against nature here, demanding grain from the wilderness.
    The authors' writing about entering the island and reclaiming the land, and fighting against the difficulties that nature gives to people, is depicted through the struggle between two different ideological methods of dealing with objective things and understanding nature. The script firmly grasps this clue and launches a struggle against the empiricists and class dissidents, writing out a profound theme. Just as at the moment when the tractor drove into Swan Goose Island, it happened to coincide with the thawing and opening of the "soy sauce jar," which deeply mired the vehicle in the mud. Deputy Director Ji, a right-leaning empiricist, advocated retreating and using a winch to drag the tractor back, while Secretary Gao, in accordance with the Party's instructions and the demands of the masses, resolutely overcame the difficulties, encouraged the masses, and tried to drag this land reclamation machine into the desolate island. In this simple plot of dragging to that place and how to lead the masses, the script vividly describes Secretary Gao's Party spirit and leadership skills; on the one hand, he united with and struggled with Deputy Director Ji's good and rich experience, and on the other hand, he resolutely directed the cadres to dive and hang the steel edges of the traction. Because he grasped the heroic character of the group leader, Old Che, he used a method of provocation, deliberately not assigning him the most difficult work, but assigning him the task of picking firewood and cooking, and Old Che, as expected, while holding back a belly full of energy, led two female comrades, Yanzi and Xiao Liu, who were also willing to take on the most arduous work, to pick firewood, demonstrating a high degree of organization and a lovely heroic character. Therefore, when Old Che heard that he was going to carry the 180-jin winch seat, he took on this glorious task like a dragon and a tiger. This plot not only shows the masses' high morale, soaring energy, and carrying forward the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army, but also depicts Gao Secretary and Old Che in detail, showing the noble qualities of this group of "People of the Great Northern Wilderness." The occasions for shaping this secretary are not limited to this. The play depicts his calmness, composure, and decisive command in the face of many difficulties; in front of the masses, he is so kind, amiable, and respectable, and so full of strength, and in the midst of ideological struggle, he is so firm, so sharp, so persuasive, and so enthusiastic that we are convinced that this twenty-year Communist Party member is a veteran cadre who has been tempered and refined under the Party's cultivation and education.
    In terms of character shaping, the play also prominently portrays Huang Zhiqing's granddaughter, Yanzi. This young girl, who spends all day with her grandfather in the wilderness, hunting and shooting, has developed a rough, forthright, innocent, and brave character. We not only see her ideological awareness cultivated from labor through her consistent actions, and find the changes in her growth and development, but we can also feel her simple and sincere working people's feelings from her behavior in dealing with people, especially the relationship between her and her grandfather, who are dependent on each other. But when this reclamation team is about to be transferred to Qinghai, the old grandfather resolutely asks the leader to call this only relative who has never left his side to work in the place where the motherland needs him most. When Secretary Gao puts a big red flower on Yanzi, the old grandfather excitedly says, "Silly girl, hurry up and stand in line!" Then he wiped away the excited tears, feeling that it was a great honor and comfort for his granddaughter to be able to contribute to the construction of the motherland. Their mutually satisfied smiles left us with a deep impression.
    In addition, characters such as the tractor drivers Jiang Zhiren and You Tong, and the university intern Liu Xuejun are all vividly written, summarizing the heroic spirit and indomitable will of the young generation of young men and women.
    The script not only shapes various types of new heroic characters, but also successfully portrays the right-leaning conservative empiricist Ji Qingshan who is criticized. This deputy director's experience in running a farm for several years has blocked his way forward. He is satisfied with his achievements and is no longer interested in new things. He firmly believes in his own understanding and judgment. He sincerely wants to do the work more reliably, but a person with subjectivist thinking cannot recognize the true meaning of things, cannot make correct judgments, and he is so confident in his own judgments. As described in the play: Because this reclamation team encountered low-lying muddy areas on Swan Goose Island, and the tractor could no longer exert its power, the cultivation speed was sharply reduced. In order not to miss the farming season for planting soybeans, he mobilized all the manpower to manually plant soybeans with bean shovels, giving up the excavation of drainage ditches and the experiment of reforming the tractor's adaptability. He engaged in a "serious and earnest" debate with Secretary Gao. He was worried that Secretary Gao would pay attention to digging ditches and devoting himself to experiments, disregarding the "actual situation" and missing the farming season, so he believed that it was better to plant less than not to plant at all. But he didn't know that all the labor force spending a few days with bean shovels was not as efficient as a tractor for a day, so when he assigned someone to take a bean shovel to plant beans, it caused the audience to burst into laughter, so much so that when he picked up a bean shovel, the audience couldn't help but laugh. This effect shows that the audience fully understood the character's thinking portrayed in the play and recognized how ridiculous and alarming this kind of thinking is.
    As for the image of Hu Yunpeng, who came from a landlord family, it is also very vivid. His words, deeds, and actions all permeate the revelation of his class essence. But it should also be pointed out that we require the characters in the play to have both the commonality of the class and the personality and characteristics of each individual at each period in expressing class character. The portrayal of this character in the play is not yet clear enough in this regard. Taking several contracted tractor drivers as an example, sometimes we cannot distinguish them from their language, modeling, clothing, etc. whether they are Zhang San or Li Si.
    We feel that the structure of this play can be more precise and complete, so that the beginning and end can echo more; so that the beautiful story arranged at the beginning can give the audience more imagination, so that the grave of Yanzi's father, Secretary Gao's comrade-in-arms, buried under the birch tree, can promote the development of dramatic action and bring historical encouragement and lessons to Yanzi the soldier, just like in the previous scene. Also, the description of the past of the Great Northern Wilderness in the play and the portrayal of the heroic sons and daughters who have transformed its appearance with their own hands under the leadership of the Party, as well as the beautiful prospects of this vast wilderness can be more clearly contrasted. We believe that after further processing, the heroic image of the "People of the Great Northern Wilderness" will be more gloriously established on the stage.

    颂“北大荒人”
    李超
    来自北大荒的农垦部牡丹江农垦局话剧团，最近在人民首都的舞台上演出了《北大荒人》。这出戏反映了我们祖国人烟荒芜的边远地区北大荒，在党的领导下，中国人民解放军转业官兵战胜了冰天雪地，沼泽泥塘，开发雁窝岛的英雄事迹。
    戏虽然是描写人们开荒种地，如何克服了“大酱缸”的险阻，如何使拖拉机在低洼的沼泽里操作等等的事迹。但是，由于作者们长期生活在这火热的斗争中，所以他们能把北大荒的生活以生动鲜明的戏剧艺术形象带给观众。
    在摄氏零下三十度的严冬，农场党委书记高建民带领着拖拉机手们来到了雁窝岛附近。作者们为了介绍这个宝岛，为了把一些剧中人更有机地联系在一起，安排了一个美丽动人的故事：住在河神庙里的老猎民黄志清的儿子在二十年前就同高建民共过生死患难，而且高建民以共产党员的名义救了黄志清怀抱的孙女，埋葬了他的战友——黄志清的儿子。这个情节不但使剧中人的情感鱼水相投，也更深刻地、发展地描写了高建民这个共产党员的英雄形象；同时历史地写出了日本军阀虽然凶恶但没能征服这个富饶的孤岛，而我们党培养出的战无不胜的战士们，却在这里向大自然展开了斗争，向荒野要来了粮食。
    作者们写进岛和开荒，对自然界给予人们的困难作斗争的情节，是通过两种不同的对待客观事物、认识自然的思想方法的斗争来描写的。剧本牢牢地抓住这一线索对经验主义者、对阶级异己分子展开了斗争。写出了深刻的主题。正如在拖拉机开进雁窝岛的时刻，恰逢“酱缸”解冻、开化，把机车深陷在泥潭里。右倾的经验主义者纪副场长就主张撤退，用绞盘机把拖拉机拖回去，而高书记却按照党的指示、群众的要求，坚决克服困难鼓舞群众，设法把这开荒的机器拖进荒岛。在这拖向那里，如何领导群众的简单情节里，剧本却有声有色地描写出高书记的党性和领导工作的才能；他一方面有团结有斗争地注意了纪副场长好的丰富经验，一方面坚决地指挥着干部们潜水挂牵引的钢缘。由于他掌握了组长老车的英雄性格，以激将的方法，偏偏不分配他最艰难的工作，使他担当捡柴烧饭的活计，而老车果然一边憋满一肚子劲，一边又带领着和他一样愿意担当最艰苦工作的两位女同志——燕子和小刘去捡柴，表现了高度的组织性和可爱的英勇性格。所以当老车听到要他去扛一百八十斤重的绞盘机座的时候，便生龙活虎般地承担了这项光荣任务。这一情节的描写不但写出了群众斗志昂扬，干劲冲天，发挥了人民解放军的光荣传统，也对高书记和老车作了细致的刻划，表现了这群“北大荒人”的高贵品质。塑造这位书记的场合还不止于此，剧中在很多困难面前描绘了他的冷静、沉着，指挥若定；在群众的面前他是那么和蔼可亲、可敬，又那么富有力量，而在思想斗争的当儿他又表现得那么坚定，那么尖锐，那么有说服力和热情，使我们信服这位二十年的共产党员是个在党的培养教育下，得到千锤百炼的老干部。
    在人物塑造上，剧中也突出地刻划了黄志清的孙女燕子。这个年轻的姑娘，她整天和老爷爷出没荒野丛林行围射猎，形成了那种粗犷爽朗而又天真勇敢的性格。我们不但通过她的贯串动作看到她从劳动中锻炼出来的思想觉悟，找到她成长发展的变化，我们也可以从她待人接物的行为中感到她那纯朴、真挚的劳动人民感情，特别是她和爷爷相依为命的关系写得入情入理。但是当这支垦荒的队伍将要远调青海的时候，老爷爷却坚决要求领导叫这个从未离开过身边的唯一亲人，到祖国最需要的地方去工作。等高书记给燕子带上大红花的时候，老爷爷激动地说：“傻丫头，还不快去站队！”然后他擦着兴奋的热泪，感到孙女儿能为祖国建设出点力真是莫大的光荣与安慰。他们爷俩相视着满意的微笑，留给我们多么深刻的印象。
    此外，如拖拉机手江志仁、尤通和大学实习生刘学军等人物都写得很生动，概括了年青一代的小伙子和姑娘们的英雄气概和不畏艰难的意志。
    剧本不但塑造了各个类型的新英雄人物，也成功地描绘了被批判的右倾保守的经验主义者纪庆山。这位副场长被他办几年农场的经验堵塞了前进的道路，他满足于自己的成绩，对新事物已经不再感兴趣，而自己坚信着自己的认识和判断，他是忠心耿耿地想把工作更有把握的作好，但有主观主义思想的人恰恰不能认识事物的真谛，不能作出正确的判断，而他对自己的判断却是那么自信。正如剧中所描写的：由于这支开荒队伍在雁窝岛遇到了低洼泥泞地带，拖拉机不能再发挥它的威力，耕垦速度锐减，为了不误农时播种大豆，他就动员所有的人力用豆铲人工点种大豆，放弃了开凿排水沟，改革拖拉机适应性能的试验。他是那么“严肃认真”地和高书记展开了辩论。他耽心高书记注意挖渠投身试验不顾“实际”，误了农时，因此他认为宁肯少种一点也比种不上强。可是他不知道，全部劳动力拿豆铲忙几天也顶不上一台拖拉机一天的效率，所以当他每分配一个人拿豆铲去种豆的时候，就引起观众的哄笑，以至等他一拿起豆铲观众就忍不住发笑。这个效果说明了观众完全领会了剧中所刻划的人物思想，认识了这种思想是多么可笑，多么值得警惕。
    至于那地主家庭出身的胡云鹏的形象也非常生动。他的一言一行，一举一动都渗透着阶级本质的流露。但是也应该指出，我们要求剧中的人物既有阶级的共性，也要有各个人各个时期表现阶级性的个性，特性。剧中对这个人物的描写在这方面也还不够鲜明。以几个包车组的拖拉机手来说，有时也使我们不能从他们的语言、造型、服饰等方面分别出是张三或李四来。
    我们觉得，这出戏的结构还可以更精密完整一些，使首尾能更多的呼应；使前边所布置的美丽故事，能够延续给观众更多的想像，使埋葬在白桦树下的燕子的父亲、高书记的战友的坟墓，如像在前场戏里一样的能推动戏剧动作发展，给燕子战士带来历史的鼓舞和教训。又如剧中对北大荒过去的描写和经过党领导下的英雄儿女们双手改造面貌后的描画，以及这幅宽广的原野的美丽远景还可以作更鲜明的对比。我们相信，经过进一步的加工，将会使“北大荒人”的英雄形象更光辉地树立在戏剧舞台上。
