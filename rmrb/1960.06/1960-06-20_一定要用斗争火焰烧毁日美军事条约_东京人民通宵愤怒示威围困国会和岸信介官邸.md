Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 19th: A large-scale demonstration by the people of Tokyo protesting the Kishi Nobusuke group's illegal "natural enactment" of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" which sells out the interests of the Japanese nation and demanding the overthrow of the Kishi cabinet, began last night and continued until this morning.

According to the final statistics of the National Council Against Revision of the "Security Treaty," approximately 400,000 people participated in the demonstration on June 18th, far exceeding the planned mobilization of 270,000. The Diet, the Prime Minister's official residence, the Metropolitan Police Department, and the U.S. Embassy all became seas of angry crowds and red flags. The Ginza and Shibuya districts of Tokyo were completely occupied by the demonstration. From last night, 20,000 students surrounded the Diet Building, protesting throughout the night against the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet's forceful enactment of the new "Security Treaty" which came into "natural effect" at midnight on the morning of June 19th. At the same time, tens of thousands of workers and government employees, after holding demonstrations, returned to the front of the Diet to participate in the protests. Prominent figures in the Japanese cultural world, such as Kiyoshi Aono, Kenzo Nakajima, and professors from Hitotsubashi University and other universities, also participated in the all-night demonstration. Late at night, fascist thugs made several provocations against the demonstrators, but their conspiracy failed in the face of the human wall formed by approximately 30,000 people with arms linked.

The angry masses besieged Kishi Nobusuke's official residence so tightly that he was unable to return home and had to spend the night there. Slogans such as "Down with the Kishi Cabinet!", "Dissolve the Diet!", and "Smash the Security Treaty!" reverberated throughout the Tokyo night sky. One demonstration of over 100,000 people marched through downtown Tokyo to demonstrate in front of the Metropolitan Police Department.

Another contingent marched in a mighty stream toward the U.S. Embassy in Japan to demonstrate against the representative organ of the American master on whom the Kishi Nobusuke group relies.

As each demonstration passed through the streets, residents standing on both sides of the road applauded the demonstrators, and the demonstrators waved back at them.

Around the Diet, the Prime Minister's official residence, and the Metropolitan Police Department, the demonstrating masses finally sat on the ground, continuing their struggle until dawn. At daybreak, the demonstrators sitting on the ground reorganized and marched around the Diet. At this time, the Socialist Party delegation, led by Socialist Party Chairman Inejiro Asanuma, and Communist Party members of parliament Masao Iwama, Goro Suto, and others applauded the demonstrators in front of the Diet.

    一定要用斗争火焰烧毁日美军事条约
    东京人民通宵愤怒示威围困国会和岸信介官邸
    据新华社19日讯　东京消息：抗议岸信介集团非法使出卖日本民族利益的新日美“安全条约”“自然成立”和打倒岸内阁的东京人民大示威，从昨夜开始举行，一直继续到今天上午。
    据阻止修改“安全条约”国民会议最后统计，参加18日大示威的人数约达四十万人，远远超过了计划动员的二十七万人。国会、首相官邸、警视厅以及美国大使馆等地方，都变成了愤怒的人群和红旗的海洋。东京闹区的银座和澁谷完全为示威队伍所占据。二万名学生从昨天晚上起就把国会大厦包围起来，通宵抗议岸信介内阁强使新“安全条约”在19日上午零时“自然成立”。同时，几万名工人和政府职员在举行了示威游行后，回到国会前面参加了抗议活动。日本文化界著名人士青野季吉、中岛健藏和一桥大学等各大学的教授们也参加了通宵示威。深夜，法西斯匪徒曾经几次向示威队伍进行挑衅，但是他们的阴谋在由约三万名群众臂挽臂筑成的长城前面无法得逞。
    愤怒的群众把岸信介官邸包围得水泄不通，他们迫使岸信介回不了家，只好在官邸过夜。“打倒岸内阁！”、“解散国会！”、“粉碎安全条约！”等口号震荡在整个东京的夜空。有一支约十万多人的示威队伍穿过了东京闹市，到警视厅门前示威。
    另一支队伍，则浩浩荡荡走向美国驻日本大使馆，向这个岸信介集团所投靠的美国主子的代表机关示威。
    当每支示威队伍穿过街道时，站在路两旁的居民都向示威群众鼓掌；示威群众也向他们招手。
    在国会、首相官邸和警视厅周围，示威的群众最后席地而坐，一直斗争到拂晓。破晓时刻，席地而坐的示威群众又整队在国会周围举行游行。这时，以社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎为首的社会党议员团和共产党议员岩间正男、须藤五郎等在国会前面鼓掌欢迎示威队伍。
