Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 30th. The latest issue of the Indian weekly "New Age" published an editorial entitled "Expose the Aggressors," expressing firm support for the Soviet Union's solemn stance in exposing the aggressive conspiracies of the American imperialists.

The editorial pointed out, "The leaders of the Chinese Communist Party and the government completely agree with and strongly support this extremely sound and wise rational concept, and have launched an unprecedented mass movement to clarify the situation, raise everyone's vigilance, warn the American imperialists, and fully support the Soviet position. People are also taking action all over the world. American imperialists are unprecedentedly isolated."

The editorial said, "Many editorials and commentaries in the Indian press have shown the correct position, sharply criticizing the provocative conspiracies of the United States, but it is regrettable that the Indian government has always remained completely silent. The Prime Minister (Nehru)'s speeches in Cairo and Ankara avoided mentioning anything other than expressing 'regret' for the failure of the summit. He neither condemned the U-2 aircraft attacks nor the official position of the United States, which is that it believes it has the right to violate the sovereignty of other countries as it pleases."

The editorial said that this avoidance of condemning the aggressors will definitely be fully utilized by those in the United States who are openly advocating aggression and are already in trouble. People must feel saddened by this bizarre silence.

The editorial said, "Unfortunately, in addition to this harmful attitude of non-committal, an anti-China movement has been re-ignited. It is extremely regrettable that figures such as Pant, a major cabinet minister and important leader of the Congress Party, are taking the lead in this regard. Very reactionary people among newspaper editors have tried their best to respond to Pant's actions, and have even gone further."

The editorial said, "According to Pant's logic, the Chinese people's anger at the United States for undermining the summit means that they are happy about the failure of the summit! Pant also argued in the same tone that the breakdown of the summit increases the danger to India, a danger that comes not from American imperialism, which has bases in Pakistan, but from China!" The editorial said that, in fact, India, China, the entire Asia, and the whole world are threatened by the actual possibility that the United States will carry out new provocations in a desperate attempt to oppose peaceful coexistence.

The editorial pointed out, "Pant and others are not helping the cause of world peace, nor are they helping our country's national interests. Using the failure of the summit to launch another offensive of hostility towards China will unimaginably affect our international status, dangerously disarm and confuse our people, and damage our country and its future."

The editorial pointed out, "(Indian) national interests demand exactly the opposite. The people must demand that the Indian government stop hesitating, abandon its silence, unambiguously point out the aggressor, and resolutely condemn him. The people must ensure that nothing that harms the international atmosphere happens, and that the government firmly advances along the path of negotiation to resolve our disputes with China."

The editorial said that all peace-loving people and countries, all those who cherish their national sovereignty, will unite to defeat the US imperialist offensive against easing international tensions. In this crucial struggle, India cannot stand aside; it must speak and act together with everyone for the victory of peace and against the deadly enemies of peace.

    印度“新世纪”周报支持苏联揭露美国侵略的立场
    谴责潘特掀起反华运动
    指出尼赫鲁避不谴责美国的做法有利于侵略者
    新华社新德里30日电　最新一期印度“新世纪”周报发表的题为“揭露侵略者”的社论，表示坚决支持苏联的揭露美帝国主义者的侵略阴谋的严正立场。
    社论指出，“中国共产党和政府领导人完全同意并且大力支持这种极其健全和明智的理性概念，发起了空前的群众运动，来阐明形势，引起大家的警惕，警告美帝国主义者，并且完全支持苏联的立场。在世界各地，人民也行动起来了。美帝国主义者空前孤立。”
    社论说，“印度报刊有许多社论和评论表明了正确的立场，尖锐地抨击了美国的挑衅性阴谋，但是令人遗憾的是，印度政府始终完全保持缄默。总理（尼赫鲁）在开罗和安卡拉发表的谈话，除了对最高级会议的失败表示‘遗憾’以外，也避而不谈。他既没有谴责U—2型飞机的袭击，也没有谴责美国的官方立场，而美国官方的立场是认为自己有权为所欲为地侵犯别国的主权的。”
    社论说，这种避不谴责侵略者的做法，一定会被已陷入困境的在美国露骨地主张侵略的人所充分利用。人们对这种离奇的缄默一定会感到痛心。
    社论说，“不幸的是，除了这种本身有害的不加可否的态度之外，接着又重新掀起了反华运动。像主要的内阁部长、国大党重要领袖潘特这样的人物，竟然在这方面起带头作用，实在是极其令人遗憾的事情。报界编辑中很反动的人士尽力地响应了潘特的做法，而且变本加厉。”
    社论说，“按照潘特的逻辑，中国人民对美国破坏了最高级会议感到愤怒，意味着他们对最高级会议的失败感到高兴！潘特还以同样的调子争辩，最高级会议的破裂，增加了对印度的危险，这种危险不是来自在巴基斯坦设有基地的美帝国主义，而是来自中国！”社论说，事实上，印度、中国、整个亚洲和全世界都由于美国为了拼命反对和平共处而进行新的挑衅这种实际可能性而受到威胁。
    社论指出，“潘特等人既无助于世界和平事业，也无助于我国的民族利益。利用最高级会议开不成来发动另一次仇视中国的攻势，将不堪设想地影响我们的国际地位，危险地解除我国人民的武装和迷惑他们；并且损害我国和它的前途。”
    社论指出，“（印度）民族利益要求的是恰恰相反。人民必须要求印度政府停止犹豫，抛弃缄默，毫不含糊地指明侵略者，并且断然地谴责他。人民必须做到：任何损害国际气氛的事情不发生，而政府坚定地沿着谈判的道路前进，以解决我们同中国的争议。”
    社论说，一切爱好和平的人民和国家，一切珍视自己国家主权的人们将团结起来挫败美帝国主义反对缓和国际紧张局势的攻势。这个至关重要的斗争中，印度不能站在旁边，它必须为和平的胜利以及反对和平的死敌而同大家一起说话和行动。
