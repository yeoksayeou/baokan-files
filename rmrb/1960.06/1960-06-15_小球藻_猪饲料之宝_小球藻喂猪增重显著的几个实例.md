Chlorella - A Treasure for Pig Feed
Several Examples of Significant Weight Gain in Pigs Fed with Chlorella

    The Baise County Food and Sundries Store in Guangxi used concentrated Chlorella liquid to feed pigs, and each pig gained 1.4 jin of fat per day, which is 1 jin more than when Chlorella was not fed; moreover, the pigs had smooth hair and a ruddy skin after eating Chlorella. (Xu Yang, Baise Prefectural Commercial Bureau of Guangxi)

    In Linru County, Henan, the Guozhuang Brigade pig farm of the Chengguan Commune fed nine fattening pigs with the same feed. Six of them were fed an additional three jin of concentrated Chlorella liquid per head per day. After half a month, each pig gained an average of 17.2 jin, while the other three pigs that were not fed Chlorella gained an average of only 9 jin per head.

    The Cheng Gui Brigade pig farm of this commune fed twenty-one pigs in the same way. Thirteen of them were fed an additional three qian of Chlorella dried powder per head per day (sixty jin of concentrated liquid can be dried into one jin of powder). After fourteen days, each pig gained an average of 29 jin; while the pigs that were not fed Chlorella dried powder gained an average of only 11.2 jin per head per day.

    The experience of this commune in feeding pigs with Chlorella also proves that the pigs' appetite generally increases, the frequency of urination and defecation increases, and they like to sleep, thus accelerating fattening; pigs suffering from anemia can quickly recover to health after eating Chlorella. (Linru Internship Group of the Luoyang Prefectural Committee Communications Training Class of the Chinese Communist Party)

    The Liuxia Commune in Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, conducted a pig feeding experiment with Chlorella: with the same basic feed, pigs fed an additional three jin of concentrated Chlorella liquid per day gained an average of more than half a jin of meat per head per day than pigs that only ate feed.

    After adding Chlorella to the feed of the three hundred and thirty-seven pigs in the pig farm of this commune, the milk production of sows increased, and the piglets grew well. After one litter of nine piglets was weaned at two months, the average weight of each piglet reached 19 jin, an increase of 25% compared to weaned piglets that were not fed Chlorella.

    小球藻  猪饲料之宝
    小球藻喂猪增重显著的几个实例
    广西百色县食品杂货商店用小球藻浓缩液喂猪，每头每天长膘一斤四两，比不喂小球藻时每天多增重一斤；而且吃小球藻后毛泽光滑，皮色红润。（广西百色专署商业局许扬）
    河南临汝县城关公社郭庄大队养猪场用同样饲料喂了九头肥猪，其中六头每天每头加喂三斤小球藻浓缩液，半个月后，每头猪平均增重十七点二斤，另三头未加喂小球藻的每头平均只增重九斤。
    这个公社的程桂大队养猪场，用同样办法喂了二十一头猪，其中有十三头猪每天每头加喂小球藻干粉（六十斤浓缩液可以晒干粉一斤）三钱，十四天后，每头猪平均增重二十九斤；而未加喂小球藻干粉的猪每头每天平均只增重十一点二斤。
    这个公社用小球藻喂猪的经验还证明：猪的食量普遍增加，大小便次数增多，爱睡觉，因此增膘加快；患贫血症的猪食用小球藻很快就能恢复健康。（中共洛阳地委通讯训练班临汝实习小组）
    浙江杭州市留下公社用小球藻喂猪试验：基础饲料相同，每天加喂三斤浓缩液小球藻的猪，比光吃饲料的猪平均每头每天多长肉半斤多。
    这个公社养猪场的三百三十七头猪加喂小球藻后，母猪奶水加多，仔猪生长良好。有一窝九头仔猪双满月断奶后，平均每头体重达十九斤，比没有喂小球藻的断奶猪体重增加25％。（留下公社畜牧办公室谢有溪）
