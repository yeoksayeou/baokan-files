This dispatch from Tianjin on the 16th: The workers of Sifangtai Iron Mine in Xuanhua District, Zhangjiakou, focusing on key aspects of production, earnestly studied and promoted advanced experiences, accelerated the technological transformation of the mine, and increased ore production. From January to May of this year, they produced more than 92,400 tons of ore, an increase of 74.8% compared to the same period last year. The average work efficiency of the entire mine increased by 71.12% compared to last year, the ore grade reached 54.5%, the cost decreased by 30.27% compared to last year, and the number of personnel was reduced by more than 25% compared to the beginning of the year.

Sifangtai Iron Mine was a small mine "dug out" by members of agricultural cooperatives with picks and shovels during the Great Leap Forward for steel production in 1958. After this mine shifted from open-pit to underground mining in the second half of last year, production conditions became very difficult: tunnels were narrow, transportation was congested, mining and tunneling were not separated, and production relied entirely on manual labor, making it difficult to maintain the original production level. However, the more than twenty small blast furnaces of the local iron factory, after renovation, had doubled their output, demanding a greater supply of ore. Under these circumstances, the mine's Party general branch promptly proposed the task of comprehensively transforming the mine with indigenous methods, calling on all employees to earnestly study and promote the advanced experiences of fraternal mines, creatively solve key production problems, and develop ore production. This call was immediately met with enthusiastic responses from the vast number of workers.

In the mass movement to promote advanced experiences, the mine formulated a plan to promote seventeen major advanced experiences in mining, tunneling, transportation, and other aspects. From the mine to the work areas and production teams, specialized management organizations were established to organize and concentrate the energy and wisdom of the vast number of workers on the most critical issues, quickly solving the problems of heavy manual labor and transportation in the mine's transformation. The entire mine's staff adopted the method of promoting large projects at the mine level, medium projects at the work area level, and small projects at the production team level, with everyone participating. They quickly promoted the advanced experiences created by fraternal mines, such as foot-operated drilling machines, high-altitude cableways, wooden chutes, and medicinal-bottle blasting methods, and proposed more than sixty improvement suggestions. In just three months, the entire mine learned, imitated, and created ninety-seven various machines, laid more than 2,700 meters of iron and wood transportation tracks, installed winches in the mine's inclined shafts, laid rails in the level tunnels, erected cableways on the mountains, and installed semi-automatic wooden chutes for loading, freeing all the transportation workers from carrying poles and baskets. Various types of drilling machines made by the workers themselves were also used in the main roadways, the working faces, and the bottom grooves of the mountains, freeing 80% of the mining and tunneling workers from heavy hammers and picks.

Through the mass technical transformation movement of the mine, the production outlook of Sifangtai Iron Mine has been completely renewed. The entire production process, from development and extraction to ore loading and transportation out of the mine, has basically achieved mechanization. The number of workers in the entire mine has been reduced from more than nine hundred at the beginning of the year to more than six hundred. The two hundred and forty workers who were freed up established a ore powder sintering plant, a construction team, a production exploration team, and supported other factories and mines. In terms of production, mining and tunneling have been separated, and specialized mining and tunneling teams have been established. Permanent roadways and transportation lines have been established in mining areas where resource conditions are available. Thanks to the tunneling and production exploration teams, production preparation work has been greatly strengthened, creating favorable conditions for the mine's regular mining and sustained leap forward.

    认真学习先进经验　用土办法实现机械化
    四方台铁矿大幅度增产
    本报天津16日电　张家口宣化区四方台铁矿职工，针对生产关键，认真学习和推广先进经验，加速矿山技术改造，提高了矿石生产。今年1至5月份，已生产矿石九万二千四百多吨，比去年同期增长74．8％；全矿平均工效比去年提高71．12％，矿石品位达到54．5％，成本比去年降低30．27％，人员比年初减少了25％以上。
    四方台铁矿是1958年大办钢铁时由农业社社员用洋镐、铁锨“刨”出来的小型矿山。这个矿于去年下半年由露天开采转入坑下开采后，生产条件十分困难：坑道狭窄、运输拥挤、采掘不分，生产全靠人工劳动，很难维持原有生产水平；而当地铁厂的二十多座小高炉，经过改造，产量成倍增长，要求供应更多的矿石。在这种情况下，矿党总支适时地提出了用土办法全面改造矿山的任务，号召全体职工，认真学习和推广兄弟矿山的先进经验，创造性地解决本矿生产关键，发展矿石生产。这一号召立即得到广大工人的热烈响应。
    在推广先进经验的群众运动中，这个矿制定了推广采掘、运输等方面十七项重大先进经验的规划，从矿到工区、生产队成立了专管机构，有组织地把广大工人的干劲和智慧集中到最关键的问题上来，迅速地解决了矿山改造中手工笨重劳动和运输问题。全矿职工采取矿上推广大项目、工区推广中项目、生产队推广小项目的办法，人人动手，很快地推广了兄弟矿山创造的脚踏打眼机、高空索道、木溜子、药壶爆破法等先进经验，而且提出了六十多条改进意见。短短三个月，全矿学习仿制和创制各种机器九十七台，铺设运输铁木轨道二千七百多米，使矿山斜井安上了绞车，平峒铺上了铁轨，高山架起了索道，装车安上了半自动木溜子，运输工人全部放下了扁担、抬筐；在主要巷道、掘进掌子面、上山底槽也都用上了工人自己制造的各式打眼机，80％的采掘工人放下了沉重的铁锤、洋镐。
    通过群众性的矿山技术改造运动，四方台铁矿生产面貌已焕然一新，整个生产过程，从开拓回采一直到矿石装运出矿已基本实现机械化。全矿工人由年初九百多名减少到六百多名，减下来的二百四十多名工人，建立了矿粉烧结厂、基建队、生产探矿队和支援了其它厂矿。生产上也由采掘不分，划分了采矿、掘进专业队伍。在资源条件具备的矿区已建立起永久性巷道和运输线路。由于有了掘进、生产探矿队，生产准备工作大大加强，给矿山正规开采、持续跃进创造了有利条件。（附图片）
