Zhao Pingtai and Baiguishan Reservoirs Release Water Early to Irrigate Land and Fight Drought

(Our report) The Zhao Pingtai and Baiguishan large reservoirs in the Xuchang area of Henan Province, and their irrigation canals, have released water ahead of schedule to join the fight against drought.

These two reservoirs currently hold 87 million cubic meters of water, which can alleviate the water shortage difficulties for 1.25 million mu of land along the Sha River in six counties, including Lushan, Pingdingshan City, Wuyang, Yancheng, and Shangshui. The sluice gates were opened on June 12th. The first to benefit were the six communes of Chengguan, Zongzhuang, Dongcun, and Malou in Lushan County. The 30,700 laborers organized in advance immediately went into the work of rush-irrigating and rush-planting.

Zhao Pingtai and Baiguishan are two large-scale projects in the Xuchang area for the fundamental control of the Sha River's water hazards.
