Xinhua News Agency, London, June 2nd - The Secretariat of the Communist Party of the United States issued a statement on May 26th. The title of the statement is: "The Summit Meeting Failed – What Now?"

The statement said: The failure of the Paris summit exposed the deep crisis of American foreign policy. The long-standing Cold War rhetoric, as well as the clamor for increased armaments and intensified persecution, cannot drown out the growing protests from many sides. The American people oppose policies that always lead us to more dangerous edges. The world unanimously condemns a policy under which the activities of the U-2 plane have failed and American prestige has fallen to an unprecedented low in modern history.

The statement said: The responsibility for the failure of the summit lies with the Cold War advocates in high positions. These people are in the Pentagon, the government, large companies with huge military contracts, the bi-partisan Congressional leadership, and the top labor leaders who are "partners" in the Cold War. They intensified the Cold War before the summit in order to stifle the summit. Their conspiracies to obstruct disarmament in Geneva, the forced increase in military appropriations, the Dulles-style ranting of Herter, Nixon, and Dillon, and the pre-planned AFL-CIO foreign policy meeting. These are all shameful actions of the "nationwide" promotion of the Cold War.

The statement said: The US President went to Paris not with the desire to negotiate the new status of Berlin, but with Adenauer's stubborn opposition to any change. Although promising progress had been made in Geneva on the abolition of nuclear tests, and it was generally expected that this would be guaranteed at the summit, the President announced that the United States would resume underground tests.

Although the President has emphasized that disarmament is a major issue, he used the summit to re-promote the "open skies" theory, making it clear that what he was pursuing was to supervise the armaments of other countries, rather than mutual supervision in universal disarmament. Instead of trying to find ways to ease international tensions, he defended the theory that led to the provocative flights of the U-2 aircraft.

The statement said: Even more shocking than the flight itself is the President's defense of the so-called theory used to justify this flight.

According to this theory, the U.S. government claims to have the unilateral right to fly arbitrarily in the airspace of any country, regardless of all international law.

Under similar pretexts, the United States, during previous and this administration, has formed war threats on the Jinmen and Matsu issues, invaded Lebanon, stationed one million soldiers in seventy countries, established two hundred and fifty bases around the world, overthrown the democratic government of Guatemala, and is now threatening to intervene in Cuba, sacrificing more than 40,000 Americans in a colonial war that killed one million Koreans to put its puppet tyrant Syngman Rhee, who has now been driven away by angry people, on the throne.

The statement said: The new theory of "open skies" is dangerously close to the madness of preventive war. This is a revival of the brinkmanship policy and its danger is even greater than that reached by Dulles when he engaged in this policy.

These are the real reasons for the collapse of the summit.

The statement also pointed out that the Soviet Union cannot be intimidated. This country has never been intimidated, not even by Hitler. This country is only willing to negotiate on equal terms, without being threatened from a position of strength.

The statement said: The collapse of the summit is not due to incompetence, clumsiness or any specific errors or flaws in government policy. It is due to the implementation of dangerous policies, actively implementing a completely wrong Cold War policy.

The statement said: We need national consensus to support a policy of ending the Cold War, engaging in honest negotiations with the Soviet Union to stop nuclear testing, abolishing nuclear weapons and all other weapons of terror, striving for complete and thorough disarmament, giving Berlin and the two Germanys a status that everyone can agree on, and allowing China to enjoy its deserved place in international conferences.

We don't need the "open skies" theory, we need the principles of non-interference, friendly cultural and scientific exchanges, and trade on a business basis.

The statement also said: We do not need a Cold War empire built on American weapons and dollars, ruled by Syngman Rhee, Chiang Kai-shek, and Trujillo.

The statement then spoke of how American officials should not complain about other countries' "closed societies" and should look at the situation in Washington. The statement pointed out, "In Washington, dozens of important administrative agencies are off-limits even to Congress under the pretext of military needs."

"Behind the scenes, big business leaders and military leaders who constantly rotate between large corporations and federal agencies arrange affairs among themselves. Under the pretext of military secrets, billions of dollars in arms contracts are negotiated in the Pentagon, with only a few of the most profitable monopolies participating."

The statement said: "Let those who claim to be uneasy about the danger of so-called raids tell the American people how they have cloaked science in the cloak of military secrecy, thus greatly damaging science itself and causing incalculable damage to the entire education system.

"Let them publicly acknowledge the principle of 'open house', under which the FBI and other police agencies have forcibly seized the right to violate people's secrets, and the post office has been given the illegal right to withhold letters and burn books it deems 'subversive'. Or let them explain how the 'raids' on law-abiding people summoned before the Un-American Activities Investigation Committee can be reconciled with the people's ideas about what a free and open society is, and the summons of this committee tramples on the basic rights of the Constitution."

The statement refuted the fallacy that the arms race and provocative "open skies" espionage activities are justified because they are necessary to "prevent surprise attacks." The statement asked: If this is indeed the case, then why is the Soviet Union, which is recognized as being superior in rockets and missiles, calling for a common agreement to abolish and destroy these weapons? How can the Soviet Union, as generally recognized, maintain the initiative in one peace movement after another? Have Soviet planes invaded our airspace to survey strategic and industrial targets for an offensive?

The statement said: The truth of the matter is that no one, no class, or group in the Soviet Union or any socialist country can benefit from war.

This is recognized by many high-ranking people in our country. On the eve of the summit, the U.S. Army issued an official report on a long-term research plan, which concluded that the Soviet Union would not theoretically or practically take the action of launching an offensive first and eliminating the West's "retaliatory capabilities."

The statement said: The way to stop people from being afraid of surprise attacks is to end the Cold War and negotiate a large-scale disarmament agreement, which is what the Soviet Union wants. But, time and again, when the Soviet Union accepted proposals put forward by the United States, making it possible to reach a preliminary agreement, Washington withdrew these proposals. From the very beginning – since the Baruch Plan in 1946 – U.S. negotiators have used the trick of obstructing disarmament agreements with the issue of supervision. The Soviet Union also insisted on supervision and inspection, but as a means of verifying and implementing disarmament agreements, while the supervision that the United States wanted was not for disarmament, but as a means of assessing relative strength in an arms race.

The statement called on the American people to remove the government that hinders the path to peace, and called on the people to defeat McCarthyism.

The statement also emphasized that "It must never be allowed to use the investigation into the U-2 aircraft's border crossing flight and the causes of the summit failure to whitewash all those responsible, regardless of which party these people belong to. Nor should they be allowed to avoid talking about the real central issue of the Cold War policy itself, or to obstruct a truly open debate on the policies needed for this country to survive in a peaceful world.

"The Democratic leaders and bosses who pursue the old line are taking political advantage of the failure of the Eisenhower-Nixon administration, but people must be vigilant about this, because they have not at the same time clearly guaranteed the pursuit of a peaceful policy. The people remember which party initiated the Cold War when it was in power. They also know that the Democratic leadership, together with the Republican Party, supports the Cold War and the arms race, and even exceeds the Republican Party in demanding increased weapons."

The statement said: All the power of the people must be mobilized to defeat the Cold War candidates.

The statement called on the people to hold marches, rallies, petitions and other similar actions to fight for a ban on nuclear weapons testing, to achieve complete and thorough disarmament, to hold honest negotiations, and to hold a new summit. The multifaceted struggle for peace during this crucial national debate must bring the labor movement into the center of the struggle.

### 美共书记处就美国破坏首脑会议发表声明  号召美国人民反对政府的冷战政策  列举许多事实驳斥艾森豪威尔为侵略罪行作辩护的强盗逻辑

    美共书记处就美国破坏首脑会议发表声明
    号召美国人民反对政府的冷战政策
    列举许多事实驳斥艾森豪威尔为侵略罪行作辩护的强盗逻辑
    据新华社伦敦2日电　美国共产党书记处5月26日发表了一项声明。声明的题目是：“最高级会议失败了——现在怎么办？”
    声明说：巴黎最高级会议的失败暴露了美国外交政策的深重危机。长期以来的冷战老调，以及要增加军备和加紧进行迫害的叫嚣，不能淹没来自许多方面的日益强烈的抗议，美国人民反对总是把我们导向更危险的边缘的政策。世界各地同声谴责这样一种政策，根据这种政策的Ｕ—2飞机的活动已告失败，并使美国的声望落到在现代历史上空前低落的境地。
    声明说：最高级会议失败的责任在于居高位的冷战鼓吹者。这些人在五角大楼、政府、获得有巨额利润的军事合同的大公司、两党的国会领导机构和“合伙”参加冷战的劳工最高领导等方面。他们在最高级会议召开以前加剧冷战，以便扼杀最高级会议。他们在日内瓦阻挠裁军的阴谋，强使增加军事拨款，赫脱、尼克松和狄龙的杜勒斯式的大肆叫嚷以及事先策划好的劳联—产联外交政策会议。这些都是“举国上下”推行冷战的可耻行动。
    声明说：美国总统到巴黎去时不是怀着要谈判柏林的新地位的愿望的，而是抱着阿登纳的顽固地反对任何改变的立场。尽管在日内瓦在废除核试验问题上取得了有希望的进展，而且人们普遍指望在最高级会议上将在这方面得到保证，总统却宣布美国恢复地下试验。
    虽然总统曾经强调裁军是主要问题，但是他却利用最高级会议来再次宣扬“开放天空”的理论，因此显而易见，他所追求的是监督其他国家的军备，而不是在普遍裁军方面进行相互监督。他不是设法寻求缓和国际紧张局势的办法，而是为导致Ｕ—2型飞机挑衅性飞行的理论辩解。
    声明说：比这种飞行本身更为令人吃惊的是总统为用来为这种飞行辩解的所谓理论辩护。
    根据这种理论，美国政府声称享有不顾一切国际法，任意在任何一个国家的领空飞行的片面权利。
    在以前几届政府和这一届政府期间，美国以类似的借口，在金门和马祖问题上形成战争威胁，侵入黎巴嫩，在七十个国家内驻扎一百万兵士，在全世界各地建立了二百五十个基地，推翻了危地马拉的民主政府，而现在威胁着要干涉古巴，使四万多美国人牺牲于一场殖民战争中，这场战争打死了一百万朝鲜人来把现在已被愤怒的人民赶走的它的傀儡暴君李承晚扶植上台。
    声明说：“开放天空”这个新的理论同预防性战争的疯狂性危险地接近。这是战争边缘政策的恢复而其危险的程度甚至超过了杜勒斯搞这种政策时所达到的程度。
    这些就是最高级会议垮台的真正原因。
    声明同时指出，苏联是吓不倒的。这个国家从来没有被吓倒过，那怕希特勒也吓不倒它，这个国家只有根据平等的条件，在不受到从实力地位出发的威胁的情况下，才愿意进行谈判。
    声明说：最高级会议垮台也不是由于政府方面的无能、笨拙或政策的任何具体错误或缺陷。而是由于执行了危险的政策，积极执行全盘错误的冷战方针。
    声明说：我们需要全国一致支持这样的一种政策，即：结束冷战，同苏联进行诚实的谈判来停止核试验，废除核武器和一切其他的恐怖武器，争取实现全面彻底裁军，使柏林和两个德国拥有大家都能同意的地位，让中国在国际会议上享有它应得的地位。
    我们不要“开放天空”的理论，我们需要互不干涉，进行友好的文化和科学交流以及在事务的基础上进行贸易的原则。
    声明还说：我们不需要建立在美国的武器和美元支持下的，由李承晚、蒋介石和特鲁希略当权的冷战帝国。
    声明然后谈到，美国官员不应当抱怨其他国家的“封闭的社会”，而应当看一下华盛顿的情况，声明指出，“在华盛顿，有几十个重要的行政机构在军事需要的借口下，连国会也不得过问。”
    “在大公司和联邦机构之间不断轮流任职的大企业负责人和军事首脑在幕后在他们自己中间安排事务。在军事秘密的借口下，几十亿美元的军火合同在五角大楼里谈妥，只有少数受益最大的垄断资本参加。”
    声明说：“让那些自称对所谓突袭的危险感到不安的人告诉美国人民，他们如何把科学裹上军事秘密的外衣，因而使科学本身受到很大损害，使整个教育制度受到不可估量的损害。
    “让他们公开承认‘开放家宅’的原则，在这个原则下，联邦调查局和其他警察机构强夺了侵犯人民秘密的权利，邮局得到了扣压信件和烧毁它认为是‘颠复性的’书籍的非法权利。或者让他们解释一下，对被传到非美活动调查委员会面前的守法人士进行的‘突袭’如何能同人民的关于什么是一个自由和公开的社会的想法调和起来，这个委员会的传讯践踏了宪法的基本权利。”
    声明驳斥了这种谬论：军备竞赛和挑衅性的“开放天空”间谍活动是正当的，因为这些活动对“防范突袭”是必需的。声明问道：如果事情的确是这样，那么为什么被公认在火箭和导弹方面居优势的苏联要呼吁用共同的协定来废除和销毁这些武器呢？苏联怎么能像一般公认的那样在一次又一次的和平运动中保持主动呢？苏联飞机有没有侵入我们的领空来测定进攻时的战略和工业目标呢？
    声明说：问题的真相是：苏联或任何社会主义国家没有任何一个人、一个阶级或集团能够从战争中得到好处。
    这是我们国家里许多身居高位的人所承认的。在最高级会议前夕，美国陆军发表了一项关于长期研究计划的官方报告，报告的结论说，苏联在理论上和在实践中都不会采取先发动进攻和消除西方“报复能力”的行动。
    声明说：使人们不再害怕突袭的办法就是结束冷战和谈判一项大规模的裁军协议，这是苏联所希望的。但是，一次又一次，当苏联接受了美国提出的建议，从而有可能达成初步协议的时候，华盛顿又撤回了这些建议。从一开始——自从1946年的巴鲁克计划以来——美国谈判代表就使用了以监督问题阻止达成裁军协议的诡计。苏联也坚持主张监督和视察，但是是作为查核和实施裁军协议的手段，而美国所要的监督不是为了裁军，而是作为在一场军备竞赛中估量相对实力的手段。
    声明号召美国人民把妨碍和平道路的政府铲除掉，并且号召人民击败麦卡锡主义。
    声明同时强调，“决不容许利用对Ｕ—2飞机越界飞行和最高级会议失败原因的调查，来为所有这些负责的人洗刷，不管这些人属于那一党派。也不允许他们避而不谈冷战政策本身这一真正的中心问题，或阻挠就这个国家在和平的世界中生存所需要的政策进行真正公开的辩论。
    “民主党里奉行老方针的领袖和党魁们利用艾森豪威尔—尼克松政府的失败而取得政治利益，但是却并没有在同时明确保证奉行和平政策，人们对此必须保持警惕。人民记得是那一个政党在执政时发起冷战的。他们也知道，民主党领导机构同共和党一起支持冷战和军备竞赛，而且在要求增加武器方面甚至超过了共和党。”
  声明说：必须动员人民的一切力量来击败冷战候选人。
    声明号召人民举行游行、集会、提出请愿和采取其他类似行动，来争取禁止核武器试验，实现全面彻底裁军，举行诚实的谈判，举行一次新的最高级会议。在进行极关重要的全国性的辩论时进行的争取和平的多方面斗争必须把劳工运动纳入斗争的中心。
