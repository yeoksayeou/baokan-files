Xinhua News Agency report: In the Jinbei area of Shanxi Province, which is currently severely affected by drought, more than 10,000 leading cadres at the prefectural, county, commune, and management district levels have gone to the most arduous drought-fighting teams to participate in and lead the drought-fighting struggle. In Datong City, more than 2,000 cadres led by the municipal party secretary and mayor have gone deep into the 18 severely drought-stricken management districts to irrigate the fields together with the masses. The Communist Party Committee of Zuoyun County has extracted more than half of the county committee members and ministers to lead more than 200 cadres to fight the drought together with the masses, and has urgently repaired more than 300 reservoirs, wells, canals, and more than 1,000 pieces of drainage and irrigation machinery. Guo Fenghang, the first secretary of the Communist Party Committee of Xiangning County, led 1,700 cadres to go deep into the management districts and production teams of the ten people's communes, mobilized the masses to summarize past drought-fighting experiences, and established the confidence that "man will conquer nature." The number of masses participating in drought resistance has increased rapidly. Under the slogan of "Plant one mu and harvest one mu, decide on one seedling and protect one seedling," they hoed the first time for more than 230,000 mu of autumn crops in three days, and also combined topdressing with water diversion irrigation and carrying water to spot-water 73,000 mu of corn. The first secretaries of party committees at all levels in Ruicheng County took the lead, and more than 300 cadres contracted the communes, management districts, and production teams by area. They worked with the local masses to study and adopt measures such as thousands of wells, hundreds of canals, and ten thousand waters returning to the fields, and large-scale repairs of drainage and irrigation machinery, based on specific conditions. They also broke down the boundaries of communes and management districts to organize large-scale cooperation, with water-rich areas supporting drought-stricken areas with water, and drought-stricken areas helping water-rich areas to level the land. In areas with sufficient water sources, high-lift irrigation, combined canal long-distance irrigation, and concentrated water diversion irrigation are implemented; in areas lacking water sources, water diversion to the walls, combined wells and canals, and water pulling and lifting for spot irrigation are implemented, so that drought-stricken land can be planted with crops in a timely manner.

The practical actions of the leading cadres, who are resourceful, hardworking, and skillful, have greatly encouraged the masses' determination to fight drought and ensure a bumper harvest. Under the slogan of "If the sky does not rain, people will bring rain, and the harvest depends on people, not the sky," the broad masses are fighting harder and harder. As of June 15, the Jinbei area has built wells, dug canals, and completed more than 2,000 highland irrigation projects, and repaired more than 300 pieces of drainage and irrigation machinery, increasing the summer irrigation area by 30%. In areas lacking water sources, cadres and the masses have jointly formed more than 2,200 water-carrying and seedling-watering professional groups, which have carried water to water more than 100,000 mu of seedlings in recent days. At the same time, the experience of fighting drought by hoeing seedlings more during drought has been widely used everywhere, and a comprehensive movement of early hoeing, more hoeing, and meticulous hoeing has been launched. At present, the large autumn crops such as corn, potatoes, and millet in the Jinbei, Jin Southeast, and Jinzhong areas have generally been hoeed once or twice. (Attached picture)

    干部分赴抗旱前线　群众相互协作支援
    晋北地区大力抗旱力争涓滴归田
    据新华社讯　山西省目前受旱较严重的晋北地区，已有专区、县、公社、管理区各级领导干部一万多人，分赴抗旱任务最艰巨的社队，参加和领导抗旱斗争。大同市由市委书记、市长率领的两千多名干部，分别深入受旱严重的十八个管理区和群众一起车水灌田。中共左云县委抽出了半数以上的县委委员、部长等，带领二百多名干部，同群众一起抗旱，已突击修复三百多处水库、井泉、渠道工程和一千多件排灌机械。中共乡宁县委第一书记郭逢恒率领一千七百多名干部，深入十个人民公社的管理区、生产队，发动群众总结了以往的抗旱经验，树立了“人定胜天”的信心，参加抗旱的群众迅速增加。他们在“种一亩收一亩，定一苗保一苗”的口号下，三天内就为二十三万多亩秋作物锄完头遍，还结合追肥引水灌溉和担水点浇玉米七万三千亩。芮城县各级党委第一书记层层挂帅，三百多名干部分片包干公社、管理区和生产队。他们和当地群众共同研究，从具体条件出发，采取千井百渠万水归田、大修排灌机械等措施，并且打破公社、管理区界限，组织大协作，由水地区支援旱地区用水，旱地区帮水地区平整土地。在水源充足的地方，还实行提水高浇，合渠远浇，聚水引浇；在水源缺乏的地方，实行引水上垣、并井合渠，拉水、提水点浇，因而使受旱的土地适时地种上了作物。
    领导干部们多谋善断，苦干巧干的实际行动，大大鼓舞了群众抗旱保丰收的决心。广大群众在“天不下雨人降雨、丰收由人不由天”的口号下，越战越强。晋北地区到6月15日止共已打井、挖渠、和完成高地灌溉工程两千多处，抢修好排灌机械三百多件，使夏浇面积扩大了30％。在水源缺乏的地区，干部和群众共同组成两千二百多个担水浇苗专业组，近几天内共担水浇苗十万多亩。同时各地普遍运用了越旱越锄苗的抗旱斗争经验，全面展开早锄、多锄、细锄运动。目前晋北、晋东南、晋中等专区的玉米、马铃薯、谷子等大秋作物一般都已锄完一遍到两遍。（附图片）
