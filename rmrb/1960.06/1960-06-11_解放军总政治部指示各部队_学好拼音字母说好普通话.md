Xinhua News Agency, 10th: The General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army recently issued instructions requiring that a surge of learning the pinyin alphabet and promoting Putonghua be immediately launched in the troops, striving to achieve significant results in the shortest possible time.

The instructions stated that on April 22, 1960, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions on promoting phonetic literacy, requiring that while using the Hanyu Pinyin alphabet to accelerate literacy, Putonghua should be vigorously promoted among students, teachers, young workers, farmers, shop assistants, office workers, and soldiers, creating a trend. Our army has new recruits every year, and quickly completing the literacy task of new recruits is directly related to improving the military quality and political level of the troops. The troops are a unified whole, and unifying the spoken language and promoting Putonghua are particularly important.

All soldiers and cadres (especially young cadres) of our army must conscientiously learn the Pinyin alphabet and speak Putonghua well, and should regard this work as an important task in the cultural revolution.

The instructions stated that all units should immediately adopt the method of phonetic literacy to carry out literacy work, creating a widespread atmosphere of learning Putonghua throughout the army. The content of learning Putonghua should be added to the company's cultural classes. Oral communication personnel, instructors, broadcasters, members of the cultural troupe, oral interpreters, film projectionists, etc., in the troops should undergo serious and strict Putonghua training, so that each of them can speak Putonghua well and become activists and backbone forces in promoting Putonghua in the troops. Each unit's club should also adopt and create some lively forms to cooperate with this movement.

    解放军总政治部指示各部队
    学好拼音字母说好普通话
    新华社10日讯　人民解放军总政治部最近发出指示，要求立即在部队中掀起一个学习拼音字母和推广普通话的热潮，力争在最短期内做出显著的成绩。
    指示说，1960年4月22日中共中央发布了关于推广注音识字的指示，要求在运用汉语拼音字母加速扫盲的同时，在学生、教师和青年工人、农民、店员、职员、部队官兵中大力推广普通话，造成风气。我军每年都有新的兵员补入，迅速完成新兵的扫盲任务，对提高部队军事素质和政治水平有直接的关系。部队是个统一的整体，统一语音，推广普通话，尤为重要。
    我军全体战士和干部（特别是青年干部）都要认真学好拼音字母，说好普通话，并应把这项工作作为文化革命中的一项重要任务。
    指示说，各部队应该立即采用注音识字的办法进行扫盲，在全军中，造成广泛学习普通话的风气。连队文化课应增加学普通话的内容。部队口语通信人员、教员、广播员、文工团员、口语翻译、电影放映人员等，都要进行认真的严格的普通话训练，使他们个个说好普通话，并成为部队推广普通话的活动分子和骨干力量。各部队俱乐部还应采用和创造一些生动活泼的形式来配合这一运动。
