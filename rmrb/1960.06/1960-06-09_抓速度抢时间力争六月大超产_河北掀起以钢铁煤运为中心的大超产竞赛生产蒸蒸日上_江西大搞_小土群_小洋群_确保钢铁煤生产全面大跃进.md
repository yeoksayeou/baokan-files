Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin – More than two million workers on the industrial and transportation fronts in Hebei Province are actively responding to the call of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to "Grasp Speed, Seize Time, Fight Hard in June, and Ensure the Completion of Half the Tasks in Half the Time." They are launching a large-scale overproduction competition centered on steel, iron, coal, and transportation to seize a bumper harvest in June.

The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that the current situation on the industrial and transportation fronts in the province is very good. The Provincial Committee pointed out that June is the decisive moment to ensure the completion of half of the annual plan in the first half of the year. It is imperative to seize every second, see immediate results, and turn June into a high-yield month with substantial growth. The key to ensuring a substantial increase in industrial production lies in increasing the production of raw materials by every possible means. Therefore, it is necessary to "take ten points of indicators with twelve points of measures," and focus on coal, iron, ore, and transportation to ensure an all-round leap forward with steel as the key link. The Provincial Committee also proposed eight major measures to turn June into a high-yield month with substantial growth: First, strengthen the leadership of industrial production. Party organizations at all levels in the province must resolutely and comprehensively implement the policy of "agriculture as the foundation, industry as the leading factor, and simultaneous development of industry and agriculture," vigorously increase the production of steel, iron, and coal, strengthen all aspects of industrial support for agriculture, and accelerate the technical transformation of agriculture. Second, rely on technological innovation and technological revolution to focus on the weak links in production and vigorously protect steel. In using iron to protect steel, coal and ore are weak links, so the current focus should be on coal and ore production. Large coal mines throughout the province should implement both hydraulic coal mining and dry mining, both back mining and tunneling, and boldly mobilize the masses to organize large-scale high-yield production. At the same time, accelerate the technical transformation of small coal kilns and build a new batch of small coal kilns. In terms of ore production, in addition to focusing on the overproduction of large iron mines, counties and communes throughout the province should be universally mobilized to build a batch of small iron mines to meet the needs of small blast furnace production. Third, accelerate the technological transformation of small blast furnaces and increase the furnace operation rate of small blast furnaces. All small blast furnaces that can be started in various places should be quickly started to smelt iron, ensuring that the furnace operation rate of small blast furnaces throughout the province reaches 80% in June. Fourth, focus on transportation. The first priority is to focus on the transportation of coal, ore, and iron, and ensure progress is tracked daily. All iron and steel plants are required to prepare for production in the rainy season and strive to have ten to fifteen days of coal and ore reserves before the rainy season. At the same time, a concentrated effort should be made to build small railways, and projects on selected good routes should be completed within a specified time. Fifth, focus on labor arrangements. Sixth, focus on the comprehensive utilization and conservation of raw materials. Continue to promote effective advanced experiences and new technologies, and open up new sources of raw materials in large quantities. Seventh, focus on people's livelihoods. From the municipal party committee to the branch, it must be done with one hand grasping production and the other grasping people's livelihoods. While grasping production, the lives of the workers must be arranged well, so that there is both work and rest, to ensure the continuous leap forward in production. All factories and mines should also do a good job in preventing heatstroke and cooling down. Eighth, the industrial front of the province should promote the leadership experience of the "two-five system" in agricultural production and improve leadership methods. Leading cadres at all levels should go to the front line of production and specifically lead production. Responsible cadres from the provincial departments and bureaus should go to factories and mining enterprises, adopt the method of "cultivating experimental fields," and promptly summarize experiences for comprehensive promotion. Leading cadres of factories and mining enterprises should go to workshops, adopt the method of assigning areas of responsibility, break through key points, create models, and promote comprehensively.

Currently, the large-scale overproduction competition movement centered on steel, iron, coal, and transportation is sweeping across the province's mines and factories with the force of a storm. Many factory and mine workers are responding to the party's battle call with practical actions of "once said, definitely done," launching competitions between factories, furnaces, and teams, and promoting the flourishing production of steel, coal, and ore. Workers at the Tangjiazhuang Mine of the Kailuan Coal Mine adopted the method of combining hydraulic mining and dry mining, combining tunneling and back mining, and launched a coal production battle. From June 1st to 5th, the average daily coal output increased by 3.46% compared to late May. The fifty-eight small blast furnaces in the five iron and steel plants in the Tangshan area vigorously promoted advanced experiences in the management of raw materials, and the average daily output of pig iron from June 1st to 5th increased by 68% compared to late May. Due to the increase in coal, iron, and ore production and the promotion of advanced steelmaking experience, the daily steel production level of the province has increased sharply. From June 1st to 5th, the average daily steel output of the five major steel plants in Tianjin, Tangshan, and other places increased by 22.8% compared to late May. The Tianjin No. 4 Steel Plant promoted the advanced management experience of the Shanghai Steel Plant of "everyone responsible for everything, everyone guarding every checkpoint." In the first five days of June, the average daily steel output increased by 31.5% compared to late May.

(From our correspondent in) Nanchang, June 8th – Jiangxi Province has adopted ten major measures to vigorously promote an all-round leap forward in steel, iron, and coal, work hard in June, and strive to complete half of the state's annual production plan in the first half of the year.

In order to seize time and grasp speed, and strive to complete half of the industrial production, especially steel and coal production plan in the first half of the year, the Provincial Party Committee called on party organizations at all levels in the province and the people of the whole province to resolutely implement the Party's General Line and the "walking on two legs" policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, and combining large, medium and small scales, vigorously develop "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups", build a batch of new "small indigenous groups" bases in a short period of time, and make "five small groups" of small coal kilns, small iron mines, small blast furnaces, small converters, and small railways rapidly put into production.

In order to achieve the above tasks and requirements, the Provincial Party Committee put forward ten measures. These ten measures are:

1.  Carry out appropriate technical transformation of existing blast furnaces and rapidly increase the average utilization coefficient of blast furnaces to more than one ton. For blast furnaces that have been built but not put into production, accelerate the progress of supporting work so that these furnaces can be put into production quickly. At the same time, another batch of small blast furnaces of three to eight cubic meters should be built and put into production as soon as possible.
2.  Immediately draw a part of the labor force from the agricultural front to participate in the production of steel, iron, and coal, and transfer them back to the agricultural front during the busy farming season. Ensure that the task of steel, iron, and coal production is completed without affecting agricultural production. All localities must learn to grasp both hands, grasp both industry and agriculture.
3.  All regions and coal mine bases should vigorously grasp the production of small coal kilns and actively build a batch of new small coal mines. Implement coal-iron pairing and divide some coal mines under the leadership of iron and steel bases to become joint enterprises. At the same time, it is also necessary to actively solve problems such as ore, electricity, transportation, and equipment matching.
4.  Vigorously grasp technological innovation and technological revolution. Closely combine technological revolution and technological innovation with current production, focusing on the production of raw materials, fuels, and materials, and vigorously promote and improve new technologies on the basis of consolidation.
5.  Grasp progress. All regions and enterprises should prepare a schedule, put forward requirements for output, quality, cost, and raw material consumption, and check according to the schedule. At the same time, schedules should be prepared for equipment matching, power supply, and transportation as much as possible. The progress of all aspects should be linked to each other and checked daily.
6.  Actively carry out cooperation inside and outside the factory, inside and outside the region, and inside and outside the province. Carry forward the communist spirit, give convenience to others, leave difficulties to oneself, and resolutely oppose localism and the wrong viewpoint of not taking care of the overall situation.
7.  All regions carry out evaluation and competition. Report once a day, check every three days, and evaluate every seven days. The conditions for competition and evaluation are: fast progress; high output; good quality; low cost; good completion of tasks (including transfer tasks).
8.  Break through key points and promote overall development. The whole province should establish pacesetters, and all regions and enterprises should also establish pacesetters. Grasp one point and promote overall development.
9.  Three go to the furnace front. Leaders go to the furnace front, publicity goes to the furnace front, and summary of experience goes to the furnace front. Leading cadres at all levels must go deep into the grassroots, deep into the masses, and understand and solve problems in a timely manner.
10. Strengthen the Party's leadership. The first secretaries of Party committees at all levels should take care of the overall situation, and currently focus on grasping industry, especially grasping steel and coal. The district party committees and the local and municipal party committees should have one or two secretaries plus several standing committee members to focus on grasping industry, steel and coal.

In order to achieve the above requirements, the Provincial Party Committee pointed out that it is necessary to resolutely oppose several incorrect ideological styles: oppose right-leaning conservative thinking, oppose the idea of breaking away from production, pushing back, and not rushing forward in the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, and oppose the procrastination work style.

Currently, all localities are resolutely responding to the call of the Provincial Party Committee, working hard and striving to ensure that half of the annual plan is completed in the first half of the year. (Attached pictures)

    抓速度抢时间力争六月大超产
    河北掀起以钢铁煤运为中心的大超产竞赛生产蒸蒸日上
    江西大搞“小土群”“小洋群”确保钢铁煤生产全面大跃进
    据新华社天津电　河北省工业、交通运输战线上的二百多万名职工，积极响应中共河北省委发出的“抓速度、抢时间，大战6月份，保证实现时间过半任务过半”的号召，开展以钢、铁、煤、运为中心的大超产竞赛，夺取6月大丰收。
    中共河北省委认为，全省当前工业、交通运输战线上的形势很好。省委指出：6月份是保证实现上半年完成全年计划一半的决定时刻，必须分秒必争，立见实效，把6月份变为大幅度增长的高产月；而保证工业生产大幅度提高的关键，又在于千方百计地增加原料材料生产。因此，要以“十分指标，十二分措施”，狠抓煤、铁、矿、运，保证以钢为纲全面跃进。省委并提出了把6月变为大幅度增长的高产月的八大措施：一，加强工业生产的领导，全省各级党组织，要坚决、全面地贯彻“农业为基础，工业为主导，工农并举”的方针，大力增加钢、铁、煤炭的生产，加强工业支援农业的各项工作，加速农业技术改造。二，依靠技术革新和技术革命，狠抓生产上的薄弱环节，大力保钢。在以铁保钢中，煤、矿石又是薄弱环节，因此当前要狠抓煤和矿石的生产。全省大型煤矿要实行水力采煤与旱采、回采与掘进并举，放手发动群众，组织大面积高产；同时加速小煤窑的技术改造，并且新建一批小煤窑，在矿石生产方面，除了狠抓大型铁矿的超产外，全省普遍发动县、社建设一批小铁矿，满足小高炉生产的需要。三，加速小高炉技术改造，提高小高炉的开炉率。各地凡能开炉的小高炉都要很快地开炉炼铁，保证6月份全省小高炉开炉率达到80％。四，抓运输。首先是抓煤、矿、铁的运输，做到按日抓进度。要求各炼铁厂做好雨季生产准备工作，力争在雨季以前都有十天到十五天的煤、矿石的储备量。同时要突击小铁路的建设，对已选定的好线路的工程要限期完成。五，抓劳动力安排。六，抓原料材料综合利用和节约。继续推广行之有效的先进经验和新技术，大量开辟新的原料材料来源。七，抓生活。从市委到支部都必须作到一手抓生产，一手抓生活，在抓生产的同时，把职工群众生活安排好，作到有劳有逸，保证生产持续跃进。各厂矿并要做好防暑降温工作。八，全省工业战线上要推广农业生产“二五制”的领导经验，改进领导方法。各级领导干部要深入生产第一线，具体领导生产。省各厅、局负责干部要深入到厂矿企业，采取“种试验田”的办法，及时总结经验，进行全面推广；厂矿企业领导干部要深入到车间，采取分片包干的办法，突破重点，作出样板，全面推广。
    目前，全省以钢、铁、煤、运为中心的大超产竞赛运动，正以疾风骤雨之势席卷全省各个矿山和工厂。许多厂矿企业职工以“既说到就一定做到”的实际行动回答党发出的战斗号召，开展了厂与厂、炉与炉和班组之间竞赛，促进钢铁、煤炭、矿石等生产蒸蒸日上。开滦煤矿唐家庄矿职工采取了水采和旱采并举，掘进与回采并举的办法，开展了夺煤大战，6月1日到5日煤的平均日产量比5月下旬提高了3．46％。唐山地区五个炼铁厂五十八座小高炉，大力推行原料材料的管理等先进经验，6月1日至5日的生铁产量平均比5月下旬提高了68％。由于煤、铁、矿石生产的提高，和推广先进炼钢经验，全省钢的日产水平猛增，6月1日到5日，天津、唐山等地五大钢厂钢的平均日产量比5月下旬提高了22．8％。天津第四钢厂，推广了上海钢厂“事事有专人负责，关关有人把守”的先进管理经验，6月头五天钢的平均日产量比5月下旬提高了31．5％。
    本报南昌8日电　江西省采取十大措施，力促钢、铁、煤全面大跃进，大干6月份，力争上半年完成国家全年生产计划的一半。
    为了抢时间、抓速度，力争上半年完成工业生产，特别是钢铁煤生产计划的一半，省委号召全省各级党组织和全省人民，坚决贯彻执行党的总路线和土洋结合，大中小结合的“两条腿走路”的方针，大搞“小土群”、“小洋群”，在短期内建成一批新的“小土群”基地，使小煤窑、小铁矿、小高炉、小转炉、小铁路“五小成群”，迅速地投入生产。
    为了实现上述的任务和要求，省委提出了十大措施。这十大措施是：
    一、对现有的高炉进行适当的技术改造，迅速地把高炉的平均利用系数提高到一吨以上。已经建成但没有投入生产的高炉，要加速配套工作的进度，使这些炉子很快投入生产。同时，还要再建一批三至八立方米的小高炉，并且使之尽快地投入生产。
    二、立即从农业战线上抽出一部分劳动力参加钢、铁、煤的生产，在农忙时再调回农业战线上去。做到既保证钢、铁、煤生产任务的完成，又不致影响农业生产。各地必须学会两手抓，既抓工业，又抓好农业。
    三、各地区、各煤矿基地，要大抓小煤窑生产，积极建设一批新的小煤井。实行煤铁对口，把一部分煤矿划给钢铁基地领导，成为联合企业。同时，还必须积极解决矿石、电力、运输、设备配套等问题。
    四、大抓技术革新和技术革命。把技术革命和技术革新同当前的生产密切结合起来，以原料、燃料、材料的生产为主攻方向，在巩固的基础上，大力推广和提高新技术。
    五、抓进度。各地区和企业都应当排好进度表，提出产量、质量、成本、原材料消耗等要求，按进度进行检查。同时，设备配套，电力供应和运输凡能够排的都要排进度表。各方面的进度要互相衔接，按日检查。
    六、应当积极地开展厂内外、地区内外、省内外的协作。要发扬共产主义风格，把方便让给别人，把困难留给自己，坚决反对本位主义、不照顾全局的错误观点。
    七、各地区开展评比竞赛。一天一汇报，三天一检查，七天一评比。竞赛评比的条件是：进度快；产量高；质量好；成本低；完成任务好（包括上调任务）。
    八、突破重点，推动全面。全省要树立标兵，各地区各企业也要树立标兵。抓住一点，推动全面。
    九、三到炉前。领导到炉前，宣传到炉前，总结经验到炉前。各级领导干部必须深入到基层，深入群众，及时了解问题，解决问题。
    十、加强党的领导。各级党委的第一书记要照顾全面，在目前要着重抓工业，特别是抓钢铁煤。区党委和各地、市委要有一两个书记加若干常委全力抓工业，抓钢铁煤。
    为了实现上述要求，省委指出必须坚决反对几种不正确的思想作风：反对右倾保守思想，反对技术革新和技术革命运动中脱离生产，往后推，不往前赶的思想，反对拖拖拉拉的工作作风。
    目前各地正在坚决响应省委号召，大干特干，坚决保证上半年完成全年计划的一半。（附图片）
