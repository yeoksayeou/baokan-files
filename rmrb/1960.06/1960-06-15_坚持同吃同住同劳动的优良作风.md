Editorial: Persist in the Excellent Work Style of Eating, Living, and Working Together

Yesterday, this newspaper reported on page three the moving deeds of Comrade Ye Yang, the Party General Branch Secretary of the Shishui Brigade of the Diancheng Commune in Dianbai County, Guangdong Province, who has been eating, living, and working with the masses for ten years as if it were one day. The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has called on all cadres in the province to take Ye Yang as an example, to further improve their work style, continuously improve their level of awareness and working ability, and more successfully complete various tasks. The call of the Guangdong Provincial Committee is very timely and correct. Now, a movement to learn from Ye Yang and persist in implementing the "Three Togethers" is unfolding step by step in various parts of Guangdong. This movement is of great significance to all cadres engaged in rural work throughout the country.

Comrade Ye Yang lives among the masses and eats with them, eating the same food; not only does he eat in the canteen, but he also runs the canteen. Through the canteen, the center of the masses' lives, he comes into contact with more people every day, understands their thoughts and living conditions, understands the problems existing in the canteen work, helps to improve the work, and comprehensively arranges the lives of the masses. In this way, he ran a "six-good" canteen that was famous throughout the county, planted twenty-five mu of vegetables, raised one hundred and five pigs, and expanded the family production of the canteen, which made the masses very satisfied. Because he grasped both ideology and life, he became the "intimate person" of the masses, learned many very important situations and problems, quickly and effectively made correct decisions, and promoted production in a timely manner. This may seem like an ordinary thing, but its significance is very great. Eating in the canteen and running the canteen are directly related to the arrangement of the lives of the vast number of commune members. Only by arranging the lives of the masses can we better arrange production. Rural work cadres should be like Comrade Ye Yang, acting as a good housekeeper for the lives of the masses, taking responsibility for the lives of the masses to the end, so as to motivate the political enthusiasm of the masses and inspire the drive for production. Not long ago, the Xuanwei County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Yunnan Province decided to abolish all the canteens of the county organs, and more than 10,000 cadres at all levels, including the First Secretary of the County Committee, all went down to the public canteens to eat and actively run the canteens. This matter spread like wildfire, inspiring 500,000 people in the county and pushing the mass movement to fight drought to a new peak. This is a powerful proof.

Since Comrade Ye Yang participated in work ten years ago, he has always maintained the identity of an ordinary worker and spent most of his time with the masses. The masses praised him and said, "After Lao Ye became a cadre, he is still the same as our commune members, without any cadre airs." In the autumn of 1958, the cashier bought an antimony pot to cook separately for the cadres of the brigade. Comrade Ye Yang said categorically, "What the masses eat, we will eat. Can the lives of our cadres be special? The antimony pot you bought is very good, so send it to the canteen to take care of the special needs of the patients." For two years, many people persuaded him to buy a bicycle, but he always said, "We are running in the fields to make production, and bicycles are not very useful. It is better to use the money for production." This spring, some cadres proposed building a new office building, but he also disagreed. In short, these special practices that easily alienated him from the masses aroused his great vigilance. He has always been closely with the masses and established an equal, comradely relationship with them. In this way, he not only became the best housekeeper for the masses, but also the closest confidant, sharing the same breath and destiny with the masses.

Among the "Three Togethers", the item of working together is very important. Comrade Ye Yang also excellently demonstrated his exemplary actions in this regard. He also worked 212 labor days last year and 61 labor days in the first four months of this year. One night in September last year, there was a sudden rainstorm. Although he was in bed with illness at the time, he still rushed to the water embankment in the rain, bravely jumped into the deep water, and used his body to support the gap in the water embankment, leading the commune members to carry out repairs. The example of Comrade Ye Yang and countless other facts prove that cadres and the masses working together, sharing weal and woe together, is an important aspect of cadres receiving training and improvement, and closely linking with the masses and implementing the Party's mass line. Labor production is like a large melting pot. The result of cadres and the masses working together is that they can "tan their skin black, temper their hearts red, and make friends even closer", and they can also learn a set of skills to lead production and become pioneers of agricultural science and technological innovation. In the process of working with the masses, it is also possible to discover problems that cannot be discovered at ordinary times and understand the urgent demands of the broad masses, which creates very good conditions for further improving work and strengthening leadership.

Today, among the vast number of rural work cadres, with the continuous improvement of political and ideological awareness, there are more and more good cadres like Ye Yang who persist in implementing the "Three Togethers" for years as if it were one day, working and living with the masses in the posture of ordinary workers, without any special treatment, without any airs, and without any bureaucracy. Because of the development of this excellent work style, it is possible to maximize the motivation and promotion of the masses' political enthusiasm and production initiative, and through the "Three Togethers", timely discover various advanced experiences and problems existing in the work, and timely promote and solve them, so as to better implement the "Eight-Character Constitution" in the countryside and act as promoters of production. At the same time, implementing the "Three Togethers" in actual life can better experience and apply the work style and work methods of the mass line advocated by Comrade Mao Zedong, truly achieve "from the masses, to the masses", better combine points and surfaces, better combine individual guidance and general promotion, and make leadership work more adapted to the current situation of the great leap forward in agricultural production.

Our cadres come from the people and serve the people. The vast number of rural work cadres have an even closer relationship with the countryside and the peasants. Therefore, we must always maintain the true qualities of the working people, adhere to and develop the "Three Togethers" work style of closely linking with the masses in the posture of ordinary workers. Promoting the "Three Togethers" work style is a question of cultivating the fine qualities of a revolutionary cadre, and it is a question of cultivating a revolutionary cadre to learn to master the leadership style and leadership methods of the mass line, so the "Three Togethers" should become a permanent system. As long as we all learn from Comrade Ye Yang and unswervingly develop the "Three Togethers" work style, we will be able to closely link with the people, draw infinite strength from the masses, overcome any difficulties, and accelerate the progress of our socialist construction.

### 坚持同吃同住同劳动的优良作风

    坚持同吃同住同劳动的优良作风
    昨日本报第三版报道了广东电白县电城公社湿水大队党总支书记叶养同志十年如一日地和群众同吃、同住、同劳动的感人事迹。中共广东省委号召全省干部都以叶养为榜样，进一步改善工作作风，不断地提高觉悟水平和工作能力，更加出色地完成各项任务。广东省委的号召，是十分适时的和正确的。现在，一个学习叶养、坚持实行“三同”的运动，正在广东各地步步深入地展开。这个运动对于全国农村工作的所有干部都有着重要的意义。
    叶养同志生活在群众中间，和群众在一起吃饭，吃一样的饭；不但吃食堂，而且办食堂。他通过食堂这个群众生活的中心，同更多的群众天天接触，了解群众的思想和生活状况，了解食堂工作中存在的问题，帮助改进工作，全面安排好群众的生活。这样，他办起了全县出名的“六好”食堂，种了二十五亩蔬菜，养了一百零五头猪，扩大了食堂的家底生产，使群众十分满意。由于抓思想又抓生活，他成了群众的“贴心人”，了解到许多非常重要的情况和问题，迅速有效地作出正确的处理，及时推动了生产。看起来这似乎是一件普通的事情，可是它的意义十分重大。吃食堂，办食堂，这直接关系到广大社员生活的安排。把群众生活安排好了，才能更好地安排生产。农村工作干部应当像叶养同志那样，作一个群众生活的好管家人，对群众生活负责到底，这样才能够激励群众的政治热情，鼓舞生产的干劲。不久以前，中共云南宣威县委决定把全县机关食堂全部撤销，各级干部一万多名，包括县委第一书记在内，统通下到公共食堂吃饭，积极办好食堂；这件事情一传十，十传百，鼓舞了全县五十万人，把大战干旱的群众运动推向新的高峰。这就是一个有力的证明。
    叶养同志参加工作十年以来，始终保持一个普通劳动者的身份，大部分时间都和群众在一起。群众称赞他说：“老叶当干部后，还是和我们社员一样，没有半点干部架子”。1958年秋天，出纳员买了一个锑锅，要给大队的干部另外单独作饭，叶养同志斩钉截铁地说：“群众吃什么，我们就吃什么，难道我们干部的生活就能特殊一些吗？你买的锑锅很好，就送给食堂，照顾病人的特殊需要。”两年来，许多人劝他买一辆自行车，他总是说：“我们是跑田间闹生产的，自行车用处不大，不如把钱用到生产上去。”今年春天，有的干部提议盖一座新的办公房子，他也不同意。总之，这些容易使他脱离群众的特殊化的做法，都引起了他极大的警惕。他始终紧密地和群众在一起，和群众建立起一种平等的同志式的关系；这样他不只成为群众的最好的当家人，而且是最亲密的知心朋友，同群众同呼吸，共命运。
    在“三同”中，同劳动这一条非常重要。叶养同志在这方面也出色地表现了自己的模范行动，他去年一年还做了二百一十二个劳动日，今年头四个月又做了六十一个劳动日。去年9月一个夜晚，忽然来了暴风雨，他当时虽然病在床上，仍然冒雨赶到水堤，勇敢地跳下深水，用身体顶着水堤的缺口，带动社员进行抢修。叶养同志的例子和其他无数的事实都证明，干部和群众一同劳动，一起同甘苦共患难，是干部得到锻炼提高，和密切联系群众、贯彻党的群众路线的一个重要方面。劳动生产好像一个大熔炉，干部和群众一同劳动的结果，就能“晒黑了皮肤炼红了心，交上的朋友亲上亲”，并且能够学会一套领导生产的本领，做农业科学和技术革新的先锋。在和群众一起劳动当中，还可以发现平时发现不了的问题，了解广大群众的迫切要求，就为进一步改进工作，加强领导，创造了很好的条件。
    今天，在广大农村工作干部中间，随着政治思想觉悟的不断提高，有着越来越多的叶养式的好干部，他们数年如一日地坚持实行“三同”，以普通劳动者的姿态和群众一起劳动和生活，没有半点特殊，没有半点架子，没有半点官僚主义。由于这种优良作风的发扬，就能够最大限度地激励和发扬群众的政治热情和生产积极性，并且通过“三同”，及时地发现各种先进经验和工作中存在的问题，及时地加以推广和解决，因而也就能够更好地在农村中贯彻“八字宪法”，作生产的促进派。同时，实行“三同”，在实际生活中，就能更好地体会和运用毛泽东同志所提倡的群众路线的工作作风和工作方法，真正做到“从群众中来，到群众中去”，把点和面结合得更好，把个别指导和一般推广结合得更好，使领导工作更加适应当前农业生产大跃进的形势。
    我们的干部来自人民，并且服务于人民。广大的农村工作干部，更同农村和农民有着十分密切的关系。因此，我们必须永远保持劳动人民的本色，以普通劳动者的姿态，坚持和发扬密切联系群众的“三同”作风。发扬“三同”作风，是培养一个革命干部的优良品质的问题，是培养一个革命干部学会掌握群众路线的领导作风和领导方法的问题，所以“三同”应当成为一个永久的制度。只要我们人人向叶养同志看齐、坚持不懈地发扬“三同”作风，我们就能密切同人民群众的血肉联系，从群众中吸取无限的力量；我们就能克服任何困难，我们的社会主义建设事业就能加速前进。
