Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 25th: The "National Movement Liaison Conference for Resolving the Okinawa Issue," composed of people from all walks of life in Japan, issued a statement on the 24th, strongly protesting the US government authorities' public declaration of permanently occupying Okinawa Island.

The statement accused the United States of violating the spirit of the United Nations Charter and going against the trend of world events with this atrocity.

The statement strongly demanded that the US government return Okinawa Island to Japan.

The "National Movement Liaison Conference for Resolving the Okinawa Issue" has sent a protest telegram with the same spirit to the US Secretary of Defense and delivered this statement to US Ambassador to Japan, MacArthur II.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 22nd: According to a report in today's "Asahi Shimbun," the Okinawa Prefecture Reversion to Homeland Council issued a statement on the 21st, condemning the US occupation forces in Okinawa for taking barbaric actions against demonstrators protesting Eisenhower's visit to Okinawa on the 19th and insulting the Japanese flag.

The statement said that American soldiers attacked the demonstrators and took away the Japanese flags held by students of Ryukyu University, throwing those flags into cars and taking them away.

The statement pointed out that this was a serious insult to the Japanese flag.

The statement pointed out that the US military in Okinawa mobilized 15,000 troops to threaten the demonstrators with bayonets and prepared to use tear gas, which is a disregard for the legitimate rights of the residents of Okinawa.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 21st: Japanese Communist Party General Secretary Kenji Miyamoto published a commentary in today's "Akahata" (Red Flag) newspaper, pointing out the significance of the Okinawan people's anti-American patriotic struggle protesting Eisenhower's visit to Okinawa.

Miyamoto emphasized that the Okinawan people, under the US imperialist military occupation and colonial rule, disregarding the suppression of the US military, resolutely launched anti-American demonstrations, and this courage and enthusiasm gave infinite encouragement to the people of mainland Japan.

Miyamoto said that after the Japanese people successfully prevented Eisenhower's "visit" to Japan and dealt a heavy blow to US imperialism, the Okinawan people are now launching a heroic struggle in such a difficult situation, which makes this victory even more brilliant.

Miyamoto expressed that the Japanese Communist Party supports the patriotic and just actions of the Okinawan people and will resolutely fight to the end with the Okinawan people for the final victory.
