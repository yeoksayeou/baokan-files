    Using the Paintbrush as a Cannon
    Chen Pei
    Opposing imperialism, especially opposing U.S. imperialism, is the common task of peace-loving people all over the world today. People have learned from practice that to achieve victory in this struggle, it is necessary to raise the awareness of the masses, eradicate all unrealistic illusions about U.S. imperialism, thoroughly expose the reactionary nature of imperialism, and expose the shameless lies of the running dogs of imperialism—modern revisionism. It is even more important to thoroughly expose the mask of false peace of Eisenhower, the "plague god" of U.S. imperialism, and restore his true robber's face. The trick of modern revisionists, represented by the Tito clique, who whitewash imperialism and try their best to dress up the "plague god" as a "messenger of peace," has completely gone bankrupt. Eisenhower's robber trip was met with a head-on blow by the awakened people of Asia. This is just the beginning, and more severe blows are yet to come. The Chinese people, from their long-term struggle, deeply realize that U.S. imperialism is the mortal enemy of the people of the world. Whether it is open aggression with bared fangs and claws or disguised peace with a smile hiding a dagger, it always remains the same, and its wolfish nature will never change. Only by closely uniting and carrying out a resolute struggle can the people of the world restrain the aggressive hands and feet of imperialism and safeguard world peace.
    Our art workers, in this sharp struggle with U.S. imperialism, have always followed the Marxist teaching that literature and art are weapons for educating the people, exposing, and打击ing the enemy, and have launched a resolute struggle against the enemy. The "Art Exhibition Against U.S. Imperialist Aggression, Resolutely Liberating Taiwan, and Defending World Peace" sponsored by the Chinese Artists Association this time concentratedly expresses the firm will and the conviction of victory of the people of all countries in their just struggle against imperialism. In recent days, the art circles of the capital, with boundless hatred, contempt, and disdain for U.S. imperialism, have used paintbrushes as swords and guns, and quickly created many cartoons, propaganda posters, prints, and sculptures. These works exposed and打击ed the enemy from various aspects and fully发挥ed the combat role of art. For example:
  “Sugar-coated bullets,” “Liars in Peaceful Clothing,” and other large numbers of paintings sharply pierce through the nature of U.S. imperialism as false peace, real war preparations, false easing, and real aggression. Cartoons such as "Disguise," "Cover-up," and "Thoughtful Service" mercilessly expose the ugly faces of modern revisionists, the loyal lackeys of Wall Street. Correctly expressing the masses' awareness and struggle in artistic works is the decisive factor in defeating U.S. imperialism.
  “The Storm of the Japanese People” and “Advancing on the Bloodstains of Martyrs” reflect the raging anti-imperialist struggle of the Japanese people. The roars of the Japanese people in front of the Diet make the war maniacs of the Pentagon tremble with fear. Works such as "People of the World Unite to Overthrow U.S. Imperialism" and "Gallows" embody the formation of the anti-imperialist united front of the people of the world, declaring the approaching end of imperialism. "The Whole People are Soldiers, Defending Peace" shows the great power of the Chinese people.
  “Eisenhower, Get Out, Fire!” The red giant cannon expresses the determination of the Chinese people to liberate their territory of Taiwan, blasting the "plague god" into panic. "The Just Voice of the Chinese People," this magnificent and huge painting, with red flags like the sea and people like a tide, transmits the firm will of the 650 million Chinese people in the anti-imperialist struggle through the just voice of millions of people in the capital in front of Tiananmen Square.
    This is an exhibition exposing the ugly nature of U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism. This is an exhibition embodying the revolutionary will and strength of the people. It is also an exhibition of the continuous victory of the people's revolutionary struggle. Our art workers will continue to use paintbrushes as weapons and, together with the people, constantly expose and打击 imperialism, and resolutely carry this struggle through to the end!

    用画笔当炮弹

    反对帝国主义，尤其是反对美帝国主义，这是当前全世界爱好和平人们的共同任务。人们从实践中懂得，要取得这场斗争的胜利，必须提高人民群众的觉悟，根除对美帝国主义一切不切实际的幻想；彻底揭露帝国主义的反动本质，揭穿帝国主义走狗——现代修正主义的无耻谎言。对美帝国主义的头子艾森豪威尔这个“瘟神”更要彻底揭穿假和平的画皮，还他真强盗的原形。以铁托集团为代表的现代修正主义者为帝国主义涂脂抹粉，费尽心机的把“瘟神”装扮成“和平使者”，这种骗术已经彻底破产了。艾森豪威尔这次强盗旅行受到觉醒了的亚洲人民迎头痛击，这还仅只是开端，更严重的打击还在后面。中国人民从长期斗争中，深刻地认识到美帝国主义是全世界人民的死敌，不管它是张牙舞爪的公开侵略，还是笑里藏刀的伪装和平，总是万变不离其宗，其豺狼本性是始终不会变的。全世界人民只有紧密团结起来，进行坚决的斗争，才能束缚住帝国主义的侵略手脚，保卫世界和平。
    我们美术工作者，在和美帝国主义这场尖锐的斗争中，一直遵循着马克思主义关于文艺是教育人民、揭露和打击敌人的武器这一教导，向敌人展开了坚决的斗争。这次中国美术家协会主办的“反对美帝侵略、坚决解放台湾、保卫世界和平美术展览会”，集中地表现了各国人民反帝正义斗争的坚强意志和必胜的信念。连日来，首都美术界，怀着对美帝国主义无比仇恨和蔑视、鄙视的心情，以画笔作刀枪，迅速地创作了许多漫画、宣传画、版画和雕塑。这些作品从各个不同的方面揭露和打击了敌人，充分发挥了艺术的战斗作用。例如：
  “糖衣炮弹”、“披着和平外衣的骗子”等大批的画幅尖锐地戳穿了美帝国主义假和平、真备战、假缓和、真侵略的本质。“装扮”、“打掩护”、“服务周到”等漫画则针对着华尔街的忠实奴才现代修正主义者的丑恶面目作了无情的揭露。在美术作品中正确地表达了群众的觉悟和斗争是打倒美帝国主义的决定因素，
  “日本人民的风暴”、“踏着烈士的血迹前进”，反映了日本人民如火如荼的反帝斗争怒潮。日本人民在国会前的怒吼，使得五角大楼的战争狂人胆战心惊。“全世界人民团结起来打倒美帝国主义”、“绞索”等作品体现了全世界人民反帝统一战线的形成，宣告了帝国主义末日的临近。“全民皆兵，保卫和平”显示了中国人民的伟大力量。
  “艾森豪威尔滚回去，开炮！”红色的巨炮表示了中国人民解放自己领土台湾的决心，轰得“瘟神”魂飞魄散。“中国人民的正义声音”这气势磅礴的巨大画幅，红旗如海，人如潮涌，天安门前，千百万首都人民的正义声音，传达了六亿五千万中国人民的反帝斗争的坚强意志。
    这是一个揭露美帝和现代修正主义丑恶本质的展览，这是一个体现人民革命意志和力量的展览，也是一个人民革命斗争不断胜利的展览。我们美术工作者将继续以画笔作为武器，和全体人民一道不断地揭露和打击帝国主义，把这场斗争坚决进行到底！
