    Promote Intercropping
    Intercropping and relay planting are good methods for competing for space and time, and are an important part of our farmers' intensive cultivation system. In the past, limited by manpower and resources, this cultivation method could only be implemented on individual small plots of land. Now, with the realization of rural communization and the improvement of agricultural productivity, it has become possible to implement this method on large areas of land. Of the approximately ten million mu of sweet potatoes planted in Shandong Province this spring, 80% have been intercropped with corn, sorghum, and other crops, exceeding any previous year. Many other regions are also implementing various intercropping and relay planting methods on large areas of land.
    Will intercropping and relay planting, with crops growing simultaneously on a piece of land, interfere with each other and compete for soil fertility? There are often two types of relationships between various crops: on the one hand, they contradict each other; on the other hand, they are related to each other. We must never only see the side where they compete with each other and ignore the side where they help each other. As long as it is arranged well and managed well, intercropping and relay planting can not only prevent the two or several crops growing simultaneously from interfering with each other, but also enable them to promote each other. For example, the intercropping and relay planting of potatoes, corn, and sweet potatoes implemented in many places in Shandong Province means that in the seedling stage, the seedlings are very small and do not interfere with each other in terms of light and ventilation. When potatoes are flowering and tuberizing, they are afraid of high temperatures and need moist soil. At this time, it is the period when corn is jointing and growing, which plays a role in shading and cooling the potatoes. At the same time as watering and topdressing the corn, it also ensures the moisture needed by the potatoes. After the potatoes are harvested, it is the critical period for corn to tassel, and at this time, the sweet potato seedlings have just been planted and do not interfere with the corn. After the corn is harvested, it is just entering the tuberization and growth period of the sweet potatoes. Intercropping tall-stalk crops such as corn and sorghum with short-stalk crops such as beans is also a good method. Last year, the Nanyang Management Area of the Taikang People's Commune in Duerbote Mongolian Autonomous County, Heilongjiang, conducted a comparative test of intercropping corn and soybeans and monoculture corn. The monoculture corn only yielded 241 jin per mu; the intercropped corn, excluding soybeans, yielded 584 jin per mu. One of the important reasons is that soybeans create more nitrogen fertilizer in the soil. Intercropping crops with different plant heights and shapes is conducive to ventilation and light transmission. Intercropping crops with different nutrient requirements is conducive to the appropriate regulation and full utilization of soil fertility. As long as we carefully study and grasp the laws of the interrelationships between crops, we can give play to their "mutual assistance and cooperation" side and overcome their mutually hindering side through proper arrangements and management, and make the fullest use of land and time. All localities have effective intercropping and relay planting configurations that have proven effective in their localities, and they should be earnestly summarized and promoted in light of local conditions. For intercropping methods that have not yet proven effective in the local area, experiments should be conducted first to find the most appropriate configuration method, and then promoted.
    Will intercropping and relay planting be detrimental to field management and mechanization, and will it require too much labor? After intercropping and relay planting are implemented, the environment and conditions for crop growth are different from those of monoculture, and management measures must be changed accordingly. The timing and amount of fertilization and watering, as well as the types and methods of fertilization, must be adapted to the characteristics of the intercropped and relay-planted crops. It is also necessary to ensure that the original crops in the field are not harmed when intercropping and relay planting this crop, and that the growing crops are not harmed when harvesting one crop. Of course, these will be more "troublesome" and require more effort than monoculture. However, the fundamental purpose of field management is to harvest more agricultural products from each piece of land. As long as more agricultural products can be obtained, it is worthwhile to spend more effort on field management. Furthermore, as long as the various crops are configured well, coupled with the implementation of tool reforms and other technological reforms, it is also possible to save labor or even reduce labor. As for mechanization, people are the creators of machines and the masters who control machines. Transforming and creating machines to make them suitable for the requirements of intercropping and relay planting is something that can certainly be done. On the other hand, the specific methods of intercropping and relay planting can also be appropriately changed to make them more conducive to mechanization. In short, things are mutually influential and constantly changing. We must not let existing agricultural machines and existing intercropping and relay planting methods limit our thinking and actions.
    Are intercropping and relay planting contradictory to rational close planting, and will they be detrimental to the increase of yield per unit area of a single crop? For crops suitable for intercropping and relay planting, the rational density should be considered and determined from the aggregate of several intercropped and relay-planted crops. If several crops are configured well, they can achieve a higher and more rational density than planting a single crop. Intercropping and relay planting not only do not violate the principle of rational close planting, but are also a good method for improving the degree of rational close planting. According to national plans and people's needs, a variety of agricultural products should be produced. Our goal is to increase the total output of various agricultural products that meet the needs of the state and the people. As long as they are properly configured and managed, the result of intercropping and relay planting will be a significant increase in both the unit yield and the total yield of each crop.
    In addition to intercropping and relay planting of agricultural crops, the mixed intercropping of young forests and some mature forests with agricultural crops is also worth greatly promoting. This can both strengthen forest tending and increase agricultural income. Last year, Changyuan County, Henan Province, intercropped more than 22,000 mu of forest land, harvesting 130,000 jin of soybeans, more than 50,000 jin of millet, more than 70,000 jin of peanuts, 1.3 million jin of melons and vegetables, and 1.24 million jin of feed such as alfalfa; at the same time, the survival rate of young forests was also greatly improved. Last year, the Xiahu Commune in Kaihua County, Zhejiang Province, planted corn, sweet potatoes, soybeans and other crops in more than 6,500 mu of young fir and oil-tea camellia forests and tea gardens, and intercropped more than 1,000 mu of vegetables in near-mountain and low-mountain forest land, harvesting a total of more than 1.2 million jin of grain and more than 200,000 jin of vegetables; the intercropped forest land had particularly good forest growth, tea production increased by more than 30%, and oil-tea camellia production increased by 10% to 20%. This year, many areas in Zhejiang and Henan have launched a large-scale forest intercropping movement, and the forest intercropping area in some counties has reached tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of mu; this spring, the forest intercropping area in Lushi County, Henan Province, reached more than 379,000 mu. In recent years, China's afforestation area has expanded rapidly. In 1958 and 1959 alone, the afforestation area reached 540 million mu, and there are a large number of young forest land in various places. Universally promoting forest intercropping has a huge effect on improving the survival rate of forest trees and increasing the production of grain, oil, feed, and vegetables. Many areas in Zhejiang have made great efforts to reform tools in sets for forest intercropping, and organized forest intercropping professional teams to camp on the mountains; some places in Henan have also built water conservancy projects in forest land and established local fertilizer plants and local pesticide plants, and carried out basic farmland construction for forest intercropping. By doing so, problems such as remote mountainous areas, insufficient labor, poor forest soil quality, and poor water conservancy conditions can be solved.
    For crops that have already been intercropped and relay-planted, field management should now be strengthened to adapt to the intercropping and relay-planting situation; in the summer and autumn seasons, there are still many places and many crops that can be intercropped and relay-planted. We should earnestly summarize the intercropping and relay-planting methods that have been effective among the masses for many years, and promote or try them out in accordance with the current conditions in various places. We should also continue to investigate, study, and summarize new experiences in large-scale intercropping and relay planting, and summarize the experience of improving tools in intercropping and relay planting, so as to continue to improve the technology of intercropping and relay planting. In this way, we can obtain higher yields and greater harvests on the same land.

    提倡间作
    间作和套种是争空间、争时间的好办法，是我国农民精耕细作的耕作制度的重要的一部分。过去，受人力物力的限制，这种耕作方法只能在个别的小块土地上实行。现在，随着农村公社化的实现和农业生产力的提高，已经有了在大面积土地上实行这种方法的可能。山东省今春种植的大约一千万亩甘薯，有80％已经间作了玉米、高粱等作物，超过过去任何一年。其它许多地区也都在大面积土地上实行了多种多样的间作、套种的耕作方法。
    间作、套种，同时生长在一块土地上的作物会不会互相妨碍，争夺地力？各种作物之间，常常有两种关系：一方面互相矛盾；另方面互相联系。决不能只看到它们互相竞争的一面，而忽视它们互相帮助的一面。只要安排得好，管理得好，间作、套种不但可以使同时生长的两种或几种作物不至于互相妨碍，还能够使它们互相促进。例如山东省很多地方实行的马铃薯、玉米、甘薯间作、套种，在幼苗期，苗很小，在光照、通风上互不妨碍；马铃薯开花结薯的时候，怕高温，需要湿润的土壤，这时候，正是玉米拔节生长的时期，对马铃薯就起了遮荫降温的作用，在给玉米浇水、追肥的同时，也保证了马铃薯所需要的水分。收获了马铃薯以后，正是玉米出穗的关键时期，这时甘薯苗刚栽上，对玉米也没有什么妨碍；玉米收获以后，正好进入甘薯的结薯和成长时期。玉米、高粱等高秆作物间作豆类等矮秸作物，也是很好的方法。黑龙江杜尔伯特蒙古族自治县泰康人民公社南阳管理区，去年作了玉米、大豆间作和单种玉米的对比试验。单种玉米的每亩只收了二百四十一斤；间作的，不算大豆，光是玉米每亩就收了五百八十四斤。重要原因之一是大豆给土壤中制造了更多的氮肥。植株高矮不同和形状不同的作物间作，有利于通风透光。需要的养分不同的作物间作，有利于土壤中的肥分的适当调剂和充分利用。只要精心研究，掌握住作物之间相互关系的规律，就可以通过妥善的安排和管理，发挥它们“互助协作”的一面，克服它们互相妨碍的一面，最充分地利用土地、利用时间。各地都有在当地行之有效的间作、套种的配置方法，应该切实加以总结，因地制宜地加以推广。对于在本地还没有证明行之有效的间作方法，应该先行试验，找出最恰当的配置方法，然后推广。
    间作、套种，是不是不利于田间管理和机械化，会不会费工太多？实行间作、套种之后，作物生长的环境、条件和单一种植的时候不同了，管理措施当然要相应地改变。施肥、浇水的时间和数量，施肥的品种和方式，都要同间作、套种的作物的特性相适应。还要做到在间作、套种这种作物的时候不伤害田间原有的作物，在收获一种作物的时候不伤害正在生长的作物。这些，当然会比单作的时候多一些“麻烦”，也要多费一些工夫。可是，田间管理的根本目的，是从每一块土地上收获更多的农产品。只要能得到更多的农产品，田间管理多费一些工也是值得的。再说，只要把各种作物配置得好，再加上实行工具改革和其它的技术改革，也可以做到不多费工甚至少费工。至于机械化，人是机器的创造者和掌握机器的主人，改造和创造机器，使它们适合间作、套种的要求，是一定能够做到的事情。另一方面，间作、套种的具体方式也可以适当改变，以便更有利于机械化。总之，事情都是互相影响、不断变化的。不能让现有的农业机器和现有的间作、套种方式限制住我们的思想和行动。
    间作、套种是不是同合理密植有矛盾，会不会不利于单项作物单位面积产量的提高？对于适宜间作、套种的作物来说，合理的密度应该从间作、套种的几种作物的集合体来考虑决定；几种作物配置得好，就能比种植单项作物达到更高更合理的密度。间作、套种不但不违反合理密植的原则，而且是提高合理密植的程度的一种很好的方法。按照国家计划和人民需要，应该生产多种多样的农产品。我们的目标，是提高适合国家和人民的需要的各种各样的农产品的总产量。只要配置得当、管理得法，间作、套种的结果，各项作物的单位产量和总产量都会大大提高。
    除了农作物的间作、套种之外，还有幼林和部分成林的林农混作，也值得大大提倡。这既可以加强林木抚育，又可以增加农业收入。河南长垣县去年林地间作二万二千多亩，收获大豆十三万斤，小米五万多斤，花生七万多斤，瓜类和蔬菜一百三十万斤，苜蓿等饲料一百二十四万斤；同时，幼林成活率也大为提高。浙江开化县霞湖公社去年在六千五百多亩杉木、油茶幼林地和茶园中种了玉米、甘薯、黄豆等作物，在近山和低山林地套种了一千多亩蔬菜，共收粮食一百二十多万斤，蔬菜二十多万斤；间作的林地林木生长得特别好，茶叶增产30％以上，油茶增产10％到20％。今年浙江、河南许多地区掀起了大规模的林地间作运动，有些县的林地间作面积已经达到几万亩以至十几万亩；河南卢氏县今春林地间作面积达到三十七万九千多亩。近几年我国造林面积迅速扩大，只是1958年和1959年，造林面积就有五亿四千万亩，各地都有大量的幼林地；普遍推行林地间作，对于提高林木成活率和增产粮食、油料、饲料、蔬菜都有巨大的作用。浙江很多地区为林地间作成套地大搞工具改革，组织林地间作专业队上山扎营；河南有些地方还在林地大兴水利工程、建立土化肥厂和土农药厂，为林地间作进行了田间基本建设。这样做，山地远、劳力不足、林地土质不好、水利条件不好等等问题，都可以解决。
    对于已经间作、套种的作物，现在应该适应间作、套种的情况加强田间管理；在夏秋两季，也还有许多地方有许多作物可以间作、套种。应该把群众中间多年以来行之有效的间作、套种办法认真地加以总结，按照各地当前的条件推广或试行。还应该不断地考察、研究和总结大面积间作、套种的新经验，总结在间作、套种中间改良工具的经验，把间作、套种的技术继续提高。这样，我们便可以在同样的土地上获得更高的产量，更大的丰收。
