Xinhua News Agency, June 28th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has received a telegram from the Central Committee of the Korean Federation of Trade Unions, expressing support for the Chinese people's just struggle against U.S. imperialism's aggression and for the liberation of Taiwan.

In its telegram, the Central Committee of the Korean Federation of Trade Unions extended fraternal greetings to the Chinese working class and the entire Chinese people, who are struggling against the aggression of U.S. imperialists and for the liberation of Taiwan. The telegram stated, "We express our boundless anger and severely condemn the aggression of U.S. imperialists against the Chinese people, and we firmly support the Chinese people's just struggle to liberate Taiwan."

The telegram stated, "The people of Korea and China won a great victory in the Korean War against our common enemy, U.S. imperialism, thereby shattering the myth of the so-called strength of U.S. imperialism and making a great contribution to safeguarding peace in the Far East and Asia.

"We firmly believe that the friendship and solidarity between the Korean and Chinese people, forged in blood, will be further consolidated and developed, and that final victory will be achieved in the struggle against armed aggression by the imperialists. The Korean working people wholeheartedly wish the fraternal Chinese working class and people even greater achievements in the struggle to liberate Taiwan and safeguard peace and socialist construction, under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong."

Xinhua News Agency, June 28th: The All-China Women's Federation of the People's Republic of China has received a telegram from the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Women's League, expressing support for the Chinese people's just struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression and for the liberation of Taiwan.

In its telegram, the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Women's League extended fraternal greetings to the Chinese women and the entire Chinese people who are struggling against U.S. imperialist aggression and for the liberation of Taiwan. The telegram stated that ten years ago, U.S. imperialism launched the Korean War and simultaneously illegally occupied China's sacred territory of Taiwan. All Korean women are filled with irrepressible anger and strongly condemn the U.S. imperialist aggression against the Chinese people, and fully support the Chinese people's just struggle to liberate Taiwan.

The telegram stated: "We firmly believe that the friendship and unity between the Korean and Chinese people, forged in blood and increasingly consolidated and developed in the socialist family, will become an important guarantee for achieving the victory of our common cause. All Korean women are resolutely struggling to force the withdrawal of U.S. aggressor troops from South Korea and to achieve the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, until the day we achieve final victory in the common struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression, to safeguard peace, and build socialism."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 27th: Tran Huy Lieu, Vice President of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, published an article in "Nhan Dan" today, stating, "'Yankees, get out of Taiwan!' This has been the call of the 650 million Chinese people for ten years. This call has received the sympathy of the people of Southeast Asian countries and the support of peace-loving and just people all over the world. This call is turning into action, forming strength, and will one day drive the aggressors out of this island of China."

The article pointed out that currently, U.S. imperialism is regarding the People's Republic of China as one of the main targets in its conspiracy to launch aggressive wars, and that the occupation of Taiwan and the occupation of South Korea, Japan, and South Vietnam are all part of the U.S. imperialist war plan.

The article pointed out that the Chinese people know how to deal with the aggressive ambitions of U.S. imperialism, especially the recent shelling by the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front to "welcome and see off" Eisenhower, which is the Chinese people's answer. The people of Southeast Asia, especially in Japan and South Korea, are also answering U.S. imperialism with the flames of anti-American demonstrations.

Tran Huy Lieu said in the article that the Vietnamese and Chinese people are glaring angrily at the common enemy—U.S. imperialism. The day when U.S. imperialism gets out of Taiwan and South Vietnam is not far off.

    朝鲜人民坚决支持中国人民解放台湾
    越中友协副会长说：占领台湾、日本、南朝鲜、南越是美帝战争计划的一部分
    新华社28日讯　中华全国总工会收到了朝鲜职业总同盟中央委员会发来的支持中国人民反对美帝国主义侵略和解放台湾的正义斗争的电报。
    朝鲜职业总同盟中央委员会在电报中对反对美帝国主义者的侵略、为解放台湾而斗争的中国工人阶级和全体中国人民致以兄弟般的敬意。电报说：“我们以无比的愤怒严厉谴责反对中国人民的美帝国主义者的侵略，并坚决支持中国人民为解放台湾而进行的正义斗争。”
    电报说：“朝中两国人民在反对共同的仇敌美帝国主义者的朝鲜战争中获得了伟大的胜利，从而打破了所谓美帝国主义者的强大性的神话，为保卫远东和亚洲的和平作出了莫大的贡献。
      “我们深信，以鲜血凝成的朝中两国人民的友谊团结将进一步地巩固发展，在反对帝国主义者的武装侵略的斗争中必将获得最后的胜利。朝鲜劳动人民衷心地祝愿在伟大的中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，兄弟般的中国工人阶级和人民在为解放台湾和保卫和平及社会主义建设的斗争中获得更辉煌的成就。”
    新华社28日讯　中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会收到了朝鲜民主妇女同盟中央委员会发来的支持中国人民为反对美帝国主义侵略和解放台湾而进行的正义斗争。
    朝鲜民主妇女同盟中央委员会在电报中向正在为反对美帝国主义侵略和争取解放台湾而斗争的中国妇女和全中国人民致兄弟般的敬礼。电报说，十年前美帝国主义发动了侵朝战争，并同时非法占领了中国的神圣领土台湾，全朝鲜的妇女怒不可遏，强烈地谴责美帝国主义对中国人民的侵略行为，充分支持中国人民解放台湾的正义斗争。
    电报说：“我们坚信，以鲜血凝成的和在社会主义大家庭中日益巩固和发展起来的朝中人民的友谊和团结，将成为取得我们共同事业的胜利的重要保证。全朝鲜妇女正在为争取美国侵略军队撤出南朝鲜和争取祖国的和平统一而坚决斗争，直到我们在反对美帝国主义侵略、保卫和平和建设社会主义的共同斗争中取得最后胜利的那天为止。”
    新华社河内27日电　越中友好协会副会长陈辉燎今天在“人民报”发表文章说，“‘美帝国主义滚出台湾去’，这是中国六亿五千万人民十年来的呼声。这个呼声得到东南亚各国人民的同情和全世界爱好和平、正义的人民的支持。这个呼声正在变成行动，结为力量，并将有朝一日把侵略者从中国的这个海岛上打发出去。”
    文章指出，目前，美帝国主义正把中华人民共和国当作它发动侵略战争阴谋中的主要目标之一，占领台湾和占领南朝鲜、日本、南越都是美国侵略战争计划的一部分。
    文章指出，中国人民知道如何对付美帝国主义的侵略野心，特别是在最近福建前线中国人民解放军开炮“迎送”艾森豪威尔，就是中国人民的回答。东南亚人民，特别是在日本和南朝鲜，人民也正以掀起反美示威的怒火来回答美帝国主义。
    陈辉燎在文章最后说，越南人民和中国人民正在怒视共同的敌人——美帝国主义。美帝国主义滚出台湾和南越的日子已经为期不远了。
