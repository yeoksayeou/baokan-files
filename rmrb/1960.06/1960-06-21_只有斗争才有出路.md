    Only Struggle Offers a Way Out
    Shu Xiuwen
    It has been a full ten years since American imperialism occupied our territory of Taiwan. Our compatriots have also suffered under the bloody rule of American bandits and their running dogs for a full ten years. Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu have truly become living hells, and the Chinese compatriots living there have suffered exploitation, devastation, trampling, and murder to the point of unbearable endurance. At this moment, Eisenhower, the head of the American bandits who caused the suffering and disaster to the people of Taiwan, harboring malicious intentions, rushed to Taiwan to carry out conspiracies and tricks, to plan a war of aggression in the Far East, adding fuel to the fire for the people of Taiwan in deep water and pushing them further into the abyss of suffering.
    Eisenhower is a plague god, a demon. Wherever he goes, he brings plague and disaster. Japanese people went on strike and boycotted classes, and tens of thousands took to the streets to march, surround police stations, and burn police cars to oppose Eisenhower's "visit." Seeing that the situation was not right, Eisenhower finally dared not go. This is a great victory for the Japanese people. The victory of the Japanese people was achieved through struggle. The Taiwanese people, who have suffered from the bullying of American bandits, can only rise up bravely and unite to carry out an anti-American patriotic struggle to drive away Eisenhower and all American bandits.

    舒绣文
    美帝国主义占领我国领土台湾已经整整十年了。我们的同胞在美国强盗和他们的走狗血腥统治下，也整整煎熬了十年了。台、澎、金、马真正变成了活地狱，住在那里的中国同胞受尽剥削、摧残、蹂躏、杀害，现在已经到了忍无可忍的地步。就在这个时候，使台湾人民遭难受灾的美国强盗的头子艾森豪威尔，包藏祸心赶到台湾去施展阴谋鬼计，布置远东的侵略战争，给予水深火热的台湾人民火上加油，更加走上苦难的深渊。
    艾森豪威尔是瘟神、是恶魔，他到什么地方瘟疫就带到什么地方，灾难就带到什么地方。日本人民罢工罢课，成千成万地走上街去游行，围警局、烧警车，反对艾森豪威尔去“访问”。艾森豪威尔眼看形势不对，终于不敢前去，这是日本人民的伟大胜利。日本人民的胜利是靠斗争得来的，受尽美国强盗欺侮的台湾人民，也只有奋然崛起，团结一致进行反美爱国的斗争才能赶走艾森豪威尔和一切美国强盗。
