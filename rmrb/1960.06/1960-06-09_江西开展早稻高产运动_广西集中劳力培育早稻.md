Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, June 2nd: Jiangxi Province is carrying out a large-scale high-yield early rice campaign, using high-yield model fields as the backbone to drive general fields.

Under the promotion of this campaign, the enthusiasm of rural cadres and commune members throughout the province for striving for high yields is growing stronger. Everywhere, high-yield model fields are being used as examples, and the experience and standards of high-yield fields are being used to further strengthen the field management of early rice. The unanimous slogan is: "Strive for every seedling in every field to be first-class, and every mu of early rice to catch up with high yields."

The high-yield model fields established in various places this year have fully played a role in driving general fields. In the selection and distribution of fields, the model fields include both old rice fields and new rice fields, both fertile fields and poor fields, both plains and mountainous and hilly areas.

Coming from high-yield fields and going to general fields, timely application of the production and management experience of high-yield fields to guide general fields is an effective method for driving and improving the production management level of general early rice fields. In order to timely promote the production management experience of high-yield fields, various places have generally established experience exchange networks and stations, with high-yield fields as the base, dividing areas into zones and holding on-site meetings to exchange experience. The experience exchange networks and stations established by the Shangrao Special District's communes with more than one million mu of high-yield fields as the core, regularly hold on-site meetings based on early rice management links and problems, introduce and promote the experience of high-yield fields, and guide the management of general fields. Not only is the successful experience of high-yield fields promoted and applied to general fields, but even problems that cannot be solved in general fields are experimented with in high-yield fields, and then promoted after experience is gained. Therefore, the commune members now call high-yield fields "fields for learning scriptures" and "fields for obtaining treasures."

Various places have established a regular evaluation system for field management between general fields and high-yield fields. Through evaluation, measures are continuously added to general fields, so that general fields closely follow high-yield fields. Shangyou County's communes have launched a competition to "learn from high-yield fields and catch up with high-yield fields" according to different types of low-yield fields, newly reclaimed fields, and late rice converted to early rice fields, so that general fields have caught up with high-yield fields through processing and fertilization, and are on par with high-yield fields.

Xinhua News Agency: Guangxi is concentrating its labor force to strengthen the late-stage field management of early rice, striving for a bumper harvest in the first crop. Party committees at all levels have generally taken measures to correct the shortcomings of excessively dispersed agricultural labor, and transferred labor to strengthen the front line of agriculture. The Wuzhou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China stipulated that: cooks, feeders, nursery staff and other logistics personnel should implement fixed personnel and fixed work, and extract the surplus personnel to participate in agricultural production; reduce the labor force of commune-run enterprises by half to strengthen agriculture; all cultural and art troupes should be converted into amateur propaganda teams and return to production teams; professional teams such as militia, youth, women, and agricultural middle schools that are separated from production should also return to their original teams for production. After organizational rectification and tapping labor potential, a large number of strong laborers were concentrated on the agricultural front. Government organs, schools and factories also regard supporting agriculture as their glorious task and try their best to send people to the countryside. The special zone has concentrated more than 75% of its agricultural labor force and invested in field management, which has greatly accelerated the progress of weeding and topdressing, and the daily progress of weeding has increased from 70,000 mu to 130,000 mu. Yulin Special District concentrated more than 80% of its agricultural labor force to invest in field management. Cadres at all levels took off their shoes and went to the fields to join forces in the fields, and generally strengthened the leadership of field management. Li Youjiu, Secretary of the Guangxi Autonomous Region Party Committee, and Gan Huaixun, First Secretary of the Nanning Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, went deep into Liangqing and Nama communes in Yongning County and found that some seedlings were not growing well, and about 10% of the seedlings had not been weeded and topdressed after transplanting. Therefore, the Nanning Prefectural Committee promptly convened a telephone conference to mobilize 100,000 cadres to go to the countryside to organize a large-scale upsurge of field management. More than 110,000 mu of early rice in ten counties including Binyang and Wuming were infested with pests, and 69,000 mu were quickly controlled. (Attached picture)

Jiangxi Anyuan County Lianjiang Commune's "field hospital" personnel insisted on going to the fields for office work, meals, and meetings, and took timely measures for early rice, observing each field, comprehensively studying, and prescribing the right medicine. This is them holding a "consultation" in the field. Li Tingzhi (Xinhua News Agency draft)

    江西开展早稻高产运动  广西集中劳力培育早稻
    本报南昌2日电　江西各地以高额丰产田为骨干带动一般田，全面开展早稻大面积高产运动。
    在这个运动的推动下，全省广大农村干部和社员争高产、赶高产的劲头越来越足，各地普遍以高额丰产田作榜样，用丰产田的经验和标准进一步加强早稻田间管理，为早稻加工加肥，人们一致的口号是：“力争禾苗丘丘一类化，亩亩早稻赶高产。”
    今年各地建立的高额丰产田都充分发挥了带动一般田的作用。在田的择选和分布上，做到丰产田既有老稻田，也有新稻田，既有肥田，也有瘦田，既有平原地，也有山地和丘陵地。
    从高产田来，到一般田去，及时运用高额丰产田的经验指导一般田，是带动和提高一般田早稻生产管理水平的有效方法。各地为了及时推广高额丰产田的生产管理经验，普遍以丰产田为基点，分区划片，建立了经验交流网、交流站，经常召开现场会，交流经验。上饶专区各公社以一百多万亩高额丰产田为核心建立的经验交流网、站，都根据早稻管理环节和问题，经常召开现场会，介绍推广丰产田的经验，指导一般田的管理工作。各地不仅把丰产田的成功经验推广运用到一般田，就连一般田解决不了的问题，也都通过丰产田进行试验，取得经验后，再行推广。因此，现在社员们都称丰产田是“取经田”、“取宝田”。
    各地都建立了一般田与丰产田的田间管理定期评比制度，通过评比，不断为一般田加措施，使一般田紧追猛赛丰产田。上犹县各公社按照低产田、新开荒田和晚稻改早稻田的不同类型，开展了“学丰产田、赶丰产田”的竞赛，使一般田通过加工加肥，赶上了丰产田，与丰产田平起平坐。
    本报讯　广西各地集中劳力，加强早稻后期田间管理，力争上造大丰收。各地党委普遍采取措施，纠正农业劳动力过于分散的缺点，调集劳力加强农业第一线。中共梧州地委规定：炊事员、饲养员、保育员等后勤人员，实行定员定工，将超余人员抽出参加农业生产；将社办企业劳动力缩减一半，加强农业；所有文工团一律改为业余宣传队，回生产队；脱离生产的民兵、青年、妇女、农业中学等专业队，也各回原队生产。各地经过组织整顿，挖掘劳动潜力后，大批精壮劳力集中到农业战线。机关学校工厂也把支援农业作为自己的光荣任务，尽力派人下乡。这个专区已集中了75％以上的农业劳动力，投入田间管理，大大加快了耘田追肥的进度，耘田日进度由七万亩增加到了十三万亩。玉林专区集中了80％以上的农业劳动力投入田间管理。各级干部脱鞋下田，会师田间，普遍加强了对田间管理的领导。自治区党委书记李友九、中共南宁地委第一书记甘怀勋，深入到邕宁县良庆、那马公社，发现部分禾苗生长不好，还有10％左右的禾苗插后没有耘田追肥，于是南宁地委及时召开电话会议，动员十万干部下乡，组织一场声势浩大的田间管理高潮。宾阳、武鸣等十个县有十一万多亩早稻发生虫害，迅速防治了六万九千多亩。（附图片）
    江西安远县涟江公社“田头医院”人员坚持办公、吃饭、会议三到田，及时对早稻采取逐丘观察，综合研究，对症下药。这是他们正在田头“会诊”。　　　　　　　　　　　李庭之摄（新华社稿）
