Xinhua News Agency, 19th -- Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said at a rally of various democratic parties against American imperialist aggression on the 18th that Eisenhower, the head of American imperialism, after sabotaging the four-government summit, hurriedly ran to the Far East to engage in conspiratorial activities. The evil purpose of Eisenhower’s trip is to barbarously interfere in the internal affairs of Asian countries, suppress the anti-American and patriotic struggles of the people of Asian countries, and support his trained lackeys, so as to continue to use them as tools for the United States to enslave the people of Asian countries.

The Japanese people’s struggle against Eisenhower’s “visit to Japan,” against the Kishi Nobusuke traitorous government and the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, is magnificent and raging, and it had already dealt a heavy blow to Eisenhower. However, until two days ago, Eisenhower still intended to go to Japan at all costs, stubbornly. This is because he wants to force the Japanese people to accept the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, establish a Northeast Asian aggressive bloc centered on Japan, firmly bind Japan to the war chariot of American imperialism, and push the Japanese people into the abyss of destruction. Eisenhower's robber trip further clearly exposed that U.S. imperialism is the pillar of all the most reactionary and corrupt forces in Asia, the greatest threat to peace in Asia, and the common deadly enemy of the Asian people.

He said that recently, the Kishi Nobusuke group, following the instructions of its master, U.S. imperialism, frantically and shamelessly created the "June 15th" massacre. The people of the world see very clearly that in this blood case, Kishi Nobusuke is the executioner and Eisenhower is the chief culprit. The ironclad evidence is irrefutable. Blood debts must be repaid with blood. Eisenhower owes the Japanese people another new blood debt, and the Japanese people will never forgive him.

Zhang Zhizhong pointed out that Eisenhower's robber trip has already become "a rat running across the street, and everyone shouts 'kill it'," and it is truly extremely stinky. But this stinky rat has a face thicker than an iron plate, and now it has scurried to Taiwan. We feel boundless anger at this head of aggression openly stepping on our sacred territory of Taiwan! We Chinese people know what means to use to punish him. The heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front has already held an anti-American armed demonstration on the Jinmen front to drive away the "plague god." We firmly support the decision made by the Fujian Front Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in the "Letter to the Military and Civilians in Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu."

Zhang Zhizhong emphasized that the US imperialist conspiracy to annex our sacred territory of Taiwan is not only intolerable to the entire Chinese people, but also intolerable to all patriotic military and political personnel in Taiwan. The United States has long been creating the so-called "Two Chinas" conspiracy, and recently, it has been planning "Taiwan autonomy" and creating "opposition parties." What is their intention? This should arouse the high vigilance of all patriotic military and political personnel in Taiwan! We hope that the military and political personnel in Taiwan will recognize the future, inspire great righteousness, and unite together to carry out continuous and resolute struggle against the American aggressors!

Zhang Zhizhong finally said that Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu are China's sacred territory, and the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu! U.S. imperialism get out of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu! Eisenhower get back from the Far East!

    中国国民党革命委员会副主席张治中讲话
    团结起来，同美国侵略者坚决斗争
    新华社19日讯　中国国民党革命委员会副主席张治中18日在各民主党派反对美帝侵略的抗议集会上说，美帝国主义的头子艾森豪威尔，在破坏四国政府首脑会议之后，又匆匆地跑到远东地区来，进行阴谋活动。艾森豪威尔此行的罪恶目的，就是要横蛮干涉亚洲各国的内政，压制亚洲各国人民反美爱国的斗争，给他培养的走狗撑腰打气，以便继续利用他们作为美国奴役亚洲各国人民的工具。
    日本人民反对艾森豪威尔“访日”的斗争，反对岸信介卖国政府和美日军事同盟条约的斗争，波澜壮阔，如火如荼，本来早就是给艾森豪威尔以沉重打击了。但是，直到前两天，艾森豪威尔还打算不顾一切硬着头皮到日本去，这是因为他要强使日本人民接受美日军事同盟条约，建立以日本为中心的东北亚侵略集团，把日本牢牢地捆束在美帝国主义的战车上，把日本人民推进毁灭的深渊。艾森豪威尔这次强盗旅行，更加清楚地暴露了美帝国主义是亚洲一切最反动最腐朽势力的支柱，是亚洲和平的最大威胁，是亚洲人民共同的死敌。
    他说，最近，岸信介集团奉行其主子美帝国主义的意旨，疯狂无耻地制造了“六·一五”大屠杀。全世界人民看得很清楚，这次血案，岸信介是刽子手，艾森豪威尔是元凶，铁证如山，不容置辩。血债要用血来偿还，艾森豪威尔欠下日本人民又一笔新的血债，日本人民是决不会饶恕他的。
    张治中指出，艾森豪威尔的强盗旅行，已经是“老鼠过街，人人喊打”，真是其臭无比了。但这只臭老鼠，脸皮比铁板还厚，现在又窜到台湾来了。我们对于这个侵略头子公然踏上我国神圣领土台湾，感到无比的愤怒！我们中国人民，是知道用什么手段来惩罚他的，在福建前线的英勇的中国人民解放军，已经在金门前线举行反美武装示威，驱逐“瘟神”，我们坚决拥护中国人民解放军福建前线司令部在“告台、澎、金、马军民同胞书”中所作的决定。
    张治中强调说，美帝国主义妄想并吞我国神圣领土台湾的阴谋，不仅为全中国人民所不能容忍，也是在台湾的一切有爱国心的军政人员所不能容忍的。美国早在制造所谓“两个中国”的阴谋，最近，又在策动“台湾自治”，制造“反对派”，他们的用心何在？应该引起一切有爱国心的在台湾的军政人员的高度警惕！我们希望在台湾的军政人员，认清前途，激发大义，一致团结起来，同美国侵略者进行不断的坚决斗争！
    张治中最后说，台湾、澎湖、金门、马祖是中国神圣的领土，中国人民一定要解放台、澎、金、马！美帝国主义从台、澎、金、马滚出去，艾森豪威尔从远东滚回去！
