The Friendship of the Chinese and Japanese People
Kamei Katsuichiro, Member of the Japanese Literary Delegation

Last year, when the draft outline of the new "Security Treaty" was first published, a considerable number of Japanese people expressed that they "did not understand." According to the results of opinion polls at the time, 50% to 70% of people answered, "I don't understand." There were two reasons for this. The articles of this treaty are very difficult to understand; it is difficult for people without specialized knowledge of politics, economics, military affairs, international law, etc., to understand. Another reason is apathy.

I would like to talk about this "apathy" first. Due to the cunning occupation policies of the US military and the influence of American cultural aggression, some people are indulging in pleasure and not seriously considering the future of their country. Some people even have the mistaken mentality that "there is probably no other way out except to rely on the United States."

Another reason for people's apathy is that the Japanese economy has maintained good times since the Korean War. Due to the increase in productivity, capitalists have been completely revived. They are more closely colluding with American financial capital than before the war. And the lives of people in various classes have also improved somewhat. Therefore, many people are content with the status quo and do not consider matters outside of their family lives.

Needless to say, this apathy is beneficial to the Kishi government.

However, since the beginning of this year, the situation has undergone tremendous changes. As the reformist members of parliament repeatedly questioned the new "Security Treaty" in the Diet, the government authorities' answers were very ambiguous. For example, regarding the scope of activities of the Japanese and American forces, the term "the scope of the Far East" is used in the articles of the treaty, but the government's answer about the meaning of this "scope" was different every day. Finally, Foreign Minister Fujiyama bluntly said that it included "Kinmen and Matsu." This answer greatly shocked the people. The essence of the "Security Treaty" was finally exposed.

Obviously, this is not only treating China as a hypothetical enemy, but it is simply arrogant like a declaration of war. The broad masses of the people were shocked and indignant at this. Anyone who has a strong sense of responsibility for Japan's past aggression against China says that this is the talk of a madman. More people have since joined the movement against the "Security Treaty."

During my visit to China this time, the first thing I truly observed was the strong anger of the Chinese people. After the victory of the revolution, the Chinese people have continuously extended a hand of friendship to us in order to be friendly with the Japanese people, but all of this has been trampled on by the Kishi government. It is only natural that the anger of the Chinese people is surging like a raging wave. As a Japanese person, I cannot help but feel acutely responsible for trying to persuade those who still support the Kishi government and approve of the "Security Treaty" to quickly change their attitude. This is an obligation we must fulfill quickly.

Now, the Chinese and Japanese people are establishing a united front against American imperialism. This is probably an epoch-making event in the history of the two countries. The history of Japan will also begin to unfold an unprecedentedly glorious first page from this moment. The Chinese people's support for the Japanese people's struggle against the "Security Treaty" demonstrates the true friendship between the people of China and Japan. I believe this is the greatest light in the second half of the twentieth century.

The Kishi government has been forcing teachers to conduct "moral education" for young people that is beneficial to the rulers. The Japan Teachers Union is currently fighting against this compulsory "moral education." This struggle is linked to the struggle against the "Security Treaty." If it is possible to establish new morals in Japan, then it is important to establish morals based on the concept of the unity of the people of China and Japan, and even the unity of all the people of Asia. That is, to clearly recognize the common enemy, strengthen unity, and strive for peace. The struggle against the "Security Treaty" has such important educational significance.

The self-transformation of Japanese intellectuals is also a problem. Since accepting European culture in the second half of the nineteenth century, the ideological education of Japanese intellectuals has been almost completely leaning towards Europe, and then towards the United States. I believe that it is important to learn the good things from the culture of any country. However, Japanese intellectuals care too little about the culture, politics, and people of Asia. There are not many writers who have studied Chinese culture and politics in depth. I believe that the self-transformation of Japanese intellectuals is to strive to improve their awareness as a member of Asia. It is important to comprehensively study China's long tradition and new creativity.

Sino-Japanese friendship should not be a temporary political slogan. We must make long-term and continuous efforts to increase the close connection between hearts and minds. The struggle against the "Security Treaty" not only made people clearly recognize that the common enemy of the people of China and Japan is American imperialism, but also made people consciously realize that the spiritual connection between the people of China and Japan is strong and the friendship is deep. On the basis of this understanding, learning to enhance mutual understanding will become a powerful driving force for the struggle.

I would like to regard everything I have said above as the fundamental mission of the Japanese people in the current situation.

### 日中人民的友谊

    日中人民的友谊
    日本文学家代表团团员　龟井胜一郎
    去年，当新“安全条约”的纲要草案刚发表的时候，有相当一部分的日本人民表示“不了解”。据当时进行的舆论调查结果，就有50％乃至70％的人回答说：“不了解”。其中有两个原因。这项条约的条文非常难懂，如果是没有政治、经济、军事、国际法等专门的知识的人，是很难懂的。另外一个原因，就是漠不关心。
    我想首先谈谈“漠不关心”这一点。由于美军狡猾的占领政策和美国文化侵略的影响，一部分人沉湎于享乐之中，不去认真地考虑祖国的前途。有的人甚至有“只有靠美国，此外恐怕不会有其他出路”的错误心理。
    另外一个使人们漠不关心的原因是，日本经济自从朝鲜战争以来一直保持着好景气。由于生产力的增长，资本家完全复活了。他们同美国金融资本密切勾结的程度超过了战前。而各个阶层人民的生活也有了一些好转。因此，许多人满足于现状，不考虑自己家庭生活以外的事情。
    不言而喻，这种漠不关心的情况，有利于岸政权。
    但是，到了今年以后，情况发生了巨大的变化。随着革新派议员在国会里对新“安全条约”反复进行质询，政府当局的答辩非常含糊。譬如，关于日美两军的行动范围，在条约的条文中使用着“远东的范围”这个词儿，可是，关于这个“范围”的涵义，政府的答辩天天不同。最后，藤山外相断然说，它包括“金门、马祖”。这个回答使人民受到了很大的震动。“安全条约”的本质，终于暴露出来了。
    显然，这不仅是把中国当作假想敌，而且是简直等于宣战一样的狂妄。广大人民对此感到惊愕和愤慨。只要对于日本过去侵略中国的行动怀着强烈的责任感的人，都说这是狂人的话。更多的人就从此参加到反对“安全条约”的运动中来了。
    我这次访问中国，最先确实观察到的是：中国人民的强烈的愤怒情绪。中国人民在革命胜利以后，为了同日本人民友好，一直不断地向我们伸出了友谊的手，但所有这些，都被岸政府残踏了。中国人民的愤怒像怒涛一样地澎湃起来，这是理所当然的。作为一个日本人，我不能不痛切地感到有责任努力说服那些到今天还在支持岸政府、赞成“安全条约”的人，使他们迅速改变态度。这是我们要迅速履行的义务。
    现在，中国人民和日本人民正在建立反对美国帝国主义的联合战线。这恐怕是两国历史上划时代的事情。日本的历史也将从这个时候起揭开空前未有的光辉的第一页。中国人民对日本人民反对“安全条约”斗争的支援，表明了日中两国人民之间的真正的友谊。我认为这是二十世纪后半期的最大的光明。
    岸政府一直在强迫教师对青少年进行有利于统治者的“道德教育”。日本教职员工会目前还在同这种强制性的“道德教育”进行着斗争。这场斗争是同反对“安全条约”斗争联系起来的。如果在日本可能建立新的道德的话，那么，重要的是建立以日中两国人民的团结，乃至亚洲全体人民的团结观念为基础的道德。也就是明确地认清共同敌人，加强团结，争取和平的道德。反对“安全条约”的斗争，就具有这样的重要的教育意义。
    日本知识分子的自我改造，也是一个问题。自从在十九世纪后半期接受欧洲文化以来，日本的知识分子的思想教育几乎完全是向欧洲一边倒的，接着就向美国一边倒了。我认为，不论是哪一个国家的文化，好的东西就要学习，这是重要的。但是，日本的知识分子对于亚洲的文化、政治和人民，关心得太少了。深入地学习过中国的文化和政治的文学家就不多。我认为，日本知识分子的自我改造，就是要努力提高作为亚洲一员的自觉。全面地学习中国的悠久的传统和新的创造性，是重要的。
    日中友好不应当是暂时的政治口号。必须长期不断地努力，增进心与心的密切联系。反对“安全条约”的斗争不仅使人明确地认清了日中两国人民的共同敌人是美国帝国主义，而且还使人自觉地认识到日中两国人民的精神联系是坚强的，友谊是深厚的。在这样的认识的基础上，为了增进相互的了解而进行学习，将会成为斗争的强大的原动力。
    我想把前面所说的一切作为日本人在目前情况下的根本的使命。
