Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou. After the cotton sowing in the cotton-growing cities and counties of the Hexi Corridor in Gansu Province was completed successively, they launched a mass campaign of inspection, replenishment, and seedling-stage management, striving to ensure that this year's cotton is well planted, well managed, highly productive, and abundant.

This year, most of the cotton in the Hexi Corridor was planted in drought-resistant conditions. Anxi, Dunhuang, Yumen, Gaotai, Jiuquan, and other key cotton-producing areas have exceeded this year's sowing plans by 10% to 54% respectively. As soon as the sowing was completed, all localities immediately shifted to field management such as loosening the soil to conserve moisture. People's communes and state farms prepared a large number of branches, weeds, reeds, etc., and lit fires to create smoke when the cold wave arrived, overcoming the invasion of several late frosts in early and mid-May, and protecting the normal growth of cotton seedlings.

All localities are also seizing the time to remove weeds from field ridges, inside fields, ditch edges, and canal banks, spreading "666" pesticide powder, and making green grass poison bait to prevent cutworms.

At present, some counties and communes are clearing warehouses, transporting accumulated chemical fertilizers, pesticides, dusting and spraying machines, etc. to cotton-planting production teams; at the same time, they are modifying and imitating pest and disease control equipment and cultivating tools, etc., vigorously supporting field management work during the seedling stage.

    精管棉田保护幼苗成长
    甘肃发动群众大查棉田大补棉苗
    据新华社兰州电　甘肃省河西走廊各植棉市、县，在棉花播种先后结束以后。展开了群众性的大查大补和苗期管理活动，力争今年棉花种好、管好、高产、多收。
    今年河西走廊棉花大部分是抗旱播种的。安西、敦煌、玉门、高台、酒泉等重点棉区都分别超额10％到54％完成今年的播种计划。各地在播种一结束，立即转入松土保墒等田间管理。各人民公社和国营农场准备了大批树枝、杂草、芦苇等，在寒潮到来时点火熏烟，战胜了5月上、中旬几次晚霜冻的侵袭，保护了棉花幼苗正常生长。
    各地并抓紧铲除地埂、地内、沟边、渠畔杂草，撒布“六六六”药粉，制造青草毒饵等措施，防治地老虎。
    目前，部分县、社正在清查仓库，将积存的化肥、农药、喷粉、喷雾器等运送到植棉生产队；同时，改制、仿造防治病虫害的器械和中耕工具等。大力支援苗期田间管理工作。
