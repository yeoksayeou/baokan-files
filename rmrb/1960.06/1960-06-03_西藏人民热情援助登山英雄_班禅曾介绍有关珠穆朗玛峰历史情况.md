Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa — In the process of conquering Mount Everest, the Chinese Mountaineering Team received strong assistance and spiritual encouragement from the CPC Tibet Working Committee, the People's Liberation Army Tibet Military Region, and the Preparatory Committee of the Autonomous Region, as well as active support from the Tibetan people who have deep feelings for Mount Everest.

In March, when the mountaineering team arrived in Lhasa, Zhang Jingwu, representative of the Central People's Government in Tibet and secretary of the CPC Tibet Working Committee, Panchen Erdeni, acting chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Autonomous Region, and Tan Guansan, political commissar of the Tibet Military Region, met with them and encouraged them, saying that Tibet is the roof of the world, with many world-famous peaks, which is precisely where mountaineers can use their skills. They expressed hope that the team would traverse all the peaks, striving for scientific research and resource discovery, and for the construction of China's socialist cause. Panchen Erdeni also introduced the legends and historical information about Mount Everest to the mountaineers, hoping that the pioneering feat of conquering Mount Everest from the north slope would widely promote mountaineering in the Tibetan region.

The CPC Tibet Working Committee and the Tibet Military Region, in order to support the mountaineering team, assigned special personnel to establish a support committee, helping to solve problems such as transportation and material supply, and sent a慰问团(comfort group) to the mountaineering team's base camp to give慰问(condolence) performances and show movies.

The Tibetan people, who became masters of the magnificent mountains and rivers after liberation, regarded conquering Mount Everest as their glory, selected their best children, let them join the mountaineering team, and learn the skills to conquer nature. On the way from Lhasa to the Mount Everest area, wherever the mountaineering team went, the Tibetan people warmly welcomed them. People in Dingri, Xegar, and other places near Mount Everest regarded supporting the mountaineering team as the most glorious duty, selecting the fattest cattle and sheep and the best firewood to supply the team.

The mountaineers became the closest neighbors of the lamas of Rongbuk Monastery at the foot of Mount Everest. The lamas not only often came to the base camp as guests, but also gave up the best houses and invited the team members to rest.

Currently, the CPC Tibet Working Committee, the Lhasa Municipal Committee, the Preparatory Committee of the Autonomous Region, and the Tibet Military Region have jointly formed a welcoming and reception committee, preparing to warmly welcome and receive the heroes who are about to return triumphantly after conquering Mount Everest.

    西藏人民热情援助登山英雄
    班禅曾介绍有关珠穆朗玛峰历史情况
    新华社拉萨电　中国登山队在征服珠穆朗玛峰的过程中，得到中共西藏工委、人民解放军西藏军区和自治区筹委会等多方面的大力帮助和精神上的鼓舞，也得到了对珠穆朗玛峰有着深厚感情的西藏人民的积极支援。
    3月间，登山队到达拉萨时，中央人民政府驻西藏代表、中共西藏工委书记张经武，自治区筹委会代理主任委员班禅额尔德尼，西藏军区政治委员谭冠三等曾经接见了他们，并且勉励他们说，西藏是世界屋脊，有着许多世界著名的高峰，正是登山队员用武的地方，希望他们把足迹踏遍各个山峰，为科学研究和发现资源，为建设我国社会主义事业而努力。班禅额尔德尼还为登山队员介绍了有关珠穆朗玛峰的传说和历史情况，希望通过从北坡征服珠穆朗玛峰的创举，在西藏地区广泛开展登山运动。
    中共西藏工委和西藏军区为支援登山队，抽调出专人成立了支援委员会，帮助解决交通运输和物资供应等方面的问题，并派出慰问团前往登山队大本营进行慰问演出和放映电影。
    翻身后做了壮丽山河主人的藏族人民，把征服珠穆朗玛峰当作自己的光荣，选拔出最优秀的子弟，让他们参加登山队伍，学习征服大自然的本领。登山队从拉萨出发去珠穆朗玛峰山区的途中，登山队走到哪里，哪里的藏族人民就热情地欢迎他们。靠近珠穆朗玛峰的定曰、协噶尔等地的人民，把支援登山队看做是最光荣的义务，他们挑选了最肥的牛羊和上等烧柴供给登山队。
    登山队员成为珠穆朗玛峰下绒布寺喇嘛的最亲近的邻居。喇嘛们不但常到大本营来作客，还让出最好的房屋，邀请队员去休养。
    目前，中共西藏工委、拉萨市委、自治区筹备委员会和西藏军区已经联合组成了欢迎和接待委员会，准备热烈欢迎和接待即将凯旋归来的征服珠穆朗玛峰的英雄们。
