Xinhua News Agency, June 17th, Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government, already at the end of its road, is making a desperate struggle, plotting to expand the bloody suppression of the Japanese people's patriotic struggle against the United States and Kishi.
    The ruling Liberal Democratic Party of Japan today passed a so-called "exclusion of violence" resolution. This resolution says with murderous intent that "in order to maintain law and order, the government must quickly take all measures to find ways to eliminate violence."
    In order to create a pretext for the Kishi Nobusuke government to expand its suppression, this resolution openly slanders the patriotic actions of the broad masses of Japanese people against the United States and Kishi as "a minority of people frequently using violence collectively and in a planned manner," and also says that "all violence... is an enemy of peace and democracy."
    This resolution of the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party was made after Kishi Nobusuke's bloody statement on the 16th, which slandered the Japanese people's patriotic struggle against the United States and Kishi as "collective violence" and called for "resolutely attacking it."
    The Chairman of the Japanese National Public Safety Commission, Kiichiro Ishihara, revealed on the 16th that the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet had decided to hold a joint meeting of suppression agencies such as the Ministry of Justice, the Public Security Investigation Agency, and the National Police Agency at the beginning of next month to discuss revising the "Police Officer Duty Execution Law," the "Subversive Activities Prevention Law," and other issues in order to further strengthen fascist suppression. To this end, the joint meeting will also discuss strengthening police equipment and "the quality and quantity of the police."
    Under the instruction of the Kishi Nobusuke government, seven Japanese bourgeois newspapers issued a joint statement clamoring to "exclude violence" and drumming up support for the fascist suppression policy of the Kishi Nobusuke government.
    Currently, the Kishi Nobusuke government's suppression of the Japanese people is intensifying throughout Japan. After creating a great tragedy in Tokyo in which protesting students were killed, it brutally suppressed students participating in demonstrations in Fukuoka City in southern Japan on the 16th. In this new bloody incident, the police of the Kishi Nobusuke government injured eleven students. This bloody incident occurred when 4,500 students in Fukuoka City held demonstrations to protest the Kishi Nobusuke government's bloody suppression of students in Tokyo.

    已处穷途末路　犹作垂死挣扎
    岸信介政府加紧血腥镇压
    自由民主党通过法西斯决议阴谋扩大镇压活动
    福冈又发生警察打伤十一名学生的流血事件
    新华社17日讯　东京消息：已经处于穷途末路的日本岸信介政府正进行垂死挣扎，阴谋扩大对日本人民反美反岸的爱国斗争的血腥镇压。
    日本执政党自由民主党今天通过了一项所谓“排除暴力”的决议。这项决议杀气腾腾地说，“政府为了维持法律和秩序，要迅速采取一切措施，设法扫清暴力”。
    岸信介集团为了给岸信介政府扩大镇压制造借口，这项决议公然诬蔑日本广大人民的反美反岸爱国行动是“少数人经常集体地、有计划地使用暴力”，并且说什么“一切暴力……都是破坏和平、民主的敌人”。
    日本自由民主党的这项决议是在岸信介16日发表的诬蔑日本人民反美反岸爱国斗争为“集体暴力”，要“断然加以打击”的血腥声明以后作出的。
    日本国家公安委员会委员长石原干市郎曾经在16日透露，岸信介内阁曾经决定要在下月初举行法务省、公安调查厅、警察厅等镇压机构的联席会议，讨论修改“警察官职务执行法”、“破坏活动防止法”等问题，以便进一步加强法西斯镇压。为此，联席会议还要讨论“加强警察”的装备和“警察的质量和数量问题”。
    在岸信介政府的指使下，日本七家资产阶级报纸发表联合声明，叫嚷要“排除暴力”，替岸信介政府的法西斯镇压政策敲锣打鼓。
    目前，岸信介政府在日本全国各地对日本人民的镇压正变本加厉。在东京制造了杀害示威学生的大惨案以后，16日又在日本南部的福冈市残酷镇压参加示威的学生。在这次新的流血事件中岸信介政府的警察打伤了十一名学生。这次流血事件是在福冈市的四千五百名学生举行示威，抗议岸信介政府在东京血腥镇压学生的暴行时发生的。
