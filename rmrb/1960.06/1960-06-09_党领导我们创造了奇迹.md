    Party Leadership Enables Us to Create Miracles
    Representative of the Surgical Teaching and Research Group of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wuhan Medical College, Tong Erchang
    I represent the Surgical Teaching and Research Group of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wuhan Medical College, and I am here to report to the leaders and comrades on the battle to rescue our class brother, Cheng Debao.
    In the first spring of the 1960s, the comrades of the Surgical Teaching and Research Group of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wuhan Medical College successively rescued many critically ill patients. The victory in rescuing Comrade Cheng Debao is just one of these many examples.
    Saving a patient who was on the verge of death from severe crushing injuries to almost all internal organs, fighting hard for more than half a month, overcoming numerous difficulties, finally preserving the patient's life, and enabling him to restore his ability to serve socialist construction – this can be said to be a miracle. The emergence of this miracle is a reflection of the continuous improvement of the political and ideological consciousness of the medical staff, the victory of the General Line, and the victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

    We Must Save Cheng Debao
    Comrade Cheng Debao is an advanced producer at the Hankou Second Loading and Unloading Station, a national red banner unit. On January 14th of this year, while working, he was crushed by a pile of seventeen-story high rice sacks weighing more than 3,000 kilograms that suddenly collapsed, and his injuries were extremely serious. When Cheng Debao was sent to the emergency room of the Second Affiliated Hospital, he was already in severe shock. In order to save the life of Comrade Cheng Debao, the hospital's Party General Branch immediately issued a call to the entire hospital: "We must save Comrade Cheng Debao!" This is the determination of the Party, and it is also the common aspiration of more than 20,000 workers at the Wuhan Second Loading and Unloading Station and all the comrades in the hospital. A rescue team was quickly organized and plunged into the battle. At that time, comrades from surgery, internal medicine, the laboratory, and radiology were involved in the rescue in the emergency room, together administering blood transfusions, injections, and oxygen. Dozens of medical workers fought hard for more than two hours for the life of a class brother, but the severe shock not only did not improve but continued to worsen. Massive blood transfusions, continuous infusions of norepinephrine, and repeated hypertonic glucose artery infusions had no effect, and the blood pressure only flickered around 50 mm Hg.

    It was very clear that if we continued to wait, the prolonged and severe shock would inevitably lead to death. What should we do? Could we perform surgery to rescue him? The general surgical practice is that, unless there is an open pneumothorax or a penetrating injury to the chest or abdomen with continuous internal bleeding causing the shock, it is generally advocated to correct the shock first and then perform surgery after the shock has initially improved. Performing emergency rescue surgery in a state of severe shock was a new problem, and many comrades felt unsure. In the face of this complex situation, everyone hesitated, unable to distinguish the direction to continue moving forward. At this critical juncture of life and death, the Party General Branch, following the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, correctly analyzed the situation and believed that the contradiction between life and death was the main contradiction at that time. Allowing the shock to worsen would inevitably lead to death. Breaking with convention and adopting rescue technical measures to fundamentally eliminate the cause of the shock could potentially allow the patient to be reborn from the edge of death. The Party promptly decided that it was necessary to break down superstitions, liberate thought, dare to think and dare to act, and immediately carry out surgical rescue. After careful analysis by everyone, it was believed that continuing conservative treatment held no hope for improvement, and it was decided to immediately perform surgical rescue.

    Facts proved that the Party's guiding ideology was correct. The course of the surgery showed that Comrade Cheng Debao, who had suffered severe crushing injuries, had complex and serious damage to his internal organs. The liver was ruptured, the intestine was ruptured, the mesentery and diaphragm were torn, the stomach and spleen were squeezed into the left chest cavity, the left lung was compressed into a small mass, the right femur and the left sixth rib were fractured, there was extensive bleeding behind the peritoneum, and the abdominal cavity was filled with food residue mixed with blood. Such a severe injury, as Professor Zhang Yuanjin said, "I have never seen it before, nor have I ever heard of it."

    The extremely complex surgery lasted for more than four hours and was successful. This was the first decisive victory in rescuing Cheng Debao and the first hurdle we overcame in the entire battle.

    Although the surgery was successful, the condition was still very dangerous. Two days after the surgery, severe uremia and acidosis developed. At this time, the patient was only producing an average of one drop of urine per minute, and Comrade Cheng Debao's life was once again in danger. After various treatments, this hurdle was overcome. Next was a week-long pneumonia and wound dehiscence. After the wound dehiscence, there was no time to move Cheng Debao to the operating room, so a second surgery was performed in the ward to re-suture the wound. This overcame another two difficulties.

    The work of rescuing Comrade Cheng Debao was far from over. On the twelfth day after the injury, there was massive vomiting of blood and bleeding in the stool, and his condition deteriorated sharply, with a drop in blood pressure and a sharp decrease in hemoglobin, resulting in another shock. The Party General Branch once again organized everyone to discuss the matter. The condition required us to find out the cause of the bleeding in order to eliminate it. In order to save the life of our class brother, the organization agreed with the opinion of everyone to perform a third surgery and decided to have the strongest lineup, with the main responsible doctors from six specialties participating in the surgery, anesthesia, and blood transfusion. This surgery lasted for more than four hours. The results of the surgery showed that the bleeding was caused by the peeling and shedding of a large area of gastric mucosa. During the surgery, some people thought, "This is the end"; others said, "The surgery is just doing everything humanly possible." However, the Party firmly encouraged and supported everyone to continue the rescue, and the bleeding was finally temporarily stopped. After that, there were two more episodes of gastric bleeding, and various measures were taken to stop them. In this way, Comrade Cheng Debao's precious life overcame another three hurdles and he survived.

    In the process of repeated bleeding, the doctors constantly discussed and studied treatment plans. At one consultation, a palliative conclusion was reached: the bleeding was stable, conservative treatment was to be used, and if there was further bleeding, surgery would be performed. At that time, the Party General Branch believed that it was not enough to reach this conclusion and that the cause of the gastric mucosal exfoliation and bleeding should be further analyzed, and the contradictions identified in order to further resolve them. After detailed discussion and analysis, the possibility of toxic and inflammatory causes was ruled out, and it was believed that the gastric mucosal exfoliation and bleeding were due to trauma. This conclusion was extremely beneficial because once the cause of the bleeding was identified, it would be possible to grasp the development of the condition and carry out treatment, laying the foundation for subsequent rescue work.

    The fourth major bleeding came more fiercely, and Comrade Cheng Debao became weaker and weaker, and the situation was very serious, with the rescue work facing the eighth hurdle. At this time, most people believed that it was a fantasy to hope that the bleeding would stop on its own and that the only option was to surgically remove the bleeding stomach in order to seize the last opportunity. Preparations for the surgery were already underway. The Party decided to convene a joint consultation of doctors of both traditional Chinese and Western medicine. During the consultation, the majority of people still tended towards surgery, and the person in charge also concluded: "Let's operate and seize the last opportunity." The Party General Branch once again studied the condition, analyzed the causes, and decided that not only must Cheng Debao be saved, but his labor power to serve socialist construction must also be preserved. The Party believed that Cheng Debao was already very weak and that major surgery was not appropriate. The Party proposed that integrated treatment combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine should be adopted. After discussion, the correctness of the Party's guiding ideology was once again grasped by the masses. Under the Party's enthusiastic encouragement, the old Chinese medicine practitioner, Mr. Song Zhizhen, contributed a good method for stopping bleeding. He believed that to stop bleeding, it was necessary to first "strengthen qi," and that "strengthening qi" must also stop bleeding, so "strengthening qi" and stopping bleeding must be carried out simultaneously. Integrated treatment involving both traditional Chinese and Western medicine was carried out with dialectical treatment, and the patient was given medication overnight, and the conventional dose was boldly broken, with doses exceeding the conventional dose being used. From that time on, the stool changed from black to yellow, and the bleeding stopped. Comrade Cheng Debao did not undergo surgery and overcame the eighth hurdle.

    These eight hurdles were all overcome one by one. Each hurdle was a battle between life and death. Among them, the most serious junctures were the surgical rescue in a state of severe shock and the fourth major gastric bleeding. It is not difficult to imagine that a patient with such severe injuries, who then encountered so many successive and dangerous complications, could not have been saved without the strong leadership of the Party organization, without the display of the spirit of daring to think and daring to act, and without the tremendous achievements that the ideological transformation of the medical staff had already made.

    Comrades, I am now reporting to you with great excitement that Comrade Cheng Debao is rapidly recovering his health. His appetite has greatly increased, he can walk in the garden with crutches, and he can even walk some distance without crutches. The fractured part of his femur is about to heal completely. It can be said with certainty that the day when Comrade Cheng Debao, who is eager to work, will continue to make contributions to the cause of socialist construction is not far away.

    What Force Saved Cheng Debao?
    What is the reason for creating miracles? What force saved Cheng Debao? I am a doctor who personally participated in the rescue work from beginning to end. In the process of rescue, I and other comrades contributed a share of our strength, and at the same time, I received an extremely profound communist ideological education. Here, I would like to talk about a few experiences in this thrilling battle.

    First, the leadership of the Party and putting politics in command is the fundamental guarantee for the final victory of the rescue work.

    Comrade Cheng Debao was saved by the Party, and the Party gave him a second life. I have this experience, and many old professors and many comrades say so, and the facts are exactly like this. Whenever there was a serious juncture of life and death, it was the Party that pointed out the correct direction, guided the masses to break through conventions, and created miracles; in the most difficult times, it was the Party's high sense of political responsibility that educated the masses and maximized the concentration and display of the wisdom of the masses. We personally experienced the truth that business must be commanded by politics.

    In the process of rescuing Comrade Cheng Debao, I also clearly realized the importance of the ideological transformation of intellectuals. The medical staff who participated in the rescue of Comrade Cheng Debao all had a good wish to save Comrade Cheng Debao. However, the ways of thinking and working were obviously different. Who was right and who was wrong? From the rescue process, it can be clearly seen that without correct positions, viewpoints, and methods, even with good wishes and excellent skills, it is often not possible to achieve the expected results from the wishes and skills, and even good things can be turned into bad things. When dealing with the shock, I thought that surgery could not be performed. But the Party decided to perform surgery. When dealing with stopping the bleeding, I thought that surgery was needed, but the Party disagreed with performing surgery. Facts proved that the Party was correct. It is very clear that the Party considers problems from a comprehensive perspective rather than from a local perspective. When dealing with the shock, it seizes the main contradiction of fighting for life. When bleeding, the Party does not unilaterally cut off the stomach to stop the bleeding, but considers it from the perspective of preserving Cheng Debao's life and also allowing him to live healthy and live happily. The Party treats problems from the interests of the working people in every aspect. The Party can grasp objective laws and recognize the possibility of spontaneous healing of traumatic bleeding, thus turning the patient from danger to safety. This made me more deeply realize why we should study the ideological methods of dialectical materialism. We cannot leave the Party for a moment. The Party not only points out the direction politically, but also points out the direction professionally, leading us in specific work at all times. The Party also points out new paths for us academically. The Party is the real expert. The deeds of rescuing Cheng Debao once again prove that the Party's leadership in scientific undertakings is correct. Living facts have educated me that I must follow the Party, rely closely on the Party, and that leaving the Party will lead to getting lost and will cause damage to the socialist cause. In the rescue of Cheng Debao, the Party's wise decisions, the Party's leadership in the cooperation of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, and the Party's mass line are precisely the sources of the miracle that the Cheng Debao case could create. Without the Party, Cheng Debao would have gone from "pseudo-death" to real death. With the Party, Cheng Debao would go from "pseudo-death" to real life. This is an absolutely true and irrefutable fact. It was the Party that gave Comrade Cheng Debao a second life, and it was the Party that cured the disease in my thinking. I deeply feel that politics can cure diseases.

    Secondly, the success of rescuing Cheng Debao is the result of implementing the Party's mass line and the result of communist collaboration.

    It is precisely because of the Party's unwavering mass viewpoint, believing in the masses and relying on the masses, that the wisdom and drive of the broad masses have been concentrated and displayed to the greatest extent, and the patient has been rescued with a more conscious labor attitude. Communist ideology is constantly growing. During Cheng Debao's severe bleeding, there was an urgent need for blood transfusions, but the blood bank's blood was used up. The hospital's doctors, nurses, administrative cadres, and workers all rushed to ask for blood donations. Although I had been working continuously for several days and nights and was very tired, in order to rescue my class brother, I resolutely extended my arm and asked the comrades in the blood bank to draw blood from me. Nurse Zhang Ruishan, who was thin and small, weighed only 41 kilograms. In order to achieve her wish to donate blood to Comrade Cheng Debao, she falsely reported her weight. A professor and medical staff member gave his blood to an ordinary worker whom he had never met before. This was impossible in the old society, but in our society, it has become an ordinary thing.

    In difficult days, when danger and illness repeatedly tortured Cheng Debao, the nurses tried every means to minimize his pain and paid attention to every detail. Comrade Lin Yuying constantly thought of ways and was always careful. For example, when feeding him, the patient wanted to eat more, and she also hoped that the patient could eat more, but considering that the severely damaged stomach and intestines could not eat too much at one time, she would rather feed him more times. Seeing that the condition improved, she was busy shaving the patient's beard. In the past, Comrade Lin Yuying thought that it was impossible to treat an unfamiliar patient as a relative, but today she has used practical actions to make Cheng Debao's lover call her a sister. Indeed, in our big family, in order to realize the common ideal of communism, hundreds of millions of working people have become a close-knit whole. The brother units in the hospital and the brother hospitals in the city said to us: "Whatever you need, we will give you." When we needed hemostatic agents, some units in other places rushed to have the medicines delivered by plane. Comrade Li Deyou of the General Affairs Section went to the city center blood bank in the middle of the night in the bone-chilling winter to get blood. When he came back, there was no car, so he ran more than a mile in one breath before he ran into a tricycle. When the tricycle worker heard that it was to save the life of a worker brother, he immediately pedaled quickly to the hospital. When one person is in trouble, ten thousand people help; when one place is in difficulty, support comes from all directions. This communist ideology has produced unparalleled material strength. The miracle of rescuing Cheng Debao is a communist triumphal song that resounds through the sky.

    Third, the victory of rescuing Cheng Debao shows that as long as we break down superstitions, liberate our minds, and combine traditional Chinese and Western medicine for integrated treatment, we can create miracles.

    Can surgery be performed in a state of severe shock? Should surgery be performed? This was the first problem that was raised to us when rescuing Cheng Debao. If our hands and feet were bound by general conventions, we would only have to let the shock worsen to death. The inability to perform surgery in a state of severe shock is applicable in general situations. Comrade Cheng Debao's situation at that time was a special situation, and it was necessary to analyze it specifically and take special rescue measures. Moreover, under today's scientific and technological conditions, especially under the decisive conditions of new people with communist ideology, past conventions are not insurmountable. Facts have shown that as long as we analyze things according to their objective laws and draw correct conclusions, we can break with old conventions and create miracles.

    After the trauma, large areas of gastric mucosa peeled off. After so many times of stopping the bleeding, twelve hemostatic drugs were used and the bleeding did not stop. However, the joint consultation of traditional Chinese and Western medicine and the integrated treatment stopped the fierce bleeding, and the medicine of the motherland emitted dazzling light here. Before this, we surgeons had also used some traditional Chinese medicines, but the effect was not significant, but this time it had such a remarkable effect. This is because we did not grasp the method of dialectical treatment in the past. The combination of "strengthening qi" and stopping bleeding resulted in the blood being stopped. Some people thought that stopping it was a fantasy, but traditional Chinese medicine turned the fantasy into reality. This profoundly educated us that we must study traditional Chinese medicine theory well and systematically, accept the treatment experience of traditional Chinese medicine, and strive to sort it out and improve it to establish a new school of medicine.

    Hold High the Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought - All Work Can Continue to Develop by Leaps and Bounds
    In the first quarter of this year, under the leadership of the Party, we successively rescued some similar critically ill patients. These included people with severe craniocerebral trauma and large-area burns. Even during the same period, it was necessary to organize several special rescue teams to carry out rescues. For example, there was a patient who injured the large intestine, small intestine, bladder, and ureter. Although the condition was very serious, because their minds were liberated and superstitions were broken, the surgeons exceptionally performed a large intestine, small intestine, and bladder resection and repair, and ureteral transplantation, which finally brought the patient out of danger. A patient with tetanus was comatose and had spasms for as long as 27 days. During this time, he also experienced generalized edema, acidosis, and pneumonia, and experienced four sudden stops in breathing. Because the medical staff always maintained a high degree of vigilance, despite the dangerous situations, he was finally rescued.

    The success of rescuing Cheng Debao and other comrades is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought and the victory of the General Line. The Cheng Debao case would not have been possible before liberation. But today, if we did not have the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, it would also be difficult for us to succeed in rescuing him. Without the leadership of the Party, without the guidance of dialectical materialism, without the courage to break with conventions, without the spirit of selfless labor and mutual cooperation, and without a high sense of political responsibility to the working people, Cheng Debao and other comrades could not be treated.

    The Cheng Debao incident has more profoundly educated us that we must study Mao Zedong Thought well and hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher. Only then can all our work achieve continuous leaps and bounds. This is our most fundamental experience.

    Dear representatives, our work is still not good enough, and there are still many shortcomings. We sincerely hope that the comrades will give us criticism and help. This conference is a very good learning opportunity for us. We must humbly learn from the representatives and promote our work rapidly to meet the requirements of the Party and the people.

    党领导我们创造了奇迹
    武汉医学院第二附属医院外科教研组代表　童尔昌
    我代表武汉医学院第二附属医院外科教研组，向首长们、同志们汇报抢救阶级兄弟成德保的战斗经过。
    在六十年代的第一个春天，武汉医学院附属第二医院外科教研组的同志们，先后抢救了许多危重病人，抢救成德保同志的胜利，就是这许多事例中的一个。
    抢救一个几乎全部内脏严重压伤，濒于死亡的病人，苦战半个多月，闯过重重难关，终于保存了病人的生命，并且使他能够恢复为社会主义建设服务的劳动能力，这不能不说是一个奇迹。这个奇迹的出现，是医护同志政治思想觉悟不断提高的反映，是总路线的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利。
    一定要救活成德保
    成德保同志是全国红旗单位汉口装卸二站的先进生产者。他在今年元月14日工作的时候，被突然倒塌的十七层高、重达三千多斤的米袋堆压倒，伤势非常严重。当成德保被送到第二附属医院的急诊室的时候，已经是处于严重的休克状态了。为了抢救成德保同志的生命，医院党总支立即向全院发出了战斗的号召：“一定要救活成德保同志！”这是党的决心，也是武汉市装卸二站两万多工人和全院同志的共同愿望。一个抢救小组迅速组织起来，投入了战斗。当时在急诊间进行抢救的有外科、内科、检验科、放射科等单位的同志，一起输血、打针、接氧气。几十个医务工作者为了一个阶级兄弟的生命，艰苦奋战了两个多小时，严重的休克，不但没有好转，而且不断恶化。大量输血，持续滴注正肾上腺素，反复高渗葡萄糖液动脉输入，都没有任何反应，血压只在五十毫米水银柱那里跳动一下。
    十分明显，如果继续等待下去，长期严重的休克，必然导致死亡。怎么办？能不能进行手术抢救？一般外科的常规是，除非有开放性气胸或胸腹部穿透伤有持续内出血等引起的休克外，都主张先纠正休克，在休克有初步的好转后，才进行手术。在严重休克状态下施行紧急的抢救手术，这是一个新的问题，不少同志感到没有把握。大家在这种复杂的情况面前，犹豫徘徊起来，不能辨别继续前进的方向。在这个生死关头，党总支遵循着毛泽东思想的指导，正确地分析了情况，认为生死矛盾是当时的主要矛盾，听任休克恶化，必然带来死亡，打破常规采取抢救的技术措施，从根本上消除造成休克的原因，就有可能使病人从死亡边缘获得再生。党及时决定，必须破除迷信，解放思想，敢想敢做，立刻进行手术抢救。经过大家仔细分析，认为继续进行保守治疗没有好转的希望，决定立即手术抢救。
    事实证明了党的指导思想是正确的，手术的经过表明，遭受严重压伤的成德保同志，内脏器官的损伤是复杂而严重的。肝破裂了，肠破裂了，肠系膜及横膈膜撕裂了，胃及脾被挤进了左胸腔，左肺被压缩成一小团，右侧股骨与左侧第六肋骨被压断，腹膜后广泛渗血，腹腔内充满了食物残渣并混有血液。这样严重的伤势，正如章元瑾教授所说的：“看也没有看到过，听也没有听到过。”
    极其复杂的手术进行了四个多小时，获得了成功。这是抢救成德保的第一个决定性的胜利，也是我们在整个战斗过程中闯过的第一道难关。
    手术虽然成功了，但是病情仍然非常险恶。手术以后两天，发生了严重的尿毒症，酸中毒。这时，平均一分钟只有一滴尿，成德保同志的生命又陷于危险之中。经过多方救治，这一关闯过了。接着又是绵延达一个星期的肺炎和创口崩裂。创口崩裂后，来不及把成德保抬到手术室，就在病房里进行了第二次手术，将创口重新缝合。这就又闯过了两重难关。
    抢救成德保同志的工作，远还没有结束，在受伤后的第十二天，发生了大量的呕血和大便出血，病情急剧地恶化，血压降低，血色素也猛烈下降，又是一次休克。党总支又一次组织大家讨论。病情需要我们弄清出血的原因，从而消灭出血。为了抢救阶级兄弟的生命，组织上同意了大家进行第三次手术的意见，并且决定以最强的阵容，由六个专科的主要负责医生参加手术、麻醉和输血。这次手术前后达四个多小时。手术的结果表明，出血是大片胃粘膜的剥离、脱落所造成。在手术中有的人想，“这一下完了”；又有人说，“手术是尽尽人事而已”。但是，党却坚定地鼓励和支持大家继续进行抢救，出血终于暂时停止。以后又继续发生了两次胃出血，都采取了各种措施止住。这样，成德保同志宝贵的生命又闯过了三个关口，活了下来。
    在反复出血的过程中，医生们不断地讨论、研究治疗方案。一次会诊会上，作出了姑息性的结论：出血稳定，保守治疗，若再出血，便进行手术。当时，党总支认为得出这个结论是不够的，应该进一步分析引起胃粘膜剥脱和出血的原因，找出矛盾，才能进一步解决矛盾。大家又经过详细的讨论和分析，排除了中毒性和发炎性原因的可能，认为胃粘膜剥脱和出血是由于创伤所致。这个结论是极其有益的，因为出血原因肯定了，就能够掌握病情发展规律进行治疗，为以后的抢救工作奠定了基础。
    第四次大出血来得更凶险，成德保同志愈来愈衰弱了，情况十分严重，抢救工作面临第八道难关。这时，多数人认为希望出血自行停止是幻想，只能手术切掉出血的胃脏，以争取最后的机会。手术的准备工作已经在进行。党决定召集中西医大会诊，会诊中大多数人的意见仍然是趋向于手术，主持的人也下了结论：“手术吧，争取最后的机会。”党总支又一次研究了病情，分析了原因，决定不仅要救活成德保，而且还必须保存他为社会主义建设服务的劳动力。党认为，成德保已经十分虚弱，作大手术是不适当的。党提出应当采用中西医结合进行综合治疗。经过讨论，党的指导思想的正确性，再一次为群众所掌握。在党的热情鼓励下，老中医宋之祯先生献出了止血良法。他认为止血必先“固气”，“固气”也必须止血，因而“固气”、止血要同时进行。中西医共同进行辩证论治的综合治疗，连夜给病人进药，并且大胆地打破常规，应用超出常规的剂量。从那时开始，大便由黑到黄，血止住了。成德保同志没有开刀，闯过了第八道难关。
    这八道难关都被一一攻克了，每一道关口，都是生与死的搏斗。其中，最严重的关头是在严重休克情况下进行手术抢救和第四次胃大出血。不难想像，伤势如此严重的病人，又连续遇到这么多次接踵而来的险恶的并发症，如果没有党组织的坚强领导，如果不是发挥了敢想敢做的共产主义精神，如果不是医护人员思想改造已经取得了巨大的成果，是无法挽救成德保的生命的。
    同志们，现在我以十分兴奋的心情向大家报告，成德保同志正在迅速地恢复健康。他的食量大增，能够扶着拐杖到花园散步，还能离开拐杖走一些路，他的股骨骨折部分即将完全长牢。可以肯定地说，渴望着劳动的成德保同志为社会主义建设事业继续作出贡献的日子，已经不远了。
    是什么力量救活了成德保
    创造奇迹的原因在哪里？是什么力量救活了成德保？我是自始至终亲自参加抢救工作的医生，在抢救的过程中我和其他同志一样尽了一份力量，同时又受到一次极为深刻的共产主义思想教育。这里，我愿意谈一谈在这次惊心动魄的战斗中的几点体会。
    首先，党的领导，政治挂帅，是抢救工作获得最后胜利的根本保证。
    成德保同志是党救活的，是党给予他第二次生命。我有这样的体会，许多老教授和许多同志都这样说，事实也正是如此。每当生死存亡的严重关头，是党指出了正确的方向，引导群众冲破陈规，创造了奇迹；在最困难的时候，是党的高度政治责任感教育了群众，最大限度地集中和发挥了群众的智慧。我们亲身体会到业务必须由政治来统帅这样一条真理。
    在抢救成德保同志的过程中，还使我清楚地认识到知识分子思想改造的重要性。参加抢救成德保同志的医护人员，都有一个良好的愿望，要救活成德保同志。但是思想方法和工作方法却显然不同。究竟谁是谁非呢？从抢救过程中，可以清楚地看出，如果没有正确的立场、观点、方法，即使有良好的愿望和出色的技术，也往往不能使愿望和技术得到预期的结果，甚至于会把好事变成坏事。在处理休克时，我认为不能施行手术。而党却决定施行手术，在处理止血时，我认为需要手术，而党却又不同意施行手术。事实证明，党是正确的。事情很明显，党考虑问题是从全面而不是从局部出发，在处理休克时，抓住争夺生命的主要矛盾，在出血的时候，党不是片面地为止血而切除胃，而是从保全成德保的生命，同时还要让他生活得健康，生活得幸福。党对待问题处处是从劳动人民的利益来考虑的。党能抓住客观规律，认识到创伤出血自愈的可能性，因而使病人转危为安。这使我更深地体会到为什么要学习辩证唯物主义的思想方法。我们一刻都不能离开党，党不仅在政治上指出方向，在业务上也指出方向，无时无刻地在具体工作中领导我们。党在学术上也为我们指出新的道路，党才是真正的内行。抢救成德保的事迹又一次证明，党领导科学事业的正确。活生生的事实教育了我，我一定要跟着党走，紧紧地依靠党，离开党就会迷失方向，就会给社会主义事业带来损害。在对成德保的抢救中，党的英明决定，党领导的中西医合作，党的群众路线，正是成德保事例能创造奇迹的源泉。没有党，成德保会从“假死”到真死，有了党，成德保就会从“假死”到真活，这是千真万确无可辩驳的事实。是党给了成德保同志第二次生命，是党治好了我思想上的病，我深深地感到，政治是能治病的。
    其次，抢救成德保的成功，是贯彻党的群众路线的结果，是共产主义大协作的结果。
    正是由于党的坚定不移的群众观点，相信群众，依靠群众，这才最大限度地集中和发挥了广大群众的智慧和干劲，用更加自觉的劳动态度来抢救病人。共产主义思想不断成长，在成德保严重出血期间，迫切需要输血，可是血库的血用完了。医院的医生、护士、行政干部、工友，人人都争先恐后地来要求献血。我虽然已经连续几昼夜工作，十分疲倦，但是，为了抢救自己的阶级弟兄，我毅然伸出了自己的手臂，要血库的同志在我身上抽血。又瘦又小的护士张瑞珊同志，体重只有四十一公斤，为了达到献血给成德保同志的志愿，谎报了自己的体重。一个教授、医务人员，把自己的鲜血，献给一个从不相识的普通工人，这在旧社会是不可能的；而在我们这个社会，却变成一件普通的事情。
    在艰苦的日子里，当一次又一次的危险、病痛折磨侵袭成德保的时候，护士们千方百计地设法使他尽量减少痛苦，注意着每一个细节。林玉英同志不断地想办法，处处留神，譬如喂饮食，病人很想多吃一些，她也希望病人能够多吃一些，但考虑到受过严重损伤的肠胃不能一次吃得太饱时，她就宁愿多喂几次。看到病情一好转，她便忙着替病人剃胡子。过去林玉英同志认为把不认识的病人当亲人，是不可能的，但今天却以实际的行动，使成德保的爱人称她为亲姊妹。的确，在我们的大家庭里，为了实现共产主义的共同理想，亿万劳动人民成为一个亲密无间的整体。院内各兄弟单位和市内的各兄弟医院，对我们说：“你们需要什么，我们就给什么。”当我们需要止血剂时，外地有的单位赶忙把药品交飞机运来。总务科的李德友同志在寒风刺骨的冬天里，半夜到市中心血库取血，回来时没有车，一口气跑了一里多路，才碰上一辆三轮车，当三轮车工人听说是为了抢救一个工人弟兄的生命，就立刻飞快地踏奔医院。一人有事，万人相助，一处有难，八方支援，这种共产主义的思想，产生了无比的物质力量。抢救成德保的奇迹，就是一曲响彻云霄的共产主义凯歌。
    第三，抢救成德保的胜利说明了，只要破除迷信，解放思想，中西医结合综合治疗，就能够创造奇迹。
    严重休克的情况下能不能手术？应不应该手术？这是抢救成德保时向我们提出的第一个难题。如果被一般成规束缚了手脚，只有听任休克恶化以致死亡。严重休克的情况下不能手术，在一般的情况下是适用的。成德保同志当时的情况，是一种特殊情况，必须加以具体分析，采取特殊的抢救措施。而且，在今天的科学技术条件下，特别是具有共产主义思想的新人的决定条件下，过去的常规就不是不能够逾越的了。事实说明了，只要我们根据事物的客观规律加以分析，得出正确的结论，就可以打破旧常规，创造出奇迹。
    创伤后大片胃粘膜脱落，这样多次的止血，用了十二种止血药物没有止住，而中西医共同会诊，综合治疗止住了猛烈的出血，祖国的医学在这里发出了夺目的光芒。在这以前，我们外科医生也曾经用过一些中药，效果不显著，而这一次却有这样卓越的神效。这是因为过去没有掌握辩证论治的方法。用“固气”及止血相结合，结果血止住了。有些人认为要止住是幻想，而祖国医学把幻想变成了现实。这就深刻地教育了我们，要好好地系统学习中医理论，接受祖国医学的治疗经验，加以整理提高为建立新医学派而奋斗。
    高举毛泽东思想红旗  一切工作可以不断飞跃发展
    今年第一季度，在党的领导下我们先后抢救过类似的一些危重病人。其中包括有严重的颅脑外伤和大面积烧伤的人。甚至于在同一个时期内，要组织几个专门的抢救小组来进行抢救。如有一个伤了大肠、小肠、膀胱、输尿管的病人，虽然病情非常严重，但是由于解放了思想，破除了迷信，外科医师们破例地施行了一次大肠、小肠、膀胱的切除及修补、输尿管移植术，终于使病人脱离了险境。一位破伤风的病人昏迷而有痉挛长达二十七天，中间还发生过全身水肿、酸中毒、肺炎，并且发生过四次呼吸突然停止，由于医护同志们经常保持着高度警惕性，尽管险象丛生，但终于被抢救过来了。
    抢救成德保等同志的成功，是毛泽东思想的胜利，是总路线的胜利。抢救成德保事例，在解放前当然是不可能出现的。但是今天如果没有毛泽东思想的指导，我们要想抢救成功也将是困难的。没有党的领导，没有辩证唯物主义思想的指导，没有敢于破除常规的思想，没有忘我的劳动、相互协作的精神，没有对劳动人民的高度政治责任感，成德保等同志是治不了的。
    通过成德保事件，更深刻地教育了我们，必须好好地学习毛泽东思想，更高地举起毛泽东思想的红旗，我们的一切工作，才能获得不断地飞跃发展，这是我们最根本的体会。
    各位代表，我们的工作做得还很不够，存在的缺点还很多，我们诚恳地希望同志们给予我们批评与帮助。这次大会对我们是一次很好的学习机会，我们一定要虚心向各位代表学习，把我们的工作迅速向前推进，以符合党和人民对我们的要求。
