    One Tree Blooms with Two Flowers
    The Pinyin alphabet is a great method,
    One tree blooms with two flowers,
    One flower removes the illiteracy cap,
    One flower learns Mandarin Chinese.
    —Cheng Shuqian
    Editor's Note: Cheng Shuqian is from Qingge Village, Wanrong County. She is 47 years old this year, of poor peasant background. After becoming literate through Pinyin, she continuously read dozens of Pinyin books. Even when sick in bed, she still reads. People call her a "learning fanatic." She said, "Reading has become an addiction; if I don't read for a day, it feels like I haven't eaten." She now recognizes 2,500 characters and has created more than 600 poems, and has written short plays such as "Comparison of the Old and New Societies," "An Old Couple's Quarrel," and "Advising Sister-in-law to Study Culture." She also said, "Removing the illiteracy cap opened my mind and made me smarter. As soon as I see something new, I want to write a poem about it"; and that "From the bottom of my heart, I feel like I'm getting younger and younger, and I've become fond of singing and dancing."

    一树开下两朵花
    拼音字母好办法，
    一树开下两朵花，
    一朵摘掉文盲帽，
    一朵学会普通话。
