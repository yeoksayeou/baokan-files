The rice transplanter is being widely promoted in rice-growing areas across the country. Seven types have been finalized for promotion: Hunan Liling No. 2, Jiangxi Type 59, Guangxi Type 59-3, Shanghai Nanhui No. 1, Hubei Hanchuan Type 59, Zhejiang Nongsi No. 4, and Nan 105-B. Fourteen types are recommended for trial use nationwide. Farmers love rice transplanters and are eager to use them. This is a great revolution in paddy field operations, and it is a very encouraging thing.

Machine-transplanted rice not only improves work efficiency but also increases production compared to hand transplanting.

Using rice transplanters for transplanting not only meets agricultural technical requirements but also improves work efficiency by several, dozens, or even scores of times compared to hand transplanting, and it generally achieves good results in increasing production. According to surveys in Guizhou Province and Liuzhou and Nanning in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, machine-transplanted rice fields yielded 5% to 20% more than hand-transplanted rice fields last year. According to statistics from comparative experiments at fourteen points in Guizhou, Hunan, Sichuan, Anhui, Hubei, Jiangxi, Hebei, and other provinces, six points showed a yield increase of 2% to 10% with machine transplanting compared to hand transplanting, four points showed an increase of 11% to 20%, and four points showed an increase of 21% to 35%.

Why can machine-transplanted rice increase production? According to the comparative experimental materials from various places, there are roughly the following factors:

I. Uniform row spacing can ensure reasonable close planting. This is the most important factor in the increased yield of machine transplanting compared to hand transplanting. Machine transplanting can maximize the number of rows and seedlings per mu and ensure even distribution. This can not only increase the number of basic seedlings per mu but also allow each row and seedling to have a certain range for absorbing nutrients, and the upper part has better ventilation and light transmission, thereby ensuring the normal growth and development of all seedlings. This is impossible with hand transplanting. Rice is a self-pollinating plant, and machine-transplanted seedlings grow neatly, and the flowering period is consistent, which can improve the fertilization rate and extend the grain-filling period, increase the number of effective grains, and make the grains full, reducing empty shells and shriveled grains. The survey by the Youth All-Purpose Farm of Jiangkou Commune in Tongren County, Guizhou Province, proved that last year, machine-transplanted rice had 33,000 rows per mu, while hand-transplanted rice had only more than 21,000 rows. Machine transplanting had more than one-third more rows than hand transplanting. According to a specific survey of several plots of land by the working group of the Tongren County Committee of the Communist Party of China, hand transplanting was used in 1958, and machine transplanting was used in 1959. The results showed that machine transplanting had 17.8% more rows and 18% more basic seedlings than hand transplanting, and the yield in 1959 increased by 38% to 42% compared to 1958. Of course, the increase in production cannot be attributed to machine transplanting alone but is the result of a combination of factors. However, the fact that machine transplanting increased production compared to hand transplanting in fertile fields, poor fields, and general fields fully demonstrates the superiority of machine transplanting.

Comparing the growth and development of machine-transplanted seedlings and hand-transplanted seedlings, machine-transplanted seedlings return to green quickly, grow well, and mature early. Observations by the Youth Farm of Jiangkou Commune in Tongren County, Guizhou Province, proved that machine-transplanted seedlings can return to green in four or five days, which is three or four days faster than hand-transplanted seedlings. Effective tillering, plant height, panicle length, and the number of grains per panicle are all higher than those of hand-transplanted seedlings.

II. Machine-transplanted seedlings have four characteristics: "loose, shallow, even, and dense." Loose: The transplanter uses seedling claws to separate the seedlings, and the seedlings are loosely inserted into the field row by row, in a "fan shape," without heart-wrapped seedlings. The seedling roots are stretched, which is conducive to the balanced development of the seedlings. Hand-transplanted seedlings are mostly "single-stalk incense," with the outer seedlings developing well and tillering early, while the middle heart-wrapped seedlings do not get enough sunlight, tiller less, and gradually decline. Machine-transplanted seedlings do not cause the phenomenon of seedlings crowding each other or seedlings bullying seedlings. Shallow means that the depth of the seedlings into the mud is shallow. According to surveys in various places, the depth of machine-transplanted seedlings into the mud is about four centimeters, and the deepest does not exceed five centimeters. This can make the seedlings develop consistently. Because the surface soil is soft and the temperature is high, it can promote early return to green and early tillering of the seedlings. Even: Machine-transplanted seedlings are not only uniform in row spacing but also uniform in depth. This prevents the uneven growth and development between rows and plants, resulting in early tillering for those that develop quickly and difficult early tillering for those that develop slowly, thus affecting yield. Observations by the Youth Farm of Jiangkou Commune show that third-class seedlings generally account for 5% to 20% in hand-transplanted rice fields, while third-class seedlings in machine-transplanted rice fields account for less than 5% at most. Dense: Machine-transplanted seedlings are dense and uniform, and coupled with rapid tillering, they can inhibit late ineffective tillering. Hand-transplanted seedlings are sparse and uneven, and early effective tillering is also uneven, making it impossible to inhibit late tillering, thus reducing yield. Observations by the Youth Farm of Jiangkou Commune show that ineffective tillering of machine-transplanted seedlings is generally around 5%, while it is mostly above 10% for hand transplanting.

III. Machine transplanting has high work efficiency and can seize the season. Rice transplanting has strict requirements for agricultural timing, generally requiring completion within ten days. Delaying the time will reduce production. At the same time, transplanting has high labor intensity and requires a lot of labor. Since the Great Leap Forward in agriculture, the density of transplanting has increased, and the amount of labor used has also increased. Therefore, seizing the transplanting season is even more important. For example, Dong'an Commune in Cangwu County, Guangxi, planted more than 60,000 mu of early rice last year and this year. Last year, it all relied on hand transplanting, which took more than half a month. This year, it used 376 transplanters, and 24 production teams completed transplanting in six days. The entire commune only needs ten days to complete the early rice transplanting task. Machine-transplanted seedlings not only seize the season but also return to green quickly, grow well, and mature early, thereby correspondingly reducing the harm of natural disasters.

Based on the analysis of many facts above, it can be affirmed that machine transplanting is an important factor in increasing rice production.

The reasons for the increased production of machine-transplanted rice are multifaceted. Although some still need to be further observed and analyzed to draw more comprehensive and scientific conclusions, the widespread increase in production of machine-transplanted rice is an ironclad fact. It shows that the creation and promotion of transplanters have very important significance.

The process of creating rice transplanters is a struggle between two lines.

Rice transplanting is an excellent cultivation technique in the traditional intensive farming of our country. Transplanting techniques require high skills and have high labor intensity. For thousands of years, farmers in paddy field areas have always felt that transplanting is an extremely arduous task. A folk song in Hunan vividly depicts the suffering of hand transplanting, saying: "Hand transplanting is unspeakable suffering, facing the mud and back to the sky, sore waist and back and broken hands, it is difficult to transplant three fen of land in a day." According to historical records, there was a "seedling horse" in Wuchang, Hubei during the Song Dynasty, which was an auxiliary tool for transplanting. People could sit on it to transplant seedlings and reduce the pain of bending over. However, under the feudal rule at that time, it could only be a flash in the pan and was not passed down. After the liberation of the whole country, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of working people for production was unprecedentedly high. In order to rapidly increase production and reduce the physical labor intensity of transplanting, they put forward the requirement of creating transplanters, and in many areas, they also carried out attempts to create transplanters. This demand and attempt of the masses of farmers, under the attention and active leadership of the Party, rapidly formed a technical revolution movement to create transplanters. The experimental research on rice transplanters began to develop gradually from nothing, from low-level to high-level.

In the autumn of 1955, Kuang Liang (transferred serviceman) of the Huazhong Agricultural Science Research Institute, with the strong support of the Party, began research on the seedling dividing mechanism of transplanters, and successively designed and trial-produced more than a dozen seedling dividing mechanisms, carried out hundreds of experiments, and initially found a reasonable seedling dividing method. At the same time, Comrade Lin Tiqiang, a scientific worker of peasant origin, under the leadership and support of the Party, analyzed and studied the characteristics of seedlings and carried out the design and experiment of transplanters. In just a few months, the key problems of seedling dividing and transplanting were solved. In February 1956, the prototype of China's first rice transplanter – a single-row rolling transplanter with a comb claw longitudinal pulling seedling dividing pressure seedling sending mechanism – appeared at the National Paddy Field Agricultural Implement Symposium held in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, and made a practical demonstration, proving that seedlings could be inserted into the field. This was a valuable attempt. Since then, this nascent sprout, under the cultivation and nurturing of the Party, has continued to develop and grow rapidly with vigorous vitality. In the four years up to February this year, seven national professional meetings have been held successively. Various places have also held more professional meetings for this purpose. In the improvement and upgrading of transplanters, each meeting achieved significant achievements, and the forms were diverse, and the models and materials were adapted to local conditions, truly a hundred flowers blossomed, and all colors were resplendent. At the fourth meeting in 1957, the machines participating in the meeting included Nan 102, Nan 103, Huazhong direct insertion type, Yanbian clip insertion type, Nan Nong disc type, Nan Gong shovel type, Gong Nong brand direct insertion type, Hunan Agricultural Machinery Factory rolling insertion type, and Tianjin Yangliuqing Iron Factory rolling insertion type, a total of nine types, and the number of models was greatly increased compared with the first, second, and third meetings. By the fifth meeting in September 1958, the number of participating machines reached 41; at the sixth meeting in June 1959, the number of machines present was 63; and at the seventh meeting in February this year, it reached 84. This fact shows that the creation of transplanters has been able to achieve significant results in a relatively short period of time because it quickly formed a mass movement.

However, the process of creating transplanters was not smooth sailing. It experienced various struggles with conservatives. At the beginning of the creation of transplanters, some people determined that machine transplanting was impossible, spread the argument that "transplanting cannot be mechanized," and poured cold water on this new thing. For example, at the third transplanter on-site meeting in April 1957, although the transplanter had been greatly improved compared with the first prototype produced in 1956, due to the fact that missed transplanting, snagging, and seedling damage were still quite serious at that time, and the machine body was still relatively heavy and the operation was not very convenient, the conservatives seized on the inevitable shortcomings of this new thing when it was just budding and made accusations and attacks. Comrade Lin Tiqiang's creative research activities were subjected to all kinds of difficulties by some bourgeois intellectuals. At that time, a rightist in the Agricultural Implement Department of the East China Agricultural Science Research Institute also attempted to stifle this new thing and wanted to cancel the research project on transplanters. However, the Party gave great encouragement and support to all transplanter creators and launched a serious criticism of bourgeois ideological viewpoints. Therefore, the research work on transplanters was not obstructed but instead developed more and more deeply from the struggle. The transplanter initially created by Comrade Lin Tiqiang and others quickly evolved from "Nan 101" to the current "Nan 105B type," reaching the standard of finalization.

In the process of creating transplanters, some people also believed that transplanters had been studied for decades in some capitalist countries where agricultural mechanization work started much earlier than in our country, such as Italy and Japan, but they had not succeeded. Our country has backward technology, and it is even more impossible to succeed. The Party also launched a resolute struggle against this slavish ideology in a timely manner and thoroughly criticized the research methods of a few bourgeois technical personnel who completely copied books, divorced from production, and divorced from reality. At the same time, the Party mobilized the broad masses of workers and peasants to boldly create from production practice and launched a mass movement to create transplanters. Because we have the leadership of the Communist Party and the incomparably superior socialist system, problems that capitalist countries cannot solve quickly can be solved quickly in our socialist country.

One of the mistakes of people holding bourgeois views is not believing in the masses. Some people once believed that transplanters were a cutting-edge technology, and it was impossible for workers and peasants to climb this scientific peak. In fact, the creators of transplanters today are mostly workers and peasants, and it is precisely they who first solved the technical difficulties such as seedling dividing and transplanting. For example, Comrade Lin Tiqiang found a method of dividing seedlings by using the movement of the seedling box from the equidistant movement principle of typewriters. Comrade He Jisheng was inspired by the comb and designed a clamp-type seedling dividing mechanism, successfully creating a Liling simple transplanter. Numerous facts prove that the working masses have infinite creative talents. It is precisely because of the bold creation of the broad masses of workers and peasants that our transplanters have a variety of models, some are native, some are foreign, and some are semi-native and semi-foreign. Each province has its own, which can be selected and promoted by various regions according to different conditions and needs. The reason why workers and peasants have infinite creative talents is that they are practitioners of production and have the most profound and richest practical production knowledge; it is that under the leadership of the Party, they have embarked on the road of liberating themselves and have a high degree of socialist and communist consciousness. At the same time, they have indomitable perseverance, can learn humbly, and are not afraid of failure and losing face, making persistent efforts and persevering to the end.

The process of creating transplanters in our country is a process of fierce struggle between two lines. The successful creation of transplanters in our country is the victory of the Party's general line, the victory of the mass technological innovation and technological revolution movement under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, and the victory of the great leap forward and the great power of the people's commune.

The significance of rice transplanters for accelerating agricultural mechanization in our country

The successful research and popularization of rice transplanters not only plays a very huge role in the current great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production but also has a very far-reaching significance for accelerating the realization of agricultural mechanization in our country.

This year, the country plans to promote about 4.5 million transplanters, which is an encouraging plan. According to this plan, we can calculate several accounts: First, about 70% of rice fields (about 350 million mu) will be machine-transplanted; second, if we calculate saving two labor days per mu, the country can save about 700 million labor days in rice transplanting alone, which not only greatly alleviates the contradiction of insufficient labor force in the "double rush" season in the vast paddy field areas but also can use a large amount of labor saved in other production aspects, promoting the overall development of industrial and agricultural production; third, machine transplanting guarantees quality and can increase production. If we calculate increasing rice production by 10 jin per mu, it is a very large number.

The large-scale promotion of transplanters also means that the operation of rice transplanting in our country is beginning to leap from manual operation to a brand-new stage of semi-mechanization and mechanization and automation. It can be said that it is a great revolution in paddy field agricultural implements in our country and the starting point of paddy field mechanization in our country.

The main purpose of realizing agricultural mechanization in many countries in the world is to solve the problem of labor shortage. However, in our country, it has two important meanings. It can not only solve the problem of labor but also can better implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture and lay the foundation for solving the problem of mechanization of garden fields; this is of great significance for carrying forward the excellent tradition of intensive farming of our country's farmers and continuously improving the yield per unit area.

The rice planting area in our country accounts for about one-fourth of the country's cultivated land, of which only a small part is direct seeding, and most areas adopt the method of transplanting. Because transplanting can grow two or three crops in a year, economically utilize land, increase the multiple cropping index, and transplanting can also achieve reasonable close planting and reduce weeds in the field. Therefore, the successful creation of rice transplanters is also different from general tool reforms. It has established a good model for the agricultural mechanization of intensive farming in our country. The continuous improvement and upgrading of transplanters will inevitably accelerate the realization of mechanized paddy field farming.

In the double-cropping rice areas, an important experience to ensure rice harvest is: "Early yellow, late green." These four characters fully illustrate that to meet the requirements of intensive farming, rushing to harvest and rush to transplant is an extremely important link. Generally, the time for late rice to mature and be harvested should not exceed after the Frost's Descent solar term. Due to the needs of the plant growth period, it is required to complete the transplanting of late rice seedlings before the Beginning of Autumn solar term. The experiment conducted by the Jiaxing Prefectural Agricultural Bureau of Zhejiang Province in 1956 proved that the earlier the late rice is transplanted, the better the harvest. Generally, those transplanted 18 days before the Beginning of Autumn solar term have a yield of about 500 jin per mu, which is about twice as high as those transplanted two days after the Beginning of Autumn solar term.

The survey of Anhui Province in the same year showed that a part of the continuous late rice was transplanted after the Limits of Heat solar term or even the White Dew solar term. Because the growing period was not enough, it led to crop failure. These examples show that mechanized paddy field farming, especially the mechanization of rice transplanting and rice harvesting, has a particularly important role in promoting the sustained leap forward in production in paddy field areas.

In the realization of agricultural mechanization in our country, the mechanization of paddy fields and mountainous areas is a more complex and arduous task, and transplanting is a link in the mechanization of paddy fields that has high technical requirements and is relatively difficult to solve. Therefore, the promotion of transplanters not only opens up a smooth road for the mechanization of paddy fields but also will encourage the broad masses to actively carry out the mechanization of plains, hills, and mountainous areas, thereby comprehensively accelerating the realization of agricultural mechanization in our country.

Strive to continuously improve the level of transplanters and innovate paddy field operation machinery

Currently, rice transplanters in our country have entered a new stage of finalization and promotion. However, there is still a considerable arduous process away from fully realizing mechanized paddy field farming. Even in the operation of rice transplanting, it is only beginning to enter the stage of semi-mechanization, and there is still much work that must be further completed in a timely manner. Therefore, it is necessary to seriously do a series of ideological and organizational work for the transplanters that are being widely promoted. At the same time, we must also have such mental preparation, that is, these machines are not perfect, and the broad masses of farmers are not familiar with them yet, and there will be such and such shortcomings in the working process. Therefore, the leadership should adopt an attitude of enthusiastic support and specific analysis so that in the future when encountering various different opinions, they can be treated differently and make correct decisions.

The existing transplanters, in terms of the quality of transplanting, although there has been a significant improvement, and machine-transplanted rice has generally achieved the effect of increasing production, there are still cases of missed transplanting, snagging, and seedling damage. How to create transplanters that eliminate missed transplanting, snagging, and seedling damage as soon as possible, actively improve the quality of transplanting, and improve the uniformity and effective qualification rate is the first task that urgently needs to be solved in the experimental research work of transplanters.

The existing transplanters, in terms of the operation items completed, only solve the problem of transplanting in one process. In the processes of seedling raising, seedling pulling, seedling washing, seedling arranging, seedling transporting, and seedling loading, there are generally no corresponding tools, and manual operation has not been eliminated. Moreover, after the mechanization of transplanting in one process, other processes will take up a lot of auxiliary working hours in comparison, so it cannot maximize the overall improvement of transplanting work efficiency. Like using a Nan 105B transplanter for transplanting, it requires 20 people to pull seedlings and 3 people to arrange seedlings. This situation must be changed as soon as possible. Therefore, to solve the problem of the serialization of tools in the entire transplanting process, it is also necessary to create a complete set of semi-mechanized and mechanized seedling raising, seedling pulling, seedling washing, seedling arranging, seedling transporting, and seedling loading tools with high work efficiency and in line with agronomic requirements. This is the second task that urgently needs to be solved in the current experimental research work of transplanters.

The existing transplanters, in terms of their structural performance, are mostly relatively simple, suitable for the current large-scale promotion. In the future, it is also necessary to improve the existing transplanters, most of which still use human power or animal power, as soon as possible, to achieve the use of electromechanical power traction and achieve the level of mechanized automation. Therefore, widely carrying out experimental research on power transplanters, such as power self-propelled, tractor-traction, suspended, rope-traction, and remote control, is the third task that urgently needs to be solved in the experimental research work of transplanters.

In order to complete the research on the serialization of paddy field operation machinery, we also need a complete set of agricultural machinery suitable for implementing the "Eight-Character Charter for Agriculture" in paddy fields and suitable for garden field operations. For example, paddy field deep plows, harrows, binders, rollers, middle tillers suitable for dense planting requirements, pesticide machinery for preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, and high-efficiency manual, animal-powered, and machine-drawn harvesters, threshers, and dryers.

All of these are the important tasks of actively realizing semi-mechanization, mechanization, semi-automation, and automation of paddy field farming. Of course, completing these tasks is very arduous, but it is also entirely possible. First of all, now we not only have various finalized manual and animal-powered transplanters, some of which (such as Nan 105B) can also be tractioned by electromechanical power rope traction machines or tractor traction, and Guangxi has also created machine-powered self-propelled transplanters. Zhejiang's Zhejiang Nong 4, Jiangxi's 60-1 and 60-2, and Hunan Leiyang 6016, etc., seem to be improved, and they can all meet the requirements of mechanization and automation. Some areas have made models for seedling pulling tools, and some have proposed design plans. In addition, various places have made many achievements in reforming agricultural implements such as paddy field deep plows and harrows. Some areas have successfully modified tractors to go down to paddy fields and have achieved preliminary success. In particular, various places are conducting large-scale production experiments on electromechanical rope traction machines, and so on. These are all extremely important material and technical foundations. Secondly, through the mass movement of vigorously carrying out tool reform for more than two years, not only has a lot of experience been accumulated, but also a scientific and technical team including "local experts" has been cultivated and trained, which is becoming increasingly stronger. At present, this mass technological innovation and technological revolution movement is also developing more and more deeply and extensively. Third, the most fundamental guarantee is that we have the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao and the incomparably superior socialist system. Therefore, we firmly believe that under the leadership of the Party, giving full play to the wisdom of the masses, the serialization of transplanting tools, and then gradually realizing the glorious task of semi-mechanization, mechanization, semi-automation, and automation of paddy field farming, will surely be successfully completed.

    水稻插秧机的诞生是水田作业的革命
    李菁玉
    目前，全国种植水稻地区都在大量推广水稻插秧机。定型推广的有湖南醴陵二号、江西59型、广西59—3型、上海南汇一号、湖北汉川59型、浙农四号、南105—B型等七种；向全国推荐试用的有十四种。广大农民热爱插秧机，竞相使用。这是水田作业的大革命，是一件十分令人鼓舞的事情。
    机插水稻不但提高工效而且比手插增产
    用水稻插秧机插秧，不但质量符合农业技术要求，比手插提高工效几倍、十几倍到几十倍，而且普遍获得了增产的良好效果。据贵州省和广西僮族自治区柳州、南宁等地的调查，去年机插稻田比手插稻田一般增产5％——20％。又据贵州、湖南、四川、安徽、湖北、江西、河北等十四个点对比试验的统计，机插比手插增产2％—10％的有六个点，增产11％—20％的有四个点，增产21％—35％的有四个点。
    机插水稻为什么能够增产呢？根据各地的试验对比材料来看，大致有以下几个因素：
    一、穴距均匀一致，可以保证合理密植。这是机插比手插增产最重要的一个因素。机插每亩穴数、株数都能得到最大限度的保证，而且分布均匀。这样就既可以增加每亩的基本苗数，又能使每穴和每株秧苗都得到一定吸收营养的范围，上部通风透光也比较好，从而能够保证全部秧苗的正常生长发育。这是手插办不到的。水稻是自花授粉植物，机插秧苗生长整齐，扬花期一致，可以提高受精率和延长灌浆期，增加有效子粒，并使子粒饱满，减少空壳瘪粒。贵州省铜仁县江口公社青年万能农场的调查证明，去年机插水稻每亩有三万三千穴，而手插的只有两万一千多穴。机插比手插的穴数多三分之一以上。又据中共铜仁县委工作组具体调查的几丘田，1958年用手插，1959年用机插，结果是：机插比手插穴数多17．8％，基本苗多18％，1959年比1958年增产38％—42％。当然，增产不能只是机插一个因素，而是综合了各方面因素的结果。但是，不论肥田、瘦田、一般田，机插都比手插的增产，这一事实充分证明了机插的优越性。
    从机插秧苗与手插秧苗生长发育情况的比较来看，机插秧苗返青快，生长好，成熟早。贵州铜仁县江口公社青年农场观察证明，机插秧苗四五天就可返青，比手插秧苗要快三、四天。有效分蘖、植株高度、穗长、每穗粒数，都高于手插的。
    二、机插秧苗有“松、浅、匀、密”四个特点。松：插秧机利用秧爪分秧，秧苗一株株松散地插入田中，呈“扇子形”，没有包心秧，秧根舒展，利于秧苗发育均衡。手插秧苗多为“一株香”，外部秧苗发育好，分蘖早，中间的包心秧，因得不到足够的阳光，分蘖少，而且逐渐衰退。机插秧苗不致发生互相拥挤、互相排斥的苗欺苗的现象。浅，就是秧苗的入泥深度浅。根据各地调查，机插秧苗入泥深度都在四厘米左右，最深不超过五厘米。这样能使秧苗发育一致。由于表层泥土松软，温度较高，所以能促进秧苗早返青，早分蘖。匀：机插秧苗不仅是株距匀，深浅也匀。这就不至于穴与穴、株与株之间由于生长发育的不一致产生发育快的分蘖早，发育慢的不易早期分蘖，因而影响产量。江口公社青年农场的观察，手插稻田一般是三类苗占5％—20％，机插稻田三类苗最多不到5％。密：机插苗密而匀，加上分蘖快，就能够抑制后期的无效分蘖。手插秧苗则稀密不匀，早期有效分蘖也不匀，无法抑制后期分蘖，因而产量减低。江口公社青年农场观察，机插秧苗无效分蘖一般在5％左右，而手插多在10％以上。
    三、机插工效高，能抢住季节。水稻插秧对农时要求很严格，一般要求在十天以内插完。拖延时间，就要减产。同时，插秧劳动强度大，费工多。农业大跃进以来，插秧密度加大，用工量也加大，因此抢住插秧季节更加重要。如广西苍梧县东安公社去年和今年都是种植六万多亩早稻，去年全靠手插，插了半个多月，今年使用了三百七十六架插秧机，有二十四个生产队六天就插完了，全公社也只要十天就可完成早稻插秧任务。机插秧苗既抢住了季节，又返青快，生长好，成熟早，也就相应地减轻了自然灾害的危害程度。
    根据以上许多事实分析，可以肯定，机插是水稻增产的一项重要因素。
    机插水稻增产的原因是多方面的。尽管有的还有待于进一步地观测和分析，才能作出更全面更科学的结论，但是，机插水稻普遍增产是铁的事实。它说明了插秧机的创造和推广有着十分重大的意义。
    水稻插秧机的创造过程是两条路线的斗争过程
    水稻插秧，是我国农业精耕细作传统中一项优良的栽培技术。插秧技术要求高，劳动强度大。水田地区的农民，千百年来一直感到插秧是一项极艰苦的作业。湖南有一首民歌，深刻地描绘了手插秧的苦状，说：“用手插秧苦难言，脸朝泥巴背朝天，腰酸背痛手插破，一天难插三分田。”据历史记载，宋朝时候湖北武昌曾有过一种“秧马”，是插秧时的辅助工具，人可以坐在上面插秧，减轻一些弯腰曲背的痛苦。但是，在当时封建统治之下，只能是昙花一现，并无留传。全国解放后，广大劳动人民生产积极性空前高涨，他们为了迅速提高生产，和减轻插秧的体力劳动强度，提出了创造插秧机的要求，在不少地区还进行了创造插秧机的尝试。农民群众的这种要求和尝试，在党的重视和积极领导下，迅速地形成创造插秧机的技术革命运动。水稻插秧机的试验研究，就开始从无到有、由低级到高级逐步地发展起来。
    1955年秋，华中农业科学研究所匡梁（转业军人），在党的大力支持下，着手插秧机分秧机构的研究，先后设计试制了十几种分秧机构，进行数百次的试验，初步找出了合理的分秧办法。与此同时，又有农民出身的科学工作者林体强同志，在党的领导和支持下，经过分析研究秧苗的特性，进行了插秧机的设计和试验。仅仅几个月时间，就解决了分秧、插秧等关键问题。1956年2月，我国第一台水稻插秧机的雏形——梳爪纵拉分秧压力送秧单行滚插式插秧机，在浙江杭州召开的全国水田农具座谈会上出现，并且作了实际表演，证明可以将秧苗插入田中。这是一个可贵的尝试。从此，这个新生的幼芽，在党的培育抚养之下，便以旺盛的生命力，不断发展，迅速成长。到今年2月止的四年中，先后召开了七次全国性的专业会议。各地也为此开了更多的专业会议。在插秧机的改进提高上，一次会议比一次会议取得了显著的成就，而且形式多种多样，型号和材料因地制宜，真是百花齐放、万紫千红。在1957年第四次会议时，参加会议的机子就有南102、南103、华中直插式、延边夹插式、南农圆盘式、南工铲式、工农牌直插式、湖南农机厂滚插式和天津杨柳青铁工厂滚插式等九种，型号比第一、二、三次会议时大大增加。到1958年9月第五次会议时，参加的机子达到了四十一台；1959年6月第六次会议到会机子为六十三台；今年2月第七次会议又达到八十四台。这一事实说明，插秧机的创造由于很快形成了群众运动，所以能够在较短期间取得显著成效。
    但是，插秧机创造过程并不是一帆风顺的。它经历了与保守主义者的种种斗争。在插秧机初创的时候，有些人就认定机器插秧是不可能的，散布“插秧不能机械化”的论调，向这个新生事物泼冷水。如1957年4月第三次插秧机现场会议时，插秧机虽已较1956年试制的第一台模型有了很大改进，但是由于当时漏秧、勾秧、伤秧等还相当严重，而且机身还较笨重，操作不很方便，保守主义者就抓住这个新事物刚萌芽时不可避免的缺点，横加指责和攻击。林体强同志创造性的研究活动，遭到了一些资产阶级知识分子的百般刁难。当时华东农业科学研究所农具系的一个右派分子还企图扼杀这一新生事物，要取消插秧机的研究课题。但是，党对所有的插秧机创造者都给予了极大的鼓励和支持，并对资产阶级思想观点展开了严肃的批判。因而插秧机的研究工作才没有受到阻挠，反而从斗争中得到愈来愈深入的开展。由林体强等同志首创的插秧机，很快从“南101”不断改进成为现在的“南105B型”，达到了定型的标准。
    在插秧机的创造过程中，还有人认为插秧机在某些农业机械化工作比我国开始得早得多的资本主义国家，如意大利、日本研究了几十年，尚且没有成功，我国技术落后，更不可能成功。党也及时地向这种洋奴思想开展了坚决的斗争，并且彻底批判了少数资产阶级技术人员完全抄袭书本、脱离生产脱离实际的“闭门造车”的研究方法。同时，党发动广大工农群众，从生产实践中大胆创造，掀起了一个大创插秧机的群众运动。由于我们有共产党的领导，有无比优越的社会主义制度，资本主义国家不能很快解决的问题，我们社会主义国家却可以很快得到解决。
    持有资产阶级观点的人的错误之一，是不相信群众。有的人曾认为插秧机是项尖端技术，工农群众不可能攀登这一科学高峰。实际上，现在插秧机的创造者多数是工农群众，而且恰恰是他们首先解决了分秧、插秧等技术难关。如林体强同志从打字机等距移动原理，找到了利用秧箱移动的分秧办法。贺继生同志从梳头的梳子的启发，设计出钳夹式的分秧机构，创造成功醴陵简易式插秧机。大量事实证明，工农群众有着无穷的创造才能。正是因为广大工农群众的大胆创造，所以我们的插秧机型号多种多样，有土的洋的和半土半洋的，各省有各省的，可以供各个地区根据不同的条件和需要加以选择推广。工人农民所以具有无穷的创造才能，就在于他们是生产的实践者，有着最深刻最丰富的实际生产知识；在于他们在党的领导下，走上了自己解放自己的道路，而有着高度的社会主义和共产主义的觉悟。同时，他们有百折不回的毅力，能够虚心学习，也不怕失败和丢面子，再接再厉，坚持到底。
    我国插秧机的创造过程，是两条路线剧烈斗争的过程。我国插秧机的创造成功，是党的总路线的胜利，是毛泽东思想指导下的群众技术革新和技术革命运动的胜利，是大跃进、人民公社的巨大威力的胜利。
    水稻插秧机对加速我国农业机械化的意义
    水稻插秧机的研究成功和推广普及，不仅对当前工农业生产大跃进起着十分巨大的作用，而且对于加速实现我国农业机械化有着十分深远的意义。
    今年全国共计划推广插秧机约四百五十万部，这是一个令人鼓舞的计划。根据这个计划，我们可以算几笔账：第一，约有70％左右的水稻田（约三亿五千万亩）实现机插；第二，若按每亩省工两个计算，全国仅机插水稻一项，就可节约劳动日七亿个左右，这不仅大大缓和广大水田地区“双抢”季节劳力不足的矛盾，而且可以把节约下来的大量劳动力用在其他生产方面，促进工农业生产的全面发展；第三，机插保证质量，可以增产，若按每亩增产稻谷十斤计算，就是一笔很大的数目。
    大规模推广插秧机，还意味着我国水稻插秧这一作业，开始由手工操作跃进到半机械化和机械化、自动化的崭新阶段。可以说，它是我国水田农具的大革命，是我国水田机械化的起点。
    实现农业机械化，在世界上许多国家说来，主要目的是在于解决劳动力不足的问题。而在我国却具有两重重要的意义。它不仅可以解决劳动力的问题，而且可以更好地贯彻农业“八字宪法”，为解决园田化的机械化问题打下基础；这对发扬我国农民精耕细作的优良传统，不断地提高单位面积产量，有着十分重大的意义。
    我国水稻种植面积约占全国耕地的四分之一，其中只有很少部分是直播的，绝大部分地区采取插秧的办法。因为插秧能够在一年之内种两季、三季作物，经济地利用土地，提高复种指数，而且插秧还可达到合理密植和减少田间的杂草。因此，水稻插秧机的创造成功，还不同于一般的工具改革，它为我国精耕细作的农业机械化树立了一个良好典范。插秧机的不断改进和提高，必将加速水田耕作机械化的实现。
    在双季连作稻地区，保证水稻收成的一条重要经验是：“早黄晚青”。这四个字充分说明，水稻要达到精耕细作的要求，抢收抢插是个极为重要的环节。一般晚稻成熟收割的时间不宜超过霜降以后，由于植株生长期的需要，就要求在立秋节前插完晚稻秧。1956年浙江嘉兴专区农业局的试验证明：晚稻插秧愈早，收成愈好。一般立秋前十八天插的，每亩产量为五百斤左右，较立秋后两天插的，亩产量高一倍左右。
    同年安徽全省的调查，有一部分连作晚稻由于在处暑后甚至白露才插秧，因为生长期不够，以致歉收。这些事例说明，水田耕作机械化，特别是水稻插秧和水稻收割的机械化，在促进水田地区生产的持续跃进上，有着特殊重要的作用。
    在实现我国农业机械化中，水田和山地的机械化是比较复杂和艰巨的任务，而插秧又是水田机械化中技术要求高、比较难解决的一道环节。因此插秧机的推广，不但给水田机械化开辟了顺畅的道路，还将鼓舞广大群众积极进行平原、丘陵和山地的机械化，从而全面加速我国农业机械化的实现。
      为不断提高插秧机水平和革新水田作业机具而斗争
    当前我国的水稻插秧机已经进入定型推广的新阶段。但是，离开全面地实现水田机械化还有一个相当艰巨的过程。即使在水稻插秧这项作业上，也还只是开始进入到半机械化的阶段，还有许多工作必须及时地进一步去完成。因此，对正在大量推广的插秧机，必须认真做好一系列的思想组织工作。同时也必须有这样的精神准备，即这些机子并不是每一件都完美无缺的，广大的农民群众暂时还不熟悉它，而且在工作过程中还会产生这样和那样的缺点。所以在领导上要采取热情支持和具体分析的态度，以备在今后遇到各种不同的意见时，能够有区别地对待并作出正确的处理。
    现有的插秧机，就其插秧的质量来说，虽然有了显著提高，而且机插水稻普遍获得了增产的效果，但是还有漏插、勾秧、伤秧等情况。如何尽快地创造出漏插、勾秧、伤秧三消灭的插秧机，积极提高插秧质量，提高均匀度和有效合格率，这是插秧机试验研究工作上第一个迫切需要解决的任务。
    现有的插秧机，就其完成的作业项目看来，都还仅仅是解决了插秧一道工序上的问题，在育秧、拔秧、洗秧、整秧、运秧、装秧等工序上，一般还没有相应的工具，还没有摆脱手工操作。而且在插秧一道工序上实现了机插化之后，其他工序相形之下要占用很多辅助工时，因而还不能最大限度地全面提高插秧工效。像使用一台南105B型机子插秧，需要二十个人拔秧，三个人整秧。这种情况必须尽快地改变。因此，解决整个插秧过程工具系列化的问题，还需要创造出一整套工效高并合乎农艺要求的半机械化和机械化的育秧、拔秧、洗秧、整秧、运秧、装秧工具。这是当前插秧机试验研究工作上第二个迫切需要解决的任务。
    现有的插秧机，就其结构性能说来，多数是比较简易，适合当前大量推广的。今后还必须尽快地把现有的多数还是利用人力或使用畜力的插秧机，进一步改进，达到利用机电动力牵引，达到机械化自动化的水平。因此，广泛开展对动力插秧机的试验研究，如动力自走式、拖拉机牵引式、悬挂式、绳索牵引式以及遥远控制式等，是插秧机试验研究工作上第三个迫切需要解决的任务。
    为完成水田作业机械系列化的研究，我们还需要有一整套的适合水田贯彻“农业八字宪法”、适合园田化作业的农业机械。例如水田深耕犁、耙、扎、滚，适合密植要求的中耕器，防治病虫的药械，高效率人力、畜力和机引的收获机、脱谷机、干燥机等。
    所有这些，就是当前积极地实现水田耕作半机械化、机械化、半自动化、自动化的重要任务。当然，完成这些任务是十分艰巨的，但也是完全可能的。首先，现在我们不仅已经有了各种定型的人力和畜力的插秧机，其中有的（如南105B）也可以用机电动力绳索牵引机或拖拉机牵引，广西还创造了机力自走式插秧机，浙江的浙农4号、江西的60—1号和60—2号，湖南耒阳6016型等，看来加以提高，都可以适合机械化自动化的要求。拔秧工具有的地区已经作出了模型，有的提出了设计方案。此外，各地在改革水田深耕犁、耙等农具上都作出了不少成绩，有些地区改装拖拉机下水田获得了初步成功，特别是各地正在进行着机电绳索牵引机的大面积生产实验，等等。这些都是极为重要的物质技术基础。其次，经过两年多来大搞工具改革的群众运动，不仅积累了许多经验，而且培养锻炼出了一支日益强大的包括“土专家”的科学技术队伍。目前，这个群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动也正在日益深入广泛地开展。第三，最根本的保证是我们有党和毛主席的英明领导，有无比优越的社会主义制度。因此，我们坚信，在党的领导下，充分发挥群众的智慧，插秧工具系列化，进而逐步地实现水田耕作半机械化、机械化、半自动化、自动化这一光荣的任务，是一定能够胜利完成的。
