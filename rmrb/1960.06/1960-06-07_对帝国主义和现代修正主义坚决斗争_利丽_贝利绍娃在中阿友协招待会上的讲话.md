Xinhua News Agency, June 6th – Lili Bellishova, Member of the Presidium of the Albanian People's Assembly, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, and Secretary of the Secretariat, delivered a speech at the reception held by the Sino-Albanian Friendship Association on the 5th to welcome distinguished Albanian guests. The full text is as follows:

Dear friends,

First of all, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to the leaders of the Party and the government, to all the friends who are attending this banquet tonight, and to the Sino-Albanian Friendship Association.

During these days that we have been with our Chinese brothers, we have received a very warm and grand reception, whether from the senior leaders of the Party and the state or from the working masses. We know that the Chinese people are our dear brothers, but we must admit that we did not expect such a reception. I would like to emphasize that when we came to your country, we passed through the Soviet Union, where our respected Comrade Brezhnev, Comrade Furtseva, and other Soviet comrades received us very warmly. The hospitality that our delegation received in Moscow and Beijing is by no means accidental; it is a manifestation of the deep affection and unbreakable friendship that connects our peoples.

This is a manifestation of a new type of socialist relationship between our countries. It is unprecedented in history that such great peoples as the Soviet and Chinese peoples should show such respect and love for a small nation like ours. Only socialist countries can pursue such a correct policy towards all nations, large and small. Bourgeois journalists will now wonder: why such a reception for the Albanians? Last year, when Comrade Khrushchev was in Albania, bourgeois journalists also clamored incessantly about the reasons for his visit to Albania, but Comrade Khrushchev answered them very clearly: "The whole secret here lies in the deep love and friendship that the Soviet people and the Soviet government have for the Albanian people." This unbreakable friendship linking our peoples, and the correct relations between our countries, based on respect for sovereign equality, selfless assistance, and fraternal close cooperation, have great international significance, especially for colonial and semi-colonial countries, because they show these countries who are the true friends of the people and what is the path to achieving genuine freedom and independence.

Comrades, everyone here has said many complimentary things about our people. Indeed, our people, under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha, have achieved the greatest victories in their history. They have won independence, taken a firm stand against all the evil activities of imperialism and Yugoslav revisionists, Albania's industrial production has increased twenty-one and a half times compared to pre-war levels, agricultural collectivization is almost completed, and the cultural revolution is developing victoriously.

Why can such a small and backward country achieve such achievements? This is because the Albanian people are led by the Labor Party, which has always been loyal to Marxism-Leninism, has waged a resolute struggle against various tendencies, and has consolidated its unity. This is because our people have the continuous assistance and support of the great Soviet Union. Without the Soviet Union, we would not have been able to achieve such achievements under any circumstances. Therefore, from the day it was born, our Party has educated the Albanian people to strive to consolidate the vital friendship with the Soviet Union and to protect it as they would protect the apple of their eye. Other socialist countries and China have helped us in the past and are helping us now. I would like to take this opportunity to express our heartfelt thanks to the representatives of the fraternal Chinese people for the fraternal assistance they have given us.

The Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, have achieved great historical victories. As everyone knows, the victory of the people's revolution in China is the greatest victory for mankind after the October Revolution and the defeat of the fascist bandits. The Chinese people have achieved tremendous victories in socialist construction through heroic and selfless labor. These victories are a great contribution to strengthening our entire socialist camp. Just think what it means that a country with a population of 650 million, which was once oppressed, backward, and poor, has stood up and is organized on the glorious socialist road? This is a great historical achievement of the Chinese Communist Party. Comrades, we are proud of the great victories of the Chinese people.

Dear Comrades,

We live in a wonderful era when all roads lead to communism. The main force of the social movement today is the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. It is the fundamental factor in defending peace, the main pillar of the people fighting for freedom and rights, and the indestructible fortress of communism. Therefore, the victories achieved by socialist countries in the struggle to develop their economies, especially the brilliant victories achieved by the Soviet Union in the fields of economy, science, and technology, are of very great historical significance. The strength of our camp, first of all, the strength of the Soviet Union in political, economic, and military science, is the force that prevents imperialism from realizing its aggressive plans. The countries of the socialist camp play a great role in developing the revolutionary movement because it shows the workers of the world the superiority of the socialist system.

The Soviet Union and all socialist countries resolutely pursue a correct policy of defending peace. This makes the broad strata of the people of all countries in the world more united around us. Yesterday, Comrade Khrushchev, on behalf of the Soviet government, put forward new proposals for complete and thorough disarmament, which will be supported by all peace-loving countries. What else can the leaders of Western countries say now? One thing is very clear: imperialism has repeatedly rejected the proposals of the Soviet Union, thereby exposing themselves to the people of all countries as enemies of peace and criminals preparing for a new world war. Our camp pursues such a policy not because of weakness, but because it is in the vital interests of all mankind.

Let those who do not want to understand this truth try it, and they will surely suffer the same fate as the U-2 American spy plane. Our country and all peace-loving people in the world angrily condemn the American imperialists and firmly support Comrade Khrushchev's statement. Our country, like all other socialist countries, has been and will continue to support the Soviet Union's correct policy of peace, expose the aggressive policies of imperialism, and constantly maintain vigilance. Our parties, headed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, will continue to wage a resolute struggle against bourgeois ideology and modern revisionism. At the recent Congress of the Socialist Alliance of Yugoslavia, the Titoites once again exposed their true colors, exposing themselves as the most aggressive detachment of revisionism and the faithful lackeys of imperialism. They are opportunistic, using the words "Marxism" and "Socialism" to cover themselves as needed, but their essence will not change. They are incorrigible anti-Marxists and anti-socialists. As the saying goes, a hunchback can only be straightened in the grave. When the United States committed aggression against the Soviet Union, the Yugoslav revisionists openly sided with American imperialism, just like a servant serving his master. We in Albania know the Yugoslav revisionists very well. They have used all means to oppose our Party, state, and people for seventeen years, but they have failed and will continue to fail. Imperialists vainly attempt to split the socialist camp and the internationalist movement. They are gathering up Yugoslav revisionists, who, like termites gnawing at wood and bacteria harming the body, vainly attempt to corrode us from within, to serve this purpose, but the unity of the socialist camp is unbreakable because it is not a "grouping of politicians" but an inevitability of objective history. The unity and friendship of socialist countries are built on an unshakable foundation, on the immortal and invincible ideas of Marxism-Leninism, on the vital interests of our people, and on the common path for socialist and communist construction.

Comrades, the international prestige of the People's China is increasing day by day. Without the active participation of China, no important international issue can be resolved. Our country, like all other socialist countries, has supported in the past and will always support the restoration of the legitimate seat of fraternal China in the United Nations, and has condemned in the past and now condemns the American policy of aggression against Taiwan, which is the sacred territory of China. It is indeed incomprehensible and absurd that the representatives of such a great people do not participate in the United Nations, but regardless of whether the American imperialists recognize the only legitimate government of China, the Chinese people are still marching forward by leaps and bounds.

Comrades, our friendship is developing day by day, our economic and cultural exchanges are increasing, and various delegations from our two countries have visited China and Albania. These exchanges will also develop and be consolidated in the future. I would like to once again thank the leaders of the Sino-Albanian Friendship Association, which fulfills the noble mission of helping to strengthen the friendship between our two peoples.

I would like to end my speech with a few lines from our famous poet Chachi:

My motherland,
How many friends you have!
You hear,
A word from the depths of the heart,
It resounds in every part of China:
"China and Albania
Are like one person,
We have a common path
And common ideals."

Who has bound us
So closely together on this path?
The Soviet Union,
This name,
Like a guiding light in the darkness,
Shines in the world!
For all those who aspire to a happy life,
The Soviet Union is
Their first friend.

Let us raise our glasses,
To Comrade Mao Zedong and the other leaders of the Chinese people,
To the Communist Party of China and the People's Republic of China,
To the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union,
To the further consolidation of the friendship between the Chinese and Albanian peoples,
To the chairman of the Sino-Albanian Friendship Association and other leading comrades,
To world peace,
Cheers!

    对帝国主义和现代修正主义坚决斗争
    利丽·贝利绍娃在中阿友协招待会上的讲话
    新华社6日讯　阿尔巴尼亚人民议会主席团委员、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、书记处书记利丽·贝利绍娃，5日在中阿友协为欢迎阿尔巴尼亚贵宾所举行的招待会上的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的朋友们：
    首先我要衷心地向党和政府的领导人，向所有今天晚上参加这一宴会的朋友们和中阿友好协会致以衷心的谢意。
    在我们同中国兄弟们相处的这几天中，不论是党和国家的高级领导人，或是劳动群众都给了我们非常热情的和盛大的接待。我们知道，中国人民是我们的亲爱的弟兄，可是我们应该承认，这样的接待是我们所没有想到的。我想强调指出：在来你们国家的时候，我们路过了苏联，在那里我们的尊敬的勃列日涅夫同志，福尔采娃同志和其他苏联同志非常热情地接待了我们。我们代表团在莫斯科和北京所受到的招待，绝不是偶然的，它是连结我们人民的深情厚意和牢不可破的友谊的表现。
    这是我们国家之间的新型的社会主义关系的表现。像苏联人民和中国人民这样伟大的人民对一个像我们这样小的民族如此敬重和热爱，在历史上是没有先例的。只有社会主义国家才能对所有大小民族奉行这样的正确的政策。资产阶级记者们现在会想：为什么这样接待阿尔巴尼亚人？去年当赫鲁晓夫同志在阿尔巴尼亚的时候，资产阶级记者也对他访阿的原因叫嚷不休，可是赫鲁晓夫同志非常清楚地回答了他们：“这里全部秘密就在于苏联人民和苏联政府对阿尔巴尼亚人民怀着深切的爱戴和友情。”这种联结我们人民的牢不可破的友谊，以及我们这些国家之间的建立在尊重主权平等、无私援助和兄弟的亲密合作基础上的正确关系具有重大的国际意义，特别是对殖民地和半殖民地国家来说，这种关系是一个光辉的范例，因为它向这些国家指明谁是人民的真正朋友，什么是取得真正的自由和独立的道路。
    同志们，大家在这里讲了很多称颂我国人民的话，的确，我国人民在以恩·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下取得了他们历史上最大的胜利。他们赢得了独立，对帝国主义和南斯拉夫修正主义者的全部罪恶活动采取了针锋相对的立场，阿尔巴尼亚的工业生产与战前比较增加二十一点五倍，农业集体化也差不多完成了，文化革命正在胜利地开展。
    为什么一个这样小的落后的国家能取得这样的成就呢？这是因为领导阿尔巴尼亚人民的是劳动党，它一向忠实于马克思列宁主义，对各种倾向进行了坚决的斗争，并且巩固了自己的团结。这是因为我国人民有伟大的苏联的继续不断的援助和支持。没有苏联，我们是无论如何不能取得这样的成就的。因此我们党从它诞生之日起就教育阿尔巴尼亚人民竭力巩固同苏联的富有生命力的友谊，并且像保护眼珠一样保护它。其他社会主义国家和中国过去和现在都对我们进行了帮助。我愿利用这个机会向兄弟的中国人民的代表表示衷心感谢，感谢他们所给予我们的兄弟般的援助。
    以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党领导下的中国人民取得了伟大的历史性的胜利。众所周知，人民革命在中国的胜利是十月革命和战胜法西斯匪帮后人类最伟大的胜利。中国人民用英勇的忘我的劳动在社会主义建设中取得了巨大的胜利，这些胜利是对加强我们整个社会主义阵营的一个巨大贡献。只要你想一想‘一个曾经是被压迫的、落后的和贫困的，拥有六亿五千万人口的国家站立起来，并在光荣的社会主义道路上组织起来了，意味着什么呢？这是中国共产党的伟大的历史性的功绩。同志们，我们为中国人民的伟大的胜利感到骄傲。
    亲爱的同志们，
    我们生活在一个美好的条条道路通向共产主义的时代。当今社会运动的主要力量是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营。它是保卫和平的根本因素，是为自由和权利而斗争的人民的主要支柱，是共产主义的不可摧毁的堡垒。因此，社会主义各国在发展经济的斗争中所取得的胜利，特别是苏联在经济、科学和技术方面所取得的辉煌胜利有着非常伟大的历史意义。我们阵营的强大力量，首先是苏联在政治、经济和军事科学方面的强大力量，是制止帝国主义，使他们不能实现其侵略计划的力量。社会主义阵营各国在发展革命运动方面起着很大的作用，因为它向全世界劳动者表现了社会主义制度的优越性。
    苏联和所有社会主义国家坚决奉行保卫和平的正确政策。这就使世界各国人民的广大阶层更加团结到我们的周围来。昨天赫鲁晓夫同志代表苏联政府提出了新的彻底全面裁减军备的新建议，这些新建议将得到一切爱好和平的国家的支持。现在西方国家的领导人还能说些什么呢？一点是很清楚的：帝国主义一次又一次地拒绝苏联的建议，从而在世界各国人民面前暴露出他们是和平的敌人，是准备新的世界大战的罪人。我们阵营奉行这样的政策不是因为软弱，而是因为它符合全人类的切身利益。
    让那些不愿了解这一真理的人尝试一下吧，他们一定会遭到像U—2型美国特务飞机一样的下场。我们的国家和世界上一切爱好和平的人民都愤怒地谴责美帝国主义者，并坚决拥护赫鲁晓夫同志的声明。我国同其他一切社会主义国家一样，过去曾经是，今后仍将继续支持苏联的正确的和平政策，揭发帝国主义的侵略政策，经常保持着警惕性。以苏联共产党为首的我们这些党将继续坚决进行反对资产阶级思想和现代修正主义。在最近的南斯拉夫社会主义联盟代表大会上，铁托分子再一次暴露了他们的真正面目，暴露了他们是修正主义的最富有侵略性的别动队和帝国主义的忠实走狗，他们随机应变，根据需要利用“马克思主义”和“社会主义”的词句来掩盖自己，可是他们的本质是不会改变的。他们是不可救药的反马克思主义者和反社会主义者。俗话说：驮背只有进坟墓才能直过来。当美国对苏联进行侵略的时候，南斯拉夫修正主义者公开袒护美帝国主义，就像仆从为其主子效劳一样，我们阿尔巴尼亚对南斯拉夫修正主义者很了解，他们用一切手段反对我们党、国家和人民达十七年之久，可是他们失败了，今后还要失败。帝国主义者妄图分裂社会主义阵营和国际主义运动。他们把像虫蛀木头细菌为害机体一样妄图从内部腐蚀我们的南斯拉夫修正主义者收拢起来为此目的服务，但是社会主义阵营的团结是牢不可破的，因为它不是“政客的组合”，而是客观历史的必然性。社会主义国家的团结和友谊是建立在不可动摇的基础之上，是建立在不朽的战无不胜的马克思列宁主义思想的基础之上，是建立在我们人民的切身利益的基础之上，是建立在为社会主义、共产主义建设的共同道路的基础之上的。
    同志们，人民中国的国际威望一天天地提高。没有中国的积极参加，任何重要的国际问题都不能得到解决。我国同其他一切社会主义国家一样曾经过去支持了、今后也仍将永远支持兄弟的中国恢复它在联合国中的合法席位，过去和现在都谴责美国对台湾的侵略政策，台湾是中国的神圣领土。一个如此伟大的人民的代表没有参加联合国，的确是难以理解和荒谬的，但是，不管美帝国主义者是否承认中国唯一的合法政府，中国人民照样大踏步地在向前迈进。
    同志们，我们的友谊正在日益发展，我们的经济和文化来往正在增加，我们两国的各种代表团访问了中国和阿尔巴尼亚，这些来往在将来也将发展和巩固。我想再一次感谢中阿友好协会的领导，它完成着崇高的使命，帮助加强我们两国人民的友谊。
    我想用我们著名的诗人恰奇的几句诗来结束我的讲话：
    我的祖国
    你有多少朋友！
    你听到，
    从心的深处发出的一句话，
    它响在中国的每一处地方：
    “中国和阿尔巴尼亚
    像一个人一样，
    我们有着共同的道路
    和共同的理想。”
    是谁把我们
    紧紧地团结在这条道路上？
    苏维埃联盟
    这个名字
    像黑暗中的指路明灯一样，
    在世界上闪耀着光芒！
    对一切向往幸福生活的人，
    苏联是
    他们的第一个朋友。
    让我们举杯，
    为毛泽东同志和中国人民的其他领袖，
    为中国共产党和中华人民共和国，
    为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，
    为中阿人民友谊的进一步巩固，
    为中阿友好协会主席和其他领导同志，
    为世界和平，
    干杯！
