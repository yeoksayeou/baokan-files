Xinhua News Agency, June 19th: This reporter reports: The Japanese people's eighteenth national unified action, which has achieved great success in the anti-American and anti-Kishi struggle, ended victoriously today according to the original plan.

From the 11th to the 19th, more than 13 million people from all walks of life in Japan participated in general strikes, protest rallies, and demonstrations. The number of people mobilized and the wide participation of various strata exceeded the previous seventeen unified actions. One of the achievements of this unified action is that the earth-shattering anti-American wave finally forced Eisenhower to stop his visit to Japan. This is a preliminary brilliant victory for the Japanese people in the struggle against the "Security Treaty" for more than a year. This victory makes the Japanese people more aware of the truth that American imperialism is a paper tiger, thereby further strengthening their confidence, raising their awareness, and encouraging them to advance victoriously and continue the struggle.

The June 15th general strike in the eighteenth unified action was actually a contest between the democratic forces of Japan and the Japanese reactionaries. On the 15th, when 5.8 million workers held strikes across the country, and Tokyo workers and students protested to the Diet, the Kishi Nobusuke government instigated police and fascist bandits to attack demonstrators, causing bloodshed and killing a female student. Kishi Nobusuke was confident that this attack would frighten the Japanese people, so he could welcome his master Eisenhower in a "calm" situation. However, things developed in the opposite direction to what Kishi Nobusuke had hoped. This bloody tragedy aroused the anger of people across the country. After receiving negative education, the Japanese people became more aware of Kishi Nobusuke's brutal face, further acted, and gave the Japanese reactionaries a powerful counterattack, resulting in Kishi Nobusuke temporarily restraining himself.

Another achievement of this unified action was a public trial of the Kishi Nobusuke group's crime of forcing the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" to "naturally take effect." The people used action to declare that this "natural establishment" was invalid. On the 18th, when the Kishi Nobusuke group's conspiracy to force the new "Security Treaty" to "naturally take effect" was revealed, 400,000 people in Tokyo marched to the Diet, the Prime Minister's official residence, and the American Embassy to express strong protests to their two main enemies—the Kishi Nobusuke government and American imperialism, and held a conference to solemnly declare that the new "Security Treaty" was completely invalid!

At the same time, zero hour on the 19th, when Kishi Nobusuke announced that the new "Security Treaty" would "naturally take effect," was also the moment when the Japanese people vowed to continue their struggle to smash the new "Security Treaty." As the resolution passed by the Tokyo National Congress on the 18th announced, the current anger of the Japanese people is like a raging wave submerging American imperialism and Japanese reactionaries. The power of the people has formed a historical torrent that no force can stop. As the famous professor Tetsuzo Tanikawa said, the new "Security Treaty" has been rejected by the Japanese people, and it will become useless! The Japanese people have realized from the struggle the long-term nature of the struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. They said that they will continue to launch more intense struggles unyieldingly in the future to smash the conspiracy of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to establish an aggressive military alliance.

It should be pointed out that the Japanese ruling class is currently brewing new conspiracies, attempting to continue to use Kishi Nobusuke to put the treaty into effect as soon as possible after the new "Security Treaty" "naturally takes effect," and then use Kishi Nobusuke as a "scapegoat" to ease public anger and "clean up the situation," while suppressing the patriotic movement of the Japanese people and implementing the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty to realize its imperialist ambitions.

However, the Japanese people, who have continuously achieved victories in the anti-American and anti-Kishi struggle and accumulated struggle experience, know how to deal with the U.S.-Japan reactionaries. After ending the stage of preventing the amendment and ratification of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," they immediately sounded a new battle horn and pushed the anti-American and anti-Kishi struggle to a new climax. The Japanese people have put forward the future struggle goal of preventing the entry into force and implementation of the new "Security Treaty" and finally smashing this treaty. They will continue to fight towards this goal.

### 各阶层人民广泛参加斗争　迫使艾森豪威尔停止访日  日本人民第十八次统一行动获巨大胜利

    各阶层人民广泛参加斗争　迫使艾森豪威尔停止访日
    日本人民第十八次统一行动获巨大胜利
    新华社19日讯　本社记者报道：在反美反岸斗争中取得了巨大成就的日本人民第十八次全国统一行动，今天按照原订计划胜利结束。
    从11日到19日这一段期间，日本各阶层人民参加总罢工、抗议集会和示威游行的人数达一千三百万人次以上，动员参加运动的人数之众多、各阶层如此广泛地参加运动都超过了过去的十七次统一行动。这次统一行动中的成就之一是震天动地的反美浪潮终于迫使艾森豪威尔不得不停止访日，这是一年多以来日本人民在反对“安全条约”斗争中取得的初步辉煌胜利。这次胜利使日本人民更加认清美帝国主义是纸老虎的真理，从而进一步坚定信心，提高觉悟，鼓舞他们乘胜前进，继续坚持斗争。
    十八次统一行动中的六·一五总罢工，实际上是日本民主力量同日本反动派进行了一次较量。15日，当五百八十万工人在全国举行罢工、东京工人和学生到国会抗议时，岸信介政府唆使警察和法西斯匪徒袭击示威群众制造流血事件，并屠杀了一位女学生。岸信介满以为这次猛扑就可以把日本人民吓住，他便可以“风平浪静”地迎接其主子艾森豪威尔。但是，事情却向岸信介所希望的反面发展。这一流血惨案反而激起全国人民的愤怒。日本人民在受到反面教育后更加认清岸信介的凶暴面目，进一步行动起来，给日本反动派以有力反击，结果迫使岸信介暂时收敛起来。
    这次统一行动的另一个成就是对岸信介集团强使新日美“安全条约”“自然成立”的罪行进行了一次公众审判，人民用行动宣布这种“自然成立”是无效的。18日，当岸信介集团强使新“安全条约”“自然成立”的阴谋被揭露时，东京的四十万群众拥向国会、首相官邸和美国大使馆，向他们的两个主要敌人——岸信介政府和美帝国主义表示了强烈的抗议，并且举行大会庄严宣布，新“安全条约”完全无效！
    同时，岸信介宣布新“安全条约”“自然成立”的19日零时，也是日本人民誓为粉碎新“安全条约”而继续斗争的时刻。正如18日东京国民大会通过决议宣布那样，目前日本人民的怒火像狂澜巨浪一样淹没着美帝国主义和日本反动派，人民的力量已经形成历史的巨流，任何力量都不能阻挡它。著名教授谷川彻三说得好，新“安全条约”已经为日本人民所否决，它将变成无用的东西！日本人民从斗争中已经认识到反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争的长期性，他们表示今后还要不屈不挠地继续发动更加强烈的斗争，来粉碎美日反动派建立侵略性军事同盟的阴谋。
    应当指出，日本统治阶级目前正在酝酿新的阴谋，企图在新“安全条约”“自然成立”之后，继续利用岸信介使这项条约及早生效，然后再用岸信介作为“替罪羊”来缓和民愤，“收拾时局”，一面镇压日本人民的爱国运动，一面执行日美军事同盟条约、实现其帝国主义野心。
    但是，在反美反岸斗争中不断取得胜利，并且积累了斗争经验的日本人民是知道怎样来对付美日反动派的。他们在结束了阻止修改和批准新日美“安全条约”的阶段后，紧接着又吹起新的战斗号角，把反美反岸斗争推向新的高潮。日本人民已经提出今后的斗争目标是阻止新“安全条约”的生效和执行并且最后粉碎这项条约。他们将朝着这个目标继续战斗下去。
