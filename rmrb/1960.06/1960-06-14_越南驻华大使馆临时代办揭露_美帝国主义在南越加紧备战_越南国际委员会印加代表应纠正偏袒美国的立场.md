Xinhua News Agency, June 13th: Trần Trọng Quát, the Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Embassy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in China, stated at a press conference with Chinese and foreign journalists today that he demands that the Indian and Canadian representatives on the International Commission for Vietnam immediately correct their unjust position of favoring US imperialism, and stop the US imperialism's criminal actions of undermining the Geneva Accords and intensifying war preparations in South Vietnam.

Because of the Indian and Canadian representatives' bias towards the United States, the US-Ngô clique’s war preparations, which are undermining the peaceful reunification of Vietnam, creating tension in Indochina, and threatening peace in Southeast Asia, are being legitimized. The Chargé d'Affaires told reporters that the Vietnamese people will continue to wage a determined struggle to defeat the aggressive schemes of US imperialism, and he called on all peace-loving and democratic forces in the world, especially the people of Asia and Africa, to support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people.

Trần Trọng Quát introduced the tenth interim report submitted by the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference on Indochina on June 10. As previously reported, this report is an unjust resolution that undermines the Geneva Accords, forcibly passed by a majority vote of the Indian and Canadian representatives, despite the strong opposition of the Polish representative.

Trần Trọng Quát said that one of the most serious violations of the Geneva Accords is that US imperialism and the South Vietnamese authorities not only illegally maintain the "US Military Assistance Advisory Group," but also continuously increase the military personnel of this advisory group, expand armaments, create a "state of war," and massacre the people of South Vietnam. He said that the military personnel of the "US Military Assistance Advisory Group" have increased from two hundred at the beginning of the ceasefire to more than two thousand now. Such a huge "military advisory group" has essentially become the US headquarters in South Vietnam, and the command post of the Ngô Đình Diệm clique's Ministry of National Defense. It is now stepping up the implementation of plans to strengthen armaments, strengthen the organization, training, and equipment of various military forces in South Vietnam, direct the construction of military bases, warehouses, and strategic highways in South Vietnam, and at the same time direct the persecution and massacre of former resistance personnel and patriots in South Vietnam.

While increasing US military personnel, the US-Ngô clique also refuses to implement the International Commission's previous decision to withdraw the "US Temporary Equipment Replacement Team" in June 1959. This organization is essentially an illegal agency for transporting weapons into South Vietnam.

Trần Trọng Quát said that the Indian and Canadian representatives on the International Commission for Vietnam not only fail to resolutely uphold the Geneva Accords, but also disregard the opposition of the Polish representative and make unjust resolutions. This resolution believes that South Vietnam can continue to increase the military personnel of the "US Military Assistance Advisory Group" in large numbers; it allows the "US Temporary Equipment Replacement Team" to stay in South Vietnam instead of leaving, and makes a new decision to stay until the end of 1960; in addition, it believes that the Tenth Fascist Decree has nothing to do with the Geneva Accords, and does not intervene.

He stated that the Vietnamese people will more resolutely continue to strengthen their struggle to force all US military delegations to get out of South Vietnam and defeat the aggressive schemes of US imperialism.

### 越南驻华大使馆临时代办揭露  美帝国主义在南越加紧备战  越南国际委员会印加代表应纠正偏袒美国的立场

    越南驻华大使馆临时代办揭露
    美帝国主义在南越加紧备战
    越南国际委员会印加代表应纠正偏袒美国的立场
    新华社13日讯　越南民主共和国驻中国大使馆临时代办陈仲括今天在中外记者招待会上，要求越南国际委员会的印度和加拿大代表，立即纠正那种偏袒美帝国主义的不公正立场，制止美帝国主义在南越破坏日内瓦协议、加紧备战的罪恶行动。
    由于印度和加拿大代表对美国的偏袒，美吴集团破坏越南的和平统一、制造印度支那紧张局势和威胁东南亚和平的备战活动，正在合法化。这位临时代办向记者们表示，越南人民要继续进行坚决的斗争，击败美帝国主义的侵略阴谋，他并且呼吁全世界一切和平民主力量，特别是亚非各国人民，支持越南人民的正义斗争。
    陈仲括在会上介绍了越南国际监察和监督委员会6月10日公布的向关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议两位主席提交的第十次临时报告。前已报道，这个报告是由于印度和加拿大的代表不顾波兰代表的强烈反对，以多数票强行通过的一个破坏日内瓦协议的不公正的决议。
    陈仲括说，最严重违反日内瓦协议事件之一的是美帝国主义和南越当局不仅非法地保持着“美国军事援助顾问团”，而且还不断地增加这个顾问团的军事人员，扩充军备，制造“战争状态”，并屠杀越南南方的人民。他说，“美国军事援助顾问团”的军事人员，已由停战初期的二百人增加到现在的二千多人。这样庞大的“军事顾问团”，实质上已成了美国在南越的总司令部，成了吴庭艳集团国防部的指挥部，现在它正在加紧执行加强军备的计划，加强南越各种军事力量的组织、训练和装备，指挥南越的军事基地、仓库和战略公路的修建，同时指挥对越南南方前抗战人员和爱国人士进行迫害和屠杀。
    在增加美国军事人员的同时，美吴集团还拒绝执行国际委员会以前决定的在1959年6月撤走“美国临时装备更新团”的决议。这个组织实质上是一种非法运输武器进入南越的机构。
    陈仲括说，越南国际委员会的印度和加拿大代表不但不坚决拥护日内瓦协议，反而不顾波兰代表的反对，作出了不公正的决议。这个决议认为南越可以继续大量增加“美国军事援助顾问团”的军事人员；它允许“美国临时装备更新团”赖在南越不走，而作出了留至1960年底的新决议；另外还认为第十号法西斯法令与日内瓦协议无关，而不加干预。
    他表示，越南人民将愈加坚决地继续加强斗争，迫使美国一切军事代表团从越南南方滚出去，击败美帝国主义的侵略阴谋。
