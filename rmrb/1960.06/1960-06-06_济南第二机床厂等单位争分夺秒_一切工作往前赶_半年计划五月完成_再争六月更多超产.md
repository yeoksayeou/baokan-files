Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 5th: The Jinan No. 2 Machine Tool Plant has completed its first half of the year production plan ahead of schedule and with overfulfillment. Statistics as of the end of May show that the total output value exceeded the plan by 28.4%, an increase of 28.9% compared to the same period last year; labor productivity exceeded the plan by 26%, an increase of 54% compared to the same period last year; the output of the main product, gantry planers, increased more than threefold compared to the same period last year; and the cost of comparable products decreased by 9.2% compared to the same period last year, and 6.2% lower than planned.

At the beginning of this year, the Party Committee of this plant formulated effective measures of "One Early and Three Grasps".

One Early means grasping planning arrangements early, starting from the beginning of the year and grasping tightly, and grasping tightly every month, implementing throughout the year. Three Grasps are: Grasp ideology, grasp the improvement of work style of leading cadres, and grasp management work.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 5th: The workers of the Shandong Yellow River Shipping Bureau fought a great battle in Red May, conquering the Yellow River's low water, and have overfulfilled the second quarter's transportation turnover plan thirty-eight days ahead of schedule.

In April and May, the Yellow River experienced unprecedented low water levels, making navigation extremely difficult for motorized vessels, and even wooden sailboats could only transport half loads. They organized a large number of obstacle clearing teams and blasting teams to blast away clay, clear reefs, deepen the riverbed, and open up waterways. They also vigorously promoted advanced experiences such as raft transportation and ship-towed raft transportation, and built and used large numbers of shallow-draft, fast-moving fish-belly boats, canvas boats, and various simple small wooden sailboats for transportation, finally completing three months' worth of plans in two months.

This newspaper reports: The advanced collective of the Baotou Mining Bureau's Daci Coal Mine, which attended the National Heroes Conference, had completed half of its annual production task as of June 3rd, producing 410,000 tons of raw coal, an increase of 32.5% compared to the same period last year. Other economic indicators have also greatly improved compared to last year.

The reason why this mine was able to complete the first half of the year's production task ahead of schedule is mainly that the mine leaders used the scientific and forward-looking leadership method of "looking ten feet ahead after walking one foot," doing things early rather than late, and ahead rather than behind, grasping everything in advance, and starting early in every aspect. In addition, they have continuously improved enterprise management and persisted in the system of leading cadres following production shifts and general cadres participating in labor; they have adopted the "three-combination" method to solve key problems and weak links, resulting in the monthly overfulfillment of the plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 5th: As of May 31st, the Changsha Automobile Electrical Appliance Factory in Changsha City, Hunan Province, had completed 52.12% of its annual output plan and 52.18% of its output value plan. The output and output value for these five months were 610% and 305.6% of the same period last year, respectively; labor productivity, profits, costs, quality and other indicators have also completed the first half of the year's plan.

Since the beginning of this year, the factory's workers have launched a technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on "four comparisons" targeting key production issues, which has greatly improved the degree of mechanization and automation. The workers have also vigorously promoted the advanced experiences and advanced technologies of this factory and other factories and regions, thus greatly increasing production.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 5th: Huainan Coal Mine has completed the first half of the year's national coking plan forty-three days ahead of schedule. As of May 23rd, it has completed more than 50% of the annual national coke production plan; other economic indicators have also been comprehensively successful. Compared with the same period last year, the overall efficiency has increased by 47%, the cost has decreased by 2.25%, the ash content has decreased by 1.7%, and the coke coking rate has increased by 9.8%.

At the beginning of this year, the Huainan Coal Mine's coking plants repaired more than 40% of the original coke ovens and built a new batch of furnaces, expanding production capacity.

In order to ensure the completion of the production plan on a daily, ten-day, and monthly basis, leading cadres at all levels went to the front line to direct production, closely grasping the daily shift operation plan, especially focusing on the first ten days of each month and the first shift of each day, so that all work was rushed forward, promoting the early completion of the production plan.

This is a large number of vacuum oil diffusion pumps produced by the new non-cutting processing technology. Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Ping photo.

The Daxinganling Forest Area in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region had completed 50% of this year's annual timber production plan on April 21st. These are a large number of timbers in the storage yard, which are about to be loaded onto vehicles and transported to all parts of the motherland.

    济南第二机床厂等单位争分夺秒　一切工作往前赶
    半年计划五月完成　再争六月更多超产
    据新华社济南5日电　济南第二机床厂已提前超额完成今年上半年生产计划。截至5月底统计，总产值超额28．4％，比去年同期增长28．9％；劳动生产率超额26％，比去年同期增长54％；主要产品龙门刨床的产量比去年同期增长三倍以上；可比产品成本比去年同期降低9．2％，比计划降低6．2％。
    今年一开始，这个厂的党委就制订了“一早三抓”的有效措施。
    一早就是早抓计划安排，从年初一开始就抓紧，并且月月抓紧，贯彻全年。三抓是：抓思想、抓领导干部改进作风、抓管理工作。
    据新华社济南5日电　山东黄河航运局职工大战红5月，降服黄河枯水，已提前三十八天超额完成了第二季度运输周转量计划。
    4、5月份黄河空前枯水，机动船舶航行极为困难，木帆船也只能半载运输。他们组织了大批扫障队、爆破队，炸除胶泥，扫除礁石，加深河床，开辟航路。又大力推广排筏运输、以船带筏运输等先进经验，大造大用吃水小、行动快的鱼肚船、帆布船和各种简易小型木帆船运输，终于在两个月内完成了三个月的计划。
    本报讯　出席全国群英会的先进集体包头矿务局大磁煤矿截至6月3日，已完成全年生产任务的一半，共产原煤四十一万吨，比去年同期增长了32．5％，其它经济指标也都较去年大有提高。
    这个矿所以能提前完成上半年生产任务，主要是矿领导运用了“走一尺看一丈”的科学预见性的领导方法，赶早不赶晚，赶前不赶后，事事提前抓，处处早动手。此外，还不断改进企业管理，坚持了领导干部跟班生产，一般干部参加劳动的制度；对关键问题和薄弱环节采取“三结合”的方法解决，致使月月超额完成计划。
    据新华社长沙5日电　湖南省长沙市长沙汽车电器厂到5月31日止，已完成全年产量计划的52．12％，产值计划的52．18％，这五个月的产量和产值分别为去年同期的610％和305．6％；劳动生产率、利润、成本、质量等指标，也都完成了上半年计划。
    今年以来，这个厂的职工针对生产关键，开展以“四比”为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，使机械化和自动化程度大大提高。职工们还大力推广了本厂和外厂、外地的先进经验和先进技术，因此，生产大幅度地提高。
    据新华社合肥5日电　淮南煤矿已提前四十三天完成上半年国家炼焦计划。截至5月23日止，已完成全年国家焦炭生产计划的50％以上；其他各项经济指标也都全面告捷，与去年同期比较，全员效率提高47％，成本降低2．25％，灰分降低1．7％，焦炭结焦率提高9．8％。
