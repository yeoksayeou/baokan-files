Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 1st. Soviet newspapers "Izvestia" and "Soviet Russia" published commentaries pointing out the great significance of the struggles of the people of South Korea, Japan, and Turkey against U.S. imperialism and domestic reactionaries.

    "Izvestia's" commentary said that the land under imperialism is burning. The rulers of imperialist countries often use the words "free world," which is a wolf disguising itself with a sheep's skin. Recently, very important political events have occurred in some U.S. imperialist vassal states, the so-called "free and democratic countries" that U.S. imperialism clamors about. Political turmoil has occurred in many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. America's "friends" have successively suffered devastating defeats, and the anger of the people has swept across the puppets of the masters on the other side of the ocean. "Izvestia" used a large amount of material to expose the facts of the collusion between U.S. imperialism and the South Korean, Japanese, and Turkish reactionaries. The newspaper wrote that U.S. imperialism and its running dogs have failed to stop the flames of anger of the Turkish people. This anger is also growing in other countries of the so-called "free world."

    The June 1st "Izvestia" wrote in a commentary on the situation in South Korea that the shameful failure of Syngman Rhee and all his henchmen provides a wealth of factual material to illustrate the true situation of the "free world." The collapse of the dictator fostered by the United States is not a personal and accidental failure, but the complete bankruptcy of the entire Asian plan of the U.S. Pentagon and the State Department.

    The newspaper continued that in our era, nothing can save the inevitable collapse of the system supported by the U.S. reactionary group.

    The newspaper said that the U.S. President called his South Korean partner a "great man," but this American running dog sneaked away from Seoul. Now U.S. leaders are counting on the Huh Chung caretaker cabinet. Huh Chung began to climb up the ladder under foreign occupation. The interim government that emerged after the collapse of Syngman Rhee's rule expressed its allegiance to the United States. Huh Chung and his government stated that they would suppress the people more resolutely than Syngman Rhee. "Izvestia" pointed out, "Indeed, that's how Syngman Rhee started! If the United States wants to put someone on the throne who only pleases the Pentagon, then the question will soon arise: 'If the president ran away from Seoul, who will be next?'"

    "Soviet Russia" wrote in a commentary on June 1st entitled "The Typhoon of Anger" that a real typhoon of anger has swept across Japan, and the "prestige" of the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet has completely collapsed.

    苏联报纸评南朝鲜、日本和土耳其人民的斗争
    人民愤怒的浪潮冲击美国傀儡  帝国主义脚下的土地燃烧起来
    新华社莫斯科1日电　苏联“消息报”、“苏维埃俄罗斯报”发表评论，指出南朝鲜、日本和土耳其人民反对美帝国主义和国内反动派的斗争的重大意义。
    “消息报”的评论说，帝国主义脚下的土地燃烧起来了。帝国主义国家的统治者经常使用“自由世界”字样，这是狼披上一张羊皮来伪装自己。最近在一些美帝国主义附庸国家，也就是美帝国主义所叫嚷的所谓“自由和民主国家”里发生了极重要的政治事件。亚、非、拉丁美洲许多国家发生了政治动荡。美国的“朋友们”相继遭受到崩溃性的失败，人民的愤怒横扫大洋彼岸主子的傀儡们。“消息报”用大量材料揭露了美帝国主义和南朝鲜、日本及土耳其反动派狼狈为奸的事实。报纸写道，美帝国主义及其走狗们未能制止土耳其人民愤怒的火焰。这种愤怒也在所谓“自由世界”其他国家内增长着。
    6月1日的“消息报”在评论南朝鲜局势时写道，李承晚和他的所有党徒的可耻失败提供了大量的事实材料，来说明“自由世界”的真实情况。美国所扶植的独裁者的垮台不是个人的和偶然的失败，而是美国五角大楼和国务院的整个亚洲计划正在彻底破产。
    报纸接着写道，在我们的时代里，任何东西都不能挽救美国反动集团支持的制度的必然崩溃。
    报纸说，美国总统把他的南朝鲜的伙伴称之为“伟人”，但是这个美国的走狗偷偷地从汉城溜走了。现在美国领导人又指望许政看守内阁。许政开始在外国占领的条件下往上爬。在李承晚的统治崩溃之后出现的临时政府表示效忠于美国。许政和他的政府表示，他们将比李承晚更加坚决地镇压人民。“消息报”指出，不错，李承晚也就是这样开始的！如果美国还要把只使五角大楼满意的人推上宝座的话，那么，不久就会出现这样的问题：“如果总统从汉城逃跑了。下一个将是谁呢？”“苏维埃俄罗斯报”1日在一篇题为“愤怒的台风”的评论中写道，真正的愤怒的台风席卷了整个日本，岸信介内阁的“威信”已经彻底垮台了。
