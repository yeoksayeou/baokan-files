    This newspaper reports: The Beijing Coal Mine Design Institute has quickly applied the technical innovation achievements created by the broad masses to design, after improving and coordinating them. In the past four months, they have adopted 200 advanced experiences in only three preliminary designs and some mine construction drawings. Compared with the original designs, the new designs save more than 6 million yuan in construction investment, more than 4,000 tons of steel, and more than 16,000 cubic meters of wood, while production efficiency has increased by one to three times.

    Initially, the Party committee of the institute first organized designers to summarize and generalize the 48 advanced experiences created by coal mine workers in various places, and designed a mine that fully adopted new technologies. The production efficiency was 1.5 times higher than the original design, the investment per ton of coal was reduced by half, and more than 1,000 tons of steel and cement were saved. This typical design made the designers further realize the importance of quickly reflecting the innovation achievements created by the masses in the design. The Party committee then organized 60% of the designers in the institute into five on-site working teams to go to coal mines such as Fengfeng and Datong, and combined them with the leading cadres and workers of the coal mines, and cooperated with geological, production, construction, power, and railway departments to jointly study and design new mine designs that adopt new technologies, new structures, new norms, new materials, new theories, and new styles. They also formed a "learning" roving working team to collect innovation achievements created by workers and masses in various places. In the past four months, they have collected more than 2,000 advanced experiences in more than 100 factories, mines, and design institutes. After sorting and improving, most of them have been applied to the design.

    Based on the principles of seriousness, conscientiousness, and seeking truth from facts, they conducted investigation, research and production experiments when applying each innovation achievement. For example, when they heard that coal mine workers had created a one-stop fast loading method, they immediately went to coal mines in Fuxin, Yangquan, and other places to conduct investigation and research. After returning to the institute, they revised all the design drawings of the coal loading system of all mines to use this new loading method, shortening the average coal loading time for each train from one and a half hours to less than 30 minutes. Some designers also made new creations under the inspiration of the masses: for example, the designers working in Huainan Coal Mine found that the "shield support" new coal mining method of unmanned, without pit wood, and without chain conveyor was very good, but it could only be used in steeply inclined coal seams. After collective research and improvement, this coal mining method can now also be used in gently inclined coal seams.

    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 26th: The Northwest Industrial Architectural Design Institute has combined the internal and external movements in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, organized designers to participate in the innovation movement of relevant factories, and timely summarized and absorbed new technical achievements into the new plant design.

    Last winter, the Northwest Design Institute launched a technical innovation movement centered on six new aspects (new theories, new styles, new structures, new technologies, new materials, and new equipment), and achieved great success. The technical level of new plant design has been greatly improved. However, due to the rapid development of the national technical revolution movement, the technical norms, equipment, and technologies of various industrial sectors are changing rapidly. What was advanced yesterday is often backward today. In order to prevent the new plant from becoming an object of revolution as soon as it is built, the Party Committee of the Northwest Industrial Architectural Design Institute determined to fully absorb the achievements of technical innovation and technical revolution and timely incorporate them into the design. Subsequently, designers went to factories and construction sites one after another. The Party committee also introduced the personnel sent to factories to the Party organizations in the factories, and carried out work under the unified leadership of the local Party, and participated in the technical revolution movement there. It was not like in the past, reaching out to ask others for things, "visiting" and "being a guest"; but participating in innovation in a down-to-earth manner, striving to learn from workers, and helping to summarize experience and improve technical theory.

    The Northwest Industrial Architectural Design Institute is responsible for the design of ceramic factories across the country. The ceramic industry in our country is an industrial sector with a poor foundation. In the past, some factories were manually operated, so in the design of new factories, most of them used foreign technologies, equipment, and data. In the national technical revolution movement, this situation has fundamentally changed. When designing a ceramic factory in Guangdong, the design institute originally planned to use imported equipment to mechanize the washing and selection work; after the designers participated in the technical innovation of the Jingdezhen Architectural Ceramic Factory, on the basis of the workers' suggestion, they jointly researched and trial-produced a ceramic hydraulic rotary washing and selection machine, which mechanized the wet operation of washing and selecting kaolin, which affects workers' health. In the past, manual washing and selection averaged only one ton of slurry per day, but now one person can wash 100 to 200 tons per day. The efficiency is equal to that of imported equipment, but the value is only one-tenth of that of imported copper equipment. Now, the design institute has selected it for use in the design.

    Some designers used to think that manually operated factories had little to learn from the design of new mechanized ceramic factories, but now they have fundamentally changed this view. At the beginning of last year, someone suggested using air compressors instead of slurry pumps to transport slurry. One air compressor can replace several slurry pumps, but after a year of exploration and experimentation, no definite conclusion was reached. Later, they discovered that Beijing Ceramic Factory had already officially adopted this equipment, so they decided to formally adopt it. Now, whenever they encounter difficulties, they actively look for solutions from the technical revolution movement of various factories.

    The technical innovation and technical revolution within the Northwest Design Institute are also closely integrated with the movements of various factories. Taking the current problems in the actual production of the ceramic industry as the scientific research and technical innovation topics of the institute, a special working group was sent to ceramic industry concentrated areas such as Tangshan and Shenyang for research. The working group in Tangshan assisted local factories in researching the project of manufacturing machinery with ceramics instead of steel, and achieved remarkable results. Various ceramic handling and mechanical equipment have been selected in the design of several newly built ceramic factories in Yixing, Jiangxi, and other places.

    Using the actual experience outside the institute to promote scientific research within the institute, and using internal innovation to supplement and improve external creation; this kind of internal and external coordination has played a great role in rapidly improving the degree of mechanization.

    满腔热情吸取革新成果  认真严肃坚持调查试验
    北京煤矿设计院西北建筑设计院内外结合革新工程设计
    本报讯　北京煤矿设计院把广大群众创造的技术革新成果，经过提高、配套，迅速运用到设计中去。四个月来，他们仅在三个初步设计和部分矿井施工图纸中，就采用了二百项先进经验。新设计同原来的设计相比，节省建设投资六百多万元，钢材四千多吨，木材一万六千多立米，而生产效率却提高一倍到三倍。
    开始时，院党委先组织设计人员把各地煤矿职工创造的四十八项先进经验，加以综合归纳，设计了一座全部采用新技术的矿井，生产效率比原设计提高一倍半，每吨煤投资降低一半，钢材、水泥节约一千多吨。这一典型设计，使设计人员进一步认识了迅速把群众创造的革新成果反映到设计上去的重要性。院党委接着把全院60％的设计人员组成五个下现场工作队，分赴峰峰、大同等煤矿，和煤矿的领导干部、工人结合在一起，并同地质、生产、施工、电力、铁路部门协作，共同研究设计采用新工艺、新结构、新定额、新材料、新理论、新风格的新型矿井设计。他们还组成一个“取经”巡回工作队，分赴各地搜集职工群众创造的革新成果。四个月来，他们已在一百多个工厂、矿山和设计院中，收集到两千多项先进经验，经过整理提高，绝大部分都已运用到设计上去。
    根据严肃认真、实事求是的原则，他们运用每项革新成果时，都经过调查研究和生产试验。例如，他们听到煤矿工人创造了一条龙快速装车法，就立即分赴阜新、阳泉等煤矿调查研究，回院以后，把所有的矿井装煤系统的设计图纸，都改用这种新装车法，使每列车的装煤时间，平均从一个半小时缩短到三十分钟以内。有的设计人员还在群众创造的启发下，进行了新的创造：如在淮南煤矿工作的设计人员，发现无人、无坑木、无链板运输机的“掩护支架”新采煤法很好，但是它只能在急倾斜的煤层里使用。经过他们集体研究改进，现在这种采煤法在缓倾斜的煤层里也能应用了。
    本报西安26日电　西北工业建筑设计院在技术革新与技术革命运动中，使院内运动与院外运动相结合，组织设计人员参加有关工厂的革新运动，及时地总结汲取新的技术成果，纳入新厂设计。
    去年冬季，西北设计院就展开了以六新（新理论、新风格、新结构、新工艺、新材料、新设备）为中心的技术革新运动，取得了很大成就。新厂设计的技术水平有很大提高。但是由于全国技术革命运动发展迅速，各个工业部门的技术定额、设备和工艺，都是时新日异。往往昨天先进的，今天就落后了。为了不使新厂在刚刚建成就成为革命对象，中共西北工业建筑设计院党委确定要充分吸取技术革新与技术革命的成果，及时纳入设计。接着，设计人员便纷纷下厂下工地。院党委并把下厂人员介绍到所在厂的党组织，在当地党的统一领导下进行工作，就参加那里的技术革命运动。不是像过去那样，伸手去向人家要东西，“参观”、“作客”；而是踏踏实实参加革新，努力向工人学习，帮助总结经验和在技术理论上提高。
    西北工业建筑设计院担负了全国的陶瓷工厂设计。陶瓷工业在我国是一个基础较差的工业部门。过去有一些工厂是手工操作，因此在新厂设计中，大都是选用国外工艺，设备和数据。在全国技术革命运动中，这种情况根本改变了。在为广东某陶瓷厂作设计时，设计院本来打算选用进口设备来使洗选工作机械化的；设计人员到景德镇建筑陶瓷厂参加技术革新以后，在工人建议的基础上，共同研究试制成功了一种陶瓷的水力回旋洗选机，使洗选高岭土这一影响工人健康的湿法作业机械化了。以前人工洗选，一天平均只有一吨多泥浆，现在一个人一天可洗一百到二百吨，效率和进口设备相等，而价值仅及进口的铜制设备的十分之一。现在，设计院已经把它选用到设计中来了。
  有些设计人员以前认为手工操作的工厂对设计机械化的新陶瓷厂没有多少东西可以借鉴，现在根本改变了这种看法。去年初曾经有人建议用空气压缩机代替泥浆泵输送泥浆。一台空气压缩机就可以代替几台泥浆泵，但经过一年的探讨试验，也没有作出肯定的结论。后来他们发现北京陶瓷厂早已正式采用这种设备了，于是，才决定正式采用。现在他们每当遇有难题，就积极地从各厂的技术革命运动中找办法。
    西北设计院院内的技术革新与技术革命，也与各工厂的运动密切结合。以当前陶瓷工业生产实际中的问题作为本院的科学研究和技术革新课题，专门派出工作组到陶瓷工业集中地区如唐山、沈阳等地进行研究。在唐山的工作组协助当地各厂研究以陶瓷代钢铁制造机械的研究项目，获得了显著成绩。在宜兴、江西等几个新建陶瓷厂设计中已经选用了各种陶瓷搬运和机械设备。
    以院外的实际经验促进院内的科学研究，以院内革新补充提高院外的创造；这样内外配套，对迅速提高机械化程度起了很大的作用。（附图片）
