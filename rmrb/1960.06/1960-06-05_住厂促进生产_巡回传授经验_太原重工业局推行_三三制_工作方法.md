　　This newspaper reports To resolutely realize the fighting goal of "May exceeding April, June exceeding May, Second Quarter exceeding First Quarter, and a great leap forward in July," the Taiyuan Heavy Industry Bureau actively improved its leadership style, went deep into the lower levels, and effectively promoted production.

　　On the basis of vigorously streamlining meetings and business reports, the bureau promoted the "Three-Three System" work method among leaders and cadres throughout the bureau. The so-called "Three-Three System" means that one-third of the personnel in the bureau take turns leaving the office to go deep into factories and mines, living, eating, and working with the workers and masses, in order to grasp production conditions in a timely manner, discover problems in a timely manner, and solve them on the spot; one-third of the personnel form a "look at the flowers while riding a horse" roving inspection team, going to the bureau's affiliated factories and mines to inspect work, understand the development of the production upsurge, discover and disseminate advanced experiences of various units in a timely manner, and organize forces to break through weak links, ensuring sustained leap forward in production; one-third of the personnel insist on handling daily business work in the office, keeping in contact with the stationed personnel, summarizing the overall situation, and providing reference for leaders to grasp the overall situation and improve work.

　　Due to the implementation of the "Three-Three System" work method, many key problems were solved for various units in a timely manner. For example, in the first half of May, the Taiyuan Coking Plant's coking output declined due to coal washing not keeping up with demand and furnace temperature not rising, only completing 35% of the monthly plan in the first half of the month. In order to help reverse this situation, Zhang Huichuan, Deputy Director of the Heavy Industry Bureau, personally went into action with his luggage, staying at the plant to understand the specific situation. Under the unified leadership of the plant's Party committee, he and the workers and masses studied the problems, formulated measures, and fiercely tackled technical barriers, promoting a significant increase in daily production levels, completing 65% of the monthly plan in the second half of the month. Another example is that during the red May production campaign, the Taiyuan Cement Plant was threatened with failure to complete its production tasks due to a lack of water slag. After the workers tried every means to come up with solutions, they proposed using bricks and tiles to replace water slag. However, the transportation problem could not be solved, making it impossible to implement. At this critical moment, the comrades working in the factory immediately took measures, transferring five trucks to provide support, ensuring the timely supply of raw materials, greatly boosting the workers' labor enthusiasm. Everyone worked with doubled efforts, overfulfilling the May production plan and realizing the leap forward slogan of May exceeding April.

　　Due to the change in the bureau's leadership style, the daily production level of various units in the bureau was effectively promoted, ensuring the over-fulfillment of the bureau's May production tasks.

    住厂促进生产　巡回传授经验
    太原重工业局推行“三三制”工作方法
    本报讯　为了坚决实现“5月超4月，6月超5月，二季超一季，7月大飞跃”的战斗目标，太原市重工业局积极改进领导作风，深入下层，有效地促进了生产。
    这个局在大力精简会议和业务表报的基础上，在全局领导和干部中推行了“三三制”工作方法。所谓“三三制”就是全局三分之一的人员轮流走出办公室，深入厂矿和职工群众同吃、同住、同劳动，以便及时掌握生产情况，及时发现问题，当场进行解决；三分之一的人员组成走马观花巡回检查队，到局属各厂矿检查工作，了解生产高潮的发展情况，发现和及时传播各单位的先进经验，组织力量突破薄弱环节，保证生产持续跃进；三分之一的人员坚持在机关处理日常业务工作，和驻厂人员联系，对全面情况进行汇总，供领导掌握全局、改进工作的参考。
    由于“三三制”工作方法的推行，及时帮助各单位解决了许多关键问题。如太原焦化厂5月上半月因洗煤赶不上需要，炉温又上不去，炉产量日益下降，上半月只完成了月计划的35％。为了帮助扭转这一局面，重工业局张汇川副局长背上行李亲自出马，长住该厂了解具体情况，在厂党委统一领导下，他和职工群众一道研究问题，拟定措施，猛攻技术关，促进日产水平大大上升，下半月完成了月计划的65％。又如太原水泥厂在大战红5月中，因为缺乏水渣，直接威胁着生产任务的完成。经过职工们千方百计想办法，提出以砖头瓦片代替水渣。但运输问题解决不了，无法实现。在这紧要关头，局驻厂工作的同志立即采取措施，抽调了五辆汽车前往支援，保证了原材料的及时供应，大大鼓舞了该厂职工的劳动热情，个个以加倍的干劲，超额完成了5月份生产计划，实现了5月超4月的跃进口号。
    由于该局领导作风的改变，有力地促进了全局各单位日产水平的不断提高，保证了全局5月份生产任务的超额完成。
