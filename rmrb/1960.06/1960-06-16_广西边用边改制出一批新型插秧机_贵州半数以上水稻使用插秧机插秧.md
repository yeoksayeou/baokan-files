Guangxi Produces a Batch of New-Type Rice Transplanters While Using and Improving Them
Guizhou Uses Rice Transplanters for More Than Half of Its Rice Seedlings
Vigorously promoting rice transplanters accelerates the transplanting progress, saves labor, and reduces labor intensity. The masses sing about rice transplanters like this: "Rice transplanters plant seedlings neatly, holding the machine and singing songs, a burst of singing fills the green fields, the more we plant, the happier we are."

Nanning, June 15th (This newspaper) - The mass movement in Guangxi to manufacture and promote rice transplanters, after consolidation and improvement, has gradually moved towards industrialization and specialization. This guarantees the quality of rice transplanters from a technical and organizational standpoint, promotes better use, and prepares for the widespread use of rice transplanters for late rice transplanting.

Since the beginning of this year, more than 200,000 rice transplanters of various models have been manufactured in various parts of the autonomous region, of which more than 50,000 have been promoted and used in early rice transplanting, with a total machine-transplanted area of 410,000 mu. Not only is the transplanting efficiency high and the technical specifications uniform, but the seedlings also grow well, making it easier to use weeding tools than hand-transplanted fields. After the practice of early rice transplanting and further research and improvement by manufacturers and users, many innovations have been made to the original models of rice transplanters. In order to apply these new achievements of technical innovation to production in a timely manner, after early rice transplanting, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Party Committee instructed various localities to vigorously consolidate the achievements of using rice transplanters for early rice, improve and enhance the technical achievements already obtained, and on this basis, manufacture a new batch of better new-type rice transplanters to welcome late rice transplanting. Over the past few months, thousands of cadres, technicians, and rice transplanter operators throughout the region have formed medical teams to meet in fields and factories to study and improve rice transplanters, achieving many new accomplishments. In mid-April, the Rural Work Department of the Autonomous Region Party Committee and relevant departments convened an on-site meeting in Munan Commune, Ningming County, to evaluate and summarize rice transplanters throughout the region, selecting a batch of the best rice transplanters. Among them, the "Wuming Type 59-3" manufactured by Wuming County was the best improved. Whether it is the seedling separation, seedling delivery, or transplanting components, it has more advantages than the original finalized "Guangxi 59-3 Type." It not only further overcomes the shortcomings of the existing rice transplanters, such as poor uniformity, low seedling qualification rate, unreliable machine performance when operating quickly, and a higher number of missed seedlings, but also reduces steel consumption, making manufacturing simpler and operation more convenient. According to multiple field tests and the practice of rushing to transplant intermediate rice, the seedlings transplanted by this type of rice transplanter are upright, evenly divided, and the seedling damage rate is generally 2%, with a maximum of no more than 5%. The qualified rate of effective seedlings reaches over 80%, and the missed seedling rate is below 2%. Therefore, the meeting decided to promote it universally. After the meeting, activities to vigorously improve the original rice transplanters and imitate the new-type rice transplanters were widely carried out. By the end of May, the counties in the Nanning Special Zone alone had imitated more than 16,000 "Wuming Type 59-3" rice transplanters.

(This newspaper) Guiyang - Guizhou Province adheres to the use of rice transplanters, fully utilizes the role of rice transplanters, and implements the policy of "machine transplanting as the main method and manual transplanting as the auxiliary method" to greatly accelerate the transplanting speed of intermediate rice and ensure the quality of transplanting. Although the province has suffered from repeated attacks of drought and cold waves this year, affecting the growth of autumn seedlings, the intermediate rice transplanting season was delayed until mid-May before it began fully. However, due to the great power of rice transplanters, the progress of intermediate rice transplanting is still very rapid. As of May 26, the province's rice transplanting area has reached more than 2 million mu, of which machine transplanting accounts for 60.2%. The Tongren Special Zone has machine-transplanted 81.2% of the transplanted area, ranking first in the province. Rongjiang County, where transplanting progress was slow last year, used rice transplanters on a large scale this year, completing transplanting in just 22 days on May 23. After 40,000 rice transplanters in the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture went into action, on May 22, the labor input was one-third less than the same period last year, while the transplanted area increased by one-half. The transplanting quality in various places is generally better than last year. The rice fields are generally plowed and harrowed three times, and some are plowed and harrowed four times. Approximately 5,000 jin of high-quality base fertilizer is applied per mu, most of which has been soil熏, and the transplanting density has been significantly increased, generally reaching around 25,000 nests. Most of the machine-transplanted seedlings have met the requirements of dense, uniform, straight, shallow, and stable, with fewer floating and missed seedlings, rapid greening, and good growth and development, laying a foundation for a bumper rice harvest this year.

Guizhou Province has attached great importance to the promotion and use of rice transplanters this year. As early as mid-April, the province had overfulfilled the manufacturing task of 300,000 rice transplanters for this year and trained more than 660,000 rice transplanter operators. Therefore, at the beginning of transplanting, various localities regarded adhering to the use of rice transplanters as an important weapon in striving for high transplanting speed. Jianhe County organized more than 100 machine transplanting professional teams, implementing the method of dedicated personnel, dedicated machines, and dedicated use, and organized cadres, iron and wood workers, technicians, and rice transplanter operators to jointly conduct field performances, improving while using, so that all 2,500 rice transplanters in the county were used. According to statistics, more than 200,000 rice transplanters have been used successively throughout the province, and the average work efficiency is at least more than double that of manual transplanting. This has created extremely favorable conditions for accelerating transplanting progress, saving labor, and reducing physical labor. Farmers sing about rice transplanters, saying: "Rice transplanters plant seedlings neatly, holding the machine and singing songs, a burst of singing fills the green fields, the more we plant, the happier we are," vividly expressing the happy mood of farmers after being freed from the pain of bending over and hand-transplanting for thousands of years. In addition, various localities promptly organize manual transplanting in a few rice fields that are temporarily not suitable for rice transplanters or where rice transplanters are insufficient, so as to plow one field and transplant one field, without missing the transplanting season and accelerating the overall transplanting progress.

In order to adapt to the large-scale use of machine transplanting, various localities have adopted a variety of labor organization forms suitable for machine transplanting. In the Anshun Special Zone, counties organize machine transplanting professional teams with people's communes and production teams as units, and establish professional teams for pulling, washing, loading, transporting, and transplanting to improve work efficiency and reduce auxiliary labor. Various places in the Tongren Special Zone have established more than 2,500 "one-stop" professional transplanting teams, with transplanting groups of five people each under the team, responsible for five processes: pulling, transporting, loading, transplanting, and replanting.

    广西边用边改制出一批新型插秧机
    贵州半数以上水稻使用插秧机插秧
    大力推广插秧机，既加速了插秧进度，节约了劳力，又减轻了劳动强度。群众这样歌唱插秧机：秧机插秧窝对窝，手扶秧机口唱歌，一阵歌声满田绿，越插心里越快活。
    本报南宁15日电　广西制造推广水稻插秧机的群众运动，经过整顿巩固提高，已逐步走上工厂化与专业队化，它从技术组织上保证了插秧机的质量和更好地推广使用，为晚稻插秧普遍推广使用插秧机作好准备。
    今年以来，自治区各地共制造各种型号的插秧机二十多万部，其中有五万多部在早稻插秧中已推广使用，机插面积共四十一万多亩，不仅插秧工效高，技术规格整齐，而且禾苗生长良好，比手插田更便于使用耘田器耘田。经过早稻插秧的实践，经过制造人与使用人进一步的研究改进，原来型号的插秧机，又有不少革新。为了把这些技术革新的新成果及时运用到生产中去，在早稻插秧后，中共广西僮族自治区党委就指示各地，大力巩固早稻使用插秧机的成果，把已得到的技术成就加以改进和提高，并在这一基础上，再制造出一批更好的新型插秧机，迎接晚稻插秧。几个月来，全区成千上万的干部、技术员和插秧机手组成医疗队，会师田头、工厂研究改进插秧机，取得许多新的成就。4月中，自治区党委农村部及有关部门在宁明县睦南公社召开了全区插秧机评比总结现场会议，评选出一批最好的插秧机。其中，以武鸣县制造的“武鸣式59—3型”改进的最好。无论分秧、送秧、插秧等部件比原来定型的“广西59—3型”有更多的优点。它不仅使现存插秧机均匀度较差，秧苗合格率低，操作快时机子的可靠性不高，容易出现较多的漏秧等缺点得以进一步克服，并且减少了钢材，使制造更加简单，操作更为方便。据多次临田试验和中稻抢插实践表明，这种插秧机插的秧苗正直，分的均匀，伤秧率一般在2％，最高不超过5％，有效秧苗合格率达80％以上，漏秧率2％以下，因此，会议决定普遍推广。会后大力改进原有插秧机，仿制新型插秧机的活动便广泛开展。到5月底，仅南宁专区各县，就仿制出一万六千多部“武鸣式59—3型”插秧机。
    本报讯　贵州省坚持使用插秧机，充分发挥插秧机的作用，实行以“机插为主，手插为辅”的两条腿走路的方针，大大加快了中稻插秧速度，保证了插秧质量。虽然今年全省遭受干旱和寒潮轮番侵袭，影响秋苗成长，中稻栽秧季节推迟到5月中旬才陆续全面开始，但由于插秧机大显威风，中稻移栽进度仍然很快。到5月26日，全省水稻移栽面积已达二百多亩，其中机插占60．2％。铜仁专区机插占已插面积81．2％，居全省第一。去年栽秧进度迟缓的榕江县，今年大用插秧机，突击二十二天就在5月23日插完秧。黔东南苗族侗族自治州四万部插秧机上阵后，在5月22日这天，投入劳力比去年同期少三分之一，插秧面积反而增加二分之一。各地插秧质量一般都比去年好。稻田一般三犁三耙，部分四犁四耙；每亩施放优质底肥约五千斤，大多数经过熏土，栽插密度有显著提高，普遍达到二万五千窝左右。机插秧苗大部分达到了密、匀、直、浅、稳的要求，漂秧漏秧少，返青快，生长发育良好，为今年水稻大丰收打下了基础。
    贵州省今年十分重视推广、使用插秧机。早在4月中旬，全省就超额完成了今年三十万部插秧机的制造任务，并培训了插秧机手六十六多万人。因此，栽秧一开始，各地就把坚持使用插秧机，作为力争插秧高速度的重要武器。剑河县组织一百多个机插专业队，实行专人、专机、专用的办法，并组织干部、铁木工人、技术员和插秧机手共同深入田间表演，边用边改，使全县二千五百多部插秧机全部使用起来。据统计，全省先后使用起来的插秧机有二十多万部，平均工效比手插至少高一倍多。这就为加速插秧进度，节约劳动力，减轻体力劳动创造了极为有利的条件。农民歌唱插秧机说：“秧机插秧窝对窝，手扶秧机口唱歌，一阵歌声满田绿，越插心里越快活”。生动地表达了农民在解脱千百年来弯腰手插的痛苦后的愉快心情。此外，各地对目前暂不适用插秧机的少数稻田，或插秧机不够用的地方，及时组织手插，做到犁一丘、插一丘，不误插秧季节，加速总的插秧进度。
    为了适应大面积使用机插，各地采取了多种适合机插的劳动组织形式。安顺专区各县以人民公社、生产队为单位组织机插专业队，成立扯洗、装运、插补等专业队，以提高工效，减少辅助劳力。铜仁专区各地建立二千五百多个“一条龙”的专业插秧队，队下建立五人一组的插秧小组，分负扯、运、装、插、补等五道工序。（附图片）
