Everyone for Steel

    A Warm Feeling in My Heart
    Arriving at the workshop door, I suddenly smelled the aroma of food; strange: where did the food and soup come from in the workshop?! Ah! It turns out the leadership has set up a new canteen for us!
      ×　×　×
    Racing against time to make steel, but having to go to a very far place to eat; wasting time, affecting production! A canteen nearby, how wonderful.
      ×　×　×
    Today I don't have to leave the workshop to eat, just a few steps to the new canteen; the secretary serves the dishes, the director brings the soup, instantly a warm feeling in my heart; resolutely add another effort to win the great steel victory.

    心里暖洋洋
    来到车间房门旁，突然嗅到饭菜香；奇怪：车间那来的菜和汤？！啊！原来是领导给咱办起新食堂！
      ×　×　×
  　分秒必争为钢忙但是吃饭要到很远的地方；浪费时间，生产受影响！近处有个食堂多漂亮。
      ×　×　× 　 今天吃饭不出房，几步迈进新食堂；书记递菜，主任送汤，顿时心里暖洋洋；坚决再加一把劲，打好夺钢大胜仗。
