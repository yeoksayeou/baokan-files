With deep sorrow, we learned of the passing of Comrade Lin Boqu. All Party members in Shaanxi and the 18 million people of the province are in immense grief and offer our deepest condolences.

Comrade Boqu, a great revolutionary fighter of the Chinese people, was infinitely loyal to the Party and the people, and dedicated his life to the cause of communism. He made significant contributions in the history of the Chinese revolution. Comrade Boqu led the work of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region government for a long time, sharing weal and woe with the people of the Border Region and persisting in the struggle against the enemy until the final victory of the People's Liberation War. We remember this vividly and cherish his memory deeply. We will unite more closely around the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, learn from Comrade Boqu's revolutionary spirit of infinite loyalty to the cause of communism, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, strive to do our work well, and vow to struggle heroically to build China into a powerful socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture.

Eternal glory to Comrade Boqu!

The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
          The Shaanxi Provincial People's Committee

    中国人民的伟大革命战士——伯渠同志对党、对人民无限忠诚，为共产主义事业鞠躬尽瘁，在中国革命史上树立了重大功绩。伯渠同志曾经长时间领导陕甘宁边区政府工作，和边区人民同甘共苦，坚持对敌斗争，直到人民解放战争最后胜利。我们记忆犹新，怀念至深。我们一定更加紧密地团结在党中央和毛泽东同志的周围，学习伯渠同志对共产主义事业无限忠诚的革命精神，更高地举起毛泽东思想的红旗，努力作好工作，誓把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的强大的社会主义国家而英勇奋斗！
