    This newspaper reports: The Qingping People's Commune in Kaifeng City, Henan Province, through simple and crude methods and in the spirit of "poor wretches," has established a chemical craft factory, vigorously promoted technical innovation and revolution, solved key production problems, and gradually developed and consolidated the factory, creating excellent production results.
    The Qingping People's Commune Chemical Plant developed from a chemical group set up in February 1958 by three relief recipients from Qingping Street. At that time, they only had 200 yuan in relief funds as capital. People gathered in a half-room thatched house, using wooden stumps to crush sanitary balls and washbasins to boil vanishing cream. The daily output value was less than 20 yuan, and each person earned only six cents a day. This group persisted for more than half a year, reflecting the citizens' fervent desire to participate in production and vigorously develop industry. After the establishment of the Qingping Street People's Commune in August 1958, the commune's Party committee immediately expanded this chemical group into a chemical craft factory, equipped it with full-time cadres, strengthened Party leadership, and absorbed a group of street women to participate in production. Now, the factory has 100 employees, 42 factory buildings, four fixed-type workshops, and a set of equipment for manufacturing native sulfuric acid. The products include carbon paper, activated carbon, caustic soda, oleic acid, oil-soluble blue, oil-soluble violet, and 52 other products. These products are supplied to more than 30 local state-owned factories in Kaifeng City; high-quality oil-soluble blue, oil-soluble violet, etc., are also sold to Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, and other places. The factory has a high level of mechanization and automation, with a daily output value of 50,000 yuan, more than 2,000 times higher than the chemical group, and the labor productivity of employees has also increased by more than 100 times per month. More than 90% of the factory's employees are women. A year and a half ago, they were still housewives, but now they have all mastered two to five production technologies.
    The biggest feature of this factory is its use of simple and crude methods, self-reliance, overcoming various difficulties, and solving key problems that constantly arise in production. They have a technical group led by factory director Wu Xiuying (originally a housewife and a Communist Party member), which absorbs some activists, Communist Youth League members, carpenters, ironworkers, and a student to serve as the command center for the factory's technical innovation and technical revolution movement. In the early days of the factory's construction, 90% of the production processes were manual, and the workers' working hours were relatively long. The technical group mobilized everyone to find ways to buy old canvas belts, wood, scrap iron, etc., to make automatic wooden wheel machines and conveyor belts to reduce manual operations and carrying loads.
    The production of carbon paper, the factory's main product, further embodies the spirit of self-reliance and overcoming difficulties. They bought a hand-cranked carbon paper machine from a waste pile in a factory in Shanghai for 130 yuan. At first, four people used hand-cranked machines to make carbon paper, which was labor-intensive, had a high defect rate, and was inefficient. The technical group led everyone to study day and night, converting the machine to foot-pedal operation, and later to electric operation, and adding a drying oven and conveyor belt to the machine, making the production process fully automated. The output increased from 100 boxes to 2,000 boxes, the defect rate dropped from 10% to 1%, and the number of people per shift was reduced from four to one. When the supply of oil-soluble blue and oil-soluble violet, the main raw materials for carbon paper production, was insufficient, they sent people to Shanghai to copy the "formula" for manufacturing these two chemicals. Several raw materials in the "formula" were not available in Henan, so they boldly tried to use substitutes. After hundreds of failures, they finally succeeded in the experiment.
    The Qingping Commune Chemical Plant pays great attention to cooperation with large factories. In addition to learning technology in large factories, the employees enthusiastically participate in various production activities of large factories and are welcomed by the employees of large factories.
    Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, June 16th: The People's Communes in Nanguan District, Changchun City, have launched the "Five-Good" commune member campaign to lay an ideological foundation for consolidating and improving urban People's Communes.
    Nanguan District formed six urban People's Communes in mid-April this year, centered on street residents. Since the communization of the district, the urban working people, especially the vast number of employees' families, have been very enthusiastic and eager to run the urban People's Communes well. They actively participate in various production and service work of the communes and are eager to improve their political and ideological level. In order to strengthen the political and ideological work of commune members, deeply publicize the principle of running communes diligently and thriftily and the great significance of doing a good job in production for consolidating and developing urban communes, the Nanguan District Party Committee and the Party Committees of the People's Communes decided to launch a "Five-Good" commune member campaign in the vast number of commune members, namely, "Good in labor and work, good in ideological study, good in diligence and frugality, good in unity and mutual assistance, and good in sports and hygiene," to improve the ideological awareness of the vast number of commune members and ensure the continuous consolidation and development of the communes.
    Since the in-depth development of the "Five-Good" commune member campaign, the ideological awareness of the vast number of commune members has been greatly improved. The masses of commune members have universally established a style of putting the public first and the private second, prioritizing the country, then the commune, and finally themselves, and have more actively participated in various production and service work, which has powerfully promoted the development of production and other undertakings.

    清平公社化学工艺厂日益巩固
    长春南关区各人民公社开展“五好”社员运动
    本报讯　河南省开封市清平人民公社因陋就简，用“穷棒子”精神举办化学工艺厂，大闹技术革新和技术革命，解决了生产上的关键问题，使工厂逐步发展巩固，创造了优异的生产成绩。
    清平人民公社化工厂，是清平街三个救济户在1958年2月举办的一个化工小组发展起来的。那时他们只有两百元的救济金作为资金，人们聚在半间草屋里，用木墩砸卫生丸、洗脸盆熬雪花膏，日产值不到二十元，每人每天只有六分钱的收入。这个小组坚持半年多不散，反映了市民对参加生产、大搞工业的热烈要求。1958年8月清平街成立人民公社后，公社党委立即把这个化工小组扩大为化学工艺厂，配备了专职干部，加强了党的领导，吸收一批街道妇女参加生产。现在这个厂有一百名职工、四十二间厂房，有四个定型车间和一套制造土硫酸的设备，产品有复写纸、活性炭、苛性钠、油酸、油溶蓝、油溶紫等五十二种产品。这些产品供应了开封市三十多个地方国营工厂；优质油溶蓝、油溶紫等，还行销到上海、广州、杭州等地。全厂机械化和自动化水平很高，日产值达五万元，比化工小组时提高两千多倍，职工每月劳动生产率也提高了一百多倍。全厂职工90％以上是妇女。她们在一年半以前还是家庭妇女，现在都掌握了两种到五种生产技术。
    这个厂最大的特点是因陋就简，自力更生，克服种种困难，解决生产中不断出现的关键问题。她们有一个技术小组，由厂长吴秀英（原来是家庭妇女，共产党员）领导，吸收一些积极分子、共青团员、木工、铁工和一名学生参加，作为全厂开展技术革新和技术革命运动的指挥中心。建厂初期有90％的生产过程是手工操作，职工们的劳动时间比较长。技术小组就发动大家想办法，买了旧帆布带、木料、碎铁等，做成自动木轮机、传送带，减少手工操作和挑担现象。
    这个厂的主要产品复写纸的生产，更体现了自力更生克服困难的精神。她们在上海一家工厂的废料堆中，用一百三十元买来一架手摇制复写纸机，起初四个人用手摇制复写纸，劳动量大，次品率高，效率又低。技术小组就领导大家日夜钻研，把这架机器改成用脚蹬，后来又改成电动，并且在机器中增设了烘干炉和传送带，使生产过程全部自动化，产量由一百盒提高到两千盒，次品率由10％下降到1％，每班由原来四人减少到一人。生产复写纸的主要原料油溶蓝、油溶紫供应不足的时候，她们就派人到上海抄来了制造这两种化学品的“配方”；“配方”中有几种原料河南没有，她们又大胆试用代用品，经过了几百次失败，终于试验成功。
    清平公社化工厂很注意和大工厂协作，职工们到大工厂学习技术外，还热情地参予大工厂的各种生产活动，受到了大工厂职工的欢迎。
    据新华社长春16日电　长春市南关区各人民公社开展“五好”社员运动，为巩固和提高城市人民公社，打下思想基础。
    南关区今年4月中旬以街道居民为中心，组成了六个城市人民公社。全区公社化以来，城市劳动人民特别是广大职工家属热情很高，迫切要求把城市人民公社办好，他们积极地参加公社的各项生产和服务工作，并且迫切要求提高政治思想水平。为了加强对社员的政治思想工作，深入宣传勤俭办社的方针和搞好生产对巩固和发展城市公社的重大意义，中共南关区委和各人民公社党委决定在广大社员中深入开展一个“劳动工作好，思想学习好，勤俭节约好，团结互助好，体育卫生好”的“五好”社员运动，以提高广大社员的思想觉悟，保证公社不断巩固和发展。
    “五好”社员运动深入开展以后，大大提高了广大社员的思想觉悟，社员群众中普遍树立起了一为国、二为社、三为自己的先公后私的风格，更加积极地参加各种生产和服务工作，有力地促进了生产和其他事业的发展。
