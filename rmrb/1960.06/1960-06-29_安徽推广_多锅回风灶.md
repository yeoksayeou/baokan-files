Anhui Promotes "Multi-Pot Re-Circulating Stove"
Three major advantages of the multi-pot re-circulating stove: saves fuel, safe to use, simple structure

Our Hefei dispatch, June 28th. Taihe County, Anhui Province, has successfully created a "Multi-Pot Re-Circulating Stove." The characteristic of this stove is that the flue is long and extended through rotation, the air intake is large, and the fire is strong, enabling full utilization of the thermal energy of fuel combustion, thus saving firewood. According to tests, using the "Multi-Pot Re-Circulating Stove" in conjunction with pipe-led steamers, on average, each person only needs to burn half a catty of firewood for three meals a day, saving one and a half catties of fuel compared to using old-fashioned stoves. If this is widely promoted in rural public canteens throughout Anhui Province, tens of millions of catties of firewood can be saved per day. Because the flue of this stove is long and fully utilizes the residual heat of the flue, no sparks will fly out of the chimney, making it very safe to use.

The size of the "Multi-Pot Re-Circulating Stove" can be determined based on the number of pots, with four pots generally being suitable. The fire channels of the four pots are connected. Fire is lit under the first pot, and the flames can reach the bottom of the rear three pots. The waste smoke is folded back to the stove entrance through the flues built on both sides of the stove platform and then discharged through the chimney. One person can supervise three stoves (i.e., twelve pots), saving a lot of manpower compared to using old-fashioned stoves. The "Multi-Pot Re-Circulating Stove" has a simple structure and is easy to build, and each canteen can do it themselves. Its structure can be roughly divided into nine parts: chimney, stove door, ash removal door, firebox, water diversion platform, re-circulating flue, steam pot, gas transmission pipe, and steamer. The usage method is the same as with ordinary stoves.

This advanced stove was unanimously praised at the Anhui Province Processing and Cooking Utensils On-Site Conference, and was considered a meaningful innovation in cooking utensil reform. (Attached picture)

### 安徽推广“多锅回风灶”

    安徽推广“多锅回风灶”
    多锅回风灶的三大优点：节约燃料、使用安全、结构简单
    本报合肥二十八日电安徽省太和县创制成功一种“多锅回风灶”。这种锅灶的特点是烟道长，经过回转延长，吸风量大，火头旺，能够充分地利用燃料燃烧的热能，因而节省柴草。根据试验，用“多锅回风灶”配合管引式蒸笼使用，平均每人一天三餐饭菜只需烧半斤柴草，比使用旧式锅灶要节省燃料一斤半。安徽全省农村公共食堂如果普遍推广使用，一天即可以节省柴草几千万斤。这种锅灶因为烟道长，充分利用了烟道的余热，烟囱不会飞出火星，所以使用也很安全。
    “多锅回风灶”的大小可根据锅的多少而定，一般以四口锅为适宜。四口锅的火道相通，在第一口锅的底下烧火，火苗可窜到后面三口锅的底部，废烟经过砌在锅台两边的烟道折回到灶门口会合，再经烟囱排出。一个人可以看管三个灶（即十二口锅），比使用旧式锅灶要节省很多人力。“多锅回风灶”结构简单，建造方便，每个食堂都可以自己搞。它的构造大致可分烟囱、灶门、出灰门、灶膛、分水台、回风道、蒸汽锅、输气管、蒸汽笼等九个部分。使用方法与一般锅灶相同。
    这种先进的锅灶在安徽省加工、炊事工具现场会议上得到一致的好评，认为这是炊具改革中的一项有意义的创举。（附图片）
