Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 6th: News from Tokyo: Today, the Japanese "Defense Agency" dispatched 180 soldiers, suddenly landing on Niijima Island, 150 kilometers south of Tokyo Bay in the Pacific Ocean, in an attempt to forcibly build a missile launch site on the island.

This action by the Nobusuke Kishi government immediately met with resistance from the residents of Niijima, who have long insisted on fighting against the construction of a missile launch site. They sat on the beach to prevent the "Defense Agency's" troops from landing, and dug four large pits in the road leading to the planned missile launch site to prevent military vehicles from passing.

The Socialist Party's 18th extraordinary representative conference, which was in session, passed an emergency protest proposal after learning of the "Defense Agency's" dispatch of troops to land on Niijima.

The "Defense Agency" formulated a plan to build a missile launch site on Niijima two years ago and allocated 247 million yen from the national budget to build this military project. The Nobusuke Kishi government is preparing to test-fire the "Oerlikon" missiles it purchased from Switzerland on Niijima.

    日本新岛居民奋起斗争反对政府修建导弹基地
    新华社6日讯　东京消息：日本“防卫厅”今天派遣军队一百八十人突然在东京湾以南一百五十公里的太平洋上的新岛登陆，企图在岛上强制修建导弹发射场。
    岸信介政府的这一行动立即遭到了长期来坚持斗争反对修建导弹发射场的新岛居民的反抗，他们坐在沙滩上阻止“防卫厅”派来的军队登陆，并且在通往预定建筑导弹发射场的公路上挖了四个大坑，阻止军车通行。
    正在开会的社会党第十八次临时代表大会在得悉“防卫厅”派兵在新岛登陆的消息后，通过了紧急抗议的提案。
    “防卫厅”在两年以前就制订了在新岛修建导弹发射场的计划，并且从国家预算中拨出二亿四千七百万日元用来修建这项军事工程。岸信介政府准备在新岛试射它从瑞士购买来的“厄利康式”导弹。
