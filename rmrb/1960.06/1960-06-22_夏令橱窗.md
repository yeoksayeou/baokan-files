    Summer Showcase
    Skillfully Processing and Weaving Bamboo Curtains and Straw Hats
    The Beijing Native Produce Business Department recently transferred a batch of bamboo strips and straw hat braids from Fujian, Jiangxi, Shandong, Henan and other places, and is organizing factories and handicraft production cooperatives in the city to process and weave bamboo curtains and straw hats. The labor-style straw hats woven by Beijing, Temple of Heaven and other hat factories this year are light and convenient to wear, and also save materials. They also specially organized a batch of fine straw hat braids from the producing areas for Shengxifu Hat Shop to process various styles of fine straw hats. Now, a batch of bamboo curtains and straw hats have been processed.
    Colored Striped Towel Bed Sheets
    During the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the staff of the Baiyin City Knitting Factory in Gansu Province transformed towel machines into mechanical equipment for producing towel quilts. At present, they are mass-producing beautiful, summer-friendly, colored striped towel bed sheets.
    Actively Increase Production of Feather Fans
    The feather fans produced by the Wuhu City Plastics Factory in Anhui Province are characterized by their smallness, exquisiteness, beautiful style, and gentle breeze, making them most suitable for women and children. At present, the factory has sent more than 30 cadres to look for raw materials in other places, and plans to produce 280,000 feather fans this year, an increase of 80 percent over the actual output last year.
    Supply Summer Medicine in a Timely Manner
    In order to ensure the needs of the summer market, Wuhan Pharmaceutical Company has begun to put a large number of summer medicines on the market since late May. The first batch of medicines put on the urban and rural markets includes Rendan, Cooling Oil, Cooling Dan, and Ten Drops of Water.
    New Patterns for Small Flower Umbrellas
    The small flower umbrellas of Anqing, Anhui Province, which are beautiful in style, bright in color, transparent in umbrella surface, and inexpensive, are getting better and better in quality. The rain gear factory that produces small flower umbrellas has recently designed patterns such as roses and butterflies playing with flowers, and changed the original patterns such as wave crests and bamboo leaves into nested squares.
    In order to meet the needs of the people, this factory is doing everything possible to increase the production of small flower umbrellas, and strive to produce 20,000 umbrellas in the second quarter.
    Produce Baihua Medicated Soap in Season
    A medicated soap suitable for summer bathing - Baihua Medicated Soap - has been produced and marketed by the Chengdu Pacific Soap Factory.
    The Pacific Soap Factory has never produced medicated soap before. This year, in order to meet the needs of the masses for hygiene in the summer season, they started trial production. During the trial production, they encountered difficulties such as lack of red oil for coloring. After repeated research and experiments, they used indigenous methods to produce soap base plus sulfuric acid to make oleic acid, which solved the problems such as coloring the medicated soap. Baihua medicated soap is made of a variety of oils and medicinal materials, and is added with high-grade perfume, which has the efficacy of disinfecting and cleaning the skin. (with picture)
