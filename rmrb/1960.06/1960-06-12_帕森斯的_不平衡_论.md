Parson's Theory of "Imbalance"
Wu Si
    All the excuses for aggression by U.S. imperialism are full of contradictions, only exposing themselves and slapping their own faces. The "imbalance" theory of Parsons, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, is one such example.
    In his speech on February 19 and his recent testimony before a subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives, Parsons repeatedly stated that there is an "imbalance of power" between China and its surrounding countries, which makes the future of these countries "perilous." Because these countries are "weak," they need the "help" of the United States, which is "outside the region," to "survive" and "correct" this "imbalance." According to this excuse, the U.S. occupation of China's territory of Taiwan, the military occupation, semi-military occupation, or disguised military occupation of South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, and South Vietnam, and the conclusion of military treaties and establishment of military blocs with them, tying them to the U.S. chariot to oppose, encircle, and prepare to attack China, all this cannot be called aggression and expansion, but is for "helping these countries' hard-won independence," for "security," and for "peace"!
    However, if Parsons' excuse holds true, then there is no region or group of countries in the world today where there is no "imbalance of power." Should all the stronger countries then be militarily surrounded and prepared for armed attack by countries "outside the region"? The "imbalance of power" between the United States and Latin American countries should be large enough. Should countries outside the American continent occupy Hawaii or Alaska, carry out military occupation and control of the countries surrounding the United States, and oppose, encircle, and prepare to attack the United States? Wouldn't that be entirely in line with Parsons' gangster logic?
    Due to the imbalance in the development of power, wars arise, "survival of the fittest" is practiced, victorious countries enslave defeated countries, large countries bully small countries, and strong countries oppress weak countries. This is precisely a universal law in the capitalist world. After the end of World War II, the United States took advantage of the weakening of the old colonialist countries of Britain and France to expand its influence in the capitalist world. For example, after the war, the United States took advantage of the economic difficulties of Western European countries to propose the "Marshall Plan," seizing the opportunity to make a big profit. After the end of the Indochina War, the United States replaced France's colonial rule in South Vietnam. After the Suez War, the United States proposed the "Eisenhower Doctrine" for the Middle East to "fill the vacuum." The United States uses "aid," private investment, and commodity dumping to squeeze out the traditional markets of countries such as Britain and France, and plunder economically underdeveloped countries. Recently, under the guise of "progress in freedom," the United States has been trying its best to infiltrate the Asian and African regions and seize vast intermediate zones... Aren't all these most greedy aggressions and expansions carried out according to the law of the imbalance of power?
    Now Parsons is clamoring about the "expansionist threat" to neighboring countries caused by the strong development of New China. This is completely a trick of a thief crying "stop thief" and is completely to cover up its aggressive and expansionist activities in the Western Pacific region. New China has not and will never send a single soldier to occupy the territory of others, has not and will never establish military bases abroad, and does not need to and will not compete for markets abroad. Parsons cannot give such an example and can only carry out slanderous anti-China propaganda. However, Parsons cited some "facts" as proof of China's so-called "threat." What are these "facts"?
    One is that China "dresses itself up as a friend of nationalism" and "an enemy of colonialism and imperialism," he said, which "intensifies the threat." That's right, New China is a friend of all oppressed nations and friends of nationally independent countries, but it is an enemy of colonialism and imperialism. This is not "dressing up." The Chinese people have always fully supported the national democratic movements of various countries. Recently, tens of millions of people across the country held demonstrations to support the struggles of the people of South Korea, Turkey, and Japan against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. New China has been striving for and promoting friendly cooperation with nationally independent countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The Chinese people and the people of Asian countries have always supported each other in their struggles and are willing to cooperate after independence. How can this be said to be a "threat"?
    The second "fact" is that Chinese radio stations "repeatedly demand that we (U.S. imperialism) leave the Western Pacific." This is also correct. Not only the Chinese people, but all the people of Asia are shouting loudly: "U.S. imperialism, get back home." U.S. imperialism has come to the Western Pacific from more than 10,000 kilometers away to run rampant, infringing upon the independence and sovereignty of Asian countries, and endangering Asian peace. This has aroused the anger of the people of the entire Asia, and has sparked storms of struggle by the people of South Korea and Japan against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. It is absolutely impossible for U.S. imperialism not to get out of the Western Pacific. If U.S. imperialism gets out of the Western Pacific, the Asian people will have peace, independence, and the guarantee of independent development. How can this be a "threat" to the Asian people?
    Another "fact" is that China is "obsessed with unrealistic" and "rude and aggressive attitude" toward U.S. imperialism, and the United States cannot "hope" that this policy of New China will have the "necessary changes." If this means that New China firmly opposes U.S. imperialism's occupation of China's territory of Taiwan, firmly opposes the U.S. policy of aggression and war, and will never have any unrealistic illusions about it, and that this policy of New China will not change, that is also correct. It is not China, but U.S. imperialism that is rude and unreasonable, and not only aggressive, but simply trying to put people to death. The Chinese people and the awakened people of Asia are determined to fight against it until they defeat it and drive it out of the Western Pacific. This is not "obsessed with unrealistic things," but is absolutely realistic. U.S. imperialism stubbornly wants to stay in the Western Pacific. Eisenhower is still stubbornly "visiting" the Far East, supporting the dying puppet regime, and suppressing the anti-American storm of the Asian people. This is really "obsessed with unrealistic things" and is bound to be disillusioned. As for Parsons saying that China wants to "use force or threaten with force," this is a bankrupt slander. It is China that has consistently suggested resolving disputes between the two countries with the United States without the use of force or threats of force. To this end, China has adopted a patient attitude and held ninety-eight ambassadorial-level talks with the United States. However, China's proposal has always been rejected by the United States, preventing the ambassadorial-level talks from reaching an agreement. At the same time, the United States has repeatedly carried out military provocations and threats of war in the Taiwan Strait, infringing upon China's territorial waters and airspace more than one hundred and sixty times. Parsons still states that this policy of U.S. imperialism cannot be changed. Yes, U.S. imperialism will never change its policy of aggression. Didn't Lodge clamor on June 8 that "military power is an indispensable and concrete support for our (American) foreign policy"?
    From this, it can be clearly seen that the "threat" of New China, which Parsons and his ilk are clamoring about, is precisely because the resolute struggle of the Chinese people and the united struggle of the Chinese people and the Asian people have made U.S. imperialism's aggressive and expansionist activities in the Western Pacific encounter increasing difficulties and have been repeatedly frustrated, falling into a situation of being besieged on all sides. It is conceivable that as New China becomes stronger and the struggles of the Asian people progress, Parsons and his ilk will shout about "threats" for a while and talk about "imbalances" for a while. However, all his slanders, past, present, and future, will not harm a single hair of New China, but will only further expose the extremely greedy aggressive ambitions of U.S. imperialism.

     帕森斯的“不平衡”论
    武斯
    美帝国主义的一切侵略借口，都是矛盾百出，只能暴露自己，把自己的巴掌打到自己的脸上。美国负责远东事务的助理国务卿帕森斯的“不平衡”论，就是一个例子。
    帕森斯在2月19日发表的演说和最近在美国众议院小组委员会的证词中，一再说什么中国同周围的国家之间“存在着力量的不平衡”，使得这些国的前途“岌岌可危”；而由于这些国家是“虚弱”的，所以，就需要由“这个地区以外”的美国来“帮助”它们“生存下去”，“纠正”这个“不平衡”。根据这样的借口，美国侵占中国领土台湾，对南朝鲜、日本、菲律宾和南越实行军事占领、半军事占领或变相的军事占领，并同它们缔结军事条约和建立军事集团，把它们绑在美国战车上，来敌视、包围和准备进攻中国，这一切都不能叫做侵略和扩张，而是为了“帮助这些国家的得来不易的独立”，为了“安全”，为了“和平”！
    但是，如果帕森斯这个借口能够成立，那末，在今天的地球上，没有一个地区或几个国家之间不存在“力量的不平衡”。这样，是不是都应该由“地区以外”的国家，来对其中较强的国家实行军事包围并准备武装进攻呢？美国同拉丁美洲国家之间的“力量的不平衡”，应该是够大的了，是不是也应该由美洲大陆以外的国家，来占领美国的夏威夷或阿拉斯加，对美国的周围国家实行军事占领和控制，来敌视、包围和准备进攻美国呢？再拿所谓“自由世界”来说，美国是“自由世界”中最强大的国家，它们之间的力量最不平衡，是不是应该由“自由世界”以外的国家来占领美国的领土，或对所谓“自由世界”中的其他国家实行军事占领和控制来“纠正”美国呢？这样说，不才是十分符合帕森斯的强盗逻辑吗？
    由于力量发展的不平衡，产生战争，实行“弱肉强食”，战胜国奴役战败国，大国欺凌小国，强国压迫弱国，这恰恰是资本主义世界中的一条普遍规律。在第二次世界大战结束后，美国利用英法老殖民主义国家削弱的情况，在资本主义世界大肆扩张自己的势力。例如，美国在战后，利用西欧国家的经济困难，提出了“马歇尔计划”，乘机大捞一把；印度支那战争结束后，美国取代了法国在南越的殖民统治；苏伊士战争结束后，美国对中东提出了“艾森豪威尔主义”以“填补真空”；美国以“援助”、私人投资和商品倾销的方式，排挤英法等国家的传统市场，掠夺经济不发达国家；最近美国在“取得自由中的进展”的幌子下，竭力向亚非地区渗透，夺取广大中间地带……所有这一切最贪婪的侵略和扩张，不正是根据力量的不平衡的规律而进行的吗？
    现在帕森斯大叫大嚷什么新中国的强大发展造成对邻国的“扩张侵略威胁”之类的鬼话，完全是贼喊捉贼的把戏，完全是为了掩盖它在西太平洋地区的侵略扩张活动。新中国没有也决不会派一兵一卒去侵占别人的领土，没有也决不会在国外设立军事基地，没有也不需要向国外争夺市场。帕森斯举不出这样的一个例子来，而只能进行煽动反华的诬蔑宣传。但是，帕森斯举出了一些“事实”，来作为所谓中国的“威胁”的证明。是些什么“事实”呢？
    一个是中国“把自己装扮成民族主义的朋友”和“殖民主义和帝国主义的敌人”，他说，这就使“威胁加剧”了。一点不错，新中国是一切被压迫民族的朋友，民族独立国家的朋友，却是殖民主义和帝国主义的敌人。这不是什么“装扮”。中国人民始终全力支持各国民族民主运动，最近全国几千万人民举行示威游行支持南朝鲜、土耳其和日本人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争；新中国一直争取和促进同民族独立国家在和平共处五项原则基础上的友好合作。中国和亚洲各国人民一直是在自己的斗争中互相支持，并愿意在独立后进行合作，这怎么能说是什么“威胁”呢？
    第二个“事实”是：中国电台“一再要求我们（美帝国主义）离开西太平洋”。这也一点不错。不仅是中国人民，而且全亚洲人民都在这样大声疾呼：“美帝国主义滚回老家去。”美帝国主义从一万多公里以外跑到西太平洋来横行霸道，侵犯亚洲各国的独立主权，危害亚洲和平，已经引起了全亚洲人民的愤怒，激起了南朝鲜人民、日本人民的反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争风暴。美帝国主义不滚出西太平洋是绝对不行的。美帝国主义滚出了西太平洋，亚洲人民就有了和平，独立和独立发展就有了保障，这怎么倒是对亚洲人民的“威胁”了呢？
    再一个“事实”是，说中国“醉心于脱离实际”的对美帝国主义的“蛮横的咄咄逼人的态度”，美国不能“希望”新中国的这种政策会有“必要的改变”。如果这是说新中国坚决反对美帝国主义霸占中国领土台湾，坚决反对美国的侵略政策和战争政策，决不会对它有任何不切实际的幻想，新中国这个政策不会改变，这也一点不错。不是中国，而是美帝国主义蛮横无理、并且不仅是咄咄逼人，简直是要置人于死地。中国人民和亚洲觉悟了的人民坚决同它斗争，直到把它打败，把它赶出西太平洋，这不是“醉心于脱离实际”，而是绝对现实的。美帝国主义死要赖在西太平洋，艾森豪威尔还硬着头皮“访问”远东，扶植奄奄一息的傀儡政权，镇压亚洲人民的反美风暴，这才真是“醉心于脱离实际”，是一定要幻灭的。至于帕森斯说什么中国要“使用武力、以武力相威胁”，这是早已破了产的诬蔑。正是中国，一直建议同美国不以武力和武力威胁来解决两国争端。为了这个目的，中国采取了耐心的态度，同美国举行了九十八次大使级会谈。但中国的这种建议，始终遭到美国拒绝，使大使级会谈未能取得协议。与此同时，美国一再在台湾海峡进行军事挑衅和战争威胁，侵犯中国领海领空已达一百六十多次。帕森斯一直到现在还申明，美帝国主义的这种政策，决不能改变。是的，美帝国主义是永远也不会改变它的侵略政策的。洛奇不是就在6月8日叫嚷“军事力量是我们（美国）的外交政策的必不可少的具体支持”吗？
    从这里可以清楚地看到，帕森斯之流叫嚷的新中国的“威胁”，正是因为中国人民的坚决斗争，中国人民同亚洲人民的联合斗争，使美帝国主义在西太平洋的侵略扩张活动碰到了越来越大的困难，并一再遭到了挫败，陷于四面楚歌之中。可以想见，随着新中国强大一步，亚洲人民的斗争进展一步，帕森斯之流就要大叫一阵“威胁”，就要大谈一阵“不平衡”。但是，他的一切诬蔑，过去、现在和将来都无损于新中国的一根毫毛，而只能越益暴露美帝国主义无比贪婪的侵略野心而已。
