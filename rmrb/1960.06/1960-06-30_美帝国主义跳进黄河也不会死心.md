U.S. Imperialism Won't Give Up Even If It Jumps Into the Yellow River
By our commentator

U.S. imperialism will not learn its lesson; it will not go against the law of making trouble, failing, making trouble again, failing again, until its demise. Eisenhower's radio address on June 27, after ending his shameful trip to the Far East and returning to the United States, irrefutably proves this point.

Eisenhower's recent "visit" to the Far East was a publicly known, shameful failure. The people of Asia taught the head of U.S. imperialism a hard lesson. Even in Okinawa, which is under direct U.S. control, this plague was angrily chased away by hundreds of thousands of demonstrators. Eisenhower's disgrace caused even the U.S. bourgeois newspapers to lament that the United States had suffered a "major diplomatic failure" and "lost considerable face in the East." Some U.S. congressmen have once again stirred up a clamor to re-evaluate U.S. policy toward the Far East. However, Eisenhower has a different assessment of his own trip, shamelessly boasting about the success of his Far East trip, claiming that the people of Asia conveyed "messages" of "how friendly, grateful, and respectful" they were to the U.S. imperialism he represents. He clearly received a heavy slap in the face from the Japanese people, yet he claimed that "the vast majority of people there were eager to welcome me as the representative of a nation with whom they hoped to cooperate and establish friendly relations." The U.S. president's "spiritual victory" philosophy is truly inferior even to Ah Q. Eisenhower's clumsy self-consolation can only elicit more ridicule from the people of all countries.

It is particularly shameless that Eisenhower actually described the so-called "ratification" of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, which the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries had painstakingly concocted, as a "significant victory for the free world." We don't need to talk further about the aggressive nature of this treaty and how it endangers Asian peace, nor about how strongly the Japanese and Asian people oppose this aggressive treaty (were the more than tens of millions of Japanese people launching nineteen unified actions to express support for this treaty?). Just looking at how ugly the so-called "ratification" of this treaty by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries was, one can know what kind of "victory" Eisenhower is boasting about. In order to get this treaty "passed" by the Japanese parliament, the Kishi Nobusuke clique staged shameless farces again and again, first fighting in the House of Representatives, then "passing" it in the House of Councillors without a "vote," and finally, Kishi Nobusuke had no choice but to announce his resignation due to his utter disgrace. Eisenhower is no more glorious in this regard than his lackey. In order to hurriedly impose this treaty on the Japanese people, Eisenhower disregarded legal procedures and hastily signed the ratification in Hawaii before the U.S. Senate discussed it. The exchange of "ratification instruments" could only be carried out secretly. There have been many reactionary governments in history that have signed many shameful aggressive and traitorous treaties, but the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries' manufacturing of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty is one of the most despicable and ugly.

Eisenhower's great boasting that the "ratification" of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty is a U.S. "victory" is not only self-satire but also an open challenge to the Japanese and Asian people. As everyone knows, although the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries have declared the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty "established," the Japanese people have not approved this treaty and never will. The Japanese people are continuing to launch more tenacious struggles to smash the U.S.-Japan military alliance. Eisenhower now not only openly slander the Japanese people who are carrying out patriotic and just struggles as "a few violent and disorderly people," but also shows that the United States insists on forcibly implementing the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty that the Japanese people do not recognize, attempting to permanently place the Japanese people under its enslavement and push them into the abyss of aggressive war. At the same time, people cannot help but see Eisenhower's clamor about the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty as a signal that the United States is accelerating its plan to promote aggressive war in the Far East, using the revival of Japanese militarism as a lever. Eisenhower has once again exposed that U.S. imperialism is not only the deadly enemy of the Japanese people but also the deadly enemy of the people of all Asian countries.

Eisenhower especially clearly stated that the United States will never change its policy of hostility toward the Chinese people. He not only once again launched vicious attacks on our country but also advocated "linking other countries in the Far East more forcefully with the United States" to deal with our country. According to Eisenhower, the way to strengthen this "link" is to establish military blocs like the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, to maintain U.S. occupation in many places in the Far East, and to provide so-called "aid" to some countries. He particularly emphasized that the Japanese militarist forces that are rising again "can strengthen this effort by the United States." It is very clear that the United States is trying to maintain and strengthen its Far East aggressive war system with Japan as its core. The spearhead of this aggressive war system is primarily aimed at the Chinese people. It is equally clear that, feeling that its aggressive front in the Far East has been shaken, the United States is trying to once again trot out the fabricated "Communist China threat" to intimidate other Asian countries in order to strengthen U.S. control over these countries and stabilize its position in the Far East. Eisenhower openly shouted that the countries of the Far East "can only survive in freedom and prosperity if they establish cooperative ties with the United States and a free Japan." Eisenhower's clamor can only remind the Asian people of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" and "New Order in East Asia" that Japanese militarists once promoted. U.S. imperialism insists on taking the old path of Japanese imperialism and is using the Japanese militarists it has cultivated as an experienced guide, which cannot but arouse the high vigilance of the Asian people.

Although even U.S. bourgeois journalists believe that Eisenhower's "peace" cloak has been completely stripped off during his recent trip, like the ignorant king in Andersen's fairy tale, Eisenhower, naked, still believes that he is wearing dazzling clothes. In his speech, he tirelessly peddled words like "peace of freedom and justice," trying to make people believe that he and the U.S. imperialism he represents are pursuing a "peace" policy. However, even in this speech, Eisenhower could not hide his warlike nature and aggressive ambitions. He shouted that "the first thing is to keep our own defenses strong, modern, and prepared," and that when taking action against socialist countries "for the sake of ourselves and the free world," we must not be "timid, passive, or mistaken," and we must be willing to risk "taking bold action." Linking Eisenhower's words with the clamor in the United States for launching a "preemptive" war against socialist countries, it is not difficult for people to see that U.S. imperialism is stepping up preparations for war against the socialist camp. Therefore, we must never think that the forces defending peace are unprecedentedly strong and underestimate the adventurousness and madness of U.S. imperialism.

There is a Chinese saying that stubborn people "won't give up until they reach the Yellow River," but U.S. imperialism won't give up even if it jumps into the Yellow River. The recent development of the situation in Asia fully demonstrates that U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression and war in the Far East has been opposed by the people of Asia and has declared bankruptcy. Today's Asia is no longer the world of U.S. imperialism. Eisenhower even personally witnessed this irreversible situation during his "experimental trip." But U.S. imperialism does not retreat in the face of difficulties. After experiencing the storm in Asia, Eisenhower, with his soul barely calmed, openly stated that the United States will never change its policy of aggression and war against Asia. Facing this arrogant challenge from U.S. imperialism, what should the Asian people do? Only by strengthening the struggle against U.S. imperialism, strengthening unity in the struggle, and continuing to give its aggressive and war policies a heavier blow. No matter how ferocious U.S. imperialism is, final victory will surely belong to the Asian people, and U.S. imperialism will eventually be driven out of Asia and the West Pacific.

    美帝国主义跳进黄河也不会死心
    本报评论员
    美帝国主义是不会接受教训的，它不会违背捣乱、失败、再捣乱、再失败，直至死亡这样一个规律。艾森豪威尔结束了他可耻的远东之行回到美国之后在6月27日发表的广播演说，无可辩驳地证明了这一点。
    艾森豪威尔最近到远东来进行的“访问”，遭到了可耻的失败，这是人所共见的。亚洲人民狠狠地教训了这个美帝国主义的头子一顿。就在美国直接控制下的冲绳，这位瘟神也遭到十万示威群众的怒逐。艾森豪威尔的出丑，使得美国的资产阶级报纸也哀呼美国遭到了“外交上的大失败”，“在东方大大丢了面子”；一些美国的议员也再一次掀起重新估计美国对远东的政策的吵嚷。但是艾森豪威尔对他自己的这次旅行却另有评价，他恬不知耻地吹嘘他的远东之行的成功，说什么亚洲人民向他所代表的美帝国主义传达了“多么友好、感激和尊敬”的“信息”。明明是挨了日本人民一下重重的耳光，他还说什么“那里的绝大多数的人迫切希望把我当作他们希望和它合作并建立友好关系的国家的代表来欢迎”。美国总统的“精神胜利”哲学，真是使阿Q也为之逊色。艾森豪威尔的这种拙劣透顶的自我解嘲，只能引起各国人民更多的耻笑罢了。
    特别不知羞耻的是，艾森豪威尔居然把美日反动派费了九牛二虎之力才泡制出来的日美军事同盟条约的所谓“批准”，说成是什么“自由世界的一个重要的胜利”。我们用不着再去多谈这个条约如何危害亚洲和平的侵略性质，也不去多谈这个侵略性条约受到日本人民和亚洲各国人民如何强烈的反对，（几千万以上的日本人民展开十九次统一行动难道是为了表示支持这个条约的吗？）只要看一看美日反动派对这个条约的所谓“批准”是何等的丑不堪言，就可以知道艾森豪威尔所吹嘘的所谓“胜利”是什么样的一种“胜利”。岸信介集团为了使这个条约获得日本议会“通过”，一而再演出了无耻的丑剧，先是在众议院大打出手，继而在参议院不“通”而“过”，最后岸信介甚至不能不由于身败名裂而宣告下台。艾森豪威尔在这方面也不比他的奴才光彩多少。为了匆匆地把这个条约强加在日本人民头上，艾森豪威尔竟不顾法律程序，在美国参议院讨论之前就急忙在夏威夷在批准书上签了字。双方交换“批准书”也只能偷偷摸摸地进行。历史上有过不少反动政府签订过许多见不得人的侵略条约和卖国条约，但是像美日反动派制造日美军事同盟条约所表现的这样卑鄙丑恶的，实在还不多见。
    艾森豪威尔大事吹嘘日美军事同盟条约的“批准”是美国的“胜利”，这不仅是一种自我讽刺，同时也是对日本人民和亚洲人民的一种公然挑战。大家知道，尽管美日反动派自封日美军事同盟条约“成立”，日本人民并没有批准这个条约，而且永远也不会批准这个条约。日本人民正在继续展开更顽强的斗争来粉碎日美军事同盟。艾森豪威尔现在不但公开诋毁进行爱国正义斗争的日本人民是“少数狂暴的不守秩序的人”，而且表明美国硬要强行实施日本人民所不承认的日美军事同盟条约，企图永久把日本人民置于它的奴役之下，并把他们推向侵略战争的深渊。同时人们也不能不把艾森豪威尔关于日美军事同盟条约的叫嚷，看作是美国加紧在远东推行其以复活日本军国主义为杠杆的侵略战争计划的一个信号。艾森豪威尔这就再一次暴露了，美帝国主义不仅是日本人民的死敌，而且是亚洲各国人民的死敌。
    艾森豪威尔尤其明显地表明，美国决不改变它敌视中国人民的政策。他不但对我国又一次进行恶毒的攻击，而且鼓吹要“把远东的其他国家同美国更有力地联结起来”对付我国。而加强这种“联结”的方式，据艾森豪威尔说，就是建立像东南亚条约组织那样的军事集团，就是维持美国在远东许多地方的占领，就是美国对一些国家的所谓“援助”。他特别强调正在东山再起的日本军国主义势力“能够加强美国的这种努力”。这就十分明显，美国力图维持和加强它的以日本为核心的远东侵略战争体系。这个侵略战争体系的矛头首先是指向中国人民。同样十分明显的，由于感到自己在远东的侵略阵线已经发生动摇，美国企图再搬出无中生有的所谓“共产党中国威胁”的谰言来对其他亚洲国家进行恫吓，以便借此加强美国对这些国家的控制，稳住它在远东的阵脚。艾森豪威尔公然叫喊：远东的国家“只有在同美国和一个自由的日本建立合作的联系的情况下才能在自由和繁荣中生存下去”。艾森豪威尔的这种叫嚷，只能使亚洲人民想起日本军国主义者过去曾经宣扬的“大东亚共荣圈”和“东亚新秩序”。美帝国主义硬要走日本帝国主义的老路，而且把它一手扶植起来的日本军国主义者作为识途的老马，这不能不引起亚洲人民的高度警惕。
    尽管连美国的资产阶级记者也认为艾森豪威尔的“和平”外衣在最近一次旅行中已被剥落净尽了，但是就像安徒生童话中那个愚昧的国王一样，艾森豪威尔光着身子还认为自己仍然穿着使人炫目的外衣。他在演说中依旧不厌其烦地卖弄“自由和正义的和平”一类的词句，企图要人相信他和他所代表的美帝国主义是执行什么“和平”政策。但是艾森豪威尔就在这一次演说中也隐藏不住自己好战的本性和侵略的野心。他大叫“首要的事情是使我们自己的防务保持强大、现代化和戒备”，“为了我们自己和自由世界的利益”而对社会主义国家采取行动时，不能“胆怯、消极或认错”，必须甘冒“采取大胆行动的风险”。把艾森豪威尔的这些话同美国国内正在甚嚣尘上的鼓吹向社会主义国家发动“先发制人”战争的叫嚣联系起来，人们就不难看出美帝国主义是在加紧准备对社会主义阵营的战争。因此，我们绝对不能以为保卫和平的力量已空前强大就可以低估美帝国主义的冒险性和疯狂性。
    中国有句俗话说，冥顽不灵的人是“不到黄河心不死”的，而美帝国主义却是即使跳进黄河也不会死心。亚洲最近局势的发展，充分表明了美帝国主义在远东的侵略和战争政策已遭到了亚洲人民的群起反对而宣告破产，今日之亚洲已非美帝国主义的天下。艾森豪威尔并且在他的“试验性旅行”中亲眼看到了这种无可挽回的局势。但是美帝国主义并不知难而退。艾森豪威尔在经历了亚洲的风暴以后，惊魂甫定，就公开表示：美国决不改变它对亚洲的侵略和战争政策。面对着美帝国主义这种狂妄的挑战，亚洲人民应当怎么样呢？只有加强反对美帝国主义的斗争，加强在斗争中的团结，继续给予它的侵略和战争政策以更沉重的打击。不管美帝国主义怎样凶恶，最后胜利一定属于亚洲人民，美帝国主义终将要被赶出亚洲和西太平洋去。
