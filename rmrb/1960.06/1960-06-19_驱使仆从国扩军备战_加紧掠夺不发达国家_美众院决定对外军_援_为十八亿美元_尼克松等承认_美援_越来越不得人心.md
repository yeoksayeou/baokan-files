Xinhua News Agency, June 18th: Washington dispatch: The U.S. House of Representatives yesterday rejected its Appropriations Committee's recommendation to cut foreign military "aid" by $400 million, and instead decided to allocate $1.8 billion in direct foreign military "aid," down from the $2 billion originally requested by Eisenhower.

In recent days, the U.S. House of Representatives and its Appropriations Committee, as well as the Senate Appropriations Committee, have been discussing the U.S. foreign "aid" appropriations for the next fiscal year. Some leading figures of the U.S. ruling group took the opportunity to tout the so-called foreign "aid," which serves as a tool of U.S. aggression policy, on various occasions.

Acting Secretary of State Dillon made a "forceful" statement on the 15th, demanding that the U.S. Congress allocate a huge sum of $4.175 billion in accordance with Eisenhower's proposed "Mutual Security Program" to promote the expansion of armaments and war preparations by U.S. vassal states. He criticized the House Appropriations Committee's proposal to cut foreign military "aid" appropriations by $400 million and so-called "defense support" funds by $120 million, saying that this would "weaken our (U.S.) forward defenses" and "endanger our national security." Dillon emphasized the "urgent need" to strengthen U.S. control over its "allies" and "newly developing countries" through "aid."

U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs Lewis Jones spared no effort to defend the U.S. government's "foreign aid" plan, which aims to plunder and control other countries, before the Senate Appropriations Committee on the 16th. He said that this plan "is important to the security of the United States and the free world." He specifically requested Congress to approve the $803 million appropriation for the Near East and South Asia regions for the next fiscal year. Of this appropriation, military "aid" accounts for $458 million, an increase of $203 million over the military "aid" appropriation for the previous fiscal year.

Jones also particularly touted the World Bank's plan for utilizing the Indus River, which is controlled by the U.S. He said that the World Bank "is hopeful that India and Pakistan can reach agreement on all important issues (related to this plan) within two months." Jones added: "For the sake of U.S. interests, it is necessary to continue to support our staunch ally—Pakistan" and "strengthen its economic and military strength."

However, in the face of the rising tide of anti-Americanism in countries receiving large amounts of "U.S. aid," U.S. rulers cannot but admit that U.S. so-called "aid" has become increasingly unpopular. U.S. House Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Passman Otto said on the 16th that the U.S. has spent a total of $100 billion on foreign "aid" of various kinds since the end of World War II, but "it is very clear that our foreign aid has not achieved the purpose it was intended to achieve. We cannot buy friends."

U.S. Vice President Nixon also said on the 14th that the U.S. "foreign aid" plan "has had little effect in ensuring that we (referring to the United States) gain the goodwill and loyalty of foreign peoples, and in cultivating the kind of attitude necessary to resist the efforts of the Communists to take over the world." However, he still emphasized that the U.S. must strengthen its deceptive propaganda "to convince underdeveloped countries" that the assistance the United States gives them is not only "to preserve ourselves, but because we care about their own welfare."

### 驱使仆从国扩军备战　加紧掠夺不发达国家  美众院决定对外军“援”为十八亿美元  尼克松等承认“美援”越来越不得人心

    驱使仆从国扩军备战　加紧掠夺不发达国家
    美众院决定对外军“援”为十八亿美元
    尼克松等承认“美援”越来越不得人心
    新华社18日讯　华盛顿消息：美国众议院昨天否决了它的拨款委员会关于削减对外军事“援助”四亿美元的建议，而决定把直接对外军事“援助”拨款从艾森豪威尔原来所要求的二十亿美元改为十八亿美元。
    最近几天，美国众议院和它的拨款委员会以及参议院拨款委员会对美国下一财政年度的对外“援助”拨款展开了讨论。美国统治集团的一些头面人物乘机在各种场合为作为美国侵略政策的工具的所谓对外“援助”大肆鼓吹。
    代理国务卿狄龙15日发表“措辞强硬”的谈话，要求美国国会按照艾森豪威尔提出的“共同安全计划”，拨出四十一亿七千五百万美元的巨款来推动美国的仆从国扩军备战。他指责众议院拨款委员会主张削减对外军事“援助”拨款四亿美元和所谓“防务支持”费用一亿二千万美元的建议，说这将“削弱我们（美国）前线的防御”，“危及我国的安全”。狄龙强调有“迫切的需要”通过“援助”来加强美国对其“盟国”和“新近发展的国家”的控制。
    美国负责近东、南亚事务助理国务卿刘易斯·琼斯16日在参议院拨款委员会竭力为美国政府的以掠夺和控制别国为目的的“援外”计划辩护。他说，这个计划“对美国和自由世界的安全是重要的”。他特别要求国会批准下一财政年度给近东和南亚地区的八亿三百万美元的拨款。在这笔拨款中军事“援助”占四亿五千八百万美元，比上一财政年度的军事“援助”拨款增加了二亿零三百万美元。
    琼斯还特别鼓吹美国所控制的世界银行关于利用印度河的计划。他说，世界银行“对于在两个月内印度和巴基斯坦有可能在（有关这个计划的）所有重要的问题上取得一致这一点，抱有希望。”琼斯又说：“为了美国的利益，必须继续支持我们的坚定的盟友——巴基斯坦”，并“加强它的经济与军事实力。”
    但是，在接受大量“美援”的国家中反美浪潮日益高涨的情况下，美国统治者也不能不承认美国的所谓“援助”已经越来越不得人心。美国众议院国外活动拨款小组委员会主席帕斯曼·奥托16日说，美国从第二次世界大战结束以来在各种名目的对外“援助”上共花了一千亿美元，但是，“十分明显，我们的对外援助并没有达到它所要达到的目的。我们不能买到朋友。”
    美国副总统尼克松14日也说，美国的“援外”计划“在保证我们（指美国）获得外国人民的好感和忠诚方面，在培养为抵制共产党人接管世界的努力所必须的那种态度方面，几乎没有什么效果”。可是，他仍强调美国必须加强它的欺骗宣传“使不发达国家相信”，美国给予他们的援助不只是“为了保全我们自己，而且因为我们关心它们自己的福利。”
