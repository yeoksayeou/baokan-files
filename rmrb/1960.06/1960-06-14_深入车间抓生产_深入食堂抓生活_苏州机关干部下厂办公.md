    Going Deep into Workshops to Grasp Production, Going Deep into Dining Halls to Grasp Livelihood:
    Suzhou Cadres Go to Factories to Work

    (From Our Own Correspondent) Leading cadres from the city and district level organs in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, have recently gone down to factories and enterprises to work, establishing on-site command posts on the production front lines, participating in production and leading production, promoting a steady rise in production. Pig iron production in late May increased by 31% compared to the first and middle ten days of the month, and the first five days of June increased by another 18% compared to late May.

    With the exception of essential cadres, the city and district level organs in Suzhou moved to the grassroots level to work in mid-May. The industrial, transportation, and basic construction departments went deep into their affiliated grassroots units, dividing areas and designating points, using points to lead the whole area. Party and mass organizations, and political and legal departments, also went deep into advanced or backward units in the industrial system, establishing base points and carrying out their own work around industrial production. Comrade Jiao Kangshou, First Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, and other secretaries of the Secretariat took the lead by moving their bedding to key steel plants or basic construction sites, going deep into furnace fronts or construction sites, participating in labor, and leading production. Under the leadership of the responsible comrades of the Municipal Party Committee, a total of more than 2,000 cadres went down to the grassroots level to work, accounting for 80% of the entire cadre force of the city and district organs. The vast majority of comrades have achieved the goal of eating, living, and working alongside the grassroots masses.

    After going down to the grassroots level to work, leading cadres at all levels have been going deep into workshops to grasp production in a down-to-earth manner, going deep among the masses to grasp ideology, and going deep into the dining halls to grasp livelihood. As a result, they have gained a more concrete and detailed understanding of the situation in grassroots units. By going deep into the grassroots level, breaking through at one point, and gaining experience, they then use this experience to guide other units. For example, the responsible comrades of the Municipal Basic Construction Committee worked with the workers on a key construction site to research and collect the achievements of technological revolution from various production plants and mines, using them to improve the technical design of new plants and mines, saving a large amount of construction materials and accelerating the construction progress. Later, this experience was promoted throughout the city's basic construction departments, sparking a surge in improving design work, which quickly achieved results. According to statistics from only seven basic construction units, such as the Chemical Machinery Factory and the Suzhou Valve Factory, improving the original design could save more than 160 tons of steel and more than 650 tons of cement.

    In the process of organizing cadres from organs to go down to the grassroots level to work, the Suzhou Municipal Party Committee paid attention to conducting meticulous ideological education for the cadres, resolving the one-sided understanding of some cadres who believed that going down to the grassroots level to work was not very meaningful and that departmental work and central work could not be well integrated, and helped them establish a correct attitude. The Municipal Party Committee also took various measures to streamline meetings, streamline reports, and stipulate that the convening of city-wide meetings must be approved by the Municipal Party Committee. As a result, the number of meetings in various units has been reduced by more than half, greatly reducing the administrative work of the organs and ensuring that the cadres of the organs can concentrate their energy on going deep into the grassroots level.

### 深入车间抓生产　深入食堂抓生活  苏州机关干部下厂办公

    深入车间抓生产　深入食堂抓生活
    苏州机关干部下厂办公
    本报讯　江苏省苏州市市、区级机关领导干部，最近都下到工厂企业办公，在生产第一线建立现场指挥所，参加生产领导生产，促使生产节节上升。生铁产量5月下旬比上中旬增长31％，6月份头五天又比5月下旬增长18％。
    苏州市市、区级机关，除留下必要的干部外，都分别在5月中旬搬至基层办公。工业、交通、基本建设等部门都深入本系统所属基层单位，划片定点，以点带面。党群、政法等领导部门，也分别深入到工业系统的先进或后进单位，建立基点，围绕工业生产，开展本身工作。市委第一书记焦康寿同志和书记处的其他书记都以身作则，把铺盖搬到重点钢铁厂或基本建设工地，深入炉前或施工现场，参加劳动，领导生产。在市委负责同志的带领下，全市下基层办公的干部共两千多人，占市、区机关全体干部的80％，绝大部分同志都做到了与基层群众同吃、同住、同劳动。
    下基层办公以后，各级领导干部都踏踏实实地深入车间抓生产，深入群众抓思想，深入食堂抓生活，因而对基层单位的情况了解得更加具体，更加细致。通过深入基层，突破一点，取得经验后，就利用这种经验去指导其他单位。例如，市基本建设委员会负责同志在一个重点工地上同职工一起研究，搜集各生产厂矿技术革命的成果，据以改进新厂矿的技术设计，节约了大量建筑材料，加快了施工进度。以后，又把这一经验在全市基本建设部门中推广，掀起了一个改进设计工作的热潮，很快取得了成绩。仅据化工机械厂、苏州阀门厂等七个基本建设单位的统计，改进原设计后就可以节约钢材一百六十多吨，水泥六百五十多吨。
    苏州市委在组织机关干部下基层办公的过程中，注意对干部进行细致的思想教育，解决了部分干部认为下基层办公意义不大、部门工作和中心工作不能很好结合的片面认识，使他们树立了正确的态度。市委还采取各种措施，精简会议，精简报表，规定开全市性的会议要经市委批准，因而各单位的会议减少了一半以上，大大地减少了机关的事务工作，保证机关干部能够集中精力深入基层。
