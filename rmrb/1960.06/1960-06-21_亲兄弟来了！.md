    Dear Brothers Have Arrived!
    Our banner hadn't had a drop of rain for more than half a month, starting in mid-May. On May 31st, there was a thorough rain, and the commune members were extremely happy. Everyone said: If we could seize the opportunity to rush planting immediately after the rain, we wouldn't miss the farming season, wouldn't that be great! However, seeing that the planting season was about to pass, there was still a lot of land that hadn't been planted. The commune's labor and animal power were limited, and everyone was worried about this.
    The workers of Baotou Iron and Steel Company, Baotou No. 1 and No. 2 Machinery Plants, Baotou No. 1 and No. 2 Industrial Bureaus, and other units learned about this. Although their production was also very tense and every second counted, in order to guarantee a bumper grain harvest this year, they overcame various difficulties and successively organized a support team of more than 1,500 people, drove seven tractors, and brought a large number of farm tools, arriving in our banner in a mighty manner. They also selected one hundred workers who could repair tractors and diesel engines to support us, afraid that our machines would break down and we wouldn't be able to repair them. Look how thoughtful they are.
    When the news of Baotou city workers supporting the rush planting spread to us, the commune members said gratefully: Workers and peasants are truly dear brothers. As soon as they hear we have difficulties, the elder brothers immediately send a support team. This year, we must have a bumper grain harvest, and we must also grow more good vegetables to ensure that the worker elder brothers have enough fresh vegetables to eat.
    With the meeting of workers and peasants, fighting shoulder to shoulder, the daily planting area of the entire banner increased by more than 2,000 mu. Some communes victoriously overfulfilled their annual planting plan in just two days.

    亲兄弟来了！
    我们旗从5月中旬起，有半个多月没下一滴雨。5月31日下了一场透雨，社员们可高兴极了。大家都说：要是能够趁雨后马上抢种，就不会误农时，那该有多好吧！可是，眼看播种期就要过去了，还有很多地没有种上，社里的劳力、畜力都有限，大家都为这事着急。
    这件事叫包头钢铁公司、包头市第一、二机械厂、包头市第一、二工业局等单位的工人们知道了，虽然他们的生产也是争分夺秒地十分紧张，但是，为了保证今年粮食大丰收，他们克服了种种困难，先后组织了一支一千五百多人的支援大队，开了七台拖拉机，带了大批农具，浩浩荡荡地到我们旗来了。他们还挑选了一百个会修理拖拉机、柴油机的工人来支援我们，怕我们机器出了毛病修不了，你看他们想得多周到。
    当包头市工人支援抢种的消息传到我们这里之后，社员们感激地说：工人和农民真是亲兄弟，一听说咱们有了困难，老大哥就立刻派来了支援队。今年我们一定要让粮食来个大丰收，还要多种些好蔬菜，保证让工人老大哥有足够的新鲜蔬菜吃。
    在工农会师，并肩作战下，全旗每天的播种面积提高二千多亩，有些公社两天就胜利地超额完成了全年的播种计划。
