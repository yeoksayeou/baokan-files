Xinhua News Agency, 9th. The Eleventh Session of the Council of the World Federation of Trade Unions today adopted the "Resolution on the Contribution of Trade Unions to the Struggle Against Colonialism," the full text of which is as follows:

The Eleventh Session of the Council of the World Federation of Trade Unions notes with satisfaction that since the Fourth World Trade Union Congress, the national liberation movement, in which the trade union movement plays an important role, has developed at an astonishing speed and continues to develop, which clearly proves that the Fourth Congress's resolution on the tasks of trade unions in the struggle against colonialism is correct.

The Council points out that the rapid development and consolidation of the socialist camp, the development and consolidation of forces opposing colonialism and forces for peace and democracy, and the continuously growing strength of the world's workers' movement have led to a continuous reduction in the strength of imperialist forces and have created favorable conditions for the victorious struggle of the people against colonialism and for national independence.

Since the Fourth Congress, the arduous struggle waged by the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries has led to the attainment of national independence by many countries. But there are still millions of men and women, mainly in Africa, who remain under the shackles of colonialism. And many young countries in Asia, Africa, and even Latin America still suffer the consequences of colonialism.

The pressure of national liberation movements has made it impossible for colonialists to continue their rule in traditional forms. Therefore, they are attempting to use "constitutional" or "administrative" reforms, which in essence are merely the development of colonialism in new forms. While being forced to make certain political concessions, the colonialists are also trying to maintain or even expand their economic rule.

The Council believes that while the workers and patriotic forces in the colonies regard these concessions by the colonialists as achievements of their national liberation movement, they should make the people clearly aware that they must not be blinded or complacent by these initial achievements, but should continue the struggle until the complete elimination of colonialist influence, especially in the economic sphere.

The Council also calls on workers and trade unions in all countries to be vigilant against "neo-colonialism" in the struggle for national independence, which the imperialists and their followers are using in an attempt to expand and strengthen their position in the colonies and countries that have recently gained independent strength.

Faced with the various actions of U.S. imperialism, workers must be especially vigilant against the so-called economic assistance used by U.S. imperialism to strengthen its control over these countries and force them to accept military treaties. U.S. imperialism wears the mask of "anti-colonialism" but remains the most ferocious enemy of the people of all countries fighting for independence. This mask should be torn off, and its anti-people nature must be exposed to the whole world and to all workers. Workers should also be vigilant against the attempts of West German monopoly capital to infiltrate, especially in Africa and the Near and Middle East.

The Council emphasizes that the struggle of the people of all countries against colonialism cannot allow the colonialists of another imperialist country to invade while expelling the colonialists of one imperialist country. These struggles of the people should be directed against all forms of colonialism.

The Council notes that the long-term rule and exploitation of capitalism have continuously worsened the labor and living conditions of workers in colonial countries and have caused unbearable suffering to all working people in these countries.

Despite the harsh conditions and cruel persecution, the struggle of workers against this inhuman life has greatly developed throughout the colonial world. Workers in colonial countries are increasingly participating in the struggle to achieve their demands.

Due to the continuous improvement of the consciousness of the working class, all these struggles show higher tenacity and militancy than before.

The Council fully supports the demands put forward in these struggles, mainly:

	--General wage increases and the establishment of minimum guaranteed wages;
	--Implementation of the principle of equal pay for equal work, elimination of racial discrimination in wages and family allowances;
	--Lowering the cost of living and opposing the increase in the price of daily consumer goods;
	--Freedom to choose a professional job and to receive vocational training without any discrimination;
	--Shortening working hours, enacting and implementing legislation on the eight-hour working day, limiting overtime work, implementing and increasing annual paid leave;
	--Improving safety measures to prevent industrial accidents and occupational diseases;
	--Opposition to dismissal and unemployment;
	--Guaranteeing reasonable working and living conditions for foreign migrant workers;
	--Abolishing all forms of forced labor;
	--Implementing and improving the social insurance system;
	--Improving living conditions and medical and educational facilities, making them of sufficient quantity and satisfactory quality;
	--Free schooling for children without discrimination, and the establishment of an education system that conforms to the culture and national aspirations of the people of all countries;
	--Implementing land reform, abolishing capitalist and other large land ownership systems, and giving farmers land, seeds, and loans.

The Council condemns the colonialists' brutal suppression of trade unions and democratic rights, which is aimed at suppressing the development of the struggle of workers and peasants and continuing the colonialists' rule.

The Council once again strongly condemns the colonialist war in Algeria, condemns the racist policies of the government of the Union of South Africa, where workers and peasants are subjected to massacres and bloody terror, and condemns the anti-democratic regimes in certain countries in the Near and Middle East and Africa.

The Council expresses its deep sympathy to the victims in the struggle and expresses its full support to all those imprisoned for the interests of the workers and the struggle for national independence. The Council demands that the authorities immediately stop the persecution of trade union workers and workers, and guarantee the free exercise of trade union rights and democratic freedoms.

The Council firmly believes that in these countries, only complete national independence can provide favorable conditions for progress and meeting the economic and social demands of workers. Therefore, the Council recommends that workers participate more and more actively in the national liberation movement and play a leading role in organizing and consolidating a national united front based on the alliance of workers and peasants, including all other anti-colonialist forces.

In the struggle against colonialism, the desire for the unity of the working class and the solidarity of the people of all countries is becoming stronger and stronger. The Council welcomes the good results of the All-African People's Conference and the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, and supports the call of African trade union workers for the establishment of an All-African Trade Union Federation to unite all trade union organizations in Africa, hoping that it can contribute to strengthening the people's struggle against colonialism and to rebuilding the unity of the international trade union movement. The Council condemns the activities of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions to undermine the unity of African trade unions. These activities show that this organization, for the greatest interests of the imperialists, wants to maintain the division between African workers.

For the victory of the workers' struggle, for the victory of the struggle to defend their current interests, national independence, and the thorough elimination of colonialism, a strong trade union movement must be established on a democratic and class basis, which can unite more and more workers, regardless of their race, religion, or opinion.

The Council emphasizes that some reformist trade union leaders, relying on the support of the leaders of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, have set up various obstacles to trade union unity. The activities of these splitters are in line with the colonialists' and reactionaries' attempts to weaken the trade union movement in order to exploit the working masses to the maximum extent.

In some countries, bourgeois elements are using the sacrifices made by workers and trade union organizations in the liberation struggle, attempting to force trade unions to give up certain demands, even very small demands. They are trying to place trade union organizations under the control of the ruling bourgeois party or to deprive trade unions of the achievements they have gained during the national unity period of the liberation struggle.

Therefore, the Council believes that in the struggle for national liberation, all trade union organizations have the responsibility to:

	--Implement democratic principles in trade unions, eliminate the gap between the grassroots and the leaders, in order to develop a truly mass trade union movement;
	--Maintain the class nature of the trade union movement, establish relations with bourgeois political parties on the basis of cooperation in the common struggle against colonialism, and never give up the immediate interests of the working class at any time;
	--Formulate a complete common action program during the national liberation struggle, and once independence is achieved, formulate a well-studied plan to build a national industry, with the aim of thoroughly eliminating colonialism and implementing independent domestic and foreign policies.

The Council emphasizes that the solidarity of international workers plays an effective role in the development of the struggle against colonialism. The Council urges workers and trade unions to pay attention to the conspiracy of the imperialists, who want to isolate the working class of colonial countries from their allies in those countries that have been freed from the capitalist system, and from the workers' movement in imperialist countries that actively support the liberation movement. This isolation will deprive the people who are engaged in the anti-colonialist struggle of the unconditional and indispensable assistance in their struggle and economic construction once they have achieved national independence; this isolation also deprives the world's peace forces of the contribution that the national liberation movement can make in the struggle for world peace.

If the trade union organizations of these countries adopt the principle of cooperation and mutual support with the international trade union movement, they can concretely demonstrate the importance of international proletarian solidarity, thereby also demonstrating the importance of the active participation of the people of all countries in international life to strengthen the anti-colonialist struggle.

The Council calls on workers and trade union organizations around the world to further develop and strengthen their mutual solidarity in the anti-colonialist struggle.

Since the Fourth World Trade Union Congress, the World Federation of Trade Unions has been intensifying its efforts to strengthen international solidarity and to provide increasingly effective support to workers and trade unions in those countries that are fighting against colonialism (regardless of which international organization they belong to). The Council instructs the Executive Committee and Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions to continue to move forward in this regard. The World Federation of Trade Unions continues to be the main force in organizing trade unions in all countries around the world to actively support the struggle against colonialism and for national independence.

The Council of the World Federation of Trade Unions specifically requires all its member organizations, the Executive Committee and the Secretariat to strengthen this support in the following aspects:

	1. In the struggle waged by workers and people in the Union of South Africa against the most barbaric suppression and exploitation based on racial segregation and racial discrimination, it calls on trade union organizations around the world (regardless of which international organization they belong to) to take joint and concerted action.

	Trade union organizations that have expressed support for workers in the Union of South Africa and trade union organizations that will participate in this movement can work together in an international committee to support workers and people in the Union of South Africa. The Council calls on all trade union organizations to join this committee and asks the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions to take the necessary measures to establish this committee and organize its work.

	2. The rapid development of trade unions in colonial and underdeveloped countries, the increasingly important role played by these trade unions in the anti-colonialist struggle, and the greater responsibilities they bear in the new situation of the booming national liberation movement, make it urgently necessary for these trade union organizations to train many trade union cadres. In seeing the great efforts made in this regard by the relevant trade union organizations, the World Federation of Trade Unions, and its member organizations, the Council believes that efforts must be further intensified in this regard.

	The Council calls on its member groups to cooperate through the Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions so that the largest number of trade union cadres in colonial and underdeveloped countries can receive the indispensable trade union education.

	3. It calls on member groups of the World Federation of Trade Unions, especially member groups in socialist countries, to give young workers in colonial and underdeveloped countries the opportunity to enjoy vocational education.

	4. The Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions has sent some experts on special issues such as social insurance to trade union organizations in colonial and underdeveloped countries. Based on the experience of the Secretariat, the Council requires all member groups to provide assistance in this regard to the extent possible, each time they are requested for assistance.

	5. The World Federation of Trade Unions and its member groups express great sympathy and support to trade union cadres who have been persecuted and imprisoned for carrying out the anti-colonialist struggle. The Council believes that an international trade union delegation can be organized to go to the scene to investigate the situation of the detainees, inform the trade unions of the world about these situations, strengthen the struggle to fight for the release of the detainees, and submit reports to the international organizations.

	6. In order to ensure the widest possible dissemination of news about trade unions engaged in the anti-colonialist struggle in Africa, the Council requests the Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions to study the possibility of issuing an African Trade Union News Bulletin, the content of which may include news of the anti-colonialist struggle and the struggle for a better life conducted by African trade unions. The Council believes that such a bulletin will help to expand solidarity in the struggle against colonialism.

The Council is deeply convinced that with the increasingly active support of workers around the world, the day is not far off when all oppressed nations will be freed from the colonial yoke.

### 把反殖民主义斗争进行到底  提高对“新殖民主义”的警惕  世界工联理事会议关于工会在反对殖民主义斗争中所作贡献的决议

    把反殖民主义斗争进行到底  提高对“新殖民主义”的警惕
    世界工联理事会议关于工会在反对殖民主义斗争中所作贡献的决议
    新华社9日讯　世界工会联合会理事会第十一次会议今天通过的“关于工会在反对殖民主义斗争中所作贡献的决议”，全文如下：
    世界工会联合会理事会第十一次会议满意地注意到，自从世界工会第四届代表大会以来，工会运动在其中起着重要作用的民族解放运动，已经以惊人的速度取得了发展并且继续在发展，这种发展清楚地证明，第四届代表大会关于工会在反对殖民主义斗争中的任务的决议是正确的。
    理事会指出：社会主义阵营的迅速发展和巩固团结，反对殖民主义的力量及和平和民主力量的发展和巩固，全世界工人运动的不断增长的力量，使得帝国主义力量不断缩减，并为人民反对殖民主义、要求民族独立的胜利斗争创造了有利条件。
    自从第四届代表大会以来，殖民地和半殖民地国家的人民所进行的艰苦斗争，使得很多国家获得了民族独立。但是还有千百万男男女女，主要在非洲，依旧处在殖民主义枷锁的束缚下。而亚洲、非洲甚至拉丁美洲许多年青的国家还承担着殖民主义及其影响的恶果。
    民族解放运动的压力使得殖民主义者无法使用传统的形式来继续它们的统治。因此它们正在企图试用“宪法的”或“行政的”改革，实质上，这只是殖民主义在新形式下的发展。殖民主义者在被迫作出某些政治上的让步的同时，还设法想维持或甚至扩张他们经济上的统治。
    理事会认为，殖民地的工人和爱国力量在把殖民主义者的这种让步看作是他们的民族解放运动的成就的同时，应当使人民认识清楚，不能为这些初步的成就所蒙蔽或感到满足，而应当继续进行斗争，直到完全消除殖民主义的影响，特别是在经济方面。
    理事会并且号召各国工人和工会在争取民族独立的斗争中要对“新殖民主义”提高警惕，帝国主义者及其仆从们利用“新殖民主义”来企图扩大和加强他们在殖民地及最近得到力量独立的国家中的地位。
    面对着美帝国主义的种种行为，工人们必须特别警惕，美帝国主义利用所谓的经济援助，想来加强它们对这些国家控制，并迫使他们接受军事条约。美帝国主义戴着“反殖民主义”的假面具，但依然是为争取独立而斗争的各国人民的最凶恶的敌人。应该把这个假面具给它揭下来，它的反人民的性质，必须在全世界面前和所有工人面前予以揭露。工人们也应该警惕西德垄断资本侵入的企图，特别在非洲和中近东。
    理事会强调，各国人民反对殖民主义的斗争不能在逐出某一帝国主义国家的殖民主义者的同时，允许另一个帝国主义国家的殖民主义者侵入。人民的这些斗争应当针对殖民主义的一切形式。
    理事会注意到，资本主义的长期统治和剥削，使殖民地国家工人的劳动和生活条件不断地恶化，并使这些国家的全体劳动人民遭受难以忍受的痛苦。
    尽管条件艰苦和残酷的迫害，工人反对这种非人生活的斗争在整个殖民世界得到很大发展。殖民地各国工人越来越多地参加了争取实现他们的要求的斗争。
    由于工人阶级的觉悟不断提高，所有这些斗争都显出较前更高的坚韧性和斗争性。
    理事会完全支持在这些斗争中所提出要求，主要是：
    ——普遍增加工资和制订最低保证工资；
    ——实行同工同酬的原则，消除工资及家庭津贴等方面的种族歧视；
    ——降低生活费用，反对提高日常消费品的价格；
    ——自由选择专业的工作，并且不受任何歧视地接受职业训练；
    ——缩短工时，制定八小时工作制的立法并加以实施，限制加班加点，实行和增加每年工资照付的假期；
    ——改善安全措施，防止工伤事故和职业病；
    ——反对解雇和失业；
    ——保证外来移民工人合理的工作和生活条件；
    ——废除一切形式的强迫劳动；
    ——实施和改善社会保险制度；
    ——改善居住条件和医疗教育设施，使有足够的数量和令人满意的质量；
    ——不加歧视地使儿童免费就学，建立符合于各国人民的文化和民族愿望的教育制度；
    ——实行土地改革，废除资本主义的以及其他的大土地所有制，给农民土地、种籽和贷款。
    理事会谴责殖民主义者对工会和民主权利的横暴镇压，这种镇压的目的在于压止工人和农民的斗争的发展并继续殖民主义者的统治。
    理事会再次有力地谴责在阿尔及利亚的殖民主义战争，谴责南非联邦政府的种族主义政策，在南非联邦工人和农民受到屠杀和血腥恐怖之害，谴责中近东和非洲某些国家的反民主政权。
    理事会对在斗争中的受害者表示深切同情，并对一切为工人利益和民族独立斗争而被监禁着的人们表示全力支援。理事会要求当局立即停止对工会工作者及工人的迫害，保证自由地行使工会权利和民主自由。
    理事会坚信，在这些国家，只有完全的民族独立才能为进步和满足工人的经济和社会要求提供有利的条件。因此，理事会建议工人越来越积极地参加民族解放运动，并在组织和巩固以工农联盟为基础、包括其他一切反殖民主义力量的民族统一战线中起领导作用。
    在反殖民主义的斗争中，要求工人阶级的统一和各国人民的团结的愿望越来越强烈了。理事会欢迎全非人民会议和亚非人民团结大会的良好结果，并支持非洲工会工作者要求建立全非工会联合会以团结非洲所有工会组织的呼吁，希望该会能为加强人民反对殖民主义的斗争并为重建国际工会的统一而做出贡献。理事会谴责国际自由工联所进行的破坏非洲工会团结的活动。这些活动表明，这个组织为了帝国主义者的最大利益，想维持非洲工人之间的分裂状态。
    为了工人斗争胜利，为了保卫他们的目前利益、民族独立和彻底铲除殖民主义的斗争取得胜利，必须在民主和阶级的基础上建立一个强大的工会运动，这个运动要能够团结越来越多的工人，不管他们的种族、宗教和见解如何。
    理事会议着重指出，某些改良主义的工会领袖，依靠国际自由工联的领导人的支持，为工会统一设置了种种障碍。这些分裂分子的活动是符合于殖民主义者和反动派企图削弱工会运动以便最大限度地剥削工人群众的目的的。
    在某些国家，资产阶级分子正利用工人和工会组织在解放斗争中付出的牺牲，企图强迫工会放弃某些要求，即使是很微小的要求。他们力图把工会组织置于资产阶级执政党的控制之下，或剥夺工会在解放斗争的民族统一时期所获得的成果。
    因此，理事会认为，在为争取国家的解放而斗争时，一切工会组织有责任：
    ——使工会实行民主原则，消除基层和领袖之间的隔阂，以便开展一个真正的群众性的工会运动；
    ——保持工会运动的阶级性，以在反对殖民主义的共同斗争的合作为基础，与资产阶级政党建立关系，在任何时候也不放弃工人阶级的切身利益；
    ——制定在民族解放斗争期间的完整的共同行动的纲领，一旦获得独立以后，就要制订一个经过周密研究的建设民族工业的计划，其目的在于彻底清除殖民主义，执行独立的内政和外交政策。
    理事会强调，国际工人的团结，在反对殖民主义斗争的发展方面起着有效的作用。理事会促请工人和工会注意帝国主义的阴谋，他们想使殖民地国家的工人阶级与已经摆脱了资本主义制度的那些国家中的同盟者隔绝起来，与帝国主义国家中积极支持解放运动的工人运动隔绝起来。这种孤立状态将会使正在进行反殖民主义斗争的人民在一旦获得民族独立以后，得不到在他们的斗争中和经济建设方面无条件的不可缺少的援助；这种孤立状态也使世界和平力量得不到民族解放运动在争取世界和平的斗争中能够作出的贡献。
    这些国家的工会组织如果采取和国际工会运动合作和相互支援的原则，就能够具体表现出国际无产阶级团结的重要性，从而也表现出各国人民积极参加国际生活以加强反殖民主义斗争的重要性。
    理事会号召全世界的工人和工会组织进一步发展和加强它们在反殖民主义斗争中的相互团结。
    自从世界工会第四次代表大会以来，世界工联一直在加紧努力，以加强国际团结，并给予正在反殖民主义的那些国家的工人和工会
  （不论它们属于那个国际组织）以日益有效的支持。理事会责成世界工联执行委员会和书记处在这方面继续前进。世界工联继续是组织全世界各国工会积极支援反对殖民主义和争取民族独立的斗争的主要力量。
    世界工联理事会特别要求它的一切会员组织、执行委员会和书记处在以下几方面加强这种支持：
    1、为反对最野蛮的以种族隔离和种族歧视为基础的镇压和剥削，南非联邦工人和人民所进行的斗争，要求全世界工会组织（不论它们属于那个国际组织）采取共同和联合行动。
    已经表示支持南非联邦工人的工会组织和将要参加这一运动的工会组织，可以在一个支援南非联邦工人和人民国际委员会中一起工作。理事会呼吁一切工会组织参加这个委员会，并要求世界工联执行委员会为建立这个委员会和组织它的工作采取必要的措施。
    2、殖民地和不发达国家工会的迅速发展，这些工会在反殖民主义斗争中所起的愈来愈重要的作用，以及在民族解放运动蓬勃发展的新的情况下，它们所担负的更重大的责任，使这些工会组织迫切需要培养许多工会干部。在看到有关工会组织、世界工联及其会员组织在这方面已作了巨大努力的时候，理事会认为在这方面必须进一步加紧努力。
    理事会号召它的会员团体通过世界工联书记处进行协作，使殖民地和不发达国家最大量的工会干部能受到不可缺少的工会教育。
    3、要求世界工联的会员团体，特别是社会主义国家的会员团体能给予殖民地和不发达国家的青年工人以享受职业教育的机会。
    4、世界工联书记处曾给殖民地和不发达国家的工会组织派去一些诸如社会保险等特殊问题的专家，根据书记处的经验，理事会要求所有会员团体在这方面在可能的范围内，在每次向它们要求援助时给予援助。
    5、世界工联和它的会员团体对由于进行反殖民主义斗争而遭到迫害和被捕入狱的工会干部表示极大的同情和支持。理事会认为可以组织一个国际工会代表团到现场去调查被拘禁者的情况，使全世界的工会知道这些情况，来加强为争取释放拘禁者的斗争，并向各国际组织提出报告。
    6、为了保证能最广泛地传播关于在非洲进行反殖民主义斗争的工会的消息，理事会要求世界工联书记处研究发行一份非洲工会新闻公报的可能性，其内容可包括非洲工会进行的反殖民主义和争取较好的生活的消息。理事会认为，这样一种公报会有助于扩大在反殖民主义的斗争中的团结。
    理事会深信，在全世界工人日益积极的支持下，一切被压迫民族从殖民枷锁中解放出来的日子不远了。　1960年6月9日于北京
