    A Highly Effective Indigenous Pesticide
    Veratrum Nigrum Insecticide
    Veratrum Nigrum insecticide is made by steeping and boiling the wild poisonous plant Veratrum Nigrum (belonging to the lily family, scientific name *Veratrum nigrum*, perennial herb) liquid and diluting it with water. This medicine contains alkaloids that can kill insects (stomach poison, contact poison) and can kill locusts, leafhoppers, rice planthoppers, rice borers, aphids, etc. The insecticidal rate can reach 100%. The masses call it a surefire panacea. In 1959, 36 brigades in various communes in Taining County, Fujian Province, used this indigenous pesticide to control insects, exterminating pests that harmed crops such as rice, wheat, and beans, which not only ensured the realization of the grain production increase target, but also saved the communes more than 1,800 yuan in pesticide purchase costs.
    This indigenous pesticide was successfully tested by Liao Qinggui, an old farmer in Taining County, Fujian Province. It was rated first among more than 100 kinds of indigenous pesticides identified by the Nanping Prefectural Agricultural Science Institute of Fujian Province. This pesticide was sent to the National Agricultural Exhibition Hall for exhibition.

    一种药效高的土农药
    山葱兜杀虫剂
    山葱兜杀虫剂是野生有毒植物山葱兜（属百合科、学名黎芦、多年生草本）浸煮液掺水配制的。这种药含有可以杀虫（胃毒、触杀）的生物碱，能杀除蝗虫、浮尘子、稻飞虱、螟虫、蚜虫等，杀虫率可到百分之百，群众叫它是百发百中的神药。一九五九年福建泰宁县各公社的三十六个大队由于使用这种土农药治虫，扑灭了危害稻、麦、豆类等作物的害虫，既保证了粮食增产指标的实现，又为公社节省了一千八百多元的购买农药的费用。
    这种土农药是福建泰宁县老农廖清贵试验成功的。在福建南平专区农科所鉴定的一百多种土农药中，它被评为第一。这种农药曾送给全国农业展览馆展出。
