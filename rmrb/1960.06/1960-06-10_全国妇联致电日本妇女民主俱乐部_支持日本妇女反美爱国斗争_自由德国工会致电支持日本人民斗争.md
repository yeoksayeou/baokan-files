Xinhua News Agency, June 9th. The All-China Women's Federation of the People's Republic of China today sent a telegram to the Japanese Women's Democratic Club, expressing warm congratulations on their fifteenth national congress to be held on the 11th and 12th.

The All-China Women's Federation's telegram said that the broad masses of women and mothers in Japan, with firm will and orderly steps, have actively and bravely joined the heroic struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, and have formed an important force in the struggle. Chinese women extend their warmest congratulations and highest respect to the Japanese people and women for the great achievements they have already made in this great struggle concerning the fate of the Japanese nation and the peace of Asia and the world.

The telegram said: "The conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys to revive Japanese militarism and plan new wars has been fully exposed. The Japanese people and women, who have suffered the disasters of aggressive wars and have been subjected to American enslavement and plunder, will never allow their conspiracy to succeed. The Japanese people and women, who have been tempered in seventeen consecutive unified actions and are becoming more closely united, will surely be able to finally smash the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and smash the frantic counter-attacks and suppression of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

Chinese women will always stand with their Japanese brothers and sisters and fight shoulder to shoulder to the end against U.S. imperialism, the common enemy of the people of the world."

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 5th. According to the German News Agency: The Central Council of the Free German Trade Union Federation sent a telegram to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, extending fraternal combat greetings to all the working people of Japan who are fighting against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. The telegram wishes the Japanese people complete victory in their struggle against U.S. imperialism and its atomic war policy, and against the Japan-U.S. military treaty.

The Central Council of the Free German Trade Union Federation emphasized in the telegram that the large-scale struggle launched by the Japanese working people against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty is a strong support for the German people's struggle against West German imperialism and militarism.
