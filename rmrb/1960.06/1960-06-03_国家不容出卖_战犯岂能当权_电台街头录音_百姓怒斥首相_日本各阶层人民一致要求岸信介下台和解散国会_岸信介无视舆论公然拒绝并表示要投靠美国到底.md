Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd: People from all walks of life in Japan spoke out yesterday on a special "Street Recording" program organized by Tokyo Broadcasting Station, demanding the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet. A young man from Osaka severely criticized Kishi Nobusuke's slavish attitude of following the United States in a recorded broadcast and demanded his immediate resignation.

A woman from Tokyo said, "We must never forget that Kishi Nobusuke is a war criminal."

A student said, "Kishi Nobusuke must resign immediately; form a temporary cabinet; dissolve the Diet; and hold a general election."

A housewife said, "I demand the immediate dissolution of the Diet. For more than ten years, my seven children have been opposed to letting the country be in a state of subservience to U.S. imperialism."

A citizen of Osaka condemned the Kishi Nobusuke group's use of violence to forcibly "vote" on the new "Security Treaty," and he demanded that Kishi Nobusuke confess his crimes to the people.

These people's speeches were warmly welcomed by the broad masses participating in the "Street Recording." Their talks were often interrupted by thunderous applause.

However, Kishi Nobusuke, hiding in the Tokyo official residence, ignored the people's protests and shamelessly claimed again when answering questions from reporters of this radio station that "working hand in hand with the United States to revise the Security Treaty...this is my confidence, and I must complete it," and said that he would "not succumb to the Socialist Party's 'violence'." Kishi Nobusuke also stubbornly stated that he "does not want to resign and does not think it appropriate to dissolve the Diet."

In addition, when people from all walks of life were making recorded speeches at Shinbashi Station in Tokyo, about a hundred members of the Liberal Democratic Party and its lackeys surrounded the microphone, attempting to sabotage the recording. However, this group of ruffians was strongly condemned by the broad masses, and in the end, they had to get into pre-arranged cars and flee in disgrace.

Today, the "Asahi Shimbun" and "Mainichi Shimbun" newspapers published articles respectively, condemning the Liberal Democratic Party members' violent act of occupying the microphone.

    国家不容出卖　战犯岂能当权
    电台街头录音　百姓怒斥首相
    日本各阶层人民一致要求岸信介下台和解散国会
    岸信介无视舆论公然拒绝并表示要投靠美国到底
    新华社2日讯　东京消息：日本各阶层人民昨天在东京广播电台组织的“街上录音”特别节目中，纷纷发言，要求岸信介内阁下台和解散国会。大阪的一个青年在录音广播里严厉指责岸信介追随美国的奴才态度，并且要求他立即下台。
    东京一位妇女说，我们千万不要忘记岸信介是一个战犯。
    一名学生说，岸信介必须立即下台；组织临时内阁；解散国会；举行大选。
    一位家庭妇女说，我要求立即解散国会。十多年来，我的七个孩子一直反对让国家处在屈从于美帝国主义的状态。
    大阪一个市民谴责了岸信介集团使用暴力强行“表决”新“安全条约”，他要求岸信介向人民认罪。
    这些人的发言受到了参加“街上录音”的广大群众的热烈欢迎。他们的谈话常常为春雷般的掌声所打断。
    但是，躲在东京官邸里面的岸信介在回答这家电台记者提出的问题时，竟不顾人民的一片抗议声再一次厚颜无耻地声称“同美国携手修改安全条约……这是我的信心，我一定要使它完成”，并且说什么他“不屈服于社会党的‘暴力’”，岸信介还顽固地表示他“不想辞职，对于解散国会也认为不适当”。
    另外，当各阶层人民在东京新桥车站发表录音谈话时，有大约一百名自由民主党的党徒和它的走卒包围了麦克风，企图破坏录音。但是这群无赖之徒遭到广大群众强烈的谴责，最后只得乘上预先准备好的汽车狼狈地逃跑了。
    今天，“朝日新闻”“每日新闻”两家报纸分别发表文章，谴责自由民主党党徒霸占麦克风的暴行。
