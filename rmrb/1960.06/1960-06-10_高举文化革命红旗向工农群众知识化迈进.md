Hold High the Red Flag of the Cultural Revolution and Advance Towards the Intellectualization of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers
Representative of the Xiufeng Brigade Spare-time School, Gutian County, Fujian Province: Wang Jinjiao

I am the vice-principal and a student of the Xiufeng Brigade Spare-time School in Daqiao Commune, Gutian County, Fujian Province. I am very happy to be here in the capital to attend this conference.

Xiufeng is a remote mountain village with scattered settlements. The brigade has nineteen natural villages, the furthest being more than twenty li apart, and the nearest being two or three li apart. Before liberation, the masses here lived in extreme poverty. At that time, among the young and middle-aged people in the whole township, only the son of a landlord had studied in the first year of junior high school, eleven rich middle peasants had a rough knowledge of some characters, and the rest were all illiterate. The masses said: "With eyes but no knowledge, writing a letter requires traveling ten li to ask for help."

After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, with the development of production, the people of Xiufeng also turned over culturally. In 1951, winter schools were established; in 1956, a large-scale literacy campaign was launched; in July 1957, the township basically eliminated illiteracy; then, spare-time senior primary schools were popularized; and in 1958, spare-time junior high schools were established. Now, among the three hundred and eight young and middle-aged people in the whole brigade, two hundred and sixty-six are participating in spare-time junior high school studies, and the remaining forty-two are studying in spare-time senior primary schools, popularizing spare-time junior high school education. There are two hundred and one "junior high school families" in the whole brigade (all young and middle-aged people in the family are studying in spare-time junior high school). Comrade Chen Xican, the Party branch secretary, who was originally illiterate, is now a student in the second year of junior high school. He has not only learned to write summaries and work reports, but also written philosophical papers such as "Only Downstream Thinking, No Downstream Fields." Xiao Jinxian, the female township head, used to herd cattle for landlords at the age of seven. After liberation, she joined the people's school with me. After several years of hard study, she was admitted to the worker-peasant preparatory course at Xiamen University last year, and her academic performance is very good. The masses call her a female scholar. I also did not attend school when I was young and was illiterate. I only participated in spare-time school in 1951. Because my home was relatively far from the school, I had to run more than nine li back and forth every night. At first, my mother did not want me to go, saying, "There are ghosts and tigers at night," and "It is useless for women to study culture." I said to my mother, "I have never seen ghosts, that is superstition; it is as useful for women to study culture as it is for men. Now women can do what men can do, and if men want to study culture, so do women." So, I persuaded my mother. From the beginning of 1952 to the present eight and a half years, except for going out to meetings and being sick, I have insisted on going to the people's school every night, no matter how strong the wind, rain, frost, or snow is. Therefore, now I have also caught up with the spare-time junior high school class. People have calculated for me and said that the road I have traveled to the people's school in the past few years has exceeded 25,000 li.

Production Upsurge Promotes Cultural Upsurge

After liberation, with the arrival of the economic construction upsurge, a sharp contradiction appeared in our brigade, which is the contradiction between the needs of the socialist economic system and production development and the low cultural level of the broad masses, many of whom are still illiterate. Chairman Mao said that with the arrival of the upsurge of economic construction, an upsurge of cultural construction will inevitably appear. The "poor and blank" Xiufeng Brigade is particularly evident in this regard. Land reform set off a wave of running winter schools, agricultural cooperation set off a wave of literacy and spare-time education, and people's communization set off a wave of running spare-time junior high schools. This is because every time the political and economic situation advances, the backward culture cannot keep up. When there is a contradiction, it must be resolved. After one contradiction is resolved, a new contradiction arises, and then it is resolved again and arises again. This forms the characteristic of Xiufeng Brigade's three educational upsurges.

In 1952, Xiufeng Township carried out land reform, eliminated thousands of years of feudal exploitation, the relations of production changed, and the productive forces developed. The masses had a demand to revolutionize cultural backwardness and become true masters of culture. Under the promotion of the great production situation, the first upsurge of cultural learning was set off.

After the arrival of the upsurge of agricultural cooperation in 1955, the scale of production expanded, the number of management departments increased, and there was a particular feeling that there was a shortage of labor and a need to improve technology. Culture was needed everywhere in production and life. Cooperation required accounting, but those who could keep accounts were landlords, who were politically unreliable, while those who were reliable could not keep accounts. Cooperatives promoted technology, but the members could not read newspapers, and good experiences could not be learned. No one used the purchased sprayers, and each time "666" powder was used, it was necessary to run seven or eight li to ask someone to install it. Advanced technology was not easy to promote. Cadres listened to reports from higher authorities but could not take notes. Transmissions relied on memory, and documents could not be understood, making work difficult. Without culture, midwifery could not be promoted, scientific knowledge was difficult to popularize, and cultural and recreational activities were difficult to carry out. A sharp contradiction arose between building socialism and backward culture. Chairman Mao pointed out: "Our country now has so many illiterates, and socialist construction cannot wait until illiteracy is eliminated to begin... This serious problem must be resolved in the process of agricultural cooperation, and it can only be resolved in the process of agricultural cooperation." Chairman Mao's words pointed out the direction for rural literacy. Therefore, the township also launched a literacy upsurge in the development of the cooperation upsurge, and a heatwave of thousands of troops involved in production by day and a sound of reading by night emerged. The nine members of the Zhishan Village Women's Literacy Group had a total of twenty-six children, an average of almost three children per person. They still insisted on learning with the help of female students from spare-time schools. On rainy days, the masses from Qidui Village, four or five miles away, also brought cotton quilts to sleep in the people's school, and returned home at the crack of dawn the next day. In this way, it only took more than two years to eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people, and it took less than two years to overcome the spare-time senior primary school level, basically popularizing spare-time elementary education.

After the people's communes were established in 1958, the content of production became richer and the technology became more complex. In addition to the all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, the commune had to run industry, and the commune needed to train a group of its own intellectuals, technicians, and management cadres, such as hydropower station workers, blacksmiths, electricians, broadcasters, feeders, and agricultural technicians. The new situation of people's communization, the Great Leap Forward, and technological revolution demanded a third upsurge in learning. More than 85% of the students who graduated from spare-time senior primary school classes in the entire brigade transferred to spare-time junior high school classes.

Learn Culture with the Thought of Continuous Revolution

In the process of running schools, our Xiufeng Brigade Spare-time School was not without difficulties and ideological obstacles. Under the leadership of the Party branch, we always insisted on putting politics in command, insisted on the spirit of continuous revolution, so that after eliminating illiteracy and popularizing senior primary schools, we entered junior high school in one go, and held high the red flag of the cultural revolution. In the early stage of running schools, some cadres took an indifferent attitude towards the peasants' urgent demand for cultural emancipation, and completely opposed learning and production, saying that "peasants are those who use hoes and do not need culture" and "learning culture will affect production," so they did not actively lead the masses to study, and some even hindered it, causing the spare-time school to be run and stopped from time to time. The Party branch analyzed the reasons why the spare-time school was not running well at that time, mainly because the leadership did not grasp it tightly, and the cadres' ideological problems were not resolved. Therefore, the Party branch calculated the disadvantages of cultural backwardness among the cadres, criticized erroneous ideas, unified understanding, and the literacy work quickly and healthily unfolded. Now, in the process of developing and consolidating spare-time education and popularizing spare-time junior high schools, we have encountered many ideological obstacles. For example, when the spare-time senior primary school class transferred to the junior high school class, two ideological situations emerged: one was the idea of slackening and resting, such as some young and middle-aged people who thought that "it is enough to know a little bit of characters to farm in the mountains," some middle-aged people thought that "it is enough to be able to read books, newspapers, and keep work accounts when I get older. Going to junior high school is a matter for children," and some women said: "Stirring the pot does not require addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and washing the pot does not require junior high school students. A senior primary school level is almost enough." After learning about this situation, the Party branch proposed the slogan of "Hold high the red flag of the cultural revolution, greatly break the theory of 'enough is enough,' advance victoriously, and advance to junior high school," summarized the experience of literacy and organizing senior primary school classes, and held Party and Youth League branch meetings and spare-time school student meetings to conduct political and ideological education, and commended and rewarded a group of active students and activists who were enthusiastic about running schools. At the same time, it organized large-scale airing of views, debates, small group discussions, and individual mobilization and education. At the debate, everyone used the method of recalling the past, looking at the present, and looking forward to the future to solve ideological problems such as "Can the culture we are learning now meet the needs of socialist construction?" and "Do we need to continue to learn in order to realize the mechanization, water conservancy, and electrification of agriculture?" Another ideological problem was emphasizing "formalization," such as when senior primary schools transferred to junior high schools, a test was conducted to classify classes, and it was found that most students had reached the senior primary school graduation level in Chinese language, but their mathematics level was relatively poor. At this time, some people doubted that junior high school was "run too early" and "not like a junior high school," saying, "How can there be a middle school that teaches junior high school Chinese and elementary school arithmetic," and advocated canceling the junior high school groups and merging into large classes. The essence of this so-called "formal" thinking is that it does not want spare-time education and hinders the rapid improvement of spare-time education. The Party branch believes that according to the needs of the masses and the existing cultural situation, arranging junior high school classes according to the Chinese language level, focusing on learning junior high school Chinese first, and then gradually improving mathematics and natural science knowledge, not only meets the needs of the masses and accelerates the training of talents, but also combines with the current actual situation in rural areas, and it is also a normal phenomenon in the development process of rural spare-time education, which is in line with the spirit of popularizing while improving, and grasping improvement while popularizing. Therefore, it relied on the broad masses to refute this argument and resolutely ran the junior high school class.

Cadres "Grasp Two, Participate Two, and Take the Lead Two"

In carrying out mass learning movements, the Party branch paid attention to strengthening leadership, with the branch secretary personally taking command and implementing the practice of running schools by the whole Party and the whole people. From the secretary and branch committee members to ordinary cadres, all achieved "grasp two," "participate two," and "take the lead two," that is, grasping both production and learning; participating in production and taking the lead in production; participating in learning and taking the lead in learning, and adopted a contract responsibility system such as the secretary in charge of the overall situation, branch committee members in charge of different areas, and Party members and cadres in charge of teams, Party members, and League members in charge of groups and people, to achieve a unified team, two tasks, and "unitary" leadership of production and learning, with someone in charge at every level, down to the bottom. In order to strengthen the leadership of spare-time education, the Party and League branches also engaged in "experimental fields," such as the Party branch running a cadre study class, the Communist Youth League branch running a youth study class, and the Women's Federation running a women's study group. When the cadre class started to learn, there were many problems, especially since many cadres were scattered in different work areas, and work was busy, and meetings and learning often conflicted. Some cadres were called to meetings before they even sat down in the classroom; others "were in the classroom but their minds were on work," and could not persevere in learning, which affected the consolidation of the masses' learning. After discovering this situation, the Party branch believed that cadres were the main target of spare-time schools, and the political and cultural level of cadres was closely related to the quality of production and work. Although cadres were busy and had certain difficulties in learning culture, there were many favorable conditions, such as a more urgent demand for learning, more consistent learning and use, and a higher political level than the masses. Moreover, the quality of cadres' learning directly affects the learning of the masses. Therefore, the Party branch made up its mind to run the cadre class well and use it as an "experimental field" for leading learning. For the contradiction between work, meetings, and learning, the method of studying first and then studying work, and holding meetings after studying was adopted, and a set of necessary learning systems was established, so that it was generally possible to ensure two hours of learning every day, which not only changed the past phenomenon that cadres only asked others to learn and did not learn themselves, but also could discover problems through participation in learning and better lead the masses in production and learning, so that spare-time education could better serve production, combine with production, ensure production, and achieve a double harvest of production and learning. Therefore, this cadre study class has persisted from literacy to junior high school for five years and has always played a leading role in learning culture.

Original Soldiers, Original Generals, Original Team; Teachers and Students All Upgrade

After a mass learning upsurge was formed, the biggest difficulty we encountered was the issue of teachers. In recent years, our basic policy for teachers in spare-time schools has always been to follow the policy of "teaching each other by the people" and mobilizing peasants to teach themselves. When popularizing spare-time junior high schools, the Xiufeng Brigade Spare-time School had a big problem with teachers. Among the twenty-one people's teachers in the whole brigade, only one had studied in the first year of junior high school, two had graduated from elementary school, and the rest had started from literacy. Many people's teachers had a fear of difficulty when they heard that they were going to teach junior high school. Some people thought that they had never even crossed the threshold of junior high school, "How can I be a junior high school teacher?" Teaching senior primary school is still reluctantly coping, and teaching junior high school is forcing a duck onto a shelf." What to do? Should we reach out for help? No. The Party branch criticized the dependent idea of demanding that higher authorities send more high school graduates, resolutely implemented the self-reliance policy of "teaching each other by the people, using local materials, and using those who are capable as teachers," adopted the revolutionary method of "original soldiers, original generals, original team; teachers and students all upgrade," and used various forms to train and improve spare-time school teachers. Such as: 1. Hold Sunday teacher training classes. This is a method that combines short-term plans with long-term plans. Teachers are students in the morning, training in junior high school Chinese, physics, algebra, and geometry to prepare for opening classes; they are teachers in the afternoon. Collective lesson preparation, collective research of the same class and the same progress, determine the teaching objectives, solve the difficult problems in the teaching materials and teaching methods, and teach in the evening. 2. Hold rotating training classes. Each class and group is equipped with a double set of teachers for rotating training. In the first half of the month, a set of teachers and counselors are transferred to training. The second set of teachers and counselors persist in teaching in the classes and groups, and the two sides exchange in the second half of the month. In this way, teaching will not be interrupted, and the cultural level of teachers can be continuously improved, and the quality of teaching can be improved. 3. Hold teaching transmission stations. Middle school teachers sent by the county come to the station once a week to teach demonstrations, organize symposiums to exchange experiences, and solve difficult problems in teaching. 4. Use the strong to lead the weak, and the old to lead the new, and adopt the method of backbone teachers leading general teachers, and general teachers leading counselors to gradually train, improve, and strengthen the team of people's teachers. In addition, the brigade also selects excellent teachers to go to the worker-peasant normal schools run by the county and commune for further study, and absorbs people's teachers to participate in certain cadre meetings to improve their political level.

The Combination of Politics, Culture, and Technology

In recent years, according to the requirements of production development, we have implemented the combination of politics, culture, and technology; the combination of production, teaching, and scientific research. Taking spare-time schools as the position, we have conducted political and ideological education and production technology education among cadres and the masses in a planned way, which has not only rapidly improved the cultural level of peasants, but also greatly improved the socialist and communist consciousness of peasants. All levels of spare-time schools have adopted unified political study, separate class cultural study, and separate professional technical study. Each class has organized a philosophy research group and a scientific and technological research group according to professional specialties. In addition to the Party branch secretary and political instructors explaining the central work and the Party's various policies, the content of political education also includes studying Mao Zedong's works. In the past two years, they have studied Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction," "On Practice," and "Peasant Philosophy," which has effectively eliminated superstition and improved consciousness. In the past, some people believed that Xiufeng Brigade had high mountains, cold water, and poor soil, and it was impossible to increase production more. They had "conditionalism," "difficulties," and "pessimism" about the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production. Through study, cadres and the masses combined with their ideological reality for discussion and debate, and generally understood that "there is only downstream thinking, no downstream fields." As long as they give full play to their enthusiasm, natural conditions can be transformed. So, they liberated their minds, established the belief in overcoming nature, transformed fields, and won the victory of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production. Through the study of basic philosophy courses, cadres have been able to initially use the viewpoint of "On Contradiction" to correctly solve and handle problems in their work.

One book in the school, one field outside the school, and the combination of "book" and "field," using "field" to enrich "book" and "book" to guide "field," is another important content of the combination of politics, culture, and technology in Xiufeng Brigade Spare-time School. At present, all spare-time schools in the brigade have generally reached one class, one factory (farm). For example, the cadre class has established an agricultural experimental farm, the youth class has established a fertilizer factory, and the women's study group has established a "March 8" pig farm. According to the method of learning, doing, and experimenting, book knowledge is better combined with practice, the understanding of theory is deepened, and the knowledge that has been obtained is consolidated and expanded. For example, after the students studied the "Agricultural Technology" magazine, they understood that cold water fields have short water sources and low water temperatures. So, according to the experience of learning, they opened a rotary ditch around the field, extended the length of the irrigation canal, and applied more organic fertilizer to increase the water temperature. Another example is that tomatoes are the main crop of Xiufeng Brigade, and spare-time schools have used tomatoes as the main project for research. Through the study of technical courses, students have learned advanced methods such as improving soil, greenhouse seedling cultivation, pest and disease control, and deep plowing, large ridges, close planting, and multiple fertilization, which has rapidly increased tomato production. Soon, these advanced cultivation methods were quickly promoted by the spare-time school to the entire brigade. In addition, spare-time schools have also established seven scientific and technological research groups, such as agriculture, fruit trees, tea industry, animal husbandry, horticulture, fertilizer, and subscribed to a large number of popular science magazines, such as "Popular Science" and "Agricultural Technology," to carry out scientific research activities. The entire brigade has conducted dozens of new experiments and technological innovations. Zhou Bangyuan, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch, has mastered some cultural and scientific knowledge, has learned to extract nitrogen from tobacco, and manufacture chemical fertilizers and other granular fertilizers, and is known by the masses as a soil fertilizer expert. 社员Wang Xiaopai cultivated a "Tomato King" weighing 63 and a half catties according to the greenhouse seedling cultivation and rational fertilization methods introduced in the book. Most of the land in Xiufeng Brigade was originally yellow mud, and the soil was very thin and called "dead soil." After the members learned soil science from the book and understood that the structure of yellow mud soil is not good and cannot retain fertilizer and water, they used methods such as returning straw to the field in the experimental field to improve the soil, and then vigorously promoted it, turning more than 1,000 mu of yellow mud fields into fertile and high-yield fields. In the current technical innovation and technical revolution movement, spare-time schools have become the positions for technical innovation, and teachers and students have become the backbone of the technical revolution. Under the leadership of the brigade's technical revolution committee, after only six nights of intense efforts, they created and transformed 25 kinds of agricultural tools, 534 pieces, such as Zhuo Kongjian, a student in the third volume of junior high school, created a field water turbine to drive threshing machines, potato cutting machines, and manure screening machines, which improved efficiency by four to six times based on the principle of water turbine.

The Cultural Revolution Promotes the Upsurge of Production

The organized people of Xiufeng have improved their cultural and scientific level through learning, which has powerfully promoted production. In recent years, the grain production of our Xiufeng Brigade has increased year by year. The total output in 1958 increased by nearly two times compared with 1949, and increased by 35% in 1959 compared with 1958. The average yield of sweet potatoes per mu was 8,000 catties, setting a record for large-scale high yield in mountainous areas. Industry has also gone from nothing to more than ten factories, and the people's living standards have improved year by year. In 1960, they worked harder. The area of early rice, sweet potatoes, and soybeans will be expanded three to five times compared with last year, and new agricultural tools will be used more universally. The cultural revolution has enabled new-type peasants who use both hands and brains to grow up in batches, and has created conditions for the intellectualization of workers and peasants and the gradual elimination of the difference between mental and physical labor. According to incomplete statistics, among the large number of construction talents trained in recent years, in addition to the 26 cadres, 84 various technicians, and 5 cultural soldiers who have been transported to various parts of the country and the province, a whole set of talents has also been trained for the brigade, such as electricians, forestry, animal husbandry, horticulture, fertilizers, tea industry, fruit trees, and teachers, instructors, and broadcasters, a total of 49 people. Not long ago, the people of Xiufeng Brigade, together with engineers sent by the county, were responsible for surveying, designing, measuring, setting lines, and excavating earthwork for the construction of a 9-kilometer-long highway and a 5-kilometer-long board car road, and the road was opened to traffic after only seven days of hard work. At the end of last year, under the guidance of technicians, we built a 12-kilowatt hydroelectric power station in the village, which brought electric lights to the mountain valley for the first time. Due to the improvement of cultural level, people's spiritual outlook has also undergone tremendous changes. The atmosphere of working without conditions and without regard to remuneration is growing rapidly, the atmosphere of learning is very strong, and the library is often crowded with people. Poetry journals and wall newspapers are hung all over the streets, and the brigade's wired broadcast broadcasts news and songs from the capital of the motherland - Beijing and Fuzhou and other places in the morning and evening. Farmers' amateur theater troupes and sports teams often hold practice and performances. The streets are swept clean, and the habit of loving hygiene has been formed among the masses. Various infectious diseases have been basically eliminated, and the barren and backward mountainous area has become a cultural township.

Although our brigade spare-time school work has achieved some results in recent years, this cannot meet the needs of socialist construction. We must vigorously implement the spirit of this conference, hold high the red flag of the cultural revolution, run the spare-time school better, train a contingent of working-class intellectuals who are both red and expert at the fastest speed, develop production at high speed, strive to further reduce the differences between workers and peasants, urban and rural areas, and physical and mental labor, and move towards our ultimate goal of struggle - the road of communism.

    高举文化革命红旗向工农群众知识化迈进
    福建省古田县秀峰大队业余学校代表　王锦娇
    我是福建省古田县大桥公社秀峰大队业余学校的副校长，也是学员。今天能够来到首都，出席这次大会，感到非常高兴。
    秀峰是一个偏僻的山村，村落分散，全队有十九个自然村，最远的相距二十多里，近的也有二、三里。解放前，这里的群众生活十分穷困。那时，全乡的青壮年中，只有一个地主的儿子念过初中一年级，十一个富裕中农粗识一些字，其余全部是文盲。群众说：“有眼不明，写信要走十里求人”。
    解放后，在党的领导下，随着生产的发展，我们秀峰人民在文化上也翻了身。1951年办起冬学，1956年大搞扫盲运动，1957年7月就实现了基本无文盲乡，接着普及了业余高小，1958年办起了业余初中。现在，全大队的三百零八个青壮年中，有二百六十六人参加业余初中学习，其余四十二人在业余高小学习，普及了业余初中教育。全大队出现了二百零一户“初中之家”（全家青壮年都上业余初中学习）。党支部书记陈细灿同志，原来一字不识，现在已是初中二上班的学员，不仅学会写总结和工作报告，而且还写了“只有下游思想，没有下游田”等哲学论文。女乡长萧金香，过去七岁就替地主放牛，解放后，和我一起参加民校学习，经过几年顽强学习，去年考进了厦门大学工农预科，学习成绩很好，群众称她是女秀才。我从小也没有读过书，一字不识，1951年才参加业余学校学习，因为我家离学校比较远，每晚来回要跑九里多路，开头，我母亲不愿意让我去，说：“晚上有鬼，有老虎”，“妇女学习文化没有用”。我对母亲说：“鬼我从来没有看见过，那是迷信；妇女学文化和男的一样有用，现在男同志会干的事，我们妇女也会干，男的要学文化，我们妇女也要学文化。”于是，我说服了母亲。从1952年初到现在的八年半的时间里，除了外出开会和生病，我每晚都坚持到民校学习，不管风、雨、霜、雪有多么大，也从不间断。所以，现在我也跟上了业余初中班。人家为我计算了一下，说我几年来上民校所走的路，超过了二万五千里。
    生产高潮推动文化高潮
    解放之后，随着经济建设高潮的到来，我们大队出现了一个尖锐的矛盾，这就是社会主义经济制度和生产发展的需要与广大群众文化水平低许多人还是文盲的矛盾。毛主席说过：随着经济建设的高潮的到来，不可避免地将出现一个文化建设的高潮。“一穷二白”的秀峰大队在这方面表现得特别明显，土地改革，掀起了办冬学的热潮，农业合作化，掀起了扫盲和业余教育热潮；人民公社化，掀起了大办业余初中热潮。这是因为每个时期的政治、经济前进了，落后的文化跟不上，有了矛盾，就要解决。一个矛盾解决了，又产生了一个新的矛盾，再解决，再发生，这就形成秀峰大队三次办学高潮的特点。
    1952年秀峰乡进行了土地改革，消灭了几千年来的封建剥削，生产关系改变了，生产力发展了，群众中就产生了革文化落后命，使自己成为真正的文化主人的要求，在大生产形势的推动下，掀起了第一次学文化的高潮。
    1955年农业合作化高潮到来后，生产规模扩大了，经营部门多了，特别感到劳力不足，需要改进技术，生产上和生活上处处都需要文化；合作化要记账，但会记账的是地主，政治上不可靠，而可靠的又不会记账；合作社推广技术，社员不会读书看报，好经验学不到，买来的喷雾器无人使用，用一次“六六六”粉要跑到七、八里外请人代装，先进技术不容易推广；干部听上级报告，不会记笔记，传达凭脑记，文件看不懂，工作很难做；没有文化，接生推不开，科学知识难普及，文娱活动难开展；建设社会主义和落后的文化发生尖锐的矛盾。毛主席指出：“我国现在文盲这样多，而社会主义的建设又不能等到消灭了文盲以后才去开始进行……这个严重的问题必须在农业合作化的过程中加以解决，也只有在农业合作化的过程中才能解决。”毛主席的话给农村扫盲指出了方向。因此，乡中在开展合作化高潮中也掀起了扫盲高潮，出现了白天千军万马闹生产，夜晚一片读书声的热潮。知山村妇女识字小组九人，共有小孩二十六个，平均每人差不多有三个小孩，在业余学校女学员帮助下仍坚持学习。下雨天，四、五里外的企碓村群众还把棉被带去，在民校里睡觉，第二天麻麻亮就回家，这样只用两年多的时间，就扫除了青壮年文盲，又用不到两年时间，攻下了业余高小关，基本普及了业余初等教育。
    1958年人民公社化后，生产内容越来越丰富，技术越来越复杂，公社除了农、林、副、牧、渔全面发展外，还要办工业，公社需要培养一批自己的知识分子、技术人员和管理干部，如水电站工人，锻工、电工、播音员、饲养员、农业技术员。人民公社化、大跃进、技术革命的新形势又要求掀起第三次学习高潮，全大队85％以上的业余高小班毕业的学员全部转入业余初中班学习。
    以不断革命思想学文化
    在办学过程中，我们秀峰大队业余学校不是没有遇到困难和思想障碍的。我们在党支部领导下始终坚持政治挂帅，坚持不断革命精神，使扫除文盲、普及高小后，一鼓作气进入初中，把文化革命红旗高高举起。在办学初期，有些干部对农民迫切要求文化翻身抱着漠不关心的态度，把学习和生产完全对立起来，说：“农民是拿锄头的，不需要文化”，“学文化就会影响生产”，因此不去积极领导群众学习，有的甚至还加以阻挠，造成业余学校时办时停的现象。党支部分析了当时业余学校办不好的原因，主要是领导抓的不紧，干部思想问题没有解决。因此，就在干部中算文化落后账的害处，批判错误思想，统一了认识，扫盲工作很快就健康地开展起来。现在发展与巩固业余教育，普及业余初中的过程中，又碰到不少思想障碍。如业余高小班转入初中班时出现了两种思想情况：一是松劲歇气思想，如有些青壮年认为“山沟里种田识点字就够用了”，有些中年人认为“年纪大了，会看书、看报、记工算账就行了，上初中是孩子的事”，有些妇女说：“操锅杓不需要加减乘除，洗锅台用不了初中生，有了高小水平差不多了。”党支部了解这种情况，提出“高举文化革命红旗，大破够用论，乘胜前进，向初中进军”的口号，总结了扫盲和组织高小班学习经验，召开党、团支部大会和业余学校学员大会，进行政治思想教育，表扬和奖励一批积极学员和热心办学的积极分子。同时组织大会鸣放辩论，小组座谈，个别动员教育。在辩论会上大家用回忆过去，看现在，望将来的办法，解决了“现在所学的文化能不能适应社会主义建设需要？”“要实现农业的机械化、水利化、电气化，要不要继续学下去？”等思想问题。另一种思想问题是强调“正规”，如在高小转入初中时进行了一次测验编班，发现大多数学员语文程度已达到高小毕业水平，但数学程度却较差，这时，有些人怀疑初中“办早了”，“不像样”，说“那有读初中语文、小学算术的中学”，主张取消初中小组，要并大班。这种所谓“正规”思想的实质是不要业余教育，妨碍业余教育的迅速提高。党支部认为根据群众的要求和现有文化状况，按语文程度编初中班，先重点学习初中语文，然后再逐步提高数学和自然科学知识，这样做，既满足了群众的要求，加速培养人材，又结合当前农村的实际情况，而且也是农村业余教育发展过程中的正常现象，是符合边普及边提高，在普及的同时大抓提高的精神的。因此，依靠了广大群众驳斥了这种论调，把初中班坚决办起来。
    干部“两抓，两参，两带头”
    在开展群众性学习运动中，党支部注意加强领导，支部书记亲自挂帅，实行全党全民办学。从书记、支委到一般干部，都做到“两抓”，“两参”，“两带头”，即一手抓生产，一手抓学习；参加生产，带头生产；参加学习，带头学习，并采取书记全面管，支委分片，党员干部包队，党团员包组包人等包干负责的办法，做到一套人马，两个任务，生产学习领导“一元化”，层层有人抓，一竿子到底。为了加强对业余教育的领导，党团支部还搞了“试验田”，如党支部办了干部学习班；共青团支部办了青年学习班；妇联办了妇女学习小组。干部班开始学时，问题很多，特别是许多干部工作地区分散，工作又忙，开会与学习经常发生矛盾。有的干部来到教室，还没有坐定，就被叫去开会了；有的则“身在教室，心想工作”，学习不能坚持，因而也影响群众学习的巩固。党支部发现这一情况后，认为干部是业余学校的主要对象，干部的政治、文化水平不高，与生产、工作搞得好坏有很大关系。干部忙，学文化虽有一定困难，但有很多有利条件，如学习的要求更为迫切，学用更为一致，政治水平比群众高等等。而且，干部学得好坏，又直接影响到群众的学习。因此，党支部下了决心，一定要把干部班办好，并作为领导学习的“试验田”。对工作、开会与学习的矛盾，采用先学习，后研究工作，先学习后开会的办法，并建立一套必要的学习制度，这样一般都能保证每天学习两小时，这样既改变了过去干部只叫别人学，自己不学的现象，同时还可以通过参加学习，发现问题，更好地领导群众生产和学习，使业余教育更好地服务生产、结合生产、保证生产，取得生产、学习双丰收。因此，这个干部学习班从扫盲到初中坚持五年，一直起学文化的带头作用。
    原兵原将原班底　教师学员齐升级
    群众学习高潮形成后，我们遇到最大的困难是师资问题。几年来我们业余学校师资的基本方针，始终是遵循着“以民教民”的方针，发动农民自己教自己。在普及业余初中时，秀峰大队业余学校师资是个很大问题，全大队二十一个民师中，只有一个读过初中一年，二个小学毕业，其余都是从扫盲起家的。不少民师听说要教初中产生畏难情绪。有的认为连初中门槛也没跨过，“怎样能当初中教师呢？”教高小还勉强招架，教初中是打鸭子上架”，怎么办呢？当伸手派吗？不能。党支部批判了主张要求上级增派高中毕业生等依赖思想，坚决贯彻“以民教民，就地取材，能者为师”的自力更生方针，采用“原兵原将原班底、教师学员齐升级”的革命办法，运用多种多样形式，培养提高业余学校教师。如：1、举办星期日教师进修班。这是短打算和长计划相结合的一种办法，教师上午当学生，进修初中语文、物理、代数、几何，为开课做好准备；下午当教师。集体备课，同班级同进度的集体研究，确定教学目的，解决教材中的难题和教学方法，晚上教学。2、举办轮训班。每班、组配备双套教师进行轮训。上半个月抽调甲套教师、辅导员进修训练。乙套教师、辅导员则在班、组坚持教学，下半月就互相对换。这样教学不会中断，又能不断提高教师文化水平，提高教学质量。3、举办教学传授站。由县派中学教师每星期来站传授一次，进行示范教学，组织座谈交流经验，解决教学中的疑难问题。4、以强带弱，以老带新，采取骨干教师带一般教师，一般教师带辅导员的办法，逐步培养提高壮大民师队伍。此外，大队还选送优秀的教师到县、公社办的工农师范学校进修学习，吸收民师参加某些干部会，以提高他们的政治水平。
    政治、文化、技术三结合
    几年来我们根据生产发展的要求，实行政治、文化、技术三结合；生产、教学、科学研究相结合。以业余学校为阵地，有计划地在干部群众中进行政治思想教育与生产技术教育，既迅速地提高了农民文化水平，又大大提高了农民的社会主义和共产主义觉悟，各级业余学校都采取统一学政治、分班学文化、分业学技术。每个班级都组织哲学研究小组，并按专业组织科学技术研究小组。政治教育内容除由党支部书记和政治教员讲解中心工作和党的各项政策外，还学习毛泽东著作。两年来已学习了毛主席“矛盾论”、“实践论”以及“农民哲学”，有效地破除了迷信，提高了觉悟。过去有些人认为秀峰大队山高水冷土质贫瘠，不可能更多增产，对农业生产大跃进抱“条件论”“困难论”和“悲观论”。通过学习，干部群众联系思想实际进行讨论辩论，普遍懂得了“只有下游思想，没有下游田”，只要充分发挥积极性，自然条件是可以改造的。于是解放了思想，树立战胜自然的信念，改造田地，赢得了农业生产大跃进的胜利。通过哲学基础课的学习，干部已能初步运用“矛盾论”的观点正确解决与处理工作中的问题。
    校内一本书，校外一丘田，“书、田”相结合，以“田”充实“书”，以“书”指导“田”，是秀峰大队业余学校政治、文化、技术三结合的另一重要内容。目前全大队各个业余学校普遍达到一班一厂（场）。如干部班设立了农业试验场，青年班设立了化肥厂，妇女学习小组设立了“三八”养猪场。根据边学边做边试验的办法，书本知识与实践更好地结合，加深了对理论的理解，又巩固和扩大了已得的知识。如学员学习了“农业技术”杂志后，懂得了冷水田是水源短、水温低，于是根据学习的经验，在田周围开回旋沟，延长水渠长度，并多下有机肥，增加了水温。又如蕃茄是秀峰大队的主要作物，业余学校把蕃茄作为主要项目进行研究。通过技术课的学习，学员学会了改良土壤、温床育苗、病虫害防治和深耕、大畦、密植、多施肥等先进方法，使蕃茄产量迅速提高。不久，这些先进栽培方法便很快由业余学校推广到全队。此外，业余学校还成立了农业、果树、茶业、畜牧业等七个科学技术研究小组，并订阅了大批的科学通俗杂志，如“大众科学”、“农业技术”等，展开科学研究活动。全队进行了几十项新试验和技术革新。共青团支部书记周邦远，由于掌握了一些文化科学知识，已学会烟中取氮、制造化学肥料及其他颗粒肥料，被群众称为土化肥家。社员王孝排根据书上介绍的温床育苗和合理施肥办法，培育出一棵重达六十三斤半的“蕃茄王”。秀峰大队原来大部分土地都是黄泥土，土质很瘦叫做“死土”。社员从书本上学了土壤学，懂得黄泥土结构不好，不能保肥保水的道理后，就在试验田中用稻草回田等办法改良土壤，接着大力推广，使一千多亩的黄泥田变成肥沃的丰产田。在当前技术革新和技术革命运动中业余学校成为技术革新的阵地，师生成为技术革命的骨干，在大队技术革命委员的领导下，仅仅经过六个晚上的突击，创造和改造了农具二十五种，五百三十四件，如初中三册班学员卓孔坚根据水轮机的原理，创造田头水轮机带动打谷机、切薯机和筛粪机等，提高工效四到六倍。
    文化革命促进了生产高潮
    组织起来的秀峰人民，通过学习提高了文化科学水平，有力地促进了生产。几年来，我们秀峰大队的粮食连年增产，1958年总产量比1949年增长近二倍，1959年又比1958年增长35％；地瓜平均亩产八千斤，创山区大面积高产纪录。工业也从一无所有最后到十多个厂，群众生活水平一年比一年提高。1960年，他们干劲更大，早稻、地瓜、黄豆面积将比去年扩大三倍到五倍，新式农具将更普遍地采用。文化革命使手脑并用的新型农民成批成长，并为工农群众知识化和逐步消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别创造了条件。据不完全统计，几年来培养出大批的建设人才中，除输送到全国和本省各地干部二十六人、各种技工八十四人、文化兵五人外，还为本大队培养了一整套的人才，如电工、林业、畜牧、园艺、肥料、茶业、果树和教师、教养员、播音员等四十九名。不久以前，秀峰大队修建一条长达九公里的公路和五公里长的板车路，秀峰人民就和县里派来的工程师一起担负勘察、设计、测量、定线和开挖土方工作，只奋战七天就通车了。去年底我们在技术人员的指导下在村里建立一座十二瓩的水力发电站，使山沟里第一次有了电灯。由于文化水平的提高，人们的精神面貌也起了巨大的变化。劳动不讲条件、不计报酬的风气正在迅速成长，学习风气十分浓厚，图书馆里经常挤满了人。诗刊、墙报挂满街头，大队的有线广播早上和傍晚都播送祖国首都——北京和福州等地的新闻和歌曲。农民业余剧团和体育队经常举行练习和表演。街头街尾打扫得干干净净，热爱卫生的习惯已在群众中形成。各种传染病已经基本消灭，贫瘠、落后的山区已经变成为文化之乡了。
    几年来我们大队业余学校工作，虽然获得了一些成绩，但这还不能满足社会主义建设的需要。我们一定要把这次大会的精神，强有力地贯彻下去，高举文化革命红旗，把业余学校办得更好，以最快的速度培养出一支又红又专的工人阶级知识分子队伍，高速度地发展生产，为进一步缩小工农差别、城乡差别以及体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别而努力，并朝着我们最终的奋斗目标——共产主义的道路迈进。
