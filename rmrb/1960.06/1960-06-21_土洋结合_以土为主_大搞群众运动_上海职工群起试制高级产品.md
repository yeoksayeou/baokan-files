Combining Indigenous and Foreign Methods, Emphasizing Indigenous Methods, and Launching a Mass Movement
Shanghai Workers Rally to Trial-Produce Advanced Products

(Our newspaper, Shanghai, 20th dispatch) The broad masses of workers on Shanghai's industrial front, since the beginning of this year, while further developing mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation on a large scale, have been fiercely attacking the manufacturing technology of "high-precision and cutting-edge" products using indigenous methods, and have achieved tremendous success.

At the end of last year, under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Shanghai's industrial production departments, in accordance with the new situation, made new plans for further developing advanced, precision, and cutting-edge products, so as to fully utilize the technical conditions of Shanghai's old industrial base and strive to produce high-precision and cutting-edge products urgently needed by the country in the shortest possible time, filling the gaps in science and technology. At the beginning of this year, all walks of life immediately took action to trial-produce advanced products. Wang Linhe, a young worker at the Huguang Scientific Instrument Factory, after 371 arduous experiments, produced 10,000-volt and 50,000-volt high-voltage bridges, a clear banner for the city's indigenous methods of tackling high-precision and cutting-edge technology. His deeds had a great impact throughout the city, and workers learned from him one after another, and many Wang Linhe-style figures and Huguang-style factories emerged. A mass movement of starting with indigenous methods and fiercely attacking high-precision and cutting-edge products quickly emerged throughout the city. Shanghai Instrument Factory and Huaqiu Instrument Factory, etc., quickly trial-produced hundreds of new products. The volume of many products is getting smaller and smaller, and the power is getting greater and greater. A high-pressure oil pump successfully trial-produced by the Shanghai Press Machine Factory weighs only one-thirtieth of the old product, but has the same power as the old product. In the past, Shanghai rarely produced electron tube products, but now, more than 100 types of electron tubes for various purposes have been trial-produced in one quarter.

In the process of tackling "high-precision and cutting-edge" technology, the masses' enterprising spirit is getting greater and greater, and their style is getting higher and higher. Even the Dingkang Instrument Wooden Shell Factory, which makes wooden boxes and shells for instrument factories, has also started to engage in the manufacture of high-precision and cutting-edge instrument products. The workers in this factory are all carpenters and painters who use axes, planes, and brushes, with an average age of about 40. However, they knew that the country urgently needed a large number of instruments and meters, so they were determined to learn trial production. They went to other factories during the day to learn the technology of manufacturing instruments and meters, and gathered together in the evening to collectively study the design and manufacture of new products. In less than a month, they actually successfully trial-produced more than ten kinds of high-precision and cutting-edge products.

Many practical experiences in Shanghai have proved that as long as we conscientiously implement the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, with indigenous methods as the mainstay, and extensively mobilize the masses and launch a mass movement, we can conquer high-precision and cutting-edge products in a faster, better, and more economical way. The Shanghai Tool Factory's use of indigenous methods to make 0.08 mm small drills and small reamers is a very typical example. These small drills and small reamers are only as thin as a strand of hair and are important cutting tools for manufacturing high-precision and cutting-edge instruments and meters. According to foreign methods, the manufacturing process requires a complete set of automated precision small machine tools; there must be constant temperature equipment to maintain a certain temperature in the room; the operating workshop must be located in a quiet area without vibration; and there must also be equipment to remove micro-dust, etc. However, the small tool section that undertook this task was located in the attic of the wire drawing workshop where the machine sound was rumbling, and none of the conditions were met. Some people were intimidated by these conditions and did not dare to hand over the task to the small tool section for a while. However, the workers in the small tool section actively created the necessary conditions for manufacturing small drills and small reamers with faster, better, and more economical indigenous methods. However, these small drills and small reamers were too small. During processing, they were either big-headed and thin-bodied, or the dimensions were not up to standard. Even if the hands and feet were a little heavy, the small drill and small reamer would fly away. Therefore, the workers, through repeated careful experiments, constantly changed the processing methods of grinding, grooving, and starting the cutting edge, and finally, in only four or five days, they successfully manufactured 0.08 mm small drills and small reamers.

Practice has also proved that only by adopting indigenous methods can a vigorous mass movement of trial-producing advanced products emerge. Adopting indigenous methods can mobilize the enthusiasm of all parties. It can not only mobilize the enthusiasm of people with high technical skills, but also mobilize the enthusiasm of people with low technical skills or even no technical skills. The Tongren Alloy Factory, which had relatively good products, once retreated to relying on a few people to use foreign methods to make alloys, so many important projects could not be carried out. This year, the leadership made an inspection of this and launched the masses to carry out large-scale production with indigenous methods, and quickly achieved results. The cadres of this factory realized: "Tackling high-precision and cutting-edge technology is like catching fish. Once a mass movement is launched, the net is spread wide and more fish are caught."

In order to further carry out the mass movement of tackling high-precision and cutting-edge products, under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, all industrial production departments and scientific research units in the city have organized cadres and technicians to go down to factories and workshops to summarize the experience gained in attacking cutting-edge technology with indigenous methods together with the workers, and to jointly study and trial-produce new high-precision and cutting-edge products; and they have also grasped the consolidation, popularization, and improvement of new products, new technologies, and new processes.

    土洋结合　以土为主　大搞群众运动
    上海职工群起试制高级产品
    本报上海20日电　上海工业战线上的广大职工，今年以来在进一步大搞机械化半机械化、自动化半
  自动化同时，用土办法猛攻“高精尖”产品的制造技术，获得巨大的成就。
    去年年底，上海市各工业生产部门在中共上海市委的领导下，根据新的形势，作出了进一步发展高级、精密、尖端产品的新规划，以便充分利用上海老工业基地的技术条件，争取在最短时期内，为国家生产迫切需要的高精尖产品，填补科学技术上的空白。今年一开始，各行各业就立即行动起来，试制高级产品。沪光科学仪器厂青年工人王林鹤，经过三百七十一次艰苦试验，制成了一万伏和五万伏高压电桥，是全市土办法攻高精尖的一面鲜明旗帜。他的事迹在全市发生很大影响，工人们纷纷向他学习，一时出现了许许多多王林鹤式的人物，沪光式的工厂。全市很快出现了一个土法上马，猛攻高精尖产品的群众运动。上海仪表厂和华球仪表厂等，很快试制出上百种新产品。许多产品体积越做越小，功率越做越大。上海压力机床厂试制成功的一台高压油泵，体重只有老产品的三十分之一，但功率却和老产品一样。过去，上海很少生产电子管产品，现在，一个季度就试制出一百多种各种用途的电子管。
    攻“高精尖”过程中，群众闯劲愈来愈大，风格愈来愈高，甚至一家为仪表厂造木箱木壳的鼎康仪表木壳厂，也搞起高精尖仪表产品的制造。这家工厂的工人都是拿斧头、刨子和刷帚的木工、漆工，年龄平均在四十岁左右。但他们知道国家迫切需要大量的仪器仪表，就决心学习试制。他们白天到外厂学习制造仪器仪表的技术，晚上在一起集体研究新产品的设计和制造，不到一个月时间，居然试制成功了十多种高精尖产品。
    上海的许多实践经验证明：只要认真地贯彻土洋结合、以土为主的方针，广泛地发动群众、大搞群众运动，就可以多快好省地攻下高精尖产品。上海工具厂用土办法制成零点零八毫米的小钻头和小铰刀，就是一个很典型的例子。这种小钻头和小铰刀，只有一根头发丝那样细，是制造高精尖仪器仪表重要的切削工具。按照洋办法，制造时要用全套自动化的精密小机床；要有恒温设备，使室内保持一定的温度；操作工场要设在没有震动的安静地带；还要有能够清除微尘的设备，等等。而承担这个任务的小刀具工段，是设在机声隆隆的拉丝车间的阁楼上，一个条件也不具备。有些人给这些条件吓住了，一时不敢把任务交给小刀具工段。小刀具工段的工人却用多快好省的土办法，积极创造了制造小钻头、小铰刀必须具备的条件。但是，这种小钻头和小铰刀实在太小了，加工时，不是头大身细，便是尺寸不合规格。甚至，手脚重一些，小钻头小铰刀就不知飞到哪里去了。于是，工人们通过一次再次的精心试验，不断地改变加工时磨光、开槽和起刃口等操作方法，终于，只用四、五天时间，就制成功零点零八毫米的小钻头和小铰刀。
    实践还证明：只有采用土办法，才能够出现轰轰烈烈的试制高级产品的群众运动。采用土办法可以调动各个方面的积极性，不但可以调动技术水平高的人们的积极性，而且可以调动技术水平低的甚至没有技术的人们的积极性。产品比较好的铜仁合金厂，有一时期曾退回到依靠少数人用洋法搞合金，因而不少重要项目搞不出来。今年，领导上对此作了检查，并发动群众用土办法大搞，很快又做出成绩来。这个厂的干部体会：“攻高精尖和捉鱼一样，一搞群众运动，网就撒得广，鱼就抓得多。”
    为了进一步开展群众性的攻高精尖产品运动，在中共上海市委领导下，全市各工业生产部门和科学研究单位，纷纷组织了干部和技术人员下厂、下车间，与工人群众一同总结用土办法攻尖端中得来的经验，一同研究试制新的高精尖产品；并且抓紧了新产品、新工艺、新技术的巩固、推广、提高工作。
