    Voluntarily Working in a Backward Team
    The Guihua Production Team of our commune used to be a backward team, known as the "old tail-end team." Many cadres were unwilling to work in this team, but Jin Zizhong, the security officer of the brigade, voluntarily requested to work in the Guihua Team. In January of this year, the brigade Party General Branch approved Jin Zizhong's application and decided to appoint him as the Party Branch Secretary of the Guihua Team.
    After Jin Zizhong moved his luggage to the Guihua Team, he immediately found five people, including poor peasant member Zhu Boting, to discuss the matter of accumulating fertilizer and decided to start carrying mud the next morning. The next morning, the commune members came to the lotus pond, but because of the cold weather, many were unwilling to go down into the pond. At this time, Jin Zizhong took off his clothes and was the first to jump into the pond, and the commune members followed suit. Jin Zizhong dug mud and carried mud, working harder than anyone else. That day, his work efficiency reached five cubic meters, one or two times higher than usual. He performed equally well on the second and third days. Many commune members praised him, saying, "Secretary Jin is truly a good hand at work." Because Jin Zizhong could eat, live, and work with the commune members, his relationship with them became closer and closer, and all kinds of work became more and more outstanding. After five months, the backward state of this team changed. At a recent appraisal meeting of the brigade, the Guihua Production Team won red flags in production, livelihood, and branch work.

    自愿到落后队工作
    我们公社的桂花生产队，以前是个落后队，被人们称为“老尾巴队”。有不少干部不愿到这个队去工作，可是大队的治安员金子仲同志，却自动要求到桂花队去工作。今年1月，大队党总支批准了金子仲的申请，决定他到桂花队去担任党的分支部书记。
    金子仲将行李搬到桂花队以后，当晚就找到贫农社员朱伯廷等五人，商量积肥的事，决定第二天清早就开始挑泥巴。第二天早晨，社员们来到藕塘边，由于天冷，许多人不愿下塘。这时，金子仲脱去衣服，第一个跳下塘，社员们也就跟着跳下塘去。金子仲一会儿挖泥，一会儿挑泥，干得比谁都凶，这一天他的工效达到五方，比平常高一、两倍。第二天、第三天同样干得很出色。不少社员夸奖说：“金支书真是个干活的好把手。”由于金子仲能够和社员同吃同住同劳动，跟社员的关系就越来越密切，各种工作也越来越出色。五个月以后，这个队的落后面貌就改变了。在最近大队的一次评比会上，桂花生产队在生产、生活、支部工作方面都得了红旗。
