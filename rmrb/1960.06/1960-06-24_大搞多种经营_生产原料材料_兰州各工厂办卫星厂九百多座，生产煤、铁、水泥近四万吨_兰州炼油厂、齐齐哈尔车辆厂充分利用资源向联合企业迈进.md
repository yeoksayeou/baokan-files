    Vigorously Develop Diversified Operations to Produce Raw Materials
    Lanzhou Factories Establish Over 900 Satellite Factories, Producing Nearly 40,000 Tons of Coal, Iron, and Cement
    Lanzhou Refinery and Qiqihar Rolling Stock Plant Fully Utilize Resources to Move Towards Joint Enterprises
    (Our newspaper's report from Lanzhou on June 23rd) Factories and enterprises in Lanzhou are expanding sources of raw materials through self-reliance, setting off a mass movement of diversified operations in all sectors. According to incomplete statistics, by the end of May, the city had built and put into production 963 satellite factories. These factories produced 30,970 tons of coal, 740 tons of pig iron, 7,942 tons of cement, and 76,429,000 bricks. Employees in the petroleum and chemical industry system have also successfully trial-produced 38 new products.
    The main objective of these satellite factories is to focus on the production of raw materials and the comprehensive utilization of materials. The insufficient supply of raw materials is a new problem encountered under the unprecedentedly good situation on Lanzhou's industrial front this year. In particular, with the general improvement of mechanization and automation, the demand for raw materials is even greater. Under the leadership of the Lanzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Party committees at all levels, based on different situations and closely integrated with production needs, have focused on the production of raw materials. The No. 1 and No. 2 companies of the Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering have adopted the method of building factories on construction sites and using local materials. No. 1 Company has built nine material factories, producing batches of mineral wool, shavings, oil felt paper, calcium chloride, silicate, cement, lime, and over 20 other kinds of building materials, basically ensuring normal construction. In order to adapt the supply of raw materials to the large-scale infrastructure construction tasks, No. 2 Company also collaborated with the Yaogou Xinsheng Coal Mine in Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture to expand a brick and tile factory with an annual output of over 10 million bricks, and built a new cement factory with an annual output of 10,000 tons and a larger lime factory, as the company's main building materials production base, so that the production of raw materials is regularized. The construction tasks undertaken by the Third Engineering Bureau this year have increased by more than 30% compared with last year. Because the whole bureau focused on the production of raw materials, it has completed half of the annual plan 33 days ahead of schedule. Factories and enterprises in Xigu District of Lanzhou City have also effectively solved the difficulty of insufficient supply of raw materials by vigorously promoting comprehensive utilization. The 69 satellite factories set up in this district use side materials, waste materials, waste residue, and waste liquid from large factories as raw materials to produce over 30 kinds of products, such as iron, welding rods, and clock oil, which has promoted the rapid development of industrial production in the district. As of mid-May, the district's total industrial output value had completed 50.7% of the annual state plan. In the process of setting up satellite factories in a big way, many factories and enterprises have established specialized leading organizations, comprehensively planned, and carried out operations in stages and batches. They have also adopted the method of "three fixings" (fixing factory buildings, fixing equipment, fixing personnel) and "six sides" (planning, acting, building, producing, consolidating, and improving simultaneously), building one and implementing one, which has played a great role in promoting production.
    Taking one industry as the main focus and engaging in diversified operations, regarding setting up satellite factories as "experimental fields," and gradually developing large enterprises towards joint enterprises, is another characteristic of Lanzhou's large-scale establishment of satellite factories. The Lanzhou General Machinery Factory mainly produces oil pumping units, well washing machines, well workover machines, cement trucks, and other oil extraction equipment. In order to combine with production needs and gradually develop towards a joint enterprise, this factory has formulated a plan to build 28 new satellite factories this year. In addition to contracting to build eight farm tool repair factories for the Tianshui area to support agricultural technological transformation, the remaining 20 satellite factories for iron smelting, steel making, steel rolling, refractory materials, building materials, and auxiliary materials are to serve the factory's expanded reproduction and capital construction. In order to realize this plan as soon as possible, the factory assigned the construction and expansion tasks of these satellite factories to various functional departments and workshops as "experimental fields," and assigned them to be built by individual departments. The Party committee provided comprehensive leadership, and cadres at all levels took the lead, went deep into reality, summarized experience, and promptly solved specific problems, which achieved good results. At present, ten satellite factories and workshops, including bearings, coking, welding rods, and cement, have been built and put into production, with an output value of over 1.03 million yuan in May alone. Other main raw materials, materials, and fuels will also be produced and supplied by the factory on a larger scale, laying the foundation for the factory to further develop into a joint enterprise.
    (Our newspaper's report from Lanzhou on June 23rd) The Lanzhou Refinery is vigorously developing diversified operations, setting up a complete set of mechanical industry and instrument manufacturing industry, equipping itself. At present, the entire factory has formed nine systems and built eight production bases with large installations as the core, making the modern petroleum enterprise develop into a joint enterprise.
    Since completing the first phase of its construction project in 1958, the Lanzhou Refinery, in order to accelerate the second phase of expansion, relied on its own efforts to manufacture parts and equipment, transforming the instrument room and machine repair shop, which were originally only responsible for maintenance and repair, into instrument factories and machine factories that engaged in both maintenance and manufacturing. Subsequently, on this basis, the foundry workshop was expanded, and a complete mechanical equipment and instrument manufacturing system including forging, casting, heat treatment, steel structure processing, metal processing, and metal casting was built.
    In terms of production, the factory, adhering to the principle of comprehensive utilization, diversified operations, and multi-functional factories, launched a mass movement, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and setting up satellite factories in a big way. Now, they have established more than 30 satellite factories, such as sulfurized oil, isopropylbenzene oxidation, various additives, paraffin oxidation, alcohols, and ferrous sulfate. These factories surround the main production installations and use by-products, waste gas, and wastewater from production for processing, not only producing various fuel oils, lubricating oils, and other petroleum products, but also producing 60 to 70 kinds of valuable chemical products. On the basis of this mass-based large-scale establishment of satellite factories, the factory conducted comprehensive planning based on the principle of maximizing the utilization of resources, increasing output value, and increasing varieties. Based on the nature and characteristics of each production installation, new processes and new technologies were widely adopted, thus forming nine systems throughout the factory, including various additives, high-temperature lubricating oil, low-freezing-point lubricating oil, high-grade alcohol, solvents, comprehensive utilization of gases, comprehensive utilization of paraffin, comprehensive utilization of acid slag and alkali slag, and comprehensive utilization of comprehensive utilization; and developed into eight production bases on the basis of the original production workshops. This has tightly combined the petroleum industry and the chemical industry, making them mutually utilize and promote each other, forming a comprehensive petroleum and chemical production enterprise.
    (Our dispatch) Guided by the principle of "taking one industry as the main focus and engaging in diversified operations," the Qiqihar Rolling Stock Plant is developing towards a joint enterprise.
    With the development of the national transportation industry, the factory's output of freight cars has surged, and the demand for raw materials, materials, fuel, and auxiliary materials has increased. In order to ensure the production of freight cars, the factory's Party committee actively mobilized and organized the vast number of employees, proceeding from production needs, taking vehicle production as the leading factor, and developing iron and steel materials as the center, to vigorously develop diversified operations and comprehensive utilization of raw materials, and establish raw material bases. In a very short period of time, 53 small factories were built, producing a large number of castings, pig iron, coke, cement, refractory materials, water glass, nodular cast iron machines, sand mixing machines, molding machines, and other products. Hydrochloric acid bricks and hollow floor slabs were also made using fly ash, slag, and waste sand; and light diesel oil, heavy diesel oil, asphalt, and other products were extracted from coal tar from the gas station. This not only ensured the completion of the factory's main product—freight car production tasks—but also opened up broad avenues for gradually developing into a joint enterprise.
    In order to set up more satellite factories as soon as possible, the factory's Party committee adopted the method of assigning tasks, setting deadlines, and implementing contract construction, contract production, contract management, and contract life for each unit. Therefore, from the department to the workshop, a climax of large-scale establishment of satellite factories and diversified operations was quickly set off. In just two months, the entire factory produced 646 tons of castings, 1,485 tons of coke, 53 motors, as well as more than 50 kinds of products such as water glass and forgings, which strongly guaranteed the completion of the factory's main product—freight car production plan.
    In vigorously promoting diversified operations and comprehensive utilization, the factory implemented the principle of proceeding from production, using whatever is needed, producing whatever is lacking, utilizing whatever is available, and doing whatever can be done, grasping both the key points and developing in an all-round way. In the past, most of the cast steel parts and cast iron parts for assembling freight cars in this factory were supplied from other places. In 1958, the production tasks of various brother factories increased greatly, and they could not continue to supply. They drew a few veteran workers as technical guidance, mobilized family members of employees to participate in labor, and built a satellite factory with an annual output of 5,000 tons of cast iron, which solved the supply problem of castings.
    Recently, according to the instructions of the provincial and municipal Party committees, the factory's Party committee decided to push the mass movement of diversified operations and comprehensive utilization to a new climax, work hard and diligently on the existing basis, and strive to develop the factory into a joint enterprise with five major production bases for vehicles, iron and steel, chemical fuel, building refractory materials, and non-staple foods in a not-too-long period of time.

    大搞多种经营　生产原料材料
    兰州各工厂办卫星厂九百多座，生产煤、铁、水泥近四万吨
    兰州炼油厂、齐齐哈尔车辆厂充分利用资源向联合企业迈进
    本报兰州23日电　兰州市各工厂企业自力更生，扩大原料材料来源，掀起了一个行行业业大搞多种经营的群众运动。据不完全统计，到5月底止，全市建成并投入生产的卫星厂达九百六十三个，这批工厂生产了煤炭三万零九百七十吨、生铁七百四十吨、水泥七千九百四十二吨、砖七万六千四百二十九万块。石油化工系统职工，还试制成功三十八种新产品。
    大抓原材料生产，大搞物资综合利用，是这批卫星厂的主攻目标。原材料供应赶不上需要，是今年兰州市工业战线上空前良好的形势下碰到的新问题。特别是随着机械化、自动化程度的普遍提高，对原材料的需要量就更大。在中共兰州市委的领导下，各级党委根据不同情况，紧密结合生产需要，狠抓原材料生产。建筑工程部第三工程局一、二公司采取工地建厂、就地取材的办法，一公司已建成九个材料厂，成批生产矿碴棉、刨花板、油毡纸、氯化钙、矽酸盐、水泥、石灰等二十多种建筑材料，基本上保证了正常施工。为了使原材料的供应与大规模的基建任务相适应，二公司还和临夏回族自治州窑沟新生煤矿协作，扩建了一个年产红砖一千万块以上的砖瓦厂，新建年产一万吨的水泥厂和规模较大的石灰厂各一座，作为公司主要建筑材料生产基地，使原材料生产走上经常化。第三工程局今年所承担的建筑任务比去年增长30％以上，由于全局大抓原材料生产，已提前三十三天完成了年计划的一半。兰州市西固区各工厂企业，大搞综合利用，也有效的解决了原材料供应不足的困难。这个区办起的六十九个卫星工厂，利用大厂的边材废料、废渣、废液作原料，生产出铁、电焊条、钟表油等三十多种产品，推动了全区工业生产的迅速发展。截至5月中旬，全区工业总产值已完成全年国家计划的50．7％。在大办卫星厂中，许多工厂企业成立了专门的领导机构，全面规划，分期、分批作战。并采取“三定”（定厂房、定设备、定人员）、“六边”（边规划、边行动、边建厂、边生产、边巩固、边提高）的办法，建一个落实一个，对促进生产起了很大作用。
    一业为主，多种经营，把办卫星厂作为“试验田”，使大型企业逐步向联合企业方向发展，是兰州市大办卫星厂的另一个特色。兰州通用机器厂主要是生产抽油机、洗井机、通井机、水泥车等采油设备的工厂。为了结合生产需要，逐步向联合性企业发展，今年这个厂制订了新建二十八个卫星厂的规划。其中除给天水专区包建八个农具修理厂，支援农业技术改造外，其余炼铁、炼钢、轧钢、耐火材料和建筑材料、辅助材料等二十个卫星厂是为本厂扩大再生产和基本建设服务的。为尽快实现这个规划，厂里将这批卫星厂的修建和扩建任务，作为“试验田”分配给各职能科室和车间，分工包建。党委全面领导，各级干部以身作则，深入实际，总结经验，及时解决具体问题，收到良好效果。目前，已建成投入生产的有轴承、炼焦、电焊条、水泥等十个卫星厂和车间，仅5月份的产值就达一百零三万余元。其他主要原料、材料和燃料，也将在更大范围内由本厂生产供应，为该厂进一步发展成为联合企业奠定了基础。
    本报兰州23日电　兰州炼油厂大搞多种经营，办起一整套机械工业、仪表制造工业，自己武装自己。目前全厂已形成九个系统，建成了八个以大装置为核心的生产基地，使现代化的石油企业发展成为联合企业。
    兰州炼油厂自从1958年完成第一期建厂工程以后，为了加速二期扩建工程，自力更生，自制配件设备，把原来仅仅担负维护检修的仪表室和机修厂，变成既搞维修又搞制造的仪表厂和机械厂。此后，在这个基础上又扩建了铸工车间，建起了一个完整的锻造、铸造、热处理、钢结构加工、金属加工、金属浇铸等机械设备和仪表制造体系。
    在生产方面，这个厂本着综合利用、多种经营、一厂多能的方针，大搞群众运动，土洋并举，大办卫星工厂。现在，他们已经办起了硫化油、异丙基苯氧化以及各种添加剂、石腊氧化、醇类、硫酸亚铁等三十多个卫星工厂。这些厂环绕主要生产装置，利用生产中的副产品、废气废水等进行加工，不仅生产出各种燃料油、润滑油等石油产品，而且还生产出了六七十种贵重的化工产品。在这个群众性大办卫星工厂的基础上，这个厂根据最大限度地利用资源，提高产值，增加品种的原则，又进行了全面规划，根据各生产装置的性质和特点，广泛采用新工艺、新技术，这样，就使全厂形成了各种添加剂、耐高温润滑油、低凝固点润滑油、高级醇、溶剂、气体综合利用、石腊综合利用、酸渣碱渣综合利用、综合性综合利用等九个系统；并以原有生产车间为基础，发展成八个生产基地。使石油工业和化学工业紧紧地结合在一起，互相利用，互相促进，形成一个石油化工综合性生产的企业。
    本报讯　齐齐哈尔车辆厂在
  “一业为主，一主多从”的方针指导下，正在向联合企业发展。
    随着国家交通运输事业的发展，这个工厂的货车产量猛增，原料、材料、燃料、辅助材料的需要量越来越多，为保证货车生产，这个厂的党委积极动员和组织广大职工，从生产需要出发，以车辆生产为主导，以发展钢铁材料为中心，大搞多种经营和原材料的综合利用，建立原材料基地。在很短时间内就建成了五十三个小型工厂，生产出大量铸件、生铁、焦炭、水泥、耐火材料、水玻璃、球墨机、混砂机、造型机等产品。还利用炉灰、炉渣、废砂制作了盐酸大块、空心楼板；并从煤气站煤焦油中提炼出了轻柴油、重柴油、沥青等。不仅保证了工厂主要产品——货车生产任务的完成，而且给逐步向联合企业发展开辟了广阔的道路。
    为了尽快办起更多卫星厂，工厂党委采取了下任务，定时间，各单位实行包建厂、包生产、包管理、包生活的办法。因而，从科室到车间，迅速掀起了一个大办卫星厂和多种经营的高潮。全厂仅两个月的时间，就生产出铸件六百四十六吨、焦炭一千四百八十五吨、电机五十三台，以及水玻璃、锻件等五十多种产品，有力地保证了完成工厂主要产品——货车的生产计划。
    这个工厂在大搞多种经营和综合利用中，贯彻了从生产出发，用什么办什么，缺什么搞什么，有什么利用什么，能够办什么就办什么的原则，既抓住重点，又遍地开花。过去，这个工厂的大部分组装货车的铸钢件、铸铁件都靠外地供应。1958年各兄弟工厂的生产任务大大增加，不能继续供应。他们就抽出几名老工人作技术指导，动员职工家属参加劳动，建成一个年产五千吨的铸铁卫星厂，解决了铸件的供应问题。
    最近，厂党委根据省、市委指示，决定把多种经营、综合利用的群众运动推向一个新高潮，在现有基础上，大干、特干，力争在不太长的时间内，把这个厂发展成为车辆、钢铁、化工燃料、建筑耐火材料、副食品五大生产基地的联合企业。（附图片）
