    Raise the Cup of Victory
    Yang Shuo
    Du Fu has two lines of poetry:
        "How can a strong man pull the Milky Way,
        To wash the armor clean, never to be used again."
    This great poet was anti-war, but not passively so. He eagerly hoped that there would be such brave men who could pull the Milky Way, use the water of the Milky Way to wash away the sins of war, and achieve peace. In Du Fu's time, such brave men were nowhere to be found. But today, our people have thought and ideals, and for the cause of socialism and human progress, they possess extraordinary strength and are determined to ultimately eliminate unjust wars through action. Just think: when American imperialism launched the Korean War ten years ago, the Chinese People's Volunteers, together with the Korean People's Army, fought many fierce battles, finally forcing the American aggressors to sign the armistice agreement with trembling hands at the negotiating table in Panmunjom, suing for peace with the Chinese and Korean people. In those numerous victorious battles, Yang Gensi, Huang Jiguang, and countless other heroic figures used their lives to write gold-shining names in history, names that will forever last as long as heaven and earth, and shine as brightly as the sun and moon. These countless people's heroes are precisely the brave men that Du Fu longed for, who pulled the Milky Way and washed the aggressive war launched by American imperialism into a messy, unmanageable state.
    One situation should particularly arouse our deep thought. In the early stages of the Korean War, the American invading army possessed highly mechanized equipment, truly armed to the teeth, while the Chinese and Korean People's Armies only had simple weapons. Yet, they were able to endure extreme hardships, braving wind and snow, beating the enemy one fall after another, pushing them all the way from the Yalu River to south of the 38th parallel. What was the reason? The Chinese and Korean People's Armies possessed unprecedented political consciousness and were fighting a just war; the enemy, however, was completely on the side of injustice, clinging to life and fearing death. Although their equipment was strong, the result was that they abandoned it all over the mountains and fields, simply sending gifts to the Chinese and Korean People's Armies.
    I particularly like the film "Shangganling," whose content very well expresses the Chinese People's Volunteers' heroic revolutionary spirit. When this film was shown in an African country, it stirred the hearts of many Africans and inspired their anti-imperialist fighting spirit. However, I also met a gentleman who shook his head at me, saying, "The fighting is too cruel! Why fight a war?"
    This gentleman had always styled himself as a "peace fighter" who advocated humanity the most. I smiled and replied to him at the time, "You'd better ask American imperialism why it traveled across the ocean, not hesitating to come all the way to Korea to fight a war!"
    That gentleman then said in a joking tone, "Perhaps they've gone crazy."
    I said, "They are war maniacs, but they are even more like germs that cultivate war."
    This is the root of war. Bedbugs must suck human blood; if they don't suck human blood, they will die. The nature of imperialism is to rely on aggression, war, and sucking the blood of other countries' people to enrich itself. Unless the germs that cause war are eliminated, humanity will not be able to achieve true and lasting peace. In those years on the Korean battlefield, I saw many volunteer soldiers, all so simple and kind. They loved their motherland, loved the people, loved life, loved nature, and loved peace even more. But they all understood that if you want to beg peace from war merchants, it's like asking a tiger for its skin; not only will you not get the skin, but you will be eaten by the tiger instead. Those who truly love peace will not hesitate to use all methods to fight for it. If the enemies of peace dare to launch a war, then they will use a just war to eliminate an unjust war. Those gentlemen who sing praises of peace may have the hearts of bodhisattvas, lamenting the disasters brought to the people by war, but how do you stop war? Even if you shed all your tears and say all the nicest words in the world, you will not be able to move the black heart of imperialism, which is full of the sins of war.
    Today, when we talk about it, the Korean War is already a past history, but history just proves one truth: peace is achieved through struggle.
    We should always remember: the enemies of peace are not sleeping and are scheming new conspiracies with malicious intentions. Although the war chieftain Eisenhower lost face and suffered a bloody nose in the Far East this time, it is hard to change one's nature. Recently, didn't he follow in Dulles' footsteps from last year and come to the vicinity of the Korean armistice line to hold a provocative military parade? How vigilant should those who truly love peace be!
    On the tenth anniversary of opposing the American pirates' invasion of Korea, let us raise the cup of victory to all the Chinese People's Volunteers who participated in that great war!

### 举起胜利之杯

    举起胜利之杯
    杨朔
    杜甫有两句诗说：
        安得壮士挽天河
        净洗甲兵长不用
    这位大诗人是反战的，却不是消极的反战。他热切盼望能有那样神勇的壮士，挽住天河，用天河的水冲洗罪恶的战争，取得和平。在杜甫那个时代，这样的壮士是找不到的。但在今天，我们的人民有思想、有理想，为着社会主义和人类进步的事业，具有异乎寻常的力量，是有决心来用行动最终消灭不义的战争的。请想想：当十年前美帝国主义发动侵朝战争时，中国人民志愿军曾经跟朝鲜人民军一起打过多少激烈的战斗，终于迫使美国侵略者不得不用抖颤的手，在板门店的谈判桌上签了字，向中朝人民求和。在那许多次胜利的战斗中，杨根思、黄继光以及数不尽的英雄人物都曾用他们的生命在历史上写下金光闪闪的名字，将永远与天地共长久，与日月争光辉。这数不尽的人民英雄不正是杜甫所想望的壮士，挽住天河，把美帝国主义发动的侵略战争冲洗得零零乱乱，无法收拾。
    有一个情况应该特别引起我们的深思。朝鲜战争初期，美国侵略军具有高度的机械化装备，真是武装到牙齿，而中朝人民军队呢，只有简单的武器，却能忍受着极端的艰难困苦，冲风冒雪，把敌人打得一个跟头又一个跟头，从鸭绿江边一直推到三八线以南，原因何在呢？中朝人民军队具有空前的政治觉悟，进行的是正义的战争；敌人呢，却完全站在非正义的一面，贪生怕死，装备虽强，结果抛得满山满野，无非是给中朝人民军队送来的礼物而已。
    我十分喜欢“上甘岭”这部影片，内容很能表现出中国人民志愿军那种气壮山河的革命气概。这部影片在非洲一个国家放映时，激动了许许多多非洲人的心，鼓舞起他们反帝的斗志。可是，我也遇见这样一位绅士，对我直摇头说：“打的太残酷了！为什么要打仗呢？”
    这位绅士素来自命为最讲人道的“和平战士”。我当时笑着回答他说：“你最好去问问美帝国主义，为什么要远涉重洋，不远千里而到朝鲜来打仗呢？”
    那位绅士便用开玩笑的口气说：“也许他们是发疯了。”
    我说：“他们是战争疯子，但他们更是开发性的战争细菌。”
    这就是战争的根源。臭虫必然要喝人血，不喝人血，就要死的。帝国主义的本性就是要靠侵略，靠战争，靠吮吸别国人民的血来自肥。不消灭爆发战争的毒菌，人类便无法得到真正持久的和平。当年在朝鲜战场上，我见过好些志愿军战士，都是那么朴素，那么善良。他们爱祖国、爱人民、爱生活、爱自然，更爱和平。但他们都懂得，你要想向战争贩子去乞求和平，等于向老虎去要它的皮，皮得不到，反而会叫老虎吃掉的。真正爱和平的人决不惜用各种方法去争取。如果和平的敌人竟敢发动战争，那么就用正义的战争去消灭非正义的战争。那些高唱和平的绅士先生们，也许你们有着一副菩萨心肠，惋惜战争给人民带来的灾难，可是你又怎样制止战争呢？你就是流干了眼泪，说尽人世间最好听的好话，你也说不动帝国主义那颗充满战争罪恶的黑心。
    今天说起来，朝鲜战争已经是过去的历史了，历史却恰好证明一个真理：和平是从斗争中取得的。
    应该时刻记着：和平的敌人并没睡觉，正在处心积虑地策划新的阴谋。战争头子艾森豪威尔虽然这次在远东丢尽脸面碰得头破血流，可是江山易改，本性难移，最近不是又步着去年杜勒斯的后尘，来到朝鲜停战线附近，举行一次挑衅性的军事检阅？真正爱和平的人应该怎样警惕啊！
    在反对美国海盗侵朝十周年的今天，谨让我们向所有参加过那次伟大战争的中国人民志愿军举起胜利之杯！
