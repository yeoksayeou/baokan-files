    Everything Rushing Forward
    The old "routine" of loose production at the beginning and tight at the end, low at the beginning and high at the end, is completely changeable, and a new routine of continuous leap forward and step-by-step improvement is completely establishable. The experience of the Hebi Coal Mine in Henan vividly proves this point.
    If one asks how the Hebi Coal Mine can achieve this, the key is to establish the guiding ideology of everything rushing forward and striving for initiative at every step. In the past, the Hebi Coal Mine also experienced uneven production and a passive situation of failing to complete tasks. The reason was that some people regarded the loose beginning and tight end, low beginning and high end as an unchangeable "routine" in industrial production, and therefore became accustomed to living in this "routine." Under the leadership of the Party committee, the workers of the Hebi Coal Mine thoroughly criticized this incorrect thinking, broke the old "routine," and established a new routine. As a result, the production outlook has greatly changed, and a prosperous situation of higher output every ten days, every month, and every quarter has emerged.
    What method can be used to achieve everything rushing forward and striving for initiative at every step? The experience of the Hebi Coal Mine is: grasping production with one hand and preparation with the other. That is, preparing for the second step while taking the first step. The leaders of the Hebi Mining Bureau focus on grasping production in the first and middle ten days of each month, and focus on grasping preparation in the last ten days. In the first and middle ten days of each month, they strive to complete most or all of the monthly plan, and in the last ten days, they organize overproduction on the one hand and prepare for the next month's production on the other. They often rush one step forward in this way, and as a result, if one step is active, every step becomes active.
    However, to achieve everything rushing forward and striving for initiative at every step, it is not enough to rely on a few leaders to rush and strive, but it is necessary to follow the mass line. During the "good start" high-yield rush in the first ten days of each month, the leading cadres and management personnel of the Hebi Mining Bureau go deep into the front line, participate in production with the masses, listen to the opinions of the masses, and solve problems in production management in a timely manner. After the high output in the first ten days is achieved, the leading cadres and management personnel come up to study and summarize experience, continue to solve the weak links found in the high output, and start preparing for the high-output battle in the middle ten days of the month. In the high-output battle in the middle ten days of the month, the leading cadres and management personnel go down to participate in production again, and then come up to study and summarize experience again, and then grasp the preparation for the "good start" in the next month. In this way, the process of leading cadres summarizing experience, going deep into production to solve problems, and overcoming weak links becomes a process of step-by-step increase in production.
    Establishing the guiding ideology of everything rushing forward and striving for initiative at every step, implementing the method of grasping production with one hand and preparation with the other, and the mass line of going deep into the front line of production, are the main experiences of Hebi Coal Mine's continuous and large-scale high production this year. This is a good experience. This experience is not only applicable to the coal mining industry, but also to other industrial enterprises, and can be greatly promoted.

### 一切往前赶

    一切往前赶
    生产前松后紧、前低后高的旧“常规”是完全可以改变的，持续跃进、步步高升的新常规是完全可以建立的。河南鹤壁煤矿的经验，生动地证明了这一点。
    如果要问鹤壁煤矿怎能做到这一点，关键的一条是树立了一切往前赶，步步争主动的指导思想。鹤壁煤矿过去也出现过生产不均衡和完不成任务的被动局面。原因是有些人把前松后紧、前低后高看成是工业生产上的一种不可改变的“常规”，因而也就习惯于在这种“常规”中过日子。鹤壁煤矿的职工在党委的领导下，彻底批判了这种不正确思想，打破了旧“常规”，树立了新常规。结果生产面貌大为改观，出现了一旬高一旬、一月高一月、一季高一季的兴旺局面。
    用什么方法才能做到一切往前赶、步步争主动呢？鹤壁煤矿的经验是：一手抓生产，一手抓准备。也就是走第一步的时候就准备好第二步。鹤壁矿务局领导上每月上中旬重点抓生产，下旬重点抓准备。在每月上中旬力争完成全月计划大部或全部，下旬一面组织超产，一面做好下月的生产准备。他们经常这样向前早赶一步，结果，一步主动了，步步也就主动了。
    可是要做到一切往前赶，步步争主动，光靠领导上少数人去赶去争是不行的，而必须走群众路线。鹤壁矿务局的领导干部和管理人员，在每月上旬搞“开门红”的突击高产时，就深入现场，和群众一起参加生产，倾听群众的意见，及时解决生产管理中的问题。上旬高产实现后，领导干部和管理人员再上来研究和总结经验，继续解决高产中发现的薄弱环节，并着手准备中旬高产战役。在中旬高产战役中，领导干部和管理人员再下去参加生产，然后再上来研究和总结经验，再抓下月“开门红”的准备工作。这样领导干部总结经验、深入生产解决问题、克服薄弱环节的过程，就成为生产步步高升的过程。
    树立一切往前赶，步步争主动的指导思想，实行一手抓生产，一手抓准备和深入生产第一线的群众路线方法，这是鹤壁煤矿今年以来持续大面积高产的主要经验。这是一个好经验。这个经验不仅适用于煤矿工业，而且也适用于其它工业企业，可以大大推广。
