Always Be a Vanguard on the Education Front

Representative of Xi'an Instrument Manufacturing Industrial School, Shaanxi Province: Yin Jun

    Since its establishment in 1956, the Xi'an Instrument Manufacturing Industrial School, under the strong leadership of the Party and illuminated by the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought, has held high the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune. Adhering to the principle of putting politics in command and vigorously engaging in mass movements, the school has experienced relatively rapid development despite being less than four years old. Particularly since 1958, it has resolutely implemented the Party's policy of "education serving proletarian politics and education being combined with productive labor," deeply carried out the education revolution, and brought about profound changes in the school's ideological outlook and work style. It has achieved significant results in teaching, production, scientific research, and other aspects, maintaining an overall and sustained leap forward in the school's work. Over the past two years, a large number of advanced units and individuals have emerged, and Party and Youth League organizations have continuously grown. In the education revolution, it has revised the education plan several times while both destroying the old and establishing the new, self-compiled 72 kinds of teaching syllabuses, textbooks, and teaching method guides, self-made more than 1,500 pieces of teaching instruments and visual aids, adjusted and newly established 21 laboratories, showrooms, and exhibition rooms, and established three professional teaching factories covering 24 types of work. More than 63% of the equipment was self-made, and nearly 100 technicians and more than 90 new teachers were trained, improving the quality of education and enabling more than 85% of students to achieve excellent results. Combining production labor, it produced 45 varieties of instruments, electrical appliances, machine tools, etc., totaling more than 16,680 units, achieving self-sufficiency in school funding for two consecutive years. The output value in 1959 increased more than twofold compared to 1958, reaching more than 2.43 million yuan, and this year it is planned to double again, with the total output value reaching 5.5 million yuan. In terms of scientific research and technological innovation, more than 6,000 projects have been completed and implemented, of which 143 in scientific research are precise new products, technologies, or processes. The school's cultural and sports activities are vigorously developing, and its work in eliminating pests and diseases, cleaning and sanitation, and militia training has consistently maintained the honorary title of advanced unit in the province, city, or district. Since July of last year, relevant leading departments of the province and city have successively held six on-site meetings at the school, and more than 3,480 units and 6,920 people from 26 provinces (regions) and cities across the country have visited and provided guidance. Since April of this year, according to Chairman Mao's educational thought and the principles of "appropriately shortening the duration, appropriately increasing the level, appropriately controlling class hours, and appropriately increasing labor" proposed by Comrade Lu Dingyi, we have launched a mass teaching reform movement, exposing and analyzing the serious phenomena of "less, slow, poor, and wasteful" existing in secondary vocational education. We have now compiled a new transitional education plan, 21 new teaching syllabuses, and 16 new textbooks. We have adopted the method of exposing, rectifying, experimenting, summarizing, and improving simultaneously, and this movement is developing in a deep and meticulous manner. At present, all teachers, students, and staff are working with full confidence to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in the school's work in 1960.
    Over the past few years, we have gained the following insights from our work:
    1. Establishing and consolidating the Party's absolute leadership over the school: Adhering to putting politics in command, strengthening political and ideological education, and giving play to the fighting fortress role of Party organizations. The Party is the supreme commander in building socialism. The education cause must be led by the Party. After the rectification movement and anti-rightist struggle in 1957, the leading core of the school's Party organization became stronger. Through the Party's ideological and organizational construction, the level of Party members was continuously improved, and the Party's organization was strengthened, making every work department of the school a proletarian ideological front. We put forward and adhered to the slogan of "Everyone puts politics in command, everything puts politics in command, always puts politics in command, everywhere puts politics in command, always listens to the Party, always listens to the Party," taking Mao Zedong Thought as the supreme guiding ideology for all work. The school Party committee not only strengthened political and ideological education but also strengthened the leadership of specific business work, going deep into teaching, production, and scientific research, and implementing political command in business. We adjusted the school's organizational structure and the Party's branch organization according to the development of work and the nature of business, clarifying that the central task of the school's Party organization is to lead teaching, using teaching to drive the overall situation, and firmly grasping the implementation of the Party's policies, work arrangements, ideological education, and the summarization and exchange of experience. The Party committee personally organized and led the school's "three materials" construction of talents, teaching materials, and equipment, insisting on going deep into the classroom and into the factory. The Party committee members divided their work to go deep into the grassroots, connecting with specialties and disciplines; the Party committee members concurrently held different courses, and through dissecting the "sparrow," they found the laws of teaching work and the internal connection between teaching work and other work, effectively guiding and promoting the work of the school in all aspects, making the school work show a prosperous scene of the central work taking the lead, other work blooming, mutual promotion, close cooperation, flying wing to wing, and high-speed development, giving full play to the core and fighting fortress role of the Party organization. At the same time, it gave full play to the organizational role of the Communist Youth League and the trade union, making them a link between the Party organization and the broad masses of teachers, students, and staff, closely linking the Party with the masses, inspiring and encouraging the enthusiasm of teachers and students for work and confidence in learning, and establishing a democratic and equal teacher-student relationship. Under the leadership of the Party, the whole Party was of one heart and the whole school was of one mind, providing a reliable guarantee for the implementation of the Party's policies.
    Practice has proven that every achievement and every step forward in the work reflects the struggle between two roads, two ideologies, and two methods. Constantly opposing and criticizing the bourgeois world outlook and establishing and developing the proletarian world outlook is the ideological foundation for ensuring that all work can continue to move forward. In the process of implementing the Party's education policy, some people in the school once mistakenly believed that "education combined with productive labor will inevitably affect the quality of teaching, and to ensure the quality of teaching, the school system must be extended." Some people blindly believed in experts, mystified scientific research, and believed that the conditions of secondary vocational schools were poor and the level was low, and they could not produce anything of fame, ridiculing our efforts to make microscopes as "irresponsible to the people." All of these reflected the bourgeois ideology of neglecting labor, being only expert but not red, separating theory from practice, and looking down on the masses. If we do not insist on fighting against these ideas, it will inevitably lead to the school training talents with less, slow, poor, and wasteful results. Under the leadership of the Party, we conducted a serious rational struggle against these erroneous ideas on the one hand, and on the other hand, we led the broad masses of teachers and students to start from scratch and establish a teaching factory on campus, completing the teaching tasks while also completing the production tasks outstandingly. Teachers, students, and workers combined, not only designed and trial-produced microscopes, but also designed and trial-produced more complex and sophisticated products such as spherometers. The vivid facts encouraged the broad masses of teachers and students, and also educated and enlightened those who opposed politics and business, advocating only being expert but not red, and recognized that education combined with productive labor is the only way to train talents who are both red and expert in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. In every movement and every work, we pay attention to first being ideological, then being practical, using ideology to drive practice, and combining ideology and practice; at the same time, we also pay attention to implementing the Party's policy of "unity-education-transformation" towards intellectuals, conscientiously organizing teachers' political theory learning, social practice, and labor training, and fully mobilizing all positive factors. Among students, we also paid attention to strengthening communist ideological education and current affairs policy education. Especially after the "red and expert debate" and education revolution in 1958, everyone had a red and expert plan, and every class had a code of conduct, further clarifying that without correct political views, it is equal to having no soul, and consolidating the new style of study of leading with red, being both red and expert, both studying seriously and working enthusiastically. The entire school formed a clear-cut, clear-oriented, united, energetic, cheerful, and high-spirited situation.
    2. Resolutely implement the Party's education policy, adhere to teaching as the main task, and vigorously engage in production and scientific research. The fundamental purpose of implementing the Party's education policy and carrying out the education revolution is to train socialist construction talents who are both red and expert in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. We adhered to the principle of teaching as the main task and teaching combined with productive labor, deeply led teaching, vigorously grasped industrial production and scientific research, cultivated the innovative spirit of teachers and students, improved the quality of education, and created huge wealth for the country. Some people once one-sidedly emphasized teaching as the main task, and they advocated the erroneous view that schools should teach what they do, do what they do, do how much they do, and calculate how much they do in production labor, and they cannot set varieties, set indicators, and cannot be included in the national plan. We resolutely opposed and criticized this erroneous view. Taking teaching as the main task must never be understood as students participating in production labor and carrying out scientific research activities only to verify book theory, or as something dispensable. On the contrary, education combined with productive labor is the central issue of the education revolution, and scientific research is an important link to improve the quality of teaching and promote production development. Therefore, under the premise of teaching as the main task, schools must combine teaching and vigorously engage in production and scientific research. In production labor, we start from the requirements of the comprehensive cultivation of students, paying attention to both social public welfare labor and industrial production combined with majors. The school runs factories, which are both teaching places and production labor bases, both training talents and manufacturing machines and instruments. Since 1958, we have started from scratch, made use of local resources, and established three professional teaching factories, putting production into the national plan, continuously increasing varieties, leaping forward in output value year after year, achieving self-sufficiency in funding, and supporting national construction. In carrying out scientific research activities, from scratch, first indigenous and then foreign, combining indigenous and foreign methods, adhering to scientific research serving teaching and production, teachers, students, and workers combined, schools, factories, and scientific research institutions working together, overcoming the difficulties in talents, equipment, and materials, over the past two years, on average, a project has been designed and put into trial production every twenty days. In the past, students participating in factory internships could only make small hardware tools such as hammers and pulleys, but now they can make precision machines and instruments. Students said: "In the past, after learning machine creation technology, I still couldn't figure out the mechanical structure, but now even if the machine is disassembled, I can quickly assemble it." In the past, electrical engineering was full of deriving formulas, and students couldn't even install light bulbs after studying for a year, but now they can install many instruments and meters. Countless facts have proven that resolutely implementing the Party's education policy, combining teaching and vigorously engaging in production and scientific research under the premise of teaching as the main task can rapidly improve the quality of education. The combination of teaching, production, and scientific research is the inevitable result of the in-depth development of the education revolution, and at the same time, it promotes the further in-depth development of the education revolution. We followed the Party's instructions, adhered to the principle of one main task, two auxiliary tasks, and three combinations, and never relaxed production labor and scientific research, so the school's work could develop at a high speed.
    3. Establish high aspirations, make great ambitions, do everything possible for high speed, vigorously and solidly engage in mass movements, and realize the continuous revolution of work methods. Without the lofty aspirations of the proletariat, there will be no great revolutionary enthusiasm. Revolution is about destroying the old and establishing the new. We resolutely opposed and criticized the bourgeois erroneous views such as "too many people, too many opinions," "too much planning, too much chaos," and "mass movements are chaotic and will disrupt teaching order," and used the mass line work method in all work in the school, continuously carrying out mass movements, with the power of thunder and the momentum of overturning mountains and seas. As a result, what was destroyed was only the old teaching order of the bourgeois theory divorced from reality, and what was gained was the huge harvest of the broad masses of teachers and students in political thought and teaching, production, and scientific research, the high play of mass wisdom and revolutionary enthusiasm, making the school work vigorous and new day by day. We not only adopted the mass line work method for revising the education plan, formulating the teaching syllabus, compiling textbooks, and teaching inspection, but also paid attention to combining major events and political movements in each period to break through the weak links in the work. Last year, we took advantage of the school's first Party congress to achieve kitchen mechanization in a short period of time, quickly reversed the phenomenon of food overspending, and became an advanced unit in saving food. Combining the study of the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, we made more than 1,000 visual aids in one month, and used actually less than three or four months to overfulfill the political task of making 10,200 pairs of spectacle-style theater glasses for the People's Great Hall, a commemorative product for the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country. Since March of this year, in order to welcome the convocation of the National and Provincial and Municipal Cultural and Educational Hero Meetings, the original plan to complete 100 scientific research and technological innovation projects in one year was proposed to propose more than 7,000 scientific research projects and innovation proposals in two months, realizing more than 3,400 projects, and trial-producing some fine new products. Without mass movements, these things would be unthinkable. Most facts have proven that only by carrying out mass movements in a planned, organized, and led manner, and paying attention to the good combination of the climax of the movement and consolidation and improvement, can we maximize the enthusiasm and creativity of teachers, students, and staff, and enable the school's work to develop at a high speed with more, faster, better, and more economical results.
    4. Developing the communist spirit and vigorously engaging in collaboration inside and outside the school is an important factor in promoting the school's Great Leap Forward. Over the past two years, we have not only insisted on mutual support and cooperation between various departments within the school, but also established regular cooperative relations with 219 units in 26 provinces and cities across the country, exchanging information, helping each other, encouraging each other, and promoting each other, reflecting the school-running method of the mass line and the principle of combining theory with practice and combining education with productive labor on a broader basis. We often receive assistance from relevant factories and schools, and we also regard the difficulties of brother units as our own difficulties, actively helping to solve them. One flower is not spring, but a hundred flowers in full bloom is spring. Over the past few years, we have been using our own manpower, equipment, and materials to support brother units, such as assisting Xi'an No. 3 Middle School and other schools to establish a complete set of production labor bases, and training 306 apprentices for the Shaanxi Provincial Machinery Bureau and other units. In the past year alone, we have extracted and manufactured more than 130 machine tools, 5,600 sets of ball bearings, and more than 80,000 kilograms of hardware and chemical materials, supporting and assisting 36 schools, 183 government agencies, enterprises, and people's communes, and provided brother units with more than 2,000 copies of experience materials. Due to mutual cooperation and mutual support, not only did we timely absorb the experience of brother units, improved our work, and overcome difficulties, but also the broad masses of teachers and students received a profound communist ideological education of leaving the difficulties to themselves and giving convenience to others. More importantly, the cooperation between schools, factories, and research institutions has powerfully promoted the leap forward of scientific and technological research, technological innovation, and technological revolution, making the two great torrents of technological revolution and cultural revolution converge and leap forward together.
    5. Hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, boost revolutionary energy, constantly oppose right-leaning conservatism, constantly make revolution, and continue to leap forward. In the revolutionary process, old contradictions are overcome, and new contradictions will arise. After we revised the education plan for the first time, some people said: "Now it meets the education policy, and it can be stabilized in the future." In 1958, the school was self-sufficient in funding, and some people became proud, thinking that they had reached the top. In response to these arrogant and complacent, right-leaning conservative ideas, the Party committee immediately armed everyone with Chairman Mao's thought of continuous revolution, so that the education plan was revised several times in the implementation process, and the total output value in 1959 increased on the basis of 1958, and 1960 doubled on the basis of 1959. Over the past few years, the school has gone from work-study to running factories in a big way, and from running factories in a big way to putting production into the national plan, vigorously engaging in production and scientific research under the principle of teaching as the main task. This is a process of continuous revolution; from the combination of teachers, workers, and students, the combination of teaching, production, and scientific research, to the combination of schools, factories, and research institutions, this is also a process of continuous development. "Modesty makes one progress, and pride makes one fall behind." Over the past few years, we have always insisted on guiding all work with Mao Zedong Thought, and only then have we achieved an overall and sustained leap forward in the school's work.
    The achievements of our school are the victory of the wise leadership of our great Party and Chairman Mao, the victory of the Party's general line for socialist construction and the Party's education policy, and also the result of all teachers, students, and staff of the school holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhering to putting politics in command, implementing the mass line, and unswervingly implementing the Party's education policy. This year is the first year of the 1960s and the third year of the overall and sustained leap forward in my country's socialist construction cause. Compared with the requirements of the objective situation development of our country's entire socialist construction, what we have done in education is still far behind. Under the great situation that the climax of the cultural revolution has been formed, in order to achieve a great development, great popularization, and great improvement in the education cause, we resolutely follow the teachings of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, deeply study Chairman Mao's works, hold the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, and under the leadership of Party committees at all levels and superior business departments, we will boost our energy and strive for the top, while paying attention to the principle of combining work and rest; while daring to think, dare to say, and dare to do, we will pay attention to everything through experimentation; while establishing great ambitions, we will pay attention to a down-to-earth work style; we will develop the communist spirit of cooperation and humbly learn from the advanced experience of brother units. We will resolutely carry out teaching reform, adhere to one main task, two auxiliary tasks, and three combinations, continue to unswervingly implement the Party's education policy, do everything possible to improve the quality of education, climb the peak of science and culture, always be a vanguard on the education front, and strive to train more, faster, better, and more economical secondary technical talents for socialist construction who are both red and expert.

    永远做教育战线上的尖兵
    陕西省西安仪器制造工业学校代表　尹钧
    西安仪器制造工业学校从1956年建校以来，在党的坚强领导下，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的三面红旗，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，虽然建校还不到四年，但工作却有着比较快的发展。特别是1958年以来，坚决贯彻执行了党的“教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”方针，深入开展了教育革命，使学校的思想面貌和工作面貌发生了极其深刻的变化，在教学、生产、科学研究等各项工作中取得了明显的成绩，保持了学校工作的全面持续跃进。两年多来，学校涌现出大批先进单位和先进个人，党团组织不断壮大。在教育革命中边破边立，数次修订了教育计划，自编了教学大纲、教材和教学法指导书七十二种，自制了一千五百余件教学仪器和直观教具，调整和新设了二十一个实验室、陈列室和展览室，建立了包括二十四个工种的三个专业教学工厂，其中63％以上的设备均系学校自制，培养了近百名技术工人和九十余名新教师，提高了教育质量，使学生获得优良成绩的人数达到85％以上。结合生产劳动，生产了各种仪器、电器、机床等四十五个品种共一万六千六百八十余台件，连续两年实现了学校经费自给。1959年的产值又比1958年增加一倍以上，达到了二百四十三万余元，今年计划又加一番，总产值将达到五百五十万元。在科学研究和技术革新方面，先后完成和实现了六千多个项目，其中在科学研究上完成的一百四十三项，都是精密的新的产品、技术或工艺。学校文娱、体育活动蓬勃开展，除害灭病、清洁卫生、民兵训练等工作一直保持着省、市或区的先进单位光荣称号。去年7月以来，省、市有关领导部门曾先后在学校召开了六次现场会议，来校参观指导的有全国二十六个省（区）市的三千四百八十余个单位，六千九百二十多人次。今年4月份以来，我们根据毛主席的教育思想和陆定一同志所提出的“适当缩短年限，适当提高程度，适当控制学时，适当增加劳动”的原则，开展了群众性的教学改革运动，揭发和分析了存在于中等专业教育中的少慢差费严重现象，现在已编写出新的过渡性的教育计划，二十一份新的教学大纲和十六种新的教材。我们采取了边揭发、边整改、边试验、边总结、边提高的办法，这个运动正在深入细致的发展。当前全校师生员工正信心百倍地为实现1960年学校工作更大更好和更全面的跃进而努力。
  几年以来，我们在工作中有以下几点体会，
  一、确立和巩固党对学校的绝对领导：坚持政治挂帅，加强政治思想教育，发挥党组织的战斗堡垒作用。党是建设社会主义的最高统帅。教育事业必须由党来领导。经过1957年的整风运动和反右斗争，学校党组织的领导核心更加坚强了，通过党的思想建设和组织建设，不断提高了党员水平，壮大了党的组织，使学校各个工作部门都成为无产阶级的思想阵地。我们提出并坚持了“人人政治挂帅，事事政治挂帅，时时政治挂帅，处处政治挂帅，处处听党的话，永远听党的话”的口号，一切工作以毛泽东思想为最高指导思想，学校党委既加强了政治思想教育，又加强了对具体业务工作的领导，深入教学、生产和科学研究，在业务上实行政治挂帅。我们根据工作发展和业务性质调整了学校组织机构和党的支部组织，明确了学校党组织的中心任务是领导教学，以教学带动全盘，紧紧抓住了党的方针政策的贯彻执行、工作安排、思想教育及总结和交流经验，党委亲自组织领导学校人材、教材、器材的
  “三材”建设，坚持深入课堂，走进工厂。党委委员分工深入基层，联系专科、学科；党委委员分别兼任不同课程，通过解剖“麻雀”，找出了教学工作的规律和教学工作与其他工作的内在联系，有力地指导和推动了学校各方面的工作，使学校工作出现了中心工作一马当先，其他工作百花争艳，互相促进，密切配合，比翼齐飞和高速度发展的繁荣景象，充分发挥了党组织的核心和战斗堡垒作用。同时，充分发挥共青团和工会的组织作用，使其成为党组织联系教育广大师生职工的纽带，密切党群关系，启发了和鼓舞了师生工作热情和学习信心，建立了民主平等的师生关系。在党的领导下，全党一条心，全校一股劲，为贯彻党的方针政策提供了可靠的保证。
    实践证明，每一项成绩的取得和工作过程中每前进一步，都反映着两条道路、两种思想和两种方法的斗争。不断反对和批判资产阶级世界观，树立和发展无产阶级世界观，是保证一切工作得以不断前进的思想基础。在贯彻执行党的教育方针的过程中，学校一些人曾经错误地认为，“教育结合生产劳动必然要影响教学质量，要保证教学质量就必须延长学制”。一些人迷信专家，把科学研究神秘化，认为中等专业学校的条件差，水平低，搞不出什么名堂，讥笑我们搞显微镜是“对人民不负责任”。所有这些，都反映了轻视劳动，只专不红，理论脱离实际和看不起群众的资产阶级思想。对这些思想如果不坚持斗争，就势必要形成学校培养人材的少、慢、差、费。在党的领导下，我们对这些错误思想一方面进行严肃的说理斗争，一方面领导广大师生白手起家地在校内建立起教学工厂，在完成教学任务的同时，也出色地完成了生产任务。教师、学生、工人三结合，不仅设计试制成了显微镜，而且还设计试制成功了比显微镜更复杂精细的球径仪等精尖产品。生动的事实鼓舞了广大师生，也教育和启发了那种把政治和业务对立起来，主张只专不红的人，认识到教育结合生产劳动是多快好省培养又红又专人材的唯一道路。我们在每次运动和每件工作中，都注意先务虚，后务实，以虚带实，虚实结合；同时又注意贯彻了党对知识分子“团结——教育——改造”的政策，认真组织教师的政治理论学习、社会实践和劳动锻炼，充分的调动了一切积极因素。在学生中也注意加强了共产主义思想教育和时事政策教育。特别是经过1958年的“红专辩论”和教育革命，人人订有红专规划，班班订有品行公约，师生进一步明确了没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂，巩固地树立了以红带专，又红又专，既认真读书，又热情劳动的新学风。整个学校形成了一个旗帜鲜明，方向明确，团结一致，生气勃勃，心情舒畅，斗志昂扬的局面。
    二、坚决贯彻执行党的教育方针，坚持以教学为主，大搞生产，大搞科学研究。贯彻党的教育方针，开展教育革命的根本目的，在于多快好省地培养又红又专的社会主义建设人材。我们坚持了以教学为主，教学结合生产劳动的原则，深入领导教学，大抓工业生产和科学研究，既培养了师生的独创精神，提高了教育质量，又为国家创造了巨大的财富。一些人曾经片面强调以教学为主，他们主张学校搞生产劳动应该教什么，做什么，做多少，算多少，不能定品种订指标，不能纳入国家计划等错误观点。我们坚决反对和批判了这种错误观点。以教学为主，绝不能理解为学生参加生产劳动和开展科研活动仅仅是为了验证书本理论，或是可有可无的事情。恰恰相反，教育结合生产劳动是教育革命的中心问题，而科学研究又是提高教学质量和促进生产发展的重要环节。因此，学校在以教学为主的前提下，必须结合教学大搞生产，大搞科研。在生产劳动上，我们从对学生的全面培养的要求出发，既注意社会公益劳动，也注意结合专业的工业生产。学校办工厂，既是教学场所，又是生产劳动基地，既培养人材，又制造机器仪器。从1958年以来，我们白手起家，因陋就简，建立了三个专业教学工厂，把生产纳入国家计划，品种不断增加，产值连年跃进，实现了经费自给，支援了国家建设。在开展科学研究活动中，从无到有，先土后洋，土洋结合，坚持科学研究为教学、生产服务，教师、学生、工人三结合，学校、工厂、科学研究机关大协作，克服人材、设备、资料等方面的重重困难，两年多来，平均每隔二十天就有一个项目设计成功，投入试制。过去，学生参加工厂实习，只能做鎯头、滑轮之类的小五金工具，现在却能做精密的机器和仪器了。学生说：“过去学了机器创造工艺学，还是弄不清机械结构，现在就是把机器拆散，也能很快把它装起了”。过去电工学尽是推导公式，学生学了一年连电灯都不会安装，现在却能装许多仪器仪表了。无数的事实证明，坚决贯彻党的教育方针，在以教学为主的前提下，结合教学大搞生产，大搞科学研究，就能迅速提高教育质量。教学、生产、科学研究三结合，是教育革命深入发展的必然结果，同时它又反过来促进教育革命进一步的深入发展。我们遵循党的指示，坚持一主二副三结合，对生产劳动和科学研究一直没有放松，因此使学校工作得以高速度的发展。
    三、树雄心，立大志，千方百计高速度，轰轰烈烈，扎扎实实大搞群众运动，实现工作方法的不断革命。没有无产阶级的雄心壮志，就不会有伟大的革命干劲。革命就是破旧立新。我们坚决地反对和批判了“人多嘴杂”、“谋多则乱”、“群众运动乱哄哄，会破坏教学秩序”等资产阶级的错误观点，在学校一切工作中运用了群众路线的工作方法，接连不断地开展群众运动，以雷霆万钧之力，排山倒海之势，大搞群众运动。结果破坏的只是资产阶级理论脱离实际的旧教学秩序，得到的却是广大师生在政治思想上和教学、生产、科学研究上的巨大的丰收、群众智慧和革命干劲的高度发挥，使学校工作生气勃勃，日新又新。我们不仅对修订教育计划、制订教学大纲、编写教材、教学检查等工作采取了群众路线的工作方法，而且也注意结合每个时期的重大事件和政治运动来突破工作中的薄弱环节。去年，我们趁着学校召开首届党代表大会，短期内实现炊事机械化，很快扭转了粮食超支现象而成为节约粮食的先进单位。结合八届八中全会文件学习，一个月即制作一千多件直观教具，用实际上不到三、四个月的时间超额完成建国十周年荣誉产品人民大会堂用的眼镜式观剧镜一万零二百付的政治任务。今年3月以来，为迎接全国和省、市文教群英会的召开原计划一年完成的一百项科学研究和技术革新项目，经过两个月的时间，即提出七千多件科学研究项目和革新建议，实现了三千四百余项，而且试制成功一些精新的产品。如果没有群众运动，这些事情都是不能设想的。多数事实证明，只有有计划、有组织、有领导地开展群众运动，并注意使运动高潮与巩固提高很好地结合起来，就能最大限度地调动师生员工的积极性、创造性，就能使学校工作多快好省的高速度发展。
    四、发扬共产主义精神，大搞校内外协作，是促进学校大跃进的重要因素。两年多来，我们不仅坚持在学校内部各个部门间的互相支援和彼此协作，而且还和全国二十六个省、市的二百一十九个单位建立了经常的协作关系，互通情报，互济有无，互相鼓舞，互相促进，在更广泛的基础上体现了群众路线的办学方法和理论联系实际、教育与生产劳动相结合的原则。我们经常得到有关厂、校的协助，而我们也把兄弟单位的困难看做自己的困难，积极帮助解决。一朵鲜花不是春，万紫千红才是春。几年来，我们一直用自己的人力、设备、资料支援兄弟单位，如协助西安市第三中学等校建立了成套的生产劳动基地，为陕西省机械局等单位培养了三百零六名徒工。仅去年一年即抽出和制造了一百三十余台机床、五千六百套滚珠轴承、八万多公斤五金化学材料，支援协助了三十六所学校、一百八十三个机关、企业单位和人民公社，并供给了兄弟单位二千多份经验资料。由于互相协作，彼此支援，不仅使我们及时吸取了兄弟单位的经验，改进了我们的工作，克服了困难，而且使广大师生受到了深刻的把困难留给自己，把方便送给别人的共产主义思想教育。更重要的是学校、工厂、研究机关之间的协作，有力地推动了科学技术研究的飞跃、技术革新和技术革命的开展，使技术革命和文化革命两大洪流汇合，共同跃进。
    五、高举毛泽东思想红旗，鼓足革命干劲，不断反对右倾保守，不断革命，持续跃进。在革命过程中旧的矛盾克服了，新的矛盾又会产生出来。当我们第一次修订教育计划之后，有人就说：“这下合乎教育方针了，今后可以稳定下来了”。1958年，学校经费自给，有人就骄傲了起来，认为已经到了顶头。针对这些骄傲自满、右倾保守思想，党委立即以毛主席的不断革命论的思想武装大家，使教育计划在执行中经过数次修改，1959年的生产总值在1958年的基础上加番，1960年又在1959年的基础上成倍增长。几年来，学校从勤工俭学到大办工厂，从大办工厂到生产纳入国家计划，在教学为主的原则下大搞生产，大搞科学研究，这是一个不断革命的过程；从教师、工人、学生三结合，教学、生产、科学研究三结合，到学校、工厂、研究机关三结合，这也是一个不断发展的过程。“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”。几年来，我们始终坚持以毛主席的思想指导一切工作，才取得了学校工作的全面持续跃进。
    我们学校所取得的成绩，这是我们伟大的党和毛主席英明领导的胜利，是党的社会主义建设总路线和党的教育方针的胜利，也是全校师生员工高举毛泽东思想红旗，坚持政治挂帅，贯彻群众路线，坚定不移地贯彻执行党的教育方针的结果。今年，是六十年代的第一年，是我国社会主义建设事业全面持续跃进的第三年，我们在教育工作方面所做到的一些工作，和我们国家整个社会主义建设的客观形势发展的要求比较起来，还差得很远。在文化革命高潮已经形成的大好形势下，为了教育事业的大发展、大普及、大提高，我们坚决遵循着党中央和毛主席的教导，深入学习毛主席的著作，更高地举起毛泽东思想的红旗，在各级党委和上级业务部门的领导下，鼓足干劲、力争上游的同时，注意劳逸结合的原则；在敢想敢说敢做的同时，注意一切经过试验；大立雄心壮志，同时注意踏踏实实的工作作风；发扬共产主义协作精神，虚心学习各兄弟单位的先进经验。坚决将教学改革搞好，坚持一主二副三结合，继续坚定不移地贯彻党的教育方针，千方百计提高教育质量，攀登科学文化高峰，永远做教育战线上的尖兵，为更多更快更好更省地培养又红又专的社会主义建设的中等技术人材而奋斗。
