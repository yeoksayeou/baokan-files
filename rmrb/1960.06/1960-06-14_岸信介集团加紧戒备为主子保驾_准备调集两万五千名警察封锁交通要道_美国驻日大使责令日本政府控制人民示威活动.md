Xinhua News Agency, June 13th, Tokyo Dispatch: The Japanese Kyodo News Agency says that the Kishi Nobusuke government, in order to "protect" its master, Eisenhower, who is coming to Japan to conduct war planning activities, is currently undertaking Japan's "largest-scale security deployment since the founding of the nation."

According to reports in Japanese newspapers today, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department originally planned to mobilize 15,000 police officers to "protect" Eisenhower on the 19th, but now has decided to increase the number of police mobilized to 25,000. The newspapers pointed out that this number is equal to one-fifth of all police in Japan.

On the 19th, Japanese police will ride in more than sixty trucks, motorcycles, and patrol cars to "protect" Eisenhower's car, and three hundred patrol cars will be deployed inside and outside the airport. The road from Tokyo Airport to the Imperial Palace, as well as key traffic routes in Tokyo, will be filled with fully armed police.

The newspapers revealed that the Metropolitan Police Department made this decision to strengthen the suppression of the Japanese people after being panicked by the incident in which the Japanese people held a powerful anti-American demonstration at the airport on the 10th, surrounding US Presidential Press Secretary Hagerty. To implement this plan, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department has decided to request police authorities in ten neighboring prefectures of Tokyo, as well as Osaka and Nagoya, to send "reinforcements" to Tokyo.

It is reported that the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department has also decided to suppress patriotic demonstrations against the US President's visit to Japan, and will prevent all demonstration groups from passing on the road from Haneda International Airport to the Imperial Palace on that day.

It is reported that the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department yesterday mobilized a total of about seventy motorcycles, trucks, and vehicles equipped with radio communication equipment to conduct a "guard" exercise for Eisenhower.

Xinhua News Agency, June 12th, Tokyo Dispatch: Despite it being Sunday, Japanese Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke and US Ambassador MacArthur II specially held talks on the issue of Eisenhower's visit to Japan.

During the talks, the US Ambassador put on the airs of a master. A statement issued by the US Embassy after the talks revealed that the US Ambassador pointed out to Kishi Nobusuke that the United States "had a very strong, unfavorable reaction" to the demonstrations against Stephens and Hagerty that took place at the airport. The Associated Press said that "the United States put tremendous pressure on Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke on Sunday" to "control" the people's demonstrations during Eisenhower's visit to Japan.

They also discussed the details of Eisenhower's visit schedule during the talks.

    岸信介集团加紧戒备为主子保驾
    准备调集两万五千名警察封锁交通要道
    美国驻日大使责令日本政府控制人民示威活动
    新华社13日讯　东京消息：日本共同社说，岸信介政府为了“保护”他的主子艾森豪威尔到日本来进行策划战争部署的活动，目前正在进行日本“建国以来的规模最大的戒备部署”。
    据日本各家报纸今天报道，东京警视厅原来预定在19日那天，动员一万五千名警察为艾森豪威尔
  “保驾”，现在决定将动员的警察名额增加到两万五千名。报纸指出，这个数目等于日本全体警察的五分之一。
    在19日那天，日本警察将乘六十多辆卡车、摩托车、巡逻车在艾森豪威尔的车子周围“保驾”，另外还要在机场内外布设三百辆巡逻车。从东京机场到皇宫的路上以及东京市内的交通要道，都将布满全副武装的警察。
    报纸透露，警视厅是在日本人民10日在机场举行强大的反美示威，把美国总统新闻秘书哈格蒂包围起来的事件发生以后惊慌万状而作出这个加强镇压日本人民的决定的。为了实行这个计划，东京警视厅已经决定请求东京邻近十个县和大阪、名古屋警察当局派遣“救兵”前来东京支援。
      据报道，东京警视厅还决定要镇压反对美国总统访日的爱国示威，当天将从羽田国际机场到皇宫的道路上阻止一切示威队伍通行。
    据报道，东京警视厅昨天动员了共约七十辆摩托车、卡车和装配无线电讯机器的汽车进行了“警卫”艾森豪威尔的演习。
    据新华社12日讯　东京消息：尽管今天是星期天，日本首相岸信介和美国大使麦克阿瑟第二还特地就艾森豪威尔访问日本问题进行了会谈。
    在会谈中，美国大使摆出了一副主子的架子。美国大使馆在会谈后发表的声明透露，美国大使向岸信介指出，美国对机场上发生的向斯蒂芬斯和哈格蒂进行的示威“产生了非常强烈的、不好的反应”。美联社说，“美国在星期日对岸信介首相施加了巨大的压力”，要他在艾森豪威尔访日时“控制”人民的示威活动。
    他们在会谈中还讨论了艾森豪威尔访问日程的细节。
