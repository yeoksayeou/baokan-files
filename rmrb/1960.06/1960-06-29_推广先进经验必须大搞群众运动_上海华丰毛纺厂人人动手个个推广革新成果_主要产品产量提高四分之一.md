To Promote Advanced Experiences, We Must Launch a Mass Movement
Shanghai Huafeng Woolen Mill—Everyone Participates and Promotes Innovation Achievements, Main Product Output Increases by One-Quarter

(Our dispatch from Shanghai, June 28th) In the process of promoting new technologies and new experiences, Shanghai Huafeng Woolen Mill conducted in-depth and meticulous sorting of innovation projects, and boldly mobilized the masses to evaluate, summarize, and promote them, quickly creating a vigorous new situation of "everyone participating and everyone promoting." In the past month or so, the utilization rate of innovation projects has risen from the original 50% to 95%. Materials, manpower, and technical problems that were previously considered unsolvable have been quickly resolved, and the output of major products has increased by about one-quarter.

This factory has created and invented many things in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, basically realizing the mechanization and semi-mechanization of the entire factory's production. However, in the process of promotion and use, due to insufficient mass mobilization at the beginning, about half of the factory's innovation projects were not widely promoted and adhered to. Therefore, new creations and inventions were not directly reflected in production, promoting production development.

Why did this situation occur? The Huafeng Woolen Mill's Party General Branch held an enlarged meeting to analyze the reasons. Everyone believed that, in addition to the innovation projects themselves still having imperfect aspects, the main reason why new technologies and new experiences could not be promoted was that workers were not skilled or accustomed to operating them, especially because workers did not fully understand the significance and role of promoting these new technologies and new experiences. The key to this result was that some cadres held a view that they did not believe in the wisdom and creativity of the masses, thinking that Huafeng Woolen Mill had many female workers and few technicians, and that mobilizing the masses to work together would not solve the problem of resolving more technical key points. Because of this, the masses were not fully mobilized, and only a few people were relied upon to do the work of modifying equipment and promoting new technologies. The factory Party General Branch Committee negated this view, believing that the widespread promotion and use of innovation projects involved every worker, every process, and every machine. If the workers using the machines did not have an urgent need to use new technologies, even the best innovation projects would be difficult to promote. On the other hand, a large number of innovation projects still needed to be evaluated, summarized, and improved. Without mobilizing the masses to work together, it would not be possible to do a good job if limited to a few technicians and maintenance workers. It affirmed that the promotion of new technologies and new experiences must also, like creation and invention, launch a mass movement and follow the mass line.

According to the decision of the Party General Branch's enlarged meeting, all workshops in the factory universally sorted out the promotion and use of innovation projects, mobilized the masses to speak out and debate on key issues, and evaluated the innovation projects one by one. As a result, the situation quickly changed. For example, after the cadres of the packaging workshop returned to the workshop, they immediately organized workers to debate around a series of questions: Is the new yarn-picking rack good or bad? Should it be promoted? How should it be improved? In the debate, the workers fully expressed their opinions. Some said: "The new yarn-picking rack is not good. The wool often slips off automatically after being placed on it, which affects product quality and is more troublesome." However, most workers believed that the new yarn-picking rack was definitely better than the old one. Not only was the labor intensity reduced, but the output could also be greatly increased. If there were shortcomings at present, they could be improved. The workshop Party branch supported the latter opinion and organized everyone to put forward improvement suggestions. As soon as the masses used their brains, the problem was immediately found. The masses did not wait for the cadres to arrange it, and immediately took action to improve it. As a result, all the yarn-picking racks were modified and put into production within three days, and the daily output increased from the original 4,000 kilograms to 6,000 kilograms.

Because the masses participated in the work of evaluating, summarizing, improving, and promoting new technologies and new experiences, they became more familiar with new technologies and new experiences and had a deeper affection for them. Therefore, when they discovered problems and shortcomings, they always consciously tried every means to improve them. For example, the semi-automatic doffing machine was originally too heavy and the copper plate was uneven, so workers did not like to use it. After improvement, the weight was reduced from 17 jin to about 5 jin. The workers also collectively summarized the "eight-character" operating experience, which reduced the doffing time from the original average of 150 seconds per doffing to 40 seconds, and the number of ends down was reduced from 26 to 10. Even workers who previously did not like to use semi-automatic doffing machines said: "Even if you don't let me use it, I will use it."

Adopting the method of mass movement to consolidate and promote innovation projects has exerted great power in the Huafeng Woolen Mill. Problems such as materials, manpower, and technology that were previously considered unsolvable have been quickly resolved. Recently, the factory's product variety has been changed from pure wool to blended. According to the previous plan, a batch of workers was to be added. Due to the promotion of the self-stopping device for ends down on the pin combing machine, each worker's ability to manage machines was increased from one to two, increasing production without adding personnel. The workers in the packaging workshop further developed the yarn-picking rack into a production line that integrates yarn-picking, twisting, pressing, sealing, printing, and packaging, enabling the daily output to jump from 6,000 jin to 7,500 jin. On June 24, the factory had already comprehensively completed the semi-annual plan ahead of schedule. Currently, on the basis of consolidating and improving the achievements of technical innovation in the previous stage, a new upsurge of innovation is being launched to strive for a greater leap forward in the second half of the year.

    推广先进经验必须大搞群众运动
    上海华丰毛纺厂人人动手个个推广革新成果　主要产品产量提高四分之一
    本报上海28日电　上海华丰毛纺厂在推广新技术、新经验的过程中，深入细致地进行革新项目排队，放手发动群众鉴定、总结和推广，使全厂很快出现了一个“人人动手，个个推广”的轰轰烈烈的新局面。在最近一个多月内，革新项目的使用率已由原来的50％上升到95％，原来感到无法解决的材料、人力、技术问题都很快得到解决，主要产品的产量提高了四分之一左右。
    这个厂在技术革新和技术革命运动中创造发明很多，基本上实现了全厂生产机械化和半机械化。但是，在推广使用过程中，由于开初发动群众不够，全厂有一半左右的革新项目没有得到普遍推广，坚持使用，因而新的创造发明没有直接反映到生产上，促进生产发展。
    为什么会产生这种情况呢？华丰毛纺厂党总支召开了扩大会议分析原因。大家认为，除了革新项目本身还有不够完善的地方以外，新技术、新经验不能推广的原因，主要是工人操作不熟练，不习惯，特别是由于工人还没有完全了解推广这些新技术、新经验的意义和作用。而造成这种结果的关键，又在于部分干部中间存在着一种不相信群众智慧和创造力的观点，认为华丰毛纺厂女工多，技工少，要解决更多的技术关键，发动群众一起干不解决问题。正因为如此，所以没有充分地把群众发动起来，而只是依靠少数人做改装设备、推广新技术的工作。厂党总支委员会否定了这种看法，认为革新项目的普遍推广使用牵涉到每一个工人、每一道工序和每一台机器，如果使用机器的工人对使用新技术没有迫切要求，再好的革新项目也很难推广。另一方面，大量的革新项目还需要鉴定、总结、提高，不发动群众大家一起动手，仅限于少数技术人员和保全、检修工人来做是做不好的。肯定了推广新技术、新经验也必须和创造发明一样，大搞群众运动，大走群众路线。
    根据党总支扩大会议的决定，全厂各工段普遍对革新项目推广使用的情况进行了排队，发动群众针对关键鸣放、辩论，对革新项目逐一鉴定。这样，情况很快就发生了变化。例如包装工段的干部回到车间以后，立即围绕拣线架到底好不好、要不要推广使用？怎么改进？这一连串的问题，组织工人展开辩论。在辩论中，工人们充分发表了自己的意见。有的说：“新的拣线架不好，绒线放上后常常会自动滑落，影响产品质量，反而麻烦”。但大部分工人却认为，新的拣线架肯定比老的好，不但劳动强度减轻，产量还可以大大增加，目前有缺点可以改进。车间党支部支持了后一种意见，并且组织大家提改进意见，群众一动脑筋，问题马上找到，群众不等干部布置，立即动手改进，结果三天之内就把拣线架全部改好，投入生产，日产量由原来的四千公斤上升到了六千公斤。
    由于群众参加了新技术、新经验的鉴定、总结、改进推广的工作，对新技术、新经验也就更加熟悉，有了更深的感情，因而发现了什么问题和缺点，总是自觉地千方百计地去改进它。比如半自动落纱机原来太重，铜板也不平，工人都不喜欢使用它，经过改进以后，重量由十七斤减到五斤上下。工人们又集体总结出“八字”操作经验，使落纱时间由原来的平均每落一次纱一百五十秒减少到了四十秒，断头也由二十六根降低到十根。连过去不喜欢用半自动落纱机的工人都说：“不要我用我也要用了”。
    采用群众运动的办法来巩固、推广革新项目，在华丰毛纺厂发挥出巨大的威力。原来感到无法解决的材料、人力、技术等问题都很快地得到了解决。最近这个厂的生产品种已由原来的全毛改为混纺，按先前计划是要增加一批工人的，由于推广了针梳机断头自停车装置，每个工人的看台能力由一台提高到二台，在不增加人的情况下，提高了生产。包装工段的工人们还进一步把拣线架发展成为拣线、打绞、压包、封口、打印、包装连成一条龙，使日产量由六千斤再跃到七千五百斤。6月24日，这个厂已经提前全面完成上半年计划。目前正在巩固、提高前一阶段技术革新成果的基础上，掀起一个新的革新高潮，争取下半年的更大跃进。
