Xinhua News Agency, June 9th, Johannesburg dispatch: Heroic struggles against the South African Federal authorities' system of racial persecution have been erupting continuously in the Pondoland African "Reserve" in the eastern Cape Province of South Africa for the past few weeks. Africans there are resisting the authorities' appointment of puppet chiefs.

On the 6th, hundreds of Africans in the Bizana, Flagstaff, and Lusikisiki areas of Pondoland put up a stubborn resistance against police who came to suppress them. According to reports, during the suppression, the police surrounded approximately three hundred Africans and dropped tear gas from airplanes and helicopters. Enraged African masses returned fire, hitting an aircraft.

In the resistance struggle on the 6th, South African authorities barbarously massacred and arrested many people. According to an announcement made by the South African Minister of Justice, Erasmus, on the 8th, six Africans were killed and twenty-one were arrested in this bloody incident.

On the 7th, demonstrations by Africans also broke out in the Transkei region. South African authorities' police, supported by airplanes and helicopters, once again carried out a brutal suppression of the demonstrators. It is reported that twenty-five people were killed and sixty were injured.

In order to strengthen the suppression, the South African Federal authorities also dispatched police forces from Durban to the Pondoland area. On the 8th, large numbers of police, supported by armored vehicles and police vehicles, patrolled large areas of Pondoland. Many South African police chiefs personally rushed to Pondoland to "inspect" the situation, and they also decided at a meeting to transfer backup troops and requested the South African Air Force to dispatch aircraft to assist in the suppression.

According to Durban's "Natal Mercury," this incident is the most serious since the Sharpeville incident in March this year, when South African authorities brutally suppressed African people's opposition to the "pass laws."

Xinhua News Agency, July 7th, Johannesburg dispatch: About three hundred students from the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa held a two-hour strike on the 6th to protest the South African authorities' dispatch of police to suppress the atrocities of student demonstrations.

On the 3rd, about two hundred students from this university held a demonstration in Johannesburg, holding up placards and demanding that the authorities release those arrested under the so-called "Emergency Regulations." The procession was blocked and suppressed by armed police on its way to the authorities' prison, and six students were arrested.

Since late March of this year, the South African authorities, in order to suppress the South African people's struggle against racial discrimination and for basic human rights, have arrested more than 18,000 people in various parts of South Africa. To date, thousands of people have not been released.

    新华社9日讯　约翰内斯堡消息：南非开普州东部庞多兰非洲人“保留地”在过去几个星期中不断爆发反对南非联邦当局种族迫害统治制度的英勇斗争。那里的非洲人纷纷反抗当局任命傀儡酋长。
    6日，在庞多兰的比扎纳、弗拉格斯塔弗和卢西基希地区的数百名非洲人对前往镇压的警察进行顽强的反抗。有消息说，在镇压中，警察把三百名左右的非洲人包围起来，并且从飞机和直升飞机投下催泪弹。愤怒的非洲群众开枪回击，打中了一架飞机。
    在6日的反抗斗争中，南非当局野蛮地屠杀和逮捕了许多人。据南非政府司法部长伊来斯马斯8日宣布，在这次流血事件中，有六名非洲人被打死，二十一人被捕。
    7日，特兰斯克地区也爆发了非洲人的示威运动。南非当局警察在飞机和直升飞机的支援下对示威者又进行了残酷的镇压。据报道，有二十五人被杀死，六十人被打伤。
    为了加强镇压，南非联邦当局还从德班向庞多兰地区增派警察部队。8日，大批警察在装甲车和警备车的支持下，在庞多兰的大片地区巡逻。南非当局的许多警察头子都亲自赶到庞多兰“视察”，他们还在一次会议上决定调去后援部队，并要求南非空军调派飞机协助镇压。
    据德班的“纳塔尔信使报”说，这次事件是今年3月间南非当局残酷镇压非洲人民反对“通行证法”的沙佩维尔事件以来最严重的事件。
    新华社7日讯　约翰内斯堡消息：南非联邦韦特瓦特斯兰德大学约三百名学生6日举行罢课两小时，抗议南非当局派遣警察镇压学生示威活动的暴行。
    3日，这个大学约二百名学生曾举着标语牌在约翰内斯堡举行示威游行，要求当局释放根据所谓“紧急状况条例”而逮捕的人。游行队伍在去当局监狱的途中，遇到武装警察的阻拦和镇压，并有六名学生被捕。
    自今年3月下旬以来，南非当局为了镇压南非人民反对种族歧视、争取基本人权的斗争，在南非各地逮捕了一万八千多人。到目前，还有上千的人没有被释放。
