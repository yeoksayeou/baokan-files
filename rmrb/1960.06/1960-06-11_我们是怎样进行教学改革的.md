    How We Conducted Teaching Reform
    Representative of Beiguan Primary School, Heishan County, Liaoning Province: Jia Guizhi
    Our school's teaching reform began in the autumn of 1958, and was carried out in the current second grade, classes one and two, and the first grade, classes one and two, which started this spring. The subjects mainly experimented with were Chinese and arithmetic. After more than a year of experimentation, we have initially gained some experience and achieved some results.

    Teaching Reform Has Achieved Good Results
    First, let's talk about the effects of teaching reform. Our second-grade pilot class, after three semesters and more than two months of study (the most significant reform being over seven months), has now reached the fourth-grade level in Chinese; arithmetic is also equivalent to the fourth-grade level. The first-grade pilot class, which started this spring, has completed the first-grade curriculum after more than two months of study. In March of this year, the Provincial Department of Education working group conducted a comparative test on our school's second-grade pilot class one and a fourth-grade class four from a neighboring county, using the same questions and the same evaluation standards. The results of the Chinese test showed that the students in our second-grade class one surpassed the level of the fourth-grade students in that elementary school in terms of literacy, dictation, reading, and composition. For example: in literacy, a total of 1,870 characters were tested, and the students in our second-grade class one averaged 1,715 characters, while the fourth-grade students in that elementary school averaged 1,427 characters; in dictation of 150 characters, the students in our second-grade class one averaged 141 characters, while the fourth-grade students in that elementary school averaged 93 characters; in reading, twelve students were randomly selected from each class (four each from the top, middle, and bottom of the class) to participate, and they were able to read fluently the lesson "Memories of School Life" from the fifth-grade Chinese textbook; ten students from our second-grade class one were able to retell the main idea of the text very well, compared to two students from the fourth grade in that elementary school; twenty-four students from our second-grade class one, accounting for 39.3% of the total number of test-takers, wrote compositions with rich content, ideological depth, and relatively complete plots, compared to ten students from the fourth grade in that elementary school, accounting for 24.3%. In the arithmetic test, the average score of our second-grade class one was 96.6 points, with no failures, while the average score of the fourth grade in that elementary school was 90.2 points, with two failures.

    Because students recognize more characters and have more knowledge, classroom teaching can no longer meet the children's requirements. They also read many books outside of class. Many students in our experimental class—second grade class one—read publications such as "New Young Pioneers," "Little Friends," "Red Children," and "Young Pioneers." More than ten students also read novellas and novels such as "My Family," "Eternal Life in the Flames," and "Tracks in the Snowy Forest." The children read more and gained more knowledge of life, so they demanded to express their feelings in writing. Thus, we broke the convention that first and second grade students do not write compositions, and we began to have the children write compositions in the first semester. Now the children in our pilot class can all write good short essays and diaries. They also like to express their feelings through poetry and painting. Some children can write a poem in three to five minutes. For example, little student Liu Yanrong (nine years old), at the request of a guest, wrote a poem on the theme of "Red Scarf" in five minutes:

    Red scarf, red and red,
    It's so glorious to wear it around my neck,
    Everyone competes for the red scarf,
    Striving for a full house of red in the whole class.

    Comrades from Dalian asked little student He Yukun (eight years old) to write a poem. She asked, "What should I write about?" One of the visiting comrades said, "This Teacher Chen is a model teacher in Dalian, so write a poem for him!" Little student He Yukun thought for a while and then wrote a poem:

    Teacher Chen is so capable,
    A model in Dalian,
    Came to Heishan to visit,
    The children really like you,
    Bringing knowledge and experience,
    Wishing your model deeds will never end.

    Recently, the second-grade experimental class, on the theme of "Leaping Forward Heishan," experimented with writing long articles. Eight students wrote more than 10,000 characters, and the whole class averaged more than 6,500 characters, writing with great substance.

    Because children read more books and participate in some social activities, their horizons are broadened, and they have more opportunities to be educated. Therefore, the communist ideological and moral character of the children in the experimental class grows rapidly. The thoughts and feelings of loving the Party, loving Chairman Mao, and loving socialism are deeply imprinted in the children's young minds, and they often reflect their feelings in their articles and poems. One little student wrote a poem praising the goodness of socialism:

    Socialism is good,
    The Communist Party leads,
    Happy flowers bloom everywhere,
    Down with the American imperialists, life is good.

    A visiting comrade talked to a little student. When they talked about how our happy life was brought by Chairman Mao, the little student compared it to saying, "Chairman Mao is like the sun." The visiting comrade jokingly asked, "What are you like?" He replied, "I am like a sunflower." Again he asked, "How are you like a sunflower?" He said, "The sunflower faces the sun, I want to always follow Chairman Mao, follow the Communist Party!" The children also especially love labor and the working people. For example, after the teacher taught the lesson "The People's Commune is Good," more than twenty little students automatically organized themselves to help the commune weed, and they were praised by the commune uncles. Communist virtues such as respecting teachers and elders, returning lost items, cherishing public property, and observing public order are also manifested in the children. According to the statistics of just one class for one semester, there were 422 instances of good deeds, and there were as many as 18 letters and big-character posters of praise from the community.

    In the past, the content and teaching methods of the teaching materials had shortcomings, which could not meet the requirements of students' intellectual development, and poor classroom discipline often occurred. Now, the teaching meets the children's learning requirements and gives play to their learning enthusiasm. Therefore, their listening comprehension is very concentrated, and discipline is also very good. The entire classroom is full of an atmosphere that is both tense and lively.

    The children learn more, is it a "too heavy burden"? It can be affirmed that the children's burden is not heavy. Because of the reform of teaching content and teaching methods, they basically digest the material in class, and the children do not have much homework outside of class. Parents generally report: The children get up between 6:00 and 6:30 in the morning. After returning home from school at around 4:00 in the afternoon, they mostly play games or help their parents with some chores. After dinner, they do about half an hour of self-study and go to bed before 8:00. Some parents even asked, "Should we ask them to learn more?" The children's health is also very good. A comprehensive physical examination was conducted not long ago, and the results proved that the children's development is completely normal.

    The situation of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 constantly put forward new requirements for school work. How to implement the spirit of the General Line in teaching and how to run education more, faster, better, and more economically was a prominent issue before us at that time. Some comrades at the time thought: "Why must elementary school be six years? Why can't the content of the elementary school curriculum be increased? Can't the school system be shortened?" Others said: "Comrade workers can walk ahead of time, and production doubles or increases tenfold. Why can't our teaching work leap forward?" At this time, the Heishan County Party Committee issued instructions to vigorously engage in teaching reform and decided to conduct pilot projects in our school, which greatly shocked all teachers and students in our school. Except for a few comrades who could not keep up with their thinking for a while and adopted a passive attitude, most comrades warmly responded to the call of the County Party Committee and resolutely stated that they must do a good job in the pilot class of our school. In this situation, our school took the first step in teaching reform.

    Several Experiences in Teaching Reform
    Teaching must be reformed. This is an issue that everyone has become increasingly clear about in the face of the compelling situation. However, how to reform? Where to start? At first, it was not clear. Later, the County Party Committee sent a working group and instructed us to start with investigation and research and learning from foreign experiences. This broke the deadlock. In order to specifically find out what problems exist in teaching and how to achieve high speed, we started to investigate and research from the children's ability to accept and the current teaching materials. From the investigation, we found that six- and seven-year-old children living in today's society already understand many things, have some life experiences, and can use many vocabularies. Most children can count more than one hundred numbers. Kindergarten children can also fully learn pinyin and recognize some characters. However, the first volume of elementary school textbooks only teaches 223 characters in one semester, and arithmetic only teaches addition and subtraction within twenty without carry-over or borrowing. This obviously cannot meet the requirements of children's intellectual development. After repeated research, everyone unanimously believed that there are many problems in Chinese teaching, and literacy is the biggest problem. New characters are a "stumbling block." If the literacy problem is not solved, it will affect reading and writing, and it will affect the learning of other subjects. But how to solve this problem? Under the enlightenment of the County Party Committee, we learned from the experience of Qitaizi Township in our county of using songs to teach characters and eliminating illiteracy at high speed, and combined with the characteristics of children, we compiled literacy textbooks using songs to teach characters and picture-based literacy methods. We conducted a concentrated literacy experiment in the first class of the first grade at that time, teaching a total of 317 characters in ten class hours. In order to test the effect, educate the masses, and boost morale, the County Party Committee organized more than 200 people, including office cadres, primary and secondary school teachers and students, and parent representatives, to hold an acceptance meeting with on-the-spot performances. According to the results of the acceptance, the good ones learned all the new characters, and the poor ones also learned 187 new characters, with an average of 276 characters per person, 53 more than all the new characters in the first volume of the Chinese textbook. According to the number of class hours, the efficiency was increased by 20 times. Under the influence and inspiration of the Chinese teaching reform experiment, and absorbing some characteristics of correspondence teaching materials, the "knowledge classification" and "intensive teaching and more practice" methods were adopted in the arithmetic teaching of the second class of the fourth grade, and the teaching task of one semester was basically completed in ten class hours.

    In the experimental process, we found an experience called "knowledge classification," but this experience was not recognized all at once. In the first Chinese experiment, although we used the method of "knowledge classification," we were not very clear about this experience in our minds. It was not until after the arithmetic experiment that it was clarified. In the past, some people underestimated children's ability to accept knowledge, overemphasized the principle of appropriateness, and forcibly broke up some complete knowledge with close internal connections into seven or eight pieces and taught them separately. For example, new Chinese characters are scattered in various texts, and only a few characters are taught in each lesson, scattered and scattered, and they are not completed until elementary school graduation or even junior high school. Students only master the characteristics of each character, but do not master the common rules of the characters. Of course, literacy progresses slowly and the effect is not high. Our experience of using "knowledge classification" is to concentrate knowledge with common properties and common characteristics in order to highlight its internal connections, enable students to master the rules of knowledge, and achieve drawing inferences from one instance and understanding by analogy. Although there are as many as 50,000 or 60,000 Chinese characters, each character is different, but there are mainly two types of character structure: one is a small number of basic characters, and the other is composite characters that account for more than 80% of Chinese characters (such as wood, white, and towel being basic characters, and cotton and board being composite characters). According to this characteristic of Chinese characters, as long as students are taught a certain number of radicals and basic characters, students can use these rules of character construction to recognize and write characters, and the speed will naturally be faster.

    Related to the experience of "knowledge classification," we advocate that "learning tasks should be realized step by step." In the past, teaching was to put several aspects of learning tasks together, without distinguishing priority, such as Chinese teaching, which mixed the knowledge of literacy, vocabulary, grammar, rhetoric, and reading together in articles; literacy was also like this, requiring "recognition, explanation, writing, and application to go hand in hand," and as a result, everything was required, and nothing could be completed well. We teach the basic knowledge of Chinese teaching and reading separately; literacy requires "four abilities to go step by step." When recognizing characters, students must be able to recognize, explain, and basically write; when reading and writing, they must be able to write and use. In this way, the learning tasks at each stage are clear, the key points are prominent, the energy is concentrated, and it is easy to achieve the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical.

    With the reform of teaching content, the teaching methods must also have corresponding reforms. In the past, in teaching, teachers lectured more and students practiced less. It was a "cramming" teaching method, which could not inspire and induce students' subjective initiative, so that the knowledge students learned could not be digested, consolidated, and learned to use through their own practice activities. According to the requirements of "knowledge classification" and "learning tasks to go step by step," we advocate "intensive teaching and more practice" in teaching methods. That is, teachers are required to explain the basic knowledge clearly and thoroughly, so that students fully understand, and then give play to students' ability to think independently, let students practice repeatedly, master the rules, and integrate the knowledge they have learned.

    In the teaching reform experiment, we also learned a point of experience, which is to "vigorously grasp students with poor grades to ensure a comprehensive leap forward." In the past, some teachers were influenced by the bourgeois "genius" educational thought and only cared about a few excellent students. Our education is different from bourgeois education. We want to ensure that all students learn well. Therefore, it is very necessary to vigorously grasp students with middle and lower grades, because the problems reflected in them often have typical significance. If guidance and correction can be given in time, the learning quality of all students can be improved and the polarization of students' grades can be avoided.

    In the process of teaching reform, the struggle between two ideologies and two paths is inevitable.
    Teaching reform is a continuation of the education revolution. If we want to make teaching meet the requirements of high speed and high quality, we must further deepen the implementation of the Party's educational policy of serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, and further open up broad roads for students to master scientific knowledge at high speed and high quality.

    Teaching reform is a major revolution on the education front. In the process of reform, the struggle between two ideologies and two paths is inevitable. The teaching reform in our school encountered opposition from people with right-leaning conservative ideas and those who held bourgeois educational ideas from the very beginning. They used the banner of the special theory of education, saying that "schools are not factories, people are not machines, and if it is done quickly, the quality cannot be guaranteed," saying that this is "a three-year-old baby carrying a burden, overestimating their ability," and arbitrarily predicted that the future would definitely be "drawing a tiger but ending up with a dog." In order to solve these ideological problems, under the leadership of the County Party Committee, we launched a mass movement to expose the large number of phenomena of less, slow, poor, and expensive in teaching work, and focused on criticizing the fallacy that school education is "special" and that teaching work cannot be more, faster, better, and more economical. This not only cleared the obstacles in the progress of teaching reform, but also helped everyone break superstitions, liberate their minds, and promote the communist style of daring to think and act, so that the mass teaching reform movement was rapidly launched in our school.

    With the deepening of the movement, the effect of teaching reform became more and more significant. Especially when our Chinese and arithmetic teaching reform was successful for the first time, it encouraged everyone's enthusiasm and strengthened the confidence in teaching reform. However, there were also a very few people who did not admit defeat, saying that this was "a duck on the stove, a fierce force," "Don't look at how much you learn now, you will forget it quickly in the future, and it will still be the same thing in the end." As soon as this cold wind emerged, the County Party Committee educated us to withstand the cold wind and continue the experiment, and introduced our experience and encouraged our enthusiasm at several education conferences. The first secretary of the County Party Committee expressed support for our experience at several County Party Committee plenary meetings, telling us not to be bound by old frameworks. As long as it is in line with the General Line and the education policy, teaching quickly and teaching well, we should dare to experiment and resolutely change, which was a great encouragement to us. Our teaching reform movement, in this way, under the strong leadership of the County Party Committee, went through repeated struggles, overcame numerous obstacles, and embarked on a healthy path of development.

    More than a year of experiments have proved that: teaching must be reformed, the current school system can be shortened, and teaching can be high-speed and high-quality. The requirements put forward by Minister Lu Dingyi of "appropriately shortening the length of schooling, appropriately improving the level, appropriately controlling class hours, and appropriately increasing labor" can be realized. According to the instructions of the County Party Committee, we are experimenting with the eight-year integrated system. Although the experiment has just begun and there is not much experience, we believe that under the leadership of the Party, good results will definitely be achieved.

    Comrades: Over the past year or so, we have done a little work in teaching reform, but it is still far from the requirements. The fact that we have been able to achieve a little success in our work is entirely the result of the Party's leadership and the strong support and assistance of relevant departments. The province and city often send working groups to help us, and the working group of the Institute of Psychology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences also gave us a lot of guidance. In particular, not long ago, the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee convened a teaching reform on-site meeting at our school. Some leaders of the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee came to our school and gave us many valuable instructions. Many brother schools also left us valuable opinions after visiting, which greatly encouraged us. It should be said that the experience of teaching reform in our school is a collective creation under the leadership of the Party and a crystallization of communist cooperation. These achievements belong to the Party and belong to the people. (Attached picture)

    我们是怎样进行教学改革的
    辽宁省黑山县北关小学代表　贾桂枝
    我校的教学改革，是从1958年秋季开始的，是在现在的二年一、二两班和今年春季始业的一年一、二两班进行的，试验的学科主要是语文、算术两科。经过一年多的试验，已初步取得一些经验和成绩。
    教学改革收到了很好的效果
    先谈谈教学改革收到的效果。我们二年级的试点班，经过三个学期零两个多月的学习（其中较大的改革，是七个多月），现在学生的语文已达到四年级程度；算术也相当于四年级程度。今年春季始业的一年级试点班，经过两个多月的学习，就学完了小学一年级的课程。今年3月，省教育厅工作组，对我校试点班二年一班和邻县一个小学的四年四班，用同一题目、同一评定标准进行了一次对比测验。语文测验的结果，我校二年一班学生的识字、听写、阅读和作文，都超过了那个小学四年级学生的水平。例如：识字，共测验一千八百七十个字，我校二年一班平均识一千七百一十五个字，那个小学四年级平均识一千四百二十七个字；听写一百五十个字，我校二年一班平均会写一百四十一个字，那个小学四年级平均会写九十三个字；阅读，两个班各抽十二名学生（成绩上中下各四名）参加，阅读五年级语文课本中“学校生活的回忆”一课，能读得流畅；能很好地复述课文大意的，我校二年一班有十人，那个小学四年级有二人；作文内容丰富，有思想性，情节比较完整的，我校二年一班有二十四人，占测验总人数的39．3％，那个小学四年级有十人，占24．3％。算术测验，我校二年一班平均成绩是九十六点六分，没有不及格的，那个小学四年级平均成绩是九十点二分，有二人不及格。
    由于学生认字多了，知识丰富了，课堂教学已满足不了孩子们的要求，他们在课外还阅读了许多读物，我们的试验班——二年一班很多同学都阅读了“新少年报”、“小朋友”、“红孩子”、“红领巾”等刊物。有十多名同学还阅读了“我的一家”、“在烈火中永生”、“林海雪原”等中篇、长篇小说。孩子们读书读的多了，生活知识多了，他们就要求用文字表达自己的心情，这样，我们就打破了一、二年级学生不作文的常规，在第一学期开始，就让孩子作文。现在我们试点班的孩子都能写很好的短文和日记了。他们还很喜欢用诗歌、绘画来表达自己的心情。有的孩子三至五分钟就写出了一首诗，如刘艳荣（九周岁）小同学，应客人的要求，以“红领巾”为题，五分钟写了一首诗：
    红领巾，红又红，系在脖子上真光荣，
    大家齐争红领巾，争取全班满堂红。
    旅大市参观同志，让贺玉坤（八周岁）小同学作首诗，她问“作什么题？”一位参观同志说：“这位陈老师是旅大市模范教师，你就给他作首诗吧！”贺玉坤小同学想了想，就作了一首诗：
    陈老师真能干，在大连是模范，
    到黑山来参观，小朋友真喜欢，
    带来知识和经验，祝你模范事迹永不断。
    最近，二年级试验班，以“跃进的黑山”为题，试验写长篇文章，有八名同学写了一万多字，全班平均写了六千五百多字，写的很有内容。
    由于孩子们阅读的书籍多了，又参加一些社会活动，眼界扩大了，受教育的机会多了。因而，试验班孩子们的共产主义思想品德成长的很快。热爱党、热爱毛主席、热爱社会主义的思想感情，深深地印在孩子们幼小的心灵里，并常常把他们的心情反映在自己的文章和诗歌里，有个小同学写了一首歌颂社会主义好的诗：
    社会主义好，共产党来领导，
    幸福花儿开遍了，打倒美帝生活好。
    有一位参观同志和一个小同学谈话，谈到我们的幸福生活是毛主席给带来的时候，这个小同学就比喻说：“毛主席像太阳”。参观同志打趣的问：“你像什么？”他回答说：“我像一棵向日葵。”又问：“你怎么像向日葵？”他说：“向日葵朝太阳，我要永远跟着毛主席、跟着共产党！”孩子们也特别热爱劳动和劳动人民，如当教师讲了“人民公社好”一课后，就有二十多名小同学，自动的组织起来，帮助公社去拔草，受到了公社叔叔们的表扬。尊师敬老、拾金不昧、爱护公共财物、遵守公共秩序等等共产主义品德，也在孩子们身上表现出来，仅就一个班一个学期的统计，好人好事就有四百二十二人次，受到社会上表扬的信件和大字报就有十八份之多。
    过去教材内容和教学方法有缺点，满足不了学生智力发展的要求，常常出现课堂纪律不好的现象，现在的教学满足了孩子们的学习要求，发挥了他们的学习积极性，因而听课精神非常集中，纪律也非常好，在整个课堂里都充满着又紧张又活泼的气氛。
    孩子们学的东西多了，是不是“负担太重了”呢？可以肯定的回答，孩子们的负担并不重。因为教学内容和教学方法的改革，基本上做到当堂消化，孩子们的课外作业是不多的。家长们普遍反映：孩子们都在早晨六点到六点半起床，下午四点多钟从学校回家后，大多是做游戏或帮助家长做点活，晚饭后进行半点钟左右时间的自习，在八点以前都睡觉了。有的家长还提出“是不是再叫他们多学一点？”孩子们健康情况也是很好的。不久前进行了一次全面的身体检查，检查结果证明孩子们的发育是完全正常的。
    1958年大跃进的形势，不断的为学校工作提出新的要求、在教学上怎样贯彻总路线的精神，怎样多快好省地办教育，是当时摆在我们面前的一个突出问题，有的同志，当时就想：“为什么小学一定要六年毕业？为什么小学课程内容不可以增多些？学制不可以缩短些？”也有的说：“工人同志能走在时间前边，生产成倍或十倍的增长，我们教学工作为什么不能跃进呢？”这时，黑山县委发出了大闹教学改革的指示，并决定在我校搞试点，这就大大震动了我校全体师生，除少数同志一时思想跟不上，抱着消极态度外，多数同志热烈响应县委的号召，坚决表示一定要把我校试点班工作搞好，就在这种情况下，我校迈进了教学改革的第一步。
      教学改革的几点经验
    教学必须改革，这是在形势逼人的情况下，使大家越来越明确的问题，但是，如何改？从哪里改起？开始还不清楚，后来，县委派了工作组，并指示我们首先要从调查研究、学习外地经验入手。这就打开了僵局。为了具体摸清教学当中究竟存在一些什么问题，怎样才能高速度？我们就从儿童的接受能力和现行的教材开始调查研究。从调查中发现生活在今天社会里的六、七岁儿童，他们已经懂得了许多事情，有了一些生活经验，已经会运用不少词汇，大多数儿童能数一百多个数。幼儿园大班孩子也完全可以学会拼音和识一些字。可是，小学的第一册课本，一个学期只教二百二十三个字，算术只教二十数以内不进位、不退位的加减法。这显然不能满足儿童智力发展的要求。经过反复研究，大家一致认为，语文教学中存在问题很多，而识字是其中最大的问题，生字是个“拦路虎”，识字问题不解决，就影响阅读和写作，就影响其他各科的学习。但怎样解决这一问题呢？在县委启发下，我们学习我县七台子乡以歌带字，高速度扫盲的经验，并结合儿童特点，用以歌带字和看图识字的办法，编写了识字课本，在当时的一年一班进行了集中识字的试验，共用十课时，教了三百一十七个字。县委为了检验效果，教育群众，鼓舞士气，组织了机关干部、中小学师生和家长代表二百余人，举行当堂表演的验收大会。验收结果，成绩好的学会了全部生字，成绩差的也学会了一百八十七个生字，平均每人识字二百七十六个，比第一册语文课本中全部生字还多五十三个，按授课时数算提高效率二十倍。在语文教学改革试验的影响和启发下，并吸收函授教材的某些特点，又在四年二班的算术教学上采用了“知识归类”和“精讲多练”的办法，用十课时，基本上完成了一学期的教学任务。
    我们在实验过程当中，摸到了一条经验，叫“知识归类”，但这条经验并不是一下子就认识到的，在第一次语文试验中，虽然我们用的就是“知识归类”的办法，但在思想上并不十分明确这一条经验。一直到算术试验之后才把它明确起来。过去有些人对儿童接受知识能力估计很低，过分强调量力性的原则，硬把一些完整的内在联系密切的知识，弄得七零八碎，分散开来教。如语文的生字，就是分散在各个课文里，每课只教几个字，离离拉拉的，一直拖到小学毕业以至初中才学完常用字，学生只是掌握了每个字的特点，而没掌握字的共同规律。这样识字当然进度慢，效果不高。我们运用“知识归类”的经验，就是把具有共同性质和共同特点的知识集中起来，以便突出其内在联系，使学生掌握知识的规律，做到举一反三，触类旁通。汉字虽有五、六万之多，一字一样，但字的结构主要有两种，一种是为数不多的基本字，一种是占汉字80％以上的合体字（如木、白、巾、是基本字，棉、板是合体字）。根据汉字这个特点，只要教给学生一定数量的偏旁部首和基本字，学生就可以根据这些构字的规律去识字、写字，速度自然也就快了。
    同“知识归类”这条经验相联系的，我们主张“学习任务要分步实现”。过去的教学，是把几方面的学习任务平摆在一起，不分先后主次，如语文教学，把识字、词汇、语法、修词和阅读等几个方面的知识，都混在文章里一起教；识字也是这样，要求“认、讲、写、用四会齐步走”，结果是什么都要求，什么都不能很好完成。我们把语文教学的基本知识和阅读分开教；识字是要求“四会分步走”，识字时要会认、会讲、基本上会写；阅读和写作时达到会写、会用。这样做，每个阶段的学习任务明确，重点突出，精力集中，容易实现多快好省的要求。
    随着教学内容的改革，教学方法也必须有相应的改革，过去在教学中，是教师讲的多，学生练的少，是“填鸭式”的教学方法，不能启发诱导学生的主观能动性，使学生所学的知识，不能通过自己的实践活动，得到消化、巩固和学会运用。我们根据“知识归类”和“学习任务分步走”的要求，在教学方法上主张“精讲多练”。就是要求教师将基本知识讲清楚、讲透彻，使学生完全理解，而后再发挥学生独立思考的能力，让学生反复练习，掌握规律，将所学的知识融汇贯通。
    在教学改革的试验中，我们还体会到一点经验，就是“狠抓成绩较差的学生，保证全面跃进”。过去有些教师受资产阶级“天才”教育思想的影响，只顾少数成绩优秀生。我们的教育同资产阶级教育不同，我们是要保证所有的学生都要学好。因此，狠抓学习成绩中、下等的学生是十分必要的，因为从他们身上反映出来的问题，往往有典型意义，若能及时予以指导、纠正，就可以提高全体学生的学习质量，避免学生成绩两极分化。
    在教学改革过程中，两种思想、两条道路的斗争是不可避免的
    教学改革是教育革命的继续。我们要使教学达到高速度、高质量的要求，就必须进一步深入地贯彻执行党的教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，进一步为学生高速度高质量地掌握科学知识开辟了广阔的道路。
    教学改革，是教育战线上的一个大革命，在改革的过程中，两种思想、两条道路的斗争是不可避免的。我们学校的教学改革，一开始就遇到了具有右倾保守思想和持有资产阶级教育思想的人的反对，他们打着教育特殊论的招牌，说什么“学校不是工厂，人不是机器，搞快了就不能保证质量，”说这是“三岁娃娃担担子，自不量力”，并武断地预测，将来一定是“画虎不成反类犬”。为了解决这些思想问题，我们在县委的领导下，开展了鸣放、辩论，发动教师揭露了教学工作中大量的少慢差费现象，并着重批判了学校教育“特殊论”和教学工作不能多快好省的谬论，这不仅扫清了教学改革前进中的障碍，而且帮助大家破除了迷信，解放了思想，发扬了敢想敢干的共产主义风格，使群众性的教学改革运动在我校迅速的开展起来了。
    随着运动的深入，教学改革的效果越来越显著，特别是当我们的语文、算术教学改革第一次试验成功时，更鼓舞了大家的干劲，坚定了教学改革的信心。但也有极少数人不认输，说这是“鸭子上锅台，一猛之劲”，“别看现在学的多，将来忘的也快，到头还是一回事”。这股冷风一露头，县委就教育我们要顶住冷风，继续试验，并在几次教育会议上，介绍我们的经验，鼓舞我们的干劲。县委第一书记在几次县委扩大会议上，都表示支持我们的经验，告诉我们不要受旧的框框束缚，只要符合总路线、教育方针，教得快、教得好，就要大胆的试验，坚决地改，这对我们的鼓舞是极大的。我们的教学改革运动，就是这样，在县委的坚强领导下，经过反复斗争，克服了重重阻碍，才走向了健康的发展道路。
    通过一年多试验证明：教学必须改革，现行学制可以缩短，教学可以高速度、高质量。陆定一部长提出的“适当缩短年限，适当提高程度，适当控制学时，适当增加劳动”的要求是可以实现的。我们根据县委指示，正在试验八年一贯制，试验虽然刚开始，经验还不多，但我们相信在党的领导下，是一定会取得良好效果的。
    同志们：一年多来，我们在教学改革中做了一点工作，但距离要求还差的很远。我们工作中能有一点成绩，完全是党的领导和有关部门的大力支持、帮助的结果。省、市经常派工作组帮助我们，中国科学院心理研究所工作组也给我们很多指导。特别是不久前中央和省委在我们学校召开了教学改革现场会，中央和省委的一些领导同志亲临我们学校，给了我们很多宝贵的指示，许多兄弟学校参观后，也给我们留下了可贵的意见，使我们受到了莫大的鼓舞。应该说，我们学校教学改革的经验，是党领导下的集体的创造，是共产主义大协作的结晶体。这些成绩是属于党、属于人民群众。（附图片）
