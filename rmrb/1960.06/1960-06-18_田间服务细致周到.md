During the busy summer harvest and planting season, the supply and marketing, finance, banking, medical, barber, shoe repair, and sewing personnel of the Xinjie Management Area of the Jincheng People's Commune in Jinning County, Yunnan, formed mobile service groups and mobile service stations, going deep into the fields to serve the commune members.

The service personnel, wherever they went in the fields, always carried boiled water, first-aid kits, and tools, repairing what was broken, patching what was torn, treating the sick, and doing whatever was beneficial to production. Commune member Li Shu of the Eighth Team wanted a haircut but was worried about not finishing watering the tobacco seedlings, so the service personnel took the initiative to help him water them, allowing him to get his haircut without worry. Commune member Yang Mo's shoes were already worn out, and he had wanted to take them to town for repair for some time, but he was too busy with transplanting rice seedlings. This time, when the shoe repair personnel helped him fix them, he said with emotion, "I've lived for over thirty years and have never seen anyone repairing shoes in the fields. You really think of everything for us!"

    田间服务细致周到
    在紧张的夏收夏种中，云南晋宁县晋城人民公社新街管理区的供销、财政、金融、医务、理发、补鞋、缝纫人员，共同组成了流动服务组和流动服务站，深入到田间为社员们服务。
    服务人员来到田间，不管到哪里，总是带着开水，背着保健箱，拿着工具，见坏就修，见破就补，见病就医，见有利于生产的事就干。八队社员李树要理发，但怕浇不完烟秧水，于是服务人员就主动帮助他浇，让他放心理发。社员杨莫的鞋已经穿破了，早就想拿到街上去补一下，可是栽秧紧，没有时间去。这回，补鞋人员帮他补好时，他感动地说：“我活了三十多年，还没有见过下田补鞋，你们怎么为我们想得这样周到啊！”
