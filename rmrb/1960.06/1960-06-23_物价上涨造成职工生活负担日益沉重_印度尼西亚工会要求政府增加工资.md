Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 19th: According to reports here, the National Council of the All-Indonesia Central Workers' Union sent a telegram to First Minister Djuanda on the 17th, requesting him to take swift measures, in accordance with the government's promise, to increase the salaries of state employees and workers by 25% and to increase their cost-of-living allowances.

The telegram stated that due to the continuous rise in the prices of daily necessities, the burden on state employees and workers is becoming increasingly heavy, especially in recent months.

Not long ago, Djono, the Secretary-General of the All-Indonesia Central Workers' Union, led a delegation from the union to meet with the Indonesian Minister of Labor and handed him a letter requesting him to increase the wages of workers in private enterprises by 25%. The letter pointed out that from 1957 to 1959, the price index for nineteen kinds of food increased by 73%, and in the first few months of 1960, prices rose even more sharply. By February of this year, the price index for nineteen kinds of food in Jakarta had increased by 363%.

According to Antara News Agency, recently, not only have the prices of daily necessities in many places soared, but they are also difficult to buy. In Jakarta, it has been difficult to buy daily necessities such as rice, sugar, kerosene, and cigarettes from "clothing and food stores" in the past two weeks. The price of kerosene, a major fuel, has also increased from one shield per bottle to two and a half shields. In Bandung and the surrounding areas, which produce vegetables, the price of potatoes per kilogram has doubled compared to six months ago, cabbage has increased fivefold, carrots have increased sixfold, and other vegetables have also increased by about onefold. According to Antara News Agency, one of the reasons for the increase in vegetable prices is that overseas Chinese are no longer growing vegetables. This is the result of the Indonesian authorities forcing overseas Chinese to leave the places where they grow vegetables.

These figures from the Indonesian Central Bureau of Statistics were cited by the "Indonesian Torch Newspaper" in a recent editorial.

    物价上涨造成职工生活负担日益沉重
    印度尼西亚工会要求政府增加工资
    据新华社雅加达19日电　据这里报纸报道，全印度尼西亚中央职工会全国理事会在17日打电报给第一部长朱安达，要求他根据政府的诺言，迅速采取措施，把国家雇员和工人的工资提高25％，并且增加他们的生活津贴。
    电报说，由于日用必需品的价格不断上涨，国家雇员和工人的负担愈来愈重，在最近几个月中更是如此。
    不久以前，全印度尼西亚中央职工会总书记约诺率领这个工会的代表团会晤了印度尼西亚劳工部长，并交给他一封信，要求他把私人企业工人的工资增加25％。信中指出，从1957年到1959年，十九种食物的价格指数增加了73％，而在1960年头几个月，价格上涨更猛。到今年2月，雅加达的十九种食物的价格指数增加了363％。
    据安塔拉通讯社消息，最近许多地方的日用必需品不仅价格猛涨，而且很难买到。在雅加达，过去两星期中就不容易从“衣食商店”中买到大米、食糖、煤油、香烟等日用必需品。主要燃料煤油的价格也从每瓶一盾增加到两盾半。在产蔬菜的万隆和万隆附近的地区，如果同半年前相比，每公斤马铃薯的价格上涨了一倍，洋白菜上涨了五倍，胡萝卜上涨了六倍，其他蔬菜也上涨了一倍左右。据安塔拉通讯社说，蔬菜价格上涨的原因之一是华侨不再种蔬菜了。这是印度尼西亚有关当局迫使华侨离开他们种菜的地方所造成的结果。
    印度尼西亚中央统计局的这些数字是“印度尼西亚火炬报”在最近发表的社论中引用的。
