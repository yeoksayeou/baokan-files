Listen to the Voice of the Chinese People's Steel
Yang Shuo

The Taiwan Strait has always been a place of strong winds and waves, with turbulent tides. Eisenhower knew this, but he never expected to encounter such a great risk this time, almost being swept into the Pacific Ocean by the raging waves. Look, the seawater stood up like a mountain, a thick black smoke filled the strait, and the air vibrated with such a terrible sound. It turned out that the Chinese people had specially arranged a grand ceremony for him to "welcome" him to "grace" Taiwan with his presence.

The Chinese people are the most courteous. When you come, we greet you with cannons; when you leave, we won't forget to send you off with cannons. The "farewell" salute was so intense. It was as if it was directly hitting Eisenhower's behind, blasting him head over heels out of Taiwan.

This pirate chieftain meticulously planned a wonderfully exciting program for his "goodwill visit" to the Far East. He believed that he would reign over the Far East like a world-conquering emperor, receiving flowers and smiles everywhere. Eisenhower absolutely did not expect things to go so badly. In the Philippines, in Okinawa, in South Korea, he was met with setbacks everywhere. This was not all; what annoyed him most was Japan, and what terrified him most was the Chinese people.

The planned visit to Japan was supposed to be the high point of his trip. There, he intended to use the Earth as a golf ball and play a game with that old dwarf Nobusuke Kishi. But the Japanese people were dead set against him. Although Nobusuke Kishi inherited the mantle of Hitler's ghost and used fascist methods to carry out bloody suppression of the Japanese people, the result was like adding fuel to the fire, arousing the Japanese people to even more heroic struggles: protests, demonstrations, strikes, boycotts, opposing Eisenhower's visit to Japan, opposing the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty"... The momentum was so great that it finally overthrew the traitorous Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi. As for this "plague god," he saw the situation early and dejectedly canceled his visit to Japan, thus avoiding the fate of his "advance man" Hagerty. This incident naturally made him and the U.S. government lose face and reputation, but what could he do? Even if he had great courage, he would not be willing to risk his old life by going to the mouth of a volcano.

In Taiwan, he was truly haunted by uneasiness. The storm-like cannon fire from mainland China shook the land beneath his feet. These were not cannons; this was simply the earth-shaking roar of the Chinese people. Every shot was pointing at Eisenhower, rebuking him, every shot was directing a contemptuous sneer at his ears.

The American pirates, relying on the Seventh Fleet, have forcibly occupied China's territory of Taiwan for a full ten years now. They say that Taiwan is the "unsinkable aircraft carrier" of the United States in the Pacific, using it as a springboard to launch new wars of aggression, to be enemies with the Chinese people, to be enemies with the Asian people. Little do they know that this "unsinkable aircraft carrier" is a deadly noose, trapping the American pirates so that they cannot escape. When Eisenhower dragged his two blood-stained, stinking feet onto Taiwan, as soon as he poked his head out, his thin and long neck went into the noose. The Chinese people gently pulled the rope, strangling Eisenhower so that he couldn't breathe, almost suffocating him to death.

Now, although Eisenhower has fortunately escaped from the Far East and slipped back to his old nest on the east coast of the Pacific, he will never escape the cannon fire of the Chinese people. That cannon fire is the roar of the Chinese people, and every roar of the Chinese people is like a cannonball hitting Eisenhower's brain. The sound of cannons and roars are connected as one, bombarding American imperialism together, bombarding, bombarding until we liberate our own territory of Taiwan.

This huge sound is also shaking the entire world. The Philippines, South Korea, Japan, and every corner of the world, how could they not hear it? This sound has given the people of all countries great support, given them powerful encouragement, and made them even more confident in their struggle. The people of Asia and the whole world understand that this not only demonstrates the powerful strength of the Chinese people, but also demonstrates the powerful and unparalleled strength of the entire world's people against American imperialism. For a beastly wolf like American imperialism, it does not understand human language; please listen to the voice of the Chinese people's steel.

    请听听中国人民钢铁的声音吧
    杨朔
    台湾海峡向来多风多浪，波涛汹涌。艾森豪威尔知道这点，可万万料想不到这次竟会遭到那么大的风险，差点儿叫惊涛骇浪把他卷进太平洋里去。瞧啊，海水像山似的立起来，海峡上弥漫着一片浓黑的烟雾，而空中又震动着多么可怕的声音啊。却原来是中国人民特意为他安排好的隆重仪式，“迎接”他“光临”台湾。
    中国人民是最讲礼节的。你来的时候，用大炮迎你；你走的时候，也不会忘记用大炮送你。“欢送”的礼炮又是那么激烈。简直好像直轰到艾森豪威尔的后屁股上，轰得他翻斤斗滚出台湾去。
    这个海盗头子这次到远东来做“亲善访问”，事先煞费苦心，安排妥当一个精彩无比的节目。他认为自己将会像一个征服世界的天王似的君临远东，到处接受的将是鲜花和笑脸。艾森豪威尔绝对没想到事情竟会糟到这步田地。在菲律宾、在冲绳岛、在南朝鲜，处处碰壁。这还不算，顶叫他懊恼的是日本，顶叫他胆颤心惊的就是中国人民了。
    预定在日本的访问，本来应该是他这次出行的高峰。在那里，他准备拿着地球当高尔夫球，跟那个老侏儒岸信介玩上一场球赛。日本人民却偏偏跟他做死对头。尽管岸信介从希特勒的阴魂得到亲传的衣钵，使用法西斯手段对日本人民进行了血腥的镇压，结果竟像火上加油，激起日本人民更英勇的斗争：抗议、示威、罢工、罢市，反对他艾森豪威尔到日本去访问，反对日美新“安全条约”……声势那样壮大，最后到底推翻了那个卖国首相岸信介。至于这个“瘟神”呢，还算他见机的早，垂头丧气地取消了访问日本的计划，才没遭到他的“先行官”哈格蒂一样的命运。这件事自然弄得他和美国政府丢人现眼，声誉扫地，可是又有什么法儿呢？就是他有天大的胆子，他也不愿意拿着自己的老命到火山口上去冒险。
    在台湾，真弄得他有点儿魂梦不安。从中国大陆上发出的那狂风暴雨般的炮火，把他脚下的土地都震得乱颤。这不是炮，这简直是中国人民发出的山摇地动的怒吼。每一发炮都在指着鼻子斥责他艾森豪威尔，每一发炮都在对着他的耳朵发出鄙视的冷笑。
    美国海盗仗着第七舰队强占了中国的领土台湾，到现在已经整整十年了。说什么台湾是美国在太平洋上“不沉的航空母舰”，拿着它当跳板，准备发动新的侵略战争，跟中国人民为敌，跟亚洲人民为敌。殊不知这只“不沉的航空母舰”竟是个要命的大套索，套得美国海盗脱身不得。当艾森豪威尔拖着两只沾满血污的臭脚，踏上台湾，刚一伸头，他那又细又长的脖颈子就伸进套索里去。中国人民把绳子扣儿只那么轻轻一拉，就勒得艾森豪威尔透不过气来，差一点憋死。
    现在艾森豪威尔虽然侥幸从远东逃脱，溜回他在太平洋东岸的老巢，他却永远也逃不脱中国人民的炮火。那炮火就是中国人民的吼声，中国人民的每一声怒吼也像炮弹似的照直击中艾森豪威尔的脑顶心。炮声和吼声连成一片，一齐向美帝国主义轰着，轰着，一直要轰到我们解放自己祖国的领土台湾。
    这种巨大的响声也在震动着整个世界。菲律宾、南朝鲜、日本、以及世界的每个角落，哪儿会听不见呢？这响声给了各国人民莫大的支持，给了他们有力的鼓舞，使他们更加信心百倍地战斗着。亚洲和全世界人民都懂得，这不仅表现出中国人民强大的力量，更表现出整个世界人民反对美帝国主义的强大无比的力量。对于像美帝国主义这样人面兽心的野心狼，说人话他是不懂得的，请听听中国人民钢铁的声音吧。
