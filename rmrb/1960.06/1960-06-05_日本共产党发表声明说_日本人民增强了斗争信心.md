The Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on the 4th, saying: "The (Japanese) working class and the people have victoriously conducted today's struggle (including strikes), thus generating tremendous confidence in their own strength."

The statement pointed out that the people strengthened their unity in the past year's struggle against the "Security Treaty," which is an important factor in the great victory of the June 4th struggle.

The Japanese Communist Party announced in the statement: "Based on the achievements already made, the working class and all the Japanese people will continue to take strong actions such as strikes, demonstrations, rallies, and launching signature campaigns until the Kishi Nobusuke government is overthrown, the Diet is dissolved, the (Japan-U.S.) military treaty is smashed, and Eisenhower's visit is canceled."
