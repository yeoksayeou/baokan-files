    The Blossoms of the Cultural Revolution in Ethnic Minority Areas
    By our reporters Pan Di and Yu Changqin
    In the grand venue of the National Congress of Advanced Units in Culture and Education, we saw many men and women dressed in colorful ethnic costumes. They were representatives from thirty-three ethnic minority groups from all over the country. Not long ago, the vast majority of them had no connection with culture at all. Today, under the Party's meticulous care and cultivation, they have become the pioneers of the cultural revolution of all ethnic groups, and have become magnificent blossoms of the cultural revolution in the vast ethnic minority areas.
                Five Chalk Sticks to Start a School
    If no one introduced him, no one would guess that Xiong Shigao, the representative from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, is a beloved teacher; one would think he was an ordinary farmer. He was originally a liberated farmer. In March 1956, the Party sent him to study at the Guangxi Nationalities Institute. His classmates all had a primary school education, but he, a Miao boy from a place that did not even have its own written language, had to start from one, two, three... With the Party's constant encouragement and the enthusiastic help of his classmates, he tenaciously learned more than three thousand six hundred Chinese characters in just over a year. When he returned to his remote mountainous hometown of Longlin County, he was determined to contribute what he had learned to his fellow villagers in this mountain village where not a single person could read. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, with the help of the Party organization and the villagers who were eager to be liberated culturally, he built a classroom himself in four days. But when the fifth day came to start classes, there were no stationery supplies at all. He ran to the complete primary school twenty miles away, borrowed five chalk sticks, and copied the primary school textbooks onto a piece of paper, and that's how the first lesson began. There were three ethnic groups among the students: Miao, Zhuang, and Han. He had to repeatedly explain one word in three ethnic languages until every student understood it. The students lived scattered and the younger ones did not know the way, and often encountered wild animals when crossing the mountains, so to ensure the students' safety, he picked up the students every morning and personally escorted them home after school. The students did not have textbooks, so he copied the textbooks for the students during breaks, lunch breaks, and at night. He was a teacher and also a school worker. He did everything himself: boiling water, chopping firewood… Xiong Shigao wholeheartedly mobilized all the school-age children scattered in the three remote mountain villages to attend school. Now, this school, started with five chalk sticks, has developed into three classes with a total of twenty-six students.
            Past Serf, Today's Teacher
    Below the huge portrait of Chairman Mao on the rostrum sat a girl dressed in a dazzling red ethnic costume. She is Zaxi Zhuoma, a teacher at the Xigaze Primary School in Tibet. This daughter of a serf, because her parents could no longer bear to let her be a slave for the nobles, was sent to a monastery at the age of thirteen to become a nun—in reality, to do slave-like work. After five or six years of a miserable life in the monastery, she boldly escaped from the monastery in 1954 and went to the youth and women's federation to register for school. Since then, under the Party's cultivation and the help of Han comrades, Zaxi Zhuoma overcame difficulties and studied diligently, and gradually grew from an illiterate and ignorant girl into a revolutionary people's teacher.
    In the Tibetan region, many serfs and slaves like Zaxi Zhuoma bravely broke free from the reactionary rule of the feudal serf system and gradually grew into cultured and conscious people, contributing their strength to the development of cultural undertakings in the Tibetan region. Qimi, who had been a slave for three generations, is now one of the three hundred and eighty Tibetan projectionists. Before liberation, she had never seen a movie, let alone projected one. Now, under the leadership of the Party, they overcame the difficulty of not knowing Chinese, finally mastered the technology, and became excellent projectionists.
    These yesterday's serfs have become the masters of the country today, the masters of culture. They have come to the capital of the great motherland to participate in the National Congress of Advanced Units in Culture and Education. They all said with joy that they thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and thank the Han brothers and brothers of all ethnic groups who enthusiastically helped the Tibetan people to be liberated.
                Both a Troupe and a Propaganda Team
    One night in November 1958, in the Yongning Zhengjiatai Agricultural Cooperative in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, a theatrical troupe was performing for the peasant masses. Just two hours after the start of the performance, a northwest wind suddenly blew, and snowflakes began to fall. The carbide lamp was blown dim, and the actors' beards and gauze hats were blown off. However, the masses were reluctant to leave, so the actors insisted on finishing the performance, satisfying the needs of the masses. Once, when this troupe was performing in Jingui Township, just as the performance was about to begin, they suddenly heard that the canal embankment had broken. The actors, disregarding their costumes, immediately joined the masses to plug the gap, and promptly protected more than fifty mu of wheat.
    This troupe, which resolutely implements the Party's literary and artistic policies, is the Ningshuo Qin Opera Troupe, deeply loved by the masses in various parts of Ningxia. Since the autumn of 1955, they have spent more than 85% of their time going up mountains and down to the countryside, going deep among the workers and peasants, bringing plays to the fields, construction sites, mines, canteens, and hospital wards. They performed for the workers and peasants and traveled tens of thousands of miles. In their performances, regardless of high mountains or long distances, regardless of cold or hot weather, or wind or rain, they went wherever the masses needed them. Even if they moved a little every three days, changed places every two days, and dismantled and set up a stage every day, they never complained or were afraid of trouble. When performing, regardless of whether the stage was large or small, whether it was an earthen stage, a square, or steps, a hillside, or a courtyard, they performed the same way and never cared about the conditions. Before each performance, they always took half an hour to publicize the Party's policies and guidelines in various periods, taking it as a regular task, promoting the construction of ethnic minority areas, and educating the masses, which was loved by the people.
              Both Red and Expert White-Clad Soldiers
    During the National Congress of Advanced Units in Culture and Education, Li Dequan, Vice-Chairman of the National Women's Federation and Minister of the Central Ministry of Health, met with Aijiaer, a health representative from the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Aijiaer is a doctor at the Friendship Hospital in Urumqi. She has always treated patients like her own relatives. Some patients could not be hospitalized due to objective conditions, so she helped them set up family sickbeds and used her spare time to treat patients at their homes. One day, a patient's family member came to the hospital to ask Dr. Aijiaer to see a patient at home. She didn't have time during the day, so after getting off work in the evening, she ran to the patient's home without eating. But because it was dark, she couldn't find the patient's address for a long time. The next morning, as soon as it was light, she found the patient's home and found that it was a seriously ill patient with heart disease and pneumonia, who had to be hospitalized immediately to save her life. She and the patient's husband carried the patient to the hospital, took emergency treatment, and cured the patient. The patient's husband said gratefully: "If it were in the old society, my wife would have died long ago." Although Aijiaer could not speak a word of Chinese, she has now learned Chinese and can see Han patients alone. Due to her continuous progress in politics and professional skills, she has become a glorious Communist Party member this year.
          Let Advanced Seeds Be Sown Throughout Ethnic Minority Areas
    In the seat of the presidium of the congress, there was a middle-aged woman wearing a Mongolian robe. Her simple and honest face has been filled with excited smiles these days. The first sentence of her speech at the congress was: "I am extremely excited to participate in the National Congress of Advanced Units in Culture and Education, and I can't suppress the joy in my heart!"
    How could she not be excited! This Mongolian woman, Jin Zhong, who was forcibly occupied as a slave by a local tyrant herder at the age of twelve, was rescued from the tiger's mouth by the Party when the grassland was liberated, and was trained to become a health worker. At first, she was illiterate, and it was very difficult to learn culture and professional skills at the same time. However, under the Party's encouragement and the teacher's patient education, no difficulty stopped her. At night, when others were sleeping, she was still in bed, using a flashlight to write down one word at a time. In 1953, she returned to the grassland of Urad Front Banner, her hometown, from Hohhot, the capital of the autonomous region, with the knowledge of maternal and child health care she had just learned, and worked tirelessly for the prosperity of the Mongolian population. In the past seven years, she has taught her knowledge to more than one hundred activists in maternal and child health care. In 1958, she came to the Aoribugehuoshuo People's Commune. With the support of the commune Party committee, she mobilized the masses to contribute ideas and efforts, and self-reliantly established a maternity hospital with twenty beds. In January of this year, a young pregnant woman had dystocia. After many twists and turns, the baby finally left the mother's body, but the baby's mouth and nose were filled with dirty blood and amniotic fluid, and it was about to suffocate and die. The maternity hospital did not have a suction device. When everyone was at a loss, Jin Zhong did not hesitate to put her mouth to the child's mouth and sucked out the dirty blood and amniotic fluid, mouthful by mouthful. It was with such selfless spirit that she contributed all her wisdom and strength to the cause of maternal and child health care, and thus won the love of the broad masses on the grassland.

    民族地区文化革命的花朵
    本报记者　潘荻　于长钦
    在全国文教群英会的大会场里，我们看到许多身着各色民族服装的男女，他们是来自各地三十三个少数民族的代表。不久以前，他们当中的绝大多数人和文化还是完全无缘的。在党的无微不至的关怀和培育下，今天，他们已成为各兄弟民族文化革命的开路先锋，已成为广阔的民族地区文化革命的瑰丽花朵。
                五支粉笔办学校
    广西僮族自治区的代表熊仕高，如果没有人介绍，谁也猜不着他会是一位受人爱戴的教师，还以为他是一个普通的农民呢。他原来就是翻身农民。1956年3月，党送他到广西民族学院去学习，和他同班的同学都有高小的文化程度，而他这个来自连本民族文字都没有的苗族子弟，却要从一二三……学起。在党的不断鼓励和同学们的热情帮助下，他顽强地在一年多的时间里，学会了三千六百多个汉字。当他回到边远的山区隆林县自己的家乡时，决心把自己学到的文化，贡献给这个原来连一个识字的人都没有的山乡同胞。1958年大跃进中，他在党组织和迫切要求在文化上翻身的乡亲们的帮助下，自己动手，四天盖起了一间教室，可是当第五天要开课时，一切文具都没有。他就跑到二十里路以外的完全小学去，借了五支粉笔，用一张纸抄了小学生的课文，就这样开始了第一课。学生中有苗、僮、汉三种民族，一个字，他也要连续用三种民族语言反复讲解，直到每个学生都懂得为止。学生居住分散，年岁小的不认得路，而且翻山越岭常碰到野兽，为保证学生安全，他每天早晨都接学生上学，放学后又亲自送学生回家。学生们没有课本，他就在下课、午休和夜里给学生们抄课文。他是老师，也是校工。烧水、劈柴……样样勤务杂工，他都自己干。在教课中，他常常遇到连自己也不认识的生字，有时为了一两个字，他连夜赶到二十里以外的完全小学去请教，第二天把自己刚学会的字再教给学生。熊仕高，就这样全心全意地将分散在偏僻山区三个寨子的学龄儿童，全部动员来入学。现在，这个由五支粉笔办起来的学校，已经发展成三个班，共有二十六名学生。
            过去的农奴今日的教师
    主席台上毛主席的巨幅画像的下面，坐着一个身着鲜艳夺目的红色民族服装的姑娘。她就是西藏日喀则小学的教师扎西卓玛。这个农奴的女儿，由于父母不忍心再让她给贵族当奴隶，十三岁那年就被送进了寺院去当尼姑——实际上也是干奴隶一般的活。在寺院过了五、六年悲惨生活，1954年她才大胆地从寺院逃出来，跑到青年、妇女联合会去报名上学。从此，扎西卓玛在党的培养和汉族同志的帮助下，克服困难，刻苦学习，由一个字不识、一无所知的女孩子，逐渐成长为一个革命的人民教师。
    在西藏地区，许许多多像扎西卓玛一样的农奴和奴隶勇敢地挣脱了封建农奴制度的反动统治，逐渐成长为有文化有觉悟的人，对发展西藏地区的文化事业贡献着自己的力量。三代当奴隶的其米，现在已是三百八十名藏族放映员中的一个。翻身以前，她从来也没看到过电影，更谈不上放映电影了。如今，她（他）们在党的领导下，克服不谙汉语的困难，终于掌握了技术，成为优秀的放映员。
    这些昨日的农奴，今天成了国家的主人，成了文化的主人，他们来到了伟大祖国的首都，参加文教群英会。他们都喜不自胜地说，感谢共产党和毛主席，感谢热情帮助我们西藏人民翻身的汉族兄弟和各民族兄弟。
                是剧团又是宣传队
    1958年11月的一个夜晚，宁夏回族自治区的永宁郑家台农业社里，有一个剧团正在为农民群众演出。刚开演两个多小时，忽然刮起了西北风，飘起雪花来。汽灯被刮得半明半暗，演员的胡须、纱帽也被刮掉了。可是群众恋恋不肯散去，演员们也就坚持演完，满足了群众的要求。又是这个剧团，有一次在金贵乡演出时，刚要开演，忽然听到渠坝开口，演员们顾不得下装，立刻和群众一道去堵缺口，及时保护了五十多亩小麦。
    这个坚决贯彻党的文艺方针的剧团，就是深受宁夏各地群众喜爱的宁朔秦剧团。他们自1955年秋以来，有85％以上的时间是上山、下乡，深入工农群众，把戏送到田间、工地、矿山、食堂和病房。他们为工农群众演出，走了上万里的路程。在演出中，不管山高路远，不论天冷天热或刮风下雨，只要哪里群众需要，他们就到哪里去。就是三天挪一点，两天换一处，一天拆一台搭一台，都从不叫苦，不怕麻烦。在演出时，不管台大台小，是土台、广场，还是台阶、山坡、院落，他们都照样演出，从不计较条件。每次开演前，他们总还要利用半小时，宣传党在各个时期的方针政策，把它作为经常的工作任务，推动了民族地区的建设事业，教育了群众，受到了人民群众的热爱。
              又红又专的白衣战士
    在文教群英会期间，全国民主妇联副主席、中央卫生部部长李德全接见了来自新疆维吾尔自治区的卫生代表阿加尔。阿加尔是乌鲁木齐市友谊医院的医生。她一贯把病人当作亲人一样看待。有些病人因客观条件不能住院，她就帮助病人建起家庭病床，并利用休息时间到病人家中去治疗。有一天，一个病人家属来医院请阿大夫去家里看病。白天没时间，到晚上下班后，她不吃饭就往病人家跑。但因天黑，找了好久也找不到病人的住址。第二天天一亮，她才找到病人家，发现这是一个患心脏病并发肺炎的重病人，必须马上住院才能挽救生命。她便和病人的丈夫一道，把病人抬到医院，采取紧急治疗，治好了这个病人。病人的丈夫感激地说：“如果是旧社会，我老婆早没命了。”阿加尔虽然一句汉语也不会说，现在她已学会汉语可以单独给汉族病人看病了。由于她在政治、业务等方面的不断进步，今年她已成为一个光荣的共产党员。
          让先进的种籽撒遍民族地区
    在大会主席团的席位上，有一位穿着蒙古族长袍的中年妇女，她那纯朴忠厚的脸上，这些天来总是堆满兴奋的笑容。她在大会上的发言头一句话就是：“我参加全国文教群英会，万分激动，压不住内心的高兴！”
    她怎么能不激动呢！这个十二岁就被恶霸牧主强占作奴隶的蒙古族妇女——金钟，直到草原解放时，党才把她从虎口里救了出来，并且培养成为保健员。开始，她是个文盲，要学文化，同时又学业务，困难很大。但是她在党的鼓励下和老师的耐心教育下，一切困难都没有挡住她。夜里，别人睡觉了，她还在被窝里用手电筒照着一个字一个字的记下来。1953年，她从自治区首府呼和浩特带着刚学到的妇幼保健工作知识，回到自己的家乡乌拉特前旗的草原上，为蒙古族人口的兴旺而孜孜不倦地工作。七年来，她把自己的知识，先后传授给一百多名妇幼保健工作的积极分子。1958年，她来到了奥日布格胡硕人民公社，在公社党委的支持下，发动群众献策献计，自力更生地办起了有二十张床位的妇产院。今年1月间，有一位青年孕妇发生难产，经过许多周折，婴儿才脱离母体，但是婴儿的嘴鼻都灌满了污血和羊水，眼看就要窒息而死。妇产院没有吸出器，在大家束手无策的时候，金钟毫不犹豫地将自己的嘴对着孩子的嘴，一口一口地把污血和羊水吸了出来。她就是用这样忘我的精神，把自己的一切智慧和力量贡献给妇幼保健事业，因而博得了草原上广大群众的热爱。（附图片）
