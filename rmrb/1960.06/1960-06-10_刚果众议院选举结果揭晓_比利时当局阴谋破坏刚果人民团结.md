Xinhua News Agency, Leopoldville, June 6th: The results of the first House of Representatives election in the Belgian Congo have been announced.

It is announced that the Lumumba faction of the Congolese National Movement Party and its alliance won 41 of the total 137 seats, the African Solidarity Party won 13 seats, and the ABAKO Party won 12 seats. The African Solidarity Center won 10 seats, the Kalonji faction of the Congolese National Movement Party won 8 seats, the Congolese National Progress Party and the CONAKAT Party won 21 and 8 seats respectively, and other Congolese political groups and individuals won 24 seats.

It is reported that the election started on May 11 and lasted for more than ten days. At the same time, provincial council elections were also held in the six provinces of the Congo.

According to the resolution of the round table conference on the future of the Congo held in Brussels earlier this year, the Congo will declare its independence on June 30 this year, and the first Congolese government will be established on June 20, with candidates appointed by the King of Belgium. Provincial council, House of Representatives, and Senate elections were held in May and June respectively; the House of Representatives is composed of 137 members elected by election, and the Senate is composed of 14 members designated by each of the six provincial councils. The elections were conducted under the "supervision" of the Belgian colonial authorities. It is reported that in recent months, the Belgian colonial authorities have intensified various conspiracies in the Congo, constantly creating tribal antagonism and conflicts, taking the opportunity to carry out military repression, and using this to split the unity of the Congolese people. At the same time, the colonial authorities have also constantly used various bribery methods and techniques to help establish and develop various political organizations that serve them, and support them materially. The Congolese nationalist parties have accused the colonial authorities of supporting the behavior of the National Progress Party. As early as during the Congolese political round table conference, the Belgian monopoly groups instigated the representatives of the CONAKAT Party in Katanga to conspire to split the richest Katanga province from the Congo, which was opposed by the representatives of the Congolese nationalist parties at the time.

    刚果众议院选举结果揭晓
    比利时当局阴谋破坏刚果人民团结
    新华社6日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：比属刚果第一次众议院选举结果已经揭晓。
    据宣布，刚果民族运动党卢蒙巴派和它的联盟获得全部议席一百三十七席中的四十一席，非洲团结党获得十三席，阿巴科党获得十二席。非洲团结中心获得十席，刚果民族运动党卡隆吉派获得八席，刚果民族进步党和科纳卡党分别获得二十一席和八席，其他刚果政治集团和个人获得二十四席。
    据报道，选举从5月11日开始，共进行了十多天。在这同时，还在刚果六个省举行了省议会选举。
    根据今年初在布鲁塞尔举行的刚果政治前途问题圆桌会议的决议，刚果于今年6月30日宣布独立，第一届刚果政府在6月20日成立，人选由比利时国王任命。5月和6月分别举行省议会和众议院以及参议院选举；众议院由选举产生的一百三十七名议员组成，参议院由六个省议会各指定十四名成员组成。选举是在比利时殖民当局“监督”下进行的。据报道，比利时殖民当局近几个月来加紧在刚果进行各种阴谋活动，不断制造部族对立和冲突事件，乘机进行军事镇压，并借此分裂刚果人民的团结。同时，殖民当局还不断使用种种贿赂手段和手法，帮助建立和发展为它服务的各种政治组织，在物质上支持它们。刚果的民族主义政党曾经指责殖民当局支持民族进步党的行为。早在刚果政治圆桌会议期间，比利时垄断集团曾唆使加丹加的科纳卡党的代表阴谋把最富饶的加丹加省从刚果分裂出去，当时遭到刚果民族主义政党代表的反对。
