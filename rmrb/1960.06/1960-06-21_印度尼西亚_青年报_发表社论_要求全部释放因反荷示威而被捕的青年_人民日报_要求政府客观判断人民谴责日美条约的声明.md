Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 18th: The Indonesian "Youth Daily" published an editorial on June 16th demanding the release of all university students and youths arrested for participating in demonstrations against Dutch military provocations.

The editorial stated that the demonstrations by youths and students stemmed from their full awareness and sense of responsibility towards the nation. The editorial pointed out that the liberation of West Irian is a matter for the entire nation, and all the people must strive to liberate West Irian from Dutch rule. Therefore, the editorial demanded the release of the students and youths arrested in May who are still being detained.

According to local newspaper reports, anti-Dutch demonstrations erupted in some major Indonesian cities in April and May, demanding a firm stance against Dutch military provocations in West Irian. Some demonstrators were arrested by the military authorities on the grounds of "violating regulations prohibiting political activities."

Not long ago, the Jakarta military authorities announced that five detainees were released on June 6th. They had been imprisoned for a month.

General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party, D.N. Aidit, sent a telegram to the Indonesian University Student Movement League, congratulating these youths on their freedom. Aidit's telegram stated that their release was a blow to the Dutch colonial aggressors and their running dogs in Indonesia. Aidit called on them to continue their efforts to secure the release of arrested students in other cities and to strengthen the struggle for the liberation of West Irian and the expansion of people's democratic rights.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 18th: The Indonesian "People's Daily" published a commentary today regarding the Jakarta military authorities' arrest on June 17th of those who delivered a "Statement on the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" to the Japanese Embassy in Indonesia. The commentary stated that the actions of the people of Jakarta stemmed from the indelible suffering experienced by the Indonesian people and from their legitimate concerns, because the Indonesian people had also suffered cruel massacres and persecution by Japanese militarists. As one of the members of the Tojo Cabinet, Nobusuke Kishi cannot escape responsibility for these crimes.

The "People's Daily" said that the Indonesian people's actions in demanding the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Japanese Embassy are not only a support for the struggles of other countries but also a defense of their own country.

The "People's Daily" said that the Indonesian government should objectively assess the people's statements condemning the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and Nobusuke Kishi.

    印度尼西亚“青年报”发表社论
    要求全部释放因反荷示威而被捕的青年
    “人民日报”要求政府客观判断人民谴责日美条约的声明
    新华社雅加达18日电　印度尼西亚“青年报”16日发表社论，要求全部释放因参加反对荷兰军事挑衅的示威而被捕的大学生和青年。
    社论说，青年和学生举行示威是出于他们的充分觉悟和对祖国的责任感。社论指出，解放西伊里安是全国人民的事，全体人民必须努力把西伊里安从荷兰的统治下解放出来。因此，社论要求释放5月间被捕而迄今仍被拘禁的学生和青年。
    据这里的报纸报道，今年4月和5月，印度尼西亚的某些大城市曾爆发反荷示威，要求采取坚决的态度来对付荷兰在西伊里安的军事挑衅。有些参加示威的人被军事当局以“违反了关于禁止政治活动的条例”为理由而逮捕。
    不久以前雅加达军事当局曾经宣布，6月6日释放了五个被捕者。他们被监禁了一个月。
    印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地曾致电印度尼西亚大学生运动联盟，祝贺这些青年获得自由。艾地的电报说，他们的获释，是对荷兰殖民侵略者及其在印度尼西亚的走狗的打击。艾地号召他们继续努力，力争其他城市的被捕学生获释，并加强争取解放西伊里安和扩大人民民主权利的斗争。
    据新华社雅加达18日电　印度尼西亚“人民日报”今天就雅加达军事当局17日逮捕向日本驻印度尼西亚大使馆递交“关于日美安全条约声明”的人发表评论说，雅加达人民的行动，是出于印度尼西亚人民受过的不能磨灭的痛苦，出自他们正当的担心，因为印度尼西亚人民也曾受到日本军国主义者的残酷屠杀和迫害，作为东条内阁的阁员之一的岸信介，不能逃避对这些罪行的责任。
    “人民日报”说，印度尼西亚人民通过外交部和日本大使馆要求废除日美“安全条约”的行动不仅是对其他国家人民斗争的支持，而且也保卫了自己的祖国。
    “人民日报”说，印度尼西亚政府应当客观地判断人民谴责日美“安全条约”和岸信介的声明。
