Comrades!

    Today is the tenth anniversary of the heroic Korean people's Fatherland Liberation War. Ten years ago today, U.S. imperialism launched a war of aggression against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and extended the flames of war to the Chinese border. The Korean people waged a heroic battle against the aggression, and the Chinese people also sent volunteers to fight alongside the Korean people, dealing a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism. The Korean people's just struggle is part of the just struggle of the people of the world. The great victory of the Korean people's anti-aggression war and their unremitting efforts to uphold the Korean Armistice Agreement and safeguard peace in Asia and the world are a support for the struggle of all the people of the world against U.S. imperialism.

    After its disastrous defeat on the Korean battlefield, U.S. imperialism intensified its arms expansion and war preparations in the Far East, piecing together military blocs and creating tension. This fully proves its nature of aggression and plunder. Recently, U.S. imperialism sent its reactionary chieftain, Eisenhower, to the Far East to plot new wars. The people of the Far East, who have suffered deeply from the oppression of U.S. imperialism, have roared in anger and everywhere there have been storms of struggle against U.S. imperialism and against the god of plague, Eisenhower. Eisenhower is like a rat crossing the street, hunted by everyone, in a situation of being beaten everywhere and unprecedentedly isolated. His trip to the Far East has suffered a shameful defeat.

    From the anti-U.S. struggle of the Asian people, we can see that the Far East today is no longer the Far East where U.S. imperialism runs rampant, but the Far East where the people of various countries have risen up to oppose the U.S. aggressors. The people of the Far East, together with the people of the world, are increasingly aware that U.S. imperialism is the number one enemy of the people of the world and the most ferocious enemy of world peace. U.S. imperialism is increasingly falling into a position of unprecedented isolation and is increasingly heading towards the dead end of collapse and demise. The lifespan of U.S. imperialism will indeed not be very long.

    We, the Chinese people, together with the people of the great socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, are determined to unite with the people of Asia and the world to form the broadest united front and carry the struggle against U.S. imperialism through to the end. We resolutely oppose U.S. imperialist aggression against our country's territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu, and we must liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu. We resolutely oppose U.S. imperialist occupation of South Korea, resolutely support the South Korean people's just and patriotic anti-U.S. struggle, and resolutely support the Korean people's just struggle for the peaceful reunification of their country. We resolutely oppose the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and resolutely support the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. Resolutely support the democratic struggle of the Japanese people. We resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism's occupation of South Vietnam, resolutely support the South Vietnamese people's patriotic and democratic struggle against U.S. imperialism and Ngo Dinh Diem, and resolutely support the Vietnamese people's just struggle for the peaceful reunification of Vietnam. We must overthrow U.S. imperialism. Let us shout:

    U.S. imperialism get out of Taiwan! Get out of South Korea! Get out of Japan! Get out of the Philippines! Get out of South Vietnam! Get out from the Western Pacific!

    People of China, people of Korea, people of Japan, people of Vietnam, people of Asia, people of the world unite and overthrow U.S. imperialism!

    远东和世界各国人民团结起来
    把反美帝侵略斗争坚持到底
    中华全国总工会副主席刘长胜的讲话同志们！
    今天是英雄的朝鲜人民祖国解放战争十周年纪念日。十年前的今天，美帝国主义发动了对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的侵略战争，并且把战火燃烧到中国边境。朝鲜人民为了反对侵略，进行了英勇的战斗，中国人民也派出了志愿军同朝鲜人民并肩作战，狠狠地打击了美帝国主义。朝鲜人民的正义斗争是世界人民正义斗争的一部分，朝鲜人民反侵略战争的大胜利，朝鲜人民维护朝鲜停战协定、保障亚洲和世界和平的不懈努力，对于全世界人民反对美帝国主义的斗争都是一种支持。
    美帝国主义在朝鲜战场惨败后，在远东加紧扩军备战，拼凑军事集团，制造紧张局势，这充分证明了它的侵略和掠夺本质。最近美帝国主义派遣了它的反动头子艾森豪威尔到远东策划新的战争。深受美帝国主义压迫的远东人民发出了怒吼，到处爆发了反对美帝国主义反对瘟神艾森豪威尔的斗争风暴。艾森豪威尔像过街老鼠，人人喊打，处于到处挨打、空前孤立的境地。他的远东之行已遭到可耻的失败。
    从亚洲人民的反美斗争中可以看到：今日的远东已经不是美帝国主义横行霸道的远东，而是远东各国人民起来反对美国侵略者的远东了。远东人民和世界人民一起，越来越认清了美帝国主义是世界人民的头号敌人，是世界和平的最凶恶的敌人。美帝国主义日益陷于空前孤立的处境，日益走向崩溃灭亡的穷途末路。美帝国主义的寿命确实不会很长了。
    我们中国人民，和以苏联为首的伟大的社会主义阵营各国人民在一起，坚决和亚洲和全世界人民团结一致，结成最广泛的统一战线，一定要把反对美帝国主义的斗争坚持到底。我们坚决反对美帝国主义侵略我祖国领土台、澎、金、马，一定要解放台、澎、金、马。我们坚决反对美帝国主义侵占南朝鲜，坚决支持南朝鲜人民的反美爱国正义斗争，坚决支持朝鲜人民争取祖国和平统一的正义斗争。我们坚决反对日美军事同盟条约，坚决支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的爱国正义斗争。坚决支持日本人民的民主斗争。我们坚决反对美帝侵占南越南，坚决支持南越南人民反美反吴庭艳的爱国民主斗争，坚决支持越南人民为和平统一越南而进行的正义斗争。我们一定要打倒美帝国主义。让我们高呼：
    美帝国主义从台湾滚出去！从南朝鲜滚出去！从日本滚出去！从菲律宾滚出去！从南越滚出去！从西太平洋滚出去！
    中国人民、朝鲜人民、日本人民、越南人民、亚洲人民、世界人民团结起来，打倒美帝国主义！
