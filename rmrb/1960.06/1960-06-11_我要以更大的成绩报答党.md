    I Will Repay the Party with Greater Achievements
    Deqin, Teacher at the National Elementary Normal School of Dulan County, Qinghai Province
    I am a teacher at the National Elementary Normal School of Dulan County, Qinghai Province.
    I was born into a poor Mongolian family. In the dark old society, the Mongolian people lived a life worse than livestock under the cruel oppression of the Chiang Kai-shek/Ma Bufang bandit gang, herd-owners and headmen. When I was seven years old, my parents, unable to support me, reluctantly sent me to herd sheep for a herd-owner. I was often whipped by the herd-owner, slept in the wilderness, and ate leftover dregs, spending my childhood in tears.
    In 1949, like a thunderclap in a tranquil place, the Party brought happiness and warmth to our fraternal nationalities. From then on, we Mongolian people were completely liberated. I returned home from the herd-owner's and reunited with my family, and life was full of joy. In order to train ethnic minority cadres, the Party sent me to study at the Qinghai Nationalities Institute in 1952, and later to the Northwest Nationalities Institute for further study. I often think: a sheep herder can have the opportunity to study, this is given by the Party and Chairman Mao. After graduation, I honorably became a teacher at the Dulan County National Elementary Normal School. I am determined to repay the Party's care and kindness with excellent achievements.
    The bitterness of the old society and the contrast with today's happy life encourage me to complete the tasks assigned to me by the Party. I teach mathematics, and because my arithmetic foundation is poor, I often encounter difficulties in teaching; so I learn from my comrades, sometimes staying up late. I learn and teach at the same time, gradually improving.
    Lesson preparation is a prerequisite for teaching well. In order to teach well, I do all the example problems I am going to talk about in class during lesson preparation, so that I am sure of them. At the same time, I often understand the students' learning difficulties as the basis for lesson preparation. For example, students reflect: The combination of four arithmetic operations and practical life is not close enough, and it is difficult to understand. When teaching students about distance and area, I guide students to conduct actual measurements. I also often collect specific and vivid numbers related to the socialist construction of the motherland, the development of industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry, and the achievements of students' labor production to compile example questions, so that teaching is combined with actual production, improves students' political and ideological level, and improves teaching effectiveness.
    When I teach, I start with simple and easy-to-understand examples, explaining them repeatedly to make students understand thoroughly, according to the students' comprehension ability, from simple to complex, from shallow to deep. In addition to frequently soliciting students' opinions, I also actively ask other teachers for help to learn their advanced teaching methods.
    In the teaching process, I also pay attention to grasping the students' ideological situation, especially patiently helping backward students, giving them extra lessons outside of class, and having individual talks, never letting go of any of the students' shortcomings.
    Due to the Party's education and the help of my comrades, my teaching ability has improved. The arithmetic level of the students in the Mongolian Class Three that I taught has jumped from the third grade of elementary school to the first grade of junior high school in two and a half years, and the percentage of students with excellent grades has increased from 23% in the second semester of 1958 to 72% in the first semester of 1959.
    I love labor, and I always work diligently in every labor, playing a leading role. During the Great Leap Forward in steelmaking in 1958, our school was in charge of transportation tasks. I carried forty bricks on my back, traveling back and forth on the eight-li road. Although the soles of my feet were worn out, and my comrades advised me to rest, I persisted until the task was completed for the sake of the motherland's construction and the happiness of the minority areas. In order to respond to the Party's call for increasing production and practicing economy, in the cold midnight, I led the students to dig Suoyang (a substitute food) in an area forty li away with great interest. After a day's labor, we returned fully loaded, saving grain, and I was named a Red Banner bearer. Now I am the production committee member, leading the students to reclaim wasteland for farming.
    In the anti-Rightist struggle, I resolutely struggled against bad people and bad deeds: criticizing the reactionary remarks of teachers; at the same time, actively writing big-character posters, boldly examining my own shortcomings, and defending the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune.
    I not only often learn from my comrades and get help from others, but also help my comrades to make progress together. For example, Nima Dongzhu, the arithmetic teacher of Mongolian Class Two, often encounters difficulties in teaching. I actively help him make intuitive teaching aids, study the teaching materials with him, and improve teaching methods, which has improved the quality of arithmetic teaching in Mongolian Class Two and enhanced his teaching confidence. At the same time, when there are no Mongolian documents during political study, I translate the documents into Mongolian for the Mongolian teachers after reading them. When teachers have problems in their thinking, I talk to them. In the past two years, I have united very well with Mongolian, Tibetan, and Han teachers, which has not only improved my ideological level but also helped others.
    In the past, the school's food was once not very good. The Party organization called on teachers to go to the kitchen to find out the bottom of the food. I responded to the Party's call and first went to the kitchen. Together with other teachers, under the leadership of the Party, we made the food very good, with large steamed buns and fragrant dishes, which was praised by teachers and students.
    I have not done much work. If I have made a little achievement, it is all due to the Party's training and the help of my comrades. It is still far from the Party's requirements for me. In the future, I will continue to work hard and make greater and better achievements to answer the Party's training of me.

    我要以更大的成绩报答党
    青海省都兰县民族初级师范学校教师　德钦
    我是青海省都兰县民族初级师范学校的教师。
    我出身在一个贫苦的蒙民家庭里，在黑暗的旧社会中，蒙族人民在蒋马匪帮和牧主、头人的残酷压榨下，过着牛马不如的生活。七岁时父母由于养不活我，忍痛地把我送给牧主去挡羊，经常受到牧主的鞭打，夜宿野地，吃的是糟糠剩饭，在泪水中熬过自己的童年时代。
    1949年，平地一声春雷，党给兄弟民族带来了幸福、温暖。从此，我们蒙族人民也彻底翻了身，我从牧主处回到家里，和亲人团聚在一起，生活充满了欢乐。党为了培养民族干部，1952年送我到青海省民族学院学习，以后又到西北民族学院进修。我常常想：一个挡羊娃能够有读书的机会，这是党和毛主席给予的。毕业后，我光荣地担任了都兰县民族初级师范的教师。我决心以优异的成绩来报答党的关怀与恩情。
    旧社会的辛酸，和今天幸福生活的对比激励着我，我要很好地完成党交给我的任务。我教数学课，由于自己算术基础差，教学上时常遇到困难；我就向同志们学习，有时深夜不眠。边学边教，逐步提高。
    备课是教好课的前提条件。为了要讲好课，我在课堂上所要讲的例题，在备课时一一地作了演算，使自己心中有数。同时，经常了解学生的学习难点，作为备课的依据。如学生反映：四则应用题与实际生活结合的不紧，理解困难。在给学生讲授距离、面积时，我就指导学生进行实际测量。我还经常汇集有关祖国社会主义建设、工农牧业发展情况、学生劳动生产成果等方面的具体生动的数字编写例题，使教学与生产实际结合，提高学生的政治思想水平，提高教学效果。
    我讲课时根据学生的理解力，由简到繁，由浅入深，先从容易理解的简易例题入手，反复地讲解，使学生理解透彻。我除了经常征求学生的意见外，还主动请求其他教师的帮助，学习他们的先进教学方法。
    我在教学过程中还注意掌握学生的思想情况，特别耐心地帮助后进的学生，在课外给他们补课，个别谈话，决不放过学生的任何缺点。
    由于党对我的教育和同志们的帮助，我的教学能力有所提高，我教的蒙三班学生，在两年半的时间内，算术程度由初小三年级跃进到初中一年级的水平，成绩优良的由1958年下学期的23％上升为1959年上学期的72％。
    我喜爱劳动，在每次劳动中总是踏踏实实地干，起到了带头作用。1958年大炼钢铁时，我校担任运输任务。我背上四十块砖，往返八华里的道路上，虽然脚底磨破了，同志们劝我休息，但我为了祖国的建设，为了少数民族地区的幸福。我一直坚持到任务完成。为了响应党的增产节约的号召，在寒冷的午夜，我领着学生兴致勃勃地到四十里以外的地区去挖琐阳（代食品）。经过一天的劳动，满载而归，节约了粮食，我被评为红旗手。现在我担任了生产委员，在带领着同学开荒种地。
    在反右倾斗争中，我坚决向坏人坏事进行斗争：批判教师中的反动言论；同时，积极写大字报，大胆检查自己的缺点，保卫总路线、大跃进和人民公社。
    我不但经常向同志们学习，取得别人的帮助，同时也帮助同志，共同进步。如蒙二班算术教师尼玛东主在教学上常遇到困难，我主动地帮助他制作直观教具，和他一起研究教材，改进教学方法，使蒙二班的算术教学质量有了提高，增强了他的教学信心。同时，在政治学习时没有蒙文文件，我看了文件后，就给蒙族教师译成蒙文。教师们在思想上有了问题，就和他们交谈。两年来，我和蒙、藏、汉族教师团结得很好，既提高了自己的思想水平，也帮助了别人。
    过去学校伙食曾一度搞得不太好，党组织号召教师下厨房，摸清伙食的底。我响应党的号召，首先下伙房。和其他教师一起，在党的领导下，把伙食搞得很好，馍大菜香，受到师生的称赞。
    我做的工作不多，如果说有一点成绩，这都是由于党的培养，同志们帮助的结果，比起党对我的要求还差得很远。今后我要继续努力，作出更大更好的成绩，来回答党对我的培养。
