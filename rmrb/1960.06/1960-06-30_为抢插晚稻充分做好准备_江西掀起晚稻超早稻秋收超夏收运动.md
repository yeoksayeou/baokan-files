Xinhua News Agency report: Jiangxi, while vigorously grasping the late-stage field management of early rice, has launched a large-scale campaign for late rice to surpass early rice and autumn harvest to surpass summer harvest.

This year, the early rice in Jiangxi is generally growing well and is now heading and flowering. Intermediate rice and single-season late rice are also lush and green. At present, while harrowing and fertilizing early and intermediate rice and single-season late rice, various places are seizing the opportunity before the harvest of early rice to prepare for the planting of double-season late rice.

In preparing for double-season late rice planting, various places first focused on the crucial link of planting more and planting well. Due to the adoption of measures such as transforming dry land into paddy fields, single-season into double-season, turning abandoned ponds into paddy fields, and reclaiming lake fields and shoals, the planting area of double-season late rice in the province this year will be greatly expanded compared with last year. In order to expand the planting area of late rice, various places have tried every means to solve the problems of seedling fields and seeds. As early as mid-May, various places arranged a batch of labor to tidy up the original late rice seedling fields and open up new seedling fields. The communes in Ganxian County adopted methods such as wasteland reclamation, intercropping in taro fields, and sowing seeds on water channels, field edges, and stream sides, promptly solving the problem of insufficient seedling fields. Through mutual adjustments between teams, communes, and counties, various places have prepared sufficient fine seeds for double-season late rice. Fengcheng County alone has adjusted and allocated more than 1.5 million jin of double-season late rice seeds. At present, the soaking and sowing of double-season late rice seedling fields throughout the province has basically ended, and the work of cultivating strong seedlings has begun.

With the expansion of the double-season late rice planting area, a large-scale summer fertilizer accumulation upsurge has been launched throughout the province. More than one million people are climbing mountains and wading through rivers to accumulate and produce fertilizer for double-season late rice. In addition to green manure and farm manure, there are also more than 10,000 local chemical fertilizer plants, granular fertilizer plants, and bacterial fertilizer plants put into production throughout the province.

The tool reform movement is also widely unfolding. In addition to actively repairing and manufacturing tools for early rice harvesting, threshing, and shelling, various places have organized professional teams to go deep into the production teams to repair the rice transplanters damaged during the early rice transplanting. At the same time, local farm tool factories and machinery factories have organized manufacturing professional teams to vigorously manufacture rice transplanters to ensure that double-season late rice is planted fully and well.

### 为抢插晚稻充分做好准备  江西掀起晚稻超早稻秋收超夏收运动

    为抢插晚稻充分做好准备
    江西掀起晚稻超早稻秋收超夏收运动
    据新华社讯　江西各地在狠抓早稻后期田间管理的同时，又掀起声势浩大的晚稻超早稻、秋收超夏收运动。
    今年江西早稻普遍生长良好，正在抽穗扬花，中稻和一季晚稻也已一片葱绿。目前各地一面为早中稻和一季晚稻耘禾、追肥，一面抓紧早稻收割前的时机，为抢插双季晚稻做好准备。
    在准备双季晚稻播种时，各地首先抓住了多种、种好这一环节。由于采取了旱地变水田，一季变二季，废荒水池变水田，开垦湖田洲地等措施，今年全省双季晚稻种植面积将比去年扩大很多。为了扩大晚稻播种面积，各地又千方百计地解决秧田和种籽问题。早在5月中旬，各地就安排了一批劳动力，一面整理原有晚稻秧田，一面开辟新秧田。赣县各公社采取开荒，芋头田间作，在水圳、田边、溪边播种等办法，及时解决了秧田不足的问题。各地通过队与队、社与社、县与县之间的互相调剂，已为双季晚稻备足了良种。仅丰城县就调剂出双季晚稻种子一百五十多万斤。现在，全省双季晚稻秧田的浸种、播种工作已基本结束，开始培育壮秧。
    随着双季晚稻种植面积扩大，全省又掀起了声势浩大的夏季积肥高潮。一百多万积肥造肥大军正登山下水，为双季晚稻积造肥料。除沤青肥、积农家肥以外，全省还有一万多个土化肥厂、颗粒肥料厂、细菌肥料厂投入生产。
    工具改革运动也在广泛展开。各地除积极修造早稻收割、打谷、脱粒等工具外，已组织专业队深入各生产队整修早稻插秧中损坏了的插秧机。同时，各地农具厂、机械厂都组织制造专业队，大力制造插秧机，以保证双季晚稻种足种好。
