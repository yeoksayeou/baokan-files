Xinhua News Agency, 9th June: Agustin Novella, President of the World Federation of Trade Unions, at the closing meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council, called on the international working class to unite more closely to defend world peace.

He condemned U.S. imperialism for undermining peace. He said that developments have proven that imperialism is weakening and the forces of peace are strengthening.

He said: We have unanimously made a decision here that we must move forward. We must expand and strengthen the struggle, and we must strengthen international solidarity, while considering the decisive significance of the struggle of the masses, especially the working class and laborers, to strengthen the forces of peace and strive for lasting peace.

Novella said: The documents passed by the meeting expressed a common idea, which provided the mass movement, the struggle of the working people, and the international workers' movement with correct and necessary goals. He said: Now we have issued the necessary instructions on unity and struggle. He said that the situation shows that the working class has more confidence in the strength of peace advocates, and the developing new situation makes it clearer that the struggle of workers in all countries is more necessary. This is also the condition for further unity of workers in all sectors in the struggle to defend peace, strive for social liberation, and strive to establish a new socialist society. This further unity will enable us to increase our confidence, thereby exerting combat effectiveness, and moving forward more and more rapidly in the spirit of international solidarity.

He said that the general goal of the international working class movement is common, that is, to defend peace, ease the international situation and peaceful coexistence, the struggle of the people of all countries for national independence, and the struggle of workers to get rid of capitalist exploitation.

He pointed out that peaceful coexistence means the abolition of the policy of strength, which means the abolition of military and political interference between countries, and is combined with the people's struggle to get rid of military occupation and oppose any new military and political interference in their own countries. Peaceful coexistence depends on the decisive role of the development of mass struggles.

He emphasized that people must never interpret peaceful coexistence between countries as a relaxation of class struggle and anti-imperialist struggle; the struggle to defend peace is always combined with the development of class struggle in capitalist countries, and with the struggle of the people of all countries for national liberation and against imperialist oppression.

When talking about the changes in the balance of international forces, he said that the changes in the balance of forces in the past few years have been favorable to the peace camp and the socialist camp. He praised the heroic struggles of the working people of Japan, Korea, and Turkey as examples for the working people of the world.

He said, it is only natural that the colonial people's desire for peace and national independence is expressed in the heroic liberation struggle with weapons in their hands. He said that the struggle to defend peace in capitalist countries is also support for the colonial people, and support for the initiatives of the countries of the socialist camp, and is linked to the national and social liberation movement because it is the struggle to get rid of capitalist exploitation and to strive for the establishment of a new society without capitalist exploitation. He said: Great unity must be achieved in the great struggle of workers and all oppressed masses all over the world. He said that the council filled everyone with confidence and strength to carry out larger-scale struggles for the people of colonial countries and the people of capitalist countries to get rid of all exploitation.

    诺维拉在世界工联理事会议闭幕会议上指出
    国际工人阶级必须加强团结和斗争
    人们决不能把各国之间的和平共处解释为是阶级斗争和反帝斗争的缓和，保卫和平的斗争始终是同资本主义国家阶级斗争的发展，同各国人民争取民族解放和反对帝国主义压迫的斗争结合起来的
    新华社9日讯　世界工联主席奥古斯丁诺·诺维拉在世界工联理事会议闭幕会议上号召国际工人阶级更紧密团结起来保卫世界和平。
    他谴责美帝国主义破坏和平。他说事态发展证明帝国主义更加削弱，和平力量更为加强。
    他说：我们在这里一致作出决定，我们必须向前迈进。必须扩大加强斗争，必须加强国际团结。同时考虑到群众、特别是工人阶级和劳动者，为增强和平力量和争取持久和平而进行的斗争的决定性意义。
    诺维拉说：会议通过的文件表达了共同的思想，它给群众运动、劳动人民的斗争，给国际工人运动提供了正确的和必要的目标。他说：现在我们已经就团结和斗争发出了必要的指示。他说，局势表明工人阶级对和平拥护者的力量信心更大了，发展中的新形势更加清楚地表明：各国工人的斗争更有必要，这也是一切部门的工人在保卫和平、争取社会解放，争取建立社会主义新社会的斗争中进一步团结的条件。这种进一步团结将使我们增强信心，从而发挥战斗性，并本着国际团结的精神日益迅速向前迈进。
    他说，国际工人阶级运动的总目标是共同的，那就是保卫和平、缓和国际局势和和平共处、各国人民争取民族独立、以及工人争取摆脱资本主义剥削。
    他指出，和平共处意味着取消实力地位政策，意味着取消在各国之间进行军事和政治干涉，而且又同人民争取摆脱军事占领和反对在他们国内进行任何新军事和政治干涉的斗争结合起来。和平共处要依靠群众斗争的发展的决定性作用。
    他强调指出，人们决不能把各国之间的和平共处解释为是阶级斗争和反帝斗争的缓和；保卫和平的斗争始终是同资本主义国家阶级斗争的发展，同各国人民争取民族解放和反对帝国主义压迫的斗争结合起来的。
    当谈到国际力量对比的变化时，他说，过去几年力量对比的变化是有利于和平阵营，有利于社会主义阵营的。他赞扬了日本、朝鲜、土耳其的劳动人民的英勇斗争是全世界劳动人民的榜样。
    他说，这是很自然的，殖民地人民对和平和民族独立的愿望正以手拿武器的英勇的解放斗争表现出来。他说，在资本各国保卫和平的斗争同时也是对殖民地人民的支援，也是对社会主义阵营各国倡议的支援，又是争取摆脱资本主义剥削和争取建立没有资本主义剥削的新社会的斗争，因而同民族和社会解放运动联结起来。他说：全世界工人和一切被压迫群众的巨大斗争中必须实现大团结。他说，理事会使大家充满信心和力量去为争取殖民地各国人民和资本主义各国人民摆脱一切剥削进行规模更为巨大的斗争。
