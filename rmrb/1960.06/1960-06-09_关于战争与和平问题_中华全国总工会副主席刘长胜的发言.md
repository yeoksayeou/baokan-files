Xinhua News Agency, 8th: Speech (excerpts) by Liu Changsheng, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and Vice President of the World Federation of Trade Unions, at the morning session of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council on the 8th:

Liu Changsheng said that the issue of war and peace is a matter of concern to everyone. He would like to express some opinions on this issue.

He said that on the issue of war and peace, we have always been in favor of defending world peace, peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, easing international tensions, and disarmament. However, on the issue of war and peace, there are some fundamental principles that must be clarified. If these issues are not clarified, we will go astray in defending peace.

He said that to decide what attitude to take towards war, it is first necessary to distinguish the nature of the war. Wars waged by imperialist countries against each other for colonies are unjust wars; wars waged by imperialism to suppress colonial peoples and their own people, and to invade other countries are unjust wars. Revolutionary wars waged by colonial peoples and oppressed people in imperialist countries to liberate themselves are just wars. Because imperialism uses force to suppress oppressed peoples and oppressed nations, oppressed peoples and oppressed nations cannot but arm themselves. We must support and uphold just revolutionary wars, and we must oppose and stop unjust wars. If wars are not specifically analyzed, and it is merely stated in general terms whether or not one is for or against war, this is incorrect.

He pointed out that the so-called question of whether war can be avoided mainly refers to world war. Regarding the question of whether world war can be avoided, it should be pointed out that, on the one hand, with the continuous growth of the strength of socialist countries, the continuous growth of the strength of the liberation movement in colonial and semi-colonial countries, the continuous growth of the strength of the revolutionary and peace-defending movements of the people of all countries in the world, and the struggle of these forces united together, there is the possibility of preventing imperialism from launching a new world war. On the other hand, because imperialism still exists, there is still the source of war, the soil of war, and war maniacs. Therefore, there is still the danger of imperialism launching a new world war. Only speaking of the possibility of preventing imperialism from launching a world war, without mentioning the danger of imperialism launching a world war, without being vigilant against the military adventurism of war maniacs, will only paralyze ourselves and the people, and benefit imperialism's arms expansion and war preparations. Once imperialism launches a war, the people of all countries may panic and suffer unnecessary significant losses due to lack of mental preparation. It is completely wrong to think that war can be eliminated forever under the conditions that imperialism still exists. Spreading such illusions about imperialism among the people of all countries in the world will have serious consequences, and in fact, such consequences can already be seen.

Liu Changsheng said that as for the wars waged by imperialism to suppress colonial and semi-colonial countries and the national liberation wars of colonial and semi-colonial peoples against imperialism, the wars waged by the exploiting classes in capitalist countries to suppress the people and the people's revolutionary wars, these types of wars have always existed in history, and have never stopped in the capitalist world after the Second World War. The wars in Vietnam and Algeria, the war over the Suez Canal issue, and the war in Cuba are all such wars. In the future, under the conditions that imperialism still exists and the exploitation system still exists, these wars of different natures will still be unavoidable. It is completely wrong and completely unrealistic to think that wars of the above-mentioned natures can be avoided. This view makes the oppressed people lose their fighting spirit, and unprepared to arm themselves when the enemy carries out armed suppression, to actively fight the fully armed enemy in order to liberate themselves. In reality, this is to make the oppressed people only be in a state of enslavement forever.

He said that we advocate peaceful coexistence between socialist countries and capitalist countries.

Since the Second World War, although our socialist countries have tried their best to strive for peaceful coexistence and have unremittingly promoted various peaceful policies, imperialism headed by the United States has consistently adhered to a cold war policy, adhered to arms expansion and war preparations, and created tensions. We should tell the people not to be intimidated by the cold war waged by imperialism, but to resolutely rise up to oppose imperialism's cold war policy, expose the ugly original form of imperialism, and wage tit-for-tat struggles against it. Only in this way is it possible to prevent the cold war from developing into a hot war.

We must fully estimate that imperialism, due to its increasingly serious internal crisis, and because it wants to strengthen its oppression and rule over its own people and the colonial people, will maintain a cold war policy for a long time, impose the cold war on the people of the world, and continue to maintain its strong military power and entire state apparatus. Therefore, defending world peace and opposing imperialism is a long-term struggle that the people of all countries must carry out.

Liu Changsheng said that we support the Soviet Union's proposal for disarmament. Of course, it cannot be assumed that imperialism will accept the proposal for complete and thorough disarmament. The purpose of making the proposal is to mobilize the people of the world to unite and oppose imperialism's plans for arms expansion and war preparations, and to expose the aggressive and bellicose nature of imperialism in front of the people of the world, so as to isolate the imperialist group headed by the United States to the greatest extent and prevent it from launching a war easily. Some people now believe that this proposal can be realized under the conditions that imperialism exists, and that relying on this proposal can "eradicate the danger of war." This is an unrealistic illusion. As for the idea that after imperialism disarms, it will use the military expenditure saved to "seek welfare for the working masses," to "aid underdeveloped countries," and that it can "bring universal progress to all people without exception," that is simply applying powder to imperialism, beautifying imperialism, and even simply helping imperialism headed by the United States to deceive the people of all countries in the world.

He pointed out that only in the era when the socialist revolution triumphs all over the world can there be a world without war and without weapons. It is inconceivable that there can be a world without weapons and without war when imperialism still exists. This is not a question of whether we are willing or not, but a question of whether imperialism will absolutely not lay down its weapons voluntarily. Imperialism will not lay down its weapons in order to suppress its own people, will not lay down its weapons in order to suppress colonies, and will not lay down its weapons in order to expand and invade other countries. Past history has proven this point, and it will continue to prove this point in the future.

Liu Changsheng said that we believe that we must strive to establish an agreement prohibiting nuclear weapons and strive to avoid a nuclear war in the world. Now, the Soviet Union has mastered nuclear weapons, causing U.S. imperialism to lose its atomic monopoly. The Soviet Union and the socialist countries should continue to develop their advantages in atomic energy. At the same time, the people of all countries in the world should more widely launch a struggle against imperialism and against nuclear weapons. Only under such conditions is it possible to reach such an agreement. But even if an agreement is reached, imperialism may tear it up. Even if it does not dare to launch a large-scale nuclear war for its own interests, it may still use so-called conventional weapons to wage war. Therefore, no matter what the circumstances, the people of the world must maintain a high degree of vigilance against imperialism and must not treat U.S. imperialism and other imperialists with a naive attitude.

He said that in order to strive for world peace, the struggle of the people of all countries and the diplomatic negotiations of socialist countries should be combined with each other. One cannot abandon the people's struggle because of diplomatic negotiations. On the contrary, diplomatic negotiations must be backed by the united struggle of the people of all countries in the world. To strive for world peace, we must mainly rely on the struggles of the people of all countries. We should: constantly strengthen the strength of socialist countries; constantly strengthen the strength of the liberation movements of colonial and dependent countries; constantly strengthen the strength of the people's revolutionary forces within imperialist countries; constantly expose the imperialist group headed by the United States; constantly expose the modern revisionists who serve imperialism; and at the same time, with full tactical skills, make use of the contradictions between imperialist countries and between the various monopoly capital groups within each imperialist country. Liu Changsheng said at the end of his speech that we believe that as long as we make the above-mentioned efforts, and unite all the forces that can be united in the anti-imperialist front, and form a broad united front, we will surely be able to defeat the bellicose forces of imperialism and win the great victory of defending world peace.

    关于战争与和平问题
    中华全国总工会副主席刘长胜的发言
    我们一向赞成保卫世界和平，赞成裁减军备。——必须区别战争的性质，我们必须赞成和拥护正义的革命战争，反对和制止非正义的战争，如果笼统地提赞成不赞成战争、反对不反对战争，是错误的。——帝国主义还存在，就存在着战争的根源，如果认为还存在帝国主义的条件下，就可以永远消灭战争，是错误的。——不能设想帝国主义会接受全面彻底裁军的建议，有人认为依靠这种建议，就能“根绝战争危险”，这是不切实际的幻想。——帝国主义还存在，所谓没有武器没有战争的世界是不可设想的。——不能因为要外交谈判就不要人民斗争，外交谈判必须以人民的团结的斗争作后盾。要争取世界和平，主要只能依靠各国人民的斗争。
    新华社8日讯　世界工联副主席、中华全国总工会副主席刘长胜在世界工联理事会8日上午会议上的发言（摘要）
    刘长胜说，战争与和平的问题是大家都关心的问题。他想就这个问题发表一些意见。
    他说，在战争与和平的问题上，我们一向赞成保卫世界和平，赞成不同社会制度国家的和平共处，赞成缓和国际紧张局势，赞成裁减军备。但是，在战争和和平问题上，还有一些根本原则的问题，必须加以澄清。如果不弄清楚这些问题，我们就会在保卫和平的问题上走入歧途。
    他说，要决定对战争采取什么态度，首先必须区别战争的性质。帝国主义国家和帝国主义国家之间为争夺殖民地而进行的战争是非正义的战争，帝国主义镇压殖民地人民和镇压本国人民，侵略别的国家的战争是非正义的战争。而殖民地人民和帝国主义国家中被压迫人民为解放自己而进行的革命战争是正义的战争。因为帝国主义用武力来镇压被压迫人民和被压迫民族，所以被压迫人民和被压迫民族也不能不武装起来。我们必须赞成和拥护正义的革命的战争，必须反对和制止非正义的战争。如果不对战争进行具体分析，笼统地提赞成不赞成战争，反对不反对战争，是错误的。
    他指出，所谓战争是不是可以避免的问题，我们以为主要是指世界大战而言。对于世界大战是否可以避免的问题，应该指出，一方面，在社会主义国家力量不断壮大，殖民地半殖民地的解放运动的力量不断壮大，世界各国人民革命运动和保卫和平运动的力量不断壮大，并在这些力量联合起来进行斗争的条件下，有制止帝国主义发动新的世界大战的可能性，另一方面，由于帝国主义还存在，就还存在着战争的根源，还存在着战争的土壤，还存在着战争狂人，所以还存在着帝国主义发动新的世界大战的危险性。只说有制止帝国主义发动世界大战的可能性，不讲帝国主义发动世界大战的危险，不警惕战争狂人的军事冒险性，就会麻痹自己，麻痹人民，而有利于帝国主义的扩军备战；一旦帝国主义发动战争时，各国人民就可能由于没有精神准备而惊惶失措，以至遭到不应有的重大损失。如果认为在还存在着帝国主义的条件下，就可以永远消灭战争，这是完全错误的。在全世界各国人民中散播这种对帝国主义的幻想，将会造成严重的恶果，而且事实上现在已经可以看到这种恶果了。
    刘长胜说，至于说到帝国主义镇压殖民地半殖民地的战争和殖民地、半殖民地人民反帝国主义的民族解放战争，资本主义国家内剥削阶级镇压人民的战争和人民的革命战争，这些性质的战争，在历史上从来是存在的，在第二次世界大战后，在资本主义世界中，也从未停止过。越南、阿尔及利亚的战争，苏伊士运河问题的战争，古巴的战争都是这样的战争。今后在帝国主义还存在的条件下，在剥削制度还存在的条件下，这些不同性质的战争也还是不可避免的。认为上述这些性质的战争可以避免，是完全错误的，完全不合乎实际的。这种观点使被压迫人民丧失斗志，不准备在敌人进行武装镇压的时候把自己武装起来，去和全副武装的敌人积极地进行斗争，来解放自己，这在实际上是要使被压迫人民只能永远处于受奴役的地位。
    他说，我们主张社会主义国家同资本主义国家之间和平共处。
    从第二次世界大战以来，虽然我们社会主义国家极力争取和平共处，坚持不懈地推行各种和平政策，但是以美国为首的帝国主义一贯坚持冷战政策，坚持扩军备战，制造紧张局势。我们应该告诉人民，不要为帝国主义所进行的冷战吓倒，要坚决地起来反对帝国主义的冷战政策，揭穿帝国主义的丑恶的原形和它进行针锋相对的斗争，这样才有可能使冷战不至于发展为热战。
    我们必须要充分的估计到，帝国主义由于它的内部危机越来越严重，由于它要加强对本国人民和殖民地人民的压迫和统治，它还会长期保持冷战政策，把冷战强加在世界人民的身上，并且继续保持它的强大的军事力量和整个国家机器。所以保卫世界和平反对帝国主义，是各国人民必须长期进行的斗争。
    刘长胜说，我们赞成苏联提出裁军的建议。当然，不能设想，帝国主义会接受全面彻底裁军的建议。提出建议的目的是为了动员全世界人民团结起来，反对帝国主义扩军备战的计划，是为了在全世界人民面前揭穿帝国主义的侵略的、好战的本性，以利于最大限度地孤立以美国为首的帝国主义集团，使它不敢轻易发动战争。现在有人认为，这种建议在帝国主义存在的条件下是可以实现的，依靠这种建议，就能“根绝战争危险”，这是一种不切实际的幻想。至于认为帝国主义在裁军之后，会把节省下来的军费，用来“为劳动群众谋福利”，用来“援助不发达国家”能够“无例外地为全体人民带来普遍进步”，那简直是给帝国主义搽粉，美化帝国主义甚至简直是帮助以美国为首的帝国主义来欺骗世界各国人民。
    他指出，只有在社会主义革命在全世界胜利的时代，才能出现没有战争，没有武器的世界。在帝国主义还存在着，所谓没有武器没有战争的世界是不可设想的。这并不是我们愿意不愿意的问题而是帝国主义绝对不会自动放下武器的问题。帝国主义为了镇压本国的人民，不会放下武器，为了镇压殖民地，不会放下武器，为了对其他国家，进行扩张和侵略，不会放下武器。过去的历史证明了这一点，今后还会证明这一点。
    刘长胜说，我们认为必须力争成立禁止核武器的协定，力求避免世界上一场核武器的战争。现在，苏联已经掌握了核武器，使美帝国主义失掉了原子垄断地位。苏联和各社会主义国家应该继续发展在原子能方面的优势，同时，世界各国人民应该更广泛地展开反对帝国主义，反对核武器的斗争，在这样的条件下才可能达成这种协议。但即使达成了协议，帝国主义也可能把它撕毁。即使它为着本身的利害，不敢发动大规模的核战争，它仍可能使用所谓常规武器来进行战争。因此不管在什么情况下，世界人民都必须对帝国主义保持高度警惕性，不能用天真烂漫的态度去对待美帝国主义和其他帝国主义。
    他说，为了争取世界和平，各国人民的斗争和社会主义国家的外交谈判，这两方面应该互相结合。不能因为要外交谈判就不要人民斗争，相反，外交谈判必须以世界各国人民的团结的斗争做后盾。要争取世界和平，主要的只能依靠各国人民的斗争。应当：不断地壮大社会主义国家的力量，不断地壮大殖民地附属国解放运动的力量；不断地壮大帝国主义国家内部人民革命的力量；不断地揭露以美国为首的帝国主义集团；不断地揭露为帝国主义服务的现代修正主义者；同时要以充分的策略性，利用帝国主义国家之间和各个帝国主义国家内部各个垄断资本集团之间的矛盾。刘长胜在发言结束时说，我们认为，只要通过上面所说的这些努力，在反对帝国主义的战线上，把全世界一切可以团结的力量团结起来，结成广泛的统一战线，我们就一定能够战胜帝国主义好战势力，取得保卫世界和平的伟大胜利。
