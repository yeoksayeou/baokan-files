    The Great Struggle Against the "Security Treaty"
    Noma Hiroshi, Head of the Japanese Writers Delegation to China
    On June 4th, the Japanese people staged a massive struggle centered on a general strike of 5.6 million workers, involving students, citizens, cultural figures, businessmen, and housewives, achieving great success. This unprecedented nationwide struggle marks a new stage in the Japanese people's fight against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." Our delegation is moved and delighted by this.
    In this struggle, the Japanese nation has demonstrated the wisdom and strength befitting an independent nation. From the great progress of this struggle, I feel that everything in Japan is being reformed. This is the first step in fundamentally changing everything in Japan, and it will become a new epoch in Japanese history. Through the achievements of this struggle, the Japanese people have clearly recognized the source of their strength. Therefore, future struggles will surely become more courageous, advancing with unstoppable force.
    The achievements of the Japanese people's struggle, while built on the foundation of past arduous struggles, are also due to the support of the forces of peace in Asia, the democratic forces of the world, and the immense strength of the Chinese people. With the support of these forces, the future struggle will further expand and continue to develop until it deals a thorough blow to American imperialism and the Nobusuke Kishi clique. We are confident that great victory will be achieved in the future.
    The Japanese people's struggle against the new "Security Treaty" is divided into two periods, with the Nobusuke Kishi clique's violent actions in the Diet on the midnight of May 19th as the dividing line. The first period was one of overcoming various difficulties, accumulating the strength of the national struggle, and preparing to expand the struggle. The second period is one of the people rising up and victoriously carrying out the struggle.
    On October 4, 1958, when Japan and the United States held the first round of negotiations to revise the "Security Treaty," it was difficult for people to correctly understand the nature of the new treaty. The terrible content of the revised treaty was masked by the Kishi government's rhetoric, and its true ugly new face was hidden behind the mask of "independence." Some believed that this revision was carried out solely at the behest of the United States, and that the Japanese ruling class was merely forced to accept it. Others believed that this revision was proposed by the Japanese side, and that the Japanese ruling class was making demands on the United States in order to seek independence and autonomy for Japanese imperialism. However, neither of these views was correct. The Japan-U.S. military alliance is actually an alliance in which the United States not only attempts to use its vassal state, Japan, as its base of aggression, but also further wants to use the entire Japanese people as its tools of aggression. The Japanese monopoly capitalist ruling group, on the other hand, attempts to revive militarism through this alliance and relies on American aggressive forces to carry out aggressive expansion that it cannot achieve on its own. This became increasingly clear after the provisions of the new treaty were made public. Because the purpose of revising the treaty was not fully recognized at the outset, the people's struggle, which had not developed sufficiently, launched a united struggle under the leadership of the National Council to Prevent the Revision of the Security Treaty. Members of our "Security Treaty Criticism Association," composed of Japanese writers, scholars, theater workers, painters, film workers, journalists, and lawyers, wore black armbands and held up banners opposing the signing of the treaty, holding demonstrations. The power of this demonstration strongly moved the hearts of the people.
    When the Diet entered the stage of discussing whether or not to approve the new treaty, the struggle developed by leaps and bounds. In the Diet, the Kishi government gradually fell into a predicament due to the questioning of members of the Japan Socialist Party and the Communist Party. First of all, regarding the interpretation of the "Far East" range in Article Four, the government's response to the questioning was very chaotic. When Nobusuke Kishi replied that the Far East included Kinmen and Matsu, the venue immediately fell into an unmanageable state. After newspapers reported these events, the people felt great doubts and concerns about the treaty. Opposition party members conducted an outstanding struggle, seizing on the incident of the American U-2 spy plane invading Soviet airspace and fiercely attacking the government. The opposition party members' struggle in the Diet was closely linked to the unprecedented 17 million signatures of people expressing opposition to the new "Security Treaty," and a united struggle unfolded both inside and outside the Diet.
    The Kishi government, thus besieged, resorted to despicable plots, bringing in 500 policemen to completely drive the opposition party members out of the Diet and "pass" the resolution. However, at this "Security Treaty" Special Committee meeting, the chairman did not take the official chair, and the agenda at the time was not written into the prescribed stenographic record. According to convention, the agenda of the plenary session should of course be voted on by all members, but the ruling party only made decisions by its own party members, and the agenda was not written into the stenographic record. Even from the perspective of parliamentary procedure, this resolution cannot be considered a resolution; it is clearly invalid.
    Anger spread at once. The people rose up. Before that time, the Japanese people's struggle for national independence and democracy had complex circumstances, but on this day, it entered an extraordinary situation, and the struggle became completely simple and clear. The strength of the people was concentrated on one point, impacting American imperialism and the Kishi group with the force of a whirlwind; on June 4th, it opened up a new history at the peak of this anger. It can be said that the Japanese people's struggle is continuing to advance on the road to victory.
    Supported by this struggle, we came to China and experienced firsthand the deep friendship of the Chinese people and their broad-mindedness in considering Asian and world issues.
    We now clearly recognize that the struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance is the struggle of the Japan-China united front. We demand that in the process of this struggle conducted by the united front, in the process of taking this action, we wipe away Japan's past sins one by one. The time when those sins can be completely wiped away will be the time when the Kishi government is overthrown, the American troops are driven away, and an independent and democratic regime is established in Japan, making Japan a new Japan. We know that such a day is coming soon.

### 反对“安全条约”的伟大斗争

    反对“安全条约”的伟大斗争
    日本文学家访华代表团团长  野间宏
    6月4日，日本人民举行了以五百六十万工人总罢工为核心，有学生、市民、文化界人士、商人和主妇参加的大规模的斗争，取得了伟大的成就。这次史无前例的全民性的大规模斗争，标志着日本人民反对新日美“安全条约”的斗争进入了一个新的阶段。我们代表团为此而感动和高兴。
    日本民族在这次斗争中发挥了称得上是一个独立民族的智慧和力量。从这次斗争的伟大进步中，我感觉到日本的一切都在革新。这是从根本上变革日本一切的时代的第一步，它将成为日本历史的新纪元。日本人民通过这次斗争的成就，清楚地认识到斗争力量的源泉所在。因此，今后的斗争一定越来越勇敢，以不可阻挡的力量向前推进。
    日本人民斗争的这种成就，虽然是在过去艰巨的斗争基础上取得的，但是，也是因为得到了亚洲的和平力量、世界的民主力量和中国人民的巨大力量的支援。有了这些力量的支援，今后斗争将进一步扩大，一直向前发展，直到给予美帝国主义和岸信介集团以彻底的打击。我们确信，今后将取得伟大的胜利。
    日本人民反对新“安全条约”的斗争，以5月19日午夜岸信介集团在议会采取暴行为界线，分成前后两个时期。前一个时期是在克服种种困难中，积聚全民斗争力量，准备扩大斗争的时期；后一个时期是全民奋起，胜利地开展斗争的时期。
    1958年10月4日，日美第一次举行修改“安全条约”谈判的时候，人们很难正确地了解新条约的性质。经过修改的条约的可怕内容又被岸政府的花言巧语掩盖着，它的真正丑恶的新面目隐藏在“独立”这个假面具之下。有人认为，这次修改只是根据美国的授意进行的，日本的统治阶级不过是被迫接受。另外有人认为，这次修改是日本方面提出的，是日本统治阶级为了谋求日本帝国主义独立自主而向美国提出的要求。但是，上述两种人都没有说对。日美军事同盟其实是这样一种同盟：美国不但企图把它的仆从国家——日本作为它的侵略基地，而且进一步想利用全体日本人民充当它的侵略工具；而日本的垄断资本统治集团则是企图通过这个同盟，复活军国主义，并且企图依仗美国侵略势力，进行它单靠自己力量无法进行的侵略扩张。这一点从新条约的条文公布以后，就越来越清楚了。由于最初没有能够充分地认识到修改条约的目的，曾经发展得不够充分的人民斗争，就在阻止修改安全条约国民会议的领导下，开展了统一斗争。我们日本的文学家、学者、戏剧工作者、画家、电影工作者、新闻工作者、法律家组成的“安全条约批判会”的会员，曾经把黑色的丧章挂在胸襟上，高举反对在条约上签字的标语牌，举行了游行示威。这次游行示威的力量强烈地打动了人民的心。
    到了议会讨论批准不批准新条约的阶段，斗争就有了飞跃的发展。在议会中，岸政府由于日本社会党、共产党议员的质询而逐步陷于进退维谷的境地。首先，关于条文第四条中的“远东范围”的解释，政府在答复质询的时候非常混乱，当岸信介回答说远东包括金门、马祖的时候，会场顿时陷于无法收拾的状态。在报纸报道了这些事情以后，人民对这项条约感到了极大的疑虑和担忧。在野党议员进行了出色的斗争，他们抓住了美国U—2型间谍飞机侵犯苏联领空的事件，紧紧追问政府，进行猛烈的抨击。在野党议员在议会里进行的斗争，同日本议会史上空前的一千七百万人表示反对新“安全条约”的请愿签名紧紧地结合在一起，国会内外展开了一致的斗争。
    这样遭到围困的岸政府就施展令人深恶痛绝的阴谋诡计，引进五百名警察，把在野党议员完全撵出国会，“通过”决议。但是，在这次“安全条约”特别委员会会议上，委员长并没有就委员长的正式席位，当时的议事内容也没有写进规定的速记记录去。按照惯例，全体会议的议事当然也应当由全体议员投票表决，可是，执政党只由自己的党的议员加以决定，议事内容也没有写进速记记录去。即使从议会的程序看来，也不能说这个决议算是决议，它显然是无效的。
    愤怒一下子扩展开了。人民起来了。在那个时候以前，日本人民争取民族独立和民主的斗争有过复杂的情况，可是，到了这一天，进入了非常局面，斗争完全变得单纯而明确了。人民的力量集中到一点，以疾风迅雷之势冲击美帝国主义和岸集团；到了6月4日，就在这个愤怒的顶峰开辟了新的历史。可以说，日本人民的斗争正在胜利的道路上继续前进。
    我们受到这场斗争的支持，来到了中国，第一次亲身接触到中国人民的深厚的友谊以及他们考虑到亚洲和世界问题的宽广的胸怀。
    我们现在清楚地认识到，反对日美军事同盟的斗争就是日中统一战线的斗争。我们要求在这个由统一战线进行的斗争的过程中，在采取这种行动的过程中，一个一个地擦掉日本过去的罪恶。能够把那些罪恶完全擦掉的时候，那就是打倒岸政府，赶走美军，在日本成立独立和民主的政权，使日本成为新的日本的时候。我们知道那样的一天快要到来了。
