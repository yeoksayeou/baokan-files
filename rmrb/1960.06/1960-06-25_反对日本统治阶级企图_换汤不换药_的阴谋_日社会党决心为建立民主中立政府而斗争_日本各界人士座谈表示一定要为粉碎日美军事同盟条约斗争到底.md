Xinhua News Agency, June 24th, Tokyo dispatch: Cancelling the Japan-U.S. treaty and U.S. military bases is the guarantee of Japan’s independence and peace. The Socialist Party of Japan held a Central Executive Committee meeting today and decided on a political line of struggle to strive for the establishment of a democratic and neutral government in Japan.

The goals of struggle for the new political line include: not recognizing the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," crushing the Japan-U.S. military alliance system, restoring diplomatic relations between Japan and China, concluding a Japan-Soviet peace treaty, establishing peaceful and friendly relations with all countries, and the economic democratization of Japan, as well as the complete implementation of social insurance.

The Socialist Party's political line is aimed at the Japanese ruling class's conspiracy to maintain the Liberal Democratic Party's regime by "changing the soup without changing the ingredients" after Kishi Nobusuke expressed his intention to step down.

The political line stipulates that in order to establish a new government, the Socialist Party intends to maintain contact with all forces that support its political propositions, regardless of whether they are conservative parties.

This political line will be discussed and finalized at the Socialist Party's Central Committee meeting to be held on July 3.

Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd, Tokyo dispatch: The Socialist Party of Japan issued a statement at noon today, stating that it does not recognize the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet's "ratification" of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The statement said that because the Kishi Nobusuke government was afraid of increasing public opposition to the ratification of the new "Security Treaty," it had the cabinet members sign the decision to "ratify" the treaty separately on the evening of June 21, before the U.S. Senate passed the treaty, and secretly affixed the "Imperial Seal" to the treaty.

The Socialist Party expressed its opposition to the government's behavior of creating a "fait accompli."

Xinhua News Agency, June 24th, Tokyo dispatch: Former President of Tokyo University, Tadao Yanaihara, and other prominent social figures issued statements in the "Asahi Shimbun" today regarding Kishi Nobusuke's forced announcement of his decision to resign, demanding that the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet resign en masse immediately, and dissolve the Diet and hold general elections as soon as possible.

Yanaihara Tadao also condemned Kishi Nobusuke for describing the mass movement as "incited by international communist forces" in his resignation statement, trying to shift his responsibility to the masses in order to strengthen suppression. He emphasized that the fact is that the Japanese people stood up bravely to defend democracy.

Commentator Ayako Ishigaki said that Kishi Nobusuke is the worst politician. The current chaotic situation in Japan was caused by him, he should apologize to the people and resign immediately, but Kishi Nobusuke did not say when he would resign, and no one is more cunning than him.

University Professor Hirotatsu Fujiwara said that it can be seen from Kishi Nobusuke's resignation statement that Kishi Nobusuke is reluctant to relinquish power and wants to maintain his influence on the next regime.

Fujiwara pointed out that Kishi Nobusuke declared in his statement that "it is necessary to strongly promote new policies that can adapt to the internal and external situation," which means that he wants to formulate "public security laws" and "anti-strike laws."

Xinhua News Agency, June 24th, Tokyo dispatch: People from all walks of life in Japan unanimously stated at a symposium held by Tokyo Radio on the evening of the 23rd that they would base themselves on the achievements of the past struggle against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," strengthen their confidence in victory, and fight to the end to crush the new "Security Treaty" and force the dissolution of the Diet.

People from six major cities in Japan participated in the symposium.

Professor Yasumasa Hayakawa of Hokkaido University said that the students of Hokkaido University have stopped striking and returned to school, preparing to launch a long-term struggle to crush the "Security Treaty" system. He said that the Japanese people should use past struggles' experiences and lessons and continue to struggle to win the final victory, especially to win the upcoming general election.

Harai Iku, a housewife living in Sendai, pointed out that through the struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty," the Japanese people's political awareness has been greatly improved, and their struggle is full of bright prospects. She said that the Japanese reactionaries seem powerful, but there is nothing to fear in the face of the people's just struggle. She emphasized that we resolutely oppose the emergence of a government similar to the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, and at the same time, we must resolutely prevent the reactionaries' conspiracy to revise the constitution from succeeding.

Yaeko Takeuchi, a housewife living in Nagoya, said that the new "Security Treaty" was created by Kishi Nobusuke, and the people absolutely do not recognize it. Through struggle, we have learned that "women's silence" was once used by Kishi Nobusuke, but now we understand that as long as we unite, the power of women cannot be insulted. She said that in the future, Japanese women will join the people of the whole country to force the Diet to dissolve as soon as possible.

She criticized Kishi Nobusuke for insisting in his resignation speech that "maintaining order is the most urgent task at present." She said that it is not the people who are disrupting order, but Kishi Nobusuke himself.

Shinichi Asayama, a professor at Osaka City University, pointed out that Kishi Nobusuke was forced to announce his upcoming resignation, which is a victory for the people's struggle. It is unprecedented in the world for a war criminal to be prime minister, and we must prevent people like Kishi Nobusuke from forming a cabinet. He said that in Osaka, not only workers and intellectuals, but also many capitalists are demanding the Diet to dissolve as soon as possible.

Jozuru Shimazaki, an associate professor at Kyushu University, pointed out that the people's struggle forced Eisenhower to stop his visit to Japan and forced Kishi Nobusuke to resign, which strengthened the confidence of the broad masses of the Japanese people in the final victory. He said that many professors and associate professors at Kyushu University have held meetings to discuss future struggle strategies.

Okakura Koshio, the host of the symposium, emphasized that the broad masses of the people said that the achievements of the struggle encouraged them and made them stronger, and in the future, they will wholeheartedly engage in struggle and fight to the end to achieve their goals. (Attached picture)

    取消日美条约和美军基地是日本独立和平的保证
    反对日本统治阶级企图“换汤不换药”的阴谋
    日社会党决心为建立民主中立政府而斗争
    日本各界人士座谈表示一定要为粉碎日美军事同盟条约斗争到底
    新华社24日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天举行中央执行委员会会议，决定了为争取在日本建立民主和中立政府而斗争的政治路线。
    新政治路线的斗争目标包括：不承认新日美“安全条约”、粉碎日美军事同盟体系、恢复日中邦交、缔结日苏和约、同一切国家建立和平友好关系和日本的经济民主化以及完全实行社会保险。
    社会党的这一政治路线，是针对日本统治阶级在岸信介表示要下台后企图以“换汤不换药”的手法保持自由民主党的政权这一阴谋而提出的。
    这项政治路线规定，为了建立新政府，社会党打算同赞成它的政治主张的一切力量保持联系，不管是不是保守政党。
    这项政治路线将在7月3日举行的社会党中央委员会会议上讨论和最后决定。
    新华社22日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天中午发表声明，表示不承认岸信介内阁“批准”的新日美“安全条约”。
    声明说，岸信介政府由于害怕公众越来越反对批准新“安全条约”，便在美国参议院通过这个条约之前，在6月21日晚上使内阁阁员们分别签署了“批准”这个条约的决定，并且偷偷地在这个条约上盖上了“御玺”。
    社会党表示反对政府制造“既成事实”的行为。
    新华社24日讯　东京消息：日本前东京大学校长矢内原忠雄等社会知名人士今天在“朝日新闻”上就岸信介被迫宣布决定辞职一事发表谈话，要求岸信介内阁立即全体辞职，并且尽速解散国会和举行大选。
    矢内原忠雄还谴责岸信介在辞职声明中把群众运动说成是“受到国际共产势力的煽动”，想把自己的责任转嫁到群众身上，来加强镇压。他强调说，事实是，日本人民是为了保卫民主而奋勇站起来的。
    评论家石垣绫子说，岸信介是最坏的政治家。目前日本国内的混乱局势是由他引起的，他应该向人民请罪并立即辞职，然而岸信介却没有说出什么时候要辞职，没有人比他更狡猾了。
    大学教授藤原弘达说，从岸信介的辞职声明中可以看出，岸信介对政权留恋不舍并想保持自己对下届政权的影响。
    藤原指出，岸信介在声明中宣称“要强烈推进能够适应内外形势的新政策”，这意味着他想制定“治安法律”和“禁止罢工法律”。
    新华社24日讯　东京消息：日本各界人士在东京广播电台23日晚上举行的座谈会上一致表示，他们将以过去反对修改日美“安全条约”斗争的成就为基础，坚定胜利信心，为粉碎新“安全条约”和迫使解散国会而斗争到底。
    参加座谈会的有日本六大城市的人士。
    北海道大学教授早川泰正说，北海道大学的学生们已停止罢课回到学校，准备展开粉碎“安全条约”体系的长期斗争。他说，日本人民应该运用过去的斗争经验和教训，继续展开斗争，争取最后胜利，尤其是争取即将到来的大选的胜利。
    住在仙台的家庭妇女原伊久指出，通过反对修改“安全条约”的斗争，日本人民的政治觉悟有了很大的提高，他们的斗争充满着光明的前途。她说，日本反动派看起来好像强大，但在人民正义斗争面前没有可怕的地方。她强调说，我们坚决反对出现与岸信介内阁相差不多的政府，同时必须坚决阻止反动派修改宪法的阴谋得逞。
    住在名古屋的家庭妇女竹内八重子说，新“安全条约”是由岸信介一手制造出来的，人民绝对不承认它。通过斗争，我们才知道“妇女的沉默”曾经被岸信介所利用，但是现在我们明白，只要团结起来，妇女的力量是不可侮的。她说，今后日本妇女要和全国人民一道，迫使尽速解散国会。
    她抨击岸信介在表示辞职的谈话中硬说“维持秩序是当前最紧要的任务”。她说，搅乱秩序的不是人民，而是岸信介自己。
    大阪市立大学教授朝山新一指出，岸信介被迫不得不宣布将要辞职，这是人民斗争的胜利。战犯当首相在世界上史无前例，我们必须阻止岸信介之类的人物来组织内阁。他说，在大阪，不仅工人和知识分子、而且许多资本家也在要求尽速解散国会。
    九州大学副教授岛崎让指出，人民的斗争迫使艾森豪威尔停止访日，迫使岸信介要辞职，这就使日本广大人民坚定了最后胜利的信心。他说，九州大学有许多教授和副教授曾经召开会议讨论了今后的斗争方针。
    这次座谈会的主持人冈仓古志郎强调说，广大人民都说斗争的成就鼓舞着他们，使他们力量倍增，今后要一心一意来搞斗争，为实现目标斗争到底。（附图片）
