Growing Up in Struggle
    ——A Brief Discussion of the Children's Film "Underground Young Pioneers"
    Jiang Huai
    For today's adults, the white terror, hunger, unemployment, soaring prices, and inability to pay tuition under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang are like events from another world. For today's children, they are even more unseen, at most learned from stories or comic books. To tell today's children about the revolutionary struggle led by the Party and the enemy's atrocities through artistic images is indeed a very important and meaningful thing. Therefore, we welcome the release of "Underground Young Pioneers."
    It writes about children's affairs, but it is equally attractive and educational to adults. Look at how the Party cares for our next generation! Even in such a treacherous environment and intense struggle, the Party did not relax its educational work for children and teenagers. When the sky over Shanghai was still full of dark clouds, the Party published the "New Young Pioneer News," using all possible means allowed by the environment at the time to educate and organize children, teaching them to recognize the situation, and teaching them some revolutionary principles (what we see in the film is only one aspect of this work). Yang Ming, an underground worker of the Party, not only provided revolutionary education to the children, but also, according to the Party's instructions, further organized them to do many things within their capabilities, directly participating in the struggle to overthrow the Kuomintang reactionaries. When we see how children gradually grow strong in the struggle and become a red revolutionary reserve force, we will deeply understand how serious and meticulous the work of cultivating and educating the next generation of revolution is! The lofty ideals of communism, the excellent qualities of revolutionaries, and the noble feelings of dedicating oneself to the cause of human liberation must not rely on greenhouse cultivation or on arranging all kinds of excellent material conditions for them, but must guide them to participate in the nationwide revolutionary movement and the great struggle to transform society and nature. Only from this harsh soil can the seedlings of outstanding communist successors grow. This was the case in the "Underground Young Pioneers" era, and it is still the case today when we already have fifty million Young Pioneers.
    If there is anything to ask of the film, it is that the scope of the children's activities could be wider and the content of the activities could be more substantial. In that way, the portrayal of the spiritual outlook of these underground Young Pioneers and their leaders, the reflection of the arduous and complex underground struggle before liberation, and the educational effect on the children might be more complete. For example, some of the material in this film is based on the deeds of the "Newsboy Guard" at the time, and the activities of the "Newsboy Guard" were not just distributing leaflets. They also took the opportunity to deliver newspapers to scout and investigate the enemy's camps and warehouses. For example, in schools, the "Underground Young Pioneers" also used names such as "Timur Squad" to mobilize children to do "anonymous good deeds" and unite more children around them. This material could be used. If that were the case, the actors (including adults and children) would have more room to maneuver.

    在斗争里成长
    ——简谈儿童片“地下少先队”
    江怀
    对于今天的成年人说来，国民党反动统治下的白色恐怖、饥饿、失业、物价暴涨、交不起学费这些事，已经是恍如隔世；而对今天的孩子们说来，更是见所未见，最多也是从小说故事或者连环画册里看到一些。通过艺术形象，告诉今天的孩子们党领导的革命斗争事迹和敌人的暴行，实在是一件非常重要而又非常有意义的事情。因此，我们欢迎“地下少先队”的上映。
    写的是孩子们的事，但是对成年人同样有吸引力，有教育作用。你看，党是如何关心我们的下一代！即使是环境那么险恶、斗争那么紧张的时候，党也没有放松对少年儿童的教育工作。在上海的天空还满布着乌云的时候，党出版了“新少年报”，用当时环境里所能允许的各种方式教育和组织孩子们，教育他们认清局势，教他们懂得一些革命道理（我们在电影里看到的，只是其中的一项工作）。党的地下工作者杨明，不仅向孩子们进行革命的教育，更按照党的指示，进一步把他们组织起来，做许多他们力所能及的工作，直接地参加了打倒国民党反动派的斗争。当我们看到孩子们如何在斗争里逐渐坚强成长为红色的革命后备军的时候，我们会深深地懂得：对革命下一代的培养教育，是一件多么严肃而又细致的工作！共产主义的远大理想，革命者的优良品质，为人类解放事业献身的崇高感情，决不能依靠温室的培植，依靠为他们安排好各种各样优异的物质条件，而是要引导他们参加全民性的革命运动，参加改造社会和改造自然的伟大斗争。只有从这种严峻的土壤中，才能生长出优秀的共产主义接班人的幼苗来。在“地下少先队”时代是如此，在我们已经有五千万红领巾的今天也是如此。
    如果说对影片还有所要求的话，就觉得孩子们活动的范围，还可以更广阔些，活动内容还可以更充实些。那样，对刻划这群地下少先队员和他们的领导人的精神面貌，对反映解放前夕的艰苦复杂的地下斗争，对孩子们所起的教育作用，也许将会更丰满些。比如，这部影片有一部分材料是根据当时的“报童近卫军”的事迹写的，“报童近卫军”的活动，便不只是散发传单。他们还借送报之便，侦察和调查了敌人的军营和仓库。比如在学校里，“地下少先队”还用“铁木儿团”等名义，发动孩子做“不知名的好事”，把更多的孩子团结在自己的周围，这些材料都可以利用。如果那样的话，演员（包括演成年人的和演孩子的）就更有活动的天地了。
