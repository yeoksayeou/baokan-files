Xinhua News Agency, June 1st: Comrade Lu Dingyi's Congratulatory Speech on Behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council at the National Congress of Advanced Units and Advanced Workers in Socialist Construction in Education, Culture, Health, Sports, and News

(June 1, 1960)

Fellow Representatives, Comrades:

On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council of the People's Republic of China, I extend warm congratulations to the National Congress of Advanced Units and Advanced Workers in Socialist Construction in Education, Culture, Health, Sports, and News. And through you, I extend warm congratulations to the more than seven million professional cultural and educational workers and the more than thirty million amateur cultural and educational workers across the country.

The emergence of many advanced units and advanced workers on the cultural and educational front marks that China's cultural revolution has begun to achieve great success, and that a contingent of cultural and educational cadres with proletarian intellectuals as the backbone has begun to take shape. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council of the People's Republic of China believe that such a conference should be convened to commend the advanced, exchange experiences, strengthen unity, boost morale, and push China's cultural revolution to a new upsurge, to cooperate with the great leap forward in China's industrial and agricultural production, to cooperate with the people's commune movement in rural and urban areas, to cooperate with the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and greatly promote China's socialist construction.

The characteristic of the new China's cultural and educational undertakings lies first in its opposition to imperialism, and its irreconcilable opposition to imperialist "civilization." As everyone knows, it was precisely the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism that made the great motherland with a long history of culture and a population accounting for a quarter of the world become a "poor and blank" country, a country with very backward culture and education. The imperialists have tried their best to spread their so-called "civilization," their so-called "Western culture," their so-called "freedom, equality, fraternity," and their so-called "democratic individualism," the purpose of which is nothing more than to paralyze the working people of the imperialist countries, to make them content with the status quo and endure exploitation, and not to make revolution; it is nothing more than to paralyze the people of the colonial and semi-colonial countries all over the world, to make them content with backwardness and endure aggression, and not to overthrow the rule of imperialism and colonialism. These things of theirs are nothing but despicable and shameless deceptions, and endless disasters, for the oppressed nations and the broad masses of working people all over the world. The imperialists and their running dogs have committed heinous crimes against the people of our country, but instead they slander us as an "inferior nation," as the "sick man of East Asia," saying that we should endure inhuman plunder and exploitation and should not rise up to resist and make revolution. The people of our country suffered to the full the bitterness of imperialist "civilization" before they accepted the ideas of Marxism-Leninism, and only under the leadership of the Communist Party of China did they overthrow the heinous rule of imperialism and its running dogs, establishing the People's Republic of China led by the proletariat and based on the worker-peasant alliance . Revolution and Revolution only, enabled our people to achieve emancipation politically, economically, and culturally.

Our experience tells the people of the whole country, the cultural and educational workers of the whole country, and also all the oppressed nations and their intellectuals all over the world: the contradiction between the oppressed nations and imperialism is a life-and-death contradiction. There is no and never will be any relationship of "active coexistence" and "friendly cooperation" of "I live and you live" between the oppressed nations and the imperialists. The Yugoslav revisionist group headed by Tito whitewashes imperialism, especially US imperialism and its ringleader Eisenhower, and says that this is "creatively developing Marxism-Leninism," otherwise it is "rigid dogmatism." This is complete nonsense and a shameless slander of Marxism-Leninism. The "theory" of the Tito revisionist group is extremely similar to the arguments of China's comprador bourgeoisie, and is the "theory" of imperialist running dogs.

The characteristic of the new China's cultural and educational undertakings also lies in the fact that it is led by the proletariat, not by the bourgeoisie. Historical facts have proven that in socialist countries, the leadership of cultural and educational undertakings can still be in the hands of bourgeois intellectuals. They copy bourgeois educational theories, literary and artistic theories, etc., and pass them off as socialist goods to confuse the people, especially to confuse the younger generation, hinder the development of socialist revolution and socialist construction, and prepare conditions for the restoration of capitalism. The imperialists headed by the United States hope that in socialist countries, as the people's cultural education improves, bourgeois ideas will become popular. In addition to using all their propaganda tools to spread reactionary imperialist culture to socialist countries, the imperialists also hope that we will spread bourgeois pacifism through literary works, movies, and other artistic works and propaganda publications, paralyze the people's vigilance against the war and aggression policies of US imperialism, relax the mass struggle of the broad masses of people for peace, and cause the broad masses of people to be caught off guard when imperialism launches a war, so that imperialism can achieve the effect of a sudden attack. The imperialists also hope that we will abandon the Marxist-Leninist method of class analysis, spread the fallacies of bourgeois humanitarianism, spread the false impression that bourgeois culture is perfect and unattainable, so that our people will bow down before bourgeois "civilization," be content with being downstream, and weaken our people's revolutionary will. Our cultural and educational workers must pay serious attention to this grand conspiracy of imperialism to disintegrate our fighting spirit and "peacefully evolve" socialist society into capitalism. In order to smash this conspiracy of the imperialists headed by the United States, it is necessary to establish, consolidate, and strengthen the leadership of the Communist Party in cultural and educational work. The process of the development of China's cultural and educational undertakings over the past eleven years is the process of the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for leadership. This struggle is manifested in education work, cultural work, news work, and even health work and sports work. The struggle against the bourgeois rightists in 1957 and the struggle against right-leaning opportunism within the Communist Party in 1959 were fierce class struggles on the political and ideological fronts. It is because our Party and the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, smashed the rampant attacks of the bourgeois rightists and right-leaning opportunists within the Party, that China could achieve a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the emergence of people's communes in rural and urban areas, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and the great leap forward in cultural and educational work.

Comrade Mao Zedong told us as early as 1957 that after the socialist revolution on the economic front was basically completed, "the struggle to decide whether socialism or capitalism will win in the ideological field will still take a considerable period of time to resolve. This is because the influence of the bourgeoisie and intellectuals from the old society will continue to exist in our country for a long time, and as the ideology of the class, it will continue to exist in our country for a long time." China's cultural revolution is only just beginning. The cultural revolution is endless, and as long as human society exists, this revolution will continue to be carried out. And before the construction of a communist society is completed, the main content of the cultural revolution is the struggle to determine whether socialism or capitalism will win in the ideological field.

In order to realize communism, it is required that social products be extremely abundant, and at the same time, it is required that the communist ideological awareness and moral qualities of all the people be greatly improved, and that universal education be popularized and improved. To achieve a great improvement in the communist ideological awareness and moral qualities of all the people, it is necessary to thoroughly eliminate the political and ideological influence of the bourgeoisie among all the people. To achieve the popularization and improvement of universal education, it is necessary not only to eliminate illiteracy and popularize primary and secondary education, but also to popularize higher education. For all of us cultural and educational workers, this is an extremely arduous and extremely glorious task. We must make long-term, practical, persistent, and unremitting efforts to realize these great tasks under the leadership of the Communist Party of China.

The cultural revolution is the intellectualization of the worker-peasant masses and the laborization of intellectuals. The view that the cultural revolution is only the intellectualization of the worker-peasant masses and that the laborization of intellectuals is not necessary is one-sided and therefore wrong. Since we implemented the policy of literary and art workers participating in labor and combining education with productive labor, it has only been two to three years, but cultural and educational work has already shown a new atmosphere. Many people who previously held skeptical attitudes have now been largely convinced by the facts. In the future, we must continue to implement this policy. All of us cultural and educational workers must know that all social wealth must be created through human physical labor. This was the case in the past, it is the case now, and it will be the case in the future. The exploiting classes despise physical labor and physical laborers. We must regard physical labor as the primary need of human life. We want to make the people of the whole country become socialist-conscious, cultured laborers.

All of us cultural and educational workers must strive to study Marxism-Leninism, study Comrade Mao Zedong's works, and carry out constant transformation in our thinking. The movement to study Comrade Mao Zedong's works and dialectical materialism, which is now being widely launched throughout the country, is a great communist movement on the ideological front, and has extremely far-reaching implications. We should actively support and continue to carry out this movement.

In our country, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, a contingent of cultural and educational workers with proletarian intellectuals as the backbone has begun to take shape, and the upsurge of the cultural revolution has arrived. Our advanced workers have the responsibility to unite all those who can be united and push the cultural revolution to a new upsurge. We must carry out resolute struggles against imperialism and its running dogs, including modern revisionists, and within the people, we must adopt the method of unity-criticism-unity and the method of active assistance to correctly resolve contradictions. In the fields of literature, art, and academia, we must adhere to the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." While boosting our morale and striving for progress, we must pay attention to the principle of combining work and rest. While daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, we must pay attention to everything being tested. We must have lofty ambitions, and at the same time, we must pay attention to a down-to-earth work style.

Cultural and educational workers throughout the country unite under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live the cultural revolution!

    陆定一同志代表中共中央和国务院在全国文教群英大会上的祝词
    新华社1日讯　陆定一同志代表中共中央和国务院在全国教育和文化、卫生、体育、新闻方面社会主义建设先进单位和先进工作者代表大会上的祝词
    （一九六○年六月一日）各位代表，各位同志：
    我代表中国共产党中央委员会和中华人民共和国国务院，向全国教育和文化、卫生、体育、新闻方面社会主义建设先进单位和先进工作者代表大会致热烈的祝贺。并且通过你们，向全国七百多万专业的文化教育工作者和三千多万业余的文化教育工作者，致热烈的祝贺。
    文化教育战线上许多先进单位和先进工作者的出现，标志着我国的文化革命已经开始取得巨大的成绩，标志着以无产阶级知识分子为骨干的文化教育干部队伍已经开始形成。中国共产党中央委员会和中华人民共和国国务院，认为应该召集这样一个大会，表扬先进，交流经验，加强团结，鼓足干劲，把我国的文化革命，推向一个新的高潮，来配合我国工农业生产的大跃进，配合乡村和城市的人民公社化运动，配合技术革新和技术革命运动，大大地促进我国的社会主义建设。
    新中国文化教育事业的特点，首先在于它是反对帝国主义的，是同帝国主义的“文明”势不两立的。大家知道，正是帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的反动统治，使得有悠久文化的、人口占世界四分之一的伟大祖国，成为“一穷二白”的国家，成为文化教育非常落后的国家。帝国主义者竭力传播他们的所谓“文明”，所谓“西方文化”，所谓“自由、平等、博爱”，所谓“民主个人主义”，其目的无非是要麻痹帝国主义国家的劳动人民，使他们安于现状，忍受剥削，不要革命；无非是要麻痹全世界殖民地半殖民地国家的人民，使他们安于落后，忍受侵略，不要推翻帝国主义、殖民主义的统治。他们的这些东西，对于全世界被压迫民族和广大劳动人民来说，就是卑鄙无耻的欺骗，就是无穷无尽的灾难。帝国主义及其走狗对我国人民犯下了滔天罪行，却反而污蔑我们是“劣等民族”，是“东亚病夫”，说我们应该忍受惨无人道的掠夺和剥削而不应该起来反抗，起来革命。我国人民吃尽了帝国主义“文明”的苦头，才接受了马克思列宁主义的思想，才在中国共产党的领导之下推翻了帝国主义及其走狗的万恶统治，建立起无产阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的中华人民共和国。革命，而且只有革命，才使我国人民能够在政治上得到翻身，在经济上得到翻身，在文化上也得到翻身。
    我们的经验，告诉全国人民，告诉全国文化教育工作者，也告诉全世界一切被压迫民族及其知识分子：被压迫民族同帝国主义的矛盾，是你死我活的矛盾。在被压迫民族与帝国主义者之间，决没有也决不会有什么“我活你也活”的“积极共处”的“友好合作”的关系。以铁托为首的南斯拉夫修正主义集团，为帝国主义特别为美帝国主义及其头子艾森豪威尔涂脂擦粉，并且说，这就是“创造性地发展马克思列宁主义”，否则就是“僵硬的教条主义”。这完全是胡说，是对马克思列宁主义的无耻到极点的污蔑。铁托修正主义集团的“理论”，同我国买办资产阶级的论调极其相似，是帝国主义走狗的“理论”。
    新中国文化教育事业的特点，又在于它是由无产阶级领导的，而不是由资产阶级领导的。历史的事实证明，在社会主义的国家里，文化教育事业的领导权，仍然可以掌握在资产阶级知识分子的手里，他们把资产阶级的教育理论、文艺理论等照抄过来，冒充社会主义的货色，来迷惑人民，特别是迷惑青年一代，阻碍社会主义革命和社会主义建设的发展，并为资本主义的复辟准备条件。以美国为首的帝国主义者希望，在社会主义国家里，随着人民的文化教养的提高，资产阶级思想会流行起来。帝国主义者除了用它们的一切宣传工具，向社会主义国家传布反动的帝国主义文化以外，还希望我们通过文学、电影等艺术作品和宣传刊物，散布资产阶级的和平主义，麻痹人民对于美帝国主义战争政策、侵略政策的警惕，使广大人民放松争取和平的群众斗争，使广大人民在帝国主义一旦发动战争的时候，因为没有精神准备而陷于措手不及，使帝国主义收到突然袭击的效果。帝国主义者还希望我们抛弃马克思列宁主义的阶级分析的方法，散布资产阶级人道主义的谬论，散布资产阶级文化尽善尽美高不可攀的错误印象，使我们的人民，拜倒在资产阶级“文明”的面前，甘居下游，使我们人民的革命意志衰退下来。我们的文化教育工作者，必须严重注意帝国主义这个瓦解我们的斗志和使社会主义社会向资本主义“和平演变”的大阴谋。为了粉碎以美国为首的帝国主义者的这个阴谋，必须在文化教育工作中建立、巩固和加强共产党的领导。十一年来，我国文化教育事业发展的过程，就是无产阶级同资产阶级争夺领导权的斗争过程。这种斗争，表现在教育工作中，文化工作中，新闻工作中，以至卫生工作和体育工作中。1957年反对资产阶级右派的斗争，和1959年共产党内反对右倾机会主义的斗争，曾经是政治战线上和思想战线上的激烈的阶级斗争。由于我们的党和全国人民，在中共中央和毛泽东同志的领导之下，粉碎了资产阶级右派和党内右倾机会主义分子的猖狂进攻，我国才能出现工农业生产的大跃进，出现乡村和城市的人民公社，出现技术革新和技术革命运动，出现文化教育工作的大跃进。
    毛泽东同志在1957年就告诉我们，在经济战线上社会主义革命基本完成以后，“社会主义和资本主义之间在意识形态方面的谁胜谁负的斗争，还需要一个相当长的时间才能解决。这是因为资产阶级和从旧社会来的知识分子的影响还要在我国长期存在，作为阶级的意识形态，还要在我国长期存在”。我国的文化革命，还仅仅是开始。文化革命，是无穷无尽的，只要人类社会存在，这个革命就会不断地进行下去。而在共产主义社会建成以前，文化革命的主要内容，是社会主义和资本主义之间在意识形态方面谁胜谁负的斗争。
    为了实现共产主义，就要求社会产品的极大丰富，同时也要求全体人民的共产主义思想觉悟和道德品质的极大提高，要求全民教育的普及和提高。要做到全体人民的共产主义思想觉悟和道德品质的极大提高，就需要在全体人民中彻底肃清资产阶级的政治影响和思想影响。要做到全民教育的普及和提高，就不仅要扫除文盲，普及中小学教育，而且要普及高等教育。对我们全体文化教育工作者来说，这是极其艰巨的又是极其光荣的任务。我们要以长期的切切实实的坚持不懈的努力，在中国共产党的领导之下，实现这些伟大任务。
    文化革命，是工农群众知识化，和知识分子劳动化。那种认为文化革命只是工农群众知识化，用不着知识分子劳动化的意见，是片面性的，因而是错误的。自从我们实行文艺工作者参加劳动，和教育与生产劳动相结合的方针以来，还只有两年到三年的时间，但是文化教育工作已经显出一派新气象。许多从前抱着怀疑态度的人，现在也大部分被事实所说服了。今后，我们要继续贯彻执行这个方针。我们全体文化教育工作者必须知道，一切社会财富，都必须经过人的体力劳动才能创造出来。过去如此，现在如此，将来也是如此。剥削阶级贱视体力劳动和体力劳动者。我们要把体力劳动看作人类生活的第一需要。我们要使全国人民，成为有社会主义觉悟的、有文化的劳动者。
    我们全体文化教育工作者，必须努力学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛泽东同志的著作，在思想上进行不断的改造。现在在全国广泛开展的学习毛泽东同志著作、学习辩证唯物主义的运动，是思想战线上的伟大的共产主义运动，有极其深远的意义，应当积极支持和继续开展这个运动。
    在我国，在中国共产党的领导之下，以无产阶级知识分子为骨干的文化教育工作队伍已经开始形成，文化革命的高潮已经到来。我们的先进工作者，有责任来团结一切可能团结的人，把文化革命推向一个新的高潮。我们必须同帝国主义及其走狗，包括现代修正主义者在内，进行坚决的斗争，而在人民内部，必须采取团结——批评——团结的方法，采取积极帮助的方法，来正确地解决矛盾。在文艺和学术领域中，必须坚持“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的政策。在鼓足干劲、力争上游的同时，必须注意劳逸结合的原则。在敢想、敢说、敢做的同时，必须注意一切经过试验。我们必须有雄心壮志，同时必须注意踏踏实实的工作作风。
    全国文化教育工作者在毛泽东思想的旗帜之下团结起来！
    文化革命万岁！
