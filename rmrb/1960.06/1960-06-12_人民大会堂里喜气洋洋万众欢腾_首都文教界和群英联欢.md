Xinhua News Agency, June 11th: Over ten thousand cultural and educational workers from central and Beijing municipal cultural and educational units, along with all the representatives attending the National Conference of Advanced Workers in Culture and Education, held a grand celebratory gala this evening at the Great Hall of the People to warmly celebrate the conference's successful conclusion. The cultural and educational workers of the capital enthusiastically sent off the heroes from all fronts, wishing them well as they returned to their posts to ignite even greater upsurges in the cultural and educational revolutions.

At the large-scale celebratory gala, the representatives were warmly welcomed by the masses. Wherever they went, bursts of enthusiastic applause erupted, filling the entire Great Hall with joy, jubilation, and festivities.

In the main auditorium, the representatives watched the renowned performing artist Mei Lanfang perform the Peking Opera "Mu Guiying Takes Command." In the opera, Mei Lanfang portrayed the middle-aged Mu Guiying, a seasoned warrior who had endured many hardships. In the first half of the performance, he utilized the Peking Opera Qingyi's performance techniques, focusing on portraying Mu Guiying's contradictory and complex inner world. The second half perfectly depicted Mu Guiying's loyal and brave demeanor as a general. Mei Lanfang's exquisite performance was warmly praised by all the representatives.

The Shanghai Experimental Opera Troupe, performing in Beijing, staged seven performances of the historical dance drama "The Small Swords Society" in the small auditorium on the third floor for the conference representatives. The plot depicts Shanghai in the autumn of 1853, where Qing dynasty soldiers arbitrarily oppressed the people, extorting money and grain. Enraged, the masses, led by the leaders of the Small Swords Society, launched a vigorous armed uprising. This dance drama, with its strong anti-imperialist and anti-feudal content, was unanimously praised by the representatives.

In the central hall on the third floor, there were table tennis and gymnastics performances. Yu Liefeng, the all-around champion of the National Games, and Qi Yufang, the balance beam champion of the National Games, performed pommel horse, balance beam, and floor exercises for the representatives present. The table tennis exhibition match featured world champion Rong Guotuan and Qiu Zhonghui, the women's singles champion of this year's national exhibition tournament. Their brilliant performances continuously garnered enthusiastic applause from the audience. In particular, the table tennis exhibition match between Rong Guotuan and Jiang Yongning, with its alternating attacks and defenses, was very intense and welcomed by the audience.

The banquet hall was brightly lit, and the music was melodious. The representatives and the capital's cultural and educational workers danced happily. During the dance, representatives attending the conference, including Cantonese opera star Hong Xiannv, Henan opera star Chang Xiangyu, Huangmei opera star Yan Fengying, and Ma Cailou, sang excerpts from their signature works, adding to the joyful atmosphere of the dance.

The representatives also watched variety shows performed by the Central Broadcasting Rap Group and films.

The celebratory gala continued until late into the night before everyone dispersed in high spirits.

    新华社11日讯　中央和北京市文教单位的一万多名文化教育工作者，今晚同出席全国文教先进工作者代表大会的全体代表，在人民大会堂举行盛大的联欢晚会，热烈庆祝大会胜利闭幕。首都文教工作者热诚地欢送各路英雄回到自己的工作岗位，掀起更大的文化革命和教育革命的高潮。
    在规模盛大的联欢晚会上，代表们受到群众的热烈欢迎。他们走到哪里，哪里就响起一阵阵热烈的掌声，整个大会堂喜气洋洋，万众欢腾。
    在大礼堂里，代表们观看了著名表演艺术家梅兰芳演出的京剧“穆桂英挂帅”。梅兰芳在剧中扮演了久战沙场、饱经忧患的中年穆桂英，他在前半出运用京剧青衣的表演技巧，着重刻划了穆桂英矛盾复杂的内心世界；后半出完美地表现了穆桂英忠勇的大将风度。梅兰芳的精湛表演，获得了全体代表的热烈赞扬。
    来京演出的上海实验歌剧院，在三楼小礼堂里为大会代表演出七场历史舞剧“小刀会”。剧情是描写1853年秋天的上海，清朝官兵恣意地欺压百姓，勒逼钱粮，愤怒的群众在小刀会领袖的率领下，爆发的一场轰轰烈烈的人民武装起义运动。这个具有强烈的反帝反封建内容的舞剧，受到代表们一致好评。
    在三楼中央大厅里，有乒乓球表演和体操表演。全运会全能冠军于烈峰和全运会平衡木冠军戚玉芳等，为到会代表表演了鞍马、平衡木和自由体操等节目。乒乓球表演赛中，有世界冠军容国团和今年举行的全国表演赛女子单打冠军丘钟惠等。他们精采的表演，不断地博得全场观众热烈的掌声。特别是容国团对姜永宁的一场乒乓球表演赛，一攻一守，打得十分紧张，受到观众的欢迎。
    宴会厅里灯火辉煌，乐声悠扬，代表们和首都的文教工作者愉快地翩翩起舞。出席大会的代表，粤剧名演员红线女、豫剧名演员常香玉、黄梅戏名演员严凤英和麻采楼等，在舞会进行中演唱了他们的拿手好戏中的精采片断，增加了舞会的欢乐的气氛。
    代表们还观看了中央广播说唱团演出的曲艺节目和电影。
    联欢晚会一直持续到深夜，才尽欢而散。
