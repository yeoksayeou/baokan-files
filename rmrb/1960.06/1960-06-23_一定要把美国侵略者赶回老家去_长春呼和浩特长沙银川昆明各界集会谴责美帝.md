Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd: People from all walks of life in Changchun, Hohhot, Changsha, Yinchuan, and Kunming have held rallies in recent days, angrily condemning Eisenhower's bandit trip and resolutely supporting the anti-American armed demonstrations by the People's Liberation Army's Fujian Front troops.

The local organizations of various democratic parties, people's organizations, and various organs, enterprises, and schools in Jilin Province and Changchun City have held meetings these days to strongly condemn the "plague god" Eisenhower's bandit trip. On the afternoon of the 20th, the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) held a meeting. Feng Zhanhai, Deputy Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) Jilin Provincial Committee, said that Eisenhower's bandit trip was a war provocation against the people of the Far East. He expressed his firm support for the armed demonstrations by the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front to bombard the war "plague god." Guan Mengjue, Deputy Chairman of the China Democratic League (CDL) Jilin Provincial Committee, said that Eisenhower's Far East bandit trip further showed that U.S. imperialism is moving from failure to failure. Taiwan must be liberated, and U.S. imperialism will certainly be driven back to its old home by the people of Asia. Ma Jinqing, Deputy Chairman of the China National Democratic Construction Association (CNDCA) Jilin Provincial Committee, Wu Xuezhou, Chairman of the Changchun Branch of the Jiusan Society, and others also spoke at the meeting. They all unanimously expressed their firm support for the anti-American armed demonstrations by our Fujian Front troops in shelling the "plague god." Workers, students, and members of urban people's communes from Changchun No. 1 Automobile Manufacturing Plant, Changchun Locomotive Plant, Jilin University of Technology, Jilin Normal University, and Quan'an People's Commune in Nanguan District of Changchun City have all held rallies in recent days.

People's organizations in Jilin Province have also issued written statements.

Responsible persons of various people's organizations and people from all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have issued statements, resolutely supporting the anti-American armed demonstrations by the People's Liberation Army's Fujian Front troops in shelling Jinmen (Quemoy). Jiang Yi, Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Federation of Trade Unions, representing more than one million workers and staff of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region, firmly supported the anti-American armed demonstrations by the People's Liberation Army's Fujian Front troops. He emphasized that Eisenhower's bandit trip has made the broad masses of our people further see that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the people of Asia and the world, and has also more thoroughly exposed the ugly face of U.S. imperialism's "fake peace, real war preparations." Alatan Aoqi'er (Mongolian), Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Youth League, pointed out that the people are not to be insulted. U.S. imperialism has done all kinds of bad things, and it will surely be burned to ashes in the increasingly strong anti-American fire of the people of Asia and the world. Chen Jieping, Deputy Director of the Women's Federation of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, said that the people of Asia have awakened, and the days when U.S. imperialism ran rampant in Asia are gone forever. E'nenritu (Daur), Deputy Director of the Counselor's Office of the People's Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, said that the Daur people, together with the people of all ethnic groups in the country, firmly support and support the just action of anti-American armed demonstrations.

At the meeting held by responsible persons of various democratic parties and people's organizations in Hunan Province and Changsha City, Tang Shengzhi, Vice Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the CPPCC, said: China is a strong country, and the Chinese people cannot be deceived. Taiwan is Chinese territory, and we must liberate Taiwan and thoroughly settle the heavy crimes of U.S. imperialism in Taiwan. He hoped that Kuomintang military and political personnel and compatriots in Taiwan, under the banner of patriotism, would unite with the people of the motherland and the people of the world to resolutely oppose the creation of "two Chinas" and overthrow U.S. imperialism. Yuan Xuezhi, Vice Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, said that our army's shelling of Jinmen and holding anti-American armed demonstrations fully expressed the firm will of the Chinese workers and the people of the whole country to oppose U.S. imperialism. He passionately stated: In order to severely crack down on the aggressive acts of U.S. imperialism, our entire staff guarantees to work harder and redouble our efforts to strengthen the power of our country and give the aggressors a devastating blow.

At the symposium jointly held by the CPPCC Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Committee, various democratic parties, people's organizations, and the CPPCC Yinchuan City Committee, Li Jinglin, Chairman of the CPPCC Autonomous Region Committee, said that the imperialist system is the root cause of war. In order to defend peace, we must be vigilant and resolutely fight U.S. imperialism to the end. Yuan Jinzhang, Chairman of the RCCK Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Committee, representing all members of the RCCK, resolutely supported the anti-American armed demonstrations by the Fujian Front troops. He said: The armed demonstrations by the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian Front fully expressed the firm will of the 650 million people of our country, and expressed the contempt and disdain of our people for Eisenhower. Responsible persons of various democratic parties, people's organizations, and the Islamic Association also spoke at the meeting.

Responsible persons of local organizations of various democratic parties and people's organizations in Yunnan Province, as well as upper-class figures of various ethnic minorities, held a meeting in Kunming. Zhang Tianfang, Chairman of the RCCK Yunnan Provincial Committee, said at the meeting: U.S. imperialism has done all kinds of bad things, and its days are numbered. He said that the Chinese people will never allow U.S. imperialism to occupy our territory of Taiwan for a long time. He hoped that the military and political personnel in Taiwan would recognize the future, inspire great righteousness, unite, and wage a resolute struggle against the American aggressors. Wang Jiesan, Vice Chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, said that U.S. imperialism has been occupying our sacred territory of Taiwan, barbarously trampling on our compatriots in Taiwan, and turning the beautiful island into a hell on earth. These heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism will be settled one day. We must liberate Taiwan, and we will never give up until we achieve our goal. Upper-class figures of various ethnic minorities who attended the meeting also expressed great anger at Eisenhower's bandit trip.
