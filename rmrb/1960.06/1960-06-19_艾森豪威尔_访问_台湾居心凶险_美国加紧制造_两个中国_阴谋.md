Xinhua News Agency, 18th: To coincide with Eisenhower's "visit" to Taiwan, the United States is instigating a group of pro-American elements to intensify their conspiracy to create "Two Chinas." An Agence France-Presse dispatch from Taipei on the 17th revealed that "on the eve of Eisenhower's arrival here, (on the 17th) many anti-government (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek clique) slogans appeared in several places in Taipei."

An Associated Press dispatch on the 18th stated that Liao Wenyi, an American running dog, gave Eisenhower an open letter, "urging" him to "advocate immediate United Nations supervision" of Taiwan and to declare that the United States opposes "supporting the Chiang government, one of the most notorious regimes in Asia." In addition, according to Taipei sources, pro-American elements in Taiwan have proposed to the Kuomintang authorities: "The Kuomintang must withdraw from the military, police, schools, and judicial organs. In addition, railway party branches, highway party branches, and industrial party branches must all be abolished." At the same time, they advocate that American "interference in Taiwan's internal affairs" is a matter of course, demanding that the United States take a tough stance against Chiang Kai-shek to achieve "Taiwan autonomy," realizing the long-term dream of American imperialism of "Two Chinas" and placing China's territory of Taiwan permanently under American occupation.

    艾森豪威尔“访问”台湾居心凶险
    美国加紧制造“两个中国”阴谋
    新华社18日讯　配合艾森豪威尔“访问”台湾，美国正策动一批亲美分子，加紧制造“两个中国”的阴谋活动。法新社17日从台北发出的消息透露，“在艾森豪威尔到达这里的前夕，（17日）在台北市几个地方出现许多反政府（指蒋介石集团）的标语”。
    美联社18日的消息说，美国走狗廖文毅给艾森豪威尔一封公开信，“吁请”他“倡导立即由联合国监督”台湾，宣布美国反对“支持亚洲臭名远扬的政权之一的蒋政府”。另外，据台北消息说，在台湾的亲美分子向国民党当局提出：“国民党须退出军队、警察和学校与司法机关。此外，铁路党部、公路党部和产业党部等一律撤销”。同时鼓吹美国“干涉台湾内政”是理所当然的，要求美国对蒋介石采取强硬态度，使“台湾自治”，实现美帝国主义长期梦想的“两个中国”，把中国领土台湾永远置于美国占领下。
