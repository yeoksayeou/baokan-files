Xinhua News Agency, June 28th, Tokyo Dispatch: The National Council to Prevent Revision of the "Security Treaty" held its sixth national convention in Tokyo today. One hundred and thirty-eight representatives from prefectural-level joint struggle organizations passed a resolution at the meeting, calling on the Japanese people to rise up and crush the new "Security Treaty" and protest against the Nobusuke Kishi government's suppression of mass movements.

In his general report, Kozo Minakuchi, Secretary-General of the National Council, pointed out that the Japanese people had made a great contribution to the cause of peace and anti-imperialism by forcing Nobusuke Kishi to announce his resignation, preventing Eisenhower's visit to Japan, and declaring the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" invalid.

He said that the movement against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty has made many people deeply aware of their own strength.

Minakuchi emphasized the need to more forcefully launch the movement against the new "Security Treaty" in rural areas.

The National Council Secretariat submitted to the conference a draft proposal for strengthening the crushing of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. The draft stipulates: On July 2, the 20th National Unified Action Day, a national rally will be held throughout Japan with the theme of "Rejecting the New Security Treaty, Demanding the Immediate Dissolution of the Diet, and Crushing Illegal Suppression"; from mid-July, activities against the new "Security Treaty," such as lectures and symposiums, will be held centering on rural areas; a nationwide signature campaign will be launched through door-to-door visits and street signatures; and movements demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops, opposing U.S. military bases, and demanding the withdrawal of U-2 spy planes will be strengthened.

Representatives from various regions spoke at the meeting one after another, emphasizing that the movement against the new "Security Treaty" was not over, and that the National Council should take "Abolish the 'Security Treaty'" as its slogan, and turn the current National Council into a permanent organization. Their reason is that more and more people realize that the enemies of the Japanese people are not only Nobusuke Kishi, but also the U.S. imperialists.

Many representatives emphasized that it is necessary to concentrate firepower to strongly oppose the organization of a disguised Nobusuke Kishi cabinet. They said that the people should continue to maintain their decisive role in policy direction, as they have played in the massive movement.

Many representatives also argued that the current political goal should be to organize a caretaker government with the Socialist Party and the Communist Party as the core. They believe that the two parties have strengthened their unified action, which has never happened before the start of the struggle against the "Security Treaty."

After heated discussions, the conference decided that the National Council Secretariat would include some of the opinions raised by the representatives in the new policy and officially announce it soon.

Xinhua News Agency, June 28th, Tokyo Dispatch: Leaders from all walks of life in Japan today issued statements to reporters, criticizing Nobusuke Kishi for delaying his resignation and delaying the dissolution of the Diet after announcing his "determination to resign," attempting to buy time to organize a second Nobusuke Kishi-type cabinet.

Ichizo Suzuki, a member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, emphasized that the current task of the Japanese people is to establish an anti-Kishi united front, force the Kishi cabinet to resign immediately, dissolve the Diet, hold general elections, and prevent the emergence of a "second Nobusuke Kishi cabinet."

He said that the Japanese people's anti-U.S. and anti-Kishi patriotic struggle for more than a year has moved the movement to abolish the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" forward a step, and the Japanese people will never allow the Japanese and U.S. reactionaries to re-establish a cabinet like the Nobusuke Kishi group that strengthens the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty system.

Yoshio Yanagimoto, Political Affairs Director of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), pointed out that the Nobusuke Kishi group is trying to cover up its political failure, delaying the date of the Diet's dissolution, attempting to suppress patriots who participated in the anti-U.S. struggle, and mobilizing propaganda organs to create public opinion favorable to them, in order to reorganize a cabinet that faithfully implements the policies of U.S. imperialism and Japanese traitorous monopoly capital.

He said that the politically awakened Japanese people will never allow this conspiracy to succeed, and the Nobusuke Kishi group's conspiracy is doomed to fail.

Yanagimoto stated that Japanese workers will fight to the end to force the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet to step down immediately, dissolve the Diet, and prevent the emergence of a "second Nobusuke Kishi cabinet."

Tadashi Yaoita, head of the National Federation of Farmers' Associations, said that Nobusuke Kishi has no right to interfere in the issue of the next cabinet. Japanese farmers oppose the private transfer of power and demand his immediate resignation.

Teizaburo Kono, Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce and Industry Organizations, pointed out that the Nobusuke Kishi group should bear all the responsibility for the current political situation, and the Kishi cabinet must resign immediately and dissolve the Diet.

Kenzo Nakajima, a famous figure in Japanese cultural circles, said that the Japanese people will not allow the likes of Nobusuke Kishi to privately transfer power. He demanded that the Kishi cabinet step down immediately and dissolve the Diet.

Toshiyoshi Miyazawa, a famous Japanese jurist, published an article in today's "Asahi Shimbun" expressing support for the proposal to first organize a joint caretaker cabinet of various parties to dissolve the Diet and hold general elections, and then decide on the next prime minister based on the results of the general elections.

Miyazawa pointed out that Nobusuke Kishi said in his recent resignation statement that the next cabinet must "implement the Security Treaty and establish public order." This statement is alarming and reminiscent of the past methods used by fascists who used the excuse of curbing "violence" to restrict various freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution.

Xinhua News Agency, June 28th, Tokyo Dispatch: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) held a meeting in Tokyo this afternoon and decided to launch a resolute struggle against the Nobusuke Kishi government's illegal suppression of workers.

According to the decision, if the Nobusuke Kishi government announces sanctions against workers, the member unions of this powerful union, which has 3.6 million members, will immediately hold a 30-minute workplace protest rally the next day.

"Sohyo" also decided to hold protest demonstrations and large-scale rallies on June 30, July 1, and July 2, the three days when it is expected that sanctions may be announced, to oppose the government's conspiracy to suppress workers.

"Sohyo" also decided to hold a national convention in Tokyo from August 2 to 6. The first day of this regular convention will be the "Sohyo" 10th anniversary ceremony.

Xinhua News Agency, June 28th, Tokyo Dispatch: The Japan National Railway Motive Power Union decided at its national convention on the 27th to join the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) in order to strengthen the unity of the Japanese labor front.

Most of the representatives pointed out at the meeting that if they do not cooperate with the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, they will not be able to strongly launch a struggle against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and the capitalists' "enterprise rationalization" policies in the future.

The Japan National Railway Motive Power Union is composed of more than 53,000 train drivers. In the four general strikes held recently, it served as the main force together with the National Railway Workers' Union of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan.

    日本人民不许第二个岸信介内阁上台
    各界领袖纷纷发表谈话强烈谴责岸信介集团的政治阴谋
    “国民会议”全国代表大会号召人民奋起粉碎日美条约
    新华社28日讯　东京消息：阻止修改“安全条约”国民会议今天在东京举行第六次全国代表大会。一百三十八位县一级的地方共同斗争组织代表在会上通过决议，号召日本人民奋起粉碎新“安全条约”和抗议岸信介政府镇压群众运动。
    国民会议事务局长水口宏三在总报告中指出，由于日本人民迫使岸信介宣布辞职、阻止艾森豪威尔访日和宣布新日美“安全条约”无效，他们对于和平和反对帝国主义的事业作出了巨大的贡献。
    他说，反对日美军事同盟条约的运动，使许多群众深深认识到自己的力量。
    水口着重指出需要在农村地区更加有力地展开反对新“安全条约”的运动。
    国民会议事务局向大会提出了加强粉碎日美军事同盟条约的方针草案。草案规定：在第二十次全国统一行动的7月2日，将在日本全国举行“不承认新安全条约、要求立即解散国会、粉碎非法镇压”大会；从7月中旬起，将以农村为中心举办演讲会、座谈会等反对新“安全条约”的活动；通过挨户访问和街头征集签名的方式展开全国性签名运动；加强要求美军撤走、反对美军基地以及要求撤走U—2型间谍飞机等运动。
    各地代表相继在会上发言，他们强调指出反对新“安全条约”运动并没有过去，国民会议应该以“废除‘安全条约’”作为它的口号，并且把目前的国民会议变成常设机构。他们的理由是：越来越多的人认识到：日本人民的敌人不仅是岸信介，还有美帝国主义者。
    许多代表强调必须集中火力强烈反对组织变相的岸信介内阁。他们说，人民应该在政策方针方面继续保持自己的决定性作用，他们在声势浩大的运动中起了这种作用。
    还有许多代表主张，当前的政治目标应当是组织以社会党和共产党为核心的看守政府。他们认为这两个政党加强了统一行动，这是在开始反对“安全条约”斗争以前从来没有过的。
    经过热烈的讨论，会议决定国民会议干事会将把代表们提出的一些意见列入新的方针中，并且在不久以后正式公布。
    新华社28日讯　东京消息：日本各界领袖今天向新闻记者发表谈话，抨击岸信介在宣布“决心辞职”后又拖延下台和拖延解散国会，企图争取时间来组织第二个岸信介类型的内阁的阴谋。
    日本共产党中央委员会干部会委员铃木市藏强调指出，日本人民目前的课题是建立反岸联合战线，迫使岸内阁立即辞职，解散国会，举行大选，阻止出现“第二个岸信介内阁”。
    他说，一年多以来日本人民的反美反岸爱国斗争已经使废除新日美“安全条约”的运动向前迈进了一步，日本人民绝不容许日美反动派再次建立像岸信介集团那样加强日美军事同盟条约体系的内阁。
    日本工会总评议会政治部长柳本美雄指出，岸信介集团企图遮掩它在政治上的失败，正在拖延解散国会的日期，企图对参加反美斗争的爱国者进行镇压，并且动员宣传机关制造有利于它们的舆论，以便于再次组织忠实执行美帝国主义和日本卖国垄断资本的政策的内阁。
    他说，已经提高了政治觉悟的日本人民，绝不让这种阴谋得逞，岸信介集团的阴谋注定要失败。
    柳本表示，日本工人将为迫使岸信介内阁立即下台、解散国会、阻止出现“第二个岸信介内阁”而斗争到底。
    全日本农民协会联合会负责人八百板正说，岸信介无权插嘴下届内阁的问题。日本农民反对政权的私相授受，要求他立即辞职。
    全国商工团体联合会会长河野贞三郎指出，目前政局的一切责任应由岸信介集团承担，岸内阁必须立即辞职和解散国会。
    日本文化界著名人士中岛健藏说，日本人民不许岸信介之流私相授受政权。他要求岸内阁立即下台和解散国会。
    日本著名法学家宫泽俊义在今天的“朝日新闻”上发表文章，表示支持先组织各党联合看守内阁来解散国会和举行大选，然后根据大选结果来决定下任首相人选的主张。
    宫泽指出，岸信介在不久前发表的辞职声明中曾经说：下届内阁必须“执行安全条约和确立治安”，这句话令人提高警惕，并且忆起以制止“暴力”为借口限制为宪法所保障的各种自由的法西斯之徒过去惯用的手法。
    新华社28日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会今天下午在东京举行会议，决定展开坚决的斗争，反对岸信介政府非法镇压工人。
    根据决定，如果岸信介政府宣布处分工人，拥有三百六十万会员的这个强大工会的各个成员工会将立刻在第二天举行三十分钟的工作场所抗议大会。
    “总评”还决定在预料可能宣布处分的6月30日、7月1日、2日三天举行抗议示威和大规模的集会，反对政府镇压工人的阴谋。
    “总评”并且决定将从8月2日到6日在东京举行全国代表大会。这次定期大会的第一天将举行“总评”成立十周年纪念仪式。
    新华社28日讯 　东京消息：日本国营机车工会27日在全国代表大会上决定加入日本工会总评议会，以加强日本劳工战线的统一。
    大多数的代表在会上指出，如果不同日本工会总评议会合作，今后不能强有力地展开反对新日美
  “安全条约”和资本家的“企业合理化”政策的斗争。
    日本国营机车工会是由五万三千多名火车司机组成的。它在最近举行的四次总罢工中，同日本工会总评议会的国营铁道工会一起，担任了主力军。
