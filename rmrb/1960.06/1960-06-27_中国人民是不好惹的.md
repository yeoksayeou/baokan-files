　　The Chinese People Are Not to Be Trifled With
　　National Militia Hero Yu Huahhu
　　The American robbers have occupied our territory of Taiwan for a full ten years. For ten years, this gang of murderous and arsonous jackals has been riding roughshod over the people of Taiwan, carrying out cruel oppression against our Taiwan compatriots. The robbers have also established various military bases in Taiwan. To this day, American imperialism still refuses to leave Taiwan, where it is stepping up its war preparations. Sooner or later, we will make American imperialism pay all the blood debts it owes the Chinese people.
　　On the eve of the tenth anniversary of American imperialism's occupation of our territory Taiwan, the dog thief Eisenhower dared to sneak onto our territory of Taiwan. A bowl of clear water shows the bottom; the robber's trip is ill-intentioned, bringing with it a whiff of gunpowder, plotting a new war in Taiwan, and also trying to create a "two Chinas" conspiracy,妄想想永远霸占台湾妄图 to permanently occupy Taiwan. When I heard the news of the anti-American armed demonstration on the Fujian front, I was overjoyed. Our People's Liberation Army's artillery fired well, fired wonderfully, with ten thousand cannons firing in unison. Each shell carried the anger of the people of the whole country, to "welcome" and "send off" the "plague god" Eisenhower. This fully demonstrates the great Chinese people's contempt and scorn for American imperialism.
　　We Chinese people have always despised and scorned imperialism. Fifteen years ago, the militia of our Wenyuanhou Village defeated the invading Japanese devils with a minefield. Today, the strength of the Chinese people is many times greater than it was during the Anti-Japanese War. Since the implementation of the policy of "the whole nation as soldiers," our militia forces have been full of energy and enthusiasm, not only playing a shock force role on the production front, but also learning a set of skills to defend the motherland, and are always ready to strike at any enemy who dares to invade our country. Now that I am the militia battalion commander, I want to educate the entire battalion of militiamen to always listen to the Party's words, maintain a high degree of vigilance at all times, and defend the motherland's coast. On behalf of the entire battalion of militiamen, I swear to the motherland: Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan. If American imperialism dares to launch a war of aggression, our militia forces will cooperate with the main forces to wipe it out like we wiped out the Japanese bandits, so that it will have a way in but no way out, let it taste the power of the Chinese people, and let it know that the great Chinese people are not to be trifled with.

　  中国人民是不好惹的
    全国民兵英雄　于化虎
    美国强盗侵占我国领土台湾，已经整整十年了。十年来，这群杀人放火的豺狼，一直骑在台湾人民头上作威作福，对台湾同胞进行了残酷的压迫。强盗们还在台湾建立各种军事基地，直到今天，美帝国主义还仍然赖在台湾不走，在那里加紧进行着备战活动。美帝国主义欠下中国人民的这些血债，总有一天我们要叫它全部偿还的。
    在美帝国主义侵占我国领土台湾十周年前夕，艾森豪威尔这个狗贼竟敢偷偷地爬上我国的领土台湾。一碗清水看到底，强盗旅行不怀好意，带来一身火药味，到台湾策划新战争，并且还想搞“两个中国”的阴谋，妄图永远霸占台湾。当我听到福建前线举行反美武装大示威的消息，高兴万分。俺人民解放军的大炮打得好，打得妙，万炮齐轰，每发炮弹都带着全国人民的愤怒，去“迎”“送”艾森豪威尔这个“瘟神”，这充分表示了伟大中国人民对美帝国主义的蔑视和鄙视。
    对于帝国主义，我们中国人民从来都是加以蔑视和鄙视的。十五年前，俺文元后村的民兵用地雷阵打败了前来进攻的日本鬼子。今天，中国人民的力量比起抗日战争时期来不知要大多少倍了。我们的民兵队伍，自从实行全民皆兵后，个个精神抖擞，干劲冲天，不仅在生产战线上发挥了突击队的作用，而且学会了一套保卫祖国的本领，时刻都准备着打击胆敢侵犯我国的敌人。现在我担任民兵营长，我要教育全营民兵永远听党的话，时刻保持高度的警惕，保卫着祖国的海防。我代表全营民兵向祖国宣誓：台湾是中国的领土，中国人民一定要解放台湾。假若美帝国主义胆敢发动侵略战争，我们民兵部队将配合主力部队像消灭日本强盗那样，叫它有来路，无去路，叫它尝尝中国人民的厉害，叫它知道伟大的中国人民是不好惹的。
