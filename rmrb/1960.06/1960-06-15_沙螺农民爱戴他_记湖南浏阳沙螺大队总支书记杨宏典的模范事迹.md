    Sha Luo Peasants Love Him
    —An Account of the Model Deeds of Yang Hongdian, Party Branch Secretary of the Sha Luo Brigade in Liuyang, Hunan
    By Xinhua News Agency Reporter Huang Ye
    Rural cadres in Hunan Province all know that there is a model cadre in Liuyang County named Yang Hongdian. This is because last summer, rural cadres throughout the province studied Yang Hongdian's model deeds of working hard and in-depth, and adhering to the mass line. A year has passed, how is Yang Hongdian's work situation? Not long ago, I visited the Sha Luo Brigade of the Da Yao People's Commune in Liuyang County, where Yang Hongdian serves as the Party Branch Secretary.
    When I arrived at the Sha Luo Brigade, it was morning, and Yang Hongdian had already gone to inspect production nearby. After a while, he came back from outside, gave a few words to the secretary, and then turned around to inspect production again. He was barefoot, carrying a manure basket in his hand. While inspecting production, he also picked up the manure on the side of the road and put it in the basket. Regardless of wind or rain, he always picks up twenty or thirty catties to fifty or sixty catties of manure every day. Yang Hongdian said, "This way, I inspect production, improve sanitation, and accumulate fertilizer."
    For an entire morning, I followed Yang Hongdian and looked at all the rice seedling fields, which account for 60% of the entire brigade. Every time he went to a place, he would find the seedling protectors, operation team leaders, and production team cadres to discuss and urge everyone to water, add water, and change water for the rice seedling fields in a timely manner. If he found any problems, he would take out his notebook from his pocket and write them down, preparing to discuss them with the branch committee members when he returned.
    The impression Yang Hongdian gave me that day was that he was a person who could not sit still. But the commune members told me: Secretary Yang's model deeds are numerous!
    The Days and Nights of Protecting Seedlings
    This year, the Sha Luo Brigade began to soak rice seeds and cultivate seedlings for early rice on March 10. During those days of ditching, germinating, planting in mud, and protecting seedlings, Yang Hongdian guarded the seed buckets and seedling fields day and night. He always held that thermometer in his hand, constantly paying attention to the temperature changes in the seed grains and seedling fields.
    On March 15th, Yang Hongdian went to the Dan Gui Brigade, more than ten miles away from Sha Luo, to attend a meeting. The meeting lasted until twelve o'clock at night. Outside the house, the north wind was howling, and it was raining heavily. He pulled out the thermometer and saw that the temperature was only eight degrees. He was very anxious because in such weather, the seed grains that had been planted in the mud had to be protected from the cold, and those that had not been planted in the mud were afraid of being burned in the bucket. As soon as the meeting was over, he put on a bamboo hat and a raincoat and ran back in the wind and rain.
    As soon as Yang Hongdian arrived at the place where the seeds were placed at the foot of the mountain production team, he hurriedly inserted the thermometer into the seed buckets and checked them one by one. He found that the temperature of six of the fourteen buckets of seeds in this team was abnormal, and had risen to thirty-eight degrees. It was necessary to quickly find a way to lower the temperature. So he called up the branch secretary of this production team, Li Jianke, the propaganda and education member of the brigade party branch, Li Hewan, and the seedling protectors Li Qianru and Li Shi, and worked with them to loosen the seed grains and watered them again. Yang Hongdian saw that the temperature had dropped to thirty degrees before he put on his raincoat and went to check other teams. That night, Yang Hongdian carefully checked every rice seedling field and every bucket of seed grain in the entire brigade. When he arrived at the Sha Luo production team, it was already five o'clock in the morning.
    Caring for the Lives of the Masses
    While leading production, Yang Hongdian also cared very much about the lives of the commune members, actively trying to help the masses solve difficulties, and became a confidant of the masses.
    One day, Yang Hongdian went to the Shi Chong production team to inspect production and heard two children crying in a house by the road. Yang Hongdian paid attention to such a common thing. He walked in and found that the legs of the children of martyr Liu Yixing were suffering from a malignant disease, red and swollen, which is locally called a tumor disease. The children were crying in pain, and Liu Yixing was frowning beside them. From the conversation, Yang Hongdian learned that Liu Yixing was embarrassed to borrow money from the brigade to treat his children's illness. He was deeply moved by Liu Yixing's action of not asking the commune for help even when he had difficulties. After returning to the brigade headquarters, he asked the accountant to immediately send some money to Liu Yixing.
    Yang Hongdian often goes to various canteens to inspect work, patiently studying with the cooks and administrators how to run the canteens well. If the commune members have any opinions about the canteen, he always urges the canteen staff to answer them one by one. If it can be done, he immediately does it; if it cannot be done temporarily, he also explains the reasons to the commune members. When he sees that the canteen cooks are too busy, he helps with carrying water, washing vegetables, and cooking..., doing whatever he sees.
    Yang Hongdian's meticulous care for the lives of the masses has been deeply loved by the commune members. When picking tea seeds last year, the commune members of Feng Shan Ling heard that Yang Hongdian was going to go up the mountain with everyone, and they had already cleaned up a neat house for him, with thick straw垫ed on the bed. Commune members Chen Lanzhen and Li Tongqing both scrambled to spread their quilts on the bed. Everyone said: Secretary Yang works hard for us all day long and has not slept well for a night under the mountain. This time, he must be allowed to rest well for a few nights. The masses cared for him so much that he felt that he should work more for everyone. During the days of picking tea seeds on the mountain, he worked day and night with the commune members, never willing to rest for a minute.
      The Sha Luo Brigade Catches Up with the Rich Brigade
    The peasants of Sha Luo suffered cruel exploitation by landlords in the old society. Coupled with severe natural disasters, life was very poor. After liberation, the agricultural cooperatives still did not have the strength to resist the attacks of severe natural disasters, so the standard of living was lower than that of nearby agricultural cooperatives.
    However, after the establishment of the commune, the poor appearance of the Sha Luo Brigade changed in just one year. When the year-end settlement was made last year, the commune members were all smiles. In that year, the deposits of the commune members of the entire brigade in the credit cooperative increased from only more than 300 yuan in March last year to more than 32,000 yuan in the same period this year. Last year, the public accumulation of the brigade expanded to more than 22,350 yuan, an increase of 38% compared to 1958. The brigade built new pumping stations, oil pressing mills, sugar factories, wineries, and pig farms, bought rice milling machines, and added more than 300 oxcarts and flatbed carts... Last year, the Sha Luo Brigade had already caught up with the rich brigade.
    During the days of catching up with the rich brigade, the Sha Luo Brigade continuously encountered more than 110 days of severe drought and three serious insect plagues. Yang Hongdian led the commune members to water and fight drought day and night, using local medicines to control insects. At night, he discussed methods with cadres and experienced farmers. When he was tired, he would rest briefly in the shade of a tree by the field or in a drought-resistant shed. The masses were very moved.

    沙螺农民爱戴他
    ——记湖南浏阳沙螺大队总支书记杨宏典的模范事迹
    新华社记者　黄叶
    湖南省的农村干部，都知道浏阳县有个模范干部叫杨宏典。因为去年夏季，全省农村干部都学习过杨宏典艰苦深入、坚持群众路线的模范事迹。一年过去了，杨宏典的工作情况怎样？不久前记者到杨宏典担任党总支书记的浏阳县大瑶人民公社沙螺大队作了一次访问。
    记者到沙螺大队的时候，正是早晨，杨宏典已经到附近检查生产去了。不一会，他从外面回来，向秘书交代了几句话，又转身检查生产去了。他赤着脚，手上提着粪箕，边检查生产，顺便把路边上的粪便拣到粪箕里。不管刮风下雨，他每天总要拣上二、三十斤到五、六十斤粪。杨宏典说：“这样，检查了生产，还搞了卫生，积了肥。”
    整整一个上午，我跟着杨宏典把占全大队60％的秧田都看了一遍。每到一个地方，他就把那里的护秧员、作业组长和生产队的干部找到一起研究，督促大家给秧田及时放水、加水、换水，发现什么问题，他就从口袋里掏出笔记本记了下来，准备回去和总支委员们研究。
    这一天杨宏典给我的印象是，他是一个闲不住的人。但是社员们告诉我：杨书记的模范事迹还多着哩！
    护秧的日日夜夜
    今年，沙螺大队在3月10日就开始进行早稻浸种育秧了。在渠种、催芽、下泥、护秧的那些日子里，杨宏典日日夜夜守护在种谷桶和秧田边上。他手里总是拿着那支温度计，时时刻刻注意着种谷和秧田里的温度变化。
    3月15日那天，杨宏典到离沙螺十来里地的丹桂大队去开会，会开到深夜十二点，房子外面北风刮得呜呜叫，雨下得很急。他抽出温度计一看，气温只有八度。他心里非常着急，因为碰到这样的天气，下了泥的种谷要防寒，没下泥的怕烧坏桶。一开完会，他就戴上斗笠，披起蓑衣，冒着风雨往回跑。
    杨宏典一到山下生产队放种谷的地方，就急忙把温度计插进种谷桶里，一桶一桶地检查。他发现这个队十四桶种谷里有六桶的温度不正常，已经上升到三十八度了，必须赶快设法降低温度。于是他把这个生产队的分支书记李兼克、大队总支宣教委员李和万和护秧员李谦如、李仕全都叫了起来，同他们一起动手把种谷耙松，又浇了一遍水。杨宏典看看温度已经下降到三十度了，才披上蓑衣到别的队去检查。这一晚上，杨宏典把全大队每一块秧田和每一桶种谷都仔细检查了一遍。当他到沙螺生产队的时候，已经是清晨五点钟了。
    关心群众生活
    杨宏典在领导生产的同时，也非常关心社员的生活，积极设法帮助群众解决困难，成为群众的知心人。
    有一天，杨宏典到石冲生产队去检查生产，听到路边屋子里有两个小孩在哭。这样一件极平常的事，杨宏典也非常注意。他走进去一看，发现是烈属刘宜兴的小孩腿上生了一种恶疾，又红又肿，这里俗话叫瘤疾病。小孩痛得直哭，刘宜兴在旁边愁眉不展。从谈话中，杨宏典知道刘宜兴不好意思向大队借钱给孩子治病，他被刘宜兴这种有困难也不向社里开口的行动深深感动，回到大队部以后，要会计立即给刘宜兴送去了一些钱。
    杨宏典经常到各个食堂去检查工作，耐心地同炊事员、事务员们一起研究怎样把食堂办好。社员对食堂有什么意见，他总是督促食堂工作人员逐项答复，能办的就马上照办，暂时不能办到的也向社员说清道理。当他看到食堂炊事员忙不过来的时候，他就帮着挑水、洗菜、做饭……，看到什么就做什么。
    杨宏典这样无微不至的关心群众的生活，受到社员们的深深爱戴。去年摘茶子的时候，凤山岭的社员听说杨宏典要同大家一起上山，老早就给他收拾了一间齐整的房子，在床上垫了厚厚的稻草，社员陈兰珍和李同庆都抢着把自己的被子铺在床上。大家都说：杨书记一天到晚为我们辛辛苦苦，在山下没有睡过一晚好觉，这一回一定得让他好好休息几晚。群众这样关心他，他更觉得自己应该多为大家工作，在山上摘茶子的日子里，他一样的日日夜夜跟社员们一起劳动，从来也不愿意多休息一分钟。
      沙螺大队赶上了富队
    沙螺的农民，在旧社会遭受地主的残酷剥削，加上严重的自然灾害，生活非常贫困，解放以后，农业社仍然没有力量抵制住严重的自然灾害的袭击，因此生活水平比附近的农业社都要低些。
    可是成立公社以后，仅仅一年光景，沙螺大队的穷困面貌就得到改变了。去年年终结算的时候，社员们个个喜笑颜开。在这一年里，全大队社员在信用部的存款，去年3月只三百多元，今年同期已经增加到三万二千多元。去年大队的公共积累扩大到二万二千三百五十多元，比1958年增加了38％。大队新建了抽水机站、油榨房、糖厂、酒厂、猪场，买了打米机，添制了三百多部牛车、板车……。去年沙螺大队就已经赶上了富队。
    在赶富队的日子里，沙螺大队连续遭遇了一百一十多天大旱和三次严重的虫灾，杨宏典夜以继日地领导社员车水抗旱，用土药治虫，夜晚又同干部、老农研究办法，累了就在田边树荫下或抗旱棚里稍为休息一下，群众非常感动。
