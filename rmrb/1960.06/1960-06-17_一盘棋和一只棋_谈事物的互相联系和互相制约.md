    A Chess Game and a Single Piece
    — On the Interrelation and Mutual Restriction of Things
    Yuè Shàngwǔ, Fengtai Locomotive Depot, Former Driver of the Mao Zedong Locomotive

    A chess game is composed of many pieces, and each piece is interconnected and influences each other. When playing chess, we often use the "cannon behind the horse" to defeat the opponent. At this time, the horse and the cannon must cooperate and act in coordination, otherwise, they cannot win. We often say, "One wrong move loses the game," which means that in a chess game, if one piece does not cooperate well, it will affect the overall victory.

    Our work is similar to playing chess, and various tasks are also interconnected and affect each other. Take the relationship between the transportation workshop and the factory workshop in our depot as an example. The quality of the locomotives is a key aspect of our depot's work, and the quality of the locomotives is closely related to the quality of work in each workshop throughout the depot. If only the factory overhauls well, but the crew does not maintain it well during use, then the quality of the locomotive will still not improve. Conversely, if only the crew maintains it well, but the factory does not overhaul it well, then the quality of the locomotive will still not improve. This shows that to do a good job in a certain task, it is not enough to rely solely on one department in isolation, but rather requires close cooperation between various departments.

    To give another example, on our railways, the locomotive department, rolling stock department, engineering department, electricity department, and inspection department are also interconnected and influence each other. Like the composition of a train dragon, it requires the good cooperation of the locomotive, rolling stock, engineering, electricity, and inspection departments. The dispatcher must do a good job as the dragon's waist, the locomotive department must do a good job as the dragon's head, the rolling stock department must do a good job as the dragon's body, the engineering department must do a good job as the dragon's path, the electricity department must do a good job as the dragon's eyes and ears, and the inspection department must protect the dragon well. Only when each department cooperates well can a dragon be formed. If one department does not cooperate well, it will cause the phenomenon of "trapped dragon" or "killing the dragon," affecting transportation order and the country's transportation tasks. It can be seen that the various departments of transportation are not only interconnected but also influence each other.

    The interrelation and mutual influence of objective things are not exactly the same, and there are also primary and secondary distinctions. In terms of the locomotive department, rolling stock department, engineering department, electricity department, and inspection department, the locomotive department is connected with the rolling stock department, engineering department, electricity department, and inspection department. The rolling stock department is also connected with the engineering department, electricity department, and inspection department. The engineering department is connected with the electricity department and the inspection department. The electricity department is connected with the inspection department. In short, the locomotive, rolling stock, engineering, electricity, and inspection departments are all interconnected. Among these many connections, which connection is the primary one? From the perspective of how to complete the country's transportation tasks more, faster, better, and more economically, and from the perspective of how to solve the main contradiction between transport volume and transport capacity under the existing transportation conditions, the connection between the station's quick loading and unloading and the locomotive's more and faster running is the primary one. Of course, this is not to say that the connection between the locomotive, engineering, electricity, and inspection departments, or the rolling stock, engineering, electricity, and inspection departments is unimportant, but rather that under the normal circumstances of the locomotive, rolling stock, engineering, electricity, and inspection departments cooperating with each other, in order to complete or overfulfill the country's transportation tasks, we must first grasp the connection between transport volume and transport capacity of locomotive and rolling stock which becomes the main contradiction. Because their connection is directly related to the amount of goods transported, while the connection between engineering, electricity, and inspection departments and the locomotive and rolling stock departments is to ensure the smooth progress of the work of the locomotive and rolling stock departments in all aspects. This distinction between primary and secondary interrelation is an objective existence of things themselves. If, in railway transportation, the connections between the locomotive, rolling stock, engineering, electricity, and inspection departments are treated equally, without focusing on the connection between quick loading and unloading and the locomotive's more and faster running, then the transportation task cannot be completed. This primary connection is the focus of work under normal transportation conditions.

    The above facts show that all things in the world are interconnected and influence each other, and there is no thing that exists alone without being related to other things. Therefore, when doing any work, we must have a "chess game" mentality. This "chess game" mentality is rooted in the philosophical principle of Chairman Mao, who said that "the movement of every thing is interconnected and influenced by other things around it."

    Then, will the "chess game" mentality affect the enthusiasm of each "chess piece"? Not at all. Because each piece cannot be separated from a chess game, and the task of each piece is consistent with the task of the chess game, which is to defeat the opponent. Our railway transportation work, like the work of other departments across the country, also plays the role of a single chess piece. When ensuring the ascent of the "Marshal Steel," we do everything we can to pave the way for the "Marshal Steel," and in terms of transportation order, we must consider which to transport first and which to transport later. The railway transportation department is a department of the state apparatus and must never deviate from the overall task of the state, transporting whatever it likes. Each unit, in order to do a good job in its own department, must also link its work with the overall task of the country. Like the advanced 304 and 1588 contract groups in our depot, when completing transportation tasks, they first considered the overall situation, linking the transportation tasks of the group with the entire transportation task, and linking individual work with the socialist construction cause, proactively going to various stations to find work. They proposed: "Hook up the locomotive if there is one, pull the cargo if there is any"; "Go wherever the dispatcher points." They also proposed: "Overload, but still run fast." Therefore, they not only overfulfilled the transportation tasks assigned to them by the state but also created many advanced experiences, driving the work of other contract groups. This is the result of their not deviating from the requirements of completing the overall task of the state, and giving full play to their enthusiasm and creativity. This proves that the "chess game" mentality will not affect the enthusiasm of a single "chess piece." On the contrary, only by first establishing a "chess game" mentality can we correctly recognize the position and role of a single "chess piece" in a chess game, and fully exert the enthusiasm and creativity of a single "chess piece."

    The relationship between a single "chess piece" and a "chess game" is not rigid either, and their positions can change under certain conditions. The whole country is a chess game, and each factory, mine, enterprise, or other department is a single chess piece. However, if we regard a factory as a chess game, then each workshop within this factory is a single chess piece. If we regard a workshop as a chess game, then each team within this workshop is a single chess piece. Therefore, each unit is both a single chess piece and a chess game. This means that we must look at problems from the interrelation and mutual influence of things, and not isolate ourselves, only seeing the role of our own unit as a single chess piece, and not seeing that it also has the significance of a chess game.

    In short, the "chess game" mentality is based on the principle of the interrelation and mutual influence of things, and it is the idea of communist large-scale collaboration. Whoever uses the viewpoint of interrelation and mutual influence to observe and handle problems will work well. Conversely, whoever only sees one point, cannot see the whole picture, and uses an isolated and one-sided viewpoint to observe and handle problems will not do a good job. Only by establishing a communist "chess game" mentality and overcoming the bourgeois ideology of departmentalism can we do a good job in our own units and complete the tasks assigned to us by the state.

### 一盘棋和一只棋——谈事物的互相联系和互相制约

    一盘棋和一只棋
    ——谈事物的互相联系和互相制约
    丰台机务段、原毛泽东号机车司机长　岳尚武
    一盘棋是由很多棋子组成的，各个棋子都是互相联系和互相影响的。在下象棋的时候，我们常用“马后炮”战胜对方。这时，马和炮一定要互相配合，协同动作，否则就不能取胜。我们常说，“棋走一步错”，这就是说在一盘棋里，有一个棋子配合得不好，都会影响全局的胜利。
    我们做工作也与下象棋相似，各种工作也是互相联系和互相影响的。就拿我们段的运输车间与工厂车间的关系来说吧，机车的质量是我段工作中的一个关键，而机车质量的好坏，又与全段各车间的工作好坏有密切的关系。如果只是工厂检修得好，而乘务员在使用时保养得不好，那末机车的质量仍提不高。反过来说，如果只有乘务员保养得好，而工厂检修得不好，那末机车的质量也仍提不高。这说明要想作好某一项工作，并不是孤立地单靠哪一个部门就行的，而是要有各个部门之间的密切配合。
    再举例来说，在我们铁路上，机、车、工、电、检之间也是互相联系、互相影响的。像一条列车龙的组成，就需要有机、车、工、电、检各个部门的很好地配合。调度员要作好龙腰，机务要作好龙头，车辆要作好龙身，工务要作好龙道，电务要作好龙眼龙耳，检车要把龙保护好。只有各个部门都配合得好，才能组成一条龙。如有一个部门配合得不好，那就会造成“困龙”、“杀龙”的现象，影响运输秩序，影响国家的运输任务。可见运输的各个部门之间不仅互相联系，而且互相影响。
    客观事物的互相联系和互相影响，不是完全一样的，还有主要和次要的区别。就机、车、工、电、检来说，机务与车务、工务、电务、检车之间有联系，车务与工务、电务、检车之间也有联系，工务与电务、检车之间有联系，电务与检车之间也有联系。总之，机、车、工、电、检之间相互都有联系。在这样许多联系当中，哪个联系是主要的呢？我们从如何多快好省地完成国家的运输任务来看，从如何根据现有的运输条件解决运量与运能之间的主要矛盾来看，车站快装快卸与机车多拉快跑之间的联系是主要的。当然，这并不是说机、工、电、检或车、工、电、检之间联系不重要，而是说在机、车、工、电、检互相配合的正常情况下，要想完成或超额完成国家的运输任务，必须首先抓住成为主要矛盾的运量与运能的机务与车务之间的联系。因为，它们的联系是与运货多少有直接的关系，而工、电、检与机务、车务之间的联系，却是保证机务和车务的工作顺利进行的各个方面。这种互相联系的主次之分，是事物本身客观存在的东西。如果在铁路运输中，把机、车、工、电、检之间的联系同等看待，而不重点地抓住快装快卸与机务的多拉快跑之间的联系，那是完不成运输任务的。这种主要的联系，在运输正常情况下就是工作的重点。
    上面这些事实说明，世界上万事万物都是互相联系和互相影响的，没有一种与其他事物无关而单独存在的事物。因此，我们在作任何工作的时候，一定要有一盘棋的思想。这种一盘棋的思想，就是根源于毛主席所说的
  “每一事物的运动都和它的周围其他事物互相联系着和互相影响着”的哲学原理。
    那末，一盘棋的思想会不会影响每只棋子的积极性呢？完全不会。因为，每只棋不能离开一盘棋，每只棋与一盘棋的任务是一致的，都是为了战胜对方。我们铁路运输工作与全国其他各部门的工作一样，也是起的一只棋子的作用。在保证钢铁元帅升帐的时候，我们就尽一切力量为钢铁元帅开道，在运输秩序上就要考虑先运哪个，后运哪个。铁路运输部门是国家机构的一个部门，绝不能离开国家的总任务，自己爱运啥就运啥。每个单位要想把本部门的工作搞好，也必须与国家的总任务联系起来。像我们段上先进的304和1588两个包车组，他们在完成运输任务的时候，就首先考虑到全局，把小组的运输任务与整个的运输任务联系在一起，把个人的工作与社会主义的建设事业联系在一起，到各站去主动地找活干。他们提出：“有机车就挂，有货就拉”；“调度员指到哪里就干到哪里”。他们还提出：“超轴还要快跑”。因此，他们不仅超额地完成了国家所交给他们的运输任务，而且还创造了很多先进经验，带动了其他包车组的工作。这是他们没有离开完成国家的总任务的要求，发挥自己的积极性和创造性的结果。这证明一盘棋的思想不会影响一只棋的积极性。相反，只有首先树立了一盘棋的思想，才能正确地认识到一只棋在一盘棋中的地位和作用，充分地发挥一只棋子的积极性和创造性。
    一只棋与一盘棋的关系也不是僵死的，在一定的条件下它们的地位是可以变化的。全国是一盘棋，每个厂矿、企业或其他部门是一只棋。但是，如果把一个工厂作为一盘棋来看，那末在这个工厂内的每个车间又是一只棋。如果把一个车间作为一盘棋来看，那末在这个车间内的每个小组又是一只棋。因此，每个单位既是一只棋，又是一盘棋。这就是说，要从事物的互相联系和互相影响中来看问题，不能孤立地只看到自己单位是一只棋子的作用，而看不到它还有一盘棋的意义。
    总之，一盘棋的思想是建立在事物的互相联系和互相影响的原理之上的，它就是共产主义大协作的思想。谁要是用互相联系和互相影响的观点来观察和处理问题，谁就工作得好。相反，谁要是只看一点，看不到全面，用孤立片面的观点来观察和处理问题，谁就作不好工作。只有树立一盘棋的共产主义思想，克服本位主义的资产阶级思想，才能搞好本单位的工作，才能完成国家交给我们的任务。工农论文选
