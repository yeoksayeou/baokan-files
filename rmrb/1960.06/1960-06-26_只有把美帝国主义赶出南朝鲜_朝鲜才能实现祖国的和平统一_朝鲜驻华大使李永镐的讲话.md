Dear Comrades and Friends:
    Today, we commemorate the tenth anniversary of the American imperialists launching the bloody war of aggression in Korea on June 25th.
    On this day, the Korean people's hearts are burning like fire, filled with hatred and anger towards the common enemy of mankind, American imperialism.
    This day will never be forgotten not only by the Korean people but also by all peace-loving people around the world.
    It is only natural that the Korean and Chinese people, who directly experienced the horrors of war, designate this day as a day of struggle against wars of aggression, especially against the arch-criminal of imperialism, American imperialism.
    On the front lines of the anti-imperialist struggle, the great Chinese people have always been closely united with the Korean people and have given them active support. I would like to express my deep gratitude here.
    Dear Comrades and Friends!
    As you all know, ten years ago, the American imperialists launched a war of aggression, attempting to "conquer" our Republic, enslave the Korean people, and then expand the war to the Asian continent to realize their ambition of dominating the Far East. For this purpose, they not only投入their own troops but also雇佣兵from fifteen vassal countries, and even violated international conventions by using bacteriological and chemical weapons.
    The heinous crimes committed by the American imperialist invading army during the Korean War were extremely barbaric and unimaginable to civilized people in the twentieth century.
    However, the Korean people, who launched a just struggle for the freedom and independence of their fatherland, with the support of peace-loving people all over the world, inflicted a shameful defeat on American imperialism, which was known as the "strongest" in the world.
    In particular, the Chinese people, at the most difficult time for our people, raised the banner of resisting America and aiding Korea, sending their outstanding sons and daughters to the Korean front and using their blood to aid our people. The heroic spirit displayed by the "most beloved people" - the brave soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army - in the sacred war to eliminate the enemy, American imperialism, and their noble spirit of cherishing the Korean people are still circulating in every village in Korea like a beautiful legend today.
    The historic victory achieved by the Korean people in the Korean War clearly proves that if the people hold power and are led by a Marxist-Leninist party, no aggressive force can subdue them.
    The victory of the Korean and Chinese people completely shattered the myth of the "strength of American imperialism"; at the same time, it was also a major event in history, which infinitely inspired the national liberation struggle of the people of the East and the struggle of the people of the world to safeguard peace.
    After the armistice, the American ruling clique not only did not learn the lesson it should have learned from the disastrous defeat in the Korean War it launched, but also continued to赖in South Korea after the Chinese People's Volunteer Army took the initiative to withdraw from North Korea, and consistently trampled on and破坏the armistice agreement. After the armistice, American imperialism, on the one hand, strengthened the South Korean puppet army, and on the other hand, illegally transported new weapons such as atomic and missile weapons into South Korea, frantically preparing to launch a new war. Due to the war policy of American imperialism and the traitorous acts of its running dogs, the political and economic situation in South Korea is deteriorating rapidly and is full of crises.
    As the South Korean newspapers say, due to economic bankruptcy, the "greatest suffering of the people in four thousand years" has swept South Korea. White terror has reached its peak, and the entire South Korea has become a colonial prison.
    The situation is so cruel that the South Korean people could no longer忍受it, and finally resolutely launched a national uprising to fight for freedom, democracy, and the right to生存.
    American imperialism was frightened, and on the one hand, it hurriedly instructed its running dogs to carry out bloody suppression, and on the other hand, it implemented a policy of appeasement to deceive the people. However, the South Korean people, who fought for justice, democracy, and the right to survival, finally drove the traitor李承晚from the presidential seat. Today, they continue to launch a patriotic struggle against the new李承晚second -許政集團.
    The struggle against American imperialism and its running dogs is surging in Asia. The Japanese people's struggle for independence, democracy, and neutrality has entered a climax. The Japanese people, who have awakened in the struggle against American imperialism, will turn the ratification of the Japan-US Security Treaty into a scrap of paper. Under the pressure of the people's powerful struggle, Kishi Nobusuke has announced his resignation and rolled off the prime minister's position. In Turkey, the loyal running dog of American imperialism, Menderes, is also finished. The flames of the struggle against American imperialism are spreading all over the world; its foundation of aggression is摇摇欲坠.
    Dear Comrades, Friends! Today, American imperialism, which continues to霸佔South Korea and frantically expands its arms and prepares for war, is not only the mortal enemy of the Korean people, but also the common enemy of the people of Korea and China and the people of the world.
    American imperialism is the strangler of freedom and democracy, a vicious colonialist, and an ugly war criminal, and will never change its aggressive nature. The American robbers once sent pirate ships to invade Korea a hundred years ago, and today's facts prove that its aggressive nature has not changed. If there is any difference, it is that the acts of aggression are more cunning and恶劣.
    All the lackeys of imperialism, from the御用 scholars to the right-wing socialists to the Yugoslav modern revisionists, are engaged in all kinds of shameless sophistry in an attempt to "prove" that the nature of imperialism has changed, as if it is no longer engaged in war and aggression. However, no matter how they涂脂抹粉, facts speak louder than words, imperialism is still imperialism.
    It was none other than the American imperialists who sent spy planes to invade Soviet airspace on the eve of the four-power summit, thereby destroying the highest-level meeting and arousing public outrage.
    In particular, Eisenhower's "visit" to the Far East - including South Korea and Taiwan - clearly exposed the aggressive nature of American imperialism, which is frantically preparing to launch a new war under the guise of peace. Eisenhower, the chief culprit of aggression who came here to engage in new war conspiracies in the Far East, was厌恶wherever he went by the awakened people and was driven away by the people with stones. This is only natural.
    The Korean people have learned through their own life experiences that world peace and the peaceful reunification of their fatherland cannot be obtained by "begging" or "requesting" from the enemy. The Korean people are convinced that for the future of their fatherland, there is only one path: to maintain high vigilance, expose and粉碎all the enemy's conspiracies, and continue to carry out the struggle to force American imperialism to withdraw from South Korea. As long as the American troops remain in South Korea, the peaceful reunification of Korea will not be possible, and the peace of Korea will not be consolidated.
    The American imperialists盘踞in South Korea, the root of the Korean people's misfortune, must be eradicated! American imperialism must withdraw from South Korea! - This is the unanimous demand of the Korean people today, and also the command from the conscience of mankind. Today, American imperialism has no excuse to赖in South Korea.
    The Korean people resolutely demand that the United Nations revoke all its illegal "resolutions" on the Korean issue, immediately disband the "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea," and immediately take measures to have the American imperialist aggressive army withdraw from South Korea. The "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea" reports to the United Nations General Assembly every year that "democracy," "freedom," and economic life are "guaranteed" in South Korea. However, it is in such South Korea that the people have launched a national uprising to demand democracy, freedom, and the right to life; and the head of the American aggressors, who clamored that the title of "father of the nation" should be given, is overthrown by the people. It is not surprising that American imperialism cannot provide any answers to all of this.
    Today, not only South Korea, but wherever American imperialism has插足, it is all the same: the nation suffers misfortune, the people shed blood, and tragedies abound. China's territory of Taiwan has become a war and military base of American imperialism, a living hell.
    The American imperialist conspiracy to create "two Chinas" must not be allowed. Taiwan, an integral part of China's sacred and inviolable territory, must return to the hands of the Chinese people. We firmly believe that the Chinese people, closely united around the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, will surely drive the American imperialist robbers out of China's territory of Taiwan and liberate Taiwan.
    Comrades and Friends! At present, the situation in South Korea is becoming increasingly complex, and the people's struggle is becoming more and more intense.
    The only way out to收拾the serious situation in South Korea and solve the living requirements of the South Korean people lies in: the representatives of the North and the South gather together to consult.
    Without relying on the North, which has a solid foundation for an independent national economy, it is impossible to solve the South Korean economy facing bankruptcy and the困苦people's lives.
    Today, under the correct leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government headed by Marshal Kim Il-sung, the northern half of the Republic has completed the socialist transformation in urban and rural areas, and has become a prosperous area without poverty, a powerful industrial-agricultural country with an independent national economy.
    In order to share these brilliant achievements with the people in the southern half, and to seek ways to peacefully unify the fatherland, the people in the northern half have proposed convening a joint conference of political parties and social groups in North and South Korea.
    The unification of Korea is a matter for the Korean people themselves and must be resolved by the Koreans themselves without any external interference.
    As a prerequisite for the peaceful reunification of Korea and the easing of tensions, the American troops must first滚out of South Korea!
    The great cause of peaceful reunification of the Korean people, with the internationalist support of the Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world, will surely be realized.
    Today, opposing American imperialism, driving it out of Asia, out of Africa, out of Latin America, and out of all regions of the world, and thoroughly exposing its crimes has become the most urgent task of all oppressed people striving for peace and national self-determination, as well as peace-loving people.
    The great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and peace-loving people is a guarantee for粉碎American imperialist aggression and safeguarding lasting world peace.
    The Korean people, in strengthening the traditional friendship between the peoples of Korea and China and in the struggle to defend world peace, will do their utmost to fulfill their international obligations.
    American imperialist aggressors,滚out of South Korea!
    American imperialism, 滚out of China's sacred territory of Taiwan!
    Long live the unbreakable friendship and solidarity forged in blood between the peoples of Korea and China!
    Long live the unity of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union!
    Long live the unity of the Asian and African people against the imperialist aggression headed by American imperialism!
    Long live world peace!

### 只有把美帝国主义赶出南朝鲜  朝鲜才能实现祖国的和平统一  朝鲜驻华大使李永镐的讲话

专栏：

    只有把美帝国主义赶出南朝鲜
    朝鲜才能实现祖国的和平统一
    朝鲜驻华大使李永镐的讲话亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
  今天，我们纪念美帝国主义者在朝鲜发动流血侵略战争的六·二五十周年。
    纪念这一天，朝鲜人民心中有如烈火在燃烧，对人类公敌美帝国主义充满了憎恨和愤怒。
    这一天，不仅是朝鲜人民，而且也是全世界爱好和平人民永远不会忘记的一天。
    直接体验到战争惨祸的朝鲜人民和中国人民，把这一天定为反对侵略战争，特别是反对帝国主义元凶美帝国主义的斗争日，是极其自然的。
    在反帝斗争的前线上，伟大的中国人民一直同朝鲜人民紧密团结，并且给予了朝鲜人民积极的支持。对此，我在这里表示深深的谢意。
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们！
    大家知道，十年以前，美帝国主义者发动了侵略战争，妄图“征服”我们共和国，奴役朝鲜人民，进而把战争扩大到亚洲大陆，实现它霸占远东的野心。为了这个目的，它不仅投入了自己的军队，而且还投入了十五个仆从国家的雇佣兵，甚至破坏国际公约，使用了细菌和化学武器。
    美帝国主义侵略军队在朝鲜战争当中所犯下的滔天罪行，是极其野蛮的，二十世纪的文明人简直不能想像。
    然而，为祖国的自由和独立而掀起正义斗争的朝鲜人民，在全世界爱好和平人民的支援下，却使得号称世界“最强”的美帝国主义遭到可耻的惨败。
    尤其是中国人民，在我国人民最艰苦的时期，高举抗美援朝的旗帜，派遣自己优秀的儿女奔赴朝鲜前线，用鲜血援助了我国人民。“最可爱的人”——中国人民志愿军勇士们，在消灭仇敌美帝国主义的神圣战争中所表现的英雄精神，和对朝鲜人民的崇高爱民思想，今天仍然像美丽的传说一般流传在朝鲜的每一个村落。
    朝鲜人民在朝鲜战争当中取得的历史性胜利，清楚地证明：人民掌握了政权，并受马克思列宁主义政党的领导，任何侵略力量也无法使他们屈服。
    朝中人民的胜利，彻底粉碎了“美帝国主义强大”的神话；同时，这也是历史上的一件大事，无限鼓舞了东方人民的民族解放斗争和全世界人民维护和平的斗争。
    停战以后，美国统治集团不仅没有从它所发动的朝鲜战争的惨败中吸取应有的教训，反而在中国人民志愿军主动撤出北朝鲜地区以后，继续赖在南朝鲜，一贯蹂躏和破坏停战协定。美帝国主义停战以后一面加强南朝鲜傀儡军，一面把原子和导弹武器等新式武器非法运进南朝鲜，疯狂地准备发动新战争。由于美帝国主义的战争政策及其走狗的卖国行径，南朝鲜的政治和经济情况江河日下，危机重重。
    正如南朝鲜报刊所说，由于经济破产，“四千年来最大的民生苦难”已经席卷南朝鲜。白色恐怖达到了极点，整个南朝鲜变成了一座殖民地监狱。
    情况如此残酷，南朝鲜人民忍无可忍，终于毅然掀起争取自由、民主和生存权利的全民起义。
    美帝国主义吓慌了手脚，一面连忙指使它的走狗进行血腥镇压，一面则施行怀柔政策，欺骗人民。可是，为正义、民主和生存权利而斗争的南朝鲜人民，到底还是把万世逆贼李承晚从总统座位上赶下来。今天，他们又继续展开爱国斗争，反对新上台的李承晚第二——许政集团。
    反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争，正在亚洲风起云涌。日本人民争取独立、民主和中立的斗争，已经进入高潮。在反对美帝国主义的斗争中觉醒起来的日本人民，将会把日美安全条约批准书变成一张废纸。岸信介在人民强大斗争的压力下，已经宣布下台，滚下首相位置。在土耳其，美帝国主义的忠实走狗曼德列斯也完蛋了。反对美帝国主义的斗争火焰，蔓延到世界各地；它的侵略基础，摇摇欲坠。　　亲爱的同志们，朋友们！今天，继续霸占着南朝鲜、疯狂地扩军备战的美帝国主义，不仅是朝鲜人民不共戴天的死敌，而且也是朝中两国人民和全世界人民的共同死敌。　　美帝国主义是自由和民主的扼杀者，是毒辣的殖民主义者，是丑恶的战争罪犯，决不会改变它的侵略本质。美国强盗一百年前曾经派遣海盗船只侵略朝鲜，今天的事实证明，它的侵略本质仍然没有改变。如果说有什么不同，那就是：侵略行径更加狡猾、更加恶劣了。
    帝国主义的一切奴仆，从御用学者到右翼社会主义者，到南斯拉夫现代修正主义者，进行种种无耻的诡辩，企图“证明”帝国主义的本质已经改变，仿佛它已经不再搞战争和侵略了。但是，不论他们怎样涂脂抹粉，事实胜于雄辩，帝国主义仍旧还是帝国主义。
    在四国首脑会议前夕，派遣间谍飞机侵犯苏联领空，从而破坏了最高级会议，并激起世人公愤的，不是别人，正是美帝国主义者。
    特别是艾森豪威尔对远东——包括南朝鲜和台湾在内——的“访问”，明显地暴露了美帝国主义披着和平外衣疯狂地准备发动新战争的侵略本质。到这里来搞远东新战争阴谋的侵略罪魁艾森豪威尔，走到哪里就在哪里受到觉醒了的人民的厌恶，被人民用石头赶走。这是理所当然的。
    朝鲜人民通过自己的生活体验到：世界和平和自己祖国的和平统一，如果向敌人“乞求”或“请求”，根本就不可能得到。朝鲜人民确信，为了祖国的未来，道路只有一条，即：保持高度警惕，揭露和粉碎敌人的一切阴谋，继续开展迫使美帝国主义撤出南朝鲜的斗争。只要是美国军队还留在南朝鲜，朝鲜的和平统一就不可能实现，朝鲜的和平也不可能得到巩固。
    美帝国主义者盘踞南朝鲜这个朝鲜人民不幸的祸根，必须铲除！美帝国主义从南朝鲜撤出去！——这是今天朝鲜人民的一致要求，也是发自人类良知的命令。今天，美帝国主义者没有任何借口再赖在南朝鲜了。
    朝鲜人民坚决要求联合国取消它有关朝鲜问题的一切非法“决议”，立即解散“联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会”，立即采取措施，使美帝国主义侵略军队撤出南朝鲜。“联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会”每年都向联合国大会报告说：“民主”、“自由”和经济生活，在南朝鲜得到了“保障”。可是，就是在这样的南朝鲜，人民却掀起全民起义，要民主，要自由，要生活权利；而美国侵略者的头子叫嚣说应该赋予“国父”称号的那个李承晚，人民却起来反对他的统治。对于这一切，美帝国主义作不出任何回答，丝毫也不足为奇。
    今天，不仅南朝鲜，凡是美帝国主义插足的任何地方，全都一样，莫不是民族蒙受不幸，人民流血，惨祸丛生。中国的领土台湾，已经变成美帝国主义的战争和军事基地，变成一座人间地狱。
    决不能容许美帝国主义阴谋制造“两个中国”，中国人民神圣不可侵犯的领土的一部分——台湾，必须回到中国人民的手里来。我们坚信：中国人民紧密团结在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党周围，一定能够把美帝国主义强盗从中国的领土台湾赶出去，解放台湾。
    同志们和朋友们！目前，南朝鲜的局势日益复杂，人民的斗争也愈加高涨。
    收拾南朝鲜的严重局势、解决南朝鲜人民生活要求的唯一出路就在于：南北的代表聚首一堂，进行协商。
    不依靠具有民族独立经济稳固基础的北半部，就无法解决面临破产的南朝鲜经济和困苦的人民生活。
    今天，在以金日成元帅为首的朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的正确领导下，共和国北半部已经在城市和农村完成了社会主义改造，变成了没有贫穷的富裕地区，变成了具有民族独立经济的强大的工业—农业国家。
    北半部人民为了同南半部人民共享他们所取得的这些光辉成果，为了谋求和平统一祖国的途径，建议召开南北朝鲜各政党社会团体联席会议。
    朝鲜的统一是朝鲜人民自己的事，必须不受任何外部干涉，由朝鲜人自己解决。
    作为朝鲜和平统一和缓和紧张局势的先决条件，美国军队必须首先滚出南朝鲜！
    朝鲜人民和平统一的伟大事业，在中国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的国际主义支援下，一定能够实现。
    今天，反对美帝国主义，把它从亚洲，从非洲，从拉丁美洲，从全世界一切地区赶出去，彻底揭露它的罪行斗争，业已成为一切争取和平，争取民族自决权的被压迫人民以及爱好和平人民最迫切的任务。
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和爱好和平人民的大团结，是粉碎美帝国主义侵略、维护世界持久和平的保证。
    朝鲜人民在加强朝中两国人民的传统友谊和保卫世界和平的斗争中，将竭尽全力履行自己的国际义务。
    美帝国主义侵略者从南朝鲜滚出去！
    美帝国主义从中国的神圣领土台湾滚出去！
    朝中两国人民用鲜血结成的牢不可破的友谊和团结万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营国家的团结万岁！
    反对以美帝国主义为元凶的帝国主义侵略的亚非人民团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
