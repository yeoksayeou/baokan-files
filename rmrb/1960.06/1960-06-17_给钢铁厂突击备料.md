The fuel and mining bases in the Ji'an region of Jiangxi Province have launched a vigorous campaign to prepare materials, ensuring that steel plants continue to leap forward and achieve high production.

\tAn army of people across the region is engaged in mining and fuel production, working day and night in the high mountains and ridges. They say: "Steel warriors have steadfast will, drive conquers wind and rain, climbing high mountains to mine, unafraid of rocks sharp as knives." The workers' determination statements are plastered all over the work sheds. In recent days, good news has been frequently reported. In the Dongkeng mining area of ​​Dingjiang Commune, Jishui County, daily production was only over ten tons in mid-May, but recently it has risen to 41.9 tons. The Wushishan mining field of the Ji'an City Steel Plant produced more than 400 tons per day in April, and now daily production has exceeded 1,000 tons.

\tLeading cadres of Party organizations at all levels have gone to the front lines of production to participate in and lead production. Liu Chunlai, the general branch secretary, and Ouyang Shanyou, the mine director, of the Wushishan mining field of the Ji'an City Steel Plant, personally led all cadres down to the work areas and sections, and implemented the "three guarantees" (guarantee ideological mobilization, guarantee task completion, and guarantee safe production), which greatly encouraged the workers' enthusiasm for labor.

\tAfter leaders at all levels went down, they not only paid attention to grasping production, but also paid attention to grasping living conditions. The commercial departments delivered daily necessities to the mountains in a timely manner. Many places organized mobile medical teams, film projection teams, and "mobile stores" to serve the "material preparation" army.

\tThe transportation lines in various places are also bustling with activity. Cars, tractors, ox carts, flatbed carts, wheelbarrows, small civilian boats, and small wooden rafts, shuttling day and night, delivering large quantities of ore and fuel to various steel bases.

    给钢铁厂突击备料
    本报讯　江西省吉安地区各燃料、采矿基地，为了保证钢铁厂日日跃进、不断高产，展开了热火朝天的备料高潮。
    全区投入采矿和搞燃料的大军，日夜战斗在高山峻岭。他们说：“钢铁战士意志坚，干劲战胜风雨天，攀上高山忙采矿，不怕岩石刀样尖。”各山头工棚，里里外外到处贴满了战士们的决心书。这几天来，捷报频传。吉水县丁江公社栋坑采矿区，在5月中旬日产只有十多吨，最近上升到四十一点九吨。吉安市钢铁厂乌石山采矿场，4月份日产四百多吨，现在日产已超过千吨大关。
    各级党组织的领导干部，都深入生产第一线，参加生产，领导生产。吉安市钢铁厂乌石山采矿场总支书记刘春来、矿长欧阳善友，亲自率领全体干部下到各工区、工段，并且实行了三包（包思想发动、包任务完成、包安全生产），大大鼓舞了工人们的劳动热情。
    各级领导干部下去后，不仅注意抓生产，还注意抓生活。商业部门把日用品及时送到山上。许多地方组织了巡回医疗队、电影放映队和“随军商店”，为备“粮”大军服务。
    各地交通运输线上也热火朝天。汽车、拖拉机、牛拉车、大板车、手推车、小民船、小木排等，日夜川流不息，把大批矿石、燃料源源不绝地送到了各钢铁基地。
