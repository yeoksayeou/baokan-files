    We Must Settle the Blood Debt Owed by U.S. Imperialism
    Worker-Militia Representative Zhao Shumin

    Comrades of the Militia:
    U.S. imperialism has occupied our sacred territory of Taiwan for ten years. Ten years ago, American aggressors provoked the war of aggression against Korea, and at the same time, armed occupation of our territory Taiwan. For ten years, U.S. imperialism has been running amok and acting tyrannically in Taiwan, turning the beautiful and rich island of Taiwan into a living hell. Under the iron heel of U.S. imperialism, our Taiwan compatriots are living a life worse than slaves. For ten years, U.S. imperialism has used Taiwan as a springboard for further military provocations and various espionage activities against our mainland, creating tension, threatening peace in the Far East and the world, disrupting our socialist construction, and constantly violating our territorial waters and airspace. We must settle every blood debt that U.S. imperialism owes to our people.

    The chieftain of U.S. imperialism, the warmonger Eisenhower, disregarding the firm opposition of the Chinese people, recently broke into our sacred territory of Taiwan, stepping up war preparations against our people. This is another intolerable provocative act against our 650 million people. However, now is the era when the East wind prevails over the West wind. The people's anger has been ignited, and imperialism can no longer run rampant everywhere. Eisenhower's gangster trip to the Far East this time has been met with blows from the people everywhere, resulting in a shameful failure. Our People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front held an armed demonstration against U.S. imperialism, expressing the Chinese people's contempt and scorn for U.S. imperialism. The Japanese people have also united more and more widely, carrying out a mass struggle of the whole people against U.S. imperialism and its agents, blocking Eisenhower and forcing the U.S. running dog Nobusuke Kishi to step down. This is a great victory for the Japanese people. The people of the Philippines and South Korea have also given this warmonger a severe blow, forcing Eisenhower to sneak back to the United States with his tail between his legs in a situation where he was besieged on all sides and everyone shouted to beat him. The paper tiger face of U.S. imperialism has been exposed once again in front of the people of the world, and its two-faced tactics of "sham relaxation, real war preparation; sham peace, real aggression" have been recognized by more and more people. We must continue to persist in the struggle, and we must drive U.S. imperialism out of Taiwan, out of Japan, out of South Korea, out of the Philippines, out of South Vietnam, and out of the Western Pacific!

    Comrades, defending the integrity of our motherland's territory and liberating our Taiwan compatriots who are in deep waters is the sacred duty of our militia. We have the determination and confidence to liberate the territory of our motherland, Taiwan. All of our worker-militia must strengthen military training, constantly improve our political awareness and military skills, and be ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time! If U.S. imperialism dares to provoke a war against our country, we will beat them until their heads are broken and bleeding. Let us unite with the people of the world and fight to the end to overthrow U.S. imperialism and defend world peace.

    一定要清算美帝欠下的血债
    工人民兵代表　赵淑敏民兵同志们：
    美帝国主义霸占我国神圣的领土台湾已经十年了，十年前，美国侵略者挑起了侵朝战争，同时，武装霸占了我国的领土台湾。十年来，美帝国主义在台湾胡作非为、横行霸道，使美丽富饶的台湾岛变成了人间大地狱。在美帝国主义的铁蹄下，台湾同胞过着牛马不如的奴隶生活。十年来，美帝国主义以台湾作为进一步向我国大陆进行军事挑衅和各种间谍活动的跳板，制造紧张局势，威胁远东和世界和平，破坏我国的社会主义建设，不断地侵犯我国的领海和领空。美帝国主义欠下我国人民的每一笔血债，我们都一定要清算。
    美帝国主义的头子，战争瘟神艾森豪威尔，不顾我国人民的坚决反对，最近闯进了我国神圣领土台湾，加紧对我国人民进行战争的准备，这是对我国六亿五千万人民又一次不可容忍的挑衅行为。但是，现在是东风压倒西风的时代，人民的怒火已经起来，帝国主义再也不能到处横行霸道了。艾森豪威尔这次来远东的强盗旅行，到处受到了人民的打击，遭到了可耻的失败。我们福建前线人民解放军举行了反对美帝国主义的武装大示威，表达了我国人民对美帝国主义蔑视和鄙视的心情。日本人民也越来越广泛地团结起来，对美帝国主义及其代理人进行了全民性的群众斗争，挡住了艾森豪威尔，逼使美国走狗岸信介滚下台去。这是日本人民的巨大胜利。菲律宾和南朝鲜的人民同样给了这个战争瘟神以严重的打击，使得艾森豪威尔不得不在四面楚歌，人人喊打的情况下，夹着尾巴溜回美国去了。美帝国主义纸老虎的面目，在全世界人民的面前又一次被戳穿了，它的“假和缓、真备战，假和平、真侵略”的两面手法，已经被愈来愈多的人们所识破了。我们一定还要坚持斗争，一定要把美帝国主义赶出台湾，赶出日本，赶出南朝鲜，赶出菲律宾，赶出南越，赶出西太平洋！
    同志们，保卫我们祖国领土的完整，解放水深火热中的台湾同胞，这是我们民兵的神圣职责，我们有决心、有信心解放祖国的领土台湾。我们全体工人民兵要加强军事训练，不断地提高政治觉悟和军事本领，随时准备响应祖国对我们的召唤！如果美帝国主义胆敢对我国挑起战争，我们就要打得它头破血流。让我们和全世界人民团结起来，为打倒美帝国主义，保卫世界和平而奋斗到底。
