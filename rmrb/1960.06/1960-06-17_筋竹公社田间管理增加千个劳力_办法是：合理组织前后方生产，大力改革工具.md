This newspaper's Nanning dispatch on the 16th: The labor force of Jinzhu Commune in Cenxi County, Guangxi, appears particularly strained. According to calculations, in the first half of this year, the labor days spent on a series of tasks such as planting and care for early rice and dryland crops before harvest will increase by at least 300,000 compared to last year, a 36% increase over the actual labor used in the same period last year. At the same time, significant development is also needed this year in various productions such as industry, forestry, animal husbandry, fishery, and sideline occupations. Under such circumstances, Jinzhu Commune, after in-depth investigation and assessment, has adopted measures to compress the surplus labor force in the rear and in various industries, adding 1,008 laborers to the front line of agricultural production.

Will transferring this batch of laborers to the agricultural front lead to a deviation of only focusing on agriculture and neglecting other aspects? In fact, it is not the case. For example, in one canteen of Jinzhu Brigade, out of the previous twelve people, six cooked dishes, four gathered firewood, and two carried rice. Now, simply by changing eight single stoves to one continuous stove, only four cooks are needed to properly handle tasks such as fetching water, boiling water, cooking, and preparing dishes.

In solving the difficulty of labor shortage, Jinzhu Commune not only adopted the method of "compressing," but also adopted various methods such as "exchanging," "combining," "concentrating," and "reforming" according to different situations, so that labor potential could be fully utilized. "Exchanging" means exchanging the weak for the strong, transferring strong labor from the rear to the front. The commune exchanged more than 170 strong laborers from personnel such as nannies. "Combining" means requiring everyone to be versatile and do multiple jobs. The widespread implementation of cattle herders also accumulating fertilizer, and sideline workers going to the mountains also gathering firewood, etc., has invisibly increased the commune's labor force by more than 800 people. "Concentrating" means, while ensuring the proper handling of agriculture, organizing forces for short-term concentrated efforts for other seasonal productions (such as the harvesting and peeling of cassia bark). "Reforming" refers to tool reform. The promotion and use of weeding machines, hydraulic processing, and indigenous tap water equipment has greatly improved work efficiency.

As a result of the overall adjustment of the labor force in Jinzhu Commune, the labor force invested in field management has increased from 4,754 before the adjustment to 5,762, bringing about a new situation in the field management campaign, with the daily progress of weeding increasing from the original 1,218 mu to 2,763 mu.

### 筋竹公社田间管理增加千个劳力  办法是：合理组织前后方生产，大力改革工具

    筋竹公社田间管理增加千个劳力
    办法是：合理组织前后方生产，大力改革工具
    本报南宁16日电　广西岑溪县筋竹公社的劳动力显得格外紧张。据计算，今年上半年，全社早稻和旱地作物在收获前用在种植和护理等一系列工作的劳动日，起码要比去年增加三十万个，比去年同期实际用工量增加36％。同时，今年在工、林、牧、渔、副业等各项生产上，也要大发展。在这样的情况下，筋竹公社经过深入地调查摸底，采取压缩后方及各行业多余劳动力的办法，给农业生产第一线增添了一千零八个劳动力。
    把这批劳动力抽调到农业战线上来，会不会出现只顾农业丢掉其他的偏向呢？事实上并不是这样。如筋竹大队的一个食堂，过去的十二人中，煮菜做饭的六人，打柴的四人，挑米的两人。如今，仅仅由于八个单灶改为一个连环灶，只需四个炊事员就把挑水、烧水、煮饭、做菜等工作搞的妥妥当当。
    筋竹公社在解决劳动力不足的困难中，不仅采取“压”的办法，同时还按不同情况采取了“换”、“套”、“突”、“改”等多种办法，使劳动潜力得到充分发挥。“换”，就是以弱换强，把强的劳动力从后方换到前方来。全社从保姆等人员中共换出了一百七十多个强劳动力。“套”就是要求人人当多面手，干多种活。普遍推行看牛人员兼积肥料，上山的副业人员兼打柴等，这样全社无形中增多了八百多个劳动力。“突”就是在保证搞好农业的同时，对于季节性强的其他方面的生产（如桂皮的收剥等），组织力量进行短期突击。“改”就是工具改革。推广使用耘田器，水力加工和土自来水设备，大大提高了工效。
    筋竹公社全面调整劳动力的结果，投入田间管理的劳动力，由调整前的四千七百五十四人增加到五千七百六十二人，使田间管理运动出现了一个崭新的局面，耘田的日进度由原来的一千二百一十八亩增加到二千七百六十三亩。
