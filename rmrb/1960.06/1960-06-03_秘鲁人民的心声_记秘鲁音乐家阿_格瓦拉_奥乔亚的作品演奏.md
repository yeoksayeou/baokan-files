    —Recalling the Performance of Works by Peruvian Musician A. Guevara Ochoa
    Lí Guóquán
    The renowned Peruvian musician A. Guevara Ochoa visited China at the invitation of the Chinese Association for Friendship with Latin America. On May 30th, the Chinese Association for Friendship with Latin America specially invited him to collaborate with the Central Experimental Opera House Orchestra to hold a concert, performing A. Guevara Ochoa's works and some Chinese works, which achieved great success.
    A. Guevara Ochoa is an outstanding composer who has written many excellent works such as symphonies, ballet music, vocal music, and instrumental ensemble solos. These works are all based on Peru's rich folk music and are closely linked to the joys and sorrows of the Peruvian people.
    The string ensemble piece "Cuzco" was written by the author with love for his hometown, the ancient Inca city of Cuzco, describing the people as the true creators of this ancient cultural city. The music praises the labor of the people of Cuzco. "Peruvian Dance" describes the labor of the Indians in the high mountain regions. The author uses the unique dance rhythm of the Indians to write out their unyielding character. "Criollo Dance", also known as "Memories of Lima," is a dance from the coastal area. The author skillfully uses the short bow technique of string instruments to express the rhythm of the Indians drumming during festivals. This rhythm highlights the beautiful melody influenced by Spanish music, vividly portraying the working life of the people in the coastal areas of Peru.
    A large orchestral piece was also introduced at the concert, namely the symphonic poem "Yaraví and Huayno," which describes the Peruvian people's praise for the land, the sun, and the Andes Mountains, because the land and the sun are the source of people's lives, and the Andes Mountains symbolize the strong character of the Peruvian people. At the same time, the work profoundly reflects the indomitable fighting spirit of the kind and simple Peruvian people who are suffering from oppression, and their confidence in the future. The music in "Yaraví" and "Huayno" also has national characteristics, among which the music of "Huayno" is a typical example of Peruvian national music. It not only has a broad mass base in its own country, but also has a great influence on the music culture of the entire Latin America. The author has made further creative developments on this basis, giving it greater artistic appeal, thereby inspiring people. In short, these works are the fruits of the author's hard work and the voice of the Peruvian people.
    A. Guevara Ochoa is not only an outstanding composer, but also an excellent violinist. In this concert, in addition to conducting, he also played his own violin pieces "Lament of the Andes" and "Acoliyo City." Through the author's own skilled technique and beautiful timbre, he fully expressed the Peruvian people's loyalty to the motherland. His performances and his works were equally warmly welcomed by the audience in the capital. Although we are separated from Peru by thousands of miles, its music, rhythm, is so fresh, the melody is so beautiful, and the national colors are so strong, that we feel very close and leave a deep impression on people.
    A. Guevara Ochoa is an artist with a high degree of musical accomplishment. His musical creation and performance work, carried out under difficult living conditions and various difficulties, is of great significance to the development of Peruvian music culture, and therefore he enjoys a high reputation in the hearts of the Peruvian people. We admire his persistent spirit of working for the people; we are truly honored to have the opportunity to cooperate with such an outstanding artist from Latin America. In addition to allowing us to hear the beautiful Peruvian music at the concert, he also conducted the performance of Chinese works, which is also gratifying. We have not only gained a deeper understanding of each other, but also established a profound friendship. We wish A. Guevara Ochoa smooth and successful work! May the friendship between the people of China and Peru last forever!

    秘鲁人民的心声
    ——记秘鲁音乐家阿·格瓦拉·奥乔亚的作品演奏
    黎国荃
    秘鲁著名音乐家阿·格瓦拉·奥乔亚应中国拉丁美洲友好协会的邀请前来我国访问，5月30日中国拉丁美洲友好协会特邀他与中央实验歌剧院管弦乐团合作举行音乐会，演奏了阿·格瓦拉·奥乔亚的作品以及部分中国作品，获得了极大的成功。
    阿·格瓦拉·奥乔亚是一位杰出的作曲家，写过交响乐，芭蕾音乐，声乐以及器乐合奏独奏等不少优秀的作品，这些作品又都是在秘鲁丰富的民间音乐的基础上写成的，它们紧密地和秘鲁人民的欢乐和痛苦联系在一起。
    弦乐合奏曲“古斯各”是作者怀着对故乡“古斯各”这座古老的印第安人城市的热爱，描写了人民才真正是这座文化古城的创造者。乐曲歌颂了古城人民的劳动。“秘鲁舞曲”是描写印第安人在高山地区进行劳动的乐曲，作者用印第安人特有的舞蹈节奏写出了印第安人倔强的性格。“哥里欧约舞曲”又称“里玛的回忆”是一首沿海地区的舞曲，作者以弦乐器的短弓奏法巧妙地表现出印第安人在节日里击鼓时的节奏。在这一节奏中烘托出受西班牙音乐影响的美妙的旋律，它生动地表现了秘鲁沿海地区人民的劳动生活。
    在音乐会中还介绍了一首大型管弦乐曲，即交响音诗“亚拉维和瓦依诺”，它描写了秘鲁人民对土地、太阳和安底斯山的歌颂，因为土地和太阳是人民生活的源泉，而安底斯山象征着秘鲁人民的坚强性格。同时在作品中，深刻地反映了受压迫痛苦煎熬的善良质朴的秘鲁人民不屈不挠的斗争精神，和他们对未来所怀的信心。在“亚拉维”和“瓦依诺”中同样具有民族特色的音乐，其中“瓦依诺”的音乐更是秘鲁民族音乐的典型，它不仅在本国有广大的群众基础，对整个拉丁美洲的音乐文化也产生了巨大的影响，作者在这一基础上又有了进一步创造性的发展，使它具有更大的艺术感染力量，从而使人们得到鼓舞。总之，这些作品都是作者辛勤劳动的果实，也是秘鲁人民的心声。
    阿·格瓦拉·奥乔亚不仅是一位出色的作曲家，同时还是一位优秀的小提琴演奏家。他在这次的音乐会中除担任指挥外，还演奏了他自己的小提琴曲“安底斯山的叹息”和“阿哥里约城”，通过作者本人纯熟的技巧和具有优美的音质的演奏，充分表达了秘鲁人民忠实于祖国的精神，他的演奏和他的作品同样都受到了首都听众热烈的欢迎。我们和秘鲁虽遥隔万里，但她的音乐，节奏是如此新鲜，曲调是如此美妙，民族色彩又是如此浓厚，使我们感到十分亲切，给人们留下了深刻的印象。
    阿·格瓦拉·奥乔亚是一位有高度音乐素养的艺术家，他在艰苦的生活环境和种种困难的条件下所从事的音乐创作和演奏工作，对于秘鲁的音乐文化的发展有着重要的意义，因而他在秘鲁人民心目当中享有很高的信誉。我们对他这种坚持不渝的、为人民工作的精神表示钦佩；我们能有机会和这样一位来自拉丁美洲的杰出的艺术家合作，实在是一件荣幸的事情。他在音乐会中除了使我们听到美妙的秘鲁音乐之外，还指挥了中国作品的演奏，这也是令人高兴的。我们彼此之间不但有了进一步的了解，还建立了深厚的友谊。祝阿·格瓦拉·奥乔亚的工作顺利和成功！愿中秘两国人民的友谊永存！
