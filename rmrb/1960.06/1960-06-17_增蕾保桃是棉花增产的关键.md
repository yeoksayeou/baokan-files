    Increasing Buds and Preserving Bolls is Key to Increasing Cotton Production

    Cotton in most areas of our country has entered the budding stage. The level of cotton field yield depends on the number of cotton bolls. The number of cotton bolls depends on two factors: First, on the basis of reasonable close planting, ensure that cotton plants grow and develop fully, producing more buds and bolls; second, vigorously overcome the phenomenon of bud and boll abscission, and strive to increase bud and boll preservation.

    At present, the number of buds in our cotton fields is very large, but the rate of bud and boll abscission is also very high, generally above 70%. This on the one hand illustrates the importance of preventing bud and boll abscission in cotton production, and on the other hand, it shows how much production potential can be unlocked by grasping the key to increasing bud and boll preservation. Calculated at five thousand plants per mu of cotton field, if each cotton plant preserves an average of one more boll, each mu can increase production by fifteen jin of ginned cotton; if an average of thirty bolls can be preserved per plant, a high yield of four hundred and fifty jin of ginned cotton per mu can be achieved. It can be seen that increasing bud and boll preservation is the key to increasing cotton production.

    Boll abscission has always been a prominent problem in cotton production. In the past, some bourgeois scholars believed that cotton boll abscission was an inevitable phenomenon, a natural law that could not be controlled by human power. This is a wrong statement. The reason why cotton bolls abscise is caused by certain external and internal causes, and it is not elusive or unavoidable; as long as we find the cause of boll abscission and master the law of boll abscission, we can fully exert human subjective initiative and effectively overcome the phenomenon of boll abscission. In recent years, we have done this in the practice of cotton production increase and scientific research, and have achieved many successful experiences.

    Why do cotton buds and bolls abscise? There are two main reasons that cause cotton bud and boll abscission: one is that the cotton's nutrition is insufficient or the supply is imbalanced, and the buds and bolls do not get the necessary nutrition; the other is that diseases, insect pests, or other unfavorable external factors directly or indirectly damage the tissues of the buds and bolls. Therefore, to solve the problem of cotton bud and boll abscission, we must fully meet its requirements for necessary living conditions according to the growth characteristics of cotton, and at the same time vigorously overcome all natural disasters. The better these tasks are done, the greater the effect of increasing bud and boll preservation.

    In order to increase bud and boll preservation, after the cotton enters the budding stage, we must focus on grasping the four characters of water, fertilizer, protection, and management in the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture.

    The first is to grasp "water." When cotton enters the budding, flowering, and boll-forming period, the amount of water required increases greatly. This year, most cotton-growing areas in the north have been short of rain for a long time, and the soil moisture in cotton fields is insufficient. At present, the drought situation is still developing, and many cotton seedlings are growing slowly and weakly as a result. These cotton fields should be irrigated as soon as possible; at the same time, topdressing should be applied appropriately to promote seedling growth. This year, the water conservancy conditions in cotton fields are better, and the ability to resist disasters has been increased. We must give full play to the role of water conservancy conditions and carry out irrigation in a timely and appropriate manner throughout the cotton's entire growth period, according to its water requirements at different stages. In southern cotton-growing areas, drainage is the main task, and irrigation should also be paid attention to during periods of drought in the summer.

    The second is to grasp "fertilizer." The budding, flowering, and boll-forming period of cotton is the main period for topdressing in cotton fields. This year, in many areas, cotton seedlings have been affected by unfavorable natural conditions during the sowing and emergence periods, and seedling development is weak, so it is necessary to apply topdressing earlier. The chemical fertilizers supplied by the state to cotton-growing areas this year should be used in cotton fields in a timely manner; at the same time, we must accumulate and produce fertilizers in many ways to increase the source of topdressing in cotton fields.

    The third is to grasp "protection." Many cotton-growing areas have already experienced cotton aphids, and we must seize the time to eliminate them quickly. We must also prevent and control other cotton pests in a timely manner. Serious insect pests may destroy 80% to 90% of cotton buds and bolls, so it can be seen how important it is to thoroughly control pests. To win the battle against diseases and insect pests, we must strive for the initiative, prepare sufficient medicines and equipment in advance, and eliminate diseases and insect pests in the early stages.

    The fourth is to grasp "management." This mainly involves strengthening the work of cultivating, weeding, earthing up, and pruning in cotton fields. In some areas, due to untimely management, weeds have begun to grow in cotton fields, and this should be quickly overcome. We must ensure that the cotton fields are not compacted and free of weeds through continuous cultivation and weeding. We must prune reasonably, control the growth of cotton plants, overcome the phenomenon of excessive shading in cotton fields, and improve light and ventilation conditions. Pruning and management should be carried out throughout the entire growing period of cotton. Therefore, we must arrange considerable labor to be specifically responsible for cotton field management.

    According to the experience of advanced cotton production units in the past two years, there are several key links in striving to increase bud and boll preservation in cotton, namely, "producing more pre-summer bolls, ensuring summer bolls, and striving for autumn bolls." Producing more pre-summer bolls not only increases early bolls, but also can effectively control the rapid growth of cotton plants after entering the summer, promote the production of more summer bolls, and reduce the phenomenon of bud and boll abscission. Summer bolls are cotton bolls that are formed during the peak flowering and boll-forming period after the cotton plants enter the summer and before the beginning of autumn. They are large in quantity and size, and all mature before frost. They are the main part of the cotton harvest, so they must be preserved. After the beginning of autumn, cotton still has an effective growth period, and can continue to produce buds, flowers, and bolls, so we must make full use of this growth period and strive to produce more autumn bolls. To achieve "producing more pre-summer bolls," we must sow early in a timely manner, strengthen seedling management, and promote early emergence, early development, early budding, and early boll setting of cotton; to "ensure summer bolls," we must do a good job in a whole set of cotton field management work such as topdressing, irrigation, drainage, cultivation, weeding, pruning, and preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests; to "strive for autumn bolls," we must strengthen the late-stage management of cotton, appropriately replenish fertilizer, prevent drought and waterlogging, and thoroughly eliminate late-stage diseases and insect pests. As long as we do these tasks well, we will definitely be able to achieve the task of increasing bud and boll preservation and greatly increasing cotton production.

### 增蕾保桃是棉花增产的关键

    增蕾保桃是棉花增产的关键
    我国大部地区的棉花，已经进入现蕾期。棉田产量的高低，决定于棉桃的多少。棉桃的多少，决定于两个因素：一是在合理密植的基础上，保证棉株充分生长发育，多现蕾，多结桃；一是大力克服蕾铃脱落的现象，尽量增蕾保桃。
    现在我国棉田的现蕾数量是很大的，但是蕾铃脱落率也很高，一般都在70％以上。这一方面说明了防止蕾铃脱落在棉花生产上的重要性，一方面说明了抓住增蕾保桃这个关键，能够发挥多大的增产潜力。以每亩棉田五千株计算，每株棉花平均多保住一个桃，每亩就可增产十五斤皮棉；平均每株能保住三十个桃，就可以达到每亩四百五十斤皮棉的高额丰产。可见增蕾保桃是棉花增产的关键。
    蕾铃脱落历来是棉花生产上一个突出的问题。过去有些资产阶级学者认为棉花蕾铃脱落是一种不可避免的现象，是人力不能控制的自然规律。这是一种错误说法。棉花蕾铃所以脱落，是由一定的外因和内因造成的，并不是不可捉摸、不可避免的；只要找出蕾铃脱落的原因，掌握了蕾铃脱落的规律，就完全可以发挥人的主观能动性，有效地克服蕾铃脱落现象。近几年来，我们在棉花的增产实践和科学研究中，已经这样作了，并且取得了不少成功经验。
    棉花蕾铃为什么会脱落呢？引起棉花蕾铃脱落的主要原因有两个：一是因为棉花的营养不足或供应失调，蕾铃得不到必要的营养；一是因为病虫害或其他外界不利因素，直接间接侵害了蕾铃的组织。因此，要解决棉花蕾铃脱落的问题，必须根据棉花的生育特性，充分满足它对必要的生活条件的要求，同时大力克服一切自然灾害。这些工作做得愈好，增蕾保桃的效果就愈大。
    为了增蕾保桃，在棉花现蕾以后，要着重抓住“八字宪法”中水、肥、保、管四字。
    第一抓“水”。棉花进入现蕾、开花期，需要的水分要大量增加。今年北方大部棉区长期缺雨，棉田水分不足，目前旱情还在发展，不少棉苗因此长的不快、不旺。这些棉田要赶紧灌溉；同时要适当追肥，促进棉苗生育。今年棉田水利条件更好了，抗灾能力加大了。我们必须充分发挥水利条件的作用，在棉花整个生育期间，根据它在不同时期对水分的要求，适时适量地进行灌溉。南方棉区以排涝为主，也要注意伏旱期间的灌溉。
    第二抓“肥”。棉花现蕾、开花、结铃期，是棉田需要追肥的主要时期。今年许多地区的棉花在播种、出苗时期，受了不利的自然条件的影响，棉苗发育较弱，更需要提早追肥。今年国家供应棉区的化肥，要适时用于棉田中；同时要多方面积肥、造肥，增加棉田追肥的来源。
    第三抓“保”。许多棉区已经发生棉蚜，要抓紧除治，迅速扑灭。对于别的棉花害虫，也要及时防治。严重的虫害可能摧残棉花蕾铃的80％到90％，可见彻底治虫是多么重要。战胜病虫害要争取主动，事先准备好足够的药械，把病虫害消灭在初发阶段。
    第四抓“管”。主要是加强棉田的中耕、除草、培土、整枝工作。有些地区的棉田，由于管理不及时，开始发生草荒现象，应该迅速加以克服。必须通过连续的中耕、除草，保证棉田不板结、无杂草。要合理地整枝，控制棉株的生长，克服棉田过分荫蔽现象，改善透光、通风条件。整枝管理要在棉花整个生育期间进行。因此要安排相当的劳力，专门负责棉田管理。
    根据两年来棉花先进生产单位的经验，力争棉花增蕾保桃有几个环节，即“多结伏前桃，确保伏桃，力争秋桃”。多结伏前桃，不仅增加了早桃，而且可以借助这些早桃，有效地控制棉株入伏后陡长，促使棉株多结伏桃，减少蕾铃脱落现象。伏桃是棉株在入伏后立秋前开花结铃盛期结的棉桃，数量多，个儿大，全部在霜前成熟，是棉花收获的主要部分，因此必须保住它们。立秋以后，棉花还有一段有效的生育期，可以继续现蕾、开花和成桃，所以要充分利用这一段生育期，争取多结一部分秋桃。要达到“多结伏前桃”，必须适时早播，加强苗期管理，促使棉花早出苗、早发育、早现蕾、早座桃；要“确保伏桃”，必须做好追肥、灌溉、排水、中耕、除草、整枝、防治病虫害等一整套棉田管理工作；“力争秋桃”，要加强棉花后期管理，适当补肥，防旱抗涝，彻底除治后期病虫害。只要把这些工作做好了，一定可以实现增蕾保桃，大幅度增产棉花的任务。
