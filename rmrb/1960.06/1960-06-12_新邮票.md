      Li Cun  Fat pigs are fat and big, a large litter of piglets, the painter paints a portrait of them, printed into stamps more beautiful than flowers. Stamps are affixed to envelopes, heartfelt words are spoken in the letters, countless words cannot express the full extent, the flowers of life are as red as fire. Hardworking people, prosperous motherland! Writing letters to each other to send greetings, though far apart, we are close at heart, singing together in praise.
    The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has scheduled the issuance of a set of special "Pig Raising" stamps on June 15, 1960. A total of five stamps. The face value is eight fen each.
    This set of stamps was designed by the Stamp Issuing Bureau of the Postal Administration of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, and printed by the Beijing Stamp Factory using photogravure two-color printing. (Attached image)

    ·新邮票·
      李村  配诗肥猪肥又大，猪娃一大窝，画家给它画肖像，印成邮票赛花朵。邮票贴在信封上，知心话儿信里说，千言万语说不尽，生活的花儿红似火。勤劳的人民，繁荣的祖国！互相写信来问候，天涯咫尺共高歌。
    邮电部订于1960年6月15日发行“养猪”特种邮票一套。共五枚。面值均为八分。
    这套邮票由邮电部邮政总局邮票发行局设计，北京邮票厂用影写版二色套印。（附图片）
