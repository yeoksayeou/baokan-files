Xinhua News Agency, June 9th: Guo Moruo, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, received and hosted a banquet this evening to welcome the entire Japanese literary delegation headed by Noma Hiroshi.

During the reception and at the banquet, Guo Moruo had friendly conversations with the friends from the Japanese literary world. He heartily congratulated the Japanese people on their great victories in the just, patriotic, and anti-American struggle. He said that in the past year, the Japanese people's just, patriotic, and anti-American struggle has been surging wave upon wave, with the spearhead of the struggle clearly directed at U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism is the root cause of the Japanese people's suffering, and Eisenhower, the head of U.S. imperialism, is the number one war criminal in the world. He said that the Japanese people are not isolated; the Japanese people's struggle has inspired the Chinese people, and it has also inspired the people of the world who oppose imperialism and defend world peace. The entire Chinese people resolutely support the Japanese people's just struggle, and all peace-loving people around the world support the Japanese people's just struggle. Guo Moruo said that as long as the Japanese people strengthen their solidarity and persist in their struggle, they will surely advance from one great victory to another even greater victory.

In his speech, delegation leader Noma Hiroshi repeatedly thanked the Chinese people for their support of the Japanese people's just struggle. He said that the Chinese people are the true friends of the Japanese people, and as neighbors, it is only natural for the people of China and Japan to demand the development of friendship. At present, the people of the two countries should form a united front to defeat our common enemy—U.S. imperialism. He said that the Japanese people's struggle will definitely continue to develop, persisting in opposing U.S. imperialism until the final victory. With the support of the Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world, the Japanese people will surely achieve victory.

Present at the reception and accompanying at the banquet were Mao Dun, Chu Tunan, Shi Liang, Mei Gongbin, Yang Hansheng, Lao She, Lian Guan, Shao Quanlin, Zhou Erfu, Yang Shuo, Zhao Anbo, and others, as well as Japanese peace activist Kinkazu Saionji in Beijing. (Photo attached)

    郭沫若接见并欢宴日本文学家代表团
    祝日本人民斗争取得更大胜利
    野间宏说中国人民是日本人民真正的朋友
    新华社9日讯　全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长郭沫若，今天晚间接见并设宴欢迎以野间宏为首的日本文学家代表团全体成员。
    在接见的时候和在宴会上，郭沫若同日本文学界的朋友们进行了友好的谈话。他衷心祝贺日本人民在反美爱国正义斗争中取得的伟大胜利。他说，一年以来，日本人民的反美爱国正义斗争一浪高过一浪，斗争的矛头很明确地指向美帝国主义。美帝国主义是日本人民灾难的祸根，美帝国主义的头子艾森豪威尔是世界上的头号战争罪魁。他说，日本人民不是孤立的，日本人民的斗争鼓舞了中国人民，同时也鼓舞了全世界反对帝国主义和保卫世界和平的人民，全中国人民坚决支持日本人民的正义斗争，全世界爱好和平的人民也都支持日本人民的正义斗争。郭沫若说，日本人民只要加强团结的力量，坚持斗争下去，一定能够从一个伟大胜利走向另一个更伟大的胜利。
    野间宏团长在讲话中一再感谢中国人民对日本人民正义斗争的支持。他说，中国人民是日本人民真正的朋友，作为邻居，中日两国人民要求发展友谊，这是理所当然的。在当前，两国人民更应该结成统一战线，打倒我们的共同敌人——美帝国主义。他说，日本人民的斗争一定会继续发展下去，坚持反对美帝国主义，直到最后胜利。日本人民在中国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的支持下，一定会取得胜利。
    接见时在座的和出席宴会作陪的，有茅盾、楚图南、史良、梅龚彬、阳翰笙、老舍、连贯、邵荃麟、周而复、杨朔、赵安博等人，以及在北京的日本和平人士西园寺公一。（附图片）
