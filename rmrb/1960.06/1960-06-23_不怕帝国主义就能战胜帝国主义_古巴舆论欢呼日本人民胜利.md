Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 20th - Cuban public opinion widely comments on the shameful failure of Eisenhower's Far East tour.  "Revolución" pointed out today in its commentary on the struggle of the Japanese people that the Japanese people have shed their fear of imperialism and launched a heroic struggle against military occupation and in defense of democracy and peace.  The newspaper emphasized that the Japan-U.S. "Security" Treaty, passed by the Kishi Nobusuke government through shameless trickery, is fundamentally invalid.  The failure of the United States will soon have repercussions in other countries around the world where the Yankees carry out suppression, bullying, and exploitation.

    "Calle" pointed out that Eisenhower has become the most unwelcome visitor in the world. "Calle" pointed out that the friends of the United States are fascists and U.S. policy is fascist. There is no labor-farmer based political party in any country in the world that is not anti-American.

    "Prensa Libre" pointed out that the anti-colonialist and anti-imperialist struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the collapse of the military dictatorships headed by Washington's agents Syngman Rhee and Menderes, and the currently precarious state of Japan make it clear to the people how weak the current world imperialist forces are. The newspaper said that the United States, this paper tiger, is digging its own grave.

     "Liberación" pointed out that the anti-imperialist struggle of the Japanese people shows that if the people have an unwavering determination to fight for freedom, they are invincible.

    "Verde Olivo" used the struggles of the people of South Korea, Japan, Turkey, and Algeria as examples to point out that the United States' foreign policy is facing crises everywhere.  This is understandable, because it is a policy that violates the fundamental interests of other countries and serves the insatiable and powerful oligarchic groups of the United States.

     "Combate" pointed out that Eisenhower has become the most disgraceful president in the history of U.S. imperialism.

    The Rebel Army Radio commented that imperialism is a negative example for the people.

    The Cuban National Unity Movement sent a telegram supporting the struggle of the Japanese people. The telegram said that today the Japanese people are waging a heroic and noble struggle to break free from the clutches of imperialism and to fight for national sovereignty, and have dealt a fatal blow to the State Department by stopping Eisenhower's odious trip.

    Students from the preparatory school of the University of Havana, in a congratulatory telegram to the Japanese people, expressed their hope that the Japanese people would continue their struggle until the complete liberation of Japan, which is so eagerly desired by all the democratic forces of the world, is achieved.

    不怕帝国主义就能战胜帝国主义
    古巴舆论欢呼日本人民胜利
    新华社哈瓦那20日电　古巴舆论广泛评论艾森豪威尔远东之行所遭到的可耻的失败。“革命报”今天在评述日本人民的斗争时指出，日本人民已经丢掉了对帝国主义的恐惧，对帝国主义展开了反对军事占领、保卫民主和和平的英勇斗争。这家报纸强调说，岸信介政府用无耻的骗术通过的日美“安全”条约是根本无效的。美国的失败很快就会在美国佬进行镇压、欺凌和剥削的世界其他国家中产生影响。
    “街道报”指出，艾森豪威尔成了全世界最不受欢迎的访问者。“街道报”指出，美国的朋友是法西斯分子，美国的政策是法西斯政策。世界上没有任何一个国家中的以工农为基础的人民党派不是反美的。
    “自由新闻报”指出，亚非和拉丁美洲人民反殖民主义和反帝国主义的斗争，以华盛顿的代理人李承晚和曼德列斯为首的军事独裁政权的垮台以及目前日本所处的风雨飘摇的状态，使人民对目前世界帝国主义力量虚弱到什么程度看得很清楚。这家报纸说，美国这个纸老虎正为自己挖掘坟墓。
      “解放报”指出，日本人民反帝的斗争表明，如果人民有了不可动摇的争取自由的决心，他们就是不可战胜的。
    “绿橄榄树报”以南朝鲜、日本、土耳其和阿尔及利亚等国人民斗争为例指出，美国的对外政策到处发生危机。这是可以理解的，因为这是一个违背其他国家的根本利益、为美国贪得无厌的强大的寡头集团效劳的政策。
      “战斗报”指出，艾森豪威尔变成了美帝国主义历史上最丢丑的总统。
    起义军电台评论说，帝国主义是人民的反面教员。
    古巴民族团结运动致电支持日本人民的斗争。电文说，今天日本人民正在展开摆脱帝国主义魔爪、争取民族主权的英勇和崇高的斗争，并且由于争取停止了艾森豪威尔的可憎的旅行而给了国务院以致命的打击。
    哈瓦那大学预科学校学生在致日本人民的贺电中，希望日本人民继续进行斗争，直到取得世界所有民主力量如此渴望的日本的彻底解放为止。
