He has insisted on going down into the mine to participate in production ever since he became the mine director in 1952. He spends more than half of each year underground. His experience is that underground operations have complex and rapidly changing conditions, and only by going deep underground can problems be solved quickly and well.

Tangshan, June 25th (By our reporter) Ge Qingxiang, a miner-turned-director of the Tangjiazhuang Mine in Kailuan Coal Mine, has consistently maintained the excellent style of the working class since becoming the mine director in 1952. He goes deep into reality, deep into the masses, and has excellently completed various work tasks, earning the praise of the miners.

Ge Qingxiang used to be an old worker in the Kailuan Coal Mine. From his long-term life as a miner, he deeply realized that to do a good job in coal mine production, one must go to the site to discover, study, and solve problems. He often said, "Coal mining is an underground operation with complex and rapidly changing conditions. Just sitting in the office listening to reports and studying production is time-consuming and does not solve problems well." Guided by this thought, from the day he became deputy mine director, he insisted on participating in production and leading production. After becoming mine director in 1958, his work became even more arduous than before, but he still insisted on going down into the mine to participate in production. He spends more than half of each year deep underground. By going to the site to research and discuss production, many problems are solved quickly and well. Since March of this year, the coal sludge stored in the settling pond of the hydraulic mining area has been increasing, seriously affecting the circulating water supply for hydraulic mining. The workers reported that the dewatering screen was broken and asked the leadership to solve it. However, some cadres looked at the site and thought it was not the reason and did not replace the equipment. After Ge Qingxiang went deep into the site for detailed inspection, he found large pieces of coal in the ditch, confirmed the workers' opinion, and immediately organized manpower to rush for three days to replace the dewatering screen bottom and repaired the hydrocyclone for removing coal sludge. The problem of excessive accumulation of coal sludge in the settling pond was quickly resolved, ensuring the normal production of hydraulic mining. In April of this year, the second 510 working face in the third mining area was not progressing as fast as the mining because the mining speed was accelerated. It was about to affect the completion of the production task of the entire area, and the employees were very anxious. Ge Qingxiang led the cadres of the mining area to carefully observe and analyze the situation underground, and held a "position" meeting on the spot. According to the rock roof and geological conditions, they changed from inclined mining to strike mining, reducing the amount of tunneling by 120 meters, and widened the length of the working face, enabling the working face to be put into production half a month in advance. The daily coal production increased by more than 300 tons compared with the original design capacity.

"Grasping the grassroots and rooting in the masses" is also an outstanding characteristic of Ge Qingxiang's work. Except for meetings and study, he spends most of his time underground or at the grassroots level, either discussing production with the workers or talking with them, telling the masses directly about the difficulties and problems in production, and inspiring and mobilizing the masses to come up with ideas and methods, so that many key production problems are readily solved. At the beginning of last year, there was a period when the supply of raw materials was not timely. The timber piled in the pillar yard was only enough to maintain seven or eight days of production. Ge Qingxiang personally convened a meeting of the workers and the masses, revealed the family property, explained the urgent significance of saving timber and producing raw coal, and personally organized the masses to visit the pillar yard. The workers were moved and said, "One does not know the value of fuel and rice until one runs a household." Therefore, a vigorous mass movement to save timber was quickly launched. Employees created many advanced methods for recycling, reusing, and substituting timber, which quickly reduced timber consumption by 40%, effectively ensuring the production of raw coal.

Ge Qingxiang always maintains the status of a miner, and his food, clothing, and housing are the same as the masses. The miners said, "After Lao Ge became the mine director, he is still the same as us, without any special treatment or the airs of a mine director. He is our best intimate." Whether it is a grassroots cadre or an old worker, everyone talks freely when they meet Ge Qingxiang. Everyone is willing to talk to him about things and is willing to find him to solve problems.

Under the influence of Ge Qingxiang's consistent adherence to going deep into reality and deep into the masses, it has become a trend for all the department cadres and technicians of the mine to go deep into the front line of production. All the employees of the mine always maintain full labor enthusiasm, and the face of production is changing with each passing day. Last year, Tangjiazhuang Mine completed the national plan in full twenty-four days ahead of schedule and was selected as an advanced collective to attend the National Congress of Heroes. Since the beginning of this year, it has excellently completed the national production plan every month.

    葛庆祥——矿工的贴心人
    他从一九五二年担任矿长以来，一直坚持下井参加生产。一年之中，他总有一半以上时间在井下。他的体会是：地下作业，条件复杂，变化快，只有深入井下，才能够又快又好地解决问题。
    本报唐山25日电　开滦煤矿唐家庄矿工人出身的矿长葛庆祥，从1952年担任矿长以来，始终保持工人阶级的优良作风，深入实际，深入群众，出色地完成了各项工作任务，受到矿工的赞扬。
    葛庆祥原来是开滦煤矿井下的一个老工人。他从长期的矿工生活中深刻体会到，要搞好煤矿生产，必须到现场去发现和研究问题，解决问题。他常说：“煤矿是地下作业，条件复杂，变化快，光蹲在办公室听汇报，研究生产，既费时间又不能很好地解决问题”。在这种思想指导下，他自从担任副矿长那一天起，一直坚持参加生产，领导生产。1958年担任矿长以后，工作比以前更加繁重了，可是他仍然坚持下井参加生产。一年之中，他总有一半以上的时间深入到井下。通过到现场研究讨论生产，使许多问题都解决得又快又好。今年3月份以来，水采区的沉淀池贮存的煤泥越来越多，严重影响水力采煤的循环供水。工人们反映是脱水筛坏了，要求领导解决。可是，有的干部到现场看了看，却认为不是这个原因，没有更换设备。葛庆祥深入现场详细检查以后，发现水沟中有大块煤，肯定了工人的意见，马上组织人力突击三天，更换了脱水筛底，检修好了排除煤泥的旋流器，沉淀池内淤积煤泥过多的问题迅速得到解决，保证了水力采煤的正常生产。今年4月，采煤三区因为回采速度加快，这个区的二五一○工作面掘进赶不上回采，眼看就要影响全区生产任务的完成，职工们非常焦急。葛庆祥就带领采煤区干部一同到井下仔细观察分析，在现场召开了“阵地”会议，根据岩石顶板和地质条件，由沿倾斜开采改为沿走向开采，减少了一百二十米的掘进工程量，加宽了工作面的长度，使工作面的掘进提前半个月投入了生产，每天的产煤量比原来设计能力增加了三百多吨。
      “抓到基层，扎到群众”，这也是葛庆祥搞好工作的一个突出特点。他除了开会、学习以外，大部分时间在井下或基层，不是和工人一起研究生产，就是和工人一起谈心，把生产中的困难和问题直接告诉给群众，启发和动员群众出主意，想办法，因而使许多生产关键问题迎刃而解。去年初曾一度发生原材料供应不及时的现象，柱子场堆放的坑木只够维持七、八天的生产需要。葛庆祥亲自召开工人群众会议，亮明了家底，讲明了节约坑木与当前生产原煤的迫切意义，并亲自组织群众到柱子场参观。工人们感动地说：“不当家不知柴米贵。”于是，一个热火朝天的节约坑木的群众运动很快就开展起来，职工们创造出许多回收、复用和代用坑木的先进方法，使坑木的消耗很快地下降了40％，有力地保证了原煤的生产。
    葛庆祥始终保持一个矿工的身分，吃、穿、住都和群众一样。矿工们说：“老葛当了矿长以后，还是和我们一样，没有半点特殊，也没有半点矿长架子，是我们最好的贴心人”。无论是基层干部，或是老工人，遇见了葛庆祥，无话不谈。大家有事情都愿意找他谈，有问题也都乐意找他解决。
    在葛庆祥一贯坚持深入实际，深入群众的作风影响下，全矿科室干部和技术人员深入生产第一线已经形成风气，全矿职工始终保持饱满的劳动热情，生产面貌日新月异。去年，唐家庄矿提前二十四天全面完成了国家计划，被评选为出席全国群英会的先进集体。今年以来，又月月出色地完成了国家生产计划。
