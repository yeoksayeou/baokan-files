Xinhua News Agency, June 18th, Tokyo: The Japan Congress of Journalists submitted a letter of protest this afternoon to the publishers of seven bourgeois newspapers, protesting the "joint statement" published by these newspapers yesterday that slandered the people's just struggle.

The "joint statement" issued by bourgeois newspapers such as the "Asahi Shimbun," "Mainichi Shimbun," and "Yomiuri Shimbun" referred to the patriotic masses who demonstrated at the Diet on June 15 as "thugs endangering parliamentary democracy" and slandered them for conducting "unacceptable activities."

The protest statement from the Japan Congress of Journalists said that the current political crisis should be the responsibility of the Kishi Nobusuke government because this government took undemocratic measures at midnight on May 19 to forcibly "pass" the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in the House of Representatives.

The protest statement condemned the
"joint statement" of these seven newspapers as an attempt to save the collapsing Kishi Nobusuke and help Kishi Nobusuke "ratify" the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The Japan Federation of Newspaper Workers' Unions issued a similar protest statement to the seven newspapers tonight.

The publishers of the seven bourgeois newspapers had asked many local newspapers to participate in signing this "joint statement," but many newspapers, including the influential local Hokkaido newspaper "Hokkaido Shimbun," refused this suggestion.

    “朝日新闻”等七家报纸诬蔑人民正义斗争
    日本记者会议提出抗议
    新华社18日讯　东京消息：日本记者会议今天下午向七家资产阶级报纸的发行人提交了一封抗议书，抗议这些报纸昨天发表诬蔑人民正义斗争的“联合声明”。
    由“朝日新闻”、“每日新闻”和“读卖新闻”等资产阶级报纸发表的“联合声明”把6月15日向国会举行示威的爱国群众称为“危害议会民主的暴民”，并且诬蔑他们进行了“不能容许的活动”。
    日本记者会议的抗议声明说，造成目前的政治危机应由岸信介政府负责，因为这个政府曾经在5月19日午夜采取不民主的手段在众议院强行“通过”新日美“安全条约”。
    抗议声明谴责这七家报纸的
  “联合声明”是企图挽救濒于崩溃的岸信介；帮助岸信介“批准”新日美“安全条约”。
    日本新闻工会联合会今天晚上向七家报纸发表了类似的抗议声明。
    七家资产阶级报纸的发行人曾要求许多地方报纸参加签署这项“联合声明”，但是不少的报纸，包括北海道有影响的地方报纸“北海道新闻”在内，都拒绝了这个建议。
