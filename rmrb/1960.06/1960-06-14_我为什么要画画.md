In My Position

    Why I Paint
    Lü Xueqin, National Representative of Cultural and Educational Heroes, Peasant Painter

    I am a farmer from Yangshan People's Commune in Linqu County, Shandong Province. I have loved painting since I was a child, but before liberation, my family was so poor that we couldn't even afford food, so how could I have the heart to learn painting? Moreover, I couldn't afford paper and brushes. Despite this, it couldn't break my desire to learn to paint. At home, I used a slate pencil to draw on slate, and in the fields, I used grass sticks to draw on the ground. A poor child living in that dark society had no one to guide them and it was impossible to fulfill their wishes.

    After liberation, the poor people turned over, and I got the opportunity to study. I was so happy that I couldn't sleep well all night. Because I could go to school, I also had the opportunity to paint.

    After graduating from senior high school in 1953, due to the needs of my hometown, I stayed at home to participate in agricultural production. In addition to labor, I still insisted on studying and painting in my spare time.

    During the period of unified purchase and sales, I saw speculative grain merchants and peddlers undermining the unified purchase and sales, endangering the interests of the people. That night, I copied a set of comic strips called "Grain Merchants and Peddlers are Really Hateful," and the next morning I took them to the market to post them. I was jumping in my heart at the time, afraid of being laughed at, but as soon as I posted them, they attracted a large number of viewers. Everyone discussed, "Unified purchase and sales are actually like this. We have grain to sell to the country, don't sell it to these bastards," and they all said that my exposé was correct. Later, I posted several more paintings. Because these paintings attracted everyone's attention, the teachers of local elementary schools soon took action. As a result, there were more and more paintings on the market. My actions were valued by the government, who often held meetings to commend me, encourage me, and help me establish wall newspapers and blackboard newspapers in the village. A propaganda shed was set up in Yangshan market, regularly exhibiting propaganda paintings, cartoons, and other art works, to cooperate with the Party's central tasks for propaganda. Sometimes, in order to exhibit in time, some comrades would help me work all night long. In the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and the Party's general line and tasks during the transition period, as well as the cooperative movement, I used paintings to cooperate with propaganda work. In addition, the Party frequently transferred me to do exhibition work in order to cultivate me. I painted more than 500 works at the agricultural exhibition, water conservancy exhibition, and past and present comparison exhibition, and cooperated with comrades from the county cultural center to paint more than 100 murals.

    After a series of painting propaganda work, not only did my painting ability improve, but also my political and ideological level improved, which strengthened my confidence in serving politics with art. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, many amazing deeds have appeared in various works, which aroused my desire to create even more. I want to use paintings to express the brilliant achievements and amazing deeds made by the broad masses of people under the wise leadership of the great Party and Chairman Mao. Therefore, I created "The Old Couple Go to Beijing" and "Big Corn."

    In order to further cultivate me, the Party also sent me last year with three professional painters from the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Provincial Art Museum to Weifang to collect woodblock New Year pictures. This was a rare opportunity for me. Shandong's folk woodblock New Year pictures are the most popular type of painting among the masses, especially among the peasant masses, because their content often reflects the thoughts and wishes of the peasant masses, and most of them are auspicious images, with fresh colors and a special national style. I followed these characteristics and began to create New Year pictures with new content under the instructions of the leaders and with the help of professional painters, trying to improve them based on the original national form. For example, "Feeding Pigs" adopts the original decorative style of the New Year pictures. In addition, the New Year pictures I created, such as "Good Sideline," "Five Ways to Make Money," and "Eight-Character Constitution," were all created following the above principles.

    In the past ten years since liberation, under the direct cultivation and teachings of the Party, I have gone from not being able to paint to being able to paint, from not understanding creation to being able to create, and I have also been elected as a director of the Shandong Branch of the Artists Association. Recently, I also gloriously attended the National Conference of Heroes in Culture and Education. The Party has given me extremely high honors. What makes me feel most honored is that I personally saw the great people's leader Chairman Mao and Chairman Liu, as well as all the national leaders. Think about it: how could I not be excited! I was so excited that I shed tears of gratitude. How happy I am to be born in this great Mao Zedong era! I am grateful! But there are so many good words in the world, I don't know which one I should say to fully express my heart and my gratitude to the Party and Chairman Mao! In the future, I will resolutely repay the Party and Chairman Mao for their cultivation and teachings with practical actions. I will resolutely study Chairman Mao's works well, implement the Party's literary and artistic policy, not be arrogant or rash, work hard to create, and dedicate the latest and most beautiful art works to our beloved Party and Chairman Mao.

专栏：在我这岗位上

    我为什么要画画
    全国文教群英会代表、农民画家　吕学勤
    我是山东临朐县杨善人民公社的一个农民，从小就喜欢画画，可是在解放前家里穷得连饭都吃不上，哪里有心学画呢，何况又买不起纸笔。尽管这样，也打不断我想学画的心，在家里用石笔在石板上画，在坡里就用草棒在地上画。一个穷孩子生活在那种黑暗的社会里，没人指教。根本不可能达到自己的心愿。
    解放后，穷人翻了身，我得到了求学的机会，心里高兴极了，乐的一夜没睡好。因为能上学，画画也有了机会。
    1953年高三毕业后，由于家乡的需要，我就留在家里参加了农业生产。除了劳动之外，多余的时间我仍坚持学习和画画。
    在统购统销时期，我看到投机倒把的粮商、粮贩破坏统购统销，危害人民的利益，当晚就复制了一套“粮商粮贩真可恨”的连环画，第二天一早就拿到集上去张贴。当时心里直跳，怕被人笑话，谁知一贴出去，就吸引来了大批大批的观众。大家纷纷议论：“统购统销原来是这么回事，咱有粮食卖给国家，千万别卖给这些狗东西”，都说我揭露得对。后来我又画了几幅画张贴。由于这些画得到了大家的注意，不久各地小学的老师们也行动起来了。因而集上的画越来越多。我这样做，得到了政府的重视，时常开会表扬我，鼓励我，并帮助我在村里建立了墙报，黑板报。在杨善集上建立了一个宣传棚，不定期的展出宣传画、漫画等美术作品，配合党的中心任务进行宣传。有时为了及时展出，有的同志还帮我搞一通宵。在抗美援朝和党在过渡时期的总路线总任务及合作化运动中，我都用画配合作了宣传工作。此外，党为培养我，经常调我去搞展览会工作。在农业展览会、水利展览会、今昔对比展览会上，我画出了五百多幅作品，又与县文化馆的同志合作画了一百余幅壁画。
    经过一系列的绘画宣传工作，不但提高了我的绘画能力，同时也提高了我的政治思想水平，坚定了我要以美术为政治服务的信心。1958年大跃进以来，在各项工作中都出现了不少惊人的事迹，因而更激起了我创作的欲望。我要用绘画作品来表现广大人民群众在伟大的党和毛主席的英明领导下所取得的辉煌成就和惊人的事迹。因此，我就创作了“老俩口进京”和“大玉米”。
    党为了进一步培养我，去年又让我和省文联、省艺术馆的三位专业画家一块到潍坊去收集木板年画。这对我来说真是一个难得的机会。山东的民间木板年画在群众当中，特别是在农民群众中是最受欢迎的一个画种，因为它的内容常常是反映农民群众的思想愿望，又多半是吉庆有余的形象，色彩新鲜，并具有特殊的民族风格。我就按照这些特点，在领导的指示和专业画家们的帮助下开始创作新内容的年画，尽量依据原来的民族形式，加以提高。例如：“喂猪”就是采取年画中原有的装饰风格。此外，我创作的年画“好副业”、“五路进财”、“八字宪法”等也都是遵循以上的原则创作的。
    解放十年来，我在党的直接培养和教导下，使我从不会画到会画，从不懂创作到会创作，而且被选为美协山东分会的理事。最近，我又光荣地出席了全国文教群英会。党给了我极高的荣誉。最使我感到荣幸的是我亲眼见到了伟大的人民领袖毛主席和刘主席，以及国家所有的领导人。您们想想：我怎么会不激动呢！激动得我流出了感激的热泪。我生在这伟大的毛泽东时代是何等的幸福啊！我感激！可是世界上这么多的好话，我不知应该说哪一句才能充分地表达出我的心意和对党、对毛主席的感激！今后我要坚决以实际行动来报答党和毛主席对我的培养和教导。坚决好好学习毛主席的著作，执行党的文艺方针，不骄不傲，努力创作，用最新最美的美术作品向我们亲爱的党，向毛主席献礼。
