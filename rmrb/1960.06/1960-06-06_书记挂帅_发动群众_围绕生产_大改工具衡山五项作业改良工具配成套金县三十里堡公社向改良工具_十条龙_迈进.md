　　This newspaper reports that the tool reform movement in Hengshan County, Hunan Province, has formed a boiling scene of everyone innovating, everything innovating, and every trade innovating. The county has successively innovated 686 kinds of tools, with more than 356,000 pieces put into use. This county in February of this year gathered the new tools from all aspects and all regions of the county into complete sets, forming new tool operation "Five Dragons" in five aspects: field operation, short-distance transportation, animal husbandry breeding, agricultural and sideline product processing, and life services. For example, the field operation dragon starts from leveling field edges, plowing, harrowing, raking, transplanting, leveling to building field ridges, from opening ditches in the rice fields to sowing, adding cover, from ditching to sending fertilizer, turning ditches, splashing water, scooping up sludge, from pulling seedlings to transplanting seedlings, from trampling fields to topdressing, pest control, irrigation, and finally harvesting rice, and bundling rice. Twenty-three agricultural activities in six stages, front and back, are all used in complete sets of improved tools or new tools.

　　The great superiority of Hengshan County's comprehensive and complete set of tool innovation is that it greatly improves labor efficiency. For example, accumulating manure, starting with the promotion of the "pit digging device" to dig pits, each person can dig 60 pits per day, doubling the work efficiency; using "amphibious vehicles" for fertilizer transportation, the work efficiency is increased by another quarter compared with ordinary vehicles; splashing water with the "water splashing device" improves the work efficiency by four times compared to using a basket; turning the manure pits has universally promoted the "pit turning device," each person can turn four acres per day, improving the work efficiency by three times. The new tools can also reduce labor intensity. Labor efficiency has been improved, the labor process has been shortened, and heavy labor has become easier.

　　The result of the comprehensive and complete set of tool innovation is that no matter which new tool, once it is promoted and used, it shows its power immediately. For example, in agricultural and sideline product processing, the number of people was reduced from 25,000 to 17,000; service personnel in public canteens were reduced from 20,000 to more than 9,000; animal husbandry breeding personnel were reduced from 17,000 to more than 2,300, while the number of pigs increased by more than 83,000. These three labors alone, after improving the tools, saved a total of more than 33,000 people who were invested in agricultural production. The effect of improved tools on production is even more significant. It not only saves labor and reduces labor intensity, but also improves the quality of cultivation.

　　The main experience of Hengshan County in leading tool reform is: focusing on production and comprehensively reforming tools in complete sets. Various productions and each link in each operation are closely related and mutually influenced and mutually promoted. In agricultural production, this point was not clear enough in the past due to decentralized management. However, with the development of large-scale production after the rural people's communes, and with the continuous development of agricultural technology transformation, this close relationship and influence has become increasingly easy for people to understand. If tool reforms are not vigorously carried out in breeding, agricultural and sideline product processing, etc., a large amount of labor will have to be increased. For example, if there is a pit turning device, but there is no corresponding fertilizer transportation tool, the effectiveness of the pit turning device cannot be fully utilized; if there is a rice threshing machine but the rice harvesting machine is not promoted, the rice threshing machine cannot fully utilize its potential. It can be seen that the comprehensive and complete set of tool reform is not only the need of the objective situation, but also can lay a solid foundation for the realization of semi-mechanization in terms of material, technology, and ideology, and create good conditions for mechanization in the future.

　　Comprehensive and complete tool innovation must fully mobilize the masses and adhere to the mass line. Hengshan County has consistently adhered to the working method of the mass line from beginning to end in the process of invention, manufacture, promotion, and use of each new tool. First of all, the leaders went down in person, the secretary took the lead, and the secretary started to grasp each stage of production. At the same time, for the central links that require the most labor, the largest amount of labor, and the strongest seasonality in production, the method of "leaders give topics, everyone writes articles" is adopted to carry out mass movements. Hengshan County also vigorously trained "seed hands," training more than 20,000 people last year, making them propagandists, promoters, and instructors of new tools.

　　In the comprehensive and complete tool innovation, the Hengshan County Party Committee has always adhered to the principle of "taking soil as the mainstay, combining soil and foreign methods." Now the county is moving from manual operation to using animal power, water power, and electricity as power, and many semi-foreign and semi-soil advanced tools and "automatic" machines have emerged. Many communes and teams are actively using stream water to generate electricity for production and lighting.

　　At present, under the slogan of "fully implement five dragons, one person can do the work of two people," the masses in Hengshan County have great ambitions, the momentum of tool innovation is high, the progress is fast, and the movement is developing in a more extensive and in-depth direction.

　　This newspaper reports that the Thirty Mile Fort People's Commune in Jin County, Liaoning Province, is carrying out a comprehensive reform of tools for agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, fishery, water conservancy construction, transportation, and cooking operations.

　　The Thirty Mile Fort People's Commune is a red flag unit for the comprehensive development of multiple economies in Liaoning Province. This year, various productions have greatly developed, and the prominent contradiction is the shortage of labor. The commune party committee studied the situation of tool reform in recent years and unanimously believed that complete sets of innovative tools are necessary to rapidly improve labor efficiency. Therefore, they concentrated the existing reform tools for various production operations, matched them into dragons according to the production procedures, made up for what was lacking, attacked the "missing doors," and planned to add and manufacture new tools in a planned way, and formulated a tool reform plan of "Ten Dragons." The "Ten Dragons" include complete tool improvement and semi-mechanization of all production processes of ten production operation projects such as grain, peanuts, vegetables, rice, fruit trees, pig raising, transportation, water conservancy construction, agricultural and sideline product processing, and cooking operations.

　　In order to ensure the realization of the "Ten Dragons" tool reform plan, the commune party committee secretary took the lead and established a tool reform committee, and according to the characteristics of the business, adopted the method of "contracting by area, one package to the end," and ten responsible cadres were drawn from the industrial office, machinery management station, and other units, and they were respectively responsible for the "dragon head." The Tool Reform Committee arranged small-segment plans in the spirit of the previous season for the next season and striving for an early start, combined with the central work of each period, and continuously organized three campaigns. Starting from the beginning of February, they worked hard for half a month to realize the "four modernizations" of pig raising (mechanization of feed crushing, steam cooking, vehicle transportation, and self-flowing water). In mid-March, with the commune-run industry as the mainstay, the skilled craftsmen of the whole commune were concentrated and cooperated with the vast number of commune members to work hard for a week, and the semi-mechanization and improved toolization of spring sowing tools were initially realized. In early April, with the support of the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, many tools were further matched into dragons. In the process of greatly changing tools, the commune sent people to other places eight times to "learn from experience," held five on-site meetings in the commune for tool reform selection, finalization, and organization and promotion, and adopted the method of combining cadres, the masses, and skilled craftsmen to jointly research and create, so that the tool reform movement was victorious and improved step by step.

　　With the vigorous development of the mass tool reform movement, in just two months, the whole commune modified, created, and promoted 62 kinds of new tools, a total of 10,400 pieces. The tool reform of six production operations such as grain, peanuts, water conservancy construction, agricultural and sideline product processing, pig raising, and cooking has been matched into dragons. The four production operations of fruit trees, vegetables, rice, and transportation are also being matched. The tool reforms for shelling peanuts, digging peanuts, and threshing peanuts that had never been solved have also been broken through. Due to the successful creation of the peanut shelling machine, the 2.58 million catties of peanut seeds in the whole commune required 64,500 working days for manual peeling, but now it only takes 5,160 working days to peel them, improving work efficiency by 12 times.

    书记挂帅　发动群众　围绕生产
　  大改工具衡山五项作业改良工具配成套金县三十里堡公社向改良工具“十条龙”迈进
    本报讯　湖南省衡山县农村的工具改革运动，已经形成了一个人人革新、事事革新、行行革新的沸腾景象。全县先后革新工具六百八十六种，推广使用达三十五万六千多件。这个县在今年2月就把全县各个方面、各个地区的新工具汇合成套，组成了田间操作、短途运输、畜牧饲养、农副产品加工、生活服务等五个方面的新工具操作“五条龙”。例如田间操作一条龙就从铲田墈开始，犁田、耙田、耖田、插田、平田到搭田塍，从秧田开圳到播种、加复盖物，从打沟到送肥、翻沟、泼水、戽污，从扯秧到插秧，从踩田到追肥、除虫、排灌，最后割禾、扮禾，前前后后六个阶段的二十三种农事活动，全部成套的使用改良工具或新工具。
    衡山县全面成套革新工具的巨大优越性，首先是大大提高了劳动工效。例如积沤肥料，从推行“打凼器”开始打凼，每人每天打六十个，工效翻两番；运肥使用“水陆两用车”以后，比一般车子又提高工效四分之一；泼凼水用“泼水器”，比以前用箢箕提高工效四倍；翻沟凼已普遍推广“翻凼器”，每人每天翻四亩，提高工效三倍。新工具又能减轻劳动强度。劳动工效提高了，劳动过程缩短了，笨重的劳动变得轻松了。
    全面成套革新工具的结果，无论那件新工具，一经推广使用，一针见血，立竿见影地显示了它的威力。如农副产品加工，由原来二万五千人减少为一万七千人；公共食堂服务人员由二万人减少为九千多人；畜牧饲养人员由一万七千人减少为二千三百多人，而猪还比原来增加八万三千多头。只这三项劳动，在改良工具后，共节省出三万三千多人投入了农业生产。改良工具在生产上发挥的效果就更加显著了。不但是节省了劳力、减轻了劳动强度，而且提高了耕作质量。
    衡山县领导工具改革的主要经验是：围绕生产全面的成套的改革工具。各项生产之间，以及每个作业中的每个环节之间，都是密切关联和相互影响、相互促进的。在农业生产中，过去由于分散经营的缘故，这一点使人看得还不够清楚。但是，随着农村人民公社化后大生产局面的开展，随着农业技术改造不断的向前发展，这种相互间的密切关系和影响，已经愈来愈易于为人们所理解。在饲养、农副产品加工等方面不大力进行工具改革，就会要增加大量的劳力。又如在粮食生产中，有了翻凼器，如果没有相应的运肥工具，翻凼器的效用就不可能得到充分的发挥；如果有了打稻机而割禾器没有推广，打稻机同样不能充分发挥潜力。由此可见，全面的成套的改革工具，不仅是客观形势的需要，而且能够为实现半机械化在物质上、技术上、思想上打下坚实的基础，并为今后机械化创造良好的条件。
    全面的成套的革新工具，必须充分发动群众，坚持群众路线。衡山县在每一项新工具的发明、制造、推广、使用的过程中，都自始至终坚持了群众路线的工作方法。首先是领导亲自下去，书记挂帅，每段生产，书记动手抓。同时，对生产上花工最多、劳动量最大、季节性最强的中心环节，采取“领导出题目，大家做文章”的办法大搞群众运动。衡山县还大力培训“种子手”，去年全县培训二万多名，使他们成为新工具的宣传者、推广者、教导者。
    全面成套革新工具中，衡山县委还自始至终坚持了“以土为主，土洋并举”的方针。现在全县正由手工操作迈向以畜力、水力、电力作动力，出现了许多半洋半土的先进工具和“自动”机器。许多社、队正在积极利用溪水发电，用以生产、照明。
    目前，衡山县在“全面实行五条龙，一人作事顶两人”的口号推动下，群众的雄心很大，革新工具的声势很高，进步很快，运动向着更加广泛更加深入的方向发展。
    本报讯　辽宁省金县三十里堡人民公社对农、林、牧、副、渔、水利建设、运输和炊事作业工具进行全面改革。
    三十里堡人民公社是辽宁省多种经济全面发展的红旗单位。今年各项生产大发展，突出的矛盾是劳动力不足。公社党委研究了几年来工具改革的情况，一致认为必需成套革新工具，才能迅速地提高劳动效率。于是，他们把各项生产作业已有的改革工具集中起来，按照生产程序配套成龙，缺啥补啥，大攻“缺门”，有计划地增添和制造新的工具，制订了“十条龙”的工具改革规划。“十条龙”包括粮谷、花生、蔬菜、水稻、果树、养猪、运输、水利建设、农副产品加工、炊事作业等十个生产作业项目的全部生产过程的整套工具改良化和半机械化。
    为了保证“十条龙”工具改革规划的实现，公社党委书记挂帅，成立了工具改革委员会，并根据业务特点，采取“分片包干，一包到底”的方法，由工业办公室、机械管理站等单位抽出十名负责干部，分别担任“龙头”。工具改革委员会本着上季为下季、步步赶早的精神，安排小段计划，结合各个时期的中心工作，连续组织了三次战役。从2月初起大干半个月，实现了养猪“四化”（饲料粉碎机械化、煮食蒸汽化、运输车子化、用水自流化）。3月中旬，以社办工业为主，集中全社能工巧匠，与广大社员相配合，大干一周，初步实现了春播工具半机械化和改良工具化。4月初，又在大连机车车辆厂的支援下，进一步使许多工具配套成龙。在大改工具的过程中，公社曾先后八次派人到外地“取经”，在社内召开了五次工具改革选样、定型和组织推广的现场会议，并采取干部、群众和能工巧匠三结合的办法，共同研究创造，使工具改革运动节节获胜，步步提高。
    群众性工具改革运动的蓬勃发展，仅两个月时间，全社就改制、创造和推广各种新工具六十二种共一万零四百件。使粮谷、花生、水利建设、农副产品加工、养猪、炊事等六项生产作业的工具改革已经配套成龙。果树、蔬菜、水稻、运输等四项生产作业也正在配套。从来没有解决的剥花生、起花生、摔花生的工具改革也被突破了。由于花生脱壳机的创制成功，全社二百五十八万斤花生种，用人工剥皮需要六万四千五百个劳动日，现在只用五千一百六十个劳动日就剥完了，提高工效十二倍。
