This newspaper, Changchun, June 13th. The First Automobile Works is vigorously promoting product revolution, applying over a thousand technical innovation achievements from production and user units to product design in a timely manner, greatly improving the performance of the automobiles and saving manpower and material resources. Now, the dead weight of the "Liberation" brand automobile has been reduced from the designed 4,000 kilograms to 3,760 kilograms, and the load capacity has increased from four tons to five tons, meaning four vehicles can do the work of five.

In order to accelerate the realization of the factory's struggle goal of "250 vehicles per shift, one factory becomes five factories," the Party organization of the First Automobile Works' design department, in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, formed a "250 Vehicles per Shift Promotion Brigade" consisting of dozens of designers, mobilizing workers to participate in product design and improve the automobile structure. They adopted the "three-way combination" method, conducting a comprehensive survey of each machine tool and each process for producing parts, striving to improve the standardization, generalization, and serialization of parts and components. In just two months, they surveyed eleven workshops, thirty-one work sections, and three collaborating factories, reforming over 5,000 parts, accounting for 60% of the "Liberation" brand automobile parts, while ensuring quality. Now, most of these innovation achievements have been incorporated into product design. 50% of the parts are already being produced according to the new design. The production capacity of the newly introduced parts has generally increased by one to two times, with the highest reaching six to seven times. After all the reformed parts are put into production, the entire factory can save more than 300 machine tools and more than 800 workers, and each automobile can save 385 kilograms of metal materials. Based on an annual production of 30,000 automobiles, 11,000 tons of high-quality steel can be saved annually. Due to the reform of product design, simplification of unreasonable structures, and improvement and simplification of technological processes, the realization of production automation has been accelerated. In the past, the miscellaneous parts section of the engine workshop could only produce 120 vehicle sets of speedometer gears per shift; based on the processing characteristics of the newly designed parts, they manufactured a simple and efficient automatic combined machine tool, increasing production capacity to over 800 vehicle sets, while saving three sets of modern equipment and three-quarters of the production area.

In order to combine the production experience of the manufacturing plant's workers with the usage experience of drivers, repair workers, etc., to better improve product design, since February of this year, the Party organization of the First Automobile Works has successively sent people out to visit, invited user units to participate in the factory's automobile model selection meeting, established a product design communication network in the user and repair departments, and hired well-known national automobile drivers and repair workers as special designers of the factory, collecting more than 1,000 technical innovation achievements, further reforming the structure of the "Liberation" brand automobile. For example, based on the innovation experience of many user units across the country, the automobile steering equipment has been improved, making steering very flexible. Many innovation achievements and innovation suggestions from outside the factory reflect the special requirements of different regions for automobile performance, which further adapts the product design of the "Liberation" brand automobile to complex regional characteristics.

    第一汽车厂运用厂内外革新成果修改产品设计
    “解放牌”汽车四辆顶五辆
    自重减轻二百四十公斤　载重量由四吨增加到五吨
    本报长春13日电　第一汽车制造厂大搞产品革命，把生产和使用单位的千余项技术革新成果及时用于产品设计，使汽车的使用性能大大提高，而且节省了人力、物力。现在，“解放牌”汽车的自重已由设计的四千公斤减轻到三千七百六十公斤，载重量从四吨提高到五吨，四辆车顶五辆车用。
    为了加速实现“班产二百五十（辆汽车），一厂变五厂”的全厂奋斗目标，第一汽车厂设计部门的党组织，在技术革新和技术革命运动中，组成了几十名设计师参加的“班产二百五十辆促进大队”，发动工人参加产品设计，改进汽车结构。他们采用“三结合”的办法，按生产零件逐台机床逐个工序地进行普查，设法提高零件和部件的标准化、通用化、系列化的程度。仅两个月时间，就普查了十一个车间三十一个工部和三个协作厂，在保证质量的前提下，对占“解放牌”汽车零件60％的五千多个零件作了改革。现在，这些革新成果大部分都已纳入产品设计。50％的零件已按照新设计生产。新投入生产的零件的生产能力，普遍提高一倍至二倍，最高的有六、七倍。经过改革的零件全部投入生产以后，全厂可以节约机床三百多台，工人八百多名，每辆汽车可以节约金属材料三百八十五公斤，以年产三万辆汽车计，一年可以节约一万一千吨优质钢材。由于改革产品设计，简化不合理的结构，改进和简化了工艺过程，这便加速了生产自动化的实现。发动机车间杂件工部过去加工速度表齿轮，班产能力只能达到一百二十辆份；他们根据新设计零件的加工特点，制造出一台简易、高效率的自动联合机床，使生产能力提高到八百辆份以上，同时节省出三台现代化设备和四分之三的生产面积。
    为了把制造厂工人的生产经验和司机、修理工人等的使用经验结合起来，更好地改进产品设计，第一汽车厂党组织从今年2月以来，先后通过派人外出访问，邀请使用单位参加本厂的汽车选型大会，在使用、修理部门建立产品设计通讯网以及聘请全国著名的汽车司机、修理工人担任本厂特约设计员等办法，集中了一千多项技术革新成果，进一步改革了“解放牌”汽车的结构。例如，根据全国很多使用单位的革新经验，改进了汽车转向设备，使转向变得很灵活。来自厂外的许多革新成果和革新建议，都反映了不同地区对汽车性能的特殊要求，这便使“解放牌”汽车的产品设计进一步适应了复杂的地区特点。（附图片）
