    Reported by our newspaper: Albanian newspapers published on the 3rd Hoxha's speech at the mass meeting in Peshkopi on June 1st. Hoxha is the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party.
    
    When discussing the international situation, Hoxha said that our country's policy is one of peace. Our people, government, and party love peace and fight for peace. When we talk about peace, we truly act on it, fighting concretely for this great cause, and not using empty talk about peace to deceive the people of all countries, like the imperialists and their lackeys, the Yugoslav revisionists.
    
    Hoxha pointed out: The imperialists will stab people in the back whenever they have the opportunity. We will be vigilant against them at all times and in all places. We have never lost our vigilance, nor will we ever lose it. We will be ready at all times.
    
    Speaking of the US spy plane provocation against the Soviet Union, Hoxha pointed out that President Eisenhower's admission that this action was carried out on his orders, that the US government pursues a policy of espionage and aggression against the borders of the Soviet Union and other countries, and that it admits it will continue to do so in the future, reveals the true face of the aggressor.
    
    Next, Hoxha talked about the struggles of the people of South Korea and Turkey. He said: The barbaric rule of Syngman Rhee, the faithful servant of US imperialism who implemented a policy of terror and crime against the people, has been overthrown. The country where Syngman Rhee fell is precisely a country ruled by the US military, and the government that came to power after Syngman Rhee is another tool of the US imperialists, attempting to deceive the Korean people who are still fighting in the streets. The events in Korea show that wherever the US military and the running dogs of imperialism tread, the people there cannot endure the heavy oppression and will rise up to fight. Although there are US armed forces and criminals like Syngman Rhee ruling there, the people believe that as long as they unite, they can overthrow the ruling bosses bought by US imperialism. In Turkey, events similar to those in Korea have also occurred, and the power of the angry people has also overthrown the Menderes government.
    
    In his speech, Hoxha exposed the shameful face of the Tito group of revisionists. He said that the Yugoslav revisionists, headed by Tito, are the most active and most important lackeys of the imperialists. This group is a veritable espionage organization of the imperialists, not only in terms of policy and propaganda, but also in action. The Yugoslav revisionists are traitors to Marxism-Leninism, and they have tried every possible means to undermine the unity of the socialist camp and the unity of the international workers' movement and fraternal Communist and Workers' Parties. However, they have failed and will fail to the end on this shameful path. The unity of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries, with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as the center, is as solid as steel, and such an imperialist running dog as Tito cannot undermine this unbreakable unity. The Yugoslav revisionists have carried out, and are carrying out, thousands of conspiracies against our country. As everyone knows, their main goal in the past and now is to destroy the steel-like unity of our party and the people centered on the party, and to weaken our country's defense and economic strength, so as to annex Albania one day. The Yugoslav revisionists hate our correct, firm, and principled position very much, and we hate them to the extreme. Because they are traitors, revisionists, and those who sell themselves to the imperialists, they do not want our people to have freedom and sovereignty. The Belgrade revisionist leaders shamelessly say, where did the Albanians get this strength, where did they get such great courage, to dare to openly oppose the "powerful Yugoslav great power." Only the reactionary bourgeoisie would say such a thing: that the people of small countries have no right to speak and defend themselves, and this is exactly what the Yugoslav revisionists are doing.
    
    Hoxha emphasized that we will continue to expose the activities of the imperialists and Yugoslav revisionists to the end without reservation, because we have defended peace and socialism, defended our motherland and the great socialist camp in this way in the past. We are friends with the Yugoslav people, we love them now, and we will love them in the future. However, we cannot tolerate the traitorous clique that dominates in Yugoslavia.
    
    Hoxha said that the Yugoslav revisionists are waiting for the most subtle opportunity to curry favor with the imperialists. The piratical act of the US spy plane invading Soviet airspace aroused the indignation of all honest people in the world, but Marshal Tito actually said, why is Khrushchev making such a fuss about this not very important incident. Tito is serving US imperialism in this way.
    
    The enemies of the Albanian people should know that Albania is no longer as isolated as it was in the past, and it now has very strong and loyal friends, first and foremost the great Soviet Union. Our people are closely linked with the great people of China and all other People's Democratic countries in Europe and Asia, and this friendship is growing stronger day by day. Dear comrades and friends, yesterday Comrade Haxhi Lleshi, Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Assembly, led an official delegation at the invitation of the fraternal People's Republics of Asia to pay friendly visits to China, Mongolia, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Albanian people deeply love and admire the heroic Chinese people who are successfully building socialism, and are delighted with the vigorous development achieved by the great Chinese people in socialist construction and in the firm struggle to safeguard their legitimate rights. All countries in the socialist camp regard the aggressive stance of the US imperialists and all their followers in obstructing the great China from entering the United Nations and all international organizations as an international farce. However, the imperialists' aggressive policy will inevitably be defeated. The great Chinese people will surely occupy their rightful place in all international institutions. The Albanian people also deeply love the fraternal peoples of Mongolia, Korea, and Vietnam, and close fraternal friendship links us together. The official visit of the delegation that departed yesterday will help to further strengthen this friendship and further strengthen the fraternal ties and cooperation between our countries. The Marxist-Leninist policies of our countries will surely triumph, and will surely defeat the piratical policies of the US imperialists who are trying to push the world into a new catastrophe. The combined strength of our countries, united as one, is invincible.

    霍查谈当前国际形势
    必须严阵以待对付帝国主义  坚持原则立场揭露修正主义
    本报讯　阿尔巴尼亚报刊3日发表了阿劳动党中央第一书记霍查6月1日在佩什科比群众大会上的讲话。
    霍查在谈到国际形势时说，我国的政策是和平的政策。我国人民、政府和党热爱和平，并为和平而斗争。当我们谈和平的时候，是真正用行动来做的，具体地为这个伟大的事业进行斗争，而不是像帝国主义者和他们的仆从南斯拉夫修正主义者那样，用空谈和平来欺骗各国人民。
    霍查指出：帝国主义者一旦有机可乘就会从人们的背后插进一刀。我们对他们将随时随地保持警惕。我们既没丧失过也不会丧失警惕性。我们将随时严阵以待。
    在谈到美国间谍飞机向苏联挑衅事件时，霍查指出，艾森豪威尔总统承认这一行动是得到他的命令的，承认美国政府奉行对苏联和其他国家边境进行间谍侵犯的政策，承认今后还将干这种行径，这就表明了侵略者的真面目。
    接着，霍查谈到了南朝鲜人民和土耳其人民的斗争。他说：对人民执行恐怖和罪恶政策的美帝国主义的忠实仆从李承晚的野蛮统治被推翻了。李承晚倒台的这个国家正是美国军队统治的国家，继李承晚之后上台的政府是美帝国主义者另一个工具，它企图欺骗仍在街道上斗争的朝鲜人民。朝鲜的事件说明了：凡是美军和帝国主义走狗践踏的地方，那里的人民就不能忍受沉重的压迫，就要起来斗争。虽然那里有美国武装力量和像李承晚之流的罪犯统治着，但是人民相信：只要团结起来，他们就能够推翻为美帝国主义者所收买的执政老板。在土耳其也发生了像在朝鲜所发生的事件，愤怒的人民的力量，也推翻了曼德列斯的政府。
    霍查在讲话中揭露了铁托集团修正主义者的可耻面目。他说，以铁托为首的南斯拉夫修正主义者是帝国主义者最积极最主要的仆从。这个集团是道地的帝国主义者的间谍机构，不仅表现在政策和宣传方面，而且还表现在行动上。南斯拉夫修正主义者是马克思列宁主义的叛徒，他们千方百计地力图破坏社会主义阵营的团结，破坏国际工人运动和兄弟的共产党和工人党的团结。然而，他们失败了，而且在这条可耻的道路上，还将失败到底。以苏联共产党为中心的各国共产党和工人党的团结坚如钢铁，铁托这样一个帝国主义走狗也破坏不了这种牢不可破的团结。南斯拉夫修正主义者对我国进行了、并正在进行着数以千计的阴谋活动。大家知道，他们的主要目的过去和现在都是想摧毁我们党和以党为中心的人民的钢铁般的团结，削弱我国防御和经济力量，以便有朝一日吞并阿尔巴尼亚。南斯拉夫修正主义者十分痛恨我们的正确、坚定和原则性的立场，而我们也痛恨他们到了极点。因为，他们是叛徒，是修正主义者和向帝国主义者卖身的人，他们不愿意我国人民有自由和主权。贝尔格莱德修正主义领导人厚颜无耻地说，阿尔巴尼亚人那里来的这股力量，那里来这么大的勇气，竟敢公然反对“强大的南斯拉夫大国”。只有反动的资产阶级才这样说：小国人民没有发言权和自卫的权利，南斯拉夫修正主义者也正是这样。
    霍查强调指出，我们对帝国主义者和南斯拉夫修正主义者的活动仍将毫无保留地揭露到底，因为我们过去就是这样地保卫了和平和社会主义，保卫了我们的祖国和伟大的社会主义阵营。我们同南斯拉夫人民是朋友，我们现在热爱他们，将来也热爱他们。但是，我们不能容忍在南斯拉夫占统治地位的叛徒集团。
    霍查说，南斯拉夫修正主义者等待最微妙的时机来向帝国主义者讨好。美国间谍飞机侵犯苏联领空的这种强盗行为引起了世界所有正直人们的愤慨，只有铁托元帅竟说，赫鲁晓夫为什么对这一件不十分重要的事件那样地喧嚷。铁托就这样为美帝国主义效劳。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民的敌人应当知道，阿尔巴尼亚已不是过去那样的孤立了，它现在拥有非常强大和忠实的朋友，首先是伟大的苏联。我国人民同伟大的人民中国和所有欧亚其他人民民主国家紧密地联结在一起，并且这种友谊正在日益加强。亲爱的同志们和朋友们，昨天人民议会主席团主席哈奇·列希同志应亚洲各兄弟人民共和国的邀请率领了一个正式代表团启程往中国、蒙古、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国作友好访问，阿尔巴尼亚人民十分热爱和钦佩正在顺利建设社会主义的英勇的中国人民，并对伟大的中国人民在社会主义建设中和维护自己合法权利的坚定斗争中所取得的蓬勃发展感到高兴。所有社会主义阵营各国都把美帝国主义者及其所有的追随者阻挠伟大中国进入联合国和所有国际组织的侵略立场看作是国际上的丑剧。但是，帝国主义者的侵略政策必将遭到失败。伟大的中国人民必将在所有的国际机构中占有它的正当地位，阿尔巴尼亚人民也十分热爱蒙古、朝鲜和越南的兄弟人民，紧密的兄弟般的友谊把我们连结在一起。昨天启程的代表团的正式访问将有助于进一步加强这种友谊，进一步加强我们各国间的兄弟联系和合作。我们各国的马克思列宁主义政策必将胜利，并且必将使得力图把世界推进一次新的浩劫的美帝国主义者的强盗政策遭到失败。钢铁般团结一致的我们各国的联合力量是不可战胜的。
