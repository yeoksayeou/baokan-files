Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 19th: The heroic artillery forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Fujian Front, at six o'clock this morning, continued to direct anti-U.S. demonstration artillery fire towards the islands of Greater and Lesser Kinmen, Greater and Lesser Dadan, and other islands entrenched by the Chiang Kai-shek troops, bombarding and expelling the "Plague God" Eisenhower.

After Eisenhower arrived in our country's territory of Taiwan to carry out rampant war and aggressive activities, he left Taiwan today. In accordance with the order from the Fujian Front Command to fire artillery to "greet and send off," our heroic artillery warriors and heroic militiamen, who guarded their artillery positions day and night, simultaneously opened fire at exactly six o'clock this morning. The heroes shouted with激愤: "Send off the plague god, fire!" For a time, roars of "Eisenhower get out!" "Resolutely liberate the motherland's territories of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu!" "Resolutely support the just struggle of the people of Asian countries against Eisenhower's bandit trip!" "Resolutely fight the U.S. imperialism to the end!" and the thunderous sound of cannons shook the Taiwan Strait at dawn.

The demonstration artillery fire to send off the "Plague God" continued to rage until Eisenhower rolled away from Taiwan.

    艾森豪威尔到我国领土台湾进行猖狂的战争侵略活动后，今天离开台湾。按照福建前线司令部打炮“迎送”的命令，我日夜守卫在各炮位旁边的英雄炮兵勇士和英雄民兵们，在今晨六时整，同时开炮。英雄们激愤地高呼：“送瘟神，开炮！”一时间，“艾森豪威尔滚蛋！”“坚决解放祖国领土台、澎、金、马！”“坚决支持亚洲各国人民反对艾森豪威尔强盗旅行的正义斗争！”“坚决和美帝国主义斗争到底！”的怒吼声和隆隆炮声，震撼着黎明的台湾海峡。
    送“瘟神”的示威大炮，一直怒轰到艾森豪威尔滚离台湾。
