The fate of Japan is determined by the Japanese people.
American imperialism will inevitably be driven out of Japan.
Beijing Municipal Student Federation Sends a Telegram to Student Organizations in Tokyo, Japan

(Reported by this newspaper) The Beijing Municipal Student Federation sent a telegram on the 10th to the Tokyo Student Autonomous Association Liaison Council in Japan, supporting the anti-American patriotic struggle of students across Japan and in Tokyo.

The full text of the telegram is as follows:
To the Tokyo Student Autonomous Association Liaison Council, dear Japanese comrades:

We, on behalf of all students in Beijing, extend our highest respect and firm support to all Japanese students and students in Tokyo who are launching an even more powerful struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, against the traitorous Kishi Nobusuke clique, and against the visit to Japan by the top U.S. imperialist warmonger Eisenhower.

U.S. imperialism, the most vicious enemy of the people of the world, is directing the reactionary Kishi Nobusuke clique to use fascist violence to illegally and forcibly "pass" the aggressive Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. This does not demonstrate the strength of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, but only shows that they have fallen into a dead end in the face of the powerful struggle of the people.

U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the people of China and Japan. Opposing U.S. imperialist aggression and war policies and opposing the revival of Japanese militarism is the common task of students and people of China and Japan. The anti-American patriotic and just struggle of Japanese students and people against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty has severely打击了the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression in the Far East and greatly encouraged the struggle of the people of all countries against U.S. imperialism. We firmly believe that as long as Japanese students and the Japanese people strengthen their unity, persevere, and fight to the end, they will surely be able to crush the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and will surely be able to drive U.S. imperialism out of Japan. The fate of Japan is determined by the Japanese people, not by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries.

Dear comrades! Unity is strength, and struggle is victory. We wish you more glorious and greater victories in this glorious and great struggle.

Beijing Municipal Student Federation

    决定日本命运的是日本人民
    美帝国主义必将被赶出日本
    北京市学联致电日本东京都学生组织
    本报讯　北京市学生联合会10日致电日本东京都学生自治会连络会议，支持全日本学生和日本东京都学生的反美爱国斗争。
    电报全文如下：日本东京都学生自治会连络会议亲爱的日本同学们：
    我们代表全北京市学生，向为反对日美军事同盟条约、反对岸信介卖国集团、反对美帝国主义头号战争贩子艾森豪威尔访问日本而展开更加强大的斗争的全日本学生和日本东京都学生致崇高的敬意和坚决的支持。
    全世界人民最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义，指使岸信介反动集团施用法西斯暴力非法地强行“通过”侵略性的日美军事同盟条约，这决不表现美日反动派的强大，而只是表现它在人民强大的斗争面前已经陷于日暮途穷的困境。
    美帝国主义是中日两国人民的共同敌人。反对美帝国主义侵略和战争政策、反对日本军国主义复活是中日两国学生和人民的共同任务。日本学生和人民反对日美军事同盟条约的反美爱国正义斗争严重地打击了美帝国主义在远东的侵略政策，大大地鼓舞了各国人民反对美帝国主义的斗争。我们坚信，日本学生和日本人民只要加强团结，再接再厉，斗争到底，就一定能够粉碎日美军事同盟条约，就一定能够把美帝国主义从日本赶出去。决定日本命运的是日本人民，绝不是美日反动派。
    亲爱的同学们！团结就是力量，斗争就是胜利。祝你们在这一光荣而伟大的斗争中，获得更光辉、更伟大的胜利。
    北京市学生联合会
