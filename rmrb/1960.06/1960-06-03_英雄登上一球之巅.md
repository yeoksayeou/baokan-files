How did the three Chinese mountaineering heroes overcome numerous natural obstacles and climb from the north slope to the world's highest peak, Mount Everest, which foreign mountaineering explorers call "impossible for even birds to cross"?

At the Chinese mountaineering team's base camp at an altitude of 5,120 meters below Mount Everest, I interviewed the three brave mountaineering heroes who had just returned triumphantly: Master of Sports Wang Fuzhou, Master of Sports Qu Yinhua, and First-Class Athlete Gongbu. They enthusiastically recounted their fierce battle to conquer the summit of Mount Everest.

The Battle Begins

On May 17th, led by Deputy Captain and Master of Sports Xu Jing, the members of the Chinese mountaineering team set off from the base camp at the foot of the mountain, beginning their fourth march to conquer Mount Everest—the battle to seize the summit.

After seven days of arduous marching, on May 23rd, Xu Jing and thirteen mountaineering team members reached a snow slope at an altitude of 8,500 meters on Mount Everest, where they established the eighth and final high-altitude camp—the "assault camp"—on the north slope of Mount Everest.

That night at 10:00 p.m. they saw the weather forecast signal flare "Good weather on the 24th" sent from the third camp at an altitude of 6,400 meters. This news increased the team members' confidence in conquering the summit.

At 9:30 a.m. Beijing time on May 24th, Wang Fuzhou, leading Qu Yinhua, Gongbu, and Master of Sports Liu Lianman, carrying high-altitude backpacks and holding ice axes, began their ascent towards the summit of Mount Everest. Deputy Captain Xu Jing remained at the "assault camp," commanding the battle to seize the summit, while the other team members retreated to the sixth high-altitude camp at an altitude of 8,100 meters, preparing to provide necessary support.

The Final Obstacle—The Second Step

The team members assaulting the summit traveled for about two hours, ascending only about seventy meters. They then arrived at the famous "Second Step" on the north slope of Mount Everest. The "Second Step" was like a city wall, blocking their path. This was a steep cliff and precipice, located between 8,570 and 8,600 meters above sea level, with a relative height of about thirty meters. The rock face was steep and smooth, with an average slope of about sixty to seventy degrees, making it almost impossible to find any points of support for climbing. According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, the famous British mountaineers Mallory and Irvine lost their lives in this area in 1924. The British "expedition" later concluded that the "Second Step" was a major obstacle, and it was no longer worth wasting time climbing it.

The Chinese mountaineering team members attacking the summit had tried to bypass the "Second Step" and ascend to the summit along the northeast ridge, but the ridge area was even steeper and more difficult to traverse. Therefore, they spiraled forward in a direction parallel to the "Second Step," finally finding a longitudinal rock crevice in the middle layer of the "Second Step." Wang Fuzhou, Liu Lianman, Qu Yinhua, and Gongbu discussed the situation and decided to climb the "Second Step" along this crevice.

Wisdom and Courage Conquer Difficulties

Braving the severe cold of minus thirty degrees Celsius, they advanced on the steep and slippery rock face. Even wearing specially made high-altitude boots with steel studs, it was difficult for them to keep their footing. Master of Sports Qu Yinhua, who was opening the way in front, slipped several times, but this Communist Party member from a logging worker's family in the Sichuan forest area gritted his teeth and persisted in moving forward.

When approaching the top of the "Second Step," at the last three meters or so, the rock face became vertical and smooth. Master of Sports Liu Lianman went to the front to open the way. He inserted his hands into the rock crevices and stepped on the rock face with his toes, using all his strength to ascend inch by inch, but if his body tilted slightly, he would fall back to where he started. Liu Lianman climbed four times and fell four times, leaving him feeling sore all over.

People stopped to think of a solution. At this time, Liu Lianman, a firefighter from Harbin, smiled and decided to use the "human ladder" method, squatting at the bottom of the rock crevice and letting his comrades step on his shoulders as a support point, and then slowly using his strength to stand up, allowing them to climb upward. At this altitude, any small movement would cause a serious reaction in the body. Liu Lianman's eyes were seeing "golden stars," his legs were trembling, and his breathing became heavy. However, this excellent Communist Party member persisted. He first lifted Qu Yinhua up. Then he lifted Gongbu up. Finally, Qu and Gong pulled Wang Fuzhou and Liu Lianman up.

Reaching the top of the "Second Step," they realized that due to the reduction in their physical strength, climbing the entire "Second Step" had taken them more than five hours, and climbing the final three meters or so had taken them three hours.

Party Group Meeting

Because the speed of advance was slow, the sky had already begun to darken. In the evening, the sun was already setting, and the cold wind howled fiercely. The brave mountaineering team members were still moving forward. However, because of the time and energy spent in the previous stage, the pressure gauges on the oxygen cylinders on their backs indicated that the oxygen capacity was low, and continuing to move forward might be threatened by hypoxia. At this time, Liu Lianman was extremely weak due to excessive fatigue, and he would fall involuntarily every one or two steps, but he slowly stood up and continued to move forward.

When the four of them reached an altitude of 8,700 meters, there was even less oxygen, and Liu Lianman's movements became even more difficult. At this time, Wang Fuzhou, Qu Yinhua, and Liu Lianman, these three members of the Chinese Communist Party, immediately stopped and held a Party group meeting on this slope, which is known in the Western mountaineering world as the "death zone."

Wang Fuzhou—this graduate of the geological institute—said excitedly: "Climbing to the summit is a task assigned to us by the Party. We must move forward even without oxygen!"

Qu Yinhua, who had developed a stubborn personality from logging in the plateau forests since childhood, said: "If we retreat now, what face will I, as a Communist Party member, have to go back and see the Party?"

Liu Lianman also firmly stated: "We can't leave, we have to crawl up!"

Considering Liu Lianman's physical condition, and in order to save time, the Party group meeting decided that Liu Lianman should stay behind, and the remaining three would advance towards the summit as quickly as possible.

The True Qualities of a Communist Party Member

After Wang Fuzhou, Qu Yinhua, and Gongbu continued to advance towards the summit, Liu Lianman leaned against a large wind-sheltered rock and was in a semi-conscious state. He subconsciously picked up his oxygen cylinder, saw that there were still dozens of liters of oxygen left inside, put on his mask and took a few breaths. A warm current flowed through his body, and his mind became clear. At this time, he thought of the three comrades who were fighting for the summit, and he decided that even if he endured severe hypoxia and fatigue, he would leave this last bit of oxygen for his comrades to use when they returned. Therefore, he resolutely and quickly closed the switch on the oxygen cylinder. He then wrote a short letter in his diary and fell into a deep sleep. He wrote in the letter: I see that there is still some oxygen in the oxygen cylinder, use it when the three of you come back, it may be useful.

At the same time, Wang Fuzhou, Qu Yinhua, and Gongbu were moving forward with difficulty in the vast night.

The Final Battle

The three of them continued to advance along the snow slope, which became steeper and more slippery, so they changed course and detoured to the rocky slope in the northeast direction to attack the main peak. After they climbed over two rocky slopes with gradients of more than sixty degrees, they began to climb a steep slope. Tibetan team member Gongbu was opening the way in front, but he was too tired to continue in a few minutes. Therefore, Qu Yinhua stepped forward to open the way. He advanced only two or three steps after a long time, but his legs weakened and he slid back to where he started. Finally, Wang Fuzhou was replaced to walk in front, and he persevered in creating a path forward for everyone.

The night was heavy, and the mountains of Mount Everest were hazy, with only the vague outline of the summit of Mount Everest visible. In order to avoid accidents during the night march, Wang Fuzhou, Qu Yinhua, and Gongbu all lay prostrate on the ground, relying on the faint reflection of the snow on the ground to identify the route forward.

The night deepened, and it was pitch black under the mountain in the distance, with twinkling stars shining in the sky. The black shadow of the summit of Mount Everest appeared lower and lower in front of them.

Arriving at an altitude of about 8,830 meters, Wang Fuzhou, Qu Yinhua, and Gongbu had used up all their oxygen. At that time, the wind gradually subsided, which was very beneficial for climbing to the summit. They stood silently on the rocky slope for a moment. Wang Fuzhou was the first to speak: "Comrades, the three of us are now responsible for the task of conquering the main peak. We have no oxygen. Although continuing to move forward may be dangerous, can we retreat?"

Qu Yinhua and Gongbu replied in unison: "Continue to move forward!"

They discarded the empty oxygen cylinders on their backs to reduce their burden, and began a difficult and dangerous journey that had never been undertaken in human history.

Now, they had to stop and rest for a long time after each step forward. Severe hypoxia at high altitude made them feel headaches, dizziness, shortness of breath, and weakness. Their movements became more difficult, and it even took them half an hour to climb over a rock one meter high. They endured all this, helping each other and encouraging each other to move forward.

Perseverance is Victory

After crossing a rocky slope dotted with white snow, Wang Fuzhou, Qu Yinhua, and Gongbu finally reached a place where rock and snow met. Looking around, in the hazy night, the black shadows of the peaks in the Mount Everest area all lay prostrate at their feet. Now, they could no longer find any rocks above them that they could climb. They had finally reached the summit of Mount Everest, completing the unprecedented feat in human history of climbing the world's highest peak from the north.

At this time, the hands of the luminous watch were pointing to 4:20 a.m. Beijing time, which was already the time before dawn on May 25th.

The south side of Mount Everest was covered with white snow, and the north side was gray rock. In an oval-shaped area where snow and gray rock meet, this is the summit of Mount Everest, which is mysterious and longed for by mountaineers from all over the world.

After nearly nineteen hours of fighting, the brave mountaineering heroes Wang Fuzhou, Qu Yinhua, and Gongbu were extremely exhausted, but the joy of victory made them so excited and moved.

An Unforgettable Quarter of an Hour

Tibetan team member Gongbu took out from his backpack a five-star red flag and a small white plaster bust of Chairman Mao that the mountaineering team had entrusted them to take to the summit, placed them on a large rock on the northwest side of the summit, and then protected them with small stones.

At this time, Wang Fuzhou groped in the dark and took out a "sports diary" notebook and wrote on it with a black mechanical pencil: "Wang Fuzhou and two others conquered Mount Everest. 4:20 a.m. on May 25, 1960"

Because it was dark and he couldn't see clearly, and his hands were frozen stiff by the cold, it took Wang Fuzhou about three minutes to write this line of words crookedly.

Gongbu came over and helped him tear off this commemorative piece of paper, put it in a white woolen glove, and then buried it in a pile of small stones.

In order to commemorate the victory of reaching the summit, they picked up nine rock specimens, intending to bring them back to Chairman Mao.

They stayed on the summit for about a quarter of an hour. After 4:35 a.m. Beijing time, they began to descend the mountain. It was unprecedented in the history of world mountaineering to not use artificial oxygen at an altitude of 8,882 meters.

Because it was dark, although the three of them carried a movie camera, they were unable to film the scene at the summit. It was only after they descended the mountain and it became light that they filmed some footage back to the summit from a place at an altitude of 8,700 meters.

Selfless Class Friendship

Liu Lianman, who stayed at an altitude of 8,700 meters, woke up and found footprints left on the snow slope leading to the summit. He knew that Wang Fuzhou and the other two had reached the summit. A surge of energy made him stand up. When he saw Wang Fuzhou and the other two returning safely, the first thing he did was to let them inhale the last dozens of liters of artificial oxygen that he had left behind at the risk of his life. When he handed the oxygen cylinder to Wang Fuzhou and the other two to use, they were all moved to tears.

These four brave mountaineering team members reunited and happily walked down the mountain. Their victorious news quickly spread down the mountain, to the base camp, to the whole country, and to the whole world. People cheered and jumped, feeling incomparably glorious and proud of the great achievements made by our excellent mountaineers.

At 1:30 p.m. Beijing time on May 30th, all four of them, together with all the mountaineering team members, returned safely to the mountaineering team's base camp at an altitude of 5,120 meters below the mountain.

From going up the mountain on May 17th to arriving at the base camp below the mountain on May 30th, they lived on the world's highest peak for two weeks.

    英雄登上一球之巅
    新华社记者　郭超人
    我国三名登山英雄是怎样战胜重重天险，从北坡登上了被外国登山探险家称为“飞鸟也无法越过”的世界第一高峰——珠穆朗玛峰的呢？
    记者在珠穆朗玛峰下拔海五千一百二十米的中国登山队大本营访问了刚刚凯旋归来的这三名勇敢的登山英雄——运动健将王富洲、运动健将屈银华和一级运动员贡布，他们热情洋溢地向记者叙述了他们这场激烈的夺取珠穆朗玛峰顶峰的战斗。
    战斗开始了
    5月17日，中国登山队的队员们在副队长、运动健将许竞率领下，从山下大本营出发，开始了征服珠穆朗玛峰的第四次行军——夺取顶峰的战斗。
    经过七天艰苦的行军，5月23日，许竞和十三名登山队员登上了珠穆朗玛峰拔海八千五百米的地方，在这里的一处雪坡上建立了珠穆朗玛峰北坡上的第八号，即最后一座高山营地——“突击营地”。
    当天晚上十点钟，他们看到了设在拔海六千四百米第三号营地发出的气象预报信号弹“24日为好天气”。这个消息给队员们增加了征服顶峰的信心。
    5月24日清晨北京时间九点半，由王富洲率领屈银华、贡布和运动健将刘连满四个人，背着高山背包，扶着冰镐，开始向珠穆朗玛峰顶峰进发。副队长许竞留在“突击营地”，指挥这场攻夺顶峰的战斗，其他队员撤回到拔海八千一百米的第六号高山营地，准备进行必要的支援。
    最后的障碍——第二台阶
    突击顶峰的队员们走了大约两个钟头，才上升了约七十米。这时他们来到了珠穆朗玛峰北坡上著名的“第二台阶”下。“第二台阶”就像城墙一样，拦阻着他们的去路。这是一道陡峭的悬岩绝壁，座落在拔海八千五百七十米到八千六百米之间，相对高度约三十米左右，岩壁陡峭而光滑，平均坡度在六、七十度左右，几乎找不到任何便于攀援的支撑点。据大英百科全书记载，1924年英国登山界赫赫有名的登山家马洛里和欧文，就曾在这一带丧失了生命。英国“探险队”后来对“第二台阶”作出结论说：这是一个很大的障碍，再也不必浪费时间去爬它了。
    突击顶峰的中国登山队队员们曾经试图绕过“第二台阶”，沿东北山脊登上顶峰，但是山脊地带更是陡峭，更难行走，于是，他们沿着与“第二台阶”平行的方向盘旋前进，最后在“第二台阶”中层地带找到了一道纵形岩石裂缝。王富洲、刘连满、屈银华和贡布商量了一下，决定沿这条裂缝登上“第二台阶”。
    智勇克难关
    他们冒着摄氏零下三十多度的严寒，在陡滑的岩壁上前进，他们穿着特制的镶有钢钉的高山靴，也很难使脚步踩稳。走在前面开路的运动健将屈银华，一连滑落好几次，但这位来自四川林区工人出身的共产党员咬着牙，坚持前进。
    在接近“第二台阶”顶部最后约三米的地方时，岩壁变得垂直而光滑。运动健将刘连满走到前面开路，他用双手伸进岩缝，脚尖蹬着岩面，使出全身力量一寸一寸地上升，但是身体稍为一歪，便又跌落到原来的地方。刘连满一连攀登了四次，跌落四次，弄得全身酸软。
    人们停下来想办法。这时，来自哈尔滨的消防员刘连满笑了笑，就决定采用搭“人梯”的办法，蹲在岩缝底下，让战友们踏着他的双肩，当作支撑点，再慢慢用力站起来，让他们向上攀登。在这样的高度上作任何一个细小的动作，都会给身体带来严重的反应。刘连满的眼睛里冒着“金花”，两腿颤抖，呼吸也变得沉重。但是，这个优秀的共产党员一直坚持着。他先把屈银华托了上去。然后又托贡布。最后屈、贡在上面再把王富洲和刘连满拉上去。
    登上“第二台阶”的岩顶，他们才发觉，由于体力减弱，他们攀登整个“第二台阶”，竟使他们花费了五个多小时的时间，而攀登这最后的约三米的高度，他们竟用了三个小时的时间。
    党小组会
    因为前进速度缓慢，天色已开始晚下来。傍晚，太阳已经偏西，寒风凄厉地呼啸。勇敢的登山队员们还在向前挺进。但是，由于在前一阶段花费的时间和体力过多，他们背上氧气筒上的气压表指示，氧气的容量已经不多，继续前进可能会受到缺氧的威胁。这时，刘连满因为过度疲劳，体力已经非常衰弱，每走一、两步就会不自觉地摔倒，但他缓慢地站起来仍然继续往前走着。
    当他们四人来到拔海八千七百米的高度时，氧气更少了，刘连满的行动也更加艰难。这时，王富洲、屈银华和刘连满这三名中国共产党党员立即停下来，就在这被西方登山界称作“死亡地带”的山坡上，举行了党的小组会。
    王富洲——这个地质学院的毕业生激动地说：“登上顶峰是党交给我们的任务，没有氧也要前进！”
    从小在高原森林里伐木养成一副倔强性格的屈银华说：“如果现在就后退，我这个共产党员有什么脸回去见党呢？”
    刘连满也坚决表示：“不能走，爬也要爬上去！”
    考虑到刘连满的身体，同时为了争取时间，党小组会决定刘连满留下来，其余三人以尽快的速度向顶峰挺进。
    共产党员的本色
    当王富洲、屈银华和贡布继续向顶峰前进以后，刘连满靠在一块避风的大石头旁边，已经处于半昏迷状态。他下意识地拿起自己的氧气筒，看里面还剩下几十公升氧气，便套上面罩吸了几口，一股暖流流遍了全身，他的头脑变得清醒了。这时，他想起了正在与顶峰搏斗的三位战友，他决定哪怕自己忍受着严重缺氧和疲劳的袭击，这最后一点氧气也要留给战友们回来时使用。于是，他便毅然地连忙关紧了氧气筒的开关。并且在日记本上写下了一封短信，然后就昏沉地睡去，他在信中写道：我看氧气筒里还有点氧，给你们三个人回来时用吧，估计也许管用。
    与此同时，王富洲、屈银华和贡布，正在苍茫的夜色中艰难地向前行进。
    最后的战斗
    他们三人沿雪坡继续前进，愈走愈陡愈滑，因而改道绕到东北方向的岩石坡向主峰突击。他们翻过两座坡度在六十度以上的岩石坡以后，开始攀登一座峭坡。藏族队员贡布在前面开路，不到几分钟就累得不行。于是，屈银华上前开路，他经过很长的时间才前进了两三步，但两腿一软，又滑回到原来的地方。最后，又换上王富洲走到前面，他坚持着为大家开出一条前进的路线。
    夜色浓重，珠穆朗玛峰山岭间朦胧一片，只有珠穆朗玛顶峰还露出隐约的轮廓。王富洲、屈银华和贡布三人为了避免深夜行军发生意外，就都匍伏在地上，依靠地上模糊的雪光反照，辨认路途前进。
    夜深了，远处山下一片漆黑，点点星光在空中闪耀。珠穆朗玛顶峰的黑影在他们面前越加显得低矮了。
    到达八千八百三十米左右的地方，王富洲、屈银华和贡布三人的氧气已经全部用完了。当时风渐渐小了，这对攀上顶峰十分有利。他们站在岩坡上沉默了片刻。王富洲首先开口说：“同志们，我们三个人现在担负着攻克主峰的任务，氧气没有了，继续前进虽然可能发生危险，但是我们能后退吗？”
    屈银华和贡布异口同声地回答：“继续前进！”
    他们抛掉背上的空氧气筒，以减轻负重，开始了人类史上从未有过的艰难而危险的历程。
    现在，他们每前进一步，就不得不停下来休息很长的时间。由于高山严重缺氧，使他们感到头痛、眼花、气喘、无力。他们的行动更加艰难了，甚至攀过一米高的岩石，也需要半个多小时的时间。他们忍受着这一切，互相帮助，互相鼓励地前进着。
    坚持就是胜利
    在越过一片点点白雪的岩石坡以后，王富洲、屈银华和贡布终于登上了一个岩石和积雪交界的地方。举目四望，朦胧的夜色中，珠穆朗玛峰山区的群峰的一座座黑影，都匍伏在他们的脚下。现在，在他们三人的头上，再也找不到任何可以再向上攀登的山岩了。他们终于登上了珠穆朗玛峰的顶峰，完成了人类历史上从北路攀上世界最高峰的创举。
    这时，夜光表的指针正指着北京时间四时二十分，这已是5月25日黎明前的时分了。
    珠穆朗玛峰南面是一片皑皑的积雪，北面是灰色的岩石，在积雪和灰岩交界的一块椭圆形的地带，这就是神秘而为世界各国登山家所向往的珠穆朗玛峰的顶峰。
    经过了近十九个小时的搏斗，英勇的登山英雄王富洲、屈银华、贡布三人虽然已极度疲劳，但是，胜利的喜悦使他们变得那样兴奋和激动。
    难忘的一刻钟
    藏族队员贡布从背包里拿出了登山队委托他们带上顶峰的一面五星红旗和一座小型白色毛主席半身石膏像，放到顶峰西北边一块大岩石上，然后用细石保护起来。
    这时，王富洲摸着黑，拿出一本“体育日记”本，用黑色自动铅笔在上面写道：“王富洲等三人征服了珠峰。1960年5月25日四时二十分”
    因为天黑看不清楚，双手又被严寒冻僵，王富洲花了约三分钟时间才歪歪斜斜地写完了这行字句。
    贡布走过来，帮他把这张值得纪念的纸条撕下来，放在一只白色羊毛织的手套里，然后也埋进了垒垒的细石堆里。
    为了纪念登上顶峰的胜利，他们拣了九块岩石标本，准备回来带给毛主席。
    他们在山顶大约停留了一刻钟的时间。北京时间四点三十五分以后，他们开始下山。在拔海八千八百八十二米的高度不使用人造氧气，这在世界登山史上是史无前例的。
    因为天色黑暗，尽管他们三人携带了一部电影摄影机，但是却没能拍下顶峰的情景，只是在他们下山天亮以后，才在拔海八千七百米的地方往回拍摄了一些镜头。
    无私的阶级友爱
    留在拔海八千七百米的地方的刘连满一觉醒来，发现在通向顶峰的雪坡上留下了脚印，他知道王富洲等三人已经上了顶峰。一股劲就使他站了起来。当他看到王富洲等三人安全地回来时，第一句话就是让他们吸他冒着生命危险留下的最后几十公升人造氧气。当他把氧气筒交给王富洲等三人使用时，他们都感动地落下泪来。
    这四位勇敢的登山队员又汇集在一起，高兴地向山下走去。他们胜利的消息很快就传到了山下，传到了大本营，传到了全国，传到了全世界。人们欢呼着、跳跃着，为我们优秀登山运动员所取得的伟大成就感到无比的光荣和骄傲。
    5月30日北京时间十三点三十分，他们四个人和全体登山队员一道，全部安全地回到了山下拔海五千一百二十米的登山队大本营。
    从5月17日上山，到5月30日到达山下大本营，他们在世界最高峰上生活了两个星期。
