    Actors and Peasants are of One Heart
    Introducing the Wujiang County Friendly Xiju Troupe
    Our Newspaper Reporter
    The Wujiang County Friendly Xiju Troupe of Jiangsu Province, an advanced unit attending the National Congress of Heroes of Culture and Education, has for eight years, day in and day out, gone deep into the countryside, learning from the workers and peasants, and performing for the workers and peasants, taking root in the countryside and becoming a troupe loved by the broad masses of peasants. From 1956 to 1959, the troupe performed nearly three thousand shows for the entire county, with an audience of over one million people, of which the number of shows performed in the countryside accounted for more than 75%.

    In 1952, this troupe, formerly known as the "beggar troupe," was assigned to Wujiang County. The responsible comrade of the county party committee received them warmly and told them: "Wujiang is a region mainly based on agriculture. Literature and art should better serve the peasants. This is the glorious task of literary and artistic workers, and also your most beautiful future." The words of the Party clarified their direction and generated strength. When the troupe first went on a tour in the countryside, the masses of the Tongluo Cooperative rushed to make a banner with the words "Heart of Friendship" to present to them. The masses of the Yuanping Cooperative took the initiative to arrange venues, food, and accommodation for the troupe, and welcomed and sent them off with gongs and drums, affectionately calling them "our cultural troupe." These enthusiastic receptions moved the troupe leader Yao Meifeng to tears. In the old society, she led a small opera troupe performing in the countryside of Changshu County. A pseudo-district chief asked her to sing ditties in an opium den, which she refused. Soon she was labeled as "disturbing public order" and banned from performing. The actors found it difficult to make a living and were forced to disband. The contrast between the past and the present made the actors deeply feel the glory and great responsibility of being people's actors. For eight years, they have performed for the peasants happily and diligently. Sometimes, in order to catch up with the performance time, the actors brought their own props and scenery, and carried their bedding and clothes, walking dozens of miles in one breath. In winter, they always chose a place facing the northwest wind to set up the stage so that the audience could watch the show with their backs to the wind. Once, they were performing "Liu Hulan." Suddenly, a cold wind swept through. Yao Meifeng, who played Liu Hulan, saw that the audience was reluctant to leave, and thinking of Liu Hulan's great spirit, she insisted on performing to the end.

    When this troupe first went to the countryside, some actors were ideologically blocked. They were physically in the countryside, but their hearts were in the city. Some even opposed going to the countryside, using excuses such as "peasants don't understand opera" or "peasants are busy with farming and have no time to watch opera." Under the leadership of the Party, the troupe repeatedly studied the Party's literary and artistic policies and launched debates on issues such as "whether to serve the workers and peasants" and "how to serve the workers and peasants." Through a series of educational methods, such as recalling the past and settling accounts, moving exhibitions, talking about changes, making comparisons, and pointing out directions, they made some actors realize their wrong ideas. They said: "We have changed from 'beggar actors' to 'engineers of the human soul.' If we don't listen to the Party's words again, we will be letting down the Party and the people." "In the past, performing was for survival. Today, performing is for socialist construction. We resolutely will not perform plays that are harmful to the people." In this way, the troupe resisted the evil winds and established a righteous atmosphere. In eight years, they have not performed a single bad play. Because they have served the people diligently and conscientiously, they have established a deep relationship with the peasants. Wherever there is a need, they immediately go there. Last Spring Festival, they were doing commercial performances in the county seat, when the Yuanping Commune sent a letter, earnestly hoping that they would go to perform. They were willing to reduce their income to perform for the peasants. They said, "Our friendship with the peasant brothers is priceless."

    "Innovate and perform new plays, a hundred flowers bloom, every flower is for production" is the troupe's performance policy that they have long adhered to after putting politics in command. They have basically achieved that whatever the central work of the Party is, they will compose and perform plays about it. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, they created more than a dozen plays in a short period of time, such as "Leap Forward for Whom," "Happy Event," "Steel Flower," and "The People's Commune is Good." These plays reflecting reality gave the peasants great encouragement. They said, "In the past, watching plays about young masters and ladies made us confused; now, watching plays about heroes makes us full of energy." When Lilli Commune was building water conservancy projects, it put forward the slogan "Happily watch Xiju, enthusiastically engage in production." The task that originally took three days to complete was completed in two days. (Attached picture)

    演员同农民兄弟心连心
    介绍吴江县友好锡剧团
    本报记者
    出席全国文教群英会先进单位江苏省吴江县友好锡剧团，八年如一日，深入农村，向工农学习，为工农演出，在农村扎下了根子，成为广大农民喜爱的剧团。1956年到1959年，这个剧团为全县演出近三千场，观众达一百多万人次，其中在农村演出的场数占75％以上。
    1952年，这个过去被人们叫惯了的“叫化子剧团”分配到吴江县。县委负责同志亲切地接待他们，并告诉他们：“吴江是一个以农业为主的地区，文艺应该更好地为农民服务，这是文艺工作者的光荣任务，也是你们最美好的前途。”党的话使他们明确了方向，产生了力量。剧团第一次在农村巡回演出时，铜锣社群众连夜赶制一面“友谊的心”的锦旗送给他们；苑坪社的群众主动为剧团安排场地，饮食，住地，还敲锣打鼓迎送他们，亲热地称呼他们是“我们的文工团”。这些热情的接待，使团长姚梅凤感动得流下了眼泪。在旧社会，她带着一个小戏班在常熟县乡下演出。有个伪区长要她到鸦片馆唱小调，她拒绝了。不久她被扣上“捣乱治安”的帽子，禁止演出。演员们难以生活，被迫散班拆伙。今昔对比，使演员们深感做为人民演员的光荣和责任重大。八年以来，他们愉快紧张地为农民演出。有时为了赶上演出时间，演员们自带道具、布景，背了被褥、衣服，一口气走几十里。冬天，他们总是选择面向西北风的地方搭台，使观众能背风看戏。有一次，他们演出“刘胡兰”，突然冷风袭来，扮演刘胡兰的姚梅凤看到观众舍不得离开，又想想刘胡兰的伟大精神，便坚持演出到底。
    这个剧团刚下乡时，有些演员思想不通。人在农村，心在城市，甚至借口“农民不懂戏”、“农忙，农民没有空看戏”，反对下乡。剧团在党的领导下，反复学习了党的文艺方针，开展了“要不要为工农服务”和“如何为工农服务”等问题的辩论，他们通过回忆算账、搬展览、谈变化、讲对比、指方向等一系列的教育方法，使部分演员认识了自己的错误思想。他们说：“我们从‘戏化子’变成了‘人类灵魂工程师’，再不听党的话，真是对不起党和人民。”“过去演戏是为活命，今天演戏是为社会主义建设，我们坚决不演对人民有害的戏。”就这样，剧团顶住了歪风，树立了正气。八年中没有演过一出坏戏。由于他们勤勤恳恳地为人民服务，因而与农民建立了深厚的感情，只要哪里需要就立即到哪里去。去年春节，他们在县城里做营业演出，这时苑坪公社来信，殷切地希望他们去演出。他们情愿减少收入，去为农民演戏。他们说：“我们和农民兄弟心连心的友谊是无法用金钱来换取的。”
    “创新演新百花开，朵朵鲜花为生产”是这个剧团政治挂帅以后，长期坚持的演出方针。他们基本上做到了党的中心工作是什么，就编什么，演什么。1958年大跃进，他们短期创作了“跃进为谁”、“喜事”、“钢铁之花”、“人民公社好”等十几个剧目。这些反映现实的戏，给了农民很大鼓舞，他们说：“过去看公子小姐，迷迷糊糊；现在看英雄好汉，干劲十足。”黎里公社在兴修水利时，提出“高高兴兴看锡剧，轰轰烈烈搞生产”的行动口号。原来要三天完成的任务，两天就完成了。（附图片）
