Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu. Sichuan Province is widely carrying out mass seed selection and retention movements during the summer harvest in order to lay a good foundation for an even greater wheat harvest next year. Nanchong Prefecture, which is progressing relatively quickly, had selected 61,050,000 jin of fine wheat, bean, and rapeseed seeds by mid-May.

This year, seed selection and retention work in various parts of Sichuan has been grasped early and meticulously. As early as the spring sowing, various localities formulated breeding, seed selection, and seed retention plans, and established organizations at all levels to strengthen leadership over seed selection and retention work. Jiang'an County established 33 seed propagation farms and more than 40 breeding work teams. During the heading and flowering season of crops, a general field survey was conducted to plan for more than 30,000 mu of seed base, and special personnel were assigned to contract by area to systematically manage them, ensuring that the seeds are large, full, and free of disease and insects. After the start of the summer harvest, various localities adopted a combination of professional team seed selection and mass appraisal to select and retain seeds plot by plot and plant by plant. In Huilan District, Lezhi County, a high-yield wheat county, communes adopted methods of ear selection, removal of impurities and inferior plants, and block selection to select "Nanda 2419" and "Shannong 205" and other fine wheat seeds totaling one million jin for their own use, and plan to select another 1.5 million jin of fine wheat seeds to support other areas. Zhongxian County, a high-yield rapeseed red banner county, after carrying out the work of selecting the best from the best, reselected more than 20,000 jin of Victory rapeseed, a fine variety with denser pods and larger seeds than ordinary rapeseed, from the original 400,000 rapeseed plants that had been selected.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 31st. Hubei's rural areas are vigorously carrying out mass field seed selection and retention movements for wheat, in order to reserve sufficient fine seeds for an even greater summer harvest next year.

In recent years, Hubei Province has made great achievements in promoting the fine wheat variety "Nanda 2419," which has become popular throughout the province. However, in the past two years, variety mixing has occurred in many areas, with a mixing rate of about 25% in some areas. Therefore, various counties have paid great attention to seed selection this year, and many counties have fixed special labor forces and leadership teams to be responsible for seed selection. Xinzhou County established seed selection institutions at all levels, adopted the method of "starting early, assigning special personnel, selecting seeds comprehensively, and managing while selecting," and organized more than 12,000 experienced commune members to participate in seed selection activities. Hong'an, Qichun, and other counties, based on past experience, vigorously promoted "Seed Selection Day," with production teams concentrating a large number of laborers in one or several days to complete the seed selection task. Recently, Qichun County, during the Seed Selection Day, concentrated 60,000 people to block-select more than 200,000 mu of wheat and ear-select more than 600,000 jin of seeds, which can already meet the needs of the county's autumn planting this year.

In addition to field seed selection, based on the experience of advanced regions in the past, various localities have also established a number of fine seed farms this year, becoming bases for breeding fine seeds. According to preliminary statistics, more than 10,000 fine seed farms have been established throughout the province, covering a total area of about 1.1 million mu.

    四川湖北结合夏收选留良种
    据新华社成都讯　四川省各地在夏收中，广泛开展群众性的选种、留种运动，以便为明年小麦更大丰收打好基础。进度较快的南充专区，到5月中旬止，全区已选出六千一百零五万斤小麦、豆类和油菜良种。
    今年，四川各地的选种留种工作抓得早、抓得细。早在小春播种时，各地就制定了育种、选种、留种规划，并层层建立组织，加强对选种留种工作的领导。江安县建立了三十三个种子繁殖场和四十多个育种工作队，在作物抽穗扬花时节，通过田间普查，规划出种子基地三万多亩，并指定专人分片包干，系统地进行管理，确保种子粒大粒饱，无病无虫。夏收开始后，各地又采取专业队选种和群众鉴定相结合的办法，逐块、逐棵地选种、留种。小麦高产县——乐至县回澜区各公社采取穗选、去杂去劣和块选的办法，在大片种子地、高产路、试验田里除选出“南大二四一九”、“山农二零五”等小麦良种一百万斤自用外，还计划再选出一百五十万斤小麦良种支援外地。油菜高产红旗县的忠县，自开展优中选优的选种工作后，在原已留选的四十多万株油菜种中，再次精选出二万多斤比一般油菜荚更密、粒更大的胜利油菜良种。
    新华社武汉31日电　湖北农村大力开展群众性的小麦田间选种、留种运动，为明年夏季更大丰收备足良种。
    几年来，湖北省推广小麦良种“南大二四一九”有很大成绩，这个品种已在全省普及。但近两年来，有不少地区出现了品种混杂现象，有的地区混杂率达25％左右。因此，今年各县对选种工作都很注意，许多县并且固定了专门劳力和领导班子负责选种。新洲县层层建立了选种机构，采取“及早动手，专人负责，全面选种，边选边管”的办法，组织了一万二千多个有选种经验的社员投入选种活动。红安、蕲春等县根据过去经验，大搞“选种日”，以生产队为单位在一天或几天内集中大批劳力突击完成选种任务。最近，蕲春县在选种日内，集中六万人块选小麦二十多万亩，穗选种子六十多万斤，已可满足今年全县秋种的需要。
    除了田间选种外，根据以往先进地区的经验，今年各地还兴办了一批良种场，成为繁殖良种的基地。据初步统计，全省已办了良种场一万多处，面积共达一百一十万亩左右。
