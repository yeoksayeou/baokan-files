Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 20th. The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published a commentary today stating that Eisenhower, the chieftain of the US imperialists, the irreconcilable enemy of the Korean people, has set foot on the sacred soil of Korea, arousing new anger among the Korean people. Eisenhower must get out of South Korea immediately, along with his invading army.

The commentary stated that in order to "protect" Eisenhower, the US puppets deployed a heavily guarded network of more than 12,000 police officers on the streets of Seoul. Only military and police vehicles were allowed to drive on the streets. Many secret agents were also infiltrated among the crowds they forced out. Despite this, Eisenhower dared not take the main streets as originally planned, but sneaked into the US embassy through small alleys.

The commentary stated that Eisenhower, disregarding the people's firm opposition, hardened his heart and went to South Korea to embolden the Xu Zheng clique, which is trembling due to the people's resistance, to maintain the increasingly collapsing foundation of US colonial rule, and to continue to use South Korea as a springboard for aggression in Asia. His first statement at Kimpo Airport clearly revealed this point. He said that he went to South Korea "to strengthen our joint efforts in supporting collective security." This is an open expression of preparing for a new war and incorporating South Korea into a military group centered on Japanese militarism, and a new provocation against the Korean people. The Korean people will never allow Eisenhower's rampant conspiracy activities.

The commentary stated that all the misfortunes and suffering of the Korean people are due to the "aid" that Eisenhower talks about so glibly, and due to the aggressive policies and brutal plunder pursued by the US imperialist aggressors in South Korea.

The commentary stated that Eisenhower's hypocrisy and masks cannot deceive the Korean people, and can only inspire the people to fight against him and his running dogs. The South Korean people must expose and smash the conspiracy of the chieftain of the aggressors, and further launch a struggle to drive out the US troops and abolish colonial rule. This is the only way to truly obtain freedom, democracy, and the right to survival.

### 朝鲜“劳动新闻”斥艾森豪威尔的阴谋活动  号召南朝鲜人民把美军赶出去

    朝鲜“劳动新闻”斥艾森豪威尔的阴谋活动
    号召南朝鲜人民把美军赶出去
    新华社平壤20日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表评论说，朝鲜人民不共戴天的敌人——美帝国主义的头子艾森豪威尔踏上神圣的朝鲜的土地，激起了朝鲜人民新的愤怒，艾森豪威尔必须连同他的侵略军一起立即从南朝鲜滚出去。
    评论说，美国的傀儡们为了“保护”艾森豪威尔，在汉城街头布下了一万二千多名警察的森严的警戒网。街道上只有军用车辆和警察车辆能行驶。在被他们逼出来的群众中还渗入了许多特务分子。尽管这样，艾森豪威尔还是不敢按原订计划走大街，而是从小胡同溜进美国大使馆。
    评论说，艾森豪威尔不顾人民的坚决的反对，硬着头皮到南朝鲜，是为了给由于人民的反抗而发抖的许政集团打气，维持日益崩溃的美国的殖民统治基础，继续把南朝鲜当做侵略亚洲的跳板。他在金浦机场发表的第一个声明就清楚地暴露了这一点。他说，他到南朝鲜去“为的是加强我们在支持集体安全方面进行的共同努力”。这是为了准备新战争，要把南朝鲜纳入以日本军国主义为中心的军事集团的公开的表示，是对朝鲜人民的新的挑衅。朝鲜人民绝不能容许艾森豪威尔的猖狂的阴谋活动。
    评论说，朝鲜人民的一切不幸和痛苦就是由于艾森豪威尔口口声声说的“援助”，由于美帝国主义侵略者在南朝鲜推行的侵略政策和残酷的掠夺。
    评论说，艾森豪威尔的任何伪善和假面具都欺骗不了朝鲜人民，只能激发人民反对他和他的走狗的斗争。南朝鲜人民必须揭露和粉碎侵略者头子的阴谋，进一步展开赶走美军、废除殖民统治的斗争，这才是真正获得自由、民主和生存权利的道路。
