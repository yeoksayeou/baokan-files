The Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty is surging higher with each wave. The 16th National Unified Action has just ended, and the 17th National Unified Action was launched across Japan on May 31st. The "National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty," composed of 140 political parties and mass organizations in Japan, has decided that the specific goals of this action are to force Nobusuke Kishi to dissolve the Diet and to force Nobusuke Kishi to resign, effectively achieving the aim of abolishing the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. In this unified action, on the one hand, organized strikes and demonstrations are being developed, and the movement is being pushed to a new climax with a general strike scheduled for the 4th; on the other hand, a signature campaign to gather 27 million signatures is being rapidly launched nationwide to encourage people who have not yet been organized to participate in various forms of action, in order to further strengthen the struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. In addition, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan is planning to mobilize 300,000 people to hold an unprecedented demonstration march to the Diet around June 10th, based on the high tide of the strength struggle on June 4th. At present, the broad masses of the Japanese people are making great efforts for the further development of the movement. On the second day of the start of this action, the Japan Socialist Party announced that it would take the emergency measure of resigning all its Diet members to force the Kishi Nobusuke government to dissolve the Diet, showing its determination not to compromise with Kishi Nobusuke. Undoubtedly, all this will give the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries, who are trying every means to illegally establish the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, an even heavier blow following the 16th Unified Action.

The 16th Unified Action, which began on May 9th, has left a glorious page in the history of the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and for independence, peace, democracy, and neutrality. This unified action, in which a total of 20 million people participated in various ways such as strikes, rallies, demonstrations, and marches, was described by the Japanese Kyodo News as "the largest and most extraordinary tremor" since the start of the national unified action against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. The breadth of the strata it mobilized, the indignant and impassioned emotions of the masses, and the clarity of the anti-American slogans made the American propaganda machine exclaim that it "reached a terrible degree." Due to the Kishi Nobusuke government's illegal and forcible "passage" of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, the unanimous anger of the Japanese nation was aroused, and the Japanese people's awareness was greatly enhanced. People have further developed the struggle against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" into a powerful movement to force Kishi Nobusuke to dissolve the Diet and force Kishi Nobusuke to step down, thereby crushing the treaty. In addition, the Japanese people have come to a clearer understanding of the aggressive nature of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty through the U.S. U-2 spy plane's violation of Soviet airspace, the U.S.'s sabotage of the Four-Power Summit, and especially the U.S.'s support for the Kishi Nobusuke group, and anti-American sentiment has become even higher.

The continuous rise of the Japanese people's anti-American and anti-Kishi struggle has made the U.S. imperialists' running dog, the Kishi Nobusuke group, increasingly trapped in a dilemma. Following the Japan Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and the Independent Club's expression of refusal to participate in the House of Councillors' deliberation of the new "Security Treaty," on May 30th, the "House of Councillors Compatriots Association" also decided not to participate in any deliberations in the House of Councillors in the future. The contradictions within the Liberal Democratic Party continue to develop, and anti-Kishi faction leaders within the Liberal Democratic Party, Tanzan Ishibashi, Takeo Miki, Kenzo Matsumura, and Ichiro Kono, are still demanding that the discredited Nobusuke Kishi resign to take responsibility. Kishi Nobusuke is having a very hard time. As the United Press International admitted: "Today, outside the Japanese government, it is not easy to find anyone who can say a good word for Kishi (Nobusuke)." The spokesmen of U.S. imperialism are extremely worried that its aggressive plans in the Far East will be frustrated. A commentator for "The New York Times" wrote worriedly, "The fruits of our (U.S.) military diplomacy are showing new signs of poor harvest in Japan." This newspaper's commentator, Sulzberger, said, "If the facts prove that Kishi Nobusuke cannot withstand the increasing pressure, our (U.S.) position will undoubtedly be damaged."

The Kishi Nobusuke group is now doing everything in its power to make a final struggle. According to Japanese radio reports, the Kishi Nobusuke group, regardless of everything, decided on the evening of the 28th to begin "deliberation" on the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in the House of Councillors this week, and to "aim for June 15th" to "make a resolution to approve the new Security Treaty." In order to forcibly establish this aggressive military treaty, which violates the interests of the Japanese nation and endangers Asian peace, before the 19th, it will not hesitate to completely destroy the signboard of bourgeois parliamentary democracy, and is prepared to conduct separate "deliberations" even without the participation of any opposition parties; at the same time, repressive measures against the people have also begun. The Kishi Nobusuke government not only threatens to "impose severe punishments" on civil servants and teachers who are preparing to participate in the general strike, but also openly convenes meetings to plan the conspiracy to suppress the general strike.

Precisely as the Japanese people's struggle against the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" enters a new high tide, and as the Japanese reactionaries become extremely isolated and Kishi Nobusuke's position is on the verge of collapse, U.S. imperialism does not hesitate to fully expose its hideous features and does its utmost to directly promote the establishment of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. Eisenhower has already announced that he will disregard the firm opposition of the Japanese people and the protests of peace-loving people around the world, and has decided to visit Japan as scheduled. The purpose is to make the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty a fait accompli before the end of June. People see that after Syngman Rhee and Menderes were swept away one by one by the anti-imperialist wave of the Asian people, it has made U.S. imperialism increasingly urgent to support the Kishi Nobusuke traitorous group and realize the U.S.-Japan military alliance in order to continue to pursue its war policy in the Far East. Before and after visiting Japan, Eisenhower will go to South Korea, the Philippines, and also to Chiang Kai-shek's group. It must be noted that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Foreign Ministers' Meeting currently being held in Washington has regarded the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" as the "central axis of the Far East collective defense system" and listed it as the focus of discussion at this meeting. Although Japan is not yet a member of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, U.S. imperialism has long ago arranged its position in this organization: using Japan's militarist forces and economic potential to make it the core and backbone of this aggressive organization. It is very clear that after the revival of Japanese militarism, the United States is pushing Japan step by step to serve its aggressive policies and make Japan a shock force in future wars.

The Japanese reactionaries are desperately struggling and preparing to counterattack as the wave of people's struggle is surging like a tsunami. U.S. imperialism, regardless of everything, wants to impose the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" on the Japanese people, and even does not hesitate to use the dying Eisenhower as a final gamble. The Japanese people are facing a tense and fierce struggle. It should be sufficiently estimated that the Japanese people's enemies at home and abroad are very fierce. The Kishi Nobusuke group represents the part of Japanese monopoly capital that is most deeply colluded with the United States and is the most aggressive; Eisenhower represents the number one imperialist. The Japanese people know very well that to defeat such enemies, they must rely on the mobilization of the entire nation and on the struggle of thousands of "ordinary people." Especially after Kishi Nobusuke illegally and forcibly "passed" the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in the House of Representatives by violence, mobilizing the broad masses to struggle outside the parliament is of decisive significance. Japan Socialist Party Chairman Inejiro Asanuma said well: Now is not the time to hold talks with Kishi Nobusuke. "We will arouse public opinion and set off a huge high tide against him to put pressure on him." Asanuma also stated that in addition to continuing to insist on refusing to deliberate in the House of Councillors, the Socialist Party will launch a mass movement outside the Diet to force Kishi Nobusuke to resign, dissolve the Diet, and abolish the "Security Treaty." Such a decision will undoubtedly be supported by the broad masses of the Japanese people. Because when the parliament is controlled by the Japanese reactionaries and used as a tool to rape public opinion, only by resolutely launching a widespread mass struggle outside the parliament can the Kishi Nobusuke traitorous group be finally defeated. The struggle against the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" will ultimately depend on the mass struggle outside the parliament. The Japanese people's 16th Unified Action, in just three weeks, mobilized 20 million people to participate in strikes, rallies, demonstrations, and petitions. This fully reflects that the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle is rapidly expanding and deepening, turning the streets, factories, and rural areas into the main battlefields for fighting against the Japanese reactionaries. This is an important development in the struggle against the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." We firmly believe that as Kishi Nobusuke's traitorous face and Eisenhower's ferocious face are further exposed, and as the harm of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" to the Japanese nation is further revealed, the Japanese people's awareness will continue to increase, and more masses will join the struggle. The 17th Unified Action will surely unfold on a larger scale, and the collusion between Eisenhower and Kishi Nobusuke can only further stimulate the will of the broad masses of the Japanese people to resolutely fight against the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries.

The Japanese people's struggle is arduous and long-term. However, the peace-loving and justice-upholding people of the world all stand on the side of the Japanese people. In particular, the current international situation is very favorable to the Japanese people: U.S. imperialism's aggressive and war policies are opposed everywhere, and the anti-imperialist struggles of the people of all countries are flourishing. All this naturally forms a powerful support for the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic and just struggle. The Chinese people have always regarded the Japanese people's struggle as their own struggle, and have always resolutely supported it. History is created by the people, and awakened people will inevitably control their own destiny. This simple and clear truth will surely be confirmed once again by the Japanese people's struggle. We firmly believe that with the support of the people of all countries, the heroic Japanese people will certainly be able to persist in their struggle and continue to move forward.

    英勇的日本人民坚持斗争
    日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争，一浪高似一浪。第十六次全国统一行动刚刚结束，第十七次全国统一行动又于5月31日在日本全国各地展开。由日本一百四十个政党、群众团体组成的“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”决定，这次行动的具体目标是迫使岸信介解散国会和迫使岸信介辞职，实际上达到废除日美军事同盟条约的目的。在这次统一行动中，一方面发展有组织的罢工和示威，并以预定在4日举行的总罢工把运动推向新的高潮；一方面在全国范围内迅速展开征集二千七百万人的签名运动，促使还没有组织起来的人们参加各种形式的行动，以便进一步加强反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争。此外，日本工会总评议会还筹划以6月4日实力斗争的高潮为基础，在6月10日前后动员三十万人向国会举行声势空前的示威游行。目前，广大日本人民正在为运动的进一步开展作出巨大的努力。在这次行动开始的第二天，日本社会党已宣布将采取全体议员辞职的紧急措施迫使岸信介政府解散国会，表明了它绝不和岸信介妥协的决心。无疑的，这一切将继第十六次统一行动之后，给予正在千方百计地使日美军事同盟条约非法成立的美日反动派以更加沉重的打击。
    从5月9日开始举行的第十六次统一行动，已在日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约，争取独立、和平、民主、中立的斗争历史上留下了光辉的一页。共有二千万人以罢工、集会、示威、游行等各种方式参加的这次统一行动，被日本共同社称做是自从开始反对日美军事同盟条约的全国统一行动以来“最大的一次异常大震动”。它所动员的阶层之广泛、群众情绪之愤慨激昂、反美口号之鲜明，使美国的宣传机器惊呼“达到了可怕的程度”。由于岸信介政府非法强行“通过”日美军事同盟条约的暴行，激起了日本举国一致的怒潮，日本人民的觉悟大大提高。人们把反对批准新“安全条约”的斗争，进一步发展为迫使岸信介解散国会和迫使岸信介下台从而粉碎这个条约的强大运动。此外，日本人民通过美国U—2间谍飞机侵犯苏联领空事件、美国破坏四国首脑会议的行为，特别是美国对于岸信介集团的支持，更清楚地认识到日美军事同盟条约的侵略本质，反美情绪更加高涨。
    日本人民反美反岸斗争的不断高涨，使得美帝国主义的走狗岸信介集团越来越陷于窘境。继日本社会党、共产党和无党派俱乐部表示拒绝参加参议院对新“安全条约”的审议之后，5月30日，“参议院同志会”也决定今后不参加参议院的一切审议。自由民主党内部的矛盾仍在继续发展，自由民主党内反岸派领袖石桥湛山、三木武夫、松村谦三和河野一郎迄今仍要求声名狼借的岸信介引咎辞职。岸信介的日子很不好过。正像合众国际社所承认的：“今天，在日本政府外面，不容易找到任何一个为岸（信介）说一句好话的人了。”美帝国主义的代言人极为担心它在远东的侵略计划遭到挫折。“纽约时报”的评论家忧心忡忡地写道，“我们（美国）军事外交的果实在日本表现出收成不好的新迹象。”这家报纸的评论员苏兹贝格说，“如果事实证明岸信介不能够经得住越来越大的压力的话，我们（美国）的地位无疑将受到损害。”
    岸信介集团现正竭尽一切力量进行最后的挣扎。据日本电台报道，岸信介集团28日晚间不顾一切地决定要在本周内在参议院开始“审议”新日美“安全条约”，并且要“以6月15日为目标”，“作出批准新安全条约的决议”。它为了强使这项违背日本民族利益和危害亚洲和平的侵略性军事条约在19日以前非法成立，不惜彻底摧毁资产阶级议会民主的招牌，即使在没有任何反对党参加的情况下也准备进行单独“审议”；与此同时，对人民的镇压措施也已开始。岸信介政府不仅对于准备参加总罢工的公务人员和教职员工进行“给予严重处分”的威胁，并公然召集会议策划镇压总罢工的阴谋。
    恰恰在日本人民反对新日美“安全条约”的斗争进入新高潮，在日本反动派极端孤立、岸信介地位摇摇欲坠的时候，美帝国主义不惜全部露出自己的狰狞面目，拚其全力直接促使日美军事同盟条约得以成立。艾森豪威尔已经宣布，他将不顾日本全国人民的坚决反对，和全世界爱好和平人民的抗议，决定如期访问日本。目的就是在6月底前将日美军事同盟条约造成既成事实。人们看到，当李承晚、曼德列斯在亚洲人民的反帝浪潮中一个个地被冲垮以后，已使美帝国主义愈来愈迫切地要支持岸信介卖国集团、实现日美军事同盟，以便在远东继续推行战争政策。艾森豪威尔在访问日本前后，要前往南朝鲜、菲律宾，此外还要到蒋介石集团那里去。必须注意的是，目前正在华盛顿举行的东南亚条约组织外长会议，已把新日美“安全条约”看作是“远东集体防御体制的中枢”，列为这次会议的讨论中心。日本虽然还不是东南亚条约组织的成员国，但美帝国主义早已给它摆定了在这个组织中的地位：利用日本军国主义势力和经济潜力，使它成为这个侵略组织中的核心和骨干。十分清楚，在日本军国主义复活以后，美国正一步紧似一步，驱使日本为它的侵略政策服务，使日本成为未来战争中的一支突击力量。
    日本反动派在人民的斗争浪潮有如海啸般一浪高似一浪的冲击着的时候，拚命地进行挣扎和准备反扑。美帝国主义则不顾一切地要把新日美“安全条约”强加于日本人民头上，甚至不惜将风烛残年的艾森豪威尔拿来作最后的赌注。日本人民正面临着一场紧张激烈的斗争。应该足够地估计到，日本人民的国内外敌人是十分凶恶的。岸信介集团代表的是日本垄断资本当中同美国勾结最深、最富于侵略性的一部分；艾森豪威尔代表的是天字第一号的帝国主义。日本人民深知，要战胜这样的敌人，必须依靠全民族的动员，依靠千千万万的“普通人”的斗争。特别是在岸信介已用暴力在众议院非法强行“通过”了新日美“安全条约”以后，动员广大的群众在议会以外进行斗争，就具有决定性的意义。日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎说得好：现在不是同岸信介举行会谈的时候。“我们将唤起舆论，掀起反对他的巨大高潮，来对他施加压力”。浅沼还表示，社会党除了在参议院继续坚持拒绝审议以外，将在国会外面展开群众运动，以迫使岸信介辞职、解散国会和废除“安全条约”。这样的决定，无疑是会得到广大日本人民的支持的。因为当议会被日本反动派所控制并被利用为强奸民意的工具以后，在议会外面坚决地发动广泛的群众斗争，才能最后地击败岸信介卖国集团。反对新日美“安全条约”的斗争，归根到底，将取决于议会以外的群众斗争。日本人民第十六次统一行动，在短短的三个星期之内，动员了二千万人参加了罢工、集会、示威、请愿。这充分反映了日本人民的爱国正义斗争正在迅速扩大和深入，把街头、工厂和农村变为同日本反动派斗争的主要战场。这在反对新的日美“安全条约”的斗争中，是个重要的发展。我们坚信：当岸信介的卖国贼面目和艾森豪威尔这个凶神恶煞的面目被进一步暴露以后，当新日美“安全条约”对日本民族的危害被进一步揭露以后，日本人民的觉悟将会继续提高，就会有更多的群众投身于斗争之中。第十七次统一行动必将以更大的规模展开，艾森豪威尔同岸信介的互相勾结只能更进一步激发广大日本人民同美日反动派坚决斗争的意志。
    日本人民的斗争是艰巨的、长期的。但是，全世界爱好和平和主持正义的人民，都站在日本人民这一边。特别是当前的国际形势，对日本人民十分有利：美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策到处遭到反对，各国人民的反帝斗争蓬勃高涨。这一切很自然地形成对于日本人民的反美爱国正义斗争的有力支持。中国人民一向把日本人民的斗争看成是自己的斗争，并且始终不渝地坚决予以支持。历史是人民创造的，觉醒了的人民必然会掌握自己的命运。这一朴实、简明的真理，必将又一次地为日本人民的斗争所证实。我们坚信，在各国人民的支持下，英勇的日本人民一定能够坚持斗争，继续向前迈进。
