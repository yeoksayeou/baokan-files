Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd – News: Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party “anti-mainstream faction,” consisting of Diet members from the Kono faction, Matsumura-Miki faction, Ishibashi faction, and some Diet members from the Ohno faction and Ikeda faction, held a meeting on the evening of the 1st. At the meeting, they formed the "Alliance for Upholding Parliamentary Politics" to intensify activities to force Kishi Nobusuke to step down.

The news said that this "anti-mainstream faction" alliance will hold a plenary meeting of its affiliated Diet members on the 3rd and issue a joint statement demanding the immediate resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet.

This action by the "anti-mainstream faction" is taking place in a situation where the Socialist Party has decided that all of its members of the House of Representatives will resign en masse, Japanese workers are preparing to hold a general strike on the 4th, and the broad masses of the Japanese people are demanding Kishi Nobusuke's resignation with unprecedentedly large-scale actions. The news said that this action by the "anti-mainstream faction" has created a new threat from within for the Kishi Nobusuke group.

Kishi Nobusuke's confidant, Masajiro Kawashima, told reporters last night that the Liberal Democratic Party might split due to this decision by the "anti-mainstream faction."

    日本执政党“反主流派”加紧倒岸活动
    各派议员成立联盟要求岸信介内阁立即总辞职
    新华社2日讯　东京消息：日本执政党自由民主党“反主流派”的河野派、松村一三木派、石桥派的议员和大野派、池田派的部分议员1日晚举行会议，会上成立了“拥护议会政治联盟”，以便加紧迫使岸信介下台的活动。
    消息说，这个“反主流派”的联盟将在3日举行所属议员的全体会议，并且发表联合声明，要求岸信介内阁立即总辞职。
    “反主流派”的这一行动是在社会党决定它的全体众议员总辞职、日本工人准备在4日举行总罢工和日本广大人民以空前规模的行动要求岸信介下台的情况下发生的。消息说，“反主流派”的这一行动，给岸信介集团造成了来自身边的新的威胁。
    岸信介的亲信川岛正次郎昨晚对新闻记者表示，由于“反主流派”的这一决定，自由民主党有可能发生分裂。
