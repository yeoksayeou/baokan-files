    Advance High Waving the Red Flag of Mao Zedong Thought!
    —Dedicated to the National Conference of Heroes of Culture and Education—
    Guo Moruo
    Advance high waving the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought,
    To build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way,
    Whether it's education, culture, health, sports, or news,
    We must establish models in every aspect!
    Learn from the advanced, compete with the advanced, catch up with the advanced, help the backward—
    Overcome difficulties more quickly, and strive to find solutions!
    A cultural and technological revolution is in full swing across the country,
    Everywhere we see a hundred flowers blooming, and the old being replaced by the new.
    Yesterday still illiterate, today already a teacher!
    Yesterday still a nanny, today already an inventor!
    Why have such astonishing miracles appeared?
    The key lies in the leadership of the Party, having a political soul!
    Serving socialism is the foundation of culture and education,
    Combining with productive labor is the teaching policy.
    Promote the spirit of daring on the basis of science,
    Establish great ambitions, liberate thinking, and break down superstitions.
    What others have not done, we cannot wait for;
    What others have already done, we must never lag behind.
    Pomegranate flowers are welcoming us, bright red as fire,
    Let us rise continuously like the early summer sun.
    Drive has no limit, and upstream has no limit,
    We must catch up with and surpass the world's level.
    To build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way,
    Advance high waving the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought.

    高举起毛泽东思想的红旗前进！
    ——献给全国文教群英大会——
    郭沫若
    高举起毛泽东思想的红旗前进，
    为了多快好省把社会主义建成，
    不论是教育、文化、卫生、体育、新闻，
    我们在每一个方面要树立标兵！
    要学先进，比先进，赶先进，帮后进——
    把困难加紧克服，努力找寻窍门！
    在全国正大闹文化和技术革命，
    到处都看到百花齐放、推陈出新。
    昨天还是文盲，今天已成为先生！
    昨天还是保姆，今天已有了发明！
    为什么出现了奇迹如此地惊人？
    关键在党的领导，有了政治灵魂！
    为社会主义服务是文教的根本，
    和生产劳动结合是教学的方针。
    在科学的基础上发扬三敢精神，
    树立下大志，解放思想，破除迷信。
    人所未曾做到的，我们不能坐等；
    人所已曾做到的，我们决不后人。
    石榴花正鲜红如火地欢迎我们，
    让我们像初夏的太阳不断上升。
    干劲没有止境，上游也没有止境，
    一定要赶上和超过世界的水平。
    为了多快好省把社会主义建成，
    高举起毛泽东思想的红旗前进。
      一九六○年五月二十四日
