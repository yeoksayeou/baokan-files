Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 13th: According to reports in the local newspapers today, approximately 20,000 Sikhs held a demonstration in Delhi on the 12th, demanding the establishment of a separate Punjabi-speaking state, and clashed violently with armed police. This was the largest clash to occur in the capital since Indian independence.

According to "The Statesman", about 175 people were injured and one person died in the hours-long clashes between demonstrators and Indian police. The large-scale arrests by the police continued until 12:00 am today, with over 1,000 demonstrators arrested.

Indian newspapers, in discussing the course of the conflict, stated that when demonstrators attempted to march, a large number of armed police used batons to beat them and threw large amounts of tear gas. Demonstrators fought back against the police with stones and bricks, and attacked nearby police stations. Demonstrators also pulled reinforcement police officers from their horses and beat them. The conflict continued until the evening of the 12th.

Following the clashes, local authorities banned all kinds of marches, demonstrations, and gatherings in Delhi and New Delhi. It is reported that Akali party members of the Sikh ethnicity have been continuously entering the Indian capital from neighboring states in recent days, some of whom had already been arrested before the demonstration.

People who speak Punjabi in the Punjab region and other neighboring areas have been demanding the establishment of a Punjabi-speaking state based on language. This movement has intensified in the last two weeks. According to the "Times of India", as of June 10th, the Punjab State government had already arrested 1,752 Akali party members who advocate for the establishment of a Punjabi-speaking state. The Indian central government and the Congress Party are both opposed to the demand to establish a Punjabi-speaking state.
