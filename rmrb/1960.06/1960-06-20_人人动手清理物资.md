　　Everyone Participate in Cleaning Up Materials

　　Currently, Shanghai is carrying out a large-scale campaign to clean up materials. To further promote the campaign, the first step is to resolve the ideological obstacles of some comrades. A common view is that "there's not much profit to be made," and they say that after years of inventory clearance, there is "nothing left to clear." This view is clearly incorrect.

　　Despite years of inventory clearance, the potential of materials is still great. This is because raw materials are constantly being purchased, and products are constantly changing. What was once stagnant material yesterday may become urgently needed today due to product changes. Moreover, Shanghai has many factories and uses a lot of materials, which often leads to the accumulation of some scattered materials. When these are gathered together, they amount to a significant number. Some units, due to poor warehouse conditions and disorganized storage, have materials buried under waste or even sunk into the ground, unnoticed. As for leftover materials, scraps, substandard products, and waste that cannot be found on the books, the quantity is even greater. If these materials can be unearthed and properly allocated, they can play a significant role in production.

　　Some also say that "the task is heavy, and there's no time to squeeze in inventory clearance," fearing that cleaning up materials will affect other work. This is a thought that pits cleaning up materials against other work. In reality, cleaning up materials can be closely integrated with other work. Combining the cleanup of materials with current production, technological innovation, comprehensive utilization, patriotic sanitation, and other work can promote each other and enable the completion of various work tasks even better.

　　Still others are afraid that the cleared-out materials will be transferred away, thinking that "it's better to have it yourself." This localist ideology is also wrong. The purpose of this cleanup is mainly to reduce backlog and waste, so that most materials can be fully used where needed. The materials cleared out should first be used by the unit and system itself. As long as they can be used by the unit, they can be fully utilized. Stagnant materials and waste that the unit cannot use can be processed and remade into good materials to support other departments and units and promote the continued leap forward in the city's production. What's wrong with that? Any thought or practice that pits local interests against overall interests, and considers local interests without regard for overall interests, should be corrected through education.

### 人人动手清理物资

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    人人动手清理物资
    目前，上海市正在开展一个大规模的清理物资运动。要使运动进一步普遍开展，首先要解决某些同志思想上的障碍。比较普遍的是认为“油水不大”，他们说年年清仓，已经“无啥可清”了。这种看法显然是不对的。
    尽管年年清仓，但是物资的潜力仍然很大。这是因为原材料天天在进货，产品时时在变化，昨天是呆滞物资，今天随着产品的改变又成为急需的东西。而上海工厂多，用料大，经常要积存一些零星的材料，集中起来，就是一个很大的数字。有些单位，由于仓库条件不好，存放零乱，有些材料被压在废料下面，甚至陷在地下，没有发现。至于账面上找不到的余料、角料以及残次品和废品，数量更大。这些物资如果能够挖掘出来，并加以适当调剂，就能在生产上发挥很大作用。
    又有人说，“任务重，清仓工作插不进”，怕搞了清理物资，影响了别的工作。这是把清理物资和其它工作对立起来的想法。实际上，清理物资工作完全可以和其它工作密切结合起来。清理物资与当前生产、技术革新、综合利用、爱国卫生等工作结合在一块，就能互相促进，使各项工作任务完成得更好。
    也有些人害怕清出来的物资被调走，认为“娘有，爹有，不如自己有”。这种本位主义思想更是错误的。这次清理物资的目的，主要是减少积压和浪费，使大部分物资都能充分地用到需要的地方去。清出来的物资，首先由本单位、本系统使用，只要自己能用的，可以充分加以利用。自己用不着的呆滞材料和废品，拿出来加工改制，可以变成好材料，支持其他部门和单位，促进全市生产继续跃进，这有什么不好呢？任何把局部利益和整体利益对立起来，为了局部利益而不考虑整体利益的想法和做法都应通过教育加以改正。（摘自解放日报）
