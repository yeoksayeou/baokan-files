    Xinhua News Agency, 16th. Chinese industrial unions today sent telegrams to their Japanese counterparts, severely condemning the bloody suppression of patriotic Japanese people by the US-Japan reactionaries and expressing firm support for the Japanese people's just anti-American patriotic struggle.

    The National Committee of the Chinese Heavy Industry Union, in telegrams sent to the Japan Federation of Metal Mine Workers' Unions and the Japan Federation of Synthetic Chemistry Workers' Unions, said that the struggle of Japanese workers and people against the Japan-US military alliance treaty and against Eisenhower's visit to Japan is entirely just and necessary. Chinese heavy industry workers and the Chinese people express immense anger at the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary government's bloody suppression of the Japanese people, profound condolences to the patriotic students who died, and cordial sympathy to the injured and the families of the martyrs. Chinese heavy industry workers firmly believe that as long as Japanese workers and people strengthen unity and persevere in struggle, they will surely be able to shatter the Japan-US military alliance treaty and drive US imperialism out of Japan.

    The National Committee of the Chinese Coal Miners' Union said in a telegram to the Japan Coal Miners' Union that the blood of patriotic Japanese people has thoroughly exposed the狰狞 face of US imperialism and its running dog, the Kishi Nobusuke clique, as enemies of the people. Chinese coal miners express deep mourning for the sacrificed Japanese patriotic students and extend cordial sympathy to their families and the injured students.

    The National Committee of the First Machine Industry Union of China, in a telegram to the All Japan Metal Workers' Union, stated that Chinese machinery workers express boundless indignation at the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary government's heinous act of bloody slaughter of the Japanese people in order to "protect" Eisenhower's visit to Japan. Chinese machinery workers firmly support the heroic struggle of Japanese workers and people against Eisenhower's visit to Japan, demanding the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, and demanding the dissolution of the Diet, and firmly believe that as long as they strengthen unity, widely mobilize the masses, and persevere in struggle, they will ultimately achieve final victory.

    The National Committee of the Chinese Light Industry Union telegraphed the Japan Paper and Pulp Workers' Union, saying that the Kishi Nobusuke traitorous clique, in order to protect Eisenhower's visit to Japan, actually instructed a large number of fascist bandits to slaughter patriotic students. We feel extremely angry about this and express our serious protest.

    The National Committee of the Chinese Railway Workers' Union, in telegrams sent to the Japan National Railway Workers' Union, the National Railway Engine Drivers' Union, and the Private Railway Workers' Union, said that Chinese railway workers are excited about the heroic actions of Japanese railway workers in the second general strike and express their firm support. We feel extremely indignant at the Kishi Nobusuke clique's use of fascist brutality to kill and injure patriotic demonstrators. We express our condolences to the heroic martyrs and extend our heartfelt sympathy to the injured and the families of the martyrs.

    The National Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union telegraphed the All Japan Dockworkers' Union, saying that the blood of the patriotic Japanese people has thoroughly exposed the ugly face of the Kishi Nobusuke traitorous government in its willingness to brutally massacre the Japanese people in order to pass the Japan-US military alliance treaty and "protect" Eisenhower's visit to Japan. Chinese dockworkers and the people of the whole country express immense anger at the Kishi Nobusuke government's crime of slaughtering the people. Chinese dockworkers and the people of the whole country fully support your struggle, and final victory will surely belong to you.

    The National Committee of the Chinese Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union telegraphed the Japan National Postal Workers' Union, expressing heartfelt respect for the heroic actions taken by the Japanese postal workers in the "June 15th" general strike; expressing boundless anger at the Kishi Nobusuke government's crime of slaughtering the people; and expressing heartfelt condolences and cordial sympathy to the gloriously sacrificed and injured Japanese patriotic students and their families. Chinese postal and telecommunications workers and the people of the whole country will always unswervingly and resolutely support your anti-American patriotic struggle, and firmly believe that as long as you resolutely persist in mass struggle, no matter how many difficulties you encounter, you will eventually achieve final victory.

    The National Committee of the Chinese Educational Workers' Union, in a telegram to the Japan Teachers' Union, said that Japanese teachers and staff resolutely participated in the second national general strike, dealing a heavy blow to the US-Japan reactionaries. We express our heartfelt respect and resolute support for this. The Kishi Nobusuke clique actually used a large number of police and fascist thugs to slaughter Japanese patriotic students. Chinese educators feel boundless anger; at the same time, we express our deep condolences to the gloriously sacrificed heroic students, and extend our cordial sympathy to their families and the injured patriotic students. We believe that the bloody atrocities of the US-Japan reactionaries in suppressing the patriotic Japanese people will further arouse the anger of the patriotic Japanese people and give the US-Japan reactionaries an even greater blow.
