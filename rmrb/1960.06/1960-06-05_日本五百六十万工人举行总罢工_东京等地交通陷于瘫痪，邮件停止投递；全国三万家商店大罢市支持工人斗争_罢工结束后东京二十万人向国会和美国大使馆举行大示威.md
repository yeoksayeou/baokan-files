Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Supported by people across the nation, 5.6 million Japanese workers launched a massive general strike across the country starting at 4:00 AM on June 4th. It was the largest strike since the war. The goals are to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, dissolve the Diet, abolish the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, and oppose Eisenhower's visit to Japan.

This general strike is an important part of the seventeenth national unified action by the Japanese people against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." Trains at Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Okayama, Shizuoka, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Sapporo stations belonging to the National Railway Workers' Union all stopped running on schedule. Bus unions in Kyoto and sailors in Yokohama also went on strike at the same time. Employees in telecommunications, post offices, steel, coal, hardware, shipbuilding, shipping, chemicals, printing, banking, and other industries belonging to "Sohyo" all participated in the general strike.

In Tokyo, from 4:00 AM, all trains, streetcars, and buses stopped running from the first departure. With the support of students, women, and people from all walks of life, railway workers completely controlled Shinagawa Station, the Tokyo railway hub. Tokyo Station, known as the "Gateway to Japan," was completely closed before 7:00 AM this morning.

Near the picket lines of striking workers at various stations in Tokyo, one could see famous professors, poets, painters, and actors who stayed with the workers all night, supporting and encouraging their strike. Workers at forty-nine branches of the Tokyo Central Post Office held a two-hour strike starting from the beginning of their shift. Mail delivery in Tokyo was completely stopped.

After the workers' strike ended, many places held rallies and demonstrations. In Tokyo, 200,000 workers, students, professors, cultural figures, office workers, merchants, and citizens held a massive demonstration towards the National Diet and the American Embassy.

On the same day, 30,000 stores across Japan held an unprecedented general strike, opposing the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and supporting the general strike of Japanese workers. In Tokyo, about 10,000 stores closed their doors from the morning and posted leaflets on their doors, expressing their firm will to demand the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, the dissolution of the Diet, the prevention of the ratification of the new "Security Treaty," and to participate in unified action.

    东京等地交通陷于瘫痪，邮件停止投递；全国三万家商店大罢市支持工人斗争

    本报讯　据新华社讯：日本五百六十万工人在全国人民支持下，6月4日从清晨四点开始，在全国各地轰轰烈烈地展开了战后最大规模的总罢工，要求打倒岸信介内阁、解散国会、废除日美军事同盟条约和反对艾森豪威尔访问日本。
    这次总罢工是日本人民反对新日美“安全条约”第十七次全国统一行动的重要组成部分。属于国营铁道工会的东京、大阪、名古屋、冈山、静冈、广岛、长崎和扎幌各车站的火车都按时停驶。京都的公共汽车工会和横滨港的船员也同时罢工。属于“总评”的各地电信、邮政、钢铁、煤炭、五金、造船、海运、化学、印刷、银行等职工都参加了总罢工。
    在东京市，从清晨四时起，所有的火车、电车和公共汽车都从第一班车开始停驶。在学生、妇女和各阶层人民的支持下，铁路工人完全控制了东京铁路枢纽品川车站，被称为“日本大门”的东京车站在今天早上七点以前完全被封闭。
    在东京各车站的工人罢工纠察线附近，可以看到著名的教授、诗人、画家、演员，他们通宵同工人们在一起，支持和鼓舞工人的罢工。东京中央邮局的四十九个分局的工人从上班时起举行了两小时的罢工。东京的信件投递工作完全停顿。
    在工人罢工结束后，许多地方都举行集会和示威。东京有二十万工人、学生、教授、文化界人士、职员、商人和市民向国会和美国大使馆举行大示威。
    同一天，日本共有三万家商店在全国各地举行空前未有的大罢市，反对日美军事同盟条约，支持日本工人的总罢工。在东京，约一万家商店从上午起关起大门，并且在门上贴出传单，表示他们要求岸信介内阁下台和解散国会、阻止批准新“安全条约”、以及参加统一行动的坚决意志。（详细报道见第三版）（附图片）
