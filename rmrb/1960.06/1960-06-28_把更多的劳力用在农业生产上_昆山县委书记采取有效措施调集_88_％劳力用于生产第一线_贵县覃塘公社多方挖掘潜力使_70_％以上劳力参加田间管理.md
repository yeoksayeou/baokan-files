Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing: The First Secretary of the Kunshan County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China took the lead in going deep into the field, meticulously exploring the potential of the labor force, and solved the key problem of insufficient labor force for major production projects in ZhengYi People's Commune during the busy farming season, ensuring the rapid and high-quality completion of rice transplanting.

When arranging the transplanting of intermediate rice, the 29 production brigades of ZhengYi People's Commune initially planned to need more than 2,200 transplanters, but after the transplanting began, only more than 1,100 laborers were actually involved in transplanting. As a result, the transplanting progress was slow and would take a long time.

Jiang Yuanwen, the First Secretary of the Kunshan County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, came to this commune to inspect production. He was very anxious when he saw that most of the fields had not yet been transplanted, so he asked the members of Rongming Brigade who were transplanting with concern: "Can the speed of transplanting be accelerated a bit?" The members said: "We have been transplanting for three days, and the work efficiency has generally improved, but there are too few people transplanting."

After further in-depth investigation among the members, he instructed Jiang Zhenzhong, the Secretary of the County Party Committee Secretariat who was stationed here to guide the work, to conduct a careful inspection of the fields, pig farms, and canteens to tap the potential of transplanters. Jiang Zhenzhong went to the first team of Shuguang Brigade. He saw that more than 40 people were participating in land preparation, while only five people were transplanting. Why did land preparation overwhelm transplanting work? He took a closer look and found that the method of land preparation was not correct. Instead of straightening the old field ridges, the old field ridges were completely destroyed and new field ridges were rebuilt, which was very labor-intensive. They went to the pig farm at the head of the field again. They saw six strong laborers building a new pigsty. These six people could also transplant rice. Jiang Zhenzhong told the team cadres to let them transplant rice first and then come back to build the pig farm in a few days. Jiang Zhenzhong felt that the potential of transplanters in this brigade was great as he looked around. Later, he also looked at the canteen and found that there were many young and strong cooks in the canteen, so he felt that there was also potential to be tapped in the canteen.

Shuguang Brigade held a meeting of team leaders that evening to study further tapping the potential of labor and transferring the labor force who could transplant rice to the front line. As a result, the entire brigade transferred 17 people from seven canteens and sideline production teams to transplant rice; the land preparation method was also changed, straightening the old field ridges, which saved 80% of the labor compared with the original method. In this way, the number of people participating in transplanting in the entire brigade increased a lot. The transplanting of 804 mu of intermediate rice in the entire brigade was completed four days ahead of the original plan.

County Party Secretary Jiang Zhenzhong and Commune Party Committee First Secretary Wang Meisheng specifically helped the cadres of the United Brigade to line up the transplanters and transferred and replaced more than 130 transplanters from sideline production teams, canteens, nurseries, cleaners, and temporarily less busy irrigation and drainage projects, making the labor force投入 into the production front line account for 88% of the total labor force.

The Commune Party Committee immediately convened a meeting to introduce and promote the experience of these two brigades in tapping the potential of the labor force. As a result, the number of transplanters in the entire commune quickly increased from more than 1,100 to 3,398, and the transplanting work of intermediate rice in the entire commune was completed five days ahead of the original plan.

This newspaper reported: Qingtang Commune in Guixian County, Guangxi, concentrated its main cadres and strong laborers to form a strong team for early rice field management, and late-stage field management was vigorously carried out.

After the commune basically completed the second weeding and second topdressing, some cadres and the masses developed a slack and complacent attitude, thinking that they had only weeded the fields once last year, but this year they had weeded twice and applied fertilizer, so production would definitely increase. As a result, there was a phenomenon of decentralized leadership and decentralized labor force. Of the 13,700 laborers in the entire commune, only more than 4,500 were involved in early rice field management, accounting for 32.8%. To this end, the Commune Party Committee, on the one hand, carried out a field management competition campaign with the brigade as the unit, criticized the slack and complacent mood, and once again set off a high tide of field management. The First Secretary of the Commune Party Committee took command, and of the 12 members, except for two who were in charge of industry and sideline production, the rest were in charge of field management. Cadres at all levels implemented a division of labor and contracted responsibility method: commune cadres contracted to the area, brigade cadres contracted to the production team, and production team cadres contracted to the area, and promoted the five-package responsibility system of contracting the area, contracting the completion of the task of the day, and contracting the change of the three types of fields.

At the same time, the entire commune adopted methods such as "press," "dig," "replace," and "slow down" to transfer nearly 3,000 strong laborers from all aspects into field management. In this way, the number of people participating in field management every day reached 9,000 to 10,000, accounting for more than 70% of the total labor force, of which strong laborers accounted for about 60%. In addition, industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and soldiers were organized to implement large-scale support and large-scale cooperation. There were 2,800 government cadres and school teachers and students who participated in sending fertilizer.

There are many field management projects, and the labor force must be arranged and used rationally. According to the needs of various tasks, the commune arranged 45% of the labor force to engage in weeding and topdressing, 40% of the labor force to accumulate and manufacture fertilizer, 10% of the labor force to eliminate diseases and insect pests, and 5% of the labor force to engage in other work in field management. Major cadres were responsible for each of these fronts. In order to overcome the phenomenon of idling and waste and improve work efficiency, work groups were divided based on the specialty and strength of each person and labor force, with the production team as the unit. Before the division of work groups, each person in the Minquan Brigade transported an average of 17 loads of fertilizer per day, and after the division of work groups, it increased to 23 loads.

Because this commune organized a labor force with strong leadership, elite soldiers and fierce generals, and tight organization, field management has achieved great results. According to the 6/18 rice seedling queue, the first-class rice seedlings in the entire commune increased from more than 15,800 mu in late May to more than 38,000 mu, and the third-class rice seedlings decreased from more than 13,700 mu to more than 3,000 mu.

### 把更多的劳力用在农业生产上  昆山县委书记采取有效措施调集88％劳力用于生产第一线  贵县覃塘公社多方挖掘潜力使70％以上劳力参加田间管理

    昆山县委书记采取有效措施调集88％劳力用于生产第一线
    贵县覃塘公社多方挖掘潜力使70％以上劳力参加田间管理
    据新华社南京讯　中共江苏省昆山县县委第一书记带头深入现场，具体细致地挖掘劳动力潜力，解决了正仪人民公社在农忙季节里主要生产项目劳动力不足的关键性问题，保证了插秧工作又快又好。
    正仪人民公社的二十九个生产大队在安排中稻插秧的时候，初步计划需要两千二百多个插秧手，但开始插秧以后，真正投入插秧的只有一千一百多个劳动力。因此，插秧进度缓慢，要拖长插秧时间。
    中共昆山县委第一书记姜元文来到这个公社检查生产，他看到这里大部分田还没有插秧，心里很焦急，就关切地问正在插秧的荣明大队的社员：“能不能把插秧的速度加快一点？”社员们说：“我们插了三天秧，工效普遍提高了，就是插秧的人太少了。”
    他经过进一步深入到社员中摸底以后，指示在这里坐镇指导工作的县委书记处书记姜振中要到田里、猪场、食堂进行细致地查看，挖掘插秧手的潜力。姜振中到了曙光大队的一小队。他看到那里正在参加整田的人有四十多个，而插秧的却只有五个人。为什么整田会压倒插秧工作呢？他仔细一看，发现整田的方法不对头，没有在旧田埂的基础上裁弯取直，而是把旧田埂全部破坏，重做新田埂，因此费工很多。他们又到田头猪场。看到有六个强劳动力正在搭建一座新猪舍。这六个人又都会插秧。姜振中就告诉队干部，要让他们先去插秧，过几天再来突击建猪场。姜振中在这个大队越看越感到插秧手的潜力很大。后来，他又看了食堂，发现食堂中年青力壮的炊事员很多，便觉得食堂中也有潜力可挖。
    曙光大队在当天晚上召开了小队长会议，研究进一步挖掘劳动潜力，把会插秧的劳力调到第一线去。结果，全大队从七个食堂和副业队共抽出十七人去插秧；整田方法也改变了，在旧田埂基础上裁弯取直，比原来节省了80％的劳动力。这样，全大队参加插秧的人就增加了很多。全大队八百零四亩中稻的栽插工作，比原订计划提前四天完成。
    县委书记姜振中和公社党委第一书记王梅生，又具体地帮联合大队干部把插秧手排了队，从副业队、食堂、托儿所、清洁员以及暂时不太忙的排灌工程中，抽调和替换出一百三十多个插秧手，使投入生产第一线的劳动力达到占全部劳动力的88％。
    公社党委会立即召开了会议，介绍和推广了这两个大队挖掘劳动力潜力的经验。于是，全社插秧手迅速从一千一百多人增加到三千三百九十八人，结果全社的中稻插秧工作，比原计划提前五天完成。
    本报讯　广西贵县覃塘公社集中主要干部和精壮劳动力，组成一支强有力的早稻田间管理队伍，后期田间管理蓬勃开展。
    这个公社在基本结束二耘二追以后，部分干部、群众曾产生松劲自满情绪，认为去年只耘一次田，今年已耘两次，又放了肥料，肯定增产了。因此出现了领导分散、劳动力分散的现象。全社一万三千七百个劳动力，投入早稻田间管理的只有四千五百多人，占32．8％。为此，公社党委一方面以大队为单位，开展田间管理评比运动，批判松劲自满情绪，再次掀起田间管理高潮。公社党委第一书记挂帅，十二个委员，除两个抓工副业外，其余的人都抓田间管理。各级干部实行了分工包干办法：公社干部包到片，大队干部包到生产队，生产队干部包到垌，并且推行包地区、包完成当天任务、包改变三类田等五包责任制。
    与此同时，全公社采取“压”、“挖”、“换”、“缓”等办法，从各个方面抽调了将近三千个精壮劳动力投入田间管理。这样，每天参加田间管理的就达到九千至一万人，占总劳动力70％以上，其中精壮劳动力约占60％。此外，还组织工农商学兵，实行大支援大协作。参加送肥的机关干部、学校师生就有二千八百人。
    田间管理项目较多，劳动队伍必须合理地安排使用。这个公社根据各项工作需要，安排45％的劳动力搞耘田追肥，40％的劳动力积制肥料，10％的劳动力除治病虫害，5％的劳动力搞田间管理中的其它工作。这几条战线每条都有主要干部负责。为了克服窝工浪费现象，提高工作效率，又以生产队为单位，根据各人专长和劳动力强弱，划分成作业组。民权大队在划分作业组以前，每人每天平均运肥十七担，划分作业组以后，增加到二十三担。
    由于这个公社组织了一支有坚强领导，有精兵猛将，组织严密的劳动队伍，田间管理取得了很大成绩。据6月18日禾苗排队，全公社一类禾已由5月下旬的一万五千八百多亩增加到三万八千多亩，三类禾由一万三千七百多亩下降到三千多亩。（附图片）
