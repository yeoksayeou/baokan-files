Xinhua News Agency, June 3rd – The Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions today telegraphed the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), fully supporting the just anti-American patriotic struggle of the Japanese working class and the broad masses of the people.

The telegram from the Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions stated: "In the name of over 100 million members, we warmly applaud the unwavering and exemplary joint struggle of more than four million Japanese workers, together with the broad masses of the Japanese people, to abolish the aggressive Japan-U.S. treaty.

"As the national general strike is scheduled for June 4th, we guarantee them our full support. We applaud their significant contribution to the struggle of the people and workers of Asia and the world against the threat of war, and wish them complete victory."

Xinhua News Agency, June 3rd – The All-China Federation of Trade Unions today sent a telegram to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan and the National Council Against Revision of the Security Treaty, resolutely supporting the 17th unified action of the Japanese people against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

The telegram said: "Chinese workers extend their highest respect once again to the heroic struggle of Japanese workers and people who have continuously carried out sixteen unified actions against the Japan-U.S. military alliance, express their heartfelt congratulations on the important achievements already made by Japanese workers and people in this great struggle concerning the fate of the Japanese nation, and at the same time express their resolute support for the national general strike and the 17th unified action held by Japanese workers and people to smash the Japan-U.S. military alliance.

"The Kishi Nobusuke clique, acting on the aggressive intentions of its American masters, violently and illegally forced the 'passage' of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty in such a scandalous farce, thoroughly exposing its reactionary nature and its ambition to accelerate militarist expansion.

"After the Kishi Nobusuke clique announced the 'passage' of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, the Japanese workers and people immediately launched a new high tide of struggle, unprecedented in scale and momentum, to smash the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, and demand the dissolution of the Diet. This shows that the Japanese workers and people have the determination and confidence to bury the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary clique and drive the American aggressor forces out of Japan.

"The Chinese workers and the people of the whole country, past, present and future, resolutely support the Japanese workers and people's just anti-American patriotic struggle. We firmly believe that as long as they strengthen unity, persist in struggle, and with the support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the peace-loving people of the world, the Japanese workers and people will surely achieve final victory.

"We wish the national general strike and the 17th unified action of the Japanese workers and people to smash the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty a brilliant success!"

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 3rd – According to the Vietnam News Agency, Hoang Quoc Viet, Chairman of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, expressed his warm support for the 17th National Unified Action and the general strike planned for tomorrow by the Japanese people to oppose the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

In a telegram to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, Hoang Quoc Viet said that the workers and all the people of Vietnam felt extremely indignant at the Kishi Nobusuke government's high-handed measures to forcibly "pass" the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in the House of Representatives. He wished the Japanese people's struggle to abolish the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," to demand the resignation of Kishi Nobusuke and the dissolution of the Diet, and to oppose all aggressive plans of U.S. imperialism would achieve final victory.

The Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace and the Vietnam Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee also jointly telegraphed relevant organizations in Japan, supporting the just struggle of the Japanese people.
