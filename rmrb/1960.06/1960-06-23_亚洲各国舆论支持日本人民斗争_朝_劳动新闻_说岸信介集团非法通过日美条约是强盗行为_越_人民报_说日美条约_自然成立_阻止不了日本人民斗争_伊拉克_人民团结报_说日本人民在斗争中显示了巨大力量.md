Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 21st: The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial today, strongly condemning the Kishida Nobusuke clique's act of "passing" the aggressive U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty by so-called "automatic enactment," disregarding the unanimous opposition of the Japanese people and the people of the world.

The editorial said that the Kishida Nobusuke clique's robbery is a brutal trampling on the national independence and security of the Japanese people, and also a challenge to peace in the Far East and the world. The Korean people resolutely condemn this adventurous act by the Kishida Nobusuke clique.

The editorial said that no one but the Kishida Nobusuke clique recognizes this aggressive treaty in Japan. The editorial concluded that the struggle of the Japanese people, supported and aided by the socialist camp and peace-loving people all over the world, will surely be victorious.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 21st: The Vietnamese "Nhan Dan" pointed out today that the Kishida Nobusuke clique's action of declaring the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty as "automatically enacted" cannot stop the Japanese people's struggle for peace and for Japan's true independence. "Final victory will surely belong to the heroic Japanese people."

The commentary said: "The victories and valuable experience gained by the Japanese people in their struggles in the past show that as long as they continue to strengthen unity and struggle, with the support of peace-loving people in Asia and the world, the Japanese people are fully capable of abolishing the U.S.-Japan military treaty and overthrowing the pro-American dictatorial clique in Japan."

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, June 20th: The Iraqi "People's Unity" published an editorial today, saying that the tremendous upsurge in the Japanese people's movement against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and the Kishida Nobusuke traitorous government in the past few months is a great contribution to today's overwhelming tide against imperialist aggression policies.

The newspaper said that Eisenhower's forced postponement of his visit to Japan and the absolute isolation of Kishida Nobusuke and his policies are the initial victories of the vigorous liberation movement of the Japanese people. The newspaper pointed out that the Japanese people have demonstrated their infinitely great strength in the movement. The characteristic of this movement is that it is directly aimed at imperialism, against aggression and war preparation policies.

The newspaper pointed out that the Japanese people will definitely realize their desire to abolish U.S. military bases in their country.

    据新华社平壤21日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表社论，强烈谴责日本岸信介集团不顾日本人民和全世界人民的一致反对，以所谓“自然成立”的强盗方法“通过”侵略性的日美军事同盟条约的行为。
    社论说，岸信介集团的这种强盗行为是对日本人民的民族独立和安全的粗暴的蹂躏，也是对远东和世界和平的挑战。朝鲜人民坚决谴责岸信介集团的这一冒险行为。

    据新华社河内21日电　越南“人民报”今天指出，日本岸信介集团宣布日美军事同盟条约“自然成立”的行径，决不能阻止日本人民为和平、为日本的真正独立所进行的斗争。“最后的胜利一定属于英雄的日本人民。”
    评论说：“日本人民在过去时期的斗争中所获得的胜利和宝贵的经验表明，只要继续加强团结和斗争，在亚洲和世界爱好和平人民的支持下，日本人民就完全有足够的力量废除日美军事条约，推翻日本亲美独裁集团”。
    据新华社巴格达20日电　伊拉克“人民团结报”今天发表社论说，日本人民在过去几个月中反对日美“安全条约”和岸信介卖国政府的运动的巨大高涨，是对今天压倒帝国主义侵略政策的浪潮的巨大贡献。
    报纸说，艾森豪威尔被迫延期访日以及岸信介和他的政策的绝对孤立是日本人民蓬勃的解放运动的初步胜利。报纸指出，日本人民在运动中显示出他们无限巨大的力量。这个运动的特点是直接针对帝国主义，针对侵略和备战政策。
    报纸指出，日本人民肯定会实现在他们国家里的撤销美国军事基地的愿望。
