Xinhua News Agency, June 18th: He Xiangning, Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, issued the following statement today regarding Eisenhower's Far East bandit trip:

    In order to maintain its aggressive base in Asia, strengthen its oppression of the people of Asian countries, and prepare to launch new wars of aggression, U.S. imperialism sent its ringleader Eisenhower to the Far East to carry out conspiratorial activities; this once again exposed the aggressive and bellicose nature of U.S. imperialism and Eisenhower's wolfish face, arousing great public outrage throughout the world.

    We feel immense anger at Eisenhower's setting foot on our sacred territory of Taiwan. Eisenhower and Dulles are birds of a feather. His purpose in going to Taiwan, like the deceased Dulles, is to separate Taiwan from China and turn it completely into a U.S. colony. This is absolutely intolerable to every patriotic Chinese. The artillery of our People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front has issued the angry roar of our people. This is a serious warning to the plague god Eisenhower, and also strong support for the anti-U.S. struggle of the people of Asian countries and our patriotic compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu.

    As pointed out in the "Letter to Compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu" from the Fujian Front Command of our People's Liberation Army, there will be no good end for those who act as loyal running dogs of the United States, following others' lead. They will either be buried with them or sacrificed by them. Syngman Rhee and Menderes are lessons from the past. Since the Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan claim to be followers of Mr. Sun Yat-sen and fly the banner of the Three People's Principles, they should have patriotism. From the perspective of national righteousness, U.S. imperialism is our enemy and also your enemy. There is a way out for the Kuomintang people in Taiwan, and that is to inherit and carry forward Mr. Sun Yat-sen's heroic and unyielding patriotic and anti-imperialist spirit. Mr. Sun Yat-sen consistently opposed the colonial policies of imperialism. He once severely condemned the United States' aggression against the Philippines and hated the Japanese imperialists for occupying our territory of Taiwan. We hope that the Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan can follow Mr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and, together with the people of the motherland and the broad masses of patriotic military and civilians in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, oppose U.S. imperialism's armed occupation of Taiwan and oppose its conspiracy to create "two Chinas." Anyone who stands on the patriotic and anti-American position will be welcomed by the people of the motherland and will receive the support of the powerful motherland. If they act as accomplices and persist in their evil ways, they will be digging their own graves and bringing about their own destruction.

    The great Chinese people have full confidence and strength to smash any obstruction and sabotage by U.S. imperialism, liberate Taiwan, and realize the complete reunification of the motherland. Every crime committed by U.S. imperialism against the Chinese people will receive its due punishment. The day when we settle the general account with U.S. imperialism is not far off. The Chinese people will absolutely not spare U.S. imperialism.

    We express our highest respect to the Japanese people who are bravely opposing the U.S.-Japan reactionaries. Facing the angry Japanese people, Eisenhower had to adopt a "shrinking" tactic and was forced to announce the postponement of his "visit" to Japan. This is a preliminary victory for the Japanese people's anti-American struggle, and also a victory with great significance and profound impact. The Japanese people's patriotic and anti-imperialist spirit of struggle is worthy of emulation by all those who do not want to be slaves of U.S. imperialism. We strongly condemn Nobusuke Kishi's crime of massacring patriotic Japanese people, and express our deep condolences to the martyrs and their families. The blood of the martyrs was not shed in vain, and will never be shed in vain; blood debts must be repaid with blood. The Japanese people are advancing victoriously to carry out the struggle to overthrow the traitorous Nobusuke Kishi government, abolish the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, and strive for national independence and democratic freedom to the end. Final victory will surely belong to the unyielding Japanese people. Our 650 million Chinese people will always stand by the Japanese people and pledge our full support for the Japanese people's just patriotic and anti-American struggle.

    The facts clearly tell everyone that U.S. imperialism's aggressive and bellicose nature has not changed in the slightest, nor will it ever change. Only by launching an irreconcilable struggle against U.S. imperialism can its aggression be stopped; only by overthrowing imperialism, first of all by overthrowing the heinous U.S. imperialism, can true and lasting world peace be realized. U.S. imperialism is already besieged on all sides, at the end of its rope, full of evil deeds, and its lifespan is not long. People of the world who love peace should unite more closely, strengthen the struggle against U.S. imperialism, and overthrow U.S. imperialism!

    粉碎美帝国主义的阴谋实现祖国的统一
    中国国民党革命委员会副主席何香凝发表声明
    新华社18日讯　中国国民党革命委员会副主席何香凝今天就艾森豪威尔的远东强盗旅行发表声明如下：
    美帝国主义为了维持它在亚洲的侵略阵地，加强对亚洲各国人民的压迫，准备发动新的侵略战争，元凶艾森豪威尔亲自出马，到远东地区进行阴谋活动；这就再一次暴露了美帝国主义侵略好战的本性和艾森豪威尔的豺狼面目，激起了全世界人民极大的公愤。
    我们对于艾森豪威尔踏上我国的神圣领土台湾感到无比的愤怒。艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯是一丘之貉，他到台湾的目的，也和死去的杜勒斯一样，就是要把台湾从中国分裂出去，完全沦为美国的殖民地。这是每一个有爱国心的中国人所绝对不能容许的。我福建前线人民解放军的大炮，发出了我国人民愤怒的吼声。这是对瘟神艾森豪威尔的严重警告，也是对亚洲各国人民和我台、澎、金、马爱国同胞反美斗争的强有力的支持。
    正如我人民解放军福建前线司令部“告台、澎、金、马军民同胞书”所指出的，当美国的忠实走狗，随人俯仰，是不会有好下场的。不是替人殉葬，就是被人牺牲。李承晚、曼德列斯就是前车之鉴。在台湾的国民党军政人员既然自称是孙中山先生的信徒，打着三民主义的旗号，就应该有爱国心；从民族大义来说，美帝国主义是我们的敌人，也是你们的敌人。在台湾的国民党人是有出路的，就是要继承和发扬孙中山先生威武不屈的爱国反帝精神。孙中山先生是一贯反对帝国主义的殖民政策的，他曾经严厉谴责美国对菲律宾的侵略，痛恨日本帝国主义霸占我国的领土台湾，我们希望台湾的国民党军政人员能够遵循中山先生的遗教同祖国人民和台、澎、金、马广大爱国军民一道，反对美帝国主义武装霸占台湾，反对它制造“两个中国”的阴谋。任何人只要站在爱国反美的立场，就会受到祖国人民的欢迎，就能得到强大祖国的支持；如果为虎作伥，怙恶不悛，就是自掘坟墓，自取灭亡。
    伟大的中国人民完全有信心有力量粉碎美帝国主义的任何阻挠破坏，解放台湾，实现祖国的完全统一。美帝国主义对中国人民所犯下的每一罪行都将得到它应得的惩罚。我们同美帝国主义算总账的日子不会很远了，中国人民是绝对饶不了美帝国主义的。
    我们向英勇反对美日反动派的日本人民表示崇高的敬意。艾森豪威尔面对愤怒的日本人民，不得不采取“龟缩”的办法，被迫宣布延期“访问”日本，这是日本人民反美斗争的一个初步胜利，同时也是一个具有重大意义和深刻影响的胜利。日本人民爱国反帝的斗争精神，是值得一切不愿做美帝国主义的奴隶的人们学习的。我们严厉谴责岸信介屠杀日本爱国人民的罪行，向死难的烈士和他们的家属表示沉痛的哀悼。烈士们的鲜血没有白流，也永远不会白流；血债是要用血来还的。日本人民正在乘胜前进，要把打倒岸信介卖国政权、废除日美军事同盟条约、争取民族独立和民主自由的斗争进行到底，最后胜利一定属于不屈不挠的日本人民。我们六亿五千万中国人民永远站在日本人民一边，誓以全力支持日本人民爱国反美的正义斗争。
    事实很清楚的告诉大家，美帝国主义侵略好战的本性丝毫没有改变，也永远不会改变。只有同美帝国主义展开不调和的斗争，才能制止它的侵略；只有打倒帝国主义，首先是打倒万恶滔天的美帝国主义，才能实现真正的世界持久和平。美帝国主义已经是四面楚歌，日暮途穷，恶贯满盈，寿命不长了。全世界爱好和平的人民更加紧密的团结起来，加强反对美帝国主义的斗争，打倒美帝国主义！
