Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, 20th - Head war-monger Eisenhower, after meeting with his South Korean lackey Heo Jeong today, issued a joint communiqué reiterating that the U.S. government will intensify its aggression and war conspiracies in the Far East, and persist in its policy of enslaving the South Korean people and obstructing Korean reunification.

The communiqué repeated the cliché that the U.S. launched the Korean War to "maintain peace in Asia," clamoring that the U.S. must continue to maintain a so-called "strong position" in South Korea as it has for the past decade, and saying this is a "significant factor" in U.S. policy.

Eisenhower reaffirmed in the communiqué the U.S. government's guarantee of "continued support" for the South Korean puppet regime. The communiqué clamored for maintaining the "alliance" between the U.S. and South Korea "and maintaining vigilance and strength, patience and vision in pursuing the goals of this alliance."

The communiqué reiterated the intention to use the resolutions on the Korean question illegally passed by previous sessions of the United Nations General Assembly to annex the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and extend the clutches of the U.S. and its South Korean puppet to the entire Korean peninsula.

The communiqué also emphasized Eisenhower's hope that the South Korean puppet regime would "become a formal member of the United Nations," plotting to have Heo Jeong and his ilk usurp the Korean people's seat in the United Nations.

Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, 20th - Speaking to the South Korean puppet parliament today, Eisenhower declared that the U.S. government will continue to forcibly occupy South Korea and be hostile to the Korean people.

He said that he "guarantees compliance" with the "obligations" of the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" concluded with Syngman Rhee and will continue to support South Korea.

Eisenhower clamored that South Korea should be further placed under U.S. control. He said, "The cooperation between our two countries has gone deep into many aspects—education, industry, defense, agriculture, social welfare." He shouted that "we must work together with the purpose of cooperation, otherwise we will simply lose the right to work in freedom."

Eisenhower said that the "cause for which the United States has fought in Korea" is to strengthen and defend this country based on the so-called "principles of democracy, government of the people, by the people, for the people" on the Asian continent. He blatantly revealed his ambition to annex the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, saying, "Your achievements in this regard will be an encouragement to your compatriots in the North, and I sincerely wish that one day they will live with you in a free and unified Korea."

    艾森豪威尔和傀儡许政发表公报
    美国坚持推行侵略政策
    新华社20日讯　汉城消息：头号战争贩子艾森豪威尔今天和他的南朝鲜奴才许政会谈后发表了一个联合公报，重申美国政府要加紧在远东进行侵略和战争阴谋，并且坚持推行奴役南朝鲜人民和阻挠朝鲜统一的政策。
    公报重弹美国发动侵朝战争是“维护亚洲和平”的滥调，叫嚷美国要像过去十年一样继续在南朝鲜保持所谓“强有力的阵地”，并且说，这是美国政策的“重大的因素”。
    艾森豪威尔在公报中重申美国政府“继续支持”南朝鲜傀儡政权的保证。公报叫嚷要维护美国和南朝鲜之间的“（军事）联盟并且在贯彻这一联盟争取的目标的过程中保持警惕和力量，耐心和远见”。
    公报重申要利用过去许多届联合国大会非法通过的关于朝鲜问题的决议来并吞朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，把美国及其南朝鲜傀儡的统治魔掌伸展到全朝鲜。
    公报同时还强调艾森豪威尔希望南朝鲜傀儡政权“成为联合国的正式成员”，阴谋使许政之流窃据朝鲜人民在联合国中的席位。
    新华社20日讯　汉城消息：艾森豪威尔今天在南朝鲜傀儡议会讲话时声言，美国政府将继续强占南朝鲜，与朝鲜人民为敌。
    他说，他“保证遵照”同李承晚所订立的所谓“共同访御条约”的“义务”，继续支持南朝鲜。
    艾森豪威尔叫嚷南朝鲜应进一步置于美国的控制之下。他说，“我们两国之间的合作，已深入到许多方面——教育、工业、防御、农业、社会福利”。他叫喊“必须抱着合作的目的共同工作，不然我们将干脆失掉在自由中工作的权利”。
    艾森豪威尔说，美国“在朝鲜为之斗争的事业”，是要在亚洲大陆上加强和保卫这个以所谓“民治、民享的原则为基础的国家”。他露骨地表明了并吞朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的野心，他说，“你们在这方面的成就，对于你们在北方的同胞将是一种鼓励，我热诚祝愿他们有一天将同你们一起在一个自由而统一的朝鲜中生活。
