    Ten Thousand Cannons Fire in Unison to Drive Away the "Plague God"
    Xinhua News Agency Frontline Reporter Jun Fen
    At three o'clock in the morning on the 19th, after the Fujian Frontline Broadcasting Station of the Chinese People's Liberation Army broadcast the "Letter to the Military and Civilians of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu" from the Fujian Frontline Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, it announced: The anti-American demonstration artillery bombardment of the Fujian Frontline of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has begun!
    In the moonlight, artillery heroes and militia heroes participating in the battle quickly wiped the shells clean, waiting to fire and bombard the "plague god." Zhu Lusheng, a gunner from the Second Squad of a certain artillery unit of the People's Liberation Army, said angrily: "Eisenhower, this big 'plague god,' recently sabotaged the four-nation government summit and now has run to Taiwan to engage in war conspiracies. The Chinese people cannot be deceived. We will bombard him out of Taiwan!"
    At precisely six o'clock, the order to open fire and bombard the "plague god" reached the position. Angry artillery warriors and militia gunners fiercely pulled the firing cords. Thereupon, a barrage of cannons roared, shaking the earth and mountains. Angry artillery fire, from various directions, simultaneously struck the Greater Kinmen, Lesser Kinmen, Greater Dadan, Lesser Dadan, and other islands shrouded in clouds. The heroes raised their arms and shouted: "War 'plague god' Eisenhower, get out!" "Resolutely liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu!" "Resolutely support the just struggle of the people of Asian countries against Eisenhower's bandit trip!"
    In order to fiercely bombard the "plague god," gunner Chen Huanai continuously loaded more than a hundred shells, sweating profusely. While working hard with his bare chest, he angrily shouted: "Fire! Fire quickly! Hurry and drive away Eisenhower, this big 'plague god'!" Xu Jiabao, the commander of the fourth gun, who had received a collective third-class merit in the 1958 battle to punish the Chiang Kai-shek troops in Kinmen, shouted angrily: "Fire! Hit them hard! Let the American robbers tremble in the roar of 650 million Chinese people!" The gunners of this cannon, Zhuang Shuitian and Zhuang Haoyuan, were uncle and nephew. During the demonstration bombardment, the two brothers cooperated closely, taking turns loading and pulling the breech, firing more and more fiercely.
    At the artillery second company's position, militia deputy instructor Huang Qingshui and deputy platoon leader Wu Guangming took turns firing and loading, one rapid shot after another. To speed up the firing rate, Huang Qingshui, like an experienced gunner, did not use a ramrod when loading, directly pushing the shell into the chamber with his fist. The bombardment of the "plague god" became more and more energetic. At this time, heroic female militiamen came carrying loads of tea water. While distributing the tea water bowl by bowl to the gunners, they said excitedly: "Comrades, hit them hard, speed up the firing, and resolutely drive the 'plague god' out of Taiwan!"
    The anti-American demonstration bombardment of ten thousand cannons to drive away the plague god rose wave upon wave until the war "plague god" Eisenhower slunk away from Taiwan. The heroes were still roaring: "Eisenhower, get out!" "American imperialism, get out of Taiwan!"

    万炮齐发　轰逐“瘟神”
    新华社前线记者　军奋
    19日清晨三点钟，中国人民解放军福建前线广播站在播送了福建前线司令部“告台、澎、金、马军民同胞书”后，就宣布说：中国人民解放军福建前线反美示威大炮击开始！
    在月光下，炮兵英雄和参战的民兵英雄们，迅速擦好炮弹，等候开炮轰逐“瘟神”。人民解放军炮兵某部二班炮手祝禄胜，愤怒地说：“艾森豪威尔这个大‘瘟神’，不久前破坏了四国政府首脑会议，现在又跑到台湾来搞战争阴谋，中国人民是不可欺侮的，我们把他轰出台湾去！”
    六时正，轰逐“瘟神”的开炮令传到阵地，愤怒的炮兵勇士和民兵炮手们，猛把拉火绳一拉，于是，群炮轰鸣，地动山摇。愤怒的炮火，从各个不同的方向，一齐打到云雾笼罩着的大金门、小金门、大担、二担等岛上。英雄们振臂高呼：“战争‘瘟神’艾森豪威尔滚蛋！”“坚决解放台、澎、金、马！”“坚决支持亚洲各国人民反对艾森豪威尔强盗旅行的正义斗争！”
    为了猛轰“瘟神”，炮手陈华奶连续装填了一百多发炮弹，热得满身大汗。他一面光着膀子猛干，一面愤怒地高呼着：“快打啊，赶快赶走艾森豪威尔这个大‘瘟神’！”在1958年惩罚金门蒋军战斗中立集体三等功的四炮炮长徐加宝愤怒地喊着：“开炮呀！狠狠地打。让美国强盗在六亿五千万中国人民的怒吼声中发抖吧！”这门炮的炮手庄水田、庄豪源是叔伯兄弟，示威炮击时，兄弟两个密切配合，轮流装填和拉炮闩，越打越猛。
    在炮兵二连阵地上，民兵副教导员黄清水和副排长吴光明两人轮流击发、轮流装填，一个急速射接着一个急速射地猛轰。为了加快开炮速度，黄清水像老炮手一样，装填时不用送弹棍，直接用拳头把炮弹推进炮膛。轰“瘟神”的炮击越打越有劲。这时，英雄的女民兵们挑着一担担茶水赶来，她们一面把茶水一碗一碗地分送给炮手们，一面激动地说：“同志们，狠狠打，加紧打，坚决把‘瘟神’驱逐出台湾去！”
    万炮轰逐瘟神的反美大示威炮击，一浪高一浪，一直到战争“瘟神”艾森豪威尔灰溜溜地滚离台湾，英雄们还在怒吼：“艾森豪威尔滚出去！”“美帝国主义滚出台湾去！”
