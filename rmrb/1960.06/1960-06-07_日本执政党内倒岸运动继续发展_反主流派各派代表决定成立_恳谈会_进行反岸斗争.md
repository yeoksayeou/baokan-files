Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 4th: As the Japanese people's struggle against the United States and the Kishi Nobusuke group continues to escalate, the anti-Kishi movement within Japan's ruling party is continuing to develop.

    Liberal Democratic Party members from the Kono faction, the Miki-Matsumura faction, the Ishibashi faction, and the middle-of-the-road factions held a liaison meeting yesterday afternoon. They unanimously agreed that, in order to break away from the current situation, there is no other way than Kishi Nobusuke's resignation.

    In order to carry out future anti-Kishi activities, representatives of each faction decided to establish an organization called the "Liberal Democratic Party Like-Minded Diet Members Discussion Group" and set up an office in the center of Tokyo. The meeting also decided to hold another liaison meeting on the 6th, to observe the situation of the people's struggle outside the Diet while studying the specific date for the establishment of the "Discussion Group," with the goal of establishing it around the 10th.

    Prior to this, representatives of these four factions held a similar meeting on the 1st, making a decision to demand "Prime Minister Kishi's resignation." Kyodo News said that the activities and decisions of these four factions had a "considerable impact" on the mainstream faction. Kishi Nobusuke's confidant, Liberal Democratic Party Secretary-General Masajiro Kawashima, publicly threatened anti-mainstream lawmakers on the afternoon of the 2nd. He said something like "Postponing the issue of ratifying the security treaty and forcing Kishi Nobusuke to step down is a violation of the party's decision." He also said: "If this is the case, even a split is unavoidable."

    It is reported that Kishi Nobusuke once wanted to hold talks with Ichiro Kono, one of the leaders of the anti-mainstream faction. Kono refused Kishi Nobusuke's request on the grounds that their views on the current situation differed.

    日本执政党内倒岸运动继续发展
    反主流派各派代表决定成立“恳谈会”进行反岸斗争
    新华社4日讯　东京消息：随着日本人民反对美国和岸信介集团的斗争的不断高涨，日本执政党内的倒岸运动正在继续发展。
    自由民主党的河野派、三木—松村派、石桥派以及中间派的议员昨天下午举行联络人会议，他们一致认为，为了摆脱目前的局面，除了岸信介辞职以外，没有其他办法。
    为了进行今后的反岸活动，各派代表决定成立名为“自由民主党志同道合议员恳谈会”的组织，并在东京市中心设立办事处。会议还决定在6日再次召开联络人会议，一面观察国会外的人民斗争的形势，一面研究成立“恳谈会”的具体日期，目标是在10日前后成立。
    在这以前，这四派的代表曾经在一日举行同样的会议，作出了要求“岸首相下台”的决定，共同社说：这四派的活动和决定对主流派产生了“相当大的影响”。岸信介的亲信、自由民主党干事长川岛正次郎曾经在2日下午公开威胁反主流议员。他说什么“把批准安全条约问题搁置起来，逼迫岸信介下台，是违反党的决议的”。他还说：“如果这样的话，就是分裂也是不得已的”。
    据报道，岸信介曾经想同反主流派首脑之一河野一郎进行会谈。河野以对目前局势看法不同为理由，拒绝了岸信介的要求。
