Xinhua News Agency, Jinan: The Shandong Provincial Party Committee recently transferred another 850-plus capable cadres from provincial-level organizations, together with over 36,000 cadres organized by various special districts and counties, to focus on areas with the most difficulties and the poorest conditions, to vigorously promote backward areas and address weak links.

Among the provincial-level cadres sent to the countryside this time, more than half are at the level of department heads, bureau chiefs, section chiefs, and division chiefs of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee. Over 80% of the members of the local Party committees and county Party committees have also participated in this work.

This is the third time this year that Shandong Province has organized cadres on such a large scale to go deep into the front lines of production. Prior to this, the Shandong Provincial Party Committee had transferred more than 1,000 cadres from provincial-level organizations to focus on spring planting. They not only focused on advanced examples but also helped backward areas, eating, living, laboring, and consulting with the masses, achieving a "three-way combination" of work, labor, and study. At the same time, Party organizations at all levels enthusiastically responded to the Provincial Party Committee's call, leaving their offices and sending over 880,000 cadres to the fields. Over 80% of the counties and communes implemented the "four-to-the-field" approach (meetings, office work, ideological education, and material supply). This ensured the completion of spring planting work in terms of both quality and quantity. In Liaocheng City, 15,000 cadres shared the hardships with commune members in the fight against drought. Two thousand two hundred and forty-six cadres were rated as labor red banner pacesetters by the commune members. The commune members said: "The cadres have a good style, do everything on the spot, rely on the leadership of the Party, and guarantee a bumper harvest." Zhang Xuewei, the First Secretary of the Linyi Municipal Party Committee, led 7,500 cadres to go deep into the second and third category canteens, and within a few days helped 231 backward canteens improve to advanced levels. In many places, commune members happily said: "The secretary enters the canteen, the canteen changes, the life is greatly improved, and the food is hot and fragrant."

Recently, based on cadres going to the fields, many communes have begun to implement the "two-five system" of work methods. This working method not only makes cadres' presence in the fields regular and institutionalized, and properly solves the contradictions in cadres' work, labor, and study, but also further strengthens the leadership in the front line of production.

(Reported by this newspaper) Over 80% of the cadres in Huairou County, Beijing, have gone deep into the front line of production, eating, living, laboring, and consulting with the broad masses of commune members.

Now, the county Party secretary, the county head, and even the statisticians, accountants, administrators, custodians, health workers, and epidemic prevention workers of each commune are all on the front line of production. Li Xiaozhang, the First Secretary of the County Party Committee, found in his labor in the Fule Production Team of Chengguan Commune that the team planted more early-maturing crops and had less fertilizer reserves. After the summer harvest, the fertilizer would not be able to keep up with the needs of summer and autumn planting. After further understanding the situation in other places, he discussed with the members of the production team and worked out a cost effective method of pressing green manure in the fields, which solved the contradiction of insufficient fertilizer, and then promoted this method to the whole county. Wang Xirui, Deputy Secretary of the County Party Committee and County Head, led a working group to participate in the labor of the Beifang Production Team of Chengguan Commune. They found in production that the original more than 700 mu of high-yield paddy fields had been opened up, but because the reservoir could not release water in time, they prepared to change to dry land planting. He then called a forum of team cadres and old farmers, and tried to find a water source. After three days of rushing to open the canal, the problem of irrigation for the rice fields was solved. Now, the production enthusiasm of this team is very high. The number of people attending work has increased from the original 5,100 to 5,400. The cadres of the County Bureau of Commerce, based on the specific situation they learned in their labor, better deployed the work of commodity purchase and supply. Many communes had no way to transport vegetables after receiving them, so they tried to contact relevant departments to transfer transportation capacity, which solved the problem of getting vegetables to market. The working group of the County Bureau of Culture and Education, which participated in the labor of the Zhangzikou Production Team of Chengguan Commune, jointly studied the production situation with the production team cadres, and made unified arrangements for carrying out the pinyin literacy campaign, with production as the main focus. After obtaining pilot experience here, they made unified arrangements in the county, and now the pinyin literacy work has been carried out throughout the county.

The Huairou County Party Committee adopted a series of measures several months ago to enable cadres to go deep into the front line of production. They streamlined and merged some institutions and office work, and implemented the "two-five system." The offices of the County Party Committee's Finance and Trade Department, Industry Department, and other departments were also moved to production teams or county-owned factories. In the process of implementing these measures, the County Party Committee adopted the method of "four combinations": First, combining inside and outside, top and bottom. After the cadres went deep into the field, only a few people were left on duty inside the organization to handle daily work, and those that could not be handled were temporarily "recorded" and then studied and handled when the主管干部 returned to the organization on the weekly meeting day; second, combining point and surface. The cadres not only go deep into one point, but also go to other places to make general inspections, and study the overall situation at the meetings held in the county; third, combining participation in production with leadership in production; fourth, combining departmental business with the production center.

    山东第三次大规模组织干部下乡
    北京市怀柔县80％以上干部深入农村领导夏收夏种
    新华社济南讯　中共山东省委最近再次抽调省直属机关得力干部八百五十多人，会同各专区和县组织的三万六千多名干部，到困难最多、条件最差的地方，大抓后进，大抓薄弱环节。
    山东省这次下乡的直属机关干部中，省委部长、省人民委员会厅局长和处长科长级的干部占一半以上，各地委、县委委员80％以上也参加了这一工作。
    这样大规模地组织干部深入生产第一线，今年在山东省已是第三次了。在此以前，中共山东省委曾抽调省直属机关干部一千多人，重点深入地大抓春播工作。他们既抓先进，又帮落后，与群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，作到了工作、劳动、学习“三结合”。同时，各级党组织也热烈响应省委号召，纷纷走出办公室，先后有八十八万多名干部会师到田，并有80％以上的县和公社实行了会议、办公、思想教育、物资供应“四到田”。从而，保证了春播工作按质按量地完成。聊城市一万五千名干部在抗旱中与社员同甘共苦，有二千二百四十六名干部被社员评为劳动红旗标兵。社员们说：“干部作风好，样样现场干，依靠党领导，保证大丰产。”临沂市委第一书记张学伟等带领七千五百名干部分别深入到二、三类食堂，几天内就帮助二百三十一处后进食堂提高到先进水平。许多地方社员都高兴地说：“书记进食堂，食堂变了样，生活大改善，饭菜热又香。”
    最近，不少公社在干部会师到田的基础上，已开始实行“二五制”的工作方法。这种工作方法，不仅使干部会师到田经常化、制度化，妥善地解决了干部工作、劳动和学习上的矛盾，而且进一步加强了生产第一线的领导力量。
    本报讯　北京市怀柔县80％以上的干部都已深入生产第一线，和广大社员群众同吃同住同劳动同商量。
    现在，这个县的县委书记、县长，以至各公社的统计员、会计员、管理员、保管员、卫生员、防疫员等都在生产第一线上。县委第一书记李小章在城关公社富乐生产队劳动中，发现这个队种的早熟作物较多，肥料储备少，夏收后，肥料就跟不上夏种秋种的需要；他还在其它地方进一步了解后，便和这个生产队的社员们一块商量，研究出了一种多快好省的地头压绿肥的办法，解决了肥料不足矛盾，接着又把这个办法向全县推广。县委副书记、县长王锡瑞带领工作组参加城关公社北房生产队的劳动。他们在生产中发现这个队原来已经开出的七百多亩水稻丰产方，因水库不能及时放水，准备改种旱田。他就召集队干部和老农座谈，并设法寻找水源。经过三天突击开渠，解决了稻田用水问题。现在，这个队的生产积极性十分高涨。出勤人数由原来的五千一百多人增加到五千四百多人。县商业局的干部在劳动中根据所了解的具体情况，更好地部署了商品的收购和供应工作。不少公社收下蔬菜后，没法运输出去，他们便设法和有关部门联系，调来运输力，解决了菜蔬上市的问题。参加城关公社张自口生产队劳动的县文教局工作组，同生产队干部一起研究了生产情况，以生产为主，统一安排了关于开展拼音扫盲运动的工作。他们在这里取得试点经验后，又在全县作了统一布置，现在拼音扫盲工作已在全县开展起来。
    中共怀柔县委在使干部深入生产第一线方面，在几个月前，就采取了一系列的措施。他们精简合并了一些机构和机关工作，实行了“二五制”。县委财贸部、工业部等部的办公室也都搬到生产队或县属工厂办公。在贯彻这些措施的过程中，县委采用了“四结合”的方法：一、内外上下相结合。各部门在干部深入到下面去以后，机关内部只留下少数人值班，处理日常工作，处理不了的暂先“记账”，等每周会议日主管干部回机关时再研究处理；二、点和面相结合。干部不光深入一个点，而且还到其它地方去作一般检查，在县召开的会议上研究全面情况；三、参加生产同领导生产相结合；四、部门业务同生产中心相结合。（附图片）
