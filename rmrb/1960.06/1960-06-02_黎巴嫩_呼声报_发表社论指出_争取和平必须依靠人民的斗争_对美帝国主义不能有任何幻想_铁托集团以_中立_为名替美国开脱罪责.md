Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, May 31st. The Lebanese newspaper "Al Nida" published an editorial today, calling on the people of all countries around the world to strengthen the struggle for peace, and to harbor no illusions about the imperialists, especially U.S. imperialists.

The editorial, entitled "The Road to the Battle for Winning Peace," said that the recent U.S. espionage activities in Soviet airspace and the U.S. insistence on preventing the Four-Power Summit from taking place "once again confirm that peace cannot be begged from the imperialists. Peace must be striven for by the powerful forces of peace, the forces of the people of all countries. These events also confirm that the cause of peace is a real battle, and victory can only be won through the constant struggle of the people of all countries against the enemies of peace headed by the U.S. imperialists. In this struggle, there is no room for pity. It is extremely necessary to always be vigilant against the conspiracies of the enemies of peace."

The editorial also pointed out that all imperialists who are enemies of the people of the world are equally villainous. Although Britain and France have contradictions with the United States in this or that aspect, they both defended U.S. espionage activities at the Four-Power Summit and the United Nations Security Council meeting.

"Al Nida" also published an article today, condemning the Yugoslav revisionists for serving U.S. imperialism.

The article pointed out that Tito's recent speech on the Four-Power Summit, which generally attacked "great powers" without distinguishing between the Soviet Union and the United States, was to please the United States.

The article pointed out that after the U.S. government's aggressive acts were condemned by world public opinion, it attempted to exonerate itself and divert people's anger. Therefore, "Tito and those who follow his example are serving the United States under the guise of 'neutrality.' It is hard to believe that they are serving 'for free.'"

The article also said that the Yugoslav newspaper "Politika," in order to exonerate the U.S. thieves, even described the U.S. spy plane incident as a "trivial matter." The "Al Nida" article also emphasized that "Politika's" remarks were made when honest public opinion around the world was unanimously condemning the U.S. provocative acts.

    黎巴嫩“呼声报”发表社论指出
    争取和平必须依靠人民的斗争  对美帝国主义不能有任何幻想
    铁托集团以“中立”为名替美国开脱罪责
    新华社贝鲁特31日电　黎巴嫩“呼声报”今天发表社论，呼吁全世界各国人民加强争取和平的斗争，对帝国主义者、特别是对美帝国主义者不能有任何幻想。
    这篇以“赢得和平的战斗的道路”为题的社论说，最近美国在苏联领空进行间谍活动和美国坚持使四国首脑会议开不成等行为，“再一次证实了不能向帝国主义者乞求和平。必须由和平的强大力量、各国人民的力量来争取和平。这些事件也证实了，和平的事业是一场真正的战斗，只有通过各国人民同以美帝国主义者为首的和平的敌人的不断的斗争，才能赢得胜利。在这场斗争中，不容有一点怜悯。对和平的敌人的阴谋永远保持警惕，是极其必要的”。
    社论还指出，同世界各国人民为敌的一切帝国主义者都是同样为非作歹的。英国和法国虽然在这一方面或那一方面同美国有矛盾，但是它们在四国首脑会议上和联合国安全理事会会议上都为美国的间谍活动辩解。
    “呼声报”今天还发表文章，谴责南斯拉夫修正主义者为美帝国主义效劳。
    文章指出，铁托最近发表的关于四国首脑会议的讲话，笼统地抨击“大国”，而不把苏联同美国区别开来，这是为了取悦美国。
    文章指出，美国政府在它的侵略行为受到世界舆论的谴责以后，企图开脱罪责和转移人民的愤怒。因此，“铁托和那些学他样子的人以‘中立’为名替美国效劳。很难认为他们是‘免费’效劳的。”
    文章还说，南斯拉夫“政治报”为了替美国窃贼开脱罪责，居然把美国间谍飞机事件说成是“小事”。“呼声报”的文章还强调指出，“政治报”的这种话是在全世界正直的舆论都同声谴责美国的挑衅行为时说出来的。
