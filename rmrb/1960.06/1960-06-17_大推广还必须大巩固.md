    Large-Scale Promotion Must Be Accompanied by Large-Scale Consolidation
    When it comes to the promotion of all new technologies, especially major innovation projects, we must unswervingly persevere to the end. We must never regard a temporary success in promotion as the end of the matter and cease to grasp the consolidation work. Otherwise, the promotion of new technologies will suffer setbacks, even reversals, causing the achievements already made to be wasted and all previous efforts to be in vain.
    Any new thing, from its birth to its growth, needs a process of consolidation. To carry out technological innovation and technological revolution, we must promote a batch, consolidate a batch, and improve a batch; then promote another batch, consolidate another batch, and improve another batch. Only through such a cycle of ascent can technological innovation and technological revolution advance from one victory to another, and promote the continuous development of production. At the same time, it must also be recognized that the process of consolidating the achievements of technological innovation and technological revolution is the process of mutual adaptation between the relations of production and the productive forces, and the process of adapting the various parts of the superstructure to the rapid development of the productive forces. Therefore, all management systems that are not adapted to the current development of the technological revolution and the development of the productive forces, such as technical operations, planned quotas, labor organization, rules, and regulations, must be improved and adjusted in a timely manner to create conditions for the wide application of new technologies in all aspects.
    The growth of new things is irresistible, and so is new technology. Many new technologies immediately show that they are far superior to the old technologies and much more efficient. However, often because people have not yet mastered the performance of the new machines, have not yet figured out their rules, are not skilled in operation, are not accustomed to them, or even do not know how to use them, they are not as handy as the old tools, and the effect cannot be immediately displayed. In this case, is it to escape the difficulties with a passive and retreating attitude, or to solve the difficulties with a positive and enterprising attitude? Is it to go backwards, or to continue to move forward? This is a test for every innovator and every leading cadre, worker, and mass of the enterprise. The workers of the Qiligou Well of the Ximing Coal Mine of the Xishan Mining Bureau said it well: Mastering the coal-loading machine is like riding a bicycle. Compared with walking, it is of course much lighter and faster, but when you start learning, you will inevitably fall. If you are afraid of falling and do not actively learn, you will have to walk forever. Therefore, they gritted their teeth, made up their minds, studied hard, and practiced hard, and in a very short period of time, they completely adapted their thinking, habits, and working methods to the needs of using new tools; from not knowing how to operate to knowing how to operate, from being unskilled to being skilled. When they became skilled and accustomed to it, they changed from not wanting to use it to vying to use it, and finally became indispensable tools. Practice makes perfect. With the continuous improvement of operating skills, the great power of new tools has become more and more obvious, thus ensuring that the production plan is completed ahead of schedule every month, leading the way in the entire mine.
    The workers of Qiligou can unswervingly promote new tools, and there is another main reason, that is, there are many new workers in this well, the attendance rate is low, and if coal-loading machines are not used, the production efficiency will not increase significantly, and the production plan will be in danger of not being completed. This vividly shows that with the emergence and promotion of new technologies, labor organization and production quotas must be improved and adjusted accordingly. Chairman Mao said: Poverty gives rise to the desire for change, to work, to revolution. In the movement of technological innovation and technological revolution, the facts of many factories and mines have once again proved this truth. Enterprises with large tasks and a weak foundation have a greater impetus for technological innovation and do it faster; otherwise, it will be worse and slower. When a new technology appears and production efficiency is improved, but there is still so much labor and the quota is still so low, the masses may have an attitude of indifference towards new tools; because, not using them can also complete the production plan and achieve the production quota. This is especially true when people are not yet familiar with and accustomed to new technologies and have not mastered their rules. Timely adjustment of labor organization and resolute transfer of the saved labor force out of the original unit can promote the use of new tools, prevent idleness and waste; and, can supplement new production units and increase social productivity, killing two birds with one stone.
    The emergence of any new technology cannot be perfect. Therefore, the so-called consolidation does not mean that the new technology is not modified, but that it remains at the existing level forever; on the contrary, it is necessary to use the spirit of continuous revolution to creatively improve and improve it in the process of promotion and use in light of local conditions. It should be recognized that the process of consolidating and promoting new technologies is the process of continuous improvement and perfection of new technologies. In the technological innovation and technological revolution movement centered on "four modernizations," all walks of life have created many effective new technologies. How to quickly promote these new technologies, consolidate them all without losing one, and widely apply them to production has a very important significance for achieving a large increase in production in June and welcoming a big leap forward in July.

### 大推广还必须大巩固

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    大推广还必须大巩固
    对待一切新技术的推广，特别是重大革新项目的推广，必须坚定不移地一抓到底，决不能把一时推广成功，看作万事大吉，再不去抓巩固工作。否则，新技术的推广还会受到挫折，甚至走回头路，使已经取得的成果付诸东流，前功尽弃。
    任何新生事物，从产生之日起到成长壮大，都需要有一个巩固的过程。开展技术革新和技术革命，一定要推广一批，巩固一批，提高一批；再推广一批，再巩固一批，再提高一批。只有如此循环上升，才能使技术革新和技术革命从一个胜利走向另一个胜利，才能促进生产不断的向前发展。同时还必须认识，技术革新和技术革命成果的巩固过程，就是生产关系和生产力相互适应的过程，就是上层建筑各个部分适应生产力迅速发展的过程。因此，凡是与当前技术革命的发展，生产力的发展不相适应的各种管理制度，如技术操作、计划定额、劳动组织、规章制度等，都要作及时的改进和调整，从各个方面为新技术的广泛应用创造条件。
    新生事物的成长是不可抗拒的，新技术也是这样。许多新技术一开始就显示出它比旧技术要优越得多，效率要高得多。但往往由于人们还没有掌握新机器的性能，还没有摸清它的规律，操作不熟练，不习惯，甚至不会使用，用起来不如旧工具那样得心应手，效果便不能够立刻显示出来。在这种情况下，是以消极退缩的态度逃避困难呢，还是以积极进取的态度解决困难呢？是走回头路呢，还是继续前进呢？这对于每一个革新者和每个企业的领导干部、职工群众来说，都是一个考验。西山矿务局西铭煤矿七里沟井的工人说得好，掌握攉煤器跟骑自行车一样，它和步行走路比较起来，当然轻便得多，快得多，但开始学，免不了要跌跤，如果怕跌跤而不积极地去学，那只好永远步行走路。因此，他们咬紧牙关，下定决心，苦学苦练，在很短的时间里，就使自己的思想、习惯、工作方法完全适应了使用新工具的需要；由不会操作到会操作，由不熟练到熟练。熟练了，习惯了，就由不大愿意使用变为抢着使用，最后成为离不开的工具。熟能生巧，随着操作技术的不断提高，新工具的巨大威力也愈来愈明显地显示出来，从而保证了生产计划月月提前完成，在全矿遥遥领先。
    七里沟职工能够坚定不移地推广新工具，还有另一个主要的原因，就是这个井口新工人多，出勤率低，不使用攉煤器，生产效率就不能大幅度地增长，生产计划就有完不成的危险。这件事生动地表明，随着新技术的出现和推广，劳动组织、生产定额，必须相应地加以改进和调整。毛主席说：穷则思变，要干，要革命。在技术革新和技术革命运动中，许多厂矿企业的事实再一次证明了这条真理。任务大、底子薄的企业，技术革新就劲头大，搞得快；反之，就要差些、慢些。一项新的技术出现了，生产效率提高了，而劳力还是那么多，定额还是那么低，群众对待新工具，就可能产生用不用都可以的态度；因为，不使用也可以同样完成生产计划，同样达到生产定额。特别是人们对新技术还不熟练、不习惯，没有掌握了它的规律的时候，更容易如此。及时调整劳动组织，把节约的劳动力坚决调出原单位，就可以促进新工具的推广使用，防止窝工浪费；并且，可以补充新的生产单位，增加社会生产力，一举两得。
    任何新技术的出现，都不可能是完美无缺的。因此，所谓巩固，并不是说对新技术不加改动，而使它永远停留在现有的水平上；相反，要以不断革命的精神，在推广使用过程中因地制宜地创造性地加以改进和提高。应该认识到，巩固推广新技术的过程就是新技术不断提高的过程，不断完善的过程。在以“四化”为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动中，各行各业创造了许多行之有效的新技术，如何把这些新技术迅速地加以推广，一条不丢的统统巩固起来，广泛地运用到生产中去，对实现6月大超产，迎接7月大飞跃，有着十分重大的意义。
