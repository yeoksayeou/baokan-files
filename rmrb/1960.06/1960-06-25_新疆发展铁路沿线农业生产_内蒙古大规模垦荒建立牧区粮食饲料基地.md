    This newspaper reports that as the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway rapidly extends westward, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Party Committee is making every effort to strengthen leadership in agricultural production in counties and cities along the railway to ensure grain supply to these areas after the railway opens. The Party Committee is organizing large numbers of personnel and technical forces to support water conservancy construction and land reclamation in these areas, expanding the planting area of ​​grain crops, and striving for a more rapid development of agricultural production in the railway line regions this year.

    Currently, under the direct leadership of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, agricultural production along the railway line, extending over 1,000 kilometers from Hami in the east to Alashankou in the west, has transformed more than one million mu of barren land into arable land. Most of this land has been sown with spring wheat, corn, and sorghum. The grain planting area has increased by more than 31% compared to last year. Approximately 200 reservoirs, canals, and karez wells have also begun to store and transport water, providing a relatively sufficient irrigation source for the newly cultivated land. While vigorously reclaiming land, various regions along the railway line have also launched an over-plan planting campaign. The spring wheat sowing plan has been completed with an over-sowing of about 15%, achieving great results of county-by-county and commune-by-commune over-sowing.

    The main measures taken by the Autonomous Region Party Committee to promote agricultural production along the railway line are to organize Party committees and various departments at the autonomous region level to take responsibility for specific areas along the line, from sowing to grain storage; ensuring area and yield. During the spring sowing period, various departments transferred more than 1,500 cadres (including 48 department and bureau-level leading cadres) to form more than ten work groups, which went deep into the people's communes. Most of these cadres directly assumed leadership positions (deputy positions) in counties, communes, management districts, and even production teams, putting a "stake" at the grassroots level in the countryside. Currently, every commune and even production team in the seventeen counties and cities along the railway line has dispatched cadres participating in specific leadership. These cadres share the same life and labor with the masses, greatly encouraging the productive enthusiasm of the broad masses. Turpan County, which mainly grows economic crops such as cotton and grapes, has been working under the direct leadership of the Autonomous Region Party Committee to develop grain production and prepare for the opening of the railway. The enthusiasm of the masses is soaring. In half a year, they built eighty-eight karez wells and reclaimed 110,000 mu of wasteland, equivalent to five and a half times the amount of wasteland reclaimed in the same period last year.

    Through grassroots work, the vast number of cadres have not only directly supported agricultural production but also trained themselves. Many cadres, due to working and living with farmers, have been loved by the broad masses of commune members and have deepened their feelings for the working people.

    While strengthening grassroots leadership, the Autonomous Region Party Committee has also organized the region's major factories and enterprises to link up with the people's communes along the railway line, supporting the communes in developing production in terms of technical strength. During the spring ploughing, the factories and mines promptly supplied more than 5,000 double-wheeled double-share plows and 2,000 walking plows to the people's communes along the line. Now, in order to welcome the summer harvest, a large number of horse-drawn harvesters and sickles have been rushed to production and are being continuously transported to the rural areas along the railway line. While completing its production plan, the Urumqi Agricultural Machinery Factory supplied more than 200 horse-drawn harvesters it made over-plan to Turpan County, which is linked to it. An agricultural support team composed of more than 500 technicians from various factories and mines, carrying tools and materials, have gone to various counties to help the people's communes establish agricultural tool repair networks, and have all contracted the repair tasks of tractors and various agricultural tools during the busy agricultural season. At present, with the help of large factories, the people's communes in seventeen counties and cities along the railway line have mostly established their own agricultural tool repair stations, and the ranks of rural technicians have also grown rapidly.

    Xinhua News Agency reports that the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has launched a large-scale land reclamation campaign to expand the planting area of ​​crops and establish grain and feed production bases in pastoral areas. From the banks of the Ergun River in the northeast to the Alxa desert in the southwest, there are campsites for land reclamation expedition teams everywhere. At present, more than 6.73 million mu of wasteland has been reclaimed throughout the region, and more than half of the newly reclaimed land has been planted with crops.

    In the large-scale land reclamation campaign, there are both large-scale concentrated reclamation by state-owned, joint state-private farms and the large-scale decentralized reclamation by rural and pastoral people's communes. The Party Secretary of the Yongsheng Commune in Hanggin Rear Banner on the Hetao Plain led a land reclamation team of more than a thousand people, equipped with tractors, double-share plows, and walking plows. They set up camp on the south bank of the Wujia River, building river dams and dikes, forcing the Wujia River to change its course, and planting wheat and beans on the reclaimed 20,000 mu of wasteland. Under the slogan of "Increase one mu for every ten mu, increase ten mu for every hundred mu; reclaim one mu and plant one mu, sow as soon as the wasteland is reclaimed," farmers of all ethnic groups in Zhaowuda League have reclaimed more than 1.23 million mu of wasteland, excavated more than 110,000 mu of scattered open space, and sown 600,000 mu of early millet and millet.

    In addition to planting crops on newly reclaimed land, various places have also sown a large amount of feed and forage. Most of the more than 3.76 million mu of forage and feed sown this spring is newly reclaimed wasteland.

    新疆发展铁路沿线农业生产
    内蒙古大规模垦荒建立牧区粮食饲料基地
    本报讯　在兰新铁路迅速向西伸展的时候，中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会为了保证即将通车的铁路沿线各县市的粮食供应，全力抓紧铁路沿线各地农业生产的领导工作，组织大批人力和技术力量支援这些地区水利建设、开垦荒地，以扩大粮食作物播种面积，力争沿线地区今年的农业生产更迅速的发展。
    目前，在东起哈密西至阿拉山口的一千多公里铁路线上的农业生产在自治区党委的直接领导下，一百多万亩荒滩已经变为良田，其中大部已经播下春麦、玉米和高粱，粮食播种面积比去年增加了31％以上，约二百个水库、水渠和坎儿井也开始蓄水输水，为新垦耕地提供了比较充足的灌溉水源。在大力开荒同时，铁路沿线各地还展开超计划播种运动，春小麦以超播15％左右完成了播种计划，取得了县县超播、社社超播的巨大成绩。
    自治区党委抓铁路沿线农业生产的主要措施，是组织党委和自治区一级各部门在沿线按地区分片包干，一包到底，从播种一直包到粮食入仓；保面积、保产量。各部门在春播中就抽调出一千五百多名干部（包括四十八名厅、局长级领导干部）组成十多个工作组，深入到人民公社、其中大部分干部直接担任了县、公社、管理区以至生产队的领导职务（副职），一竿子插到农村最基层。现在铁路沿线十七个县市每个公社直到生产队各级都有下派干部参与具体领导。这些干部跟群众同生活，同劳动，大大鼓舞了广大群众的生产干劲。以棉花、葡萄等经济作物为主的吐鲁番县，为了发展粮食生产，迎接铁路通车，在自治区党委直接领导下，群众干劲冲天，半年兴修八十八道坎儿井，开荒十一万亩，相当于去年同期开荒的五倍半。
    广大干部通过基层工作，不仅直接支援了农业生产，而且锻炼了自己，许多干部由于与农民同劳动、同生活，受到广大社员的爱戴，加深了同劳动人民的感情。
    在加强基层领导的同时，自治区党委还组织了本区各主要厂矿和企业，分别与铁路沿线各人民公社挂钩，从技术力量方面支援公社发展生产。在春耕中，各厂矿及时向沿线各人民公社供应了五千多部双轮双铧犁，二千部步犁。现在，为了迎接夏收，又赶制成大批的马拉收割机、镰刀，正源源运往沿线农村。乌鲁木齐农机厂在完成生产计划的同时，把超计划制成二百多架马拉收割机供应同它挂钩的吐鲁番县。由各厂矿五百多名技术工人组成的农业支援队，携带着工具和材料，已分别下到各县，帮助人民公社建立农具修配网，并全部包下了农村大忙季节的拖拉机和各种农具的修理任务。目前，铁路沿线十七个县市的人民公社在大工厂的帮助下，大部建立了自己的农具修配站，农村技术工人队伍也迅速壮大起来。
    据新华社讯　内蒙古自治区展开大规模开垦荒地运动，扩大农作物种植面积，建立牧区粮食和饲料生产基地。从东北部的额尔古纳河畔，到西南部的阿拉善荒原，到处有开荒远征队的野营地。目前全区已经开荒六百七十三万多亩，一半以上新开荒地已经种上作物。
    在大规模开荒运动中，既有国营、公私合营农牧场的大面积集中开垦，又有农村牧区人民公社大量的分散开荒。河套平原上的杭锦后旗永胜公社，党委书记率领一支千余人的开荒队伍，配备着拖拉机、双铧犁和步犁，在乌加河南岸安营扎寨，筑拦河坝，打围堰，逼使乌加河改道，在开垦的两万亩荒地上种上了小麦和豆类。昭乌达盟各族农民在“十亩增一亩，百亩增十亩；开一亩种一亩，随开荒随播种”的口号下，已经开垦荒地一百二十三万多亩，挖掘零星空地十一万多亩，播种早谷、糜黍六十万多亩。
    各地除了在新开荒地上种植农作物以外，还播种了大量饲料和饲草。今春播种的三百七十六万多亩饲草饲料，大部分是新开垦的荒地。
