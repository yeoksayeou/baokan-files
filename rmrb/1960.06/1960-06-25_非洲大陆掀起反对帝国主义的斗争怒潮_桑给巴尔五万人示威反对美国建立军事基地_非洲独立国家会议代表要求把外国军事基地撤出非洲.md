Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd, Zanzibar News: 50,000 Zanzibaris held a demonstration in Raha Leo, Zanzibar on the evening of the 20th, opposing the establishment of a rocket base by the United States in Zanzibar.

At the demonstration, the Secretary-General of the Zanzibar Nationalist Party called on all Zanzibaris to unite and jointly thwart this American conspiracy. The conference issued an appeal to peace-loving people of all countries around the world, asking them to encourage and support the Zanzibari people's struggle against imperialism and warmongers.

This gathering is the prelude to a nationwide protest movement by the Zanzibari people against the establishment of a military base by the United States. A second demonstration will be held on July 10th in Tungu, where the U.S. is planning to establish the base. It is expected that more than 100,000 people will participate.

As previously reported, the U.S. and British governments have reached a secret agreement to build a rocket base in Zanzibar. This action by the imperialists has aroused opposition from all levels of Zanzibari society, and the protest movement is growing.

Xinhua News Agency, June 21st, Dar es Salaam News: At a recent meeting in Dar es Salaam, the capital of Tanganyika, the Unified Steering Committee of the Pan-African Freedom Movement of East and Central Africa strongly condemned the imperialist behavior of "establishing open military bases or bases disguised as scientific research centers" in Central and East Africa.

The committee guaranteed its support for the heroic stance of the Zanzibari people against the U.S. plan to establish a military base there, and expressed opposition to the British proposal to send hydrogen bomber planes to East Africa.

It is reported that the U.S. and British governments have reached a secret agreement to establish a rocket base in Zanzibar under the guise of establishing a "scientific research detection station." The Zanzibari people and the Zanzibar Nationalist Party resolutely oppose the establishment of military bases by U.S. and British imperialism on their territory.

The Unified Steering Committee meeting, which ended on the 19th, also passed a resolution condemning the colonialists' detention of African political leaders as a "flagrant violation of basic human rights." The resolution demanded the immediate release of political prisoners still being held in Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika, Ruanda-Urundi, the Belgian Congo, Northern Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia, Nyasaland, and the Union of South Africa.

Another resolution passed at the meeting called on the people of Central and East Africa to boycott all goods from the Union of South Africa to protest its policy of racial oppression against South African Africans.

The Pan-African Freedom Movement of East and Central Africa is an organization that unites nationalist movements in East and Central Africa. It was announced at the Mwanza Conference in Tanganyika in September 1958.

Xinhua News Agency, Addis Ababa News: The Second Conference of Independent African States ended its general debate on the 18th.

Some representatives who spoke at the meeting condemned France's colonial war in Algeria and called for the establishment of an African volunteer corps to fight for Algerian independence. Speakers also condemned the apartheid policy practiced by the Union of South Africa, military exercises conducted by colonialists on the borders of Central Africa and the Congo, and French nuclear explosion tests in the Sahara.

Speakers called for accelerating the economic development of African countries and uniting in the struggle against colonialism, for the complete liberation of Africa, and for strengthening world peace.

The proposal by Diallo (Guinea), Secretary-General of the All-African People's Conference, regarding the withdrawal of foreign military bases in Africa, was supported by the representatives. Diallo pointed out that imperialism "attempts to retain military bases in newly independent countries." He said, "For example, in the case of the Mali Federation, the French government insisted on agreeing to establish bases in Dakar, Thies, Saint-Louis, Bamako, and Tessalit before granting independence. The situation is similar in Bizerte in Tunisia, and in Morocco and Libya. French troops are stationed in Cameroon. There are British bases in Rhodesia and Kenya." Diallo pointed out that these bases are used to deal with African nationalism.

Xinhua News Agency, June 21st, Addis Ababa News: Some political parties and social organizations from Kenya, Angola, Southern Rhodesia, Southwest Africa, and the Union of South Africa distributed appeals to the Second Conference of Independent African States on the 20th, calling on the conference to further support their struggle for independence.

These appeals condemned the colonialists' brutal oppression of the people of these countries, the implementation of racial discrimination and armed suppression, and demanded an end to colonialist rule in Africa.

The Kenyan appeal called on the British colonial authorities to release Kenyatta and other political prisoners.

The Southern Rhodesian appeal pointed out that the racial discrimination practiced by the British colonialists in Southern Rhodesia is as bad as that of the South African government.

The Angolan appeal condemned the Portuguese colonialists for implementing a reign of terror, massacring the Angolan people, and prohibiting them from owning their own land.

It is reported that the Political Committee of the Second Conference of Independent African States is studying these appeals and will invite the appellants to express their opinions.
