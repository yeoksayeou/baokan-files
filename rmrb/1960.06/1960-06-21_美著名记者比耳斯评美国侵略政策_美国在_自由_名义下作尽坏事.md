Xinhua News Agency, June 18th: TASS, New York, June 16th: Prominent American journalist Beals, commenting on US President Eisenhower's forced cancellation of his visit to Japan, said: "America's various policies in Asia violate the world's reason, infringe upon the rights of various peoples, trample on human freedom, and mock the entire course of human history."

He emphasized: "All American policies in Asia are absurd, not only absurd, but also useless and tragic."

Beals continued: "The treaty imposed on Japan after the war, which ended with the inhuman bombing of the residents of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, not only repeated the mistakes the United States made in Cuba, but also repeated the mistakes of aggression against the Panama Canal, aggression against Nicaragua, Honduras, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and other republics… The Treaty of Peace with Japan, which plundered Okinawa, established permanent American bases in Japan, and forced Japan to separate from the Asian continent with which its fate is truly connected: all this is the result of the heinous conspiracy of Dulles, the robber of our time."

Beals also said that Eisenhower "betrayed his people and led them into the quagmire of reaction, and all this was done in the name of freedom. He betrayed his country and led it on the path of alliance with the darkest tyranny in the world." He condemned Eisenhower for wooing Franco and the Portuguese dictator Salazar, condemned Eisenhower for "attempting to impose a new system of enslavement on the Japanese people and attacking the government of the Cuban people," condemned him for "creating the U-2 aircraft invasion incident and undermining international law with this provocative incident." Beals emphasized that Eisenhower "may try his best to salvage the recently signed treaty with Japan regarding the continued American occupation of Japan, and he may even try his best to salvage the tottering Nobusuke Kishi government. But the anger of the Japanese people will grow and will become a storm that no force in the world can stop."

    美著名记者比耳斯评美国侵略政策
    美国在“自由”名义下作尽坏事
    据新华社18日讯　据塔斯社纽约16日讯：美国著名记者比耳斯就美国总统艾森豪威尔被迫取消对日本的访问发表评论说：“美国在亚洲的各种政策违背了世界的理智，侵害了各国人民的权利，蹂躏了人类的自由，嘲弄了人类历史的全部进程。”
    他强调说：“美国在亚洲的一切政策是荒谬的，不仅是荒谬，而且是无益的和悲惨的。”
    比耳斯继续说：“以对长崎和广岛居民惨无人道的轰炸而告终的战争结束之后，强加于日本身上的条约不仅是重犯美国在古巴所犯的错误，而且也重犯了侵略巴拿马运河、侵略尼加拉瓜、洪都拉斯、海地、多米尼加等共和国等错误……掠夺冲绳岛的对日和约，在日本建立美国的永久基地，强迫日本同和它的命运有着真正联系的亚洲大陆分割开来：这一切都是我们时代的强盗——杜勒斯罪恶阴谋的结果。”
    比耳斯还说，艾森豪威尔“出卖了自己的人民，并且引导他们走向反动的泥坑，而所有这一切都是在自由的名义下进行的。他出卖了自己的国家，引导它走上了同世界上最黑暗的暴政结盟的道路”。他谴责艾森豪威尔拉拢佛朗哥和葡萄牙独裁者萨拉查，谴责艾森豪威尔
  “企图把新的奴役制度强加于日本人民，并且攻击古巴人民的政府”，谴责他“制造了U—2型飞机侵略事件，并且以这种挑衅事件破坏国际法”。比耳斯强调说，艾森豪威尔“可能竭力挽救最近同日本签订的关于美国继续占领日本的条约，他甚至还可能竭力挽救摇摇欲坠的岸信介政府。但是日本人民的愤怒将日益增长，并将成为世界上任何力量也阻挡不住的风暴。”
