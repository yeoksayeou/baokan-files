Xinhua News Agency, June 17th, Seoul dispatch: According to Seoul Radio, the U.S. aggressor troops, along with South Korea, began a "landing exercise" in the Pohang area on the 14th, under the protection of the Air Force. Participating in the exercise were sixty warships, including the U.S. Seventh Fleet and the South Korean puppet navy, and approximately 17,000 naval personnel.

The report stated that this exercise was "exactly like real combat" and would continue until the day of Eisenhower's arrival in South Korea—June 19th.

The commander of the U.S. aggressor troops stationed in South Korea, Magruder, and the South Korean puppet Heo Jeong, observed the exercise.

This exercise, conveniently timed during Eisenhower's visit to the Far East, is another military provocation by the United States to create tension and intensify war preparations in the region.

Earlier reports stated that the U.S. aggressor troops headquarters in South Korea initiated a series of provocative "training exercises" starting on June 4th, placing the entire South Korean army on "alert status." According to the Hapdong News Agency, the U.S. aggressor troops and South Korea held "mine-sweeping exercises" on the sea near Pohang starting on the 6th. The South Korean puppet army stationed in the eastern region conducted "river-crossing exercises" near the military demarcation line on June 7th and 8th. The puppet army's ground forces held "alert training" on the 14th to examine their "combat readiness."

    为艾森豪威尔访问制造战争气氛
    美军在南朝鲜频繁演习
    新华社17日讯　据汉城电台报道，美国侵略军从14日起在浦项地区同南朝鲜联合举行在空军保护下的“登陆演习”，参加演习的有包括美国第七舰队和南朝鲜伪海军的六十艘军舰和约一万七千名海军人员。
    消息说，这次演习同“真的战斗一模一样”。将持续到艾森豪威尔抵达南朝鲜的一天——6月19日。
    美国驻南朝鲜侵略军总司令马格鲁德和南朝鲜傀儡许政观看了这次演习。
    恰巧在艾森豪威尔来远东时举行的这次演习是美国在这个地区制造紧张局势和加紧备战的又一次军事挑衅。
    早些时候有报道说，美国驻南朝鲜侵略军总部从6月4日起开始了一系列挑衅性的“训练演习”，使南朝鲜的全部军队处于“戒备状态”。据合同通讯社报道，美国侵略军和南朝鲜从6日起在浦项地区的海面上举行“扫雷演习”。驻在东部地区的南朝鲜伪军6月7日和8日在军事分界线附近举行“渡河演习”。伪军地面部队在14日举行“戒备训练”，以检查其“战斗准备”。
