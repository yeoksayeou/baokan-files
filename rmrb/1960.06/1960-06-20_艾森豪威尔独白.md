Eisenhower's Soliloquy
Guo Moruo

Chapter Three
The Soviet visit was cancelled, and the Japan visit was blown away.
Filipinos throw stones, the world's people are laughing.
Deterrence only creates the opposite effect, and people's hearts cannot be bought with money.
Today I've become a street rat, only wanting to crawl into a rat hole.
A bunch of lackeys are really muddleheaded, Menderes, Syngman Rhee, Chiang Kai-shek.
They only know how to reach out for U.S. dollars, but when things happen, they can't even block a single arrow.
It's not too late to change horses and fight again, learn from the Southern Dynasties and Turkey.
Replace the bedbugs and lice, there are plenty of flies and mosquitoes.
The "Free World" is not free, and the mask of peace is hard to conceal its ugliness.
Lifting a stone only to drop it on one's own feet, trying to draw a tiger but ending up with something resembling a dog.
With a straw label stuck on my back, parading through the East to make an example.
Originally wanted to organize Northeast Asia, but the robber brought it on himself.

Chapter Four
Suddenly hearing the roar of ten thousand cannons, shaking Jinmen and Taiwan.
The robber has a hard time standing firm after entering the door, angering the People's Liberation Army.
It turns out the robber's hand is long, stretching across the Pacific Ocean.
Grabbing Japan and South Korea, grabbing Taiwan and refusing to let go.
The robber's logic is said ten thousand times, but even a three-year-old child can hardly be fooled.
I am the biggest robber boss, known as the most shameless.
I am the god of plague reciting the Bible, I am the war demon talking about peace.
A wolf in sheep's clothing is still a wolf, and my heart trembles at the sound of cannons.
Coming on the 17th and leaving on the 19th, I have now become a drowning dog.
Specifically choosing odd dates, the cannon fire "welcome and send off" is most unbearable.
The "U.S. Embassy" has suffered disaster, and now I'm afraid of Alishan.
Raising my hands and sighing repeatedly, my ugly face is completely lost.

    艾森豪威尔独白
    郭沫若
    第三章苏联访问被取消，日本访问又吹了。菲律宾人投石块，世界人民都在笑。威慑只生反作用，人心用钱买不动。今天我成过街鼠，只想钻进老鼠洞。一批奴才真混账，曼德列斯李岸蒋。只解伸手要美元，事来一箭不能挡。换马再战不太迟，殷鉴南朝土耳其。换掉臭虫和虱子，苍蝇蚊子有的是。“自由世界”不自由，和平面具难遮丑。搬起石头自砸脚，画虎不成反类狗。插上草标在背上，鸣锣示众来东方。原想组织东北亚，强盗自讨没下场。
    第四章忽闻万炮齐轰鸣，震撼金马和台湾。强盗进门难站稳，激怒人民解放军。原来强盗手杆长，一伸伸过太平洋。抓着日本南朝鲜，抓着台湾死不放。强盗逻辑说万遍，三岁小孩也难骗。我是强盗大头子，数我第一不要脸。我是瘟神念圣经，我是战魔说和平。狼披羊皮还是狼，一闻大炮心胆惊。来是十七去十九，我今成了落水狗。偏偏选到单日期，打炮“迎送”最难受。“美国使馆”曾遭难，我今怕过阿里山。举起双手再三叹，我的丑脸已丢完。
