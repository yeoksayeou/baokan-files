Shenyang, June 21 (This newspaper dispatch) — Shenyang is vigorously promoting the experience of transforming employee collective dormitories into hotel-like accommodations. By the end of May, 112 employee collective dormitories throughout the city had been hotelized, allowing nearly 40,000 single employees to completely free themselves from the burden of daily life, gain more time for rest, study, and scientific and technical research, and powerfully promote production.
	Hotelization involves operating employee collective dormitories like hotels, establishing comprehensive service departments, equipping them with a certain number of service personnel, and adopting a service-to-person approach to manage employees' daily lives. This experience first appeared at the Shenyang Songling Machinery Factory. With the deepening development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movements, the production enthusiasm of the working masses soared to unprecedented heights, and they demanded more time to study science and culture, delve into production technology, and engage in recreational activities. In response to this situation, the Songling Machinery Factory, in cooperation with the Lingbei People's Commune, established a comprehensive service department in the employee collective dormitory, equipped it with full-time service personnel, and launched "Ten Major Services, Hundreds of Conveniences" service activities. They took care of employees' food, clothing, housing, and transportation, realizing the hotelization of employee collective dormitories. After this experience emerged, it immediately received the attention of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, which convened an on-site meeting and universally promoted it throughout the city.
	After the experience of hotelizing single dormitories was universally promoted throughout the city, service items continued to increase. These included purchasing daily necessities, making clothes, dismantling old clothes and renovating them, washing, mending, delivering boiling water, repairing shoes, handling savings deposits, buying books and periodicals, delivering letters, repairing fountain pens, cleaning the environment, caring for patients, and receiving relatives. The various comprehensive service departments also adopted a service-to-room-and-person approach, helping working employees clean their rooms, wipe windows, wipe floors, open windows for fresh air, and dry bedding. The employees were very satisfied with the service personnel's thoughtful care. They wrote poems praising: "The floor is shiny and bright, the glass is sparkling, the bedding is neat and clean, boiling water is delivered to the door, living in the employee dormitory is more comfortable than at home, we work harder in production, thank the Communist Party."
	Because they were freed from the distractions of daily life, employees had more rest time, more energy, and more guaranteed time for technical research and cultural learning. After hotelization, the three employee dormitories of the Songling Machinery Factory organized 55 Mao Zedong Thought study groups, with more than 450 participants; they also organized reading groups to regularly study current affairs. The employees happily said: "The commune is paradise, the dormitory is a study, the sound of reading is everywhere, everyone writes articles."

    沈阳推广集体宿舍旅馆化经验
    保证职工有充分的时间休息、学习、钻研技术
  本报沈阳21日电　沈阳市大力推广职工集体宿舍旅馆化的经验。到5月底全市已经有一百一十二处职工集体宿舍实现了旅馆化，使将近四万名单身职工彻底摆脱了日常生活琐事的牵累，得到了更多的休息、学习和钻研科学技术的时间，有力地推动了生产。
    旅馆化就是把职工集体宿舍办得像旅馆那样，建立起综合服务部，配备一定数量的服务人员，采取服务到人的办法，将职工的日常生活给管起来。这个经验首先出现在沈阳松陵机械厂。随着技术革新和技术革命运动的深入发展，职工群众的生产热情空前高涨，他们要求有更多的时间学习科学文化、钻研生产技术和进行文娱活动。根据这种情况，松陵机械厂在陵北人民公社的配合下，在职工集体宿舍里建立了综合服务部，配备了专职服务员，开展了“十大服务、百项方便”的服务活动。把职工的衣食住行包下来，实现了职工集体宿舍旅馆化。这一经验出现以后，立即受到中共沈阳市委的重视，并召开了现场会议，在全市进行了普遍推广。
    单身宿舍旅馆化的经验在全市普遍推广以后，服务项目又在不断增加。如代购日用品、承做衣服、拆旧翻新、浆洗缝补、送开水、修理鞋、代办储蓄、代买书刊、传递信件、修理金笔、打扫环境卫生、照顾病人、招待亲属等全包下来了。各综合服务部还采取服务到房间到人的办法，帮助上班职工清扫室内、擦玻璃、擦地板、开窗户换空气、晾晒被褥等。职工们对服务员这种周到的照顾非常满意。他们写诗称赞说：“地板光又光，玻璃亮堂堂，被褥整又洁，开水送到户，职工宿舍住，比家还舒畅，生产加油干，感谢共产党。”
    职工们由于摆脱了日常生活琐事的牵扯，休息时间更多了，精力更充沛了，钻研技术、学习文化的时间也更有保证了。松陵机械厂三栋职工宿舍，在旅馆化以后就组织起五十五个毛主席著作学习小组，参加学习的有四百五十多人；同时还组织了读报小组，经常学习时事。职工们高兴地说：“公社是天堂，宿舍是书房，到处读书声，人人写文章”。
