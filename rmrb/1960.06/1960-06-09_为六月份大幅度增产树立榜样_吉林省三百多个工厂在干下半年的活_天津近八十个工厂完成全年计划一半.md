Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 8th: In Jilin Province, 186 factories and mines, including Changchun Locomotive Factory, Jilin Chemical Industry Company's Calcium Carbide Plant, and Shulan Mining Bureau, have already completed their production value and output plans for the first half of the year ahead of schedule. 171 factories and mines, including Fengman Power Plant, have completed half of their annual national production value and output plans.

	Since entering May, workers on the industrial front throughout the province have launched a massive mass movement of "seizing materials, transporting efficiently, and ensuring high yield." Party committee secretaries at all levels took the lead, leading cadres went deep into the front lines of production, extensively mobilized the masses, and set off a new upsurge in increasing production and saving raw materials, resulting in a substantial increase in the output of major raw materials such as steel, wood, and cement compared to the same period last year.

	These factories and mines vigorously promoted, consolidated, and improved new experiences and technologies, engaged in diversified operations and comprehensive utilization, and increased new raw materials, which were important reasons for completing their plans ahead of schedule. Jilin Chemical Industry Company's Calcium Carbide Plant widely adopted new technologies and processes, learned from and promoted various successful advanced experiences, and quickly applied technological innovation achievements to current production, resulting in a situation of large savings in production raw materials and a large increase in production efficiency. The plant comprehensively completed all plans for output value, output, quality, and labor productivity in the first half of the year. Changchun Asbestos Factory vigorously engaged in the comprehensive utilization of raw materials and waste materials, increasing the utilization rate of waste materials from 30% to over 70%, and producing more than 60 tons of asbestos rubber sheets, asbestos boards, and 60,000 asbestos pads using waste materials. Jilin Fertilizer Plant vigorously engaged in the comprehensive utilization of waste residue, waste gas, and waste water, increasing more than 20 kinds of new raw materials and new products.

	Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 8th: Seventy-nine factories in Tianjin have completed half of their annual national production value and output plans. Currently, workers in these factories are focusing on taking measures to make June a month of substantial high yield.

	These factories pay special attention to closely integrating the technical innovation and technical revolution movements with current production, applying the achievements of technical innovation to solving key production problems, continuously overcoming weak links, and promoting continuous leaps forward in production. The workers of Tianjin Yangliuqing Power Machinery Factory, in the technical innovation movement, on the one hand, improved production capacity, and on the other hand, saved raw materials, increased the production of a large number of agricultural power machinery to support the peasant brothers, and completed more than half of the annual national plan by the end of May.

	The workers of these factories and enterprises are currently advancing victoriously. Leading cadres are going to the front lines of production, mobilizing the masses to adopt methods of large-scale inspection, large-scale summarization, large-scale evaluation, large-scale promotion, and large-scale improvement, and vigorously promoting new tools, new technologies, and new experiences in response to current production needs. Tianjin Agricultural Machinery Factory has to complete the task of 120 harvesters in June, and there are still difficulties in production capacity. The factory leaders went deep into the front lines of production and organized workers to summarize and promote new technologies and new processes. Efforts are being made to realize the mechanization of all fitter operations and the remote control of the third machine shop before the 10th, so that the problem of insufficient production capacity is basically solved.

    为六月份大幅度增产树立榜样
    吉林省三百多个工厂在干下半年的活
    天津近八十个工厂完成全年计划一半
    新华社长春8日电　吉林省已有长春机车厂、吉林化学工业公司电石厂、舒兰矿务局等一百八十六个厂矿提前完成了上半年产值、产量计划，有丰满发电厂等一百七十一个厂矿完成了全年国家产值、产量计划的一半。
    进入5月以来，全省工业战线的职工，开展了声势浩大的“夺材、高运、保高产”的群众运动。各级党委书记挂帅，领导干部深入生产第一线，广泛发动群众，掀起了增产节约原料材料的新高潮，使钢铁、木材、水泥等主要原料材料的产量，比去年同期有大幅度的增长。
    这些厂矿大力推广、巩固、提高新经验新技术，大搞多种经营和综合利用，增加新的原料，是提前完成计划的重要原因。吉林化学工业公司电石厂广泛采用新技术、新工艺，学习推广各种成功的先进经验，将技术革新成果迅速用于当前生产，出现了生产原料大节省、生产效率大提高的局面，全厂上半年的产值、产量、质量、劳动生产率等计划都已全面完成。长春石绵厂大搞原料材料和废料的综合利用，使废料利用率由30％提高到70％以上，利用废料生产出石绵橡胶板、石绵板等六十多吨和石绵垫六万个。吉林肥料厂大搞废渣、废气、废水综合利用，增加了二十多种新原料和新产品。
    新华社天津8日电　天津市有七十九个工厂完成了全年国家产值、产量计划的一半。目前这些工厂的工人正在大抓措施，决心使6月份成为大幅度高产月。
    这批工厂特别注意使技术革新和技术革命运动同当前生产紧密结合，把技术革新成果运用到解决生产关键问题上去，不断地克服薄弱环节，促使生产不断跃进。天津杨柳青动力机厂的职工在技术革新运动中，一方面提高生产能力，一方面节约原料材料，增产了大量农业动力机械支援农民兄弟，到5月底止就完成了全年国家计划的一半以上。
    这批工厂企业的职工目前正乘胜前进。领导干部们走上生产第一线，发动群众采取大检查、大总结、大评比、大推广、大提高的方法，针对当前生产需要，大力推广新工具、新技术、新经验。天津农业机械厂6月份要完成一百二十台割刈机的任务，在生产能力上还有困难，工厂领导干部就深入生产第一线，组织职工总结推广新工艺、新技术。力争在10日以前实现全部钳工操作机械化，机工第三车间操作遥控化等新技术，使生产能力不足的问题基本解决。
