Xinhua News Agency report: Sichuan Province is rapidly planting, extensively planting, and planting high-quality sweet potatoes. The province's sweet potato planting area has exceeded 14 million mu and is progressing at a rate of over one million mu per day.

Sweet potatoes are one of Sichuan's major food crops. This year, the planned planting area for sweet potatoes in the province accounts for nearly a quarter of the area for major spring grain crops. Due to recent droughts and water shortages in some paddy fields, there is a need to convert them to sweet potato planting, which further increases this proportion. To ensure good sweet potato production, cadres at all levels are going deep into the fields, working with the masses to plan land, arrange labor, and solve problems. The masses are full of confidence and high spirits, overcoming many difficulties. The supply of sweet potato seedlings is a prominent issue in the expansion of sweet potato planting. Cadres and the masses in various places have offered suggestions and provided many solutions. For example, Gulin County organized specialized teams to water the seedlings once a day and apply fertilizer every two days, cultivating them carefully, so that the seedlings grow more than an inch every day. Luxian County extensively planted direct-seeded "窝子苕" (sweet potatoes planted in nests), rapidly expanding the sweet potato seedling base. In Yibin, Luzhou, and other areas experiencing drought, dozens of drought-resistant sweet potato planting measures have been summarized.

Now, with the sweet potato planting season pressing, various places are planting quickly to ensure extensive planting, seizing time to ensure area, concentrating labor for a rush, and reforming tools and improving techniques to accelerate progress in every possible way. Nanchong Prefecture launched a vigorous high-efficiency competition, advancing simultaneously with post-rain rushes and drought-resistant planting, seizing sunny days and taking advantage of rainy days. It has now completed more than 85% of its planned area. After a recent rain, Xichong County mobilized 250,000 people, divided into specialized teams according to their expertise, and planted 120,000 mu of sweet potatoes in two days. The county's sweet potato planting plan has not only been overfulfilled, but it has also been completed a season earlier than last year. Some drought-stricken areas manufactured indigenous water pumps and various improved water-lifting tools to improve efficiency, save labor, and accelerate progress.

Various places are vigorously expanding planting areas, striving to fill every cultivatable piece of land. Mianyang Prefecture widely implemented intercropping and mixed cropping of sweet potatoes with corn, sorghum, and other crops. Other dryland crops were also appropriately converted to sweet potatoes, resulting in a 15% expansion of the sweet potato planting area in the entire region. Yibin County mobilized the masses to calculate accounts at each level, tapping potential and adopting measures such as converting dry land to sweet potato land and planning each plot of land, expanding the county's sweet potato planting area by 100,000 mu. Various places also fully utilized the experience of increasing planting of spring crops, planting many sweet potato hills, sweet potato bays, sweet potato ditches, and sweet potato roads by utilizing the areas in front of and behind houses, along field edges, and on barren slopes. After completing their planting plans, the masses in Pengxi County extensively planted "堆堆苕" (sweet potatoes planted in mounds) and "堆土种苕" (sweet potatoes planted by piling soil), planting more than 400 million sweet potato seedlings in a few days.

Various places are focusing on both extensive planting and high yields. Xichong, a well-known high-yield county, implemented eight technical reforms in the entire process from land preparation, ridge making, fertilization, dense planting, to sweet potato transplanting. Fushun County, based on local and external high-yield experiences, also made significant innovations in ten areas. Cadres at all levels in these two counties went deep into key areas, planted demonstration plots, provided layer-by-layer demonstrations, and imparted techniques, so that technical specifications were basically unified.

Xinhua News Agency report: From the 18th to the 20th, some areas of Henan Province experienced rainfall. These areas are seizing the favorable opportunity after the rain to rush plant late autumn crops.

The rainfall was centered south of the Shahe River and in the Huai River basin. In Xinyang and Nanyang Prefectures, except for a few counties, the rainfall was over 30 to 50 millimeters, with the largest reaching 164 millimeters. Wuyang, Lushan, and Ye Counties in Xuchang Prefecture, and Song County in Luoyang Prefecture, also received rainfall of over 20 millimeters. During and after the rain, these areas organized large numbers of laborers to rush plant late autumn crops. From the Dabie Mountains to the banks of the Huai River in Xinyang Prefecture, more than 1.76 million mu of various crops were planted in just three days. Nanyang Prefecture mobilized more than 2.95 million laborers, taking advantage of the moisture in the soil to rush plant rice and sweet potatoes on more than 580,000 mu. After the rainfall, Ye County adopted different measures for three different types of areas based on soil moisture conditions: areas with thoroughly moistened soil concentrated manpower and tools to rush plant; areas with semi-moist soil dug large pits, sealed moist soil, and vigorously rushed plant, while also taking measures to conserve moisture; and drought-stricken areas mustered even greater efforts to continue drought-resistant planting.

Various places are actively expanding the planting area and planting more high-yield crops during the rush planting. Nanyang Prefecture's counties have reclaimed 960,000 mu of barren land such as river beaches, sandy wastelands, and hillside slopes, and are doing so while preparing the land, applying fertilizer, and taking advantage of the moisture to rush plant high-yield crops such as sweet potatoes. Many communes and teams in Gushi, Guangshan, Shangcheng, and other counties in Xinyang Prefecture have launched a movement to fight for every inch of land after completing their planting plans. Chenlin Commune in Gushi County extracted 6,400 laborers to form specialized teams for expanding the planting area, launching a movement to increase grain production by 100 jin per person. Currently, more than 1,380 mu of rice have been planted on small pieces of land such as field embankments, pond edges, and fish-scale pits.

While rushing to plant, various places are also paying attention to water storage and conservation. Queshan, Xixian, Xinyang, Guangshan, and ten other counties launched a large-scale diversion, irrigation, and storage movement, filling more than 58,000 ponds and reservoirs and diverting water to irrigate 1.52 million mu of land in three days, ensuring that there is water for irrigation for a month of continuous drought.

Farmers throughout the province are seizing the time to carry out re-harvesting and re-threshing, striving to return every grain of food home.

    四川抢栽甘薯日进度突破百万亩
    南阳等专区有雨地区趁墒抢种　少雨地区继续抗旱播种
    据新华社讯　四川省正在快栽、多栽、栽好红苕（甘薯）。全省红苕栽种面积已突破一千四百万亩，正以日栽一百万亩以上的速度前进。
    红苕是四川主要的粮食作物之一。今年全省红苕计划种植面积占大春粮食作物面积近四分之一；由于最近部分地区稻田受旱缺水，需要改种红苕，就更加大了这一比重。为了抓好红苕生产，各级干部都深入田间，同群众一起规划土地，安排劳力，解决问题。群众信心十足，干劲高涨，许多困难迎刃而解。苕苗供应是红苕扩大种植中的一个突出问题，各地干部、群众献计献策，提供了许多解决办法。如古蔺县组织专业队，一天一浇水两天一追肥，精心培育，苕苗每天长一寸多。泸县大种直播的“窝子苕”，使苕苗基地迅速扩大。在发生旱象的宜宾、泸州等地，总结出了抗旱栽苕措施达几十条。
    现在，栽苕的时机紧迫，各地都快栽保多栽，抢时间保面积，集中劳力突击，同时改革工具，改进技术，千方百计地加快进度。南充专区开展热火朝天的高工效竞赛，雨后突击和抗旱抢栽同时并进，抓晴天、抢雨天，现在已完成计划面积85％以上。在最近一次雨后，西充县出动二十五万人，按特长分工组成突击队，两天就栽苕十二万亩。全县红苕栽种计划不仅超额完成，而且比去年提早了一个季节。部分受旱地区制造土抽水机和各种改良提水工具，提高工效，节省劳力，加快了进度。
    各地大力扩大栽插面积，力争把每一块能种的地都种满。绵阳专区广泛实行红苕和玉米、高粱等间种套种，其他旱地作物也适当改种红苕，结果全区红苕种植面积扩大了15％。宜宾县发动群众层层算账，挖潜力，采取改旱田为苕土、块块土地规划等措施，全县红苕种植面积也扩大了十万亩。各地还充分运用小春作物增种的经验，利用房前屋后、地边荒坡，见缝插针，种植了许多红苕山、红苕湾、红苕沟、红苕路。蓬溪县群众在完成栽种计划后，又大种“堆堆苕”、“堆土种苕”，几天内就种下了四亿多株红苕。
    各地都是既抓多种又抓高产。著名的高产县西充，从整地、开厢、施肥、密植到移栽红苕的全部过程实行了八项技术改革；富顺县根据本地和外地高产经验，也大闹十项革新。这两个县的各级干部又都深入重点，种指挥田，层层示范，传授技术，从而使技术规格基本上达到一致。
    据新华社讯　18日到20日，河南省部分地区降雨，这些地区正抓紧雨后有利时机突击抢种晚秋。
    这次降雨中心在沙河以南、淮河流域。信阳、南阳两专区除个别县外，降雨量都在三十到五十毫米以上，最大的到一百六十四毫米。许昌专区的舞阳、鲁山、叶县和洛阳专区的嵩县也降雨二十毫米以上，雨中和雨后，这些地区都组织了大批劳力突击抢种晚秋。信阳专区从大别山巅到淮河两岸，仅三天就抢种各种作物一百七十六万多亩。南阳专区各县出动二百九十五万多名劳动力，雨天趁墒抢栽水稻和红薯五十八万多亩。叶县在降雨后，根据墒情，对三种不同地区采取不同措施：透墒地区集中人力、工具，趁墒抢种；半墒地区挖大坑、封湿土，大力突击抢种，并做好保墒工作；干旱地区鼓足更大干劲，继续抗旱抢种。
    各地在突击抢种中，积极扩大播种面积和多种高产作物。南阳专区各县已经开垦河滩、沙荒、岗坡等荒地九十六万亩，并做到随开垦，随整地、施肥、随趁墒抢种红薯等高产作物。信阳专区的固始、光山、商城等县不少社、队，在完成播种计划后，又掀起了寸土必争的运动。固始县陈淋公社抽出六千四百名劳动力，组成扩大播种面积专业队，开展每人增种百斤粮运动。目前，已经利用田畈、塘边、鱼鳞坑等小片土地，扩大种植水稻一千三百八十多亩。
    各地在突击抢种的同时，还注意蓄水、保水工作。确山、息县、信阳、光山等十个县开展大引、大灌、大蓄运动，三天灌满塘、库五万八千多个、引水灌田一百五十二万亩，保证连续干旱一个月有水灌溉。（附图片）
