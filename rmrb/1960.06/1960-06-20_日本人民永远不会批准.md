    The Japanese People Will Never Approve

    Following the farce staged on May 19th, when the Kishi Nobusuke government of Japan forced a separate "vote" in the House of Representatives on the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," yesterday, amidst the unanimous protests of the Japanese people, it brazenly announced that this thoroughly aggressive military alliance treaty had been "naturally established." Chief Cabinet Secretary Etsusaburo Shiina of the Kishi Nobusuke government shamelessly stated at midnight on the 19th that he "felt very happy" that the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" had been "declared established." The U.S. State Department immediately issued a statement expressing its "satisfaction." Clearly, the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries believed that they could now rely on this disgraceful "treaty" to intensify their war deployment activities in the Far East and plot new war conspiracies. U.S. government officials even openly praised this criminal act of the Kishi Nobusuke government as "in some ways offsetting the loss of face he suffered when he was forced to cancel Eisenhower's visit to Japan."

    However, the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries are "happy" and "satisfied" too soon. The broad masses of the Japanese people have powerfully demonstrated with their earth-shattering, magnificent struggle that regardless of whether the Kishi Nobusuke government "approves" or not, whether it is "naturally established" or bandit-like self-proclaimed established, the Japanese people and public opinion have not approved this Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. The Japanese Communist Party solemnly declared that the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries' "approval" of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is completely invalid. It called on the Japanese people to strengthen their struggle, force the Kishi Nobusuke government to step down, dissolve the Diet, and smash the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. At the same time, the Japan Socialist Party issued a statement on the 19th, declaring that the "approval" of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is "invalid, illegal, and politically unreasonable." The Socialist Party does not recognize that this treaty has been "naturally established." Because this treaty has been strongly opposed by all strata of the Japanese people, it cannot be binding and cannot have power. The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan also announced that it cannot recognize that the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" has been "naturally established"; it will "devote all its efforts to the battle to smash the new 'Security Treaty'." The "National Council to Prevent the Revision of the Security Treaty" clearly pointed out that June 19th is not the day the "Security Treaty" was "passed," but will be the day of a national uprising to deliver a fatal blow to the "Security Treaty." The "National Council" decided to continue the struggle with the goal of demanding the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke government and the dissolution of the Diet. From the unprecedentedly fierce storm of struggle and the earth-shaking roar of anger that the Japanese people have launched in various parts of the country, it can be seen that the Japanese people firmly oppose the shameless collusion of the Kishi Nobusuke clique and U.S. imperialism to "approve" the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." The Japanese people have never approved the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. The Japanese people will never allow the "approval" of such a Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty that sells out the interests of the Japanese nation and endangers the peace of Asia and the world.

    The U.S.-Japanese reactionaries' conspiracy to impose the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, which symbolizes war disasters and the shackles of slavery, on the Japanese people is futile. The heroic Japanese people have been continuously persisting in a struggle for more than a year to smash the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries' conspiracy to plan a new war through the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. In this struggle, which is rising wave upon wave, people of all strata with different occupations and beliefs have unanimously shouted the slogans of opposing the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, overthrowing the Kishi Nobusuke traitorous government, and dissolving the Diet, and formed an increasingly broad and consolidated anti-U.S. patriotic united front. In this struggle, the Japanese People have become increasingly aware that the U.S. imperialist policies of aggression and war are the root cause of their suffering and unhappiness; people not only oppose the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, but also successfully disrupted Eisenhower's farcical "visit" to Japan, and demand the removal of U.S. military bases, the withdrawal of U.S. U-2 spy planes, and that the American imperialists get out! People have combined all these struggles, promoted each other, and developed together. In this struggle, the flames of the Japanese people's anti-U.S. and anti-Kishi struggle have spread from cities to rural areas, from the central government to local areas, and finally ignited across the country, illuminating the entire Japan from Hokkaido to Kagoshima, mobilizing the fighting strength of the entire nation. In this struggle, the number of people participating in unified action struggles has reached more than 20 million. The Japanese people, who have undergone profound training, not only are changing their mental outlook with unprecedented national pride, but also are changing the views of people around the world towards Japan with their spirited and unyielding actions, and are gaining the support of peace-loving people all over the world. It is certain that the Japanese people will continue their efforts, valiantly and unyieldingly continue the struggle, and achieve the final victory in smashing the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty in resolute and unyielding struggles. When the power of the Japanese people grows to the point where the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries find it increasingly difficult to resist, and when the Japanese people's anti-U.S. and anti-Kishi struggle develops more widely and deeply to the point where U.S. imperialism and their running dogs cannot find a foothold on the four islands of Japan, they will have no choice but to roll back to their old home on the other side of the Pacific.

    What imperialism headed by the United States and all reactionaries fear most is the awakening of the people. Because awakened people will always come up with all kinds of ways to expose their conspiracies and tie their hands and feet. Precisely because of this, in order to prevent the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries from further tying Japan to the U.S. war chariot, and in order to get rid of U.S. enslavement and control, the Japanese people will resolutely launch a broader mass struggle and awaken more people. The more widespread and in-depth this struggle is, the more it will make the situation of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries more difficult and more isolated, thereby greatly benefiting the struggle to finally defeat the conspiracies of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and benefiting the cause of defending peace in Asia and the world.

    The Kishi Nobusuke government's forced postponement of Eisenhower's "visit" to Japan has fully demonstrated that the conspiracies of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries can be defeated in the face of the powerful people's struggle. We are convinced that the closely united and awakened broad masses of the Japanese people, as long as they persist in their efforts unremittingly, will surely be able to turn the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" "approved" by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries into ashes with the flames of struggle!

    The Chinese people resolutely support the Japanese people's anti-U.S. patriotic just struggle. U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese people, and the running dogs of U.S. imperialism, including Kishi Nobusuke, are not only the vicious enemies of the Japanese people, but also the common enemies of the Chinese people and the peace-loving people of Asia and the world. In launching a more magnificent anti-U.S. patriotic just struggle, the Japanese people will surely receive the firm support of all the Chinese people and the peace-loving people of the world. The final victory will surely belong to the Chinese, Japanese, and all people who oppose U.S. imperialism and Japanese militarism, and the final defeat will surely belong to U.S. imperialism and its running dogs!

### 日本人民永远不会批准

    日本人民永远不会批准
    日本岸信介政府继5月19日演出强迫众议院单独“表决”新日美“安全条约”的丑剧之后，昨天又在日本人民举国一致的抗议声中，悍然宣布这项彻头彻尾的侵略性军事同盟条约已经“自然成立”。岸信介政府的官房长官椎名悦三郎，19日零点恬不知耻地表示新日美“安全条约”“宣告成立”而“感到很高兴”。美国国务院也立即为此发表声明，表示“感到满意”。显然，美日反动派以为从此他们可以凭借这见不得人的“条约”，放手加紧远东的战争部署活动、策划新战争的阴谋了。美国的政府官员们，甚至公开赞扬岸信介政府这种罪恶勾当“在某种程度上抵消了他被迫取消艾森豪威尔访日时所受到失面子的失败。”
    然而，美日反动派是“高兴”和“满意”得太早了。广大日本人民已经用他们雷霆万钧、气势磅礴的斗争，有力地表明：不管岸信介政府“批准”不“批准”，不管它是“自然成立”还是强盗般的自封成立，日本人民和舆论界并没有批准这个日美军事同盟条约。日本共产党庄严宣告，美日反动派“批准”新日美“安全条约”是完全无效的。它号召日本人民加强斗争，迫使岸信介政府下台、解散国会和粉碎日美军事同盟条约。同时，日本社会党19日发表声明，宣布新日美“安全条约”的“批准”是“无效的、非法的、在政治上是无理的”。社会党不承认这个条约已经“自然成立”。因为这个条约遭到日本各阶层人民的强烈反对，所以它不可能有约束力，也不可能有权力。日本工会总评议会也宣布，不能承认新日美“安全条约”已经“自然成立”；它将“全力投入战斗来粉碎新‘安全条约’”。日本“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”更明确指出，6月19日不是“安全条约”获得“通过”的日子，而将是给“安全条约”以致命打击的国民总奋起的日子。“国民会议”决定继续以要求岸信介政府下台和解散国会为目标展开斗争。从日本人民在全国各地接连掀起的无比猛烈的斗争风暴、发出震撼四岛的怒吼，可以看出日本人民坚决反对岸信介集团和美帝国主义“批准”新日美“安全条约”的无耻勾结。日本人民不曾批准过日美军事同盟条约。日本人民是永远不会容许“批准”这类出卖日本民族利益，危害亚洲和世界和平的日美军事同盟条约的。
    美日反动派阴谋把象征战争灾难和奴役枷锁的日美军事同盟条约强加到日本人民的头上，是徒劳的。英雄的日本人民为了粉碎美日反动派通过日美军事同盟条约策划新战争的阴谋，已经持续不断地坚持了一年多的斗争。在这场一浪高似一浪的斗争中，职业和信仰不同的各阶层人民，异口同声地喊出了反对日美军事同盟条约、打倒岸信介卖国政府、解散国会的口号，结成了日益广泛和巩固的反美爱国统一战线。在这场斗争中，日本人民越来越清楚地认识到，美帝国主义的侵略和战争政策是造成他们生活痛苦和不幸的总根源；人们不仅反对日美军事同盟条约，而且成功地打掉了艾森豪威尔“访问”日本的丑剧，并要求撤除美国军事基地、撤走美国U—2间谍飞机，要求美国佬滚回去！人们把所有这些斗争结合在一起，互相促进、共同发展。在这场斗争中，日本人民反美反岸的斗争烽火，由城市而农村、由中央而地方，终于燃遍全国，照亮了从北海道到鹿儿岛的整个日本，动员起全国人民的斗争力量。在这场斗争中，参加统一行动斗争的人数已经达到二千万以上。经受了深刻锻炼的日本人民，不仅以空前的民族自豪感改变着自己的精神面貌，而且以自己意气风发、坚毅不屈的行动，改变了世界各国人民对日本的看法，得到全世界爱好和平人民的支持。可以肯定，日本人民必将再接再厉，英勇顽强地不断斗争下去，在坚决顽强的斗争中取得粉碎日美军事同盟条约的最后胜利。当日本人民的力量壮大到美日反动派越来越难于抵抗的时候，当日本人民的反美反岸斗争更加广泛、深入地发展到美帝国主义和他们的走狗在日本四岛找不到安身之处的时候，他们就不能不滚回太平洋彼岸的老家去。
    以美国为首的帝国主义和一切反动派，最怕的就是人民的觉悟。因为觉醒的人民，总会想出各种各样的办法去揭破他们的阴谋、束缚他们的手足。唯其如此，日本人民为了制止美日反动派把日本进一步绑到美国的战车上，为了摆脱美国的奴役和控制，就一定会坚决发动更广泛的群众斗争，唤起更多的人们觉醒。这种斗争进行得越广泛、越深入，就越会促使美日反动派的处境更加困难、更加孤立，从而大大有利于最后击败美日反动派的阴谋的斗争，有利于保卫亚洲和世界和平的事业。
    岸信介政府被迫推迟艾森豪威尔“访问”日本的事件，已经充分表明：在强大的人民斗争面前，美日反动派的阴谋是可以被战胜的。我们确信，紧密团结起来的觉醒的广大日本人民，只要坚持不懈地作出努力，就一定能够用斗争的火焰把美日反动派“批准”的新日美“安全条约”化为灰烬！
    中国人民坚决地支持了日本人民的反美爱国正义斗争。美帝国主义是中日两国人民的共同敌人，美帝国主义的走狗包括岸信介在内的日本军国主义，不仅是日本人民的凶恶敌人，也是中国人民和亚洲、全世界爱好和平人民的共同敌人。日本人民在展开更壮阔的反美爱国正义斗争中，是一定会得到全中国人民、全世界爱好和平人民的坚决支持的。最后胜利的必将是中国、日本和所有反对美帝国主义和日本军国主义的人民，而最后失败的必将是美帝国主义和它的走狗！
