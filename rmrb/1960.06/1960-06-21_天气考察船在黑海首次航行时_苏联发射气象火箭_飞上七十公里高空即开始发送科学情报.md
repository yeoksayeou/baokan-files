Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 18th: A new Soviet weather observation ship, the "Yu. M. Shokalsky," has begun its maiden voyage and is launching meteorological rockets into the upper atmosphere over the Black Sea.

    These meteorological rockets begin transmitting scientific information about air temperature, pressure changes, and solar radiation effects after reaching altitudes of over 70 kilometers. The warhead, equipped with a parachute, detaches from the rocket at a predetermined altitude. Radar equipment aboard the ship tracks the rocket throughout its flight until the warhead splashes down in the sea.

    The "Yu. M. Shokalsky" was built at the Nikolayev Nosenko Shipyard. The ship can navigate for 120 days without docking. The rocket launcher is installed in the bow of the ship.

    This is the second Soviet weather ship built to the special order of scientists from the Hydrometeorological Service. The first was the "A. I. Voyeykov," which is currently sailing in the Pacific Ocean.

    During its trial voyage in the Black Sea, the "Yu. M. Shokalsky" will also conduct the same observations that are commonly carried out at all weather stations. This observation ship will soon sail to the Pacific Ocean to engage in scientific work.

    天气考察船在黑海首次航行时
    苏联发射气象火箭
    飞上七十公里高空即开始发送科学情报
    据新华社18日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科18日讯：苏联一艘新的天气考察船“尤·米·绍卡尔斯基号”开始了第一次航行，并且正在黑海发射一些气象火箭到大气高层中。
    这些气象火箭到达七十公里以上高空以后即开始发送关于空气温度、压力变化、太阳辐射作用的科学情报，带有降落伞的头部在规定高度上脱离火箭。在火箭头部坠入海里以前整个飞行期间，雷达装置一直从船上追踪着火箭。
    “尤·米·绍卡尔斯基号”是在尼古拉耶夫诺森科造船厂制造的。船可以不靠岸航行一百二十昼夜。火箭发射装置装在船的头部。
    这是根据水文气象机构科学家的特别订货建造的第二艘苏联天气船。第一艘是“亚·伊·沃耶伊科夫号”，目前正航行于太平洋上。
      “尤·米·绍卡尔斯基号”在黑海试航期间也将进行所有气象台一般都要进行的观测。这艘考察船即将驶往太平洋，从事科学工作。
