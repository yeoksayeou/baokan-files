    "Experimental Plots" Will Always Shine
    Chen Zhiyan
    Cultivating "experimental plots," a Marxist leadership method born in the Great Leap Forward, has proven to be a very good leadership method through two years of practice. Whether it is agriculture, industry, or other economic sectors, all those who regularly adhere to this leadership method can promptly identify problems and propose correct solutions in a timely manner, enabling production to develop wave after wave. One of the latest examples is the Tianjin No. 2 Steel Plant's five-level cadres joining forces at the furnace to run a "one-dragon" experimental plot, which has resulted in a continuous and steady increase in the daily steel output, with remarkable results.

    The reason why running "experimental plots" on a large scale in industrial production can promote production so quickly is that it is a concrete leadership method for implementing the mass line, and it is closely related to the fundamental system of proletarian management of enterprises, where workers participate in management and cadres participate in production. To run "experimental plots," it is certainly impossible to do so sitting in the office, but must go to the front line. When you get to the front line, it is impossible to do it just by relying on the leading cadres, but you must work with the workers and technicians. The power of the leadership and the power of the masses are combined on the front line, forming a huge attacking force against the key to production. When a shock brigade opens a breakthrough at one point, the entire team can advance mightily along the breakthrough. The advanced experience gained from the "experimental plots" has broken through the key obstacles to production, and the production of the entire workshop and the entire factory can be greatly improved.

    A sharp sword is often sharpened, and the more it is sharpened, the sharper it becomes. A good leadership method, if adhered to, becomes more and more effective. The leadership method of cultivating "experimental plots" in industrial production, a mass line method full of revolutionary scientific spirit, has already shone brightly in the Great Leap Forward of 1958 and 1959. Now, this leadership method is once again exerting its power in striving for a substantial increase in production.

    Let all enterprise leaders go to the production front lines to run "experimental plots" on a large scale, and let the "experimental plots" always shine!

    “试验田”永放光彩
    陈之衍
    种“试验田”，这个大跃进中诞生的马克思主义的领导方法，经过两年来的实践，证明这个方法确是一个十分好的领导方法。农业也好，工业也好，其它经济部门也好，凡是经常坚持使用这个领导方法的，就都能及时发现问题，并且能及时提出解决问题的正确办法，使生产一浪高一浪地向前发展。最新的事例之一，是天津第二钢厂五级干部会师炉前大办一条龙“试验田”，使钢的日产量连续稳定地步步上升，成效十分显著。
    在工业生产中大办“试验田”，所以能立竿见影地促进生产，是因为这是一个贯彻执行群众路线的具体的领导方法，它和工人参加管理，干部参加生产这个无产阶级办企业的根本制度息息相通。要办“试验田”，坐在办公室里当然是办不成的，必须到第一线去。到了第一线，光靠领导干部也是办不成的，而必须和工人、技术人员一起办。领导的力量和群众的力量在第一线上结合起来，就形成了一个对生产关键的巨大攻击力量。突击队在一个点上，打开了突破口，整个队伍就可以沿着突破口浩荡前进。从“试验田”中取得的先进经验，攻破了阻碍生产的关键，整个车间、整个工厂的生产也就能大幅度地提高了。
    宝刀常拭，越拭越锋利，好的领导方法坚持使用，越用越有效。在工业生产中种“试验田”这个群众路线的、充满着革命的科学的精神的领导方法，在1958、1959年的大跃进中已经放出了闪亮的光彩。现在，这个领导方法又在争取生产大幅度增长中发挥威力了。
    一切企业的领导干部都到生产前线去大办“试验田”，让“试验田”永放光彩！
