    Mountain Area Young Female Teacher Jia Guiying
    By our reporter Zhu Jigong
    Two years ago, seventeen-year-old Jia Guiying, under the leadership of the Party, founded the first community-run primary school in Yanqing County. This school has twice won the "championship" in the unified examinations of the entire school district, which people consider a miracle.
    How did this young girl manage to establish this school?
    In 1958—the first spring of the Great Leap Forward—Jia Huaiyu, the Party branch secretary of Xiaoguantou Village, discussed with her in the fields that, in response to the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to vigorously develop spare-time education, they wanted to establish a primary school in the village and asked Jia Guiying to be in charge. That year, Guiying had just turned fifteen and had only recently left school and taken off her red scarf. She kept asking herself, she was only a little taller than the children, could she really run a school? But she also thought that Xiaoguantou Village was located in a semi-mountainous area, with more than twenty households and over one hundred and forty people in the whole village. In the old society, the villagers lived in poverty, barely surviving on bran and wild herbs, and very few people went to school. Even writing a couplet required asking someone from another village. After liberation, schools were established near this mountainous area, and Jia Guiying's older brother was the first primary school graduate in the village (now studying at the county high school), and Jia Guiying was the second to attend senior primary school. She thought, it wouldn't do to not have culture when building socialism, she must listen to the Party and establish the school! The agricultural cooperative helped her find two tile-roofed houses to use as classrooms. In the beginning, there were no desks or chairs, and the village cadres actively supported her, helping her find wooden boards and desks and chairs with missing legs. Jia Guiying used discarded cement cylinders and wooden sticks to prop them up, hung up a blackboard, and posted slogans, making it look like a real classroom. This was the first community-run primary school in Yanqing County.
    Gradually, the number of children attending school increased to twenty-one. Jia Guiying divided them into four grades according to their level. At that time, the textbooks from Xinhua Bookstore had already been distributed to various schools according to the plan before the start of the school year. What to do without textbooks? "Copy!" Every night, Jia Guiying would start copying under an oil lamp. She was afraid that the children would not recognize cursive script, so she wrote each stroke like practicing regular script, copying one lesson after another. Late at night, she was so tired that her eyes ached and her hands hurt, and when she was sleepy, she would doze off on the table. Later, Jia Guiying felt that this method of copying was too inefficient, so with the assistance of the teachers at the Liubinbao Central Primary School, she cut stencils and used mimeographing to print out all the textbooks. The children were happy to have new books, and the classroom order was much better than before.
    The children needed paper to write. Jia Guiying first asked the children to ask their parents for money to buy it, and she also gave the students the paper she had left over from her own schooling. In the beginning, she sometimes asked the cooperative cadres for chalk and ink, and sometimes took the eggs her mother had saved up to the supply and marketing cooperative to sell, using the money from selling the eggs to buy some stationery. But these were only temporary solutions, not long-term plans. Branch Secretary Jia Huaiyu helped her think of ways to rely on her own efforts and work-study programs. At that time, it was the season when apricots were ripe, so after class, Jia Guiying led a group of older children up the mountain with baskets and empty schoolbags. In a few days, they picked up a large pile of apricot pits, and used the money from selling the apricot pits to buy chalk, ink, and new exercise books for the children. In the autumn, they also obtained the consent of the cooperative to pick up lost grains in the harvested farmland, and this money also lasted for several months. After that, the People's Commune was established, and money was allocated to the school on a monthly basis, so the funding problem was solved.
    Jia Guiying's path forward was not smooth sailing, and various unexpected difficulties awaited her. Some people satirized her over small matters, and her father also disagreed with his daughter becoming a "child king." When she encountered such situations, she remembered three things: First, at the graduation ceremony, the principal and teachers earnestly told her: "As long as you wholeheartedly do things for the people, the masses will definitely support you!"; Second, shortly after the community-run primary school was established, the branch secretary said that the community-run primary school was a concrete implementation of the Party's "walking on two legs" education policy. Community-run schools must be run well, and if they fail, the Party's prestige will be damaged; Finally, she remembered the labor model of this county, Hua Jixiang. Wasn't this young girl similarly ridiculed and mocked by backward masses when she first experimented with artificial insemination of sheep? However, Hua Jixiang finally succeeded. Thinking of these things, she strengthened her confidence in running the school. Whenever she had problems, she would go to the Party branch, and the Party often supported her and helped her solve difficulties.
    "To teach children well, it is impossible without teaching experience," Jia Guiying was determined to study hard. She went to her alma mater, Liubinbao Central Primary School, to attend classes. Every time, it took one and a half hours to travel back and forth from the village to the central primary school, and after class, she discussed some teaching problems with other teachers. During the rainy season, when the mountain streams were full, she would wade through the water barefoot. After insisting on attending classes for several months, Guiying learned how to prepare lessons and how to teach multiple grades at the same time, and her teaching performance improved significantly.
    As the saying goes, ten fingers are not equally long, and there were still a few naughty children in the class that made her feel very difficult. Eleven-year-old Jia Jingyi often went to the road to stop cars and play pranks. At first, Jia Guiying reasoned with them, and the children admitted it in person, but turned around and went to play again, and criticism was useless. She was determined to teach them well. She asked others for advice. Jia Jingyi had attended school in Liubinbao for two months, but later ran away on his own. The teacher who had taught Jia Jingyi told her that this child was very smart, had a strong personality, and if he could be educated properly, he would definitely be a good student. She also asked Liang Jingshun, the teacher with the longest teaching experience in the entire school district, for advice. Teacher Liang said: "Just criticizing will make the child 'tired'. You must grasp the child's characteristics. You might as well use his strengths to overcome his weaknesses." Jia Guiying was greatly inspired. Once, she found that Jia Jingyi was particularly serious and active in the labor of cleaning the classroom, so she praised him in the class: "Jingyi does the best work, from now on, let you be the labor captain!" After that, this child's labor became even more outstanding. The teacher asked: "You don't stop cars or scold people now, and you are very active in labor. There is still one thing that is not good enough, do you know?" The child stuttered: "Homework—not doing it properly." The teacher said again: "Since you know your shortcomings, make up your mind to change them. Only by studying well in all aspects can you be a good student of Chairman Mao!" Not long after, one day, the students all went home to eat, only Jia Jingyi was still doing exercises. Guiying was very surprised. Jingyi said to her: "I want to finish my homework before eating!" This was an unprecedented novelty. Jia Jingyi not only changed at school, but also became much more well-behaved at home, doing his homework before playing every day; before leaving home in the morning, he also helped his mother clean the house and take care of his younger sister. One day, Jingyi excitedly said to Jia Guiying: "Teacher, my mother said I have completely changed!" These words made Jia Guiying's blood boil. Education had finally worked. Every child not only studied well, but was also very active in labor. At the end of 1958, the unified examination of fifteen primary schools in the entire school district showed that Xiaoguantou Village had a total average score of 81.3, and was rated as first place. All the junior primary school graduates were promoted to senior primary school, and all the other students were also promoted to the next class. This battle was a successful start. This fact not only greatly shocked all the teachers in the mountainous area, but even the "skeptics" who originally thought that a young girl could not run a primary school said to Jia Guiying: "I am convinced by you!"

    山区青年女教师贾桂英

    两年前，十七岁的姑娘贾桂英，在党的领导下，创办起延庆县第一所民办小学，这所民办小学连续两次在全学区的统一考试中获得“冠军”，被人们认为是一个奇迹。
    这个小姑娘，她是怎样办起来这所学校的呢？
    1958年——大跃进的第一个春天，小观头村党支部书记贾怀玉在田里和她商量，响应党中央和毛主席大办业余教育的号召，要在村里办个小学，就要贾桂英负责。那年，桂英刚满十五岁，离开学校摘下红领巾不久。她不断地口问心，自己比孩子们高这么一丁点儿，要开办学校，行么？但她又想到，小观头村地处半山区，全村二十多户一百四十多口人，在旧社会，老乡们生活困苦，糠菜糊口，上学念书的人真是凤毛麟角，写副对联也得到外村去求人。解放后，这山区附近兴办了学校，贾桂英的哥哥是全村第一个高小毕业生（现在县立中学念书），第二个上高小的就是贾桂英了。她想，建设社会主义没有文化，可不行，一定要听党的话，把学校办起来！农业合作社帮助她找到两间瓦房作课堂，开头没有桌子、椅子，村干部都积极支持她，帮助找来了木板和缺腿的桌椅。贾桂英用被废弃的洋灰筒、木棍把它们支架起来，挂起了黑板，贴了标语，真像个课堂的样子了。这就是延庆县第一所民办小学。
    渐渐地，上学的孩子增加到二十一名了。贾桂英根据他们的程度，分成了四个年级。那时，新华书店的教科书，已经在各校开学前按计划发售完了。没有课本怎么办呢？“抄！”每当夜晚，贾桂英就在一盏油灯下，动手抄起来。她怕孩子们认不得连笔字，只好像练小楷那样一划一竖地写，抄完一课又一课。夜深了，她累得眼酸手痛，困了，伏在桌上打盹。后来，贾桂英觉得这样抄效率太低，她就在刘斌堡中心小学教师们的协助下，刻腊板，用油印的办法把教科书全部赶印出来。孩子们拿着新书，欢欢喜喜，课堂秩序也比以前好多了。
    孩子们写字需要纸。贾桂英先是让孩子们向家长要钱买，她也把自己上学时剩下的纸给学生用。开始时，她上课用的粉笔、墨水，有时向社干部要，有时把她娘积攒下的鸡蛋拿到供销社去卖，用卖鸡蛋的钱买点文具用品。但这都是暂时的办法，不是长久之计。支部书记贾怀玉帮助她从自力更生、勤工俭学方面想办法。当时正是杏熟的时候，贾桂英课后便领着一帮大孩子提着篮筐、空书包上山去，几天工夫，她们拣了一大堆杏核，用卖杏核得来的钱买了粉笔、墨水，还给孩子们添了新作业本。秋后，她们又征得了社里的同意，到收获过的庄稼田里拣丢失的杂粮，这笔钱也用了几个月。这以后，人民公社成立了，按月拨钱给学校，经费问题也就解决了。
    贾桂英在前进的道路上，也不是一帆风顺的，各种意想不到的困难在等待着她。有人借一点小事讽刺她，她父亲也不同意闺女去当什么“孩子王”。遇到这样情况，她就记起了三件事：第一件，在毕业典礼会上，校长和老师们的谆谆嘱咐：“只要你全心全意为人民做事，群众一定会支持你的！”；第二件，民办小学刚办起来不久，支部书记说过，民办小学校是具体贯彻党的“两条腿走路”的教育方针。民办学校只许办好，要是垮了，党的威信就会受到损害；最后，她想起了本县的劳动模范花季香，这位年轻姑娘刚试验绵羊人工授精的时候，不是同样受过落后群众的讽刺、挖苦吗，然而花季香终于胜利了。想到这些事，她坚定了办学的信心。有事她就去找党支部，党经常为她撑腰，帮她解决困难。
    “要教好孩子，没有教学经验是不行的”，贾桂英下决心要好好学习。她就到母校——刘斌堡中心小学去听课。每次从村里到中心小学往返要一个半小时，听完课又向其他老师谈一些教学上的问题。逢到雨季，山水满山沟，她就光脚涉水过去。这样坚持几个月听课之后，桂英学会了备课，学会了几个年级交叉进行教学的方法，教学成绩有了显著的提高。
    俗话说，十个指头不一般齐，班上还有个别调皮的孩子使她感到很棘手。十一岁的贾景义常常到公路上去，拦车，恶作剧。起初，贾桂英同他们讲道理，孩子们当面承认，一转身又去玩，批评也不顶事。她下决心要把他们教好。她便向人请教。贾景义曾在刘斌堡上过两个月的学，后来自动地跑了，曾经教过贾景义的老师告诉她，这孩子很聪明，个性要强，能教育过来准是个好学生。她又去请教全学区教龄最长的梁靖顺老师，梁老师说：“光批评，孩子反而‘疲’了，要抓住孩子的特点，你不妨用他的优点去克服他的缺点。”贾桂英得到很大启发。有一回，她发现贾景义在打扫课堂的劳动中特别认真、积极，就在班上表扬他：“景义劳动得最好，今后就让你做劳动队长！”以后，这个孩子的劳动就更出色了。老师就问道：“你现在不拦汽车，也不骂人，劳动挺积极，还有一件事不够好，你知道不？”孩子吞吞吐吐地：“作业——不好好地做。”老师又说：“你既然知道自己的缺点，下决心改，全面学好才是毛主席的好学生呢！”不久，有一天学生们都回家吃饭去了，只有贾景义还在做习题。桂英很奇怪，景义对她说：“我要做完作业才吃饭！”这是从未有过的新鲜事。贾景义不仅在学校转变了，在家里也安分得多了，每天回家先做功课再玩耍；早晨离家前，还帮着娘打扫屋子，照看小妹妹。有一天，景义兴冲冲地对贾桂英说：“老师，娘说我完全变啦！”这句话使贾桂英混身的热血在沸腾，教育到底起了作用了。个个孩子不仅学习好，劳动也很积极。1958年年底，全学区十五个小学统一考试，小观头村总平均得八十一点三分，被评为第一名。初小毕业生全部升入了高小，其他学生也都升了班。这一仗旗开得胜了。这个事实不仅使山区所有的教师们大为震惊，连原先认为黄毛丫头办不成小学的“怀疑派”也都对贾桂英说：“我算服了你了！”
