Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, June 11th: Henan Province's summer grain and oilseed purchase work is gradually unfolding from south to north. As of June 2nd, the province had stored 86.88 million jin of grain and 3.6 million jin of rapeseed.

In the purchase work, all parts of the province conscientiously implemented the spirit of "combining purchase, distribution, and living arrangements, and doing a good job at the same time." Before the summer crops were harvested, Party committees at all levels dispatched cadres to the grassroots level to work with commune and team cadres and member representatives to focus on investigating wheat growth, estimating yields, and formulating preliminary plans for purchase, distribution, and living arrangements, so that the masses had a clear understanding. As soon as the crops matured, the people's communes immediately harvested, thrashed, dried, distributed, sold, and transported the grain into storage. After accounting, the Guan Village Brigade of the Ciba Commune in Jia County had tens of thousands of jin of reserve grain left after reserving enough rations, seeds, and feed according to national standards and completing the sales tasks. Therefore, the members were very enthusiastic about production and selling grain. In the past few days, the grain they sold to the state accounted for more than 23% of the sales task.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, June 11th: Hubei Province, which has achieved a bumper harvest of summer crops, has fully implemented the grain purchase policy at all levels of Party committees, strengthened leadership at all levels, and the vast rural commune members are very enthusiastic about selling grain. The progress of summer grain purchases in the province is much faster than in the same period last year. As of June 4th, more than 30% of the summer grain purchase task had been completed in the whole province. The Xiangyang Special District, which has the largest summer grain area, had completed 59% by June 8th.

In the purchase process, all localities fully implemented the policy, ensuring that purchases and reserves were combined, completed in seasons, settled at one time, and sufficient rations, seeds, and feed were reserved. The commune members are very satisfied with this approach, happily harvesting, thrashing, drying, distributing, selling, and transporting grain.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, June 11th: Summer grain has generally been harvested in various parts of Anhui Province. The people's communes have established various specialized teams to connect harvesting, thrashing, drying, transporting, and selling into a single line, accelerating the progress of harvesting and selling new grain. As of June 1st, more than 60 million jin of new grain had been stored in the area south of the Huai River, greatly exceeding the same period last year. At the same time, the people's communes in the province had also sold more than 37 million jin of rapeseed by June 5th.

Inspired by the bumper harvest of summer grain, the broad masses of Anhui Province are very enthusiastic about selling grain. Many areas have adopted the method of being busy with production during the day and delivering grain in the early morning and evening. The Qunli Brigade of the Cuozhen Commune in Feidong County prepared the grain and transportation tools to be sold during the day, mobilized members to deliver grain in the evening, and exceeded the summer grain sales task by 5% in three nights. In the purchase work, all localities have paid attention to taking into account the interests of the state, the collective, and the members, and have reserved sufficient rations, seeds, and feed, which has been deeply supported by the masses.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, June 11th: Hebei Province, a major wheat-producing area, has made preparations for summer grain purchases. In the Handan area, where wheat was harvested earlier, more than 400 production teams have completed the plan to sell grain to the state. More than 330,000 storage rooms have been repaired throughout the province.

In order to complete the summer grain purchase task in a faster, better, and more economical way, various regions are organizing specialized teams for harvesting, thrashing, drying, and selling. In view of the heavy summer work tasks this year, the drought, and the concentrated wheat ripening, many regions have improved their work methods, organized direct transportation, improved efficiency, accelerated harvesting and storage progress, and reduced the transit time and consumption of grain delivery.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, June 11th: Amidst frequent reports of bumper harvests of summer crops, people's communes in various parts of Guizhou Province have successively sold grain and oil to the state.

As of June 4th, 53% and 44% of the province's wheat and rapeseed purchase tasks had been completed respectively. The Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture has completed the wheat purchase task ahead of schedule; in addition, 22 counties and cities including Pingba and Anshun have overfulfilled the wheat or rapeseed purchase tasks respectively. The quality of the grain and oil that has been put into storage meets the national standards; about half of it has been directly transported to the state warehouses along the transportation lines at one time.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, June 11th: Fujian Province has completed the harvesting of barley, wheat, and rapeseed, and is stepping up purchases. People's communes and production brigades in various places are striving to achieve rapid harvesting, thrashing, drying, selling, and transportation. Putian County overfulfilled the county's wheat purchase and storage task in just four days. The communes and brigades in Minqing County organized specialized teams to thrash and dry during sunny days, and overfulfilled the county's barley and wheat purchase tasks in two days. All localities have also closely combined purchase with grain distribution, management, and use, and have run public canteens well, so that the members can live better and have greater enthusiasm for production.
