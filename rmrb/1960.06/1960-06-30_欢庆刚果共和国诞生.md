In recent times, one piece of good news after another has been coming from the African continent about the anti-colonialist struggles of its peoples, with one country after another declaring independence. And today, the Republic of the Congo, one of the largest countries in Black Africa, has been born. This significant victory for the Congolese people will be a tremendous encouragement to the people of all African countries and all oppressed people around the world; and it cannot but be a major blow to imperialism and colonialism. The Chinese people cheer the birth of the Republic of the Congo and are excited that the Congolese people are embarking on the path of independent development. Our Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Premier Zhou Enlai, and Foreign Minister Chen Yi have respectively sent telegrams to the national leaders of the Republic of the Congo, expressing the heartfelt and warm congratulations of the 650 million Chinese people to the Congolese people.

The independence of the Congo once again proves that the revolutionary movement of oppressed nations against imperialism and colonial oppressors is bound to rise, and is independent of the subjective wishes of the imperialist reactionaries. Just over a year ago, Western colonialists were shamelessly boasting that the Congo was a "paradise for Black Africans" and a "model colony"; they even boasted that the Congolese people living in this "paradise" were "singing praises" to the Western colonialists, and therefore, despite the anti-colonial flames that had long been burning in North Africa, this was a so-called "stable oasis" and a time of peace and prosperity for the colonialists. However, the great rise of the Congolese people's anti-colonial struggle completely shattered this absurd myth of the "Western civilization" propagators. Eighty years of Western colonial rule brought to the Congo: foreign monopoly capital extracting staggering profits from the Congo every year; the Congolese population plummeting from 30 million to 12 million; the colonizers, who accounted for only 1% of the population, monopolizing 46% of the Congo's entire national income; hunger and poverty threatening the vast majority of the Congolese people, with infant mortality rates as high as 50%; prisons and concentration camps tormenting thousands of Congolese patriots.... Since such a sinful colonial oppression system objectively existed, there would naturally be a national revolutionary movement to resist this colonial oppression; and the colonialists could not dream of any "stable oasis." The Congolese people demand to control their own destiny, and the people of all African countries, Asia, and Latin America demand to control their own destiny. It is an irresistible historical trend for all the oppressed and enslaved people of the world to rise up and fight against imperialism.

The independence of the Congo was by no means "bestowed" by the Belgian colonialists, but the result of the long and heroic struggle of the Congolese people. The Congolese people are a heroic and unyielding people. For eighty years, they have fought for the independence of their motherland, one after another, unceasingly. In particular, because the colonialists needed to exploit the Congo and created a relatively large working class, this greatly promoted the development of the Congolese national independence movement and accelerated its maturation process. The Léopoldville riots in January 1959 finally caused the volcano under the colonialists' feet to erupt. Although the Belgian colonialists carried out barbaric suppression and massacres of the Congolese people, the blood shed by the Congolese patriots turned into immense anger and strength for the Congolese people, so much so that the imperialists had to cry out in alarm to "prevent a second Algeria." After the suppression proved ineffective, the Belgian colonialists resorted to political deception, making false promises of "reforms" and "independence in stages," etc. At the time, the American "Newsday" revealed that the Belgian colonialists' so-called "reform program" showed that they intended to maintain at least "twenty years" of colonial rule in the Congo. The result? The colonialists' "twenty-year" dream went bankrupt, and the Congolese people were not paralyzed by the colonialists' sweet talk; they continued to struggle. It is evident that the colonialists will never retreat automatically. The Congolese people only won their current independence by relying on a broad united front of patriotic forces opposing colonialism and by relying on a heroic and tenacious mass struggle.

The victory of the Congolese people is undoubtedly of great significance, and it will inevitably further influence the national independence movements of the countries of Black Africa south of the Sahara. Look, are not the British and Portuguese colonialists terrified by the independence of the Congo? Two weeks before the Congo's independence, the colonial government of the Central African Federation hurriedly sent troops to the border between the Congo and Northern Rhodesia to prevent "trouble." And the colonialists in Lisbon are already viciously cursing the new Congo. They fear that the people of Portuguese Angola will rise up to fight, and they ridiculously scold the Congo as "imperialist," and threaten that "Portuguese troops" will "assume their obligations." The editorial in Lisbon's "Jornal do Commercio" on June 4th wrote: "When a neighboring house catches fire, our only hope is to take appropriate measures to prevent it from spreading to our house." However, neither sending more colonial troops nor shameless curses can stop the people of the Black African countries from moving towards independence. As early as January 10, 1959, the British "Economist" magazine admitted that "the Congo can no longer be seen as a solid dam between the nationalism of the north...and Rhodesia and the Federation (of South Africa) to the south." Now that this colonial dam has been breached, the day of the total collapse of the imperialist colonial system in Africa is getting closer.

Of course, the declaration of independence of the Congo does not mean that the Western colonial forces will obediently withdraw from the Congo from now on, let alone that the task of the national revolution of the Congolese people has ended. The Belgian colonialists have by no means given up their ambition to continue their multifaceted colonial control over the Congo. The Belgian colonial army has not yet withdrawn; through the so-called Belgian-Congolese Economic Round Table Conference, the Belgian colonialists plotted to maintain their colonial control over the Congo economically; in politics, the Belgian colonialists are doing everything possible to carry out divisive conspiracies, creating divisions within the Congolese national independence movement, so that they can restore their colonial rule in the Congo in some disguised form. And what should be particularly pointed out is that an independent Congo has not only not yet been freed from the great scourge of the Belgian colonial forces, but also faces a great threat from British, French, and especially American imperialism. After World War II, American colonial forces massively infiltrated the Congo, and American investment in the Congo has reached 600 million U.S. dollars, second only to Belgium; American imperialism maintains aggressive military bases in the Congo, frantically plundering strategic resources, and almost all of the Congo's uranium ore is shipped to the United States. The head of American imperialism, Eisenhower, once said: "I really cannot understand, what will we do without the Congo?" And with the independence of the Congo, American imperialism is stepping up its colonial expansion of the Congo in order to replace the past position of the Belgian colonialists and put new colonial shackles on the Congolese people. In addition, British, French, and other imperialists are also stepping up their activities to undermine the independence of the Congo. The American "Daily Telegraph and Morning Post" recently admitted without concealment: "Several countries are watching the Congo's huge resources and are waiting for the lottery to be won." Therefore, it is very clear that the independence of the Congo is an important first step for the Congolese people on the road to independent development. In the days to come, the Congolese people will still face a serious and arduous task, that is, to continue to oppose colonialism, especially American neo-colonialism, in order to continuously maintain and develop national independence.

The Chinese people have always regarded the just struggle of the people of all African countries as our own struggle, and every victory of the people of all African countries as our own victory. We believe that the victory achieved by the Congolese people in the anti-colonial struggle is also a support and encouragement for the Chinese people. As pointed out in the congratulatory telegram from our Premier Zhou Enlai: "The Chinese government and the Chinese people have always warmly sympathized with and resolutely supported the just struggle of the Congolese people for national independence. I am deeply convinced that the friendship established between the Chinese and Congolese peoples in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism will be increasingly developed and consolidated."

### 欢庆刚果共和国诞生

    欢庆刚果共和国诞生
    最近以来，非洲大陆各国人民反殖民主义斗争的捷报频传，一个接着一个的国家宣告了独立。而今天，黑非洲的一个幅员最广大的国家——刚果共和国宣告诞生了。刚果人民的这一个重大胜利，对于非洲各国人民和全世界一切被压迫人民都将是极大的鼓舞；而对于帝国主义和殖民主义则不能不是一个重大的打击。中国人民为刚果共和国的诞生而欢呼，为刚果人民从此走上独立发展的道路而兴奋。我国刘少奇主席、周恩来总理和陈毅外交部长已分别致电刚果共和国的国家领导人，表达了六亿五千万中国人民对刚果人民的衷心的热烈的祝贺。
    刚果的独立再一次证明，被压迫民族反对帝国主义和殖民压迫者的革命运动是必然要兴起的，是不以帝国主义反动派的主观愿望为转移的。一年多以前，西方殖民者还在那里恬不知耻地吹嘘说刚果是什么“非洲黑人的乐园”，是“模范殖民地”；他们更吹嘘说，住在这座“乐园”里的刚果人民对于西方殖民者是
  “歌功颂德”的，因而尽管北非早就燃起了反殖民主义的烈火，这里却是殖民者所谓的“安定的绿洲”，太平盛世。然而，刚果人民反殖民主义斗争的伟大的兴起，彻底地揭穿了“西方文明”传播者的这种荒诞的神话。八十年的西方殖民统治带给刚果的是：外国垄断资本每年从刚果攫取惊人的利润；刚果的人口从三千万锐减到一千二百万；仅仅占人口1％的殖民者垄断了刚果整个国民收入的46％；饥饿、贫困威胁着广大的刚果人民，婴儿死亡率高达50％；监狱和集中营折磨着成千上万的刚果爱国者……。既然客观上存在着这种罪恶的殖民压迫制度，那末，当然就会有反抗这种殖民压迫的民族革命运动；殖民者也就休想有什么“安定的绿洲”。刚果人民要求把命运掌握在自己的手里，非洲各国人民、亚洲和拉丁美洲的一切被压迫的人民都要求把命运掌握在自己的手里。全世界一切被压迫、被奴役的人民起来进行反对帝国主义的斗争，这是不可抗拒的历史潮流。
    刚果的独立，绝不是比利时殖民者所“赐予”的，而是刚果人民长期英勇斗争的结果。刚果人民是英勇不屈的人民。八十年来，他们为了祖国的独立，前仆后继，抗争不息。特别是由于殖民者为了掠夺的需要在刚果造成了比较庞大的工人阶级队伍，这就大大地推动了刚果民族独立运动的发展和促进了它的成熟过程。1959年1月利奥波德维尔的暴动终于使殖民主义者脚下的这座火山爆发了。尽管比利时殖民者对刚果人民进行了野蛮的镇压和屠杀，但是，刚果爱国志士们洒下的热血化成了刚果人民的巨大愤怒和力量，以至帝国主义者不得不惊呼要“防止第二个阿尔及利亚”了。在镇压无效以后，比利时殖民者继之以政治上的欺骗，许下什么“改革”和“分阶段独立”等等的虚伪的诺言。当时美国“新闻日报”就曾透露过，比利时殖民者的所谓“改革纲领”说明它至少还要在刚果保持
  “二十年”的殖民统治。结果呢？殖民者的这个“二十年”的梦想破产了，刚果人民并没有被殖民者的花言巧语所麻痹，他们继续进行了斗争。由此可见，殖民者是绝不会自动退却的，刚果人民只是依靠了广泛的反对殖民主义的爱国统一战线，依靠了英勇顽强的群众性的斗争，才赢得了现在的独立。
    刚果人民的胜利无疑地是具有十分重大的意义的，它将不可避免地对撒哈拉以南的黑非洲各国的民族独立运动进一步发生影响。请看，由于刚果的独立，英国殖民者和葡萄牙殖民者不是惊恐万状了吗？中非联邦的殖民政府在刚果独立前两星期慌忙把军队开到刚果和北罗得西亚的交界处去，以防止“闹事”。而里斯本的殖民主义者已经在恶毒地咀咒新刚果了，它们害怕葡属安哥拉人民起来斗争，竟可笑地辱骂刚果为“帝国主义”，并且以“葡萄牙的军队”将
  “承担自己的义务”相威胁。里斯本的“新闻日报”6月4日的社论写道：“当邻近房子失火时，我们唯一希望能采取适当措施不让它蔓延到我们的屋子里来”。但是，不论是增派殖民军队也好，无耻的辱骂也好，都不能阻止黑非洲各国人民走向独立。早在1959年1月10日，英国
  “经济学家”周刊就承认，“刚果已不再能被看成是北面的……民族主义和南面的罗得西亚与
  （南非）联邦之间的巩固的堤防了”。现在这个殖民主义的堤防已经决口，帝国主义在非洲的殖民体系总崩溃的日子更加临近了。
    当然，刚果的宣告独立，并不意味着西方殖民势力从此会乖乖地退出刚果，更不意味着刚果人民的民族革命的任务已经结束了。比利时殖民者绝没有放弃继续在刚果进行其多方面殖民控制的野心。比利时的殖民军队还没有撤退；通过所谓比—刚经济圆桌会议，比利时殖民者策划了从经济上保存其对刚果的殖民控制的阴谋；在政治上，比利时殖民者更千方百计地进行着挑拨离间的阴谋，制造刚果民族独立运动内部的分裂，以便它以某种变相的形式，恢复它在刚果的殖民统治。而特别应该指出的是，一个独立的刚果不仅还没有摆脱比利时殖民势力的巨大祸害，而且还面临着英国、法国，尤其是美国帝国主义的巨大威胁。第二次世界大战以后，美国殖民势力大举渗入刚果，美国在刚果的投资已达六亿美元，仅次于比利时而居第二位；美帝国主义在刚果保有着侵略性军事基地，疯狂地掠夺战略资源，刚果的铀矿砂几乎是全部运往美国的。美帝国主义的头子艾森豪威尔就曾说过：“我真不能理解，如果没有刚果，我们将怎么办？”而随着刚果的独立，美帝国主义正加紧它对刚果的殖民扩张，以便取代比利时殖民者过去的地位，把新的殖民枷锁套在刚果人民的身上。此外，英、法等帝国主义也在加紧活动，以破坏刚果的独立。美国“每日电讯与晨邮报”最近直认不讳地供认：“好几个国家都在注视着刚果巨大的资源，并且正在等待着彩票中奖”。因此，事情很明白，刚果的独立，是刚果人民在独立发展的道路上跨出了重要的第一步。在今后的日子里，刚果人民还面临着严重而艰巨的任务，即继续反对殖民主义，尤其是美国新殖民主义，以不断地维护和发展民族独立。
  中国人民一向把非洲各国人民的正义斗争看作是我们自己的斗争，把非洲各国人民的每一个胜利看作是自己的胜利。我们认为，刚果人民在反殖民主义斗争中所取得的胜利，也就是对中国人民的支持和鼓舞。正如我国周恩来总理的贺电中所指出：“中国政府和中国人民一贯热烈同情和坚决支持刚果人民争取民族独立的正义斗争。我深信，中、刚两国人民在反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争中建立起来的友谊，必将日益发展和巩固”。
