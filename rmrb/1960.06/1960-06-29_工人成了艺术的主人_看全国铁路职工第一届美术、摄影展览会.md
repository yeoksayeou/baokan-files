    Workers Become Masters of Art
    ——On the First National Railway Workers' Art and Photography Exhibition
    Zhuang Yan
    The "First National Railway Workers' Art and Photography Exhibition" recently held in Beijing is a great review of the railway workers' art creation activities since the founding of the People's Republic (and also in the history of Chinese railways). The paintings, woodcuts, and sculptures in the exhibition felt very fresh and attractive. I was very excited to see these excellent artistic creations of the worker comrades and lingered in front of the paintings. As an art worker, I would like to talk about some of my thoughts on the exhibited art creations.
    The more than 500 art works exhibited, through various art forms, enthusiastically praised the brilliant achievements of the people's railway construction under the leadership of the Party, and portrayed the advanced deeds and heroic figures of our brilliant era. The biggest characteristic of workers' creation is their boundless love for their labor and their lofty ideals for the cause they are engaged in. Their creations come from the intense excitement of production labor, life, and struggle. Therefore, their works are closely related to the working masses and can produce great encouragement and educational effects.
    Many works focus on depicting the vast world of people's railway construction. I seemed to be riding the latest type of locomotive, and in a very short time, I had already galloped across the country and visited the "First Yangtze River Bridge," "Forest Small Railway," and "New Line Survey to the Miao Area." I saw "Heroic Drivers," "Technical Innovation Experts," and workers "Assembling New Locomotives." I saw "Transportation Dragon," here is "Expansion," there "Another New Factory." I visited "Steel Mansion" and walked into "Night University"... On this side, the sound of machines shook the valley, and on the other side, the fire illuminated the world. Truly, there are thousands of railways, stretching across thousands of miles. With heroic feelings, they richly and diversely painted a thriving scene of socialist construction for us, bringing us into a real realm. How can we not be excited by this boiling era!
    Under the guidance of the Party's literary and artistic policy, the heroic spirit of the working class in building socialism and the spirit of selfless labor have become our main creative themes. The image of workers is portrayed with more vitality in the creations of worker comrades.
    Railway workers have great ambitions,
    Fear no difficulties,
    Drawing ten thousand dragons with one stroke,
    Spreading their wings and soaring all over the world.
    This is a poem inscribed on a propaganda poster in the exhibition. It echoes the picture and reveals the workers' ambition and the spirit of daring to think and daring to do. This treatment makes this propaganda poster, which expresses the desire to spread railways all over the country, more artistically appealing. The Chinese painting "First Yangtze River Bridge" by train driver Fu Zhiming has a magnificent composition and a powerful momentum. The entire picture makes people feel like they are driving a train straight into the bridge tunnel, and the expression method is very novel. He Hongsheng's sculpture "Three Combinations" has a very realistic portrayal of the workers' image, vividly depicting the spirit of workers' research in the technical innovation movement. Who would believe that the author is actually a fitter who has never studied sculpture for a day? Other works, such as the oil painting "Heroic Driver," which expresses the communist style of selflessness, the oil painting "Trial Production of New Locomotives," which cleverly arranges the relationship between new and old contrasts, as well as the Chinese painting "Fengsha Spring Dawn," the woodcut "Struggle to Welcome Liberation," "Carnival," and the large papercut "Urban People's Commune," are all carefully crafted works. From here, we can see the authors' wisdom and rich creative talents.
    While describing our great era, the railway workers also painted the epic of the railway workers' heroic struggle against the reactionary rulers in old China. The oil paintings "Flames Thousands of Miles," "February 7th Storm Suite," as well as factory history illustrations, suites, and comic strips, explain the path of struggle taken by the railway workers and highlight that the leadership of the Party and the unity of the working class are the fundamental guarantees for victory. These paintings make us think about the past and look at today, and they have very important educational significance.
    Only in our socialist era is it possible for worker comrades to learn political, cultural, and scientific and technological knowledge, and only then do they have the opportunity to carry out creative artistic activities and give full play to their talents in all aspects. Isn't the achievement already made here surprising and exciting? We should proudly say that the workers have become the masters of art.
    All the authors of the exhibits in this exhibition have never studied art specifically; even the art workers who do professional art work in clubs and cultural palaces are selected from among the workers. Under the cultivation and education of the Party, and with the enthusiastic guidance of artists, they have gradually matured and become art vanguards in construction through serious, conscientious, and diligent study. Among them are workers of various types, fitters, lathe workers, welders, communication workers, and even clerks, police officers, and sports cadres... Despite this, the participants in this exhibition are only a part of the more than 4,000 art activists in the country. This huge art team shows that a widespread mass art activity has been launched among railway workers. This also makes us more convinced that the development of mass art has unlimited prospects.

    工人成了艺术的主人
    ——看全国铁路职工第一届美术、摄影展览会
    庄言
    最近，在北京举行的“全国铁路职工第一届美术、摄影展览会”，是建国以来（也是中国铁路有史以来）铁路职工美术创作活动的一次大检阅。展览会中的画、木刻、雕塑，使人感到很新鲜，很吸引人。我看到了职工同志们这些优秀的艺术创造，十分激动，站在画的前面以至流连忘返。我是一个美术工作者，只就展出的美术创作谈谈我的一些感想。
    展出的五百余幅美术作品，通过多种多样的艺术形式，热情地歌颂了在党的领导下人民铁路建设事业的辉煌成就，刻划了我们这个灿烂时代的先进事迹和英雄人物的形象。工人创作的最大特点是：对自己的劳动无限地热爱，对所从事的事业抱有远大的理想。他们的创作，正是由于生产劳动、生活、斗争的强烈激动而来，因此他们创作的作品，和工人群众息息相关，能产生很大的鼓舞力量和教育作用。
    不少作品，都集中地描绘了人民铁路建设的广阔天地。我仿佛乘着最新型的机车，在很短时间里，已经驰骋全国，游览了“长江第一桥”、“森林小铁道”、“新线勘测到苗区”，我看到了“英雄司机”、“技术革新的土专家”和“装制新机车”的工人，我看见“运输一条龙”，这儿是“扩建”，那儿“又一座新厂”，我参观了“钢府”，走进“夜大学”……。这边是机声震山谷，那边是炉火照天地，真是铁路千条，纵横万里。他们用豪迈的感情，丰富而多样地为我们画出了蓬蓬勃勃的社会主义建设景象，把我们带进一个真实的境界，我们怎能不被这个沸腾的时代所激动呢！
    在党的文艺方针指导下，工人阶级在建设社会主义中的英雄气概，和忘我的劳动精神，已成为我们的主要创作题材。工人的形象在工人同志们的创作中刻划得更富有生命力。
    铁路工人志气大，
    什么困难都不怕，
    一笔画出万条龙，
    展翅飞腾遍天下。
    这是展览中一张宣传画的题诗，和画面交相辉映，显露出工人们的雄心壮志和敢想、敢干的精神。这样处理，使这幅表现要把铁路铺遍全国的宣传画更加具有艺术魅力。火车司机傅智明同志画的国画“长江第一桥”构图宏伟，气势磅礴，整个画面使人感到像自己驾驶着列车，直向桥洞奔来，表现方法很新颖。何洪生的雕塑“三结合”，工人形象的塑造非常逼真，维妙维肖地刻划出了技术革新运动中工人钻研的精神。谁会相信，作者竟是一位钳工，没有学过一天雕塑而作出来的作品。其他如表现舍己为人的共产主义风格的油画“英雄司机”，巧妙地安排了新旧对比的关系的油画“试制新型机车”，以及国画“丰沙春晓”、木刻“斗争迎解放”、“狂欢”，大刻纸“城市人民公社”等，都是精心的作品。从这里我们可以看到作者们的智慧和丰富的创造才能。
    铁路职工们在描写我们这个大时代的同时，也画下铁路工人在旧中国向反动统治者进行英勇斗争的史诗。油画
  “火焰千里”、“二七风暴组画”及工厂史插图、组画、连环画等，为我们阐述了铁路工人走过的斗争道路，突出了党的领导和工人阶级的团结一致是取得胜利的根本保证。这些画让我们想想过去，看看今天，是有很重大的教育意义的。
    只有我们社会主义时代，工人同志才有可能学习政治、文化和科学技术知识，才有机会进行创造性的艺术活动，充分发挥他们在各方面的才能。这里已经做出的成绩，不正是使人们惊喜而又激动么？我们应该自豪地说，工人已经成了艺术的主人。
    参加这个展览会的展品的所有作者，都不曾专门学过美术；即使在俱乐部、文化宫作专业美术工作的美术员也是从工人中选拔出来的。他们在党的培养和教育下，有的在美术家的热心辅导下，经过严肃、认真、刻苦地学习，逐渐成熟，逐渐成为建设中的美术尖兵。其中有各个工种的工人，钳工、旋工、电焊工、通信工，甚至还有收发员、民警、体育干事……。尽管如此，参加这次展出的还只是全国四千多美术积极分子中的一部分。这支庞大的美术队伍表明，在铁路职工中，已经掀起广泛性的群众美术活动。这也使我们更坚信：群众艺术的发展，前途无限。
