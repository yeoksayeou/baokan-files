    Must Fight to the End
    Shí Fēng
    There is an old Chinese saying: "A cornered beast will still fight." It illustrates a simple truth. Wild beasts want to eat people, and before they are killed, even if they are surrounded or injured, they will still struggle desperately. If they have the opportunity, they will grab, bite, and eat people. So, what should people do when faced with a cornered beast? There is no other way than to not give the beast the slightest chance to breathe, and to fight it to the end until it is killed.
    We compare imperialism and all reactionaries to wild beasts because they represent the interests of the most barbaric, reactionary, and cannibalistic monopoly capital in modern society. This determines their bestial nature, determines the laws of their activities, and determines their set of bestial philosophies. Aesop's Fables has a wonderful analogy: a rooster arguing with a vicious cat is pointless. No matter what reasons the rooster has to defend itself, the vicious cat can still use a distorted reason to eat the rooster. The vicious cat has its own philosophy: "I can't go without food all the time." Imperialists and all reactionaries, in fact, also follow this logic. If imperialism does not invade, exploit, or oppress others, wouldn't the oil tycoons and arms dealers have nothing to eat? If the Eisenhower government cannot make big money and seek huge profits for the American bosses, what would the bosses want him for! Of course, the imperialist elements are far less naive than the cat in Aesop's Fables. They will not tell the truth, but rather prettify it as "maintaining the security of the free world." The essence is the same. Under the guise of so-called "security," they act recklessly, openly rob and secretly steal, engage in sabotage, and subversion, committing all kinds of evil. Regarding these bandit acts, Eisenhower confessed after the Soviet Union shot down the American spy plane, saying that this was the "national policy" of the United States! This needs no further explanation. In a word, it thoroughly exposes the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism.
    Of course, the current situation of U.S. imperialism is not like that of a smug vicious cat, but rather a cornered beast. After the world's peaceful forces have fought it many times, it has become increasingly isolated and embarrassed. This forces it to play some clumsy tricks in order to cover up its true purpose of expanding armaments and preparing for war, talking emptily about "peace" and "negotiations" and other sweet words, and sticking a few peacock feathers on a crow. It seems that Eisenhower has been quite complacent about his disgusting acting skills in recent years. A solo performance is naturally boring, and accompaniment is essential. Yugoslav modern revisionists play this shameful role. In order to help its "benefactor" out of its predicament, it faithfully puts makeup on U.S. imperialism, saying that the nature of imperialism has changed, as if U.S. imperialism has laid down its butcher knife and become a Buddha on the spot. But can this deceive anyone?
    "We say 'imperialism is very ferocious' means that its nature cannot be changed. Imperialist elements will never lay down their butcher knives, nor can they become Buddhas, until their demise." ("Comment on the White Paper") Even if they fail, they will not change their nature. Comrade Mao Zedong summarized the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries as follows: make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until their demise. This is the truth that reflects objective laws. Imperialism is not imperialism if it does not make trouble. Of course, there are many ways to make trouble, including real guns and knives, and "singing operas in civilian clothes"; sometimes it will show its ferocious nature in a fit of rage, and sometimes it will hide its true colors, put on a smiling face, and even pretend to be pitiful. But the essence remains the same, for the purpose of creating international tension, which is convenient for the big bosses to make a fortune. The reason why they pretend to be dead or put on a smiling face after failure is nothing more than to win a chance to breathe, heal their wounds, and then pounce on the revolution one morning and strangle it. The Chinese people are most familiar with this trick of U.S. imperialism. A female commune member in the suburbs of Shanghai said it well: "U.S. imperialism says all the nice things, but does all the bad things, speaking sugar from its mouth, but drawing a knife from its waist." These few vivid words of this worker reveal the most essential thing about U.S. imperialism.
    So what should we do? Against a cornered beast struggling to the death, we can only fight back with fight, and fight even harder. They have all kinds of troubles, and we have all kinds of struggles. They make trouble to the end, and we fight to the end. But one thing must be made clear: we firmly struggle against imperialism, but we do not imagine that it can lay down its butcher knife through struggle. This is unrealistic. Who expects a wild beast to turn into a white rabbit after fighting many times? That is harmful naivety! There is a foreign saying, "A rabbit learns to strike a match after being beaten a few times." But a wild beast can never become a rabbit in its lifetime. Cornered beasts must be punished, and feigning death beasts must be guarded against even more. Those who were afraid are no longer afraid; those who had illusions are now vigilant. Everyone sees the laws of activity of imperialism clearly. Everyone rises up to fight it, so that the beast has no more chickens to deceive, and no more food to steal. The lifespan of the beast will not be very long.

    必须斗争到底
    拾风
    我国有句古话：“困兽犹斗”。它说明了一个朴素的真理。野兽是要吃人的，在它没有被打死以前，即使已被团团围住，甚至受了伤，但总要有一番垂死挣扎，一有可能，还要抓人、咬人、吃人。那么，在困兽面前的人，该怎样办呢？没别的，不让困兽有丝毫喘息机会，同它斗争到底，直到把它打死。
    我们把帝国主义和一切反动派比做野兽，那是因为它们所代表的，是现代社会最野蛮的、最反动的、吃人的垄断资本的利益。这就决定了它的兽性，决定了它的活动规律，决定了它的一套野兽哲学。“伊索寓言”有一段妙喻：公鸡碰上恶猫，有理讲不清。任你公鸡有这样那样的理由来卫护自己，而恶猫还是可以根据歪理一条把公鸡吃掉。恶猫有恶猫的哲学：“我总不能老是没有吃食。”帝国主义者和一切反动派，事实上也沿用了这个逻辑。帝国主义不侵略、不剥削、不压迫别人，石油大王、军火大王岂不要喝西北风？如果艾森豪威尔政府不能为美国大老板赚大钱，谋暴利，老板又要他干啥！当然，帝国主义分子远不及“伊索寓言”那只猫天真，他不会说出事物的真相，而是美其名曰“维护自由世界的安全”。实质都是一样。在所谓“安全”的幌子下，横行霸道，明抢暗偷，搞破坏，搞颠复，无恶不作。对这种种强盗行径，艾森豪威尔在这次苏联打下美国间谍飞机以后，曾有一个招供，说这是美国的“国策”！这就不须多加解释了。一句话，彻底暴露出美帝国主义侵略成性的本质。
    当然，美帝国主义今天的处境，并不像那只神气活现的恶猫，而是一只困兽。经过全世界和平力量七斗八斗，左揪右打，越来越孤立，越来越狼狈，这就迫使它为了掩盖扩军备战的真正目的，不得不耍些拙劣的花招，空谈什么“和平”、“谈判”等等甜言蜜语，在乌鸦身上插上几根孔雀毛。看来，艾森豪威尔这几年对他自己那套令人作呕的演技，颇为自鸣得意的。独唱，自然也很无聊，伴奏是不可少的。南斯拉夫现代修正主义者就担任了这个可耻的角色。为了替它的“恩人”摆脱窘境，它忠心耿耿地为美帝国主义搽胭抹粉，说什么帝国主义的本性已经起了变化，仿佛美帝国主义已经放下屠刀，立地成佛。然而，这骗得过人么？
    “我们说‘帝国主义是很凶恶的’，就是说它的本性是不能改变的，帝国主义分子决不肯放下屠刀，他们也决不能成佛，直至他们的灭亡。”（“评白皮书”）即使失败了，并不变其本性。毛泽东同志把帝国主义和一切反动派的逻辑，概括为这样：捣乱、失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡。这才是反映客观规律的真理。帝国主义不捣乱，就不成其为帝国主义。当然，捣乱方式很多，有真刀真枪，也有“武戏文唱”；有时它会老羞成怒显出凶恶的本相，而有时又会把本相掩蔽起来，扮笑脸，甚至会假装一副可怜相。但万变不离其宗，目的一个，为了制造国际紧张局势，便于大老板发横财。其所以要在失败后装死，扮笑脸，无非为了赢得喘息机会，养好创伤，然后在一个早上猛扑过来，把革命扼死。中国人民最熟悉美帝国主义这一套。上海郊区一位女社员说得好：“美帝国主义好话说尽，坏事做绝，嘴里讲出糖来，腰里抽出刀来。”这位劳动者几句生动的语言，道出了美帝国主义最本质的东西。
    那么，怎么办？对垂死挣扎中的困兽，只能以斗还斗，加倍地斗。它们有各式各样的捣乱，我们有各式各样的斗争。它们捣乱到底，我们斗争到底。但须说明一点，我们同帝国主义坚决斗争，并不幻想它能通过斗争，自行放下屠刀。这不切实际。谁指望野兽能经过七斗八斗变成小白兔么？那是有害的天真！外国有句俗话，“兔子挨了几次打，学会擦火柴。”而野兽，一辈子也变不了兔子。困兽要惩戒，装死的野兽更要提防。原来怕的，不怕了；原来有幻想的，警惕了，人人看清帝国主义的活动规律，大家起来同它斗争，使野兽再无可欺之鸡，更无可偷之食。野兽的寿命，也就不会很长了。
