Guangdong Promotes Phonetic Literacy Method Based on Dialect Area Characteristics
Striving to Eradicate Illiteracy Early and Learn Putonghua Well
    (Our Dispatch) Guangdong Province is actively learning and promoting the phonetic literacy experience of Wanrong County, Shanxi Province, striving to eradicate illiteracy early and learn Putonghua well. Currently, relevant departments in Guangdong Province, based on the characteristics of the province's dialect areas, have decided to use Putonghua phonetic alphabet to assist literacy in general urban industrial and mining areas, and to use dialect phonetic alphabets to assist literacy in rural areas. The "draft" phonetic schemes for four dialects—Cantonese, Hakka, Chaozhou, and Hainanese—have been drafted and announced throughout the province in order to experiment and widely solicit opinions for final revision and implementation. At the same time, a phonetic literacy pilot working group has been formed to carry out pilot work in Zhongshan County.

    Guangdong Province has complex dialects, with several dialects in one area. According to this characteristic, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has instructed that Putonghua phonetic literacy teaching should be directly used in towns and cities above the county level and in factories and enterprises; in rural areas and small towns, dialect phonetic literacy should be used first, and Putonghua should be learned after becoming literate. The four dialect phonetic schemes (draft) were formulated under the leadership of the Cultural and Educational Department of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, by the Provincial Department of Education, which invited experts, professors, and responsible cadres from relevant units to jointly formulate them. In the process of formulating the schemes, opinions from all parties were widely solicited, and multiple discussions, studies, and repeated revisions were conducted to make the drafted schemes (draft) as adaptable as possible to the requirements of phonetic literacy and the characteristics of each dialect. At the same time, in order to make it easier for students in dialect areas to learn the Putonghua phonetic alphabet after relying on dialect alphabets for phonetic literacy, the above-mentioned phonetic alphabets for the four dialects now being drafted all adopt the letters of the Putonghua phonetic scheme as much as possible, and unify the dialect phonetics that can be unified with Putonghua as much as possible. At the same time, the Guangdong Province Phonetic Literacy Pilot Working Group has also selected Zhongshan County as a pilot area, and in the Guangzhou dialect area and the Hakka dialect area, two Putonghua phonetic literacy learning classes and one Guangzhou dialect and one Hakka dialect phonetic literacy learning class have been held respectively to conduct phonetic literacy teaching experiments. The pilot working group is led by the Cultural and Educational Department of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and is composed of more than 100 cadres and teachers drawn from the Provincial Department of Education, the Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Provincial Women's Federation, the Chinese Department of Zhongshan University, the Foshan Prefectural Commissioner's Office of Culture and Education Bureau, and the Zhongshan County Bureau of Culture and Education. The actual time for the pilot working group to conduct phonetic literacy teaching is expected to be 150 to 180 hours, and students are required to be able to recognize 1,500 common characters, smoothly read phonetic popular reading materials, and write application documents of about 300 characters after this period of study. Now, Guangzhou, Shantou, Hainan and other regions are training key personnel and conducting pilot work at the same time. Some enterprises and streets in Guangzhou are also actively organizing the study of Putonghua phonetic literacy.

    广东根据方言地区特点推广注音识字法
    力争提前扫除文盲学好普通话
    本报讯　广东省正在积极地学习和推广山西万荣县注音识字经验，争取提前扫除文盲，学好普通话。目前，广东省有关部门根据本省方言地区的特点，决定在一般城市工矿区用普通话注音字母帮助扫盲，在农村用方言注音字母帮助扫盲。广州话、客家话、潮州话、海南话四种方言的注音方案“草案”已经拟订，并向全省公布，以便一边试验，一边广泛征求意见，最后修正定稿，全面推行。同时，已组成注音识字试点工作组，到中山县开展试点工作。
    广东省方言复杂，一个地区有几种方言。根据这种特点，中共广东省委已指示在县城以上的城镇和工厂、企业中直接用普通话注音识字法教学；在农村和小城镇则先用方言注音识字，脱盲后再学习普通话。拟出的四种方言注音方案（草案），是在中共广东省委文教部领导下，由省教育厅邀集有关单位的专家、教授和负责干部共同拟订的。在拟订方案的过程中，曾广泛征集各方面的意见，进行了多次的讨论研究和反复修改，使拟订的方案（草案）尽可能地适应注音识字的要求和各方言的特点。同时，为了使方言地区的学员依靠方言字母注音识字以后，容易学会普通话注音字母起见，现在拟订的上述四种方言的注音字母，都尽量采用了普通话注音方案的字母，而且把能够统一的方言语音尽可能和普通话统一起来。与此同时，广东省注音识字试点工作组又选择中山县为试点，在广州方言地区和客家方言地区，分别举办两个普通话注音识字学习班和广州话、客家话各一个注音识字学习班，进行注音识字教学的试验。试点工作组由中共广东省委文教部领导，从省教育厅、省团委、省妇联、中山大学中文系、佛山专署文教局和中山县文教局等单位抽调干部和教师一百多人组成。试点工作组实际进行注音识字教学的时间预计为一百五十至一百八十个小时，要求学员经过这段时间的学习，能够认识一千五百个常用字，顺利地阅读注音的通俗读物，写出三百字左右的应用文。现在，广州、汕头和海南等地区都在一边训练骨干，一边进行试点工作。广州市的部分企业和街道，也积极地组织了普通话注音识字的学习。
