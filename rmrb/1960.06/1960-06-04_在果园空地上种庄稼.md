Suggestion

    Planting Crops in the Vacant Land of Orchards
    Newly built orchards in various places have a lot of vacant land. Planting crops on these vacant lands can result in a double harvest of fruit and grain.
    Many places have the habit of agroforestry intercropping. According to the experience of fruit farmers, if bean crops or other short crops are planted around the fruit tree pits (water basins) within three years of planting, the following benefits can be obtained: it can conserve water and soil; it can provide shade and reduce weeds; and bean stubble can be used as fertilizer (the root nodule bacteria of leguminous crops can absorb nitrogen from the air, which is beneficial to the growth of fruit trees). Therefore, using vacant land in orchards to plant crops is a win-win situation.

### 在果园空地上种庄稼

    在果园空地上种庄稼
    各地新建的果园都有不少空地，把这些空地种上庄稼，就可以获得果、粮双丰收。
    不少地方有农林间作的习惯。据果农的经验，凡是定植三年以内的果树穴（水盘）周围，如果种上豆类作物或其他矮棵作物，可以收到以下好处：可以保持水土；可以披荫减少杂草；豆茬可当作肥料（豆类作物的根瘤菌可从空气中吸收氮，有益于果树生长）。所以，利用果园空地种植作物是一举两得的事。
