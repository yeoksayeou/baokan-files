Residents of Yongam-myeon, Seongju-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do, drove out a lackey of the Syngman Rhee group, a puppet district chief (i.e., district chief) who had always oppressed the people, on June 3. According to the Hapdong News Agency, on this day, local residents sat in front of the puppet township office and held a two-hour demonstration, shouting slogans such as "All township chiefs and staff appointed by the Liberal Party get out of here." The puppet district chief and five staff members, fearing the power of the people, were forced to agree to step down on the 6th.

When the demonstrators arrived at the Gwangju "Tax Bureau," they called out the puppet "Director" and asked him to answer the demands of the masses. In the face of the angry masses, the trembling puppet "Director" had to accept some of the demands made by the masses.

Employees working in the puppet government agencies also launched a struggle under the influence of the rising fighting spirit of the broad masses of the people.
