    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 7th -- The "Soviet Air Force Newspaper" published an article on the 7th entitled "Vigilance, More Vigilance," exposing the U.S. imperialists' use of various shameless means to carry out espionage activities against socialist countries in every possible way, and demanding that people maintain a high degree of vigilance against these activities of the United States.
    The article said that U.S. spy agencies not only conduct espionage activities from the sky, but also spend hundreds of millions of dollars every year to organize and expand its spy network, publish espionage books, collect all kinds of intelligence materials, and use every possible means to send spies to the Soviet Union and other countries in the socialist camp.
    The article said that American spies often operate under the guise of "diplomatic representatives." For example, the U.S. military attache in the Soviet Union, Langiel, who was expelled from the Soviet Union at the end of last year, was caught red-handed by the Soviet authorities for engaging in espionage activities in the Soviet Union and meeting with his accomplices. Imperialist "diplomats" run around in various parts of the Soviet Union, trying to go deep into areas where important military and industrial targets, airports and armed forces are located to collect intelligence. They also try to contact travelers along the way in order to inquire about the materials they need from the conversations. The article cited an example that in May of last year, personnel from the military attache's office of a certain capitalist country's embassy in the Soviet Union took pictures near a military target in Moscow and were exposed.
    The article said that in recent years, imperialist spies have also come to the Soviet Union as "travelers" to collect intelligence. Imperialist spies have also stepped up their provocative activities against Soviet citizens abroad in recent years, trying every possible means to obtain confidential intelligence from them and attempting to force them not to return to their motherland.
    The article said that it is becoming increasingly difficult for American spies to work in the Soviet Union. Therefore, they often use technical tools to collect intelligence. For example, U.S. spy agencies have established radar stations in the Turkish region near the Soviet Union to detect the Soviet Union's test rocket weapons. They also use the latest electronic instruments and means such as studying various Soviet newspapers and scientific journals to obtain various intelligence.
    The article said that all these facts require the Soviet people, especially the military personnel, to constantly improve their political vigilance, strictly keep state military secrets, and resolutely thwart all attempts by hostile elements that are harmful to the security of the Soviet Union.

    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th -- The "Soviet Naval Newspaper" revealed in an article today that the U.S. Navy intelligence agencies are engaged in dirty espionage activities.
    The article said that according to materials published in the United States, the U.S. Navy intelligence agencies occupy a prominent position in the Navy. A reconnaissance officer of this agency, Yanger Lunson, said in his book on the U.S. spy system that the U.S. Navy leaders attach great importance to "well-organized and well-trained intelligence agencies." The Navy's spy agencies have a wide network of branches. "In the Navy, senior officers on warships or stationed at bases, as well as commanders of various units, fleets, and special formations, have staff reconnaissance departments..." The Naval Intelligence Agency is not only responsible for collecting intelligence on navies around the world, but also for collecting intelligence on coastal areas and ports around the world. It is now continuing a work that began during World War II -- compiling detailed plans for possible landing operations on a global scale.
    The newspaper pointed out that the U.S. President's statement that the U.S. naval forces do not even know what espionage activities are is an extremely clumsy disguise.

    苏联报纸发表文章指出
    必须警惕美国间谍活动
    美国千方百计派间谍钻进社会主义国家
    美国海军搜集编制登陆作战计划的情报
    据新华社莫斯科电 “苏联空军报”7日发表题为“警惕，再警惕”的文章，揭露美帝国主义用各种无耻手段千方百计地对社会主义国家进行间谍活动，并要求人们对美国的这种活动保持高度的警惕性。
    文章说，美国间谍机关不仅从天空进行间谍活动，他们每年还花成亿美元来组织和扩充它的间谍网，出版间谍书籍，收买各种情报材料，利用一切可能把间谍派遣到苏联和社会主义阵营其他国家。
    文章说，美国间谍经常在“外交代表”的面具下进行活动。例如，去年年底被苏联驱逐出境的美国驻苏联大使馆武官兰吉耳，就是因为他在苏联进行间谍活动并且在同其爪牙会面时被苏联有关机关当场捕获的。帝国主义的“外交家”们在苏联各地跑，企图深入到设有重要军事目标和工业目标、机场和武装部队所在地等地区收集情报，他们还在沿途设法同旅客接触，以便从闲谈中打听他们所需要的材料。文章举例说，去年5月，某个资本主义国家驻苏联使馆武官处的人员就曾经在莫斯科一军事目标附近摄取图片并被揭露。
    文章说，近年来，帝国主义间谍还以“旅行家”身份到苏联收集情报。帝国主义间谍近年来还加紧对在国外的苏联公民进行挑衅活动，千方百计地企图从他们那里获得机密情报，并企图强迫他们不返回祖国。
    文章说，美国间谍在苏联进行工作越来越困难了。因此，他们就经常利用技术工具来收集情报。例如，美国间谍机关在靠近苏联的土耳其地区建立雷达站，侦察苏联试验火箭武器的情况。他们还利用最新式的电子仪器以及用研究苏联各种报刊、科学杂志等手段来获得各种情报。
    文章说，这一切事实要求苏联人民，首先是军人经常要提高政治警惕性，严格保守国家军事机密，坚决挫败敌对分子有害苏联安全的一切企图。
    新华社莫斯科8日电  “苏联海军报”今天在一篇文章中揭露美国海军情报机关进行肮脏的间谍活动。
    文章说，根据美国发表的材料，美国的海军情报机关在海军中占有显要的地位。这个机关的一个侦察人扬格·伦森在他的关于美国间谍系统的一书中说，美国海军的领导人十分重视“编制完善、训练有素的情报机关”。海军的间谍机关有着广泛的分支机构网。“在海军中，军舰上的或驻在基地的高级军官，以及各部队、舰队和特种编队的指挥官都有参谋侦察部……”。海军情报机关不仅负责收集有关全世界海军的情报，而且还担负收集有关世界沿海地带和港口情报的责任，它现在正在继续进行尚在第二次世界大战时便开始的一项工作——编制在全世界范围可能进行的登陆作战的详细计划。
    报纸指出，美国总统关于美国海军部队甚至不了解什么是间谍活动的说法，是极其拙劣的伪装。
