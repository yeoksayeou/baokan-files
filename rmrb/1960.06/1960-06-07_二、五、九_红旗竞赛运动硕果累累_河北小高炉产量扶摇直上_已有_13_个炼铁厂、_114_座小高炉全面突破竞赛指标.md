Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, June 5th. The vast workforce on the "Small Foreign Groups" iron smelting front in Hebei Province launched the "Two, Five, Nine" Red Flag Competition aimed at comprehensively improving the production level of small blast furnaces, striving to tap production potential in every possible way and promoting rapid production progress. From March to the present year, thirteen iron smelting plants and one hundred and fourteen small blast furnaces across the province have successively and comprehensively exceeded the "Two, Five, Nine" competition targets. The monthly average utilization coefficient of the blast furnaces has reached above two, the monthly labor efficiency per worker has reached five tons, the qualified rate of pig iron has exceeded 90%, and the coke-to-iron ratio has been reduced to 0.9 tons. In particular, since entering the Red May, production has soared. The pig iron output of many regions and enterprises has increased not by a few percentage points, but by tens of percentage points or even doubled. The average daily output of the province in mid-May increased by 15% compared with the first ten days of the month, and the average daily output in the last ten days of the month increased by 7.1% compared with mid-May.

The "Two, Five, Nine" movement was launched under the direct leadership of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. In order to realize the urgent need for a large industrial overproduction and accelerate the technological transformation of agriculture, the Provincial Party Committee studied the advanced deeds of small blast furnace production in some iron smelting plants reaching and approaching the level of large blast furnaces, and decided to launch a "Two, Five, Nine" Red Flag Competition throughout the province to comprehensively improve the production level of small blast furnaces. After this call was made, it was immediately warmly responded to by the iron smelting workers of the province, and a large-scale high-yield competition was rapidly launched between regions, factories, furnaces, and shifts. Encouraged by the slogan "Seizing Every Second, Not Letting Go of Every Ounce," the workers of the iron smelting plants in the Baoding area were all high in spirit, and adopted the method of finding key points for each furnace and making innovations in each link, which prompted the rapid increase of the average daily output of pig iron in the whole area by more than one time.

In this new high tide of production competition, various localities, with the spirit of continuous revolution, concentrated their efforts to carry out large-scale and thorough technical transformation of small blast furnaces as an important measure to achieve the "Two, Five, Nine" competition targets. From the province to the city, county, and iron smelting plant, around the key to comprehensively promoting the high smelting intensity iron smelting technology of "taking large air volume and high temperature as the key, and raw materials as the basis," furnace transformation plans were formulated at each level, and the method of organizing battles and breakthroughs was adopted to complete them within a time limit. By the end of May, in just over a month, the furnace body systems of one hundred and twenty small blast furnaces in the province had completed technical transformation, and more than three hundred and thirty hot blast stoves had implemented the advanced experience created in Ningxiang, Hunan. At the same time, more than 10,000 meters of light rail for in-plant transportation were newly laid, and most iron smelting plants realized the track and vehicle transportation.

Mining, coking, transportation and other industries worked together with one heart and one mind, closely cooperated, and fully guaranteed iron production, which is also a prominent feature of the "Two, Five, Nine" Red Flag Competition. Party committee secretaries at all levels took the lead and established command posts and offices to strengthen the unified leadership of the production, distribution and transportation of iron smelting materials. Under the slogan of ensuring that the blast furnaces "eat enough and eat well," the workers of the province's mining, coal mining, and coking industries launched a vigorous assault battle to seize coal, seize ore, and seize coke, thereby promoting the continuous improvement of production levels and adapting to the needs of the rapidly improving iron smelting capacity. The vast number of workers in the transportation sector launched a "transport more to ensure high yield" competition. From land to water, from railways to highways, vehicles and ships loaded with smelting materials such as ore and coal flowed day and night. At present, the raw material reserves such as ore in various iron smelting plants throughout the province are sufficient for more than twenty days of production needs.

The leading cadres of various regions and enterprises carried forward the fighting style of the Great Leap Forward of Steel in 1958, and went deep into the furnace front to guard the furnace and sleep beside the furnace with the workers, participating in production while inspecting production, and directing production, so that problems in production could be discovered quickly and solved well. In many iron smelting enterprises, 60% to 70% of the cadres went to the furnace front, participating in labor while directing production. At the same time, many regional party committee secretaries, metallurgical bureau directors, factory directors and other leading cadres, grasped the key to production, adopted the method of breaking through one point to drive the whole situation, and widely cultivated "experimental fields," which also effectively promoted the continued leap forward in production.

    “二、五、九”红旗竞赛运动硕果累累
    河北小高炉产量扶摇直上
    已有13个炼铁厂、114座小高炉全面突破竞赛指标
    新华社天津5日电　河北省“小洋群”炼铁战线上的广大职工开展以全面提高小高炉生产水平为目的的“二、五、九”红旗竞赛运动，千方百计发掘生产潜力，促进生产日新月异。从今年3月到现在，全省已有十三个炼铁厂、一百一十四座小高炉，先后全面突破了“二、五、九”竞赛指标，高炉月平均利用系数达到了二以上，全员月劳动效率达到了五吨，生铁合格率突破90％以上，焦铁比降低到零点九吨。特别是进入红五月以来，生产更是扶摇直上。许多地区和企业的生铁产量增长不是百分之几，而是百分之几十甚至成倍地上升。全省5月中旬平均日产量比上旬增长15％，下旬平均日产量又比中旬提高7．1％。
    “二、五、九”运动，是在中共河北省委的直接领导之下开展起来的。省委为了实现工业大超产和加速农业技术改造的迫切需要，研究了一些炼铁厂的小高炉生产达到和接近大高炉水平的先进事迹以后，决定在全省范围内掀起一个以全面提高小高炉生产水平的“二、五、九”红旗竞赛运动。这个号召提出以后，立即得到全省炼铁职工热烈响应，迅速掀起了地区与地区、厂与厂、炉与炉、班与班之间的大面积高产竞赛。保定地区各炼铁厂职工在“分秒必争，斤两不让”的口号鼓舞下，个个斗志昂扬，采取炉炉找关键、环环闹革新的办法，促使全区生铁平均日产量迅速提高一倍以上。
    在这个新的生产竞赛高潮中，各地以不断革命的精神，集中力量大规模地对小高炉进行全面彻底的技术改造，作为实现“二、五、九”竞赛指标的重要措施。从省到市、县和炼铁厂，围绕全面推行“以大风高温为纲，以原料为基础”的高冶炼强度炼铁技术的关键，层层制定高炉改造规划，并且采取组织战役突击的办法，限期完成。到5月底的短短一个多月，全省已有一百二十座小高炉的炉体系统完成了技术改造，有三百三十多座热风炉推行了湖南宁乡创造的先进经验。同时，还新铺设了一万多米的厂内运输轻便轨道，大部分炼铁厂实现了运输轨道化和车子化。
    矿山、炼焦、运输等行业同心协力，紧密配合，全力保铁，也是“二、五、九”红旗竞赛运动中的一个突出的特点。各级党委书记挂帅，并成立了指挥部、办公室，统一加强了炼铁材料的生产、分配和运输工作的领导。全省采矿、挖煤、炼焦的职工，在保证高炉“吃饱、吃好”的口号下，如火如荼地开展夺煤、夺矿石、夺焦的突击战，从而促进生产水平不断提高，及时地适应了炼铁能力迅速提高的需要。运输部门的广大职工开展了“多运保高产”的竞赛。从旱路到水路，从铁路到公路，满载矿石、煤炭等冶炼物资的车辆、船只，昼夜川流不息。目前，全省各炼铁厂储备的矿石等原料，足够二十多天的生产需要。
    各地区和企业的领导干部发扬了1958年大炼钢铁时的那种战斗作风，纷纷深入到炉前同工人一道守炉餐、伴炉眠，边参加生产边检查生产、边指挥生产，使生产中的问题发现得快、解决得好。许多炼铁企业有60％到70％的干部到炉前，一边参加劳动一边指挥生产。同时，许多地区党委书记、冶金局长、厂长等领导干部，抓住生产关键，采取突破一点带动全盘的方法，广种“试验田”，也有效地促进了生产的持续跃进。
