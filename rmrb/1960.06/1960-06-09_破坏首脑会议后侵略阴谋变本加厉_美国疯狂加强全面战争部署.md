Xinhua News Agency, 8th June, Washington dispatch: After sabotaging the Four Power Summit, the United States government is strengthening its war deployment worldwide.

	Intensifying Aggressive Activities in the Far East
	The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) Council meeting, which just concluded in Washington, planned steps to intensify the arms race in the Far East and interfere in the national democratic movements of the people in the region.

	Eisenhower's upcoming visit to the Far East is described by the "Washington Daily News" and the New York "World-Telegram and Sun" as an "appropriate action" following the SEATO meeting. Some columnists in Washington are touting Eisenhower's visit to the Far East as having a "specific purpose." They are promoting that a "real outbreak could occur" in the Taiwan Strait or Indochina.

	According to reports, in the Taiwan Strait area, the United States has taken a series of aggressive military measures directly aimed at China. Associated Press reporter Musa reported on the 6th that "American air and sea power in this part of the world has made a deep impression, but has not fully revealed its deployment," and that "American aircraft began arriving on Monday at the huge Kungkuan Air Base in central Formosa (referring to Taiwan), as part of a deployment of approximately one hundred and twenty aircraft in the Far East, called a training exercise." According to a recent announcement by the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. government has recently delivered a batch of F-104 jet fighters to the Chiang Kai-shek Group and has sent additional troops to Okinawa.

	An American Air Force spokesman in Manila announced on the 6th that the U.S. Tactical Air Command's "composite strike force" is currently deployed at "strategic strongholds" in Southeast Asia, preparing to conduct large-scale exercises in Taiwan, Thailand, and the Philippines in the coming days (such exercises are already underway in Thailand).

	The spokesman made a blatant war threat, saying that the purpose of the exercise was to "test how quickly the U.S. Tactical Air Command can strike areas where trouble arises."

	Vigorously Arming the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
	The United States is also vigorously working to arm the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. U.S. Secretary of Defense Gates and British Minister of Defense Watkinson recently held talks on plans for further arms expansion by the two countries and issued a joint statement on the 6th stating that the two countries had decided to jointly "test-produce" the U.S. "Skybolt" medium-range missile, which would be used to equip the two countries' bombers. Gates and Watkinson also discussed the issue of equipping NATO forces with "Polaris" missiles. West German Defense Minister Strauss also arrived in Washington on the 7th to discuss ways to accelerate West German rearmament with Gates.

	Increasing Military Spending to Expand New Weapons
	Arms expansion activities are also vigorously underway in the United States itself. The Senate Appropriations Subcommittee approved an additional $600 million in military appropriations on the 7th to expand new weapons, especially recommending "super" aircraft carriers. According to the "Wall Street Journal," the Senate is also preparing to add new funding for launching "Polaris" missile submarines, air defense preparedness, reconnaissance satellites, army modernization, military transport aircraft, "Atlas" long-range missiles, and more long-range bombers.

	Developing Missile Weapons and Nuclear Weapons
	The work of developing missile weapons and nuclear weapons is also being stepped up. It has been revealed that the U.S. Congress will decide to add two "Atlas" intercontinental missile squadrons. The development of the "Nike-Zeus" anti-missile missile, which had been halted for a time due to internal disagreements, has now resumed. Various missile tests are constantly being conducted in the United States. On June 3 alone, the United States launched two "Bomarc" missiles, one "Mace" missile, and one "Redstone" missile.

### 破坏首脑会议后侵略阴谋变本加厉  美国疯狂加强全面战争部署

    美帝国主义不肯裁军加紧备战
    破坏首脑会议后侵略阴谋变本加厉
    美国疯狂加强全面战争部署
    据新华社8日讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府在破坏了四国政府首脑会议之后，正在世界范围内加强战争部署。
  加紧在远东的侵略活动
    刚刚在华盛顿结束的东南亚集团理事会会议策划了加紧在远东地区进行扩军备战和干涉这个地区人民的民族民主运动的步骤。
    艾森豪威尔即将对远东地区进行的访问被“华盛顿每日新闻”和纽约“世界电讯与太阳报”称作是继东南亚集团会议之后的一项“适当的行动”。华盛顿某些专栏作家宣传艾森豪威尔到远东的访问具有“特定的目的”。他们宣传在台湾海峡或印度支那“可能发生真正的爆发”。
    据报道，在台湾海峡地区，美国已经采取一连串矛头直接指向中国的侵略性军事措施。美联社记者穆萨6日报道说，“世界这个地区的美国空海力量已经做了给人很深印象的但是没有充分透露的部署”，“美国飞机星期一开始到达福摩萨（指台湾）中部巨大的公馆空军基地，这是称之为训练演习的在远东部署大约一百二十架飞机的一部分”。据美国国防部不久前宣布，美国政府最近已经把一批F—104喷气式战斗机交给了蒋介石集团，并且增派了军队到冲绳。
    马尼拉的美国空军发言人6日宣布，美国战术空军司令部的“混合突击机队”目前已部署在东南亚的“战略据点”上，准备在今后几天内在台湾、泰国和菲律宾举行大规模的演习（在泰国已进行这种演习）。
    发言人进行露骨的战争恫吓说，这个演习的目的是要“考验美国战术空军司令部究竟能够如何迅速地击中一旦发生麻烦的地区”。
    大力武装北大西洋集团
    美国也在大力进行武装北大西洋公约组织国家的工作。美国国防部长盖茨和英国国防大臣沃金森最近就两国进一步扩军的计划举行了会谈，并在6日发表联合声明说，两国已决定联合“试制”美国的“闪电”式中程导弹，这种导弹将用来装备两国的轰炸机。盖茨和沃金森还讨论了用“北极星”式导弹装备北大西洋公约组织部队的问题。西德国防部长施特劳斯7日也到达华盛顿，同盖茨讨论加快西德重新武装的办法。
    增加军费扩充新武器
    美国国内的扩军活动也在大力进行。参议院拨款小组委员会7日批准增加六亿美元的军事拨款来扩充新武器，特别是建议“超级”航空母舰。据“华尔街日报”报道，参议院还准备增加关于发射“北极星”的导弹潜水艇、空中戒备的准备工作、侦察卫星、陆军现代化，军事运输飞机，“阿特拉斯”远程导弹和更多远程轰炸机的新经费。
    发展导弹武器和核武器
    发展导弹武器和核武器的工作也在加紧进行着。据透露，美国国会将决定增加两个“阿特拉斯”式洲际导弹中队。曾经一度由于内部意见不一而停止发展的“奈克—宙斯”反导弹导弹，现在也恢复发展。各式各样的导弹试验不断在美国进行。仅6月3日一天美国就发射了两枚“鲍马克”、一枚“马斯”和一枚“红石”导弹。
