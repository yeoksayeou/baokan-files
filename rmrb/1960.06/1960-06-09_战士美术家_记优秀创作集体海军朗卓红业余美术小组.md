Soldier Artists
    ——Remembering the Outstanding Creative Collective, the Navy Lang Zhuohong Amateur Art Group
    By our reporter Li Jianyu
    Opening the latest issue of “Chinese Painting,” a miniature version of the long scroll Chinese painting “Spring in a Fishing Village” immediately captivates the heart. In front of the scene, several amiable sailors are helping fishermen repair their boats on the beach; in the distance, verdant mountains loom, white clouds surround the fishing village, and along a secluded path lined with peach blossoms, a group of fishing village children walk, carrying pots and pitchers to deliver tea to the naval warriors. The entire scene is not only rich with the unique atmosphere of spring in a fishing village but also displays a moving picture of the close relationship between the military and the people, like fish and water. The people who created this painting are the Lang Zhuohong we are about to talk about.
    In the two years of the Great Leap Forward, Lang Zhuohong published more than twenty oil paintings, Chinese paintings, woodcuts, paper-cuts, and propaganda posters reflecting naval life in publications such as "Fine Arts," "East Wind," "Chinese Painting," and "PLA Pictorial." These artistic works, which are ideologically clear, combative, and full of the flavor of life, won praise from many viewers at the "Naval Art Exhibition" jointly organized by the Political Department of the Navy and the Chinese Artists Association, as well as at the "Second PLA Art Exhibition." It turns out that Lang Zhuohong is not a professional art worker, but an amateur art creation group composed of three young naval soldiers—staff member Ran Maokui, draftsman Zhao Yuxian, and accountant Zhou Yongjia. Lang Zhuohong is the name of this collective.
    Ran Maokui, Zhao Yuxian, and Zhou Yongjia are all elementary and junior high school students who joined the army around 1956. Before joining the army, when they were in school, they only liked to look at paintings, and sometimes they would "copy cats and draw tigers" on paper. None of them thought that they would have any development in art creation in the future. When they came to the revolutionary big family of the army as people's soldiers, they were immediately attracted by the rich and colorful naval life of unity, tension, seriousness, and liveliness: the majestic ships breaking through the vast blue sea are so magnificent! The young sailors who vigilantly patrol the motherland's oceans day and night are so brave and heroic! And the close unity between officers and soldiers, between comrades, like brothers, is so inspiring! They saw these things one by one, kept them in their hearts, and the moving things in their hearts became more and more, and a hand that liked to draw unconsciously began to draw. Not long after they joined the army, they became active participants in grassroots club art activities. On the blackboard, in the bulletin board, and on the walls of the club, people could often see the traces of their paintings reflecting naval life in many ways. These works, if viewed purely from a technical point of view, are indeed somewhat simple and rough, but they are permeated with love for a sailor's naval life, and at the same time, they vividly and timely cooperated with the central tasks of the troops, so they were welcomed by the majority of sailors and valued by the leaders of the troops. The encouragement of the sailors, the support of the leaders, coupled with their own strong desire to express naval life and their creative interests, became stronger and stronger, and their enthusiasm became greater and greater. By 1957, a certain unit of the Navy held an exhibition of soldiers' art works, and they exhibited their own works separately. It was at this exhibition that Ran Maokui, Zhao Yuxian, and Zhou Yongjia met each other. As soon as they met, the topic naturally turned to how to profoundly express the rich and colorful combat life of their troops. In the conversation, everyone felt that they were weak and that it would be good to have a few comrades together to study and study. In this way, the three formed an amateur art creation group to improve their painting skills together. At this time, they felt that simply drawing some simple propaganda posters was obviously no longer able to adapt to the broad, profound, and colorful reality of the Great Leap Forward era. With the support of the Party, they decided to use their wisdom and sweat to break through various advanced creative forms such as Chinese painting, oil painting, and woodcut. But how to paint oil paintings and how to master the art of woodcut? When they made their first oil painting, they didn't even know the common sense of using oil to mix colors. When they mixed with water, water droplets rolled everywhere on the drawing board. The first time they made a multi-color woodcut, they painted all the colors on a carved woodblock and printed a "big colorful face." Difficulties were placed in front of them one after another, but they were soldiers of the Mao Zedong era. They broke the mystery of art, they had the determination and perseverance to overcome all difficulties, and besides, real life was so fascinating and had to be painted!
    Speaking of creative themes, it is really extremely rich, and the difficulty lies in creative thinking and creative skills. Once, they were lying in bed listening to the roaring of the coastal artillery during the exercise, and they couldn't sleep well. They felt that the coastal artillery soldiers were carrying out intense combat training day and night, guarding the motherland's coastal defense, and it was really worth painting well. They put on their clothes and got up and ran to the seaside to see, and immediately studied the composition after returning. They spent a lot of effort to compose several sketches, all of which showed the scene of the coastal artillery soldiers operating in the artillery positions. When they showed it to the chief, the chief said: "The people are painted too small. Didn't Chairman Mao tell us long ago that the decisive factor in war is people, not things! Even if you paint the artillery in detail and realistically, it's just artillery." They felt that the chief was right and immediately began to revise it, but it was really difficult to paint people. When they were creating this Chinese painting "Combat Alert," many of the scenes of the soldiers running did not look like it. In their own words: "You want him to run, but he just can't run on paper." What to do? They thought of a "trick." After dinner, the three of them went to the hillside together. One person made a running posture, and two people observed and drew on the side. They worked for two nights in a row and finally composed the composition of this painting. Before creating the painting "Rescuing Fishermen," they had been out to sea with the ship six times to carefully observe naval life, depict the brave image of each sailor on the ship, and pay attention to the changes in the vast sea in the wind and waves at every moment. Through the tempering of real life, they not only expanded their horizons but also fell in love with the naval troops they served even more, and fell in love with the sea and the sailors.
    These three soldiers, who have painted more than sixty paintings in the past two years and have made gratifying achievements in art, have carried out almost all their creative activities in their spare time. They are very clear that they are first and foremost naval soldiers. They not only settle down in their jobs but also strive to be the first in work, study, and labor. Ran Maokui has been rated as an advanced worker in his unit twice, Zhou Yongjia is often praised by the leaders, and Zhao Yuxian's drawing quality has always been very good. The art works of the Lang Zhuohong team are a natural expression of their love for the troops and their love for work. This time, Ran Maokui represented their collective at the National Conference of Heroes in Culture and Education. They are determined to better use their pens to reflect the glorious struggle life of the People's Army and better serve national defense construction and socialist construction in the future.

    战士美术家
    ——记优秀创作集体海军朗卓红业余美术小组
    本报记者　李健羽
    打开最近一期的“中国画”，一幅缩制的长卷国画“渔家春天”，立刻扣住人的心弦。画面前，几个神色可亲的水兵正在海滩上帮助渔民修理渔船；远处青山如黛，白云缭绕着渔村，一片桃花的幽径中，走来了一群携壶提浆给海军战士送茶的渔家儿女。整个画面既富有渔村春天特有的浓郁气息，又显示了军民情同鱼水般的动人景象。作这幅画的人，就是我们所要说的朗卓红。
    大跃进的两年来，朗卓红曾经在“美术”“东风”“中国画”“解放军画报”等刊物上，发表了二十多幅以反映海军生活为内容的油画、国画、木刻、剪纸和宣传画。这些思想性鲜明、战斗性较强、生活气息十分浓郁的美术作品，在海军政治部和中国美术家协会联合举办的“海军美术作品展览会”以及“人民解放军第二届美术作品展览会”上，博得了不少观众的赞扬。原来朗卓红并不是一个专业的美术工作者，而是三个青年海军战士——工作员冉茂魁、绘图员赵聿贤、会计员周永家组成的业余美术创作小组。朗卓红是这个集体的名字。
    冉茂魁、赵聿贤、周永家都是1956年前后入伍的高小、初中学生。参军以前，在学校读书的时候，他们只是喜欢看画，有时也“照猫画虎”地在纸上画画，谁也没有想到将来在美术创作上会有什么发展。当他们以一个人民战士来到部队这个革命大家庭时，立刻被那团结、紧张、严肃、活泼的丰富多彩的海军生活吸引住了：巍峨的舰艇划破碧波万顷的大海，够多么雄壮！日日夜夜警惕地巡逻在祖国海洋上的青年水兵，够多么勇敢豪迈！而那官兵之间、同志之间有如兄弟般的亲密团结，又是多么激发人的感情呵！这些，他们一件件地看在眼里，记在心上，心里动人的东西越来越多，一只喜欢画画的手就不自觉地画起来了。他们入伍不久就成了基层俱乐部美术活动的积极参加者，在黑板上、在墙报栏里、在俱乐部的墙上，人们时常可以看到他们留下的多方面反映海军生活的画迹。这些作品，如果单纯从技巧上来看，确是有些简单、粗糙，但是那里面却渗透着对一个水兵海军生活的热爱，同时，它也形象地及时配合了部队的中心任务，因此受到了广大水兵的欢迎和部队领导上的重视。水兵们的鼓励，领导上的支持，加上他们自己具有强烈表现海军生活的欲望，创作的兴趣，也就愈来愈浓，干劲越来越大。到1957年，海军某部举办战士美术作品展览会，他们分别展出了自己的作品，也就是在这次展览会上，冉茂魁、赵聿贤、周永家互相认识了。他们一见面，话题自然地转到了如何深刻表现自己部队丰富多采的战斗生活。在交谈中，每个人都觉得自己身单力薄，能经常有几个同志在一起研究研究才好。就这样，三个人便形成了一个业余美术创作小组，共同提高绘画能力。这时候，他们觉得只是画些简单的宣传画，显然已经不能适应大跃进年代里那么宽广、那么深邃、那么绚丽多彩的现实生活。在党的支持下，他们决定用自己的智慧和汗水突破国画、油画、木刻等多种比较高级的创作形式。可是怎样画油画、又怎样掌握木刻这门艺术呢？他们头一次作油画时，连用油调颜色的常识都不懂，用水一调画版上到处滚水珠；头一次搞一幅套色木刻，把所有的颜色都涂在一块刻好的木版上，一印闹了个“大花脸”。困难一个接着一个摆在他们的面前，可是他们是毛泽东时代的战士，他们打破了对艺术的神秘感，他们有克服一切困难的决心和毅力，更何况现实生活又是这样的引人入胜、非画不可！
    说起创作的题材，可真是丰富极了，难就难在创作思想和创作技巧上。有一次，他们躺在床上听着演习的海岸炮隆隆作响，怎么也睡不好觉，感到海岸炮兵日日夜夜进行紧张的战斗训练，守卫着祖国的海防，实在值得好好画一画，他们披衣起身跑到海边去看，回来后马上研究构图，费了很大的劲儿构成几幅草图，都是表现海岸炮兵在炮位上进行操作情景的。拿给首长一看，首长说：“人画的太小了，毛主席不是早就告诉我们，战争的决定因素是人而不是物吗！你们把大炮画得再仔细再逼真，不过就是个大炮而已。”他们觉得首长说得对，立刻着手修改，可是，人可实在难画呀。他们在创作这幅国画“战斗警报”时，画了许多战士奔跑的情景都不像。用他们自己的话说：“你有心让他跑，他在纸上就是跑不起来。”怎办呢？他们想了一个“绝招”，吃过晚饭，三个人一同到山坡上去，一个人做跑的姿势，两个人在旁边一面观察一面画，一连搞了两个晚上，终于把这幅画的构图构成了。在创作“抢救渔民”这幅画以前，他们曾经六次随舰出海，仔细地观察海军生活，描绘舰上每个水兵的勇敢形象，注视辽阔的大海在风浪中每一瞬间的变化。通过实际生活的锻炼，他们不仅扩大了自己的视野，也更加爱上了自己服务的海军部队，爱上了大海和水兵。
    这三个两年来画了六十多幅画，在艺术上有了可喜成就的战士，整个创作活动几乎都是在业余时间进行的。他们十分明确：自己首先是一个海军战士，他们不仅安心本职工作，而且在工作、学习和劳动中处处争先。冉茂魁两次被评为本单位的先进工作者，周永家经常受到领导上的表扬，赵聿贤绘图质量一向很好。朗卓红小组的美术作品，是他们热爱部队、热爱工作的自然流露。这次，冉茂魁代表他们的集体出席了这次全国文教群英会，他们决心今后更好地用笔来反映人民军队光荣的斗争生活，更好地为国防建设和社会主义建设服务。（附图片）
