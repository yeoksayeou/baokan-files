    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 24th. On the eve of the tenth anniversary of the Korean People's Fatherland Liberation War against US imperialist aggression ("June 25th"), 300,000 people in Pyongyang held a rally and demonstration in Kim Il-sung Square this afternoon, demanding that the US aggressor troops immediately get out of South Korea.
    On the same afternoon, similar rallies and demonstrations were also held in Haeju, Chongjin, Sariwon, Kaesong and other major cities in the northern half of Korea.
    The people of Pyongyang, filled with deep hatred for US imperialism, participated in the rally with cartoons satirizing the desperate situation of US imperialism under the blows of the people of various countries in the Far East, and held huge banners with slogans written on them: "The deadly enemy of the Korean people—US imperialism, get out of South Korea!" "Expose and smash the war provocation conspiracy of US imperialism, the vicious enemy of all mankind!" "People of Asia and Africa unite against US imperialism!" "Down with the Huh Jung traitorous clique!" "Representatives of political parties and social groups in North and South Korea should gather together as soon as possible!" The 300,000 people constantly waved their arms and shouted slogans, and the roar of "US troops get out!" shook the earth.
    At 6 p.m., Korean Workers' Party and government leaders Kim Il, Hong Myung-hee, Park Kum-chul, Nam Il, Jung Joon-taek, and heads of various democratic parties and social organizations stepped onto the rostrum.
    Korean Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the Pyongyang People's Committee, Jung Il-ryong, spoke at the meeting. He pointed out that ten years ago, US imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea, creating unprecedented barbaric atrocities in history, and once again exposing the nature of imperialism to the people of the world. He said that the Korean people did not yield. Thanks to the heroic fighting of the Korean People's Army, and with the blood aid of the Chinese People's Volunteers composed of outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people, the US imperialism was finally defeated and forced to sign the armistice agreement, suffering its first disastrous defeat in history. This proves that only when the people unite and wage a tenacious struggle can they defeat the enemy. The Korean people's historic victory has made a great contribution to peace in the Far East and the world.
    Jung Il-ryong said that in the seven years since the armistice, North Korea has completely healed the wounds of war and built an industrial-agricultural country with an independent national economic foundation. The Korean people are continuing to move forward with the spirit of Chollima. He pointed out that the brilliant achievements made by North Korea in socialist construction are a material guarantee for the peaceful reunification of the motherland.
    He said that since the armistice, the Korean and Chinese sides have strictly abided by the armistice agreement. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has unilaterally reduced its military by 80,000 people, and the Chinese People's Volunteers have also voluntarily withdrawn from Korea. However, US imperialism continues to occupy South Korea and has turned South Korea into its atomic strategic base. It has also bankrupted the South Korean economy and turned it into a living hell. US imperialism and its lackeys are also frantically suppressing the people in South Korea. US imperialism is a beast in human skin.
    Jung Il-ryong said that the South Korean people have finally launched a struggle against US imperialism and its lackeys and drove Syngman Rhee off the stage. But US imperialism has instructed its new lackey, Huh Jung, to suppress the people. The South Korean people can only realize their demands for a new politics, a new life, and a new system by driving away US imperialism. The South Korean people clearly know where the root of all disasters lies, and they have increasingly launched a struggle against US imperialism.
    He pointed out that US imperialism is openly preparing for a new war, creating the US-Japan military alliance treaty, which seriously threatens peace in the Far East and the world, and more clearly exposes the wolfish nature of US imperialism. Jung Il-ryong emphasized that the Korean people must always maintain a high degree of vigilance and fight to the end with all peace-loving people in the world to crush the war conspiracy of US imperialism.
    Jung Il-ryong said, we once again seriously warn US imperialism that US troops must immediately withdraw from South Korea; and resolutely demand that US imperialism withdraw its aggressor troops from Taiwan, Japan, and South Vietnam. He said that the current task of the Korean people is to drive US imperialism out of South Korea. The people of North Korea must work hard to strengthen the revolutionary democratic base for this purpose. He called on the South Korean people to wage a more resolute struggle to realize consultation between North and South Korea and to drive out US troops.
    Workers, peasants, youth and students, representatives of the People's Army, and representatives from all walks of life spoke at the meeting.
    Worker representative Kim Jong-yeop and peasant representative Jang Sun-jun, in their speeches, emphasized that they would support the struggle of the South Korean people by increasing production. They said that the Korean people should strengthen their unity with the people of Asia, Africa, and the world to jointly oppose US imperialism.
    People's Army representative Lee Chun said in his speech at the meeting that the Korean People's Army is vigilantly guarding the outpost of the motherland and defending the victorious achievements of socialism. If US imperialism forgets the disastrous defeat it suffered in the war of aggression against Korea and dares to provoke a new war, it will suffer an even more disastrous annihilating blow than in the past.
    Mahmoud Babbika Gafar, head of the World Federation of Democratic Youth delegation, and Zamar George, head of the International Student Union delegation, who were invited to attend the meeting, also spoke at the meeting. They expressed their support for the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland and the just struggle of the South Korean people.
    After the meeting, a demonstration was held. The mighty crowd marched through the main streets of Pyongyang. The roar of "US troops get out!" resounded throughout Pyongyang.

    朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义侵略的祖国解放战争十周年前夕
    平壤三十万人反美大示威
    怀着深仇巨恨，发出震天怒吼：美国强盗滚出南朝鲜
    新华社平壤24日电　在“六·二五”朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义侵略的祖国解放战争十周年前夕，平壤市三十万人今天下午在金日成广场举行大会和示威，要美国侵略军立即从南朝鲜滚出去。
    同一天下午，在朝鲜北半部的海州、清津、沙里院、开城和其他大城市也举行了同样的大会和示威。
    对美帝国主义怀着深仇巨恨的平壤市人民，拿着讽刺美帝国主义在远东各国人民的打击下狼狈万状的漫画，举着巨大的横幅标语来参加大会，在这些横幅上写着：“朝鲜人民的死敌——美帝国主义从南朝鲜滚出去！”“揭露和粉碎全世界人类的凶恶的敌人美帝国主义的战争挑衅阴谋！”“亚非人民团结起来反对美帝国主义！”“打倒许政卖国集团”“南北朝鲜政党社会团体代表早日聚集一堂！”等。三十万人不断振臂高呼口号，“美军滚出去！”的吼声震天动地。
    下午六时，朝鲜劳动党和政府的领导人金一、洪命熹、朴金喆、南日、郑准泽和各民主政党、社会团体的负责人登上主席台。
    朝鲜内阁副首相、平壤市人民委员会委员长郑一龙在大会上讲了话。他指出，十年前美帝国主义发动侵朝战争，制造了历史上罕见的野蛮的暴行，又一次在世界人民面前暴露了帝国主义的本质。他说，但是朝鲜人民并没有屈服，由于朝鲜人民军的英勇战斗，中国人民派出了由优秀儿女组成的中国人民志愿军以鲜血援助了朝鲜人民，最后把美帝国主义打得跪下来在停战协定上签了字，使它在历史上遭到了第一次惨败。这证明了，只有人民团结起来进行顽强的斗争，才能战胜敌人。朝鲜人民的历史性的胜利对远东和世界和平作出了巨大的贡献。
    郑一龙说，停战七年来，朝鲜北方完全医好了战争创伤，建成了有独立的民族经济基础的工业—农业国家。朝鲜人民正以千里马的气概继续前进。他指出，朝鲜北部在社会主义建设中取得的辉煌成就是和平统一祖国的物质保证。
    他说，停战以后，朝中方面严格遵守了停战协定，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国并单方面裁军八万人，中国人民志愿军也主动撤出了朝鲜。但是美帝国主义却继续强占着南朝鲜，并把南朝鲜变为它的原子战略基地。它还使南朝鲜经济破产，成了人间地狱。美帝国主义及其走狗在南朝鲜还疯狂地镇压人民。美帝国主义就是披着人皮的野兽。
    郑一龙说，南朝鲜人民终于掀起了反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争，把李承晚赶下了台。但是美帝国主义又指使它的新走狗许政对人民进行镇压。南朝鲜人民只有赶走美帝国主义，才能实现他们的新政治、新生活、新制度的要求。南朝鲜人民清楚地知道一切灾难的根源在那里，他们日益高涨地掀起了反对美帝国主义的斗争。
    他指出，美帝国主义正露骨地准备新战争，制造了日美军事同盟条约，严重地威胁着远东和世界的和平，更加清楚地暴露了美帝国主义的狼的本性。郑一龙强调，朝鲜人民要经常地保持高度的警惕性，为粉碎美帝国主义的战争阴谋，同全世界爱好和平的人民一起斗争到底。
    郑一龙说，我们再一次严重警告美帝国主义，美军必须立即从南朝鲜撤走；并且坚决要求美帝国主义从台湾、日本、南越撤走它的侵略军。他说，当前朝鲜人民的任务就是要从南朝鲜赶走美帝国主义。朝鲜北部人民为此要努力加强革命的民主基地。他号召南朝鲜人民要为实现南北朝鲜之间的协商、为赶走美军进行更坚决的斗争。
    接着在大会上讲话的有工人、农民、青年学生等各界人民的代表、人民军代表等。
    工人代表金正烨和农民代表张善俊讲话时，强调要以增加生产来支援南朝鲜人民的斗争。他们说，朝鲜人民要加强同亚洲、非洲和全世界人民的团结，共同反对美帝国主义。
    朝鲜人民军代表李曾在大会上讲话时说，朝鲜人民军警惕地守卫在祖国的前哨，保卫着社会主义的胜利果实。如果美帝国主义忘记了在侵朝战争中遭到的惨败，胆敢挑起新战争，它就要遭到比过去更惨的歼灭性打击。
    应邀参加大会的世界民主青年联盟代表团团长马哈茂德·巴比卡·加法尔和国际学生联合会代表团团长扎马尔·乔治在大会上也讲了话。他们表示支持朝鲜人民和平统一祖国的斗争和南朝鲜人民的正义斗争。
    大会后还举行了示威。浩浩荡荡的群众队伍走过平壤的各主要街道。“美军滚出去！”的吼声响彻平壤全城。
