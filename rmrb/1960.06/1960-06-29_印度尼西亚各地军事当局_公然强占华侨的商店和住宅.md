Xinhua News Agency, 28th, Jakarta: Concurrent with powerful Indonesian groups stirring up another large-scale anti-Chinese persecution and eviction campaign in West Java, incidents of unreasonable seizure of small shops of Overseas Chinese forced to close down and residences of Overseas Chinese forced to move or return to China continue to occur in various parts of Indonesia.

The relevant military authorities in West Java issued instructions on April 14 to the Bandung military authorities to "supervise" and "control" the houses of Overseas Chinese leaving the country, and immediately seal the houses and buildings of foreigners leaving the Bandung area. The East Java military authorities also issued regulations on April 11, stipulating that all foreigners must report to the military authorities before leaving the country and hand over the keys of their houses to the military authorities, otherwise they will be sentenced to one year in prison or fined up to 50,000 rupiah.

Such acts of plundering the legal property of Overseas Chinese are particularly serious in Bandung and its surrounding areas. To date, more than 80% of the houses of Overseas Chinese who have completed the procedures for returning to China have been sealed. The wartime commander of Xiboliangan Prefecture (Bandung city belongs to this prefecture) also summoned twenty people living in houses formerly owned by Overseas Chinese on June 23, ordering them to move out of these houses within a week. This is effectively preventing Overseas Chinese from freely transferring or selling their houses. At the same time, some Indonesian soldiers in West Java often unreasonably seize the residences of Overseas Chinese. Some Overseas Chinese families live together. When one family returns to China, the empty rooms are forcibly occupied by soldiers. An Overseas Chinese in Bangju Street, Bandung City, was beaten for disagreeing with this act of military occupation. One Overseas Chinese family has sixteen or seventeen members, nine of whom have returned to China, and part of his house has also been sealed.

In the areas of Cimawei, Lianwang, and Mazhela Ye, which belong to Bandung County and are currently undergoing large-scale forced relocation of Overseas Chinese, all the houses inhabited by Overseas Chinese have been sealed and are not allowed to be sold.

In addition, at the end of May, in various parts of the Rili Xili Leng County in northern Sumatra, soldiers continued to seize shops and residences of Overseas Chinese in the name of "cooperatives." The "cooperatives" in Matabao and Limailei areas under the jurisdiction of Shalangwuya District of this county wanted to seize nine shops of Overseas Chinese. The Overseas Chinese filed an appeal on May 23. On the 28th, an officer from the Dingyi garrison interrogated the appellants, threatening to detain them and sue them. Harun, a sergeant from the Bagan garrison in Rili Xili Leng County, arbitrarily ordered six local Overseas Chinese on May 30 to hand over their shops on June 1, otherwise they would be beaten. The representative of the Xinbangdijia garrison also forced an Overseas Chinese to hand over the shop to the "cooperative," otherwise he would be arrested.

These small vendors of Overseas Chinese who are forced to close down and lose their livelihoods originally combined shops and homes. If the shops are seized, they have nowhere to live. The Chinese Consulate in Medan has repeatedly requested the relevant authorities to handle these incidents of seizure of shops, but such incidents continue to occur. This practice of openly plundering the legal houses of Overseas Chinese in disregard of international norms has caused panic and indignation among the broad masses of Overseas Chinese. They hope that the authorities will quickly stop this anti-Chinese behavior and quickly make reasonable arrangements for the Overseas Chinese properties that have been occupied.

    印度尼西亚各地军事当局
    公然强占华侨的商店和住宅
    万隆地区有30％以上已办完回国手续的华侨住屋被贴上封条，日里习里冷县军方竟以扣留、逮捕等威胁手段迫使华侨交出房产。
    新华社28日讯　雅加达消息：和印度尼西亚有势力集团在西爪哇再次掀起大规模排华迫迁活动的同时，印度尼西亚各地又不断发生无理强占被迫停业的华侨小商店和被迫迁的或回国华侨的住宅的事件。
    西爪哇有关军事当局曾在4月14日训令万隆军事当局必须“监督”和“控制”将离境的华侨的房屋，并立即标封即将离开万隆地区的外侨的房屋和建筑物，东爪哇军事当局也曾在4月11日颁布条例，规定所有外侨在离境前必须向军事当局报告，并将房屋的钥匙交给军事当局，否则将处以一年徒刑或五万盾以下的罚款。
    万隆市和所属地区这种掠夺华侨合法财产的事情特别严重，到目前为止，已有80％以上已办完回国手续的华侨的住屋被贴上封条。西勃良安州（万隆市属于这个州）的战时掌权者在6月23日还传讯了住在原先华侨所有的房子里的二十个人，限令他们一星期内迁出这些屋子。这实际上就等于不准华侨自由出顶或出让房屋。同时西爪哇印度尼西亚的一些军人还往往无理强占华侨住宅。有些华侨几家人住在一起，其中一家回国后空下来的房间就被军人强行迁入。万隆市邦居街的一个华侨因为不同意军人这种霸占行为而被殴打。有一个华侨全家十六七口人，其中九人回国，而他家的房子的一部分也被标封。
    在属于万隆县的最近正在大规模强迫华侨迁移的芝马圩、连旺和马者拉夜等地，所有华侨居住的房子，都被贴上封条，不准出卖。
    此外5月底，在苏门答腊北部的日里习里冷县属下各地，也接连发生军人以“合作社”名义强占华侨店铺和住宅的事情。这个县沙浪武亚区属下的马打堡、里麦里也两地的“合作社”要强占华侨九家店铺，华侨在5月23日呈文上诉，28日丁宜的驻军的一个军官又传问上诉人，向他们大叫大喊地威胁说要扣留他们，叫他们吃官司。日里习里冷县吧敢的驻军上士哈隆5月30日蛮横地限令当地六家华侨在6月1日交出他们的店屋，如不搬就要打。新邦帝加驻军代表也强令一个华侨把店屋交给“合作社”，否则将逮捕他。
    这些被迫停业、失去生计的华侨小商贩，原来就是店和家合而为一的，如果店铺被强占就无栖身之地。中国驻棉兰领事馆曾多次向有关当局提请处理这种强占店铺的事件，但这种事件仍然继续不断发生。这种无视国际准则，对华侨合法的房屋进行公然抢夺的作法，已引起广大华侨的恐慌和愤慨，他们希望当局迅速停止这种排华行为，并对已被占用的华侨房产迅速作出合理的处理。
