　　Building the Motherland by Leaping on the Chollima; Drive the American Imperialists out of South Korea
　　Yuan Mingchun, Worker at the Ryongsong Machine Factory, Korea
　　Today is the tenth anniversary of the American imperialist cannibals of the 20th century launching a war of aggression against the Korean and Chinese people in Korea.

　　The war ended with the victory of the Korean and Chinese people. However, our struggle against American imperialism has not stopped. With the determination to avenge our parents and brothers, and with the determination to drive the American imperialists, the mortal enemy of the Korean people, out of South Korea, we began to build a new life on the ruins. Seven years later, with the fraternal assistance of the people of the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries, we have built the northern half of the Republic into a socialist industrial and agricultural country. Everywhere on this land, where the outstanding sons and daughters of China and Korea shed their precious blood, a new life is being established.

　　When we first arrived at the Ryongsong Machine Factory from the air raid shelters, just after the armistice, with a few old lathes and two or three heavy machines, there were piles of broken bricks and tiles, and bomb craters everywhere with frogs croaking. It was in such a place that we began construction. We were determined: "No matter what, we must work selflessly, we must build magnificent factories and a better life on this land where the martyrs shed their blood." At that time, I painfully recalled the scene of American planes bombing our factory. That day, just as I was about to go to work, swarms of planes bombed the factory. When my comrades and I braved the planes' strafing to rush to the factory, it was already completely destroyed. Comrades swallowed their tears and jumped into the raging fire to rescue the machines. The young people swore revenge on the spot and went to the front lines. We who remained at the factory dismantled the remaining machines and carried them to caves hundreds of miles away to continue production.

　　After the armistice, with the spirit of victors, we spent only three months restoring the electric furnace that had been lying on the ground, riddled with holes by American imperialism. We smelted steel, manufactured tower cranes, produced lathes and drilling machines, and then produced heavy machinery, and started the factory.

　　The vile American wolves thought that the Korean people would never stand up again. However, life completely overturned their delusions. We established a foundry workshop, restored the machine workshop, so that the products of the Ryongsong Machine Factory were continuously sent to iron and steel mills, steel plants, power stations... Finally, we even built our own eight-meter vertical lathe. Now we are starting to manufacture a 3,000-ton hydraulic press.

　　Like the factory, the face of life has also changed. On the desolate ruins of the old residential area overgrown with weeds, a beautiful factory city was built in the blink of an eye. Facing the vast East Sea, nestled among the green pines and cypresses of the low-lying Kowloon Mountains, our workers' residences, some are two-story buildings, some are four- or five-story buildings, totaling more than 1,700 households. The whitewashed houses are like sanatoriums, row upon row facing the seaside. I am an ordinary worker, and I also live in a beautiful cultural residence where I can see the sea in the front and fruit trees in the back.

　　As we completely healed the wounds of war and galloped towards the socialist and communist highlands with the momentum of double Chollima, we thought even more of the South Korean people who are still groaning under the atrocities of American imperialism. The South Korean workers who continue to fight for survival and democratic rights after driving away the traitor Syngman Rhee must live a happy life like us. Whether it is a family or a nation, we must live together, even if it means going hungry and cold. How can we not think of our South Korean brothers when we are living a prosperous life?

　　As we welcome the tenth anniversary of "June 25th," we are continuing to ignite the flames of increased production even higher in response to the Party's call, in order to achieve the peaceful reunification of the motherland as soon as possible. We are convinced that this is the only way to drive out the American imperialists entrenched in South Korea and Taiwan.

　　American imperialism was, is, and will continue to be our enemy. If it were not for the American imperialist aggressor troops, we would have been unified long ago, and the South Korean people would have been able to live like us long ago. Taiwan would have been liberated long ago.

　　The American imperialists must get out of South Korea, out of Taiwan, out of Asia. Korea has defeated American imperialism side by side with the Chinese people in the past, and will continue to fight in the future to drive the last American out of the Asian region.

    跨千里马建设祖国　从南朝鲜赶走美帝
   朝鲜龙城机械工厂工人　元明淳
    今天是二十世纪吃人生番美帝国主义者反对朝鲜人民和中国人民，在朝鲜发动侵略战争的十周年。
    战争以朝中人民的胜利结束了。但是我们反对美帝国主义者的斗争并没有中断，我们以替父母兄弟报仇的心情，以从南朝鲜赶走朝鲜人民的死敌美帝国主义的决心，在废墟上开始建设新生活。七年后的今天，我们在苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家人民的兄弟般的援助下，把共和国北半部建成了社会主义的工农业国家，在朝中两国人民的优秀儿女撒下了宝贵的鲜血的这块土地上，到处建立起新生活。
    当刚停战时，我们从防空洞里带着破旧的几台车床和两三台重型机械来到龙城机械工厂时，这里一堆破砖，那里一堆乱瓦，到处都是有青蛙呱呱叫的炸弹坑。就是在这样的地方，我们开始了建设。我们下了决心：“不管怎样，我们要忘我地劳动，我们要在烈士们撒下了鲜血的这块土地上建设起宏伟的工厂和美好的生活。这时候，我痛心地回忆起美国飞机大肆轰炸我们工厂的情景。那天，我正要去上班的时候，成群的飞机轰炸了工厂。当我和伙伴们冒着飞机的扫射赶到工厂一看，已经破坏得什么都没有了。同志们把眼泪咽到肚子里，跳进熊熊的烈火中抢救了机器，青年们当场宣誓报仇，上前线去了。我们留在工厂的人拆卸了剩下的机器，背到几百里以外的山洞里继续生产。
    停战后，我们以战胜者的气概仅用三个月的时间，就恢复了被美帝国主义炸得千疮百孔的倒在地上的电炉，炼出钢铁，制造了塔式起重机，生产了车床、钻床，又生产了重型机械，开始办了工厂。
    可恶的美国狼认为朝鲜人民再也站不起来了。但是，生活完全推翻了他们的妄想。我们成立了铸造车间，恢复了机械车间，使龙城机械工厂的产品源源不断地送到了制铁所，炼钢厂，发电站……。最后，我们还自造了八米立式车床。现在着手制造三千吨的水压机。
    同工厂一样，生活的面貌也改变了。在杂草丛生的旧住宅区的荒凉废墟上，转眼建成了美丽的工厂城市。面临苍茫的东海、座落在不高的九龙山上青松翠柏间的我们工人的住宅，有的是二层楼房，有的是四、五层楼房，共有一千七百多户。粉刷得白白的住宅好像休养所，一排排的面临着海滨。我是一个普通工人，也住在前面能看到海，后面有果树的漂亮的文化住宅里。
    当我们完全医好了战争创伤，以双匹千里马的气势向社会主义和共产主义高地奔驰的时候，更加想起了还在美帝国主义者的暴行下呻吟的南朝鲜人民。赶走了卖国贼李承晚后，为争取生存和民主权利而继续斗争的南朝鲜工人，必须同我们一样过幸福的生活。不论是一个家庭、还是一个民族，挨饿受冻也要在一起过日子，我们在过着富裕生活时，怎能不想着南朝鲜的兄弟呢？
    我们在迎接“六·二五”十周年的时候，为了早日实现祖国的和平统一，响应党的号召继续更高地燃起着增产的火焰，我们确信，只有这条道路才是赶走盘据在南朝鲜和台湾的美帝国主义的唯一的道路。
    美帝国主义者过去是、现在是、今后还是我们的敌人。如果不是美帝国主义侵略军，我们早就统一了，南朝鲜人民早已能过我们这样的日子了。台湾也早就解放了。
    美帝国主义者必须从南朝鲜、从台湾、从亚洲滚出去。朝鲜过去同中国人民并肩战胜了美帝国主义，今后要继续斗争，从亚洲地区赶走最后一个美国佬。
