Xinhua News Agency, Washington, June 10th: U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, Parsons, emphasized the U.S. must persist in its hostile policy towards China while testifying before the House of Representatives on the foreign aid appropriations bill.

During his testimony, he emphasized that the U.S. cannot "compromise" with China, and it has "only one choice" regarding China: to "continue to take necessary actions" to oppose China.

He emphasized that the U.S. will continue to provide "military and economic assistance" to so-called Asian "free countries" bordering China to control them into pursuing policies hostile to China. He said this is "urgently needed" because there is an "imbalance of power" between China and its surrounding countries. He advocated for maintaining a "well-prepared, trained army" in this region on a regular basis. He also said that the U.S. and its allies cannot "make any gestures that could be seen as weak or weary" on this point.

He also falsely accused China of "creating the border incidents with India." However, Parsons had to admit: "It seems clear that in the coming years, Communist China is likely to become one of the major powers in terms of overall economic power growth, especially in the growth of heavy industry." He admitted that it would be "foolish" to base policy on "the assumption of the collapse" of the Chinese People's regime.

    帕森斯再次暴露帝国主义凶恶面目
    强调美国坚持敌视中国的政策
    据新华社10日讯　华盛顿消息：美国远东事务助理国务卿帕森斯在众议院就援外拨款法案作证时强调美国要坚持敌视中国的政策。
    他在作证中强调美国是不可能同中国“妥协”的，它对中国“只有一个抉择”，即“必须继续采取必要的行动”来反对中国。
    他强调，美国将继续给同中国毗邻的所谓亚洲“自由国家”以“军事和经济援助”，来控制它们奉行敌视中国的政策。他说这是“迫切需要的”，因为中国同周围的国家之间“存在着力量的不平衡”。他鼓吹要在这个地区经常维持一支“作好准备的、受过训练的军队”。他还说，美国及其盟国在这一点上不能“作出任何会被认为是显得软弱或厌倦的姿态”。
    他还诬蔑中国“制造了同印度的边界事件”。但是，帕森斯不得不承认：“看来很清楚，在今后若干年内，就总的经济力量增长，特别是重工业的增长来说，共产党中国可能成为大国之一”。他承认，如果以中国人民政权“垮台的假定作为政策的基础，那将是愚蠢的”。
