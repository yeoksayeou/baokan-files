    Inspiring Fighting Spirit, Praising Labor
    ——Dance Performances in the National Worker's Art Festival
    You Huihai
    There are more than 150 dance programs in the National Worker's Art Festival. Their most important feature is their overflowing political enthusiasm, filled with the rhythm and atmosphere of the Great Leap Forward era. Many dance works use powerful artistic images and full political enthusiasm to praise the Party and Chairman Mao, praise the Three Red Banners, and praise the lofty communist spirit of the working class. From the magnificent and large-scale "Leap Forward Song and Dance" (Beijing Delegation) and "Leap Forward Drum" (Joint Performance by Delegations from Various Provinces and Cities), performed by hundreds of people, to small pieces like "Morning on the Hai River Bank" (Hebei Delegation), which expresses the people's happy life, all vividly and powerfully reflect the flying forward face of our motherland's socialist construction, and demonstrate the working class's optimistic and heroic spirit and great strength.
    The dance creations of the workers all come from the actual struggle life, so the content of the works is rich and diverse. For example, Fujian's "Capture the Enemy in the Deep Mountains," Anhui's "River Network Construction" and "New Daughter-in-Law Carrying Water to the Pond," Guizhou's "Miao People Entering the Factory," Gansu's "Power Plant Construction Site," and Inner Mongolia's "Steel Workers on the Grassland" all reflect the production and construction struggles of their respective regions. Guangdong's "Xiang Xiuli," Sichuan's "Liu Wenxue," Shanxi's "Sixty-One Class Brothers," and Tianjin's "Mu Chengrui" directly express the figures with the communist style. The performances of these works have all received good results, and the audience has been deeply educated. This proves that dance can very well reflect political and production struggles. The result of serving politics and production makes the dance more rich in profound thought and vivid content, and thus the program is more loved by the audience.
    Another prominent achievement of the dance programs in this festival is that they shape the image of the new working class through the expression of labor and reflection of production struggles. These dance works that express labor vividly summarize the characteristics of labor production, and at the same time show the ideological qualities and spiritual outlook of the workers in labor. Expressing labor is the essence of art, reflecting production struggles, and shaping the image of the working class is an important issue for us to develop dance creation. In this festival, many programs have gained successful experience in shaping the labor image of the new working class. For example, "Skillful Girls" captures the characteristic movements of female textile workers in the spinning mill in their work, and also shows a group of dexterous, optimistic, and lively textile workers. "Heroic Miners" extracts many production-characteristic movements from the miners' underground work, and at the same time, through production automation, shows the miners' soaring enthusiasm. "Steel Red Banner Team" not only expresses the workers' enthusiasm in front of the furnace, but also expresses the struggle in labor—overcoming difficulties and rescuing the steel furnace. The reason why these works are successful is mainly because they reflect the working class's revolutionary spirit and spiritual qualities, and the working class's revolutionary drive through labor. This is the valuable experience of the current dance expressing the working class's labor image. These programs look so moving because what we feel in the works is not its labor form and labor process, but the vivid image of the workers' fighting will, optimism, and resourcefulness.
    The workers' rich and colorful dance works are all created by fully utilizing the nation's precious folk heritage. The distinctive programs of each province, city, and region form a colorful picture. The workers creatively absorbed and applied the traditional heritage of their own regions, and many dances have been warmly welcomed by the audience because of their rich local characteristics and distinct national characteristics. However, the workers are not limited and bound by form in their creation, but create a variety of expressive forms according to the needs of the subject matter, including pure dance forms, song and dance, and more diverse comprehensive forms (such as the combination of clapper talk, recitation, singing, and dance). This creative combination and application of various forms has only one purpose and task, that is, to better and more directly express the content, and to serve politics and production. The moving content and full emotions of these works make people feel kind.
    Many programs have many new creations on the basis of inheriting the traditional heritage, and successfully exerted the expressive power and characteristics of the dance art image. Many programs vividly and powerfully express the ideological nature of the work through many original imaginations and creations. Many works with very good ideological content are rich in moving artistic images. Like Hunan's "Big Bang Opening Red," it is a very imaginative work by showing workers galloping, opening big locks, and steel flowing, expressing the opening red's production enthusiasm. Yunnan's "Ten Thousand Red Lights" expresses the artistic conception of a hundred flowers blooming and thriving under the illumination of the Three Red Banners through the beautiful dance image of the lights shining. Others such as Jiangxi's lantern picking "Long Live the Communist Party," Shaanxi's "The Statistician is Too Busy," Beijing's "Heroic Master and Apprentice," etc. are all very expressive dance creations.
    We can also see that many works have revolutionary romanticist fantasy elements: Heilongjiang's "Spring Returning Goose" attempts to express the changes in Heilongjiang from the Great Northern Wilderness to the Great Northern Granary by describing the emotions of the goose flock going south and returning north. Guizhou's "Wanbao Mountain" attempts to express the life of geological prospectors through the imaginary image of underground treasures, which is also an imaginative romanticist technique. Rich imagination is a valuable factor in artistic creation. It will enable our creation to more powerfully reflect our revolutionary enthusiasm and revolutionary ideals on the basis of highly summarizing reality. Many creations of the workers have these characteristics. This is very gratifying. Many characteristics and strengths of the workers in creation are due to their distinct class views and class feelings, and their rich practical experience and knowledge. This is also what our professional dancers should learn from them.
    In this festival, the worker's dance creations, which reflect our era, praise our era, and promote our era, and have strong combativeness, have shown great achievements. It is believed that in the future, these vanguards standing on the production and construction front will continue to create more and better artistic works that inspire the people and educate the people, just like their great contributions in the labor struggle!

    鼓舞斗志　赞美劳动
    ——全国职工文艺会演中的舞蹈演出
    游惠海
    在全国职工文艺会演中有一百五十多个舞蹈节目。它们的最主要特色是政治热情洋溢，充满了大跃进时代的节奏和气息。有许多舞蹈作品以有力的艺术形象和饱满的政治热情，歌颂党和毛主席，歌颂三面红旗，歌颂工人阶级崇高的共产主义精神。大至气势雄壮、规模宏大的数百人演出的“跃进歌舞”（北京代表团）和“跃进鼓”（各省市代表团联合演出），小至像表现人民幸福生活的小品“海河畔上的早晨”（河北代表团），都以鲜明有力的形象反映了我们祖国社会主义建设飞跃前进的面貌，表现了工人阶级乐观豪迈的精神和伟大的力量。
    职工的舞蹈创作都是来自实际的斗争生活，因此作品的内容丰富多样。例如福建的表现对敌斗争的“深山擒敌”，安徽的“河网化”和“新媳妇挑塘”，贵州的“苗家进工厂”，甘肃的“电厂工地”，内蒙古的“草原上的钢铁工人”等节目，它的具体内容都是反映本地区的生产建设斗争。广东的“向秀丽”，四川的“刘文学”，山西的“六十一个阶级兄弟”，天津的“穆成瑞”都直接地表现了共产主义风格的人物。这些作品的演出，都收到了很好的效果，使观众受到了深刻的教育。这就证明了舞蹈是能够很好地反映政治和生产斗争的。为政治为生产服务的结果，使舞蹈更富有深刻的思想和生动的内容，因而节目就更为观众所喜爱。
    这次会演中的舞蹈节目，还有一个突出的成就，就是通过表现劳动，反映生产斗争塑造了新的工人阶级的形象。这些表现劳动的舞蹈作品，生动地概括了劳动生产的特征，同时又表现了工人们在劳动中的思想品质和精神面貌。表现劳动，这是艺术的本质，反映生产斗争，塑造工人阶级的形象，这是我们发展舞蹈创作的重要课题。这次会演中已有不少节目在塑造新的工人阶级的劳动形象方面取得了成功的经验。例如：“巧姑娘”就概括地抓住了纱厂纺织女工在劳动中富有特征的动作，而又表现出一群心灵手巧、乐观活泼的纺织工人的形象。“英雄的矿工”从矿工井下的劳动中提炼了许多具有生产特征的动作，同时又通过生产自动化，表现了矿工们的冲天干劲。“钢铁红旗班”不仅表现了工人们在炉前生产的热情，而且还表现了在劳动中的斗争——克服困难，抢救钢炉。这些作品之所以成功，主要是因为它们通过劳动反映了工人阶级的革命气概和精神品质，反映了工人阶级的革命干劲，这是目前表现工人阶级劳动形象的舞蹈的宝贵经验。这些节目看起来是那样的动人，因为我们在作品里感受到的不是它的劳动形式和劳动过程，而是作品中所表现出来的活生生的工人的斗争意志、乐观主义和机智勇敢的生动形象。
    职工们丰富多彩的舞蹈作品，都是充分运用了民族的民间宝贵遗产来进行创作的。各个省、市、地区的各有特色的节目形成了色彩缤纷的图景。职工们创造性地吸收运用了自己地区的传统遗产，许多舞蹈由于具有浓郁的地方特色和鲜明的民族特点，因而得到了观众的热烈欢迎。但是职工们在创作中并不受形式的限制和束缚，而是根据题材内容的需要，创造了多种多样的表现形式，既有纯粹的舞蹈形式，也有载歌载舞，更有多种多样的综合形式（像快板、朗诵、歌唱、舞蹈的结合）。这种创造性的多种形式的结合和运用只有一个目的和任务，就是为了更好地更直接地表现内容，为政治为生产服务。这些作品动人的内容和饱满的情绪使人感到亲切。
    许多节目在继承传统遗产的基础上有了许多新的创造，成功地发挥了舞蹈艺术形象的表现力和特点。许多节目通过许多独出心裁的想像和创造，许多舞蹈鲜明有力地表达了作品的思想性。许多思想内容很好的作品都是富有动人的艺术形象。像湖南“大闹开门红”，通过工人们万马奔腾，打开大锁，钢水奔流，表现了开门红的生产干劲，就是很有想像力的作品。云南的“万盏红灯”通过灯花辉映的美丽的舞蹈形象，表现了在三面红旗照耀下百花齐放，欣欣向荣的意境。其他像江西的灯采“共产党万岁”、陕西的“忙坏了统计员”、北京的“师徒英雄”等等都是很有表现力的舞蹈创作。
    我们还可以看到许多作品具有革命浪漫主义的幻想因素：黑龙江的“春归雁”就是企图通过描写南去北归的雁群的情感来表现黑龙江由北大荒到北大仓的变化。贵州的“万宝山”企图通过地下宝藏的幻想形象来表现地质勘探者的生活，这也是富于想像力的浪漫主义手法。丰富的想像，这是艺术创作的宝贵因素，它将使我们的创作在高度概括现实的基础上更有力地反映出我们的革命热情和革命理想。职工们的许多创作都具有了这样的特点。这是很可喜的。职工们在创作上的许多特点和长处，都是由于他们具有鲜明的阶级观点和阶级情感、具有丰富的实际斗争经验和知识所带来的，这也是我们专业舞蹈工作者要向他们学习的。
    在这次会演中，反映了我们的时代，歌颂了我们的时代，促进了我们的时代，具有强烈战斗性的职工舞蹈创作，已显示了巨大的成就。相信今后这些站在生产建设战线上的尖兵们，一定会像他们在劳动斗争中的伟大贡献一样，将在艺术上继续创作出更多、更好的鼓舞人民、教育人民的艺术作品！
