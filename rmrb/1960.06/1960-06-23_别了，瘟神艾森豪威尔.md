    Farewell, Plague God Eisenhower
    Qian Junrui
    Today's number one executioner and plague god, Eisenhower, has ended his nine-day Far East trip and returned in dismay, his nerves still on edge. All Asian people should be extremely grateful to this American president, who, before leaving office, still did not hesitate to travel thousands of miles to act as an extremely competent negative example, and also gave hundreds of millions of Asian people a very good opportunity for rehearsal. And we know that the people, the people's struggle, cannot achieve victory without the correct guidance of positive teachers and the constant pressure and repeated verification of negative teachers, and without repeated on-the-spot exercises of struggle.
    Underestimating the power of the people and overestimating one's own power are common characteristics of all bourgeois reactionaries with a idealistic view of history. Eisenhower is naturally no exception. Although his warmongering face has been repeatedly exposed, he still pretended to be a messenger of peace when he came to the Far East, with a pocket full of "freedom," "justice," "peace," "dignity," "democracy," "government of the people, by the people, for the people," "cooperation," "aid," "friendly relations" and other series of magic weapons to deceive people. At the same time, he mobilized three armies and the entire team of secret agents to scare people. This number one representative of U.S. imperialism, relying on his idealistic view of history, actually believed that he could deceive the Asian people and suppress the Asian people. Therefore, he brazenly ignored all opposition and came to the other side of the Pacific with a stiff neck and a brazen face. But what was the result? The result is:
    When he went to the Philippines, the Filipino people responded with strikes and stones.
    When he went to Taiwan, the Chinese people welcomed him and sent him off with an armed demonstration of ten thousand cannons firing in unison.
    When he went to Korea, the Korean people overthrew his loyal dog Syngman Rhee.
    His main intention was to go to Japan to support Nobusuke Kishi. However, the heroic Japanese people gave him a solid cold shoulder; his servant Nobusuke Kishi became even more tottering as a result.
    This negative teacher used his wonderful teaching method to give the Asian people and the world people several profound lessons.
    He used "talks," "joint communiques," "inspections," "conversations," "strengthening military deployment" and other methods to prove to people that the gangster nature of U.S. imperialism has not changed at all, but has intensified; U.S. imperialism is indeed the common enemy of the Asian people, the common enemy of the people of the world, and Eisenhower himself is indeed the most loyal and authoritative representative of U.S. imperialism. The Pentagon is merely a tool of American monopoly capital and its representative, Plague God Eisenhower, and not the other way around.
    Eisenhower used his actual actions to seriously "educate" people: the people should not harbor any unrealistic illusions about U.S. imperialism and Plague God Eisenhower himself. If anyone has such illusions (such as insisting that the nature of imperialism has changed, that Eisenhower is a messenger of peace, etc.), then this American president very timely uses various acts of war provocation and aggression that can express his imperialist nature to ruthlessly shatter this illusion.
    This American president also used his helpless change of original plans (regarding the visit to Japan) and his expression of "regret" (regarding the artillery bombardment of the Chinese People's Liberation Army) and other methods to particularly powerfully "educate" the Asian people and the people of the world: the power of the people is after all the decisive factor, and as long as the people unite and carry out a strong and unyielding struggle, they will be able to smash all the conspiracies of imperialism, and will be able to frustrate and subdue imperialism, until imperialism is eliminated.
    Is this "teacher" Eisenhower's education of the people limited to this? Has he finally admitted defeat and is willing to stop making trouble? No! Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until final destruction—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries. Neither Eisenhower, nor Rockefeller, nor any Republican or Democratic successor president will act contrary to this logic. Haven't we heard? U.S. imperialism is now loudly clamoring, blaming the disastrous defeat of Eisenhower's Far East trip on the so-called "threat of communism" and the so-called "threat of China." This is a blatant lie of U.S. imperialism and a forecast that they will continue to carry out new conspiracies. U.S. imperialism vainly attempts to use these worthless old prescriptions to undermine the internal unity of the people of Asian countries and undermine the unity between the Chinese people and the people of Asian countries. In addition, we must also pay attention to the fact that Plague God Eisenhower's failure to visit Japan was his biggest failure. However, at the same time, we should also estimate that, in order to effectively maintain its own interests, U.S. imperialism may completely sacrifice Nobusuke Kishi and replace him with another puppet, just as they secretly used Huh Chung to replace Syngman Rhee in South Korea, to deceive the Japanese people.
    Here, it is beneficial for us to take a look at the traitorous face of the Yugoslav modern revisionists. In recent days, the Tito clique has continued to clamor and put makeup on U.S. imperialism. They said that if it were not for the recent changes in the world situation, Eisenhower would have been "warmly received" in Japan and would have had "many comforting words for the suffering Japanese people." (June 18 "Politika") They said that the American president's visit to Japan was to implement "the policy of the American government at that time of easing tensions and resolving disputes through the rule of law." (June 18 "Borba") They even engaged in shameless provocation and intimidation against the just struggle of the Japanese people, saying that "by closing the door to President Eisenhower, the demonstrators insulted a nation whose people will not forgive them, and the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty will take effect even without ratification." (June 17 "Borba") This is truly the face of a U.S. imperialist running dog! While opposing U.S. imperialism, we must thoroughly crush modern revisionism—can there still be any doubt about this?
    The Chinese people, the Asian people, and the people of the world will all receive profound and beneficial education from this robber trip of Eisenhower, and further clearly recognize that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world, that U.S. imperialism is indeed a paper tiger; recognize clearly that only the power of the people's unity, only the people's struggle, is the decisive factor in achieving victory against U.S. imperialism's policy of war and aggression, and in defending world peace. And all of this proves, in the most precise sense, the brilliance and greatness of the thought of our people's great leader, Comrade Mao Zedong.

    别了，瘟神艾森豪威尔
    钱俊瑞
    当今天字第一号刽子手、瘟神艾森豪威尔，结束了他的为期九天的远东之行，带着惊魂余悸废然而返了。全亚洲人民应当十分感谢这位美国总统，他在快要卸任之前，竟还不辞辛劳、万里迢迢而来，充当一阵极为称职的反面教员，而且还给几亿亚洲人民以一个非常好的演习机会。而我们知道，人民，人民的斗争，如果不是既有正面教员的正确引导，又有反面教员的不断逼迫和反复证实，如果不作多次斗争的实地演习，是不可能取得胜利的。
    对人民力量估计过低，对自身力量估计过高，这是一切具有唯心主义历史观的资产阶级反动派的共同特征。艾森豪威尔自然不是例外。尽管他的战争贩子的真面目已经一再为人们所识破，但是他此番来到远东，还是装作和平使者的样子，满口袋装着“自由”、“正义”、“和平”、“尊严”、“民治”、“民享”、“合作”、“援助”、“友好联系”等等一连串法宝，借以骗人。同时，又出动三军和全班特务人马，借以吓人。这位美帝国主义的头号代表，凭着他的唯心历史观，竟然相信他是能够骗得过亚洲人民和压得下亚洲人民的。因而他就悍然不顾一切反对，硬着头皮，老着脸皮来到了太平洋的彼岸。但是，结果怎样呢？结果是：
    他到菲律宾，菲律宾人民报之以罢工斗争和石块。
    他到台湾，中国人民迎之送之以万炮齐轰的武装大示威。
    他到朝鲜，朝鲜人民打倒了他的忠实走狗李承晚。
    他最主要的心思是去日本、支撑岸信介。但是，英勇的日本人民却给了他以一瓢结结实实的闭门羹；他的奴仆岸信介就随之而更加摇摇欲坠了。
    这位反面教员用他绝妙的教学法，给亚洲人民、给世界人民上了好几堂意义深长的课。
    他用“会谈”、“联合公报”、“视察”、“谈话”、“加强军事布置”等等方式，向人们证明：美帝国主义的强盗本性丝毫没有改变，而且变本加厉了；美帝国主义确确实实是亚洲人民的共同敌人，是全世界人民的共同敌人，而艾森豪威尔本人确确实实是美帝国主义的最忠实最有权威的代表。五角大楼只是美国垄断资本及其代表艾瘟神的工具，而决不是相反。
    艾森豪威尔用他的实际行动，认真地“教育”了人们：人民对美帝国主义、对艾瘟神本人，决不应该存有任何不切实际的幻想。如果有人存有这种幻想（比如硬说什么帝国主义的本性已经改变了，艾森豪威尔是和平使者之类），那么这位美国总统就非常及时地用各种的能够表现他的帝国主义本性的战争挑衅和侵略行动来狠狠地打破这种幻想。
    这位美国总统又用他的无可奈何的改变原定计划（对访问日本）和表示“遗憾”（对中国人民解放军的炮轰迎送）等等方式，特别强有力地“教育”亚洲人民和全世界人民：人民的力量毕竟是决定的因素，人民只要团结起来，进行坚强不屈的斗争，就能够粉碎帝国主义的一切阴谋，就能够挫败和制服帝国主义，直到消灭帝国主义。
    艾森豪威尔这位“教员”对人民的教育仅止于此了吗？他已经最后认输，甘心不再来捣乱了吗？不！捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直到最后灭亡，这是帝国主义和一切反动派的逻辑。不论艾森豪威尔也好，洛克菲勒也好，以及任何共和党和民主党的继任总统也好，他们都不会违反这个逻辑行事的。我们没有听见么？美帝国主义现在正大声嚷嚷，把艾森豪威尔远东之行的惨败归咎于所谓“共产主义的威胁”，归咎于所谓“中国的威胁”。这是美帝国主义的漫天大谎，也是他们继续要进行新阴谋的预告。美帝国主义妄图用这些分文不值的老单方，来破坏亚洲各国人民内部的团结，破坏中国人民和亚洲各国人民之间的团结。此外，我们还要注意，艾瘟神没有去成日本，这是他的最大失败。但是，同时我们还应该估计到，美帝国主义为了有效地保持他自身的利益，完全可能牺牲岸信介，而另换一个傀儡来接替他，正像在南朝鲜他们暗中用许政来接替李承晚一样，来欺骗日本人民。
    在这里，我们捎带地来看看南斯拉夫现代修正主义的叛徒嘴脸，是有益的。铁托集团这几天来继续鼓噪，为美帝国主义搽粉。他们说要不是最近世界局势的改变，艾森豪威尔到日本，“就会受到热烈的接待，对受尽痛苦的日本人有许多安慰的话。”（6月18日“政治报”）说什么美国总统访问日本，是要实行“美国政府那时所要的缓和与通过法制来解决争端的政策”。（6月18日“战斗报”）他们甚至对日本人民的正义斗争进行无耻的挑拨和恫吓，说什么“由于向艾森豪威尔总统关闭了大门，游行示威者就侮辱了一国的人民，该国人民是不会宽恕他们的，而美日安全条约即使不经批准也将生效。”（6月17日“战斗报”）这真是道道地地的美帝国主义的走狗嘴脸！在反对美帝国主义的同时，我们必须彻底粉碎现代修正主义，这难道还能怀疑么？
    中国人民、亚洲人民、全世界人民，都会从这次艾森豪威尔的强盗旅行中受到深刻有益的教育，进一步认识清楚美帝国主义是世界人民最凶恶的敌人，美帝国主义确实是一只纸老虎；认识清楚，只有人民团结的力量，只有人民的斗争，才是取得反对美帝国主义的战争侵略政策，保卫世界和平的胜利的决定因素。而所有这些，都在最精确的意义上，证明了我国人民伟大领袖毛泽东同志的思想的英明和伟大。
