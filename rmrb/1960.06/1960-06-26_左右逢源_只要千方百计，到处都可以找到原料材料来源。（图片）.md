    Resourcefulness
    ——By every possible means, raw materials can be found everywhere.
    The electrical factory established sixteen satellite factories, using side-cut waste materials to increase the production of electrical products. This is a 96-kilowatt electric motor made from side-cut waste materials.

    Shanghai textile workers used more than seventy kinds of wild fibers to spin many different kinds of yarn and weave more than four hundred kinds of cloth.

    The Harbin Woolen Mill, while ensuring that the quality of its original products continues to improve, has successively used artificial wool, flax fiber, waste wool, etc., to make many inexpensive and high-quality woolen products. This is a scene of workers counting high-grade jacquard blankets woven with a blend of 50% artificial wool and wool, which are not only cheaper but also have better insulation properties than pure wool.
