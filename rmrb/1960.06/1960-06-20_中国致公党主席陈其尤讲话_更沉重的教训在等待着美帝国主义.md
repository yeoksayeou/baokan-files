Xinhua News Agency, 19th. Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the China Zhi Gong Party, stated at a rally of democratic parties and non-party democrats against U.S. imperialist aggression on the 18th that after U.S. imperialist ringleader Eisenhower buried the Four-Power Summit, he has now run to the western Pacific to cheer on his lackeys in Asia, strengthen the suppression of national and democratic movements of Asian peoples, and intensify war preparations and war provocations. Eisenhower even came to our territory of Taiwan, attempting to continue to promote his aggressive policy of creating "two Chinas" and completely turning Taiwan into a U.S. colony.

    He said that Eisenhower's "Far East trip" is part of the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression and war, and a continuation of his activities such as sending spy planes to the Soviet Union for military reconnaissance, war provocations, and sabotaging the Four-Power Summit.

    He said that Eisenhower's bandit trip has aroused the boundless anger of the people of the Philippines, South Korea, Japan, and other Asian countries, and waves of opposition have been set off everywhere. When this "plague god" arrived in the Philippines, he was met with angry protests from the broad masses of the Filipino people. The Japanese people's surging struggles have forced him to announce a "postponement of his visit to Japan." Eisenhower has begun to taste the lessons of the Asian people, and it can be asserted that even greater and heavier lessons await him. U.S. imperialism must get out of Asia! The Asian people's anti-U.S. patriotic and just struggle will surely rise higher and higher and will surely achieve complete and thorough victory.

    Chen Qiyou said that now this "plague god" has arrived in our territory of Taiwan. On the tenth anniversary of U.S. imperialist occupation of our territory of Taiwan, and at a time when the compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu are suffering more and more painfully from the inhuman life under the reactionary rule of the U.S. and Chiang, this "plague god" has come to Taiwan again to further create the conspiracy of "two Chinas" and intensify military provocations against our country. To this, I, like every Chinese person, feel an irrepressible anger in my heart!

    Chen Qiyou emphasized that we absolutely cannot tolerate such sinister conspiracies and provocations by U.S. imperialism and Eisenhower. We must severely deal with this "plague god." The Letter to the Military and Civilians of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu by the Fujian Front Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on June 17, 1960, and the anti-U.S. armed demonstration held on the Kinmen front fully expressed the strong will of the entire Chinese people to support the just struggle of the Asian people and patriotic compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu against Eisenhower's bandit trip, and fully expressed the Chinese people's firm confidence in liberating Taiwan and their contempt, disdain, and anger towards Eisenhower. Taiwan is China's sacred territory. We want to warn U.S. imperialism that the Chinese people will surely liberate Taiwan, and this cannot be intimidated or blocked by any reactionary force.

    Chen Qiyou concluded by saying, "I, on behalf of all members of the China Zhi Gong Party, solemnly declare: We fully support the decision of the Fujian Front Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to conduct large-scale anti-U.S. demonstration shelling. We are determined to stand together with the people of the whole country, continue to expose and resolutely oppose the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression and war, continue to accelerate our country's socialist construction and modernization of national defense, and fight to the end for the liberation of our territory of Taiwan and the defense of Asian and world peace."

    中国致公党主席陈其尤讲话
    更沉重的教训在等待着美帝国主义
    新华社19日讯　中国致公党主席陈其尤18日在各民主党派和无党派民主人士反对美帝侵略的抗议集会上说，美帝国主义头子艾森豪威尔埋葬了四国首脑会议之后，现在又跑到太平洋西边来为他在亚洲扶植的走狗打气，加强镇压亚洲各国人民的民族民主运动，加紧备战部署和战争挑衅。艾森豪威尔还来到我国领土台湾，妄图继续推行他的制造“两个中国”和把台湾完全沦为美国的殖民地的侵略政策。
    他说，艾森豪威尔这次“远东之行”是美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策的一部分，是它派遣间谍飞机对苏联进行军事侦察、战争挑衅和破坏四国首脑会议等活动的继续。
    他说，艾森豪威尔这次强盗旅行，已激起了菲律宾、南朝鲜、日本及亚洲各国人民的无比愤怒，到处都掀起了反对的浪潮。当这个“瘟神”到达菲律宾时遭到了广大菲律宾人民的愤怒抗议。日本人民一浪比一浪高涨的斗争，已逼使了他不得不宣布“推迟访日”。艾森豪威尔已开始尝到了亚洲人民的教训，可以断言，更大更沉重的教训还等待着他。美帝国主义必须从亚洲地区滚出去！亚洲人民的反美爱国正义斗争一定越来越高涨，一定会得到完全彻底的胜利。
    陈其尤说，现在这个“瘟神”已经到达我们的领土台湾来了。在美帝国主义占领我国领土台湾十周年的时候，在台、澎、金、马同胞饱受美蒋反动统治过着越来越痛苦的非人生活的时候，这个“瘟神”又到台湾来进一步制造“两个中国”的阴谋活动，加紧对我国的军事挑衅，对此，我和每一个中国人民一样心里激动着无可遏止的愤怒！
    陈其尤强调指出，美帝国主义和艾森豪威尔这种罪恶阴谋和挑衅，我们是绝对不能容忍的。我们一定要狠狠对付这个“瘟神”。中国人民解放军福建前线司令部1960年6月17日的告台、澎、金、马军民同胞书和在金门前线举行的反美武装示威完全表达了全中国人民支持亚洲各国人民和台、澎、金、马爱国同胞反对艾森豪威尔强盗旅行的正义斗争的坚强意志，完全表达了中国人民一定解放台湾的坚定信心和对艾森豪威尔的蔑视、鄙视和愤怒。台湾是中国神圣的领土。我们要警告美帝国主义，中国人民一定要解放台湾，这是任何反动力量所吓唬不了和阻挡不了的。
    陈其尤最后说，我谨代表中国致公党全体成员严正声明：我们完全拥护中国人民解放军福建前线司令部进行反美大示威炮击的决定。我们坚决和全国人民一起，继续揭露和坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，继续加速我国社会主义建设和现代化国防建设，为解放我国领土台湾，保卫亚洲和世界和平而斗争到底。
