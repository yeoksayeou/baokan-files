    Supporting the Wheat Harvest
    Fu Zhanyuan, Worker at Zhengzhou Thermal Power Plant
    The moon is clear and bright,
    Shining on the wheat fields,
    Wheat stalks golden yellow,
    Gentle breeze rolls the fine waves.
    Holding a sharp sickle,
    The sickle flashes silver light,
    Wheat stalks rustle,
    Wheat falls row by row.
    Competing to see who reaps the fastest,
    Competing to see who has the most strength,
    A flurry of figures,
    All in workers' attire...
    Comrade sisters of the commune,
    Bring tea to our side:
    "Worker brothers,
    Cool water to moisten your throats"...
    A bowl of plain boiled water,
    How can friendship be measured?
    Surpasses red rose wine,
    Stronger than sweet sugar...
    Drinking it all in one gulp,
    Bowl bottom facing the sky,
    Reaping until the crowing of dawn,
    Faces flushed with rosy light...

    支援麦收
    郑州热电厂工人　傅占元
    月儿清又亮，
    照在麦地上，
    麦棵黄澄澄，
    微风卷细浪。
    手握快镰刀，
    镰刀闪银光，
    麦梗沙沙响，
    麦倒一行行。
    比谁割的快，
    比谁有力量，
    一片人影动，
    全是工人装……
    公社姐妹们，
    端茶到身旁：
    “工人大哥呵，
    淡水润润嗓”……
    一碗白开水，
    友谊怎么量？
    胜过红玫酒，
    强似甜蜜糖……
    一口喝个尽，
    碗底朝天上，
    割到晨乌啼，
    满脸红霞光……
