Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, June 13th. Hebei Province's transportation departments are carrying out a high-transportation, high-output safeguarding movement to ensure a substantial increase in production at key industrial and mining enterprises such as the Tangshan Steel Plant, Pangjiabao Iron Mine, and Jingxing Coal Mine. Since the beginning of June, key enterprises like Tangshan Steel Plant, Pangjiabao Iron Mine, and Jingxing Coal Mine have been overfulfilling their loading plans daily. On June 5th, the province's railway departments loaded more than 700 cars over the plan, setting a new record for daily car loading in Hebei Province.

In this movement, Hebei Province's transportation departments, based on the principle of ensuring key points and taking care of general needs, have strengthened leadership in key areas and key stations. Under the unified leadership of Party committees at all levels, the transportation departments in these key areas have jointly organized collaboration offices and transportation command centers with key factories and mines, with station masters and factory/mine Party secretaries or factory/mine directors personally taking charge, working on the transportation site, unifying station and factory (mine) plans, strengthening dispatching, and organizing rush loading and unloading work.

During the movement, the transportation departments also fully tapped the potential of existing transportation tools, fixed the vehicles running between key stations and key factories and mines according to production needs, and fixed sections, running times, and loading and unloading times. They also formulated a dedicated line direct entry and exit car pick-up operation method, which improved transportation efficiency.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, June 13th. The broad masses of workers on the transportation front in Henan Province have launched a high tide of rushing to transport materials needed for increased steel production. In May, the railway system's transport volume of coal, coke, ore, pig iron, etc., increased by 9.5% compared to April. The average daily transport volume for the first seven days of June increased by another 4.1% compared to May. The increase in transport volume by road and inland river was even greater.

In order to ensure a substantial increase in steel production, at the beginning of May, the Henan Provincial Transportation Authority and the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau organized a transportation battle centered on rushing to transport coal. Transportation joint offices with representatives from railway, transportation, coal, metallurgy, and other relevant departments were established from the province to the county level. They inspected and handled problems that occurred during transportation every day, and supervised production departments to tap production potential and transportation departments to exert transportation efficiency, which played a great role in promoting production and transportation. During the high tide of rushing transportation, various regions organized a large number of cadres to go deep into the transportation key points to specifically lead this work. Many regions also mobilized and organized the transportation tools of enterprises, agencies, and people's communes to participate in transportation, overcoming the difficulty of insufficient vehicles.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, June 13th. Since the beginning of June, Shanxi Province has dispatched 190,000 transportation troops and 75,000 vehicles of various types to rush transport steel, ore, raw coal, and coking coal to ensure high production at key steel, iron, and coal enterprises. In the first ten days of June, steel transport volume increased by 13% compared to the same period in May; coking coal increased by 14.2%, and raw coal transport volume also increased.

At the beginning of June, the employees of the Shanxi Provincial Transportation System, in coordination with the second-quarter production competition exceeding the first quarter launched by employees of steel, coal, and mining enterprises throughout the province, launched a movement of "transporting as soon as it is produced, not letting steel, coal, and ore touch the ground." Taiyuan City dispatched 800 trucks to rush transport pig iron, ore, limestone, and coke, and took measures at six transportation stations throughout the city to reduce the phenomenon of vehicles returning empty.

In order to ensure that half of the province's cars reached "ten thousand ton-kilometers" in June, a total of 60,000 people were dispatched throughout the province to repair roads. Taiyuan City has recently widened seven highway trunk lines and repaired forty bridges. The employees of the Shanxi Automobile Manufacturing Plant and the machinery plants in various cities and counties are also rushing to repair cars for the transportation departments. Taiyuan City has recently repaired 200 cars and put them into transportation. Automobile stations throughout the province are also vigorously carrying out technological innovation in loading and unloading.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, June 13th. The employees of the transportation front in Jilin Province launched a mass movement to "seize high transport and ensure high production," which promoted the steady increase of freight volume. In early June, the province's average daily coal transport volume increased by 0.44% compared to May, coke daily transport volume increased by 24%, and ore daily transport volume increased by 16%. To date, 40% of the province's cities and counties and one-third of the railway stations have completed half of their annual transport plans.

The large-scale "seize high transport, ensure high production" movement was launched under the direct leadership of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. In mid-May, the Provincial Party Committee's Transportation Work Department convened a conference of transportation work ministers from various regions, and made a combat deployment of "using one-dragon transportation to ensure high transport, using high transport to ensure high production, reducing operating time by half, and doubling transportation efficiency." Subsequently, leading cadres at all levels went to the front line to specifically command this movement. Zhao Lin, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Yan Zitao, Minister of the Transportation Work Department, and Wu Ying, Deputy Minister, went deep into the Tonghua, Baicheng, and Siping regions to inspect and direct the transportation of steel, coal, ore, etc. The various railway bureaus and offices organized inspection teams and leading groups headed by the Party Committee Secretary to widely mobilize the masses at lines and stations, explain the situation, assign tasks, propose measures, grasp key points, and encourage the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of employees.

People's Daily, Hefei, June 13th. The transportation departments of Anhui Province actively organized one-dragon transportation and large-scale collaboration, loading more and transporting faster the "two coals" (coal, coke) and "four stones" (iron ore, limestone, dolomite, kyanite), vigorously supporting steel production inside and outside the province. In May, the province's ore and coal transport volume rose sharply, with the completed ore and coal transport volume increasing by more than 68,000 tons compared to April. From June 1st to 5th, the province completed a total of 226,000 tons of ore and coal transport volume, an increase of more than 16,000 tons compared to the same period in May.

At present, the province has organized 20 cross-provincial one-dragon transportation lines, 36 cross-special zone one-dragon transportation lines, and 86 one-dragon transportation lines for short-distance transportation within special zones and loading and unloading and handling in urban areas. These transportation lines closely connect long and short distances, water and land routes, branch and trunk lines, and transportation inside and outside factories, forming a transportation line connected in a straight line, greatly accelerating the turnover of vehicles and ships and shortening transportation time. The time for transporting coal from Huainan to Shanghai has been shortened from four to six days to fifty hours each time since the organization of one-dragon transportation and large-scale collaboration.

Party committees at all levels in Anhui, from the province to the special cities, have strengthened their leadership over this work and personally directed it on the spot. In addition to regularly going to the Wannan mines and other places to supervise and inspect, the Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, the Commander of the Provincial Transportation Command, and responsible comrades from relevant departments and bureaus have some responsible comrades residing in the mining area to take charge and help solve specific transportation problems, which has effectively strengthened this work.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, June 13th. The employees on the transportation front in Zhejiang Province saw a 13% increase in freight volume in the first five days of June compared to the same period last month.

In order to ensure the transportation of various materials required for steel production, 15 units including Hangzhou Railway Bureau, Jiaxing District Shipping Company, Banshan Steel Plant, and relevant iron mines broke the boundaries of factories, mines, roads, and ports to conduct comprehensive large-scale collaboration in production, supply, transportation, and sales. According to the flow of materials, they formed several water and land one-dragon transportation lines, with fixed points, fixed lines, and fixed shifts for transportation, greatly accelerating the transportation efficiency of coal, coke, and ore and ensuring the supply of raw materials and fuel for steel production.

Under the unified leadership of Party committees at all levels, the transportation departments and factory and mining enterprises in various places also rushed to repair narrow-gauge railways and roads leading to mines and coal wells to ensure the smooth flow of coal, iron, and ore transportation.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining, June 13th. The highway transportation department of Qinghai Province organized professional motor vehicle teams and adopted the "one-dragon" transportation method to transport ore and coke, ensuring a substantial increase in steel production. In the first ten days of June, the province's iron production increased by 42% compared to late May, and steel production increased by nearly two times.

In order to provide sufficient "grain" for "small indigenous groups" steel enterprises, the Qinghai Highway Transportation Department transferred 13% of the province's professional operating vehicles in May this year to form a transportation team dedicated to transporting coke and ore for steel smelting enterprises. This professional motor vehicle team launched a red flag competition of "safety, economy, and ten thousand ton-kilometers per ton per month," and implemented a "four-fix" transportation method of fixed routes, fixed tasks, fixed times, and fixed factories, ensuring the supply of raw materials for various smelting plants in the Xining area.

At the same time, the Xining Transportation "One-Dragon" Joint Office also specially organized the "one-dragon" transportation of coke, which not only tapped transportation potential and simplified procedures, but also effectively ensured the timely supply of raw materials required by the smelting plants.
