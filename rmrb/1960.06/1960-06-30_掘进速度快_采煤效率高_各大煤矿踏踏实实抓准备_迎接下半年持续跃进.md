Fast Tunneling Speed, High Coal Mining Efficiency
Major Coal Mines Solidly Prepare to Welcome Continued Leaps Forward in the Second Half of the Year

Kailuan Grasps Coal Mining and Tunneling Simultaneously, Preparing Five Months of Extractable Coal
Kailuan

(Our newspaper, Tianjin, 29th dispatch) The more than 60,000 employees of Kailuan Coal Mine, while vigorously grasping the large-scale increase in raw coal production in June, are also vigorously strengthening tunneling and safety work, and actively preparing for production in the third quarter. By mid-June, the mine's extractable coal volume had reached more than five months, and more than ten spare mining faces had been prepared.

In order to achieve a sustained leap forward in the third quarter, a meeting of leading cadres at all levels was held in the mining area in early June to inspect and deploy production preparation work. The party committee secretaries of each mine took personal command, established high-speed tunneling leading groups and command headquarters, and adopted various measures to greatly accelerate the progress of exploration and tunneling projects. The entire mining area also transferred 950 laborers to enrich the tunneling teams. At the same time, the leaders of each mine also summarized and promoted the advanced experiences in rapid tunneling created by the masses in the first half of the year, such as slotting and blasting, loading and transporting, support, and road repair. This played a great role in ensuring the acceleration of tunneling speed. From June 1st to 20th, the average daily tunneling footage in the entire mining area increased by 210 meters compared to May.

Transferring Labor Saved by Technological Innovation into Tunneling Teams
Jingxi

(Our newspaper dispatch) The broad masses of workers and staff of the Jingxi Mining Bureau are striving to produce more raw coal for the country in June, while vigorously strengthening tunneling and preparing more coal mining work surfaces, in order to create conditions for a greater leap forward in the third quarter.

Entering June, the mines affiliated with the bureau successively held skill competitions. While the Party Committee mobilized the broad masses of workers and staff to launch a coal-grabbing campaign, turning June into a month of large-scale high production, a mass movement of a "rapid tunneling month" was launched throughout the bureau. The average daily footage from June 1st to 22nd increased by 6% compared to the same period in May. Various mines universally adjusted labor organization, and promptly formed new tunneling teams with the manpower saved in the technological revolution. At present, the number of tunneling teams in the bureau has increased from 97 to 111.

Vigorously Grasping Tunneling and Stripping for a Good Start to the Third Quarter
Hegang

(Our newspaper, Harbin, 29th dispatch) Hegang Coal Mine in Heilongjiang Province is actively preparing for a good start to production in the third quarter.

In order to strengthen stripping work, Hegang Dongshan Open-Pit Mine recently transferred more than 2,500 people to participate in stripping. At the same time, a new technology of hydraulic soil stripping was also adopted, increasing the daily stripping volume from 2,000 cubic meters to more than 3,000 cubic meters. The various mine shafts have also strengthened the strength of tunneling work, and designated mine directors and well directors to specially grasp this work. As a result of strengthening tunneling work, the tunneling volume in the first twenty days of June increased by more than 2,340 meters compared to the same period in May, creating good conditions for a good start in July.

Timely Adjustment of Labor Organization to Accelerate Tunneling Speed
Huainan

(Our newspaper, Hefei, 29th dispatch) Huainan Coal Mine is solidifying preparations for production in the third quarter, so that more than 20 new coal mining work surfaces have been prepared ahead of schedule in June. Huainan Coal Mine's planned output in the second half of the year will increase by about 20% compared to the first half of the year. In response to this new situation, the Party Committee Secretary or Mine Director of each mine is responsible for production preparation work, and measures such as adjusting labor organization to strengthen tunneling forces are taken to accelerate preparation work. In order to adapt to the comprehensive promotion of the inclined coal seam shielding support coal mining method in the third quarter, Xin Zhuangzi Mine organized four tunneling teams and six tunneling groups to specially attack the development work of the new mining area for shielding support. As a result, in the first half of June, the tunneling footage was overfulfilled by more than 200 meters, and a extractable coal volume of more than six months was prepared. Jiulonggang Mine transferred more than 360 workers to organize four tunneling teams to accelerate the development of the new mining area, thus ensuring that the tunneling task for the first half of the year was completed more than a month ahead of schedule, and an extractable coal volume of more than three months was obtained.

Striving to Increase Tunneling Speed by 77%
Hebi

(Our newspaper, Zhengzhou, 29th dispatch) In order to strive for a greater leap forward in raw coal production in July and the third quarter, Hebi Coal Mine in Henan Province has achieved remarkable results in vigorously grasping tunneling while making preparations for the next step of production.

According to the third quarter plan requirements of the Hebi Mining Bureau, the entire bureau must have 15 spare work surfaces, and the extractable period for coal volume must reach more than six months. To this end, the average monthly progress of tunneling work surfaces must be increased by more than 77% on the basis of the existing one.

In order to adapt to the needs of a substantial increase, the Hebi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China first vigorously grasped the promotion of advanced experience. The mines throughout the city universally launched a competition craze of "learning from tunneling pacesetter Qi Hezhi and surpassing Qi Hezhi"; at the same time, the rapid tunneling experience of the Qi Hezhi tunneling team was comprehensively promoted.

Prepared Five and a Half Months of Mining Work Surfaces
Pingxiang

(Our newspaper, Nanchang, 29th dispatch) The Party Committees of the various mines under the Pingxiang Mining Bureau in Jiangxi Province grasped both the large-scale high production in June and the preparation work for the third quarter. While coal production rose steadily, the total tunneling footage soared. Up to now, the tunneling work of the entire bureau has prepared mining work surfaces for the next five and a half months of coal production. (Attached picture)

The Ren Guangjin Sanhong Youth Tunneling Team of Kailuan Coal Mine in Hebei Province adopted the operating method of simultaneously operating with double electric drills and nine-meter-long drills, which greatly increased the tunneling progress, with a maximum daily footage of more than 90 meters.
