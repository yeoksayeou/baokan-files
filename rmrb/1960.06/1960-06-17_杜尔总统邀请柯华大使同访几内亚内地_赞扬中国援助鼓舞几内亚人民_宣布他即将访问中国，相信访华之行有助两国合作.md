In his speech at the rally, President Sékou Touré praised the people of socialist countries for their commitment to defending world peace and the cause of human progress.

He said that China's assistance to Guinea's economic development and the defense of its national independence has encouraged the people of Guinea and the people of Africa. He also said that when imperialism, especially French imperialism, undermined Guinea's three-year economic plan, and when Guinea encountered difficulties, the Chinese people unconditionally donated 15,000 tons of rice to Guinea. In addition, when the imperialists carried out subversive activities against independent Guinea, and when they prevented Africa from moving towards liberation and independence, 650 million Chinese people declared that they stood with the people of all African countries and the people of Guinea.

President Sékou Touré said that he will visit China soon, and he believes that this visit will further strengthen the friendly cooperation between our two countries.

    新华社科纳克里15日电　中国驻几内亚大使柯华应几内亚总统塞古·杜尔的邀请，同他一起访问了几内亚内地。他们在几内亚国民议会议长迪阿洛·塞福拉耶、内政部长卡马拉·达曼坦和宣传部长阿兰桑·迪奥普的陪同下，在13日至15日访问了几内亚的维多利亚、博克和博法。在访问途中，曾经有好几千居民举行了一次盛大集会欢迎中国大使和几内亚政府领导人。
    塞古·杜尔总统在这次集会上讲话时，赞扬社会主义国家人民致力于保卫世界和平，致力于人类的进步事业。
    他说，中国对几内亚的经济发展和保卫祖国独立所提供的援助鼓舞了几内亚人民和非洲人民。他又说，当帝国主义特别是法帝国主义破坏几内亚的三年经济计划，当几内亚遇到困难的时候，中国人民向几内亚无条件地赠送了一万五千吨大米。此外，当各帝国主义对独立的几内亚进行颠覆活动时，当它们阻止非洲走向解放和独立时，六亿五千万中国人民宣布同非洲各国人民和几内亚人民站在一边。
    塞古·杜尔总统说，我不久将去中国访问，我相信，这次访问将进一步加强我们两国之间的友好合作。
