To Ensure the Comprehensive and Timely Completion of Summer Harvest and Planting
Xinle Formulates Ten Measures to Tap Labor Potential

(Reported by this newspaper) After fighting drought, the 360,000 mu of wheat and 70,000 mu of early-maturing crops in Xinle County, Hebei, are growing well and will soon mature. In mid-May, the county party committee conducted specific research on the summer harvest and planting to achieve a bumper harvest. According to past experience, harvesting summer crops requires about fifteen days, consuming 430,000 labor days; summer planting tasks require 220,000 labor days, plus watering of field crops, management of autumn seedlings, pest control, etc., totaling 1,650,000 labor days. However, at that time, the county could only mobilize 95,000 male and female full and half laborers each day, generating 70,000 labor days. In fifteen days, only 1,050,000 labor days could be completed, leaving a shortage of 600,000 labor days. This calculation sounded an alarm about whether they could complete the summer harvest and planting on time.

To solve this problem, the county party committee promptly convened a symposium to study specific solutions. At the beginning of the symposium, most people advocated increasing labor efficiency through large-scale tool reform and launching labor competitions. Some people also harbored feelings of difficulty and believed that this year's summer harvest and planting could not be completed on time. After summarizing and discussing, the latter view was criticized, and ten solutions were summarized for labor arrangement. These ten measures are:

Clever: Arrange cleverly in sections and stages, advancing various farm tasks. Water all spring-sown crops before wheat harvest, hoe cotton twice, and set seedlings; thin millet and corn seedlings completely. In addition, classify and rank all labor forces once, form specialized teams for harvesting, transportation, threshing, and autumn field management according to commune members' expertise and production needs, so that everyone can use their talents to the fullest.

Dig: Dig deep into labor potential. Vigorously promote the mechanization of rice and flour processing to reduce the use of humans and animals for pushing mills; unearth auxiliary labor forces that do not work regularly and implement reasonable work point recording and payment to mobilize their production enthusiasm; reduce and postpone the sideline occupations of production teams.

Aid: With the commune as the unit, mobilize production teams with less wheat fields to support production teams with more wheat fields based on the principle of equivalent exchange.

Fix: During the summer harvest and planting, promote the "Seven Fixes" (fix labor force, fix draught animals, fix farm tools, fix tasks, fix time, fix remuneration, fix dedicated leadership); the "Three Alignments" (livestock and farm tools are aligned, labor force and farm work are aligned, contract quantity and quality acceptance are aligned) fixed responsibility system.

Block: Block labor loopholes. During the summer harvest, basic-level cadre meetings are not allowed to be held without the approval of the county party committee; production teams are not allowed to hold mass meetings without the approval of the commune; all industries and trades are only allowed to support agricultural production during the summer harvest period and are not allowed to transfer labor from rural areas. Do a good job in people's lives, ensuring work and rest, so that commune members have ample energy to carry out the summer harvest and planting.

Reform: Reform harvesting and threshing tools. Change hand-pulling to sickle harvesting, reform and manufacture some indigenous harvesters and threshers; change threshing at the edge of the village to threshing in the field; change finding tools at the last minute to having everything ready.

Rush: The militia and the Communist Youth League form shock brigades for rushing harvest and planting, and young and middle-aged people, the elderly, children, and other auxiliary labor forces form specialized shock brigades and groups for threshing, gleaning wheat, watering, hoeing, pest control, and errands, organize battles in sections and by task, and conduct shock work.

Yield: In terms of leadership, deploy forces to strengthen the leadership of the summer harvest and planting. The tasks of industry, finance and trade, culture, and education on all fronts must yield to agriculture during the summer harvest and planting; the transportation department must speed up before the summer harvest to accelerate the transportation of goods.

Contract: In the summer harvest and planting work, implement contracting to the end for the six major processes (harvesting, transporting, threshing, watering, plowing, planting), and fully implement them to the work groups. Remuneration is based on quotas, and rewards are given for those who exceed the task, encouraging commune members' enthusiasm for production.

Compete: Launch a competition of "One Exceeds" (labor exceeds quota), "Two Mores" (more people attend work, more cadres participate in production), and "Three Highs" (high labor efficiency, high quality of farm work, high morale of commune members) between communes, districts, teams, and groups.

After the initial implementation of these ten measures, the production enthusiasm of the commune members has been further mobilized. To prepare water for summer planting, as of May 21, all eight communes in the county had expanded the original 7.5 flow rate of canal water to 14 flow rates through water conservancy projects such as blocking ponds, digging potential flows, and digging wells. From May 21 to 28, the county launched the second shock week of watering, thinning seedlings, pest control, and large-scale autumn sowing, and reformed and manufactured more than 40 types of small and medium-sized tools for harvesting and threshing, totaling 70,000 pieces.

### 保证夏收夏种全面适时完成  新乐制订十项办法挖掘劳动潜力

    保证夏收夏种全面适时完成
    新乐制订十项办法挖掘劳动潜力
    本报讯　河北新乐县的三十六万亩小麦和七万亩早熟作物，经过抗旱斗争，生长良好，即将成熟。为作到丰产丰收，在5月中旬县委对夏收夏种进行了具体研究。根据以往经验：收割夏收作物需用十五天左右的时间，四十三万个劳动日；夏种任务需用二十二万个劳动日，加上大田作物浇水、秋苗管理、除虫等共需用劳动日一百六十五万个。但是全县当时每天只能出动九万五千个男女整半劳力，作七万个劳动日。十五天仅能作一百零五万个劳动日，尚缺六十万个劳动日。这一算账，给他们能否适时完成夏收夏种敲响了警钟。
    为解决这一问题，县委及时召开座谈会，研究解决具体的措施。开始座谈时，大部分人主张通过大搞工具改革，开展劳动竞赛，提高劳动效率。也有些人存有畏难情绪，认为今年的夏收夏种不能按时完成。经过总结和座谈，批判了后一种观点，在劳力安排上，归纳成十条解决办法。这十项办法是：
    巧：分节分段巧安排，各项农活往前赶。麦收前春播作物普浇一水，棉花普锄两遍，定好苗；谷子、玉米间完苗。此外，对所有劳力进行一次分类排队，按社员专长和生产需要组成收割、运输、打场、秋田管理等专业队，作到量才使用，人尽其才。
    挖：大挖劳动潜力。大搞米面加工机械化，减少推碾用的人畜；挖出过去不经常出工的辅助劳力，对他们实行合理记工付酬，调动他们的生产积极性；减缩和缓办生产队的副业。
    援：以公社为单位，根据等价交换的原则，发动麦田少的生产队支援麦田多的生产队。
    定：在夏收夏种中，推行“七定”（定劳力、定耕畜、定农具、定任务、定时间、定报酬、定专人领导）；“三对口”（牲口、农具配套对口，劳力农活配套对口，包工数量和质量验收对口）的固定责任制。
    堵：堵塞劳力漏洞。在夏收期间，不经县委批准，不准召开基层干部会议；生产队不经公社批准不许召开群众大会；各行各业在夏收期间只许支援农业生产，不许抽调农村的劳力。搞好人民生活，保证有劳有逸，使社员有充沛的精力进行夏收夏种。
    改：改制收割打场工具。改手拔为镰割，改制一部分土造收割机、脱粒机；改村边打场为地头打场；改事到临头找工具为一切齐备。
    突：由民兵和共青团组成抢收抢种突击队，壮年、老年、儿童及其他辅助劳力组成打场、拾麦、浇水、锄地、除虫、使役等专业突击队、组，分段、分事组织战役，进行突击。
    让：在领导力量上，要调兵遣将，加强夏收夏种的领导，工业、财贸、文教各个战线的任务，在夏收夏种期间要给农业让路；交通运输部门在夏收前快马加鞭，加快货物运输。
    包：在夏收夏种工作中，对六大工序（收、运、打、浇、耕、种）实行一包到底，全部落实到作业小组。按定额取酬，对超额完成任务的要给以奖励，鼓舞社员生产积极性。
    赛：社与社、区与区、队与队、组与组之间开展一超（劳动超定额）、二多（出勤的人多，干部参加生产的多）、三高（劳动效率高，农活质量高，社员情绪高）的竞赛。
    这十项办法初步实行以后，进一步调动了社员的生产积极性。为给夏播准备用水，截至到5月21日，全县八个公社通过挡汪、挖潜流、打井等水利建设，由原有七点五个流量的渠水，扩大到十四个流量。全县自5月21日到28日，掀起第二个浇水、间苗、除虫、大秋播种突击周，并改制收割、打场用的小中型工具四十多种共七万件。
