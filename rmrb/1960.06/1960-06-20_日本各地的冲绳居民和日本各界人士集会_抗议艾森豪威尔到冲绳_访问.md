Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 19th: Approximately 1,500 representatives of Okinawa residents living in mainland Japan and people from all walks of life in Japan held a rally in Tokyo today to protest Eisenhower's "visit" to Okinawa. The conference adopted a resolution demanding that the United States immediately return Okinawa to Japan and abolish the US nuclear weapons base in Okinawa.

The resolution pointed out that Okinawa Island, originally part of Japanese territory, and its residents are still under US rule, which violates the United Nations Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and democratic principles.

The resolution demanded the removal of restrictions hindering free movement between the people of Okinawa and the people of mainland Japan.

The conference also passed a resolution requesting the Japanese government and the Diet to negotiate with the United States on the issue of recovering Okinawa. The conference announced the formal establishment of the "All-Japan Okinawa Residents Association" today.

    日本各地的冲绳居民和日本各界人士集会
    抗议艾森豪威尔到冲绳“访问”
    据新华社19日讯　东京消息：住在日本内地的冲绳人的代表和日本各界人士共约一千五百人今天在东京举行大会，抗议艾森豪威尔到冲绳“访问”。大会通过决议，要求美国立即把冲绳归还日本，撤销美国在冲绳的核武器基地。
    决议指出，本来是日本领土一部分的冲绳岛和冲绳居民现在仍然处在美国统治之下，这种情况是违反联合国宪章、世界人权宣言和民主原则的。
    决议要求撤销阻碍冲绳人民和日本内地人民自由往来的限制。
    大会还通过一项决议，要求日本政府和国会就收回冲绳问题同美国进行谈判。大会宣布今天正式成立了“日本全国冲绳居民会”。
