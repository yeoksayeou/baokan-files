Xinhua News Agency, 8th. The International Minister of the All-Indonesia Central Trade Union Federation, A. Achdiat, spoke at the World Federation of Trade Unions Council meeting on the morning of the 8th.

He said that we are very interested in the reports made by Comrades Bula and Zakaria, which are the basic materials for discussion at this meeting. What caught our attention was that this report compared the living standards of imperialist-capitalist countries with those of socialist countries. We can draw the conclusion that only socialism can liberate the working class and other working people from poverty and political oppression. Although the level of industrial development in the United States and other imperialist countries is very high, this industrial development serves capitalism and imperialism, and it cannot eliminate poverty and unemployment.

He said that we believe it is important that, in addition to leading workers in their daily struggle to improve their social, economic and democratic rights, we should continue to raise the political awareness of the working masses in the spirit of socialism.

What I want to say is that we should not hide from the working masses the fact that only socialism, not capitalism, can liberate the working class from economic and political oppression. Imperialism cannot help the working class and people in colonial and semi-colonial countries.

Resolutely Oppose Imperialist "Economic Aid"

Achdiat then exposed the essence of imperialist "economic aid." He said that regarding the issue of so-called "economic aid," we would like to state here that the Indonesian people are resolutely opposed to imperialist "economic aid."

For more than three hundred and fifty years, Dutch imperialism did not provide assistance for the development of the Indonesian national economy; on the contrary, it plundered the economic wealth of the Indonesian people. Indeed, Dutch imperialism extracted hundreds of millions in profits, while the Indonesian people remained impoverished. The so-called "economic aid" provided through the U.S. Export-Import Bank has not brought benefits to the Indonesian people, but has instead caused new economic difficulties.

Based on the above experience, Indonesian workers have no illusions about imperialist aid.

On the contrary, Indonesian workers are currently fighting to completely eliminate Dutch economic forces, stop the expansion of foreign investment, and gradually eliminate the economic forces of American imperialism.

Achdiat said that some may want to ask what attitude we take toward economic assistance from socialist countries.

Comrades, for many years, with the support of people who oppose imperialism, Indonesian workers have waged a resolute struggle to open up and develop economic cooperation between Indonesia and socialist countries.

Demanding and striving to establish financial and economic ties with socialist countries is not an easy struggle. We must first oppose the pro-imperialist, reactionary groups in power. Only when we drive the comprador elements out of the government can we open the road to establishing economic relations and cooperation with socialist countries, which are currently expanding day by day.

Obviously, we not only do not reject economic assistance from socialist countries, but on the contrary, we are striving for it. Promoting economic, cultural, and political relations with socialist countries is very important for strengthening our people's struggle against imperialism.

He said that it can be clearly seen that if the following two conditions are met, then the economic assistance from socialist countries will be effective. These two conditions are: first, isolate the comprador groups in the government; second, maximize the benefits of this assistance to the people as much as possible.

He emphatically pointed out that the main problems and tasks of the Indonesian working class and people, and the line of struggle that guides our daily activities, is to completely fulfill the August Revolution of 1945. Our current task is to oppose imperialism and the remnants of feudalism, thoroughly eliminate the remnants of Dutch colonialism, oppose the increasingly rampant forces of American imperialism, and strive to establish a cabinet of mutual assistance and cooperation. We warmly welcome any assistance that can strengthen the struggle against imperialism.

More Courageously Oppose U.S. Imperialism, Don't Be Intimidated By It

Achdiat emphasized that it can be clearly seen from the two reports of the Executive Committee that the working class all over the world is facing a common enemy, which is imperialism headed by U.S. imperialism. The Indonesian people believe that American imperialism is the most dangerous enemy. But our experience shows that its power is not unlimited. If the people unite and wage a resolute struggle, it will retreat. Indonesia is now demanding the death penalty for the American pilot Pope, who was sent by U.S. imperialism to assist counter-revolutionary rebels and was shot down by us. Our struggle against the United States' attempt to send American troops to Pekanbaru under the pretext of protecting its citizens during the rebellion in Indonesia has been victorious. This was blatant and shameless interference, which aroused the anger of all the people. American imperialism did not dare to continue to insist on sending troops to Indonesia, not because it was kind-hearted, but because of the international balance of power and the unity and strength of domestic anti-imperialist forces. We should work harder to expose the false peace of imperialism, headed by the United States, while actually preparing for aggression everywhere.

Eisenhower, on the one hand, prepared to go to Paris, and on the other hand, ordered U-2 spy planes to invade Soviet airspace. At present, imperialists are gathering in Washington to plot new subversive activities in Southeast Asian countries and to send military forces and armed forces to Southeast Asian Treaty Organization member states.

He said that in the face of imperialism's clearly aggressive activities, the working class all over the world should work harder to strengthen their international solidarity and more fiercely oppose the imperialists, first and foremost the American imperialists. We should be more courageous and not be intimidated. We should take stronger international support actions to deal with all aggressions carried out by the imperialists anywhere. We have, are, and will continue to support the heroic struggle of the Japanese people against the Japan-U.S. military treaty. We should expand the struggle to abolish American and other imperialist atomic bases on other people's territories.

Achdiat said that indeed, the current forces opposing imperialism are more dominant than the forces of imperialism. The current military activities of imperialism do not show its strength, but on the contrary, show its weakness.

Our current basic task is to concentrate all our strength to smash the forces of war and aggression headed by U.S. imperialism. This is correct.

We should educate the workers not to be afraid, but to dare to oppose the imperialists, especially not to tremble before U.S. imperialism. The struggles that the people of South Korea, Japan, and other countries have carried out and are carrying out clearly prove that U.S. imperialism can be repelled. We should be vigilant against the sweet words of imperialism, because as Comrade Bula said, imperialism is the source of war. In short, we should be strong in the face of imperialism and constantly strengthen our own strength. Only with greater strength will the working class and people all over the world be able to stop and defeat the aggression of the imperialists. Only in this way can peace be guaranteed.

He said that he believes that the working class in imperialist countries will give a heavier blow to the imperialist rule in their own countries. This will mean stronger support for the struggle for national independence and democracy.

Should Support the People of All Countries Who Are Opposing Imperialist Aggression

Achdiat said, I would like to explain once again that we all love peace. But it is wrong if we allow Dutch imperialism to continue to control West Irian, the legitimate territory of the government of the Republic of Indonesia. It would be a betrayal of our national revolution if we do not drive Dutch imperialism out of West Irian and recover West Irian so that it can return to the embrace of the Republic of Indonesia. It is also wrong if we do not support the Algerian people's war against imperialism for national independence. Our active support will enhance the spirit of the Algerian people and strengthen their fighting power. And only in this way can we force the French imperialists to retreat. We believe that none of the comrades participating in this meeting hope to reduce the military equipment of the Algerian people. Of course not! On the contrary, we should provide more concrete support to the Algerian people and the people of other countries who are fiercely opposing the aggression of the imperialists.

He said that we do not beg the imperialists for peace. The imperialists will not retreat voluntarily; they must be forced to retreat.

He said, comrades, we are peace-loving people, so we must crush imperialism, which is the source of war.

In terms of unity, the most important issue is how the working class can unite politically, both domestically and internationally, first and foremost on the issue of dealing with imperialism. We should focus on political unity. Establishing organizational unity, especially international unity, still seems difficult. In order to strengthen unity, we should strengthen united action. Our experience proves that through united action, this unity will be broader and more consolidated.

Achdiat pointed out that we should resolutely oppose the divisive activities carried out by the imperialists through their lackeys.

He emphasized that on this issue, the Tito clique should be resolutely exposed, because they spread divisive poison and attempt to paralyze the struggle of the working class and people of all countries to crush imperialism, colonialism, and strive for lasting peace.

United action against imperialism will strengthen the solidarity of workers at home and abroad. Therefore, united action must be developed.

He said that he agrees with all activities to strengthen unity, but it should be based on the program that is currently of most concern to all workers around the world, that is, opposing imperialism, striving for national independence, democracy, and lasting peace. He said that based on the above situation, therefore, we Indonesian workers express our full support for the disarmament proposal recently put forward by the Soviet government.

### 敢于反对帝国主义才能保障世界和平

    全印度尼西亚中央职工会国际部长阿哈迪亚特发言强调
    敢于反对帝国主义才能保障世界和平
    必须支持一切反帝斗争必须粉碎战争根源的帝国主义
    帝国主义不会帮助被压迫人民　对帝国主义援助不要存幻想
    新华社8日讯　全印度尼西亚中央职工会国际部长阿哈迪亚特8日上午在世界工联理事会会议上发言。
    他说，我们对布拉同志和扎卡里亚同志所作的报告十分感兴趣，这个报告是这次会议讨论的基本材料。引起我们注意的是，这个报告对比了帝国主义—资本主义国家和社会主义国家的生活水平。我们可以得出这样的结论，只有社会主义才能够使工人阶级和其他劳动人民摆脱贫困和政治压迫。虽然美国和其他帝国主义国家的工业发达水平很高，但是这种工业的发展是为资本主义和帝国主义服务的，它就不能够消灭贫困和失业。
    他说，我们认为重要的是，除了领导工人争取改善社会经济和民主权利的日常斗争以外，还应该继续不断地以社会主义的精神来提高工人群众的政治觉悟。
    我想要说的是，我们不应当向工人群众掩饰这样一个事实，这就是，只有社会主义而不是资本主义才能使工人阶级摆脱经济和政治压迫。帝国主义是不能够帮助殖民地半殖民地国家的工人阶级和人民的。
    坚决反对帝国主义的“经济援助”
    阿哈迪亚特接着揭露了帝国主义“经济援助”的本质。他说，关于所谓“经济援助”的问题，我们想在这里说明，印度尼西亚人民是坚决反对帝国主义的“经济援助”的。
    荷兰帝国主义在三百五十多年间，并没有为印度尼西亚民族经济的发展给予援助，恰恰相反的，却把印度尼西亚人民的经济财富掠夺一空。的确，荷兰帝国主义榨取了数以亿计的利润，而印度尼西亚人民却依然贫困。通过美国进出口银行给予的所谓“经济援助”，并没有给印度尼西亚人民带来好处，相反地引起了新的经济困难。
    根据上述的体验，印度尼西亚工人对帝国主义的援助是没有幻想的。
    相反地，目前印度尼西亚工人正在为彻底清除荷兰的经济势力、制止外国投资的扩大和逐步肃清美国帝国主义的经济势力而进行斗争。
    阿哈迪亚特说，可能有人想问，我们对社会主义国家经济援助采取什么态度。
    同志们，好多年以来，印度尼西亚工人在反对帝国主义的人们的支持下，为了开辟和发展印度尼西亚和社会主义各国之间的经济合作，进行了坚决的斗争。
    要求和争取同社会主义国家建立财政经济的联系，这并不是轻而易举的斗争。我们首先必须反对亲帝国主义的当权的反动集团。只有当我们把买办分子从政府中赶出去以后，才能打开同社会主义国家建立经济关系和合作的道路，这种关系目前正在日益扩大。
    显然的，我们不但不拒绝社会主义国家的经济援助，相反的，我们还在争取这种援助。促进同社会主义国家在经济、文化和政治上的关系，对加强我国人民反对帝国主义的斗争是很重要的。
    他说，可以清楚地看到，如果具备了以下两个条件，那末，社会主义国家的经济援助就会取得成效。这两个条件是：第一，孤立政府中的买办集团；第二，尽可能最大限度地使这种援助有利于人民。
    他强调地指出，印度尼西亚工人阶级和人民的主要问题和任务，指导我们日常活动的斗争路线，就是彻底地完成1945年8月革命。我们目前的任务是，反对帝国主义和封建主义残余，彻底肃清荷兰殖民主义残余。反对日益猖獗的美帝国主义势力以及争取成立互助合作内阁。任何能够加强反对帝国主义斗争的援助，我们是热烈欢迎的。
    更勇敢地反对美帝国主义，不要被它吓倒
    阿哈迪亚特强调说，从执行委员会的两个报告可以清楚的看出，我们全世界的工人阶级正面对着共同的敌人，就是以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义。印度尼西亚人民认为，美国帝国主义是最危险的敌人。但是我们的经验说明，它的力量并不是无限的。如果人民团结起来并进行坚决的斗争，它就会后退。印度尼西亚现在正在要求把美国飞行员波普判处死刑，他是美帝国主义派来协助反革命叛乱分子而被我们击落的。我们反对美国在印度尼西亚发生叛乱时以保护它的公民为借口而企图派遣美国军队到北干巴鲁的斗争，已经获得胜利。这是蛮横无理和毫不羞耻的干涉，它引起了全体人民的愤怒。美国帝国主义不敢继续坚持派遣军队到印度尼西亚，这并不是因为它是好心肠，而是因为国际力量对比以及国内反对帝国主义的力量团结一致和强大的缘故。我们应该更努力地揭露以美国为首的帝国主义的假和平、而实际上准备在各地进行侵略的面目。
    艾森豪威尔一方面准备到巴黎，另一方面下令派遣U—2型间谍飞机侵犯苏联的领空。而目前帝国主义者聚集在华盛顿策划在东南亚各国进行新的颠覆活动及派遣军事力量和武装力量到东南亚条约组织成员国去。
    他说，在面对帝国主义显然是具有侵略目的的活动时，全世界的工人阶级应该更努力地加强他们的国际团结，更激烈地反对帝国主义者，首先是美帝国主义者。我们应当更加勇敢和不要被吓倒。我们应该采取更强有力的国际支援的行动来对付帝国主义者在任何地方所进行的一切侵略。我们已经、正在和将继续支持日本人民正在英勇的反对日美军事条约的斗争。我们应当扩大争取废除美国和其他帝国主义者在别人领土上的原子基地的斗争。
    阿哈迪亚特说，的确，目前反对帝国主义的力量比帝国主义的力量更加占优势。帝国主义目前的军事活动并不是说明它有力量，相反的，说明它的软弱。
    我们目前的基本任务是集中一切力量来粉碎以美国帝国主义为首的战争和侵略的力量，这是正确的。
    我们应当教育工人不要害怕，而要敢于反对帝国主义者，特别是对美国帝国主义不要颤抖。南朝鲜、日本等人民已经和正在进行的斗争，清楚地证明美国帝国主义是可以被打退的。我们应该警惕帝国主义的甜言蜜语，因为正如布拉同志所说的，帝国主义是战争的根源。总之，在面对帝国主义的时候我们应当坚强，而且不断地加强自己的力量。只有有了更加优势的力量，全世界的工人阶级和人民将能够制止和挫败帝国主义者的侵略。唯有这样，和平才能得到保障。
    他说，我相信，帝国主义国家的工人阶级将会给予本国的帝国主义的统治以更沉重的打击。这将意味着对民族独立和民主的斗争给予更强有力的支援。
    应该支援正在反对帝国主义侵略的各国人民
    阿哈迪亚特说，我想再一次地说明，我们都是热爱和平的。但是如果我们让荷兰帝国主义继续控制着印度尼西亚共和国政府的合法领土西伊里安，这是错误的。如果我们不把荷兰帝国主义从西伊里安赶出去，不收复西伊里安使之归到印度尼西亚共和国怀抱中，这就将背叛我们的民族革命。如果我们不支持阿尔及利亚人民反对帝国主义争取民族独立的战争，我们也是错误的。我们积极的支援将会增强阿尔及利亚人民的精神和加强他们的斗争力量。而且只有这样我们才能迫使法国帝国主义者后退。我们相信参加这次会议的同志们没有一个人希望减少阿尔及利亚人民的军事装备。当然不！相反的，我们应该更加具体的支援正在激烈地反对帝国主义者的侵略的阿尔及利亚人民和其他国家的人民。
    他说，我们不向帝国主义者乞求和平。帝国主义者是不会自愿后退的，必须强迫他们后退。
    他说，同志们，我们是爱好和平者，因此我们必须粉碎作为战争根源的帝国主义。
    在团结方面，最主要的问题是工人阶级在国内和国际上如何在政治观点上，首先是对待帝国主义问题上团结起来。我们应当着重政治上的团结。建立组织上的统一，尤其是国际上的统一，看来还是有困难的。为了加强团结，我们应该加强统一行动。我们的经验证明，通过统一行动，这种团结会更加广泛和巩固。
    阿哈迪亚特指出，应该坚决的反对帝国主义者通过其走狗所进行的分裂活动。
    他强调说，在这个问题上，应当坚决地揭露铁托集团，因为他们散布分裂毒素，企图瘫痪各国工人阶级和人民粉碎帝国主义、殖民主义和争取实现持久和平的斗争。
    反对帝国主义的统一行动会加强国内和国际上的工人的团结。因此，必须发展统一行动。
    他说，他同意一切为了加强团结的活动，但是应该根据目前成为全世界全体工人所最关心的问题的纲领，就是反对帝国主义、争取民族独立、民主和持久和平。他说，根据上述情况，因此我们印度尼西亚工人表示完全支持最近苏联政府提出的裁军建议。
