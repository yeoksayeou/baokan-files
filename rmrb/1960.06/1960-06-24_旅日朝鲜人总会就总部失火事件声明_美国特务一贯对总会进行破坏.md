Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 21st. The General Association of Korean Residents in Japan issued a statement on the 20th regarding the fire that destroyed the headquarters of the General Association on the 19th. The statement said that the various circumstances of the fire give sufficient reason to suspect that the fire was deliberately set.

The statement said that the fire was not accidental, occurring at a time when the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty was reaching its climax, and when the U.S. President was visiting South Korea during his Asian tour.

The statement listed examples of sabotage activities carried out by the U.S. imperialists and their special agents against the General Association and the work of repatriating Korean residents, such as attempting to blow up the Japanese Red Cross or attacking leaders of the General Association. The statement said that the fire at the headquarters of the General Association is inseparable from the above-mentioned malicious activities carried out by the reactionaries.

The statement said that the General Association will heighten its vigilance and fight against such malicious conspiracies by the enemies of peace.

    声明列举了美帝国主义者和他们的特务对总联合会和遣送朝鲜侨民工作进行破坏活动的例子，如企图炸毁日本红十字会或袭击总联合会领导人等。声明说，总联合会总部的火灾是同反动派进行的上述种种恶毒活动分不开的。
