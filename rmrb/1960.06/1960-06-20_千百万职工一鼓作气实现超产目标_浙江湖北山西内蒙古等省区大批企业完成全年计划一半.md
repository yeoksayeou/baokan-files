Xinhua News Agency, June 19th: The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company had already overfulfilled half of its annual national pig iron production plan by 14.58% on the 16th. The average daily pig iron production level of the entire company from January to May this year increased by 9.92% compared to the average daily production level in the fourth quarter of last year, the qualification rate increased by 1.55%, and the coke consumption per ton of iron smelted decreased by 86 kilograms.

After the company proposed to the national iron and steel enterprises in February this year to complete the first quarter plan ahead of schedule, the company's party committee strengthened the organization and leadership work on the front line of production and carried out a company-wide competition of iron protection and steel guarantee coordination. They firmly grasped major technical measures to seize iron and protect steel, so that in the raw materials and transportation work, the smooth production of the blast furnace was guaranteed, the pig iron production increased steadily, and the first quarter production plan was completed eight days ahead of schedule. After entering the second quarter, the company's party committee focused on technical innovation and technical revolution and organized relevant units to carry out the task of improving blast furnace raw materials, strengthening casting machines, and improving coke production, which prepared the material conditions for exceeding the first quarter in the second quarter.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, June 18th: The Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company had completed 52.9% of its annual pig iron production plan by the 13th of this month, with an output increase of 1.9 times compared with the same period last year, and various economic indicators also increased significantly.

In order to guarantee the overfulfillment of the iron smelting plan in the first half of this year, the company's leaders at all levels went deep into the front line of production, firmly grasped the key to production, and truly ensured that there were cadres in every shift and cadres in every furnace. Therefore, production has been constantly increasing.

The widespread launch of the technical revolution movement is an important reason for Ma'anshan Steel's early completion of the pig iron plan for the first half of the year. In the past five months, Ma'anshan Steel has generally carried out technical transformation of large and small blast furnaces and organized multiple study teams to retrieve a lot of advanced experience from Anshan, Zhengzhou, and other places.

Zhejiang Relies on Technical Revolution, Small-Scale Indigenous Groups, Comprehensive Utilization, and Large-Scale Collaboration

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou: More than 670 factories and mines in Zhejiang Province have completed half of their annual major product, output value, labor productivity, and cost plans ahead of schedule.

The more than 670 factories and mines in Zhejiang Province that have completed half of their annual plans ahead of schedule share a common experience, that is, realizing a great leap forward in production must rely on "five things": first, technical innovation and technical revolution; second, "small-scale indigenous groups" and "small-scale modern groups"; third, comprehensive utilization of resources; fourth, communist large-scale collaboration; and fifth, continuous adjustment of the superstructure and relations of production.

These factories and mines that have completed their annual plans ahead of schedule have achieved significant results in carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution this year. The Xiaoshan Electric Motor Factory alone has realized thousands of innovative proposals in the past five months, transforming many production processes from manual operation to mechanization, semi-mechanization, or semi-automation. The Jinhua Vehicle Factory achieved more than 200 innovation projects from January to May, which increased the daily output of the main product, two-wheeled vehicles, more than three times compared with the fourth quarter of last year. Among these factories and mines that have completed their annual plans, many are "small-scale indigenous groups" and "small-scale modern groups" enterprises, and their production capacity has been newly developed in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. Due to the vigorous promotion of comprehensive utilization of resources, many factories and mines have realized turning waste into treasure, turning harmful things into beneficial things, and turning one thing for one use into one thing for multiple uses, thus greatly promoting the early completion of production tasks.

Hubei Focuses on Overproduction; Cadres Go Deep into the Front Line; Promoting "Four Modernizations"; Production Efficiency Increases Daily

According to Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan: 213 factories and mines in Hubei Province, such as Wuhan Boiler Factory, Shashi Rubber Factory, Yichang Electric Motor Factory, and Daye Tieshan Iron and Steel Factory, completed half of their annual product output plan one month ahead of schedule.

These factories and mines have been vigorously promoting technical revolution centered on the "Four Modernizations" since the beginning of this year, racing against time, seizing high output, and widely promoting dozens of new technologies with significant meaning, such as saving fuel and "four-in-one" power supply, which has led to a leap in production efficiency.

In the process of racing against time and seizing high output, leading cadres at all levels have gone deep into key factories and mines to strengthen leadership and firmly grasp production. The Party committees of the nine bureaus in Wuhan City have a total of 39 standing committee members, of which 36 standing committee members are assigned to specific areas and factories to help with their work. This ensures the overfulfillment of the plan.

Shanxi Exceeds the First Quarter in the Second Quarter; Striving for Progress with Redoubled Efforts; Going to the Front Line; Breaking Through Key Points Step by Step

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan: As of the 16th of this month, more than 100 factories and mines in Shanxi Province, including Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory, Taiyuan Boiler Factory, Datong Cement Factory, Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory, and Taiyuan Dongshan Coal Mine, have completed more than half of their annual national output value and output plans ahead of schedule.

After achieving a complete victory in the first five months of this year, the workers of these factories and mines launched a production competition movement to exceed the first quarter in the second quarter with redoubled efforts; at the same time, the leading cadres of each factory and mine also personally went to the front line of production to solve key production problems and tried every means to apply the results of the technical revolution to production in a timely and extensive manner, which promoted a large-scale leap in production. In the past two months, the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory has identified more than 380 major innovation projects through large-scale summary and promotion, and 60% of them have been used in production; in the process of summary and promotion, the workers have also put forward more than 3,000 innovative proposals, most of which have been used in current production, so that the factory completed the production plan for the first half of the year ahead of schedule at the end of May.

In promoting, consolidating, and improving the results of technical innovation, these factories and mines have also vigorously engaged in diversified operations and comprehensive utilization, adding a large number of new raw materials, which has ensured a large-scale leap in production. As a result of carrying out comprehensive utilization, the Taiyuan Plastics Factory has not only ensured monthly overproduction but also increased more than 20 new products.

Inner Mongolia Grasps Tightly and Carefully, Starting Early Rather Than Late; Small-Scale Modern Groups and Small-Scale Indigenous Groups Make Great Contributions to Increased Production

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot: As of now, more than 150 factories and mines in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, including Baotou Steel Smelting Plant, Baotou Sugar Factory, and Daci Coal Mine, have completed and overfulfilled the output value and product output plans for the first half of the year ahead of schedule.

Since the beginning of this year, these factories and mines have consistently implemented the spirit of constantly encouraging efforts, starting early rather than late. Leading cadres go deep into the front line, grasping today and tomorrow with one hand, grasping early, grasping tightly, and grasping carefully. Therefore, they have ensured the seamless connection of production, the tight connection of each link, and greatly promoted the high-speed development of production and construction.

These factories and mines have conscientiously implemented the policy of walking on two legs in production and vigorously carried out diversified operations and comprehensive utilization. The Baotou Sugar Factory has adopted the method of self-reliance, vigorously developing small-scale indigenous groups and small-scale modern groups, and vigorously grasping the comprehensive utilization of raw materials, which not only guaranteed the early completion of the production tasks for the first half of the year but also produced many new products such as steel, calcium carbide, and lime.

Guangzhou Vigorously Engages in Diversified Operations and Comprehensive Utilization; Increasing the Production of More and Better Raw Materials

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou: The Guangzhou industrial front has reported frequent good news in the midst of the great battle in June: As of the 10th of this month, more than 140 factories in the city, including Guangzhou Textile Machinery Factory, Southern Bakelite Factory, and Hongdu Optical Instrument Factory, have completed their production plans for the first half of the year and entered the third quarter ahead of schedule.

These factories, in response to the new situation that the demand for raw materials has greatly increased after the in-depth development of the technical revolution and the improvement of production capacity, have vigorously carried out diversified operations and comprehensive utilization of raw materials, which has played a significant role in ensuring the early completion of the production plan for the first half of the year. The Zhujiang Dyeing and Finishing Factory suffered from insufficient supply of caustic soda, so the workers not only tried every means to save and use it in the factory but also used the electrolyte produced by other factories in the production process to process and refine it into caustic soda, thereby completing 52% of the annual plan one month ahead of schedule. Due to the development of production, the planned supply of materials for the Guangzhou Instrument Factory since May could not meet the production needs, so the workers in the factory vigorously engaged in conservation, substitution, and full utilization of waste materials, thereby ensuring that the output of the four major products, namely oil pressure gauges, water temperature gauges, ammeters, and gasoline gauges, all completed and exceeded the plan for the first half of the year ahead of schedule, and the product quality was also qualified after inspection.

Chongqing Vigorously Engages in the "One-Like" Movement; Working Together to Catch Up with Advanced Levels

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing: A batch of transportation and construction units in Chongqing City have completed half of their annual plans ahead of schedule. These units include Chongqing Automobile Transportation Company, Chongqing Water Transportation Company, Chongqing First Construction Company, Sichuan Provincial Second Industrial Equipment Installation Company, and Chongqing Industrial Installation Company.

In order to ensure the early completion of the national plan for the first half of this year, these units have fully launched a movement to be "one-like" with the advanced. In the movement, the workers generally put forward the collective and individual goals and formulated plans and measures to catch up with the advanced. After the Chongqing Automobile Transportation Company fully launched the "one-like" movement, it greatly tapped the potential of automobile transportation, realized that one vehicle is equivalent to two vehicles, and the vehicle ton-kilometers and freight volume rose sharply. The average vehicle ton-month output of the entire company rapidly increased from more than 7,900 ton-kilometers to 22,000 ton-kilometers. After the Chongqing Handling and Loading Company launched the "one-like" movement centered on the realization of "May Day indicators" (that is, transporting one ton of goods in no more than one minute, each person transporting 100 tons of goods per day, each group transporting 1,000 tons of goods per day, each team transporting 10,000 tons of goods per day, and the entire company transporting 1 million tons of goods per month), the average efficiency per person per day rapidly increased from 11 tons to 38 tons, and the entire company overfulfilled the annual plan seven months and three days ahead of schedule.
