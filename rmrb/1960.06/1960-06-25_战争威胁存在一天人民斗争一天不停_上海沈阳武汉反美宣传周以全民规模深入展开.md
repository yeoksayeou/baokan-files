Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 23rd: In recent days, Shanghai's "Anti-American Imperialist Aggression, Resolutely Liberate Taiwan, Defend World Peace Propaganda Week" has been unfolding extensively and deeply on a mass scale. Throughout the city's factories, shops, schools, and neighborhoods, report meetings, forums, broadcast meetings, poetry and painting competitions are being held everywhere. Men and women, young and old, share the same hatred for the enemy, and slogans and songs of "We must liberate Taiwan" and "Fully support the world's people's struggle against American imperialism and to defend peace" resound on both sides of the Huangpu River. The State No. 2 Cotton Mill, which has a glorious tradition of anti-imperialist struggle and where Gu Zhenghong, a martyr of the May 30th Movement, worked, is covered with slogans, propaganda posters, and poems and cartoons created by workers. The workers have also created more than a dozen living newspapers that tour the factory. Sun Lin, a veteran worker from the Korean War at the Hualin Electric Appliance Factory, who was cited for meritorious service three times on the Korean battlefield, said: We have competed with American imperialism, and the facts have proved that it is a "paper tiger," but as long as imperialism exists, the threat of war exists. We must expose it and fight it every day without stopping.
    In the various activities of the propaganda week, the people of Shanghai angrily denounced American imperialism's occupation of our territory of Taiwan and shouted slogans to liberate Taiwan everywhere. Liu Shitong, a 66-year-old former pedicab worker, said at a forum: My son, Liu Wankang, was also a pedicab worker, and he was beaten to death by American soldiers before liberation. I hate American imperialism to the core. Now the compatriots in Taiwan are still suffering from the pain of American imperialism, and we must liberate Taiwan!
    At noon today, the news that Nobusuke Kishi, the running dog of American imperialism and Prime Minister of Japan, was forced to step down reached Shanghai. People warmly hailed this victory of the Japanese people's patriotic struggle against American imperialism and unanimously expressed their continued support for the Japanese people's struggle to completely smash the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. Veteran workers and advanced producers of the Jiangnan Shipyard held a forum. Famous advanced producer Wu Xiankang said: Kishi's forced resignation is a victory won by the Japanese people with blood and with the support of the people of all countries. Recently, Syngman Rhee stepped down, Menderes stepped down, and Kishi stepped down. All this shows the strength of the people's power, and the doomsday of imperialism and reactionaries is not far away. He said: As a Chinese worker, I firmly stand with the Japanese workers and support them in preventing the emergence of a second Kishi Nobusuke and support their struggle to smash the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." Lu Zutong and Shen Ruigu, elderly shop assistants of Wing On Company, said at the forum that Eisenhower had a cold reception in the face of the Japanese people's fists, and Kishi had to announce his resignation. This is a heavy blow to the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. However, the reactionaries are never willing to fail, and the aggressive nature of imperialism will never change. The U.S.-Japanese reactionaries are trying to use Kishi's resignation to divert the Japanese people's struggle goals, paralyze the people's fighting spirit, and stabilize their ruling position. This struggle is still developing. We will continue to support the Japanese people's struggle and smash the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.
    The Student Union of Jiaotong University also held a forum this afternoon. Long Lehao, the vice chairman of the Student Union, congratulated the Japanese university students on the victory of the Japanese people forcing Kishi Nobusuke to step down on behalf of more than 7,000 students in the school.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, June 23rd: Various activities of Shenyang's Anti-American Imperialist Aggression, Resolutely Liberate Taiwan, and Defend World Peace Propaganda Week have been fully launched. In recent days, from cinemas and theaters to all public places, from streets to alleys, the anger against American imperialist aggression has been ignited everywhere, and war songs supporting the just struggle of the people of Asian countries have been sung everywhere.
    This heroic city, which sent tens of thousands of outstanding sons and daughters and contributed a large amount of materials in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, expressed its utmost indignation at the towering crimes of American imperialism on the eve of the tenth anniversary of the U.S. imperialist aggression against Korea. People are enthusiastically watching films about the anti-American struggle. In the first two days of the film exhibition, more than 200,000 people watched movies such as "Asian Storm" and "Support the Japanese People's Struggle Against the U.S.-Japan Military Alliance Treaty." After watching the films, many viewers' will to fight against American imperialism became even higher, and they wrote on the cinema's message board: American imperialism's two-faced tactics of false peace, real war preparation, false easing, and real aggression cannot deceive the Chinese people. People also expressed their firm opposition to American imperialist aggression and their determination to liberate Taiwan.
    Various theaters in Shenyang are successively staging plays such as "The Roar of the Taiwanese People" and "Tokyo Storm." All teachers and students of the Luxun Academy of Fine Arts actively participated in the propaganda activities. In more than a day, they created more than 400 pictures. The teachers and students used propaganda posters, cartoons, and sculptures to profoundly expose the warlike nature of American imperialism and strongly express the Chinese people's determination to oppose American imperialist aggression.
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, June 24th: Since Wuhan launched the "Anti-American Imperialist Aggression, Resolutely Liberate Taiwan, and Defend World Peace Propaganda Week" on the 21st, more than 40 theaters, clubs, and cultural palaces in the city have staged or added performances of dramas, folk arts, dances, and other programs with anti-American struggle as their theme. Various professional and amateur troupes have also gone to the streets to perform. The film "Shangganling," which was screened in Wuhan in 1957, is still as full as a new film. Wuhan Radio has also broadcast programs about the anti-American struggle for days.
    In this large-scale anti-American propaganda activity, the literary and art circles took the lead. The playwrights and actors of the city's professional troupes actively participated in the creation and performance activities related to the anti-American struggle. According to statistics, more than 300 folk art, drama, and singing materials with the theme of anti-American struggle have been created in the city. Zhou Zhongquan and Huang Yutang, the famous Yugu actors of the Wuhan Quyi Team who had just returned from touring performances in various places, were filled with righteous indignation when they saw the news in the newspaper on the 17th that the "plague god" Eisenhower had gone to Taiwan. They immediately compiled the Yugu "Driving Away the Plague God" and "Besieged on All Sides" and performed it that night. Under their leadership, all the actors in the team immediately launched a creative activity and created many short and concise programs, which have been performed in special performances for days since the 18th. The actors of the Wuhan Chu Opera Troupe created and rushed to rehearse eight political satire dramas and living newspapers such as "The Roar of the Chinese People," "Flames of Anger," and "Rats Crossing the Street," which have been performed more than 20 times and are popular with the audience. The actors of the Mianyang Flower Drum Opera Troupe, which is performing in Wuhan, have even higher creative enthusiasm, and they have created and performed dozens of programs in just two or three days. The political satire drama "The Doomsday of the Plague God" collectively created and performed by the actors of the Wuhan Han Opera Troupe is very popular with the audience. Whenever the scene of the American imperialism and its running dogs being shamefully defeated is performed, it provokes a contemptuous laughter from the whole audience. The Wuhan Peking Opera Troupe, which has been to Korea and the Fujian front several times to perform慰问, performed the Peking Opera "The End of the Plague God" which they collectively created.
    The art workers of Wuhan have created and copied more than 300 cartoons after two days of hard work, and they have personally posted these cartoons in the city's galleries.

    战争威胁存在一天人民斗争一天不停
    上海沈阳武汉反美宣传周以全民规模深入展开
    据新华社上海23日电　这几天来，上海市“反对美帝侵略、坚决解放台湾、保卫世界和平宣传周”正以全民规模广泛深入地开展。全市工厂、商店、学校、里弄，到处都在举行报告会、座谈会、广播会、赛诗赛画会。男女老少同仇敌忾，“一定要解放台湾”，“全力支持世界人民反对美帝、保卫和平的斗争”的口号声、歌唱声，响彻了黄浦江两岸。具有反帝斗争光荣传统、“五卅”烈士顾正红工作过的国棉二厂，全厂到处贴着反对美帝国主义的标语、宣传画和工人创作的诗歌、漫画，工人们还创作了十多个活报剧在厂内巡回演出。华林电器厂的志愿军复员工人孙林，曾在朝鲜战场上立过三次功，他说：我们与美帝国主义较量过，事实证明它是“纸老虎”，但帝国主义存在一天，战争威胁就存在一天，我们就要一天不停止地揭露它、和它斗争。
    在宣传周的各种活动中，上海人民愤怒斥责美帝国主义侵占我国领土台湾，到处发出解放台湾的吼声——六十六岁的前三轮车老工人刘士同在一个座谈会上说：我的儿子刘万康也是三轮车工人，在解放前给美国兵拳打脚踢打死的，我恨透了美帝国主义，现在台湾同胞还在受美帝国主义的苦痛，我们一定要解放台湾！
    今天中午，美帝国主义走狗日本首相岸信介被迫宣布下台的消息传到上海，人们热烈欢呼日本人民反对美帝国主义的爱国斗争的这一胜利，并一致表示继续支持日本人民斗争，彻底粉碎日美军事同盟条约。江南造船厂的老工人与先进生产者们举行了座谈会，著名先进生产者邬显康说：岸信介的被迫下台，是日本人民在各国人民支持下用鲜血取得的一个胜利。最近以来，李承晚下台，曼德列斯下台，岸信介下台，这一切显示了人民力量的强大，帝国主义和反动派的末日已经不远了。他说：我作为一个中国工人，坚决与日本工人站在一起，支持他们阻止第二个岸信介的出现，支持他们为粉碎日美新“安全条约”而进行的斗争。永安公司的老年店员陆祖同和沈瑞谷在座谈会上说，艾森豪威尔在日本人民拳头面前吃了闭门羹，岸信介又不得不宣布辞职，这是人民力量给日美反动派的一个沉重打击。但是反动派决不甘心于失败，帝国主义的侵略本质决不会改变，美日反动派企图用岸信介的下台的办法，来转移日本人民的斗争目标，麻痹人民的斗志，稳定它们的统治地位。这个斗争还在继续发展。我们继续支持日本人民斗争，粉碎日美军事同盟条约。
    交通大学学生会今天下午也举行座谈会，学生会副主席龙乐豪代表全校七千多学生向日本大学生祝贺日本人民迫使岸信介下台的胜利。
    据新华社沈阳23日电　沈阳市反对美帝侵略、坚决解放台湾、保卫世界和平宣传周的各项活动，已全面展开。连日来，从影院、剧院到一切公共场所，从大街到小巷，到处都燃烧起反对美帝侵略的怒火，到处都高唱着支持亚洲各国人民正义斗争的战歌。
    这座在抗美援朝战争中曾经派出成千上万个优秀儿女，献出大量物资的英雄城市，在美帝侵朝战争十周年的前夕，对美帝国主义的滔天罪行，表示万分愤慨。人们踊跃观看有关反美斗争的影片。在电影展览开始的头两天里，已有二十多万人次观看了“亚洲风暴”、“支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争”等电影。许多观众看了电影以后，反对美帝的斗争意志更加高涨，纷纷在影院的留言簿上写道：美帝国主义假和平、真备战，假缓和、真侵略的两面手法，是蒙骗不了中国人民的。人们还表示了坚决反对美帝国主义侵略，一定要解放台湾的决心。
    沈阳市各个剧场，正在陆续上演“台湾人民的怒吼”、“东京风暴”等剧目。鲁迅美术学院全体师生积极投入了宣传活动，在一天多的时间内，他们就创造出四百多幅画面。师生们运用了宣传画、漫画和雕塑等形式，深刻地揭露了美帝国主义的好战本性，强烈地表达了中国人民反对美帝国主义侵略的决心。
    据新华社武汉24日电　武汉市从21日开始举行“反对美帝侵略、坚决解放台湾、保卫世界和平宣传周”以来，全市四十多家戏院、剧场、俱乐部和文化宫都专场演出或加演了以反美斗争为题材的戏剧、曲艺、舞蹈等节目，各专业和业余剧团还纷纷到街头演出。全市三十多家电影院都连场放映了有关反美斗争的影片。1957年曾在武汉放映过的影片“上甘岭”，仍然像新片一样场场客满。武汉广播电台也连日广播了有关反美斗争的节目。
    在这声势浩大的反美宣传活动中，文艺界一马当先，全市专业剧团的剧作者和演员们都积极投入了有关反美斗争的创作和演出活动。据统计，目前全市已创作了以反美斗争为题材的曲艺、戏剧、演唱材料等三百多个。刚从各地巡回演出回来的武汉曲艺队著名渔鼓演员周忠全、黄玉堂，17日从报上看到“瘟神”艾森豪威尔到台湾的消息后，义愤填膺，当天就编出了渔鼓“赶瘟神”、“四面楚歌”，并在当晚演出。这个队的全体演员在他俩的带动下，也立即掀起了创作活动，创作了许多短小精悍的节目，从18日开始就连日专场演出。武汉楚剧团的演员们创作和赶排了楚剧“中国人民的怒吼”、“愤怒的火焰”、“老鼠过街”等八个政治讽刺剧和活报剧，并已演出了二十多场，受到观众的欢迎。正在武汉演出的沔阳花鼓剧团的演员们，创作热情更高，在短短的两三天内就创作和演出了几十个节目。武汉市汉剧团演员集体创作和演出的政治讽刺剧“瘟神末日”，深受观众的欢迎，每当演到美帝国主义和它的走狗们遭到可耻的失败情景时，都引起全场一片轻蔑的嘲笑声。曾经几次到朝鲜和福建前线进行慰问演出的武汉市京剧团，演出了他们集体创作的京剧“瘟神的末路”。
    武汉的美术工作者经过两天奋战，已创作和复制了漫画三百多幅，并亲自把这些漫画张贴到市区的画廊里。
