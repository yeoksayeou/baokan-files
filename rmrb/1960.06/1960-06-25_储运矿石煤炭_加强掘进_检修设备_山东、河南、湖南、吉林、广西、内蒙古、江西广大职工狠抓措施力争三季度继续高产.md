Shandong: Taking Measures to Ensure Continuous Leap Forward During the Hot and Rainy Season

(Our Dispatch from Jinan, June 24) The broad masses of workers on Shandong Province's iron and steel front, while waging a great battle in June, are actively preparing for the third quarter's production.

In order to enable the continuous leap forward of iron and steel production in the hot and rainy third quarter, iron mine workers in various regions are taking the lead, launching a double high tide of production and technological transformation to continuously increase ore production. At the same time, various regions have also rushed to produce a batch of advanced ore powder sintering equipment. The Provincial Metallurgical Industry Department recently allocated a large number of magnets for various regions to vigorously develop water-magnetic joint ore dressing to improve the grade of concentrate. Through these measures, it is ensured that blast furnaces are well-fed and have a surplus.

Ensuring smooth transportation during the rainy season is an important part of improving steel production. In order to rush to transport ore, coke, and other raw materials before the rainy season, various regions have strengthened cooperation, rationally organized and deployed labor and transportation tools, and vigorously promoted short-distance transportation.

Various iron and steel enterprises have carefully inspected and repaired smelting equipment. In addition, many regions and factories and mines have made early arrangements for rain and lightning protection and heatstroke prevention and cooling measures, building material warehouses, rain shelters, drainage ditches, flood control embankments, lightning protection equipment, as well as cool sheds, shower rooms, etc. Appropriate adjustments have also been made to the types of work for some workers who are not suitable for high-temperature operations.

Henan: Equipment Maintenance and Repair Ensured for Normal Operation in the Third Quarter

(Our Dispatch from Zhengzhou, June 24) The industrial and transportation front in Henan Province, in order to ensure a greater increase in production in the third quarter, while vigorously grasping the comprehensive completion of half of the year's plan in June, is actively preparing for the third quarter's production from ideological and material aspects.

In order to ensure the further leap forward of industrial production in the third quarter, various regions, according to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, have universally carried out a general mobilization of ideas to boost morale and vigorously implement measures. In the preparation for the third quarter's production, many enterprises have carried out planned maintenance on the original equipment, and some have also added new equipment. In terms of iron and steel, the province has taken effective measures to ensure that a new 200-cubic-meter furnace is opened before July 1st, and the furnace opening rate will be increased from the current 70% to over 80%.

Caring for the lives of workers and strengthening safety production work, focusing on "four preventions" (heatstroke prevention, flood prevention, rain prevention, and lightning protection), has become one of the important aspects of vigorously grasping the preparation for the third quarter's production. In addition to making full use of the original four-prevention equipment from last year, various regions have also rushed to produce 500 spray fans, 100 mine ventilation fans, 200 fans, and 600 square meters of materials for cool sheds.

Hunan: Department and Bureau Leaders Go Deep into the Front Lines to Grasp Tunneling, Equipment Repair, and Short-Distance Transportation

(Our Dispatch from Changsha, June 24) While the product output of industrial and mining enterprises in Hunan Province has increased substantially in the great battle of June, they have deeply mobilized the masses to vigorously grasp the production and transfer of raw materials, focusing on coal and ore, strengthen equipment maintenance and repair work, and actively prepare for another peak in the third quarter.

Under the encouragement of the slogan "Guarantee Steel with Coal," coal mine workers in various regions are grasping production on one hand and tunneling on the other, expanding the amount of coal mined. Coal mine workers in the Hengyang area are actively increasing tunneling speed and replenishing the tunneling team, increasing the tunneling efficiency of the entire area by more than 34%. In order to expand the production capacity of coal and ore, as of now, more than 700 pairs of new and restored small coal mines have been established throughout the province, and most of the coal mines have now begun production. While vigorously grasping the production of coal and ore, the province has newly organized more than 6,000 short-distance transportation teams to work with professional transportation departments to vigorously grasp the short-distance transportation of coal, coke, and ore.

At present, the frontline command post organized by the Hunan Provincial Party Committee, headed by Comrade Yu Mingtao, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, has gone deep into key areas to command the battle. The relevant departments and bureaus have drawn 30 cadres at the level of department and bureau chiefs from 16 departments and bureaus to organize 7 professional groups, which have been sent to key iron mines, coal mines, stations, and ports to specifically organize production and continue the leap forward.

Jilin: Developing Diversified Operations to Prepare More and Better Raw Materials
