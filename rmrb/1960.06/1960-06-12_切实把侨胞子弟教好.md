Resolutely Educate the Children of Overseas Chinese Well
Representative of Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Primary School, Guangdong Province: Qu Huifang

    The motherland is a strong backing for overseas Chinese. In order to enable the children of overseas Chinese to receive education from the motherland, the Party and the People's Government established the Overseas Chinese Primary School in the Overseas Chinese New Village in the eastern district of Guangzhou in 1955. When the school first opened, due to the lack of experience of our school staff and the inability to grasp the characteristics of overseas Chinese students, the school order could not be established for a time, and chaos occurred for a while. The moral character and academic performance of the students were not satisfactory, and it was a third-class school in the eastern district of Guangzhou. Many parents of our school's students are still overseas, and the quality of the students' education will have a certain impact on overseas Chinese. All staff members of our school realized the importance of their work, resolutely implemented the Party's education policy, and overcame the serious difficulties encountered in the work process. Since the Great Leap Forward, our school has made some achievements in changing the moral character of students. "The Communist Party is good, the motherland is good" has become the firm belief of the children, and labor is glorious has become the fashion of this collective. The communist style of "one for all, selflessness for the collective" is constantly being promoted among teachers and students. Academic performance is also constantly improving. Some children have gradually progressed from not understanding the language and writing of the motherland to being able to use them proficiently. In the unified test of Chinese and arithmetic in the first to sixth grades in the first semester of 1959, our school ranked first and second in the district. In the mid-term exam of this semester, the scores of some classes and subjects all reached excellent and good, and the Chinese scores of the sixth grade completely eliminated the two-point scores, and the four- and five-point scores reached 95%. The enrollment rate of previous graduating classes is also very high, averaging 99%. Because our school pays attention to carrying out productive labor and small and diverse cultural and sports activities, the children's physical and mental health can develop healthily, and their physical fitness is constantly improving. Our school's youth soccer team won the city championship in the 1959 competition. In the same year, our school won the first place in the overall team score in the district's youth sports meet. Music and dance with overseas ethnic characteristics have been well received and rewarded in every performance. Due to some achievements in our work, since 1958, our school has become a first-class school in the eastern district of Guangzhou, playing a good political influence among overseas Chinese at home and abroad. The progress of our school shows the superiority of socialist education, is the victory of the Party's education policy, and is the result of the collective labor of all staff members of our school under the leadership of the Party.

    Our school's students include the children of overseas Chinese from thirty-three countries. Overseas, many of them have been poisoned by Western bourgeois ideology. On the other hand, because they have been subjected to varying degrees of oppression overseas, they generally have the characteristics of loving the motherland, valuing learning, and enjoying activities. According to the Party's education policy, we repeatedly educate students in light of these characteristics, and teachers set an example and constantly influence and guide them, so as to achieve the above results. In our work, our experience is as follows:

    First, we must adhere to putting politics in command, conscientiously implement the policy towards intellectuals, and give full play to the enthusiasm of teachers.

    Most of the teachers and other staff members of our school are also returned overseas Chinese. They have the enthusiasm to serve the motherland, but a few of them lack the spirit of hard struggle. Therefore, when personal interests conflict with collective interests, they often have nostalgic emotions for overseas. Teachers transferred from other schools believe that students are difficult to teach, and some are not at ease. In response to this situation, the Party strengthened its leadership over our school, adhered to putting politics in command, conscientiously implemented the Party's policy towards intellectuals and the Party's education policy, especially through the 1957 rectification campaign and the 1959 general line education movement, focusing on criticizing the teachers' bourgeois ideas of greed for ease and comfort, helping them analyze the essence and harm of this idea, and understanding the correctness and greatness of the Party, greatly improving the teachers' political consciousness. In order to help teachers clarify the glory and arduousness of their tasks and overcome their uneasiness, the school Party organization specially invited responsible comrades from the Municipal Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau to the school to give reports, talking about relevant overseas Chinese policies and the importance of running overseas Chinese schools well, which greatly enlightened the teachers. Everyone realized that the quality of their work is directly related to the Party's prestige among overseas Chinese and the motherland's reputation in the international community. Everyone said that they must overcome individualism, settle down, and be determined to do a good job. The school Party organization also attaches great importance to grasping the ideological trends of teachers and carrying out the ideological struggle between the two roads to ensure the completion of education tasks. In recent years, the teachers' ideological awareness in our school has improved rapidly. They resolutely support the Party's leadership and give full play to their soaring energy. Many teachers said: "We must listen to the Party and work hard, and we must never let the Party down for its care and education." Because under the leadership of the Party, leading cadres can unite and form a core, and give full play to the enthusiasm of all teachers, the school work has achieved great results.

    Second, we have strengthened patriotic and internationalist education, and vigorously cultivated the fine qualities of loving the motherland, loving the people, loving labor, and loving public property.

    According to the characteristics of students' insufficient understanding of the Party and the motherland, our school attaches great importance to conducting patriotic and internationalist education for students. Our school has insisted on giving political lessons to senior students every week from 1958 to the present. Special reports were made to the students on issues such as the US imperialism's provocation, the Tibetan incident, the anti-Chinese incident in Indonesia, and the people's communes. Through recalling and comparing, they realized the essence of capitalist countries and stimulated their feelings of loving the Party and the motherland. The children felt very indignant at the actions of anti-communist elements in capitalist countries. They asked to hold a conference to protest against imperialism's aggression and the exclusion of overseas Chinese. Dai Kun, a fourth-grade student, said: "I have been to many places, the United States, Britain, and France, where I see people oppressing people and people exploiting people. Only the motherland has true freedom and equality. The motherland is better than overseas, and the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao is top-notch."

    Our school also often pays attention to conducting moral character education through daily life, such as movies and stories, commending good people and good deeds, etc., establishing red flags, and holding large team theme meetings such as "Learning from Sister Xiang Xiuli" and "Learning from Excellent Team Member Liu Wenxue" to educate students to learn from their selfless communist style. The vivid deeds of these heroic figures deeply moved the hearts of every child. Often after studying such a topic, children who are usually lazy get up early the next day to study, breaking the routine, and children with prominent shortcomings in certain aspects also automatically express their determination to correct their mistakes to the teacher. Of course, the progress of children is not very stable at once, but after repeated and continuous education, they understand the meaning of life, and the excellent qualities of "one for all, selflessness for the collective" have gradually grown in the children's hearts. One night in the autumn of 1958, a fire broke out at the construction site of the Overseas Chinese New Village, and more than 100 teachers and students from the school rushed to the scene to rescue. At that time, the fire was raging, and the bamboo and wood were exploding. In order to rescue state property, the teachers and students climbed bamboo racks without regard for their own safety, dismantled lime sheds, and cut off the fire. They were suffocated by the thick smoke to tears, and several students were injured but still insisted on staying on the fire line until the fire was extinguished. The brave behavior of the teachers and students was commended and rewarded by the Public Security Bureau and the New Village Engineering Team. The children are very willing to help others. When they see a blind person having difficulty walking, they take him to the station to take a bus. When workers push a large flatbed truck up a slope, the Young Pioneers step forward to help. A student who used to steal a lot can now immediately hand over the gold chain he picked up to the teacher, and some actively try to find out the address and unit of the owner and send the original items to Hubei, Nanjing and other places. Not picking up money has become a fashion.

    Under the strong leadership of the Party, our school resolutely implements the policy of combining education with productive labor, vigorously engages in productive labor, and strengthens labor education. Through planting vegetables, raising pigs, chickens, rabbits, etc., they understand the truth that "labor creates everything" from labor practice. One student said: "It feels particularly delicious to eat the fish I raised." In the Great Leap Forward in steelmaking and the health campaign, students were very enthusiastic and energetic, and the influence of the exploiting class's habits of laziness and ease was greatly reduced. Many parents wrote letters saying: "The children have been studying in the motherland for less than half a year, and under the education of the motherland, the habits of young ladies and young masters have changed greatly." An overseas Chinese from Cambodia has a daughter studying in our school. The child's progress makes him very excited. He said to his friends overseas: "The child is making rapid progress under the education of the motherland." And he continued to send his two daughters, an only son, and a niece back to study. …

    Third, while paying attention to moral education, we have also promoted the spirit of diligent teaching and hard study, and tried every means to improve the quality of education.

    Because the students come from overseas and are admitted as they come, many students have very poor Chinese proficiency, and some even do not understand the language of the motherland and regard learning as dispensable. In this case, teachers, on the one hand, induce children to gradually understand why they are studying and clarify the direction of their lives. On the other hand, they focus on important links such as preparing lessons and giving lectures. Teachers are meticulous regardless of whether they are in sports or at the busiest time of work, and often work until late at night. And create a variety of lively teaching methods to stimulate students' enthusiasm for learning. Teachers attach great importance to combining with the actual situation of overseas Chinese students and strengthening individual tutoring to eliminate backward achievements. For students who have great difficulties in learning, teachers use all spare time to approach them and help them learn the language and writing of the motherland. Some students have gradually learned to speak fluent Mandarin and write fluent articles from not understanding how to speak. For example, several students in the second grade, such as Dai Guowei, did not understand the language of the motherland when they first came. The class teacher often used pictures, objects, English translation of Chinese characters, pinyin and other methods to conduct individual tutoring, teaching them to recognize words and learn to speak word by word. And often use rest time for individual tutoring. Facts have proved that individual tutoring has played a great role in eliminating backward achievements, and some classes and subjects have completely eliminated the phenomenon of failure. When students are sick, teachers personally go to their homes and hospitals to give them extra lessons. When students are afraid to go home after studying at night, teachers personally send them back. This spirit of being responsible and loving students deeply moved students and parents. Parents, with infinite love for the Party and the motherland, gave teachers a high evaluation and encouragement in their work; an old grandmother of a student held the teacher's hand and said kindly: "Teacher, you have worked hard, and you have taught my grandson well." Dai Guowei's father (an overseas Chinese from Peru, South America) said: "I have been to more than 20 countries, and I have never seen a teacher in the motherland so fully responsible."

    Fourth, respect teachers and love students, care for each other, and form a united and friendly big family.

    Under the leadership of the Party, all teachers and students in the school have formed a strong collective. Teachers realize that most of the children's parents are overseas, and they should bear the dual responsibility of teachers and mothers. Therefore, teachers care for them meticulously from morning to night. When students are sick, they take them to the hospital for treatment; they take them out of school for activities during holidays; teachers often go to class for tutoring; some children shit in bed, and teachers personally help them wash; some students' mosquito nets are broken, and male teachers also help them sew them. The teachers' love for the students gives the children a great infection. They deeply feel that "the school is home, and the teacher is mom." When some teachers are sick, the whole class goes to their homes to visit them and bring meals to their beds. Sometimes teachers put their clothes in the bathroom, and the children quietly take them away to wash them. They not only care for teachers in life, but also care for teachers politically. When a child knows that the class teacher's lover is a rightist, he reminds the teacher to stand firm; some children also give the teacher a book "How to be a Communist Party Member" in the hope that the teacher will create conditions and strive to join the Party as soon as possible. Genuine friendship has also been established among the children. Friendship encourages them to make progress faster and learn better. Some children forget to eat when working in the fields, and other children send food to the fields; some children are sick, and other children go to visit him and help him make up lessons so that he can make progress with the collective; such moving examples are endless in the Overseas Chinese Primary School. Teachers and students live in this big family and feel infinitely kind and warm. When parents or foreign guests ask them about their views on the motherland and the school, they get the same answer: "The motherland is good, the school is good."

    The above are the little achievements and experiences in our work. The achievements are the result of the Party's correct leadership. Our work is still far from meeting the requirements of the situation. We are determined to actively study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works, improve our political and ideological awareness, establish a proletarian world outlook, conscientiously implement the Party's education policy and overseas Chinese affairs policy, and resolutely educate the children of overseas Chinese well.

    切实把侨胞子弟教好
    广东省广州市华侨小学代表　区惠芳
    祖国是华侨有力的靠山。为了使华侨子弟能接受祖国的教育，1955年党和人民政府在广州东区华侨新村建立了华侨小学。学校初开办时，由于我校工作人员缺乏经验，摸不到华侨学生的特点，学校秩序一时未能建立起来，曾一度出现混乱现象，学生的道德品质和学习成绩都不能令人满意，是广州东区的一所三类学校。我校学生家长有很多还在海外，学生教育得好与坏会在海外华侨中产生一定的反应。我校全体工作人员认识到自己工作的重要性，坚决地贯彻了党的教育方针，克服了工作过程中碰到的严重困难。大跃进以来，我校在改变学生道德品质面貌方面作出了一些成绩。“共产党好、祖国好”已成为孩子们坚定不移的信念，劳动光荣已成为这个集体的风尚。我为人人，舍己为群的共产主义风格，在师生中不断发扬。学习成绩也不断提高，有些孩子从不懂祖国语言、文字而逐渐进步到能熟练运用。1959年上学期一至六年级语文科、算术科统测中，我校名列全区第一和第二名。本学期期中测验有些班、科的成绩全部达到优秀、优良，六年级语文成绩完全消灭了二分，四、五分的达到95％，历届毕业班的升学率也很高，平均达到99％。由于我校注意开展生产劳动和小型多样的文体活动，孩子们的身心都能健康地发展，体质不断有所增强。我校的少年足球队在1959年比赛中获得全市冠军，同年我校在全区少年体运会中获得团体总成绩第一名。富有海外民族色彩的音乐舞蹈，在每次参加会演中都得到好评和奖励。由于在工作中取得了一些成绩，1958年以来，我校已成为广州市东区的一类学校，在国内外华侨中起到良好的政治影响。我们学校的进步，说明了社会主义教育的优越性，是党的教育方针的胜利，是我校全体工作人员在党的领导下，集体劳动的成果。
    我校学生包括了海外三十三个国家侨胞的子女，在海外他们有不少人受到西方资产阶级思想意识的毒害。在另一方面，他们由于在海外曾经受过各种不同程度的压迫，一般又有热爱祖国、重视学习、喜爱活动的特点。我们根据党的教育方针，针对学生的这些特点反复进行教育，教师以身作则，不断影响和引导他们，从而取得了以上的成绩。在工作中我们的体会是这样的：
    首先，必须坚持政治挂帅，认真贯彻知识分子政策，充分发挥教师的积极性。
    我们学校的教师和其他工作人员也大部分是归侨，他们有为祖国服务的热情，但少数人艰苦奋斗的精神不够，因而当个人利益与集体利益发生矛盾时，常常有留恋海外的情绪。其他学校调来的教师认为学生难教，有的也不安心。针对这种情况，党加强了对我校的领导，坚持政治挂帅，认真贯彻党对知识分子的政策及党的教育方针，特别是通过了1957年整风及1959年的总路线教育运动，着重批判了教师中贪图逸乐的资产阶级思想，帮助他们分析这种思想的本质与危害，认识党的正确与伟大，大大地提高了教师的政治觉悟。学校党组织为了帮助教师们明确任务的光荣与艰巨，克服不安于位的思想，特别请了市侨务局的负责同志来校作报告，谈及有关华侨政策及办好华侨学校的重要意义，对教师的启发很大。大家认识到工作的好坏直接关系到党在侨胞中的威信及祖国在国际中的声誉问题。大家都表示一定要克服个人主义，安下心来，决心把工作搞好。学校党组织也非常重视抓教师的思想动向，开展两条道路的思想斗争，以保证教育任务的完成。近年来，我校教师的思想觉悟提高很快，他们坚决拥护党的领导，发挥了冲天干劲。不少教师表示：
  “要听党的话，努力工作，绝不能辜负党对自己的关怀与教育”。由于在党的领导下，领导干部能团结一致形成核心，充分地发挥了全体教师的积极性，因此，学校工作取得了很大成绩。
    二、加强了爱国主义及国际主义教育，大力培养爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱公共财物的优良品质。
    根据学生对党和祖国认识不足的特点，我校非常重视对学生进行爱国主义与国际主义的教育。我校自1958年至现在，每周都坚持给高年级学生上政治课。针对美帝挑衅、西藏事件、印尼排华、人民公社等都对学生进行了专题报告，通过回忆对比，使他们认清了资本主义国家的本质，激发了他们热爱党、热爱祖国的感情。孩子们对资本主义国家反共分子的行为感到非常愤恨。纷纷要求召开大会，对帝国主义的侵略，以及排斥华侨等行为表示抗议。四年级学生戴坤说：“我去过许多地方，美国、英国、法国到处看到人压迫人，人剥削人，只有祖国才有真正的自由平等。祖国比海外好，是党和毛主席的领导顶瓜瓜”。
    我校还经常注意通过日常生活，如电影、故事进行道德品质教育，表扬好人好事等，树立红旗，还举行“学习向秀丽姐姐”“学习优秀队员刘文学”等大队主题会，教育学生学习他们大公无私的共产主义风格。这些英雄人物的生动事迹，深深地感动了每一个孩子的心，往往在学习这种专题之后，平时比较懒惰的孩子隔天一早就打破常规起来学习了，某方面缺点比较突出的孩子也自动向老师表示改过的决心了。当然，少年儿童的进步也不是一下子就很稳定的，但经过反复的不断的教育之后，使他们懂得了生活的意义，我为人人，舍己为群的优秀品质，已在孩子的心上逐步成长起来。在1958年秋天的一个晚上，华侨新村建设工地发生火警，学校一百多师生奔赴现场抢救。当时烈火熊熊，竹木爆破，师生们为了抢救国家财产，奋不顾身攀登竹架，拆卸石灰棚，断绝火路，他们被浓烟窒息到满面流泪，有几个学生受了伤仍坚持不下火线，直至扑灭烈火为止。师生的勇敢行为，受到公安局和新村工程队的通报表扬和奖励。孩子们很乐意帮助别人，看到瞎子走路有困难，便带他去车站乘车，工人叔叔推大板车上斜坡，少先队员们便上前帮助。一个过去偷窃行为很严重的学生，现在拾到金链能马上交给老师，有些还积极想办法了解失主的地址和所在单位，把原物寄到湖北、南京等地。拾金不昧已成为风尚。
    在党的坚强领导下，我校坚决贯彻教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，大搞生产劳动，加强劳动教育。使他们通过种植蔬菜，饲养猪、鸡、兔等，从劳动实践中认识“劳动创造一切的道理。有个学生说：“吃到自己养的鱼感到特别有滋味”。在大炼钢铁和卫生运动中，学生热情很高，干劲很大，剥削阶级好逸恶劳习气的影响大大减少。不少家长来信说：“孩子回祖国读书不到半年，在祖国教育下，小姐、少爷的习气改变很大”。一个柬埔寨的华侨有一个女儿在我校读书，孩子的进步使他感到很兴奋，他在海外对朋友说：“孩子在祖国的教育下进步快。”并继续将自己的两个女儿，一个独生儿子，一个侄女儿送回来学习。……
    三、在注意品德教育的同时，我们又发扬了勤教苦学的精神，千方百计提高教育质量。
    由于学生来自海外，又是随到随收，不少学生语文水平很差，有些甚至连祖国语言也不懂，把学习看为可有可无。在这种情况下，教师一面诱导孩子逐步认识学习是为了什么，明确生活方向。另方面抓紧备课讲课这些重要环节，教师们不论在运动中或工作最忙的时候，也一丝不苟，常常工作到深夜。并创造各种各样生动活泼的教学方法，以启发学生的学习积极性。教师们非常重视结合侨生的实际情况，加强个别辅导工作，消灭落后成绩。对学习上有很大困难的学生，教师就利用一切课余时间，接近他们，帮助他们学习祖国的语言文字。有些学生已从不懂讲话到逐步会流利地讲普通话和通顺地写文章了。如二年级戴国威等几个学生，初来不懂讲祖国语言，班主任便经常用图画、实物，英文译汉字、拼音等方法来进行个别辅导，一字一句地教他们认字和学话。而且常常利用休息时间进行个别辅导，事实证明，个别辅导工作，在消灭落后成绩方面起了很大的作用，有些班、科完全消灭了不及格的现象。学生病了，教师亲自到家里、医院给学生补课。学生晚上自修后怕黑不敢回家，教师就亲自送他们回去。这种认真负责，热爱学生的精神，使学生、家长深深感动，家长怀着对党和对祖国无限的热爱，给老师工作予以很高的评价和鼓舞；一个学生的老祖母拉着老师的手亲切地说：“老师，你辛苦了，把我的孙儿教好了”。戴国威的父亲（南美洲秘鲁的侨胞）说：“我到过二十多个国家，从没有看到像祖国的教师那样全面负责的。”
    四、尊师爱生，互相关心，形成团结友爱的大家庭。
    在党的领导下，全校师生已形成了坚强的集体。教师们体会到孩子的父母大部分在海外，应担负着教师和母亲的双重责任。因此教师从早到晚无微不至地关心着他们，学生生病了，带他去医院诊疗；假日休息带他们出校外活动；上自修课，教师经常下班辅导；有些孩子撒了屎在床上，教师亲自帮他们冲洗；有些学生蚊帐破了男教师也帮助他们缝补。教师热爱学生的感情给孩子们以很大的感染，他们深深地感受到“学校就是家，老师就是妈妈。”有的教师生病了，学生全班都去家里探病，将饭菜送到床前。教师有时把衣服放在洗澡房，孩子就悄悄地拿去洗干净。他们不仅在生活上关心老师，还在政治上关心老师，当一个孩子知道班主任的爱人是右派时，便提醒老师站稳立场；有的孩子还送了一本“怎样做一个共产党员”的书给老师，希望老师创造条件，早日争取入党。孩子们之间也建立了真挚的情谊。友谊鼓舞他们进步更快，学习得更好。一些孩子在田间劳动，忘记了吃饭，另一些孩子便送饭菜去田间；一些孩子病了，另一些孩子便去慰问他，帮他补习功课，使他能和集体一起进步；这样动人的事例在侨小是说不完的，师生生活在这个大家庭里，感到无限的亲切和温暖，当家长或外宾问到他们对祖国和学校的看法时，得到的是一致的回答：“祖国好，学校好。”
    以上是我们工作中的点滴成绩与体会，这些成绩的取得是党正确领导的结果，我们的工作和形势要求还相差很远，我们决心积极学习马列主义、毛主席著作，提高政治思想觉悟，确立无产阶级世界观，认真贯彻党的教育方针和侨务政策，切实把侨胞子弟教好。（附图片）
