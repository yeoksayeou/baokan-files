The rolling Wei River is a classroom everywhere. The fleet under the Linqing Shipping Station in Shandong Province, on the more than 1,000-kilometer-long route, adopts flexible methods such as equipping each boat with a teacher and setting up counselors in teams and stations. It has persisted in spare-time education for employees for four years, becoming a banner for developing spare-time education for employees and cultivating technical talents at high speed under extremely scattered and mobile conditions. At the end of last year, the unit eliminated illiteracy completely, popularized spare-time elementary education, and had 146 people enrolled in junior high school.

The Linqing Shipping Station manages many ships and has more than 800 employees. The fleet travels day and night on the Wei River, from Tianjin in the north to Xinxiang in the south, passing through more than 80 large and small wharves, with heavy transportation tasks and strong seasonality and suddenness of production. Most of the employees come from rural areas along the coast, with many old boatmen, 80% of whom are illiterate. These all bring special difficulties to employee education, and the teaching forms, teaching time, and teacher allocation are not easy to solve. However, the Party branch of the shipping station resolutely relied on the masses and, over the years, finally explored a set of methods suitable for its own characteristics to persist in spare-time education for employees.

The shipping station, based on the single-boat production, scattered personnel, and uneven levels, determined to take the single-boat learning group as the basic learning form. A total of 91 learning groups were established in the entire shipping station. Each group is led by the captain in charge of study and elects a person with a higher cultural level as the study group leader and part-time teacher. At the same time, they mobilize literate people to teach illiterate people and literate people to teach those with less literacy, and carry out mutual teaching and learning movements. But they also do not relax the opportunity for class teaching. Every time the river freezes, during winter repairs, and during the flood season when the water rises, they organize employees to study together.

In terms of study time, the fleet flexibly adopts a variety of methods according to the changes in seasons, climate, and production tasks. That is: seize the time to learn while guarding the pole in shallow water, seize the time to learn while waiting to load and unload, take turns to learn while running wind and shaking the scull, learn all day while guarding the wind and rain, and concentrate on learning during winter repairs and flood prevention. Because they compete for every minute and second and find time in their busy schedule, employees can maintain seven to eight hours of study time per week, and about 340 hours of study per year. This has enabled employees to develop good habits of learning with the boat and along the river, regardless of conditions and location. Before the development of cultural learning, the workers said: Carry the tow board day and night, and feel comfortable when the boat arrives at the wharf; after drinking four taels of old wine, just lie down on the bow and don't care about anything. Now it is: Busy with production, day and night, cultural learning closely follows; reading sounds all along the river, the bow and cabin become classrooms.

In order to strengthen the guidance of learning and ensure the quality of learning, the station has set up guidance stations in major ports with more ships entering and leaving and longer berthing times, and guidance ships have been set up with the fleet as a unit. Each guidance station and guidance ship is equipped with part-time teachers or counselors. On land, as soon as the boat docks, the counselor of the guidance station goes to the boat to check and arrange learning, and help solve the difficulties in learning; on the boat, when employees encounter difficult problems in learning, they go to the boat with the red flag of "Cultural Guidance Ship" to find the counselor for guidance. Through these intermediate links, the spare-time school for employees can maintain close contact with the various learning groups, and the "water," "land," "point," and "line" can be organically combined, so that wherever production goes, there is a school; wherever the workers go, there is teaching.

The shipping station has also established a set of serious systems suitable for the characteristics of learning on the water. For example, as soon as a boat enters the port, the dispatcher immediately notifies the school so that the school can contact the part-time teacher on the boat in time; when the boat leaves the port, the dispatcher also notifies the school of the departure point and movement of the boat, and the school uses the dispatch board to grasp the flow and distribution of the boat in order to direct the guidance ship to carry out guidance work. In addition, there are voyage learning statistics systems, reward systems, and so on.

The teaching work of the entire shipping station, in addition to two full-time teachers, mainly relies on 98 part-time teachers and part-time counselors. These teachers and counselors are selected from the employees. The leadership seizes all opportunities for winter repairs and flood prevention and boat berthing, and adopts methods such as organizing teachers' professional training, strengthening teachers' professional guidance, and centralized training to regularly train and educate them.

In the case of the rapid development of the shipping industry, it is necessary to quickly improve the technical level of employees and raise the existing employees with less than elementary school level to above elementary school level. On the one hand, the shipping station leadership organized the existing foremen, helmsmen, and junior high school students to study in junior technical classes; on the other hand, based on the principle of high speed and high standards, they adopted the method of combining leaders, teachers, and workers to carry out the teaching reform of accelerated elementary school. In the textbook reform, they mastered the self-compiled textbooks, and the content of the textbooks was closely linked to the actual shipping production and the ideological and living reality of the employees, as well as the combination of politics, culture, and technology, and the combination of geography, history, and nature. At present, the entire shipping station has compiled 54 Chinese language lessons and a set of mathematics textbooks. In the compilation, the workers made many suggestions and actively provided information. Such as: how to learn to calculate ton-kilometers, the flow rate and flow of water, and the speed of the wheel. Because the textbooks are widely linked to the actual production, the employees learn very quickly. They said: What is said in the textbooks is what we have seen and thought of, and we will not forget it after learning it. When this set of new textbooks was taken to the experimental class for trial lectures, the first Chinese language book was taught in only 20 hours for 30 lessons, and the effect was very good.

Because the Linqing Shipping Station has persisted in spare-time education year-round, it has comprehensively improved the political, cultural, and technical level of employees and promoted the development of technical innovation and technical revolution movements. In the first quarter of this year, the employees broke the conventional winter suspension of navigation in the history of shipping and implemented icebreaking transportation and ice transportation. Around the requirements of ship navigation towing and wharf loading and unloading mechanization, the employees put forward more than 1,000 rationalization proposals and cooperated with relevant units to create more than 20 kinds of new machines, such as cranes, electric conveyors, hand-cranked conveyors, anchor machines, and cabin exit machines; together with many reforms in the past, they have basically realized the mechanization and semi-mechanization of wharf loading and unloading, from the past two days of loading and three days of unloading to two hours of loading and three hours of unloading.

    运河到处是课堂
    ——临清航运站常年坚持业余教育
    本报记者　刘关权
    披星戴月生产忙　文化学习紧跟上  河道一片读书声　船头船舱当课堂
    滚滚卫运河，处处是课堂，山东省临清航运站所属船队在一千多公里长的航线上，采用船船配教师、队、站设辅导员等灵活多样的办法，四年如一日地坚持职工业余教育，成为在极端分散流动情况下高速度发展职工业余教育、培养技术人才的一面旗帜。这个单位在去年年底全部扫除了文盲，已普及了业余高小教育，并且有一百四十六人升入初中学习。
    临清航运站管理的船只很多，有八百多名职工。船队不分昼夜航行在北至天津、南至新乡、中经八十多个大小码头的卫运河上，运输任务重，生产季节性强，突击性大。职工多数来自沿岸农村，老船工多，80％是文盲。这些都给职工教育带来了特殊的困难，教学形式、教学时间和教师配备问题都不易解决。但航运站的党支部坚决依靠群众，几年来终于摸索出了一套适合于本身特点的坚持职工业余教育的办法。
    这个航运站根据单船生产，人员分散和程度不齐等情况，确定以单船学习小组为基本学习形式。全航运站共建立了九十一个学习小组。每个小组除由船长具体领导学习外，并推选一个文化水平较高的人任学习组长和兼职教师，同时发动识字的教不识字的，识字多的教识字少的，开展互教互学运动。但他们也不放松班级教学的机会。每到河水封冰、冬季检修、汛期水涨等季节和生产的“背月”，就组织职工集中学习。
    在学习时间上，这个船队随着季节、气候、生产任务的变化，机动灵活地采取了多种办法。这就是：水浅守杆抢着学，等装待卸抓紧学，跑风摇橹换班学，守风守雨整日学，冬修防汛集中学。由于分秒必争，忙里找闲，职工每周可以保持七至八小时的学习时间，全年学习约在三百四十小时左右。从而使职工养成了不择条件、不择地点、随船学、沿河学的良好习惯。没有开展文化学习前，工人说：白天黑夜扛纤板，船到码头心舒坦；四两老酒喝下肚，船头一躺啥不管。现在则是：披星戴月生产忙，文化学习紧跟上；河道一片读书声，船头船舱当课堂。
    为了加强对学习的辅导，保证学习质量，这个站在进出船只较多和停泊时间较长的主要港口设立了辅导站，以船队为单位设立了辅导船。每个辅导站和辅导船都配有兼职教师或辅导员。在陆地，船一靠岸，辅导站的辅导员就到船上检查布置学习，帮助解决学习中的困难；在船上，职工学习遇到疑难问题，就到挂有“文化辅导船”红旗的船上，找辅导员加以指导。通过这些中间环节，就可以使职工业余学校同各个学习小组保持密切的联系，就可以使“水”“陆”“点”“线”有机地结合起来，做到了生产到哪里，哪里是学校；工人到哪里，哪里把书教。
    这个航运站还建立了一套严重的适合水上学习特点的制度。如船一进港，调度人员就立即通知校部，以便校部与船上兼职教师及时取得联系；船只出港时，调度员同样将船只出发地点及动向通知校部，校部利用调度牌掌握船只流动和分布情况，以便指挥辅导船进行辅导工作。此外，还有航次学习统计制度、奖励制度等等。
    全航运站的教学工作，除两名专职教师外，主要是依靠九十八名兼职教师和兼职辅导员。这些教师和辅导员都是从职工中选拔出来的。领导上抓紧冬修防汛和船只停泊的一切机会，采用组织教师业务进修、加强教师业务辅导、集中训练等办法，经常对他们进行培养教育。
    在航运事业飞跃发展的情况下，需要尽快地提高职工技术水平，并将现有不够高小程度的职工提高到高小以上水平。航运站领导上一方面将现有头工、舵工和初中程度的学员组织到初级技术班学习；一面本着高速度、高标准的原则，采用领导、教师、工人三结合的方法，进行速成高小的教学改革。在教材改革中，他们掌握以自编为主，教材内容紧密联系航运生产实际和职工的思想、生活实际及成人的特点，并且政治、文化、技术三者相结合，地理、历史、自然三结合。现在，全航运站已编出五十四课语文和一套数学教材。在编写中，工人曾提出许多建议，并积极提供资料。如：如何学会计算吨公里，水的流速、流量和轮船的转速等等。因为教材广泛联系生产实际，职工学得很快。他们说：课本上讲的，都是我们见到和想到的，学了有用忘不了。这套新教材拿到试验班试讲，第一册语文只用二十个小时就讲了三十课，效果很好。
    由于临清航运站常年坚持业余教育，全面提高了职工的政治、文化、技术水平，促进了技术革新、技术革命运动的发展。今年第一季度，职工们打破了航运史上冬季停航的常规，实行破冰运输和冰上运输。职工们围绕船只航行拖带化、码头装卸机械化的要求，提出一千多条合理化建议，并与有关单位协作，创制起重机、电动输送带、手摇输送带、打锚机、出舱机等二十多种新机具；连同过去的许多改革，已基本上实现了码头装卸机械化、半机械化，由过去的装两天、卸三天，提高到装两小时、卸三小时。
