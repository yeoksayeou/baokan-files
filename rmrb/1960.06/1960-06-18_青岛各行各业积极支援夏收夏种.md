In the Days of Summer Harvest and Planting

    Qingdao Various Industries Actively Support the Summer Harvest and Planting
    Various industries in Qingdao are actively supporting agricultural summer production.
    On the industrial front, workers throughout the city are working day and night to rush-produce tools for the summer harvest and planting. According to statistics from over ninety factories alone, more than 27,000 units of wheat rapid harvesters, more than 700 harvesters, and more than 40,000 sickles have been manufactured. Qingdao Handicraft Industry Bureau's First Machinery Factory lacked technical equipment, so it vigorously carried out communist collaboration, striving for support from units such as the Textile Machinery Factory and the Steam Turbine Factory; if raw materials were insufficient or the variety of specifications was incomplete, the sales personnel tried every means to "find rice to cook," and exchanged what they had with related units, quickly solving the problem of thirty-eight kinds of raw materials. As a result, the production task of 500 threshing machines was completed one month and five days ahead of schedule. Qingdao Vehicle Factory organized various forms of skill competitions and counterpart competitions, vigorously carried out technical revolution, completed 2,650 wheat harvesters, and supplied them to meet the needs of the summer harvest in a timely manner.
    Staff members in finance, trade, and transportation departments also regard supporting summer production as an important current task. In addition to helping industrial departments solve the difficulty of using materials for rushing to produce summer harvest and planting machinery, the commercial departments have also widely carried out delivery activities, delivering the summer harvest and planting materials produced by the industrial departments to the grassroots supply units and user units in a timely manner. According to statistics from various counties (districts) directly under the city, the main materials that have been directly delivered to the production teams include more than 1,300 tons of chemical fertilizers, more than 12,000 harvesters, and more than 35,000 pieces of various small farm tools.

    青岛各行各业积极支援夏收夏种
    青岛市各行各业积极支援农业夏季生产。
    在工业战线上，全市职工正日夜赶制夏收夏种工具。仅据九十多个工厂的统计，已造出小麦快速收割器两万七千多部，收割机七百多台，镰刀四万多把。青岛手工业管理局第一机械厂技术设备不足，便大搞共产主义协作，争取纺织机械厂、汽轮机厂等单位支援；原料不足、品种规格不全，供销人员便千方百计“找米下锅”，与有关单位互通有无，很快地解决了三十八种原料。结果，提前一个月零五天完成了五百台脱谷机的生产任务。青岛车辆厂组织各种形式的对手赛、对口赛，大搞技术革命，完成了两千六百五十台小麦收割机，及时供应了夏收需要。
    财贸、交通运输等部门职工，也把支援夏季生产作为当前的重要任务。商业部门除帮助工业部门解决突击夏收夏种机具的用料困难外，还广泛开展了送货活动，将工业部门生产的夏收夏种物资及时送到基层供应单位和使用单位。仅据市属各县（区）统计，已经直接送货到生产队的主要物资有化肥一千三百多吨，收割器一万二千多部，各种小农具三万五千多件。
