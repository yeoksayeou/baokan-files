    美国侵略军怙恶不悛
    又开枪屠杀南朝鲜人民
    新华社平壤11日电　汉城消息：侵占南朝鲜的美国军队最近又开枪杀死了一名南朝鲜青年和打伤一名南朝鲜妇女。
    据报道，9日，在汉城附近永登浦，有三名南朝鲜人路过一辆美国陆军卡车的旁边，美国士兵艾伦·柯蒂斯凶恶地向他们开了枪。结果南朝鲜青年金显植（译音）被打死了。
    另据报道，4日这天，当几个南朝鲜人路过美国骑兵第一师第八工兵营C连的桥梁工地附近时，美国上等兵利贝里克向他们喊叫，他们没有作声。这个美国兵竟向其中的一个妇女朴希姬（译音）连开两枪，打伤了她。
    据不完全统计，从今年1月初到现在，强占在南朝鲜的美国侵略军直接残害南朝鲜居民的暴行已达十五起，有六十九名南朝鲜青年、儿童和妇女死亡或受了伤。
