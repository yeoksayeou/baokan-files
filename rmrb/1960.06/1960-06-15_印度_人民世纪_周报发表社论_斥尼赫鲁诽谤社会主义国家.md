Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 12th. The Indian Urdu-language weekly "People's Century" published an editorial today refuting Nehru's claim that socialist countries would become "aggressors."

The editorial pointed out that whenever Afro-Asian countries have suffered imperialist aggression, it is the socialist countries, headed by the Soviet Union, that have helped them. If the imperialists are running into snags today despite recklessly carrying out aggression, is this not due to the strength of the socialist camp? Is it not due to its great peaceful nature and dedication to freedom?

The editorial stated, "We believe that Nehru has made a grave mistake in placing the imperialist bloc and the socialist camp on an equal footing."

Refuting Nehru's remarks attacking China for "aggression" against India regarding the Sino-Indian border dispute, the editorial said, we certainly do not believe that this dispute is an attack by an "imperialist country" or an "aggressor country" on another country.

The editorial pointed out that less than a year ago, Nehru himself stated in Parliament that the disputed area in Ladakh was problematic. No definitive conclusions could be drawn regarding the aforementioned area. He and Defense Minister Menon said at the time that the border dispute could not be described as Chinese aggression.

The editorial said that it is possible for two newly independent neighboring countries to have disputes over an undefined border. To doubt the socialist nature of China because of this dispute, and to say that the entire socialist camp might engage in "aggression," is ideologically impossible, and in terms of the development of events, is wrong and unfounded.

The editorial said that since Nehru was able to make erroneous and inappropriate attacks on the Communist Party in order to subvert the former Communist-led government of Kerala, why wouldn't he do the same today? However, such remarks do not enhance Nehru's reputation.

### 印度“人民世纪”周报发表社论  斥尼赫鲁诽谤社会主义国家

    印度“人民世纪”周报发表社论
    斥尼赫鲁诽谤社会主义国家
    新华社新德里12日电　今天出版的一期印度乌尔都文“人民世纪”周报发表社论，驳斥尼赫鲁所谓社会主义国家会成为“侵略者”的说法。
    社论指出，每当亚非国家遭受帝国主义侵略的时候，帮助亚非国家的正是以苏联为首的社会主义国家。如果说，帝国主义者今天肆意进行侵略而碰了壁，这难道不是由于社会主义阵营的力量么？不是由于它的伟大的和平性质并致力于自由么？
    社论说，“我们认为，尼赫鲁把帝国主义集团和社会主义阵营置于同等地位，是犯了很大的错误。”
    社论在驳斥尼赫鲁就印中边界争端攻击中国“侵略”印度的言论时说，我们当然不认为，这种争端是一个“帝国主义国家”或“侵略国家”对另一国家的进攻。
    社论指出，在不满一年的时间以前，尼赫鲁在议会中发言时曾亲口说，在拉达克发生争议的地区是有问题的。对于上述地区是不能下断语的。他和国防部长梅农在当时说，不能把边境争执说成是中国侵略。
    社论说，两个新独立的邻国对于没有划定的边界发生争端是可能的。由于这种争端，怀疑中国的社会主义的性质，说什么整个社会主义阵营可能进行“侵略”，这从意识形态上说是不可能的，而就事件的发展来说是错误的和没有根据的。
    社论说，尼赫鲁既然为了颠复喀拉拉邦的前共产党领导的政府而能对共产党进行错误的和不合时宜的攻击，那么他为什么不会在今天也这样干呢？可是这种言论不能增添尼赫鲁的声誉。
