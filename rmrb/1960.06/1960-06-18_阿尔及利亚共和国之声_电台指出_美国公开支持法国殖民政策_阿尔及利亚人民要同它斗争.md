Xinhua News Agency, Cairo - The "Voice of the Republic of Algeria" radio station here published a commentary on the 13th condemning the U.S. government for giving military aid to France and supporting De Gaulle's imperialist policies in Algeria.

The radio station said that the United States openly colludes with France to oppose our liberation struggle, which means that from now on, we must fight against another imperialist force - the United States. U.S. imperialism should fully understand that no force can influence our determination, and no force on earth can prevent Africans from moving towards freedom and independence.

The radio station said that from the first day of the revolution, we knew that the United States was France's partner in the war against Algerians, colluding with France behind the scenes. The radio station pointed out that now the U.S. government has further nakedly exposed its imperialist nature, exposing the hypocrisy of its so-called "freedom" and "democracy."

The radio station said that the U.S. government's aim is to make De Gaulle dependent on American policies and viewpoints on international issues, but the United States should understand that its attempt to support French imperialism against African freedom and independence is tantamount to trying to resurrect a corpse. Because the era of imperialist rule in Africa has passed, and now is the era of moving towards freedom. The radio station also said that even if the United States mobilizes all its troops, it cannot change the progress of history, because the progress of history is stronger than armies and fleets. The fate of Africa will be decided by the Africans themselves, not by De Gaulle or Eisenhower.

    “阿尔及利亚共和国之声”电台指出
    美国公开支持法国殖民政策  阿尔及利亚人民要同它斗争
    据新华社开罗电　这里的“阿尔及利亚共和国之声电台”13日发表评论谴责美国政府给予法国军事援助和支持戴高乐在阿尔及利亚的帝国主义政策。
    电台说，美国公开同法国进行勾结来反对我们的解放斗争，这表示，我们从现在起，要同另一个帝国主义势力——美国进行斗争。美帝国主义应该完全明白，任何力量都不能影响我们的决心，地球上没有任何力量能够阻挠非洲人走向自由和独立。
    电台说，我们从革命第一天起，就知道在法国进行的反对阿尔及利亚人的战争中美国是法国的伙伴，在幕后同法国勾结在一起。电台指出，现在美国政府更进一步赤裸裸地暴露了它的帝国主义本质，暴露了它所谓“自由”和“民主”的虚伪性。
    电台说，美国政府的目的是要使戴高乐在国际问题上依附美国的政策和观点，但是，美国应该明白，它想支持法帝国主义来反对非洲的自由和独立就等于是想使僵尸复活。因为帝国主义统治非洲的时代已经过去了，现在是向自由前进的时代。电台又说，即使美国动员它的全部军队，也不能改变历史的前进，因为历史的前进要比军队和舰队更强大。非洲的命运将要由非洲人自己来决定，而不是由戴高乐或艾森豪威尔来决定。
