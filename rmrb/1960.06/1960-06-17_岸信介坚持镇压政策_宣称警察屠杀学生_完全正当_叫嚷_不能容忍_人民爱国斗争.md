Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 16th: Despite the strong protests of the Japanese people, the Kishi Nobusuke traitorous government of Japan, after dispatching armed police and instigating fascist thugs to brutally murder patriotic demonstrators last night, actually issued a statement this morning declaring that it would continue to suppress the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people against the United States and against Kishi, and shouted that "such actions must not be tolerated."

The Kishi Nobusuke government, after holding a meeting for an hour and a half, issued a statement that said barbarously, "The measures taken by the public security authorities (last night) against the students were completely justified."

The Kishi Nobusuke government, which has fallen into a dead end, in its statement also used all the despicable means commonly used by all reactionaries, insisting that the patriotic demonstration held by Japanese students yesterday was a "meticulously planned action instigated by international communism," in an attempt to create an excuse for future large-scale repression of the Japanese people. This traitorous government, which killed and injured hundreds of people yesterday, also shouted that it "will never succumb to violent actions" and that it will "eliminate various kinds of violent actions."

    岸信介坚持镇压政策
    宣称警察屠杀学生“完全正当”
    叫嚷“不能容忍”人民爱国斗争
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：日本岸信介卖国政府不顾日本人民的强烈抗议，在昨天夜里出动武装警察和唆使法西斯暴徒残杀爱国示威者以后，竟然又在今天凌晨发表声明，宣称要继续镇压日本人民反美反岸的爱国正义斗争，叫嚷“决不能容忍这种行动”。
    岸信介政府在举行了一个半小时会议后发表的声明蛮横地说，“治安当局（昨夜）对学生采取的措施是完全正当的”。
    陷于穷途末路的岸信介政府在声明中又采用了一切反动派贯用的卑劣手段，硬说日本学生昨天举行的爱国示威是什么“国际共产主义所煽动的策划周密的行动”，企图为今后对日本人民的大规模镇压制造借口。这个在昨天打死和打伤了数百人的卖国政府还叫嚷“决不对暴力行动屈服”，而且要“消灭多种多样的暴力行动”。
