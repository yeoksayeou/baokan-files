Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 5th: The general strike of 5.6 million Japanese workers on June 4th against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty was unprecedented in the history of the Japanese labor movement in terms of its scale and strength. This general strike dealt a heavy blow to the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, powerfully promoted the struggle against the U.S.-Japan military treaty, strengthened the ranks of the anti-American and anti-Kishi patriotic struggle, and deepened the crisis of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet.

The June 4th general strike erupted under the Kishi Nobusuke traitorous clique's blatant disregard for the Japanese people's strong demands for the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet to resign, dissolve the Diet, abolish the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and cancel Eisenhower's visit to Japan. At the same time, the recent rude remarks of the U.S. Ambassador to Japan to Asanuma, the leader of the Japan Socialist Party, and the U.S. Embassy's public statement interfering in Japan's internal affairs, also angered the Japanese people. Consequently, their anti-imperialist sentiment became stronger, and the call to oppose Eisenhower's visit to Japan grew even louder.

This general strike by Japanese workers received support from all walks of life. Not only workers participated in the unified struggle, but also people from a wide range of social strata. The solidarity between the working class and other strata of the people has been further strengthened.

Among the demonstrators who surrounded the Diet Building on the afternoon and evening of the 4th, there were many workers who were not members of trade union organizations and basic members of the right-wing All Japan Trade Union Congress. There were also employees from large trading companies such as Itochu Corporation and Nissho Corporation. Employees from eighteen trading companies specializing in trade with China also participated in the strike that day and joined the demonstrations around the Diet. A large number of midwives, pastors, and various merchants voluntarily joined the ranks of supporting the workers' strike. Even restaurant employees and barbers, who had never participated in anti-government struggles in the past, participated in mass demonstrations against the government for the first time yesterday. The demonstration held outside the Diet on the 4th was very broadly representative compared to the previous demonstrations mostly composed of workers.

The June 4th unified struggle also showed that the Japanese people's struggle is increasingly directed at U.S. imperialism. Yesterday, after 200,000 people demonstrated outside the Diet, most of them went to demonstrate at the U.S. Embassy, chanting slogans outside the embassy such as: "U.S. troops get out of Japan!" "Yankees go home!" "Ike don't come!" "Withdraw U-2 Black Jet Aircraft from Japan!" "Americans leave Asia!"

Approximately 8,000 professors and students held an hour-long sit-in demonstration in front of the U.S. Embassy. In addition, in many places, slogans against U.S. imperialism and its running dog, Kishi Nobusuke, could be seen: "Don't let Ike come to Japan!" "I'm waiting for you in Hawaii—Syngman Rhee's message to Kishi Nobusuke."

The powerful June 4th general strike and unified action forced the Kishi Nobusuke clique into an even more difficult situation. All the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet's conspiracies to sabotage the strike and unified action failed. The Kishi Nobusuke clique has no way to escape the deepening crisis it faces. Due to the opposition of opposition parties such as the Socialist Party, the Japanese Communist Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, and some people in the conservative parties, the Kishi Nobusuke clique's conspiracy to deliberate the new "Security Treaty" in the House of Councillors has not yet succeeded.

Kishi Nobusuke regards the U.S. President's visit to Japan on the 19th as his only backer, but the Japanese people's struggle against Eisenhower's visit to Japan is rapidly rising. Even within the Liberal Democratic Party and among monopoly capitalists, some people, fearing trouble, openly expressed their opposition to the U.S. President's activities in Japan, or suggested that Eisenhower postpone his visit to Japan.

The victory of the June 4th general strike and unified action further strengthened the Japanese people's confidence in winning the struggle. Encouraged by this victory, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) plans to hold mass rallies across the country on the 11th, larger in scale than the "May Day" International Labor Day, and launch another large-scale strike on the 17th or 18th.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 5th: Shiga Yoshio, a member of the House of Representatives of the Japanese Communist Party, said on the evening of the 4th that the great victory of the general strike held by Japanese workers on June 4th encouraged the Japanese people and strengthened their confidence in achieving final victory.

He said in a statement to reporters,
	The struggle on June 4th proved that the fighting strength of the Japanese people has developed to such a huge extent that the old estimates should now be abandoned.

Shiga Yoshio said that efforts should be intensified in the future to carry out the anti-U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" movement among a wider range of the masses, especially among rural residents.

He emphasized that workers should defeat all the conspiracies of the Kishi Nobusuke government to retaliate against those who participated in the general strike. "At the same time, there should be more forceful protests against Eisenhower's planned visit to Japan and the U-2 jet plane stationed in Japan."

Yokoo Setsuo, a member of the Diet of the Japan Socialist Party, said that since the national unified action on May 26th, the upsurge of the struggle on June 4th was an "amazing development."

He emphasized that if the people's struggle is to fully achieve its goals, then Kishi Nobusuke must be further attacked. He pointed out, "We must organize a larger-scale struggle again targeting Eisenhower's visit to Japan."

Earlier, former Socialist Party Chairman Suzuki Mosaburo emphasized that for those who understand the situation of Japanese workers when the U.S. occupation authorities banned the general strike from being held on February 1, 1947, thirteen years ago, the victory of the June 4th strike is particularly moving. Suzuki said, "The victory of such a general strike seen this morning was unimaginable at that time. This shows that the people have grown into an irresistible force in Japan." Suzuki continued, "On the morning of the 4th, close cooperation was established between striking workers, workers supporting the strike, and ordinary citizens." "This unity arises from the common anger of people of all strata towards Kishi Nobusuke."

Suzuki also said, "Prime Minister Kishi once told me that he has always been afraid of people's demonstrations. I am convinced that Kishi Nobusuke must be terrified after learning that today's demonstration has received such full support from the people." A spokesman for "Sohyo" pointed out that all workers cooperated very well on June 4th. He announced that all workers are now preparing to hold a larger-scale general strike.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 5th: The Japanese "National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty" decided today on a future action plan, stipulating to launch a more powerful struggle, including a general strike, against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, demanding the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet.

The plan stipulates that the 18th national unified action will be launched from the 11th to the 19th; and the second national general strike will be launched from the 15th to the 17th, and a mass movement protesting the U.S. President's visit to Japan will be launched on the 19th.

According to the plan, the National Conference will hold a mass rally in Tokyo around the 11th with 200,000 participants including local representatives and people from all walks of life to prevent the ratification of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," demand the dissolution of the Diet, overthrow the Kishi cabinet, safeguard democracy, and oppose the U.S. President's visit to Japan. After the meeting, all participants will protest at the U.S. Embassy.

The plan stipulates that when U.S. Presidential Press Secretary Hagerty comes to Japan on the 10th, the masses will be mobilized to launch a movement against the U.S. President's visit to Japan, and representatives will be sent to meet with Hagerty to express their will.

The action plan also stipulates that from the 12th to the 14th, the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, trade unions, and mass organizations from all walks of life will use all their strength to go to the streets or visit door-to-door to collect signatures aimed at half of the voters (27 million) against the ratification of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, demanding the resignation of the Kishi cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet.

The National Conference also decided that in the future, it is necessary to strengthen the movement against the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" among farmers across the country and actively call on farmers to participate in the struggle. (Attached pictures)

### 壮大斗争力量　推动反美反岸斗争　加深岸内阁危机  日本总罢工胜利大大鼓舞人民斗志  “国民会议”将继续组织罢工示威反对日美条约和艾森豪威尔访日

    壮大斗争力量　推动反美反岸斗争　加深岸内阁危机
    日本总罢工胜利大大鼓舞人民斗志
    “国民会议”将继续组织罢工示威反对日美条约和艾森豪威尔访日
    新华社5日讯　东京消息：日本五百六十万工人在6月4日举行的反对日美军事同盟条约的总罢工，就其规模和力量来说是日本劳工运动史上空前未有的。这次总罢工沉重地打击了美日反动派，有力地推动了反对日美军事条约的斗争，壮大了反美反岸爱国斗争的队伍，加深了岸信介内阁的危机。
    六·四总罢工是在岸信介卖国集团公然蔑视日本人民要求岸信介内阁辞职、解散议会、废除新日美“安全条约”并取消艾森豪威尔对日本的访问的强烈呼声下爆发的。同时，美国驻日本大使最近对日本社会党领袖浅沼的蛮横谈话和美国大使馆发表的公开干涉日本内政的声明，也激怒了日本人民，因而，他们反对美帝国主义的情绪更加强烈，反对艾森豪威尔访问日本的呼声更加高涨。
    日本工人这次总罢工得到了各界人士的支持，参加统一斗争的不仅有工人，还有广泛阶层的人民。工人阶级同其它阶层人民的团结进一步加强了。
    在4日下午和晚间包围国会大厦的示威者当中，有许多是未参加工会组织的工人和右翼工会全日本工会会议的基础会员。其中还有伊藤忠商事公司和日商公司这样一些大贸易公司的职员。专门同中国做买卖的十八家贸易公司的职员也参加了这一天的罢工，并且参加了国会周围的示威。大批助产士、牧师和各种商人自动地参加了支持工人罢工的行列。连过去从来不参加反对政府斗争的饭馆雇员和理发师昨天也第一次参加了反对政府的群众示威。4日在国会外面举行的示威同过去几次大部分由工人组成的示威相比，代表性非常广泛。
    六·四统一斗争还表明，日本人民的斗争越来越指向美帝国主义。昨天，二十万群众在国会外面示威以后，大多数都到美国大使馆示威，在使馆外面高呼：“美国军队滚出日本！”“美国佬滚回家去！”“艾克不要来！”“把U—2型黑色喷气飞机撤出日本！”“美国人离开亚洲！”等鲜明的口号。
    大约有八千名教授和学生在美国大使馆门前举行了一小时静坐示威。此外，在许多地方，还可以看到反对美帝国主义及其走狗岸信介的标语：“不让艾克来日本！”“我在夏威夷等着你——李承晚寄语岸信介”。
    强大的六·四总罢工和统一行动迫使岸信介集团更加陷入困境。岸信介内阁破坏罢工和统一行动的一切阴谋都失败了。岸信介集团已经没有办法摆脱它面临的日益加深的危机。由于社会党、日本共产党、民主社会党等在野党和保守政党中的一些人的反对，岸信介集团在参议院审议新“安全条约”的阴谋至今尚未得逞。
    岸信介把美国总统19日到日本的访问当做是他的唯一靠山，但是日本人民反对艾森豪威尔访问日本的斗争正在迅速高涨。甚至在自由民主党内部和垄断资本家当中也有一部分人由于担心出事，公开表示反对美国总统到日本活动，或出主意要艾森豪威尔推迟访问日本。
    六·四总罢工和统一行动的胜利使日本人民进一步坚定了争取斗争胜利的信心。受到这次胜利的鼓舞，日本工会总评议会计划在11日在全国各地举行比“五一”国际劳动节规模更大的群众大会，并在17日或18日再次展开声势浩大的罢工。
    据新华社5日讯　东京消息：日本共产党众议院议员志贺义雄4日晚间说，日本工人6月4日举行的总罢工的巨大胜利鼓舞了日本人民，加强了他们对取得最后胜利的信心。
    他对新闻记者发表谈话时说，
  6月4日的斗争证明，日本人民的战斗力量已经发展到这样巨大程度，现在应该抛弃旧的估计了。
    志贺义雄说，今后应该加紧努力在更广泛的人民群众中间，特别是在农村居民中间，开展反对日美“安全条约”运动。
    他强调指出，工人们应该击败岸信介政府企图对参加总罢工的人进行报复性打击的一切阴谋。“同时，应该更有力地抗议艾森豪威尔计划对日本的访问和U—2型喷气机驻在日本”。
    日本社会党国会议员横路节雄说，自从5月26日的全国统一行动以来，6月4日的斗争又有这样的高涨，这是“惊人的发展”。
    他强调指出，如果人民斗争要完全实现它的目标的话，那么必须进一步打击岸信介。他指出，“我们必须针对艾森豪威尔对日本的访问再次组织规模更大的斗争”。
    早些时候，前社会党委员长铃木茂三郎强调说，对于了解十三年前美国占领军当局禁止在1947年2月1日举行总罢工那时候日本工人的情况的人，6月4日罢工的胜利，是特别令人感动的。铃木说，“今天上午看到的这种总罢工胜利在当时是不能设想的。这说明，人民已经成长为日本的一支不可抗拒的力量”。铃木继续说，4日上午，罢工的工人，支援罢工的工人和一般市民之间建立了密切的合作。“这种团结产生于各阶层人民对岸信介共同的愤怒”。
    铃木还说，“岸首相曾经对我说过，他一直害怕人民示威。我深信，岸信介在知道今天的示威得到人民这样充分的支持后，一定吓坏了。”“总评”的一位发言人指出，所有的工人在6月4日进行了十分良好的合作。他宣布，所有工人现在正准备举行更大规模的总罢工。
    新华社5日讯　东京消息：日本“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”今天决定了今后的行动计划，规定要展开包括总罢工在内的更强大的斗争，反对日美军事同盟条约，要求岸信介内阁辞职和解散国会。
    计划规定，将在11日到19日期间展开第十八次全国统一行动；并且在15日至17日期间展开第二次全国性总罢工，19日展开抗议美国总统访日的群众运动。
    根据计划，国民会议将在11日前后在东京举行有地方代表和各阶层人民二十万人参加的阻止批准新日美“安全条约”、要求解散国会、打倒岸内阁、维护民主、反对美国总统访日的群众大会。会后，全体与会者将到美国大使馆进行抗议。
    计划规定，将在10日美国总统新闻秘书哈格蒂前来日本时，动员群众展开反对美国总统访日的运动，并将派遣代表会见哈格蒂，表达他们的意志。
    行动计划还规定，从12日到14日，社会党、共产党、工会和各界群众团体将以全部力量到街上或通过挨户访问方式，征集以选民的一半（二千七百万人）为目标的反对批准日美军事同盟条约、要求岸内阁下台和解散国会的签名。
    国民会议还决定，今后要在全国各地农民中间加强反对新日美“安全条约”的运动，积极地号召农民参加斗争。（附图片）
