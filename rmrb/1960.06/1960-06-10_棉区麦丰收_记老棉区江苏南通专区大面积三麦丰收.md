    Wheat Bumper Harvest in Cotton-Growing Areas
    A Record of Large-Scale Wheat Bumper Harvest in Nantong Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, a Traditional Cotton-Growing Area
    Nantong Regional Correspondents Collective Writing
    Entering Nantong Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, renowned as a traditional cotton-growing area, this year presents a different scene: looking down, cotton seedlings are verdant; looking up, wheat fields ripple like waves. On this vast Jianghai plain, five million mu of wheat fields weave into a golden ocean across the entire region.

    Wheat Fragrance Added to Silver Flower Land
    One clear morning, we arrived at Yinyang Commune in Qidong County, a cotton reclamation area. At a glance, the boundless ocean outside the dikes stirred up silvery white waves; inside the dikes, golden wheat swayed, with rows of tender green cotton seedlings interspersed between the wheat rows. Members of the Ninth Brigade swung their sickles, vigorously cutting the thick, dense wheat stalks; young women hooked the sickle handles with their hands, swinging the blades downward as if cutting reeds. It turned out that many of them were using sickles to cut wheat for the first time. Some couldn't help but sing: In previous years, only green was seen at this time, with only cotton and no wheat; this year, yellow and green mingle, with wheat ripening before the silver flowers bloom.

    These commune members who have grown cotton for generations have cultivated such good wheat this year. How much hard work have they put in!

    In February, the lush green wheat seedlings grew to be more than two inches tall. After several consecutive spring rains, the sandy soil became compacted, and the wheat roots grew outwards from the soil like "claws." At that time, the higher authorities called for deepening the inter-tillage, but no one had ever done this work before. Production Team Leader Gu Shirong rushed to Huilong Commune, fifty li away, to gain "experience." As soon as he returned home, he took his tools to the fields to demonstrate. Wang Fengying, Zhu Xiuqin, and more than a dozen women followed the team leader's movements, using small rakes to loosen the soil two inches deep in the gaps an inch away from the wheat rows, then using an "iron drag" to break up the loosened soil and smooth it out. Following their movements, they scattered the fine soil onto the wheat rows to mound the roots. The wheat rows were as smooth as a tabletop, with not a single lump of soil the size of an egg to be found. No matter how Team Leader Gu scrutinized it, he couldn't find any fault, and he finally raised his thumb in satisfaction, praising repeatedly, "Qualified, qualified!" The example of Yinyang Commune's Sixth Production Team managing wheat seedlings with embroidery-like care is just one of thousands of examples. The people of the entire prefecture have been meticulously managing the wheat from planting to maturity.

    In the autumn of 1959, the Nantong Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the policy of taking grain as the key link and making overall arrangements, loudly put forward the slogan of "Guaranteeing that the cotton fields are not reduced, and striving to have a grain surplus in 1960." This slogan, like a battle drum, awakened people's thinking. From cotton-growing areas to grain-producing areas, from fishing areas to special economic crop areas, a mass ideological debate with grain as the key link was launched. People debated from day to night, from the fields to the canteens... In this way, the old convention of emphasizing cotton and neglecting grain that had existed for many years was thoroughly broken. Not only did the cotton-growing areas within the embankments further expand the wheat planting area, but wheat was also planted on the seaside, wasteland, and alkaline land, in cotton reclamation areas, fishing areas, at threshing grounds, by roadsides, and on all land where wheat could be grown. The wheat area in the entire prefecture was expanded by more than one million mu compared to last year.

    Distant Fields Catch Up with Near Fields
    Before the Spring Festival, the wheat seedlings in Chuan'gang Commune, Nantong County, were not growing evenly, especially the wheat seedlings in some distant fields, which were yellow and thin and could not keep up with the near fields.

    One day, Ji Yuan, the First Secretary of the County Party Committee, and Wu Changquan, the First Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, came to the Chuan'dong high-yield area. They went from the near fields to the distant fields, from the edges of the fields to the centers, carefully observing the growth of the wheat seedlings. They found that the wheat seedlings in the near fields were growing well, a lush green, while the wheat seedlings in the distant fields were growing poorly, yellow and thin. The problem was obvious: if the lack of fertilizer in the distant fields was not quickly and thoroughly resolved, it would seriously affect the large-scale balanced increase in production. They immediately invited team cadres, technicians, and experienced farmers to discuss countermeasures in the fields. After everyone contributed ideas and suggestions, it was decided to build manure pits in the fields to regularly ferment and store fertilizer to meet the needs of the distant fields for topdressing.

    After a short half-month of hard work, more than 3,900 field manure pits (one for every twenty mu of land) were built throughout the commune, forming a network of fertilizer pond bases scattered like stars. During the wheat green-up period, all distant and near fields were given sufficient fertilizer, and the wheat greened up half a month earlier than in previous years. The growth of wheat seedlings in the distant fields caught up with that of the near fields. The commune members happily said, "We don't have distant fields here anymore."

    Good Grain Grows on Alkaline Land
    Following the Tongyang Highway northward, we arrived at a place called "Guitou Street" in Zhaoming Commune, Rugao County. This is the famous battlefield of the "Seven Battles, Seven Victories" in the Liberation War. Today, this victorious battlefield, where the flames of war raged fourteen years ago, is a sea of ​​wheat in harvest. Laughter filled the threshing ground, and the threshed wheat straw was piled higher than the eaves of the houses.

    Speaking of Guitou Street, it was a notoriously poor place before liberation. The continuous saline-alkali land and pot-bottom fields were covered with reeds and horsetail grass. After the sun, salt frost appeared in the fields. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the face of nature was continuously changed, and production increased year by year. However, compared with the rich teams, the output was still low, and Guitou Street was still a poor place.

    Poor people have lofty ambitions, and the poorer they are, the more revolutionary they want to be. At the beginning of the autumn sowing, thousands of commune members in this area of ​​eight or nine li stayed in the fields and ate in the fields, declaring war on low-yielding fields. Under the hands of the heroes, pieces of saline-alkali land were generally plowed to a depth of one and a half feet. One plowing, one layer of fertilizer, covering the lower layer with grass pond mud, the middle layer with grass ash, and the uppermost layer with a thin layer of manure. With fertilizer in every layer, how could bad soil not turn into good soil, and how could alkaline land not be greatly improved!

    Looking at the endless golden wheat waves in front of them, the commune members were all exhilarated. They said: "Good grain grows on alkaline and thin fields, which we never dared to imagine since ancient times. The three magic weapons show their power, and the wheat waves are more magnificent than the sea."

    Changing the face of low-yielding areas and low-yielding fields, so that low-yield becomes high-yield and poor teams become rich teams, is an important aspect of the Nantong Prefectural Party Committee's organization of a large-scale balanced and high-yield wheat campaign. Since the autumn sowing last year, various places have launched high-yield areas and command fields in low-yielding areas and low-yielding fields, and high-yield areas of tens of thousands of mu, thousands of mu, and hundreds of mu have appeared everywhere. In this harvest season, good news of low-yield becoming high-yield has spread everywhere. The growth rate of the yield per mu in many low-yielding fields is no longer a few percent or a few tens of percent, but doubles and jumps several times! Nantong people's capture of a wheat bumper harvest is only the beginning of victory. The bugle of a battle to win a comprehensive bumper harvest of autumn-ripening crops has sounded again. They have decided to continue to use and develop the experience of vigorously grasping active and balanced production increase, plant summer crops well, manage autumn-ripening crops well, and strive for a complete victory in the battle for grain self-sufficiency in 1960.

    棉区麦丰收
    记老棉区江苏南通专区大面积三麦丰收
    南通地区通讯员集体采写
    跨进以老棉区著称的江苏南通专区，今年别有一番景象：低头看，棉苗绿茵茵；举目望，麦海浪滔滔。在这千里江海平原上，全区五百万亩三麦织成了金色的海洋。
    银花地上添麦香
    一个晴朗的早晨，我们来到启东县寅阳公社，这里是个棉垦区。一眼望去，堤外无边无际的茫茫海洋，激起了银白色的巨浪；堤内黄澄澄的麦子，金浪滚滚，隐隐地看到间夹在麦耥中间一行一行嫩绿棉苗。第九大队的社员们挥着镰刀，一股劲地割着又粗、又密的麦棵；年青的姑娘们手挽着镰刀柄，刀口向下像砍芦柴似的。原来她们中间许多人还是第一次用镰刀割麦。有些人情不自禁地唱道：往年此时一片绿，只见棉花不见麦；今年此时黄又绿，银花未开麦先熟。
    这些祖祖辈辈种棉花的社员，今年居然培育出如此好的麦子，他们曾经花了多么艰辛的劳动呵！
    2月里，绿油油的麦苗长得二寸多高，连续几场春雨，沙土板结起来了，麦子的根须像“抓扒”似的朝泥土外面长。当时，上级号召加深中耕，可是谁都没有干过这活儿。生产队长顾士荣一气跑到五十里路外的汇龙公社取“经”，一回到家，就拿了工具到田里做样子。王凤英、朱秀琴等十几个妇女学着队长的动作，用小钉耙在离麦行寸把远的空档里，倒深二寸，再用“铁拉”把翻松的泥土敲细拉平，顺着手势，又把拉平的细土撒到麦行里壅根，麦耥平整得像桌面一样，麦行子里找不到一个鸡蛋大的泥块。队长左挑右挑，直到挑不出一点毛病时，才满意地竖起了大姆指，连声称赞说：“够格，够格！”寅阳公社第六生产队社员绣花般地管理麦苗的事例，只不过是千万个事例中的一个，全专区人民都是这样从播种开始，精心地一直管到麦熟。
    1959年秋天，中共南通地委根据以粮为纲、全面安排的方针，响亮地提出了“保证棉田不缩小，力争1960年粮食自给有余”的口号。这口号像战鼓一样，震醒了人们的思想。从棉区到粮区，从渔业区到特种经济作物区，开展了一场全民性的以粮为纲的思想大辩论，人们从白天辩论到深夜，从田头辩论到食堂……，就是这样，把多少年来人们重棉轻粮的老常规被彻底破除了，不仅内圩棉区进一步扩大了三麦播种面积，而且把麦子种到了海边、荒滩、碱地，种到了棉垦区、渔业区，种到了场头、路边，种到了所有一切能够种麦的土地上。全专区三麦面积比去年扩大了上百万亩。
    远田赶近田
    春节之前，南通县川港公社的麦苗长势并不平齐，特别是一部分远田上的麦苗，黄瘦瘦的赶不上近田。
    一天，县委第一书记纪元同志和公社党委第一书记吴长泉同志来到川东丰产片，他们从近田跑到远田，从田边跑到田心，细心察看麦苗的长势，发现近田里的麦苗长得好，一片嫩绿，远田的麦苗长势差，又黄又瘦。问题很明显，如果不迅速彻底解决远田缺肥的问题，就会严重影响大面积平衡增产。他们立即邀请了队干部、技术员和有经验的农民，在田头商量对策。经过大家献计献策，决定建造田头粪池，经常沤肥、储肥，满足远田麦苗追肥的需要。
    经过短短半个月的奋战，全公社造起三千九百多个田头粪池（每二十亩地有一口），形成了一个星罗棋布的肥料塘基地网。麦子返青期间，所有远田和近田一样，都施足了肥料，麦子比往年提早半个月返青，远田上麦苗的长势赶上了近田。社员们快活地说：“我们这里没有远田啦。”
    碱地长好粮
    沿着通扬公路向北，我们来到了如皋县赵明公社名叫“鬼头街”的地方，这里是解放战争中有名的“七战七捷”之一的战地。这个十四年前战火漫天的胜利战场，今天是一片丰收的麦海。打麦场上一片笑声，打完的麦秸，堆得比屋檐还高。
    提起鬼头街，解放前是一个穷得出名的地方，连片的盐碱地、锅底田上，长满了芦柴麦节节草，太阳一晒，田里冒盐霜。解放后，在党的领导下，不断改变了大自然的面貌，年年增产。但是，和富队比较起来，产量还低，鬼头街还是个穷地方。
    人穷志不穷，愈穷愈要革命。秋播一开始，这个方圆八九里的地方，成千的社员，宿在田头，吃在田头，向低产田开火。在英雄们的手下，一片片盐碱地，普遍翻了一尺五寸深。翻一遍，施一层肥，下层铺上草塘泥，中层盖上草木灰，最上层又浇了一次薄粪，层层有肥，孬土怎不变好土，碱地怎不大翻身！
    眼前“鬼头街”这地方，一望无际的金色麦浪，社员们无不欢欣鼓舞。他们说：“碱地薄田长好粮，自古以来不敢想，三大法宝显威力，麦浪滚滚赛海洋。”
    改变低产地区、低产田的面貌，使低产变高产、穷队变富队，是南通专区各级党委组织大抓三麦大面积平衡高产的一个重要方面。去年秋种以来，各地就在低产地区、低产田里大搞丰产片、指挥田，到处出现了成万亩、成千亩、成百亩的低产田丰产片。在这丰收的季节，到处传遍了低产变高产的喜讯。许多低产田的单产量的增长速度，已经不是百分之几、百分之几十，而是成倍地翻，成倍地跳！南通人民夺得麦子丰收，仅仅是胜利的开端。一场夺取秋熟作物全面大丰收的战斗号角又响了。他们决定继续运用和发展大抓积极平衡增产的经验，种好夏种作物，管好秋熟作物，力争1960年粮食自给有余的战斗全胜。
