Review of the Japanese Modern Painting Exhibition and Greetings to Japanese Painters
Ye Qianyu

For the past month, the Japanese people have been opposing the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, opposing Nobusuke Kishi, and opposing Eisenhower's visit to Japan with the force of thunder, forcing the god of war to dare not set foot on Japanese soil. The Japanese people's struggle has disrupted the U.S. imperialists' aggressive陣勢 in Asia and increased the strength of defending peace. We support the Japanese people's struggle with great concern and are jubilant for the Japanese people's victory.

During these days of struggle, the "Japanese Modern Painting Exhibition" opened in Beijing. The enthusiastic opening ceremony was filled with the joy of victory, adding a layer of brilliance to those rich and colorful paintings. Although the content of the works does not directly reflect the struggle life of the Japanese people, the determination and will of Japanese artists to create and defend the national painting tradition are seen from the distinct national style, which is naturally connected with the current struggle.

We know that in addition to political and economic oppression and exploitation, the most vicious trick of imperialist aggression is the destruction of national culture, making the oppressed nations forever slaves of imperialist culture. Since the end of World War II, along with American bayonets and capital, the decadent American way of life has been imported into Japan, causing disasters in Japan. The decadent American culture is of course also part of the American way of life. It is hard to imagine that in the field of painting, it would not be corroded by bacteria such as "decadentism" and "abstractism." Now I am very happy to see the contributions and achievements of Japanese painters in protecting and developing national art.

Japanese painting and Chinese painting have a long history. From the Tang Dynasty to the end of the Qing Dynasty, Chinese painting had a lot of influence on the development of Japanese painting. The most significant traces in the middle are the Buddhist paintings of the Tang Dynasty, the landscape and flower-and-bird paintings of the Song and Yuan Dynasties, and the literati paintings of the Ming and Qing Dynasties. The Japanese painter Sesshu, who was selected as a world cultural celebrity in 1956, is an outstanding representative of the mutual integration of Chinese and Japanese painting art. He accepted the landscape paintings of the Ma Yuan and Xia Gui schools of the Southern Song Dynasty and formed his own unique style, which has been passed down to the later Southern Painting School. Since Japanese society entered capitalism, Japanese painters began to accept influences from Western Europe, which made Japanese painting after the Meiji era form a new style. During the Chinese democratic revolution, under the influence of Japanese painting, the Chinese Lingnan School of painting, represented by the Gao Qifeng and Gao Jianfu brothers, appeared. This mutual influence is beneficial to the development of fine arts in our two countries.

The tools and materials used by Japanese painters are basically the same as those used by Chinese painters. The performance of paper, silk, brushes, and ink is the same, and the coloring with water and glue is also the same. The themes, content, and expression techniques are also similar. For example, Chinese painters have a wide range of interests in the exploration of natural beauty, so they developed landscape and flower-and-bird paintings. Japanese painters also admire nature very much, and there are also more landscape and flower-and-bird paintings. The techniques of line drawing, ink painting, heavy color, outlining, and boneless painting in Chinese painting are also basic techniques of Japanese painting. Japanese painters also regard the system of inscriptions and seals in modern Chinese painting as a component of composition. Despite so many similarities, it does not hinder the development of the national spirit and national characteristics of Japanese painting. The more than 80 works exhibited this time are proof of this.

In this exhibition, the senior painters include Yokoyama Taikan, Kobayashi Kokei, Yasuda Yukihiko, and Maeda Seison of the Japan Art Institute School, Kaburaki Kiyokata and Matsubayashi Keigetsu of the Japan Art Exhibition School, Kawabata Ryushi of the Seiryusha, and the independent Kawai Gyokudo and Kosugi Hoan. The works of the older generation of painters have more distinct traditional characteristics, and the legacy of the old school can still be seen. This type of work reveals a relatively strong romantic color, which is a very valuable element in the Japanese painting tradition. In contrast, the works of the new generation, such as Kawabata Ryushi of the Seiryusha and many rising stars of the New Production Association, have fewer traditional styles in their works and obviously have traces of Western modern schools since the Post-Impressionist period. This trace is mainly manifested in artistic techniques, and a few works are also manifested in themes and content. For example, Ogura Yuki's "Good Night" depicts a nude girl, and Morita Saikai's "Boy" depicts a nude boy playing with three dogs. These images are common in the paintings of European modern schools, but are rare in Japanese paintings.

As mentioned above, Japanese painting and Chinese painting have many similarities. From the perspective of specific works, modern Japanese painting has unique features in terms of subject matter, techniques, style, and artistic conception. Taking landscape paintings as an example, Yokoyama Taikan's "Clouds Come and Go" mainly uses Mi dots in his brushwork, which is similar to the landscape paintings of the Great and Small Mis of the Song Dynasty in our country, but Taikan's composition and the artistic conception he expresses are purely Japanese landscapes. Taikan's paintings have the characteristics of grandeur and vigor, and he is worthy of being a master. The new school painters Yamamoto Kyujin and Nishiyama Suisho like to paint mountains, which is the tradition of Easterners, but their methods of taking scenes, composition, and modeling mostly take the rules of Western painting. Chinese paintings have themes such as dead trees, bamboos, and rocks. Japanese people also appreciate the composition of one grass, one flower, one tree, and one stone, but the poetic and artistic conception produced by small interests such as "rain-soaked blue tiles" or "snow-covered garden stones" is a unique cultivation of Japanese painters. In order to express this extremely subtle interest, Fukuda Heihachiro spared no effort to be meticulous and paid a lot of labor to complete the two works "Rain" and "New Snow." Japanese flower-and-bird paintings have accepted Chinese boneless, meticulous, and freehand techniques, but Japanese painters have their own ways of observing the angle of flowers and birds and expressing the emotions of flowers and birds. Yasuda Yukihiko's "Poppies", Kobayashi Kokei's "Peacock", Maeda Seison's "Red and White Plum", and Yoshioka Kenji's "Pheasant" all have distinct Japanese styles.

In terms of figure paintings, a more prominent work is Maeda Seison's "Before Going on Stage." This painting depicts the expression of a "Noh" actor who is about to go on stage after being made up. The actor wears a mask and cannot see his facial features, so the painter starts from the side and accurately portrays the personality and expression of the actor's two hands, thereby conveying the specific expression of this experienced old actor before going on stage. The image of this painting is located on the right side of the painting, and a large space is left behind the character, while the side facing the character appears quite cramped. This is a treatment that violates the conventional composition. The reason why the painter makes a unique arrangement is to illustrate the principle that form serves content, because the specific situation of "Before Going on Stage" requires such treatment. In addition to the fact that all artistic processing methods meet the requirements of realism, this painting also fully demonstrates a high degree of decorative effect, which is an important feature of Japanese painting. The author, Maeda Seison, is a veteran of the Japan Art Institute and is 75 years old this year. He led a delegation of Japanese painters to visit China during this exhibition. In addition to expressing our admiration for his exquisite artistic attainments, we also express our high respect for his contribution to Sino-Japanese cultural exchanges.

Kenzan Nanpu's "Portrait of Mr. O" is a very successful line drawing portrait. The painter uses concise brushstrokes to summarize the characteristics of the object in a state of contemplation. This image looks peaceful and elegant, and is thought-provoking. The portrait can achieve such an effect, which shows the vitality of line drawing in oriental painting. Ladies' painting is an important genre in Japanese traditional painting, and this exhibition also accounts for a considerable proportion. Among them, Kaburagi Kiyokata's "Summer in the Living Room" and Terashima Shimei's "Twilight" reflect two eras and two typical Japanese women's images.

There are two works in the exhibition depicting the lives of Japanese working people, one is Asakura Takeshi's "People Carrying Things" and the other is Watanabe Manabu's "Fish and People." The artistic techniques of these two painters are close to the modern schools of the West. Because they focus too much on the pursuit of the volume and space effects of the image's appearance, they ignore the expression of the characters' mental state. Even so, the sympathetic attitude of these two painters towards the lives of working people is very obvious. Therefore, the Chinese audience does not reduce their interest in these two paintings.

Maruki Iri, one of the authors of "Hiroshima Atomic Bomb Disaster Picture," which is admired and familiar to Chinese audiences, exhibited his ink and wash large hanging screen "Ox" this time. In the entire venue, this is a painting with a special style. It is special because it appears in a fighting posture in a bird-singing and flower-fragrant and character-beautiful environment. Maruki Iri used bold brushstrokes to paint a group of angry oxen. This group of oxen crowded the entire picture, strong and powerful, and magnificent. Obviously, the painter's purpose is not to express the ox itself, but to express his own fighting emotions through this painting. It makes us have a lot of associations.

After seeing this exhibition, we express our great respect for the outstanding achievements of Japanese artists in creating and protecting the national painting tradition. We firmly believe that Japanese artists will achieve greater victories in the struggle against U.S. imperialism and in the struggle to defend national culture. Japanese painters! Let us join hands, point our weapons at the reactionaries, at U.S. imperialism, and work hard to build a peaceful and friendly environment in Asia and to build a more beautiful and greater oriental culture and art!

    评日本现代画展并致日本画家
    叶浅予
    最近一个月以来，日本人民以雷霆之势，反对日美新安全条约，反对岸信介，反对艾森豪威尔访问日本，迫使战争瘟神不敢踏上日本的国土。日本人民的斗争打乱了美帝国主义在亚洲的侵略阵势，增加了保卫和平的力量。我们以十分关切的心情支持日本人民的斗争，为日本人民的胜利感到欢欣鼓舞。
    在这些斗争的日子里，“日本现代画展览会”在北京开幕了，热烈的开幕式充溢着胜利的喜悦，使那些丰富多彩的画幅更添上了一层光彩。尽管作品的内容并不直接反映日本人民的斗争生活，但从鲜明的民族风格中看到了日本艺术家创造和保卫民族绘画传统的决心和意志，就自然而然和当前的斗争联系了起来。
    我们知道，帝国主义的侵略除了在政治上经济上的压迫和剥削，最恶毒的一手就是对民族文化的破坏，使被压迫的民族永远做帝国主义文化的奴隶。自从第二次世界大战结束以来，随着美国的刺刀和资本，腐朽的美国生活方式输进了日本，在日本造成灾难。美国的腐朽文化当然也是美国生活方式的一部分，很难想像在绘画这个领域里不会遭到“颓废主义”、“抽象主义”等等细菌的腐蚀。现在看到日本画家在保卫和发扬民族艺术方面的贡献和成就，感到非常高兴。
    日本画和中国画有悠久的历史关系。自唐代一直到清末，中国绘画对日本画的发展有很多的影响。这中间比较显著的痕迹，最早是唐代的佛教画，中间是宋元时代的山水花鸟画，后期是明清时代的文人画。1956年被选为世界文化名人的日本画家雪舟，就是中日绘画艺术互相交融的杰出代表，他接受了南宋的马远夏圭一派的山水画，形成了自己独特的风格，其影响一直流传到后期的南画派。自从日本社会进入了资本主义，日本画家开始向西欧接受影响，使明治以后的日本画形成了新的风格。中国民主革命时期，在日本画的影响下，出现了以高奇峰高剑父兄弟为代表的中国岭南画派。这种相互的影响对于我们两国美术的发展都是有益的。
    日本画家所使用的工具和材料，和中国画家所使用的基本相同。纸、绢、笔、墨性能一样，调色用水用胶，也一样。题材内容和表现技法也有相同之处。比如，中国画家对自然美的探索，兴趣极广，所以发展了山水花鸟画，日本画家也非常爱慕自然，风景花鸟画也比较多。中国画的白描、水墨、重彩、勾填、没骨等技法，也都是日本画的基本技法。近代中国画题字盖章的体制，日本画家也当作构图的组成部分来看待。尽管有这么多相似之处，但是并不妨碍日本画的民族气派和民族特色的发展，这次展出的八十多件作品便是明证。
    在这个展览会里，前辈画家有日本美术院派的横山大观、小林古径、安田韧彦、前田青村，有日本美术展览会派的镝木清方、松林桂月，青龙社的川端龙子，独立的川合玉堂和小杉放庵等。老一辈画家的作品，具有比较鲜明的传统的特色，还能看到旧流派的遗风。这一类作品中流露着较为浓厚的浪漫主义色彩，是日本绘画传统里很可宝贵的因素。与此相对照的，是新起一代的作品，如青龙社派的川端龙子和新制作协会的许多后起之秀，在他们的作品里，传统的格调比较少，显然有了后期印象派以来西欧现代诸流派的痕迹，这种痕迹主要表现在艺术手法上，也有少数作品表现在题材内容上。比如，小仓游龟的《良夜》，画的是一个裸体少女，森田沙伊的《少年》，画着一个裸体的少年和三只狗在游戏。这些形象常见于欧洲现代流派的画幅中，在日本画里却是少见的。
    上面谈到日本画和中国画有许多相同之处，从具体的作品来看，现代日本画的取材、手法、格调和意境都有独特的面貌。以风景山水画而论，横山大观的《云来去》笔法主要是米点，近似我国宋代画家大小米的山水，但大观的构图和所表达的意境是纯粹的日本山水。大观的画具有气局雄健的特点，不愧为一位大师。新派画家山本丘人和西山英雄，喜欢画山，是东方人的传统，但其取景构图造形的方法则多取西方绘画的规律。中国画中有枯木竹石一类题材，日本人也欣赏一草一花一树一石的构图，但对“雨湿青瓦”或“雪被庭石”一类小趣味产生诗情画意，则是日本画家独有的修养，福田平八郎为了表现这种极为微妙的趣味，不惜尽精刻微付出了很大的劳动，完成《雨》和《新雪》两幅作品。日本的花鸟画曾经接受过中国的没骨、工笔、写意等技法，但日本画家观察花鸟的角度和表现花鸟的情态却有自己的方式。安田韧彦的《罂粟》、小林古径的《孔雀》、前田青村的《红白梅》、吉冈坚二的《雉子》，都具有鲜明的日本风格。
    人物画方面比较突出的作品有前田青村的《上场前》这幅画描写一个化装好了的“能”乐演员将要出场的神情，演员带着面具，看不见五官，画家便从侧面下手，准确地刻划了演员的两只手的个性和表情，从而传达出这位有舞台经验的老演员在出场前的具体神情。这幅画的形象位置偏靠画幅的右方，人物的背后空出一大片空间，而人物面向的一面反而显得相当局促，这是违反构图常规的处理，画家之所以作别出心裁的安排，正好说明形式服从内容这条原则，因为《上场前》的规定情景，正需要这样来处理。这幅画除了全部艺术处理方法符合现实主义的要求外，并且充分发挥了高度装饰效果，这正是日本画的一个重要特色。作者前田青村是院派的元老，今年已经七十五岁，在这次展览期间率领日本画家代表团来中国访问，我们除了对他的精湛的艺术造诣表示钦佩，同时，对他为中日文化交流所作的贡献表示崇高的敬意。
    坚山南凤的《O氏像》是一幅很成功的白描肖像。画家以简练的笔墨，概括了处在沉思状态中的对象的特征。这个形象看起来宁静淡雅，耐人寻味，肖像画能达到这样的效果，显示了线描功能在东方绘画中的生命力。仕女画是日本传统绘画中的一个重要流派，这次展览也占相当的比重，其中镝木青方的《客厅之夏》和寺岛紫明的《黄昏》，反映了两个时代和两类典型的日本妇女形象。
    展览会里有两幅描写日本劳动人民生活的作品，一幅是朝仓摄的《背东西的人》，一幅是渡边学的《鱼和人》。这两位画家的艺术手法接近西方的近代流派，因为过于偏重形象外貌的体积空间等效果的追求，因而忽略了人物精神状态的表现。虽然如此，这两位画家对于劳动人民生活所表示的同情态度，却是很明显的。因此中国的观众并不减少对这两幅画的兴趣。
    为中国观众所景仰和熟知的《广岛原子弹灾害图》的作者之一丸木位里，这次展出了他的水墨大挂屏《牛》。在整个会场里，这是一幅风格特殊的画。说它特殊，是因为它带着一种斗争的姿态出现在鸟语花香和人物绮丽的环境里。丸木位里用粗犷的笔调画了一群愤怒的牛，这群牛拥塞着整个画面，刚强有力，气势雄壮。显然，画家的目的不是在表现牛本身，而是通过这幅画来抒发自己的斗争的情绪。使我们有了很多的联想。
    看了这个展览会，对日本艺术家在创造和保卫民族绘画传统的卓越成就我们表示极大的敬意，我们深信日本美术家在反对美帝国主义的斗争中，在捍卫民族文化的斗争中必将取得更大的胜利。日本的画家们！让我们携起手来，把武器对准反动派，对准美帝国主义，为亚洲建立一个和平友好的环境，为建设更美丽更伟大的东方文化艺术而努力吧！
