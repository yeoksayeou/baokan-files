Based on local conditions, learning the "Two-Five System" leadership experience
Shuangliao County implements "Three-Seven System" leadership method
After implementing the "Three-Seven System," the vast majority of cadres go deep into the forefront of production; a large number of "Five-Good" cadres appear throughout the county; investigation and research increase, meetings and reports decrease

Xinhua News Agency report: Shuangliao County, Jilin Province, in learning and promoting the "Two-Five System" leadership experience of Wuqiao County, Hebei, has implemented the "Three-Seven System" leadership method, based on the county's characteristics of vast land, dispersed population, and inconvenient transportation, further improving leadership style. The vast majority of cadres go deep into the forefront of production, resulting in a new atmosphere in summer hoeing production where everyone is motivated, tools are ingenious, labor efficiency is high, and hoeing is fast and good.

In recent years, Shuangliao County has implemented the "Fifty System" leadership method among cadres at all levels, meaning working in the field for ten days and working in the office for five days, which strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses and promoted production. However, the implementation lacked specific measures and requirements, and coupled with numerous meetings and documents, cadres still spent a relatively long time in the office. Recently, the Shuangliao County Party Committee studied the experience of Wuqiao County in implementing the "Two-Five System" leadership method, believing it to be a good method for integrating learning, research, and work summaries. Based on the county's characteristics, they researched and formulated the "Three-Seven System" leadership method, which means that county, commune, and management district cadres spend the first three days of every ten days learning, holding meetings, summarizing and checking, and arranging current work, and the latter seven days going deep into the front lines of production, participating in production, leading production, and specifically solving key problems in production.

At the beginning of the "Three-Seven System" implementation, a few cadres participated in production a lot, but did not pay enough attention to leading production, and did not pay attention to discovering and solving problems. Some cadres spent more time traveling than working, and were not good at consulting with the masses. After returning from the countryside, some were unable to escape the circle of routine work and could not study properly. In response to this situation, the Shuangliao County Party Committee decided to implement a contract system, with leading cadres taking responsibility all the way down, establishing fixed points year-round, and being responsible for a management district or production brigade. It was also required that each cadre bring a labor work point record book, a work diary, and a study notebook when going to the countryside, recording work, labor, learning activities, experiences, and problems; to eat in the canteen, live in the production team, and work in the fields; to submit two written reports to the county party committee each month, with the reports including investigated situations, typical examples, experiences, identifying major problems, and proposing solutions; and to combine production and work, and consistently study Chairman Mao's works. At the same time, the county launched a "Five-Good Cadre" competition movement centered on the conscientious promotion of the "Three-Seven System." After taking these measures, the number of cadres at all levels going deep into the front lines of production increased from the original 1,550 to more than 2,500, and the county has produced twenty-one "Five-Good" cadre pacesetters and three hundred and thirty "Five-Good" cadres.

After implementing the "Three-Seven System" leadership method, cadres went deep into the front lines and first helped backward production teams catch up with advanced production teams. For example, among the one hundred and sixty-two production teams in Wangben Commune, thirty-three teams were relatively backward in hoeing. These teams were assisted by four commune party committee secretaries, ten party committee members, and thirty-one county cadres under contract, and quickly caught up with the advanced. Secondly, cadres were able to promptly discover, summarize, and promote advanced experiences, which promoted the work. For example, Su Xing, Secretary of the County Party Committee Secretariat, and Yu Haibin, Secretary of the Shuangshan Commune Party Committee, went deep into the Yongjia Management District and summarized the experience of vigorously reforming tools to accelerate hoeing progress. They immediately convened an on-site meeting, launched a mass movement, and reformed one thousand two hundred hoeing tools in three days. The commune achieved semi-mechanized hoeing, and the daily hoeing progress increased from 520 hectares to more than 2,000 hectares. Based on the experience of the Yongjia Management District, the County Party Committee made a decision to vigorously reform tools, and each commune used indigenous methods, relied on the masses, and relied on their own efforts to vigorously reform hoeing tools, accelerating the summer hoeing progress and improving quality.

After implementing the "Three-Seven System," cadres going deep into the front lines of production became institutionalized, and a new atmosphere emerged with cadres going deeper into reality, participating in more labor, conducting more investigation and research, solving more problems, reducing meetings, and reducing documents and reports.

### 因地制宜学习“二五制”领导经验  双辽县实行“三七制”领导方法

    因地制宜学习“二五制”领导经验
    双辽县实行“三七制”领导方法
    实行“三七制”以后，绝大部分干部深入生产第一线；全县出现大批“五好”干部；调查研究增多，会议、表报减少
    据新华社讯　吉林省双辽县在学习和推行河北吴桥县“二五制”领导经验中，根据本县土地辽阔、居住分散、交通不便的特点，实行
  “三七制”领导方法，进一步改进了领导作风，绝大部分干部深入生产第一线，使夏锄生产出现了人人干劲足，件件工具巧，劳动效率高，铲趟快又好的新气象。
    近几年来，双辽县在各级干部中曾经实行“五十”制领导方法，即下去工作十天，上来办公五天，密切了干部和群众的关系，促进了生产。但是，执行中缺少具体措施和要求，加上会议多、文件表报多，干部在办公室的时间还是较长。最近，中共双辽县委学习了吴桥县实行“二五制”领导方法的经验，认为这是把学习、研究、总结工作互相结合起来的好方法。他们根据本县特点，研究制定了“三七制”的领导方法，就是县、公社、管理区干部，在十天中，前三天学习、开会、总结检查和安排当前工作，后七天深入生产第一线，参加生产，领导生产，具体解决生产中的关键问题。
    在开始推行“三七制”时，有少数干部参加生产多，对领导生产注意不够，不注意发现问题，解决问题。有的干部下去后，转的时间多，干的时间少，不善于同群众商量。下乡回来，有的又脱不出事务圈子，不能好好学习。中共双辽县委针对这种情况，决定实行包干的办法，领导干部一竿子插到底，常年定点，包干负责一个管理区或生产大队。还要求每个干部下乡都要带劳动记工本、工作日记本、学习笔记本，记载工作、劳动、学习活动情况、经验和问题；要做到吃在食堂，住在生产队，办公在田间；每月向县委作两次书面报告，报告中要有经过调查的情况、典型、经验，找出主要问题，提出解决意见；结合生产和工作，坚持经常学习毛主席著作等。同时，全县开展了以认真推广“三七制”为中心的“五好干部”竞赛运动。采取这些措施以后，各级干部深入生产第一线的，已由原来一千五百五十名增加到二千五百多名，全县已出现二十一名“五好”干部标兵和三百三十名
  “五好”干部。
    推行“三七制”的领导方法，各级干部深入第一线后，首先帮助后进的生产队赶上了先进的生产队。如王奔公社的一百六十二个生产小队中，有三十三个队铲趟比较落后，这些队由四名公社党委书记、十名党委委员、三十一名县的干部包干负责帮助后，很快就赶上了先进。其次，干部们能及时发现、总结和推广先进经验，推动了工作。如县委书记处书记苏醒和双山公社党委书记于海滨，深入永加管理区总结了大搞工具改革加快铲趟进度的经验，立即召开现场会议，大搞群众运动，三天改制铲趟工具一千二百多件，全社实现了铲趟半机械化，铲趟日进度由五百二十公顷增加到二千多公顷。县委根据永加管理区的经验做出了大搞工具改革的决定，各公社都土法上马、依靠群众、自力更生，大搞铲趟工具改革，加快了夏锄进度，并且提高了质量。
    实行了“三七制”以后，干部深入生产第一线形成制度，出现干部深入实际多、参加劳动多、调查研究多、解决问题多、会议减少、文件表报减少的新气象。（附图片）
