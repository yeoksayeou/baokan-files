Xinhua News Agency, 17th. The Chinese Buddhist Association held a Dharma assembly at Guangji Temple this afternoon to commemorate the martyrs who died in the "June 15th" tragedy in Japan, killed by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries.

The Dharma assembly was presided over by Vice President of the Chinese Buddhist Association, Dharma Master Jucan. Vice President of the Chinese Buddhist Association Zhao Puchu, Zhou Shujia and others participated in the Dharma assembly.

The Japanese literary delegation headed by Hiroshi Noma, who are currently visiting China, as well as Japanese peace activist Kinkazu Saionji in Beijing also attended the Dharma assembly.

Hiroshi Noma delivered a eulogy at the Dharma assembly, saying that the Japanese people made heroic sacrifices in the struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and Eisenhower's "visit" to Japan, and have already achieved the victory of forcing Eisenhower to "postpone his visit" to Japan.

He said: Before the spirits of the martyrs, we recall their heroic sacrifices in this fierce battle, which makes us feel boundless hatred for the vicious imperialism and militarism.

Hiroshi Noma said: The noble activities engaged in by the martyrs in their short lives did not end because of their sacrifice, and will continue to develop in the future. We will continue to carry forward the spirit of their struggle. The blood they shed in the struggle will boil in the veins of our Japanese people. In the future, the struggle of the Japanese people will be carried out more fiercely and will comfort the heroic spirits of the martyrs with the final victory.
