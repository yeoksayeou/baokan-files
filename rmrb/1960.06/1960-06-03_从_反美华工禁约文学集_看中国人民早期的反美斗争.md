From "Collection of Anti-American Chinese Labor Exclusion Act Literature" - Seeing the Early Anti-American Struggle of the Chinese People
    A Ying

    It can be said that American imperialism has been up to no good since its very beginning as an imperialist power. Taking its relationship with China, even before the Opium War, it was selling opium to China and poisoning the Chinese people, just like British imperialism. Even the ships transporting opium were specially made, called "Opium Clippers." A significant amount of the opium burned by Lin Zexu in Humen was surrendered by the United States under British names. In reality, American imperialism was a behind-the-scenes player in the Opium War.

    During the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom period, American imperialism helped the reactionary Qing rulers attack the Taiping army. Later, American imperialism, along with other imperialist powers, launched the Eight-Nation Alliance invasion of China, bringing great suffering to the Chinese people. However, what angered the Chinese people the most was the decades-long, cruel mistreatment of Chinese laborers in the United States. This led to the anti-American Chinese Labor Exclusion Act movement in 1905. This movement not only exposed the ingratitude and various atrocities of American imperialism towards the Chinese people to all of China and the world but also tore off the ugly mask of American imperialism for the first time. It strongly embodied the patriotic enthusiasm of the Chinese people in opposing American imperialism, and confirmed the truth of Chairman Mao's statement that "the process of imperialism and Chinese feudalism combining to turn China into a semi-colony and colony is also the process of the Chinese people resisting imperialism and its running dogs."

    In these days when people all over the world are angrily condemning American imperialism for its aggression against the socialist camp and its wolfish ambition to enslave the world, and are uniting to overthrow American imperialism, we can gain a clearer understanding of the essence of American imperialism and further strengthen our confidence in overthrowing American imperialism by looking back at the early atrocities of American imperialism against the Chinese people and the Chinese people's soaring patriotic enthusiasm and fighting spirit against American imperialism from the earliest literary and artistic documents of the Chinese people's opposition to American imperialism. The "Collection of Anti-American Chinese Labor Exclusion Act Literature" published by Zhonghua Book Company is a part of these valuable literary and artistic documents. From this book, we can see the crimes of American imperialism in persecuting our workers for nearly a century and the early anti-American struggle of our people.

    I

    According to reliable sources, Chinese people were "invited" to the United States to work as early as the 27th year of the Daoguang reign (1847). At that time, California had just been annexed by the United States and was eager to colonize; however, few immigrants from Europe and the eastern United States went there because of its remoteness. In addition, gold mines needed to be mined and railways needed to be built, all of which required labor. Therefore, they came to China to "invite" workers. It can be said that the development and construction of this state in the United States mainly relied on Chinese people.

    The so-called "invitation" was actually "deception." American capitalists used Hong Kong as a base to distribute leaflets and pictures in the coastal areas of South China, exaggerating the wealth of San Francisco and luring Chinese people to become coolies. "Their status was equal to slaves, their wages were half of those of local people, they paid more taxes than anyone else, and they were subjected to endless oppression." ("Zhigang's Diary")

    As late as February 1959, "Reader's Digest" in the United States published an article by Abbott Meashoar, recalling the tragic experiences of the Chinese people during that period. As the number of Chinese workers gradually increased, white people with xenophobic prejudices began to attack the Chinese. Incidents of fraud, abuse, and even murder of Chinese people occurred one after another. Gradually, the Chinese left the mining areas of California and returned to their hometowns with frustration and disappointment.

    "In 1865, the United States wanted to lay a railway line across the country and found that a large number of Chinese people were needed to engage in road construction work.

    "In the winter of 1866, the Chinese built roads on high mountains with fifteen feet of snow, blizzards, and air so bad that even people resting felt short of breath. They worked twelve hours a day, cutting through thorns and digging mountains. Later, as the railway line progressed, they worked in the deserts of Nevada. The sun in the desert was like fire, and the temperature was as high as 120 degrees. Although the Chinese were sweating like rain, they worked as usual.

    "However, every time the railway was built, the Chinese were immediately dismissed, and they were not even given the job of maintaining the road.

    "At that time, there were many hard jobs that white people were unwilling to do. These laborers from China dug canals and built embankments south of Sacramento, turning 400,000 acres of swamp into fertile land. They also worked as loggers and went out to sea to fish, and before being excluded by the whites, they had worked in canning factories.

    "In the 1880s, the Chinese accounted for the largest number of agricultural immigrants in California. However, in agriculture, as in other industries..., the Chinese could not gain a foothold. They could not make a living in agriculture, were discriminated against and excluded everywhere, and finally had to go to the cities to find a livelihood. However, in the cities, they encountered the same situation and were subjected to all kinds of exclusion. The scope of their occupations became narrower and narrower, and finally they were limited to working as waiters in restaurants, managing flower gardens for white people, managing chores in white families, and doing laundry work.

    "In order to crack down on the Chinese in the United States, California passed a bill to levy discriminatory head taxes on the Chinese. The courts declared that they could not be naturalized, and even deprived them of the right to testify in court even to protect themselves. The American West Coast newspapers referred to the entry of Chinese into the United States as the 'Yellow Peril'. Anti-Chinese atrocities continued to occur in Los Angeles, Tacoma, Seattle, and San Francisco."

    From this American material alone, we can see how American capitalists exploited the blood and sweat of the Chinese people, and finally ungratefully used various regulations to viciously slander, restrict, or expel the Chinese.

    In the third year of the Guangxu reign (1877), the industrial sector of California experienced an economic panic, with stocks falling, trade declining, and industry stagnating. As a result, the American government suppressed the Chinese even more. The new state constitution of 1879 contained the following clauses:

    1.  Factories and companies are not allowed to employ Chinese people. Even contracts previously signed with Chinese people will be treated as waste paper.
    2.  Chinese people are not allowed to have the right to vote and are not allowed to be employed in public occupations.
    3.  The parliament must enact regulations to punish companies that recruit Chinese laborers.
    4.  Those Chinese in the United States must be subject to regulations to restrict them, and if they do not comply with the regulations, they will be deported.

    This anti-Chinese worker movement in this state soon affected the whole country. Therefore, the first clause of the Beijing Treaty of the sixth year of the Guangxu reign (1880) stated: "...If Chinese laborers hinder the interests of the United States or disturb the residents of the country, the Qing Dynasty shall allow the United States of America to temporarily suspend or set the number of people or limit the number of years, not completely prohibiting it, but must be moderately limited." Once this proposal was established, the United States promulgated fifteen "prohibitions," and when the treaty was renewed, the conditions became even harsher, eventually increasing to as many as sixty-one.

    The prohibitions became more and more harsh, and later developed to the point that there were prohibitions not only on Chinese workers but also on Chinese students. The prohibitions were: 1. "No work-study is allowed," and those found will be deported back to their country. 2. "Only those who study advanced knowledge are allowed to enter the country." 3. "You must prepare the expenses required from the beginning of your studies to graduation," otherwise you will not be allowed to enter the country.

    In addition, there were many ways to restrict Chinese from entering the country. For example, using the pretext that the clauses did not conform to the requirements, they were not allowed to land; using the pretext of investigation, they were placed in "wooden houses"; stubbornly claiming that students and businessmen were workers; using epidemic prevention as a pretext, and so on. At that time, many Chinese laborers were forced to jump into the sea because they could not land and had no money to return to their country. Even if they entered the country, there were still various harsh regulations that made them unable to be free.

    In this way, the number of Chinese in the United States decreased from 300,000 to 100,000 in the twenty years between 1883 and 1903.

    In the 30th year of the Guangxu reign (1904), it was again the time when the "Beijing Treaty" expired, and the Americans once again demanded renewal. The Chinese in the United States launched a movement against the prohibition. They held a meeting at the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association in San Francisco, demanding that the Chinese government strive to refuse to sign. Then the country also responded and implemented a boycott of American goods. This was the vigorous anti-American Chinese Labor Exclusion Act movement at that time.

    II

    The anti-American Chinese Labor Exclusion Act movement occurred in the year of Yisi in the Guangxu reign (1905). The earliest reflection of the mistreatment of Chinese laborers by American imperialism in literary and artistic works was the "Expelling Guests" in Huang Zunxian's "Human Realm Cottage Poetry Collection" in the eighth year of the Guangxu reign (1882). However, if we trace further back, we can find that as early as the 27th year of the Daoguang reign (1847), the poet had already foreseen the unfortunate fate of the Chinese laborers who went to the United States at that time. The earliest epic about Chinese workers related to the United States, "Jinshan Chapter", was published in the "Songxin Poetry Collection" Gui Ji "Caotang Collection" Volume 3 of Zhang Weiping, the author of the famous anti-British poem "Sanyuanli". According to the initial situation reflected in that poem, it is sufficient to explain several problems: 1. At that time, American imperialism seized huge profits, while the treatment of Chinese workers was very bitter. 2. At this time, there were only tens of thousands of Fujianese and Cantonese people who went there, which was very different from the later 200,000 or 300,000. The treatment in the initial golden age was like this, so it is even more conceivable later. 3. Chinese workers made great contributions to the creation of new and old San Francisco, but American imperialism repaid kindness with hatred and finally expelled the Chinese unreasonably. The poet was extremely disgusted by this and advocated that the state should run mining, reclamation, and other industries, which could not only enrich the people but also enrich the country, so-called "enriching the people and benefiting the people without spending, enriching the people and enriching the country are originally connected." This is consistent with his spirit of "do not hold thrift as a high theory, want to help the poor and disperse the rich" (Pearl River), which is based on the people. This is the earliest voice of our country against American imperialism.

    Huang Zunxian's "Expelling Guests" was written more than 30 years after "Jinshan Chapter". At this time, the number of Chinese workers had reached more than 200,000, the contradiction had expanded, and the prohibition had already begun. The situation reflected in the poem, in which Chinese workers created great wealth for the United States but were limited and expelled, is true and painful. However, because the author was standing on the position of the "Westernization faction" and was also a diplomat, although he also had patriotic enthusiasm, it was inevitable that he would be distorted. Another "Westernization faction" and famous poet Zheng Guanying (Taozhai) also had three topics about the Chinese labor exclusion act in the "Luofu Waiting for Crane Mountain House Poetry Collection": "Book Resisting the American Prohibition of Chinese Entry", "Mourning Yellow People", "Shanghai Rescue Association Fellow Zeng Jun Shaoqing Telegraphed that the United States Abuses Overseas Chinese, Please Tell Compatriots to Boycott American Goods as a Resistance Name, Called Rejecting the Treaty Association, Compose This to Commemorate It". In the poem, he pointed out that Chinese workers in the United States could not get the protection of the Chinese government, so-called "Chinese servants go abroad, the government does not protect them." However, American imperialism "strictly prohibits them from coming, and the harsh rules are difficult to describe," and it is harsh and unreasonable, "because the United States abuses overseas Chinese, and the harshness is unreasonable." He affirmed that the Chinese people are patriotic, so-called "the people's will is commendable," hoping to resist to the end: "The top and bottom compete for national dignity, and sovereignty must be defended without loss." In the "Mourning Yellow People" article, he said:

    ...Since the sea ban was opened, workers were recruited to the United States. More and more people went abroad, just to find food. The big port opened Jinshan, and the wilderness was reclaimed. Yellow people are engaged in business, and business crowns the north and south. How could the American government not think of us as virtuous. Burning and killing rampantly, disasters arise unexpectedly. Harshly prohibiting our Chinese people, not allowing them to set foot in that country. ...

    It more specifically pointed out the ingratitude of American imperialism and the Qing government's "knowing how to have people but not protecting them, driving them into nets." He pointed out that after the boycott movement started, American imperialism was very "shocked" and began to show its paper tiger prototype, preparing to compromise. However, the Qing government surrendered to the American government, and the Chinese big bourgeoisie compromised with them, so the United States became tough again. The poem reflects many situations at that time. As for how strong the people's morale was at that time, it was as written by the famous artist Wang Xiaonong (Chuan) in the poem "Hearing of Rejecting the Treaty": "A roar wakes up the sleeping lion, and the big bird sings in alarm for three years. The people's morale can be greatly used, and commercial power may be contested from now on." He had already begun to foresee the great power of the Chinese people. The Chinese people cannot tolerate such ingratitude from American imperialism and the mistreatment of Chinese laborers. Wang Weicheng's two chapters of "New Yuefu" and the eight chapters of Mo Dengxianzhuren's "National Hatred" are all good works filled with indignant accusations. Nanquanjushi also selected and compiled the eight chapters of "National Hatred" into the Haiqiao Chun Legend. This poem details the dangerous situation of China at that time, and that American imperialism was our main enemy at that time, calling on the people to boycott American goods and unite to save the country:

    National hatred! National hatred! Where is the national hatred flashing? Please open your eyes and look at the Western Hemisphere. The new and old San Francisco are not enough to satisfy the greedy desires, and the huge tongue is like a dustpan, trying to lick the cream of our China! Alas! National hatred!

    National hatred! National hatred! The glittering and bright cities of the five capitals are full of hatred goods, and tell the people to search for ten days and do not submerge them. Now there is no justice in the world, and when you see the American goods, you throw them away together. Alas! National hatred! The poem also mentioned the conspiracy of the Chinese in the United States to be mistreated with "the teeth of mad tigers and the claws of giant wolves, they will not stop until they kill our Chinese people." The poem is written with grief and indignation.

    Because most of the Fujianese and Cantonese people were in the United States, the movement in Fujian and Guangdong, in addition to Shanghai, also unfolded very fiercely. Many poems and songbooks were written in local languages. The longest one seen is the two-volume Boycott America, the upper volume sings about the mistreatment of Chinese workers in the United States, and the lower volume promotes the boycott of American goods. Similar songbooks had a great impact at that time. Such as Haitang Temple Quick Talk, Hanging Cigarette Dragon Boat Song "Chinese Workers' Lament", "Jinshan Passengers Sigh Five Watches", "Good Child", etc., were also works that were widely circulated at that time.

    III

    The novel exposing the persecution of Chinese laborers by the American government is "Bitter Society", the first collection of forty-eight chapters. It was published by Shenbao Hall in July of the thirty-first year of the Guangxu reign (1905).

    The content of "Bitter Society" is a very realistic history of the blood and tears of Chinese laborers, especially after the twentieth chapter, the suffering of the Chinese being mistreated is appalling. Of all the novels reflecting this aspect, this one is the most profound and painful.

    The book narrates that after the Chinese laborers boarded the ship, they were immediately abused. Thousands of people were locked in the cabin, and the windows and doors were closed. They ate hard steamed buns and were not allowed to be full. No one cared about their illnesses; whipping and chaining were common.

    After reading this book, we can see what kind of dark hell the Chinese laborers lived in. It was like this during the sea voyage, and it was the same when they arrived at their destination and in the work area. For example, "The workshop is less than three feet deep in the high places, and less than five feet wide in the wide places. You have to bend your body to get in. There is no bed or table, only a layer of straw is laid on the ground, which is wet and cold when you step on it... There are rafters but no tiles on the top, and it is thinly covered with grass... Each room has to accommodate four people, which is not too much, but each person only occupies one foot and two inches of land. When you stand, you can't lift your head; when you sleep, you can't straighten your legs..." (Chapter 30) Not only that, but also iron cables are used to lock four people together, and cavalry patrols are stationed outside the house.

    The second book is "Golden World", divided into two volumes, written by Master Biheguan and published by Xiaoshuo Lin in 1907. The book begins by writing about how Americans used traitorous foremen to abduct and sell "piglets," as well as the suffering of the workers on the way and in the "wooden houses." It also writes about the situation of rejecting the treaty in Shanghai, as well as the conflict between the business and academic circles there. Some bourgeois elements smuggled American goods, wavered and compromised, and the American government coerced the Qing government to undermine the anti-American movement, dissolve the treaty rejection organization, and arrest enthusiastic activists, etc. It continues to write about how some people wanted to pool capital to revitalize national industry, but failed because they did not get the sympathy of merchants and wealthy people.

    This novel reflects the inhuman lives and resistance of Chinese laborers in the United States at that time. Today, in the movies produced by imperialism, especially American imperialism, we can often see countless slaves locked in ships, constantly whipped with leather whips by some bare-chested, burly men with thick beards. They shout, endure, and lick their wounds, and when they can't bear it any longer, they unite to resist. This book also has the same description. For example, it writes that the Chinese workers who boarded the ship could not afford a meal costing five cents, so they had no choice but to cook some thin soup with the rice they brought. Who knew that just as "the water was gradually heating up and the fragrance of porridge was overflowing, and the masses were drooling," it was "thrown into the sea together with the pot," and "they raised their leather whips and hit them indiscriminately." There are many similar descriptions, which shows how the golden country at that time mistreated Chinese laborers, treating them even worse than pigs and dogs! Its writing about "wooden house" life is more detailed than "Bitter Society."

    The third book is "Strange Tales of Rejecting the Treaty", written by Chinese Blood-Cooling Man and published by Qizhi Bookstore in the thirty-second year of the Guangxu reign (1906). The author's advocacy reflected in the book is that boycotting American goods is not a fundamental solution. The most important thing is to revitalize our own domestic industry and commerce first. Therefore, he takes a character called Sick Man as the center, writing about his radical cure methods. He does not get support in the treaty rejection association, so he runs to a remote place alone to purchase machines, train workers, establish factories, and develop industry. As for the "rejecting the treaty" issue, Sick Man also has different opinions from others: "It is okay not to say boycott, but if you say boycott, you must seek permanent peace in one fell swoop, and you must abolish the 'rules'. ... If the 'rules' are not abolished for a day, my compatriots will be humiliated as before, and insulted as before. Therefore, I secretly plan two strategies: internally, for the government, we should seek not to renew the treaty with the United States, so as to prevent the Americans from adding 'rules'. Externally, for the United States, we should seek to abolish the 'rules'. Unless all the 'rules' are lifted, my boycott will never be lifted." He believes that this "internal saying not to renew the treaty, external saying to abolish the rules" is the most appropriate method. The whole book is 40,000 words and is self-described as a "Kai Zhi Novel".

    The fourth book is "Poor Students", ten chapters, written by Qiyouzi, serialized in Embroidered Novel (1905), and not published in a separate edition. This book writes about the experience of a poor student in the United States working part-time while studying. Because he "worked part-time," the United States "separately formulated several new rules specifically for Chinese students," saying that he "should no longer work as a worker, and ordered the factory owner to drive him out of the factory within twenty hours." The school also used the excuse that he had been a worker and kicked him out. He angrily went to find the Chinese minister, but was reprimanded by the minister: "Aren't you a laughing stock for being chased from the east and chased from the west? I don't like to take care of this matter, but you have made the teacher pester me so tightly. What are you planning?" The book exposes these darknesses, and also writes about two kinds of Americans. Another kind is the American who sympathizes with Chinese workers and supports work-study programs. Zhang Yinhuan's Three Continents Diary also writes about this aspect. This is the situation of the book regarding the Chinese Labor Exclusion Act.

    The fifth book is "Ashes After the Disaster", sixteen chapters, written by Wu Yao (Jianren), with a Monthly Novel edition. The book narrates the experiences of the heroine's husband after being lured and sold as a "piglet," undergoing untold hardships. In the end, the woman was rescued, and the man also escaped from the United States.

    After the failure of the anti-Chinese Labor Exclusion Act movement, American Secretary of War Taft came to Shanghai from the Philippines (1908), and the local gentry and merchants held a grand welcoming party. Wu Jianren was very angry when he saw this situation, and wrote the short story "The Legend of the Ghosts Crying at the Renjing Society", with the words "Written with tears by Wu Jianren of the South China Sea" signed. The reason for saying "The Legend of the Ghosts Crying" is that when the boycott started, Feng Xiawei, a member of the Renjing Society, was deeply afraid that the movement could not be sustained, so he committed suicide to inspire the people. This article writes about the ghost crying on the night of the welcoming party, and the shameless flattery of the Shanghai gentry and merchants. Although the writing is not good, it shows Wu Jianren's indignation. In addition, the "Fiction Monthly" (published by Commercial Press) at that time also published the short story "Tears of Overseas Chinese" and Xu Zhiyan's "The Return of Piglets".

    Regarding the legend of the Chinese Labor Exclusion Act, only one volume of Nanquanjushi's "Haiqiao Chun" is seen. The number of volumes in the whole book is unknown, and both the first and second volumes obtained successively are bound into one volume, with a total of twelve acts. It was published by Guangzhi Bookstore, and the publication date is not indicated. The whole book is interspersed with the author Nanquanjushi and the female knight Dunyun, narrating the main situation of the anti-Chinese Labor Exclusion Act movement. With the alternation of new and old national souls, it inspires the people to oppose the Chinese Labor Exclusion Act, strive to become stronger, and the feeling of indignation jumps on the paper. At least two more volumes of this play have not been written or printed. Other works belonging to the category of opera and folk art include the eighth act of the upper volume of Qing's "Civilization Lamp of the 20th Century Women's World", as well as the class version of "The Fan Seller with Intentions" (written by Mingming), "Rejection Report" (written by Longxi Sanlang), "Living Sacrifice of Three Martyrs" (written by Fengping Old Master), and so on. From the "The Fan Seller with Intentions" article, we can know that at that time, there was also a kind of artistic propaganda work of drawing anti-American folding fans and selling them on the streets.

    In addition, in terms of essays and newspaper articles, there are even more countless articles criticizing American imperialism's "Chinese Labor Exclusion Act" and exposing the American empire's mistreatment of Chinese laborers.

    From this simple review of these textual materials, we can see the early ferocious face of American imperialism and the blood debts it owes to the Chinese people. The Chinese people have never succumbed to American imperialism. Even under such difficult conditions, the Chinese people still launched a vigorous anti-American Chinese Labor Exclusion Act struggle, using literary forms to expose the Chinese Labor Exclusion Act, using practical actions to boycott the Chinese Labor Exclusion Act, awaken the masses, and carry out resistance. Therefore, these materials still have a great educational effect on us today.

    从“反美华工禁约文学集”  看中国人民早期的反美斗争
    阿英
    美帝国主义，可以说，从它作为帝国主义的先天时期起，就一直不做好事。拿它和中国的关系说罢，在鸦片战争之前，也和英帝国主义一样，向中国贩卖鸦片，毒害中国人民，甚至连运鸦片的船都是特制的，叫做“鸦片飞剪船”。林则徐在虎门烧的烟土，就有不少是美国用英国名义缴出来的。鸦片战争，美帝国主义实际上是幕后的当事者。
    到了太平天国时期，美帝国主义又帮助反动的清统治者攻打太平军。以后美帝国主义又和其他帝国主义发动了八国联军的侵华战争，给中国人民带来很大的苦难，而最使中国人民愤怒的，却是连续数十年、残酷虐待在美华工的事。这就爆发了1905年的反对美国华工禁约运动。这一运动不但向全中国、全世界揭穿了美帝国主义对中国人民的忘恩负义和种种暴行，也是第一回撕破了美帝国主义丑恶的嘴脸，并非常强烈的体现了中国人民反对美帝国主义的爱国热情，证实了毛主席说的“帝国主义和中国封建主义相结合，把中国变为半殖民地和殖民地的过程，也就是中国人民反抗帝国主义及其走狗的过程”的真理。
    在这全世界人民愤怒谴责美帝国主义向社会主义阵营进行侵略和它的奴役全球的狼子野心，团结起来打倒美帝国主义的日子里，我们从最早的中国人民反对美帝国主义运动的文艺文献里，来回溯一下美帝国主义早期对中国人民的暴行，和中国人民昂扬的反对美帝国主义的爱国热情与斗志，是能帮助我们更清晰的认识美帝国主义的本质，更进一步加强打倒美帝国主义的信心的。中华书局出版的“反美华工禁约文学集”，就是这些宝贵的文艺文献的一部分。从这本书里，我们可以看到美帝国主义近一世纪来迫害我国工人的罪行和我国人民早期的反美斗争。
    一
    据可靠的材料，中国人被“招请”到美国佣工，最早是在道光二十七年（1847年）。当时加里福尼亚州新合并于美国，急于拓殖；而欧洲和美国东部的移民，惮其辽远，去的很少。加以金矿要开采，铁路要建设，在在需要劳动力，于是到中国来“招请”。美国这一州的开拓建设，可以说主要依靠了中国人。
    所谓“招请”，实际上就是“拐骗”。美国资本家以香港作基地，在华南沿海地区散发传单和图片，渲染旧金山的富庶，诱骗中国人去当苦力。“地位等于奴隶，工资比本地人少一半，纳税比任何人都多，被抑勒的事更是层出不穷。”（“志刚日记”）
    直到1959年2月，美国“读者文摘”还发表了阿勃特·梅绍尔的文章，回溯那一时期中国人的悲惨遭遇。随着中国工人的人数日渐增加，有排外偏见的白人们，开始向中国人进行攻击。对中国人施行诈骗、虐待，甚至把他们杀死的事件也相继发生。逐渐地，中国人离开了加利福尼亚州的矿区，怀着懊丧失望的心情回到家乡去。
    “1865年，美国要铺设一条贯通全国的铁路，又发现需要大批中国人来从事筑路工作。
    “1866年冬天，中国人在积雪十五呎高，风雪交加，空气恶劣到使休息着的人也感到气喘心悸的高山上筑路。他们每天工作十二小时，披荆斩棘，凿石开山。后来，随着铁路线的进展，他们又在尼瓦达州的沙漠里工作。沙漠里烈日如火，气温高达一百二十度。中国人虽然挥汗如雨，却像平常一样工作。
    “但是，每一次铁路筑好了，中国人便马上被辞退，连做养路工的份儿都没有。
    “当时，白人不愿干的苦差还有许多。这些从中国来的劳动者，在萨克拉孟多以南开凿运河及修筑堤岸，把四十万英亩的沼泽变为沃土良田。他们还当伐木工人及出海捕鱼，以及在受到白人的排斥之前，曾经在罐头工厂里工作。
    “十九世纪八十年代，中国人在加利福尼亚州的农业移民中占最大多数。但是，在农业中像在别的行业中一样……，中国人也无法立足了。他们在农业中无法谋生，到处被歧视，受排挤，最后只好到城市中去找寻生计。但是，在城市中，他们也碰到同样的遭遇，备受排挤。他们的职业范围越来越狭小，最后被局限于在餐室里当杂役，替白人管理花圃，在白人家庭里管理杂务，以及干洗衣工作。
    “为了打击在美国的中国人，加利福尼亚州通过了一项法案，向中国人课歧视性的人头税。法院宣布，他们不能入籍，甚至褫夺了他们即使为了保护自己而在法庭上作证的权利。对于中国人进入美国，美国西岸的报纸指为‘黄祸’。在洛杉矶、大哥马、西雅图和旧金山，排华的暴行不断发生。”
    就从这美国方面的材料里，也可以看出当时美国资本家是如何压榨中国人的血汗，最后还忘恩负义的用种种条例，恶毒的诬蔑、限制或驱逐中国人。
    到了光绪三年（1877年），加里福尼亚州的产业界发生了经济恐慌，股票跌落，贸易不振，工业停顿。因此美国政府对中国人就更加压制。1879年的州新宪法里，便有了以下条款：
    一、各工厂公司不许用中国人。即有前此与中国人定合同者，亦作为废纸。
    二、中国人不许有选举权，不许受雇于公家职业。
    三、议院须订条例以罚招华工之公司。
    四、中国人之在美国者，须设例规以限制之，苟不遵例，即驱逐出境。
    这一州的反中国工人运动，不久便影响了全国。所以光绪六年（1880年）的北京条约，第一款就说：“……华工倘有妨碍美国之利益，或有骚扰境内居民等情，大清国准大美国议暂止，或定人数，或限年数，并非尽行禁绝，总须酌中定限。”此议既立，美国便颁布“禁例”十五款，约满再续订时，条件更为苛虐后竟增至六十一款之多。
    禁例愈来愈苛毒，后来发展到，不但对中国工人有禁例，对中国游学者也一样有禁例。禁例是：一、“不准工读”，发现时驱逐回国。二、“非习高等学问者不许入境”。三、“必须预备始学至卒业时所需之费用”，否则不许入境。
    此外，还有很多限制华人入境的方法。如借口条款不符不准上岸，如借口待查置诸“木屋”，如硬指学生、商人为工人，如以防疫为口实等等。当时华工因此不得上岸，又无钱回国，被逼跳海的很多。即已入境，也仍有种种苛例，使不得自由。
    这样，使在美国的中国人，前后二十年间（1883年—1903年）就从三十万减到十万。
    光绪三十年（1904年），又是“北京条约”满期的时候，美人再度要求续订。在美国的中国人就发起了反对禁约运动。在旧金山中华会馆开会，要求中国政府力争，拒绝签订。接着国内也响应了起来，实行抵制美货。这就是当时的轰轰烈烈的反对美国华工禁约运动。
    二
    反美华工禁约运动发生在光绪乙巳年（1905年），美帝国主义对于华工的虐待，最早反映在文学艺术作品里的，是光绪八年（1882年）黄遵宪“人境庐诗草”里的“逐客篇”。但如果再向前追溯，还可以发现远在道光二十七年（1847年），诗人对于当时去美中国工人的不幸命运，就已经有了预见。在有名的反英诗篇“三元里”作者张维屏“松心诗集”癸集“草堂集”卷三里，就刊刻了反美的有关中国工人的最早史诗“金山篇”。根据那诗里反映的初期情况，已足说明几个问题：一、当时美帝国主义攫得巨额利润，而中国工人的待遇却很苦。二、在这时去的闽人粤人，还不过以万计，较之后来的二十万、三十万相差很远，初期的黄金时代待遇如此，后来也就更可想见了。三、新、旧金山的开创，中国工人献出了极大的劳动，美帝国主义却恩将仇报，最后竟把中国人无理驱逐。诗人对此极为反感，主张由国家兴办开矿、垦殖等事业，既能裕民，又可富国，所谓“因民利民自不费，富民富国原相连”。这和他“莫持崇俭为高论，欲济穷黎散富钱”（珠江），以民为本的精神是一致的。这是我国最早反对美帝国主义的声音。
    黄遵宪“逐客篇”作于“金山篇”后三十余年，这时中国工人的人数已达二十余万，矛盾已经扩大，禁例也已开始。诗里所反映的中国工人，为美国创造很大的财富，结果被限被逐的情况，真实而沉痛。但由于作者站在“洋务派”而又是外交官的立场，虽亦有爱国热情，终难免有所歪曲。另一个“洋务派”而又是名诗人的郑官应（陶斋），在《罗浮待鹤山房诗集》里，也有关于华工禁约的三题：《书抵制美国禁华人入口》、《哀黄人》、《沪上救生会同人曾君少卿来电云美国虐待华侨请告同胞以不用美货为抵制名曰拒约会赋此纪之》。在诗里，他指出在美华工，得不到中国政府的保护，所谓“华佣出外洋，政府无保恤”。而美帝国主义却“严禁不准来，苛刻例难述”，而且苛刻得无理，“因美虐华侨，苛刻无人理”。他肯定中国人民是爱国的，所谓“民志实可嘉”，希望能抵制到底：“上下争国体，主权守无失”。在《哀黄人》篇里，他说：
    ……慨自海禁开，招工来美国。出洋人日多，只为覔工食。大埠开金山，草莱辟荒?。黄人为经营，商务冠南北。岂料美政府，不以我为德。焚杀肆凶狼，灾患生不测。苛禁我华人，不容履彼国。……
    是更具体的指出美帝国主义的忘恩负义，和清政府的“有民不知保，驱而纳诸罭”。指出抵制运动起后，美帝国主义已很“震慑”，开始现出纸老虎原形，准备让步。无如清政府对美政府投降，中国大资产阶级和他们妥协，美国遂又强硬了起来。诗里反映了当时很多情况。至当时民气之旺，究竟到了什么程度，那正如名艺人汪笑侬（僢）在《闻拒约》一诗里所写：“一声怒吼睡狮醒，三载惊闻大鸟鸣。民气本来大可用，商权此后或能争”。他已开始预见到中国人民的巨大力量。中国人民不能容忍美帝国主义这样的忘恩负义，虐待华工。王维城的“新乐府”两章，莫等闲斋主人“国之仇”八章，都是充满了愤激控诉之情的好作品，“国之仇”八章南荃居士还曾选取收编到海侨春传奇中。这诗篇详细说明了当时中国处境之危，以及美帝国主义在当时就是我们的主要敌人，号召国人抵制美货，团结救国：
    国之仇！国之仇！国仇睒睒在何处？请君抉眼注视西半球。新旧金山累累未足饱欲壑，巨舌如箕乃欲痛舐吾华之膏油！吁嗟乎！国之仇！
    国之仇！国之仇！五都之市晶莹灿烂多仇货，遍告国民大索十日莫淹留。而今世界已无公理之可论，一见美人之物相率相弃投。吁嗟乎！国之仇！诗里还说到旅美中国人的被虐待“猘虎之牙，巨狼之爪，不扑杀我华人誓不休”的阴谋，诗写得悲愤沉痛。
    由于闽粤人在美最多，上海而外，闽粤方面运动的展开，也非常激烈。用地方语言写作的诗歌唱本很多。所见到最长的，有两卷本的抵制美国，上卷演唱中国工人在美被虐待情况，下卷宣传抵制美货。类似这样的唱本，在当时的影响是很大的。如海幢寺急口令、吊烟仔龙舟歌《华工诉恨》、《金山客叹五更》、《好孩儿》等，也都是传诵一时之作。
    三
    揭露美国政府迫害华工的小说，有“苦社会”初集四十八回。光绪三十一年（1905年）秋七月申报馆发行。
    “苦社会”内容，是一部很现实的华工血泪生活史，特别是第二十回以后，写中国人被虐待的苦况令人发指。所有反映这一方面的小说，写得最深刻、最惨痛的，要推这一部。
    书中叙述华工上船以后，即遭虐待，数千人被锁在舱里，窗门都被封闭，吃的是生硬馒头，且不得饱；疾病无人过问；鞭打链锁，时有所闻。
    我们读了这本书，就可以看到华工是生活在怎样一种暗无天日的地狱之中。在海行途中是如此，后来到地头，到工区，也同样如此。即如“工房，就是高处不到三尺深，阔处不到五尺，曲了身体进去，没有一张床，一张桌子，只在地下铺上一层稻草，脚踹时又湿又冷。……上面有椽没有瓦，薄薄的盖些草。……每间要住四人，虽不算多，就只每人占地一尺二寸零。立哩，抬不起头；睡哩，伸不直脚。……”（第三十回）不仅这样，还要用铁索将四人连续锁起，屋外又放着马队巡行。
    第二部是“黄金世界”，分上下卷，碧荷馆主人著，1907年小说林刊行。本书开头写美国人如何利用汉奸工头拐骗贩买“猪仔”，以及工人在途中备受虐待，在“木屋”里的苦难等。并写到上海方面拒约的情形，又写了当地商学两界的冲突。部分资产阶级偷运美货、动摇妥协，美国政府胁迫清朝政府破坏反美运动，解散拒约组织，逮捕热心活动分子等等。一直写到有人想集合资本，振兴民族工业，由于得不到商人富豪的同情，终于失败。
    这部小说反映了当时在美中国工人的非人生活和反抗。我们今天在帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义摄制的电影上，经常可以看到有无数关在船上的奴隶，被一些赤膊浓须的凶横大汉，不住的用皮鞭抽打，他们喊叫、忍耐，舐着自己的伤痕，到忍无可忍的时候，便一起团结起来反抗。这本书里也有同样的描述。如写上了船的中国工人，出不起五钱银子的一顿饭钱，他们不得已，便用自己带的米煮一点稀汤。那知正在“渐渐水热，粥香外溢，大众正在流涎的时候”，竟被“连锅抛入海中”，“高举皮鞭，没头没脸，挨排打来”。类此描写很多，即此可见那时的黄金国家，是如何的虐待华工，把华工看得真是连猪狗都不如！其写“木屋”生活，较“苦社会”更为细致。
    第三部是“拒约奇谈”，中国凉血人著，光绪三十二年（1906年）启智书局版。反映在书里的作者主张，是抵制美货并非根本解决办法，最要紧的是先振兴自己国内的工商业。所以，他以叫做病夫的人物做中心，写他的根治办法，在拒约会中得不到拥护，便独自跑到个偏僻所在，进行购置机器，训练工人，兴办工厂，发展实业。至“拒约”问题，病夫也有和别人不同的意见：“不言抵制则可，苟言抵制，一劳必求永逸，非废‘例’不可。……‘例’一日不废，我同胞受辱必如前，受侮慢必如前。故仆窃划二策曰：内对于政府，当求不与美续约，以杜美人增‘例’之张本。外对于美国，当求其废
  ‘例’。非俟一切等‘例’解除，我抵制亦决不解”。他认为这“内言不续约，外言废例”，是最适当的办法。全书凡四万言，自署为“开智小说”。
    第四部是“苦学生”，十回，杞忧子著，连载于绣像小说（1905年），未出单行本。这书写一个苦学生在美国半工半读的经过。因他“半工”，美国竟“另定几件专待支那学生的新例”，说他“不应再做工人，限厂主于二十点钟内驱令出厂”。学校又借口他曾是工人，也把他赶出。他愤而去找中国公使，却遭到公使的申斥：“你闹到东被人撵，西被人赶，还不算是笑话么？咱本不爱管这事，你又使那教习赤紧的跟咱缠扰，你究竟打的什么主意？”书里揭露了这些黑暗，也写了两种美国人。另一种就是同情中国工人，支持勤工俭学的美国人，这在张荫桓的三洲日记里，也写到了这一方面。这是书里关于华工禁约部分的情况。
    第五部是“劫余灰”，十六回，吴沃尧（趼人）著，有月月小说本。书中叙述女主人公的丈夫被诱卖作“猪仔”以后，经历了千辛万苦。最后女的获救，男的也从美国逃了回来。
    在反华工禁约运动失败以后，美国兵部大臣达孚特从菲律宾来上海（1908年），当地绅商竟大开欢迎会。吴趼人看到这样情况，非常气愤，又写了短篇“人镜学社鬼哭传”，并署“南海吴趼人挥涕撰”字样。所以说“鬼哭传”，是因抵制事初起时，人镜学社社员冯夏威深恐运动不能坚持，乃自杀以激励国人。此篇即写欢迎会当夜之鬼哭，与上海绅商之无耻谄媚。虽文字写得并不好，但足见吴趼人愤激之情。此外，当时“小说月报”（商务印书馆刊）亦刊有哀华短篇“侨民泪”，许指严“猪仔还国记”，等。
    关于华工禁约的传奇，只见到南荃居士“海侨春”一册。全书卷数不详，先后所得皆为一、二卷，合订一册，凡十二出。广智书局发行，刊印年代未注明。全书以作者南荃居士及女侠遯云穿插其间，叙述反华工禁约运动主要情况。以新旧国魂的交替，激励国人反对华工禁约，奋发图强，愤激之情，跃然纸上。此剧至少还有两卷，没有写完或者印出。其他属于戏曲、曲艺范围的作品，青《二十世纪女界文明灯》弹词上卷第八出《拒约》，及班本《有心人卖扇》（明明作）、《拒约报》（陇西三郎作）、《生祭三志士》（风萍旧主作）等。从《有心人卖扇》篇里，可以知道当时的美术宣传工作，还有画反美折扇在街头叫卖的一种。
    此外，在散文和报章论文方面，抨击美帝国主义的“华工禁约”和暴露美帝虐待华工的文章，就更举不胜举了。
    从这些文字资料的简单回顾中，我们可以看出，美帝国主义早期的狰狞面孔，以及它所欠下的中国人民的血债，而中国人民一向也没有向美帝国主义屈服过，即使在那样困难的条件下，中国人民仍然开展了轰轰烈烈的反美华工禁约的斗争，用文艺形式揭露华工禁约，用实际行动抵制华工禁约，唤醒群众，进行反抗，因而，这些材料直到今天，仍然对我们有很大的教育作用。
