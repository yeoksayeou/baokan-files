Xinhua News Agency, 7th: Comrade Haxhi Lleshi, Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Albania, and other distinguished Albanian guests, accompanied by Vice Premier Xi Zhongxun and Vice Chairman Saifuddin, left Beijing by special plane this morning to visit Hangzhou, Shanghai, and other places.

Party and state leaders Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Chen Yi, Li Xiannian, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, and others went to the airport to see them off.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi delivered a warm farewell speech at the airport. He said: Respected Comrade Haxhi Lleshi, dear Albanian comrades:

Now our distinguished guests, Comrade Lleshi, Comrade Belishova, and other Albanian comrades are about to leave Beijing, and we are here to see you off with infinite reluctance.

Although your stay in our country has been short, this visit has further developed and strengthened the fraternal friendship between our two peoples. As Comrade Lleshi said, your visit has added a new cornerstone to the solid foundation of the eternal friendship between the Chinese and Albanian peoples.

Respected Comrade Lleshi and all the distinguished Albanian guests, at this moment of parting, please allow me, on behalf of the People's Republic of China and all the Chinese people, to once again express our heartfelt thanks to you for visiting our country and our people, and for bringing from afar the profound friendship of the Albanian people to the Chinese people. Please also convey the greetings and respect of the Chinese people to the fraternal Albanian people. We sincerely wish the Albanian people continuous and greater victories in the cause of building socialism and safeguarding world peace.

We wish you a safe journey!

Goodbye!

Chairman Haxhi Lleshi delivered a farewell speech. He said: Respected Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Respected Comrade Zhou Enlai, dear comrades, friends:

In order to continue to learn about the achievements of the fraternal Chinese people in the beautiful south of China, we are about to part. During our short stay, we have witnessed the life and tireless labor of the noble Chinese people. Wherever we went, whether it was a factory, a people's commune, or a cultural and social institution, we saw the high tide of creative labor enthusiasm of the 650 million Chinese people.

Profound friendship unites our two peoples. We are both members of the socialist camp headed by our common and loyal friend, the Soviet Union. The unbreakable unity of this camp increases our strength in victoriously building socialism and communism, and in the struggle against our common enemies—the aggressive imperialists and their lackeys, the Yugoslav revisionists. Our great and just cause—the cause of peace and socialism—will surely triumph. Our enemies will surely be completely defeated.

Comrades, thank you sincerely for the love and friendship you and all the Chinese people have shown to the Albanian people.

Long live the great Chinese people and the Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong!

Long live the People's Republic of China headed by Comrade Liu Shaoqi!

Long live the government of the People's Republic of China headed by Comrade Zhou Enlai!

Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Albanian and Chinese peoples!

Long live the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

Goodbye, dear comrades, brothers!

The speeches of Chairman Liu Shaoqi and Chairman Haxhi Lleshi were warmly welcomed.

After the Albanian guests arrived at the airport at 8:00 a.m., the band played the national anthems of Albania and China respectively. Chairman Haxhi Lleshi, accompanied by Chairman Liu Shaoqi, reviewed the guard of honor and accepted flowers from the Young Pioneers.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Premier Zhou Enlai, and others accompanied the distinguished guests to the plane. The plane carrying the distinguished guests took off at 8:30 a.m. The people who came to see them off waved continuously, wishing the distinguished guests a safe journey.

    列希主席离北京到杭州
    刘少奇周恩来等党和国家领导人到机场欢送
    新华社7日讯　阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国人民议会主席团主席哈奇·列希和阿尔巴尼亚的其他贵宾，由习仲勋副总理和赛福鼎副委员长陪同，在今天上午乘专机离开北京，前往杭州、上海等地参观访问。
    党和国家的领导人刘少奇、周恩来、陈毅、李先念、沈钧儒、郭沫若等，都到机场欢送。
    刘少奇主席在机场上致词热情地欢送贵宾。他说：敬爱的哈奇·列希同志，亲爱的阿尔巴尼亚同志们：
    现在我们的贵宾列希同志、贝利绍娃同志和其他阿尔巴尼亚同志们就要离开北京了，我们怀着无限惜别的心情来欢送你们。
    虽然你们在我国逗留的时间不长，但是通过这次访问，我们两国人民的兄弟友谊得到了进一步的发展和增强。正如列希同志所说，你们的访问，已经在中阿两国人民永恒友谊的坚固基础上，添上了一块新的基石。
    敬爱的列希同志和阿尔巴尼亚全体贵宾们，在这临别的时刻，请允许我代表中华人民共和国和全体中国人民，再一次向你们表示深切的谢意，感谢你们访问我们的国家和我国的人民，感谢你们远道带来了阿尔巴尼亚人民对中国人民的深厚友情，同时也请你们把中国人民的问候和敬意带给兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民。我们衷心地祝愿阿尔巴尼亚人民在建设社会主义和维护世界和平的事业中不断地获得更大的胜利。
    祝你们一路平安！
    再见！
    哈奇·列希主席致告别词。他说：尊敬的刘少奇同志，尊敬的周恩来同志，亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    为了到中国美丽的南方去继续了解兄弟的中国人民的成就，我们就要分别了。在短短的逗留期间内，我们亲眼看到了高尚的中国人民的生活和不倦的劳动。我们每到一个地方，不论是工厂、人民公社，还是文化社会机关，到处都看到六亿五千万中国人民创造性劳动热情的高涨。
    深厚的友情把我们两国人民连在一起。我们都是以我们共同的忠实的朋友——苏联为首的社会主义阵营的一员。这一阵营的牢不可破的团结增加了我们在胜利地建设社会主义和共产主义，在对我们的共同的敌人——侵略成性的帝国主义者和他们所豢养的走狗南斯拉夫修正主义者的斗争中的力量。我们的伟大的正义的事业——和平和社会主义事业必将胜利。我们的敌人必将遭到彻底的失败。
    同志们，衷心地感谢你们和全体中国人民对阿尔巴尼亚人民所表示的热爱和友谊。
    伟大的中国人民和以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党万岁！
    以刘少奇同志为首的中华人民共和国万岁！
    以周恩来同志为首的中华人民共和国政府万岁！
    阿中人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营万岁！
    再见了，亲爱的同志们、兄弟们！
