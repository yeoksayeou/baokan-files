Make Sports Better Serve Production
Representative of Shanghai Food Company Meat Processing Plant, Hao Mingcai

Under the leadership of the Party, all employees of our Shanghai Food Company Meat Processing Plant, while engaging in large-scale production and technological revolution, vigorously promote cultural revolution and vigorously develop mass sports activities, so that sports have taken root, blossomed, and borne fruit in our factory.

The Vigorous Development of Mass Sports

Before liberation, the employees of our factory suffered from weak constitutions and various diseases due to harsh working conditions. For example, the upper limbs of the hair-scraping workers were thick, and the lower limbs were thin; the slaughter workers suffered from inflammation of the joints of their limbs. The workers said, "Once you reach forty, don't even think about doing this job anymore." At that time, the capitalists only knew how to exploit the workers and did not care about the health of the employees at all. The whole factory only had a basketball team hired by the capitalist, and the vast number of employees had no chance to participate in sports. The workers said, "It's hard enough to get enough to eat and wear, let alone have the mood to engage in sports." After liberation, the nature of sports activities underwent a fundamental change, becoming a socialist cause to improve the physical and mental health of employees and serve labor production and national defense construction. Under the leadership of the Party, all 1,315 employees of the factory overcame difficulties such as a shortage of sports venues and a lack of sports equipment, and ensured that all those who could participate regularly participated in various sports activities. More than 180 sports teams and exercise groups were established, covering more than 50 sports. More than 80% of the factory's employees have reached various levels of the Labor and Defense System standards, and more than 50% have become ordinary shooters. Radio training for a thousand people is underway. The level of sports has also improved rapidly. In the district sports meet, the factory has won the first place in the men's overall score and the team championships in track and field, weightlifting, and swimming for two consecutive years. The tug-of-war team won the first place in the city sports meet. More than 250 athletes of different levels have emerged in the factory, and there have been two sports masters, two first-class athletes, and fifteen second-class athletes. Last year, a nautical all-around athlete participated in the National Games, and this year, two sports masters participated in the national competition, one of whom won the fourth place in the women's 50-kilometer cycling race.

Now our factory has basically done what the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao instructed: All that can be done should be encouraged to do gymnastics, play ball, run, climb mountains, swim, practice Tai Chi and various sports. Sports have become a necessity in the lives of employees and a new fashion in the factory. The employees said, "We have tasted the sweetness of physical exercise and deeply realized the benefits of sports for improving health and serving production." A worker wrote a poem saying, "Everyone goes to the sports field to temper their bodies into steel; improve your health to engage in production, and the indicators rise every day." Therefore, every morning, at the gate of the factory, on the nearby roads, and in the factory's courts and platforms, you can see crowds of people engaged in physical exercise. In the middle of the night, after the night shift workers get off work, some people still want to practice a set of Tai Chi before going home. Everyone has different hobbies for various sports activities. Among them, long-distance running is one of the most popular sports among the employees of the meat processing plant. In the 1958 district competition, the factory produced its first second-class "marathon" athlete – Wang Baosheng. Originally, everyone was superstitious about the "marathon," thinking that running dozens of kilometers at once would be too much to bear. Therefore, when Wang Baosheng came back from the competition, everyone surrounded him and asked him all sorts of questions. Later, many employees participated in long-distance running training. In 1958, when the city held the "marathon" competition in five districts and two bureaus, more than 200 people participated, including 78 from the meat processing plant. Now, more than 70 employees run 20 to 30 miles every day, and even more run dozens of kilometers two or three days a week.

The development of sports activities has greatly changed the employees' spare time and their mental outlook. In the past, most people went home after work; young men had nothing to do and wandered the streets, and some went to small restaurants to drink. These habits have now changed. For example, employee Fang A'gen used to drink almost every day, but since participating in sports activities, he has changed. He said, "After engaging in sports activities, I don't want to drink anymore. In the past, I felt uncomfortable all over if I didn't drink for a day, but now I feel uncomfortable all over if I don't run for a day." Older workers are getting younger and younger, and young workers are full of energy. Employee Huang Lianchang, although only 31 years old, was usually taciturn and showed no interest in cultural and sports activities. He was not energetic in his work and study either. Everyone said he was like an "eighty-year-old man." After participating in sports activities, his personality became cheerful, he became very active in meetings and studies, and he even got eighth place in the factory's recent cross-country race.

On the basis of the popularization of sports, the masses also have higher requirements for further improvement. In addition to participating in broadcast gymnastics, the vast number of employees actively and voluntarily participated in a variety of sports activities, and organized various sports teams and exercise groups. This has made mass sports activities regular and sustained, and promoted the continuous improvement of sports technical level. And the improvement of sports technical level has become a positive factor in promoting the vast number of employees to adhere to regular exercise. In the past, the level of sports technology in our factory was relatively low. Because all employees had an eager desire to accelerate the improvement of sports level, after several years of diligent study and hard training, now one out of every five employees in our factory is a national-level athlete. Our factory's female athlete Wu Xiangmei, from an ordinary female worker, quickly reached the standard of a female cycling master in just over half a year under the education and encouragement of the Party and her own diligent study and hard training. Wu Xiangmei only started cycling in the second half of 1958, and she is already the mother of three children. Some people started to worry about her when they heard that Wu Xiangmei wanted to strive to become a sports master. But Wu Xiangmei thought about something else. She didn't think about these difficulties, but rather about how to quickly improve her sports level and win honor for the whole factory and for the workers of Shanghai. She practiced with experienced athletes every morning. When others rode 20 kilometers, she rode 30 kilometers; when others practiced for two hours, she practiced for three hours, and insisted on exercising, finally reaching the standard of a master. When she participated in the national competition this year, due to lack of experience, she encountered some difficulties in the competition. At the beginning, she fell behind the athletes from other regions, but she thought that the workers in the factory were carrying out technological innovation with soaring enthusiasm, and that she was a representative of Shanghai athletes, and she had to be responsible to the people of Shanghai and maintain the honor of Shanghai athletes. The thought of catching up encouraged her, and she finally won the fourth place in the national competition.

Sports Champions on the Field, Pioneers in Labor Production

The sports activists and athletes in our factory have played a great role in production. The masses praised them as "sports champions on the field, pioneers in labor production." Sportsmen often rush to complete works of high labor intensity that ordinary workers can barely handle. We also plan to assign athletes to these jobs, using their strength to play a shock role in production. For example, the cold storage group's task of hanging pig slices is labor-intensive, so weightlifters are assigned to it. The masses said, "Athletes really can do it." Last year, we rushed to plant water hyacinths in the Pudong suburbs, more than 30 miles away from the factory. Because the road was narrow and it was inconvenient to transport by car, the factory organized 36 long-distance runners into shock teams, and successfully completed the heavy task. Because athletes fully played a leading and shock role in production, all departments competed to get athletes when arranging labor. The relationship between athletes and the masses is also very close. When there are competitions, the leaders and employees of the production team take the initiative to say: "We guarantee to complete the production tasks, and you guarantee to win the battle," and support the athletes to go out to compete. Before the competition, athletes often go to work early to try to get rid of miscellaneous work; after the competition, even if it is almost time to get off work, they have to come back to production.

Mobilizing the Masses to Overcome Difficulties

The sports activities in our factory did not start when all the conditions were in place. On the contrary, almost all the slaughter workers before liberation were uneducated, and the average age was relatively high. Most people had never participated in sports activities, let alone had any "guidance" or "coaches." But the difficulty is not here, the bigger difficulty is the lack of venues and equipment for sports activities. Our factory is four four-story slaughter buildings, one after another. There is only a small open space in the factory, which can install a basketball hoop. The employees said well: "The factory buildings were built by British imperialists before liberation. The imperialists and capitalists only knew how to exploit the workers and did not care about the health of the employees at all. They couldn't wait to not even build toilets, let alone sports fields." But it was under such conditions that we carried out sports activities in full swing. Material conditions are difficult, but they are overcome by the brilliance of the general line and the truth that the poorer you are, the more revolutionary you must be. We mobilized the masses, implemented the policy of running sports diligently and thriftily, made do with what we had, adapted to local conditions, and used roads as tracks. When it rained, we ran around the stove in the center of the bottom floor of the factory building; the stairs from the bottom floor to the fourth floor became a good place for female employees to practice "mountain climbing"; a sand pit was dug in the factory, which can be used for long jump and high jump; old quilts were laid on grass bags as cushions, and skill activities and somersaults were carried out on them; old tap water pipes and hard iron bars were erected at both ends of the wall to become single bars; the aisles and lanes between workshops were used as good places for tug-of-war; waste gears were used as barbells to practice weightlifting, and so on. Taking advantage of work hours, many people do not take the bus or take a few fewer stops to practice long-distance running. They said, "This can not only improve your health, but also reduce traffic congestion, and save transportation costs. It's really killing three birds with one stone." We also use the roads and walkways in the factory to hold sports meets, with events such as races, high jumps, long jumps, weightlifting, tug-of-war, table tennis, and chess. The most recent one had more than 700 participants. In this way, sports activities were carried out vigorously. From our factory's experience, it is proved that the development of sports activities must also implement the policy of walking on two legs, using indigenous methods, and engaging in mass movements on a large scale. As long as the masses themselves feel the need to participate in sports activities, then any difficulty can be solved in front of the masses.

Sports and Production are Closely Integrated

We firmly lead employees to carry out sports activities and closely integrate sports with production. The benefits of sports have been proven by countless examples in real life. Here are a few examples:

In the past, the employees of the cold storage group had to carry the slaughtered and scraped white meat back and forth. The workshop was hot and the warehouse was cold, with a large temperature difference. The white meat was greasy when carried on the body, so they had to take off their clothes and wear oilcloth clothing next to their skin. In this way, it was easy to catch a cold when working. Among the 144 employees in the group, 70 or 80 people often had colds and took sick leave, and labor arrangement became a big problem. The branch secretary thought hard but could not find a solution. One day, while chatting with an employee, an employee said: "Only athletes can bear this job." This sentence gave him great inspiration. After investigation, it was found that among all the employees in the group, only 30 or so were not sick very often, most of whom were athletes. Based on this situation, sports activities were vigorously carried out among the employees, and the employees actively responded. After a few months of exercise, the phenomenon of colds tended to disappear, more and more people participated in the activities, the absenteeism rate decreased, and there was also a surplus of labor. Originally, due to physical weakness, it was difficult to maintain production for one day, let alone engage in technological innovation after production. Now, this situation has also changed. When the Party organization mobilized employees to carry out technological innovation, change the method of carrying pigs, and proposed "installing track bars and using iron slides; using trolleys to transport white meat in and out of the warehouse," both innovations were fully realized in less than a month, greatly reducing the labor intensity of employees, improving working conditions, and saving labor. Now, the number of employees in the cold storage group has been reduced to 40.

Carrying out sports activities has also promoted the cultural learning of employees. Labor model Xie Gensheng's learning of culture is a vivid example. He is an employee in his 40s. He has been studying at a spare-time school for three years, but he is still in the first grade. It is always difficult for the teacher to help him recognize words. Since participating in physical exercise, his energy has become increasingly abundant, his cultural learning has progressed rapidly, and he has been promoted every year. Now he is a fourth-grade student.

In short, the many benefits brought by sports have made sports take root in our factory. To sum it up, it is: "Production needs sports, and sports are for production." Comparing 1957 with 1959, the incidence of disease decreased by more than 60%. More than half of the factory's technological innovation projects were done by athletes; athletes participated in almost every major innovation. More than half of the factory's rated production experts are also athletes.

In order to make sports more closely integrated with production and more conducive to enhancing the physical fitness of employees, the whole factory is now relying on employees to do production exercises on their own. In just a few days, seven sets have been compiled (one set for each work section).

Three Main Measures

Our factory has always strengthened leadership by taking the development of sports activities as "an important political task of the Party." The Party organizations at all levels in the factory can resolutely implement the Party Central Committee and the Municipal Party Committee's policy instructions on sports activities, adhere to putting politics in command, closely integrate with production and rely on the masses. Our main measures are:

1. Strengthen the Party's leadership over sports work, adhere to putting politics in command, and adhere to sports serving labor production and national defense construction. Our factory often publicizes the policies and tasks of sports activities based on the various ideological concerns of the masses about participating in sports activities, and conducts class education through recollection and comparison, as well as grasping some typical examples of the positive role of participating in sports activities in improving health, to improve the vast number of employees' understanding of the purpose and significance of sports activities, so that the Party's sports policy is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. We also attach great importance to strengthening the political and ideological education of athletes, commending advanced individuals, establishing role models, requiring athletes to be champions on the sports field, pioneers in production, and become examples of improving health and serving labor production, and making athletes a backbone force in developing sports activities.

While grasping political and ideological work, we have made in-depth and meticulous arrangements for employees to participate in sports activities. According to the principle of taking production as the key link and making comprehensive arrangements, sports are listed as a regular task, given certain conditions and time, and the development of activities is regularly checked and various difficulties that arise are resolved; according to the characteristics of production, the spirit of "practicing actively at ordinary times and not interrupting during busy times" is grasped to carry out activities. In this way, it is not only conducive to production, but also maintains regular exercise.

2. Adapt to local conditions, make do with what we have, and implement the policy of combining popularization and improvement, so that sports activities can be actively and regularly carried out. In terms of popularization, various sports activities are carried out according to the masses' voluntary, hobbies, and the possibility of venues, to meet the different needs of men, women, old and young. At the same time, according to the characteristics of production, workers are mobilized to compile production exercises themselves, so that it is not only based on the hobbies of the masses but also conducive to production. On the basis of popularization, we also seize the opportunity to continuously improve, so that the activities that have been carried out are consolidated regularly, and popularization is further promoted through improvement. In leading the development of sports activities, we have implemented the policy of adapting to local conditions, making do with what we have, and running sports diligently and thriftily. First of all, we must solve the various incorrect ideas such as sports cadres' greed for bigness, pursuit of "foreign" things, and "conditionism," rely on the masses, carry out sports activities according to existing conditions, adapting to people, time, and local conditions, and mobilize the masses to create various indigenous equipment themselves to solve various difficulties, so that sports activities can be vigorously carried out.

3. Rely on organizations at all levels and give full play to the role of sports activists. We realize that sports activities are a mass movement, and we must follow the mass line and rely on and give play to the role of organizations at all levels. In regular work, the Party branch mainly grasps the policies and guidelines and focuses on ideological work, and specific work is handled by the relevant organizations. In the activities, we strengthen the training and improvement of activists, so that they become a backbone force in developing sports activities. At present, in our factory, whether at the factory level, workshop, work section, or production team, there are a large number of activists responding to the Party's call and actively arranging various sports activities.

Our work still cannot meet the requirements of the Party and the masses, and there are still some shortcomings in our work. Through this conference, we will definitely seriously learn from the advanced experience of fraternal provinces and cities, hold high the red flag of the general line under the leadership of the Party, and with the continuous leap forward in production, closely combine with health work, so that sports work can achieve greater leap forward, and the physical fitness of employees can be universally enhanced, so as to make more contributions to improving labor productivity and building socialism.

    让体育更好地为生产服务
    上海市食品公司肉类加工厂代表　郝明才
    我们上海市食品公司肉类加工厂的全体职工，在党的领导下，在大搞生产、大搞技术革命的同时，大搞文化革命，大力开展群众性的体育运动，使体育运动在我们厂生了根，开了花，结了果。
  群众性体育运动蓬勃开展
    解放前，我们厂的职工，在恶劣的劳动条件下，造成体质虚弱，有各种疾病。如刮毛工人上肢粗，下肢细；屠宰工人四肢关节发炎。工人说：“到了四十岁，就别想再吃这行饭了。”那个时候，资本家只晓得剥削工人，根本谈不上关心职工的健康。全厂只有一个资本家雇佣的篮球队，广大职工是没有参加体育锻炼的份的。工人们说：“连吃饱、穿暖都有困难，那有心思搞体育。”解放以后，体育运动的性质发生了根本的变化，成为增进职工身心健康，为劳动生产和国防建设服务的社会主义事业。全厂一千三百一十五个职工，在党的领导下，克服了运动场地少、体育设备缺乏等困难，做到了凡是能够参加的都经常参加各种体育活动，建立了包括五十多个项目的一百八十余个运动队和锻炼小组，全厂已有80％以上的职工达到劳卫制各级标准，50％以上的职工成为普通射手，千人无线电训练正在进行。运动水平也有了迅速提高，在区运动会上连续两年获得男子总分第一和田径、举重、游泳三个项目的团体冠军，拔河曾在市运动会上得到第一名，全厂还涌现了二百五十多个等级运动员，并且出现了两个运动健将、两个一级运动员和十五个二级运动员。去年一个航海多项运动员参加了全国运动会，今年两个运动健将分别参加了全国比赛，其中一个获得女子自行车五十公里全国第四名。
    现在我们厂已基本上做到了党中央和毛主席的指示：凡能做到的，都要提倡做体操，打球，跑步，爬山，游水，打太极拳和各种各色的体育运动。体育运动在厂里已成为职工生活所必需，成为工厂的新风尚。职工们说：“我们已尝到了体育锻炼的甜头，深切地体会到体育对增进健康、为生产服务的好处。”有个工人作了一首诗说：“人人都上体育场，要把身体炼成钢；炼好身体搞生产，指标天天往上涨。”所以每天清晨，在工厂的大门口，在附近的马路上，在厂内球场、平台上，到处都可以看到进行体育锻炼的人群。半夜里，夜班职工下班了，还有人要打一套太极拳后再回家去。大家对各项体育活动都有不同的爱好。其中长跑是肉类加工厂职工最喜爱的项目之一。在1958年区的比赛中，工厂第一次出现了一个“马拉松”的二级运动员——王保生。原来大家对“马拉松”有迷信，认为一下子要跑几十公里，怎么吃得消。因此，当王保生比赛回来时，大家围着他问长问短。以后，很多职工参加了长跑锻炼。1958年市举办五区、两局“马拉松”比赛时，参加比赛的共两百余人，其中肉类加工厂就有七十八人。现在天天跑上二、三十里的职工已有七十多人，至于每周有两、三天跑几十公里的，那就更多了。
    体育活动的开展，使职工的业余生活、思想面貌起了很大变化。过去下班后，大多数人都回家去了；年轻小伙子们闲着没事，就溜大街，也有一部分人到小酒店去喝酒。这些风气，现在为之一变。如职工方阿根，过去几乎每天喝酒，自从参加体育活动后，就变了样。他说：“搞了体育活动，酒也不想喝了。过去一天不喝酒，浑身难过，现在一天不跑步，就觉得浑身不舒服。”老年工人越活越年轻，青年工人精神焕发。职工黄莲昌，虽只三十一岁，但平日沉默寡言，对文娱活动和体育活动一概不发生兴趣，工作、学习也不带劲，大家说他像“八十岁的老头子”。参加体育活动后，性格变得开朗了，开会、学习都很积极，并在最近工厂举办的越野赛跑中得到了第八名。
    在体育运动普及的基础上，群众也就有了进一步提高的要求。广大职工除了参加广播操外，积极主动地参加了多种多样的体育运动，组织了各种运动队和锻炼小组。这就使群众性体育运动经常持久的开展起来，促进了运动技术水平的不断提高。而运动技术水平的提高，又成为推动广大职工坚持经常锻炼的积极因素。过去，我厂的运动技术水平是比较低的，由于全体职工具有加速提高运动水平的殷切愿望，经过几年来的勤学苦练，现在我厂平均每五个职工中就有一个国家等级运动员。我厂的女运动员吴祥美，就是从一个普通女工，在半年多时间内，在党的教育与鼓励下，自己勤学苦练，迅速达到了女子自行车运动健将的标准。吴祥美1958年下半年才参加自行车运动，她已是三个孩子的妈妈。有些人开始听说吴祥美要争取当运动健将，为她着急。可是吴祥美想的是另一回事，她没有想这些困难，而是想如何迅速提高运动水平，为全厂、为上海工人争取荣誉。她每天清晨跟有经验的运动员一起练。人家骑二十公里，她骑三十公里；人家练习两小时，她练三小时，坚持锻炼，终于达到了健将标准。在今年参加全国比赛时，由于缺乏经验，在比赛中碰到了一些困难，开始时落在兄弟地区运动员后面，但她想到厂里工人正以冲天干劲在搞技术革新，又想到自己是代表上海市的运动员，要对上海人民负责，要保持上海运动员的荣誉，赶上去的思想鼓励着她，终于获得了全国比赛的第四名。
    运动场上的健将  劳动生产的闯将
    我们厂里的体育积极分子和运动员，在生产上起了很大的作用。群众称赞他们是：“运动场上的健将，劳动生产的闯将”，凡是劳动强度高的，一般工人力难胜任的工作，常常由运动员抢着去完成。我们也有计划地将运动员分配到这些工作岗位上，发挥他们身强体壮在生产中的突击作用。如冷藏组挂猪片工作，劳动强度大，就分派举重运动员去担任。群众说：“到底是运动员行。”去年，在离厂三十多里的浦东郊区突击种植水浮莲，因为道路狭窄，汽车运输不便，厂里就将三十六个长跑运动员组织成突击队员，顺利地完成了繁重的任务。由于运动员在生产上充分发挥了带头和突击作用，因此在安排劳动力时，凡是运动员，各部门都争着要，运动员与群众的关系也非常密切，遇有比赛，生产小组的领导与职工都主动提出：“我们保证完成生产任务，你们保证打胜仗”，支持运动员出去比赛。而运动员在比赛前，也往往提前上班，争取把杂务工作做掉；比赛后，即便是快要下班了，也要回来生产。
    发动群众战胜困难
    我厂的体育运动并不是在什么条件都具备了的情况下开展起来的。恰恰相反，解放前的屠宰工人几乎都是没有文化的，平均年龄也较大，绝大部分人没有参加过体育活动，更谈不上有什么“指导”、“教练”了。但困难还不在这里，更困难的是没有体育活动的场地和设备。我们厂是四幢四层屠宰大楼，一幢接着一幢，全厂只有一块小空地，能安装一个篮球架。职工们说得好：“厂房是解放前英帝国主义建造的，帝国主义、资本家只知道剥削工人，根本不顾职工健康，恨不得连厕所都不造，那里还谈得到上体育场。”但就是在这样的条件下，我们却把体育活动开展得热火朝天。物质条件困难，被总路线的光芒，被越穷越要革命的真理战胜了。我们发动群众，贯彻勤俭办体育的方针，因陋就简，因地制宜，利用马路作跑道，下雨天，就围绕厂房底层中央的炉子周围跑；从厂房底层到四楼的楼梯，成为女职工练习“爬山”的好地方；在厂里挖了一个沙坑，就可跳远、跳高；草包铺上棉袄当垫子，就在这上面搞技巧活动，大翻跟斗；旧自来水管、硬杠棒搭在墙的两端，就是单杠；车间与车间之间的走道、弄堂，当作了拔河的好地方；利用废齿轮作杠铃，练习举重等等。利用上班时间，有很多人不乘车或者少乘几站车，练习长跑。他们说：“这样既能练好身体，又减少了车辆拥挤，还能节约车费，真是一举三得。”我们还利用马路和厂里的走道、弄堂举行运动会，有赛跑、跳高、跳远、举重、拔河、乒乓球、象棋等项目，最近一次参加者就有七百多人。就是这样，把体育运动蓬蓬勃勃地开展了起来。从我们厂的经验证明，开展体育运动也要贯彻两条腿走路的方针，土法上马，大搞群众运动。只要群众自己感到有参加体育运动的需要，那末随便什么困难都可以在群众面前迎刃而解。
    体育与生产紧密结合
    我们坚定地领导职工开展体育活动，把体育与生产紧密地结合起来。体育的好处，已为实际生活中无数事例所证明。这里，举几个例子：
    冷藏组职工，过去要将杀好刮净的白肉背来背去，车间热，仓库冷，温差很大；白肉背在身上，油腻很重，因此要将衣服脱光，贴身穿上油布衣。这样，工作时很容易感冒，全组一百四十四个职工，经常倒有七、八十人感冒和请病假，劳动力安排就成为一个大问题。支部书记苦思苦想，找不到解决的办法。一天，与职工闲谈，一个职工说：“我们这个工作，只有运动员才吃得消。”这句话，给予他很大启发，经过调查，发现全组职工中，不大生病的只有三十余人，其中绝大部分是运动员。据此情况，就大力在职工中开展体育活动，职工们积极响应了。经过几个月锻炼，感冒现象趋于消灭，参加活动的人越来越多，缺勤率降低了，劳动力也有余了。原来由于身体虚弱，一天生产也是勉强维持，谈不上生产之余，从事技术革新。现在，这种情况也改变了。当党组织发动职工搞技术革新，改变背猪的办法，提出“装上轨道棒，利用铁滑杠；白肉进出仓，利用手推车”后，不到一个月，两项革新全部实现，大大减轻了职工的劳动强度，改善了劳动条件，节省了劳动力。现在，冷藏组职工已减为四十人。
    开展体育活动，也促进了职工的文化学习，劳动模范谢根生学文化就是一个生动的事例。他是一个四十余岁的职工，在业余学校里读了三年，仍旧是一年级，教师帮他认字总是很难记住。自从参加体育锻炼以后，精力日益充沛，学文化进步很快，年年升级，现在已是四年级学生了。
    总之，体育运动所带来的许许多多好处，使体育运动在我们厂里生了根。归结成一条，就是：“生产要体育，体育为生产”。以1957年与1959年作比较，发病率下降了60％以上。全厂的技术革新，有一半以上项目是运动员搞出来的；在每一项重大的革新中，几乎都有运动员参加。全厂评出来的生产能手，运动员也占一半以上。
    为了使体育更紧密的结合生产，更有利于增强职工的体质，最近，全厂正在依靠职工自己动手大搞生产操。在短短的几天里已编了七套（每个工段一套）。
    三项主要措施
    我们厂一向是把开展体育运动作为“党的一项重要的政治任务”去加强领导的。厂里的各级党组织都能坚决执行党中央和市委关于体育运动的方针指示，坚持政治挂帅，紧密结合生产和依靠群众。我们的主要措施是：
    一、加强党对体育工作的领导，坚持政治挂帅，坚持体育为劳动生产与国防建设服务。我们厂经常根据群众对参加体育运动的各种思想顾虑，大力宣传体育运动的方针任务，并通过回忆对比，进行阶级教育，以及抓紧一些参加体育运动后对增进健康起积极作用的典型事例，来提高广大职工对体育运动目的、意义的认识，使党的体育方针深入人心。我们又十分重视加强对运动员的政治思想教育，表扬先进，树立标兵，要求运动员在运动场上是健将，生产上当闯将，成为练好身体、为劳动生产服务的榜样，并使运动员成为开展体育运动中的骨干力量。
    我们在抓政治思想工作的同时，对职工参加体育活动，作了深入细致的安排。根据以生产为纲，全面安排的原则，将体育列为一项经常的工作，给以一定的条件和时间，经常检查开展活动的情况并解决产生的各种困难；又根据生产特点，掌握“平时积极练，忙时不间断”的精神来开展活动。这样，既有利于生产，又保持了经常的锻炼。
    二、因地制宜，因陋就简，贯彻普及与提高相结合的方针，使体育运动积极经常的开展起来。在普及方面，根据群众的自愿、爱好和场地条件的可能，开展多种多样的体育活动，以适应男女老少的不同需要。同时，根据生产的特点，发动工人自编生产操，做到既根据群众的爱好又有利于生产。在普及的基础上又抓紧不断提高，使已经开展起来的活动巩固经常，通过提高，进一步推动普及。在领导开展体育运动中，贯彻了因地制宜，因陋就简，勤俭办体育的方针。首先解决少数体育干部的贪大、图“洋”、“条件论”等各种不正确思想，依靠群众，根据现有条件，因人、因时、因地制宜地开展体育运动，并且发动群众自己动手创造各种土设备，解决各种困难，使体育运动蓬勃地开展起来。
    三、依靠各级组织，充分发挥体育积极分子的作用。我们认识到体育运动是一个群众性的运动，必须走群众路线，依靠和发挥各级组织的作用。在经常工作中，党总支主要抓方针、政策，抓思想，具体工作由各有关组织办理。并在活动中，加强对积极分子的培养和提高，使他们成为开展体育运动中的一支骨干力量。目前我们厂无论在厂级、工场、工段或生产小组都有大批积极分子响应党的号召，主动安排各项体育活动。
    我们的工作还不能适应党和群众的要求，工作中还存在着一些缺点。通过这次大会，我们一定认真学习各兄弟省、市的先进经验，在党的领导下，高举总路线红旗，随着生产不断跃进，密切结合卫生工作，使体育工作取得更大的跃进，使职工的体质普遍增强，更好地为提高劳动生产率，为建设社会主义作出更多的贡献。
