    In Memory of Comrade Bo Qu
    Dong Biwu
    When I was planning to visit Yungang in Datong, I heard the news of the passing of Elder Lin, and immediately ordered the car to return to Beijing. In the car, I composed a long poem to mourn him.
    The news from Datong struck like thunder,
    The fall of a star from the sky is truly lamentable.
    Among the Five Elders, you were the youngest,
    Why did fate hasten you to leave so early?
    The people's great leap forward requires you to join hands,
    Increased production needs your catalytic role.
    I will not go to Yungang to visit the stone Buddhas,
    I bring a bundle of fresh grass to offer my respects.

    悼伯渠同志
    董必武
    在大同拟游云冈，闻林老之丧，即命驾返京，车中为一长句吊之。
    大同闻耗若惊雷，
    星陨长空剧可哀。
    五老以君为最少，
    百年何事早相催？
    人民跃进应携手，
    生产提高要触媒。
    不去云冈参石佛，
    生刍一束我持来。
    一九六○年五月三十日
