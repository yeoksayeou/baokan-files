Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 10th: Zhejiang Province is vigorously engaged in the collection and comprehensive utilization of wild fibers. According to statistics from commercial departments, by the end of May, the province had purchased 200,950 dan of various wild fibers. Various regions have already used wild fibers as raw materials to produce more than 20 kinds of fabrics and more than 10 kinds of麻袋 (ma dai - sacks/gunny bags).

Since the beginning of this year, many counties in Zhejiang Province have established wild fiber offices and command centers. People's communes, following the principle of "taking grain as the key link and promoting all-round development," are simultaneously focusing on high-yield fields and "mountains of treasures," mobilizing commune members to go up the mountains to find treasures, and launching a surge in the collection of wild fibers. The Dali Production Team of the Shangfang Commune in Qu County seized the gaps in agricultural production, with the branch secretary taking the lead in a short-term blitz, collecting more than 1,000 dan of wild fibers in eight days.

In order to utilize the collected wild fibers as quickly as possible, various regions have also mobilized the masses to engage in the indigenous processing of wild fibers. Twenty-seven wild fiber demonstration processing plants in counties such as Tonglu, Fenghua, and Longquan have created more than 20 indigenous methods, such as water soaking, steaming, and burying, breaking through the degumming barrier for wild fibers and processing more than 6,000 dan of various wild fibers.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an: The textile industry system in Shaanxi Province has widely experimented with using wild and miscellaneous fibers for spinning and weaving, and has achieved great results. At present, textile factories across the province have utilized more than 30 kinds of wild and miscellaneous fibers, such as cotton stalk bark, *Lygeum spartum* (龙须草 - long xu cao), flax skin, and various waste cotton scraps, to produce more than 100 batches of different yarn counts and have test-woven more than 20 kinds of inexpensive white cloth, printed cloth, and colored cloth.

Shaanxi Province is rich in wild and miscellaneous fiber resources. According to preliminary surveys, it is estimated that there are more than 100 kinds of fiber plants in the province that can be used as textile raw materials. In order to make extensive use of these wild and miscellaneous fibers for spinning and weaving, large cotton textile factories in Shaanxi Province have designated special personnel and fixed looms for experimentation. They have overcome various technical and equipment difficulties and are now able to weave a variety of fabrics blended with wild and miscellaneous fibers, which are both strong and low in cost.

In order to further utilize wild and miscellaneous fibers for spinning and weaving, the Provincial Department of Commerce's Agricultural Products Trade Bureau and other units have recently dispatched 350 people to various counties to assist the counties and communes in conducting surveys of wild and miscellaneous fibers and planning for factory construction, and to help various regions train technical personnel in order to better collect wild fibers.

This newspaper reports: The Luoyang Prefecture in Henan Province has launched a mass campaign to produce one million meters of woven goods from wild and miscellaneous fibers. As of early May, the region had purchased a total of 840,000 jin of cotton stalk bark. Cities and counties such as Mengjin, Songxian, Lintun, Luoyang, and Yanshi have broken through the technical barriers of degumming, spinning, and weaving cotton stalk bark, processing more than 28,000 jin of cotton stalk bark fiber, and weaving coarse and fine canvas, as well as printed cotton cloth and麻袋 (ma dai - sacks/gunny bags), and using these fiber fabrics to make replicas such as handbags, schoolbags, bicycle seat cushions, etc., with good quality.

    浙江收购野生纤维二十万担
    陕西三百多商业人员下乡培养技术人员
    洛阳专区开展采集、利用野杂纤维运动
    本报杭州10日电　浙江省各地大搞野生纤维的采集和综合利用。据商业部门统计，到5月底止，全省已收购各种野生纤维二十万零九千五百担。各地已用野生纤维作原料生产出二十多种布匹、十多种麻袋。
    今年以来，浙江省许多县都成立了野生纤维办公室、指挥部；各人民公社根据“以粮为纲，全面发展”的方针，一手抓千斤田，一手抓万宝山，发动社员上山找宝，掀起了采集野生纤维的热潮。衢县上方公社大力生产队抓住农业生产间隙，支书挂帅，短期突击，八天就采集了野生纤维一千多担。
    为了把已经采集的野生纤维尽快地利用起来，各地还发动群众大搞野生纤维的土法加工。桐庐、奉化、龙泉等县二十七个野生纤维示范加工场，创造水浸、蒸煮、土埋等二十多种土办法，大破野生纤维脱胶关，已加工处理各种野生纤维六千多担。
    据新华社西安电　陕西省纺织工业系统广泛试用野杂纤维纺纱织布，已经取得了很大成绩。目前，全省各纺织厂已经利用棉秆皮、龙须草、胡麻皮和各种废棉下脚等三十多种野杂纤维，生产出不同纱支一百多件，并且试织出二十多种物美价廉的白布、花布和色布。
    陕西省野杂纤维资源丰富。据初步普查估计，全省能够用作纺织原料的纤维植物，就有一百多种。为了大量利用这些野杂纤维纺纱织布，陕西省的大型棉纺织厂都指定了专人、固定了专机台进行试验。他们克服了种种技术和设备上的困难，现在已能织出多种野杂纤维混纺的布匹，既坚牢，成本又低。
    为了进一步利用野杂纤维纺纱织布，最近省商业厅农产品贸易局等单位，还抽调出三百五十人分赴各县，协助县、社进行野杂纤维的普查、和作建厂规划，并且帮助各地培养技术人员，以便更好地采集野生纤维。
    本报讯　河南省洛阳专区掀起了一个群众性的大搞百万米野杂纤维织品运动。截至5月上旬，全区共收购棉秆皮八十四万斤。孟津、嵩县、临沌、洛阳、偃师等市、县已突破棉秆皮脱胶、纺纱、织成技术关，加工出棉秆皮纤维二万八千多斤，织成了粗、细帆布和花色棉布、麻袋，并用这些纤维织品制成手提包，书包，自行车垫座毯子等复制品，质量良好。（附图片）
