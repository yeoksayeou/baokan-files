Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 24th: Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai met with the Japanese literary delegation headed by Hiroshi Noma in Shanghai on June 21st and engaged in cordial conversations in a friendly atmosphere.

Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out that the victorious struggle of the Japanese people against U.S. imperialism and its agents in Japan, and for national independence and democratic freedom, is a great support to the struggle of the Chinese people and the people of the world against U.S. imperialist aggression and in defense of world peace. Chairman Mao said that compared with previous years, the Japanese people's awareness has greatly improved. Now the broad masses of the Japanese people realize that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the people of China and Japan, as well as all peace-loving and justice-upholding people around the world. This struggle, in terms of its scale, scope, and duration, is unprecedented. It seems that the Japanese people have found a good way to oppose the new "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty," oppose U.S. military bases, and drive out U.S. imperialist aggressive forces under the current circumstances, which is to unite all forces except U.S. imperialism and its agents, and wage a nationwide mass struggle against U.S. imperialism and its agents.

Head of the delegation Hiroshi Noma said that the nationwide general strike on June 4th, involving millions of Japanese people centered around workers, marked a new stage in the Japanese people's struggle for independence and democracy. The forces of the Japanese people against U.S. imperialism and its agents in Japan have united, and this struggle will never stop; it will continue to advance and develop.

Chairman Mao further said that he does not believe that a great nation like Japan will be ruled by foreigners for a long time. He believes that Japan's independence and freedom are very promising. The abolition of the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" and the removal of U.S. military bases will guarantee Japan's independence and peace.

Chairman Mao pointed out that victory is achieved step by step, and the people's awareness is also gradually raised. Chairman Mao congratulated the Japanese people on achieving greater victories in the anti-U.S. patriotic and just struggle. Chairman Mao expressed his respect for the heroic sacrifice of Michiko Kanba. He said that Michiko Kanba has become a world-renowned Japanese national heroine.

Finally, Head of the delegation Hiroshi Noma and all members of the delegation expressed their heartfelt gratitude and joy for the great support given by Chairman Mao and the Chinese people to the Japanese people.

    在上海接见以野间宏为首的日本文学家代表团并进行亲切交谈
    毛主席说：日本的独立和自由是很有希望的
    赞扬日本空前的持久的全民性群众斗争是反对美帝国主义及其代理人的好办法
    他说：不相信日本这样的民族会长期受外国统治。取消日美条约和美军基地，日本独立和和平就有保证
    新华社上海24日电　毛泽东主席、周恩来总理6月21日在上海接见了以野间宏为首的日本文学家代表团，在友好的气氛中进行了亲切的交谈。
    毛泽东主席指出，日本人民反对美帝国主义及其在日本的代理人、要求民族独立和民主自由的胜利斗争，对于中国人民和世界人民反对美帝国主义侵略、维护世界和平的斗争是一个极大的支持。毛主席说，同前几年比较起来，日本人民的觉悟有了很大的提高，现在广大的日本人民群众都认识到美帝国主义是中日两国人民以及全世界爱好和平、主持正义的人民的共同敌人。这次斗争，从它的规模之大，范围之广以及持续时间之久说来，是以前难以设想的。看来，日本人民已经找到了一个在目前情况下反对新的“日美安全保障条约”、反对美国军事基地、赶走美帝国主义侵略势力的好办法，这就是团结一切除了美帝国主义及其代理人以外的最广泛的力量，对美帝国主义及其代理人进行全民性的群众斗争。
    野间宏团长说，6月4日以工人为中心的几百万日本人民参加的全国总罢工，标志着日本人民争取独立、民主的斗争已经进入了新的阶段。日本人民反对美帝国主义及其在日本的代理人的力量已经团结起来了，这个斗争绝不会停止，它将继续前进和发展。
    毛主席又说，他不相信，像日本这样伟大的民族会长期受外国人统治。他认为日本的独立和自由是很有希望的。取消“日美安全保障条约”，取消美国军事基地，日本的独立和和平就会有保证。
    毛主席指出，胜利是逐步得来的，群众的觉悟也是逐步提高的。毛主席祝贺日本人民在反美爱国正义斗争中取得更大的胜利。对于桦美智子的英勇牺牲，毛主席表示尊敬。他说，桦美智子已成全世界闻名的日本民族英雄。
    最后，野间宏团长和代表团全体团员对毛主席和中国人民给予日本人民的巨大支持表示衷心的感谢和喜悦。
