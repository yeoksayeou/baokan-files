    Advance in Victory, Fight to the End!
    By a Commentator of this Newspaper
    After being forced to postpone Eisenhower’s “visit” to Japan, the traitorous Kishi Nobusuke government of Japan is trying to launch a frantic counterattack against the Japanese people. On the one hand, it is trying its best to distort the truth and confuse right and wrong, viciously slandering and attacking the patriotic struggle of the Japanese people, and even openly clamoring that suppressing the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people "is Japan's top priority today." The Kishi Nobusuke government mobilized a large number of armed police to suddenly attack the masses participating in demonstrations in various places, and deployed fascist thugs to intensify their vicious attacks on people from all walks of life who insisted on anti-American and anti-Kishi struggles. These lackeys of the Kishi Nobusuke clique not only injured eleven professors and lecturers in Tokyo, and stabbed Kawakami Jotaro, a Socialist Party advisor who was delivering a speech to the demonstrators, but also created a new bloodshed incident in Fukuoka City, Kyushu. On the other hand, after the Kishi Nobusuke clique's conspiracy to forcibly vote in the House of Councillors to "pass" the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" failed due to the firm obstruction of Socialist Party members, it has brazenly decided to announce that the treaty "will automatically take effect" at zero hour on the 19th. Japanese militarism is desperately completing all the procedures required for "ratifying" the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, so as to exchange ratification documents with the U.S. government "as soon as possible." The United States is also taking corresponding steps to closely cooperate. As early as after Kishi Nobusuke announced the postponement of Eisenhower's visit to Japan, the United Press International of the United States openly threatened the Japanese people not to be "smug in victory," saying that "future developments may show that this is a victory that will cost a great price." The American monopoly capital group is exerting pressure from the economic front, saying that the Japanese political situation cannot but make people "worry," that Japan-U.S. economic relations will "gradually move in a bad direction," and threatening to squeeze out Japanese goods. Obviously, the United States is trying to drive its Japanese pawns to launch a frantic counterattack against the Japanese people and suppress the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people. The U.S. State Department clearly demanded that the U.S. Senate "discuss and approve the 'Security Treaty' according to the original plan, regardless of how the situation in Japan develops."
    This heinous activity of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, disregarding the strong opposition of the broad masses of the Japanese people and resorting to all means to impose the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty on the Japanese people, cannot but arouse great indignation among the Japanese people, prompting them to make persistent efforts and continue the struggle. Socialist Party members in the Japanese Diet occupied the entrance of the Special Committee on the "Security Treaty" for two days to prevent the Liberal Democratic Party from unilaterally "deliberating" the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty in the Special Committee, engaging in a struggle of strength, and finally forcing the Special Committee on the "Security Treaty" to be unable to hold a meeting. Universities across the country have gone on strike and held protest rallies and demonstrations. Yesterday, in order to protest the Kishi Nobusuke clique's illegal and forcible making the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty "automatically take effect," 300,000 angry workers, students, and people from all walks of life in Tokyo, including representatives from all over the country, launched an unprecedented unified action to "overthrow the Kishi cabinet, dissolve the Diet, and prevent the ratification of the Security Treaty."
    The Kishi Nobusuke government originally intended to use its forced postponement of Eisenhower's visit to Japan to ease the Japanese people's fighting mood and relax their fighting will. However, the broad masses of the Japanese people deeply understand that this decision made by the Kishi Nobusuke government is only a preliminary victory in their struggle to force the Kishi Nobusuke government to step down, force the Kishi Nobusuke government to dissolve the Diet, and oppose the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. In order to achieve the goal of crushing this treaty, they must advance in victory and continue to fight tenaciously. The Japan Socialist Party, in a statement issued on the 16th, already expressed that it "will continue to struggle until the Kishi Nobusuke government resigns, the Diet is dissolved, and the 'Security Treaty' is abolished." The Japanese Communist Party pointed out that in order for these goals to be achieved, the Japanese people must unswervingly struggle against the U.S. government and the Kishi Nobusuke government, which are trying their best to impose the Security Treaty on the Japanese people; "resolutely launch multifaceted struggles by the people of all strata in Japan, with a general strike of workers as its core." The Japanese "National Conference to Prevent the Revision of the Security Treaty" called on the Japanese people to launch unified actions, including a powerful general strike, on the basis of the victory achieved on the 16th, and continue the struggle to the end. The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan launched a one-hour workplace rally for all its affiliated unions' 3.6 million workers yesterday, which was actually a one-hour general strike. "Sohyo" also decided to launch a 24-hour national general strike on the 22nd, which is a powerful blow to the Kishi Nobusuke government and the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."
    The patriotic and progressive forces in Japan have used their practical actions to show their determination to unite closely, continue to advance on the basis of the victory in opposing Eisenhower's visit to Japan, and carry the struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty to the end. The decision of the patriotic and progressive forces in Japan undoubtedly conforms to the demands and interests of the broad masses of the Japanese people. Although the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries appear to be ferocious, they can be completely defeated in the face of united and conscious people, and under the continuous impact of the Japanese people's struggle. Yesterday, although the ruling Liberal Democratic Party passed a so-called resolution to "eliminate violence," plotting to expand the bloody suppression of the Japanese people's anti-American and anti-Kishi patriotic struggle, and although Kishi Nobusuke strongly stated that he would "go all out" to suppress the people, this does not indicate the strength of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. On the contrary, it precisely reflects that the Kishi Nobusuke government is increasingly at the end of its rope and is stubbornly carrying out a desperate struggle.
    Since the Japanese people have been able to successfully prevent Eisenhower's visit to Japan with united strength, we firmly believe that they will also be able to continue to inflict heavy blows on the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries until the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty is abolished.

    乘胜前进，斗争到底！
    本报评论员
    日本岸信介卖国政府在被迫推迟艾森豪威尔“访问”日本的计划之后，力图对日本人民发动疯狂的反扑。它一方面极力颠倒黑白、混淆是非，对日本人民的爱国斗争进行恶毒的诬蔑和攻击，甚至公开叫嚣，镇压日本人民的爱国正义斗争“是今天日本的当务之急”。岸信介政府调动大批武装警察，突然袭击各地参加示威的群众，并布置法西斯暴徒，变本加厉地对坚持反美反岸斗争的各界人士大下毒手。岸信介集团的这些爪牙不仅在东京打伤了十一名教授和讲师，刺伤了正在向示威群众发表演说的社会党顾问河上丈太郎，而且在九州的福冈市制造了新的流血事件。另一方面，岸信介集团在参议院强行表决“通过”新日美“安全条约”的阴谋，由于社会党议员的坚决阻止无法实现以后，已悍然决定在19日零时宣布这个条约“自然获得成立”。日本军国主义正在不顾一切地强行完成“批准”日美军事同盟条约所需的全部手续，以便于“尽可能早地”同美国政府互换批准书。而美国方面，也采取了相应的步骤，密切配合。美国的合众国际社早在岸信介宣布推迟艾森豪威尔访日以后，就公然威胁日本人民不要“在胜利中沾沾自喜”，“今后的事态发展可能表明这是一个要花很大代价的胜利”。美国的垄断资本集团从则经济方面施加压力，说什么日本的政局不能不使人“担心”，日美经济关系将“逐渐地走向恶劣的方向”，并以可能要排挤日货相威胁。显然，美国亟图驱使它的日本走卒，疯狂地对日本人民发动反扑，压制日本人民的爱国正义斗争。美国国务院则明白要求美国参议院，“不管日本局势发展如何，按照原定计划讨论和批准‘安全条约’”。
    美日反动派不顾广大日本人民的强烈反对，不择手段地把日美军事同盟条约强加到日本人民头上的这种罪恶活动，不能不激起日本人民极大的愤慨，促使他们再接再厉，继续斗争。日本社会党议员为阻止自由民主党在参议院“安全条约”特别委员会单独“审议”日美军事同盟条约，两天来占领了特别委员会的入口处，进行实力斗争，终于迫使“安全条约”特别委员会无法召开会议。全国各地大学纷纷罢课罢教，举行抗议集会和示威游行。昨天，为了抗议岸信介集团非法强使日美军事同盟条约获得“自然成立”，东京三十万愤怒的工人、学生和各界人民，包括来自全国各地的代表，展开了规模空前的争取“打倒岸内阁、解散国会、阻止批准安全条约”的统一行动。
    岸信介政府原企图利用它被迫推迟艾森豪威尔的访日计划，来缓和日本人民的斗争情绪，松弛日本人民的斗争意志。然而，广大日本人民深刻了解岸信介政府被迫做出的这个决定，还只是他们迫使岸信介政府下台、迫使岸信介政府解散国会和反对日美军事同盟条约这一斗争的初步胜利。为了实现粉碎这个条约的目标，他们还必须乘胜前进，再接再厉地顽强斗争下去。日本社会党在16日发表的声明中，已经表示它“将不断斗争下去，直到岸信介政府辞职、国会解散、‘安全条约’被废除”。日本共产党指出，为了使以上这些目的能够实现，日本人民必须坚持不渝地同竭力想把安全条约强加于日本人民的美国政府和岸信介政府进行斗争；“果敢地展开日本各阶层人民的多方面的斗争，而以工人总罢工为其核心”。日本“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”号召日本人民在16日取得的胜利的基础上展开包括强有力的总罢工在内的统一行动，继续斗争到底。日本工会总评议会已在昨天发动它所属的所有工会的三百六十万工人举行了一小时的工作场所大会，实际上就是举行一小时的总罢工。“总评”并且决定在22日发动全国二十四小时总罢工，这是给予岸信介政府和新日美“安全条约”以强有力的打击。
    日本爱国进步力量已经用自己的实际行动，表明他们决心紧密团结起来，在反对艾森豪威尔访日的胜利基础上继续前进，把反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争进行到底。日本爱国进步力量的决定，无疑是符合广大日本人民的要求和利益的。美日反动派尽管貌似凶恶，然而在团结起来的有觉悟的人民面前、在日本人民持续不断的斗争冲击下，是完全可以被战胜的。昨天，执政的自由民主党虽然通过了一项所谓“排除暴力”的决议，阴谋扩大对日本人民反美反岸的爱国斗争的血腥镇压，岸信介虽然强硬表示，他将“全力以赴”镇压人民，但这绝不表示日美反动派的强大。相反的，恰恰反映出岸信介政府越来越处于穷途末路，而一意孤行地进行着绝望的挣扎。
    日本人民既然已经能够以团结的力量，胜利地阻止艾森豪威尔的访日，我们坚信，他们也一定能够继续给予美日反动派以沉重的打击，直到废除日美军事同盟条约。
