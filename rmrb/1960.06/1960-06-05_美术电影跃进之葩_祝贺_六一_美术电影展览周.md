    Budding Splendor of Animated Film
    ——Congratulations on the “June 1st” Animated Film Exhibition Week　Cai Chusheng
    People always praise the animated films of recent years. This is no accident. Under the correct leadership and warm care of the Party, China's animated film industry has grown and developed at an extraordinary speed. The animated film garden, which had only a few small flowers several years ago, is now full of wonderful blossoms and abundant fruits. The "Animated Film Production Exhibition" held in Beijing at the beginning of this year exhibited a large number of excellent animated films, demonstrating the great achievements of the two years since the Great Leap Forward, and won unanimous praise from the broad masses of the audience and the literary and art circles. But in the blink of an eye, our animated film workers have once again contributed their excellent creations to this year's Children's Day.
    The animated films in this exhibition are very rich and colorful, both in terms of content and form. In terms of the content of the eleven animated films in the exhibition: there are "Sunny Spring," "Innovation Fanatic," and "Big Turnip," which sing the praises of the Great Leap Forward and the technological revolution; there are "Dove" and "Who Sings Best," which expose and satirize the enemy; and there are also beautiful fairy tales and folk legends "The Woodcutter Girl," "The Bee and the Earthworm," "The Monkey and Turtle Divide the Tree," and "Ji Gong Fights Crickets." The variety of forms has also increased. Not only are there the animated cartoons and puppet films that we are familiar with and the newly created paper-cut films, but also two brand-new forms of ink-wash animation and origami films have been created.
    Overall, China's animated films have two very distinct characteristics: first, they are closely integrated with current real life and educate children with communist ideology; second, in terms of form, they are striving to develop in the direction of nationalization.
    Our animated film workers are paying attention to the extraordinary new things and new people in the Great Leap Forward era in our country with incomparable concern, and are enthusiastically expressing the great ideals and soaring energy of the Chinese people. The animated film "Sunny Spring" uses the mythological genre to express the mythical reality of China today. The first spring of the 1960s is a spring of vigorous technological innovation, technological revolution, further conquest of nature, and a greater leap forward. The film uses symbolic images to comprehensively reflect the lofty aspirations and unparalleled strength of the 650 million working people of our country under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. "Innovation Fanatic" and "Big Turnip" sing the praises of the heroic figures who dare to create in technological innovation, and also humorously satirize those who have selfish and conservative ideas.
    These films attract the interests of young audiences to the hot reality of socialist construction, and educate the next generation with the new style, new ideas, and new moral qualities of breaking superstitions and daring to think and act. They have a clear ideological nature and a strong fighting spirit. This excellent feature of China's animated films should be firmly and unswervingly carried forward.
    While giving children a powerful positive education with the new people and new things in socialist construction, animated films have also produced some works that expose the enemy and strike at the enemy, which is very necessary. Artists not only use the image of the legendary four-legged wolf to educate children to hate evil forces, but also use the image of the "two-legged jackals" - the imperialists - in real life as "negative teachers" for young audiences. The puppet films "Dove" and "Who Sings Best" sharply reveal who is the enemy of peace and the true face of the so-called "golden yuan empire." These films educate children to hate imperialists, to hate the evil exploitative system, so as to love socialist society more and to love our happy new life.
    In terms of the nationalization and massification of films, the spirit of animated film workers who are diligent in research and courageous in innovation is very valuable. In the technological innovation movement, animated film workers have successfully combined China's traditional painting techniques with animation techniques, and created a new style of ink-wash animation with national characteristics. When we see the lively frogs, crabs, chicks, and grasshoppers under the pen of the famous Chinese painter Qi Baishi actually move and play their life stories, it is truly amazing! The ink-wash animation clip and origami film shown this time are still experimental works, but we can believe that after further research and exploration and continuous improvement by animated film workers, ink-wash animation and origami films will surely become novel styles that are loved by the broad masses of the audience (whether young, middle-aged, or old).
    In addition, several films with fairy tales and folk legends as themes, such as "The Bee and the Earthworm," in the exhibition week are also loved by children.
    Let us cheer for the holding of the Animated Film Exhibition Week, and wish the animated film workers to make persistent efforts on the existing basis, create better and more works, and achieve a greater leap forward! (Attached picture)

### 美术电影跃进之葩——祝贺“六一”美术电影展览周

    美术电影跃进之葩
    ——祝贺“六一”美术电影展览周　蔡楚生
    人们提到近几年的美术片，总是称赞不已。这不是偶然的。在党的正确领导与亲切关怀下，我国的美术电影以异乎寻常的速度成长与发展着，数年之前还只有寥寥几朵小花的美术电影园地里，如今已经奇葩满园、结实累累了。今年年初在北京举办的“美术电影制作展览会”曾展出大批优秀的美术片，显示出大跃进以来两年中的极大成就，获得了广大观众和文学艺术界的一致赞扬。但是转眼间，我们的美术电影工作者又以他们优异的创造贡献给今年的儿童节。
    这次展览的美术片不论是从内容或形式方面来看，都是十分充实而多彩的。从展览的十一部美术片的内容来说：有歌颂大跃进和技术革命的《艳阳春》《革新迷》《大萝卜》；有暴露、讽刺敌人的《鸽子》《谁唱得最好》；还有优美的童话和民间传说《砍柴姑娘》《蜜蜂与蚯蚓》《猴龟分树》《济公斗蟋蟀》。在形式方面花色品种也增多了，不但有我们所熟悉的动画片、木偶片和新创造的剪纸片，而且创造了水墨动画片和折纸片两种崭新的形式。
    总的看来，我国的美术片有两个十分鲜明的特点：第一，是密切结合当前现实生活，以共产主义思想教育儿童；第二，在形式方面，正努力向着民族化的方向发展。
    我们的美术电影工作者，以无比的关心在注意着我国大跃进时代中不平凡的新事物和新人物，满怀热情地表现出我国人民伟大的理想和冲天的干劲。动画片《艳阳春》就是用神话的体裁来表现我国今天神话般的现实的。六十年代第一个春天，是大闹技术革新、技术革命、进一步征服自然的、更大跃进的春天，影片以象征性的形象，概括性地反映了在共产党和毛主席的领导下，我国六亿五千万劳动人民的凌云壮志和无比的力量。《革新迷》和《大萝卜》，歌颂了技术革新中勇于创造的英雄人物，也幽默地嘲讽了有自私和保守思想的人们。
    这些影片把少年观众的志趣吸引到火热的社会主义建设的现实生活中来，用破除迷信、敢想敢干的新风格、新思想和新的道德品质教育下一代，它们具有鲜明的思想性和强烈的战斗性。我国美术电影的这一个优良的特点，应当坚定不移地继续发扬光大。
    美术片在用社会主义建设中的新人新事给儿童以有力的正面教育的同时，也制作了一些暴露敌人、打击敌人的作品，这是十分必要的。美术家们不但用传说中的四条腿的狼的形象教育儿童憎恨恶势力，而且也用现实生活中的“两条腿的豺狼”——帝国主义者的形象作为少年观众的“反面教员”。木偶片《鸽子》和《谁唱得最好》就尖锐地揭露出了谁是和平的敌人，和所谓“金元帝国”的真象。这些影片教育儿童憎恨帝国主义者，憎恨万恶的剥削制度，从而更加热爱社会主义社会，热爱我们的幸福的新生活。
    在电影的民族化与群众化方面，美术电影工作者勤于钻研、勇于革新创造的精神是十分可贵的。在技术革新运动中，美术电影工作者又成功地把我国传统的绘画技法和动画的手段结合起来，创造了水墨动画片这一富有民族特色的新样式。当我们看到著名国画家齐白石笔下的生意盎然的青蛙、螃蟹、鸡雏、蚱蜢居然活动起来，而且扮演着它们的生活故事，真叫人赞叹不已！这次放映的水墨动画片片断及折纸片尚是尝试性的作品，但我们可以相信，经过美术电影工作者进一步研究探索、精益求精，水墨动画片和折纸片必将成为新颖的、为广大观众（不论是少年、中年、老年观众）所喜闻乐见的新样式。
    此外，展览周中《蜜蜂与蚯蚓》等几部以童话和民间传说为题材的影片，也都受到少年儿童的喜爱。
    让我们欢呼美术电影展览周的举办，并预祝美术电影工作者在现有的基础上再接再厉，创造出更好更多的作品，实现更大的跃进！（附图片）
