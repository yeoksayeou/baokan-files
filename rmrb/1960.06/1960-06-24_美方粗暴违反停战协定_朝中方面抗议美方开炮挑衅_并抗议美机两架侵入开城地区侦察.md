Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 23rd. According to a Korean Central News Agency, Kaesong dispatch: At today's meeting of the secretaries of both sides of the Korean Military Armistice Commission, Senior Colonel Lin Giji, secretary of the Korean-Chinese side, protested the US side's shelling of the Korean-Chinese side's area near Hill 141 southwest of Munsan in the US side's area on June 18.

    The secretary of the Korean-Chinese side pointed out at the meeting that the US side's provocative shelling of the Korean-Chinese side rudely violated the armistice agreement. This is a dangerous game of fire that could lead to serious consequences and a challenge to peace.

    The secretary of the Korean-Chinese side demanded that the US side, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the armistice agreement, strictly punish the US personnel involved in this provocative act and report to the Military Armistice Commission.

    Faced with conclusive evidence, the US side had to admit this fact; however, in order to evade responsibility, they described this provocative act as a "stray shot" due to "inattention." The secretary of the Korean-Chinese side condemned this despicable tactic by the US side. He also pointed out that the US side must frankly admit its guilt and take responsible measures to ensure that such incidents do not happen again.

    At the meeting, the secretary of the Korean-Chinese side also protested to the US side about the violation of the armistice agreement on June 21, when two US F86 military jet aircraft intruded into the airspace over the Kaesong area for reconnaissance activities.

    美方粗暴违反停战协定
    朝中方面抗议美方开炮挑衅
    并抗议美机两架侵入开城地区侦察
    新华社平壤23日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社开城消息：朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中方面秘书长林箕济上校在今天举行的双方秘书长会议上，抗议美方6月18日在美方地区汶山西南一四一高地附近向朝中方面地区开炮。
    朝中方面秘书长在会上指出，美方向朝中方面挑衅地开炮，粗暴地违反了停战协定，这是可能招致严重后果的危险的玩火，也是对和平的挑战。
    朝中方面秘书长要求美方根据停战协定有关规定，严格处罚同这一挑衅行为有关的美方人员，并向军事停战委员会作报告。
    美方在确凿的罪证面前不得不承认这一事实；但为了逃避责任，竟把这一挑衅行为说成是什么由于“不注意”而发生的“走火”。朝中方面秘书长谴责了美方这种卑鄙的手法。他同时指出：美方必须坦率地承认自己的罪过，并采取负责措施保证此类事件不再发生。
    朝中方面秘书长在会上，还就6月21日美方F86型军用喷气式飞机两架侵入开城地区上空进行侦察活动的违反停战协定的事件，向美方提出了抗议。
