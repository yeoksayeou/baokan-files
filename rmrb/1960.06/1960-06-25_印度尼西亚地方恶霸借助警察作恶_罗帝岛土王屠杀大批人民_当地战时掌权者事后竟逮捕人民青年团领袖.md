Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 23rd – Antara News Agency reported that in mid-May this year, on Rote Island in Nusa Tenggara, an incident occurred where a local king, aided by armed police, massacred people who were demanding tax reductions. Dozens of people were killed, many were arrested, three villages were burned down, and many residents were forced to flee into the mountains.

According to Indonesian News Agency reports, after the massacre, the wartime authority in Kupang, the capital of East Nusa Tenggara, arrested several leaders of the People's Youth League in East Nusa Tenggara and ordered the People's Youth League there to "dissolve voluntarily."

The People's Youth League published a statement in today's Jakarta "People's Daily," expressing deep regret over the measures taken by the wartime authority in East Nusa Tenggara, and arguing that they violated the "Political Manifesto." The People's Youth League demanded that the central government take measures to safeguard democratic rights, restore the legitimate rights of the people in these areas, especially the legitimate rights of the people of East Nusa Tenggara.

The statement said that the People's Youth League will resolutely hold high the banner of struggle against local tyrants, because these tyrants oppress the people, especially the unbridled oppression of farmers.

    印度尼西亚地方恶霸借助警察作恶
    罗帝岛土王屠杀大批人民
    当地战时掌权者事后竟逮捕人民青年团领袖
    新华社雅加达23日电　据安塔拉通讯社报道，今年5月中旬，在努沙登加拉的罗帝岛上，曾经发生土王借助警察武装屠杀要求减轻捐税人民的事件。有几十个人被杀，许多人被捕，三个村庄被放火烧毁，许多居民被迫逃入山区。
    据印度尼西亚新闻社报道，在屠杀事件发生后，东努沙登加拉的首府古邦的战时掌权者逮捕了人民青年团在东努沙登加拉的若干领袖，并命令那里的人民青年团“自动解散”。
    人民青年团在今天的雅加达“人民日报”上发表声明，对东努沙登加拉战时掌权者的措施表示非常令人遗憾，并且认为违背“政治宣言”。人民青年团要求中央政府采取措施来保障民主权利，恢复这些地区的人民的合法权利，特别是东努沙登加拉人民的合法权利。
    声明说，人民青年团将坚决地高举反对地方恶霸的斗争的旗帜，因为这些恶霸压迫人民，特别是肆无忌惮地压迫农民。
