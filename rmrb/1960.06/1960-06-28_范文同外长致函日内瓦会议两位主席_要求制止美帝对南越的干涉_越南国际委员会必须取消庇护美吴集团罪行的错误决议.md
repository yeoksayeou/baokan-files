Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 27th: It was announced here today that Pham Van Dong, Foreign Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, wrote a letter on June 24th to Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko and British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, the two co-chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina.

The letter requests the two co-chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference to instruct the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Vietnam to reconsider and rescind its resolution regarding the permission for US military personnel to enter South Vietnam under the pretext of replacing military personnel of the French Expeditionary Force who had already withdrawn, and at the same time take measures to stop all interference by US imperialism in South Vietnam, to expel the American military organization called the "Military Assistance Advisory Group" from South Vietnam; to reconsider and rescind the Commission's resolution regarding Ordinance No. 10 of 1959 of the South Vietnamese authorities, and at the same time take measures to compel the South Vietnamese authorities to strictly implement Article 14(c) of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam, and to cease acts of retaliation and discrimination against former resistance members in South Vietnam.

The letter states that the Geneva Agreements on Vietnam are being seriously undermined due to the intensifying interference by US imperialism in South Vietnam. Vietnam remains divided, the democratic freedoms of the patriotic people of South Vietnam are being trampled upon, the independence and sovereignty of the Vietnamese nation are being seriously violated, and peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia is being seriously threatened. The letter reminds the two chairmen to pay attention to this situation and requests them to take measures to ensure the strict implementation of the Geneva Agreements in South Vietnam.

The letter points out that since the restoration of peace in Vietnam, US imperialism has continuously deepened its interference in South Vietnam, disregarding the basic principles stipulated in the Geneva Agreements. While shipping weapons and war materials into South Vietnam, the United States has also illegally maintained the military organization called the "Military Assistance Advisory Group."

The "Military Assistance Advisory Group" was originally an American military organization serving the French aggression against Vietnam. At the time of the armistice, this organization had 200 personnel, which has now increased to 2,000. During this period, the "Military Assistance Advisory Group" has also established many new agencies.

The letter emphasizes that recently, the US government and the South Vietnamese authorities openly reached an agreement to increase new American military personnel to the "Military Assistance Advisory Group" under the pretext of replacing French military personnel. Obviously, this is a blatant action in violation of the Geneva Agreements, and this action is part of the US plot to strengthen its war preparations in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

The letter then exposes a series of persecutions, massacres, and "sweeps" carried out by the South Vietnamese authorities against former resistance members in South Vietnam and people who love their country and love peace over the past few years, as well as the enactment of the fascist Ordinance No. 10 of 1959.

The letter states that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam regrets very much that the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Vietnam has not adopted a firm attitude and measures to stop this situation. The letter specifically mentions that the International Commission recently adopted a resolution by a majority vote, disregarding the strong opposition of the Polish representative, that the South Vietnamese authorities and the US government have the right to ship American military personnel to South Vietnam to strengthen the "Military Assistance Advisory Group," and that Ordinance No. 10 of 1959 of the South Vietnamese authorities is unrelated to Article 14(c) of the Geneva Agreements or any other articles. The letter emphasizes that the resolution allowing the shipment of American military personnel to South Vietnam violates the basic principles of the Geneva Agreements regarding the prevention of the recurrence of war. The International Commission has clearly exceeded its tasks and authority.

The letter further points out that these resolutions of the International Commission have created conditions for the United States to deepen its interference in South Vietnam in preparation for a new war, and have encouraged the South Vietnamese authorities to wantonly kill former resistance members and people who love their country and love peace in South Vietnam.

The letter says that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which has consistently respected and strictly implemented the Geneva Agreements, solemnly declares that it does not recognize the above-mentioned resolutions of the International Commission.

    范文同外长致函日内瓦会议两位主席
    要求制止美帝对南越的干涉
    越南国际委员会必须取消庇护美吴集团罪行的错误决议
    新华社河内27日电　这里今天公布了越南民主共和国外交部长范文同6月24日写给1954年关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议两位主席苏联外交部长葛罗米柯和英国外交大臣劳埃德的信。
    信中要求1954年日内瓦会议两位主席指示越南国际监督和监察委员会重新考虑和取消它关于允许美国军事人员以代替已经撤出的法国远征军的军事人员为名而进入南越的决议，同时采取措施停止美帝国主义对南越的一切干涉，把“军事援助顾问团”这个美国军事组织驱逐出南越；重新考虑和取消委员会关于南越当局的1959年第十号法令的决议，同时采取措施迫使南越当局严正履行关于停止越南敌对行动的协定的第十四条丙款，停止对南越的前抗战人员的报复和歧视行为。
    信中说，由于美帝国主义加紧对南越的干涉，关于越南的日内瓦协议正在受到严重的破坏。越南仍然被分裂，南越爱国人民的民主自由受到蹂躏，越南民族的独立和主权受到严重的侵犯，印度支那和东南亚的和平受到严重的威胁。信中提醒两位主席必须注意这种情况，并要求两位主席采取措施，保证在南越严正履行日内瓦协议。
    信中指出，自从越南和平恢复以来，美帝国主义不顾日内瓦协议规定的基本原则，不断地加深对南越的干涉。美国在向南越运进武器和战争物资的同时，还非法地维持
  “军事援助顾问团”这个军事组织。
  “军事援助顾问团”原来是为法国侵略越南服务的一个美国的军事组织。停战时，这个组织的人员有二百人，现在已经增加到两千人。在这一期间，“军事援助顾问团”还增设了许多新的机构。
    信中强调指出，最近，美国政府和南越当局公开达成协议，以取缔法国军事人员为借口，为“军事援助顾问团”增加新的美国军事人员。很显然，这是违反日内瓦协议的明目张胆的行动，这个行动是美国加强它在印度支那和东南亚的备战阴谋的一部分。
    信中接着揭露几年来南越当局对南越前抗战人员以及爱祖国、爱和平的人民所进行的一系列迫害、残杀、“扫荡”以及颁布1959年第十号法西斯法令的行为。
    信中说，越南民主共和国政府感到非常遗憾的是，越南国际监督和监察委员会没有采取坚决的态度和措施来制止这种情况。信中特别提到国际委员会最近不顾波兰代表的坚决反对，以多数票通过决议，认为南越当局和美国政府有权向南越运进美国军事人员来增强“军事援助顾问团”，并且认为南越当局的1959年第十号法令同日内瓦协议第十四条丙款以及任何其他条款毫不相关。信中强调指出，允许向南越运进美国军事人员的决议违反了日内瓦协议中关于防止战争再起的基本原则。国际委员会显然已经超越了它的任务和权限。
    信中进一步指出，越南国际委员会的这些决议为美国加深对南越的干涉以准备新的战争创造了条件，并且鼓励了南越当局大肆杀害南越前抗战人员和爱祖国、爱和平的人民的行为。
    信中说，始终不渝地尊重和严正履行日内瓦协议的越南民主共和国政府郑重宣布，它不承认国际委员会的上述决议。
