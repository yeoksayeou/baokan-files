Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 16th: The Japanese police's brutality of killing two protesting students yesterday has aroused anger among prominent Japanese figures towards the Kishida Nobusuke government.

    Socialist Party member Akira Kazami strongly condemned Kishida Nobusuke regarding the police's massacre of students. He said, "We cannot forgive this crime. Under no circumstances can we allow the government to kill the people. The Kishida Nobusuke cabinet should be overthrown."
    Poet Sumako Fukao said to Japanese reporters last night, "No matter what excuses Kishida Nobusuke uses to try to shirk his responsibility, it is Kishida Nobusuke who killed the sons and daughters of the Japanese people. It is natural for the students to oppose Kishida Nobusuke so angrily. It is only right that Kishida Nobusuke faces the people's anger towards him."
    She emphasized, "I firmly advocate that since Kishida Nobusuke's actions have caused such a tragedy, he should resign. If he continues to cling to power, even more tragic events will occur."
    She said, "These students sacrificed themselves to save democracy. We must continue the cause for which our sons and daughters sacrificed themselves. Now we must use all means to force Kishida Nobusuke to step down."

    谴责岸信介政府暴行
    据新华社16日讯　东京消息：日本警察昨天杀害两名示威学生的暴行引起了日本知名人士对岸信介政府的愤怒。
    社会党议员风见章就警察屠杀学生事件强烈谴责岸信介。他说，“我们不能原谅这种罪行。无论如何，我们不能允许政府杀害人民。应该推翻岸信介内阁。”
    女诗人深尾须磨子昨天晚上对日本记者说：“不管岸信介用什么借口来企图推卸他的责任，杀害日本人民的儿女的是岸信介。学生们这样愤怒地反对岸信介是自然的。岸信介面临人民对他的愤怒是理所当然的。”
    她强调说：“我坚决主张，既然岸信介的行动造成了这样的悲剧，他应该辞职。如果他仍抓住政权不放，一定会发生更多的惨案。”
    她说：“这些学生是为了拯救民主而牺牲的。我们必须继续我们的儿女为之牺牲的事业。现在我们必须运用一切手段来迫使岸信介下台。”
