Xinhua News Agency, 3rd dispatch: Yang Zhihua, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, spoke today at the National Conference of Advanced Workers in Culture and Education. In her speech, she first extended warm congratulations on behalf of the All-China Women's Federation to all the delegates present and, through them, to all the workers on the cultural and educational front. Then, she described the active participation of the broad masses of women in the cultural revolution and the technological revolution.

Yang Zhihua said that the broad masses of women in our country have actively responded to the call of the Party and have already made great achievements on the cultural and educational front. Tens of millions of working women have shaken off illiteracy and are actively participating in spare-time learning; the number of female students in secondary and higher education institutions has increased from more than 500,000 in 1951 to 3.47 million now. Under the leadership of the Party, Chinese women have, with strong determination, shaken off the cultural backwardness left over from the old society for thousands of years and are improving their cultural level at the fastest speed. The ranks of female educators are also constantly expanding. The number of pre-school childcare workers has reached more than 6 million, the vast majority of whom are women. In many areas, female primary school teachers account for more than 50% of the total number of primary school teachers. They constantly improve their ideological awareness, wholeheartedly serve the cause of children's education and childcare, carry forward the daring and capable communist style, strive to improve teaching standards, and actively engage in teaching reform in order to develop children's education and childcare in our country more, faster, better, and more economically. In scientific research departments, there are also more and more women workers. It is particularly gratifying that a large number of scientific and technological researchers and local experts have emerged from among the working women, who have played a significant role in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. The broad masses of women have universally participated in the patriotic health movement, becoming a main force in the mass movement to eliminate pests and diseases. Millions of women regularly participate in physical exercise, greatly improving the health of Chinese women. Among female employees alone, about 700,000 have reached the standards of graded athletes, and 26 female athletes have broken 8 world records 11 times. In literature, art, journalism, and publishing, not only are many women working very well, but also many working women are able to write poetry, paint, sing, and dance, giving full play to their literary and artistic creative talents. In this venue, there are 1,362 outstanding female representatives from the above-mentioned fields. The outstanding contributions of the broad masses of women to the cause of culture and education are a mirror of the great revolution and great development of culture and education in our country.

Yang Zhihua also spoke about the significant achievements that the broad masses of working women have made in adhering to diligent study of theory and Chairman Mao's works on the basis of improved cultural levels. She said: At present, according to incomplete statistics from eleven provinces and cities, the number of working women in urban and rural areas participating in the study of political theory has reached more than 13 million. In advanced areas, the number of women participating in the study has accounted for more than 70% of the total number of adult women. Among these women participating in theoretical study, there are not only ordinary young and middle-aged women, but also many mothers with many children and elderly women. Most of them have a low level of education, or have only just become literate. They have overcome many difficulties such as low cultural level, heavy housework, busy production, and tight time, and persisted in learning, thus achieving remarkable results, further improving their awareness, inspiring their wisdom, boosting their enthusiasm, and making their positions, viewpoints, and methods in production and work more correct. They are better able to stand firm in the class struggle, distinguish the direction, consciously defend the three red flags, and fight against bad people and bad things; and are able to break superstition, emancipate their minds, vigorously engage in technical innovation and technical revolution, and create high speed and new records; they further carry forward the communist style of unity, friendship, mutual assistance, and cooperation, without conditions, without regard to remuneration, and wholeheartedly serve socialism.

Yang Zhihua pointed out that the establishment of urban and rural people's communes has liberated women's labor force, helped women get rid of the constraints of children and housework, and created conditions for the broad masses of women to participate in labor and study, and to march towards science and culture. For this reason, it is required that everyone have a clear proletarian world outlook, treat this new communist thing with great enthusiasm, carry it forward, and mobilize 300 million women to play a greater role in the cultural movement. At the same time, she also pointed out that the work of childcare for pre-school children is an important aspect of the entire cultural revolution task. She hopes that workers in children's childcare organizations, medical institutions, and those engaged in literature, art, newspapers, magazines, films, radio, television, and other aspects will support the development of this cause, so that children can receive reasonable childcare from an early age, enhance their physique, and receive socialist and communist education from all aspects from an early age, so that children can become new communist people with all-round development of moral, intellectual, and physical education.

    三亿妇女投入文化革命
    杨之华在全国文教群英会上讲话
    新华社3日讯　全国妇联副主席杨之华今天在全国文教先进工作者代表大会上讲了话。在讲话中，她首先代表全国妇联向到会的全体代表并通过他们向文教战线上的全体工作者致以热烈的祝贺。接着，她叙述了广大妇女群众积极参加文化革命、技术革命的情况。
    杨之华说，我国广大妇女群众，积极地响应了党的号召，在文化教育战线上，已经做出了很大的成绩。几千万劳动妇女摆脱了文盲状态，并且积极参加了业余学习；在中等和高等学校的女学生，已经由1951年的五十多万人发展到现在的三百四十七万人。我国妇女在党的领导下以坚强的毅力，摆脱了千百年来旧社会遗留下来的文化落后状态，用最快的速度提高着自己的文化水平。女教育工作者的队伍也在不断扩大。学前儿童的保教人员，已经达到六百多万，其中绝大多数是妇女。不少地区小学女教师已经占到小学教师总数的50％以上。她们不断地提高思想觉悟，全心全意的为儿童的教育和保育事业服务；发扬了敢想敢干的共产主义风格，努力提高教学水平；积极地从事教学改革，争取多快好省地发展我国儿童教育和保育事业。在科学研究部门，妇女工作者也越来越多。特别值得高兴的是，在工农妇女群众中，已经涌现出来一大批科学技术研究人员和土专家，她们在技术革新和技术革命运动中起了很大的作用。广大妇女普遍地参加了爱国卫生运动，成为群众性的除害灭病运动中的一支主力军。千百万妇女经常参加体育锻炼，大大提高了我国妇女的健康水平，仅在女职工中就有七十万人左右达到了等级运动员的标准，还有二十六个女运动员先后十一次打破八项世界纪录。在文学、艺术、新闻、出版等方面，不仅有许多妇女工作得很出色，而且许多劳动妇女能诗会画，能歌会舞，发挥着文艺创作的才能。在这个会场上，就有一千三百六十二名上述各方面的优秀女代表。广大妇女在文化教育事业上的卓越贡献，是我国文教事业大革命、大发展的一面镜子。
    杨之华还谈到广大劳动妇女在文化水平提高的基础上，坚持刻苦学习理论，学习毛主席著作，已经取得了显著的成绩。她说：当前城市和农村的劳动妇女参加学习政治理论的人数，据十一个省市不完全的统计，已达一千三百多万人。在先进地区，妇女参加学习的人数已占成年妇女总数的70％以上。在这些参加理论学习的妇女中，不仅有一般的青壮年妇女，而且有不少多子女的母亲和老年妇女。大部分是文化水平不高，甚至是刚脱盲的。他们克服了文化低、家务重、生产忙、时间紧等重重困难，坚持学习，从而取得了显著的成绩，进一步提高了觉悟，启发了智慧，鼓舞了干劲，在生产和工作中立场、观点和方法更加正确，在阶级斗争中更能站稳立场，明辨方向，自觉地保卫三面红旗，同坏人坏事进行斗争；并且能够大破迷信，解放思想，大闹技术革新和技术革命，大创高速度和新纪录；更进一步地发扬团结、友爱、互助、协作的共产主义风格，不讲条件，不计报酬，全心全意为社会主义服务。
    杨之华指出：城乡人民公社的建立，解放了妇女劳动力，帮助妇女摆脱了孩子、家务等牵累，为广大妇女参加劳动和学习，为广大妇女向科学文化进军创造了条件。为此要求大家有一个明确的无产阶级世界观，以万分热情来对待这个共产主义的新生事物，使它发扬光大，把三亿妇女动员起来在文化运动中发挥更大力量。同时，她还指出学前儿童的保教工作，是整个文化革命任务中的一个重要方面。她希望在儿童保教组织、医疗机关的工作者和从事文学、艺术、报刊、电影、广播、电视等各方面的工作者，支持这个事业的发展，使儿童从小就能得到合理的保育，增强他们的体质；从小就从各方面受到社会主义、共产主义教育，使儿童成为德育、智育、体育全面发展的共产主义新人。
