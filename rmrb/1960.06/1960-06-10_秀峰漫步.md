Party Committee Secretary's Notes

    Strolling on Mount Xiu
    Jin Suxian, First Secretary of the Gutian County Committee of the Communist Party of China, Fujian Province

    In the early summer morning, it is still a bit chilly on Mount Xiu, which is 1,500 meters above sea level. I walked in the fields, a golden sea of wheat waves, like a roaring ocean. The rumbling sound of the water turbine driving the wheat threshing machine echoed through the valley. Male and female commune members were busy harvesting wheat, and a burst of singing came from afar:

    A sprig of osmanthus scents a thousand miles,
    Now Mount Xiu has undergone a great change,
    The people's commune shines brightly,
    Wheat ears grow like gold.
    Celebrating a bumper harvest in the leap forward year,
    Men and women, old and young, are filled with joy,
    Singing in unison for the Communist Party,
    The Communist Party is the red sun...

    The singing was crisp and melodious, it was female commune member Li Shujin singing loudly. Comrade Chen Xican, secretary of the Xiu Peak Brigade Party Branch, introduced to me: Li Shujin was an illiterate woman before liberation, after liberation she shed her illiteracy and entered a spare-time junior high school. She especially likes to sing, and everyone calls her the female singer.

    The Xiu Peak Brigade of the Daqiao People's Commune in Gutian County is a remote mountainous area with high mountains and cold water, scattered villages, and barren land. Before liberation, the lives of the masses here were extremely poor. Only one landlord's child in the entire brigade had attended junior high school, eleven wealthy middle peasant children had some basic literacy, and more than three hundred young adults were all illiterate. After liberation, this poor mountain area underwent tremendous changes, the lives of the peasants were greatly improved, and the demand for cultural learning became more and more urgent.

    In 1952, the township held literacy classes, and after eliminating illiteracy, they popularized spare-time elementary education with the spirit of continuous revolution. On the basis of popularizing higher primary education throughout the team, spare-time junior high school classes were also held. More than 85% of the commune members in the entire brigade attended spare-time junior high school classes. There were fifty-five families where all family members attended junior high school.

    I walked into the village, and it was a dazzling array, poems and paintings covering the walls. On the street's poetry journal, nearly a hundred poems were pasted on the whitewashed walls. Farmer Chen Hengsi wrote such a poem:

    Spring thunder brings more rain,
    The leap forward rings with new things,
    If raindrops were ink,
    New poems could never be finished.

    In the morning, the sun shone brightly in the sky, without a cloud in sight. Young farmer and excellent people's teacher Peng Quli, was busy inside and out sorting out the wheat that had been harvested. He let us sit in his small room for a while. Although the room was small, it was kept very tidy. The table was full of books and notebooks. I picked up a book and saw: Teaching Reference Book for the Second Volume of Industrial and Agricultural Spare-Time Junior High School Chinese. Party Branch Secretary Chen Xican told me that Comrade Peng Quli is now a people's teacher in junior high school. He used to be completely illiterate and learned everything after liberation. He often had to attend meetings after teaching every night, and after the meetings, he would go home to prepare lessons. He often worked until late at night, and he would read books whenever he had free time during the day. Whether going up the mountain or down to the field, he always had a book in his bag. His hard work enabled him to quickly improve his cultural level and teaching ability. People who used to ridicule him now respectfully call him Teacher Peng. In 1958, the Xiu Peak Brigade started a spare-time junior high school class, adopting the method of "a rising tide lifts all boats," with people's teachers and students upgrading together. Comrade Peng Quli became a junior high school teacher, which was no simple matter for him!

    At night, Xiu Peak sparkled with thousands of lights, like being inlaid with thousands of night-shining pearls. The entire brigade was boiling with a strong atmosphere of cultural learning. Commune members shook hands with each other at the entrance of the canteen to say goodbye. Male and female commune members attending junior high school classes and higher primary school classes walked in groups. Husband and wife learning models Chen Kongsi (Youth League Secretary) and Xu Meixiang (Women's Director) walked side by side in the front; sixty-year-old Grandmother Zhuo and her daughter-in-law also walked in the crowd with textbooks tucked under their arms. The music broadcast by the Daqiao Broadcasting Station seemed to be perfectly in sync with their steps.

    After a period of bustle, the people's school quieted down. I saw a female student in the cadre class answering the people's teacher's question. The people's teacher nodded in satisfaction and announced: All answers are correct, five points! Hey, which student has read the book so thoroughly? I took a clear look, and it turned out to be Comrade Wang Jinjiao, who had traveled thousands of miles on the cultural front. The old people of Gutian all say that she is "a cultural soldier of the Long March." Because her home is in Qidui Village—a natural village of Xiu Peak Brigade—which is four and a half li from Xiu Peak, she travels nine li back and forth every day, day after day for eight years. Calculated in this way, it is two thousand five hundred and forty li. At the conference of activists in the cultural and educational system held in the county, I heard her say: Once, after she finished class and reviewing her books at school, it was eleven o'clock at night when she returned to Qidui. As she was walking up the steep slope, she didn't know what kind of wild animal was staring at her with wide eyes, scaring her so much that she ran away, even dropping her schoolbag. Another time, the sky was so dark that you couldn't see your fingers. Suddenly, there was thunder and rain, blowing out her torch. She accidentally fell into the river. She didn't complain at all and crawled back home. Even when she was sick, she still had her schoolbag at her bedside. As the saying goes, "Where there's a will, there's a way." Now, she can not only read newspapers and do calculations, but I have also seen her articles such as "Hold High the Red Banner of the Cultural Revolution and Advance," "The Great Changes in Xiu Peak," and "The Rich and Colorful Cultural Life of Xiu Peak" published in the county newspaper.

    This Comrade Wang Jinjiao is not only a vanguard in cultural learning but also a hero on the production front. She is now the head of the pig farm and the deputy captain of the production brigade of Xiu Peak Brigade. Half a month ago, I went to her pig farm. She raised the pigs fat and strong. People say: Wang Jinjiao loves pigs like she loves her children, which is really true. When the pigs had a breathing sickness and wouldn't eat, she couldn't eat either. In order to cure the pigs, she ran to the commune veterinary station early in the morning and then to Zhuoyang Brigade to find local medicine, traveling more than eighty li back and forth in a day. In the people's school, she liked to read the story of pig raising model Liu Ziying the most. She knew that raising pigs should require a set of knowledge, so she actively studied. When the veterinarian came, she kept asking questions. Now, she has learned to give pigs vaccinations and understands more than a dozen kinds of local medicines for treating sick pigs and can handle the general diseases of pigs herself. Because she studies well and works well, she went to Beijing this time to participate in the National Conference of Outstanding Workers in Culture and Education.

    The next morning, Comrade Chen Xican, secretary of the Party branch, and I stepped on the undried white dew, passed through the high-yield fields of early rice and sweet potatoes, crossed the dense bamboo forest, and ascended to Paradise. Paradise is a small village in Xiu Peak, towering in the clouds. The sunshine warmly kisses this mountain village with fragrant flowers and singing birds. Herdsmen led cattle and sheep through the clouds, and newly planted fruit trees grew dark new leaves. The diligent masses of Xiu Peak are busy building a pastoral area here. Although it is high here, there is also a people's school that is evergreen in all seasons. Under the guidance of people's teacher Peng Quli, learning and production are well integrated. Now, they are using the book knowledge they have learned in production and have begun to carry out experiments such as grafting fruit trees and injecting glucose. In two or three years, this place will be full of flowers and fruits, and cattle and sheep will be in herds.

    Under the leadership of the Party, the hardworking and brave people of Xiu Peak are determined to build Xiu Peak into a true paradise on earth.

    秀峰漫步
    中共福建省古田县委第一书记　靳苏贤
    初夏的清晨，在海拔一千五百米的秀峰，还带点凉意。我走在田野上，一片金黄的麦浪，像滔滔大海。水轮机带动打麦机隆隆的声音，在山谷间震响。男女社员正在忙着收割小麦，远远传来一阵歌声：
    一枝桂花千里香，
    如今秀峰大变样，
    人民公社放光芒，
    麦穗长得黄金样。
    跃进年头庆丰收，
    男女老少喜洋洋，
    同声歌唱共产党，
    共产党是红太阳……。
    歌声清脆、悦耳，这是女社员李淑金在放声歌唱。秀峰大队党支部书记陈细灿同志向我介绍说：李淑金解放前是个一字不识的睁眼瞎，解放后她脱掉了文盲帽子，进了业余初中。她特别喜欢唱歌，大家都称她为女歌手。
    古田县大桥人民公社秀峰大队，是个山高水冷的偏僻山区，村落分散，土地贫瘠。解放前，这里群众的生活极端贫困，全大队只有一个地主孩子上过初中，十一个富裕中农子弟粗识些字，三百多个青壮年全是文盲。解放后，这个穷山岗起了巨大变化，农民的生活大大提高，学习文化的要求也越来越迫切了。
    1952年乡里就举办文化速成班，扫盲之后又以不断革命的精神，普及了业余初等教育。在全队普及高小的基础上，又举办了业余初中班。全大队社员念业余初中班的占85％以上。全家人都念初中的家庭就有五十五户。
    我走进村子，满目琳琅，诗画满墙。在街头的诗刊上有近百首诗歌贴在白粉墙上。农民陈亨四写了这样一首诗：
    春雷一动多雨水，
    跃进号响新事多，
    若把雨滴当墨水，
    也写不完新诗歌。
    上午艳阳当空，万里无云。青年农民、优秀民师彭曲梨，正忙着里里外外收拾着已割回来的麦子。他把我们让到他那小房间里坐了一会，房间虽然小，收拾得倒很整洁，桌子上堆满书和本子。我顺手拿出一本一看：工农业余初级中学语文二册教学参考书。党支书陈细灿同志告诉我，彭曲梨同志现在是初中的民师了。从前他一个字也不识，都是解放后学习的。他每天晚上教完书，常常还要开会，开完会回家就备课，经常工作到更深夜静还不算，白天一有空就看书。不论上山下地，他袋子里都少不了一本书。刻苦学习使他的文化水平和教学水平很快地提高了。过去曾讽刺过他的人，现在也尊敬地叫他彭老师了。1958年秀峰大队办起了业余初中班，采取了“水涨船高”，民师、学员齐升级的办法，彭曲梨同志便当上了初中教师，这对于他是多么不简单的事啊！
    夜来到秀峰，秀峰闪烁着千万盏灯光，像嵌上了千万颗夜明珠。全大队沸腾着学文化的浓厚气氛。社员们在食堂门口相互握手告别，上初中班的，上高小班的男女社员成群结伴地走了。夫妻学习模范陈孔思（团支部书记）和许妹香（妇女主任）并肩走在前头；六十多岁的卓老大娘和她的儿媳妇夹着课本也在人群中走着。大桥广播站播送的乐曲，好像和他们的步伐正好合拍。
    民校里热闹了一阵后肃静了。我看到干部班一个女学员在回答民师的提问，民师满意地点头示坐，并宣布：答的全对，五分！哎，哪个学员把书念的这么熟？我清楚地一看，原来是文化战线上踏过万里征途的王锦娇同志。古田的老百姓都说她是“万里长征的文化兵”。因为她家住企碓村——秀峰大队的自然村，距秀峰是四华里半，她八年如一日地每天往返走九华里，这样算起来便是二万五千零四十里的路了。在县里召开文教系统积极分子大会时，我听她说过：有一次，她在学校里上完课，温完书，回企碓是夜十一点钟了，当她正走上陡坡时，不知道一只叫什么的野兽向她直瞪大眼，吓得她连书包都跑掉了。又有一次，天空黑得伸手不见五指，霎时雷雨交加，把她的火把吹熄了，她不小心摔下了河，她一点也不叫苦，爬起来摸回家去。即使病了，床头还是放着书包。俗语说得好，“有志者事竟成”。现在她不仅能看报，会算账，在县报上我还看到登过她的“高举文化革命红旗前进”、“秀峰巨变”、“丰富多彩的秀峰文化生活”等文章。
    就是这个王锦娇同志，不仅是文化学习的尖兵，也是生产战线上的英雄，她现在是秀峰大队养猪场长和生产大队副大队长。半个月之前我到过她的养猪场。他把猪养得又肥又壮。人家都说：王锦娇爱猪如爱子，真是一点也不假。猪害喘气病的时候，猪不吃饲料，她也吃不进饭。为了治好猪病，她清早跑公社兽医站，又跑卓洋大队找土药，一天来回八十多里。在民校里她最喜欢念养猪模范刘紫英的事迹一课。她知道养猪应该有一套知识，于是就积极学习。兽医来了，她不停地问这问那。现在，她学会了给猪打防疫针，也懂得了十余种治病猪的土药，自己能处理猪的一般疾病。因为她学习好工作也好，这次上北京参加文教群英会去了。
    次晨，我和党支部书记陈细灿同志踏着未干的白露，通过早稻和地瓜的丰产片，越过茂密的毛竹林，登上了天堂。天堂是秀峰的一个小村，高屹在云端，阳光亲切地吻着这个花香鸟语的山庄。牧童?赶着牛羊踩云而过，一片新栽的果树长出黝黑的新叶。勤劳的秀峰群众，正忙着在这里建立一个牧区。这儿虽高，却也办着一所四季常青的民校，在民师彭曲梨的辅导下，学习和生产结合得很好。现在他们学到的书本知识用于生产，开始对果树进行嫁接和作葡萄糖注射等试验。二、三年后，这里将是花果满山，牛羊成群。
    勤劳勇敢的秀峰群众，决心在党的领导下，把秀峰建设成为人间真正的天堂。
