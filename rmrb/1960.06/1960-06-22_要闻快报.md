	A Good and Practical Way to Lead Production
	The CPC Tianjin Hedong District Committee has adopted the practice of the Secretariat and Standing Committee "moving" to factories to deeply lead production. Their specific method is that whichever factory the District Committee Secretariat or Standing Committee holds its meeting in, the standing committee members of that factory's Party Committee and relevant personnel are absorbed to participate. The District Committee, from on-site visits and listening to the factory Party Committee's reports, specifically analyzes and researches based on first-hand materials, and then makes resolutions that are implemented by the factory Party Committee. Such resolutions fit the actual conditions of the factory, concretize the Party's policies, and make the District Committee's leadership more vivid, concrete, and meticulous and solid.
