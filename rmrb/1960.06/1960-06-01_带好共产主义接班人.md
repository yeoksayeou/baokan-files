In My Position

    I am a girl from a peasant family. Since I was little, I helped my older sister take care of babies. From 1955, I herded cattle while studying. In the spring of 1956, I formally started school. In October 1958, under the situation of the Great Leap Forward, in order to further liberate women's labor force and develop production, the Party decided to vigorously run nurseries and kindergartens. The Party branch said at the meeting that they wanted to find a childcare worker who was both educated and good at taking care of children. After hearing this, I thought: During the Great Leap Forward in steel production and the battle of the three autumn harvests, I asked to participate, but the Party branch secretary said I was too young and didn't let me go. This time, when running the kindergarten, I must strive to be a childcare worker. I made a request to the Party branch, and the Party agreed. After accepting the task, I also considered that the children were young and didn't understand things, loved to cry and were difficult to coax, and that I was just a fourteen or fifteen-year-old girl, what if I messed it up? I was a little scared, but then I thought that I am a member of the Communist Youth League, and the Party often teaches me to have the spirit of overcoming difficulties, and to step up when I see difficulties, right? With the leadership of the Party and the support of the masses, what is there to be afraid of? So I became bolder.
    When we first started the kindergarten, there were no houses, utensils, or anything else. We really had nothing. The Party branch mobilized the masses to find solutions. I first mobilized my parents to vacate a room as a classroom; there was no blackboard, so I took the chopping board from the kitchen at home and made a blackboard; there were no tables or benches, so I took the wooden boards and door panels from my house and made three tables and three benches; there were no toys, so I made some toys out of mud and paper; there were no books, so I took time to go up the mountain to cut grass and sell it for five yuan to buy books; there was no ink or red ink, so I used burnt firewood to replace ink, and red clay water to replace red ink. In addition, with the enthusiastic help and support of the masses in various aspects, we started from scratch and established a kindergarten.
    After the children entered the kindergarten, how should I teach them? The Party branch helped me in time. According to the teachings of the Party branch, I took care of the children warmly, as if they were my own younger siblings. I not only taught the children to sing, dance, play games, and work, but also washed their faces, hands, heads, and bodies every day. If the children's clothes and socks were torn, I would mend them immediately. I also taught the children to be polite to people. Before long, the children became accustomed to life in the kindergarten, loved the kindergarten very much, and also loved me very much. Every day when they saw me, they would shout "Hello, Auntie" from afar and rush towards me. The parents were also very satisfied with the kindergarten.
    Seeing that the children usually looked at pictures and baby books, and often asked me when they saw words, and sometimes asked me to teach them words when they were tired of playing, and also that the parents hoped that the children would learn some words, I tried to teach the children to recognize numbers such as one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and ten in the kindergarten, and the children learned them quickly. Then, I used the method of looking at pictures to recognize words to teach them to recognize words. From the image in the picture, I inspired the children to master the pronunciation of the words, recognize the shape of the words, and understand the meaning of the words. Sometimes I brought real objects and taught by looking at them. This method was similar to recognizing words by looking at objects, and the children were very interested and easy to accept. After the children learned some words, I began to teach them to use chalk and write in large-character notebooks, and also taught them to sing, dance, and tell clapper tales.
    In order to cultivate the children's labor habits, cherish the fruits of labor, and foster a good quality of serving the collective, I led the children to plant pumpkins and cucumbers, pick wheat, beans, and acorn shells during the summer harvest, and engage in light labor. In addition, I used my spare time to create teaching aids for the children, such as "Hero Huang Jiguang Killing the Enemy" and more than ten others. The three minutes of rice I planted yielded 870 jin per mu, which also had a good influence on the children.
    The work I have done is still far from the requirements of the Party. The little achievement I have made is the result of the Party's education and help. The Party taught me not only to run the kindergarten in my village well, but also to set up kindergartens in the surrounding villages. I wrote a guarantee to the Party, stating that I would never give up until I succeeded. I climbed over mountains and ridges to more than 20 areas such as Yanjia Mountain, Yangpo, Dagou, Yue'er Bay, and Yangzhuang River to promote and mobilize the masses and introduce the experience of running kindergartens. With the support of the Party, the masses were quickly mobilized, and in three days, more than 20 kindergartens were set up, popularizing preschool education in the area.
    I have just started doing kindergarten work and have very little experience, but I believe that as long as I listen to the Party, learn humbly, and have drive, I will definitely be able to do my job well.

    带好共产主义接班人
    陕西洋县西水公社白龙管理区双庙生产队幼儿园教养员  黄翠娃
    我是一个农民家庭出身的女孩子，自小给姐姐抱娃娃，1955年起，一边放牛，一边学习，1956年春天，才正式上学。1958年10月，在大跃进的形势下，党为了进一步解放妇女劳动力，发展生产，决定大办托儿所和幼儿园，党支部在会上说要找一个既有文化又能带好孩子的教养员。我听了后想：大炼钢铁，大战三秋，我要求参加，党支书说我年龄小没让去，这次办幼儿园，自己一定争取做教养员。我向党支部提出了要求，党也答应了。我接受任务后，也考虑过孩子们小、不懂事，爱哭难哄，自己又是个十四、五岁的小姑娘，搞糟了咋办呢？又有些害怕，但一想自己是个共青团员，党不是经常教导自己要有克服困难的精神，见困难就上吗？有党的领导，有群众的支持，怕啥哩？胆子就大了起来。
    刚开始办幼儿园，房舍用具等等都没有，真是要啥没啥。党支部就发动群众想办法解决。我首先动员父母亲腾出了一间房子作教室；没有黑板，我就把家里厨房里的案板拿出来做了一副黑板；没有桌子、凳子，我就把家里的木板、门板拿出来做了三张桌子，三条凳子；没有玩具，我就用泥土、纸张做了些玩具；没有书本，我就抽空上山割草卖了五元钱买了书本；没有墨和红墨水，我就利用木柴熏烂代替墨，用红土水代替红墨水。再加上群众热情地从各方面帮助和支持，就这样白手起家建立起了一所幼儿园。
    孩子们入园后，怎么教导孩子们呢？党支部及时帮助了我。按照党支部的教导，我像对待亲弟妹一样，热情地照顾孩子们。我不但教孩子们唱歌、跳舞、游戏、劳动，还每天给孩子们洗脸、洗手、洗头、洗澡。孩子们衣服、鞋袜烂了，我也随即给他们缝补。还教孩子们对人有礼貌。没有多长时间，孩子们便过惯了园内的生活，非常爱幼儿园，也非常爱我，每天见着我，老远就喊“阿姨你好”，向我跟前扑来。家长对幼儿园也很满意。
    我见孩子们平时看画、看娃娃书，见到字常问我，有时玩腻了也要求我教字，况且家长也希望孩子们学些字，于是，我尝试着在幼儿园教孩子们认一二三四五六七八九十等数字，孩子们很快学会了。接着，我用看图识字的方法来教他们认字。从看图的形象，启发孩子们掌握字音，认识字形和懂得字的意思。有时候我拿来实物看着教，这种方法类同看物识字，孩子们兴趣很高，容易接受。孩子们学了一些字以后，我就开始教他们用粉笔，大字本学着写，同时也教孩子们唱歌，跳舞，说快板。
    为了培养孩子们的劳动习惯，爱护劳动果实及为集体服务的良好品质，我领导孩子们点种南瓜、黄瓜，夏收时拾麦、拾豆、拾橡壳，从事轻微劳动。另外我利用业余时间给孩子们创造教具“英雄黄继光杀敌”等十多种。我种的三分水稻，亩产达八百七十斤，也给孩子们很好影响。
    我所做的工作离党的要求还很远。我所取得的一点成绩是党的教育和帮助的结果。党教导我不仅要把本村幼儿园工作办好，而且也应该把周围各村都办起幼儿园。我向党写了保证书表示办不到决不罢休。我翻山越岭，到阎家山、阳坡、大沟，月儿湾、阳庄河等二十多个地区去宣传动员，发动群众，介绍办园经验。在党的支持下，群众很快地发动起来，干了三天，二十多个幼儿园就办了起来，普及了本地区的幼儿教育。
    我才学做幼儿园工作，经验很少，但我相信，只要听党的话，虚心学习，有干劲，一定能把工作做好。
