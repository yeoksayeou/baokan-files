Xinhua News Agency, 9th. Rubens Iscaro, Executive Committee Member of the World Federation of Trade Unions and Secretary-General of the Argentine Construction Workers Union, delivered a speech at the World Federation of Trade Unions Council meeting on the morning of June 6th.

    He said that advanced laborers should clearly know that peace can only be achieved through struggle. That is to say, today, more than ever, working people need to make their struggles—economic, social, and political—have clear anti-imperialist significance. Anti-imperialist struggle is the struggle for peace.

    In the context of escalating international tensions, and with imperialism intensifying its economic penetration policies, plunging millions of workers into hunger and despair, it is necessary to reaffirm the goals of the World Federation of Trade Unions and mobilize the full fighting power of the working class to oppose the main enemy: U.S. imperialism.

    He said that in Argentina, as in the whole of Latin America, hatred of colonial imperialism is growing. It must be pointed out that the broad masses have eliminated their fear of imperialism. When the masses' fear disappears, imperialism, as Mao Zedong said, is nothing more than an ordinary paper tiger in front of the masses. The Cuban people have seen this; their revolution not only overthrew the Batista dictatorship but also, and primarily, defeated U.S. imperialism. Therefore, it is conceivable that the Cuban revolution will face new aggression. Only the active mobilization and solidarity of the people and workers of Latin American countries can repel the forces of aggression. The democratic workers' organizations of our continent bear a major responsibility in this regard.

    He said that in the trade union movement, large-scale strikes have been launched in various Latin American countries. I would like to talk about the strike situation in Argentina since 1958, where economic demands are combined with anti-imperialist struggles. For example, the oil workers' union held a strike against granting oil concessions to American and British monopoly capital; the slaughter and refrigeration workers struck against selling the state-owned slaughter and refrigeration plants to imperialist capital; on September 23rd and 24th, 1959, four million workers held a general strike against the agreement with the International Monetary Fund; the metallurgical and textile workers' unions held strikes to defend national industry, directing the struggle against imperialist monopoly capital; the railway workers held a strike against the IMF's conspiracy to dismiss 60,000 workers; and bank employees held a strike against imperialism, forcing the government to reject its demands and oppose the implementation of the IMF-imposed policies of freezing wages, raising prices, mass layoffs, devaluing the currency, and stifling small industrialists.

    He said that it was these strikes, with increasingly strong anti-imperialist content, that forced the Frondizi surrender government to implement martial law and declare the strikes subversive, but it was unable to contain the proletarian struggle. In the high tide of the struggle, conditions for trade union solidarity and coordinated action were gradually created. He said that our line stipulates that in order to deal with the combined forces of imperialist monopolies and domestic big capital, it is necessary to organize a united workers' front, and provide material and moral assistance to striking workers and conduct sympathy strikes. We want to point out that a strike cannot merely be an act of dropping work and going home, but should take to the streets. From then on, the strike was no longer passive, but was followed by street marches and demonstrations. During 1959, not a single industry trade union failed to carry out a strike. There were four national general strikes between January and October, with approximately twelve million participants.

    He said that the solidarity of action in the trade union field is also reflected in the political field. In this regard, the consensus of various opposition parties in demanding the lifting of martial law, the release of political prisoners, and investigations into cases of torture, enabled them to hold a meeting attended by the Peronist Party, the Communist Party, the People's Radical Civic Union, the Socialist Party, the Christian Democratic Party, the Progressive Democratic Party, the workers' movement, and the student union. This situation can be considered the first budding of a national democratic front.

    Iscaro said that in most countries of Latin America, the conditions for cooperation between trade union forces, and then for the formation of a huge general union of the entire Latin America, are ripe. Latin American workers particularly need to coordinate their anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggles for rights. Our people in various countries see that the workers' solidarity of action (while expanding this solidarity to the entire Latin American proletariat) is the greatest guarantee for the victory of workers and people.

    He said that there is no doubt that this ideal of unity will increasingly take root in people's hearts, our camp will be strengthened day by day, and the imperialist camp will be weakened day by day, but we should still consider that we must attract the broad working class and the people to participate in the common struggle for peace, freedom, and economic well-being.

### 阿根廷建筑工会总书记伊斯卡罗发言强调  发动工人阶级全部战斗力  反对主要敌人美帝国主义  帝国主义在群众面前就像毛泽东所说的不过是一只纸老虎

    阿根廷建筑工会总书记伊斯卡罗发言强调
    发动工人阶级全部战斗力  反对主要敌人美帝国主义
    帝国主义在群众面前就像毛泽东所说的不过是一只纸老虎
    新华社9日讯　世界工联执行委员、阿根廷建筑工会总书记鲁本斯·伊斯卡罗6日上午在世界工联理事会会议上发了言。
    他说，先进的劳动者应该明确地知道，只有通过斗争才能获得和平。这就是说，今天劳动人民比以往任何时候都更加需要使他们的斗争——经济、社会和政治方面的斗争具有明显的反帝意义。反帝斗争就是争取和平的斗争。
    在国际紧张局势加剧的情况下，在帝国主义加紧执行经济渗透政策，使千千万万劳动者陷于饥饿和绝望的情况下，有必要重申世界工联的目标，发动工人阶级的全部战斗力，反对主要的敌人：美帝国主义。
    他说，在阿根廷，也像在整个拉丁美洲一样，仇恨殖民帝国主义的情绪日益高涨。必须指出，广大群众已经消除了对帝国主义的恐惧。当群众的恐惧消失以后，帝国主义在群众面前就像毛泽东所说那样，不过是一个平平常常的纸老虎。古巴人民就看到了这一点，他们的革命不仅推翻了巴蒂斯塔独裁者，而且主要是打败了美帝国主义。因此，可以推想，古巴革命会遭到新的侵略。只有拉丁美洲各国人民和劳动者积极动员起来表示声援，才能打退侵略势力。我们大陆的民主工人组织在这方面负有重大的责任。
    他说，在工会运动方面，拉丁美洲各国都展开了大规模的罢工。我想谈一谈阿根廷1958年以来的罢工情况，在那里经济要求是同反帝斗争结合起来的。例如石油工人工会就曾举行罢工，反对给予美国和英国垄断资本石油租让权；屠宰冷藏业工人罢工，反对把国营屠宰冷藏厂出卖给帝国主义资本；1959年9月23日和24日四百万劳动人民举行总罢工，反对同国际货币基金组织的协议；冶金业和纺织业工会举行罢工，保卫民族工业，把斗争方向指向帝国主义大垄断资本；铁路工人举行罢工，反对国际货币基金组织要求解雇六万工人的阴谋；银行职员举行罢工，反对帝国主义，迫使政府拒绝它的要求，反对在国内实行国际货币基金组织所强加的冻结工资、提高物价、大批解雇、使货币贬值和窒息小工业家的政策。
    他说，就是这些具有日益强烈的反帝内容的罢工，迫使弗朗迪西投降政府实行了戒严状态，宣称罢工具有颠复性，可是它没有能力遏止无产阶级的斗争。在斗争的高潮中，逐渐创造了工会团结和协同行动的条件。他说，我们的路线规定，要对付勾结在一起的帝国主义垄断组织和本国大资本的势力，必须组织工人统一阵线，在物质上和道义上援助罢工工人和举行同情罢工。我们要指出，罢工不能仅仅是一个扔掉工作不干和回家去的行动，而且应该到大街上去进行罢工。从那时起，罢工就不再是消极的了，而是继之以上街游行示威了。在1959年期间，没有一个行业工会没有进行过罢工。在1月到10月间举行了四次全国性的总罢工，参加人数约有一千二百万。
    他说，工会领域中的行动团结也反映在政治领域中。在这方面，各反对党在要求解除戒严状态、释放政治犯和对拷打犯人的情况进行调查方面的一致，使它们举行了一次有庇隆主义党、共产党、人民激进公民联盟、社会党、基督教民主党、进步民主党、工人运动和学生联合会参加的会议。这个情况可以认为是民族民主阵线的第一个萌芽。
    伊斯卡罗说，在拉丁美洲的大多数国家中，工会力量进行合作、然后再使这种合作形成整个拉丁美洲巨大的总工会的条件业已成熟。拉丁美洲的工人特别需要把他们的反帝国主义和反封建的争取权利的斗争配合起来。我们各国人民看到，工人的行动团结（同时要使这种团结扩大到整个拉丁美洲的无产阶级）是工人和人民取得胜利的最大保障。
    他说，毫无疑问，这种团结的理想将日益深入人心，我们的阵营日益加强，而帝国主义的阵营日益衰弱，但是我们仍然应当考虑到，我们必须吸引广大的劳动阶层和人民参加到为争取和平、自由和经济福利的共同斗争中去。
