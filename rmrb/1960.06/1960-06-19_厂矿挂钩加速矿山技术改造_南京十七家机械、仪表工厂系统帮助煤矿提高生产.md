　　Factory-Mine Hookup Accelerates Mine Technical Transformation
　　Seventeen Machinery and Instrument Factories in Nanjing Systematically Help Coal Mines Improve Production

　　(Our dispatch) Nanjing – Seventeen machinery and instrument factories in Nanjing are promoting a spirit of communist cooperation, and are paired with coal mines like Qinglongshan, Lingshan, Hushan, and Guantang to support the acceleration of technical transformation and promote increased coal production.

　　In the past, many factories in the city, in order to help coal mines improve their production capacity, had supported many necessary equipment. However, such support was generally conducted indirectly by accepting production tasks from the competent authorities. To provide more timely, practical, and comprehensive support, seventeen factories, including Nanjing Machine Tool Plant, under the leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, directly paired up with various coal mines. Each factory dispatched leading cadres, technicians, and skilled workers to form groups, who went deep into the mines to develop plans for further technical transformation. According to the plan, each factory will systematically and in stages manufacture equipment such as winches for mine hoisting, water pumps for drainage, and small mine cars for transportation, and will also help the mines establish machine repair workshops and train a group of machine repair workers to accelerate the technical transformation of coal mines.

　　Although the factory-mine hookup has only been going on for a little over half a month, it has already shown great advantages: First, it has further enhanced the consciousness and initiative of the factory workers to support the technical transformation of coal mines. After the representatives from each factory went deep into the coal mines, they saw the soaring enthusiasm of the coal miners and the monthly increase in coal production; at the same time, they also saw that in many places, production methods were still relatively backward, and they deeply felt the urgency and importance of supporting the technical transformation of coal mines. Seeing the weak machine repair force at Hushan Coal Mine and the impact on production when some equipment broke down and could not be quickly repaired, the Nanjing Machine Tool Plant representatives decided to immediately send a lathe to the mine. Second, support is more timely. In the past, some equipment needed by the mines had to be reported to many units and go through multiple approval procedures before being assigned to the factories. Now that they are directly linked, things are much faster. In the past, support tasks were assigned separately to each factory, and each factory was constrained by conditions and could not complete the task quickly. Now, several factories are jointly linked to one mine, jointly studying, assigning tasks face-to-face, and cooperating with each other, which can accelerate the completion of tasks. Third, on-site investigations make support more in line with the actual needs of the mines. Representatives from Nanjing Machine Tool Plant and other units investigated at Hushan Coal Mine and found that the electric drills used in the mine had large vibrations and the workers had high labor intensity. They decided to design a drilling machine that was more efficient and easier to use. They said, "If we hadn't gone down to the mine, we couldn't have thought as comprehensively and carefully as we do now." Fourth, it is easier for factories to help coal mines repair equipment and promote current production.

    厂矿挂钩加速矿山技术改造
    南京十七家机械、仪表工厂系统帮助煤矿提高生产
    本报讯　南京市十七家机械、仪表工厂发扬共产主义协作精神，和青龙山、灵山、湖山、官塘等煤矿对口挂钩，支援煤矿加速进行技术改造，促进煤炭增产。
    过去，这个市的许多工厂为了帮助煤矿提高生产能力，曾经支援了许多必要的设备。但是，那种支援一般都是从主管局接受生产任务，间接进行的。为了更加及时、更加切合实际、更加全面地进行支援，南京机床厂等十七家工厂，在市委的领导下，和各煤矿直接对口挂钩，各厂派出领导干部、技术人员、技术工人组成小组，分别深入到各矿制定进一步进行技术改造的规划。按照规划，各厂将有计划、有步骤地分期分批为各矿制造矿井提升用的绞车、排水用的水泵、运输用的小矿车等设备，并有计划地帮助各矿建立机修车间和培养一批机修工人等，以加速煤矿的技术改造。
    厂矿挂钩虽然只有半个多月的时间，但它已经显示出很大的优越性：首先，进一步提高了各厂职工支援煤矿技术改造的自觉性和主动性。各厂代表深入煤矿后，一方面看到煤矿工人干劲冲天，煤产量逐月上升；一方面也看到在不少地方，生产方法还比较落后，深深体会到支援煤矿技术改造的迫切性和重要意义。南京机床厂代表看到湖山煤矿机修力量薄弱，有的设备坏了不能很快修复，影响生产，决定马上送一台车床给这个矿。其次是支援更加及时。过去矿上需要的一些设备，要报请很多单位，经过多道批转手续，才能下达给各厂。现在直接挂钩，干起来就快得多了。过去，支援任务分别下达给各厂，各厂受着条件限制，不能很快完成任务，现在几个厂联合与一个矿挂钩，共同研究，当面分工，互相协作，可以加速完成任务。第三，上门调查，支援更加切合矿山实际需要。南京机床厂等单位代表在湖山煤矿调查，发现矿上使用的电钻震动大，工人劳动强度高，决定设计一种效率更高、使用更方便的钻机。他们说：“如果不下矿，就不可能想得像现在这样全面周到。”第四，便于各厂帮助煤矿检修设备，促进当前生产。
