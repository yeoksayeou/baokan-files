Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan. Hubei Province is actively preparing for flood prevention, drought prevention, flood control, and waterlogging prevention. "Four Prevention" command structures from the province to the county level have resumed operations.

Currently, mountainous and hilly areas are focusing on completing unfinished water conservancy projects, actively strengthening leadership, and conducting thorough inspections. Efforts are being made to ensure that each project safely navigates the flood season and fully leverages its irrigation benefits while ensuring project safety.

Along the Yangtze and Han Rivers, dikes are being reinforced, dangerous sections are being addressed, and various preparations are actively underway before the flood season. The riprap protection project for the Jingjiang Dike has completed nearly 70% of its plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou. Zhejiang Province is mobilizing the masses to conduct a comprehensive inspection of water conservancy projects and reinforce critical projects. A few unfinished projects are being rushed to completion.

Ideological work is being vigorously promoted in various localities to criticize the complacency of a few cadres and the masses. After the heavy rain in early June, Qingtian County immediately conducted a summary appraisal throughout the county, commending advanced units and individuals in flood prevention. Based on the summary appraisal, the masses were mobilized to further improve flood prevention preparations and launched a campaign to "inspect reservoirs, strengthen management; inspect materials, strengthen preparation."

While actively preparing for flood prevention, all localities are paying attention to water storage and conservation and strengthening the management and maintenance of water conservancy projects to meet the needs of farmland irrigation and prevent the occurrence of drought.

Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan. The Guyuan Prefecture of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is located in the high-altitude, arid mountainous area of the Liupan Mountains in the southern part of the autonomous region. The terrain is characterized by undulating hills, crisscrossing gullies, and drastic climate changes. Mountain floods and hail often occur every summer and autumn. As early as the beginning of June, the prefecture arranged for flood and hail prevention work. Recently, the entire prefecture organized a 10,000-person inspection team to conduct a comprehensive inspection of reservoirs and hail prevention preparations.

In order to completely eliminate hail before it occurs, the prefecture specifically convened a hail suppression conference to study the patterns of hail occurrence and point out hail suppression measures. Currently, the entire prefecture has organized twelve joint defense zones, nineteen joint defense lines, ten key annihilation points, and more than five hundred and eighty hail suppression points, establishing hail suppression organizations from top to bottom.
