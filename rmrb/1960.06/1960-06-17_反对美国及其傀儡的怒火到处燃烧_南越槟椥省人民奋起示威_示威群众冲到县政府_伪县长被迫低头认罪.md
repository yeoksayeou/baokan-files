Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 16th: According to newspapers here today, the people of Ben Tre Province, South Vietnam, have risen up in demonstrations against the terror and suppression policies of the US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique, demanding the release of arrested relatives. The newspapers cited recent reports from the province saying that in one county, demonstrations involving two to three thousand people occurred for several consecutive days in front of the county government. On their way from various places to the county seat, the local people along the route prepared food, water, transportation, and lodging for the demonstrators. The momentum of the demonstrators grew, frightening the puppet "County Chief" who tried to escape but was surrounded by children, women, and the elderly, who demanded punishment for the murderers, retribution for the lives of their relatives killed by the US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique, and the release of their arrested parents, husbands, and sons. One old man carried two small children on a shoulder pole to participate in the demonstration. This old man's son had recently been killed by the US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique, leaving behind two orphans.

Under the accusations of the powerful people, the "County Chief" had no choice but to publicly admit the bloody crimes of the US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique and was forced to release some of the arrested people. Afterwards, the US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique sent troops to "sweep" the area and arrested forty-two people. The masses again rose up and surrounded the "County Government," forcing the authorities to release the arrested people.

In another county, demonstrations of thousands of people also occurred in front of the local "government." The masses also wrote letters to Saigon newspapers, protesting the bloody crimes of the US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique.
