Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 25th. The Indian "Free Press" published an editorial on June 20th regarding Eisenhower's Far East trip, saying: "U.S. imperialism originally thought the atmosphere was 'favorable for it to provoke and do bad things, but the result turned out to be a harbinger of its own doom'."

The editorial said, "As Mao Zedong said, 'Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until their extinction—that is the logic of imperialism (and all reactionaries in the world). Today, this process is accelerating'."

The newspaper said: U.S. imperialism and the member states of military treaties are displaying combat power in the Pacific, thereby leading the Pacific to the "brink of war." The newspaper said that the situation in this region, like in South Korea and Japan, is such that American rule can no longer be maintained.

The newspaper said: "It is precisely at a time when imperialists believe it is a great opportunity to commit evil that the power of the forces striving for freedom, peace, and independence is displayed with unprecedented momentum. The struggles of the people in Japan, the Dominican Republic, Paraguay, Congo, Angola, South Vietnam, and other places fully demonstrate this; in the Philippines, the seeds of people's struggle have also been sown."

The newspaper criticized the Indian government's position of supporting the presence of U.S. military personnel in South Vietnam, saying that this is an "inappropriate and shameful practice."

The newspaper pointed out that in places like Japan, Turkey, and South Korea that receive "U.S. aid," "U.S. aid" has become unpopular. The newspaper said: "In short, the deceptive tricks of U.S. imperialism have reached their end. As a result, the forces opposing deception and provocation are growing stronger in one country after another."

    印度“自由报”评帝国主义的孤立处境
    美帝国主义尽作坏事末日将临
    “美援”不得人心欺骗伎俩山穷水尽
    新华社新德里25日电　印度“自由报”6月20日就艾森豪威尔远东之行发表社论说：美帝国主义在原来认为气氛“有利于它进行挑拨和作坏事，结果恰恰变成预示着自己的末日的到来”。
    社论说，“正如毛泽东所说的，捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义（和世界上一切反动派）的逻辑。今天这个过程正在加速进行”。
    报纸说：美帝国主义和军事条约的成员国在太平洋显示作战力量，从而把太平洋导向“战争边缘”。报纸说，这个地区的形势，就像南朝鲜和日本那样，美国的统治已经不能保持下去了。
    报纸说：“正是在帝国主义者认为是为非作歹的大好时机的时候，争取自由、和平和独立的力量的威力以空前浩大的声势显示出来。日本、多米尼加、巴拉圭、刚果、安哥拉、南越等地的人民的斗争，充分证明了这一点；在菲律宾，也已经播下了人民斗争的种籽”。
    报纸指责印度政府赞成美国军事人员留在南越的立场，它说，这是一种“不适宜的也是可耻的做法”。
    报纸指出，在日本、土耳其和南朝鲜等这些接受“美援”的地方，“美援”已经不得人心。报纸说：“总之，美帝国主义的欺骗伎俩，已经到了山穷水尽的日子。结果，一个接着一个国家反对欺骗和挑衅的力量增强了”。
