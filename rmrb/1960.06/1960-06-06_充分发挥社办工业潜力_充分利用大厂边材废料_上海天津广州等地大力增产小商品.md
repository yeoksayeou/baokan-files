Give Full Play to the Potential of Commune-Run Industry; Fully Utilize Scrap and Waste from Large Factories
Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou and Other Places Vigorously Increase the Production of Small Commodities

(Our Dispatch) Shanghai's industrial and commercial departments are actively organizing and arranging the production and supply of small commodities. At the beginning of the year, the city's industrial and commercial departments, based on last year's sales and this year's growth in people's needs, made early arrangements for this year's production plan. For example, in the first quarter, they arranged for summer commodities closely related to people's lives, such as bathtubs, bamboo chairs, mothballs, talcum powder, mosquito coils, and small hardware items.

This year, due to the rapid development of street factories, small commodity production has added a new force. The vast number of residents in the lane neighborhoods of the City God Temple Fumin Street area produced more than 230,000 yuan worth of processed small commodities in the first quarter alone, producing more than 100 varieties. According to statistics, 70% of the daily-use small commodities operated by the City God Temple Market's small commodity wholesale department this year are processed by lane neighborhood processing groups.

(Our Dispatch) Tianjin's industrial and commercial departments actively support the development of small commodity production by urban commune-run industries. There are more than 3,300 production units in Tianjin's commune-run industry. In supporting the development of small commodity production by commune-run industries, the industrial and commercial departments have adopted the "six helps and one guarantee" method: helping commune-run industries solve difficulties in production technology, equipment, tools, raw materials, operation and management, etc., helping to formulate production plans, improve product quality, and guaranteeing product sales. In order to help commune-run industries improve product quality, many factories have organized technical promotion teams to teach technology and train workers in commune-run factories, or to absorb commune-run industrial workers to systematically study technology in factories.

Many of the waste products purchased by the Municipal Waste Products Company after processing are supplied to commune-run industries. Commercial departments also organize commune-run factories to link up with large factories through business relations, using the side materials, scraps, and waste materials of large factories for production.

(Our Dispatch) Workers in Guangzhou's urban commune industry and street industry take materials locally and use waste materials to vigorously produce small commodities.

Guangzhou's urban commune industry and street industry operate more than 1,000 products, including small hardware products for people's daily lives, kitchen utensils, daily necessities of mountain goods, and shoes, hats, gloves, stationery, etc. Many of these products are produced from waste materials. For example, the Wen'an Street Knitting Factory refurbished and produced more than 6,000 dozen labor gloves from waste cotton yarn in the first quarter of this year. From January to April this year, the Danan Street Hardware Factory and Lingnan Street Hardware Factory used waste iron materials to produce more than 310,000 pairs of shoe lasts.

(Our Dispatch) Small commodity production in Changchun has developed rapidly, and products and output have increased sharply. In the past five months, the output of most of the city's small commodities has doubled.

Recently, the Changchun Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China organized forces to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the production of small commodities, and carried out four determinations (determining units, personnel, equipment, and output) for the current enterprises producing small commodities, and implemented specialized production. In order to ensure the production of small commodities, more than 100 major small commodities have been included in the city's production plan, and grouped management (districts and factories each manage a part of the products) is implemented, and regular inspections are organized to ensure that small commodities complete production tasks on time, in quantity, and in quality.

(Our Dispatch) The Suzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has strengthened the leadership of small commodity production and actively increased the production of small commodities.

Since the beginning of this year, while firmly grasping the production of raw materials centered on iron and steel and coal, the Suzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has strengthened its leadership over the production of small commodities. The Municipal Party Committee established a Market Office, headed by the secretary, and organized industrial, commercial, handicraft and other departments to carry out large-scale cooperation. By arranging market needs, arranging production capacity, and arranging raw material supply, they jointly formulated a small commodity production plan.

The production of summer small commodities this year was generally arranged one month to one quarter earlier than in previous years, and the variety of colors and output also exceeded any year. The Suzhou Fan Factory has produced more than one million fans. Cool hats and straw mats supplied in summer are being actively produced, and mosquito coils, talcum powder, cologne and other commodities have been launched on the market in large quantities.

    充分发挥社办工业潜力　充分利用大厂边材废料
    上海天津广州等地大力增产小商品
    本报讯　上海市工商部门积极组织和安排小商品的生产和供应。年初，市工业和商业部门就根据去年的销售和今年人民需要的增长情况，及早安排了今年的生产计划。如第一季度就安排了浴桶、竹椅、樟脑丸、爽身粉、蚊香和小五金杂件等与人民生活关系较为密切的夏令商品。
    今年由于街道工厂迅速发展，小商品生产又增加了一支新的力量。城隍庙福民街地区广大里弄居民，仅今年第一季度加工小商品的产值就达二十三万多元，生产的品种有一百多种。据统计，今年整个城隍庙市场的日用小商品批发部经营的商品，70％是经过里弄加工组加工的。
    本报讯　天津市工商部门积极扶植市区社办工业发展小商品生产。天津市社办工业的生产单位有三千三百多个。工商部门在扶植社办工业发展小商品生产中，采取“六帮一包”的办法：帮助社办工业解决生产技术、设备、工具、原料材料、经营管理等方面的困难，帮助制订生产规划，提高产品质量和包销产品。为了帮助社办工业提高产品质量，许多工厂组织了技术推广队，到社办工厂传授技术和培训工人，或吸收社办工业职工到工厂系统地学习技术。
    市废品公司收购的废品经过加工处理，有不少供应了社办工业。商业部门还通过业务关系，组织社办工厂和大工厂挂钩，利用大工厂的边料、下脚料和废料进行生产。
    本报讯　广州市城市公社工业和街道工业职工，就地取材、利用废旧料，大力生产小商品。
    广州城市公社工业和街道工业经营的产品达一千多种。人们日常生活用的小五金制品、厨房用具、山货类日用品和鞋、帽、手套、文教用具等。其中很多产品都是用废旧料生产的。如文安街针织厂今年第一季度利用废旧棉纱翻新制成的劳动手套有六千多打。大南街五金厂和岭南街五金厂等，今年1至4月利用废旧铁料制成的鞋码达三十一万多对。
    本报讯　长春市小商品生产突飞猛进，产品、产量直线上升。今年五个月来，全市小商品绝大部分产品产量都成倍增长。
    最近，中共长春市委又组织力量对小商品的生产进行了全面检查，并对当前生产小商品的企业进行四定（定单位、人员、设备、产量），实行专业生产。为确保小商品生产，又把一百多种主要小商品纳入市的生产计划，实行分组管理（区、厂各管理一部分产品），定期组织检查，保证小商品按期、按量、按质的完成生产任务。
    本报讯　中共苏州市委加强小商品生产的领导，积极增产小商品。
    今年以来，中共苏州市委在狠抓以钢铁煤为中心的原材料生产的同时，加强了对小商品生产的领导。市委建立了市场办公室，由书记挂帅，组织工业、商业、手工业等部门开展大协作，通过排市场需要、排生产能力、排原材料供应，共同制订了小商品生产计划。
    今年夏令小商品安排生产，一般比往年提早了一个月至一个季度，花色品种和产量也超过了任何一年。苏州团扇厂已生产了一百多万把团扇。夏天供应的凉帽、草席正在积极生产，蚊香、爽身粉、花露水等商品已经大量上市。
