Xinhua News Agency, Yangon, 7th June: According to reports in Yangon newspapers today, the Burmese Workers' Party and the People's Comrade Party passed a resolution at a joint meeting held here on the 5th, exposing the conspiracy behind Eisenhower's visit to the Far East.

The resolution stated that after Eisenhower sabotaged the four-power summit, he decided to visit Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and other places in order to further strengthen American military control over these areas, so as to intensify aggression and military provocations.

The resolution emphasized that Eisenhower's "visit" was not for friendship, but for aggression. The resolution said that the Japanese people are currently strengthening their struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and against Eisenhower's visit to Japan.

The resolution also expressed disagreement with Burmese Prime Minister U Nu's preparation to invite Eisenhower to visit Burma.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 7th June: The Indonesian "Dawn Daily" published an editorial today supporting the Japanese people's struggle against Eisenhower's visit to Japan to carry out conspiratorial activities.

The editorial pointed out that Eisenhower's "visit" to Japan is not an ordinary "visit," but a visit aimed at strengthening a war bloc. However, the Japanese people do not want to be involved in war again, and they demand that U.S. troops withdraw from Japan because they have suffered greatly in past wars.

The editorial said that the Japanese people will not allow Eisenhower to visit their country, and even if he manages to get to Japan through force and coercion, his visit cannot be considered legitimate.

Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, 3rd June: Pakistan's "Today" newspaper published an editorial on the Japanese political situation, saying that "no government can remain in power for long by offending the people and acting against their will."

The newspaper pointed out that under the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force will have the right to establish their bases in Japan and have the right to use Japanese territory for war purposes. The Japanese people "believe that this treaty is dangerous to them. They do not want to be dragged into future wars."

"Dawn" newspaper said in a Tokyo dispatch today that the high-handed approach of Kishin Suke's Liberal Democratic Party in forcibly "passing" the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in the House of Representatives has created the most serious political crisis Japan has ever had.

The newspaper pointed out that Kishi Nobusuke "was once a war criminal," and now he "is attempting to present a so-called security treaty as a gift to U.S. President Eisenhower." The newspaper said that only with the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, the dissolution of the House of Representatives, and the complete abolition of the "Security Treaty" can Japan "return to normal."

    缅甸工人党和人民同志党揭露
    艾森豪威尔访问远东不怀好意
    印度尼西亚“黎明日报”支持日本人民反对艾森豪威尔访日
    新华社仰光7日电　据仰光报纸今天报道，缅甸工人党和人民同志党5日在这里举行的联席会议上通过一项决议，揭露艾森豪威尔访问远东的阴谋。
    决议说，艾森豪威尔破坏了四国首脑会议以后，决定访问日本、南朝鲜、台湾等地，是为了进一步加强美国对这些地方的军事控制，以便加紧进行侵略和军事挑衅。
    决议强调说，艾森豪威尔的“访问”不是为了友谊，而是为了侵略。决议说，日本人民目前正在加强斗争，反对日美军事同盟条约和反对艾森豪威尔访问日本。
    决议还表示不同意缅甸总理吴努准备邀请艾森豪威尔访问缅甸。
    新华社雅加达7日电　印度尼西亚“黎明日报”今天发表社论，支持日本人民反对艾森豪威尔到日本进行阴谋活动的斗争。
    社论指出，艾森豪威尔“访问”日本不是平常的“访问”，而是一次旨在加强战争集团的访问。但是日本人民不愿再次卷入战争，他们要求美军撤出日本，因为他们在过去的战争中已经吃过很大的苦头。
    社论说，日本人民不许艾森豪威尔访问他们的国家，即便他通过武力和强迫手段设法到了日本，他的访问也不能被认为是正当的。
    新华社卡拉奇3日电　巴基斯坦“今天报”就日本政局发表社论说，“没有一个政府通过触怒人民和违背人民的意愿的作法而能够长久当政”。
    这家报纸指出，根据新日美“安全条约”，美国的陆、海、空军将有权利在日本建立他们的基地，并有权利为了战争目的而使用日本的领土。日本人民“认为这个条约对他们是危险的。他们不愿意被卷入未来的战争中去”。
    “黎明报”今天在一篇东京通讯中说，日本岸信介的自由民主党在众议院强行“通过”新日美“安全条约”的蛮横作法，已经造成了日本从未有过的一次最严重的政治危机。
    这家报纸指出，岸信介“曾经是一个战犯”，现在他“企图把一个所谓安全条约的礼物赠送给美国总统艾森豪威尔”。这家报纸说，只有岸信介内阁辞职，解散众议院，完全废除“安全条约”，日本“才能恢复正常”。
