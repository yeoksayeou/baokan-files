Witness to the Paper Tiger
—Thoughts on Visiting the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea Hall of the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution
Li Mingtian, Wang Jiqi

Amidst the upsurge of the entire nation opposing U.S. imperialist aggression and bombarding the "plague god," the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea Hall of the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution has opened. On the very day of its opening, we visited this hall, saw the various exhibits from the Battle of Triangle Hill (Shangganling), and learned about the deeds and relics of our heroic comrades-in-arms who rendered outstanding service to the Chinese and Korean people, which brought back many memories.

In front of the large sand table of the Battle of Triangle Hill, we stood for a good several minutes, looking at the two small hilltops in front of Mount Wu Sheng (Five Holy Mountains), which reminded us of those days of fighting on the front lines of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea eight years ago. In order to attack these two small hilltops, the enemy used more than 50,000 troops and hundreds of planes and cannons. In order to invade these two small hilltops, the enemy launched dozens of rounds of attacks every day, for a full forty-six days. But in front of these two heroic small hilltops, the enemy suffered an unprecedentedly disastrous defeat, with more than 20,000 American and Rhee Syngman bandit troops killed or wounded. These ironclad facts fully prove that U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger. We remember that the soldiers at the time composed a clapper talk, which said it very well:

　　The Volunteer Army's might shakes the four seas,
　　American devils tremble in fear.
　　Triangle Hill stands firm and unmoved,
　　The paper tiger is no good, no good!

In the Battle of Triangle Hill, countless heroes emerged. The loess stained red with the blood of martyr Huang Jiguang, the machine gun used by Sun Zhanyuan, and Niu Baocai's wire hook are all displayed in glass cabinets. These immortal relics of the martyrs will forever remain in our memories, and we are proud to have such heroic comrades-in-arms. It was also during the Battle of Triangle Hill that when we saw or heard of their heroic sacrifices, we shed tears of pride. Huang Jiguang, for the sake of victory, used his own body to block the enemy's gun muzzle, ensuring that our counterattacking forces annihilated more than 400 enemies in one fell swoop; Sun Zhanyuan, with both legs broken, used this machine gun to cover his soldier Yi Caixue as he blew up four enemy fire points; Niu Baocai connected the wires more than 500 times during the major counterattack, ensuring smooth communication for command, and the soldiers said, "Niu Baocai's wires cannot be blown up." Even after being seriously wounded, he used his body to conduct electricity, ensuring that the commander issued the attack order in a timely manner. Every one of our soldiers was so brave and tenacious, not hesitating to sacrifice themselves. How could the enemy not be afraid in the face of such heroic soldiers? How could the enemy not suffer a disastrous defeat in the face of such heroic soldiers? It is not difficult to understand why the enemy always had to use machine guns behind them during their charges to supervise the battle, forcing soldiers to sell their lives for the Wall Street bosses; why American soldiers cried like ghosts and wailed, prayed to God for protection, and fled with their heads in their hands as soon as they heard our gunshots. The enemy is a paper tiger, a good-for-nothing, in front of our soldiers!

Eight years have passed, and "we are getting better day by day, while the enemy is rotting day by day." Amidst the upsurge of people around the world opposing aggression, what lies before imperialism "is no longer just one Triangle Hill, but thousands upon thousands of Triangle Hills." Dulles comes out, Dulles gets beaten; Nixon comes out, Nixon gets beaten; Eisenhower comes out, then Eisenhower gets beaten. One cannot be polite to man-eating "tigers"; one must hit them hard and bomb them hard. But the enemy is not reconciled to defeat; "the dog's nature will never change." Therefore, we must heighten our vigilance a hundredfold, expose Eisenhower's conspiracy of false peace and real war preparations, expose his conspiracy to create "two Chinas" and continue to occupy our territory of Taiwan, carry forward the Triangle Hill fighting spirit, inherit the legacy of the martyrs, and vow not to rest until Taiwan is liberated! Vow not to rest until U.S. imperialism is overthrown!

    纸老虎的见证
    ——参观革命军事博物馆抗美援朝战争馆有感
    李明天　王吉其
    在全国人民反对美帝侵略，炮轰“瘟神”的怒潮中，中国人民革命军事博物馆抗美援朝馆开放了。就在开放的一天，我们参观了这个馆，看到了上甘岭战役的种种陈列和为中朝人民立下了汗马功劳的我们的英雄战友的事迹和遗物，使我们想起了许多往事。
    在上甘岭战役的大沙盘面前，我们足足呆了好几十分钟，看着五圣山面前的那两个小山头，使我们想起了八年前我们在抗美援朝前线的那些战斗的日子。敌人为了进攻这两个小山头，使用了五万多兵力和数以百计的飞机大炮。敌人为了进犯这两个小山头，每天进行数十次的轮番攻击，整整打了四十六天。但是在这两个英雄的小山头面前，敌人遭到了前所未有的惨败，死伤两万多美李匪军。我们这两个小山头仍然傲然地屹立未动。在这些铁一般的事实面前，完全证明美帝国主义是一只纸老虎。记得当时战士们编了一首快板，说得很对：
    志愿军威震四海，
    美国鬼胆战心惊。
    上甘岭屹立未动，
    纸老虎不中不中！
    在上甘岭战役中，出现了无数英雄。当年黄继光烈士鲜血染红的黄土，孙占元使用的机枪，牛保才的电线拐，都陈设在玻璃柜里。烈士们这些不朽的遗物，永远留在我们的记忆里，我们为有这样英雄的战友而感到自豪。还是在上甘岭战役中，当我们看到或听到他们英勇牺牲的时候，便激动地流出了骄傲的眼泪。黄继光为了胜利，用自己的肉体，堵住了敌人的枪眼，保证我们反击部队一举歼灭敌人四百多；孙占元在两腿被打断的情况下，就是用这挺机枪，掩护他的战士易才学爆破敌人四个火力点；牛保才在大反击时，接线头五百多次，保证了指挥畅通，战士们说：“牛保才的电线是炸不断的”，他在身负重伤之后，仍用肉体导电，保证指挥员及时下达了攻击命令。我们的每个战士都是这样英勇顽强、不惜牺牲。敌人在我们这样的英雄战士面前，怎么不害怕呢？敌人在我们这样英雄的战士面前，怎么能不惨败呢？这就不难理解：敌人在冲锋时，为什么总要用机枪在后面督战，逼迫士兵为华尔街老板卖命；美国士兵一听到了我们的枪声，为什么要神哭鬼嚎、祈祷上帝保佑、向后抱头鼠窜。敌人在我们战士面前，是纸老虎，是草包！
    八年过去了，“我们一天天好起来，敌人一天天烂下去”。在世界人民反对侵略的怒潮中，摆在帝国主义面前的“已经不是一个上甘岭，而是千千万万个上甘岭。杜勒斯出来，杜勒斯挨揍；尼克松出来，尼克松挨揍；艾森豪威尔出来，便是艾森豪威尔挨揍；对吃人的“老虎”是不能讲什么客气的，就要狠狠地打，狠狠地轰。但是敌人是不甘心失败的，“狗性总是不会改变的”。因而，我们必须百倍提高警惕，揭露艾森豪威尔假和平真备战的阴谋，揭露他制造“两个中国”、继续侵占我国领土台湾的阴谋，发扬上甘岭战斗精神，继承先烈们的遗志，不解放台湾，誓不休！不打倒美帝国主义，誓不休！
