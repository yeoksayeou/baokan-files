Xinhua News Agency, June 3rd, Tokyo Dispatch: According to a report in today's "Asahi Shimbun," 20,000 shops across Japan will strike on June 4th to participate in the general strike against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

The newspaper said that these small and medium-sized enterprises, belonging to the "National Federation of Commercial and Industrial Organizations," are mainly distributed in Tokyo, Osaka, Hyogo, Kyoto, Kumamoto, Niigata, Gunma, and Miyagi, among other places.

According to reports, 8,000 shops in Tokyo are preparing to strike on the 4th, with 2,000 of them deciding to strike all day. The striking shops will post the following notice in front of their doors: "Dear Customers, let us rise up together to oppose the Security Treaty, demand the resignation of the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, and dissolve the Diet!" On that day, capitalists and workers from the striking shops will collect signatures on nearby streets and participate in petition activities to the Diet in the afternoon. The "Small and Medium Enterprises Roundtable on Security Treaty Issues," composed of some manufacturers, issued a statement yesterday expressing its firm support for the June 4th general strike and striking on that day.

Two thousand shops in Kobe and Amagasaki have also decided to participate in the 17th National Unified Action.

Five hundred shop employees from these stores also plan to hold a motorcycle demonstration on that day.

The news said that small and medium-sized traders in the Kansai region have also issued calls for the dissolution of the Diet. The Kansai branch of the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade decided yesterday to submit a written opinion to the Liberal Democratic Party demanding the dissolution of the Diet.

In Tokyo, 1,000 business owners will hold demonstrations in front of the Diet and Nobusuke Kishi's official residence.
