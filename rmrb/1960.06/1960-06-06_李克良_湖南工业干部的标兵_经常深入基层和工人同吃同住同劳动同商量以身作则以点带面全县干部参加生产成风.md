(Our newspaper's Changsha dispatch, 5th) The broad masses of cadres on Hunan Province's industrial front are launching the activity of "learning from Li Keliang, catching up with Li Keliang." Comrade Li Keliang is the Secretary of the CCP Changning County Committee and began leading industrial production in the second half of 1958. His work style is in-depth, he is good at following the mass line, he can eat, live, and labor with the workers, and he dares to think and act, possessing a spirit of continuous revolution. Under his specific leadership, the Songbai Iron Plant in Changning County has become a red flag on the industrial front in Hunan Province; he has explored and created many experiences in leadership work from this factory, promoting the continuous leap forward of industrial production throughout the county.

    Establishing a Camp at the Grassroots

In the second half of 1958, the CCP Changning County Committee assigned Comrade Li Keliang to lead industry. At that time, the entire county only had an agricultural implement repair and manufacturing plant, a small coal mine, and a small number of service-processing small factories, with fewer than three hundred production workers. Comrade Li Keliang had long been leading agriculture, lacked industrial production knowledge, and also lacked experience in leading industrial production. Only because there were not many factories had he not encountered too many difficulties. However, during the Great Leap Forward, the county established eighteen new county-level factories in mining, smelting, agricultural machinery, pesticides, etc., in just over two months, and the communes also established one hundred and sixty-five factories, with the number of production workers rapidly increasing to more than fourteen thousand. The newly established factories urgently needed to strengthen leadership.

From where should one start to strengthen leadership? What kind of leadership methods should be used to adapt to the requirements of the new situation? Comrade Li Keliang seriously studied the Party's relevant documents and decided to go deep down to "dissect a sparrow," break through at one point, gain experience, and then use this experience to guide the overall situation. After research by the County Committee, it was decided to go deep into the Songbai Iron Plant.

    Participating in Production, Leading Production

Comrade Li Keliang, carrying his luggage and leading several cadres from the County Committee's Industry and Transportation Office, came to the Songbai Iron Plant. He first learned in detail about all aspects of the situation. At that time, this newly established factory had relatively poor equipment and technical conditions. Two small furnaces could not produce more than two or three tons of iron per day, and good iron was no more than 30%; the working and living conditions were not very good, and the workers' thinking was not stable enough.

After basically understanding the situation, he believed that the key issue at the moment was to put politics in command, strengthen ideological education, and make all cadres and workers deeply realize the importance of the iron plant to arming county and commune industries and promoting the technological transformation of agriculture, as well as its long-term prospects, and to fully mobilize everyone's enthusiasm to do a good job in production. He did a lot of work in this regard. In order to effectively grasp production, he decided to go deep into the workers, eat, live, labor, and consult with the workers, and use the method of participating in production to become familiar with production and lead production. In addition to some office and meeting time each day, he spent several hours working with the workers; at night, he slept with the workers, and during the day, he ate with them.

When he was working at the No. 4 Communist Youth League Furnace, he carefully observed, thought, and humbly asked the workers for advice, and signed a master-apprentice contract with Zhao Fuming, a furnace operator (now the deputy director); after work, he would find cadres and workers to study and learn about the advanced experience introduced in the "Metallurgical News" or other newspapers regarding producing more iron and producing good iron. After improving the technology, the utilization coefficient of this small blast furnace increased by more than double, and the qualified rate of pig iron increased from 30% to 80%. The workers enthusiastically praised Comrade Li Keliang for leading well. Someone even composed a ditty: Secretary Li comes to the factory, production blossoms red, quality has changed, and output leaps forward.

While Comrade Li Keliang grasped production, he also paid attention to grasping life. He firmly remembered the Party's teachings: the greater the enthusiasm of the masses, the more we must care about the lives of the masses; the more the Party cares about the lives of the masses, the greater the enthusiasm of the masses. Caring about life is actually caring about production. Once, when the weather was not yet very hot, he saw several workers preparing to take a cold shower. He dissuaded them and immediately found the chairman of the trade union, and he himself helped to dig gas ducts, using pipes to connect the gas from the iron-smelting furnace to the bathhouse to burn water, so that the workers could conveniently take hot showers. When some workers were sick, Comrade Li Keliang always took the time to visit them... The workers were all moved and said: "The leading comrades care about us so much, we have strength no matter how tired we are."

    Striving for the Upper Reaches, Continuous Revolution

Comrade Li Keliang paid attention to studying the ideological situation of the workers at any time during his work. He helped the factory's leadership to struggle against various wrong ideas. In the third quarter of last year, he led the Party organization of the Songbai Iron Plant to launch a resolute struggle against the right-leaning conservative thinking of a small number of cadres. All the workers in the factory greatly boosted their enthusiasm, and a small blast furnace of 22.5 cubic meters was completed in only forty-five days, shortening the originally planned construction period by half. Production throughout the factory took another leap forward.

In January of this year, some cadres saw that production had greatly developed compared to the past and developed the idea that "production has reached the top." Comrade Li Keliang led all the workers in carrying out "three investigations and three comparisons": investigating ideology and comparing enthusiasm; investigating methods and comparing technological innovation; investigating measures and comparing the movement for high quality and high yield. At the same time, he went to the No. 4 furnace to work and vigorously carried out technological transformation, enabling the No. 4 furnace to create outstanding results and promoting the furnace utilization coefficient of the entire factory to climb to a new peak.

    Using a Single Point to Drive the Overall Production of the County

After Comrade Li Keliang went deep into the Songbai Iron Plant, the industrial production of this factory and the entire county continuously showed new leap forward situations.

Not long after he arrived at the Songbai Iron Plant, he chose the newly built No. 4 furnace, with its poor equipment conditions and long distance for transporting materials, as his experimental furnace. From furnace design and technical transformation to achieving high quality and high yield, he personally participated in almost every measure in order to find a complete set of experience. Whenever the No. 4 furnace created advanced experience, he immediately organized the entire factory to promote it. Since the beginning of this year, he has conducted seven high-yield tests in the No. 4 furnace, promoting it once for each test, and the entire factory has organized a total of seven high-yield campaigns. Influenced by Comrade Li Keliang, the cadres of the Songbai Iron Plant were also able to go deep into the masses and deep into production, and promptly discover and solve problems in production, thus enabling the furnace utilization coefficient of the entire factory to improve and constantly maintain an advanced level.

The experience of the Songbai Iron Plant was quickly disseminated and guided the industrial production of the entire county. The Dayishan Iron Plant learned and promoted the experience of the Songbai Iron Plant, and its utilization coefficient also rapidly increased. The working methods and work style of the Songbai Iron Plant's cadres in following shifts, "four togethers" (eating together, living together, laboring together, and consulting together), and "three guarantees" (guaranteeing ideology, guaranteeing production, and guaranteeing life) in leading production were quickly and universally promoted in all industrial and mining enterprises throughout the county. Now, cadres participating in production and leading production have become a common practice in industrial and mining enterprises throughout Changning County.

In order to do a good job in using a single point to drive the overall situation, Comrade Li Keliang, in addition to convening necessary on-site meetings, usually used other methods to grasp the overall situation. The telephone briefing to guide the county's industrial production was held in the Songbai Iron Plant. The County Committee's Industrial Transportation Office had already followed Secretary Li to the Songbai Iron Plant to work. He usually also took 20% of his time to go to other factories and mines to inspect production and solve problems. In this way, he promoted the continuous and sustained rise of industrial production throughout the county.

    李克良—湖南工业干部的标兵
    经常深入基层和工人同吃同住同劳动同商量以身作则以点带面全县干部参加生产成风
    本报长沙5日电　湖南省工业战线上的广大干部，正在开展“学李克良，赶李克良”的活动。李克良同志是中共湖南省常宁县委书记，1958年下半年开始领导工业生产。他的工作作风深入，善于走群众路线，能够和工人同吃、同住、同劳动，并且敢想敢干，具有不断革命的思想。常宁县松柏铁厂在他的具体领导下，已成为湖南省工业战线上的一面红旗；他从这个厂摸索、创造了许多领导工作方面的经验，推动了全县工业生产不断跃进。
    到基层扎营
    1958年下半年，中共常宁县委分配李克良同志领导工业。当时，全县只有一个农具修制厂、一个小型煤矿和少数服务加工性的小型工厂，生产工人不到三百人。李克良同志长期领导农业，缺乏工业生产知识，也缺乏领导工业生产的经验。只是因为工厂不多，还没有碰到太大的困难。但是，在大跃进中，全县在两个多月中就新办起了十八个采掘、冶炼、农业机械、农药等县属工厂，公社也办了一百六十五个工厂，生产工人迅速增加到一万四千多人。新办起的工厂迫切需要加强领导。
    从何处着手来加强领导？用什么样的领导方法，来适应新形势的要求呢？李克良同志认真学习了党的有关文件，决定深入下去“解剖麻雀”，突破一点，取得经验，然后利用这种经验去指导全面。经过县委会研究，决定深入到松柏铁厂去。参加生产　领导生产
    李克良同志带着行李，率领着县委工业交通办公室的几个干部，来到松柏铁厂。他首先详细了解了各方面的情况。当时，这个刚办起来的厂子，设备、技术条件都比较差，两个小炉子一天炼不出二、三吨铁，好铁不过30％；工作、生活条件都不太好，工人思想也不够稳定。
    情况基本上摸清楚以后，他认为当前的关键问题，是要政治挂帅，加强思想教育，要使全体干部和工人都深刻认识到铁厂对武装县社工业和促进农业技术改造的重要性，以及它的远大前途，要充分调动大家的积极性来搞好生产。在这方面，他作了许多工作。为了切实把生产抓好，他决定深入到工人中去，和工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，用参加生产的办法，来熟悉生产，领导生产。每天除了一些办公、开会的时间以外，他都有几个小时和工人一道劳动；晚上和工人睡在一起，白天吃饭在一起。
    他在四号共青炉劳动的时候，细心地观察、思考，虚心向工人请教，并同炉前工赵福明（现为副厂长）订了师徒合同；下班后，就找干部和工人们研究，学习“冶金报”或其他报纸上介绍的有关多出铁、出好铁的先进经验。经过改进技术，这座小高炉的利用系数提高了一倍多，生铁合格率由30％提高到80％。工人们热烈赞扬李克良同志领导得好。有人还作了一首快板唱道：李书记来到厂，生产开红花，质量变了样，产量跨骏马。
    李克良同志在生产劳动中，逐步学会了许多生产知识。现在，他一看火，就能够知道炉温够不够，该不该出铁；听风声，就知道鼓风机漏不漏风，风量足不足；看颜色，就能测定铁的质量好不好。
    李克良同志在抓生产的同时，也很注意抓生活。他牢牢地记着党的教导：群众干劲越大，我们越要关心群众生活；党越关心群众生活，群众的干劲也愈大。关心生活，实际上也是关心生产。有一次天气还不太热，他看到几个工人准备用冷水洗澡，他劝阻了他们，并且立即找来工会主席，自己也动手，帮助挖煤气道，用管子把炼铁炉的煤气接到澡堂去烧水，使工人们可以方便地洗到热水澡。有的工人病了，李克良同志总要抽空去看望……工人们都感动地说：领导同志这样关心我们，再累也有劲。”
    力争上游　不断革命
    李克良同志在工作中注意随时研究职工的思想情况。帮助工厂领导人员对各种错误思想作斗争。去年第三季度，他领导松柏铁厂的党组织对少数干部的右倾保守思想开展了坚决的斗争。全厂职工大鼓干劲，一座二十二点五立方米的小高炉，只用四十五天就建成了，比原来规定的工期缩短了一半。全厂生产又跃进一步。
    今年1月间，部分干部看到生产比过去有了很大发展，产生了“生产到顶”思想。李克良同志领导全厂职工开展了“三查三比”：查思想，比干劲；查办法，比技术革新；查措施，比优质高产运动。同时，自己下到四号炉跟班劳动，大搞技术改造，使四号炉创造了优异的成绩，推动全厂高炉利用系数攀上了新的高峰。
    以点带面推动全县生产
    李克良同志深入松柏铁厂以后，这个厂和全县的工业生产就不断出现新的跃进局面。
    他到松柏铁厂不久，就选择了新建的设备条件差、运料较远的四号炉作为自己的试验炉。从炉子设计、技术改造到实现优质高产，差不多每一项措施，他都亲自参加，以便摸出一套完整的经验。每当四号炉创造先进经验以后，他便立即组织全厂推广。今年以来，他在四号炉进行了七次高产试验，试验一次就推广一次，全厂共组织了七次高产战役。松柏铁厂的干部在李克良同志影响下，也都能深入群众，深入生产，及时发现和解决生产中的问题，因而使全厂高炉利用系数提高，经常保持先进水平。
    松柏铁厂的经验，又很快传播开去，指导了全县的工业生产。大义山铁厂学习和推广了松柏铁厂的经验，利用系数也迅速提高。松柏铁厂干部的跟班劳动、四同（同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量）、三包（包思想，包生产，包生活）等领导生产的工作方法和工作作风，很快在全县各工矿企业中普遍推广。现在，干部参加生产，领导生产，在常宁全县工矿企业中已经成为普遍风尚。
    李克良同志为了作好以点带面，除召开必要的现场会以外，平时还利用其他方法来掌握全面情况。指导全县工业生产的电话汇报，就是在松柏铁厂里召开的。县委的工业交通办公室，早就跟着李书记到松柏铁厂办公了。他平时还抽出20％的时间到其他厂矿去检查生产，解决问题。这样，便推动了全县工业生产持续不断地走向高涨。
