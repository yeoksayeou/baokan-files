New Development of Workers' Amateur Cultural Activities

The National Workers' Amateur Art Performance in the capital has concluded victoriously. This is the largest comprehensive national workers' amateur art performance since the founding of the People's Republic. Participating were 2,700 workers from 28 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country. They represent over three million workers in the national industrial and mining enterprises' amateur art troupes. They brought over 500 dazzling music, dance, folk art, and drama programs. These programs enthusiastically praised the Party and Chairman Mao, and the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes; vividly reflected the ever-changing changes in our great motherland, the rich reality of struggle, and the heroic deeds of the working class. This fully demonstrates that under the leadership and care of the Party, the workers' amateur cultural activities have adhered to and implemented Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art, and have become a powerful tool for educating and inspiring the people, publicizing policies, promoting production and construction, increasing workers' cultural knowledge, and enlivening workers' cultural life.

This performance was held under excellent domestic and international circumstances. The new development situation has emerged because the workers' amateur cultural activities have closely followed the development of the situation. The upsurge of socialist revolution and socialist construction in our country has promoted the upsurge of cultural revolution and the great development of cultural and artistic undertakings. In the practice of revolution and construction, the masses of workers have increasingly demanded culture and art; they not only demand to appreciate literature and art, but also demand to participate in literary and artistic activities and creation to encourage themselves and educate the masses. Therefore, workers' amateur cultural activities have flourished unprecedentedly with the leap forward in industrial and agricultural construction, the elimination of illiteracy, and the development of universal education.

In the technical revolution, the cultural revolution, and the movement to establish urban people's communes in a big way, the workers have fully carried forward the spirit of continuous revolution and communist collaboration, creating many miracles. At the same time, they are moved by this noble spirit and the miracles they have created. They have not only written a large number of folk songs, but also created many songs, folk art, dramas, dances, etc. Many excellent programs in this performance demonstrated the heroic spirit of the working class holding high the three red banners and advancing victoriously; demonstrated the firm belief of the people in always following the Party and Chairman Mao; and demonstrated the completely new era and completely new characters. They have used national and folk art forms, and innovated and developed them to make them suitable for expressing our great era and the spirit of the working class. This kind of creation and innovation is often achieved through the collective efforts of the masses. They dare to criticize and dare to create. Therefore, in some works and performances, they have not only inherited the excellent traditions of our great national art, but also endowed new spirits based on the new content of life, creating works with both rich ideological content and beautiful artistic forms, adding wealth to the new socialist culture.

The victory of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological front has also brought about a significant change in the quality of workers' amateur cultural teams. In many places, workers' amateur cultural teams have put forward the five-good requirements of good ideology, good production, good learning, good connection with the masses, and good cultural activities, and regularly carry out criticism and self-criticism, gradually achieving not only educating the masses with cultural activities, but also educating themselves and improving their thinking in cultural activities. Because the Party attaches importance to workers' amateur cultural activities, and regards workers' amateur cultural activities as a weapon for promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology, many advanced producers not only lead the masses forward in production, but also participate in amateur cultural activities, leading the masses forward politically and ideologically. Among the more than 2,000 amateur art activists who participated in this performance, more than 30% are advanced producers and advanced workers. At the same time, many responsible comrades of the Party, government, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League in industrial and mining enterprises also regard participating in amateur cultural activities as one of the methods of contacting the masses. This ensures the correct implementation of the Party's literary and art policy. Many workers' amateur cultural activists have full political enthusiasm in production, learning, and cultural activities. They are pioneers of innovation in production, excellent students in learning, and active members of amateur cultural activities.

The achievements of workers' amateur cultural activities are the victory of implementing the Party's policy of walking on two legs in cultural and artistic work. Socialist culture and art belong to the working people and serve the working people. It is impossible to develop and prosper socialist culture and art without fully mobilizing the broad masses to participate in the creation of culture and art. The correct policy is: to vigorously carry out popularization work, while at the same time paying close attention to improving quality; to greatly develop amateur cultural activities, while at the same time grasping the training and improvement of professional teams, and closely integrating professional and amateur teams. Both professional cultural and art teams and amateur cultural and art teams need to develop, and should learn from and promote each other. Professional literary and art teams need to select talents from amateur literary and art activists, cultivate and improve them. Amateur literary and art teams must also rely on the guidance of professional literary and art teams. Both of these teams need to develop greatly. Because the fundamental purpose of the cultural revolution is to make workers and peasants intellectualized and intellectuals laborized, this is an extremely profound revolution. In this revolution, the phenomenon of workers and peasants lacking culture will be further eliminated, and the bourgeois ideology of intellectuals will be further eliminated; more new intellectuals will be cultivated, and old intellectuals will be thoroughly transformed. Professional literary and art teams and workers' amateur literary and art teams should be more closely integrated. Only in this way can we establish a strong working-class cultural and art team and make socialist culture and art increasingly prosperous.

The National Workers' Art Performance was held on the basis of the great popularization, great improvement, and great prosperity of workers' amateur art activities. It summarized and exchanged the experiences of workers' amateur art activities since the Great Leap Forward, strengthened the relationship between professional art troupes and workers' amateur art teams, and enabled workers' amateur art activities to be further improved on the basis of popularization, and continued to be popularized under the guidance of improvement. In the future, under the principle of serving workers, peasants and soldiers and serving socialist construction, workers' amateur art activities must firmly implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new," adhere to the principles of amateurism and voluntarism, and push workers' amateur art activities to a new stage of greater popularization and greater improvement. Workers' amateur art workers should strengthen political study, strengthen the study of Comrade Mao Zedong's works, strengthen the study of culture and art theory, and constantly improve their political and ideological level, cultural level, and artistic level. Workers' amateur art teams are the working class's own art teams, and should strive to follow Mao Zedong's literary and art direction and make more and greater contributions to socialist and communist literature and art!

### 职工业余文艺活动的新发展

     职工业余文艺活动的新发展
    在首都举行的全国职工文艺会演已经胜利闭幕了。这是建国以来，规模最大的一次全国职工业余文艺综合性会演。参加的有全国二十八个省、市、自治区的二千七百多名职工。他们代表着全国工矿企业的三百多万职工业余文艺队伍。他们带来了五百多个绚丽多采的音乐、舞蹈、曲艺、戏剧等节目。这些节目热情地歌颂了党和毛主席，歌颂了总路线、大跃进和人民公社；生动地反映了我们伟大祖国日新月异的变化，反映了丰富的现实斗争生活和工人阶级的英雄事迹。这就充分地说明了，职工业余文艺活动在党的领导和关怀下，坚持贯彻了毛泽东文艺思想，成为教育和鼓舞人民，宣传政策，推动生产建设，增进职工文化知识，活跃职工文化生活的有力工具。
    这次会演是在国内外大好形势下举行的。由于职工业余文艺活动，紧紧跟上了形势的发展，才出现了新的发展局面。我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的高潮，促进了文化革命的高潮，促进了文化艺术事业的大发展。职工群众在革命和建设的实践中，对文化艺术的要求日益增长，他们不仅要求欣赏文艺，也要求自己参与文艺活动和文艺创作，以鼓舞自己和教育群众。因此，职工业余文艺活动就随着工农业建设的跃进、扫盲和普及教育的发展而有了空前的繁荣。
    在技术革命、文化革命和大办城市人民公社运动中，职工充分发扬了不断革命和共产主义协作精神，创造了许多奇迹。同时，他们自己又为这种崇高的精神和自己所创造的奇迹所感动，不仅写出了大量的民歌，还创作了许多歌曲、曲艺、戏剧、舞蹈等。这次会演中的许多优秀节目表现了工人阶级高举三面红旗乘胜前进的英雄气概；表现了人民群众永远跟着党走，跟着毛主席走的坚强信念；表现了全新的时代和全新的人物。他们运用了民族民间的艺术形式，并且加以革新和发展，使它适宜于表现我们伟大的时代，适宜于表现工人阶级的气概。这种创造和革新，往往是经过群众的集体努力来实现的。他们敢于批判、敢于创造，所以，在一些作品和表演中，不仅继承了我国伟大的民族艺术的优秀传统，而且，根据新的生活内容，赋予了新的精神，创造出既有丰富的思想内容，又有优美的艺术形式的作品，为社会主义新文化增添了财富。
    政治思想战线上的社会主义革命的胜利，也使职工业余文艺队伍在质量上起了显著的变化。不少地方的职工业余文艺队伍提出了思想好、生产好、学习好、联系群众好、文艺活动好的五好要求，经常开展批评和自我批评，逐步做到了不仅用文艺活动教育群众，而且在文艺活动中教育自己，提高自己的思想。由于党对职工业余文艺活动的重视，把职工业余文艺活动作为兴无产阶级思想、灭资产阶级思想的武器，所以不少先进生产者不仅在生产上带动群众前进，还参加到业余文艺活动中来，从政治思想上带动群众前进。参加这次会演的二千多名业余文艺积极分子当中，就有30％以上是先进生产者和先进工作者。同时，不少工矿的党、政、工、团负责同志，也把参加业余文艺活动作为联系群众的方法之一，这样就保证了党的文艺方针的正确贯彻。许多职工业余文艺活动分子在生产上、学习上、文艺活动上都有饱满的政治热情。他们在生产上是革新的闯将，在学习上是优秀的学生，同时又是业余文艺活动上的积极分子。
    职工业余文艺活动所获得的这些成就，是执行了党在文化艺术工作上两条腿走路的方针的胜利。社会主义的文化艺术，是属于劳动人民和为劳动人民服务的，不充分发动广大群众参与文化艺术的创造，要发展和繁荣社会主义文化艺术是不可能的。正确的方针是：大力开展普及工作，同时又切实注意提高质量；大量发展业余文化活动，同时又抓紧培养和提高专业队伍，并使专业和业余的队伍密切结合。专业的文化艺术队伍和业余的文化艺术队伍都需要发展，应该相互学习和相互促进。专业文艺队伍需要从业余文艺活动分子中选拔人才，加以培养和提高。业余文艺队伍也一定要依靠专业文艺队伍的辅导。这两支队伍都要有极大的发展。因为文化革命的根本目的，是使工农群众知识化，知识分子劳动化，这是一个极其深刻的革命，在这个革命里面，会进一步消灭工农群众缺乏文化的现象，也会进一步肃清知识分子的资产阶级思想；会培养出更多新的知识分子，也使旧的知识分子得到彻底的改造。专业文艺队伍和职工业余文艺队伍，应该更加密切地结合，只有这样，才能建立起一支强大的工人阶级的文化艺术队伍，使社会主义文化艺术日益繁荣昌盛。
    全国职工文艺会演就是在职工业余文艺活动大普及、大提高、大繁荣的基础上举行的，它总结和交流了大跃进以来职工业余文艺活动的经验，密切了专业文艺团体和职工业余文艺队伍的关系，使职工业余文艺活动在普及的基础上，进一步提高，在提高的指导下继续普及。今后，职工业余文艺活动在坚持为工农兵服务、为社会主义建设服务的原则下，必须坚定地贯彻“百花齐放、推陈出新”的方针，坚持业余和自愿的原则，把职工业余文艺活动推向一个更加普及、更加提高的新阶段。职工业余文艺工作者应该加强政治学习，加强对毛泽东同志著作的学习，加强文化和文艺理论的学习，不断提高自己的政治思想水平、文化水平和艺术水平。职工业余文艺队伍是工人阶级自己的文艺队伍，应当努力遵循毛泽东的文艺方向前进，为社会主义和共产主义的文学艺术作出更多更大的贡献！
