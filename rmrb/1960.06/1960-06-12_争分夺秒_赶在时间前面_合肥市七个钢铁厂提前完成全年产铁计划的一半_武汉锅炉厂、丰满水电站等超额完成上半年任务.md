Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 10th: Hefei City's seven steel plants have completed half of their annual national pig iron production plan from twenty-four to forty days ahead of schedule; they have also overfulfilled the iron transfer plan in support of Shanghai. From January to May, the average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces in these seven plants was 2.4, the average coke ratio was 0.98, and the qualified rate of pig iron was above 90%.

The Hefei Municipal Party Committee and the Party committees of various steel plants have strengthened their leadership over the technical transformation of blast furnaces this year and have focused on saving raw materials and coordinating the transportation of vehicles and ships to ensure the raw materials needed for the continuous rise in the production of small blast furnaces. Leading cadres in various plants, workshops, and blast furnaces are now taking the major night shifts, changing the past situation of lax night shift management. The Youth Leap Forward Furnace of the Provincial Political and Legal First Steel Plant has more than doubled its night shift output in May due to the strengthening of night shift leadership. At present, the employees of each plant have put forward the goal of striving for a comprehensive and substantial increase in production in June. The Provincial Party Steel Plant has proposed that pig iron production in June should increase by 10% compared with the actual output in May, ensuring the completion of the increased production plan three days ahead of schedule. This plant has also proposed five concrete measures to ensure the completion of the June production plan. Among them, it is stipulated that leading cadres at all levels should insist on going deep into the front line of production, focusing on daily, shift, and furnace output, and solving problems in a timely manner, so that key links are grasped by someone, key problems are grasped by someone, and the production of twenty-four hours a day is grasped by someone; continue to carry out the technical revolution movement centered on the four modernizations; carry out red flag competitions; strengthen raw material management; pay attention to further arranging production and life so that employees can combine work and rest. The other six plants have also put forward different struggle goals and concrete measures. In the first five days of June, various steel plants have completed 17.73% of the June pig iron production plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan: Wuhan Boiler Factory has focused on ideological education and production preparation work this year, achieving consecutive monthly successes. It has now completed the state plan for output value, output of major products, cost, and labor productivity for the first half of the year ahead of schedule. The product quality is excellent, and the qualified rate has reached 100%.

Now, the Wuhan Boiler Factory is summarizing the experience of organizing production in the first five months of this year, continuing to educate employees to prevent complacency and relaxation with the spirit of continuous revolution, and making early preparations for production in the third quarter from all aspects of materials, production plans, and technology to meet the new production upsurge.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun: Jilin Province's Fengman Hydropower Station completed its semi-annual production plan on May 31, with all indicators such as output value, output, quality, cost, and labor productivity fully meeting the requirements of the state plan for the first half of the year. As of the same day, it also created a record of six hundred and four days of safe operation. The main reason why this power station completed half of the annual plan in five months is that it carried out mass movements on a large scale and comprehensively strengthened technical and economic management. In order to strive to complete half of the annual plan in the first half of the year under the condition of low rainfall, they strengthened reservoir scheduling according to the principle of combining water storage and water use, balanced the use of water, launched a major competition for economic operation, and achieved less water use and more power generation, ensuring that the plan was overfulfilled every ten days and every month from January to May.

Taking safety as the key link to ensure safe operation is another important measure taken by this power station to ensure the early realization of the semi-annual plan. The entire power station carried out two major safety inspections from January to May, strengthened daily equipment maintenance and repair work, and dealt with equipment defects in a timely manner, thereby ensuring absolute safe operation.

The technical revolution movement of this power station, centered on the realization of mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, has also achieved great results. From January to May, the employees of the entire power station put forward more than 2,200 innovation suggestions, half of which have been adopted and applied to production.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining: The advanced collective that attended the National Congress of Heroes – Qinghai Province Wool Processing Factory – has, on the basis of monthly success, overfulfilled the total output value plan and the output plans of seven major products for the first half of the year by May 31; the other major product, carpet, overfulfilled the output plan for January to May. The labor productivity of the entire factory increased by 26.84% compared with the same period last year; the cost was reduced by 14.44% compared with the plan, and 36.53% compared with the same period last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan: Qingdao Sifang Locomotive Factory completed its semi-annual locomotive production task one month ahead of schedule.

Since the Great Battle of Red May, leading cadres at all levels of this factory have met in workshops, sections, and groups to work with the masses, discover problems from labor, and help solve them in a timely manner, setting off a new upsurge of technical innovation and labor competition. In May alone, the entire factory promoted 150 kinds of advanced experience, created six successful flow production lines and forty-four automated and semi-automated single machines, and manufactured many molds and other new equipment, freeing many people from manual operations and heavy physical labor.

Xinhua News Agency, Dalian-Lushun, 10th: The vast number of young workers on the industrial production front of Dalian-Lushun City have reported frequent good news in the production battle to strive to over fulfill half of the annual plan ahead of schedule in the first half of the year. At present, according to the statistics of only twenty-five major factories and mines, there are more than 23,500 young people and 453 young production collectives that have completed their semi-annual production plans ahead of schedule.

The vast number of young workers have always stood at the forefront of technical innovation. 50,000 young workers in eighty-eight units across the city participated in various three-combination groups, scientific research groups, and technical innovation commando teams. They have implemented more than 69,000 innovation suggestions, some of which have increased production efficiency by 320 times.

Actively learning and promoting advanced experience has become a good fashion for the vast number of young people in Dalian-Lushun City. The city's young people have organized more than 1,500 advanced experience dissemination and promotion teams, promoting 4,379 more significant advanced experiences and new technologies. Young people at Dalian Shipyard promoted advanced tools through the form of "knife competition," enabling young workers in the factory's machining system to quickly master the grinding technology of six to fifteen kinds of advanced tools, increasing production efficiency by one to six times.
