    Chairman Haxhi Lleshi, Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Albania, is an outstanding politician and military figure of the People's Republic of Albania, born in 1913 in the city of Dibra. From his youth, he possessed progressive ideas and openly opposed the criminal rule of the Sogu dynasty at the time. In 1941, he went into exile in Yugoslavia, where he, along with other Albanian exiles, engaged in the struggle against the Italian and German fascist occupation. In 1943, he secretly met with Hoxha and other party leaders in the Besa region of Tirana. From that time on, following the instructions of the Party, he established and led a guerrilla force in Peshkopi, steadily leading the local national liberation forces and victoriously fighting against local reactionary traitorous organizations.

In September of the same year, he was elected as a member of the National Liberation Committee. In May 1944, at the Anti-Fascist National Liberation Congress in Permet, he was elected as the Minister of Interior of the Anti-Fascist National Liberation Committee, which performed the functions of the Albanian Provisional Government. After national liberation, he continued to serve as Minister of Interior for a period of time, later attaining the rank of General and holding an important position in the Ministry of National Defense for a period. At the First Party Congress in 1948, he was elected as an alternate member of the Central Committee. At the Third Party Congress, he was elected as a member of the Central Committee.
