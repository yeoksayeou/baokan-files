　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 15th - According to a revelation today by "Soviet Navy News," the United States and the West European member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are accelerating the refitting of their fleets and equipping warships with rocket weapons. After U.S. imperialism wrecked the four-government summit conference, the scale of this war preparation activity has been further expanded. The newspaper said that this once again proves the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and Western European countries to intensify their arms expansion and war preparations.

　　"Soviet Navy News" said that in the work of arming fleets with rocket weapons, the scale of activities carried out by the United States is the most massive. The Pentagon is currently implementing a plan to replace warships equipped with ordinary weapons with warships carrying rocket weapons. Other Western European countries are also purchasing rocket weapons from the United States to refit their fleets, and individual countries are also manufacturing their own rocket weapons and new warships carrying rocket weapons.

　　"Soviet Navy News" said that Britain is planning to build eleven "Tribal" class cruisers, which will be equipped with "Sea Cat" anti-aircraft missile weapons. France is also manufacturing and testing various types of missiles in order to arm cruisers. Although West Germany does not yet have warships equipped with missile weapons, the militarists in Bonn are actively preparing to obtain such weapons for the fleet. According to the West German "Die Welt," by 1963, the West German Navy will have destroyers equipped with U.S. missile weapons.

    美国海军备战活动规模庞大
    美英法西德等国加紧用火箭武器改装舰队
    新华社莫斯科15日电　据“苏联海军报”今天揭露，美国和北大西洋公约组织的西欧成员国，正在加紧改建舰队并以火箭武器装备军舰。在美帝国主义破坏了四国政府首脑会议以后，这种备战活动的规模更加扩大了。这家报纸说，这再次证明了美帝国主义和西欧国家加紧扩军备战的阴谋。
    “苏联海军报”说，在以火箭武器武装舰队的工作中，美国进行的活动的规模最庞大。五角大楼目前正在实现一项计划，以便用载有火箭武器的军舰来代替装有普通武器的军舰。西欧其他国家也向美国购买火箭武器以改装自己的舰队，个别国家也在自己制造火箭武器和载有火箭武器的新式军舰。
    “苏联海军报”说，英国正在计划建造十一艘“特列波尔”型的巡洋舰，这种巡洋舰上将装有“海猫”式高射导弹武器。法国也正在制造和试验各种类型的导弹，以便武装巡洋舰。西德目前虽然还没有装有导弹武器的军舰，但是，波恩的军国主义者正在为舰队取得这种武器作积极的准备工作。据西德“世界报”报道，到1963年，西德海军将有装备有美国导弹武器的驱击舰。
