    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 26th. The Soviet "Pravda" today, in an article commenting on Nobusuke Kishi's announcement of resignation, pointed out that Washington is prepared to sacrifice a puppet to salvage its bankrupt policy and its military alliance with Japan. However, the people's anger will sooner or later completely bury the U.S.-Japan military treaty, and the Japanese people's struggle continues to grow stronger and develop.

    The commentary stated that Nobusuke Kishi, like a thief, violated national interests by signing and "ratifying" the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and now he is preparing to step down.

    The article said that the Japanese people, who suffered heavy sacrifices due to the Japanese militarists' policy of aggression, clearly understand that a military alliance with the United States is a path to the restoration of militarism and a path to new disasters. The Japanese people also understand that this thoroughly aggressive treaty threatens peace and security in the Far East.

     The "black treaty" has been "ratified," but the Japanese people's struggle against militarism continues to surge.

    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 27th. The "People's Daily" today published an editorial on Nobusuke Kishi's decision to resign, saying that this victory of the Japanese people strengthens the confidence of every progressive and revolutionary person: since Nobusuke Kishi, the "Nobusuke Kishi of Turkey," and the "Nobusuke Kishi of Korea" have all stepped down, the "Nobusuke Kishi types" of other countries, especially those countries that have fallen into the traps of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the Central Treaty Organization, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Balkan Treaty, and the ANZUS Treaty, will also step down one by one. The newspaper said that the East Wind prevails over the West Wind, and these "Kishi types" are powerless to resist it. The East Wind is blowing stronger and stronger, and the current situation is even more unfavorable to imperialists and other reactionaries.

    The editorial expressed the warmest congratulations to the national democratic forces of Japan. The editorial said that, under the leadership of the working class, they have waged a patriotic and heroic struggle and have achieved remarkable accomplishments.

    苏联“真理报”评岸信介宣布辞职
    日本人民的愤怒终将埋葬日美军事条约
    印度尼西亚“人民日报”说岸信介是各国反动派的殷鉴
    新华社莫斯科26日电　苏联“真理报”今天在一篇评岸信介宣布辞职的文章中指出，华盛顿准备牺牲一个傀儡来挽救它破了产的政策，挽救它同日本的军事同盟，但是，人民的愤怒迟早会彻底埋葬日美军事条约，日本人民的斗争仍然在继续壮大和发展。
    评论说，岸信介像小偷一样，违背民族利益，签订并“批准”了日美“安全条约”，现在他准备下台了。
    文章说，由于日本军阀的侵略政策而遭受过沉重牺牲的日本人民清楚地懂得，同美国的军事同盟是恢复军国主义的道路、是走向新的灾难的道路。日本人民还了解，这一彻头彻尾的侵略条约威胁着远东的和平与安全。
      “黑条约”“批准”了，但是，日本人民反对军国主义的斗争仍然在继续高涨着。
    新华社雅加达27日电　“人民日报”今天就岸信介决定辞职发表社论说，日本人民的这个胜利加强了每一个进步人士和革命者的这种信心：既然岸信介、“土耳其的岸信介”、“朝鲜的岸信介”全都下台了，其它国家的“岸信介之流”，特别是堕入东南亚条约组织、中央条约组织、北大西洋公约组织和巴尔干条约以及美澳新条约的圈套的那些国家的“岸信介之流”，也一定会一个一个地下台。报纸说，东风压倒西风，这些“岸信介”对此无能为力。东风正在吹得越来越强劲，目前的形势更加不利于帝国主义者和其他的反动派。
    社论表示最热烈地祝贺日本的民族民主力量。社论说，在工人阶级领导下，他们进行了爱国的英勇的斗争，并且赢得了惊人的成就。
