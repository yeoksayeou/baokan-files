Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, June 1st. The Albanian construction industry has seen a leap forward in the era of the people's regime. In 1959, the total construction volume increased thirty-eightfold compared to 1938, before liberation. The total construction volume completed last year would have taken two hundred and forty years to complete during the old Zog dynasty.

The Albanian government attaches great importance to the development of the construction industry. During the fifteen years from 1945 to 1959, the People's Government invested 37 billion leks in construction, building many new factories, power stations, and brand-new hospitals, schools, railways and highways that had never existed before. These include the Stalin Textile Integrated Factory with an annual output of 20 million meters of fabric, a sugar refinery with an annual output of more than 10,000 tons of sugar, the Marx Hydropower Station with an annual power generation of 120 million kilowatt-hours, and the Cilik and Stalin oil refineries with an annual refining capacity of 300,000 tons, as well as new factories for cement, bricks, tiles, and sawmill materials.

New projects are being built everywhere in Albania. For example, the Shkope and Bistrica hydropower stations, the Kurbnesh copper mine, the Tirana Food Factory, and seven fruit and vegetable canneries in Shkodër and other places are currently under construction. This year alone, there are sixty-seven important projects that have started or are continuing to be built.

In the past fifteen years, in addition to building public welfare facilities such as hospitals, nurseries, and theaters, the People's Government has also built new houses with an area of 1.2 million square meters for the working people.

With the development of the construction industry, the ranks of Albanian construction workers have grown year by year, especially the rapid increase in engineering and technical cadres. In less than two years starting from 1957, the number of senior engineering and technical personnel increased fivefold, and the number of intermediate technical personnel increased elevenfold.

Thanks to the care of the Party and the government for construction workers, and the adoption of new technologies in the construction industry, construction workers have been freed from heavy physical labor since liberation. In 1959, the degree of mechanization in the construction industry increased eightfold compared to 1949. At present, 86% of earth excavation and transportation operations have been mechanized, and the mechanization degree of concrete mixing has reached 82%.

In order to further develop the construction industry, the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party recently made a special resolution. The Central Committee proposed to raise the construction industry to a higher technical level to meet the growing needs of Albania's socialist construction. The Central Committee pointed out that more attention should be paid to productive construction projects, improve labor organization, increase labor productivity, promote advanced experience, and increase the degree of mechanization in construction. The resolution also pointed out that attention should be paid to training technicians and skilled workers, and to strengthen propaganda and education for the vast number of construction workers to raise their awareness.

    阿尔巴尼亚建筑业飞跃发展
    去年建筑工程总量比解放前增三十八倍
    新华社地拉那1日电　阿尔巴尼亚建筑业在人民政权年代中有了飞跃的发展。1959年建筑工程总量比解放前1938年增大了三十八倍。去年所完成的整个建筑工程总量，在旧王朝索古时代需要二百四十年才能完成。
    阿尔巴尼亚政府十分重视建筑业的发展。在从1945年到1959年的十五年期间，人民政府用于建筑方面的投资达三百七十亿里克，建成了许多过去从未有过的新工厂、电力站和崭新的医院、学校以及铁路和公路等。其中有年产二千万米的织品斯大林纺织联合工厂，年产一万多吨糖的制糖厂，年发电量为一亿二千万度的马克思水电站和一年炼油三十万吨的柴立克与斯大林两个炼油厂，以及水泥、砖瓦、锯木等各种建筑材料的新工厂。
    阿尔巴尼亚到处都在兴建新的工程。如目前正在兴建的有：什科佩蒂和比斯特里察两座水力发电站、库尔拜莱西选铜厂、地拉那食品工厂和斯库台等地的七个水果蔬菜罐头厂等。单是今年开工和正在继续建设的重要工程就达六十七项。
    十五年来，人民政府除建造医院、托儿所和剧院等公共福利设施外，还为广大劳动人民兴建了面积达一百二十万平方米的新住宅。
    随着建筑业的发展，阿尔巴尼亚建筑工人的队伍一年比一年壮大，特别是工程技术干部在迅速增加。在从1957年开始的不到两年的时间内，高级工程技术人员就增长了五倍，中级技术人员增长了十一倍。
    由于党和政府对建筑工人的关怀，以及在建筑业中采用新技术的结果，解放以来建筑工人摆脱了笨重的体力劳动。1959年建筑业中的机械化程度比1949年提高了八倍。目前在挖土和运土的操作中已有86％实现了机械化，搅拌混凝土的机械化程度已达82％。
    为了进一步发展建筑业，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会最近专门作出了决议。党中央提出要把建筑业提高到更高的技术水平，以适应阿尔巴尼亚社会主义建设日益增长的需要。党中央指出，要更多地关心生产性的建筑工程，改善劳动组织，提高劳动生产率，推广先进经验和提高施工中的机械化程度。决议并指出，应该注意培养技术人员和熟练工人，加强对广大建筑工人的宣传教育工作，以提高他们的觉悟。
