    Hit Back at the American Imperialists with High-Yield "Shells"!
    By Our Reporters Hong Helin and Lü Xinchu
   "Turn endless anger into unparalleled drive!" "Use high-yield 'shells' to fiercely strike back at the American imperialists!" Under the resounding slogans, the working class of the capital, while grasping production with one hand, and writing poetry and painting to drive away the "plague god" with the other, is contributing new material and spiritual strength to oppose American imperialist aggression, resolutely liberate Taiwan, and defend world peace!
    In the past few days, the roar of opposition to American imperialism has resounded throughout many factories in the capital, and new production triumphs have been reported everywhere. On June 25th, the tenth anniversary of the American imperialists' launch of the Korean War, reporters came to the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant to participate in a workers' anti-American poetry recital. As soon as they entered the factory, they were immediately swept into a strong anti-American wave. More than a dozen loudspeakers were broadcasting the real-time report of the capital's people's rally against American imperialist aggression in Korea and in support of the Korean people's peaceful reunification of their fatherland to various workshops. The passionate "Resist America, Aid Korea" war songs, thunderous applause, and the deafening roar of machines intertwined to form the strongest sound against American imperialism and in defense of peace.
    In the factory's club, anti-American poems and paintings covered the walls. In a "close-up" of the plague god Eisenhower, the left side of his face was swollen into a large blister by the people's giant palm, and the right side of his forehead was imprinted with the character "炮" (pào - cannon) – a "gift" newly presented to him by soldiers on the Fujian front. Many workshops had anti-American big-character posters plastered along the walkways. A worker told the reporter that in the past six or seven days, the entire factory's staff, from veteran workers in their fifties to apprentices, had written more than 3,000 anti-American poems. At some anti-American gatherings, workers spontaneously composed poems, and their indignation immediately turned into verses: "The workshop becomes a 'battlefield,' tools become 'weapons,' high yield is a 'shell,' fire at the head bandit Eisenhower! Fire! Fire!" "Hearing the cannon fire from the Fujian front fills us with energy, the more we strike, the more relieved we feel, the more we work, the more vigorous we become..." The "Machine Tool Leap Forward News," just published by the factory, reflects the results of the staff's actions to fiercely "bomb" the plague god in the past week: the production records in the forging workshop are being broken every day, furnaces No. 1 and No. 6 are working together, completing seven days' worth of targets in one day; the heavy machinery workshop is launching an "Eight Comparisons" competition, making a crash effort to produce "July 1st" (Party Founding Day) gift products; the cooks are delivering meals to the front line; the tool workshop has continuously launched four high-yield and high-quality campaigns.
    After dinner, workers, holding red flags and beating gongs and drums, went to the Party Committee to report the day's production achievements. Afterwards, they flocked to the auditorium to participate in the anti-American poetry recital. Those who arrived later had no seats, so they simply stood and listened. The chairman of the trade union used impassioned verses to deliver the opening remarks:
    Ten years ago today, the American imperialists ignited the flames of war in Korea;
    Also, ten years ago, the American imperialists occupied our motherland's territory of Taiwan;
    Now, the crazy jackals are stirring up trouble in Asia again with new conspiracies...,
    Poetry is a weapon, a shell,
    Let it expose the American imperialists' conspiracy,
    Let it pronounce the American imperialists' death sentence!
    Workers who had just finished their day shift, some still wearing their oil-stained work clothes, took to this battle platform one after another. A line of poetry was followed by a burst of war drums; each roar of anger stirred up rounds of applause. Old worker Lan Derong, who had attended the Beijing Municipal Congress of Heroes, could not restrain his angry mood and wrote a poem on the spot, immediately going on stage to recite it: "Eisenhower is the number one murderer, he ignores the people's opposition and makes himself hated everywhere, his aggressive nature will not change, he will definitely be finished soon!" As soon as the poem was finished, enthusiastic applause erupted from the audience.
    Interspersed with the poetry recital were various forms of artistic performances, including shadow plays, clapper talks, double acts, rhyming tales, and crosstalk. The workers wrote and performed their own pieces, stripping the American imperialists' "peaceful" disguise to its bare bones.
    The poetry recital ended amid a highly emotional atmosphere. Large banners on both sides of the stage read "Use our actual actions to severely strike the American imperialists" and "Turn anger into strength and ensure that June production surpasses May." The workers do not make empty promises. When the reporter left this boiling factory, the workshops were brightly lit, engaging in a high-yield battle. The tool workshop completed 5,100 work-hour quotas, one-quarter more than the third high-yield day, and the product variety and quality also met the standard requirements. When the reporter asked him what the reason was, he smiled and replied: "There is no secret, it is mainly driven by anti-American passion!"

### 用高产“炮弹”回击美帝！

    用高产“炮弹”回击美帝！
    本报记者  洪和临  吕新初
   “把无穷的激怒化为无比的干劲！”、“用高产的‘炮弹’狠狠回击美帝！”。首都的工人阶级，在这响亮的战斗口号声中，一手大抓生产，一手写诗作画逐“瘟神”，为反对美帝侵略、坚决解放台湾、保卫世界和平贡献着新的物质力量和精神力量！
    这几天，首都许多工厂里，反对美帝的吼声震天响，新的生产捷报处处传。25日，美帝发动侵朝战争十周年的日子，记者来到北京第一机床厂参加工人反美诗歌朗诵会。刚一进厂，就立刻被卷进强烈的反美怒涛中去。十多个扩音器正在把首都人民反对美帝侵略朝鲜、支持朝鲜人民和平统一祖国大会的实况转播到各个车间。激昂的抗美援朝战歌，雷动般的掌声，隆隆震耳的机器声，交织成反对美帝、保卫和平的最强音。
    这个工厂的俱乐部里，反美诗画满墙。一幅瘟神艾森豪威尔的“近照”上，左脸被人民的巨掌打肿成一个大疱，右额头还印着一个“炮”字——这是福建前线战士新赠送给他的“礼品”。不少车间的走道两旁，贴满反美大字报。一位工人告诉记者：最近六七天当中，全厂职工从五十多岁的老工人到徒工，共写了三千多首反对美帝的诗歌。在一些反对美帝的集会上，工人们出口成章，激愤马上变成了诗篇：“车间变‘战场’，工具当‘武器’，高产是‘炮弹’，向狗强盗头子艾森豪威尔开炮！开炮！”、“一听福建前线的炮声，就混身是劲，越打越解恨，越干越起劲……”。这个厂刚刚出版的“机床跃进报”上反映了一周来职工们用实际行动猛“轰”瘟神的战果：锻工车间生产纪录日日新，一号炉、六号炉联合作业，一天完成七天指标；重型车间掀起“八比”竞赛热潮突击“七一”献礼产品；炊事员送饭上阵地；工具车间连续搞了四个高产优质战役。
    晚饭吃过，工人们举着红旗，敲起锣鼓到党委会来宣读当天生产喜报。随后又成群结队拥向大礼堂参加反美诗歌朗诵会。后来的人没有地方坐，索兴站着听。工会主席用激愤的诗句说了开场白：
    十年前的今天，美帝燃起侵朝战火；
    也是十年以前，美帝侵占了祖国领土台湾；
    现在，疯狂的豺狼，又带着新阴谋来亚洲乱串……，
    诗是武器，是炮弹，
    让它把美帝的阴谋揭穿，
    让它把美帝的死刑宣判！
    刚下白班的工人，有的还穿着油污的工作服，一个接一个奔上这战斗的讲坛。一句诗，接着是一通战鼓；一声声怒吼，激起了一阵阵掌声。曾经出席北京市群英会的老工人蓝德荣按捺不住激怒的心情，在会场上挥笔写成一首诗，马上登台朗诵道：“艾森豪威尔是头号杀人凶犯，他不顾人民反对，到处惹人讨厌，侵略本性不会变，不久一定完蛋！”诗音未落，台下立即引起一阵热烈的掌声。
    诗歌朗诵中，还穿插着各种形式的文艺演出，拉洋片、快板、双簧、数来宝、相声，工人们自编自演，把美帝国主义的“和平”外衣剥得一丝不留。
    诗歌朗诵会在群情激昂中结束了。舞台两旁的大幅标语“用我们实际行动狠狠打击美帝”、“把怒火化为力量定叫6月生产超5月”。工人们是不说空话的。当记者离开这个沸腾的工厂时，各个车间里灯火通明，展开高产战斗。工具车间完成了五千一百个工时定额，比第三个高产日又高出四分之一，产品品种、质量也都合乎标准要求。记者问他原因在哪里，他笑着回答说：“没有什么秘诀，主要是反美激情支配的呗！”
