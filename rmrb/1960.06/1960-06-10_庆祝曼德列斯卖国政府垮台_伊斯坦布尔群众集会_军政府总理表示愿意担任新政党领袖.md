Xinhua News Agency, 9th June, Ankara: A rally of 200,000 people was held in Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, on the 8th, to celebrate the collapse of the Menderes government, which betrayed national interests, and to commemorate the martyrs who sacrificed themselves in the struggle. It is reported that students and citizens from all walks of life participated in the rally held in two squares in Istanbul, holding huge banners. The banners read "We cannot live without freedom!" and "No more dictatorship!" The banners also carried slogans paying tribute to the dead.

It is reported that a rally will be held in Ankara on the 10th to mourn the martyrs who were killed in the demonstrations against the Menderes government. Some of the victims' bodies discovered in Istanbul have been transported to Ankara by train. Students will carry these bodies in a procession through the city of Ankara on the 10th.

Xinhua News Agency, 8th June, Ankara: Turkish military government Premier Gursel told reporters on the 7th that he was willing to serve as the leader of a new political party. According to Western news agencies, a new political party composed of military personnel is about to be born in order to participate in the next general election.

A Turkish government spokesman announced on the 6th that the Turkish government would soon announce a provisional constitution. According to Agence France-Presse, the provisional constitution stipulates that the legislative powers will be exercised by the "National Unity Committee." The spokesman of the "National Unity Committee" officially announced on the 2nd that the committee had taken over all the powers of the Turkish National Assembly. The "National Unity Committee" which launched this Turkish military coup is composed of twenty military officers, most of whom are field grade officers. The chairman of the committee is the former Commander of the Ground Forces, Gursel.

The corruption scandals of the members of the former Menderes traitorous dictatorial government, fostered by US imperialism, continue to be exposed.

Two receipts for 4.5 million lira and 2.5 million lira respectively were also found in his home. Former Finance Minister Polatkan took possession of two ships purchased by the state.

    土耳其政府发言人在6日宣布，土耳其政府即将公布临时宪法。据法新社透露，临时宪法规定立法部门的职权将由“全国团结委员会”来执行。“全国团结委员会”的发言人在2日正式宣布，这个委员会已经接管了土耳其国民议会的全部权力。发动这次土耳其军事政变的“全国团结委员会”是由二十名军官组成的，其中大部分是校官，委员会的主席是前地面部队司令古尔塞勒。
